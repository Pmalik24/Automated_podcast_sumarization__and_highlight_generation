sa showspanserba expressvepian you a rod history being seen and sold to advertisers no meaneither can expressvy pian wright now expressly piansicom flashman last week a cloudin ga objectively humiliated herself before congress sh's the president of harvard just a recall her performance here was some of the highlagt reel i will ask you one more time thaes calling for the ganicide of jews violate harvard's rules of bullying and harassment yespor no anticimtic retoric n an isantiematic raterat anticimitic retoric when it crosses into conduct hat amounts to vollyang arasment intimidation that is actionaf a conduct and we do take action the anser is yest that calling for the genicide of jews oviolates harvard cot of conduct correct again it depends on the contact it is not to pendon the contacts the anser is yes and this is why you should resign oket that was harvard's esteemed t president again failing to simply state the calling for genicide of jews was not violation of harvard' speech policies instead cloudin gay supposedly clung to free speech violation of which is constants and ever present at harvard here for example is an exerpt from harvard's manitory title mine training session for undergraduate students it contains equot power and control wheel that helps students identify harmfolt conduct it says quat around the edge of the powering control wheeld you will notis attitudes beleas an systems racism sexism misogeny ablism transfobia and seenaphobia these apparently quot contribute to an invironment that perpetuates violancs oun recognize some of these terms sis hetero seism which is the idea that being sisgender meating a boy who knows he is a boy and hetero sextual and believing that is the norm is somehow a form of discrimination according to one of the presented cenarios in the titalline training quote andres repeated using the wrong pronounce comment about logan's appearance making remarks about logan's gener identity contribute to a climate of disrespect an may also violate harvard's policy if you say a man is a man you maybe violating harvard's policies if you say death to the jews well context dependents this is the same university youwill recall that ban prospective admity cilcashof the parkland high scholl for sending tacts that included the enward in them when he was sixteen years old but clouding gay is all about free speech for the jew haters again the only way to explain all this is that it is part and parcel of the equity hierarchy established by the academic left over the quourts of at least two generations some groups under this rubric ar more equal than other groups and clouing gay is part of the privileged releet she is one of those groups that is why she is unlike lismc gill over at pen unfirable was mc gill is white clouding gay is black that means clouding ga cannot be fired this week cris rufo and erran sibarium and other journalists on covered vast evidence of gas alleged plagurism from her piachty discertation to other multipl published papers multiple professors woere plageris 've now come forward to condamigates platrism that includes byami university professor and williamson h said quote it does look plagerism to me if they are goin to do what they did i should be cided as reference my first reaction is shock a second is puzzlement i'll shed to doas give me credit cerell swain another scholar gay llegedly plage ris had quote when as bothering me is not just that there is passages she did not putin quotation marks when i look at her work i feel her whole research agender her whole carreer was based on my work swan actually wen a lot further she said quote she became president of harvard and got recognition as being its first black president in do not believe her record warranted ten yur i believe i had to met a much higher standar than she did it is clear to me standards were lowered in the mid nineteen nineties and the leads came together and decided they were going to defend a firmit of action it is clear to me she was a benefissiary of that i blame her committee and i blame it white progressives equally swain whois black concluded quote white progressives have always rewarded the blacks u supported their ideas a white mail would probably already begone that of course is exactly right but not at harvard where the board has full scale defendic clouding gay saying they did a for investigation into the plaguris malligations as soon as they received wind of them back in october but here is the thing even that was apparently a li equity has to be upheld at all cost particularly at the cost of the truth truth i just not a value to the ratical left it turns out that the university once hit with plagerofs anmalligations against gay bacond october did not investigate instad they went into full defence mode according to theark post quote harvard university covered up a high level investigation into whether it is controversal president was a plagurist and used an expensive lawfrom to threaten the post over our own probe the post contact of theuniversity and october twenty fourth asking for comment on more than two dozen instances n which gazes words appeared to closely parallel words phrases or sentences an published worke by other acodemics when the post brought the alligations to harvard jonathan swain its senior executive director of media relations and communications asked for more times reviews gate to review gayes work a day later swain who is part of the biging heris transitionteam and a one time hillery clinton aid said he would quote get back in touch over the next couple of days but he did not two days later on o tober twenty seventh the post was instead sent a fifteen page letter by tomas clair a high powered virginia based attorney with the firm clair lock whi dentified himself as defamation council for harvard university and gay there is a tacit threat issued two the neor post not to print a story about gazes lleged plagerism tbecause of defamation concerns harvard must defend the pressius gay is the perfect emblem of equity an under qualified black woman who 's been elevated particularly because of that status to the presidency of the nations most story university she is two woke to fail becuse if she fails what does that say about the entire petumpcan village of diversity equity and inclusion

principl and harvard is a university totally reliant on d e i diversity equity and inclusion principles as gave herself sadin a statemen after the supreme cort throughout a firmative action as on constitutional quote the fundamental principle that dpen transformitve teaching learning and research depend upon a community comprising people of many backgrounds perspectives and lived experiences that principle is as true and important to day as it was yesterday too are the abiding values that have enabled us and every great image educational institution to pursue the high calling of educating creative thinkers and bull leaders of deepening human knowledge an of promoting progress justice in human flourishing now harvar does not mean that in terms of ideas of course er lik two register re publicans at the entirity of harvard it is wildly stacked to the left the entire faculty of harvard might have a dozen professors who voted republican in the last election cycle maybe what is harvard mean an terms of diversity they man in an tfroms vrace this is why according to te harvard crimson in an analysis of the puriod nineteen ninety five to do thousand thirteen that is an eighteen yor period asian americans admitted to harvard earned an average ust eigh t score of seven sixty seven across all section that is an average of fifteen thirty fore in average hoa emcans that there art un of asian students for gettng a sixteen hundarad which is the maximum viouliok of the charg that i've put oup peragans from the harvard crimson look at that red line it is far and away above every ofthe race it is insane meanwhile white admets they were forced to earn an average of seven forty five across all sections that of course would be a fourteen ninety a very very high score hispanics however had to earn an average of seven eighteen that is a fourteen thirty six black admets com in dad last even after native american admets they had to earn an average of seven o four or a fourteen o eight on the ssa t that is the average esay t score remember that is not the top asa t score that is not the bottom as eight score that is the average s a t score in other words the average harvard asian american had to out perform the average black admitt at harvard by a hundred and twenty six points two get in i promise you by the way that the spread on asian am erican admitees does not go allthe wy down to thirteen hundred it is not as though ter bunch of asian mericans who got in with the thirteen hundred but if you have a fourteen o eight black averas an mings are a lot of blacksunes ho got in wite a thirteen hundred and some that got in with the fifteen hundred for contact a fourteen oeight is below the averageist a tescore for admitees at every top university in the united states it is below the average at every topin versity lick pick university renk number twenty is below the average admit at that university the only way to justify thes sort of racism is to suggest that there are other benefits that come to harvard from admitting people who are black other then difference of perspective and an essayteescore cause lowerasatscores and also not a different perspective what are those other benefits while the unspoken assumption is that a racially diverse student body or faculty or administration is self justifing now why would racial quotas be self justifying there is only one reason because meritocracy itself is supposedly un just and wrong and races youre doing something good merely by putting people of verios skin colors in a room together because if you were to a judicate based on merit that would be inherently bad its not that the room that is more diverses inherently good is that the thing that that opposes the meritocracy is inherently bad and tht is precisely the proposition that harvard puts forward this why minds everywhere are boggling at harvard the apac of the supposed american meritocracy right you only getinto harvard your high achiever ten i got in to harvard law it' because i got one seventy six on my elsat it is not because i was promoting that versity of vieupoint tin care about that this is why people are freeking out that harvard again supposed wbe have about about the mritocracy is now promoting thaversity equity an inclusion in the face of merit and in fact making clear that if your part of a higher athivin group this makes you in a presser who can be and should be discriminated against but of course that is what universities have been promoting for decades clouding gay is the natural consequente of that perversity this is why deric johnson of the en doublacy p has now twe to quote enough is enough harvard president clouding gay is a distinguished scholar in professor with decades of service in higher education the recent attacks on her leadership are nothing more than political theatrics advancing a white supremisist agenda black america is not buying into your game and we sure will not stand for your perpetuation of missacenoir missachenoir by the way is a fage term that wase coins in the nineties to refer to discrimination against black women according to the president of the en dublacy p pointing out the gay participated in precisely the same activity that got lismac gill fired lismagill'e white that is now racis even though gay is guilty probably of plagerism an lismac gill is not be lisma gi got fired gay will not be why because clouding gay again is black plagerism is just now another front for racism according to the d e i left any merit cratic system any color blind system is now a front for racism if it has disproportion at effects according to the equity crowd whether it is as a tscores or grade or crinel law or drug law or free speech or property rights this is the game rig the game in favor of those who under achieve pretending that under achievement is the fault of the meritocracy itself and therefore given benefits to those who under achieve is an attempt to break the racis system and then when you are challenge you claim that those who are pointing out short comings and failures those people are racis and representatives of the corrupt and exploittative sutal meritocratic hierarchy d i is a cult philosophy it is false but utterly unfalsifiable because it is rooted in the quarp belief that if you oppose d i your bigit and thre's no way to opposed ya that is the game that deric johnson is plan when he attacks bill acman the private equity gooru and harvardlam whos been trying to fight antistemitism on campis acman has ben attackngantitemitism on campis at harvard an mi t at upen will johnson is now acusing acman who is a democrat by the way of being a rasis here is johnson quote acman's statement on president game and acquitting aversity equity and inclusion initiatives to modern demicarthiism have nothing to do with combating antitemitism rather says johnson ackman is choosing to inflame anti woke culture wars against the most visible blacwoman he could target yes according to the d i friendlin to bow to bill acman again a major democratic owner would be to bow to racism johnson is now even calling for boycot against the business is in which acman invests business is by the liitha bevia black employes quote ackman can be held to countable for his actions his hedge fun pershing square is a major investran chopotliht los popies and burgriking among other major contoma rans blackwomen have the palar todside whether these brands should continue to earn their patronage and the boards an employes of thse company's conspeak up as well the d i li has to be upheld at all costs if it falls tut is the theory that american meritocracy is itself evil and that is the cors theory that is the theory that lies at the rooted of the lefts ideological revolution it under gurds thei're support for everything from ratical trans politics to the blacklives matter movement to chamas every one was unsuccessful in life is victims of a merit cratic movemens that is actually not about merit it is actually about racism that is the cuorp principle of diversity aquity and enclution d i is a cancer but that canceros tumer cannot simply be removed because it is too late it is matastasized throughout our universities across our body politic it has to be hit with socital kemotheraby a

bidin administration is still futzing around on the ucrane war i do not understand the political postering here i will never understand the political postering here it does not make any sense to me vladmers lensky theoucranian president visited the white house on tuesday he was attempting to garner suport for more funding for the ucrane war of course zolensk's ben over promising key and the rest of nato allies that theyve been promising that an offensive against russia would end up winning back the don bass region as well as crimea and none of that has happened because basically you now have world war one trench warfare accompaniy by lot of drones and nothing is going to change along those borders and people had an outsizes perception of what was possible in this area which means that on the pushback vladmer puten now has a bit of an advantage now that does not mean the landerpouten has notbeen absoly cripple by this war he has according to a new report from seanan national security correspondint katy bullilis who is herself reporting on a newly to classifighd youus intelligence reportquote some pretty staggering numbers three hndred sixty thousand troops russia sentence you crane initially and then made up their entire standing ground fors prior to the invasion of that three hundred sixty thousand troups three hundred and fifteen thousand were lost on the battle fiel tan asnan eighty seven per cent lost of russia standing ground forces befor the invasion now russia has been relying on for example the wagner group and a a bunch of others or private malitias in order to fill that yap they have been conscripting people in large numbers the basic puten theory here is out lasts the west and it is possible that he can out lasts the west because the west nmber one has not make clear an offram every war where the west does not make clear an offram is a war that than up lusing and two it is possible he can nout last the west because the democrats art art apparently more interesting political game then even in in providing the funding that is necessary to ou krane tere they would rather blame republicans for not getting the funding than actually get the funding that is ems to be the pattern here s a chucktium ros out there stumping for more aid to you crane he said es quotting's alensky and saying that russia is going to win here if an insolensky made it is clear how he needs help but if he gets the help he can win this war tand he outlines in some great detail a the cind of help he needs and howi will help can win evens many of our republicin colleagues talked eabout we we are winnin this war and if we get the help that if he gets the help he needs he will win on the other hand he made it clear and we all made it clear that if we lose pooten winds o kan bit i do not understand what you nean by winds and loses let' say the to borderstay where they are that is what you you crane is winning e united states won i gat that firstof all as always the united states has interest distinct from those of any other country is ral's interest are not always th united states interest you cranes interest are not always the unitedstates interest we are nation with our own national interest obviously wel when it comes to th ou crane war te american national interest was in crippling the russian military to prevent it from fighting of future wars against nato allies and breaking the nato a lines and for those who are sort of there there is this wear pattern that happens now that i've seen in form policy which is wen an't a farious power does he bad thing we then immediately blame the institution that was standing in the way when the drunk driver hit is the old lady crossing the street withhin blame the old lady for having been there it is really weird when commass attack is raily citizens in the goza envelopes at but why were they yeven that should isral even exist i don' even know when it comes to russia invading you crants well should why why do we need nato om because russha does things invade you crane now would be the reakson why you need nato and georgia and casitly and a bunch of other areas and any case the bottom line here is that russia has already lost heavy in terms wit is militere i's been crippled economically it 's been crippled militarily the united states arty achieved it is goal right there what exactly is the engull and this is where the by administration is not even articulating an engul they are making at political and stead the'r well as long as it takes with whatever it takes in if you oppose it you love pooten and also were not gon give you border security to even get what we want out of this that looks politic ant does not lok a care very much what hapens in you rane actually if you if yu hold that position it is very similar to the anti globa warming position that also says we we do not want new clear power well if you if you do not want carbon amissions you need new clear power wellif you want you crane funding you need border funding you need changes to borer lall these these two things are a package and yet the democrats e more interest in the virtue signaling than the actural funding for the thing they say they want you crane funding ellget to that momentarily first the holidays are here the last thing you need during this busy time of yours to miss out on a great

policy on the one hand thets to want all the funni n one frever and now on theother hand tit isto well gng give up nothing in order to achieve this john curby from the national security advisery he says we want you crane supporting what as long as it takes on then why do not you explain what exactly did you want di'd you mean you want to support you crane as long as it takes for russian out to invade the rest of you crane because i agree with that if what you mean is as long as it takes to free don bassin crimea i do not agree with that because that is the thing that is not going to happen in the absence of simply handing you crane tremendous air power it is not going to happen to change the situation on the ground here is john curby not articulating the in point when ask how long you are support feu crane will continue he says as long as it takes over and over and over again was he wrong no in fact that still his intention phill we want to be able to support you crane for as long as it takes the obviously we would all love this war to be over to morrow if it could be in terms that are acceptable to the craneand people but mister pouton shows absolutely no desire in ending this war sitting down and negotiating it all in fact quite the contrary he is now attacking energy and fit structure with mistles and drones trying to weaponise winter and we know that his forces on the ground are trying to go on an offensive in the east there is no indication that he is slowing down if you crane stops fighting that is the end of you crane well it is on about you crane stapping the fighting it is about what exactly they are fighting over is it more territory in that on bassor crima if do not see exactly what youre offerem herts but again i think a lot ofthit is now about postering jobiden yesterday he was speaking about you rane nusic well done re publicans the russians lov you uno we need fully appreciate fully appreciate how is wrong how this is bein ued around the world and bein used by russia russian loyal is to moscow celebrated we re when re publicins roted to block on crane a last wee the host of a cramblin ron sho litterly said ny cow well don republicans that is good for us and a co we said it again this host of a cramblin run shows a well done republic gs that is good for us that is e russion speakin if you bein celebrated by russian proper gandes might be trine to reach the what you do ga or you could make a deal with the republicans whod you control the house and our halftee's with you on the senate you could do that thing but tyou are not doing that thing and instead we now have an impass again this makes no political sense to me jobide in one in twenty twenty at least the democratic primaries and probably the precedency because his appearance was that of ha moderate not because he ran to his hard laft he did not he ran directly toward the middle that was his entire pitce was i'mean old person and i'm not going to do anything transformationa then of course he went into office hnd he started putting equity all over the federal government he started spending on precedented amounts of money and heu undermind our national security aby with drawing an aftanistan an all the rest that but the thing that won him election last time it was his supposed moderation and now hes running directly away from that and republicans are offering him an offeramp right here republicans by basically saying to him hey what lyng change border law and thn we'ld give you you craning they are offering him a win win he can now go back to his left to space hey less and i did not want to do anything bout the bord of a re publicans force me to it and then he go to middle american tay hey i did something about the border i that is something he could do but he is not doing it which means that he is helds tostage by his left wing base which is a weard thing to be held hostage bagon one of the issues were donal trump is going to hammer the living crap out of him if trump is de nominy which we presume he will be given the poles of this point if trump is not ominee it does not matter of it if it is iit is this anser thaley they will hammer him over the border hin being able to say i changed border policy should try to stop the flood at the border would be a smart thing it would be smart it would defray some of the cost of his crab bordepolicy far but he is not doing any of that mach mac conall who again is pro funding for you crane he sai lo could deal is practically impossible your not cin a budge on the border i a sad is cractily possible even no rechin grement to crafted i i sen i haus the for christas that do not mean it outum bord and even though weve been empesizing the border i woder remind everybody of the importance of you you cran get i mean again mc conall once you crane funding and even he is ting there is no deal without border meanwhile speaker the house my johnson he says yall ere goin to ned the border first a mean what wis the hard but i do not think it is a a ratical proposition to say that if we are going to hav a national security supplemental package it ought to begin with our own nationess curity first and and i'll exclain to him that while we understand that i've made my position veary clear literally sence the day was hand of the gaval that we have to take cure of our border firs well i mean again this 's a very consents his position in the united states we do not our border being open we do not fentinel being smuggled over the border do not any of that stuff and saying sure would give you cranemore funding to prevent russia from overunning it but also ween need to slidify our own border white the fact that this is even remotely controversal for democrats i want to know the counter argument what is the counter argument right here all they can say i meut honestly all they can say is we wish or part of a separate bill why tey could reject the border aid and then they could pass thyou cranade but they should just pass both and here is democratic senter remark kelles from ae arizona which is a border state and even he sang that we need some changes on the border but you knw in omage to jobide nume t pretnd tese two things shuld be separated we ave provided wore support for bort of retrol we need to do more the presideent supplemount had a funding in there for borta patral agence asylum officers judges a these are the things we a greon awe are talk ot about your cranade is realy maticarriang o tis things a funding for indo pay cob with a tocure issues with chin o leme leave it t at at that a for this tha being caught up in the politics of the border would be a mistake why whysa car fom the pout just just do the thane what the white house is making some signals at might do the things maybe reason is starting to penetrate there you always wonder according to see bes news the bid administration on tuesday indicatedst congressional aw makers would be willing to support a new border authority to expel migrants without asylum screenings as wells a dramatic expansion of emigration to tention and tuportations to convince re publicans to back ad su crane for people familiar with matter told se bes news the white house informed senate democrats it could back of those sweeping an hardline emigration policy changes as part of the negotiations over bidins emergency funding request it roughly one hundred billion dolar package that whose military as u crane israel and ti want during a press conference at the white house on tuesday biden said that his teem is working with tenan democrats and re publicans to try to find ay by partizan compromise both in terms of changes in policy and to provide at resources we need to secure the border apparently home lent security secretary of a hunger mailcus has been deployed to engage with negotiators in the senate this week specifically the white house is indicated it would support a new far reaching wegal authoritiy to allow yuus border officials to sumarily expel migrants without processing their asylum clams that measure would effectively revive titleforty to you re member title forty to and basidly tilizen we got cove it here when i can a let yet in jst go away iu wuld allow officials to pause youus asylum law without a public health justification the administration would also back an nation white expansion of a process known as expedted removal that allows emogration officials to aport migrants without quart hearins if they do not ask for asylum or if they failed their initial asylum interviews that program is currently limited to the border region moreover the white house would be willing to mantate the datention of certain migrans or allowed into the country pending the adjudication of their clames which by the way would mount to waihe for a wedvart kitsin cages why because it would mount to having families we are held inte tention but kids are not allowed to be held indetention and they would be exided and you would end up with heither kid 's in cages with the families or you non a with kid separated from their parentsto ar in the cages right tha there is no easy way to do this without just closing the boarder which is the thing th the bine administration is not willing to do whit that sad these are actual concessions re publicans should obviously ratchat those concessions the way that they want and if the white house is giing to sign on to it till acto be a god political movde for them i would not count on them making a good political move however because the're politically in competent which brings us to the latest from the israel commasswar yesterday jobidon stepped in the dudu and then had to have his nightnurs clean it up yesterday he a was speaking at apack apparently are at the home of o apack presen in former apa president less rozenburg and he said that israel was losing international supportintst war against commass first of all who gevs a fling international support aba eben who is the former ouan ambassador from israel he said that if there are you an resolution that the earth was flat and that israel had flattened it it would pass a hundred and sixty three to thirteen with twenty obstensions i mean that is bas go ad happened yesterday the you an general assembly had a resolution calling for a cease fire ind goza whos supported one sixty three ther ten votes against and thirteen abstensions who cares what youan has at te international commu vinternational community oh no what of the frenchgan with a woo a what why would israel stop killing the terrorist they need who kill in order to preserve their own security because because su dan is upse by thewys dansong ose w them because the bic a country that did not vote in favor of the nonses fire what why would israel be lik super oh mygosh oh no what are we going to do if crina does not support us killing terrorus in the gosestrip ridiculous ridiculous kind of stu what what exactly was his warning he said that nittinyaw who quote hase to change this government the government in israel is making it very difficult he said ultimately israel cannot say notes wat palistonian state which is really hardliners oppose he said what we have an opportunities begins unite the region and they still on do it but we have to make sure beby understands he' got to make some moves to strengthen et cannot say noe to a palistonian state that is going to be the hard part the times israel reported the bidens ad putnitinaw who is a good friend but i believe he needs to change that would be referring to his colishan partners those would be betzalle smotrich itmar benkveer soe members of the right wing block in his coalition bydon said what one of the things beeby understands that israel security can rest on the united states but right now it has more than the united states it has the e ou it has europe has want most of the world supporting them but there starting to lose that support by indiscriminate bombing that takes place he is such e's such a dullard israel is not indiscriminately bmbangaza if israel were indiscriminately bombing gosa you would not be talking about seventeen eighteen thousand people dad in gaza a huge percents goive them terroris you would be talk about hundreds of thousands of people

statistic which means that for every bom drop point seven seven people are being killed maybou do not now ho boms work typically bombs co more than point seven seven people when they are dropped in populated areas isral's ben deliberately avoiding exactly that sit not indiscriminet it is ri diculous language from bidon and histeam had to walkaback yesterday the other thin it is ridiculous is bidon and the left continuing to play this game has though policy be wildly different if the government were made up of somebody that did not include but solosmot rich and it is mour benkover hits a hold over from the judicial from the judicial reform nonsense in israel is that oh mi gotshur jus the different government while that that government be much more conciliatory toward the terrorist paliston and authority nope nope because first of all gessures in the goverment right now it is a unity government beny gons is part of the government gudon sar ispart of the government a yu ave to not know anything about his rally politics to suggest the right now the drivers of the boss when it comes to the war cabinet in israel are et tomour bengover and besolosmot rich it is not true it is

out that in this unity war time cabinet the people who have the most say right now are you benny gons who is the leader of the opposition party when tiet to now it s what bitin here is saying ridiculous obviously an dum and again he keeps saying these stupid things in the belief that if he sort of takes a middle road position that he is gon winsupportis on all sides which he is not going to just words o the wise hen you take a political position that pleases no one it tends to please no one and that is kind what jobiton is doing right now first what to green eggs your holiday family

war are very obvious and and ridiculous yesterday jobidon was talking about the israel commass war and he saibl israel has not a duty to innocent palistinians just going after commass whell you kow that that is tat does not mean that they get to kills it is not israel killing israel is the only party ig tiss conflict that gives any dams at all about the civilian which makes it much harder for isralld when youknow insulting it is labidon as san yesterday israel loss ten soldiers that is a lot of soldiers phrasrael a israel is not a large country everybody knows everybody ay ayve friends in israel are going to shivacalls which are the morning calls literally everyday for soldiers are being killed in israel ar being killed right now in the gossistrip the only reason those soldiers are dawing is ecause h israel is not using its own unbridled power in order to finish off commass israel is instead putting it is own sons ands auters in harms way they are putting them in urban street to street fighting and warfare in a in a really rough and difficult attempt to distinguish comasnex from actual civilians hecause one o the things comanics love to do is shield themselves with actuals villains which is wy there is plenty of vidio available of comas literally shooting civilians as they attempt to escape warzones it is whycomass is firing rockets from civilian designated sights wit is why they use you and depotes in order to fire rockets it is what they do while jobidon is doing this ridiculous routine about how israels be in discrimined and israel mumals puttin his own soldiers and harms wy atlec to shogovido this released by the idea this is what combat actually looks in the gossistrip as israely soldiers are wounded going house to house thees an actual peace a foot age released by the ide of his body camfootage in this particular vidio those whoe cansin what you will see is an israely soldier firing at a commas terroris the comas terroris he killes coms terras but th commas terras hrose a wernated wernade mos up he israely soldier is wounded he then proceeds well wounded to kill another commass terrace that point blank range he is going room to roon you cannot see anything this is what acton orbin combat wit i newmotr by i alther being in discriminate it is insulting to what these raly soldiers are doing right now iud be similarly insulting if we said that itby the way it was insulting when borakoboma back in to thousan at youwill recall actually suggested that america was indiscriminantly bombing civilians in afganistandurember he said this into thousan ade iwas deeply insulting to american soldiers woere instead going house to house risking their own lives not to kill civilians many of whom were being used as human shields by terrorists the sort of stuff is its it is it is war talk for people who literally know nothing about war that is that that is what jobidon is doing right here when jobidon says israel is being indiscriminant he is honestly he is doing humiliation to the dead is rally soldiers foare going house to house right now in the gosestrip many of them coming out wounded for life or dead anywhere here is jobidon doing this ridiculous retine the goseter mussorsponsibillity going after mons to toue to pos to mancan andn wons i do not this this entire notion that israel is not attempting to minmi civilian casualties well its own people are being killed is insane it is insane israel's been doing this for thirty years since osla and it is it is the roughest job counter in surgency is the roughest job in the military any military and israel's been doing it for thirty years in getting again it is only eighteen nineteen twenty year old son and daughters killed by going into thse areas specifically in attempt to avoidsvilling casualties then you have this old dottering fulaglebon mindescrunn meanwhile jake sullivan the national security adviser he said that he would carried tobidins concerns about the duration of the conflict when he travelse to israel later this we quote ti will certainly be talk in a prie menicsternitinaho an the war caminet and the senior national secury leadership about time tables bot her the thingg about that the subject of how they are seeing the time taple of this war will certainly be on the agenda for all of my meeting out just lik to point outright here that the white house position when it comes to you crane has been as longas it takes with as much tat takes without any end point knowing that the borer is not going to move in don bas and crimea they ben doing this in nou crane since february of to thouse an twenty two it is now december of twenty twenty three that is fully twenty two months twenty two months of war and the white house sastilic we kyou't sixty more billion dollars for you cranham an obviously man as longas it takes for avli whatever as longas it takes israel has been at war since october seven is curnently december thirteenth an of teing count that is a a little over two months a littlover to months and jiksones when is his think an end already won's it gon end already meanwhile the united statesis not provided anywhere near the level of military aid the united states is provided tou rane not remotely what is the differenth the difference is the left wing presser when it comes to israel is significantly larger then the left wing pressr on it comes t ou crane by the way i jus shuld point out at this point that literally the only reason why the left is supportive of you crane as sopposed to russia he is because of russiageght an twenty sixteen it is the only reason when borako boma was president the left was support of of russia when borakoboma was president he was making onsessions to russia insyria in crimea in the don bas and the entire left was is puten a badguy i do not know mit romeny seems to want the form policy of the nineteen eighties back then in twenty sixteen there is a widespread perception on the left that hillidi clint could not have legitimately just lost the election it had to be russian interferenc and a that point ploom flanmerputtent goes from huro do villain and suddenly the ucrane war is the greatest war that has ever been flought the only war that matters now some blet us been retty consistent flanerputten is a fug russia has been in uligarckic quasi terror response for state for decades really since putten tok over in tearly two thousands nance nannanto thousand some has been fully consistente across the board what is wear to me is how everybody on both sides flippt when brokabamls present the rightwas got russia man they are terrible and then trumple as present and because the left decided that russia was terrible many on the right wellick will may be russia's good now then no russia was always the same puent has notching but what is amazing about this to get back to te israel situation is it the same people horsing no time table an you cran ever no time table keep it going forever those some people are its been two months in israel israel needs to stop i mean international pressure an all o man what or the french goin to thing i dun't know that be supercareful about the polish real o my goshra were really really concerne about what the netherlands is gongto think about all this an it is it is just it is just rediculous meanwhile the media doing the work of commass its is truly incredible how the meda's dedication to the fundamental principle which is that if you are an unsuccessful nation if youare if youare a nation that is rife with terror if youare nation that is rife with the anti americanism somehow ther must be something good about you it is truly amazing an somehow if you are a more powerful nation that has built up its military and has guaranteed writes for its on citizens that somehow youare victimizer an here is a sian an ancher boris sanch has questioning is really spokesman margragave about the number of dad in gaza now again no one has ever done this in a war before a i this was nots undering the iciswar nobodyes i gomy got how many people aregetting killed in the iceis word many people are dying nobody this wosthe in talks about really during the afgan or the arock war but suddenly when israel hast you takean action in order to maintain its own security for the future after the worst terror attack in its history then all the sudenc goll my god this is too many people getting killed does not matter by teway how many f them ar terrace according to sanen here ago on the question a of bitan suggesting that israel is losing global support a does that influence the thinking of the is really government in anywayi think it is become clear given whit the new an security council try to push forward this weekan that the neu as blot that the world is not o ka with the eighteen thousand pluss people that have been reported killed many of them women and children in gaza does this in anyway alter what is real is trying to accomplish or at leas the way that it approachis it is war with commoss well fistibl ouis the strae ace an is the otermati as either abars tis note mati e e isral majargy there at the ani masus and tho we thing a tates we very preciated e that that te to that we had the amer americans to pemeti pretection wese to prechated ter istro an the es as we ne full in this it is crucial that we win this war it is crucial that we de te t comasin doing in paa we have to do everything we can to save god agasoncs to be ins than we have to do everything we can to make they get the ad the they need by the way worth noting right here that again zero people would be dying if comas just surrender commass will not surrender and people will continue to die it really is that' simple meanwhile while the west continues to vascilate and the west continues to pretend that terras are not terrists and that evil people are not evil the hoothies continued to ratch it up all of the problems with shipping throut the mddle east according to the wallstraternal yemons hoothy forces have attack several ommercial ships crossing through the bob elmandub straight in recent days crittng a new front in the battle between israel and hammass tcomplicating efforts by the united states in in allies to secure that critical shipping lane we the rebels claim responsibility on tuesday for strike on the norwegians tanker strinda a day earlier off yemon's coast as the erronian ally escollates attacks to destrupt the flove cargoes in response to fighting in gaza now can ney point out here that western military power compared to hoothy pirates our bunch of ill armed dolts tla why is this even in issue we have just obliterate them if they are in those waters put some ships in the water if the hoothies put up a drone shoot it down and then kill the people who are firing the drone if they put a little boat in the water with bunch of terrace on it blow up the boat what what why are we pretending that this is difficult when it is clearly not particularly difficult isnat amazing amazing thing why and the ans wer is because you would not want a conveye to the erronians that we are militant meanwhile aran is at war with the united states it does not mean that we have to go in and do regime change does not mean that we need to go bom taheron doesn' mean towehave the allies inside the regime thatd be capable of handling the place if we were to bom tatron what it does mean is it is proxy groups our pin pricks compared to the power of western military might and we are letting them hold up shipping and that will cost people money by the way we can pretend that none of this has any real world the fact wat the reality is that the bob elmnd ob straight the place that the hoothes are runing around high jacking ships an and firing things of them that is the roupe by which ten precent of literally all global trade passes the united states ow the western powers that is we blowing the woothes out of the water when they do tat instead there are fussing oh is it really a problem whichshoul we do of this is troublesome you notes more troublesome is when aron starts formenting more and more conflict around the region which by the way is by the west should also be standing against cosballah being in the south of lebanon right now israel is issuing all sorts of warnings tohisballah move move north move about thirty miles north and get the hell off that border because right now you have got our entire country in rock at ranging we are not going to leave it that way the westerd similarly make it clear to lebine's government that tes balan nmeeds to move off that border m eanwhile commasleaters are apparently fleeing cutar the catari government apparently told them that if they stayed that isral might kill them that is at least a apositive no hopefully israel will killed them because at there some of the world's most evil human beings apparently they left for an unknown at destination they turned off their phones they are not exceptin calls now apparently a senior member of commas also left his usual residence in berout for turkey comasis much on the run from aside that theyn o leaving countries that ta they feel arevulnitable in favor of presumably aron and turkey singo which a turkish law maker yesterday a he was preaching against israel and he started screaming about how israel will not be able to escape the wrath of god and then things went wrong for him etes thes tee o not loe othes teeo no ete ody no o no loethe thing the truth will not be silent if only you could be save rom the torments of history al canni e saved from the wrath of alah som it israel salutations to a hart attack down he is in serious condition i just toppoint out that the turkish government is one of the leading terresponsors in the middle east well being a nato member ganti lat the the uselesslesstovate of nato stoptokn mat yucrane sar tung a turkey which is indeed a disaster area of a country meanwhile jobidon is continuing to have all sorts of trouble on the economy the new inflation report is out and it is not particularly good according to brightbart the inflation report released tuesday as unlikely to do much to support the idea that byd nomics has been boon for the american economy the consumer price indects climbed i zeropoint one per cent on a monthly basis an acceleration from being flat in october the annual increases at three point one per cent now remember we are supposed to be seeking a two per cent rate of increase three looks good when compared what was ten but stillotks really bad when compared t two is fully fifty per cents off the number thatyouare looking for bidn supporters o mending the establishment financial media our saying that this is well below nine per cent but im letthus point out that in flation fell to three point one per cent anualized in june and then spent the next for months rising again and now is back at three pont one per cent and it is all baked intoth cake it is not as though an inflation the rate of inflation goes to three per cent that means that the prices are going back down theyare not they are going up theyare just going up slower this is why jobin remains an unpopular president sem crag center a shar brown i i love that he continues to promote the idea that inflation is a result of corporate of corporate evil or something a suppose o shooting money into the american economulicors strip club here is shard brown doing his retin john stand ot to th me tack he at tresthe knows what that does to frut prices and he knows what it does to farmers wagers and the same that i stand up the wall strk on stand up to trug copes and voters voters do not carryor party if you'r standing up for anatra scrup om that that screwn over people an when when on peopl ll go to the grocery store a the're brinkly their pang when their their grocer prices go up because their pang for exacutabonises and its stock bybacs and that is pretty clear and voters voters understand that when you talk about the ine well i mean acty voters are not going to blame inflation on corporabibacs that that is a dog that is not going to hunt by any stretch of the imagination as he actios notes over alsey pad rose is your opoint one present novmember as dropping gasoline price s dragged the over all indecks down but while the headline dress steadily lower the cuarp measure is stock beneath the surface by soe measures is pushing higher the index rose at a three point four per cent annualized pace over the past three months as recently as ogust to as two point four per cent by that measure again the at the idea that that the fed is about ready to lower the intrestrats again that obviously is untrue and democrats are looking for somebody to blame for their own failures here is janit yellin who has been a terrible treasury secretary blameing covid for the continuing inflation and the stagnating economy why do you think there is this tis connect and are you concerned about the fact the the administrations mesterter an by te nomic is not landing i think we have we have been through a lot everybodyis te pantemic cause enormous omoun to distruption in peoples lives and on we are still in the after mat of whats beena serious shock and we had serious global shots and oll their price is to riseing at a much slower pace than they were in flation is substantially ofte ties the livel prices of somethings that people bi and are important to them are higher everything is going amazing according gant yellin in except for the votes which are not going amazing for jobidon he is in serious electoral trouble ardyfolks in just one second we will be getting to the latest in the twenty

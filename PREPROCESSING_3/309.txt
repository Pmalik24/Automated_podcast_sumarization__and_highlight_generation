welcome to the hubermanacontance of science science ace to for i menjer hubermen and on ur professor of nerobiology and optomology at stamford school of medison my gues to day is doctor and professor markdes bozito doctor markdes bozito is a neurologist and a professor of neuro science and psychology at the university ove california berkly he is a world expert in the brain mechanisms controlling executive function and memory executive function is the way in which we are able to designate and carry out specific cognitive strategies and it is fundamental to every aspect of our daily lives and because much of being effective in daily life involves using specific context relevant batches of information in order to understand what to do and when and what not to do and when and to come up with strategies that are very adaptive for us to move forward in the context of relationships work school and athletics and on and on there is really no separation between executive function and memory and to day doctor desbozito explains the neral circuits controlling executive function and memory how they interact the key role of dopomine in executive function and something called working memory and teaches us ways to optimize executive function and memory that is how to optimize cognitive fnction in addition to discussing how to optimize cognive function in the healthy brain today's discussion also centers around how to restore cognive function in disease or injury conditions that deplete executve function and memory such as trematic brain injury concussion alsheimers parkinsons and attention defisite disorders doctor despozito shares with us research findings both about behavioral informicologic strategies to enhance executive function and memory by the end of to day's discussion you will have learned from doctor des bozito a tremendous amount about the modern understanding of cognition that is thinking and memory and the carrying out of specific cognive strategies you will also learn a tremendous amount about how to optimize brain function and brain health before we begin id to emphasize at this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desiron effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme id to think the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is mawe newe venison now we knew evenison is the most neutriant dense and delicious red meat available have spoken before on this podcast and there is general consensis that most people should strive to consume approximately one gram of protine perpound of bodyweight now when one strives to do that it is important to maximize the quality oe that proting an take to the calory ratio because you do not want to consume an excess of calories when trying to get that one gram of protine perpound of bodyweight now we knew evenison has an extremely high quality proting to calory ratio it makes getting that one gram of p rotine propound a bodyweight extremely easy it is also delicious personally i the ground venise and ile the venison stakes and then for convenience when 'm on the road i the jerkey the jerkey is a very high protine to calory ratio it has as much as ten grams of protine purr jerky stick and has something only fifty five calories again making a very easy to get enough protine without consuming excess calories if you would to try mawenewe venison can go to mawe newe venison dock calm slash huberman to get twenty per cent off your first order again that is mawenee venison doc calm slash huberman to get twenty per cent off to day's episode is also brought to us by ju juve makes medical grade red light theropy devices now there is one thing i've consistently emphasize on this podcast is the incredible roll that light can have on our biology of course i'm always telling people that they should get sunlight in their eyes as soon as possible after waking on as many days of their life as possible for sake of setting cercanin rhythm daytime moodfokus an alertness and improve sleep now in addition to sunlight red light and nerin fred light has been shown to have possive effects on improving numerous aspects of cellar and organ health including faster muscle recovery improved skin health and wound healing even improvements in acney or that is removal of acney reducing pain and inflammation improving myt a conjural function and even improving vision itself what sets juve apart and why it is my preferred red light therapy device is that it has clinically proving wavelings meaning it uses specific wavelengths of red light and ner im pred light incombination that trigger the optimal cellar adaptations personally i use the hand held juve every day the henhel juv is about the size of a thick piece of toast and i also own a juve panel that allows for full body exposure and i use that one approximalely five times per weep for about ten to fifteen minutes purcession if you would to try juve you can go to juve doc alm slash huberman to receive fifty dollars off your first purchase again that is juve spell je oh o vv doc calm slash huberman to get fifty dollars off your first purchas to day's episode is also brought to us by eight sleep eight sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity ov spoken many times before in this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance now a key component of getting a great night sleep is that in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actualy has to increase by about one to three degrees one of the best ways to make sure that those temperature changes accurr at the appropriate times at the beginning and throughout and at the end of your night when you wake up is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that is what eight sleep allows you to do it allows you to progrin the temperature of your mattress and sleeping environment such that you fall and stay deeply asleep easily and wake up each morning feeling incredibly refreshed and energist i've been sleeping on an eight sleep mattress cover for al ost three years now and it has dramatically improve the quality of my sleep if you would to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep dok calm slsh hubermen to get a hundred fifty dollars off their pod three mattress cover eight sleep currently ships ind the ou ess a candida ou k select countries in the u and australia again that is eight sleep dok calm slash hubermen and now for my discussion with doctor marked desposito doctor desposito welcome i andyour thank you much froviding me really look can forward our conversation you may not remember me but i remember you when i was a first year graduates to and a you showed up it berkeley one of the first people to really bring functional imaging of the human brain to berkley bring a neurology and a clinical emphasis to the nursint studies there in its really just a blossomed and it is been a real thrill for me to see all the magnificent work out of your laboratory over the years and i know you also still see patient the topics that are of interest to you i know of great interest to our audience ou wo just start off with a few of the basics and im do little functional nerr anadomy lesson for folks not to scare any one do not worry this will be accessible t everyone and just talk about the fronta loabes and prefront of quartax and a a bit of what those structures do because many times on this pod cassaps at oke the neurl real estate right behind your forehead is involved in contects and planning at cetera but you are the real expert here am how shoull we think about what the front o loabes do and and their veryus rolls in health and disease yes theres for loabes this affrontoloaves pride al tonpral excepat al and the frontaoloaves pry take up more do take up more territory than a tos pry about a third of of the qartex and within the front to loabes iii do not i'm get to use sir fronto loaves fry in our conpresentiona lapa what i really mean as the prefront of uartex within the fronto loaves there is also mot areas at pornt for motor function as well a but more talk about the frontolove te tonk about its you known balman higher level tolking a bill is reall talki about the prefrontal qartax and this is what is considered sir the highest level of qartex in the brain ye when you think it when you think about ot people a sign it all sorts of functions almost every function think of people sor put into the fronto lves but i think what we have all conconnic a move towards us this idea of executive function this abilt this ability tos to plan to organize a to really trance for our thoughts into an action and really to be guided by goals and and intentions and not be kind of take in a kind of ruled by sort of just automatic behaviors d a word we use in cogner scienceis call cognav control co mantrol executive functions what we attribute to the front toloe and you can think of it as the seat el of the brain or the i yunore the conductor of the archist are really the part of the brain that is that is really controlling the the the rest of the brain yet you have to choose which part you wanted not leave home thit is your front is your frontalopes speaking of which a what ar some of the a symptoms of mild fronta lobe damage an severe front o lobe damage a damage brought about either through a nerge gener of disease or physical injury i kn organ to talk a bit about both to day or a lot about both but how would lack of executive function a show up maybe on inkint of a subtle level ye i mean at first ic sould say that it shows up all the time because when when and in front a low behaviouris probably much more prevalent than than we realize certainly we think about it when you have a brain injury to the frontolovs and there is lots of nerological disorders stroke can termacbrane ry nowcimersthes that can affect in frontolope and there is a number of feno psychiatric disorders subsessive combulsive disorder and kets of frendy and depression that ar thought to be frontolope is function but when your sleep deprived and when your stress and just normal aging the frontaloves seems to be the first system that is affected because it really is involop in the highest level when we are having a bad day when we are having difficult the sort of setting priorties om e're having difficulties achieving the goal that we have set out when we get distract when we get distracted u when we are not able to serve a daft and beflexible these are all the type of things tat ar reflect that our frontoloves are not functioning obtimately approximately what age does the fronto lobe circuitry a come on line to speak mean when i see a baby a babies can orient their eyes towards things but they are rather reflective in in where they will place their eyes but by time kids or three or four they con certainly play with blocks or intracted with other children or their parents but it seems that ben full functionality the frontaloves is is really gradual at least that is my non clinically traind to sessiment ye i mean thit is a really tough question to know when they are fully developed because these studies haven done when emor i was introduce somewhe're able to sor image the brain in a nonavase of way a than studies its tart to come out trying to suremap out at what age does your frontoloves fully develop and it seem it was early into your your twenties iyou know always say that it is not surprising that you cannot rent to car an to your twenty five at the ansurance companies knew before nour scientist it is to when your frontoloves have when youre decision making skills at their highests and that is probably bout right and to your twenties is prolly before your front loves of fully developed and it is really interesting question is what why does it takes long it is the area of the brain that takes the longest to develop and why is that and i think there is a reason i think hat t this sort of slow developed of frontaloves allows us to to explorer allows us to think ab ot novel ways of solvin problems allows us to take in the world if they were shut off earlier ah it woul would lead to ma be much more sort of rigid kind of less flexible kind of a behavior thatthat woud seem think i i think that that it helps to be i take a long time to develop but also it obviously leads to some problems sometimes inadolescences s as we see sometimes can one see a lack of front o low maturity in just the sheer number of physical movements that a child makes am for instance in a class room of i that say fourth graters often times they will be a range of u apparent of ability of kids to sit still or to listen do we think that the kid that is having a hard time focussing and listening to instructions or steadying their body when they are told to sit still i now if they still tell consist said i kheoll but the would tell me a sit still i i was a kid am is that am somehow reflective of a slightly lagging front of frontoloe function and maturity whereas that that the kids thet consit still in stoi con focus does that mean that they are low bit more accelerated along that trajectory yet's hard to say i mean the frontelobe is big as a big territory and we can get into it but there is the ront lo probably has twenty five difference sob regions within it and and grossly we think about the frontelobes as the lattal portion of the front telobes of which is involved in these executive function probly supports these execive functabilities but then we have got another part ofthe front eoves called the ormal frontal cortex was prolly valle more in social and emotional behavior when we think again when we think about front allo behaviors a they cant you have to break there is many different type offront al behavor that tige behavor which may be voved ince or being able to inhibit your motor movements or maybe not being distracted may reflect that that system is a little bit delayed but it could be that another system the one that is involved in planning and organizes you knowis more developed than i di i do think they they develop at different tradectories wih the fronta loaves essentially am serving an executive or see o tight function gol directed behavior intentions cognaive control on these are the terms you used u where are the rules what do the rules look and i think about brain function ors ave spent one my life thinking about think about chemical an electrical signalling between nerans different erons communicating more or less at a given moment reflecting some sort of circuit as we call it and then some behavior or some decision comes out and if i for instance u i to get my driver's licence renewed sence if i go to the department of motor vehicles what a lovely experience that is a the moment i get there tat i isfor lock him to a certain rule set when i'm home i'm in a different rule set when i'm in my friends verses whent im with my parents a different rule sets and seems at the front o lo is really good it drawing on context base on knowledge of where one is and then coming up with conave algarithms that are appropriate or inappropriate to run in that context but what is the nature of these algarithms are they of the o kay shut down all cursing in this environment o qet youre freetod just quoting be you i mean when e realy comes down to it ihas some interesting philosophical aspects too because i just be yourself be authen tiy be vulnerable you'all these things i make sense but of course one needs to be appropriate with the context o this work what what is the what are the algarithms how howos his work ig because ecause that is a pretty common example of our patience that they they do not follow te rules m they they if you are sitting in a some one' ought the doctor's office and the phoned rings not to pick up his phone but the patients do not and that they may pick up the phone theres theres is a dotor lomeat who is a a noroligis from france publish these beautiful papers in the aities of all these things that patience did that just that broke the rules and and soand bring just kind of pull to the their environment without having any contexts to it if he put a pair of glasses on the table and did not ask him to put hem n they would put hem on even if they had a pair glasses on a ready or he took em to their apartment than they saw the bed and they jump into h bed and go on to the covers ir he saw he had a nurse and she he put a blood pressure coff there and she picked up the blood pressure coffin just start taking his blood pressure gand not asking em to do any these things and they they they just do not follow sort of the social rules but they are there they they have not lost rules if you ask these patience was that the appropriate thing to do they will say no no they know it they not they know its appropriate yet they shay know i'm not supposed to answer your phone but o o they know better but they cannot control the imexactly soas it is it is yo is not a break down at the rules disappear is that they cannot apply the rule that they cannot apply the rules prought properly andn nd that is true for a lot of ppatience eeven with kids you tell them i do not have anything to eat before dinner because for having dinner and then theyr sitting theire having a sanways and you say what it i just tell you you said whall do not eat but im i'm hungry right a sir anothers for examples or the frontloves not completely cant of developed when i think about rules i i think about the brain the brain processes information obviously but it also store s information the most important thing it does his store all sortes of informatien all over the brain and i think what the front al loves do as they store rules and what is interesting about the way it' stores rules they seem to store the rules in a higharchical fa asson and what i mean by that is that there is different levels to rules i i to give the examplel of a playing golf i tell story a lot about my good ferend bob night when hits a ball into the you knw off into the woods and he has to try and hit the ball out of the woods he is holding on to all different levels of rules on how a successfully get his ball back towards the green the themost simplest one is just where in a where is the flat i've got o maintained a a orintatien to get to the flack hes holdin that he also hat a higher level rules he knows that if he kicks the ball it is a penalty he is not an a do that rightin then an another higher level rule might be if i just keep doing this that this is can be healthy for me hes storing all this information at sort of a different leves of hire and he supplontes r applying it to ultimately achieve this very simple act of not simple act of of ing the offall yes i just i think about sor the front al cort dics is able to call upon the rule in the appropriate contacts and if you do not have your front to loves it it it does not get pulled up properly and those rules must be learned right that it there is no way i can imagine that one can be born into the world with these rules sets an i think abut the the two marshamal experiment that is or famous now were kids are offered to eat a one marshamaua right away or differ and get two marshamaloshes a adorable vidio ily reistragedies they use turning away and poking the marshamellow and there is a some debate on going as to whether not a success wer lack of success in deffering to the two marshamaul reward is am predictive of of other things in life but leaving that aside u ami correct in assuming that that task is a frontal lob task the kids are given a novel rule you nave one marshana a now or wait patiently and then a with and overcome the craving for that one marshama an then you will get too presumably that that experiment is engaging the frontal loabes and wee can only speculate but some kids are able to defer some or not and i can imagine that at that age there is a lot of neuroplasticity am strengthening and weakening of connections is in the brain on in an experienced dependent way does that mean that children and perhaps adults as well can train up there prefrontal cort cortical abilities to stratagise and defer ing a way that is adaptiv absolutely i mean definilly you can learn tragee's to not only sort of learn rules but but how to apply goalls ben when you start to think about that task and particular some of it has to do what sort of maintaining a goal and and maintaining a goal at different time scales right and children tend to e sort of act on goals that are much more short on a shorter time scall an i'm gan have the salone right now because i'm hungry i suppose to wait il till dinner which is a longer longer term goal and ye have this default a sort of the short you can you can learn that maintaining a longer type goal i it can be much more beneficial i then then the short term gull even though it does not seem obvious and we all learn that right was we it as we get alonger of us we keep or iy on the ball or mor long term goals and that is very predictive of ou successful we can we can be the farther out we can maintain at callon that is what the that is what the prefront of cortex does it maintains goals and than applies those goals and if you do not apply im then you loe then then all of this executive function breaks down do you think that these algarithms and rules that the prefrontal quartical circuitry can learn and indeed does learn can generalize for instance when i my first year of college was the disaster a for reasons that aren'an interesting right now but then when i came back mysoffmore year really spring of my freshrmen years ocay its on it was had the rescue myself and one of thingsthey as to do as i would study and i would set a timer i refuse to get up even if i a use the the rest r in ver very very badly i would i'm set up all sorts of behavioural constraints and i to think that i was building up my prefrontole ability refocus on the material and fortunately for me there were no smart fones ni then much easer i internet now we had get ol but no no nall internet browsing to to speak of and i to think that the i sometimes call it a and this is terrible bam to call this because it is not a nearly exhaustive of the underling function by callt sort limbic friction it is theire's this friction that one feels mentally you want it get up you when heas the rest rme hen eats something hone o call a friend but you stay focust on the task in hand do you think that that business of coting stain focust on the task at hand can generalize because of the sensations it generates in the body and then you owe that that tis is familiar this is just studying but in a different context ye one is one seays focus wore do you think that the prefrontal quartexes it is context specific that it needs to learn a rule the rules for every individual situation and than this has all sorts of implications for behaviour restrained and focus and attention defis it a if you could jus speculate uam a that knowin yet when aist id in how they can be more focust and people often defert you what supplement what drug ocet that those are interesting conversations but i think ultimately were talkin about neral circuitry yet i mean it absoluteley can generalize tit that is been a frustring thing and de trying to devalop what we call cogniterapy where we we teach we try and prove some one's memoryability we try and prove son's executive functionability that the disappointing early results was always that ye they get very good at the task that you train them at but it does not seem to jernalize that anything ouse if you teach hem a a task they can do amazing things match o finger to colors or shape and put together all sorts of rules and then and the're really good at that tasts very quickly and thend nothings really changed in ther real life but but i think we have learned in how a sort of and how to tryand make it a translate to real life and and for example there is there is a therabe called gol man had been training which is developed a by bryin levining collegs at the rotman researchens to toranta where they have been very successful in teaching a patience i do not aprove your executive functiond aand how to make that translate into real world but it is it is very hard work its it is very therapis driven it it requires im it requires a series of o trainings for example people learne a they develop individual projects planning a meal or planning a family vacationd planning up hod gasan than they work through what is involved in that sor o very specific project how you how you stay focus how you do not just get distracted how you you keep your ey in the ball how you break it down to subgulls how you im you mot to what you are doing how you do not let anxieting porascination gan vall but it is a it is a very act of sor process but when you add all that to it and a very discipline way over te course of many hours many weeks it does translate patience and individuals to say ye i'm just better doing things i mean the whole gulls to do things triet and and i'm just better at it i do not know what it is but i'm i'm not just better at what you taught ma am just betterate at other things i do have a lot of hope that these kind of therapece bill generalize to the rena to people's real life i throughout the term limbic friction again not a technical or clinical or official term in anyway but just a waiy to and a captured some of the interactions of the front of quarte with other circuitry i'min thes far mor involved in agitation and challenges focussing than the limbic system but its it certainly is involved when thinking about the frontaf quartex i often think about it is connections with other areas of the brains wo may be we coul talk a little bit about those connections and and in particular the connections from the front al quartex to what is call it am circuitry that controls reflective behaviors what are what is the nature of that circuitry and can we make any general statements does the frontal quartex really serve to provided quieting suppressive function on refleces or is it more of an orcustor a conductor where it saying looka little bit of that loman o that and then what is what comes out in behavior or speech is something that looks very organized but it is actually the the the reflection of the lot of selective filtering yes i mean the prefenal quartex what fastening about is that it i would say it connects that every part of the brain a qartax and the sub quartax and almost every part of the brain connects to it o that i mean that right there tells you it is a pretty importance ery and id it has to if it is going to be in this o conductor ti experience a roll and it is in this privileged position just anatomically that that cas as great inside to how important it is and it is connecting and then of course we coul talk about it how it is connected to the body as well how i control is hartragt and respirations as well s notchess this the brains a but it is really interesting you said is is it really just sort of maintaining telling you what is relevant and what is not relevant ors an allowing you to switch i think it does all those things iit definally what we call sense these top down signals it is sending signals to othe brain about what you should be payin attention to an what you should not be a ppay an attention to for example if you we have done studies with functional imaging where we have them look at pictures of faces and scenes and that lights up the back of your brain your visual qartex as areas at er can process faces and process scenes and om but sometimes we have you just one pay attention to the faces and not the scenes and other times we want you to pay attentionto the scenes and not the faces well you do not even though it is getting the same bottom up visual in put the prefrontal quartex will show greater activity to the relevant information it it will it will sor it is sending a signal say pay attention the faces it ignore the scenes and a or vice aversa it is it is directing all of this information tat ewarted with to what is what is relevant but at the same time it is also a sallowing us to switch if if that we now have to go switch to another task its sas of ca this as not in portant now ore gang to move over to this this other other task there is many different components of how i can how i can kind of control behavour but it does all of these things in this incredible way that we tiod dont completely understand what we know that is the source of of all f this control is coming from the prefrom the qartex i'd to take a brief moment and think one of our sponsers and that is ag one ag one is a vitemen mineral probiotic drink that also contains adoptigons i starty taking ag one away back in two thousand and twelve the reason i starty taking it n the reason i still take it every day is that it insures that i meen all of my quotas for vitemens and minerals and it insures that i get enough prebotic and probiotic to support got health now god health is something that over the last ten years we realized is not just important for the health of our got but also for our mune system and for the production of naurow transmitters and auromodulators hings dopaming in ser atonent in other words god health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course i strive to consume healthy whole foods for the majority of mynutritional wentake every single day but there are number of things in ag one including specific micro netrans that are hard to get from whole foods ore at least in sufficient quantities ag one allows me to get the vitemens and minerals that i need probiotic preboatics the adaptigens and critical micrornutriencs any time somebody asks me if they were to take just one supplement what that supplement should be i tell them ag one because ag one support many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try ag one go to drink g one dotcam slash humerman and you will get a your supply a viteman d three k two and five free travel packs of ag one again that is a drink ag one docalm slash huberment you mention connections between the prefrontal qartex in the body u that is the first i've heard of that and i'm not challenging that ato the contrary i'm just intrigued by it m i'm aware that the hi pofalmess and some these deeper braine structures associated with more what is call the primitive drives temperature regulation a hunger et cetera connect to the body but a whatr what is the nature of some of the connections with the faruls to the o yas just or talking terms of of our knowledge of how young changing i i wanted your pates to talk abou ti as to the prefrontal quartexs and slow heartwrights i meant in that in that rotway got it at that that yet bi bi tha by influence and a cortical function will obviously we can influence a a organs the got it through some intermediate stations yes ye i mea it is not to not to be hyperobolic but seems the freefrontal quartex what here ere referring to as the fronta loaves are essentially the seat of what makes us human and what makes us functional or disfunctional in a given context it i m ah i recall there is a cyndrum cloveerbucy cyndrum which has some vague a similarities to how you describe frontal cart tamage but there i as i re call humans or animals with that cyndrum will act in a way that is not appropriate to context but more inappropriate thell they will try and eat a a suramac cop or draw with a piece of paper which obviously will not work it seems with the frontal quartex it knows that a pen is for writing it just the person might say i know not speca write this but i'm just in or write with it but i when o take your pen and write something inappropriate with it but it is not that the the people forget that there is that it is a pen it seems it is drawing on rule sets but that somethings intact it is that it is not cloveer bucy syndrum were animal some people can tryin a mate with inanamit are objex u which is one of the more salien sometimes i'll never forget that gerum from my cogn nurs ience course which yo y the way to throw that in there ye si hhow shal we thing about this and heremchin an get at a kind of a broader understanding a brain function and contex specific behavior it fronta quartex is supersipistic ated but it does not have all the information seems some one without a front or quartects probably knows that you write with a pen you do not write with a piece of paper ye i i think it is we think about it as it is the frontocort as allows us to take thought and move it towards action and there is this disconnect between the the knowledge and an action and this separation of action from knowledge and i gess i can reflect on my patience when i i've seen a lot of patience with damage all over the brain and all the families of patience who have fronta of injury always say the same thing ther they are just no longer that person they are no longer my spause are no longer my best friend and no longer my father tos something they cannot put it into words but they are not them any more there is something has changed whereas if you talked of patien with brokas of phasia whose has this inability to speak they cannot get any words out now this is a devastating problem there' still the same person they they they their personality hasn'n change they they feel the same person they just cannot speak the way they get around in the world is different or if you take a patient with prosepic knows it which is a this inability to recognize faces of course the way they navigate around the world is is is difficult and it is not the same but there is still the same person there is something really special about the frontal cartax that allows us to be as you said sir of who we are and that is the difficult part how does the frontelopes allow us or take a take who we are intranslate that into noled we are not i guess another worse saying it just just having knowledge is in what makes us who we are right at this to be able to take that knowledge and and and presented in a way that allows us to live life bases on our intentions and our goals and our desires much of things stoic philosophy and and even onlying well miss culture are bout having routines you o overcoming reflects by just having recipes scrips to follow each day i certainly try to have my mournings be as what i call liner as possible and i find it is much easier in the earlier part of the day to just decide hears what im to do wriht out o lis do things in a certain sequince if i do not do that i go non lineer as i refer to it well get distracted and things that sort but earlier you mention sleep deprovation can impair front a low function it does seem that as the daye progresses and certainly in the middle the night it jus becomes much harder to control are are thinking maybe even our behavior but and certainly our emotions is there a fronta lod a regulation of emotional states as well i know you have some recent work on this lovedie ye i mean as i was saying earlier the frontaloves as a big place and and half of it is invowed an these high level executive functions but the other half of it is in is a part up the lymic system or that we call the parelemic issem that is involved an socional and emotional behavior and a there is this intimate back and forth between these two areas of the qartexs if you have just damage to these frontul to these areas that are condn in the fronta lobe you will have many different in parments that are we would call sir social or emotional apparents and their executive function will be quite normal and then you will have the the opposite where patients with the latle damageal have executive functions but they seem emotionally antact but but you kdo not in youreal life when we have both these antact their their communicating with each other riht emotion in contacts and is goingto influence are executive function we make bad decisions in strestsful situations are sistuations were not comfortable with its it is where we might make a better decision if it is a quiet yow kind o come quiet place u but it is something that we can i think youre right you can you can sort of get into routine and learn how to do things if you have very much plan toaw but whats unique about us ou we can be flexible on a dathabll right when when something novel comes oper there is something i something unexpected comes up we can adapt to it and that is really what the front of cortex is really importanimpor im not just sort of making these plans routines and senting all the rules with being abu when things do not go right ha ta how to write the shap right i will never ask you to demonize technology i certainly use a a smartphone from waking till sleep generally not in the middle the night if i can avoid it a and i generally avoid it but am trying to take what we'v discussed this far and superimpose the the notion of smart phones and ask what are the rules what are the algaritms that were learning when we use these devices and i'm not calling them adapt ive wore maledapt if the're clearly here to stay they have assisted in medicine i'm sure it makes it easier for doctors to communicate on the on the ward an and for clinic and ar it but useful it but contained in the small device there are things u for instance text messaging where unlike twenty years ago we can have four or five different conversations very quickly while boarding a flight there is a tasks whiching element that was just not present in ar life prior to that social medium particular this notion of being able to scroll move if we really step back from this move one's thumb an access hundreds if not thousands of vidio content from diswhich each of which has a distinct context and have to imagine that kids indadults have frontal cortesies that a learning these rules and the rule is move your thumbs stay engaged emotions either positive ailence emotions or negative emotions and me it is it is a fairly limited landscape there when you really think about it but but the algarithm that is learned is to me does not seem explortable it does not help me prepare for a podcast at all i know that for short does not help me go for a run does not help me listen with more focused attention to a family member were a friend or significant other it may make me more impathich or more angry i we can we can speculate but again with no with no intention of demonizing social media it does it seem that that the algarithms that are being run in our brain men are they neutral re they positive are they negative shoall we be worried it does not seem lake they translate to much else they whi cannot see a way in which they help us be better people in other domains where as reading a book line by line and then going back o i did not even remember anything from that page going back line by line pling i game a squash or somethinglike that there i can see the real value of the rule sets that generalize ye i mand i can just historically i corrupt in world when there was no smarphones as a residenc and and one of the most difficult things i do in practices have to take care patience in emergency room and there is a real emergency one's having cond control seisars or there having a stroke and doing this back in the aidies or nineties and early two thousand when you went down there and you did not hav any smart phone you you culd only rely on what is what is in your heade and i coul say now having the smart phone it has not it does not help me at all i i never u know does not help me at all in making the kind of decisions that i have to make in emergeure i'm i'm trying to side what what what is the problem here what is the differential diagnosis what how should i treated i'm just trying to make very going through an algrown you said in a common sense wayand there is nothing on my phone that i can turn to to help me do that it has helped with giving me knowledge back in the day i to remember what the di land an dose was and have that in my head or go look for the piece of paper my pocket and i can quickly pull up you knwi gif i'm a little bit there is information that i can access i do not have to worry about keeping every single dose in my head or keeping everything my head just facts in my head but aoutside of that there is nothing i can turn to that it is it is making me better making me make better decisions s i i do not even need myself phone i do not go searching u for myself pone if i'm going to go to meris o remorigan to take a take a phoncl i do not see how it is helping sor make your front th lok it cannot be your front to loves i mean this another way of saying it but but ion the flipside can it help you optomize front to love function technologies certainly it can we can maybe talk about later there are discertainly thit that is one way to get learned strategisus through a through a device that that is easily accessible and you kow to you as supposa book or or i ing a therapist the in your house i suppose i worry that am too much of my time and other people's time and especially young people's time is am engaging in a algarithm that does not generalize for adaptiv behaviour elsewhere and and by comparison youknow a the game o salker with friends or something i it is social social media social am it is physical socil medyais not physical but will will rule that that portion out but there is a rule set ere's goll directed behaviour am presumably some of the things that happen in a game a salker with friends translate to some other domain of life am because it is a single context game of salker wheres tha social media i do not know anybody that goes and looks at one account and that is it and absorbs the informationd may be comments has an interaction and goes it is it is hundreds or thousands of context is there any risk or perhaps benefit to being able to am get this very a detailed portal into many contexts preunit time nd that the forbings never had done that in the course of human history as far as i know ye i may i think there is a risk but wat pops to mine n your having kids is is watching them navigate in their cars to place is totally dependent on angogal maps and i thi you are pry old enough to remember real maps that were you does asoaelemaps i were you had to really figure hat you you had to go to a certain place and you had theither look at the map or or or as sopit agasays on ast of thes this these skills were something that you learned and you developed and it was problem solving and and a and that is all gone now i mean that it is it is i i wonder even if sometimes if if a people even know the direction there going whether it is was northor what set down ther end because there just following the direction i we will see i i just cannot imagine that that learned skill as nock and o be detrimental to us at it is some point in generalizein the peverse generalize an a bad way right and as as sopposed to a good way am i do not ya it does it does deptfually worry me but you said there is nothing on the phone that helps you plan a pot gast nomething that helps me in the emerged rom nothing elpse a professor hen he is giving a lecture i agree with you that the sort of having your head buried in in a selphone i'm not yet iit is i do not see tho being healthy for your front oloves let us talk about working memory am soe years back but still now you use working memory tasks in experiments in your laboratory few would am be kind as to explain what working memory is and then i love to talk about some of the work you have done exploring the rule of dope of men in working memory am because this is critical to every day life and i kno dopemeins to bit of a buzz word these days but i'm the listeners tof this podcast anyway or ar pretty sophisticated in terms of knowing that dopaming is not just about reward it is about motivation and gold directed behavior and i think dopamng intrigues for a good reason that it does govern a lot of our quality of life to im what is working memory yet i mean working memory it sincrting a start studying it about thirty years ago and i do not think i realize how important it was when i started but what we mean by working memoryes is ability to hold information in mind i when it is no longer accessible to us if you tell me you are telephone number and i'm after put it into my phone you kow it is no longer there you just told me but i'll hold it in min working memory until i can punch it into my my phone it does not have to be something that comes from th outside world i could hold up a you knowi i can pull up my own if i'm filling out o form and i want to pull up my sulf security number i can hold that in mind to until i put it down i'm when you think about it it it is a very important tus ability that we have that we do very follously and what i've learnd more about working memory is is the working part of it t it is not just as passive holding information of mine whut it is being able to do things with the information it is being able to im it when we when we do a bath problem which we do not do that much now that we have calculated if you do that in you are head you are able to sor manipulate the information an and do the different parts of the problem or even if you are you are trying to find someone in a crowd and you are holding on to some face you are able to hold that fase in mind and cross check it and search and and there is there is operations to working memory is not just ou knows not just this passive maintenance when we start to think about working memory in that way we start to realize how importit is for it is ou not think ofit as the foundation for for cognition it just think about reading comprehension you cannot understand this conversation if you cannot hold in mind what is going on earlier in in the conversation or when youre reading a book you rememorying the sentence i befor it it it just predicts all these abilities that that allows us to to read to to a plan to organize in all the sort of executive functions that were we are doing right we have to hold in mine rules we have to hold in mine goals we have to hold in mind all of these things in order to carry out behavior im sus is it is it is really come a long way and and terms about people are thinking about it i i know that a mo walker said that ou now sleep is our superpower but i guess one way to sor of use his term while we are awake working memory is is really our superpower wes i it allows us to to translate as we said sir of our knowledge into action by holding this information a and mind as were thinking about what we want to do if we are going to think about dopaming in the contects of working memory is dopaming an accelerator on working memory is it a facilitator what is dopamin doing for w orking memory and may we coun talk a lobit about the circuitry a i've talked abyut dopen men before on this podgast but there is a good chance that some ofthe people listening to this havent heard those episodes may we could just quickly review the three majors circuits for dopeming in the one thit is relevant for working memory ye bet let me star wit the working memory the circuitry for working memory because whan't wont of it important things about working memory is the other type of memory is as long tor memoryies is you you can working memory short lived it is only as long as you are able to rehearse it and then it disappears whereis what we call lung tor memory if i it you remembering what you had for breakfast or you'r vacation this is information that is ts consolidated and and gets put into a a more durable form that we call long to memory and the interesting thing about memory is that these are separate systems everything from working memory just as in pass into long to memory there theyre to completely different systems and and too completely different parts of the brain that seem to control it a working memory a the front of cortec seems to be very importantd for working memory when when we are holding information and line the nurons the brain sells in the frontoloves ore active and they stay kind of active as long as we are holding on that information and they are more active when the information is relevant a and if we a we we get distracted dey'll get less active kind of the fronta lops kon atract your a you notract the memory that you are tolding in mind another important thing about the circuitry is that i if wore holding in mine say didgits tense the phone number well that informations in your back of the brain and the the fronta loes is sor keeping information in the back of the brain active because it is connected to the visual areas it is it is able to sur keep that information active and what we have learned is that there is not these buffers in the brain whereyou know if youre holding ferbal information its in this little bufferin if youre holding visual informations in another buffer the whole brain acts as a buffer and and the fronta love can call up any part of the brain and and keep that part of the brain active as it is as it is opyou know as it is trying to hold this information in line the mechanism for working memoryes just this persistent neral activity within the fronto loves and then the questionis what is do not mean do well do not mean is one of the normodulators that are made in the brainstem and it projects up the different parts of the brain there is a system that goes up into the into the what we call the basile gangla which is born for motor function and thite's another dopen reistan that goes up to the frontoloves and what was discovered was that if you deplete do not mean a working memory drops you get of significant inpairmen working memory if yif you doplet do not mean and if you replace it ah than your working memory will be inproved and do not means seems to be a modulator to help this persistent activity state persistent a uduring the time that you need to ke this information in mind in my reaching too far to drawn analogy between dope means roll in working memory that is to keep information on line and the other established roll of dopamin which is for movement for the generation of smooth movement im as evidence by conditions parkinsons where people lackdopamanurgin ner ons or have damage o doft benmenurging nurons and have i challenges in generating smooth movement what i'm essentially asking is can we think of dopamin as facilitating physical movement through one circuit but also and of mental movement thought movement and a i think o for those i just listening in and not watching im cano rubbing my index in mintale finger against my thumb sa just keeping something on line im it sort of movement of thought or information and then you han chuck it away and bring im out the next information is that is that i think i's ha good way of thinking about and one my wonder lol will how can do not mean be important for memory but also be important for movement and its really simple as just that its acting at different circuits the the the nurans that go to the motor areas that carry do not mean will will when do not mean is express there than and boosted there then itill be invoved in movement and lack of do not mean the basle gangill lea to ner log ofal sorters parkansiisease that has severe movement a difficulty but when it is acting in the frontal cortex ah and express the frontaol cortex than it is an in prove working memry soc is just tha the nature of where the circuits are where the do not mean is that is that is allowing it to have different kinds of actions and that is ought for all transmitters a the reason why ocile coling seems to be more important for longter memories because it it is projecting to the hipicapus which was he knows another ary that is in formed for memory and and that is why asl coling does not boostr working memory but do not mean does an viciversa i to take a quick brake to acknowledge our sponsor element element is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means zero sugar and the appropriate ratios of the electrolike sodium magnesium and patassium and that correct ratio of electrolihtes is extremely important because every cell in your body but especially your nerve cells your nurons relies on electrolihtes in order o function properly when your well hydrated and you have the appropriate amount of electrolites in your system your mental functioning and your physical functioning is improved i drink one packet of element dissolved in about sixteen to thirty two ounces of water when i wake up in the morning as well as while i exercise and if i've sweat elocturing that exercise i often will drink a third element packet dissolved in about thirty two ounces of water after i exercise element comes in a variety of different flavors all of which i find really tasty the citrists i the water mellini the raspberry frankly i cam't pick just one it also comes in chocolate and chocolate ment which i find taste best if they are put into water dissolved and then heedid up i tend to do that in the winter months because of course you do not just need hidration on hot days and in the summer in spring months but also in the winter when the temperatures are cold and the environment tends to be dry if you to try element you can go to drink elements spelled elementi docom slash hubermen to try a free sample back again that is drink element docom slash hubermen drilling a little bit more deeply in to the roll of dopamin and working memory you did some really lovely experiments a showing that if am people who have low levels of dopamn a increase their dopamine a phormochologically i think the drug that was use wass bromocriptine a that working memory improves conversely if one to pleas sdopamin pharmocologically doa working memory gets worse am but as i recall there was an important base line that is important because it really mattered in terms the altcomeaning if somebody already had relatively high levels of dopamian in thi circuit increasing dopamin further with bromocriptine did not i impart a benefit and might have even made their working memory worse there is a kind of inverted youshape function to thi a how does one know whether not ther base line dopamin is low medium or high urgo how do they know whet or not that they would a one to explore going about increasing dopamin through any number of different approaches right for most people probably have oftof al do not mean but there is a significant percentage that probably have too little or may be too much and it is ununfortunately we cannot measure in the blood an there is not a blood tests than i am aware of that can can measure a do not mean because it is stuck in a suckin the brain am preferal dopamin in the blood does not is not a good read out is not a good read out ye and and especially when youre talking about do not mean and in arias prefruntal cartec and a we do not have a good read out there there is there is in vase of procedures posotronomissian temography where we can inject a radio is ato a and tha tags dopt mean and then we can measure how much we can to a scan that actually show us us how much dope mean this scan was originally developed to show parkinseces that that you can digonos parkins disease by showing that there is there is less dope mean and inpatience parksis by looking at this the scan am oviously it is in vasof your injecting a eis itope is expensive and on something we could all do but we had use s to show that it correlates very strongly with your working memory capacityes o how much information you can hold on line if you can hold four or five or six letters when i do a a span task am correlated with how much dope men we can see n the petscan that that would be a away that we culd do it a if you were to read out a string of a few numbers or letters am and i can remember all of those a few moments later a perhaps perhaps might baseline dobe mean levels or a moderate in the in the normal range whereas if ih could not keep that on line that might be might be reflective of lower baseline dopening levels is thateright yes it is a very strong proxy for do not mean if your your working ouri capacity is seven letters when or numbers when i say for or three seven one five zero six if you get wees al rat vretty quickly you probably have more dot baseline doft mean than than some one who has five er iso it is it is a proxy for measuring ons onwe that that is one way of do it and that is actually how we did in our original studies we we actually a grup individuals base on whether their capacity base on this behaveral measure was high or low and you said those who work that can only hold five or six letters if we gave em bromal criptine which was the dopenergegagonists we improve their working memory ah we got them into servanoten level but but those who re already pie we actually made them we work we got them worse and the moral that story was that more is just not better were trying to get people optimal and the real question is is enough we want to get people oftemal you were inferring yit you have to know what their do not bean is where where are you on this inverted you curve another way of doing it i is throug am a genet dogenetic study we hav do not mean ald ner transmitters have to be broken down and reuptake into the into the brainsell in order to be used again and i's different ways of doing it in some sells a it gets transported back into the brain sell an other other places there is an ensime that that breaks it down while there is an enzim called compt ah that is breaks down dont mean in the prefront of quartex specifically in a large percentageof individuals that ensime is either overactive or underactive probably about twenty five per cent of individuals it is overactive in another twenty five per cent it is underactiv probtly half the population now this is gin a very depend on other where you live in where you come form in things but it but but maybe half the population either has an underactive ensim or overactive ens on if you have an underactive ensim an actually more do not mean sits around and uyou actually have more dope mean than others and if you have an overactive ens in it is the opposite we have actually shown that if you now goin geniatipe people with a simple saliva test and figure out do they have this genetic what we call polly morphisom where just one to meano assit gets changed and the ensin becomes either active or underactive we can we can do the same thing as is scrouping them by their capacity those that have the low dope mean weill make them et better and those who have sere baseln i do not mean will will make them worse superinteresting thn we could talk about broma cripting little bit and i'm not encouraging people to run out and take broma criptine romacripting as you mention is a dopaming agonist relatively short acting yev in for five hours six hours kikes in about it ninety minutes after right as i recall you said i have never taken at num how do people feel when theire on roma criptineg i meang when i hear a dopemin agonists hamming their lot of elicit drugs cocane it mathemphetamine that ar increase dopamine but then again chocolate the saxon food increased dope me but the canatics the time course and the levels are are different for each o rise things i'm dopeming of course being a currency of motivation and reward not not directly relate any one compound but m i would think that based on the data you just described that and given the fact that there are number of people out there with challenges in working memory attention taskwiching et cetera tit there would be a strong interest on the part of the farmer suitical companies at least and certainly the general public in things promacripting to increase dopemeang to increase working memory given it is our superpower ye i mean one of the most disappointing things to me in my career has been that farmer sroue companies have not picked up on this idea that we could improve cognition very specifically improve kind of process with very specific narrow modulators the the discovery that the poleceon of dot mean and not other transmitters in pairs work in memory was made in nineteen seventy nine when i heard a pat comicis talk about this as the resident i was just the maze that there could be a single transmitter can change a single behaviour i was sing very complicated behaveoral dephisis has just seemed impossible to me that there could be such a tightlic between us single a single nermodulator in single coinga process and just open the door for me that this really could be a credibly benificial therbe for for any any one with executive function of from ta of function but unfortunately there is never been a farme socomen thas tried to develop a drug for improving cognition to this that is a goodlasiay and they i mean its crazy for several reasons one is that the date are clearly there a too these drugs are already established dus not they have to go through safety trials again that that is already be done but mostly because regardless of whether one is a fan of the farmer suitical industry or hates it the farmer sui industry and principale can make a tonomoney doing thas i would think that they be heavily and sentivice to do it wi have they am turned a blind eye on this i 'm not sure i mean when i realize tham that i could tastthes strugs in in healthy individuals that that they were if i gave him and low enough doseis they were safe and and i had much experience of m in patience that i felt comfortable doing it im then i starte askig farm accompanies o o do on again involved here wewe can we this should be done i cannot do this by myself we need to have real trials and real studies of how this will help and just was enotheir eyes would always cross and never never got any any sor attraction in always went back tis sort of disease wat what disease are you am curing what what is the market for it is a aparkinss these things an alsimers is these thing an this has been a general problem with naurology it is very disease sentric it is always sort of foot and it is always focass on how can we develpatreton for housimers or termac rangryor stroke i suppose to howcoming develop a treatment for working memory tis function which is the problem of cross diseases te answer to your earlier questions these drugs are very safe they we give im in such low doses to help the individuals they do not even know they cannot even tell the difference between the plasee bell and the drug really they do not even know which one there on they are not buzzing thinking no this feels go ave noin my working memories better they ave know did theren't even know their working memories better s always we show im that their working memory is betters of it ye r there truly mind to what is going on broma criptine is but one of the dopening agonists can think of a few other keep rigolin other things that do any of these dopenming agonists a exert this a impact on working memory or is it thoes a very by drug because different a dopning agonists a to hit different receptor pathways and things that ye know it is not specific the drug i mean that the reason for bron criptine is that it is the oldest in thits one i was most comfortable with i had to be comfortable with thit clinically before i'd give it undergraduates that at ten or birklies there is nothing special but other agonists work similarly there is a there is a drug that is develpapartis which is a comptand habitter which actually inhibit is this this ends lime that were talking about an that that also willin prove a we will have the same at a function there is been some futre a work that nor up an neferan also seems to be helpful with working memory a it is not as a may be not is podent as as the dopen nurgic and that that is e point ot one to make andothe another disappointingthing about this whole field with the farm acology of cognition m you ny i wrote a paper as a residence ust sometimes your tending say can you write this refew paper for us and and i wrote one as a resident o call the farm acologi cognition where is looked at all the animal wertureon you kdo not a giving a nermodulators aso coling bron a do not mean orpedeveran and there were's a lot of ati therewas a lot of animal lettertur sor supporting that this would work in umens but was more striking to me was that it was not always just a single a ner transmitter there were studies where you would give do not mean and it would not do anything give asesol coling it would not do anything but if he gave a lowdose of both it would it would be really effactif these these nursesis systemstone act an isolation we needs also study sort of how the combidations work and that is where another where the farm swiconays have the infor structure to do these kind of says is very hard to do in a single lav to to do multibl drugs at at at one time you no and then trying look at trying to termine all the different in diractions ay be we could talk about a couple of other drugs that are legal or of and hav fty approval are known to be safe in the right context that am it seems would fit the bill here a for improving working memory one is well beutron brute pruproprun ruprupae i can ever pronounce that as far as i know it is a a a panefferin our norip an afor an agonist you just mention that increasing up and offer may have t a pausiv inpacting working memory and to some extended dopain agonist is there any evidence that well beutrin can improve working memory yean anything that em boose nor p an afrin can do it the one that we have use a that is most use is guon fasine which is actually a blood pressure medications that starting to gain some traction in fact i think there was a study with coa with brain fog for covas showing that improve a symptoms wit that there is actually some trials now that our looking at gon fasine and i would say anything that boosh's nor up an afran would be would be helpful but then again i do not won tom want to leave out the other transmitters iissir siratone and your increasing sare tone and increaseous o colling boose's other cogna processes and then in a way they can help working memory were we talk about working memory being being this foundation while if if you give vassal coling and cind of boose memory while thet can indirectly help your exact confunction ar f you give a a drug that improves your focuss the tack and indirectly help yeu no working memory when i am really pushing forcs is not just single you nots can be one dra ou no one drug it is gain to be a cocktail and we have te not only figure out what the cocktell is but also figure out who were given it to what is tot link et to the persons own make up of their own your chemistry when we get to a point where we will know we can magh outs or everyones do not mean nor up aneference are ton levels o then will make real progress and and helping them because right now i sort say with my students what we are doing is to o ust cutting opin the cull anto sort pouring in on to the brain not ly but actually doing if but it seems that way wer n the precision is not there yet will you it is great that you developed this am cogne of task that can be a proxy for dopaming levels the cognive task again being how many number letter string somebody can remember basely working memory performance there are a lot of tests out there that claim u they can assess dopamin and seretone in a syt of colling levels from a blood draw u'm afraid of the dutch test i've never r takin it but a few mor minutes ago you said that really weone needs to do positronomission tomography imagane which is fairly labour intensive most people do not of access to one of those t's a clinical tool uam there behaviour al proxies there is narro imaging but also to my knowledge i i do not know that there is any blood draw that will say hey you are ceretonean levels or lower youre dopenma levels or are moderate yours a t et cetera there are lot of companies that market these but are you aware of any clinical or other tools for getting an accurate read of ner transmino levels in in a person's brain aside from narro imaging no and an it is it is even more complicated than t seems because the doberner system is complicated because it is not only just the pre from the quartex as we talked about us also the basl ganglea and a not only do we have to measure do not mean just generally levels we have to measure the balance of the do not mean in thestry it and the and the prefroma quartex there is there is a model of do not mean am function and it is relation ext it exective function hit has to do with sort of the balance between these two systems that do not mean in the prefront of qartex is promoting sorstability it is it is keeping information ind mind skeeping these representations stable where is the do not mean in the basl gangle what it is doing is is allowing you to update and refresh the information that your that you are holding in mind this sor stability forsis flexibility if you have too much dobin from the quartes i canly to a very rigid state where you you do not let anything in and and if you have too much do not mean the stratum and yget too flexible than youcan get very distractable there is a sort of balance of do not means it is not just how much do not mean you have in your brain it is it is how much what is the balance of the don' means i do not see a blood tess as ever giving us that information but i do see ther being a a brain test that that can that can give us this kind of of information of athe to or least a proxy for it what i was thinking about when you are talking about asking this question you knont for example if you measure pupilary pupil dilation that is a pretty good proxy for nor for t e noragenertic system iit at to given a peoplel wonder what am how to do it where nocin a am go into too much detail here but at a given brightness in the room what we call luminance a the pupil tends to be smaller when it is bright and larger when it is a you are in a dim room that sort of obvious m but at a given luminance the more alert aroused somebody is uam arousal is a general term here am not not talking about a particular kind of arousal than the pupiltens to be more dilated it gets bigger the more a norpan fferont is not is ryin the system if somebody is pupils are really big in bright light a persons got a lot of a apan efferan a drenalin i in their system are you use this clinically a a when some one comes in an they the big oll yel yet ppoy in you ca theire probbly on a stimulant yes i mean a lot of anrology does is is try to look for these windows into the brain and i think there are number of windows into the brain that we aregan to be able to develop thac and reflect these nermaitory system that is why i've been interested and developing bile markers becauses really what a narrol bile marker is is is trying to a developd something you can measure easily and simply and cheaply with but gives you information about how the brain is working and that is a bi you now that is a nur up an nough from by a marker workan marrin capacities at do not mean by a marker and and we are getting better at that but a gan we are not putting enough emphasis on it in my opinion to really sort of help improve brain health have you ever tried bromacriptine very early on but it is it is such a low do that at the dose that the my subjects were getting by i said it does not it is low you do not fell inthing and i should say with even with patience am that take it they they rarely get iny side af facts sometimes a with these trugs because ters perfl do not mean they can get a oun nausyr oing but it is extremely well dolerae you do not get any any anything feeling from it does it change reaction time it does and that is always the question of of how much of is is that which jus sor speeding up wichust or making them faster but for all the work we have done it is it is pretty convincing that it is it is not just how fast you' doing it you are doing it better a you might find this entertaining some years ago a i learned that athletes a we are taking broma criptine a preolympics and in the olympics i think it is a band substance now and the atleats that we are taking it do not ask me how i know this but i could tell you off line u and i'm not one of these athletes nor was i supplying the bromcriptine we are using it because a that they were sprinters and it turns out the lot of the sprint races are one a by being first out the blocks there are other factors as well but that reaction time hundreds of mill a seconds are the difference between podium in nopotium and broma criptine was one of the drugs the used it was not on the band substance ilist i just a remind her that every lympics you see there are lots of things being use that are not on the band substance less and i'm not trying to be disparaging i think there is just a lot of interesting augmenting er emodulation for nervous system function bromacriptine was topitalist at that time i think it is on the band list now u there is a lot of a use of farma collegy now on college campases and in high school and even in elementary schools and sometimes by parents for their kids to trying improve cogne of function most typically the use of aterall viveants riddle in ind other stimulants which are noratridergicdopemen urgic agonis ocese with the a disclaimer coviat what ever you wone to call it that those decisions should always be made with i a trained psychitrist monitering things what are your thoughts about form a collegy for enhancing cogneif function given that the landscape of society is challenging and people want to perform whell they need to be able to focus we got smart phones distracting us and to some extend one could say alll it is cheating to use form a collogy but a cup of coffee is a bit of a norageran ergic agonist and dum certainly can pruse my focus in allas do not dering too much of it i yet wole your thoughts a just ye i think it a kind of gets back to we talked about there being an otimle otemal level of of dot mean in your brain i i think if you think about it as just more and more and more is better and that more is better than there is really know and di certaily know the hawd how much you should be taking this ser a is women was runing my adies all the cokin and a culture of of wall street in the eighties that we hather movies about it and it does not lead to good places right right i'm all for optimizing function a bego want oftemise brain health an if you have an under act of ensin that is not that that makes your do not mean levels than i'm all for trying to of temise that along with everything else we need optemze in the brain if we could figure out who i yet who is sort of on the lower and an boost them up i'm all for that the promise we do not know they are on the high end and some of thse attles were actually making themselves worse we know for sore i'm these are healthy ten and berkly undergraduras that we made them worse on working merry test i i increase my increasing ther dot man a just a little amount just tip them over just a little little amount and a and weyou non't without the knowing than it just it seems it is not well informed your an to be taking the other thing is i i i if we are going to do this we should do it right i think drugs at ar all in riddle and they were developed because they helped patience but they warn't nestally developed with knowing how exactly they workd an that is how the farm single company work tat as arise to ye i man t to it work thats ton i'm all for that as a physician but if i had my choice a drugs that boost up multiml sis all the catacola means the onces that pusap dope me epan eperan and norman afer an i i would steer away from those because you have no control over how your modulaing the system again i've sort of talking about a cocktell its it may be a little bit o dope men in a little more nore in efferent but if you give take them riddlean our all you just gin the same amount is it is kind of if i was to start ta sort of experiment a than i i'd except boun i would not use tat ar all a riddlan as that as the drug that i think wit healthful even though there clinically ser ofe you sol i use things frown criptine quonpacine were they conmodulate a very specific drug and then and then yot than the goal is to tof temise and and that is what we are trying to do with cogna the ther therabe and everything sleeping better and better ninturest all these are aiming to othemize not reach some super you man fitential right just bring out the best in in people's abilities rm and i'm i'm glad you mention sleep i was say you a sleep is the the better ack its the foundation of mental health physical health and performance amean without that farm acology might bridg you for an afternoon but you can to pay the piper somehow our friendin colli matwalker obviously is a in beating that drum a while what about drugs modapanil which our thought to be true cogniof inhancers as opposed to drugs that just cond of r design to ramp up levels of alertness i imany the drugs were discussing do yet's hard to know i may i think certain drugs just improve general abilities either they bee how fast you can procus et or how eficient you camprocus or or narrow the focus of your tention and that just helps all abilities it is it is hard to say i think tis his has to be more work i'n really understanding what specifically ah yhou not these drugs are doing that is quike pron cripting the the dobenark stories been inturesand because is a very specific a fact or the very specific mechanism i to see that be done with with other ner modulators may we could talk a bit about some of the disease conditions that you treat and the roll of working memory in dopening in those conditions as well as other transmitter systems you knon one subject that we have not talked about on this pard cast a previously but is of tremendous interest to people is tramatic brain injury er concussion even mild concussion and before we were recording day we are time out football but sone to remind people that football is just one instance of an opportunity to get a concussion or dramatic brain intry most dramatic brain injury cussion is not do to football it just gets a lot of the attention but you have got bi scal accidents car accdents playground accidents a maybe could list ouf a few more but how common is tby i in concussion and and maybe could just perhaps i list out some of the other situations where you see a lot of this u that it is a bit more criptic that people would not uscerily think that sporter that that population gets tebei what they do ye i think concussion i is much more provalent than we we realize and and the numbers have gone up and up nop because it is becoming more commicious is becoming more recognize and i think i we we under estimated and trivealize or what a concussion is as is that is just the you as something that is am thou not just you are ging to recover from it i mean still the old school thinking by a a lot of nrall jus is that every one gets better within a copleamons just just waighted out and you will get better that is just of the normal time course of concussion but as we have studied it more i we realize that there is aa quite a large percentgeof people who a year out there is still suffering problems they still feel they are not mentally clear and they still are sensitive to light and they still feel a little dizzy and n just the symptemyuknos a host of symptoms that just one year later after a concussion where they did not even lose consciousness that something that they may not have even talk to their doctor about is is is is lingering and it is a real this we call tus persistent post concussions in german that is the most worrisome to me because it is true that most concussions will recover lucki the brain is incredibly rasiliens incredibly plastic and it it will heel itself but they are a lot of patiencs where just it just persists in those of the most worrisome to me because we do not have very good interventions to try and help that andi do not think we take these patiencs very seriously when they are complaining of something that seems very vague and not very specific to most os adoctors what do you tell a patient who comes in and it is clearly how to concussion my old wor severe concussion you maybe car accident maybe sports injury maybe they were knocked out cold maybe not but theyre aving some headaches an photofo be a youre sensitivey liges feeling not right i i've had it a couple these unfortunately and yu just feel off you on' feel quite right and some of that manifestis focus issues this was some years ago i to thin im through it i've had scans and im good think think in tiss but what do you tell them besides do not get another one ye will first of all i i explain what a concussion is when i've found anourology lot of what patience one to know is just thay just one understand their problem that walking in expecting a cure it just just a understanding what it is having some one understand what what happened to them is is very helpful and uncomforting what we mean by concussion and we in the clinical world will use moltramatic branjury konisan onestly with concussion a it it is it baselyis is a tearing of axons it is the brain the brain sells have these long fibres that communicate with each other and the're called axons and when the brain violently move forward and backwards if you are in a car accidents and eve yu see belt on and you suddenly hit you go from fifty to zero youre head violently goes forward and vilably goes backwards and that angular force actually tears and stretches axons in the brains if you had a concussion you have torn some axons an luckily we have billions huf and if you tear a couple o thousand you you will recut youwill recover but you you have torn axs on thits a real nor logic it is a real r ain injury even if if even if you have an lost ta consciousness and you have only as symptoms for a couple of days but there an is a correlation the longer you have lost consciousness and the long your symptoms last an war axcons you you have torn this kind of a direct relationship between the two the the mechanism is is these tornacsen now of nurse of do not communicate with each other and that the the brain different brain reagers are not communicating with each other i'm and it turns out the most common place for acts on ceters and in the front o lops and now we talked about all these things at the front he libs due to workingstraight the rest of the brain while it does not it has some injured pathways and that is why a lot of the symptoms that patients have are these kind of milds executive symptoms this this mental fogness that theire describing is this abilit just this unability to to to get things get things done they do not lose knowledge of who they they do not for get their name or you do not forget where they live or lose memories from the past or anything that but they just they do not officially get things done as well as they use to and only takes a little bit of a drop right you people think you have to have a big a drop in performance to have i have a real life in pact just one per cent drop and your you having a hard time doing your bycastor e teaching a lecturer or whatever you might do bu one per cent drop sounds a a frighteningly small change ave required to to negatively impact life owbut a poor nights sleep me what kind of drop in prefrunt al cortical function are we looking at om from let us ay i'dnormally get seven or eight hours or sixty eight hours and i odenly only get three or four are we talking a significant detriment i i do think i i do think that yet that that that the it is significant this ia poor night's sleep and and and we all now we all notice that i mean it is very it is very obvious i mean and yu and and it is hard to sor of quantify i i'm a baseball fan i can quantify it it if you think about it in a pictur and how fast they throw a small drop for them f some one is throwing a hundred miles an hour just a small drop turns then you now from really a lee to some one mediocre maybe it is more of at ten per cent dropbut but it is still relatively small drop can have a uge in fact i think people think that just because your little bit off that is not and that is not a big deal you cana you cint of work through it and that is what most talktors sa iust just just plough through it just just work your way through wich you are ging to get better and i suppose to saying ye you really have a brangery this is what happened we need to reabilitate you just we would do if you tor your antercrucialigamen i do not know why tearing your cusia ligim in or your killy's tendand gets more interest then then tearing axons in in your brain it is it is amazing to me that that there is more emphasis on northpetic injuries than than brain injuries ye i do not know why that is either i think the brain is mysterious enough that most people an and many clinitins us coun to back away with hands raised but if you are in the feeld of naurolegy our sychi tr aspos it than one has officially signed on to tryiand resolvings matters im i for somebody that am has a dramatic brain injury or or low level conput concussion excuse me im would part of the a primary advice beed to trying get one's sleep as as good as possible be given that sleep deprobation can compound i'm dramatic brin injury a induce defisist an working memory and who knows maybe a good portion of the defisisten working memory due to dramatic brain injurying concussion is because of the sleep deprobation that it can call ut it gets it can get circular not only that but one of the most common symptoms that patience my patien with cussion have is is ther sleep is isterruptive that they the and that is true in narolege it is fascinating almost every neurological disorder my patiente complain their sleep and and i start o asking you knw not a lot an ral to sas you how your sleep but i really reeme back from my redsy one of the first things my attending wuld do whn we got to the warders that ac tou sleep last night and t just a cross the bard patience or not falln asleep but they are not stay in asleep and i's it is a we still understand why just brain injury does that some almost every concossient patience says i'm not sleeping well which then compounds compounds the probem oftemize i sleep obviously optobize ind utrition im there is a a question about activity it used to be that i wused to recommend hat a concussion you should you should thet do not go to work you knots sleep jut just take it easy for while do not exerci keep the blot ee blind after on now it isit is it is the idea that you should really get up and moving as best you got you got a do what you can tolerate you do not want to give yourself at you off you don want to give yourself more of a headache ar more likhe sensitivity but as much as you can tolerate is is the the thought these days about sort of promoting recovery and then really getting your brain back working i think lot of my patience they are off from work for a couple weeks and they feel fine and they they think the pretty much normal than the first day o work as a complete disaster bigus until you actually test it in real life you do not know how what kind of trouble is you have i do not recommend going back full steem but i do recommend going back trying to build up these thes stills skills again and then i think we i think we need to devolop therapiece that people will will use things gold manmen training which involves a therapes han pealthinsurance does not pay for this ninety nine per cent of my patience do not get any help by any kind of intervention a unfortunately but now we talk about t acnolegy things am braina cu about braini bacus o mike mersonic a which i know youve talked about with that he developed a a a a a company call posit science for were developed these brain training games that that can help and prove specific cognit of functions and they are very easy to do because they are on line and they you not their ter science behind them and and you can you can do im that in that way you do not have a therapists in your room but you can on line sort of do these sort of things that are tardening specific mec mechanisms tor trying to improve the kind of things that we think are impaired by concussion and i to see more patience gets started on some of those things vordarly yif you go on the wab and just o do brain training you will be overwhelmed with things and you do not know what works one what does not work e i i think the work that mersonic and colleagues have done and wi'll provide a ling to that i do not have any financial stake in his in his work or products trainings that is but i will say i think mike's work has been a tremendous om and ye is far ahead of the curve twenty years ago everyone wis tikeabout narrow plasticity in critical periods they give a no abolt prize to it to my scientific great grandparents david hubon't torrensome wheasel and they deserve that nobole prize but tere was a and of a central tenant of narrow science at that time was that critical purio plasticity ends around adolescence or one's early twenties and that is simply not true in mersonic really i think one of the people who deserves credit for making it clear that plasticity is on going i takes some focus in and a work to access it in adulthood but that we can all access noro plasticity but it it takes it is there o on they shuld give mersan ic an kno bell too but that you nom not on the committee just ile editorial there the description of specific cogny of trainings that can improve working memory in people that have had tramatic brin inturior concussion as well as our earlier discussion about the development of fronta lod function and plastese af front ta low function makes me wonder is the working memory circuitry and fronta low function a usit or lose it kind of circuit meaning if somebody you do not gos t a high school graduates high school and then gets into a a life style or college in the gargerys college as well and then gets into a life style where they are not reading very many books theyre deafling scrolling social media theyre carrying out their daily tasks with yu know apparently a high degree of functionality but theyare not really pushing these forbrain circuits do we imagine that some of those forbraine circuits regress ac use it or lose it seems to me that a few years back may be ten fifteen years back thate was a lot of interest in how to maintain cognan function in fact won he most common questions i would get even as a nurscientist primarily folksst on the visual and not anomic norous system was how do i keep my memory as i age it seems to me that training it up and then continuing to use those circuits as it would be a really good way reading books without forcing oneself to finish the chapter even though distractions jump into ones said things that a for me it is when i go tho jim i trying not to bring my phone and if i do all this into one album of music but i will not allow myself to playin my phone i try i mean not interrupting a conversation wit text messaging i mean basy that the landscape i'm tryin to a draw here is seems the world is designe to to disrupt that the modern world is desine to disrupt working memory in cognition of the front alongs and we need to do some real training just muscles and atrophy and cardiacpitness atrophes if we are not doing ready a youn o resistance in carty of ascular training s that is a yet i think that is fair i think of all the systems i that decline with aging not every brain system declines but certainly the frontal executive sinc some talkin about as one that takes more of a decline than others that just how it is with with healththy aging im not surprising it is it is the most complicated system and it is prily the most biologically costly and the more complicated system is in a a take more of a hit thats than other systems and certainly im i do not know about regressing but certainly we are not or we may be accelerating this this this a decline that we know exists and but a way i would think about it though is is that not just am trying to prevent the decline but what we talked about befor it is no reason not to optimize i nm if if everything is couched and i do not want to get to mentiand do not want to et alsimer disease and i do not want to get this in that i think that is not the way we should be looking about we want to look about optimizing health and and abrain health and and and getting up to our optimal levels a because otherwise beut always playin defence instead of playing playing offence nd that is really hard for naurologist we we have a hard time thinking about brained health even though we are the brain specialists we think about brain disease and we are just now as i feels are thinking about prevent tet on neurology which s in in thinking about it not just stopping alcimer isease but a promoting healthy health in a healthy brain raldus nrodison talk to patience abouts or healthy patience about being healthier i love how canded you are about the medical fectn and hown and i to thing to changing i know something happened in the in the twenty twenty twenty twenty one a ere i that i feel is just my my bias but i feel that the general public star to becoming more aware of the things they might do to support their mental and physical health may be they had more time on their hands but think there is just more forging for information am i love the idea that through simple practiseis forcing one'self to read a book chapter start to finish without looking at one's phone even if it takes twice as long as one would u redirecting one's focus when focas moves away is way of keeping working memory in cognite function on line may be even strengthening it as you said optimizing it am i think that they are much emphasis now on physical health which i think is great slee thanks to mat walker if you really you do not brought that tortu in on sleep and now others myself for i really you don' tryn to amplify the message of the critical rule of sleep but also yomust beople realize they should not me at least walk as youav the ten thousand steps thing is not a bad idea getting some part raie up a few times a week or more may be doing some resistance training a few times or week or more and then and not just for athletes but for elderly folks men and womend i feel we need the same for cognition forment for a brain function and he're just isn o structure to that no one can say right now you need to do a three chapters of reading fiction per week or a you get a reada you d learn a few new vocabulary words and thn write sentences with them thate they do in school but then were just set into the general population and right and must be blei think fregress right ye i may ni i think the big problem a with brain health is is trying to have a measure of what brain health is and it is interings to me again as a physician thinking about it from an rall to standpoint a when you go ito your family doctor your primin care physician every year from your yearly physical a they examine every organ in your body except your brain your lungs your hearts uyour skults a me skin but what what do they do for yyou know outside of having a conversation with you and no cogne there is not non working memory tey dont measure you your brain at all and and it is not their fault ther we havent provide the field as not provided them with a test of of a brain health right and part of the promise we do not have a measurement the brain health i i'm involved and it is something alle the brain health project which is at youte dallous which is their goal is a study a tonrol a hundred thousand peopl in a and they have been developing ap brain health indecks and a that is a complicated thing to do but i i really believe their augnt to son to because it is not just coctision its cognician it is its social it is it is life style likes sleep an and it is it is a well being youthe brain a brain health indexis can o cover all of these aspects of they have develpe quite a interesting a important index which which can which just try to capture all aspects of brain health and then can be used to track a re you contract your brain health over time with interventions that they they develop we we need something we need the first once we develop a brain health in dects that that then then we have something to to follow and to and to be able to measure if if iif we are optenizing your brain al otherwise how do if your wou're optemizing your your brain health you dout your doctor's not on you you do not know i'm all these games you get on in the web do not really tell you i'm will not we develope that ah then all of the things that can promote rain health will be measurable and i think it will take off the way physical fitness that perhaps you get enough of it from your work but given what about brain health and approaches to brain health what are some of the things that you do besides sleep exercise nutrition 'm in terms of 'm trying to optomize brain function i'm indoyou make it appoint to read fictiond you make it appoint to learn new new skills instrumen ins things that again may be your profession in your and your personal life keeps you busy enough that yo do not have to do those things i man for me i've a gathering organizing an dissiminating the information for the podcast feels that that that the heavy lifting mental work for me but but i'm keenly aware of but the fact that were i to read more fiction or i'm learnan instrument ii mean everyone else around me would suffer if i learn an instrument but i'm that it wiill probably benefit me in some real way at what of the things that you do ore and that you i'm you think our kind of occess points that hopefully people also enjoy ye know i i iagree that i i think when you have a i busy careering your doing many different things teaching and research and seeing patients i've always felt that i i'm maxing out in i'mol and i'm full my exacutive functions being tested to limit but be can askiyou a professional lathlead of the mind ye in a way but then then you realize thers that that is that is not you kow that is not everything there there is many other aspects a everything emanates from the brain yo start to think about what should i be doing in my my life is is a father and i husband what what what should i be doing yon terms of promoting social interactions with friends and and dow what should i be doing for sleep and health that a sleep and nutrition i'm as fin you bring up books i i think you not went proly twenty years ere i never read any nom you miany fictional book and sait this this cannot be good for my brain and then just consciously started reading i reading am books and reading his an more non fiction books and just listening to books or reading reading ar yes the to red e aryevers ye whise unfortunately when i was undergraduates you of with premen thay do not let to take any courses that are interesting i never learned any history or or you k all the books that i never read i start reading my kids inglish luse your books that i never out a chance to instorn reading history and ye ialways felt just leke g just increasing not you just knowledge was was enot i sai r brange of stores in formation that is one of it is this cob that that is ot to be useful but but again im all of these things that i do believe help brain health wwe need we need some way to metmeasure it i think i'm certainly if you feel healthy tht's an important thing f you feel your healthy physically are mentally that is that is good that is a good start but if we actually had a way thi sor of track at the way we can track heart disease and long disease and skin and things that i think that woild really post everyone is confidence that this is really making a making a difference on the basis of to day's conversation i 'm going to read some fiction a i read a lot of non fiction u and i enjoyed i listen to some audio books but i i just it is crazy to me because i'm a norrow scientists by training and i understand neur oplasticity and i do kno a bit about fitness and the key roll of remaining active con usiter lose it and maybe improve it right kind of that was not intended to rime folks on a behaviors but clearly based on everything you have told us that if we do not exercise these working memory another caht circuits for cognition why should they stick around andand i'm beginning a think that csocial media is entertaining as it is and i learn there and i teach there but that it is not a cohesive plot rihts those baby auters that really cool looking dog that i love to own i'm think abi can another dog this interesting conference that it is it is random sudo random tailor to me of course as that is whath their algarithms do but but that is not following a plot character development antagonists protagonists i any of thethelike things that provide cognive richness is cone of obvious as i as i ay this but a i feel we are divorced from these things that really help ivolve culture and involved individuals and and it takes some discipline but of run ore going to the gem you do a few times for shorter amount time with lesson tenses e prety soon our upt to speed and there is anopper threshold let yo an n be a pro yuar not got em cerainly i can be ananatalate professor i do not think i obviously boosting exict fintions credibly importan but i do not think its can happen just what acknowledge i think it is kin and he it needs youm an interactiond i mean i i believe exect conlen should be taught in school as one of the court as as a course all this school magimenthory that talk about could be taught in school wit is what you do with your students for example when you have a graduate students im and they have to learn how to read the literature and desig an experiment tand carry out the experiment ih there is no tecnology that is gin i just be able to teach him out to do that you have got it intervene sometimes and they stop reading all those papers are an not relevant o k or your you'r you' pilot it this enough get going it is it is that kind of wisdom that that that you get when you get older that that that that allows that has to be i has to be on top of the the the tecnology that is why i think im we also need eeds to be directed whether it is in school or whether it is in a patient i think there still needs to be on coaching us i know that is why life coaches hav have been sometpeople really benefited from lifecoaches because soe one just it sounds obvious when you tell your kids just right you now just just do it this way break it op into little pieces it seems obvious but to them it is not always obvious and they just need to be told something simple for it to make a pig difference and in school we were we are brought along step by step and though is contact white would not it be the same an adulthood m i'm realizing a shprite learn how to play chess seems a good game rit chet chest yet any any one ans working memory y got to keepinformation on line her there is a bunch else there i think a but as a tool to improve cognition i was alsothing though some people or yet more towards the arts my sister is really great about if she is a therapist an it in sirmisiscobut also im takes theader classes and she said you knowlin improvis i forces you to keep on your toes keep the contact there you are up on your feet it andiid was not a theater kid i did the crew i did the pulling the curtains and stuff to i whon did other things but but but that whole bis is about being you n a learning the novel rule set in the moment improph by definition absolutely i mean anything that requires you to have that where there is a goal and you have got a break it down it a subgoals and you have got o do it simultaneouslyin you got o filthrorgh out distractions and you now for example my my kids got me one of these piets of an for for i christmas and youythink it is easy to ser makes some peets and throat in the oven and done it is r i o my third time and it' still not even round i canoi'll ga it sone's good an yet you are in a sin wit great foo as of the standerd is really high attempted to make a reference to the sheese bord peets o but i wan to keep the lines a short as possible cause they are already too long may bou we could talk a little bit about some other unfortunately common disease states parkinsons and al'shimers let us start with alshimers i think few few things i scare people more than the idea of getting alshimers especially if they have al'shimers in their family first of all what is the cunatic link with al'shimers if one has a parent or grand parent that got allshimers is there unknown increase in in their one's risk for getting alshmers it is not that straightforward its other diseases theres disease huntingeas where it is a very strong ling that if you have a apparent you have a very high chance of getting it but there is many factors that ta it is not necessarily case that youre youre increase yeriss of of getting it there are families where there is something special about the family where just runs in families but a i try a to a not scare my pa patiente children into worrying that that there not surtely going to get alsimers because it is not that straight forward as i understand alsehimers is it the nerges gender of disorder a impacs the hippocampus among other structures there is been some debate in recent years as to whether not the whole ameloid hypothesis is real or not there is a punsha unfortunately false data accusations and that whole thing but my understanding is that if you look at a slice o human brain from an als a patient that died with alshimers i maybe even from alshimesmers that you see placks and tangles you see these am subseller structures and build up and that our basic understanding of alshimers thats in the taxbookn that most people have heard of a is still correct right yes oke because they think o a couple years ago it was an unfortunately the way social media sometimes can work is that the idea was that it was all wrong r i know all wrong and indeed somebody somebody fudge data they made up dayand thand that is terrible am but alsheimers is in e nerge gener of disorder includes the hippocampus placks and tangles or present in the nerons those are not good for nerons as i understand what is the controversy and and why do not we have a treatment for alsehimers yet i feel almost every other psychiatric disease including parkins ands there there certain things you can do to at least push the system in the right way whys alseheimers an other dimensias tricky ye i man is very frustrating because o the ner de generalsors is it is a many factors that are probling voled in the pathpathology that there is not once iu o one single a transmitter then parkins disease ats a decrease dop mean and one transmitter can make a very bi difference am early on an alsehimers that was discovered that there was low assil coling an in the brains and if only approve a treatmen for alsimer diseaseis e drug that boos assil coling twhat is the drulyre is called the napasil there is a few of em there anticolinestris and hibiters that boos asilcoling they have been around for twenty years or more and the reality is when you give it to your patience they do not see much of of a difference because it is it is not the primary dapasits of the real problem has been trying to find out what is the primary mechanism that is leading to this ththe wide range of cogna behavoral issues and and and there does not seem to be at least one nor transmitter that can make the difference and now the push has been is ther one is there something else that we can do can we can we block ameloid we blocks something in the pathology and again it just has not been i successful it it is very freshlyg because i think it was over prie thirty five years ago i saw my first alsamers patience and i do not believe i say that much different them now except that we have a lot more things we can do just on the social side of things but unforcenatly for drogs we do not have anything that is been really transform enough u but again that that is i i think part of a in being in ragas it sounds very depressing but i think part of the family what the family is not always looking for cure of course that is they would to have a cure but i think them understanding what is going on what to expact had to handle the behaviors is what theye really after at least until we find a cure parkinsons you mentioned is a deficid in dopam enurgic function do largely to u degeneration of dopam an urgent erns there there is some some effective treatments right el dopa did ther this over the counter the stuff that sold that a lot of people take who do not have parkinson i'm not suggesting they take it called macuna prurines it is the velvety bein ye ve heard of it is nine or nine present eldop however yet it is in present and some energy drinks and supplements and people go by it i'm not suggesting they do that i sheuld tried it boy feel being really dopamen doubt does not to me does not feel that good you ave fell con agitated my vision go twinkle it did not feel a high of any kind and then i felt lousy for copleowers after it were off ye i do not think you can really get in enough feldopa to get enough into your brain that that happened early narology when it was discovered we could not give our patience enough fell dopa without them feeling bad because it is all im matabolize in the peripery and was not till we got' synimet came along which is has i debocxiis the carboxis inhivert at block sort of the tha the break down of doing that we were able to sort to get enough do not mean into the brains i'm not sure yet that that is why i think im it is not gan a prye get the level supply enough in in the brain parkinson's patients are given al dopa or broma criptine or drokes that going back to allshimers for a moment i mean what you tell it somebody wh has early stage allitime as you just say listen tryiand get good slee try and keep people around you stake cogniably engaged try and keep those circuits going through behavioual inducing aroplastisity but werscan a watch the the the steepness of the decline is that rei really all we have got the all we have got at uch ye is to help them up with everything that comes up on a day to day basis aalot the problems the memory problems tend to be something that ta families can help compensate for but it but you do get to a point where you cannot be with someone for twenty four seven it said the real burn out for for caregivers the lot of the behaviors that come up a patiencs get kind of delusions and agitated and and some of the ah medications that we use for other conditions a our helpful for for treating that but it it is really just a purely symptematic therbe and the more socialization that patiencs get the ten they tend to do better there was a study back at panuay back that if he showed patience am family movis or family abums it was a real k i was better than any drug you could give them to sor help their behavior there is still those memories or in there and they were making sometype of contact that was was helping them emotionally that you could not turn off with with ta drogs i think the more we do things that the the more will be helpful for them allease in it a symptematically hoa i've seen a number of vidios and on social medio people with alseimers who a listen to a piece of music or people with parkinsons that heare a piece of music and that seems to a resurrect some at least emotion contaxt appropriate emotional state what he come brings the person to the to the surface again ye agava tragic situation for alsheimers right now it seems if ever there was a call to arms for the neurology community and am baotac and behaviour all tac wu be for to for for alsheimers for the treatmentof olshimers absolutely i will never ask a guest to comment on the the the good are bad behaviors of other people except my own but o there is ing no bell prize winning neuro scientist and i visited him he is 't a biggeyscost school a back in two thousand ten and dring the course of our one hour meeting he consume no fewer than four pieces of nicaret gum and i said got ask what is this about by the way he is extremely sharp still and he said oh ye ye i used to be a smoker but smokings really bad for bouecause you can get long cansr dippings bad for you could you get mouth cancer but nicotine these are his words by the way it is protective against parkinsons and alsheimers and it keeps in my brain sharp you nickeret all day long and i thought oke well he is not he is an empty actually and i thought that is interesting and i did not an episodeto this potcast on nicotine it by the way can raise blood pressur it is certainly smoking baping dipping our snoffing not good bad do not do it but there is some interest in the use of nicotin as a cognive and hanser i'd love to know your thoughts on that and i'd love to knw your thoughts on his statement about nicotine being a a potential way to stave off parkinsons and alsheimers with the cavyacht that he just cone it through that out there in the skys a sort of known for just kind of throwing stuff out there everynassan whil i have a feeling who this person mens but in any wen what gives yet wele i do not know anything about nicetine saving off any nergen of disorder but nicetin was use a and it was used in a number of early alsimers studies just because of its effect on ult the colinergi a systems there is some truth to that a the coiners xsystem is is a imping o disfunctional an alsimerieasant in boosing the colonergic system probably is beneficial i mean patience that woeld give the aticolonessers in hibiters there are some families that say yet he just see sees remembering more andhe just doing better there there i've seen positive things to it a it does not really slow the course of the disease that is the promits thes just carries ot even the worse symptematically improving the symptems it again i think it is going to take both asilcoing and something else i think we do not know should we give dot mean with thi with the nicetine or the asecoling shure we norpe nopfen i think it is going to be a cocktail which which again farmesuk a companies have not tried a cocktal of narmodulators fralsimes they have just tried houseof coling sells a you should be running ftie no disrespect to the current people in charge by the way but mayme asham am big believer that there should not be individuals in charge of large organizations there should be panels entheres much talk about diversity but they appoint individuals he cannot get it right any time there is when there is only one person by definition socri committee committees anyway another editorial are there any sex differences mal female differences in sort of u these dopaming levels working memory injuries concushian things that would direct people toward differen routs of treatment given that maybe there is more susceptibility in one case maybe less susceptibility maybe certain orr transmitters are more effective in improving symptoms an in men ver su women do you see that in the clinic ye that is a great question there was a emily jacob suits of professor at you see sana barber now in the psychologe dapartment a when she was a gradisin my lab study the role of essergan on working memory and dobenergic function an which he brought to my attention at the time and was embarrassing that i did not know was that there is the fronteloves are full of escergand receptors irs frolly more estan receptors in the fundelovs than any other part of the brain in men and women esterton booses dotme you a higher estergan levels corelates with with increase a do not me a levils and and there wase some anecdotl evidence that in postmen opazil women women who were put on escergan that the working memory improved and there was a a kind of evolving link between estergen in front te low function and she does is amazing study where she studied healthy a berkely undergraduates at two points and time during the mentual cychle when estron was that is lowest and what was highest and she also am senatike them for the sentime they were talking about the know if they were sort of lower or higher on the dotme level and then put them in the scanner measured frontal of function and and showed that there was a clear the frontal of function was modulated by where they were in their estran pcsyche when they were low esterogen they were low dopming and if they were lowester and and low doping to start they were really had decreased frontalo function and decrease working memory ability it i fluctuated a based on this interaction between estiton and do not mean suggesting that you are not on don' meanins important but hormon sir clearly important that and they they work a since sinc inergestically you nas for developing this this cotal am we certainly have to bring hormons into the a quasion and learn more about it there just little information about am hormons and cognition yet one of the themes thats come out of some the episodes we have done with emdies who specialize in endicren health is that for both men and for women am optimizing estrogen levels is really importedt for cognition and vascular function i think people mistakenly here oka testosterone men estrogen women obviously both hormones are present in men and women in fact i think u i know that testostron levels and women are actually higher than their estrogen levels when you look that when you tove am a ouse the same units of measure it just happens that they still have lower testosterone on average than the typical mail but that men whos estrogen levels are too low suffer cognive defects an vasular defects ol this idea that more testosterone lower esterogen n in men as is the is the ideal right and a it just does not hold right does not hold them and unless you want to be domb and have a hard attack ther just justin at just does not hold very interesting do we know estrogens doing there is it its its specifically raising dopamin ah might we doft have to gat to the en aptic biology yes sexulalr interesting as yesactually boosting adot mean activity it is making more dopamean available ye ye a it is it is really a amazing and and am and to think about it sort of fluctuating am certainly during the mentual pcychle we can think about how much of fluctuates an in igualwmen over three days but than you can think a cross individuals you can think about how how much it can account for individual difference is not only sor knowing your dot men level but i knowing sir vestrian an a hsertainlans really an to be important interesting is there any evidence that physical exercise can improve working memory in cognition separate from the known improvements in carty of ascular function and blood flow to the brain that occur with exercise as there anything about going for if forty five minute bowd of exercise an pic yur favoredeexercise and then doing cognive work immediately afterward when presumably the caticol means dopening ar up an eferan an eper an feraner gn be circulating at leat in the blood at higher levels is a is ory as that stuff ever been explort iin all the groups around the country that are trying to develop konknr therapies they they often use erobic exercise as as as another type of therapy and and that for example the group at universe illinois acampain our cramers group as youan arobic exercise quite a bit and they can find at just as effect of as cognan therapyin iproving executive function just straight up now erobic exercise well and dom and the hard part in the real world is is had you get you knw a seveny or eight year old do the kind of a robix said but but now it the know recomeent bicycles and now there has been studies with seven year ols with just putting him in mostly with overcome bicycles as sor f designing we have to think about ways the design exercise that can get arobics up but it is it is a and noraljust or starn't i think my feel the starring to realise that there is there is we got a tackle this at all all every way we can and now ofm hearing you hear more noroltus talk about thirty years ago know know nroliger say you gat exercise more or just now it is er talking about exercise an nutricion and sleep and and you it is all becoming sort of part of our package ive hargan help our patience but the aropicacises as suis superinteresting and and i think it is going to be you kow that that kind of made me think that am what we did not talk about was mindfulness and when we at lot of these studies also if they had mindfulness training to the chard cork go manerge been training it is it is better than than just the the executive training alone just learning skills to stop relax refocus kind of gives thi sort of boost o to executive function as well ei think of mindfulness t sort of ut there is no such thing as traditional meditation i have to be careful here but but they the sort of steratypical meditation of closing one eyes closing one's eyes excuse me sitting down lying down and and just focussing on one's breath and then redirecting one's focus to may be third ec enter the o area between the forehead just redirecting focus redirect i think of meditation of that sort as a focus exercise right it is it is not much a perceptioal exercise because thoughts are kind of you do not do in what they are doing om focus exercise and that is half of the problem with not achieving our goals right as we we lose our focus and building into sort of strategies to to main focus a you now to stop and lacks an refocus as is an important strategy an for boosting executive function and that aand it does not seem to matter what i know thit is alter from flavors of mindfulness a we just happened to use on when we were studying it it does not yet i do not think we know enough about how we should tell er the mindfulness but most forms of myfulness will work of of the type your talking about tha's similar what i describe to samlar to what yes ext exactly ye it is amazing to me twenty years ago if somebody one to talk about nerosins in mindfulness on a major universy campas let us tay stamford or a berklar is poblybl bit halleras ideas at that time just given the ye the kind of culture a they would have been laughed out of the room but but there was a lot of skepticism and i feel now mindfulness meditation breath work the idea that ye my goodness breathing can impact your emotional state ye i mean that shouldhave been obvious and now that people are on board that and now of course threis a lot of interests in psychadelics is kind of a new emerging therape carying more risk potential risk but it looks its very likely to some of those ware ging to make it through the the f t fill there is at some point but the conversation were having now y nor all yes o nor by all just talking about minefulness nutritian were talking freely about nicotine were not suggesting people do that bromor criptine as i to optimized cogna function of me this conversation would have never happened am seven years ago no it just the field has changed yet nor i here ner alas talkd about it all the times tiso do try mindfulness and if you do does it make your d you feel you perform better that a things for asking no forms of yes the short answer is yes am i there is as a very specific practice that i've use since twenty seventeen that is really benefit in me much which is an what i call it non sleep deep reast but it is based on a practice called the oga netro where you just lie down and it is a these are free audio scripts on line we can vidlings to these and you go through abody scan and you do some long acail breathing which emphasizes the pari sympathetic c relaxing aspect of the autonomic nervous system i know that om saying for the audience a and it does involve some intentions an things that but it can also just be a self directed relaxation and i emerge from that with much more mental and physical vigor than i did prior and this only takes may be ten minutes there is also a thirty minute scripts i do those and then i do a mindfulness meditation the thing about mindfulness meditation that the biggest impact for me has been the problems of my life a get re a i get a ifferent perspective i start thinking about things in different domains of time this thing that is a problem that i've been dealing with for instance i mi starts thnk ing in the course of my lifetime this is you kno relatively small not small thing but in relatively small time been and i sort of think about you best course of action given it is real role in my life and what i want et cetera i feel its w of ornients met in time u that is been a major effact for focus the best tool i knowis to you put the phone in another room m not cone of i do not and i know our friend ad echang ner surgeon chair of nurse or gat you see us af he is big on unmindfulness meditation yot dit do you meditate now i think that is one other things morewer talking about what shoul we do besides reading fiction i think that that shoud be on my list becithin is is as i yet now i gas is just amazing that i that h the patients tell me about it and what we have seen from or our studies a lot of this a again i was saying befors is if wee had some measure of a brain help that we could see the impact of it what sort of push us towards dur sina proly doing it more i think another thing that we would in sort of talking abou we talkd a littl about what do not mean as are there other kind of brain states that sort of a predict how you are ging to respond to these therapes and and ow if if you are going o benefit from em and and a we have we have done a lot of work what sort of measuring sort of the large scale organization f the brain and brin net works and that sort of very popular i dean in nur science to daysor moving away from sor what is this we have taught to lot but what the front to loves do but the fronto loves are part of these networks in the brain and and a really sort of youre the state of your networks is really important factor is well in addition to sort of your your doting your sort of neurmoduyi sort o nor chemical profile yet tell me more about this i mean you actually a premp ted my next question which as can be and it is is my favorite question asked carled de us or off taught me to asked this way back when lik what reyou most excited about now cas i know the work you have published and nd we'v and you have done a magnificent job of sharing the details of that and and work of others in a really informitive and in some cases actionable way but what what dare you hat you really excited about if if a there we are no financial barriers to your grants at cetera you had a thousand people workin what what what is the what is the thing that is hitting year dopening circuits these day well in the grand scale i'm excited that things that we have learned of the last thirty years not just in my laber your laber any one's lave is actually now being translated actually helping people i mean when people asked me what i do i samineurologists because that is at my cor what i feel i am and i feel i got into this business to to te help people an it is it is when you when you work for years and years and years and in a dozen translated it it is can be frustrating but but now i'm excited that i it seems that the things we have learned that lfas have learned and ner science o starrington now translate into someis not to something and in nerse science what sort of what is happeng last ten years we have thinking of the brain and in a kind of grandeur scale his sort of it is over all organization not focus on just this areer that aria i'm one it when i talk about the front to loves is being the most important part the the in the a conductor yes i i i am talking about one brain reagion but it it is a brain region i said that is connected to everywhere and it is because it is connected to everywhere is what is really a the essence of wyits it is important a some of the recers on excited most about a sort taking away the names of areas and just thinking about the brain as a as a a big network at alike an airoline network or or electrical network and how how different areas communicate with each other and when you think of it that way for example in airline network a you have got all these hubs all over the world all over the country in the united states for example you have got chicago is is is a hub and em and there is other hub ma walky or since a natty but they have very different functions in the network as a whole right if if you are trying to get from a new york to san francisco which happened to be many times even though you are not going through chicago if chicagoes shut down your prolegan aget delayed because su a as is huge inpact on the whole system and if m waky goes down you kdown even know it yuliriht overi'm sorry if anyone's listening for theyr ell u you are going to go through but but thinking about the brain the brain is the same way the brain has these hubs as well and and you now the prefront af quartexs is is a hub chicago it is just an important hub that keeps the whole system a ouyougoing and that is why it has much more of an inpact when you when youat you when you damageit or you stressed as suppose to an some other part of the brain and what is excitin in me is not onlys that make us thinking about disease differently because now or starn to think about how is diseases effecting these hubs that the pathology seems to be a and when you look at alsimer's disease you look its gets a frendy and you look t a lot of diseases it is not just that is some microscopic change in some nuron it seems to be effecting hubs in the brain that are affecting the whole network and we have a different target to go after for treatments wt what can we do to sort of boost a hub that is been damaged i suppose to thinking about in a in a less pecific way and then also as we'e as we have really start to learn about how the brain as organizin these networks weve vouge to learn that measuring a youre network structure is very predictive of of of your well being and how youe respond to interventions there is a metric called my gilarity which measures a how organize your brain networks are and the brain is made up of different moduls a different networks and these net works can either be very communicating with each other are not communicating with each other and and the more segurgated they are we call that more motilarity ther kind of separate entities their the modular and it turns out we can measure that with that from ri we can put soe one in o scanner we can do this resting a a from ri scanning and then we can measure how modular your brain as rs as my brain and all of us are very different levels of modularity is it more advantageous to have more modularity is supposed to less yet turns out that it seems to be more avitation have more we can predare separateness of brain ye unction between heirs yet that the networks are sort of more independent that does not mean they do not talk to each other but at at at sor base line thei'r more indepresting state conic yet if ther more their more independent as supposed to a less independent with each other not unlike a ner muscular junctions gan development are what we call polly inervated that is why babies can move their limbs but not with a lot of cordination look at a one your old trun eats pegetty for instance hilarias i look at that same kid seven months later there is lot more precision o movement largely due to removal more modularity of conconnections right right interest we we did a study where we took twelve tramatic brangury patience and measure the modularity you get a number you are just get a modulary index for each of the twelfths people and then they underwent this gomagemen training and we are able to predect who was can improve on the training that those who had more m started off more modular benefited more from the training and it is turnd out that this has been a very bus finding across studies now across different training a different young old patient populations it is also predicted things a whethere is some one in a comais more likely to do well or someone whose olders can to have a certain mount of cognan to cline or some ones we respond to beharl therpy if their opsessiv compulsives sof there is something about this brain state that not only can measure but actually is giving us inside in to the interventions that we are doing which again is going to be much more helpful and determining what helps and what does not help if we know awe now ir what the state is before we start the intervention interesting and a makes me thinkmany things but ao just focus on two of them one is i love this idea that you and others arestarting to look at bring network activity as supposed to over emphasizing the roll of say prefruntal quartacs or hippocampus understanding more that those are hubs in a larger theme of am of activation because you no fight one wish for science communication its that people would yes learn some terms dopoming in front to loaves it is important to now the noman clature but 's understand that if you really want to be able to work with the information in a way that is beneficial you ned to thing about verbs not nowns right it is about the action sates of these erias and those action states are always a involving multiplarias yet just you cannot tok about running as just quadrusep in hamstring flection and ex stension and you known contraction is is as a you can you can break it down that way and then's useful to know that but ultimately you are talking about gait and stride and things that that have a real verb action to the mand we have not had much of that for the nervous system i at it at a circit level we ben able to do that for individual nons that is the first piece and then am the second piece is that it occurs to me that there is much rich understanding of the different states of sleep you mat walker is just here recording thi series on sleep that will release slateor this year and mystages one two three four deep sleep slow wave sleep rap and i movement sleep but we do not even really have a naming am system for waking states we say focus we say tasks swhiching but those are am just names we made up a just as stage one two three and rem sleeper names that we made up but there seems to be a a much richer understanding what rapid eyed movement sleep is good for and what defisis in rapini movement sleep lead to then there is for instance how a given our network j omen to make this up calling us certain network activation state state a what we we that if you norro sciences task in a feeld of n sience now as tasks with with giving us a understanding of the verb states and what these waking states of mind are very mysterious an and for the general public this is important because people wonder is my focus poor or is it is a good is my tasks wiching ability good and we only tend to look at it are they functional enough to do their job and manage their family manage their lives we do not really have metrics but for sleep we have metrics and commercial products can measure that you'l sleep trackor rings ristbands mattriss covers that me the sort of thing well yei i think mytularity can actually be that metric some metric of of your large scale organization of your of your brin can be that metric we wee there is a number of laghs that have done this of have measured mygularity and real time what i was stalking about which jus getting a snaps out of this is what your baseline mygilarity is but we can also look at magall i have changes on a second ta second te minute te minute basis and a one of my formeposac ept tat a sotagan she just at a very simple experiment where they were noises there were sounds and the the functional myscanis very loud you you cannot hear very well but every once a while there be sound was just above the the the level of the noise of the the scanner and all you had to do a sort of a ou on't press i bone if you hard that sound and you did not pick it up all the time you maybe aiby pesend he time you heard and sometimes twenty persond times you did not hear it well she measured their moularity at a moment ta moment basis and she could predict if they were going to get that if they were ginto be correct or not in reck and and break the sound before they they got the sound if they were highly modulor whom they they they got it if thei're brain had got into this kind of you non't diffuse less mie state thet they missed it and i could definialy see as you'r talking about whereif we can develop a mogularity matric in real time on a device a this would be game changer and an that sort of what i'm weou know what ive been interested in do what is excites me is that were not gong to do with a scant obviously you cannot walk around wit a scanner in your head right and and even i do not think you even do with the g i think can we develop a proxy for mogularity with some more simple way of doing it can we extract this may be at of heart rate variability or for oxygen a i've been i've been working a wit a some collegues the o former studenta a brian miller and a a postoc of adam gazalies a west clap who have a company call nor scouting were they are able to a they have wweve been sor doing scanning and also olecting physiological data to detry and determine if there is some prot we can measure the modulare in scanner but can we pick that up in the in the physiology did i because they can collect oxygen and heart raed variability and an other metrics that bay be kind of a read out of that and then thn we would have a brain state which is what you are looking in as you are looking for some brainstate but it is not i think people are thinking were geting we need a helmet or something that we need just something simple right that reads out brainstey just the way we read out other physiological a information from our r watch or or something that will the sleep trackers of various kinds have certainly been able to pull out information about rabon i movement and other stages of sleep in min keen mattricks not every metric not what you would get with person wearing it e g a probe or something a you a set of probes but certainly information that can be used a one thing that has me a little bit perplexed a and a i'm almost reluctant to bring it up en omin to do it a is that i did a couple episodes about sylicibon and the use of am socidon for the a treatment of depression this is robing cardar harris from you see us af and i also jus solo episode emphasizing a courseis is in recreational use for talking about rting mut for treatment of depression but there is thre's a lot of ner imaging about am af patience before and after sa macerodo solicide in this is not mycrodosing and one of the major take aways is a increased resting state conactivity which by virtue of what you just describe might not be ideal for cognant function might be good for a social emotional function and i'm certainly do not want to disperage the beautiful work that is being done there but you said that increased modularity predicted improved function especially with cognive interventions a socibon seems to a induce fairly significant in increases in crossmod ol talk be in brainnewers youin other words less modularity u shoall we be concerned o it is just it has to do with how we a make these measurements and and connectivity does'n mean the same you are the different types of conectivity and i to when i think about connectivity we talki about this connected it is of of brain state and averses a brain traite when we are talking about you being highly modular as a trait ah that is very different than what your modularity is indifferent states it it actually turns out you do when you do these highly executive demanding tass you get less mot you gets less modlar becaus you have your networks are communicating is with each other it is important to be o for net works to get less modular when it is a more debanding task but that is very different then then whether what is your what is your base line modularity because it is you got to get from your your where your baseline is to this other state and a lot of it has to do us going from one state to another not not much sore the absolute sort of different says that is fas jsesthing i did not know about those results buts interesting that a that it does a fact sir connectivity in that way i think the drugs out ar going to be helpful ar gan a argan a promote sort of tat works talking to each other as oppose o networks not communicating with each other in your clinic do you ever combine drug therabese cogne of training and things transcranial magnetic stimulation do you use stimulators yes i think i have a lot of patience that have referred for a for it is approved yuse which is depressions i'm very excited about sort of the the work that is being done with it as a as a for depression but we have not really had any improve o anything that is been for you do not for cognition ther der bunch of studies and do small studies where you can give transgraing max conventon t frontal quartixon working memory improve but they really have been done in ways iter we do not know if it generalizeis if it is if it is going to be how the way it is been done in depression in a way that can really be but i but again it is just a matter of doing it i think it will be part of the things we do drugs to yem as and all the other things we have talk about is not just going to be one one thing any eny gets back to networks right what this is doing is really changing how nows the h interaction a regions is not about sor of jus increasing o decreasing activity in som mysterious part of the brain is this sor restoring the balance of a of of a network we mark i really wont to thank you you you can given us an amazing tour of a presily five feeld irea lot ave you as a neurologist but the way i'm i slightly reluctant do this but am amanatill you joke tat was told to me a that the're these people stranded on an island an dum there they are really stock and the're running out a resources and dum by the ay this joke was told to me by a physician and all a sudden this hot air balloon and comes over and the only goingto say they tart they write help in the sand and they and dum hot air balloon directly over them cam descends almost almost to them and dum and then some one in the hot air balloon says i'm doing the measurement and it is exactly seventy six feet down to those people and then the hot air balloon takes off and goes away and the people on the beach one of whom's o physicion in eos those were naurologis i tell that j because that was the old school view of naurology that am neuralogist were great t describing things talking about the terrible conditions they could observe in great detail but that they a did not do anything about it you on the other hand and i'm gussing others in the field but certainly you have proven to day that ye that joke needs to be revise whereby thereis one at least one naurologos who castle lying down

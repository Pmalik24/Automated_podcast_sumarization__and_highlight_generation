jobidon visits veatnom where he assures the world he has no interest in containing the chinese the geeslen y refuses to contnem russh over its invasion of you cran and ho mex goes governor says to hell with the second memet i'm bentsuur of the sisventpuro show the benshkir sho responser by expressve pian protect your amine privacy todaye express vepianda com sleshmen it is very easy to get caught up in the horse race and because agan we are in a presidential pree year the presidential year used to start in twenty twenty four but now stretches the full year beforehand its only september of the prior year and we are already in full horse race mode but it is easy to forget that the presidency actually matters it is not just about all of the lights and the whistles it is also about can you be the president of the united states and do a good job and jobidn continues to prove that he is not capable of this over the weeken jobidn wen to hanoi veanom his strategy in veatnom was to apparently attempt to create some sort of division between veitnom in china it is essentially at containment strategy and this a strategy that has been pursued him by parsan fashion by every president for the last ten or fifteen years the basic idea is you get japan and sout corea and veatnom and all the countries that surround china to basically create a counterweight to china and box them in such that america has allies surrounding china in pretty much every direction that that least is the strategy and that requires some delicate diplomacy because the fact is that china is a very aggressive country and under gesian pang and increasingly aggressive country it ould also require that the chinese have a littlebit of fear that the american president is actually going to stand by his ward that the american president is actually somebody weas going to stand up for a particular lin hat f a line is drawn and that line is cross that the americans are shigan n do something about it well that is rather undercut when the president of the united states is feeble and there is no question about this jobidens feeble his entire team put out a schedual of his events yesterday to day he apparently was going to be in veatnom yesterday and over the week en he flew there and he hata bevy of events had got io plane and he haded to alaska for the september eleventh memorial event anowisan alaska for for the september eleven memorialmen does make any sense to me last i checked i mean i was there for september eleventhan and are you izhim and you recall that it had literally nothing to do with laska but some for some reason jobidnes conmealaska for september eleventh because why the helmot and and this was proof of his verality this is proof that he was he was somebody who is durable and he was going to be somebody who can stand up to the rigers of the jobbler's only one problem by the time he had beanom dubsslyp and he juststatislep the entire trib for example jobidon staff had to cut him off in the middle of a sentence because he does not know where he is he started wandering on the stage no one knows what he is doing here we toabooboveroabo oobomecuetur nnter av access totin av ace wew was not perfentates or all no everybody etteveryon on y up tinkly piano play him off is it is it is the tonies now he is getting a war this 'm sorry your time is up mister president do do do just get the tincais gat kennagy in the corner with the sasxipo jobidon also said in themiddle of this press conference that he was going to bed which his always a great indicator of just the the absolute vitality of the presidency here here was jobi an explaining that he is going to sleep i do not the anyway i just think that ther other things or leaders wors an the respond o what tethe tern l nobody ivy soubrated youaper mes i you do not know what you wore a the me if you do not have a gain he may have a ga ye just hascuro me ut i ta wan on abo you i'm going to going to tet i what a ve very encouraging stuff there from the president of the united states wo apparently is capable of allowing a sound to emerge from his mouth only once every five or six seconds before he has to tell people that he is ready for his bedy buy his warm cup of mill and a big big hug from his night nurse presumably his pres secretary that that is that is insane stuff but here is the problem for jobidon he is bad at the job it is not just that he is physically feeble which he is or that he is mentally feeble which he has kind of always been in he is just more now the problem with jobidones that his policies our garbage and we have a gressive enemies to day is in fact september eleventh there are many lessons we should have learned on september eleventh and that we have busily spent last twenty years all morning one of those big lessons is forein policy actually matters hat actually has consequences and that if you do not have a little but of foresight the consequences can be disastrous now you foresight we did not have in the nineteen nineties is that if we did not stop al kita in its tracts in nineteo ninety igt when they bombed the embassies in tentinea and cenya that that would come back to haunt americize all kita grew at matastisize and would end with thedeath of three thausan americans on nine eleven c what we are tong moutright now onan or it is is ors o magnatude larger if you do not stop the chinese government in its tracts when it comes to its a gressive instincts we are not talking about no three thousand americans that which was the worst tragedy on american soil since the second world war you are talking about a full scale conflagration whith the largest physical army on plan at earth america has the best arman plane earth most technologically venced our mam plan earth but if you do not stop the chin es people bumble their waight into war because of mis interpretation they think the other side is weaker than it is most wars in the modern eara get started exactly the way the war but tween russian you crane got started russia misinterpreted signals from the west that they would not do anything if your crane was invaded and the mis interpreted ou cranes military strength and then they invaded and now we are now in in year two of a long war that is killed hundreds of thousands of people those sorts of mis interpretations r r created by failurs of communication and jo bidon cannot communicate he is not capable of this and meanwhile gisian pang is becoming more and more aggressive is entire stratitue with regard to china is quite frightening not because it is bound to be successful an make china stronger but because it is bound to make china actually weaker and thus more aggressive i've talked about this before china has massive probins we didn a ou to vidous syou check out in our serious fact rit talk about the big pribms the china has but they include things demographic china is completely demographically upside down they do not have enough young people tas hou provide the labor force or the earning force to pay for all of the debt they have taken out speakin of which their debt is extraordinary if yo ushould take into account all the publican private debt that dave in curred the is no such thing as a real private sector everyting is back by the government over there your talk about a country that is up to its eyeballs in dat

event the y twenty summit but china's seshian ping deem did not worth his time his absence sents a stark signal china is done with the established world order tiching the summit marked to dramatic turn in chinas form policy for he pass several years she has apparently soutz make china and alternative to the west now she is positionig his country is a full on opponent ready to a line it is own block against the united states its partners and international institutions they support she is break wiat the establishment has been a long time coming heis predecessors integrated china into the us led globel order by joining its foundational institutions the world bank and the u t o for much of his tenar over the past ecade she has kept a foot in the door to the western order even as china's relations with the us have the teriorated china even participated though grudgingly in g twenty efforts telp alleviate det burdens on struggling low in come countries but over the course of his rule she his now grown hostile to the existing order he is intent on altering it he is fokis on developing alternative institutions basian could lead in control hes form the ision in for structiron vestmen bank ts rival the world bank he is promoted competing international forms the shanghi cooperation organization whos membership includes russia and ar on he is gen a stick around at the uen because obviously he thinks he can militorize it but the g twenty is not one of the places where he is actually fluxing his influence because heuld to undercut the g twenty the map controversy suggestsd g'sn sh's at nationalist pursuit of global power could under mine as pushd to lead a new block against the wast because h is taking off by the way the indians for example but he sees the united states as his chief global opponent this s being high lit over the weeken by the fact that china went on high alert after justin canadian ships went through the time on straiht according to the asionas fross press china set on saturday that its strips were un constan high alert after two ships belonging to t ussin canada cransited through the time on straight according to a military spokes person this by the way is one reason why the united states cuting back its military aboutch at particular and the navy is idiotic in the extreme it is true the united states has the world's most powerful navy by longshit it is allso true that the united states requires the world's most powerful navy because many of the shipping lanes that are easy choke points for our enemies our very very far away from us china ois not require a deep water navy in order challege the united states all they require is what hey all a gray water navy in order to insure that thacan basically control the tiwon straight the time on stright is right their back yard it is not in our back yard obviously it this is is a problem for us you would imagine that strong american leadership would be something worth while whell meanwhile jobidon he is out their sayingthings i do not want o containe china i dn't want to contain what why not i seriously why not why would you not want to contain china i understand that were sort of pussy footig around this hollissia with china but the reality is the g is not and taking a more aggressive posture toward china sanglason the way that your reghime is currently it is currently attacking the rest of the world with it soft power and sometimes with hard power e's not acceptable to the united states enng to build up our military and we are not going to allow youe to use your expansionism to threaten american interest which do include places tiwan here jotan out wood woulds reid about bidns that he is he sickneis compl ly con fused approach from time to time he will say things if time want is attacke a mericabile defend which as i've said before is attually not a terrible thing to say ivings hasshe the right thing to say but it wuld require an actual dedication to a military budchit capable of supporting that kind of brash talk bidon's talk on foreign policy is generally empty words followed by very little else and this creets very sticky situations as we will ee when it comes t ou crane the second here is jobidonshing he oesn't want to contain china gets o i mean all of that hee does one to contain china that i do not know what he thinks he means by that i really non't he was invyanom specifically to conchan china we should note here a the he that is why he is there bidns had in news conference to day we can trace a fiftyer arc of progress in the relationship between our nations from conflict to normalization he is talking to the a general secretary of the cominis party in veanom he says thiis a new elevated status that will be a force for prosperity an security in one most cons quential regions in the world there is only one problem of course which the vanom is also a line with the russians literally over the week en veanom is chasing a secret russian armsteal even as to deep ento merican ties in order for america to have a big umbrella america has to have a very strong umbrella that strong umbrella has to include things making sure that if we think that veonom is is actually going to be weaponized against china it does not by its weapons from the russians who are allies of the chinese all this would be a lotless complicated if he united states actuit tok a muscular approach to the world but jobin does not have a muscular proach the worlds he says he does but then he does not fill in the gaps this also true when it comes you crane will get to that in one second first everybody knows i love ma heliks mattress have you checked out their most high and collection the helicks eleap helics as harnest years of exstensive

offer yet it is ikin last long with helics better sleep starts right now gets o when it comes to jobidons forign policy confusion and mix signals the s ame thing holds truith regards you crane just a spell out what the united states should be doing in you crane it is been perfectly obvious since nearly the beginning of the war that this thing was going to end in e stale mate because it was going to end in a stalemate in made a lot of sense for the united states to basicaly go to the russians and say you are going to keep cremia youreging to keep parts of the nonbas wergan gives security guarantees to ou crane and everybody can go back stabsqualanty that was always what the deal shoul ave been tit was always what the deal was going to be the united states this does have an interest in degrading the russian military and the truth is the money that we have spent in ou crane contro public opinion that money as actully ben money fairly well spent we have degraded the russian military dramatically thay no longer have the capacity to cross other country's borders thet threat tonato has been tremendously mitigated which is good forour allies in the region and by the way a lot of the money tht we have spent is in fack coming back to us because proof of the use of those weapons on the battle field means for example that over the week end o poland announce thatitwas goingto spend about ten billion dollars in terms to buying american military armaments yet all that can be true and still there needs to be an all framp here because hundreds of thousands of people are dying in a war and the borders are not moving very much and every cu sikg mat ou crnian break through uket when when it happens than all believe it but basical you have to chroiceis one is you arm the u cranians to the poin where they are capable of actually just defeating the russians throughout u crane which would mean presumably giving them things ot sucteines or you are not cunto do that which case you should be looking to cut some sort of deal but instead the united states and its allices of cutsort this half way measure where they say se lensk's gon to lead the negotiations which means no piece cause the lensky is an sendivised by his people correctly not to give back in inch of land and meanwhile the russians have no insente of to lieve because there not being physically forced out of donbas or cremia and what thy can do just retreat for no reason and the things just can go on and on and on meanwhile the longer it goes on the less support the united states gen a halfe for this thing going on for prolonge periods of time russia for example which is part of the g twenty they hailed the g twenty as a success according to sianen russia on sunday deemed the g twenty summit in indias capital of new delly in un conditional success a day after the meanings final declarations stopped short of explicitly condemning its invasio of you crane speeking at oppress confrente at the end of the summit russian for a minister surgay lavrov said the summit was as success not just for indya but for all of us the final group statements had quote all states must refrane from the threat ore use of force to seek territorial acquisition but it did not single out russia the statemen ac knowledge quote there were different views an a sessments of the situation u crane then criticized the g twenty's final declaration you cranes form ministryes spokes person wrote on face boot ou crane is grateful to its partners who tried to includes strong wording in the taxts at the same time the g twenty has nothing to be prout of in the fact that russa's a grussian against youcran continues obviously the participation of thou cranianside ould hav allowed the participance to better understand the situation the principale of nothing about you cran without you rane remains as key as ever meanwhile antony blinkin is trying to pretend that this water down statement is actually something positive and good yours ansony blink an trying to explain the sujectapper god is thign ificantly weaker language then last years jorined statemen whic's called for russias quote complete and un condition ar withdrawal on quote from you crane wat why did you us agree to all water down declaration that does not even can don russia by name or explicitly call for russia to leave you crane je the je twenty countries in the statement all stood up for the importance to teritoil integrity sovereignty ah and tat's very clear i was in the room when i all the leaders spoke to day with with present biden aand it was very clear from everythin that they said a that a not only they want to see thi qoren bhat they want to see at end on just en durable terms and it was also very clear that the consequences of russias siggression our being felt throughout of the thethe twenty countries and throughout the developing world c this is all amus it is all amessontomess because this ad ministration is extremely messy when it comes to china are they aggressive or are they conciliatory when it comes to russia are they aggressive or are they weak what exactly is it ther at tempting to do nobody has she explain what the what they want the final product to look when when it came to brounds ragins approach the sovia union his approach was very simple we win they lose now they could be negotiation within that framewor but the framework was you are our enemy we are going to aggressively confront you in this fer until you bend when it comes to china we refuse to take that view because again we have integrated our economy with theirs which is one of the world's worst worst measures by the way you can actually understand why we were doing that from seventies up through eighty nine but aftertinnamen square there is no excuse whatsoever for the west trying to integrate its economy with china the economic liberalization of china which was partial in the extreme never amounted to political liberalization of china and meanwhile throughour to russia were sending mix signals as well as on the one hand we are not providing you crane the support necessaried actually win in you graine but at the same time we are telling them you are leading the negotiations interminable war that is what all of this means and longer this goes on it does not favor democracies by the way autocracies our favored by long wars why at because very often when it comes to long warswe see nafganistan or rock democracies lose faith in these wars they do not them democracies you wake them up and we get really tough that we get really big and really strong very quickly and then we mass yu but if we do not mash you pretty fast in autocrac can out live you because he is not changing ad ministration all it takes for american form policy to swivel on a dime as new election everyone knows this and 's just a matter of outlasting the other got bet the tome a vionom or rock or afganistan the only wars america wind successfully our wars that are pursuit in very short rurder with very clear objective and were you use the amount of force necessary to achieve that objective those are the only wars america winds and those are also the only wars america prevence is wer we make clear t everybody if you cross ex line wewill smack you hard you will be living in the stone age that and then you can negotiate within that framework but we are not cano even c me close that line if you come close to that line we are gan a nok your head off diplomacy is always the velvet glub it that if there is no iron fist inside the velve glove what is it matter when you are vacillating whn you are wavering when ofre being deliberately on clear or may be not deliberately unclear what exactly's ever one supposed to take away from your behavior and just once sicon will get to the aryo where jobidon believes he actually does have international unity an international leadership first how often do you pray wel the answer is probably not often enough i am n orthodox tou the means that i pray three times today when it comes to the big hallidays coming up to be more than three times a day honestly without the prayer my day would be pretty unliveable because you need to commune with the divine to give you a sense of purpose yeu've a sense of comfort and all the rest well if you having a hard

months free at hallodot comslash apara that is hallo dot com slash chipero of gat when it comes to the thing that jobidon believes he has unity on it of course is not you craneet of course is not china he thinks that he can create global wedership on lobel warming well this is always nonsense whenever somebody says that they are going to forge global leadership on lobel warming it is absolute nonsense it is a it is a tossaway line to the left china are not participating russia are not participating india are not participating and guess what long as they are pomping carbon into the atmosphere we have been lowering our carbon emissions and the're goin to keep increasing them because they are in competition with us this notion of global cooperation against a against a force globell warming it is not going to happen and who is jobidon speaking to hen he says things global warming is an excestential risk who is he talking to thisan it is a convenuay of ambashing is domestic political opponents becaus he is not cone to say this directly to the chinese the chinese will just lyin continued doin what the're doing here is jobidan tung my global warming over in vionom we i again when when you are indowbt an you have nothing else left to go to if you are on the left the place that you goes globe warming because it is an unbeatable enemy and the real enemy tha you are at tempting to beat e's ou're political domestic opponents which is why chopidn again he is he is out of it he is out of it to yesterday he was again gl ing o off on what he called climates an irs and he again brings up this lying dog faced pony soldier routine dud getna new frame of reference mis amazing lis the sampartywords our form policyes in struck in the ineteen eighties your president is stuck in the eighteen eighties here we go youso mis tei sa e comlee will take car ree we god ae co e e woks the cawe points to the e mos ec hes a lor dog face pony solder oon do face ponyspors about therebo abou gorry wor we warn oofu oris s what is this creepy old man whispering about what is h even talking about by the way this is not in fact from a john wanmovy its from apparently a tirone power fleck called pony soldier from nineteen fifty two which if your frame of reference is nineteen fifty two you should not be presiden any more 's can point that out to you mak nineteen fifty two with seven years after the end of world wore to oge i i i was personally born fort two years after this movi came out that he is currntly referencing and i's not because you to watch old these is bus he watch this in the theatrs i'm not kitting jobidon was born in the year nineteen forty two he was ten when pony soldier came out a gashe watch this with his family i'm shore in the theatere in scran pennsylvania in nineteen fifty two ju this is how crase this is i'm thirty nine or solticate joba lak simple math would suggest jobidon as one nineteen ighty for jobine was born forty two years before i was born forty two years that is two generations before was born and he is still the president this entire generation needs to leave the political stage go go enjoy the rest of your retirement please but of course the idea that that all o his political opponents hare theroute of all eval because they'r quotical climate an ires t you note i noticed i note tha the climates and ires in the united states are not in fact the problem bhet i notice is that it is the regimein china that actually is the probably you do not have the balls to stand up to those peoples instead what areyou doing your trying to cramate down on americans for no apparent reason which by the wayis woing down with more economic turmoil as fok's news reports presiden jobines ad ministration fanalized plans for a program at argues will further educe air pollution from heavy duty engines and vehicles across the united states truckers argue that the proposed standards will crush the supplithin and puts the american food supply risk the new omission standards put forth by the e p are significantly more strention that cover a wider range of heavy duty engine operating conditions compared to previous standards the rule officially went into affect march twenty seventh of this year it is can be implemented for new truck sold after twenty twenty seven but truckers are saying that

while tobidon is jobbering to the viitomes about how his political opponents at home are climate and irs he is rade to crown down on you expenantially higher food prices all to make himself feel better because again is on can amitigate globe warming in any real way all that globe warming is happening right now if you believe in man made globe warming thanks to china in india mewile tobidn's aconomy continues to exist right on the threshold of of a major major problem at the very least we are now in a period of economic stagnation youre seeing this in the size of the peos that are curnently happening initial public offerings are very often a measure of the durability and sort of the sor the explosiveness of the american economy well right now all of the ipo valuations are dropping instacart is cornently targoning valuation roughly eight poin six billions of to nine point three billion in its i po in in two thousand and twenty one het was raising money at he thirty nine billion dollar valuation instacart now part of that is because twenty twenty twenty twenty one lotof people are buying the instacart because of covi and all the rest of the sort of stuff but part of this is because there is just lotlast loose money lying around i know a lot of companies have been thinking about ipoi no their looking at the market and her sang i'm not going to ipo i'm not kin ta go public because i just coun't raise enough money in the public markets to make tot worth my while the company's stock market da bu according to the walster journals of bell weather for the ipeo market muted for much of this yeure and last it will be closely washd by investers of bankers lawyers and trators we will follow the highly anticipated offering by british chip desin or arm elti d we sures aue expected to da bu this week in the biggest us ipo of the year and again instacart is an excellent company an my wife us insticart all the time the fact that excellent companies are now lowering their ipeo expectations by a factor of four over the qr s last to years ad ho tell you something about the state of the markets and meanwhile on comes to jobidan all the hunter bidn stuff his still lingering over him because the reality is that the hunter joe relationship is extremely corrupt it is been corrupt for thirty years thre's nothing new under the sun here the yeur time sardy trying it is latest cover up and all about how much jobidon loves his son jus trup much love katy rogers wearlie or the summer president bide was feeling hopeful his son hunters wors had struck a pleadsel with federal prosecutors on taxing gun charges it semd tothe president the long legal ordeal would finally be over but when the agreement collapsed in late julive mister bidin his public immage offen belies him or mercurial temperament was stunned he plunged into sadness an frustration according tos several people lose to him who spoke on condition of anninimity since then his tone in conversations about hunter has been tinged with the resignation tha was not there before his confiounde say now was the just his pimen plans to indite hunter on gun charge in the coming weeks white house advisers are preparing fror many more month of re publican attacks and the prospect of a criminal trial in middle of the twenty twenty four presidential campaign republicans have casttrum the hunters troubles as he stew of nepitism and corruption which the bide administration to nides but there is no doubt the hunter case is a drained politicallean emotionally and his father and those who wish to see him reelected oh the sad old man that is really the story heres is it is sad is sit he just wanted to be a delightful father jest wanted to be a loving father which is why he was sending his son to forein countries topick up bags of cashon geting on the phone with for an oligarchs in order to help him achieve those bags of cash accordig to the yor times as his father and brothers share to talen fore public service hunter in vision himself as the financiers supporting the family business of politics for a time it was worked thet made him proud because it made him feel needed datcades later though he was known to complain about the responsibility a person close to hunters that those complains are exaggerated expressed at a time when hunter was feeling bruise of of course therecn to say that because if you point out that hunter axtly texat his own daughter that he pays half of pop's bills it sounds a little more corrupt the whole thing of course this whole article is bat how how terrible it is for jobied in that his son is really is really screwed up president bidon tries to keep his son close when hunter accompanied the president on a trip to ireland in the spring he traveled on aire forse one and slept on a cottonis father's hotel room when hunter flies to washington from his home in malibo who stays ot the white house sometimes for weeks at a time i'm his security blanket hunter told the new yorker in twenty nineteen allies of the presidents have deep respect for the bond but have privately priticize bi dans apparently in ability to say no when

meanwhile apparently the governor of new mexico is under the weird misimpression that th constitution does not apply in new mexico mexhell governor mischell luchan grisham has is now announced that dom she has issued n emergency order subspending the right tho carry firearms in public across albakirky and the surrounding county for at least thirty days in respons to a spate of gun violins that is going to te associate o press she said she expects legal challengeis but she was compelled to act because of recent shootings including the death ohen eleven yor old boy outside a minorly baseball stadium this week luchan grisham said state police would be responsible for amounting what in for enforcingwhanamount to civil violations bata the albokerky police siev vizarity saying i'm notkonen force that this is this on constitutional here is the new mexico governor claiming that emergency powers give her the ability to simply subspend constitutional law e la herey i won we wan exception and that is it theres an a mergen y and i declared in emergen sy for temporary in our time i can in bo indisional power no constitutional i ind my you oncluding my own is intended to be afulwe her re fictions or tre fe ther erfictions on my freedom in dise mergen sy it is a wetin youre all and al we here to watolesien ha diser my intention te how the debate about wether or in emergnsy we can create a sate for environment it is want aout there constitutional riht on this is when people say political fashios am this would be it o ka went when a when he member the government simply declares ve emergency order that they can violate rilly milly constitutional rights full scale constutional rights based on no actual emergency can weare not talking here about a tornado is hitting the state we are not talking here about there is some sort of giant earthquake there is no emergency here this is just her saying i do not the people got shot therefore i'm banding you from exercising her constutional rights this bit you could do this for anything but she could sayleson we have a national epidemic of hate you see this by the way in places chicago where the former mayor lawyer lightfoot try to declare that racis most public health emergency you could see somebody this idiot governor saying rasism hate their public health emergency and i'm declaring emergency therefore you are not allowed to say the following words in my state and then juslits them off thabe pretty significant first amen in violation or she co go even further presumably she could just say ou're not allowed to use the internat because the innernet obviously has facilitated much violence you are just not allowed to use it any more i've decided in my state that you are not allowed to use that not on the basis of any sort of yelected legislative session but on the basis of her own judgment that n emergency has now bic constue cause she does not the thing that is happening welfh all of your rights are simply dependence on one lady deciding that she really does not the things tha are happening in the world that is tyranny that is the essence of tyranny andi's amazing the sheu would try this but it was always going to happen imen the minute that we shot down everything in the world for covit and ten we maintain tat for two years even as the data emerge that it action was not the sort of national emergencye that was being suggested it was only matter of time before democratic officials tribe to do something this it really was by the way i'm i'm to take something i i almost never say which is points to tad loo ted loo i men again credit oure credit is to ted loo said i support gon safety laws however this order from the governor of no mexico violates through us constitution no state in te union can suspend the federal constitution there is no such things o state public health emergencye exceptions to the united states constitution why men that is a welcome change and then ta even david hog who is one of the world's larger idiots i and got into harvard university on the basis of his movements about gun can ral even they hog who is been wrong about nearly everything ever he says i support gun safety but there is no such thingas as state public helth emergency exception to the us constitution that good good i mean leke i'm glad that there there are starting to realize that now we will see how brawly they ar plabe's again if this is the new way the democras make law then you could do it on base of anything a jobidon andthe rest of the democrats have declared that climate change is the greatest emergency facing humanity period i's greater than than covi the newclear ward than anything the greatest emergency facing humanity is according to them that the plan is getting warmer by a few degrees and thus what could not they justify in the name of all of this well the mexican then the ne mexican governor lushangrisham she is saying that violators could face civil penalties and a fine im up to five thousand dollars under the order residents can still transport guns to some private locations a gunrage or gun store but the firem has have a trigger lock or some other container or mechanism making him possible to discharge that there is no way this remotely stands up in qort there ist no way it it it remains amazing to me that the same people who declared that rule of was deeply important o them many of them are going to ignore this and and look the other way ind pretenden it does not matter the januor six ass an assault on the rule of law that it overthrew constitutional warms well i mean how but just ignoring the constitution entirely as the mexican governor is doing pretty amazing stuff over there can meanwhile donald trump was an iwa back to the horse race donald trump was was over in iwal over leegens to his ron to santis and dum it sort of mixeto reactions i would say trump visited an iwa frat the frat was naturally quite warm to him heare some the vidia catin sanding howistons over their for him iu do not ats the tro i'm goin good anow o tig bot tothis is som mi turn out i guess the youth strump but we la iwa wit just left sout the gote less tatter is an amazing evening we got o wonderful in ter spen thers onout from the governor t were here in this reception spinin trout c kcinden to go over to the ya ave the borbir culd pi thro te the gorgers on at looks an anacor the yonerger shot of tha that is a glis wag is trun trump doing some some retail politics which you knon't good for him i he also went to the iwa football game and thereis bit if on line contrversy'sh broke out over whether he is been booed or whether he is being cheered to here sort of the raw footage and as you will hear the answersome abouth eininin hearer dow he won ten is when he went down intan scan to spend most of the game not in the stancy went no uwasin for re luxury box whe wer flipping him off in all the rest of it but you see there a bunch of enthusiastic people there in iwa as well which of course is not shockhe did win iwa in the last election cycle latest poles trum iwa are shwing trump up big time the iwa state civixs pole that was released just a few days ago has trump up thirty seven points over the rest of the field the enbyseen news tom when registere pole has trump up twenty three poins over the rest of the field in iwa now iwa is netoriously fickle you recall it very rarely has the iwa coks winner actually beenthe person who went on to win the nomination in fact the last time the n iwa caukus winner in the republican party went on to win the nomination was two thousand when george shoby bush narrowly defeated steeve forbs forty one o thirty one in two thousand twelve is rick sand torum who of course was not the nominy in twhenty sixteen it was ted cruws of course was not the nomina now what happens in iwa trump is more vulnable and iwa but as non con be enough for any one to defeat him in iwa maybe that creates the im pression that the god bleeds a little but but that is really not weare all of the heavy lifting is going to be done the same thing by the way is true in new hampshire new hampshire also has a spotty history of actually nominating presidents nineteen ninety six papyou canon youremember when the new hampshire primary and he did not winning the nomination bobdolla and it up winning the nomination in two thousand john mc kain on the new hampshire primary thrwing scare into george shall be bush in two thousand eight mc kain who is very popular nw hampshire one maromney did win intwo thousand twelve and trump one in twenty sixteen but it is a bit of spotty record in new hampshire it someny win's iwa and new hampshire that is gon throw scare into donald trump but really trumps last stand if he worge showning vulnoability in wriht nout the zull speculative considering his leaning by leaps on bounds in both of those states would be south carolina south carolina is been entirely predictive of the republican nomine every year but two thousand twelve in to thasinate it was mc ain in two thousand was george sholl by bushi on ninety six it was dole in nineteen eighty eight it was georgey shall be bush nineteen eihty t was ragan again right now it is kenma moot point has trump is leading in all of those states wit that said if he is going to show von nherability obviously the placstrican a first see it not only in terms of calenders but whos poles is going to be iwa were other candidates are spending an alful lot of time speaking of the republican hopes in twenty twenty for according to na cone over at the nor times to one of the probins for republicans is that the supposed electoral college advantage the republicans enjoy which is the way that they have one a few presidential elections twenty sixteen two thousand at tho those electoral college advantages meaning that there is certain states where by winning a a a slight majority that able to pull off a narrow victory that seems to be disappearing according to na cone of the yor times the early poles show donal trump and presen biden tide nation wides that mean trump has a clear advantageinte battlegrund states that decide thelectoral college is its e reasonable questions when i see quite often in is first two presidential campaigns trump fared far better in the battle ground states than he did nation wide but there is a case the the elec toral college advantage has fated in th mintrom elections last fall democrats farred about the same in the crucial battle ground states as they did nation wide over the last year state poles and a compilation of mork times at siana college surveys have shown bydon running as well or better in the battle grounds as thas nation wide but the results by state broadly mirroring the midterms and other words the the purple states are getting more purple is not the purple states are red and blue states or more blue which is how you actually win these narrow elections s that purple states aregetting more purple to blue and that red states are just getting more red that that is a bit of a problem again when you look at the battle ground states they they voted more similarly to the united states in general in twenty twenty two than they did back in twenty twenty for example in wats consin in twenty twenty over all the they they voted at a at a deep pluss five rates in the twenty twenty election anta and then in the house votes they voted almost even re publicans in democrats the popular vote did not reflect exactly the sort of electoral vote but that gap is basically shrinking now and you'r nyou'e taryingto see that over and over and over ththe the gap is shrinking that is a real probem for republicans as he points out democrats held their ground in battle ground states allowing them for ten i send it nearly hold the house nationally re publican house candidates when the most votes by about two per centage points the martin is almost identical in the presidential battle groundslike arizon a pennsylvania and wisconsin where re publican house candidates also one by a couple of points another words ore the national numbers are more reflective are are more reflected now in the battleground states that is not something that' can help trump obviously now it is possible tht cun be false but you are banking against whatever numbers you have that i'll sat again itis it certainly possible that all the numbers are wrong and that they are off it is also possibleth they are not and it oes worth while taking all of that into consideration i've been looking i alot of the poles recently in some of the poles that are very positive to republican contenders ire relying on a couple of things tat i think are very likely to not materialized during the atural election one is minority voters coming in at fifty four thirty eight for example for bidon republicans are considering that means hey look tha means bidon is gon a win only fifty four per cent ofthe vote no what it means republicans rigan when thirty eight per cent the vote the sealing on re publican support is in that pole it is not that the rest of tat support is going to go to republicans or even that is split evenly because remember once again fifty four pluss thirty eight is ninety two that is eight per cent of the vote still outstanding that is not con split four four re publican demograd which means that the gap is can be much larger the other gap that i think is goin to be much much rectified is a lot these pulls right now are are rooted in lack of democratic enthusiasm that is true because they are very unenthusiasti about your bid it is also true that one donald trumps on the ballat aft we have had twelve months of coverage of his supposed criminal foibles democrats are gon a crawl of er blote brokein glast ofokanstrump at's sus reality h gets out turn out for democratsto gets hout turn out for republicans ideally if you are re publican what you want is who lower turn out for democgrats and increase turn out for yourself domal trump increases turn out for both you are right now for example thar the recent sean and pole that showed trump and biding dead even have the democratic enthusiasm at sixty one per cent an the re publican enthusiasm in seventy one per cent i do not think that maintains for te entirety of the election cycle okaestime for somethings i likein than some things that i hate things i over the we gan bred lanel shrivers new novel should we stay or should we go a lanel striver is one of the best living novelist she is really terrific a lot of for work his excellent i shoe'd most famous probably for on for her book that was made into a movy of the same in name starring told us swinten' we need to talk about keavan o this one should we stay or should we go that the premise is there is a couple at fifty one and the woman's dad has died of allteimers iand he talks about how much they suffered during his last years because is very dificult to care or apparent with ellstimers and she in her husban make a packs that on their eightieth birthday theyare going to commint suiside together and very very dark sort of premis but then what the book does is in various chapters it sort of spells out iterations of what happens naxt the hit eighty did the side to do it is id not do s one deside to do it the other decides not to what happens if there is some sort of magical medicine that is created that reverses to aging and how does that in pack life it is a wildly creative and really interesting book and iis all rooted in the secular modern notion that the only thing that matters on this planet is sort of t life you have on this plan and otherwars higher purpose can only be divined by you it is only something at is internal to you and you can see how that does not work out to really any advantage throughout the course of boklic toe one the one part of the one chapter that linell shriver did not right because lanell shriver is in religious person she is just quasi consermative on a bunch of ishes but she is not a religious person lanel triver never writes the chapter where the couple actually fines religion how dos that impact ther decision making process it is it but but it is a fascinating book in its spells out a lot of the sort of qualms that secular modernism faces oka other things that i jok ofitch no vatjoke of itch thethe tennis player he is the greatest of all time there is no question i it is not just that he is in amazingly skilled player you can make a case that rogerfider was more skilled player in a lotaways then novack jok ovitch but no vatjok ovitch is most determine player i've ever seen maybein any sport he as jordinesk levels of determination there is an amazing thing that he does if yif you watch his matches where there comes a point where he almost just hones an nees i'm just done here i'm noi'm not going to allow the other the other person to win he on his twenty fourth major at vew us open over the weekain it was is an incredible thing no vatjok that i would have at least another three majors where not for the fact that he was band from participating in majors for abat a your an a half for not taking the bacts and why shuld he have taken the vacts he is thirty six years old and he is in the best shape of any living human being it is a sord to thing that he was going to be killed or significantly injured by cobin just it is it is ridiculous thing he he did not he remains in excellent shape and at the age of thirty six he is beating guys who are almost literally half his age he one last night over deno medvadev who a he he beat in i in a couple other majors in h recent pass six three seven six six three a here is libit o thefootage ti you you s thirty a the lorin tok o m nat's point to j to number twenty four the relot os shots hhighly a practful here is the fin i love that there is e mdurna or

probably another forfive his just that good if unless his body breaksdown ardy one thing i hate to day an obviously the situation morocco is terrible for for thosewho ave been following there was a very very large earthquake as six plain eight magnitude earthquake in morocco at least two thousand people have died more than twenty four hundred have ben injured three days of morning have declared

extraordinarily privileged to live in a first worl country living in an extraordinarily wealthy country means that when a disaster hits very few people dive i remember being in california during the northwridge earthquake and the northwarde earthquick f nineteen ninety for was a was a large earthquake those a six point seven res this one as sixplainagtes slightly larger than ae northwidge earthquake it was it was frightening the total death tolds fifty seven and that was way back in nineten ninety four and that those almost three dackates ago at this point and a and still i gan that that is the privilege of living in a first world country where people actually build for the possibility of disaster an's reminder that when disaster strikes countries that are much much poorer the

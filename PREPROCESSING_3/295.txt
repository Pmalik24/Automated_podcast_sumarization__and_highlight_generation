the library or the county recorter's office or it is a newspaper i think i may have been in love with her now she is too young i was never in love wih her not in that way it is just that i wanted

ran the not no sincde stuck here whan i had to eat the foot thank you for you time this is joly joly he was eighteemen he recorted that story his frendjake was sixteen if we just turning in is is thismerican life we have tossed out our regular way of doing a show this wek trashed it thucked it spurned it we laughe at it we spit on its grave and instead we are bringing as many short stories as we can fit anto sixtyminutes is bairely what eighteen minutes into the shellin al ready we are at act seven and in credible achievement it seven up with the air is clear we have this story from johnthan goldsden before he ever moved to gotham city before he grew into the overwaged obsessive sad sack of his later years the penguin was a poet and a dandy who lived in london he wrote complex villanels and through lavish dinner parties at which he only became more charming the more he drank he wore a monicle a top hat and carried in umbrella one evening at one of his dinner parties after hours spent sipping absent the penguin ran up to the roof of his building opened up his large black umbrella and leapt off into the year as he coasted to the ground and hollered out lines from blake stuff about grabbing life by the fat of its stomach and giving it its wwist he was that crazy he was that bursting with life from that night on he maded his habit he jump off roofs ever higher while clutching an umbrella after a while he got pretty good at it too he saw that by kicking his legs and twisting his back a certain wagt he could actually prolong his flight coasting all over the place sometimes only landing after several daring minute tall it came to pass that the pengwin started hearing more and more about a certain anny named mary pfpins she too he was told had been floating around londond hanging from an umbrella handle everywhere he went the penguin kept hearing about her how it was simply insaying that they had not met each other yet finally a dinner party was arranged by someone who knew them both and on the evening of the party the pengwin walked into the drawing room saw mary pofpins on the divaun doff tis top hat and bowed low as was his style in those days he flanned a few things to say and do one first meeting mary popins he thought he might lift up his umbrella as though challenging or to a duel he imagined she would smile and take up er own frilly perhaps pink umbrella and then together they would dance about the room leaping over furniture parrying and thrusting perhaps even winding things op breathing heavily nose to nose o oo instead what happened was the penguin became very shy and quie it as he stood there staring at her his ta pat felt needlessly clumsy his monicle too small for his face and the squinting needed to keep it in place was giving him a slight headache for the first time in his life the pengin fell ludicrous i imagine you two must have an infinite amount of things to speak of said their host as he sat them together at the dinner table the pnguin nodded uncertainly after three or four minutes it became clear that the penguin and mary pofpins had absolutely nothing to say to one another that did not deale exclusively with umbrella travel getting stuck in trees the shoulder akes anxiety about tipping over in the wind everyone at the table just sat there staring at them expectantly which made the whole thing even more awkward trying to move things along mary popins asked the penguin if he to sing to which the penguin responded only whone i'm drunk then she asked if he enjoy children to which he replied yes in a sweet wine sauce the penguin then asked mary pofpins how she kept people from looking up her skirt when she flew she smiled politely then turned to the man on her laft and asked him how he was enjoying the lamb the man on her left was wearing an elegant aristocratic hake marry a bit drunk on the sherry noted that if he spread his cape out he might be able to glide about a bat the man on her left chuckle and suggested after dinner they had up to the roof and give it a try which they did doun of the gold stine he is the hoset of potcast heavy weight which feels exactly this

glass and if you are just turning in this week we are throwing out our regular way of doing things three or four stories in some theme bababa to hell with all that instead we are trying to cramp as many stories into one hour as we humanly can we guarantee twenty there may be more we are at number eleven eticatte lesson here is reater david sai aris an amen's room at the gardy airport i watched a man take a sellphone from his jacket pocket step into an empty stall and proceed to dial i thought he had come for the relative privacy but looking through the space beneath the door i saw that his pants were gathered about his ankles he was sitting on the toilet most airport calls begin with geography i'm in cansas city people say i'm in huston i'm at kennedy when asked where he was the man on the phone said simply i'm at the airport what do you think the sounds of a public toilet are not the sounds he would generally associate with an airport and he is what do you think struck me is unfair the personhe was talking to obviously felt the same way whet do you mean what airport the man said i it laguardy and now put me through to mardy a few hours later i was in boston relating the story to my sister tiffany i mean he actually placed a call while sitting on the tolet tiffany is big on rules and i expected a certain degree of outrage i want to discussed but instead she sait one la i do not believe in selphones but you do believe in talking on the phone while sitting on the toilet was not a belief she said but i mean sure when asked how she explains the noise tiffany scrunched up her face and held an imaginary receiver to her mouth i say do not mind me i'm just troying to get leit off this jar her face returned to normal and i thought of all the times i had fallen for that line all the times i had pictured my sister standing helpless in her kitchen try tapping the lid against the counter top i'd said or rincet in hot water that is sometimes works he ventually after much struggle she would let out of breath there we go she would say i've got it now and then she would say thank you and i'd hang up thinking well et's a good thing she called me david said aris his newr book colipso comes out this may a twelve to tell the truth this was requitted by brant ranon in the consection of the public library my hands punish me many times i i i live i was home one day and i

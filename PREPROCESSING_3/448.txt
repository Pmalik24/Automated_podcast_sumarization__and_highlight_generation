welcome to the huberman laon science science tace to ce fr i mander huberman and on a professor of nerbilogy and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor jack feldman doctor jack feldman is a distinguished professor of nerbilogy at the university of talifornia lost angelus he is known for his pioneering work on the nero science of breathing we are all familiar with breathing and how essential breathing is to life we require oxygen and it is only by breathing that we can bring oxygen to all the cells of our brain and body however as the work from doctor feldman and colleagues tells us breathing is also fundamental to organ health and function at enormous number of other levels in fact how we breathe including how often we breathe the depth of our breathing and the ratio of inhales to exhals actually predicts how focused we are how easily we get into sleep how easily we can ex it from sleep doctor feldman gets credit for the discovery of the two major brain centers that control the different patterns of breathing to day you will learn about those brain centers and the patterns of breathing they control and how those different patterns of breathing influence all aspects of your mental and physical life what is especially wonderful about doctor feldman and his work is that it not only points to the critical roll of respiration in disease in health and in daily life but he is also a practition er he understands how to leverage particular aspects of the breathing process in order to by as the brain to be in particular states that can benefit us all whether or not you are a person who already practise his breath work or whether not your somebody who simply breathes to stay alive byt the end of to day's discussion you are going to understand a tremendous amount about how the breathing system works and how you can leverage that breathing system toward particular goals in your life doctor feldman shares with us his own particular breathing protocalls that he uses and he suggests different avenues for exploring respiration in ways that can allow you for instance to be more focused for work to disengage from work in high stress endeavors to calm down quickly and indeed he explains not only how to do that but all the underlying science in ways that will allow you to customize your own protocals for your needs all the guests that we bring on the huberman lad podcast are considered at the very top of their fields today's guest doctor feldman is not only at the top of his field he founded the field prior to his coming into narow science from the field of physics there really was not much information about how the brain controls breathing there was a little bit of information but we can really credit doctor feldman and his laboratory for identifying the particular brain areas that control different patterns of breathing and how that information can be leverage towards health high performance and for combating disease to day's conversation you are going to learn a tremendous amount from the top researcher in this field hit is a really wonderful and special opportunity to be able to share his knowledge with you and i know that you are not only going to enjoy it but you are going to learn a tremendous amount before we begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching ind research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire an effort to bring zero costo consumer information about science and sience related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens af letic greens is an al in one vitemen mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand ind twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reasen i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutricional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which our vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called gop microbiom and the ways in which the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essentialy with every biological system relevan to health throughout your brain and body without letic greens i get the vitemens i need the minerals i need end the probiocs to support my microbiom if you' to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock com slash hubermen and claim a special offer the will give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemen d thre k too ther are ton of dat and now showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficien in vitemend three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstock com slash hubermen to claim the special offer of the fie free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratioes of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and petassium but it has no sugar ave talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration end electrolites for nerve self function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the proparatioes all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolites are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormon systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration end that your getting the proparatioes of electrolites if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is eleement dok com slash hubermen and you'l get a free element sampl pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try elemen you can go to element element dok com slash hubermen one quick mention before we dive into the conversation with doctro feldmen during to days episode we discuss a lot of breathwork practices and by the end of the episode all the s will be accessible to you however i am aware that there are number of people out there they want to go even further into the science and practical tools of breath work and for that reason i want to mension of resource to you there is a cost associate with this resource but it is a terrific platform for learning about breathwork practices and for building a number of different routines that you can do or that you could teach it is called our breathwork collective i'm not associated with the breathwork collective but doctor feldman is an adviser to the grew and they offer daily live guided breathing sections and an ondeman library you can practise any time freework shops on breath work and these are really developed by experts in the field including doctor feldman as i mention i'm not on their advisereboard but i do know them and their work and it is of the utmost quality any one wanting to learn or teach breathwork could really benefit from this course i believe if you to learn more you can click on the link in the show notes or visit our breath collective doc calm slash hubermen and use the coat huberman at checkout and if you do that they will offer you ten dollars off the first month again it is our brath collctive doct calm slash hubermen to access the our breath collective and now for my conversation with doctor jack feldman thanks for joining me today it is he pleasure beerg that is been a long time coming you are might go to source for all things respiration i mane i breathe on my own but when i woll not understand how i breathe and how the brain and breathing interact you are the person i call hi'll do my best as there is a lot that we do not understand which still keeps we employed in engage but tho we do no a lo when we start off by just talking about what is involved in generating breath and if you would could you comment on some of the mechanisms for rhythmic breathing verses nonrerhythmic breathing o k on the mechanical side which is obvious every one we i want av a flow in an hail and we need have a a flow out and the reason we need to do this is because for body ment taboliswhom we need oxygen and when oxyges utalize to the meta erobe metabolic process we produce condoxide and we have to get rid of the comndox id the we produce in particular because the comndoxide effects the s o base balance to the blood the p h and all living sells our very sensitive to what the pge value is your body is very interest ind a regulating that p we have to have nough oxygen for our nomometabolism and we have to get rid seal to ther re produce how d we generate the saflow well theyare comes into the luns we have to expand the luns and its the lungs expan facicaly is a balloon that you would pull apot the pressure inside that balloon drops and er will flow into the blo we expamp pull a pressure on put pressue on the lun to pull it apa tha lors the p ressure in the airsacks called al viali and air will flow in because pressure outside the body is hire than pressure inside the body when your doing the expansion when you inhal it what produces that while the principal muscle is a the diaphram which is sitting inside the body just below the long and when you wone a in hail you basely contract the diaphram and impulls it down nd is o pulls it down its inserting pressiure forcles on the long the long ons to expand at the same time the rib cage is going to ro tate up and out and therefore expanding the docavity the thorasi cavity at the end of inspiration an the normal conditions when youre atrest you just relax and is pulling on a spring you pulled on a spring and you let go in a relax of ion anhal and you exale anow relax in exile the exile is passive i at ressit passive will get into what happens when ou need to increased of the amount of an you bringing in because your ventilation yon me tablis and goes up doing exercise o now the muscles themselves kellna muscles do not do anything unless then nervous system tells them to do something and when the nervous system tells them to do something they contract there as special eyes nurons in the sona chord and above the sponachor the region called the brainsthem which go to respitory muscles in particular for inspiration the daphram and the external inthe costle muscles in the rib cage and they contract o these respiatory muscles these inspitory muscles become active in h comactive for a period of time than they become silent and when they become silent the muscles tend relax back to their original resting level where does that activity in the these nurons that innovate the muscle which are called modiner ans wiris that originate well this was ta question thats been banding around for thousands of years and when i was a beginning a system professor it was fairly high priority for me to trying figure that out because i wantit on the stand where this wrhythem a breathing was coming from and you could not nowhere ixcoming from into you knew where was coming from and i i enphrase that probably you could't understand howit was being done until weare ta look we did a lot of experiments which i can go into detail and finally fown there was a region in the brains them thats once again this region sort of above the sparna cord which was critical for generating this rithem is called the prebut singer complex and we could talk about how i was name this small sight which contains inhumans a few thousand nurans it is located on either side and works antan them an every breath begins with nurans in this region beginning to the active and knows nrans then connect ultimately to these modinurans going to the diaphram and to the external inthe costles causing im to be acted in causing this inspetory effort when the nurans in the prebuter complex finish their burst of activity then inspiration stops and then you begin to exale because of this passive o recoil of the long and ribcage could i a just briefly interrupt you o ask a few quick questions coer of we move a forward in this a very informative i answer and the the two questions are om is there anything known about the activation of the diafram in the intercosta musles between the ribs as it relates to nose verses mouth breathing or are they activated o in the equivalent way regardless of we the not some one as breathing through their nose or mouth i i do not think we fully have the answer to that clearly there are differences between nasal and mouth breathing a at reat that tendency is to do nasal breathing because the air flows that an necessary for normal breathing as easily a manage by passing through the nasal cavities however when your ventilation neecs the increase doing exercise you need to move more air you do that through your mouth becase the airways o much larger than and therefore you can move much more air but it the level of the intercostles and the diaphram ther contraction i is not is almost a agnostic to rather not the nose and mouth are open oca ther i vinishin correctly am there is no reason to suspect that there are particular perhaps even non overlapping sets of nurans in prebut singer very of the brain stem that trigger nasal vers's mouth in hals no i would say that ther is itit is not that the prebutsin complex is not concernd and can not influence that but it does not appear as if there is any a modulation of whether or not as where the air is coming from with us coming through unasal passages of through your mouth thank you and then the other question i have as that these intercosta muscles between the ribs that move the the ribs up and out if i naschan cregly and the diafram a are those skeletol or as the brits would say skiletale a muscle or smooth muscles what type of muscle aa re talking about here as as i saider earlier these a scelledem insayto ascelda muscles but their muscles that need norlyn put in order to move you talked about smooth muscles w theyr specialized muscles we have in the got and in the hat and these ar muscles that a capable of actually contracting and relaxing on their own the hart beats it does not need norlyn put in order to beat it the norlyn put smodulate the strength of it in the frequency but they beat on their own the skell the muscles involved in breathing are neednorlymput now the're are smooth muscles that have an influence on breathing and thesea muscles that alining the the ailways and the ailways have smooth muscle and when they become activated the smooth muscle can contract or relax and when they contract in appropriately is when you have problems breathing an aspa as mas a condition wer get inappropriate constriction of the smooth muscles of the airways there is no reason to think that in ashma that the prebot singer or these other neronal senters in the brain that codthat activeat breathing that they are involved or causale for for things asthma as of now i would say the preponderance of evidence that it is not invav but we have not really fully investigated that thank you sorry to break your flo o butid was terribly interested in and knowing answers those questions any provided them thank you anow remind me again where i was in my w were just landing and prebot singer and we will return to the naming of prebot singer bcause it is a wonderfull an important story really ot i think people should i beware of but yat many could march us through the brain centers that you have discovered a and others have worked on as well if that control breathing prbt singer as well as ble caacters we when we discoverd the prebutsinger we thought that it was the primary sace of all rhythmic respeatory movements both inspiration and expiration a the od notion of a single source is they are niht it is they are ll coming they are lof the same argin at the earth rotates and day follows night and we thought that the prebusing of complex wuld the inhalation exlation a and then in the series of experiments we a did in the early part of two thousand we discovered that the seemed to be another region which was dominent an producing expetory movements that is the exelation we had made a fundamental mistake through since with the discovery the prebusinger not taking into account that at rest expetory muscill activit your excellation is passive if that is the case a group of nurans that might generate act of expiration that is to contract the expetory muscles the abdomina muscles of the internal into costles are just silent we just thought it was not there was coming from one place but we got evidence that in fact it may been coming from another place and following up on this experiments we disscovered that there was di second oscillator and that oscillator is involved in generating what we call active expiration that is this actively vish the or wen begin to exercise after and action move that ere out this group of selves which is silent the dress suddenly becomes active to drive those muscles and it appears that it is independent osillator when a maybe ge just clarefivor be what an oscillator is lookanan oscillator is something that goes in a sycle you can have a pendulum is an ocillator going back and forth the earth is an oscillated because it goes around and sday and night some people's moods ar oscillating oscillate and it depends how regular they are you can have oscillateds the highly regular that ar in a watch or you can have those that are speratic or episotic breathing is when of those oscillators that for life has to be working continuously twenty four seven its thoughts in laid in the thir timaster because it has to be working when your born and basically works throughout life and if it stops if there is no intervention beyond the few minutes it wul likely be fatal what is this a second oscillator called well we found that on in a wegion around the facial nuclius we initially but when this region was initially identified it we thought it was involved in sensing covendoxideor as what we call cential cumo receptor that is we want to keep condoxide levels particularly in the brain at a relatively stable level cause the brain is extraordinarily sensitive the changes in p h if there is a big shift in scomdoxide to be ash big shift in brain p h and tatithor your brain if i can use the technacal term out of wack and you want to regulate that the way to regulate something in the brain is you have a censor in the brain and a others basely identified that the ventual surface of the brains them that is tepar the brains tha that is on this side a was critical for that and then we a dentified of structure that we a was near the trapizoy nucleus it was not named in any of these noranatomical atlesis we just pick the name at the hat and we called it the retre trapisoy nucleus ashy clarfivorbele when we when a jackesan trapazoy does not ean the rapazoid muscles trapazi refers to the shape a of this nuclystis cluster of nurans a parafatial makes me think that this general areais involved in something related to mouth or face a is it an area rich with a nuran's controlling other parts of the face i blanks nose twhich is o lip curls lips maxs if you go back in evolutionary sense and a lot of things that are hat to figure out begin to make sense when you look at the evolution of the nervous system when a control of facial muscles going back to more primitive creatures because they had to take things in their mouth for eating they recall that the in the face sort of developed the eyes where they are te mouthis there these nuclii the motin that contained the mote nurans a lot of the control systems for them developed in the immediate vicinity if you thing about the face there is a lot of subnucl around there that had verious souls at various different times in evolution and at one point in evolution the facial muscles were probably very important in moving fluid in and out of the mouth and ma moving air in n aut of the mouth and part of that of these many different ob nuclii now seems to be in mamels to be involved in the control of expetory muscles but we have to remember that mamels of very special when it comes to breathing because wite the only class of vertebrates that have a diaphrame if you look an infibians and reptiles they do not have a daphrame and the way they breathe is not by actively inspiring and passively expiring they breathe by actively expiring and passively inspiring because they do not have ey powerful inspetwe muscle and somewhere along the line the diaphrame developed and there lots of theories about how it developed on nothing its particularly clear there was they a a something you confined and allegators and lizards that could have turned into a muscle thet was o diet to diaphram the mazing thing about the diaphram is that it is mechanically extremely efficient and what do i mean by that both yuif you look at how oxygen gets from outside the body into the blood stream the critical passage is across the membram in the lung cold the alvla caplary membrane the alvilis is part of the lung and the blood runs through capilaries which these the smallest tubes in the circulatory system and it is at poing oxygen can go from the apil alvilas into the a blood which is amazing i find that amazing even though it is just purely mechanical ye ad y to it these little sacks on our lungs we inhale on the air goes in and leterly the oxygen can pass into the blood stream astis into the blutchring but there the rade of which it passes will depend on the characteristics of the membrane how what the distance is between the alvils and of the blood vessel capulary but it the key element is the surface area the big of the surface aria the more oxygen that can pass through it is entirely a passive process there is no magic about making oxygen co in now how do you get a pack a lorge surface ara in a smal chest wel u start out with one tube which is the trace the trace expands now you have two tubes then you have for tubes and it keeps branching at some point at the end of those branches you put a little bit a little sphere which is now velis and that determines what the surface aria is going to brig be now you then have a mechanical problem yu have the surface aria you have to be able to pullit of port imagine you have a little square of alastic lembrane it does not take a lot of force to poet apart but now if you nincrease it by fifty times you need a lot more force to poet apart infibians who were breathing not by compressing the lungs and then jus passively expanding it were not able to generate a lot of force they have relatively few branches if you look at the surface ary that they pack in their lungs roative to their body size it is not very impressive wers when you get to mamals the amount of branching that you have is you have fort or five hundred million alvila how if we were to take this fort of five million of a fie lilion foe hundred fot of hundred hundred millions cuse me on and lay those out flat what sort of surface arry are we talking ababout seventy square meters which is about a third the size of a tennis court you hve a membraane inside of your third desize in a tennis court that you actually have to expand every breath and you do that without exerting much of a youn feelic and that is because you have this amazing muscle f the diafram which because of its positioning just by moving two thirds of an inch down is able to expand that membrang enough to move air into the logs now the the at reast the volue of air in your lines is about two and a half leaders do we need to convert that to quartz no that i's about to and a half leaders when you take a breath you taken enother five hundred milleders a halfa leader that is the size may be a litt of my fist your increasing the volume by twenty per cent but your you doing that by pulling on this seventy squam met a membrane but that is enough to bring enough fresh air into the long to mix in with the air that is already there that the oxion levels in your your blood stream goes from e partial pressi of oxygen which is forty milimitos of mercury to a hundred milimuson mercury that is a huge increase in oen and that is enough to sustain no mometabolism we we have this amazing a mechanical advantage by having a diaphrym do you think it that our brains are larger than that of other mammels in part because of the amount of oxygen that we have been able to bring into our system i would say a key stap in the ability to develop a large brain that has a continuous te men for oxygen is the diaphram without a diaphram you are an imfibi and there and and th there is another solution to increasing ocion up take which is the way birds breathe but birds have other limitations and the still cannot get brains as big as ar mamals hav we we the the brain utilizes may be twenty per cent of all the oxygen that we ntake and it meeds it continuously you cannot the brain does not when to be neglected this put certain demands on breathing system and other words you cannot shut it down for a while which poses other issues you are born and you have to mature you have the small body you have a small lon you have a very plint rib cage and now you have to developmento an adult which has a stiffer rib cage and ther changes happening in your brain in your body we are breathing the noral control of breathing has to change on the fly it is not for things vision a where you have the oppertune to sleep and while your sleeping the brain is caple of doing things that ar not easy doing doing wratefulness the construction crue comes en during sleep a breathing has been the change of breathing i describe as trying the build an airplane why its fall is flying busy wic jacki saying is dead on respiration science is more complex and hard working than vision science which is a direct jabit me u that some of you might have missed but i definitely donot miss and i appreciate that you always o a thake the opportunity a good new yorker to to yo ot giv me a good healthy a intellectual jab a question related to diaphromatic breathing verses non diaphromatic breathing because the way you describe it the diefram is always involved but over the years whether it be for you yoga glass or a breath work saying or you here on line that we should be breathing with our diaphrame that rather than lift ing our ribcage when we breathe an our jest that it is healthier in our quotes or better somehow to have the belly expand when we inhale i'm not aware of any particular studies that really examined the direct health benefits of diaphromatic verses non diaphromatic breathing but if you do not mind commenting on anything you are aware of a as it relates to diaphromatic verses non diaphromatic breathing whether not people tend to be diaphromatic breathers by default et cetera that would be i think interesting to a number of people by thing by teefault we are obligante diaphrme breathers i am there may be pythologies where the diaphram is compromise and you have the us are the muscles and that is a challenge im it certainly at rest other muscles can take over but if you need to increase of entilation the diaphrame is very importants put behart t increase orventillation otherwise do you pay attention to whether not you are breathing in a manner where your belly a it goes out a little bit as you inhale because i can do it both ways right i can inhale bring my belly in or i can inhale push my di diefrm and belly out not the diefram out but in that is interesting right because it is a completely different muscles sat for each a each version wa i in in the contects of things breath practice i'm a a bit i a agnostic about the effects of some of the different patens are breathing clearly some ogonect works of different mechanismsm we can talk about that but at soden level for example whether it is primarily diaphrame where you move your abnement or not i am agnostic about it i think that the changes that that breathing in duses in emotion an cognition i have different ideas about what the influences and i do not see that primarily as how which particular muscles your choosin but thut just co be my own preciouse oca im were we will return to that as a general theme an will bit i i ant to ask you about sighing i one of the gma any great gifts that you have givin us over the years a is an understanding of these things that we call physiological size am can you tell us about physiological size o what is known about them what youre particular interest in them is and a what they are good for ithy a very interesting an important question soveryone has a a sense of what a sigh its we certainly when we'r emotional emotional and some ways wit stras wer particularly happy will take a will sigh it turns out that werl sighing all the time and ut when i would ask people and not particularly knowledgble that haven read my papers sor james thes this book or listen to your pod cast a there usually off by to whart is a magnet to about how frequently we side on the low side notherwors they s at once an hour o ten times a day we sigh about every five minutes and i would i encourage anyone who finds that to be the unbelievable fact s to lie down in a quiet room and just breathe normally just relax just let go and just pay attention to your breathing and you find that every couple of minutes youre takin a deep breath and you cannot stop it it it just it just happens now why bt we have to go back to the long again the long has these five hundred million of your line and the very tiny ther two hundred micrines across for the really really thing and you can think of them is fluid fill their fluid line and the reason of fluid line has to do it the a esaterica of the mechanics of that it makes it a leasier to stretch them with this fluid line which is called facten as a fact that is important during development at is a determining factor in the when premature infants o born if they di not do not have lungs of fact and that makes a much more challenging to take care them than after t o have lungs of fact an which is some time for remember correctly in the late second early fir trimester wicsh ould appears in any cases fluid line now think of a balloom that you would blow up but now before you blow it oup fill the baloom o water squeeze a had warder out and now o when you please oll the water out you notice the size an a balloon stick to each other why is that butl that is because warter has whits calld surface tension and when you have two surfaces of warter together they actually tend to stick to each other now when you try and blow that be loon op that it or you will notice if you heven done it before that the balloon is a little hard at to in flate then if we are dry on the inside why is that because you have to overcome that surface tension well you'l veali have a tendency to collapse there is five hundred million in them they' not collapsing at a very high rate but it is a slow rate it is not trivialand when it alveles collapses it no longer can receive ox a gin or take comdoc side out it is hat ae taken out f the ucration now to have five hundred million in em in ou lose ten no big deal but if they keep collapsing you can lose a significant part of the surfacer of you long now enormal breath i's not enough to pop them open but if you take a deep breath it hous am ovo through noassoanouth a gas'a or it is just increase that long volume cause you are just pulling on the longs they' pop open ive bot every five minutes i and with doing it every five minutes in order to maintain the health of our lon in the early days of mechanical ventilation which was used to treat polio victims who had the weakness of their respiatory muscles they be put in these big sfeeld toobs and the way they would work is that the pressure outside the body would drop that would put a expansion pressure on the the longs ixig on the ripcages the ripatroan expand and then the long would expan and then the pressurewould go back to nomo and the long an ripation go back to noma there was a this was great for getting ventilation but there was a relatively hind mortality rate with a bit of a mystery and one solution was to just give biger breath they get biger breath in a metality rate drop and it was not til i think it was the fifties with they realize that they did not have to increase every breath to be big but they needed to dois every often to have one big breath yougave a couple of minutes a nomal braths and then one big breath just mimicing the physiological size and than the withality rate drop significantly and if you see some one on event eventilator in the hospital if you watch every couple of minutes tat you see the membering move up and down every couple o minutes to be a superbreath and that pops it open there these mechanisms for these physiological size just wut the collapse ot the lungs where you need a big a pressure to pop it open it is the same thing with the alvila youneed a biger pr essia and e norbal breath is not enough se have to take a big inhil and when nature is done is instead of requiring us to remember to do it it does it automatically and it does it about every five minutes and one of the questions we want it we asked is how is this happening why every five minutes what is what is doing it and we got into it to a back door at typical of the way lot of science gats tonis is serrin dipitus o a a then when you run across o paper and something clects and you just we you follow it up sometimes to go down blind ends but this tuned out to be incredib e productive one of the guise on y lay up was readng the paper about stress and during stress lots of things happened in the body one of which is that type osalenis which is very reactive te body state releaseis peptites which are specialized molecules which then circulate throughout the brain and body that particular efects usually to help to better with thestress and one class of the peptize the release o cobomisin related pemptets and he also realized because he was a breathing guoy can we distress you si more we said a right may be there related bombisin is relatively cheap to body we said let us by som bombisin throw it and the brins then let us see what happens and youn the when the nice things about asome experiments that we try to design is to fail quickly here we had the idea we throw bombison in and if bombson did nothing not nothing loss may be fifty dollas to by the bombison but if it did something it might be of some interest we ene afternoon he ded the experiment and he comes to me says i want quote exactly what he said because the a mighto need to be censer but he said look at this and it was in a rat rats side bat every two minutes tif smaller than we are in the neath to sign were often this sirate from when from twenty to thirty per hour to five hundred per hour when he put bombson into the prebuzin complexisit and the way did that is he took a very very fine blass needle and a nest a ties a rat and inserted that needle directly into the prebutzior complex it wasnit generalized the livery the peptide was localized to the prebutzigar the sirat went through the roof and i would a aded that wasnat important experiment to deliver the bombisin directly to that site because one could have concluded that the injection of the bomisan increased sign because it increased stress rather than directly increase siging amongst hundreds of other possible interpretation the precision here is very important and that goes back to what i said at the very beginning knowing where this as happening allows he to do the proper investigations if we dint know were the inspitory withem is originating wek never could have done this experiment and then wthen we did another experiment we said o ka what happens if we take the cells in the prebutzinger that a responding to the peptide norns will respond to a peptide because they have specialized receptors for that peptide and not every norin expresses those receptors in the prebesive complex probably a few hundred out of thousands we use the technique we had used before and this is the techni the developed by dug lapping down in santiaco were you could take a peptide in conjugated with a molec called sapron sapran is a plan therive molecule which is a cousin to riceand and many of your listners may have heard of rice and pesisomal tox it it is very nasty it is it a single gou know stab with an umbrella will kill you which is say oh something that supposely happene to a bulgarian diplomat by a russian operative on a bridge in london he got stabbed and the way rice and work is it goes inside a cell crosses the cell membrangos inside the cell kills the cell and goes to the next cell and then the next cell and then the next cell it is on it is extremely a dangerous that it is firstly impossible to work on in a laap in the united states they will not letreush o rice because we have workd with saperin many times sapron is safe because it does not cros sell membranes you gan injection o sapron and will not do anything cause its tace outside the cells please nobody do that even though it does not cossell memories please nobody inject saparon whether not you are a operative or otherwise thank your injur for protecting me there of but what duglapy to get out is that when a ligan bis for receptor there is when a moleco binds o its receptor in many cases that receptor ligan complex get's pulled inside the cell goes from the membr in the cell inside the cell tu you cannot go to the dance alone but it is you are coupled up you get in the door it that is right he fo get at us e but sapron to the peptide the peptide binds to uts receptor it gets internal ize and then when it is inside th e sell sapron does the same thing ha riceened us it kills the cell but then it cannot go into the nexcell the only cells that get killed or the more polite tarm oblated r sells that express that receptor if you have a big conglameration of sells the have a few thous and and only fifty of them wes express that receptor then you injec the sapron conjugated to the ligid to the pepti and only those fifty sells tigh we took bombisin conjugated to saprin injectin the prebusin complex of rats and it took about a couple of days for the saprin to actually a blit cells and what happened this that the mi thought it sighing less and less an excis me the rats sthouht is sighing less and less andless andless an essentially stop sig am your student or postock was it murdered these cells and as a consequence the sigin goes away what was the consequence of e liminating sin on the internal state or the behavior of the rats wedi in other words if one cannot sigh the generate physiological size what is the consequence on state of mind adu you would imagine that carmendoxide would build up more readily or om te higher levels in the blood stream and that the animals would be more stress that that is the cot of logical extension of the way we set it up it was less benin than that when the animals got to the point whre they were in sighing then and we did not a the terminus but the presumption was that the long functions significantly deteriated and there physiala their whole health the curate is significantly and we had to sacrifice them i cannot tell you whether they was stress or not but their breathing got to be significantly a o the curirated that we sacrifice them with that point now we do not know whether that is pe sifically related to the fact that then sigh or that it is the was secondary damage due to the fact that some selstie we never determined that now after we did this study to be candid it wasnat high preority for us to get the selthadorn publishment it stayed on the shelf ten i got a fon call from a gradus through this thanfort cevinacl who stouhts asking me all these interesting questions about breathing and am happy to answer them but at some point concern me because he was working for rena own by o chemis who worked on long in trosophela fruitflies a mor crasnan no as nex tor collegue ri now and i said why you ask i me tis andy si was non to graduat you see alay and you gave a lecture and on my undergraduar class and i was curious about breathing ever since that is hone those things which as a professor you bluff to here that actually as something really effectid the life of us the when you burst the competitor but you had only yourself to blame no i i do not look at that as a competitor i i think that this enough intheresing things to go on i know some of u norous sins colleagues say you can work on my layab but then when you leave my lab you gar t work on something different no one i ever trained was said that it is it is open field you oneto work on something if you hive in the max and im but the there are people that nor scientis that i never felt i hear that their breathing apparati are disrupted and thet causes of braind tis function that leads to the behaviour yuse just described itsection not true m a but o but in terms of the i the before you we talk about the the beautiful story with with yackle and craws now and felt lab i want to just make sure that i understand if physiological size do not happen basically breathing over all suffers well tha dat would go back to the observations and polo victims in these hin lungs weare the principal teaf as it was there was noho hyperinflation of the longs and they many them teteorated and die am and just to stay on this one more moment before a a we move to what you were about to describe we here often that people will overdose on drugs of various kinds because they stop breathing sa barbitua its alcohall combine with barbituots as a common cause of death a for drugg users and contrarindications of drugs in thse kinds of things you hear all the time about celebritiese dying because they combined alcolhall with barbituots is there any evidence that the size that occur during sleep or during states of you knor deep deep a relaxation om at and sedation that size recover the the brain because o you cand imagine that if these size do not happen as a consequence of some drug impactin these brain centers that that could be one cause of basically asphyxiation and death if you look at the progression of i namo to death you find that their breathing slows ter a death through to crotnatural course theyre breathing slows down it is well stop and then they will gasp we have the phrase dying gasp wsuperlogi res a there oten discribes an attempt to orte resussitate that is to take that superde breath and that may be it conkix thought the engine again we do not know thet thegree tos such things as gap are really size that are particularly lodge and if you suppress the ability to gasp in an individual who is e subject to an overthose then wheres they might been able to rearouse their breathing if that is prevented they do not get rearoused that is certainly a possibility a but this has not been investigated an e wone of things that om interested in is in individuals who have a diseases which will effect prebuzing af complex and there is there is data in paukinsens disease and multible systematrophy which is another form of nor degeneration were tis loss of nurons in prebutzinger and the qression is and it also may happen in aless sometimes yer fir to his logarixacies a my chofho clados carossus these individuals often die during sleep we have an idea that we have not been able to get anyone to test is that patience woit pawkinson's patience with im teless timidally breathe normally duing wakefulness the disturbances that they have not breathing as doing sleep pogasif pationts at the instages of the disease often have significant disturbances in their sleep hattern but not doing wakefulness and we think that what could be happening as that the proximate cause of dath is not haut failure is that they become appneac they stopp breathing and do not resussitateand that resuscitation may may not be du to an explicit suppression of size but to an overall suppression of the whole apparatus of the prebutzing af complex god thank you e yacl calls you oup he cauls us cause me up and is great hards superslot and he tells me about these these expermencitys doing we are keyse looking in a data base to try and find out what molecules are en richd in regions of the brain that are critical for breathing we and others avd mapped out these regions in the brains stam and he was looking one of these data basis to see what is en r etched and i said that is great we be willing to suc a share or work together sosnow i my advisor does won me to do that said o kat but ceavens a great kid and i in te joy talking to him and he is a smart i and what i found a in academia and is that the smartest people only one a high of people smarter than them the only one and have the profince inter act with people smarter than them the a a the faculty who were not at the highest level and that every institution ther say distribution ther oince above the mean an those below the me nows whom below the mean a very threatened by that and a i saw keaven as ii shining light and i did not care whethe was going out compete me because whatever he did was going to help me in the field i wuld i did wherever i cannot help to work with keaven one point i got invited to give granrounds an neurology at stanford turns out and unergraduate student who ad work with me was now ahead of the training program for nerolegist tid stanford and he invited me and at the end of my visit i go to mal crawsnel's office and ceaven is the are and a postac pungly who was also working on a project was there and twas the end of conversation a the amark sas to me we found this one molecule which is highly concentrated in who important region for breathing i wit that is great what is it and he says i cannot tell you because we want a work on it a'm course i'm disappointed but i realize that uis in they the ethic in some ariens of science of the custom in some years of science is that until you get a publication you be relatively strictin in sharing far arin a a chat when i came back nowin well he may remember the story differently but a i said okt and as am walking out the door i remember these experiments i described you about bombison and i was the only unusual molec you were working the reason i'm rushing out the doors have a flight to cat i stick my head in i said is this molecho related to bombason and then i run off in only waite for them to reply i b up for it ma calls me an he says bombison the pepto we found is related to bombison what is it do and i said i'm not telling that o my and glat i was i d involved in the satabery not not but but that was sort of a a tease cause i said well let us work together and then we worke together it the isners dilemma at that point you yel im ceaveny acle is spectacular i has zon labit you see us av and the work that i'm familiar with i from ceaven is is worse mentioning now im or i i'll ask youed it to mention it which is this recipical relationship between brain state where we coand even say emotional state and breathing and i'd love to get your thoughts on how breathing interacts with other things in the brain ah you have beautifully described how breathing controls the longs the diaphram in the interactions between oxygen and carmodaxide and forth but as we know when we get stressed our breathing changes when we are happy and relaxed our breathing changes but also if we change our breathing we in some sense can adjust our internal state what is the relationship between brain state and breathing and if you would because i know you have a particular im love of of one particular aspect of this what is the relationship between brain rhythms oscillations if you will and breathing this is a topic which is really entrigued me over the pastecate i would say before that i was in my syloge just interested about how the rhythm or breathing is generated and then rearly pay much attention to this other stuff for some reason i got interested in it and i thing was trigged by an article and the new york times about mindfulness now beleathe or not although id lived in california for twentieth of a time i never heard a mindfulness it is staggering how isolated you could be from the real world and i gugled it and thre was a mindfulness instituo you seea it and they were giving courses on meditation sa this is greay because i can now see whether r not the breathing part of meditation as anything to do with the preported effects of meditation i signed up for the course and as i joke to you before i had two golls pone was to see whether or not a breathing haan effect and the other was to levitate because i grew up when all these cone frue things and all the monks could lev ittate when they meditated why not am we have a mile in the layup you cannot do anything interesting if your fraid of failing and if i failed to levirtate while least i try and i should tell you no i still have not done it yet but i have not given up yet i have not given up am i i took this course in mindfulness and it became apparent to me that the breathing part was actually critical it was not simply a distraction or focuss it you now they could hagur move your index finger to the same effect i really bebelieve that the breathing pot was involved now i'm not an unbiase observer i crestionist how can i demonstrate that i dou feel competent the do experiments and pumans and an feel lik could design ther experiment in humants but i felt ma o can study this an rodens we got this idea thatg we waing to teach rodens to meditate and it that is laughable but we said but if but if we can then we can actually study how this happened believe it a not i was able to get a a sort of stotogrant that not twenty one from ance ye see i age that is the national complimentary amedicineis a wonderful instatuti tiol mention our government puts major tax dollars toward studies of things meditation breathwork supplements herbs accupuncture a this is i think not well known and it is an incredible thing that this that our government does that and i think it deserves a nod and more funding i i thotally agree withoug i think that it is the kind of thing that many of us including many nermany scientist things is to woo and and unsubstantiated but we learning more and more we used to laugh a neurimianology that the nervous system that have anything to do with thim mune system and a pain itself can influence yur mune system i mean there were all these things that we are learning that we used to dismiss and i think there is this real nockets to be learned here they when not alymen tey fund ed this particular project and none but a leap ahead because for three years we throu stuff up against the wall that did not work and recently we had a major break through we found the proticol by which we can get mice to breathe slowly awaike mice to breath slowly i will not tell you normally they do not breath slowly no no now i's whatever a normal breath is we could slow it down by a factor of ten and theyr fine doing that we could do that for we did that thirty minutes a day for for weeks book ey a breath practice do they levitate we have not measure that yet i would say a priry we have not seen them floating to the top of thait cage but we have not wait them may be the way less they may be ou know livitation in isinva is grated and may be a fou way less it sor of a cautial ofation any case a we then tested and we had control animals mice we thid everything the same except manipulation we made did not slow down their breathing but they went throug everything else we then put them tho a stand that fair condition which we did with mi college michael fancilo whose one of the real gurers of fear and we measure the stand the test is the put mice in a condition were the concern af receive a shock and the responses that they freeze and a measure of how fearful they are as how long they freeze this is well validated and it is right above my paygreat a describe the volity of the test but it is free valo te mthe control mice had a freezing time which was just the same as ordinary mice would have the ones that went through a proticl frose much much less according to michael the the gree to which they we showed less freezing was as much as if there was a majour manipulation in the migla which is a part of the brain that is important in fear processing sa staggering change how when we have now is the grand ran animoney the post thot working an left and now we have to train piece together everything and a but the date is spectacular wha think it is it am i just pausy for a moment there because i think that the younan tilk about a road int study but i think the the benefits of doing roden studies the can get deep into mechanism a and for people that a might think well we have known that meditation has these benefits wide you need to get mechanistic science i think that a one thing that is important for people to remember is that first of all as many people as one might think ar meditating out there ar doing breath work afar far far greater number of people are not right i mean there is at the majority of people do not take any time to do dedicated breath work nor meditate am whatever can incentivize people would be a wonderful but the other thing is that it is never really been clear to me just how much meditation is required for a real effact meaning at a practical effact people say thirty minutes a day twenty mnutes a day once a week twice a week semething with breathwork am finding minimum er effective thresholds for changing noral circuitry is what i think is the holy grail of all these a practices and that is only con t be determined by the sorts of mechanistic studies that you describe s i this is wonderful i i do hope the work gets completed and m we cn talk about ways that a a we cen insure that that happens but am but let me let me at one think wich a saying intrue whene one of the isios i think for lot of people is that this iplicible effect that is inhumans they can respond to something even though the mechanism has nothing to do with what the the intervention is and it is easy to say that the meditative response is uppas as a bic component which is supasible effect my mice do not believe in the pocible effect and if we could show this the botified effect in mice it is convincing in ways that no matter how many human experiments you did the control for the placibl effect is extremely difficult in humans it mice it is its anomnation i think that that in of itself would be a enormous messass excellent and indeed a a better point a i think a thirty minute a day meditation a in these mice if inerchancorrectly the meditation we do not n whether think ing about at pract the legs of its breath practice that because we do not there presume we dare not thinking about their thirdi center lodisposition levitation whatever it is they are not instructed as to what to do in if they were they probably indo it anyway thirty minutes a day in which breathing is deliberately slowed or is slowed relative to their normal patterns of breathing got it a what was the frequency of sighing during that a thirty mansing o niclly do not kno well now we have the dat are we just analyzing that they to be determined our to be announced at some point a the feer centers are altered in some way that creates a a shorter fear response to a footshock a what are some other examples that you are aware of from workin your laboratory or work in other laboratories for that matter about interactions between breathing and brain state or emotional state this conspect or prier conversation i soten went off in a pension a wwe need i think we need to think separately of the effect of volitional changes of breathing on emotion firss the effect a the the effect of brain state on breathing the effect of brans that on breathing when you stress is i effect iti somely originating in higher centers if i can use that term effecting breathing it is the recepacal is that when you change breathing it effects your emotional state i think i think of those two things as different them the ultimably be tied together there is a landlock paper publish in the fifthies where they stimulated in the a migdla of cats and the petuwere they stimulated they got profound changes in breathing this every pattern of brething could possibly imagine they found he sight neamigila which could produce that this clearly a powerful descending effect coming from thelethe migle which is a major sight for processing emotion fear stresser what not that can affect breathing and clearly we have volitional control over breathing we have profound effects there now i should say about emotional control of breathing i need to segway in to talk about locked in cintrom locked in cindrome is a devastating mesion that happens in a part of the brains them with signals that controlled muscles ar transmitted the fibros coming from your moter quartax go down to this part of the the brain stem which is called eventual ponds and if there is a stroke there it condamaged these pathways what happens an individuals o have locked in cintrom is they lose all volitional movement except lateral movement of the eyes and maybe the ability to blink the reason they are able to still blink and move their eyes is that those control centers ar are rostril closer to are not interrupted tother words the interruption is below that they continue to breathe because the sent us for breathing do not require that volitional command and any case ther below that there ter fin these people continue to breathe normal intelligence but they cannot move thees a great book called the diving bell in the butterfly about a young man ar who had this happens to and h describes his life and it is a real testament to human the human condition that he does us it is a remarkable book is the short book te can' ie the book by blinking de areise latter e hedid by blinking to his caretaker it is pretty amazi an nos of moving which iv never seen with hovia bardin as the patagonist but the book i highly recommend is a any one to read a psycholegue studying inindividual had locked in cintr and the this patient breathes very robotically torally consistent very regular they gave the patient the lowoxion mixture to breathe ventilation went up a seel to mixture to breathe infleshwen up all the regulatory apparatus for breathing was there they has the patien to hold his breath or the breet fast ter nothing happen just the patien recognize the command but cun' changeit and all is on the patients breathing change considerably and they said their patient what happened he said you told the joke and i laughed and they went back whenever they told he joke that the patient found funny the patients breathing paten change and your breathing pattern when you laugh is you are anhowing to ha ha ha ha but it is also very distinctive we have some neurest science colleagues who will go on name who if you heard them laugh fifty yards away exactly who they are noa i' i'll mamem a eric can dell fo on has an inspiratory laugh it is famous for i suppose to exactly a exactly then it is very stheriatite but it it is maintained in these people lose volitional control of breathing there is an emotive component controlling your breathing which has nothing to do with your mission of the o velitial control and it goes down to a different pathway cause it is not destrupted by the sloctin sintrem if you look at moti control of the face we have the volitial control of the face but we also have moti contra emotioal control of the face which most of us cannot control when we look in another person we ten were able to read a lot about what they are their motional state is and that is a lot abot how primates communicate youmans communicate and you have people wofre a good deceivers probaly use cos halesmen a pocoplayers when now pocoplays no have tells but many of them now were doc lasis because the liva tells you blink o what not peopiles ize your bo size people ple size us to tell am which is an ortonomic function not as a a a skella muscle function but we have these only skelo muscles which were controlling which give us away i have t e i've tried to get my imaging friends to image some of the great actors that we have in losantial i seem brain imagers brainimage ye em no at's o i mean iyou brainimages because i think when when i tell aske you to smile i could tell that you are not happy that your smileing because i ask you to smile i get your ta's a traca joke but we we are old friend now i no a that that when when you see a picture i'd it a birthday want non sant sat cheese you could tell that at least half of the people are not happy the saing chese whereis a great actor when when they are able to dissemble in the fact that their sandor the happy you believe it did not faking it it is that is great acting and i do not think everyone could do that i think that the individuals are able to do that have some connection to the ports of their motive control system that the rest of us do not have maybe they develop it through training and may be not but i think at this can be image i would to get one of these great actors in a imageur and have them go to that and t think it a nomal person and see whether or not they can emulate that i think you can find picdifferences in the way they control the motive things this a motive control of th the facial muscles i think it is a large pot similar to te otiv control of breathing this that a motive control and there is the folicional control in their different tet thet different now the you ask me about the yackle stoff the yackle paper had to do with a sending that the effectie breathing on a motion what ceaven found was that there was a population of norans in the prebutzinga complex that we are always looking to things that are projecting ultomoe modinorams he found the population of cells that projected to locus serilius locussurius isas me as one of those places in the brain that seem to go everywhere togain sprinkler system exactly exact and influence move and you have had pocas about this i mean it theres a lot of stuff going on with the imais ucxcending the locusrilius you get into the locus srilius you can now spray information out throughout the entirebrate he found specific cells that projected from prebutzinger to locusrilius and that these cells are inspatory modulate now it is been known for a long time since the sixthies that if you look in the locus serilius of cats when thy're wake you find many nurns that have respetory modulation noine pay much attention to him why why bother not why byther paying attention but why would the braing bothe to have these implets wit keaven did with a lincey schwatz ante letion loslia is they killed oblayit those cells going to locusrius from prebutzinger and the animals became calmer and theyre eg levels changed in ways their indicative that they became calmer and as i recall they didn just become calmer but they ware not really capable of hiarowsal states they were gon of flat ni i do not think we really pur sued that in the paper o and we would have to s joined hugenon about that but i's on the other side of my laps o we will ask im but but none the less am that beautifully illustrates how there is a by direction al control right well that is alanding e motion well nothat did the two a the two stories of the locked in o m sindrum plus the yacal paper shows that the motional states influence breathing and breathing influences emotional sates it which but you mention inspiration which always call inhalation but people w will wat fallow no let us find it wi those are interchangeable on people can fallow that om there some interesting papers from nome sobles grupened from a number of other groups that as we inhale or right after we inhale the brain is actually more alert and capable of storing information thenduring exhales which i find incredible but it also make sense i'm able to see things far better when my eyes are open than when my eyelids are closed for that matter im may i do not te doubt amy non nomswork is grate im letme back track o it because i i won people on the stand that when tongue about breathing affecting emotion of cognof state it is not simply coming from prebutsinger here lit therear he least while there several of the sights leme sot of the si neette to go to them one is o faction when you are breathing norma normal breathing your inhaling and exhaling this is creating signals coming from the nesom youcosa that is going back into the o factory bulb that is respiratory modulated and thou factory balf has a profound influence and projections thro many parts of the bray this is signal arising from this rythmic moving of air in and at the nose that is going into the brain that has contained in an irespiatory mdulation that signal is there the brain does not have to be using it but when it is the syour thiscriminating odn what not that is writhing on a oscillation which is respiratory related another potential source is the vaguest nerve the vagos therve is amago nerve which is containing afference from all othe vessl afference just being a signal signals to yesignals from the visr it also has signals coming from the brains them down which are called ifference but it is getting masou signals from the long from the got and this is going up into the brain stam it is there there very powerful recept is in the long that a responding to the long volume the long stratch sor berrersthats arry that a t that will you we have an auso lik at the piazo receptors of of this years nobell prize yet thee responding to the expansion and relaxation in the long and if you record from the vagas nerve you will see that there is a huge respiratory modulation due to the mechanical changes in the long now why that is of interest is that for some forms o refractory depression a lectual stimulation of the vagest nerve can provide tremendous relief why this is the case still remains to be determined but it is clear that signals in the vagest nerve least artificial signals in the vagest nerve can have a posive effect on reducing depression it is not a lat to think that unte normal circumstances that that rhythm coming in from the vagest nerve is playing a role in normal processing or can letmme lemme continue comdoxide an oction levels now unthe normal circumstances your oxon levels are file and unless you go to altitude they do not really change very much but su seal two levels can change quite a bit with even a relatively small change in your oval ol breathing that is going to change of piage level a have a colleague a leasi maret who as working with patience to have ho anxious and many of them hi prevent telite and is a result of that hypoventilation their comdox id levels low and she as develop a thereputed treatment weare she trays these people to bread slower and the to restore thi seal two levels back to normal and she gets relief in their anxiety seal two levels which ae not gon effect brain function oner breath by breath level although does fluctuate beath by breath but sort of a continuous background can change and if it is change chronically we know that highly elevatee levels of seo to can produce panicatacs and a we do not know to gree to that is i the gets exascibated by people who get who have a panic atac te gree to which their ambian seal to levels ar affecting ther degree of discomfort what about people who are am tend to be too calm meaning that their their feeling sleepy they the their underbreathing as supposed to overbreathing is there any a knowledge of what the status of seo tu is in their system i do not know which does not mean is no knowledge but un unaware un unaway are but that is blissfully unaware i 've not looked at that literatues o i do not know but i have go any most people or excuse me most of the scientific literature around breathing in humans i'm aware of relates to these stress states because theyare lol be easier to study in the lab or as people feeling am under stimulated or exhausted all the time it is a it is a complicated thing to measure ime you can do it but it it is not our sal tois easy tomese but in terms of that s or f the the measures for feeling a fatigue theire theire somewhat indirect resstrasyou we can we can get at pulserates anach or vian thinks anso by imagine that these sir these devises that were all wearing will soon be able to measure will not a commeasure oxen level toxin saturation jisamazing yo a but oxens youn bu bretty much stay abouve ninety per cent unless their some bythology were you go to out tat but seal too levels very quite a bit and seald in fact because they very you bodys sensitive the control of breathing that how much you breathe perminute is thetermine in a very sensitive way by the sel too level even a small change in your seal too wol have a significant effect on your ventilation this is another thing that nine changes of intilation but effects your brains that now another thing that can effect a breathing prahow breathing practice can effect your motional state is simply the the sending to me because breathing practice involves volitional control of your breathing and therefore this is singlats originating somewhere ing your motor quatex that is not of course that is goingto go down the prebutsinger but it is also going to send off collaterals toa the places those collaterals could obviously influence your emotional state we have quite a few different potential sources none of them there exclusive thire's an interesting paple which shows that a few block nasal breathing yo still see breathing way oscillations n the brain and this is we are i think the the mechanism is occurring is tat these breathing way oscillations in the brain they are playing a rol in singal processme in maybe as sure totalo bit about te roll at oscillations may be playing in singa procedefinitely but before you do i i just want to a ask you a intermediate question we talked a lot about inhallation inspiration an excellation what about breath holds in apnea for insestance a people are holding their breath whether or not its a conscious or or or unconscios they are holding their breath a what is known about breath holds am in terms of how it might interact with brainstate or oxygen see o to and i'm particularly interested in how breath holds with lungs empty verses breath holds with lungs full might differ in terms of their impact on the brain i'm not aware of any studies on this a dlooking it a mechanistic level but i find it really interesting and even if there are no studies a i' love if you care to speculate well why are the breath practices that entrigue me is when you basethe hypoventilate for a minute and then hold your breath for as long as you cann to mo style wema style or ye we call it in the laboratory because frankly before to mo and before whim am there there it was it referred to as siclike hyper ventilation sos basily it followed by a brathl and that rethel could be done longs folt wer lums emity hd a long talk with some colleagues about what they might think the unlowing mechanisms are particularly for the breath hole and thi sarly coi suddenly invision that this a component with respect to the presents or absents of that rithmicity in your cuartax which is having effect but the other thing with the hypeof infilation hypoventilation wen the apnium is your seall two levels or going from lo ti any time youre holding your breath any toe you hong your breath oc and those going to have a profound influence now i have to talk about episota cypoxia cause there is a lot of ork going on particularly with going mitualto you res your floridas doing some extraordinary work on episotic hypoxia in the atiese david millhorn a this some really intriguing work if i askd you to hold your breat ato exisme if i gave you a looxian mixture for couple of minutes your breathing level would go up cuosu you would not you want to have moroxiterare ye no stone foxiti oc a and for couple of minutes you go up you can reac some study state level not hypoxic that you cannot reach an equilibrium and then i give you room mare again your ventilation quickly relax us bact down to no if on the other hand i gave you three minutes of hypoxia five minutes of nomoxia three minutes hypoxia five minutes in omoxia threements ypoxo fiments in omoxan normoxiving or no o nono there you vadilation os op down up down up down have the last episode your breathing comes down and does not continue to come down but rises again and stays up for hours this is well validated now this was orisally done an ounce rening humans all the time it seems to have profound benefit on motiv function and cognina function in what direction positive positive i've often toyed with the idea o getting of fypis and an apisen oxon do not do this lessness getting an apisen oxian tank by my desk when writing a grant and doing in blue velvet and going through the the episotic ypoxi to prove my cogne function cous certainly could due some proveen wen weri grancs but you could do this without the the low oxygen i man ye could do this o breath work presumably it is hard to lower your oxygen enough oquet were going in the experiment al studies they iply use eight persent oxygen it is hard to hold your breath long enough and there is another difference here that is what is happening to you seal two levels when you hold your breath your oxtion levels are dropping o seal to levels are going up when youare doing episotic hum hypoxia you seal two levels are going to state prettig nomal course you still breathing is sis the oxion level circle unlike anormal conditions which you describe before were e oxygen is relatively constant and seeo too is fluxuating depending on emotional state and activity in things o that sort in episotic hypoxia seo too is relatively constant but your varying the oxygen level coming into the system quite a bit i would say it is relatively i would ay seal to is relatively constant buc in but it is not going an going a direction which is going to be significantly far from nomal worse when youre holding your breath you going to become both hypoxic and hypocapnic at the same time we had explain to people wat hypoxyc an hypocaponic gar i ohas at a just a tect l tone for low levels of oxygen hyper or you could sa hypoxic lo hyper is hygh hyperoxia or hypo capia low seal to our hy purcap n your hh slevels osio to when youare in episotic hypoxia if anything you ven to become hypo capnic not hypercap and that could have plain influence in us when example that i i remember and going will have to forgive me i fo miscorting us is they had a a patient who had a stroke and had weakness an ankle flexion that is exes me ankle extension to extend the ankle and they had the patien a seat wherther can measure ankle extension and then are they measured it and then they exposed the patient to episodic hypoxia and they measure again the strength of the ankle extension wen way up and gordon is looking at this the looking this now for spinal cord rehere and i imagine for all sorts of nor muscular performance a you can be beneficial your gordon is looking in tathletic performance we have a project which we have not been able to to puston an ext level to do gulf we i i linga alf clum cause you love gulf well it is it is because it is motor performance coordination it is not simply running as faas you can an it is cordination its concentration's a whole variety of things and the idea would be to ge a group of gulfers and give them the porsuble controls to do not know where they breathing a gas mixtior which is juss normal air where i poxicos nixture though they may be able to figure it out bae on their response do it onde control circumstances that do it into a net measure there blankof contrives a dispersion wont not and see what happens look if we could find that this works for golfers forget about cognof function we could sell this for unbelievable anonts of money that is oundly i terr whi am a by the way i'm not serious about soming wer but i know your joking either mapeople should kow that you are joking by that no i think that anything that can improve cognive an ner muscular performance is gon to be of interest for a wide range of both pathologic states injury t b e et cetera i'm in one of the most frequent questions i get is about recovery from from concostion or dramatic brain injury lot of people think sports they think football i think rug by they think hoky but if you look at the statistics on dramatic brain injury most of it is construction work ors car crash is bicycl accidents i mean it the the sports part of it is a tiny tiny miniscule for action of the total amount of dramatic brain injury out there a it i think these protocals tested in the contects of gulf would be very interesting because of the constraints of the measures as you mention in it can be exported to a number of things i want it just trying imagin whether or not there is any kind of breathing pattern or breath work just to be direct about it that even partially mimics what you described in turns of eposotic hypoxia i've done a lot of tumo whimhawfsick hy peroventilation type breathing before my laps studies this in humans in a what we find is that if people do sicklike hyerovelation or for about a minute the exhale hold their breath for fifteen to sixty secons depending on what they can do and just keep repeating that for about five minutes i it seems to me that it at least partially mimics the state that you are talking about because afterwards people report heighten levels of alertness a lower levels of a cand of triggering a do to strestful events they feel comfortable at a higher level of outonomic rowsal cognive focus a number of improvementsthat are pretty impressive that any practitioner of whimhaw for tuma will be familiar with a is that pattern of breathing even can we say that it it maps to what you are describing in some general sense i well they the expin this would be goin mitual i would say it moves in that direction but its not its extreme cause i do not think youan get them to the levels of i poxi that they do clericaly a i know that ar pas at out breath collect of actually just put a machine could you by machine that does this i say and the borhtin av bing to do their own self testing to see whether not the sassany effect on anything that they can mish of course y afte be concerned about self expermentation but i am i employed their curiosity in going after it hyperberic chambers here a lot nowadays about hyperbaric chambers people are buying em enusing em and a what your thoughts on hyperbaric chambers as it relates to any that hyper a hypol hy burbaric chambers si sey not coing about out to to now i do not really have much the same a your oction etl surpoligal up a little bit and that could have beeneficial effect but that is way outside my veryer comfort i think a twenty twenty two i think it is going to be the year of two things i keep hearing lot about which is the deliberate use of high sault in take a for performance a bloot increasing blood volume et cetera and hyperoparic chambers seem to be catching on much in the same way that ice bas were in and sawn as seem to be right now but ey a prediction we can ae return to it some at some point i the one to ask you about am some of the studies that iave seen out there exploring how deliberatele restricting one's breathing to nasal breathing can do things improve memory these accouple papers in journal f noral science which is a respectable journal on our field am one looking attle factory memory that kind of made sense because you can smell things better though your nose than your mouth unless you are some sort of a elkor something they were they can presumably they have some sense of smell in their mouth as well but a human's generally smell with their nose that was not terribly surprising but there was the companion study that showed that the hippocampas and ariad volved in in coting memories in one form er another a was more active if you will and a memory and a recall was better when people learned information while nasal breathing is supposed to mouth breathing does that make sense of from any mechanistic perspective well given that there are this a major path way going from the ofectory systhem into the brain and you cut and and not one from any receptirs in the mouth the degree of respitory motulation going to see throughout the forbring is going to be less with mouth breathing than nosbring it it is certainly plausible am am i i i think there is thereare a lo lot of experments an need to be done to tistinguish between the two that is they the nas o component in the none days o component of these breathing related signals thi's is t n the see some times when you have a strong effect to be exclusive and i think what is going on here is that therer many imports that can have an effect on whether the aepossile that some effect this part of behaviour in some effect that part of be remains to be investigated the certainly astrongol factory component my interest is trying to follow the sentral component cause we know that this a strong sentral component is in fact this e strong sential projectionto the olfactory ball regardless of whether not this any ing inan ot the nose there is a respiratory in put into the ofactory bull which combines with the respiratory mosulated signals coming from the sensury resemtes interesting and as long as we are a poking around a forgive tupon a the knose a what about one nostril verseis the other nostril i know it sounds a little crazy to imagine but there've been theories in a yogic traditions and others that breathing through one nostril yesomehow active ate certain brain centers may be hemospherically one side the brain verses the other or that right nostril left nostril breathing might am a different terms of the levels of alertness or commness they produce i am not aware of any mechanistic date on that but there is anything of worth while out right nostril verse is left nostril breathing that you are weare of id love to know well it it is certainly plausible i do not know of any dated demostraning ou accept the anecdotal reports of the the as the brain is highly lateralized and we have ou speech on one side and a i knowr dominant hy in this on one side in the notion that if you you have the stue signal coming from the ofactory system and it the some degree ofs lateralize is not perfectly symmatrical that is one side is not going evenly tho both sides then you can imagine and hence the signal cets a distributed in they way that is not uniform that the effect in this or the response is going to be particular to the cuartex in which a either the signal still remains whe the signal is removed from i see a what are some of the other features of our brain and body be it blinking or ey movements or a ability to in code sounds or any features of the way that we function and move and perceive things that are cordinated with breathing in some interesting way factid for that question a almost everything we have for example on the ordinomics are we have respiratory sign of serithmia that is during expir ration the heart slows down a your pupil alcillate with the respiratory cycle i do not know what the functional basis for that is but they do ausilat wth the respiratory cycle when we inhale our pupils constrict presumablycause yeters and increase ind in harid in sympathetic tone i would think of constriction i'm guessing as you relax the pupil will get han you ex in i i think you right but i always get you now always get the availance at a onl ans counterintuitigis people wone think that when the pupils get am a ame in depends i mean w you can get very alert and arousn it for strasswor for good reasons am and the pupils get wider by your visual feel narrows and then the opposite is true anyway i d i guess the ideas that the pupils are changing size and therefore you aperture your visual window is changing in it incordination with breocane your fear response changes with the rspiratory cyce onl tell us more about that well s a paper by a thesalano which i thinks showed rather clearly that if you show individuals a fearful faces that ther we measured response of fearfulness changes between inspiration expiression yo no why but it does your your reaction time changes i took about blinking the reaction time changes between inspiration expiration your if i esk you to punch something the fime will change between inspiration an expiration in fact i do not know the degree to which marcha ouht us exploit that you watch the breathing patten and your your opponent will actually move slower during one cycel compare to themeaning as there what would in which direction if theyr exhaling they can they can punch faster i have to say i i do not keep a table of which is which thirection things movein ces a mount of the marchalantsfiel what myy a vague understanding is that exhales on strikes is the more typical a way to a to do that am and as be peopil strike they exhale a mnoa as you you exhale but th there therr arether components to strike and because won a stiff in your yur ribpage wonto make a vaw salvaman ouve a thats yu know both an inspiration in an expirations at the same time i do not i do not i do not know enough about when you say during expiration i would assume that we make you strike your actually sort of one is stiffand here which is o vasalven maneuvre and oftentimes they will clench their fist at the last moment b anyway there is a a whole set of moter a things ate wi we should we can talk to some fiters we we know people who know figters w we can ask them a interest in what are ome other a things that are modulated by breathing you i think anything any one looks at seems to have a breathing component because it is all over your brain and it is hought to imagine its not being effected now whether it is incidental or a just back round and does not really have any behavioral a advantage it is possible another case os on might have a beabal vangi men that the the bigest a i opening thing for me probably a decato go was digging into literature and and seeing how much of cortical activity and selfcoric activity had a respiratory modulated component to it and i think a lot of my colleagues whoa studying quartex or oblivious to us and a iy they find i heard a talk the other day the personal gon name who find the lot of things correlated with a a particular movement and i think it when i looked i said geeda less the things that a respiatory modulated and rather than it being correlated to the movement they were looking at i think the movement they were looking at was modulated by breathing as was everything else there was not that the movement itself was driving that correlation it was that they are oll correlated to something else which as the breathing win whether or not that is they behaviorly relevant or behaviourly something can exploit i do not know i suspect youre riht am that breathing is if not in the foundational driver of many if not all these things that it is at least one of the foundatit is itsin the fact round it is in the brain in a i oscillations playin important pot in brain function and the very infrequency from ma be a hundred hearts a down to whut wen get tho carcadian and surt a monthly cycles but breathing occupies a rather unusual place in all that because letme thought about what the otwu people think elsolatios of doing particular fastal ones there important in coordinating signals across naurant a just in a computer a computous steps computin knows when informations coming from another part of a computer that it was originated at a particular time and that tiscreet step by steplhing is important n computer contral now the brain is not additional device at's an analogue defice but when i have a signal that the coming in my ear and my eye which is intuuman in speaking and i'm looking at his face i see that is a whole but the signals coming in to different parts of my brain how do i unify that well my murans are very sensitive to changeus in signals arriving by fractions of a mill a second i d always sure that those signals coming in represent the same signal well if i have throughout my brain and oscillation and the signals right on that oscillation lat san te picaty oscillation i can then have a much better handle on the relative timing and say those thro signals came in at the same time they may relate tha the same object and a ha i see you as when unify thing spouting ou k talking and these oscillations comin many different frequency ranges and are important in memory formation in all sorts of things i do not think people pay much attention to breathing because it is relatively slow to to this a the range when you think about no a seconds but we have important the things that i thought to be important in conly function which are a few sycles per second to twenty thirty forty fifty secon te second breathing an humans is may be point two sycles per second every five seconds although in roms there up the four per second which is pretty fase but breathing has one thing which is spetial that is you can readily change it the degree to which the brain is using that slow signal for anything if that becomes part of its normal signal processing change it that signal processing has to change and as that signal processing changes acutely this a change know you ask about breath practice how long they have to do it well a signal breath will change your state your nervous you take a deep breath and it seems to help relax o your aseye call it what you will oo what you will ah it seems to work now it is not it does have a permanent change but when i'm getting up to bath or geting up tat a first teeo getting to give a big flock or coming to do a potcast get a bit anxious a a deebreath of feu depreaths a tremendously effective in coming on down and a you can get a trancient disruption but on the other hand let us take something depression i think it is you can invision depression as activities sot of going around in a sicond and because it is conchinuous in te nervous system as signals keep repeating they tend to get stronger and then get strong you cannot break it you can imagine the pression being a something going on and on on and you cannot break it and we have trouble when we get tecrtain levels of depression a m all of us get the pressed at some point but if it is not continuous its not long lasthing were able to break it but if it is long lasting and very deep we cannot break it the quessions how to we break it well theu're extreme eses to break it we could do electri convulsive shock we shock the whole brain that is destructing activity whole brain and when the circuits thoughts through get back together again it is been destructive and we know that the brain when signals get the structedal a bit we can weaken the connections and weakening connections if its then in the circuinnvolved in depression we may get some relief an electur convulsive shop shok does work for relieving many kinds of depression that is pretty heroic focal a dee brain stimulation does the same thing but more local eyes or trans crany ol stimulation you destructing a network and while it is getting back together it may weaken some of the connections it breathing it is playin some roll in this circuit and now instead of doing a te one second shock i do thirty minutes of destruction by doing slow breathing or other breathing practice the does circuits begin to break down al a bit and i get some relief and if i continue to do it before the circuit can then build back up again i grassh it can wear that circuit down i a short of likin this i tell people us walking round on a dirt path you build a rock to ruck get deep you cannot get out of it and what breathing is doing i sirt of filling in the rut it by bet to a point that you can climb out of that rut and that is because breathing the breathing signal it is playing some roll in the way the circuit works and then when you destruct it dthe circuit gets a low thrown off kilter and when as when this when circuits get thrown off the nervus system tries to adjust in some way or another and it turns out at least for breathing for some evolutionary reason or just by happens thints it seems to improve our emotional function are n or cogna function and were very fortunate that that is the case it is a terrific saguayint what i ont ask you naxed in this part of a set of questions ione may sure we touch on before we rap up which is what do you do with all this knowledge in terms of a breathing practice a you mention that one breath can shift your brainstate and that itself can be powerful i think that is a absolutely true you have also tokh about thirty minute breathbrak breathword practice as which is three mints of breathwork is it pretty serious commitment i think but it is doable a certainly a zero cost except for the time r in most cases what do you see out there in the landscape of breathwork that is being done that you i and why do you it a what do you think but what would you to see more of in terms of exploration of breath work and what do you do well i'm awewe the new cin for to breathwork through my own investigation of it i became convince that it is real and i'm i basely af beginner in terms tof my own practice and i to keep things simple and i think i've discustic an before i in it to summon as a calch potato whose told they got to begin to exercise you do not go out run a marithon you kno cauchpetan sel can get up and walk for five minutes an ten minutes and then whocan ow your working for a long a period you begin to rhyme and then you reach a point you say walgi i'm interested in this sport and there may be particular kinds of practices that you can use that could be helpful in in optimising performance at that sport i'm not vere yet i find i get tremendous benefit bi relatively short periods between five and baybe twenty minutes of doing boxbr it is very simple to do i have a simple ap which telps me keep the timing to yu recall what yapit is is it the apany a trainer is that the one whil i was usin calm for a long time but i let my subscription relapse and i have another one whose name i do not remember but a it it is it is very simple and works for me i'm now trying this tomow because i'm just curious an exploring it because of it may be acting for a different way in a wone to see if i rea i respond differently a i i do not have a particular point of yew now i have friends in colleagues or into particular styles gwimhoff and i think what he is doing as great in getting people are interested i think the notion is that i would to see more people exploring us and to some degree as you point out thirty minutes to day some of the breath patterns that a a some of y stuss gwimhwf are a little intimidating to nupi s and i would to see something very simple that whut i tol my friends i but just try at five or ten minutes if you feel better through for a few days if you do not and stop an does not cost anything and invariably they find that it is helpful i well often interrupt my thay m to take five or ten minutes a i find then a'm lay agin there is i think thers some pretty good data that your performance if te lunch te clients and very often whut i'll do if te lunch which i didn thro to day is thake five or ten minutes and just sort of breath practice and lately what th at what is that breath practice look thi's just box brealyn for five or ten minute and your the duration of your inhales and holds and exhales and holds is set by the ap i tat ra well i i do five seconds five seconds inhale five second hold five second exale five five sa and sometimes i'll do doubles ade ten seconds im t just because i i i get morei you knoi tus ii feel doing a and it is it is im it is very it is very helpful i mean it im now that is not the only thing i do with respect the trying to mantaying my sanity in my health imagi a number of things o they seem a because you seem very sane and very healthy i in fact know that you are both those things rar you suspect an ases in but there is data im a while back we had a conversation a casual conversation but you said something that really stuck in my mind which is that it might be that the specific pattern of breath work that one does is not as important as experiencing transitions between states based on deliberate breath work or something to that extent which i interpreted to mean that if i were to do box breathing with five second in five second hold five second exhale five second hold for a couple of days or maybe even a couple of minutes and thens which to ten seconds or then switch to tumo that there is something powerful perhaps in the in the transitions and realizing the relationship between different patterns of breathing in those transitions much in the same way that i you can get on to into one of these cars and amusement parkages goes at a constant rate and then stops very different in learning how to shift gears i hundered up i use to drive a manuel i still can' ser op thing about a manual transmission but even with an automatic transmission you start to get a sense of how the vehicle behaves under different conditions and i thought that was a beautiful i'm seed for a potential breath work practice that at least to my awareness nobody has really formalized which is that you introduce some varyability within the practice that' somewhat random in order to be able to sense the relationship between different speeds and depths of inhales achals ad holds and forth and essentiall its driving arou on the tract but with obstacles am at different rates and braking and restarting in things that sort that is how you learnt how to drive what you think about that an am if you a it enough can we call it the feldman protocal hoplas n i was asked om in this bebysy int of you once wide an i ame at te feldman complex said the prebusiv ccomp was it ouri hav afeldman complex wut sounds a secondatric thisorder but but a i i think the primary effect is this destruptive effect which i described and but the particular responses mey clearly very depending on what that descruption is i do not know of any particular data which are son well controlled experiments which can actually work through the different types of breathing pattens or simply with a box paten just varing the durations a min priamis ot of similar but the mount of time you spendgoing round the boxis different i i do not really have much to say about this a menhisis why we need better controlled experiments in humants and i think this is where of being able to studying in rodens where you can have a whide range of a protibations whi you doing morein vase of studies the really get down is to which regions are effect that how is the signal processing descrupted which is still hypophesis but how is descruped could tell us a lot about may be this a resinint point i which this enoptimal effact when you take a particular breathing practice and then when we talked about the fact that different breading practices could be effecting the outcomes throuh different pathways you have the ol factory pathway you have a central pathway have a vagal pathway you have a desending pathway how different practices may a change the the summation of those things because all i think all those things are probably involved and we are just beginning descrach thesurface and i i just hope that we can get serious you are scientis the psychologice to do the right experiments to get it this because i think this a lot of value to human healthiere as you do and at's when ther reasin my lavis shifted to these sorts of things in humans a delighted that youre continuing to do the hard qore mechanistic work in mice and probably you do work in humans already tha as well as you are not already and there re other groups a eppel lavit you see a saph and a number of certaing see some papers out there about respiration an human ilabits more brain imaging i cannot help but ask about a somewhat unrelated topic but it is am important in light of this conversation because you are here and one of the things that i really enjoy about conversations with you a as it relates to health and neuro science and and forth is that you are one of the few collegues i have who openly admits to a exploring supplementation imi'm a long time a the supplement u ifan i think there there is power in compounds both prescription non prescription natural synthesized a i do not use these haphazardly but i think there is certainly power and in them am one of the places where you and i converges in terms a very interest in the nervous system and supplementation is a e's a ve magnesium now i've talked at endlessly a on the podcastand elsewhere about magnesium for sake of sleep and improving transtransitions to sleep and and forth but you have a a somewhat different interest in magnesium as it relates a cognative function and durability of cogneive function would you mind your sharing with us a littlebit about what that interest is where where it stems from and because it is the because it is the humran ladpodcasting we often talk about supplementation what a what you do with that information i need to disclose as i am a signed of adviser to a company cal ner centr which my graduas then gosong leraso am that said i give you some background goson although when he was in my lamb work on breathing had a deep interest in learning amember and we left my lap he went to work for it with a renown learning memory guy at thinfrviction and when he am finish thin is hired by sosumatonicoanin mit who also knows a thing or two mo memory i'm teasing sosuma has a no bell for his work on imuniglobulance but then is a the world class memory researcher and more am he is many things and and osng had very curious very bright gi and he was interested in how signals between norans get strength and which as co long competeniationaltp and one of the the questions that arose was if i have implet us to a noran and i get eltip is the eltip bigger if the signal is bigger or the noise is less we can imagine that on e listening to something of its latter we can hear it better orth this less noise we can hear it better and he wanted to investigate tus i did this in tissu culture of hypohypocampal nurans and what he found was that if he lord the background activity in all the nurans that the elty p he elisitid got stronger and the way he did that was increasing the level of magnesium in the bathing solution this gets into some esoteric a electrophysiology but basically this a background level of nose an onerans and that part of it is regulated by the degree of magnesium in the exerciry of beath a youman x a you mean electrical noise bloxwil not om soleton and if you inin what is called the physiological range which is between point aite and one point to million mouler which do not worry about the nolremember the mili moler of the magnesy vil i i always frightene that i get in i say micro or phanto or something i go off by sevilesa magnetir but a in that physiological rane this a big difference in the amount of noise in the nuron between poinade in one point to milimo ke playedamound with the magnesium man yo found out that when th magneium is elevated tite was more eltipi i that is an observation in a tisu culture and i should just mention that more elty p essentially translates to more mera plasticity more rewiring of connection inescence he am tased this in mice and basely offor them a am y had control mice which can anomal died in whon that had on the richa magnesium and the ones that lived a in rich wild magnesium had high a cognet of functionan a live longer everything you would worn in some magic pill thos mice thid that when iexie rats a the problem was that you could not imagine taking this into humans because most magneium saults do not passively get from the got into the blood stream into the brain they pass by a wat's called a transporter transportes something in the membrane tha grabs a amagnsium molecule adam and olsin in to the othe side if you imagine you have mgnesium in your got you have transportus that pulle magnesiment got into the blood strey well if you had taken nomal magnesium supplement thich can buy at dephomacy it dosn't crosse the got very easily and if you wald take enough of iat to get it in your blood stream yous thot getting diarea it is not a a a good way to go wha is 't it wa igocanelis ah well said a he work with this brilliant chamis famow and a fa lookd the whole range of magnesemen compounds and he found tha magnesium three and eight was much more effective in crossing thi the a got blood baria now they denerealize at the time but three and eight is a metabolite of vinim in sea and there is a lots of three nating your bodye magnesium three n ht with appear to be safe and maybe a part of the roll or that now they believe its part the role of the three and eight is that it supercharges the transport it to get the magneciun in and remember you knea a transporter at the got into the brain and intesells the gave magnesium three n aht to mice a who had a no lime back trick of it they did a study in umans they hide a a accompanied to do a test was a hansoff test that is whenthes companies to gets tied by the befama to do their testodem and they got patients who had what diognos this mile cognof decline these are people had connive this order which was ageant appropriate and the the matric that they use for a determining how far off they were is esperman's chief factor which is a met generalized measure of intelligence that most psychologist except and the biological age of the subjects wes i think fifty one nd the cognent of age was sixty one based on the spamin jesus i should say the spmangy factor stoughts at a particular popular a level in the population at aged twente and declines about one percenta year sorry to say wer not twenty year olds any more a but when you get a number from that you can put on the carvancy whether it ur its about youration not these people about ten years older according to that metric and longstor short if the three months this is a bosibo control double blind study the people who were in the posebau arm improved two years which is common for human studies coes of besibo effect the people who got the compound improved eight years on average and some improved more than eiht years they did not do any further dic nosis is o what corsi ma copnecy but was pretty it was extraordinarily impressive it move their cognition closer to their bya aage i logical age m o what the dosis of magnesium three and it is ai it is in the paper and it is spasically what they have in the compound which is sold commerciallin the compound which is sol commercially is i enthe by a nutr suitacle whole sailor who sells it to the retailers an the makewat of a formulation in want am but im it is it is a dosage which is mindhes thing is rarely tolerable i take hafodose the reason i take carfodosis that i had my my nesium blood manecion measure and i it was lo nomal formy age i took hafodos o became high nomal and i felt comfortable thing in the normal range im but younow te lot of people a taking the full dose and an a for it my age i'm not looking to get smaughter iofm looking to the clime more slowly and it is hard as n i sart for me to tell you whether or not its effective or not will you remember the mimoleor and esya men a solution and on the high and lad i would say i it is not a well controlled study a when it is an end of one but i it seems to be working i when i when i've recommendet to my friends academics who are not by nature sceptical if not synical and i insist that they try it they usually do not report hey major change in the cogniv function of thos sometimes they do report while i feel a little bit more lurt than mi move my physical movements are better but many the report the sleep better an an that make sense i think a there is good evidence that three an eight can a excelery the transition into sleep and maybe even access to deeper a modes of sleep i for some people there a for many people actually a a small percenage of people who take three and eight including one of our podcast staff i her a have stomach issues with it they cannot tolerates i would say am just anecdoely about five per cent of people do not tolerate three and eight well istop taking in than their fine it cause them diary or somethingin that sort i but most people tolerate it well and most people report that in it vastly improves their sleep and again that is anecdote ly there are a few studies and thei'r more on the way im but dit is that is very interesting because i until you and i had the discussion about three nd ahte i was not am aware of the a cognive enhancing effects but the story make sense from a machanistic perspective and it brings it around to a a bigger and more important statement which is that i appreciate your attention to mechanism i guess systems from your early training as a physicists and the desire to get numbers and

yesterday there is a big announcemen from the house intelligence committee the house intelligence comittee chair when on acts and treated out a statemen suggesting that there is a serious national security threat the american public had to be made aware of this free to everybody out because you make vague national security related threats and you suggest that they are serious s enough the the nee to be classified everybody starts to have a little bit of palpitations but as it turns out what exactly was happening here it appears that there is intelligence seggesting that russia is going to attempt to put newkes in space newins spe according to sienan dot com thou us has new intelligence on russian military capabilities related to its efforts to employ a newclear anti satellite system in space according tomultipal sources familiar with the intelligence tintelligence was brief to congress and keuus allies some wawmaker a sade is serious enough it should be declassified and made public apparently is not immediate threat the ussians have an acually done it yet the sys tem is under development is not yet in orbit and its not even clear how farthe tecnology has progressed according to one of those official there are few issues the ean to coveryor one is wha would t mean if russia actually were to do the second is why we finding out about this now not when its actually about to happen or when it has happen there is something a little bit funny about that politically speaking let us talk about what exapctly this wou mean first it means that presumably there would be a serious threats to america is satellite communications tecnology all of our satellite anology period if you were to detinate a newc in space it does not exactly have the same ramifications s if you detinate a newclear weapon at high altitude for example if you detinate a newclear weapon at high altitude that comes o the possible threat of mpe redelect tro magnetic pulses which could take out trial of your electronics you'v seen some ofthe con of horror movies bout that possibility if you detinate a newclear weapon close to the ground obviously devistate the immediate area around the blast and then there also radiation clouds that travel and callossif people if you detinate in space one of the things abat a newclear weapon is that a neclear weapon feeds on the air around it o is the explosion requires oxygen in order for it to continue expanding if you do it in a vaccuem if you do it in space it does not have quite the same impact deffectively what you do is you blast out radiation and that radiation is going to significantly damage or degrade pretty much all o the satellites within the immediate orbit and is going to crate a sor perennial hot spot in that place where satelites that pass through it are going to be significantly damage s good piece tbe liutenant colonel tony vincent whos an active doty scientist in the us air force as well as the director of advance physics courses at the air force academy and he wrote this piece back in september of twenty twenty two talking about what exactly would happen if you dedonated a newclear weapon in space and what he says is that the threat of newclear explosions in spaces martianalized beas the potent y of their efects is not widely known and the likelihood of newclear attack in spaces assumed to be negligible but tht assumption is wrong what he says is that effectively speaking what would h appen is newking the economy it would really be more of an economic attack than see a physical attack killing millions o people for example what he rights is he says a newclear explosion spaces jus proportionately hurts the united states as the largest single investeran spates capabilityes the united states nets almost two hundred buillion dollars pret year of real gross output from its space ases even though military satelites are designed to with stand a harsher charged particale environment radiation hardening is not a magic cloak of inventibility military spaces assets will be degrated over time from the artificially ampt radiation belt created from the neclear's etonation meanwhile commercial satellites in low erth orbit will be the first to fail from continually passing through these particle hotspots most satellites of the line of sihtes to the newclear's detonation would be destroyed from the resulting axts rades military spaces capabilities for commanding control along with reconistant ascets may function for a period following the detonation but the economic impact of degraded informational space products will be immediate another words the the things the're not shielded up there can get fried almost immediately they'l degrade really fast and tatwll have presignificant economic impack now does that mean that the united states would then be in world wor three newclear war caus we were not talking about here is the russians putting presumably newclear weapons up there in order to fire a newfrum space at the united states for example you talk met them putting a newclear wepon up there in order to do economic damage that your state under significant pressur russia is economically speaking or ins froms of security and your best indirect approach to really escalite things without killing a lot of people because if they kill lot of people than the united states really will have to on leshiuts war machine against the russians which we have not done far despite all foolishness to the contrary the united states has yet to one leisue its actual war machine against russia if it had we would not be tongue bout war in neucrane any more would be tongue bout something far larger and whet's be real about this te united states military capacity put aside newclear weapons is why mutuallyasure destruction exists the use military capascity is much larger than that of the russians rnot tongue at any of that right owle we are talking bout is if the russians were to actually fira newcat the united states that is not the same thing as newking a bunch of satellites and spaces which would do economic damage and would presumably come along with in escalation of american efforts against russia short of newclear weapons the the real question here is when you look at this capability yat is that a risk of course that ista rists is that something that the ouess militarys should game out a hundred per cent should you try to figure out ways of hardening ore satellites or replacing them with new satellites thet ar significantly were hardened to this risk sure but is this the kind of serious national security threat that requires everybody did go on panic mote for a full day yesterday where everybody is thinking all my got i need my bunker where is my bunker findneg to do my nit dropen and tuck exerciseis from the nineteen fifties get under my dast can wait for the newclear explosion well no that is not what this threat means kind of at all which raises the other question which is exactly wy was this made into a giant threat and there a lot of people who are quite suspicious of why this was made into a giant threat i'm among them ll

man of aht has to be sixty billin dollars i do not think that that that bill that has been put for by the senate i's retically wonderful bilit includes ten billion dollars of aid to the gos a strip which is filled with people who presumablye would be in positions of administration who are quar terris tre there is a lot that is wrong with that bill but as a general proposition i do not believe that the united states has an interest in allowing russia to simply walk into keeve and take over the entiredy of you cran i think that has significant negative sheo political ramifications for the united states and american citizens wit that said scaring the american people it is a green lighting an aid package by releasing in formation about a serious national security threat that lives in canada but know you cannot meeter that that does not seem a great tactic to get people in your corner in fact it is pulging a alienate more people than it draws according to seanen whele members of congress down play the immedioucy of the threaten anti satellite weapon place an orger round the arth would pose significant dangers to just newcley ar command in control satellites according to hans christianson director of the nuwcler in formation profic at the federation of american scientists earlier on wednesday the chairman of the house intelligence commttee republican at mygh turner of ohiway nighted a fire sorm on capital holl when he issued at that cryptic statement announcing that the panal had put information concerning a natioral a serious national security threaten when thits when this notice went out by the way i was watching and my imediate mentality went to ocas there an immediate terror threat in the united states that we need to know about is there about to be a major secondary attack by the russians on saabaltic saylic what woatare we talking about here and then it turns out that what there talking about is the possibility of a new russian military capability that would do economic damage to te united states but would not actually launch us in to world wore three and iegot b that seems a little bit overblown in from just leaking that out there to scare everybody with an hour is the re publican how speaker my johnson a tempted to tamp down the situation telling reports quot there is no cause for alarm he said that yof known about the in telligence since it least january he said we want was sure every one that said he hands ar the weel workin on it and there is no need for alarm jim hines the committees at topdemocratsed to statement the classfieht intelligence product the house intelligence comitee called to the attention members last night is a significant one but it is not in fact a cause for panic the national security advise or jec sulvan he said u know i cannot say that americans have nothing to worry about but i'm not sure why everybody a sort of impanic mode just a quick poligis put this to rest obviously the house intelligence a cherispigot boty if that err does not say if it serious national security threat the lackeger go to say hing has the potentioal to rase distress for some americans in the simplest of terms can you tell americans that there is nothing they have to worry about ry owlengerms of what he describes ae national security hreat wok i think in a way that question a it is impossible to answer with the straiht yes right because americans i understand that there arrange i threats and challenges in the world that were dealing with every single day and i thos trest te challenges rrange from terrorism to state actors and we have to contend with them we have to contend thet with them in a way were we insure the ultimate security of the american people me again when iht when i see yon this sort of alarm ism emerging that makes me less likely to support a foreign adbill now i again were i in congrss i'm not sur how i vote on this fore in abill i probably vote now base on the size and scupe of it and i'd want to see the underlying in formation but even where i inclineg to vote for the foreigna bill i now be less inclined vote fot foreigna boks thit do not pressure tactics this apparently according to political it is possible that turnel was attempting to raise alarmsbell rushes advancements in space as we have under scoring the need for wal makers to approve additional a u grane the senate passe the supplemental bill including sixty billion dollers an aide for keeve and is colonelly under a view by the house now meanwhile the white house is trying to play a bit of a different game with regard to this foreign adbill they are not negotiating it not at all in fact jobidon said yesterday that he hass no plans to me with speaker of the house which as were if you want to get something don on foreignaiht presumably you would want a meet with the person with whom you are going t haves negotiate to get that done corenson piers at nonon in nin know jobin is not meting with him seo johnson has to gestet and hen one on one being has iit ifn that has nas that he does not yo ri on o oregna whut that one on one meei how i mean look and i appreciate the question jos but the president met with i met with obviously congressional leadership less than a month ago just less than a month ago and he made really clear how important it was to get that by partisan a negotiated legislation coming out of the senate how importan it was to get that to move that forward cake why will not ing you the johnson than if h if he thinks that it is really important why not try to convince johnson i mean first wall be good politics good good objects an he could come out to co sailisan i spoke with seaker johnson and i he does't hae a coherent defense of his lic it is very weird that bidon will not speak o him the reason the bide mon't speak to him is because he thinks for some odd reason that he is winning this thing in the in the quart of public opinion and or he knows that the headline coming out of any meeting between bidin and johnson is likely to be about his sinility not about johnson's positions on this particular issue meanwhile the bi dministration is is trying to ramp up the pressure from the outside sogjusting that if you wanted to paraback to bill or if you would amendments to the bill or if you ought in to pass a slightly diffrenversion of the bill its strips out sertain things and adds other things that this would somehow be a jiant failure john curby who is the national security spokest person for the whitehouse he says his time for my johnson to show some leadership and simply put up the bill for vot but that is not actually johnsons job he does not have to do tht obviously he speaker of the house i do not think it is any secret some repocans ong the house of acknowledge that if the sgit outs of the floor thes there is more than two hundred ahint boats it just thi to be put on the floor have you gies worked through plan bes or other ways to try and get around a speaker who said unequivocally this aslabit it is not about getting round the speaker fo th it is about workin it is about workin with him and through him and he is goon to have to show some leadership here obvious thy were in to keep ar consultations o our conversations the conver congress goin were get where i was to get to keep engaging them but the speaker's got a choice to make hare this is wis is a moment for leadership this is as the president said an inflection point aand it is a it is i we got awaitin safe the speakers can be up to that moment no again i think of this a bad tactic of the actio oning at the aid pass what they should do is sit down with johnson he is the person they hafto negotiate with began i thing a lot of this is grand standing right now our political system is entirely broken because there is more incentive in both sides gran standing than in actually getting things done and that is true across the isle pretty much everywhere because the sides hate each other much that any signe tat you want to work with the other side on anything evento get eighty person of what you want is now treated as a sign of treason in some way wit is more on this in just one second first during this new yearts importanto slow down and think about how we can lift up and help other people because of t e economic to cline high on employment skyrocketing food prices too many families have little or no access to food for their kids many business is and informal economies day labor and local markets have eliminated jobs are close permanently leaving a lot of people with no eighter and money local ministry partners feeding centres hospitals an schools are experiencing rising numbers of mol nourishe kids but thereis a way that we can help for for forty years food for the poor has serves communities throughout the carobean and latin america through a network of trusted ministry partners and local churches food for the poor supplies non perishable food items in proching rich meals to kids and family suffering from hunger with the help of their generoustoners thet able t provide food housing health car education fresh water emergint to relief and a lot more how can you help thanks to a meal for mel match adonation of eighty box can feed two children for an en tire year a hundred sixty boxs would feed four kids three hundred twenty bos would feed eight kids your generous gift to day could change the courseofa life dona now text plates to fifty one five f ive five or i visiting food for the pord out orgslash ofpero that is plates to five wone five five five or food for the or dot orgslash of pero the demcrats are simply in a demogogue this thing without sitting down and trying to see what they can get out of the republicans cran john pierre she is saying that republicans are siding with pooten and arond which again a was an i wish that republicans at aur ticulate better theire reasons for opposin the bill because you are seeing as i've discussed on h show pass you days a wide variety of ration ous of tom cotton whose extremely hawkase extremely antiron extremely antipouten tom cotton the senator from arkansaw and he is said that he is opposeing the bill becaus of all the pork in it and because it provide to aid to some places we do not want the aid going and i gruwith his ration ells and then you see some people are making the argument that basically you craned uesn't deserve defence at all and democrats oure jumping on to that argument and then they are using that as to standin for te entire republican arguments the lack of unity an a message from republicans about why they oppose the bill is actually giving an opening to demo crats to claim the republicans opposed the bll bicause t ac tioun ladiner poten house republicans are still at it right now fighting with donor tro vatinipotent enteron against our defense industrial bate against nato against crane against our interest in the in the pacific lack of clarity an messaging is not republicans friend here they have now offered a bunch of diffrent rationells for why they opposed the bll the really ned to come around one rational originally the rationall is we oppose the bill because we want borderr control provisions in the bill and then when the border control provisions that came out ofthe senate were in sufficions they said we do not want any border contrl provisions and the bill because jobiden has the authority do wt he wants right now tey well if that was the argument in the first place then why link it to border provisions in the bill and why not pass a version in the house that already has border provisions in the bills that people arn kan shooting in the dark it feels the republicans in the house are moving around the bull posto lot just to be honest with you from the outside if you are just somebody whose watching this casually what it looks is republicans it said ok we want some nou crant worckit with some you cranad r but with t isral a rti wan aid but we are not goin to give all this money away until we secure our southern border and to the senate said okifon organ put together this entire crat package including border stuff and then the republicans houselr with that is insufficions and the senate was well then wills just strip out the boarder stuff ad well do just the eid package alone and thn the republicans whale there is not boarder stuff in there ook it whall iffrenin do that though you actually ought to do in the house is doe what the house was design to do initiate the legislation initiate the legislation and safe the senate will not pass our version of the legislation not signing anything else our version is better their version is worse do that but it seems republicans cannot really even get on board for that because e internal divisions over things aid for you crane it turns out that republicans do not have unified positions democrats do tdemocrats have unified position on pretty much all of these issues their unified posiion is as open borers as you can make them lots of aid to ou crane the actully are in favor of eigt tis ra buthey also want aid to commoss that is the actual democrat unified position tdemocrats are way better at the scame than republicans republicans are by in large a fragmentory group it is a coalitioenal group democrats or pretty much down the line you will haenan occasional person whose crazy resheeted to leav who no one can get on board including democrats me thes toall praise term preten that she is diverse part of their coalition while she literally voted yesterday she voted presens on a resolution to condemn homoss for raping women that is what er sheted to leab was doing it yesterday here she was yesterday all acts of sexual violence are horific we should all be fighting to ende here at home and are all around the world wall the resolution on the for to day rightfully denounces anysecual violence by hemath i'm disturbed that it completely ignoret an aracit any sectual violent in abuth committed by the trailly forces against palistinians especiually childric the you an and yous ac a violence an of use committe and e chosrm for years for congress what tid nothing never cared we all have her fan she sal te terror ton ouersect u she she is not an she is ritdiculous terror suboarding horrific human bein even democrats look at recheted to lead for the most part and think that she is a crazy person but they are much more unified just in terms of their governing strategy than republicans are nwhnt that means is that because republicans are unable to come up withthe governing strategy because they cannot hact o unify over virtually any issues other than simply opposing what the left wants ti's a real problem bhet's i pos ild left wance also but i want a unified republican in genda on the table on each of these things hat i think there is in eighty per sent can sensis among republicans not the omine republicans among republicans generally for the following things enough aids you crane to prevent rush off from taking keive allowing enough time for negotiated solution that freezes the lines in place sto actually be reached and enough pressur on the russians sthaid they do not feel that to morrow they aregan be able to run in to keep if they just hold out long enough the way the talaban hold out long enough nafganison than took thewhole country i think most republicans are 'n favor that i think the vast matority of republicans are in favor of atisre i thinkthe vast matority f republicans are in favor of securing the border start with that and then put for to bill that and then force as much of that through as you can in the senate that' be the way to do it but instead republicans seem to be saying things o k here is what we want these things now go try and do that and then somebody else tries to do it thy doa badly and their pungsin note when i can a look at it and then they say we want something differgen but what is the thing you want that is different what is it it cuts a way it the actual seriousness of te real republican an junitem speaker of the house mie johnson for example yesterday he said when i can get jammed into passing this foreignad bill that does not secure the boarder but it was many republicans wore claiming that your bidn does not need any more legislation orr to secure the boarder me among them by the way she does not he can secure the border right now given the laws tet r on the books youf she do not need further border legislation in order to insure that the boarder is closed every one knows this including republicans that is why it is always been a littl be weird to suggest that they are not going to pass a foreignad package unless they get again they are bunch of argments against the forenay package some are actual fiszcol arguments that are made by people tomas massy or ran paul who suggests basically we should not to forenahts anyone i take hem a little more seriously than people who i think are fronting on that whyr purfectly fine with giants an titlement programs that completely bankrupt the us economy but they are very keen not to give fornade to israel fr etample but there' certain people granpall who is a just a small government guy wants to restructure intitlements and all the rest tand says general prerspective on this presumably is that we should not spend money in places we should not spend money that tat that is fine and that standy but that is not the actual position of the republican cacas ot this point which has itself refused to restructure entitlements in any way shape per form did that a babyes heart begins to be to just three weeks at five weeks it

popularity of the democratic party re publicans are cruising for bruising november i thin eople are whistling past the graveyard i mean the donal trumpets cruising frorbruising right now he is set to win election over jobiden if the election were hell to day i'm out in the house there is a better than average shot that re publicans lose the house in november because of their own in coherence in in competence here is speaker my johnson talking about the bill and time at the border and agan if you do not put ford your affirmative position people start to think that it is just chaos which a kind of is last night the house voted to a prove articles if impeachment agains sectory mayorcas desperate times call for desperate measures we have to do that he is addicated his responsibility he is preach the public truss in thes disregarded the laws cogusis pass but but mush more has to be done of course to secure the border and what the senate produced this week is silent on that issue senator ma conal and i've spoken about this in frank sessions and let me be clear here again this morning he republican let house we will not be jam to perforced in to pass in a forein age bill that was o pose by most republican senators and dos nothing to secure our own border it is time for washington to start showing some love to americans poln tin to day this a good day to point this soutneed listen to the american people an their needs and take action that is why house leadership will continue to govern with americans interest at heart i'll get pass mist f really passhim stuff for example the house did pass a clean foreign aid bill to israel but only through ommittee that in put it up for a fulvote yet do that forcedemocrats hand wag make democrats say what they are for right now democrats are sayng what re publicans are for why republicans make democrats ay what democrats are for at this point becaue the truth is what democrats our for at this point is basically opening up the boarders if you take a look at what they are now considering apparently ice has drafted plans releas thousands of themocrans and slash its capacity to whold detaineese after the failure o the senate border bill democrats were not claiming that here is a short age of resource at the bord republicans wor then when republicans killed the bill democrats are now claiming that they take republicans claim seriously and now that are jus going to release on mass people into the united states they are actually threatening american security because the republicans would not pass ther boarderbill which by the way should be a petty god republican talking point s anotherwords you will not secure the border and your threatnot to secure the border is that if we do not join you you re going to further on secure the boarder by that that seems a a pretty good place for republicans to come around but again it is all convoluded and discombobulated in terms of co ordination at the top levels there is a lack of congressional leadership and the congressional leadership that there is is in capable of getting its own party into line in democrats are way better at this than republicans period and of story according to the washington post the by partisan borderbill republican lawmakers o pose last week wout have provided six billion dollars and supplemental funning for ice in forcemen operations the bills demise has led ice officials to begin circulating an internal proposal to save money by releasing thousands of detainese and cutting to tension levels from thirty eight thousand beds to twenty two thousand beds the opposite of the enforcemen increase is republicans say that they want now agan if youre telling you that they cannot find any money anywhere and that seven trillian dollar budget to maintain beds bylethr better not even ful the releasing people right now into the interior after a very short period of ton that isnan amazing black mal attempt by the democrats here trying to basiclly blackmell republicans in to going along with an open border and threatening them with an even more open boarder if they do not do its e that that is trul in amazing thing in republicans would be able to run on that if these issues were disaggregated which they kind of should be i'm not in favor of omnibos packages i've never been in favor of omnibos packages i want each one of these measures passed on its own merits then we can decide whether the amount of a tw crane is appropriate or whether it is not byt theamount of eigh to israel is appropriator whethe it is not but theamount of agt tiwon is appropriator and and what should be done on the boarder buet nsad we jus to aggregate this stuff andthen we argue ranimly over and then nothing gets done and meanwhile the world goes on the open border goes on the word nou crane goes on the war an gaza goes on wet's more on this in just one second first are you struggling with back taxes are unfiled

com slash cippiro and meanwhile closer to home the superbole was celebrated on sunday as to celebrated his defensio is essentially the the only national holiday we have left since the left has declared the thanksgiving is actually a a day of reminiscence about the evils of european colonization of the continent and that july forth is actually about the evils of american whites tou premisi an all the rest of it e superable sunday is really the only national holiday we have left which says not very much about our common culture frankly a hundred and twenty for million people watch the superble the otherday and then there is the superable victory parade the superable victory parade happening cans city of course caus the chiefspeak to forty nineors but a mass shooting broke out at the superable parade according to the sun the victory parade four the canicity chiefs second straiht superable championship is now ended in tragedy police reported that chotsman fired your union station and aske fans to leave eurocian un covering it yesterday joshigan were looking lit of images a earlier to peare that long forcemen a was moving folk surround in a certain area but it is really hard to discern exactly what is happening just paced on the images that were seeing what are you hearing from long forcement sources about what happened there ab wor there was this claring proscess officy that took place after these shots rang out officers trying to get i this large group of people who had been gathered for thi celebration out of the area were just hearing from authorityese coming in just now that it pears as though i at least two people hav been taken into cuscity is work pointing outright now though no indication of any any victims police said that they were working to i gather in formation to agan we jus want a coution iad still two early determined whether reports of shots fired here actually a were related to this celebration or with whether this was just happening near by o case police are still trying figure out exactly what the motives are the fact that we do not know the identity of th sutor an the police clearly to him and we have pictures floating ound a line of the identities of the shooter and the police will not release that whenever the police are very reticence to release the identity of a person implicated n to murder you can fairly guarantee thet politics are coming into play according to s an end police are working to figure out who open fire and why after one person was killed in twenty more wounded at the end of the candcity chies superable victory rally schildren were in fact among those shot at a million people were gathered wednesday just steps from uni in station in downtown cansa city three people were detained and on specified number of guns at were recovered as the officers con verge now it is fair to point out at this point thet kansa city is one of the more unsafe major cityes in the united states they have serious crimerates last year the actually had the most homicides ever in in the city of can city it is a deeply ununcsafe city at this point high rates a poverty highrates of crime hihrates of single motherhood which related both of those things meanwhile this mediately sent democrats into their gun control call the this always what happens if there is a shooting its never about gangs it is never about single motherhood it is never about higrates of crime it is never bout under staffing of the police department it is always about guns as though you can just get rid of guns across the united states with a magic wand or something here is democratic represent of jasent crow o colorado calling for more gun control because the zult it is always more cowbell for the democrats whenever somebody gets shot it is the faull tof the instrument not to fall to the person then gotn violence in this country is not being resolved even dospite the steps that hav ben taken by by long makers that wen the cansteps the very small steps what means to be done well my heart is braking for cansa city and and futher the victims an their familys i this isa terrible devastating incident no doubt about it we have a crisis in our nation there there is no reason why almost forty thousan americans a year should be dying it the hands afe got just as the uiquelly american coble i nobody else

reelect apparently your member during his terrible press conference at la st week jobdon got very angry a very angry because of the special councils suggestion that he could not remember one sundied and he did a whole stake met how terrible it was that he was even asked the questronmember how dary youvenask the question how dol deary hovo deary rais that remember that memory said that last wee does last rido i as last thurs actually rememer that it was it was great well now in emergas that actually he was never asked that question why bo bidon came up because jobidon will bring him up in any context as his get out of jo free card for literally everything according to enmy sinews quote her never asked that question according to two people familiar with first five hour interview at the president over two days last october it was the president not her or his teen who first introduced bobidon's death they sad bydon raised his son'sdeath after being asked about his work flo at a virginia rentel home from twenty sixteen to twenty eighteen when gost rider was helping him wrigte a memor about losing bo to brain cancer in twenty fifteen investigators had a twenty seventeen reporting showing that bydan had told the gost rader he found classified stuff in that home bidon began trying to recall that period by discussing what else was happening in his life thers tha that poin in theinterview he appeared confused about wen bo died bydon got the date correct but not the year presumably he was trying to use that as an excuse for why he was confused and upset but it was twenty seventeen and actually bo had died already a couple of years prior and was bidon who raised it and then blamed her for asking the question yot things are not going well for jobid he happens to be by the way just an awful i mean i gi say it all the time he really is at garbage president in fact jobidon to day announced that the department of homeland security is going to shield palistinians in the united states illegally from deeportation and looson work requirements to fundle them into american jobs he provided most palistinians in the united states with quote deferred in forcement departure for least eighteen months memoradam in sures that most palistinians cannot be to ported from the united states over the ext year and a half also d chus is in is advize to h offer employment for non citizens whose removal has been deferred for the duration of such de ferl and loosen regulations for palistinians in the united states on efhonstunvees as can hold a merican chobs if you overstinorvisa by you palicinian now jobin wants to keep you her indefinitely now all of hus again is a pandr to deerborne michigan that is what he is doing he thinks he is going to lose michigan and the only way tha hes can a maintain michigan is by pandering super duper hard on the israel palistinian issue which presumably is also why he is now attempting to push forwrd a qon e quat peace plan that would effectively amount to endless war in the region b una latterally proposing a palistinian states to another word he gets a killed twelve hundred juse and o get a state is the new logic from the bid administration there was no palistinian state prior that because there is no actual governing body in the westbankorn the gos a strip that 's not a gin terro group ther're no actual borders the is noactual econ a me there is nochel rule over those arias in any serious sens by any of those governing bodies which is why but kill twelve hundred jews in jobidnall give yo state is logic according to the times of israel the united states in several ara partners are preparing a detaild plan for a comprehensiv pieacstil beteen israel and palistinians that includes a firm time line for a palistinian state now i'm not shure exactly how you would have a firm time line for a palistinian state given the fact that you would have to hit markers for that time line such as not teaching all your kids to murders many jhuss humanly possible which is exackly what is taught in palistinian schools unfortunately offichals told the post that they hope to make the plan public once israel commossegree to a temporary truces aims at allowing humanitarian aid in togaza and freeing the hossage is still held by the tair group in the strip during that report during the paus steps would be taken tward implementation of the proposal including forming the intrum palistinian government that could also rule over gossic good luck on all the zul pi in the sky nonsense but that is jobi te stick pinisky nonsense he is incredibly incredibly bad at this particular job meanwhile in the funniest story of the day member rachel dolaal rachel dolasall was the lady who pretended that she was black for years and years she ad changed her name to n katchy d'alo after being publicly smeared and actually exposed not smeared as rachel dolas are she is a white lady from lie kansas and shed pretended to be a black lady and then sheed actually become the head of the spik can washington and doublacy payor something and then she is exposed for all that an became a national punch line obviously well then she became a teacher and now lementary scool in arizona because that is who you would invite is a crazy person to teach her small children elementary school apparentely well it turns out nashe ben fired again why whet because she had and only fans account it turns out that not only is she a crazy person maskuratings a person ofanother race also she is prostituting herself on ol evends that is griat according to the school district we only learned of miss nekatchy d'alos only fands at social media post yesterdy afternoon she 's no longer employed by the cattalng o foothills school district apparently i mean talk about a life story here dialo i do love that we just you ranimly go with peoples nu names genders al the respet deallo lost heroll teaching african studies at eastern washington university and launch an account on only fands in twenty twenty one after struggling to find work she made six hundred post in the year since and shered hundreds of pawalld dold vidios and photos that that is t a life story that is going very poorly ithat that particular life storye best of luck to rachel dolasall in all of her newest efforts meanwhile donal trump his legal drama continues the trum state prosecutions or apparently reaching a a cind of turning point in two separate cities you have got the the cuourt going in new york and als have the court going in lanto georgia according t sianen trump is expected to show up in court in new york for procedural hearing ahead of that trial over the hush money payment to stormy daniels remember that this is alvan bragg's idiotic prosecution of donal trump for a for a state charge on the basis of violation of federal campaign finance law all about how he should have declared as a campaign finance expenditure his payment to stormy daniels or some such nonsense it is out it is ebsel garbage ses can be in new york at that evidentiary hearing and then meanwhile a judge is holding an evidentiary hearing in fulton county georgia because district atturny fanny willis was stoping the prosecutor whooshe hired who had no acturalprosecutorial experience according to the associate o press should district atturny fanny willispire move from the george election interference case against donal trump because of her personal relationship it a special prosecutor lawyers were set to battle over the questions uring hering in atlanta on thursday willis the d a for george's fulson county had hired nowsid lawyer named nathan waihes help investigate whether trump in his allies committed crime twill trying to overturn his twenty twenty election loss in the state waight is led the tean prosecuting the case since an indictment was returned in august if she were removed it would seriously diminish the chance is of trump's conviction in that particular case not only and wou lookd a political prosecution not only that would certainly telay the trial to be on the election well done fanny willis for effectively getting trump off in that particular caseman that liss in that cases also a bochery the the the legality behind the case makes no senses we explain many times on the shoup but fanny willis is not that thats that is letting trump off to hook tare it is that fanny willis was stuping the guy that he hired and with the taxbar money that that that is a bigger problem and i thing the democrats hopes that donald trump is going to somehow be defeated by his legal cases i i find that very hard to believe and right now if the election were held to day donal trump wood win that is the reality of the situation right now when you look at the general election donal trump is up by a point and a half in th real cropozixpulling average it is lot closer than should be considering his running against o dead person but the last several poles have trump up four five two biden up one trump up one tie very very close election obviously but if donal trump is within one point of jobidon the likelihood is that he will win the election eitherway remember he lost to hillery clinton in the popular vote by a significant percentage an he still won the election at this point in time should be worth noting in last two election cycles jobidon was up almost six points in the real copozix plling average and hillery clinto an twenty sixteen was up almost five points in the real cropolitic plling average meanwhile donal trump to day is up a point and a half bad news for democrats already gis the rest of the sho continues right now we will be jumping into the vaunt tad beenshiperosho

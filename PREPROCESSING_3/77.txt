the showsponser baexpress ve pienas time to stand up against bictak protector dadat expressing piantacam flash men this week the metropolitan police in london wrevidio take removing postsers with pictures of hossages taken by camas the posters were being removed from colomore chemist in edgeware the chemists s yo hasana can recently retreated post branding israel and the ideec filthy animals and encouraging aron an hasbola to attack israel this naturally caused some properly earned onxst after all the removal of such posters has become the omain of antisanits across the world what was the police's excuse froremoving the posters they explained quote bost people who reported the posters to us were concerned that would escalate an already tense situation officers went to the shop and acting in good faith they remove the posters in an effort to prevent any such uscalation we do not wish to limit the rights of anyone to protest or to raise awareness of the plagt of those kidnap and the terrible impackt on their families but we do have responsibility to take reasonable steps to stop issues esclating and to avoid any further increase in communiy attention stopped the escalation prevent the community attention that is the important thing well yesterday the metropolitan police reportedly arrested a man for posting a vidio criticising people for putting up palisinian flags around his neighborhood here is the viio n les is the kangish ais ono ano on palsing in fa coson flagwas ar all around his neighborhoood en o o he n an o oonaliterally every flag on palcoonlabea e a this guy was then arrested here is the vidio of his arrest well that e o yo o tha an e en o o o ton resi o o i i tn tii ti fi aoy tetter we o thirol you thou es the thing to a a teoer ta re an aeso a

teo e oei ii o oa o wha they arrested him for saying why are these people in our country meaning people who are posing palisinian flags in the middle of giant ralies for comas now the police did not remove the palicinian flags for the sake of community tention in the current moment those flags are clearly meant to support coms after all there were no ralies with palicinian flags prior to october seventh happening tin great britain if there are true separation in cause between thse called pro palicinian protestors we see on the streets and the procomas protestors one might imagine that propalistinian protestors would call for cmses ouster and surrender says to make way for a peace process not one moment of that has materialized none at all zeros obzilt but the british policean touch the flags in the name of relieving community tension or anything instead they arrested the man who wondered why britan would import the kinds of people would post paliscinian flags on street poles welcomas is holding human babies hostage remember the tensions must be reduced now there are two ways to roduce tension in a ommunity the first is to cave to those who are the most ratical and the most dangerous in this case the oma supporters criminalize anyone would ask just why a community in the wess should be expected to contain people who support comas take them to jail for asking that question ontape the second way to lower ommunity tensions is to recognize that those very people who defend komas are a danger to yor community that the problem is not community quiescencs but the constituency of the community itself that there cannot be community with people who root for comas this should be obvious but it is not it is not because less simply refuses to look reality in the face better to arrest people who speak that reality than to look reality in the face because reality is ugly and reality is un pleasant and reality might require you to recognize that the importation of milions of people who hate the west was an awful terrible itdea and that means should be taken to reverse that process and instad away has to be found to pretend taway the threat plam it on israel jabber about the two state solution talk about is lamaphobia whatever you do to not look the realities of multi culturalisms dramatic failure directly inthe face do not do it this of course place to rectly into the hands of comas they know understand that they can say in to literally anything and that much of the west will cover for them in order to maintain the fiction that multie culturalism works there in bother to hide the ball they know that you are stupid and or week the will say it to rectly out to your face they understand they you will just pretend they didn say it they youill pretend to misunderstand them they you will in fact grant credibility to people who cheer for them in the streets here is comas official tgosi comad speaking just one we could go on lebonies to the calling for a tacts on jewish civilians until israel is extrapacees will repeat otober seventh over and over and over eso you t te tou o sas israel is a country that has no place on our landwe must re

they tell you that they want to do it again and again and again operation all oxo flood is the name of what they did that is literally the name of what they did andthere saying they want do it over and over and over again and by the way there are polls showing that there is wide and broad support for this in muslin countries across the world pretending that you can import a bunch of peoplepw'll gree with commass and this is not somehow one to have some on back on your community is simply insane it is totally crazy in every available wats toltally totally nuts for example there is a recent pole showing one in three in lebanon currently favor war with israel the pull found broad support for commoss terror organizate that the commoss ter operation o called operation all oxa flood of the four hundred individuals pole in lebanon eighty per cent supported what commostid eighty per cent in lebanon eighty per cent and by the way if youlok an other countries very similar numbers the group wishing to condemn israel's comprise of it ninety seven per cent of share respondence eighty four percent of sonyu respondence fifty five per cent of christian lebony's respondence in seventy five per cent of drews respondence and just one second we will get to more of commostras saying it all out loud because they know that you will not look hom in the face they know it they know that you will just ignore what they did on otober seventh they will ignore what they say they are going to do in the future including kill you and you children you will ignore it ecause un comfortable better than if somebody says it we arrest thatke we have to a rest that key for the sake of community piece wel get to that momentarily first pure talk recently announce they would alleviate ten million dollars

about israel and what israel is doing to the the horr of tha the horrible crimes theyre committing against talstinean civilians the literal governing power is saying they have no interest in protecting their civilians and in fact thand want their own civilians to die here is again a member of commass explaining abumarzuk saying this baty at the t wrepors as many people are asking amsinc youve built five hundred colometers of tunnels mthat why have you bil bomshaltos we wercivilains can hide during bombardmens says we have built the tunnels because we have no other way of protecting ourselves frm eintargeted and killes on te thin these tunnels are men to protect us from the airplans owe are fighting from inside the tunnels everybody knows that seventy five per cent of the people in the goses for ar efugese com somtin and it is the responsibility of th united nations to protect them according to the geneva conventions it is the responsibility of the occupation tito provide them with all services as long as the are under occupation they say it all out loud on camera over and over and over again they do not stop saying it they shouted from the roof tops but the west will not look commass in the face because i it did it might have to look commasis supporters in the face and whellcomases an gaza commas supporters are everywhere workin our schoorers they go to our schools they staff our press and are academic institutions that is too ugly and it is too frightening we have to look away an the name of relieving community tention of course this is how the west dies by looking away by refusing to acknowledge reality all that community tention they are two ways they can go ways i said one is the u silens everybody in the name of the wy and the other is that you maybe look at the forces that are tearing away at the community mon to the ladter and we will end up doing the former and again the the peoplewho are standing for n the people har actively rooting for comas i do not ohas to say the members the me ar tuince they are they are rooting for israel to lose to a terrers groupem thet the heads at tiy workers and and ten calls dads i explain how amazing it is what theyre doing it is it is all over the world i meahere is a top yon official yesterday thes top youan official hit is get in prag molkaber he redined from the uen and he told se an end who is asked tid coms a te genicide he refuses to answer the question ecause of course if he answers the question you might notice it his can refuse to answer the question aw do you arrive at the assessment based on you and convantion a definition of ganiside that israel is carrying out at ganiside right now w a right thats based upon a ou an convention the binding international legal treaty that defines what genic ideas what its elements are and we know that genicide is a term that is often politicised its often missins its offen use tisis te charge of abuse by one side or the other chilling on a large scale a expulsions creating conditions on that ir determined to bring about a affectively the destruction of a population this case the population in gassa all of these have been very well documented and add up to a crime of geniside israel continues to say it is going after hamass is hamass that is keeping ats civilions where it is it is using them innocent palitonan as human shields why label that genicide of course we senes what tot we semis claims before a repeatedy by the as raily authorities in previous at lard scale attacks on civilian populations first claiming self defense under international law gives no state the right to commit the kinds vatrocities that it is carrying out now hegen has never com asses fault is never comemosses fault there jus cin obscur ite ther're just going to say that israel is afault because again if you notice that one of these groups come os is an actual evil genicinal duhating organization af the say it out loud and they brag about using human shields wel then mi change your opinion a word word were not alowed to change our opanians on these things because that might have some consequences for the rest of the west and the entire alloed has come round this here is a former buningstandrers spoke's person whil lede shaghi itsplaining this is israel's fault of course of course we have a government in an israet in a parter in israel that has never empowered the palistinan leadership in the west bank to actually reach a settlement the final sat is settle settlement about what to do with the two states olution we ac cave a ar right is raelly government that opposes palistin in state of very openly and you the united states must use its diplomatic and financtial everit with our alli the ally we fund militarily to to put prestsure on them to in power the secular authoritities in the west bank who have been the leadership of the palistinian people but have never been inpower to actually be at the thing table in negotiate in recent years with these railies o israels are for are not impowing palistinians to make peace by by what duposing the palcing an authority an putting in place a moderate palisonian which you wouthen complain about as an act of apartide and genicide an all the rest of it it is ridiculous but this is huge segments of our media it is huge segments of academia and its huge segments of

on the side of com a ma i do not know how ise to put it they want israel to loose over the last couple of days isrel had to hit a target and gur balya which is a quonquot refuge cap bi alway say qonquo because people do not understand ar refuty camp is they think that a refuge camp in the iddle east books how you would con siderat lik much of fema trailers by a river somewhere tht just flooded that is not what is happening in the gozestript its are full scale cities that have been there for fifty years with giant buildings they are called by the international comuitiy refuge camps to maintain the false claim that people living in gibalya somehow of a right to live in heipho which is absolute shur nonsense it is ridiculous there as never been a situation in human history where a country a sovereign country is forced to open its own borders two people far outside those bordersthat it is not a thing that happens in international law ever seriously name o time this as ever happened in human history does not work that way a but put that aside the idea that israel hits this this target inside the gerbalya refuge camp it is a military target how doyou knote to military tary becuse the ground underneath it collapses you knw it does not tend tend to happen very often if if you hit a building from above and here is nothing underneath it you do not ten get a giant sink hole why there is a gian sinkle tbecause secondary explosions and because tunnels underneath it collapsed and a bunch of commass nex bunch of come oss members were killed because they were underneath ter including top commanders and coss thrust of the world saw pictures though of a boom a boom went there 's a big boom and people were killed in the big boom it does not matter thet israel has distributed at this poin tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of leef lets above gaza telling people get the hell out of the areal where you are itsto military aria and when n'n haf to hit it come oss told people to stay in cluding many young men it told them to stay they con be used this human shiels that is the intire point and the mediat immediately rush they were eager they are eager they would set up the in har preticat for this i've en tolg about this for weeks at this point tht they were setting up the preticut for when israel did what it had to do claiming that israel is now the offending party the predicet was it malti prongs s oll one thing they would says tos take what we have to warn its tru if to warn them to yu to you we we jobine wa sanges we need to warn israel theyive to be very careful abouts villian lefts who have warned them to be veryisrael is more careful about civillion lives than the united states and of story is reall sacrifice far more of its lives proportionally of its soldiers in ordiga house to house than the united states did in places a rock or of gannistan which is why their hundreds of thousands of dead civilians in a rock an af ganistan a but put that asde the idea really really does it but does not matter point number one propaganistic point of one is if it warnt for of the west tugging on israels cotels telling them not to murder of the children tan they would be in there just opening heads and and bashing children in the head really nilly now again that is the non sensical isral hads complete airo superiority there is no air force for commas thank god if israel one to vicerate the intire arean kill two million people it has the power to do that it is not doing that tbecaue tht would be terrible and a moral an is ralsing an to do that part one of the ly was we have to tell his ral not's violate humn ritescs if we do not tell them than they certainly will and then part two wies well it might be just proportionate if israel had to military target an tere're some civilions there that might be just that is not with this proportion it means this proportionat does not mean tht israel some house to measure the proportion betwen the number of is rally dead and the umber of gosin dead that isnot how that works if that woure way that worked then the allies we are morally wrong and worldwar tubes way more germansdied than britstide in world wor to what proportionality means is is the end saut proportional to the means taken you are the giant commoss head quarters and it is underneath the civilion area is a proportionate to hit that when theyare literally aiming rockets you from that area and the answer is clearly us but the me yoa pretend ther o ano the stuff now either ther unbelievably ignorant of the rules of ware the laws warn how our works or they re liars there are note there there is no thir choice there i ther ignorant or they are liars i think their liars i thing a lot of them are liars i think they certainly no better and they are avoiding the knowing better because to do might offend it might offend you do not want o offend it all the radicals out there whofl agree with commas and you have to pretend to moral equivalents cas that moral equivalence is you are warm baff man it is look warm and it is really dirty butt it is a warm bath whereas if youhave to take a side might be left out in the cold by somebody that isto the medea's responds to the gobolyabomming in just one second but first the october fifteenththat tax dead line has just

network you ssay dot com slashed chipiro to day again tax network you ssay dot com slash chipiro ar it heres how the media responded to the bommbing of a hommas military target ingurbalya that israel warn people repeatedly to get out of the way of in bremmer who is ben on the show i in nice guy he is unbelievably wrong areman attribut this ignorance because again i think he ins a nice person but i do not understand wat the hellys talking bet the the blast hits jubot he treats out this is a war crime period yknow the war crime is when you hide you'r military targets underneath civilians that is an actual war crime under the geneva conmentions a target is transformed into a military target when it is military and you hide it beneath the civilianaria you cannot protect yourself thatway in fact if yot were the contrary every military on earthwould hide beneath civilians men imagine the logicyure it is absolutly insane the logic its being used here is that if commos we are to go and murder bunch of is rally civilians and then go on to a field some whore than israel can go wellin nally holhog on them but if they commit the double atrocity of murdering a munch was railly civilians andthen hiding but beneat their own civilians now they'r amun now there ae eun the magicalleamiun what do you think that incentivizes that incentivize is every oneg to hide behind ciilians if the way you gain defensive immunity is by hiding behind women and children then every single terrise is going to hide behind women and children which is precisely the reverse of the called laws of war the intire r purpose of the laws of war for those who are not complete faring moreons is to get military members in military uniform away from civilians if you generates and intirer inens of structure that tells people to get out of uniform and among civilians what do you think you are doling you are incentivizing that behavior of course members ofthe media agan i have to assume tha they are not complete moreons but maybe they are you are not a good situation when the catch twenty to the the the better moral solution is that the members of the media are far stupid that they do not understand the stuff as oppose to they are unbelievably a moral and evil an here is the yor times nicholas cristov who is been garbage on this as well joining joy read whois a probably comfortablwith many antisemmies on emisenbisy and his take is the real prome heres that israel's bomming is radicalizing people you kow they will not radicalize before over there in gozlstand now under under the tootalage of commass they warn't radicalize ytheyre a bunch of nice western people but now israel bombing them that is what is really radicalizing them ofw ga thank you for that magicawll catch twenty two you have now created either israel gets to defend itself in it citizens by you kow killing the people who are aming rockets at it and keeping two undred thirty three people under ground and also jis murdered fifteen hundred of their citizens or if they if the or they can presumably just wait to die they can wait to die as not tooffend here is necholas cristov urging solution too wait to die soas not to offend people youwould not want people who hate israel tho hate be isral even more yeu you certainly oudn't want that thou be bad youwill not want a radicalize heradical population radical they elect te commoss justhere i bunderguar your exconction owar and not know your cure next i has been in ot completely staggering i think it that it is also i radical ies the west bank one of the things that i worrid thout is that there will be masta restion west bank as sat people in all people are talking about is what is happening in cossat and and there is also a wide streat conviction among people in the west bank that the i explosion at the hospital we go on it tet that was not onmy cos by israel bet it tact which u do te grat strike on a hospital by israel oint tat at my best guest tis tot do is probably a i someecehod rocket they wet astray but it that is not the perception in the west bank by well that is not e perception west bank soming even they'l never forgive is ral for not hetting that hospital because hat would have provided them with their favorite talking point obviously i love that sr nicholas crstopumen ands that segnon by bang the're being radicalized by things isral did not even do is os hould stopp doing the things that is doing and also s isro should definitely stop dong the things it is not doing which things is israel alowed to do then they cannot do the things that they are doing an they cannot do the things that they are not doing ut again all that is his excuse making it is excuse making you just people seem to not mind very much when jews just absorbed death that is when you i have seen many tweets over the last several weeks going although the world opinion is turning against the jews now it is really turng in if they if they retaliate the world opinion turns against the jews guess what if i've a choice between breathing and defending myself i am going to keep breathing i'm addicted to it a'm not can stop doing it for your viewing pleasure i'm not going to commit suicide in orders thy you feel better about yourself it is absurd bthere is wof flitz are doing the same disgusting routine on siannand they seenour ha lost official that a claims was the leader in the october seven terroris atack agans ficial we do not yet do howee civilians we are killed it that a strike ot that refugy cap but tha is takin ot what a lost leader or maybe two ar lost leaders who may have been there worth the deth of som very civilian wha the port a israels effort to defend itself it has not us the right to defen itself or te responsibility a tord it citizons in it sovereignty in the face of a rutal horific attack that took place on october seven and for the good of israel for the good of the reason for the good of america the free world and for the good of the palathinian people in gosa a we meed to make sure that hamas is defeated that that is the right ans wr my ha can jefferes but will not blits are doing the yohat theythey took out two moss manners can tnat justify is let me be clear israel right now by doing this they know that there are hossages down there they know that there are hossages down there goodn this immediately come oss by surrendering any one calling for comssus to surrender no one in th mediateis calling for comassu urrender none of them the same people hoar weeping crocodile tears over the situation and goza refuse to actually engage in the one conversation thy ould actually force comoss to surrender which is come oss you have two choices you caneither be completely destroyed or wecan surrender i swear if if these members the media hand been completely dominant during the world wor to there is no way that the allige coul hav wan the war not one way in hell the alige ould wan the war every act the alliges took wu an second gest everything that te allies did notor to win that war whul ive entreates to human rice violation and the german certainly out ave wone this is the media are disgusting i men truly gross and meanwhile this of course is translating into some public opinion ou some of this public opinion is being at manufactured tere is a liberal group a progressive policy and pulling organization called data for progress and they ask the following question to americans quote the u s should call for sease firer and de escollation of violence and goza the us should leverage is close diplomatic relationship with israel to prevent further violence and civilian deaths agree or disagree i'll get whele i mean if your gan a stacket that way i agree r amun i if the idea wit o of desease fire is that the sease fire will stop all death civilian violent lall and but of course that is not the case we know that if there is sease fire commoss wil grow stronger and the commoss will do this again and tat comosswill put its own civilians in the line ofire again but whn you phrase it that way which is the medias entire phraseology you remove all the contect and just say bad things are happening would you the bad things to stop ye no much bad things but what sometimes got to do the bad thing to prevent the worst thing especially when the group already did the worst thing and they have pledged that they are going to do the worst thing again and again and again and again until there are no jus left but the media have to do that they have to do that because again that allows them to live their favorite lie and that favorite lie is that in our magical multite cultural epcot sent for world we are all the same the only thing that truly divides us is whether we cumus or whethr we crepts that is the only thing that really divides us whether we burshed or whether we philopho otherwise we are all the same we think the same things we can import hundreds of thousands of you into western cultural centere s while you scream for our deaths and there thre is a vidio thot se going around thotse somewhat telling in terms of the cultural differentiation between certain ares of the world and other aireas of the world and it showed the status of women in a variety of muslin countries before the take over by radical muslims an showed vidio of what aranian women dress for example before or the shafell the're dress western women and look at them to day and theyare all stuffed into berkas take a look at women in afgannistan the nineteen fifties when the united states had a heavy presence in afgannisan here dress western women to day they are stuffed into berkas pretending this cultural difference does not exist is insanity it suicidal insanity pretending that you can import one set of values into an completely different set of values that is no impack what soever andthen maintaining that lie at the cost of the free speech of your own citizens is toullly grazy but that is exactly what everybody has been engaging tand predictably predictably this is generating a new way of antisemetism of course because why would not it becauseyou are making effectively two seproclams one is then you'r blind to the antisemitism of raticalislum it does not exist the're just you totally normal for the sake of community piece we have to let them do what the're gon to do and we have to take down the stuff that offends them because they are just us that is lie number one and ly number to is becauseyou have tenormalis comasin it supporters ou have to pretend hanactually israel brought the supon itself an if israel brought thespondece up that mens israels the badguy and if israels the badgoy than every who supports israel is the bad guy you knows sportisrael the jews that is that is why antisemetism has fiht you cannot dis connect with the media are doing in terms of they are assault and lies about the current conflict from the spike and antisematism the media campelf lament the

fillup about civilian dath in gaza and she asked what i believe to be in ancriible dum question the dum question is is theral limits to the number of civilians dying in a conflict beyond which you are just n ot allowed to go when of course the answer to this is no the answers this is is there is not in actual numerical limit the reason thre's not an actual numerical limit that we have rules of war riht those rules of war that ou supposed to minimi civilian casualties but you cannot have a sliding the scale in terms of human life where if you kill ten thousand civilians that is al caybutif you will ten thousand and one civilians well then we really have to tell it t call of the duck the reason you cannot have that particularly in this contact is because if you articulate such a limit what do you think comosseis it insense of structure is comossin sense of structure is then to kill ten thousand and one civilians to put civilians all over the dan place if you say to themlisson we will kill eight thousand of your civilians but if we go any further hn that e ralygan have to stop whose interest is it in for these civilians to die at that point the party trying to stop is ro from take our comosce omss that is what graham is saying ragury u'l ou crabt for be sorely right on us is there a threshholt for you and they think there should be what for the united states cofermat atd which think you ast wult say let let us hold our fir sacon a terms ot civilian cataa theyre as therare pi at well wo it start to cuastceal irif somebody ask us after war to ter limit what you would do to mak sure the japan and germany do not conquer the world is there any limit what is wor should do to the people for trying to slaughter the jus thansers no there is no limit but here is what you na do be smart less try te limits of theing cashal leas best wo can les put ou manatarin a an er is the for teck thenisthant om all for that to graham is saying exactly the right thing which is whi should try tominimy svilling casualties by nocin put in number on this peeks that only benefits commass and meanwhile i'll be felbus is there doing the well i' m ean that there are a lot of people it is amazing again ignorant wore terrible those are the only two choices all this they say is fomenting antisemis is ean onsurprisingly we are seeing a radical increasing antisemetism which is kind of an amazing thing it really is we what we are watching right now is the worst attack on juws since the holicost and in the wake of that more attack is on jews now in the west i cannot imagine many other groups to which the supplies let us say tat the are white to promised t ottack on a black church if the immediate response fom everybody wod be white to premisis are awful people who sympathize with them are awful and we have no tolerance for people committing what he federal govern would call hate crimes against black people first palt you on' you ned a shooting for that on nead is a viral vidio for that but when it comes to the jews oddly enough a bunch of jews get killed an th rest of the world's seems it is the jews fault and we should probably harm them maybe that is because the media ar driving a narrative that i's the jew's fault and maybe to cate a harm them that is what happens when you when you actively mobilize in favor of a group that seeks to harm jews accomplishes that and then claims im unity un surpriseingly ank smetic incidents across the glove of spikt according to th jerusalem post a shocking sorgenantismetic incidents including an astonishing one thousand one hund eighty per cents increase in antismitic discourse has swept ocross the globe during the on going swords of iron war according to a comprehensive report released by israel's national institutions and government the reports a joint effort of the diaspera affairs in combating anti semitisof the ministry the worldsinest organisation and the jewish agiency the report thetailes an alarming almost twelvefold increase in antismtic discourse tan includes calls for violence against israel's inis and jews almost all of it is in arabic seventy one per cent in english twenty eight per sent one in three of the antismatic events are inthe united states thre's been a three udred thirty per cent in creae in violent antismetic incidents seventy one per cent originated from arab and his lomic groups are mone not a gian shock in any of those statistics an cris ray the had of the atbea he saying the same he says camasses successes gain cause violencere at home sence the herrific terris attacs committed by hamas against innocent people in israel a few weeks ago wee been working arou the clack to support our partners there and to protect americans here at home weasas that the actions of hamas and its allies will serve as an anspiration the of which we have not seen sinc i shous launchd it called califate several years ago in just the past few weeks multiple fareign territoranizations have called for attack against americans and the west i mean he is reght about that of course but you knon t sam a factor that is cuttigvery much in favor of that is when the entireur wan isee media rush to the defense of comass and you are if you are calling on israel to stop the killing of commoss terrase re now i it that benefits other than comass it is literally their goal here is the obe i director saying that anti semitism is reaching record levels well yah obviously i will say athat this is a threat that is a reaching in some way sort of historic levels a in part because as all too well the jewish community a is targeted by terris really across the spectrm hom gronvan extremeis fareign terris organizations both suny and she a domestic fa extremeis and in fact ar statistics would indicate that for a group that represents only about to point four per cent of the american public they account for something sixty per cent of all religious pace hate crimes one mean i wonder by that would be mean it could not be anything systemic could it at all heu re out e stemac races mon could be anything about the systemic antisematism of media that constantly finds excuses to blame open hatred of jews and in fact murder of jews on other causes meanwhile at our universities things continued be finding games of prokmas mab was bullying an jewish stude at harvard s here is that looked heu can see here there is jewish student the prokomas mab surrounds the jewish te ister at ot pushing him around i o ma suffice it to say that if this were a bunch of which you premisis tudent surrounding blackstone in doing this this woul be the fron page story in every major newspaper for a year entire democratic party would run on this ostemic rasism of the american people this is happening this kind ofst off is happening dozands of time to day across the united states ran now on major university campasses and tum i guess thits justuft that happens man i gess that is just ats just tha way that it goes meanwhile over in france thinks are going even better a french women had her house spray painted with jewish stars which is not if ocative at all the holocoss or anything you o i as again is in all going to s the hatred i saw as a child o and i do not understand ou seen the background her house has been spray painted with a stars of david now again one of the reasons for the wild growth of the antisematism is also because its being spurred by social medeo s a tik tok which is a garbage outlet that ought to be band tik tock the views of pro palestine posts our far out weighing the views of pro israel posts according to axios if you look at the the period october sixteenth through twenty three you see that the're kind of even hashshak stand wth palestine hashak tan with israel kind of even in terms of the number of views and then if you fast ford one week tiktock schanges changes their algrethm obviously and the stand with palestine hashakis now getting two hundred eighty five million views compared with sixty four million for stand with israel wo belyv there been two hundred ten thousand posts using the hashak stand with palestine in seventeen thous in using the hashak stand with israel since october sixteen tiktock is is not just the procyou for understanding how many muslims are around the worlds were using it it is also because agan tiktok is own by the goverment f china andthe govermentof china has been actively oriented in a comases favor meanwhile russia is orienting in a homases favor as well thas has been true for literally years as the moscow times reports in thecase of a comas moscows long posiet up to thegroup declining to designate it as a terrorst organization even after the october som of the tack and making clear is loathe to sever contact with comas in doing russia provides comoss of the terras most covit legitimating effect of recognition in wo thousand seven putent hosted homas is then leader colled mashaw in moscow and received praise from ashow for his courage and manliness ween was thanked again by comas after the octobersome of the tax this time for his quot position regarding the onjoing's inist segression against our people yet there lot of reasons that anti sematism is is rising pretty dramatically ardigize the rest of the show is continuing right now ill be jumbing into the mail bag if you not a meer

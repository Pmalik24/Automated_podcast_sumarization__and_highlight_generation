jobidons h legal immigration crisis is real and it is really relly growing take a look at this graphic from the new york times website is from to day tabout border in counters in twenty twenty three this is absolutly stunning hour go through it in detail because it defintely shows just how open jobidon has left the border woon twenty twenty three againd this according to ou s customs and border protection there were three point one million attempted border crossings at th u s southern border in twenty twenty threes the question becomes one what is driving that and two how many of thes people got in and it is question to then ansers question one if lots of people are strung up the border and lots weopl oar getting in that of course is going to drive more people to the borders yet three point one in people showing up again at the southern border and here is how this breaksdown six hundred thousand of those people entered undetected that is an estimate a by c b p those would be the known godaways now thre's a whole category yere that is not even on the chart those wo be the unknown godaways who we onreally have an idea of how many unknown godaways there are the way the we know the known godaways is because there is camera coverage of large suathes of the american border but we do not always have bore patrol agents where sitting on every single camera all the time the way that it works that you have these border cameras an there loaded on to essentially giant pylons and there re four of them pointsed in all directions but if you have one border patrol agent whose in charge of twenty cameras thre con be some people he does not see when they rush intwo the country goes for bathom break and suddenly that is when sommady comes through that according to people i know atcustoms and borde protection what you are really looking at is probably another four hundred thousand people who have entered undetected minnimums you toing about a million people who have entered on detectives in twenty twenty three alone ka now that still leaves twopoint five million people who had in counters with you hase customs in borde protection out the way we ten to think of that and this is why a lot of this is weasel words when you think em in counters by u s customs and bord protection what you think of is a bore patrol agents stumbles upon legal imigrant and tells thm to go home wrong that never happens almost ever a now used to hapen a lot more under title forty two title forty two whas a provision of federal law that suggested that if you were fearful that people are entering the country with disease you could simply turn them back at the border and that was used for several years in the afteromat of cove nineten but it did end even in twenty twenty three there are five hundred sixty five thousand people were expelled under title forty two five hundred sixty five thousand people those effectively speaking were the only people who were expelled yet about a hundred eghty thousand people ere voluntary departures and a hundred eight five thousand people were expedited removals those who be people who had criminal backgrounds for example the total number of people out three pen one million who received th deepportation orr or who were expelled eiht hudred seventy thousand but remember titl forty two has now gone away that means five hundred sixty thousand people this year in twenty twenty four if these numbers wore to remain stedy would now enter the united states that mean that aside from title forty two which again was only in a it was only in application temporarily under title forty two five hundred six five thousand people are turned away all those people would now enter which means a grand total of three hndred sixty five thousand people who are actually removed or departed voluntarilly tbecause for example they realized that they are going to be dinged on a cronal background tract now we get to the people who ere added to the docket and what happened to the rest of them of the people whoare process under titally those one point nine million people only three hundred and sixty five thousand of those people were actually removed every other person entered the united states all of them that means that youre talking about just from this chart alone two point for million people in twenty twenty three who entered the united states the vast majority of those people are here illegally they do not have asylum protected status refug status that refug or asylum status has to be proved in a quart of law but those people have not prove to anything in a qort of wai tinstead they have come to the border they claim that they are in fact asilees from their home countries that they are our people who cannot go back because if they go back tho wll be killed or they will be persecuted or whatever and then because we are not processing them and because me do process that oure standards are two low we are allowing everybody into the country even a courting to this new york times chart you had a minimum of two point for million people who crossed the southern border in twenty twenty three now understand by way of contrast that during the intiraty of the trump ad ministration the number of border in counters during the entirity of the trump ministration was one point sex million you had two point for million people enter lasture alone under jobidon that is it meinsane number an none thse people gone away one people are brought into the united states in there given adate shop later tvast majority of them never gan a show up later because why would thy possibly show up they ben integrated into american society they are receiving whatever benefits they can receive there in california actually real state benefits may be up to an including helf care why exactly they show for court date where they made very well be deported if they cannot prove that they have a real asylum claim instead they just stay that is what jobiton has done and he has done that because there were executive orders in place under donal trump that prevented a lot of this not only title forty two but most prominently remin in mexico remain in meico said that if you showed up the border and you said i fear to go back to my home country the trump ad ministrations hat okie wait mexico will figur it out if the processu bouneatowait in mexico which means you are not going to be releastin to the interior because there is good shot the you actually would have to show up for your quaurt cases and then you would be rejected and in the meantime heu cantues disappear in chicago or new york or lanto or denver or whatever but tobident got rid of that they one that was on of the very first things that he did was get rid of remain in mexico that is the reason you are seeing this vast extraordinary increas and you legal imigration aftuus southern border it is amazing the inpact of all of this is absolutely insane what is that impackt well for example many illegal migrans are now arriving on the eastcoast to new york that they are being stored on football fields n whe there is bad weather they have to be moved

presumably directly into the school bildings and this is what school bildings are for now you'r public resources being used to housey legal emigrans from foreign countries while kids ore told they'fe to stay hom from school and lorn remote as though we are still in themidle of coved or as those schools should have ever been closed during covin according to the your post judens at brooklan high

records and backgrounds we do not even know one mom went off on the migrants they pulled upsankuot how does it how you feelds you does not feel good how de ia fel o kicked all the kids out of school to marrw to feell good hope if feell good i hope you sleep well to nigy a local dabtset how d o you have feeld stealing american tax pairbudy and i got tolet to certain exstent ion't blame the legal emigrns i blame the authorities why the hellor the authorities not turning these people away if you were somebody whois coming from ta equador which is a disaster of a country and you are trying to go to a better place you alsoid want to come to the united states but it is the responsibility of te american governmens to pratack america's bordr rs a country without borders is obviously not a country what is in credible to me is how the left has completely forgotten about this it is totally insane in two thousan fifteen here is burny standers making the case that we should not have open borders hoping waters ornit ta wants us that is the culp of this proposal the inle corse i me that is the rite wing proposal which says te centurally there isnon yan i it is lep but if anybody the wouldn make yo lo o bo a por riter wouldnt it din bake everybody in america porting doing away with with the conslep of an ation tite n i do not thing is any country on the worl which believes in that no one believes that except for apparently large slaws of the democratic party how is border patral antasto borer patrol has been told their first priority is that one some one claims asylum you mus as a border patrol agent make direct for them beeline directly for them now recently went down to the border wer can ave a ton of material on this that is coming out en let me tell you the situationof the border is a full scale disaster area border patrol agents are being told not to actually police the border they are ssentially acting as a fairy service four elegal emigrans which is why you now have the amazing spectacle of you legal omigran's crossing the border and then sitting around and complaining hat the border patrol is not showing up fast enough you would complain if you share up in hotel and the bellman did not showe fast enough here is sianand highlettin you legals from tran a complaining about having to wait in the cold they rush towards us o i ui mike not even on but that does not stop this crowd of chinese migrants from venti produce r yong shong they are angry having to wait in the cold for border patri i oo oa on o as who were all sick we have been you three days now three makeshift border camps we stop at in eastern sandiago county alongside micens from latin america at each camp we doesns from china i've a question why would you possibly legally imigratua country and believe that it is the responsibility of border patrol to howsand worm you why in the anser obviouslys because the by dministration is made clear that this is what they are going to do and by the way these illegal in rens are not wrong thebidin administration has in fact made clear to border patrol agents that their chief function now ninety per ent of border patrol agents have been staffe on essentially bussing and administrative duties at the border there is an actual sign in certain parts ofthe border where you push a button for border patrol help i'm not getting that is a real thiing again we n have a tuna material it is coming out about this because it really is stunning what is happening at our southern border but the fact that jo bidon has open theborder white is clear to literally every one now what is amazing is that democrat's continue to claim that that jobidoneis on top of this thing jobinin on top of anything jobdin can barely get into a walk in shower at this point here is senator criscoons trying to pretend that it is the un precedented border crisis thet's motivating bidin to adrest the border crisis that of course duntrue if jobidn one intenter and the border crisis tomorrow he can probably do wit th couple of his decule borders he is not doing any of that there has to be tromatic action in stopping the flow of illegal em igrad intof this country yes and joe a that voew broagly is shared that wemead and emigration system a that is safe that is suman and that is legal and the numbers of folks who are presenting at the southern borders seeking asylum has motivated our president a both in his first state of the union a to call on congress to legislatively address this and givin the powers he needs and in the supplemental package he has for months ago t as for billions of dollars to strengthen boarders security we disagreed but tween repoplicans and democrats about what colicies we will most likely acheeved that outcome but there is a broad awareness that the huge numbers of folks who are transiting central america and coming through mexico to our southern borders just not sustainable gat then why do not you stop it and the answer is what democrats want is they want more money for ad ministrative functions s just told you border patral ninety per cent staffed on administrative functions they want more money for ad ministrative functions they want to be able to brod in the ability oby legal imigrans to enter the country they do not want the border police to better and again the drug crat tells control the borders thail us shold be clear about this this is not individual illegal imigrants whare crossing thousands of miles by themselves through the snows through the they are paying coyotes they are paying mexican drug cartells in order to get into america the industry here is enormous as heye mention yesterday the mexican drug car tells are making thirteen billion dollars a year just on trafficang human beings a cross america southern border the cartells or tit they speck out were on the border people should cross they know exactly where to drop people off they they learo drive up to up to the border in trocks literally they just drive up to the southern border in trocks his maxco soveren country subor patral does not have the abilityes simply cross the border and do anything they drive up in trocks moaded with hundredsof eleglimigrants and then jus drop them there that is the cartells and they are making money off tit and yet these democrats are trying to facilitate all of that egets more on

members the abominadministration this is crazy j johnson who is the former d chasecretary under braguama he has said this is crazy steven rattiner who served as councillor to the treasury secretary under the obama administration he has a pece over the near times to day talking about the situation at our southern boarder he says democrats want more money to process the bakua republicans want substantially narrow the grounds how much migrans would be permitted to remain in the united states we need lots of the former and a bit of the ladter ah no actual weu need a lot of the ladder and not nearly as much of the former he suggests that the democrats push fom oure funding is correct the country's immediate need is to un clog the emigration court system know that is not the immediate need the immediate need is to close the border and then figure out what the hell to do with the people here the probem is te unclag the court system that is going to facilitate more illegal entry if you unclog the system all that means is prosting more people at the border now he saying that means that ofll get to more court cases faster yat but ice is not te porting anybody peovle on show up for the court cases ice is not going to go into their houses and then pick them up and throw them out that is not something tha yobinan has tast ice with doing saying tha we need more administrate of law judges whe're going to adjudicate whether some one has a true asylum claim or not unless theyare going to do that within seventy two hours it are not gon a happen an need e lay where people are released into te country is going to result and those people remaining in the country he says we must reduce the float to the border which will require making emigrating into the us by such means more difficult even rattiner sas as re publicans have long demanded and democrates are coming to see as necessary our obligation under international lot to provide asylum need not create chaos for starters we shuld require asylum secres tal play in mexico or other countryes rit is the remain a mexical policy that trump at tempted to do and then bidin basically killed also says ratener we ned to tighten he asylum criteria for example we shuld make a greater distinction in the asylum process between those who followed o stablished procedures and enter the country throug n establish pourt ofventry and those who crossed along our border but tree between ports fventry wheile no actualy what you need to do is tighten up what it means to be a pursin who should receive asylum which rattener admits e says while recognizing the need for due process we should raise the legal standard for consideration for asylum from a significant possibility that asylum would be granted to something closer to the standard used for final decisions in emigration court we also weu need to further limit use of humanitarian paroll a prom them expanded by the bi dministration that allows more migrants from placeliyke ven is uayla an nicadagua to temporarily enter the country and apply for relief as heartbreaking is maybe we simply cannot take every refugy from every failed state caye all of that is true and where all f that stuffis that s allan atrurto that is exactly the bill l the democrats are currently rejecting all of its an nah ar two democrats are cunently rejecting it which means this is an idealogical thing an jobidon could simply ree in state the policies that donal trump had in place and the border flow would stop it would stop we did not have anything remotely this flow at the border under donaltrum it did not exist in anything remotely these numbers there is only one reason for that the only reason for that is now clima changin in is not discontent south of the border it is simply because jobidneis an open borders preseden in every single person knows it and is issue is going to bike jobidn directly in the rear as it properly ought to and meanwhil more bad news for the bignan ministration with regard to the economy accoring to acios the global economy of the twenty twenties will be more bleak than the decade that proceeded it with sluggish economic activity less

continues we have now learned that loid austen he secretary of defens was diag notes with prostaye cancer and did not tell the president for literally weeks according to politico doctors on tuesday discloses the reason the fen secretry loid oston as hospitalized on ganuary first was due to complications from a late december surgery to treat prostay cancer answering a major quostion involving the pensagon ches mysterious heltstituation but raising further issues with how the episode was handled this was announced yesterday by the pensagon press secretary major general patrock riderys as the defen secretary's treated for prostay canser now we ware told his an elective surgery an elective surgery does not mean an unnecessary surgeries lik an notesjob it just means the can elect the time to do it is not an emergency surger but it seems if the secretary defenc as a surgery for prostay cansers rytllat somebody know here is the pensagon prosecretary announcing this this is a statement from doctor john matics troma medical director and doctor gregory chestnut to center for prostate disease recearch of the mirth the center director at walter read national military medical center in pathesta marylan a beginning od the statement as part of secretary austens routinely recommended health screeming he has undergone regular prostate specific antigen p sa surveillance changes in his laboratory evaluation and early december twenty twenty three identified prostate cancer which required treatment on december twenty second twenty twenty three after consultation with his medical team he was admitted to walter read national military medical center and underwent a minimalyinvasive surgical procedure called t a prostut ec to me to treat and cure prostate cancer an then he says that austen has taken responsibility for transparence issues while i'm glad i'm glad that what good good for you the go missing f a full week and nobody knows including your number too and yofve taken responsibility no usually responsibility comes with a resignation the department recognizes the understandable concerns expressed by the public congress in the newsmedia in terms of notification time lines and dot transparency ni want a under score again the secretary austen has taken responsibility for the issues with transparency and the department is taking immediate stepsto improve our notification procedures i get well om why was the notification procedure not ardame place this sems ica petty ovicse when why you need new notification procedures for i'm getting prostate surgery and the number too should be aware of that shoos on vacation by the way abroad meanwhile john curby admitted yesterday the national scurety spokes person he admitted yesterday the yobidon was informed yesterday about austen's prostate cancer the same as we were which is not gray the pennagon already talked about when the secretary was diagnos hi was early december and as ther statement ad in conplictation with his doctors elected ou have the procedure don later in the month to conside with the holidays and as creen rigtly also says the president did not know about the dignosis an tomore but is is reactionis he wishes the secretary all the bes er speedy recovery ow curby was asked i'm do not jus have a cribilig probensol let us just say that for example the at a presiden who seems to be in the thros of dementia why would we possibly believe anything you guies have to say about his health situation concerning the sectaff just when completely absen for wee all having prostate cans or surgery and told no one and no one even bother to note it inside the administration for week why weoble weand anythin wo g and as tration tolters about anything ever agan i think we all recognize and i think the pendigon has been very very honest wit themselves about the the challenge to the credibility by what by what has transparet here by what and by ow how how hard it was ben un to be forly transparent with the marit be why tet we all recognize that and and wya not discommosacon now i know you get another one comon here but but we all recognize that this did not unfold the way you would have on many rebels not just the notification prossess up the canic command but the transparencis we all recognize that it well then why are there no consequences or asaults mean the fact that austin is still working there is pretty insane it is pretty grazy and it does raise the question is who is in charge whisaperi thougt the adults were in charge was not the pitch the pitch was if you elect jobiden and notonal trump you will not ave this chaos any more the world will be a solid place we will go back to normal ry normalill be the new normal and instead what we get is the world on fire and economy in the midst of stagnation the greatestily limegration crisis of our lifetimes and a president whose wandering around into all's occasional wak we ghet that is what we got that does not seem the world's most amazing pitch meanwhile things continue to heat up in the midlesom gan when the reasons things heat up in the mddleleast is because of a perception of weakness the middleast runs on perception of strength it is how the mt e least runs it has always run this way this is not in a rena where good will is blought by pretty words that is not how any of this works and yet that seems to be precisely the policy that is being undertaken by the by diminstration there sending mixe signals all the time on the one hand they are providing support toe israel on the other hand they are triding israel for trying to win a war on the one hand they are saying that they are gone tou prevent who the attacks on shipping on the other hand the're cannot letting the who these attack the shippang and then issuing strongly worded statements sowhich is it because it turns out the preception of confusion on the other side leads to a belief by aron's proxies that they can do what they want in the region and that is raising the temperature dramatically according to the washington post quo disagreements between the united states in israel over the jewish states streatment of palistinians emerged thering secretary of state ansny blincon's visit to israel on tuesday as leaders arita e posing views over when palistinians can return to northern gossa and receive tax revenue collected by israel blinkon told reporters these are their revenues they should have them who are they who are they by what mechanism will these tax revenues be dispersed they doub youth big question the where is the money go it is not as though israel drops a halicoppter filled with money over the gossostrip or over ginine the money will have to go somewhere presumably it would go to the distributing authority an goses still comos which is still presiding over there where are the concot palstinan taxmonygoo go to fata the military wing of the palcinian authority the palcing authority is literally paying the families of people who murdered people on october seventh why should israel give money to that group than these are the mixed signals we at to more in just one second first the

university private christian affordable is e g c udoddy to you to day on the one hand you hve tenty blinkonsaing the correct thing that commass could ave ended this october eighth simply by surrendering and giving up the hossages and they did not hear as blinkin saying the right thing an then we will see blinkins an many of the wrong things ithink it is very important to remember that everyone has coiceis to make and that includs som oss hamos could have ended this october eighth by not hiding behind civilians by putting down its weapons by surrendering by releasing the hossages none of the suffering none of the suffering would have happened is hamas havent done didn did what it did on october seventh and had it made different decisions thereafter case o that happens to be correct but then on the other hand is trying to hold israel's arms behind it is back he suggested yesterday that the big promise that israel is some halitaking steps under cutting palstinins ability to govern themselves effectively om i have a question when have palistinians ever govern themselves effectively name a time any time buler buler this chrisis is clarified yyou cannot have one without the other and you cant heve either go without an integrated regional approach to make this possible israel must be a ardner to palistining leaders wofre willing to leave their people in living side by side in piece wit israel and as neighbors and israel must be at must tot taking stats tunder cut palistings ability to govern themselves effectively excan a settly violence carried out with inpunity settlement expansion demolitions of victions all make it harder not easier israel god cheev lasting pece insecurity hate is absolute stupidity is a stupidity hand what he is saying at the beginng of that quellerhy says the goals are tainable together what are the goals one would be peace with the palstonians in the other of be pece of the surrounding arab states tis going back to the old john carry line that the only way to achieve pie in the region is to make concessions to terris groups which of course is a lie and the opposite of the truth israel was able to engage in the abraham l cords under the trump administration tbecause the trumped ministration made clear that economic tizes with israel in no way depended on israel making concessions to say the palistonian authority when hes suggests to what is under cutting palistonian self governments is for example settlement expansion why why i've a question why is building an extra bedrooment of out what is that of anything to do with the fact that there has not been in election inside palistonian governed areas for nearly two decates explain sure sellon here why i want her why it is that israel allowing for example the expansion of nevade daniel is somehow impacting the fact that the palistonians refuse to elect governments that actually pick up the trash please explain please explain how israel completely abandoning the gossis trip re moving eight thousand jews from the gossaistrip no settlement that toty nothing happening there complete self governents by commass why exactly did that not result in something beautiful was that also because o israel lice this is allso stupid but again the reason that he is sending these mix signals is in the hopes that somehow that is going to buy the love of the egyptians or the salties he is completely misreading the room the egyptians and the souties do not believe that the palistonians are capable of moderation or self governments why they believe that you kow i know they believe that they will not takn any palistonian refuges none and one of the big questions here that the united states keeps rasing his now their members of the israely government was said that they want palistonians to leave gossap tay forget about that for a second because nittin ow who says he is not con to do that let us talk instead about the fact that if you were living in gosa might you want to leave it might you wan't to not a gri place to live havene'n a griplace lif for very long time not lot of people moving to gosa not tones of people were or i've even before all of this where you knowhre i'd love to live under the auspicies of comas in goza what if people want to leave well egypt will not take them souty will not take them jordan will not take them no one will take them why do you think that is why do yo thing that is could it be because historically speakim palistnian populations havebeen a dstabilizing force in every region where they have entered and could that be because they are extremely polarized could it be because the palistonian population itself is extremely extremely radical nd that is not mean that ifr is a terrist does not mean peoples are to be killed what it does mean is that if you are going to ascess is security situation the mdaeleast with out that factor youare completely missing the deciding factor on this issue youare saying that israel can only make some sort of peace with talty arabia for example by somehow making concessions two governments that dick to torally rule radical populations i idnn't understand the logic there does not mae any sense at all but t's those make signals that are being red in the region and aron is reading that which is whyron continues to push a ron isn is not rationing things down a ron is rathetng things up why is a ron iscan continue to poke an continue to prod until there slapped across the head by somebody t woen require the united states to quon't put invade eron wen require a full skill worthron and would require for example killing amunchter whothies along the coasting yammon to stop them from holding up global shipping bhich is something the united states ectualy does have a pritty strong direct interest in but t aby he mistrish refuses to do any of that and meanwhile the question becomes on the other side of the isle cans onal trum take advantage of all of this cas or is he gen create a grease fire here on the stove of his own well get's that in a second first you may have noticed that we at the dailyware we biology because biology says they are only two sexes were not afraid to say it but some of our loyal customers points out a flaw in our jermys shop we only getter to one of the sexes o jermy's razors is all about equal opportunity to shop the woke free economy and that is why we have jermy's razors for the ladies because women deserve the same quality woke free blades as men two sexes two razors is really is that simple when god makes a new sec jermies will make a new razor plus we have a line of personal care products or a better haves including moisterizing shave creem lotion bodywash and deoderant ladies hatdn over t jermy's razors tought tom get your razor and personal care products to day o cam meanwhile now gain you woud imagin that all of this would provide foder fradonald trump run now let us be clear don tru is't get the nominate there are some poles out of for example new hampshire that are shwing nickey haly in pretty solid position in new hampshire to possibly win that state of chris christy it it is hilariusom in that cris christy continues to pretend that he is a person in this race and you on talk about somebody who has an ego problem i'm not sure there is ever been a politicion cris christy who literally just stays in races to alow the person he claims to be the greatest threats of the republican party to win bu chris christy being in the racin new hampshire is unbelievably insane i cannot even explain how dom that is mean in new hampshire right now the latest pulling in new hampshire from see an end and universty new hampshire shows trump up thirty unine thirty two on hailey that is spitting distance and chris christy is pulling twelve per cent why is chris christy in this race i love that he is basicallak scritman i'm staying in no matter what for no reason just to be a jackass the ot a respect that yot ar it yout a respect the play meanwhile in ia by every available pole donal trump is way out ahead of the field according to most poles basically haly anto santis are running neck and neck in iwan now again iwa is not a direct pulling state i was a caucas state the fact that tis hamps has done a lot of heavy on the groun lifting in iwa i think that means he out performs his pull numbers in iwa but right now obviously trump is up way ahead of the rest of the field when it comes to south carolina i'm always surprise that they do not do more pulling of of south carolina is hois kond of shocking to me but there has not actually been a lot of pulling of south carolina in the jeopenomination process the pulling tat there has been at this point shows trump well ahead of the field the latest pull average trum five thirtyeight pass trump up at fifty two point nine per sent helee at twenty four anto stancis town a twelve point seven per cent way ahead of the rest of the field combined if haily wourd when new hampshire youould expect to see a bit of an upserch for but let us assume for the sake of argument bes thasts were the statar the trump is the nominy well the reason trump would be the nominy and the reason that trump presumably would be a formidable challenger to jobidon is because again people look at twenty nineteen and thy look at twenty twenty three and they say twenty nineteen was better than twenty twenty three and most sane and rational people do not blame trump for covid because how could yo possibly do that that they would be a weird thing to do jame dimon here he recently said that the reason the people are voting for trump is because the economy under donal trump was better i think we should stop an sulting o the side in cludi maga i i mention pobically mane times it lot i peoble voti for presen trum nout because they believ in his cham we naus but they look at son the things you did egu thea tnamy i hofs right about nad oe thi spand ort mon ye's rght about point out about china i now he wa right about that your some baglations do not clos pit about bu that is whide avoting form i neen the demi crash bel mor thought ful when the trung about magisy why ni not in thin not dont aclig eve ry act ti bet of trump is nat to be to nat is just not tru g he is right about all that it would make this lot easier as if trump it jus talk about that agan trump is the easiest campain in the world his campaign involves looking donald southernland at the end of invation of the bodys snatchers pointing at trobidon that is the entire campaign he is goes and that is it that is the campaign right look adatgi that is the campaign instead wergan ing at the grease fire apparently trumps camp trying to claim that he has presidential immunity for everything involving january sex that is a weird claim because again there is a difference between donal trumps sur political aspirations and donald trumps public duties as president of the united states it' the arguments tht his lawyers are now being forced to make on behalf presidential munity are little weird according to the wallstry journal the legal reckoning for donald trump entered a critical stretch tuesday as a washington federal a pullic court signales it would reject the former president's claim he is immune from prosecution on chargers he plotted to overturn the twenty twenty lection out by the way this does not speak to the guilt or innocence here it does not peak o weather it is criminal to as spows a specious legal theory which is in my opinion what donald trump was doing for a couple of months there that is not criminal activity thats just arguing really really dum crap in a court which people do pretty frequently in this country as it turns out but putting that aside the presidential immunity thury that trump is pwenting four here is just bad it is not a good presidential immunity theory it is o he is suggesting apparently that he has immunity for literally everything he did while he was president of the united states in fact trump warrnt of bedlum if he was denied immunity here he was explaining thers a y temy moin i you hae be jorin at ei oss the wa ta wan asnot eway gos eheiss president as ne s theoere panoras bas s it is a rsa thing i han witis alls i ulation when theys ara thretse democracy thas torea re to oursy ogasesoit is a thrats democracy to remove him from ballats will inaly that is a threats democracy is not a threats democracy to say the president is not have immunity for literally everything he does while he is president of the united states the argument his lawyers are making is that the impeachment claws in the constitution requires that the president be impeach before he is criminally tried for any sort of offence and the jrudges were i really the question they asked was if the president of the united states for example ordered seal teem six to assassinate his political rivals could he then be charged on that without being impeached and trumps layers no he would bet have to be impeached a first which is a wild statement mean that that seems very very difficult the idea that that somehow the president could order the murder of his political rivals and immunity would still guard him for that murder domestic american political rivals first of all that would creates the that would crat the prospect very obviously and easily of the president of te united states let say for example here impeach and he had not yet been convicted by the senate or selt im six to kill every one in the senate would vote for his conviction and now there is no one left to vote for his conviction and thus criminal conviction a agan that thiss is this argument is not going to fly and court it is just nopling to s a trump is not going be imun the probam is if we are taught every moment were talking about that sort of stuf were not talking about the fact that jobidon is an awful terrible very not good president and let us be real about this when it comes to the feeling of casts in the country it is not simply coming from trump a trumps fest argument is in facts an argument he is making which that the threats ondemocracy is coming that the call it is coming from insde the house jobidon is the one whose claiming his opponents are insurrectionist and therefore theoretically ouht to be ban from ballots meanwhile we do live in a country where journalists routinely joke apparently about the assassination of donald trump caught on a hot mike yesterday donal trump was arriving and court on this particular case journalists were caught on a hot mite joking about donald trump being shot he oman e o me jaf cas astination how ga we till o kow who these journalists are by the i i've a feeling that they will be exposed in probably lose their jobs over something that all of this obviously contributing to a feeling of great un ease among members of theamerican population on both sides valls have said before we have now set up a model by which violence is very likely to break out no matter who wins the election if tonal trump wins do you think domocrats aregn to take that lying down or do you thin tha they are going to claim that dictatorship is inevitable now man it is literally whach ralighten is arguing that the nosies are in charge of gobidon winds emen if theyf down trump winds and in if fon trump winds do you think that things will remain calm in the streets i think not meanwhile if jobidon winds at this point and doel trump has been hit by his go jay in too separate juristictions in washington to s and florida do you think that that donal trum supporters are going to take that lying down or is his case that he has been rigged out of the election again going to be a lot more credible this time at than it eves even was last time things ing at very very nasty in the country which of courses is why the washington posed is runng pieces violent political threats surge as twenty twenty four begins hlaunting american democracy now the entire article is largely about the evils of donal from supporters but let us be clear the threats a violence are not coming from only one side of the isle the amount of a violence that is now being threaten against commonamerican citizens forget about public officials is really significant and i's gon o continue to rise because the feeling is that institutions have fail and as the feeling than institutions are failing grows in impact chaos comes in its way by the way thete's not a uniquely american problem you are ciring to see this literally all over the world there is a feeling that the institutions of government in many western country have failed large swaths of the population and people are beginning to take to the streets in response to big story that is been under covered by the media has been this huge farmer protest in berlin according o these soce to prest farmers blocked highway access roads in parts of germany on monday and snarl traffic elsewhere with their tractors launching a week of protest against th government plan to scrap tax breaks on deasil used in agriculture chancellor all off shoalds on popular three parti polition infuriated farmers last month by drawing up plans to a bolish a car tax exemption for farming vehicles and deasil taxbreaks those proposals were part of a package to fill a giant eighteen billion dollar whole in the twenty weny for budget that home budget is really an invirimentalist whole in the budget here is what some of the pictures look a manu ecnsy it is insaned me there snarling oplic all of berlin there some ofthe vidio wen tery much he canadian truncker's protest over the covenineteen shut downs in canada and your en to see the sort of stuff happening in western capitals all over the place the protests are under scrutiny after a grup of farmers on thursday prevented the vice chancelor rober hayback from disembarking of fairy an a small north seeport as you return from a personal trip to an offshore island that incident drew condemnation from both government and opposition figures as well as the farmers association there lot of people on the left in germany hard deeply worriedtha this is going to boose the right which of course it well mean that is exactly what happened by the waiyt in the netherlands all over europe thereare lots of farmers hore saying lessent you have put your green dreams on our back you ave said that we cannot farmany more you hve put all sorts o restrictions on our use of nitrogen and the soil for example you have basically forced us to consolidate all of our farms and take out debt to do and the new prevented us from doing the farming this is what led to the giant dutch nitrogen crisis which is still rocking the country that is happening in germany it is happening in the netherlands as well no all of this is zom ou's just part and parcel of a brader right rightwing uprising that is happening across the continent over in poland you have a true constitutional crisis that is breaking out as well poland has very weird kind of government structure you have the prime minister who has most o the power but of the president who has vedo power and the ability to a prove governments and not a proe government you elsesto have two separate corts the supreme court and the constitutional cort of justice in poland and the sort of covered different areas whatl turns out this division of power has led to the domination of one of those divisions by the right wing and one of those visions by a european intogrationist party led by donald tusk well this in turn has led to a stand off between these two wings of the polish government according to politico in an drmatic ask collation of poland's battle to restore rule of law the police enterd the country's presidential palice on tuesday evening and took two mps into custody ho had been hiding under the protection of the president whose name is undrich duda after being sentence to prison trms for abuse of power yhou arrest cut to the hart of the fight between duda and the new primemanistr donal tusk who is seeking to enravel eight years of rule by the nationalist and conservative law and justice party juda is a line with pa s and sell s considerable ability to thwart tusks attempts at reform basically the re two convicted lawmakers who had ben given a pardon and tusk is now arguing that the pardon was no good and the president sang the pardon absolutely was good dutus as he pardon these two and twenty fifteen during their trial for using fic documents in an earlier attemptoin criminate colishan allies of law and justis there re oping to destroy that smaller colition party and then integrat the members and apparently that failed inthe overnment below part in twenty seventeen polen supreme court ruled the presidential pardon was not effective becase it wash granted before a final verdict in the case there are thing the camp preemptively granto pardon tbefore somemody's been convicted in criminal court but the constitutional tribunal c os the other court which usually describes constitutionallistions they said that the pardon was in order n have a battle between the constitutio al tribunal an the supremeport between the prime minister and the president in poland all of this because you basically have gridloch in poland over the future of the country the parliament of poland is by cameral but the lower house is called the same in speld ts e j m s pronounce same in in sere american and a the biggest party there is the law in justice party they still have a hundred ninety four out forhrnisixty seets in the parliament and they still dominate a lot of the proceeding you have this break down in polans yo break down in poland you have break down in germany you have break down in the netherlands you ave break down in france as well one o the big probes in france right now is that manual mc chrone is deeply un popular the rising party is the nationalist party that is led by marine lapen right now the lopen party is leading in the poland by a significant margen c corning two politico in europe mc crone is looking to rejuvinate his troubled seconterm aft for facing mass protests against pensions last year and benner descent within his own camp over an emigration bill which left his governing polition badly bruse mc crones pick coms is the president he e just pickd the new prime ministers a thirty four year old guy and he passed over bunch members of his own party an or do creeting real dist conten win than its on on poalition his pit comes the president curntly holds a thorty per cent approval rating his colition trails the faright national ralley by about ten points in european election poland france is about to turn tothe rightsyof italy which is turned to the right if germany which is beinning to turn to the right and ye france which istarting to tern t the right in fact this is leading to crisis calls and good inside the european parliament has he inside the european parliament there is a rise of bright wing parties this means that the head of the european parliaments liberals with the oretically could crate sort of a centor right coalition is outright refusing to work with any of the rightling parties polles suggest tha the current holition of conservative social democrats and liberals in the european parliament will cobbled together a majority but only just because right an parrigt groups are surging in popularity the head of that liberal colition whos name is stephan sa jorn he said we are risking an un governable europe itis quite real in terms of arithmetic sejorne is closhes with the manual mc crone he said he will not agree to work with the far right in the next yeuropean parliament he refuse to line with the nationalist european conseraties and reformaus group the ecar which contains the law in justice party as well as pans vox party as well as presumbly the national rally party in france sergan try to hold the senter good luck to that good luck and m again as all these institutions feel they have bid off more than they can cho and they are failing and there aspirations for a green new world order are folling part the backlach is very real in its only going to grow already gos the rest of the

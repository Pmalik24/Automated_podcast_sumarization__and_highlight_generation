from w be easy chicago it is this american life our glassis off this week i'm shon call there is this guy who is been on our show a few times now kirk jonsen he is this extraordinary person in his early twenties he went to a rock and rand rebuilding projects and filuga for uessay ide after the invasion he saw that a rockyes who worked for the ues military were being threatened and killed because of it and were not getting asylum in the uss and he was outraged hes single handedly launchd to campaign which changed us lawn thus and for years after he champion these cases saving thousands of people's lives it was beyond difficult anextraordinary strusful job and did decompress kirk took up fly fishing which his were today story actually starts it has nothing to do with a rock or refuges begins on a river in new mexico flyfishing just in case you do not know you are using the special lure that looks an insect ass the fly clotes on the water kirk makes his own flies out things rabbit fir taking parts of one kind of animal using it to imitate another kind in order to catch a hird kime kirks on the river with this guide guy nam spencer signe as his back in two thousand eleven and at one point spencer reaches down to fetch something out of his tackle box ins kirk and i caught this really colorful flash really beautiful looking fly and asked him what it was and he he pulls this thing out and it is its hit is a salmon fly that is it is used to catch salmon kirk hoad only ever seen trout flies which are kind of brown or gray but this thing was intricately tied together with bird feathers and silvery thread may be an inch and a half long ind of a moth sized peacock an impressionists version of an insect were a dream about an insect and it is got these emrolld and canary yellow and ruby colored strips from feathers of of these exotic birds may be it ten or twelve species in total and the're arranged in this realy or nate pattern were the hookclets in the barbules bok cannect this gets realy n narty yet but iad never see anything it it is a beautiful piece of art and he then said to me goes will syou think that is crazy should hereabout this kid who just broke into the british museum of natural history to steel hundreds of these exotic birds for their feathers which he sold to victorian salmon fly tires cause he wanted to buy a new golden flute an actual flute a musical instrument made of gold and a as soon as he said that imn ow ii'm not i'm not over dramatizes in the moment i was in the middle of a cast when he was tell me this and i just kind of froze i was this is the craziest sentence ive i've heard kirk sturted plying spencer with questions on the spot he wanted to know everything they went back to spencer's place that night and looked up the kid's profile on face book his name edwin wrist r i s t and even that did not seem a real name to me it seemed some nineteenth century he is one of these vic torian boxers edwin had broken into the museum two years earlier an two thousand nine swas a branch of britton's natural history musam in a little town called tran kirk starts gouggling around to read everything he can find out about the case but there was not much just a few articles in the british press that covered the basics which work edwin wrist was from new york originally was in london studing musec is exceptionally talent at a flut he was only twenty when he stold the birds two hundred ninety nine of them and not just any ded birds there were from one of the most im portant collections and scientific history and also their feathers would fetch about a million dollars if he took them apart and sold them to salmon fly tires whic you did some of them nd he was caught the pleace arrested him and yet somehow yoe was now walking around free odditioning for orchestras in europe and a huge number of the birds were still an accounted for kirk wanted to understand how this happend that a twenty year old flowdest with no particular experience in museum larsany made off with some of the most precious specimens in the world and hy wandered where the missing birds were kirk's guyde spencer told him if you really want to find this specimens you should get yourself to the twenty first annual international fly tying simposium was in sommer sent new jersey a the double tree hotelind conferent center but a hundred people were there if you been to any trayshow you can picture it sort of a maze of booths selling all kinds of fly tying supplies hook's thread feathers and you by whole birds there too i i went to into one guy's booth an he had dom a pretty large box just full of parakeet heads and the all of their beaks were kind of open they were chirpin at the moment o i will not go to gory there but tem were you about to say at the moment of their death yes sgas isa say at the moment of very decapitati but there are bits of birds everywhere the gy woith the parakeed heads was busily tying a fly and a hook clamped in a little vice and attached the feathers with thread wrapping it around the shaft all of these spectators were gathered around him he was a side walk magician doing a trick kirk post is a customer at first but the guy could tell he was not serious about buying anything kirk finally came clean and said to him thathe was thinking of writing something about that museum hice and he looks up from his fly and he said i do not think you won a wriht that story and i i said no wwhy and he goes because were a small titni community in you do not want to piss us off and im what i was just let momentarily stunned but in in my mind i was holycalis is ofso ias what would happen if you pissed them off i do not knownly lik pull this cardow but i feew my time in foluja has cawlubrated my threat perception of a bitdifferently wul ye maand a do to the bunch of feathers pinch between his fingers does not constitute a threat to me nthat gis threat had the exact opposite effect on kirk than he intend it and something kickd in for kirk at this play could sometimes does when he gets an idea an his hent to me it was just a very clear flare fire if he was trying to turn me away from thi story it was just it was he had just filled my tancop it was you it was e pay more attention to this this is crazy it is crazy the stuff kirk found out i cannot turn away once you stort hearing all the dt tails not just about the highest and rest but where the birds came from and the whole sereal sub culture of samon flytying what kirk calls the feather undergrout sometimes characterized by shady dealings and obsession kirk interviewed more than fifty fly tires and discovered things that thet people investigating the case did not find out and that is our show to day the story of what may be the ratest feather keeper in history expect hi drama and ornithology instay wus o o o o oo on o acked one the specimens e quirk warning let this episode contont threw swearwords that wiv unbeepd for the podcast version you can find virgion with beeps at our websighte this american life tot word the birds had wh n stoll i said thye were valuable some of them were collected in the mid eighteen hundreds by one of the greatest scientific explorers of his time a man named alfred russell wallase he was another darwin and a peer of darwins alfred wallace spent nearly a decade thrashing through the malayarca pelago capturing in preparing animal specimens and shipping them back to england he lived in tiny huts his flesh regularly invaded by bugs and about four years in he contracted malaria an figurete wuld just hunker down in his shack to swett it out and while he is yet in the middle of this fever he has a eureca moment and figures out evolution through natural selection completely on his own he is i've got it i figured it out and this is before darwin came up with it but this is the kicker he sits down and he writes this paper meant for publication and he puts it an envelope en he mails to charles dar ywho had never publish anything on this yet darwin had figured it oup too at that point but he had been too scared to put it out there these specimens were as important as darwin's finches which by the way or also at the trin museum their early evidence of evolutionary theory and specimens these can inform scientists about everything from climate change to the way we prerceive color scientists are still using them alfred wallace himself once wrote that each species each bird is an individual letter building the wirds and sentences that described the deep history of our planet if we allow these letters to disappear that history disappears with them he also wrote that it is probably best if people from the west never sea birds these in their original habitat andall their beauty and glory because they just plunder them in ruin everything he had no idea how right he would turn out to be not long after there was an industrialized slaughter all over the world and it was in in the name of women's fashion this was back when women were a lot of hats and anyone who was anyone were hats with a lot of feathers on them from parrots egrets ossprays desiners in the ouess in europe could not get enough of the stuff whole species were decimated by the fashion in the sry you see hats decorated with in tiher birds in the nineteenth century this was the guchy bag if you could only afford to robin that was one thing but if you could afford a bird of paradise and were talking about the whole bird being mounted with outstretched wings and and immenian sometimes these hats had several different birds mounted on them holy cro and it i and it is eum i mean thats it is punny but it is it was how they demonstrated their own perch in society some women had many birds on their hats that they had desquat just in order to fit into their carriages gaudy and inconvenient meanwhile the gentlemen of the araw were also sort of using feathers as excessories salmon flies were hats for gies this was also round the time that all these exclusive fishing clubs were popping up on the coasts of england in scotland and each club had its own special patented salmon fly and the flies themselves had all these name s theyre absurd there thed exortium the jack scot the durham's ranger can i i just wanted toi just i just a give people a sense of o case o this is the recipe for the first fly that sammon fly that edwin ever tied it is called the durham ranger this is a recipe from the eighteen forties ind the coloredto recipe yes the tale calls for feathers from the indian crow which is the red rough fruit crow that is all over south america the but requires two turns of black ostrich hurl am the throat has light blue hackel usually from the katinga ah which is from central america the wings have a pair of long jungle cock feathers with double tipits on both sides it goes on that the chee sir from te bird called a chatterer the horns or bluema caw ic was a parot of course back then when you wanted these feathers you went down to the local plume merchant or in paris of plumacier and you paid real money roun the ou're nineteen hundred certain snowy egret feathers were more expensive than gold for me all i cap fixating on was that this is this is all bulshet has there is no reason why a salmon should care about any of this they do not i mean you you could tie a chocolate wrapper to a hook and catch salmon oh all of these littld subtle tees of which sub species did you use for the cheek of the feather they do not even see any of that that that' idn't matter to victorian salmon flytires back theme and these days the community tying this kind of fly still tries to do it according to the same classical recipes in these one hundred year old manuels except now they do not even fish with them they are just for show heus feathers from the same species arranged the same exact way the vixation is on historical authenticity a fly ting version are civil worry in acting but because we have murdered many birds for many reasons over the years a lot of the most coveted species are now endangered or protected there is a species of katinga that is just completely i legal to to buy in sallats the katinga macuata and they they completely jones over this stuff i have been struggling to find another hobby who is adherents are quickly driven to break international laws hen to do the art i mean you do not get into the dark side of knitting of course not every salmon flytire is breaking the law but some of them openly flout the rules ore just ignore them violators can be fine thousands of dollars there was a post on the main web form for this hobby classic flytying dot come that soms up thi slavish addiction to certain feathers one guy said there is somethingto a fly tied with the old materials and someone else responded i've met this something i'm haunted by it constantly now it is a drug nothing else matters nothing else compares when it touches my fingers i feel the history am taken back to a time when fish were as big as logs fresh from the sea reds yellows and shades of blues they are texture and color an that power to push you to do your best here was nothing else that compares to that power ac to the floudist er gone to to talk o ther edwin rest the e melled him every now and then o wet th forse of three years asking for an interview edwin always said no it was to fo raw and then finely you agreed gave kirk a week's notice kirk and his wife marijoset fluted duzuldwarf where edwin was living playing in an onsondl twhich is the music you are hearing wri know but marijiose was worried they did not know the sky you broken into a museum after all who knew what he was capable of he was dangerous and they were meeting him at their hotel room they hired a german body guard who sat out in the hallway during the aight hour interview they need not have bothered edwin well taul was not imposing even in his black peacoat he was friendly kark him though they are very different kirk's oggosh farmboy amidwesternness and edwin's living in a rarefied world of flutes and feathers in europe we asked edwin if we could air parts of their interview on the show and he said no yeu will not hear his voice but a lot of what we know about how he came to be in the museum that night come straight from him he grow up in a quiet town in new york state south of albany huscut a sort of hairy potter with thick wirehim glasses bit of an endoorsy kid home schooled along with his younger brother and even back then he was shaping up to be a great musicion edwin's parents were both journalists and when edwin was about ten his dad was researching his story for discover magazine about the physics of fly casting edwin happened to watch an instructional vidio on how to tie flies using the specific kind of feather called a hackl o wable let us ty the hackle around the base of the way that it floats lower in the surface and perhaps looks a may fly a rest and te feather is transformed it it suddenly the hook hads a thousand little legs sticking out in every different direction now it looks a lick a senape yes and for whatever reason ten year old edwin's brain was just frozen by this seen something ordinary transform into something extraordinary that was amazing to him edwin told kirk that he and his brother watched that part of the vidiomi eight tives and soon he was rummaging through the gorrage in the basemen looking for a hook and thread anything he could find to tryat himself he plucked the feathers from his moms down pillow his dad seeing all of this finally brought edwin to a tackleshop got him a vice and some hooks and other materials he could start tying flies for real troub flies to begin with the ugly ones edwin's brother got into a two they took classes spent hours hunkered over their creations an this kind of fuzzy trainns before too long there were winning fly tying competitions and going to conventions and it was at one of those conventions were edwin laid eyes on his first sammon fly it was at the booth of a prominent fly tirant named edward muzzeroll or muzzy for short and once again little edwin's mind just froze it was the same reaction kirk hat that day on the water total be dazzlement and he is kind of owin and in and he starts talking to muzzy and then before it he is arranging for private lessons with muzzy to learn how to do this this new type of fly tin new to edwin and i think he was fourteen when he went up to main one summer and and got lessons i think it was eight or twelve hour days fer muzzy proceeded to walk om through not just the the techniques but the history of this art form during that firstatorial with muzzy though where edwin tied the durham ranger they used substitute feathers or subs meaning no redrough fruit crow no black ostrich ral insteadly used died chicken feathers or whatever and muzzy h' been tying flies longer than edwin had been alive could tell right away that edwin was a natural a prodigy and at the end of that session that first session when muzzy' saying good by he gives edwin an envelope and n in hush tone said this is what it is all about edwin opens the envelope and inside is a hundred and fifty or two hundred dollars worth of exotic bird feathers from the redra fruit crow and from katinga i think now muzzy's stuff was legal and it was a gesture to this young akoliht almust a work your way up to these things when you get good enough ter try using one of these redra frut cro feathers in that is when edwin caught the bug all he wanted to use in his flies were exotic bird feathers from then on he started doing cures for his neighbors gathering firewood just for little extra feather money he soon grew into a master fly tire which by the way means an expert mimicer able too consistently and perfectly hue to the same classic recipes again and again ut thre was always this one limitation as to what he could accomplish as good as edwin got and and m he was heralded as the future of fly tine by fly tire magazine which i subscribed to aly to he olt he was completely embraced by this community by his sixteenth birthday think when he was a lengent already but as good as he was he was a sixteen year old who was not really flush with cash and whenever there was these occasional e bay auctions of of the species that he wanted he always got outbid by these wealthier older fly tires who had disposal income and he is devotion to this art form was kind of always to fined by a longing for what he did not have these other guides would say the i wil it is a good fly but i no talk to me when he gets im real katinga that is not enough fofl that good no especially to a kid edwin has thi specific way of talking perhaps cultivated from living in europe for many years and on the topic of using substitute feathers instead of the real thing he told kirk the knowledge of its falsity eats at you in a way edin was a popper musition gazing through a shop window at a shiny musical instrument which by the way he literally was that too at the same time he was excelling at fly tying he was also excelling at the flute just to give you a sense this is a you tu vidio edwin posted of him covering master of popet's by metalica playing all the parts on different flutes anyway he was finally admitted to the royal academy of music in london but he did not bring any of his fly tine year or feathers with him he said customs would not of appreciated his birdiy bag around the same time a fly tying friend in canada and something of a mentor to edwin sent him in email saying basically heh while you 're over there you have got a chick out this place north of london a branch of the natural history museum an a town called tring he attached pictures of drawers filled with brilliantly colorful bird specimen s they worn't on display there wre stored away in a special wing of the museum that the general public is not alowed into actry the museum the train is this big old brictutor building from the eighteen eighties and the outside it looks more a private mansion or a boy school than a museum the only way you can see that special bird collection is for legitimate research purposes edwin came up with a plan a line he emailed the museum and told them he needed to fphotograph the birds for a friend's page dfesis and on november fifth two thousand at he brought a camera to the museum signed the visitor log book using his own name and was escorted to the birds of paradise collection you can tell a research specimen of a bird from a mile away their eye sockets are stuffed with cotton theire wings folded down at their sides legs stiff there referred to as bird skins and importantly the legs have these tags attached to them with the species and date and other byodata and in this case alfred wallace's signature without that tag the specimen is not a specimen any more it is just a bird who knows where the hellit came from but research of course was the last thing on edwin's mind looking at the birds he was just an awe of their arresting beauty he made this analogy he said if i put a gold brick on the table it is really impressive there is a shock value of understanding while that is really valuable and then this is the this is what he told me hegos if you go to fort knocks if you go into the vault there is a drastically different feeling then just seen ic a gold brick quote for a fly tire for some one who understands the feathers and sees the potentoin then and who really has a passion i guess you call it an abs ession i do not to use it because it sounds a negative term but that overwhelming wo what have i just seen feeling was all that i had and i remember it to this point because it was just extraordinary and the sad thing he told me y is that man many many well most people have no idea what that feels oedwin photographed all sorts of different species of birds that day and he says he was not casing the museum that first time he just wanted to look except he also took pictures of the area around the museum those surely were not interesting photographs thut they may have proved useful later on outn also he opens up mikrusev word on his computer and creates a file called plan for museum invasion data e e ta e egget uand's a little on the i do not but you do not think anyone's ever going to see your hard drive in some ways it was a it is a smart thing to do to build a list of the things that you are gin to need to pull off a museum heighes you do not want just wing that wing e t no but i ma hhe wrote on there that m he would need a glass cutter and i said was this one of those things you seen the movy were it is some perfect disshaved gla exactly acan pink pan ye and it it was just a hand held almost an exact o knife and as likale did you practicse and hes now i do not think it could be that hard the evening of june twenty third two thousand nine edwin finished playing a concert at the royal acat o me of music and borded a train to train according to him he brought along only one empty suitcase a pair of latex' gloves he took from his doctors office some wire clippers a little ely delikhe and the glass cutter at for o the higheste came o ai came u no thi ting on foot wi i sca on the noing tikin u hedfol the detective on the case a dell hopkin took cirk to the crime scene up public foot past thirty seven and trin to a sort of secluded area outside the museum n te camet o men a then he tan e shm u e fol whic es tol a up hers the solt he clipped some strands of barbed wire in order to get to a window this wend i her which snuggle to balls and was the reason he brought the glass cutter which it turns out he dropped along the way somewhere he had a moment of doubt were he started saying to himself may be that some kind of sighin that thot's pls to do this maybe i should just bal on this whole thing but that this other voice in his head said no you have been planning this for everlike just figure it out he used a different kind of glass cutter e giant rock an an i just smushed to one of he windows and an en wins in edwin says he is not sure how he did not caut himself up on the glass and an alarm is triggerd in the museum and there is a security guard there that night this is a very contentious point but edwin told me that he thinks that the security guard was engrossed in a socker match the museum viulently denies this and they told me the security that particular security guard does not even socker but one thing that were certain of is that an alarm was trigger e security guard did not notice it in edwin had the run of the place an he was in there undetected for at least an hour it was a weirdly easy thing to pull off his plan had just been to take a couple of the best specimens of each species but in the dark with just as little ellidy pinch light he could not see which were the best ones he just s tarted grabbing whatever he could fit in his hands the ka tingas were small ae bagged about a hundred of those the resplendent cetsalls though were trickier e had the carefully coiled their long tails and ord to make them thit he moved from cabinet to cabinet sometimes emptying hole drawers were nearly he took forty seven of the museums forty eight red rough fruit crow he only left the last one as he did not see at wedge in the back of the tray because he is been it befol you xacatska wor he wonc sit to te suitcas it jba chatasi kark tried to get edwin to describe the feeling that he had loading the birds in to the suit case but sitting together in the hotell in duzildor edwin was strangely devoid on thi score he told kirk it was not otheir mind now hohoho it was surprisingly unexciting and tecnical how do i make them fit thugh he did admit that even he was amazed he managed to pull it off edwin said quote the fact that essentially an idiot with a rock could steal a suit case full of birds from the natural history museum even as i think about it and i'v thought about this myself it is absurd and then he went out the way he came in shot the suit case back out of the window first and climbed out after it at which point this total exhaustion fell over him dragging one foot after the other back to town and mixed in with the fatigue was paronoia when he got to the train platform every set of footvalls on the walkway above him was a potential thread and he was there for hours he had missed the last train back to london that night and had to sit on the platform with a million dollars worth of birds until four in the morning he gomt back to his room had this kind of vuforic moment where he laid out all the birds and cun of realized that the successive his hall on the floor or i i think he laid him out on his bed te roll aroun and it tat birds ian that i do not know badam there was nobody else on planet earth that had this many flalas specimens of these species to now be sitting with this hall i het would just he would punch through to the highest level of fly tine ecause he would not want for anything and he would just have this kind of he he could just totally in a different game now and no one else is able to play with it and if they wanted to play they would have to pay through the nose again edwin had stolen two hundred ninety nine birds from the museum h would never have to wonder again where his next feather was coming from the broken window was not discovered into the following morning the cops were called in they look around and the museum and the cops together conclude that nothing seems to have been stolen wait what yem they went looking for the things that they knew had a huge market value darwin's birds darwin's birds the famous finches which were still safely cuddled in their drawer once again alfred wallac was second best to darwin ye i went through that is to me it was one of the fine old blows to him is bed if they had cared about wallace as much as they should they would have gone and check to mix sure that wallace is birds were still there but they did not and if they had done that they would have found out right away that they had been robbed they would have had a big had start on things but as it happened it took them almost i couwas well over month before they ven found out thut they were robbed thirty five days in fact the closes circuit survellance cameras in the town of tring reset after twenty eight days ain a statement to us the museum said parfhrasing here that there is nothing more important an the security and welfare of the collection and after the that they changed how they gran access to the collections and also beefed up their security maters an an an n tin the investigation it was only when some one wrote to the museum with a question about one of the species that a curator went to that cabinets opened the drawer and saw that it was emity was a huge below the curators at the tring are part of a long lineage caring for and protecting this collection tduring the blits of london and world were too boms raining down everywhere iy was their predecessors who bundled up the museum sbird specimens and secreted them out of the city up to their new location in traing that is why they are there they would be safe and now under the watch of collections manager robert priest jones this happened there is a missing jhunk from the record im i in something lot find babad it is a missing chungthat a really subsantial pussibly out of the hols of the worlds results all that species is now missing the whole thing was a complete kick in the guts it was desperately deeplyt depresse alfred wallace's birds survived hitler but not edwin rist the investigators did not have a lot of obvious clues to go on thre was almost no physical evidence but had the police or the museum looked in the visitors log the would have found edwin's full name which if some one gugled it they would have found edwin ristot calm on which he was selling some of their specimens using their latin names they also would ave quickly discovered that he played the flute and if they had gone looking for the birds on ebe ere the fly tying for hims they would have found birds for sale from some one with the handle flute player nineteen eighty eight one of the posts was titled indian crowfeathers for sale buying new flute if any of the buyers asked edwin made up stories as to where the birds came from but mostly no one asked they did not want aknow the way edwin finally got caught was sort of random a tip came in from a fly tirer who had seen a bird skin at a fectival and the netherlands of all places that looked it might have come from the train and the guy traced it back to fluteplayer nineteen eighty eight on eba it took some doing but the police finally tracked edwin down and showed up at his apartment with a warrant one year after the break in he confessed immediately brought the officers into his bedroom were his girllfriend was still sleeping and showed them the birds since he confessed and pled guilty the case went right to sentencing edwin was looking at ten years for burglary and fourteen years for selling stolen goods but during the sentencing process edwin's lawyers brought in a psychologist who diagnosed him with aske furker sendrum that changed everything the judge in his statement said that edwin's crime wholly merited a lengthy prison sentence hesaid the crime mounted to quote a natural history disaster of world proportions but he said because of the diagnoses and a legal precedent in the uke involving askpurgers a long prison sentence would probably be overturned on a peal he sentenced edwin to one year suspended there was a financial penalty too but mod tinbehind bars of the two hundred ninety nine birds a third of them came back to the traing onskaight another third had been plucked at were tismantle were in some way compromised chiefly their buyo date attacks had been removed with the date and species and alfred wallace's signature which meant those specimens were now useless to science and the last third did not come back to the museum they were gone missing some of them were sold but certainly not all of them where were they when edwin was caught he pleaded his guilt which meant that the the investigation stopped and there was no search for the for anything else the museum was not looking for it the british police was not looking for it and as i was starting to dig around in these forms thatd i would see occasions or guy's cracking jokes about the heist and it it was not it was a a reformed community iw's this is nots whitwic some haes got find these things and kirk is some one who cannot stop himself when he comes across and injustist that he might actually be able to fix also this unsettling thing happened during the interview kirk says edwin just idn't seem some one with aseburgers and after six of their eight hours together he told him edwin responded that he had not exhibited any obvious symptoms of the disorder until he was in the evaluation room not long before sentencing he said i became exactly what i was supposed to be it fi'm bein ast i was pised off this is this started out as just the corky funny story to me but when i learned about wallace when i learned about the debt that we have to these specimen collections and that they were still out there a lot of them were still missing then it took on is more serious the availance that were suddenly i was locatisis and just a funny thing theirs you cannot go back and get it another bird from eighteen sixty any more that that birds gone and whan i met was a kid who was not remorseful who kind of grimast when i referred to him as a thief at one point and he told me that he does not think of himself as a thief ar wet the anger level at this point probably aapproaching there im becaus now it is his i this is a case clothed and no one's looking for these birds and i'm still on these form seen people trading and selling things that looked suspiciously edwin's birds had edwin hidden a bunch away and was still selling them tos some one else selling them kirk could not let it go and then he had a kind of break throug ad became certain that he knew where all of the missing specimens wer oca ian in coming up cirk goes and confronts his prime suspect and he learns that ornithologists can have serious potty mouths that is in a minute from chicago public radio when our programme continues it is this american life i'm shon cold in for ire glass to dasho the feather highest the true story of one of the weirdest capers in recent history which was also a tragic lost to natural history and it is the story of kirk jonsin who took it upon himself to reinvestigate the theft of two hundred ninety nine bird specimens from the train museum north of london back six the suspect kirk of course asked edwin wrist about the missing birds cans when they wer together in dusildorf edwin told him the police took everything from him they had everything he also in the interview called into question whether the museum knew how many were still missing and suggested they never really knew how many they had in the first place but the people at the traing had given kirk this document a meticulous accounting of what had come back to them and what was still on accounted for and kirk had it with him this is him reading it to edwin in the hotel room i this is li fr thorou li is r es isli eaes wita ror eeri rs is i fri an e s is o hos wer this i said this does not seem haphazard and edwin said no it does not seem haf hazard i would agree it looks very very thorough wn it looks very calculated i guess and i said wel then if that is accurate where are they and he goes if someone has them i really do not know about it and the question then is does one individual have them or is it parcelled out over time and i i look up at him and i said but are not you the person most uniquely position to answer thet and he says in what sen and i look down on us i you are the one that took them andand down after a kond of a long winded a response he said i do not have them fundamentally a is to the word fundamentally yes now a number of edwin's customers returned the feathers and bird parts and whole birds that they bought from him to the museum and some cases edwin's daddre imberst them spending thousands of dollars the museum was now faced with the bazaar task of having to calculate how many feathers woled one red roughed fruit crow an factoring all of that in the number of outstanding birds on the spread sheet shrank down to sixty four and as kirk waited through all of the past sales of birds on line doing wayback machine searches and stuff that the sort of pattern started to emerge that seemed owd there was another user who ad clearly posted specimens that came from edwin stach this different user named gokoo g o k u either it was edwin under another name were some one who was working with him to sell the birds an accomplice and i really did not know the answer for a long time but this gocoo guy suddenly became a big person of interest to me kirk started mapping all of edwin's closest associates in the fly ting world and he developed a short list ast to who gocoo might be if it was not edwin and then one day kirk happened to be visiting with an ornithologist at yale named rick prum one of the head curators of the peabody museum mat karther genius goganheim recipien and you walk in and he is just ropin as basrit and lef lu in i loved this guy and i wrot thes not cos i is trying to get ishal wilents buss these buters rick prum had taken and enraged interest in the trinkcase himself kirk he had taken copious notes kept track of the sales on line and listening to the two of them talk it is they have each met the only other person in the world who ise not only heard of but loves just as passionately the same band he worshiped in high school did you get did you er he ge e get shis wetsid at the day lik when he was bosted what was on his webside his wepsides town a you ever wknowtit i have i got his hole wegsit almost ree at ne and looking at edwin's websight definitively narrowed the short list of who go koo might be down to one guy that o ka long ther right there longe wen long when another top notch fly tire whos exactly edwin's age their friends long wen lives in norway yea t ti bir you have no ideawo tat is mes wied and kirk had other evidence implicating long some face took exchanges edwin saying did yor box arine pictures of the two of them on a tripp to japan after which all kinds of new birds were posted for sale by gocoo not only that other members of the community were openly accusing long of working with edwin telling him we know its you your das er number now edwin has insisted all along that long was not invalved in the highs he is defended long against accusations on the internete and he told kirk that long was not involved and then he put kirkin touch with long and long the only other person kirk knew of who clearly seemed to be selling the stolen birds agreed to talk a seven oslow kirk thught maybe long had been at the museum with edwin that night was always a question as to how edwin pulled this off on his own ay be long ha put him up to it in the first place he picton in being wealthy and manipulatev using ewin as a plone and when kirk's plainlanded in oslow he was just about jumping out of his skin he was eager to talk with long he took a train out to a little suburb of the city long met him at the station he was a teen age looking twenty something with a big smile and chuck tailors i had miraculously convinced him to do the interview at his home ecause i had this kind of fantastic old notion that he would slip up and i would tyou know find som partially exposed wing under the couch or somethig and down a box of dead berrs would come tombling ye ye when he was strying to reach for some sugar packets through something a we walk into the apartment and out of the corner of my eithers this green flash just bomming towards my face and it is his parrot that just was loose in the apartment and and flapped over and enlanded on my shoulder and and and spent most of the i think that was a seven hour interview the first day a sh sh and it was a san uncomfortable interview where i means i'm learning all hese things about his life but also confronting him with suff and his bird is meanwhile and a nibling on my her os ssurar ssw ss wa at ta te quessn f and something else happened when kirk walked into the apartmen all notions of long being the rich conniging master mind of the tranghise fell away long was from a family of the enemy's refuges who had fled the war to norway in the seventyes he started tying flies in a boy's home when he was a kid tbasicallisin skine beas think swer tublent in o family im in yah i do not think about that now because it is possbe the think swer bat am we had to do our best to just go through it with paren s being in vitnamo a af te dran of and long said he never really had what he called true friends and around that same time after he had started tying flies he was reading about other fly tires on line and he heard about this one kid in america who was exactly his age i think i thought harring about advin wos fifteen or sixteen because he was ree a famous peck them long looked up to edwin hey met on line first just writing back and forth at a tunnan commen they decided to me that japan trip was the first time they saw each other in person they tied flies together there edwin had already stolen the birds at that point but he had' been talht yet and he is telling me that edwin reached out to him to ask him to help sell these things but just as a friend he jut said he i i found these things can he post these things on line for me and long thought that that was what being a friend was he thought he was can help edwin make enough money to buy his new flute and he also felt really flattered and honor that edwin wrist was paying attention to him long told kirk he mustly just reporsted some of edwin's ash and pl in pictures of birds but it is true that edwin sent him a bunch of resorted packets of feathers and three or four whole bird skins to soln and long did sell some of them long says he did not know any of it wish stolen at the time ch ewin confirms edwin made up stories about where the birds came friom and long never stopped to thing how implausible they were partly because he was blinded by his love of the birds but also probably he was blinded by his infatuation for edwin looking back long says edwin was probably just trying to attract less attention to himself my assumption is just he wanted to e rase his traces but the trace is all otete thes s i i do not know why but es usin you as a friend lik es ye se li it is not it is not a nice thing now i it is absolute not ot a had at tough decision about how to deal this friendship at that time i think when when he get exposed i i was sreety shoked am i was frozen from the for him because people they assume that i was than that the one responsible for everything os yem considering if i should turn my back because it is reasonable for me to to erase this friendship an e you cannot do this to frience it made me witreally upset with edwin i do not know how you look at this chain of evence a an see them as equals a i doftknow how you look at the chain of events and see this as any thing other than edwin using him as a fence to potentially take the fall for him if things gan harry sitding with long kirk ultimately turng to the question of where the missing birds were but instead of just asking him outright he used in to the subject who that kind of columbo just one more question gentle persistence meanwhile long sometimes sounded a disgrace to bankg er at a congressional hearing saying he could not remem ber things that seemed thay said for instance kirk asked him whether the customers paid edwin directly or if long had handled any of the money i i do not remember if i received the money or if the money went to him but you mi right i y a lin on a a cany ta way i remember people age thing were sellin for thouand holars ye i you do note te you remember do not think i sall things for thousand of dollars a what i remember most is sselling mall amounts a packages o feathers i on be rude but li er not wi wi i relegous yi understand because i spent for yers to try to forget all this yet ye what are you doings try to be up all in the surface an sa that the details is quite uncare to man myself because i i trying to close this case ye kirk thought to himself you wand me both buddy yeare till la i servis yo ike a wi now en i do not have in the skins i many people roblo think that i possess thos kins why because i was close to related to edvan that would be a natural think to assum it woul be very logical y reasonable or teto think that o ye i yet's that is what i'm saying ye es that is not true ten e ye how can me prove the that not true i cannot i can prof it you can reo cant cant where you think in question bes where i do not know how is ta ha i dyou not know any you n it i i know what is ed i do not know where becaus tiny part was sold throu me you cannot os for a receipt fror mend don mtaving skints krk left long's apartment feeling bad for him but also frustrater and still seemed maybe he was holding something back and he did not know if he would ever see long again but then the next morning long was waiting for kirk in the lobby of his hotel he told kirk he had been thinking and decided to quit tying flies with exotic bird feathers he was afraid though that he would lose the few friends he still had he said the only liked him because he tied beautiful flies kirk and long spent the next two days hanging oun they walked around the city together mostly sight seeing that one point they met up on the steps of the national gallery where monks painting the scream was stolen in nineteen ninetyfor by thieves who broke through a window and i just decided i screw it i'm just gan a i'm going to just do one more attack on his defences here and see if i can get him to admit anything i heard for two separate people that in the last year you have told them that you have much indian crow and you do not you do not have any neat for it and han what of mi fus to do with that wyi you yo lhat you but is it true yo that you have lot of indian crow no iha i ha to ha o ie jes o i a lo i was o o it long kept those packages he was posed to self for himself after edwin was arrestive he sent back to bird skins but he kept the feathers and i suddenly i lie kay this is anouwert getting somewhere how many and he was just miserable under this line of questioning but he finally westimated that he had between six and eight hundred of these feathers from from edwin lit eight hungred is a lot of fechers y no and he did not have that many any more he had sold half of them again that before he knew they were stolen and kept the rest which he had been tying with ever since he was now down to about a hundred feathers kirk sas long also admitted that the number of birds edwin sent him was more ten or twenty rather than just a few we check this with long and he refutes it in any case kirk finally felt he was closing in on what he been after e tobviously he had no real standing to be asking any his questions or making demands he was not the police he did not work for the museum but he had been on this case doggedly for long i's long you have to show me these things right and he cant have very quietly said yes and then im he started crying and he e start a crine yan he he told me he is never told any one about this that he would not even his family knows about this that that he is never admitted this anyone and i saw some one who was realthe struggling with he is actions and in a way that i had not seen with edwin that im there was now were were no tears in the edwin intervie very o and there was a kind of a he thought it was just as crazy as i did this wold story atted tude not only are you getting a better accounting an there co involvement and the number of birds that were involved but also there is something else that you been looking for which his contrition and ye ye krkan long took the train back to long's apartment were long dipped in and fetched his binder of featherds a stampbut with little pockets they brought at toolocal bar ordered a couple of bears and opened it thos ganly tik pictures ss i will not i esk you the just what is what conor and four years after he had first heard about the highest kirk had them in his hands feathers that no one else knew about that edwin wrist had stolen from the train museum it was the first time he had seen stolen train museum feathers in the wild fugitive feathers krk says holding that binder a felt a straight line back to all us whallis who wrote all living things were not made for man again still whillist probably never pictured two guys poring over the detached feathers of his birds in a bar in suburban oslow this is om these ar train and this es jus this is train this is not trin ku this is train and these arcases ju to jus con only the train firs and et i tell eabot a ryether be great ye on throug tees sand t i just remember very clearly having two thhots one was here they are i found them an how can you tell quickly which oer wir witcateer a youare forty there forty or one and an at the same time recognizing just how pathatic it all was and how small it all was there warn't there was not a box of missing birds there were no labels these things i knew what would happen there there just plucked harvested feathers from hundred and fifty year old birds that will never tbe returned to their if you cannot reattached on to a bird you cannot do anything with them en and it was is complicated moment where i was really kind of proud but also a little embarrassed because i was this is not there is nothing really triumphant about this moment kirk told long he thought long should send the feathers back to the museum pardly because it might help long put the whole ugly business behind him long agreed it took him a few months but he finally stuffed them all into an envelope with no return address kirk learned of two other full bird skins that definitively came from the train the buyer lives in south africa and his now interest and sundy bak about twenty others belonging to a guynd much re all ike possible train birs ut we sold them alrity and sthey long sol tand more of them that would bring the total number of birds on accounted for down the thirty two ich means e there is just no way to find out whatd happened to all of the many more and be edwin is not the only fly tire in the world who felt oqet about knowingly owning stole an property anyone who bought anything from him should send it back to the museum in whatever shape is it but what would com of them sending back parts of birds or feathers or whatever young nothe no scientific value and me may be in a some one will figure out down a line howted fe figure out which feather came from which bird but it would just be a a moral victory honestly he moral victory ye i mean it is not ther and i'm fully aware of that the no can o be used but they do not belong to this to this community they belong to that museum and and the end of this should be everyone just return thing gs that they know our stolen even if it is two feathers and they can walk around with their head a little bit higher and mabe as jus stupid of me for is suggesting this but if the choice is between them returning it and them getting to keep it that seems easy to me but kirk finally decided to let go of this case he realized that he had become just as obsessive as edwin about ts brds and as obsessive as wallace for that matter all three men for completely different reasons spent years fixating over the very same birds not the same species the same physical animals wallace wanted knowledge edwin sa a lot of beautiful collers and gestaller signs an kirk though he knows how loony this sounds wanted to avenge the birds as a last stitch effort and with the museum's knowledge he went on the main flytime for em and said that the traing was ready to accept any anonymous returns no questions asked he said as much as i would personally to know who might be in possession of any of the missic skins it is much more important that they be returns and i have included the museums address below for any one who is incline i do not mean to lecture and i magin that some of you might be annoyd by this poin but i am challenging you to help remove this cloud that hangs over your hoby simply to leading any reference to what happeneded the trains does not eem the best way of comin the turnts with it and then more than forty members of the flytime community asked the moderator of the for iim to do the kirk's post and many other things in the story at

the shows sponser back spresy pien the sam to stand up against bictect protector dated expressy piansi coms flesh men last night's fourth republican debate will likely end up as a footnote in presidential history donal trump wos leading the race by leapson bounds was not on the stage thet debate aired on new's nation rather than fox news of the viewership is likely to be a lot lower than the prior it debates but in some ways the debate was by far the most interesting debate of the race is interesting for a few reasons first it showed that governants actually matters the battle between rondo santis in nicky haley where the topto candidates fighting for a distant second place behind trump is a battle over policy positions sure thet debate expose serious differences of position on social issues for example were in haley has posed as more moderate and to santis is more conservative but the sant's main advantage against haley an advantishe dull would carry him further than it has in the pulling far is that he can point at his accomplishments and contrast them with the empty words of his oponents in the normal world the santis would be running away with this nomination the santis is by far the most conservative candidate who can win on the stage has a record of victory in florida ther four candidates on the stage last night rondisantis nicky haly chrisschristy and for some od reason to va com flommy who is still in the race but te santis is by far the most classically conservative person on the stage here for example was rondo santis talking about calvin coolage howas ron the rigans favorite president i ragand watchton lincoln excellent a one of the guides all paccans prictur from his calvin coolage e people dont talk about imothe you presidents that got almost everything right he understood the proper roll the federal government under the constitution we need to restore the us constitution as the center piece of our national life and that requires of president who understands the original understanding of the constitution who has ta good sense of the bill of rit and who knows how we have gone off track with this massive fourth branch of government a this adminis strate of state which is imposing its will on us and is being weaponized against us silent cow knew the proper roll the federal government the country was in great shate when when he was president the united state we can arearn a a learn a loftful lot from calvin coolage welgen that is pretty soudlicanseveiv stuff but the mean to frenchating point for to santis firstis for example haley is over their actual government style last night the question of transgenders using particular bathrums came up nicky haley suggested that the santis was soft on the issue and to santis pounded er on it and ni shows how hypocretical rhine continueus to be when he wents running from governor and they aft him about that he can heidn thank thatran bill for our goudgines of his time you can go look that out i signed a bathroom bill and floridas noting me i can te tu in fay i wun ungan atidand you killed it i find it i he over little girls you did not do it and there was this going on i was actually just in south carolina some of the lege slaters calld me at the time there were boys going into the girl that is the whohi an whythe they say when she does that explanation that that does not hold water this is the up state of south carolim i time the bill i proten no and that obviously is a strong to ferentiating point for to santis and again he thought that that was going to be the main part of this campaign was that even the stuff that trump has talked about doing to sanc is actually done in the state of florida however this brings us to the second point second the debate showed that down trump is still the dominant force on the right that is because of all the stocked up good will he has from his tenure as twenty sixteen candidate beating hilry clenton and is president wher he is pretty conservative and because his one true point of electoral vulnerability trumps point of electorol vulnerability is the fack that ye ardy lost to joobidon in twenty twenty but that has now been obscured both by the media's election malpheasanse in twenty twenty the fact that for example the hunter by the labtop story was covered up the fact that all the voting rules were changed by the democrats in lead up to the twenty twenty election the fact that we had a twenty million votes spike in the number of votes beteen twenty sixteen and twenty twenty and mostly by jobidon's awful pole numbers right now if the argument is that trump is unelectable then the real clerpoltic pulling average which puts trump i had of bidon right now is very difficult to overcome that is why attacts from ronto santis against trump pell flat here is to santis going after trump last night buck he he is shoe father time is undefeated the idea that were gon o put some one up tor that tal must eighty an there is going to be no a facts from that we all know that that is not true ah and we have an opportunity to do a next generation of leaders and really be able to mov mo this cora wealcity to presen that can serve two terms ah i do not think donald trom bote as nt hav idn te geen bee bible o get electod the demo crats want him to be the nominy we see that they are ging to turn the screws the minute if he got the notan t tin ere g s it now to santis happens to be correct democrats still believe the trump is the most beuble nominy for the republicans no matter what the poles say the problem is when the poles have trump up on bidon as they do right now when donal trump is in the best pulling position of his career actually better than any time in twenty sixteen better than any time in twenty twenty the elec toral argument is a hard case to make in one second well get to the third point that we take away frum the debate first purtock has he covered for the holidays to the free moto

qualifine plan to day oket and this leaves us to the third point of the debate there is no reservoir of anger at trump among republicans the santus was trying to go after trump on the basis that trump is too old or that he cannot win the problem is that trump is running against a person who is even older and right now he is leaving the boles but the other attack on trump which is that he would be quotin qu unfit for the presidency is something republicans do not believe there is no reservoir of anger at trump over his eratic and often awful behavior itself only if that behaviour threatens toral viability to re publicans become queezy republicans have essentially decided i think rightly given the nature of to day's politics that we are well beyond questions of civility many of us have decided tht if the most plausible candidate happens to be the guy who tweats dum stuff and makes jokes about becoming a dictator jokes by the way there really underscore the fact that every single president since borokobama has use executive power indictatorial fashion we do not really care we may not the stuff the donal trump did between november and ganuary of twenty twenty one but if the alternative is jobidon using his own dictatorial power to say make osho cram a vax down on eighty million people or jobidon using dictatorial power to essentially keep the border open well we will pick our own giant pulsitting midle finger thank very much that means that cris christy's attacks on trump which is that trump is onfit for the presidency those fell flap republicans our treating donal trump generic republican and weardly aure democrats at this point when christy attack to santis and said why do not you answer whether trump its fitter not desansis smart enough not to play the game the santus knows that if he says that trump is unfit all of trumps voters do not to santis then but whale christy is attempting to do is point out i think correctly that the republican party longas that things trumpisfit is likely nominate trump that is true here is cristy why is e just the oe quess the question was very tirect is he tit to be presenent wor is not he the rest of the sfeech is interesty but conpletely non re spons an we r quirt room thi strite the an sr sin tovne te santi othe ra t stin a smar weian ta taothey wa othey wa ey wur a ike the an to they wan to o ater is e o lin you o yo o o thi i ing no o i thi ly do the thing is te te otte do o ie our ote n to e tye th a e iii i i fi i o i te an ti i e i l o an i i a o o ea i i a o o o o o a ti e i to o oma conti look father time is undefeated i do not know how he would score on it on a task but i know this we havenan opportunity to nominate someone and eleck someone for two terms who is going to be spitting nails on day one in for eight years te wen he ti aris all we wesha not ominate somebody a wong as te wo to whos olemust eighty years all hea's a frad and comow cristy is right that do sansis will not answer he is corrected to sans toon anser why hes republicans do not think the trumps onthit period and of story when cristy says things there afraid to talk about valdemor it just underscores the fact that cristy is running a revenge campaign me let' t be real about this the problem is that cristy i's not a vible alternative to trumpsof he is going to attack trump this way then heu start looking at cristy well there is one problem that is i can wash here as risty doing his let us attack trumpertin look magon i'm it is often very difficult to be the only person on the stage whos telling the truth and the only person who is taking on would needs to be taken on i look in my watch now were seventeen minutes since this to be and except for your little speech in the beginning we have hat these three acting as if the race is between the four of us the fifth guy who does not have the guts to show up and stand here he is the one who has you just put it his way head in the poles and yet i've got these three guides who ere all seemingly to compe i'm with youovaultemore heu shall not be names they do not want a talk about i now again cristy is right that he is the only person who is willing to really go after trump but there is a promblem he boolege trump in twenty sixteen he ended ap working for him do not youremember the vedeal of trum saying him crist go get on the plane and here is the other problem cristy's not an alternative to trump on policy here he was last night for example on sexual mutilations are tury for miners how is it that you think a parent shou be able to ocavis surgeryis never mind the sterilization of a child and are not you way to out a step on this issue to be the republican omeny no not because out brigis republicans believe in less government ot more in lesson voblem with government not more government evoin people's ives and your magan i trust parents and we are out theret saying that we should in power parents an education we shuldn't power parents to make more decisions about where ther cins good school i agree we should 't power parets to be teaching the values that they believe in in their homes without the government telling them what those values should be and yet we want to take other prantal rights away i'm sorry as a father of fore i believe there is no one who loves my children more than the o gay that is true no one loves your children more than you but also there ares there are things called child to be hoose and if you love your kin but you smack your kiden ahead with a brick every day well that is a wegal hiding onfor his genitals should be as well fourh the ebate showed that these campaigns unfortunately have become opportunites for additional exposure for the marginal candidates and the best way to exploit that opportunity is to run directly toward twitter slash ax and as the pol show ex is not real life now listen i personally know three the for candidates on stage ofve never ment cristy i kow rondtosantus he is a straight forwardly good guy his wife is delight realianize family i know nickey whos personally again a delightful human being i know her kids as well and i know avake iell

have learned from these debates again is that these debates can be an excellent platform for be coming more famous and that is favake agan i know tavake i supernize guy brilliants incredibly personable really charming glib is hell i' say he is a salesman's salesman which is how e made his money right he was essentially the guy who is fund raising for a publicly traded farmasuitacle company that is fine that is totally cool he is also commilionic he has been throughout the race he is been trying to play trumps game save the unsable except that things he sayng are less unsable now because trump has been in the game saying those things for a long time now the problem is as the realm of the unsable decreases that means the'v avake has to chase the realm of the unsaable he used to be unsaable to say that boys ar not girls and then trum sed it a lot n then we ell sed e a lot n at's non unsable any more we make full movies about ite and that means the realm of the unsable is shrinking into the more and more marginal viewpoints and sof avake if yo wants to keep up with the unsable candidate thing yes to chase the realm of the unsable and that is what he has been doing last night here is one of his listicls of unsable ideas he does these un twitter by the way e'll just sweet out seven unsable ideas six of which are cen o rote inside the republican party and one of which is usually ill but odd here he was last night it is all three of them have been lic king gonal trum foots for years for lot and n our sron the santis ofve ben a great governor but you would have never been one without act to begging donal trump for that indor an you at sathi ir a yera go santhin is cristy as a lobbies begging them for a cove mody for his special interest in new jersy prepping him for the debates last time around these people are not mondi worning quarter backing some decision he mad i that the real enemy is not donal trump it is not even jobitan it is the deep state that at least donal trump a tem ed to take on and if you want somebody who is ging to spek truth to power that vote for somebody who is going to speak the truth to you why mi the only person one the stage at least who can say that january six now goes look it was an inside job that the government li to a tor t er a a a n non aleven that the great replacemen theory is not some grand rike wing conspiracy theory but a basic statement of the demo cratic pardy's platform that the twenty twenty election was indeed stolen by big teck that the twenty sixteen o lection the one that that trump one for sure was also one that was stolen from him by the national securitious tashment a can at ctan cout the trump rushia collusion hokes tha than het was false there is e reason why on the only persan o there to get a an things that is what it is going to take not people were licking his brutes one time and now whai manit quarter back im a criticizing when it is convenient i sang antable saying tanto except that alon that stu is not really unsaable ow when you say that the twenty sixceen election the results were thwarted by the called epstate premuch ever republican believes that it i literally all of us believed that the russian hoks was a hoax promulgated by people inside the federal government whoare promulgating false information the twenty twenty election was stolen by bigteck if by that he means the big tec put its thum on thi s gils for trobidn we all believe that tht's obviously true that is not saying tuntable literally everyone on stage we will say that however what he will do the ten' put all of that in a sandwich with january six was an inside job i'm not sure what he means by ganury six was an inside job does he mean that somehow the trump administration which was in power at the time worked with the protestors does he mean that it was nancy polosy working with the protestors who are coming into the capital building does it does he just mean that the re police officers who opened the doors which obviously is true after the rites were already in progress january six was not that on of what inside job in the sense that no one committed criminal activity it is true the prosecution of some of e people whowere in the capital is clearly excessive but inside job when he says that the government whytoss for years about nine eleven what he means is that one of the people who house ninal of an highjackers was a member of the souty intelligent service an hat was revealed in report in twenty twenty one but he is beeng labroader claim than that when he says that the great replacemen theory is real that is a term withs somantic overload because it has been used by wates who premisis as a bus word for a placemen of wites by minorities including jews and specifically jews cr afting this entirer system in order to replace white people that is what people were chanting atd for example charlosfill in the sa jews will not replace us thon't riet about the invasion of hundreds of millions of jews the are suggesting the jews were presiding over the system of immogration but it is true that the democratic party has talked for twenty years about the changing demographics of the contry facilitating an permanent democratic electoral majority vavague wants to win points for audacity but let us be real he is really not saying anything the tunker carlson has not been saying better for longer in reality of avakue lek trump needs in opponents in a vacuum a lot of his view points do not make all that much sense he is been on most sides of wide ride of issues but that also geves him theway to fire at all the candidates from every other side of every other issue last night avakes target was mainly nickey haly whom he proceeds as his candidate of differentiation tbecause she is the quinquomain stream candidate a distants is popular the basenickey haily is not nearly is popular with the base vavakue was can go after her using te same angle trump himself used in twenty sixteen against the called interventionists in the republican party now ther'rea few problems with this the biggest problem is that the right has always been divided between hawks and isolationists going back tu george h w bush at verses for exampl papyu cannon and before that charles linburg fersts the rest of the republican party in the pre world ware two ero the isolatinists on the right generally had their way in the post world ware to ero the hawks had their way on the right in the aftermath of the aroc war it is an open question who wins this battle but as the world grows more dangeris isolationists tentactually loozse sway the most obvious line of attack for ra publicans against jobidan on foreign policy for example is not that he is two interventionist it is that he is weak that he is wafling that he' surrenderis an afganistan tha he sends mixed signals that our enemies can see all of that and they are taking advantage well get to the foreign policy issues there being raised by vak in just one second caus thei'r kind of fascinating first as a daily war listener you are not just in formd you are engaged value freedomen personal responsibility and this is why you need to check out medishare medishreis a community based approachd to halth care that lines up with the principles you actually believe in your valus matter noth medishare your health car dollars will not be used for medical procedures that do not line up with your belies meishareis the highestrated health care sharing ministry with a thirty year proven track record it is not health insurancs it is a community of four hundred thousand believers comitted to carring and sharing with one another members have up to fifty per cent or more on their monthly healthcar cost member satisfaction surveys show they medishare much more than their own health insurance why wel because meishr actually works for limited time tayly ar listeners will receive one hundred fifty dollar gif card when they join medishare to find out more go to medishare dot com slash ben as medishare dot com slash ben terms and conditions do apply go check him out right now medishare dot com slash ben and again this helps you not only get great medical coverage by your health car dolars or not can to be used for medical procedures that you have moral objections to go check him out right now medishare dot com slash ben hases when it comes tof foregn policy vevague lunch to bunch of attacks on nickey hayley last night those attacks are generally from the isolationist right wit ch is very similar to the isolationist left the problem is that does not really line up with the republican perspective rit large on jobide jobiden is weak i's not the jobidon is too muscular in form policy is that he is too weak even in eu crane the problem for bidon is tht he refose to choose in actual line either you have to give you crane weapon re necessary to actually smash russia in the don bassan crimia or you have to to find an offramp an pursue it bidon choyce as always hi's neither that is always his choyce is what if i just ou kow sit here and be a vegetrable but when it comes to israel the attack on bidin is not that he is too pro israel from the right is that he enabled te rhon dealisted th who thess the terristorganization fosterd more funding for the palistonian authority and u an our w way which means commoss and now is trying to handcuff israel in it is ability to finish off a genecidal antie jewish terris group when vavak for example attacks nickey haly for being too pro israel that generally does not go over that well with the crowd that is not on acts here he was last night doing just that what happened to israel was deadwrong what hamas did was midieval it was somhuman it was immoral and we have to call that out for what it is an october seven but to say that that was an attack on america fails the basic tefts that may nick if ye cannot tell the difference betwen whore israel is not te uesses on a map i can have my three year old son show you the difference now that is a silly argument obviously israel is not in america and the interest of the united states are not always the interest of israel anvice versa but suggesting that haley hold some sort of duel loyalty is assenin and the craw ne which is why that attack fell flad even if the feverswamps of acts sure on this sort of silly postering likewise the intrnet chered vavak quizzing nicky haley on the provinces of the donbas region in ou crane the people on action ar this ends nicky haly here was vevak doing this retine i want to say one thing about the cid oise experience is not the same as foreign policy wisdom i want everybody at home to know that i was the first person to say we need a reasonable pe stealin ou cran now a lot of the neo cons are quiet thy coming along to that position with the exceptioncs of niy haly and jobidon who still support this what i believe is pointless war in ou cran and i think ghos that forn police experience one thing that jobidon and nikihaliav an common is that neither of them could even state for you three province says in easterng you crane that they want to send our troops to actually fight for look at thatthis is that i want people to understand these people have i'm she has no idea what the hell the names of those provinces are but you wants to send our sons and daughters an our trim and our military equipment to go fightit t reject this smit that they have been selling you that somebody had a copicoffi stint at the uan and tha makes eight million bucks after has real forn polican experience it takes an outsider to see this through look at the blank expression ceee that tocouple of things to note about vava s point here one nickey has never called for putting troops into you crane no republican candidate has lizerally zero of them in fact haley's entire point is that you fund you craine is you do not have to put troops intyou crane or any of the surrounding countries that presumably be threatened if frusha were to take kee yoe's completely mis stating her position to suggest the sort of isolationist notion that we are going to send american boys and girls over to dive for terri toryes far away she is not suggested that no one has suggested that but it is worth noting that haley did not fact after this name two of the three province is correctly after the question she said crimia instead of harkeeve she said tonatsk anluhansk shere is the reality most americans dont now the answer to this particular question that lack of knowledge is not actually dispositive is to what american action should look in any particular region is a very tried and true attackline and it does not tend to score a lot of points in the real world why because geography be quizzes are a quick an easy way for isolationists to score a really cheap an easy point quick name all the provinces ese china you cannot and how can you criticized china over it is cove nineteen policies or opposang invasion of ti jan can you name every province in all of china but these sorts of attackstone actually wor in nineteen ninety nine george doby bush was asked by reporter to name the leaders of tiwone india packstan in chechnea he responded can you name the foreign minister of mexico push one the election americans do not need you to be and encyclopedia they needed to make the right decision when you are pressed and that decision comes from baseline world view not quick search of the gougl machine that is what trump became presinent to think trum couldn' name ten other countries off the top of his ead outside of europe but being right is not the point of a vakes campaign it is oppositionality that is literally awhole point of the campaign that is why he went hardet haley not just on policy but personally in the most conspiratorial of ways by the way he accused her of bad faith of fashism of fakery whos pretty ugly here is avake comparing nikey haley to commal harris i don' question her fav but i question her ofthentis and i think that is deeper yere we were just talking about the transissue this is a symptom of a deeper cant ser in american life identity politics this new religion that says your race your gender in your sexuality are your identity it is anty american it is meritocratic it is anty martocratic and it is dividing this country to a breaking point and i've spoken about this to the left by books are all about this i've creac this to the left but it is even worst when republicans trie to play the same game wer talking about that transisue an nickeyhaley's campaign lonch vino sounded a woke billing malvani buliht ad talking about how she would kick in oveel at the first t bay she say that only a woman can get this job don that is what she said after the third debat when i criticized ronomac daniel after five failedears of leadership of this party and criticized nickey for er corrup foreign dealings as a military contractor she said that i have a woman problem nicky i do not have a woman problem you have a corruption problem and i think that that is what people needo know nickey is corrupt this i e i i p o ta eline pares o n t a a o po asters wielding e po e i a youe to i cis is out this gameis play the popit master's foot up their popet and i reject the use of identity politics in this farty it as been a cancer coming from the left and sickent out of the double standards the people of this country or to having two ex tromizones does not in a i a a s a aitin ther an havn haling wic t yoras fine now are not tans not marth my time teveris find a him you mean she happens to be right about that i'm sorry when you hold up tae jimpie's paper that just as nicky equals corrupt you look a child yulok an idiot it is ridiculous it is riculous again then the notion then nicky haly's views a somehow magically change because after she left to office she lworked with bowing it is it is silly that is suggesting that the varomasuamy's views have change because he once worked with big farma had made all his money off a bid farma mean it that it is a dumb atackline it is a really dummattacklin that was not his dummist attack line of the ight he actually then attacknickyhaly as a quoticuol fasius why is nickyhaley a fashes cause she discreesed them on forn policy here is nicky haley was keeping praise on me when i wrote that book but now i worry i was warning about the woke industrial complex in this country as a warning apparently she read it as a how too manual iarator to o o ta ta i far more dangerous than out this really porfical understand we are marching towards fachosm under biden jack smith ais not peen every last re tweet that someone has issued from donald trump in the year twenty twenty the only person more fahious than the bidin regime now is nicky haley who thinks that government should identify i ta i de that is not freedom that is fachism she is wrong on the social media issue in ananimity but saying that she is a fasiist more fasious than jobidon e's silly was in vavake is not running for president he wras really never running for president he has not ben running for presene in this hold tine he is coronly pulling les than five per cent nationally he is not breaking ten per cent any state but he is capturing the hearts of people you need to wanth toa podcast or perhaps a sentent primary run he is also single handily make can chris christy look at least somewhat entertaining in amusing here is hristian fo vake last night u you ton th a ary to ba you go out in the stopin you say something all us see it on for the o we con frunt you one the bate stage you say you did not say it and then you back away and i wont say was at n im no a on yet what this elo os to ba the fourth debate that you wuld be voted in the first twenty minutes as the most ob noxious below harden america a i b a a a o say something else wern ou twenty five minutes tit tis to ba and he has insulted nicky halis basic intelligence not her positience her bsic intelligence she oesn't no reagon she would not be able to find something on a map that his three year old could fine look if you wanted disagree anisies that is fine and nickey and i disagree on summissions but i'll tell you this i'd knowner for swelve years which is longer than he is even start o votin a republican fri we disagree about to misisan we disagree about who should be pressh united states whell we do not disagree on is this is a smart a coplissed woman you should stop an sult tit ot i gt by the way crist not wrong that i again wwhat is made e my tres cristy is that yetshe does have a lot of nate political talen which is way he became governor of new jersey he then misused it n blew it in every single way that was not the extends of cristy lang into the vague last night after the mate he also hit into the vakue in the post debate spin room i think the vate does have a woman probe i do think he insalts women's basic intelligence he is done over and over and over again and i guess to night i just at had enough i had enough wo listning his carbage and as i said his smart as harvard mouth cause that is what it is when he is dictated to me in the keal you hafe committed ourselves to public service why he is been off stealing from seniors to make his fortune tein i o put up with him any more here is the thing ax twitter is not real life and trumpitsham is not really in ideology

about last night's debate it showed that the gap between winning a primary campaign and winnig a general election is indeed very real for republicans by pulling data nicky hayley is the republican best position against jobidon to santis leads biden by one in the real clarpolitic pulling average donal trump is up on bidon by couple points in the rel clarpolitics pulling average nicky hayley leads jobiden by five in the real clar politics pulling average and somepoles she is up by his much as ten points but aside from form policy where hayley is a hawk's talk her positions are in fact moderate across the board from abortion to gendersurgery for miners here she was last night walking back her stated position on gender surgery for the under age she said yesterday as we played on the show that should be a question for parencs her she was trying to walk that back last night she said the wall should not get in balled than that and i just ask you if you are somebody that is going to be the presiden the united states and you cannot stand up against child abuse how are you gong to be able to hidn had our franading that is the true min matters we have it on vivio i fad i fad that if you have to be eighteen to get attack to you should have to be eighteento have anythan don to chanes that er gaish ok but that moderate position that she laid out yesterday is not a position the republican's becaus not a good position the republican primary electorit is not in the mood for moderation you have to be either militant in policy or in affect which is again why trump who is a moderate i'm any of the same policyes ironically on which hayley is is way out in frunt he might be closer to haily on policy than he is even to disantis but his affect is always militan's unless be frank about this the republican base is hissed off meanwhile jobidon is betting the republican anger will back fire on republicans the same way that it did in twenty twenty it is not a bad bet by the way because when you look at whats happening in congress republican militan's may lose them the house majority without even another election taking place last night cave mc carthy the former speaker of the house was ousted by mat gates in company for literally no reason might johnson has nowrw place mac carthy and t ehouse is running in exactly the same way that was when mc carthy was the speaker of the house nothing his change it was merely a petty rudge match between mc carthy and gates in which gates decided to depose mac carthy n mc cars that you not i've had enough of this and he is leaving he announced yesterday that at the end of his term he was going to laves as no matter the odds or personal costwe tod the right thing is what he wrote n the lastry journal it is in the spirit i've decided to depart the house at the end of this year to serve america in new ways i know my work is only getting started there is one problem for re publicans they just ouste jeorge santos who is a fraud stir that jus ousted him from congress and that seat will likely go democrap cemc carthy seat is can be up for special election republicans currently hold two hundred twenty one seats to republicans two hundred two democrats two hundred and thirteen that means they can afford three defections on party line votes with stancit with santos out and mc carthy leaving by the end of the year well that means that the buffer dwindles to two votes at's early as mid february that means that the republican majority in the house is now two votes large s they better hope nobody dies no be has a scheing accident cevan hearna of oklahoma chare of the epublican sudd committe he said an embolden some individuals at any given time with the specific issue to to hold up in stop the entire process margery tale agreeng who has emerged as in actual republican who once to get things donch as that think he makes everything harder that is everything from appropriations bills to impeachments surpassing anything on the house floor again he was ousted for no reason and mc carthys i've had it and i'm out and you'r seeng a lot of republicans who feel this way what is what' tilerious is the democrats are looking at the upcoming election many of them areretiring many many more democrats are retiring in twenty twenty four then republicans leaving those seasopen but democrats aur leaving because they see that jobidan is a weak candidate republicans are leaving h becauethey are tired of each oth and the're annoyed by the false purity test that they are engaging upon with each other leaves o republicans to steal defeat from the draws victory that is one thing they are good at and democrats are counting on them to do that again that is precisely at trobidn is counting on to yesterday he was giving a speech the president and he said i'm not the only person who can be trun but i will defit him that is following up on his comments t literall the only reason he is running is cause he thinks trump his tdenominate oll we i o i l by door closes in yes to go to the bathomr something o jimasina as one of his campaign managers he says we cannot take chances on anyone else except for jobidon again democrats are justbetting that donal trump his toxic enough that he will lose the election and ot betting the bins gon a win it they are betting the bit that that that donal trump is going to lose it youre is mecine a yesterday yowas not ogbening the door jo bide was ging o gear nomany an there is lots people you and i bok nowin to whoad love to ron o thot office but the truth is the oimproven and wit jonal trump we know that jo bidon has bee him the first time he will be in the second time and we cannot take the risk of an unknown candidate the these fokes sometimes just arready for primetime as we saw with ser palon with dan quail with a whole bonch o think you sen right now with the santus who is everyone is boly who national candidate an the spot likt which is too great deal trumpedmitted last nigme in year the you will be a dictator on gay one we just cannot take a risk for that and that is whay jo bytn werean the first time and is woys running thi second time whell he ran a basement campaign last time at n't a bunch factors in his favor including a vast up takan absence he voting that is not going tor be repeated this time around and again the left is relying on republicans basically running to rectly had long its whalt the not horrible bet republicans jump on rakes on routine basis there basicly that side cho bob clip from the simpsons wore he walks on every rake that is republicans but is that a smart bet by democrats again the way they thin the'e ging to run against tonal trump is by claiming that he is a fashist an a criminal here is morning joe doing the fashist routine all the ritling media has done they have gottn as sinehat that had ctroblems with crak they have chase ou avrydly they could chase tou they make fools of themselves time and tie agin but get has work there lyin about the corrupt bin fat the family they lat g that clarence tomas ais wine talking about the bn cing family should be on barn is outside and get mout repeating this line this fashos a tap this fashos line over and over and over agan you look at the pouls it is work now mut half of american see jo biin his corrut it is donal trop when of course it is such ot we can wistet for four hours it is such a for posterous argument and yet becaus fashis or gode at propaganda it is ashy work heep saying it overanoter sogiscp saint fashist over and over and over that is can wenne the election i have serious serious doubts that that is in fact the case in the reality is that as i've said man comes before everything is baked into the cake with regarded tfrump the only question is whether a criminal con viction is baked in to the cake that is literally the only question left in the election cycle if donal trump is criminally con victed which he likely will be in washington ye see not because he is guilty of the crimes ledge wbut because to washington de se jury if that happens does that change the pull numbers in tany market or serious way or everyone already can vassooms that that is the way that it is going to go jobidon was that default candidate in twenty twenty to day because bidon is really bad at this trump is that hefault candidate and that is a serious problem for jobidon and al t people shrieking fahis from the from the top of the of the empire stay building it is not going to work o cane just one second wo gets the

we will give your funning for you crane even toughwe do not it if you give us som bore security tand jobidon is just fighting this thing tooth and nail he believes that he has a winnin g proposition wth the american people by segesting that republicans are out of touch on you crane because they want some sort of all fram in you crane that if that if jobidon screams freedom over and over without any plan that is somehow ong to make everything i'll better that is not going to work here is jobidin yesterday again the deal is in front of him the deals in front of him republicans in the senate have said bore security plus funning for ti wan pluss funning for israel pluss funning for you crane and we will do it and jobidon is threatening to vito that he is he is basically having his democrats in the senate lock that bill nd thenhes going to triand and ram through he is own naked you crane funding vehicle presumably without wor security anything that is a winning proposition for americans for some reason i do not understand it here is jobiden trying to chame republicans make no mistake to days os cony lon remder the tis hes going to judge harshly thos o curn back co creetens

senser for strtegican international study's vardy spent a hundred and thirteen billion dollars in you crane and he is provided no offrempagant bidon's position is always shout broud slogan without any plan i'm not sure how thi s gin to work biden's accusing republicans to playing chicken with national security while he is playing chicken with national security here he was yesterday stran re publicas a clan chicken with o nasti securi holin cran funnyn hospyson excreme partis border pos really they are plang chicken while why whis bor security and exstreme policy thei're democrats who backit sentr lank for o of o glohoma he says well i mean what we wants for the ofice wo oud likes him bor security why is the difficult there is a must pass bill coming and i believe in the senate it is got funning for isreal funning for you craning funding for border security a i hope that pass is an i hope in the house they had a rider cutting off all the funds that god of these ihe universithese are engage min i senatism whare is that bill right now senator and whats senite e e i ra now oy ap e littl funnyn bil is no money at i be a help you crane i real working at e sen ey can also border funding we are actually in the tenit going to stop that bill from living throughbing of the governoon border polo te issues having more money to the border to o sol a wo people cropsing the border fafter we did not actuo change of direction on that sente r pol to clac i o top o that to day and toll say we are glad to bey bll have a vod on that o longas or also solving the issue at or sother border mean again is a pretty obvious wind fromiding he gets pretty much what he wants and then he also gets to say the va silitated border securities s i do notreally see the ration ow other than he has an ideological commitment to some form of open borders which is why he still has alahangor maorcas the secretary of homeland security which again is ridiculous ance he is not guaranteeing the secured of the home landin any way shape or form suggesting the yorbie is tat hour doing an amazing job on emigration let me make this perfectly clear the emigration sistem is been broken for decates in our department of homeland security has been underfunded for years and years and president biden has address both issues a with strength from day one on the first day of his administration he presented congress with legislation to fix our emigration system and we have submitted to congress a supplemental funding bill that will resource our department the heroic border patrol agents a that you display just a few minutes ago a to fun them as they need to address what is an unprecedented level of migration not only at our southern border not only in the western hemisphere but throughout the world republicans are objecting to the fact that what meorcas and abide mant is more money on the border to facilitate faster entering not to actually close the border not to change bor policy they want more agents to wave people through that is the idea here meanwhile mayorchas is expending his political capital suggesting that the governor of texes he is doig something deoply wrong by shuttling migrans from taxis to place chicago new york again it is very hilarious the democrats continue to maintain that is horrible for illegal emigrans to go to major american cities that are dominated by democrats that basically there bore policy has to only a fact red states is mazing with with respect to governor prister with whom a i communicate a unirregular basist a we have provided him with tremendous assystence not just financially through our shelter in services program funding that the president achieved but also in providing technical advice but lets let us get to the rud of what governor pristers a challenge as is that we have another governor in another state that is not cooperating in cordinating with either federal or other local authorities and his unilaterally sending migrants two cities a in of what i think is an abdication of governments responsibility heyare talking about cragabet i am indeed is abdication of responsibility apparently to ut to send illegal emigrans north whell i mean you gests eure doing it every day but from mexico that is weird sagain jobidon could end all this today bi simply saying ok we will tance or border policies and all then be considered stronger on the bord i'll have a dofence when i'm attacked in a presen entrois but he is attached his left lank they simply cannot do it meanwhile over at the universities of the universities made a big booboo the ay before yesterday the heads of harvard am i te niver si pennsylvania they went to the hill and they just exploded they they the did a horrible job they refuse to say whether it is a violation of school policy to shout genicidal chance against jews and then they had to walk it back this was obvious lhe ridiculousthey mid twenty four forty eight hours the probe that they have they discussed yesterday on the program is that the ideology of ins fro sectionality demands the jews be subjected to chance this because jhews are not part of the introsectional colition jews are cuoncuot white people because they'are part of the power a hierarchy and swen people chance about getting rid of the jews well if they are of the appres people who are shouting that can you really tar get them well this is led to some back tracking from some of these university presients well after the fact claudin gay who is the president of harvar yo put out a statements anquote there are some who have confused o right to free expression with the idea that harvard will con done calls for violence against jewish judents let me be clear calls for violence or genicide against the jewish community ore any religious or ethenic gru barviol they have no place at harvard those who threaten our jewishtudes will be hld to account now again she is out living herselfs some wiggleroom there becauseif you say from the rever to the sea palstine shall be free which i to all for genicide against jews in that region then apparently that is ok or intofada revolution that apparently is o k only if you shout straight up i want to kill that jew would claudin gay get involved nem tthe reality is that these univers y have very strict sbeech coats if i say boys are not girls i might be brought up in front of the acdhemic senate at these universities but suddenly they relying on their freetsbeech principles we point out yesterday it is absolute nonsence the the blowback to these presidents was in fact strong from most sides of the isle even some democrats were going after them representive jake autian closs as while sathmolton both fror mass chusetts they put out a statements ang harverinks last out of two hundred forty eiht universities for support of free speech when it comes to denouncing auntisemitism suddenly th university has anxietiesabout the first menment it rings hollow well yes even the white house when after these university presidents putting out a statement suggesting that thisis ridiculous according to bidon spokes person andrew bates he said quotes unbelievable this needs to be said calls for genicde ar monstrous and antathetical to everything we represent as a country any statemen that advocates for the systematic murder of jews are dangerous and revolting we shoud all stand firmly against them wonly after the left signed in did these presidents at start to backdown there was the university of pennsylvania president who was caught on vidiocano smirking as shos ask this question i she looks quite contrite now because what the she she is blinking in morse code please leave me in my job thats whac she is blinking in morsecoed here there as the moment during yesterday congressional hearing on antisemitisn when i was asked if te call for the genicide of jewish people on our campness would violate our policies in that moment i was fogus on our university's long standing policies alined with the ouask constitution whih say that speech alone is not punishable i was not focused on but i should have been the irresutable fact that i call for geniide of jewish people is it call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate it is evile plain and simple i want to be clear a call for genicide of jewish people is threatening deeply why did they goin tan join ntintein tiit wit th'm sar ats ridiculous here is the reality all these presidents were saying this stuff because they believe this stuff and now they are being forced to bacco off the point becaus their lot do not nis you do not particularly it but they still believe this stuff in fact they were put in these positions because they believe this stuff this was the lipnistus in the first place and again the the stupidity if you wont to see the stupid persons version of this ridiculous argument all yes tid is tun over tothe view wor sunny haston and would by golberg a rushing to the university's defense claiming legal knowledge against sunny hoston as if she is your lawyer man you better get ready for some prison time because she is the world's worst lawyer here sunny haston trying to claim thet legally speaking these presidents are not allowed to take action against judents were calling for anti jewish genicide naturally it is wuld by golber against any howston leading the charge on this one of course of course because woilpby is the same person who said the hitler was not a racist when he went after the jews hos jews were white people and it was white on white violence tagain they believe these stupid people version of what all these presidents believe here they were trying to defend the universities college is the perfect place to have these sorts of uncomfortable conversation even te wish o o o o oi ny on you said that the supreme court cannot prevent spach that is likely to provide a hostl response if ou hild ta tis f any other commandity on earth other than she us i would be canful tentimes to fi a io ti not ben ot as throu because i it is they most tonnoying one of the most anoy things about the costution is that as the stone it fonlo can ot an on watch in somebody put up that news and i'm feel it uncomfortable then not if i a i pla i a a r i toitan store yet and that' different and the law is the low the laws the wawl woul be golbrig and sunny howsted people are ridiculous the lad dos not apply the first amendment standard unfortunately is not the standar an college camps of been bandom colleges for saying some of things that i say this such a li butwick if studen you prt up a noose outside a black students dorm at a major university not only will you be councelled cial you will be expelled from the university we all mow this this is a fact wil be golbrig is a lyar and she stupid to boot out norther she is lying were the she frick an dumb but the fact is that between whil by gulberig and sunny hostin suddenly becoming first amendment to turn hes and they are obvious cross over with the fact that they are kind of on the side of the comas next year and why sht kind of i mean pretty obviously ontside of the omss nex year that is what is happening suddenly tthe same people who hate free speech the minute the minute that they are side is threatened by the standards that they themselves have set suddenly the free speech advocates to mazing truly incredible stuff now aghen if you are 't sad a free speech spandar standard at these schools that anybody can say prettig much anything that we are going to broaden the overton window of behavior to include many more quont wha extreme viewpoints that is fair but you now it is not these are the most restrictive placeis in america in terms of speech codes and suddenly there is only one thing that is a somehow immuine to tese speech codes and that is when you are calling for the extermination of jews in the mdlieast when you are calling for the removal of jews from that entire region ardogites the rest ofthe shows continuing right now you'r noc conone o mis it will be joined on line by

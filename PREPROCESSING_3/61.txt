todashospasserbakpresspepian tou ar web hastory being seen and sold to advertisers now meneither at expressvypian right out expressbypianticam flashmen happy talk is dangerous in politics it is dangerous because it gets people killed it leads people to believe foolish things out of idiotic hopes and fatuous streams leaders tend to believe what they want to believe that is precisely the oposite of their job particularly when it comes to national security forein policy ought to be the preserve of cold eyed men and women capable of making hard but correct decisions unfortunately politics tends to draw people with starry visions or at least cowards will mask their own cowardice with those starry visions it is hard to tell which one pressent bidon is becoming these days as israel's war agains komas continues and make no mistake that war will continue untill komas is utterly destroyed biden seems to be starting to waver he is made many of the rght sounds over the course of the war is expressed support for deposing komas is correctly stated that israel has a difficul task in doing while minimizing civilian casualties yet now prided by a radical left wing legasy media and young dafts staffers he seems to be wavering thus yesterday bid an issued the following tweet quote commas unleisht a terrorist attack because they fear nothing more than is railies an palistinians living side by side in peace to continue down the path of terror violence killing in war is to give comas what they seek we cannot do that what precisely did bidan mean by this swee wile the white house came out to day and they said this was not a change in policy bidonstill wants komasko and but the tweet seems to create it catch twenty two you cannot give homas what they want says jobiden which is supposedly more violence but to destroy comas requires violence 's bidan arguing for leving comas in place in the name of defeating coms or is hes simply setting up a deeply on realistic expectation for any military in the face of a terrorist group that purposefully embeds itself incivilian areas in order to pray on western soff heartedness with regard to civilian casualties either way bidang is harming israel's war effort with such reteric and the west by proxy hes falling victims the propagandistic efforts of the legasymedia which continue to promote for separate foolish claims first the comas is not quite as bad as it seems second that israel is much much worse than it seems third that israel ought to make concessions to the palisinian authority in order to defeat comas and for that bidins electoral prospects reli on believing the first three claims let us go through these in order first the claim the comas is not all that bad gotsay it is astonishing and bewildering and disheartening to watch holicos tonial form in reel time but we are watching it happen that is the only similar phenomenon to what ive seem to what is happening right now holicost denial we are watching an active attempt to rewright komas into some sort of political protest group just a little more passionate this has involved outright lies the li for example tat comas did not kill people at the nova music festival it was hisraely halicopters or obfiscation to have heap of his raily women being raped or merely medical reports of their broken pelices more often is taken the form of down plan comas es evil altogether thus we get eiman malgelten o the an emasan b c claiming that comas is actually a reasonable negotiating partner as shown by the fact than that they are now hostage deals going on is popleomatic amacan as them ti spray work fer dialogu that has allod the last three days a bhere spreed can actually be pro long now peoper mi dis ra some biing tat certainly the copatis believ could av been establish much earlier on in bis conplat when this wor broke out i they had actually show to the american an these railyes that hamas bhase byt what they were say publicly and willing you on the ground with the reliese o t beople american than tit to is raillyes early on they were prepared to entur into this kind of pray work but here we are omust sat an a hawelater and any este can bold that i think no the pookses on how did they build on this wo mat can to prolong it thet thi suppering i ain got ther comes to an et comase's reasonable party how do those hostages and up in the gossipstrip we dof know who cares coms was always reasonable they were the oneswo are willing to make a deal because that is how works when you kidnap other people's children and then you are willing to make a deal to protect yourself youre still the bag i but not according to mas and be csma yelden we get the legacymedia claiming tha comassis hossage reliese strategy spells the beginning of a broader rounds of negotiations with israel's supposed new piece partner thesewould be the same people who just murdered twelve hundred as raily citizen six weeks ago and took two hundred forty hostages then there is claim number too that israel is morally equivalent in some way to homas ill get to that claim in just one second first i wont talked you about daily

slash ben ogay claim number one is that comas in that bad claim number too that the media are making and their allies in the radical islomic world and their allies on left is that israel is somehow morally equivalent to homass this claim these days usually takes the form of suggesting that israel is conincl carpet bomming gasa or in discriminate in its use of fire power that is absurd on its face according to homas itself israel has drolped about forty thousand bombs on gossa during this conflict also according to omass israel has killed about fifteen dousan people normally bombs kill more t an at zerel point three people particularly if you ware ausing targend weaponry what is more israel is prartecting civilian evacuation routes the commss is currently attacking israel is giving weeks of warning be fore striking sights israel is using a noch bombs to empty buildings israel's allowing commoss terras to merge into civilian populations rather than killing to many civilians israel is being more careful than any army in modern history given the urban contect of this war it again it is dealin with a terrace group that is predominantly hiding in urban areas that means civilian casualties will be high by necessity again that is not uncommon in war according to one paper in the journal frontiers of public health here are the civilian death rates by modern war meaning civilian deths over total deaths seventy four per cent inthe corean war forty six per cents in the eanomemar eighty eight per cents in the persian gulf war fifty six per cents in the bulkan war twenty eight per cents in the afganistand war thirty six per cent in packstan and sixty seven per cent in the aroch war yet the mediaaure participating in commosses moral equivalente to the hilt they are in fact acting as theu ommoss ought to be granted immunity and permanence specifically because they are hiding among civilians again their logicos that if commoss were out in battlefield is ral cad kilden but if commoss violates the laws of war than israel has to give them immunity basically grab a baby and s safe in tad this of course means that every terrascrup in the future is going to grab a baby and hide behind the baby yesterday ja taper of sianen ho been better tan average in this conflict actually aske for mas raily prime minister no tolybennet one of the medias typically cilly questions will not killing members of commostrous create new members of commas which is saying will not killing notses in world wer to just create new notses as been it answers if that is the case it is not possible ever to win a war but do not you think the last six weeks an dona lot to in insid in inspire a whole new generation a tarois i mean all the civilian dats i mean do not you worry h that in itself is going to raise and inspire wholeny generation a palastinn to hate is railies wa tat ima a i notyun in id on o the war war man ma a sivilliandaty yes you wa yo a fi ha war and we hav youry to a a and egogo a iin sivo ago reducin nember that ati wa a wa hav a a ha raiy ma o we pa la da ria wa that of course is exactly right again if the logic is if you kill badges wont to create new badguise that means you hve to leave the badguises in place but according to the walster journal the youes push to have israel fight a more targeted war signals is shift awav from president bidon's full throated support at the outset for the campaigned house commass and is the focus of now in tensife consultations between bidon and prime minister bentramin is nowho on how to handle the conflict certainly if thus has a mad wand it has been hiding israel will be all ears until then is the empty verbiage that lends credibility to comases lies about suppos it is really evils then there is claim number three that israel needs to make concessions to te palestonian authority in order to somehow curb comas the two state solution is the answer this is the claim of simpleton and dullerd thomas freedmen augustforn policy colonist for the execrable new york times who has literally never met in is rally con cession he did not love to day he writes that is quote a revamped palestonian authority is the keystone for the forces of moderation coexistence and decency triumphing in all wars it is the keystone for reviving a two state solution the palestonian authority since oslo thas been committed to reaching a two state solution tbased on the boarders that existed before the nineteen sixty seven war to believe this one must truly be an imbecile the palisnian authority from the outside of oslo saw the oslo cords as a trojan horse their leadership said as much oser arfat sed in nineteen ninety four quot this oslo greement i am not considering it more than the agreement which had been signed between our prophit mohammed and the korash that agrement by the way in the koran was the prelude o the slaughter of the koresh ovmako a few years after mahamed signed that false piece agreement this is why our fot increased terrast activity after oslo it is why he walked away from the camp david courds in two thousand and instead launch the second into fada it is why his successor halicoston iromachmudabs tha the exacting thing with ahoot omer the premonistr of israel intwo thousand eight the p a has never wnted a two state solution the p a is a terror group it remains a terror group that is whi the p has claimed that israel fabricated evidence ov october seventh and they have been soft pedling comasis a trocities on october seventh concessions to terroris breed terrorism it is that simple but the bidne administration continues to pretend that a two state solution led by the palestonian authority which again is led by a holicosan iron and mokmudabas is somehow in answer to hislomic extremism every day proves that these is totally wrong unfortunately thebiggest obstacle to piece in the idle east right now is the radicalized palestinian population and they have been raticalized over the course of generations by in doctrination from the leadership in the erab world by poling data the palestonian population does not want piece with israel they want it destroyed at is a again that is every piece of data that is coming from the population the population likes comas they palesonian is lomic ghod in knowthe were happy toking this thing and pretending that these terrors s are completely separate from the cevilian population in the scense that the terris our widely despised bopic by the population just opose the the terrace than magically peris as goin to bloom in the iddleleast or something it is a li in fact according tothe most recent polling data from a w r a d which is a moslem up polling outfit the palestonian authority has the support of a proximately ten per cent of palestinians that as the same level of support among palistinians as the western media here is somvidio of the palestonian population that is supposedly ready for pece this is footage of palestonians mocking is rally hostages being released over the pass couple of days including children and old women here are you can see crowds of palsinians jeering at mocking women being released back into israel after eing held posstage for a month and a half we keep hearing bout hawthe gossen civilians totally hate fomos i would love to see any evidence of that whatsoever onestatistical level at all and again people keep sanguel he cannot really took a pole in the gossistrip oke abut o pole the westbank or come os supposedlyising in controle they are wildly popular in the westbank according to the west clearly the answer is more is raely concessions say they had turned over the entire gossis strip entirely to comoss well that obviously worked out amazingly well last time then there is the fourth and final clam that jobidon is an electoral dangers specifically because o israel's war to exterminate come oss the bidnes to abandon israel in order when the election that too is ridiculous and its li the data simply do not exist to suggest the bidinselectoral trouble is specifically because of israel and ma goso war on october seventh jobidon was riding at forty four per cent in the poles against tontal trump according to the real cleir politics pulling average to day he is writing out forty five per cents in those exacts an poles on october seventh he wis at forty point five per cent in his approval rating to day heis at forty point four per cent in other words nothing has changed since october seven but the media rebeating the drums if bidin does not cave to omss he will lose te youthfot and he need citizens these ones from oklan who went wild last night when the city council considered condemning com os this actual tabe from the oaklan city council these are people who live in your country tese are people who you live next to and whose tax dollars you aren' your sendig your taxsollars presumaly to pay their welfare bills here we go there is not been beheadings of babies and rapings israel murdered their own people on october seven calling hamoss the terras or inis asionis ridiculous racis and plays in to dantisital propaganda that is fligting our mediadnthat we should be doing everything possible to combat i support the right at polistinians to resist occupation including throughhamos the armed wing of the unified polistinian resistance as an irab asking with this contaxt to congamhamas is thawy anti irab racis the notion that this was a massacre of jews as if fapricated narrative many of those killed on october taganhavia time is hat including children were killed by the idea and a menment condemning amos is balld propagandamen to a thanki yar time is that bu heare them complaind about hamoths violence is tithing to a wive piger complain one is wie finely things up and fights bak these are the people that jobidons required to listen to according to the legsy media these are theccorparts of bidan supposed constituency according to the walster jernal roughly half of americans eighteen to twenty four years old think come oss is october attack was justified by grievances of the palsinians according to a harvard haris pole only nine per cents of people age sixty five an old or feel the same this according toth media is the real danger to jobidans reelect efforts in twenty twenty four and this again is ridiculous here is the deal bidin either be runnig again sonl trum literally the most pro isral president in american history by far or rondestantis or nicky haly the most pro isral candidates in american history by far are all these comossellovers can a stay home and watch one of those three be elected what is more those age sixty five an older vote far more often than those ege eighteen to twenty for tis trun every election cycle an incremental gain among the crazed young voters would likely be ou waighed by an incremental loss among all the voters who do not particularly homas besides which many young people are just plain stupilit do not ouhave to drawe line somewhere here for example to day's example of higher level stupidity this is columbia university there is a m a truck that is driving around and it has on at pictures of people who signed a statement in support effectively of commass and these are students from columbia who apparently do not know how dock tape worksmit ihonestly this thisi the greatest example of what our universities are it is a bunch of absolutely over educated complete dolts who do not know how to use a rule of duck tape it is amazing letis it that they litter that is not out that is not how docktape works guies le thats they beli a tiny little tiny little bit of duck tape above the actual paper that the're trying to tape up and it is ont working because why are they why are the putting e tape all way across the cartboart by honesto god my sevenear old sundess had usedoc tape it n this it muct but then probably they have ther their agreement al leastern studies ther'e doing an amazing chop of the sdoc tape just truly in crable job also that ow ta rippeductape about his scissor anyway but biden needs the votes of these morons the media have their story an they are pushing it but here isthe dill israel's not can stop in any case because they cannot here is the idea of spokes person explaining and where this is going forward from here is that we are ready and as soon as we will get the green light from the government of the state of visral to continue operations we will do because we understand that there is a direct link between ground operations and pressur on homas and theire willingness to e hand over the hostages and we are ready an equipp to do and i hope that that will he commence as soon as possible every day that thes raty hosto dis or return is great but we are preparing for the next stage of operations and we are have or sie firmly focussed on the aim to this mantal commas to make sure that never again will any teristorganization in gos a have the ability to do wat comas did on october the seve that is exactly correct is ral cannot stop the leather and of doing it alone or they will dell with western holpso wha dos it actually matter if the wst backs is rill in ous battle well it certainly means one thing above all others a west perceived as wek cowardly horse is a west ripe for the taking that is why the west has a stake here because the weaker the west looks the more radical is leme sar on a look at the west and the are going to salevate a happy talking wst is a weak west and that happy talking west t un fortunally is not relegated to the israel commass war and as we have seen hundreds of thousands of people marching in the streets in support and solidarity with comass as we have seet governments tossing out members ofther own government for pointing out that maybe procomoss protests ire actually ci con a bad that happen in he brish government what we are watching is a west that seems ripe for tho take memberace o something everon's readig yo somban laden letter from two thousan and to tong about all his grievances but the're forgetting that the reason that has somban laden decided that hu's going to attack the united states is becaus he thought that the west was a week horse he set it himself and that part is strue in themiddle least and truly inform polisy generally when people are perceived as ripe for the taking people move to take that is how it works form polisy is a game of power proseption it is not about moral suation it is not about being right is about being strong and if you are perceived as week if your perceives is vacillating you are opening yourself up wide for a hard right to the jaw nho get to more on this in just

perception of western weakness can be manifested in many ways it can be manifested morally it can be manifested with regard to for example open emigration the open emigration debate that is been currently on going in the west is total insanity of course it is one thing two suggest is the united states did for much of its early life that a in open emigration stands with no welfare states is not a terrible idea because youre gin to get the hungriest people the an't leve their welfare state here they were and here gn to come to place with no welfare state and ther're goin be forced by the market to integrate into the market which means for example learning english it means for example adjusting to the businesst valluyes of the community already in the united states that is true of the emigration policies of the united states basically between the civil war and nineteen twenty and then in nineteen twenty we started to restrict emigration a lot of that was or of know nothing ism but by the ineteen thirties in the rise of the welfare state suddenly th mouth started change because again if you if you have a bakery and u put a sign in the windofs is free dough nuts every one welcome wha de youlio on come for the freedoghnuts it is con drive a very different crowd then open for business delicious doghnuts for sale it is a different thing or help wanted rite thes all all three of those signs are diffrent mssages free doughnuts every one welcome is a very different signe from help wanted which means come here if you want a job will pay you or don' nut's forsale which means come here and engage in our market and when the united states and when the last put out the welcome mat for people by saying come on in yourn't ave to a similate youren't have to be engaged in the market at all you'n basically come here and create your own onclaves in which you continued to despise western values well taking welfare dollars of course that is gan to change things and of course it is going to lead to a massive backlash lhat back lash is already materializing over in ireland were as we discuss o earlier this weet conomac greggor is now under in vestigation by the irish police for having the gall to suggest the perhaps emigration policy in ireland is badly manage the irish prime minister who is just been a moral bleep show i he am he yesterday spent his his tate complaining the people were connectin crime with with migration which im is not it though i mean letless be real about this when virtually every country when you have a lot of poverty stricken people coming to your country from foreign cultures that is going to come with som aditional crime and none of that crime has to be there because again any country the definition of a country is a country an control of its borders that is the definition an here is the irish pri d minister saying tha it is insensive to talk about these things just fin imination too am the terrible events tat tha that occurr to upon os square on carrs stay i i read with ask people tto try in avoids n connecting i crime with migration an it is not right an yes of course a people who are migrance mi commit crimes i just tas people are not ma crimes id a country of five poin threeminlin people i feu hundreds of thousands of micrance they are going to be a few of them i commit terrible crimes just the thr our people born a bread an irelands to commit terrible crimes every day incuding murders o gay but the difference is that if you are born and bread an ireland ore an irish citizen ireland has an obligation to impor people who or criminals or who cannot be that the same thing is true of the entire west and yet the west has decided to blind itself to this fact and again when the incentives change your going to get a different type of person who becomes an imigrants that just t is what it is as our rip on people that is a reality about people again change that sign inthe bakery window is can h change the kinds o people who enter the bakery or doing the same thing here in the united states alehan ther aarcus who should be im peach for failure to his job when he just awful the homeland security secretary he is been garbage this whole way we have had a consistent on going migration crisis at our southern border for years on end with extraordinarily generous asylum and refuge policies the basically allow any one to come to the border claim that ther are refugy the ushered ins the interior of the united states and then be set free here is all hon the myark is pretending that everybody's coming i legally is nasset to the united states that is not true some people come to the united states may be assets to the united states frankly we do not know but the idea that everyone who crosses the southern border is magically in asset to the united states is clearly false it also does not address the other sort of a elephant in the room which is dealing with on document at i emigrants who are already here in the nation and i know i's been a political football as a fundi figor out the best way to addrest that but 'm gon to ask you what is the best way to addrest that from your perspective the answers quite clear and quite straight forward and we have been waiting for ird for about thirty years and that is to fix a system that everyone agrees is fundamentally bo and and we need congressional action both for are the lawful pathways ae that really need to be more ro bust in statue and for the twelve million people oour here n the united states who have been contributing fundamentally to our countries well being there are neighbors our friends or fellow congregants are they provites our our frontline workers are we need to do something and ar i am hopeful in some our assets and some really really are not and your generalized to open bordern policy which has something been promoted by by an administration clearly which is wy we have migration crisis is a sign n of weakness to the rest of the world obviously it is why have people marching to the border chancing jobheihten's name right now some senta democrats are beginning to see the light because they realize this actually really bad policy thern to see this happen in europe as well as rightwing parties start to make serious headway on the emigration issue according to politico a growing number of sent a democrats appeare opens making at parter from migrans to seek asylum in order to secure apub lican support frating yeu crane in israel there motiv ated not just by con cern for americas an battled allies they also believe changes are needed to help a migration crisis that is gowing more dir and to popentially dull the sting of political borer politics in battle ground states before the twenty twenty four elections tjohn tester democratemontana who is a very vulnerable center is his look i think the borne tom attention a'm one that thinks it does hurt tester says he is eager to see if a by partisan crp of negotiators can come up with an agreement on depolicy issue as elusive is emigration senetor temu baldwan adnother vulnorable democrats as i'm certainly ocat with border policy being part of a national security supplemental on changes to asylum policy she said what i'd to see us makes in by partis an progress which has eluded us for years the system is broken that is exactly right and neither left his con a figurad out or the left is an suffer the political consequences an meanwhile when we speak of weakness the great institutions of the west deciding to abandon their most o fundamental values and attack those within the institutions who still defend the fundamental valies that is another level of threat a we are seeing that materialize over the course of pope francisis rain in the vatican pope francis is not benedict is not john polisecan pope francis is a liberation theologist in it there is no other way to read his activity inside the vatican i know that for a lot of catholics that is that is a hard thing to to recognize in and think about but the reality is that he is predominantly in economic markis with serious liberal leanings on the social issueside which is why he is put all of his fokus on redistributionis politics in vironmentalists an environmentalis m in ripping on supposod rightwing catholics or simply abiding by traditional doctran with regard to social politics elgube t issues the one the really the only socialissiuewhrehes been fully con sistent with the church over the corsetimes benabortion all the other issues he his shown wavering on will now he is militorizing his stands by going after cardinals who disagree with hin according to the newor times almost as soon is pope francis to can the head of he roman catholic church and twenty thirteen raymonburk an american cardinal emerged as is leading critic from within the church bhecoming into facto antypope for frustrated traditionalist who believed francis was diluding doctran france has frequently to moted in stript te american cleric of influencs this month the pope afparently finally had enough according to one high ranking vatican official who spoke on the condition of anninimity france has told the meting of high ranking vatican officials he intended to throw the cardinal out of his vatican subsidized apartmen and deprive him of his salary as a retired cardinal the news the possible ofviction was first reported by the concervative italian newspaper that nuova bosoto quotiadana im in screw this up it is close to cardinal burg and recently sponcsard a confrans featuring the prelet criticizing a major meeting of bishops convene by francis that news papers repart comes only a week after francis removed another vocal conservative critictures of strickland the bishop of tilor texas after a vatican investigation into the governants of his diacis apparently asked about the report of at conspokesman matal brooni de clines to confirmers o niht tong or pors cord i do not have anything particular to say about that well ros to that who is on a catholic himself he has a peace today in the nor times settle pope francis tries to settle accounts which is obviously a reference to the godfather their settling all family business adc for years pope france is governents of the roman caholic church has been seemingly destined to drive the churches concerned and liberal wings ever further apart thus the persistent question hanging over his puntificate howl he hold this thing together by opening debate on wide r ray of hot button subjects without delivering explicit changios hehas en count he has encourage the churches progressives to push the envelope as far as possible even toward real doctrinal rebellion in the hopes of dragging him along at the same time by favoring the progressives in his personal decisions and making institutional war on legsy of john poll the secon and pope benedict the sixteenth h has pushed conservatives toward crisis paronois and revolt on both fronts is done clear whether the papaties weakening authority con pull either group of rebl's back then the last few weeks we have seen a clear attempt to use that authority a real tust of the popesibility to keep the church together he is moved against two of his sharpest critics on the right that be strickland and burke he has also tried to draw bright line against the experiments of german bishops the leading progresive faction issurig letters o claring any reforms the germans contemplate cannot change the churches teaching on the allmal priesthood an te immorallity of homosextual relations but the reality is that again the pope keeps handing signals to the progressives that he basically agrees with them he just oesn't want ta move to fast the reality is that liberal catholicism is failing it is failing rostav hat says pifalcism does not have a large umber of conservatives or progressive priests coming along in germany in fact they have almost no younger priests at all the're only forty eight new seminarians in germany in twenty twenty two for church that still serves twenty one million self identified catholics the accistential crisis popes explain the intensity of pressore for liberalization and protestant isation because to many german catholic leaders this feels the only way for ther church to survive but the reality is that the only growing secments of any churches synegocs to in the united states are the ones that actually abide by trititional dictots traditionalist churches traditionali synegots those are the ones tht are growing progressive churches progressivesinegots are dying out bes it turns out if ye just want a go to the democratic party rally an go to a democratic party rally and it does not take all that kneeling and saying stufph and latin and eating foods he sco get some peatside a democratic party rally and dire hair blue and baseclly achieve the same goal if yo an not join a calt the culte of left wingism is much more fun than the cult of progressive christianity which still bears that weird tinge of bizar guilt and obligation the fact of pope francis has been actively going after his conservative opponents and if y if you want u thing the future of the catholic church this would be the way to do it this would be the way to do it and then again that that happens to be true of virtually every one else in religious life these days the single worst thing that has happened to the lest over the course of the last seventy eight years rely since the end of world were to has been that a cline of religion i the west that cline of religion the lest is led to a awide rise in radical theologies masquerating is politics in's been really really bad the answer to that is not a church that abandons it is scentral principles in favor of trying to cater to people who hate those principles and hate the church the answer to that is a more muscular respons on behalf of eternal truths if

social medialist for being one of the most influential young social media influencers in the world thie's going to the yor post the business magazine honored the former budlight spokes person among twenty nine other social media personalities wove shaped the creator economy well i mean he shaped the crator economy by almost bankrupting a massive company by light there is that malvany of course went to the white house and jobidon pretended that malvany was in fact a woman in addition malvane the allet o the honored other young social media creators in cluding commedans allan chicken chal and

the funnius movy the decade it is goin to be out friday night eight p m eastern you will only get access to it if you come a dailywares subscribers to go do that right now can me speing of the media be clowning themselves i have to say as we talk about te for the medias supply of racism the the supply of racism does not eet demands the media are desperately desperately in need of a supply of racism because they write about full tin and they have decided that theyare just going to make up stories now about racism the latest is a story about a young kansa city chiefsfan who war face paint the face pain is half black and half ret the cate is wearing kansas city chiefs colers is aces painted half black and half red and he is wearing a headress you now to canta city chiefs mascot and tum dead speen reporter karon philips wo apparently spends all day just booking desperately for for some sort of racism to report a ackused this kid named holdin ar menta of mocking black people after seeing a picture in profile which did not show the half of his face painted red philips also slam tholdin's native american headress and his tomahok chop gesture claming little boy had quote found a way to he black people an native americans at the same exact time there is only one problem is oneof the great selfhon swell time it is fan frickantastic turns out that thekid actually has native american heritage his grandfather serves on the santa yunez band of cho mash indians the team's malti athnic squat had enthusiastically joined in with holdin's indian shopping justur the kid is technically native american but his also apparently race he says hit takes a lot of r disrespect to dis respect two groups of people at once firs again becas puttng on kensichieves colors black and red he is not mockin black people an e's not mocking red people those are the colors of the team in the same way that if you were for example an elle laker's han yellan gol i'm in golden golden purple right tht'd be that thu'd be the colors but that is he said that he is races against black people and also racist against native americn meople and the kid is native american and then he he adiquote this is what happens when ban books stand against critical race theory and tried to a race centuries of hate you give future generations the amal they need to evolve in recreate racism better than before that is the stupidest thing i've ever heard first ofalt that is a great case for bandin critical race theory because critical race theory makes yon more on makes yo a dummy it maye see the kind of person who believes that kid painting his face in the team colors his raceis for doing elon musk i then a congratulated his steem for spotting the error in this because there is a m a community notes tht got attached pointing out ha stupi this is the polet ser nominated reporter was on abash this ka's not made for poetzer attur shows the poletor is these dase for the idiots on my mention or treating this is some harmless act because the other side of his face was painted red i could make the argment it is even worse yellar th one who hate mexicans but wear sombreros on sinko what sondiga complete nonsequer again just amazing work there superamazing work there from dead spin for making is kidrich because this kid as gon a file a lowsu you would not believe and it is going to be great and i am here for it joining in the clown show was of course clown dan lebetard who is a a a supposdsports commintator who spends his day doing progressive politics most of time or least more than he showd and he defended the dead spin peace he said no matter what you should never put black and red commination on your face ever it is races do not do it ever here is a picture of a dan lebtard last year dressed up as a member of a rockman he is running black an rd on his face or no that is who it must be racis musby racis again thes supply of raceis him in the united states is just not keeping up a demand into the price is rising that is what is happening here i gan meanwhile the twenty twenty four race continues a pace dona trum way out in front obviously of the rest of the field butt the coke nutwork has now announced that they are going to back nickey haley ac going to the walter journal americans for prosperity action a conservative grop bled and partly finance by charles coke said tuesday would support the former south carolina governor andyuan ambassador the organization support is to boosta haley as the campaign enters the final seven weeks before iwa a if he said she has what it takes to lead a policy ag endted take on our nations biggest challengeis and help in sure our country's best days our head with the grassrts and day to capability wo bring to bar in this race no other organization is better equipped to help her do it the question is whether she hass grassrots momentum weather she has infor struction ore take n ange the the biggest question in this race is what is the dynanic thatlas any candate wh is notonal trumpto d fee town trump if you want trump defeaded in the primaries the problem with haley is that if te sansis rops out his support does not go to haley if te sansis trawsit drops out his support will largely go by pulling data to trump and then the race is over that just that is the mamph again i really ambassador halea leknickey a latch is a wonderful person she is done a lot a good things particularly is tou an ambassador she is done a good job in this race if nickey nox to sancis out to santis is going to his votes will go to trump that is where they are going by contrast if haleywere drop out her votes would largely go to tdo santis now is that mean any of them have a chancis topping trump we right now again he is a formidable favorite if the sansis does not wen i what h's out ofthe race mean i's really that simple if the sansis does wen iwa and haleywin's new hampshire they go to south carolina haley maywin south carolina and at that point trump probably runs the thable if you look at the rest of the race unless there is this sort of god bleeds mentality in which trump has ben wounded and now people do not vote for him but again i do not see the dynamics of the race radically shifting in favor of of nickey haley if ronda sansis drops out of the race that that is inherently the problem in just the second will get t o

still in iwa the latest poll from iwa state civic has trump up fifty four to de santis eighteen to nickey haleys twelve vake is coming in at six per cent in that particular poll again on average trumps at forty seven and t santis is it seventee ounce calk es state you cancy big moves in places iwa in new hampshire trump again still has a big lead in second place this time is haleysh sort of flip flops with de santis actiol cristy is still polling in the low double digets eleven per cent in the latest washington post monmouthpoll aut of new hampshure but trumps at forty six haly at eighteen chrissyat eleven and to santis at seven even vavake is actully pulling ahead of to santis to santis looking to recapture some magic one blays uons to do that is havig debate with gaven newsfrom the governor of californy who is runng a shadow campagning case jo bidon should keel over which is not an insignificant possibility before the election newsums entire stick is to pretend that every other state is worse than his own there is only one probabl ith that as a former resident of california a lifelong resident of california it is not true if the reality is that again gavenuwsum has governed the statelike arbage california is in serious trouble if if you look at the run down of florida vertsis california the editorial bord th waltergurna has a good run down today employment since january twenty nineteen employment has increased by one million thirty one thousand in florida while declining by eighty five thousand in california unemplo men despite as shrinking labor force californtia's four point eight percent chablistrate is the second heighs in the country nearly twice as high as florida's two point eight per cent business formation florida has received two point sevend million now business applications since january twenty nineteen one frevery eight residents compared to one frevery eighteen residens of california personal income business and worner workerarnings have increased byn annual compounded seven point seven per cent in florida since the first quarter of twenty nineteen compered five per cent in california populate ion migration between july twenty nineteen n july twenty twenty two over a million californians left forother state that include most o my family while seven hndred thirty seven thousand people on nett moved to florida that means according to latest diarrestato california lost fifty fifty five points seven billion dollars and adjusted grows in come between twenty nineteen and twenty twenty one energy price are twice as high in california as in florida state local taxin california at up to ten thals n one hunded sixty seven dollars per capita for ss five thousand four hundred six in florida pensions were fifty one poin to billion dollars in california last year for the seven point three billion in florida medicate california spends a hundred and twenty nine point to billion dollars anually on medicair mor than four times as much as florida homelessness californi as a hundred and seventy one thousand homeless people firstis twenty six thousand in florida agan bottom liner is that californi is leap sho and florida is doing pretty well ow that is a preegood basis for a present antual campaign you would think but again politics is performative these days i think to santis will duell in the debate against nuwsum but until somebody shows a real challenge to either bidon or to trump they are the for gon nomines at this point i mean they are obviously the front runners very very cleaterly a meanwhile republicans running into a bit of an interesting pickle theve supinan hunter bidon to talk about his dad and his business deals will now his lawyers are saying that he is going to come testify but only publicly according to politico as hunter bdon facs faced a protracted criminal probe for years ho is told coopera with prosecurers an waite quietly for exoneration that is stroutis you fail will now he is taking his ot his adversaries on directly over the past three months hunderbine has filled to barageof law suits and has challenged his indichtment on gun charges by attacking the prosecutionis dainted he is even trying to spen a trum the counteroffendcibill platt in court rooms and in public justice is father rams up his reelect campaign som of jobiton day's ar worrd that is oing to elevate bidon in the public iye hunter bidon that is and that the more you see of hunderbide nelest oare going to jo that of course is certainly quite possible however it is also true that hunterbidon is trying right now to respond publicly to republican a tems to supina him by saying that dom they want him to testify not behind closed doors in a letter tuesdays the house overside chair jims comer hunder bidon's lawyer suggested that do instead of hundred test fing behind tw se doors he wants a public hearing on december thirteenth argue d quote prevent selective leeks manipulated transcripts doctrine exhibits or one sided press statements course tht will be largely per formative but am i in favor of open hearings supposed to close hearings tand tha substant iv the hearings aregin to be hav out both have a get in open hearing with hunter and get closes hearn in the open hearing he can jabber about how he is being mis mistreated onfairly and how he is just a child leave the children alub and the close dor hearing maybe get some substancive answers out of him but not not not a dumb political stragegy the bottom line note is hat again jobiton is facing a he is facing an up hill battle for reelection thet's be real about this the poles are not in jobidon's favorite right now and in the best argument that any of the other candidates originally had against trump which that trump cannot be biden that is ol the poles are suggesting right nows that is a very hard argument to make just on the data points and that is coming from somebody who is likely not s vote for trump in the primaries if the santis or haley is on the ballat in just one second we have to get to the weardest story of the day courtesy of the washington post you are not going to believe this

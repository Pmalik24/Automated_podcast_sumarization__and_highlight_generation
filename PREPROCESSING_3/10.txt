one of the great qualities of dictatorship is that dictators can hold the line even as democracies start to fay that of course is the theory a pey much every dictator across history when faced with a democratic rival that is certainly the theory of vladmerpouten to day whether it is in eu crane or weather it is with regard to him just killing yow the people who oppose him people elexy navalni and is becoming very clear this week that vladmerpoutent is now settling all family business this is the week where he feels he has the ability to do exactly what it is that he wants and the reason he feels that way is because a combination of splits on the right in te united states in accommination of splits on h left in the united states as well as splits in the european colition with regard to russia when vladmerpouten invaded ucrane there weres pretty much unanimity that this was not something that the west could allow to stand tht you could not have ladmrpoutent simply walting into keives takin over the country killing vladmir's lensky and essentially setting up a puppet dic tatorship in turning neu crane into a second bellerus you could not have that because it would put russia directly on the borders of e wid rity of nato countries including hungary and polen yet you could not have it because it would certainly threaten former soviet sadellite states astonia lafia litheuania all of which are deeply fearful of a pooten led incersian into their territory finland as well you could not have it because ucrane actually is relatively major producer of products wheat and oil and mostly could not have ecause ladinerpouten has interest tht are antethetical to those of the west and for all of the talk about over the last twenty five years ofhow vladmer potent was just on the cusp of moderating how it thers can be a moment when vladmerpooten was welcomed into the family of nations and then he would just be nice to everybody that never happen every single president of my lifetime has tried a rest with ladmerpouten george doll be bush famously looked into pouten's eyes and thought he had a sense of his soul and thn you had borakobama who literally sent hillery clint in his secretary of states to moscow to give them a button that did not actual say reset but was supposed to be a reset button and then you had ladmer poutent being offered flexibility biborokabama intwo thousand twelve in the lead up to the twenty twelve lection when then donal trumcam into the office in the basic assumption was the donal trump was going to lead to a warm relationship with pouten and i have gobiden who came into office t was immediately pretty soft on russia in terms a sort of geo political stritetery as george oby bush once put it that that take has been proved false time and time again vladmerpouten is a highly intelligen highly skilled adversary of the united states his interest do not a line with the interest of the west the chief russian motivation in this has been true for a literally centuries is territorial ambition there is been true since the time of peter the grat and cather in the grat man if you an't go back even further this been terucentime i the terrible in that the fact is thatif you look at russian historier have any sense of russian history russia's great leaders are always messure by the amount of land they control which makes a certain amount of gio political sens if you are russia because again russia is a giants step meaning it is open to invasion from all sides and if you'r russian one of the things that historically you have attempted to do is expand your borders as to prevent invasion from all sides out a certain point that defensive justification becomes at all fencive strategy in which are invading sovereign nations that exist all around yun atempting to control top down a russia has always been in empire since the time of muskovy and now you are watching as ladmerpouten tries to expand the boundaries of what he sees as his new empire ean he himself compared himself to puter o the grat just a couple of years ago after the invasion of you crane and when you watch the interview that he did etucker cralsin where the first thirty five minutes is dedicated two his idea of russian claims to u crane in which he actually sorto makes the claim that russia has claims to polan and hungary is well whent when he says that sort of stuff we ought to take that seoriously he is actually spelling out what he actively thinks now their bunch people on the left who think the ladimerpootenis doing this because he is offended by the muscularity of the west that if only the west had been more conciliatory tward fladmer pooten than russia would not in fact being adversarial force that everything of ladmerpootn does his blow back to the west that is the theory of of people on the left who are very much vacillating with regard to what lamerpouten is tring to do and then there are a couple of theories on the right and those theories range from the blow back theory people ripping that off from john mer shimer the form policy scholar whi think is wrong about a great manything john mershimer has sort of forize that it it is nadofs expansion that drove pooten to invade sauth o seeshufor example an georga or drove pooten to invade crimea and tat on baseretion aoriginally in twenty forten an the invade the rest of you cran in twenty twenty two read that there is that theory which again is coincident with the left wing blow back theory of american form policy that dae solvway back to

secular leftism the russia actively is is a highly religious country that is that is very an ti mush of the left wing ideology with regard to say gender and sax an sectuality that the west has fallen for and they have built up in their minds lot of people the idea that because russians are socially conservative as a general matter which they are that this is somehow what vladimer putent represents as opposed to he has a population that is socially consertive and also that is not his actual ambition his actual ambition is not in defense uf a social conservatism his ambition is in defens a russian territorial ambition it is a category error in other words for many people on the right mayfiel on the right have made that same category error for example with chareal law countryiis in the alomic world that suggested tat because those countries are gone quote socially conservative that somehow those countries have a commonality with se american conservatism american christian conservatism and the answer there is no they really donet their ambitions are not the same as your ambitions and what this really reveals is a schism in the united states broadly rid then in the wess broadly written europe as well a schism about wheather the west has any sense of internal solidity what are the values of the west ecause if pouten is able to split the west on the basis of perceived values or perceived anti westernism as has their lot f people in lest really do not west very much on the one hand and lot fpeople inthe west who believe that the greater threat to the united states might be their neighbors who dis agree with them about social politics as opposed to people vladimer putent not the vladimputents af direct threat to people in the united states right this instant but he is a very large indirect threat to people in the united states because geopolitics actually matters when you cut off shipping roots when you destroy the sourcees of international trade when you threaten american alies these are things that actually will matter to american citizens rit large ay laterputeness figuring that the history of the united states since world war too is if you can split the american public you can win and does 't matter how weak you are all yes to do is outlast outlasting is the strategy i's been true since hoachy men in viotnom it was true of the taleban an ouf ganistan it was true of chareal law eronean forces in aroch if you can out last te united states you will win and the time for out lasting is shrinking an shrinking and shrinking used to be that order to outlast the american public you ould have to waiy to decade and now because of the velocity of social media and because of the ability of people to see these arguments in real time an split from each other and polorize very quickly what your seeing is that the west is sapped of its will incredibly quickly on nearly every conflict when there is a conflict with true evil you see western powers immediately leap to fight the evil and then pritty quickly start to doubt themselves and figuroca i think were done here we n to move on with our lots now this would be a timewhen political leadership actually matter bu there is a complete diarth of political ledership on b t sides of the political isle on these matters jobidon is utterly incapable of orticulating the rahion ow why americans should carry if russia invade you grant he does not he does not even attempt tarticulated he is just spouts words democracy without taking full stock of the actual situation four americans cause american's look at jobidon state things democracy and the sa waight hold up a second you crane first of all is an extrordent in extraordinarily imperfect democracy and the freedom house score for you ranes thirty nine russias seven but you cranes thirty nine does not lamazing well spring of democracy it is a burgening democracy at best and when you say democracy over and over americans whatl is that really what ou crane is about and then american say whal if if that is what you cranes really about then whire we allies with says sout eurabia co saut erabia obviously is not a democracy by the way a lot of our allies hor not democracyes sare to get very nervous when they her democracy talk coming from jobidon becaue ir locase whatting an arab spring us over here the real reason why the united states is pursuing a defence of you crane e's because we have geostratigic interest in degrating the russian military capacity to expand beyond its own borers threaten shipping lanes threatening supply resources increasing the power of enemies of america and america's allies russia has formed antofacto colision with china and eron at this point and that' a facto colition threatens americas allies all around the world and threttens freedom of the sees for example everywhere from the tiwan strait to the straits of moloka to the red sea to the traits of harmoos and that that coalition it is extremely dangerous and the united states does have a geo political interest in down grating that but that is not something that jobidin can explain because he cannot se words any more and probly does not understand the words that he is saying right now and on the right there is a split about whether these things even matter there is this bazare idea that is arisen on large parts of the right that america can become atarkic that suddenly global economics do not matter at all that if he that if things go to hell in a hand basket with regard to the freedom of the seas in tese particular areas at will not effect american citizens in any way mmu's explain if shipping starts to be truly endangered the way that it is in the red sea in any of the other areas that i just mention the amount of money that americans are going to pay is going o be much larger than whatever checks we are signing to crane it will make our head spin if you love to the inflation of the first couple of years of the biding ero wait until freedom of the sees goes ways something tha you are going to enjoy o case it in any case vlamerpootent knows all this because all he has to do is just keep pressing all yes to dois keep pressing and he is taking full admanage he sees the splits andhe is exploiting those splittert he is a smart player lederhoot is a smarto political player who sees form policy is a zero some game and no attempt to a peas ladmerputent through happy talk is going to work again i wen through the verious administrations in the united states since ladmerpuon took office into thousand everysing one ofthose administrations has tried a the tant policy with lanmerpooten and all of them fail its gess what every one of those administrations ends every one of them has a shifting congress and ladra utan still there ruling in unitary fashion the downside of detatorship is i generally means a poorly run country that has no feed back loops for improvement of the country y can list certain countries by the way that have had quasy dictatorships that have actually run farally well that was true for example of a sing aport for several decates but it is very rare more likely it turns in to a corrupt oligarcy in which the leader use is his position in order to enrich himself and his friends in order to insure his own powar and destroics his adversaries and one of the best ways to maintain your own power is to destroy things internal property rightes in political freedoms because if you give property writes that may lead to the creation of a monitary bas fom which a threat can can mount against you laderpouten has been very very bad for the russian people if you do not believe me all yu ave to do is is look at the various g t ps per capata in the former soviet satellite states gt peeper capita right now in states poland it poland is a former ya tatellite state gg peeper capita there is about eighteen thousand dollars gt peeper capita in a stonia a former ya tatellite state is twenty eight thousand dollars gt peeper capita in loffia a former vyou tatelites at twenty one thousand dollars g peeper capia in russia right now is twelve thousand dollars somewore in that neihborhood lanrpouten has nop in a boon to russhok putting all that aside again lanerpouten is winning right now because all he feels he has to do is out last not only that the weaponry that we are shipping to ou crane in defense is much more expensive than the weapon ry the vlanerpouten is using in offense in u crane get's more on this in just one moment first are you struggling with back taxes or unfild returns at this year l i've got some bad news the irs is escalating collections by adding twenty thousand new agents in these challeging times your best offense use tax network ou ssay along with hiring thousands of new agents in field officers the ires has kicked off two thousand twenty four by sending over five million pay up letters to those who have unfiled tax returns or balance is owde is gas ar not your friends do not wave your rightes and speak with those agents on your own without back up tax network you ssay is a trusted tax relief firm and they have saved over a million dollars in back taxes for their clins they can help yu secure the best deal possible whe the o ten gran or ten million bucks they can help whether its business for personal taxes whethey have the means to pay or whether you are on a fixed income tax network can help finally resolved your taxburdens once in for all ceze control of your financial future right now do not let tax issues over power you contact tax network you a save for immediate relief and exper guidance call one eight hundred two four five six thousand or this it t n u sa dot com slash o pero turn to tax network yousa find your path to financial piece of mind that c and usa do com slash o pero the reason that vladnerpootent is able to ramp up his production which can last probably effectively another two to three years at the levels that he is currently producing ther speng six per cents of their gd pe on defens by whic mean offens in places u crane that is unsustainable for an economy that is truly on workable in russia they do not have a workable economy it is fifty per cent probably based on oil profits they they do have trading partners of course outside the west but have they been economically damaged by the warning crint absolutely tis damaged everybody but it has certainly hit russia in seeten terms of the inflation ra but the reality is that russia can produce an crappy old machinery an amo and it costs a lot less money then defensive machinery they you bythelyes use all over the globe a cost comass fifty bucks to to cratichat usha rocket that they can shoot in to in his raily city and accost israelect fifty thousand dollars every time they fire an irondome that sort of stuff happens all the time across theglobe sone of the reasons why th hoothies are being effective in the red sea right now all offensive measures that are basic and dumb cost almost nothing defensive measures which have to be sophisticated to stop the offense of measures are very very expensive which is why from a financial point ofview abut offense is better than defense from a financial point of veuw during war in the moment right now destroying the enemy's capascity to make wars actually easier than defending against the war that they are attempting to fight against you again all of this is just predicates the fact that vladnerpooten really is feeling his oates right now not only did he almost certainly kill electin of alne i see almost certainly because you try to be a little careful about these things but h he killed plush electing valney did not die of natural causes in a prison at the age of forty seven after being poison by v ladinerpooten just about for years ago and then immediately arrested upon his return to russia a sentence to a goolog for thorty pluss years and then he randomly dies that is not the way that works especially not for ladinerpooten who makes a habit of killing his political opponents and in fact unsurprisingly the crumlin has now rejected international calls acording to axios for an independent investigation in to russian opposition leader electing ofvalney's death in prison if alnese allies and family of course say that they suspect high level russian authorities were involved in his death which of course is absolutely true i'm sure the european council said mister nvolney's unexpected and shocking death is yet another sign of the accelerating and systematic repression in russia crumlin has they have refused to release his body tbecause they are afraid that if the releases body than there can discover the poison on him or the bruises on him or the broken bones or itever it is the country's prison service is said he died suddenly after a walk they claims he fell un conscious after feeling sick and could not be resuscitated of course all of this has sort of outsized to impact in the lest because there is very famous h beo documentary made about elecing ovalney that one best picture for ign best best ocumentary at the oskars just a couple of years ago it is a very very compelling documentary all about his poisoning and is attempt to track down the people who poisond him which he actually does heesshe calls one of his poisoners on the phone and gets them to admit the whole thing on the phone the very tale end of that documentary electiong fvalney actually is asked what is your message to the russian people in case o murdered and here is what he had to say i this tmnipro te ruhobe nevis the it san go dothing very obvious to telling o t what is thu sloy not alowed ang ev she tly you they decide to kill me it means that we are incredibly strong yon thethi you syoul b isi pus yes tho owe neds to utilize this power tan i give up y s remember were a huge power gthoria tbuin you ttisthat is being inpressed by these bad news thesttwe do not realize how strongly actually arhing ssmosnti ths the only thing necessary for the tryimg fof evil the bus it is for good people to do nothing do not be inactive and then he was murdered either his murder is a reflection of puten feeling threaten or his murder is a reflection ofthe fact that puttnt hings he get away with nearly anything at this point and it seems more the latter especially because they are not being shy about anything they are doing right now ladiner pouten according to the russian news agency the rssian goverment has now file charges against olig and avalney who is the who is the brother of elexyt navalney they said wanted under an article of the criminal code they did not specify what article navalle's brother was even wanto unders theyre just arresting elexing of all these relatives who are in russia right now and attempt to presumably quash any blowback from their decision to kill alexy navalney not just that on tuesday russia's main security agent agency said that they ad arrested another american citizen this personcs a duel citizen of russia and he united states on accusations of committing state treason by raising funs for u crane the affesp identifyd the detainy as a thirty three year old woman who lives in losangelis apparently she had raised fifty one dollars for you cranian organization that bought weapons and other equipment for ou crane's military that is because she had sent fifty bucks to rasum for you crane nw york based non profit organization that sends assistants to the country and a the fesp released of the russian state media avidio that showed the woman wearing a white hat that cover her as being hand cuffd in escorted by massed security service officers if convicted she faces twenty years in prison and of course this makes perfect sense considering that russia is making just a balanty off of american citizens the kidnap if they arrestpbritn griner for being foolish enough to fly to russia with pot in her bag andthen they throwin prison they can get an actual hi level russian armstealer released in return for that they are still holding the walstra journal reporter ave'n gershklich ifthy've they have no compunction about just rannimally kidnapping american citizens that this is no problem for them why because they are not afraid of

again a russian pilot who defected shu krane has now been apparently murdered according to the nearor times macsimen kuzmanofv pulled off a daring escape last summer when he defected shue crane and handed his military helicopter over two craning commandos in exchange for half million bucks you crane trumpeted the defection as major coo in vladner poutin's russia he was guilty of treason you cranin intelligence officials warrnt kouzman of his lifes and danger they urshhim not to leave the country instead he moved with his money to small resort town on spains mediterranean coast and now he is been found murdered he is twenty eight or was twenty eght two spanish police officials with knowledge of the case said the body of a man found riddled with bullets last week in the costal town of village oyosa belonged to mister kuzmanoff andre turnak representive of you crane's military and tell said he could confirm the fact of his death there is no in formation abut the possible assailants or motive very diicult to imagin that this person was not min riddled with bullets in a randam town in spain sounds pretty pootenee to tome an again considering that this is a thing that vlanrapouten does send hi his s fespe to do and again it is pooteni's exploiting te ivisions in the west ats what america's enemies would do right's what is what any country would do every country whoo seezs itself as a geo political opponents m another country hopes to exploit internal divisions the difference is that america the democracy and internal divisions are pretty obvious and clear wive a free press same thing is true in europe for all the probems we have in america or europe they are not remotely the same kind of promthery different in category problem rwhas happening over in russia presiden bidon had promised that there would be significant reprecussions against russia if nvalneat was killed unclear exactly what those reprocussions are going to beat poutnas figuring he can with stand anything at this point he is got his money inside the countryes got as dasha s he does not care according too yah who knews the bi dadministrational impose major sanctions on russia in response to the death of navalney john kurby what has nationals secured communications adviser said the new sanctions are designd to hold rush accountable for what happened to navalney as well as all its actions over the course of this vicious and brutal war that is raged in neu crane for two years un clear what that scon toby apparently viganoinvail the sanctions package on friday the question of course is how is that work far because of course the economic sanctions have not done tremendous damage to pooten or his inner circle the the realistic a ancer cure is that there are actually things that that bidon could do is one of the things thats truly amazing about bidon he will use executive power to try to cram down i vacting mandat on eighty million americans using the occupational safety in health administration he will attempt he legally to alleviate student lone dat by simply deciding that ou no longer have to pay it using his executive power but the one area of american waller the presiden does have tremendis outsize power is inform policy and bindberrely uses it he will not do it to shut down the border he will not do it to actually take measures he could take to punish for example the russians instead he is weak need and he is weak need because again virtually ever one on all sides in te united states is incredibly divided but thi situation hilites is the really not the evil lad repoutents the weakness of th west according to bret steven's writing over than your times he says their four broad approaches that could the oretically be used by bidon with regard to pouton according to bill browder whose an invester an political actives who has a really shocking book that he wrote about his experiences facing down puton he was a a financier who worked in russia for years and years and years anza and then was targeted becaus one of his business partner was surgayment nisky who is killed in prison by the by the pouton regime it he has a suggestion his suggestion is that you could enact legislation to confiscate frozen russian bank reserves for the defence and reconstruction of ou crane theoretically now everybody's been very un willing to do that because they are afraid that there would be a flight from dollar assets if that sort of thing happen whith you understand reat if you are a foreign actor in your afraid that the united states can a confiscate your money if itsheld in american dollars this could harm the american dollar that that is a risky move wit that sad you may have to take those sorts of risks if you hope actually punish a dictator theoretically you could back tisidence in more significant ways and stop stop with these hostage trades viou continue at these hostage trades puttings gy is just going to take more hostages and finally you could actually do the thing the bidon really will not do and that is jack up american production in the oil and natural gassector really rach stet up in this is it is an opportunity frankly on for america's economy the fact that the fact that europe is now cut off fon russian oil supplies would be an opportunity for the uniteds states to jack up itto ellen g production and sarct shipping all of that stuff over to europe instead jobidon is in thrall to his ratical left on the environment that he refuses to do any of that sort of stuff thit is more on this in just one moment

all first of all we must be sure that he does not step one foot into the white house not as president or not as anything now we have some one new ad the honor of serting in the white house did not consider it in honor did not consider his oath of office to protect and fend the constitution and on this week speaking out the way he did athout nnevony shows you that he is person without dalles he looks his goingto be a person without dollars either but the valuis of what concern us yes that the dollars a o whet he has oing o but i think it is proably financial and this probly financial eithers something financially as om or something on the come o gis announced o speculation about trump and pouten as supposed to actually not slow walking the aid to ou crane as gobidon has done for literal years taking the mddle position on everything and this is the nature of jobidons om jobiden is the president which means this happening on his watch all of the talk about republicans in congress ye republicans and congressor amass there is no question about that they cannot tell their aus from their elbow i mean that just is that is why they'ave now rotated through two speakers and a bunch of speaker candidates inthe course of a year their mass with that is that jobiden is the corn presidents of the united states i notice and it is under jobine the ucranean invasion took place nd is under jobidon that the american will to to baccu crane has fated the powar the bully pupit would be a thing but gobidin has failed to use it and he is not capable of using it and he has no moral clarity anyway and it turns out that forn policey issues affect each other when you abands in afcanistan that has impact on what russia does in ou crane and by the way when russia sees these sorts of half measurers that you are taking wit agrad to israel and commoss they fell the same way russia's an open ally of commoss a this point the have invited commoss to moscow to talk about situation over there and meanwhile the democrats are fully divided on israel and whether to support america's democratic ally in the middle east that provides a merica with intelligence resources and acts a essentially's a land based aeric car air crafts carrier for united states interest in thehe police and and we are telling them you cannot defend yourselves against come off to the exstenthat you take out commass nect in inrafacity is it t a that is what t gobidmnistrations completely split on this sort of stuff according to politico the israel commoss conflict is opening new rifts in the house democratic caucas with a second congressional progressive paucas quitting the group over the war and representer of sheeted to leav ut backing an activis campaign to undermine presidential bide in the michigan democratic primary the new developments underscore that more than four months in israel's military operations an goza are still causing a painful rift within the democratic party out whell i mean why wha m is is not israel's military operations this thing was not initiated by israel is initiated by commas committing the greatest atrocity against jews since world war too and yet this is somehow shattering the democratic colition warshly because of gun the the democratic party is split between their crazy wing and their actual sort of tratitional bates which tends to be more proisrael the younger insane generation that has been trained on nonsense by the garbage reporters that the washington post inyor times they continue to push the bide administration is simply conceve two comas and s what you have is a split inside the dministration you will have members of the byde administration out their talking about how the new popressur on israel and ten you will simultaneously have john curbyout their talking about how israel is doing its best to avoid cvilian casualties ther that thei'r speaking two languages to two different groups of people it is wyld and you see these two things comeinto conflict for the democratic party and rush a looks at this an the say look you thas cann get your act together out the most morally obvious conflict in modern world right now the conflict between again a democratic ally of the united states that was attacked in a fashion that four it sized dwarf's nine eleven and you can youen get on board with dem extrpating a terroriust group you cannot why woud rush oud think that they cannot outlast and and you can see the split and tonancy polosy was ripping on benjamininton yahu because this is the way the democrats have tryed to square the circle they trye to suggest that they support israeligius nolignito aho the probem is noneof that ma any sense because the reality is israel has a war cabinet right now they have a unity government right now all the talk abot ho bebing intond yahou is standin in the way of a palistinian state no the policinuencs have stood theway of a palistinian state since literally the inception of the peace process the called peace process was which was a joke again diplomacy cannot incept things into reality you cannot just wander your way into pece that not the way any of that works and as i say again the policy of the tate of israel with re gards the palston insright nout is a unity policy in fact to day eisraely cannus it voted on a on a proposition that proposition was with regard to the possibility of a palistinian state and what the proposition actually steat as resolution quote israell outright rejacts international dictates about a permanent arrangemet wit the palistinians such an arangement will be reached only through direct negotiations between the sides without preconditions israel continue to oppose you in lateral recognition of palistinian state such recognition following th october seven masscer will be an enormo suprize for terror a prize e ligkts of which have never been seen and will prevent any future piece agreement that was a resolution a prove by it is now and benny gons is chief rival also werth noting that thing passed in the connesset with ninety nine out of a hundred and twenty boats ninety nine get to that is aht that is a universal proposition nisrael but pollosa and the left they are trying to appeas they are left wing bays by blaming the tonyaho but then thate asking obvious question then wyre you supporting these raily government and they cannot answer that question becaus again they are constantly splitting the baby is not the ginto fo the you that if you do not what s whereis the the pesitis mad cer some of what

canli on era bu noboy can cake away oway any country ti decandi cati hav ine awa attac in that way get that that is an absurdity that is not the policyf nestn aho it is the policy of the entire war cabinet and israel has currently lost out two hundred and forty soldiers in gaza when they have complete air superiority the do not you do any of that they are doing that to avoid collateral damage bagain americ's enemies including aron russia aron china they see american weakness they see western divisions and they are exploiting that weakeness and o vision right now which is why whoh the attacks for example in the red sea are working according to the walztry journal a cargoship is at risk of sinking in the gulf ofade and after being hit by yem an base hoothy missile inthe most significant strike since the aron back group started launching attacks last fall the in creasing te audacious attacks come to by weeks of youas air strikes and highlight the challengeis of detering the group you cantatur the ou have to destroy them ou's obviously they are not to turd they are terrorists persistent wo these strikes are raising new questions for the bide administration about how to bring the attacks to halt and prevent the continuing wore in the gotestrip from fueling and worsy stablizing regional conflict the answer there is you let israel destroy its enemies and you destroy your own enemies and that is how you actually win wars but if the lest refuses towin wars mhen its enemies will in just one second we will get to how all this is impacting jobine's reelice efforts the answer things are not grat first president's day is a time to honor the great leaders of the nation who shaped our history and oure values wuts jimming carter but you do not have to be a president to

best shave of your life at twenty per cent off right now at jeremy's razors not come ook cam meanwhile how is all this chaos and inability to make a decision affecting jobidns poll chances we are not good a new siena college poll actually has jobidan under fifty per cent in new york in new york and by the way this poll is insane it shows that jews in new york according this poll im in israel outwir poleso weill se if it is reael or not fifty three per cent of jews in new york say they would vote for trump which is an astonishing number that is an astonishing number because remember the vastmajory the jewish community by jewish community i mean people who are born into a jewish family for example are not observant do not care about jeuish precepts do not care about israel there is a in increasing per centator jews wo are realizing that the left really really jusel lot but with that said that is an amazing number usually in everyelection seventy seventy five eighty per cent of jews bot for the democrats because the vast majority of jews are secular left us wo have no relationship wit their religion at all at but according to this polling data gan the suburbs are split thirty nine thirty nine men are are forty seven forty in new york for donald trump according to this sieniple and ot whether that is true or not the bottom line is that jobidon is is in a seriously weakened position in his reelect effort again the the latest had to holl had to head polls between trump and bidon continue to show trump with a durable leed araskmeson report poll that came out just last week shows trump up six forty seven forty one emerson has him up forty five forty four morning consult has him up forty five forty one in other words jobiden seems to be stuck in the low forties and it there is no lody can do to change that especially because again the thing that is reinforcing weakness on the world stages the fact that the present is physically weak it is he is the physical manifestation of his own policies yesterday jobidon was was facing down the stairs of air force one again and at went real porly is the short stairs sgand they stort that tryd to have load on the short stairs that ye has tour stairs to trip on whom et boom twice twicee almost trips on the stairs again e keeps falling up the stairs things are going really really well men are a porter ask jobidon if gavenuwsumis gun are placeim on h ticket and jobidon started speaking swahely or something are you ready a wook o a wooker to you we loker to you e oowol i can o to you ar i told you wi ein out on fact on orush ive a major practi o on frid ofeai roall frough a gase he is ast abact having new semne's roooooo squirrel things are going amazingly wall for him again the reality is that his vacillation is uncertainty is mothiness on policy in the foreign realm is hurting the country his wild leftism on policy in the domestic realm is hurting the country and all that comes together in the figure head of an e one year old man who is no longer sentian and trips up the stairs all this is really bat what exactly is bdin strategy his strategy's hihlay trump which means once again folks if you wish donal trump to win on i'm somebody who in a trump forso bide race which is donal trump to win if you are trump to win then he needs to ratchet down the crazy the entire campaign for jobidon is going to be donald trump is crazy yes i'm old yes i'm seenile gust my policy sucks but he is totally crazy that is going to be bi in's argument i'm not saying that bidon is saying that here i se an an reporting that yesterday president biding is ordering his campaign to get far more gressive when it comes to his likely uponit this brand new reporting trum sn ans m jal is that bidon personally instructed his top campaignates recently to spent even more time paintain trump as onm a hinge and calling out his inflamatory rhetoric tos horsis tell am ga that the thrust than bidan's instruction was to significantly ramp up the campaigns efforts to highlite the crazy as at that trump says in public an ans m jaly is at the wit saty asked ford but an't be to early on the west cost that lis m jeh yot dat i i think this reporting gives us some interesting insight in to how the president himself a personally uses his campaign trotity what i was told by sorcays is ase said a presiden bidtin in stropting personally some of his top campaign ates to is sentially even more a grassive in high liting o some of trompsomast in flamatory and wild coment again that is bidin's only strategudes the only thing that he can amply at this point which means that is incumbent on trump to say if you were things just let bidn just let him wither on the mine out there that is all that is all donal trump has to do don trumptin intervie with lord ingram last night on fox news and he saids him good things as always there is some good trump in here'e some bad trump stop providing material seuronemy's first rule opolitics do not interrupt youroponents when they are making a mistake here is what trump said hat was ood he said he wants a debate with jobite now jobin are not koantn givento bate he is not goning given debate for variety of reasons he is geen be able to say that that trump would't give anybody else a debate in the primaries which is true he is alsogoingto say thathe is not going to debate somebody who who tried to steel the election of twenty twenty after losing in who is hes now going to be con victed of crimes and and all this kin of stuff that is what bidn is going to say but trump consistently calling for debate and by running from one is a bad look for biding here is trump yes t rday on on lauras sho you challenge him to a debate regularly ims foca specific topics an other wits with not a wide ranging just one debate im for im allo i'll doit when nowan you show on chowan you rig now and i wuld can do you you can do anybody you want i i'll take anybody from te see an then which is toi very porly in the ratings by the ways you go ro in because i think you have an obligation in this case youy have an obligation to debate gate that is a good line for trump what is a bad line for trump it is for trump to discourage people from using mail and ballats again have we not learnd our lesson at this point if you are the republican party you should be encouraging your people to use mailand ballats and you thing that gets them tou vote would be the thing that you should be telling them to do donald trump told people not to vote by mail in twenty twenty and he lost if you told people to vote by mail there is a better than fifty percent chance that ou woud have won those a very close election in the swing states and republicans refused to vote by mail because donnal from told them they should not vote by mail and the proba is this even if ninety per cent to the people that is donald trump told not st vote by mail showed up on pollingdane voted ten percen did not and those votes we are never entered into the ballapox why would you do this whe re publicans tof one brout victories in places florta where the governor of the state to santhus he actul sait yaglovote by mail do at ever yo have to d devote vote legally do we need to do vote early but vote for ox that is how you win but here is nonnal trump again downgrating mail ad why why nless you'r actrigan t fight the law in the quarts and have laws change and overturned about mailand voting you have to play by the rules that are on the fields right now you cannot argoue about the rules while the game is in process that is not that is ot helpful or useful you means you are going to lose if you do that sort of stuff here is trumpripping ond mailand bauts lour is trying to save hem by the way that is lot o the interview last night as is is lor ingram trying to save trump from himself and trump being now i'm norin directly into that trad that treatets amazing that' do it if you are a mal in voting you ortomatically have frot if you have able tealint loryou ou goi yougas you do not have it when you go in to whar you voting place you go in to won an i any properly run state they look at you they cive you give votor idea you give all sorts of identifict i man it would be very hard to cheat in a masca when you send ot min ions i california think this an tha thirty six midian ballats they do not have a voting booth in the whole place and then minions of ballats come bac nobody knows way thet coming from i potwhat d n it do about it the way you win is by swamping them swamping them with what in day ballating it are not gun o work that is not hawld this works if democrats really up the anti on ballad harvesting instates where it is legal they push mailan voting they are going to win it is s th why why wh n that the same the crazy stuffle gan that is just the strategic silliness o gan that that that that makes no sense it is politically foolish incourage your own voters to vote why is the difficult tell your voters to vote however it is legal devote go vote is it not hard can but that is not aftully the stuff that that is going to to play into jobidon's argument the donal trump its a crazy person in donal trump he has many things going for him inthe selection cycle at this point namely jobidon hi's see nile namely tobidon is an awful presedent on every front namely he is in fact being persecuted by jobidons department of justice and a whide variety of other public officials whor misusing an abusing their office to target him all o that is true but it he does not have to do for example compare that to what just happen to electing ovolney agan i'm in a keepsaying this because it is true all o the things happening nonal trump are unjust and they are wrong and they are not on the order of him being taken owful plane arrested put in prison and then murdered that is not the same thing e bad they are they are different they are different version to bad and he does hee hat to tis the prob if he just said that he is being targed un fairly it be true if he was saying that it is wrong in abuse of the constitution for the deogated to it doing absolutely true why then go the extra stap of comparing yourself to a guye who as just murdered in russian prison is that helpful forget about whether it is it is true or false is it helpful an here her his trump yesterday doing this now an thit is't new york civil frad case this judge arthur and yor on world against you for act almost a h a billyan dollars plot interest that r wrong every day wor ie first tread as a eighty thousand thousand dollars a day how wul you put up that kind of money if as hv a bon to put up even if if yo apilyou got a put up at's cril monea that a an thit is a lot of i lot o nog form of novonly it is a form of i've come in is im or fashis im iv the guisin not yu i've known this for a long time and i've seit it openly i no jury kno anything on gay all that strukes up for it this is a form of the volney in really really e that unnecessary ii simpofess it th m on every other thing that he saying there it is that last step that he just cannot stop him and it is because yeouple told him not say that he says it this cretigue is meant to help don al trump's campaign it is not meant to harmint it is meant to tell people the donal trump ought to curb himself because if he does he will win and if he does not he will lose an net it is also true that much of the stuff that the media r pertraying as foolishness and craziness andall the stuff will have no impact on the race there is certain stuff that may hav an impaction han theire tuf that will not have n im pact one of thngs that is noccin to have an impack but that the mediam made a big deal out of is that over the week gends donal trumplent to something called sneaker conto now this kan of stuff it is stupid it is it is laughable but i's going a hurt trumpet anyway no is har trump goes to he goes to sneaker con and he is selling golden trump sneakers and a ino it is funny at the verily cerigo bi thic i something iv b tu en bu e twelve years ther ty years mad i think i e be biniarinfluenc ic thav be very pos e the ben reallein fluenc inc and they lovee and they love what we have done he re teis ten thes genam ock all that by you nowit is that can to havent eat negative impack on trump you rased byhe way the sneakers which were selin for te for her bux apair they sold out immediately is a thousand pairs of foure hundr gran on those sneakers now would you wear those round them all no and will they make you run faster trumphire but is that sort of stuff going to going to harm trumps campan any real way not really's the other kennostuff that that is problem for donold trum i' get meanwhile the left continues tou demonstrate it is absolute inability to deal with the emigration issue new york city is a full scale disaster area new york city is now i am getting you not they are giving migrans a debit card according it to in a coltelenas writing for the yor post maor eric atams is giving oup preepaid cashcarts to migrants and dum apparently it will give migrans up to ten thousand dollars each in tax pair money with no ide check no restrictions no fraud control wygactly give up the credicards here the debicarts the mayors offen said that they were trying to solve a problem it is that migran staying in hotels do not eat all their food and doc god these city's nobed emergency contract wor to provide migrans three meals to day throws away up to five thousand meals daily wasting seven point two million dollars a year and the idea is you give them an debicard andthey going they buy their own meals and it will save you money or alternatively if you want him ten tivised people to e legally ima great tell them theyn come to york city and get a free ten thousand dollar give for doing in the state of florta we g've a ten thousand dollar bons to cops move down here is want more cops what you think happens when give ten thousand dollar bones to people across the border illegally and things are oing well in new york tape emerged yesterday of migrans attacking

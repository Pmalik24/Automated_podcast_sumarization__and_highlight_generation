mitchel was in his twenties when he waing that his mam was getting on a blaster train twice a week and going to a place they would stick a needle in her arm and take a pin of blood and they wold keep the plasma and give her back everything else and pay her twenty five or thirty five dollars per pint in gan shou do this twice a week an she need e the cash of course that is not the kind of thing anybody wants to heare their mam has to do and it tookhim a few years but soon as ye had the money to step in and help her out mitchel told rismam do not do it any more ou n i'll just give you the money ad she turned him down do not worry about it i do not leed you to jumping dont take care of myself even if it is hugrous at least i'm not asking for anything a she loves that sing an when she say we do for to day what we cannot do for grever but's i mean tis is i is i i guess a personal proverb that she uses to trick herself in to enduring a crucible i can do it to day we made this specially har t was mitchell is in new york his mamm was on the other side ofthe country and oreagan wher he grew up and recall sometimes and her fum would be turned off and you wul have to reach in to his brothers to find out whatas happening an she needed help and then organize the help but talking toher about the blood donations hand they ad a bunch of conversations about it let mitchell toern everything about it about the munti bilding dollar companies that by plasmo from people his mam about the black doctor charles drew invented a way of separating plasmo from blood and set op some of america's first bloodbanks at the start of word or too and because we were still in sim crow they would not let black people do not at glood how symbolic is that that the black guy that evins this process that helps thes hundreds of thousands if not millions of people cannot even do not at glood mitchells a writer hes bonn a show before mitchellece jackson an's written about these conversations with his mam and the places that they let him to for instance one day he got a talking about blood and patriotism his mams takeo patriotism by the way is that anybody says my country rit aroun at what ugly thing happens here is basically just a mam she is the best in her kid n a matr what terrible thing they do and e may doring that conversation she' sprise mitchell but describing her blood donations as the most patriotic thing she does given the ched sit for the money i guess if we if we kind of think about patriotism in is best it is looking out for the next person she wous just thinking i'm giving a part of me which is sacred to binish it some one else but i think it is also too my mother is one of those people she really is the mother who will do anything shes the mother that has a hundred dollars in her account to last her the month and my brothers does not have food ins a frigeriner in she gives him aihty i in this is not a hypothetical this is a literal this is another way of giving in a mitchell as you talk that i just struck with all the things that ar bundled up in in those little pints of plasmo when you tell the story it is simultaneously your feeling of protectiveness about her and how she is doing in ta she doing o k and her wanting to be independent of you and ther also feeling she is taking care of other people tare also getting money she needs it is and tey also it is blood isical think that ther all compressed in this little plastic bag then it is both simpbolic and literal i think h t's always that way may ti us lood is of fundamental geeving us ablive something we all share what of our insides that we all have actually seen with th rigent color of a stop hine itakes on many other meanings a ways that other things in er body do not there is blood ties what feuds and bad blood betwee people and the blood of the lamb and jess blood turned wine thes the idea people who are cold blooded people are hot blooded and now discredited notion of how much of this creup's blood or that in blood yuat running through your veins to dan our brog e we dive to do all kinds of stories about blood picture please if you will right now an those a i wicated dors in the shining opening op u see a blood pouring out right here on the radio but do not touch tat bile there is much to say fthe you be easy chicago wits this american life on mor glass bloody stay with us at one started from fulbottom now were here we begin to day with a story about lirl actual blood and this joke and by theway ho was all the seven year olds in her audience why did the nurse bring a red pen to work in case she had to draw blood look at anyway somebody wrote into our show last summer saying theyad a story to tell about being a flabotomist a person whos job it is to draw blood for labtast or durnations using by the way a needle not a red pan her name is a dellevine an she said she was the worst fubottomist in her whole hospital what ar producers diam we found that entriging natually called her up and it turns aut she was a perfectly fine folbottomist but she did get thrown into the job from a different job without a lot of preparation it some of the most extreme circumstances imaginable a totalfish out of water here is ti am i liked talking to a dell about drawing blood because as a newbe she saw everything with began her his eyes she was into it she talked about veins in this way that id never heard before just ardently ye tust the vein and should fill bouncy you tust it by touching it with you ye hav i touchet and ich sort of bounce an now bys bouncing veins sho know my own veins wen now i on er hi i'll do it on the back your hand where yeh the vens in the in the front of the the therest her not for us come that don'l know iidid not got o flabotamys they just tteld me that not for us a dell did not ever study flabotamy because she is actually a physical fairbest she had no plans to ever be sticking people with needles an drawing their blod but when covid hit last spring the hospital she worked at cancelled all of her physical fair ape appointmence and started a signing people to new jobs i really wanted to work on the loading dock that was what i really wanted to de a wanted to drive one those big things around lift pallites of supplies but they did not need her there she ended up in flabatamy one of the departments of the hospital whose work did not slor down it became a total newby drafted to drb blood for the very first time in the middle of a pendemic by the way she did not ronestoname her hospital because they did not give her permission to do in interview a dell spent her first few days following different fo botomists around the hospital watching closely as they worked she was imprest to watch as they performed even the most basic tasks with incredible elegance this one flabotamis i just was always mes morized by the way she put tape on the back of her hand precisely alays exactly the exact size piece of tap another one she would hold the butterfly needle not by the wings but actually by the little berel wich just can if a harder way to hold it but she was just real gentall just the way they could draw blood from the craziest places mecause hospital patience ther sik there and organ failure there really swollen orther fains ere shod and these flebloodo ister doing crazy stuff just skimming the surface as some one's forearm an just getting this tiny little spider vain or there getting blood from the back as some ones thumbnuckle i think they'r total artist then suddenly it was her turn to try a dell flipped around her hospital badge no one could see she was he physical ter pist then went in did her first sticks that is plabotamous ling gofor blood draws in the maternity word on healthy young mothers who had big easily visible vains she made a lot of workin mistakes i would keep the to bon un till it completely filled with blood and then when i would retract the needl the blood that was left over in tha tubing would spill all over the bed and make a big maan everone was always yellin at me tha to retract the needle retract it do it do id it is ready it is ready an wut it is only half way ull just do it i my ay after about two weeks of this sort of haphazard seet to the pans training her manager decided she was ready to go in alone on her first day of working solow a dell walked in and saw that her assignment was in the icy you which at that point in april was full of covit patiencs i got panic completely panic i mean i i was nervous just i meant even just going into a covid room just would fill me wit fear terror it was not incredibly challenging assiment i see you patients where among the sickest in the hospital often with multiple ivies and swollen limbs an tilbodamy was only called in after the nurses there had already tried twice to get blood but culdin a top of that all the covid stuff the peep that made at hard to move an see not being able to bring a full cart of supplies in the pressure to work quickly and minimis exposure a dll was terrified and overwhelmed but she did her best to figure out her own little routin the beginning i always used to talk to the patience you man telli i would say mli good morning good morning this is a dell an from phlabotamiam here to drosso blood you no but there sedated or i talled on to days tuesday it is april twentieth it is a nice day outside i tell them what is on the news or what was going on and i lways tell them that they look great the they were that they were getten better i could tell how often was that actually true i hardly ever but i just felt i heard that people when there is te dated they con sill canna her eus i always felt i should say something uplifting i mean a few one a cheerlating section i mean physical therpies whereit is that iman we are omamistic as a group the dell was not doing greatad actually getting the blood though she was missing something half of her sticxs she would get ell suited up and prepared to go in the room try and try and try for ten or fifteen minutes fail then she would have to go down stairs and mark on the white board the patients that sheen mist a more experienced labotamist could be sent up to try again she felt a disappointment bumbling things up in one of the most serious and urgent parts of the hospital when they would send me to do blood cultures i would almost always botchit a blood cultur is a test for an infection in the blood my first blood culture that i got called to do when i got to the room the patient was in a full cod and they were all in their doing seepy are chest can pr ashions they were shocking him i flipped out i was all my god i was about to leve and they are no out they' you stay they you stak as if he lives we need those blood cultures i stood there i was waiting and standing next to ma e nen we are wholly dressed up in all this year was one of the hospital chaplains oh esdanding next to each other she was there becaus if the patient died she would need to go in and do last rits and i got completely wigged out by that a sort of feeling we were the the angel in the devil just standin side by side and the patient live and the hospital chaplain just flew out there you now and then i had a go in i was rattled by wlik what happened then i had to do these blood cultures jusa ike you i did not get it i did not get it remember a dells a physical tharpist nobody was dying in front of her at her old job the chaplin never hovered near by this was a totally different gae e dll's first week in the icy wo was is trustful that she thought about quitting but she did not she kept going she watched vidiowas about phlabodamy in her free time practised getting her sticks over and over lining up her tubes in the order of the dros folding gods into quarters with one hand readjusting the needle to keep the blood flowing she started to be able to see vain she could not before to dro blood from her challenging places the first time i got blood off thi skyes thum nuk call ow it just could not believe it all proud of myself ofre from a really skinny little vain and i'm just trynit i just knew ieould i could just get a sentimde er blood into the tobe that would be good enough for the lab but even being able to drow their blood well did not change her patiente outcomes lots died it got to her she says she stopped looking at their faces when she went in the room stopped chatting as whenh with them to and as she was leaving instead of telling him they looked good and she could tell they were doing better she used to she just told them good by he dell told me that dropping into this tunnel vision bod just going straight for the vain not looking around it actually made her better at drawing blood more gentle ft in the middle of the summer hree mones after a dell began drawing blood the first wave finally started to receit at her hospital then she got a tex from her physical theor by boss telling her it was time to come back i was really furious i did not want to go back o mely thit ye causlic a bit of ob i guess they could not believe it i said i was not goin to come back i was surprised to hear this given how she would felt completely inadequit for long when she was there but it felt whit blashe to her she would been thrown from her old job into this one finally felt she knew what she was doing she was not prepared to be yanked back out just as quickly it is been eight months now since a delswich back to physical therby she still notice his people's vans specially the ones on the back of their fingers those ones she told me when summones really sak those ones will stay boundsy there the last to go tyan well is one o the bruuces of show i to blood tie we turn out in this blood episode to blood relatives n the importance of famiy rmaybthe stories about the unimportance of thamwy and the meaning lessness of blood ties the sender the story or thrirty postcards and oane of our producers gave it kesset about i wont to start by saying i am one of thoe people who has never cared it all about family trees who as related to whom genialogy stuff that the only family that felt important growing up with people i saw every day my parents and sister and then can at one circle out grand parents cousins the relatives we would visit with some regularity beyond that they just seemd people i did not know and i think this is the scientist in me i aowics felt lake thewhole idea of being related by blod who cares if they have some deona that i have it altis seem kind of dumb this was a problem when some one would ask me when my family came to the united states my great grand parents i think from austria poland some from russia the various points hats felt a thing i should know just i could not look an idiot when that question came out i'd asked my parents whold tell me but thereworne a lot of details no one felt real in it and whatever my parents would tell me i'd promptly forget then a couple summers go we were visiting my aunt an uncle my kids ware running round lunatics a sitting on the couce my aunt handed me the stack of papers theye were photocopies of thirty postcards te distant family memberhad come a cross them and they were beautiful ritten in gittish an the hebre alphabet an this meticulous hand ready i could read who they were addressed to that was an english harry castonbou three twenty cherry street new york america cherry street is a street iave walked by for shore it runs under the manhatan bridge the postcrds were from his father schmwell mendill castonbou who was living in t a town in austria hungry at the foot of a small mountain the date on the first postcard nineteen o for schmwell was my great greet grandfather's brother there were translations alongside the postcards a relative had found someone who could read the old eedish i set there on the couch and started to read tagain this was not my thing i honestly did not expect ting it through them but amazingly these thirty postcards they appene to tell little story with a beginning in an end you coun glimpse a piece of a life thoug them of a man living a hundred years ago who had my last name and i know i just said that should not matter maybe am wrong they gave me a feeling i was not expecting to have the postcards are only one side of the conversation schmwell writing to his son but his son harry who as twenty four at the beginning clearly wrote back you coan tell because schmell writes things you forgot to put a stamp on your last letter and i had to pay a fine signed your father schmell i love that line because i'm not proud of this but it reminds me of me at also it warms my heart to read a guilt trip on a hundred year old postcard sent a cross an ocean you cul only wite that to some one whose famile blood gives you permission to make certain demands to be yourself in ways that maybe you should not e o want me to send you a talise to america a talis is a prayer shawl this is quite difficult postage is quite expensive and did you not by a talise for your wedding thit seems possible they wrote back and forth constantly ue i'm surprised tat you have not received my letter why do not you write about your business mine is completely in ruin and my income is very bad heres what we know about schmell when he was writing mes ho is divorce and his two kids he had not seen years harry be cause he was in america at three twenty cherry street his daughter was close at home in

me to her wedding i gave her all the money she asked for and went to the wedding she has not once witten about her situation since childhood as you well know she has become a stranger to me schwell is on a kind of mission these postcarts i seems dismayed by how scattered the family has become and he wants to hold everyone to gather somehow he wrtes about being lonely having no one to have a heart to hart talk with ue please let me know if you intend to return here with your family wor do ye want to take a pleasure trip i would be very pleased but the question is if he can do this without any trouble ind the map of our family scmell is pretty far removed he is pluto out there on a distant worbit but i felt some tug on me he asks after my great great grandfather this living near by in newark new jersey ue please write to me about my brother how is he he does not rite to me at all how are his children are they well owststruck by how consistently miserable he seems miserable but also he has not given up hope he yearns for the family wants to be with them again i wondered if it would happen when harry's first son gets a little old er scmell wrihts maybe itwuld be possible for you to send him to me and i could fulfill the commandment and teach our children and your sons children is my sons sons are as my own your father mol the're al these grand kits being born that he wants to see when harry has a daughter names here after his grandmother cmell wrights my dear son you have done very well you have added the name of my dear mother i have great joy from this but there is also this heart breaking one ue ut the ender your letter you did not send greetings from your son yitzoch which worries me very much please disclose the truth to me may we only hear good tidings he sock had died of neumonia at age one there is wone postcard wherescmell seems truly joyful mak he finally had a really good day or something september twelfth nineteen o seven the entire postcard as a blessing that he composed himself in hebrew the translater was really struck by the poetry of it may the rays of your good fortune shined on your head and may you always be a fulfilled person love and peace in your home all of you healthy and complete hour tents free of fear blessings nested in your house and success shedding its light around you but making my way through the stack o postcards one thing after another seems to go wrong he eventually does make conduct with his daughter harry's sister and visits her but he still seems worried e i hope there will be peace for some time he retes abut a fire that cost him a lot of money an deler he sends cotton wool too goes bankrupt ue business is very bad his credit has been stopped and many people have gone bankrupt thank god the fear of war is past may god bring us better times that postcard was from may twenty sevenh nineteen thirteen when i read it i was i wait what do you mean the fear of war is passed is it wore war one about to happen here is a postcart from a little later the stamp had been removed some words are missing but this part was intact te the russians plundered we went on foot therefore we took nothing with us we were a hurried we closed the house and left everything we left all our property everything was plundered and the house was destroyed may god give us strength and hard in our body is this our fat

senior editor coming out one o the greatest appointments of fae blood in the history of fake blood also fixing a human blood pomp and if fi bood speaks in english that is in a minute chicaga bubble gradio wen our programm continues tis meric an lie from our glast to day's programm bloody feelings stories about blood in all its liquidy meanings blood is metaphor blood is the actual staff moving through our veins we arrived at at through ocheu at three stage right this is condition it is called vezo vagel sinkapy is pasically fainting in re action to certain stimuli strigered by all kinds ofthings exposure heat stress and the side of blood i turns out that the blood he does not even need to be real blood to get that response one of our producers been out of wunme remembers one bloody shakespeare production that at its height had scores of people fainting night after night here is been i can see thousand in sakes i was a year out of youniversity trying very haunt to be awritea and working at a bookshelp in centural london i was also almost alwaysburg brk in fact that i do not think i could affold more than one visit to see a westen show the entire year what i did do a lulze of the was a reade theater reviews two thousand in sakes was the year of michael sheen and franklangella in fros nixon it was ha year avenue cue came to the west en the year of wicked's london dabew and all i could do was dream of going to see them naturally the review page was the first place i read about a play thate was getting ray reviews thate was apparently grisly bloody audience members were fainting the play was one of shakespeare's least loved plays tightus angeronicas three hours of muscular bloody theatr that as one audience member quoted in the paper put it had people dropping flies it was thrilled at the idea of theater being powerful enough to fell even sturdy london theatergoers i was jealous i wanted to go i wanted to see if i could withstand it in the fifteen years since i've often thought about the source of that production's power about the blood and tey at wont what we had forty three people once o forty three people fanted forty three that was our lax all these years later i was thrilled to talk to the director lucy bailey because i wanted to understand how she done something extraordinary once i came ats the auditoria land the ushesa aall a school girls came and they all fainted and thee all in this box we put them all up there iloo to the ou no always the very pale gars all city ig i fainted ll taken out i sursaye the ushers when i came a se shoter and and how many people to day just to be clear no one fell and hit their head or got seriously injured they were simply overwhelmed lucy just had not foreseen the fainting to give you a picture the globe is an open air theatre a mostly faithful recreation of shakespeare's original which is under half of its audience standing close to the action on the stage and the globyes used to fainters combination of standing and the sun probably during titers when a person fainted the ushers would wine through the crowd with an unfolded wilcher and then take them out of the arena later in the run tere was a saint john's ambulance park near by it is not surprising the blood in contactst and inquantity is inescapable and it is supposed to be tita santeronicas is one of shakespeare's earliest plays and ther's a lot of young man's swagger mixed in with the poetry of the writing set in ancient rome the play was written to speak to some of the fascinations of the elizabethan era it is about war and revenge and an over the top grief that clouds good sense and moderation innocence get slan brutes revel in their savagery blood is shed in really horrible ways richal sacrifice slit throats mutilations sexual assault plossa memorable cannibalistic pie it is ta play thats trenched in blood and it often gets written off as a flurry of unsubstantial blood lettings because of that tbue lucy knew the blood matted to the play one of the first things she had to figure out was had to make the blood look real in an ironic twist to make the blood look the real thing they had to fake it if you see a lot of stage blood it it often does not feel very reall even if it is quite accurate the color of blood but blood is quite right and somehow that bright blood in in theatr torms makes go o yea yer that is just such a sea tor blood wa said look how we would make it unreal in order to make it or real and other wos we garcld the blood lucy also had to figure out how to make the blood move it would deliver the most impact she turned to another experd the fight director you talk to here about if your wounded in this way howdes ablot the have thus were toes the blood har whys it coming out o the callof tebaus why is it caria those what is what is a jearney if the blood for tamera who the audience love to hays there is a very careful spurt of blood when she gets a giant fork in the gloods twhen tightus loses a hand thete was more than one source of blood a spurt from a syringe nd then a slower ooze out of his arm to make the intense experience more immercive lucy and her designer build dudley focused on the space itself they wanted to make it feel oppressive make the audience parti ipate in the blood sport the achieve this by giving the globe a temporary valarium roof which reduced the sunlight and created shadows and then they feel to the space with incense they moves some of the action off the stage and into the crowd to create a sort of theatre of chance the idea was to make it feel a temple of death they have to strike a delicate balance too little blood an atmosphere and you do not bring the audience along too much and it feels a parady yet ik a huge contract as yet between the audience ans he play and the players that the audience given any charts want to believe as long as you do everything to suspend there their disbelief then you you yo you keep that contract but as soon as you break that contract and do something that shows them wene the canic or overacts overplays your cards overeggsit too much blood or or ungi sit to little blood at the moment where they goin sorry i do not believe that and one of the places they decided to under play happens in the very first blood letting in the play when titers sacrifices alarbus it happened very quickly wit how we did it we cho and it war fast and then they saw that a the blood and they then then wete pudding him they do not have tile to dwell he did a very deliberate sail we really was shocking with it the audience sees a flash of red and then he is gone almost immediately maybe the blood made them faint but it was not just the fact of it that cause them to fall it was what was happening between the people on stage the feelings they were experiencing one of the most shattering momence in the play comes after levinear attacked and mutilated is brought to her father and unrapet the dark viscers blood seeps through the bandages at her stumps and pause slowly from her mouth heven titers a warhardand general whose don his own share of killing is reduced in that moment to an anguished and helpless father his precious daughters still bleeds and he cannot stop that that bleeding to have your live's blood bleed or your kill or the blood that is your blod and to see it bleeding ants to understand how those wulds were amay is is puschious the brayn to puint or ladness as titers himself says in that scene it was my dear and he that wounded her have hurt me more than had he killed me dead thets o o a girl who still alive but bleeding and that an causes much internal bleeding to her father both o the heart and the bray in a way he suffers a king o bray an bleed the entire play is tih together by that ribbon of grief parece lose children brothers turn on each other innocent bystanders are collateral damage and all the blood is in the service of that rure feeling the language is hysterical and violent and it goes on for five long acts the audience gets pulled into the hysteria because they have little choice by the half way point inact three theye far gone that they drop at the idea or violence we use to have people fainting on a word wheneer caman said that he wanted want of them to chop off they had you could alwayst guarantees tat somebody would faint when he said chop when errand says the word here tdheres no actual chopping happening he is just saying it but it was enough you coul see the audience sto the gird themselves and then he say chop and one sombody would go one of the things ie is c urious to tok to lucy about was how wit felt to be the architect of all this feeling what was it to do this to an audience again and again have to be honist was completely filling we we have not expecteds thes response or jis tend not to be vocal this kind of fainting was a sort of sign of audience involls them testing i think the whole effect to see the astonishing effect o had on people to the extent hf people was sick they fainted that even uminated thet lost control of the the whole body was to do it this cumulative feeling combination os thins wot just one thing it was such a i formation that something about the play was worthing eight years after that thist production and two thousand and fourteen lucy revive titas andronicus at the globe it was a different cost and once again audiences flocks to see this difficult bloody play this time thet the ordiers did not faint as much i mean they really did not and yet everything we did was i think palpably the same if not better e and i think that was because people came psychologically prepared it was very much harder to get that that tha contracts going that your involved o s see youaregoing to face moten theatre is mostly a quiet affair polite applause gentle chuckles usually when people leave a play in the middle of the performance is because it is bad they not feeling will they suppose to be feeling wet tites thit were checking out because they were feeling too much be mater wen me is one soersho that for there is no us in uderis o we about thirty million americans have fibraries and if you doft now what this is fibraryes are these muscular tumors that grow onor in the uderis we doft knowhat causes them why they ffick people of color at higher rates specially black

of benign li they do not turn into cance her but they cost problems pain discomfort and then this the blood which of course is what our prigmis bhat to day fibraries can make periods heavier a longer or more erratic factors can be dismissive surgery's expensive an carries ris and even after surgery fibraries can come back new ones ten a pattac went back and forth about getting surgery her fibrary did not bather hr at first but of a time it grew bigger and cause mortimore discomfort and she began to think about her fibrary carus partner making her life miserable she ven imagine confronting the fibrary andyou know the relative safety of a therapis offus with the question should we stay together she made this into a won act pray starring three characters women f fibrary and therapist and we

flowing inside of us and to somebody ustrobat istimature that machine works well producer john call talk to this man and also watched im work wonning if you are squeemish about he was insides the stoy has a lot of that my favorite fun fact about blood is that it has a protenin it that is also found in eggs albymen something about that just strikes me as poetic the complex machine of the human body and a thing it eats for breakfast sharing the same ingredient i learned about this fact from the heart surgeon doctor john elefteriotis or doctor e about five years ago i drove up to yale newhavan hospital and talked with him about this one techniqy employs tall deep hypothermic circulatory arrest a k a the deep freeze often he has to do such radical plumming work on the heart and its arderies that his teem cools the patient's body down to sixty four degrees fairin height and then warms them back up again afterwards he compares it in one way to making egg lemon soup you do not want the egg to curdle and at curdles when the cook is in a hurry it has to simmer at a very low level in order not to curdle well that is because of the albioman in the egg and the bloodstream is full of albiumen that if we warm too fast we will basically yet scrambled eggs n the bloodstrin gros that is catestrapic warming takes one hour we have to warm very slowly that is long as ar heeting bet is no more than ten decrees warmer than the blood the blood wall curdle we wall catc scrambled eggs doctor es an expert on the steep frees method he is been described is one of the best doctors in the country a giant of cardio thorasic surgery when we met in two thousand fifteen he would been at yale for more than thirty years and in about seven thousand open hard operations ot that point who may be three hundred transplants he dramatically length in the lives of the jas musician day bruwbeck and the writer robert ludlum for long time he did one major operatien and then may be one smaller procedor almost every week day he offered to let me watch him perform the deep frees watch him take a patient and literally suspend their animation it is what cooling them down does there not dead but they show no signs of life any mark that he could reach hinto their body dis connect te gruchal organ and fix it with his hands it is he is a m aster illusionist fooling death with this highstakes version of misdirection i was ya giimen i was thinking what we we a the soundewe open in a breastbon wi i e a interesting for ithe procedure i observed was a three hour aordic graft and valve replacement itstretchd i got to the or early about seven thirty in the morning on a thirsday all gowned up with a mask and scrub hat the team was already crepping the patient for sedation doctor e and i stood several yards away in the corner he could go over the case with mat the patient had an aordic anurisen yeu may know i did not the aord is the largest argery in the body and shaped a candycane ches an anurism just means the part of it with a curved part at the top in this case had become swollen it stretched a balloon filling with air it the wall of it was toothin eunlike many other diseases does not have any symptoms unti it rupturous a first symptom as usually rupture or death tt tat seems its more than a sympton yes it is it ta conclusion o ets a conclusion that is for wall state of yet the patient was still awake at this point eyes wide open listening to one of the anasteseologist he had a brown mustache and a burgat looked nervous leaning toward afraid bithin minutes he was unconscious and they were painting his naked body all over with an iodine base haped his eyes shut then they swaddled him completely in plactic and blue surgical sheets which made the whole thing feel much more impersonal doctor e seems to care a lot about his patients but this is when i began to understand how autumotive his work is managing the proper function of this motor with its valves and chambers and sparks propelling a person's blood finally they made the first incision ner opening him up eyees opening a ceneral ardery down i te aovus l let an ductor he was right the sound of them sawing open the breastbone was i guess we can go with elari then they inserted the chest separator slike a reverse vice instead of squeezing things together it spreads them apart while i watched on a walmonider the circulating nurse pady laphond came over and explained to me that they were slicing open the para cartium wit as kind of protective sack around the heart and it came at that extrabit of packagin and is that is that the liver no that big ar that is the long wile almos tet expana in contracti with breth she was right i watchd the lungs exspand and contract with this placid rhythm that made me think of ocion waves rolling in and out it was earthly and it was familiar and then things get a lot more intense owe cret owe olwy loks e bloy titing tissue cutting tissue a en a sort of a cushing alung to the let o o i broken true tu the heart which is peeting it sort o jumping a fish and his chest an angry fish trying violently to escape but even that is too terrestrial a description for what this looked it looked alien a creature an a siphi movy with no familial relationship to humanity it was startling almost frightening and i will never forget it to think that same thing e sentiulate i's also in sight of me and doctor e and all of you and everyone but when you see it be think that thing is not to be trusted just then doctor e asked me if i wanted to come up top yes an and on to the stool just behind the blue drape that separates the steril area where they were operating from the rest of the rhen i was standing almost exactly above the patient's body looking down into it and being that close this fellog i was looking at something fundamental an ancient and i felt this is not something irregular smuck me is supposed to see if your gots are exposed and i'm there it usually means something is gone really wrong tan realize that hearts were big o her i try to convey in the different rigtins for the general pubblic as the beauty the bod the ontrul ho yor the bd i just tak fy breath o way every single ta mony i do not think ide is to sirst word i would a shot a in ta a this is not the most beautiful a they hook the patient up to something called the heart lung machine the big part of these proceedures is outsourcing the work of the heart in the lungs to this big boxy kind of robod with rotating drums in it this is how thy pull off the grain illusion tricking the body into operating without the heart they send the patient's blood to the machine it oxygen nates and pressurizes the blood and lso cools it and then sends a back to the kidneys and the liver and the lungs all the organs and you concee we ma picula se a o fall fubbles ec bubbles e cas a stro rubbles from the blood yet bubble o ere and the blood we re move om all very careful are you see now on at the heart is collapsed be carse we have taken all the blood out doctor et clamps off the aorde of right above the an yourits of you are a tra that takes the heart out of the circuet they also send a super cold er paralizing fluid to i t called retro brad for retro for short the heart is not even trying to contract any more now the patients vital signs of amost totally seized no pulse of course because his heart is not beating very little brain activity but looks this particular patient is not as bat off as otherse they do not end up having to cool them all the way down to sixty four degrees when they do that it means zero brain activity no signs of life whatsoever and when the patients that cold they actually turn off the heart lung machine which means no blood float to the brain no oxygen under those conditions it is a race against time they have forty five minutes to an hour to operate efor the brain starts to die meanwhile this patient's heart it has been beating for more than sixty two years anc before he was born is still most of us when our heart stop it will mean theire never going to start again and that 'll hapen to this gy eventually too of course but this ist just a time out for the heart a break to think of it as a miny vacation after a lifetime of constant labor in the pump house os openi theeorder you are looking inside sho av you conseive ta cavernous thimensions are vary order there we could give it a zipot now they set about the actual mechanical work there in their dedo first they replaced the aortic vowve is all calsify and then they swop out the ulgy part of the aorda with the synthetic tube and after about two and a half hours they are retty mu done and it is time to bring the patient back to life doctor e calls for the official d arring maneuvers that is evacuating any excess air out of the heart before they let it fill back up again with lod and suddenly it is hes a movy director on set complete with lots of industry terms i did not understand let a little blood flo throug the heart run fom retro for dearing and will take a haf ta n a stasa valsalvas are deep breaths the anasteseologist can actually control the motion of the patient's lungs next doctor e neens to un clampthe awarda to put the heart back in the circuit lo flo for the clamp we are a rak ank back up slo we asae down retro of all the flo to you red on green

point six degrees no scrambled alpinen anothe hart o startin te it av a sfe ot ovation at this point the patient's heart the violent thing i was afraid of in the beginning is much more docile whit is more a big chicken breast to me now doctor e says tha probably means i'm getting hungry which i was i'm not some one who tends to seek out intense experience sas not really adventurous i don dream about travelling the faraway placeas but looking inside of another human being that watching a group of people openama thits what is wrong and closhes him again felt as unusual and unlikely as

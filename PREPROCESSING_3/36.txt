last night cent com as well as a bunch of other foreign countries parvant american allions struck at targets in yemmin they struck the hoothes the hoothees are a rag tag group of terrars who have taken over a large swath of yemmin after a massive sivil war between the hoothies and the sauties over control of the country the aranians been funding the hoothies for years and years and years will get into the history of what exactly happened with the hoothes suffice it to say the reason that all of this is happening right now is because the hoothes decided that they were going to try to ackd as an eraniun proxy arm and generate support four oron by attacking israel and then by more largely attacking shipping in the red sea now shooting off a few rockets or missiles at israel to get down by american ships or by the sauties that releten't hawe much an impact on world opinion our on the world at large but attacking ships in the red sea absolutely does according two cent com the hoothes have carried out at least twenty seven attacks on commercial ships since mid november between december sixteenth in january forth according to the welstery jurnal us navy said it had shot down sixty one missiles and drones fifteen hundred cmmercial vessels had safely cross the red sea but the biggest problem with the hubbub in the red sea and in the babel mandub straight which is where huge percentage of the world's oil supplies travel through and a huge per cent of shipping generally travels through that straight shipping is down dramatically according to sea and besee just a couple of days ago rates for freight travelling from asia to northern europe more than double to above four thousand dollars perforty foot equivalent unit its container asia mediterranean prices climed to over five thousand one hundred dollars percontainer some carriers had announced rates above six thousand dollars perforty foot container your talking bat in some cases a doubling of cost race from asion a north america's east coast have rison by fifty five per cent westcost prices clime sixty three per cent few the supply chan botemixs creed by covid basically this group of pirates in an attempt to generate support fort oron among the arab street in the middle east they have basically created massive cost four american and western consumers and they have shot down large swaths of world trade now ye have aight ninety per cent reduction year over year in traffic through the red sea from the prior year while all of this drove last night an allied attack on certain resources in yamand controlled by the hoothies it was a telegraphed punch meaning this entire exercise was designed to deter the hoothes not designed to actually kill or destablize the hoothes who in fact as a wesay our terrors group that governs a large swath of part of yemmin the reason to telegraph the attack is to allow oranians to get their military forces out of the way as not to provote in that provoke some sort of escallation with aron more directly because of corse ron has lost o forces on the ground helping out the hoothies in yemmon according to the wallstr journal that ouus ledcolishion lanch more than a dozen strikes on hoothy rebel targets in yemmon two days after the emony rebel force to fight an ultimate him to halt its attacks on ships transiting the red sea with a bragh of missiles endrones those strikes were conducted by the united states andbrish forces th re supported by australia bahrain canada and the netherlands now the sauties they said that they were concerned about the escollation butletsto be real about this bohraine works very closely with the souties borain would not have joined this coalition or allowed it to air space to be used for an attack this without the go ahead of the souties the colition strikes early friday morning local time targeed rade our systems air defen systems storgean launch sites for one way attack unmanned aerial systems cruse missiles and bollistic missiles said us sentral command a u a sommarine several destroyers an jod fighters part of the usas dwhite d isand aur aircraft carriers stripe group took part according to a us defense official wo the officials reported explosions in the capital of yamen which is called sana and the provinces of hodadasada domar and elsewhere they blaim thi on the american zinist british aggression a gainstyammon israel did not take part in tese attacks thill obviously israel does have aircraft that are capable of taking part in attacks this son a hoost the hoothes missile in ventories dattack on vessels were launch from the port of hodata according to shipping executives presient bi an immediately issured statemens had tese targeted strikes are clear message the united states in our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personel or allow hostile acked ars to imparel freedom of navigation in one of the world's most critical commercial routes and will not hesitates to direct further messurs to protect ar people and the free flow of international commers as necessary meanwhile the britsh prime ministery shee soonac said the royal air fors participated in the strikes also because quote th united ckingdom whill always stand up for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade for british tiphlo jet fighters targeted hoothy drone base in north western yemmon and in airfield used to launch cruse missiles over the red s what early indications are that the hoothies ability to threaten merchantshipping has taken a blow the hoothies of corse say the're not going tobe detur becaue the way this works in the midle east is that you have basily terrorist groups that provoke airresponsefrom an overwhelming power they get their assids absolutely kecked and then they claim thet just because they survive they one that iswhat is curnently going on nthe gosi strip commass provokes a gigantic is raily militar response the largest is railly military response to any attack since nineteen seventy three and te get their asses absolutely handed to them and most of their fighters killed an most oftheir leadership killed and then if they are breathing at the end of it they claim victory the hoothies are playing the same game it is it is really honestly cowardly sort of stuff nossar all deen omer a hoothy official told the walstertural this is a brutal aggression i love this it is brutal gression honestogod if america and its allies once commit quo what brutal aggression against the hoothies at this ci would not be alive to talk about it to the wl undoubtedly pay its price will mot waver in our stands to support the palistinian people regardless of the cost after the colition strikes the us had not seen any direct ritaliatory action directed toward us are other colish members in the redsy and again the strikes came with a lot of warning one week ago the us brittan key allies it issued an ultimatum sang stop it and then they did not stop it and then on ers day bidin conveni his natuoral securityteene to discuss the options and then despite coliion warning the hoothies fired in antishopbalistic missile that fell into the water within siht of ommercial vessel now the hoothies new that the united states and italies were going to strike all of these targets and stheyad relocated some of their weapons and equipment and fortified others the question is whether this is going to detur further action from the hoothies the answer is probably not when you telegraph punches this it is very unlikely if that is going t convinced the hoothes to stop what they are doing the allies for their part they put for ad a statement explaining what they were doing hes a joint statement from the governments of the united states oustralia bo haraden bellgum candida denmark germany italy japan netherlands new zealand republic of carea singa por and the united kingdom to recognizing the broad concentus as exprssed by forty four contries around the

shipping and naval vessels attacks on vessels including commercial vessels using unmanned aereal vehicls small boats and missels including the first use of antishibolistic missils against such vessels aure directs threat to the freedom of navigation that serves as the bedrock of global trade in one of the world's most critical waterways hes attacks threaten innocent lives from all over the world and constitute it significant international problem that demands collective action nouarly fifteen per cent of all global seaborn trade passes through the red sa including eight per cent of global grain trade twelve per cent of seaborn traded t oil eight per cent of the world's liquified natural gastrade international shipping companies continue to rerat thei vessels around the cape of good hope adding significant cost and weeks of delate to the livery of goods an ultimately jepardizing te movement of critical food fuel an humanitarian assistancs throughout the world but our message now be clear say the alles we call for te immediate and of tese illegal attacks and release upon lawfully detaind vessels and crews the whoo these will bear the responsibility of the consequences should they continue to threat en lives the global economy and the free flo of commerce in the regions o critical waterways remain committed to the international rules bay storteranar determined to hold maline actrs accountable for unlawful seisures and attacks now part of this is directed at the hoothes part of it is directed at aran because aran actually did sease another ship just yesterday and part of this is directed ta china tbecause china obviously has a very large interest in a tiwanese election that is about to happen over there the tiwanese election all the parties involved are not interestede in reunifying with china but their some parties thete are litte bit more appeasement oriented tor china the reason te united states cares about this is because tas am sea is the largest sophisticated microchip producer on planet earth their sophisticated microchips are in all t americas military tec ninety two percent of ulsophisticated microchips on planet earth the super conductors those are created in tiwan right now there is a military refusal by tiwan to give that sort of tecnology to the chinese is one of the reason the chinese militaries significantly less sophisticated and developed than the united states military word those microships be made available to the chinese not only would if facilitate invasion of tiwan t would also directly threaten the united states because suddenly the military capacity of the chinese would be ratically increased what is happening right here is if the chineses look an they see that global shipping could be threatened by again a group of poverty stricken pirates in yemmen then they would tate to themselves oke what sort of damage can we do with a weak wast in the tiwan tray were a huge percentage of the world's trade is located in the south china sea an what exactly could we do they culd projecthe eratically to the straight to malockwere nearly one hundred percent of lobal trade has to pas through china is looking on and they are seeing whether western weakness would allow again for a bunch of not in samely well equip pirates terras to hold up all of global trade and double supply chan prices and sos very important that the west did something about this just on a practical level now on the moral level th who these ise fom the worst people on planted earth in legitimately evil awful group the who these are neronian proxy group aran as we have explained is a terror sponsor it has its tentacles all over the middle east it has a tenstacles in arock obviously where the have had significant impact on the government of rock theye their tentacles in sereo are their allied with bashar asad they have their tentacles in lebanon where they effectively control the government vhe ahisballock they ave their tentacles in cammass thyhave their tentacles in palistonian is lemiccehad tand theyhave their tentales with the hoothies thus tentales are all over the middle east now one of big probems that are on historically has had is that aran is sheea and a huge percentenge ofth iddle east is souni and because of that there is not a lot of solidarity between the shea and the suny the reality is that watever the hatred is for the jewish state in the midaliest the hatred for israel that is mostly aside show between the ongoing wars thet hve been happening between shea and sunei over the course of pass several decades amultipol mor arabs and persians have been killed in a variety of wars since the nineteen eighties than anything thats happened with regard to the jews and all the hatred of the juws does is it allows for the possibility of some sort of cross cultural communication between shia and suni in the iddle east nd that iswhat the who these are trying to jurenathere trying to rally support to the uranian siide in any sort of shei souni conflict by ciding with the palistinians because one of the things that is happen is that the palistinians being incredibly radicalized population that literally no arab state will take in not only will no arab statestake in the palistinians arab stateshave expelled the palistinians before in the aftermath of the golf war two hundred of three hundred thaousand palistinies worksfell throm coate becaue they sided with sedom who saine in his war against coate in the first gulf war none of the arb states are interested in taking in the palistinian population and the commosnecs went over toaron and they work to deal where ron became one of their chief suppliers and it turns out that the sounistates they have no interest in working with the palstonians g and very radicalized populations thee stablized virtually every recime they have come into contact with by the way this wy you are seen jordan right now issuing these very loud statements because they are deeply afraid of their own population seventy per cent of jordan is palistinian and they are fraiht that their kingdom will be overthrown this dold not be the first time they ad feared this hovis thin the early nineteen seventies jordan expelled tens of thasans of palistinians tbecause of threats of over throwing the regime in wha was alled black softember the basic idea here is that if you are aron and you are seeking to by legitimacy with the arab street you polarize the region around the palistinians becaus wht you say is look all tese arab states hey will not make piece wof the israels they can side against us but the real enemy is the uden the real enemy is the jds and if we all remember that there may be will not have any abrahamicuords and aron of course hates the abrahamiquorts because it makes them a more minor player in th mddle east tot creates in overwhelming colition of force that exists around its borders that is the whole purpose ofthe comasitac it is why the emone who these are now involved in it in a fight that really has nothing to do with them because again this it all being directed from above by aron llget'st more in this in just one second

as i say just tha that group them the worst people in the world their literal slogan i can you not sick on teir bumper stickers or something if they had bumper stickers on their goats they are their literal slogan is quote ala who ocpar death to america death to israel cursed be the jews victory to islams little long and does not rhyme but a pretty much sise it all at's vrety strong slogan thet rally hiding the ball there but it turns out that their hatred is not chust against america and israel and the udan their hatred also is for their own children because apparently about one third of the entire hoothy military force is under age they use child soldiers regularly bythe way not ararity aranus to use child soldiers in the aronoroc war the aranian regime famously gave golden keys two kids and senthem out to the battle field the keys were supposed to unlockd the gates of heaven is they real thing that happeneing the aronoroch war by ther commas uss child soldiers all the time westerners do not understand how people woare non western fight they do not understand this but this a reality in the mideleast it is a reality in afgannistan by the way remember recently we talked with thim kennedy s a green bray teres nothing more dangerous than an eleven year old with an a ay and an if if you are westerner what are you have een talking bat a leving role with an a k but when you actually recruit children into your army that is what you get the hoothies havebeen doing this for years according to veoa news tyemmens hoothy rebels are still recruiting children into their military ranks to fight in the countryes grinding civil war by the ay hundred of thousands people been killed in the civil war once again demonstrating the world does not give any bleaps at all about dad muslem long as other muslims are killing them zero bleaps none zip zilch two who the officials told the a p the rebels recruited several hundred children including those as young as ten over the passtumonts they'v been deployd to front lines as part of a build up a force is taking place during a uan broke or truce tho you and doing monument to work this back in june of twenty twenty two the hoothies have used what they call saercamps tot eseminate the religious ideology and to re croup boys to fight by ther commasas exactly the same thing in the gosestrip exactly the same thing s when you see by the way statistics from the gosstrip put out by commasr says how many women and children are killed the designation of children meaning in the west would be anyone under the age of eighteen that includes a bunch of people who are in fact commass operatives tbecause they start them real young in the gods does mean everone is being killed obviously tis a member of comas or commass operative but israel is being very very meticulous about who they are killing and a lot of the people that they are killing unfortunately are in fact miners whohav been recruited into the ranks of terrorous groups by terras because teras do not have your moral standards they thinktat your morality is stupid they take advantage of it the yemony conflict of course therupted in two thousand fourteen that is when the hoothies descended from their northern oncliv and they took sena and a sowty led colition enter the war in early twenty fifteen and this brings up exactly what jobidon did ay what is happening right now the quite the only question is to western strikes on the hoothies is whether those are sufficient to detur the who thes from continuing the're paratical activity in the red sea andthe babel moundob straight now all the talk bot aron getting directly involved in the war or escalating into a larger war with the united states the'l be the dumbesthing aron ever did the way that the aronian molles are thinking right now is where about five minutes from developing a nuwclyar weapon at which pont were untouchable why would we get in a shooting war with t most powerful military force in the history of the world that be the dumbest thing theyever did right now a lot of what is going on is trying to uphold the credibility of their supposed commitment to commoss an they made a commintment to comas tha deon a bacamas commoss ten succseeded beyond its wildestreams on o tomber seventh theyre getin teir asses absolutely handed s them in the gossistrip and what you see is aronians other arounds other proxies cisbalaw the hoo thies you are seeing then do these stort of low level attacks a gainst israel and it to allies in the region in an attempt to establish credibility with the arab street or the muslen street en that iswhat that is but they do not want to provoke a general war im meun again if aron provoke general war itwould be the worst thing they ever did by the way unlike a rock during their rock war there certainly people o wanted arise up against an om who sanes regime the biggest problem with ron is the iarch see which is a generalize terrors group that is the that is the aronian revolutionary guard courd their gian army but the actual population aron significantly more moderate and significantly more modernized than the population of a roc for example again none of thisis ha case that we should get into a war th oron the pointers that aron does not want us to get into war with ron which is why were gon to back them down the only question is whether the actions of jobidon by effectively and hitting empty buildings is's going tobe enough to back the who thes off or whether the united states an it is allige gan have to escalate this thing far enough that the whoo these actually backdown are egan have to threaten to destroy the hothes in order to back them down all of this by the way coud have ben prevented all this god ve been prented an in fact none of this happen while for a temple don al trumplass precedent why we will ay beis because jobidin is a weakling on forgn policy weakness on foreign policy breeds ag gression a gression reeds response thies the typical pattern in western forin policy the west has will go hanto we do not want anything to do it this or dits gen a move out and then something in gress have happens that hurts american intrests an than america pass to respon if america respons harshly enough suddenly enough sometimes the water s school but if america does not respond harshly enough that breeds a response by the other side americaskd asklite that is the problem the question here is whether this particular response will be enough to back the whoo thes down i somehow doubted w'll

created by jobidon's idiotic foreign policy when robergade said that that jobidon had never made a good form policy decision that is about right that is about right undo a couple flashbacks here back in twenty twenty you will recall that donald trump authorized the killing of an aranian terror official am casemsilymony he was one of the mast or mind to petty much all of uron's terror wings all around the globe and he travel to a rochs who was not inside oron and who was killed an aroch and jobidon who wis runng for president to the time gave this response to the killing off cossemsoly money which again was a way for the trumped ministration to tell the aronians stop facilitating terror if you keep facilitfacilitating terror ou never know your head might be in a different place from your body to morrow morning when a comes to jup but youre was jobin's respons of the time not chom does not have en the make it clear does not have the authority to go to war with the ran without concressional congressiona authorization without working wit congress it is not optional it is nt a noptional part of his cob presidento notification o congress about the need exercise wor powers can not be satisfid ind two hundred eighty characters orless and no cresedent should ever take the united states to war without securing the for consent of the american people to first vall thi is idiotic when he said ot the killing o casemsolmony was not taking america to war in aron and as we will see this is now common talking point against the united states end its allies insuring freedom of shipping in the red sea but this was bidon's angle on ron from the very beginning and in fact one of the very first things that debide administration did when they entered office one of the very first things in the first month of his ad ministration is tha d listed the who thes as a global terrorst organization af going to pbs dot orgt this is february six teenth twenty twenty one the bidn administration officially lifted the designation of the uranian back thothes in yemin as a globel terrorist organization that nnouncement came within a largereview of the os relatinship with sauturebit you' remember the jobidin came ant offices ripping the souties and praising muranians at worked out amazing in the iddlelies slow crap for this dolt on january eleventh twenty twenty one the trump administration opposed that terrorism sanctions on the hoothies as a group this omery seran reporting to limitany humani terrian fallowed they broudly extempted eight groups to agriculture medicin et cetera but the washington tdo se expert class think tankers journalists the hill democratic operatives always consedered anything trum did illegitimate they said they were oing tiverse course robert malley who that hired operataives who liteally answered to the aranian regine was put in charge of america's uron policy tony blinkon at his first press availability the secretary state on january twenty eighth twenty twenty one he was asked which trumpad ministration policies from the last severale months ho was going to prioritize reversing he said that getting rid of sanctions on the hoothies was quote the priority he said quot the hoothese control territory i bely contains about eighty percent of emins population we wont make sure that any of tese steps including the designation do not ake what as already and incredibly difficult task even more difficult that is the provision of humanitarinate to the people of yemman cay then bidan officials suspended terrorsm sanctions on the hoothies january twenty fifth they announced revoking them february fifth within days the hoothies started wanching maske murders of yemine civilians an attacking sabuarabia then they said they they tried to fut their way out of it buteventually they just releaset the terrorism designation on february sixteenth it s that was a move that was made overtly by the bidan administration hitewas a thing they wanted to do meanwhile you recall jobiding took a very antisouty position with regard to yemmen because pushd by his left the idea was that backing the soudies in their war against the hoothies was more trouble than it was worth and the way to create a humaniterian peace in the middle east was not to low the saldeas to continue to fight the hoothies the hothies by the way literally in slave people they brought back slavery i'm not getting you that is a real thing they did an jobidan at this time he was too busy worrying about homean mohammed been solmon was the crown prince of saduarabia this is back on february fourth twenty twenty one realso stupin up war de plomacy and the war in yemmen war which is created oumene terriators totigi catastrophy the swore has tin in t underscor commimen iy all merc sporifesvoperat warneme including relemen urbsils that woked own amazing it turns out that defanging the souties in the face of the hothies that worked out great you mean oppeasemen of terrorism tolsn't work there is a shock meanwhile sam bide dinistration trying to force israel to a piece terrace in the polistinian authority ame it is unbelievably stupid all this is unbelievably stupid and entirely preventable the maff in th mdeleast is very s imple power is the operative concept if you do not have it you will loose weakness appeasment is showing your neck and that is what jobidon did the white house showed its neck to the hoothies and the hoo thees decided t take a bite meanwhile oran continues to ask calate according to the walstreturnal the oronian navy said it had seized an oil tanker off the coast of oman that has been at the centere of dispute between t taharon and washington raising the stakes as a you us led coalition wanch strikes on rebel targatinaman aronback who the rebels from yemin have repeatedly targeded the waterways of course apparently aron's navy identified the boarded tanker as a greek managed ship called saint nicolas the tanker was impounded in retaliation for the theft of oil by the american regime according to the oranian army moranian stamedia showed oronian commandos landing on the shipstack from tae military hellicopter not's a little but more complex because that particular vessel which was use to be known as the swizreshon it is charters played guilty to charges filed an yos court thad it actually carried sanctiond oranian oil the company was fined it is aronian oil cargo was seized the vessels have idle off the cost of tecas for months because federal prosecutors were trying to figur out who exactly would be willing to off load the oil eventually the justice departmen eventually contracted help to fulfil its forfeiture action but securi the annalis in former yos officials said the case suggested u s efforts to detur aranian aggression were failing a spokes person for the ronian mission at the u ens had quote the ronian army seizure of the oil tanker is not constitute a hi jacking rather it is a lawful undertaking sanction by a court order and is in response to the theft a varan's very own oil sope again what is going tobe enough to push aron off the ball is the big question meanwhile the left is just mad about this because the left is fully on the side of the worst people on earth literally the worst people on earth there are no worse people than the hoothies there truly o comms and th hoothies the same commas icis and the hoothies effectively the same these a the' some different agenditems but in terms of the level of evil no distinction what isoever the yor times says that this leads to the possibility of a broater conflict the broader conflict was already there i noticed when all the prices started up caue they shut down in actual shipping hub i love then your times it is not broughter conflict when the whothies are shutting down globel shipping n everbady has to reroud around the cape of good hope that is not thet's non a problem the problem is when you try to stop them from doing that is it it again e even the much of anti isral sentiment is extrajist anti western antie american sentiment much of it is if america defends itself that is the offensive that is going to lead tascalation of isral defense itself that is the that is the big problem here everybody is wored about the esculation meanwhile democrats the more radical democrats they of course are jumping in and saying it is iulegal we cannot we cannot have this we have let the hoothies do this thing rocona who again i know ro nice enoghgi but this is ridiculous he says the president neds to come to congress before launching a strike against the hoothies anyemman when involving us in another middile's conflict that is artical one of the constitution no it isnt no it is not in the president does have the power to respond in a tacsinareoes and in war time sinareoes and under the war power to act he then has to inform congress within sixty days of what he is doing and ten congress is the ability to stop what he is doing within sixty days that is the actual legal regime that applies here the president does have inherent power to take immediat military action without informing congress is is not a declaration of war on thehoothes fired a few mistiles at a few empty factories is what exactly happen representative valahoil of oregon treated the same thing quot these air strikes have not been authorized by congress the constitution is clear congress is the sole authority to authorize military involvement in oversees conflicts but no a again that is wrong the war powers act governes er the present has forty hours woen forom congress in congress has been duly informed meanwhile promiligiapalsas this is unacceptable violation of the constitution artical one requires military action be authorized by congress i love that all of the exact same members of congress who said that jobidon had the inherent authority to cancil a trillion dollars in student loned dat that jobidon have the inherent ability to mandate that eighty million americans take a vaccine that brackobama had the inherent power to simply pardon millions of illegal imigrants through proscutorial discretion under dacka these same people are if the presiden in fires a a missilen has a camel in the aske he better inform us its violationof artical one that is that at's the most important thing i asked the feeple abis is that is not what the constitution says thit is not i'msari it is not the president does have some inherent war making power the extent of that ware making power is to find by the war powerse act as the supreme court has already ruled multiple tons a now again much of this is not about even what is going on with ron there'is an acess that has formed it is wron and china and russia and north carea is sort of power of it but nobody cares by northcoria but that it that is the acis the aciss and runis to acts them men the actively work with one another a ron gets newclear tecnoligy from russia aron ships drones to russia china is getting oil from aron and russia and that that is the acs that has formed what is more important is tht again displays of weakness ten to lead to more aggression in global politics that is just the way this works right now there is an election going on in tiwan and one of the questions is gun to be just how appeasement oriented is the government the new government of tiwan going to be it is ti wons our shipping military tecto china china progao ka we ought we wanted we do notned to invade or anything isan entire article in political called if they really want to take ti won back what can we do ond the even elections ti on ese voters tic to choice between appeasement and resistant why exactly with tha peace china because their afraid the west is not kon an come to their defence is the real answer and honestly under jobidne why would they believe the west is going to come to their defense i know the jobiton has tried to restore some level of credibility completely lost oring af cannistan th united states made a twenty year commitments to tens of thousands of american allies in afganisan peopl actively worked with the american government made commitment to tens of millions of people that the taliban would not remain in control of the government and then they left all of those people to be ruled by the worst people on earth again the talaban the ho thes of a peace if this is not ther work thogether but they have the same general view of the world despite religious differences vit they tthe the bidminstration tried for restored deturrents by providing aid in ou crane and to certain extent they did the question is weather it was enough is that enough to stop china from doing what it must now again here is my out ofthe box prediction for how the rest of this year goes if jobidon continues to trail donal trump in the poles if we get to june july again tha zune trumpits de nominy if we get to june july and donald trump is up in the poles by four or five points nationally and leading in the swing states i think china will make a movement i want and the time on ese i think no this becas the time on ease are thinking to themselves o ka if the essisn goingto come to our defence in what exactly are we supposed to do congress recently rejected of coursethey bide administration proposal coing to politoco to send more than a hundred billion dollars in age to you crane israel and tiwan that legislasion failed a precedural vote according to angelo onga eight tiwones american clean energy advocate she used to say that if china stepped in and try to shut down the time on straite the united state would step in and she says that she is on sure now suse when a time when ese person comes to me an says you see what they did to u crante in curage them to stand up in fight russia and then when things doncle ol their abandon i find a very difficult have a god come back to that there is not really about you cranoedes about afganastan is about the uusis commitments in a rock it is about the fact that the united states population generally does not have the will for long occupations or wors which is fine but you cannot get involved in those things in the first place if your not coun aget involves in tose things you have to involve yourself in preventative measurers that you do not actually have to engage in the long standing sert of occupations and wars that th united states engaged in for the first twenty years of the new malonium and just one second we will get to more on form policy because again ou uss militaries in catostrophic shape under jobidon truly catostrophic shape first it is a signature razor from germy's razors lgnas it is right here behold a rasor the precision five get one handl pluss one blade carfridge git for only fourteen ninety nine as you can see it is magnificent it is crafted with luxurious tunks in handle five wilded steel blates a precision tremor for a close smooth shave round herolines and hardtoreach places remember the precision five is no ordinary razor it is a sword in the battle for beliefs to banners wave into a new economy a precision instrument to force well companies to earn backour dollar and stop denegrating your values it is also still arasor 'll give you great shave the precision five starts at fourteen ninety nine the price this lod is never been easier to stop giving your money to woll corporations who hate your gots troin over two hundred thousand cust mers who ditch their wolk razers and switched on over to jermys there is never bee a etter time an anover to jermy's razors i come to day meanwhile i the midst of all this cass the army's recruipments happerits continued to be complete disaster area according to bright bart di com the army's recruiting of white soldiers in twenty twenty three had drop by almost half in the last five years according to report that dramatic decline has coinsidet with a push by the ser is to incruats recruipment of more diverse population according to that report that decline of whit recruits as also coincided with the army missing its target of sixty five thousand recruits in twenty twenty three by ten thousand again the the kind of army' strategy which seems to be promotion of diversity above actual military capacity it is kind of am an amazing thing in the fact is that dis proportionately the military draws from conservative areas of the united states promoting the individual sectual exploration of your recruits is probably not the thing that is going to draw people to the american military meanwhile jobidn of course is taken a a rather weak position on form policy and its led to all of these conflicts when a comes to the economy by the way the economy continues not to be jobidon's friend according to the walster jornal in flation edged up in december a reminder of the pressure still facing consumers in flations cool down from the historic hies of last three years keeps the federal reserve on tract to holdrates steadylater this month but it is not clearly an an op cutting all of those interest rates an jobidon really needs the interest rates cut if you wants to see some sort of artificial economic boom before the election economic stagnation by the ways the recipe for the next few years in the united states the consumer price indecs increate three point four per cent from a year earlier in december that acceleration from novembers threue point one per cent edvans chosen flation is not fully beaten by the way when he say not fully be niner stand the wel got usedto crazy numbers nine per cent in flation yere inear and a large part of that was because a supply chenshocks i'm but normally the inflacierat is supposed to be two per cent they are missing that you per sent by a large margin when it is coming in hot at three point four per cent and when cor inflation is at three point nine per cent and by the way you noi's going to exascerbate all that supply chenshocks it is gon to exascerbate all of that meanwhile jobidn trying to happ y talk his way through the sereis jobidon's top economic adviser well braner since donwory jobiden is fighting for consumers which his where con consumers are just gettin shall act if you run down in fletiin fro thin crevitor biden cam into offis oerall thi ga fletini is u thevntin wor i rer cent tho du ta bu thirty porpers at ele crut titis a twenty then per cent what cure me ti tomerics or feeling tit every day wher the avin us yatho a the presenth method is very much hes a fighting por american can sumer hs fighting to lower cot om by spending more money by facilitating massive desruptions in the supply chon with apient meanwhile speaking of other massive desruptions the american way f life and one hic is promise for jobidon is that he c could have run as ha moderate and governed as ha moderate he cold have done those things he did not do those things he ran for the primaries as h moderate than he shifted to his left for the general figuring he beat donal trum and then he governed as somebody of the left wing of his party tand now he has held hostage by the left wing of his party is particular tron border policy again what is amazing right now is that jobidon could fix many probis with his administration if he would just acknowledge that the border needs to be closed remember there is a bill waiting to be passed then involves massive funding for you crane that would get you crane hor probably another year of fighting off russian gression there is a bill that provide fourteen billion dollars an aide to israel is r could finish the job with come oss and also push off his ballot in their north that same bill provides defence aid two tiwon to prevent the possibility and to turn the possibility of a chinese blockade or invasion of the island all jobidon has to do to get that it is to litify the boarder that is all he has to do and he is saying no he is saying no and all of those problems continue to matastisize all of them you crane come os hi won and the boarder all continue to metastacize why because jobid nection wants to stop the first or he knows that foreign caas is not good for his reelect efforts but he will mot give op on the open boarder it is an amazing and why because his own base it large sloton iown base have taken the ideological position that people have a right to come to the united states that is literally position that is being taken by many members of his own caugus sto represent of promilogiapo a wild left progressive crazy cooky person she says thet jobite has been too heavy handed on the southern border i mean i i do not know what to say to that i've been to the southern border that is just a wy he is been too heavy handed on the southern border men the board patrol has already been turned into bellmen for a legal emigrans that is exactly what is happen on the southern border we will have all sorts of contact homing out about this and in the near future all the filaman and what is going on s a deep dive into the boarder it is a disaster area down there but the only i guess promilgiapologist mad that the boardr patrol agents and bringing fizzy drinks for the illegal emigums that that is the only thing i can think of that she is talking about here there is much fer mon gring going on that it is difficult to know exactly where to start but let me say this first the bidman ministration is inforcing emigration laws in fact the administration has been heavy handed an recent months that i have serious concerns about how they are conducting gorder enforcement out of their mind out of their damned minds heavy handed by what metric by what metric we went through the stats a litte but earlier this week by the stats at least two point for million people v entered the country illegally at least across the southern border in the last year can that in fizcul your twenty twenty three that is insane kant but but tit is too heavy handt began if jobidon chooses to allow his campaign to be held hostage by these people he is going to losein you diserves to lose which is why republicans should probably get out of his way are do not first real poltics do not get in the way of your opponent when he is making a mistake it is why all the fights that are happening right now about budgeting and all vressus let us be real about this the serious trivers of federal debts are not all the discretionary programs that are currently being greenled in whatever budget deal myht johnson cuts with the democraps o of it i thnk to bad deal also you ave democratic senat and democratic president let us be real about this what re publican's need what the country neds more than anything else is jo bidon out of office and democrats not in control in the senate if you get in the way of that you are going tend up with more democratic governents in order to actually effectuate your agenda you have to whold power you cannot just told some of the power you have to hold enough power to be able to do what you want to do this is why now i have nothing but sympathy for people are very upset wit the deal that might johnson is about to cut with regard to the continuing funding of the government but this notion thayure ging to oused him becaue you are mad at him now you yes at mccarthick is you are mat him maybe the insensid structure is that he is don to have to cut that deal because what is the alternative going into permanent government shut down another's some people in the base who might want that when yous explain if that happens jobidon is the presedent or another for years meanwhile jobidon is to obviously ailing and this also has not impact and how form policy is con ducted it has a feeling it is it is a there is a pervasive feeling this ad ministration is not in control that is completely out of control now what was always funn about the trumpadministration is trump himself felt he was not in control but it felt theadministration was in control why because donal trum was the retorical face of his own administration but is rhetoric very often did not matchis policy it is why by the way you are seeing emergint caps inside the republican colition on wide variety of ideological ishes because trump talked in one way than his administration did something different a donal trump talk an isolationist but then his administration was pretty hawkish donald trump for example was big into the idea of say american subsidies in terriff but his ad ministration actually facilitated for the most part free trade deals and non subsidies i tos toll lot of what his administration did is not the stuff the donetrum talked about it is there is always a feeling with trump that elcave fine he is treating something now but at least i know at least i know that the economy is good and pieces breakin ot the idle east and we do not have an ongoing s supply chan crisis in te red see andwhere ot superworry about china invading ti wone and all lik that is howt feel with jobidon number one he cannot actualy speak any more every time he speaks as i' said before it took watching niquell and a cross volcano on a tirope yofrejust waiting for him to fall down that is the real reason you are watching is because you want to know where you were the moment that jobidon collapse ind mean it really is sad it is not good for the country's not good for jobidon it is reely sad and beyond that cannot speak and his administration is out of controls he is ot a secretary defensigles completely awall for week no problem hi's got a secretary of transportation whose who goes completely awall for two months no problem who that hells in control over there it' certainly is not jobidon how much is it not cobidon they are now trotting out jill to basically say you should have sympathy for my aged husband yesterday jobidon did the rounds talking bout how jobidon's age was an asset if his age were an asset do not you thin he would be jobidon in this interview and not doctor joe the greatest doctor of all who can heal your hart attack with an education paper here we go your husband is avy one at the end of the second term he beity six as his life partner forty six years is there a part of you that is worried about his age an helt can he do it he can do it and i see joe every day i see him out h travelling around this country i see his figer i see his energy i see his passion every single day to those who say i cannot bot for jobid is too old what is sa i say his age is an asset a is wise yes he is whishe as wisdomhe as experience he knows every leader on the world stage he is liped history he knows history he is tatful in his decisions he is the right man or the right person for the job at this moment in history i mean just as he lived through the pallponnetian wor does not mean that he is sent tiens any more he isnin t aches he knows every world leader he does not even know who is in the room he thinks dead people are alive in rooms that he goes in to he oesn't know the names of the members of his own cabinet he oesn't know where he is half the time which is wy again that vidio last week of jobidon giving what was essentially his kick off campaigns speech over a valley forge and jobidon charging up there a night nurse trying to drag him back to bed because she is wandering the halls and made p in a corner somewhere means an amazing midio she literally charges op man she is shes fast her that she you same bolt off that line he finishes that speechin she is up there ban a shot and she grabs him and she tries to trot him back but not before he whispers back to megrophon i know abou abouer and then she drags him off the stage shikg avaudeville act srer lie a big old canen jip just tat zips him off the tach and were sppose to believe that things are going well and then joe has to assure us that we do not knw how hard joe works e maybe we n't know hhardjo works because he calls a lid every afternoon at two p ms who can go down the local dennes for the earlybirdspecial and i think what people do not see is how hard jo works every single day that he gets up thinking what he can do for the american people oh is that is that what he gets up doing again i've said before an ins troe jobine must be the happiest person in the world becuse every morning he wakes up in somebody tells me's president it must be just incredible in any case all this means tht he is an an awful lot oftrouble by the way one the ways that he is an awful lot of trouble an astonishing column to day from bret stevens brettstevens is about as largely trom critic as is possible to be restevens is not as from fain i believe he voted against him in bout twhenty sixteen and twenty's twenty he is a conservative and from the forn policy been ontrums of social policy he writ a colum for the ne york times to day and here is wht it says quote the case for trump by some one who wants him to lose the entire colum is about od things were beter whon trump as president it is true it is a true thing is barring a political miracle or an act of god it is overwhelmingly likely the doal trumple again be the republican parties nominy for president lord help us what should those of us f of consistently opposed him du you cannot defeat an opponen if you re fuse to understana makes him formidable too many people as specially progressives faile to think deeply about the enduring sources of his appeal since illspen the coming your strenuously opposing his candidacy let me here make the best case for trump that i can he says begin with fundamentals trump got three big things right arguably the singamost important geo political fact of the century is the mas migration of people frum south to north an east to wess trausing tactonic demographic cultral economic and ultimately political shifts trump understood thes from the start of his presidential candidacy in twenty fifteen many of trumps opponents refused to see virtually unchecked migration as a problem for the west at all only now as the consequence of jobidon's lacka dasical approach to mass migration have become depressingly obvious on the side walkin and shelters and public schools of liberal cities new york and chicago are trumps oppon ts on this issue beginning to see the point the second big thing trump got right was about the broad direction of the country trump rode a wave of pessimism to the white house pessimism his detractors did not share because he was speaking about and two in america thay either did not see or understood only as caricature but just as with this year when liberally leads insist things are going well al overwhelming man joritys american said they are not trumps on flattering view captured the mood of the country finally there is the question of institutions that are supposed to represent im partial experatese from he lea universityies ind mediate to the centers for disease control and prevention in the ef bei trumps sto tractors including me often argued his demigogry and mandacity did a lots needlessly diminish trust in these vital institutions buth we should be more honest with ourselves in hid nit those institutions it did their own work an squandering through partison ship or n copitans the esteem in which they had once been widely held absolutely right and then he says another lot of readers and is the ner times corsang yes but what about january six would batelection denihalism and the threat to democracy but s important ut stretch one's mind a little says bret stevens and try to understand why many voters are unimpress about the end of democracy argument for one thing haven' they heard ap before and with the same apocoliptic intensity in twenty sixteen trump was frequently compared to benedo mousolian other dicators including by me says bret stevens the comparison might have been more persuasive if trumps presidencsy had been replete with jailed an a sascidated political opponents rigdr cancele delections a muzzled or captured press and trump stilding still holding office to day but none of that is true many rancan pile republicans regard the january six the sault on the capital as a disgrace and the lost point of froms presidency but they also believe it was not muchi an insurrection as was an ugly temperatan from by trump and is most rabid supporters which never hd a chance of succeeding an american version of laemerputent he simply is not as it is the twenty twenty four election will not hingce on questions of democracy but of delivery whit cansidate will do more for voters and hering you got a proble this vibret stevens he is right he is right this stomach probl with jobidons presidency is that he is a bad presidents he is bad at the presidenting and all these legal attacks on trump i do not think theye an i damage in they'e already baked into the cate every out sized idiotic statement by the left aboho donald trump is going to disappear of the gaze helps that when woill by golbric says this he ting is really hurts trump heres woill be golbric saying that when donal trump becomes fresent he is going to disappear of the gaze which you are you kitting me are'kittng me in twenty sixteen he held tha gave pride flag while is campagning donal trump as social con worry yeur fe o crat killing te getlik what in the word these people are out of the mind i wen a ma on ta wan i let ta man dictata who steteto tells you i twecho paple rom to tak all te joalist i tak al the ga folts i a wo we al round and ti superior tha tre wat you nol bolt for tanot or maybe the decision is between somebody who says wild an crazy things and i as greaw the lot of the thing but aturally did the presidentin kind o well and somebody who sucks at the presidenting maybe it is that can ii do not know that three four of that foury years out from january six twenty twenty one you can continue to run on thus i jus do not know i can i keem jeoffreys speaker of the house in waiting n the the minorityes minority leader i keem jeoffreys he says that tha house re puplicans are the party of insurrection and ipeachment are not people getting board with us is not is tired and old this week has once again revealed than extreme

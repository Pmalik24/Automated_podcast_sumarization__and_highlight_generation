in my body e on fol alarm jiang once told me that her mother lives for her but the reverse is also true jiing lives for her ma'm there each others only family but tmeans ging is a very active family member at her mon's facility the staff knows her they know how protective she is in early march when she heard about the virous spreading a nursing homes she called said hay i know its a trustful time

not actually hang up and she fad yoll e thoughter to call if ye think that we hafte weare love en nav a rout every paton in the hospital and er if i heard laughter all around and then really unfortunately a her her fay i felt to defay do not know w that fat member what but she that and there the one for trinete to be frank i would not offended i would not all mi got it e wa e i was worrad i was worried about having offended her i wous worried abou offending people whoar for line of defent she put her coat on over her predamas and ran over to the facility but when she got there there were security guards out front and big signs jaing was flustered she does not actually remember exactly what the sign said but the message was clear she was not getting in to see her ma'm how could she be sure her ma'm was oket she could not see her i be hen crave i was calling my back frn whoare tlling me that i would not bein a rational functional herthon i i hadn doam about moving my mother to a different planit i know tat out eir and i my consciens me if my unconscient fto i not holly responsible for it but i think some part of me new that there was no corner on earth at wit faith how would that even cot would that een work with a move she i on a feeding to she on a benca water she halked up un fo many different worring worling machine shin atac a time o move would be would require fix people om noincooding te can por talking to gioung i noticed she could not help herself going down these thought spirals fartich ways to save her ma'm all the things that could go mam and i think thats because she cannot do anything and she wants to badly but there is not a way out where could she possibly go no my apartment mi part my tiny omost few dou ti department woel not be to fit al the pumen that she ne and i would not be i would not be fick to care for her by myself om then what other fafility fath wit what other fafility in your fity faite what other fatility in america fate and seerbasecly out of plaint where you lay there i cannot there is nothing i can there is nothing i can do i fathly at the point where my unconscious is dreaming up plans that take my mother to mark my mind go the very flaing places where i think about being told that mi mother fentilator hofity you that my mother tentulator if better you be a vary if hard for med even come up the grammar fold if ith fel hard that my mother ventilator could better ser some one with younger and healthier this has not happened nobody u suggested her mam give up her benilator but she cannot stopp thinking of the possibility of it and then my mind gos down a rabit hole i thought looing up hirdres where i could give up half my long may be that ti healthy person can fell be fate beff i because if if about iabout long to selling wath fluits right and i think whi if i can say that other person that my mother get to keep peventilator an your mind jo then hours in tho rabit hold whach our comply completely youthus right because it is not mean to beek or not my decision what i'm progecting if probably totally in fain and find iffically medically impracticold dian did get a small bitter release she managed to get in for one last visit that was too week togo what did she goto say to each other becon i am her gauter ym her care give her i am her conduitto the world ive fa refonsibility to sud her panic not too jok it mi said things to her tha i think i would wanted some one else to fato me which is if i going to be on't cay we will get throg this i will see you again very soon i do not know when but it is going to be very soon and am and we will get you tis together but they warn't word i necessarily believe if i wold i totally onit she talked was seng hor hospital stes andit told her there is a significant chance that grown a virisl enter the facilitys that she should be mentally prepared for what that means ding thought about staying with her mam never leaving that visit becoming her mam's caretake her but her mother's long time ade convinced i and should be more help to her mamma outside and promised that she would stay with t outly as long as she could manage at the time they were hopeful of it only be a few weeks i mean i think out myself i do not know if i mad to ri decision i i think that if my mam is gon a if she is not in o surbi the illness then i should be to one in there and then i mean i din i my mind go to dourk places i think well who cares i do not pay to wrent who cares if if everything else tosin t absolute manit all i want to beou with my mam ye i mean what do you think your mam would want yued do in thi situation oit was it was wially hard to leave her if she began crying just hoterically crying because i think she knew that defit my assurancees than it would be a long time before i faw her again an and i think i think she would i think she would want me to say fate i think she would want me to find a way of coping through di

the street and i almost thelght normal it arrived during our heart week i as worried about my dad his hi res money my frien ns who work in hospitals my best friend was pose to have a kid any day now i'm constantly thinking about how uncertain each day feels and i'm craving normal my found her bac a canthor sented she lives in changhai and i alled her to hear more about this normal oh hey i ason a has ben nomhes in the e yo li yen te yen i yo yet rebecca is american but she is lived in china for seventeen years she is married to a chinese man her kits go to chinese schools he is carrying e hunk a frozen meat wa for what as he cooking i think he is hungry and ont to cut a piece off of it husband out of the way we talked china of course as had a much more or grass if responths the viros than anything that is happened in the states far they lock down wu han traced contacts i slid to people who were sick sometimes separating them from their families the government mandated quarentines the governor of new york has suggested and migh be for to nine months before stay at home orters are lefted but and wu han just two months in the city is set to open up again and in cities bacing and changhai the few new cases being reported are coming from travelers they been told to resume life is normal a you doin ho mi de a i do not kno a i think i've accepted that ats cone to be tough a but pard of you just once te no that it is gon o oke at the and of it even if it is going to be if it is gon o be difficult is that makes son youno we want a know whit is going to be ocanhe in i mean what was it what was it for you two months ago yet it is i mean it is i defily feels different now i theank two months ago it just felt yet just uncertain and things changing by the day am yes o the just every every week was different as this point it your maybe on the other side of thi possibly on the other side of this wha what does thot look welki yet things are feeling much better here i think heu just feels taking off a really hot jacket when when youar wearing a winter jacket and all the sudden the weather gets warmer ing you i do not need to be wearing this any more i'll take it off an you get short sleeves shure i short sleeves on and yojust feel yo just relaxed can you take the train now what is it whater the trains yes i just saw picture a from the tran to day and it would at the beginning the trains were the sobways were still running i think the wholeway through but back in the beginning there was one or two people percar and now all the seats at least th folto mi saw all the seats were being satin but i i have not taken the subway since january you havea is there he reason for that or is a just am i think i just told myself that that was something that i could control and i just tot no it i can get it there on my electric bye or my bicycl theni'll go to those places but if i i just i stoppe taking taxes and i stopp taking the sup wa even thoughthe're all running it is just cint of my personal think that i desided i was not going to do as i talk to rebecca and other friends in china i've notice this thing when they talk about things were turning to normal thi sat describing all tese things that are not normal every ones still wearing a mask here were told mot to wear mask in some cities in china basts or menditory bar i i saw the other day i saw some one taking a selfy and then half way through the selfy they were oh sho wearin my mask sayyou remember take it off and then take the selfy again what does tha mask does a sort i feel this re minder to you that is osis is not normal ya yas kind ofs me cause actually the government said you can take off your masks im they said they they had a press conference an and the government official took their mask off and it was you can take your masks off you only need them when you go into certain public areas but in reality most people are still wearing them then as not to that people are still wearing masks temperature taking is now everywhere when you goin to any publics face and also when you enter any housing compound an apartment complex a there is some one at the gat a with a little body censor thermometer and they put it up to your forehead or they put it on your rist and take your temperature the newest thing for rebecca to get used to has been this cuar cod sistem basely sorts people should you be quarentine or not it is a little an clear how people are being sorted into these categories but it involves people's locations being tracked through theirself on if you recently visited a hospital that are ones ind person bought a train or plain ticket it is being moniter the code is an admission tiket to do anything in the city i went to visit a friend a at their apartment complex and i had to firstal i to register my name fo number passport number and thet i also had to show them on my phone am a a cuar code a a little square code that am shows that i've been in shanghai for the past fourteen days i get a green code and the only way they can find that howit is they have my fon records and my a do yo ps cordinates ar whet e read or no how they find it but but that is not something that i do not know where is that possible yo as i do not i do not think i do not think now that offers that gives me that makes me feel i have a sense of security to be honest cause i look at it and i say oh will i've been here for the past fourteen days i i'm in the safe sone am but a n if you go ell elsewhere if you maybe go to another city or you travel abroad and you come back then you are in a yellow zone or a redzone to play a game a baskaball you need a cue our code an the when you get the park a volunteer picture temperature before letting you in am they do limit the numbers of people going into the ark across the street fror my house but a there is just it is it is always lots of people there now but i think they still i do not think they have let the ladies do thereon square dancing at night i think that is not back to norma the usually at night time around seven p m in all the parks youw'll hav bike a older women in older men doing dance routines line dancing routines and that has stopped and i do not think it is come back rebecca says they discourage it tecause a crowds would be too much i doubt that our future in the you ask looks anything what rebeccons describing but everything feels chaotic cure and the idea that eventually that feeling stops o get used to the new normal i can take comfort in that emmanial berry se st a a wsar stoli

well yesterday the supreme court disappointed every one on the far left by ruling nin nothing that actually states cant just random we take presidential candidates off the ballat and they did for a couple reasons as we discusse yesterday thiy they said that first of all states do not have the ability to remove a federal candidates because federal candidates our candidates for federal office and second they said that if you are going to defind insurrection under the fourteenth amendment that have to be done by congress not by some mirando at the state level regardless of the ration ow the nine o decision has made people very very very angry on the left they believe that they understood the law and by understood the waw they mean that they thought that they finally had trump every time they think they have trump is the ending of a schooby du cartun we unmasked him oh no we would gotten away with it but one for those darn kids and then sgerurder thay that that t legitimately every time they tried to get trump they and up being unmassed as fools and this means that they then have to expose what their actual agenta was in the first place which was of course not to bar in insurrectionist from higher office the purpose was to get rid of the republican likely nominy forguanominy that the person was crurrently leading jobiden bi in outside the range of irror amount in all the national poling yesteray the colerat of secretary of state the person who initiated this entire stupid process in the state of colorada pres numed genna griswell she said that well now that the supreme court has said tat we can'chd removed don al trump from the ballat democracy is at at threat mean democracy may in fact collapsed because people migt vote now know you are thinking yourself which is hold up people might votes o democracy is it risk that is legitimately what people on the left thank about donal trump donel trum might win therefore democracy is at risk we have to stop you from voting becausewe have to save democracy here is the colerat of secretary stat yesterday cristan tormons i i would sa its good bac e court issue i dadecision americans have been voting all across the nation and early oting or crindos supertune state states including here in colorado and coloradans and americans diser to know whe their trunp as a cuolified canidateunmy larger reaction ins disapquitment i do believe that states should be able under our constitution to bar oarth breaking insurrectionists and alternateletistisition be t open our leavs open a door for congress tact to pass authorizing legislation but we know that congress is at nearly nonfunctioning body alternately it will be outtu the american noters to save our democracy and o vanger oh no the american voters migh have to save our democracy you mean by voting wow i know what a concept now that the reality of the situations as a stupid legal fury in the first place whos put out there by some anti trump people on the right in a bunch man had trum people on the left as the walster journal points out that is qualification push against trumpets embraced by an idulo calmacs of legal scholars and tromp oponents therelight on section three of the fourteen the mendment which was ratified after the civil war and that it several of the unions objectons to the constitution among them it was buring disloyal office horts from returning to power but the entire purpose there was the tefederal government was going to stop the states from actually alowing on the ballad people who were insurrectionist were part of the confederacy main had tried to jump on the colar an a bandwagon illinoi had tried to jump on the coloranot banwagon and said the supreme court will nine nothing that this was a bunch of nonsense now when the supremecourt rules nin nothing on an issue there is a very very high chance that this is just balegal theory if this been a five for decision in a six three decision you could see people on the left sanguell it is a conservative supreme cort majority the problem for the left of course is that this was nine nothing yet people ake catangy brown jackson boding the same way as clarence thomas on this particular case and this is people my old friend david french to write a piece in the e york times lamenting the death of the constitution i mean when david is far to the left of catangi brown jackson on this issue that people's brains have been boiled by the trump of all of this as an entire piece in the yor times hettled the supreme court just torace part of the constitution know they absolutely did not it just requires in enabling act of congress in order to define insurrection but again the brain boiling was a cross the board here are just some of the members of the media who were a wash intiers yesterday we have learned that it was at nian to nofing decision ruly a da trolp canby out about the colorata at other states a not confident that that will produce a result that is good for american democracy this this actually what i had been concerned about i had been concerned that it should a go to the supreme court they would roll this way i bla if it wer sa o my next cat sas do trumpet still an oth friking an surrect othat stave confidence in the supreme court dazing this courtis partis te the court itself they have overstap the courtwen waurthan it needed to go our colligwalis olora has called this supreme court the yolow court the criticism of the court is that their play nan a fairans nonsense ulushe gor we seta court its had this linin occratinities to interfere in the election the other thang stepping back ai that this is another example along any thatter play out right out the supreme court playing a huge roll in a america elections now've just watched those clips you would assume this as a five four decision in favor of president trump it was nine nothing that is how far outside the legal mans streame these theories were and that is how far outside the norm the media are our legasy media for his part here here is donald from thanking the supreme court for the decission i wone start by thanking the supreme coret or gunanimous decision today was tegra wordnt decision were very well prented and i think it wer go long way toard ringing our country togeter with your country d and the were long wey work ard and rantry they were very quickly on something thet will he spoken about a hundred years from now n to hundred years from the extremely important il givenot to canm a normal statemen from president trum now as i say it was not is the legs he mediate going nuts members of left one totally in sand min i mean truly crazy yesterday he always have to count on the geniu cys over it the view to put in their two sense of stupidity it hers will be golberig yesterday very irritate about the surimcort of the united states because as graduat of harvard lowscuol as a long standing constitutional jurispredentialist wul be golberic has thought the thing that bothers me about this and i know it is probably the right deisen but i do not liht that we have nrmalized this man it is really iri tated the pom at o me that we have normalized him and his bad behavior i gan't thin the law sens lissan it would be really rough in his shun be the congress that makes thisdecitiens and yet that is not how we have been actic we tuick we keep sang stats laws we kee ie people e right tha make this chan us an then they make a chane on this that wel we do not want this that wes as lal now what is we senli this oga a no one knows what she is talking about everyone just has terrible images now in their mind because of wull be gulberic an she was not the only one to have bathrom thought about this particular decision he is olberman i know he is been out in the wilderness for while but it is worth while remembering thet keeth olberman was once a respective voice on masan b c he had a very highly rated show on masan b c actually if he go back about fifteen years and again it just demonstrates the revolving door between the asylum and emason b c wor jail and masanbsy or should be jail and masan b sa me ow sharpton has a show on amasi mes an anicate hes olberman who is just out of his mind at this point he treated out the supreme court has betriked democracy it is members d jucson pigen and tol ma goort a've prove themselfes in ut at reading comprehension and collectively the court as shown itself to be corrupt and illegitimate it must be disold i've been working on that olberman impression for years that is he used to be funny when he was on yes ban and don it is sa he says that the court has to be dissolved because of course they are not in ap te reading comprehension but he given his togree from the cornel school of the agriculture i'm not getting and hat his legal nowledge gain from years of shouting and fuago on sportsenter he has thoughts about the constitution its sa somebody treated back in him crimor ni nothing and then he' treated back something criptic and odd quot the sort ters fashust they are yurin i'm sure you enjoy being athe in it ts whot is what is you been going for there atn't even know y i'm confused the guy said to him cry moand then is he ping on his own face said those are not teers fashist their yurin in his own eyes it is unbelievable we are now just doing scenes from happy gilmore remember in shuderma gavan says to happy gilmor id pieces of bleap you for breakfast an then happy glmor says yof pieces of bleap for breakfast this that this is where we are now salid stuff there from keith old men he is peing in his own eyes to fight trumpets a strategy it is a strategy meanwhile the house democrats are threatening that they are now going to trie d passabill that would cotifid trum's behavior is insurrection under the constitution good luck with that represent him jimy raskan seit on tuesday on seanen at the supreme court unanimously overturning that collor a suprem corruling means that the congress has to take it up raskan said that he is going to actually now push with a number of my collegues including debby waserman shilton eric swallwell that he is one whois stupping a chinese spy trevive legislation that we had set up a process by which we culd determine that some one who committed insurrection is disqualified by section three of the fourteenth mendment the question is whether at my johnson would allow us to bring this to the floor of the house mean the answers no is not going to happen but all of this demonstrates there is a wide gap that has now emerged in life between the radical left and reality and when even the moderate left or people who have a job likesay the radicals on he sprimcort of the left who saw of a job which is to read taxe libe sona sotomir who is a far left person or cotongi broun chacton a very far left person or lanicagan who sort of on the moderate left those three people voted in favor of the nine nothing decision here and there isa complete distconnectiten those people and the radical bas and as we b been discussong because it is the single most important factor in the upcoming twenty twenty four election jobidon has found himself in thrall to the radicals at the expense of the moderates and that is why he is losing he is bleeding support from the middle he is mosing support among the base but the truth is that that support that he is losing among young people for example that is a marginal loss of support considering that a low propensity voting group in the first place the people who are very high propensity are independent college educated people who swing vote and and those people are not looking at jobidon and seeing somebody who is on the same page thet they are and the morgo bidon is in thrall to his radical left and the further left that radical left moves the worse it is for jobidon and the democratic party how far left has the radical left move they moved far left then now even alexandera o cozo cortaz is not far left enough for them in what had to be the most amusing piece of vidio of the year alexander ocoso cortes went to see dune too yesterday with her partner and hat shois then chased down the street by fellow left oing radicals who demanded that she say the word j nicide with regard to israel's behavior in the gosistrepwhich obviously is not a genicide and she got very mad she got very very angry did alexander o casio quartaz because the revolution always eats its owns shet a tear for the poor working class revolutionary who is now being beheaded by her own movement here as a lexandro cosecquort has being con fronted by people making good trouble against alexandero cozo cortez ua inin e t those cancing she is n walking down the ascolater and she being followed by activists she stopedto an f te aus tyou are not en te thinkin tther oe she startind loosertumber tere still following ar ound the sery whet then her husband turns round and te stop to ta wely ot a con i already at wa an yolin ave geen ap protan tat wethe ornor an you are not ayou are notyou are not ing you are not helping she is mad o man maybe shell break into a dance number now olexandero coso cortz you are genius leading light of the revolution inside t congressby the way we should recall there was ao c who back in twenty twenty twet the following quote the whole point of protesting is to make people un comfortable active is take that discomfort with the statis quoe an advocate for concre policy changes popular support often start small and gros to folks to complain protest demans make others uncomfortable that is the point woo woo she was such a spicy revolutionary until the point when she was confronted with her own revolutionary useful idiot cadrey gan that gap between normes and the far left is growing when ao s is now part of the intellectual dark web or something ao c has now been left bing she is in the moderate middle by the far left in yo bidnis still chasing those activeis down the sidewalk trying to panner them while they are busy misocing the prostates of the members of commass o good luck to all of you good luck ot youre you are lones who jumped in bed withthe revolutionaries and now you'e genovh to deal at that i again it is amazing how the democratic party has moved far the left michael more who used to be seen for what he is s a crazy left winger michael more youre recalling two thousand for hims a big controversy if you remember this far back i do because i covered politics then in two thousand for there is a huge controversy at the democratic national convention because michael moore who was a propagando stocumentarian was seated in a presidential box at the ganze with jimmy carter and ow's controversial because michae mor's a nutcase now michaelmore has become one of the voices of the democratic partyes that is how far left the democratic party has moved over ton again you want to know why people jo rogan and you on moskare now talking about voting republican it is because the democratic party is now enthrall to people michael more michael moore again jury was yesterday talking about israel and gaza and suggesting the jobidon has to abandon israel in order to win over his left flank again what is te real about this the broad spectrum of americans are much more support of israel tan the archonas but the democratic party is kind o split on the issue which is wild sance comosusa genecidal terror group that murders gay people seeks to kill every juinside hates women and all the rest here is michael moore suggesting falsely that jobidon is en thrall to the authoritarian beaby which again that is hilarious because beby is an elected official in a colition government with his political opposition who visited washington to see bengonsted literally yesterday but here is michael more dult youthing got oll tron a is ther threat that he is and jo bidon is gambling a by aliding himself closely with that ana who at the risk of american democres absolutely and and and gambling by alining himsel withan authoritarian can tello me somebody who is facing a number of colonious charges whos spos to stand trial this pass fall and that all got sho this side a is now thos of war and we camt put our priminister and trial the oben jo bin an agist i o i plead with him to na plen trom that in the wit hous you want you arnd ian not into be an the ab gng now shows on teby between on election to convince literally millions of young people they got of all begaus tronso ctrom of baga michael more by the way is such an idiot that he literally says in the same interview that israel should focus its ire not on ratical muslims who smurder twelve hundr of citizens instead they should focus on the evils of christians that is how to touch these morons are apoint the by nologof histry on on the enemies of his traiel wen in persecutin thes railies the the jewish people of this world of impersecuted for five thousand years o for the last two thousand years no o the persecution has come from wa european centric christians that is ben your enemy no celistinian help tof gildashwets no palistinian sood on the dox o ew up city wit bodo jeish rocregy retugies trying to escaped allacoss kan here to be protected by this country and were turned away the dosan or then send ented germany to do no pelistinian did that no pelistony rain the spanish inquisition your enemy your enemy is not the palistinin people idias why christian european ah people we been slaughtering jews for the last two thousand years i'll leme i let me take that just one moment there i have tor recover i'm no say this im in very considered fashion that is the stupidest fong thing i've ever heard in my entire life that is legitimately the stupidest thing i've ever ear in my entire life yes it turns out there is a lot of christian antisemitism over the course of last couple thousand years that is dos not forestall the fact that palistinians crossed a border a couple of months ago and murdered twelve hundred jews and still are holding a hundred and thirty four hostages including six americans that palestinians in westbanking gosestrip overwhelmingly support comoss that the greatest threat to jews on planed earth right now is palestinians and their supporters that is just a fact there is no other that is simply true it does not mean every single palestinian is a terrorist it doesnt mean that every single palesonian once to kill jews it does mean that a huge number of palistinians do want tho kill jews and a huge number of palestinians support terrorism that does not mean that civilians should not be treated as civilians but that it happens to be a reality by the way his history is just false also he is an idiot when he says whell you knows during ye i did not see any palistinians blocking imigrasion in new york know who was palisonians blocking imigrasion an britih manda palestine you dof whose palistinian arabs we are rioting against british rule in nineteen thirty seven after the peal commissian recommanded a partition plan that the arabs rejected and the jews accepted and then the arabs rioted much that the british manta barred all emigration into british manda palestine by jews leaving millions of jews stuck in europe thaty these peoples sdo not know any history but agan it is these radical more on torin charge of the democratic party it amadi that which hid also point out that is not just that radical idiots have taken control of one o the major parties in the united states were increasingly taken cantrol of that party it is also that who knows that these radical idiots are in control and is using these radical idiots the is lamists comases best friends our people iman ma yeldan on emisan b c or mady hason or michael more or aose people who do the propagand of work for them these are their favorites how do we know an here is an example yesterday the hoothy rebels and again the hoothy slogan just to remind everybody the hothy slogan is quote allah is the greatest death to america death to israel a curse upon the jews victory to is l ums o they are bunchonise people is a not probably just thered toor looking for decolonization thothies and ron back tera group well a senior hoothy leder acording to politico has now pitche that britton's newest member of parliament george galaway be an unlikely mediator in the currnt mat least conflict why should the new propalistonian and pee for rockdebia potential player in easing tention because he is a he is a in a pex useful idiot it is george galaway who once suggested that the state of israel be completely dismantled he was actually kicked out of laber in two thousand three and hu's kicked out of labor because he has called for the dismancelling what he called the zionist state he walked out of a debate in two thousand thirteen after discovering that his opponent was in his raily citizen es ta guat idont debate with his ralies the also mout with said i'm who san he also suggested twenty twelve by the way that having sect ofh an unconscious woman cquote would be bad sectual etiquett by not rape say solid gay and that is exactly hothe hothes want the also have their helpers do the radical is lamis in te media according to g b news the b b c has now been criticized after it failed in the most basic of journalistic practices beause he used in iar g c reporter as an eye witness source in reporting on gosi and again much of the reporting in the gozastrip is eye wintness sources who work with or for camas is just a fact if you kan't et just for the moment imagine that you had an area that is takn over by terrism tht ou literally cannot ship in food at ind get it to civilians because terrace ar high jacking the food ade now imagine they are geting information out from that temaria would you imagine tat information is going to be freely traffic or guthing the teris are going to be controlling the floofin frmation the answer is pretty obvious terris ham beng controlling the floof information in the gozastrip for legitimately decades at this point and the entire legac media just embibes from that well the b b c much that the corporation used vidio and eye witness accounts of a crowd rush incident in an aconvoy in gaza and the segment included o raport from one machmood awadaya describe is a journalist at the scene wholyd an said that his raily troups deliberately shot people attempting to approach trucks of flour in the convoy he said quhat is railies purposefully fired the men they are trying to get nearer the trucks that had the flower they are fired at directly in preventing people to com near those killed there is only one problem which is that dom iwadaya praised a terrorist attack in two thousand twenty three which killed seven is railies and also happens to have a slew of proterris messaging an associations with figures calial albatani a senior member of the paramilitary group palistonan islomic gehad the same legacymedia that will still print reports doubting whether there was mass rape at the noble music festival on october seventh the those sa media are the useful idiots of the radical islamas and they also happen t be the people who jobidon believes he is answerable to and that is whycho bidon is he is far off the track of what the american people want from him he is far off the track of what the american people want for hm n they want a moderation ind decency and instead they got this radical garbage with a bumbling old fool at the top of te pile that iswhat they got speaking of which being of radical garbage ith a bumbling old fool at the top according to the daily wire the bidadministration has now empowered a professional activis to travel the globe on the taxpar time to push trans genderism in generidiology from ostralia to prazi south africa to sweden justica stern travels a cross the world attending called pride evends as the state department special onvoy to advance the human rigts of lesbian gaye by sexual transgender queer and intersex persons stern who as bostishees the highest ranking lesbian woman in the abidan administration is paid an annual salary ofover one hundred eighty thousand dollars and task with promoting a far left vie on sex engender lobbying forn governments and assisting activis organizations she wias a point that bibidon in september twentyt twenty one her work as gone largely un notice by the media she bolsters the president's brouder efforts to leverige the might of the federal agencies and their buracracies and service of a far left to genda she travels a special envoy andthey have taken her to at least twenty two countries including argentne oustrog a brazil bot suana candida germany greee india lithuania malasia maricius mexico nepal the netherland's panamup perue the philipiane south afica sweden switzerland tiland and vianom by the way i'm just going to point out here how many of those country are of the countries that i just mentioned how many of them are radical muslem ruled i notice the wre zero in the iddle east i notice that she she is happy to preach el g b t politics pretty much everywhere except for where the muslems are malasiais the only country in this lest i believe thits muslem she said good forn policy is inclusive forn policy that means having senior eperts on el g b t cu i rights wise the bidadministration trotting around at tax payr expense this lady to various ga pride parades around the globe because the state departments sas quoted is committed to promoting an protecting the freedom dignity and a quolity of all persons including transgender non binary an gender non conforming persons around the world this is what american exceptionalism has come to me american exceptionalism is not things private property ownership it is not anything fre speech it is not limited government american exceptionalism apparently is el g b t ku i mine is dividea by sign politics that is the most important thing that the bide administration can be pushing at this point and again this coes to one of these central problems between left and wriht to day i think that it is fair to state that if you go back to say even the nineteen nineties there is large cross over between what the left in this country wanted in what the right in this country wanted during the clinton era that is why hoe could get things done sometimes because what people wanted generally speaking was a government that was limited in its intervention in dail y life people still wanted solid families there is some arguing around the edges with regard to say things benefits for same sex couples but there is no talk in the mid nineteen nineties in fact everybody was talking the opposite about gay merriage the idea was maybe civil unions and civil unions were religious about granting legal rights hospital visitation or rights in wills to gay couples but there is no edea of meriage as a substitution for gay couples for traditional merriage that was those off the table in the nineties even the left at that point with rear toabortion for example the qlinton line wis safe legal and rare there ise still cross over in which people recognized that abortion was a great evil and now thinks of completely broken apart they' completely broken apart and because there is no common vition in the united states any more of what even constitutes a good that means that you will have administrations promoting around the globe things that are not agreed to by the vast majorityof americans most americans are not interested in paying envoys to go promote trans genderism in malasia this is not something we think of is a quarps american value nor should we think of that as a qarps american value that is ow what except american exceptionalism is but for the left it is as they have ree to fined what it is to be a good american this is why you have seen much ire in the united states ngain we ou hve a set of common values unit they are broadly broadly rit even if there is a lot of plate in the joins be still have those common values he an have a country but when those follow way then what exactly do you have left the answer is not much mean that the again the fact is that this administration has decided that it is going to promote what it calls democracy but not really becaus the sort of depends on where you are in the world where they support thedemocracy or not right now the bon ndministration is promoting a tyrannical is lawmac government the palstonian authority in its aspirations above the interests of an ally of the united states that happens to be democratic israel when they talk about democracy it everyone knows they do not really mean it what exactly is the by administration pushing around not pushing property ownership naly pushing free markets jobin is looking for global base line taxes of fifteen per cent what exactly are those american exceptional values that gobin is pushing he cannot difind them he is let the left to find them for him a americans do not that leftist definition and just one second when gt the most shocking story of the day this with regard to dw path the will be passe the t e world professional association for trans gender health that organization has been used as the basis for pretty much all transpropaganda in the united states for the last ten fifteen years when we get to the corruption of that organization in just one moment first thursday night joing the daily wireback stage mtwelsh mchimell's andrewclave an germy boring and ie we all watch and react to the twenty twenty four state of the union live on

if this unfortsional is the reality of our medical establishment it is been amazing to s how every institution has discredited itself in this country over the course of the last fifteen to twenty years it is totally insane the one institution you thought would not discredit itself it science because after all science is held to the scientific method yof a hypothesis you test it if the test does not work then you go back to the drawing pourt but science has become in arbitrary tool of political professionals that is particularly true er the science is unclear it used to be that the first rule was doe no harm now the first rule is do as much harm as possible long as you can obviscate the results for long enough that is what w path promotes the litany of transition surgery scide effects

insane crap but again being pushed by the federal government rachl levine the assistan secretary of health who is of course a biological man is a path member and has lavishd praise on the organization tand quo it assesses the full scale of the science and provides at substance of rigorously anallyes purifu recommendations to the medical community on how best to care forpations o are transgendera or gender non binary it is free of any agenda other than to insure that medical decisions are informed by science that is a lie that is a lie but much of what we are seeing promoted by the federal government these days is just lies design to promote i ratical and insane a genda and meanwhile s being of a radical and insane a genda a federal appeals court has now correctly a lowed texas to put forward its own emigration loss is the federal govrnment will do it according sianen a federals appeal a federal peals cort granted a temporary stay of a lower courts decision to block the enforcemen

that texas should not be allowed to arrest people for illegal imigration betweens their actively intervening to even stop other authorities from fighting the problem of illegal imigration meanwhile the bine imistration continues to fib abaut all this john curby who the national security spoke person and really that a fact o competent pres secretary for the white houseince coreen jon periterberallator job he was on fox news yesterday suggesting that bidon has not disengage from the board patral despite the fact that the prior head of the bord patralcity literally never had

moderate and his governing is radical john feddrman was elected as heratical and his governing is moderate john fedderman comes into office and he immediately start's pushing for example things border control he' start suggesting that he is on isral side in its war against ae enicitleterras crup commoss and guss what he is approvalrating with democrats in pennsylvania is seventy six to seven in the latest quinnipeacpol he is not afraid of his own bas and that means that he is winning cas guss what jobidon does not need college students in michigan to vote for him he needs moderates in michigan to vote for him he is not doingiit here is john fetderman going off on the border itly ti is the demicre wou know an an willing and eager to go stronger than tha the border de a that that was here they might be actry appropriat givin tha the circumstansere a at the border john federman making the smart play moving toward the centre whae left is trying to proclaim that he is wildly un popular that is simply not true it is not true john fedderman is one of the more popular figures in pennsylvania politics at this point because he did not do the dum thing jobidon did the dum thing he decided to steer way out to his left he isgoin to pay the price for that electorally there is a reason he is trailing in all the swing states thers reason independents are turning toward on'll trump johnl trump has locked up ninety seven per cent of the people who voted for him in twenty twenty four jobidon has locked up eighty three per cents of the people who voted for him in twenty twenty those numbers not good enough for jobidon meanwhile speaking of radicals who cannot get their own city's under control new york has had increased crim ohy because they decided to release people without bale because that is the stupidest thing h you could possibly do with criminals it turns out fighting crimes actually super easy you take criminals and you put them in a place where the can harmony wels call it prison for example and then you just put them there and lieve them there that is what you do criminals and then they are not in public harming other people i know these it lhese lake incredibly difficult stuff that no one can figure aticcept for every civilization in the history of humanity but we cannot figured out it is a mystery rapet in enigma how do you solve crime probably should just take the criminals you'sh probably avn tic a trip quick trip down to the jail aflecada probly release them back ind probably they have learned a lesson and at all be grate according to the nerc post remember whan politicians were tauting the success of bale reform remember the meaningless and deceptive numbers they threw out ymourk city compatrol of bradland or claims in report only one per cent to people released on bale under bale reform are rearrested for violent felon while their cases pending and then state sentet majority leader andraa stuart cousince said the number was two per cent well a new study of bale reform outside in yor city in the suburbs an up state prepared by john ja college of crimnal justis data collaborative for justice shows sixty six per cent of people released under bale reform wh had a recent priorrest we are rearrested within two years of their release sixty seven per cent of defendens wo had a reaseent prior felony arrest in the pastier we are released we are also rearrested within two years of their raignment almost half of those where rearrested for felony wait you mean that criminals do crime that razy i wes stold the criminals are victims of the system and that after all they shoplif because they need bread in the words of that genius alexandera ocazo cartez by the way it is worth noting here that the center that wrote this study we are vocal supporters of the bale reform waws from the very beginning arrest outside new york city decreased from a hundred eighty four thousand in twenty nineteen to a hundred fifty four thousand in twenty twenty two even as crimes increase in fact there are seventeen thousand more crimes in twenty twenty to then twenty ninety but thirty fhousand fewer arrests well i mean there is a shock again amazing you mean when you release criminals on to the streets the dat makesm no no a california is doing the same thing according to the wall stree journal what would happen if lawmakers reinvented the criminal justice system to target's s stemic races hm instead of crime californias about to find out californa passtalaw and twenty twenty called the california racial justice act which means every fellon serving time in the state prison an jail can now retroactibly challenge his conviction and sentencing on the grounds of systemic bias s the prisoner does not need to show that the police officer prosecutor judge r jur was racist all they have to demonstrate is that in the past criminal suspects of his race were arrested prosecuted or sentence more often or more severely than members of other racial groups in other words if youare a black felin in prison you are going toeable to su to lower your sentence based ons istemic factors now every examination of sentencing is complicated by the realities which is that sentencing differs by not only the crime but the behaviour during the crime for each in every person who is engaged in a crime and simply takin a baseline of black people are sentence for the same crimes longer than white people does not take into a ccount any of the external factors other crimes that were pled down cri nal histories of the suspects behavior during the arrest in fact comparing these two things is sort of suggesting that women earn less than men on average and terms of salary ignoring things how many hours are worked or what jobs people are in as the walzter jornal points out cuart testimony now sounds a a critical race studies course when a fellon in san francisco contested his arrest and prosecution for having loaded hand gun in his car a race expert testified the arresting officers use of the phrase high crime area demonstrated bi us against people of color the appeals court allowed the fellon's claim to proceed the same expert who testified this by the way also testified that whites our psychopaths who ise behavior represents an underlying biologically transmitted proclivity this is going to heather macdonalds writing about all this s i cannot imagine why crime is can go up in the tate of california i can' imagine again pursues stupid policies receive stupid consequences ardyfolks coming up we will be

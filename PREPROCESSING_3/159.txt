a few months ago somebody said something to me that i found humiliating that i have never talked about it not anybody not even with the people i love the most is is way to embarrassing it makes me once even to think of it but itelling my love ones n my friens that is real life theres a people i have to live with you and me here right now on the radio we have a ifferent cond relationship frint i can tell you this thng happened well is still riding around the city on this ponsilofolding bike which looks ridiculous and there is no dignity to it but it is handy to have a bike that folds up if you wave in the city it was may be nine p m i was riding home from work and was wearing a suit cause it been to work and that morning it had been cold i work coat even the now at night it was warm enough said the coat was unnecessary but it was just easier to wear the coat than to be carrying it is also waring one of those you knowthis a reflective orange and yellow vests i was wearing cause i had three bike accidents thinks to the fact that the folding by loses as grip on the street in the rain extra precaution seem wortha i onnow i have gray hair at that point a neetly trimmed beard i was wearing helmet all in all i was a picture of fastidious care iwas going south and avenue be i was between third and second street i young women wass trapesing across the street not wearing a coat full of cheerful loose energy bright eyes she sees me on the bike i am this locked down button down helmeted overdressed gray haired man in a reflective best and is ha red paster f tho thing she sestome is do you fart out the front tht's all she sait do you fart out the front it was really kind of stunning as an insult its both incredibly efficient and deeply mysterious i doft even get what image she is trying to convey in a literal sense but i do think i get the feeling she is going for and it is not respect ful it is kind of you fussy fopish over careful old man i can i say that thought she had she coud a gept that to herself i think all kinds of things about people on the street all the time i keep the thoughts to myself i do not say those things tof people to their faces because they are strangers they are complete strangers they do not need to know but of course it is much easier to say what you really think with a complete stranger ith ar friends withoa loved ones it can be much more difficult to be honest sometimes right whn somebody you really now you have some tolf truth that you need to talk through with them the math of figuring out win to tell them and what to say and should you actually get into it and say anything at all itcan be complicated sometimes you tell them and the two of you talk through and work it out and it is relationship changing it is vital it is important and sometimes annoyingly if ficking blows up in your face to dant our programme we have stories of two friendships and it each o these friendships one of the frends has something to say to the other something big and afe to deside do i say to their face and each of thse stories it make a decision and then that is actually when it gets interestedfrom w easye chicago sice american life on ir a glass stay with us athat o what a friends for i harcely what is for star to they with somebody who had something in hy nee talk through with his friend and rather than have the tough conversation and get things off his chest and come to some new understanding he did not do that none enou instead he stewed about it for years and then he talked about it to every one every one but the one person that he really needed to talk to if be had a cornfail explains how thay worked out for him the thing gave malica accidentally got stuck thinking about was a friendship break ut and he gots stuck there for a long time eight years and then he took all those thoughts and did the thing that only informer theater kid would do he compiled them into a one man shew that is how i first heard about this story i went to se gave show one night becaus friendship is something i'm stuck thinking about too i recently went through a friend break up myself gaves the small time comedian lives in queens has a dayjob teaching kids how to rit essayis and he starts the show by saying he does not have any real friends what he has is a group of brows his word from high school and his relationship with them is very steryatypically bro it do lots of activities together much for its nd plavidio games but never gett into the knitty gritty of what is going on into one another's emotional lives for example in the show gave described spending the whole day with his closest friend of the brows neck and then afterwards going over to his parent's house in long island i walke thro the front door as soon as i do

money for this and i'm reading that text and realizing that that is not bhat i'm interested in hearing about i just i was not asking for legal advice i was asking i was in my own way trying to get somebody to be a man with that is cary or you are right i'm here for you yea ye am here for you howr you feelin you may be entitled to conga yes very sily no in fords and m i think i was upset that he

just gets it without have not to be explained have you ever had that ah i had a best friend named him and we ere very very close and he was inni my guy for couple years and it was really special when gabe talks about this in his shell this is where he pitits from here it turns him to this long o to the only friend gave had ever had who would have known what to say when his mam got sick this kin named him we would broken up with years ago but still has not gotten over because of the abrupt away it ended it taunted him for years this is the thing i'm goin to tell you about gaves one emotionally intimate friendship with another guy and the conversation they should have had thet culd have changed everything e in hgi gave that tim his sophomor year college at hamiltin poishry class gave noticed him right away bhcause he managed to analyzed poetry and away that some how did not feel pretentious he seems sort of casually brilliant wen dy after class gave strikes up a conversation with tim they walkd across campas talking tim tells him that he played varcity basseball on hight school which is very impressive to gate hbecause whill he would hoppily accepted his fate as a musical theater nerd he still had not quite kik that straightguy urge to begood at sports tim then asked gate but he did not high school and i'm amman i was as in musicals i was a little sheepish telling him i remember and he kinnily likes up when he hears musicals and he is dood i love musicals h's what aveyou been in and i shor telling him ittl shup of horrors in o kloma in oll testuff and i'm have youver been in a musical you t the stuff and he is well i was in one show of junior of high school i was not guisant alls and i'm all that is creezy i was in gosentelse who did you play and he sas a i platesky masterson am all i also platesky masterson ans we have this moment were conlike just looking at each other all that is we are junior of high school play this the same character from there gave an tim fell into that kind of all consuming friendship yeu fall into an year you and you have time for that kind of thing this new found verlationship felt different from gabe's high school friendships he an tim could talk about real staff that we talk family staff we tuk byut money staff we tack about the stacrifice sa parents for making for yuges go to college ye both us were on financialate both was cont a had this chip on our shoulder we did not necessarily belong there and s we canta hade this understanding we just got each other tim and gave uld regularly stay up till for i am smoking cloves cigaretts and debating the kind of staff you debated about in college e year asse this then timin vited gave to come work with him at the summer camp for kids with chronic illnesses gabe joined him and found he loved it in part because one night at camp tim introduce gave to another councillor kate gabe remembers thim telling him yeuregon love kate she is ark on a person tim was right gabe and kate talked for hours and at the end of the night they walked back to their bunks together and were doing this walk and it is very romantic and she connjust leans in and we kiss and some then con it goes off at lest in my brain words whatever i need tod do to hold on to this this is a real one the rest of the summer is dreamy but gave has to leave camp li couple weeks early to started teaching job in scotland he and kate staynd tats ther tuall in contact all the time textin mimalin sending poems back and forth but the more time passes the last into at kate seems to be eventually she calls gave and breaks things off gave was upset and wrote to tim to tell him the news tim responded saying he was sorry to hear about kate that he left him tim and gave and some of their camp frends had plend a new year's trip to reunite net and brath but when they arrive it is not fun at all at least not for gate all he wants to do as hang out with tim one on one and talk about kate but tim an are not really talking thet much why not i do not know yo a fell he was notreally interesting spending alontime with me finally days into the trip tim ask gabe to hang out just then gave is thriled i feels the trip he actually wanted to have is finally starting they go to a casi now they walk back to gave's department were gabe sarts making them the late night snack thk i frozen peats a bagles something and i prette the oven and tim is sitting an my kitchen counter and he says gabe life suck and then you die just out of the blue just at of the blue swere in a hat senir my counteries cinlix staring off his lifesucxon than yo die and an wi what is hat what do you think is going on i think it certain point is a part of you that kind in nows thinks that i can happen before they happen and you are please anything else likenanananana preparing for him pack yeah he spasely kate and i got together and we are not sorry wernackana apologise for this is coning what happened were together and you can t have to deal wit that that is what is gone on what do you say was mat i yelled is wht you mean one an explanation you not think you ma have your coming across kind of your dislike woat he talking about are there specific moments that you look back at differently i at him revealed to you the truth theit makes you revisit me yur yisit the summer ther staff party pictures of them hanginow and the night of the saffpart has not en wer ike could not sleep and you knose pictures of them together and remember coning lexuming in woreth her hands a thiyis is intimate a mara their hand her hand was kind of by his waist i s li you la too lo too lo they did talk to kate about all this she said she had gae but when she felt for tim it felt they were beginning the big relationship of their lives and nots what tim tried to emphasize to gave but even with that being the case 's pretty intents to say i'm not sorry ye he really said that am i recollection ye he was just orris i'm nockin us apologize a nockana ray ike li gan a met guilt yea yeit was dealing with a corporation that ceres your settlement but where no an admit any guilt an i con a keptlic waiting for him to be dof i feel awful wutd that if helpe i think yea i to think there is a way he could have done that thet did not and the friend shrip this is lhike gabe cannot wrap his head around why tim did it in this way he could deal with the break up with kate here is a scrip for that kind of heartake it was gabes break up with tim that really hurt because it was not supose to happen some part of the friendship contract it felt impossible to square the coldness of what tim had done but the guyd gabe believed his friend to be eight years have passed since then gabe keepes expecting him to reach out becaus and gabe's mind tims one who broke the relationship sit was on him to fix it but they selven talked about what happens he have toug tim and cabe broke up years ago they would been engaged befor that in gabe show he tells the whole story how he and tim met can'p scotland why they sap talking and what he wishes he could say ted tim now whatchim gabe on stade i was struck but not surprised by how much brains pace thi sallstill takes up for him i know fom my experience when an important relationship in plotes detonated by one spec tacularly out of character decision of course you try to make it make sense bhut it is exhausting to try and put a puzzle together when you only ap half the pieces eventually you have to stoplooking for those other pieces and make a new picture with the ones you do hou thot's what gabe's doing with his show an he told me for something more he wants tim to see the show tim can understand but all this was for gabe and apologise for the way he handled gabe's feelings and then maybe he could imagine having him back as a frien the only problem with gabe's plan he would never actually invited tim to the show how long have you been doing the show the first oin of the show was in these spring to those mineten s yhou've been doing the show for four years e and you have never invited him through that whole time no even though you made the show for him ye i know it is ons did you think that he knew about the show ye is presurely he knows about it why s moms on face book gabe's friends with tim's mam on face book tim must know about the show because mams gabe as soomd tim would show up at some point and handful of times gaxully thought he heard tim's laugh in the audience it seemed crazy to me to put much time and energy and money he did not have into making something for essentially one person and then stopping short of actualy inviting that person to see it i'll be honest if the thin gabe complains about most as how men do not talk to each other about their feelings i just wone to say du look in the mer since he was never going to take the final step just invite him him sow i asked if i could do it for him after briefly panicking he told me to make the call to my surprise n gabes anxious delight tim agree to come we were all set tim had his plain tic ket to new york gabe had grobbed a slaught at local feeder and started selling tickets for the show and then four days before the performance tim e mails me at midnight says he is changed his mind 's nockin to com he would realize what he signed up for find half way across the country to watch himself portrade as a villain in front of a live audience an thougt why subject myself to that i call and texed him but get no response and then tim finally calls me back the night before he suppost to get on the plan to tell me his mind was made out as it happens tim calls me as i'm on my way out i'm going to a birthday dinner werea'll see my ex friend for the first time since syou friend up meve a texe a year agow and then refused to discuss what happensc iwas nausiated at the thought of seeing er and yet i spend the better part of an hour pacing outside the restauram trying to convinced tim to see his ex friem nowing mind was just on the other side of the restaurant door i get why he saying no but i tell him most of us in this situation we just tryd to avoid our ax friend the best we can and occasionally suffer through awkward run ins until one of us moves away or dies but he and gabe have this rare kind of special chance to actually gets him understanding and i tell tim i hope he takes the opportunity tim sckeptical but the next day he tecks me a picture from the plan gabe heads to the theater early to get ready while i go collect him immediately i see ho i gave liked him much he is warm and chatty despite being visibly on edge tim and i walk to the show talking about nothing trying to pretend were not strolling into a very strange situation when we find our seats i tryed to talk to tim about how he is feeling but he is distracted looking around trying to se if he recognizes anyone ave filling happy to be here at o ir now a a happy hes thot i would use the work happy i would say this is its werto ser o tim spots gabes mom and then the show starts he gae begins the show breasily and right away there is some jokes that really hip for tim a ha ha ha a a i wonder if gabe can hear timslak on the stage gave tells lots of stories from their friendship painting them is his kind of budy comety doo if dead poets society were a buddy comedy the way i were takin engwish class why we just always praise whatever we are reading you do not put me the very unfortune position f gon it cn ass doing a professor another banger from mill youno a but tim ould walk in a potry class was opinions ye on't'd jist homes good disons bad es the best thing of iver the show is not naving in at take town mostly about how much gave admires tim and yet there are moments that are hard to watch while sitting next to tim when gabri counts the night net and brea an tim cim clean hes as well kat ni ar together in we are not sor i'd pinned a mike on tim and the absence of sound coming from him during this part of the show as conspicuous i'd spen hours talking to gave for thi story but sitting there in the dark of the theatre with tim no matter what had happened in the past n seem genuinely hard to be him in this moment i do not think i'd appreciated the bravery all this required on tim's part gave finishes the show tri umphin he later told me it is e best he would ever performed afterwards timneeds a minute to clear is head he slips out for a walk while i stand with gave in front of the theatere gabes in the middle of showing me the clobe cigarettes he does not smoke any more but bought for nostalja's sake to smoke with tim when tim as peeres arms open impoles gave into a hub he ma e h h we drive to the studio and get right in to it tim said it was strange to sent the audience hearing some one talk about him knowing he could not respond of course it did not stop him from wanting to respond ike get the moment when it is revealed that he and cake got other the crowd goes oh ha yim goa h ha ha h ha tat's why wive yor bulirg either no one bood to night sik te o caty i cant noaplays always different in this is thisis a ai agree there is a difference the two reminous for a bet and pretty quickly it is apparent that tim does not remember the rise or fal of their friendship and nearly as much details gave does there was one part thoug that tim remembered clearly tim had tried at one point in his own way to make amends a year after their break up he would invited gave to a concert with music by the composer edbard greeg which he chose specifically because there is this one song in that concert thet men a lot to both of them when they were friends called the lost spring gave frs introduce the song to him in college when he took tim to a green concert and then a few weeks later were up the three m plague that you games listening to classical music on the radia and the the song the last spring came on on the radio and i thiyou know we just contalic stop talking and turned up the music and sether and listene to i but an his is just very special moment as i remember it this was a context tim hat in his head when he reached out to gabe thinking that maybe they could be friends again as let us go to this concert together it is this piece of music that as is deep residence for both of us i and my feeling was this is a gesture of good will of extending in all branch in gave said now and at that point was a balas in his court gabe when you got that message from tim did you see it as the all of french that tim meant it to be i do not think i saw it as go this is tim putting it everything on the table my perspective was o tim does not one acknowledge the hurt he is cause he just once to be friends again without having to do anything si felt i think that perhaps my invitation to you to go that concert i think i was maybe overly relying onlike you should feel a sentimental about this piece of music as i do and connect it to our friendship as much as i do and withot me explaining it i remember feeling the meeting behind this should be self evident some think timan gabe seemed to havin commen is a kind of magical thinking tim ad hope that gave would understand everything he was trying to express complicated feelings love and remorse and a stalga with what was essentially a link to tickat master gave had expected him to rom comstyle ut peerr unannounced one night at his performance without ever actually inviting him to a show or even telling him it existed it is each one at all the benefit of being heard without the burdon of having to say anything at all the main thing gave one at out of all of this was an apology for how tim broke the news to him about kate all those years ago he thinks of tim ad handled it differently they could have stayed friends i know this is what he is waving for he is told me about but an hour of circling around the topic goes by before finally gave brings it up in a sideway sort of way i guess which refusei do you wish thit it happened dferently of course of course i wishuld at half it differently i iwoud tell you a thousan percent i felp bad about it i i tell you felt about about it but if im being totally honest i remember that conversation ifferently what i remember saing is less i'm not sorry and more im not asking your permission but i what i did not won was freeted be e a to ma please on to this yet i mean that that is it is illuminating there was always a part of me that wanted you beu tell me i think i'm in love with her i do not k want to do and i it least maybe would have given me the opportunity to be time i do not want to lose you was a friend you are coming to me and i want you to be happy and yit just what always was frustrating was it just you never it never felt i had the chance to be the bigger man that is fair a that is farnow ow ow no that is fair because you are right because because what i said and even what i remember saying you are right is it i si i n i gud to give you the chise yes to tell me now ye or ear to tell me you really do not want me to do this do you feel sorry about that tin yet wa sto what i do not but what i do not feel sorry for it is is the facts rigt the underlit ind but what i am learning for the first time tois that it is not it was not the facts no of course that was not that as ell and that is wait do you feel sorry but the way the facts came out well ye no knowing that that is the probab yoa why do you should tell gave that i just i did i think did not we you you dn't saiy a words i'm sorry no i think o but i thought i said that early earlier in the conversation but i am sorry for the way that i broth that nuse to you i really preciay saym that you tim is i've been waiting a long time to hear that i was surprised by how on emotional an aunti climactic the apology fell her tim was say ing all the words that gabe that wanted badly to hear and yet somehow i did not feel all that much and i think that is because of this other thing that kept surfacne throughout their conversation it is one of those awkward things and seems borderling cruel to bring attention to but i be remisse not to ask nervously i do they think that i cannot tell is whas your friendship as important to ue him as it was to gabe it was very important to me i i doftko had to answer that i think it was incredibly important to me i do not know that it was as importantbut i do not he was of of very very very portant friend to me do your friends now that occupied the space that gave previously occupied i do you did i do no we wrap up our conversation shortly after this but the question still nags at me i asked him about it again the next day when i was just the two of us talking it is a question very self conscious about it answering why because i i would not say he was a guy i knew let ges yet he was a very good friend of mine was your best friend any point it isn now oar getting insolict things about basked france and inlingly best riend can be a teer not a person thas runs a teer nt a person he was easy on that teer what i gave was on that ter i he ws certainly close to it i do not know of how drown alway it was dartling to see the truth of the matter laid bare tim just did not love gabe as much as gabe levet him and really and embalance in lave is not that ultimately the reason that all relationshipsend i ran this by game hat maybe there is a mismatch in their feelings for one another and how they understood their relationship he rejected that idea outright says he was there he remembers what it fell thi idea that we were not best friends consys heresy but it is just not true but it is not true in your story ye and i thyes it could be true in tins yem i just do not b and i think that is self prelivision i think a pard of me had been jealous that timan gave got the chance to come to some understanding i thing that my ax's friend made clear was not on the table for as but it had not occurred to me that sitting down together and rehashing things may not lead to some sort of new common ground that tin could just strike a match on gabe's memories and say no youre on it was not that i never felt that way about you e thats what happens when you try to talk itout ye nothinks i guess that the problem when you wrie to one man shel hoping it a promps one to tell you the thing you have always wanted to hear there is no guarantee that we will say the lines you have dsigned to them if your a confout is in produceyor at ashow give moca show solow a show about friendship te opens in october and runs in york elway boston and chicago digets ar iht gabe mala ca not calm coming up an words succeed where

hm is better friendship withere is something the two friends you not see id eye on and that is something is fundamental the talking about it seems just explosive and the friends have to decide do we discuss this at all we have arrived at act two of our programm at to pinky swear wat trang you thing about the friends in this next story is that they talk every day they are close best of besties and yet there is something of they ave never talked about that he is big and basic that one of the wonders are we really as close as i thought jesmac garst is one of the two friends she is been on our ship before jesming a hearing the united states in new york the gripam went a cyrus on the dayi left home i sat in my kitchen with my best friend gabby a taksy was waiting outside we were leaving

whispert something in my ear i turned to gave an told him i'm going to move back as soon as i can i promise e e that was more than twenty years ago gabby is still my best friend we talk all the time about everythig he knows when i'm going to go get my paps here i know when he is how a bad day just by the tone of his voice by now some of my facial expressions are actually his they just stuck to me wut the way i curl my lower lip when i find some one annoying but as close as we are we have never really talked about how i said i was going to move back and i have not followed through it became a sort of unspoken rule we cannot talk about this one small enormous thing until recently when all the words we would kept in over the years came spilling out ut happened by accid of course nothing truly happens by accident we reached the spoiling point by our own doing by assuming we knew one another well we could read each other's minds and to be fair we often could we have always understood one another instinctively from the moment we met we were fifteen back then i mostly spent my summer vacations at the neighbourhood park that is where i first saw him he was lying out in the grass next to another friend of mind a cigarette hung from his lip he held a keed mess beer in his hand i took one look at him and thought what a bad ass he took one look at me lanky pale blocking his son and curled his lower lip he was irritated i gat that mo lat me yet get tha people c te tining i col h muscular rul yet while you must fel lend that wat the o ho wel that look at this one she looked too white she must be unsufferel let te be e bae batgan and just too prove him wrong i took my first ever swig of beer it was piss warm but i chugged it down this earned me some respact we started joking we were very different i was a scared and secretly angry nurdy jewish girl he was a brown kid who was scared of being out at his gay but we quickly signalled to each other that we both came from homes where there was a lot of aurguing that easily boiled over into physical fights they dults in our lives they often behaved terrifying children y want badly to tell you that from that day on we became trouble makers bu gabby was not the bad boy i thought he was when we met we were not it the rodo te badrio rebellious teens the emwon e as yotat ol yo i mi but i ca cm all we were as he puts it nenio sinod children who behaved anties our big act of rebellion was secretly drinking all of my malm's tea we hung out in the park and just gossip smoking cheap national tobacco ripping the fillter off to feel tougher that yofll see yo see avwe cam up a that os mayou neticope you wil tin con bab ica wiin feta i cant ge a yet the park it was our island and on it we shared our fears our obsassions and

laughed as we stood under a ledge to avoid the downpour i do not want to go back home i never did back them and do not have to explain it to him which just knew each other profoundly from the start he smiled at me dranted his brown eyes filled with mischief and said get a cats our gount al omus want to stay here awhile longer i felt the rush of excitement of someone who has just been spoken to for the first time yeth i answered we stood under the ledge together watching the world around us come undone n gatan gars juverson if you gat befor a padcast the last cap that wat he ma copa wich i guess

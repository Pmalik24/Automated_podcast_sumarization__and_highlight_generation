welcome to the hubermanaone n as science science tae to welcome i'm and your hubermen and i'm a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medisine that is what i do for my day job but over the last few years i've become very active in teaching yourol science and neuro science related themes on social media and i've also been fortune enough to be hosted as a gest on various people's podcast to discuss nerof science and neur science related tools through those discussions and your feed back i've decided to launch of podcast where we dive really deep into scientific topics and the tools related to those topics now the formaded of this podcast is going to be a littlebate different than many podcast out there most pocast jump from topic to topic each episode or change guests each episode on the huberman labpodcast we are going to dive deep into individual topics for an entire month at a time for instance we might take an entire month and go really deep into the topic of motivation and focus and talk all about the science underlying motivation an focus what is known what is not known and then discuss the various tools as wel as some of the barriers to motivation and focus that exist out there as a way for you to really understand how these processes work within you and within the people that end some ways to possibly get better it things motivation an focus sometimes it is going to be just me talking to you other times it is going to be a gest here in the studio with me and still other times we might hold gests remotely and have discussions with them over zume or some other distance form at there is another thing that is unusual about this podcast which is that you if you choose can be a very active participant bi placing your suggestions about which topics to cover and which information you would to learn more about in the comment section we are going to pay careful attention to those comments and the number of likes that those comments receive the common section is a place for you to i give us constructive criticism give us praise if you but most importantly it is going to be a place for you to make suggestions about what you would to hear more about and we will respond to that if you have suggestions for topics now please put them in the comment section below if you are coming to this illitibate later please up vote or vote for the things that you want to hear more about and obviously do not vote for the ones that yowould to hear less about those are the main features of this podcast every month a different topic in depth as well as the tools that relate to that topic i just briefly want a touch on what i mean by tools toolse these days for enhancing ones nervous system or any aspect of their biology and psychology come in different forms some come in the form of behavioral tools things that you would want to dou to get a particular result of say focus or enhancing sleep or learning in lasticity other tools are about not doing certain things to get better sleep or focus or plasticity for instance still other tools relate to things nutrition or supplementation or prescription drugs or brain machine interface devices that you use to moniter your nervous system in biology or to change your nervous system in biology we are going to cover all of that as well as their various advantages and disadvantages again please use the comment section as a place to make suggestions and we will pay attention to those and you really have an opportunity to actively shape the direction of the podcast there is one other thing that is unusual about this podcast which is that i have a very large ninety pound bulldog mastiff named costello and he insists on snoring in the background while i'm reporting it seems to be his favorite thing from time to time you may hear his snoring or other grunts and various a bulldog things a he is an active participant in the huberman lab he is a a steady member of the podcast you can look forward to more costello appearances in the future very last but certainly not least i very much appreciate your interest in science an science related topics thanks much for your time and attention and i look forward to see you here again n

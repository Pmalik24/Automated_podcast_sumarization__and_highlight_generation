when he wants to explain to people what his life is these days ghen he sometimes tells this story on lection night and twenty sixteen he says he went to a bar got a seat near t t orderd a beer i started making small talk and i turn to the guid to my right and i said did you vote and from there he went into a long explanation about some shadow government ideas and and er voting makes a difference and a probably ten minutes into what he was talking about mas shootings and then ventually sandyhook sandyhook of course where gunman killed twenty children oon first crate as well a seven adults is tran om stranger than star telling wenny this particular story about sandyhook he thog the whole shooting was fake it had to be fake he said cause one of those first graters also shood up as a victim in a second mass shooting all the we ever in packastan in the corners of the inter net where people trade sandyhok conspiracy stories this is a key piece of evidence that sandyhook was not real curs a was rael nwhat happned a packastan was in reality about two years after sandyhook the taban gun down more than a hundred kids there and theres a public vigil and at the public vigil probably as a sign of solidarity with other kids who had died in school shootings morners had this photo of a boy from sandyhook smiling in way a spider man shirt under a cuorterya jacko fery cower sandyhoo deniers saw that in the coverage and they pounced did he die twice did he die at all to the guyde the bar with lenny is rattling throughout this packastanstaff and then as wenny explained one my co workers meeking meek the gi mentions the kid's name no a poster i an't really need to hear much more than that just needed to shut him down me sically to i took out my dravers licence i said look for your talking to show some respect the boy in the fhoto was lenne son no he was six when he died we he sure he condected it instantlya and an he just became more agitated very anger at one outside may he had a sigarett came back yeeld at me some more o my god how much do they pay you whow can you do this hehe ridit to his believe i was the villain he belave this man at the bar pretty much retefind everything about the way when he lives his life where he lives how he lives he rens in to these hoxers in person and pretty much every day on mine they think the government his paid him millions played the part of a greeving dad and never minds lenny is the sick one no is never even his kid in the person who has populized these theories more than anybody his alecxs jones he rens the whipsit info wars and who push these theories ihis radio show is you tu bedios oxjons made his name right after nine eleven fromending the idea that nine eleven was an attack orgustrated by our own government e sandyhook jone said many times that he did not believe the shooting was real shande hok e sha shan faic comcletely fak withactors in mi veu ma factor i couldn' believe it at first i do they had actors ther clearly but i thought they killed sreal kige an yo sho how bold they are thet they clearly us actors hes claimed that the government or some shadowy gobal forces othe ones who hired these actors he an the other hookers call them crisis actors as this whole alternate world that is his right next to the real one thet makes miserable frparents lenny but o most parents in that situation lenne desided to go all action hereou on the hoxer is in on alexjohns action hero i will do what needs to get done to defend my family damn the consequences lenny is resourceful heis dogged he does not give up in this world that we livin of hoaxers and trols he has marked out a path that i think few of us would every one antake but it is confamazing to hear what it entails tid anny show we have lenni stoy and then we have a story from riter john ronson were he also tries to entangle where this alternate hoxer world ands and the real one begans d beu beasy chicago is this american life o mir glass stay with us a guan down the rabbit hoe soa very bet the transformation of lenny passner was put together by meeky meek i say there is some curswoods into day's progrim that we have unbeeped for this podcas version of the show if you prefer a beepedversion it is at our wibside heresmiki the first time lennie became aware of any conspiracy thiries about sandyhuk was about a month after the shooting he bent on a media black out trying to get through noah's funeral and taking care of his two young girls they were also at the elementary school that morning and one of them was noa's twin sister she hid in a separte class room but one day lennie finally felt ready to go on line by the news guggleda son's name and fors wirst coming op ans herth result an the fans e and it is just completely discussing in just over thirty days this whole world had been invented and one of the sentral pieces of it involved lennie's wife in pawors vands were dissecting this one interview she did on sy anat it was with andersn cooper just days after noa's funeral would ye want people to kno boo he lavt running and playing with i siplings ing in the baple bats and fire flies and e loves eating inside of oio cokies and he played the vidio gangan sile adnasan ierstany use to tell his the siplings that he a that he managed to tacofactr yes that he was going to split his time as an a dult the twing manasin taco factory and be an astenat the comments on line were gross and flinsy why didnt she sound sater why would she put on lipstick if she was really grieving and was not she too old to be the mam of the six yerold kid they were convinced that something was up how ore you holding up o in am i most e time i'm i'm aa nom i think every by way out there he relates the fact of howlong it tiks we in a ban i thos a lans an yeu watch every oft o soun and eve hart be e an it tiks nine months to created human being and i takes sains for n a ar fifteen to take that away from the surface of the searth this reference to guns was another ahamoment for conspiracy terras some of them started digging into verynetsly looked up her maiden name and then said hay look at this there is as swiss tiplomat who has her exact same name in even fishier this diplomat once went to an arms control summit at the united netions maybe there the same person maybe she is one of those alegu globlis trying to make guns lik bad president ubama can repeal the second amendment suddenly every real sentiment veryneek shared about noa was getting reinterpreted as lines from a sinister scrit they were here an they matter they all had families an they matter and the kicker that senttip for these conspiracy therus anderson cooperer's nose there is this moment when the tip of his nos disappears because of a diginal gletch in the vidio what see an end says was normal interference that happens with a live sadlight feed its just a couple seconds but hoaers would not let it go they said tid it is creen sran or blue scran whatever that was a fak interview in vernic was a purchasepent of a fake stage to see in an interview that conspiracy fury was all over you too and it was all over you tho would knowis image i've talk to parents who lost hids and other masshootings and they have all been blind sided by online harassment from conspiracy theorists the crisis actor clain is common now he is a tacks usually star almost immediately after victims are i deed in the media and parents who go on tev and talk about gun control veryneat they get at the worse sandy hookis when this really took off tfanilyes get stocks fending off all this crazy hate by themselves there just arnt that many reshorces for thm he cause lown forcement still has not figured out how to deal with no siber hrassmet and the tat companies art much help son those families just try to ignore the conspiracy theoris and hope theyll eventually go away and that is what leny did for a while his life was a wrack tbut after about a year and a half they were still at it and he could not let it go any more i realize thit i the grieving requires a comness in a silence and all of this material was a distraction for me and it was noise and i needet to handle that noise that i could have the silence and com that i needed there is a potoi love of lenny with his arm wrapped around noah he is got a waler's moustache and he is kneeling on a tramplin with his soft smile it spring and noah has all this big brown hair fat cheeks hes snaggling his whole body into lenny's chass lenny's got tons of family photos these tost of them in and online memorial he made for noah right after he died the sandy hook denir is downloated them and re purpose them into cruel means wrote fake across noa's face te a picture of his headstone and photo shopped under his name is not buried here lotos of his taughters were circulating to he could not just leave them out throughoun the web with the trols lenny got consumed with manking about how to take control f the situation hadic strack noa ind his family from all this the narnet did not scare him it was actually his comfortsone he ran his own eyetee business hhe was not the kind of guy who satar out and complained about how something did not work he was a guy who fix staff you me to find lwhat te problemess and then find what your solution is and tins tar canning closure to that solution's tat bystup otherwise the problem is overwhelming and then you just want some one else to fix it for you omme hyou have the tract down where you can make a difference and get closer to thing less broken there was one other thing that made lenny especially qualifid to deal with the conspiracy theoris h use to enjoy those theories in self the classic fun once big fut lockness erry fifty one nass a faking the moonlanding wick what is the fun of it im it is spending your disbelief it is sitting down and watching sinsfection wll be and then looking at the wood if and it is i's just fun especially if there is no price to pay in your life in his now cost to that way of thinking that it is just a game sometimes he even listened to alec's jones in his car and in fact just a month after the shootings when lenny first saw those things on alecs jones's web sight he tried to reach out he fad a general infowarsy melldrass and shot him off this message alec a'md very disappointed to see how many people are directing more anger at families that lost their children in newtown accusing us of being actors have not we had our share of pain and suffering i used to enjoy thes seene to our shows now i feel that your type of show created these hateful people and they need to be realed in exclamation point about an hour later he heard back from jones's staff and they responded with we 've not supported the crisactor clam we onsisted it is a true vent inot this was not true jones did spread the crisis actor theory it was on his web side at the time and he started t lking about it a lot that seean at interview with veryneiqu he talked about it all the time fus we have got bity of ansion gouper we have clear bloow scring out there he ise not there in the tounsquare we have got people clearly coming utp and n an laughing in the doing the sat crying we have clearly got people where each actors playing different parts of different people ive let getted tan dowtinly there is a gover ot ther's actors ther manipulating they ben caught lying and the were plee planning before it an rolled out with it what leny wanted was a one on one conversation with jones but it did not happen therware few males after that aski meta prove that i'm really who i am and sor of leading on to it get me omsha lenny did not want that he is very private and very reserved a behind the scene's kind of guie he is careful when he talks things no combat that is off the raccard for do i have to talk about my personal life that came up all the time during our interview one of the groundrills he gave is that i had to run his coats past him and his lair tbecause he is worried about his own safety if his words were mis construwed also he is fiting some of the conspiracy therasin quire we agreed to his terms and in the end he did not ask me to add it any of his quots but he did request that we remove one personal detail and we did now a year and a half after he reached out talic jones he decided to try a new taptic he' go directly to cjones is followers and the other sandy hook conspiracy therris bi think he his approach was i'm going to make them see the light this is veryneiqu she an lenny reseparated when the shooting happens but were still a very much in each other's lives they decided to start releasing documents about noa report cards schoolphotos even disclose helis deaf certificate which was a difficult decision that we made but figured after a while af providing this this hard copy convincing evidence that reason would prevail and they would say o ka ye you have made your polite it o to come around lheny also decided he would answer any one's questions he wanted to join this notorious face book group called sandy hook hoaks it is sweare a lot of the deniers were congregating and sharing theories the cover voto on their page lookd it came straight out of a horrmovy a corps girl with a keep quiet finger in front of her mouth the administrator of the facebook group immediately let himen did you identify yourself is i am a father rd you s yetanh i was in stantlya to me it seems crazy to even go there this does not exactly sound a group of people who would want a listen to you people who are conspircy minded hat see these tragedyies unfold on the internette were on tolevasion they still feel separate from these events and i considered that a bridging that gap could be an important step at a human elment to this t thriht that is right and here i am i'm on the person and let let us see what happens the question started pouring an why were not these children rushed the hospital's wine was not anything done whyren't ye soing thean tase or whyn't hy doing this why was not a restu how coper colled from hertfrord and i started to recognize some of the patterns ther were there there are the people you would expect in a conspiracy group aunt i gun control people and i government people but also parents they were young parents with small children and they just could notwrap their minds around the reality that ou nothn't indulge can look and children in their eyes and bullet into their heat they just cannot deal with that tthe conversation on this facebook group quickly got ugly and abusive some of the members started using antisymitic firs lnny was trying everything to keep up a report with them heven told them i listen to alec jones in my car i usd to argue with people about nine eleven being an inside job i entertaing that we did not go to the moon but it did not work he started blocking people and fighting back this got him booted from the group whats remarkable is just how up for this whole fight he was when a bunch of people kept private messaging him lenniy thought what i'll to start my own faceboot group he called it conspiracy theira synonymous this name was men as a joke he has a dry sense of humor anyway he made some progress with people the people who were not full blown deniers who actually wanted help parcing out the truth of what really happenes bht they dropped away once they got answers and pretty soon the only one's laft were just dark sedistic trolls coming in to entertain themselves one of lenie's worst trolls was a guiname wulf gang calbig that is his real name by the way he is a retired schools security expert in forda whos probably the number one new town hoax are in the world this guy travels to newtown appered is an axper on alec jones 's show he is even called for newtown parents to exume the bodies of their children to prove that their dat hall teg ordered a background check on lenny then sendin out in nemol to lots of people it was almost a hundred pages the seeng everything from his social security number and fo number to almost every address he would never lived at with thodos names of his relatives were included to the online harassment had become intents that lenniy and very neek and their two girls went into hiding they wove been to separ ate high security gaited communities but lennie's address kept getting expose and hoaker started posting vidios of where he lived one apartment that i had move them to i'd only live there i think for a month and i got a call from a particular hoaxire who happens to be and prison now for i hap a murder and down he called me oup any was acting a smarass an then red me my selecurity number and then red me my address where i just move then to and i sad o and wa in to department that much anyway and an i move shorly after thact to try andthrow the hoaers off lennye started putting neutility bills in different names and got multiple peo boxes all over the place all this forse lnny into a new battle strategy if they were goodn exposed him he did the same to them he wrote newspaper all bads cling out halbig and the others by name and when these hoaxers posted his new address as on line he did the same to them he also made it to that if you googled their names the first thing any one would see was all the sandyhood garbage they would created and lenny being lenny decided to write a biography about wulf gang halbig's life called the hoaks of a lifetime he really sias an ew book lenniy became the one who knocks he calls us troll rustling it is trolling the trolls he gets both energized and sheepish when talking about it e insists sometimes the only way to fight hard cor hoaxers is a turn the tables on them and it worked on some of them frenk them out still lenne was just one guye and every day new mountains of contents about now over showing up on line his cursaded was a lonely one the hoaxer seemed dangerous those o the other newtown parents wanted to stay as far away as possible from them and i darker moments the conspiracy part of me would return and ask myself an i the only one that lost o child why am i the only one fighting thack thow is o and people were trampling all over other peoples children's memories and the childr n no longer had of voish to defend themself and people were just silent about it but while lenny was escolating his tactics was the other side around the second anniversary of sandy hook a small group of conspiracy theorists made an almost three hour movy on you tobe questioning the shooting the described themselves as independent journalists and researchers but their backgrounds were totally randam they included a magician the owner of ae moving company a guyd who been arusted for stabbing some one five times and a stay at home dad i dust hav an idea that i wanted to be an underground sill maker myself this is dug mcguire he says he ment this group on line on you tobe and got brought in at the end to help polish the movy it felt exciting at the time dug was a struggling fill maker and loss andelis occasionally did some stump work he got i to conspiracy theories the way lots of people do watching them on you to leniy he loved the ones about big foot neu afoes but then he went to look up news about sandy hook and you toobes recommendation system started suggesting hoax fidios he did not believe the theory that the kids were actors he thought children died but he felt pretty sure there was some other kind of cover up going on maybe one with the maffia and where did you get that information where did you come up with this idea of a mob had you rud this somewhere a no wheres cause i make movy i think i have an actof imagination wel let am confuse the what was ure thinking a a family head done some one wrong ly le say the movy good fellows o ca i henry hill is is hiding out in a little village is h theelso mention kinnervurton cop but when they relys their film they uploated it to a bunch of different accounts on places you tobe vimio daily motion pretty soon it was showing up everywhere to combat this lhen he had a changed tactics one final time no more talking to hoaxers one on on now the thing he would focus on was content removal scrubbing their stuff off the inner ndat he decided he was going to get every single copy of the moy taken down which was not going to be easy he could not just right into ou tobe and say hey the pidio was full of lives that was not gong to be enough the innernet is full of live he needed something else and he realized he had at these conspiracty therus had use potos and vidios of him and noa and vareneet those were his property thaking this movy a copy right violation the stolen images were now a useful weapon lhen he tracked down every place where this pidio was posted and he probably seen thus there is little button you can click on to report stuff that is what he did for hours every day and succass sort uff the hoaxers kept reposting and moving the vidio on t other sides the crazyes and o running the siln it is it is the plat forms who ere allowing this to go on that sedifies it for me that we have to just remove all of this carvage and that is all we need to do but this of course pestoff a lot of hoaxers we don' know what is goon on we just toli dan look right alic stones he was stumped lenny had successfully forced the imfulwar sight to remove pictures of noa using copy right show fros tray this is

sadlite shots from gugorth lennyn ot this vidio taken down too flagging it for privacy by lations but it did not matter the hoaers had taken on a mob o mentality pursuing an harassing money this is an infiwarst man named lucy richards who left multible dath threats on monny sphone ha yor a a a a o he a an a ra ha a an ywe an a nan r varit a ar eha hakit a y a e lut e had eae o she said look behind you death is coming to you real soon lenny was already living in hiding he would move multiple times by then becaus hoaxers kept tracking down his address but now the chances that a hoaxer might show up at his door and kill him suddenly felt much hire his kids were living with hin half the week and he worried about them at the same time he did not consider stopping he did not think it would make them safer that is one of the misconsceptions that exist that people think that iam only targeted because of challenging the content and that is not the case i took the action because i was being targeted sos my address is published all over the internate my fodo is published all over the internate and my living children's fodos are published on line that is existed before i did anything i dare not cause the targeting it was already there i has menamizing the targeting he poaxtad receives for firearms i'd asked if he actually bought them and he would not give me an answer amidst all this lenny kept up his daily ritual he would wake up make cofy and then sit in front of his computer for hours flagging content trying to systematically arace noa from the sandy hook hoak story there was a lot of stuff he could not invoke copy right law for the dath threats in harassment that was much harder to get taken down the tat companies were weary of becoming arbiters of truth making decisions about what its users could and could not say but lenny in his usual methodical fashion kept chipping away on you toob he kept a score card once he knailed some one woilh three copy right strikes you two would remove their accounts he killed thousands of vidios this way the hoaxers called this getting posnerd he become a hash tag then he and verineek help get a professor in florida named james tracy fired the sky at harass then for years an kapt ushe know his image to promote his conspiracy theories he is also the one who held popular eyes the conspiracy term crisis actor on his blog right after the shooting and that woman who was leaving dath threats lucy richards lenny reported her to the police and they arrasted her she was sentence to five months in jail the judge rebuked her for going after lenny saying quote this is a reality and there is no fiction there are no alternative facts he barred her from infowars and thother conspiracy web sits is one of the conditions of her parel won surprising thing that happened over the ears is that some of the hoaxers who used to harass lenny flup to his side there were dozens of them lenny says these were people who came to him only after they changed their own minds not people he tried to converg he says that never works it is a waste of time some of them became disenchanted when they saw sandy hook hoaxers who were more intrusted and photo shopping evidence and getting on line followers than tracking down the truth one of them was dug who worked on that hoax removig about sandyhook and twenny sixteen he found a fonumber for lnny and left a voice meu ey lany parsoner this is decad dug mc guire if you ever need me if you ever want to get hold of me and and learn about what all these people are up too ah here

person he could think of who knew how to fight back he wanted advice he tried him again and got through he told lennie that it felt heethen sort of brainwash that he been on a rullercoastor ride that he wanted to switch sides thenniy had started a non profit called the honor net work were volunteers help families from mash tragedies fight digntal harassment dug began helping him scrub content when you were doing it did you for he were doing penence yeh yeh and my heart is very heavy for this were you surprised at how quickly lenny let you in am yeh and i still im ah the fact that he even i's giving me a chance ah i'm very humbled i tell him my lov em ah i tell him that he is my mentor ah sometimes i call him boss and he says do not call me boss ah a you apologized to other families at

began texting me he wanted to mak commends he said he knew he should quik working for alex but it was hard ale paid him well and although he had seen alec scream at people in the office and punch cabinets and ripp down blinds he would only ever bee nice to jush as we continued to talk i realized that josh had not come to tell me any specific secret about alex he just once to venc's frustrations to somebody else who had known him a longa time but then he said oh here is a story the thing josh told me then would if true totly rerike the story of hw alec jones became ales jones first he sho know the alex's account of origin story but what got him obsessed with rooting out conspiracies he tolded a few times to the rolling stone jornalist alexander's ichick and drowing monologues on his show n i was shikin ers ald and i be had poege in would come i a shere of to pot the corri ed comi et shell bags of drugs people this took place in the dales suburb of rockwool where alex grew up and i woult ta stool they weld hv that or toa meeding about drug justyis of the hed they had carps up there that at you would drug your jus jupusad i was o polpory he was shoin coca extosy ast we they took me an laufas where i heain the wall told me wogall i cule you if you do not sholl up they sar you rom about the je it know for he moved out or arte because of a pleace corruption in rockwool had opened alex's eyes to the existence of powerful ucabals aan exposing them it would become his calling and at all began at that school assembly that is alex's origin story but according to josh it was not true the true story he said was much more revealing an it was also a big secret josh said booka i've heard the story a couple of times from chouted friends and family members very few people in the office no it but when jones was a tea nager he was a bully no one liked him bbecause he was a bully there was a group of kids hat felt unsafe around him andti there came up with a plan to crick him the invited him out to a party in a barn it was a trap josh said they beat him within an inch of his life that is why his family moved to ast im his whole family up rooted him and moved into a completely different city because of this crazy thing that happened to him josh said having as guies conspire against ale by luring him to that party was the real reason he got obsessed with conspiracies he had been the victim of one joshan i parted soon after that i walked around feplaying our conversation and wandering fashon look into it further there were now two ale jone's origin stories and alex's version whe was a brave figure forced out of town for standing up to corrupt authority but injoshes he was an outcaset runnaxol town by fellow high schoor kits at alex still been the fringy alex of the nineties i would have left his childhood alone but he had become an influential figure spreading chaos and according to josh being ambushed at that party was the moment that shaked him at made him who he was waso i dugk around some more et became really clear really quickly that alex's school assembly story did not stand up to scrutiny i bojucolena mesitsies reached ten people who were at the school at the time and while it is t rue that the local sheriff had been convicted of stealing maruana from the police evidence room with the plan to selec no one remembered anything that assembly happening not the students no the prince suppoll or the teachers tat one of alec's old footbool coaches randal taly who preferred to go by coach rande do you remember an assembly where alex called out the carps in the assembly for being drug trafficers well i did no that there is that your first im hearing about it yer his aformer class mate ryan tippton yet nat it all tha was probably ere ter program an i dd nat rema re that at all his an old school friend jacob alson hhhhe o that noll no and lena found the police officer who actually worked in the shool when alex was there who presumably would have been one of the drug dealing cops who beater palec his name his terry galet can that av ik an me prober wuld day o think anything that ever happen amy oi would be one that otiin i that never happen i mean o thin e w can brakly we were evor wain it init than inta yu wasin in room what every one does remember about alex is well how memorably was we hemout the same stories over and over from former classmakes quot he used to run through the halls saying he was the devil this is no joke and he spoke a loss about being satan or the anti christ and he would walk the halls with his arms flared out with this intents wide eyed evil look in his eyes and he proclaimed to been the antichrit his coach randy a egea he had in gether bow you bak he o away heople he with e tere ave you heard ther i've heard thas from many students but this is the first time i fredit from in at all well he could mak i an cun black er he would roi that bak in her e wul you yory

shetaxted i am not afraid of ale directly but i am very concerned about rhetaliation from his followers elen went to middleschool in high school with alec she did not remember any party in a barn where alex got revenge attact but she did have loks of other memories of him these sitting in art clasp at him across the table and he is over there ringing his hands describing to me in great detail how he is going to rape me been i never thought he would actually do that just shock fatter if alex have not become famous would you still have li remembered alec oh yes definitely you do not forget

couple of things hit was not abarn it was a house but more importantly the way josh told it the fight was the thing that made alex a conspiracy farest but jad said no that is not true hes said alex

alex as talking to me from this studio in osten i'm at home in new york i think the crazy staff ale is referrin to by the way is that a judge as just ordered him to give a sworn deposition in the courtcase bought against him by some santy hook parents ilexcept one condition for doing this interview he wanted to make a brief statement though my story is not about santy hook this is what he wants to say sho ho my shany of statement looking back before i was ever shoud yeus ago i review the information and i do believe the harof shany hook apn by the way that is only sort of true even ofter alex first admitted that children died at sandy hookhe hedged saying they probably died and i ten to believe they died i've apologise the famlys many tige in why few years ho my reporting has cause thim any pan hes apologies ar contentious because he is apologized but then continued to cast dous on the shootings i never shared did any wone should rase the victims famge and i ask the mediat o police stap shaing that i have shed that as best as we can tell alex never directly instructed his fands to harass the families but on his broadcasts he repeatedly talked about leny posners exs wife andson and he gave posners mailing address and showd gugalearth shots of the buildin and said he would probably have to go there himself is any one else ho lis going arase th famlis to stap whatever shany hook an soml eventis tragedy the need to be recognige its time for us to come together as americans ans humant and the fin the wive of shildren and other efential o diventual's period alex

josh had told me in the hotel loby i jarrod told me i's the story alex sweares is untrue alec's family would not talk to us i cannot say exactly why they finally moved out of rockwal in our interview alex retold the story of the school assembly fut he also named other reasons for their move ike hiw was ostin born mother was homesick and fed up with all the fightingin the end what seems clear is that this fight happens and the assembly where ale outed the drugdealing cops probably never did if i had to guess i would saiy that ale is replaced o true stories wher he is humiliated at a party wit a different story for he is a hero standing up to corrup cops and getting beaten up for his bravery in a way at' the same story as o one wit the whole footbortiand came at him in a balax 's the character he plays on infla was the beleagued hero attacked from all sides bloodeat but undaunted and emerging the victor s stories little kids tell about themselves alexs disputes most of the other things of people told me about him he says he did not pretend to be the anticrist in high school says he did not roll his eyes back in his head or dye his tongue black he says he never told a classmake how he would to raper he calls all of that in same garbage he says he does not punch cabinets or rit down blinds in the office during our reportings something very strange kept happening at happened doing lenas call wath mark the trac to man mark's taughter shelsy was listening on mute as he was telling lena how he knew for sertain that the police assembly story was a lie just then shall see unmeeted herself and said to her father o ao o a a e o e e i a a a a a a a o i a et kept happening all these people who knew for sure that alex had been a liar back in rockwal a loe of them

goldstin story of how he took a tell marketing job just to tie things over for a while then kept thet for ten years vining to is disappointment that he was better tell marketane that id anything else in his life stay with us a wan it is another to keel a sunrise john hogman tells this fable of giving up one dream for another much more ridiculous dream a few years ago the company that owns hosa quervo to keila purchased marinea ke the small aight acres speck of an island in the coribian and they renamed it quervonation they applied to the u en for independent statehood they encouraged you has citizens to defect vy a simple ritual of drinking a shot they even tried to feeld an olympic volleiball team the whole thing was a bold experiment and advertising vionation building but since those heavy early days of independence the nations patriotic ferver is calm to somewhat thits now used as a place to send contest winners and a promotional lure for members of the world press which is how i found myself had a dequervonation last june for a series of very educational to eel a tastings and how i met the nations most prominent citizen and ambassador to the world he stood at the doct waiting for us as our fery chugged over from tortola shaven haded o t a sort of look anton levat were it not for the speed os mere shades and read superor ocase the satenus to spring gray through a megaphone he alearted us that we were now and tering a partys own as we disembarked he began schooting monically around us with a to keel a shot balanced on his balld head daring us to suckad down without using our hands this was querva man the other querva representatives were there to teach us about to keila querva man i was told was there to party with us his job was to party and just as i began to grasp the fhrightening yet thrilling ramifications of this fact querva man spotted me he pointed to his shock round head bopened his arms wide and chased me down the dock querval man's real name is ryne mc done a i learnd this from the querva reps who i think we are a little annoyed that i was asking few questions about there to keila and many questions about the man who seemed to be there trained to keel a monkey actually i was told whe term his party cattalist and when he was not on the island ryan was going from bar to bar all over the north east in odying the untamed spirit of hosa quarvo meaning what i asked them meaning he does interractive promotions designed to introduce consumers to the responsible enjoyment of the various brands of hosa quervo tokila meaning what i asked them and that is when ryon ran up to the table with a toilet seet around his neck and a plungers stuck to the top of his head dued he said check it out plunger on my head and then he ran down to the beach and shuv sand down his pans and then he sang a dirty song and made us two shots and teanan and then he collapsd in the sir and barkd the seal it is sort of hard to ex plain what he does they told me and that is exactly what he fascinated me i mea consider the plunger were it ma i might have come up with putting a toilet seat around my neck sur that is a natural but then to extend the medical to take the imaginative leap to the plunger on the head well that is genius py the last night i was there querva reps realized i was lost calls they left me with a bottle of quervot specialan went to bed and rhyan and i got to talk it turned out quervl man and i have a lot o come we both live in new york ma rhyane is thirty years old originally from the boston area me he went to an ivyleak school and spent most of his time there drinking and feeling out of place yes the man barking a seal thats a princeton man nd that is when i realized that a part from some small matters of fate and several thousand sit ups on rhyan's part we were the same we both came out of college with an english degree the thirst for boos nd the ab surd fate that some one would pay us simply for being drunkan charming and in a strange but undeniable way for rhon that turned out to be true and that is when i realized i was jealous of him how does one get to be a party catalist i asked dued he said that is what everyone want to know that is my bag o stuff i beg a tricks what can it props guy an my field needs got my helmet stuffs monkeys i got lhe goider port i've got e three of them it is six months later and i'm in rhyan's apartment in brooklan he is agreed to take me with him to a couple of bars out along island where he is doing whatever it is he does and he is showing me a few of the things he will bring with him the speed o i have i threw tit on because it is just shocking ats shock value reber chicken plunger ran on te ball ther iis it was never rhyan's dream to have a job wearing a plunger he wanted to act it is a cly sha i know and did rhyan but he had done some singing and musical theatr in college and this was his dream specifically this was his dream there is nothing a day nothayin there s nothing you can day t n a daa rhyan had south pacific and sommer stock and some dinner theatr but it really was not coming together the way he wanted it to from the beginning he knew he needed a back of plan he' started looking for a job in finance after all what is a princeon to gree good for if not making money he interviewed at six companies but he only got a call back at one think everyone else who applied there from princeton they ill got offer jobs i called and they would were not can offer me a job and why why not ni was really really upset and and thought i could change his mind or some hes well it is seems yu now people seem to think that you er you would really rather be acting and im you kee wha do not you leave that up to me i need money to act he needed a day job but the day job wanted him to act he was stuck in new york working part time at a mal order bible company and part time at an opper ys side bar now rhyan enjoyed a delicious beverage from time to time and when he drank ither after a shift or sometimes during everyone paid attention to him he would make joke s and balland shot glasses on his head he owned the room i mean iave always been a typiga that people would invite to parties to weddings i people would offer when i had no money and i was hanging out with my buddies from prince tanyi wull make him bank in com an were going out to the bar i got on evy money lik i'll pay for your drinks i wanc you i come out and it it was not even much i was such a great friend of is peopludge to funny as drunk people wanted the funny as trunk around a and and i jus barbacking in i would always goofaround and i occasionally get get old drunk and and dance of people and yway the djay there was has his own dega company and he would do weddings and parties inself that he took me on and rhyanjoind a shadow industry of party professionalists the kind you might meet on resorts or on yachts leading serve side limbo competitions were at reunions and couraging people to dance people whose job iat is to force ustinto ract to touch one another to have fun because apparently this is something weve forgotten how to rhyan paid his dues working barmets was worganizing group games dressing up as woody from toystory complete with a big plastic head over his own head and then he got the call from hosek quervo theye were running a tug boat called the untamed spirit too for short boozecreises out of sandiego and they wanted him on it his job would be to entertain winners of various hosa quer of a promotional contests and i turned out they pretty much enjoyed the same things te thirteen year olds did myness the big plastic head and plustikela and ryon but drink too was the envy of all my peers a really i and eventually the opportunity came to do at full time and the tough port about it was that i was n't have to give up acting any pretence i had of peing an actor was gone cause it was anynot om not doin it as lik litz makes a money doing something that is close to acting and a s i went with it ryon had entered the party's own liy i a my ra e a oas the wer in the house to night i think mi i that from youth s go gi a's ry wer s ta bles another ard i's e o a a for monnery sports bar is on route twenty four and union dale long island hoster university is near by but this part of union dale is not much a college town as it is a college strip a black top spoke of suburban sprawl with monorays on the corner next to a guns and ammo shop next to a starbuks inside its dank and cavernis with banners advertising fifteen sent wings and five dollar picters i will learn many important things to night but perhaps most surprising as this people and bars apparently need quervoteachers and many shot glasses in order to live erand to get them they will do unimaginable things iii ai iias let me set the soon rhyan is standing at the backet of crow bar he is torn off his bla break the way ut mance to rebeol a very tight speed out stuffed with teachers and then how shall i put this young women crouch down in front of him take hold of a shirt with their teeth and pull i li yo li ca woman at alk about i had not bargain i de it a oneiif rhyne's not getting grows teachers out of his pants he serving them shots off his head my level with their bros or asking them to lickis scowl were just rubbing up against him i maybe it is because he seems to nor mischievous compredatory or maybe it is because he comes with the sanction and strange dem i celebrity of a well known liquor brand but grhyne as able to do in say things in the name of quervot it woill get you arrested in the most circumstances and as antic's arngest tolerate they are adored i i i my had right in a gan agan aan quer vonation i would have described him as a kind of corporat gester but as i watchwomen gleefully french him and then wander casually back to their boy friends a betterwoord comes to mine he is a sater the half man half piest concert at dyonisis god of drunken revelry and not just because he is got a hairy back e trenne li li i li friendly i me lik a i oi a wi a i i a and if you have not guessed already this is the other reason i'mfascinated by rhyan's job while the rest of the barred rhyne dances and flirts and watches sports an the thirty odd t vs at monerays i've somehow managed to pint myself next to the single screen that is inexplicably tune to pep s specifically reburns is documentary of new york rhyan on te other hand is out there moving in a world in thi commercs and pleasure and liquor and secs or al intimately and uncritically in twine and everyone is having a wicked good time it is a world in which i normally do not travel and rhyan is my ticket in when he runs out to his car for last man at techer resupply i realize that this is my chance to try my hand at satertom i get a tray of shots from the woman has been helping rhyon and i start making the rounds a i aei yo one try wone of these ther the yea from quer bo no evi i i i o o oh yow elets go and i do follow r but when we find er friends they all just stare at me maybe it is not clear i say do you want free to kula and they just say no thanks a i i can do i a o nomthing i if there is one thing i should not be hard to give away in a bar it is free drinks and yet as i go from corner to corner no one is drinking off my head no one is pulling anything out of my part of the problem is i'm not ryn an maybe i should shave my head and loosen up a little but beyond that but i do not realize until i'm out their doing it is as much as i love to drink and as much as i love was ta cirvof to kula and as much as i'd love another free trip to quar vonation i feel weary pushing some big company's message that is slamming down shots is a great game the drinking always equals fun which even rhyn knows is an exactly true because one thing i have not mentione yet and probably should have is ther rhyan does not drink at least not any more ow is mollom as yn oin oi n i he haves o mo not littl lin sa goin alim noin n o nims o tim be yon not a o one a b m tender god in a en do one ben roun to wit tasty mogerida wo tak wherv te hart of rhyan back is wriding new lyrics to existing rockswos it described the pleasures of drinking cuervol or give very precise directions on had to do a body shot here is an example shots with her without training wheels quervo does not hurt it heels it is a little unnerving to hear knowing that the person who wrote these lerics as the same person who quit drinking more than a year ago in part because he was afraid that it might kill him he was kicked out of a hotel in florida for throwing a table off the balcony in saine louisy blacked out in the middle of a promotion and a quervonation he got loaded he cursed out an elderly guest he was supposed to be entertaining irwas it an older guy probably na sixties and they were professional contest winners and he ist talking at dinner about all these other contests he wane and how this one was nicer than this one and an bovin it sound he is complaining a little bit about something and i was whan't you shut up 's a free freckin trap old man o kay why do not you take your professional contest winnin attitude to shove it up your and the next day i woll cuplik i know i says somethin ol the problem for rhyoan was that in most cases that is very bad to be caught drinking on the jobs but in rhyan's case it only made a more successful the wilder and drunker he got the more bars wanted him back the more querva one am back and what amazes me is that at the time rhyan was deciding to get sober quervo asked him to sign on for another hundred promotional gigs over the course of the coming year and ryan said ow about one fifty that is every wee cant almost half the year spent in bars to keela on his head to keel a spilling down his face it must be eve working in the apple factory in its ownd by snakes how does it feel as someone wo dozen drink any more to be confront ed on a nightly basis with people who might be the drunk and hurting former you i just do not think about it all that much because it there is nothing i can do about it either way and i just do not know think that is it i m i cannot make any judgment i means is nobody that i could tell you that gy needs to stop drinking and know it for shure i can certainly say ligoi gi reminds me of me an o that that happens a lot im but when it comes down to i just now it is up to them agis it is not my call rhyans a hundred and fifty day barhot for querva is almost over his current contract is coming to a close and he is now working on a new very different project im sonic gma whatas yon yi save youll ga i to panastonisonic hev this is a telivision ad for the panasonic sonic shaper max electric shaveand which rhyan plays a character called sonic nan he got the gig from someone o saw im doing a querf a promotion and a lot of it is the same he jumps around in public costing people yelling at them convincing them of the superiority of this particular brandif shaver by hopping into fountains and getting spral ohe shy but if it sounds as if there is no difference think of this first people do not generally drink while they are shaving and second rhyn's an actor now an actual actor with national exposure a good agent making decent money the back of plan is brought him back to his original plan and i'm happy form but also kind of sad put it this way i still kind of wane to be querl man but i do not think i'd ever want tof be sonic man the fact is ryan leeping something behind the boos onviously and that is a good thing but also the boccamalian power of the boose itstanger we contradictions ud made quirical man more than a day john i'll little kind of inspired extension o ryng himself which is to say te kind of ar sots com out anis o o i wonder now that hes the actor yo always wanted to me i got it yeu'll ever get a rolling out as god as the wanes already plain i ro thets com out fthes rot o o my foner o e fro beoun on o et a a rake up to god that story and this weeks entire pirgrimma first brodcastback in two thousand to since then quivernation is closed now ryan now lives in long beach california with his wife and five year old son he says hofs been sober for eighteen years now and he has got in some work as an actor yes plan a

totally felt the perfect solution to the problem of d making friends as you get older because it is really as you get older i'm not that old but the thing i miss most as an adull is tis time is it is time is valuable now and you do not gou to have the same conversations that you did when you were an high school where you would be on the phome with some one for eight hours a night or you would to stay up and stall night long and tell every single thing that ever happened to you and yit was even less that had happened to you because you were fifteen years old nd yitwas just ik much talking much bonding bonding conding bonding and asn't a dult you just do not have they to chance to do that very much and then ow an now we ret now now we are realy good friends since then lik got an unchon all of her references i i feel lie i've known her much longer than i have but but is iis not is not kind of the point of of being friends of somebody that when they tell you this information that it happens an a conversation that that is that that is not if back fround for the french but that actually is sir y i mean i mean some good sure but but frends the pastof i the i could not that that it differein sometimes because i gets to a point where you just have all these kind of bottled stories i got tisboy frend he did this and i have this boy for nee ded this and it meant this and it meant that and whine op os put those stories on a caset tapetust when listen to all once starley kine coming up stock puplets diling for stake and kidnipping is plan be in a minute from chcog abov a gradio whent our programm continues to smar can lie from our a glass you took on a progrim of course we choose some theme bring your at variety of different kinds of stories on that theme today show plan b stories of people ditching their expectations and living inside a back up plan as must of us do we have arrived at act three of our programm that three when kidnapping his plan be even now i think out bery keen and has a hard time thinking of himself as a kidnapper you grap in sudthen california and allabim my to high school withth children of movy stars and other superrich people and if you could say that he had a plan for his life he hadchieved a lot of it by the age of twenty two was thearly nineteen sixties he was youngest member of the las angulist stock exchange het successulwe put to gethis in realistatedeas he was making a lot of money but he doll streaded drinking heavily i be came an tdicted perkadam another pain killers you course if your drinking and taking strong pan killers you get bery numbed out and a on a good day you might have an hour of rational thinking quote on quote rational thinking and then also the market had a big down turn and a late sixty two early sixty three and my real estate deals went sour in a period of six months i went from earning about in the neighborhood of ten thousand month nineteen sixty three dollars to a a trying to sell transparent window shades dor to dore to stores in the middle of the desert and it is nineteen sixty three your halowed at that pint twenty three s you have gone brok at twenty three and then you come up with this plan be well one day i decided while i have to do something radical and in my demented state suddenly it came to me that a the way to sosolve my problems was to i aget some money somehow and i would have to be illegally because i was obviously incapable of raising money for my realistate projects an security's projects i came across in al kidnapping was same a good idea and i put a business plan together and went to my a waywa a a kid napbing si a a good idea and you put a business planned together yes i was very business or and and it was i never referred to it as a kidnapping it was going to be it was the plan of operatioand was kind an under writing a securities under wriding but i had to go take somebody is kid in order to raise the money to invest in business propositions and the course in or to be being a good catholic the only way i could get rid of the sin was to pay the money back ultimately you knw you knas that you you say that kidnapping seemoc a reason abelochand was not there any part of it that kind of horrified you no because in my a in my drug in due state you might say i m it to a it i i knew i was not get a hurt anybody and therefore it was not going to be a crime as far as my moral character was concern and as long as i was willing to pay the money back and and was absolutely not gun to hert anybody than seemed those o ka s men to who you decided to kidnat well i went down the list of all the wealthy people i knew and who had kids that i knew there was victy douglas his father i was see el of douglas air craft that was eliminate au she was a girl a jim mitchon aknew me too well and his father robert michon he kow his rich one month and then broke the next and a then arthur lake whos father was johnny wise meller all these people that had famous parents and now i went down the list than finally i i thought of nancy and a grancy nancisanatra the oldest daughter of franks on notran and a then i of course junior and of course i i say juniorn on referring to franks notr junior frank seniors son and had you met him before i had seen him i mean i knew nancy and high school and and junior high and a had been to her home several times and knew that that the sun who was a way at boarding school was sort of distant from the girls the girls were doted upon the junior was saw all as sort of out of the picture how much ran teme money you we v en ask a two hundred and forty thousand that wu i i made a list of all the money we needed both for investments and the help my parents and im it came out two ode in forty thousand dollars since is gon o have to pay a back i did not want a raise more money than i could easily pay back and you decided you wentin to you we gin to take the money and then you can do what to makeut back i was going to invest and in real estate projects inwest te los angeles and ind a the specific stock as gan invest in was crisler at the time which was in the toilet and a course made a spectacular come back and at various several different stocks and some real estate which ultimately became arina dellray the world's largest marina and if in in fact if iad by some miracle had ever gotten the money and in id effact invested would have turned out the way th i had it out line on my business plan the investments were actually fairly prudent it just was the concept was a little off and and is you were ing o take this capwital yu were in invest in this staff and then you an make a profit ofer i guess a couple years ra you would be about as a five year plan and then in the end of five years you were oing to give the money back to sonatra ys set send the money back to franksonnotra and just imagining the reaction that he and the f bi would have when the ransom money starts coming back to m and jjust explain how the plan of operation was gin to ge how the whole thing would come off whereverybody would be at the end house ol ki ter was an index a in a threewing binder with the indexes and o one of the sections was the benefit to the sonotra family and i would bring father and son closer to gether and at the times on otra was being investigated for his connections with the mob and money landering through the caleny va lodge and sands a casino and los fagus and i thought well thas might i even help him there you may not have it help his image yes help th helpes because i felt that if the public would perceive him as a worried parent rather than a a famous singer hanging out with the moffa a woulds cast him in a more favorable image and that was one of the things i listed in the benefits of the sonotra family the thing but that planbarry is is that o it in a way it is utterly logical it just proceeds from a pramis that crazy i same people do not wake up one day in desithing in go kidn out the most famous entertainer in the world who has nown mofia connections and you can have the f bi and the mofi after you the same people do not do that and particularly thinking that there can a benefit the victims as well as their own family when ask bery kan in to tell me what happened when he tried to put his plan be into a fact and do the kidnapping he is de such pains to get the truth of it a cross to me and to preve especially that the blame for the crime falls entirely on him and ot on to pousat he enlisted help with the kidnapping an destraight is filled with fart tom any details and takes far longer then we can spend here suffies tit desay that it was a comedy of errors ind desember of nineteen sixty three the twenty three yoard keen in and a friand nab the nineteen year old franks an atrerginior was performing it lake taha hennt accidentally left his gun in son otris hotelhim he did't have any cash to by gas or to get away car during the get away his buy get climed out of the car into a snestorm and knocked himself out by running into a tree brance when the caut franks an octra senior and demandad ransom sand i tr offered them a million dollars and they tried to talk him down to two hundred forty thousand as thats what it set in the plan we sent frank to a gas station payphone to get the next instructions about how to get a sun back no franks noctra senior and the f bi go racing down the carson city thirty minutes away and in about fifteen minutes jon started calling for frank sonotra to the gas station and the mechanic at the gas station who was busy in by himself i kept answering the phone and this c aller was asking for franksonot to the most famous entertain of the world time and the guid got very angry when this caller was calling back time and again for franksonotra he thinks it is a funny fonco e i thinks it is a prank of some sort and as soon as he hung up from the third time after letting john have it with four letter words the before you can gets back toos car in screeches two aftere i cars and franksonotr senior jumps out of the cards as might ans franksonotrhav i had any calls and you can imagine the the the reaction hat that poor mechanic had finally one more time and john call back and this time frank answered the fone and johns told him what othe next step was gon to be berry did it did it occur to you that the person who you were kidnapping and their family would be tromatized and and emfrightened no because the waig that the plan of operation was design in the way i wrote it out in the script it was always supposed to be just between franks and otra senior franksonoter junior my group of people and the af bei the the mother and sisters were not to be involved in the kidnaping and and i based upon what i knew about franksnotr senior and the family and forth i did not think that he would let his wife know if he thought the kidnapping was going to be resolved in a matter of a few hours i wonder if the fact that you constructed such an elaborate web of loject with out your business plan that that made the kidnopping seemed reasonable and even good for the sanatres i wonder if that prevented you at the time from comprehending what you were putting them throughm absolutely i had i rationalize than justified i i had god's approval anthe sing was being divinely blessed what was the sign that it had god's approval on can dot god talk to me particulaly when i would go to church and light a candle and be still and i would hear in god talking to me an sad telling me what i had to do and he was very definite about nobody could be hurt and a had to pay the money back as you have got an older and soberd op and gotten wiser does god still talk to you oh no no that went away when i got sover and also got syciatric help il when i hear voices nowadays i do not pay any attention to him after successfully getting two hundred forty thousand dollars in ransom money and returning franksn octergunior safely home berry cang in his accomplishes were caught kanim was sentenced to life was seventy five years but was released after just four years because he psyceactric valuation found that he was legally insane at the time of his time he returned to the real estate business we was wildly successful became a millionaire a few years ago he soled his kidnapping straight to the movy studios for several times more than the original ransom a he should his papers indicating that poll of his profits from the sail would go to charity and says that he agreed to a movideal only to set the record straight about a lie that he told during his trial back in the nineteen sixties bak then he says he spread a rumor that the kidnapping was only a publicity stunk stage by the senatres

want en ac bor a fate must of us feer yoears ago living in canada jonathan guldstine had a job selling the montreel gazette newspaper of the telephone was at ormal kind of plan be that must of us had at one point or another and when he took the job he did not realize that it would become a ten year chapter in his life when you 're a little kid you never decided that one day you are going to be a telemarketer it is not something that you plan it just happens the way going ball just happens whore the way falling down a flight of stairs just happens one minute you'r at the talp of the landing and the next you are at the bottom and you will be damned if you can remember each one of the individual steps that led you between the two all during the time i was working at the gazette i found it nearly impossible to bring myself to tell anyone i was a telemarketer when people asked what it was i did for a living i simply say that i was assales in andwhen they asked what it was that i sold i would say dreams and then i would look at them for a moment whisically then i would say thati was only joking and then they would tay op and i would become uncomfortabland then they would become uncomfortable then they would stop asking me any thig as you might expect the hard thing about working at the gazette was that there was just much rejection even though you were calling almost two hundred people a day ninety eight percend of who wanted to see you dead you still had to bring a certain hopefulness to each call a feeling that this one the call you were making right now could be the one it was almost trying to hypnotize yourself and to believing that something a certain to say ravity did not exist and the next time you drop the apple it will not fall to the ground but it will float up into the sky a helium bloon i would often pretend the people on the other end of the line were sok puppets to soften the sting of their hang up i want shared this thought with a girl who hoad just started working there preten there is a little salk puppet on the other end i encouraged all cute with coat button eyes holding the phone in his mouth she considered the logic of this for a momend how does he talk with a phone in his mouth she asked and for this i really did not have an answer in the pitching room we all wore these headsets that were connected to computers as soon as we hung up the computer automatically diale the next number that we were always speaking to some one without respit our boss was a man named ray and if you made two or three sales a day then you were doing o kay and ray would not scream at you generally i found the repetitiousness of the job comforting you are nevere had a loss for words you always know what you are going to say because what you were going to say is hi my name is jonathan and i wanted to know if you are interested in reading the gazette newspaper one time a woman who answered the phone would not believe i was not a friend of hers named christopher stop playing around christopher she said but i'm not christopher i responded will you cut it out christopher after several minutes of this i had to hang up on her i knew that christopher was going to get it for that from my very first week at th gazette i was surprised to discover that i had a natural gift for sales whatever i was and whatever askedpirations i had before i started working there i became an instant gazette ledgen some times selling up to ten subscriptions in the course of a shift i got on the phone of g people and i made the want to listen i joked you ce mand in flurted with th women i jentlly cajoled them bundling the mup in my good strong tell marketting arms and toss them up into the air where they scream delightedly only to land back down with the brand new gazettes s girtion i would look aro owned me at the other sat saks ind the pitching room and wonder how they could go on to screeping by with their two or three sales a day tell a marketing had been my back up land but now i found myself faced with the uncomfortable fact bthat it was what i was truly oid at i got myself a lucky ballpoint pandad spent half a day's pay on he fancy had a shay case to put my leeds in i even had a special way of filling out the order forms that involved clear capital letters and exes never checks and the box as marked mesa or master card there was a bell on ray's desk for when you made a sale and when i made a sale i had a special way of hitting it with the balls of my fingers that made at sound as crisp and clean as a glockansh i always kept to the one tap for sale rule i respected the bell not some of the other guides who rang the crap at t t it they were five year ords riting their first to wheeler the office manager was a man named billy billy was a fat lad mouth greek man in a skin tight huyian shirt wone of billy's jobs was to keep us and spired with peptox billy would explain to us when he first started working at the gazette he was sitting right where we were and that now he makes as much money as a plumber and that in fact we all had the opportunity to make as much as a plumber i'm going out and eating a big fat stake tonight he would say just the way at the end of the day a plumber does eventually as happens to all the mighty i fell heven now i cannot explain it hou brist my diet perhaps i started taking myself too seriously and lost my sense of fun who knows but whatever the case i suddenly found myself desperate for sales that at the end of a shift still with nothing i would order the paper to my own address and than cancel at the following week it is a very real thing the stink of desperation hit is an actual odor and people can smell it over the phone line your jokes become alittle more hurried and forced your confidence a little more false your pauses more awkward i soon found myself gazing longingly at the filled out order sheets clutched in the fist of the new offic superstar a seventeen year old who is phone name was candy who would stroll past my desk coming taken care of business now when i came back from the bathroom during my ship ray would ask me what the hell took long the toilett was for closers a few weeks ago i got home and found this on my answering machine when the tell a marke to realize that there was no wone they are to pitch to he stopped himself but i want you to listen again and notice the long pas before he actually puts the phone down he says hallo he inhals and before he puts the phone down he pauses i some one who sold over the telephone for close to ten years i can tell you that the paws between the hollo and the hang up i's a moment of reprieve hou start to talk you realize you have got in an answering machine and then before you actually hang up hou steal a moment you take shelter in those few seconds before you hit the hang up button and the onslaught of automatically diled phone numbers begins anew delivering the voices of people whoill very soon hate you directly into the earphones of your headset and straight into your brain i played the message over and over listening to it not to better hear the chaos of the pitching room but to try and imagine what was going through his head and at the same time i tried to remember what wen through my own head during those pauses it was always sort of that moment in a har film but a guy who is having his head hell down an a bath tup of water pops up one last time and gos before he has pushed back down and his dround for ever wsince the numbers were automatically dialed you never knew who was going to pop up in your head sad one time i got my friend mark's elnicer on the phone a guy who i had not seen in years mark was in my junior hige hisetd class he used to get excited while playing hogball that hed clutched the ball to his chest and roll around the floor jeweling i tried to keep him on the phone as long as possible never saying who i was gleaning whatever i could about his life i could hear his kids playing around trying to steal the phone from him and all threug out i was shocked by how unfailingly decent he was with me i felt the anonymous stranger who shose up on christmas day to test a family's kindness mark did not by the paper but he did not rush me off either it felt good to know that mark's elnicer had grown up to be a really nice man there was also one time i got my grandmother after several minutes of talking about how weird it was that i had gott in her number out of all the numbers in the city she told me that she had just learned that morning that my grandfather's cancer had come back i looked across the room where billy the manager was eating french fries and some one else was ringing the bell on race dask after i hung up the phone with her not a second later another call popped into my head sad hi am calling from the gazette i sad my grandfather would be dead within the year and then one day i got my own number i cannot explain it better than to say that having that happened is sort of rounding the corner and running into yourself at first you knon't quite recognized that it is you you look a little shorter and less handsome but then all of a sudden in one naked instant you are face to face with yerself uy was the telle marketting dog that it caught its own tell marga and tale the message that i left myself becaue you just cannot resist leaving yourself a message when something the o here i am god this is hawful was is horrible his has to mean something but of course it did not mean any g and then for the next several seconds i listened to silence on the other end of the line my own line as i worried about the rapid fire calls that would start again the moment i hung op when i got back home i had exactly two messages on my machine one was the message from myself i was surprised by how loud the background noise was behind me and how much smaller i sounded than iad imagined all these years the other message was from my mother she was imploring me to go back to school and become a speech there us dout of the goatstain is to hos to th potcast heavy weight whose ne ses and starts and and ai five the

complete unsuitability for the job provides the middle manager with a physical impression to complement the good smell which impression is intensely exciting forcing him to hire her as a supplemental

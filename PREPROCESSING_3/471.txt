welcome to the huberman ladpodcas wths a science science pace to fori m indrewhubermen and i'm a professor of neurbology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day i have the pleasure of introducing doctor matthew walker as our guest on the huberman ladpodcast doctor walker is a professor of neuro science and psychology at the universy of california berkleep there his laboratory studies sleep they scudy why we sleep what occurs during sleep such as dreams and why we dream learning during sleep as well as the consequences of getting insufficient or poor quality sleep on waking states doctor walker is also the author of the international besselling book why we sleep our discussion to day is an absolutely fascinating one for any one that is interested in sleep learning or human performance of any kind doctor walker teaches us how to get better at sleeping he also discusses naps whether or not we should or should not nap whether or not we can compensate for lost sleep and if how to best do that we discuss behavioral protocals and interactions with light temperature supplementation food exercise secs all the variables that can impact this incredible state of mind an body that we call sleep during my scientific career i've read many papers about sleep and attended many seminars about sleep yet my discussion with doctor walker to day reveal to me more about sleep sleep science and how to get better at sleeping than all of those papers and seminars combined i'm also delighted to share that doctor walker has started a podcast that podcast entitled the mat walker podcast releases its first episode this month and is going to teach all about sleep and how to get better at sleeping be sure to check out the mat walker podcast on apple spotify or wherever you listen to podcast before we begin i'd to mention that this podcast is separate fror my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and scince related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponser is athletic greens athletic greens is an all in one vitemen mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve son delighted that their sponsoring the podcast thereason i started taking athletic greens on th reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutricional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might hast in addition it has probiotics which are vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called gut microbiom and the ways in which the micro bi am interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essecialy with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without letic greens i get the vitemens i need the minerals i nee and the probices to support my microbio if you would to try atletic greens you can go to atleti greenstock calm slash hubermen and claim a special offer they will giv you five free travel packs plus a year supply of videmen d three k too thrare ton of datad ow showing that vitemand three is essensial for various aspects of our brain and body health even if were getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficien in viteemin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstock cam slash hubermen to claim the special offer of the fivfree travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratioes of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and petassium but it has no sugar ave talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolies for nerve sell function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodia magnesium and petassium present in the proparatioes all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimize if the electroliytes are not present and ifhydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormont systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that you are getting the proparatioes of electrolites if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is eleement dok calm slash hubermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase they are all delicious again if you want a try elemen you can go to element element do cam slash huberman and now my discussion with doctor mat walker great to finally meet you in person wonderful to connect m i mean its being too long but i suspect it would havebeenisios to time before we have met lest the pandemic nm thank you nowmyou a i'm delighted that we are finally seing down faces to face i've been tracking your work both in the internet sphere and i read your book and loved it and also from the perspective of science you achy came to stamford couple of years ago and gave a electure a for brainmind o ya yee and there of course you talked about sleep in its utility and its challenges and how to a and how to conquer it to speak let us start off very basic what is sleep sleep is probably the singlemost effective thing you can do to reset your brain budy health that is a functional answer intems of now what is sleep intemsof its benefits sleep is a process though is an incrantibly complex physiological balle and if you to recocnize o see what happens to your brain nd your body at night during sleep you would be blown away and the paradox is that most of us and i would think this too if i was not to sleep scientist we go to bed we lose consciousness for seven to nine hours and then we seit of wake up in the morning and we generally feel better and in some ways that denies the physiological and biological beauty of sleep upstairs in your brain when you are going through these different stages of sleep the the changes in brainway of activity are far more dramatic than those that we see when we are awake and we can speak about deep sleep on what happens ther remsleep is a fascinating time which is another stage of sleep often called dream sleep which is rapid eye movement sleep that stage of sleep some part of your brain are up to thirty per cent more active than when you are awake again it is can haf violating this idea that are mind is dormant and our body is just simply quiescent and and resting i would happy to dest of double click on either one of those and also what changes in the body as well but it is an intense evolutionary adaptive benefit ar and system that said though i would almost push back against a and evolved system when we think about the question of sleep and what sleep is our assumption has always bein that we evolved to sleep and have achy question that and i have no water get in a time captuae and go back and prove this but what if we started off sleeping and it was from sleep that wakefulness emerged why do we assume that it is the other way around and i think this probably some really good evidence that sleep may have been the proto state that it was the basic fundamental living state and when we became awake as it were we always had to return to sleep in some ways at that point sleep was the price that we paid for wakefulness and that is another way of describing what sleep is but again i think it sat of denies that the active state of sleep it is not a passive state of sleep either and and then find you can say what what is sleep across different species and in us human beings and in ormemalian species and avian species as well sleep is broadly separated into these two main types and we have got non rapid eye movement sleep on the one hand and then we have got rapid ye movement sleep on the other and we can speak about how they unfold across the night and their architecture bekers it is not just intellectually interesting from the perspective of what sleep is it is also practically impactful for our daily lives and id love to sit o go down that root too but you navigate you dow me i on let us devil end go down that root o you mention how i t of the brain is during certain phases of sleep when i was coming up in science remslee rapid i moveant sleep was referred to as paradoxical sleep yas that still a good way to think about it paradoxical because the brain is active and yet we are essentially paralyzed carrat yet it really is a paradox and where that came from was simply the brainwave recordings that if all i measuring about you is your brainwave activity it is very difficult for me sitting outside of the sleep aboratory room to figure out are you awake worrar you in remsleep because those two pans of brain activity are close to one another you cannot discriminate between them yet he paradox is that when you are awake i go in there and your set of sitting up your clearly conscious in awake but yet when you go interrem sleep you are completely paralyed and that is one of the i think that is part of the paradox but the paradox really just comes down to two dramatically different conscious states yet brain activity is dramatically more similar than different and the way i can figure out which of the two you are in is by measuring two other signals the activity from your eyes and the activity from your muscles when were awake we will occasionally have these blinks and we will have cert of sicads but during rem sleep you have these really bazaare horizontal shuttling eye movements that accur and that is where the name comes from rapid i movements they always horizontal mostly they are horizontials and that is one of the ways that we can differentiate them from other waking i movement activity cause it is not always let can be sometimes horizontal but can also have diagonal and also vertical in that plaine but then the muscle activity is the real dead give awak just before you and to rem sleep your brainstem which is were the dinamics of nonrem and ram are essentially played out and then expressed upstairs in the qartecs and downstairs in the body and when we go into rem sleep and just a few seconds before that happens the brainstem sends a signal all the way down the spinal cord and it communicates with what are called the alphamotonurons in the spinal cord which control of voluntary sclecal muscles and it is a signal of paralysis and when you go into dream sleep you are locked into a physical incarceration of your own body amezn you why why would mother nature do such a thing and it is in some ways very simple the brain paralyzes the body that the mind can dream safely because think about how quickly we would have all been popped out of the geampul yund if i think i'm one of the best sky divers who can just simply fly and i've had some times those dreams too and i get up on my apartment window and i leap out you do not you are done that is one of the sort of that part of the paradox of ram sleep both it is brain activity similarity despite the behavoral state being different and this bazaar lock down of the the sirt of brain of the body itself now of course the involuntary muscles thankfully aunt a paralyzed see you keep breathing your heart keeps beating is this why men have erections during ramsleep and women have vaginal ubrigation during sleep that is one of the reason part of the other reason though there is because of the autonomic activity there is anervous a part of our nervous system called the autonomic nervous system and it controls many of the automatic behaviors and some of those re aspects f are reproductive facilities during remsleep what we later discovered is that you go through these bazaar what we call autonomic storms which sounds dramatic but it actually is when you measure them that you will go through periods where your heart rate decelerates and drops and your blood pressure goes down and then utterly randomly your heart rate accelerate dramatically and what we call the fight or flight branch of the autonomic nervous system or the sympathetic nervous system badly name cause it is anything but sympathetic its very aggravating an that all the sudden fires up and then it shuts down again and it is not in any regular way nd it is when you get those autonomic storms you get very activated from a physiological perspective that you can have these erections and you have fational dischargeics o you are tolal aralyzed but you are still paralyzed there are only am two voluntary sgo at two voluntory muscle groups that are spurred from the paralysis bazaar one your extra ocular muscles because if they were paralyed you would not be able to have rapid eye movements and the other that we later discovered was the inner ear muscle and we have got no good understanding as to why those two muscles groups are spurred from the paralysis it may have something to do with cranial nerve but i a i do not think it is that i think it is perhaps something more sensory related some people of argued that the reason the eyeblls are spurred from the paralysis is because if your ieblls are left for long periods of time inactive you may get things such as oxygen sort of issues in the am equeous orvitorious humor and the iblls have to keen the grainin semdings of the anterior i are i made require movement exactly pimeliclarcoma have dathe saids in and drainage through the anduro chamber but there am speculating i'm also speculating when i aske this am i would imagine that there are states in waking that also resemble slowwave sle were rather that ner states that' slow wave sleep also resembles waking states you have beautifully illustrated how ram sleep can mimic some of the more act of brain states that we achievin waking what sort of waking state that i might have experienced or experience on a daily basis mih look similar to slow wave sleep nonram sleep if any it is genious way of thinking about it turns the tabls i lev it i'm we almost never see anything the the true ultrut slow waves of deep nonrem sleep i'm we spoke about these two stages nonramon ram i'm nonram is further subdivided into four separate stages i'm stages on through for increasing in tha depth of sleep stages three and for that is what we typicalle called deep nonrm sleep stages one and two i mabn' take me through the ark of a night just they i u i i put my head down i well for you wat what is i'm you normanly go to sleep i'm usually sit of around about ten thirty p m gy and usually i'll naturally wake up said of a little bit befor seven sometimes befor six forty five or seven i haven alarm set for i'm seven o for i'm a m youree here folks ma a an as usein alarm a i really an really i'm usualy e rion mand it but he does use it yei usuallusualy liman after a oh i am human im and and i've have my sleepfishes and i'd left to speak about that too but i'm it is only just in the event that i'm cause i to keep regularity to you have got to keeph those two things in balance and seven o for just because why not be atiosincractic i do not know why we always set things on these a hod numbers yep when you mi sleep round ten thirty yosing you is an example im aus i imagine a number of people go to sleep at different times with ten thories about when i go slev eleven as for me but i'm you go to sleep at ten thirty sover that first i'm let us say three hours of sleep what is the architecture of that sleep look as compared to the last three hours of your sleep ar before morning ye i should knote that that is if ten thirty to seven that is just based on mi cron a type an my preferential it is different for different people i'm not suggesting that that is the perfect sleeps but for humanities sleep it is just my but i'magin most plople probably go to sleep somewhere between ten an p m an midnight ets o abouly li ninht and mi nighe ive a m and seven a m were or five thirty and seven thirty ye ye i'm at least in if you look at the first welt nations that is that is a typical sleep profile i' when i first full asleep i'll go into the light stages of nonrem sleep stages one and two of nonrem inm then i'll start to descend down into the deep e stages of nonrem sleep after about maybe twenty minutes an starting to head down into stage three nonrem and then into stage for nonrem sleep and as i'm starting to fall asleep as i've cast off from the ard usually with me murky waters of wakefulness a'm and i'm in the shallows of sleep stages one and two my heart rate starts to drop a little bit and then my brainway patern activity starts to slow down normally when i'm awake it is going up and down may be twenty thirty forty fifty times er second am as i'm going in to light nonrem sleep it will slow down to maybe fifteen twenty and then really starts to slow down down to abouts at o ten or eight cycles per second eight cych or waves per second then as i'm starting to move in two i'm stages three and four nonrem sleep iseveral remarkable things happen all of a sudden my heartrat really does start to drop oh and i'll come back to temperature i'm going to write temperature downcas i always forget these things and now i'm sardly in the foothills of middle age an as i'm starting to go into those deeper stages of nonrem sleep all of a sudden hundreds of thousands of cells in my quartex all deside to fire together and then they all go silent together and it is this remarkable physiological coordination of the likes that we just do not see at joring any other brain state anstrillientually having recorded from the brains of of animals and allorbit from humans an onthing i've ever seen the entire cordecs or even entire regions of grotacs light up that it is it is snunning it is it is almost this mutreful sort of mantrechand an all this surt of to slow in hal and then a meditative exhal in hal exhale and these waves are just enormous in their size an the body is capable of movement at this time there is nos paralysis there is no paralysis but for the most part muscle tone has also dropped significantly terest at that point and then you will or i will then stay there for about another twenty or thirty minutes now i'm may be sixty or seventy minutes into my first sleep cycle and then i'll start to rise back up back up into stage two nonrem sleep and then after about eighty or minutes i'll pop up and i'll have a short rem sleep period and then back down i go again down into nonrem up into rem and you do that reliably repeatedly and i will be doing that and i do do that every nighty minutes at least that the average for most adults it is different in different species what changes to your question is the ratio of nonrem to rem within that ninety minutes cycle as you move across the night and what i mean by this is in the first half of the night the majority of those ninety minute cycles are comprised of lots of deep nonrem sleep that is when i get my stage three and four of deep nonrem sleep once i push through to the second half of the nig ght now that ceaseful balance changes and instead the majority of those ninety menute cycles a comprised either of this lighto form of nonrem sleep stace too nonrem sleep ia'm much more and increasingly more rapid i movement sleep and the implication that i was t of speaking about pragmatically is let us see that i'm i have to and i usually never to atly morning flights or red eyes i'm just because i'm a mass if that happens i'm not suggesting up of the people should not i'm suggesting tis oll not do that a im i've taken a red eyer i've done that two or three days later i get some sort of general feeling malays my brain does not work as well i i think red i should be abolished i for the pilots too i mou kno and oh an we can for the about those andy erers theinergency remembing long shifts have been shown to lead to ou kno physician induced a errors that il lead to lot of fatalities i'm in their lot of reasons why staying up too long or being up at the wrong times if you are not adapted to is just terrible the datrinoll of those cases i'm particular physicians too there was some recent day to looking at suicide ality i'm the rates of suicide in training physicians a youv thoug far above the noum and i do not suspect that the chetuals o helping them i suspect that sleep is a missing thought of that explenetory equation but i teach medical students and and they the're phenomenal but they yather under extremely challenged conditions it is i should not put them undrno itas not it is not optimizing performingis im i've one srry i mus scir no no this is is importanthese it is an important digression i have one question which is your saying that as across the night a greater percentage of these ninety minute cycles are going to be occupied by rem sleep as you progress through the night i'm aware that there a based on work that you have done an and i and from your public education efforts and others im that we have caled circadian forces and we have other forces that are driving when we sleep and when we want to sleep et cetera without going into the details of those of a simple question the experiment is the fallowing let us say god forbid you are prevented from going to sleep at your normal time yand you stay up for the four hours or five hours that normally you would be in predominantly slowway of sleep ye if let say you finally get to lie down at three a m a time when normally your sleep would be occupied mostly by rapid i movement sleep ye will you experience a greater percentage of rapid i movement sleep because of these called circadian forces meaning that is what is appropriate for that time or will your system need to start at the beginning of the race that were nas is i'm referring to it ir calling sleep if for if that is not cleared anybody bas on to masking as if you are force to skip the slowwave sleep part of the night will your system le p into rabit i movment sleeper does it have to start at the beginning and get slowwave sleep first in other words does one sleep state drive in antry to the next sleep state great question there is some degree of recaprosity between the sleep states i should note that when we drive one of those up we often but not always see a a change in the other there are some pharmacologies that have shown an independence to that and we have also playdroum with things temperature and sometimes you can nudge one and not seem to upset or pertub the other but to your i'm i think lovely point the answer is it is a mix but it is most sleep the latter meaning you will mostly go into your rem sleep phase is and be significantly deficiont in your deep sleep just because i start my sleep cychle at three a m rather than at ten thirtep p m it does not mean that my brain just as well i've got a programm and i'm just going to run the programm and the way the programm runs is that we always start with first couple of hours of deep sleep we just got a begin at number one seen one it does not do that now i will get some deep sleep to begin with and part of that is just because of how sleep works based on how long i've been awake longer i'm awake there is a significantly greate a pressure for deep sleep but we actually use exactly what you just described as an experimental techniqu to selectively deprive peeple of one of those stages of sleep or the other we will do first half of the night deprivation and then let you sleep the second half that means that you will be most sleep deep sleep deprived and you will still get most sleep all of your rem sleep and then we switch it you only get your first four hours which means you will mostly get deep non rem sleep but you will get almost no rem sleep in both of those groups they have both had four hours of sleep the difference between them in termes of an experimental outcome is not the sleep time because they have both slept for the same amount it is the contribution of those different stages now we actualy have more elegant methods for sot of selectively going in there and scooping out different stages of sleep but that is the way we used to do at old school was just using this timing difference and who suffers more o those that lack the early phase owd were those that lack the later phayse of the night sleep in other words if i have to sleep only four hours for whatever reason on my better off getting the early part of the night sleep or the second half of the nights depends on what the out com measure is im that gets right to the differences between slowwave sleep and rem ray i i was a probably misinformd but my understanding a very trude understanding i should i should say before i i much da ols contra wit some os at you how wich is that ther very as of you but that the the first part of the night the slowave sleep is restorative to the musculature to motor learning and that the dream content ents to be less emotional the second half of the night be more emotional dreams and sort of the unparring of the emotional load of our previous day and other experiences another words if i were to depreme myself deprive myself cuse me of rem i would be hiperemotion all night maybe night as settled with the kind of experiences of my life whereas ofbo deid myself of slowave sleep i would i'm feel of o more physical malays s that corrector is that far to sand won and if it is too simple please i tell me where i'm wrong no i think much of that is correct and it is sit of that plus for example during deep nonrem sleep that is where we get this it is almost a form of natural blood pressure medication and when i take that away from you the next day were usually going to see autonomic disfunction were usualy going to see abnormalities and heartrate blood pressure we also know that during deep nonrem sleep that there is a certain control of specific hormones for example we know that the insolen regulation of sort of metabolism a meaning how will you luck from a regulated blood shook a perspective versis disregulated prediabetic luck of profile that is where deep sleep seemstemativ we selectively deprive you of that e gloseg on him growth formers different atcully that is that is a beausiful demonstration were growth hormon seems to be more remsleep dependent and that is why we can come on to the effects of alcohol in thes the somreally impressive frightening daturon on alcohol in its disruption of am of sleep but then we also know testosterom pique levels of testostrone happened during remsleep the second half of the night it as sai a second half of the night it really just means that the your profile of mental and physical disfunction we will be different under both of those conditions which one would you prefer i would prefer neither of them and it really depends on what your trying to optomise for it is it is just complecent of sleep is just plori potent it is physiologically systemic that it is almost impossible not to undergo one of those two things just deep sleep deprovation or just rem sleep deprovation and not show a profile that you would really prefer to avoid and that is that that is the reason from an evolutionary standpoint that weave preserve those stages of sleep i mean sleep is just idiotic from an evolutionary perspective or maybe waking as it ean ol wait e hers i e ye i te on your previi dli talking toa come in is very pacific to me i yet i am normally i've always in idiot whem waking but i think this this idea that sleep is profoundly debt tro mental to us if you to take it at face value you are not finding a mate you are not re producing you arenot foraging for food youe not caring for you young and worst of all you have funderable tepredation on any one of those grounds sleep probably should have been selected against but it was not sleep has fogt its way through heroically every step along the evolutionary path and ther for every sleep stage has also surfive just best we can tell what that means is that those are non negotiable if mother nature had found away to even just set of thin sly some of that sleep from us there would have been fast i'm sure evolutionary benefits but looks ast though she has not and i'm usually in favor of her wisdom after three point six million years tat's it is incredible i want i introduca another a godonkan ex prom another thought experiment in this art of the night i sloways sleep predominates early in the night and then rem sleep there is a sanareo that many people including myself experience on a regular basis which is they go to sleep seeming just fine three four hours intit they wake up they wake up for whatever reason mab there 's a noise may be the temperature is not right we will certainly talk about sleep hygene et cetera they get up they go to the restrom they might flip on the nights they might not they will get back in bed hopefully they are not picking up their phone and strartin to rouse and wake up the brain through various mechanisms light an cognime stimulation et cetera they go back to sleep let us say after about ten fifty mentes they are able to fall back a sleep then they sleep till their more typical wate time e how detrimental is that wake up episode or or im event in terms of longevity learning et cetera i would love to sleep the entire night through every night but most nights i do not and yet i feel pretty good throughout the day some days better than others e if you were to at ave a value ate that waking api sod in compare it to sleeping the whole night through what are your were your thoughts on that i think if you are waking up frequently as your describing i would probably get your estate in order because my guess is within the next year ber gin to be you can to be done for no i'm kitting absolutely kitting you it is perfectly natural an normal particularly as we progress with age your children tend to have i'm typically more continuous sleep now it is not that they aun't waking up for brief periods of time they are and in fact we all do when we come out the other end of our sleep cycl at the end of our rem sleep period of the ninty minute cycle almost every b dy wakes up and we make a postural movement we turn over because we have been paralyze for long and the body will also to shift if we are a look around we re open our rs position you somesometimes people will open their eyes but usually it is only for a brief period of time and they usually never commit those awakenings to memory you'r situation and it is my situation as well i usually now at the sage of life i do not sleep through the night i'll usually have a bathroom a break and hen i'll come back that is perfectly normal we tend to forget that in sleep science we think of sleep efficiency of the total amount of time that you are in bed how much of that per cent time is spent asleep and we usually look two numbers that are above eighty five per cent or more as a healthy sleep efficiency if you to think abow me going to bed and i spend let us say eight and a quartet eight and a half hours of time in bed with a normal healthy slep efficiency i still may be only sleeping a total of seven and a half hours or seven and three quarter hours meaning that i'm going to be awake in total not in one long bod but i'm going to be awake for upwards of thirty minutes nat some time some times that can be after a ten minute dalliants after having gone to the bath room and i'm just gradually drifting back off again or the times it will just be for a couple of minutes and most of those you do not commite i think we need to stop we do not need to get too worried abowt you knw periods of time awake just because whene not sleeping throughout the night i would love to do that ton i remember when i that used to happen in it still happens youeveryat oly your great md ad ot it is lovely things tas surprise right and yot not go now a lrise the hall night yoner it is a surpriser but for the most part i think we can be more relaxed about that where we have to be a bit more attentive tho is if you are spending long periods of time not being able to get back to sleep and usually we ty fine that by saying if it is been twenty twenty five minutes normally that is a time when we wuld really say i'll gay let let us explore this what is going on let us see what is happening the other thing is if it is happening very frequently even if you are am not awake for twenty five minutes stretches but you'r finding yourself waking up and being consciously awere that you have woken up for may be six seven or eight times throughout the night and you'r sleep is very what we call fragmented the great science of sleep in the past five or ten years has has been yes quantity is important but quality is just as important and you cannot ha ave one without the other in times of a good beneficial next day out come you cannot just get four hours of sleep but brilliant quality of sleep and be unimpat nor can you get eight hours of sleep but have very pool quality of sleep and be unimpat the next day that is why i just sot of one to asteris this idea of let us not get too worried about waking up and having some time awake that is terfectly normal and natural but if it is happening very frequently throughout the night all those periods of tme a long stretches of time upwards of twenty five minutes then let us look into it i can assure you just helped a lot of people i feel better about this waking up episode that i and many other people experientes i i am because i cause i think it is a really important that we i think i've been desperately guilty of perhaps alyon being too puritanical about sleep and aand i've i've retrospected and i've tried to explore why this was the case you kno it was almost sleep or else dot dot dot and at the time when i was stucting to write the book which was back in too thousand and sixteen you sleep was still a neglected step sister in the health conversation of to day and i cl desicern old gan the and it is changing and not because it to my effits y i will say holly i will say well i it is a great that you give an attribution to your thet other people involved in of course it is a big field but i think you have done a great service by cuing people to the importance of this state not just for avoiding troublesome out comes but also for optimizing their waking state it is really i i vew sleep as this here that feels good but were not aware of how it feels when we are in it necessarily ye im has tremenous benefits when you'r doing it well to speak and has tremendous dephisits when when were not and i think i think it was an important thing for you to do to cu people to this issue and i would say mission accomplished that people are aware of the need for sleep i think that knowing that waking up in the middle the night is normal provided t's not too frequent is is great and will also help people who may have been overly concerned about that i i do one useis as an opportunity raise something about the called ubermen scadul not have yu anifyounet with te huberman as cadl im fortunately knowin i has confused those yet im some years ago there was a discussion about the called ubermen scdul meaning the superman schadul that hubermen without an ach which i have nothing to do with yo read your nici this w this will have a subtext but regardless m the ubermenscadule as i understand is one in which the person elacs to sleep in ninety men it bouts spread throughout the day and night in an attempt to get more productivity am ind or reduce they are over all sleep need there was a paper publish recently that explored whether or not this is good or bad for us maybou just it give us the taco message on that yes of these upemen a sheduels and thes lots of different forms of that they trie to essentially pi chot the twenty for our period into short bouts of sleep with some short o or no well slightly longer periods ove wakefulness than short bouts of sleep than wakefulness you'r i said have made i think equip it is almost your sleeping a baby in cause that is the way that abe nighet in ninety min ll tipes that they 'll have these brief naps then ther're awake then ther're a sleep then there wake and to the chigrin of parents across the night it is basically the same ther're awake they are sleep they are awake to sleep and that is more the the cheduel that these types of protocals ave i have suggested and there was a realy great comprehensive review that found not only that they went necessarily helpful but they were actually raly quite detrimental andon almost every performance met trick whether it be task performance whether it be physiological out come measures whether it even be the quality of the sleep that they were having when they were trying to get it all of those were in a danwid direction and it is not surprising if you look at you'r the way that your physiology is programmed if you look at the way your cicadian rhythm is programmed none of that screams to us that wep should be sleeping in that way why chuckling because we always here sleep a baby this is our babys sleep and a i would say do not sleep a babys sleep an adult be i means te get get your solat eight hours to the a crystals line whosa a a long standing suffering a in someny acusess i sleep a baby am awake every twenty minutes and i think this is another one of those demonstrations that when you fight biology you normally lose and the way you have lost is disease sickness and impeiment and i think if you sleep in accordance with the natural biological edict that we have all been given life tends to be both of a hier quality and along a duration i agree along those lines am im as a vision scientists i've been very excited by the work on these anon image forming cells in the eye the call molonops and cells that an n the brain about tie circadian time of day and i'm a big proponing of people getting a some sunlight ideally sunlight but other forms of bright light in their eyes early in the day and when they want to be awake you essentialy during the phase of their twenty four hour circadian cychael when temperature is rising and then starting n get less light in their eyes as our temperatures going down and turm it later in the day and in the evening are there any adjustments to that general theme that you to add or is a in anyway now i think that is exactly wa we recommend right now which is try to get at least thirty to forty minutes of exposure to some kind of natural daylight now there may be parts of the world were it is from youre from a a rather cloudy part of i am from ye a liverpool england a and a the north west of england is not known for its a beach results and fine weather a i remember i'd i went back home for trip when i'd first been outs ain california i thought why is the sky low it is just then o constantly a we joke that in an in the you ca we usually have nine months of bad weather and then three months of winter and that that is your that is you are entire year of intemts of a climate but to come to your point you are exactly right try to get that daylight now it can be working next to a window and you'l getting that natural sunlight but that natural sunlight is even on a cloudy day in england is usually far more potent than anything that you will get from indoor lighting despite you thinking from a perception wise maybe the that much closer than i would thing y i've been am start interrupt i've been n a big one of there is a an ap called light meter which well it is a free ap i've nothin to do with it they will allow you to aget a pretty decent measurement of the amount of a light energy coming toward you and if yo am hold it up to a cloudy morning where you do not think it is very bright outkind of a dismal day you' notice that they will be a thousand two thousand even he or five thousand looks locks just being a measure of brightness of course and then you can point the same ligkt meet retoward an indoor light that seems very bright and very intense and it will say five hundred lans and you realize that the intensity as we gauge it perceptionally is not really what thes system is receiving outdoor light est key how do you whow do you get this natural stimulation or am i should o say light stimulation early in the day what is your typical what is mat walker do ta this at's an anly i am no post e child but am usually i will an if i'm working i usualy work out most days am and i shopped around wand i found o jim that has huge amounts of window exposure facing to the east this is sound this can a sound at ridiculous that work it chouses a jim on the basis a lovit the sola imput he can wrot ther a lot or it tois is li in jims this one is rounded in physiology an biology and and selfishness about my own sleep us a soyo you get your exercise and your light stimulation sas rains ye ye and sor stacking cuse for wakefulness early in the exactly both exercise and daylight are wonderful cuese for secatin rhythm a linemeant an also secatian rhythm reset each day and i will use both exercise i mean i am i'm neither a strong morning type or astrong evening type and my preference to exercise is probably some time in the middle of the day i'm probably somewhere round one i one p msary not one am i'm but i'm usually working out probably around the said of seven said of forty five eight i a m time that is usully when i'll start my work out and there i start with cardio spend by facing a window and luckily for the most part here in california there is usually sunlight coming through but it does not matter to me becaust just as you cad even when it is a cloudy day that luck's coming through of light there the the intensity is is splendid i would prefer to favor mi exercise just because for efficiency too i one get also working on the day i'm i'll try to match mi exercise more with my cicadian light exposure than i weld probably if i'm going to do i really on a cressure work out or do i wanto just you kow makure it is a good work out i would prefer to work out at a different time but i that because of the daylight and we can speak about exercise timing at some point because there is a lot of discussion around that hen is the right exertime to exercise during sleep and we can said bustsom meths ther too i'm i think your spot on with the suggestion get some morning daylight try to get that exposure usually at least thirty to forty minutes there was some great work recently coming out in the occupational health domain where they moved workers from officies that were just facing walls and did not have any exposure to natural daylight and then they did a time period during that study where they actually were in front of a window and working and they measured their sleep and there sleep time and there sleep efficiency increase quite dramatically i'm forgetting the numbers now but i think the increase in total sleep time was well over thirty minutes and the improvement in sleep efficiency was five to ten per cent and if youre batting in eighty percend sleep efficiency average were a bit concerned about that but at tem per cent to that an now you are in great eshalon of healthy sleepers and all you did was just spend some time working in front of windows that is greaye and probaly folks my one i consider spending l last time as son glasses provided they can do that safefly you'n you are driving et cetera you are not alone with your exercise behaviour in facing e the one and only ten paris told me recently that his morning routine nowadays consists of jumping rope while facing east to get the sunlight stimulation of of the geyes and as a mat ni both no it has to be of the eyes ri on yo tes poritals a the only waydus to conveyd of the rest of the brain an body about the time of day and wakefulness along the lines of wakefulness a've anom ere questions about kaffine ye the dreaded and beloved kafinei love kaffi but i it in relatively a restricted periods of time i'm a big fan of waking up and even though i wake up very groggy allowing my natural wakefulness signals to take hold meaning i wake a very slowly but i do not drink kaffine right away ibserve delay kaffine while a little while usually ninety minutes to two hours and that idea came to me on the basis of my understanding of how kaffine in the a denisine receptor interact i've a feeling youre can pronounce a denisine differently than i do not no ill ao goi the inisi'l i'll try to go with your skiletal inser of skeletol an asa senaansin as set youon taat youl ner ya but but to make it really simple for voks how does kaffine work to make us feel more alert and does the timing in which we ingest kaffine play an important role in weather or not it works for us or against us may we just start with how does kaffine work why is it that when i drink mate or coffee which are my preferred sources of kaffine do i feel a mental and physical lift ye i'm going to suggest count to what most people would think drink coffee we will not is my taall yaer an whatever form you welling will will come on tos at o why i suggest that but when it comes to coffee i would say the dose and the timing makes the poison that start with how kaffine works i'm caffine is in a classof trokes that we call the psycho active stimulants it works through a variety of mechanisms i'm one is a dopamine mechanism dopen we we often think of as a reward chemical or im but dopamine is also very much in alerting you are a chemical as well kaffine has some role it seems to play in increasing dopemee but it is principal mode of action we believe in times of making me more al let and keeping me awake throughout the day is on the effects of a deniine and to explain what a denisine is from the moment that you and i woke up this morning this chemical a denisine has been building up in our brain and the longer that were awake the more of that a denisine accumulates is it may ask is it accumulating in nurons in glea or in the blood vessels where an end is it also accumulating in my body where is this a denisine coming from and wears it accumulatid yes the adenisine here that were talking about that is creating the sleep pressia is a central brain phenomenon and it comes from the nurons themselves combusting energy and as the combusting enegy one of the off shoo ts of that is this chemical a denisene ca and as we are awake throughout the day and our brain is metobolicaly very active it is accumulating in building up this a denisene now the the more adeniseene that we have the sleepia that we will feel it really is sleep pressure is what we call it thatit is not a mechenical pressure do not worry you head's not gano explain it is a chemical pressu and it is this waight of sleepiness that we feel gradually growing as we get into the evening may ama just ingi again to just ask a do we know what the circuit mechanism is for that i'm not to am go too far down the rabbit holl but for the evisnatos and for myself we have brain mechanisms locuseruliasire release things that er brain areas loxtril is just being a brain air of course that release things that creat that proactively create wakefulness ye are those nere on shutting down as the consequence of having too much a densine er are their areas of the brain that promote sleepiness that are and a activated because he is y imagine both things working in parallel ye on or the other would accomplish the same anpoint and it is it is both and there are two main receptors for a deniscene the a one recepta and the a to recepta and they have different modes of activating brain cells or inactivating or decreasing the likelihod of firing an a denisine works in this beautiful elegant way where it will inhibot and shut down the wake promoting areas of the brain whilst also increasing in diling up the volume on sleep activating sleep my almosting agrees ah it is always a pigical ye i man we and we could have a larger discussion at some point about that a everything seeing dark edges seeng light edges a yr ability to to smell or to sense pressure on this is everything's a push od's brat yaya this is another example where as i mawake longer a deniine is released in the brain an my wakefulness areas are being actively shut down by that a denisene and my sleepiness brain area to speak are being promoted to be more active is that correct that is right and it is a very progressive process it is not a step function wa and sometimes that happens occasionally but it is usually because you have beingstead of driving through and as will come on to have cafin in the system and then all of a certain you just hit a wool and it just engulfs you and you go from a zero to the one of sleepiness within a short pured time what itblains the fatigue after a hard conversation the desire to go to sleep or the desire to go to sleep during a hard conversation am that is an interesting ot i think it is usually just based on personality tivins directions and for the most part not a i've ever exerinsa no we with you do not but with me they ontin i te desireo to some conversations i'm half way through them and i feel o on a takan ap new right a and i would love to look at youknow people's sleep history we have sot of seen that time time again but i'm and then it could be been with with folks me people just lose the will to live within about five mna o speaking with mes not tathinoa sleep s inortan't in tat oi a nathing lattery that is great but the way that then kaffine comes into this i'm equation as o saying it is usually at the count of a linea process or maybe it is probaby closer to an expenantial interms of your subjective feeling of sleepiness i'm and we have not realdy been able to measure that in humans because normally we have its hard to at seep stick something into the brain and be sucking sifening offster for every couple of minutes as you could do in animal stidies and keep asking people avery coupe of minutes how sleepy doyou feel how sleepy and tractose if there is a line arise in a denysine which then creates and expenential rise in subjective sleepiness or what the dynamics are but i'm i'm can of nutting out kaffine comes into play here because kaffine comes into your system and it latches on to those welcome sights of a denysine the adenysine receptors but what it does not do is latch on to them and activate them because if it was doing that then it would in lots of ways it would dial up more sot of sleepiness it does the opposite the way that kaffne works is that it comes in competes with quite sharp elbows with a denasine competitively forces them out of the way ci jacks that receptor by laching on to it but then just essentially blocksit it does not inactivate te receptor it does not activate the receptor it functionally inactivates it in the sense that it takes it out of the game for a denasine it is it is some one coming into a room and you just about to sit down on the chair kaffin comes in and just pulls out the chair in you well now i've got nowhere to set and kaffin just keeps pulling out the chairs from a denasene and a denasene even though it is at the same concentration an your brain your brain does not know that you have been awake for kan hours sixteen hours at that point when you have down a cup of coffee because all of that a denasine that still there cont communicate to the brain that you have been awake for sixteen hours but just but the adenasine is still and brain trashit it is a the real question is what happens when kaffne is dislodged from the adenasnes unfortunate things happen and that is what we call the kaffine crash which is kaffine has a half life and its metabolized i'm and call what the halth life is ya the half life is somewhere between five to six hours and the quarter life there for is somewhere bet ing ten to twelve hours it is variable different people have different im durations of it is action but for the average dult five to six hours that variation we understand it is down to a liver en time or set of liveran times i'm off the class that we call the siht to crone peep fur fifty entimes and there arhe i think last ight i dealted into the dat to which is pretty recently there are too gene variance that will dictate the enzimatic speed with which the liva breakes down kaffine and that is why you can have some people who are very sensitive to kaffine and other people who say i'm just does not affect me ready that much a tweings that the people to have a doublestpresso after a nine p m dinner an yleep just fine well i'm we will come ilet objectively the tink soprejecatively ynd we we should speak about that that a sumptive danger too then the kaffine is in the system i'm and after some time period it will be inactive in the system lets say that you kow i've been awake for twelve hours now and it is eight p m and a feeling a bit tired but i want to pushed through when i want to keep working for another couple of hours i have a cup of coffei all of the sudden i was feeling tired but i do not feel i've been awake for twelve hours any more because with the kaffne in the system maybe only half of that a denisene is being communicated through the recepted to my brain hundred percent of the dthe adenisine is still that only half of it is allowed to communicate to my brain som now i think i have not been awake for twelve hours at just been awake for six hous feel great then after a few hours and the kaffine is stocting to come out of my system not's only am i hit with the same levels of a deniscene that i had before i'd had the cup of coffee several hours ago it is that plus all of the adenicin that is been building up juring the time that the kaffine has been in my system the sort of a an avalanche of it is sis an army way y and i've a kaffine crash and hit is interesting because the kaffine crash ad a two ofclock in the afternoon when you have workd to do is a terrible thing but what about the person maybe this personn as me in my cornins who says i'mnt a drink kaffine all day long and then i want the crash because at nine or ten p m if i stopp drinking kaffine at say six p m and i crash then i crash into a a slumber a deep night of sleep is that sleep really as deep as i think it is because given the half life of kaffne that you mention a few moments ago have to imagine that having some of that kafine circulating in my system might disrupt the depths of sleep were somehow the architecture of sleep and away that even if i get aigtor who knows even ten hours of sleep it might not be as restorative as i would it to be ym and that is the danger just at of that those people that you described who say and i well lot of them well i'm speep with me too say look i can have two espressers with dinner and i full asleep fine and i stay asleep because y usually those of the two fena types that we typically see with too much kaffin i just cannot full asleep as easily as i want to or i full asleep but just cannot stay asleep and kaffin can do both of those things quite potently how late in the day do you think is assuming somebody translite this voks if you go to bed or orly r or lator y afe ter shift e the hours accordingly but given a somebody who typically got gets in to bed around an and thirty and falls asleep round eleven eleven thirdy o when would you recommend the halt kaffin in tak and and these are not a strict prescriptirs but id think people dre benefit from having some a vairly clear guide lines of wy my might work for them would you say cut off kaffin by what time of the day i would usually say take your typical bedtime and counpt back sead of somewhere between ten to eight hours is probably getting a little bit close but take back instead of ten hours or eight hours of time that is the time when you should realy stop using kaffin is the suggestion and the reason is because for those people who even just keep drinking up until the into the evening you'r writ that they can full asleep fine may be they stay asleep but the depth of the deep sleep is not as deep any more and there are two consequence is the first is that for meat and it can be up to by thirty percend and for me to drop your deep sleep by thirty persent i'd have to age you by between ten to twelve years or you can just do it every night yourself wit the cople of aspressos the second is that you then wake up the next morning and you think while i did not have problems falling asleep and i did not have problem staying asleep but i do not feel particularly restored by my sleep now i'm reaching for three or four cups of coffee the next morning rather than just two or three cups of coffee and goes this dependency cycle that you then need your uppers to wake you up in the morning and then sometimes people will use alcohol in the evening to bring them down because their overly affanated an alcoholan we can speak about that too also has very diliterious impacts on your sleep as well you'r rite that it is not just the quantity of your sleep or even difficulties falling or staying asleep can also be deep sleep but here again i think i do not want to be frightening peeple and i mention this before i think one of the real problems that i or mistakes that i made cause i did not i'd never had much public exposure before the buck and and i was saddend by the disease and the suffering that i was seeing as a consequence of a lack of sleep in our society and the fact that it was not realdy being discussed very much i sord of came out a a little bit head strong more than a little bit headstrong and i think i was perhaps too too much gaspedal and too little break as it were and i do not think that is the right wa to approach health message within the public sphere and i've become much softra in how i think about these things i have ideas about what the ideal world looks for sleep but i also realize that none of us live in this thing called the ideal world we certainly s also i want to be really mindful of that and i think i've done a really bad job of being sort of patoo forthright particularly for people who struggle with sleep yu know ily on when i uld offer these sort of messages about sleep i want to be i want to be veritical when it comes to the science i want to be faithful to the science but i also do not want to go out and sca the living daylights out of people particularly people who are struggling with ther sleep cause it is probably only got to make masses was i've been busivfully schooled by i'm learning how to be a slightly best of public communicates i'm no anear of the sending that that you are you are very elegant and it is very intuitive to you i'm still with training wheels but i'm getting a little bit besta but i do not i just want to say that when i'm speaking about kafin cass it sounds as though i'm very i'm sot of ovat about it but i will come back to why i say drink coffee i'm but i just want to make that point no i appreciate you making that point and i'm sure our listeners will too i'm i still will i'm stand behind my state ment i'm which is that what you have done for the notion that sleep is vital for all aspects of health and for performance mental and physical and wakefulness the message an that and the packaging it was contained in and is has been clearly clearly net positive people needed to be cued to this not i'll sleep when i'm dead mentality is one that i had it is one that other people have i'm people in a huge number of vital communities not just your your students but also i'm people this the messageing that you provided and continue to provide has positively impacted the first respondor community the medical community there still steps that need to be taken the military community and of course the is civilian community and i think these adjustments about ye cafine's oka just restrict it to the early part of the day if you can most days i'm mant make the law f averages etly the light view in behavior i think it is critical to view sunlight or natural some other form of bright light early in the day but if you miss a day it is not that your whole system as gotings at iland to a puddle of tears tht do not that oll happen on the second or the third day not g biology works in averages exaccept with respect to accident or injury a car acit is a car accident right you do not get to have three of those before the brain damage occurs if the accedents severe enough but with sleep behavior of these i'm homeostatic type behaviors or with food one chocolate s onday is again to kill you no every night yet it is going to make you dimented and kill you early we know this and i think the the middle ground is off in a hard place to achieve i think you have done a phenomenal jowbut i appreciate you raising these points and and i think it is clear that we all need to that we all can and should do certain things better including being gentle with ourselves from time to time when we deviate from these a these ideal circumstances along these lines i i do want to talk about alcohol ecause i think kafin and alcol represent the on the con of two opposite ends of the spactrum clearly thereare other stimulants on there your ataralls and your a high energy drinks that people uses but alcal in kaffin are are the most commonly consumed a stimulants and anseditives te pressencees are sometimes call a what happens when somebody has a glass we always hear a glass or two of wine in the evening or er a a acocctail after dinner thewer before dinner how does that impact their sleep and then we will be sure to circle back in terms of what is reasonable ranges of behavior when it comes to avoiding alcohol or if it is age appropriate et cetera enjoying alcohol e alcohol if wer thinking about classes of drugs therein a class of drugs that we cull the sedatives and i think one of the fus problems that people often mistake alcohol is often used as a sleep aid for people who are struggling with sleep when things over thecounter remedies et cetero hav remedies have just not woked out for them an alcohln fortuney is anything but a sleep aid the first reason that most people use it is to try and help them full asleep soand this process of this event that we call falling asleep afe to imagine is a process it is aliting umbalgeer end that that process involves in some way as we talk about pushpole before turning off thinking planning ye et cetera and turning on some sort of relaxation mechanism i have to imagine that these two things are nopbs turning in opposite directions that jrains us this autcome we call fallin asleep alcall it seems is helpful for some people to turn off their fthoughts ar their planning is that right yes it is and i think yeif we look at the patern of brain activit if i were to place you inside and amariscana we ere looking at the activity of your brain and what you drifting off some pots if your brain will become less active other pots will become more active and this is the pushpull muddles inabition excitation but alcohol is quite different in that regard alcohol is because it is asedative whats it is ready doing is trankto sencialy knock out your quotex it is sedating your quotex an sedation is not sleep but when we have a couple of drinks in the evening when we have a couple of night caps we mistake sidation for sleep saying while i always when i have couple of whiskes or a couple of cock tails it always helps me full asleep faster in truth what is happening is that you'r losing consciousness quicker but you are not necessarily falling naturalistically asleep any quicker that is one of the first said of things just to keep in mind the second thing with alcohol is that it fragments your sleep and we spoke about the quality of your sleep being just as important as the quantity and alcohol through a variety of mechanisms at some of which are actofation of that autonomic nervous system that fight or flight brench of the nervous system alcohol will actually have you waking up many more times throughout the night your sleep is far less continuous now some of those awakenings will be of conctious recollection the next day you will just remember waking up many of them will not be and but yet you'r sleep will be litted with these st of punctured awakenings throughout the night and again when you wake up the next morning you do not feel restored by your sleep fragmented sleep or non continuous sleep in this alcohol in dused way is usually not good quality sleep that you feel great on the next day the the third part of alcohol intempts of an equation is that it is quite potent o blocking your rem sleep your rapid i movement sleep an remsleep is critical for a variety of cogntive functions am some aspects of learning in memory seems to be critical for aspects of emotional and mental health you have described it before as a sort of self generated therahby that occurs while we sleep yeit is overnight therahby it is emotional first aid it is otoinly you rether do not get enough sleep am or very easy to derail emotionally yeim not that one would want to do that to people but we all sort of fall apart emotionally are i i was ting that almost our skin sensitivity can be heightened yes when we are sleep deprived am are emotional sensitivity i is such that when we are sleep deprives a such that it takes a am much finer grain of sand paper to create that kind of friction yes bothers it threshold eten on i recomments bother us when we are sna and neer when wat wi a let to say that i never look at them except i look at an i shuld ver yeavy everybr i wel et it i realize because the notion of not looking at comments is m is unreasonable for to ask of any academic because academics we are all train to look at our teaching onvaluations and just with on line comments to ignore twenty person of them nim kidoan le them all an an inten in terms of translateness to behaviour i'm not i do not particularly enjoy alcohol i guess i'm might be fortune in that sense but i also have ne ver really experience that the pleasure of of drinking a alcall i sometimes the taste of of a drink but i never the sensation that is ha i do not have a lot of a familiarity with this but many people do and i understand that let us say somebody aenjoys a glass of wine or to with dinner and the dinner at seven p m is that likely to distrop their sleep at all what is just sort of let us make this a a series of gradations em and the ensis s yes em i think once ity just looked at a single glass of wine in the evening with dinner and i would be untruthful if i did not just simply say it has an effect and we can measure that in less yoim sleep less rem sleep and one of the fascinating studies i cannot remember what dose i think they got them close to astand e i'm illegal blood alcohol level maybe they were a little bit tip sleep and yes you see all of the changes that we just described im they sot of lose consciousness more quickly they have fragmented sleep and they have a significant reduction in rem sleep but what was also interesting because rem sleep as we spoke about before is a time when somehomonal systems are essentially recharged and refreshed growth hormon being one of them those well over a fifty per cent five zero drop in their growth hormone release during alcohol laced sleep at night a knothormon is vital for metabolism and repair of tiams and yo am 's not jusing body tat los esential tentials inessantial am along those lines i i just want a highlihe the fact that this this information theyure shoring that growth hormon is release is strongly tathered to the presence of healthy amounts of rem sleep is interesting to me because i always thought the growthormon was released in the early part of the nife well it is released i mim across both of those but cross the different stages but what we also know is that when you disr rem sleep the're are those growth homon consequens is it is not an exclusive a system just with testostrone we can see changes throughout nonrem sleep but if you ask when are the peak release rates off testostrone it is right before we go into rem sleep and then joring rem sleep and of course r testastron being importan both for for mals an amemals ri aver libido and tissue repairing well being that nobody regardless of cromosomo hormono or any other background wants to have their normal levels of testostron reduced acutely that is not a bad i i it acquites to a terrible set of psychological nd physical semptem ynd the mortality risk that is associated with lotestostrone is nontriili canswer right exactly coming back to just the point on rem sleep that you mentioned regarding emotional instability and we see that that is one of the things one of the most reli able signatures of just insufficient sleep does not have to be sleep deprovation what we have discovered over the past twenty years here at the sleeps center is that there is no major psychiatric disorder that we can find in which sleep is normal and i think that first slee told us there is a very intimate association between your emotional mental health and your sleep health but when it also comes to rem sleep i think what is fascinating is that it is not just about your emotional health it is not just about your hormonal health and we have also been seeing other aspects of ouno cognition but then there was a a report i think it couldhavebeen about two years ago out of harvard an i think it was beth a clearmance group a they found that and they replicated it in two different large populations if you look at the contribution of different sleep stages to your life span rem sleep was the strongest predinctor of your longjevity and it was a linea relationship but was not it sort of one of these you shape or jay shaped curves that we often see with total sleep and mortality risk it really was linea that the less and less rem sleep that you were getting the higher and higher your probability of death and then they did was that tath dyo do am natural causes s accidents i can imagine you would i gain of rem sleep you are more likely to drive off the free way stup offically i think it was all course maht a ad decisions about anything in love relationships ye i can also be life threaten ye i've tried to lean into that an claim that i am with those bad relationship situations thoh i just did not have enough and liken else li mi darling an evey sleep the earth and a but a is far wiser than than i thought but am theyve did this great machine learning analysis and i may get these numbers backwards but i think for every five per cent reduction in rem sleep there was a thirteen per cent as sociated increase risk of mortality ow and i could have i'll have to go back and and check but to me and in the machine learning algre them what they altimately spat out was that of all f the sleep stages rem sleep is the most predictive of your longjevity of your lifespan we often i hear people saying how can i get more deep sleep a or they sometimes say how can i get more dream sleep and my answer is a question why do you want to get more of that and i'll say what is not that the good stuff and i'll say well atch the all stages it is all the gosleep are yet wha's the exercise question and it took decades for people to understand that moving around at a for about a hundred and fifty probably a hundred and eighty minutes a week at doing endurance type work is own too cardio it is not type wore is is correlated with living longer feeling better last i bedis that is thar there is really no way around it and w you can am you can injest met foreman until the cows come home nd you can take in amen wall of which i think have have their place and am certain contacts ofm big fan of the work surrounding all all those protoclant wis but without getting proper amounts of movement meaning sufficient numbers oft does not matter how many twelve menute exercise regimes you follow for whit you need that threshold level and it sounds the same is true of remsleep and to and total amout ofsleep this is ye you am you pay the piper somehow yet he retunon investment i mean to to flit the coin the retun on investment is is astronomical yen i think of sleep its it is the tide that moves that raises oll of those helf boats and the most fundamental layer of mental and physical health whenever people ask me a even though ny physician they will ask me what what should i what h i take or what should i do the first question is always how is your sleep greening how well do you sleep every night and and how how long you see my always recommend your book i always recommend your pock i you the podcas you have been a aa guessed on et cetera am who knows may be leave in release your own pot castin because i do think people need to hear from you more often one thing i i do not on o return to the the notion of of a public health a discourse too much but i do want to say one issue with books in general is that they can be revised but it is more or less a one and done kind of thing and until the next book comes out ye one things i about the pod cast foremat is that updates can be provided regularly corrections and updates as new data come out and that is a a wonderful aspect to to this formad and and a hopfully the foremat that you will be ything i i hav worl needs to hear more from you more often about sleep in its various contours am not less and am i do have a question about a drinking alcohol ye not that we want to promote day drinking but let us say that the one or two glasses of ine or cocktail is consumed with lunch something that is not traditionally done nowadays or in a late afternoon happy hour tot cocktail and then one is going to sleep seven or eight hours later do you think that that will improve or somehow mitigate the effects of alcohol or if you have a drink are you are you basically screwed for the next twenty four hours no i think this going to be a a a time window dependent see now i do not know of any one whose escentially done what you and i would light which is the time separation dose dependent cave wer oca you drink at ten a m then or eeleven twelve one to three for five oll away up to youn o ten p m an estimate what is the blast radius an is it linia or is it non linia is it such that only when you drink in the last four hours d you just hit this exspenantial and it is bad bad bad or is the some other cuv that we can imagine there would be many possibilities but certainly what we know is that the lass alcohol and less and most specifically the metabolic by products altohides and keytones that the sort of the nepharious play is you not the eytones that people are all es i know about do no ther kthe other keytones yes they to may a cave us to know what were fornd yenbits is not about keysa genis this is not about keeter jens hes na heatone bodies and a that a released a after in jesting alcohol that are not of the positive sort direct that a a kito ganic diet might promote right now i think in terms of that alcohol a profile we certainly know that youas your heading into the evening hours once again timing in dose make the poison but i think it is also important once again from that public a message thampoy and thank you i think i i i am leaning into the t of the podcast a consideration arena at some point but i do not want to be puritanical here i'm just a scientist and i'm not here to tell any one how to live all i'm trying to do is impower people with some of the scientific literature regarding sleep and then you can make whatever informed choices that you want now inm you it turns out i'm not to big drinkaads just because i've never liked the taste and i'm surprise that they have not taken away my british passport because i do not loger or o bea am but i also want to say that life is to be lived to a certain degree it is all about checks some balanceis if i go out and i have an ice cream sunday i'm not big on those either but now sure i know that my blood glucos is not going to be ideal for another twelve hours maybe that is just the price you pay for having some kind of relaxed fun life i do not want to look back on life and think gush i lived until i was a hundred and elevean and it was utterly miserable right but it is all about some kind of a balance an mine my job is not to to tell people a'm a prescription for life it is just to offer some scientific information i think you are doing a terrific job of that people are i wu say we have all these nerl circuits and am if it is working properly we all have a circuit that allows us to u skip over information or as we wish right if the circuits between your brain and your thumbs are working you can slide right along you can drop to the next a content how ver you i i would to ask about marowana and seebidi theres a discussion that i think five years ago would have ventured into the realm of e legal but now yer in many places not all medical marouana is approved or is legal and certainly it is in widespread use certainly not recommending people do it i ha my own thoughts about a marowana c b i've been fortunate i suppose that i do not particularly marowana or c b d i do not even know i've ever tried c b d am first of all does marowana disrupt the depth of sleep the architecture of sleep on and if a as with alcon kaffin does when you a in jestit or when it is in your blood stream does relative to when you go to sleep does that min an important ralso does marowana disrupt sleep ye it it does and there is a pretty good amount of data on we can break a to cannabist down in co two of its k ingredients we have got t h c tetra hydro conabanal and we have got c b d and c b d is sot of the the less pcyclat's it what we think of as the non pcsycho active component in other words when you take c b d you do not get high if you take t h c you can get high that is the pcycho active part of the equation are both considered sadits an the technicles a now then not a neither of them have that class right now t h c can seems to speed up the time with which you fall asleep but again if you look at the the electrical brain wave signature of your falling asleep with em without that t h c it is not conto be an ideal fit you could argue it is non natural but many people use t h c fl that fact because they find it difficult to fall asleep and it can sped the onset of at least non consciousness i guess the best way of describing it but there are problems with t h c and there are twofolt the first is that it two but through different mechanisms seems to block rem sleep and that is why a lot of people when they using will tell me i i definitely i was dreaming i do not remember many of my dreams and then when they stop using a t h c the say i was having you knon't just crazy crazy dreams and the reason is because there is a rebound mechanism rem sleep is very clever and alcohol is the same way in this sense its the same homyestatic mechanism some people will tell me look if i have bit of a wild friday night with some alcohol it maybe i'll sleep late into the next morning and i'll just have thes really intense dreams and i thought i was not having any rem sleep wat the way it works is that it is during in the middle of the night really and whend alcohol blocks your rem sleep and your brain is smart it understands how much rem sleep you should have had how much rem sleep you have not because the alcohols been in the systm and finally in those early morning hours when youregetting through sysmm cix zavin t an all of a certain your brain not only goes back to having the same amount of rem it would have had it does that plu s it tries to get back all of the rem sleep that it is lost does it get back all of the rem sleep know it does not it never gets back ol of the rem sleep but it tries and you have these really intense periods of rem sleep hance yu have riddy intense beza dreams and that is what happens also with t h see you build up this pressia for rem sleep this dat for rem sleep will you ever pay it back does not seem as though you get back everything that you lost but will you get back some of it yes the brain will stort to devour more because it is being starved of rem sleep for long but one of the biker problems with t h c that we worry about it s with druel dependent c as you stouht to use t h c for sleep that can b a a dependenc tolerance you stop to need more to get the same sleep benefit and when you stop using you usually get a very cevere rebound in somnea and in fact it is potent that it is typically pot of the clinical im with drel profile from t h c from canabus oes' there is anxiety withdraw i i am i i do not i ask anybody to change their behaviour we just as you said we try and inform people by what the science as and and let them make choices for themselves people were regular apot smokers if you that many of will insist there not addicted and and mmaybe indeed they do not actually follow the profile of classical addiction i do not know i'm gessing some du some do not but am if you ask them well what if i took away all marowana consumption for a two weeks that thought scares many of them and many of them will experience intense anxiety without marauana which speaks to perhaps not addiction but a certain kind of dependency am and again i i been i know many pot smokers am some of whom i have jobs that are that are quite high performing and they and they manage here in bonly i do not know any of an kno knot am t the what about c b d i may we here much about c b doi've been a little concerned about the fact that am the analysis of a lot of c b d supplements out there is confirmed thet much with meletone and the levels that are reported on the labels in no way shap perform match the levels that are actually contained in the various supplements sometimes that the levels are much higher than they are reported on the labels other times it is much lower am what is in jesting c b d du to the architecture and quality of sleep right now i do not think we have enough de to make some kind of meaningful sense out of it i think the picture that is a mudging however is probably the following firstly c b d does not seem to b det trementful in the same ways that t h c is we can stop by saying it does it create create potential problems not of the the nature necessarily that we see with t h see but the devil is a little bit in the details from the data that we do havein it comes on to you a valid point of purity at lo dose c b d can seem to be wake promoting me in lowedosis that say sot of five or ten melegrams an trenc to remember some of the studies of took my head there it actually may in handswakefulness and cause problems with slep it is only once you get into the hiher dose range that there seem to have been some you kow increase is at stray increases in sleepiness or set of sedation liken am increases and that is usually i think above about twenty five meligrams as best i can recall from the data and then when we luk in animal models you typically se the same type of profile too then the question becomes and now again you just do not know about purit it is svery difficult although i think and again i i not o usid not necesrity because i have anything against it it is just that is not you kow nesarity my cup of t there are some fims that are now doing third party independent laboratory tests i do not know how gamed that is i've got no i think i some i supplement companies are quite a honest and accurate about the mounts of very substances that are in other a products and some ere not yo and i think there is just a huge range i think yeu after a is starting to explore sb d there i certainly i saw some grant announcements to explore youre function sb most of the work on sb d is being done by the general poblic in justing it and how they feel i leave it to my dog who was had some a dementure related sleep disturbances and it actually et created a heighten wakefulness at completely sotly up his is sounds as tonles otis all dogs ot hes gon and get access to sleepies gan a take et o gam really massed him up took took it away he did better am but that is at that is a kenine ragt i could have been tat of dose related too but minders or other things that are in ther shurect e and we but but right now if we were to and i'm not making the statement i do not think any one could make the statement now but if it ends up being that c b d is potentually beneficial for sleep how can we reconcile hat mechanistically and i think there are to me at least there are at least three candidate mechanisms that i've been exploring and thinking about the first is that it is themoregulatory and what we found in some animal models is that c b d and we will create a profile of high po thermia in other words it cools the body the calbody temperature down and tht something that we know is good for sleep the second is that it is an anxiolitic that it can reduce anxiety and that dater is actually quite strong even with some functional imaging work that is been coming out recently showing that one ep centere of emotion will be a maktula deep within the brain is quietan down with c b d i think that at least a seconds and on mutethat is erate that is indusive in a possibility i think the third am is some recent dates that is come out that was suggesting that c b d can alter the signalling of a denacene it does not necessarily mean that you produce more a denicene but what it can do is perhaps modulate the sensitivity perhaps of the brain that the weigt of that same a denacene is weigtia in its brain signal and therefore it creates this strong oppressiue for sleep i think these are ol tentative mechanisms i think any one of them is fiable i think oll three are fiable together but right now i think does that sert of help think through the the tapestry of t h c and c b d a very much and actuallates a it is a perfect saguay from we have talked about kafin alcohol t h c and c b d as sort of a wee framed them anyway as things that done in moderation at the appropriate times are probably oke for most people certainly not for everybody there will be difference as in sensitivity but that done at the incorrect times and certainly in the incorrect aamounts will greatly disrup this vital stage of life we call sleep c b d it seems represents a kind of bridge to the topic i'd to talk about next which is things that promote more healthy sleep or somehow contribute to enhancing the architecture and quality of sleep i'd love to chap or moment about the kind of grant the original i should say that not the grandady but the o g of sleep socclementation which is melatona here the called hornmone of darkness a that is inhibited by light et cetera frame for us melatonan in the contects of its naturally occurring form and then i'd to talk about melatonean the supplement because as in my experience any time i say the word melatonan people thing about the supplement melatonand which ar in itself is an interesting am a phenomenon that people are cue to its roll as something you take we often forget that this is something that we make in dogenously i'd love for you to commen in particular on even though we without nesserly getting intos precise nanagrams prodests ta leader values what are the typical amounts of melatonean that we release each night and then i'd to compare that to what is contained ind say a three melegramor six melegram tablet that one might buy at the pharmacy rat itso i go to sleep at night has melatonan already kicked in before i shut my eyes and lay down my head usually yes if your system is working in the correct wain as dusk is storting to happen let us say that you look at huntogather a tribes who on touch by electricity and that is it of the puritenical sta par excellance when it comes to electric a light influence am and usually it is as dusk as approaching thats when melatone an well start to rise and when you lose the break pedale of light coming through the ise that normally acts ahard break pedal that stamps down and prevents the release and production of of melatonean as that ligt break pedal stats to fade with dusk thand we ease off the break pedal and melatone in the spicket of melaltem melatone an is opened up a melatone instarts getting released and usually will see this rising peak of melatonean am some time you salle an hour two hours later or round and it varies from different people around the time of sleep itself but it is already been on the marge for some hours before you attually hit sleep itself interesting and up i was always taught and i'm assuming it is still true that the only source of maletoneand in the brain em body is the pineeo glan is that still true iye it seems to be from best that we can tell and the pineolgland am sort of meaning pelike bsert of a shape attatually i think ou sey people say its pelike i think if you look at the latin terifitive it is more am i think it is derive from pine cone not pe because in fact if you look at the penila it is more pine cone japed ancers aptly named anly human brain i've ever dissected woi confess a das a telack as i teachng oronatomy and have for years am i i love looking at the pieol it is the one structure in the brain that is not on both sides is usually pretty usy to fined and it is pretty good size at it looks a it looks a pe and it is sitting right there and it is remarkable that it releases this hormone as certait probably our entire life span and is inhibited by light the a pineal starts to release this into the general circulation after imagine we of meleatone a receptors in the brain embody correct ye essentiually your brain has a central master twenty four hour 'clock called the superciasmatic neu cleus that peeps internal time now it is not a precise clock if left to its one devices nothing that a swiss clock maker would be proud of it runs a little bit long and laggy an american clock o ot american watches by the way a antans ar verin r is but not fame as for our time keeping or our punctuality for thaem ar but the swiss are it is very it it is it is not quite swiss it is more burcled which is very relaxed o what ave and in most adults if the average it olt i should say your biological clock normally runs a little bit long it is a bows am about twenty four hours and thirteen minutes i think was the last calculation but the reason that we do not keep drifting forward in time and cond of running consistently e more and later and later thirty minutes by thirty minutes by thirty minutes each day is because your central brain clock it is regulated by external thing such as daylight and temperature as well as food and activity all of these are essentially different fingers that come along and on the rist watch of the twenty four clock will pull the dial out and reset it each day to precisely twenty four hours and i make that point because it knows twenty four hour time but it needs to tell the rest of the brain and the body the twenty four hour time as well and one of the ways that it does this is by communicating a chemical signal of twenty four hour nurse of light and day using this hormone melatonin and when it is at low levels or its non existent it is communicating the message it is daytime and for us dianal species it says it is time to be awake yet at night time when dusk approaches and the break comes off melatonan and we stot to release it then it is signals to the rest of the brain and the body look it is dusk and it is night time and for us dinal species it is time to think about sleep melatonin essentially tells the brain in the body when it is day and when it is night and with that when it is time to sleep when it is time to wake and therefore that is why melatonan helps with the timing of the onset of sleep but it does not really help with the generation of sleep itself and this is why well come on to what those studies of supplementation have taught us i tells the rest of my brain and body it is time to go to sleep an it perhaps even aids with the transition to sleep but it is not going to for incit is insure the or all structure of sleep or a it is not the conductor that is guiding the sleep orcastar to speek throughout the entironite ya it is e more the thethe people that as emcally take you to your seet and sit you down and give you your programme ra exactly yes it vthe far and less sophisticated analogy i have is are yor melatone is the starting official at the hundred meter race in the olympic not a better and it cor calls all of the the sleep races to the line and it begins the great sleep race a better is nolege i eoia an as ta an an tretera monae a but it does not participate in the race itself that is a whole different set of brain chemicals and brain and brain regions which then brings us on to perhaps the question of supplementation which is is it helpful for my sleep will i sleep longer will i sleep better and if i am what doses should i be taking sadly the evidence in healthyp adults who are not older age suggest that melatonan is not really particularly helpful as a sleep ad i think here is a recent meteranalysis that demonstrated when i'm it it looked at all of the different sleep per ametis melatonan cram anmeteranalysis for these not knowing what that is it is a scientific sot of metho that we use where we gather all the individual stidies and we put them in a big bucket and we can av do this can a statistical fancy slight of hand and we trid to come up with a big picture of what all of thes individuals thadies tell us and what that metronalysis told us is that melatonan will only increase total amount of sleep by three point nine minutes on average minutes menit at is per cent not an it will only increase your sleep efficient seep by two point two per cent it ridis as as a they say in certain bards of californs it is weak sauce amaninas asome it the source is not strong the fulse is not strong in in in this wont when it comes to hat a tool that in healthy people who are not of older age it does not seem to be especially beneficial now results can vary every one is diffent of course wit talking about the average the socald average human adult here well melatonan am in defense of what you are saying and also i should mention i have a collygu et stampford a jimy's itesir o onceful just t ices la but harbard med wer also trained and trific sleep researchure and asked him about meletonan an ussentially said the same thing that you just said which is very little if any evidence that it can improve sleep and yet it is probably the most i'm commonly consumed called sleep it hundreds of menon dollars industry yes it either massive plecisibo o fact or its operating through some other mechanism related to quelling anxiety broas it ya that is is achally interesting there are some sidies where you do see some effects now again when you do the grand average of ulse thadies it just does not seem to have an effect but lat's asseume that for some people it does have an effect that is not again beatst of completely dismissive ef that how could it have that effect one of the reasons that i've become a little bit more bullish on melatonein from a sleep perspective and the melatonein more generally for a i mab be can speak about this to as a counter measure unwhen you are under going in sufficient sleep im there are too all to different roots that the first reason that i think it could have a sleep benefit for some people is not because it helps in the generation of sleep we know that it does not it is because it too seems to drop cor body temperature there it is not againd im i'm fascining these days more and more by temperature as am it be not just a rea reflection of brain state and wakefulness and in sleep but actually a lever that as quite powerful and it is and and with all the interest ind ice bas and hotchours and sanas anself something that we will deafullin touch on am temperature veriation is key if if melatonan is dropping body temperature by a degree or something that you have said be or can help induce a sleepy state ah maybe that is what is alowin people to getting that is oncs loss oility i i do not think meletone by itself will drop it by itst of at a degree senthingin our degree selsius and for ordin in us to fool asleep and then stay asleep across the night we do need to drop orcorbody temperature buy about one degree selsius or about two to three degrees a farnheight and that is why it is always easier to full asleep in a room that is too cold than too hot am i think that that is one potential avenu that we are considering thinking more deeply about when it comes to melatonian and then the other is melatonan as an antioxiden but let us i let me table that for now cause i'll just get a sidetract that is what we know far about melaton in in times of it is supplementation benefit or lack thereof two final points that i should not forget one is the only population where we typically see some benefit and it often is prescribed is in old redults because alder meaning a sixty in all this yes sixty sixty five and older because as we get older you contypically have what is called calcification of the penial gland which means that that gland that is releasing meletonian does not work as well any more as a consequence they tend to have a flatter over all cave of melatonian release throughout the night it is not this beautiful lovely peak and this bull hon message of it is darkness please get to sleep that is why oldredults can have problems folling asleep or staying sleep it is not the only reason by sur any stretch of the imagination but it is one of the reasons in it is why meletone and supplementation in those cohorts old redults especially old redults within somnia people have thought about that as maybe in appropriate use case well on those lines and if we were to compare dosages a i do not do we know how much meletonian its typically released into the blood stream per night am an can we use that as a kind of a rule of thumb by which to compare of the typical amount that someone would supplement i bigly the supplements for meletone an that i see a in the farmersee and elsewhere and on line range anywhere from one melegram to twelve or even twenty melegram ya my gues is that a normal nights release of meletoneand typical for somebody in ther twentyes thirdiys for itiys would be far lower than that an i's corrector wrong ye it is it is a many magnitudes lower and this is one of the problems is that i see that to i see you now typical dose is ar five melegrams or ten melegrams and of course if you are a supplement company putting ten melegrams vus is five melegrams if that is what you are atually doing which we will speak about purity as well an you it is canoph the super gulp size nobody wants to lower price they just want you to we will just give you more for the same price and that is how we will compete it is been this escalating aums race of meletone and concentration and it really does not look meaning ful for youn't forsleep in anyway what we vatually found is that the optimal dose is for whay you do get sleep benefits in the populations that we have looked at a somewer between zero point one and zero point three melegrams of meletona in other wrds the typical dose is a youse the ten times twenty times may be more then what your body would naturally expect and this is what we call a supera physiological dose in other words it is far above what is physiologically normal you nownt but theny contix imagine i said to you i want you to eat twenty times as much food to day othough you can use testostronas example iu no let us you are ging to take three hundred times the normol amount ed to such or we know that would have a tons of dilaterious offacts very terrible and yet you can do this what one thing that i'm concerned about about these superphysiological levels of melatone and is that a many years ago ashald here berkly when i was a graduate soon we would inject animals which were seasonably breeding animals with melatonan and the consequence of that was that there a gonads either their testes or overis would shrink many hundred hundredfold or more a in other words that they would go from having am nice healthy sized hampser ttesticls what a hampster would consider healthy size am for hampster and they would shrink to the size of a grin of rice from an almonds to a grain size of a grain of rice i had to see that only once for me to be very concerned aout superphysiological levels of melatonand and i realize that nelatonean does different things indifferent species we are not hampsters we are not seasonal breeders how seasonly restricted breeders there might be more breeding gurin certain seasons i doft kow those data but none the less hormones are powerful and and sure there is an optimol and sometimes a we see that going slightly above in doginous levels for certain hormones not always can have beneficial effacts and sometimes it can have detrimental effacts i'm just concerned about taking high levels of a hormone that has a facts on the reprodoctive axus and that is one other reasons why i get very concerned when i see people really getting aggressive about melatonan supplementation taking a hundred ten five hundred sometimes even ten thousand times the amount that we would normaly release that is that is my concern although it is not nested in any one specific human study i ju i just do not to see i certainly do not want to see other people and i do not want it a personally take a hormone that is known to be androgen suppressive at high levels why would i why would i take that i a that imation i asked myself i think it is a very good point and if you look at some of the evidence around meletonans le thality if you want to go to that extreme for the most part it it is pretty safe the you mean the otyou can take a lot of it before you die right exa yebthat is that is a no toe ouw e outotay because yuknow you realneed to think about your your health not just whether the surn is going to to kill you or not as the decision mate tricks through which you porit a pupapill and it comes on to this concern around meletonia because therewas a study i think it is one that you mention too whe they looked at over i think it was at least of a twenty different brands of meletone and supplements and what they found is that based on what it sad on the buttle fus is what was in the the captuals themselves it ranged from i think it was eighty tree percent last than what it said on the buttle to four hundred and seventy eight per cent more than what it said on the buttle now if you if that is a ten milogram hill and it is for hundred and seventy eight per cent more than ten milograms and wil already at ten milograms at many tens of times more than is a physiological rather than a super physiological dose i do need to be a bit thoughtful ye remember those hamsters a well an i do appreciate the deep dive on meletoneum because i think people need to understand that it is it is new ants it is a matter of dosages in timing et cetera and then it may have its place as you mention in in all their individuals yem and i should mention that i'm an avid consumer of supplements that i believe in for me and i have been for a very long times i'm by no means anti supplement on some supplements i refuse to take or avoid taking others i'm a quite avidly take and om along those lines i personally a and i do not know a what your thoughts on this or but aw there a few things that i've personally found beneficial love your thoughts on them and i would love it if you would tell me that a everything i'm about to refer to is placebo that would be fine a that is what we do were scientists we argue and then and then we on we remain friends in a as as a go im magnesium there are many forms of magnesiou magnesium citrate is a as we know as a terrific lacative a magnesium malade seems at least from a few studies seems to relieve some of delayed on set muscle sorinests does not seem to create a kond of sedation two forms of magnesium that i'm aware of magnesium by glicenate an magnesium three inate ye we believe based on the data can more actively cross the bludbring barrier you putin your got but some of that mesi on your brain no would have the sed of effect what are your thoughts on magnesium supplementation do you supplement with magnesium and om what what studies would you to see done if they have not been done already i do not supplement with magnesium a but i do think three and eight is interestink because of that hire capacity to cross the blood brainbarrier and agually have a central nervous system effect and the reason that that interests me is because the sleep is by the brain of the brain and also for the brain as well as for the body we just do not have a particularly good set of studes that of targeted exclusively three and eight we do have lots of studies that of just looked at magnesium in general for sleep and over all the data is uncompelling interust and for a while i i was confuseus to why where did this come from this can of myth of magnesium i started looking back into the literature and i've best traced it at least as far as i can tell to early study showing that those who were deficient in magnesium also had sleep problems they had other problems too of course but sleep problems were one of that set of siquali that came from having lower magnesium and when they supplemented with magnesium and trid to restore those levels some of those sleep problems dissipated and then that seems to have got lost in sand of some game of whispers around the room and it is become translated into people who do not have sleep problems who are healthy sleepers and who are healthy in general and you have healthy normal levels of magnsium if they take more magnesium they will sleep better and the data really there it is not a good once again the only study that i've seem where magnesium did have some efficace was in a study with old redults i think they were sixty to eity is old it may have been exclusively women now i think about it and they also had insomnia and in that population you did see some benefits and my guess is that because it is an older community is well they were probably probably deficient in magnesium they fit the former cat agree of simply when your deficient and you restore you can help sleep soid return to normal but if you are not deficient and youre healthy ing you not olding you do not have in somnia and your supplementing thinking that it provide sleep right now the data is not supportive ef that but i just do not think we have an authree and ete data to actually speak about that because it could just be a blood brain barrier issue far with the other forms maybes some additional studies looking speciliaaly at three in ator by glycenate would be would medleste magnesiums involvedan many seller processes you can imagine that this a fact if it truly exist is as we say insines in the noise meaning it is in the it is in the the gidder of the data but to isolate the real effact one needs to do some more refined studies am what are some things that are of the interest to you if not things that you happen to take am i these are not thingsthat i personally take most because i'e just have nan experimented with them a volarian root ah is one am tart cherry and keewy fruit tell me about tell me about valarian rout tart cherry and keewe fruit this is new to me am a have certainly heard of them and am tartcherryand keewe sons delicious abut what what is happening with valarian rout tart cherry and keewe and are we talking about eating tart cherries and keewees and valarian rout e why yet i not taking them in billfor usually it supplements but it is also both for tart cherries and for keewees ins the atual you knont fruit themselves valarian often touted as a beneficial sleep aid and lots of people swar by it to but the evidence is at see quite agains thou really not that it makes your sleep worse but of at least the seven good studies that i've been able to find and typically these are of the nature of what we call a randomie pleseebo crossover desine and i will not boll people with what that means it is st of won of study solid yis one of the sert of gold standid methods that we have wen were looking at int to ventions thaty such as struks tities five of the seven found no benefit aof valarian rout on sleep then too out of the seven the data was just insufficient i think it was a power issue where they just could not make any strong conclusions and then i think there was the most recent am study i think looked at too different doses of valarian i could have this wrong and they just fail to find any effects once again but the stoning part of that paper as i recall they have this big table with all f the different sleep matricts that they looked at and they were well over twenty five different things that they tried to see if valarian impact it and none of them were significant which stuns me because from statistical probabilities we know if you just randomly perform twenty five statistical tests chances are probablistically you will just get wand signifficant result by random chance and even with random chans on their side they still could not find a benefit of a a valarian valarian rout might be worse than nothing at al if there is a to speak ae again plecero effect we ont we can think about that two and i would say that if you feel as though it is having a benefit for you and with all the caviats that we have with supplements thinks meletone an purity concentration et cetera maybe it is no harm no foul but i'm not a a a medical doctorana i do not tell any one about we have all o these disclaimis about not reckoan well include these g then ow we say were not physicians we do not prescribe anything were signed to some professors we profess things ot it a pobl to be responsible for their own health am to not just to protect us but to protect themselves am i do on it here about tart cherry yawe fruit am what what is the stories ar trange as n it i was i i'm can of a hard no scientist and when people some years at goes tut at saying ow tart cherries its thing or keywee fruits i was thinking i gan this the sounds a been californs an o to ou ye i know ha the sun has suftened me as tem but i thought the one of the things that we have to do as scientists is be as open minded as possible and i should not be quick to dismiss i when to the literjust just started reading as much as i could about it and there were three really good randomise plesee bo cross over trials with tart cherries and what they found was that in one study it rejuiced the amount of time that you spent awake at night by over an hour and then the other two studies one of them found that it increased the amount of sleep that you got by thirty four minutes the other it increase the amount of sleep that you got by eighty four minutes are which these are and what striking is that they were independent at studies ither think meaning that they were from independent groups and these were some of these guis youn i in gells i know pretty well an really know in trust there were right i really trust ther were toly in justing actual tartcherries of the drinking the juice or in capsal it was juce they in all three studies it was juice and although you can i think as a supplement you can buy it in a capsue hn we have got no idea whether that changeus the benefit or not what was also interesting in i think it was that last tudy where they got in increase in sleep by eighty four minutes it also decreased daytime napping significant and that is one that i could certainly make useu lato i i love you sit of tow you knows but i thusly skiped them to right and and we can speak about naps and such a the upside and downside of that which then made me think well if that is the case may be the net net benefit on sleep over all is no different it is just that it decreases the amount of time that some people were taking to sleep during the day and giving it back to the night but that was not the case as if you added the total amount of sleep that they were getting without tart cherries both naps and nightly sleep combined still when you took tart cherries you still got a net some benefit nontrocitial amount of sleep far when it comes to supplements and those types of studies the good studies and the data looks interesting but as a drug itself if this was clinical drug uknow three studies that are somewhat small in nature and have some positive benefit that is what we would call preliminary data of maybe a chin scratching kind yand is genn on the margians for safety one might think well given then it is a tart cherry as u pus to some former suitable union prescription for than and some people their thrushold to experiment was supplements is quite low some people their threshold is quite i i feel the're two categories or at least two categories of folks out there people who here o tartcherry can improve sleep and will run out and try it and people who heare well thats sounds crazy why would i do that am but of course we have to remind people that tartcherry is not really what were talking about presumably if this is a real affact and sounds it might be that there is a compound in tart cherry insry that if we were to call it whatever whateer five alphis ix some molecule if we referred to it by ts technical name then people say o that sounds a very interesting technical way to approach sleep but does not sound very natural both grips or little bit am misguided i in acense that people think that everything that comes from naturally occurring foods plants it set oro things that grw of the ground that that is all safe that is not true and people that think that forma sutacles are the on if it is not evidence with the purified molecule than something is not of utility witl that is certainly not true somewhere in the middle i think lies the answer which is sounds to me tartcherries at least an intriguing potential sleep at intriguing potential sleep ad and i'm under scoring potentia am i'v certainly intrigue by it to the point where i i might experiment a bit but i'm an experimentor for myself am before i a ask you about keewe i've had quite good results from taking something alled apigenan which is a derivative of camomile but in supplement form i thing i take fifty melegrams about thirty minutes before sleep and i subjectively experience a i better night sleep is beau i do not measure i ha confess i do not measure my sleep i'm not a sleep tract any i am but i you kow there a few papers out there they are not what we wild call blue publishd in blue ribbon journals but they have control groups and in it look somewhat interesting and the're when i say apogenan a people get somewhat intrigtale with a molecue cemomile has long been fhought to be a setative a mild setitive but a sedative a you drink camomile te do you take apigenan an what your thoughts on apoguv yet i i do not and i i have looked into some of the days a regarding sleep as well right now from best i can tell it is it is mostly subjective tats ar of than objective had sait of sleep metshes and that is whi right now i i sit of unclea not no comment but just an clea not dismissing it because i think you and i both ascri to the idea of absence of evidence is not evidence of absence keep your mind open at least i tellit to myself a i think if you will finding a benefit and you can do what i would think of if i was personly experimenting whichis both the positive and negative pots of the experiment what i mean by that is u let us say that i now want to you think about some kind of a sleep supplement i will take some kind of base lind set of recordings for month and iill just gauge where i'mat set of supplement free then i'll go on for a month to whatever i'm thinking of of taking an i do not supplement but let us say that i want to and i experiment with that an i feel as though based on my metrics be them objective from my or a ring will be them subjective from whatever i'm riting down in the morning and both are important valid subjective an objective we both in the sleep world and i think oca look it is clearly that the it seems to have some kind of an effect the key thing however is then do the negative experiment which is now come off it for another month and see to things get worse and if i can see that by directionality then i'm starting to think maybe i'm believing this a little bit more that is the way i would of typically approach a supplementation regiment if i were to do it and that is just me that is just the way my mind works but no that is great iththing it is very very scientific and organized in a way that alows are you and and would allow other people to make very inform decision for themselves am i that i nom i to think in terms of of manipulating any aspect of arbiology that behavioural tools always are the first line of entry then nutrition everyone as the sooner or later even if you'r fasting then perhaps supplementation then prescription drugs and then perhaps brain machine in her face devices that use o induce something and those can be done in commination but what concerns me is when i hear people i say what what should i take without thinging about their behaviour their light viewing behavior et cetera but of course these things work in commination an i think it is you right that the is many when it comes to sleep there are many low hanging fruits that do not necessarily require you to put sat of exoginius molecules in other waye things supplements into your body or use different types of drugs to help you get the now when it comes to prescription sleep ades i think i've been again a little bit to forthright we knowing clenical practice that the maybe a time an a place for things sleeping pills they are a short time solution to certain forms of insomnia but they are not recommended for the long time and we also know that there are lots of other ways that you can get a sleep i'm help or youcan get asleep curative profile from things cognative behavral therape for insomene which is a non drug approach a psychel and quite effective from one i very just as goodvo sleeping pills great data more effective in the long time therese a recents that he published that after working with that therapist some of the benefist lasted almost daccade now if you stop sleeping pills usually you have rebound in sommnia way of sleep goes back to being just ast bad if not wer s and i think the same is true when we think about supplementation there are many things that are easy to implement when it comes to sleep that do not require venturing out into those waters and again we are not here to tell any one about whether they should venture or not that is completely your choice whal i'm saying is that if you one to think about optimizing your sleep there are a number of ways that you can do it that do not necessarily require you to swallow anything or inject anything or you now smoke anything or o yowace the margins of savety are quite quite why right that is that is the other one yesri just be o lowhanging fruit a oror howa hangs reality but what what about kywe they are delicious to me anyway ya the humble key we fruit a name not a should not be mistaken for the the the am flightless bud of a you zealand which is the native bid that were tooking about the key we the fruitere which a those trees and shrubs are a mostly a south east asia key we fruits have beeng previously toutid as potentially having asleep benefit which again got me curious anight at first threug it out to my knowledge this ready only one published humans thaty that is of any value but what they did find was that it decreased the speed of time with which it took you to fall asleep thes ae rea injusting the howkewe it is injesting the whole cleep le skin i yes gin pee the scringe when they see me well i o the only there is no no no i think the idea is some of the good stuff and out come on to this may actually be in the skinninself thank you you as you you are just what you just help me when of that i'll give you o ka oka a pamulat by the way this skin is use an then a o jus to tas i that is ar ewents no he did not a the skin seems to be part off this potential sleep equation and that is thaty yet the am you fell asleep faster and you stayd to sleep for longer and you spent less time awake throughout the night and i just thouht wele that is once thady what can earealy do with that there is another stady however in an animal model which is a little bit more interesting and once again they found a very similar fena type that the rats i say they were mice the mice fell asleep faster and they also spent longer time in sleep the sleep juration also increase what was also interesting mechanistically and this is not the mechanism that i think tie togethe tart cherries key we frut t and you nothinks melatonan cause i think there could be one common binding a mechanism what they found in the animal stuady is that they could block those key we fruit sleep benefits using a gabba blocking agent now gabba a gabba at which is stands for gamma amenio buteric acid here is one of the major inhibotory your a transmitters of the brain it is cannot lake a ga alicering saiditive i a sort of gets it account of the red light on the traffic light signal im others are green light im gabber is red light by playing around with some sort of clever drugs tomaniculate the system they could prevent the benefit of the key we fruit by sit of buggering araun with the gabba receptav meaning that perhaps part of the key we fruit benefit on sleep was mediated by the brains natural inhibotry your transmits a system caled the gaba sust ipside and i thought that thit was that was kand of that convince me a little bemore that maybe the something here to read into to be determined again here is the bana but taught cherries and keywe fruits the daysa surprise me because in pat i was preoccupied wet being an a bit purishabat in a bit snobby thinking not come on that is deffeny no kanowak well i cas of carmounds i look for to a day when supplements are no longer called supplements because at the end of the day whether not something has an effect whether not it is a whole keywe fruit or a dirivet of keyw fruit will depend on the molecular compound and as you mention this am potential mechanism via the gaba system am that is i that we both as scientist get excited about mechanism cause when you can ise a mechanism and pathway provides a rationala grounding for why key wee of all things or tartchery of all things might help a increased total sleep time a i'd be remiss if i did not mention or ask about triptopan and seratonan i can an totally say when i've taken trip to fan the precersir to seratonan or sratonan itself i have a horandis night sleep i fall asleep very easily and i experience ridiculously vivid dreams neither pleasant nor unpleasant as kind of a missmash and then i wake up and i experience several days of insomnia that and i've done the the pas if control in the negative control at all the variations thereof to confirm that at least for me supplementing with seratonergic agents is a bad idea for me m and am triptopan is a common sleep supplement and sleep aid that that is discussed the normal architecture of sleep involves the release of saratona but in a very timed and regulated way what your thoughts about seratonan in slep of ye odtocan a put that into a nutshell and then why supplementing sup with saratonan and or its precursor a trip to pan might be a good or a bad idea for somebody i think one of the potential danges is that bastd on what is going on in your body that can change the absorption of natural to of triptophan and seratonan uptake within the brain itself i'm always thoughtful when you'r playing aran with that mother nature dynamic as it were the data as you described as a little bit all over them ap some people say that it knocks them out other people say just you do it has a terrible impact on my sleep and when i stap it is pretty bad for a couple of days and seems to have this lingering after e fact if think what could be happening here is we need seratonan to just as you described to be modulated in very specific ways during the different stages of sleep if you look at the firing of the a'm brain epy centers were seratonan in is release than there is a bunch of them in the brain stem what you find and the release of of of a seratonin too when we are awake it is usually in high concentrations as we start to drift off to sleep it lowers some but not necessarily dramatically as we going into nonrem sleep but then when we go in to rem sleep seratonin is shut off the other one of the other nor amodulators nora dranalin also shut off remsleep is the only time during the twenty for our period where we see noradranalin and seratonan or norapineffran completely shut down when i say seratonan worls are talking five ach teep p strike five ah tea that is just its chemical a name here am whether it uld speaking about seratone or five ach teas the same thing nor apanefran noradranalin both of those need to be shut down for you to produce rem sleep the other one of the other nour amodulators that then ramps up to produce rem sleep is acatile coly these three nouramodulators have this incredible reciprocal dams that they have for you to generate what is called and natural architecture of sleep throughout the night it is the pushpull again it is a pushpull again it is it is chest tem back it is whatever you want to think of the that is why i think if you are trying to increase dramatically drive up your seratonan levels at night and that sustains throughout the night when you are trying to get into rem sleep you could be artificially fragmenting remsleep now i do not know the data i do not think any one's really got now data ivedonit why i would be if you were to say mat two years time that is the dato help me understand the potential mechanism or let us design some experiments where would you go first i would say let us look at the desrruption of rem sleep nonrem sleep reciprical regulation because you need seratonin to be up at one time down at another ai i am agree with everything you said and i'm am i'm personally never taking trip to venar seratonand again unless there'e some clenical reason for that i that non need to do that i want a ask about on some other pro sleep behaviors but before i do nap let us talk about naps i love naps i come from a long history of nappers amy dad always took a nap in the afternoon i take a twenty or thirty minute nap or i do a practices whach i am took the liberty of qinting andest ar non sleep dy brass some sort of just passive laying orty now there feet up elevated sometimes people do you were i'll do yoganedri'll do hypnosis or something that sort but twenty or thirty minutes of that has been very beneficial for me to get up from nat nap or period of o minamill wakefulness will call it and go about my day quite well and also fall asleep just fine what er the date u on naps a do you nap and what are your thoughts about keeping nap short meaning twenty to thirty minutes verses getting out past ninety minutes two hours a for you personally naps ye nay or i do not nap am and i've just never been a habitual napa is that because you do not feel sleepy in the afternoon or dica sleep do not feel asleepy you are just hardier than i'm i would not say haudie i may be am less capable of fulling a sleep a but gi not the ra ry afternoon no no i do not drag do not nap because you do not feel a a mee to nap that is right yap now it is not that i am immune to what we call the postprandial dip in elutness i definitely feel as though that can be this canno afternal afternoon lull wa you kno i'm not quite as on as i was at eleven ofclock in the morning and we know the physiology to that which brings us back to whether we would design to nap for naps we have done lots of different studies and othe colleagues of done these thaties two naps can have some riddy great benefits we have found benefits for codyovescular health blopressia for example we' found benefits for levels of courts us all weve found benefits for learning in memory and also emotional regulation how long are the naps typically in those studies anywhere between twenty minutes to nighty minutes sometimes we to use a nighty minute window that the potis but can have a full cycle of sleep and therefore they get both nonrem and rem sleep within that time priot than when we wake them up we usually wait a period of time to get them past what we call sleep in nasha which is that kind of window of grogginess way you say to you bet's ta hoff look younef dawling please do not speak to me for the fi hour nathin iv do not anything right now after hno ta hour of waking up you o i'm not just i'me just not the best fersion of mysalvr we wait for that time perd and then we do some testing and we have done some testing before and after and we look at the change and that is how we measure what was the benefit of naps the reason why we sometimes do nighty minutes that they get all of those stages of sleep and then we correlate how much benefit did you get from the nap and how much of that benefit was explained by what remsleep you got what deep sleep you gat what light sleep you got that is the only reason that we use thap as an experimental tool what we have also found is that naps of as little as seventeen minutes can have some quite potent effects on for example learning none of this is novel naser pioneer this back in the nineteen nighties and during the missions they were experimenting with naps for their astronaults and what they found was that naps of little as twenty six minutes improved am amission performance by thirty four per cent and improved daytime alertness by fifty percent and it burth what was then called the naser nap culture throughout all terrestrial naser snap during that time period it is long been known that naps can have a benefit naps however can have a double edge sword there is a dark side to naps and it comes back to our story of a denesene and sleep pressure the longer we are awake the more of that sleep pressure denaesne that we build up but what i did not tell you is that when we sleep the brain gets the chance to essentially clear out that a denesene and after about sixteen hours of wakefulness and then after about eight hours of sleep eight hours of sleep seems to be able too allow the brain to dee crease it is a denesene levels bak too normal and naptually we should start to wake up which also alines with your cicadian withthm and those are too separate processes but with about eight hours of good quality sleep seven to nine hours of the average edult we are free of all of thap a denesne we have avacuated it essentially out of the brain and we wake up naturally feeling refreshed the reason that naps can be protentially dangerous is that when you nap you are essentially opening the valve on the pressure cooker of sleep pressure shand some of thap sleepiness is lost by way of the nap for some people and not all people and you are great example of this some people however if they are struggling with sleep at night and they nap during the day it makes their sleep problems even worse for people within somnia we typically advise against napping and the advices if you can nap regularly and you do not struggle with sleep at night then naps are just fine but if you do struggle with sleep stay away from naps if you are going to nap try to limit your naps try to cut them off a bit likes hat of caffine maybe eight to twelve hours may be not thap far off may be said of seven to six hours is a good rule of thumb try not to nap essentially late in the afternoon and if you do take a nap and you want to maintain yor you do not want to have that groggin as hang over that can happen after a full night of sleep for the first hour try to limit it to about twenty twenty five minutes and that way you do not go down into the very deepest stages of sleep which i if i rench you out off with an alarm then you just canno feel you almost feel wus for the first hour after the nap i've defily externs tthat if i oversleep certainly if o the sun goes down during my nap and i wake up and light over all lighting conditions hofe changed i find it very hard to jolt myself back into the evening and it it can screw me up yi trynd keep those naps pretty brief and i should say i i'm very happy to hear you mention individual differences and why some people might want a nap and other people might not want to nap a i have a colleague leechon low ill be familiar to to many nrbal just ewhe is a absolute spectacular scientists o member the national cademy hourd he is investigator just o fenom and a as a ton of energy but years ago i learned that he always takes a nap in the afternoon much that when he travels to give seminars at other universities he will tell his post lunch it perhost whoever it is that he is pus to meet with may i have your office for thirty minutes of our sometimes thirty minute i discussion or sixty minute discussion cause i to take a nap and he does that and then gives is his talks are typically in the afternoon in academic culture and he describes the the effect of the nap for him these short naps in the afternoon being profound for his productivity that is i shold what inspire me to start feeling o key about my desired nap and i think ot for me that was great vindication for those that might feel guilty about wanting a nap but i i take to heart your note about avoiding naps if you have trouble falling in staying o sleep cause i think that i i've family members who also if they nap they are reck they cannot sleep e i think it is just we have often being very pro sleep we as sit of sleep community i think it is good to always point out these potential dogsides of of any aspect but you are absolutely right no one should feel guilty about getting the sleep that they need and i think that is being one of the big problems in society society a stigmatize sleep with these labls of being slothful ol lazy and we are almost embarrassed to tell colleagues that we we take a nap i think sleep is a right of human beings and i the full think that sleep is a civil right of old human beings and no one should make you feel unproud of getting the sleep that you need i i love that and it is an important point am i also feel that one of the best ways to beat your competition in any endeavor is to outlive them soand now that we know that an enhance a lunchevity and lack of sleep can shorten one's life that is all the justification i need any nay a can somebody sleep too much is a osible to get too much sleep it is a very good question and there are probaly too things to say about it there is a condition that we call hyposomnia but that is a mixture of things it is where people have either a very high sleep need or they are very sleepy during the day and their typically falling asleep and these can happen in at a variety of different clinical contexts one of the places where we have often seen hyporsomnea believed to manifest is in depression but if you look at some of those sthudies it turns out it looks more as though those people are simply reporting being in bed longer but not necessarily sleeping longer and that fits very well with one of the profiles that we know of depression which is anadonia you do not get pleasure from normnwy pleasuable things you just do not want to go out into the world you do not want to interract because you depresse what you do you just stay in bed lion talos watching to you ray and that jitt looks as though when people say what time did you go to bed and what time did you get out of bed the mistake made in that question is okay that is how much time the sleeping when you should have said what time did you fall asleep and what time did you wake up and the answer could be very different that typosomnia from a clinical context can you sleep too much though one of the data points that argues yas that is possible is when we look at all cause mortlity certainly what you find is that using the sweet spot of seventor nine hours when you start to drop below seven hours there is a relationship which suggest that the shorto your sleep the short to your life short sleep in that regard predicts all cause mortality but it is again not a linea relationship the wone that we have seem with rem sleep once you get past nine hours the mortality curve stops going down and then wants you get further ten or leven ours it hucks back up again it is almost a ja shape tilted over a little bit and reversed as this strange huck what is going on here right now sleep science has at least too non mutually exclusive explanations for this the first is that if you look at some of those populations the idea is that the whatever was causing them illness and took their lives was just too much for sleep to deal with however we know that when we get sick one of the things that we do immediately in this a whole mechanism and in flametary mechanism cyticimediated when we get sick we want to sleep were we just want to kellup in bed and youn sleep it up sleep it off the argument there is that it is not that sleep was killing people prematurely it was that these people were calling on the the help of sleep they were calling on thes thing called the swiss army knife of health that is sleep but whatever it is that they were facing was just too powerful for s leep to overcome it artificially looks as though more sleep leads to a highe risk of death when sleep was atchlhe responding to the mortality risk and it lost the battle that is one argument the second is that we know that sleep quality and poor sleep efficiency is a very strong predictor of all cause mortality and when you look at people who often report sleeping long amounts ten or eleven hours they typically report having very poor quality sleep because their quality of sleep is poor they just try to sleep longer to try and get some of that back again here now it is poor quality sleep masking as too much sleep leading too this artificial huck which looks mortality that is a second explanation a third which is more of a godunkan which is just cannot a thought experiment and i'm of this mentality i do not know how many other people share this i actually think there could be a thing as too much sleep physiologically i think it is possible but the reason i think that is because it is no different than food water or oxygen can you over eat yes you can can you under eat of course or lige light in their early wonder the day or throughout the day wonderful light late in the day night at night detrimental by directional for water can you over hydrate hypen an neutrema it can lead you kow it happened in the ninety nineties and two thousand with the ecstasy craze were governments were saying your dehydrating you dancing all night please drink water and they drank too much water the blood electrolights when all over the place and they were having carty acaresces or stroke that people dine and they were dying because of excessive hydration can you get too much oxygen hyperoc emia and it can cause free radical damage which can be profoundly harmful and kill brain cells can you sleep too much which is the fifth element of their life equation alongside food water oxygen a forthi should say cannot even count clearly i'm sleeping well an yes i think there could be that possibility ar most people in danger of getting too much sleep o contrary if you look at phe datar e but ii do not dismiss that idea i think it is it is possible it is it is a very thorough and very new artst and you'r very clear answers i i on it is interesting to think that a lot of the the the date o that out there that tog ou out being in bed too long that it is just trying to compensate for the actual fragmentation of sleep the ut i'm coming away with is that they are many pats to this and ar both positive and things to avoid but the ideas to get most night ay similar amount probably seven an nine hour somewhere in there of hig quality sleep that the noth of sleep quality is going to become i would hope a a phrase that more people think about and learn about and cultivate as a practice a one ask about a a set of behaviors that i'm at least i'm aware of at least one company a starting to track in their sleep monering device and that is am organasm and sex orgasm and masterbation topics that are i are somewhat am sensitive am but afrom the prospective biology ad a a none of us would be here or we are not for a sper mes egg in some fashion either in additor or in vivo am but what what are the data as as them to be or maybe lavs even doing this kind of a work and exploration about the roll that sex worgasm masterbation play in getting to sleep and stayined is a sleep and sleep quality certainly those behaviors and those of physiological events ave been part of our evolutionary history am what is the story there and what can we say about this in in terms of science and and there ais a practice ye a men it is almost that caricature of yern the movis wa ye a couple makes lav and than all of a sudn you just soit of hi snoring or you knewt haves with the idea that itsomewhat somneganic that it is sleep promoting well the pasorgasmic increase in prolac well that is is here is is is interest ought to be a a set a naturally curing saditive there presumably has a function in an oxitoson has that also that benefit we you see a dissipation of the fights or fight brench of the nov system which has to happen feu to full asleep that is why we often see ou know here at the sleep senso will see if phenomenon called wiat and tired whet people say look i am desperately tired i a i just iam tired but i cannot full asleep because i'm too wired you'r sleep drive you'r you are desperately tired it is that but because you are wired because you have got too much sympathetic activation too much caurts us all as well you cannot full asleep it is a it is an impressive road block to anythink good sleep and it is one of the principull mechanisms that we now believe stress and physiological activation that is the underlying cause of many forms of insomnia but coming back to sex the data is at tuallep quite compelling that both either subjectively assessed sleep quality or objective amounts of sleep sex that has resulted in ol gasm and i think it is tha that lasta part that typically needs to happen i would imagin sia that between too mutualy exclusive a individuals a wer both ar beneficial in times of receiving an organasm i we ha day any discussion about sex we are referring to consensial age appropriate species appropriate context approbow i write and never eveven gone i le o se ein tere because ie te intering et and people will come up with o ousiddea i i think that a ae apopriate i think age appropriate consensual and context appropriating species appropriate covers all the bases gi let any pic them in the comment section and and lb sure to take note yad nithing it is i that is realdy well said i'm an important to say the dato is thawhen you look at couples ho have orgasm we have also however found benefits of mastabation and it is not frequently spoken about but what it if you do some serveys it tuns out that people will often use mastibation as a sleep tool if the struggling with sleep and i know this it sounds almost a strange conversation or it is a tobucomosition but i i think we just need to be very open aba started off in science am one of the things i worked on a early my career not the very first topic was the topic of early influences of hormons estergen into sastron on sexual development of the brain and nody and when you are weand in a laboratory that regardless of what era you look at sec and it is pbehaviors and it is hormones and its physiologies as a scientist and soit that is to be clear what we are doing here were exploring these umthese behaviors from that from that perspective one thing is for certain every one is here because a sperm medaneg either in addish or in vevo as we said before and a at least in twenty twenty one there is there is no way around that fact heram and what preceded that is typically this act we call sac and sometimes hopefully a i to think worgasm is associate with that sexual activity nacerbation as one dimension of that is something that i think it can on should be discussed if in fact therare data that relate it to sleep ye anmd both of those routes seem tolad to i'm a sleep benefit now i'm not saying that it is all about the orgassm i think as we spoke about with oxitosin there is some degree of pa bonding that if you have a potna and you experience an intimate loving relationship that involves that thand you can have homonol benefits that ar sleep promoting that may not necessarily be seen if you are just engaging in the solo singular act of mastabation i'm what we sently known and i i 'm not some ones take any advice on when it comes to and i think relationship wise or sex uise i divin apisode yes certainly and that is not apoca series that i'm going to be releasing any times saing to cing to be mostly about a sleep although i will touch on i'll release upon gest on sleep and sex but that is the dato that we have far we also know that it works both ways though and it is commonly this the same way with sleep a you now sleep an exercise sleep and diet how you eat can effect how you sleep how you sleep can effect how you eat same with exercise and it turns out it is the same way with sexual behaviour too here were talking about whether sex can help with sleep can sleep help with your relationship and sex and the answer is yes it can firstly we know and we spoken a little bit about this that the reproductive hormones are under profound sleep regularly showth estrogen and tust astro estragones testastron is we hereis or an aas tars as well but women who or i should say any one whois interested in having higher levels of astrogen or or normal healthy levels of estrogen a i presume the day do show for astrogen what the date also show yosir morly for tust tastosgon if you get too little or poor quality of sleep both sex tore in hormones as ther referred to tust astron grand astrogen which are present in both males and females and every variation thereof or going to be diminished belon normal healthy yels grestrogen sestostrone a effes h in women a akey hormone in the regulation a for a kee for conception of course all of these sex hormones seem to become significantly desrupted when sleep becomes of short quantity or por quality we also know that in women a sleep disruption can usually lead to menstrual psychal disruption we know this particulaly from evidence in shift working women where they re night timeshift workers they struggle with sleep during the day often menstration is destrupted or even becomes impad but we also know it works this way not just for sex hormones but for sex itself for example we found that for every one hour of sleep extrasleep that a woman gets ha interest in becoming sex sleep intimate with her partner increases by fourteen percent which is ands anonderirial amount and then the final part of i think this equation when it comes to sleep and sex is your your relationship itself and though some great work here from you see bokly by a professor serena chan and what chie found was that restless nights mean for far more brutal fights in your relationship and they did this an invinumberous of different elegant ways and vice firster as well am we not that i've ever had conflict an relationship a me n lig in a i jus this us ist days triter ad of never experience that it is all a and they found reliably that sleep would predict hia likely herd of relationship conflict secondly if you got into that conflict the chances if you resulving it was significantly lea when the poties ha not being sleeping well pat of the reason is because when you are not well slept your empathy goes down your not your taking more of an agrasive stents with yourpatna roth than emo agreeable stents with you patna it almost every dimension of a human leving relationship sleep can have a dramatic impact i think these are really important things to under score one of the most common questions i get because there seems to be a community of people on the internet that are obsessed with this am i do not know who they are because it is all all this internetstelf a shouting into a tomnec an and conents back ind written formance a very bazaare conversation thi i to speak am is whether or not sexual behavior itself lowers are increases testostrone and i went into the data which expands many decades actually both animal studies in human studies and it seems a just to underscore the as long as were talking about the subject that am it does seem that sexual activity sects bebetween two people does seem to increase testosterone in both there is this question about orgaasm or no orgaasm ejaculation no ejaculation ana and indeed there do seem to be some effects of of am of restricting ejaculation in mals has a form of further increasing testosterons of sex without ejaculation further increasing teststrone but the data are not clean a presumably because organizing these sorts of studies and getting truth in in self reporting is probably hard to get from from subjects but but it everything sort of points in the direction that provided that the relationship is a healthy one it is its consensualsage appropriate contects appropriate species appropriate that sec between two individuals does seem to increase the sextroid harmons testostron and estrgen toward healthy ranges and what i'm hearing now the sort gestalt of of the discussion we just had is that that to can promote sleepiness restful states and quality sleep and i think this is an important conversation that just has not been held enough i mang sooner or later am both in the you ass and elsewhere we are going to have to acknowledge that we are biological organisms of some sort and that we have choice in life about all these things from supplementation to sects or no sects et cetera but that they have profound effects on our corbiology i mean it is fascinating to me that the areas of the hypothalemus the preoptic areia the superoptic areas those areas which the names might not mean anything to anybody besides a nat ini sitting here but those area sit cheek to jowl with each other in the hypothalemus and control sleep and sects the trigger of orgaasm the appetite for food yo appetieoter for electro lights i mean i buthalmus is kind of a a festival of of norons with different booths for different i just fror mewyhazes ols ature in the brain but it is the ochistrator of the fast number of our behave is disproportiona it somes of its sizef us is a fact i do not think you can go to this hypothilamic festival without it is a at least seeing all the booths whether r not you decide oin or not a am masternalogy am i'mn't i'm glad that we have broach that conversation and i hope people will will think that we have approached to with the appropriate level sensitivity it is it is an imrdnt one that we are going to hear more about one way or the other people are certainly thinking about this if not engaging in in these sorts of behaviors or avoiding them im the more we can understand about the miology the better sum and thank you for bringing that topic up because for the record mat a tabled it for discussion we cen to a cat ting outside ything said something about the erthativ sect an i sur aut we can go tha that is lech interesting ab absolutely i want a touch on just tremaining topics one is are there any unconventional sleep tips or things about sleep that that we have overlooked if if we covered everything great but im here to keep the room cool we hear a because of this temperature phenomenon the light aspects the considerations about alcohol c b d maroana im cognof behaviour all tartchery fo n weas perhaps perhaps please do not put me on the hyetchers yeiis just offering what i know nois enes e considerations and and whether not people abatch these things i i will not even list them off now because theyre too many jokes that one on c and i have no affiliation with any of these products i'm ovinan take out a tout anythin we company n a but the question i have is about any unconventional or lesser known things or maybe you do things or you think about things just in a purely a exploratory way as a scientist o that thet the what if a kind of things that an what if it turns out that and i hear i just i ve got a blank there for you to fill in i think you beyond the stand a fair that ive dished out plenty of times of sleep higen af regularity temperatured dognes im alcohol cafi an we have we have spoken about all of those what is some more unconventional tips i guess the first one which is unconventional along lines of naps if you have had a bad nights of sleep let us say that youre stocting to image with in somnia and you have had a bat nights of sleep the advice and i land this fror my wonderful call it michael palace do nothing what i mean by that is do not wake up any later do not sleep in the following day to try and make up for it do not nap during the day do not consume extra caffine to wake you up to try to get you through the day and do not go to bed any earlier to think that you are going to compensate and i can explain all of those things but if you wake up later you are not going to be sleepy until latto the evening you gong to go to bed at your normal time and you will not be sleep in you will think while i just came off a bad night of sleep and now i i still a'm i cannot even get to sleep and it is my normal time 'sbecause you slept in later than you would otherwise and you reduce the window of a denacine accumulation before your normal bed time do not go do not wake up any later do not use more caffine for the reasons at that are obvious because that is only ging to crank you nt keep you awake the fllowing night or decrease the probability of a good following night of recovery sleep im third i'm i mention do not take naps because once again that will just tak you non't naps particularly later in the afternoon i almost liken them to snacking before a main meal it just takes your appetit off the edge of that main meal of sleep do not do it and then finely do not go to bed any earlier resist and resist and go to bed at your normal time what i want to try and do is prevent you from thinking while i had such a bad night last night and i normally go to bed at ten thirty i'm ju ging to get into bed at nine ofclock because last night was just bad but that is not your natural bed time and it is not a lined with your natural crono type because presumably you can ive know something about that our morning time evening time you tran ta sleep in harmony which is yusleep or how you get best quality sleep but you go to bed at nine and my body is not ready to to sleep at nine ofclock but i'm worried because i had a bad night of sleep last night i get into bed and now i'm tossing in turning for the first hour and a half because it is not my natural sleep window but i just thought it was a good idea and if i did not know anythng about sleep i would think all of these same things too as i'm not finger wagging but after if i have a bad night of sleep and i am not immune just because i know a little bit about sleep does not mean i do not have my bad nights i do does not mean i have not had bouts of insomnia in my life i have but after a bad night of sleep i do nothing i do not do any of those for things i think the second tip i'm i would offer in terms of unconventional its have a wind down routine many of us think of sleep as if it slike a light switch that we just domp into bed and when we turn the light out sleep should arrive in that same way to the binery it is honor it is off sleep is a physiological process it is much more landing a plain it takes time to gradually to send down on to the terra farmer of what we call good solid sleep at night find out whatever works for you and it could be stretching i usually meditate an for about ten or fifty minutes a before bad some people reading try not to watch tel vision in bad that is odeally it dlis it is you will not you are how much too activating no you can listen to relaxing codcast although we can speak about technology in the bedroom to but have some kind of a wine down routine it is i it is almost you would not race into your garrage and come to it screeching halt from sixty miles an hour you typically down shifty gears and you slow down as you come into the arrage this the same thing with with sleep to that is the second thing have some kind of a wine down routine find what works for you maybe it is taking a hot bath or a warm shower and then stick to it just we do this with kids all the time we find out what they'r bedroom strry their bed time regiment is and then we just stick to it faithfully but we humans are the same way to the third thing is a myth do not count sheep ifs a study done here it you see bugly i did not do this thedy i wish it did it is by my colleague professor ous and harvey and they found that counting sheep actually made it harder to fall asleep made matters worse as a conter a sorry counter a measure to that what they did find was that taking yourself on some kind of a mental walk think about an nice work that you take in nature or a walk on the beach or even a walk around and erbit is you iromon and visualizing thad that seem to be beneficial the other thing about am sot of that idea of shifting focus away from your mind itself get your mind off itself is a good piece of advice catharsis you can try to write down all f the concerns that you have and do this not write before bad but usually an hour or two before bad some people call call it a worry journal and to me it is a little bit closing down all of the emotional tabs on my browser because if i shut the compuser down and all o those tabs are still open i'm gong to come back in the morning the compusers red heart the fans going because it did not go to sleep because it could not because there were too many tabs active and open i think it is the same way with sleep as well try to think about doing that just vomit oun all your concerns on the page a ive thet lithery am waking as often associated with me riding down the lists of things that i've regard to do that i need to do ye and in in once i eventually wake up from the later night a si can have of the night sleep thatstoft seems much more tractable and reasonable but a sure would be great to get that stoff out of the way before sleep well there is also something that i do not think people ofe spoken about a lot and i'd to research it which is difficulty and anxiety at night in the dar alk is not the same difficulty and anxiety in the light of day and when we have those thoughts at night it comes with a magnitude of rumination and catastrophiz ation that is disproportionate to that which you would describe when you are awake and i do not know what is going on about the brain and thought and in motion at the time i've got a bunch of theoriesis to why and that is why i the idea of closing up zipping up all of those differend components just get them out on the page and it feel and i at first thought this just sounds who it sounds very buckly it is can nat come by our we all hold hands and well come at the end of the day but then this the datis though's coming out ready gouds thaties from good people and they found that keeping one of those generals decrease the time it takes you to fall asleep by fifty per cent five ero it is well on cal with any phomsuitical agent o absetuna i'm convince that i've long thought that the worriese in concerns and ideas i have at three for i m i've learned to not place any stock in them ye because ever something i'm glad that you might am decide to eventualy look at this in your laboratory because i you something is melted away or altered i suspect it in the a the regulation of the autonomic nervous system that it make sense why i concern at three for i m ought to evoke more of a panic sense than i concern cance and certainly that is my experience although not i fortune do not suffer from fullblown paanic attacks but everything seems worse at three for i m y aded your awake and we we need to to t look into that because if you look at suicide rates around the twenty for our clock face disproportionately higher rates in those middle s at of night hours now now i do not know if that is coursitive or not but something i could just be that that is the time when were mostly lonely and were by ourselves and that is the reasons has got nothing to do with sleep all the night time i do not know am that is the third thing i think the fourth sat of little tip i would give that is unconventional is remove old clock faces from your bedroom including your phone including your phone and resist checking it now i know and i can speak about the phone to that genie of technology is out the bottle and it is not going back in any time soon we have got to think of scientists and sleep scientist as to what we do with u nophones in the bette obut i a years ago was a councert o summer camp i worked with atris kids and the am there was a phrase that comes to mine here its be a channel not a dam because we ma shy and damn certain kinds of behavior am physically damn certain kinds of behavior not morally dam am that to a it s drreaps over the edge and you get and you get a a waterfall im see ha as gan ol the phona and devices have to be worked with in negotiated not's right and d think about those mindfully to but clock faces remove all of those because if you are having a tough night knowing that it is three twenty two in the morning or it is full forty eight in the morning does not help you in the slightest and it is only going to make mattes worse than bette try to remove old clock faceis i think that is one of those o the tips that some people af found helpful but those would be said of some slightly uncon ventional i guess more than your stock fare of here the five tips for sleep i gene to night and those are terrific sleep tips and u'm several of which if not all of which i'm going to incorporate that this has been an amazing a deep dive on sleev and it is positive and negative regulators i howpe it has not been too long and i i dos has been great cut it down shorten it too a have sine te minutes of mamsolalhat i a but absoluly not ever it it is chalka black ful of valuable take aways it is been a a tremendously fun for me to a disact out this incredible aspect of our lives that that we call sleep with a fellow scientist and a a fellow public educator i want to say ium several things first of all we should say where people can find you although i tshould not be that difficult these day as youare here a very present on the on the internet for for better for worse i think it is wonderful that you are out the look it is a public health service that you'r doing i kno one requires you or any other scientist to get out and im share this information my sense of you knowing you a bit and from fall on your work very closely buth your scientific work in detail and your public facing i educational work is that you very much want the best for people and it is it is an interesting thing as a scientist or clinition to a know that the that certain answers exist that we do not have all the answers but that there is a better path or our better ways and people can benefit in a myriad of ways im for that because i know that to be very genuine in you you want the best for people and you'r offering tremendous advice and and considerations and people can take it or leve it and that is the way of you it i also on o thnk you for taking the time out of your day to a to sit with me here and have lite discussion a itle it is a privilege it is in delight you and i am i think well kind in lots of ways and i take you as a as a shining example of how you can effectively connect with the public and i know that we have had our conversations before we heve sat down together about how to think about communicating with the public and the prosen cuns of that and i've just loved your opinions a a been drinking it all in and then i think the thing i'd to say is thank you for being such an incredible sleep ambassador the series that you have released on sleep the way that you sleep about sleep the way that you moterate an of champion sleep it is remarkable thank you for just being a brother in arms in that way yarns and and thanks for those those words am ninety nine per cent wha i discuss there was the work of you and your colleagues in the sleep field proper noedgmen but thank you a werkan people it learn more about what you are doing currently and what is coming next you are on twitter i am on am twita itifically tweet a'm as the sleep diplomat it is it is no it is just sleep diplomat sleep to wil mat ssleep w demplomat on twita sleep diplomat do com website i if you want to learn more about the science that we do here it is human sleep science dot come it is the sensr for human sleep science i'm you can a pick up a copy of the book if you want it is called why we sleep if you curious about sleep a that is one path to take in it is is there another my youlay in the in the future i think there may be yi i acma many many millions of people will be very happy to that tin get's it is sarting to to take hold and than i'm as we discuss i am a more than kicking around the idea of a short form potcastarot in the long form i not long form because a i do not have the mental capacity or the interviewing am just keepability that some one you has it will probe just be monologue short form if there is some interest i'll probably do that as well those are the ways that people can find me but over all if you are interested in sleep just listen to andru that is nothing i can tell i well now now 'rebcting back and forth the a vector of action to speak but i'm i do hope you will start upodcast however brief or lengthing thise episodes i turn out to be because i do believe that is a great venu to get information out into the world and am we do not just a want to hear more from mat walker i speak for many people a we need to the work you are doing is both am influential but more importantly it is important work it it has the impact that needed especially in this day ind age were science and medicine public health and hthe issues of the world at cetera are really converging i know i speak on behalf of a tremendous number pyeou wanted to say thank you for doing the work you do and for being you and thanks fully in o f a good friend likewise to am and by the way a i just going to note that it was nice that the two of us both got the im johnny cash a memau about house a dress to day it seems as though both can af a we got that same memo which wwill mean nothing to people who are listening but if you

bog down by specious legal cases and elevated toward the republican presidential omination because of them donald trump faces almost insurmountable obstacles to the white house deven archer tells tunker crawson about his special relationship with hunter and by nomix means america's credit being down grated i'm beenshkur of this is benchpara show the benshpira shows spons rob express ve pian i talk about them every single show why have not you gottin if e pianyet get expressiv pian right now at expressive pans i cam slashman all righty today the former presidents of the united states is expected to appear in person for its arrainment in federal court in washington d cs soeregongto get another o j simpson day where the president is trail by hellacoppters as he leaves marlogo and then he gets on a plan and thn ho goes to washington d c and thn goes into a courthouse an then he actets a court house hon wegong t get all the usual hollabaloo abot how this is historic and it is the biggest thing that is happened in te united states since everer an it is an amazing amazing day for e left that a'll gongto be celebratig thatall goin o be whoing it is going o be exciting we have done this several times at this point because trum of course had to go to new york for arrainment and then he had to be in florida and maami for arrinment naas been washington to see forn rayment soat's the arrainment world to er here with the with the trump campagn and this is not donal trumpsfall because this inditement i's garbage the indictment as i discussed yesterday his chargeing crimes they are not actual crimes they they are suggesting that donal trum for example committed some sort of fraud against the governments of the united states which is a li that is not in fact how that wall works wut they wanted to charged him with was incitement but they really want his charge mith was he is the one who created the rion on january six but the probimence does not fulfill the actural elements of incitement because incitement under american waw requires the actually tell people to go do the thing i's not enough to say well you now i really really do not thatguy and then somebody goes they burn down the guy's house that is not enough yeft say i want you go to that guy's house and burn down his house and hears his address and tat the latter is incitement trum did not do that he is said on january six go peacefully protest patriotically protest at the capital building and then he did not do enough to get people out but again that is not the same things incitement that is not an actual crime is just him being a bad president at that time which again his activities during january six i think we'r greges i thing his activities between the election in january six particularly in the aftermouth of state certification ovotes i thing it was wrong i thing was false hithing is none of that is crime it turns it can do lots of things in america that i personally think our greegous wrong in damaging to te country they are not crimes happens pretty much all the time and every single day former president trump again he is going to show up in washington d c in order to be arrains and this just under scores the fact that not only could presiden trumps life be at risk here because he now faces seventy eight felloongy charges across three criminal cases if trump were convicted on all counts according to politico and given them actomum statutory penalty for each one he would face a wopping six hundred and forty one years in prison which i soon means hou ad nots or out prison although he is seventy per cent preservatives at this point because he eats much mc donalds and diacoke that is not counting additional criminal charge you you might face in georgia the actual plausible criminal term is probaly nothing that in both state and federal course judges have wide latitude in sentencing none of the crimes trump has been charged with carry manditory minmum sentence the fenns with no prir criminal record rarely receive the maximum and sending trum to prison could raise pretty on president tof practical an legal issues given the factit right now he is the most likely person o be the republican candidate for president there is the actual real possibility the donaltrum could be campaigning from prison in the middle of next year which again hi drama and maybe i mean i would love as ye a presidential debate in which jobidon being corrupt thi hunter and having violated the locyou could the oredically have a presidential debate in which you have the candidates in actual jail sells a cross from each other at fullsom and just shouting at each other across the hallway as flaming bed sheets fall around them which frank lould be more ancertaining the most presidential debates at this by butt is this a miscarriage of just as yt in this indictment shunotco for it i discussed it at length yesterday not only that it is very clear that jacksmith wants thi stuff prosecuted as fast as humanly possible thonnaltrumps defencitorny john lauro he said prosecutors want a force to trial in sixty to ninety days if i get my mouthright that means that they want ta force the trial in october november at some time presumably before the primaries begin the proscators thats let us go to trial i'm ready and seventy days faire not eare not ready and seventy days how bi ni r ha i i tri hav i e pri ais out he have three and a half hears flatil make it epall what a the bottom line is that they have sixty federal agents working on this sixty lawyers all kinds of government a personel and and we get this an divven and they want to go to trialin ninetydays tust that soun justice to you on m a just in the pris ier ti wes in never a i ts ao te trial is atu ais to force a former pres in the inivited states to trial in ninety days when you have hav three years tlisi well now to ther're they are two things that are happening right here from a a sort of political perspective one is the entire election tychael will now be about january sixth o bout ton trum's activities is legal activities tho bout class by documents that is what the election's going to be about and that is what democrats want the elect youn do about they would love nothing better han that is why y have michael bish loss wis the world's worst historian and write speeches for jobidon comparing january six to nine eleven which again this is such an absurdity i'm sorry january six was a was a rally that turned into a fairly small scale riot in the contact of the twenty twenty rices wicers most damaging riots an american history and froms a property damage and and you many lives were lost michael bish lost comparing a bunch of dults going into the capital building and by the way killing no one o ka because ththe reality is that the one officer who died brin sicnac died afterward and it is unclear that the cause of death was directly related to january sex butt put all that the only person omactually was killed that they was actually babit of course comparing that to nine eleven and which three thous an americans died in a full skall attack on the united states including both the world's ratescenter and the pendagon comparing that to pearl harbor i michaelbishlosses he his a terrible historian but this is the narrative pearl harbor nineteen forty one we were bond persisten was very much in danger our democracy many people were getting adoc cran cay thet theyld do the democracy hat sy thits last days prat curos ofoul help to put a coalition together at the last neten to save democracy an tratim round the world nine leven two thousand one osom op in latan another tarris hated our democracy try to destroyer you see where i'm going what we see in this an divemen is that on january six twenty twenty one donald trop just those ot their threats to american democracy try to destroyersist o ga he is now comparing donal trom to osoneman loden and hero heto thethen the thezuour democrats one gone the gloves run this election they ran the slesh in plabocan twenty twenty thy ran the sflesh n plaboock an twenty twenty two and it actually went pretty well for them i remember a lot of us were retty exercised about what i think is still the worst precidential speech i've ever seen given jo bion's bizar and fishistic speech in frunt of independence hall were he completely miss red what liberty is and then declared olifis political opponent's enemies of the republic blood read inde pendance hall with the soldiers flanking inthe background youremember all of that but it actuay worked out fairly well politically for ms o democrats one a re run that playbooks that is point number one point number two is that if you bog down you'r political opponents with bloss youd after loss yould after lawsuit criminal case haveter criminal case haver cr that that keeps him pretty busy and not only that if you haid with bunch crinal cases they are pretty obviously politially motivated it elevates him in the primaries democrats are geting hin all the things they want here ell get to that in just one second first let us talk about the fact that big tac big governmenthese are not trust worthy sources they'ld to silence o any descenting voices into submission in fact tey work han an glove together there is literally a story out

a fact in attempt to qon qhat rig the twenty twenty four election again when i say rig i mean it in thse sort of generic scense i do not mean aelect toral fraud i do not mean democrats shipping in balla box in middle tle night or dead people voting in chicago in nineteen sixty or stealing in election for al frank an over norm col men in minisoda that stuff does happen that is on i'm talking bout here when i'm talking about here is the pree rigging of the twenty twenty four election by essentially making donald trump the republican nominy knowing that the amount of baggage he brings into the general is going to drag him down in the general election because that seems to be the most predictible way that the selection cycel goes it is very difficult to believe that independents are going to think re publicans and con servateds on these issues heis most people do not watch the stuff at the granuar levellies he listen to the show you are more politically in formed that about ninety eight per cents of the american public the rest of he public a huge per sendice ofth public does not follow the stuff closely and hes when they see headline after headline after headline suggesting that donal trump is a criminal if they are not in the forty per cent base of donal trump if they are in that ten per cent which tends to be less ingaged tends to be less informed which tends to notless in to con servatofe podcafts but may turn on sean an every often that the the people who catch the news when the'r not reading sport section for those people doyou thin te'regoing to be gran yulotally involved an whether the go ja was weaponized again stonal trump because after all donal trump has been arguing that for years heo was right but those arguments cin not are baked in to the cake the question be comes both practical and messageon on a practical level howisdonal trumpkin can ten with the fact that he is likely to have at least four on going criminal trials in the iddle of the selection cycl husganto do that we already know that his superpack is pending every dollar theyave raised all of them on his legalfie's right now firstal donal trumps most be a billioner he should not be using his superpack money for that donal trump should be paying his own legal bills and when you do not anet money t donal trump it should not go toward his legal defense it should go tor to feeding jobidon by building up a grass retes operation tit is a simple politecs but put that side en fyour fine weat by way donl trump could ave startedto sepperat legal fun and then if hoe wanted to give to his legal fun you could of the sowit he did but put all that aside every dollor donald trump is bringing in is being spent right now on legal every moment the donald trump is on line is being spent thinking about legal everysto often he sides swipes ron to santist just can a keep hem down but most of his folk is right now is going to be on the legal cases and rancing about jack smithan stuff here whall that is an awful exspenditure of time for presidential candidate who needs to run in election in swing states in order to win beyond that think out the practicalities thing about the court dates thing about where he actually has to physically be in many of these cases he is gon to have to be for days or weeks in florida for for his case on classvi documents or n washington you seive for for the generol sixth inditements or in george ov for alect toral interference is itements that are shortly to be coming or in new york for thestorby daniels nonsense he is genough to be in all of this place just on a practical level is the very very difficul case for donald trump to run it is a very rough race because they have set up all o these dopscals gain this wi sa itsbeen rad once you bring a bunch of species alligations against trump and you lock him up in trums of his time in his money for the next you are and a half that is a form of rigging the election and as a ats another component of this by doing this you are also helping to rig the republican primaries in a bazar sort of way when all of the medea coverage goes tor donald trump it' sucks all the ar out room nobody else can compete it means that donald trump with all of his baggage is likely to be the nomine tbecause everybody on the republicanside of the al myself included we all look at trumpet mere that i's being victimized and we would to give him as much power as he can have an or to smack back i get it i totally get it but there is the thing if he loses none of that ththe power of a nomination is no greater than th power of a not nomination the power of the presidency is the thing you need if donald trump does not win giving him the nomination the nacthl help him one i od up not one little bit you need somebody who can win if that person wins presum they culd pardon him theoretically of federal charges they could remake the deeo ja that is the thng we shouldall be focaset on if we actually care about fixing the system and making sure the y do not get bad indictments against political opponents but that require's victories the question really as always comes back to victory again that is the practic out that is that is practicalli number one is his time being stacked up i him being basically jamed op all the way until election day with criminal cases and then again there is message number to which is the message is democratsic in a ram down push it push it push a push in and these criminall cases allow them to do it everyday trumps can being court talkm at it everyday an true sosial talking bout if there is if there is one person who likes talking about trump more than jobidnist donal trump he loves it is favorite thing we in an entire lection cycle of that maybe that' something that you are up for for dramatic purposes or be cut out of loyal tea to to trump on some sort of personal level i i do not blame you for it i get it i'm just asking is the thing that is most likely to result in actual in actual victory as well se in a secon ire's quite pot probable that jobidon basically set all of this up at lest in terms of the indictments that are now coming down from jacksmith illget to that in just one second first we have a great dog his name is happy he is very cute he got groomed yesterday not gob not an middl school he he got a actually clean and groom and i and he is at he is a very very cussiges to have anees and his hair is growing long and he looks a a v a maniversion of chubock up ilike hit is love him which is why we want him

ben today or call eight three three my dog thirty three that is eight three three my dog thirty three o caeso did jobidon rig a lot of this sort of stuff i mean the answer is a cantisounds it this an article from march thirty first two thousand twenty three a few months ago bid insaid what the bidin justisce to partinall do has let thet a pritmen of justice beet te departmen of justice let them make the judgments if we should be prosecuted they are not my lawyers they are not my personal lawyers but and ther's the near time's reporting backin march he does have opinions in the past mister bidon privately told his close circle of advisers then mister trum posed a threats a democracy and should be prosecuted for his rolle in the events of january six according to two people familiar with his comments he also told confidance he want tat at turnng general meric garlan to stop acting a ponderous judge and to take decisive actions well that is weard that he then did those things and this a very much when brocabama said wouldn it be great of the irus would not be grigg if the irus whon after all my olitical oponents thou' be gregt thit is overt and then magically the iress did just that then people le did not order them to do it right when you say publically you want the people who work for you to do a thing typically they tend to do the thing if i were to suggest on my show that i want my tean to get me a birthday cake tomorrow for no reason i ssume somebody would probably hear that and maybe ell get birthda cake tomorrow youve in vitin in explicitly tell him by the way gos houn ne thebirthda cake but that is the that is the way that this sort of stuff works when te boss says a thing and he says it in public he subordinates ten to do the thing is it a coincidence that jobidon wanted these thingst happenin now they are magically happening is it also a coincidence that barocabama apparently told jobiden earlier the summer the donald trumps political strengths could actually be a problem for him and maybe maybe it might be kin an nice if something would happen to that fi rid a men if he just got hit with bunch men ditemens that atn'n ibapen that would not get terrible thing according to washington posed at the wunch help them late june at the wite house presients o boma promise to do all he could to help get the president reelected according to two people familiar with the meting but he also warned that donal trumps political strengths including intensely loyl following a trump fremly con cervet of media eko system in a polerized country under line his worry that trump could be a more formidable candidate than many democrat's realize i know what is a a great way to a undercut that opposition is by locking him up with munch of false legal charges that could in washington he see quite probably result in a convictiod no caoll from a fidera prosecutor he says thiswill almost certainly result in a conviction which again it is in washington he see yather's real go chot i frees feature i me trumce tefence thi n well id just set id i in actually do anything but that is never ear if fence to wig few it o y yeo do not order you to kill some one it o or yo on conspire with you to kill somewheeon through my words or it is o that that does not mean that i onces only speech there for i camp be prosecuteded that is thoroughly boges i thing were generally cacstes an ditment ere is straightforward ad narrow but poy packs a punch as ceen its calculated and i feel i it is almost certainly oint results in a conviction it is not clean it is not calculated its not pack a punch it is an op ad maska rating as an indictment but does not matters on washington to se tere's every possibility the donal trump could be convicted and and convicted in short order in washington dosee and terms os danger to trump again there get stack it up in sort of to categwories one is the actual solidity of the legal case in terms of the solidity of the legl cases that are currently outstanding against trump on the criminal basis by far the most grave charges of the classfi documents charges those ones there is pretty solid evience thet trump did the thing at's not with regard to the political concerns the bolitical concern of course is the double stand withthilery bits a whole different thing in terms up which charges re the most dangerous and troms the stuff that trump has violated the rankings go florta case dese indictment which again is specius and manhatton indictment which is superduper species in terms of actual danger to go to jail dese is by far number one by far number ones s its a washington desey jury and tat i's a huge difference in this case and democrats know it they want o jam him up this is it is rigging it when if if suddenly the rebunch of legal cases that arose against jo bidon just prior to the election in which he had to sit in the doc munch of deas decided to just try him month after month after month for bunch of specious charges yes that would be a form of election rigging in the same way s from a flection rigging when the federal government literally lie two people about whether hunter by ns labtop was real causing social medeos ensership of the neworpost story an the other messacere of course as i've said is the democratic message which is that donal trump is the worst person to ever person and a nancy polocy is trotting now went out it' she apparently she is heartbroken there is nothing i hate more than crocodiles here as this is crocodile tears just in extremus you have a singular experience of geinrsec on as youread the inditment what was your reaction an what jump down to you it is har braking for our country to ave e president of the night tat a wit this a lis the tagis against him and i justpan it cononed that a daniuellisin it irbron naty the halth committee by partitin committee thany tomsonin this tany in all the members of the committee in the stat for the work that they did they made a foundation of facts about facts and the law and made a criminal refero to the justice department im she seems very heartbroken does not she or maybe she superhaby this guests to be the narrative going forward and this leads us to our favorite thing two th hings can be true at once him a get to all the things tht cn me tra once in just one second first this show is supported by gran canyon university gran canyuvers ie visited it is a beautiful beautiful place it is an affordable private christian university with a vibrant campus in phoenix arizona its rank top

doctoral degree yofve supportfrom your own university councillor who h takes a personallize approach to helping you af chever gulls find your purpose at g c u gran canyon university private christian affortable vhisa g c u dot e t u to day aga now get to the two things com me tro once it can be true the democrates are trings rig the election in their own favor by it both elevating tonal trump in the primaries and also degrading him in the general with all these legal cases which achieve all of those things both for narrative purpose and for actural practical day to day time on target purposes for adonald trump at can also be true that donald trump made some of this bad himself an mean thereare lot ofpeople are very angry at my pence today can and anything that mi pence should hae come out strong against the inditmend i her again i think thathe shuld have i thin ye shul have said this indictment is species does not appear to to b legally pradicated but mi pence was also the gy who donald trump was lying about for three months two was the person who who donal trump was was basically directing all ier in the universe at his own vice president who been absolutely loyal to him for four years there wis no more loyal servant of donald trumps policy positions in the white house then my pence for four long years and ona time trump swiveled on him and just clocked him in the face repeatedly by line it was a lie that my pence had the unilateral ability to overturn the election it is not true just as comala harris as not have the unilateral ability to overturn the election and i'm constantly amazed by any one who gives any credence to this legal theory and there were people who ware doing it for several months i i cannot see any reason to do it other than for a a sort of nefarious purpose in in the sensce of a selphagrandizement because it was obviously legually species an and silly thice president does not have the capacity to simply put aside state certified votes if he did theould make him a dictator that is silly ca but no two things can be tro once trump pence should have said that the indictment is species and also donald trump ratically mistreted my pence there is no question about this and ma pence is not wrong to talk about that here is pence talking about that yesterday let us let us be clear on this por there was not just the ask for paus a the president ta specifically ask man his gaggol o va of crack po lawyers asked me the literally reject vots te which would have result to in ta in the issure being turned over to the house of re presentatives and literally caos wot ovin sur o martha just the people people canare the an di mann frankly ii sa before id hope that it not come to this poit ti i do not know if the government can me the standard the burdn o prove be od reasonable doubt a for crevital charges but the american people deserve to know a the president trop a at is advisers i did not just ask me to pas the ask me to reject pots return votes essentially to overturn the election do not be angra my pence ro don trumpted and i'm sorry you cn me angry my pence for again not coming out against the incectment strong but it is sown trump who made its bed with regard to my pence trum then tweeted out i feel badly for my pence who is attracting no crowds enthusiasm or loyalty from people who as a member of the trump administration should be loving him by the way it should be noted at this pointhad of all of the cabinet officials who served under donal trump a grantell of for have currently indorsehim he did not fight agains selection fraud which will now be easily able to prove they some most recent faconsitement and in formation which will have be made a vailable to us finally a really big deal the vp had power mi did not understand but after the election the rinos in dems changed law taking that power away a don trum talking about loyal ty wth regard to my penc is really pretty gruves this falls under the two things can be trol onceral don trump should be insited these are not crimes they are just very very very bad behavior and bad activity it can also be true that don trump erelied on advisers for some of the worst advisers in american history sidney paw is a couk she was a cuk the whole time everybody who is watching shouldhave said that she was a cuk the whole time we looked at her claims and we established on the show that here claims were cookery from basically thevere beginning get on rudy juliani on his legal team it turns out that rudy seems to be now unfortunately he went from being america's mare when he was a terrific mare of new york in american here on the afromaphro nine eleven and a pretty formidable presidential candidate th begining the two thousand aght race in to a man who appears to be a habitual drunk when there is it there is an outlet out that there there is a a lass yud out right now from a formeer assistant in which the former assistant accuses him of sexual harassmen andta and other and and other sore of sexual miss conduct and i'm skin she has tapes of juliani talking to her juliani again it is these arethepeople the trump had around him these are the best people to thinks can me tr at once on trump should not be indited and onl trump does not surround himself with the best people this a direct quote from rudy juliani's taplic can get ready with the bleeberguise shere we go he is talking too a a in assistant named nowell donefee a and tim she is apparently suing him again as i say right now in civil court and here is the transcript thata of a tape mister juliani come here big come here big 's your belong to me give them to me indiscernible i want to claim my i want to claim my i want to claim mi these are mi miss dunfy oh yah mister juliani these brest belong to me no on else can get near these hoo c ag i do not care of thei'r flirting or they give you business cards at these are mine you got it mis donfy yes mister juliani understand i'm very possessive i've gone easy on you mis donfy ito now mister juliani i've ben easy on you miss donfy you are pety tough huny mister juliani i've been easy on you give them to me these were the people that that donall trump surround himself with in the middle of the election cycle is that a good thing is that what you want in a candidate i just because two thing just because you are being prosecuted and persecuted by your political opponents does not mean that you are actually good at the thing wherethe you are not making obstacles to reself by hanging out with people rudi juliani for example whil rue juliani shows up four seasons gardening with hair die dripping down his face i di does it i's does that sound the mark of a good candidate again thotrump is lot of things i've got said before he is a genious for teloscoping the id of the republican base his a genius for it he can put his finger directly on the pulse of the republican base he feels what they feel and that is an extraordinary power also he has no discipline whatsoever he surrounds himself with the absolute worst people who who apparently are there just based on some sickafhantic level of personal loyalty to him and he is not immaticulous tool on behalf of his own position he is not if he were he would have done a better job in last jervius presidency which frankly was a disaster area the first three years ofhis presidency his can of personal foibles were not in any way really hampering the efficacy of his program the last year was a disasterhibs ween black lies matter coveit handling and all of this stuff i is cand of a disaster the question is is that the person and then put aside the electro record is that the person thet re publicans want anominate do you do you wish to be succored by democrats in to doing precise with tha thing thy would you to do which is tonominates onl trumse that can hit him with eighty three false inditements wif he now in the election lock him up and hit him with a media waves suggesting that he is a criminal and do you think that don trump is can be able to overcome all of those obstacles do thing that is that is likely is that the most plausible solution here or is a possible the best thing that could happen is for jobide not to be president any morse we can fix the problems can fix the problems and this brings us to the other candidates inside the republican race again rondosantus is still the solid number to there is no number three all the talk about anybody else rising inside the republican pulling just is non existent all the the e right now if you wish to see some one aside from donal trom nominated it is to santis or bust the real cr post expolling average has trump at fifty four and has to cantis dateen and is every one else below five per cent no one else is gaining steam no onelse o picking up traction not tim scot who stuck at three per cent nint if he hailey who stuck at four per cent not my pencs who stuck at four per cent not toe ve cromasuammi who stuck at five percent and certainly not the the inimitably absolutely magnetic dug bergham we have never heard of the te santis is final ly doing the thing that he needs to do which is he is aggressively finding people on the left to punch according to politico desantis has now agreed touldebate gavenusum on fox news which is good now newsum is very clever guoy dosants tbrili enough to prept for this this is the debate that really the country should have is whether we wish to be more florda or whether we wish to be more california hiave a personal stake in this debates as i literally move my family from california to florda and my company from california to florida and national the i'm fascinated by this i think that it would be the debate that actually is worth watching as opposed to yu now two old men screaming at each other about their personal corruption or a leged personal corruption this debate should be interesting according to politico the flor republican in californy democrate have repeatedly sparred over policies in thei respective states each representing one side of the idea logical spectrum theugh occupying different political perchase te santis is trailing trump for the republican presidential nomination newsom is basically running is a shadow candidate in case jobidon should fall over and a smack his smack his head on wednesdaye de sants togreed to th debate ie said tomy when and were in eigts o newsome told politico the governor was also in apparently the proposed debate dates are november eighth or november ten and a hanidy would be the sole monitor it should be a fascinating development it is something that de santsis obviously needs to do and he needs to show that he can be a better candidate a better weapon against the left than trump its that ii've been saing this for while it is not about which republican candidate can tear down trump because no republican candidate

conversation between deven archer and congressional investigators a cording it two fox news devon archer hunter bidon's form usiness parter told investigators that hunter use his quote very powerful name to quote ad value in pitching and securing forn business venturs archer said that hunter bidin quot would not be avert or avertly shay were gin to use might add for this instead archer said that he would use it to get leverage he said quot defensive leverage that the value is there in his wor the value that hunter bidon brought to it was having there was the theoretical was corporat governens but obviously given the brand that was large part o the valuy ot they wen they were't bringing in hunter biden a druggaddicted crack adictate horrid dicted derowi to do corporac governants that is not that is not exactly the person tht yu hey that gui who is a crack hound when we snorting parmishon cheese off the carpet lut's bring him in for corporact governants i sit on the board of a large privately held company tht would be dailywire i also sit on the board of a publicly held company anast that treti company and out lemme sellue we do not do corporat governants with crack atticts tht's not how it works ido not the as the sole value but i do thin it was a keep components of value said devon archer it was the sold hallut was not a keecop pone it what at what else is a value lic what is the value of of hunter bidon a cross is intior life what is the value of him they really name it name an productive thing that hunter bidon has done other than having a last name that is the same is that of a senator v p an than president archer told investigators that hunter put his father than v p trobidn on speakerphone well meaning wi business partners at least twenty times archer said that the id dea was to quotesell the brand he said that brought the most value to the brand it was hunter biden and him we would discuss havingyo know an understanding of de c and that was to diferentiating compone invest being able to raise capital he added it was not as specific as the vice president son but obviously the brand carried a's to say it in honest to got yourn't to say it wy gif dontrom junior walks into a room and he says iave connections would you think he saying he has connections to his literal name is don trom junior hunter bidon's literal name is hunter bidon when asked if archer and hunter would tell business partners theyad unique access because of ye be biden archer sa guest weud saiy we had yunique understanding of de c and how it operates and how that could positively reflect on the terms of our business referring to berisma archer told investigator's hunter used the brand of joe for having doors open which sent the rightes signals for briesman to carry on its business and be successful archer said my only thought as i thing barisman wouldhave gone out of business if he did not have the brand attached to it when pressed archer just kept repeating that he kept saying they re able to survive for his longas they did just because of the brand because people ould be intimitated to mess with tem archer explained in what way legally well that is interesting they felt that if they mst wit barisma legally that the brand would would come in when me spell that out they were afraid thatif they mest it barisma legally the vice president of the united states migt withold a billion dollars an aidsto get the prosecutor fired is that with hey were afrait of the brand interesting and meanwhile ov an archr did not interview with tunkar carlson in which he openly said selling access to joe was it certainly in abuse of sof power i guess i'm piviting against the lie that i'm hearing people tell with a straight face congersman goldman for example thoroughly no what was going really you are taken a call from the vice present and put on spiakers not tus hay that i'm in meeting with somebody is why it is letmit let me put my dad te sathe u spinker in in the rear view it is a it is a it is an abuse of soff power it isa an abuse of soff power i'm interesting i'm it 's certainly in abuse of soft power and then tunke reveals a letter thae jo by nactually sent even archer thanking him for just being best ease with test ese with his son i hope you enjoyed lunch thanks for coming sincerely jusephor bodon junior ps hand written happy you guyse are together they are many levels here but here is the vice presen the united states saying to you a man in his mid thirty's whoas not a government official i'm sorry i was occupied with the guy runs the world's larch's country i would much rather talk to and thank you and he was thanking me and thanking hunter i think that the endof tdhey for bringing this idea of this government regulatories tesi ad visery businesiness of the private equity world and i think he was excited about the prospects for hunter and a now he was a just just thanking nothing was a nice gestur but he is a vice presn the united state u and he is talking about foreign business deals with you and thanking you frari think i e it goes bykt my other earlier point in in i think i it the time i thin tat the jack pot in finding the regulatory an vire man er company that can navig ga right to the ta but in obviously as times told in a being a little bit too close the son and e burning i ay i'm at this point i think that we can point out that there will be a fall back defense because the efence that joe did not know what was going on is out is obviously lie that the idea that joe's not involves in any way with his sons businesses is obviously lie all allthese things are clearly lies worganan gets the final the final defence hers can be joe of course ter did he had to hunter was dearelect hunter was a beautiful boy going through a rough time a wonderful artist in his soul who is stupping his a brother's widow among other women well doing crac and trafficing and all that a wonderful and and joe loves his because he loves family joe's a family men there is one final obstacle t at to fend to and that was the fact that he was ignoring a for yor old girl who actually is genetically his granddaughter i's a hu's ignoring her and now they have decided that the real reason he was ignoring her is cause he loves his family too much too much that is also why you ignor members of your famil you love them too much according to envy sey news in recent weeks presiden jo bidon realized his silence was no longer tennabal that it was time for him to publically recognized his for yer old granddaughter caught up in a bitter child supportcases involving his son hunter people familiar witht matter seid u before he could do he wanted to take one final step getting the green light from his son which he received last week one sor said and on friday bidon finally spoke out about his seventh grandchil to him for years he would not much as acknowledge in public now the president wants to meet little mavy jone robert's of arkenton and tospell the notion that he was ignoring a vulnerable member of the bidn family tree tat is that the root of his political identity according tothe people familiar witht matter he wants to mether ye when up he is in a meat navy jone a proximately the time that he visieas palistine ohio or the border a those the the same trep probaly he he isin what eas palestine visit the trained arelment membery's gan do that and never habit yet navy jone che ches to me a frequent white house gased never family dramas typically play out in private theg rarely when the first nations for families involved the president was wrapped himself in family throughout his queer is now in an improbable twist having to explain why he publicaly ghoested a young girl who as as much as grandchilds any of the others whose high school graduations he attends or who playfully call him pop publicly claiming navy jone is a member of his family may all fer bidina measure of peace politically however it also serves to blunds a jeopi line of a taknat does not not does not it is obvious that he was ignoring his granddaughter because he does not care about that granddaughter at iesn't car about the granddaughter because hunter clears the checks for him the white house to cline to comment on any of the family development including whether bidon wants to met his granddaughter in person instead a white house ha'd referred the to friday statement a called the issue a private family matter that is weerd that is private family matter i gan i love that the're ow claiming privacy no one knows any of bidons other grand children other than navy jones specifically becaue he does not ignore ang of is other grand children its not a story jobidon is a bad man the very vulnerable candidate republicans have an opportunity to run against that vulnerable cansidete an it is particularly true because i am not sold on the idea that the economy is in solid state i know that everybody in the media are already turning eagerly the idea that the economy is going to be just fong and there will be no recession i have some doubts ive that whwellse has doubts as it turns out the fitch credit rating service remember by nomics it is amazing by nomic by nomic means that done fitch ratings is now down grated the us governments credit rating weeks after president bidon and congressional republicans came to the brink of the historic defall warning about the growing debtburden and political disfunction in washington well one way to solve the det burnon is to is to stop spending seven trillion dollars a year but the bide wite has ling now fitch just got a wrong that is probly what it is fitch got a wrong now ou mind you that when moody's down grated israel's credite a few weeks ago in the aftrmath of judicial reform in israel the entire media sihted this is evidence that israel's economyesabout the collapse it as not yet collapsed when fitch downgrates americas credit rating because we are spending wlychto much money and we will never catch up then it must be that fitch is wrong here is jard burnsteen on the white house counsel the conomic advisers when pturbo era ta atord cela do you araration toaaaoaan a a tereaaraaer fao i you rea oooa aoeran stanooar peoplaao r tran teo o ano ar bedar for ma well ther there is only one problem of this which is that america owes wa we wa to much money and that is just a reality and nobody is going to take this on at all the fact is again because we have jack top our interestrates that means that the interest paymente that we are taking on our new debt is going to be extraordinarily hon the amount of money were gan have to dedicate to paying off oliv our creditors for decades to com is extraordinary net interest is going to reach seven hundred forty five billion dollars in the twenty twenty four fiscal year that it is three quarters of all discretionary spending excluding defense in the united states that just the interest on our debt and it is only going to get larger again the fact is that as a share of g d p the projection of youust that is a share of grows domesticcrodict continues to rise absolutely astonishingly and dramatically which is one reason why you are string to see credit downgratesthat is con continues long as the programm of the united states is to spend more and more and more money th bid administration their plan is denial an the strategy of the bind administration is to pretend that that does not matter as always ganit yelling proud feat shea she says that done it is puzzling to get this credit down grate anta this administration deeply cares about fiscal responsibility which is a strange because people who care byt fiscal responsibility do not spend seven trillian dollars the year the lonkerterm the united statremainsthe worlds largest most tinamic an most inifativ economy with hi strongesfinantial sistem in the world it jis disicion is pistling an lihtedthe economic strenth wit sy in the united states i strongly disecre with fitiostisition and i belief id isentirely unwarranted fiscal responabilityis priority for prised inbidon in me earlier this year the prised inseing det limit legislation theincluded oritrilion dollars in deficet reduction is poicer would also inpruvetiscal outlook by redusing defise by to poinsixtrilion dollars ofie nexten years ofm yat right the're gong to reduce the deftsit guys by that by by that they mean that they are going to supposedly spend less mony over what we actually are paying then they did previously not there can reduce dat that that is not a thing that is going to happen by the way the the economy's still on tender hooks here because as the walstergunal points out earnings season is still coming we are gon to find out nor how the earnings of these companies are on to do and will e hw that am pass the stok market while stocks of climb corfert profits o fallen according to walster jounal companyes in the ascipy five hundred are set to log at roughly seven per cent year ovor youars ecline in earnings for the second quarter which again it is hard to see how these stock market keeps increasing while earnings are going down we are also going to see the jobs market that is cooling pretty rapidly youmust employers added about two hundred thousan cjobsin june thatis the smallst monthly payrill gain since late twenty twenty the julian plenmet report is coming out this friday wage growth has slowed as well and we are seeing your in your job opening again what what goes up must come down the economy went up wade too fast an trms of just the heat and i it is going to come down a i i i have very little faith that the bide eministration has somehow avoided the pitfalls of reality o kay time for a quick thing i and then we will do a few things that i hate things at that i to day i enjoy when people who do not have leverage sometimes believe they have leverage it is kind of funny for example rachel's igler is not actress now there are many many many actresses every berestot in in lost angelists is not actress rachel's igler is an actress who is on broadway there are many many many people who tra for broadway and wheare quite talented it turns out in country three or forty million people that re lot of talented people who are actors actresses singers but rachel's igler believes that che has leverage ouven thou again no one truthlly in hollywood no one has the capacity to open a move any more idoes no one does then the number of stars were can open a movi in america that is down to basically crissprat no one o but tom cruws crisprat that is the entireless you knows not on thalist as rachel's ggler rechell's uggler howeveris part ofthe acter strike and she says that dom becaught she she essentially promotes the labor thury of value when it comes to acting here a ya this is this is not going to be how this this labor strike gat solved o a a ou i ot a a a w at r o ih well the you coan negosha than your contract but dit you are not i noticed what she saying there is that because she is standing there i distney dress she should get paid for every hour that sno white and the non wethat let tena sno white and the non dwarf dwarfs o various divers backgrounds in sextual lrantations for every hour that is that imn the badness for hers tat's con to get streamed for two hours it is not it is ton can be amazing but even put that aside that is not how market's war thay did she take the actual risk is she in putting the capital into the making of that film ere eu she getting paid a salary in order to do that film a pretty lucrative salary i would imagin she couldn negotiate for a point right there ther actres whave done that past gon very rich doing that du she have the market power to do that the answers of course nothings o go down thestreet an and hire somebody else a good luck to her in her in her leverage play that is not how business work ca time for a couple of things at that i hate there is some people today who are laughing and celebrating at the separation between just intrudo and his wife first ali dono know that you was married to lady but in any case just in trudo that is bablonbyjoe by the waso credits of bablim in any case just in trudo who ise for sure not fidell castro son in any case se and his wife sophy said to wednesday they have separated after eighteen years of marriage the way that they announce this is on their respective instrogram accounts which was theway the most honorable people do this thing when you have three kids s you god your instrogram accounts and thn you let the world know tha youon't each other any more sophy and i would to share the fact thafter many meaningful and difficult conversations we have made the decision to separate justintrudo said on instrogram then they both asked for privacy a supper statemen from the couple said they have signed a legal separation agreement they remin of close family and sophy an th prim minister our focust on raising thir kids in a safe loving and collaborative en vironment both parent will be a constant presence in their children's lives and canadians can expect to often see the family together i'm sure the canadians will be absolutely thrilled they have two boys fifteen and nine and fourteenyourl daughter congratulations to them on no helping to completely script their kids life eveen worse than it is screwed up being public figures the two met in june twill not two thousand three to charity galla just in trudoand his memar said they chatted and flirted for much of the evening that they went on a dinner date and the he said i felt to giddy sense that sophy 'd be the last woman i ever dated and at lasted untila intelligent they were married in motrio in made two thousand five she apparently worked is a t g host houd can answer tanem en correspondent in cabec she said in march two thousand fifteen i can tel you readway no arriage is easy i'm almost kind of proud of the fact that we have had hardship because we want aff enticity we want truth i ththe reason i put the some things i hate is because again the bekind of no one shouldever revel in somebody else's divorc when ther kids because it is screws up kids incredibly badly the kind of soft peddling of the effects of divorce on children in our society is astonishing and what is amazing is that it is become wrote if you' ba to the the late nineteen seventies before no fault divorce became a a sort of common place aspect of american life and you watch a moveou cramer verses cramen which trocks about theffects of divorce on children divorce is devastating kids it is devastating it rocks the world that destroys ther world it it it destroys whatever feeling of safety they have in prictability they have it takes one of their parents out of the house and it is terrific the fact that these people on married for eighteen years of society to divorce while their kids our still the youngest is nine that is it that is a disaster aria it really really is and this is why you doft barring ther're their reasons to divorce abuse she dang ither ther the're real reasons tivorce but if none of that is happening asous people i do not feel living with yo any more ah you are you are doing the wrong thing you are kids come first that is that is really quite bad o kan a couple more things i hte to apparently mea colifa who is a former plorin star who as now become some sort of social media star she is giving marital advice i've a general rule i do not take marriage advice from people who have stoped half the human population just tat just a general rule and i'm shea here heres me a colifa giving marital advice she is also by the way a rabbit anti sit min hear rego o were comparing tats papy girl does not know that i am tom brady at this game married at eighteen divorce at twenty one second marriage married at twenty five divorce a twenty eight thirtin gage met engaged at twenty nine ended it at thirty but i kept the ring i'm still keeping tom brady on his toes we should not be afraid to leave these men we are not stuck with thess people marriage its not a sanctimonious thing tis itis paper work it is something it is it is it is a commetment you make to some one but if you feel you are not getting anything from that commentment and you are trying you got a go you have got a go you have to go i know it is difficult to fell out paper work and to make appointments into do all of these things but this is your falking life do you want to be stuck with some one it i period that is terrible marital advice also it is not what the word sanctimonious means in in the words of manupotinkin i do not think that word means what what you think it means i think what choose going for was there is no sanctity to marriage which is a hell of a tatement considering that literally it is the most sanctified institution it is the institution with the most most sanctity in human history but to hurris just pece papers i've a question why sime a peace paper at all i get getting marital advice from a lady who just regial list of her marriages this is somebody given you financial avice after going bankrupt t eight times well paying off your dats is thentleme you half to do i m you senan documents hang their spost to pafrudets bot there is bankrupse white white committing two paying off your dabts man meanteus to bes of paper you onsh goto quart and cler bankrup see what is the problem i'll kae gentleman staye far far away from this human because this is not a person that you want to be in relationship with i' silov ya it just means it isto commitment a commitment i can violat whenever i please and leave which is not what we call a commitment is genius level stuff there froma again a a wise wise human i'l get final thing that i hate to a this one is actually quite important we now have actual open evidencethat the bidin white house ask face book to degrade the traffic of daily wire my company according to just the news an john solomon the memmos suggest that the bitdon white house inquired in meetings with facebook executives asking whether facebook could tweget to algri them to show case stories from the york times an whalster journal over content posted by quook polorising conservat to journalists and commentators in early twenty twenty one the memmos reviewed by just the news chronicl a series of meetings between the whitehouse digunal direct or rob flarity and executives from face book now known as metta in spring two thousand twenty one as the first questions about the efficacy and safety of the covinineteen vaxine becan surging on social metium the memos delivered recently undersipinuts the houshuti shery committe make clear the white house was actively interacting with fae book and sometimes presuring the social medeo gint to moderate contents in a way that would encourage more americans to get inoculations on april fourteen two thousand twenty one for instance the white house's flarity asked face book whether it could promote than york times and whalster journal over the daily wire flarty ask facebook and please quot if you re to change to the algrithem s that people were more likely to see n york times whalster journal any authoritative new source over daily wire tommy lar an pullerizing peoplek you wouln't have a mecanism to check e maturea im pact daily wire of course we are we are a sighte that filed a landmark walstut challenging the osha vax at mandate under jobiden ar we are the only major company in the united states on the right to actually file a lawsuit against the osha of ax mantet while other major media american companies on the right were actively fourcing their empolice to get the shot we were suing the federal government to stop it we are not afraid to sue the federal government again we are not afraid to sue the bidon white house mn firstwhile there my be criminal violations right here flarity is cited in the notes is t asking the question cose candidly there is not a lot of trustord face book and the biton whitehouse wantd to know whether the latform was qoot finding things tat are effective that you are not doing to combat resistance to vaxines in terms of interventions know tha there are roups that are hotspots admens have to approve post if violating conson prove gives the roup of strike i'm oncovering new examples on comments public figures on comments might be contributing more the notes quote the facebook executives as saying tope we are absolutely pleased to look into the effects on our business of the bidon white house engaging in absolute first o men in violation there is no questions the irst men violation it is as simple as that it is a first man violation because the federal goernment cannot force or even pressure a private company into censering information that is a first amendment violation pretty clearly and as my frend and wayr kr chlictor says it is a criminal violation governmen officials were tempting to use government powers suppress the civil rights of american citizens me that that is right maybe there w'll be a criminal intitement here maybe there should be certainly we are examining all of our legal options of this plant we have no hesitency whatsoever about going about the going at the biden in white house again we did before wi'll do it again it casts us millions of collars to got for th osh of act mandate we helped overturn the thing and prevent eighty million americans from having to take the shot if itden't want to take it we are perfectly happy to do the exactingthing with th bid an white house right now to stop them from ever violating the civil rights of americans by pressuring face book and and other social media companies again and by the way we have looked at the traffic on our website and whether it declines in the aftermouth of this conversation suffice it to say evidence we will be presented this is it is an astonishing story it truly is

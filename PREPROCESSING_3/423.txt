welcome to the ubermanlasciencescience pace to ri mindur huberman and om r professor of nerbiology and opthomology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is jeff cavalier jeff cavalier holds a master of science and physical therapy and is a certified strainth and conditioning s pectiualist he did his training at the university of connecticut stores one of the topfive programs in the world in physical therapy and sports medicine i discovered jeff cavalier over ten years ago from his online content his online content includes information about how to train for strength how to train for hyperthiphy which is muscle growth how to train for eindurance as well as how to rehabilitate injuries to avoid muscular in balances nutrician and supplementation i've always found his content to be incredibly science paced incredibly clear sometimes surprising and always incredibly actionable it is therefore not surprising that he has one of the largest online platforms for fitness nutritian supplementation and injury rehabilitation jeff has also worked with an enormous number of professional athletes and has served as head physical therapists and assistants straincoach for the new york mets again the content that jeff cavalier has posted on line has been immensely useful to me over the years that i was absolutely thrilled to get the chance to sit down with him and ask him about everything from how to train in terms of how to split up the body parts that you train across the week how to integrate strainth training and endurance training when to stretch how to stretch indeed we talked about nutritian we talk of it about supplementation we talk about how to really avoid creating in balances in muscle and in nurl control over muscle one thing that is rally wonderful about jeff as he really has an understanding of nachus how muscles and bones and tendons and ligaments workd together but how the nervous system interfaces with those we talked abut the mental side of training including when to bring specific concentration to the muscles that your training and when to think more about how to move weights through space and think more about the movements over all i'm certain that you will find the conversation that we held to be immensely useful and informative for your fitness practices and also for how you mentally approach fitness in general and how to set up a lifelong fitness practise one that will give you the strength that you desire one that will give you the aesthetic results that you desire one that will set you up for endurance and cardyofvascular health basely an overall fitness program i really feel this is where jeff cavalier shines above and beyond many of the other pieties and fitness called influencers that are out there again everything is grounded in science everything is clear and everything is actionable and while we do cover an enormous amount of information during to day's episode if you want to dive even deeper into that information you can go to atley next stot com where you will find some of jeff's programs you can also find him at athley next on you tobe there you will find vidios for instance how to re air or heel from lower back pain something that i actually followed directly long before i ever met cet has over thirty two million views and that is not by accident is because the protocals there again are surprising and actionable they relieved my backpain very quickly without surgery someimmensely grateful for that content and it extends into everything from again hypertrophry endurance and straith training and on again it is athly next stok calm as the websie athley nects on ou tube and also athly necks on instugram the huberman ladpodcast is proud to announce that we have partnered with momentous supplements weu done that for several reasons first of all the quality of their supplements is exceedingly hih second of all we wantod ave a location where you could find all of the supplements discussed on the hubermen lad podcast in one easy define place you can now find that place at livemomentous dok calm slash hubermen in addition momentous supplements ship internationally something that a lot of other supplement company simply do not do that is terrific whether not you live in the us or you live abroad right now not all of the supplements that we discussed on the hubermn ladpodcast are listed but that catalogue of supplements is being expanded very rapidly and a good number of them that we have talked about some of the more prominent ones for sleep and focus and other aspects of mental and physical health are already there again you can find them at libomentousto calm slash hubermen before we begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desiron effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and sines related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponser is athletic greens letic greens is an all in one vitemen mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve son delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athleti greens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all f my basic nutricional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which our vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called gup microbiom and the ways in which the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essetialy with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without leti greens tit get the vitemens i need the minerals i need and the probics to support my microbiom if you to triathletic greens you can go to athletic green stok com slash hubermen and claim a special offer the will give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemen d three k too there are ton of datad now showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitemen d three and k two is also important because it regulates things cartovascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstock com slash hubermen to claim the special offer of the fie free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and n thing you do not that means the exact ratioes of electrolites are an element and those are sodium magnesium and patassium but it has no sugar i've talke many times before on this pod cast about the key roll of hydration and electrolites for nerve sell function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodiu magnesium and potassium present in the proparatios all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolites are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormon systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that you are getting the proparatioes of electrolites if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is eleement e dot calm slash huberment and you'l get a free element sample pack with your purchase they are all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element e dot calm slash huberman and now for my discussion with jeff cavalier jeff such a pleasure for me to have you here i'm glad to be heris amazing ive a long time consumer of your content i've learned a tremendous amount about fitness both in the waiht room cardio mutrician things that i've applied for over a decade for me this is particularly meaning full and my golier is really to ask a bunch of questions to which i'm interested in the answers but also of which i know the audience is really curious about one of your montras is a if you want to look an athlet train an athlete and i think that is something really spessial that sets aside what you do from what a lot of other very well qualified people do and in terms of the use of waits and resistance whether nod's body waight or waits in the gim or poles verseis cardio in terms of overall health aesthetics and ahleticism is there a way that you could point to the idea that maybe people should be doing your fifty per cent resistance training on fifty per cent cardiow maybe it seventy thirty maybe it is thirty seventy and and here on talking about the typical person who would to maintain or maybeven add some muscle mass noably in particular areas for most people as bas just overall mass al thet will talk about that later and people want to maintain a relatively low body fat percentage and bein good cardyo of ascular health what is the sort of contour of a basic programme that anybody could think about as a starting place o iivags leke a sixty forty split which would be leaning toars a way training o strengthen in in the and then either the conditioning aspect the above forty per cent if you look at over a course of a training wek anin five days in the gim would be a great passing avasing in the gim it could e done at home but three days train training on dy ents a friday conditioning to day theres i ya two days it is it it is a pretty easy round about way to split that up of course depending upon training goals and as you said the esthetic goals thot will shift dramatically but if you wanted to see the benefits of both that is probably the the effect of dose for strain training and the effect of those for conditioning at the bearmenl level again being of much better performer condition wise can wone to more than that and in terms of the duration of those work out what is your suggestion i i've been waigt training for about thirty years running for about thirty years and mainly for health and have found that if i work hard in the jam er at resistance training for more than sixty minutes or very hard for me to recover istrar geting coalds i st are getting weaker from work out to work out but amazingly at least to me if i keep those work outs to about ten mintes ten minutes of warm up and fifty fives zro minutes wor of really hard work for resistance training and i keep the carty voscular work about thirty to forty five minutes i feel great and i seem to make some progress at least some place in work out from work out to work out i mean it is does her good numbers cause those ha cind numbers that we usually preach we try to keep our work outs to an hour or less if possible nout depenning upon the split that you are following if you are an a total bodys split there is just can be more that has to be done in a given amout time i'm that a are not again if you training primarily for straingth that could prolong the work out as along the rest times and between sets but in general when you are not folcast on that one aspect wut the over all health picture them you can get the job done in and under an under an hour and again i always say on top of it if you want to look n aply train an apply is you can either training longer you coul train harvage cannot do both and i really believe that the folk is for me i have a busy life i've lot other things that i do believe or not in it is i i want to go hard and i want go get out and i find that my body also response to that in thing a lotogis bod as respond to that and particularly as you start to get older i think it is the it is the length of the work out that actually causes more problems than the intensity of what you are doing particularly if you are warmed oup properly you said i've found personally that my warm up has had to become morbit inegral part o my my work out than it ever has before i never i can get in the gin when i was twenty and i'm going to right over a'm doing once set two sets othem and i'm ready to go and i never do another work out warm upset for any the other exercise of you the rest of day i'm that is not that is not sure any more and i've found that as long as i'm willing to sort of give myself a little o warm up the intensityes not whatl bothers me yet ii'm very much in control of the weights i use an it does not bother me but if i start to go pretty long i start to feel eighy orre sor to have probs again depnding upon age thats also place a factor in the length but again i think everybody can achieve on a standard programm conachieve the results that they want within an hour terms of splits you mention split and for those who ren't familiar with this a term splits its really a which body parts are you training on which days seems a do not almost everybody follows a weekly work out schaduel th ody of course does not mot ver ri a w week i do no resonthing that once every seven or tis every seven days makes sunse physiologically as tus the body does not worth them but that isthe way life is structured a i've seen you disguss three days a week whole body work outs ai've heard of splits a pushing one day a pulling another day legs another day a day off repeat om there many variations on thess what are some general themes tat we can throw out their and in order to avoid the the huge matricks of possibles youse of wonderful contect that points us and we will cap but in our caption show notes will link out to some of those theyt a different ways to design splits but in terms of giving people a logic ave had a think about spliting up body parts what is governing the the split what wourd of the rules in the logic that dictate a split for me the first ruleis will you stick to it it if you cause there are split i do not i do not particularly full body splits was actually talking to just hy about that theother daylike i do not necessarily to have to train everything now of course the viums will come down pur muscle group but if you do not to do that and you actually do not look for to your work out because you are dreading having to do everything and feeling may be too fatigued by the time your work outs over or the fact that those gentlly dou take a little bit longer and do not finto your schedul i do not care how effect of the split is a split not done is not effective you need to find one that fit maye you go in to and a'll turn aboption a am a pushpul legs thake you mentioned and that can be done either one cycle through the week onon monday once they friday split or could be twice in a weeks ser actually training six times youre were you repeat it yount pull push legs pull push legs or er yo a tehowever you on't do ithit with either a day off and between the three days or at the end of six days a and again that actually impacts your schedul ive broken that down beforwars n if you put it in between the three days is good becaus you are giving yourself an nextra rest day and between but it starts to shift that day off every week as we wrap arounds for those gies that were choosing that seven days cedual out of convenience in our heads it starts the mess wit that off tay others to just keep your predictibly let down a sunday an train six days in a row a but that is hat but that is a a better way tho maybe group similar muscle actions together which i think i i deftally prefer that because if i'm going to be training i pulling movements at least thet there is a centergy between them and i feel a looking to a cheef one goall that day a and thend i mean quite oneusly you go back to the bro split days and they's though still work effect there is a reason why they work in the past i i think that science shows that there smarter ways to do them these days you can you can come back and hid a related muscle you could do let us thay biceps on on day and then come back two days later and yo back realizing again senergy between the the exerciseos ther your bicis forn youvere stimulated again you could figure out ways to make that work but the thing thai think is is effect of there is that tends to be one ofthet ones of people the most because they can go in to get their pump they feel good that it is it is pretty solely focust on ble muscle group is that o definition of a bro split one os a group that yis he sais very much geare toward strength an esthetics really mack somising ye chestpo day i'll be more more aesthetics than stram ye yt your densy the brow r the brona the evidently i gand you kow in here i am a sience guy and i i could appreciate the benefits of a brosplit especially cas again licequet to what to what end you who whose whose go we are wetrying to achieve here there is er r ourst i mean if if i'm applying my standards an my gulls or even athletic ideals but they just want to get in shape then it is perfectly fine to to do it to do a bro split in that instance if you are sticking to it again and your seeing the results whic you want to see from it but they are able to you do not really keep their focas on one mustle they get to focus on lik ilicalots have people struggle with the the way of aan exercise feels until their second or third set but they do not have that proprceptif ability o can o lock in o an exercise spending a few now i set them the same yo exercise but then doing another excise on say mustle group helps in the dialand a little the better and get more ather training yet that reason really interesting i thing important question early on when i started a resistance train which was announce sixteen high school i gotin touch with and i was learning from mikemencer i meeli thou o do tinters atters in and mike was very helpful a very very helpful we got to be friendly a li just read his book i a ge ganst the i of jealous ar n i back then knowing or nat i you mig paid my western union tipe thing to tos send him some money for the back of myand then he got on the phone with me and and my mother of the time was wisest grown man an the house and he gave me a a very straight for ard split which was shoulder's arms one day he had be taking two days off and then training legs and n two days off and then chestamack et cetera and then tha that is a variation of brosplit to where your sort of yeo breaking them down that way chest an back or chest e bise ye ihe worked very well for me i probablywould because of my age i think an give therewas the i was untrained i think it largely on train i thing would hav a grown on on many different programms but it worked very well for me i eventually just as i made that in every other daythings ors arms day off legs day or two off as we it legs right least for me i'm not training ta and then not doing much of anythan athletic the next day and chestback in repeat and sawn and the reason i found that helpfuls i almost always recovered between workouts am the te six day a week programm of push pul legs push uple legs to me am seems excruciating a'm from two standpoints one is at least with my recovery abilities lack of recovery billies i cannot imagin coming back feeling fresh the other one is if i if i'm in the gim more than four days a week i really start to fatigue it about the whole psychological experience of it whereas if i'm in ther three or four days a week in others if i put a day off in between each work out i really want to be there and i get in there with with a lot of fire am animals ore doing other things on the off days i think that i love that you mention tha the split it you will stick to and that you can bring the intensity to because i think o that truly important i sometimes here about two a day training i've done to a day training twice in my lifetime both times i got sick two days later that correlation not causation but am is there ever an instance were two a day weight training make sense for the non druggisis did am typical recoveryability person i actually i i think it make sense in some cenarios but it does not make sense practically to lot people schedul if you could break down let say you were going to do even a a o you a o some version of of a total body session or may be you are oing to do a an upper lower split i you could do an upper work out and do the anter chain of the pushing portion of that in one session and then come back in do the pulling session later on at night if you had the opportunity to the thing that you benefit from there is the freshness of focus again something in my head sact is sacrifice but a time you get towards the latter half of whatever work out your in the same point you may before when you start to a proch that fifty minutes an hour you mark you are either losing focus you are losing energy you are losing contract billability ore losing something and if you are relegating whatever it is the pulling portion of that to the end of that work out something suffer that ocan that if teu realize at's happening that may be you switch em up the next time you do the work out where the pulling portion of the upper work out goes first and then the pushing goes later your least not just continuing that cycle but at the same time if you were able to con split them up you get a chance to con to take a break you can have that freshmens of focus again and you can as hou get a better effort and cse again i think effort drives tho results if the effort is not compromise than you should be able to do that but systhemically is that problem and i think that it is a problem for lot o peopleis is hard to 's har to red the engion up a lot of times deling the day you now you warm that thing up once as that car in the winter you get a going once your lucky you can nay i drive it the rest of the day but f you put in the garra and try t start the next day it it is it is a problem ou know young people can get away the lot more than than older people could i've never had a strong recovery quotion but if i stick to this one day off in between every once in a while two days in row training may be because i have to travel when i want to make sure i get all the work ouse in conthing i seem to be oqt i your example of war ming up the car spoken a true east coast a eeast cost of those of us from the west co er i we e you fokt om th neast caus in the mid ow us get it and certainly from from europe in terms of the mixing up of cardio vascular training and resistance training a same day different day which one should come first which one l come second if one main goals again everyone listening has different goals ar most peopled either maintain or gain some muscle i doft know many people that want to lose muscle maintain or gain some muscle usually in specific locations on their body most people would to be a bit leaner or lot leaner therre few people out there thatre either naturally lean or do not want or acthy just want a gainwaight but assuming that people ne t get lean or put on some muscle r maintained muscle and want to have a healthy heart and a healthy brain which basy requires a health he cardy ofascular system how would you in corporate cardy of ascular work into the over all weekly regiment a again i i think that the yon the barramenmumis probably twice a week in terms of card of vascular if you want to have some semblance of cart of ascular condition but i think most people who actually need it more or want tof pursue it more than that a're got to need more time to do that a at some point it cannot just be relegated to a day off or a day off from the from the waight training work ous at some point it has to occur on the same day in in that case i just to put it if that is you are not your primary gull whith youe looking more for the just the over all picture of the aesthetics yo mention putting muscle on in certain aireas than i would put it at the end of the work out cause you do not want anany way compromise the waigt training work work out and as we have sort of referenceicable times already t the intensity of those work ous is important and we know there is a strength component to those work outs also that is going to you'l at be a healpful stimulus for grove the conditioning the cardio thats of done prior to any training as tre training work ot is likely going to imperier billy to perform at your best unless it is just on for a quick little warm up in the beginning but then it is not sustained long enough really to be of benefit for cart of ascular conditioning i just you will put that atat the end realizin that even if my effort level is lower my output is lower if it is still placing a demand o my cardac ou'tput to get that condition n of fact because i'm fatigued is still has that the mand of my cardac output still achieving its goal but it didn'interfere with my mangle of being able to increase my peforms in the gim ot it and intervers of the form of cardy ofascular training i've seen you am do a number of i have to say a very impressive a high intensy interval type work burby type work or push oups with with crunches mixed into the mand when people consee our vidios to did not describe those in the best way but rather than on the tread mill or out jogging for thirty forty five minutes is that because you prefer higher intensity a higher heart rate type am training ors it because you live in cold connectic it am and you do not want be out jogging on the roads in the middle winter a wet i think all the above i men those or factors yen from personal level but i think that if if you are iif we could bland function across these rounds and not have such a delineation between this is my way training and this is my conditioning but figure out a way to to blend them together i always think that you have get you have got a better opportunity get that more well rounded result and i the kind of mix up that straight condition in work and also some of the footwork te drills tan we havet we we have some high expectations for guodes to come ito our programs to just do some footwork drills they latter sle ladters or er line drills or something and you what happens people become intrigued and interested i never i'ven't tried thi since a high school and they become interested in just the challenge of it and as we become almost distracted by the challenge we are now finding our selves conditioning and i always think that is an important part that sometimes you got a draw people in am to get to show them what they might be interested in and from the outputter the effect of it i just think that we you are able to blend some ot somebody of still maintain somela that strength training into the exercise ss you men sho let seme do some kine of a push up or orp y i mean there is there is a aan anarobe component to that that is going to be helpful a that than rather than just walking or just jogging am not us not to say that that is not an effective means for strict cardyac conditioning it is a s one of the ways that we have had for y senturies to do it but i just think that if we can blend it than it becomes may be a bit more interesting and you get some of those cross over benefits and does not become segmented in terms of what we are trying to do i love the idea of bringing some mental challenge and some desire to improve a skill while conditioning that is not something that av thought of before in it and it is simply cause i've overlooked it ut make sense beis my sister whos reasonably fit althoug always trying to get her to do a bit more am sheays ask me of what should i take and i i do not believer in supplements some for certain people un certain instances but i keep telling her you noites it behaviors are going to and mytrition are cant have the greatest outsie pausife effact and she loves things am dance classes and things at am wor take boxing these hounds things which make sense that if you can hook somebody on the conditioning aspect of the skill aspect in cont trick them into doing more cardio to speak that that is terrific also the narrow scientist in me just has to say forgive me am that any time you are engaging the of the i you sets of motor nrouns once in your brain the upper motor ouns in the onces in your spon on court any time you'r engaging those upper motorner ons which are for deliberate a well controlled action you are doing a great thing for your brain intfroms to brain long gevity am i'm now i need to incorporates some actural skills in my training a going back to wait training a bit one of the most important things i learned from you s over the years was that when training to increase muscle size to really think not much about moving weights but more about challenging muscles ye i also heard this from am my friend ben pockolsky who is very well complish i he was a bodybuilder now he is in to other aspects of fitness teach is fitness but do not move weight challenge muscles unless you aren't trying to power left or something that sort which i'm not immensely helpful but the other thing that i learned from you that i a combine with that was this idea that certain muscles will grow better and get stronger much more easily maybe even will recover better becaus of our ability to contract them really hard and this i what i call the cavalier test which is of at least if if i could paraphrase the for instance if i can it is always the bysed isnt let us eus let us use the calf for the bisep if you can if you can flex your bicep to the point where it hurts a little bit i almost feels a cramp or a cramp re conflex your calf to the point where it really cramps up a loof it almost feels its nodding up that is a pretty good indication that you are going to be able to stimulate that muscle well under load if you are doing the movement properly and that is the feeling tishe aim for each repetition may even throughout the repetition for me this completely transformed my results this was i think it may be five six years ago that i first heard this from you body parts that for me lagged behind that i thought maybe genetically worn'k in a word for me immediately just started growing i right and i was getting stronger and stronger i though this is really something much that i've dedicated a portion of my research along in collaboration with another group to try and understand what is happening in these upper motor rons in the brain that can engage the muscles even more and that it is not just about progressive overload or putting a pump into the muscle that it is really this mine muscle connection is a real thing when it comes to predicting results and that you can get better at it a forgive me for paraphrasing ut you are incredible content around this it made a tremendous difference for me and a number of other people that passed that along to but what can you first o how did you arrive at that because we hear about the mine muscle connection but i really e heard it first from you how did you arrive at this kind of cramp tst the cavalier test as all call it a i's always word when peple named things after themselves other scientist there is now officially the cavalier test is whether or not you can cramp the muscle in the absence of load just i lexing ito the point where it hurts a little bit that would be and in a good indication that you could grow that muscle well how did you come up with us i m it' just honestly something that that made sense to be because during my it work out even as a as a young kid just starting out i always wanted to know what is at work and yil op you have last at question more ot thanklic what is it supposed to work a la and im i do not if you have ever notice but when people asked that que h of therf there being traind by a trainer and the trainer say will just do this do this exercise and they will show you how to do it but then they will say but what is it spposed to wore where 'm i supposed to feel this right people it diit just inherently asked that question a lot people will i was one of those that did that andi asked tha question not because i nwhiti was doing but just because i do not know i wantedto know what was supposed to be doing the work once you do that and you start to seek that out and cat whl the bicip is what supposed to be doing the work that i want to make sure the bicips doing the work right then i would just sort of really ike tweak the movement to make it do more work or feel more uncomfortable to get a stronger contraction knowing if that supposed to do the job it was not petiscold i'm tho learning alwol theefflection of the elbow is the break yells and the bie in the bi such responseful for supernatioi you sort i i learned other components of it but all i wanto know as to bring my arm up in a curl what is supposed to do the job i would seek out ways to make tht happen better and when i was able to do that i could feel the stronger contraction and i just i do not know what i just i was no visinary i just felt i i knew that that was goingto be better for me if the muscle ous trying to grow as being stressed more effectively when i was a attempting to do this a cross tif ren exercise is i would notice that what i could do potentially ot a curl with my arm is up in whee you asked me to flect my bystep that posicion i could not do if i was doing a concentration girl or i could not carry over to a cable curl and that should not really change ri cause the function is still largely the same there still elbow flection there still suernatinli why am i not able to do it there and that is whennat sort of cludin to me that you youre my muscle connection in not just youre mind with one muscle but in every exercise matters in varies from exercise to exercise and even if you do not gain muscle size from doing that although i think it is very hard not to especially for y not used to doing that there there is a turm i to call muscularity which is a different tries the level of sort of resting tone in the muscle that improves dramatically yeif you can learn how to just start to engage that muscle better the muscularity that resting tone in that muscle it is harder it is more it is more a at attention is tist more it its its more alive and that is all driven from being able to connect better norlogically with the muscle that you that you are trying to train i've talked about a lot inefficiency is really what you are trying to seek in movements when your trying to creat i purchafy when golt when strength is your goal efficiency of the movement is what you looking for you are lookin to have muscles tie together and work well efficiently the chest the shoulders at trisep to get a bar off of your chest er in a bench press you are not look in to make it a very inefficien yo liverages for your chest to try to grow your chest in a bench press you are trying to let the whole pa ctice come together for greater output but we you are trying to go in create muscle have purchasy or even this musculari that talk about you need the seek ways to make it feel more uncomfortable if you do not feel the discomfort that you are doing something wrong and i struggle to this day on certain muscle groups to still do that even knowing what i'm trying to work and knowing with the goal of everythng ofm preaching here it is very difficult for some muscles of certain people to do this on certain muscles but as you mention practice does help and the more you become you will consistent in deliberate with what yofre trying to do the more ofan of a result you actually get it is a couple of really poor boysid to to a delf in to further first of all my hunch was always that the muscle groups that grew easy most easily and that i could contract hardest without any a h the first tomemingto the cavalier tast got ten out its at we give it a ten out ten scalei could just lec sinch isolate those muscles sinch them grow them easily mn theire certain by parts i ont say which once as does not eally matter a that i always felt if i justid push ups they would grow in these muscles are far away for any the muscles there us we invide an push ups even though i to thing i'm doing pushops correctly you will tell me if im i'm not u but some of that i think is genetic in some of that has to do with the sports that i played when i was younger i swam i plate socker i scape word and then later i boxed and the muscles in bolved in the sports were always very easy to engage later when i went into the yem i i guess at perhaps a call to parents having kids do a lot of dynamic activity seems it might be a good idea using is this issue of o muscularity i glad you brought that up there are i have to magine a large number of listeners who do not want to get bigger they do notwant to take up a larger clothing size they do not want to take up more space in fact some of them would to take up less space but they they want that quality that you are describing which is ha often times se you hear more in the here i'm startibing a bit but i with kindness a you hear from women who havenint waight train the say i do not want get big often sometimes they do but the most most women that i've help waight train were talkd about wagtrunsay i do notwin gabt i want gat tone and i think what they are referring to is this quality that of muscular hungersan this idea that at at resting were at close to rast or any times on reaches out in crabs a glass that that the muscles almost look their kind of twitching in the skin and yet it is not suran rapskin an adomy chart types skin i this thing of muscularitor or resting tone you has a fisiological basis i think it is how readily the nerves i our communicane with the muscles and you are saying that by learning to engage the muscles more actively the resting tone or muscularity can improve have you seen that both in men and women e and and you think this is something that takes uam up keep a maintenance or that you do not want you develop that muscle you can justcontaletic coast i think everything it ke it requires up keep yousur lose it i do believe a firmly but i think that it is the the development of the connections can be harder than the mainance of the connection as i said i still struggle to the day myself with a unnamed mussegroof soit also you kow but no there is just there is there is just certain am ere is that are harder for your brain for whatever reason to jisdevelop that that connection at that type of level to creat creat that exerstrong contraction but i think that it with proper dedication focus in it i'll go right out and say calves is one there is that i'll i do not nest ta surely have a great connetion with and i also obviously must not care much cause i do not put in the time an effort to crecreate that connection as i could am i think what might happen is you yather could be a struggle there but that with with struggle comes disinterest peyu lake mell skirit on the a i'm a calf not i'm not gong to to anything about it i think if you put that thee te require at for in in the time on re petitions that you will develop that an once you do develop it it is going to stick around a lot longer than it would had you not investid any time into it it all am you are not requiring as much of bat but i mean i i do not know you mention now when you train it is you are you are just the part a heit train now you are going hard your trying to yen really forcily contract you not just moving the way i say from point a to point be but you are trying to contract the waiht through that range am that is of mind set that i try to put into whatever they ofn doing unless of course i'm focust on us strength exercise where i'm just trying to lift a greater amount and use all the muscles together but when the goal is in efficiency for hyperchasy i am really trying to create that contraction in asjust part of my training i guess t hat you that for consistency's sake as long as ofm training is happening as at if i if i get away from training that is not happening t all but even there i probably a another embarrassing admission probably you will mindfully do it throughout the day youve win ho waihe my head in certain mussagres but hr my abs or my arm or my shoulders or something i'm doing something just a sort of engage to muscles and i do think that some of that sort of aaname practice actually helps by time you go back into the gim you just cinto keep that you keep that that that connection going well it certainly obays all the rules of neurol plast disiteve the the fire together wire together montre which is the word to my calling carla shats a whold true for all aspects of nourl function including nerve to muscle these flexing throughout the day or the the am deliberate isolation of of contracting a muscle throughout the day is without question engaging your plasticity and if you were do you you were of those reputitions you gong to get less engagement of the nerve to muscle connection i can say this with with a with a smile and and with confidence because one of the first things all nor science student's learn is about the nourow muscular junction cause it is it it is a really simple example of ware the more times t he nerve fires and gets the muscle to contract the stronger that connection get receptors are brought there et cetera et cetera t the whole bunch ofe mechanisms for topic to another a podcasts but u basically that practices throughout the day is makes total sense and works ethere is no ther believing thre's no science behind that in terms of yo the application of it you do it when you catch yourself doing it ou kno right hind the time ye know but i it is deafiliy som that is easily done discreetly and yeyu you mind up to actually i think in ana resivilia when i i did talk about am growing your arms by just improve youmproving the connection not that that connection itself is applying any load or or youf resistance that significant to cret overlook for growth but it is the development of that connection that i then take back with me into the gim at a more effect of level that takes every exercise i do there and makes a more effective it is a sharpening the bleed to speak ye certainly obeys the laws of a a nerve to muscle physiology one tid just touch on a a couple of things i if the goal is to challenge muscles and one is dividing their body into lets ay three or forday a week splet or or maybe up to six how do when a muscles relit ready to be challenged again i've heard okay every forty eight hours is protyuencs increas is and then well get into this and then it drops off but frankly if y train o my legs hard i can get stronger from work out to work out or t lhese better in some way work out to work out a leg work out to leg work out training them once every five to eight days if i train them more often i get worse thet whatever that forty eight hour to seveny to hour thing is somehow my legs do not obey that ore maybe something elseis wrong with me but i'm sure there' manythings else wrong with me but how do you assess recovery at the local level meaning at the level of the muscles is that will tike out soreness and getting better stronger or more repetitions et cetera and then the systemic level the level of the nervous system and i'd love o you to tell us about the o the tool that again i learned from you which is afturly using a physical scale because it turns out this is that will let you tell what the tool is but that tool is also actively being used for assessing cognitive decline and cognitive maintenance and cognave function in people with illtimers an do mention i makes tol o sense makes tol sense i i i u regarding the the the first part of the question you how do you how would you cint of dictate when a muscles recovered i do think that what your experiencing is totally real a that different muscles recover at different race and i've always been fascinated by this concept thought tabout in ternally with mut with my teem but i feel li what we really need the holy grail to to training is going to be when we are able t crack the cod on an individual basis when a muscle is recovered and that is going to dictate its training scedule and the fact that you might have a bystep that can be traind you ve we a pulling work out of regular byclet that it car work it forget the split at the momentyou may have a bycet that is able to be train that can be trained again the next day and then the next day it ay may be nee to day off after that in that that can vary from person a person for sure and it can vary from muscle to muscle in that person over the course of time as you mentiond because the systemic recoveries get in pact all those muscles anyway but let say you are systemically recovering every muscle itself is going to have u a o a recoveryry and i think what is fascinating is that when you talked about before we to train this weker we have a the way our mind looks at training wot if that was the case that the byseps that bysep is a slave to the rest of your trainsplit youare us why does it have to be also at the end of every eighth day or or whatever when it might be spon better to something much more frequently and your legs are also being thrown into that maxstas it migke menser concept wor he is the on trainin one set and be done for fourteen days i mean it there is there is there is such varyability between musclegrups in you'r you are linking them all together o i i think that coming back in using muscle soreness as a guy line for that is is one of the only tools we have in terms of the local level we do not really have you being able to measure let say a p q levels in side of a muscle would be amazing at at a local level to see how how recovered that muscle is but that becomes fairly invasiv at least to my knowledge becomes fairly invasive what are our tools i mean i i think that at the basic level thescle that muscul can relate to an easily identify and then use that as a guy lin if you'r training when you'r really sore a is probably not a great idea and that its probly good indication that that muscles not recovered but at least hearing what you and i are saying here might be a comfort to the person say yet it is possible that is not recovered just because forty eght hours of the recommendation and just because research points to muscle putting cythis is needing are re stimulation well may be not maybe you are not necessarily there yet you are in that and for that muscle you are not there yet a 's all really interesting stup but as far as the the a the systhemic you recovery i thing ite's a lot of ways you you talk about resting heart rate measured in the morning o at all different kinds of of a you cor temperature and things that that might become altered in a state of a non recovery but grip strength is very very much tied to performance and recovery and when ous of the mets we used to actually take grip strength measurements is a base line in spring training all a time nobviously the baseball player youre grippin a bad you picture you are grippin a bollic you grip having good grip strength is important f we ou notice ti we had a very weak grip it is just a good focal point of a specialized training component for he yourthers every day with those guss now we do iin spring training with you sort of a base line entry level measurement and then we would we would measure it throughout the seas on maybe once every two weeks or three weeks and in in theor the idea there was to to manage to yo manage o recover measure the recovery a thit us gaven away there to to to o to determine over all recovery you are grip straingth is pretty highly correlated we have found that wat with one of those scales those old fashioned bathom scales at a the bathen beonor of you can get which by the way almost impossible i believe just in oure searching for the last scale to put in that vitio and we almost could not find on aus everything is did it al on eveoot tis ofm lug i the old fashioned dial controls 's ie ham old mackin toshas ters ta theres a huge mar em an phone n an hkeep your phones now an thirty years the amphone now i wer the lot o yoaring alot to i wound u a a finding one and it is a great tool for just squeezing the the the a the scale with your hands an seeing what tup about put you can get a i think we all can relate to this when you just visu lizes imagine the last time wou were sick ere th were you ore just try us ye next time you wake up in the morning when you first wake up in the morning you still groggy try squeeze your hand try to make a fist as hard as you can you gess that there angry at your fist because it will not contract is hard as it can you do not have the ability to just create the output and that is because in that state you are still sleepier still fatiguia your you are not even awake the theo the the whole level of this point well that is the that is still a a anactual phenomena that happens that theo a a lack of recoveryor lack of wakefulness or what every one say is is going to lead to a decreased output there when you start the measure that on a daily basis you get a pretty good sense of where you are at and i think when people start to see a drop off of temper san or or or even greater o of their a grip output a you really should skip the gim that daybes i do not think there is much you'r ging to do there that is going to be that that beneficial even if it is the day the train legs are whatevery day it is i i love this tool it is simple its low cost if you can find such a scale yes you culd also find one of those grippers that am and you dids in a very non quantitative way a but better would be a scale we can aushe measure how hard you can squeeze this thing at given time a day i it draws to mind just te old adnor a scienced fact wheny in the world of circatian norobiology one of the consistint findings is that in the middle of your night time you will the weike people up an they will say do this test an the laboratory thay use a different apparatus but the sentually the same thing and inthe mill the night grip strength is very very low and if mid morning grip strength as high and as the body temperature goes up into the afternoon grip strength it higher and high and higron lhen drops ofp tes a circatian rithm and gar temperater tou yyo on dos tat more or less the same time each day youn use it but it i think it is brilliant and im in its simplicity and it is directness to these upper motor ner ons caus that is really what it is assessing your bility again it is about the ability to contract the muscles hard if you cannot do that you are nt thin agat an effective wor ye they also i meen there certainly are more sophisicated tools to us as a a pt that we have a a hangrip tinomometers and we can a we can measure one side at a time to i'll not really im m getting a little bit blinded by the fact that both hands of squeezing into that scale in i'll get reathe left right comparisond but even at that level that cul give you a little bit ore deteil that that comes of the cost of tha prett expense of the vices but if is listen if you ere an athle you the the two hundred three hind boxs it cost to have one of those would be well worth the ad an investment well and i'm sure some of our listeners were want one to cause they are a lot of a te geaks out there im not teckin distree geaks but you teckyer i what is it called again is a handgriped inomometer gripped one in a done no matte i' said o o said iof with it with the great eastcose acten by me in a terrible abotched it a west coast version im thank you well will a put that in the shownots also im i think recovery is key we always heare about sleep yugrow when you sleep and incidentally your brain you stimulate learning when you are awake obviously but the reordering of nerl connections happens in sleep this is why sleep is the way to get smarter provided you are also doing the learning part the sleeves away to get strong r fivd you are also doing the training part you have got some really intryou have put out interesting content over the years in terms of a even sleep position i one of the major changes that i made to my sleep behaviour is to not have the sheets tucked in at the end of the and i'll tell you this had a profound impact on several things first of all my feet have always been the bane of my existence broke them ubon scape wording they i and i notice when i'd ron id get shin splints and and then i stard to notie that my feet sort of you are the p t there kind of floppy in the yourso as if i was ppointing my toe slightly all the time at rest if is im and i realize that based on listening to you previously that my sheets were rap tight not hotel tight right right nothing in the hotel be fer and i started i'm releasing that the sheets at the end of the bed and i also sto our doing some tobe alis work i a front of shin's work essentially changed everything my back pain from running my shin splincs disappeared my posture improved although i my audience will tell me that it still needs improvement there i's five or ten people at once it upstra ive out sheu had chairs and tarmalras ia very nice tars ri i saw 'm trying by i'm trying there im but this is fascinating right im the position that one sleeps and i id fortunately have never hading shoulder issues nd oc come wood but thin you coul just talk talkd ust a little bit about sleep and sleep position forsake of waking position and movement is this i think is a very unique and very powerful way to think about sleep this part cast has done a lot of episodes about keeping the room cool getting sunlight in your eyes itsed o ow to get into sleepin but you have talked about physically what positions might be better to sleep into a please pleasa enrichus yet i an first of all that you some people's opinions of of that type of content as that you yu know you sleep in the cot the position that is most comfortable to you an surely your sleeping great i i understand that we all want of sleep that is the go en we put our had on the pillow as actually fall asleep and wake up in the morning and not know what that will happen unless you had a dream but beyond that there are certainly physical components to sleep that that is why lot of times peoplewake up and say yuat that you can incur pretty serious injuries and sleep people will wake up and have a shoulder that did not bother them at all be hom in the next day or even for weeks after because of the one sleep position they put themselves in in a prolonged way and they happen to have a deep sleep even through the discomfort a that can do actually some some some damage it is understandable that the body can incur some strain and stress if your sleeping in the wrong way one the things i say right up the bad is sleeping on your stomach dost does not really have many benefits you are you'r putting yourself into a position that is depending upon the the the orantation of your your mattress or how many pillars you are using put you'r basinly putting yourselves into a excessive extension a the lumbars pine which for most people is not very good if you are if you'r dispation a i guess that might be helpful for for reloking the disk but i mean for the most part a your hands are then usually not at your sides but they are up under your arms you have got them into sert of internrotation up over elevation in your head it is this not a great position you all sove to crank your neck for one sire the other nor to breathe ore you be your face down straightento the pillow i would skip that one and there some people that are total belly sleepers and i and i would just say listen i do not think that is the the most healthful long turn waye for you to sleep try to adopt the different position a sleeping on your side off in times is is also brought along with that the legs and nees coming up towards the chest prolong hipflection leste't were doing enough for that during the dbeas ye won wer ein right ri reay really to do atout ten hour ator eight hours or some whery at night that an it is just is reinforcing you and as we said too you let us say you trained that day you just reinforcing muscle shortening overnight know were were the body is healing and trying do creat changes in your body a no wother reasons why recommend stretching our static stretching prior to going to bed ly people do not really want to do it at that point aus it could take ten minutes five temtence pen in pon howming muscles you have to stressh but now it is good sort of try to establish is longer length temporarily prior to going into a state where yofre to be not moving and recovering an in in creating you a changes in the muscle a that kind of i do not say it does not rule out the theside sleep proside sleeper could be very very helpful for somebodyat has appene or other other condition again it is not an aller nothing approach but it just somethingthat you need to pay attention to when you are on your back you ere talking about in your feet are wedged underneath a tight sheets at the end of the bed and most of us unless we consciously are pulling them up do not prefer our beds to have orly loose sheets at the end of the bed hard to make to thet in the morning right it is you are got to one to have theof them tight well i' 'm saying as you experience you are going to have o thes this ay prolonged plan reflection that is going to likely lead to shorter yo calves over time am because you are lacking all that length for that long perior time that you could have if you just loosened up the sheets and allowed your feet to just youon't hang out where theye are now the resting position of the ankle hatis not in doorsifflections gon to be still in some planorfechion but not be driven down and pull down into that position and i think what happens actuallyas people who get uncomfortable that way even in their sleep will shift away from that by traning either on to ther sile or stomach there is deafily an impact of the body position and sleep and figuring have the best way that you can still sleep of course and get your rest but have a mindfli towards what is doing to your body and choose the one that is least aow abraceip to your body is the way you should go terrific and again it is really helped me and a i big believer based on good sience out of stamford and elsewhere that as much as we can be nazal breathers and sleep we probabe should be i do not know you have done any content to u yet about i taping the mouth shut with some medical take but yive it the the benefits of nazal breathing and sleep er pretty tremendous but it takes a little bit of training i will do and the training is very simple it is i will piece of medical tape again a topic for another time i'm glad you mention stretching i wask cand ask about stretching a a bit later but let us talk about stretching when is the best time to stretch for particular types of results and maybe you cald define some the different types of stretching im yeu just mention a a little bit of would you call light stretching or il get i'm completely ni eve here on stretching lemme tu say i can think of stretching where i hold the stretch and really trying e lengthen in air quots folks o the p ts jumpin all i knw what it is but nutricion and the pts on line ar really they got pitch forks in both hands ictati that is a reason a tht's a reason evolution i think i ser not nutricions much but the pts have become a little but angry these tdays i see whill i always say wit feelings of powerlessness comes aggression vey that folks in any in any case they are stretching where i'm i'm youn trying to consciously lingthen again in air quotes the muscle i'm not yanking on the limb o bobbing up and down tmad you cald defind the different types of stretching people maybe give us some rough guie lines about with e nouht to do it cold or warm before training after training et cetera yet there there is not ves that es a lot of different types of stretching that caun get even to yo poneuf stretching in things that are little bit more a yo nitch but in general h to basic form to stretching or act of stretching and passive stretching m you are yor in youon your dynamic work and in your passive stretching is done with the goal of trying to create an increase a in a the flexibility of the muscle whether your actually increase in ta length of that musclewat yo more e your doing is increas in the resist their decreas in th resistance of that muscle to one of stay at a certain level of flexibility when we can sort of take the breaks off and allow that muscle to to allow us more range of motion were inherently in increasing flexibility without in sily having to increase the length of that muscle a that is usually done at a time far away from your work out because they have shown where this type of strutching dumb prior to in activity and it could be a a structured activity olike lifting or could be al bit less structure competing a sport in i in a spontaneous type away that there is a period of recalibration that is needed after doing this because youre disrupting the length encho relationship of th muscle that causes you to not necessarily be able to rely on these ive talked about before stored motor angrums in your mind in terms of this is the pattern for how i swing a golf club say am now introducing a little bit of flexibility or ad in flexibility or range because of the stretching i did before it takes may be a whole or to or three to match up again oh this is the this is what yis trying to do that gulsling than i that i rememberid again is not remembering that every component i have to bend by right riskback ten degrees and i have to beend my elbow ind after your body stores these patterns for motor efficiency in when i have to start matching up that stored pattern with what is feeling knew because of the increased range i can impair a performance and again it can happen even a gim workd out where you talking about your first second set thir set a were it maybe the reprocautions are not as big cause o just do youextur sets but in performance if you script your first three arounds you plan on pugtorin to shot i y your six over after three or you dor done enoso i think it matters there a as far as the dynamic youre we we relegate that as i meantion showard towards the end the day when it is not going to in pack performance but even may be have the additional benefit of creating the the feeling of length or the increase or decrease in resistance to this length a at a time when i know my body is going to try to tend to heal and heel shorter never longer but hel shorter if i can introduce a little bit of the extra a length or or decrease resistance to to that lengt i's a better time to do it i think of promotes a a better recovery a if i want to strut a starret interrup you stretching later in the day a because i a i'm entreaged by this conco of heel shorter yeso part of the healing and recovery process means a shortening in the muscles this is the tensing up in ely yow could you laborate just a bit on that and then tat tar to break your flow but the ut a an gan nuchus basically know what whas been shown as that when when the the repair process muscular pair from lesa strike training during the day the repair process usualy results in a muscle that is slightly shorter rather than increased hin length it insist that it is you muscles prefer the sort of you ratchet their way down into that than that a contraction and then you maintain that that that more comfortable lengtension relationship when you are sleeping it ittends to you air on the side of shorter rather longer when ideally we do not really want that we want to maintain is much of that length because with more length we actually have more leverage rite that muscle has more levish to contract if it was all the way contracted yand you really cannot ovus we know generate much force in a muscle it is already mactionally contracted i think we we want e do something tat we whatever we can whatever little weapons we have an arsonal that could allow us to do this prior to sleep and again as just making it a a conscious choice to do it a time of the day that makes the lo thet more sense o dynamic stretching is rally not done for tat purpose of trying to create any type of of feeling of act or or increasing the the pretensial length as you said of the muscle but more the readiness of the muscle to perform an increasing yo exploring the ends of that range of motion in a more dynamic ways your not hanging out there in desrupting that lengtentio relationship was just sort of touching the ends of those barriers that when you feel movement again it feels looser it feels more ready and t an obvously the same time warming up blood flow all the benefits we get from just warming up in general yo that is that is the series you provicing a much of times but ye leg swings and in yo but kicks in o lunge walking lungh is and all type to touch is to touch is all those kind of drills those active stretching drills or lunging with rotations ofor the upper body to try to get some of the thorasic fine involve to those of the drills that people will do prior to training that are both excitatory in terms of just the nervous system but also helpful for just the general warm up the body cause the blood flow but from muscle readiness standpoint not inpairing the performance while the same time exploring the increased range is cause ase the first to touch you do is not tige the last touch touch yo me does not evinclude to an touch do touch attempt trit i assolye you kow those those are going to improve with each subsequent wret and iving does the people actually that you coan see those the actual changes from rep one direct seven you just feel ready you feel more lurt and ready to go in your work out the dynamic type of stretching a and i mentioned earlier on eunolic what i've had to do thi sort of increase my warm up focus i i think that is more of what i try to do these days i try to be a little bit more alert to the fact that youre abod y's not ready hat when i was when i was workingwin antonya brown i remember he wousd spend twenty minutes thirty minutes on all dynamic work and i've never seen him body spend that long on their dynamic work but he said he just didhim feel right and ready to go unless he did a lot of that and i mean his his dynamic strutching routine would be a work out for most everybody t it is crazy ho how much he did the is proautly ser aman thing and a you a had the great fortune of working with and improving there the're abilities uhm but i can only imagine acause i've also imention he is pretty strong in the general i you mean thyou know and it always amazes me the guies that make it to that level no matter what sport they do they are gifted in everything thevid right used to make me laugh all the time with the mets because kno matter what i ping pon you kno anything he because of his hand i coronation anything great at jump rope i remember he had not done a lot of jump rope am i i i think jumpras from the best things you could do from a conditioning standpoint it is actually's fairly interesting is not just u it is not to harsh on the joints tepending you even thosie of polistic mo anm he was not avt te midiht if you listenes to this e can whike killing about i wi was better at him a than at jump roping whet tholy things i could do and then i gave him about five days and he completely blooving out the water to the mor i could ever keep up with him any more he made it look effortless it is that is the worthy athlet an some one comes out no matter what they pick up they are good at it and i think that when you see goides this in the jan theyr strangt levels tend to be pretty dam good and ther and there abilities are corination there they are everything just tends a ser to be good at that level nit sort of mades of me why those godes can go pick op a golf club i't go sho seventy too and in having never ly played they are just the're just naturally good at whatever they do youi've a couple on i'm smiling os abit couble really clos friends who did a number of your some several decates in the seal teams and i do not know that they'r skill level at everything is high as as you are describing for athletes but they are level compatitiveness on i oceans one with one there is no chance that i'm going you kow i't swim pat ever ever he actuly goes back and fore sometimes just tak up hony ah much i appreciate thank you pat i'm in drown yet but he but an adition o that we could lay horse shoes and it is this switch that just sclips on he is got a murder t very nice i in general they tant be ras but but the level compativeness lother er ron re ther'rs try it for they are try to bet themselves and i'm try to bet you that is right ofm not even in the niif the competition you are not even there i exact o thank you no heels it were worse it is true i's it is a remarkable thing i'm glad you mentione jump roping i used to skipp rope for warm up for boxin no an as to wer were three three menute rounds or somethinglike that i'm but i i'm glad you brought it up because i'm skipping rope is something that i obviously haws a carty of askculy component there is the condition compon there is timing and and it is kind of interesting why you can frustrating when you do not get it i h which you on the her if yusing that a rope im just curious if you just give us a quick a skipping rope one on one you to see people jumping with i'm both feet and tells we will link to of anyof i'm if there was one and i missed it you to see people doing hin neese you people asily shuffling i ou wont see people doing double dutch what you want et i doing over time all of the above may be not double dutch but all all the above i may i think that that is the cool thing about it right one sweet sort of master the skilcas for all of us that first jump with the two feet going together is a challenge cause you just got time that rope yon got time you jump and then we get board as we often do as humans we get board what we can do in one to take on new challenges then it becomes one at ta time or than it becomes side to side hops right in all those things are beneficial i believe narlogically to enhancing the abilit to do the skill as a hole but also just because i'm i'm such a believer and training in all three plains just doing straight up and down first as now i can you front of plane side oside motion and the i can even do small little twists or corkscrews yoeu call em im it requires at diffe you no more be better than i do there it requires different narlogical hatterns to be all e a coordinate that because you are changing the orantation of your body in space it is not just thi'm changing the exercide fom changing how my body in terpret that exercise because what is happened to my body ins face i i love whatever people lind up doing but i'm i'm amazed there are people i just are to fall in this young woman on his ter graham who is a i'vil give her plug out of this i ann a skips or something and see is ridiculous that i loger n mesmerize hat what she can do with the rope it it is is not extremely athletic endeavor believe when it gets to be at that level in the speed in the precision in the yo in in i think one of the goalls thit you want to be ale to have is to where you'r feeling as if youere almost effortlessly dancing without a rope where you are just bouncing off o the ball of your foot i'm an it is an important skill to learn to whether you go back to run or or even even jag right just you more casual running learning how to land is important one the drills that people should try is tro to jump on your heels just stand up pull your toes off the ground right an just jump from your heels and land on your heels you will feel it in your jaw you will doly feel your jaw rattle when you land on your heels there is no shock absorption capabilities through your heels meantime a lot of people land on their heels a lot when they when they run and you are just your body's not built to absorb the forces the ball of your foot could is really built as a spring an in the foot is a to me as the physical theripis the foot is always being on f the most make av you ting i havena bad feet i have flat feet it loos i got flippers if i took my if i took my shoes off that i l a a waren scupiffence there is no there is no adaptability of that foot to the surface only when it is completely cave than flattan that the job of hi of the foot is to be adaptable le there is maybe there is some adaptability t cu floppy but at the same time at some point that critical junction when you are g then step through and you need to build a push off the foot has to actually changes in the mid foot itself to becom a rigid levers of they call it you you are going from a mobile adaptor to a rigid lever that rigid lever litrally locks up mitarsel joint to become solid that you can push off it with leverage if you lack that capability all those stresses that are supposed to be born by the foot go up into the ankle into the knee into the hip into the low back he learning how to land in in start to train your your body to a to a experience ground reaction forces the right way is critical to all other function in all her disability up the cannachain and jumping rope is one o the best ways to learn how o do that great i i own a jump rope i' love doing it in the morning while i get sunlight in my eyes it is a she a a proto calli picked up from tim pharis mention as listenrs o my pokcasting om a broken record would get sunlight in your eyes even through cloud cover its just sets your sleep rhythms in your waking resms a yot ata on and on om but tom as they be kind of warring for people and i want to get them off their phone jumping ropes also disagreat when wink up to a jumping rope can be a the cardio work out the fifteen your thirty menut i theren there is no that hibra that were toing by before f no your not you are not necessarily dropping down of the ground doing berpes but i just look at it as a more athletic endeaver because of the cordination involve than just simply walking or a jogging and you it is not much of a a equipment requirement the very men man cost and id even use a rope or or something if you although we weven instructuble that you use no rope nd jist pretend i know it just emove the arms truely r ant never get a hit the rope which is good but it the same to say neveryng if you doing it wrong but less you can you can move through and get the same benefits tou the feet alov it alov it am i told myself before sitting down with you to day that i was not going to focuss on specific exercises because there is such a wealth of incredible content you put out there that people could just put in to you to bor elsewhere and and arrive at the proper way to do a chin or a dipor a for whatever purpose but there is one exercise in one particular motion that i'd to a discust for a moment because i believe that learning about this cautionary note from you is one of the reasons that i've maintained steady training for thirty years w no major injury knock gon wood and that is the upright row one thing that whether not be weight train or not i sect of this podcast and senser and we beap this out an i i dou you get beef aboutni i o what i we always get beefin a socia immediate platform erever put out by now i gets tom i get some from it but im im la i'm fully prepared to defend myself the but here here is the reason for askingabout this i never really cared much for upright rows it is not an exercise i tended you but a one thing that is apparent in all my colleagues in every child i see in every adult i see is that almost everybody is an inward to rotation now folks think ou if you stay i think i learn this from you all if you stand up straightening just point your thumbs out a a thumbs out but you are just point your hands are down your point youre thumb straight out i deally the would go straight out most people the thumbs ing me pointing toward one aother dis most people ar starting to look somewhere between a a i non human primate and a melted candle im t bhen to the hips et cetera from too much sitting we are all sitting where an inward rotation but i learne from you that the upright road compromises at some important aspects of our shoulder a mechanics an can be ash sort of dangerous movement in some ways i'm sure there is a safe way for people to do it but i've always made it a point now on the basis of of this advice to a not do upright rows but i was not doing them before but to really strive for am external rotation on thinks bench dips on on a number of different things whenever i can i tryind going to external rotation and prive yound without looking an idiot walk around my palms facing noutward please tell us about internal external rotation im the upright row is one aspect of tat but why this is importt not just for weight training but as it terms of posture and mechanicsand and not looking a a melted candle or partially melta candle im actually love i i i'm happy it olk bags i love i love the shoulder as a joyt i think pitys tend o fallin love a certain areas in the shoulders one of the cool aries for me hes the foot is but the shoulder has the most mobility in the body of any of any join but it is also got the leaststability for there is always that trade off of mobility in stability your stability comes from certain mustle groups and whele the ones that the only mustle group that actually externally rotate the shoulders can be the rotator cuff oke and unless you are devoted to training through external rotation in exercises that our going to extraly rotate the shoulder you are not training that function and it is easy for us in everyday life especialy those that are not training to not ever really undergo any of those tresses that could be beneficial to canteracting what happens freely and naturally which is interrotation wl you think about the embalance created just by nature and how we live our lives internrotation far far far outways extern rotation you need to address it and the reason why you need you address is because you need to normal lives those byo mechanics to the shoulder if you want their long term helt and one of the functions of the shoulders to raise our arm up over our head and wif we do that from an interly rotated position we are going to have a higher likelihood of creating stress inside that joint funny thing is i talked about before my my pt brethren can be somewhat aaa angry these days all no what happen but for the angry they want they want a discredit the existence of something a shoulder in pingement which i do not know how i m certain studied we both we all read studies than we we studies will say one thing one day potentially conflict entirely in a differen direction some studies will point to the non existence ofaof a shoulder in pingement meanwhile we have thankfully a diginal motion ex rais that will literally show the impingement occur in real time in real function and as one of the limitations them off on a tangent here but those types of ex rage of that type of floroscoby that we have nowadays gives us such insight that we never have befork as we are taking static ex rays of some one lying down on a table when i want to see what happens when the actually raise my arm up over my head in function and they in the tools now existend do that we see that that the problems occurring because in order to get normal mechanics in free up the joint maximally inside you need to extering rota as you raise the arm up if your muscles are not firing in thei're not necessarily o as strong as the intern rotation by us that pulls them in you are alscang for trouble every time you do that wull this exercise is literally putting you in elevation an internrotation and if you were to walk into a pt office and some one said i think he is got in pingement will you diagnose him there is a test cause a hawkin's kennedy tests and i would put you in the position i know we are not visible o this point through the pogcast but i'll put you in this position here where i have your arm elevated and your hand pretty much under your chin pushing down ward on that to create that iternal shoulder rotation pretty much the exact position that were in whene we are holding a bar in in an upright row some will say awle just do not go high goonly up to the level of the chest but you are still in this interly rotated position the the thing that i think frustrates me the most about the exercise as that i have an alternative and the alternative does the same thing in terns of helping the muscles grow by simply fixing the by mechanics of the exercise but just allowing the hands to go higher than the elbows soinstead of the elbows being higher than the hand which drives you in toe interrotation if the elbow is lower than the hand the hand being higher here i'm an extern rotation nd i could do something called a high pull and still get the same abdunction of the arm and still get the same benefits of the shoulders tha delts in the traps without having to undergo any of the stresses that would come from the somewhat awkward movement of an upright row and for those listening i will put a link to a short clip of what this looks but basingly what jeff is doing and tell me if i'm describing as a incorrectlyer correctly jeff as a taking your two thumbs and pointing behind you and i rigt and yon si elways up kind of near the chin and apointing behind you go aheaded that way somebody directing the air playing y ask em back whar ack e a i feel what they call that i think it is called some oforeign is the action of where they direct the plans i som the the flags or whatever someone of course tell me i'm wrong about that to which is why i say these things because i i being told what thet what the correct answer is a in any case aso this replaces that the upright row and an pro doest number of other important things s well yet wall it again u this to night i wen without naming names or programmes inga that when i got involved and nd wheni got involved in in a aftly next ti first started oo a mon line i presence there was a very very very popular a programme that was out there that i just for fun i wanted a has a ptinthe e nurtyd things we do but i wanted a value weight the the work out structure and i went and i looked at every rep over a course of a week and there are something eight hundred and ninety repetitions are something done a and zero of them were dedicated exton rotationin the shoulder you think about that me get it was ho very popular program that was done by a lot of people there is no there was no focus at all no tdedicated focus towards creating a balance to an action that is predominantnt remember is not just because we sit with that posture but the fact that are chess can internally rotey ar last can entoa rota there is muscle other big muscles that participate in things that we do every day that will further entilly rotate the shoulder the only weapons we have for exton rotation are those little rotiticuff muscles and three of them actually three of the fore and the job is ti sort of actively and consciously train them to really the boring exercise is right you have seen them with the band yuyou you anchor a band to a poll you stand with the band in te opposite hand fits anchore to the pole my left side i'v got the band of my right side you see people where they can a rotate their hand towards the back agankind wyouare saying but at a lower elevation taking the back of my hand to try n to point it to someby behind me a well that that is that it is one the ways to train the musclets it is just of one function of the shoulder external rotation of the shoulder and you need to do it and again it is not that if somebody was doing more extrn rotation work could they absorbe the upright row better probably because as they elevated the arm they probably have a little bit more of a contribution from the roteder cuff that to what one of the functions is the centra lives the head of the humorous inside of the glenoi the of the capsil as it risees up it stays central as a post of migrating up a because the deltoy likes to pull up if the rotiti cuff has some ability to cantera ct the upward pull of the dell then it can maintain a more healthy relationship with over heboitso just realizing that that that that function's only game through doing these exercises im we we would private dedi keep more time there but the ro tit the upright row might be better absorbed by that person caus they have a with more straingth but again why because if you havenat exercise that does the same thame for what you are trying to do muscularly to build the muscles that it effects why will not you jus do it where you can still see extn actually pick up more repetitions of extern rotation you nes se you'r getting none of the harm all the benefits i see zero reason to ever do the upright row the people will argue thire's the way they argue that i've done this for thirty years and i've never huart myself and i always say yet yet i listen the goldess did not hurt yourself ever even if you its sort of the chimpionship game you knw you might play the game of your life but if you lose you' lost and when you get into the end of teother the record books youre till lost even if you have the game your life you lost i do not careif you do i for thirty years no pain is still doing it in there is no pain i'm giving you an option that is going to give you the same results an the exercise at your seeking that is why you are doing the exercise without the possibility of having ththe the bad outcome come from it i get ol tat you defensive oote the movement i feel it is why would to do that now it makes it makes us being able to train for a long period of time and feel good i a proud to say you knw and i do not have the kind of youn excellic we do not have a lot of impressive athletes in our family treeer and then there you oy som fit individual some less fit individuals but i really belive i's op putting in the work consistently over time and the the more the more often you can wake up not in pain the better im and thi think that being an external rotation as offenast possibles good this actually a good friend who is a yoga teacher told me this also problem with the yogies lot all the downward dogs up for those listening a youcan think of inward rotation as thumbs down just think it thums down anmrtation is not bad but less thumbs down wore thumbs up ti external rotation for for those just listening maybe they gives a o visual the more exercise you can do in external rotation o the better it seems on average im i'd love to chat with you just o a little bit more about bo mechanics im and i and this is a personal thing that i that again your contect really help sall for me one is i thought i had lower back pain ot i had siatic a badly that on a few trips i a work trips years ago when i was doing wot more in ernational travel i mean s hard to stand up sometime on you lik excruciating pain i do not want to take medication ia want you back surgery in the end turns out it was not a back injury at all im and one of the things that help fix it was this just learning about this thing called the medial glue and you i at of vidio it is said fix back pain and then you quite actually see that some back pain is not really about the back at all and am and have me do an exercise wher allowed me to try an exercise where i i lay on my side an such shoul pointing my my toe down the top toe down almost pointing toe down and thend would slowly lift the the lak up while pointing the toe down i maybe i got it e rager thend en holding that and there is a there is a muscle that suresits at the top of the glute cind of peaks out everyone sin a while you can feel it there with your thumb which is i think it you had push back on it a a bit craing that mind muscle link again and and there with propereception the actual feeling of a muscle literally with it with a lim we know for the based on the noral circuits for movement that that enhanceis the contractile ability of muscle if you touch your byce ap you you literally can contract it more more strongly in this makes total sense based on a norl muscular physiology have me do that repeatedly ats'st our doing that in my hotel room and the pain started to disappear and then it came back again the afternoon i did it again in the afterso this is something i did for three or four days and lone behold a backpains gone i handed this off to my father because he me has a slightly lower right shoulder i think that our gate is probbly thrown off by this is prigan at i inner who knows he handed off to somebody younow it turns out that we do not suffer from backpain and if ac now i do not fromranyphing because i i was doing this exercise which i think is helping my low an my medial glutetwo reasons why raise this one an lotty eyes have the right side siatica can people to keep the wall at theiris one idea were left ide satic a there are a lot of people male and female who think they have back pain when they do not ach he at back pain and the other thing is that is about a general question about my mechanics or steamin about my maccans i had of a feeling that a lot of what people thnk is back paint er knean pain or neckpain or head ach foler min is actually a the consequence of something that is happening above or below that sight of pain i and this is a whole landscape of of stuff relay to pt an nd and recovery an and pain management but maybe you just a educate us a bit on this and why this works what is the medial glue why did it make my called back pain disappear and how should people think about pain and i uses a sadway to get into but deeper discussion about pain and recovery sure the ther this is definin a i big cornicopia pt stuff here but i and thi's my love first of all that vidia thatis it it is my proudest vidial th i have an the reason being is that i is helped many people we we get co the comments on avio every day a i do not know m if you's got nown thirty som my million or is ther ou will link to it the others oonus and in why sly was a it was a little bit of an after thought vedal in terms of this its a it is origin i think that that they maybe jeste wa s having some problems or something thown le betalow back pain and and i showed im and it help right away ons likl o we can make of it lon it cause thit is this will help people uno not not everybody if you have a real this problems ike on to help because your not changing the structural problem that is there but as you said lot people do not no and and even discis yous e om a lot of m not operative you would want to try these things first a as far as what you sort of experience sometimes has that glupe medious rely tightens down in that sats again from por by mechanics up and down the cannant chain it can actually press on the siadic nerve and give you what they caus suitosiatica ne aware it it i your ni your you are making it up it is n't your not feeling that pain over that same siic distribution but it is not cause from a disk is not cause from something mechanical there it is caused by the fact that this glu medious has has posturely to become a problem for you or weak because you do not train it and you need to address it unlike not unlike any other muscle in the body there are common trigger points in common areas where the muscle will become tightened or painful or spasm and you can basically apply pressure to these areas to and then sort of thread that muscle through the pressure by pushing down through there and then contracting the muscle which is why you go through that action of y we i thng we call a tottabber but stabbing down and lifthing up as tabin down on tit the taking that that glue medius through its function thats basically kind of working underneath the downward pressure of the finger and that tends to help you to almost a need out what might be the that trigger point and that is why people can see immediate relief there because once the trigger point let us go a it feels and that is the good the comments are in that vitia my got i thut i could not walk i've not my ho tel floor i did this and wn fixed and meanwhile then it could come back because your body is wha i being more this is is how i'e been noin a engrain to be might come back with them when you do another round of it an another round of it and then finally astessisara i'm not ging to any more cont eases up than you can relieve yourself of those of those trigger points you do that up and down the back there is other people that get that in that sort of inside their shoulder blade at that same type of cramping in another area a but honce that takes place will then the job that i think people have is become educated that yof the glute medius is different than the glue maximus ou their functions are are different yen you half to work on not just extending the hip but all abduction of the hip ec to rotation of the hip same thing isn'n in the shoulder and this actualy said ways nicely into what into the whole concertur tog abalic the body is a mirror image the hip is the shoulder right the ankle is the wrist the foot is the hand the that they funk thenee is the elbows ther two hince joins they function that way well with the shoulder you have got that mobility that comes from having all that freedom of motion but the stability is lacking well the samething with the hip you have got mobility but if you do not fully stableize it by training all the muscles of the hip and if you do not strength in the external rotation of the hip then you you have youre you areging to have issues it is not bind te canygin a work the same way if you think of the body is a series of you bands yot pulling in different directions at different levels of tension you are being pulled into one direction of the other just by the balance of tension from one weak area to one dominantly tight area and you need to make sure that you can sort of balances out in order to eliminate some of the daptations and compensations that happen what i say when we look it sort of the the a the the body is a whole most often wherever you are feeling the pain is habsolutely not to blan there is not blamt it is somewhere above were below as you hinted that you are talking about the the knes of my my favorite example of it whenever you have knee pain telliu tenan it is which i i i have for ever 've had yo bad bat cases of toli to nigce where squatding is very difficult for me it is not the knee the knee is the knee is literally a hinge joint that that yothere is minor rotation capabilities of neebut it is a hinge joint and it is being impacted by the hip in the ankle and in the foot as i said before how critical the foot is if you thought of of the knee being the the middle of a train track where the femer down your thigh and your shin down below your knee where the train track would happen if the foot collapse is at the bottom al of a sudden that trin track on the bottom gets torked just a little bit well whose gan to feel that the most the ary where its torking which is at the knee the stresses are can be felt there meanwhile the problems the foot or the problem is the ankle people that are chronic ankle sprainers you are almost always going to wine up having back pain because the ankle sprain causes weakness and maladaptations in the ankle that then gets connected through the chain because now one side distort the ankle on the shin now the knee is trying to maintain it is abily to hinge smoothly it torks on the femer to do that whell the femers now inside the hip join pulling on the pelvis and the pelvas is tat a wax it is really it is really is fastening it is one my favorite things about how the body works is how it interconnected it is and how one little thing somewhere cuses reprecutions somewhere else and the easiest way to find out what your problem is is to say a cay i know where my syntim is but y got to find someone who can help me find the source somewhere else because it is ging to be usually either above or below mostly usually below caus it usually translates up the connatty chain but usually is gan to be below on where the real source is up people with low back pain usually have hip issues weakness is tightness is flexibility o issues it is almost always below w get to really high performance athletics thoug it it almost works the other way where we have pictures who cannot a me i amalways fasctening by guides that have a a tommy john issues sealing their elbow right pitctures if you cannot externally rotate the shoulder av we taught about again the ability get your shoulder back and extrotation wol your arm has to get to a sertain position for release of the baseball and if it cannot get there you cannot extrotver to the shoulder to get there then the elbow has to sort of tork more in order to allow the arm to get back further and it will try to take some of that motion from a joints us not rely again another hint another hinstroy really capable doing that strutch a stress that media lelbow ligament to get a little bit further back because the shoulders not work and and that just ultimatly place ta stra in the elbow when you see guy that has a pain that floats around a picture that floats around or arm all that is is sort of this balance of conpensation once his shoulder elbowstour turtain then he cannot do the get the rain the o the range from the elbow he tries tho digg able it further back and textor otation and then the retur cuff gets inflame and then he feels that is inflame i thet by the way of during that time period take some the strain out the elbows to the ebow feels better then he decides o can now i got the extr rotation but i'v getn too much of that ni star strain in the elbow again and then keeps goin thro the cycle your body is very smart and it is good a conpensat every single time is going to find the conpesation but there is no guarantee to that coversation does not leave you with a wholehost of other issues yet's fascinating in another lifetime i would gone a ben a pete although it sounds the community of among e's ot lines at ao it it liste the ler we are tvereopple but it is likeyes scientists and ner scientistic and gettinto pretty intense battles in coming from the academic community not t the eticett is different on line because i was say you mighthinking person people would probably behave of it it a only your hand in said hellow ye take your hand an say hellow and and and there is also it luk ou i'll just be very direct about this theyre a lot of people on line for whom they are only content is pointing out the a misunderstandings or alleged flaws of other people toe's that it were it is the bulk of their identyas we to me a sort of a sad existence but there is always more to gain by thing about what is possible what is new ind what is good but to each their own de mise or win i me question questioning what is out there is help sure and almost great it actually pars conversation a but as you say some people's existence is solely to fine things to ye nagabout and and not actually with the goald being to advance anything but rather just to yet in the world of science being sceptical but not syntical is is encouraged but i was say that the longer that somebody is in a career path it certainly in science for medicine and they realize how hard it is to ou a to do very studies once they publish a few studies generally they the sort of a get a a better understanding of how how the various things are done in any case am a another along the lines of a pain and pain relief and misunderstandings about the origins of pain in the body a one of the great a tools that i a picked up from your content which is benefit i knowin a huge number of peoples i think i used to hold a weights sometimes in the in the tips of my fingers as host in the meat of the palm of my hands and i had elbow pane and alws thought that i felt it most ontrysep exercises and pushing exercise and i thought i was doing those exercise as wrong turns out i toward the end of my pull ups or my bysep work i was letting the weight or the bar driftinto my finger tips and the mere am shift to making sure that my knuckles were well over the bar or that the weight was really in the meat of my palms has completely amiliorated that for reasons that you point out and maybeyou could share with us why that is am yet this kind of finger pull exercise you yusualy wene soce us pull my finger its a mettls or mente scool jo ulitl this s a push your er i writ a y thi thea this is fassing that that this is a because it just shows again how intricate the body is and how respons ofer over response if it can be to something little and yow what you are talking about is that when you grip a bar where there it be through a curl or whether bein this is mostly pulling exercises because the tendency for the bars can be to fall out of your hand not with e pushing exercise where its countof you you are our pushing your and into the barso on he bench press si a that bar can drift just by gravity weu went doing this thing or fatigue of the the hand grip strength canstart to drift further away towards the the distal digits right through those through those last couple knuckles that we have on our hands and though our hand can still hold it there a the muscles are not equipped to handle those types of loads and that can started a very i i ling u tay light but it can start it dumbbell wight forty pounds thirty pounds yo even twenty five pounds or some depening upon ther over all strength levels but then we used tart to apply it to something your body weight with a chin up i cossess natural for the bard of somewhat kind of float down towards your finger tips in it actually is a little easier to perform the exercise with that sort of false grip little hook grip at the end because you are not get engaged the forarms into the exercise you nott r start pulling down but at the same time while it could help you to per form them better by getting the back more activated if you have weakness in these muscles cause not is not a thing that happens that it it is not one of those upright road tight things where i think thes is hat happening to everybody this is happening to people that havies in herent weakness is in this in this a in in this these muscles you or or havng done enough of the gripping in the for in in the meat of the hand for long enough but it starts to put that stress on these muscles tare il equipp to do this and it to handle this an it starts to is particularly on that forth finger which is part of the muscle we call the f ts o flexilti a torem that it is just too much for to handle an that comes all the way down an meets right at the medial elbel round that spot that you can say feels some of the nife thing you right in the middle in that meatle elbow and in medial epicondolitus or they call it galfer's elbow it is something that a lot of us deal within the gim it is one of the most common and flammatory conditions people get from the gim and it all comes from this positioning of the dumbbell or barbell or hand on a pull a bar overtime the easiest thing to do is just grip deeper that what you are doing is you are using oye more leverage from the palm to in capsol ate the bar or the dumbbeller wouldever an you are not putting that pressure really distily right on that last dich it because that is where the that afts muscle is most strained you you are just almost telimiting that from the equation and in in it is one was exercises that the load can exceed its capacity pretty quickly that eal t it maybe its only cabae f handling thirty pounds and then we you are doing a chin up any goes in it drift far that it is now yua say youre two undred pound guy you have got and say a hundred pounds through one arm in a undred pounds this is simple simplified mat that ovesly is offset by other muscles but hundred pounds tho one arm hundred pounds there a hundred pounds off of a muscle it can handle thirty is not in to take many repetitions to strain it and you are ging to feel that maybe by the time that sets over or certainly by the time that work outs over the next day you wake up you have got that notable staving pain whenever some one feels that you the best thing would be to determine oca what exercise whet i doing that were pulling and where the bar could have drifted deeper ther into the further from the me to my palm into my fingers an figur out a way that deepen that grip when that happens though the best thing to do woul most of these inflammatory conditions is not do any of that stuff for a little while not ever just for a little while there is always things that you can do around it i'm not saying ever do i say do not go to the jim or do not find something you can do but i'm saying tht particular exercise that you feel the pain on while you are doing it never smart idea to do that exercise when it is in flained if you ere doing exercise and it hurts you problish into the exercise because another youn yo reason ot for the very buildy of exercisean there there is many other options that you can do thate will train similar muscles ore even the same motion and not cause that stress i mean a cable a cable curl would be much easier to do that on then let us say a chin up wher you do not have the control over the weight you do by moving a pin on a stack i think that that that is a common thing that people find in the best thing to do is just figure out how greep how deeper you gripin tat baring yourn to find that all my got any realize that because it was just even though you o much started that in a g an position in a it drift away as you go ya i tha think thets al ways happening me and am very conscious of this now andgain for me it is i have not had tis elble pan at all that is gree nough t very fortune again deto gratitude toou never i thought of some rowl in my elbow exically a and o thought it maybe tennis all by oin play tennis and a there you go m other aspects of recovery in ver veriables for recovery a i think i you and i both put out content about the use of cold and i think we can sumriseit by saying yet does seem cold water immersion immediately after i perchaffer your strain t work outs might be prom but a cold showers poan ot apom what abut heat do you do you personally use heat and cold a sonas hot tha you hot bats a hot compress is you and by you i mean you personally and and affleats that you coach wor people that you coach what your thoughts on the use of heat and wore cor a we i think it might just be aninherited practice from the days of utraindards of of a sense tha babe ruth but we we in basebale we used a lot of cold following performance just because the the idea would be there there is some especially pictures and there is some inflammation a that is abnormal o the arm is not really desing to do what they do especially at the at the speed that they move it and everything else we would use you ice as a pretty standard practice after that a but not now lot a heat in when you use lot a heat in of course from the recovery ot er tha the healing aspect that actually becomes rather a personal preference they have found now a after let' say the first twelve to twenty four hours where you really trying to control inflammation of what might be an injury but then it then it can kind of shift to personal preference because the hea can bring blood to the area also and hen the yotha the the cold has its sort of anti a inflammatory effects selece there is that there is a balance between which one's working better for you there isale no standard any more for heat or cold in that way but from a standpoint of post o work out healthy statis a i have not use much heat or cold in terms of what we do w youon ly cover the topic of the cold showers and to try to dispel the midth of te a even people saying that there is trying to stocstron releases and in all kinds of stuff that listent we heare all kinds of things caus people wat i think the idea just turning the water cold and being in it for thirty seconds and then all the sudden magically growing three times your size is intriguing ot of people and they and that is why they aske these questions cane leke i'l be a hel lot easier than i to gier in training hard but i got always fascinated by some of the stuff that that you talk about fact we start a talk about some of the stuff in terms of cooling and what it can do on performance and thatis there there is some ontapped territory there that i think you are you are finding out about yat who we fun would be to bring the cool mit tecnology from stamper this is crag hel at my collye creg heller s a labbit tampers one really important in a amazing work in this area but then i moved on to some other things he is also working on gouncind jerman he works on a number of other really important topics a scing tis often do a but i have a access to the schoolmit technology no relationship to the company by the way wed love to come out to your facility and and a we can do the blind a ripe studies and blue blocker xaxactly and im and see how that goes i in in with somebody advance as advanced trained to you im the that is pry best ing to a content for the future im ye i think heat and coldar are kind of staples in the peaty world an night does see my people use them i'm slightly differently but they are they are kind of the macker new treants of of recovery there along along a sleep im i woud i do have a question about precision of record keeping do you keep a training journal it you recommend people keep training journals are you nauradically fixed to cadents of movement and are you looking at the you have a buzz er going off for night when it is ninety seconds rest as it ninety seconds rest i confess i've my slow work outs and my faster work outs im and they scale with when i'm training heavier with longer rest or whether not maybe midway through a work out or shift over to doing higher repetition lower rest this this kind of a mi ouna crude way of o keeping time but i'm not you do not will be just a con a watch the clock but i'm not nauradically fixe to the buzzer nor am i on social media during my work outs which is that shea way to really improve workouseas to just not be on social media ii cannot claim them not guilty of that sometimes i am on social media ut sometimes on trying to post something whe tat's different is er it is er an it is terrestion but i meen i am i i'm not i'm not a necessarily a chain to some sort of protocal in terms of how i do i think by this wo meen doing this a long time annotoly is it some that i've done for a long time but it' it is a passion of mys an they are really enjoy i probably inherently have the ability to stick to these these a guy lines an terms of rest time a to now what i lifted yo know even six months ago on a lift and an an how it fell without journaling it but i recognize the value it has to a lot of people goes back to that whole my muscle connection idea taf we talked about in the beginning there is a lack of wariness for all aspects of training it specially maybe it is not your r interests lovely and we are talking you and i from a a a position of interest this is what we do we we enjoy just how our bodyes work in understanding how they work some people do not care th this want the end result but journalling in keeping track of that raises a wareness to realike all mi got ii i have been on the a istogrand for last seven minutes and i'll suppose to be back at my next set and ninety seconds there is a training effect of that an icu you you if your trainin for metabolic overload you have blown that opportunity because you have yo your rest time was very sa was very important to that pro to call working as it should if you are training for strength may be the extra few minutes does not matter much when you get back ond the mar you might find i mean you might find that it is a better response for your body to rest even longer than you have been told free four minutes five minutes and that way may be at helps but i think that anything you can do to increase your wareness of your performance and also give yourself some objective goal whenever we have an objective goal as loties you'r tas she obtain it when you are just there to get a pump an you are just there to lift how you feel that day you have to be incredibly discipline in all other aspects of your work out in order to make that effective and i ad i've done that too i've actually been able to do that too but i gan the level uof repetitions i've accumulated over the course of my life in the in the amount that it that i you'l read about this stuffin i'm i think i'm able to get away with that but but i think more often than not what i'm doing is not jouraling but jurn at jurling in my head exactly what i think people should be doing in that is getting a specific effect from what you are trying to do it is not haphazard you want to get a specific effect just any other experiment that you doin you do not experiment on your own body with your own ways which to me is one the most impowering thing someone can ever do when they get bitten by the bug for you exercising and in training and a ilec to youse wore training ins rather than exercise as a purpose behind it for when they get bit n by that training bug and they start to see actual changes and results youm powering that is cas we cannot cannot we cannot really control that many things in our life unfortunately ans there is some things that happen to us that we really wish never happen and those are not something that we can do anthing about but this is one thing that we can do our best towe cannot avoid disease entirely we cannot prediclor in a die we cannot yo do those things but we can certainly decide to show into the gim that day and get a work out in or go for run or do something and by doing that you are giving yourself i think the better chance of a higher call your life anything you can do to increase your wareness of it and keep you on track with that is i'm adorsing fully could not a gree more i could not agree more the there is a topmak it of a dreaded topic what i thinks an important one in that is te topic of nutrition and rather they gan into specific meal programms which yo would take take hours and en probably would not even manage to scratch the surface even with ours i we could talk about principles around nutrition whater sort of the sthemes that you think people should keep in mind i nwenting about how to eat generally and pre training and post training are two particularly sensitive times for most or times to people want to know all ot about yo what should they eat before training or can they train fast age which shouldthey eat afterwards but yiution general what eathing ere some some axiums of of of nutrition that that really hold and i ask us i of because not because the is a lot of debate about this but because yubeen around this face a long time an and you seem what works for you obviously but for other people to what tends to work what tends not to work and em ow shall we think about nutrition i mean lt you you'v touched onat bit but hem nutrition can' be a touchy subject for people and in i understand where that comes from my i've talked about before the there is a dogmatic tendency to to nutricion and there is a reason for because it is an area that people struggle with more than anything else and the reason why people struggle with nutrition is because the commitment is extremely high you could start to work out for agram in actually get to the gim three to five times a week that is five hours based on how you and i were discussing it before well what about the other twenty three hours of each of those days there is opportunity to eat in correctly or unhealthily every one of those hours people wake up in the mildl and lih to go eat you klike there are there are things that you can do that can cause amazing amounts of damage o to your longevity in the twenty three hours not the one hour the twenty three hours when people finally figure out of away to make that work for them it is very passionate and i understand their passion i do i've put out my approach my approach is i've always been sort of a low sugar low work fat guy i've made the mistake of going no fat years ago and i paid for it i was likin college and youl back in the day we are the same age we read all the magazines and our that was what we havew have 't er not then we were we were reading magazines and the recommendo path was to go low fat o it helps you to become i pol coloric very easily because the density of the cut callories yon a gram of fat verses a gram of carbohydrates of protine is nine verses for for the carves an protine if you are cutting out grams of fat on a daily basis you are quickly cutting out callories that allows you to get leaner well of course as everything i mean i' if little is good thand a lot is better i would cut all of them out or almost all of them and at the age of twenty to twenty one ilike standing at a a stop i up it universily connecticut waiting for the tram to come and bring me to campas and i could not even open my eyes because the light was blinding to me it was normal sunlight it was blinded to me the fotol sensitivity i had learning later on after a few more courses that i took there and biology you knw how how r necessary fat was for the development of healthy a sells i i realize wha was going on o enothing at other stuff skin was bad hair was fallen out all kinds of stuffs i i i think that the approach to decreasing fat 's not excessive yooun because again how colorically dence it could be in having lower sugar i don i'm o a firm believer and sugar is really pretty toxic and o something that we would all do better getting rid of a lot of it o that is the best approach for i believe again in my opinion personally for the over all big picture because though the people can take exclusionary approaches to natrition in taking carbs out or eating only fats and proteines or again i'm not saying it does not work for you and if it is the first thing that actually allowed you to gain control of you natrition to the pont reactully sel resultsn't got to a healthier weight then i always say then do it then do it but just make sure something you can do forever and does not bring upon other reprecustions but i think that non exclusionary approaches to diets are the the most sustainable for the rest of your life and when i and all i'm iterested in from a natricia standpoints something as sustainable when i preach what i preach up been doin this since i was fifteen fourteen yo people sayli has he get ripped has yo ge i have been doing this for fort since for how many years thirty thirty years thretin clinin low sugar ye thirty years you knw and in the beginning it was a slow ship i had to make wheres i went from the worst die in the whole world i was even when iwas fourteen years oll my breakfast was i thought about the sommin times but enemens i would eat enemins do not us and in those long road eaote oster of ye an from en took the whole out of the dona ye a why would you why would you deleat the mittleona to o the crum the crum dona there i o i would ei cannot dottin my i do not sugar very much over the years i've lost my appetite for sugar i hase dog by the engimin as i can letally smell and tit us the frosting and to me now it is discussing about then it might have been appetite would probably have really good information on this but my ability to actually remember i knowtheyve said smell is very ainvoking of memories hav it there is a smell is unlike the other senses as there is a dedirect ling literally from our sense of smell to the memory centers of the brain it does not have to go through any intermediate stationtha my ability to actually recall exact taste of all the stufp that eas to love is enough to satisfy me to not to not engage in those things now is crazy that is i i almost get my fill to remembering cause these strong senses of a memory of what it was as odd ise to taste look at that is got i had it that an tas yet a well that is that is we know the nermodulator there that is dopening your ability get the the dopeing release from the thought of somebody nos or people when they get that dopeming release i cause is a a triggering of the desire from morn or ry people thin of dopening is pleasure doening it that there is a book great book called the molecule of more i did not write the book unfortunately but some one else did and it is a great book and it is really bout dope mean we think it is about pleasure but it establishes crang otill you are able to satisfy that and it it is a very adapt o thing for you because you are indeed very lean ye and that is one of your kind of hall mark things and you as a professional who does this in the public space that is important when people are out theire toing out getting lean or i look at them an you mit may be you need tof do the protocolphs a it is a huge advantage but ye i think that am it sounds you cultivated practices around avoiding certain things yes yet i mean but not you avoiding certain things that i think are easily avoided if you realize that the ino think to we ave enough science and literature out there to prove that the the altered path is a better path o me i feel tifi if i was just doing it because i want to be lean am not quite sure it would have held for long no and we have a guess that a whose episode has been recorded for this podcast who runs and eating disorder clinick at the university pennsylvania medical school studye's been seeting disorders and erect e a o sedy and and he will go on record and obe city and he will go on record saying that these very highly palatable process high sugar foods of the sort that were talking about am do not uts and forth that they are actually dangerous write that there are elements of the way that they engage noral circuitury heas anor o surgeon that reshape the brain in dangerous ways and those are his words and i tak anemes s yea na is enemens i i think not s niments ri a yather coming o with what we do not athey cannot catch us an suri a in any case a to in terms of what you do eat howdo structure that am in terms of when you look down at a plate you done these escribe this before by the it is just a beautifully simple description cause i think alove people do not wanto to callory canting in all this and hody how should people think about what to eat yei i have what whaike call plate method and itsist it just simple cause it works for me a and and again if you are struggling with a with real eating issues these these mechanisms become i middally less effective because your having may be aver mostly triggert eating and you cannot stop at one plate i mean that you coan get the plate right but f the portions are out o control plate i plate has a dementinality oia wo vultible plates ea li a second thord plate ily right then all these things can be challenge but what i woat i say is a when you have your plate then you just simply look at it as a a a clock right and a if you just make a nine twenty on the clock one arm goes over to the nine an one of the arms goes over to twenty well then you are basically you can to take the the second largest portion of that which nn yu make the line towards twelve ofclock to and the largest portions going to be your fibris carbaydrates that is the the thiing of the green vegetables i whether be brokly or brusselsprouts sir sparagus or youknow you pickure pick your favorites those of the ones that give us alow that my cor newtrane we need there the ones that are generally yo except it as more healthy a and they are all sok in to proby the fibrer that is going to be both beneficial n turms of its in pact on insolent and all just through filling you up right and then i take the next largest portion of that and i devote that toords protine at ain's really important especially for anybody active a the more active you are the more you embark on trying to build muscle you are going to need to have proating every meal i have that and again you o were talking cleaner sources of proteen but ii'm you will never find boiled chicken on my plate i ditch those days when i was sixteen or fifteen or sixteenli i realized after reading those binable ty magazines that maybe the low fat things stuck for too long but the are the no fat things stck for too long but the boiled chicken and in a a a steam brock we thing that ended quickly for me cause ever i'm i cang to eat this for ever i'll have some sort of fish or chicken and but theyn't it will be it will be cooked in a way that is that is you a'st got maybe some sauconeters got some maybes tomato saw it is anything just just makit a lobet more palable interesting without belowing the value of the meal and then that last portions where i put my starcy carbahydrates and again that is the part that some people sa exclude them entirely cause a're not healthy er they do not work for you or ther not the on beneficial long term for me it is been a godsend and and i do think i'm most people my body craves those carbahydrates i choose things sweep potatoes which is my favor it you or i'll have a rase sir i'll have pasta im a matalians i pasta and i will have those things of not excluding them but i do not put them in the portions you ould generally find a my wife and i will go out an d will go the restaurant itsometimes because we travel a quite a bit or used to lease with baseball to there is a cheesecake factere of where you went and i love cheesecake factory but the way they structure meals is it is all rice on the bottom and al'ld te chicken on top and i mean it is a plateful of rights that you would not find me make a plate that way i'ml gog to just devote that portion on the plate to the structy carbahydrate and it gives me a little bit more responsibility an terns o portion control cause those are the foods a again probably you do not meen driven that are most easily over eaten i always asked the question haw was lost time to eight ten chicken breast at a meal you are gtting sick of it after maybe two or three but you could eat a whole hull alot of carbahydrates starchy carbahydrates because the theyre just satisfying and i think those triggers as you said to want more that is what happens right you just keep you even whe you arefeeling full you want more a and that is the biggest danger to carbahydrate if you can develop some sort of tis a plin around them am then you can still enjoy them if you cannot develop that discipline a for whatever reason than maybe they do become something to have to work yourself around or or a dopted to for neing style and as i said i'm never to the point where i'm not trying to be dogmatic an my approach i'm always tryin to say this is how i do it and i'm and i'm a believer in it just everyone else's believer in their method but i'm open to the idea that something that works for you and gets you to a aa healthier weit an a sustain ability that is good that is it is good for me you on' provided does not introintroduce other other issues yets something one can do consistently that is onliyg i picked up from you a over the years what can you do consistently and for me that also meant what when and how can i eat what can i eat consistently that will also allow me to be alert after lunch can ashon get some workd on ye a wor eat i to train fasted in the morning but i do not do any long turn fasting just happens that i'm fine doing a watering cafin in the morning and a training in the morning and then that you might forst meal afterwards it jus but i get carbidrates at night mi agen in sre rigters sort i i think carpidrates are wonderful i just do not eat them an excess to me it' i i feel when what you describe as a very rational literally balance to proach a an obvyou sey there will be variations for people whoar dealing with o becity or dibetes or i i've got friends there on the the pure carnivor thing i've friends that ar vegan and im it is always impressive to me when somebody can a stick to anything consistently be's i except when there'e ticking to just poor behavior r asnht there is nothing impressive about that awi think that that is very helpful im because i think there is for the tipical listener of this podcast eater the online content that people see the battles are very confusing the the're distracting i just people really think all that there is a right way in a wrong way and it is it sounds the way that one can am eat consistently over time that is healthy aum certainly fewer process in sugary froods i thing almost w everybody else ye amost everyone agrees on that right i i think it is at it is it is a it is calary manipulation through some other method i even even intimate fasting likking he said i that can be it is it is for people that are grazers if you are a grazer and your real problem is portion control over the course of the day but you can respond to a rule that says no you are eating between here and here that you can obey that rule well you are not going to beal the graze during the times that you might be doing additional damage a sure there is there is there is other hormonal benefits that people will talk about from that approach but from a longevity standpoint and habit forming standpoint if it is fixing the habit that you are breaking too often by eating throughout whenever you feel you walk by food am it is good the olin at works and again thet its it is it is the a people can will tell you you can probably eat whatever you want at eat as long as you are eating within those that window but i think them m responsible people whor practicioners of that will say no you still want avoid process sugar and in things that a and thas is the mechanism of eating not really a diet riht but it is it is i think that people i i hate a i hate to be as as as basic as as it sounds with thave what is for the exact reason that if it is that twenty three hour day phenomenon that is you said you are impressed it is impressive you now it is hard to control all of our behaviours in food being one of the hardest thing o a biggest temptations for people you'l learn how to control that for long and then do it day after day after day a whatever that mechanism is that works for you it is is impressive in im in an ama anama i'm i'm a believer in it i think that is the that is that is how i feel i fill it people need to be able to be given some rains to be able to the defind wa works for them well i love to eat in one of the beauties of way training as i feel i can eat plenty for my age and i'm not as lean as you are but i'm 'm a happy with weramat ca always do better hea yheer a shag of getting better a problec as am meating cleaner a as i 'll ave on a cook for me now and we no help and we liki have that i hae that tand we healthy food and were very fortune i do not think we have any package food in our home we must tartof making sour crowd at home i do not make it as she makes it welo we my wife actually she she a turn me on to a tipitactl shared with with the whole channel which was you can you can go to a we have a sto leonards around our or bic pegrociou store chain around us and they have a cater in department and the other often use for catering bi parties an yo big tubs of o of girl chicken but really good greal chicken again not the boiled chicken but your big tuvs of swee potatoes and we will thewe will get bunch of those and shall go over a shall getn thit shal sort of arrange ye of them on plates and put the plates in and i'm o cay with prepetitive eating i think more people or probably ocy with repetiveng than they think i think that wen you actually break down how many different breakfast variety ik verations you hat three to to r havesomeem lik i think when people do this more variety for dinner probably but you even there you probably t five different types of dinners to knover the course of a week er a month well if you have that ability to identify the things that you and again no plan is get a work if you'r eating stuffy do not it is nockingto work for ever nothing will you have to really enjoy were your reting as long as these these a variations of this meal or something you really enjoy in there are limitinversions of them the reproduce ability of that is simple it well take some time but if your fortune enough in our case to have somebody who can prepare it for you now that is even par out of the equation and it is it is it is it it just makes it very simple but i do think wen you tally up all the costs of medical care thatar thatars that ar spi ked by having poor nutrition and you then off set that by what it might cost you to invest in a faster stratagy this catering trick or whatever it might be you be best off figure out a way that may be realicate some of your money tha preparing this because how how por is tere long turn health an in longevity if you can figure out your nutrition issues of every one listen to spockas can figure out their nutrition issues this whole wor be different that is what o largest sources of disease and in pain ind discomfort because people realy strugglein nutrition yand is it it is a huge problem n in he ol you see it isnan epidemic in the cantry om very very serious i'm also a lot of poly processfudes are ar more expensive than healthy when you really right rake i down a even not even the better source i high quality flods are rikt there on par less than a the process foods for sure a i but couple other questions as it relates a to training a because i think that one one thing that a lot of people wonder about may be we could do this an kind of a true false a method a forsate just to get through some of these o if at riht it least at exactly am men and women should train differently the science of it will say false a the and again not not to generalize but count of the point you touched on earlier to day i do find that casually interested women in training well migrate more toward certain types of fitness kick boxing dancing low rest circuit i ye ye ye and and i think again whatever t is that you are going to engage in regularly it is what you should do physiologically know and i think if if if we can get more women to feel more comfortable in the gim performing the same exercises the same a in receiving the same strain training benefits in working on progressive overload and the and we hit the holy grail but i think that it is a it is a a big bridge that has to be gapped still because a there is just some reality to listen that there are very my wife it is a perf example this leave living a very complicated busy life a we have two young boys there their twins and her her attention and focus is there and it is she she does not do this for a living i do and if she can get a decent work out and she is happy but she is not necessarily working on her dead lift piar and i think that that would help her and serve her in the long term to work on increasing her her piare's and different lifts in building her strength progressively but iou know in her life right now it is not necessiily in the cards to have the time the focuss on that would you then discourage this other thing that she might find interesting some a boxing wha there there is a little a i remember the bran but one of those punchable boxing a stand up things heland she enjoys it and ik anything to get to get you moving is going to be preferable buut do not think that necessarily physiologically the thes difference you stare waiht train pretty young yum utii i nest around we know with my brother cause you was older in ous for yours older sauce kin nesting around a waigs probably twell or thirteen with the five pound donbo ok yet you hear that a young kid shouldnt work out with the waights i do not knowht the going a standard is now they say you shuts down long bone groth or a growth plates sh at this sort of thing i you got to young boys doorable kits by the way ye i wanter that when the things that is is very a heart worming is to see it you are in great shave ecy extremely bright your craft you love your craft i you work wit jesse who o will talk about us well am this gr which is great that there is a comerotter e there and te having great teen mates spart of a business r or to work out t is just makes better let us be honest i'm greateful to have great tea mates fror the pockats and my lab of course as well but to see your boys an your dogs and tet the whole picture you knowits its a i'm sure it has at a lot of o contoers in complexy that we do not know about in should not know about but it is a beautiful picture and e will they wait train i've seen the vidos of i wonder both of them han from the bars kis and naturals a'll telling yo ii do not wonder where they get i do not ivn inow i do not even encourage t i' not giv you the dad who sit in there a say let us go somewher ya we are two days yere i lotk in notking to do that but they they have aa natural interest in the jim they to sometimes to be out with daddy the come out there and i i of the two of us my wife and i will be the one who has a little bit more of a longer lease to let them explore things cause i was a a done me at times to and figured out best through the mistakes i erinjury e got did not norsince we call that one travel lern ver now whant o these guies rbe masters of one tro learning because o no ther'll go grab yeoht the the bars of my the handles of my jammer thens there at lower level tor them and there is swining around or do not pull ups ot at naturally uncoach nothing from me am onill walk up to a tet live bar stand over an naturally never saw me do it stands over there liscaus risly a tries to pull itso there is at there is a deafily an inclination to liking the jim and i will fully support that but of course ayou know body it will be good for quettl i what agt you think is reasonable for kis to start exploring a non body weight a yo think around thirteen i thing arout thirteen once pubity i think it' kay to start to am cause there is much i even say for people that ae later an age who are just starting out learn with your oenbody wi first tus plenty of resistance to be had by learning how to command your body in space if you have never traine before you going to get very stimulated by doing lunging and reverse lungeon even learning some appropriate ception around movement through space pull ups chin ups both to chemps o challenging for even people have had twenty thirty years of experience in the gim there is a lot of stimulus to be had by body way and jumping straight to dunbells or barbells is actually doing yourself at to service you can learn better command of your body in space we go back to the bigger lives a you are going to have at easier time sort of progressively loading them in building up that tfoundation of strength i'm not saying that you have to become a master calostacs applyc before you can touch of barbell that't not even true i'm just saying there is much capacity kids ore to be doing this anyway really just if you look at general play they are jumping thy are lunging they are cliving they are pulling i that is what they do an know a why i do not know where the avoidingsof structure training is for younger kids again pro bi their using bodywaight may be a you less bolistic movements sor something that you things tare in th er or certainly overloaded movements a i thnkg we shan ncourage kids to do more there is a lot of a obisian an kids on the rise also and that is incredibly the odisconcerting to me i think in im and i hope it does not come from the advice of some that say will wait until your older to start doing something that is a way worse traided off han then then engaging something smart now we see get kicked out of the house when wng youre kid totally my moma kick us out i o o i ta huge pack of boys a live on my street but we get kicked out side i wd live long y r not alout in th i no tell of im there re vidio games of course but we were wewere kicked out of the house we had ti furst to escape wording socker and then we we would find our trouble i a am post training nutrition were the same age a years ago i sort of neuradic about the idea that i had to injust a certain amount of carbohidrates amproachings within two hours than it was ninety minutes of trainin i confess i get if i traind hard sometime by the resistance training not the running but the resistance training you sixty to ninety minutes later unreally hungry but ther're been das when i just skipin then the hunger passes in the later i eat i eat more i mighty twice as much later o ov that tat us the wast sometimes cat ualls go but what are your thoughts an terms of the the nutrician sins the train the training related effects of a the post training meal is it something that you try to to get is it something you think people should pay attention to a that that science is actually probably been the the one that is change the most in my lifetime honestly because i i i gain were the same age and i was afalling for the sayng a trap you were i would really efolkistily i'm i'ms i'm risking speeding tickets driving home from the gim no ge ger i gotter in th bolic window you knowi i i did all tha i really did yo but a thankfully that is been sort of debunct an in your body it is not just rushing through these certain periods of time to you to lives the new trices in our bodybure able to particion them and use them over along much greater duration up to now ther' saying y of three to four hours after training five hours up to train you gun still see the unthe benefits of of replenishment alla that is just i think there is a consistency element to it am that just utilizing a postwork out window or a postwork out meal even wf its within two hours or one out is just in grining the habit of saying lisand i just did this activity and now want a replenish some of what i lost the energy that i used to perform the other the exercise that i did and just getting into the rutine knowing that the the engine is ultimately fed by what we put in it and the concept of replenishing the fuel lost is still a concept that i think again different in mechanism but still in porting in terms of fueling yu over all performance the other the the prework out period of time gives us a chance to actually have a longer window because of that if those neutrians er are obtained prework out it is not their goin in that hour that youv trained there is still there in available for your body use you i think it is importan to get one of the two we on't writer at least make sure you are youre consistently of it a ahaving one or the two or you might risk going through all these periods of of having no nutrition to support your efforts not only we work outspotentially supper and turns to the output but then you are also not providing your boding any ability to capitalize on on a and opportunity to feet it and refuel and recover im i'm not very dogmatic about what specifically to to eat pree or post woon't work out but i do think you should have protene a surrounding youre your training whether that be head of time or after proacine could be a little bit hard to digest for some people if you do that prework out in then your finding your work out swogging because you do not feel good tan sonly you put that after your meal but this whole concept of the urgency of time as thankfully been removed an we can just learn to eat a little bit more a mo responsibly in drive more responsibly were not yoknow trying to rush home from the gimmin risk yon killing people on the way i i think i think it is a but i think it is great because i think that that was something that just show cases of belief that people had for long that has since been proving to be not that important and there is it there is a there is a tip of the cap towards research in a good way whereits er i i think we could all agree that this is not necessarily true any more am and look ot yourself and say oh my got i did that off i i bit thatlont ol fin a thinker but a but then realize that canit we could always make a change and the good thing about nutrition is those changes can happen the very next time you go toe owing you will suc to see the benefits of that i'm a i'm i'm not a beg believer in that strict approach to pre or post work out am mn even as far as prework out supplements a lo people do not take a lo people do not hem thay'n't take them they do not they are not necessarily even being used as the nunutritive side of the prework out they are just more new use to fuel the work out om stom for me it is a water in ofm some form of cafine ye i mean it is it whatever yu know again i think it is important i do thing is important to maintain a high level atou't put if youre prework inetrician requires a stimula nor to help you do that or if you prerork nutrition is causing you to have a harder time the train because your feeling full or stomach take or something else than n that that is not achieving what u trying to do the ultimate gol is to still be able perform at the highest level whaever you nutricion is require til li is still do that that is py the most important factor of all of it rigt i love the very clear and rational proach do not injest anything right before your work out or near youre work out that is going to make your work out worse an even han it is simple and yet you do not hear thats because i think people think o they must have a prework at they must have a putoe again i oven if the're the the benefits that are to be had from whatever's being suggested is goin to be easily offset by the fact that you cannot perform at an out put capable of driving any change that that would pi promustngait the fact that the'r know there is no you are not out weighing those benefits of whatever nutrutr to reproachi tug but ens to struggling for your work out o for me the best prework out is a good night sleep hidration caffine music eomi they wors formerlyan iworks and the pos where i do i do find i get quite hungry ing wone you quite a bit morin and ellas a natural response the body's going to in most people want to do that and i think it should be fet i work out as youy again lot of my postings on ister gram will happin at ten ofclock at night ten thirty at nine eleven a night as i am actually training there and that is for i'm taking those little breaks in between satstactually film or post something but lik i then go inside aht dinner i'm eating at eleven ofclock at night no it is not necessarily ideal on that reconmending thatas a tool for anybody i think it dispells one thing i've never been a believer and can it carves after six no i makes in o sense to me you are sast on all the new alll the sine of matabolism that i've seen riness i think as long as you can sorve napping i talk to mat walker one of the great sleep researchers wrote why we sleep et ceterae an as is dont parcasts about sleep tremendous research r public communicator about sleep en he said your naps are fine provided they do not interrupt your ability to sleep well at night right simple o me when sleep from eight to nine p m and then go to bed at midnight and not a problem other you wll take a thirty menute nap after lunch and they cannot sleep at night i simthing witcaffines ole different because nat would argue the architecture of sleep can be distrrupted et cetera but you can eat dinner late e ar carbhydrate sleep i should need carbidrates at night in order to be able to sleep whenever i've done a low carbohidrate type regimen in the evening i have a hark time falling sleep on is to alert eands i eat carbidrates in it an evening to restore licagin but all s o in order to make sure that i can fall slee i i actually can k again ovosslyt's alreadylate at night by time wem don eating but i could fall asleep within five ten minutes of finishing my meal yo because i i i do think that they have that same effect on me u but i'm never by ot i'm not bothered by the feeling of fullness i'm not i'm no unable to sleep because of feeling a fullness am but i do i i do the fact that i i feel as if i'm at least replenishing what was lost through my hard training and i do to back it up with a a dinner i do not need to eat smaller amount some people cannot have that mu i will say after a hard leg work out i do not have the same appetite that i do after less say an opper body work out it can really destruct my my whole feeling of o of well be you want to eat less after youtrain your lege i do yet a well im i'm the opposite i no caus i just feeli i could eel sick to my stomach ye you are clearly training hardihave seenouati tant you do train very untal yet yew ye i i ma supportn i may not think that again it is that traide off between if you are not going to train for a long perio of time im then you are gin to want a train harder and again i i actually feel contrary to what people might think as you age you are better off training harder for shorter perio of time am neel it it is always within the the realm of of of safe training man i think that is what i i to thing this i bring to the table an approach that smarter i can train harder not doing the dumb things i did when i was a kid am an with that ynow traide off being a harder trainer im i think i it the results that i want because i'm able to really push it and then back off and and again that ththe meal feels a almost oa physiological reward for the hard effort i put ing the jim knowing tham i'm russle replenishing and and an setting the stage for the next day to be another successful day of training net wore may be not ican time byme a times a week i i train but yei i i i think that it is im i's a lot less it is a it is a lot i could say but's lot less scientific then we want a make it and as it seems to be coming back often times the thing that works for you is really the most important thing because ultimately getting your ask and there in doing what you do is is really the thing that provides the best benefit absolutely in can there'e many things that i would say a hole march said jeff cavalier but one one of them is certainly consistency you make it happen youare another huge i ma consistency really is the the determinite and i and i know that that is the hardest part for people that and why people tend to look for the short cut cause consistency of the part that ye that becomes the biggest challenge but am if you could find it lessen if you could find the iomac of yo through what i'm an tryin o encourage here as i if you could find the nutrition aproach if you could find the training approach if yu coul trot find the training split if you could try all those things that encourage you to want to go the gim you are locked in at the point where o thaid you actually look forwardto going in doing o i look i i love it i look for a timin it is it is actually this morning who went abyu ar one of our tee mentiuol the podcast i i got work out and half way through igus turng when i said i'm never forgure out why that feels good but it feels good i just i really enjoy it and it let us and i love to eat and it less me eat and i love the way t makes yo feel afterward i do not understand this consept of not in joing the jim cardiaas a little different i i always loathe the first ten or twenty minutes of tet dog i mildly loath the middle third and by the end i think this is the greatesthing ever on onlo doin all right a timand then that feeling evaporates ther the next time i corse any remember either began exactlyi i i a i thiyk if people could if if if we had one gift we could give to everybody would be the love of fitness for if they could be bestowed the love of fitness o would change the entire world but i think whel you hear things this that he that will work and that will work too and that this will work to you rather than the dogmatic one way only approach a which could beecome discouraging for people a then i think it becomes alo it up lifting i've never tried that i've actually never tried a tota by splitter never tried he know that style of eating it becomes encouraging ly my why explore and thet you might finally get locked in have really this and then you are often run let us a whaut i enjoy about your content i we would be remiss if we did not am disbriefly discuss a jesse am one of the great pleasures from me and in watching your content and learning from it over the ears as that you took on a you decide to menter somebody am jesse and there is a there some poking fon back and forth between the two of you which is very amusing but have to say it inspired me to do something a early on endeveloping this podcast as i have a a young in turn who am has helped me with some of the research and he is a buttind he is interest in science he is about to go off to college but he els got really into fitness we watch the it he as of you guise he was helping me get the instragram content out early on and one thing that as just it was such a pleasure to be able to pass along knowledge and and of course i'm learning from him the ises is always the way it work i learn what ir teaching we learne from students a but it is been great to see jesse's progress that is amazing gettin meet him in person a just now and and i he is he has grown he is changed physically and and i think that you mention a love of fitness i think that in it one of the best ways to be consistent is to take on the responsibility of teaching others one s one has proficiency and i think am may you just tell us a lopit about how that is going how owas jesse doing and am were were where does he nee o more work whereis he thriving a i'm impressed by the progress will we have be physically we can have is se see thethethe change s in the list of things to work on or is is immense is long for him to contain im prove but no acte in reality jesse the story of jesse was that i do jesse prior a starting even atlan acts and admire i fact to think the unnything is the very first ovidio that was ever posted on my channel was o vidio that he shot as i do not know a thirteen year old or something and i think he you just filmed this first second i was over there to yo to training a members of the family a he then off went off the college when in to film realize he had much a greenor pastures that athle next instead of a become the next to crsasir something and he decided to come a work with me an and hou'v the expectations in the beginning were just to edividios or just to a you help with verious aspects of of my day to day that i do not think i was yoo equipped tably handle and grow the business any more am thend you knowt look it by by virtue of being in that environment there is an interest i think if i worked in the jim i might become interested in working out and though bot min is not a commercial jim its sitting right behind my office hekow a window am there became an interest in oneon to work out a little bit and it was not even an intentional experiment yeo to put jesse there i just ot thought that he is a very likable person he has a very funny personality he is also the every man he know in some ways as i'm sure maybe you experience sometimes i'm the guy that thisist comes naturally for me is what people will say this is what you do for a living than this is what you there is at there is an element of disconnect in terms of the relate ability because i do do this for a living i cannot deny that i do work with professional athlete selee there is a level of interest in this above im beyond but for him hes tust the kid who wants to train maybe if he trolls out of bed before eleven i m a and does not have a date on friday night but that is the guiverybody coan relate to and watching him transform am and i love the fact that even the interests level yw wa was up and down lie it was not consistent for him because he was part interested and thet may be not is for three months and that interested in a and i never pushed it on him as this is again this was no orchastrate experiment for me it was just if you want to do this than do this and also from a standpointed am lending my help er expert tiuse to him i said with my son i'll not get is force on him but id't will not do that anybody i do not think that that is o evergan spark that desire for long term y adoption he got more interested hes started a learn more about it he watches ovidos that were filming he films of veos that were filming and he is learning through what i'm saying he is becoming more of a student of the field and i i have to say his knowledge in the field has grown with the the growth of his physique and he is put in te practice of the things that i say hes puin practice somethings he hears other places and he wins op yow improving as he goes and he wants of startin to love this he yow never thought he would am but it is great to see anybody grow and whether that be physically or the be emotionally o r ther be just and in their career its great to see somebody gro o and i i to tease him a funny aadmission here there are times whend the jabs thati will throw at him are something that we might know ahead of time what i'm going to say to him a people will say you are mean to him i cannot believe it youre getat abusive an id honestly wel laugh after it is over it is good for good t course but but h re touger than he looks as what you say he is novernent looks blany i looks penn ylife ni he is got the big beard hes a he is looks more manly than i o i cannot grow beard iido not i mean believe he is tha he is tolly alfa and im quickly becoming the second the second star of this show but he is deafinly a a contributed and people enjoy his presence for sure e i certainly do and i think that a yu you point out he is a kind of a proxy and a templet for for everybody we can relate to him yes i'm even not traine for many years that it it is been a struggle and youtrough graduat school postock you kow it made it happen one way or another but with more or less attention and i admittedly through wit yu know waxing waning levels of a motivation although a youunfortunate that do enjoy it what i think is nice about it to is that it is it it is a realistic expectation that we said i think you knowther as youre your show casing what the journey actually looks and he is been on the journey for again you devotedly for let say to last yere an a half but on the journey for five years if i could make the gains that he did starting when ice train started training at theyon fourteen fifteen and your stand hig bu twenty you are going to have the strength levels he does the physique that he does the knowledge tht you have gain that seems the blink of an eye now looking back at forty sicx years old in holy colic i think it took me to wenty years seo fifteen twenty years he ought to just even start to get into a groove for him to do it at in a period of five years it does not seem long wors there is people that will criticize his journey always to taken long it soli ti such an instant gratification ye othet people seek luckily that is the minority most people are this is amazing ah but i think that it becomes very uplifting because not only is relatable but the journey it is real and people kin aand people can appreciate that this is what will happen if you actual puttin consistent hardwork and you will watch him transform go back andwatch o vidios you look it we to oftentimes throw back te vidios where he appeared as smaller cheste but also shy jessy arms cross head down not making y contact with the camera to where now he is got his own skets and intros its it is it is it is funny because the confidence with with the growth of physique came confidence to which is great soleit said pretty soon im be his world in world thetin in as thi say well on behalf of myself and all the listeners i really want to thank you a first of all for the discussion to day i learn an immense amount even though i thought i w your contan well i still learn in mence amount many things we could deploy from when to stretch how to stretch the skipping robe a duge byt nutrician dot abo he culled training regimans and what i love about all this non that you have given us is that there is a there is a backbone of logic and in some consistent themes indeed about consistency and but that the the logical backbone i think is wet we will enable people to really show up to the table and stay there ah for training consistently over time as you said the gift of fitness is an immense skiff i cannot thank you enough i i know you incredibly busy human being with kids and dogs and an a marriage nd marasers as iwas i'm happy as it will make a work as i really ive n watching stel for a while and i really i love the science of it a the way you think ah and it is he know iy i'm tis very fortunate thos it will do well i feel very gratified in hearing that nd an honour to have you here thank you much i to thank you for joining me

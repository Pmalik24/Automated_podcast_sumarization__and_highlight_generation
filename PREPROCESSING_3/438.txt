welcome to the uberman laonte science science pace to fr i mand your hubermen and om a professor of nerbology and opthemology at stamford school of medicem today we are going to discuss sugar in particular how our nervous system regulates our sugar intake and are seeking of sugar we are also going to discuss how sugar regulates our nervous system and as you will soon learn sugar really impacts oure brain end body by two main mechanismone of those mechanisms is based on the sweet taste of sugar which it self is rewarding even if you are not much of a sweet tooth i confess i'm not most people injoy sweet tastes more than bitter tastes and the sweet taste of sugar and its various forms is strongly reinforcing meaning it triggars the activation of nuron's nerve cells in the brain and body that make us want to consume more of that sweet substance incidentally sweet taste also make us want to eat more of other substances as well you may be familiar with that phenomenon now sugar also trigars mechanisms in the brain and body based on its neutritive content independent of its sweetness what that means is that the actual coloric content and the way that sugar interacts with your nervous system at a subconscious level without your awareness also impacts your craving and seeking of sugar and other foods to day we are going to discuss what happens when you injest sugar in terms of your body's reaction and your brains reaction we are lso going to talk about what happens when you do not injest enough sugar is it turns out sugar is such a powerful fuel for the brain that under conditions where people do not injest enough sugar or wherether call blood glucos which is basically blood sugar of our particular form gets too low theire nurons do not function as well that said theire conditions of very low blood sugar in which nurons confunction even better to day we are going to talk about the ins and outs the ups and downs of sugar as it relates your nervous system and by the end of this episode i'm confident thatyou have a much clear picture as to how much sugar you should be injesting whether not you should avoid sugars that your currently eating and you will certainly understand much much more about the energy and fuel sources that your brain relies on which i'm certain will allow you to make better inform choices about the foods you eat and avoid toward mental health physical health and performance before we begin i'd to emphisize that this podcast is separate fror my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desiron effort to bring zero costic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i tho thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens af let ic greens is and all in one viteman mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athleticgreens once or twice a day is that it helps me cover all of my basic neutritional eds it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which or vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called got microbiom and the ways in which the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without letic greens i get the vitemens i need the minerals i need end the probilics to support my microbiom if yof to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock cam slash hubermen and claim a special offer theu' give you fi free travel packs plus a year supply of videmend three k too thereare tonof datand ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wofre getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitemend three and k too is also important because it regulates things carevascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstock cam slash hubermen to claim the special offer of the fifree travel packs and the year supply of vitemind three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratioes of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar ov talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration end electrolytes for nerve self function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues in organ systems of the body if we have sodiu magnesium in potassium present in the proparatios all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormon systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration end that you are getting the proparatioes of electrolytes if you' to try element you can go to drink element that is eleement dok cam slash hubermen and youll get a free element sample pack with your purchase they are all delicious again if you want a try elemen you can go to element element dok cm slash hubermen ok let us talk about sugar lets talk about how sugar impacs your brain and how your brain impacts your pursuit or your avoidance of sugar let us get a few things out of the way first the first thing is that there is nothing inherently bad about sugar i know the word sugar gets a bad rap nowadays and indeed you areging to hear over and over again during the spod cast that consuming a lot of refine sugars in particular hyphroctos corn syrup is known to have a very large number of bad effects on the brain and body i do not know that there is any one that really debates that any more even if we just agree and i think we should all agree on the called calories in calories out principl rite it is a principle of thermodynamics that if we in jest more energy than we burn we are going to gainweight if w ea in jest less energy than we burn we are generally going to lose weight and if the two things are in balance ingestion and burning of energy well then we are going to maintain weight everyone agrees on that i agree on that but beyond that there are a number of ways in which particular neutriants and the case of to day's episode sugar impact the way that the brain works such that we tend to seek out more of particular neutriants for instance if we eat sugar there are too or at least two mechanisms by which we will crave more sugar think most people are aware of that experience but to day am going explain exactly how that works but also that when we injest sugar it has a bunch of different effects on the way that are nurl circuits work that can allow us to be more or less focust more or less agitated more or less happy more or less depressed in some cases to day as we explore this thing were calling sugar we are going to explore that mainly in the contect of the nervous system but also in the contects of how the nervous system regulates many many functions and behaviors that are important to all of you your abilityou think your ability to exercise your ability gain weight lose weight whatever your golls might happen to be sugar plays a critical roll in achieving those goals and in some cases if youare injesting too much of the wrong times of the wrong forms sugar can actually impede those goals in fact sugr can prevend all the right behaviors from allowing you to achieve the goals that you want to day we are going to place sugar into its proper contect the way i want a start off by doing that is to tell you a little bit of what happens when we eat and a little bit of what the brain does to respond to those events what happens when we eat well i've done an entire episode on metabolism if you are interested in the full cascade of hormonal and nurl events that occurs when we eat please check out that episode but for sake of to day's discussion let' jus take a what i call top contour view of the hormonal response to ingesting food now any time we eat that is the consequence of a number of things that happen be for we at there is a hormone in our brain and body called grellin spelled g h re e l i and grellan is a hormone that increases depending on how long its been since we ate last o case of the longer its been since we had a meal grellan levels are going to be higher and higher and higher and it essentially makes us hungry by interacting with particular nurons in an ary o the brain call the arcuat neucleas of the hypothalemus and some other areas as well the lateral hypothalmus you do not need to know the names those brainareas but if you to know them there they are grellan increases it tends to make us hungary and then when we eat typically what happens is grellan levels go down it is a very logical system now when we eat assuming that we eat carbohydrates but even if we just eat some protine and some facts we will experience a slight or in some cases a large rise in blood glucos blood glucos is simply blood sugar and the body and brain we should say particular the nervous system does'n function well if blood sugar is too high or too low as a consequence we have another hormone which is released from the pancreous which is called insolent which helps regulate the amount of glucos in the blood stream even if you were to injest and entire a cup an aight alnce cup of pure table sugar which would sendyour blood glucos very very high assuming thatyou have a normal insolent response that you are not diabetic that insolen response woitdh help clamp that blood lucos level that it did not cause damage to your brain and body because if blood sugar goes to high its actually toxic to nurans and other cells of your body can kill them off and nurons of the central nervous systemeaningthe brain and sponal cort once they are dead they do not come back your a biological systems under stand this at abiological level that is and prevent that death of cells due to high blood sugar by keeping insolent around in order to clamp blood glucos diabetics we call them type one diabets who do not make insolent have to take insolen when they eat in particular when they eat foods that raise their blood sugar specifically to avoid that neurotoxicity and the other dilitarious effects of high blood sugar ocases o grellenis a hormon that goes up the longer its beencents we have eaten ittends to stimulate hungar when we eat grellan is suppressed blood glucos typically goes up especially when we eat a carbohydrate containing meal when blood glucos goes up its regulated in the body meaning its peaks and its valleys are more less smoothd out and that glucos is sequestered it is taken away where it needs to be taken away and in certain locations its delivered to cells that the cells can use the glucos now one of the chief organs for glucos utilization is the brain nurons are tremendously metabolically active and theire preferred mode of metabolism is glucos metapolism in other words nurons basically run on sugar which is not to say that you should eat a lot of sugar as you will see to day there are states of mind em body for instance fasted states in which people report having immense amounts ofmental clarity and their blood glucos is actually quite low it is simply not the case that the more sugar that you injest the better that yourbrain will function but it is the case that for most people meaning people are not on a quitogenic or very locarbohydrate diet theyare not adapted to locarbohydrat dits that nurons in their brain and body are using glucos in order to function that is what allows tos nurons to fire electrical potentials that'hil we refer to it firing meaning sending electrical signals down their length to communicate with other nurants to illustrate just how important glucos is for brain function i'd to describe a study that just recently came out that sits on a long history of similar studies but the one that just came out is particularly in teresting now i want to point out that unless i say otherwise i am going to refer to typical diets meaning i have to believe that most people out there are injesting some starch or carbohydrate i do realize thet aure people following very low carbohydrate diets or moderately carbhydrae diets i even know theire sand foks at there on the socal carnivordet they only meat and organs may be a little fruit but iam going to assume that the vast majority of people listening in jest protines and carbohydrates unless i say qey dogenic wer i emphasize que quitosis itself which i will i'm referring to kind of typical diet where people are consuming fats protines and carbohydrates i count myself as of one such individual some point i might try the carnivorda who knows i might try of pure vigan diet who knows but for my entire life on util now i'n forty six years old ive been a proud omnivor meaning i've trite high quality as much as i can unprocessed foods i try and really avoid highly process foods but i do eat from those three macrnutraint groups protines carbohydrates and fatsan im an assume that most of you do as well the study i to emphasize recorded from nuron's nerve cells in the brain in particular in the part of the brin that responds to visual images called visual quartax and nurons in the visual quartecs are beautifully tuned as we say to particular features of what we see the primary example of this the kind of classic example is if you put a electroe next to a nuron in your visual quartecs or if we put you into an efer f am our e skin or machine which can detect neral activity and i were to show you a bunch of a just little lines in bars of light they cun be dark bars of light that coun be a light bars of light on a screen in frond of you some would be vertical sone would be horizontal some would be at forty five degrees what we would see is that some nurons respond best meaning the fire a lot of electrical activity to vertical lines other ones respond to horizontal lines and others respond to forty five degree lines and this called orientation tuning meaning because the orientational line is a cardinal classic feature of the way that your visual system is built and everything that you see whether it is a face or a dog or a cat or a landscape is built up from these very simple nuron responses in other words when you look at a face there are nurons deep in the brain that respon to faces but the only reason that those nurons can respond to those faces is because they receive signals from nurons in your visual quartex some of which respond of vertical lines some of which respond to horizontal lines and some which respond to forty five degree lines and all of those are built up in what we call a hierarchical representationas just fancy language for those are the building blocks by which you see efface and you recognize a faces an's really an amazing phenomenon happens very very fast you never notice that youre doing this but everythng is built up from these fundamental orientation uned nurons now orientation tu nurons are fundamental that they or the building blocks by which you make up all other things that you see it is the way you read it is the way that you recognized faces as i mention and everything else experimentally it is quite straightforward to measure how sharply tune one of these nurons is in other words if i were to show you a vertical line and find an nuron in your brain that response to vertical lines i could also ask whether or not that nuron fires an thy electrical activity in response to a line that is not quite vertical may be just ten degrees off vertical or twenty degrees or thirty degrees and what i eventually would find is that that nuron was orientation tune over a particular range of angles it is not only going to respond o vertical lines it is also go in respond to lines that are about ten degrees off vertical in either side but probably not much more may be twenty but usually its can be anywhere from vertical to just tilted slightly oqe in the recent experiment that was publishd in the journal nuron sell press journal excellent journal the authors asked a really interesting question they asked whether or not the sharpness of tuning the precision of orientation tuning of these nurons is dependent on blood glucos level just a cut to the chase to give you the answer what they found is that when subjects are well fed nurons that responded to vertical responded very strongly to vertical but not very much at all to other angles of what we call stimule to lines that are ten degrees are twenty degrees off if they looked at nurons that were primarily tune right that preferred horizontal lines they found the same thing oque was not something unique to vertical lines what they basicaly found was the sharpness the precision of tuning of nurons in the brain was best when subjects were fed and conversely when subjects were fasted the orientation tuning of these nurons became much broader what it meant was that a nuron that normally would onaly respond to vertical now responded to other angles of lines as well you might say well that is great right these nurons that at one point could only do one thing are now tune to other things but it is not great because what tha means is that in the fasted state your perception of the outside world is actually disstorted it is blured it is not as precise as it is when you are fed and when i say fed what i really mean is when glucost is available to nurons now for some of you may be many of you and including myself interment an fasting or some variant thereof is actually a state that i it allows me to focus for instance i as i mention before and even earlier in this pokess i tend to eat my first meal sometime around eleven a m and then i generally at my last meal i some time around eight p m plucermanus an hour on either side i'm not superstrict about an occasion i'l wake up really hungry and i'll eat something before eleven a m i'm not superstrict about this intermittan fasting thing it just seems to be how my appetite works best given my scadule et cetera in the morning i tend to be most focused and i always associate that with the fact that i was fasted i just water in some affine about ninety minutes after waking up by drink by caffine but a hydrate from the time i get up et cetera et cetera and i know a lot of other people have had the experience of being fasted in feeling lie the ave a lot of mental clarity when you are in a fasted state typically you are going to use fuels that are available to the nurons based on youre intake of food the day before may be its you are using some glikeagin may be are using some fat maybe are using some blood sugar that is derived from other storge sytes in the bod you do not actually use fat as a fuel source for nurons under typical conditions but there are ways in which protines and fats and glikagin et cetera are converted into fuel that nurons can use what is interesting about this study is that the study says that when well fed meaning when blood glucos sugar is at a properly elevated level in the blood stream it can be delivered to the brain in a way that allows nurons to work best which is really all just to underscore the point that i made earlier which is that your nervous system is extremely metabolically demanding and it loves glucos nurons love glucos the take away from the study is not that you should avoid fasting the take away from the study is that there are elements of the fasted state in particular that elevations and things epinefran and norepinefran also call the drenalin and nortrenalin that can give us this kind of clarity of mind that many people are pursuing when they fast that is cond one of the reasons a lot of people fast they the way that they feel mentally an physically but i think its only fair to point out that glucos is the preferred source of fuel for the brain and this study that i mention is one of many study is that of explored how nutritional status or blood gluco status in the brain imbody ininfluence noronal tuning in nuronal function and it really points to the fact that ultimately your brain as an organ is a glucos consuming machine now when you eat a food that food is broken down and if it contains carbohydrates going to be converted into glucose and that glucos cannot get directly into the brain as a fuel source it actually has to be carried across the calld blood brain barrier the b b b and the actual metabolism of of glucos and the delivery of the glucos to the nurons is carried out by a different cell type and its the seltype that you should all know about because its the most abundant celtype in your brain and may beven in your entire nervous system that is the called astrocyte astrocites are one of several types of glea the word glea means glu but many people have taken that name glea glu to think that oh the only thing that the asorcises are doing ir just kind of holding things together actually the aercites are involved in delivering glucos to the nurons they are critically involved in shaping your noronal function and brain plasticity the brains abilit to change in response to experience these exercises are the little waiters and waitresses bringing glucose to the nurns and the nurons are ging to do the heavy lifting that is involved in perception in behaviour in action if prior to this episode you did not already realize that glucofs blood sugar is vital to the function of your brain and other nurons of your nervous system now and for those of you that have experience the increase in mental clarity that comes after a properly timed properly composed meaning has the right maccronutrians in the right ratioes and the properly sized mul well then now you have justification for eating something in in as a way to improve the way that your brain works it turns that your brain is going to work best when it is got glucos available whether you to fast or not that is just the reality of things the same thing is also true for the nurons in your body the way that you are able to move the limbs of your body the way you are able to perform exercise or movement of any kind for that matter is because nurons called motor nurons send electrical potentials to the muscle fibrs they release a nero transmitter caled a see to colling which causes contraction of the muscle fibers and allows you to move your limbs those nurons are also very metabolically demanding especially when you are doing demanding types of physical work and that co be cycling or running or weight lifting or yogar whatever it may be those nurons require a ton of glucos if you have ever had the experience of having to think very hard about how you are generating a movement or force yourself to continue to endure in a given exercise you might have thought oh i'm running out of fuel that is why i'm getting tired it is hard to do at'sectually the case sometimes but that is not always the case one of the reasons that it fuels work is because t you are called upper motor nurons thughon the control the lower motor nurons in your sponicort which control your muscles they have to be very metabolically active it is one thing to engage in a reflective movement here you just walking around or if your running continuously but when you suddenly have to focus on what you are doing and you have to generate specific patterns of motor movement well that feels demanding because one it increases the release of a drenalin in your brain and body which makes you feel lutomie agitated in more alert but also deliberate thought deliberately controlling the way that your brain and body is moving requires more glucos uptake more energy in those very nurons and this is also why after doing a long bowt of exercise you might be tired but also if you do a boud of skill learning of any kind or if you have been reading and thinking about what your reading or if you had a intense conversation with somebody were you really forcing yourself to listen and hopefully they are listening to you too and youre rally trying to parcs what they are saying and may bou're doing that ray now and you are trying to really tract something that is work and that work requires glucos up take by nurons both in the brain and in your body now that we have establishe that glucos is the preferred source of fuel for the nervous system i to concentrate on a few of the other types of sugars that we ingest on a common basis and the impact that those have on brain function and body function i'd particularly to focus on fructos fructos of course is found in fruit is also found in the infamous high frutos corn surup which we will talk about to day it is worth pointing out that the concentrations of fructos in fruit is quite low compared to the concentrations of fructos in hifructos corn surp hifructos cornsurp is a proximately fifty per cent fructos which turns out to be normously high per centage of anything really especial when we contrast that to the concentrations of ructos in fruit fruits have other types of sugars in them as well a youw the sucros content of most fruit and fruit juices is low a although there are some fruits melin'speaches pine apples and forth they contain a li less than ten per cent or of sucros a things mangos can have a lot of sucros but typically te amount of fructos fructos i i think its the proper pronunciation that people are always correctin me fruc tos is anywhere from one per cent too about ten per cent right it is really gan a very quite a bit and many of yiow have probably heard to the calld glicemic index which is a basically a measure of how fast blood sugar rises after eating particular foods at setera were gan aset aside the glicog mace index for now we will come back to it it has some relationship to the concentrations of fructos in fruit but the point id to make is that fructos as a sugar is handled very differently in the body then is glucos but i also wone to emphasize that because the percentage of fructos in fruit is rather low especially compared to hig fructos corn surup many people have demonized fructos saying that frutos makes you fat or that fruit makes you fat if you look at the data that is not really the case the fact of the matter is that the concentrations of fructos and fruit are low that unless some one is consuming a lot of fruit or theire consuming a lot of fruit on the backdrop of a highly process diet or a die that has a lot of other stuff that they might not want to be in jesting you cannot really say that fructos is fattening i do not really think that there is any basis for saying that fructos itself is bad now high fructos corn syrup is a different issue and too much consumption of anything but fructos included where the nut comes fruit or otherwise can be a problem for the ways that it impacts the nural circuits that process sugar notchous gluctos but fructos and will illustrate those neral sricuits in a bit and will become very clear to all of you regardless of whether i have a background in biology or metabolism nutrician or otherwise why ingesting very high concentrations of fructos is not going to be a good thing for the way that your brain functions one of the key distinctions between gluctos an fructos is that fructos most likely cannot directly acess the brain it actually needs to be converted into glucos in the liver and the way that conversion occurs feeds back to a set of hormons and nurl pathways that we talked about earlier which have a lot to do with appetite in judic summerize what is now a lot of very solid data fructos and specifically fructos has the ability to reduce certain hormones and peptides in our body whose main job is to suppress grellin as you recall grellanis a hormone that increases the longer it is been since we have eaten and grellan makes us hungry by stimulating particular nerans in our hypethalemus it actually makes us really want to eat and in particular really makes us want to eat sugary and fatty foods fructos reduces the activity of the hormones that reduce grellin and the neck consequence of that is that fructos increases grellin although i and i think pretty much everyone elte there save for a few individuals agrees that calories and calories out is the fundamental principle of weightlost mate weight mainnance ar weight gain injesting fructos shifts are hormone system and as a consequence our nurl pathways within our brain the hypothalemus to be hungrier regardless of how many calories we have eaten oki now i also on o be absolutely clear this does not mean that eating an apple or eating a melon or eating in at couple of etbricots or something is going to make you hyperopagic meaning tin scon to make you just wone to eat an eatniny that is simply not the case but if you compare fructos and you compare glucos not only are they metabolize differently in the brain and body but in addition to that fructos has this impact of reducing the hormones that reduce hunger hormones and nurl circuits and fructos does have this kind of twist in its a finatype right are or its i guess if fructos had a dating profile this would be a kind of a red flag in a in that profile because fructos itself while it is actually a pretty good fuel source in in many ways and it is often packaged in things fruits which bring along fiber invitements and minerals that i think for many of us are are things that we should be eating more ofen injesting more of it can suppress the pathways that suppress hunger and as a consequence it can increase hunger current recommendations for most people are to eat more fruits and vegetables but for those of you that are trying to control your hunger ingesting a lot of fructos is probably nockingto be a good idea certainly injesting it from hyfructos corn surup is not cin to be good idea because of the enormous percentages of fructos in hyfructoscornser fifty per cent or sometimes even more but even from fruit some people will find that fruit really quenches their appetite other people will find that fruit stimulates their appetite and i suppose if your thino stimulate your appetite than in jesting more fruit might actually a be advantageous to you fructos provides a bridge for us between a particular kind of sugar hormone function in this case grelland end the hypothalemus which leads us to the next question which is what is it about sugar that makes it such an attractive thing for us why do we it much and the obvious answer that most people arrive at is well it just taste really really good but that is actually not the way it works the rewarding properties as we say of sugar whether not they come in the form of sucros or fructos or foods that increase glucos to a very high level actually is not just related to the taste of the foods that produce that elevation in gluco sucrosor fructos it is in part but that is only part of the story and the rest of the story once you understand it can actually place you in a position to much better control your sugar in take of all kinds but also your food in takin ways that can allow you to make much better choices about the foods you injest an actually at this point i should probably give a confession said today and i'll say it again and i've said it on previous pod gas that do not have much of a sweet tooth and indeed that is true i i can can pass on chocolate or ice creamer things that seems with each successive year am sweet things are less and less appealing to me of course savory foods a anything that is really afatty salty savory of those do not last long a in my presence but i way say it do not really likes sweet thing much and i do not i sweet people but i do not tend to sweet foods a which is true but there is probably one exception and that is mangoes and turns out that a mangos have the highest percentage of sugar in them in particular fructos as well as other forms of of sugars a what i do because i love mango much is i will have mangofs probably twice a week but i'll have them after some sort of resistance training or hard ron or something that because it is the case that after you exercise hard in particular exercise that is of the high intensity variety that your body is more efficient at using circulating blood sugar it is able to store that or use that for fuel and the what i'll typically do as just take the manguashe eat the peals to i know ther prolu some people gin a cringe when they hear that i find them delicious i just bite into those things apples i do not eat the pits however now i want to take us on a journey into the nervous system to explain the pathways in the brain and body that regulate our appetite for sugar keep in mind what i already told you before which is that when we injest foods ther broken down in to various components and glucos is going to be shuttled to the brain and of course to other narons and our sponalcort and elsewhere and to our muscles et cetera in order for all of those cells and organs and tissues to be able to function the fact that many sells and organs and tissues require glucos in order to function has led to a situation where you have dedicated neral machinery pieces of your brain that are almost entirely if not entirely devoted to seeking out of sugar or foods that contain sugars and to make sure that you not only seek those out but you now where those foods are and that you injest more and more and more of them and their two main ways that these nerl circuits work in fact we can say that there are two nerl circuits entirely that work in parallel and this is a common theme throughout the nervous system and that is parallel pathways parallel pathways are the ways that you can distinguish light from dark parallel pathways ofe theways that ou can distinguish high pitch sounds from low pitch sounds parallel pathways fe the ways that you can flext your muscles verses extend your muscles for instance if you move your rist closer to your shoulder your flexing your bicep and your actually inhibiting your action preventing the action of your trisep if you move your you are wrisk away from your shoulder you are essentially using your extense or your tricep and your inhibiting the activity of your bicep for every function in your body that you might think is controlled by one brain airy are one nerl circuit almost always there are two or more called parallel pathways that insure that that particular behaviour happens now in the case of sugar consumption the two parallel pathways involve one pathway related to the actual taste and the perception of sweet taste that lead not just you but every animal that we are aware of to seek more sweet containing foods the other parallel pathway is related to the nutritive component of sweet foods meaning the degree to which a given food will raise blood glucos i wont a repeat that one pathway in your brain and bodis devoted to getting you to seek out sweet tasting things that you perceive as sweet and another parallel pathway is devoted to getting you to seek out foods that lead to increases in blood glucose it just happens that the foods that lead to big increases in blood glucos typically are associated with that sweet taste now this is distinctly different then the nurl pathways that control seeking of savory foods or salty foods or spicy foods for that matter or bitter foods the sweet pathway is what we would call hard wired it exists as far as we know in every mammel that even exists in fruit flies hence fruit fly basically getting sweet stuff into the body might seem has a lot to do with the taste but it has just as much to do with the nutritive components that sweet tasting foods carry and the fact that your nervous system and many cells in your brain an body run on glucos if you re call earlier i said even if you injest ructos friuctos can be converted into glucos in the liver and i mention of course that fructos may actually work directly on the brain that still unclear for humans yon the jury still out on that w will see but the fundamental thing to understand here is that when you think you want a piece of chocolate or you think you want a piece of cake or your craving something sweet you are both craving the taste and your nurons are literally craving the neutrative components that arrive with with that taste and simply by understanding that can allow you to circumvent some of the sugar cravings that you might otherwise be a complete hopeless victim to also in this episode i will talk about ways that you can sort of undermine or short circuit these circuits if you will in order to reduce sugar cravings on a regular basis if that is your goal two parallel pathways one of the parallel pathways has to do with conscious perception animals of all kinds mice rats and humans will prefer sugary taste to non sugary taste when we eat something that taste sweet we register that sweet taste by way of sweet rerceptors literally little ports or portals of a nurons on are tongue end on our palate lot people do not realize us but thereare a lot of taste receptors on the soft palite and around the mouths on the sides of the mouths wel youare actually tasting things not just with your tongue but with your entire mouth in your palite when you injest something sweet very quickly their signal sent from those nurans in your mouth to brain areas that cause you to seek out or at least pay attention to the source and the abundance of those sweet things they literally change your perception in fact there are beautiful narrowimaging studies that show that when people injest a sugary drink their perception of images of food change very much to make those foods appear more appetizing and not just foods that contain sugar results of those studies do show that threis an increase for instance in the a perception of detail and images of ice cream after you injustice sweet drink or even t a put a hard candy into your mouth it will make you seek out sugary things more it will make sugary things look more appetizing but also other foods more appetizing i think it is important that people recognize that fact that when you have a sweet taste in your mouth or when you have tasted something sweet within your mouth i should say your perception of food has immediately shifted these are fasceneral pathways and will get into some of the brain structures in ar moment but these are fasceneral pathways that shift your entire self toward seeking more sugary stuff and more food generally does that mean that you should never injest anything sweet no certainly the'm not saying that everone as to decide for themselves what the appropriate amount of sugar in take is but i find it remarkable when people say o uno i need to get my sugar fix re i need to have my chocolater i need have a little bit of something just cannot take care of that sugar appetite because in taking care of that sugar appetite may be for the very discipline of view you can just have that one piece of chocolane its great and can relish in it but it does shift the way that you purceive other foods as well and the way it does that is through are probably if your listener of this pocas now old friend but incredible neramotulator dopami dopaming is a molecule that is released from several places in the brain there is a called meso lymbic reward pathway which is a whole set of places in th brain or circuits design to get us motivated and craving and in pursuit of things and then of course there are areas of the brain that are involved in movement that are linked up with those areas involved in motivation that makes perfect sense why would you have a brain area involved in motivation if you could actually do something with that motivation the way that your brain is designed is when there is an increase in dopamine in the musolymic reward pathway their signal sent tenare of the braing called the striatum where n a spend a libit of time today in the striatum it is got a dorsil part meaning in a upper part in a ventropartmeich means a lower part and the dopamine sent to those areas placeus places oscuse me into modes of action to pursue particular things sugar or sweet tastes i should say to be more specific have an incredibly potentability to activate dopamine release within the esolymic reward pathway this has been shown over and over and over again in animal models and in humans this is especially true i should mention through the ingestion of sweet liquids now this becomes a very important point to us a little later on when we talk about the proliferation of sodas and sweet drinks and there i even say non sugar or diet sodas we are goingto get into that elobit later the on perhaps one of the most third rail topics in a nutrition but when we ingest something sweet the perception of that sweet taste increases dopamine and the mesolymic reward pathways which then are convaye to pathways for motor behavior and in general place us into modes of focused action toward getting more of whatever was sweet again for those of yeou that are very discipline you can probably eat that pet one piece of chocolate and be just fine but if you understand the way that dopamine works what you realize is that when this dopamine pathway is triggered it tends to create not the sensation or the perception of satiety of feeling something is enough but rather to produce the sensation of wanting more as described in the episode that i hosted with my phenominal colleague from stamforet school of medicin doctor onolympkiti is an expert on a diction and dopamine pathways the dopamine circuits of the brain have what we call a pleasure pain balance and there i'm peraphra sing what doctor on alempky has said and has written about in her beautiful book dopamie nation if you have not read that book i highly recommend it whether not you have issues with a diction or people that do or you do not it is an incredibly important read especiallyif your interest in understanding motiv ated behaviors and ways to channel your behaviors in life toward healthy motif atted behaviors and make sure that you avoid some of the common pitfalls that people fall into noxious addiction but things over use of osociamedia or a wasting time in general it is a phenomenal book in that book end of course within research articles you will find evidence of this called pleasure pain balance that exists within our dopomine circuits nobody has dopamine circuits that allow them to escape this pleasure pain balance and the way this works is that any time that we engage in a behavior or we injest something that increases our levels of dopami there is a subsequent increase in the nerl circuits that control are sense of frustration pain and lack you can actually notice the phenomenon if for instance your somebody who really likes chocolate or you really something else pay attention to the way that you experience indulging in that thing if you eat that piece of chocolate and you really focus on savoring its amazing taste you will notice that it provides some quenching of your desire for lets a sweet stuff or chocolate or both but rigt as you stop experiencing that wright is that chocolate in take tapers off as you swallow it down your throat are you just pause for a second afterwards what you will notice is that your brain and body actually orient toward wanting more and that wanting of more is really the action of the narl circuits that underlie pain and are pushing your dopaomine levels back down and when these circuits go ari or i should say when people fail to control themselves within the contacts of that pleasure pain balance the typical behaviors to reach for yet another chocolate or to then look for something that will quench that desire and get dopamine levels back up now the way these pleasure pain circuits work is rediabolical cause it turns out that were you to take another piece of chocolate yes your dopomy levels would go back up but not to the same extent that they did the first fit of chocolate that you had in fact we can say that the longer it is been since you have indulged in something that you really enjoy or would the greater the dopamine you will experience when you finally engage in that behavior or indulge that thing in just that thing and the grater the dopomine increase the greater the subsequent action of those pain circuits this puts you on a very complicated ceae aw it is a very wabily precarious state to be in which is not to say you should not have a piece of chocolate is just to say that the sweet taste of sweet things in particular things that we crave very much and we wait an wait an wait and than we allow ourselves to indulge those trigger changes in our narrow chemistry and or noral circuits that place us in a very vulnerable place to either want more and more of that thing or to seek out other ways to fill that kind of emptiness that we feel or that gap awh i would love more but i'm not can allow myself more now again i'm not saying that you should not presue pleasurable things i mean this molecule dopomin exists for reason it is the frankly because of its involvement in secs and reproduction it is the reason were all here in the first place because last time i cect the only way any of us i got here was one way or another sper met egg and there was conception i still believe ther know a exceptions to that am that i'm aware of anyways that is a process or i should say the events leading up to that process typically involved dopamine ind one way or another there are exceptions to that too but you get the idea these dopoming pathways are not evil the're not bad but once you understand the way they work you can leverage them to your advantage as opposed to them leveriging you to their advantage o case when you injest something sweet you perceive that sweet taste and a cascade ensues within your brain that makes you want more of the sweet thing that is the conscious pathway for sugar perception for sweet perception now there is the second pathway the second pathway is what is called the post injestive reenforcing properties of csugar which is really just a fancy nerd speek way of saying there revents that hapen when your with in your stomach and below your conscious detection that are also driving you to seek out sweet tasting things independent of their taste and foods that increase blood glucosts independent of their taste in order to illustrate the immense power of these subconscious circuits for sugar seeking i to describe and experiment and this is just one experiment of many of dozens or more experiments done in animal models and humans which essentilly illustrate the same thing and as i describe this experiment i think you will come to understand the power of these circuits i'll provide a link to the study a in the caption the first authoris freemen ah the paper wish published in frontiers and by science but there've been others am papers in nature noro science papers and nuron selpress journals it sed of many many journals many many papers if subjects are given the choice of drinking plain water or a sweet tasting fluid their preference for the sweet tasting fluid is much much higher sweet things taste better than plain water at least for most people and certainly for animals now if for instance you take an animal which completly lacks sweet re ceptors and you can do this through some a molecular gunetic tools and gymnastics in the laboratory we call these knock out mice where you can knock out a particular receptor for sweet taste you can confirm that theres no perception of sweet things or at least no preference for sweetthings a in those animals in humans you can numb the mouth or other a pharmocologic ways that you can eliminates sweet receptors in the mouth and by doing that you people will tell i cannot taste anything sweet is just therethat you could give them ice cream you can give them pure sucros ive them table sugar and they would not be able to perceive it as sweet if you eliminate the perception of sweet tastes in the mouth and you offer people or a laboratory animals a water verses some sugar containing solution they you eliminate the preference for the for the sugary solution which tells us that the perception of sweet is important for the for the preference for sweet tasting drink this is also true for sweet tasting foods i should mention however in both animal models and in humans after about fifteen minutes subjects start preferring the sugary water even though they cannot taste that it is sweeter i to repeat that if you eliminate the ability to sense sweet to perceive sweetness in foods then you eliminate the preference for sweet beverages or sweet foods that is not surprising but if you wait about fifteen minutes the preference for the sweet beverage of the sweet food comes back now that does not mean that they can perceive the sweetness in fact you the way these experiments or done as very clever you offer people a various cups of different things or different food items and theyou just look at what they eat more over what they prefer to eat more of this experiment is crucial because what it says is that the preference for sugar containing foods is in part due to the sweetness of those foods but in part due to something else and this something else is what we call the post ingestive effect and as i mention before it took about fifteen minutes and you have actually experience this whether you realize or not this phenomenon of post ingestive rewarding properties of sweet foods meaning what happens in your body when you ingest something that increases your blood glucos very much has no doubt controlled you from the inside below your awareness this was happening to you and udin realize it heres how it works we all have nurons within our gut these narons have a name they are called nuropod cells nuropod cells were famously discovered by professor doctor iego pohorcas at duke university and these cells respond to among other things to the presence of sugar within the gut when we injest a sugary food or drink or we injest of food or drink that simplyt contains fructo sucros clucos er some other form of sugar that later through metabolism will be converted into glucos the nuropod sells are able to register the presence of those sweet or gluco stimulating foods and in response to that send electrical signals because electrical signals are the way nerons communicate up to the brain vi the called vaguest nerve the vagus nerve of course being nerve pathway famous for its roll in relaxation that is kind of the than the assomption out there that is always involved in relaxation that is not the case it is vlved in a lot of things besides relaxation but none the less these nuropod sells send electrical signals through a particular highway within the vagus to the call nodos gangleand this is a cluck cluster of ganglings just a cluster of nerons and then the nodos ganglean sends on information to the nucleus of the solitary tract the nucleus of the solitary tract is an area of the brain that we are going to talk about extensively to day it is very important for understanding sugar preference these nuripodsells also triggar activation of dopomine pathways within the mesolebic reward pathway in other words there are signals conveyed from the gut meaning stomach and intestins to the brain any time we injest sweet foods but it has nothing to do with our perception of them being sweet has everything to do with the fact that sweetness of food is almost always correlated with an ability to increase blood glucos and the net effect of this is a parallel pathway by which dopamine is increased further now the experiment that i described before of animals are humans injesting something that contain sugar but not being able to perceive its sweetness and yet after a period of time still preferring that food or drink to non sugar containing food or drinks even though they cannot distinguish their taste is dependent on these nuropod sells and related pathways what this means for you is that any time you eat something sweet that substance is actually causing eur got your stomach an your intestin where to be more precise i should say that substance is food substance is causing the nuropod sells in your stomach and intestins to send a parallel set of signals up to your brain saying eat more of that or simply eat more eat more eat more and preferably eat more sweet foods we have all heard of hidden sugars meaning the sugars that manufacturs have put into foods and disguised them with other flavors i talk about this in the episode on salt using salt to mask the taste of sweetness that people in jest more sugar that is not an accident that hidden sugars are often hidden with salt or with other flavors it is done that people will meaning you or me will want to injest more of a particular food independent of how sweet that food taste a in fact some crackers for instance chips for instance you might think oh well chips that are not sweet their salty an savory gan ni'll mention a love saltis the savory foods including certain food that love kettle chips for instance at cry not to walk by them in the grosery store i shoulld have to eat one bagell in the store and then another later the savory foods are often laid in with these hidden sugars that we cannot register as sweetness but trigger the nuropod cells which then further trigger dopaming which make us want more of them now we may be able to resist eating more of them but it makes us crave more food in general now we will talk about ways to regulate this pathway the sort intervene in this subconscious pathway but for now i'm hoping that just the understanding that we all have this pathway this is hard wired into our body could potentially allow people to better understand why is it that their cravings are intents that it is not necessarily just about the taste of that food and when you consider this in concert with the fact that we have this dopomine plain pain pleasure balance scuse me that i referred to earlier you start to realize that there re multipl mechanisms hard wired into us that make it especially hard to not eat the sweet thing or to not eat the foo that were craving and indeed that is the case we have two major accelerators is a car with two accelerators and we will talk about the braks but two ways that really get us into forward motion toward pursuing the consumption of sweet foods now if it does not alray seem diabolical enough that sweet things that we perceive as sweet make us want eat more of those because of dopamine than then send us down this pain pleasure pathway i mention earlier and the fact that we have this subconscious circuit coming from the nuropod cells and our gut that are registering the presence of sugar or glucos increasing foods in our gott an sending those signals to the brain for yet more dopomine pain pleasure challenges there is a third layer to this whole thing and that has to do with how sugar is metabolized in the brain or i should say how glucos is used without getting into two much detail some of the more beautiful studies of nurro imaging and a valuating which brain areas are active when we eat certain foods were done by doctor dain a small slab at yell university end in some of her previous work when she was elsewhere and of course by other laboratories to and they use an approach called positronomission tomography and they and others have used pet scanning as it is called positronomission tomography along with the tool called to dioxy glucos two dioxy glucos is actually involved in the procedure of seeing which brain areas are active when people eat foods or engage in other types of behaviors but the way that two dioxy glucos sometimes shorten too d g the way that it works is to block glucos up t ake from nurons and instead bring along with it a marker that one can see through imaging in other words a tool for looking at what parts of the brain are active when eating particular foods actually prevents foods such as sugar from allowing glucose to get intue particular nurons now that might seem a bad situation youd say well wait you shina understand how sugarr works in the brain and then you block the ability for a sugar glucos to a byind to or be used by these nurons because of the thing that your using for the experiment exactly it is a huge problem but it turns out to be a huge problem that led to a great insight and the great inside is this the preference for sweet tasting foods and liquids is actually blocked by to dioxy glucos what that means experimentally but also in terms o what it means for you and me in the real world is that thereis yet a third parallel pathway that is related to the use of blood sugar the use of glucos by nurons that ferther reenforces our desire to eat more sweet things and the preference for sweet foods can actually be eliminated through to dioxy glucos now i definitely do not want people going out in consuming to dioxy glucos this is a laboratory tool it is not something that you should be ingjesting us do not go look it up in tryiang get some there might be other uses for but that is not the point the point is that it is the sweet taste of sugary foods it is the signals coming from your gut from your digestive tract to your brain and it is the use of the metabolic consequences of sugary foods that our acting is a three prong push on your desire to consume more sugary foods this car analogy that used beforeawere it is some weiard car thatas too exceleries it actually has three accelerators and with three accelerators all pushing the system hard we can say while there must be something really special about this pathway n indeed there is this pathway is the quickest source of fuel for the brain and the rest of the nervous system it is the preferred source of fuel for the brain and nervous system and i realize as they say that all the the quitonise does are probably go no actually queitones of the preferred sorts oke i acknowledge that there are conditions under which you can bring your blood glucos very low and theire reasons to do that actually quitoses has been a terrifically successful treatment for a lot of forms of epilepsi in particular pidiatricep epilepsy many people do derive benefit from quitergenidit i'm not nocking heeto genadiats but if you were to look at what nurons normally prefer meaning in a typical diet regiment it would be glucos and the fact that fructos is eventually converted to glucos the fact that when we injests sucros it is eventually convert into fuel that nurans can use that is very much in the glucos pathway what you basically arrive at is the fact that your nervous system is a glucos consuming machine and you have got at least three pathways of which i have described that are pushing on your brain consciously and subconsciously to get you to seek an consume more sugar now that all sounds a pretty depressing picture tleast for those of either ar trying to reduce your sugar and take and of course we can all reduce sugar in take by way of sheer will we can not have those foods at home we can restrict ourselves from those but there are some things that we all can and perhaps should do in order to regulate these pathways such that we do not feel controlled by them but rather that we control their output and of course they are us and we are them this gets into all sorts of issues of consciousness and free will that i certainly do not want to cover in this episode but none the less i think once you understand that these circuits exist and you understand that their simple substitutions and modifications that one can make to their food in take that can work within these pathways and even by pat some of these pathways you starc to realize that you have a lot more control over sugar in take and sugar appetite than you previously thought now many of you have heard of the calle glycemic index the glyemic index is a measure of how quickly blood sugar rises after injesting particular foods and very broadly speaking we can say that there are loglycemic index foods of less than fifty five typically is the measurement or medium glycemic index foods which go from about fifty five to sixty nine and then called hyghglycemic foods which are above seventy and of course there is additional nuants related to glycemic load and many more features of the glycemic index a couple of things to understand about how the glycemic index is measured and then i'd to just briefly talk about how the glycemic index can be leveraged to short circuit some of the neural circuits that would otherwise lead us to crave and perhaps even injest sugary foods first of all measurements of glycemic indisease of food are typically made by having people injest those foods in isolation and in general we can say that any time we injest fibre and or fat lipits along with a particular food it will reduce the glycemic index of that particular food either the absolute level of blood glucos that a particular food causes or the rate at which that elevation and blood glucos occurs and this is why there are some seemingly paradox aspects to sweet stuff intrms the glycemic index for instance ice cream has the lower glycemic index provided ts i scream than includes fat which i hope it would cousats the good tasting i screm in my opinion compared to something a mangoes or table sugar right gly semic index is not something to hold holly in most cases because most people are not in jesting foods and isolation and tere's actully a lot of argument as to whether not the glycemic index as really is a vital as some people claim there is also the context in which you in jest particular foods as i mention earlier aafter i do hard training of any kind meaning training that ought to depleet glykages a hard resistance training iachally make it a point to injest some very sweet hihglycemic foods a mangoi also injestsum starches cause i'm tryn to replenish glykage animalso tranit spike my blood sugar littl bit because that can be advantageous in terms of certain strength and hyperturfrephroto calls et cetera but most etime i'm avoiding these higglycemi foods and hy sugar foods i should point that out now why am i tellin you about the glycemic index well if we zume out and take our perspective on all of this discussion about the glycemic index through the lens of the nervous system and we remind ourselves that nurons prefer glucos for energy and that all sweet things or things that we perceive a sweet but also sweet things that are injested and registered by those neuropodsells in our gut trigger the release of dopamne and trigger these neural circuits to make us want to eat more of these foods will we start o realize is that a sharp rise in blood glucos or a very high degree of elevation in blood glucos is going to be a much more potent signal then will a more moderate rise in blood glucos or a slower rise in blood glucos if we think about the analogy of three excelerators meaning three parallel nerl circuits all essentially there to get us to seek out and consume more sweet tasting and sugary foods well then the glycemic index is sort of our measurement of how hard we are pushing down or how fast we are pushing down on those three accelerators and those of you that are trying to reduce sugar in take and you want to do that through an understanding of how these neral circuits work and you want to short circuit some of the dopamine release that is caused by injesting sugary foods it can be advantageous to injest sweet foods either alone or in combination with foods that reduce glycemic indexs or reduce glycemic load that might mean making different food choices paying attention to sweet tasting foods that can satisfy sugar cravings but do not have as steep or i should say do not cause as steep arise in blood sugar or it could mean consuming other foods along with sweet foods in order to reduce the glycemic index and thereby slow or blunt the release of dopamine you might think well why woutd i want to do that i want the maximum dopamean output in response to a given sweet food i'd i do not just want the un o level ten i want the level one hundred output of dopamin but you really do not because of the pleasure paing balance that dopamine causes and in fact if we consider some of the non food substances that really push hard on these dopaming pathways we can come up with a somewhat sinister but none the less appropriate analogy the drug cocane causes very robust potent increases in dopamin within the brain and typically causes people to want to in jest more cocane because of those sharp increases in dopamie but within the category of the drug cocane their various modes of ingestion some people inhale it some peoplel will inject it interveneously some people will smoke it and those different forms of taking cocane actually impact the dopamine circuits differently and it turns out that crack cocane the smokable form of cocne rock increases dopomine to a very high degree but also very very quickly and it is the sharp rise in dopamine over time not much the absolute level of dopamine that makes crack cocane absolutely addictive sometimes you will hear sugar is crack well and that is getting a little extreme because even though i don' think the measurements have been done in the same experiment i think it is reasonable the thing that the absolute level of dopamine cause by ingesting sugar least for most people is not going to be as hi es the absolute level of dopaming cause by smoking crack course it goes without saying please do not do cocane in any form by the way it is appropriate to say that the rate of dopamine increase over time has a profound effect on how people will and if people will go on to want to pursue more of what cause that increase in dopamine what am basically saying is if you are going to injest sweet foods in order to satisfy a sweet craving injusting sweet foods for which the glycemic index is lower or in which you a justed those glicimiccindecs foods through the coingestion of fibr or may be fat might be beneficial is this justification for putting peanut butter on that piece of chocolate or for having a bowl of ice cream along with the mango that your craving in some sense yes however there is also the issue of how sweet and how delicious something taste highly palatable foods te absolutely delicious foods trigger that one nurral circuit that one accelerator that were talking about in terms of our analogy of three accelerators and the more delicious something taste within our mouth the further increase in dopamine if you really wanted to adjust your sugar cravings and you really still want to in jst some sugary foods you probably we better off combining fibre with that sugary or sweet food now i do realize that it somewhat unusual hen you prebley get some strange stares if you decided to consume brockly for ins ants along with your chocolate or with another desert that would otherwise causa a steep increase in blood sugar and has a hygglacimicandests but none the less if your goal is to blunt your sugar cravings what you really need to do is blunt that dopomine increase what were really talking about here is trying to reduce the dopomine signal that is the consequence of injesting sweet foods and we are talking about doing that through these different parallel pathways nocoust by preventing sweet taste but also by preventing the postin jestive effects of sweet foods and of course the backdrop to all of this is that most of us again most of us not all but should probably be injesting fewer refined sugars certainly there are exceptions to that but i think the bulk of data point to the fact that injesting these highly palatable certainly highly paltable highly process foods or foods that contain a lot of hyfroctos corn syrup can be really dilitarios to our health especially in kids and i'm not in sidt off a bunch of statistics you have all heard them before that for hundreds of years we injested iyou know the equivalent of a few cups are pounds of sugar per year and now people ar njesting hundreds of pounds of sugar per year the major culprit always seems to be sugary drinks meaning soft drinks and i think indeed that is the case i do want to point out the incredible work of doctor robert lustig whos a pediotric ander chronologists at universy california san francisco who is really early in the game of avoising the dangers of socled hidden sugars and highly process foods thet other people of course now talking about this his laboratory has done important work showing for instance that if hyfroctos corn syrup or even just fructos is replaced with glue costs even if the same number of calories is injested that thereare are important meaning significant reductions in typeto diabetes some of the metabolic cyndrums associate with hypros cornsyrupand on and on andon and of course there other culprits in typtudibedes there are other factors that are going to lead tob city but i think the work from lustig and others has really illustrated that we should all be trying to reduce are in take of highly refined sugars and hyprotoscorn syrup and certainly trying to reduce are in take of very sugary drinks not just soft drinks but also fruit juices that contain a lot of sugar now even for people that are of healthy weight and who do not have metabolic cyndrums there may be an additional reason to not want to injest very sweet foods and hitly refine sugars and this has to do with a new and emerging area of new trician neuro science and i want to point out that these are new data right it is not a loch the double blind plocibo controlled studies in large populations have not been finished i want to a i want to make sure that that is clear but i also one a m clear what some of the really exciting data coming from daina small slab at yale and from otherlaboratories are showing and this has to do with what is called condition tase preference using a kind of pavlovian paradime what they do is they have people and these studies were done in people injest maltidextran which increases blood glucos tdoes not have much flavor but even if it does have a little bit of subtle flavor the maltidextran is cloaked by some other flavor and by cloking it with that other flavor or paring it with that other flavor what they find is that over time because the maltidextran increases blood glucos and their injesting a particular flavor along with that multiedextran they can then remove the multedextran and the flavor will induce and increase in insolent the increase in insolent of course is the consequence of the fact that any time there is arise in blood glucos provided the person is 't diabetic there is a parallel increase in insolent now this is very interesting because what it says is well at a first pass it says that we are very pavhlovian in terms of our physilogical responses to foods and particular flavors come to be associated with particular patterns of blood glucos increase and hence patterns of insolent increase because of course insolent manages glucos in the blood stream as i mentioned earlier this also has implications for understanding things artificial sweeteners and here i want a high light that this is still very controversial work a needs more data but none heless i to share it with use for consideration the small laboratory is done studies inhumans both in adults and inchildren showing that if the flavor of artificial sweetners is pared with maltedextran and then the maltidextran is removed that the artificial sweetener taste itself can subsequently increase insolent in the blood stream in other words taking something that in increases blood sugar attaching a flavor experience to that having children are adults injest that thing a lows the nervous system to associate that flavor with that increase in blood glucos but then you can remove the glucos increasing substance and the flavor alone will increase insolent because insolen typically follows blood glucos this is a conditioning effect now the reason these date are controversial is severalfold first of all the landscape around the discussion around artificial sweetners is definitely what i would call a barbed wire topic and i want a preface whan i 'm about to say next by saying i actually injest artificial seetners i will have the occasional diet soda not every day maybe ounol once or twice a month i do not particularly the taste but i'll do it just cause its around and once in caphine and i i the carbonation from on a plain or something i do injest plant base non coloric sweetners to mi y knowledge there have not been high quality studies of plant bastes non coloric sweeteners in the contexts that 'm referring to here oci none the less these study showed that particular flavors can be condition to cause an insolent increase and the flavor associated with certain artificial sweetners is included in that category of flavers that can induce insolent even in the absence of something that can increase blood glucos now the simple take away from these studies would be the following and this is actuall the one interpretation that a dana small has offered to her data but she offers other interpretations as well one of interpretation is that if people are going to injest artificial sweetners and they do that along with foods that very sharply increase blood glucos then there is the potential i the potential for those same artificial sweeteners to increase insolen even in the absence of food in other words less to straw the sanariout in the real world your having a dietsoda along with a cheeseburger and fries you do that every day for lunch ocas some whane extreme example but natural world example you that every day for lunch and then you just have a dietsoda alone the extreme interpretation of the data they have collected says well that diesoda alone will increase insolent even though there is no increase in blood glucos becaus you have not injested foodo that because you conditiond that taste of artificial sweetener to the experience of a risein glucos and ene insolent now the counter argument to this would be well that is a very unusual situation multidecser n causes big increases in blood glucos that is not really a a fair experiment or it is not our natural world experiment and i think that is o a decent assessment although i will point out that one of the reasons why this study is controversal or why these data are controversial is that the experiment actually had to be stopped in particulary the experiment in children had to be stopped because the changes in insolen that were observed early in the study were detrimental that the institutional reviewboard quite appropriately said we cannot do this to these kids theire experiencing these odd shifts an insolen that are not healthy for them when they are just injesting artificial sweetners in the absence of these glucos increasing foods once again i do inin jest artificial sweeteners i'm not saying that they are dangerous i'm not saying ah that they are not dangerous i'm sayigthat you have to decide for yourself in previous episodes i've high lighted that artificial sweetners have been shown in studies of animals that when given in very hih dose is sucrelos in particular there can be fairly robust disruption to the gopmicrobium which is vital for a mune health an brain health et cetera et cetera but thus far aur knowledge of how artificial sweetners negatively imp acts or posively in pacts i should say the microbiom and other dilitarious effects on the body has mainly been explored in animal studies again the work by dana small has been done in humans theire some parallel work by others in animal models i bring it up to day to illustrate the following point normally we have a pathway that we do not have to condition at all it is there from birth whereby ingestion of sweet foods causes increases in dopamine and there are parallel pathways by which nurons in our gut and elsewhere in our body trigar further increases in dopamine there is no need for a condition response or to become pavlovian about this right your hard wire to want to eat sweet things by at least two an probably three parallel pathways now the work from dana small slap and others that have illustrate this condition flavor preference i think beautifully show that any flavor that is associate with a gluco spite or a long sustained increas in glucos can also be condition in other words the circuits for dopamine that reenforce the desire to eat particular things is not unique to the sugar pathway and this is one of the reasons i believe why ingestion of sweet foods does not just lead us to want to eat more sweet foods i think that is absolutely clear based on animal data and on human data i think thats robost his actually the stuff of text books now but in addition ingesting sweet foods end our foods that raise blood glucos but that we do not perceive as sweet for instance foods with hidden sugars sugars that ben massed by salty or spicy tastes increases our desire for glucos elevating foods and food generally i think that is the only logical interpretation of the data that i can arrive at for people that struggle with regulating their appetite or with regulating their sugar appetite i think the understanding of condition flavor preference while a lubit complicated ought to be useful in trying to navigate reducing sugar cravings and sugar in take as a segway into tools to control sugar ind take as a means to both regulate sugar an take itself as well as food an take over all and steer us towards healthier choices and to talk about some of the special populations out there that might want to be espetially wary of having a disregulated sugar appetite system and the group i'm referring to specifically are those whith attention defisite hiperactivity disorder or whyr should they and or people who have istues with focus and attention generally and i think more and mornoutdays i'm hearing that people are having a hard time focusing this probably has something to do with our interactions with electronic devices is always say if a picture is worth a thousand words an movy is worth a million pictures and the fact that we can access many m vies in just by scrolling with our thumb is something that the nervous system has just never contended with before in human history and confident of that and it is not that it cannot deal with it the question is what is the trade off and what are the consequences of that attension an ability to focus is obviously key to success in school success in relationships success in the work place and success in life we coul provbleving go far as to say one's ability to succeed in anything is proportional to one's ability to focus and then deliberately defocus when the time comes to defocus trit as we all need rest in we need a disengage in then re engage if you look at the sum total of the medanalysies and the clinical data on eighty eight st and nutricion you arrive at a pretty clear answer which is that sugar consumption in particular highly refine sugars is just not good for people with eighty eight year the tentional issues now as i say that i also want you to recall the earlier study that ie referred to whereby the tuning of nerons in the brain is highly dependent on glucos this does not mean consuming no glucos is going to be a good idea it does not mean that a the quitogenic diet is necessarily the best diet for eighty eigh st although there are some people pursuing that an exploring that and it will do yet another episode on eighty eight she at some point that goes aloit deeper into that because there re some new data i did do a very long and a fairly extensive a episode on eighty eight ste you will come to look that up if you in our arca excuse me in our archive at huber manlabdat come a it isall time stamped a you non't because the number o people said oh it' said an episode on eighty eight seeny mate two and half hours long yes we did because we wanted to be as comprehensive as we could at the time but it is time stamps you can just jump to the particular topics of interest in their short little a cassets there now if you would to know upon what i'm basing the statement that sugar consumption and highly refine sugar consumption i is potentially bad for eighty eigh st a basing this mainly on the conclusions of a of a realy nice paper that the title of the paper is sugar consumption sugar sweet en beverages and attention defisit hiper activity disorder a systematic review in medanalysis and this is a paper a well put a link to this in in the caption this was a publishing complementary therapies in medicine which is a bit of an atypical journal in some sense but i really this medanalysis a the the sum total of of this medanalsis is really that when especially kids get beyond four sugary drinks pur week for sodas of yon typical twelve ounc soda a when they get past four twelve ounce sugary sodas they did not a as far as i know look at artificial sweeten sodas that is when you start to see a shift towards a more negative outcomes more symptoms of existing eighty eigh st now where the controversy comes in is weather not sugar consumption can actually trigar or caus eighty eight sh and i do not think we can conclude that at all at this time and this review if you decide to check it out review slashmenanalsis i should say if you decide to check it out goes into some of the new aunts around that what is also interesting in terms of eighty eigh st and sugar an take and probably as relevants to all of us is that they also cover some of the interesting data showing that supplementation with omega three fatiacids can actually be beneficial for people in pretular kids with eighty eght i've talk before about the utility of omega threes that is been shown in various studies that have compared omega three fatiacid an take to say prescription and to depressens acessorizes prosic loft and similar fluoxity and there is als of those studies are pretty clear at least to me that provided that one gets at least one gram of e p a essential fatiacid it is not just getting one gram per da but one or more grams per da of the e p e form of sential fadiacid can rival some prescription and a depressns and or decrease the amount of and to deprecens thats required to take which for a lot of people can be a very useful thing because of the sidifect profile of many of those antetoprecents of course talk your sychatres talkd your doctor but the omegathrees are no doubt powerful and then of course is all story about o megathrees in heart health and of course anything else there some controversy around a megathrees but i think the date are clear enough to me around moodin party of asco health that certainly i personally in jasthemb as always i always say any time you are going to add or remove anything from your nutrician supplementation exercise or other whise your life style defly consult with a board certified physicion i do not to say that to protect me i say that to protect you you are responsible for your health ultimately omega three supplementation has been shown to be beneficial for eighty eiht st why my talking about this in the contect of an episode on sugar and the nervous system well if you remember those nuropod ells those cells in your gut that respond to sugar and send signals up to the brain to cause the release of dopemin well turns out that neropod cells also respond to a mino acids and to fatiacids in particular essential fatiacids these cells that we call nerropod cells have three jobs one is to detect levels of sugar in the got the other is to detect levels of a mino acids and to detect levels of particular essential fatiacids and communicate that information to the brain and i should point out whethen i said communicate that information the're not actually sanc he there is a mino acid r oh there' sugar here ohe there is essential fadiaids because the language of these cells is somewhat generic it is just the firing of electrical potentials but that is the key point it is ceneric and all three or any of those three sugar essential fatiacids or aminoacids will trigar these nurants to signal to the brain to increased opeming and it is not coincidental that omegathree fadiacid supplementation can help ameliorate some of the symptoms of eightiht by way of presumably increasing dopomine in this neuropod to dopomine pathway that we talked about earlier the whole thing has a very nice logical structure to it and points to yet again the immense value of bringing the proper amounts may be even supplementing the proper amounts of omegathre fatiacids and the proper amounts of a minoacids into the gut as a way to supplant some of the stimulation of these pathways that would otherwise be caused by sugar there is actually aversion of this where one could say if you want to reduce sugar cravings you might consider increasing certain forms of a minoacid in take or certain forms of fatiacid in take what are some ways that we can reduce our sugar cravings and ideally wags that we can do that that also benefit us in other ways both netricially and from the nauro scient standpoint well these neuropod sells that respond to and signal the brain when we injest sugar as i mention also respond to a minoacis and ssential fatiacids we already talked about the essential fadiacids i make it a particular point to ingest anywhere from one to three grahms that is grahams of epi essential fatiacid per day i make it appoint to do that with the ingestive high quality a omegathrees for me the simplest way to do that and i think for most people the lowest costway to do that is to use some liquid form of fissioil or some capsil form of fisiaoil you really do have to see how much a essential fadiac in the form of epie is in those if you trying do that only through capsils thit can get kind of expensive depending on a which particular a bran to use somehow more pe some less you can of course also do this through foods you can do this with non fish sources through things algy in their sim other forms you can look it up on line now uno plant base sources of a eps you do the with with high quality fisciaoil in any case that does seem at least based on a modest amount but none the less solid literature to reduce sugar craving somewhat but that could easily be by mere replacement of calories right we do not know yet based on human studies whether not the ingestion of those epes is specifically activating the neuropod sells which specifically activ its dopin release and by pasces the need for out where the craving for sugar we do not know that yet but but logically holds up a to assume that the fact that these neuropod sells end i should say other nurands within the gut respond very robusly to the presence of particular aminoacids is also a petential lever by which one could reduce sugar cravings and there is an interesting literature around the eminoacid gludomine in particular supplementing with the eminoacid gludomine as it relates to sugar cravings and certainly y as it relates to other aspects of the got in particular leeky gut the use of supplemental gludomine to try ind treat leiki got is not a new phenomenon there are other approaches to of course but there are many people who are experimenting with supplementing with gludomine several grahams per day often even five grahams distributed through three or four different servings throughout the day in as ae way to blunt their sugar cravings now there has not yet been a large scale clinical trial using gludomine to reduc sugar cravings but the results of the few studies that i looked at as well as my understanding of the logic of these neral circuits in gluding the neuropotcells brings us to a conclusion that it makes sense why if there is a population of nurans within our gut that responds very robustly to the presence of sugar fadiacids oromino acids that the intake of particular eminoacids would allow the dopomine pathways that might otherwise be trigared by sugar to be triggared by something gludomine which has very few or no caleries and in fact having talked about this previously aa number people that i know went out and tried this now this is of course is what i call anic data right this is not a does not a a quality per reviewed study this is anicdata a many of them have reported back that they actually feel as if their sugar cravings are reduced i know some people who actually take gludomine and mix it with full fat cream and take a countly shot o full fat cream which sounds absoly delicious by the way glumies ill but chocky it is not that great tasting to injest with sugar i should mention if you do try and take this approach of en jesting gludomine to reduce sugar cravings you want to increase the amount of gludomine that you take somewhat gradually it can create some gastric distress if you just ou ni certainly when take a big tablespoon of it thrown and water and shuget down three times a day some of you with very hearty stomachs can provatly tolerate that n i year my a my bulldog which unfortu in passaway but costello i always imagine that if ever we did otopsyon im he have a license platin a a human being in is gut cosim you could injest anything with no issues but of course many people have can a sensitive guts if you are going to try taking gludomine as it means to reduce sugar cravings just now that the studies are still on going some people have achieved benefit please also realize that thereis an entire literature devoted to the potential hazards of increasing gludomie if you have a pre existing cancer if you have cancer your canceor prone i i would really discourage you from this approaching in any case has always talk to your doctor the logic none the less is there why increasing aminoacid and take wer fadiacid and take might decrease sugar craving now there are other ways to reduce sugar craving and there are certainly ways to reduce the sharp rise in blood glucose that can occur when we injest sugary sweet foods or even just an abundance of carbohydrate foods and there are huge number of these things iam gon i sort of layer up through the the ones that you might finding your covered at the grocery store and then get into some of the more a extravagant er i should say a esoteric ones many of which however a can be quite potent the first of which a is simple lemon juice right or lime juice there was an old lore and actually some papers pointing to the idea that the ingestion of vinegar a either white vinegar what or wine vinegar could somehow blunt blood glucos after the ingestion of sugary foods or theingestion of a lot of carbahydrate foods are evenjest a big meal i she tim ferris i should say the great tinperris cause i do have great respect for the fact that he seems to be about ten years ahead of everything a both an terms of nutrition and skill learning in things that sort many f the things that he predicted in his books a the for our body and the for our sheff actually a turned out to be true based on scientific data some of which only exists in the animal models but now a also some predictions that a that blayed out to be true in both the animal motls and and the human model i think that tim certainly deserves a i a hat tip a for the fact that he a experimented with these methods and a and reported his experiences with those methods and that now a some of them many of them have been validated by what i perceived to be quality science he talked about the fact that t least in his experiments on himself a the ingestion of vinegar did not seem to blunt blood glucos and he was using continuous glucosponders these incidentally and other example of ware of farris was early to the a to the game and the rest of u are kind of just in his wake he talked about the use of of blood glucos monters those i think at the time were inplanted below the skin nowadays their lessin vase of blood lucos monitors s levels and forth in thse are ashly becoming pretty popular i've warn one of these before the actually pretty informative a i learned forences that when i goin the sana that i experiences sharp rise in a blood glucos and that make sense because of a the dehydration associated with being in the sona lot of sweating ye concentration of sugar in the blood stream goes up a there is some other things at certain foods affect my bood glucos one way or anothers kin of interesting in fon experiment that some of you might be interested in doing his swell regardless there are now data pointing to the fact that lemon juice and lime juice couple tablespoons are if injested before or even during or even after consumption of sugary foods or i should say foods that sharply increase blood glucos or large copahydrate meals can actually blunt the blood glucos response and i did see that when iht did my own experiments on myself with continuous glucosponder whis kind of funded you those experient experiments a i preferred to do those experiments by eating somewhat larger meals of things that did not contain a lot of sugar saw some big increases in blood glucos and certain inctancs and then i would in jestsome some lemon juice or lime juice tipically mixed in with water and sure enough you could see a blunting of the blood glucos response and of ourses was real time a blood continuous hance continuous blood glucos mondering for those of you that are interested in blunting your blood sugar response certain foods that is a simple low cost way to do that if you will not explor it i will say if your are fasting an you already have low blood glucos and you injest lemon juice or i should say some lemon juice and water lime juice and water be careful because you can actually become hypogli seemic right for the very same reasons that these a that lemon juice and lime juice can blount blood glucos when your blood glucos levels are moderate to hi you can also reduce blood glucos levels even further when blood glucos levels are low now that is lemon juice and lime juice there a but we cannot say that as to dou with acidic things generally and just as a side pointment of view of problishing the store called adjusted p h waters or foods and drinks thersplus to adjust your p h hate to break it to you but your p h is very tightly regulated throughout your brain and body you do not want this to change it is intirely impossible at least in any safe way that you would become quotiquo more alkaline by injusting and alkaline water something that it is true that your that p h your alcalinity an acidity varies in different compartments in your body that is important unless you are a hemerging or vomiting or the something badly wrong with you healthwise in your n really dire circumstance you do not want big shifts in your body p h in your body has all sorts of ways of buffering against changes in p h a anchourage you not to fall on the or yo hop on the ban wagon of adjusting p h in becoming lass acitic in that kind of thing when you injust lemon juice or lime juice the mechanism by which it blunts blood glucos is probably toofuld one is probably through the post in jest of effects of glucos in the gut meaning the way in which sugars are interacting with nurons and other components of your got circuitry to impact things gastric emptying time to impact things the firing of those nauropod sells an their signaling to the brain but almost certainly it has something to dou also with the perception of sour taste on the tongue we did not go into this too much to day but you of course do not just have sweet tastes receptors in your mouth youlls have bitter taste receptors you have salty taste receptors you have sour taste receptors in your mouth and on you and of course that means your tongue and palate and those are interacting if you injust a substance that is just sweet or mostly sweet that causes a certain set of effects on your blood glucos but all your brain dopamine and the other narl circuits of your brain if you also in jest something that sour lemon juice or lime juice it adjust the output of those naurl circuits in your brain again we have a situation we have too parallel path ays one that is post injestives coming from phenomenon within our gut nurons but also thinks gastric empting time that clearance and the transfer of food and the conversion of food into particular new trancend the circulation of glucos in your blood stream and how it gets into the brain but also simply by injesting something sour you are changing the way that sweet things impact your brain and i think it stands to reason that the lemon juce lime juce effact is not going to be magic it is going to have everything to do with the way that injesting sour foods can adjust the taste scuse me can adjust the nural response to taste of sweet foods and in fact we know based on the beautiful work of charles zooker at columbia medical school that that is exactly what happens they have measure the the activity of nurons at various locations in the call taste pathways of the brain and they found that when particular tastes just sweet or just bitter or just sour evoke certain on sombles of nurons to fire in particular sequences when sweet en sour coinjested when bitter and sourar coinjested you get distinct on sombles meaning distinct patterns of activity of those nurons and of course distinct patterns of downstream activity within the brain and body while it is still somewhat mysterious as to how exactly things lemon juice and lime juice can reduce our blood glucos spikes when we injest thos with sweet foods or carbohidrate laden foods are with big meals you can use us as a tool with the understanding that there is a grounding in the biology of the way these circuits work now some of you have probably heard that cinnamon can be a useful tool for controlling blood sugar and indeed that is the case it is very clear that cinnamon can a just the rate of gluco sentry into the blood stream possibly by changing o the rate of gastric emptying it might slow the rate of gastric emptying and thereby also reduce the glycemic index of particular foods i suppose if i rgan eat a mango and i had not just done a bunch of hard training a might sprinklesome cinamen on it here i ways enjoy con to coming up with new ideas of ways that i can eat foods during these podcests in any event there is some debate out there if you look on line as to whether not sygon cinnamen casio sinmon cinnamon scuse me or salon cinnamon is best for purposes of at of blunting blood gluco spikes but i think the at least by my reed of of the data and from what i found it does not really matter provided it is real cinnamon and you have to actually look and and make sure that it is real cinnamon because a lot of cinnamen tha you buy is not real i do want to provide a cautionary note about cinnamon however cinnamon contain something called cumedon which can be toxic at high levels you do not want to injest more than about a teaspoon may be a teaspoon and half of cinnamon per day o because you will start to exceed the threshold at which cinnamon could on start to be problematic but certainly if you our going to have a big meal or a meal that has a a lot of sugar in it or a lot of carbohydrate am laden food and you do not want an increase in blood glucos you could a put cintamen in a beverage you cold put sentiment on food in order to blunt that a blood glucos increase reduce the glycemac index by way of reducing gastric empting time again just making sure that you do not get out pasted that one and half teaspoons per day cause you really do not want to a start dealing with any of the toxicity relate to commiden we have talked about lemon juice and lime juice and cintimen these are kind of commonplace in many kitchens then of course we can venture into the moore eso teric or i would say the more advance tools for adjusting sugar in take and the one that comes to mine is of course berberine berberine is a derivitive of tree bark and is a very very potent substance for reducing blood gluco much that is on par with met forman or glebencleminde which ar prescription drugs specifically used to reduce blood glucos using berberine is a serious step you should absoluluy talked your doctor about it i know of a number of people that use it to lower blood glucos when they eat really large meals i know a number of people that are using it to get to some of the other effects ofe met forman that people have discussed things a activading or tapping into the called a mpiq pathway of reducing emtore these are people that are a aiming their activities tat a increasing longevity a somewhat controversial approach still but i know many of people are doing it it is true that if you in jest berberine your blood lucos will plumat and i point that out because i've actully tried it before it gave me brutal headaches and i felt really dizzy and i felt i could not see straight and actually i could not see straight why do do that well it made me hypo glyceemac citd actually drove my blood glucos down too far and the reason ot did that is that i took berberine on an empty stomach i know some people can tolerate it i would say be very cautious about in jesting berberine on an empty stomach or if you are in a low carbohydrate diet unless you really know what your doing and you have a medical professional the kind of guide you through that if i took berberine along with a very large meal that include a lot of carbohydrates n i can recall the days in which costello and i would yeat a couple of peatz as and then we might get ice cream that kind of thing then i felt perfectly fine on even up to seven hundrod fifty meligrams are a gram of berberine it has the kind of unique property of making you feel not overwhelmed by the amount of blood glucos increase that your experiencing frorm eating a big meal ido not quite know how else to describe it it is almost as if you can keep eating and eating and eating and of corse you have to am protect your a gastric volume right in mean ou only have much space in your stomach in just food a i was not using it to gorge on food i just hurd about it i was interestin experimenting with it i do not have any am chronic blood sugar issues but again when i took it on empty stomach it may be hypoglycemi with on a low carbohydrating take hypoglycemic not a good experience o and again an experience i think to avoid but provided there is a lot of glucos in your blood stream and certainly if you are of the experimental type or you trin to regulate blood glucos burberine might be a good option but again talk to your doctor it does have some other interesting effects terms of lowing total colesteral that a research supported of om reducing insolen a little bit when that is not surprising if you reduce blood glucos are going to reduce insolen because of course insolen manages blood glucos in the blood stream i would place burberine and of course met forman and globanclomide in the kond of the heavy hitting potent tools for regulate regulating blood glucos now this is an episode not about sugar per say but sugar viewed through the lends of the nervous system and what is interesting about burberine met forming globanclamade and related substances is that some of the effects are of course on gastrictemptying or buffering bood glucos within the blood stream et cetera but there appear to also be some nural effects of having chronically low glucos or blunting blood glucos through things berberine and some of those nural effects include long standing changes in the hormonal cascades that are the consequence of having low blood sugar and thereby changes in the nural circuits that manage blood glucos over all the simple way of saying this is that by maintaining low to moderate blood glucos either by not in justing heavilu carbohydrate latin foods here i'm speaking to the low carbon of the keetorgenic types or by blunting blood glucos through things met forman or berberine even if injsting carbohydrates may beven some sugars over time it seems that there is a adjustment whill we call a homeostatic regulation of the nerl circuits that control things sugar craving and indeed some people report feeling fewer sugar cravings over time now i did not use burberine for a very long period of time i've never used met forman i have experience the somewhat odd but welcome phenomenon of with each progressive year of my life i have fewer in fewer sugar cravings why that is i do not know i suspect it might have something o do with my sleep and i'll talk about that in a few minute but if you are going to explore burberine or met formen or otherwise in addition to working with a doctor i thing you should understand why youre doing it right i think that many of the effects can be quite potent they can happen in both the immediate termin terms of regulating blood glucos they can send you hypoglycemic if you are are not careful they can also cause long standing changes to the norl circuitry that regulates blood sugar over time some of which might be welcome changes riht reduce sugar cravings for instance and if you are really really serious about modulating blood glucos through things burberine the typical dose range again as anywhere from half a gram to one point five grams daily that is the typical dosages that have been explored and there are some other substances am sodium caprate am which are known to augment the effects of burberine via the a mpq pathways they basidly can increase the ability for burberine to have its gluco slowering actions but that of course is getting into the really potent what i would call sharp blade tools for controlling blood lucos and thisten any time you are dealig with lucos you are dealing with the brains preferred source of fuel and any time youre daling with the brains preferred source of fuel you have to be especially cautious about depriving the brain of what it needs whether not your low carb high carb am qidovig and carnivor these substances burberine are very very potent and you need to take them seriously there is yet another tool for controlling sugar cravings and the nural circuits that regulate sugar craving and its downstream consequences and this tool is what i would call a high performance tool but it is one that you probably did not suspect and that is sleep done extensive episodes about sleep and we actually have an episode cal master your sleep o yu can find that episode easily at huberman labda cam ints vailable i all the verios formats you to baplesbodify et cetera and provides a lot of tools and on social medioprovi a lot of tools often we have a news letter the provides tools a hat of maximi sleep what is the roll of sleep in sugar metabolism sugar hunger and the way that the brain regulates those things well there is a really exciding study that came out just last year the study was publish in the journal sell report sellpress jurnal excillent journal and the reason i love the study much is it involved having people yes this was done in humans sleep in the laboratory that is not unusual there is a sleep rabit stamford their sleep lavs elsewhere but what they did was they actually measured from the breath of these people and they extracted from their breath the metabolites that would allow them to understand what sorts ive metabolism was accurring in these people's bodies at different phases of sleep and this is really remarkable study they actually did this every ten seconds throughout the entire night in little tiny tensecret beens meaning it very high resolution they could evaluate was the metabolism in the brain and body that people experiences they go from remislyp rapid eye movement sleep to slowwave sleep and on and i'll go deeper into the study again in the future because it interesting and i think important but what they discovered was that each stage of sleep was a sociate with a very particular signature pattern of metabolism and particular phases of sleep are associated with sugar metablism or more with fatmetabolism or more with other aspects of metablism and the reason wh i think thi study is important to discuss in thecontexts of to day's discussion about sugar in the brain is that many people have experienced the effects of disrrupted sleep on their appetite and in particular its been reported that when people are sleep deprived or the quality of their sleep is disrupted that their appetite for sugary foods increases now that was always assume to be due to some metabolic need that was triggered by the sleep deprivation or by the poor sleep but in reading over thes study some of the more importantmpoints made by the authors relate to the fact that well sleep is known to have incredibly important effects on brain an body a variety of systems imune system norl functioning et cetera this very organized sequence of particular forms of metabolism being active during particular phases of sleep which are very very well orchestratas we know slowwave sleep and remsleepeing orchestrate in ninety minute called ol trati an sycles and on and forth is thought to perhaps set up the brain and body to be able to regulate itself in the waking hours and therefore when people are sleep deprived or deprived of certain forms or states within sleep such as rapidie movement sleep that it creates a disruption in a particular set of metabolic pathways now we do not want to leap too far from this study to sugar metabolism in the norl circuits controlling sugar metabolism but i will say this if you look at the sum total of the data on obisity or on typtudiabetes or on metabolic syndrums of any kind you almost always see disruptions in sleep now some of those could be due to sleep apnia caused by even just the size of somebody is neck or the weight of their body inother warcs we do not know the direction of the effact right metabolic cyndrums could disrupt sleep which disrpmet metabolic cyntrums and indeed the authors point out quite appropriately that they do not understand the direction that of the effects that they observe either but there is now a plether of datea pointing to the fact that getting qualityes sleep each night helps regulate not only appetite but also the specific forms of metabolism that drive specific appetites the take away is while there are extravagant and potent in a interesting ways to regulate blood gluccos everything from cinnamon to lemon duce to burborine to sodium caporate to a behavial tools to the mure understanding of haw the direct and indirect pathways go from the got to dopamine et cetera if you are not establishing the firm foundation of proper metabolism all of those things are going to be sort of rearranging deckchairs on the titanic as as sometimes described we cannot overstate the importance of getting regular sufficient amount of high quality sleep at least eighty per cent f the time not just for sake of immune system function for clear thinking et cetera but also for properly regulating are metabolism including our sugar metabolism thank you for joining me for this discussion about sugar and the nervous system and how they are

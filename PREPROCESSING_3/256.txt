a quick warning there are curst words that are unbeeped in today's episode of the show if you prefer a beepd version you can find that at our websight this american life dout awork garry did not want to become a footbubwayer no interest in the game at all he was a timid kid kind of kid who in baseball would close his eyes when he was up at bat he was scared o getting hip by the ball whuwhen your high school theu personal hes stood up for grabs and gary's high school therewas not one person but two people with a very different vision of who he was they were assistant highschoolfootball coaches and very noticeable big personalities and they were twins and i dodn't really know their name i'd seen them round they were superhandsome and in great shafe him en they were rit and they would wear gold scim tank tops and jams these shorts these wine shorts they on thooses and they had really long hair and they weethey were very charming carris manic funny and they were known as the jetsons which was the the self proclim an nickname i think mad they called themselves the jetson gehave heard to themselves yat because the the jetsons was people from the future and they felt that they were that they they were defiling the first people i ever notices who referred to themselves and is tat the third person man nd the jetsons are coming to get you the jetsons will see you the jetson jetswat they were o tams they would they would say johnny jetson will be with you to day jo jetson po with you tomorrow they are magical figure ye and these magical figures these assistant for butgoaces they gave gary his own nickname involved junior year het was not a glittery name the jetsons gon the opposite actially waste they called him as in waste of talent to gold man to playin football they told him the football would get him a college scholarship uld get him girls this said the newspaper would write about him they wont on amon the team sad bebly because garry was a jgiant hebring to mostert kids playing football back ther this is imputity massachusetts buston suburb near salom in the lad aities mest highschool players back then with five nine bi've ten garry was six six two hundred pounds nd he was athletic but baskaball on his high school team this gudges scolded him for his complete lack of aggression and for crying what he really loved doing was art projects going to the arton crafts store reading he kept an enormous stuffed animal collection in his room even in high school he is ost pretty depressed at the time garry's a commedian to day garry gullmen non stage when he tries to describe what he was as a kid i talk about being charley brown i say picture on my childhood charley brown if snupy had died that that was mhy that was mhy childhood i felt sorry for him hi as at a bron the whole point of his character is that he' sat in long way yet even that was not lonely enough you have to kill off his gals yes in the jetsinstead of tellng him that they were gong to make him into a star he laughed at all he the attention from the jetson shore but he did not consider this seriously at all football seemed brutal just non stop violent physical contact he did not think he could cut it guis he knew who played football they were tof garry on the other hand he got picked on he got bullied he was bullied out of little league football no way and nan his junier ended and just a couple days in to summerbray it was june six thirty in the morning getphone call bool come ofp is the twins they said gullman this is the jetsors met us at the universe jim at seven thirty we are going to train the gulman the summer and get the gullman a scholarship and make the goll man and to a star by the end of the summer you will be two hundred forty five pounds and ripped arnold i was wear and bold and on the spur of the moment he figures what they helt and he has thits thought that you have sometimes said kidy things thes a dot say i can do this maybe they right they were convince him they were convinced h and then there was a part of you thay thought li heyes magical man it was it was intoxicating it was becaus they were pool and my entire life my my family was more of a a do not get your hopes up type of attitude of philosophy of thingstone do not always work out the way you want them to and and as a very negative house and i remember asking them for such s really thankum n play on the sig school for paltima i i do not have that much experience and the ther answernshould i swearor just they wer reay havn every single time i would ask him any kind of quessonis a fakye and not everybody was using that expression back then that was the first insense of somebody saying that to me instead of do not get your hopes up and we will see it was fakye man i just i was all my tash these gis are are are exciting and they believe in me lat summer every morning he works out with jetsons from seven thirty and nine thirty then take in to a diner they bying a big breakfast with aigs andother protines at night sone thens to teach him running routs neberigarry had never played football and it was just the jets and said it was incredible it was a a rocky montach i was getting stronger and bigger and they would say things theythey have this thing the dull man is getin yoge the gull man is get ting youge and soby the end of the summer had you wok i look fartastic mana i i grown my har long them and cloes started to look really coo ma they were as i was filling out and they were they were right i waigh two und or forty pounds i could bent frest two und r twenty five pounds i ran a forty ight forty which was was very impressive to everybody everything about me had had changed physically i iad built this really great costume what he say costume because it it covered up w hill he was i was still the same the same garry who who cried at movis have this man costume be that you are wearing get is your new body yes i feel terrific and as it came time to start practices you would think that he would be sighe to use this new body that he created for the purpose ha a been made for o k he is kept in america its world were two bring on the notzes but in fact he was terrified of just getting hit of the physical contact that shoul built into football and a week before practice he talks to a friend and he says to the friend he does not thin can can do it he does not tincan go through with it should he call the jetson to tell him he stotted over it is not for him i nover forget what he said he said gary they will kill you they spent their entire summer training you an and feeding you you cannot you have to could prugh with this he did he went through ith it but the fobmas as john jetson put it he was a daisy in a field of weeds a lamp among conquerors you u put again to a tughgy costume but does not always make him into a topga and of course a dults are always trying to convince kids and inspire kids about who they can be that is what could parents you that could teachers do but some kid lit garry just have trouble going along with the plan they want to please the adults they want o do what theyr asked but all the while they genuinely wonder can they actually become the person the adulter talling them to become is that down is that who they should be and it is totally confusing for them the adults in their lives seems to know wat ther talking about there dults for god's sake thers supposed to know better but the kids into wondering in a really primal way who am i i from basy chicago it is this american life on or glass i showe ta day in two acts in the second act i dolt to make it to a woman cannot even decide what is true about some of the most basic facts a at her on history but i'm wa dstrubbin this story a one garry story which were call ing jersy short garry went to his first sfootby practice and it was just as bad as he ad imagine it would be guys rush at him and smash into him on every play it is totally painful he is completely miserable bruised it was in this one play this guy hit me helmet to helmet and it was loud a gun shot and and everybody noticed it and they called it a biz and the way got its name was they said that the jetson as told me this they said the biz is the sound that it makes when you get hit in the head turn a game which is buz and each week the the guy who had the best t hit on somebody else would get this tea shirt called the the biz of the week ta shirt and now we know that that these things these buziness that they were concussions but at the time in nineteen ighty eight the concussion protocol was pretty much you gould you gould and that first time that i got biz the jetsons were proud of me they they hie fives me in they patted my my head the gull man got biz is first biz i was laughing along with them but i was i i hope that never happens again s everyday garry would shop at practice and heeded it i tail finally they started to play real games n these ar just precees and scrimmages but there against other high schools is a crowd in t e stands that changed everythingfrom the very first time they put him in on our fence they set up a play for me it is the pass where they just throw it over the middle they throw it up hi nobody can rage as high as i can jump i catch it it takes a couple of guyes to to bring me down just because i'm i'm big and i want to run away from contact there were fans they were cheering i will say that was exhilarating goachestray amount wit defence he barely knows what he is doing and he sacks the other sides quarterback i had no technique tebut i was just much bigger than this kid that that he could not outoutrun me because he was not as fast as me and he was not as strong as me h i was able to restle on to the ground anyhow we go in to the to the lockrum and the coach is berading the other players on the team for for not being aggressive and he says the only person out there sticking anybody which i do not know if they still use that expression but i that express sticking anybody is garry gulman a kid who never play footbl hotill this summer and i wul i had goose pumps and it was it it was a movy it it is all happening just all hapenit just the jetsons had said it was uncanny open he gave me the real season the coaches start him this newby player he sacks the opposing quarterback right away and on all fent they threw men the ball three times i caught every single one i mean that that night i go to my first high school party i never iryo high school party and it was such a let down could you see i rey parties an movies ther exciting in their saazon and i just sat on on a couch gaz i did not drank and and it was an incredible lat down but an i was nfit a b yewa yan i was very gan yaas for it yet you were there he now iat youwere there the bad e he made it and then sunday night the night before school a local newspaper reporter called me and interviewed me about this game he said that that i was the talk of it the town and talked about e everybody knew the ball was coming to me and they could not stop me and just the jetsons thad said there cone newspaper articles there was a newspaper article on the salom eveing news the next day that called me mister raw potential bow ye and it did not last the season opener his first great game was also his last grat game i had one more decent came wher i caught a pass i made a really really good tackle but the teams started to do this thing were they would send guys to block me on my legs and they would send a couple of guys and they would just roll into my t my legs i thng it is called a a caot block if ire if remember properly but that that was how they would sort of neutralize ma and and did not the jetsons have some technique u could use till i get around that i either either they they did not suggest one or i was not able to employ it upposing quarter backs learned to stay away from the side of the line that garry was on he was not sacking any one any more and after this one time when garry fumbled the ball on a big play at the goal line suddenly he says they stopped sending him out for passes no more huroe catches he was not making big plays he was not living up to all that bright potential and some dark part of his personality kicked in i maybe he was a waste after all the man costume had foold them for a while he was still the same person ouad always been he shued to dread practices and games i would throw up before every game on the sidline i would throw up because i was overcome by nervous and anxiety i started to feel really lousy about myself and and my grad suffered and and i just knew that i was starting to to disappoint these these guys and they never said anything to their credit they never said why we weerally had high hopes for you it just i ice it sounds crazy i still have nightmares about it his planbak than was make ithrough the season one game a week never play again and in the middle of this a college football coach came in to our lockroom and and introduced himself to me at my locker and that was sort of a a what the hell as going on here introduced himself to du mie and said what he said i you had a great game which i i hadnd and i am an assiston a dartmath college and would love for you to take a visit to dartmesth oga hersed the thing the garrey did not know or understand at the time as disheartened as he was his coachis did not think he was having a bad season sure they went sending im out for passes but the main reason for that john jets and told me on the found was not the fumble thet garry had made garry obsessed over hit was that the quarter back could not throw reliable passes the team was in that good that year an sure yes garrey didt now haw to stay on his feet when players through themselves at his ankles but john jetton says he ad only been playing football a few months of course he had not mastered that ther was not time to teach him everything the jatsons still saw garry as ha diamond in the rough garrey was doing everything they asked ran his plays well was more reliable than most of the team and the coaches did what they did with any player with ton potential hey to viddiou of garry's best game that great first game made a bunch of c opies in send id around ta colleges and after seeing that vidio a parede of repruters showed up a garry school he get called out of class to meet them he was approached by harvard holy cross you mast university of new hampshire university of man andsome top division one eg schools syricuses a boston college ispape would recently won ta cotton boll and also they were players on the team who ere all americans anm an this was a big time program tho played o big time schedule against penstate and oter dam and ohio state you a see him and they were they were big time footboll and they had higesmon trophy when ar dog flute he was the hero to everybody in my neighborhood and what d you remember them recruiting you i remember this man who had seen on tf because he had recruited dog fluting he was a new englands celebrity in his name was jackpic nell i'll never forget it because he had an office at boston college and overlooked the stadium nd he had a hison trophy and he said son i ways i lways love being called son and i would just mouth to soick an arm around the shoulder i i do not know whater is about that word he said son iman to go ahead an offer you which man a scholar shehoan i'm an offer you and he said something to the effect of your seventeen years old or maybe i was eighteen he said you have an an a fell body and and i rmurmured thinking well i've really fools another one and pardon me was thing i was afraid this was on happen because i m have to take the scholarship and i know hi'm going to be an over my head and thend the other side if it was this is exciting and somebody believes in me and and did pry did you fee on my gotting to be playing for this incredible coach whatever probs i had an high school this guy is the guy he is a genius he is gon t fix would ever prod my head i'm going to be a star ye saye takes scholarship he says he has no idea how heu would ae paid for college with that footby scholarship e woks out all summer and by the time he gets a training camp he was bigger than ever two hundred sixty pounds he speed in strength one o the best on the team but it is clear right away i just felt small mean these guys really were te supermen the regressiveness their strength it was not the same sport and it was quite clear early on to the other players that i was not them i i did not tolhis lect im ye and i could be pushed around and i i could be bullied there were guys who were going to go on to the ana fell there was one player place for the vikings and i remember one time i was lolly gaging on a play and he he hit me and bused me and he said to me afterwards and and he was he was has nickto him whom the team was the mainiac which you really have to do something impressive to get a nickname that amongst these lunatics he said to me said yyou cannot just stand there that i could have killed you and in the nicest way possible he said that he had let up even though he would hit me harder than i had ever been hit in my in my life garry went into a full blown depressive chrisis not eating when he shoudhad beneating a horse sleeping all the time crying the prevailing thing going on in my head is i wanted kill myself i'm worthless i'm useless everybody hates me and did you het this thing get this feeling if whati'm actually as strong as any of these guyes your stronger than most of them your faster than most of them i lik i i should be as good did you have a thing lik gl if i just sike myself up in the right way i'm ning to be able to do this well i just knew i knew who i was and the problem is i know who i am and i hate him i hate i me we can e disappoints and he lets

old tries to understand a moment that shaped her whole life fortunately for her thers vidio unfortunately for her it is more complicated than that that is in a minute hich cogabobe a great dea wen our programme continues to smaric an life fr my rec lass to day's programme here is looking at you kid stories of adults telling kids what they should think of themselves and kids trying to make sense of what they are told we have rrived at at two of our programm act too grown up know things that o actad was actually line from word of the flies piggy says it that grown ups have a cup of tea and talk things through and then everything is all right that is how grown ups do it it is hopeful and of course wrong headed often things do not work out that well here in the adolt world madam in the story it is this moment where a bunch of the boys chiming with their desire that they could turn to adults and in this next act a girl turns to un adlt with that same kind of hope that the adult will set things right but evor time the adults that she turns cho simp we do not agree about some very fundamental things about her elenor gordon smith reported the story for a book she wrote i got interested in uncertainty years ago there is a kind of uncertainty that we all live with whet you do not on the answer it is not a big deal ike what time that bless is coming who left the front door o than wite that pen went but i wanted to know abou the opposite high stake some certainty where the facts aunt decisive and it hurts to not know what to think whut there are big consequences it affects your whole life i wanted to know is it possible to just sit in that kind of foundational doubt oh d you just how to flip a coin and pick something anything to believe woulh is how i got interested in ecoll lumpla she is forty now but this stouts when she was sixteen and she just could not catch a brik she was in false to car ought to ha dad who had sole costidy of her for much of her life had a stroke and died she bounced around between friend's houses but wound up in a group om i just felt very at drift in the world and an anchored having last my father my best friend i was alone and i i just i was reaching out for something to feel connected to she started really wanting to know about her mum she lived near by just a couple hours drive but they had not seen each other in more than ten years the costty court had not even aloud visits and nicholl did not know why a quick worning what i am about to go into mentions different kinds of abuse nicholl had a foggy thought that her ma might have done something bad to her as a kid she remembered saying something to some one when she was young about her mm burning her feet on a stove and remembered something about a sexual abuse aligation but could that be right surely she would remember those things actually happening but she did not what if i dad had just made her say those things about her mum it had been a really ugly costody battle each parents said all kinds of things about the other what if i dad onted costody bad he invented all these oleful stories they was much about her mam that nicholl did not know she arranged to meet hr mumming person they did the sout at seeing each other more regularly but it always felt off once she remember sitting next to her mumm at dinner and putting her head down on the table in front of her she rubbed my back and it was very very uncomfortable aa i had a pretty strong reaction to it nicholl says they did not talk about any a yus rand then in the middle of that dowt a piece of evidence seemed to fall from the sky and with it the promise of knowing what had happened in the costody dispute doctor dave colwin fund na call he was the child's ia just in the costody battle that id split nicholl off from her mum and he had biddio tapes of interviews he done with her when she was a very young girl it had been his job to investigate the abuse aligations he had hot a question he was speaking at e conference would it be oca if he showed those people ta tapes nicholl remembered colwin she remembered that he would been nice to her as a kid she said ya he could use them but could she see those tapes too he agreed and recorded their meeting am do not know the effact i a ta i o mi a ti f haw o i iam sitting across from doctor corlan and there is a vidio camere i'm getting ready to watch the tapes of myself at five years old and he went through a very lengthy informed consent at the state your seventeen years old what i dois a doin jes't for an set reciis the disu si stat ta uc finally we gat the point were he was going to shut off the vidio camere that i could watch i five year old self and he asked me on what do you recall why dont we start with if you could just tell me what you cano but think i described one of the offices that he did one of the interviews in and a striped scretcher that i was wearing at the time si at t wa stat thas i at thts an no i i i ci ery s a i seventeen year old nicholl sas she cannot remember whether her mam really did hurt her i told you yes i tol the corte hat i a i my feet stol a ani sto o mever yes hat's fa how a fer o ty ow that is

fusedly to tat a her i really wanted know and then colwin brings up the alligation of sex abuse david corwene literally asks me do you remember any alligations of sexua you see ah a shers bout possibl su and my initial reaction as actually no in i remember thos fer os fote and then he startsd to speak and i say wait hold on a second never any idea seventeen year old nicholl's holl demina changes at this moment it is instant an kind of strange to watch she becomes completely still and she staring into middle distance what ou r a terer r a she is hea she was bati me her what ever reer herty me and that is when i started to recount some details a a memory that came back to me a your saying that to me that youremember having said those things you remember having experience i remever it happeni

down into a bath room and d my biological mother bathing y younger me and she touches me in appropriateln that is where the memoryston it is your watching a from outside of yourself from above youyes but i could feel the pain touand i remember saying thati i seco took a snapshon in the paintinis lon a picture o the pain an wit was in liking the pains it was my mbilogical mother even before she sold the tapes nichol at seventeen felt she would golt the certainty she wanted she remembered her ma that acchaly hiding he she watched the vios of herself as a small girl anyway co and shut off the recordo while she did and this remarkable thing happened nichols sol herself as he young girl describing the very same abuse almost wibitam i've seen the viias it is the aties that very small micolas and pig tails and white stockings co ins in a big pladshut and shaggy hair and he asks right away about nicholl's mom what she me why wys she mean her me how does she herd you i fick her finger at mi

to figure out if nichol knows the difference between what is real and what is make believe he asks her a separate things present ragan real wor she knows from things superman make believe which she also knows he gets that a swear on her oath as a browni that what she said about her mother is real she does she helds three little fingers up in the brownie salute i my ole i loo i o iin i a e there are other concerning details about nicholl's mum once she had dropped nic col off to see doctorchollwyn for one of their recorded sessions and nac col who seemed happy to be recorded and speak clearly into the microphone when a dad jo der off it suddenly concern that the microphone would broadcoss what she is saying into the waiting room where her mam says corwin asks her about the abuse she described the week before did she remember talking about that a little bit nicholl says quietly o ioii o aa e e oe iyer a yor e s i iaaeee o o i s oq she whispers before going on to talk about being burned and touched in the bath in another interview nic holl says her mothers told her to lie i i aa onel ee or yes wit e cortiber i moter r bower o a i atme it you wor atnme will not you o e atmey a gi li i he pier gi she w i sa in ba me she took him out see ps child protective services you did not yo wor li i he piee bit she would dou somethinger tell me wwit wul yho that is the vidio of six year old nicholl corwin then asks seventeen year old nicholl how she is feeling about what she just saw she says there are some questions that might never be answered but her biggest question about why she did not grow up with her mum that had an answer she was sure her mamma had a caster a ri you o expledition i mi a c no oas it is y fa at i i tet a i ii goo yo thing in as mary oitin n for nic col the tapes and her memory proved what had happened to her as a kid it was ar relief she would been worried that she was going to learn that her dad really did coach her to lie about her mum now she could put that aside she could remember him the way she always had as her best friend and a good dad but then corwin published a case study about nicholl he did not us her name he called her janedoll but corwin's case study became part of a huge dispute that was fracturing psychology in the nineties it was called the memory was and the argument was about where the repressed memories at olt suddenly remembering tro ma were real some scientist believe repressd memories were possible other said no way n colsvidio tapes and cowyn's article wet coupted by the side that thought repressed memories were real they thought nacolds case proved it cowyn had not seen his coming i'e spoken to him he says he was not on either side doctor elizabeth loftis red cowyn's odical with one eyebrowt family rase she was a psychology professor at the university of washington and a big deal it was her experiments that proved memories invaliable and she was a sta witness in hyprophol cour cases whec she ogued that iye witness recollections on reliable when the memory was began she knew which side she was on she thought repressed memories what almost never real she wrote a doorstop of a book called the mith of repressed memory when she wread the janedo case she was alarmed i knew that people were using this case is the new proof of repressed memory it was being discussed academically it was being introduced into court cases to prove that repressed memory is real and has been proven it beit was being used against heople whom i thought were innocent ah because they were on trial in their cases and we had to get to the bottom of it pot of has suspicion was the message and pot was the messenger she seen colwin testify in court on another case a patient accused that therapist of abuse and she did not find him persuasive there either im already had a suspicion about coorin and his judgment hi think going into this situation because of the work i had seen him do on this other case and how he had pretty much help to ruin the life of this poor female psychiatrice who was the accused person in this other case you ar saying that the female psychiatrist was accused of a bou yes by by i think of former patient and cowyn was saying that that had happened in many words yes he was he was an expert for the accuser lofta's decided to investigate the jane do case she wanted to know whether the abuse had really happened but to do that she needed to know the real name of that little gorl rather than ascowyn which would be nomal for e resuch a looking into some one else's study she decided to deground on her own lofta's knew whet to stot cluse in the capes at some point in the tape he called her na col andi just made a little nentl no her name is ne col he said something and when you were living in resn i thoutmn it has something to do with fresna that kind of thing she contited of private investigated to run down some tipes she such death records for ne colds father she found dozens of matches and she souted narrowing them down closing in on the real jane do n col meanwhile was thinking very little about her time as janedo she left foste car and was making her own life as an adult she joined the navy she was leaning to flind military helicoptis ad she decided to become a psychologist she says because she wanted to be cowan she felt safe when she was tokeng to him as a kid she was being listened to she wanted to make alther people feel that way she souted acing her psychology classes at night while she trained as a pilot during the day a couple yearsnin to her military service stationed an howayy she got an odd phoncoll from a close family friend said heithere is something going on thers a prive investigator looking for you what did you think oh magash when erth what on earth what is happening now and i knew within moments of hearing the words private investigator that this had something to do with dapes jernal articl it was the only thing she would ever been pato that might be interesting to an investigator she cold colwan who learned loftus was behind it lofta interviewed nichols fastomam form a stepmam family friends who knew her growing up she would even interviewed ncholds bi logical mub and said she might have been wrongly accused nichol hearing about loftis was absolutely not why did you want how to stop i felt intruded upon i felt violated very vulnerable very exposed an an i understand that probably sounds weird given that i had already given dive my consent to publish a story about intimate details of my life but there is a very very big difference between some one asking you to investigate parts of your life and someone doing without your knowledge or permission i did exchange emales with her and i asked her to stop what she was doing and what did she say and many words no did she ask you any direct questions while she was looking into the case no did that strike you as kind of aud it struck me as cime infuriating nicholl complained to loftus his university who told er to stop investigating the jane do case i just got the call from some administrator on my campus say are you looking into this case i said yes on look on the end o this case and a and they came and see to my files i mean i i i could not believe this was happening when when can when can the administrators come to your office and just take your files loftas was eventually cleared and she published her findings on janedub she ogued to the abuse might never have happened of course this was the opposite of what nicholl had believed and clung to since she was seventane lotas printed eight pages worth of doubts in a magazine and cold the audicle who abused jane do when nichol had the oudical was on stand she took a friend from he military base and drove fifty miles to bonds a noble where they stood side by side reading it it was hurtful it was ridiculous to me that someone basically interviewed everyone in my life who had known me when i was a child except me and then when ahad and hach work together this story that just happened to completely support her hypothesis how dar she she just had no right she just had no right to do as she did whos story is this this is not just her story this is this is the falsely accused mothers story this is a whole other people ar part of this story i do not think one person gets to just aside i men i only tell the story one way and only lete people tell it who believe me comuncritically what about the other people in the story i thought i was investigating an accusation against a possibly innocent person i do not think the claim is that you should have just believed her un critically i think i think nichol says that the way that you went around this rac such was tromatizing and demoralizing to herlike sh it made her feel she did not have any control of tha her unrecods and her unch nfidential information from her childhood can you put yourself in her shos thatle can you understand why she feels this was at tresspus i well y as i i mean i think shed she had her away of of telling her story and o and she did not want there to be another way and and thand that might be upsetting for her i do not i it does not seem to me what she was upset by was that there was another way of telling the story i think what she found oupsetting was that you found out who she was and looked into her life without asking her without thinking about her i well do not you think that that that that is what journalist do all the time usually when you write a story about some one you contact them what you asked them what they think of the things that you found out i actually i i i there were times when i would have liked to have talked to her i think i even wrote up some questions that i might ont i ask her but in the and we we decided that it was just too risky risky hout ii just remember there were ging to be conditions and in and hit just made us nervous and we jecided we would just publish what we had found out through many many other sources i and o and and leave it at that and that that is what we did nicholl sued with the help of a lawyer who took our case for free they went off to loftis and everyone who would helped write the articl for twenty one complaints from defamation to invasion of privacy but even though she was angry with loftis nicholl read her article over and over again until something happened that she was not expecting she found herself agreeing with loftis a little it planed ta seeted doubt it did yes what was that to feel is this thing that you have been certain of for long that you felt you had resolution of with doctor colwin and seeing those tapes and then to have it be the subject of doubt again what did that due to you mayme feel very small mamy feel very insignificant as though my opinion on my own the events of my own life r the least important nicholls tot a changing her mind back and forth over and over some day she thought she would been abused o the days she thought she would lied about it i have to say a some one who spent months looking into loftas is articl it is really hard to work out the responsible thing to think when i first read it i rmember thinking game ove there is no way nicholls mamma abused her but as i looked into each claim loft is mad what it seemed a nine on the convincing te scale turned out to me more a foll li loft has found a report from a nothe psychologist who interviewed young nicholl we said she sounded mechanical and reherse when she talked about abuse loft has told me that was the evidence that impressed her most but i do not know he says quot nichol has told her story numerous times to a number of different people and she now sounds mechanical he could mean nicholls lying whl he could just mean she is been ostotell it too many times and lotus intobewed nicholls hat ma'm a woman wh'd been there for the costidy battle she told loftis that she and nicholl's dad had tried to win costody with what she called the sexual angle loft has heard that as sinister but did she accidentally reveald that she would had an angender or did she jisuse sexual angle as an unfortunate shorthand saying we one custody with the abused thing i take the burns loft has found out that nicholl has a fungle condition that makes skin peal a healing burn but there are photoes of young nicholl's feet with big blisters could they be explained by a fonggis it genuinely torments me i still do not know what to think every piece of evidence seems to pinble back and forth this i went mad trying to find out the answer i thought if i read enough court documents i'd finally find the one thing that no one else had the thing that would give me certainty either way of course i did not and nicoll did not either she sat every day in the suspended animation of not knowing court between two really distressing ways of seeing her past in one her mother abused er in the other her father manipulated her into lying and because she lied her innocent mother was cut out of her life and wrongly accused of abusing her child it just created this back in force that i continue to live with to day it did happen it did not happen some days i fall somewhere in between how de sorienting was it to feel you had the truth and then you lost it disreanting is a good word an but it i do not think it fully captures an it goes too my identity it really goes to the heart of who i am and who i thougt i was and who i think i am the most important the key memory on which i rebuilt and then rebuilt again my identity has now been called into question it is just frustrating multiplied by a million it is just frustrating there is and intangible to be gained from the process of transition from being a victim to becoming a survivor and in my case now the suddend i'm an i neither i do not know and i either i i do not know nicolls lorsid against elizabeth loftas dragged on and on over five years all the way out to te california supreme cord in the end nicholl lost the first amendment protected loftas as journalist and nicol had to pay legal fees nearly a quarter of a million dollars which she could not afford the court guanished her military wages she quit the navy whilst two houses and her car was repossessed over all this she filed for bankruptsy these days instead of being stuck between believing she was abused and believing that she was it nicholl's found a third oftion she tries to care a little less she cannot dil down the uncertainty she tries to dial down the stakes i'm never going to know i'm never can know and i even after all these years i think i still fogt that at some point i would come to a solid decision yes or know and really really i'm never going to know and that just has to be o ky thiss much that nicollcot be certain of she ham med out a certainty about herself she found away forward she became a pilot she got two malstes to grees in a peagedy in psychology she is now a therapisst li she is wanted since she was six and she is never caught her mamma out of her life nichollsmamm has always said that she never abuse nicholl she maintains that to day and she says she did not tell michall to lie to child protective services i moms'n has seventies they live in the same state it is not an easy relationship there is a possibility that i ruined my biological mother's life there is a tremendous amount of gilt associated with that we are close fer be relatively close for a period of time and then things sort o fall apart again just as they have when was the last time ho spoke s five months ago and what was a it still it still awkward it is still very pressured if you will o she still wants very much for me to believe that she never did anything to me in and i still do not kno it is it she really really hard to move past that major sort of elephant in the room do you have a tok about it no is she able to accept that you might just non't no no i thinks she really wants me to believe that she did not do you think you could do you think there is anything that could change her mind no the waters are mudy now there is no ll never kno when we hear the other nicholways kno more certain about what happened to day than she was when she was sixteen she never flip to coin and piked something to believe but she landed on a certainty about want to do dot does not rest on want to believe does not matter what the evidenc says she wants her mom o nikward smith aversion of the story is in her new book stop being reasonable how we really change her minds i goe i a aea o provem as o us tay by anya drumming in a manual burrie the people put ar show together includes witn't

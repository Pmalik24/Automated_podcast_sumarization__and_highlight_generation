welcome to the hubermanlapona a science science pace to e fr i man drew hubermen and i'm proprofessor of neurobiology and opthomology at stampord school of medicine to day we are discussing water to some of you water might seem a boring topic but i assure you that water is anything but a boring topic in fact water as a substance is incredibly interesting for a variety of reasons then i'll explain today in fact we are going to discuss the physics and chemistry of water and i promise to make it accessible to any one and every one regardless of whether not you have a physics or chemistry background and i will discuss how your wody needs and utilizes water depending on what type of water you drink the temperature of that water when you drink the water and indeed how you drink that water nowwater is actually a pretty controversial topic in fact in preparing for this episode which took me several months in fact i ran into highly contradictory information and had to go on some real deep dives in order to ferrit out the best and most accurate knowledge for you i also found that there are generally two camps of people out there in terms of how they think about water and the consumption of water one camp generally speaking is of the mine that tap water is completely safe perhaps it needs a little bit of filtering but that in most areas of the world if it runs out of the tap and unless there is a warning sign directly above the fasit that you can drink the tap water the other camp seems to be the camp that does not trust anything that comes out of the tap and is excited by and in fact relies on things reverse osmoses detyrium to pleted hydrogen rich were other forms of water that sometimes can be very expensive or at least involve some substantial steps in order to clean filter alters the chemistry of or in some other way a just before they are willing to consume it to day what we are going to try and do is to address all the stamces around water for instance we will discuss weather r not tap water is indeed safe and i will give you some tools that will allow you to address whether or not the water coming out of your tap is safe as well as some tools that will allow youe to address how to clean that water if indeed it does need filtering and cleaning in particular for things florides and indicrun disrupters which it turns out are quite prominent in he lot not all but a lot of tap water sources i will also talk about the more codencoesoteric forms of water that i mention a few minutes ago i will go systematically through the list of distill the reverse osmoses spring water detyrum to pleted water hyg p h water and for those of you that are already screaming out as you hear this oh no he is going to tell us that p h water can alter the p h of our body and helpful ways i'm not going to tell you that but i will tell you that the alcalinity or acidity of the water that is the p h of the water that you drink has a profound impact on your ability to absorb and utilize that water and the inpact that those water molecules have on specific biological system turns out p h is very important but not for the reasons that you have probably heard about previously i will talk about how the temperature of water that you drink does indeed turn out to be important for the rate of absorbtion of that water and its impact on the cells tissues in organs of your body and thereby your health and i will talk about various zero cost and low cost tools that you can use in order to get the most out of the water that you drink and finally i will talk about when and how to hydrate your bady best before we dive into to day's topic i want a share with you some very interesting results that were just published on the use of deliberate cold exposure to benefit fat loss now deliberate cold exposure is a topice i've covered before in this podcast we have an entire episode about that that i've linked in the shown o captions deliberate cold exposure can be done by way of cold shouers or immersion in cold or ice water up to the neck that is typically on the ways that it is done it has been shown to reduce in flammation to increase metabolism and i think some of the most exciting results that have been published are the results certainly in humans showing that deliberate cold exposure can increase the release of called catacola means which are dopamine nor epineferon and epineperon and those increases in those three molecules are quite long lasting and lead to substantial increases in mood and focus throughout the day now many people out there here about deliberate cold exposure and cringe other people hereabout it and cringe because they have heard that deliberate cold exposure especially by way of immersion in water can block the adaptation to strength or hypertrophe training what i mean by that is yes indeed there are data showing that if one gets into very cold water up to the neck in the six hours any time that is in the six hours after strengh or hypertrophe training that some of the strength and hypertrophy increases that one would observe are blocked by that deliberate cold exposure however after six hours does not seem to be a problem si can be done on other days besides the strength and hypertrophe training it can be done befour strength and hypertrophe training it can be done after indurance work and i should mention that it does not appear that cold shouers distrupt the adaptations to strength and hypertrophe training even if they are done immediately after straingther hypertrophe training oce with that said many people do enjoy the effects of deliberate cold exposure in particular for those increases in mood and elertness that are the consequence of those increases in the catacolameanes jopamean nor upan afferan and epineferon and again those increases are very long lasting sos not just juring the exposure to cold it is for several hours up to for may be even five or six hours depending on how cold and how long the deliberate cold exposure happens to be again there is a loct to say and explore about deliberate cold exposure gen all just refer you to the episode on deliberate cold exposure if you want to explore the mechanisms and the positive health outcomes some of the controversies within the data et cetera within that episode meanwhile i definaly want a share with you the results of this recen study they just came out the title of this study is impact of cold exposure on life's satisfaction and physical composition of soldiures the reason the study is very interesting is that its one of the few studies that used i should say explored both deliberate cold exposure by immersion in cold water as well as deliberate cold exposure by way of cold showers as it relates to weight loss now there is already data out there on the effects of deliberate cold exposure and metabolism and here i'm mainly referring to the beautiful work of doctor susanna soberg an colleagues in skennanavia that showed that people that do eleven minutes total of deliberate cold exposure by immersion in cold water up to the neck per week leven minutes per week total spread out across some different sessions by way of getting into water that is uncomfortably cold up to the neck and then getting out and then doing that several times per week to hit that eleven minutes or more threshold and this is very important will come up in a moment in the contects of this new study and warming up not by getting into a warm shower which is frankly what i do after my cold showers or a getting into the ice bath or cold water immersion but rather forcing their body to warm up naturally by using its own metabolic abilities in those studies they observed substantial increases in brown fat stores which are fat stories that you really want around the heart and claphicals increases in metabolism that were quite dramatic in my opinion and that could be very beneficial for allowing people to feel more comfortable at cold temperatures when they are not in cold water and on and on lots of benefite shown in that study in this study what i thought was particularly interesting is againd they explored both immersion in cold water and cold showers and the duration of cold exposure that they found led to substantial fat loss especialy around the abdomen was very brief deliberate cold exposure let me give you a few details about this study the study involved forty nine subjects that include both males and females this is also really important the beautiful work of susanna soberg and colleagues as far as i know only looked at males thi study looked at males and females they were nineteen to thirty years old and there basily were two groups people are either were assigned to get deliberate cold exposure or they were a not assigned to deliberate cold exposure the form of deliberate cold exposure involved one session per week of cold immersion in cold water up to the neck and to just give you a sense of how cold it was it was three degrees celcius which translates to about thirty seven and a half degrees farrenheit that is pretty darn cold but it was only for two minutes a case o one session at three degree celsius otherwise known as thirty seven point for degrees farrenheit for two minutes every week once a week in addition the same subjects did five cold showers per week or a minimum of five cold showers per week and th ose cold showers were slightly warmer then the immersion in cold water condition they were ten degrees selsius approximately or fifty degrees farenheiht still pretty cold and the duration of that cold water exposure in the shower was just for thirty seconds this is interesting to me because many people do not have access to cold water immersion they might not have an ice bath or any place theycan do that but they most people do have access to a cold shower of some sort plus i think most people could do iblyve one ice bath per week or find a place whre they could get into cold water safely now i should point out that some people will not do well going in to thirty seven point five degree farenheight ake a three degrees selsious water having never done anything this before if you are going to try and employ these sorts of protocals that were used in the study i do recommend they easen to it over the course of a week or and become somewhat adapted to the the shock of cold water exposureso may be started it you fifty degrees farenheight can a easier way back in terms of the cold water immersion especially now another critical feature of this study is as with the beautiful work by susanna soberg the subjects were cold to warm up naturally after the delierate cold exposure they basely hung out outside of the cold water immersion are outside of the cold shower for ten minutes after they were exposed to the cold in their bathing sut or am assuming they were wearing something a but the point is that you are not going from deliberate cold exposure directly into a hot shower or a saner something of that sort again their bodies were forced to heat up again naturally after the deliberate cold exposure but after the ten minute period they were able to do whatever they wanted assentially reclothe take a warm shower an on a go about their day now the results of this deliberate cold exposure protocal again two minutes in cold immersion at three degrees selsios thirty seven point fidegrees farenheight plus five cold showers per week of two minutes long lobit warmer ten degrees celsios fifty degrees farenheight now the deliberate cold exposure used in the study caused many different statistically significant positive changes they had a very extensive question here that related to mood everything from levels of anxiety to sexual satisfaction and on and on in fact they saw a a sstatistically significant improvement in sexual satisfaction in the subjects that were exposed to deliberate cold exposure not in the controld group although they did not look at this chances are those improvements and sexual satisfaction were the downstream consequence of the known increases in testosteron and free testostrone that occur in both men and women who do the sorts of deliberate cold exposure again testostrom being im portant hormon for libido in both men and women they also saw improvements in regulation of anxiety which i think its very interesting given that the deliberate cold exposure often causes people anxiety but here and in other studies we have seen it can lead to and at betterability to buffer against anxiety in the normal happenings of everyday life perhaps the most interesting and significant results tof they found in the study however were that in particular in men there was a reduction in waste cir cumference following eight weeks of this deliberate cold exposure as well as a five point five per cent on average five point five per cent reduction in abdominal fat that was quite statistically significant when compared to the other groups now why there was no observed reduction in abdominal fat or wasteir comference in the female subjects is n't clear could have to do with just the way that a body fat is is stored in metabolized in females vorses males that is going to be a topic for future exploration i do thnk the study as very interesting because when you look at the landscape of science in di scussion around deliberate cold exposure i thin there is a general concensus now that deliberate cold exposure can change one cents of mood and well being through the increases in catacolmeans that i mentioned earlier but the impact on metabolism itself has been somewhate controversial because the over all changes in metabolism that are observed while statistically significant in many studies have not ever really been shown to translate into weight loss or body fat loss in any kind of specific way and of course a great advantage of this study is that by exploring soldiers they were able to really hold constant a number of other features the amount of daily activity that those soldieres are exposed to their diets theire living conditions and on and forth at least in far as human studies are done itt it is a very well controled study will provide a ling to the studying the shownoe captions and for those of you that are thinking about employing the protocol that is used in this a particular paper or combining it with existing deliberate cold exposure protocals to me it seems pretty straight forward and of pretty minimal time and vestment juse two minutes of deliberate cold exposure by way of water immersion up to the neck and five times a week of thirty seconds each of deliberate cold exposure by way of cold showerand just a quick mention about cold showers if you are going to use cold showers to yo deliberate cold exposure you are going to want to stand under the shower itself rigt and sincely have it hit your head the back your neck and your upper back which us wear most of your brown fat stores are concentrate entrance out that cold exposure to those regions of the body in particular are going to trigger the adaptation of increase brown fat stores which involves increases am mit a conjure in those fat again this is not the blubbery fat beneath the skin this is the fat that acts as kind of an oail in the furnace that is a your thermogenic properties of your body to generate heat and burn off calld white atapost tissue elsewhere in the body now any one that understands the laws of physics and thermodynamics will be saying weight in order to get fat loss you need to have a coloric dephacit callories ind calories out still applies and yes that is absolutely true we can only conclude on the basis of the results of the study that the people that lost body fat were indeed in a chloric dephisit presumably because all other factors were held more or less constant in this scroup of soldiers presumably because the deliberate colld exposure itself elevated metabolism thereby increasing the calories out component of the calories in calries out equaion which of course governs the ruls of weight loss and body fat loss as well before we begin i'd to emphasized this podcast is separate fom my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desiron effort to bring zero costoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponser is element element is an electrolite drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called nurons in fact in order for your nurons to function properly all three electrolites need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolike concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisits ind cognitive and physical performance element contains a science bactolectrolite ratio of one thousand miligrams that one grahm of sodium two under milegrams of potassium and sixty miligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if i've been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doccom slash hubermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element eleement doccom slashhubermen let us talk about water and let us start off by answering the questien what is water water is of course h too most everybody knows that from an early age but what h tuo means is that eh molecule of water consists of two hydrogens and one oxygen an the physical arrangement of those to hydrogens and one oxygen turns out to be really important for how water functions in the body and frankly elsewhere in our world and life if you were to make a piece symbol that is to put up your index finger and your middle finger simultaneously factomon a recommend you do that now unless you are using your hands for something else important which case do it later if you make that piee symboln you look at yor hand you have a pretty good impression of what an individual water molecule consists of which is h toot two hydrogens and an oxygen and with that piee symbol the fingers here are the tipsier fingers rather are going to represent hydrogens your fingers that is the length of each of those fingers is going to represent the electron bonds to the oxygen and the palm of your hand and the fingers that are down are going to represent the oxygen now what is important about that visual impression or visual image of the individual water molecule is that it is polarized that is the hydrogens over on one side both of them are over on one side and the oxygen is over on another and what is really important about water molecules being polrized is that they can bind to one another by way of that polarization and this has to do with something that we all kind of learned in chemistry at one point but many of us forgot if we deem n't understand at the first time around which is that positives and negatives attract when you have individual water molecules they have the opportunity to interact and essentially bind to one another and they bind through what are alled covalent bonds covailent bonds are relatively weak bonds and as a consequence water can change its conformation however covailent bonds are strong anough that water actually can maintain some structure and that structure will vary of course depending on its temperature what you need to know about water is that indeed it consists of lots of individual h to oes and those eight shooes can arrange themselves in different ways nd that temperature is a strong determinant of the arrangement of those water molecules that is their bonding to one another and in fact even their spacing between those bonds again even if you do not have any chemistry stay with me because you will definitely understand this water can exist in at least three forms and may be for forms we know that it can be liquid of course really normally what we think of when we think of water it can be gas suathing of steam writes to heated up it takes on a a not a semi solid or a semi liquid form it takes on this property of steam or gas ochaosa when you see steam or when you o breathe on a cold day threuour mouth with reeur knows and you sea your air thos are water molecules that are condensing that is bonding in certain ways based on differences in temperature betwee the inside your body and the outside air and of course it can be a solid it can be ice now ice is fascinating and important in understanding how water works and this will become relevant later when we think about how water works within the body is well especially how different temperatures of water impact the health an behaviour of ourselves and the most important point to understand about water in its solid state is that unlike most substances when water is in its solid state it is actually less dense than when it is in its liquid state ust think about that most substances most metals for instance when they are in a solid state they are more dense than when they are in a liquid states for instance if theyre in a solid state they will sink in a container filled with their liquid form not water water is very interesting because as you cool water and water transitions from a liquid to a solid it still binds that is it form bonds between those different molecules of water but the spacing between those h two ot again those piece symbols with hands to get a bunch of those if you had thousand hands all making p symbols they can bond to one another but when it is cold those bonds are actually made further apart from one another and as a consequence ice as we all know floats in water in other words put very simply water is unusual and special in that in its solid form ice it is actually less dense than when it is in its liquid form and that is why ice floats in water now this is important not just are our biology but to all of life because if you think about it if it were not the case that water is less dense in its solid form ice than it is in its liquid form the bottoms of our oceans would be covered with thick sheets of ice and if that were the case you can be absolutely sure that life would not exist on our planet the way they does and there is a good chance that we would not exist as a species because much of what allows us to exist on the this planet and the other animals to exist on this planet relies on photosynthesis pathways in plants that are dependent on the sun and interactions with the oceans and lakes and other bodies of water and of course the ice caps are vitally important that is the presence of ice especially at the poles but elsewhere in bodies water as well that icebergs are critical part of the ecosystem that allows for everything from photosynthesis to the ability of certain animals to extract food from each other and from their local resources now there is whole discussion to be had there but the importnt point for now is that the physical properties of the bonds between water that ar made and change depending on temperature turn out to be essential for us to be present on this planet at all and for our sells to function in the ways that they do for sake of health and for sake of disease will explore this later when we talk about the critical relationship between temperature p h which is the relationship between alcalinity how basic or acidity how acid a given liquid or in the scases werme tik about water is and the ways that aur sells can or cant use water i realize that this is a fairly indepth for those of you that do not have much of a background and chemistry ove tried to keep it really top contour but if you can make a piece symbol or if you can just imagine a piece symbol in your mind and realize that that is a water moleculean tht those water molecules combined to one another through bonds that are relatively strong but weak enough that they can be broken if they need to and that the temperature that those water molecules are exposed to changes the distance between those bonds and that is what allows ice to float in water then you are goingto have no problem with the remainder of the discussion to day in fact you will also have the ability to understand things that you have obser rved many times over but perhaps hafe never thought about were realy understood which are for instance that water has a certain level of surface tension for instance if you have ever been to the ocean and the waves are coming in what you will notice is if you walk on the dry sand or gravel of pebbles that is of the ocean it is very easy right am ming the pebbles move down or the sand moves down it depresses low bit due to the weight of your body but as you get closer to the water you'r goingto sink deeper because that sand is more saturated with water but at's some point you will not be able to actually walk on top of the water right it has been said that jesus walked on water there is the socl jesus christ lizard named because it can actuly walk on the surface of water a leaf can float on the surface of water under some conditions a coin can float on the surface of water if you mak coffee in the morning you can actually take a spoonful of that hot coffee and pour little bit on the surface of your coffing you will notice that it will beat up and i you will get little a round spheres of water those are little water molecules bound to one another that spin on top of the surface before they sink under that has everything to do with the bonding between water that is dependent on temperature but also as with the difficulty for sentially everybody at to walk on water were for animals to walk on water the surface tension of water allows certain things to float there or to stay at the surface but there is a very thin layer of water molecules at the surface of water that are more dense then the water that resides at deeper depths and that is why most things including us sink in water we are more dense than water now i did mention earlier that there are three forms of water theteis the once that we all are familiar with the solid liquid in gas forms of water however there are data mainly from geral polics laboratory at the universa washington thathave described the called fourth phase of water which is structured water nd will get into thi sylobit later because structured water has really been a prominent topic in the let us call it the a water health of pycianatoes it is a heavily debated topic as to whether not structured water is somehow better for ourselves if it exists within our bodies will get into that on in full detail later but the whole notion of structured water is that in the presence of sertain solids or certain liquids the confirmation of water that is the water mlecules actually change somewhat this has been demonstrate whether not has relevants to the biological function of our body is a different issue but we know that there is this fourth phase of water called structured water structured water a is a fairly complicated topic but we can make it very simple for sake of today's discussion i mention earlier that opposite pulls a tract that is positives and negatives attract and tipically ofm things that are negatively charge when presented with another negative charge either repel or do not attract things that are posively charge in the presence of another positive charge also tend to repel this is the basis of magnets o either a sticking to one another repelling fror one another anthere is also the idea that human beings who are opposites attract with us a different episode that we need to do in the future the point here is that structured water is a unique condition in which the local environment that these water molecules happen to be in a lows positive charges between different water molecules to attract one another again whereas normally its positive an negatives that attract in the configuration that we call structured water positives and positives attract and form bonds that are stronger than the typical bonds that would be formed between water molecules and just as it kind of prelude to our discrustion about structured water as it may or may not relate to health later there are a number of people that believe that within the body because of the presence of certain liquids an solids that the water within our cells and a precular within the interactions with caled organels organals are things might accondria am the gold g apparatus they fancy namesies of these are the things within cells that allow cells to do everything from make protines to traffic protines out to the surface of cells ings nor transmitters and recepters and on a lot of people who are interested in structured water as it relates to biological function have i pothesized or to debate rather whetheror not in the body water is not just present in its liquid form or gashous form we know it is not present in its solid form an les u gulp down some icecubes for instance but there is a cohort of people out ther including some fairly accomplish scientists that believe that within the body the organels of our cells act as a substrahte for water to exist in this fourth form this structured water form and that is led to this whole nichindustry of people am who are proponents of consuming called structured water again will get to that a lobit later now what individual water molecules consist of when you heare h to o ho fleell get that a visual image in your mind of an individual water molecule bein the piece symbol and a bunch of those binding to one another through these a relatively weak bonds but strong enough that certain things can take place surface tension a keep in mind that surface tention of water may relate to either standard bonds between water or this fourth phase a that is heavily debated still a but we certainly know that am for incs if you are to take a piece of wax paper or glass and you are to poursome water on it you would notice that the water would beat up or kind o aggregate at particular locations when you see that beating up or the aggregation of water molecules on a paricular surface youre sing two things especially am and a fun the next tem you see it you will know that the the aggregation the beating up of water with itself individual water molecules are many water molecules can aggregating one location of making a beat of water that is do to these bonds these covailent bonds occurring between water molecules but also you will notice that on a vertical pain of glass say in rain or on your wind shield that the water will look almost at sticking to the glass and that is because theyare actio ly bonds between the water molecules that to beat et up themselves and the glass water can not just bind to itself it can also byind to certain surfaces and the fact that perhaps if you drive your car if you were to tap the window or if a big enough bead of water formed on a window that it would start to drip down that is because those bonds with the surface are strong but there not strong that it stick at that location quite different then water that is in its solid form ice that can actually really ad here if you have ever had to scrape ice off a wind shield fas you live in a cold regions you are familiar with tis ave scrape ice off winshildy realize that the bonds between waterin its solid form in different servaces is quite a bit stronger than the bonds between different water molecules with each other or the bonds between water and different surfaces when they are warmer i do realize that for a lot of people listening that is going to be a pretty deep dive into the chemistry and physical properties of water but all you really need to know is that these water molecules are incredibly versatile and cand bind to each other and can bind a different surfaces and can allow things to float or to sink or even to move across surfaces of water based on the three perhaps four different o states that water can be in and that versatility that you observe in the natural world on window panes and rain and clouds and hail and ice and snow and scraping ice off your windshield in the cold of winter and perspiration and on all of that is fine and good but realize that almost all of those same sorts of properties of water become extremely relevant when thinking about how your body actually utilize thas water and the ky thing here is that temperature and the called alkalinity or a city thatis the p h of water turn out to be very important determinants of how water is used by the cells of your body in fact is all describe in a moment we have entire sets of biological mechanism solely devoted to trying to get water into our cells in very specific ways including at specific rates and to use water in different ways because as you have probably heard before we are mostly water what is kind of interesting to me and what i found researching this episode is that the percentages of our cells and bodies that are a prorported to be water is a pretty broad range some people say were fifty five percent water other peoplese thy were seventy per cent water because thy were ninety five per cent water the exact percentage does not matter much and really just boils down to whether not the person that stating that percentage is talking about how much water is present in our cells and body at a given moment verses how much water was involved in the process of creating the sorts of proteenes and other things of our body that are required to have haircells skin cells brain cells et cetera if you really want a number out there i cannot give you a single number if you want to be accurate its can have to be arrange and basically we are anywhere from seventy per cent and ninety per cent water depending on how you define being water that is whether not your talking about water being present in cells and its liquid form or may be in this fourth structure water form if youre on of the mind that that exists within us and whether or not youre talking about water that was used to create a given protene a receptern or transmitter or whether not your talking about the water just being water as h to o again it is very easy to go down that rabbit hole in this is on part of the reason whe their such a wi discrepancy of assertions as to how much of us as water but let us be direct most of our body is water and there is not a single other molecule in the universe that we can look to and say that t has as important o roll in our health in biology and frankly our presence of life on earth at all then water i'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic grens now called g one is a vitemen mineral probiotic drink that covers all f your foundational nutritional neens i've been taking athletic green since two thousand in twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the podcast thereason i starte taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athltic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to be the probiotics that i need for got health our got is very important its populated by gup microbioda that communicate with the brain the mun system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health and those probiotics an athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition athletic grens contains a number of adaptogens vitements and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste gright if you to triathletic greens you can go to athltic green stock calm slash hubermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et cetera and they will give you a year supply of vitemen d thre k too againd that' athletic green stockcalm slash hubermen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitemind thre k to o ca now at a minimum everyone out there should understand that water has a particular structure s when we hear h to o in ciund of imagine that structure and that the water molecules can change their confirmation that is they conbined other water molecules and it turns out they can bind to other things and achally change the confirmation of other things a good example of that something were all familiar with which is water's ability to dissolve certain substances sugar or salt and that is because salt molecules ar sugar molecules are what we call hydrophilic they water and when we say they water it just means that the chemical structure of salt sodium where the chemeraconstructure of sa sucros table sugar can actually interact with the hydrogens in oxygens of water and can change those salt molecules or sugar molecules turning them from solid into liquid essentially creating what are called solutes whichars basily the the undissolving of solids into a liquid solutions in fact water is one of the best solvants on the planet in fact water is better at dissolving many solids than is acid that is how incredible water is and ther number of reasons relate to the chemistry of water that can explain that but as we transition from talking about the physics and chemistry of water to how water actually behaves within our body and contributes to our health or to disease depending on the case it is important understand that molecules such as sugar and salt can be hydrophilic or s we know oil in water to mix that is because oils lipids are called hydrophobic what is hydrophobic wohuld just thing phobic certain molecules such as lipids do not dissolve well in water and we all intuitively understand that if you take some olive oil for instance and you put it into glass of water i likely float or beat up or form lill spherical or a mebut shapes within the water and that is because oil lipids are hydrophobic different substances out there are either going to be more hydrophilic that is they are going to a have a greater propensity to interact with water and bind with the diferent aspects of the water molecules or hydrophobic to have less of o propensity to interct with and bine with water mlecules and i am sore been alluding to this numerous times throughout this podcast already the temperature of water and the p h that is the alcalinity oracidity of water we will have a strong impact on weather r not a hydrophilic or hydrophobic substance we will have a greater or lesser tendency to interact with water you all know this intuitively as well if you have ever tried to dissolve a say a big tablespoon of sugar in very cold water you will notice that the grains do not dissolve as quickly as when you take that big tablespoon of sugar and put it into a warm or hot cup of water nd that is because the temperature of water actually changes how well that sugar molecule is able to change its confirmation and interact with the water molecules likewise if you want to get something that is really hydrophyilic into an aqueous that is a water containing solution the temperature is also going to strongly impact that now there are a near infinite number of examples of how temperature and p h impact the tendency of hydrophylic and hydrophobic substances to dissolve in water or not we are not gonito going to all those details but as we migrate from our discussion about the physics and chemistry of water into how water behaves within our body which is what we are ging to do now and then as we continue into the third part of our discussion which is wy and how certain types of water that some of your fam iliar with different peage water r distilled water reverse sausemosis wate wy those different types of water are thought to and in some cases do in fact change the ways that our cells function for better for worse all of that will come together and make cens for you o case all the cells of your body every cell even your bones that is the ostio blasts in the other cells within your bones your bone marrow your red blood cells your white blood cells your nur ons your nerve ells your liver cells are kidney cells all of them require water in order to get the proper amount of water into those cells theyre basicly two ways that water can access tho cells now we zume out for a second and ask yourseles how does water actiol get into the body most of us just think oat will we drink that water into our body course that is the main way we can also breathe water molecules in torbody through humid air when you hydrate your cells that is when you are bringing water into your cells that water needs to move from your got and into the blood stream and eventually into the individual cells whatever cell type that may be and there basily two ways that water can access those cells the first way has been known about for a very long time and that is called diffusion now the outside of most cells is made up of fatty stuff lipid for instance nuron's nerve cells have a lipid bylayer it is two layers of fat and you already know that fat lipid is very hydrophobic now that turns out to be not a problem but a solution for how water can get across that lipid barrier why it is the fact that water can change its confirmation and lipids can change their confirmation just enough that the bonds between water and the bonds betreen those hydrophobic lipids can interact allowing the water molecule to basically pass through the lipid because it can bond very weakly or in some cases not at all but very weakly to those lipids and then be pushed through to the other cide really incredible if you think about it if there was too much of a hydrophobic relationship between the lipid and the water the water would come up to the surface of that of that fatty outside of of our cells and then would be repelled away from it oror just stay theire right at the surface and that would be no good because we actually need that water to diffuse across the cell membranes or it athals a double cell mem brane as i mention before two layers water and lipids of cells can interact with just enough affinity that the water molecule can diffuse across those cell mem brane barriers but this is an important but the diffusion of water molecules across those lipid barriers on te outsides of cells is a fairly slow process compared to the other way that water access of cells and this other way that water access os cells is really something that was just discovered about ten years ago this is a fairly recent discovery but trn us to be a fundamental discovery which is the presence of what are called aqua pouring channels oquaporn channels are basidly portals through the membrane that a low water molecules to move very quickly across cell membranes at a rate of about one million egh to os one million water molecules per second and the way that water molecules move across the cell membrane throug those oqueporn channels is very interesting the inside of those channels and h wey think of these as there literally tubes stuck through the membranes of cells the insides of those channels are very hydrophobic allowing those water molecules to just jut really quickly almost as if in your mind you cu just imagineas if it was were lubricated for the water lets not really lubricated the the water mlecules can move through in single flou a million per second now why would you need two ways for water to get across cell membraes one fairly slow through basic diffusion and again diffusion folks is the movement of things from a gradiants of higher concentration to lower concentration which just think about this as things tend to run down hill from higher concentration to lower concentration they trying create equilibrium aacross space you nog yet a bunch of marbles on one side of a of a box there am just imagine that these were water molecules because of the charges between those a hydrogens and oxygens there is ha tendency for those a marbles to spread out and a centially take on a fairly even conformation that is basely just diffusion across a space water molecules will also move from higher concentration to lower concentration across cell membranes and then you have these portals these tubes ore these channels as theyre call these oqueporn channels were water molecules can move very quickly now the reason why biolegy seems to have created these oqueporn channels and again i was not consult tet the design phase but the most logical explanation is that we have many tissues within our body that often need water very quickly or need to release water very quickly let us think about a couple of these and then let us look at what the acual distribution of oqueporn channels is throughout the body what is an area of your body that on occasion will need to move water very quickly out of it use your imagination here but i'll just tell you that for instance your teer glands are teer ducks need to release tiers very quickly you need to take water that stored in your body if thereis an emotional experience or if a you look at a very bright light for instance a or of yo god forbid if you get some 'm sort of irritant in your eyrgn start to tier up and those tirs are the release o fluid from those tier ducks and it is going to be the very rapid release of water a from those tier ducks through called oqueporn channels and in fact oqueporn channels are heavily express their many of them in the cells of the call lacromo glands that release tiers in addition we need to absorb water from the gut and the gut has a lining and etheoleal lining andother sellinis mucosil lining and water needs offinto move very quickly from ar stomach into the rest of the body and one way that is accomplished is through ocoporin channels that are expressed all along your gut the discovery these aqoporn channels is really highly significant in terms of understanding the different ways that water can interact with and get into the cells of your body ow there are ocoporn channels notjus in the lacrmo glands that allow for tering or within the gut but in many tissues within your body and there even have differnt distributions within those tissues in fact as one looks at the expression of the different ocoporn channels cause it turns out their different forms of them across all the cells and tissues of the body there is really no single tissue within the body except perhaps the bones of your body and perhaps the ligaments to some extent that do not have these ocoporin channels some of you out there may have heard of the called fasia fasia and sheathe muscels wher unique kind of connective tissue that on give some pliability and yet some rigidity that allow for a lot of the on physical abilities of your muscoskeletal systemits incredible tissue will do an entire episode about fassia at some point fascinating fascinating tissue fasia even contain ocoporin channels the roll of ocoporn channels in faia probably relates to are were specific needs to be able to use specific muscle groups in particular ways at particular times in other words if you'r sleeping our lying down are sitting you are not using your muscul scellital system as much as if your running or performing some repetitive behaviour turns out that the ocoporn channels in certain tissues the fasia can be used when we transision from low mobility states to himobility states allowing more profusion or access of water into particular cells of the body when we need it such as fascinating fascinating a channels these acoporin channels again only discovered fairly recently were still learning new things about our biology all the time now in a very important feature of the ocoporin channel is that the movement of water molecules across the sell membran through those ocoporin channels is strongly dependent on the temperature of water and the p h of water this becomes especially important our description and ore deep dive into called alcaline water or higher p h water a little bit later but i'll just give you a little teaser for now because i'm sure that a number of people ar are wondering about this if you go into the store or even a convenient store you will see p h water now every water has a p h right lower numbers mean more citic higher numbers mean more alcaline or more basic you will see p h water that is seven point for you will see seven point eight you will see nine point eight u'a fuge range of tese things and there are many many different claims about how the p h of water is important for regulating the p h of the body ers the real story the p h of your body that is the p h of the cells at different locations in your body is strongly strongly homeostatically regulated what i mean by that it means it does not change that much which means that you have very specific biological mechanisms that in sure the p h is maintain for instance in the skin cells of your skin in the retinal cells of your eye in your brain cells now it is true that across the body different cells and tissues have fairly widely varying p h now it has been said that the p h of bodily tissues is generally between seven point to in seven point for however if you were to look at the p h of your gut and keep in mind that your got his not just your stomach your gut is the entire pathway arranging from your throat all the way down a to where you excret things out of your body that entire pathway has different p h levels depending on where you are along the gut an intestinal pathway and in fact having much lower that is more acitic p h at certain locations along your gut pathway is what allows those gut micro bioda those a little micro organisms of which you have triliuns that are important for regulating everything from your transment or production to hormon production that allow them to flourish and do well that said accept under conditions of hemorhage or a changes in blood volume that are of a dangerous level that can lead to ceizure r even death the p h of the rest of the cells of your body and also those gut cells does not change that much on a moment moment basis if somebody tells you that you should drink alkaline water or alcanalized water as it sometimes called in order to keep your body more alkaline and less acitic there is essentially no basis for that at a macroscopic level or even at a local level ow what that does not mean is that the p h of the water that you drink is not important in fact if the p h of the water that you drink is too low that is if the water that you consume is too acitic it will not move as quickly from your gut into the other regions of your body and therefore the other cells of your body that require that water will not be able to access it as readily you probably experience this if youve consume certain water in it feels it slashing around in your stomach or it feels its am just somehow staying there or you feel it its presence more not just as volume but it is almost as if you can feel e little waves of water along the inside of your gut now sometimes that can relate to temperature but oftentimes that can relate to the p h of that water and it turns out it is true that water that is more alkaline that is p h is of seven point for or higher can move more readily across the alcopor in channel and in terms of absorption of water from the endotheola lining in the other celtype lining of your gut into the rest of your body it is true that hyer p h water provided that p h is in too high is going to be absorbed more quickly which partially explains why some people have an affinity for this hyer p h water now this is not to say that you need to consume high p h water in order to hydrate your body properly i won to be very clear about that however if you are interested in what the value of elevated p h water is it largely has to do with this eccelerated absorption and as will talk about a littl bit later there is also growing evidence that it can adjust the function of certain cells that are within your imune system and thereby reduce certain inflammatory responses i realize as i'm saying this some people out there apot you thing oh no this sguies a p h water proponent he is saying we have to drink alkaline water or by very fancy water now i want to be clear that is not what i'm saying and i'm also not saying that you need to purchase very expensive water in order to derive the maximum benefitfrom the water that you drank a trins out there are few things thatyou can do by way of temperature end by way of philtering water and a few other tricks that i'll tell you a lo bit later that will allow you to increase the absorption rate of water in the gut which turns out to be a very interesting but also potentially important thing to do for not just reducing inflammation but also making sure that you are etting proper hydration of different cel types in your body including rapid hydration of your brain cells which as we also talk about in a few moments can greatly enhance cogniive function o case of we have talked about how water can get into cells their two ways diffusion and movement through these ocoporn channels we oure marked the discussion that the temperature and the p h of water that is the confirmation of water and here i really want to imbed this in people's minds that when we talk about temperature of water and p h of water were really talking about the arrangement of those h to os those water molicules to keep that in mind we have covered how water can get in to cells through those two diferent ways diffusion in through the ocoporn channels what we have not talked about is what happens to water once its incells and this is very simple to explain once water is inside of cells it is going to be incorporated into the different protines and organells again organeles ore things mitocondrea the nucleas of the cells which stains the dana and forth in different ways depending on which protines are there and how hydrophilic or hydrophobic those protines are or in some case are not that is an entire landscape of protine to water specific interactions none of which we need to go into in any specific detail now but the one thing that we do need to realize and keep in mind as we go forward is that many of the biological processes in our body that involve the movement o molecules such as water and interactions with protines are goi ing to involve the bonding or lack of bonding between water molecules and protens and any time we are talking about bonding of one thing to the next at the level of chemistry or biology for that matner caus are really the same thing we are talking about whether r not there are electhons present or whether or not there are charges that are opposite or the same and on and on if you have ever heard of called reactive oxygen species what are are oesses are reactive oxygen species or called free radicals or anti oxidents all of that is really just describing the presents ar apens of charges that are bound or unbound for instance if you hear about free radicals sounds pree wildright free radicals what are free radicals free radicals can damage cells they do not always damage cells but they can damage cells because they are essentially free electrons they are a charge that sitting out there not bound to anything and therefore can interact with the molecular structure of certain protenes and change those structures by binding to them or interfering with the normal binding processies of those protines to water or to other things and in that way cause damage to those protenes and potentially damage to cells now fortua ly our sells have ways to deal with those free radicals and those are called antioxidents antioxidents are molecules that can arrive in different forms sometimes we think of antioxens as vitemens but they are also present in other things as well that essentially bind up those free radicals or repair the bonds between cells that the protines are no longer undergoing these let us just call them bad conformations that damage the functioning of our cells there are many different theories of aging there are many differen theories of disease but there is not a single disease either of brain or body that does not in some way involve the generation of what are called reactive oxygen species these free radicals and the damaging of cells at the level of their individual organels and forth nors there are single disease of brain or body that has not been shown to benefit from having some anti oxydent interference get in the way of that oxydative process i realize to day is pretty thick with noming clature a for those of you that have not already realize it what you are learning here is organic chemistry a you can feel pretty good about the fact that if you can understand the water molecule and i understand a little bit about what a a free electron is which is basely a charge that is out there that a can potentially do damage and the interactions of things reactive oxygen species and the ability of of stable bonds to a buffer against or or repair certain damage to cells as we are describing it here well then what your essentially thinking about and what were talking about as organic chemistry now since this is a discussion about chemistry a as a service to try and understand the biological effects of water keep in mind that water itself believe it or not can act as an anti occident provided that it is bonding to things in the proper way which requires that it get into cells in the proper amounts and rates which requires that the temperature and p h of that water be correct and provided that there is enough water there and that that water is not bound to other things is not containing solutes that are damaging an potentially that it is carrying some of the good things such as sodium or that there is potassium present again the called electrolites that allow cells to function well cay om that is a bit of a trench of information and i do not want people to get overwhelmed or confused what i'm trying to do here is paint a picture of the biology of water understanding that when you injust water drinking it down or when you breathe water vapors in the steam room or on a human day that wateris entering your system its accessing your cells through these two mechanisms diffusion across cell membranes removement throughocoporn channels and then once inside those cells it is able to interact with and change the conformation of different protines and eccelerate or slow down different celler reactions everything from normal metabolism to blood pressure to damage cells depending on a number of different features of that water as well as what the cells happen to be doing in any given moment with that in mine i to turn our attention to how water depending on its temperature its p h how much we drink or how little we drink when we drink that water et cetera how that can impact the health disease and repair of different cells tissues and organs of our body let us talk about how much water or more generally speaking how much fluid each and all of us should drink each day and how much fluid to drink depending on our specific activities and environment now this is perhaps the most commonly asked question when the topic of water comes up how much water do i ney to drink the other thing that comes up is a question which is cannot we just follow our natural thirst that is cannot we just pay attention when we are thirsty and then drink fluids and then that leads to the other question which is does the color of our urine provide any indication as to whether or not we are under hydrated overhydrated or hydrating correctly me answer each of these things wan at a time and in the back drop i want to hilate the fact that there are many many if not doesens hundreds of studies pointing to the fact that when we are dehydrated our brain does not function as well and our body does not function as well what i'm attempting to do in that statement is throw a net around the enormous number of studies that have shown that even a slight state of dehydration even two per cent dehydration can lead to a significant and meaningful impact that is a negative impact on our bi lity to for instance carry out endurance type behaviors or ability to a run on a tread mill and stop at the point where we feel cannot continue is going to be negatively impacted that is we will be able to perform less work for less period of time when we are even slightly dehydrated likewise our strength is reduced by even slight dehdration likewise our cognive performance including memory focus creative thinking flexible thinking of different kinds are all significantly impaired when we are in states of dehyration now that raises an additional question that deserves attention which is how o we have she measure dehydration now you hear diffrent things if you pinch the skin on te top your hand and it takes more than three seconds to a lay down again flat than your dehydrate you hear that you hear ocay if you are to a press on your finger nail and see a change in the color of the tissue just below your finger nail which indeed does happen and it does not go back to its original color within one to three seconds than your dehydrate you hear things this if your ankles are swollen when your wearing socks you take off the socks and you can see the imprint of the socks on your a lower limbs that means your dehydrate you hear this kind of stuff and you should probably be wondering as any of that true to some extent it is true although it can herry quite a bit by how old you are whether not your on the skin on the top your hand tends to be looser or not panning on wether at your leaner or not in other words those are not absolutely objective measures of dehydration now it is true that if normally you can pinch the skin on the top of your hand and it returns to its normal flattend position within about one to two or three seconds and it does not do that within five or more seconds there is a decent probability that your little but dehydrate that you need to ingestsome fluid or that if you press down on your nail and you see the depression a causes a a transition from and of a pink color to a white color and then you release and it does not go back to its original pinkish color within a few seconds well then there is a chance that your dehydrate but again these are not perfect measures of dehydration you may be surprised to learn and i was surprised to learn that most of the basis for these statements even a two per sent dehydration state can lead to significant reductions and cognive or physical performance are based on not direct measures of hydration but rather a measures of reductions in water intake which is a different thing right it saying that ordinarily a person of a given bodyweight needs ex amount of fluid per day and when they get even just to percent less than that amount of fluid then there cognitive and or physical performanceis impaired rather then focussing on dehydration of tissues now that might seem a u'msubtle distinction but it is actially a meaningful distinction when you think about it however it is a meaningful distinction that we can leverage toward understanding how much water or fluid we need to drink each day now there we can really point to some solid numbers that beleave it ore not are fairly independent of body weight now i say independent of body weight i am referring to the amount of fluid that most healthy adults need at rest what i mean by at rest i mean when not exercising and when not in extremely hot environments i'm leaving aside you a desert ultra marithoners or people that ar doing any kind of movement or living in environments that are very very hot here i am mainly refering to people that live most of their daily life in indore environments could be our condition are not oir condition heated are not heated wet we are trying to arrive at here are some numbers that can work across the board because of course there are an infinite number of different conditions that each in all of you are existing in i am not going to attempt to give you a body weight by activity by environent by humidity formula calculation in fact no such calculation exists however there are formulas that can put you into very stable frameworks that is levels of water intake for periods of rest when you are not exercising and for when you are exercising that will insure that you are hidrating with the one exception being if you are exercising or if you are living in very very hot conditions and youre not heat adapted to those conditions what are those numbers in other words what is the answer to the question of how much fluid we need each day and here i am referring to fluid i'm not distinguishing between water calfinated beverages soda tea and on i'll discuss that in a moment we can reasonably say that for every hour that you are awake in the first ten hours of your day this is important in the first ten hours of your day you should consume on average eight ounces of fluid now for those of you that are using the metric system not ounces eight ounces of fluid is approximately two hundred and thirty six mill leaders of water and for those of you that exist in the metric system and are not used to think about ounces and vice versa tus tene about a typical can of soda in the united states is twelve ounces in europe sometimes tae cands of soda are lil but smaller that is tha whole discussion unto itself but eight ounces of fluid that is two hundrad and thirty six lishes say two hundred and forty milliersks we do not need to be two precise here of fluid on average every hour for the first ten hours of your day which translates to an average of eighty ounces of fluid for the first ten hours of your day or two thousand three hundred and sixty mill leaders of water in other words approximately two leaders of water pluss a little bit more for the first ten hours of your day now i want to be very cle er that this does not mean that you need to in jest eight ounces or two hundred and thirty six millr yors of fluid on the hour every hour for the first ten hours of your day am certainly not saying that and in fact most people are going to find that they are going to injest water in bolaces that is they re gong to have on perhaps sixteen ounces of water five hundred milliars of water one portion of the day and there may be a couple hours of later they will drink some more water or some more coffee or soda or some other beverage an another portion of the day i do think however it is important for most of us to take a step back and ask ourcelves whether not independent of any other activity or environmental conditions whether not we are in fact in jesting eighty ounces or pisicly two point four leaders of water for that ten hours of the day that spands from the time we wake up until ten hours later now whyma is setting this ten hour framework the reason i'm setting this ten hour framework is that it turns out that your fluid requirements even just at rest are vastly different in the time from when you wake up until about ten hours later as compared to the later evening and night time and here i am referring to people that are not doing night shifts but if you are requesting a number of how much fluid to drink independent of our needs for fluid for exercise that is going to be eight ounces of fluid or two hundred and forty mill leaders of fluid on average for every hour from the time when we wake up until ten hours later that is the simple formulation that should basically insure that you are getting sufficient base line hydration for the cells and tissues of your body now if you are engaging in exercise whether not's endurance exercise or whether not its resistance training exercise you are going to need additional fluids in order to maximize the effects of that exercise and to avoid dehydration and there to we have some excellent numbers that we can look to excellent because they arrive from research and this is largely peeled from the episode that i did with doctor andy galpin professor of connesiology it callstate florton we just six episode series all about exercise everything from straing training ar percufeat endurance nutrician supplementation recovery everything relat to exercise can find all of that at huberman labed out com and one of the components of those episodes that was discuss but that some of you may have not heard is that there is a simple formula for how much fluid to injest on average keepin mon this is on average when you are exercising and i refer to this as the called galpin equation the galpin equation states that you should take your body weight in pounds divide that by thirty and that will give you the number of ounces of fluid to injest every fifteen to twenty minutes on average while exerciseing your body weight in pounds divided by thirty equals the number of ounces of fluid to consume on average every fifteen to twenty minutes when i s on average what i mean is it is not the case that you need to stop every fifteen or twenty minutes and consume that of volume a fluid you could sip it from moment to moment you could waigt half an hour or an hour and then consume a larger bollists of fluid a larger amount although it is recommended for performance sake that you sip or consume beverageis fairly consistently throughout your training one's ability to do that is going to depend on a number of things gastric emptying time whether not the particular exercise your doing whether non it is running or jumping is compatible with injesting fluid on a regular basis or whether not you need to do it at different intervals than every fifteen twenty minutes may be its every five minutes may be its every half hour you have to adjust for you but if you were to take the hour of exercise or the half hour of exercise or the three hours of exercise and ask how much fluid to injust it is going to be that galopin equation of bodywein pounds to byde by thirty equals the number of ounces for every fifteen or twenty minutes and of course i can already here screaming from the back what about for those of us who follow the metric system and there there is a simple translation of the galopin equation which is that you need a proximately two milla leaders of water perkilegram of body weight every fifteen to twenty minutes again the galpin equation converted into the metric system is going to be two millliers of water perkilegram of bodyweight every fifteen to twenty minutes on average i'm sure number of you are asking wheather or not hydration prior to exercise is also impording it absolutely is and if you follow the numbers that i talked about before proximately eight ounces or two hundred and forty mill leaders a fluid in take per hour in the first ten hours of waking that should establish a good base line of hydration heading into exercise which then prompts the next question i often get which is is the amount of water that needs to be consumed according to the galpin equation during exercise on top of or separate from t that is does it replace the amount of fluid that one needs at a basic level that eight ounces are two hunder forty milliars and there the answer sort of goes both ways i think if you are going to exercise then obviously follow the galopin equation in some way again you do not need to be ultra specific about this these are bulpark figures that will in sure hydration we have set them a little bit higher perhaps the needed to insure more hydration rather rather than less but basically the short answer is if you are exercising for about an hour mostpular exercising for an hour or two probably not more than that most of my a work outs are certainly the resistent training work outs last a bout an hour will then you can replace the eight ounces or the two hundred and forty milliars water that is required at baseline with what you consume according to the galpan equation during that baut of exercise a common question is if you are exercising in a heated environment indoor outdoor or you are somebody who tends to sweat a lot and by the way we can all get better at sweating by sweating more sweat is an adaptation you sit in the sanamore you are gingto get better at sweating if you exercise more sputch if you wear more layers or if you do it in hotter temperatures or more human temperatures you are going t get better at sweating over time and sweating is an adaptation that helps cool your body if you are sweating a lot are your in heat how much fluid should you injest in general i think it safe to say that you may want to increase the values on the galpin oquation by about fifty to a hundred per cent either increased by fifty per cent or double those numbers if you 'are in a very hot environment or sweating and awful lot if you are sitting in the sana i highly recommend consuming at least eight ounces and probably more sixteen ounces a fluid that translates again to about two hundred forty yoar about four hundred an eighty lis just round up five hundred mill leaders of fluid for every t onty to thirty minutes that you are in a hot sana and then of course people ask well how hot and it ok that starts getting really detaile than we cannot distinguish between drysonas an wetsanas and again too many variables but i would double your fluid intake for that hot environment exercise or for that hot environment saunas it a also if you are feeling dehydrated ihev what is feeling dehydraded mean hatachi has a a definition that we can get into a lobit layr it will really talking about here is if you are feeling as if your throat is dry you are cording c parched or you are very thirsty well then there is absoluet no problem with injesting more fluids of sixteen ounces of fluit or five hundred milliers of fluid per hour while you are feeling parch my read of the literature is that thirst is a reasonable guide for when we tend to be dehydrated however it is the case that our thirst does not really keep up with our bodies level of dehydration and we know that based on some really nice studies that have explored the amount of fluid intake compared to the amount of yourination compared to the amount of physical output compared to the environment that one happens to be in these are a sort of older studies in the realm of physiology but here is the basic rule of thumb that s can a work for most people if you are feeling parched consume fluids ideally you consume fluids that do not contain caffine or other diretics diretics being a substanceis that cause the release the urnation of fluid from the body ind or if you are consuming caffine either prior to or after bouts of exercise or even just at work or you work in a air conditioned or otherwise dry cool or hot environment that you try and include some sodium and ideally sodiun potassiu manesing the electrolits in that beverage to to be a little pinch of sea salt with some lemon to just the taste o little bit it could be an electrolite drink element or some other sort therera lot of different types out there for most people drinking pure water and i realize that many people do just the taste of pure water chances are youre going to have enough electrolits unless you are sweating quite a bit areyour exerciseing quy lot and under conditions were you are consuming a very few carbohydrates you are going to street more fluid if you are injesting caffine the nots from te or coffee i highly recommend increasing your non caffine fluid in take about twoto wan for every volume of cafine in other words if you have six ounces ar eight ounces of coffee you are ging to want twelve to sixten ounces of fluid ideally fluid with electrolytes or a little pinch of salt in order to offset that dehydration hopely those will provide good rules of thumb for what people want to do when thei're just moving about their day again underscored by the fact that even slight levels of dehydration can really impair our cogniv and physical performance largely by creating fatigue but more often than not by creating brainfog aw i get many questions about brainfog why do i have brainfog when i have brainfog there is a vast literature showing that quality hydration meaning hydration that matches the demands of humidity an output as described in the acquations be that we went over a little bit before really can enhance clarity of focus in over all energy will talk about why that is but i'll just alude to it aa little but here the reason why injesting sufficient fluids cand enhance our ability to focus and in fact can reduce brainfog and can increase physical vigor in output is not mysterious to us we know that there are two mechanisms by which fluid in take triggers elevated levels of alertness and it all has to do with the called sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system which is a real mouthful but basily the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system as many of ou heard me talk about before is the aspect of your nervous system that makes you more alert has nothingto do with emotional sympathy has to do with a bunch of nurons in the middle vyour sfinal cort call the sympathetic chain ganglia and some other related neral networks in your body as well as regions of your brain the locust serulius that release things apinefron and nor uponefernt and make you more alert and in a kind of magnificent arrangement wore i think magnificent arrangement when we have fluid in our got and when our cells are well hydrated and believe it or not when our blatter contains fluid within it there is an elevation in activity of the sympathetic nervous system by way of two pathways one is mecanical in fact we have called stretch receptors in our blatter and in our gut these stretch resceptors have fancy names t rp trip channels as they'are called or piezo which are these stretch sensing a channels this is the beautiful work of many laboratories but in particular a david julias and ar dom patipuchan a devijulisis at you see san francisco ar dem is that the scripts institute a they have discovered a bunch of channels in cells that sense things from cold to on different mechanical pressure influding expansion of tissues a caled mechano sensation and basily what it all boils down to is that when our blatter has some fluid in it when our stomach has some fluid in it and when our cells are sufficiently hydrated they send information about the mechanical presents of that distension even and i hear i'm not talking abo t being overly fuller you full chako block full of fluid are your blatter feeling itreally really fol will talk about that in moment but when we are sufficiently hydrate threis a mechanical signature of that which is the expansion of our tissues cause it has more fluid in it and there are chemical signals as well which is the movement of water across those ocoporn channels is actually understood and a biological level by our cells and sends information to the areas of the brain that are associated with called sympathetic oralsa and makes us more alert this is actually what wakes us up in the middle of the night if we have consume too much fluid prior to sleep and we need o earn it we wake up this is a mechanism that is not adequately developed in babies and young children this is why babies young children often will wet their bed and believe are not both humans and in dogs our ability to control yeur ination voluntarily is something that we actually learn babies just pe in their diper dogs just pe on the floor until their house broken or until the child learns to hold on to their yearn until they go to the bathroom in a bathroom or particularly appropriate location a outdoors ore otherwise the point is that hydration of the body is signal to the brain when we have enough fluid in the tissues of our body when we consumed enough fluid even if it has not already arrived to the cells and tissues of our body that is signal to the brain in the form of alertness and that alertness is what translates to the enhance cognitive abilities that we have when we are well hydrated it is also what translates to our enhanced physical abilities when we are challenged with physical task when look out on the landscape of all these studies that have shown in pairments and physical or cognive performance under conditions of even slight dehydration that all make sense because our cells need fluid we need water but it also prompts the question of well does being well hydrated actually make our brain and body function better in the contects of physical and cognant performance and indeed the answer is yes now earlier we were talking about these equasions that you can apply and again i really want emphasize that these equations were not meant to be followed down to the decimal point they were really meant and are meant as crude but sufficient guides for you to make sure tht youre getting enough hydration depending on your levels of activity and at rest if you recall when we talked about those equasions i said you need about eight ounces or two hundred forty mill leaders of fluid per hour for the first ten hours of your day after waking now why donst thay for the first ten hours well it turns out that the filtration of fluids from your body which is accomplished of course by your kidneys and by way of your blatter and the excretion of fluid out your rethra called yourination is strongly strongly circadean dependent meaning the cells of your kidney and the cells even of your got in fact all the cells of your body but especially the cells of your kidney which filter the fluid that comes in to your body and that make certain hormones theso pressin which is anti diretic hormum all of that functioning of the kidney is under strong regulation by called circadian clock genes circating clockgines are genes that express in every cell but that in certain cells of the body very strongly impact whether not that organ in this case the kidney is going to be activated meaning functioning at a very high level or at a reduced level nd we can make all of this very simple by simply stating what is contained in this beautiful review that i'll provide a link to if you on learn more calld circatean rhythms in the kidney and basicly what is known is that for the first ten hours after waking your kidney is filtering fluid within your body at a very rapid rate their number of different cell types that do that but they are basely taking that fluid pulling out any i'm contaminance yousing hormones such as antidiretic ormon is oppressin to ut just whether ot you'egoingto hold on to fluid or release more fluid from your body in the form of urine depending on i the salt concentration depending on how much fluid you need your work out put the conditions you are in all of that however at about ten hours after waking your kidney really starts to reduce its over all level of functioning now that does not mean that your kidney cannot filter fluid eleven or twelve or sixteen hours after waking but it becomes far less efficient at doing and thank goodness it does because you do not want your kidney filtering fluid at the same rate at midnight assume you wake up at sit seven or eight or nine a m that it was filtering fluid at ten a m in fact we can say that if you want to reduce your night time waking in order to urinate which is a common common question and concern that many people have how can i avoid waking up in th miliniht urinate and there i say it is perfectly normal to witcup once maybe twice each night to urinate but if you want to reduce the number of times that you wake up in order to urinate across the night maybe ven make that number is urotimes you will greatly benefit by doing three things first of all make sure that your hydrating sufficiently during the day time pur the equations that we talked about earlier that will insure that you are not excessively thirsty in the evening and therefore consuming a lot more fluid second and related to that first point is that you do want to reduce your fluid and take at night provided you hydrated sufficiently throughout the day and believe it or not the rate at which fluid moves from your gut and into the cells and tissues of your body and then from your blatter into urine is determined not just by the volume of fluid you injest but also the rate at which you injest that fluid and you might be thinking that is crazy that makes no sense at all right if i drink a tonof fluid slowly does not it still mean that i 'm going to urinate a time yes and no also stands to reason that you might ask if i injust very little fluid but i do it very fast is it going to be the case that i'm going to urinate it out very quickly well yes and no the point is that the fluid filtration systems of your body that range from the gut to the blatter and include the kidney of course depend not just on the volume but on the rate of fluid that you injest because of those mechanic censers that we talked about earlier if you gulp down a bunch of fluids you are going to exscreat those fluids more quickly than if you slip sip them slowly scuse me sip them slowly here is what i recommend throughout the day when you are trying to get your adequate yield of water or other beverages feel free to gulp that fluid or sipit i'm a gulper not a sipper but many of you are going to be sippers not gulpers consume fluid at the rate that feels right to you but feel comfortable gulping that fluid however in the evening if you are somebody who has challenges with waking up excessively in themiddle the night reduce your fluid intake provided you have hydrade properly throughout the day and i suggest consuming no more than five may be eight ounces of fluid between the time of ten hours after waking and when you go to sleep again if you are very thirsty are you under hydraterds very hot feel free to injest more fluid please but most people will find that if they reduce their fluid intake to about five ounces or less of fluid in that later part of the day after ten hours of having woken up and before sleep and they sip those beverages as suppose to gulping them that they will have fewer bouts of waking up in themill the night to go to the restrum and idealy zero let us talk about tap water and here i have to take a deep breath not a deep gulp but a deep breath because in researching tap water and what is contained in tap water in different regions not just in the us but around the world i confess the picture is a pretty scary one i want to be clear i'm not somebody who naturally orients towards fear or conspiracy theories however in researching tap water for this episode by way of looking at the pure reviewed research metanalsies or views specific research articles where specific hypotheses were tested and in talking with experts intoxycology and on it is a pretty grim picture frankly when one looks that what is contained in most tap water and weather not the compounds that are contained in tap water are present in sufficient concentrations to negatively impact our health and the bad news is that much if not all tap water leave ore not much if not all tap water contains things that are bad for the biology of ourselves there is a silver lining however and the silver lining is that very simple steps that are very inexpensive can be used to a just that tap water to make it not just safe to drink but that makes it perfectly fine to drink that is the goo news and will get to that in moment if you are somebody who is interested in weather not tap water contains things endigran destruptors hormone destruptors that can negatively im pact reproductive ealth in males are females re both s a wonderful review wonderful because it thorough although the news is in great it is very thorough which is great which is entitled endicran destruptors and water and their effects on the reproductive system this is a review from twenty twenty that analyzes water from a bunch of different sources within the world and essentially focuses on a few k components first of all if focuses on the concentration of minerals that is magnesium and calcium within water many people do not realize this but called hard water sounds terrible right but hard water is water that contains magnesium and calcium which turns out to be a good thing some water contains more magnsium and calcium other water contains less they looked at the presents of magnesium and calcium because that is going to impact the p h of water in general the higher concentrations of magnesium and calcium and water the higher the p h that is the more alkaline that water is and the lower levels of magnesium and calcium the more acitic or lower p h that water tends to be the other thing that this review addresses is the concentration of called d b ps dog bulldog porcupines d b ps which are disinfection by products contained in water obviously local governments the government wants your drinking water to b clean they do not want contaminins they do not want seage in that water they do not want chemical contaminants that are going to make people immediately sic they treat water water treatment plants treat water with disinfection products and those disinfection products create things called disinfection by producs and the presence of those d b ps are disdisinfectant by products can strongly impact the p h of water by way of changing the concentrations of magnesium and calcium put differently i do believe that governments are trying to provide people with clean water but in doing oftentimes will introduce things to that water that are not good for us now it is very clear that d b ps can cause endigran destruption in ways that are not good for reproductive health i did a very long fact four and half hour episode on fertilitium vitalty that was male anfemale fertility by the way and vitality a that again you confined a huberman lagedot com that talks about all the biological processes involved in the generation of halthy eggs and spurman and creating a healthy embryos in plantation embryos and forth it is very clear that d b pes have been shown to destrupt ovarian functions formatogenesis and fertility outcomes even at concentrations of d b ps that are present in drinking water that comes from the tap now does that mean that you should not drink tap water welt the answer to that is a it depends what is it depend on will depends on several things first of all i highly recommend that everybody go on l ine and put in your zip code and ask for a water analysis of water that comes out of the tap in that zip code this is something that is readily available on line at least to my knowledge and on fortionately there is no specific one site that i can send everyone to to get an indepth analysis of the drinking water that comes out of your tap however i highly recommend that you go on line and put in your zip code or municipal area code and figure out weathe or not your water contains ex amount of deb peas or wyamount of db ps now of course you can to get a bunch of values back and unless ouratoxycologist probably not can o know what those values mean but what youre really looking for is weather or not there are high low or moderate levels of floride in that drinking water why do i say that well there ore studies that showde that the concentration of floride in drinking water is of particular concern for the fieroid harmone system of the body now fieroid hormone has lotted frem rolls in brain and body and fieroid hormone is very important for everything from metabolism to levels of energy when thieroi levels are deserrupted or thiroid receptors are deserrupted it can lead to depression when thieroid hormones are optimized it can lead to optimol mood if there is such a thing but in other words it helps keep your mood elevated it relates t everything from sleep to re production thieroid harmon is avolved in many manythings including bone health and tissue health generally it such aay every biological proces in your body is impacted by fieroid hormon and there is a study that i' d to highlight which has publish in twenty eighteen and the tell of the study is impact of drinking water floride on human fieroid harmones this was a case control study this is not an extensive analysis of many individuals however what it shows is that floride negatively impacts fieroid stimulating hormone and call te three levels you have fieroid harmon te three and te for even in the standard concentrations that are present of and heres an importatnumber zero point five miligrams perleader ocaso if you can get a hold of the floride concentrations in your tap water and find out whether or not the concentrations are at below or exceed zero point five melegrams perleader what you will find is that even just zero point five melegrams perleader of water can disrupt fieroid function and this is going to be of particular concern for people to have femilial genatically related fieroid issues or that are concerned with keeping your fieroid harmone levels healthy which i think its everybody i am telling you that you should try and get to hold of some data about the water that comes out of your tap if you intend on drinking tap water and probably even if you do not just know wit is in your drinking water your local government should provide that information and ort should be readily available on line and in particular i think it is worth while to address how much floride is present in your drinking water againd i do not want to create lot of scare i'm not trying to trigger fear here i do think however by way of reading this review by way of reading the paper that i just refer to a moment ago gan links to these are gon to be provide in the shownote captions that there is extensive evidence that elevated levels of floride in drinking water are simply not good for us now that could open a whole discussion of wife floride is in our drinking water in the first place at all but leaving that aside it seems to me that most everybody should know how much flord is in their drinking water and ideally everybody yes everybody is filtering their drinking water now that raises the question of how best to filter drinking water and that brings an answer of it depends on a couple of things first of all how healthy or unhealthy do yourself to be if you are somebody who has no health issues you plenty of vigor your sleeping well at nights yi've i'm no autoomune disease you are not aware of any a health concern minor major will then perhaps you are somebody that does not wnt a filter your water i would argoue that why woouden to you employ some very low or even zero cost approach to filtering your water there are going to be other individuals who are suffering particular ailments of brain or body or both that absolutely should be filtering their drinking water if they are getting theire drinking the water from their tap because is pretty well establishd now that tap water contains a lot of these disinfect ind by products as well as in most cases exceeding the threshold of floride that we know to be healthy for us how should you filter your tap water well you have everything ranging from called brida type filters to thse you be carbon type filters or other filters that a you ssintially put over a container or compartment we could pour the water over it goes into the compartment below will those work are they sufficient to filter out the disinfect in by products the general answer is yes provided you change the filters often enough however it is not thought unfortunately not thought that they filter out sufficient floride would i highly recommend is depending on your budget that you go on line and you search for at home water filters that can filter out floride there are number of straight forward and inexpensive tools to do that and here i do not have any relationship to any of the water filters or things that im t to mension now when be very clear about that there is no a brandcot or af filiation here a i'm simply trying to direct you to resources that will allow you to filter your tap water for it to be more safe for you to consume in a way that meets your budget with the understanding that people have very different disposable incomes the range of cost here is going to be prettye tremendous i dust want to get that out of the way first there are water filters that you can use repeatedly these are what i'll refer to ats pitcher filters that are less than a hundred dollars now keep in mind that that is at one time purchase except for the a replacement of the filters which fortunately does not have to be done too often there are different filters i'll provide a link to one that i found that is at least by my read of the lowest possible cost of this is the call clearly filtered water pitcher with a finity filtration this is a filter that can adequately remove floride lead be p as gliphosates hormones and some of the other harmful things that are contained in most top water again i do realize and for some people even an eighty you estollar coste is going to be prohibitive but do realize that what you are doing here is youre purchasing a unit that can be use repeatedly over and over a the reason why it is lower cost than some of the different filtration approaches they will talk about a moment are that you cannot really put all the drinking water that would use say for an entire weak or for a tire month a in one pitchure youre going t have to a repeatedly pour water am into a the pitcher in order to filter it now as a macthon before the range on water filter costs for filters that can adequately remove floride and all the other things that ou want out of your top water is immense vat you can fined a in a whole house water filters that are you two thousand dollars or more again these are can be filters that are can be n your garrage or in a a laundry room that are going to basely pull from the the a piping system of your house and deliver a purified water technicall it is not purified but that is removing these contaminants and floride from all the sints in your house you culd effectively drink from any or all things in your house that is what explains the hirer cost i think most people are probably not going to have the disposable income or have the opportunity to a include one of these wholl house filters although if you a do have the means and it is important to you could do that and then there are going to be what i would call intermediate system systems that cost somewhere between two hundred and five hundred dollars a ly one of the wore a common ones or a popular ones is alled berkey filter system these are filter systems that again remove the things that you want removed from your top water and they can do it at higher volumes and their typically counter top units a they do not require any plug in typically or they only require brief plug in and electricity in they aregong to filter out many many leaders are tens ofe leaders of water that you can always have access to that clean filtered water at any time or day or night without having to pour over into the pitcher i mention these different options because th again i realize that people have different levels of disposable income as far as i know there is no taplet or simple mechanism that can be purchased as a transportable a pill that you can just simply throwin water and remove the contaminants if any one is aware of one that can adequately remove floride and other contaminants please up put in in the commen section on you to that be the best place am that i and every one else can see it but wholfully the mention of the different filtration systems hi mentioned am will give you some choices that i would hope would fall within the range that a one cold potentially afford an important note about filtration just as in our body there are mechanisms to signal mechanical changes and chemical changes that occur in ore got in our brain et cetera elsewhere and in general both mechanical and chemical changes are signaled across the body to invoke different changes whether or not those are i responsof the mian system ore to make us more alert or more sleep et cetera too filtration capitalize as on mechanical and chemical filtration what i mean by that is when you run a fluid water or any other fluid through a filter those filters are doing two things they are physically constraining which molecules can go through by creating portals pours that allow certain size molecules to go through and not others and almost always they contain certain chemicals themselves those filters have ben treaty with certain chemicals that neutralize certain other chemicals you may be wondering how when you filter water manesum in calcium can get through but floride does 't and that is because these filters have been very cleverly designed in order to neutralize floride or to prevent large molecule such as sediment and dirt which is kind of easy to imagine being filtered but also to allow certain small molecules calcium which is small ish or magnesium which is smallish to still pass through intar drinking wate and this is wonderful because what it means is that by filtering our water using any of the methods that we talked about before you are still going to get whatever magnesium in calcium was present in that water while still adequately removing the floride and other disinfectin by products now what if you cannot afford any of those options can well here you have an interesting zero costoption it is not as good as the other ones of filtering that water but it is an option and i do think it is important to give options to people who do not have any disposable income for the purpose of filtering their water which is to draw a gallon or five gallons or maybe even more tap water out of the tap and put it into some some container some vessel con be one gallanfhive gallontan gallon container and then to let that tap water sit for some period of time to allow some of the sediment to drop to the bottom now you might say wellthere is no sediment there is nothing contained in that a tap water and it is not floride diluted in the water and indeed the answer to that is yes however there is some evidence that letting tap water sit out at room temperature and outside the pipes that deliver that water can help remove some not all of the contaminants in that water if however you are filtering the water using any of the methods that i talked about a few moments ago you do not need to do this i realize there is a hol whirled out there of people who in sist on putting their water in the sun or only keeping it and certain containers and putting it out for few days before they conjest it that to me seems a bit extreme if ou want to do that be my guest but i do not think most people need to do that however i do believe that for people who have zero disposable income to devote to pang for any kind of filtration system for their tap water thet taking that tap water in putting into some container at room temperature and keeping it room temperature for a half day or a day or more and then pouring off the top to th irds of that water into another container and consuming the water from that second container is going to remove som not all of the contaminants that one would need to be concerned about and here i should mention something that i'e neglected to mention a few moments ago if you are going to do this a zero costoption and and let the water sit out for bit you would want that water to sit uncapped sorry i should have mention that before uncapped of course trying to keep things from falling into that water in fact you could even put a am a little bit of cloth above it you do not want things falling into that water but you want certain things to be able to evaporate off and you also want some f the sediment to drop down and the reason why this process of letting water s it out would work at all is because many of the contaminants containd within water are not present because of the source of that water or even the treatment of that water but rather because of the pipes of that water arives to your glass or y the pot that you have from can here again there is infinite number of variables some people are living in buildings for which the pipes are very very old but very very clean believe it or not some people are living in newer buildings in structures that have new pipes but for which the seals between those pipes contain things that are not good for you to consume by letting water sit out for while you are able to remove someof the contaminants present within the pipes of your home and the building and even the ipes that lead to your home or apartment some people get really obsessd with the soltap water thing and really want to find out all the details about the pipes and what sorts of y hard medals and how much magnesium and how much calcium ar present in their water there areways that ou contest our drinking water for those sorts of things most people i realize including myself are simply not going to do that a if you want to know what i do i tend to drink water that is filtered through one of these lower cost filters or if i am going to be consuming a lot of fluid i will drink am certain kinds of fluid that later i'll tell you am i've been doing an experiment for sake of this episode looking it called molecular hydrogen water which sounds very fancy and asoteric and almost am the wacky but it turns out a has largely to do with the amount of magnsium and calcium and the p h of that water if you are somebody yo has a very low by get or simply just wants to spend a very small amount of money and tring still drink tap water there is absolutely away to do that safely but it does require a few of these steps on the topic of magnesium and calcium this relates as i mentiond earlier to the quoticot hardness of water what of the hardness of water is it better to have more magnesium in calcium in your water or less some people do not the taste of hard water they prefer the taste of water that has less magnesium an calcium however there i would encourage you to take a step back and consider some of the literature in fact i'll mention a paper in particular now publishin twenty nineteen which describes the quote regulations for calcium magnesium or hardness in drinking water in the european union member states turns out in europe they do very detailed wall water an alcis and that is presen to number of realy hiqualities of scientific publications this was a paper published in regulatory tocsycology in farmicology and they sight a number of different references in the introduction that for instance and here i'm a'm quoting statistically significant inverse association between magnesium and cartiovascular mortality now agen that is it an association this is not causal but higher magnesium in water lower cartyovascular mortality they go on to say the highest exposure category which oure people consuming drinking water with magnesium contents of eight point three to nineteen point for miligrams perleader again when you get your water and alcis you can an compare again some of these values was significantly associate with decrease likelihood of cardiovascular mortality by twenty five per cent compared with people consuming magnesium content of to wh point five to eight point to miligrams perleader what this basically shows an and by the way the reference to that of all also provide linktoin the shownoe caption what this basially states is that higher magnesium containing water and it turns out higher magnesium and calcium an containing water called harder water may not taste as good to you but turns out to be better for you now whether not it can prevent you from getting cartyovascular disease i do not know in fact i probably just state no ith probably will not prevent you from carty ofascular diseasies still need to do all the other things thar im portant for avoiding cartyovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease a for that and what to do in order to avoid cartyovascular disease i strongly encourage you to listen to the episode with doctor peteratia that is coming out in a few weeks that gets deep into that topic and the actionable items for avoiding cartyovascular disease but basically as this study quotes there is a growing concensis imom epidemiologists and epidemiological evidence along with clinical and nutricial evidence that is strong enough to suggest that new guidance should be issued in terms of how these different sources of tap water should enhance not to pleat the amount of magnesium an calcium in that water now this ought to raise a very important question in all of your minds which is why is it that magnesium and calcium concentrations are relevant to cartyofvascular disease is it something about what magnesium does in cells are what calcium does in cells are we all magnesium and calcium deficient well it turns out that is not the case the major effact by which magnesium an calcium in water are likely to impact things blood pressure cartyofvascular disease and other aspects of cellar function turn out to be somewhat cryptic but we can make that cryptic aspect very clear by saying that when we have more magnesium in particular but also calcium present in our water socal hard water you increase the amount of hydrogen in that water becomes what we call hydrogen rich and the piache of that water is increased now again this does not mean that we are trying to change the pih of the cells of our body in any kind of meaningful way in fact we do not want to do that we want the ph of the cells of our boty to stay in particular ranges i mention earlier but having more magnesium and more calcium in our water that is increasing the hardness of our water changes the p h of that water and it turns out that the elevated p h of water that is p h of water that tends to be somewhere between hig sevens be caus a seven point nine up to even nine or nine point to is going to be more readily absorbed and is going to more favorably impact the function of ourselves than lower p h water gen i want a restate this because i'm a littlebut concerned that a maybe eclip of this as can be taken and and send elsewhere and 'm some one will get the impression that i'm saying that we actually want to drink high p h water that we all need to buy expensive high p h ware turns out that is not the case if you are consuming tap water from a location where levels of a magnesium are sufficiently high in that tap water again where the level magnesium is eight point three to nineteen point for miligrams per leader of water that is if the water coming out of your tap is hard enough will then chances are you do not need to enhance the p h of thap water change its magnesium concentration if however the water that your drinking from the tap filtered or not i would hope filtered contains less than eight point three miligrams per leader of magnesium well then chances are the p h of that water is going to be low enough that it is not going to be lending itself to some of the favorable health components that higher ph water can notice i did not say that lower p h h a more ascitic water is bad for you i did not say that i said that higher p h water can be good for you thet's talk about how and why higher p h water can be good for you and some of the best and in fact very inexpensive sources of higher p h magnesium enhanced or simply tap water that contains sufficient magnesium can be used and access many of you are probably wondering whether or not you can simply boil your tap water and thereby d contaminate the tap water there i want to caution you it turns out that some of the contaminants present in water are actually made worse by heating water and again i do not want o open up a in ahull a catalogue of different fears i all of you i presume use water to cook poster rise because i'm an ominabore do consume those things i confess if i make your bomate or any kind of t or coffee i tend to use a higher quality water source a than tap water even if that top water is filtered because i the taste far more if i use a really good source of water and again becaus i'm not consuming those beverages in enormous volumes that becomes a a relatively inexpensive endevor but i would caution people against using boiling or heating of water as the only method to d contaminate their tap water and instead to also rely on some of the filtration system s that i talked about before and as longas were talking about the temperature of water there is or of an on going debate on line not a huge debate but a number of people engage in this debate as to whether not drinking really cold water or room temperature water is better for you or worse for you this is a tough one to resolve it turns out that if water is very very cold that is if you drink it and you can feel that cold water making its way down to youare gut and you can actally feel it is cold within your gut that sort of a i u back of the envelope ai should say a direct within the gut measure of a cold verse's body temperature water that it is going to be slower to absorb that is youre gin to feel it slashing around in your stomach for a bit longer then if you were to consume water that is slightly warmer now that is not to say that you should injest warm water or room temperature water however many people find that when they drink very cold water or ice water that indeed it can alter the cind of a sensation of the lining of their stomach in ways that at least to them feel the altering their digestion and that make sense the sells that line the gut are very temperature sensitive you want this un for a number reasons including not consuming food that is excessively hot or cold or damaging your gut but in general most people know the temperature fluid that they want to injest and injest that temperature of fluid most people for instenc on a cold day want a warmer hot fluid does that mean that you are not going to absorb that warmer hot fluet now of course it does not you are going to absorb that fluid one way or the other drink fluids at the temperatures that are to your liking in that moment inother wrds what you desire in that moment and do not worry much about trying to avoid cold reverage is or trying to make sure that youare always consuming room temperature water is supposed to coled water now with your understanding of hard water soft water magnesium the relationship between magnesium calcium in the p h of water and remember our earlier conversation wher we talked about how higher p h water is actually going to move out of the gt and into the body a bit more readily and across those ocoporin channels more readily than lower p h more acitic water well hat raises the question of whether not all these different forms of water that are out there reverse osmosis water distilled water double distilled water a detirium to pleaded water alka line water as it is often called whether or not any or all of that has meaningful halth outcomes here we can address some of those items pretty quickly for instance distilled water and double distilled water is essentially distilled of that is it has magnesium and calcium removed from it my recommendation would be to not drink distilled water there may be specific circumstances where somebody has very high levels of blood magnesium or calcium or calcium stores within the body that would necessitate them drinking only distilled water but that seems a very isolated nav niche case in general consuming distilled water is just simply not necessary now in terms of reverse osmosis water what is reverse osmosis water reverse osmosis water is water that has been passed repeatedly through a series of filters that are designed to remove the kinds of contaminents we re talking about earlier some of the basic contaminants disinfect in by products floride and some other large and small molecules that leaves the water ideally still containing magnesium and calcium although there some evidence that reverse osmosis water can deprive water of some of the magnesium an calcium if you are going to use reverse osmosis philters and drink u reverse osmosis water you want to make sure that you are still getting the magnesium concentrations present in that water that we talked about earlier but in general reverse osmosis water is considered safe but and for many people this is going to be an important but but very expensive to access the reverse osmosis filters require lot of changing on the philters purchasing reverse osmosis water in its a stable form within a containers these are topically last containers is going to be pretty expensive an prohibitive for most people that said there are number of people out there that really the taste of reverse osmosis water they report it as feeling more smooth a they think of reverse osmosis water as quotin giving them energy to be quite onest there is no direct studies of the subjective sensation of water in the mouth and in the gut and it is relative health effects again the smoothness of water as one drinks it and goes down a the gut i really has no direct relationship to the quoting hardness or sophmis of water i know that is going o shock a number of you you prly think hard waters can be hard to drink and it turns out that is not the case in fact many people find that with elevated levels of magnesium and calcum and water it actually taste a smoother or softer in their mouth hard water tastes smooth or soft i know it is all very on counter intuitive but i think it is important to point this out because a number of times you will here or read about filtering water that taste smoother and better and oftentimes that is happening because the quoting hardness of water that is the concentrations of magnesium an calcium are actually increasing if you are somebody is curious about reverse osmosis water and you can afford the philters or the reverse osmosis water already prefiltered a please be my guest ' drink it i am certainly not trying to prevent anyone from drinking it but there is no pure reviewed evidence that i am aware of that conclusively shows that drinking reverse omosis water is far better for us than drinking other types of water provided the other types of water are adequately filter to floride and the sorts of disabfected by product that we talked about earlier what about hydrogen water you may have heard of this or hydrogen enriched water or electrolize reduced water as ay way to access hydrogen inriche water all this might sound pretty crazy to some of you now fortunately forsake of to day's discussion we can take a number of different categories of let us call it unique categories of water that have been described including detyrium to pleaded water and by the way detyrium is something that relates to the presence of hydrogen ions in water and put very simply water that is extracted from sources that are closer to sea level tend to have more detyrium in them than water that is extracted from sources further from sea level up in the mountains for instance and from springs further away from oceans as yet closer sea level the sources of water separate from sea water tend to have more detyrium which relates to the in richment or lack of hydrogen within that water or free hydrogen within that water i warn'd you this was all gan sound pretty nech and that we are goin to get a lobet into the chemistry banomeno make it all very simple for you at least for the nonofycianater electrolized reduced water which is a method of using electricity to alter the a confirmation of the water molecules and their rates of movement as well as well as called hydrogen rich water or hydrogen inriched water or detyrium to pleaded water all have the property of having higher levels of p h than other forms of water such as distilled water reverse osmoses water and generally hygher p h than the kind of water that comes out of your tap unless you live in a region where your tap water has very high levels of magnesium in it which does occur in certain regions of the world but is not that common more typically the water that comes out of your tap does not have enough magnesium meaning not as much magnesium in it as you would and this i believe explains in a fairly straightforward way why there is suchen of peel of these p hen hance or alculine waters or electrolize reduce water or detyrium te pleaded water the couple of reasons but first of all any time some one is consuming a specialized form of water chances are it is going to be filtered of the disinfectan by products floride and the other things that you really do not want o water already the water is going to be cleaner than would be coming out of the tap that is going to indirectly explain a number of the called health benefits both subjective and perhaps even objective as will talk about that can result from consuming these other a let us ay more esoteric of forms of water at least not of simple tap water however if you look at hydrogen or hydrogen enriched water you really need to take a step back and ask what is that you kow whatare we really talking aboup cause it turns out that you can create hydrogen en riched water by putting tablets of magnesium itself small amounts of magnesium dissolving those in water it will give off a kind of a gashous solution you will se intur bubbling in their you certainly want to a dilute that tablet and thend consume the water and yes it is true what you heard about and read from these commercial sources you do on a consume that water within about five to fifteen minutes after that tablet conpletes dissolving now why would you do this and i should say that i have now a started doing this not because i necessarily think that it is necessary or beneficial talk about my experience in a moment i did it in anticipation of this episode because i was researching water and hydrogen in rich water and all these alkaline waters and what became very clear to me based on reading a fantastic to part review its a very extensive review on entitled atleast the first part is entitled electrolized reduce water molecular hydrogen is the exclusive agent responsible for the theraputic effects and then there is a second part to this rethe zou extensive is entitled electrolize reduce water number to safety concerns and effectiveness as a source of hydrogen water what this review a which we have link to in the shownotes points to is that all of the health benefits of these different forms of water that you hereabout out there detyrium to pleaded hydrogen in rich et cetera all seem to boil down nopon intended no boiling included i should say to the elevation in hydrogen that translates into and here is the really meaningful change the elevation in p h that occurs when you hydrogen in rich water now there are not a lot of clinical studies looking hydrogen in rich water but their starting to be more than a few and one that i to point out and that will link to was a publish fairly recently which is entitled hydrogen rich water reduces n flammatory responses and prevents apitosis apitosis is a naturally occurring cell death during development and is generally used to describe cell death of the body sometimes this can be good sell deth by the way removing cells that need to be removed again the title of the paperis hydrogen rich water reduces in flammatory responses and prevents apitosis of pariferal blood sells in healthy adult erandomize double blind control trial now this paper looked at the effects of drinking one point five leaders per day of hydrogen in rich water for a period of four weeks they did find significan positive benefits of reduced inflammation and they found these changes by way of analyzing things interlucan six and some the other interlucans which are markers of inflammation they control very nicely for the fact that people were still consuming other forms of water and liquid and coffee et ceteralthough they made sure that they were not consuming too much coffee in soda in addition this hydrogen in riched water but what this paper shows is that indeed increasing the free hydrogen in water can im prove certain health matrics in these cells and this is inkeeping with some of the subjective reports that people have stated out there and that i myself experience i have to say that by drinking hydrogen rich water which i'll tellyou hw to do fairly inexpensively in a moment you do get the subjective experience of having more energy of feeling better coden quote now keep in mind of course the plocebo effect is i very real and powerful effects ut could just be plocebo although in this paper they did of course include a plocibo groups of people din'tknow if they were getting hydrogen which rich water or non hydrogen rich water i should also mention that the in provements in healthmetrics that they observed in the study were only observed for individuals older than thirty years old why that is i do not know the conclusions these authors came to in terms of how these individuals older than thirty achieved lower levels rashes that reduce levels of inflammation an improved markyrs of other aspects of biological function is that the hydrogen water improved the biological antioxyden potential of certain celtypes and again the seltypes that they mainly focus on wore these perferal blood cells in this particular study now how could this be why would this be well this goes back to our earlier discussion about reduction in reactive oxygen species caled aroesses and reductions in free raticals that can damage cells if all of this is sounding very convoluded i can understand wy however what ilike about this study and the two reviews that i mention a moment ago is that these studies do not really say that hydrogen rich water is what is essential what these studies really point to is that the changes in p h of water that inhancing the hydrogen in water can create is what lieves to the enhanced either absorption and or ability of cells to utilize that hygher p h water again not by changing the p h of the body or of cells but simply because hygher p h water or we could perhaps more accurately state less acidic water that is harder water that contains more magnesium and calcium seems to be more readily used by the cells of the body and therefore it is very likely that the individuals in this study were achieving higher or more efficient levels of hydration if any of this is confusing let me be very clear ido not believe that we all need to drink deterium to pleaded water or that we all need to drink electrolize reduced water nor do i necessarily believe that we all need to drink hydrogen rich wate however it is very clear to me that all these different forms of water or better absorbed and therefore lhead to better and more efficient hydration and therefore can reduce inflammation blood pressure and improve a number of other health metrics because of the elevated p h that all of these different purification or water treatmen methods achieve and that elevated p h again is not changing the p h of the cells and tissues in organs of your body you actully do not want that rather that elevated p h is simply making the water less acitic than it would be other wise the simple take away is this if your tap water contains sufficient magnesium pur the values that we talked about earlier i do not think you need to hydrogen inricher water i do however suggest that you at least analyze your water or look at some of the professional analysis of water that you can achieve on line and filter out disinfectin by products and florides et cetera from that magnesium whi should say sufficiently magnesium containing water put simply if your tabwater has enough magnesium filter it but drink it and i think you are doing just fine if however the levels of magnesium in your tap water are not above that value tht we talked about earlier in that case i do think and i can completely understand wy inriching the amount of hydrogen in that water can make that water not only more palatable i give you the sensation that it softer or smoother or more enjoyable to drink than more acitic water would be but also that that water is going to be far more effective in being absorbed and hydrating the cells and tissues of your body where turns out to be very important for an enormous range perhaps every biological function within your brain and body how can you hydrogen in rich our water that actually can be done a fairly inexpensively i've een doing that as i mention earlier as part of an experiment in a preparation for this episode because turns out that the water that comes out of my tap has very little magnesium in it and very little calcium as well the way to create hydrogen rich water as you can simply purchase molecular hydrogen tablets which in reality are just magnesium tablets that dissolve in water and create a free hydrogen that can interact with the other water molecules now the chemistry behind it has been substantiated and i'll provide a link in the shownote captions to a paper that gets into some fairly extensive detail about the way that having an additional hydrogen in your water can adjust the flow of electrons and the adjustment of free raticals but keep in mind again this is all through increases in the p h of your water and please keep in mind that you cannot simply take any other or any old magnesium tablets or capsil and put it into water the configuration of the magnesium in these tapsuls and tablets is such that it allows a rapid dissolving of the tablet and the activation of the free hydrogen that can interact with he water molecules again there are only a few scientific studies exploring the real biological effects of these a activated hydrogen waters a the dissolvable tablets are the far less expensive way to go than purchasing a prepackaged and sealed hydrogen water in fact i do not recommend a those brands because they are an quite expensive and it is not clear how stable the activated or free hydrogen is in those waters in any case this is certainly not something that every one needs to do i mention it because i have had a good experience with it myself i also will mention again that i have no on business or affiliation to any of these products i'll provide a link to a few of them in the shownote captions for those of you that want to experiment and indeed that is why iam telling you this for those of you that want to experiment with raising the p h of your water without having to purchase what is ordinarily quite expensive higher p h water you can do this with these dissolvable magnesium tablets my experience with them has been quite good in fact i plan to continue to use them once or twice a day this is not the sort of thing that you need to do in all the water that you drink i want to repeat even if you go down this path and you find that you really the activated hydrogen tablet approach it is not the case that you want to put these in all of your water and you certainly do not want to put them in carbonated waters of any kind that will le to a lodagastrict discomfort nor do you want to put them into hot liquids of any kinds again this is the sort of thing that you do once or twice maybe three times to day and you can find out for yourself and measure subjectively whether or not you the experience n whether not you kotenkot feel better now earlier in the episode we were discussing structured water or this fourth phase of water i know a number of people out there are curious as to whether or not ingesting structured water is somehow better for us then in gesting non structured water all i can say about this is that it is a very contureversial thing to suggest that structured water is somehow more biologically effective or better for us than non structured water there are a number of different ways that one can create structured water i they involve some pretty extensive and exspensive at home systems i arranging anywhere from a couple of hundred dollars to a couple of thousand dollars or more to be quite direct when one goes in to the pure reviewed scientific literature one will not find that is there is essentially no real evidence that ingesting structured water leads to any specific desired biological outcomes as i say that i 'm sure therearepeople out there who have still had a tremendous experiences ingesting structured water whether or not that is due to a plecibo effact or real effect of ingesting structured water is not clear just to give you a sense of what my stansis on things structured water i think that they are interesting and intriguing but as a scientist in the absence of any quality pure viw data at present i cannot really suggest that people go out and start ingesting structured water nor i that they adhere to the claims that structured water is going to be really really good for them compared to other forms of water that said i do think that there is an interesting ind open space for further exploration of the biological effects of structured water given the fact that structured water does exist i do not think any one debates that and the fact that the different structures of water in this fourth phase of water as wore calling it has been shown to interfa s with solids and other aspects of liquids and can do within organells of cells different components of cells that control different functions including matocondria i think there is a patential there whether or not there is a promise there is a another question entirely i do not wan to shut the door on structured water i think this is anopen question that i hope there will be more data to answer those questions in not to distant future and meanwhile if any of your were of good clinical studies exploring the biological effects of structured water in either animal models or humans please put those references in the comments on you to because i'm very curious as to how this area of bological effects of structured water is evolving and continues to evolve to day we discussed water and admittedly we went into a lot of detail about the physics and chemistry of water in its various forms and we talked about hydration because i think that is the main reason why many of you are interested in or concerned about wate else to talked about contaminants in tap water which un fortunately do exist and a very prominent a in essentially all regions of the world please do get some information about what is coming out of your tap il one to throw in one other piece of information that sreally critical that i learned about when researching this episode which is the quality of water that comes out of your tap is not just dictated by the source that it comes from external to your home or apartment your pipes are also important and that filter or that little mash that sits at the fosit head is also very important most people do not pay attention to that but turns out that a lot of debrisan contaminence can be derived from that little filter a that most people just simply are not cleaning often enough here i'm not trying to tell you that the a metal or that plastic that that filter is made of is a problem more often than not contaminants are showing up in water because people are not clean those filters often enough n in fact prior to researching this episode in everthink to clean that filter a i looked underneath my fosid and a while that filter did not look particularly filled with debris i did find that when i took it off and i looked at the other side there was quite a lot of debris if you are going to consurme tap water you defully want ed consider the source the pipes in your building are partment the ones that lead right up to your glass or jug that you would put that water into and also that mesh that that water passes through as it goes into that glass or jug we also talked about how much water to drink i hope that we finally resolve that question for those of you that have been wondering about that the galpan equation is a wonderful approach to how much water to consume during exercise and by providing these other formulas of about eight alnces are two hundred and forty millleaves o water per hour for the ten hours from waking until postwaking on average rememberates averages you non't ave to consume them every hour on the hour no need to be neuraudic a hopefully you can achieve better levels of hydration which we know can lead to reductions in blood pressure improvements in appitite mood and focus and i really think that it is the improvements in cognitive focus and physical ability both endurant strength and other forms of a kind of readiness in the body readiness to perform work in the body that really are best supported by the hydration literature and then of course we went through the different forms of water that you hereabout out there an addressd which ones are going to be beneficial or not and perhaps more importantly why any of them would be beneficial thinking about that from the perspective of biologists and the chemistry of water and i do hope that by arriving at this point in the episode now that you have a much better understanding of the chemistry and physics of water and the way that water can powerfully impact your biology if you are learning from endur enjoying this podcast please subscribed ar you tube channel that is a terrific zero costway to support us

supplements are not necessary for everybody many people derived tremendous benefit from them for things improving sleep supporting hormones improving focus and on he huberman labpodcasts is proud to av partnered with momentous supplements we have done that for several reasons first of all momentous supplements are of the very highest quality and are used if with various sport teams in very studies through the department defense and on and momentou supplements tend to be in single ingredient formulations single ingredient formulations are absolutely essential if you are going to develop the most costeffective and biologically effective supplement regimen for you because simply put they allow you to adjust the dosage of individual ingredients to alternate days that you take different ingredients to sycle them and forth in addition momentous supplements are available internationally which many other supplements are not if you to see the supplements discussed on the huberman lab

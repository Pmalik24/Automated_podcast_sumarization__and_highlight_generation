everybody a speaking to you today from the stage of an opera house at the brook on academy of music in new york city wati te te te thert myop her tingra the hour and the pockas rock an beep tat and i'm here on an operahouse stage with ta story that is small it almost feels wrong to tell it in a room this grand it' i she about a real opera singer not a superfamous oper singer or anyhing that carn gilfry makes about half of her living singing the other hap she makes recording audio book and abody year ago she was staying at a hotel and she had a dead line on this children's book that she wasuposed to be recording in the hotel room was con a noisy she shen ot a noise from the street as sif she will drive her quite placent she went into the closet put pillows all round to dead en the sound sou ond the floor with microphone and then the cord of the microphome i went under the door of the closet op to her lap top cas her lap top had a fan that made noise and she closes the door its pitch dark except for the light from her eye pad which had the text of the bok that she wasupposed to read and she began the exciting exploits of an efirbeszent olf written bitricia sugarette a narrated by carne gilfry chapter one where is emma the enchanted forest was deep and green and splashed with cosyou ait would not be incredible if i just now played you the entire audiobo he paid eighty fide books wor the sea i can play you the hold od your book because karrn gets exactly two and have sentences into this book and she stumbles on word she is i' dil wait out just ou just start again on the start from th beginning she gets up to got o the coset and start the tay agansid recorning again and a she tries to get out closet and she discovers that she is locked in only gan the gont none at first she thought this is not in to be that hard right after all she has the eye pad his wife i she could call the front desk on sky red there was a problem this wife i was half of one bar and it kept just cutting out but i found the hotel number this course is on the recording tointo six six one nin six sers er i doltit o a e hoo o o we eaea ai y o ii a we e aa i and then o course us e longguest hotel fon mann ever o o e a ra y y o a oe o ai ra o anmd chying to press zero to get to the operator and i'm thinking the life is can a cut out at any moment i'm listening ti this giant long manew and finally i hear o a w e aer ray tant o a e be e me i i am actually in room eleven there sex canear me anear me after that the seven minutes of silence on the recording just total silence nothing happens extamt every now and then carn just lagh to herself thapens one minute and forty eight seconds after the found all then it is quiet is no other sound for forty four seconds and then on the recording your here now and then she tries the door handle again thinking she told me lat her this cannot really be true this cannot this got of e with is can a word one wall of th cosit has the hallway on the other side and eighteen minutes after karan locked herself in she hears people she hear some german torists walking towards her down the hall and fortunately she actually has the skills foard this very situation do iii german's come to the door of the room they whispered to each other for a little bid and then they do nothing o her husband is at ona dis shan he is also a singer and his fome as turned off she tects her mam there is nothing back she fowns her mam and right then somebody taps on the dor af the hotel room and calls through it are you oket yeow can you come to the door the person asks io erkaran knows thit is really were thing to say to somebody is yeuvening yescue but she just could and help herself noody wants to look a not apparently the germans when they fond this very sweet to make an housekeeper and twenty two minutes after karan was locked and the housekeeper set her gray god i was happy to see her and she was nice o my gash she was nice i knowtis the werd question but leg is n't appropriate ted tip in a situation that i do not kno i did not think of it then ta karn remember if she sheis nofera singer right and operas are all about spectacle you nowt's eighty peoples on the stage and horses and love d vengeance and big grand feelings it was really it would really be hard to get further from that to what happened to her in that closit right while all the action takes place in a space not much bigger than your body it is the simplest plot imaginable there 's literally no movement in this plot if some one which to stage this as an opera how would that go am it might be minimaliset music actually a ray just a repeating theme over and over and over again with me yelling help thnd if people say this cius of things an interviews and then i'll put that clot at the end of the story and makes her ni sending put a little plunky music under it and maybeyhu heard our shoul but when we did this interview lie three or four weeks ago i reos a wittising i for once in my life i do not have to let this story stop here i am actually going to be in an opera house very soon i can retire with this i can take this to the next logical step the step it never gets tou the step you need an opera house for and it tunt that i actually have a hook up for the kind of music that carran is talking about someb of this i have a cousin his nameis philip glask is written an number of minimalist operas they been performed here oin this very stage since the nineteen eighties ight stand on the beach just this past fall and i called philip and he sat down to write and to day wrigt now i am pleased to present here on the brooken academy of music opera house go cgegold from eear of his latest opera i am not joking this opera is called help commission for our programm to day on the baom opera house stage his worcis played by orchestras all over the world please welcome philip glass acoeeaconcantingigion biawain emily browser n chello and

chicago is this american life distributed by public reatingr international om our glass let his gentlemen for decades the broken academy of music has been a home for all sorts of new kinds of theatre and dance and music and opera and when they invited our programm to beform your day we want to live up to that tou ti sion byke trying to invent something ne and what your infor to day is true stories its journalism we always do represented as radio drama and weading is a readyour jurmas you have never heard before we have journalism turned into opera in to a full on broadway musical we have journalism turnd in to uplay that a structure a radior docke yto mentry fake is there many ways you can tell a true story there are many ways and to day instead of jus uppying the tools of journalism to everyday stories w musually do which ar to harness the full power of music and theatre karen story we are not done with karen story sure you cou do it is a minimalist opera but what if you wanted to stage it as kind of an old school opera opera the kind that they take you on field ships too when you r a kid lit what would that be i aske karnan our interview and she was game to speculate i do not i mean i as a whole opera i mean opera is long maybe it may be the eld from the book would come an pran t surround and sing about the encen asas e ea weni o o n ai a on oi mein aa on a o meany iin on on a a anoo oa o through then or the ols in the story allso you would want the people the people walking around the closet the german people there could be just got to new york aria sung in german

iver got the german there one of the thorist says i think some one called for help in german and the otheras is impossible every one in this country is a goodorette then there is the front desk lady you knowth when thet carrn calls from her eyepad it could be funny if she was all my life is foring i just answer the pone all day and people ask for room survess you cut away im stuck in the closet and finally this is her big moment and she does not even know it fbriebri as in dridt di ed its oin oaonanin o obasont efit dasonten there the husband in this vergion the story we could actually see him out on his odition belting is hard out oblivious to the pain that his wife is going through smither we could incorporate some kind of famous barritown aria i wonder what would be the most appropriate and i ronic ari out for him to be singing il hier now something about love i'm surer or something about being a rescuer as syou talked aby what would be best and we final we settlehen a scene from rigoletto were the title character who loves his daughter more than anything in the world rages against courtiers who have locked her up in a tiny room open up that door he sang mis open up in m de i aa bua aa u a b bn a ba a aaa a b a b got that was great carnal be proud of me crs the combacts of roper arives with the entrance of the housekeeper what should she be in the oper version of

what it would mean to try one of one of our adio stories as a musical i was taken to many musicals as a kid and i think because that my basic sense of what makes a satisfying story actually comes from musicals much more than from from tv or muvis if you think about the classic old musicals it ere on the rufryvan chorus lin its their funny at the beginning and thn ther something really emotional and there about some bigger idea they take you into this world just i just love that and om what you about to heare is our first attempt at a musical base on journalism probably seventy to eighty per cent of what your beut to heare is for batem quotes from interviews the rest is artistic onvention ill say thut from i'm its basted on a true story you may remember from our radio programm back and made twenty eleven at a munch of high schools and palm beach county forida a group of young poice officers were sent under cover to pose as students there were te classes the in the capeteria they had fa facebook accounts of course im there beng a points abut drugs being sold at these schools that is what they were there to deal with and what happened next in this one school was transformed into a musical by a team of people who musually du this on broadway pretty much everybody involvedinis the cast the chorus the musicians the director michal mayor all from broadway words and music are by

city e ruwe have journal as a memoir true story stage as radio drama we have arrived had act two of our show thack too of my send men this next bit of rate of drama is not an experiment for us a musical or at opra we thought it would be smart av one story in to days show where we know what we are doing it tek te radiodrama we actually bring you now and then on the program a true story told on stage by the person that it actually happened to please welcome commedian my probigoyo vety easy following a musical ia i think that my favorite thing about a being married is actually that you can share jokes a with your a wife or husband better funny to you and that person and no one else other than may be your cat a crus when you have a cat your barometer for humor out the window a lassomer my wife ni when on trip to massachusetts and and i called it catsachusetts which is not funny but in our house was the jokeer ali 're going the cats as shosis my wife is i i was a cat was a everyone loves a good pun when you have a cat and we tried to catch the chusetts and when we arrive my wife has a headache and she asked me if i will acclamate ivan that is her cat to the bedroom cause you cannot just put it inder a cat into a house coulds hill explowed and i bringiin h bedroom but im tired from the drive that i fall sleep which is the only thing you can not do when acclamatin in inter a cat to a house since i wake im an hour later ivan is gone he got out and now running round the house when ike an yon my cats can explowed i wake up my wife i sit clo her names jan i say mister fantastit is gone is names ivan and clo gave me a look that i can only describe as divorciyes because before that point i was convinced that we would be married forever and then once i saw the divorce iyes as i o i guess this could endand thif it ended it would look alout tand nou te two of us were running round the house i'm my marriage is falling apar cats can to explowe and we find ivan but we had another major problem in the house which is that they were mice see thasually worse than that because they were the parasitic mice tay what is called toxo plasmoses which me tave a yat if you might know if this says thive a parasite in them and as the result are unafraid of cats an te unafraid of people and the way we discovered this was that my wife was watching te thee and she looked next to her and there was a mouse and he was watching tea thee also and she screamd and he just looked up at her steard letdle ay wits going on i do not this show either i do not know why all those women would want to marry that one gy and then she pushed him off the couch and he did not even run away he did not even scurry which is a fir invented for mice he just walked into the kitchen a room mat fin'goin the othe room i just think you are over re actev and then he did a confashion all into the mouse cam in the kitchenit was a not here to make friends and here to wend i was here before they came i'll be here when the gon i'm a mouse that from real mouse lides of cats a chusetts that night n i'm sound o sleep in my wite wite's me up bite grabbing my face she says mo an ims mike mister fancast at found the mouse you need to cat the mouse and i sit up i said clo we have a cat we do everything for the cat we give him food we give him an apartment that he thinks is the world we set aside n the area in the apartment for him to poop in that we clean more often than the area where we poo we have a gentleman's agreement that in the unlikely event that a mouse should walk in that dog he will kill the mouse wee'll now sli a mouse again he will be project et thats from cap father my wife says mow get the mouse and i sit up and i see what may be the strangest tableau i will ever witness in my entire life i'v been smacking the mouse the mouse flies in the air land gets up walks back towards ive iv been smack thmouse flies in the air land gets up walks back towr ti ivin is thrilled his toy is alive i've a serious slep walking disorder as i am watching this i'm not even really sure it is happening unthing and ov at this tream before my wife says mou get the mouse and she hande my cup i sit up my walked towards the mouse ndthe mouse walked towards me i put the cup over the mose put a magazine under the cup i take the cup into the backyard ni put the mouse into the forese where i can only assoon that he walked into the mouse of a wolf and from that day forward we have called it mousesachusesetts i want a point out something really special that happened there at the end a few minutes ago i prefassed the story with the massachusetts pace pon catsachusetts which we all agreed as a group is mout fonny just moments ago i concluded the story with another massachusetts cace hothat was nearly identical and that was mouse sachusetts and we applauder which means in a way it is were marry eeay to te te the cot ti toc thok hic thi cogld adea t tihe cute ated te co er everybody erry a beryer a mout a oesgate and that story drinks some funny staf to see the viddiure of this entire show she ar to stand whet people are laughing at you real not be sarry this american life that or we have arrived at ac three of our shou at three how do you slow this thing down thi storyes a follow up to a story the rerana couple of years ago which was a full episod of our sha about one of our contributors josh beareman an his family the sad up is that joshes parents got divorce when he was very young and he and his brother ethen ger up with their dad whe is tha physicist howtan su burvanla sangelis joshas mam and is half brother david wive very different way they drifted round an it at been flaeda theywere barely keeping it togethere joshas mam was an o calik david was in aspiring wrapper getting acquainted with the cortzisto together they live in this tiny condo in a retirming community in west palm beach called century village where they did not belong they were not retireese and they were getting to various kinds of jams and crises and josh would have to fly to flater t try to help he nd d spent a lot of time there were you about to hear is an experiment at creating a radio drama which has exactly the same structure as one of the documentry stories on our shou and what is can happen is the real josh bareman is going ta narrate and then instead of going to ouno ti quotes on taper things that we have actors performing scenes that really happened all this really happened in those ding joshes played by josh hamildon his brother david is played by james ranson the story begins last year when real life josh found himself back in far it ot with his two brothers my mother's been in the hospital much by now she is stringered out how to direct the parametics emergency show fers or something to all the best facilities her room at wellington reginalis big and bright 's a corner room with big windows and a nice view although she cannot see it because right now she is connected the state of the art equipmen behind a curtain when i walk in my brother david is there already came in o shes whole thing was a fucked up remixs o the night before christmas because it was the night before christmas it is a story cin'bein ryme shot us taver what happens how she gets from in the holidays ii thought that youwand eate them wer going to bring out to california oh man i do not know why we did not i think was ethan scaduel or we probably just did not try hard enough nonan yen mean you never know when she is goingto get all twisted that i was not en really round anyway were were yo i was with this girl from school this girl tasha i want over to her house early on chrismas eeve ecause hey were having turkey dinner and everything a nor more family i had to get out o century village i was cooped up in ther wi mam she is drive me crazy anyway i'm ma tashas and mon calls and she sounds all drunk right and she is somehaving the car something tha what kind of something i do not know that is what i said it is lik something you would tell me i know an know i know how you feel whatever happene th cargat suk right i ina have ny when to get to her how did she get on think pagy picked her up by the time i got back to the condol next day she is she is pre deep in it but it did not seem that big deal really and n an is she woke up and she was shore of breath it is w for how lon tuesdays a day and you did not call me sooner do she is done this shed a million times i she wann't even that worried about it nd she know won me to run the amulance with her she was ill see later in night day i'm a doctor snider or ore you are you the older brother yes you have a medical pow of rturney yes good and who ise ethen or other brother he is also coming from the held medical powe of returney yes not him no i oh a did your mother go to cornel yes why i she told us what else did she say that she does not conceem melcohall those wwere her last words before going under soon enough whit er all told a very different story the first time thas happen was five years ago when david called and told me he had to remit himself to the local sheriff's office foreclot just a quick jail sentence o and mams in the hospital i flew ta flora that next day and went straight to the i see you a yi o that on that ha well wi i she will never be the same again what areare you the nerologist ony she we have a savig medical consumer here no i sue i am 'm just togon rotation she scored low on the goat test which measures brain function she got a sixty two probably permanently impaired sixty two out out of what a ot of a hundred although i never really score as a hundred oh that is true i took it myself for practice in nursings go i got an eighty ya fer perfect score he' have to be super man of something noft it not ce get a hundred what is a guy the guy who can do anything including karadi lean out o to mito no no no he is dead she would score porly i i no g go the speaker gi who could do anything jesus criest if i was him i never forget any one's name ah he helps she'l realize your full potential he six an ha peach wall come on ladies he is ah tony robins yes exactly dagga tagi e score hundred as the medical professionals discussed how awakening the giant within can toltally boster ner logical scores one of the other nurses came and told me that earlier that had to restrain my mand because even though she was unconscious she would somehow managed to get hold of cigarettes they caught her trying a light one in bed we are not even sure wher she got it the nurse said and that is when i knew my mother would be fine within days she was sitting out completely losid chatting up strangers everyone is favorite this time things were bad enough that i call my brother ethen he can only come in a true emergency because he plays for the ellifill harmonic and he has a couple of kids and ha sketches planed out monts in advance he took the red eyes straight from playing at disny hall o here we are again you doa man a cun your itments war coming anwe could see il nuk yen wonder nice tulks ye though my stage of tire might help me look a little more official shen there i now ethan his working on a giant maular retrospective figanno play all nine synphonies it is something has never been done before oh ah eten this is doctor sniter hy thi to met you ah your mother had a heart attack and she has severe respatory distress nearly ceptic infection if we can get a breathing out or on again recoveries possible but would take a long time and thand what that is a good question that is a good questio if she needs in home care i'll think david could do it thet cannot keep the cable one and if she does not make it what then where is sheven away right he cannot stay at centry village i mean it is a retireming community with a perimeter it is it islike at a jeriatric army base i do not know how it has gotten kicked out already the definily on to and if they realize mom is not coming back sure we are going to get calls any they know which wone y working on oh they that is at it is a a big one yet it is a big one hats a earely nice passeges to it' mom i know you can hear me we love you and we need you what is it about taturnal life it is david who says that mam would be happy that all three of her boys were together and that is true one of the few real senses of family i can recall with summerson in e west with her and we ware all children years ago nwe made ice cream and caught fireflies and overscate and normal things that that is why david does not being in the room reh now because he does not wone o remember mam this trapp in many tobes it is some jacked up dars vadership he says and yet he is the one who is been in her bedside the most i cannot bring myself to kiss her the way david does i do not know why after he then goes back to california i stay with david an mam time is merciless in florida and especially merciless an i see you day's turn in to weegs and every afternoon a pick up david we go to the hospital talk to some doctors wai talk to some more doctors and then may be get dinner very little changes dont go you aw til one to show you that vidial douts telling you about oh youare right 'll get held up ut up in this very strange vidio david's friend subastion a completely grown man is standing on some floor to crabgrass break dancing robout style and the music is a tinny cassio sounding version a furilease there he is pretty good io for why is this happening i oln't really know i me we all jus hanging out there in a drivway a bunch of us do just arstoing a robot he does ut sometimes right atd it is one time he was doing it my face for really long time for a half houl no ni could not believe it meant e that he could keep it up tellow now i'm old ti had to watch it for long no cause iwas ols lik conttrap there right at first i try not to look and then i could not look away but we she at a yock it ye et it was i was in denial at first and then i accepted a stageis of grieve exactly exactly and then i reach some kind of state of bliss or it was asome i was almost in to you not surage exactly the crue terost model lay she that that one the awson state it is nice penning time with david but i'm also really worried about him he is had a his tory with pills on and off over the years and i suspect it is on again one night whele were driving a dinner david says oh hey josh can we stop over the victory that is a ga station down on okuchoty boulevard and victory is a total miss nomer for the kindonplace for you pull in and just see munch of weard dus crounching round the entrance gets he totally normal social spot and david knows everyone here

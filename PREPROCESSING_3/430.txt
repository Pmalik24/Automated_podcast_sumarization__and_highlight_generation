welcome to the ubermenasciencescience pac toi m andrhubermen and om a professor of narobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine today we are discussing memory in particular how to improve your memory now the study of memory is one that dates back many decates and by now there is a pretty good understanding of how memories are formed in the brain the different structures involved and some of the near chemicals involved we will talk about some of that today often overlooked however is that memories are not just about learning memories are also about placing your entire life into a context and that is because what s really special about the brain and in particular the human brain is its ability to place events in the context of past events the present and future events and sometimes even comminations of the past in present or present in future and on when we talk about memory what were really talking about is how your immediate experiences relate to previous and future experiences to day i am going to make clear how that process occurs even if you do not have a background in biology or psychology i promise to put into language that any one can accsess and understand and we are going to talk about the science that point to specific tools for inhancing learning and memory we ar also going to talk about unlearning and forgetting there are of course instances in which we would to forget things and that too is a biological process for which great tools exist to for instants eliminate ore at least reduce the emotional load of our previous experience that you really did not were that perhaps even was tramatic to you to day youare going to learn about the systems in the brain and body that establish memories you are going to learn why certain memories are easier to form than others and i'm going to talk about specific tools that are grounded in not just one not just a dozen but well over a hundred studies in animals in humans that point to specific protocals that you can use in order to stamp down learning of particular things more easily and you can also leverage that same knowledge to better forget or unload the emotional weight of experiences that you did not we are also going to discuss topics desiavou and photographic memory and for those of you that do not have a photographic memory and i should point out that i do not have a photographic memory either well you will learn how to use your visual system in order to better learn visual and auditory information their protocals to do this grounded in excellent pure reviewed research while you may not have a true photographic memory by the end of the episode you will have tools in hand or i should say tools in mind or in isa and mind to be able to in code and rememor specific events better than you would otherwise before we begin i to emphasize that this podcast is separatefrom my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd the thank the sponsers of to day's podcast our first sponser is athletic greens letic greens is an all in one vitemen mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reasen i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutricional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which oure vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called gop microbiom and the ways in which the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essentialy with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body with out leti greens that get the vitemens i need the minerals i need and the probics to support my microbiom if you' to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock com slash hubermen and claim a special offer the will give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemen d three k too there are ton of dateand ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if we are getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficien in vitemend three and k to is also important because it regulates things cariovascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstock com slash hubermen to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratioes of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar ave talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolites for nerve sell function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium in potassium present in the proparatios all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the proparatioes of electrolytes if you' to try element you can go to drink element that is eleement dok com slash hubermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try elemen you can go to element element dok com slash hubermen oke let us talk about memory and less talk about how to get better at remembering things in order to address both of those things we neeto do a little bit of brain science one o one review and i promises will only take two minutes nd i promise that even if you do not have a background in biology it will make sense we are constantly been bombarded with physical stim ule patterns of touch on our skin light to our eyes light to our skin for that matter smells tastes and sound waves fact if you can hear me sang this right now well that is the consequence of soundwaves arriving into your ears through headphones a computer or some other speaker device each one of an all of those sensory stimule are converted into electricity and chemical signals by your called nervous system your brain your spinal cord and all their connections with the organs of the body and all the connections of your organs of the body back to your brain and spinal court one of the primary jobs of your nervous system in fact is to convert physical events in the world that are non negotiable photons of light are photons of light soundwaves ar soundwaves irs no changing that but your nervous system does change that it converts those things into electrical signals and chemical signals which are the language of your nervous system now just because your being bombarded with all the censory information and being converted into a language that nurons and the rest your nervous system can understand does not mean that you are aware of it all in fact you are only going to perceive a small amount of that sensory information for instance if you can hear me speaking right now you are perceiving my voice but you are also most likely neglecting the feeling of the contact of your skin with which ever surface you happen to be sitting or standing on it is only by perceiving a subset a small fraction of the censry events in our environment that we can make sense of the world around us otherwise reges be overwhelmed with all the things that are happening in any one given moment now memory is simply a bias in which perceptions will be replayed again in the future any time you experience something that is the consequence of specific chains of nurons that we call nural circuits being activated and memory is simply a bias in the likelihood that that specific chain of nurons will be activated again for instance if you can remember your name and i certainly hope that you can well that means that there are specific chains of nurons in your brain that represent your name and when those nurons connect with one another and communicate electrically with one another in a particular sequents you remember your name werd that particular chain of nurons to be disrupted you would not be able to remember your name now this might seem immensely simple but it raises this really interesting question which we talked about before which is why do we remember certain things and not others because according to what i have just said as you go through life youare experiencing things all the time youre constantly bing mombarded with sensory stimule some of those sensory stimula you perceive and only some of those perceptions get stamped down as memories to day i'm going to teach you how certain things get stamped down as memories and i'm going to teach you how to leverage that process in order to remember the information that you want far better now even though i told you that a memory is simply ab ies in the likelihood that a particular chain of nurans will be activated in a partcular secuence again and again it does not operate on its own in fact most of what we remember takes place in a context of other events for instance you can most likely remember your name and yet your probably not thinking about when it was that you first learned your nae this ou generally happens when we are very very young children and yet i'm guessing you could probably remember a time when some one mispronounced your name or made fun of your name or as the case was for me i got to the third grade and there were two andrews and sadly for me i lost the coin flip that allowed me to keep andrew and from about third grade until about on twelfth grade people called me andy which i really did not prefer if you call me indian the comments althoughlyat your comment just gitting does not bother me that much but eventually i reclaimed andrew as my name well it was mine to begin with him throughout but i start od going by andrew again why do i say this well there is a whole context to my name for me and there may ar may not be a whole context to your name for you but presumably if you asked your parens why they named you youre given name you will get a context et cetera that context reflects the activation of other norl circuits that are also related to other events in your life not just your name but probably your siblings names and who your parents are and on and on and on and the way memory works is that each individual thing that we remember or that we want to remember is linked to something by either a close a medium or a very distant association this turns out to be immensely important i know many of you will read or will encounter programes that resign to help you enhance your memory youw they have these a penoms that can remember fifty names in in a roomfull of people or they can remember a bunch of names of novel objects or maybeven in different languages and oftentimes that is done by association people come up with little mental tricks to either link the sound of a word or the meaning of a word in some way that is meaning ful for them and will enhance their memory that can be done and is impressive when we see it and for those of you can do that congratulations most of us cannot do that or at least it requires a lot of effort in training however there are things that we can do that leverage the natural biology of our nervous system to enhance learning and memory of particular perceptions and particular information let us first just talk about the most basic ways that we learn and remember things and how to improve learning in memory and the most basic one is repetition the study of memory and the roll of repetition actually dates back to the late eighteen hundreds early nineteen hundreds when ebbinghouse developed the first called learning curves o learning curves are simply what results when you quantify how many repetitions of something are required in order to remember something in fact it is been said that ebbing house liberated the understanding of learning from the philosophers by generating these learning curves we mean by that well before ebbinghouse came along learning and memory were thought to be philosophical ideas ebbinghouse came along and said well let us ashe take some measurements let us measure how well i can remember a sequence of words or a sequence of numbers if i just repeat them what ebbinghouse did is he would take a sequence of numbers words on a page and he would read them and then he would take a separate sheet of paper and we have to presume he did not cheat and he would write down as many of them as he could and he would try and keep them in the same sequence than he would compare to the originalist and e woul see how many errors he made you do this over and over and over again and as he would expect early in the training and the learning it took a lot more repetitions to get the sequence correct and over time it took fewer sequences and he referred to that difference in the initial number of repetitions that he had to perform verses the later number of repetitions that he had to perform as a called savings he literally thought of the brain as having to generate a kind of a currency of effort and he talked about savings as the reduction in the amount of effort that he had to put forward in order to learn information and what he got was a learning curvin ho can imagine wit that learning curve looked it was at a very sharp peak at th beginning that dropped off over time and of course he remembered all this meaningless information but even though the information might have been meaningless the experiment itself and what ebbing house demonstrated was immensely meaningful because what it said was that with repetition we can activate particular sequences of nurons and that repeated activation lays down what we call a memory and that might all seem a big do but prior to ebbinghouse none of that was known now i should also say ebbinghouse because of when he was alive was not aware of these things that we calle naral circuits it was in nineteen o six that gulgiand gohal got the noble prize for actually showing that nurons are independent cells connected by synapses these little gaps between them where they communicate he may have ben aware of that but the old notion of naral circuits had not really come about nevertheless what the ebbing house learning curves really established was that sheer repetition just repeating things over and over and over again is sufficient to learn something that no doubt had been observed before but had never been formerly quantified now if we look at that result there is something really important that lies a little bit cryptic that is not obvious to most people which is the information that he was trying to learn was not any more interesting the second time than it was the first probably was even less interesting and less and less interesting with each repetition and yet it was sheer repetition that allowed him to remember now sometime later in the early to midnineteen twenty s a psychologist in candida name donald hebb came up with what was called hebb's postulate and heb's postulat broadly speaking is this idea that if a sequence of nurons is active at the same time or at roughly the same time that that would lead to a strengthening of the connections between those nurons and many many decades of experimentation later we now know that postulate to be true nurons themselves are not smart they do not have knowledge every memory is the consequence as i told you before of the repeated activation of a particular chain of nurons and what evnyhow showed through repetition and what donald hebb proposed and was eventually verified through expermentation on animals and humans was that if you encourage the coactivation of nurons meaning have nuron's fire at roughly the same time they will strengthin their connections it leads to a bias in the probability that those nurons will be active again this is vitally important because nowadays we hear a lot about how memories of the consequence of new nurons added in the brain or that every time you learn something a new connection in your brain forms while sorry to break it to you but that simply not the case most of the time and i want to emphasize most not all but most of the time when we learn something it is because existing nurons not new nurons but existing nurons strengthen their connection through coactivation over and over and over through repetition or and this is a very important or or through very strong activation once and only onts in fac there soethng alled one trial learning whereby we experience something and we will remember that thing forever this is often most associated with negative events andi'll explain whyn a few minutes but it can also be associated with positive events the first time you saw your romantic partner or something that happene with that romantic partner or the first time that you saw your child or any other positive event as well as any other extremely negative event again both repetition and i guess we could labelet intensity but were really mean when we say intensity is strong activation of nurons can lay down these traces these circuits that are far more likely to be active again thend had there not been repetition ere not some strong activation of those circuits with that in mine let us return to the original contrary in question that i rais before which is why do we remember anything every day you wake up your nurons in your brain and body are active different nural circuits ar active and yet you only remember a small fraction of the things that happen each day and yet you retain a lot of information from previous days in the days before those and on it is only with a lot of repetition or with extremely strong activation of a given noral circuit that we will create new memoryes and in a few minutes i'll explain how to get extremely strong activation of particular noral circuits repetition is pretty obvious repetition is repetition but in a few minutes i'll illustrate a whole set of experiments and a whole set of tools the point to how you can get extra strong activation of a given neral circuit as it relates to learning that you will remember that information perhaps not just with one trial of learning but certainly with far fewer repetitions than would be required otherwise before we go any further i want a preface to descussion by saing that there are lot of different kinds of memory in fact were you to take a voyage into the norral science and or psychology of memory you would find an immense number of different terms to describe the immense number of different types of memory that researchers focas on but forsake of to day's discussion realy just one of folcus on short term memory medium term memory and long term memory and while there 's still debate as is always the case wat scientists frankly about the exact divisions between short term medium and long tern memory we can broadly define short ter memory and long term memory and we can describe a couple diferent types of those that i think you can relate to in your every day life the most common form of short term memory that were gon a focason is called working memory working memory is your ability to keep a chain of numbers in mind for some period of time but the expectation really is not that you would remember those numoers the next day and certainly not the next week good example will be a phone number if i were to tell you fhoe number forninet three two nine three eight well you c probably remember it for an in three two nine three eight but if i came back to morrow and asked you to repeat that chain of numbers most likely you would not unless of course we used a particular tool to stamp down that memory into your mind and commit it to long term memory now of course in this day and age most people have phone nembers programmed into their phone iey do not really have to remember the exact numbers its usually done by contact identity and forth a different example that some of you are probably more familiar with would be those security cotes you trine log on to an ap or a website and ask you for a security code that is been sent to your text messageis and then you can either plug that in directly in some cases r you after remember that short sequince of anywhere usually from to seven sometimes eight memors your ability to do that to switch back and forth between web pages or aps and plug in that nember by remembering the sequence and plugging it in by texting or or keing it in onon your keyboard that is a really god example of working memory long term memory of the sort that we are gong to be talking a lot about to day is your ability to commit certain patterns of information either cognive information or motor information write the ability move your limbs in a particular sequence over long periods of times such such that you could remembor it a day or a week or a month or maybe even a year or several years later we got shortter memory long term emory and wev got this working memory which is an i keeping something one line but then discarding it o cani not on line on a computea on line within your brain there are also two major categories of memry that i you to know about one is explicit memory this is not necessarily explicits of the sort that youare used to thinking about but rather the fact that you can declare something you have an explicit memory of your name presumel you have an explicit memory of the house or the apartment that you grew up in something and it and you can declarits i can ask you what was the color of the first car that you own or what is the color of your romantic partner's hair these sorts of things that is an explicit declarative memory but you also have explicit pricedral memories now precedual memories as the name suggests involve action sequences the simplest one it is almost ridiculously simple is walking if i say how is it that you walk from one room to the other you would probably say well i go that direction that turn leff i said no nno no how is it exactly that you do it say well i move my left foot han my right foot an my left foot and you could describe that it is an explicit procedral memory much that if you are going to teach a young toddler how to walk you would probably say okey good good tryocan you probably that s can be prelanguage for the toddler but you are going to encourage them to move one leg than the other and you are going to encourage and reward them for moving one leg the than the other because you have an explicit procedrl memory of how to walk cay almost ridiculously simple may even truly ridiculously simple but none the less when you think about in the context of nerl circuits in norl firing pretty amazing even more amazing is the fact that all explicit memories both declarative and procedral explicit memories can be moved from explicit to implicit what i mean by that well in example of walking you might av chuckled a lobet or conshook your head and this a ridiculous thing to ask how to i walk from one room to the next i just walk i just do it ah well what is just do it what it is is that you have an implicit understanding meaning your nervous system knows how to walk without you actually having to think about what about how to walk you just get up out of your chair or you get up out of bed and you walk in the brain you have a structure in fact you have one on each side of your brain scalled the hippocampus the hippocampus literally means sea horse anatomis the name brain structures after things that they think those brain structures resemble when i look at the hippocanpus frankly it does not look a sea horse which either reflects my lack of understanding of what a sea horse really looks a visual defisit or i think it is fair to say that those anatomists were using a little bit of creative om elaboration when thinking about what the hippocampus looks none the less it is a curved structure it has many layers it is been described by my colleague robert supolski by others as looking more a jelly role or a cinamonrole is what it looks to me a and if you were to take one cinamonrol chop it down the middle now you have got two half cinamonroles and rather than put them back together in the configuration they were before you just slide one down that you have got essentialy two ses two c shaped haves of this cinamonrole and you push them together righte slightly offsit from one another well that is what the hippocampus looks to me and i think that is a far better description of its actual physical structure but i guess if you were to use that physical structures the name will then you would have to open up a brain atlass and it would be called two half c cinamonroles stuffed halfway together that is not very goodso i guess s horst will work hippocampus is the name of this structure and it is the siht in your brain and again you have one on each side of your brain in which explicit declarative memories are formed it is not where those memories are stored and maintained it is where they are established in the first place in contrast implicit memories riht these subconscious memories are formed and stored elsewhere in the brain mainly by areas the cerabellum but also the neo portecs the knd of outer shell of your brain the serabellmas literally means many brain and it does in fact look a many brain and is in the back of the brain and the youocortects is the outer part of the brain that covers all the other stuff the hippocampus is vitally important for establishing these new declarative memories of what and what how to do now in order to really understand the roll of the hippocampus in memory in particular explicit declarative and explicit procedural memory and to really understand how that is distinct from implicit declarative an implicit procedural memories we have to look to a clinical case and the clinical caste im referring to is a patient who went by the name h m patients go by their initials in order to maintain confidentiality of their real identity h m had what is called intractable epilepy he would have these really dramaticsocalled grand mall seizures or drop seizures or those of you that no somebody with epilepsy or that have epilepsy you might be familiar with this you can have petitmal seizures which are minor seizures you can ave tonic clonic seizures which are sometimes not even detectable youcan have absent seizures whill people will just stop it is almost as if their brain goes on paws and to stop there is reported actually that instein had absent seizures although i do not know that it isever really been confirmed neurologically grandmall seizures are extremely severe and that is what h m had he could just be going about his day and maybe even cooking or doing something driving operating any kind of m achinery and then all the sudden he would just have a drop seizures he would just physically drop in go into a grand malseizures soch convulsing of the whole body loss of consciousness et cetera or he would feel it coming on oftentimes s peoplith epilepse can feel the eplec seizure coming on collic a wave from the back of the brain and sometimes they can get to a safe circumstance but not always and the frequency in the intensity of his seizures were robost that the narrow surgeons an naurologist decided that they need to locate the origen what they call the fosig of those seizures and remove that brain tissue because the way seizures work is the spread out from that fo focus of that fosi of brain tissue and unfortunately for h m the focus of his seizures was the hippicampus after a lot of deliberation a narro surgeon effact one of the most famous naro surgeons in the world at that time made what are alled ae lectrolitic leizions actually burned out the hippocampus in the brain of h m and as a consequence he lost all explicit memory now the consequence of this was that he could not exist in normal every day life most people he had to live mostly not not entirely but mostly in a kind of hospital setting and i've talke to several people who have who i should say who met h m directly because he is no longer alive but an interaction with him might look the following he would walk up to you just find you would not know that he had any kind of brain damage he could walk fine he could speak fine and you would say hig i'm andrew and hed say high i'm whatever his name happene to be ght he would not say h m but he brotly say his real name and thend perhaps some one knew would walk into the room he might turn around look at that person as any of us might do then turn around back to me and say hi what is your name and if i were to say li just told you my name and you just told me your name dou remember that he would say i'm sorry i do not remember any of that what is your name se you to go through this over and over again i complete lack of explicit declarative memory now he did have some memory for previous events in his life that dated way back oke againd hinting at the idea that memories are not necessarily stored in the hippicampus there just formed in the hippicampus once they have moved out of the ippicampust other brain areas he could still keep those memories there in a different date a base if you will therein a different pattern of firing of other nerl circuits but he could not form new memories now there' some very important and interesting twists on what h m could and could not do in terms of learning in memory that teach us a lot about the brain in fact i think most ner scientists would degree that this unfortunate case of hm's epilepsy and the subsequent nor surgery that he had taught us much of what we know or at least think about in terms of human learning in memory for instance as i mention before he still had implicit knowledge he knew how to a walk he knew how to do certain things make a cup a coffee he knew the names of people that he had met much earlier in his life and on and yet he could not form new memories now in violation to that last statement there were some elements of h m's emotionality that suggests that there was some sort of recidual capacity to learn new information but it was not what we normally think of as explicit declarative or procedrual memory for instance it is been reported or it is been said i should say because i do not know that the studies were ever done with intense physiological measurements that if you were to tell h m a joke and he thought it was funny he would laugh really hard he liked jokes tellment you say h m i want to tell you a joke you tellhim a joke an e'd laugh really hard then you could leave the room come back and tell him the same joke again now keep in mind he did not remember that you told him the joke previously and the second time he would laugh a little bit less and then youd leve the room come back again say hi i'm andrew hes o nice to met you because as you no as you recall because ou can recall things but he could not recall things he did not know that he just met you r at least he couldnt remember it you tell im the joke a third time or a fourth time and with each subsequent telling of the joke he found it a little less funny just as keep this in mind folkes if you tell a joke and you get a big laugh do not tell it again at least not immediately not to the same person or the same crowd because the second time it is a little less funny in the third time it is a little less funny and that i she has to do with e whole element of dopamine and its relationship to surprise and that is the topic of a future pod cast where weu talk all about humor and novelty in the brain but the point being that certain forms of memory seemd to exist in a kind of phantom way within h m's brain what do i mean by that well this underscores the fact that he had an implicit memory of having heard the joke before and it suggests that humor or at least what we find funny is somehow more related to precedures similar to walking or a motorability then it is to this precise content of that joke are i that is a lobit of an abstract concept but the point is that h m lacked explicit declarative memory he could not tell you what he had just heard he could not learn new information and he could not tell you how to do something unless he had learned how to do that something many years prior now there ben a lot of other patients besides h m that have had brain lesins do to epileps or i should say do to surgeries to treat eplepsy do to strokes do to om sadly gunshot wounds and other forms of what we call infar infark i an f a r c t in fark is the word we used to describe damage to a particular brain region and many different patients with many different patterns of infarct have taught us a lot about how memory another a spects of the brain work h m really teaches us that what we know and what we are able to do is the consequence of things that we are aware of and learnings that have been passed off into subconscious knowledge that are body knows are brain knows but we do not know exactly how we know that thing and i tell you the story about h ms ability to understand a joke but that with repeated telling of a joke it has less and less and less of animpact in creating a sense of laughter of humor in h m not is just an anecdote to flesh out his story but because emotion itself turns out to be the way in which we can enhance memories even if those are memories for things that are not funny are not intensely sad are not immensely happy or do not evoke a really strong emotional response or even any reme emotional response and the reason for that is that emotions just perception just sensation are the consequence of particular nor chemicals being present in our brain and body and as i'm going to tell you next there are particular nurchemicals that you can leverage in order to learn specific information faster and to remember it for a much longer period of time may be even forever and you can do that by leveraging the relationship in your nervous system between your brain and your body and your body back to your brain let us talk about tools for enhancing memory and there is one tool that it is absolutely clear works and it is always worked it works now and it will work for ever and that is repetition the more often that you perform something or that you recite something the more likely you are to remember it in the future and while that might seem obvious it is worth thinking about what is happening when you repeat something but when i say what is happening i mean at the nurl level what is happening is that you are encouraging the firing oft particular chains of nurans that reside in a particular circuit wright particular sequence of nuran's playing nurona b c d played in that particular sequents over and over and over again and with more repetitions you get more strengthening of those nerve connections now repetition works but the problem for most people is that they either do not have the patients they do not have the time and sometimes they liteally do not have the time beaus they have got a dead line on something that they are trying to remember and learn or they simply would to be able to remember things better in general remember them more quickly this process of accelerating repetition based learning that your learning curve does not go from having to perform something a thousand times and then gradually over time is a thousand seven hundred fifty times a day five hundred times a day three hundred times t ayen down to now repetitions right you can perform that thing the first time in every time well there is a way to shift that curve that you can essentially establishe stronger connections between the nurons that are involved in generating that memory or behavior more quickly how do you do that well in order to answer that we have to look at the beautiful work of james magau and larry ky hill james mac gau and larry cay hill did a number of experiments over several decades really based on a lot of animal literature but mainly focussed on humans that really established what is required to get better at remembering things and to do very quickly i want to talk about one experiment that they did that was particularly important we will provide a link to this paper it some years old now but the result still hold up in fact the results establish an entire field of memory in narrol science in psychology what they did is they had human subjects come into the laboratory and to read a short paragraph of about twelve sentences and the keything is that some subjects read a paragraph that was pretty mundane the content the enformation within the paragraph was all related to the content of the previous sentence was a cogent paragraph might it just was n't meaningless scramble of words but it described a kind of mundane set of circumstances tit be would be a story about some one who walked into a room sat down in a desk wrote for a little bit than got up and had lunch and i just kind of mundane information not very interesting another group of subjects read also a twelve sentence paragraph but that paragraph included a subset of sentences that had a lot of emotionally intense language or that had language that could evoke an emotionally intense response in the person reading it might have talked about a car accident or a very intense surgery but it also co be positive stuff things a birthday party or a celebration of some other kind or a big sports win in other words you have two conditions of this study people either read a boring paragraph er they read a really emotionally laiden paragraph and again the emotions could either be positive or negative emotions subjects left the laboratory and some time later they were called back to the laboratory and i should say at no point in the experiment did they know they were part of a memory experiment aki they do not know why theyre reing this paragraph they came in either for class credite or to get paid stipialy how these things are done on college campusses or elsewhere they come back into the lab and they would get a pop quiz they would be asked to recall the content of the paragraph that they had read previously ow as is probably expected perhaps even obvious to you the subjects that read the emotionally intense paragraph remembered far more of the content of that paragraph and were far more accurate in ther rememboring of that information now that particular finding was not very novel many people had previously described how immotionally intenss events are better remembered than none emotionally intense events in fact way back in the sixteen hundreds francis bacon whose largely credited with developing the scientific method said quote memory is assisted by anything that makes an impression on a powerful passion inspiring fear for example or wonder shame or joy francis bacon said that in sixteen twenty gimigan lary cahell were certainly not the first to demonstrate or to conceive of the idea that emotionally laid in experiences are more easily remembered than other experiences however what they did next was immensely important for our understanding a memory and for are building of tools to enhance learning in memory what they did was they evaluated the capacity for stress and for particular neuro chemicals associate with stress to improve our ability to learn information not just information that is emotional but information of all kinds i'm going to describe some experements done in animal models just very briefly and then experemons done on human subjects because magaul work mainly on animals also human subjects larycahill almost exclusively on human subjects if you take a rat or amouse and put it in in arena where at one location the animal receives an electrical shock and then you come back the next day you remove the shock of voking device and you let the animal move around that arena that animal will quite understandibly avoid the location where it was shock called conditioned place aversion that effect of avoiding that particular location occurs in one trial that is a good example one trial learning somehow the animal knows that it was shock to that location it remembers that it is a hippocampel dependent learning animals that lackohippocampus or have their hippocampus pharmicologically or otherwise in capacitated will not learn that new bit of information but for animals that do they remember it after the first time and every time unless you are to block the release of certain chemicals in the brain and body and then chemicals are referring to are epinepran a drenolin and to some extent the cortical sterones things cortis all now we know that the effect of getting one trial learning somehow involves epinehran at least in this particular experimental sonario because if researchers do the exact same experiment and they have don thexact same experiment but they introduce a pharmica logical blockor of epinefran that epinepran is released in response to the shock but it cannot actually bind to its receptors and have all f its biological effects will then the animal is perfectly happy to tread back into the area where it received the shock it is almost as if it did not know or we have to assume they did not remember that it receive the shock at that location it all seems pretty obvious when you hear it something bad happens the location on go back to that location that is condition place avoidance but it turns out that the opposite is also true meaning for something called condition place preference you can take an animal put into a norena feed it or reward it somehow at one location in that arena you can give a hungry rat or mouths food at one particular location take the animal out come back the next day no food is introduce but it will go back to the location were receive the food or you can do any variant of this you can make the arena will but chilly and provide warmth at that location or you can take a mal animal and turns out male rats and mice will mate at any point or female animal that that that particular called receptivepase of for mating cycle and give them an opportunity to mate at a given location they will go back to that location and weight in way this is perhaps why we will go back to the same bar or the bar seet at the bar or the same restaon an waigt for cause of the one time they things worked out for them whateever the context was condition place preference condition place preference as with condition place avoidance depends on the release of a drenoline wright's not just about stress it is about a heightened emotional state in the brain and body cau iis really important it is not just about stress you can get one trial learning for positive events condition place preference and you can get one trial learning for negative events here i say posime negative i'm putting what iscalled veilance on a making a value judgements about whetheror not the animal liked it or did not it and we have to presume what the animal liked or did not ind how it felt but this turns out all to be true for humans as well we know that because magon cay hill did experiments where they gaze people a boring paragraph to read and only a boring paragraph to read but one group of subjects was asked to read the paragraph and then to place their arm into very very cold water in factuous ice water we know that placing one's arm into ice water spu shave its up to the shoulder or near to it evokes the release of a drenoline in the body it is not an enormous release but it is a significant increase and yes they measured a drenaline release in some cases they also measured for things cortisall et cetera what they found is that if one evokes the release of a drenaline through this arm into ice water approach the information that they read previously just a few minutes before was remembered it was retained as well as emotionlly intense information but keep a mind that information that they read was not interesting at all at least it wasnan emotionally laden this had to be the effect of a drenaline released into the brain and body because if they blocked the release or the function of a drenaline in the brain end or body they could block this effect now they biology of epinepran and cortesal are litebate complex but their some nuaunts there that is actually interesting in important to us first of all a drenaline is released in the body end in the brain its release in the body from the adrenals remember epineferan and a drenaline are the same thing cortis all is also release from the adrenal lands these too little glands that ratitop our kidneys but it cannot cross into the brain it only has what we call pariferal effects quickening of the heart rate right changes the patterns of blood flow changes our patterns of breathing and general makes our breathing more shallow and faster in general makes our heart beat more quickly et cetera within our brain we have a little braineri called locust serulius which is the back of the brain which has the opportunity to sprinkler the rest of the brain with the neuramodulator epinferan a drenaline as well as nor epinefrnar related oramodulator and to a sentilly wake up or create a state of alertness throughout the brain sas very general effect the reason we have two sites of release is because these nurchemicals do not cross the blood brainbarrier and waking up the body with a drenaline and waking up the brain are too separate called parallel phenomena courtis all can cross the blood brainberry because its lippophylic meaning it can move through fatty tissue and will et into the biology of that in another episode but cortis all in general is released and has much longer term effects and as i've just told you can permeate throughout the brain embody a drenaline has more local effects are at least assegreated between the brain and the body this will turn out to be important later the important thing to keep in mind is that it is the emotionality evoked by an experience or to be more precite it is the emotional state that you were in after you experience something thet dictates whether or not you will learn it quickly or not this is absolutely important in terms of thinking about tools to improve your memory and no i am not going to suggest that every time you ane to learn something you plunge your arm into icewater why will not i suggest that well it will induce the release of a drenaline but their better ways to get that adrenaline releas before i explain exactly what those tools are i want a tampd down the biology of how all this works because in that understanding you will have access to the best possible tools to improve your memory first of all magaw in cahill were excellent experimenalists they did not just establish that you could quicken the formation of a memory by accessing material that was very emotionally laid an or creating an emotional hyodrenaline state after interacting with some thing some words some person some imformation they also tested whether not that whole effect could be blocked by blocking the emotional state or by blocking a drenalan what they did is they had people read paragraphs o either had a lot of emotional content or they had people read paragraphs that were pretty boring but then had them put their arm into icewa er nd i should say they did other experiments two to increase the drentaline their even some shock experiments that were done by other groups any number of things to evoke the release of a drenaline even people taking drugs that increase the drenalie but then they also did what are called blocking experiments they did experiments where they had people get into a highly emotional state from reading highly motional material or they got people to get in to a highly emotional neuro chemical state by reading boring material and then taking a drug to increase the drenaline or ice bath or a shock and then they also administered a drug called a bata blocker to block the effect of a drenaline and related chemicals in the brain and body and what they found is that even if people were exposed to something really emotional or had a lot of a drenaline an their system because they received a drug to increase the amount of a drenaline two manipulations that normally would increase memory keep that n mind if they gave them a batablocker which reduced the response to that of drenaline right no quickening the hartrate no quickening of the breathing no increase in the activity of locustserulias and these kind of wake up signals to the rest of the brain well then the material was not remembered better at all what this tells us is that yes francis bacon was right magon chill were right hundreds if not thousands of philosophers and psychologists and nauro scientists were right in stating and in thinking that high emotional states help you learn things but what magau in khill really showed and what is most important to know is that it is the presence of high a drenaline high emounts of norepinefran and epinefrin and perhaps cortis all as well as you will soon see that a lows a memory to be stamped down quickly it is not the emotion it is the neuro chemical state that you go in to as a consequence of the emotion and it is very important understand that while those two things are related they are not one in the same thing because what that means is that were you to evoke the release of epinefran norepinefran in cort us all or even just one or two of those chemicals after experiencing something you are stamping down the experience that you just previously had this is fundamentally important and far and away different then the idea that we remember things because they are important to us are because they evoke emotion that is true but the real reason that neur chemical reason the mechanism behind all that is these neurochemicals have the ability to strength in neurol connections by making them active just once there is something truly magic about that neurochemical cocktal that removes the need for repetition o caso let us upply this knowledge let us establish a scientifically grounded sed of tools meaning tools that take in to account the identity of the neurochemicals that are important for in hancing learning and the timing of the release of those chemicals in order to enhance learning when i first learned about the results of mgan ca hill i was just blown away i was also pretty upset but not with them i was upset with myself because i realize that the way that i ad been approaching learning in memory was not optimal in fact it was probably in the opposite direction to the enhanced proto cal for learning a memory that i am going to teach you to day my typical mode of trying to learn something while i was in college or while was in graduate school or is a junior professoror teniord professor was to sit down to whatever it is i was going to try and learn perhaps even memorize or if it was a physical skill move to whatever environment i was going to learn that physical skill in and prior to that to make sure that i was hydrated cause that is important to me and certainly can contribute to your brains ability to function your bodies ability to function and general patterns of alertness but also to caffinate i would have a nice strong cup of coffee or expresso i would have a nice strong cup of erbomate and i still drink coffee or yeurbamante very regularly i drink them in moderation i think certainly for me but typically i would drink those things before i would engage in any kind of attempt to learn or memorize or to acquire a new skill now caffine in the form of coffee or yerbamate or any other form of caffine does create a sense of alertness in our brain an body and it does that through too major mechanisms the first mechanism is by blocking the effects of a denisine a denisine is a molecule that builds up in the brain anbody the longer that we are awake and it is largely what is responsible for our feelings of sleepiness and fatigue when we have been awake for a very long time caffine essentially acts to block the effects of a denisine it is a competing agonist not to get technical but it binds to the receptor for a denisine for some pere to time and prevents a denisine from having its normal pattern of action and thereby reduces our feelings of fatigue but it also increases state of alertness while it is reducing fatigue it is also pushing on narro chemical systems in order to directly increase our alertness and it does that inlarge part by increasing the transmission of epineffrnt a drenoline in the brain an body it also has this interesting effect of upregulating the number and or efficiency or we say the efficacy of dopominoreceptors such that when dopominas present and as a mlecule that increases motivation and craving and pursuit that dopomin can have a more potent effect than it would otherwise caffine really hits these three systems it its other systems to but t mainly reduces fatigue by reducing a denizine increases alertness by increasing epineferan release or grenaline release i should say both from the adrenals in your body and from locus terulios within the brain and it can in parallels all that increase the action or the efficacy of the action of dopamy my typical way of approaching learning a memory would be to drink some caffine and then fokis really hard on whatever it is that i'mm trying to learn tryin eliminate distractions and then hope hope hope or try try try to rememor that information as best as i could frankly i felt lik it was working pretty well for me and typically if i leveraged other forms of farm acology in order to enhance learning a memory things alphag p c or phosphatital cyrine i would do that by taking those things before i sat down to learn a particular said of information or before i went off to learn a particular physical skill now for those of you out there listeing in this your probably thinking well o k the results of magone k hill pointed to the fact that having a drenaline released after learning something enhanced learning of that thing but allot of these things kaffine or alphag p c can increase upineferin and a drenaline or dopamine or other molecules in the brain and body they can hance memory for a long period of time tmake sense to take it first or even juring learning and then allow that increase to occur and the increase will occur over a long period of time and will enhance learning a memory and while that is partially true it is not entirely true and it turns out its not optimal work that was done by the magau laboratory and other laboratories evaluated the precise temporal relationship between nurichemical activation of these pathways and learning in memory what they did is they had animals and or people depending on the experiment take a drug could be caffine could be in pilform something that would increase a drenaline or related molecules tha create this state of a leartness that are related to emotionality and they had them do it either an hour before thirty minutes before ten minutes before five minutes before learning or during the bout of learning write the reating of the information or the performing of the skill that one is tring to learn or five minutes ten minutes fifteen minutes thirty minutes et cetera afterwards they looked very precisely at when exactly as best to evoke this adrenaline release and it turns out that the best time window to evoke the release of these chemicals if the goal is to enhance learning in memory of the material is either immediately after or just a few minutes five ten maybe fifteen minutes after your repeating that information youare trying to learn that information again this could be cognive information or this could be a physical skill now this really spits in the face of the way that most of us approach learning a memory most of us if we use stimulantes caffine or alphag p c were taking those before or juring an attempt to learn not afterwards these results point to the fact that it is after the learning a memory that you really want to get that big increase in apenefron and the related molecules that will tamp down memory what this means is that if you are currently use in caffin or other compounds d will talk about what those are and safety issues and forth in a moment if you are using those compounds in order to inhance learning an memory by taking them before or juring a learning episode well then i encourage you to try and take them either late in the learning episode or immediately after the learning episode now given everything i've told you up until now why would i say late in the learning episode or immediately after well when you injest something by drinking it or you take it in capisil form there is a period of time before that gets absorbed into the body in different substances such is caffin nalphicep you see et cetera are absorbed in from the gotin into the blood stream and reach the brain and trigger these effects in the brain abody at different rates it is not instantaneous some have effects within minutes others within tens of minutes and on trually going to depend on the pharmachology of those things and its also going to depend on whether not yet food in your got what else you happen have circulating in your bloodstream et cetera but at a very basic level we can confidently say that there are not one not dozens but as i mention before hundreds of studies in animals and in humans that point to the fact that triggering the increase of a drenaline late in learning or immediately after learning is going to be most beneficial if your goal is to retain that information for some period of time and to reduce the number of repetitions required in order to learn that information now i want to acknowledge that on previous episodes of this prodcast and in appearing onother podcasts i've talked a lot about things non sleep deep rest and naps and sleep as vital to te learning process and i want to emphasize that none of that information has changed i i do not look at any of that information differently is the consequence of what i'm talking about to day it is still true that the strengthening of connections in the brain the literal neural plastesy the changing of the circuits occurs during deep sleep and non sleep deep rest and it is also true and i've mention these results earlier that two papers were published in sell reports sele proternal excellent journal of the last few years showing that brief naps of about twenty to up to ninety minutes some in some period of time after and attempt to learn can enhance the rate of learning in memory however those bouts of sleep the deep sleep that night i should say or those brief naps or even the called enesty are as we call it non sleep deep rest that was used to inhane the learning in memory of particular pieces of information either cognitive or physical information are both that still can be performed but it can be performed some hours later even an hour later it can be performed two hours later four hours later remember it is in these naps and in deep sleep that the actual recon figuration of the neral circuts occurs the strengthening of those naral circuits occurs it is not the case that you need to finish about of learning and drop immediately into a nap or sleep some people might do that but if you really trying to optimize and enhance an improve your memory the data from magon cahill and many other laboratories that stemmed out from their initial work really point to the fact that the ideal protocall would be focus on the thing you are trying to learn very intensely there also some other things erorates et cetera ples see are episodes on learning we have a news letter on how to learn better you can accsess that at huremlabdacomet ta zero cost news letter you grab that pedyf it lists out the things to do juring the learning bout still trying get excellent sleep again fundamentally important for mentel physical health and performance and we can now extend from performance to saying including learning in memory nap if it does not interrupt your night time sleep naps of anywhere from ten to ninety minutes or non sleep deeprest protocalls will enhance learning and memory but we can now add to that that spiking an drenaline provided can be done in a safe way is going to reduce the number of repetitions require to learn and that should be done at the very tale end or immediately after a learning about which is compatible with all the althor protocals that i mention and the reason iam revisiting the stuff about sleep and non sleep debreast as i think that some people got the impression that they need to do that immediately after learning and to daym saying to the contrary immediately after learning you need to go into heighten state of emotionality an alertness now it is vitally important to point out that you do not need pharmocology you do not need caffine you do not need alpa g p c you do not need any pharmocologic substance to spike adrenaline unless that something tht you already are doing or that you can do safely or that that you can do safely and i always say andi'll say it again i'm not a physician 'm not proscribing anything of professor s i profess things you need to do what safe for use o if your somebody who is not used to drinking caffine and you suddenly drink forest bresso after trying to learn something you are going to have a severe increase in aleartness and probably o an anxiety if your penic attack prone please do not start taking stimulants in order to learn things better please be safe i do not you say that to protect me i say that to protect you and i should mention that if you are not accustomed to taking something you always want to first check wit youre doctor of course but also move in to that gradually right stop start with the lowest effective doththe dose the minimal effective dose and sometimes the minaml effective dose is zero melegrams it is nothing why ow i say that well we already talked about results where they put people's arms into an ice bath in order to evokeadrenal in release you are welcome to do that if you want in fact that is a pretty low cost a zero pharmacology at least exogenous farmacology way to approach this whole thing that is a way of avoking your own natural apinaffran and it turns out also dopomine release you could take a cold chower you could do an ice bath or get into a a cold circulating bath we have done several episodes on the utility of cold for health and performance you can find those episodes at hubring labdat cam also the episode with my colleague at stamford from the biology department doctor crag heller lots of protocals in particular in the episode on cold for health and performance that describe how best to use the cold shower or the ice bath or the circulating cold bath in order to evoke epin afrn an dopomine release the point is that the time in which you would want to do those protocals is after ideally immediately after your learning bout meaning when you are sitting down to learn you information or after trying to learn some new physical skill now whether not that is compatible with the other reasons youare doing coldic deliberate cold exposure and whether or not that is compatible with the other things you are doing that depends on the contour of your lifstyle your training you are academic goalls your learningolls et cetera but if youre specific purpose is to enhance learning a memory you want a spike a drentl and afterwards and what i'm telling yous you can do that with kaffine can do that with alphag p c you can do that with ha commination of cafine and alphag p c if you can do that safely some of you i know are using other forms of pharmicology i did a long episode all about eighty eight i after just really declare my stance very clearly that i am not a fan i am actually oppose to people using prescription drugs who are not prescribe those drugs rite in order to enhance a leartness i think there is a big addictive potential there also is a potential to really disrupt one's owne fharmacology around the dopomen urgic system a however some of you i know are prescribed things riddleind ater all and modaphinil in things to that sort in order to crease a lertness and focus for those of you that are prescribe those things from a a you kn bort certified physician you are going ave to decide ifyou aregoing to take them before trying to learn or after trying to learn you will have to take in toe consideration that some of those drugs are very long acting summar shorter acting and time that according to what your tring to learn and when that is formacology but as i've mention there are the behavioral protocols you can use cold and cold is an excellent stimulus because first of all it does not if all farmacology second of all you can generally access it at low to zero cost specially the cold shower approach and third you can ti trate it you can start with warmer water you can make it very very cold if that is your thing and you are able to tolerate that safely you can make it moderately cold how cold should it be in order to evoke a drenalin release well it should be uncomfortably cold but cold enough that you feel you really want to get out but can stay in safely that is going to evoke a drentl in release if it quickens your breathing if it makes you go wide eyed that is increasing a drenalin releae ind fact of those effects of ig wide eyed and quickening of the breathing and the challenges and thinking clearly those are the direct effects of a drenal in on your brain in body and of course there are other ways to increase ta drenalin you could go out for a horrid run you could do any number of things that would increase a drenaline in your body which things you choose is up to you but from a very clear solid grounding in research data we can confidently say that spikin an drenalin after interacting with some material physical or cognim material that youre tryin to learn is going to be the best time to spike that a drenalin now i realize that am being a bit redundant to day or perhaps a lot redundan in repeating over and over that the increase in epinefran should occur either very late in an attempt to learn something or immediately after an attempt to learn something i also want to emphasize the general contour of pharmocalogic effects and of behavial tools to create a drenalin what do i mean by that sentence what i mean is that magau in colleagues explored a huge number of different compounds and approaches everything from the hand into the ice bath to injecting a drenalin to caffine to drugs that block the effects of a drenaln caffine drugs musimall and pecrotox and please do not take those these are drugs that reduce or enhance the amount of a drenlin and the over all take away is that anything that increases a drenaline will increase learning in memory and will reduce the number of repetitions required to learn something regardless of whether not that something has an emotional intensity or not provided that that spike in a drenaline occurs lat in the learning or imediately after and anything that reduces epineferan an a drenalin will inpair learning and that is the key and novel piece of information that i'm adting now which is if you are taking batablockers for instance or if youare trying to learn some thing and it is not evoking much of an emotional response and you are not using any pharmocology or other methods to enhance a drenalin release after learning that thing well you are nock an a learn it very well in fact magan kahil did beautiful experiments in humans looking at how much a drenalin is increased by varying the iemotional intensity of differen things that they were trying to get people to learn or by changing the dosage of epinefran or by changing the amount of epinefran blocker that they injected lots and lots of studies the keything to take away from those studies is that for some people a drenaline was increased six hundred to seven hundred per cent six to sevenfold over base line in the amount of circulating epineferon or drenline and keep it mind sometimes that increase was due to the actual thing they were trying to learn being very emotional positive or negative emotion and sometimes it is because they were using a pharmocalogic approach or the ice bath approach i do not thin they ever used to cold chower approach but that woul have ben a very effective one we can be sure however other people had a zero to ten per cent increase or very small increase in epin effort what we can confidently say on the basis of all those data is that the more epineferan release the better that people remembered the material over and over again this was shown whether not it as for cognitive material to learning a language learning a passage of words learning mathematics or whether nos for physical learning i want to emphasize somethng about physical learning because i know a nember of you are probably drinking a cup of coffee or having a cup of your romate or may be ven an energy drink and taken some alphagpe cee or something before physical exercise i'm not saying that is a bad thing to do or that you would not want to do that but that is really to increase alertness it will not enhance learning at least not as well as doing those things after the physical exercise now again many of you including myself exercise for sake of the physical benefits of that exercise a carty of ascular resistance training but we are not really focused on learning and memory i emphasize this just it is immensely clear to everybody if you want to use those approaches of increasing a drenalin crior to or jurning physical training or cognive work for that matter be my guests i think that is perfectly fine provided that safe for you itonly by moving it to late or after the learning that youre really shifting the role of that a drenalin increase to enhancing memory specifically and as a cautionary note do not think that you can push this entire system to the extreme over and over again or hronically as we say and get away with it in other words you are not can to be able to take a alphag p c and a double expresso do youre focus bowed of work cognive or physical work and then spike a drenaland again afterwards and remember that stuff even better right i'm not encouraging in fact om discouraging you from chronically increasing a drenalin both juring and after a given bowed of work if the goal is to learn why do i say that well work from agan cahill and others has shown that it is not the absolute amount of a drenaline that your release in your brain abody that matters for enhancing memory it is the amount of a drenaline that you release relative to the amount of a drenninlin that was in your system just prior in particular in the hour or to prior get it is the delta as we say it is the difference yu're gen a chronically increase a drenalin you are not an a learn is well the real key is to have a drennalin modestly low perhaps even just as much as you need in order to be able to focus on something pay attention to it and then spike it afterwards this is immensely important because well much of what we are talking about is actually a form of inducing a neuro chemical acute stress meing a brief and rapid onset of stress well chronictrise the chronic elevation of epinaperan and cort us all is actually detrimental to learning and there is an enc higer category of literature mainly from the work of the great and sadly the late a bruce macuan from the rockevill ar university and some of his scientific offspring the great robert supolsky showing that chronic stress chronic elevation of epinepran actually inhibits learning in memory and also can inhimitimune system function whereas acute right sharp increases in a drenalan and court is all actualy can enhance learning enindy can enhance the amian system if you really want a leverage this information you might consider getting your brain and body into a very calm and yet alert state high attentional state that will allow you to focus on what it is that your trying to learn we know focus is vital for incoting information and for trigering neral plasticity but remaining calm throughout that time and then afterwards spiking a drennalan and allowing a drenalan to have these incredible effects on reducing the number repetitions required to learn if you are me youar learning about this information this beautiful work of magon a hill and others and thinking while i should perhaps consider spiking by a drenalin in one former another at the tale end or immediately follow an attempt to learn something and yet we are not the first to have this conversationd nor were magon k hill or any other researchers that iave discussed to day the first to start using this technique in fact there is a beautiful review that was published just this year may of twenty twenty two in the journal nuron sel press journal excellent journal calle mechanisms of memory under stress and i just want to read to you the first opening paragraph of this review which is of the name suggest all about memory and stress heare i am reading and i quote in menieval times communities through young children in the river when they wanted them to remember important events they believe that throwing a child in the water after witnessing storic proceedings would leave a lifelong memory for the events in the child believe are not this is true this is a practice that somehow people arrived at i do not know if they were aware of what a drenalin was probably not but somehow in medieval times it was understood that spiking a drenalin or creating a robust emotional experience after an experience that one hoped a child would learn would encourage the child's nervous system and the aminoa nervous system was but would encourage the brain and body that child to remember those particular events very counter intuitive if you ask me i would have thought that the kid would remember only being thrown into the river my guesses that they remember that but that they the idea here anyway is that they also remember the things that preceded being thrown into the river both interesting and amusing and somewhat om i should sa thought stimulating really that this is a practice that has been going on for many hundreds of years and we are not the first to start thinking about using cold water as in adrenalane stimulus nor are we the first to start thing about using cold water induced to drenaline as a way to enhance learning a memory this is been happening since medieval times up until now i've been talking about the pretty broad contour of these experiments ave been talking bout the te underlying for acology the roll of epineperan and forth have not really talked a lot about the underlying neral mechanisms just can take a min or to and describe those foryo because they are in formative we all have a brain structure called the emigdula a lot of people think its associated with fear but its actually associated with threat detection and more generally and i should say more specifically with detecting what sorts of events in the enbironment are novel and are linked to particular emotional states both positive emotionals thates an negative emotional states the nurons in the imigdula are exquisitely good at figuring out rihthy don' hove their own mind but a detecting correlations between sensory events in the environment that trigger the release of a drenaline and what is going on in the brain and because the imigulis extensively interconnected with other airs of the brain i basely connects to everything in everything connects back to it the immigulas in a position to strengthen particular connections in the brain very easily provided certain conditions are met an those conditions of the ones wev been talking about up in tone up until now emotional saliency that results in increases in epinepran in cortisal or circulating epan effron and coartis all being much higher than it was ten men cirfifteen minutes befor and the net effect of the imigdula in this context is to take whatever patterns of neral activity preceded that increase in ha drenaline in corticosterone and strengthen those senapses that were involved in that neral activity the imigula does not have nowledge it is not a thinking area it is a correlation detector and its correlating neur chemical states of the brain anbody with different patterns of electrical activity in the brain this is important because it really emphasizes the fact that both negative and positive emotional states and the different but somewhat overlapping chemical states that they create or the conditions as we say the and gates through which memory is laid down and gates will be familiar to those of you who have done a bit of computer programming an andgate is simply a condition in which you need one thing and another to happen in order for a third thing to happen you need epinefran elevated and you need robust activity in a particular brain circuit if in fact that brain circuit is going to be strengthened it is not sufficient to have one or the other you need both hence the name and gate and te imigulas very good at establishing these andigate contingencies it is also of very generic brain structure in the sense that it does not really care what sorts of censory events are involved provided the correlated in time with that increase in a drenaline and corticosterone this has a wonderful side and a kind of dark side the dark side is that pitiasti and tramas of various kinds often involve a increase in a drenaline because whatever it was that cause the pitiasi was indeed very stressful cause these big increases in these chemicals and because the emigdula is rather general in its functions right it is not tuned or designed in any kind of way to be specifically active in response to particular types of sensory events or perceptions well then what it means is that we can start to become afraid of entire city blocks where one bad thing happened in a particular room of a particular building in a city block we can become fearful of any place that contains a lot of people if something bad happen to us in a place that contained a lot of people the emigdula is not much of a splitter as we say in science we tok about lumpers and splitters lumpers or kind of generalize a generalizers if that is even a word and i think it is some one wil tell me one wory or the other and splitters are people that are ultra precise and specific and nuantt about every little detail the emigdula is more of a lumper than a splitter when it comes to sensory events other airs of the brain only become active under very very specific conditions and only those conditions and similarly epinefran is just a molecule its just a chemical that circulating in our brain and body there is no epen efferen specifically for a cult shower that is distinct from the epinferan associate with a bad event which is distinct from the epinefran associate with a really exciting event that makes you really alert epinefron is just a molecuites generic asso these systems have a lot of overlap and that can exsplain an large part why when good things happen in particular locations and in the pacompany of particular people we often generalize to large categories of people places and things and when negative things happen in partiular circumstances we often generalize about people places and things associated with that negative event now i'd to talk about other tools that you can leverage that have been shown in quality pereviewed studies to enhance learning in memory and perhaps one of the most potent of those tools is exercise there are numerous studies on this in both animal models and fortunately now also in humans thanks to the beautiful work of people wendy sazuki from new york university wendy'slab has identified how exercize works to enhance learning in memory and other forms of cognition i shoulvention as well as things that can augment can enhance the effects of exercise on learning in memory and other forms of cognition wendy is going to be a guest on this podcast is actually the episode that follows this episode and includes a lot of material that we have not covered to day and shes an incredible scientist and has some incredible findings that i know everyone is going to find eventsly useful in the meantime one to talk about some of the general effecxts of exercise on learning an memory that she is discovered in the other laboratories have discovered fyou recall earlier i mention that learning in memory almost always involves the strengthening of particular senapsis and nural circuits in the brain and not much the increase in the number of nurons in the brain there is one exception however and we now have both animal data and some human data to support the fact that cardiovascular exercise seems to increase whill we call dentate gyris nurogenesis nurgenesis is the creation of new nurons the dentate gyris is a subregion of the hyppocampus that is involved in learning and memory of particular kinds i certain types of events in particular contextural learning but some other things as well sometimes involved in spacial learning lot a debate about exactly what the dente gyris does but forsake of this discussion and i think everyone in the nurosines commete would agree that the dentate gyris is important for memory formation and consolidation the dentate gyris does seem to be one region of the brain certainly in the road int brain but more and more it seeming also in the human brain where at least some new nurons are added throughout the life span and as it turns out that cardiovascular exercise can increase the proliferation of new nurons in the structure and that those nur new nurons scuse me are important for the formation of certain types of new memories their wonderful data showing that if you use exa radiation which is away to eliminate the formation of those new cells or other tools and tricks to eliminate the formation of those cells that you block the formation of certain kinds of learning an memory what does this mean well there ar latter reasons for the statement i am about to make that extend far beyond nurgenisis and the hyppocampus learning in memory but it is very clear that getting anywhere from a hundred and eighty i should say a minimum of a hundred and eighty to two hundred minutes have called zone to cardiovascular exercise this is cardivascular exercise that can be performed at a pretty steady states a which would allow you to just barely hold a conversation sa breathing hard but not superhard sis an sprints or hygh intense the interval training bet doing that for a hundred and eighty to two hundred minutes per week total is it appears the mnimum threshold for enhancing some of the longevity effaxts associated with improvements in cardovascular fitness and we believe that it is indirectly i should say indirectly through enhancements in cardiovascular fitness that there are improvements in hyppicampel dente gyris nurogenesis what does that mean the improvements in cardiovascular function are indirectly impacting the ability of the dente gyris to create these new nurons to my knowledge thereis no direct relationship between exercise and stimulating the production of new nurons in the brain it seems that it is the improvements in blood flow that also relate to improvements in things glemphatic flow the circulation of limp fluid within the brain that are enhancing neurogenesis and that narogenesis is it appears is important now in fairness to the a landscape of nerow science and my colleagues at stamford and elsewhere there is a lot of debate as to whether not there is much if any nerogenesis in the adult human brain but regardless i think the date are quite clear that the hunder anaty to two hundred mits minimum of cardivascular exercises going t be important for other health metrics now it is clear that exercise can impact learning in memory through other non nerogenesis non neu neron tipe mechanisms and one of the more exciting one that has been studied over the years is this notion of hormones from bone traveling in the blood stream to the brain and enhancing the function of the hippocampus the words hormones from bones is surprising to you here to tell you that yes indeed your bones make hornmones we call these indicrant effects in biology we hear about audicrin pericrin and endicrine and those diffent terms referrd to over what distance a given chemical has an effect on a cell forincisisel can have a effect on itself it can have an effect on immediately neighboring cells or can have an effect on both itself immediately neighboring cells and cells far far away in the body and that last example of given chemical or substance having an effect on the cell that produced it plus neighboring cells plucells far away is an indicran effect and a lot of hormones not all work in this fashion hence why we sometimes hereabout endicran and hormone as kind of synonymous terms your bones make chemicals that travel in the blood stream and have these indicrnt effects of their effectively acting as hormones and one such chemicals somethiygcalled osteo calsin now these findings arrive to us through various slaps but one of the more important labs forsake of this discussion today is the laboratory of eric can dell at columbia medical school eric is now i believe in his midtolate nineties still very sharp and has studied learning an memory it also turns out that he is an avid swimmer now i happen to know that eric swims anywhere from a half a mile to a mile a day and again this is anecdate of this is a'm not refering to the publish date of just yet but he credits that exercise as one of the ways in which he keeps his brain sharp and has indeed kept his brain sharp for many many decades and as i ment o before he wellin to his ninety pretty impressive his laboratory has studied the effects of exercise on hippochampal function an memory and other laboratories have done that is well and wat they found is that cardiovascular exercise and perhaps other forms of exercise to but mainly cardiovascular exercise creates the release of osteo c alsin from the bones that travels to the brain and to subregions of the hippocampus and incourages the electrical activity and the formation and maintenance of connections within the hippocampus and keeps the hppocampus functioning well in order to lay down new memories now ostio calson has a lot of effects besides just improving the function of the hippocampus ostiocalson is involved in bone growth itself it is involved in hormone regulation in fact ther really nice evidence that can regulate testastrone and estrogen production by the testesand overies and a much of other effects and other organs of the body because again its acting in this indercrin manner its arriving from bone to a lot of different organs to have effects load bearing exercise in particular turns out to be important for inducing the release of ostio calsin and when you think about this it makes sense a nervous system exists for lotter reasons desenss perceive et cetera you got taste you got smell you got hearing but the vast majority of brain real estate especially in humans is dedicated to two things one vision we have an enormous amount of brain real estate devoted to vision certainly compared to other senses and to movement the ability to generate course movements of the body the generate the ability scuse me to generate fine movements of the body the digets or to wink one eye or o tilt your head in our particular way or move your lips and move your face and do all sorts of different things in a very nuanc and detailed way much of our brain real estate is devoted to movement that it is been hypothesised for more than a half century but especially in recent years as we have learned more about the function of the brain at a really detailed circuit level that the relationship between the brain and body and the maintenance and perhaps even the improvement of nerl circuitry in the brain depends on our body movements and the signal from the body that our brain is still moving think about that how would your brain know if your body was moving regularly and how would it know how much it was moving how would it know which limbs it was moving well you could say if the heart rate is increase then the blood flow will be increased and than the brain will know ah but how does your brain know that its increased blood flow due to movement and not to for instance just stress right mabe you actually cannot moving your very stressed about that and the increase blood flow is simply a consequence of i increased stress the fact that ostio calsin is released from bone and in particular can be released in response to load bearing exercise this would be running again weight lifting has not been tested directly but one would imagin anything involves jumping and landing or weight lifting or body a body weight movements and things of that sort that is a signal to release ostio calsin and we know that signal occurs that is directly reflective of the fact that the body was moving and moving in particular ways in fact you could imagine that big bones your fee mer are going to release more ostio chalcin ore being a position to release more ostio chalcin than five move fine movements the movements of the digits and this idea that the body is constantly signalling to the brain about the status of the body and the verying needs of the brain to update its brain circuitry is a really attractive idea that fits entirely with the biology of exercise ostio chalcin and hypocampal function i do ont amention that i am not the first to raise this hypothesis this hypothesis actualy was discussed in the fair amount of detail by john raidi whose of professor and harvor medical school you wrote a book called spark which was one of the early books leas from an academic about brain plasticity in the relationship between exercise and movement and plasticity and john who i have the good fortion to know has described to me experiments or should they observations of species of of ocean dwelling animals that have at least for the early part of their life a very robostin complicated nervous system but thend these particular animals are in the habit of plopping down on to a rock they find a kind of a safe comfi space and they actually stick to that rock and they do not move any more for a certain portion i should say the late portion of their life and it is at the transition between moving a lot and being stationary that those animals actually digest their own brain they literally metabolize a good portion of their nervous system if they decide on tholy this any more and gobble it up use it for it is nutritional value and then sit there a more on version of themselves with a limited amount of brain tissue because they do not need to move any more now i certainly do not want to give the message that just moving just exercise is sufficient to keep the nerl architecture of your brain healthy young and able to learn while that might be true it is also important to actually engage in attempts to learn new material either physical material new types of movements and skills and or new types of cognive information languages mathematics history a current events aall sorts of things o that involve your brain none the less it is clear that physical movement and cognative ability and the potential to enhance cognint of ability and the ability of learn new physical skills are intimately connected and ostio calcin appears to be at least one way in which that brainbody relationship is established and maintained given the information about ostio chalcin and movement and given the information about spiking an drenaline late or after of period of attempt to learn you might be asking when is the best time to exercise now unfortunately that has not been addressed in a lot of varying detail were every sort of variation on the theme has been carried out and yet whendy sezuki's lap has done really beautiful experiments where they have people exercise generally it was in the morning but at other periods of the day as wel l what they find is that at least as late as two hours after that exercise there is an enhancement in learning in memory now i want to be cleare we do not know whether r not that exercise led to big increases in a drenalin it may be that those forms of exercise were modest enough or din't challenge people enough that they merely got a lot of blood flow going and that the improvements and learning a memory were related to blood flow and we presume increases in austio calson however you could imagine a couple of different logical protocals base on what we have talked about let say you were going to do a form of exercise that was going to spike a drenalin a lot this would be exercise that really challenges your system in forces you can o push through a burn rites o here i'm mainly thing about cratyvascular exercise but it could be a it could even be yoga it could be resistance training if it s going to give you a big spike in the drenalin can it take some serious effort then logically speaking you would want to place that after a learning bout in order to increase learning in memory however if youre using the exercise in order to enhance blood flow and to enhance ostio calsin release in efforts to augment the functionarer hyppocampus i think it stands to reason that doing that exercise some time within the hour to three hours preceding and attempt to learn makes a lot of sense and there on basing it on the human data from when usuzuci's lab on basing it on the studies fror mericandellan from others labs again right now there has not been an evaluation of a lot of different protocols to arrive at the pure review laboratory superprotocol however since wat were talking about is using activityis exercise that most of us probably perhaps all of us should be doing regularly anyway and i do believe most if not all of us should ly regularly be trying to learn and keep our brain functioning well and acquire new knowledge because it is just a wonderful part of life and there is evidence that that actualy can keep your brain young to speak well then exerciseing either befor or after a learning bout makes a lot of sense with the emphasis on after a learning bout if the form of exercise spikes a lot of a drenaline for all the reasons we talked about before o case tht we have talked about two major categories of protocals to improve memory that are grounded in quality pure reviewed science and there is yet another third protocol that will talk about in a few minute but before we do that whent a briefly touch on an aspect of memory in fact two aspects of memory that i get a lot of questions about the first one is photographic memory to be clear there are people out there who have a true photographic memory they can look at a page of text they can scan it with their eyes and they can essentially commit that to memory with very little if any effort whel it might seem to having a photographic memory is a very attractive skill to have should caution you against believing that because it turns out that people with true photographic memory are often very challenged at rememoring thing e that they hear and oftentimes are not good at learning physical skills i's not always the case but often that is the case be careful what you wish for if you you have a photographic memory there are certain professions that lend themselves particularly well to you and indeed a lot of people ith photographic memory have to find they profession and have to move through life in a way that is in concert with that photographic memory again it is a superability it is a hyperability and yet it is not necessarily one that a is desirable for most people there is also this category of what are caled superrecognizers on these people are are i should mention highly employable by government agencies ties are people that have an absolutely astonishing ability to recognize faces and to match faces to templets they can look at a photograph of say somebody on a most wanted list and then they can look at vidio footage of let' say an air port or amall or city street at fairly low resolution and they can spot the person whose face matches that photograph that they looked at even if that vidio or other footage is of people a profiles or even the tops of their heads and just a portion of their forehead these people have just an incredible ability to recognize faces an to templet match and again these people often will take a jobs with agencies where this sort of thing is important a some of you out there probably are superrecognizers and may or may not notice it if you ever have the experience of watching a movi and thought t yourself ow her mouth look much my cousin s mouth or you look at a character and a movier tell o vision sho and you think how they look almost the younger sister of and well then it is very likely that you have this or at least a mild form of this superrecognize her ability that is not memory persay that is the hyper functioning of an area of the brain that we call the fusiform gyris the fuciform gyris is literally a face recognition area and efface templet matching area and it harbors nerons that respond to faces generally as humans and other non human primates cara lot about faces and their emotional content and the identity of faces is superimportant to us for all the kinds of reasons that are probably obvious knowing whose friend whose foe who do well whose famous who is not famous et cetera that is not memory persay and yet if youre superrecognizer or i guess we could call it a moderate face recognizer or not very good at recognizing faces cause indeed there are some people that are kind of face blind they do not actually recognize people when they walk in the room i ease to work with somebody this i walk into his office and heu'd say are you rich or are you andrew i say wil my rich rich wealth rich no and yeed say no are you richard or are you andrew hand i'd say andrew we know each other really once it oh am sorry r my i'm gont of face blind and at actually omtend to be better worse on of depending on how much he was working o ironically the more rested he was the more face blind he would become it was not a sleep deprivation thing that exists that is out there there is the full constellation of people's ability recognized faces that is not really memory and yet visual function is a profoundly powerful way in which we can enhance our memory whether not youare a superrecognizer of faces werethere not you are face blind or anything in between next omen to tell you about a study which points out the immense value of visual images for laying down memories and you can leverageis information and this involves both the taking a photograph something as i shoauld quite easy easily done these days with your phone as well as youre ability to take mental photographs by literally snapping your eyelids shot just briefly want to describe this paper because it provides a tool that you can leverage in your attempt to learn and remember things better the title of this paper is photographic memory the effects of our volitional phototaking on memory for visual and auditory aspects of an experience i really this paper because it refers to photographic memory not in the contect of photographic memory that we normally hereabout where people are truly photographic look at a pageand somehow absorbabale that information and commit it to memory but rather the use of camera photographs or the use of mental camera photographs literally looking at something in deciding blink snapping a to speak snapping a snapshot of whatever it is that you are looking at and re memboring the content reason i this paper and the reason i'm attracted to this issue of mental snap shots is this is something that i'v bee doing since i was a kid i do not know why i star tod doing it but every once in a while i whic thy may be twice a year i would look at something and decides just snap a mental snapsht of it and i've maintained very clear memories of those visual scenes two years ago i was in an uber and i looked out the window and it was a street see now was actually in new york at the time and i decided for reasons that are still unclear to me to take a mental snap shot of this city street image even though nothing interesting in particular was happening and o i do recall that there was a guy wearing yellow shirt walking therewase some construction et cetera i can still see that image in my mind's eye because i took this mental snap shot this paper address is whether not this mental snap shoting thing is real and this is something that i think a lot of people a will resonate with whether not the constant taking of pictures on our phones or with other devices is either improving or degrading our memory you can imagine an argument for both a lot of people are taking pictures that they never look at again and in a sense their outsorcing theire met their visual memory of events into their phone or to some other device and the're not ever accessing the actual imagey and hey're not looking at it right you are not printing out those photos you are not scanning through your phone again sometimes you might do that but most of time people do not most of the photographs that people taking they are not revisiting again the motivation for the study was that previous experiments had shown that if people take photos of a scene or a person or an object that they are actually less good at remembering the details of that scene or object et cetera this study challenged that idea and raised the hypothesis that if people are allowed to choose what they take photos of that taking photos again this is with a camera not mental snapshouting that taking those photos would actually enhance their memory for those objects those places those people and in fact details of those object places and people and indeed that is what they found in contrast to previous studies where people had been more or less told take photos of these following objects or these following people or these fllowing places and then they were given a memory test tot some point later in this study people were given volitional control right they were given agency in making the decision of what to take photos of nill just somrise the results will provide a link to the study shold say that some of the stuffd that they tested was achally pretty challenging am some of them were a pottery and other forms of seramics that a are of the sort tat you see if you go to a big museum in a big city and if you have ever done that you see all the different objects lot of details in those objects and law those objects look a lot a and some will have two handles what some wh have one handle the position of the handles how how broad or narrow these things are heon allottis is pretty detailed stuff they also took photos of other other things basically what they found was that if people take pictures of things and they choose which things they are taking pictures of right s up to them its volitional that there is enhanced memory for those objects later on however it degraded their ability to remember auditory information hat this means is that when we take a picture of something or a person we are stamping down a visual memory of that thing and that make sense its a photograph after all but we are actually inhibiting our ability to remember the auditory the sound components of that visual seene or what the person was saying very interesting and points to the fact that the visual system can out compete the auditory system at least in terms of how they hap pecampus is in coding this information the other finding i find particularly interesting within the study is that it did not matter whether not they ever looked at the photos again whet they actually had people take photos or not take photoes of different objects they had some people keep their photos and they had other people to leat the photos and turns out that whethr or not people kept the photos are deleated those photos had no bearing on whether not they were better or worse it remembering things they were always better remembering them as compared to not taking photos them what dis this mean it means if you really want to remember something or somebody take a photo of that thing or person pay attention while you take the photo what it dosn't really matter if you look at the photo again somehow the process of taking that photo probably looking at it you knowin it camera typically retate through the vieu finder or now because of visual cameras on the the screen on the back of that camera or on your phone that framing up of the photograph stamps down a visual image in your mind that is more robust at serving a memory than had you just looked at that thing with your own eyes very interesting and raises all sorts of questions for me about whether not it is because your framing up a small aperture of small portion of the visual scene that is one logical interpretation although they did not test that i should also say that they found that whether not you looked at a photo that you took or whether not you deleaded it never looked at it again did not just enhance visual memory or the or the memory for those for the visual components of that image but it always reduced your ability to remember sounds associated with that experience that is interesting and then lastbenot least and perhaps most interesting at least to me was the fact that you did not even need a camera to see this effect itif subjects looked at something and took a mental photograph of that thing it enhanced their visual memory of that thing significantly more than had they not taken a mental picture in fact it increased their memory of that thing almost as much as taking an actual photograph with an actual camera and the reason i find thi interesting is that a lot of what we try and learn is visual and for a lot of people the ability to learn visual information feels challenging and will look at something an will trying create some detailed understanding of it will try and understand the relationships between things in that scene it does appear base on the study that the mere decision to take a mental snapshut o chaoman ablink my eyelids and owen take a snapshot of whatever it is i see can actually stamp down a visual memory much in the same way that a camera can stamp down a visual memory of course through vastly distinct mechanisms no discussion of memory would be complete without a discussion of the ever intriguing phenomeno known as dejavou this sense that we have experience something before but we cannot quite put our finger on it where and when did it happen er the sense that we been some place before or that we are in a familiar state or place or contect of some kind now i talked about this on the podcast before at least i think i have and the way this works has been defined largely by the wonderful work of sesumo tonagaua at massachusetts institute of technology and my tee sesumu collected a nobell prize quite appropriately for his beautiful work on immunology and heis also a highly accomplished narrow scientist who studies memory and learning and dejavous and i should also mention the beautiful work of mark maypord at the scripts institute and you see san diego beautiful work on this notion of dejavous heare's what they discovered they have valuated the patterns of neral firing in the hyppicampus as subjects learn new things naronay fires the naron be fires the naron sea fires in a particular sequence again the firing of nurans in a particular sequence the playing of keys on a piano in a particular sequence leads to a particular song on the piano and leads to a particular memory of an experience within the brain they then used some molecular tools and tricks to label and capture those naran such that they could go back later and activate those nurans in either the same sequence or in a different sequence to the one that occurred during the formation of the memory and to make a long story short and to sommarize multiple papers published in incredibly hidh to your journals journals nature and science which are extremely stringent found that whether or not those particular nurans were played in the precise sequence that happen when they incoded the memory or whether or not those nrans were played in a different sequence or even if those nurans were played activated that is all at once with no temporal sequence all firing inconcert all at once evoked the same behavior and in some sense the same nmemory at a noral circuit level this is dejavous this is a different pattern of firing of nurans in the brain leading to the same sense of what happened leading to a particular emotional state or behavior whether or not this same sort of phenomenon occurs when you are walking down the street and suddenly you feel as if how i fee have been here before you meet someone and you feeline ash i feel i know you i feel there some familiarity here thay cannot quite put my finger on we do not know for sure that that is what is happening but this is the most mechanistic and logical explanation for what has for many decades if not hundreds of years has been described as dejavous for those of you that experienced de javous often just know that this reflects a normal pattern of incoding experiences in events within your hyppicampus i know not aware of any pathological situations where the presence of dejavous in hibits daily life some people the sensation of dejavous other people do not almost everybody however describes it as somewhat erie this idea that even though you are in a very different place even though you are intraction with a very different person that you could somehow feel as if this has happened before and just realize this that your hypocampus well it is exquisitely good and incoding new types of perceptions new experiences new emotions new contingencies and relationships of life events it is not infinitely large nor does it have an infinite bucket full of different options of different sequences for osnarons to play an a lotaways it makes perfect sense that sometimes we would feel as if a given experience had happened previously i to cover one additional tool that you can use to improve learning and memory and i should mention this is a particularly powerful one and it is one that i'm definally going to employ myself this is based on a paper from none other then wendy sezuki at new york university talked about her lobut earlier and again she is going to be on the podcast in our next episode and injust an incredible research ihave known wenty for a number of years and it is only in the last i was sa five or six years that she is really shifted her laboratory toward generating protocalls that human beings can use and she is putting that a to great effect great positive effect i should say publishing papers of the sort that im about to describe but also incorporating some of these tools and protocals into the learning corriculum and the liestyle curriculum of students it and joyyou which i think is a terrific initiative you do not need to be an then why you student in order to benefit from her work i'm goingto tell you about some of that work now and she will tell you about this and much more in the episode that follows this one the title of this paper will tell you a lot about where we are going the title is brief daily meditation enhances attention memory mood and emotional regulation in non experienced meditators if ever there was an incentive to meditate it is the data contained within this paper when a briefly describe the study and then i also want to emphasize that when you meditate is absolutely critical i'll talk about that just at the end this is a study that involves subjects aged eighteen to forty five none of whom were experienced meditators prior to this study theye were two general groups in the study one group did a thirteen minute long meditation and this meditation was a fairly conventional meditation they would sit or lie down they would do somewhat of a body skin avaluating for instance how tense or relaxe they felt throughout their body and they would focuss on their breathing trying to bring their attention back to their breathing and to the state of their body as the meditation progrest the other group which we can call the control group listen to of all things a podcast they did not listen to this podcast they listen to radio lab which is a popular podcast for an equivalent amount of time but they were not instructed to do any kind of body scanter pay attention to their breathing every subject in the study either meditated daily or listen to a equivalent duration podcast daily for a period of eight weeks and the experimenters measured a large number of things o variable sas we say they looked at measures of emotion regulation they actually measured cortisall a stress harmon they measured as the title suggest attention and memory and forth and the basic take away of the study is that eight weeks but not four weeks of this daily thir een minute aday meditation had a significant a fact in improving attention memory mood and emotion regulation i find the study to be very interesting and in fact important because most of us have heard about the pausive effects of meditation on things stress roduction or on things such as improving sleep and i want to come back to sleep in a few moments cause it turns out to be very important feature of the study this particular study i much because they used a really broad array of measurements for cogna function things the wisconstan card sorting task on noct and goingto this things the strup task and they also as i mention measured cortus all and many other things imcluding not surprisingly memory and peoples ability to remember certain types of information in fact veried types of information and the basic take away was again that you could get really robust improvements in learning and memory mood and attention from just thirteen minutes a day of meditation now there is an important twist in this study that i want o emphasize tou read in to the discussion of the study it is mention that somehow meditation did not improve but actually impaired sleep quality compared to the control subjects you may think wel why would that be mean meditationis pust to reduce our strass stresses post to inhibit sleep and therefore why would sleep get worse well what is interesting is the time of day when most of these subjects tended to do their meditation most of the subjects in this study did their meditation late in the day this is often the case and experiments i know this because a we run experiments with human subjects in my laboratory and people are paid some amount of money in order to participate or theyr given a something is compensation for being the study but oftentimes the meditation or in the case of my lab the respiration work or other kinds of on things that they are sime to do are not their top top priority and we understand this but in this study the majority of subjects here on reading completed their meditation sand a sessions from eight to somewhere between eight and eleven p m and sometimes even between twelve and three a m think that prartly were a lot of college students and rolled in the study and their hours often or late shifted that impaired sleep and this raises a bigger theme that i think is important many times before on this podcast and certainly in the episode on mastering sleep and o conquering your mastering stress those episodes we talked about the value again of these non sleep deep rest protocals and isty are for reducing the activity of your sympathetic nervous system the the alertness called stress arm of your autonomic nervous sistem will ethat makes you feel really alert enasty are superb for reducing your level of alertness increasing your level of calmness and putting you into a called more paris sympathetic relaxed state meditation does that too but it also increases attention if yo u think about meditation meditation involves focusing on your breath and constantly focussing back on your breath and trying to avoid the distraction of things your thinking or things that your hering and coming called back to your body back to your breath meditation is actually has a high attentional load it requires a lot of prefrontal quartical activity that is involved an attention which thend logically relates to the one of the outcomes of this study which is that attention abilities improved in daily meditators it also points out that increasing the level of attention and the activity of your prefrontal quartex may and i wont empasize may because i'm here i'm speculating about the underlying mechanism inhibit your ability to fall asleep while we have meditation on the one hand that does tend to put us into a calm state but it is a calm very focus state in fact attention in focus are inherent to most forms of meditation non sleep deep rest such as yoganedra as some of it to be or an esti are there is a terrific an asto ar script that is available free on line that is put out by made force ou go to you to an esto are made for you nallsuggest do a search for an asto ar their number of these available out there again at no cost those an esty are protocals tend to put people into a state of deep relaxation but also very low attention and we have to assume very low activation of the prefrontal quartex the take aways from the study are severaful first of all that daily meditation of thirteen minutes can enhance your ability to pay attention and to learn it can truly enhance memory however you need to do that for at least eight weeks in order to start to see the affects to occur and we have to presume tha you have to continue those a meditation training sestions in fact they found that if people only did four weeks of meditation these affects in show up now eight weeks might seem a long time but i think that thirteen minutes a day is not actually that big of a time commitment and the resulse of the study certainly and sentivise me to start adopting a iam going for fifteen minutes a day now i've been at on enough meditator for a number of years i've been pretty good about it lately but i confess i've been doing far shorter meditations of anywhere from three to five or ay be ten minutes i'm going to ramp that up to fifteen minutes a day and i'm doing that specifically to try an access these improvements in cognivability and are abilities to learn also based on the date on this paper i'm going to do those meditation sessions either early in the day such as immediately after waking or close to it i might get my sunshine first i as you all know very big on getting sunlight in the eyes early in the day is much as one can an as early as one can once the sun is out but certainly doing it early in the day and not passe five p m or in order to make sure that i do not inhibit sleep because i think this result that they describe of meditation inhibiting quality e sleep compared to controls is an important one to pay attention to no pone intended to day we covered a lot of aspects of memory and how to improve your memory we talked about the dfferent forms of memory and we talked about some of the underlying neral circuitry of memory formation and we talked about how the emotional saliency and intensity of what your trying to learn has a profound impact on whether not you learn in response to some sort of experience whether not that experience is reading or mathematics or music or language or a physical skill does not matter the more intense of an emotional state that youare in in the period immediately following that learning the more likely you are to remember whatever it is that your trying to learn and we talked about the norchemicals that explain that effect about epinepheran and cortica sterones cortus all and how adjusting the timing of those is key to enhancing your memory ad we talkd about the dferent ways to enhance those chemicals everything ranging from cold water to pharmocology and even just adjusting the emotional state within your mind in order to stamp down and remember experience is better we also talked about how to leverage exercise in particular load bearing exercise in order to evoke the release of hormons ostio chalcin which can travel from your bones o your brain and enhance your ability to learn and we talked about a new form of photographic memory not the traditional type ophotographic memory in which people can remember everything they look at very easily but rather taking mental snap shots of things that you see again emphasizing that that will create a better memory of what you see when you take that mental snapshot but will actually reduce your memory for the things that you hear at that moment and we discuss the really exciting data looking at how particular meditation protocols can enhance memory but also attention and mood however if done too late in the day can actually disrupt sleep precisely because those meditation protocols can enhance attention now i know that many of you are interested in nor chemicals that can enhance learning in memory and i intend to cover those in deep detail in a future episode however forsake of what was discussed to day please understand that any number of different norchemicals can evoke or incan increase the amount of a drenaline that circulating in your brain and body and its less important how one accesses that increase in a trenalone right again this can be done through behavioral protocals or through pharmocology assuming that those behavioral protocols and pharmocology are safe for you it really does not matter how you evoke the adrenaline release because remember adrenaline is the final common pathway by which particular experiences particular perceptions are stamped into memory which answers are very first question rays tof the beginning of the episode which is why do we remember anything at all right that was the question that we raise wh isit that from morning till night and throughout your entire life you have tons of sensory experience tons of perceptions wis at that some are remembered and others or not while i would never want to distill ad important questions such as that down to a one molecule type of anser i think we can confidently say based on the vast amount of animal and human research data that epineferan a drenolin and some of the other chemicals that it acts with in concert is in fact the way that we remember particular events and not all events if you are learning from and or enjoying this podcast plea subscribe to our

out the sponsors mention at the beginning of to day's podcast that is terrific perhaps the best way to support this podcast we lso have a patrion its patrion do calm slash and drew hubermen and there you can support this podcast at any level that you during to day's episode and on many previous episode to the hubermen labpodcast we discuss supplements while supplements are not necessary for everybody many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things enhancing sleep and focus and indeed for learning in memory for that reason the hubermen lab podcast is now partnered with momentous supplements the reason we partner with momentous is severalfold first of all we wanted to have one location where people could go to acts as single ingredient high quality versions of the supplements that we were discussing on this podcast this is a critical issue a lot of supplement companies out theire sell excellent supplements but they combine different ingredients into different formulations which make it very hard to figure out exactly what works for you and to arrive at the minimal effective dose of the various compounds that are best for you which we think is extremely important and that certainly the most scientific way ar rigorous way to approach any kind of supplementation regiment momentous has made these single ingredient formulations on the basis of what we suggested to them and iam happy t say they alsoship internationally whether not youre in the us or abroad theyll ship to you if you to see the supplements recommended on the hubermen labpodcast you can go to livmomentous tot calm slash hubermen they have started to assemble the supplements that we talked about on the podcast and in the upcoming weeks they will be adding many more supplements such that in a brief period of time most if not all f the compounds that are discussed on this podcast will be there again in single ingredient extremely high quality formulations that you can use to arrive at the best supplement protocals for you we also include behavioro protocals that can be combined with supplementation protocals in order to deliver the maximum effect once again that livemomentous dot calm slash hubermen and ifyou are not already following us on twitter an d instergam it is huberman lab on both twitter and instergam there i describe science and science related tools some of which overlap with the content of the huberman labpodcast but much of which is distinct from the content of the huberman labpodcast we also have a news letter called the huberman lab nurl network that news letter provides summery protocalls and information from our various podcast episodes it does not cost anything to sign up you can go to huberman lab doc calm go to the menu and click on news letter you just provide your emale and i should point out we do not share your emale with anyone else we have a very clear privacy policy that you can read there and that news letter comes out about once a month you can also see some sample news letters things the tool kit for sleep or for nurle plasticity and for various other topics covered on the huberman labpodcast once again thank you for joining me to day to discuss the nurobiology of learning an memory and how to improve your memory using science base tools and last but certainly not least thank you for your interest in science

welcome to the huberman laponcetaf science sciencspace to s in i manderhubermen and om a professor of nerbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day i have the pleasure of introducing the first guest of the huberman lad podcast my guest is doctor carl dyceroth doctor carl dyceroth is a medical doctor is a psychiatrist and a research scientist at stamford school of medicine in his clinical practice he sees patients dealing with he range of nervous system disorders including obsessive compulso disorder autism attention defisite disorders sketsophrania mania anxiety disorders and eating disorders his laboratory developsan explores tools with which to understand how the nervous system works in the healthy situation as well as in disorders of the mind doctor dyceros laboratory has pioneer the development and use of what are called channel opsins protenes that come from alogy which can now be introduced to the nervous systems of animals and humans in order to precisely control the activity of nerons in the brain and body with the use of light this is a absolutely transformative technology because whereas certain drug treatments can often relieve certain symptems of disorders they often carry various side effects and in some individuals often many individuals these drug treatment simply do not work the channel obsens and the related technologies stand to transform the way that we treat psychiatric illness and various disorders of movement and perception in fact just recently the channel osens were applied in a human patient to allow an adult fully blind human being to see light for the very first tind we also discuss doctor dycerofs newly released book which is entitle projections a story of human emotions this is an absolutely remarkable book that uses stories about his interactions with his patients to teach you how the brain works in the healthy and diseased state and also reveals the motivation for and discovery of these channel opsencs in other technologies by carl's laboratory that are being used now to treat various disorders of the nervous system and that in the future are certain to transform the fields of psychiatry mental health and health in general i found our conversation to be an absolutely fascinating one about how the brain functions in the healthy state and why and how it breaks down in disorders of the mind we also discuss the current status and future of psychodelic treatments for psychiatric illness as well as for understanding how the brain works more generally we also discuss issues of consciousness and we even delvinto how somebody carl whose managing a fulltime clinical practise and a forty plusperson laboratory and a family of five children and is happily married how he organizes is internal landscape his own thinking in order to manage that immense work load and to p rogress forward for the sake of medicine and his pursuits in science i've found this to be an incredible conversation i learn much i also learned through the course of reading carl's book projections that not only is he in a compris psychiatrist and obviously a th comprish researc scientist and a family man but he is also a pheknominal writer projections is absolutely masterfully written is just beautiful and its accessible to anybody even if you do not have a science background i hope that you will enjoy my conversation with carldisrath as much as i did and thank you for tuning in before we begin i want to point out that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford in my desire an effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public i'd to acknowledge the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponser is athletic greens thletic greens is an all in one vitemen mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve som delited that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens an the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that t helps me cover all of my basic nutricional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which our vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called gup microbiom and the ways in which the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essentialy with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without letic greens it get the vitemens i need the minerals i need end the probiics to support my microbiom if you to triathletic greens you can go to athletic gren stock com slash hubermen and claim a special offer the will give you fi free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemen d three k too threare ton of datand ow showing that vitemend three is essensial for various aspects of our brain and body health even if fofre getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficien inviteem in d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carevascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstock com slash hubermen to claim the special offer of the fifree travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar i've talke many times before in this podcast about the key role of hydration end electrolites for nerve sell function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues an organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the properatios all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolites are not present and ihydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormon systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with el lement you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that you are getting the proparatia as of electrolight if you' to try element you can go to drink element that eleementy do calm slash hubermen and you get a free element sample pack with your purchase theyre all delecious again if you want a try element you can go to element element y docalm a slash hubermet and now my conversation with doctor carl dyceer off thanks for being here thanks for heaving it is been a long time coming for me a because a you may not know this but one o ther reasons i started this pod cast was actually i could have this conversation it is it is but one there are other reasons but one of the goalls is to be able to hold conversations wih colleagues of mine that are doing incredible work in the realm of science and then here we all shave this really special opportunity becaue youare also a clinition you see patient and have for a long time for people that might not be familiar with the fields of naro science et cetera what is the difference between nerology and psychiatry but it is i'm i'm married tonerologist and i am a psychitrist and we make fun of each other all the time oa this is a lot of ner scientists and a lot of brain clinissions actually think these to should be the same field at at' some points in the future they were in the past they started together psychiatry though a focus is on disorders where we cannot see something that is physically wrong where we do not have a measurable there is no blood test that makes the diagnosis there is no brain scan that tells us this is kets of friend this is depression for agn individual patient i psychatry is is much more mysterious and the only tools we have are words neurologis are fantastic physicians they see the stroke on brain scans they see the seizure and the preseizure activity with an g a and they can measure and treat based on those measurables in psychiatry we have a harder job i think we use words we have raiting scales for symptoms we can measure depressionn an autism with rating scales but those are words still and ultimately that is what psychitry's built around it is it is an odd situation because we have got the most complex beautiful mysterious incredibly engineered aobject in the universe and yet all we have are words to find our way and do you find that if a patient is very verbal or hyper verbal you have an easier time diagnosing them as suppose to somebody who is a more quiet and reserved wors i coun imagine the opposite might be true as well but it because we only have words you put your finger on a key point if they do not speek that much in principle it is harder the lack of speech can be symptom we can see that in depression we can see that and negative symptoms of scuizaphrania we can see that in autism sometimes by itself that is a symptom aa reduced speech but ultimately do need something you need a some some words to help guide you and that in fact in there is there is te challenges that i i can tell you about where patients with depression who are depressed they cannot speak that makes it a bit of challenge to distinguished depression from some of the other reasons they might not be speaking and this is a asort of art and the science of psychiatry don do you find that there are a patients that have but let us call them ca morbidities or conditions where they would land in both psychietry and neurology meaning a there is damage toa paticularity of the brain and therefore their depressed and how do you tease that out as a psychiatrist this happens all the time a parkinson's diseaseas a great example a it is a it is a it can be debilitating in many ways a people have trouble moving the trouble walking trouble smallowing and they can have a truly severe depression a and this is you might say oh well they have got a life threatening a illness but there are plenty of neurological disorders where depression is not astrong a strongly comb morbid a symptm a aless lugaris disease for example depression is not a astrong a strongly come morbid in that disease but in parkinsons it is extremely common and as and in parknson's disease we have loss of the dopomin erons in in the in the mid brain and this is a very a a specific population of cells that is dying and probably that leads to both the movement disorder and the depression there many examples of that where these two fields come together and you really needs work as a teem i've had patients in my clinic that i i treat the depression associate with their parkinsons and a neurologist treats the movement associet with the parkinsons and te work together do you think wiu will ever have a blood test for depression in nerse gets of frenar autism and would that be a good were a bad thing i think aultimately there will be quantitative tests a already efforts are being made to look at certain rhythms in the brain using external eegs ad to look at brainwaves effectively look at the ratios of certain frequencies to other frequencies and there is some progress being made on that front a it is not as good as at could be it does not really give you the confidence for the individual patient that you would you would but ultimately what is going on in the brain in psycatric disease is physical a and it is due to the circuits and the connections in the projections in the brain that are a not working as they would in a a typical situation and i i do think will have those measurapbles at some point now is tha good or bad i you knoite i think that will be good one of the challenges we have with a psychietry is it is an art as well as a science to elicit these a symptoms i in a preciseway does take some time and it would be great if we could just to a quick measurement a could it be abused or or or misused a certainly but that is i think true for all of meticin i want to know and i'm sure there are several but what do you see is the biggest challenge facing psychiatry and the treatment of mental illness to day i think we have a we are making progress on what the biggest challenges which i think there is still such a strong stigna for psychatric disease that a patience often do not come to us a and i they feel that they should be able to handle us on their own and thack tac can slow treatment it can lead to yuna worsening symptoms we know for example patience yo have a untreated anxiety assues if you go for a year or more with a a serious untreated anxiety asue that can convert to depression you can add another a problem on top of the anxiety and it would be why do people not come for treatment they they they feel thas is something they should be able to master on their own a which which can be true but a usually aa someholp is is is a good thing that raises it a question relate to something i heard you say many years ago at a lecture which was that on this was a scientific lecture n you said we do not know how other people feel most the time we do not even really know how we feel may ye could elaborate on that a little but and thet the on derth of of waise that we we have to talk about feelings imean there many words i do not know how many but i'm guessing there more than a dozen words to describe the state that i call sadness but as far as i understand we do not have any way of comparing that in it and real objective sense how as a psychitris when your job is to use words to diagnose words of the patient o diagnos dyou maneuvere round that and and what is this landscape that we call feelings fom emotions this is a really interesting i people here we have a theirs attention between the words that we have built up in the clinic that mean something to the to the physicians and then there is the cclocal use of words that may not be the same and that is the first level we have to start out when some one says i'm i'm depressed a what exactly do they mean by that i that may be different from from what we are talking about in terms of depression part of psychiatries to get beyond that word and to get into how ther actually feeling get get rid of the the jargon and get to real world examples of of how their feeling you knon't how do you what how much do you look forward into the future how much a hoped you have how much planning are you doing for thi future these here a nog you are getting into actual things you can talk about that r unambiguous some one says i i cannot even i cannot even think about to morrow i im not i do not see how i'm goin to get to to morrow that that is a nice precise thing that yit is at's sad as tragic but but it is also that means something and we know what that means that is the hopelessness symtem of depression and and that is what i try to do when i joa sy cat gan if you i try to get past the jargon and get to what is actually happening in the patients life and in in e mind but as you say ultimately younowtes shows up across i i i address the issure every day in life whether its in the lab whereer were looking at animals whether fish or mice a rats and studying there behaviour or whenn an a conversation with just a a friend or a colleague or i'm talking to patien i never really know what is going on inside the mind of the other person i get i get some fee back i get words i get behaviours i get actients but i never rly now and as you said at the very beginning of the question often we do not even have the words and the insight even understand what is going on in our own mind i tink a lot of psyccitris are pretty interespective a that is par of the reason they and up in thaspecialty inso i maybe we spend a little more time than the average person thinking about what is going on within but it does not man we have answers in om this a area of trying to figure out what is going on under the hood through words sounds i certain words i would relate to this a this idea of anticipation and hope im is it fair to say that that somehow relates to the dople mean system an the sense that dopamean is involved in motivated behaviors i mean is that in if i say for instance and i i will not ask you to run a session with me here arfree a to that i ci get ri a if i were to say i i just cannot imagine the to morrow i just its i i just cannot do it that is that is not action base that is purely based on my my internal narrative im but i could imagine things i i have a terrible time sleeping i'm not hungry i'm not eating statements about physical actions i'm guessing also have om validity that' and there are noways to measure the accuracy of those statements for instance if i gave you permission you could know if i slept last nigh or whether not i was just saying i had a poor night sleepa ni in moving forward through twenty twenty one and in the next ten and hundred years of psychietry do you think that the body reporting some of the actions of a human i' are going to become useful and and met mash with the words in a way that is can to make your job ease ear i do think that is tue anees the two things you have mentioned eating and sleeping those are additional a a criteria that we use to diagnos depression thes are the vegetative sines we call them of depression poor sleep in poor eating and if you have a base line for somebody that is the real challenge what is different in that person some people would depress they sleep more some people woutd who are depress they sleep less some people who are depressed their more physically agitated and a move around more some people who ard topress they they move less even all their ly and you need here is the challenge s yu can' just look at how they are now you have to get a a base line o and then see how it is changed and that can be a challenge that raises you ethical issies a how do you how tyou collect that base line information from some one healthy i do not i do not think that is something we have solved of course youo with phones and exholerometers and pones a you could in principl collect a lot of base line information from people but that would have to be a treated very a carefully have for privacy reasons and in terms of measuring one's own behaviour i i've heard of work that is going on amsam golden up in the iverseyo washington e who works on a gression in animal models with telling me that ther's some effort that he is making and perhaps y youre involved in this work as well i do not know of m devices that would allow people to detect for instance when their veering towards a depressive episode for themselves that they may choose were not choose to report that to their clonation maybe they do not even hawe a clinition maybe this person that you referred to it t beginning o this person who does not feel comfortable coming to talk to you they om maybe something is measuring changes in the inflection of their voice where the the speed at which they get up from a chair do you think that those kind of metrics will eventually inform somebody hay in na year in trouble this is getting to this question of aback to the statement that i heard you make and wrung in my mind now i think for more than a decade which is oftentimes we do not even know how we feel youknow that that i do because that gives the patient the agency to to detect what is going on and even separate from modern tychnology this has been part of the they art of psychietry is to help patients realize that sometimes other people observing them can give them the earliest morning signs of depression we see this very often in in in family though they will notice when the patient is changing before the patient does and then there are things the patient they notice but not correctly ascribed too the on set of depression and a classic example of that is what we call early morning awakening and this is something that can happen very early as people start to slide into depression they start to wake up earlier an earlier you knowjust inexplicably theyr wake as is two a m three a m ye waken they could start yet could start at fiv m could go for an unaring to fall back to sleep unable fall back to sleep exactly h that is and that they may not know what to do withat i could just be fom their prospectives just something hats happening but if you put enough of that information together hat that could be a useful worning sign for the patient an i can help them seek treatment and i think that is a something that could be really valuable interesting in this framework of you not needing words to self report or machines to detect how we feel or and may be in form of a psychiatrist a how patient feels wont a a touch on some of the technologies that you ben involved in building but as a waigt of march in to that are there any very good treatments for psycheatric disease meaning are there currently any pills potions forms of communication that reliably work every time weas work in most patience and could you give a couple examples of great successes of psychiatry if they exist us yo we are fortunate in this coming pack to my a a the joking o between my wife and myself in terms a neurology and psychaetry we actually in psychietry despite the depths of our the mystery we struggle with many of our treatments are actually work work we may be doing better than some other specialties and terms an actually causing yo theirpud benefect for patients we do help patients you kow the patients who suffer from atby the way both medications and talk therapy have been shown to be extremely effective tan many cases a for example people with panic disorder cognic behaviral therapy just working with words helping people identify the early signs when their starting ton tor a panic attack what are the cognitions that are happening you can train people to derail that and and you can very potently treat panic disort of that way hollonged is something that take for on average for motivated in psyhtful patient you can have a a very a youna cook booky series of psessions and a six to twelve sessions or or even less for someone is very a insiyghtful and motivated i it can have a very powerful effect tect quickly a and that is just with words there are many psychatric medications that are very effective for a tha connitions that their treating a antypsycotic medications they have side effects but aoy do they work they really can clear up particularly the positive symptoms of of skets o frania for example the auditory hallucinations the parenoisa people's lives can be turned round by these a we should clarify positive symptoms you mean not positive in that in the quolitative sense you mean posive meaning that the appearance of of something abnormal exactly i thank you for that clarifications when we say positive symptoms we do mean the addition of something that was not there befor a hallucinatient or a paronoisa and that stands in contrast the negative symptoms were something is taken away and tese are patients who are who are withdrawn they they have a what we call thought locking they can even progress for in a sequence of thoughts a both of those can be part of skets of frania the the hallucinations in the paronoisa are more effectuavely treated ry now but they are effectively treated and then this is a a frustrating and yet heartening aspect of psychietry there are treatments electro confulse electric convulsive therapy which is a where it is extremely effective for depression we have patients who nothing else works for them where they cannot tolerate medications and a you can administer under very safe controlled a condition where the patientsbody is not moving their put into very safe a situation wher the body does not move or sees it is just an internal a process that is triggered in the brain this is an extraordinarily effect of treatment for treatment resistant depression at the same time i find it as as as heartening as it is to see patients respond to this with with a a who have severe depression i'm also frustrated by why why cannot we do something more precise than than thas for these very severe cases and people o sought for decades to understand how is it thata seizure is leading to the relief of of depression an we do not know the answer yet we would love to do that people are working hard on that but that is a treatment that does work to a all in all these cases though in psychietry th tha the frustratng thing is that we do not have the level of understanding that a cardeologist has in thinking about the heart the heart is we now know it is a pump it is pumping blood and you can look at everything about how it is working are not working in terms of that frame it is clearly at pump we do not really have that level of what what is the circuit really there for in psychietry a and that is that is what is missing that is what we need to find we can desin truly effective and specific treatments to what you what are the pieces that are going to be required to curatism cure parkins an cureskis of frenia i i would imagine their several belements and bins here a understanding that the natural biology understanding what the activity patterns are how to modify those maybe a you could just tell us what you think what is the the bento box of the perfect cure i think the first thing we need is understanding we need we need ais almost every psychatic treatment has been sarin tipitis the identifi just noting by chance that something that was done for some person also had a side effect lithiumer psyclithian as in as a good example is it true that it was the the urine of guinea pigs given ayon that was given to manic patient that made them not manic is that true i do not have first andknowledge of that tha i would i would defer that but it is is true for essentially every treatment you kow that the antidopressence originally a y a aros as anti tovirculosive drugs for example ly non and this is a it is a classic example for a a innicences is a cross all of of psychietry a and of course this de seizures as well that was notice that patients who had epilepsy they arhad a seizure their and also had depression that they became much at least for a while they were improved after us eisure that is amazing i dn't want to ge off course to the question that i enswering the question i asked but a i've heard before that if ought to stic children get a fever that their symptoms improve is that true i've i've done a fair bit of of work with outism i in my clenical practise i work with a dull outism and i have heard a statements that and indescriptionts that from from patients and their their families a it is a it is that is very hard to study quantitatively because often with a children you have this a a a not as quantitative as you collection of symptom information ot from from from home but i have heard that enough that i think ther there may well be something to that and what is any time you have a fever what is going on whell we know all the sells in the brain and i know this as an electrophysiologist if you just change the temperature by a few degrees everything changes about ow neron's work and that is even just a single noron it is even more likely to be complex and different with a circuit of nurons that are all affecting each other just elevate the temperature litte bit everythings different and it is it is plausible for sore the things that could happen and do happen now a but and yet when you think about outism to take your example yes we see changes but what is the element in the brain that is analogous to the pumping heart when we think about the symptoms of deprestion that is maybe we think about motivation and dopen menerons when we think about outism it is a little more challenging a you had there is a a deficite in a social interaction and incommunication and where is that whereis the whereis that situated what is the keep principle a governing the social interaction a this is but where we need the basic science to bring us a step forward s weins eke this is the process that is going on this is what is needed for the incredibly complex task of social interaction where you have got incredibly rich data streams of sound and meaning i contact body movement and that is just for one person oar if there is a group of people this is overwhelming for people with with outism what is the what is the unifying thene thare it is a lot of information and and that maybe is unmatched in any realm of biology the amount of information coming in through a social interaction pretictly with words language and then that turns our attention as aners scientists we think oke let us think about the parts the brain that are involved an dealing with merging complex data strems the very high inbit rate that need to be fused together into unitary concact and that starts to guide us and maybe we can and we know other animals are social in their own way and we can study those animals and that there is that is how i think about it there is hope for the future thinking about the symptoms as an engineer might and trying to identify the circuits that are likely working a to make this typical behavior happen and now will help us understand how becomes a typical that seems the first to me the first ben of this what i call the bento box a for lack of a a a better analogy that we need to know the circuits we needed not the cells in the various brain regions and and portions of the body and a and how they connect to one another and what the patterns of activity are under a normal cotincort healthy interaction if we understand that then it seems that the next step which of course could be carried out in parallel right that t hat work can be done alongside work where various elements within those circuits are tweet just right the tuning of a piano in the subtle whi or maybe en the replacement of a wholeseta keys if the pianofs lacking key rety you have been very involved in trin to generate those tools to am tell us about channel obsins why yo created them and wer thereat now in the laboratory and perhaps also in the clinic well this is a first whel i give nature a the credit for for creating chawelredobsins these are beautiful a little protens that are made by algi single selled green algy and this a great story in basic science that ar understanding of animal behavior sensation cognition and action in our brains all the way ack to a botanist in the eighteen fifties and eighteen sixties in russia is where the story begins this was a a botanist named andre faminsign who a worked at saint petersburg and he i had noticed in the river a near his laboratory that there were algi that he could look at in a ditiin a saucer he could put them there and we had light shining from the side the green a tinge in tha saucer of water a would a move to a particular distance from the light that he was shining from the side which was an amazing thing if he made the light brighter a the green tinge would back off a little bit to a more automal locations o just the right light level this was plant behavior it was light driven plant behavior and he delves into thes a little bit he identified that he might my croscopy he could see that there were little single selled algy with agella that were swimming a to the to the right light level behaving plants and tus has been a secret that is that is helped us onlock a many principls of animal behavior a turns out a ou not thes algi achieved this in mazing a results with a single gene that incodes single protine what is approtine it is just a little bymocule that does a job in he cell and these are protines that sit in the surface of cells in their surface membrine and when a photon a light particle hits them a they open a lttle por a little hole in the membering and charged particles ions sodium a rush across the por now why do they do that they do that to guide their flagella that signal coming in those ions coming in through the por in response to light guide their flagellar motor that guides them to a particular spot a in the saucer e now that is plan behavior but it turns out as a this movement of ions across the membering this happens also the nurl code in our brains for on or off o sodymions rushing into cells turns them on makes them fire away fire action petentials communicate to the next cell down the the the chain and this is an amazing opportunity because we can borrow these protines in fact we can take the gene that directs the creation of the poti and we can use genetic tricks modern getictricts to put that gene into nurons in the brains of of mamels a a and then use light to turn those cells the specific cells that we put this geniu turn them on their other wa obsins we call them that you can use to turn cells off it is all fast real time you can play in patterns of activity in real time into cells or kinds of cells just as a conductor elicits the music from the orchestra and strings in the woodwinds and and and you can see what matters what matters for sensation what matters for kondnession what matters for action an we call this optogenetics beautiful and i must say it was quite a an honor tor privilege to watch optegenetics move from idea to discovery to the laboratory i think we were postocs at the same time erewhich is living proof that a people move at different rates that is its a joga at my expense bythea but it is real tup in the same semn or la a physically o phenot a professionally butnone the less a it is been a marvellous story thus far and i'd to a maybe could give us i'd to just touch on couple examples of were the technology resides in laboratories now may be the range of animals that it is being used in and some of the phenomenon that a channel op chelmerdosins and a and there related a genes and protines are a s trying to elist it what youve seen a and then i'd to talk about their applicability to the clenek which is i think that the bigger mission if you will this is a this this a whole thing a yowit ispen about now going on seventeen years that we have been putting chanelrod obsens into nurons it started just undrey from inson's work in a in a dish a by two thousand that was in two thousand four and two thousand ceven we were putting these into behaving mice and we were able to to with the thick of a a switch cause them to move one direction or another by two thousand nine soa pase i can your controlling the maseis behavior a exactly in raal time we could make a mouse that was just sitting there doing nothing to then turn left very con sistently in fact go around in a circle in a sens we turn off the light it would stop that was an i opening moment a it took really a few years to make opto genetics work a there was a lot of putting all the thour lot of proms it had to be colved these these channel ord opsens actually do not move many ions that they have a small current small conductons as we say and we had to figure our ways to pack a lot of them into cells without damaging cells and still make them targetable we do not want just be in all the cells cause then becomes just an electrotyou are just stimulating all the cells there nearby we had to keep that specificity make them targetable to just one kind of cell or another while still packing in large numbers of them into those cells and we had to get in the light and safe and specific ways and it took probably about four five years to really create opto genetics between two thousand for in two thousand nine by the end of that time thou we had a all the basic light delivery gene delivery a principles worked out and people started to apply the technology to a fish to rat to mice a to a nonhuman primmates a monkeys and just a a couplea months ago a my colleague a boton roska ind switzerland a succeeded in putting a channelred osens into the eyes of human beings and making a blind person see and that is pretty a cool a this was a patient a patient with retinal degeneration and heprovided a channelred obstininto the eye of of this patient was able to confer some light sensitivity on to this patient that was not there before in amazing paper in discovery i realize it was one patien but it is such in important milesteln and well it is it as yeu say it is very important malstone and and the tha history of that is is very deep a almost ten years earlier a boton roska and i had published a paper in science in human reten a but explant had taken from could avers from someone who had died the living retina taking out a a obsens put into this a a retinal tissue an showing that t that it worked recording from the cells showing that in these human nurons retinal murons that you could get light responses but then from that moment almost ten years of how clenical development goes endis is it a genitherapiese weu've got a all all the regulations and concerns and all that it took almost ten years to get to to this point now where a living a human being i has a new function nality that it was not there before now that is incredibly inspiring a and a it is a it is a it is a beautiful thing i would say tho that the the broad er significance of obtorgetics is really still understanding because once you understand how the circuitry works and which cells actually matter than any kind of treatment becomes more grounded and logical and specific and principaled and whether it is a medication or talk there por brain stimulation treatment with electrical or magnetic means if you actually know what matters that is incredibly powerful and i think no no a not intended to desparage this the beautiful now retinal work and and conferring u novision on on someone whowho con see of course that is wonderful but than that is direct what you might call direct optor genetics and patientes indirect is everything that comes from understanding o can we know these cells matter now for this symptom well how can we target thatas tho cells and help them work better in patience by any means and i think that is the the broader snificance of optor genetics clenically you uld i know botondwell and am you boton share a this incredible a big vision that i think only a clination can really understand your being inclose contact with and a the suffering of patience as a ultimate mode of aidor developing technologies which makes me have to ask did you decide to become a scientist to cure fine cures for mental disease a no i did not a it is a it is really important questions actually look back and and see the steps than brought you to a particular place and that was not a what brought me a initially to science and and it is cate i think to embrace the twist and turns that life a brings ot to you but i was always interested in the brain and a that was something that for me started from a a very early age i was youknow talked about being interospective i i notice ferrior wion i had a a deep love of of poetry and and stories and i i was a voracious reader a and i was amazed by how words could could make me feel in particular ways just the even even separate from their you nw of course dictionary meanings tha the rhythm and how they work together even separate from meaning a and i was stunned by poets that could use words in new ways that were even divorced from their meaning at all and yet could still trigger specific emotions an i was thets this was always fascinating to me a i i wanted to understand that ande i was interestin and and i became interested in the brain and i thought well i man have to study the human brain a because only human beings can a described what is going on inside enough in in college i began to steer myself toward a medicine and with the idea of becoming a nerous surgeon and si i a a came here a to a medical school a and id an eny peage dea programm a planning nur surgery all the way through the first rotation i did at the end of medical school as you do rotations you go through different specialties and some of these ar required rotations everybody has to dis some relective where you can yu can pick what you want to do a i elected to do nurse surgery first even before regular surgery i was that sure i wanted to do it and i loved it had a fantastic time there was n amazing patient wou had a a thylamic damage and there was a neglect in drom where the patient you was not able to be aware of something that was right in front of him even thoug their vision was perveno thvision was perfectly fine exactly a and i was and and i loved the operating room i loved a tha the the rhythm of o suitoring and the precision of it and and i love being able to help patience immediately but then a a required a rotation was in psychietry which i was not looking forward to aat all and that a completely reset my my whole life that that experience in psychietry and and it was it was at that moment that i saw this is first of all the greatest need tha the depth of suffering and tha an the depth of the mystery together and also it was i ost feel little guilty about this it is interesting too yes yes there is yes we can help yes there is need but as a scientist this is amazing that some one's reality can be different for my own what with everything physically as far as we can tell the same a with the measures we have and yet we have got a different reality that is an amazing thing nd if we could not understand that an help ptlese people that would be a just a you a more than anybody could ask for and that is that is how i an it a a taking this path just a a a required rotation in sychintry it all started with poetry and istorted wit poetry that at it at of a respect for poetry ar are there any favorites that you spend time with a on a regular basis i mean thot the ones tho who got me down this path a early on i remember and in childhod in high school a abortis had an immense influence on me a i i i studied spanish all the way through and and and a reading his work he was a a great writer he wrote both in an english and inspanish and and eing able to appreciate his poetry bot n english an spanish was was a pretty nazing thing not many a poets can canyou are biling i i not i would not say now i became at one point i was effectuivaely fluent and spanish and i have a pretty good medical spanish still because nowwy use a spanish all the time innn the clini care i would not claim fulfluencey but it is something i def is all the time that is been very helpful te clinic where has this wonderful as the son of an argentine i grew up hearing about it and i learned that bor is fa favorite city with geneva i spent time in geneva only for that reason it is also turns out of youran interesting city a you developed methods to control nerons with these algy protines using light in twenty fifteen there was is what i thought was a very nice article publish in the new yorker i'm describing your work and the current state of a your work and in the laboratory in the clinic and an interaction with the patient is as i recall woman who is severely depressed and you reported in that article some of the discussion with this patient and then in real time increase the activation of the called vagus nerve this tenth cranial nerve that exstenda the skullan inervates many the vicerun and body what is the potential for channel redopsons ere related types of algy engineering to be used to manipulate the vaguus because i believe in that instance it wasnin channel ops and stimulations electrical stimlassion right or to manipulate for in syne a very small localizes region the brain let me for frame te a lobit differently light of what we are time ata coupleminutes ago my understanding is that if somebody has severe depression and they take any number of the available farmasuitacale agents that are out there assessorise siratoner gicke agents increased opominy increase whatever that sometimes they experience relief but there often serious side effects sometimes they do not experience relief but as i understand it channel obsons in their related technology imprinciple would allow you to turn on or off the specific regions of the brain that lead to the depressive symptems or may be turn up a happiness circuit or an ora a a positive anticipatien circuit where re we at now in terms of bringing this technology to the nervous system and let us start with body and then move into the skull starting with the body is a good example because it high lights the opportunity and and how far we have to go let us take this example of vagus nerve stimulation the vguest nerve it is the tenth cranial nerve it comes from the brain it goes down it enervates the heart evates the gut by enervate i means it sends litte co n actions down to help a guide what happens in these these organs in the abdm and chest a it also collects information back and and there is information coming back from all those organs that go also go through this vaguest nerve the tenth cranial nerve back to the brain and this is somewhat of a of a of a superhighway to the brain then it was the idea and maybe the ideas maybe we could put a little cuff a little electrical a a device around the vaguest nerve itself and maybe have just a pastemaker battery have a little owr source here under the clathical everything under the skin and have a little a cuff in and drive signals and maybe they will get back to the brain a way of getting into the brain without putting something physical into the brain and why the vagues i mean it is there but and it is accessible that is the reasotat's the reason if the reason ges really you are not gitting m not getting stimulating the vaguest to treat depression simply because it is accessible it is started as acti as as an epilepsy a treatment in i it cannot help with eplepsy but yes its somno gt other lows o medicine as a scientist i got this is where i get to chockoleand you say i mean the field of medicine from that perspective from from the perspective of a scientistan outsider the field of medicin as a field that goes in in tickles path ways because the're there it is am i do not know what tos say it is am a little shocking a and we ought at least in my laboratory i always say you never do an experiment because you can you you do an experiment to test a specific hypothes us i mean we there are there are stories people tell u that the solit the the vaguest nerve lands on a particular spot on the brain call the solitary track nuclius which is just one snaps away from the seratone an openme in the northerneso there is a wink to chemical systems in out brain that make it a rational joy it yes it is not i not irrational but i can tell you the even if that we are not true the same thing would have been tried you got to hat it done and tan goes its successible as noand and but and and why was it is not it again not to disparage a what what is been happening in is branch an medicind there is immense suffering treatments many treatments sdo not work and and we try things and and this is how many advances in medicin happen you think about a kidney diosis which has kept many people alive that that was just started by some one saying eh let us let us try thus maybe there is something going up in the blood maybe we can dialie something and helps them yet it worked and and it was just sort of a test pilot mentality we can we can access the blood let us run it across a diosis membering put it back in the body o mi god an actually works and sometimes you do need that that testpolitment tality of course to do it in a in a rigorous safe control away which is what we do and a anyway that is how we weended up a but but still with the vaguest nerve stimulation of case what is it does it ork it has it is eftia approved for depression of this vaguest nurves timulation but on the population level if you average across all people the effectsizes are pretty small some patience it has an amazing effect and i how but some patience it does not work at all and average across everybody effectsizes pretty small how deathing it is working when it does work is it triggering the activation of of nurans that release more sartone in or dopenme it could be but i would say we do not have evidence for for that a n i i i i just do not know but a what is clear is that it is dose limited i in how high and strongly we can stimulate and why it is because it is an electrode and it is stimulating everything near by and when you turn on the vaguest nosting tere the voice patient's voice becomes strangulated and horse they can have trouble swallowing they can trouble speaking for sure i even some trouble breathing because everything in the neck every electrically responsov cell and projection in the neck is being affected by the selectrate and you can go up just far with the intensity and then you have to stop to to your initial question could a more precise stimulation method a optogenic's help in the setting in principle it could because have ut if you would target the light sensitivity to just the right kind of cell let us say sell acs that goes from point a a point me that causes symptom relief of paprticular kind then you are in business you can have not be the only sell thatslight sensitive you not can affect any of the other cells the larings in the fairyings in the projections passing through that is the hope that is the opportunity to problem is that we do not yet have that level of specific knowledge we do not know o k it is the cell starting in point a going to point be that relieves this particulars and we want to fix this key on the piano and then i see two other a steps there required one is to get the channel opsin gene into the cell in the case of button roscian collegues a rescuing vision in this patient they did that by an injection of a virus that does not damage the nurons the virus itself is fairly innocus but carries a cargo and into one time injection the sells express and then they used light to stimulate am let us say i'm depressed on which i do not think i am although now sciting in fror tecatrest au probably can see signs that maybe i am or maybe 'm not but a let us it we put channel opsen in to my a specific branch of the vaguest that we understand is responsible for mood a how we gan to get it in there and then how we gan to deliver the light cause we are not soing about sun light wore standing in front of he light ball necessarily but what a what are the mechanisms for the body we had to solve exactly these questions you are saying how do you get the light and how do you get the gen and in a in a potent and robust in safe way and it is that is now solved and that is not a a challenge there are very safe well tolerated a a gene delivery mechanisms that are called adno associated viruses a vs and these are a things that are associated with the common cold they themselves do not cause a any symptoms they have been engineered and there is been a broad community of a viral engineering this been going on for decades making these a safer well tolerated and ten on we can put the channelredosin gene into these a viral vactors a that deliver the the gen and we can have little bits of additional deina that govern expression only in one kind of cell but not another these are called promoters and nhansers all genetic tricks built up by a very broad community of af great scientiss over the decades we can put these different bits of deina package them into this a v thes il virus and that it can be then injected a into a particular part of the body i and sticking with this vaguest nerve example we know that their particular clumps of nurons there is one called the notos ganglian a that has a clump of sells related to the vguest nerve and you could for example target a little injection into that gangli an would not be an out patient procedure to come in in the morning get your injection may walk out a few hours later answering and that is the gene a then the light delivery this is also something that that a weve worked out weve worked on making very very light sensitive obsins one challenge and an a boton a a would be the the first to state this in fact insolving this promlom for the patient he had to build a goggles that a created much breat much brighter light than the normal an be an lighta delivery because as i mentioned early ar you have to pack a lot of these channel nobsins in they do not have much current you have to really make sure that you have got tense enough light to activate enough of them to cause a stimulation and has to be the right wavelay i be the r going mak to your example of the alogy moving toward or away a a delight it it has to be tune just right could you ar could i'm imagining in my mind as a non engineer i know you also will by hoengineer the i'm imagining a little tiny a blue light emitting a thing object that a little bigger than a clump of cells or maybe about the size of a clump of cells and for those who do not know you kno your credit cardid is about two hunderd my a my crons thick on the side and on my cron is he thousands of a millimeter and we are talking about a little tiny stamp a that basically a half a millimeter in size a all around each adge half a millimetr insizei can imain that being put under my skin and then i would what id a hid an ap on my phone and i'd say i say doctor diser of a'm not feeling great to day can i increase the stimulation you say go for it and then i ran bit up is that hogo i mean that is effect of what we already do with the vaguest neirve stimulatient that the doctor in this case and i i have thes inc som of my patients in the clinic i do vaguus iner stimulation i talk to them i say i i i go through the symptoms i i use the psychatric interview to illi it their internal states and then i have a radio frequency controler that i can dil in right there in real tart then you are holding the remote control essentially to their brain although it is remot remote ctal thre eplestep yeta ye and i can i can turn up i can turn up the frequency i can turn up the intensity a all with the radio frequency and i control and then its its reprogrammed or a redose a and thn the patient can can then leave at the altered dose this is happening now this having right now electrical you do this routine han i did retine lean mi c electrically and your getting the verbal content which as you described earlier is the indication of how well something is working in real time this may be could just describe a little bit of the inner action with that particular patient or or another patient wat what is a typical ark of a narrative as you go from no stimulation to increased stimulation in most in most patience a the actual their peutic effects the benefits actually take i i many days two weeks a and what i'm mostly focasing on in the office in real time is making sure i'm in a safe low side effect i regime and first i talk o the patient you how whowho has been on a particular dose of the stimulation for weeks or or or longer and i i i talk about symptoms how were things over the past a month how is your hope how is your energy lettel a sleep i how what is your mood a and and then we talk with the patient we decide all this is this is not yet where wed to be and then i can turn up the intensity of the stimulation real time in the office i do not in most patiences i do not expect an immediate mood change what i do is i increase tha the dose until a i i next level lop while asking the patient for side effects can you still breathe o c can you still swallow ca and i can hear their voice is well and and i can get in your looking at their fan looking at their face ance i can get a sense is there a am i in a still on a safe side effect i regime and i and and and then you night i i i stop at a particular point that looks safe and then patient goes home comes back a month later and i get the report on how things or that month i asked a if you look at their face cas in your book a you describe the incredible complexity of social interactions and at one point you describe the incredible amount of information that the eyes inform about the brain and and the context of somebody is inner experience whether depressed or happy or otherwise i want to make sure that we get back to how to maneuver them and manipulate the nervous system for sake of mental health but what are you looking for as a vision scientist i think you do not pupils dilating is a sign of arousal but that could be a positive arousal posive ailance excitement or it could be terror you areging to get the same dilation of the pupils a and and i'm always reminding people of these two goodiese are two pieces of brain basiforly they are just outside the cranial vault they are not unlike the vaguest in that sens but they are more of a report then a control nob although the i to think they could be used as control nobs to a without put ang you on the spot again to diagnose me no sonenly i woulde never ask you to do i what the cameras rolling but a what are you looking for that the patient might not be aware of in other words can you see depression in psomebody is eyes and if a patient or if you do not can you see it in there body posture when they walk in realizing of course that a train psychiatris yourself develops an intuitive sense that is aggregating lots of different features of impatient but what about the eyes what is what is going on there the eyes are incredibly rich in information and a as you says you alude to though it is not as if any one miserable conveys all the information you need it is what we what an engineer would say joints isis ixit its it is many things all at once whether they are insyncrany or out of syncrany that that actually a turns out to matter and a you now the eye contact question we all know i contact is incredible important you do not feel connected with with somebody unless you unless theire's mi contact but i contact can go all right too it it can be a it can be too intense or it can be mis time or if there is a some withth autism it can be barely there at all and and this is one of the most striking symptoms of autism as the avoidance of a vi contact as if it is is if it almost as if it is a harmful aa a quantity and is an i immense amount of information you cyou get from the eyes but it is it is the pairing of what is going on on the eyes with everything else going on the body language tha what is a verbal content of what is what is coming out all that together is is is is the art of of psychatry and and social interaction but yu know sometimes you do not have the eye contact nd this is a namazing thing and i do talk about this in the book as well in in many cases in psychaetry sometimes it is over the phone that you have to a make key decisions and as a n i i recall younr vividly beg as a resident a very often you have to take these phone calls from a a people who are not in the hospital people you cannot see cannot see ther i cannot see their body anything about them just the sound of their voice and you can ask them questions and you have to make in some cases life or death decisions is this person truly s idle something that as comes up all the time and i developed over the course of training a and i think all all sychiust do this is you develop a wait a whatever datistream you have whether it is the eyes or whether it is just the sound of voice coming over the phone you learn to home in on that dati stram you have and focuss on it and identify changes and it is quite amazing ii've found that ou can actually a if a patient you can detect very precise changes in mu just from the sound of the voice and and you can have aa realization that all this patients depression is intruved y by by about half just by the tone of ther of their voice and same with eyes you can with enough practice you can get in nough information from the single day to strame to give you some information but when you do have the whole picture that of courses bess many theories out thereabout excessive blinking and lying a lack of blinking in sociout with the i to remind people that a people have varying degrees of lubrication of the eyes yo to also influence the frequency of blinking and presumely have nothing to do with a whether not what their saying is true or not a butting incredible none the less that it is that the eyes are a port old to over all arousals tat unfastening by the facts of light on circating bologing just over all desire to be awake or asleep et cetera the eyes are on the outside of the cranial vault the vaguust is outside a the a the cranieg of all obviously what about the goodies in here parkinsons we know the at least one of the major sights of degeneration and failure that lead to those symptoms am i can ame off any number of other things in your book you talk about the beautiful work done with opticenetics of active versise passive coping that their airs of the brain the banula that make a when active make animals and presumely people a passive and unwilling or uninterested in fighting back against pressures of life where is another region the rafe you stimule that and and they actively cope they they get their grict going and they and they are able to lean ingto life how do how does one get to those structures in it in a focust way and what what is the next to tof five to ten years look well this is this is the promise on that and it is on a time scale athat i think things may start to play out that the specificity ofout ta genetics a is really only useful if you have some id of how to use that specificity am and it is in actually its a frustrating aspect of psychiatry that in many cases the most effective treatments we have have the least specificity electric convost eftherapy being a great example where your causing a brain wide which looks at barbaric but as you mention is effective i mean it is it these days it is it is much more clinically i you kno dohint look one fluid the las scene and latnot on floor over the cucan as now it is a very clinically a safe and stable precedure but i ought what were i i i would say yet is it is it is got this almost medieval lack of o specificity even if the procedures well control in n clinically safe and stable and it it has a it is not very specific your causing a bring why sesure how how could you be less specific than that and we do not know that the the source of the relief we do not we anly it is a dump of neromodulator psyc dopemin in sad eton we do not there certainly is a dump of nor noletters we do not know that that is the the the cause for the relief i and likewise with medications this is an also an interesting thing some of the most effective antiteprescence of the most effective antypsycholics or th once that ar have the most side effects and many examples of this for example the most effective antypsychotic something called clousipine which has some questially has the most side effects a terrible terrible i a defor antagon it has fase we every receptor does it rearly it acts interesting it i has prominent sertonand prominent muscerinic i certainly acts on donp mean our septors but i it had ncauses a blood blood sell a counts howtple feor if if if fum if i were skis o frenic and a i seeing auditory hallucinations et cetera and i took closopine am what could i expect to feel well you would notice a pside effects and you would notice resolution of of symptoms both and son the voices would go away if in in a good situation whthe voices we go way but i would feel not good in my body you would have a you might have dizziness you might have a druing he might have i any number of a a a physical sensations that that would be dueto these off target effects tha the madication acting on these other receptors and i'm certainly not suggesting this but would if somebody without skis offreniato closopine i you have the same side effects presumably a and would not be something that that i would recommend you psychiatrest take the drugs that they prescrae i just finishd up for the third time oliver saces a autobiography which is marvellous and and i highly recommend a people a he certainly took a lot of drugs am e not as part of its professional roll am but just out of curiosity what is the interest or con of roll of of drugs in the field of psychiatry begets for i would imagine for a group of very curious interespec ctive people who are making recommendations about what to take there could actually be some benefit for understanding what the experience of those drugs as for their patient i think that that is true and i i will say that covyn many or most psyciturs have a a a sample tha number of these for exactly the reason that your saying is is to understand better and to helpetreat their patients better and ie ive spoken to people who have really been ihave found this very helpful to noc this this sleep descruption caused by this medication or the libido descruption cause by this other medication while that is that is a big affaction and and it really helps with empathy for the for the patients to understand i'm not sugi not suggesting that the physicions or anybody a a experiment with drugs but i but i am relieved to hear that because i think that when you talking about act accessing somebody is mind end their basic physiology as you mention relate to appetite libido in sleep yo really you really a one is acting is a mechanic of of their the persons whole experience they walk out the office and they have a a life experience a that extends beyond the script and and yet and that at the same time though you cannot let that completely guide your clinical decisions because s i mentions some of these medications have the most side effects they are also the most effective and closipins af great example that will work in pationts where nothing else works and believe me we do not take the step of of clousiping a prescription lightly because of all these the side effects you have to come in for weekly blood or every few weeks a blood self check to make sure that the blood counts are not off i for example but their patients where no other medication works was scets a for ne and clousiping works masing mor welt and and and we do it even though there are the side effects and then this comes back here your question what if we had better an better specifecity well only if we know exactly what were doing is the point and because as we become more refined i we better be right about where were refining to and you maction a day where it will be a single a maybeen outpatient nor a surgery would go in through the scholor the back of the year deliver a small viral injection wone these adenof ors is a little sticker a light omitting dioed is that a it deepen the brain is that how you invision this of it that certainly could happen what i what i actually a prefer as a vision is is still medications a because those are menly invasive i if we knew what we were doing we could make them more specific i have fewar side effects but optrogenetics thatle arm us with true causal understanding and well know i and we are already moving rapidly toward this point will know oke this symptom the loss of pleasure in life that we call anhendonia or the loss of of motivation or or or energy to overcome challenges active coping am these are largely subsurd erved largely control by the circuit or that circuit or the cell thats inhabits thes other circuit and we will know that because of the work done with channel ops exactly yi agree it as that we we never could have the confidence otherwise and we will know that this is the circuit that that underlies the symptom or its resolution and then well get to understand these cells very deeply oket these cells that are causal that do matter who are they what ae they what is their wiring what are the proteens that they manke what are the little things that are on the surface of the cell that could be receptors for specific medications or combinations of receptors that would give us the specificity we need and then armed with that causal and precise and rigorous knowledge then you can imagine medicatien development becoming totally different no longer sarndipitus but truly grounded and causality i see using channel obsens is a way to probe the circuitry and figure out the sights that are diserrupted what patterns of activity are required and then by understanding the constituents of those cells what they express and what they mak then developing drugs that could target those cells not necessarily putting light inducing diodes into the brain or walking around with wire packs attached to our scholar sonme th th that is fantastic an and you i i realized no one has a crystal ball but am what do you think the ark of am of that is meaning are we can a see that in a year in two years three years in let me reframe that if how soon will a pill based treatment for a psychiatric disease be available that targets a specifics at of cells that we know or important bebecause of the work done with channel obsen i think a that is in some ways it is already i happening at the level of individual patience and here it stamfor yet yet a and and in more brodly in terms of a new new drugs new multi center a clinical trials that will play out of the next a few years a and these could be drugs that are already safe and a true rother purposes but we might say ocay now we know that this medication a based on what we know from causal optogatics thi could be useful for this other purpos thi psychiatric symptom and the path a to to helping patience is could be relatively a swift that is very exciting what are your thoughts about a brain machine inher face and am noral link always comes up although i do one to point out it a a tremendous respect for the folks at nurl link can cleing someone who came up through my lab is now there is a nurrou surgeon but a the brain machine in her faceos something that is been happening or a long time now some some of the best work aamong the best work being done here stamford and elsewhere to of course howas the what you just describe compatible with or different thin brain machine in her face meaning devices litte probesar gin a stimulate different patterns of activity and on sumbles of nurans and what are your general thoughts about a brain machine in her face as going forward now i mean it this is a first of all it is an it is an amazing a pscientific discovery approach a as you mention we and others here it stamford are using a electrs collecting information from tens of thousands of nurans in humans i should adt and even yes there is there is a t it is quite even separate from the nurlinc work as you point out many people have been doing this a a a inhumans as well as a non human primates a and this is pretty a powerful it is important this will let us a understand what is going on on the brain in ain psychiatric disease in our logical disease anw'll give a s ydeas for for treatment a it is of course it is still a invasive he still are talking bout putting a device a a into the brain a and that has to be a treated as a as as a situation that has some risks and and a a step that us to be taken carefully i see that as something that will be part of psychietry a in in an long run already with deep brain stimulation a approaches we can help a people with psychiatric disorders and that is putting just a single electra not even aa complex a close loop system ere you' both playing in an getting information back even just a single stimulation electrone in the brain can help people with osd for example a quite powerfully ah and that will become much more powerful when we get to a true brain machine inher face collecting information back stimulating only when you need to if we could identify a pathological activity pattern particular almost tha the prodrum or the early stage of a seizure may be there events hat happen leading up to on some time scale a a psychiatric a symptom we could intervene in a close loop way detect what is happening what starting to go wrong feed that back to the brain stimulation electuro have it be yin that way more efficient and more principle this is is a i think ab that is great it is it is a something that of course will be grounded again and causal understanding will need to know what is that pathological pattern that were detecting and we eeten know that it matters and again that is where otto genics is helping us helping us now oke this this pattern of activity in these cells in these circuits this does mean that there is a particular kind of of symptom that is happening but armed wit that knowledge absolutely that even the even the simple clothes loop device detect in stimulate is goin to be rt of psychation the future and then and then of course as you get to morselves more connections the ability that we have to help people l become more powerful one of the questions i get asked a lot is about o eighty ht and attention defasitiv various kinds i have the a hunch that on one reason i get asked often is that people are feeling really distracted an an and challenged in on funnling their attention and their behavior but no in their number reasons for that of course but what is true eighty eght and what does it look what can be done for it and o what if any roll for channel obsins where these downstream tecnologies that your developing on what are they what are they offer for people that suffer from eightiatiy or have a family member that suffers from eihty ht this is a sa pretty interesting branch of of psychiatry is no question that people have been helped by the the treatments ut there is euactive youan debate over you no what fraction of people who have these symptoms i can i should be be a treated this is typically at or all a stimulents of some concers anvls stanulence that is right on eighty eght its as as its name suggested has a symptoms of ai cannot have either hyperactive a state or an inattentive a states and a those can be completely separate from each other you can have a patient who who a effectively a is is not hyperactive at all but cannot at remain focussed on the the what is going on aroun the body n e mu still but their their mind is darting around that is right wor they can be very hyperacteve with their body novtens probably rarely a somebody hyperacted with their body with their mind is still athough i have to say and this is a a benevolent shout out to button roska boton as an incredibly sharp and focussed mind and his hand movements are extremely exact also i do sometimes wonder whether not our body movements in our head movements are whether not their corneter not is er is a redout of how directed our attention is i i notice i have to think complex abstract thoughts i knows i have to be very still my body has to be almost completely unmoving for me to think very abstractly and and deeply other people are different some people when they are running they get their best thoughts i can' en imagin at my brain does not work that way at all hase to be toldly mostiwuc suc how do you go about that i i i sit a much this you ni i i try to have time ein each day where i am am literally a sitting i a almost in this in this position a but but without distraction and an thinking and and sot's kind of a it is almost meditative in some ways accept its it is not a true meditation but ii am thinking well not moving you are struck if your tring o structure your thoughts yet han not timea interesting but every eady as you say is is is very different and with with ht h t u have the ke thingas we want to make sure that this is present a cross different domains of life school and home to show that it really is a pervase of pattern not something specific to of the teacher of tthe home situation or something and then you can help patience it is interesting that that eght h t is one of those disorders where people are trying to work on quantitative ee g base to dignoses ind theres some progress toward making up a diagnosis with looking at particular externally detectable brainway a ratheso skull cap get som electrotes that do not penetrate the skull mns and this can be done in an hour or two hour session has to be done in clenek yet in the clenek i you have toav the i recording apparatus an som but but but u that is in principle i as y u increasing confidence comes in exactly which measurements i one could even imagine toward yo home test thouh were not there yet mazing i think one of the res i could asked about it much as a lot of people wonder if they have d h t i do you think that some of the life style factors that inhabit us all these days could in do say some clinical or clinical gh d h d meaning if i look at people's phoneuse including my own and i do not think of it a diction it looks to me and feels to me more o c d and i'll come clean here by sayig when i was younger when i was aket i had a grunting tic i used to hide it i shused to hide in the closit cause of my dad would make me stop and that i used to ye i could not feel any relief of my mind until i iwu do is an actually now if i get very tired if i've them pushing long hours it will come back i was not treated for it but i will confess that i've had the experience of i ways sports where i involve a lot at impact fortunally not football because i went to high school were the fobaltin was terrible maybe tht would have avoided more in fact but things scape boarding boxing they bring relief i feel clarity after ahead it which i avoid but ubut i used to say that is the only time i feel truly clear for and then eventually it dissipated by about age sixteen seven hinges disappeared m iave great a empathy for those that feel there is something contained in them that will not allow them to focus somewhat they wont a focus on and these days with the phone and and all these a emale at cetera i i wonder and i empathize a bit when i hear people saying i think i might have ghd h or d d do you think it is possible that our behaviors and oure interaction with the sensury world which is really what phones a emale really are could in duce gh d d or reactivate it you i this is a great question i i think about a lot is n and ye you mention thas this a tick behaviour in yourself it is very common that people have takes have this building up of something that can only be relieved by executing the the tacke which can be moter movement or or localization or even a thought and and people do i think these days do have this if they have not checke their phonen well they do have to build up to build up to build up until they can they can check it an rely tit am and and and there is some similarities there is a little reward that comes with the withtha that the checking ambut the key question in all of psychiatry what we do is we we do not digknow something unless it is desrupting what we call social or occupational functioning you could have any number of symptoms but literally every every psychatric di agknowsis requires that it has to be desrupting someone is social r occupational functioning in these days you checking your phone is pretty adapted that pretty much helps your social land occupational functioning and we cant we cannot make and we cannot make it a psychatric iigknowsis interesting at least in the world of to day no opting out of communication now makes it a makes you it is ameways less adaptof thou i would point to you is an example of somebody who a it is quite good at managing his a interactions at least from it from the outsider perspective i do one ask you a littlebit about you and first of all and i realize this is only a partial list but a you are clenishing you see patient you run a big laboratory how many people are in your laboratory now that is a huge laboratory am from experience i can say that is that is an enormous laboratory you have a family of five children and you are happily married a ti wonderful colleague of ours as well who i does incredible work how how do you organize that a kind of conceptial level the day and the week and i should say what stress mintigation practices if any do you incorporate i've received demails from you at three in the morning ai sometimes send demails at three the morningbe that is when i wake up maybe 'm depressed and but i go back to sleep maybe you just describe a the ark of of the blocks of the day not hour by hour neserry the details of what are in those blocks but how do you conceptialize the day how do you conceptialize the week and how do you feel about how that is a lined up with your your larger gols of a you making sure these five a young people flourish which i here they are a but a hw do you go about this what for most people would just be an overwhelming set of of items well it is a of course a it is sometimes it is just a take it day by day and and a and i i do not do yu bring the horizon into the unit of the day i i i do i do it is at the unit is the day that is right and am what i i try to have in each day is i mentionarlyer some at least an hour of time when i can think an an that can be it can bew whin kins ar napping it can be a actually because i while driving i can do that too i because i am sitting still but a that that is the one thing i try to preserve when i was writing the book i adapted that time to be my my writing time but it was not enough a it is i had to add in a new block of time which was sort of midnight to to a m writing time a and that carving out these even small protected times are very important i there is of course obligations will will expand ta fit fill the time of albal and you have to be disciplined in my at least a i found i had to be disciplined and in truly protecting thas a times where where one can think s that means nofone that means nophon no checking of the fon am i i would when i was writing the book i would i would have a there is a focus mode on tha tha tha a mack book but but f moves the border and you just tave your your your documents and its it is very pure and you do not ha temptation of of distraction i'm a big believer in because the vision in the eyes place such a prominent roll in directing our cognition something you talk about in the book and am really beautifully in i with a lot of depth and rigor a yusing visual tools to harness ones complete mental attention when you do this practice of sitting and just thinking sitting still in thinking you said your eyes are open a are you hearing your own verbal voice although in your head your actually in conversation with yourself ges and and hearing litterally i mean not quite witte i do not actually here a fanation but i i i'm hearing words i and it is i'm i i discovered this about myself other people i think you now ly operate i differently but i'm extremely verbal and how i think that is how all my reasoning as done its with senencees and construction of of a you almost ocquasions with words e complete sentences complete senses or completish anyway a mostly complete and then and when writing the book everything about the writing i would always every sentence was always played out in my mind listening for for rhythem in timing and and and i would obsess over exact placemen of of words to get the writ rhythm of the spoken sentence in my my mind could i do not mean to interrupt your flow but when you do that and having experienced this process of bit although differently do you experience any kind of welling up a of anxiety when your hitting the the friction points m and if do you have tools or a ways that you quell that anxiety in real time cause what were really talking about here is a your mind but what were really telling about is this process of of converting the activity of nurons in to something physically concrete in the world and these intermediate steps are mysterious to everybody we hear just rite the book just do it what whatever that means in fact tha statements that to mere cond of empty and meaning less am but when you hear your voice and your trying to find the correct word and your keep hitting it does not sound quite right what is the experience in your mody ye i it when it is not right it is deathonaly i it its it is aversis i does not feel good am but it is not i'm but i but there is also hope because i know i can solve it to and and there is there is this a it is almost your you are almost there an now you have there is a a path that as there you do not quite see it but it is there and and i i keep that in mind and sothers there is a there is a there is is a prepulsive force forward i because i know that the solution is there and and thats said i now there were there were single words that would occup i would stenddays you because i was just not happy antil i got it right and there were somethings that i never quite got perfect and i left out of the book entirely because it was close but not not quite there and soi an as ie now i cannot ptthat in everything you just said is entirely consistent with my experience of you and the way you go about a everything i aft ask are are your kid's writers did they books in words and and poetry i i know one of your children is going on to a creer in medicine in science ye the there each different which is amazing yet they all i think to have some appreciation orar a lot of appreciation for for for reading am but some are very musical to o the i've are extremely musical very very talented with getar and sing and and vocal impressions i just astonishing and and some of them are r great with drawing and and artistry and and some are very physical and vigorous and and are never i happy except when you weeping about and it is it is just anazing how different they are lestly but i think there is aa shared appreciation for for language do you think the a that one can train their mind in using these practices i i really your description of the am sitting staying physically still and and learning to grapple with thos those challenges it something that specilly in laboratory science we are really train to do i'm many professions were taught to come in and just get into motion and and i found that very relaxing ind some on who proubly has an underling a take or something that it fell grat to be in motion where the hardest things about becoming a university professor and running alad was that i no longer working with my hands and it it felt i was i it woud felt a some big important part of my life had been amputated but what sorts of practic is do yu incorporate there and you think people can learn to get better at focasing through a dedicated practice of the sort that you descrie i think oknow i also you night i i remember the rhythms of of physical work in laboratory very well i a my work a these days is as as the laboratory leader my job has returnd mostly to words now again and and it is its kind of coming ful circle i was a a i it sets a different mode i think you just have to embrace the that different stages of life come with with different motes but you can deftinally train yourself for each mode i was not a i i i loved o the as i mentioned atha the rhythm of of sewing an an in suituring n insurgery a and i worked really hard on that and became good at it and now i i never do it a but it is what is the next challenge you nothers all the various experimental techniques the dissections of the brains yoon i cannot tell you how many thousands of brain to sections i've done in my life now i do not do them at all and then you developed te methods o that we do not have to the setran i shoul mention it maybe tell us for a moment about clarity an for the for people who will probably never set foot into a laboratory what an incredible yet another incredible discover discovery in development clarity is a and why it helps us understand how the brain an structure yes this is this is a different technology also developed in in my lab here and its a a part of a broader approach that we call hydrogell tissue chemistry and what this is is its building a jell a clear jellow a substance with from within all the cells of a tissue a or evenen animal all at once see your building a effectually building a jell inside all the cells at once now that is a odd thing to do a why do we do it while we do it a to transform the tissue into a more tractable accessible a object and the reason that works is we having built this jell this new infer structure inside the tissue we can then use chenical tricks and we can link the molcules we care about proteenes or are anas which are the things as rigt for they become protines we can link them physically anchor them to this jell which is a scaffold basilly its an interlocking net work of of polimers we can link all these interesting molcules in place lock them ind where they were initially in the tissue in the cell in all the cells and then we can remove very vi corously everything we do not care about that is blocking re light that is blocking our molecules coming in to exchange information with the tissue we can get rid of everything else the lipids the facts we can effectvly use de turgencs toto get them all out and then we can see in all the things that were absorbing our scattering light are gone you cannot of brain that is completely transparent and yet all the interesting molecules are still locked in to place there at the celular and subsolre little and this is hydrogaletissue chamistry the first form we described was called clarity i we use that a quite a bit still but there many variance now that we and others have developed on thi pace i a concept of building this jell than the tissueman anchoring molecules into place literally glass clear brains i've done this i've takein of brain cleare with this method and looked at somebody through it and thog do not want to get it too cluster i do not touch it to your own i but a and you can see direct all the way through it om that is incredible for th it raises an important question which is aagain about the human brain and now somebody who essentually start out in nor anatamy and then got into other things i i always am om bothered by the fact that we actually know very little about the micro structure of the human brain compared to the brains of other organisms and in thinking about understanding the circuitry and the the piano to speak that and how to manipulated in order to com relief suffering one wonders are the structures in these animal brains aand how they behave an active coping passive coping a d d et cetera those models how well they trainslate to the human condition do you think it is fair to say that there are entire regions of the human brain that are not just bigger but that exist only in the brains of humans especially given that we have this speech although i do wonder sometimes if animals were reporting to each other there may do they have little psycheatric sessions with one another noi ii'm always careful to not a assume we do things better ow we certainly understand what we are doing better than we understand what animals are doing and they certainly do things better than than we do that' said we do have amazing wonderful brains and many structures that are very highly developed in our brains that are ar are not nearly developed in mice and and fish for example now im that is said when i look at the big picture what what is the mamalian brain really doing there are things that you would never have thought we could study in in animals and en laboratory emanimals mice a that it turns out you cannot actually i and and i would never draw the lins ay hear something you cannot study in mice or here something that has no parallel and mi i would be very careful before making any any statement that a good example of that as w e've been able to study just in the past year come to an understanding of dissociation and both we had a paper that came out in late twenty twenty both mouse and human work in which we got to the sort of the circuit basis for dissociation would now what is dissociation it lot of people might not have experienced it but it is actually very common more than seventy percent of people who been through trama experienced dissociation it shows up in bordeline personality shows up in pitiast what it is its is a separation of the sense of self from the body ancse you can have some one who it is not as if you are num you are not anestetized you can still that something is happening to the body but you you just do not care because you do not ascribe it to yourself which is very interesting wright that is how interesting as that a sucha report narrative ye almost a in your book you touch on this u an i i will say is the most a precise and meaning ful and eloquent description of what might be consciousness this this narrative toward the self or of the self and where it might reside indissociive conditions u people art our feeling as cond of and absence of emerge between mind and body or is that one we our s riin and as i recall this paper involved a an exploration of cedemie canming was a big part of it yet that is right and cedemin as is another one of those cases where people can experienced dissociation a cedmene or piec p we call these the dissociative a drugs they cause it just a these these other sycatric aa conditions can cause it and we but we were able to manifes this in in mice administering these dissociative agents in mice we could make them still able to detect stimulus but not care that it was was happening all the while we were recording ithe activity of individual cells in the brain to see what was going on what what was happening along with this dissociation and then youse opt ed genetics to see that it mattered to actually provide that pattern of activity and s o that actually causes the dissociation we could do all that in mice a which which was no aat just a who would have thought that that you could study something this in mice and we are able to go back and forth with a human a work because here at in our stanford comprehensive epilepsy centere there are as a lot of what we call sterio e e g recording patience who come in and in the course of normal clinical care they have electras recording in their braing to didentify where the seizure is they can a bhe candidates for removing a little patch of the brain that is causing the seasure this is done for pations wo medications are not helping their seizure disorder and there was a aa patient wou had a dissociative state before every seisure soasas a human being who was really dissociating who could tell us literally as it was happening and we could see this pattern the same pattern that was happening in the mice in the same patch of the brain we could see that happening in the human being at exactly the right time in the same patch of the brain that is homologous across these immense evolutionary distances and we knew that it matter to both in mousing human because in the human we could causen't to happen sand i just ont to underscore the power of not just a that i wont t underscore the power of of opdigenetics and the ability to not just remove ar particular experience or behavior by leisoning or destroying but then to go back and and actually activate the same structure or group of structures and see the emergence it is essentially at these days you hear a lot about gain of function researction the contects of viralmanipulation but gain of function is something that we do in the laboratory and and and a you do in patience to both take away something and put it back and which gives you causality concering and an exactly and withoup progetics we were able to provide i in animals without being on any any cademen or any any dragon we could cause the dissoci state by playing in a precise pattern of activity and not who was a thought you could do that but there is a a combine mousing human paper likewise likewise we have been able to play in a a visual sensations into the brains of of mice a and i observing which sells and e visual part of the brain visual cartexs are naturally responsive to for example vertical bars instead of horizontal bars in the visual world we could see which sells were normally recording on vertical bars and then we could use optogenetics to come and play in activity just those sells to these animals are not viewing anythot doing anything at all and we could active a just the vertical barselves and not only do the animal act as if it was seeing vertical bar behaviorly it was trained to do a particular thing if it vertical bar in i did that just as if it was seeing something visually but everything in the brain that we recording too the internal representation of this external world was naturalistic to it looked the the brain was seeing something visual that wanother that is gain of function too an o playing in providing a complex sensation or percept that was not there before and we can do that in ayou know a cross species i i we have not and of course mice ar social and and they do they do amazing acts of information prossessyng and and i'm i do not a i try not to disparage ore our cousins and too much we certainly have helped the field of narrowsides an medisine i should mention and i know that people have very sensitivities about animal r search but the work that is been carried out in my sas been absolutely on vital and instructional for for treatment of human disease since we talked about a dissociation an dessociative a states rather and cannemeine i'd love your thoughts on psychodelic medicine i a sort of half joke having grown up in this arean northern california when whos much more count or culture than it is now a that many of the things that were hearing about now a at least from my read of the of the history books happened before there was a movement a aimed at taking the very same compounds essentially putting them into patience or people were obviously using them recreationally but putting them into patience and seeing tremendous posive effects but also a tremendous examples of a indue psychiatric illness inother words many people lost their minds as a consequence of over use of psychodocs aprobly lose a few a people out there but i do one a talk about what is the state of these compounds and i realize ats a huge category of compounds but elestyin sivan as i understand trigger activation of particular seritone and receptor mechanisms may or may not lead to more widespread actavation of the brain mor that one would see otherwise but when you look at the clinical and experimental literature but what is your sor f top contour sense of how effect ove these tools are going to be for treating depression and then if we have the time we could talk about troman emdya main some of that order well your your right to highlay both the opportunity and and the peril that is there ha and of course we want to help patients and of course we want to to explore anything that might a be be helpful in but we want to do in a safe in in rigorous way but i i do think we should explore these these have nes these are a agents that alter reality and alter the experience of reality i should say in in relatively precise ways they they do have problems they can be addictid they can cause lasting change that is not desirable a but we have to see these is opportunities we have toafirst of all study in the laboratory and i'm doing this a here i owi we have big a we have safes with many interesting psychodelics that are very carefully regulated we get inspections from the the and any one's hopen to find these la existin outer space ta need a to pon board one of the none of the space ecs and missions in order acses toms o do not try and com behind the not lects exectrytura and and a and and were doing exactly this for were saying this is and crebale opportunet if we could understand how the perception of reality is alter we could be create new kinds of intervention that do not have the risks an an an an the the problems of of causing lasting change or or addiction now that said a even as these medications exist now as there is an impulse to to use them and very small doss anties hand as agunt to a treatments for for ther be verious kinds and i i am also supportive of that if a you non caref in inrigorously of course there is risk but thereis risk with many other kinds of of treatment and i'm not sure that the risks a for these a medications a vastly outway the risks that we normally tolerate an other brancheus of menison why would they work i mean the a let say a that indeed their main effact is to create more a more conictivity at least it in the in the moment between brainarry a the way i think about a very a i think about the two extremes of of my experience anyways a a high degree of trass and focus for whatever reason is going to make create changes in my visual field and changes in the way that i perceived times that en a microslice time i migh in a very contracted view of whatever my experiences res on the opposite extreme in a in a dream or in sleep space an time ar very fluid and i'm esentially relaxed although it might be a very interesting dream int might not be a psychodelic seem to be a a trojectory a not af too far off from the dream state where space in time or essentially not as rigid and there is this element of sinecege of blending of the senses a feeling colors and a hearing a light an thinks of that sort it you hear these reports anyway a why would having that dream experience somehow relieved depression long term isi iswe have any idea why that might be i a we have some ideas and no no deep understanding a one way i i think abouthe psychodelicsis they a increase are willingness to art they increased among us of our brain to accept unlikely a ways of constructing the world unlikely hypotheses as it were as to what is going on the brain in particular quartzects i think is a hypothesis generation and testing machine it is coming up with models about everything it is got all of bits of data coming and and it is making models and upsdating the models and changing them theories hypotheses for what is going on and some of those never reach our conscious mind and thiss something i talk about in projections in the in the book a a quite a bit is many of these are filtered out before they get to our our conscious mind and that is good wewe we think how distracted we be if we were constantly having to valueat all these e know hypotheses about we know what kinds of shapes or ojects or potheses were out there and lon of thisis is handled a a before it gets to consciousness what the psychodelics seem to do is they change the a threshold for us to become aware of these incomplete hypotheses ar wrong hypotheses or or concepts that might be noise a but are just wrong ands are never allowed to get into our or conscious mind now an that that is pretty interesting and it goes wrong and psychiatric disorders i think a in in sgets a frania of some thetimes the paranoid a a delusions that people have are examples of these a for models that escape into the conscious mind and become a accepted as reality and they never should have gotten out there now how could something this in the right way help with something depression patience with depression often are a are stuck they they cannot a alook into the future world of possibilities as effectively thers everything seems hopeless and what does that really mean they they discount the value of their own action they discount the value of the world at giving rise to a future that matters everything seems to run out a river just running out into a desert ind drying up and what these agents may do that increase the the the flow through circuitry if you will the perculation of activity through circuitry may and up doing for depression is increasing the the th escape of some some tendrils of of of process of of forward progression through through the world a that is a concept it is how i think about it there are ways we can make that rigorous we we can indeed identify in the brain by recording we can sea cells that represent steps along a path and look into the future and we can rigorously define these sells and we can see if these are altered on psychodolics and that is one of the reasons that weare a working with these agents in t laboratory to say art isits really the case are these opening up new paths or or representations of paths into the future a emdy am may ta ecstasy is a unique compound in that it leads to big increases in brain levels of dopomean end ceretonean simultaneously and i realize that the nurmotulators dopimen ceretonan often work in concert not alone the way there commonly described in the a you othe more general popular discussions however a it is a unique compound and it is different than the ceretonergei compounds elesty an silisibin and there are now data a still emerging that it might be in enin some cases can be useful for the treatment of trama petioustyan and similar things why why would that work and do youth and a larger question perhaps the more important question is psychidelics emdia may eles to all those compounds there to in my mind thei're too components there is the experience you have while your on them and then theres the effect they have after people are generating variations o these compounds that are non hollucinatory variations but how crucial do you think it is to have let us stay with them do you mad the experience of huge levels of dope me in huge levels of seratone and a typical levels of dopenience eirtone released having tis highly abnormal experience in order to be normal again i think the brain learns from those experiences that is that is the way i see it and and for example people on whoave taken im to in ay they will as you say tol a ther' they be the acute phase of being on tha the the drug and experiencing thethis extreme connectedness with other people for example and then the the drug i weareis off and but the brain learned from that experience and what what people will report is you i'm not not in that state but i saw what was possible you now i saw yet you can do not need to be barriers are at least not as many barriers is as i thought i can connect with more people in in a way that that is helful and i think it is the learning that happens in that state that actually a matters and this as you describe that that sounds a lot what i understand to be the hall marked feature of really good psychoanalysis that the relationship between patient and therapist hopefully evolves to the point where a a these kinds of test can be run within the context of that relationship and then exported yet to other relatio is that exactly and tan that probably amassuming is still the goal of really good psychiatry also it is a part of a intimacy really it should be i when we have time i think all all good psychiatrust tryd to achief at that level of of of connection in learning i try to help patience a creat a knew a new model that is stable that is learned and that can help instruct future behaviour one of the things that i am took from reading your book indition to a learning much science and the future of psychaatry and brain science was a amidst these ver man i make is very tragic cases and and sadness and a lot of the the a the weight that that puts on the clinition on you also that there is a that there is a sential chord of aboptimism that were were headed is a not just a possible but very likely and en better and am it are you an optimist i am and this this is by the way this was of really interesting experience in writing projections because i had a a a duel go i wanted it to be for everybody literally everybody in the world who wants to to to to to read it and yet at the same time i wanted to a stay absolutely rigorously close to the the science that was actually known a when i was speaking about science when speaking about thaha nerbiolity of tho the brain or or psychitra on it to to not have any of my scientific colleagues think o he is he is going too far sing too much and i had these these two gulls which i kept on my mind the entire time and and a lot of this trying to find exactly the right word we talkd about was on this path of staying excruciatingly rigorous in the science and yet letting people see the hope tha the hwer things were have everybody see that we have come a long way we have a long way to go but but the trajectory and athe path is is beautiful and that that that was the the goi i i think i iof course that sounds almost impossible to jointly satisfy those to those two gulls but i i kept then in my mind the wholway thouh an yes i am optimistic i thin i hope that came through in the book but it certainly did and at least from this collague a you you did achieve booth and it is a wonderful it is it is a masterful book really and one that as a scientist and somebody who is a brick a fellow brain explorer a it is all the marks of of rigor and is incredibly interesting and there is a ton of story telling i do not wone to give away too much about it but people should deffling check out the book am are you active on social mediaof people i want to follow you and connect with what you are doing now and and going forward yi have a twitter i that is why i i meanly do i exchange tell people about things that ir are happening i will provide a link toi but that is carrl di sroth as i re gall with ta cank that' t new and you are on twitter and people i will hear the stefphonly a check out the book am there are other people in our community that of course the're going to a a be reaching out on your behalf but it is it is incredible t you cuggle this enormous number of things am perhaps even more in important however is that it is all in service to this larger thing of relieving suffering thank you much for your time to day for the book and the work that went into the book i cannot even imagine for the laboratory work in te devolomet channel obson's clarity ind all the relate tod tecnologies in and for the clinical work you are doing it and for sharing with us well thank you for for all your doing in reaching out i i i aa very impress by it is important and and ait is it is o volyabln't thank you for taking the time in infamiliar gracious words about the book i i hope you enjoy to day's discussion with doctor di seroth as much as i did be sure to check out his new book projections a story of

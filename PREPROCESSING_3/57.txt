america's economic system is increasingly unsustainable heare currently running a thirty three trillian dollar national debt our actural national that including unfunded liabilities runs at least another eighty trillian dollars over the next seventy five years virtually all of that is driven by medicare medicade social security shortfalls this means sooner or later were going to have to ratdically increase taxes cut benefits or in flate our own currency was the only options vailable another threat is the threat of foreign a gression the united states is lucky or surrounded by ocean on one side ocean on the other side mexicans to the south and canadians to the north but that does not mean that we are invulnerable as the world becomes a more and more dangerous place as american power receeds we will feel that everywhere from our pocket book to our military budgion american hageminy has crited a global economy that is paid off for the american consumers in extraordinary ways that can easily be reversed and indicators are that it will be a third threat is the threat of internal moral collapse indeed this threat is the chief factor behind the first two threats as our communities die oure local institutions lose credibility and loyalty and we stop having kids our conomy turns upside down the government grows but the population that has to fund it does not government spending grows but the populatian supporting that government spending does not as the post american future takes hold at home it will similarly take hold abroad with our enemies ready to fill that gap that last threat is the truly frightening one it is the reason for america's polorized politics we use to share basic values particularly at the local level now those values our falling away replaced with hatred and rage largely at christians and white americans take for example james carvill carville is a clintonian political voice in fact he was the lead political stratigist for the plintons he is a person whois retnely urged the democratic party to move away from its most extreme ratical woke positions understanding that they are electoral poison but now his apparently decided that the republican party in general is a threat to the united states that it is what he calls a christian nationalist party now wha doe he mean by that term apparently he does not mean that many republicans preferred to see a revitalized church of the center of american life a proposition which not only is reasonable it is proposition with which i whole heartedly agree as an orthodox ju americans need more church not's not what james carville means he means the republican party is in the words of far left daily costfounder marcos molitzis an american talaban here was carville on bilmarsho on friday night wi garent t li is one of the greatest threts we hav to day could a anin tat wi you are not christian nationalis at absoloy bu iiiis a a iga threat than al critea fitis cartry tha in temtito the speak of hous they got probab in lus two suprine cor jostises maybe more i do not kin yourself in in pipl in pre have no idea whol diskia hio fom what de thratas in this is a fundamental threat two the united state it is a fundamental the don women o constitution dotaitat thet wi jonson himself says what is democrocy but but to os an lium have been lanch now what he saying here is truly nutty in carville's yuse he says two supreme cort justices and the speaker of the house are leading the charge fre christian theocracy by the way that quote from mi johnson it is not a revocation of republicanism meaning a representative democracy it is a revocation of the idea that you can simply through majority vottidolisies but according to jim's carville that is a christian theocracy and again he says there are two supreme cort justices wofre on board with christian theocracy i wonder who those would be maybe amy cony berret clarences thomas ye does not make it clear and says gim's carville theyare a bigger threat then the terrorist group that committed nine eleven and by that he really means than radical is lom in general again this is wild stuff we will gets o more

to get started now jim's carville is not the only democratic voice who sees traditional republicans as the enemy carville says it is all about the christian nationalism that is inherent in the republican party but that is leaving aside the woker side of the party bow be represented by grifter extraordinary abram exkendy it max candy you will recall is the author of how to be anti rasis his entire premise is that if you do not murror the prescriptions of evermaxcendy than you are in fact a rasis and he says that his fellow americans are generally white supremasis i do not think a white people were whine a really recon with how much ther old personi gility i shate by constructions of whiteness an in how much ah that construction of whiteness a provens a white people trum ar conneting to humanity inother words ah recognizing than a wouln you when you recorgnize that you are parton parcel of humanity o were you not oder humaniby he o white people are all emblematic of white supremacy they are over other members of humanity and this according to maxkendy and his ilk this is represented by the republican party in the united states this apparently will be the democratic parties campaign in twenty twenty four republicans are christian theocrats and white supremasis according to them the entire republican party is dominated i desire for white christian fashism or something the response presumably would be an allions of the secularis and people of color not shockingly that is precisely the coalition the democratic party seems to be woing running on abortion and qone quote anti racism the are pushing ford this agend with ugly scare tactics that is why the atlantic magazine is dedicating its first issue of twenty twenty four to suggesting that any vote for donal trump in twenty twenty four is a vote fra fachis regime according to official oboma joc strap sniffer jeffrey golberg editor of that rag quote i encourage you to read all the articles in this special issue carefully though perhaps not i one sitting for reasons of mental hygine ore tume of brilliant writers makes convincingly dis positive case that both trump and trumpism pose an exetential threatsto america and to the ideas that animated un quote yes according to these folks if you vote for trump you have handed away america's future this sort of messaging is also being promoted by republicans experiencing strange new respect that is the respect youreceive when suddenly you start mimicing democratic lines that be people lyis chany whose murroring the duma mongrang of th left here she wus yesterday sat that le trump if he is reelectedit will be the end of the republic what you mean he is told us what he will do people who say well if he is elected it is not that dangerous because we have all these checks and balance as do not fully understand the extent to which the republicans in congress today am have been collopte one of the things that we see happening to day is a sort of a sleep walking in too a dictator ship and the united states sleep walking into dictatorship fahosm white supremacy christian nationalism all the b s words and all of it is going to materialize if donal trump becomes president in twenty twenty four now ironically this sort of alarmism is one of the very biggest route threats to the country countries in which both sides start speaking about how the next selection is the last election about how thei're political opponents if they win mean the end of the country are in serious serious trouble that sort of skermongring gets out vodes because everybody freaks out but it also sets the house on fire in the name of saving the house listen i want jobidon to lose in twenty twenty four i thins a terrible president doing dangerous things that will be incredibly difficult to rectify but the end of america is not in fact nigh in twenty twenty four not unless ironically every one keeps saying it is the closere both sides draw ts the abyss te more each party said the next selection is the last election the more that fantasy draws closer to reality if you have two members of a couple and both of them keep saying then next thing you do i 'm going to divorce you divorce becomes significantly more likely when you do the same thing inside of a country the same thing is true the country comes closer and closer to falling apart when you see your neighbors on the rit as people whar white supremisis christian nationalist fasioss it makes it very difficult to live with those people conversely if you are on the right and you see people who vote demoa crat as such a threat to the nature of the very republic that we are part of that if jobidon wourd when the next selection wl be the last election which by the way no one believe donald trump said the same thing in twenty twenty and then jobidon one and gets what he is running again in twenty twenty four once both sides decide that the next selection is te last election the reality of that threat starts to materialized and that in fact is a true threat to the republic it is a serious serious problem now speaking of the twenty twenty four election jobidon is in fact in dire trouble the current pulling is really really bad for jobidon right now again there is no point during the twenty twelve race in which broglam a eriously trailed mit romney there is no point in the twenty twenty race in which donall trump had a serious lead on jobidon and this particular race donald trump does have a material lead against it jobidon and things are only goin get worse for bid mes tateverything is pretty much baked into the cake with regard to trump this wy your eing the language with regard to trump get more and more heated it is very hard to add new information to the trump system trump is such as that struent since twenty sixteen he is a mudmonster the more mud you thraw on him the more it looks mud and the youtromormotnyou still covered in mud that means that even worke e to be convicted of a crime there be a brief spike in terms of people outraged and then it woul immediately get absorbed into the rest of mudmonster and everything would go away that is not true with jobidon jobidon has been made to look very in competent jobidon has been made to look very bad largely because of his own performants mean in reality jobidon sagging economy has been quite terrible for him especially among the grups he needs to vote for him according to the wallstr journal the pandemic made americans richer across every racial at thecc an income group but not equally home value shut up but fewer opportunities to spend money during lock downs many people paid down debt and boosted savings bet tween twenty nineteen and twenty twenty one the median households not worth increase thirty per cent the wealth of whit an asien households increase the most in total dollars during those years but from many black an ispannic families the boost was not enough to lift them at fully out of debt one an four black households in one and seven his pannic household ad zero wealth at the end of twenty twenty one the manage mant of dent in their debt but those families are lander greater strain now that many of the factors that boosted wealth during the pandemic have revearse nother words the economy has been particularly bad for black and hispanic americans those are exactly the sorts of people the democratic party is counting on what is more the economy is in fact starting to cool inflation is coming down but too is the stock market the stock market is starting to mediate because of course as inflation comes down prices on bonds are going up which means prices on stocks are comparatively less good you'r starring to see the unemployment stabts creeping up that that sort of sweet spot even if we find it its going to mean an increase innon employment generated by bad economic plans from the bide administration and radical over spending by all of that is leading up to te election in which jobidon is going to be eighty some years old obviously not doing weall physically obviously not all their mentally pus hit with more corruption

be shattered hillery have the same exack problem in twenty sixteen the right hated er bert was not just t at the right hadeder it is that the moore she got hit the worst she look the same is true for jobdons to yesterday james comer whose the ead of the house over sy committee he him out wit the announcement that jo bidon did in fact receive payments from e in organization that was run by hunter biden a fun that was essentially funded by foreign sources and belonge to hunter bidon here was it jim's comer explaining risent jo bidon claim there was an absolute wall but tween this official government duties and his familys influents peddling schemes this was a lie present jo bidon claim his family did not receive money from china this was a lie present jo bidon claim being never spoke to his son hunter bidon about the bidens familys shady business teelingsthis was a lie that hunter bidn's legalti and the widehouseis mediallis claim hunters corporat intites never made payments directly to jobidonwe can officially add this lathis talking point to the lis the lie to day the house overside committee is releasing supenan bank reckers that sho hunter bidon's business inity a wosco pc mad direct monthly payments to jo bidon this was not a payment from hunter biden's personal kill but a count for his corporation that receive payments from china and other shady corners of the world on case this is comer's claim and ae claim happens to be true there was money that passed between this particular lawfrm a wasco p c which had receive payments from a chinese statelin company and other foregn companies to jo biden there is some direct monthly payments nowt were they large payments they were not the three payments of one thouson three hndred eghty dollars that curtents and tember october november twenty eighteen were apparently for a twenty eighteen four rapter truck that biden had purchased that hunter bidon was using accordig to an ye nel verified by washington post ferentic analysis hunder biden's atturney aby lowells said quote there chairman comer goes again reheating what his old as new tri'd revive his sham of an in vestigation the truth is that hunters father helped him when he was struggling financially due to his addiction and could not secure credit to financer truck when hunter was able to he paid his father back and took over the payments himself im what that does not actually to bunk the charge the charge that comber is making is that money that was got ton ill gotton gains from foreign sources were used to reimberst jobiton is a matter the size of the payments an sowy matters the matter is that this is now a documented instants of money passing from chinese at linked firms to hunter bidon and then to jo biden it does not have to be that jo bidon receive this as can on top form of en richment just ease he have a wound to his son imen is sun paid back the lone using money from ill gotton gans does not mean that jobitdon has not benefited from ill gotton gains if i give you lone and you go out nyourob a bank andthen yeu payme back that lone i' still benefited i give you th loane you ome money and if you give me he money i have benefited obviously a spokes person for the over si comittey used the fact that the payments came from one of hunter biden's accounts to suggest something more ti farious quote there is now pattern of members of bidon family using their bank accounts that been funded by chinese another fornentities to send money to jobidon based on witness testam ony bide knew and participated in his familiyes influence peddling schemes the chects an payments we have un cover revealed jobidon benefited from them but the washington post sas that this is a in oversold story thei'r mis representing the committee's findings and all the rest now again i do not even understand whathe're trying to to bunk here the thingthat they are trying to bunk his pretty obviously true meaning that joe bidon did receive money from hunter bidon's accounts and those accounts were not in fact getting money from forein sources the sizes of t of the payment does not really manner jobinis suggested he never recive money from any of these relationships first he suggested that hunts are never done anything wrong that turned out to be obviously untrue then he suggested that he had no knowledge of hunterever having done anything wrong and that obviously was untrue then he suggested that he was not involved in any way in his sons business that obviously was untrue then it was that he was not in business with his son that is not clear and then it was that he received no money from his son from ill gotton gains and that obviously is not true in fact corensjon pierre was asked yesterday world's worth pressecretary about thes payments and does she simply ended the press conference wyes seele te the presiden and i son whatever as i geer aete rbely al se a a r aqeree baeere han ver ae won ter iiis o wa he see e r ha e eside i e preden ee hamen and wy ethe be ea ra man eeer a her wore es a wallseratan sees ato be e clear with you ii have not thin tat reportt i would have to refur to my collegues over at the wen house counsils office on that particcular question ae igt every one see some of the in boton or on whencsthey thinkerin catchlater by again none of this is going to benefit jobidon his record on the economy is week his personal foibles are obvious to every one and the more the media keep trying to talk past them the more everybody notices them there is a reason that jobidon is not contannd up to bating donald trump in the selection cycele and it is because he actually cannot be on the same stage as donal trump donald trump is a very alives havin seven year old and jobidon is a very not alive eighty one year old at this point in time or will be by the time the election happens in one second we will get to jobidon's foreign policy record finally the perfect gift for somebody

were baby to get started saving lives to dat commenwil the bin ministration forign policy right now there are several issues on forign policy that are threatening to bides reelect efforts one of them is obviously u crane this was the great moral war that jobidon got behind very early on and it was an immoral for the united states to support you crane in proventing russia from taking over the entire country all the isolation is out there horelike well you crane provoked russia into it let us as som for a second that youre totally rights that mean that russia now gets to completely injest you crane is that the actual solution as that russia ets to injess tou crane and put itself on the borders of nado by the way would that be a smart solution or does it make sense that you provide enough aid for you cranet actually be able to repel that invasion and then recognized wat the realities are on the ground which the russia has significant build up in donbas in crimea and that short of going to direct war with russia which nobody wants the final lines of demarcation were pretty obvious by april mad june of twenty twenty two and yet jobide never made clear what exactly his goals were in ou crane instead they just kept saying things as long as it takes whatever the ucranians want well the problem is that the ucranians had never even articulated a goal other than the complete liberation of don bas and crimea nd then the united states was not willing to provide the weapon ry tat would actually be necessarily the have sixteens that e necessary in order to actually achieve ir superiority for example in those particular regions they have not been given be ammun ammunition and armaments necessary t actually make that sort of thing effective unto hundreds of thousands of people have been dying on both sides of this particular war in pursuit of moving a line that has not moved this is turned into world were one trench warfare essentially and yet the white house is not proclaiming that if this thing turns into a stale maye which are already is then obviously that will be because of some short coming in funding thot's pretty obvious all long what shoul hav happened here and recessenger spelled it out again last year it was an un popular point of view but happen to be correct ye basidly said that the united states was going to halfe to make clear to the ucranians what the solution was namely we will provide you enough aid that you gites are not invet invaded again an tht can defend yourselves against future invasion we will providou some sert of defence guaranty also you are probly not can end and ternado because if you an ternado than that is obviously going to project a gression against the russians you are not going to be formally admitted to the eu at least not right now and also russia is going to basidly maintain the lines that they gained under president obama by the way in twenty fourteen when they invated russia when the invaded crimia and the donbas and then the united states was goig to hve to make that side deal of pootent and go to zolenski and the ucranians in basically cramatdown on them in tillisen were the one for sining the checks and that loy the stealscan go why not because that is bad for you crane or zolensky but because it is good for you crane or zolensky because olensky at this point cannot go back to his own people and tell them i'm not taking dohnbass i'm not taking crimea he obviously has every interest insaying that he is going to take both of those things but it is not really a plausible solution and instead because the bid administrations did not have the stones to simply go and negotiate that deal and then give zolensky the ability to rip on bidon and saylason i wanted more but bidin force it on me because bidon was not willing to take that hit instead bidins gon t take the entire hit which is going to be a consistent feeling off stale mate with no offram anywhere in here and he is gointo be one pays the political price for that for his part bidon and the white house theyre now trying to projact all responsibility for that stalemate not on their own failure to spell out a strategy in the first place or a recognize reality on the ground when a materialized mee again the united states tried to bride the armament's material necessary for a major wintr offensive from you craned agains russiand e jus never broke through in any serious way instead they are now trying to project their own failures on to congress for not wanting to extend to eight now will congress end up exstending it yes congress lend up extending aid to the extent necessary tat you crane will not fall to the russians that is a thing that the united states will do there is a large support even in republican sircles for at least that much even republicans do not want a see keeve fall to the russians at least the vast majority of them but what the white house now sayng is that unless you continue to sort of grant blank tracks as the white house uses in its discretion then you are somehow helping pootent national secure adviser jake sellven e'n reprusser yesterday in which you points it out that you crane would run out of resources by the end of the year on you crane as you ball seen earlier to day oa medirectorsia on the young sent to letter to can ressiona leader is wich coren wis just referencing explaining that without congressional action the administration will run out of re sourceis by the end of the year to procure more wes an equipment for you crane and to provide equipment fom youess military stocks without in packting our own military readiness speaker o the house johnson responded he said the bide administration has faild to substantively dress any of my conference is legitimate concerns about the lack of a clear strategy in you crane a patht resolving the conflict or plan for adequately insuring accountability for aid provided by american tax payers house republicans have resolved that any national security supplemental package must begin with our on border and again there will be some sort of package yeol that ands upsigned here mainly because jobidon and the democrats keep veetoing each independent part of this bill but the white house instead of spelling out what their actual plan here is instead theyare suggesting that if you do not support the kind of funding they want you are helping out pooten which again is not going to be a particularly strong argument you tran manym i believe that any member of congress ho is not support funding or you crane is voting for an outcome that will make it easier forprudent to er vail that is a vot a g ents supporting you crane is a to to improve pruden ii is iion that is just thin tini spapable reality that is not'speaking to some one t to motive why they chose to go togains ti that is just speaking o the outcome of ther cot well i mean it happens to be true that if you crane were to collapse to the russians of course that helps glanrpooten the question is how d you comes to an agreement on what exactly the united state should be doing here the nour times reports that the democratic led senat is preparing o vo wensdand more than sixty one billion dollars and you crane focus to sistence as part of one hundred and six billion dollar national security package there ware also fund israel's war effort in gaza but apparently the white house is now trying to pressure geope waw makers to abandon border security concerns the republicans are ar art aiming for some sort of bor security package attach twall this an democrats ar saing no now who is against the aid again if this a battle of poison pills thats pre significant poison pilliar throwing in there republicans are saying habitson border security and democrasr sang no why would you say no and by the way it is not as though this administration is laid forth a cohesive strategy with regard to you crane the washington post admits as much quote mis calculations divisions marked offensive plannine by us you crane apparently a meeting in brusseles les than two weks into the campaign illustrates how a counter offensiv born and optimism has failed to deliver its expected punch generating friction an second guessing between washington and keeve and raising deeper questions that you crane tobility to retake decisive amounts of territory as winter approaches and the front lines freez in a plase you crane's most senior military officials acknowledge the war has reached a stale made this examination of the lead ups you cranes count our offensive his based on interviews with more than thirty senior officials from ou crane the united states and european a nations and it chos that there is a gap between what the us and u crane thought were actually possible for example youus military officials were confient a mecanized frontal attack on russian lines was feasible wit the troops aed weapons you crane had the simulations concluded that keeves forces inthe best case could reach the sea of asov and cut off frussing troops in the south in sixty to ninety days but apparently that never happened ou cranians did not want to do that there is a gap in strteco planning between the united states an u rane there is no offram and then the idea is that unless you give the funning the white house is sort of asking for that you are anti u crane havout you spell out a plan g but again jobidna's box himself in here because he has spelled there is no offram what looks a victory for twenty twenty four for you crane absolutely unclear at this point meanwhile victory is well within grasp for america's ally israel against comoss and meanwhile the the white house is he sort of futsing around over there hen it comes you cran elik gong ho all in let us do this thing unstopable aid no plan unstopable aid no victory no uns keep that money pouring in er you love pooten and then on the israel issue israel ashally has the military capacity to finish off comss israel has the military capacity to make the gaza strip at the very least quyessen with regard to anti terrorism and this is where the united states is putting it to anti focus this is where they'r ike denno got a stop short why the gap why the gap a man it comes from a fundamental under misunderstanding of for polici is where the gap comes from russha is a new clear armed heavily weaponized large power theyre dug in when it comes to don bass and the crimea there is there is no rasional for any sort of lochec that you crane is going to take both those areas that is at absolutely clear the situation on the ground is the situation theground meanwhile the reason t the bid dministration tkeeps fussing around with regard to the middleleast is because theyre still under the john carry misimpression that palistinians are centrael to middle east piece which is a lie it was debunt completely by the abrahamicords in fact it is specifically because that notion was exploded by the abrahamicord to end by the burgeoning relationship toin israel and saliurabia that commoss tried to throw a wrench into the gears with thei're a tap on october seven what is the bidemnistration doing there immediately doing commosses work by calling for concessions from israel to the palistinians and telling israel to stop short what is the rasional for that other than a complete dunderheaded foreign policy thow probem for bidan is it is gont be pretty obvios that if you stop israel from winning an cohice of military victory in the gos o trip thats sing to look grat either i understand i's trying to pleace is radical base in democrats are filled with radicals who hte israel i get it but that singon look a a victory to theamerican people who are going to punish america theye can punish whatever american regime is in place whatever administrations in place for military losses americans do not lost wars their not a big fan and far jobidon iss presiding over lost war an afcannistan hofs presiding over a stalemate that he refuses to declara stalemate in you crane and he is presiding over what could be a clear military victory for israel but is being hamstrong by the american by the american state de partment and radicals in the democratic party will get to that momentarily first the holidays not only allow us to spend time with family

israel completely destroying hommoss a despised terroroust organization labeled thas such by pretty much every western power commass is here that they'r absolutely horrific in fact every day brings news of more of their atrosities including the fact that they apparently drug the hostages they were returning to israel that with rufies they literally rufy them s they would look as though they were happier or calmer when they were released from hostage captivity back to the israelies in fact the state department yesterday announced that commoss is not turning over a bunch of young women whaare still hostages tbecause they do not want those young women talking about what they did to them one of the reasons they do not want o turn women over that they bey holl then hostors and the reason iss postol apart is they don' what they ose women to be oln talk about what happen than them during their time and cossidy now one of the thing that is been happening inside the administration is a bit of a gap between the state department which is shockingly shockingly pro israel in many of these way and the pentagon which is shockingly pro israel elistrohn curby is and then some of the hierops the the people at the national security administration for example and uss ay sullivan wits asked about wycomass with not turning over these women andhe said were not in speculate which is nnow completely at odds with what the say department s pokes person just said there bian speculate on that only to say that they have not done it and i onlyto say were greatly concerned about that i i'm i can speculat is to ther reason againt oneof the things that the administration has been doing is wafling and wavering which the mazing caus when it can when t came tu crane there is no waffling no wavering kno nothing despite no actual and of conflict that that was projected or expected or articulated here is pretty obvious what the goal is and theadministrationis working to obviscate that coll not only that the administration is working really hard not to tick off it is progressive left wing base on thi tissue in te somehow mistaken belief that in order to win over it is left win and there and thus win the presidency thay to throw israel under the bus which of course its ridiculous because by polling data most americans are much more support of israel than for example come oss theadministration play to the other win said comms has to go commass is evil comas committed mass rape commas committe mass murder israel has to going to do it it has to do and were in of worry about what happens on the other end afterward this is a moral fight if the administration were to say something that in the same way that they say itabout you cran that is a victory israel would actually win that is what is truly amazing about this meanwhile of oreencon piare yesterdations ask about fror millogiopole who is that of the congressional progressive coucis youre call yesterday we played a clip of her explaining that there need to be balance with regard to how people talks about rape by homoss that shure comoss was raping people but they have to be balanced and how they talk about that as to establish moral equivalence between israel an commass here is corrncon pur refusing to condemn giapoll on this sssatsgat ga aation e ben very very clear i ear little it rom i'm take someoment about this i i cand only speak her for the president that is who i can speak for and we have been clear wea homattet is absolutely reprehensible and wull stop bergan i continue to be clear about that and we think about in a rape and the yousi rape aske beused as as a weapon that is also reprehensible but why exactly will not they condemn fromilacioppole or for that men arichen to leeve or for that manter ilhan omar and the answer s because they are afraiht of the'r left wing base left toing basis still governing this administration at least at the margins and and that lefton basis crazio kake briona joy gray who is kind of a crazy person she is the former national pressecretary for burneystanders un surprising she treated this out quote believe all women she is talking about the rape of his raily women believe all women was always an obsurt overeace women should be heard clam should be investigated but evience is required the samdmnistre of the allegations out of israel but also this is not to believe women cenaria because no female victims have offered testimony first of all i'mt they were shot in the head e knows not around to a explain to about their rate the people who are dead cause they were shot in the head or kidnapt those people not around to talk about it but the're many contemporaneous accounts witness testimony medical reports but dosn't matter does not matter because again the idea from the radical left is to reestablish this moral equivalence and the byd administration for some reason keeps on falling fort over and over it is in the democratic party and it certainly in the media burney standers yesterday did what he does best establish that moral equivalenc he suggested that the nitsing yow who government is being a moral that yoef t understand the coted languager here is bid of a cot when people on lotsay the nitting now h government theyare ignoring the fact that there is a unity government in israel right now yes benjramin in to now hoas the prime minister he is part of a war cabinet he can be overruled by that ware camet he is just a vote in that war cabinet then he gonts is a member of the opposition party he is the person many democrates ould to see leading the country right now in israel and he is part fthy government that is a unity government that is why burney keeps saying in it is nyaho because there is this bazar notion on the left that nitting owt whorn out there somehow tha to be going to fromtly oht it would not who would be going exactly the same or in some in some ways probably harsher niting ow who tends to ben incrementalist on a lot of this sort of tuff gante and gallant not particularly clear that is the case anyway there as burney yesterday doing his routine ta cime when over two hundred and fifty people have been killed in the west bank o the co co bo goz talking about the west pank since told the some an wor tan a thousand palis tios have been driven al all they land in the wesst fant tho in the midst of all o that i do not beli we should be appropriating open ten gullian galls for the right thing excrem tes net in ya who goverment to continue it is corrent nilitaryopot what the that in ya who govermen is doing is i marl it is in violation up intonational law and the united thates should not be complesit in those actions lovin him bat international law from communist fellow travelers its realit is really a a lot of fun and when he talks about what is going on inthe westbank he is ignoring the fact that the're eit enough terrorists in the westbank in fact it was the amount of terrors m i the west bank that drove israel to prior to october seventh move many of its forces from the gaza envelope around gaza ind lead up to october seventh into juday and smaria to tryind fight terrorist in places lagtionen as far as t accusation that pallsingins are being driven off ther land onmass at no the answer there is the vhery bunch of illegal palistinian settlements that are in fact pen of corrugated iron shacks in many of these cases and those are being dismantoled by the is really military in many cases it is amazing build an extrom bedroom in a frot which a really nice city in the west bank an his jewish city in th westbank then this means or violating international law if ho ever you prob up a corrugated iron shaft injudea and sumaria and you call it historic palistonian territory and then the idea of comes into smantals it than this is somehow dispossession that is the way all o this works in any case this narrative is being driven by the media as well the y narrative that israel is engaging in vasts human right fiolation despite the fact that theyare engaging in more strenuous attempts to avoids villain casualties than any army in modern history by the way worth noting at this point that all the casuals i casualty stafts thetare being repeated adnausan by the press are being garnard by the gossa ministry of health namely commoss and they are lying about all of those this has ben pointed out by an imby an account hale isenberg fifty five these bord member of honest reporting and a he points out that the women an children numbers from the gossim ministry of halth are grosly in flated and that is perfectly obvious for example uan ocha publisheis a daily flash up tates ins october eighth insihtes i detailed gosic casualty figures provided by commas itis immediately obvious thet commoss is not report any combatant deaths the numbers amazingly seem to indicate that idea of bomsand bullets dist proportionalely hit women children in the elderly buy the numbers are fate it first becomes apparent on october nineteenth reporting for commos reports three thousand seven hundred eghty five deaths first is three thousand for hunred seventy eight the prior day orn idition of three hundred seven deaths but children magically moved up from eight hundred fifty three dad to one thousand five hundred and twenty four dead plus six seventy one october eighteenth reporting deths were twenty five per cent kids the next daytrum to forty per cent kids no explanation is given and this sort of idiocy marks evere single edition of casualties iagain it took israel weeks and weeks two determine who is eaten dad in kfar oza i know people who attended funerals literally yesterdad for people who are kiled on october seven and by the wander jewish law one somebody is dagers pill sobarry them the next day that is how long te took israel a highly a highly technical technicratic government to figure out how many people have died meanwhile commosgus throwing out one million begilian child poets being killed in gosan a r takin that at face value and tat of course is leading members the media to repeat that sort of nonsense will

homas over and over and over again jeg taper an sionan who has been batter than many of the san in reporters he it is paratically has these interviews were he just a silly things he had an interview with margragav who is a who is a spoke person for these realy government an which he points out that a bunch of members of a family of a sean and producer hade been killed in gaza and reguof points out that they ware weeks and monds of israel telling people to get out of the gosa strip a d millions of people did an tapper then says welwe cannot blame people who who did not wi mean you certainly can point out that they had warning and they did not get out of a warsown when millions of people literally did over a million people moved here is this exchange it is very hard to believe that especially on a day when one of our producs ers lost nine members of his family nine members of his family who were not members of komas not members of the pous tillion is lonto hot not members of any group just nine people tust trying to live their lives postome i extend my sorro to him and my sympathies but if i saw you re put correctly an and please correct me if i sasthing mong that happened in northern gaza an gasa city were a month ago we the aske tol the cibilians to leave and most of them did if there was one milion to hundred thousand people they thet was on couple of tens of thousands lift and what has to ask yes they had wa ampled opportunityty leve hem unidenknow what happened un under the specific circumstances i know this deadly com bat at going on now in the north still between these idea and and and and i mus terus yes and we donway see anyone put up in the crespa but why did not they hd the advice anele anthmaerea i cannot blame them whe there is now dony lame but you cannot this fighting in the south now n where where are i ean i've been asking the since october seventh where i people suppose to go they did go they did go a million of them moved they are suppose to go to the areas that israel tells them to go to as at mean perfect securemeans of halvla better secure than staying where israel tellng you not to be again t but see an end's idea which is that somehow if israel gives weeks of warning than people do not move that somehow what what exactly was isrel supposed to do i'm just wondering every seems to think that isral has a magic julas or it to mazing all the same people were pistoff and marjory tail agreean with their silly jewish space laterstoff seem to think the jews actually have a spacelavs ere in israel nd they can use their magic space lazsery just at the bagguis while leaving all of the normees sort of untouch that is not the way war works and when you go out of your way to tell people to we for weeks on and and then they do not it is not that it is quonquat their fault it is that they are in a dangerous area they have been told to leave abesy ne is doing the same sort of moral equivalenc nonsenseo abse nes at a full report on the supposed ma treatment of palistinian quotiqual detines now these detanes our people who tried to commit acts of terror against his railies and the idea here is that israel is just hostages o no it is not my concern is that theis raili authorities are not treating palistinian choldren toldi do not think that anin bydy conclaim n that locking o large numbers of tortran fo long periods of time is either just or helpfl beyond that the low is also different for palistinians and is realiis palistinians living in the wess bank artried in military ourtz is really settler is legally living there artrie an civil court in israily child in a settlement next to a palistinian village throws a stone that child is tried under the israily system a palistinian child in the vilit next store who throws the same stone its subject to a military court system pretrild attention is the norm well hold up a second that is because the palistinians are living under the palistinian aufcarty thera foreign population in terms of actual governments that is saying that when a that when a crime is committed againstin american soldier over seas that person is tried in military court ispose to an american civocort well yes that is yes come t again the whole gul here is to tryin and generate some sort of moral equivalencin israel and its enemies here and this is this is the wholestik is the hosik here is the bottom line for fort jobide the entire confused moral line taken by jobidan is likely to result in no victory for jobide because even if israel gets done what it needs to do in the face of american pressiar the by dministration is now making in impossible for t to claim any sort of victory in all of this speaking of which victory in the generalized the aria seems to be difficult to come by for a uuss ad ministration tht its focus on basically appeasing aron according to politico in ours long firefight involving uus commercial vessels in the red see this weeken has left summit uus officials frostrated by what they see as the bide administrations deliberate down plang of a major threats to american forces a uus navy worships scramble to respond to multiple distresscalls on sunday as houthy rebels in yeman launchd missiles and drones against three separate cmmercial vehicles thou s us carny fired back taken down three unmanned aerial systems four other officials with knowledge of the discussion sendin interviews youus naval forces are clearly under thret in the red see and the persian gulf one deo the officials had quote if our ships see something is coming near them or toward them they are going to assess it as a threaten shout it down ou be hard press to find another time that uu ships have ben this challenged in the region and yet again you us officials are down planness and pretending that it is not a ron or is not part of a broader effort against uus forces some deo de officials have sed explicitly the increas in attacks on commercial shipping is an escalation thou us has retaliated against dozens of attacks by ronian proxies in rock or syria in recent weeks including striking facilities used by the militons in both of those countries in rock and syria but t the united states is not doing is striking any targets inside aron where this is coming from ow lemmers point out if if donal trumper presient right now there would ave ben missil flying into a ronorad not because donall trumped want to provoke some sort of broader worthoron but because the threat to the aronians would be clear stop this right now stop it right now and hit happen yeuron inds would stop coes you knowt they do not actually want to be at war with the united state o america that is something a ron seriously does not want but the power of american deterrins is basically gone at this point according to political us officials are frustrated by the bie administrations response to the attacks the power of the turrents is going away former national securety official said the bide administration you to do more to deter the hoothies from attacking ships in the red sa and other aron back groups from launching additional attacks on yus forces in a rock and seria retired vice admiral john miller former commander of us fif fleet said were not taking the seriously he is tht we are not toturning anybody right now oes that sound a

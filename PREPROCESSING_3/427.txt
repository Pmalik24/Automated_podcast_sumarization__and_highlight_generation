welcome to the hubermanlasciencescience ac tori maydru hubermen and om a professor of nerbiology and opthemology at pstamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor paulconty doctor conty is a psychiatrist who did his training at stampord school of medicine and then went on to be chief resident at harvard medical school he now runs the pacific premear group which is a collection of psychitris and therapist focussing on solving complex human problems including trama a diction personality and psychiatric disorders to day we discuss trama in detail and the therapeutic process in detail for instance we discuss what is trama how do if you have trama doctor conti shares with us for instance that not every experience that we think his tramatic is necessarily tramatic and yet many people might have trama without even realizing it we also talk about the therapeutic process generally for instance how to picatherapist how to best approach and go through therapy and how to evaluate whether not therapy and your relationship to the therapist is working or not we also talk about self therapies because we acknowledge that not everyone has access to or can afford therapy and we talk about drug therapies for instance antidepressens antypsycotics we talk about alcohol canabis cenemine and the psychadelics including sylisiban elest and we talk about the clinical use of m dima and what the future of that looks the reason for bringing doctor conty on to this podcast is because i see him as the person who has the greatest and most holistic view of therapy trama drug therapies talctherapies and how self therapy and work with others can be integrated for both healing and growing from difficult circumstances doctor conty is also the author of an exceptional book entitled trama the invisible epidemic how trama works and how we can heal from it that book describes trama and its many features and many tools some of which we discuss on the podcast to day whether or not you have trama or not by the end of today's episode you will have a much deeper understanding about what trama is in fact i'm confident that you will gain inside into whether or not you have trama or not whether not people close to you have trama or not and the various pas to recovering and indeed growing from trama that we can all take as you will soon learn doctor conty is an exceptional communicator and has a unique window into the trama and therapeutic process that i know that all of us can benefit from before we begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separateform my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire in effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that

looking forward to this and ereceived a ton of questions about trama about therapy about how to asess where one is in their own ark of problems and addressing themilial issues and relationship issues and forth we ou just start off very base if you just get everyone oriented how should we define troama we all have hard experiences some of them we migt ruminate on more than others but what is trom to make the definition relevant i think we have to look at trama as not o anything negative that happens to us but something that overwhelms our coping skills and then leaves us different as we move forward it changes the way that our brains function and then that change is evident in us as we move forward through life how do we know if we have trama or not i've heard before everyone has trama frence as i've heard that if we are a child or when we are a child and we request love from apparent or attention from a parent if they dismiss us that that is a michro trama is that overstating or unfair to the real issue of trama do we all have trama what or michero tramas what or mack or tramas i think tramais that we might categorizes disappointment rieter or things that are our negative but not deeply impactful i think is is not is not a helpful definition i think the helpful definition is something that rises to the mnagnitude of really changing us and something that we can see both in how we behave we can see it in mood anxiety behavior slee physical health we we can identify it and we can also see it in brain changes ththe fact that we becomes a more hyper vigilant driht more vigilant than we can see that different parts of the brain or more active that definition that definition captures how trma if it rises to a certain level what we would say trama that makes a post trama cindra right leaves us different i think is the helpful definition of trama because it is a clinical definition right it is changes in us as people and we can we can map those changes to identifiable shifts in our brain function how do we know if we have been changed by something im i can think back to thildhood events where some kid on the play ground or in the class rom said something i did not something negative about me i think most people can do that we have a great memory for the kid that said something awful or the parent or teacher that said something awful that really felt it hurt us or at least it stucked with us clearly aone's brain my brain in this example has been changed by the that event such that i remember it but how do we know if something has actually changed the way that we are because course we do not know how we would be otherwise that is that is difficult it it is duable but it is difficult because the response if the trama rises to the level of changing our brains and and i do not disme lic with a new memory rigt we can have memories of something that was negative it and in that sense it changes the brain becaus now there something we can call to mind but it does not change the functioning of the brain if if t rama rises to the level of changing the functioning of our brains thand there is almost always a reflex of guilt and shame around the trama that can lead us and often leads us to bery riht to avoid it right to to feel that now there is something negative inside of me and it is feels shameful or it feels no one else would acceptedt iso what happens as people tend to avoid looking at the change in them which is exactly the opposite of what needs to be done rigt the idea of in a viral pandamic revery when i stay away from one another and isolate right but but with the trma epidamic we need we need to communicate with other people we need to communicate and put words to what is gone on inside of us and and very often a person knows i meand i've done much clinical work over about twenty years that that has focused ontrama and a lot of the times the person knows right but they are not admitting to themselves because hey're afraid of it ey they do not know what to do but if they start talking thand the little talk about the event or the situation could be something acute or could be something chronic that really has been harmful to them and then they feel different afterwards ik oh after that i started thinking differently feeling differently but that does not always happen sometimes it is a process of exploration wenathrough dialogue wright whethe whether it is written or whether it is spoken of of the person exploring the changes inside of themselves may be changes to their self talk inside changes to their thoughts about the world and whether they can navigate safely and readily in it and you anchers s i talk about this the example all use at times as the example of my own life where you knowin i was much younger in my early twenties my younger brother took his life by suicide and the yor the response of guilt and shame nd and hiding all of it inside of me was was it is as very dramatic but but i was not acknowledging it right cause i did not know what to do about it and i felt guilty and i felt responsible and i felt ashamed there was an avoidance inside of me and then i was not saying to myself a before this ak you thought that you could be effective and you could make your way in the world and if you were a good person and you worked hard you could make a difference right and then afterwards i thought i cannot get any where the r the worlds against me and i felt all my my options are all gon and as a twenty for years old right it i did not see that the change was in me but i was taken care of myself poorly who is enough going on that was unhealthy that i could not avoid the realization t i'm different now and in these ways that are automatic my reflex to can i make my way in the world can i have a good life can i be happy my reflexes that were all differenc and they were coming through the lends of i and anxiety heightened vigilance a sense of guilt a sense of shame iand a sense of none belonging in the world and and was ultimately good and helpful people around me and my own realization and ha things are not going well right that led me to then get some help and to be able to talk about it and realize ol my gotic any to face these things that are going on inside of me from a psychoanalytic psychological and may beven a nur science perspective two questions why do you think that when we experience trama these things that we call guilt and shame surface everythng you are telling me is that in the and that is not adaptive why would we be built that way that is the first question and then the second question is yu now how should we conceptinalize you on guilt and shame i think a we hear guilt we hear shame how shal we think about it i'man that those emotions must exist in us for some reason u but in this case it seems they they do not serve us well maybe it in that order or in reverse order youand what at what is guilt really what is shame really and why is it that we seem to be reflectively wired to feel guilty and feel ashamed when that is exact opposite of what we need to do in the case of trama right rightni think these are great questions and and ow do not think anyone knows the answers for sure but my read of all that is that there is something adaptive that is happened in us through evolution that now becomes maladaptive in the way we live in the modern world right f you think of throughmost of human development an people were not living that long right the idea was to survive and reproduce tramatic things that happened to us it would make sense for them to stay with us right if you ate a new food and got really really sick thak you better remember that right if you see some one from the group of people a couple miles away right and one of those people attacks you rights at you better remember that the tramatic things that our sove emblazoned in our brain are built to last right things that are positive will generate some motion inside of us but things that are profoundly negative are much more likely to say with us and i think that that was adaptive right when all of that was about survival right and i think the same thing is true with wuld say shame right i think heret make sense thatto to talk a little been actiom interested if you your thoughts about this right that that the lympic system right that the system often is called the emotion system right in our in our brains has a of course varying function right and one aspect is affect right affect is aroused in us w ch which thic the the meaning then is it is created in us without our choice right if if we are walking down the road and some one jumps in tront of us or pushes us right thand there is a response of fear or anger right heartstarts beating faster more blood to the muscles and we we are getting ready to to fight right or or run right in then we become aware of it right the aroused affect in us is also about survival and it has a very deep impact upon us and shame is an aroused affect mat it it can be raised in us without our choice and it is very powerful which if you think about that is an extremely strong toturrent right if you had in imagine a a tribe r group of people right that are sheltered together and in a some one eat's half the food at night thing right and that there is a very negative response right in that person feels shame his shame is powerful to to control behavior rigt the way that tromic can change our brains and and stay with us in way this as be more vigilant look at the world in a different way act more defensively right and and how that links to shame and to guilts and thin guilt in in but guilt becomes what gets called feeling technically where we relate the aroused afect to ourselves right shame the aroused affect and guilt the next step right when we when the shame gets related to self are such profound behaveral interventions and and deterrence rigt that you can see i think how evolutionarily and of all make sense if were fighting for survival known we are an elder statesman if we make it to twenty right this make sense but it does it make sense in a world where we live much longer right we navigate in all sorts of different ways and there is much coming at us that can be tromatizing we you think about the news and me how many times of ight written a prescription for some one is ays kno more news right we e afte written theor yes ere yes were glance at the news look at the news for news an thing going on i need to know right but but what are people doing is looking at it their cloocking in their cloking enters an there is a sense of being inthralled in a very frightening way with the horrors that are in front of us and and it shows out yes tromic and come through acute things that happen to us tromic can come through chronic things chronic denegration whether it is based upon socio economic stat is immigrant emigrations tatus om a race religion secuality gender identity that the these chronic tromas right of being denegrated by the society round us retreated as less than can change the brain but vicarrious experience is can too right and we know this is not theoretical we know that the changes in the brain can come from vicar ious experiences too which is why people were glued to the news than feeling all my goodness i what is happening of tha the mothers in the ucrane who in a lost babies in the warn their things that are terrifying that if we spend much time with that it has a similar effects oure brains are built to change from trama but not in the way we experienced trama and not in the way that we live life in terms of the nature of living life in the duration of life in the modern world with these dramas that happened to us are often bad for us because they they change how our brain is sunctioning and then are entire orant orientation till the world is different and that could be for iu years and years and decades and decades it brings much misery and suffering and at times it brings death f feeting but a hundred thousand overdoses deaths in this country in a year a hundred thousand where is a is much of that arising froms at person whose treated addiction very intensively over many years i think the whil i feel sure that the majority of adiction that i see and treat o rise is ultimately the roots of it are in trama and are in trying to soothe something that stuck inside that the prison is t letting outside because of the guilt an shame but is running round in their head and tormented by it and and now there is a pole for for these drugs are somethinges medicines to soothe they or the the ol opiats that were given after a minor surgery right ar ar t ocae yet they help the pain for the minor surgery but what the really helping is the pain inside right but that very quickly turns into addiction danger risk when we see that over and over again and and not in not in a theoretical way i see that in people who have been in my practice with addiction thearising from trama who have subsequently died it soit have rit large in our existence in the modern world incredible to me that this is the way works a and what what i mean by that is this idea that i've heard about before i think it was a froidian concept up a repetition compulsionous that am this this is what boggles my mind as i'm hearing this something happens to us or we observe something tramatic and instead of acknowledging that and trying to distance from it there seems to be a reflect of chame an gilt in many cases and stuffing it away and then a repetition of behaviours to continue to try and to stuff it away at's o trying to pack i do not know recently i was packing a home and trying to get thaa sleeping bag back into the bag its it siply have always on a mushrmount the top this kind of thing it takes a lot of on going effort and at the same time that if this thing really exists this repetition compulsion people will return over and over again to the kinds of sonarios or at least the kinds of emotional states that look just the trama er resemble it in some way the the question i have for you is is the repetition compulsion a real thing and why wuld we be wired that way my understanding of this concept of the repetition compulsion is that we all want to solve our tramas and it allows us to put ourselves into micro or again mackr versions of that over and over again we get to run the experiment again and again in i ttempt to solve it right in the case of taking a drug that it is clearer a certain drugs opyods its clear how that would not allow us to deal with it right it is just masking it at the emotional state but why is it for instance that somebody who experiences secual trama then places themselves in to circumstances of more sexual trama whyis it is somebody who is in abusive relationship goes on to have a second and third or yeworth verbally or physically abusive relationship that mean on the face of yutiscope that makes no sense and yet we see this over and over and over again yes the first thing i oid say that the the validity of the repetition compulsion caugt concept y is is a strong yes yet yes we see that over and over its not necessarily in every one ba boy it is in a lot of people who have suffered trama and and i think there is a very good reason on the face on the surface of it is thay it makes no sense but then if we think how does the bhow does our brains actually function right we we are it trained at least in western society i think to think of ourselves as logical creatures right that oh we are logical and ultimately everything in us can just boiled down to logic and if we think about it enough wee can we can understand how to make the right decisions we just completely not true right that th the lymbic system writ the emotion system to speak inside of us always trumps logic right yeu think about does it ever make sense to run into a burning building mean logic says now right but if some one you love is in the burning building you people run right in right because the lymbi system says yes when logic and emotion come head to head emotion wins all the time if emotion is powerful enough it will always win and the lymbic system is important and the lymbic system does not care about the clock or the calendar right and that is the answer and also say why t to the repetition compulsions o the lymbic system does it know oh it is now it is to day it is may it is two thousand twenty tojust does not care at all right how i would relate that to the repetition compulsion is is whtwhen people are repeating what they are trying to do is to make things right right with the idea that if we can repeat the situation and make it right it will fix everything right which makes perfect sense if if we think w ll where is that concept coming from right it is coming from the emotional part of the brain that wants relief from suffering of the trama and does not understand the clock or the calender if i can solve something now i will also solve something in the past right which is why i cannot tee a hell many times that sat with someone es it were starting to do therapy an a person will say grashak i i know ook you just cannot help me ram in you my last seven relationships have been abusive right and i'll say back something sometimes well ook if if you tell me that you have at seven relationships that have been abusive and different ways i'll agree with you i only say that cause that is never what someone says right but i think what you are going to tell me is you have conn had the same relationship seven times s not seven things it is one right and that is always i do not think one time yet it is that is failed to be the case and that is how to think about it that is how we start to elusidat what is going on they mit the likeball that goes off i have not had seven different abus ive relationships i have had one that i've repeated seven times and now we stark getting to what is really going on to wat need's to happen that person needs to face what happend in that original abus ive relationship and it always comes down to the same surconcepts of of the person feeling terrified while the abuse was going on feeling guilty feeling ashamed feeling oug they brought it on themselves they deserve it they do not deserve anything better right because the brain is trying to make sense of it right or i i thought i could make that oke but i could not right and then there is more guilt and more shame and if thats stuck inside of someone nig that is bundled up in side of some one ou know a medical absess inside a person it wold off infection inside the body this is the same concept in the brain then of course the limic system is goingo on a fix that and and it fixes it by trying to let us recreate that situation and make it right this time and that is a minutes i think that one of the best examples of how the right approach of iw let us look at that let us talk about that right what is really going on there wait who should feel guilty and ashamed of the person who was abused of the person who as abusing right and and we can get at what is going on inside the person that is what changes that nd then the aigth relationship can be entirely different than the first seven rigt and i see that all the time and in this is not eso teric or soft i see that play out clinically over and over again and why to things get better because we go to the trama and we unlock it it is not hidden inside were con control things right we bring it to the surface and then wwe can take away it is power i keep hearing in the narrative that much of our reflective response to trama with emotional and rethe repetition compulsion and trems of behaviours is about some very deep attempt to change the past yes and in faction in awfuline conversation i i recall a you sayi something about this that the number of behaviours and thoughts and avoidance of behaviors and avoidance of thoughts that human beings put into try and change o the past ise is remarkable and eary and maladapt if it is itis elselike yes and that really stuck with me becaus i think we all want to feel we are in control of our future and how we feel in the moment and to some extend it it works for a brief while there is thi thing that happened and it just i evokes some internal arousal and then you have to know what to do with that arousal and i think of for many people and clean myself there is thes this fundamental question oquet that the thought about the thing the event or events plurabl evokes is arousal this internal states make some people feel sleepy and exhausted other people feel really anxious other people feel angry i mean that terousal has all these diffent dimentions is as ayou know and then there is discrustion but what to do with it and and i'd love to hear a theye even just a a top contour prescriptive of what owhat does one do i'll even just put myself in what do i do hive sim feeling upset about something should i feel my options are healthy catharsis i can tell the story feel it i could i can pack it down a we hear that it is bad to pack it down but of course one has to be functional in life om and deal with things and weave responsibilities a work in relational responsibilities et cetera we need ta sleep at night catharc is healthy catharcis packing it down at the other extreme telling the story and yet i think a lot of people are afraid to tell the story because it is on in that telling there is a perhaps a re emergence of the arousal the rousal can become greater i me ge it is that what people mean when they say things are goig to get worse before they get better i m i guess the simple version of this long winded question is it is clear we need to confront these things we cannot change the past by a reflective response is not going to do that efficiently and how do we deal with arousal how does one take what they feel inside about something shameful what he do with it in a moment and does that have to be done in the presence of a skilled traine therapist or as am driving to work in the morning and something comes up i cannot deel with this right now comes to mind what do i do do i deal with it right then i know thice is a big raalty to mentional question but i think it is the one that a lot of people grapple with we want to deal with things how do we deael with that internal arousal yeyewe often try and change the trama of the past in order to control the future and what what that really adds up to is the trama of the past dominates our present right and it does not have to be that way in remember whete talking about tramas that rise to the level of changing the brain as you are saying that involves re experience it involves hyper vigilance increased arousal it changes in mood states changes in anxiety changes in sleep changes in behaviour these are all changes that it is not push towards dominating our present right and and then we are not really living in the present right as we are trying to control the futurewher i can do a great job of controlling our future if we are not really living in the present right and teso the way to come at that egand in the moment if you saint ok the moment if i need to fall asleep right i might selk get let me tr and put that out of my mind let me try and thought redirect there is short term strategies that can let us be functional in the contects of these changes but the answer is to go look directly at that thing right elook at that trama explore that trama and sure that can be done with a professional and sometimes that is what makes sense but not always right sometimes it can be done by talking to another person right writing it down right look at what is going on inside of me that my mind is stuck to this let us explore that because it is almost as if we are we are afraid often of looking at the trama that has changed us that we will look anywhere but at that right is let iu's it is chidden in a closet and we will shine light everywhere else whe were knockin o open that door and that is where wou're people will say that same as eve heard over and over and i myself have thought this at times ike if is talk about that on then t star crying and never stop right or i'gin to just fall apart right which is never what hivas no one ever starps crying and never stops right what ends up happening is when the person puts words to it right i could be in writing co be talking to a trusted other or with e therapist rigt things start to change mean just the fact that you can talk about it you can put word to it and other people do not recoil right mean how many times is some one said something for the first time right and and when there telling me about the trama th there there is such an anxious lookng as if im can be wrongn to recoil from it right meaning i'm going to recoil from them right in then there is a sense of surprise if the person says well and i was abused by this coachwhen i was akid rigters and and there is not o kithers there is not a response of recoiling you can see the change and people will say a lot well it i'm i cannot believe you can hear me say that o bou o came with it right i means you think but what is going on inside f them get howm what a a sense of shame a sense of this is something awful about me for people to recoil from and it is just not true but but ther heres were troma is it is insidious right and it is pervasive right because if that convinces us to continually hide it away then how do we explore it that that example of of the person i is look i was abused by a coach when i was a child me i'm thinking of it of a couple very real cases rigtabit people that i've taken care of and once they start talking about it then they start talking about how an they were just innocent kids right and they didn know and they really want to be on the team where this coach was treating them as special and and now they can look at themselves from the outside right they can look at themselves they would look at some one else right you think it is easy for us to see what s to real and true if it is some one else and if you ask lonely what what do you think of someone whos ten eleven years old whose abused and manipulated ind abuse by an adopis all my goodness i feel compassion for that person right but if it is us right then ona it is guilt and shame we have to hide it away and when the person starts looking at it tit can to see it from the outside and it starts to take the energy out of it right then what who should feel guilty about that who is done something wrong and lit now the conceptions come together which is often a reflectsive that was my fault oh i i did it i i went back to it ike i i still stayed on the team i went back next season right i let it happen again bat all the guilt and shame inside the person gets jucks topposes what really happen there and then they set right i was a terrified child right and understand at all and they can come to a place of compassion and now we are working against the guilt and shame and if the person cries about it thet's great riti me crying is one of the best coping mechanisms we have it does not hurt us and it lets us greve things yet we cannot grieve if there is guil and shame inside was it just blocks grief right we have to tit has to be a clean slate in a sense in order to feel sadness and then you see that it shifts from aanxiety anger and frustration usually directed towards itself guilt and shame toords a towards being able to process it and being able to bring to bear some compassion and being able to direct the negative emotion to speak where the're warranted and my goodness the shanges that happen mes nowling as people are miraculously cured right but it is remarkable how just getting it out there and have one hour of talking that what we are talking about now can can leave a person feeling immensely better it seems to me in hearing this tat there is this werd wiring we have because what i'm hearing is when tromas happened to us are we observe them what we need to do most is to confront those and the emotions around that directly yes but instead our system defaults to guilt shame yes and try to hide it yes and this rep etition compulsion of placing us back in to things similar to those tramas or even may be even worse tramas ye in an attempt to resolve it it is the most maladaptive yes wiring diagram i could possibly think of emotional and presemtly physiological wiring diagram yes and this notion of trying to change the pass by doing things now when the exact opposite is what is going to be beneficial lsoes seems yet complete the whole system seems completely backwards and im i'm chuckling as i said it is not because i'm amuse is because i'm just baffled once again at how our wiring can often not serve us well but it raises it what i think is it i important an interesting question which is eallier you are talking about how your people will seek out media that is really disturbing they will tramatize and retramatize themselves on the daily basis that could be viewed as the repetition compulsion or the person will have the same relationship with seven different tis a abusive relationship with severn different partners in sequence seems terrible and yet as i say this it also is becoming clear to me how this almost seems a a a poor but desperate attempt to resolve it yes some way and the the poork in the road if i understand correctly is to really get to the seed incident really get to the thing that startit it all as opposed to repeating it all yes does that have to be done in the presence of a therapist is is there benefit to taking a walk and thinking about these things breaking down and crying if that is what is necessary or feeling angry if that is what comes up the the reason i ask it this way is because i worry i'll just speak to my of my own experience i worry that in reactivating or rtouching into the emotions around something that that is itself a form of the repetition compulsion because you are feeling it all over again it justn you are not seeking out something to evoke that feeling i realize this is a little bit of a circular argument am et ward er question but i think it is one that i really struggle with and trying to parse all the the i what i that that the outcome base therapees that i hearabout and i'm and the the recommendations that people make i mean how should we conceptionalizes something happens sounds lic we need to deal with that thing directly do we need to do that with somebody else can we do that on our own if we are we do not have resources and we have to do it on our own cannot hire someone cannot pay someone to work with us how do we do that in a way that is not retramatizing ourself in a major way or in a minor way it how how do we know where we are in that landscape agen there is ithink's great questions and an ithing it starts with real introspection when things are bound sing around in our minds often it is very non productive right it is the same thing over and over againd and that is not helpful for us right there is an idea which sometimes gets called and observing ego rght the debility to stop and look at what is going on inside of ourselves and it if we are just thinking about it and we are thinking in the same way we sood ofe and i sent always think about it then all were doing is reinforcing the trama right but if we cin distance enough to be hom it is i'm interested in what is going on inside of me right the can think of a certain person who nw who really loves music and and it is some point in our therapy work i learnd shewas taking long drives but the the radio was not on ndis what is going on right and i asked and what was going on if she was running over and over again in her head i'm a loser i'm a loser right and she did not want the music on because's the music wuld drown out what she felt she had to say to herself right and it was that wow that is interesting right and then her ability to observe that and to think why am i doing that when it comes into her mindlic what is that trace to when did i start doing that look us it im i'm saying it for poent of exaggeration lik nobody comes out of the womb no programme to think i'm a loser right we do not we do not think that when we are born or where does that come from then we can think in ways that allow us to have new thoughts right that we were not having's not just bouncing round in our minds and if we speak or right there even more mechanisms that come on line in our brains right that that are then st of maundering mechanism we think in a different way if were using words right and we we ar better able often to bring in that observing egl what is going on inside of me it can be very helpful to think it can be helpful to talk to some one to a trusted other no friend family clergy i to wrigt mean these or things it can be done without expending any resources right and and sometimes it can make really a big difference right was a wait when did i start thinking that and that in interestingly in this case lokan we did it in therapy but we became very clear what that was rooted to right and then in the the therapy which was still relatively young but we would done i several sessions and we we were not talking at all about what we needed to talk about right but that is what got us to what we needed to talk about and when did that start and nour in that same place of exploring that and what was the reflex to it and the sense of guilt and sense of shame and it is we are all of that came from that just got boiled down to a loser right which which this person did not even havein their mind i did not think about myself that wight right n ess i's interesting right that our memories tdo not in in of themselves have meaning is their flat or er colorless right and and there coloured in by the emotions that we attached to them right the idea that thatthat certain memories now before the trama were changed right by the trama i i told the stori sometimes a person who onted a word when they were in high school that they thought was i mi gos ic it shows i can do it right and get out there that after trama they sall the word with the negative emotion attached to it that was always given to me an it nd deserve it and almost it was backing theres going to be the greatest achieveint o my life and i was seventeen ors and tik to have some one think that is not how they felt about that at the time it is the trama that changed the thi self talk the internal state going fullword and to what miraculous in a negative way also change that going backward ight and and when we can really look at thik word it that come fram and we can start unravelling it it changes in those cases you often it is helpful to have a good pherapist it is not always necessary and and it certainly it is not always possible right we we need other strategies im and some of those i write about some of those in the book of how how can we to get at trama without those formalized mechanisms i'm and sometimes if i the symptoms are significant enough it we really do nee to talk to somebody professional who can who can help us get to the root of the trama and many times that is the answer to what is going on with people in people i've seen of at five residential stays i'm not exaggerating this for mental health reasons for substance reasons and no one's ever takein a trma history an knowing you take a trama history wt that is obviously where this is all coming from riht that is when the drug you started truly thereafter the negative self talk in e negatve feelings that led to the druggies then you go after the trama and and you can change things where as trying to change things without looking introspecting talking about the trama i i think of course was futie do you think tha people who can start to have negative phantasies when you mention this woman whoud take these long drives to berate herself i'm i'm not familiar with that but i i'll give alobit of personal disclosure dr i've felt i' several times in my life that i will start tus i' create a narrative about something that truly has not happen about something terrible that somebody is going to do yes that is going to upset me yes and for the longest time i oud wonder why my doing this and and i have a a couple ideas about why one is that i was attempting to just a void thinking about other things it is just your anger is such a an attractive emotional orson innocent it is an attractent idt's not attract we do not it and yet oftentimes s a anger is a great way to replace feeling some something else yes im feeling sad or having come up or to do work or to do something useful 'm it has this kind of a but lik gravitational force to it that was one idea the other idea was in imagining and of worst outcomes then act ally that relationship were could i shl seem a lot better in reality it is almos creating this negative contrast yes lik kno well then it is not that bad and and then the third possibility is i have no idea why but it seemed a reflecton id spend sometimes thinking about i cannot save resolved it completely but why would somebody have a narrative a a default narrative when driving or when walking of i'i'm just cont spend some time and and thing about how terrible this thing is gon a turn out or how some one's went upset me or harmy or how terrible i am a it seems again maladapt ives thinking maladaptive wiring and yet i've to assume that it serve some purpose ye ye may i think there three factors there and they are all bad and i n n tink you spoke to at least two of that right ther thit may i think speak powerfully to how insidious troma is and how these are real brain changes inside of us i would say athe threefactors punishment avoidance and control i the troma inside of us that that makes a guilt and shame often often leads to a desire to punish oneself ight an the idea that oh that was my fault or i deserve that well what whatd we do if something is some one's fault than some one now deserves punishment right mean wwe we punish them right we send em to cail we give them a fine right we punish them as what what we do is punish ourselves right we if we tell ourselves we are loserer this awful thing is going to happen right than part of what we are doing is saying to ourselves see right you deserve that your now can have anything better rights it is a negative's a very negative way that the brain tries to make us in a send to do better by hurting us more for the things that we could not and should not have been able to wern't expected to be control in the first place i the second is distraction as you said anger that kind of fantasy can distract us from from i affect feeling an emotion that can be much more negative anger it can be more gratifying than then then sently then guilt or shame although guilter and chanecans erve a punishment purpose but if anger is directed also towards ourselves right than it can serve punishment to punishment avoidance and the sense of control that if you think ahad te something awful that your imagining is going to happen we maybe that will let you avoid it right mean you consee the brain here in since really confuse mean part of the brain wants to punish part of the rain is one to think about it at all and part of the brain wants to make it better and and then how all of that resolves if we are not aware that a this isnin the contects of our brains being deeply impacted by trama what is going on here is all maladaptive right as these negative fantasies of the future they may help us feel better about something in the present but they do not help us make anything better it they do not help us make anything better this is the kind of to see quelli this is where troman and all this reflective stuff that happens after troma ultimately lead us and you can see how we get lost how i've seen over and over again in my own life in the lives of other people how man we get stock in those situations that is why i see people sometimes this has ben going on for thirty years forty years ra and it just been going on over and over and over again because there is no natural end to any of this right unless we we look at it in a different way that we have knowledge and information wo this isn the way it has to be let me bring a novel perspective to this it does not change on its own im struck by your statement that these thoughts or behaviors can make us feel better but they do not actually make anything better in that way it this mode of imagining terrible outcomes starts to immediately seem taking opioits a it you feel better in the moment but it does not actually make anything better and it i probably makes things worse yes and and just as question of how how much worse an and and in what direction yes and i just what want a just pause on that on that concept because i think that concept of makes us feel better but does not make anything better i think answer's an earlier question about the this what seems to be a totally maladaptof wiring diagram we need to confront the thing but we do not want to go into the repetition compulsions there is a theresit'it is a knife edge there to navigate through trama yes working with a very skill clinistion yourself i think is the ideal circumstance for for people an of course there are people who cannot access support from somebody for whatever reason a you have talked about a journaling yes as a useful tool am could it may be o highlight some of the other a things that people can do on their own and then i'd also to talk about what makes for a good therapist what should people look for for those that are our seeking therapy specially nowadays when a lot of therapy is being done remotely but let us to start with the the a et just call them a self generated or zero cost sorts of things at journaling being the first a tand what are some of the others and and what cond of structure would you recommende soone put around journaling am terry turn round all day and jot things down as they come up wor sit down and spend an hour writing in complete sentences for instance yet if i could add something to what you just said but before the question i that that we have these short term coping mechanisms in us right and in way it make sense right we find ourselves in just terrible situations then a short term coping mechanism can get us through them right our brains are built that way and that is part of survival too right and whether now in the mo otern world whether it is it is food it is drugs its sex it is alkoholl right or it is negative thoughts right this is short term soothing even the negative thoughts an anger short term soothing at the expense of long term change right and that is where addictive pathways cannot come into play and and that is where again are how we are built evolutionarily for survival does not help us in the way humans have evolve u wement live this way throughout your mindyn in poi nine something per cent of human history write en we are not adaptet to this i want just make a point of saying that about the short term soothing at the expense of any of longterm change and then ha thethe question you had asked about ta journalling or what can we do that is outside of a a professional i think the hall mark of it has to be bringing new eyes to it right that thinking about self with a curiosity instead of just a simple automaticity or repetition right lik why am i thinking about this when did this start why is this in me that it is that that whether it is words or whether we are writing that is important i think for journalling it depends on the person i we we kdo not somebody carring round a journal all day if then there is a compulsion to any to writ about everything it is going on to my mind right that might be good to look an write a little bit at night right or some one who might think sometimes this really comes into my mind in a strong way and it could be unpredictable right i on't have ththe journal with me ah that thing is back in my mind now let me writ about it right because then putting words to it and then be able to read those words right and when people read even to a little bit of journalling and they read oh i i thought again about how materrible person who cannot have a good life because i because i was in such a bad car accident or because that person attacked me or because when i was in school i was bully because i look different than everyone else right or act ed different for everyone else wow 'to actually see that written ow it is you kno it is a little bit of that ire's a little bit of that when you are saying it to some one as if it wore some one else right because now there is enough distance from it i'm looking at the words i wrots right that we get some distance and we can start to integrate some of the not just a compassion but integrating compassion and logic right look i feel a sense of compassion o it what is this mean what really happened here right and cash i did start thinking differently after that i shought it tot that is where this came fri'm wright that is why i'm saying this it is those kind of revolations that we can have through again the written or spoken word and i think oe get that involves a trusted other your or writing and i think that those are ways we can do this where we bring some d novo perspective to something that often has been bouncing around inside of us and it is amazing to me that i can see such intelligent and pathically tuned people who have had the same thing running over and over again in their mind for years and it just points out that our brains do not automatically say a wait a second ou d have in spnding wheels here for a long long time was in another way to look at this we need something from the outside which can just be knowledge riht which is wh i think what we are doing here or the reason i wrote the book that i wrote was was a apprehending this ik iamazing surprise to me right which is a wouic some huge percentage of everything i'm treating is rooted in trama and the opacity of trama i which is why we do not see that oh the depression the panic attacks the life change the eddiction the kno the maladaptive choices o that this is all coming from trama because it hides itself in that in that opacity we need a denooa perspective if we are doing it on our own and we need that if were doing it in therapy which might lingth ik finding the right therapistri which is also part of your yestion i deafonaly want to know about how to assassin find the right therapis before i we would a cover that however am something came up in the course of your answer a i can immediately relate to this idea that certain behaviors are a really maladaptive in our ar am stuffing things down or avoiding the topic am is problematic and bringing it curiosity and an introspection almost a third personing of the experience that we have had in order to try and address it from it through an from a new truly from a new perspective it occurred to me as as we were discussing tus however that some people and and yes may be i'm talking well be about my own experience we we have a sense of our own identity and our and how people view us in our ability to befunctional in the world in was that we efact if at work or a good brother or good mother father human being in the world we have relationships and i think that one thing that i have heard a and maybe i've experience is that sometimes those am maladaptiv thoughts or behaviors the things that generate a kind of a repetition of anger or of arousal or activation or sadness that we have some internal process where we we funnel that into a functionality in the world we am i'll give a more concrete example am in thinking about things that have upset me in the past and in imagining a bad out comes in the future there is a certain internal state of arousal that comes about and for many years i was able to use that not to feel angry but rather to work an exstra three hours day or it to pack my scadul with am work and social engagement ect a show in a way that i hopefully was a very good brother to my sister for a instance in a way it was a am it was a transformation of something negative inside of me into a functionality in the world that was actually very rewarding and beneficial yes and yet in describing it i can immediately see how it would be wonderful if i could source from something else and yet i you can imagine and and i can imagine how one would be am reluctant maybe even terrified of giving up that source a's a fuel yes and and i think in knowing some of the tramas of other people and their reluctance to work through those ibe sa'm not a therapist since this over and over again that one's positive identity can often be linkd to something difficult an than ast and people are reluctant to give up this fuel yet because it it it is in that sense its functional am the only thing that allowed me to in a start to address this and and why i'm still curious about this cause i do not think i've work through this proces completely get alon more self disclosure there is that i was told that these words just imagine how much better it would be if you could source from a different fuel ma fuel that felt better maybe it was on the it was on this this sentence it was maybe you could actually be much more effective yes maybe you could be ten times the better brother yet mayte you could i have ten times more aminside or work capacity et cetera it is on that hint of a promise that i at least i was inspired to start looking into these things and reading about trama in your book and elsewhere in search a thing about this igain i realize tis as a long windede a questionor somewhat complex idea but i thing or i hope that people will be able to resonate with this idea that sometimes we want o stay attached to the that this short term soothing that the punishment distraction or control because it evokes this arousal and then we can apply that arousal yes yes think what you are describing map to think clinically to what git is called sublimation there is something negative inside of us but wee sood a transfer that energy we transfer that into something that is adaptiver that is positive the idive anger right i think of that thing in it makes anger in me i channel that into harder work right or i channel that intelle cong in it gol be nicer to my brother some grigt something that and and there is validity to that right and it but be can becomelic self justifying if person thinks well lok look at what this is doing for me right i would not work as hard without it to right now we side to become attached to the trama where as i think what you had said is absolutely true that just because we can sublimate some of the negative affect feeling emotion that comes from trama into something productive does it mean that that is best i me know we can get to our destination by taking a very circuritous ralt right we might wastin our getting there but we get there that does not m ean that that is best and it also does not look at all the negative rit this example to wasted fuel wasted time right we get somewhere but we are not optimizing and i have yet to see one person who who has a dress the tromat and become less functional i it is always i the're just as function but they are happier i or more functional because as you say just because we may be able to sublimate we maybe what is going onwould be ten times better i if if we if we were not sublimating because the sublimation limits us rigt it limits are perspective to only what we can see and do through the lens of the drama and that is never better than the alternative thank you for that ye you o yelet us discuss how one corter should go about finding it a really good therapist i tipicallye thes in my experienceis done by word of mouth the others this person you might want o work with them theyre really grea what are some of the characteristics that one should look for and i'm should we takein to account whether or not we are a person who for instance i've heard this from from listeners although i'm clear i'm defliy not talking bout myself here in i'm cloaking something some people say i want a work wor the somatic therapist because i've outually heard some one say i think in feels they youn i feel stuff in my bodyso i want to work with some one who can really acknowledge that or some one else will say im you kni want a work with somebody who has this orientation or that orientation or is am open to my particular life style or is not goingto tell me that i have to leave my relationship u kno i fee line people already show to the question of who to work with with all these things internally some of which are voice and some of which o are not i love or you to talk of hat may be some of the the coor features of a really good therapist and then how how to look for a therapis and also how to think about onesself in looking for a therapist because of i east kount of predispositions i well thi lot of data about this over over the years that feeling at what ar the top ten i important fact is to find in a therapist just repeat repor ten times i mean that is the key and if you think about that it is pretty amazing ri because far peutic modalities can be different i and i think what what that is telling us is in a way something very obvious rilic what is report of me you knowit is it' someboady's paying attention right it is truss it is a back and forth it is is yeveand i'm doing of doing something difficult i'm doing it with some one is really helping e some one who is in it with me right some one 's really paying attention wants me to be better that is indispensableimanis just indispensable and i write in the book is some one a therapis not making i contact or this is the way they do it ri and we may got a fit into the box of the way they do it that is not going to be helpful and in th en what i what i think about that is the different modalities it does not actually tell us that oh the modality's irrelephant i think that is not trugh i think that good therapis are not pigeon hold by a certain modality they they may you will come at the world largely through a psychodynamic or a s b t or a d b t lends lots of different men a ways to do therapy but when you really talk to those people really good experience therapis it is all coming through the vehicle of the report but they are practically shifting to what the person needs no i i do not understand the at the idea that lie i just do this right i do not do that and whet when people or pigeon hold that way i do not think they help their patients very well right wwe have to be diverse enough to say i want all the arrows in the quiver right and and even though there might be one that i favor and that' seme lends i see things through no i can be versital i can shift i can adapt to what this person needs and i think if if you have that if you have got a if you have that you got a winning combination right people should perhaps try a few therapists and maybe have a session or two or three to see if they the reporter feels it is taking route is that you have that right yen i thint get's whyt word of mouth is importand mit if someone you trust tells you hay this is a good person that says a lot right a already makes the pretest probability i's quite high but yes it is interesting to see when people i have a therapist or ther callor insurance and ther signed to therabis this thought that oh that is the person i have to have now and it is now you should look at that any one and you would be interviewing right for you will for a job right but but you get a bring again the right sed of thoughts to that it is to be help to wright which is that i want some one who has report with me i do not want some one who is can to make it easy right who is well it is goshos cow pleasant because them that means a're not talking about the difficult things right if one brings i know this is not can n be easy i got to talk about difficult things right even if one does not recognize or got to talk about the tromet in me right but to go to therapy thinking no it is i mean sometimes it is enjoyable but a lot of times reghd it is not right it is hard work it can be excruciating w can cry doing it but to say right that that is how 'm goingto be helped and i want some one who is going to do that with me who who is really looking at what is going on inside of me how do we help me and i can feel sort of the robusness of that if one brings that approach an then looks at the therapists through that lens you'r you are very likely to then move on from someone who is not a good choice right and really stick with some one who is even though that does not mean it is always pleasant and enjoyable mean to house to not be that sometimes right may we could drol ll deeper in to the mechanics of therapy am i put out a few questions to audience and asking what they want to know about therapyan it was amazing i hundreds if not thousands of respondse to saying how should i show up to therapy for instance should people take a five minutes a meditative dro en before or should they just shw up cold and let it emerge during thera be i is it a good idea to take notes or da not take notes and then post thera be how should clients patience as the have sometimes called one or the other i never know which how should they cross uss that information should they take some designate time afterwards and your an ideal we will take a thirty menute walk afterwards and think about the material or should they sat it aside and come back to it of course theyre constrained a work and family et cetera but we there is a lot of knowledge out there about had a best show up to a work out i one out for five ten minutes then do this et cetera and then the cool down a'm and youre were talking about hard psychological work amd a bettering oneself to my knowledge i i've not ever seen this information anywhere be very useful to hear your your thoughts on thus ye we will not try to duck the question but but but i think it vary much by pesent youing bet the first parto our question i think was how to show up if thera be right and i think the answer would be whatever lets you be fully present when you'r infher be nout for some people this going to be i show up early an i sat i call myself and meditate a little bit and that is how then their present ightfor other people theys they would show up walking to the room that can stop another present t wos whatever works for that persen that they are really there their thoughts their energy is really in what is going on and the same thing amplies on the other and know the're people who there really well servedby you'l going for walk if they can or sitting quietly after there be got a putting that in order right otherwise they lose some if it righter some of the ahas riter the follow that is an interesting thought that they really need to put it in order may be that involves taking some notes during ther be rigt for other people they need to do the exact opposite they need to leave nothing about that at all and then they can reflect on it later and learned from it were different o human being thot such a diversity in us that that i there is no hard answer to that bus they being present when it is happening then being able to suit a consolidate and and retain what is been gained is most important and we have to figure that out person by person mean i try and do that in the work of wike what would serving this person best and sometimes we thel sometimes it evolves and sometimes we talk about it but they vary much if some one were thinking about enbarking on thera be or more therape i to address troma or just general issuse of life what is the frequency that you recommend i could imagine two extreme models one as okey i'm gin a finely tackle this trama i'm going to do therea be three times a week but for a shorter period of time ye six months it you knover and out am verses this open ended model of once a week typically a for as long as it takes right right i think that all varies am and i work with people an varied ways from some one 's doing well n we me for half hour every six months right to doing week long hourly sessions to spending three intense days with some one in er rown right i think as far as ti guina guiding principles what i have found in my own life caus i i i value my own therapy a i tremendously ive found in my own life and in my own clinical work that if it is less than once a week and it is hard for us to retain really e we spend a lot of time kind of catching oban what is happened let us get back to the place we were at before which is what i think if we are really going to get somewhere were not just try to maintain something right than i think once a week for an hours really kind of the minimum right but more intensive works the more intens it is it is it is it is not linear rihts an expinantial gain we we do a lot of intensive work right where t were someone will come and and do thirty clinical hours with us over the course of a week five or six different clinitions thirty clinical hours and you we have found that the benefits of doing that are immense is i git is a a years worth of theraby consolidated and you tik uill thirty hours lets ay n we go almost every week made it is forty five or fifty hours but thirty hours with that kind of intensity is worth py sixty hours done in a different way because then iit is its in us in anactive way riht it is in the therapists in an active way becomes very very dynamic i think turning up the intensity if there is something that we really need to process absolutely make centes and i do that my own life is something nows ik wo sreally something is really distressing me and it is linking into prior trama and i can see what is going on an me and i start thave ruminative thoughts with negativitomic i hare go more right because i got to do that processing i can get to the place that i am which is not that that the trama has no impact on me right is that the impact is much last than it was before the therapy and that i most often more often than not have an ability desee when it is now intruding into my thoughts and it is taking me away from what i really think in believe or being able to draw logic in emotion together and make oo decisions turning up the intensity then absolutely make cent this a very deep intensive work of thirty hours in a week a what brings somebody to some athe type of work o that sort is it a suicide orescartend a ats severediction of situation n owhow does one gage how much theraby they they ought to be doing and i should it always be on the therapists to decide that frequency wyou want wat would bring some one to to a situation of five therapists and thirty hours a week in one week right om right it' it is usually a person who is really distressd by something or whether that is its it is negatively impacting their life er life or sometimes he person comes to realization is cannot take this any more right i'm i'm sick of te siclical depression i cannot get a stop having panic ters lik i i need help right but it it is usually some you kno crisis point with the idea o of crisis in the meaning of okae something comes to a head and after wit things ging to be different right not o crisis and things into be negative after words but a point where where than that that cognit of flexibility comes to the forof wy aneed to do something different right that that is often what brings us no sometimes is other people pointing it out or is somebody is had an intervention somewhere or yes that person's been hospitalized after a suicide a temt or they have gone back to to rehave again an for the third or fourth time in their life is really in danger sometimes it is that and sometimes as to person realizing he i just want i avnt a look at myself hen understand myself better ou i know that what is going on in me is not as good as it can be right i think people can come to it for all sorts of different ways am and i think yes i think a lot times it would be the therapist to say t lixs more wore you kno more intensive work or can make i aa difference bt i think the person also needs to youno take ownership right of their own therapians if i do not feel hoped enough well ive to think about that right and and talk to the therapist about thagas it maybe it maybe that therapist is in a match right r maybe talk to the therapist in the therapists can change his a reproach right or maybe talk to the therapist and increase the frequence he right but the idea is to to be aware of it right and if one's needs are not being mat to acknowledge that rate as people can get into a rhythm of therapy were it is really not helping them right but they either feel of nichalistic abad al no better and i'm going to therpy right or sometimes there is a sense that while men therapy somekind of checking that box of doing something for myself bit is not really getting me anywhere and then the part of the brain that is controlled by the guilt and shame and avoidance thinks that is a great idea right again this ability to observe ourselves what is going on my being helped in the way i do i feel help right am i in some ways even even happy that a'm not feeling helps o enough to face this thing i do not want a face right or mi to afraid to say i need more help byt do we really need to look at ourselfes and this is where the insurance systems often are very difficultas it is hard sometimes for person is howin need more therapecause that may not be possible right that there are of negative factors in the world around us but ultimate i think the answer to the question comes down to observing ourselves and taking ownership of what is going on on us and how we are feeling and an then feeling that that commit met to selve for ito self care to say i need to go change this and for those that a maybe do not have the means or insurance or access to do even i'm one day we there be a in the journaling model i'm could one perhaps take an entire day as a awful as it might seem to do a lot of journaling and thinking and walking ior do a self generated intensive i'm do you think there is utility to that there could be but get depends by person cause there there could also be something negative about that of its isome one who is not at the point not ready for that rightme we we do not come at you we do not come directly at the trama immediately at least in most of the time we do not do that iand and we often do not explore it in death this idea that oh that person nows to go through every second of the trama is it she not true i mean sometimes it is but that is that is not the common situation rig's more often that person as to acknowledge the example of i was sexually abuse and if thit acknowledge that and to and say o k gosh what is that done to me that does not mean l let us parside every moment of how that was and the terror of that right that can lead people to a worse place right i think the idea of biting off small pieces to speak where person is writing right or is talking bui think if one is writing it is good to communicate with another right another trusted person and if there is not someone in one's personal life n there clergy members even if one is not effiliated with an organized religion i ould probably go places and get a clergy to one to help you right i men there people out there who want to help other people is it would if some one has no one mean almost never do we have no one here right as we could probye go find some one but we we we need to a take that in pieces there is some risk ot trying to do the intensive thing on one's own and and that is wher i would put in if we have a persons having suicidal thoughts or even thoughts of death of not wanting to be alive i do not deserve to be alive mean these ere warning signs for really getting help there are some signs tot say he do not try and do that on your own right go to go try and find a resource and it is no things it get to that level of severity of aan often a person knows that of me and i in a place where i know i'm not healthy and i'm i'm having in a kind of scary thoughts than then we need that that is a person who really should be doing that on the rown ver thank you for that ye welcome we have been talking a lot about talking and i'm now i'd to talk a a bit about chemistry yes i'm drugs yes i'm may be first we could talk prescription drgs you are psychitres o you are approve to and presently do prescribe medication i'm were were appropriate nthis is a vast landscape of course we have got eighty h t i should just tell you i get more questions about eighty t and the drugs related t ghty ht and dopeming than any other topic any other topic there is eighty eighte there is o sedy there is depression there is anta tepressan and forth is there some way that we can you wrap our arms round all of that at as a way of wating into this tat on this drug question and just address how does one decide when medication is useful because in the end im the dissection tool that the psychiatris stores theirapise has is language and it some point one has to make an assessment about dopamine or saratonan or rather not a given drug would help and most therapes i believe do not involve am putting some one in a brain scanner and to my knowledge there still is not a very good blood tess to assess always tos persons dopenmin low or high corect me if i'm wrong and ultimately that a and inother companies out theres 'm not try to under mind those companies but if i happen to do that in the statement if if you take a bloodsess and find that your seratone and metabolites are low my nderstanding is it it is possible that you are too low in seratonent in the brain but that is a very indirect window into what is really going on how d how does the how do you think about prescription drugs in the contects of treating a trama and other in other conditions and then maybe will drill into some of the more specific conditions sure v nowit first comment that there aren'nt tests for these things and i thin the test for matabolites nang things are different you kow by the time what we are talking madiben metabolized often to some very significant extent left the brain nowts in the purfrual blood that we really do not learn from that and i think that we tend to over utilized medicines in this country because we have a healthcare system that that often ithit is based ons trough put that we want to polishe the hood when this a problem in the engine right we over utilized medicines often as an end point i alway can make that persons depression better with an anti depressent well i mean maybe right but most of the time for the presons depression to really get better and stay better they need to unravel what is driving the depression right the first step is i think there cut two steps to it rit the first assessmen step is is there a diagnosis that that the vast majority of the time if not somethings all the time really warrants a medicine the by polar disorder o c d a d d these are diagnoses that we we understand more about them and what is going on in the brain and how medicines can treat or stabilize that which does not mean the medicineis necessarily it is not a substitute for therapy but sometimes the medicine and therapy can go hand in hand for ose de for example warrants therapy but it almost not always but it almost always warrants medicine too that you can ease the systems that are making the rigidity in the repetition in the brain the first kind of branch point can be what is the diagnosis what is the level of severity and i think that that is very very important where i think it is a little more it maybe even interesting is using medicines to help the person engage in the therapy as productively as possible and and heres where i think weare limited by how we categorize medicines and this sot of farmisutaclinsurance driven a medical system we have that i think throws as off in tremendous way you think about how medicines are categorize o anti depressencs in the vast majority of people who are helped by anti to pressines theyr not they do not have clinically severe depression right those medicines create more distress tolerance in us rin if you think about how helpful that can be if you can to go n egging to do something difficult rygan o bring that tromo or the stressors to the surface and gin a process and you gen a try and make life change if we can make more distress tolerance in us that can be much better right and think by the category of medicines that are caught anticycotics which which really puts people off rigtin but but most of the prescriptions for antipsycotics are not for psychosis right and their ways in which low dosing of some of those medicines cand help in tervene in negative pathways right in pathways that are about distress and sending out those tendrils of nurons that are about hypervigilance and a avoidance right in our in our brain and we can often get at that and if you can improve some one's distress toleranc and you can use medicines that that take away what clinically is rumination right not at not the standard meaning of that word but the clinical meaning of it where their distress centers in our brains that are over active and then we get stuck in these maladaptive negative pathways when we think about something over and over and over againd with no real chance of solving it because that is not what is going on inside of us medicines can help that but we have to have some flexibility around their conception and thoug the modern medical system of the fifteen minute visits to a pcychiatris that are that are weaks apard to mean i doft understand how how that goes well right in the vast majority of times i think it does not go well because it is not enough time to do the therap ye even generate the understanding then medicines get thrown of the person this is how you we use i think a proximately five times as much medicine and think across the bord to say the dutch population right in tink why is five times more as a lot more medicine right and the o that they that health care system and an a cultural system that to the best of my understanding is more rooted in taking responsibility for oneself right if a person comes in in collessder all is hi right the first order of business is he coul take better care of yourself right this person really needs to lose some way it exercise more rigt theydn't an not just jumping till i m give your medicine and no and ship shiftyu through the health care system and out the other side of the door right and the same thing is true in mental health no and i an no not try to be critical to to the psychiatris o the nurse practitioners a people who are practicing in that way because often times there is no choice right if the'r working in a health care system that that the standard is is is i'm highly space or space tepart fifteen menute visits what alternative is there right but to look at ook out i'm going to use medicines because i do not have another tool to bring to bear i think the health care system and its focus on through put and it is short term time out on we toe ut short term response right ther short terms soothing at the expense of long term health and i think that is the medaphor for that applies to our health care system right were if if we if we are going to trying treat o symptem in a short term wer cun do it in a fifteen menute visit that we are going to do it in a way that maybe it soothe to symptem maybe it does not but it does not get at the problem we need to invest more resourcece to get at the problem and i think that is where a sort of protest if people as a society we look we do not the way our health care is going if we need more focus on what the actual problems are that yes we would spend more money you do do treating people o taking care of people case more human time but ultimately bu less suffering less death right and ultimately more productivity i think as an economy we would save much money if we spend money on the human aspects of mental health care because people would be more function all ther' spending less time in the hospitall right that there the're more productive when they are working i'm there is less entry into the criminal cominal justice system think medicines get overused it impart for systemic reasons i'm in large part for systemic reasons i'm and also for some of thes categorization reasons oh that person meets some technical criteria for depression we gotg to give them this medicine instead of really thinking what what is going on in this person i see this over and over gain i sees one is on seven medicins and wron't seven medicines to treat seven different symptems and other av sid affects from all those seven medicines maybe two of them are to treat the side effects from the other five right and that is bad iht and if you really get at what is going on in them the the'r doing much better and may be there on two medicines an'l that is an hopeful answer to that is it is a very helpful answer i mean i think 'm at leastin the spiris that i run these days i hear a lot of negative statements about aunti depressents i think i'm old enough to remember the book a listening to prosagand i remember when prosac an and it is and things at first started showing oup in the excitemen an then nowadays i hear more about the problems with all these trugs you knowin and maybe that is just cause i have arms in the but the scientific but also in the cont a wellnoss community where people think a lot about behaviour'll change fortunately i think that is hat that they do that i'm but of course these drugs as you mention can have the normous utility as well i'd to just a pick up on one thene that i have not heard a lot about anywhere else which is the short termers is the long term use of these drugs as i could imagin some one feeling the finalliyg in a tackle something that is been inside them for a long time either because there really struggling or becaue they are just done with not working it through and am and they decide to start a medication a that would give them higher levels of distress tolerance for a short while i mean its hraining to say that someone could not take up a properly prescribe a medication for a week or for a the first three months of the work and then know that they can come off it because i think that the the black and white model about get you reaving a start the drug and slay on it forever or be taking some drugs forever or you nit cannot take anything an ad that jusseems to life does not does life ove at work that way right is there is ther short term use that can be effective absolutely yes as in american medicine we are much better at starting medicines than we are at taking them away right and part of that i think is driven by such a strong presence of the farmi suitable industry and the farm solines pharmosuitacale indistry does a lot of very good things but that there is such thing as too much of a good thing right and then as a society when something seems positive this i think also is human nature we can overinvest in it right you think about when prosac and tthose kinds of medicines came out they were safer medicines ther buildas antie to pressens and th thought wils willtheyregin a fixed epression right tit is not how that works right we look at them as tools right then we can deploy them sometimes for the longer term to sometimes that is necessary but absolutely for the shorter terming absolutely if we thought of prosac an those kind of medicines not as o their antie te pressencs wih that what they do is they they they seem to make there be more sere atone and in certain circuits thatar important for mood regulation anxiety regulation distress tolerance those medicines can really help somebody if they are very severely depress and we wantits who to get to get them feeling better they can also help some one if they could neetuse more distress tolerance in a discreet period of time right when we think about them that way we think about them as tools that we could apply for short term or long tern we do not see them as fixes right and we do not see them as than substitutes for the human to human work that needs to be done mean iht ben is in my training at times in health care systems and i've seen in many other circumstances that look at medicines as ansers and this idea that oh that person is a and a lie times do be a number right n number is the diagnosis and that number gets this medicine and i i'm not sure we could be more misguided thand that and that is what leads to adding medicines adding medicines is not working of course it is not working because no one's really paying attention to what is going on add more medicines and medicines for the medicines and when we know this is true we we did we know this is true but we have not had the wherewithal as a society to say with a lot of things in society to say this is an ok d me we need mor give these people who are trying to help us if any more latitude to help us but we need more human to human contact to get at what is really going on and yes that is an investment of time and energy and money in the short term and sometimes that is money from the systems right but if we do that goodness look at the look at the pay off of that what is your thought about anxiety and eighty h t as separate phenomena et in terms of medication againd eight h d is the the thin that seems to come up most in questions i cannot tell you the number of especially students but also young working professionals and even people who are outside those categories wo are interested in or taking riddle an ater all modaphinel armodaphinal or vive ants because they seem to struggle focussing without it or i do not know cas i'm not one of those individuals or because they seem to dislike how well they can focus when they do take those compounds and miner shending as these compounds mainly increase dopomanurgic transubmission in the brain also a drennalean epineffering in the brain 's the more less stimulants they look a lot at least chemically they look a lot cokene an empedamine although they are they are not quite cokene an enedaming should we be concerned about this am is is a a different sort of epidemic can these drugs be used to train the brain to focus and than people can withdraw from these drugs ii think this is a huge topic and one that maybe warrants it is own episode entirely but salls were on the topic what your thoughts about medication for eighty h to to medication for ighty h t can be extremely effective and the study show show us that they show us that if there is eg d d then medication for hd d is very very helpful and that is true in youths it seems to be true if adults have adolt eighdy h d rahd d we we cann't know that is true but all attention deficid is not attention deficite disorder and there we go to the reflective fifteen minute visits throw medicines at things attention defisit can come from many many places and one of them is anxiety ther there is many other reasons depressin affects attention poor sleep affects attention poor diet can affect attention stressin life can affect attention and is certainly trama and the thing that the promisat tromispinsoff can afect attention en this is realy this is areally the truth that while teaching once about medicines an pharmacology i was frustrated about how the answer to everything was what medicine to e use what medicine do we use as a pose to this is just one piece of the puzzle and i told an anec do which i think it was a clinical anecdote what you think is going on and i think that if i told that to that ar middle school students is somehing thy would probably say you just told the story of a person with a rock in their sue which is what i the story that i was actually kelling i but several people i was talking to their physicians i w t a d d elike notherevery nother person steps down the rock hurts and hey're not able to maintain attention right that is what is going on but we are program to think about medicines and in appropriate use of a d d medicines as you said there is dop o manergic in pact there is epinefra nourope an efor an impact we are effecting what are ot prefrontal alpha two receptors that really need to be helped if there is real a d d but if there is not that is not a good thing to do which is why it is quite fascinating that when people have a d d they tolerate generally stimulants very well without the other problems that can come of stimulants and and i do not know do not cling to know why that is but we we see that phenomenon but when people are being treated for a d d and they do not have a d d which sometimes they know they do not have a d d but the stimulants make them function better they go to somebody get the stimulants that is that is not a good thing to do ake is god stimulants when they are not needed over time they do affect our physical function they effect our judgment trit they are lot of negative things that come from that they can effect the vigilance in side of us yes it is a valad diagnosis but it gets made when it is not present very often i'm which we see with a lot of diagnoses that you can throw medicine at we see the same thing with my polar disorder true by polar disorders extremely important to utilized medicines effectively but how many people are diagnose with my poet isorder who ave they have absolutely do not a by polar disorder i'm but it is it could be a cachal diagnosis because there is in a set something to do for it in quots right and you can throw medicine at it right an mean what we expect right if we have if we have a healthcare system were you fifteen minute visits with your psychiatrs of course were ging to throw medicines at everything and then the training paradimes are ging to look at it through that lends and then very often cand i give the example of seeing somebody on seven medicines mean the first thought i have is how many of those medicines are actually counter productive and a lot of the times s noft l every now and then one is counter productive now that is the case that is the case a lot of the time and again i come back to if we are not putting thought into it what ar the result would we expect thank you for that anser i a very curious what constitutes negative effects of stimulant if somebod e's takin at ar all are riddlein in order to work longer hours or focus because they have attention deffis it but not necessarily iht ht and a gan i'm not recommending any one do thas i've just heard the numbers that have come back the least from surveys and discussions with collegs at stamford and elsewhere other college campses that upwards of seventy five per cent of college students use semi regularly these drugs off not by prescription just to study in to learn ye well i can imagine sleep issues because people because these are stimulants o what sorts of other issues can they curcreate for people problems le you afreit i think a touchstone maybe for that is running through our conversation in is prioratizing the short turn benefit over solving a long turn problem i wish we might say is a human tendency and and we see it across the topics that we are discussing short term use of stimulans sirt people ar more lert they can stay awake more they can study more intensely and longer okat theyr's some short tern benefit of that oer there even there there can be problems right there there but but we can we can say let less you say for sake of argument that in the short turn there'e something to be gain by doing that right but el my goodness tere much that is there'e much risk to that right and how many times if i seen some one who they are doing that and they are just doing that to study right and now they are addicted to the ampheta means and they are behavior change is and they do not know it talk about shifting our brain towards a more defensive ito sot o suspicious outward look you view of the world that we see a lot of that we see judgment in parament we see heighten levels of anxiety we see more impulsivity in decision making and and sometimes we it can get to the point of seeing frank pcychosis now that is not common but if i seen young people who have done exactly what you are describing re theye they are using they are using out or all of the using riddle in to study and then i see them when they are coming in to the hospital thee screaming about house some one's trying to hurt them boy then it is the worst case an ario but it shows that is where that can go and how much is there between that i'm just using it to study and that severe yo outcome that is actually quite negative for person and might change how they think about that friendship or that relationship right a lot negative happens when we change our brains without inability to see what is it actually doing to us o which is part of my my whole seem about truma right it changes our brains and we do not know it right well the same can be the same is often true of ampheta means used inappropriately thit shifts our brain and and we do not realize it we are a little t more impulsive in our decision making a little less trusting these are significant negative things that if we do not know it prersent will to say about oi'm jususing it to side amusing it to work more thit is not do that is not without it is high level of risk what your thoughts on canabus i've sait it many times on this pod cast yoefore i'll say yet i i've feel fortunea i've never really been attracted to alchol ar drugs of any kind am in in much that if all the alcohol and all the mariwana and all the cocanam fetemeian disappeared i i would not notice any change in my life right im and i feel lucky in that way cause i know a lot of people feel at im an attraction to these things at is almost a gravitational forse from their first drink if they just feel i once heard it described in this i i thing was a augustinborough's book dry or yous n alcoll he said that the first drink he had it felt this magic elicir that that mashed with the physiology of his blood in the most seemless way and as i was reanas i thought my goodness i' first of all that is hat must foreign a experience for me in terms of alcoll and second ash that must be terrible and and you can but at the same time you could really understand why some one would be drawn to that canabus now idays as a legal or decriminalized in many erras of h you ass a lot people seem to you see argument im it is not it is better than drinking im or they only do it for sleep or anxiety management im i'm not looking to demonize or support that the the canabus ar whane your thoughts about canabus for anxiety management depression and maybe even foradiatity for that matter sure if i could make it an alcoll commenti a the number of times i've seen alcohol having been a good idea for coping with something it approaches zera ithe the alchll for coping is just never good and there is an additional risk factor that there is certain genetic profiles where people respond strongly to alco as you'r saying it is not just o tis a little bit of short term relief of distress but there is as few foric response and those genetics we know we do not understand the completely they seem to be in northern european populations i more prevalent as you had west in northern euro we understand that where risk factors are demographically but we cannot pin point that for any one person and there is a tremendous risk of that i went when a person respond strongly to alcoll or habituates coping to alchol i'm canabus is a little bitof a different story you mean how i have seen that play out and en this is not coming from any expertees around the your the norphomachology oter houses really working in the brain it comes from an observation that what it seems to do is to narrow or attentional perspective rigt it is why people will say what they want et either when used canabus before watching a movi with friends or something right and and think look e i think why people are doing that is because a cognitiv spect from narrows and thend instead of worrying about that thing at work or that relationship is you one can just be present right for for it gates lt other attentional intrusions rigt in some ways i mean ave absolutely seen it be helpful to people mean's been legalized in organ a which is where my i spent a lot of my time in is is that where all of my practice is but at what i have seen is it is at times helpful save around sleep right because a peson can gate out other intrusive thoughts and they can just relax and go to sleep but there can be another side of that too that at higher levels of distress at higher levels of tension what it can do is narrow the focus of cognition to the thing that is negative i the idea that oo this is a treatment for yo depression anxiety troma is not true i can it be helpful under certain cercumstances iki think the answer to that is yet wan i know the answer that is yesterd i've seen it play out clinically that way but i can also be harmful too there again anything that has any power o power to influence our brains we wone to be thoughtful and careful about it men do i think that it is safer than alica hole yes i mean maythick we we clearly see that does that mean or just uniformly safe no i we want to be respectful of anything that can change how our brain is working and i think that includes certainly includes oucoand i think it certainly includes cantibist too i love to talk about psychodelics am for two reasons a one there seems to be a tremendous amount of interest in psychodelics as a theraputic clinical tool i know there is also recreational useonow just preface all this by saying that a my stance is a we absoltely know for surer that these are control substance as there illegal to possess cell or use an most of the country there few eris where it a theyare decriminalized am and psychadelix as a broad category of course and we can touch on some of the different different ones but whereas five years or five years ago or i was truly afraid to say the words psychodelics in any kind of public venue therre laboratories at stamford working on can a mean sylicibe and mdy m a mostly in animal models there is terrific work going on at johns hopkin school medicine and matthew johnson's lab and others looking at the clinical applications mainly of hido sylicid an analise d there is the maps trials of them dm a now it iys it is safe for an academic me to say the word psychodelics and i'm i'd love to approach this question of psychodelics from a place of af true exploration and curiosity but with the preface that a we are talking bout this ad in a legal clinical setting am and the legality is something that is now in process i do not think it is completed but the thus my understanding but there are trials there are you can go to clinical trials dot gov a and put in m d m a and you will see a bunch of clinical trials that ar are happening in the recruiting subjects a i think it is safe to have the conversation now and i'd love your thoughts about psycho d elics maybe we could start with a sylicibon and eleste as as a broad category of drugs hat least my understanding as they touch on mainly the ceratone and system some specific receptor activation and modulation tend to change notions of space and time ma just internal state may we would start there and theye a venture into some of the other one o what your thoughts on these drugs fors theraputec potential also potential hazards a et cetera thif we look at the trueh psychadelic sylicibon an elesty because cedemy an and m di ma they are different categories of medicine er these surtan novel tools to bring to bear but if we start with sylicibe and elesty true sychadelics i think why it is why they have gained much momentum over the last several years is because the data coming from the the labs in the academic centers is powerfully positive and its some one who is 'm interested in anything that is potentially helpful right and i want to learn and understand that because lot of things at arpotentially helpful you go and look at the dat and you see that that is not helpful it tit at's harmful i think what we have seen with psychadelics is that they are helpful right and and the trials were bearing that on of course these are used in professional hands and with the right kind of guidance ae extremely powerful tools but used in the right way by by some one who knows how to utilize them in the right set and setting can have an immense positive impact and that is why i think that that the thought is there a cross people and more and more people feel comfortable sang it and talking about it mean that were in the state of organ now where where the the thoughts were moving towards legalization of sylicibe and early in two thousand twenty three and it is part the new data right and how it meshes with the older data right how mesures with data from the sixties and seventies that showed such a strong powerful impact of these medicines and i've a whole set of thoughts about what is happening there and just their conjectures right but but my read of as best i can tryn t understand the narrow science and and and the clinical applicability in the changes is ou know what happens as we see less communication o less chatter in the outer parts of the brain writing the outer parts of the quartex and i think that as human beings we sot of glorify the parts of the brain that only we have i mean certainly n my growing up right what that i learn even if you think about gloring about the brain and high school right and learn that what work were great as humans cause we have language and other animals do not and we can use tools at are not we great because we have this part of the brain that other animals do not and it lefts us function right look ave ther's some truth to that right that that that we can do things others cannot do but we we get lost often in the outer parts of the qarte which i think are about survival rights o we come back to the things you and i talked about early on of whyre these troma mechanisms in us right sik much of what is going on on our brains is about survival and i think living to speak in the qartec right in the outer part of the brain is consistent with the focuss on survival if you think thats where language s as per vision is that is where executive function is planning an tacka task execution much of that is about making our way in the world around us we ten to glorify tha think whell that is in a sence where our existence is right and i believe that is not true right a a can can i say that for surely of course now right but my read of twenty years of doing clinical work and thinking about all sorts of medicines and and thinking about the psychadelics with a in the lot of depth i think that what they do is they take us out of the qartec right cause that is where we run into these problems that is where we bounce things over and over again that the distress centers deep in our brain in the brain stem kind of a ly with the outer parts of the qartex and they say ri were indistress we want to stay alive i kno often a lot of us of that trama that makes these changes in the brain then were thinking all the time agal would i do if if there were war what would i do if their civil wore r some one bonds us all i do if the if the economy collapseis right what will i do somebody get sick were we are thinking all this future projection that is all coming from a place of fear riht is all coming from a desire to think about things and control the future with this part of the brain that is uniquely human rigt and i think whene take the nerve transmission out of those places right and los sattered in a part of the brain and say the insoler qartex right the parts of the brain that a suit of in the middle right which which i think i believe is where our humaness really is the psychadelics make there be less chatter communication these other parts of the brain then we become seeted in the part of the brain thati i believe is most about our experience of true humanness which is why when you read about people who have experiences and i've heard about them people talk to me about this right that theye they utilize tat they talk with men whether it is some one telling me ther story or it is coming from research data iu know it is why people can to see with clarity that oh that trama t i think is not my fault e we feel a sense of compassion for ourselves we relieve ourselves release ourselves from guilt and nyou sink why is this helpful to people and i think it is because it can do what weare trying to get at in good therapy but it can really catalyze that bi just putting a person in that part of the brain that can see it for what it is without all that chatter in the qartex about i got i think its your father you w n't avoided again and and that makes the repetition compulsion how do i think a head to the next thing that might happen in what else bad might happen we do not get anywhere doing that nd i think where we get somewhere is when we seed ourselves deeper in the brain which i think we do if if doing really good therapyan were whe we are in the deep prts of the brain but these these psychadelics the medicinal value i believe is putting us in that part of the brain where person can really find truth and that is why i think that it is come far in these few years because ii think that is very clinically evident and i think we are going to see more and more the value of that and how what the psychadelics do can become i believe a huristic for understanding weight hower our brains really functioning and what are the parts that really matter to our experience of being human it is those parts of the brain my the deep parts of the brain the insolar cartex and and the areas around it that is ay light up when a person has and an experience of speritual ecstasy or an experience of connection with another person right to we we kind of have these tell tale marker is that something is going on there that is very important and very special and i think we are more attracted to the outer parts of the brain and parkers are easier to study right mean as you no better than i do we start ed studying the brain through lesion studies right gause is easy to er to see if i persnt got hur in this part of the brain or haw to stroke in that part of the brain what changes we look at the cartex ause one it is easier to study and we tend to glorify it and i think that has been misguided m and i think that we are learning how about how that is been misguided through the study of these no novel modalities from western perspectives would of course they been use for long long time in other cultures but novel from our perspective i'mfastening by this idea that the in these middle brain structures ays is where our humanity lies and and as you say i also wonder whether r not other animals experience life more from that orientation with less chatter wewe can only guess what am that the dog lover and and a being in the presence of th animals that seem to just be present and what is happening in their median embirnment not too much there is station rest i me sh but your tag about is sensions as important and excensions is extremely important and if we are goingto over value say language thand i think we under value sensiens right which is why i think we ten to under value animals right and and their suffering usin whe her not saying anything about it is right and not writing about it o it is easy to ignore and we think about gin the huberus of that right though because we can think an talk and rit we must be feeling more than then species that do not do that ame and i think iii think that is true and th we are gan to understand more about sensions and other species and how now that is at the core of existence am and my hope would be t at we value more humans and animals right through through the evolution of that understanding the hallucinations that accompany i'm psychodelics aelisty and sylicibon have such an attractive force to them as as a concept and and as an experience am and i think most often when people here hallucinagens they think of in psychodelics they think about halucinating right max sons why they wouldn' but what interesting in me as nothing in your answer about psychodelics acylisiban anelisty fokased on hallucinations per sa it was more about feeling states accessing a feeling state or a relation to an event or to a person or to ones self maybe then i i caught hints of maybe even empathy for one's selfe for the first time yet none of the adi to do with seen a seeng sounds or or a hearing collors and the another conicleche statements about im hallucination i am aware of laboratories wantit a universily california davis and particular but a few others that are trying to generate chemical variance of of of psychodelics that lack the hallucinagenic properties but maintain these other properties as the reputic tools and as i say that i realize that i a people in the psychodelic community i probably thinking all that is horrible that is a the dismantling of of the the coor thing but the simple question as do you think the halluinations are valuable for anything i think we are really getting into the into the philosophical right the untological rit tis thi sim trying to understand being i and i do not claim to know the answer to that i think that at times it seems the hallucinations have metaphorical or a symbolic am way of being helpful right because people will come to understand things that that they hold deer and true after the experience right that that often not always come through the lends of of the hallucination are the hallucinations necessary are these hallucinations sometimes important sometimes not may think we do not understand that and i think we want to be respectful of the of sit of mystery of that but what i think is fascinating is you thin that substance abuse and what that that means is be one aspect of that is that a person as experiences thoughts conceptions of self in the world with the substence that without the substance they know are wrong right vial talk lat eno lokuid courage right knowk gi feel better about myself and i feel courageous that've hat a couple of dranks now when i i after that i feel normal about myself and that that was false right and am we see that that is part of what substance intoxication means right but what we see with the psychodelic medicines is something that is incredibly different right that people are having experiences that are dee e linked for my normal experience of reality and then when they come into sens back on liin with i with in enormal cognitive way they real as a wil nomaplying all those mechanisms of trying to understand truth and to to that and what what i see is that it is true and wiw it is true a many we have tat all the time which tells me hey something different is going on there and of course these are powerful tool misused that very bad things can happen but you think about the clinical utility and what does it mean that many people change for the healthier or even change their lives after inexperience because it resignates is o now i understand something that is true and it is noll something bazaar is i was not responsible for being rated that time or no i know'm not less than even though my sectuality my gener identities different from some silly binary concent r tet teepe kind o cank often get it and they feel differently about themselves and guilt and shame are impacted i think we are likely to see that they are powerful anti trama mechanisms again used clinically in the right hands and and i think that we are also donto see that their heristic for understanding or brain that goes against what i see is some of the reflectsive huberis of well the outer parts must be the best because that is what makes us human and other animals do not have it and we are better because we are human a means makes a sense ou know i'd to talk about emdiama a and all prefaces by saying i was a participant i should technically i'm still a participant in a clinical trial i have experience of doing it twice athe a trial invols three sapradosings of this i was reluctant to do it outside of a clinical trial most because i was a aware there can be some cardiac of facts and i the ithe othere be a clinition on hand and am i'll just say that i found the experiences to be a profound am beneficial and very different from one am one session to the next the first one a felt am it a whole collection of of ideas and relationol things came up that felt very powerful and transformitive and i i do think that i learned there i exported a number of things my particular experienceis in relevant here but the second time i expected it to be the same way and it was very mellow and relaxing and was it was deeply tied to kind of a notions of acceptance there were not all these revelations and a wil new insihts it was very much about grounding into aa kind of a colmer state i have the the personal experience of a benefiting from these in ways i think still benefit me am and was very struck by the power of emdiama and my very crude understanding of the pharmacology in the state that is being under emdyamaze that itcourages are increases doplomanurgic transmission but also seretonergin transmission which is to mine o unch a kind of a rare state for the brain to be in then seppically it is more of a see saof dopen menurgic drive towards external goals when more seratonergic drive towards am more placidy ty r comfort with what one already has and with both those systems amplified i the only way i can described it subjectively is that t everythng sort of funnel back in and it was almost a pursuit of inner landscape aand i can only imagine what it would be in the contects of of doing this with somebody else also taking em dia man iave no idea what that is that is my report of the experience i know that these burns can bary what it what are your thoughts about the the chamistry and the what what sorts of states do you think emdiamais creating that can a explain why it is a useful therapeutic tool in some cases and an what sorts of cases those might be sou're youre the declever think part of what we are starting with is is that this is very different than the psychadelics right which are seeting our consciousness in these deep centers of the brain right where is what empd ma is doing is sort of flooding with positive ner transmitters right in certain parts of the brain and i think what that creates is a greater tremissiveness inside to entertain or proach different things right the i think where we see its tremend my readof the data is around potentially and and were seeing in some of the trials ri tremendous benefit for trama right nyo think about what we are talking about earlier how this rrflective guilt shame hyper vigilance avoidance right and when these systems are are flooded with these near transmitters it is more permissive jus think about that rightin to think about that without again all the chatter of that your fault or you never ging to get anywhere because of that or wit that means or ria that the ccatica way and then we can think about it in a way it is not through the lends of fear right and i think that is the power there is that it is permissive of approaching something contemplating something a differ a novelty wou sowtabout a d novo approach and i think that is also why the experience convary because you could also see how if you are not thinking about something right there is not a clinical guidance to it you could you could be in a state whele i had just feel good right in i'm thinking about good things and li that can feel good right but it but that is not necessarily problem solving right the clinical guidance ays it let us take that state and do something with it right let us it now that tere in the state let us hate let us make hable the sun is dining regory in a state where we can look at things that are tramatic right we can approach them from a denoof a perspective and i think it is part i think that explains wla you had these different experiences from one to the other because your brain is just in a state that is conducive to something right but if there is not that the the mechanism to have that thing happened conducive to something ferypeutic then you might go there on your own or you might just be in a state re of a sense of well being and and you sit with it which sort of seems a waste to me andand this is what i tell people when they ask about emdy am a is it i said at least from my experience that that the potential hazard there is that in that very high dope oman urgic sert an urgic state a there were moments where i felt i could get excited about any one specific concept that i might even just think about for instance a water and how nourishing it is and really just go down the path of water in the world and all the water and d you can you aren'n a aa state that is very prone to suggestion yes internal suggestion and the guidance turned out that guidance from the clinition turned out to be immensely valuable in allowing me to go into my own heads for a bits of time but then also to resurface in and sharer an exchanged in a way that to i'm trying really get something out of it that was useful an that i could export because if course water is wonderful but i'm not really interesting growing my relationship to water a and i really thought i can i could understand for tht i never went to raves or anything growing up and ever did emdy i may recreationally but i i understood for the first time how people could get really attached to an environment and feel connected to things because i think with ll that caritonin you just feel connected to everything around you i i think it is it is a slippery slope the're anand i do not know what the future of the clenical use of emdyi may looks but i would hope that whoever shing about i'm guiding these sestions is really thinking carefully also about envolving the practice to help people really move through in a sequenchay they can leave with something valuable yes one hundred per cent and one hundred percent these are such powerful tools and if they are powerful tools were using thand without respect for that right without clinical guidance we incur risk iment you getting of absess with water while on a probably is not in o hurt you right but if someone is out you using it is around other people what one can feel positively about o becomes to to obsessed and assure turn about can be very counter productive or ther can be a lot of risk to that i think it t it it anchors back to these are very powerful tools were coming to understand them much much more and we are coming to understand that they have immense potential to be helpful tus but i think and hope that that only also increases our respect for those motalities and what can come what negative can happen if we are if we are not respectful this can be very interesting to see where all of this gos in the next f year is not just in oregon but elsewhere it is a one way or another it is happening it seems to have a momentum that is not going to stop i'm very exciting area i to be sure legory i have a question about language i'm in your book you talk about how we need to be careful about the use of language around trama it may be problem solving an problem describing in general ye at one extreme you hear that u your brain in your body hear every word you say and we have to be careful with language and that i shauldy frighten me for a number of years cause i would hear that i thought gosh if i just think that something is bad now it is goin to hurt me worse which himself is part of that whole e packing down of an issue u very hard to avoid thoughts without distraction a that is one extreme on the other hand i i can say i can tell somebody i love them u with a tone of hatred i can tell somebody i hate them with a tone of love how shaull we think about language in parsing trama and in your book you talk about em you give some cautionary notes about talking about depression trama and ptst in terms that that might diminish their real severity in some cases and an i was really struck by that s may you just touch on how should we talk about these things in a way that does not diminish them for ourselves or for other people and at the same time honoris the fact that there is a lot of trama out there and u there is a lot of depression out there and and we need to talk about it ye i think this a very complicated and many ways convolluted topic tat i think it it is wonderful that we have language but boy language leads us a stray often too he think about how we how people define words what what some one says a word was it doesnat perthen know what that word means and what new ants are they taking from it that we saive to be very careful what we are saying in what we are communicating and i think this does not mean because ir there is a sit of phenomenon now were were people are trying to control language i think to much you cannot say anything that someone else might find hurtfully if to refer to people in ways they choose to be referred to even if those are ways that others do not understand or ways they themselves have decided were ways that might bepsychologically or clinically unhelpful i think the over control of language is not good but i think this specificity of language of what are we trying to say how are we definding it even the word trama wher we are talking about tromise we wanted to find what that means right it does not just mean anything kind of negative right because tin that deludes it down to meaning nothing right it also does not just mean i know injury in combat rightly we have to talk about what that is i think anchoring it to something that rises to the magnitude of overwhelming our coping skills and changing us then at least i define it that way and i can communicate that to you and we can an understand we are talking about it i think that another aspect of language while again we need this middle ground and i do not think that it is oc for the over control of language to shut down expression but we also have to acknowledge how wwe are much less distance from each other through s ocial media and think social meeding can do very very good things is hopefully we are doing now right but it can also be used to harm people from a distance right and how much hatefulness is there out there tha think comes from anger and frustration in people gond back to troma right for people just want to be angry and it is not really issues of their talking about but then there is a target of that anger and and you no people feel beleagered by that and ththe words hat people use sometimes are awful that some one reading that look if you are in the demographic it is being targeted right in your reading that meand how is a person not feel you not feel am be set upon vunerable right and then i think that also fuels things that we just had this is terrible shooting in buffalo right legousty hate motivated right and i think that because that kind of language becomes very real to people who may take it in it fuels their hate and then they do something to enact it which of course creates greater feeling vont fear and vonerability and i think there was some civility and decorum that was in our world not that long ago right i mean yom in my early fifties om not that old right but i remember a time when when in political discourse thay people were civil to one another right now much and i's not all of it right but there is an acceptance of things that are just bombastic right thase that it is a circus side show sometimes of of your people being just angry and aggressive and and it is not really link to anything athots a legedly link to something but and other people's anger can attach to it and it is not about what it is about but it is about alying with the anger and and i think that there is much damage that comes from that and and i think you should we have should it be oke that people sometimes are talking communicating using language in ways that would get us suspended from middle school right ways i do not want my eight year old to see mean is that really oke or doi ny to take a stand for rational use of language i do not want my use of language to be over control by some one who thinks they soid understand better than the rest of us how to communicate with us ic i do not want that whats steratypically a sort of a idea of the left sa right at least in our society but i also do not want language can be angry and aggressive that it is perpetuating or spreading voneability and that it facilitates tromum and and i think we could set standars as a society for we say look i do not i do not want anybody in power whos who is ging to behave that way right i do not care if their whol agendi is make palconti's life better i'm much in vote for you right if you are behaving towards others in a way that is denegrating you'r behaving in a way that i feel is i sens ashamed of right and and i feel that a loter i see the politics you i see things play outs not always political of course not always pol but i see things play out i think o my gosh i feel embarrass we were were somehow who came with this whit does not matter which side of the political spect from its coming to and i think that is an indicator that what were doing is really hurtful t us people become more angry they attached to the anger im people feel more beleger there is more divisions between us hand it seems more and more whal we can only really identify with people who are just us what at really mean men th the divisions that it creates between us and and that you now that promotes many negative things ridio men thing byt ways in which it promotes white supremacy ra jus one example i and weve seen that play out that this is really bad for us and we have got a look at that and if we do not look at that i do not thinkas i something is going to happen something is happening ighit is happening now and 'm i it really to my mind it really sheeps down into the soil of everything that we are talking about on all sides yes people are activated people are are upset about one thing wor the other i li not no one is a mun from upset regardless of political offiliation and i everybody seems to be upset nowadays and i im as i was hearing you talk about this i i feel lot of residence with what what you said and i also hoping you run for office of the gif the gumption for that but that but thank you wel em te wonderful iyou i'd to talk about a concept of taking care of oneself this comes up in the book yeim this is only we talk a lot about on this podcast i mean i think people have heard me blab endlessly an ol probably go into the grave telling people to get sunlight in their eyes when they can and to try and get proper sleep an to have a few tools for im reducing their anxiety in real time and and on and on and on i we hear about this concept of taking care of oneself and and i think a at a surflevel im it can sound a little bit o take care take care take good care we im but to me it is a deep and powerful concest and i was very happy to see it in your book and also to learn a lot of of ideas about what that really looks im because whether or not somebody is in the early stages of considering whether not they have trama ors in the deep stages of working that through or as made it through the tunnel some distance taking one care of oneself as an on going process im i'd leve fou to just describe what taking care of oneself means to you as a clinition and of course the practiceis in things that you encourage people to do but but how wish how shall we think about taking care of oneself because on one extreme weu can imagine a missaghes retreats vacations and i shefts for hirer that take care of everything for ourselves i'm and on the other extreme you could say leaning in to life in a way that youre paying attention to small things while working very very hard i'm it is such a big concept but ho how do you thing about taking care of oneself how should i take care jyself how should people take care of themselves sur i see here what i think it is a very fascinating dicotomy right that in some ways i think of how complex our brains are right how complex are psyches are unconscious minds are there' much complexity there but on the other hand psychological concepts that are con sistent with health are often very simple right wish i wish i do not mean light right wet but but simple straightforward right and an thing self care is absolutely one of them i mean how much is talk about how to take care of oneself that just skips over the basics that are necessary is a building block for all else or t does not matter how many chaps are vacations or whatever a person has if the basics of self careoarand squared away and it is not a concept to say lik look are you sleeping enough right are you eating well are you getting natural ligft are you interacting with people who are good to interact with right are you excepting negative interactions in your life are you living in circumstances that make you feel o ka or not thither very very basic premises but often we are not looking at them at all right were not looking at them at all because we tend to skip over them and we tend to skip over them either because again in some automatic way that sometimes as troma driven oore nuck in ta look at that right and often not taking care of ourselves can have the punishment distraction a n raitheres much that can come into that or our sense of power is is tie to not taking care of ourselves me ni an exampleis i tend to for whatever reason do reasonably well i'm with very poor self care right and that was very adapt if when i was intomedical training ini i go i can i can eat a loft to day i can naughty right i can sleep two hours i can sleep ade right i mean over all that is not good and it has not been good for me as i've aged but then i i realize som bolook i'm doing all these things that make myself healthier but what i ignore that right and why am i ignoring that was a cuc why am i ignoring it because somewhere inside of me is it was and still to some extent is this idea that my ability to be really functionol right to generate success in the world around me is tie to my ability to do that right that all fi but if i stop doing that an ow im meeting and sleeping regularly than can to lose some edge and n even i think about us all the time but iave a realize hay i'm also i'm not doing it inside and and i think it is really grounding to the basics i'm that really helpless of what are the basics of what i'm doing and not doing in my life diet exercise slee people circu mstances leisure activities an mean sunlight i think immensely important and dramatically undervalued whi want a thank you for that and i will not a thank you for to day's discussion ie found it to be incredibly informative and i know our listeners will also i also ont a thank you for the work you do i mean you opsly run and incredibly a robus clinical practice that i'm aware that your

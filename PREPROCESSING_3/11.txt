well folks the attempts to take down donald trump are very very real and thei are having significant consequences for of the body politic their coming from nearly every major institution in the united states from our universities to the media from academia to the judiciary as well talk about it is happening everywhere and the real question is why is this really about donald trump as a person is it realy about donald trump with all of his myriad foyblls and mistakes and craziness as or is it about something broader i will contend that it is about something broader that the elete institutions in our society have basically decided that if any one remotely right wing were to ever enter the presidency again would be an existential threats to their vision of utopian future for the united states the reason i say this is because this wecan marked president sday ave an entire episode of facts up at youtu the can you write now about the borst presidents of all time and what you will see in art lists is that it goes all the way back and all the way ford and it really tries to take look at what people did while they were president and the impacts of those things while they were president and sometimes as jimmy corter in thir post presidency but historians every year is on his big story about the presidential rankings the overall presidential greatness rankings from the american political science association and what this list does is demonstrates who they thing was the best and who they think was the worst obviously teyavetrumpin last place of course of course and youuld assume that they would but that does not really answer the question as to whether they just hate trump or whether there is something broader going on to truly understand how much the lete institutions hate trump and really hate the wright wing yeft understand that it is not just that they hate trump is that they despise any one who smacs in any way of being on the right in the united states in trump is just the apotheostas of all of those things eajus the apepacts of all the things that they hate because they are able to stack up all of those myriad craziness is and foyblls of donald trump on top of all the other things that they hate about republicans f you look at their list their list is stacked top to bottom with demograts every republican is down grated significantly every democrat is up grated significantly here is the list from the american political science association of their top presidents they have abraham lincoln an number one obviously consents is numb one pick now usual consent to pick is abraham lincon umber one and george washington number to sometimes you the other way george washington number one inabraham lincoln number to but those are always the top to but not for the american political science association they have lincoln at number one and then the have franklin delino roosevelt to nmber to which is pretty astonishing considering tat franklin dellinor rosevelt presided over the grat depression he pobably lengthened it by nearly a decade with his garbage economic policies frankill and dellinote roosevelt initiated many of the vast government overspending programs that if crippled america and created of vast wellfair state that is led to a thirty for trillian dollar national dat in other words there are some good things that af the are ded for example his leadership during world wor too even tha even that was played by some bad leadership dessitions particularly with regard to say the yalta agreement which seeted all of eastern europe to the soviets after are had a bazar soff spot for stallen in any case putting him number to above george washington is the tell but dosn'n end there the put tetdyroosevelt at nmber four teddy rosevelt of course was a progressive tany rosevelt was a believer in the power of big government even though he was a republican and the republican and democratic parties have shifted identities somewhat over the course of time the but thomas jefferson at number five harry truemen at numer six and boroc obama an number seven there is no possible way to say the barokobama is the seventh best president of all time the seventh greatest president of all time clocking in above dwit d eisenhower james madison john adams ronald regen and everyone else that is insane barockobama was a terrible president barockobama wildly exascerbated racial divisions in the united states of america by every available polling statistic he presided over the complete dissolution of american power around the world he down greated the american military heu rect us in the forein sphere and domestically he pullorised america no president of my lifetime bar non not cest on issues of race but also on issues of culture on issues of say sextual mores we moves from a country wherein two thousidnt a barokabama campaign as a proponent of traditional marriage to by the time he left office open discussions about whether men are women that is what borackobomaded besides presiding over the worst recovery from a serious economic recession in american history the slowest recovery in american history and he spent more money than literally all prior presidents combined t did barokobama they have him at number seven on this list and then ev l b ja who initiated the great society programs the're spent public thirteen trillian dollars on anti poverty programs to leave almost precisely the same percentage of americans and poverty they have him ranked at number nine the guy who wast the ve at nom war and got us involved in at the first place the guy who completely rewrote the constitutional relationship between the government and the private american citizen tatgey is at number nine bill quinton is at number twelve as though joe bidon is at number fourteen hon this list from the american political signed sociation how in the world is jobd in ranked nmber fourteen ronads ragon is rank number sixteen toronald regen who led the most booming economic recovery in modern american history in the nineteen eighties and also created the ground work for defeating the sovia union thatguy is ranked thatguy is ranked at number sixteen and jobidon is ranktot number fourteen by these people wurdro wilson the worst president of all time a vicious rasist who let us into world were one who then created the system that let us in the world wore to who jailed his political opponents for sedission wudro wilson a truly horrify who created the burocratic state the worst president of all time they have thatguy ranked above ronald ragan tho the reason that i'm reading this is because youove to understand the framework by which our elete institution's work and because of that framework hy are lettin to both a bazar delusion that they cannot possibly lose to somebody donald trump and also they are led to believe that they can do anything they want to stoped onald trumpie's after all if ou have the fourteenth greatest president of all time according to the people running against literally ve worst president of all time well i mean what cannot you do to stop that president of the united states what cannot you do to stop donald trump we at' to more on this in just one second first do ou know big tack can big government havein common they both would to silence to senting voices into

ben to get three months for free that is express vpns ot com slash ben in the realm of delusion nate silver has ben taking it directly on the chin over the weekan becaud because the poll analist put up a piece pointing out that jobdon is extremely vulnerable in his reelect effort he says quote if you would asked me a year ago i would ave told you that jobidon was a reasonably clear favorite in the event of a rematch against donald trump not overwhelming favorite mind you but perhaps o sixty five thirty five favorite the case forbidn seemed obvious enough and come inswin reelection more often than non of course bid an bee trump in twenty twenty democrats will coming ff a relatively strong mid trum i do not but grudge people who took thir time to realize that bidon's reelection would be a heavy lift the first time mi in turnal the will began to shift was in late summer when bidon's approval mumbers remain poor even as the economy was improving and it was becoming more apparent that his advanced t age was an enormous probem for voters and one democrats were not going to be able to spin away since then biden's situation has to come considerably worse if youare ten year's younger you might still be a sixty five thirty five favorite says nate silver but if his campaign is substantially en cumbered by his age he is probably now the under dog he says you gos nee to stop being delusional and he goes through the stats and he points out that jobidon has a real problem in his reelect effort which is why you are sing people ranging from nate silver to as recline neither of whom its exactly republican calling for jobiden stepaside and he is getting wallupd by the left to day because it is not possible for jobidn to lose thout simply be impossible this is why they are till trotting out amy clobachar the senator from minisota to claim that jobidnis all mentally well when we can clearly see that he is not here'is ami clubachar over the weeken i was on a eir first one with the presan going for minc ote to i wis con an for going from wachin tan te tetor with conen for an interest structure project and i was with the president for over an hour and talked about many thing te mastic an ternatio he was fokes his re colis good it was the fame experienc that my colic had who tout with him for hours temo cretan me cublican about the mid tonly a few weeks ago he is totally vine acoring t emy clubtrare and here donot continue to maintain this because again if you believe thae jobidonis the fourteenth ratis president of all time and the brogabom was number seven thend how is it possible for jobidon to lose to donald trump but teem biden does realize that there is some badpolling numbers for him and he is now going to try to pull off a reset according to acios they see his state of the union address is a big public recet moments or god luck with that i've seen a lawd a state of the unions over my time watching politics which is several decates at this point and lemjosy there has never been a state of the union that acted as an actual reset for a president there been good ones and the'e been bad ones it rarely acts as a signal moment a bot theyre gon to tri to relaunch jobidon good luck with that they are launching the blackberry again ins the midle of the iphone market according to axios many tope democrats are convinced that if the election were held to day jobin would lose a rematch with former presen and trump bidon's state of the union address is probably going to future some interesting moves including for example an attempt to change the debate with regard to imigration jobidon is now considering an executive order on emigration that would effectively try to prevent more mass imigration into the united states he is goin to do this just before the election an attempt to take the issue off the table now there is a pretty significant problem with that which is of course that is a tacit admission that he coul have done that all along but again jobidon is realizeing that he is vulnerable and sonalst denmocrat even though thy really do not want to believe it and again because this is a battle of good for sis evil according to democrats that means it is time to break glass in case emergency the emergency is here andthe are now breaking the glass and that means that theyare inletion all the hounds of hol on donald trump not just with regard to the criminal legal cases against him but of course last week we saw in insane fine levied by judge arthur an gron against donald trumps at business the trump organization this an insane judgment if this judgment his three hundred and fifty four million dollars and damages just to rekep what this case was the accusation by attorney general of the state of new york litish james was the donald trump fhraugulently infleeted his real estate holdings in an attempt to gain loans from private actors there is no alligation that donald trump did not pay back thos lones there is no alligation by the tpeople who actually gave the loans that donald trump ought to be prosecuted there you have a case against him becaue they did not suffer any damages this is basically the same thing as if you went to alender and you suggested that rehouse was with more than it actually is worth and they did not bother to do in a prasal or they did not a prasl and teir prasel came back and it was keno within margin of error or at least it was high enough a they decid enl what booming market wilthrow the lonat you anyway and then later the state came back at you ind decided to fine you for a high multipoe of whatever the lone was according to enbisynews the judg who presided over the civil business fraudtrile against trump on friday orderd the former president his sons at business associates and company to pay more than three hundred and fifty million dollars in damages and temporarily limited their ability to do business in new york and grun of course had precept this thing wos perfectly obvious from the get goasion is this trial laid out he said trump is guilty and i was just a question of how much money he is going to force trump to pay according to new york atterny generalitish james they said that with pre judgment interest that judgment totals over four hundred and fifty million dollars and in order for trump to appeal yes to come up that money that is th why the process works in new york it is not as tough you get to hold that money in a bance pendin an a peal in appeal you wouldimagine wutd and with the overturning of this particular insane verdict remember no damages were aledge is a bazar statute in which the state of new york can charge you with fraud not criminally civilly which requires a different standard of evidence criminalles beyond a reasonable doubt civily is preponderance of the evidence which means they just have to show bi a majority of the evidence the donald trump was fraudulant about his real estate holdingcs and then they can find him four hundred and fifty million dollars based on vero damages which is obviously an attempt to bankrupt him it is obviously an attempt to make him non liquid in advance of the election make him liquid ate his assets crating an about another bunch of hedlines create lack of cash low for hims we cannot actually defend himself in criminal cases around the country it is an absurd absurd attempt what should being legal attempt we it is a more on this in just one second first i've been talking bout my helics mattress for years i've had that heliksly mattress or o nowuld decated this

out comslesh man use code he looks partn er twenty five the ruling also bars trumpit his company from even applying fr any bank lones for for three yoar he cannot even get a bond for this thing a normal firstwell whos can give a bond in the the am out of four hundred fifty million dollars normally when you ye get charged with something or ife to ome with the money you' get a bond the bond is re payable in a certain period of time andyou'r talking about you o ten grand and i' talk about four hundred fifty million dollars when you'r entire business organization has been voided for doing business in its home state for three years which means he is goin to have to come up with a bunch of money obviously an grun also ordered the continued appointment of an independent monor and the instullation of an independent a recor of compliance for the company trump called it in illegal un american judgement against me my family and my tremendous business he said the decision is a complete antotalsham that of course is true his sons were also ordered to pay four million dollars a piece it also bars them fom running the company hat's obviously what this is about and by the way this is stacked a top the judgement in favor of egn carol the least credible witness of all time probably in the amount of eighty three million dollars civil trials where donald trump now oes money amount to well over half a billion dollars all of that initiated since he lost the presidency in november of twenty twenty this is of course in insane judgment it is clearly political as the walsterturnal editorial board points out they say that this is using a hell fire missile to a nnihilate a shop lifter there was no real financial victim lutitia james campaign for office promising to find trum guilty of comphing and well this is initiating a lot of onst and some blow back there are a m there r bunch people woare suggesting that they are going to initiate travel boy cott of new york there was a call by one person omline for an attempt by truckers not to ship their goods into the city of new york that seems to hae fallin a part here it is this person calls him olf chicago ray he put

tromor pe an yoili trumke ttro that eh will there be civil disobediencs an he says no right but you could see something more likelywer gnana se happenings every business person in new york whos remotely affiliated with any republican positions can uppll thei money if you are living in new york right now and youare affiliated with the trump campaign an anyway to give money to the trump campaign you are in a rush down to florida as fast as humenly possible you areabout to see a money drain in the state of new york that is gon to make the last few years pale in comparison beause if you believe you can live in new york and not have your property expropriated by a judge for what is kind of normal real estate business wheeling and dealing that operates round the edges in new york must be real about how realist it operate to new york wy exactly you stick around in new york for all of that meanwhile federal agencies the alled deep state they are attempting to insulate thei'r own regulations against the possibility that trump becomes president again now this is the problem ith the burocratic state in a shated by wider wilson oyou have basely an independent body of regulators who work for the democratic party and who are just going to ignore whatever trump tries to do now at trump is pledging to do is these pledging to bring them under the umbrella a federal law that lows him to fire people and he totally should he absolution if you comes president of the united states regulators for are tempting to inshrine in law permanently regulations that out live jo bidon those people should be fired immediately don trump is right about that theyre doing their damedus to try ind thwart trump should he become president according to politico president jobiaens allies are getting ancy about his idministrations pile up of unfinished invironmental rules bydns agencies are facing a deadline the spring to finish some of the most important regulations to insure a republican congress in whitehouse can not erase them next year complicating matters is the fact that the dedline will not be known until months after the rules are completed now how 's that even legal how is it legal for them to right regulations that are unrepealable by congress in the president of the united states is theire's in is there an independent body in the constitution of th united states that is allowed to create revyou free regulations that bined all of us without the in put up yunote thei'r bloss the president or they are boss the congress that is insaine but they are openly reporting that the regulatory state is attempting to inshrine and law all of these regulations to avoid donald trump's presidency that is of their attempting to do again because this is a fight against evil according to these people and they will use any means at their disposal meanwhile obviously on the foreign front things are falling ing to absolute sheer chaos tan it is chaos on all sides and it is really quite hideous donald trump put out a statement over the week end on the death of nevalney alect in of alnhese all lexs are not nevolney of course was almost certainly murdered by the gremlin he was wafteror he was attempted that they tried to kill him back in twenty twenty one when they tried to kill him and failed then they then arrested him he came back to russia they arrested im immediately the a methirtier sentence they sent him to the goolog and then they almost certainly murdered him in t the the curn contemporaneous reports coming ou suggest then nevalneys had body had

pressrelies was issued by the prison two minutes after his death was supposed to have taken place two minutes and seven mntes later the crumlin spokesman demethree pescov was addressing in the

formed of vol ney had died at ten a m which is before the officially recorded death time of two seventeen p m han they described how unknown vehicles ha arrived at the prison the that before none of this should be particularly surprising these again just a few years ago they attempted to poison him ith a nerve agent called movichock not only was this well documented the documentry an ah fe o ther can watch nevalny actually documents alecin avalny witerally calling up the people who tried to poison him and asking them what they did he pretends tha hese working for the government yo ask them they just tell him straight up that they poison is underwear and the they hope that that would make it into his mouth bet dring a water bottle or something and that that is exactly what happen almost died local parametics have told opposition out that novia gas hat the europa than if almly's body is currently being held at a different facility in the same area as the prison they stillve not turned it over the're not turning it over presumably because there will be signs of actural murder on him yulia nevalnia who is his wife she sait her lates husband body is being hidden these their waiting for traces of yet another of puttin's novachock to disappear anov a chuck is a chemical nerve agion that kills you and then eventual lya the scigns of it wear off in the body the russian government thought it had worn off in the body and then the germans were able toactually detected last time they use nofa chuck against navalney aso donald trum then put out a comments on nevalney after several days of not tang anything a he said the sudden death of electing ofvolney has made me more and more aware of what is happening in our country when is a slow steady progression with crooked radical left politicions prosecutors and judges leading us down a path to destruction open borders riggdilections grossly on feir cort from decisions are destroying america where a nation an decline o failing nation magot twenty twenty four it is there a few things to be said about this one the last half whre he talks about the decline of the country and the militerization of the justice department militerization wof our judicial system all of that parts true it is totally wrong for donald trump to compare that to the judicial a rainment a rest without process that ywo process about real charges jailing and murder of ladimerapoutent's political opponents and i's wrong for two reasons one it suggest that the state of play in the united states is similar to the state of play in russia which degrades the united states things are bad th nited states thate nearly as bad as they are in russia that is a difference in kind and we should recognize that because again many of these probins are fixible with say elections or say with moving or say with impeachments bad judges it the same is not true remotely in russia since it is probamatics compare america o russia for two reasons one it degrades the actual stay o play in the united states when you hear journalists traveling abroad and de crying the state of censorship in the united states in russia where they literally kill the dicidents that is a bad look is not true a but it also happens to down grade the scale of what is happening in russia the state of evil that is happening in russia and vladimer pooten is in fact a corruptdictator a now thy become unpopular to say inds some circls i do not know why you can even make the case against american involvein n ou crane without talking up pooten but then again i suppose you camp because here is the thing it is in america's interest to watch america's geo political rivals down graded in terms of military capacity it is not in america's interest to watch those geo political rivals gobbal up large segments of the globe in terms of territory and population that have control over things grain and oil making a real politic case for why the united states should basically acquiess in russian military land grabs that is a very difficult case to make the only case that you are left making is effectively that russia is not that bab here that you crane is worse or what ever it is the probalms russia is kind of that bad if you onto make the case that america does not have the geo political interest ing ucrane make that case but many of the people who are making that case are not really making thatcase they are making abroader case which that russia is not that bad that somehow pooten is a guardian of christianity or pooten is a is a a defender of of western values against secular liberalism that is not what ladimer pouten is vladmer pooten is a proponent of russian greatness russian greatness is largely basistorically speaking on russian land control thatas been true for literally hundreds of years that is it bedlay pouten we will say that himself in his interview with tuckercarlsin for example he literally spent the first thirty five minutes explaining the history of of russia's control of land at no point did you talk about wuon qote be spread of russian values or the im portance of christianity in fact when tuck or try to prompt him on that gashy doge the question let us talk about what is in america's interests at this point with regard to russiam woup when what russas actually doing at russias attempting to do on a foreign policy level is sort of recreate the red green brown alliance back at the outset of world wher two teire effectively was a red green brown alliance n that allionce is in the notsees an the soviets and these lamas because people forget about this but these lamas wore working the entire second world war effectively with the notes ha the new attempt by russia is to recreate that internationally and with some help from domestic friends in in other countryes what that means is that in this particular vision russia ashuay is not red the reds would be marxists people on the far left to believe that the west is in a farious force in the world that everything bad that is been happening the world is some sort of weir blow back to america and those people have advocated for americas an mes for a very very long times o be burny sanders who suggest that everything that happens in america is what is been driving places elsewhere and we we ought to withdraw from the world because its better for the world for america not to be involved an other parts of theworld americas in a farious hawards in force in the world they are joined by some people on the on the right who have sort of horse you theoryed this thing or america is really really bad and again american forein policy is responsible for all the blow back that has happene over the course of times o have sortof this horse shooe theory they can putant sort of the red category then you of the greens those who be the aslamas let be people the mollas in aron or commas or palcinins lomachy hod or bussharsod or the hoothies those groups our allied with the marks as this is why you sees say queers for palistine marching in the lest for example and then you have the brounds the brounds would be people ladmerpouten who actually is a fasios lanerpouten is not a communists his country is wron a fasiostoligarchy if a thirteen per cent flatsacts but in order to own property and have your property be secure you have to be an ally of vidictator which is the way that it works over their china by the way is in sort of the same category china is sort of ticture lotally communusts but they'r more facious than they are communsts considering tht hey've alowed large slaths of marked activity inside the countries they are more corporatest at this point than they are actually communist this anti american alliance is what ladmerpouten is actually pursuing at this when you can see it cropping up all over the globe get's more on this in just a moment first our friends i ziprgroter conducted a recent survey they found the

democracy accordig to the american left in brazil over the week end he literally said onoval tese daftcuot i'm notkon tn jump to conclusions let us see what the doctor say was the citizen sick it is the case of the passenger who died on the plan coming to etheopia who are we going to blame lula is covering fur nofvaney at the same exact time by the way heis also covering for cmmass we should point that out in fact over the week end lula said that israel is kitler and came out in fullscale te fence of comms sere he was over the weekend and by theway theyve now withdrawn their ambassador brazil has from israel here he is said what as happening in the gozistri and whith the palstinian people does not exist at any other historical moment in fact thit existed when hitler diside it is kill the jews fullskal antismatic language here right the iddea is that the jews are in the new hitlers and the palstinians who initiated the murderous rage fast in which they killed twelve hundred is rally citizens th still holding a hundred is raily citizens under ground in gaza right now commas could surrender tomorrow they are not obviously lula is upholding the alliance with comas with

tat eleast the have ben a liance with aron for example theveen a liance with comas and palstinian is lomachy hod over the week end in fact commas was in vited by russia to visit according to the jerusalem post palsinian authority prim minister mohommed stya said over the weeken russ invited palsinian factions to meet in moscow at some point in late february mascow has already hosted a comastelegation in october an october that comas elegation wich was led by senior comas member musa abumarzuk mat with the russian and aranian deputyforn ministers mhil bogdanov and alibageri kani that meating re presented a convening of interest between russia eran and comass the relationship between russia and terras grups in the midliest is quite real obviously and then you have the left in europe which is backing those interests as well for example you have josup a borrell who ise the head of e forn policy who says that israel should stop attack in comas naw because commass is really more of an idea as posuno a terra group he said quote comass is an idea you do not kill an idea ou ave to provide an alternative that is better which of course is absurd men natism was also an idea and then american antalas killed a bleep load of natis obviously meanwhile aran is on the move as well over the weeken eron actually destroyed the hothees which arnaranian osued sank a british ship in the red sea according toe winat news vieucases meritime at trade operations agentsy reported on monday the whoothes sunk a ship travelling in the red sea sath of the port sity of mukha an yemman it is the first time at since israel's war on commass that a crew had to abandon their ship because of th hothies meanwhile by the way the united states had to strike five hoothy targets in yemin including an under water drone tht's acnology is coming from the aranians of course or working with the russians according to the newr times the united states struck five hoothy military targets including an understy drone and who the controlled areas of yemanon saturday according to the s military that is the first time aron back to these had employed such weapon since they began in their campaign against ships in the red sea was an unmanned under water vessel but the hothies are receiving much of the tacnology directly from eran of course the formation of this entiri koalitian which has happened under the auspecies of jobidon is incredibly dangerous to america's interests the solution to that is not to down play what russia is in the world the solution to that is to face up to what russia is in the world and to muscularly protect america's interests around the glub asmean war everywhere it does mean that america does certainly have an interest insa free shipping across the world wherever the cost is of the ukran war it is significantly less than what happens to freedom of the seas decreases to the point where every ship is avoiding the red sea and the suas canal completely

afkanastan to the eighth century thugs were the calaban and now's a turns out un surprising le remember that time that jobidon said that alkito would never be an afkanis tan again that we had achieved our purposes a spoil or lert they are nafganistan agan according to the jerusalem post the alkita terrorist organization is having a resurgeon in afganistan under the ruling taliban setting up eight new training camps alongside five ma drasas is lomic educational institutions around the country that is a report from the uan security council from january the report said the training camps are located in verious provinces including cosney lachman parwan an rusgun thall solicited sites yosed balkita to move its operatives in and out of neighboring oron and said that a new base to stock pa weapon ry has been establish in the ponshure valley north of the capital of cabl again what we are watching in real time is a in a lines of convenience in russia in china and it is including eron and those countries ider seeking to make common cause with left winge countries in south america and in afri ca as well to create effectively in anti american block that is what has happening in real time that is been led off by the era of jobidon surrender laden politics there is a lot of attempt er by the way to pass this off as the result of trump but let us be real about this a ron was fairly contained while donald trump was president of the united states they are quite fearful russia was fairly contained while donal trump was president of the united states they were fearful if not of his reteric then of his un predictability china was not exactly certain what donal trump was going to but they are perfectly certain of what jobidon is going to do and that is put up a soft show of force slow walk aid to america's allies vacily because the democratic party is vacillating this is why wen jobidon tries to suggest for example that the blood of elexy novalney is on the hands of re publicans that is an amazing statement he is the current president of the united states if the president get's the credit or blame for what happens while he is president i notice that this old dute is the curent presient of the united states there he was over the weaken h ha whyaee o o sis that i would not use that turm athe're mking a big mistate not responding says jobin wi notice that you said that you were going to have harsh responds for navalney if he died that something a jobidon said when votey return to russia and then valney was immediately arested in goolog jobdon said there ould be significant reprecustions for russia should that happen shouldn'av oney be murdered well nown ife alney' bee murdered and jobidon are not doin bleep but again this ate broad scale problem for the united states and it is a conflict of vision with regard to form policye outsade the form policy tomate theunited states breaks down into least for camps first there are the neokons whave sort of an outsized roll in the american amagination because f the warner rock the neo consessentially made the argument the willsonian argumenthat t as america's job to preserve in foster democracy everywhere on earth regardless as to whether it was in americas tirect or indirect interests that effectively american values had to be spread no matter what and that the safest world was a world in which american valley's predominated even in places that were very unfriendly to american values that scool of thought has basically gone by the wayside and anybody who says t e word neo con right now with regard to the vast majority of politicians is is just talking nonsense evas majority of politicions even on the on the sor of hawish right were not in favor for example of the war in libya or direct american involvement in seria and many of them are not in favor of for example heavy involvement event in ucrane todays hope again the thes orf neo con idea was thoroughly defeated by donald trumpet twenty sixteen and was rather significantly descrided about the worne rock that that school of thought i would say has been largely martionalized then there is the sort of real politique school of thalgt which is their certain conflicts in which america does have an interest and tat does a mean boots on the ground means sometimes money it mean sometimes boots on the ground depending on just how strong those interests are an america does in facts have forein interests an america must apply its leverage in stracegic ways in order to achieve those interest that means getting involved in some conflict with money sa funding new crane to stop russia from taking over keeve but not necessarily throwing money down the radhole of attempting to have the tackle of a crimea which is not going to happen for example id count myself in the real politique camp of american foreign policy those are two groups then you have the isolationists isolationists sort of suggest that americ has no interest in what goes on around the world what is happening anywhere an americas interests are simply domestic nd that any dollar that is spent outside of america's borders is therefore a bad dollar i thing this is short sighted and wrong but you understand the tendency it is short sihted in the sense that america actually does have a very strong nterest in for example freedom of the sees america has an incredibly strong interest in how for example oil flows around the globe that does effect american citizens america does in fact have a very strong interest in american allies being prevented from falling or being destroyed or being significantly harm because those allies are the ones wo are going to come to our defends if god forbid the re an attack on the united states or their bunch of foreign interests that exists i think the isolationis position is untenable and when people suggest that it somehow immoral that foreignad in general is immoral i just onder what hey wuld a seit abou the marshall plan was the marshal plan imoral the marshal plan literally rebuilt all of western europe if it dad not happened then the soviets wout hav taken all of estern europe withthat ve ein fine also icin the enswers yes i think that is incredibly short sihted but that isolationist wing is is a thord wing and then thereis the fourth horseshoe theory wing of foreign policy and the horseshoetheory wing is occupied men increasingly large sigement of the left and shockingly in a small but increasingly large sigement o the right and that horseshooe theory wing is not isolationist in the sense that is just not an america's interest to be involved in forign policy it is the idea that america itself is deeply flawed and bad and that every act that happens abroughd is a resolt of the evils of the united states of of passtd american interventionism of americas foreign interests and that america should retreat from the world not because it is ian america's interest to do but becauseis in the world's interests for america to do an that theory involves the propping up of terrible dictators it involves the leaving in power of some o the world's worst people it involves leaving allies out to dry right that sort of stuff is the forth wing of american politics and the problem that we are seeng right now is a conflation of vrious wings o american politics on all sides of the of the various iles let us be clear when it comes to jo bidon's foreign policy jobidon's form policy vacilates between sort of what he thinks is the real policy and the horseshoe theory if vacilate strongly between those two poles becaue that is where the democratic party is split between the real polity there is some democrats who still understand thatamerica has foreign interest and those democrats for example support foreign aid to eucrane and israel by and large and then you have the democratic wing tht a sort of the ratical young people who believe that americo is bad and terrible in the world and basecly should revert to its own borders and then open those borders and that wing is very promin that is thor a shet eft to leab wing whof the democratic party tha is a very real wing and you seen the bide administration because jobidon cantactuay bridge that gap vacilating between the two positions wildly and that has led the rest of the world to conclude that america is in fact quite weak and the rest of the world is not necessarily wrong on that score meanwhile as far as the republicans who jobidon is blaming for all of this it' doneclear exactly at the republican party is doing at this point because the republican party has laid out various different views of its own on exactly what american for policy should look and you actually have wmembers are probably all four wings of the foreign policy establishment that i just described in the republican party yo ove members of two wings in the democratic party nyou members are pobably all for wings in ther poblican party if a small niche sor neo conwing a very large rael policyquing yve a a a small but growing isolationist wing andyou have not even smaller but still growing wing of horseshoe theory folks and the publican party is splip between all of those which leads to a vary confused and confusing take on what foregn policy ought to be doneclear exactly wats going to happen inthe huse representives all i would say is is it in america's interest for russia to take you cranehole not for russia to maintain that non basse or crimea and and the war i thnk everybody if they could make that deal happen hose of rational mine wants that deal to happen the question is whether ladiner pooten once that deal to happen i see no indicators at this point that he does he believes the west is going to collapse why dos he believe that only becaue of aftanistan a becaue of he atnom and because of roch an becuse every major foreign policy commitment at the west has made over the course of the last forty years certainly since the end of the cold war has largely ended with the west retreating to its own boarders and the various powers taking territory whether time about hong cong wrid tong madafcannistan ladmer putens simply playing for time meanwhile agan the re publicans fore a split on the sor of s of their not ture exactly wat to do represented my turner whos the had of the house intelligence comitte of ohio he says that that right now the husespeaker is trying to clear op house for u crane ad but having have time of it as president tilentky has been asking for the tade in toc tober for five monh now has speaker jon thinkinin you any issurant that he is going to bring you cran aid to the floor wutl pressent johnson has made a number of public statements committing ut to fine thing by palfway for the ed free crane i believe him i think that we will and this does meed to get don this is absoly critical for you as support afor you crane and to oppose russian aggrussion an we we will find out but one big problems of course that because all the parties are split along various lines not even clear what people want from you crane ccording to politico people in munic there is munic security conference and a bunch people showed up from various countries senter mark warner democrat a virginia n share of the sent intelligence committee said that the aid package being considerably quotin what a game change or for you crane but he did not make clear exactly what victory even look heu declined to say that thi support would insure you cranian triumph instead hy just said tha it was sort of the last hope it is unclear exactly what is going to happen in you crane an this part ofthe probem tor bin his ninin articulated what an and looks in you cranes wy you are seeing the rising isolationisan horse shou theory wing coas you do in fact have to tell your own citizens what the helior plans are when you spend significant amoun tof foreignade abroad even if you want o say as i would say that we are better off funding you crane to stave off a russian taking of keeve with the less than one per cent of money that we spent on our federal budget every year and fairly insignificant percentage even of our defence budget to basically restock our shelves grease the wheels in terms of getting our military production capacity up to up to snuff i even i jon't make that argument make the argument nobody's making any these argments truly annoying to be meanwhile china f course is seeing a bunch of weakness according to the wall street journal the chinese military had a giant military exercise about three months ago in the south chinase in the philippin se actually the philippin se which they swav of the pacific ocean east of tiwan was the sight ecite of a decisive air craft carrier battle an world ware two between the united states angepanic carriers are now once again gathering there and for good reason control of the phlipine se would be prized in any conflict between the china and the united states over tiwan or the south chinase yus worship's troops and supplies to ployed from baseon guamor wy would likely need to transit through that aria and chino wud wanto interrupt those flows your seeing the chinese attempting to take control of that particular location in october of twenty twenty three chinese air craft carrier and four o ther worships did at drill there in september they did another drill in this particular area in ganuary th united states held to drill there an vascilation at home leads to foreign agression ladimer lenen famously suggested that his form policy was probe with bayonets push where there is mush america's enemies know that theyr seing an awful lot of mush at this point i' get meanwhile on the american domestic front america's resholl problems continue to be seen in the halls of woke academia i's an amazing interview that was done with the free press by rolland friar rollan fire is a harvard professor we becam the youngest black pers an ever to be a worde tenyor and ivy league school at the age of thirty he says that he faced his threats and had he at arm security after he published a study in twenty sixteen shoing no racial bise in police involved shootings in fact his research found that officers were less likely to should black people than a white people in similar situations although the difference was not statistically significant as the epi times points out he said i let the day to talkind i do not care what at cost but then apparently he told berrywiss the editor of the free press in the founder of it he told her that he expected his research to show different conclusions ut when the research showed no bicon police involved shootings heou had a newteame of assistance and repeated the exact same study theresults were the same his harvard college told him nots publishd because they were worred that he would ruin his grer he did run it an in fact it did ruin his career former harvard president cloudine gay alege that fir's conduct with regard to one of his aids exhibited a pattern of behavior that failed to meet expectations and who suspended from harvard two years after being accused of engaging i quo unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature he denied all that obviously here is that roland fir discussing with verywise what at means to cross the establishment one of these universities one of the details in this story is that you ere suspended by woman who i had never heard of until recently her name is claddine gay and she said this in a letter to the economic department at the time professor friar exhibited a pattern of behavior that failed to meet the expectations of conduct within our community and was harmful to the well being of its members the totolity of these behaviors is a clear violation of institutional norms and a betrayal of trust of the harvard community i guess i when ask do you believe in carma a heres from and also does calling for the jeniside of jews constitute bulling and harassment yestor no a fauls an for s again the fact that that is hard to say at harvard university but get rid of romand fire was very easy to say at harvey university is demonstrof where oracial politics currently stands in alver the week an droyrid had herself ea a sane and solid dey she suggested that she deserves reparations did droyred am which is weird since her parents are emigrants to the country and are not in fact american tosense of of slaves here is droyrid talking about race in america to be a black person in twenty twenty four in america is to be in a state of complete perplexed confusion about what is wrong with a country that hates your history to this day cannot admit even the basics of what was done to your ancestors cannot accept any responsibility for the lack that has carried through the entirety of the existence of you in this countr y and think sixty years of relative freedom is enough and to find out that literally barocco bama's two terms in pre as president are your reparations and tuneteent which you already celebrated anyway is your reparations and yet you buil this country you literally physically built this country and yet the attitude toward you from a lot of your peers and your fellow citizens is just shut u and be grateful as let us be clear about doired she did not physically build this country in fact nobody of this generation as physically built thiss country to be realistic you are talking about whether in fact slaves worthe predominant drivers of the american economy in the antibellum eurup and other's from pretty hotly fought economic debate over this the typical answerer is no actually slavery is a drag on economic productivity pretty much everywhere that it is practice but put aside that entire argument droy read saying this taging bohow it is very dificult to be doired is pretty astonishing considering again her datis from congo on her mamas from guiana andta and she is a multimillionaire but this the state of our racial discourse in the united states ardyfolks coming up we are going to get into tusiens some new scientific

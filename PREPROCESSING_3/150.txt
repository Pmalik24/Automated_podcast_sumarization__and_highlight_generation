a quick warning there are curse words that are unbeeped in to days episode of the show if you prefer a beap version you can find that at our websiht this american life dout owork the question started re avet toben and his husband moved to the bayaria got a house together dobn founwers pretty excited about this they will wive within an hour and they brought meals over fo weeks his mon bought them shads but this question popped up and the first time i notice it happening it was with my aunt ki not o knower she was oh which one of you was handyes one of you handy and i was just why to she one to know that watshe care ye et i had i had feelings about it and i could not tell why am and then it just kind of kept happening with other family members they would be talking about all you gas moved in together into this house 's one which one of youse handy and on it is face it was kind of a oh we know when you 're in a house there is a lot of things to fix in a lot of things to do but it felt there was something else happening there and a kind of bothered me something else there there was a question underneath the question that they were trying to get the answer to yet lhike there was something else trying to be figured out and i do not know the more i thought about it and why i was having feelings about it it was kindly this weard a hamoment of oh i think you are asking who the man is in my relationship right you are both men yes for one of you is really the man yes yet then ut de would tell them tht his husband who was the handy one tell yo was is giving hem ammunition but pit your the relationship that just buggedhim ut they were being sized up an to famalior categories would you use the husband would you es the wife it was weird because when whenever they would ask it i could feel myself getting defensive i did not want to give them that picture and i think part of my defensiveness came from i think well o man not to take us in a whole other direction but if you spent any amount of time in the closet in th closet for debenamen's middlescool and high school i think you are afraid of being found out at all as being a feminette in any way y i know for me i was very konscious of if any one could detect quote un quote feminine traits about me and then figure out if i was gay or not and i do think that myself and a lot of gammen carry that around for a kind of a rest of your life and i think that comes up in having to answer a question this also ye ye is it it is funny cause it is this innocent question and then and them really look underneath it it is this a bomb witing to go off actually this many feelings yet it feels it hits on a thing at least for me that i spent a lot of time is a kid running from or spent a lot of time trying to not have to answer yeh how masculine am i end is somebody else more masculine than i am ooand i do won i make room for the idea that they could have meant none of this absolutely none of this did you address it directly with any of them no cause that would be bonkers to eoh you asked me whose handy you are trying to say i'm not a man that the leap in logic to say that outright is he uch would it inn a programme questions that contain other secret questions inside of them questions that our wolves in sheep's clothing in all gids of situations that we have all been in dating in talking the strangers in dealing with the saddest things that ever happened to us and more tebesychica goes this american live a mara glass say with us ba tayso instead of fordifferant acts today we be ging o tos going to present to show us four questions here isthe first one question tell me how you feel abat this sotoben who just heard is one of the editor heritor show and a really the idea for to day's programm came out of a conversation that happened to the staff meeting and what hapet is we all got talking about these kind of question traps where seems a somebody is asking about one thing but the question is a proxy for trying to figure out something else toben well exlain more the conversation was about the questions people ask on first states the kind that forced through some one really is out in the open maybe even without them realizing once such question i did not even knows a thing but a few of my coorkers said that for black women of a certain age it is having a kind of renascance emanual are executive editor asks it this way what do you think of beyond say it was a question that i found myself trying to ask becely a la on fir states because it told me a lot about them sthe question that tells you one in some wis how they feel about a power who black woman it is the question that tells you how they think a bowed black woman in gen hakind of a little bi to me and thot if you feel the neat to her down or see something negative about her it it is a real turn off it is a red flag basically i they describe a singing style of kind of castlewooling a us she just scracing been another producer has also asked this question on many a day all thes weds that sotof halw double meanings of your woman and als of you black woman i'm just aris that you do not loud people yo can think ias you do not me could you tell me about some specific times that you have asked the beyond say question and what the guyes response fas in what it told you first a barda pretty standard beyon they actually came on in the bar in the background s a go whal you think about beyond say and he was i do not i do not understand what the big deal is about her you women act there in a calter something and at they seem crazy i was oll i really her n i do not nowly think i'm in a cold emanual watchd the guy through al the reasons beyond say is in fact pretty gray but the guy did not budge no he he did not did not care to and mebe did not care to hear me talkin generals what i seems sothey didn not go out again because well you could say he was unapologetic when he fucked out the night that is a playon up beyond say leric by the way sorry could not elp myself anyway b parker whose also been on the show yo sait for her it does not even have to be beyond say andyou well known black woman dos the track yo say sita williams ilo say a is overable y it youll say seda polcetilsusti lassalasons a ronin woses life ittota y i a lit aa liza assls coveras i'll bring up a blacksy al celebrity sin it there a polala i it usually becaus a littles tess for how they would sinl as a part a how they with veme as a person but the beyonsa question she agrees is the most potent because the answer can really tell you if you should be crazy in love or putting everything he owns in a box to the west again i am sorry the thing about abunch of people using the same trick though is that eventually peopl in this case men my cachon are you aware of the beyond say question yet iam era be beal tha question emanuel duchy producer and man at the show have you experience this yet i e e many he told me about a date os on where they started talking about musicals a movy virge on a dream girls came out and thinking he was just answering the question about the movy manuel was honest said beanse was just docey in that an hen' realized he was answering the wrong question i n bedy up all oy you wuld deli e oeon bebe o tat beon tay e ai yet he e ma e ede main no e do ye ot it was only later that he learned from another gy friend why he is a black man should really only answer one way i mene ma ma ban ba be ta o be wa you that women won you he de han i yo ready li tak wet we man e by i oeoe e ma eople were ing o an e wo tat that quit you wa in some cases that beyonsa question is an agreed upon first or both parties know their talking ind cod parker was recently on the date she mentioned beon says blackas king fell an he i c e he he was i doft oat to say he cas i i i this i talking to you but i do love beats a and i dotways you to be ma lie he knew it was a trap e did ot was it trap and aded you respon is bat he talking about what ye at heas i i no gi o this was yer your ri i i onsa a i it i ios ta cilos the right anser swe a home a dates of course there are other questions the beyon say one little traps we sat on dates hoping the other person does not fall in or hoping they do one that made the news recently which mayor may not be true according to an old classmate governor ronto santis would ask states if they liked ty food but and this is key he pronounce it fy food and if they said no it is tig food not fi he ditch the date it was his way of testing if they correct him which he did not ont ano somce a test i'd be grateful o fal but that just me anyway i talke to a bunch of other people about their question traps calsy in minnesoda asked her dates about their favorite tom hanks movies she said he is been in many movies acrossmultipl jonras the answer is kind of a personality test toy story for example tells her thereis a stunted adolescence thing going on sarah an tampa said when she started to get a weird vibe she would ask what is your favourite conspiracy thery most people would keep their answers light hearted but occasionally some one would go all in on i started talking all about not see separatis she is jewish sayi now kind of a deal breaker but not all question traps her subtle there is another jonra that i was surprised any one fell for the kind of question that seemed covered in yellow caution tape the sign that said this is a trap this one comes from vivian aniowa after her husband died in twenty sixteen she found herself back out on the dating scene her question on ta date was if your ex wack by right now with her new partner what would you do which was her way of asking much more interesting question how focked up was your last relationship for if then i didit that gui aid i would toce him and gave her a peece of my mind oh my got exactly we had just got down to havea nie lunch on a funday afternoon fo on lik do i get up and go or a and that lend a thory came out of how you fo about a couple week away from going to port for finda lifein hid the wor and it had been a thirty eight year relationshiv an he found out she had been cheeting trummle of the time in a comletly terein detiv way she gave him an old pone and that she had wife an when she fond o ded the cloud it downt noted into i fone to and not al he found out wel you got much information an that one question you get a make it a fichen to why draw it out i was shocked this question is clearly how bad was your last break up do i have anything to worry aboup but something about turning it into a finmal lice baker an these guies open up there with another guid that fid well we would have to leave immediatele cul getto want to feev ut an my repgy was you do not want to he dom or you do not want gen he out and what was his response i no he never anser directly bu i knew tan tat he gillin a wi liniship with her now husband they met at a widows support group he talked about his lonliness and being single parent the kand a isgot each other she knew the question what would you do for an acthowed up would not be right for this nice guy who had just lost his life she was at at ast that the last person i talk to was justicup sheu tu to see assal classes in at lanta wun sher ghoes you question a do you believe in go ghosts bet you did not see that one coming did you do you believe in ghosts her saw justicasas of works there is no one rigt answer it just matters that you in yau prict er hap the faint answer efentually an at te core your mind kind of work in a fo oer way was there ever time that you asked the ghost question the person answer differently than you and you when i hadin dated that person anyway and how dod that go ye a ye i was engage befor i married my hamen now and agot question really hould have been my get the fock out i really ye her answer tof the question as i do not really believe in ghost but if there was evidence to the contrary i could be convinced i m open to changing my mind n his refon fo no and there is no information that you could get me to taink my mind an i de oon't fe my anyon wen very think that at the time she did not think much about the difference in their answers but then she got to know in better other things would come up and i wuld frostrated about the factorry everything with you wit no black an wite not a ehuter clack and life from time ter gray a and then i kind ov go back your can te re question his rigidity was one of the big things that broke them up now she tells every onetion os here seeing some one knew asked them the ghost question i could save you a lot of time the thing about any trap of course is there are ways to side step at disarm e and then a person who laid the trap has to decide what to do emanuel had to make such a decision ironically enough my current waverand had no idea who beyonsay was who is the only person who had that response what did that tell you that he just needed of education he is older and he is not from this country and doezn' was not a music really and mike iby the second d he had read the entire wirkapety of hage for me and he knew beyonthis birthday and that she was married to daisy and he knew about the elevator fi as that he lwas tent to your opinion yet itended of being a green flag now i talk to him about be onsing all the time and i do not necessarily think he is he is not going out to teonce a concenter anything that he understands how important he is and how prnch is to me and lets me rant about her i's alghl you ever really want ra it is all i think anyone wonts some one you do not feel you have to set a trap for some one who you can look at them and say you are everything i need and more it is written all over your face baby i can feel your halow pray it will not fad away si in as time now tepenlel is an edator on ar program question to how old are you kids this a particular piece of small talk that happens all the time thetver some people is the most normal thing in the world and for others is a super delicate minefield this a story that ou bet hears abut a couple for whom it is minefield and how one day a question this comes up and it goes completely differently from how it is ever gone before for them and he spictacularly wild way you will hear what i'm talking about quistbenderov tells the story stacy's soberman is the real estate agen southern california and she is well suited to the job because she is excellent at making conversation with strangers about anything but for the past six and a half years there is been this classic jonra of get to know u banter that is become a lot more complicated for her in her husband michael and that is questions about their children a yes all the time talkin y people getting introductions it is always asking about our kits how many kids to you hav loale how old ar thay the answeris to these questions are complicated for stacy because her older child max died in twenty seventeen it has been sixen ap yours because i have a doc tet to for every six months this is stacy's hasban michael max's dad he is is s p e straight laced kind oguy for the most part i max always wanted us to get tet es we never did and i feel read he had some ehe has hat wonderful sleeve and lots o tetus but i i am covered in tatts and my right arm is re tired memorial for maxy i've got ta the kids tt to up heur on my right shoulder sir did you have tetes before hea nor but it is tet os of her interesting thing its it is it is it is less than the least i can do but it does help me through the pain in te toing really how i see it from my prespective is just a socially acceptable cutting max was a funny kid always loved playing pranks who by fifteen was struggling with druggadiction going in and out of treatment he overdoes me was twenty five in his parents house and after he died for a while michael and stacy where ran friends an family who knew what had happened nobody asked thos do you have kids sort of questions then stacy travelle to a conference in albakirkey she was sitting down for lunch next to a couple friendly blindwoman in her husband he began asking stacy where she was from which she did and then finally those questions do you have kids how old ar thay and e woman was you dont kint o sather very sweet very bubbly in when people are that with me it all pretty open and ie felt being authentic and i told her won o my children died of an overdos two years ago and now i have one this did not go overwell this woman and er husband it it really upset them they could not they just could not handle the conversation di just saw thes major pitty face with the open mouth and the oh a and there is the conversation with them kind of stall out at that point and than they kind of totally stal out they never talk to me again of course overtime this happened again and again strangers would aske them these sorts of questions and when they would answer it suckle the air out of the room she made michael especially un comfortable he never sharing this staff with strangers he is more of a private person but together he and stacy came up with the strategy for had a handle things were we are out an about and the question comes up we were sure to look each other just a little u and persheptibly shollshon oa we really pick up what is going on ah and then usually statie will answer however she an tor an ther supporter unreservedly a lot of the times actually lie with two kid sir this is their ages totulater and keep it short in sweet because sometimes the white lie is matter for that person cause they are aut a party ithere out having fun and they defftly do not want to here about your dead child and on they went answering some questions about their kids and bobbing and weaving rand others for six and a half years till this one day last november and the got themselves into a situation that was very different for many that they would been in before and very public one thing to kno about stacy an my chael as they both spend a lot of their time working at a re covery center for people struggling with a diction ansometimes they hang out with the other staff and clients there and i saw that they were going to a show at the hollwadam prob where sara silvermen was performing and i mi go ly got a love sara silvermen i want to go i want to go and i said when we got they are go i want to set front ros senter i want to get heckled i want i i want o be right under sara silvermen i wanter to heckle me if possible or me hi o gas we hackled them i do not know i just wanted to be a part of it they get seases front rest sinter but before sara silverman came on stage that night at the hollywood im prav there was this opener kind him adam ray early forties wearing a mariner's cap he is got this backing ban drums keyboard back up singers ane ends in said with tha song about how all his friends with kids are miserable an boring t on the song shifts adam raye says sings that he and his wife are still desiding about having kids suddenly he turns to the crowd once to find some one with kids who can make an argument for having them adam starts in the front rol the guy a few seets awaye from staysingl s mid the word kids came up i went on hihler and i just had a feeling oll mi gotwere shood in the front row is he can come to us we r i unders cause i knon't know what himin to say on o redea with it and remember when comicloe you nos station i ta conci te communicat with one another a we cannot do that here in is genu look at each other and gettan idea know what you think what you thinkn without talking on there sorve in a desert waiting and then i saw him come into me of course he comes to me you a yeny kids e wy o fet the assertive for the guy he does not my talking about this i was hink of mewhat you fucking non it cisin that the protedly should shut the pucp up and get out right your probably was a little attitude perhaps you think and ah i trink et that would bet but the comedans not done with him oo o oo o o and he still not done o o o o a oo o oao o o ao a a a o o he finally comes down to me with the mikhre wan howld your kids and that is where i was having difficulty calculating tere's nobody asked s me how old the artipically the first thing it went through a mind was well ser bring is twenty sixon by that time i was focked because there was no time to forget som exetraty what that did not happen whil michaels thinking at am the comedian keeps holding the mycrophone waiting this dad is taking too long to answer and finally oi o othe o wit yo a o nother o o his myself protective over hem in that moment that is a loded question and ot's why cant answer you o then the comic turns to stacy i o other is o o do i you a is ta theo a oo o o is oo and then i thought to myself o now i've got a tell the truth and and it as split sikad very impulsive moment i sad i'm sorry tie is but one of our kid is actually ded o o oooo o a a o on stage no one quite knows what to dea when of the back up singers but sor hands of our face the keyboard play i just shakes his head no and then i realize i just sered the shell oso s this moment for the camedian seems prettyan surmountable reay what could he possibly do to say to set after that i called him up adam ray he said he considered changing the subject but chos not to and finally it is act she stacy who save the day she motions for adam the comedian he bends down in points miht at her and then she says i sad our dad son would think this was hilarious osn't a li at all ours dad son would have thought this was wholarius he would have been all my guide of course my mon stepped in a big pile of shet then adam gets an idea weas oile the vidio of adam sat at she made the rounds on tik tok and instagram afterward stacy says she read every last comments all these people rejoicing for and remembering her son i have listened to that thing a hundred talkings i think as i keep ben joying it it was what yors was acredible just was incredible momen atarm bots of people have asked them questions puting them in this complicated spobut this time infront of all those people that ended with a roomful of strangers cheering for macs this time is their favoritecrispender af s one of the produces on a show coming up the question about a four hundred year old play add the personal question underneath that question it is a menute cicagopobogridio when a program continues this mericon lie fro myrglass tay's programm the question trap we were tuk him that today is those questions that can seem benevolent innocent harmless and noccuus could not heart a fly but underneath the really asking something else we quietly making a point about something else weve arrived to question three of our programm question threeh has your mam sh we spout of this next thing we went to play you in an academic journal as originally a paper in medical anthropology quarterly read by anethropologists named genow tailor who adapted it to read here on the radio this one question the general tell is writing about it kept showing up all the time in ar personal life she s as is ananthropologist she knows whene lots of people or asking the same question over and over hit mean something she rode the sas say to think through what is underneath that estion my mother is living with progressive dimensia because i'm reading these words on the radio i cannot hear your response but i'm listening for the question that as i've learned always comes every one almost without exception responds with some version of the same question does she recognize you there are variance of course does she still know who you are but does she still know your name however it may be phraise the question is always whether my mother recognizes me meaning can she recite the facts of who i am what my name is than how i'm related to her when every one keeps asking me does she recognize you i find myself thinking that is the wrong question i believe the question really is or should be do you do we recognize her as a person who still here does she recognize you the weirdness of the question becomes more obvious if you think about what would be required to answer it lets say i ask my mother what is my name who am i how old am i how do we know each other testing her that way what is it prove what is it actually accomplish i read a book by a journalists name loren cestler she wrote about how she would correct her own mother when her mother caled her by the wrong name every time she would visit her mother she would take framed photoes from the dress ar in point to them and quis her mother who this is do not you mam of course she did not kestle writes i told her again and again each visit who is who and then quized again thinking back on this now i am appalled at my insensitivity what did i think i was doing i manage to accomplish only two things i made myself miserable and i made my mother irritable i do not need my mother to tell me my name or how i'm related to her iready know these things and i know that she has domensia why then when i make a point of asking her these questions that i know she cannot possibly answer it seems rude or just mean i cannot bring myself to do it i guess she could say that my mother raise me better than that wodoes she re cognize you i'm not convince that the inability to remember names necessarily means that a person with dimensia cannot recognize or care about other people but very often it does mean that other people stop recognizing and caring about them my mother was close to lots of people but only one friend remains present in her life every month or two eli davis drives an hour and a half from her home to siattle to visit mam bringing treats and hugs and are always cheerful self i love her dearly for it and i wonder where are the others whereare the couples with whom i parents socialized the women with whom mam spent hours and hours on the phone all through my childhood thies should not surprise me as much as it has maybe it is not fair to expect friends to step up even close family drop off friendships in america are not usually expected to survive demensia friendships are often more pleasure grafts than life rafts not built to brave the really rough waters then does she recognize you when people ask me whether my mother still recognize me they are often expressing concern for me asking me how i'm bearing up under the burden of suffering that her dimension must place on me and ay're quite ready to hear about my burdens in my suffering what they find harder to hear i think is it being around my mother is not a nightmare or a horror is not any of that here is what it is in a cafe as we share ascone mamm and i make what passes for conversation i've learned to ask only the sort of question that does not require any specific infor mation to answer things going o kay with you these days how is my favourite mam doing you are doing all right i tell her funny little stories about my kids sometimes we leave through a magazine looking at the pictures and commenting on them sometimes we look out the wind dow and i make general observations that require no specific response looks spring is coming look at those leaves coming out on the trees backi's hare is really curly with each exchange mamm smiles on me beaming affectionately and that familiar slightly conspiratorial way as if we are both in on the same joke our conversations go nowhere but it does not matter what we say really or whether we set it before or whether it is accurate or interesting or even comprehensible the exchange is the point mamm and i are playing catch with touches smiles and gestures as well as words mambing them back and forth to each other in slow easy underhand arks the fact that she drops the ball more and more often does not stop the game for being enjoyable it is a way of being together does she recognize you she may not recognize me in a narrowly cognitive sense but mamaum does recognize me as some one who is there with her someone familiar perhaps and she does not need to have all the details sorted out in order to care for me the impulse to care the habit of caring these are things that run deep in my mother some one who for most of her life was very engaged in caring for other people her children or a husband her grandchildren and her friends even some of the behavourold works of my mamma's develop make sense to me in those terms as expressions of care here is an example people with do men shall often engage in repetitive behaviours and mamma is no exception when i take her out to a cafe i usually get a cup of black coffee for myself and order a cup a hot chocolate for her not too hot and do not forget the whip cream on top as we drink them she checks constantly to see whether my cup and hers are even whether the liquids have been drunk down to the same level and if not she will hurry up and drink more to catch up or else stop and wait for me or if we share a cookiy she is concern to make sure that the haves be the same sizes and that we eat them at the same rate i think keeping track of whether our drinks and cookies are even comes naturally to my mother a woman who is always had to carefully divide quite limited resources first with her own brothers and later among her four children she is cared about such details all her life and caring about them was also a way in which she cared for other people mamm also does still take care of me in some small but important ways one time a little more than a year ago i stopped by the assisted living facility where she was living at the end of a very busy day and in especially hectic week i had stayed up very late the night before trying to finish grating student papers then spent the whole day teaching and in meetings i went with her up to her room i turned on the t v and we sat down together on the couch i was exhausted i leaned back and yawned mam patted my hand and said to me you are tired just go ahead and sleep you can just lay down right here and i sat there next to my maum holding her hand feeling her warmth against me all long one side of my body and i leaned my head on her shoulder and slept does she recognize you for a while after we first move my mother into an assisted living facility she often said that she wanted to go home i understood this to mean that she wanted to move back to the house where she had lived for forty years until my father's death the house in which i grew up usually i responded with my own mild version of reality or iantation explaining as gently as possible that that house was all empty and cold now and nobody was there to keep her company or help er du stuff t was probably better to stay here one time though i asked her a question in stead you mean home to the house up in edmon's no on the farm she answered you go down with her raised arm she traced out the curve of a long ago road for the first few years of her life my mother had lived on a small farm in southern itaho before her father moved the family to seeattle during worbar too to seek work on the docks there inside there she added who i asked my mam an my dad my mother's in her seventies her parents are not waiting for her inside an ido farm house you could use that evidence to draw clear line between us me here on the side of reality confidence personhood recognition her over there on the side of delusion incapacit not quite fully human but what she was longing for was her childhood home she missed her mamm and dad she was trying in her own way to hold on to them just as i was trying against the odds to hold on to her our predicament is exactly the same cannot tell her she is professor of the university of tronto ti you medical entropology erman sherly an teller died in ti an tan you knows clecting ti i say anothers about to mention into a book you can fine oling to the original ecademicortical that shou wrote had or metsad thak for can i help you oo he heare's one last example of a

obothy sas followed by three unique body per gra i can tel she is overwhelmed i say remember grads do not matter div ya learning cannot be measured just trust how you feel you did she says mabe grads do not matter if your rich but in my family grat ar wham prn i think i thought that firt that if yet id and have the words to talk about the play in any new onced way but now i start to think that her understanding is deeper than my oowwn end she mig never tot te me abouto tellow honestle and should and hag to fi nolly i as i shechet want me to fe bie her with some evy answer the satis li her teacher and get her her tot a nes ter unscathed i'm oke your teacher is either looking for an essay that slike yes a tfellow is very rasist the story of the play is there is the super professionally and romantically successful blackman all of these white geyes are jealous of an cannot handle that tension is resolved when the white guey's trick atellow and murdering his wife thereby turning him into the brutish stereotype they wanted him to be alalong that the title roll was performed in blackface for centuries under scorslis moreover that is the good that kind of a transition word dive ya moreover i man my next body paragraph will be about moreover destimona's whiteness in contrast is repeatedly presented as a nately good innocent and desirable that is one i say you could write that would get an a the other assay you could write that would also get an a goes no a thellow is not super rasist a tellow is a flaud attempt at antirasism in that it shakespeare's only play to centere a dynamic black protagonis the play was band in a parti south africa for depicting an interracial relationship moreover the place most prejudiue characters are always presented as either stupid rodrigo or evil yago it would be mistake to conplaye the prere pectives of these characters with the meanings of the work as he whole either the the sas would get as divya but what your teacher's reducted yes in a promp does not alow for is an essay that what i think i think which is something a tellow is he product an reflection of another culture elizabeth in england four hundred years old rich n at a time when race with just being invented as a system of ower the play later became a cultural export of the british empir which colonized blacken prown people around the world the play remains the best fellar of the shakespeare in dustrial pcomplex another words o give you a fello and racism are indelibly linked that the question is afello racis seems to confuse both what racism is and what artworks are in my opinion with really raceas divia is that we are required to read othello for the billian time that it is on the corriculen at your brook lan public high school even though the plate is boring awhen we could rea reading any number of contemporary black plarates to you respons do not hate me but i kind a trdin ry is really crazy and the languan yeis really pritty mar crae de woer

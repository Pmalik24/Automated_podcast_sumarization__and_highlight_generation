jon's life and herlen twentias was about as far from roral texas as you can get in this country she lived in cambridge massachusetts was married to a p h t stude in english literature at harbard name pascal cul beche junior pascal's father was the editor and lifelong friend of john steinback which meant that sometimes john got to go to intimate parties in yor city full of literary heavywaits swas often there sobella and arthur is arthur miller arthur miller i when arthur married marilan of course thand everybody wanted to go to the dinner pardy marylynd of course was marylan in row she was quiet did not talk of hola but she was going to sona we all just sat there and look at her and were happy that she was there the men did most o the talking and i was also a quiet at those parties to i did not feel as comfortable i they they were often talking about things sat were not familiar to me about thet work politics i had a the baby by then and that was taking utmost of my attention jone's marriage to pascal was pretty standard for the time he was a bread munner she was the home maker jon raised two kids eventually became as school teacher and then many years later when johle wan sixty six paschal died of cancer after his death she got mornval te bon ter work she been doing at the local asal you chapter shance to prison mail and start corresponding with several immages to find out about conditions in the texas prison system which is how she first met michel he was fifty two nearly thirty years into his prison sentence and he sent a letter that found its way to jon sise dear friends i am a prisoner on the east hamd munit of the tex's prison system i came to prison with the death penalty in nineteen seventy i state on there was nothing special about michael's letter she was asking about getting imvalved withan ti death penly work his own death sentence had been communed to life in nineteen semry three and he become something of an actibist in prison heavily involved in prison reformasus john read his letter and dutifully wrote back then michael wrote back then john wrote and on michael an jon wrote to each other almost every single day for ten years michael was self taught but his letter showed how much shead read including must of john steinbck and his intellect in pressjon she was constantly communicating with prisoners five to ten at a time but michael's letters stood out he was a good writer take this letter he wrote to john after he intentially injured himself cut his own a killy's tendant to protest worked to to conditions i had grown to lod my body without norsisism almost as a fre in a faithful companion it was after all my only refuge from the ful in the stand in the scorn as i sit there contemplating the harsh tast at hand i fon't it trater as though i were committing the highest treeson it was losin you bobohe looked to me he was he looked james cagni it just was perfect james gagnin except that he did not have very good teeth a he had just a few teeth on the bottom i saw him an he was james cagny an mice to love james cagney in his movies but again it was not a it it was not love at first sight or anything that cause i'm not that sort of person i go for the mind first and and he had a wonderful bite and we just had lots to talk about het was not all intellectual and his letters michael started using ped names for joane he called her sweet baby joan and other things too dear noble little squall sreet baby dearest finger looking good sweet baby dear honey but and her letters joewer send up his wel i think i'll fix the a big scotch and go sit in the back yard and smoke a cigarette and try to get me into prospentin at i wish you were here to spank in his i every sunday after joleman drived ha few hours to visit michael in prison a book on tape playing on the car steria she saved the same fancy bet an breakfast near the prison became friends of the people who ran the place and then the rest of the week she got to go back to her own life and did what she wanted to do e was romance but on her terms something she would never experience michael and jone man hog and kiss discreetly on their contact visits this was all in a public visiting room there was nothing conjugal byut what was going on the limits of their time together were clear and jone was happy with the arrangement i kind of to being alone it is very comfortable for a woman too no that' somebody loved hsir and yet she has all thays freedom to live her own life michael and jone knew that no matter how close they became they would never really be together rarely if ever does a former death row in may et prawled in texas really what they had was her letters here is another one from jon a song that his always torn my heart is the september son you remember in these few precious days i'll spend with you a thefe feaand especially in our case the days are few and we may never spend them really together we must get use to this reality and not reay my hers we may i love you precious mike espeeday sweet baby joane soa may to someonand two thus and five they got married but that was mainly that they would not luse a visitation rights the prisoner had denied them visits before and they lived this way happily for five years then in june twenty ten michael was summoned by prison authorities he walked into a room and an official came to speak to him he said a are you jeel lasty yet he sould here i got at present for you and he handed me a sheet of paper and i started reading it and i hid may e prol michael was confused just o month or before he gone before the pawl board and been denied just as he had been many times before my banco stoppe breathing for about two or three minutes i i did not really i was cin at my first reaction was jhus has got to be a fuc can mistake yit was onheard of it somethael that happens once every ten years in prison to somebody michael has no real idea why he was prold he thinks o might have had something to do with a loss wut he fild against the prison system saying that it was under staffed and unsafe releasing michael made the las suit go away i think it was a surprise to both of us when he suddenly was put on the street he was scared it the thought ot coming ou he was not prepared for it neither one of us wats really i wanted him home and i knew it was going to be hard i knew it was going to be difficult and i knew that the chances of the relationship lasting wer very bad but i i had agreed to try it an do you think that you would have got into the relationship as you did into the degree that hou did if you knew that he was actually gan ta get out one day i cannot answer that really do not know now with michael about to be released the contractd we talked about the beginning of this story the one that laid out all the shared household in relationship duties should michael a convicted murderer ever get prold that contract was about to be put into effact the contract stipulated a two year trial period for ther marriage if it turnin to a real marriage fine if it did not they would be other separate ways jone could fire michael or he could quit those were their words at any time nobody keeps the tistics on how long prison marriages lost on the outside but losts of prison people woild tell you most end before in years o on augus twenty first twenty ten after forty years in prison and ten years would jon michael was a free man jone was waiting for him in a part cart the prison gates wearing an ear ring michael had made for jone was nervous and excited that she had not slept the night before she had a whole romantic vision for the day she made a reservation at a five star hotel michael walked out wearing his prison as shued jump soo nervous and overwhelmed to be out and he did not kiss me or anything he just got into the caran said let us go it was a very unromantic meating and that was cannot hurt me i was he lated but i was kind of beweeldered i do not think you can describe it i thought he would be as warm to see me as he was in the visiting rooms were hug me and yu know try to steal and extra kiss or something on no he was very business it was not wet they show in the move he sit o as comprehandsim as the contract was it did not cover everything i did not occurrd to them include anying about sacts a quick warning anyone listening with kids this next bit of the stories about that michael had never had sex with some oney loft and forty years in prison left him pretty mest up on that subject i did not expect him to be afraid to cuddle i you knot we have our clothes on and he he hugs me all day long but but geti naked with somebody it makes him very uncomfortable especially the last few years i she had taken in more in more of a mother figur to me and when i actually when we got in hotail room together than i started pace in the floor i did not a fand with eti this rex if what i mean i think what he means is their relationship ad shifted over the years and she was now seventy nine remember sixteen years older than michael whence they were in a hotel room they realied tot the nature of their feelings toward each other were really compicated over the years they would known each other jone had gone from initially feeling she wanted to adopt michael to one his sleep with him to now that he was out a kind of mish mash of all this feelings he is still in adopten child and he still my best companion an i love him anis my best friend it is altogether in im i'm comfortable it then o no michael mived into jones suberban ranch house and dawlis and got to know her family in france their lots of academics all sorts of people one sattings he never encounter before she was surprised how well he did socially but they had their rocky moments john took michael to a wine tast hing party and he got fall down drunk jone had to holl him outside to avoid making a scene this happened two or three times he never really drank socially before usually just to get hammerd and at parties with jon he would go too far pardly to calm his nerves one of jon's friends someone whad been close to jone's first husband pascall was appalled by her choice of a second husband and ended their friendship s na been four years since michael got out they made it way past the trial pery in their contract michael still leaves the stove on and the front door open thinks he never had to think about when he was in prison he leaves this stuff lying around everywhere jone says it is having a too nature in the house again but they have learned to deal with all this their lives are inther twined on somehow it is an equality of people in this marriage dead he did not have before i was still dependent upon my husband and his reputation but with mi thoits disits i figur iv become free in some strange way the neighbors have to accept us the way we are now an know they got a criminal in their neighbour love to have out there with all his ded salow and you non now that jone is in her early adies she started to wonder what is going to happen to michael whene she is gone that was not in the contract jon figures maybe they have got another seven years together we will have to find you another old lady to take you prospects are gone o be few and far between i findit other cin to guarden teacher wo well

depth they joke about it their serious about it they navigate it and it is some point in the trip john and tig pull over at a roadside store that sells fireworks and tombstones may be two different people on a different road trip would not have stopped or would not have stayed if they stopped but as friends who are also comixs they both head into the field of tombstone and start improvising

classic place to realize all right i'm lost the sometimes you realize that you lost you personally lost and then you get into the car and you drive as far as you can to solve that problem jame spring is this story i's bartly about that there is this gy that i've known for ever his names keven he is about forty a father now with two kids back in the summer of nineteen eighty nine when keven had just turned sixteen his dad let him drive from sandiego to central america with his older brother kevon was super excited it was the adventure of a lifetime he would saved up nearly a thousand dollars working after school at a yoger chuk kevon's brother who was twenty one at the time you parts of mexico pretty well after he would dropped out a college it seemed that he was down in ba all the time he was a hard charger liv with a bunch of tach who guies yho look fellons hou drove this kick asked red jeem with no doors little wild but hou'd always looked out for keve since they were little kids kevon was not worried could gu travel with watch out for me well woren'cspanish drink beer and smoke cigarettes but there were other interesting facts about keven's brother too some of which would soon becomet concerns that thing that the brother was doing in baha not legal the tat too guys who looked fellons were in fact fellons nd actually kevan's brother himself had recently been released from a short stint ind county jail the older brother had anger issues he was a control freek the trip mean it soft it ended badly and it ended early there was a blow out fight two drove down one flew back i was happy to get our plainingto home i han enough of the driving it had enough for my household brother and now i'd become a fight and even though we had fought before really this was the worst one there is one more important thing to know about keven and his brother when they were kids they would been everything to each other supercloshes warbudies because they grew up with a step father who was a real bastard violent and they moved around a lot every year a new school no friends really just each other this trip that fight it decimated their relationship the two never really spoke about the trip again did not speak much at all it is been more than twenty years i wanted to talk to keven about this and how we feels about it now sin't iredy know how his brother feels about this cause i'm his brother o ga we are we are recording you goodn't r im getn sot me ithink talk about the long trip when i first suggested that we talk keven was ambibolent i think hou wondered ly what good could come of it which is fair cause i have not been an easy guy to talk to but i had some things i wanted to say and look in this story i'm not going to come off well i was a real prick and the late aidies i was the ferst person in my family to get into college i dropped out after six months some friends let me crash with them one night i threw a party that went off the rails and three shots rang out from a sem i automatic handgun the idiot that fired the gun thit was me my gon he victed hend i started hanging with some truly bad people we were running t e fedran and coat from bah into sandiago one night there was a drug ratat our house everything got flushed down the toilets before the cops got throg the door but i still got a rest of thro all of is though a still somehow had this great girl friend ere wa sweepd wonderful thand i slept with some other dril it that got me gonarea is what it got me and no girl friend i ruined much much but i could run away from almost all of it and take penacyllan for the rest i was twenty one years old a colossal mess and i'd just wanted to get my jeap and drive to mexico and beyond see the temples of the aztects the myon ruins i prepared to drive all the way to central america for the summer and i would take with me the one person who i was sure did not think i was such a bad guy i was dunbeing that bad guy anyway shallow selfish me that people hated i was ready to throw myself into something reel on this trip something important something smart before we left i removed the back seat from the jeap and replaced it with a welded lock box with maybe two suit cases worth a storage space then i loaded it with tha lot of books i'd always been a reader a studier and i planned for the summer was sure hang out with my brother but also to learn the language of the lock and don mions nd i was going to learnd to read the mezzal american hirogliffs i even made flash cards for myself this trip would be an opportunity for me to figure out once and for all why the myon alization disappeared heo argeologis had been on the job for more than a century and still nobody knew why all these cities were abandonedbut i was pretty sure that this summer i was ging to get it nailed down all ansers lay somewhere in those lost cities deep in the jungle an lucky kavin he was about to see every one of them planke teaching eats aa too to acon rushma mitla temple naso i can nan these things but i cannot remember them they all jsplen to gather for me ans rocks crumbling and the idea of seen the ruins was't that was your idea uwhy you were't going to mexico sixteen just turn sixteen i knew there was going to be beer i knew there was gein be telees at the tourisponse and a hopefully serf good warm wanter i've no recollection of serf being on the iter i i mean i do not know off we went with our high hopes such wildly different high hopes into mexico to get us to the important places where i wanted to be most days i' need to drive us for stretches of six or eight hours lotof times cavenjus wanted to stop in a village and seastuff but there could be no stopping when we did pull into little towns people were curious about the two gringoes who showed up in their pueblo they would asked questions and i'd tell them to mind their own business i was not some freek show odity what i was was a pretentious deuchbag who could not be bothered to interact with the common man kevan thaugh was energized by being around other people and the more the marrier he loved it when we were in the beech towns full of american tourists and in the small villages he would fumbled through the few spanish words that he knew and start these inane conversations with everybody it grated on me i was not much better on the road driving on mountain highways was freeing unnerving especially at night and lot of the time the map just to not seeme to reflect the reality on the ground my spanish was not great but the little phrases that i used to navigate around paha worn't working for me here the dialects were different i could not understand a lot of the responses and i did not handle it well which i could not hide from cavin e was sitting right next to me as we pull away from the topo you often i feel i remember that you io caneet or gii's as suitable question you knowin just the a caunt of this continually watching yew the navigator asked i wudo not donwas ta kee dog the and and i just be lik godhe just asked that question two turns to go i knew we did not understand what the guy said much in my head i would just p coonat a fokin inif i can understand what he said we drove south through masablan down to port of iarto it was all green and junglly and full of tourists having fun i knew that i was better than them i was not here for the parasailing and the tikeila poppers i had a mission this is from my journal entry about the ruins at eashlan tillrio july twenty second three o on p m this temple is the highest of the fifteen pluff structures found here the floor of the temple structure is four feet off the ground an his reach by six narrows deep steps there is a perimiter wall that runs the circumference save for four entrance ways not equadistan the wall reaches to ten feet above the ground and has in its design ommetrical hrosses as borewas allan round on of th ana the e journal one hundred and ninety pages long and late in every night i wrote down all of the important mezo american anthropology stuff from the trip which includes virtually note people at least no living people if you were forced to read this entire journal and then tried to de duce the importance of the keven character in my life you might guess that he was maybe boy and tacostand or boy at beach number for he just did not figure into my narrative and wone other thing about this journal and not sure how to say this except to just say it along the way i met some girls and if things went well with those girls then they would earn a little note at the top of the journal page for the day right about the ground breakan archaeological pata and the note would say for example remember blanka and i totally do remember blanka there is that for me it was all ruins all the time we drove to the ancient toltec city of tula and visited aztec temples at tan auka and suntesesalia and the ruins of tale toa kon and bi visited i mean that we spent hours and hours at each sight while i mapped and logged every important detail while keven must have been doing something in general he was a pretty good sport about it it clearly it was not his thing but what was he gong tor do how we doin it this pont how we getting long at this point in your recollection fine i think there would be times whe we time we i was just not talk or something pretty civilly getting through any frustrations i would not have gone yet d called you names i do not think not yet every night ended the exact same way with me studying and compulsively writing notes in my journal laid into the night with the light on while keven tried to sleep he complained about it constantly as if turning out the lights was more important than what i was writing i just kept writing i felt the answers that i needed could be parsed later from the details that i wrote and not an a new agy way i mean in a real anther pological way i kept writing and i drew a tin too these really intricate field sketches of aztec and myon designs and then i mapped out all these ancient cities there was no reason for this all of the cities had already been mapped by actual archaeologists also i had at kamera i took hundreds of pictures keven appeers in three of them it this point if you were going to write a letter your best friend a postgard your best friend about your brother what would it have said the postcart i'm sure would say havent fine travelling through mexico but my brother's pretty much in a i'm getgettin kii ill probably would as time getting tind of sick of him but i'm sure we cadn get through this no the next fune place ahead one day haven met a girl about his age she was mexican all i remember about hers that she spoke some english and she had a small head keven introduced me and i was probably just my nown hitself she told kevan your brother as really son girn which i learned later that night means arrogant keven revelled in a great many retellings of that he loved letting me know that everybody thought i was prick for some reason this particular jab from the small headed girl really hit me hard as i normally had to work a little to make people dislike me but i had not done that with her she could tell that i was an arrogan jerkin my normal resting state songron became kevan's new favourite word when we argued it drove me crazy but even when keven was happy he was driving me crazy now his whold cheerful surferb stoked to be around people thing it is funny though as i remember as a little kid i was the same way and second grate the teacher wrote a comment in my reportcard that said i was a bubbly student that night when our stepfather got home from the machine shop and read at i got beat he said he knew what the teacher meant that i was a loud mouth i changed we spent a few days in mexico city and worked our way suth to wahaka on little toolane roads and muddy trails ceven suggested that maybe we should skip some of the more remote ruins and had straight for the beach and i told him no way we crossed the isthimus and over to the ruins and compacha and ucatan just on it seeing that keven was ready to mute me we were saved by our next stop on the map and coon drinking a night life and beautiful beaeches and i scuba and snorcoing and beautiful water cancoon was amazing in those days just thas coribian paradise and lots of ruins but it was ocay i was certain we could see and do it all iu got the days in cancoon might ave been the best of the entire trip we were both excited to get out to the islands there was that ilin just off shore colled eastlom headas which sounda great to me then you more ad i spent women we got on some sort of i just we did not bring the car we just went out there ourselves no car a feiry out there i think and then on you we got there pretty wait i want to say long day we found kind of a real quiet bar and ser drinking putting down some drinks and then it was time to go up to our hotel which as a fairly meager hotel nothing fancy and i start turning in for the night and you have making notations in your journal and i it got to an argument in that hotel that night where i pretty much let my mouth fly and i said all the things i felt n wich included you think you are cool you think you are much better than every one around here i'm and i'm sure included and that was youre a fuckan idiot you are fcking idiot you are fucking not as cool as you think you are and i went to the pemples on your face i went to the chicks you had chosen i went to how you treat everybody shit and you still did not get up out of that bed or stop writing in your book and it was a volcano erupting out of my mouthtime i wald not stop i would not stop and i got you grinding your teeth and standing up and you said i'm going to fuckin hit you if you say another word i think it was that and i course just said probably one of the slowest fuck youse and thats pretty much when i got a slug rit to the wip ad say good fat wip fly backwards all talrak fell when i flew back and i stood up ttall but i did not hit mack i just let that mouth go somemore that did not hurt do it agin do it again fuck you fucking does not hurt does not hurt every horted thing that he said in that room i knew he was right i agreed with him i punished him bad threw him into a night stand shattered a lamp up ended a bed there was blood the door was locked with the mattresso we escaped out the window ran down to the courtyard outside the hotel next door was a jungle jim the way i remember it my recollection you were yelling for me to get away from you you were running around the jungle jim on the opposite side cause you thought i was coming back for you more and i was trying to say no o kno you do not understand i'm i should not a done that i i i'm sorry over and over i apologized to kevin swore it would never happened again but it was too late kevan was done i was one hundred persent down to weave because i did have the control at that moment that was the one thing i could control i could control same i want to weave i just did not want to be with on that trip any more i just did not want to be with you any more it was not the environment we were in it was you i had told you when we got in a fight i know you remember thas i sayss never going to be the same between us that is it it is over never going to respect you never going to be the same again you call me up i want even you kdont probit that time ow sam would not talked to you but i i the next day i remember your face and i knew your emotions well you were sorry and you were sad that things were not going to be the same you knew it you said i know they will not the next morning we got back on the ferry and then drove without a word to the cancoon airport where we bought kevan a one way ticket to san diego i continued on alone to beliese ind guatomalland then turned back up to mexico where i stayed for the next four years my mailing address was least od at gores just general delivery i did not have a phone was not on purpose almost nobody in the town had phones but also i did not want a phone kep myself off almost entirely from my family not just during the years in mexico but even after i returned kevan had been the very last person left standing in my corner and this trip at mis in hindsight and lik e a bridge to fix things back home to show that i was not such a bad guy instead it only proved what i'd always feared i wasn a bad guy whut i did not know through all this time was that kevan actually did get over this stuff quickly pretty much as soon as he got back to sandiego he had said things would never be the same but never means something differen to a sixteen year old kid nd i guess i'm not surprised kevin's over it he is not one of those pricks who hold to grudge i'm the one who could not let it go any of it that trip in mexico for me to hit him to beat him the way that i did after the childhood we had i felt ashamed kevan and i had nevereally sat down and talked about this but i know i let him down not just in mexico long before that all through our childhood there were beatings just this violence every other day when i was nine i saw my stepfather throw kevin face first into the sharp corner of a wall it opened up his forehead much blood kevan was four years old even now almost forty years later sitting in front of him i can barely stand to tell him what happen when we took him to the emergency rom right off the bat stepfather saying i tripped in fell he is bleeding me to get that fixed and they asked long and she gave the company line and then they asked me and i say yat i tripped in fell and it was the olda brother e i had a responsibility i mean regardless of what was beaten out of me i had this responsibility i mean it it ids me now wh i look at your face that you got that i'm thot scar is that scar's a parto you that it is a part that i wish i could forget i bad and and we would go visit dad every other week and and he would ask and i would not say anything i just i would not do it and then our dad did not know what our stepfather was doing to us you until one weekend when keaven was nine ceaven had been beaten badly and he must have said something to dad i do not i d i do not know i was not there i don' what you said well you were there you were there we are going to dad an cathys on cove drie dit and cathy was not there he took a little bit different way we are on a more senic rout from wake side i the six i remember the sunset in the mountain road and i i remember i had just told him that oh ye i got beat for leaving the pain ou and then after getting beat an told to come back out in the living room i spent about forty seconds feelin sorry and train to ac normal that that forty seconds past nigs did not pick up the paint again and i got beat again for not picking up the paint and it just sas i was this electric lick the electrical cord imid fit that time it was back on the knees to the middle of the back the only thing that it took to get us out of that bad situation was for somebody to speak up for me to tell my dad mi real dad the truth about our life at home but i was too afraid to say anything i said nothing and this fact more than most any other makes me hate myself as i was the big brother it was my responsibility to speak up to protect keaven instead he is the one who stood up he is the one who told her dad and heat called see piaz he called the police they took polaroyds in a room of my bear ass and back and and we sat around at table and said the police meant assed as i want you would a name every time you have been beat that was the table there on cove drive that dinner table and we looked a each otherlie oh do you have a while and for years after that conversation for years may be dackate i thought of what i had forgot to tell that kind oh i never mention that time and i know riht away that i had not mention that just it would poping to mangl i did not mention that telling kelvin that i was sorry about the fight in mexico that was one thing talking about the stuff that happened when we were little but i did not do apologizing for not protecting him as a kid that is what i really needed to say to him but the past twenty years i'd lived half an hour from keaven he invites me to stuff all the time i do not go and i'm not much of an inviter i do not see him much or the rest of the family either our past is always held me back i've got a lot of regret i kind of sad to hear that you have much remorse oer it i do not blame you for it and i do not blame you for being older and should have known better that is something out long time ago and id do not want you to a be tortured by you re passed i hope i have not done anything to continue the torture your loved i'm a different person tha ll than i wasnat tpwenty one mostly it took a long time to get my carmess strate but i'm still not a guid s con to start a conversation with you on an elevator and i'd rather yu did not either also i waited a long time but i'm married now i have a daughter who is nine and a son whos seven they have

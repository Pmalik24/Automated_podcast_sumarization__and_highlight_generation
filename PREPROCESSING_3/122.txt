democrats ranging from burney standers togeve an newsom are waiting in the wings for jobidon to fall down on the job jerom pael spells out an unclear path ford on inflation and we examine the latest republican poles and benshgur the sist bench buro show benshpirishrosponserba expressvepien protector all my pravsy today expressivepians i com flashmen jobinen isplaying a very very dangerous game i'm just mean with regard to his presidential run against the presumptive republican nomineewright now donall trom i mean with regard to his own partyes jobidon is non existent as just a human being according to the republican at national committee jobiden has spend twenty three of the past thirty days on vacation later this week he is going back tor hubof beech for more his entire strategy as a president of the united states is now apparently the same stragy used in getting to the presidency which is hide in a basement in delaware and just stay there an everyso offin they open the coffin and they rolled joe on out and then they macinate his mouth for him and then they move him back in to his coffin then the door shuts hanclick but here is the problem the're lot of democrats were arem particularly satisfied with all of this particularlybecause the person who is backing up jobidon is also wildly on popular in comela harris republicans are not just going to run against jobi and theyre also oing to run against the person who presumptibly will pick up the pieceis when god forbid something happens to the curent presidents of the united states this is wy presumably you have burney sanders back in new hampshire over the week en burney has no business in new hampshire the ownerison for burningto be new hampshire is because he thinks maybe just maybe jobi nane can be around if it is time to run for president again and everybody has talked about the gavea nuwsums of the worldll gets him in a moment everytocsby comela haris people forget that the person who won iwi and new hampshire in the last democratic primary season was neither of those two characters comela harrs dropped out before weven hi california the person who won was burney and if it had not been for the entire democratic party in for structure coming together to stop burney standrs from winning the nomination they literally all got together then they all endorsed jobidon simultaneously if that does not happen burney standers is the nomine for the democratic party and there is every belief that donal from wins re election over burney standers o burney is getting active again and i got a tellyou commun is 'm must be amasing for your frare blood because apparently being a complete leech on other people for your entire life which is burney standers's story one most useless people in all american history burney sander's entire life has been built oround useless uselessness taking american public dollars and all the he is just the workers and burney is back in new hampshire over the week en he delivered a speech entitled the agenda american needs at saint anselmat colege is new hampshire institute of politics he said this will lay out a concredto genda which speaks to the needs of the long neglected working class and that he put out a statement sayng i've always believes a good public policy is good politics the american people are increasingly discusted at the growing levels of in com an wealth in quolity in our country and the rampant corpri greed we are seeing all this is as sparking some speculation see an enstan intervie with burney over the wee gan hers wat he had to say is that o pro goin to tefant the creeping authoritarian is an an rit wing extrameis tan there has to be an ideological change of course can explain what you mean by that well what i me by that that a is that the president hass a right to be very proud a many of the accomplishments that we pecheeved in the last threas on employment very very low report in flation down werevestthing in clean energy were rebuilding our infar struck thu a we have made real progress an a number of verias but the reality is that to day six peo persenth upo people living pacuct the pathuk we have bats of levels of incommon wealth an equality three people or more wealth an the bottomhaf of a mericle it burney that this is the language of a person who wants to campaign a as new hampsturns totapolitics executive director at novesk told the chrisantines moner sait we invited him but he has coming here for reason iving an opens the door for a lot of other sorts of thoughts about whether or not bidn's going to be the nominyt whether or not bidingis going be running in next years a presidential election now bidin i burney has set over and over an overhis gen back bidon but again it seems as though there is now that the door is now open to democrats openly talking about what happens if jobidon does not survive and this as been sort of ferboton and there is been i i and a ixnay on the talking about jobidon to elfhaig the just do not talk about it and it will go away but now it is perfectly obvious to everyone that jobidon his ailing and even burney sanders by theway is older than jobiton burney sanders is eighty one years old burney is notchus con t give up the ghost right here he looks to that field he says well i have morva supportbas nationally than gavan newsum and the possibility that burney could theoretically be waiting in the wings forgetly i do not thing anys people oin jumetin to rectly against jobidon unless jobidon has some sort of serious healthscare but ones to god i mean it seems day to day the possibility of jobidon having serious healtscares fifty per cent every time that man has a press conferenc yore waiting for him for guod forbid something to happen to the gern president bof the unit ed states yo on anything bad to happen anybody for health reasons but if you are democrat waitig in the wings right nown you look at jobidon and they are hiding him ony beach bi himself trying to stop the old man from getting covit or something you have to be thinking well who is backing him up and no one is happing with comel harrits despite the attempt by politico to sort of revive the the enthusiasm that never existed around commla harris burney maybe back in the bolgame meanwhile everybody is pretty pretty clear on the fact that gavin newsum is waitin in the wings as well have nuwsom is been running a shadow campaign it is wi 's been running against ronto santis according to enbysey news newsum is increasingly being vutos an newsance by some of presiden jobidn's political adbisers accordig to for people familiar a t matter the bidan's camno longer sees nuwsum is o want to be challenger newsum's plans to dobate flor to governor ron to san on tev carries more risk than potential reward according to those people this cause consternation within bidon's operat sion and particularly among vice president comela harriss allas i should cause conscterdation with comela harris the notion that of comela harris were the airaparent to jobide known when cawlenger is nonsense every one would challenger the number people in the race of comea harris is the prisump to err to jobidon is insane in the that place can be more crowded then the u s open this week end an men it is it is totally crazy some bidn advisers have complain privately the plan debate could make voters think newsen as running a shato twenty twenty four campaign at a time en most democratsay they prefer a different candidate at the top of the ticket the ouse argue could elevate to santis whom white house visers initially perceived as a greater threat to biden's re election hopes than the jo p front runner form president donall trunp halas allot harris allies take prersticularly onbrage ot what they see as new soms attempt o position himself for the twenty twenty eight democratic presidential primariily at her expense s again therre wat a democrats and their champing at the bits to go after jobidon and at least after people who had come after jobidon there is reason jobidonsteam is hiding him away in just one second we will gets the continued

the contversy continues to swirrel over the failures of the biding ad ministration all of the in vestigation surrounding le gality of what jobidon has been doing those are not simply going to go away in fact there is an article in the euroke post over the week end at's pretty dicy with regard to jacksmith jacksmith is of course the special council who is appointed to go after donal trump and multible cases he is got the florida case over down from s miss handling allegedly of class fi documents and hes got the january six case up in washington d see well nowl according to the yuropost to turns out the white house councils offics met with a top aid two special council jacksmith just wees be fore he brought charges against former president trum for ledgedly miss handling classfi tdocuments raising series concerns about coordinated legal efforts aimed at president bidens likely opponent in twenty twenty four j bratt who join the special counciltem a november twenty twenty two shortly after was form took a meeting in the white house on march thirty first twenty tmarch thirty first t wenty twenty three with caroline saba the deputy cheep of staff of the white house councils office according to white house visitor logs threwere joined in the tennameeting by danuel ray and afpia agents in the washington field office nine weeks later trump was invite investsmith's office on june eighth twenty twenty three brad whos sixty three also met with sabo a the wite house n november twenty twenty one when trump was mired in negotiations with the national archives brad had a third meetig inth wite house oftember twenty twenty one this with catheron rily in inviser to the white houseis chief of staff office it is not clear what exactly was dis cossed bot critics in legal experts are quostcuning whybrat was taking meetings at all with the white house councils office while part of an active investigation into pressent an bidons likely twenty twenty four publican opponent i vas thog rujuliane is fighting madbagsas theres no legitimate purpose for a deo ja gi to be meeting wit the white house except of its coordinated at the highest levels juliani said that he believes that obviously this to some sort of coordination george washington university lap ovesser jonathan tfrally said that the meting was particularly troublesome and raises obvious concerns about visits to the white house after brab began his work with the special council he said there is no reason why the deogatiould not be ableto confirm whether this meeting was related to the ongoing investigation or concerns some ofther matter now theoretically at could concern some other matter but the fact is tht when you have meetings between the people who are proscuting donald trump and members of the white house staff that is not something that a special councils office should be doing quite obviously meanwhile on the other side of the ledger the congressional investigations into joe and hunter bidon continue cavemac carthy overthe weekunspeaker the house he was asked about shutting down investigations in to hunter or jobidny set of corsom not doing that walk a the your senario is that you ex fact do not you think we will see a short term continuing resolution while you finish the appropriations process but one of our goals is to change washington wore tired of these omnibus bills were congress does not do their work their propriation in the death ceiling we put a provision in there if you did not dong your job there was one per cent cut across the board omade a lot of members mad but they are actually doing their work i do not believe we will have enough time to pash all the appropriation bills by september thirtieth i would actually to have a short term cy ar only to make our argument stronger because maria if we shut down all the government shots at down investigation of everything else it hurts the american public but if we are able to pass our ppropriation bills we are in a stronger position to remove those those polocy policies that are locked in to lall right nolt na the investigation into hunter is going to be on going from congress as well it should be victor shokin whos the center of a lot of this controverse you remember victor shokin he was the former topucrane prosecutor who is targeted by jobidon as well as by berrizma now jobidon's claim is that the reason he got schoke and fired in yu craine is because thereis international consternation over victor schok in having the power that he did that he was corrupt in ats the reason the jobidon was doing all of that brisman was at the same time lobbying for shokin to be gone because he was investigating brizma his claim is the reason that jobidon did it is because he was investig tting berizma hunter bide was on the bordeberisma and sobidan suddenly took a machical interest in his prarticular job over the weeken he did not interview with bryng komeed in which he talked about why he thinks he was fired victorshokin why were you fired from your prosition by presen preschenkko no youn i have said repeatedly in my theintofuse that wcashanko bire me shav the inians o the than wis a tan malitem wesause i wasn'nvestogatin terisma the present presheko tell you that the he wanted cuto stay on the job but there was presshure from present vice presen bide we nosechusion a an a you ought to sut me correctly this is how it was a there were no complaints wat soi wen o mos wa o i was formin at a my co becaus crason was repeatedly put on present fashanko a that is wha ane t in no hen firing me he says the reason i oversaw the beriseman case was because i was proscutor general breismosan ordinary case there is nothing particularly diffent about it th reason o tandling it is because hit deserved o special mention it was on a list of cases to marispecial attention tbecause hunter biden was involved the beriseman of course his father the vice president bidn at the time oversaw ou krane affairs for the whitehouse this is why he also added he had no doubt berise most engaged in in legal activities and said itwould half a day to explain themall among the allegations he said the berizemenht legally produe sold and utilized natural gas supplies this going to fox news is ays i've no doubt the relegal activities engaged in by brisma as a matter of fact the criminal case had ben started before me it continued to explain ans lovchevsky with the time held the post of minister and was the founder in c oberisma start bringin people who could provide protection for him hunter bin was among them the coruption ot work expanded as results agestagainsterior question there is no doubt i my mind berizmost engaged in illegal activities now as foxnews point dout it is pretty obvious that hunter cal d c to work on shokin howsover si commttee chirman chames commersack what when berizema's owner was fasing pressur from the ucranian prosecure investigating company for corruption deven archer who was hunter by ans fore business partner tustified the beriseme executives asked hunter tho call d c after berizmon board meeting in tuby anfoxnewsditional reported that on na vember sectonds whenty fifteen beriseme executive vatan pozarsky e maled hunter bid an archer and fellow hunter associate ark schwerin abotter of vise proposal contract and initial invois for berisma holding from lobbying from bluestar strategies hunter a portedly connectedbrisemet with bluestar strategies to help the energy from fight corruption charges levied against lovchevsky the company's owner an pasharsky emphasized in that hemel the ultiment purpose of the agreement was to shut down any cases or pursuits against t at nickoli in eu kran that' be s lovchevsky a i get in beshokin also went on he ancusely bidins of actually taking bribes he said i i continued to oversee theberisma investigation we would hav found the fact about the orupt activities there engaging in that included both hunter bidan and av an archer and others e said i doft want a deal an on provin facts my firm personal conviction is yes this was th e case they were being bribe the fact that jobidon gave way one billion dollars in you os money an exchange for ban his missile my firing alone is not that a case of gruption i mean the answer is yes men the only question there is whether jobidon is able to hide his motivation which maybeen over breezmop by saying that everybody wanted chokan fired anyway but two things can beu tro once everbody want to cho can fired and the real reason that jobine was interested in chokin to the poin where he was calling up the president of ou crane and actually sending e mells from a secr to count two bidon in to hunter over ou crane the reason maybe he took a special interest maybe it is because of the fact that his son was working for breezmuk at the time all this i's not that not by a long shot other democrats know it is why there is little but o blood in the water with regard to the curn president of the united states oka were gn get to more on this race in just one second particularly with regard to the economy which it is very unclearish way the economy is going to go i have my doubts first we have a wonderful dog his name is happy yesterday he had a wonderful time we took him out his meeting all of the other dogs is being extremely cued my kinsle of him which is why want him to live long and happy life this is why we give him rough greens every morning the dog for you been giving t your dog while it is dead food it does not have that

o case meanwhile the economy continues to b on sort of the edge here jerome pele give a speech ind jackson hole over the weekgen he is the head of the federal reserv an i will say it once again the fact that our entire economy is run by a small cabal of human beings for preside over massive enormous globull economy breaking power with regard to central banking is despicable it really is despicable the gold standard used to take this directly out of the hands of burocratic qonnquat experts and i sayig these people are uniquely bad but i am sayng is the system of insentives is uniquelly bad the fact that federalreservers been tassd with simultaneously keeping in flation lo and keeping employment high he used to be tha that was the job of legislyturs that was the job and now when you handed off to the federl reserve basically their job is to continue to back fill all the bad legislation comm and of washington to see fysical responsibility can only happen when you do not tave a bunch of central bankers for manipulating the switchis behind the scenes in any case jerome pawe who everybody now watches u watch ap capal con clave after we trying to pic a new pope an your's waiting for the smoke will merge and that is how we now watch thse economic ofvents which is insane jerome powell and a room in jackson why eming because this is how again our mackreconomics is now done he give a speech talking about inflation and the interestrates lot of people ore worried particularly that the federal reserve in the central banks across the world are going to continue to raise those interestratesion efforts to quell in flation an doing they are basically going to clamp down on the ability of lenders to lends they are going to increase standards four lenders because the money are not gon to be quite as easy to recoop andi and their frid that will tip us over into recession here is jgerone powel over the weken to per cent is and will remain our n flation target we are committed to achieving and sustain sustaining a stanceofmlanitory policy tht is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to that level over time it is challenging of course to know in real time when such astanc has been achieved i gam meanwhile he says is he any givany guidance and we we all know that he wantso ring in flation down to swo per cent that is always the targe rade for the federal reserve which by the way is not in nof its ofphemoral not the must point out that he two per cent in flacienrate over the course of fifty years is an one hundred percentin plation ray which jus why everythng is way more expensive in just pure dollar terms than it used to be the fact that we deliberately in fleet to currency in order to artificially job con sumer spending in this country is a is is what wee call i nich ashonda it is something that is shameful we hould not be doing this weare actively degrading peoples savings in order to jog fak consumer spending which does not actually generate innovation by the way what generates inovation is investment what generates inovation is it are indeed what generates inovation is not you buying inditional hammigr today that does not generate the new products and services than make the world they better playes in any case jerome powell then gave very little guidance e basicalle just kind of said wellg we do not know you do not know nobody knows as is often the case we are navigating by the stars under cloudy skise it is such circumstances risk management considerations ar critical at up coming meetings we will assess our progress based on the totality of the data and the evolving out look and risks based on the a sessment we will preceed carefully as we decide whether to tiht further or instead to hold the policy rade

annalis an investor said it was not music the ears of many of the portfolio managers who have been crossing ther fingers the fastest reet cycle in decades is finally at an end stocks rose friday afternoon a rare advancing in ougust slog for yous indicease but futures markets showed a greater expectation rates could stay hirer for longer they well hav he is rates are not going anywhere for a bet atd what point dies the bon market provide competitions to the stock market in the eyesminvestors said david denabetian the chief investment officer of s ib c private wealth you ass are they the idea would be the stock market right now is a is still inflated alilibit although you us indicees remain in the green for the year this month has been difficult for investors in riskier air assets signs of continued strength in yu us economy a flood of tresery that sails expectations thef fet could keep it hirer rates hirer for longer lifted government bond yelds to decate at plus hies trater's on friday assigned of fifty four per cent probability to the central bank lifting rates again by the end of the year that is up from thirty two per cent that they estimated a week earlier again the fact that everybody is now sitting or round and reading chicken an trails is to what a bunch of central bankers are goingto do with the rates is absurd there is a natural rates of inflation the natural rate of inflation occurs based on products and services and productivity there is a natural rates to lending a natural intrestrates exist theyre different from economy to economy they are not consistent they should not be set by any centural point it is amazing that many of the same at free market economic thinkers who understand then no one codrate of people is capable of setting price is in literally any other area of theamerican economy believes that there is a cotor of people who should be setting the price of debt that is totally insane it is is not just people i meu believe this mahoanal arian af oleons he bere ta book along timeago called the only game in town all about how basedly central banks now control virtually all of the economic policy well then't gun be able to save and that is creat such a set of perversan sentevs the pervers in cent of is if you are member of the legislature just spend endlessly hoping the federoserve wut is gon a comin mommy and kiss the booboo that is basidly jerom's powl job e probmam is that means that everybody else out here who is trying to invest do not have an idea what your own powel is going to do to morrow it is sitting round waiting for this guid of figure out exactly what the plan is for all the rest of our lives and your ant hae a say in it becase it is not n elected position the fact that there is not more hue and cry about the outsize powers the feder reserve is absolutely beyond me especially because is not is those central bankers note to hel their doing again iwhen every of a small cotra of experts who say that they kn ll exactly what they are doing that is almost never the case according to the walster jurnal central bankers from around the world are finally getting inflacion slow down theyv been expecting but they worry will not last that apprehension explaind the uneasy optimismunderlying their discussions here in the wy oming mountains this weekand about weather interestrates have reached ta summit federals orve officials are grappling with new economic cross currents youus consumer spending has grown faster than they expected to recent monts boe by hirer and flation ajusted wages stronger demand prompted concerns it might prevent inflation from falling further but a recent surgeon long from goverment boned yields combined with weakening growth abroad could help touch off a youus economic slow down fedificials have ben trying to engineer by raising rates aggressively over the past eighteen months the problem is once you tip over that cliff you do not know what is yot how far down it is meanwhile china they have destroyed their own economy thet men doing that over the course of last we decades ha ein hiding it with fake growth numberis based largely on borrowing extrordinary sums of money than spending it on empty cities whell now according to the walster jurnal ideology is driving chinas economic policy to agree not scene since the countries opening to the west nearly half a sentury go ti turring its leaders from taking steps to spur the sputtering economy sa used to be that when chinagottn trouble they might tri little free market stuff not any more h economists and investers o ben calling on bashings make bolder efforts to boost to output especially by promoting consumer spending if necessary by offering cashandouts as the us did during the pandemic but top leaders susian pang has deep rooted philosophical objections to western style con sumption at driven growth people familiar with decision making in masing say she sees at such growth as wasteful and at odds with is go of making china world leading industrial and technological power house now the way that china could theoretically do that is open up but the not got opit up sinestead the're jus canto follow this corporatiust path mut's o mazing is that the same corporous path thet china follows is one democrats an th united states wish to follow it is china that takes hundreds o billions of dollars and jus shovels it into particularl industries in the believe that this will somehow magically fix theire ailing economy jobine mats to do the samething here e calls to by nomics the commonist chinese call it communism but is not either but it really is is corporatism it really is the government picking and choosing prs girl of business sectors or business is as they think oure the most important business sectors are business is and taking money away from most efficions to give to these particular sectors it exists on boot th left in the right by the way and all it really is is favoritism combined with political ideology which is not the way that free market economics is suppoosed to work it does not generate the most efficient levels of growth it does not generate the best outcomes for the vast majority of the population the fact that the wests wishes to copy china as china falls directly into the pit is a is absolutely insane but again the illusion of control is such a it is just desiris for many people in positions o power the illusion that they alone can control they alone can fix tgive me enough power nofll fix the american economy now the answer wheneveryou here presedent of either party say he has created jobs it is a lie the president of the united states is not create jobs neither do congress people you create the jobs in your business i create the jobs in my business we create the jop i know be cause we signed the pachecks over here the fact that the federal govrnment pretends that it creates jobs the federal govement can take awayjobs by destroying the base line preconditions for economic growth and that is one of the thngs that happens when you participate in the economic favoritism in the corporitism that both parties engageint here in the united states and that its engaged in bhy some of the most economically facious countries on the planet by the way all this is having pretty direffects not just on the world heconomy but more specifically on the lower end of the world e conomy you are starring to see a bunch of countryes absolutely collapse in terms of emerging markets emerging markets are specially sensitive to fedfol policy according to the welter jounal because hire ust rates make riskier assets less attractive to investor vory on can investan nigerian bonds if the money is just not is easy and get ready for for all those people who believe that the the markets are on solid footing i have on i have a bridge in brooklan that is forsal at the moment i can meanwhile on the re publican at side of the altoobideim is incredibly vulnerable even democrats ar noticing this which is presumably why you have burning sanders travelling to me hampshire republicans are steaming twenty donnals from nomination there is just now to wast about it right now the twenty twenty four pressidential nomination the up date in the real clopoltic pulling average has donald trump up forty points over the rest of the field there is been some sign that the vac romasuamey is startings receede back to the field that nickey hayley is starting pick up a little bit of ground the solid number two continues to be ron to santis by pety much all the available pulling dater right now he continues to be number two pence is picking up a little bit o ground in some of the latest pulls by a little i mean he is up to five or six per cent in some of the latest puls nobody is within shouting distancs of donald trump after donald trumps pick was took at the at the georgia court house at the fulen county courthouse thit was not the corthouse the jail at the fullin cann jail he raised more money on that day alone than he had the entiredy of the campagn which is both i would say encouraging in the sens thet re publicans are very very motivated and a little bit discouraging in the fact that if you want onal trump to be president trobely should not wan be president just because he took a mug shot nas i said the mungchout as an amazing amazing marketting opportunity for donald trump i talked out on friday it is a great mugshot if there is such a thing it is a great men there are emin frankson otrus most amously ma garg greate and iconic mugshots this an iconic mugshot well trump trurn that georgia mugshot into gold according to politico trump raised seven point one million dollars since he is book at an at lantagail on thursday evening accordng to figures provided first to political by his campaign on friday alone trump raise four point one eight million dollars that is the single highest twenty four hour period of his campaign to dahte according to a person familiar with the totals the campaigns fun raising has ben powerd by murch it is been selling through the otline store which again max ens is all people signalling to each other that they also wished to throw the establishments the giant orange mintal finger the campaign is also been protting on line doners with emails and text messages as well trumps campagn says it is raised nearly twenty million dollars in last three weeks based on the repeated charges against him now as i said last week the polling does not demonstrate that tat donald trump is li cally to win election based on this it demonstrates that he is likely to win the nomination based on the based on the charged against him but the fact is that in most americans unfortunately still believe that trump should stand trial before the twenty twenty four election he has a court deight in georgia to day has nother one in deceit to day all this can be about setting the time line the cort atn te ce is all about setting the jacksmith ganuar sixth case is that can be before the electioner after his steam is trying to argue he shouln't be tried there until twenty twenty six actually which i think is unlikely meanwhile in georgia it is not really about trump but there is a legal case against mark metdows that is on going their mark metdos is trying to have that qart move his case to federal cort and he is then going to claim that basidly the supremacy claws prevents him from being tried in stake quart that whatever crimes he supposedly committed he committed as a federal official is chef of stafftodonal trump and therefore he should be tried in federal quort nine stake qart if trump tried the same thing thautallys fore closed the possibility that he would be tried and convicted in a stake qart and then he would be on the ballet and then you have a real mess of constitutional mess because the president camt pardon himself of a non federal offense but again the polling does not show that the general public over all is in credibly warm towrd donald trumps legal troubles there' some people whoare more warm than they otherwise would ave been but they were cenne loukewarm to begin with at i'm more animated on behalf of trump because the trials than i otherwise would have bee but i voted for trumpet twenty twenty i cant vot from twice you will go the polling data from political and what it shows is that sixty one per cent of americans believe ther trumps election trials should take place be four the election sixty one per cent meanwhile fifty one per cent believe that trump is guilty of ledged trimes in the federal twenty twenty election subversion election case at pens twenty six per cent who say no als are not great numbers meanwhile a plurality of respondence to politicos at a conviction in the case forty four per cent woul have no impact on the likely hto of supporting trump which makes sens agan you figure half those people are pro half thos people are agains but among people who said that the result would in form their vote nearly one third of respond ins thirty two per cent said a conviction would make them less likely to spore trump that includes one third of independence only thirteen per cent of respon is total said a conviction would make them more likely to support trump that figure was more likely re publicans than not and by the way the numbers could go down because as the case drags on in as sort of the shock of trump being inticted drags on it becomes less shocking and more normal and then that shu becomes baked into the cake by the way if you look at at who is considered a a villain in this perticular case here is it here is the polling data again political magzineus os poll deove a favorable or un favorable opinion of the action statement to behavor the following people regarding the cases against trump fifty eight percents on favorable twenty sevene per cent favorable jobidon forty five per cent on favorable thirty six per cent favorable that is a nine point gap negative for bidon that is a twenty nine per cent gap four donal trump right there jack smith to this point still has more favorables than un favorables and sot is the geoge if the ho per is that donald trumps legal cases are going to spur him to the presidency again i thin there is my possibility they spu hm to the nomination but i think that there is a much lower chance that they actually have these sort of counts revailing affectit then a lot people ofe st about in peachmen i've never bought the argument by the way that im peaching somebody attually helps them elect orilly i still have get to see the evidence of that a bilclinton was not peach nineteeninety eight maybe it help democrat's a little bit in sort of mintrm elections it did not help all goran yo thousan and obviously im peaching trump twice didn' rolly may gat difference on behalf of trump in the twenty twenty election either meanwhile there is a case afoot too now truly they you on talk about election interference this would be true election interference against trump llgets that in just at one

about these cases yah thery form of election interferencs forshore no question but here is some actual direct election interference and it is coming from inside ta house going to buyer in york some don trum s enemies are now attempting to have him removed from state primary ballats according to york he says that even thoug conviction tos not legally bared trump from running and winning the hope is there is no way convicted trum could regain the presidency from left but there are some of trumps upponents ware going further they are now exploring the possibility the trump is already disqualified from running for office state election boards or secretaries of state they say can an should simply re move his name from the ballot in their states no need for a hearing a trial legal ruling legeslation or any of the other stuff now how would this magrical sillinus work the magical result occurs proponencsay by way of the fourteenth amendmen section three of the amendment prhipits anyone whoas taken in oath to ap pull the constitution and then engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the united states or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof maver holding public office section three was intended to appli to former confederate officials it has not played any significant roll in american governents since eighteen seventy two and it was basicly a thad letter now some people are sayng mishoul use against from now what is olarious about that is that the entire clain against trump for all the bad stuff that he did between november and january of twenty twenty one the claim is there was no legal basis for might pence to simply throw out state sortified electoral vodes based on nothing in the constitution cancho make that judgment there hastibulic an actual reason that you are doing it but now trumps opponents are tempting to precisely that against him on the state ballats it is absurd is not going to happen if it were to happen would be a complete disaster area for bout the republican party in the country cannot just take people off the ballad without an actual legal reason to take them off the ballad totally craziocan meanwhile rondosantis has paused his campaign because they are bunch of issues in the state of floor particularly this giant storm that is bearing down on the gulf coast according to politico he canselld campaign events this week as majorstorm bears down on the state and also in the aftrmat of this hurrific rasis shooting in jacksonvillit will get to momentarily the santis said during a sunday newsconference is can remain in flord in the coming days because tropical storm idailia is expected to be com a hurricagn to make landfalt along the gulf coast later this week it isays we are locked in on thi frinan at the job don i'm here he was slated to scant campaign in south carolina on monday probably i soon casy will be taking his place at some of those events the santis also went to a vigilans sunday nght for shooting left three people dead insacksonville on saturday before the gunman killed himself de santis began a sunday newsconference by condemning at the shoting herewas rondo santis showing up at a vigil over the weeken and a bunch of idiots started shouting it him because supposedly what th governor of the state is not spose to show up in solidarity with communities that are afflicted by whites to premisis mass killingsi'm i'm confused why you would shout at somebody over this in any case here was to santis and a the hero of this particular story is a democrat council member named jucobe pitmen who steps in here and basicly tells the protestors shut up rall on the same side of this one you are not youlo e ecu to be targeded by people we o the m le mesa yu be fin to put party fo that a vd ad a bapartit is to day aoi do n pat oo ge mis tatit this one o the beatiful things i will say about living in florida and this is why there are dosantis democrats as well in the state of florida is that in florida when it comes to times of actual crisis everybody is on the same side by the way that is the nature of what a community should be is when there is a crisis all the stuff goes to the wayside the fact that the are people who are protesting when this sort of stuff happens and te santis is not responsible in any way for this his response is nopin wackluster is not as though he went no comment and then wen for weak on the beach while all the sort of stuff happen a this was absolte a political good for this city council woman for for doing that believe er not ther members of trump's campaign whoer sheering on all of this nonsense the people who are protesting lor lomer predictably enough who is desperate to be donal trump's press secretary which for entertainment value i would be very very high i will say i shee of course was that was celebrating people yelling at ron dtosantis a for for being terrible enough to show up at this som at this particular event sed i'm glad he was booed he is disin genuous just an absurdity obviously she said while rutlell governor to sance was heckled tat vigil for th victims of shooting in jack'sville florida dollar general to day comments he made back in jely about flors are coming back to bite im in the ass is come on i seriously come on ridiculous kind of stuff put the santis is doing what he is supposed to do he is the governor of florida he is back in the state and ta and he is going to be there overseeing whatever happens with regard to this florida hurricane meanwhile it is worth while noting here that dom again in the state of florida florida is a fascinating and and complex state in i know because i know live here i'm resident and dom now this this particular shoting is is obviously it was motivd by wite su premisy accordng tot walster joronel authorityes and jacksovill florda identified a local twenty one year old sunday as a white gunman who shot and killed three black victims at a dollar general store before killing himself and attack local and federal official said was racially motivated the gunman then shot himself who is carrying a hand gun any military style somoutamoutic rifle with swasto caes e marked on it according to the police the jacksovill sheriff t k waters said this is pretty obviously motivated by a by hatred of blackpeople communiis gratling to understand why this atrossty occurred i erd o us all not to look for sinse and the sensis actr violence ther's no reason or explanation that we will ever account for the shoes esisions nactions the sicthing i deology is not re presentative of the values of this cacinal community though we all of much we are not a community of ay we san ou otit with a good and decent people thi city we resent tis inexcusable violence and the san s ho will not resten tot this inthiscusiis complete every avealable old avenue of accountabily o thineaust gat is perfectly worth while to talk about the ideology of the shooter the shoter did not hav criminal history but in twenty sixteen was named in d domestic disturbance call in twenty seventeen had to i be put on seveing to our hold for mental health evaluation i i will point out at this point that whenever there is e white's premisis shooting we know the motives right away and whenever there is a pretty obviously motivated anti christian shooting say in national tennessee just to take a quick example we still do not have the manifesto of that shooter and it has been how many months since all that happene which seems a bazaar to me at the at the very very least nt the shoting obvious is condemned y every one ranging from president bydon said we must refuse to live in a country or black familye's going to the store blasston's going to school if infere being gun down because the color of their skin which of corse is true govenor to sansis said something similar he aled the shooting herrific and said the the state was offering support to the local authorities but as i say florida is a fascinating and at complex place here was governor o sansis speaking about the shooting florida the state in its people condamn the herrific racially motivated murders perpetrated by a derane scambag a in jackson bill at the dollar general store a perpetrating violence of this kind is unacceptable and targeting people due to their race has no place in the state of florida casen i extend condolence is to the victims of their in their families on behalf of the entire state of florida inso that was his statement meanwhile the sheriff over here i again aman in tkan waters he says he n r you worn't try to blame the guns is not ou the guns that is person is wielding guns thethe story's always about guns thes the people ar that this kis of that got if i take my gun off right now nothing on this count nothinat they will sit there as soon as a wicked person grats te hold at hand gon eso shooting people with it there is a pom the promise indofit ay that is the part of the pess conference the mainstremenyou will never show you they will show you him talk about the whites remisy theyll never tell you that what he sayings that yes it was the shooter who plled the trigger in ther ther lot of lack americans by the way who are very very progun and something that the left wishes to a to obscure meanwhile the rest of the re publican field is em is trying to figure out away to priway some of the sans is support and all f them are wi the held behind trump obviously nicky haley who picked up some ground after her last good debate performance and by the pulling she did have probably the best night of of any one in trms of theamount of movement that her candidase the actually experience shoose aske about presedent trump in him leading the pulsion why what i drop out for trum carrylake she is calling on all of the candidates to pause the campaign to get behind t oll trump because of two applications of the law i si is i suppose you are not considering that i mean i preciate and body tnew on what should happen but we have got a a contry o fave and i'm nok at a thop an till wee favor i think that we look at the fact that were thirty two troyan dollars and dat yofve got crime that thop ye've got a lack of crant paret an the clat ring we have got an open border and that we have thret fathing of theround the world an i think that we need a no canerational water we asten ferie problem t wet are not an philuncion ay she is not gone anywhere now probem is that of course the field can fragment six ways she have got got nickyhailey who presumebly if she continues to show some sort of credibility in the race i sumes hims got at some poin is goingto drop out because you really has no support other than frum some money people if he drops out some that is what i soon will move over to hayley which makes or more competitive an south carolina which ironically makes donal trump a lotmore competitive ind south carolina because if the south caroline primary splits trump to siantist haly trum probably walks away with a nomination fairly easily even if this race gets a lot tighter meanwhile chris cristy continues to double down on the never trumplane thinking the sigona win him new hampshir here was ove the weeken and the trueh is thet we cannot have a convic tid fellin h as or nomany frpresent and expect for going to win and it was really must to matsin partin the bate to me was the i the o then the masrity of my conpediters believe that you can have a convic tiv fellin a as aur nomany for presiden and ta that the seport thatin that yeu could win i that is an impossibility ay i mean that is not wht they were saying on the stage therer thing if he is he nomineans by nal vote for him that is noft quite the same thing as a we think that he is likely to win if all those people on state louht he was likely to win they would be running i assume meanwhile the person sort of running still as donal from shadow is to vacrom swammy i'f a vake in the pulling data has taken some hits since the debate but of course he want s be alightning rod he is lightning rodin heis real campagn isn' for the presidency i'm not sure that he cars i think the idea that he is getting all sortsof voutsized attention means that he is pretty well set up for a san an ohio center run ohiois is place of residence or for being a donal trum cabinet pic or for if he be well he is now in an attempt to a bend over backwards for trump shifted his opinion completely onto trump's behavior after january siex if you look at he is want one of his books one ofhis atest books he talk pecifically about january six an he size that when you lose an election you should just admit you lost an election i he is now changed his opinion radically here is u he was not asked during thede bate lot rather candits for asturing the debate about mik pence his behavior on januar six did he do the righthing in sort ofying the election the answer by thewight is yes unequivocally yes there is no legal basis for mike pence to overturn state sort of fied election results i'm sorry if that hurts feelings that is just the way that it is but a vake has tried tot he is trying to square the circle here and come up with a way of pleasing donald trump and ribpbing my pence even toug he knows perfectly well the mi pence did the right thing on january six here he was saying a thing that makes no sense at all and again vivik is to smart for thus the candidates on stage one day ni' said myture hence tids the right thing on january six do you agree i would have done it very differently i think that there was a historic opportunity that he missed to reunite this country in that window what i would have says this is a moment for a tru national concencea swere there is two elements of what is required for functioning democra say n america on is secure elections and the set cond is a peaceful transfer of power when those things come into conflict that is an opportunity for heroism here is what i would have said whe need single day voting on election day whe ned paper ballats and we eed government issue idea matching the voter file and if we achieve that then we have achieved at victory and we should not have any further complain aboy election integrity it wouc you have gos tents an would as to to k ofafi the election sa in my capacity as president of the senate i would have led through that level of reform then on that condition certifie the election results served it up to the president o president trup than to sign that in the law and on january seventh declare to the re election campaign pursuance to a free an feir election i think that was a miset opportunity but that is the kond of spirit wore gan a need to ou nite this contry rather i sweeping those concerns under the rug just to get this strat his solution was that on genuros ex ave rnowncs prunt trumpspen two months lywing that my pence could unilaterally overturn the election and on ganury sixt he would have not certified the election on the condition that they pass a law doing all the things that i i those things also but that is not what the president of the senate actually does he does not in te shate legislation he is a deciding vote he is not a sentor a but a coring of avake he should go outside his constutional duty he should star proposing legislation my pense not certify the election in defiance of his actual job as the president protime of the senate and then he should at that point sertify the election the next day and this would heal america's conflicts yet don as from tefenly woul man haby wit that prowly now trumpitof said ut can now they' fixed the next election i'm really really happy with th results of this one prowly everythig woul hav gone away wat is heven talking about any the vake is ha very smark ile can kno the vake e's a superhiac yu dude he knows wa better than this and this part of my frestraton with his candidacy is when gain this much credibility this quickly wen gen this much attentions quickly it seems to me that ou have sort of a duty to say honest things nd again his entire campaign is truth he would not done that he knows he would not hav done that come on he knows he would not done that because he literally did not do that o kay i i've spoken with the vake after ganuary sex between generate that is when i actually spend he most time with the vak is between january six and now and the vak he is never talk this way and we literally talk the opposite in his book ucam but that this is ye for for for people to shift with the prevailing winds bothers me and i gan i feel we are time out blown opportunities the vake has an opportunity this sa dued from the outside whos extraordinarily wealthy really really bright and has the opportunity shift the debate and a lott a really fascinating an interesting directions and instead he saying things that he knows are not actually viable or true i think becaue again i i do not think that what he saying is coherent and i thinkhe is coherent guy for exantly he has a piece in the american conservative to day about his forn policy and in i he says i will lead our nation from the bloody follies of neo conservatism and liberal internationalism abroad sort a strategy that a firmatively defends our home land we will be uncle succor no more rather than spending billions projecting power in to global vaccums wo our allies will not spend to maintain it themselves we will put america first again as george washington urged as we re calibrat ind considerour truinterests o first of all e must point out every republican cand and most democratic andidates campaignan exactly sim language virshally no one campaignes on the language of unlimited spending on foreign policy and intervention is meverywhere brokoboma did not campagn on that to thousn't eiht georshall be bushn campaign on that into thousand the only candidate i can think of whoashlly campaign sort of that was maccan into thousn't eht but every other candidate of my lifetime has campaign in exactly the way that vevake is now talking about the part is in have proble with any of this that the problem that i have with this is that he seems to believe that just random things happen in form policy for example here is his solutions toou cranow here is my positinucrim abse chinycrane is that the united state should be takin the leadership position in negotiations with the russians who should basily be saying to the russians we are willing to allow you to maintain occupanc of crimea and part of the don bas retion in return we are going to give security guarantines but not nato membership to the eucranians and that is can be the end of the war vevake wants to go one step further in a way that i do not think is even plausible a here is what he sas is i will go to moscow and twenty wenty five i will deliver piecing youcrane only under the terms that shoul mattertus terms the put american interest first the by dministration is foolishly try to get g to dun pooton right china's dum brussia in reality we should get pooten to tump g okane now a no i'm s cn put that out nope russia is a giant gas station with nukly weapons that is its entire economy you think they are going to dump china that that is not a thing that is going to happen it is a week state with no international tizes sining a piece agreement with russia is not going to restore those international ties to the extent necessary that russia would suddenly magically si to dump chinaquot a good deal require us all partes o get something out of it to that end i wilaccept to russian control of the occupied territories and ledge to block you cranes candidaty fernato in exchange russia ecceting its military lines with chindy no russias goin to do not that tenni can exetor military lines with china why that hell would they chin is the only competitive power on the world stage to the united states an then meanwhile he says for example that he is going to he is going to reclear economic an appens from china which is fine and then he says that he is going to be clearer with regard to tiwan his take on tiwan is he sys that we ave operated in strateachicambiguity with the grardti wan for far too long i'll move to tr to stratechi clarity by which ime in the chinamustunderstand i will defend american interest in ti wan if tim wone wants any partnership in their defens they will men to raise their defene spending and military readiness to acceptable levels meanwhile i'll commit to making shrsti wane has the weapons they need for that defence butl from a seaborn invasion and in the future for long frm insurgency against any occuping forn force if needed aget that now there is only one e problet that that is our curent policy that is exactly are carn policy that is str teach a campiguity by the way that we will arm them but we are not did i miss the part in that paragraphory says whether we will actually actively defenti wan in case of a chinese invasion i did not ye this kind of stuff from of ache it is the reason why he his sorge who is base on the idea that he was a free radical he could say whatever he wants it and then it appures that he is now saying things he is got a labt audience capture it seems he is saying things hathe wants people to think he beleases but it seems unlikely that u that he actually believes those thingsand i thnk that is one of the things that came off on the stage the other night for vague my recommendation to him in this campaign if he actually wants take it yno as a presidential candidate is stop trying to please president trom personally and start actively saying the things that people need to heare becase i think he has the strength of character to do all those things ha meanwhile let us do some less you some things i in some things that i hate things that i over the weeken i ready a yo my my sort of brain relaxation is sports i'm a big basket balfan rich coen who is one o my favorite writers wrote a great sports book called when the game was war it comes out this week i it really is fantastic i thi's my early childhood it isabout the eighty seven eighty eights hes and ous only three or four years old but i remember all o these players because they all continue to plain till the early nights that is bird magic jeordiniz a tom as charles barkley andall the rest and the book is just a fun fun ry because riche is a terrific writer it moves really fast and done it it reminds you of a time when o basketball was was less about the pretty and much more about the gritty it is it is it is a lot of fun i i again highly recommended when the game was war by rich goner kay another thing that i environmentalists they think that' somehow there cn a gain support for their cause by being incredibly annoying superdupberinois what if i glew myself o this van go painting in everis it i hope that they just dump you into the river i'll be what what if i what if i just take this road and shut it down orb i's what if we just you known let people run you over because you are annoyying you are very very annoying he we wants him wen to die but come on get off the road in any case these idiots in evada decided to u to shut down a road in evada with sins abolishe capitalism ut capitalism unfortunately for them was not abolished and instead they were abolished basically tribl rangers were not what you are holding up the line and that hear's what occurred er ys the good stuff right there come back fon eterm ere come i asi is yel beter estin as well they should be and i good for the egood for the trabl rangems by which sill lonicars stupid jackout blocking first of all whenever there this sort of stuff happens people shutting down traffic and it does not matter the country does not mtter the timing stop shutting down traffic it is ubnoxious not only 's ob noxious cause other people have livesyou are not the only person with life but also it is sometimes creetes a medical hazards because sometimes there is an ambulence on the way to somewhere stupididious it my only regret here is that a they din't to it earlier bu good good good for them already we will do a quick thing that i hate jensoky has ben maintaining that no one is in favor of late from abortion which is weard because you all want late term abortion i noticed i she treated out on emasin be s she would tweated out a va x no one supports abortion up until birth s which i treated excellent please name legislation you would prep youd provide in orde to prevent abortion up until birth she did not answer that question because sju'st now in answer hure she was trying to explain herself gensoki no one supports abortion up untill birth i wrather because there is a pervasive and misleading talking point that its aced by a number of frightling leaders in clitting presidential candidate on the stage suggest think that democrats are advocating for and even rooting for late time abortions ha bamies who could live outside the wome just take a listen to some of the answers in the debate on wensday nigh we are better than what the democrats ar salling we are not in alow aortion all the way atill bir and we wil hold them acountable for their extreme as at we can not let states cowpon you new york in ill anor hapabortions on the man opin ti the be bu birth how wit lonit is for somewhere to have bidnan comly hair arday for thirty eight week thirday for thirty nide wak thirday for forty weeks this was not just some throwway line for a plaus on the debate tage this is a talking point republican presidential candidates t is repeatedly on the trail yet i'm because it is true nowhere in the segmen does she actually rebut the idea that she would support legislation leglizing o abortion until birth instead just goes s what it does not happen all that often that is not the question the question is not with her abortion happens all that often close to birth the question is should it happen at all and now what point you to become illegal and she will not answer those question an neither will any other democrat because the democratic party position is there shall be no legislation thet restricts abortion at any point up until birth that is the democratic party position and yet sjust denies it outright it is an amazing thing iit must be fun to have your taken neto to that way where were you clearly oppose any restrictions on abortion and then when you are called on it yor yabit i do not but i on't it well that do not care with you personally it i care whether you wish to make it illegal or not we are in the business of public policy are we not it is it is dishonest but yot nw she is to work for bitan there you have it ir deguise the rest of the shows continuing right now you are not con one a miss it we willbe getting into the mail bag ifyofrenot a member become

former star baseball pitch or trever bower releases damning details concerning sexual assault alligations against him donal trump has to man had not to attend his simil fraud trial tand a person apparently named tailor swift is repordly dating another person apparently named travis celsi i'm been shpir of this is the benish parro show to day shos ponserd baexspressvepien thousandsof my licers of already securedtheir networ day tod join them express pepiandicom flash men the me two movement was predicated on one truth and a lot of lies the one truth is that men sometimes really mistreat women and women do not report that mis treatment out of fear of retalliation and that men's crimes against women have spand the generations and been really terrible and that men have not been sufficiently punished for this not as a class individually thereare lot of cases which men abuse women and tat does not go reported because women do not coming forward those alligations cause the tay go through the lime light and and men get away with it all of that is true and it was particularly true in holliwood which is where the me two movemen originally started becaue the casting couch is indeed a thing in holliwood and that leads to sexual exploitation this has been a thing allwaysins the beginnings of holliwood in fact onn have stockbot holliwood an go all the way back throughot human history what you see is that men with power very often abuse women that was then surrounded with a bigger lie and the bigger lie was believe all women me to which was the idea that virtually all women had been abused at sompoint o other which is not true was then surrounded with an even bigger li which is that any accusation was tanned tomount to a conviction any time a women said that shos abused by a man we had to take this not only seriously which we should but we had to pretend that no further evidence was necessary or needed no woman would under any circumstances lie about something this for any level of game in fact there would be no level of game that would be concominent to actually explain why a woman would make a false accusation now there is no other area of human life orwe makes such a a claim it jus does not exist where in in accusation is tanned tomount to proof we tried to do it a little bit in the united states over the past ten twenty years with regard to racial alligations and turns out that that just in sendivises people to make false racial alligations this itaw yu end up with the justy smalet story oll the same thing is true with regard to a movement that is predicated on the idea tht no matter what a women says it must be true wregardless of what the evidence shows now there bee a lot of cases of me two stories blowing up in in people's faces me two stories that that ouen't really mee two stories being blown out of proportion for example as hes unsorry or me two alligations thereabout a man acting rudely or badly but do not really amount to sexual assault sexual violence and and gain that that sort of conflation that flattening out of all human behavior is stupid and wrong but the worst case that i have ever seen just broke to day this is the case of trever bowers or trever bower is a is a baseball pitchur he is earn hundreds millies of dollars playing baseball he was signed by the elle dogers backin twenty twenty one twith three ear contract worth a hundred million dollars and he had been the the man stay of the rotation and in all g st of twenty twenty one suddenly therer a a there wis an accusation that came out that he had sectually abused woman and this turned in to a few more accusations of sexual abuse the accusations broke on june thirtieth twenty twenty one the passig in a police department confirmed to newsoutlets according to wiccapedia that bower was under investigation for the alleged assault of a sandego woman in may the woman was granted a temporary to messic restraining order on june twenty eighth alleging she had met bower on april twenty first and that she ad been physically and sectually assaulted by him on two separat occasions she alleged that he had sotomized er without consent punctur in the face choked her to the points of unconsciousness on may sixteenth she wents the emergency room at alverado hospital where after her injuries were examined she meut with several detective from the san diego police department ammell be an response placed bower on administrative leave on july second and the dodgers removed erchandise from that teem store that had bowers name on it bower said he had sectual consent with the accuser and that his accuser sentime a tex mssage requesting he inflict pain on her he is an id certain specific aspects of the alligations on august twentieth a temporary restraining order against power was removed after bower was determin not to octually pose athreat to the woman safety the judge found the woman was qu was not ambiguous about wanting rough sec in the parties first encounter and wanting rougher sect in the second encounter andthe bower had honored t e woman's boundaries when she set them am mel be then extended his leave for the rest of the season while they finished their in vestigation debower and then february a twenty twenty two the alle county district atturny's office announced they wouldn' bring any criminal charge against bower now that should have already theire sribin lic a thousand red flags of this point in terms of this case because a restraining wor is really easy to get if a woman accuses a man of a level of abuse the notion tht she would not get a restraining order in the ella justice system is absurd mean though those orders are not hard to come by when t when it comes to when it comes to lost angelist jurist prudence she did not get it was actualy rejected you kno couldem burden o proof eu have to prove providing or to get a restrain or it is really really small the judge an actusi nat norestraining were at arbatis then the ale prosecutor's office which is looking to put famous people behind bars at this is how you make her name as a d in los angelis i man i one summered as a as a inturn over at the lost angelist district attorney major crimes divisions y no lot of people over there thet the the idea that people in that office i non in enoghlike if they could get a sleb dead to rights they would do it instead they dropped all charges in march twenty twenty two bower then filed the defimation lost ed against dedsmen and the athletic and a formr reporter for the athletic named molinight in that loss would you dropped the detail that the athletic had suggested not just suggested reported openly that this lady's skull had ben fractured when in fact they had medical evidente hat herscull had not been fracture they suggested that it might ave ben fractured and they already knew that by by technical data it was it had not ben fractured and all the rest a wethrt none of this stopped the m el b which is deatly afraid of controversy from them suspending him they injust extend is leave for the remainder of the entire season they ten went forward and end it up suspending him that lake the longest suspension in mal be history theyn a pining with a two season suspension this to be an april of twenty twenty two two season lake over o three hundred and forty two games then up being down greated laters a hundred ninety four games or something in a statement lead commissioner rob manfrits had than investigation conducted by the amelbe came to the conclusion that bower's conduct violated the policy and warranted suspension the domestic violence policy the mel be did not reveale these pecific conduct triggering the suspension ca if you are just t a casual watcher of this particular case and you had not paid attention to the fact noter straining or was granted an an paid attention to the fact tha the proscutors drop the case what you oud get because the amal be suspension is this gi robably is repeat sexual assaultor and possible rabis that that that is what you would have gotten from this and now bower place in gepan because gamplay in in the amell be because ofthe suspension in fact as it turns out he now has the receipt bower sued the lady she count er sud becaue this what you do andy get sued you very often counter soner to off set the damage isn' to get reverse discovery and all the rest and dum and it turns out that he now has the receipts and the receits are unbelievably damming of this woman's claims wl gets that momentarily first a

s pian former ellidoger's picture truver bower and the sand yago woman who first accused him of sexual assault triggering the investigation that led to an on precedent to suspension from emelbe have settled that civil loss suits outside of court with no money exchange between the parties the oman accuse bower of sexually assaulting her during two encounters in the spring of twenty twenty one prompting the former si yong la ward winter to be placed on administrative leave that chu li ho om as later denied a permanent restraining order in alley superior court the d s office to plain to fiul crimial charges we say but m l b which has the authority to apply punishment outside the criminal justice system and spoke to other women who made similar accusations then handed bower a three hundred twenty four game suspension in april twenty twenty two and independent arbifer shortened it to a hundred a ninety four games bower sued the women for defimation in april twenty twenty to women countersod for sexual battery four months later the woman apparently will receive three hundrd thousand dollars an insurance policy proceeds that would sent anhe trust accounts to her lawyer's office according to an email from hill's lawyers provided by representative with bower all the letegation ended up being settled the money actually andd changing hands now trever bower has now come forward with the actual receipt an this stuff is unbelievable to understand how unbelieve will the stuffage you first have to understand the nature of the alligations these are pictures then the woman reveal the te original accuser reveald one who just settled that she revealed to the prass these were unredacted photographs showing the alleged injuries saying that in in her lawyer said the damage could not possibly part of a consentual encounter andhe said look at this picture no one absolutely knowone can consent to this logically or legally temmer bawer seem continues to try to abuse in sall victim they need to stop now and shows her with black eyes ant shows her with a bruised face and ather sin this is why many people immediately jump to the conclusion that trever bawer was guilty because i mean un a logical level shorer who cansents to being punched in the face during during a sectual encounter whom launts that well now treverbower has come forward with tex messages that were found during discovery and vidio those sound during discovery and my goodness my goodness here here is hereis some of what trier bawer had to said next victim star picture for the dodgers a tax lensy hell send to a frend before she ever even met me what should i steal she asked another an reference to visiting my house for the first time the answer take his money how my that work i'm going to this house wednsday she said i already have my hooks in how i roll than after the first time we met that worth is fifty one mill she said you better secure the bag was the response but but how was she ong to do that need bady to choke me out she said being an absolute horrid of try to get in on is fifty one million read another tex that after the second time we met for podra's pictred jacob mix told her you got to get this bag i'll give you fifty thousand winsey replied her e a sponser aer at one point do you feel a tiny bit guilty not really she replied since that her legalty as approach me most blt times about coming to a financial settlement but as i have done since day one i refuse to par even a single sent in august of twenty twenty one when the hills claims were heard in court and during those legal proceedings critical information was deliberately and unlawfully concealed from me and my legaltine information this vidio which was taken by lendsey hill herself the morning after she clam she was brutally attacked an motionally tromatized an desperate to get away from me and now we have the meditator there can be no dispute it was taken mere minutes before she left my house on the morning of may sixteenth twenty twenty w to folks pos er in ther this for those who cannot see the actual tape this is her in bed the next morning turn her bot bouer sleeping on their sid the bed and there is nothing wrong tho race nothing she limp shofs viciously assaulted brutally assault ted she is taking if a vidio of herself smiling grinning in bed not a mark on er which would suggest that some time between when she left his house and then went to the hospital some one else did the damage to her that she then a mean therters nursays ho er saying that they never seen anybody who been pulverized in the general area the way that she was somebody puncton there the the vidio i mee and he is got to meditata they set now he can finally speak about all of this she could theoretically still sue him for a defamation if this were faulse there is no evidence that this is faulse i mean this is te take itt this is wild and means is wild he continues amay sixteenth twenty twenty one without my knowledge or consent of course in it he conseer lying in bad next three on sleeping smircin get the camra without a care ing the world or any marks on her face i thn you paints a pretty clear picture of what actually happened the evening ofma fifteenth and why the vidia was originally concealed from us after hearing the evidence available to her judged aan gold saultman found that linsey hill hav misled the court she found her claims to be materially misleaving i she denied her request for domestic vilence for straining worder and she found that no sexual assault or nonconsentual conduct took place now some of you might not know about restraining what her hearings i know i did not but i i've since learned that ta it is extremely rare for a request for a restraining wor her to be denied because the standard of proof that you need to obtain one is extremely well yray about that i vis o you can make about what you will the fact is i was never arrested i was never charged with t a crime and i won the only legal proceving that took place without my side of the story even bing heard and most importantly as at sid from ded one i never sexually assault of lendsy hill or any one else for that matter i soot her whech prompted erd at comrso me quite frankly regardless of the iucommin court i paind significantly more legalphes that wensey hill could ever in case he continues longhs lengs wit the evidence there is astonishing actual text befoore she went over to his house before she knew him saying that he is worth wat of money and she was going to go after him and there other accusations that have now been made against her about as one in june of this year in which an arizon al woman accordin to the assocsiy ind press accuse bower of sexual assault alleging n a loss who uptated this week he held a nife fo her throat in choke troud until she passed out during a rape theleftr pregnant but bow was never arrested er charged he is now counts orsuie denying the alligations accusing the woman of thaking the pregnancy in tprying to extort money from him in the first place the player's coagents sen to statement this woman is unhinged het said she made several million dollar demansagainst bower over two years prompting him to viola criminal complaint against her andapparently bower did fil wa criminal complaint in january alleging that the woman was trying to extort him again this hurin lies the problem with the entire meetion movement there is no such ting as believe all women when women make accusations this e'd actuallek completely degrades the actual reality of sexual assault and rape and if a woman goes after a man this way she should pay whatever penalty shoos attempting to get from criminally is what she should receive if shos a temp thing you get a ten year jail sentence for him for rape she should go o jo fortenurs because the this sort of tuf has to stop o behalf of great victims and of behalf of people are being falsely accused it is disgusting and is vile and its gross and the fact these still of headlines now the're treating trever bower as a disgraced person despite the fact that now this evidence has been revealed it is pretty damn telling it really really is now i'll get you sort of the interpersonal lessons here in just one moment first let us talk about living a healthy life style i'm on the rodalot means i'm not really getting as many fruits and vegetrables in normally would caus i got say the restauronts yer are unbelievable with that said the balance of nature fruits and vages that i relyon everyday are more and more important their great way to maksure getting essential nutricional ingrediens every single day through balance of nature's advance colld vackan process the vitemens minerals

or adisugar the only thing in ter capsuls is pure fruits and vegies balance of nature sent to bunch of ther product down to the studio fror my team to try everybody loves them producer's act brought his balance of nature ruit vegy capsils here to isually takes thome daily i've ben taking them as well their cotur i can head on over to balance of nature dot com use promacochul per forh thirty five percent off your first order as a preferred customer that is balance of nature dot com promo cot should pero for thirty five per cent off your first preferred order and again it is it is can be great for you it is can make a feel better go checke imoutring out bounce of natured ot com ang at thirty five percent off that first preferred order o caye ther're a few societal lessons to be learned here ivus the first is believe a womn is nonsense it is garbage o kat you can believe some women credible women who have actual evidence we shalall believe those people however this notion that in accusation is just ta convicion is ridiculous immoral and bad as tom or one number two this a lesson for you gentlemen stop having sex of granda women dont to it it is stupid this praticularly true if you have not be a prominent person with lot of money i know we should't have to say the sort of s up it this is the morality that our society has now created because here is the thing any society in which consent is the highest value is going to lead to the degradation of the sex act it just is i do not mean that consent is importan it is it is necessary but not sufficions because sufficient would be commitment sufficient would be love sufficient would be long turm relationship balwald be the stuff that is sufficient necessary is one component of sufficient but it is not the entiraty of course you ned consent datslik a baseline for anything but the problemman youcan have consent ats trever bower apparently did for all this according to a judge and it does not matter because it did not take place in the context of a committed relationship in any way and there is no way for trever bowdr protect himself against these sorts of accusacions when you throw away traditional morality and you substituted if i a a culture of consent and consent is incredibly malluable people can remove it post facto this one of things that we have now learned in american sit i f women regrets a thing happening to her if she consends to sexas just does not n the next morning that turns into a mee two story now if that is the way that wthat were gon to roll that means that the only real solution is go back to something that remotely resembles traditional morality we have a a peculiar society in which it is considered absolutely behavior beyond reproach should go to a man's house at three ofclock in the morning con sent to sex with him and the next morning diside he did not it that is considered absolutely morally meritorious whereis if you are might penc anyu sillizen here is the gel i'm not goingto meet with a woman alone who is not my wife in a room with a closed door that is considered very bad very very terrible very sexes in fact because how dare he he cannot have a both ways as not the way any this works but this the society that we have created becaue when you get beyond traditional morality in the sexual realm there is no rule system that actually can be followed that it is capable of hemming in people's behavior again committed relationships and sex within them is the best insurance against this sort of suffor both men and women but it something that we is ciety have completely discarded in the name of sexual hedanism and again consen it turns out it is not the whole balt ax tit is part of the ball of acident it is an important part ofthe ball lacts wit there needs to be more if if you wish to guaranty that this has not happened to you again reminder do not pick up people on tinder and screw them this is not again youare' nave b a bible believer to believe this all you have to believes in insense of structures and as particularly true if you are very rich ind very femos ir member a few years back henry cavill suggested that dating was really really difficult because again he is very very rich and he is very very famous and he suggested that he could not just go out grand on women or go home with grando women because what could happen next and he is right about that in in the name of caution famous men should definitely be very careful about this sort of behavior because the notion again that they are not womenwho are out there targating them is ridiculous this is a particular case in point as far as im ell be as far as other institutions there needs to be a standard that is set with regard to these institutions which is that unless there is a criminal conviction in these cases in accusation cannot be tann tomount to anding somebody is career it cannot be we have criminal proceedures for these sorts of things alligations can not remove hundreds of millions of dollarsfom a person's bottom line i hopetever bours is living halla tham all be over thus i really hope it does because truthly this cannot be the standard oure con social media to this ran now to rustle bran maybe alligations are true if they are true the police are on it in britton they are looking for women to testify they are looking for women to come forward with actual evidence if it turns out to be true rstell should go to jail but if it is not the fact that you to bes demonitizing him over allegations alone how exactly what sort of standard is that' that harryspost to rebut any of that the answers you cannot that is exactly the standard that the far left would on these istues is that an accusation can destroy anybody's career ellisnt i'm lucky i'm an orthodox chu i've ee married since the time i was twenty thre n have yours old nows virgin and oll my marriage i'm i'm not vulnerable to the sorts of charges but that is the whole problem any one can be vulnerable to thes sorts of charges he is all it takes is an accusation it does not have to be real it does not have to be substantiated nothing and that is scary is all living hell and should be to men and women and it should also by the way be deeply insulting to wome who have actualy been sexually assaulted in secually harm by men o ke meanwhile donald trump is showing up in cort y shod up in court yesterday in manhagats that momentarily first reave a lot on our scattuals especually as parents right now socker practic science fairs prepping four o the holidays goodness is he a a big thing offyour plate hou put great meat onyour plate with good ranchers now again good ranchers makes amazing amazing cuts of stake they really do i man they got me a cotre stick one time in credible stake hyou care abou what you'r family eats sodos good ranchers that is wy they spent years building relationships of local farms to sorce thebust one hundred per cent

delivered o case donald trump yesterday went to cort in manhattan according to th e your times he deed toward from the campaign trail on monday to attend the opening of the civil trial in the ew yorca turny generals fraud case against him as his political teamet seeks to turn the spectacle in to a rallyan cry for supporters now trump has not been in the headlines for atleast a couple of leagues about his legal trevails every time he is it boosts him in the ratings which presumably is why he showed up in manhanian aftershob in manhattan again this is the bazar politics o the moment trumpwright now is trying to head off at the pass any possible consolidation of the rest of the twenty twenty four field his team his are to come oun sad that they wone niks any possible future debates inside their publican party even hough he is not taking place cause he does't want any attention on any other candidate also he is now showing up in cord tas a campaign ploy now two things as always can be tro ones one donald trump is being absolutely railroaded in this near case he really is no one was damaged no one was damage in new york the lenders are not suing him the people who did business with him are ot suing him the state of new york is not even alleging that they have losses because of him instead the state f new york is alleging that he engaged n a pattern of fraudulant behavior that damage no one and there is and they are grabbing his business is new york and taking control of them to the tone of two hundred fifty million dollars in liability baste on no damages which is crazy again if let us say that you and i going to a mortgage arrangement and i say to you listen i say my houses wer twice what t's worh an you kindin know that is true but you also know that i'm good for my dat and you also now that its good be in business with me see give me alone now you are not damaged i'm not damage is that bad behate sure it is that is that frautulan behavior i mean according to low new york i' be frautulan behavior is tat something thi stake can punish who is the victim how many crimes does the state punish thet are there truly victim less in the sense that everybody involved those exactly what is going on and it is a regular part of the business and if it is that thet they go after people it cannot be that they only goeftor trump for this show me some precedent of how often this lawt is used in the absence of any damages even a ledge but that that is all true the other thing that istrus the donals frum his using this for political purposes every time he goes to court he knows that the american public at least on the right side of the isle rallyes to his defense because we all see that ito be ask and the way that the right ralliyest his defence is not by contributing to his legal fund instead the way that the right right rallies to is defenceis by saying he should be the nominy which you get is a very weird form of rallying to his defense as i can believe two things one that he is being railroaded and too this does not make him stronger as a candidate against torbide becaus my chief priority is not using my vote as as some sort of loyalty pledge tan onal trump myche firard he is using my votes to d efeet jobidens when i'm looking at is who is most likely to beat bidon a drum and that invalves making bidin the issue because bidon is the issue bidon is not even alive he has terrible policies he will talk abouts of the fall out from some those policies and moment if we are time out tronals frumps legal issues or not talking about as i've sat a thousand times jobid in any case trum showed up hi's un eric also shut up he was join by several of his political aids including wall mouta his cot dofended in the federal case accusing him of mishandling classified at documents here is it donal trump talking about that taught i men he he says the clapar aloud that then geff love bout trump is that heis absolute transparent in every way here o us saing the quapart out loud that that he is basially there for the bolls and i do not thin a pee mo u tis tirin i going tis stand ork if i worn leating in all the palls or if i worit runing i would hav any i tese case is i woul be seen you this morning ut i'll beten a lot of new be gusnis is a horrile thing ti tappenin to or tin try and wen gotin in in stratin to way wel no in i se o ro gi in me listit to this man and i tin most people gan peopey getting it i in tiin the bonis gettin in ecas every time the giv me a takin di in i go up in the balls an thats never happen be yorks ut this is is dissgrace and you go avin tis an turnin genero ecause he is turning off everybody from coming in you kno in o is tak o le in the outlow business usnis is or plin new york he is right out all this by the way and it is also true that he is am that he is correct about the fact that if he were not re publican candidate again theywoud hve left im aloomy he all these real estate yeals at their accusing him of false fine if he is been a real estat magnate in new york since he was doing mose an lacollic culkin amin th thi thist is a amcerdainty and then trump continues he says this seu just a continuation of the greatest witch hunt again not wrong this is a e o ei o see o a is wi a o o e o e o i o we e any ac on on n on tiny a on eta a a is to tery en oo o wraon a is ti o e gan t e weni wnoani thin obout e use this to en e go o ee o one o a eo i o o she cam back an i o n oo bac a gan trup again and this is wan we a i can i i shan ye again all very true all that is true it is also true that democrats oure itching to talk about the stuff literally all the time it is what they wish to talk about all the time and donald trump talking about it is not particularly benoficial to republicans in general and this is this the big robhim here it also happens to be then other legal cases things are probablygan yet worse for trump not better according to sianan the fultan county district atorney's offices now issue disopena to former new york police commissioner burniy kerrick to testify in the first tro later this month in the case stemming from elections to version plots in georgia according to his lawyer caric's lawyer is demanding tht his clime be granted immunity and exchange for testifying pointing out the prosecutors indited indicated in theinnictment that karick was a coconspurator in the case he is not named in theindentment but he is considerd co conspirator number five basically the idea here is that caric ould be granted immunity in return for a testifying against donald trump is one to big primise the trump has a and this why the rego case in george is dangerous for trump is when you rap in a bunch of other people surrounding trump and then one having to be paying their legal bills than the temptation is goin to be to cut a deal with the fulton count o prosecutors get immunity and then testify against trump his leaving aside the document's case in florta all these legal issues are going to stack up against trump and trump championing them in the primaries to elevate him to the nomination if if he thinks yo can be able o turn off that spiget not talk about the stuff in the general that is wrong an this is going to be a chief issue in the general election andit may be the only thing i can say biten because biding is struggling out there and that this it o between this and and trump continuing to to yo do what he can to alien ate burban women i does yeu have a path against byshuryis paf agains bide me is bidon is deeply unpopular he'r a lot of people might not show up for bide meas they just do not jobine very much and becaue a lot people know we all known our bones he is not going to surv out a second tarm and comell heris will be precedent if jobidon is reelected all that may be true butit seems to me that if you can bat on a horse that is not week then that now be better it seems to me that if youare going to bet on a candidate you do not want a bat that the other gitos con a fall down on the job yourn a bat on somebody who can beat him when he is at his strongest and right now i'm not sure that that is what republicans are doing el over the week en for example donald trump spent the week en a droping lines mocking pall polosy nancy polocy's husband at the california giope madin no his a ain tos have to gest laughs inside a room e s joking but also is it the kind of stuff that is going to drive intopendence and as sor rimen women back into his camy i i do not see how together we will ta on the ute leftwing lirs lose cre perversan fre or debowrin the a te ta i on up lu a will stand up te crazy tany plosy won san francisco how is yeur husband goin bethe b a cheasy get building h walin up adereen thosy as e wal around our house which obviously din doaver good yob mn i do not now poppulotest to with anything that that sort stuff gets played n ads and the entire biding case is going to be the donnels from as int a farrious character that iscon be the entirer case for his reolect nothng about your bidin nothing at higs god president nothing that is all it is going to be and and the fact that that that trump it is he cannot make an affirmative case that actually draws people back to him perseling and he people leveen lov im en out word about those people worry about people who do not love him are they going to turn out in boat for him or the very least stay home and not vote for bidin an that that is a risky play now is it possible that that could work out form sure because again jobidneits a terrible president will get to that in just one second the medical establishment has been disregarding the lives of innocent kids for decades it now many

master selling over two hundred ninety five million evented tickets in the first six months of twenty twenty three that sup nearly eighteen per cent yer over year why is this happening while one o the

speak of some one who is pay off my own debts my wife debts and many other debts this is something you should do i know that we now considered this not a matter of moral of moral quandry but actually when you take out alone you owe somebody the money i'm i'm just absolutely confused by this idea that when i take out a student lon i o o the money that the somebody else ons m in andicate now the

saying tha tying the president to te economy may be wess t'n the test i dea wen somany amaricans do not fee they have got in a had and many of them are now saying they feel better with republican an

where we are right now again we have realway ganes over the pat to month tit con tithently supports strong contumerspenting which is leaving to a gity any mor for themthey are just dumb they are just dumb i mean the fact that that they keep saying overnover the by nomics is a good idea and good branding they are not good at this this is what donal trump is rlying on as them being really bad of tis again the the great agreement between the two parties of the selections tycle as there is no way we can loose it act a ton't cous that tere's noway we can lose to trumpan repungans there is no way we can loose the jobitmal will somebody don to be wrong but jobin's possies continued fail when it comes to you crane they they keep wondering why it is that american supwhart is bleeding away from you crane they are bunch of reasons the number on reason is there is no offeramp here eu as it presented no offrambutyou have suggested you will not present an offram whell you gets have suggested the bid an administration is as long as it takes with as mucti s it takes and you will not demand any sort of enpoint yout you have no clue what winning even looks and turns out theamerican peol are not up for that you not else there not up for hey're not up for pouring tons of money into the corruption rathole of the ou cranian government it is one thing to pay for weaponry to repel a russian invasion it is one thing to give them old weaponry to take out russian troops to great russian military capacity and prevent rut china strongest ally from becoming stronger it is worth it to tot swade china from invading tilan by pointing out that there will be reprecussions for doing however when americans are not up for it it spending buillions of dollare rebuilding you crani an economy when that is a really corrupt place in letis plent this out in the united states shere is a laws ale the formcrup practiceis act if i go down to panama and i decide i want to bild a hotel and any demands a bribe for me to bild that hotel and i pay that bribe i will be prosecuted in the united states to america for having done that even ifim bringing jobs and economic growth to panama if however i am the federal goverment of the united states ni to side to por buillions of dollars into a corruption rathole in you crane then apparently that is totally vine if you do it on a personal level then you will go to jail if you do it is the federal government then not only s to find it is praiseworthy well now there is a leat communication from the by n administration talking about crruption in you crane whichas ben a longstanding prom over there quote bidin administration officials politico are far more worried about corruption an you crane than they publicly admit a confidential you a stratagy document obtain n by political suggests the sensitive but un classified version of the long term gust plan they's ow numerous steps washington is taking to help key but roud out malfeasans and otherwise reforming a ray of you craniansectors it stresses thet corruption could cause lestern owlies to abandon you cranes fight against russia's invasion and that key that cannot put off the antigraft effort perceptions of high level corruption the confidential version of the document says could under min the ucranian publics and form leader's confidence in the wor time government they confidential version is about three times as long as the non confidential version the administration wants to presso crane's cutgraph not least because it yest dollars are at stake they say there is some honest conversations happening behind the scenes but again this they are a lot of complaints over here about why as you crane not beeg more forthcoming about about firing people for graft apparently he has fired several top dofence officials in a recent crack down on its supposed graft we will see if that is true or not and what what this does speak to is the fact that there is no long from stratic stragy in ucrane the public part of the traghe says d ol garcazation particularly the energy in miningsectores the quartenent to building back abotter ou crane one indicator of success the confidential merciant states is the ucranian government embraces meaningful reforms the centralizing control of the energy secor wit can i i can i think of a ucranian energy sector business that was being investigated for corruption and that was being presided over by a vice president whose crnly brisma brasma oya came to mind turns out corruption ou crane really bad you knw whoas deeply involves in crruptionu crane hunter bite you knw whos dat was joe jo was doing h's v p at the time and whos presiding over you crane policy all this is a little awkward pwenting out corruption ou crane does not just mean that support for the ucrane war goes down it also means pointing out that jobidnson was involved deeply in it failure on that front failure on the conomic front failure on e e crane war front and also failure on the border front calfy hocal governor of new york even she is out there now admitting pretty publicly tha the borer is wide open well we want them to to have the limit om who can come across the border it is two open right now o people coming from all over the world are finding their way through simply thing may meed a thylum and the majority of them seem beanding up an the strenth that new york and that is the real croblem for new york city one hundred and twenty five thousand newly arrived an vatils i mean when even the governr of new york is calling you out that sa serious problem for the about administration meanwhile crime continues to spiral out of control in americas major cities ind washington b s henry quayar who is a democratic congress person from texas was carjact to day in philadelphia which is dominated by left wing d a lary cramer a journalist an josh cruger was shot seven times in his home in south philadelphia no rest had ben made no weapon was found he had recently written articles for wide variety of sources an dum and apparently in writingabout that he talked about how the city of philadelphia was not being too easy on criminality it is its terrible and its awful in this hi's what happens when a city is too easy on criminality meanwhile on the federal front obomicar has been a gian fail jobidens chief achievement as vice president of th united states the big fing deologo byan tok fat has ben a complete failure good pca by makin mac cartel over the washington post titled obomicar has been unable to save tu money on u us helf gare quote given the high cost of th ushelfcar system ints natural to assume there must be some easy way to make sizable cut after all in twenty twenty two the uas spent sixteen point six per cent of g t p on helf gare the next highest spender germany spent twelve point seven per cent as the affordable caract took shape almost fifteen years ago it is architect started looking for savings in earnest all these years later we still havin't found the magic money p ot this is notbecause people are not trying a bmomicar contain a lot of elements that wer expected to realize significant cost savings preventive care it was hoped could catch conditions early an forestall emergency expensive iexpensive emergency rom visits doctors and hospitals cun be paid to keep patients healthy rather than form expensive preceedures there be a government board thet could rigorously assess treatments fore cost effectiveness but instad the savings just ive not materialized at all infact thes called c m m i the sentr for medicar and medicate invation would run which was supposed to run pilot projects to reduce costs instead and it a costing government five point for billion dollars expected to cost another one pointh rebillion dollars by twenty thirty prevent them cost turn out to cost more than its ade because doctors may need to treat a lot of miner conditions to prevent one majur serious health crisis expanding the number of insurns of insured turns out to make emergency room visits rise not fall because newly insure people do not worry about the cost it increase his demand just youud imagine if you look at any supply deman curve there are ways to save money but thers to make people wait longer for tasts of treatment again as i've said for years and years for decate there is three elements of healthcare there is a fortability there is unifersality and there is quality and you can only have to other three cannot have althory that n in braght now the lie that abomcars can provide all three it was indeed eli busically everything democrats ofe touched on polsy has turned to craft the democrats are rele vulnerable meanwhile re publicans again finding ways to pull the feet from the jaws of victory really is kind of an amazing thing in the twenty twenty to election cycles all about re publicans having all the momentsmen some how blowing all of it by nominating head cases that er's a genious move well now democrats are blowing themselves up in congress gemal boman is making a fool of himself on every possible angle is the guy who decided to pull a fire alarm the other day in order forestall a vote on the continuing resolution then pretend that he thought the firelon as can open the door as the babylon be joked an next he is a goingto pull a firearm thinkn that hes flushing his yearnal an understand how that that works here is covernor cathe going after gmall boman what is really interesting this is a former principle he knows what a fire alar ter this is a mar that has gotot and yell that members and iit has behave or it has been ute e com but what is interesting if it really wats just an accident when the capital plece came to entervy you why would you lawyer up right away ter why why would not ris tat all ly guysi mad o wit stake here why would you let it go on her gemal boman has now made another bouboa gan congressajus filled with clowns it is a clown show over there is basically a clown car the only question is how he can fit many clowns in the small space but gemal boman his people are now suggesting that im republicans are noties for asking about a quote i believe congressmen bowmen when he says this was an accident is this suggested response from bowman's office to questions about the incident republicans need to instead folkess their energy on the noxy nembers of their party before anything else that is what gemal bomans press secretary sent to all howse democratic offices genius is happening her min these people are absolute geniusis gemalboman then had toe issue a tweet to crying his own office bot i just become aware than our message in guidans tere is in appropriate use of the termnaty without my consent i candemn the use of the termnazi out of its precise definition it is important to specify the termnaza first members of the noty party and neonaties man that vacki he is he is good at is he is just these these left wingers there such geniuses theire amazing at this robably republican should have a fight over the speakership i think tht would be beneficial a tdis point when i say that i being as cynical as it is possible to be yesterday madgates who has been ripping on mac carthy for quit a while tok to the floor to formerly move ahead with a vote to alsmac carthy as speaker known as a motion to macate he here he was yesterday explaining that he was going to a issue a motion vacate let me gat the strat to extend joe bidon spending and joe bidon's policy priorities the speaker of the house jave away to joe bidon the money for you crane that joe bidon want it is going to be difficult for my republican friends to keep calling president bidan feeble whall he continues to take speaker ma carthy's lunch money in every negotiation it is just and because of this because of maccarthy's supposed failings in not prying more saving spendings out of out of gobidon hesshould have his speakership challenges is going maccates there is ony one promatcate acted to scuttle a betters he are two weeks ago thit is better scowerdf involved in eight per cent discretionary cut in spending and wout ave ivo borst security provisions and said he scttled that unti last minute mac carthy cut a deal in which there is a clean see our absent you crane funding what exact what is the point of this on evnen understand what what ae you what you seeking to achieve who is going to replace him see how the usual cast of caracters andibigs frm arizona saying that he cannot remain speaker and all the rester they have no one else in the wings waiting to do anything the're over two hundred republicans in the house whalready do not support gettng rid ma carthing this just can be another humiliating vote take over and over and over if it actually gets past the motions to table which is going to be issued i assumed to stop gates is motion to suspend no bob good i he he was asked about mac carthea speaker the representative from virginia who is allied with a with gates very often and he just kept dotching the question what your thoughts are are you going to support matgates os effort to remove by carthea speaker could that play out this week well i win'l just say that he what we saw happen yesterday wass a rehe a pass failurs by republican leadership and frankly that is what januwhere was about what i most foke about that conjanywhere going to speaker contest is that we could not do what we dine the last ten fiftin your republicans had majarity which was to pass maj your spending dell bills with ae predominant majarty o democrat but and that is what happened yesterday you want am ow well i was constart about him as figure as at's well record all that dor janou wary because of the fail yo past this is a repeat of those failures i guess weare butt i guess i guesst yous iave made up your mind yet or e what what iit isbetter critic o covernor carthu for some time now why not say you are liking arms with backates and you are rigty to oustoma speaker what is is it about personalities indivisuals this is about doing whats righte by the country an gat no answer there because there is no plan there is no plan running headlong into walls is not a plans again whichever party stopped being moronic and insane first is going to win the next selection or maybe no one's gentlemen everk as that all then be insant endmeronic that is that is just on continue to be also a time for some things i in thn some things that i hate things at that i today again i am over here in israel people very often ask me for you knw whell you'r israel what is good israel book excellent book by gin im a rick richman calle thit none shall make them afraid it' slip biographies of eight people whofv been involved in the modern state of israel they range from theatre hurtsil to clind whitesmen the first president of the state of israel to men ow com bagan it is it is really good that thse are really interesting byograves you will learn things she did not know about all of these people even if you happen to be familiar with some ofthe history if you do not know the history is a really good sort of way to examine is rally history and what is been happening over here again work the read and none shll make them afraid i a time for a thing that i hate why do people care about tailor swift an travis celsy an man i just do not understand this is eating up my twitterfeet every instrgrandposts about tailor swift an and travis celsy and i do not understand why i'm supposed to care i do not i mean tailor swift is famous for literally writing a song about how she has a giant list of men that she has dated this is another person onolist tof men that she is dating and the'e oit con i no married i man i hate to break it to you they are not going to and if i'm wrong ok ey then i will send them a wecap bake boucaflowers of the wedding but far she sdated a thousand men and she is married none of them and the reason for that is because the prospect of single free and clear tailor dating men is very lucrative you knowit happens when she gets married she loses money an aure insensive laden society has i basically decided that women who settled down and have a happy marriage are less valuable at least when it comes to pop culture than women who data lot and maybe that is because there is the alure of well she is it maybe she will date you next she is not in a date you brow not can t happen what do you care and as far as the sort of whill she is with a football player and it is the all american couple it is it is a singher and a football player and wow are not first of all the fact that the anofellows falling for this its cone to be superfun when she dumps him and then she turns out to be u a basketbalphand or something that is goin t that is can be mazesin but also the fact that we are all suppose to pin are hopes for the romantic future on on tailor swift and travis celsy seems perverse to mae ow no why in the world any one would would warmd their idea of romance a round tailor swift who again is dayed evern frm lie jag jillan haul to john mayor two the ate remember back street boys some members about i ironoat the story is in any case entire piece in the washington posted a tailor swift to traves kelsy and a

what should we call them that paragraph was a test surely you understander provided your part of the human population but for those of you who forever reason arn't tailor swift showed up at a football

romance we ell need if feels it gets right for america i'll get first of all i'm scon a point out that tailor swift faking enthusiasm for things is part of her bran an if you watch the emty the viddinga musical words any of it theyre playing fom the crappies music magn bl and chooses smiling and dancing along she actually cared do i actually thank that this is a thing an i underst i hope

freeing thing tailor swift has done in twenty years im that is just as il get call me when they get married call i hen hey get married these an tailor swift faking enthusia i find her completely an

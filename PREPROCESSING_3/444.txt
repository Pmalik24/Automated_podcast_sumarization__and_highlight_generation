welcome to the huberman laponen af science science pace to i man druhubermen and on a professor of neurbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine today we are going to talk about the biology psychology and utility of play play is something that normally we associate with children's games and indeed with being a child much of our childhood development centers around play whether not its organized play or spontaneous play but as adults we also need to play and to day i'm going to talk about when i to refer to as the power of play the power of play resides in plays ability to change our nervous system for the better that we can perform many activities not just play activities better play can also function as a way to explore new ways of being in different conareos in work in relationships in settings of all kind and indeed also in the relationship to oneself in fact we are going to explore hou assuming different identities juring the same game of play er the same forms of play has been shown to be immensely powerful for allowing people to engage in more creative thinking and dynamic thinking and indeed to become better leaders and more effective workers and students and learners and happier people am also going to cover some data that shows that learning to play properly can enhance one's ability to focus and is an active ary of research for treatment of things h d h t attention defisite hyper activity disorder just as a little sneak preview of where that is headed childreng who do not access enough play during certain stages of childhood are more prone to develop ad ht the good news is all of us regardless of whether not we have a d ht or not whether not we had ample access to play during childhood or not can engage and grow the nerl circuits that allow for this incredible power of play this can be done again at any stage of life today worego to talk about the protocalls the science we review all of that and i promise you will come away with a lot of knowledge whether not your apparent whether not your child whether nt your person of any age you are going to have tools and knowledge that will benefit you before we begin i want to share with you the results of what i think to be an extremely exciting and certainly an actionable study that was just published in the journal scientific reports this is an excellent journal nature pressjournal pure reviewed et cetera and the finding centere around what sorts of devices we happen to be reading on an accessing information on and how that is impacting our physiology and our capacity to learn one of the more frequent questions i get is what are all these devices phones tablets computers vidiogames et cetera doing to our brains and finally there some good pure reviewed data to look at that and to address it directly this study first author honma h o an m a honma at all is entitle reading on a smart phone affects sigh generation that is assigeh si generation brain activity and comprehension and to just sumorise what they founde they ran a study on thirty phor healthy individuals and had them either read material on a smart phone or on regular printed paper or a book and what they found is that comprehension on devices in particular smartphones is much poorer much worse than it is when one reads on actual paper some of you may experience this yourselves now they compared smartphones with paper and what they found was that when they looked at people's breathing the normal patterns of breathing that people were engaging in did not differ between people reading on a smart phone or reading from paper however one particular feature of breathing did differ and that particular feature is what we call physiological size i've talked a lot about physiological size on this podcast and on sociomedia we had a terrific guest professor jack feldman from university california lost angelis is a world expert in breathing an respiration and its impacts on the brain and how brain controls breathing and respiration and what you can learn from that episode or i'll just tell you again right now is that every five minutes or whether not we are a sleep or awake we do what is called a physiological size which is a big deep inhale often a double inhale followed by a long exhale and go something this now you might think oh i never breathe that but you do unless there something severely wrong with your brainstem every five minutes or you do one of these physiological size which reopens all the little hundreds of millions of saxon your lungs calld they eviola that bring in more oxygen as a consequence of that big deep double inhale and then you are able to exhale carbonioxide offloat carbonoxide through that long exhale i've also encouraged people to use the physiological size deliberately not just spontaneously as a way to reduce their stress quickly and indeed my lap works on physiological size and has been exploring this and thei're quite effective in reducing our stress very fast reading on a smart phone seems to suppress physiological sign people ren't aware that it is happening but its happening some people have talked about caled emale apnia which is the fact that people hold their breath while while they emale or while they texon indeed many people do that this is distinct from emale or texting appenia what is happening here is people are reading on the phone and for whatever reason andi'l talk about what the likely reason is but for whatever reason theire suppressing their sighing and as a consequence the brain is not getting enough oxygen and is not offloading enough carbondoxide and another finding in the study was that the prefrontal quartexon area of the brain that is involved in pocus and attention and learning becomes hyperactive in a kind of desperate attempt to focus all of this can be sunrise by saying if you happen to read on a device whether not its a tablet standard computer screen of any kind but in particular on a smart phone regardless of how small or large that smart phone screen is you want to remind yourself to engage in these physiological size fairly regularly and it might hy may be better to just wed the most store at least the ky issues are in thingsthat your crhina learn about the ke information from paper either books or printed out material of some other sort what is the underlying mechanism here well one o ther reasons i tho study much is that it brings together two of my laboratories and my particular interests in nour ascience which is how does our visual system and the aperture meaning the size of our visual window relate to our called autonomic pfunction or our internal state basically what is happening here is as any of us bring our visual window in more narrowly as we contract our visual window which is exactly what happens when wer looking it al smart phone in front of us it seems to suppress the breathing apparatus because we know that physiological size are controlled by a specific set of nurons in the brainstem calle the parifacial neuclis discovered by doctor jackphildman and there must be a mechanism whereby when we tighten our visual window we somehow we do not know yet how this happens but somehow suppress the activity f these nurons in the parifacial nuclius that generate is physiological size again you have two choices or i suppose you have many choices but two main choices to contend with this new information one is that you remind yourself to engage in deep breathing and in particular physiological size every five minutes or while reading anything or texting on your smart phone the other would be again if there is material that you really need to learn forsake of regrigitation later or for you something particularly important try ind read that from either a larger screen or even better would be from printed materials or books another reason i bring all that up is that it relates to a larger theme which is that i get many many questions about gdit an about people's challenges with focus and much of what weare told these days is that we are challenge with focus because of the hundreds of vidios that we can see streaming by us at any moment on our phone which probably is true the fact that the information that were reading on the internetend on our phones is emotionally disturbing our distressing in some way and that probably is true as well in many cases this study really points to the fact that independent of the information that we are looking at or consuming independent whether not its movies or texts or anything of that sort the mere size of the window the aperture the screen that we are looking at is also strongly impacting our ability to learn and remember information broad in that visual window printhings ou look at a book i did not desin the system i wa say however our visual system ind respiratory system a happend to ofolve i was not consulted e design phase this suggustimply how youre brain circuits work if you want to learn things wide in that visual window and even better printhings out pick up a book or read on a tablet even but try iang make that tablet larger than a smart phone screen size before we begin our discussion about the power of play i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching ind research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero costo consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at letic greens is an all in one vitemen mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reasen i started taking athletic greens an th reason i still take athletigrens once or twice o day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutricional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which our vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called gop microbiom and the ways in which the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without letic greens i get the vitemens i need the minerals i need end the probiocs to support my microbiom if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic greenstock com slash hubermen and claim a special offer they'l give you fiv free

on this podcast about the key roll of hydration end electrolytes for nerve sell function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues ind organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium in potassium present in the proparatios all of those cells function properly nd all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is

huberman let us talk about play nw in researching this episode i thought that i was going to come across a bunch of papers that say this brain area connect to that brain area which controls play in animals and their similar areas an babies and an adults and indeed that is true and we will talk about brain circuitry but i think more importantly as to understand what is the utility of play aw why do we play when we are younger why do we tend to play less as we get older and what in the world is play for some of us would be categorized as more playful i'm sure that people this maybe you are this people that can walk into a room a social setting of any kind and they seem to already cive have a a playful made even of mischievous quality about them will talk about mischief alobat lator but the sove look at and environmen to ou social setting as an opportunity for different kinds of novel interactions other people and i probld but myself into this category if i walk into a novel environment i tend to be more in the mode of ofe just ascessing what that environment is i am not a particularly spontaneously playful person although round certain individuals i might be more spontaneously playful we are all on a continuum of this can of seriousness to playful nature turns out that all young animals including humans have more playfulness and tend to engage in more spontaneous play in their earlier years than in their later years and therein lies a very interesting portal to understanding what the utility what the purpos of play is first of all i want to lay down a couple of key facts about play that point to the fact that play is not just about games play is about much much more and play and in particular how we played as a child and still how we can play as adults is really how we test and expand our protential rolls in all kinds of interactions one of the most important interesting and surprising features of play that i'd every one to know about is that it is homeostatically regulated some of you are familiar with the termhomeostasis homeostasis is just this aspect of biological systems to try and remain in balance and if you stay a wake for a long period of time you tend to want to sleep for a long period of time if you slept for a long period of time and your very rested than you tend to be very energetic the next day and of course i know people out there will immediately say oh well if i sleep too long then umgrogu the next day of course they are exceptions but in general sleep and wakefulness are in homeostatic balance thirst and water consumption are in homeostatic balance if you do not drink any fluids for while you tend to get more thirsty you drink fluids and your thirst tends to diminish likewise with food likewise with most all motivated behaviors well one of the most important discoveries of the last century was largely the work of a guidname yach panks ep know it is not jack ets yach pangsep who really pioneers this understanding of the biology of play and relating that to the psychologiof play in animals in humans he is considered a kind of luminary in the field of play n what a great title to have right if you could have a title and be a scientific luminary u might as well be the the plaggoin in fact he was known and i'll get into this later as to ibut who was known as the rat tickler a because he tickled rats and e actually found that rodins and animals of many kind generate laughter and response to tickling and in fact they do not have the capacity tickle themselves something also talk about why that is and he was called the rat tickler but then he discovered that many species of animals engage in laughter and response to tickling that they tickle each other and the reason you do not hear them laughing kno you cannot hear your dog laughing that is not laughing it something else is that most animals besides humans laugh at kind of ultrosonic levels of of auditory output meaning the frequencies of sound are just too high for you to hear but with the appropriate devisis he was able with his colleagues to isolate the called a the rat laughter and then turns out there is kitten laughter and there is puppy laughter and of course there is human laughter yach pangs up was a very interesting and pioneering person in this field and he also discovered that play is homiostatically regulated meaning if animals including children are restricted from playing for a certain amount of time they will play more when given the opportunity in the same way that if i food restrict you for a long perid of time you will eat more when you are finally allowed to eat and this is important because it moves this thing that we call play from the dimension of higher order functions or things that evolved recently a that are really kind of it the frunt edge of human evolution deeper into the circuitry of the brain whereby we say the brain stem the kind of ancient parts of the brain are going to be involved and in fact thacts the case as we are going to learn later in the podcast play is generated through the conictivity of many brain areas but one of the key brain areas is an area called p a g perry aqueductal grat the periaqueductal grays it brainstemarea it is pretty far back as the brain conto transitions into the sponal court and it is rich with nurons that make indogenis opioids these are not the kinds of opioids that are causing thet opioid crisis these are nurons that you and i all have that release in dogenists meaning self made or biologically made opioids they go by names in keflin and things of that sort play evokes small amounts of opoid release into the system they kind of dopyou up a little bit not much a as one would see if one were to take exogenis opioits in fact exogenis opioids as we now know are potentially very hazardous highly hyodiction potential hi overdose potential they cause all sorts of probles yes there are clinical uses for them but their causing a lot of problemce now adays but tese indogenous opioids are rel east in children an adults any time we engage in play and that turns out to be a very important chemical state because there is something about having an abundance of these indoginous opioids released into the brain that allows other airs of the brain the prefrontal quartex the area of the front that is responsible for what we call executive function executive function is the ability to make predictions to access contingencies if i do this than that happens if i do that than that happens what prefront ol quartexes often seen as a kind of rigid executive of the whole brain that is one way to view it but probably a better way to view it is that the prefront a quartex works in concert with these other more primitive circuitries and when the pariaqueducta gray releases these indogeonius opoids during play the prefront al quartex does not get stupid it actually get smartar it develops the ability to take on different rolls and explore different contingencies and we are gin a talk about rol play later in different contects and what we l find is that much of play is really about exploring things in a way that feel safe enough to explore right this is not what happens when we drive down the street or when we bike down the street when we are aheaded to work commuting on our bicycle or walking or driving we tend to be very linear and we have ten to be very goll directed we are not gan it just take a new street just because we are not con be spontaneously a riding in the mill the road and then on the sidewalk in them bact and forth although i can remember as a kid i was doing some th elect to jump off curb cuts when i was a kid and then eventualy i graduated sorry tor the cyclists but i graduated to scape wording and then i let on escape boarding youre always kind of exploring terrain wenow as i got older actsha i find myself becoming much more lineor i just do not play with my commute very much it is rely jous about getting to work and than working when indogenous opioids are in our system when we are in this mode of play the prefrnt ol quartect starts seen and exploring many more possibilities of how we interact with our environment with others and the rolls that we can assume for ourselves and we are going to dissect one by one the different aspects of play roll play social play individual play imaginary play competitive play their enormous number of dimensions of play and by the end of this episode we are going to arrive at a very key feature the key feature is one that is called your personal play identity all of us have what we call a personal play identity this personal play identity was laid down during development and it is the identity that you assume in playful ccenarios and it is the identity that you adopt in non playful cenareos the great news is that your personal play identity is plastic throughout your entire life span you can adjust your personal play identity in ways that will benefit you in work in relationships and youre over all level of happiness we will discuss protocalls and ways to do that but i do ant to give a nod to the lat jach yach excuse me a yach pangsep a the rat ticcler an and i also when a just given nod to play generally as we move forward in the discussion what i' love for everyone to do is to stop thinking about play as just a child activity not just a sport related activity but really as an exploration in contingencies again it is an exploration of if i do a what happens if i do be what happens if some one else takes on behavior or a attitude see what am i going to do and play is really where we can expand our catalogue of potential outcomes and it can be enormously enriching and indeed as we will talk about the tinkerers of the world the true creatives the people that build incredible technology is and art and also they just have incredibly rich emotional and intellectual and social lives all have a strong element of play and to day i hope to convince you of some protocals that wil allow you to expand your various rolls in life through the portal of play we establish that play is homeostatic meaning we all need to do it many of us including myself i heaven play that much as adults ar pretty busy number of us are stressed we got lut to do in life but as children most all of us ingaging a lot of play and in looking at the way that very young children and especially toddler's play we can learn a lot because it reveals the fundamental rules by which the toddler brain interacts with the world now one of the keythings about the baby brain is that the baby brain somehow knows that it cannot do everything in the world right if a baby meed something it generally will cry or make some sort of vocalization or some sort of facial expression or commonation of those and the caretaker whoever that may be will provide it this is an ancient hard wired mechanism whereby the called autonomic nervous system that generate stress will create this kind of whining and discomfort maybe a writhing maybe the babe gets con o red in the face and the caretaker delivers some thing based on a good guess of what that baby needs maybe it is brestmilk maybe it is bottle milk maybe it is a diper change maybe it is to be warmed up if the baby is cold mayb it is to be cool down if the babies to warm maybe if the babies in its little wonesy thing it is feeling restricted and just wants to move in thi get taken out of their their craber the stroller whatever it is and allowed to stretch out on the floor remember the baby does not know exactly what it needs it only knows the state of discomfort and of course we do not know exactly what babies and toddlers are thinking because they cannot express themselves with language yet but what is key to understand is the rule or the contingency that is set up in that scenario and that sonario the child it feals some discomfort epresses that discomfort verbally or through offacial expression or both and then some force some person from the outside world resolves it and the very young baby and indeed many children up to certain ages and let us confess many adults are not able to meet or adjust their internal states of stress and they look to things outside of them that is the first rule the fundamental rule that we all learn when we come into life that when in a state of discomfort to look outside are immediate biology beyond the confines of our skin and find a solution a simple water for adults it might be symbofalcohol right probably not the best tool to relieve stress but that is one that many people do in fact engagen for the baby that is hungry the botdle milk comes from outside as we gain more proficiency in moving through life and we can get things for ourselves we still often bring things from the external world in to resolve this what i'm calling autonomic dis a discomfort ere autonomic disregulation that is not a game but that is a ruld as we advance from infant to toddler we start to think more in terms of where we are and what we own relative to what is aut there in the world and now in the world of child psychology there is a somewhat famous poem that was written by a research child psychologist is name was burton white and hewrote a poem called the toddler's creed the toddler's creed definds well what the rules in contingencies of play are in very young children and it reveals to us just how narrow and limited their world view is and how self centered their world is the toddler's creed read quickly cause tie on't one take up too much time with this is if i wantit it is mine if i give it to you and change my mind later it is mine for anyone that is played with a toddler you can imagine this your mind if i can take it away from you it is mine if i had a little while ago it is mine if we are building something together all the pieces are mine if it looks just mine it is mine if it is mine it will never belong to any one else no matter what and of course as we hear this sounds quite awful right and yet this is actualy a reflection of what a healthy toddler would think about the world that the objects and things and even the people in the world or theirs that they are actually possessions that belong to them of course some people never actually transition beyond this stage of a moral and a social development and are indeed some adults that fit the toddler's creed and you are welcome to share this with them if ever you think that it might be of benefit to a their self reflection but in all seriousness burton whites toddler's creed is really grounded in this transition from when we are infants and we have to have things delivered to us to the point where we are todlers and we can acts ess things in the world but we tend to assume that they are all ours and then the next stage is the really key stage as it relates to play because in the next stage of development is where young children start to interact with other children and there is an exchange and a possession and in a letting go of certain things learning that not everything is yours and that the entire world is not about you is one of the key contingencies that is established during play it is one of the key ways in which children go from being very self centered and basily unable to engage with other kids for very long without some sort of eruption of crying and on some sort of battle you con pushpull over an object to things sharing and things cooperative play as we transition from forms of play that are all about the self that are a m mi mi mi mi the toddler's creed to forms of play that involve some discomfort in assuming rolls that may be we do not want and not getting what we want it is really an opportunity for the brain to start to explore different rolls that people take how they work is individuals and is pairs and enlarger groups and to do that in a low stakes environment i you would not want this to be worked out on the battle field or when searching for food or in some high stakes environment where the survival of the species was important it appears that these circuitries for play evolved that rules in contingencies around whose most important whether not the group is important whether not individuals are going to be leaders or followers et cetera that can be explored in a low stakes environmen now there are hundreds of different types of play and hundreds of different types of contingency testing but the key theme here is that play allows children and adults for that matter to explore different outcomes in a cind of low stakes environment if you are playing aboard game or a card game you might get really into that game but unless there is a lot of money on the table to speak or you really playing for something important or unless your ego is swollen way out of proportion to reality if you lose you might not feel good about it but it is truly not the end of the world and if you win you migh feel really good about it but you are not really incredible you are just incredible in that particular situation for that particular moment it does not really transform the rest of your life unless that game is of a particular typelic for sport for instance we will talk about sport later the key theme here is that play is contingency testing play is contingency testing under conditions where the stakes are sufficiently love that individuals should feel comfortable assuming different rolls even rolls that they are not entirely comfortable with in their outside life and that all relates again to the release of these indogenous opioids in this brain center parioqueducal gray and the way that allows the prefront of quartex in a very direct we me ntruly it allows it in a biological way to expand the number of operationc that it can run and start thinking about well ka normally i'm kind of aloner and i to read and work and and you no hang out alone aben play alone but all call play aboard game or a game of tenniswere have a partner and wereng to play is partners against to other people or can that is a ltle uncomfortable a but i'll do it and in doing that you discover cir tin ways in which you are proficion and certain ways in which you are less proficient you discover that the other person actually ah tends to cheat a little bit or the other person is extremely rigid about the rules or maybe extremely rigid about the way they organize their pieces on the board or they are crossing the line into your side of the tennis court there are all sorts of thngs that we learn in these rather low stakes senarios that is the key theme here before i continue i just want to point to a tool that any one can use but in particular the less playful of the group and i'd put myself into this category thand i'm not somebody who really engages in spontaneous play ah i enjoy sports i enjoy exercise but that is distinct from play because the sports and exercise that i engage in i take pretty seriously they are not low stakes for me i put ishould put a lot of importance on them she as i'm saying all this i prowly to put a less importance on them and have a lomore fun with those and yet what i'm about to tell you is that any one and every one can benefit from engaging in a bit more of this playful mind set the playful minds that is not necessarily about smiling and jumping around or being silly it is not it at all it is not the tigger character a for wenni the poo necessarily it could be but it is really about allowing yourself to expand the number of outcomes that you are willing to entertain and to think about how you relate to those different outcomes what this means is putting yourself into snaras where you might not be the top performer right playing a game that you are not really that good at i have this experience recently ive friends that to play cards they to do some low stakes gambling the znany legal gambling ring they play for trivial things and i generally do not buy into the game i generally do not play mostly because they nd of winning and taking whatever it is thati have but in the mode of assuming a more playful spirit the idea would be well if the stakes are low enough then to play simply for the sake of playing because there is something to learn there about the other people in the group and about one self and how one reacts to things some one whos i'm clearly trying to take everybody's money or somebody who is i clearly trying to a cheat or somebody whose clearly very very rigid about every last detail including how the cards are delt and shuffle right there is learning in this exploration and that is at a biological level the prefronts al quartecs starting to entertain different possibilities starting to entertain different outcomes in this low stakes way and if you think about it that is not something that we allow ourselves to do very often even if we listen to new forms of music or i we go see new art or new movies those are new experiences but that is not us making new predictions about what is going to happen next it is not the brain working to figure out new possibilities and can immediately see how just a small increase in your willingness to put yourself into conditions where you do not understand all the rules perhaps or you are not superperficient at something but you enter it because it is low stakes and because there is information to learn about yourself andothers could start to open up these prefrontal quartec circuits and when i say open up i do not mean that literally there is an opening in your skull what i mean is that your prefruntal quartecs can work in very rigid ways meaning if ay then be if i go down this street turn left and go that way to work it is fast if i go down the other street it is slow if there 's a traffic jam there i'm goingto go there but it is starting to explore different possibilities and theire very very few opportunities in life to explore contingencies in this low stakes way such that it engages in eural postasy the prefrontal quartexs play is powerful at making your prefronta quartecs more plastic more able to change in response to experience but not just during the period of play but in all senarios becauseyou get one prefrontal quartecs you do not get a prefrontal quartects just for play you get a prefrontal quartects that engages in everything going forward i will layer on some more concrete aspects of tools but for now if you are somebody that does not consider yourselfe particularly playful consider and may be t engage in just a little bit of play in some way that is of discomfort to you with the understanding that is increasing your prefrontal quartical posticity another really interesting and important aspect of play is call play postures these are seen in animals and these are seen in humans and for those of you that are watching this podcast on you too i'll do my best to adopt them here for thosewho eithere listening yot is have to imagine them in your minds eye but yach pangse and indeed darwin himself study these play postures that all animals engage in perhaps the most familiar one is seen in dogs and in wolves where they will lower their head to the ground and theyll put their paws out in front of them and they will make ey contact with another typically dog or wolf to called call the play now when they do this posture it is obvious that thei're lowering themselves theyre not in an aggress of stands because they are lowering their head and this is universally known among canines as play posture some famous vidios on line you can look these up of dogs ashally doing this with bears that they are confronted with and the bears at least in these vidios in exchange also lowering their head and there you see bear dog playful interactions now you always have to be cautious with bears in general i would say you have to be cautious with bears but this speaks to the universality of this bowing this sort of the that wit some people cal the puppy bower the play bow that dogs do turns out tha humans do this as well although in a different form msure there are some that go into the the down dog play posture but more typically when humans want of play they will do a subtle or not subtle head tilt the head tilt with eyes open is considered the universal head and ficial xpression posture of play in humans when two people see one another if there are aggressive towards one another they will soon certain facial expressions and postures but if theyr feeling playful towards one another oftentimes they'l tip their had to the side just a little bit and the open their eyes they might even raise their eyebrows briefly this has been seen again and again and again another hardwired feature of call play postures is what is called soft eyes when animals are aggressive or when their sad they tend to reduce the sizes of their eyeopenings by a basically making their eyelids closer together somewhat but keeping their eyes together in particular for aggression they will bring their eyes towards what we call avergence eye movement bring it towards the center that actually narrows that the aperture the visual field when people or animals want to engage in play they tend to open their eyelids somewhat and they tend to purse their lips just a little bit not drawing repertn onyour lips this it is pursing their lips the open their eyes a little bit and t often do the head tilt as well sometimes with a little bit of a smile these are reflecive these are not trained up children do this adults do this dogs wolves do this even certain birds will do this most birds have eyes on the side of teir heads but they do a sort of form of this soft eyes approach and certainly in raptors you see a softening the eyes and indeed raptors howk and eagles they actually do have a certain form of play but only early in life the other thing that we see during play are what are called partial postures partial postures or a kind of play anactment of postures that would otherwise be threatening a partial posture that we see during play in animals in humans that relates to aggressive play things restling or things roughen tumble play which is very common in animals and kids and some adults is that because there is going to be physical interaction in animals what will happen is they will march toward one another often very slowly but rather than having their hair up which u we call pilo erection which is when the hair goes up animals do this to make themselves look bigger think about that the cat that is trina bigger or n animal that is being aggressive thine look bigger in the presence of a vay a a foe a different animal that theyre either going to try and kill or fight in someway even if it is to defend themselves partial postures occur when animals will approach one another but they will keep their fur down humans will do this too they will aapproach during play but unless its highly competitive play a football game or a boxing match they will actually shrink their body size somewhat we have hair on our bodies a some of us more than others a and that hair is capable of piloerection amit can stand up that is the hair standing up on end of phenomenon but most of us do not have enough hair on our abodies that we can actally use that to make ourselves a larger what you see with people who are about to engage in play is they tend to make their body a little bit smaller unless they are highly competitive and highly competive play is its own distinct form of play hat will talk about later such as during sport when the stakes are high a superbole footboll game revealing my ignorance about sportsyer the the superbole as it is dibily galled is a very high stakes came y salaries depend on its pontureships depend on it it is on telivision a reputations depend on it that is not really playing a game that is playing a very high stakes came and there you are not going to see these partial postures you are not in to see soft eyes and tilting of the head at least not between the opposing players on the team you can see quite the opposite a grunting screaming shouldering a people not blinking lowering their eyes or a rather a shrinking their eyes down to be to appear more aggressive these kinds of thing staring right through the other person in verbal threats et cetera that is not really play even though we say thei're playing a game of football it is very high stakes play what i'm referringk to hear is when it is fairly low stakes and we see this again in animals and human there many many of these partial postures again they happen spontaneously if someone ever looks at you and they tilt their head a little bit and they raise their eyebrows and they may smile la bit they are looking at you playfully that is the universal human exthame of i want a play ddo you want a play there is another play expression that is considered the most extreme of the come on let us play expressions and postures and this is one that seem in a lot of primates and indeed in some humans as well and that is the eyes wide open and believe hey're not tongue out it is the that kind of silly thing that is not i dont think that i've ever done that before am just that kind of thing is basically what primate species of all kinds and indeed we are old world primates as well do when they want to say i'm definitely here to play and that is why i'm here o kay it is it has this kind of silly look or connotation but if you watch chimpensees or you look it bonibos or even in the call new world monkeys which tend to be the smaller monkeys a old world monkeys tend to be the ones that in general am see the world as we do they hve what we call trycromacy im they the ones that often can look very human the new world monkeys tend to be the little ones in general i give you look trick here thell tool based on primatology if you see a monkey and it is making very slow movements or you see an ape of any kinds making very slow movements very likely to be an old world primate if you see a monkey and it is king very quick movements it is doing this kind of thing it is as could be a squirrel monkey could be a marmaset likely to be a new world monkey and they do not see the world that the same way we do they see the world more a dog they do not really see reds they see reds as orange et cetera can that is not a hard in fast rule and i'm sure the a primatologists are gin to come after me with whatever primatologus come afteryou with monkey biscuits or something that but in general it is a good rule of your a the zo and you see a slow moving monkey with slow deliberate gastures kind of moves its eyes makes eyeh contact every one and while those ten to be the old world primates those kind of giddery ones that look the really nervous wrapping their tail and kind of hiding there in old bundle lest them to be the new world monkeys unkind againd not a a a blackand white type division but that i'll get you most of the way the whole purpose of these partial postures or the tongue out thing is to limit power indeliberate ways to really take bodily expressions that could be pertrade or could be interpreted as aggressive or as threatening or as wanting to mate or is willing wanting to do anything for that matter and to limit the power with which they are expressed in very deliberate ways that is the af putting the hir down despight getting into a fighting stands that saying let us fight but i'm not really here to fight fight it is low stakes fighting i i pinia then i'll let you go or if you pin me then you ought to let me go and immediately you can start to see how play starts to call into action social dynamics ind which both parties have to make some sort of agreement about how high the stakes are now the failures to do this are also very informative in how we develop in social groups and this also can inform why some people really play well with others and other people do not and some people seem to get along well with groups and can handle other people in some people are very rigid factiva anecdote about this when i was a kid we's to play this game it is not a game i suggest but we see do what were called dirt clod wars a friend of mine his parents were generally not home in the afternoon we must have been ewhere around ten or eleven years old and wen ou would set up these two big dirt mounds we would shovel them to big dirt mounds on two sides of the yard and then we woud just take dirt clods and we throw them at one another and just have dirt clod wars again not suggesting this a i'm not responsible for what happens if you do but there were rules and the rules were for instance a you could not pack rocks into the dirt clods a and you could run across to the other side and you could jump on the other persons mounting to throw dirt clods in their gasas a stuff the we thought was entertaining but if some one got hit in the head generally there was an unspoken rule that you kind of stop and see whether or not they were damage or not before you would continue you could not continue pelting them and of course people broke this rule inifact i remember one kid i'm nickin a name him a because itually he is grown into a very of very hachly prominent and functional adult but he got hit once in the head and then i think some one had thrown had dirt clod shortly thereafter and all the sudden he just went into a rage picking up rocks and sticks and attacking another kid and clearly that was a case in which the rules of the game were now being violated but it served a very important purpose there was the typical thing the there were some tears i think ause i recall from one kid or the other there was snot coming out the nose and turning bright red a kid went home it was a mass the parents that had to say something or may be those a phone call do not quite recall how it got result but the ideas that there is an agreed upon sead of rules about how high the stakes are and what we are all going to do and this is separate from sport where there are clear ly define rules about what is out of bounds what is in bounds what sorts of behaviorswillget you a yellow card or red card for instance on the socrafield all animals including humans ar doing this lowstakes contingency testing and all animals including humans you will find start up the stakes and inevitably in group play one member of the group willcant of breake rules you see this also in puppies for instance puppies will bite one another with those sharp little needle puppy teeth our membering costelle have those teethose things were darne sharp and puppies will yelp when a one of their liter mates bites them that yelp actually serves a very important inhibitory function this is well defind to tell the other when that is too tough and this is how animals learn soft bite if they do not get that feed back from other litermates they never actually learn what is too hard and what is soft and humans do this as well now you can look at your adult counter parts and indeed we should probably look at ourselves and ask did we learn proper play contingency when we were younger do entend to take things too seriously do we tend to over react aggressively when other people are clearly engaging in playful a jabbing or sarcasm or things of that sort each of you will have a different experience of this but the point is that play serves many functions it is notcious about the self its also about interactions between multimle people it sabout rule testing and low stackes contingency rule breaking also serves an important roll as is with the example of the dirt cloud war on puppies biting other puppies et cetera and last but not least there different forms of play that help us establish who we will become as adults one of the more powerful of these is roll play whend children and sometimes adults will take on different roles that are distinct from their natural world roles in order to for instance establish hierchies some ones can to be the leader and some ones can be the follower some wonl be dominan and some will be submissive some one will a work alone other people work in a group these kinds of roll playing or again ways in which the prefruntal quartax has to expand the number of operations in nursencs we call these algarithms that has to run in order to make predictions you have to take in a lot of information about your environment all the time and make predictions but if you are suddenly cast into a new role well then you definilly have to make even more predictions from a different standpoints these are very powerful for teaching the brain how to function id a sister growing up i still have a sister fortunately and sheanor friends largely played with dulls and dull houses in in the room next door and they would take on different rols in fact some kids if they play alone will start to take on the role of leader by taking on an imaginary or creating an imaginary friend and yon my apologies to min my sibling but for long time she had an imaginary friend eventually that imaginary friend disappeared am i do not know the science around imaginary friends and what makes them disappear r not at what st ge development but imaginary friends or pretty common and that is just another way of being able to bossomebody around if that seour thing or to do engaging cooperative play we can look at the stage of development we call childhood and we can look at each stage of it and we can say well there all these different dimensions of play that really are about testing out how we feel comfortable or uncomfortable how we react good or bad how we react on with stress or with glee when others behave in certain ways and im hoping hise coming through is that play is not just about having fun play is about testing it is about experimenting and it is about expanding your brains capacity and that is through early in development and its true throughout the life spand at this poin the discussion i want to take a step back look at the biology and neurochemistry of play just a little bit and in doing that really define what is effective play if the goal of play is to explore different contingencies in low stakes environments and to expand the function of our prefrontal quartex tat we can see new possibilities and new ways of being become more flexible more creative more effective outside of the games of play or the arenas of play i should say well then we should beasking how do i know if i'm playing how do i know fon playing correctly turns out there is an answer to that earlier i referred to this brain area the periaqueductal gray that releases opioids endogenius opioids into our brain and body and tends to relax us a bit it actually is what leads to these things soft eyes and head tilts and puppies making a puppy posturs and things of that sort and how that opens up the number of different functions or algarithms that the prefrontal quartex can run but there is another piece of the puzzle which is for something to genuinely be play and playful and for it to have this effect of expanding our brain and engaging neuroplasticity of really changing our brains that we can see and engage in more possible behaviors and thoughts et cetera we also have to have low amounts of a drenoline called epinaperon in our brain and body now the background science for this is quite extensive but it for those of you ther are interested in a papers in manuscripts a perhaps the best one is a review published in neuroscience an byo behaviourar reviews by the very yacpangcept although he has a coauthor which is steven sivy as ivy i why i'll provide a link to this in the caption shown outs and the title of this paper is in search of the neurobiological substrates for social playfulness in mamalian brains and it is a quite extensive review but it basely boils down to some key findings whereby any sorts of drugs or behaviors or cenarios that increase levels of a drenolin too much we will tend to inhibit play and drogs and senarios and i'm not suggesting recreational drugs here but these were experiments that were done in t laboratory seiding that increase the indogenous opioid output will tend to increase playfulness and really the state of mind that one needs to adopt when playing is first of all you efe to engage in the play whatever it happens to be with some degree of focus and seriousness and focus and seriousness in the nermiological contacts generally means epineperan o being able to focus is largely reliant on things a drentline epinefran but also the presence of dopomine on which is a molecule that generates motivation and focus in concert with epineferan but also that the indogenous opoids be liberated and it is really the low stakes feature of play that allows those indogenis opioids to be liberated what i mean by that well if you are very very concerned about the outcome and you have put a lot of money on the table in a given game om or ah youre a football player in the superbowl or youre playing a game for which defeating the other person or your team winning is absolutely crucial to you well then that is not really going to engage the play circuitry on the contrary if youare engaging in those same behaviors or any other behavior in a way that you are simply there to explore but you do not have high levels of a drenaline in your system ou're not stressed about the potential outcome will then that constitutes play now that somewhat obvious on the one hand that you take seriously what you take seriously and you can be more playful about things that you do not take seriously but what is absolutely not obvious is that the state of playfulness is actually what allows you to perform best because the state of playfulness offers you the opportunity to engage in novel types of behaviors and interactions that you would not otherwise be able to access if you are focused on the outcome get a state of playfulness is absolutely critical not just during play but during competitive senarios of any kind i shall started to cultivate a practis related to this when i was in college i had this am and f general practice of when i wanted to learn something i would tell myself that it was the most important information in the world and that i was very very interested in iv can alli to myself and say am superinterested in i wontin the topics but superincious in this are superincious in that and i could sort of delude myself into being hyper focussed on whatever it is that i was learning in ways that surprised me however when we are hyper focused on something and we are rigidly attached to the outcome we cannot engage in flexible thinking it is a great tool to be hyper focused on something and take it very very seriously when we are simply trying to learn things by con of rope memory learne things thand regurgetate learn and regurgetate of the sort that yom frankly a lot of of schooling involves but if we a are trying to get better at something we sort of hid a wall and athletic performance ore incognave performance were we are not creative enough or we are finding less just use a sports example that we only have a certain number of moves that we can deploy are cerain number of swings of the racket that we can deploy the way to actually expandior practice is to engage in this kind of low stakes thinking the idea that well i'm just gon a kind of play and tinker i'm going to explore in a way that it is really matter if the ball goes back over the net the en only matter of the ball goes in the whole and it counterintuitive because you think no the thing that we need to do is drill and drill and drill and drill an andee there is a place for that but this mode of play with modest levels of ndogenius opioids being released in our system pluss low levels of a drenlin really apineffran low levels of epinafronand drentlin are possible only when the stakes are low enough that we are not stressed well that commination really allows the prefrontal quortecs to explore different possibilities in ways that can truly expand our capabilities over time now this has been seen again and again also in the business sector some of the a were a challenging or ashes a competitive companies to get jobs that are very interested and hiring people that as children were called tinkerers and actually nasso was first of famous for this that many of the people that achieved great success in engineering at nassa when they looked back into their childhood am histories those people tended to be tinkers they wreveele it would kind of play with things in a way that a was not about rigidly following a recipier an instruction manual great cooks discover new forms of food a indy create entire jonras of food a by way of being tinkers a musicians do this a i gr plaing verious sports but scapeboarding was one that i was particularly ivolved in for a long time a one of the great escapewoarders of alltime is a some you may recognize his name as the great rodny mollin an rodny was kind of famous for a evolving the sport and continued of all the sport ing ways that no one could prodect using scapeboards and all sorts of ways that no one had thought of previously and of course their other scapewords that did that is well but he is particularly well known for that and his process is a his own i cannot speak to it am too much but he was also known is a kind of tinkeror as somebody who would spend a lot of time just kind of flipping the board and just am flipping in in the air and watching the ways in which have flipped and kind of studying the physics of of it really and et expanding on is existing understanding of what could happen on e scapeboard by way of just playing now he took it very seriously but it is this kind of razor's edge between taking something very seriously but also tinkering and playing and exploring and just seeing what happens a conom ling well was just see what happens if we did this that mine sat is extremely powerful to export from this thing that we call play into what we could call more serious endeavors of one's occupation or sport whether not its behind a desk or whether or not its running around on a field really for or engineering any endeavor and the whole purpose of this episode on play is yes on the one hand to illustrate the incredible a evolutionary utility of play for setting up a the self and relation of the self to others indeed for setting up cultures entirely cause cultures will watch sport together or they will celebrate their team winning am in wirl cup nerben a bigsocraphan even thugh my dat is argentine a but it is incredible im in the entire world con o lights up and gets engaged around whether not their team their country is going to win the olympics also being another example but play and sport are not quite the same as i've pointed out before and for all of us who are thinking about tools and things that we can extract from science to enrich our lives i would say for those wo view that are already playing on a regular basis in one form another terrific start to expand other forms o play in particular forms of play that involve new groups of individuals if youre somebody that typically plays one on one with somebody try to expand into playing as teams if you are somebody who only play is alone then try to expand into playing in a perhaps one on one forst and in groups this is the way that your brain learns and evolves and changes and gets better and i raise this because another one of the topten questions i get is how can i keep my brain young how can i continue to learn how can i get better in school in sport in life and relationship is et cetera emotionally cognively and on and on and on and yes there are supplements that can support in our aplasticity yes there are brain games and aps they can support noir oaplasticity but if you really want to engage in or oplasticity at any age what you need to do is return to the same sorts of practice is in tools that your nervous system naturally used throughout development and that evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to trigger this thing that we called neir oplasticity and the reason this is importan is because it starts to move us away from what some people called hacts i defind haxes using one thing for a diferent purpose to kind of i get a short cut i do not really the term frankly and i do not it because it is not grounded in any biological mechanism but when we look at play we can say play is the portal to plastcity play at every stage of life is the way in which we learned the rules for that stage of life and play is the way in which we were able to test how we might function in the real world contact play is powerful and we could even say that play is the most powerful portal to plasticity the reason for that is that yes this high opioid low epinepran or a geneal in state is what opens up play but then inside of the arena of play when the prefuntial quortixs is running all these different possibilities in this low stakes way but with some degree of focus there are number of other chemicals that are to ployed things brain derived neutrophic factor and other growthactors that actually trigger the rewiring of brain circuits that allow for it to expand and indeed that is what is neuro plasticity if you are interested in those chemicals and the kond of a rena of things that happen when one engages in neuro plasticity is a vast literature out there but one of the o more popular books that i think its quite good is from my friend ind collic john rady whose a psycaatris at harvard medical school that is are a t e wy he wrote the book spark o if a few years back and i think its still very relevant and john talks about a the important role that play exerts in the nero plasticity process and points to a number different protocalls that one can engageion he also points to the importance of navigating new environments did not just go on the same height every week or take the same walk but as huall get into new novel environments your string ist sends te theme here there is novelty a exploring contingencies keeping the stakes relatively low et cetera et cetera but these really are the gates to this holy grail that we called neuro plasticity nor plasticity as i've talked about in the plodcas before is a two step process it involves focusing very intensely or at leasts focusing somewhat on whatever it is that one is trying to learn and then engaging in deep rest ideally deep sleep in the following nights and i've also talked about the benefits of things naps in yoganedra called anesty are non sleep deepreset for inhancing or accelerating plasticity you can check out the episodes on focus at a cuberman lavdot calmer the a episodes on how to learned faster the detail all those we had a news letter a that lists out all the a tools for neuro plastisi and hancing neuro plastisy all that is available zero plose to you at hubrm labdot come et cetera you can just download on that information but john's book that news letter those episodes they really point to this twostep process where it is focus and than rest focus and than rest and play is its own unique form of focused and than rest focus and rest it is not the same as learning something for sake of school or it critically trying to learn a motor behavior for sake of sport it is really about expanding the number of things that you could learn down the line oq said once again just one may sure it is abundantly clear play is about establishing a broader frame work within which you can learn new things it is not about learning some specific thing it is not about the game you happen to be playing it is not about the doll house that the kids are playing with that they become amazing doll house players when they grow up right the dirt clod war that i referred to earlier o for better for worse a was not about becoming the best dirt clod thrower on ordn winning the trophy for dirt clods in the neighborhood although we actually had atrophy for best dirt clodta om alas it was not my deem that year but the the point is that your learning rules and establishing a broader foundation of practices that then you can learn more things within that context thus far i've tried to convince you through a commination of data and anecdote and explanation that adopting a stance of playfulness and indeed ing aging in play on a somewhat regular basis could be beneficial to you regardless of circumstances or goals if i have not done that already what iam about to tell you hopefully will push you over the line it turns out that when you look across the kingdom of oll animals what you find is that animals that engage in playful behaviors for the longest period of time are also the animals that have the greatest degree of nerrow plasticity the brain and nervous systemsability to change in response to experience put differently animals that only play for very small fraction of their entire life have very rigid brains that do not learn new things where as animals that play for a long period throughout their life have very plastic brains and there is even some evidence thats this point largely anecdotal but there some data starting to emerge that adults that maintain a playful stancs that engage in things again that are low stakes contingency exploring important enough that people focus and that people pay attention to what they are doing but that they are not you will filled with a drenaline you nov freaked out about the outcome being a or be they are not super supercompetitive may be just a little bit competitive or not competitive at all that allows for more on going plasticity and one of the people that comes to mine in thinking about this is of course the physicist and i should say the great physicists richard fine mand noable prize wint or professor caltec a it was balved in the man hattin project but was also known for being a lifelong tinkerer i he also is a mischievous tinkerer if you read any of the books about finemen or by fine men sureliyor joking mister fine men or what you care what other people think these are wonderful short stories mostly about finemen doing things a picking all the locks at the losalamos laboratory and putting all the top secret documents out on the floor of the office o that when people came in in the morning they were all out there a obviously they were not release to the general public am he did not want to threaten national security playing pranks that o anactually caltec am i do not now if this is still the case but caltec where he was employed was always known for i'm doing very technalogically challenging a pranks they are not known for their athletic prowess at caltecs arry caltec but a they were known for exampl am distrupting the scoreboard at the rosebowl a in pacadina for instance and things of that sort through technological feats hat least at the time required a lot of am playfulness and techna logical prowess if you look in science or you look in art or you look in medicine or you look in any domain what you find is the people that continue to evolve new practice is tend to be people that were tinkers people that are very creative tend to be people that are unafraid of exploring things in a this low ustakes way they are not rigidly attached to the outcome that they have to do everything perfectly all the time now they might cloak these playful behaviors that their final works always look perfect or always look in credible but they have this kind of playful nature about them i would venture even to say that the a the street artists banky for instance obviousy an incredible artists puts a ton of thought and preparation into their work am but there is a kind of playfulness to the whole thing too thof using a two dimentional paintings in concert with three dimentional city dwellings in ways that now i think that most people had not previously thre were other people cristo and artists of that sort that did that but i think a bankee is cn of recognizes the modern a the modern rendition of that kind of playfulness using cities in ways that most people do not use cities using artent ways that am most people do not use art for instance to go back to the example of finemen finemen with somebody who learn to paint and draw quite well into a sixties was somewhat famous or infamous i should say for bongo drumbing on the roof of caltec i say am infamous because he awas known also for doing that naked am something that icertainly not ainconcert with the athi gls tanderds and behaviors of universities to day but fine men had this playful spirit as a child he had that playful spirit is a teanagor and he had that playful spirit as an adult and that is one of the hall marks of finemen was that he was in just a a rigid physicist to could explain things clearly the general public he always carried through this playful spirit and in some of his writings he pointed to the fact that that playful spirit with something that he worked very hard to continue to cultivate in himself because it was the way in which he could see the world differently and to indeed make great discoveries in the feel the physics but also to can of evolve his relationship to life more generally and he comes to mind is as a prominent example of somebody who who did this and if i could achieve anything with this episode besides teaching you something about the biology of play would be to teach you about the utility of play again i'm do not consider myself a particularly playful person by nature but i've tried over the years to adopt this stance of exploring things that are a very focust on contingencies of different kinds but keep the stakes low enough that i can have some fun doing them and i to think that it is benefited me somewhat i to drill a little but further into this thing that we call narrow plasticity again nerrow plasticity is the brain in nevous systems ability to change in response to experience and i should just say that throughout the entire life span the nervous system can change very quickly in response to negative experiences we can almost all engage in what is called one tral learning where if something really terrible or tramatic happens to us aue nervous system will rewire almost immediately least within a few days such that we tend to want to avoid the experience that led to that trama now the whole business of wi people return to things that are dramatic to them is a whole other issue there are are books about things troma bonding there is the called repetition compulsion a from cyconalysis that people go back in to troma to retest and gain new opportunities to overcome the troma et cetera et cetera but in general what i'm referring to here is you have a bad experience of the swimming pool when you are kid where some one holds your head under water too long than you just do not want to get back in the water that is one trial learning of sorts a that of course can be overcome through a proper exposure therape or some one that you trust taking you there or a any number of behaviors that allow you to overcome that be that particular cenario an experience something new in that same contect but accross the life spand the learning of new things new contingencies new possibilities occurs very differently from about age zero when we are born until about age twenty five and thereafter from about about i will not emphasize approximately aged twenty five onward ner plasticity occurs thrugh the proces that is exactly as i describe befor focus rest focus rest wou focus very intensely we cannot do the thing we cannot do the new movement we cannot do the gall swaying we cannot learn the math we try we try we try we try we sleep a few nights and than almo hn we can do it because the rewiring actually curs during deep brest or naps but mostly during deep sleep from birth till about aged twenty five however we can learn things new things and new contingencies not just negative things and tramatic things through somewhat passive exposure to those things rit i will never forget the first time that we wen on a family trip to washington de seeam went to the smisonian i got to see the the old fighter plains and i think i think the kittyhack or the first one of the first plains was they are anyway ivusly my recollection is not terrific my hyppocampasis is a flailing on that one but i'll never forget the trip and i'll never forget who went and i then os poltly eight or nine years old it is inbedded somewhere in my memory and just through passive experience and my focussing on the things that excited me about that trip i have a recollection of that experience i did not have to deliberately focus i did not was n'nt telling myself focus you can i need to remember this trip some day under youn be podcasting about this you knowind thirty nine years or whenever egan i forget exactly how old i was but the key feature here is that the developing brain is able to learn through passive experience because the nurons the nerve sells in the developing brain ar much more over connected then they will be later in life the way to think about this a sort of if you use gugel maps as i do a too often i think a when i drive there are number of roads in pathways that woul get you from poina to point be we could imagine those as neral circuts or we can imagine neral circuits as those roads early in development the nerve connections are much more extensive itit is having a gugl maps that where everything is connected to everything through tiny little prostreets in the whole thing is just a complete mess but then by taking particular routs of behavior of thought of emotion certain routs become well established and the other routes that are not taken simply disappear now in the biological contects in the brain we call that process pruning and the simple way to invision this is early development you have many many more nurans than you will have as an adult those nurans are extensively interconnected and a proximately forty per cent of those interconnections will disappear by time your twenty five years old they are gone they are actively removed through processes that involve things gleal cells that come in and literally sneak their little processes in between nurons at the synaps which are the points of contact in communication between yourn and push those apart evend eat nurons there is an incredible work from for instance beth stevens labit a harvard medical school showing that gleal cells going and eat synapses that are not functional for that particular circuit now what this tells us is that much of our learning during development is the removal of incorrect connections but it also involves the strengthening of connections that are going to cerve certain emotion certain functions a motor functions cogna functions et cetera the process of play is largely a prcess of engaging pruning of nural connections and strengthening of the remaining connections i'm sure that many of you have heard the term fire together wire together that phrase is often incorrectly attributed to the great donald heb who indeed was great thit incredible work a psychologist from canada who established a lot of the basic celler learning rules for learning in memory but it was the also great doctor carleschats who is now at stamford and o was at berkely and harvard as well but who is at stampher medical school who coin this term fire together wire together indeed that is what happens when children play when adolescence play and when young adults play whether not its social play or play with an object whetther not its a sporat or play of any kind imaginary play a imaginary friend play there is a strengthening of certain nurl connections and a pruning away of up to forty per cent perhaps even more of connections that are not necessary for certain types of behaviors emotions and thoughts what this means is that it is through the process of play that we become who we are as adults and as i mention early or it is through the process of play thatere we that we are able to adjust who we are as adults now there are bounds on this process as far as i know there is never been a reported case of an individual who had a hyper prostic or as ist a a brain that was as p plastic in adulthood as it was in childhood but what this tells us is that what we do in the process of play is children is really how we set up the rules for how we behave as adults in almost all domains which is really incredible and of course the reassuring thing is that playing as an adult will allow you to expand on those neurl circuits you can literally grow new connections some of you may be saing does it create new nurons as for better for worse it does not seem that many new nurons are added to your brain in adulthood there are some papers that report a few nurons in certain brain areas isolated brain areas but by nd large most of the requiring of neurl connections is the removal of certain connections this process were calling pruding and the strengthening of the remaining connections that make those kind of gugal maps roads in the analogy a laid out before thicker in more robusts think that is taking little trails and turning them into roads than paving those roads than turning those roads into highways than putting up a more lanes on those highways and eliminating all the small little back country roads that one could take and again this is an ananalogy for what is happening at the level of neural circuitry now one of the key findings that has emerge from the literature is that children that have been subjected to trama or immense amounts of stress of any kind have a harder time both engaging in play but also a harder time accessing neurl plasticity later in life the good news is this is not a permanent effect and will talk about some ofthe ways to overcome that o in a moment but this should make sense to you because earlier we talked about how a high level of a drenolin epineperon in the brain an body actually inhibits blocks the circuits in the brain and body that generate play behavior and when i say that i mean that in a very concrete way that epineperan an adrenline can actually suppress the sorts of circuitry that can lead to things soft eyes or tong out or the head tilt or what we called partial postures of being able to engage in a a rough and tumble play but not take that to the point of outright aggression in damaging the other person or them damaging you when i say that traman stress can inhibit nera plasticity by way of inhibiting play at a deeper nerobiological level what i am really saying is that the high levels of a drenoline that are generated from traman stress actually shut down the circuits that allow a thild or a young adult to enter the game of play or engage in the game of play in the same way that a child or young adult who did not have high levels of drenalan than in their system could possibly engage in now the good news is that many of the existing tramatherapes that are out there now including things em diare exposure therape cognive behavioraltherape and on and on including some of the a theropies that are more norchemical things chedamene or a are more engineering based a things transcrenual magnetic stimulation for instance many of those are paired with forms of talk therabe that are really about the same thing that play is about which is exploring different contingencies it is about exploring different types of emotional experiences as they relate to the same sort of senareo that created the trama and we did not entire episode on fear in trama and i recommend you check out that episode its easy to find again at huberman labdot comits on you to bapples bodify et ceter et cetera very easy to find and there i talk all about trama treatments and the various kinds of trama treatments that are out there there a efficacy in different senareos an tramas and on but the point i to make now is that the reason why children who experience a lot of trama an stress have limited plasticity later on is because of the norchemical substraits that are created from trama an stress cause after all stress is epinepring an epineprn isstress those are inseparable and the way in which it more less shuts down or at least in hibits suppresses those play circuits and againd the reassuring thing is that by engaging in play as adults we can reactivate some of those circuits and reopen the plasticity in fact wone very prominent trama treatment now especially for people that have a been subjected to very severe tramas at inin the on going sense meaning tramas that went on for many many years is to get them to engage in play in things dance in basically getting them to engage their bodily movements and ways that they would otherwise not feel comfortable to engage in and i find this area interesting because on the face of it you could say allo that is kind of u knows that really bio medical treatment an you taking people or tramatize ind having them dance i mane seems kon of silly on the one hand depending on eure your a particular a orientation but on the other hand its actually quite profound and quite grounded in the mechanisms by which the braince circuits change again back to this original principle which is that play is not just one portal to plasticity play is the fundamental portal to plasticity and that play and dance and exploration of novel movements exploration of novel athletic movementsn are the rout by which we access new ways of thinking new contingencies and i find it wonderful that the trama release and the a psychiatric in psychology community are exploring things play and dance and other forms of a reopening these circuits because indeed we would all love for there to be a magic pill by which trma could be erased an new memories could be laid down or a device that could do that but frankly if a you ask me or a number of my college whether not that likely to happen any time soon an effective way i think the the short answer is going to be know that they are going to be chemicals and th ings that can augment and support that process but that there is not going to be just a magic pill that will suddenly reverse trama altogether that it is always going to be a case whereby shifts in nor chemical states are going to have to be combined with new ways of thinking and new behaviors and i find it wonderful and reassuring that people are looking at play and play behavior as a not just one tiny shard of possibility there but that it might actually be the main driver and a highly productive lever by which to rewire the tromatized brain fear me you might be thinking o ke i am willing to be more playful i am willing to explore play as a portal to plasticity and that all makes good sense but what should i play what should i do well we have already establish that you want to keep your drenal and low you have to keep the stakes slow enough that you are not ging to get totally consumed by the outcome now for some people who are highly competitive that is going to be challenging and yet i do not want to make it seem as if you cannot be competitive during play thereare many forms of competitive play that because you are competitive person allow you to derive great joy from that competitive play i have a friend whose particularly good t horseshoes i 'm not particularly good at horseshoes but whenever we play horseshoes i can tell he is out there to crush me on horseshoes as just one of these things where i can tell he derived great pleasure from crushing me at a game of horseshoes i cannot say because i have an actually don the mecrodilsis which is a way of extracting chemistry from the brain in real time nor have i recorded from his brain or imageit in a scanner whether or not i yes high levels of epan effran or low levels of a panefran during those games of horseshoes i suspected as low levels of epinefran and high levels of dopaming especially when he wins and yes he wins every time but the point is that you can be competitive during play provided that you were enjoying yourself oka you can be competitive provided that youare enjoying yourself there are particular forms of play that lend themselves best to neral plasticity and those particular forms of play again are not designed to necessarily just engage the plasticity that allows you to perform that behavior but rather to expand the number of possibilities for your brain to change in general throughout life and the two major forms of those for which there is good pure reviewed research is to engage in novel forms of movement including different speeds of movement let say for instance your somebody who runs i happen ta running i tryingt run three times a week an generally when i run i run forward i do not run backward although recently because i've become very excited about the work of called knees over tosgy his name is ben parker o but he goes by knees over tosguy on instrogram i've never met him but of we have exchange a few messages back and forth an some of his practices involve on walking backwords or r i'm doing sled pulls backwards i've found these to be very beneficial for my back and for my interior to bealus and some things that have really helped with my posture and forth but in general when i run i run forward i do not ten to run backward that much and i might do that for a few minutes at the end but not much a throughout the entire run running does not lend itself to a lot of novel forms of movement lateral movements o for the nerds out there movement in the sagunal plaine a or angled movements but it does appear that things dance or sports where you and generating a lot of dynamic movements where there is jumping where there is movement at different angles where there is ducking whe theres leaping that basically involve a lot of dynamic movement and are not just strictly linear those seem to open the portals for plasticity and that is because they mimic a lot of the brain circuitry that is associate with play and the reason for that is the way in which those dynamic movements and movements of different speeds engage the vestibular system the balant system the vestibular system is in the inner ear relates to the cerebellum which translate the minybrain yellow miny brain inthe back your brain it brings together visual information in a very direct way i talked a lot about this in the episode on how to learn faster s if you want to going depth on how vestibular and diffentipes of motor movements can open plasticity i tocca bit more i should say a lot more there but suffice to say that engaging in play that has a lot of dynamic movement or movements of different speeds things dance things sports socker r moving in different dimensions that tends to be very conducive to what we would call play related circuitry provided you do not take it too seriously you do not get those high levels ofoup ben efferon now for those of you that are also interested in non physical or non athletic forms of play that can really expand plasticity there some very interesting research about the game of chess i do not play the game of chess i've played a few times i confess i do not know how to move all the pieces i'm not contrying to scribe that here but i've always wanted to learn chess and i think after reading some of the pure reviewed research about chess and play in neroplascisy now i understand why there is a really nice paper that was published in the international journal research in education and science in twenty seventeen and the title of this paper is is chest just a game or is it a mirror that reflects a childs inner world not's a very aw a very intense title for a biologists me ah but this paper is interesting because what it really points to is the fact that in a single game chess you have s at least as i understand two players and those two players are moving pieces on the chest board for which each piece can do different things sor i can movein different ways under different cenarios but ther different rules for different pieces and each player actually has to assume multiple identities during the same game and each of those identities has different rules and ways of interacting noway we can think of chess as one game but actually chess is a on ave a substraight for exploring multiple rolls for different characters and this is quite a bit different then for instance vidio games where somebody has their favorite vidio game player or they ave an avatar and there always in the same roll it is also quite a bit different for when you engage in any kind of play where you are yourself youre just being you in that game and now i am highly incentivized to explore chess m you see quotes out there for instance a things chess is life or jugitzu is life i always assumed that ment that some one's entire life was chess or their entire life was jugitzu for instance but in reading over the research about chess in particular but also certain forms of marshal arts also certain forms of dance what one finds is that indeed those games are life in the sense that they involve adopting multiple rolls and exploring contingencies in a number of different ways there are some games that allow you to explore a much vaster landscape of movements or of mental rolls or of ways of engaging in strategic movement as is the case with chess and when you hear that a activity blank is life i it often reflects the passion for that activity but i think looked at differently it also reflects the fact that that activity is a portal through which you can explore life through many many different diflenses and i think that that is especially powerful in terms of thinking about how play can be leverage for plasticity for those of you that are interested in leveraging play for narrol plasticity and expanding your mind if you will i highly recommend picking an activity that will allow you to adopt different rolls within that activity where it is not rigidly linear this is actually a way in which i start to depart from this modern and important but somewhat narrow idea that exercise is the only rout to plasticity yes it is true i have nobo prize whening colleagues that swim for two miles a day and have done that for a long time and they will tell you i always think more clearly after my swimming and i certainly in my experience after a good run or a good work out my mind seems to work best a unless of course that work out was very very intense ave talked about the s before if you to work out very very hard in whether not's a robic or resistance training or sport of any kind your brain will not function as well afterwards mostly because of the diversion of oxygen to a tissues away from your brain aft your gaing less oxygen to your brain but in general most of us feel that if we exercise regularly are brain functions better but there are activities that extend beyond lineor exercise be beyond just genering the same sets of movements over and over again wether not its exercise or not and that is really what play is play is about dynamically exploring different kinds of movements dynamically exploring different kinds of thoughts dynamically exploring different kinds of rolls that one could adopt and that is the way that the brain learns new things i encourage you to explore chess i intend to learn chests this year i'm very excited to do that now fyou already play chess and you are an expert chest player you actually will derive less benefit in terms of this play induced neroplasticity than you would for instance if you went out and i do not know play to game a socker or did something that was very novel for your nervous sistem because in that novelty and in that exploration of new behaviors and new ways of thinking you are opening the portal to plasticity whereas in doing what you already know how to do and trying just to perform better and better at it you will get better at chess but again that is just chess you are not expanding the realms in which you can become more plastic that you are able to learn new things in relationship in life in finance in friendship et cetera in researching this episode one of the most interesting areas i discovered was this notion of personal play identity personal play identity is a term that at least to my knowledge was coined by a turkish researcher by the name and forgive me i'm going to miss pronounce this is gohon gunes g o k h a n last name g u nd e s and forgive me gochon and if a we have any a turkish speaking members of the audience please put the correction in the a common section on you to of make it fonetic i can understand what it is please i'd love to correct it and a apologies or who knows if i got it right then i was purelock gocon gunas has coin this term personal play identity and the key roll that personal play identity establishes in who we see ourselves as being and notcious in the context of play personal play identity has four well defined dimentions and i should say that if your interested in learning more about this the a the paper that i found a particularly informative is published in current psychology and the title is personal play identity and the fundamental elements in its developmental process and the author of course is gochon gunes g n e s last name this is from twenty twenty one recent review there are four components to personal play identity how you play your personality sosio culture and environment that is the third onetogether socio culture environment an economics and technology now that sound somewhat complex and this paper is somewhat complex but basically what it says is that we bring together certain aspects of ourselves and how we react a different place and areos when we are younger and we bring that forward into the world in all context as adults to illustrate this iman ask you a question when you were a child wets say ten years old would you considered yourself competitive would you h consider yourselve somebody whose cooperative and realize a course of those are not mutually exclusive you could be competitive and co operative would you consider yourself somebody that preferred to play alone or preferred to play with one or two close friends or were you somebody that really enjoyed playing in large groups here is a key one were you somebody that enjoyed playing the leader in one moment and was equally o ke with being a follower at a later moment were you oke with having your rule switched midway through a game were you get upset or be delighted or not care at all about having a switch teams during the midle of game because your teem was winning i to even things out you can imagine how that would a play out internally you would immediately register that you must be a valuable player because you rebeing moved off the winning team toward the losing team but then again your now being forced to join the losing team how did you feel about that were you somebody that was comfortable with other people breaking rules or perhaps even your self breaking rules or bending rules cano beal to find term or were you somebody that wreally need to know all the rules and if everyone did not rigidly adhere to those rules was quite disturbed by that the number of questions goes on and on and on and i will provide a link to a paper that asks a number of questions that helps you arrive at a a sort of score of sorts are an index of what gunes and others have referred to as personal play identity the point is that if we look back to our early adolescence somewhere between ten an fourteen years old a pique time for social development a pique time for play of various kinds a pique time for motor development a pique time of psychlo social development where we learn where we fit into hire keys as we relate to members of the same sects of the opposite sex et cetera we can start to get a portal into how and why we show up to various activities in work in relationship et cetera as adults in fact i'll venture to say that if we go into that process for ourselves for five or ten minutes you start to see some remarkable parallels between the way you were at that stage and your tendenciyes and your preferences as adults we tend to look at our early childhood experiences and our families and to some degree our friends in terms of how we become who we become i've talked about the incredible work of allanshore on previous episodes of the podcast allanshore is a psychatrist and has done extensive work on how parent child interactions in particular baby and mother but also baby and father shape the brain and the brain and emotional systems ability e go from states of elation and excitement the called dopomine epinephran type circuitry to the more warm soothing types of calm interactions that o in broad terms could be described as more ceratonan oxitosin than things of that sort that work really points to the key rolls that the care giver and the child you engaged in an early life and that is incredible work a do hope to host a doctor shawe on the podcast at some point in the not to distant future but equally important of course are the interactions that we explort from that early laying down of biological crcuitry and psychological circuitry to the way we play by ourselves and the way we play with others in small numbers or in great numbers and of course it would be the case that how we played as a ten or twelve year old would impact how we behave as a sixteen year old and as a twenty year old and as a third y year old and on and on one of my favorite things about developmental biology and developmental psychology is that it is grounded in the fact that we do not just have a childhood and an adulthood there is not just our child self and our adult self and even though there are transitions around the mechanisms that underlie neral plasticity at approximately aged twenty five it is simply the case that development is our entire life span that our life span is one long developmental ark how long depends on our genetics are life style accidents injury and disease of course but it is one long developmental ark and it should surprise us at all that how we learn to play as a ten year old or twelve year old would impact how we play and interact with people as a teen ager and a young adult and on and on and on and that play is th place in which we explore and which we learn play is the substrate by which our nervous system changes us from this hyper connected batch of norons where everything is connected everything more or less to a brain and nervous system whereby certain circuits work with immense proficiency and others are less accessible to us but again the wonderful thing about the human nervous system is that because it is plastic for the entire life span and because these two elopments of focus and rest can be deployed again and again and again just because nerral circuits in form does not mean that they cannot form later in life and to day we have been focusing on how play itself the same substrate that we use during development to become who we are is the porter by which we can change who we are for the better i hope i've convinced you that play is an extremely important fundamental homeostatically regulated aspect of our nervous system which is just a mouthful of nerve speek to say play can change your brain for the better and that is true for every stage of life the recommendation that i make and certainly the one that i'm going to direct it myself as well is to try and engage in at least one hour of pure play per week wi came to that recommendation because of the literature that says well neaun to engage in something pretty repetitively it should be novel this would not be something that you are exceptionally good at already if you insist on doing something that you are already exceptionally good at then you want to really do some free form low stakes tinkering make it safe but make it free form really explore things with that some people call this beginner's mind although i find that a little abstract i the notion of beginner's mind but how if youre in beginner's mind ithey beginner's mind is sort of the expectation that you are not kin to do it well yet but play extends beyond beginner's mind play is really about not even worrying if you'are ging to get good at it or really proficion at et it is really a bout exploring contingencies with truly low stakes that is what will allow you to access these nurochemical comminations of elevated indogenisopio it is low ap an ifferan et cetera that will open up nor plasticity for those of you that need a little more guidance on how to play a there is a book out there actually learn about this from timpharrisis bloge it is called play it away a worcoholic's cure for anxiety that is more focused on anxiety tha the author is charly hone last name o h o e h and will provide a link for it in the shownotes and caption play it away a work of all excure for anxiety but books and other resources aside i think one hour of play per week is a reasonable amount of time to engage in dedicated play behavior for the purpose of opening up these neural circuits for plasticity the key feature of course is to not have i ments proficiency in that given activity or at least not the way you perform it and if you do gain proficiency in that activity well then it become something else it is no longer about play it is about performance in that case you would then want adopt a new play behavior you will notice that i largely avoided using the word fun throughout this episode fun is a somewhat abstract term and many emotions and many a verbal descriptions of experience it fall short in the contexts of a neurobiological discussion about play if you have fun terrific some people might find however that engaging in play is kind of uncomfortable werl there your go then should be to lower level of discomfort by focussing less on the outcomes and just simply engaging in the behavior because well i'm telling you that it is good for you but hopfully you will tell yourself that it is good for you and that you will experience that it is good for you the literature certainly points to that and the literature certainly points to the fact that play is the way that we are built we are built to play we have brain circuits from back to front and within our body that are there for play and they do not disappear they do not get pruned away as we go from development to adulthood if ever you needed a neurobiological explanation for why play is important throughout the live spin it is that it is that biology does not waste resources it is extremely efficient and were the circuits for play not to be important in adulthood they would beimpruned away but i guarantee you they are there in your brain in nervous system now they will be theire tomorrow and they will be their going forward my suggestion is that you use them one hour per week if you are learning from and ore enjoying this podcast please subscribe to our utube channel

welcome to the huberman lad guest series where i and an expert guest i gust science an science ace woins rni ini man drew hubermen and i'm a professor of nerbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicin to day's episode marks the first in a series with doctor andy galpin doctor andy galpin is a professor of connesiology it calstate university fullerton and one of the foremost world experts on the science and application of methods to increase strength speed endurance hypertrophy and various other aspects of fitness exercise and sports performance across the six episode series doctor andy galpan pulls from his expertees working with everything from professional athletes to recreational exercisers and teach us us the mechanisms logic and specific protocalls for how to achieve any of the number of different exercise adaptations that i mention a moment ago ranging from strength to endurance hypertrophy and everything in between we get really far into details but at all times paing attention to the macroscopic issues that is how to create a program for endurance or strength or hypertrophy or speed or one that combines all of those we also talk about supplementation and nutrition and how to maximise recovery for each of the different types of exercise adaptations during to day's episode doctor galpanteaches us how to access our level of fitness and more generally how to think about fitness that we can best achieve are fitness exercise and performance schools doctor professor andy galpan superexcited to have you here therare such an immense treasure shrove of information on physical training and optimizing for specific goals and outcomes with physical exercise i'm curious however many people have different levels of fitness some people are professional athletes of course but most people are not many people exercise regularly some people are trying to do that more some people are doing too much of that theire overtraining they are not recovering enough if we were to take a step back and each an every one of us ask how fit are we with the word fit of course being a very brouhd incompassing word could compass endurance certainly does strength the ability to run fast even if for short distances it might even include hypertrophy or directed hypertrophry trying to balance one's musculature to offset a cymetries recover from injuries et cetera how should i or anyone else for that matter think about their level of fitness and i know my resting heartrate but what do i do in terms of really acsessing whether or not i'm as fit as i could be and should be both for sake of health and performance and here i'm asking the question not as an athlete but as somebody who as been pretty consistent as an exerciser but if we were to throw our arms around this question of how w do we assess our fitness what would be a for the different levels of a sestiment that we should think about and do when it comes to exercise people generally have to major goals in mind gol number one is achieving some sort of appearance why this is i want to be big or want o not o be too big or i want to be lean something right it does not matter what that goal is but there is an esthetic component almost everybody they want to look a certain way or not a certainwy the other ant is functionality i want o be able to perform a certainwy now again that definition differs for persons i want i be better at strength i want to be better at mobility i want to be able to ihave energy throughout th whateverit is there is some sort of appeal to astetic there'e some sort of appeal to functionality with in both those categories we want to be in a position where we can understand where do i need to go with my exercise training that i can be as fit and as healthy an achieve these goals at i want now as well as be ing a position where i can maintain them for a long period of time this blends both immediate goals say youre just interested in squatting a lot awagt say you are interested in running a five ca time the best uent it does not matter it blends that with the abilit thi the desire to have a long wellness span to be fit throughout life to achieve all those things for long as possible that in the question kind comes back to saying how to i know which ary i need a focus on the most and why am i not achieving these guals or how can i get there more factively and if we look at the big picture we have to understand that there are several major components the physical fitness that are going to be required in all of these categories and to achieve that there are handful of components a hafe to happen to be able to hit those gulls now there infinite methods the sayme way actually use here lot is the methods are many but the concepts er few what i love to do to day is over the course of our discussion is hit exactly what those concepts are and then coveral whole bunch of different methods and we coul do that for hours but we will cover a number of them for various sguals one of the reasons i went into neuro science and not into exercise science itis because of this thing nauro plasticity that nervous systems ibility to adapt but the more time i spend with you and the more i learn from you i realize that many if not all of the organ systems of our body have this incredible ability to adapt and when we are talking about physical exercise there are incredible adaptations that of course in bolve the nervous system but also in volve muscle and connective tissue and many other seltypes and tissues that is said when we talk about fitness what are the major types of adaptations that underlie this thing that we call fitness and later i know we are ging to get into how different forms of exercise can trigger different types of adaptations but what are the major adaptations that one can create in their body using exercise there there are many reasons why one should exercise and we could perhaps cover that later in our chats but the physiological adaptations can be bucketed really in a nine areas the very first one is what i call skill or technique jus learning to move better more efficiently wut the specific pecicion and timing and sequend sir whatever that is this could be running more effectivelly this could be practing a skill shooting a a ball or an implement swinging a golf club anything that i call that skill development the second one is speed this simply moving at a higher velocity or with a better rate of acceleration a that is very similar to the nextone which is power and power is speed multiplied by force the next one then of course on top that is force or strength is that those are really synonymous terms right ahow effectively can you move something now this is often confused strength rather as muscular endurance what i mean by that is strength truly is a marker of how what is tho maximum thing you can move or it is maximmount of force you can produce one time its not how many repetitions in a row you can do that is actually another one of our aditations called muscular endurance i right that is typically under the order of say five to twenty five may be fifty repetitions think of a classic how many push ups can you do in a row ow may sit ups can do in a minute tat things that our muscular endurance muscular endurance tends to be localized this is your specific to just say your tricepts in your an your deltoids it is not a over all carty of ascular endurance markor or anyting that thats strength number four number five is musclehypertrophy and this is the first time now we are talking about an appearance rather than a functional outcome you moving better moving fast or moving heavier or indicators of how well you can move this is the first one that o simply how big is your muscle that is musclin perchrier muscle size after that is muscular endurance this is how many repetitions you can typically do of a movement think of how many push up sin a row you can do how many st ups in a minute you can do things that artypically in five to fifty repetition sort of range and it is often or it is almost always local muscle what i mean by that is it is i i push up tesses is really how many raps that your trycepts and packsan in deltoits can do it is not a party of ascular endurance it is not a global physiological endurance is specific totypically one or a few muscle groups at a time this is why you have to do multiple tests for a sort of every group there after that now we have moved into number seven which is what i call anerobic capacity this is more synonymous with maximum heart rat and now ere actually looking at rather than a single movement or muscle group it is a total physiological o limitation it is a the maxim mount of work you can do and say thirty to forty five seconds maybe even up to a hundred an twenty seconds of all out work i think of your classic interval type of stuff here how much work can you do at a maximum rate where you can enter tremendous amounts of global fatigue the nex past that is maximularobic capacity and this is probably ty something in the eight o fifteen minute rain were you are going to reach probably both a maximum heartrate as well as a true vio two max which will will talk a lot more about what that is o later that is is a different from the previous one where you cannot reach this in a matter of secondts it simply takes multiple minutes to get to a position to were your viel two maxis actually going to be a sufficiently challenged are indicated the then i'll ast one number nine is what a colong duration and this is just yourability to sustain some maximal work for a long period time with no breaks no reduction whatsoever this is often called steady state training or lot of people to think of this when think of what uncle cardio but your ability to continue move and without any breaks or change or drop is the last in final adaptation and for long distant steady state i'm guessing it exceeds fifteen minutes because a met a the previous one was at eight to fifteen minutes or what sort of us reat time ranges are we talking about in terms of this a long duration will that is lictualy one ifor you can be anything past fifteen mnutes really if you look at a a count of a mintimal number theres generally twenty minutes of what we are looking for but a a more typical would be twenty to sixtey minutes but anything pass thi would still be limited by your long duration anddurants seerabilitye to sustain work over time o case yore iven that thereare nine different major adaptations that can be induced with exercise of specific types is there any one global test or sessiment that people can take or do that a lows them to determine what level of ability of fitness they have in each an every one of these nine different categories there are probably dozn or more tests that you can do for each one of those nine categories and what would actually to do is walk you through my favorites for eat and giving you both the scientific gold standards if you had the ability i limito resources what should you go do as well as some thatar are equipment free that are cost free things that any one can do across the world in addition to that i wat a walk you through what those numbers should be how d o identify if you really pour in something or if your great and then if you are not as good may be in a category you want to get better at it exactly what to do in terms of protocauls a for how i chievoptim results in each of those seps i notice in your list of the nine different adaptations to exercise that you did not mention fat loss or health promoting benefits which are two reasons that a lot of people ex ercise was there specific reason that you did not mention those absolutely its because those things are actually not specific training styles they are by products of these nine what i mean by that is if you understand how fat loss occurs which we can ternly talk about you will realize some of these nine protocolls are effective for fat loss os some are not ageneral health is the same thing when we understand what it actually means to be healthy from a physiological perspective then the rationow for what to train for is going to determinateself what i mean is looking at things in order to be healthy you have to have sufficient strength you have to have cartyof vasker fitness wye have to have sufficient muscle and et cetera therefore training for one's health is determined by those restrictions for you andrew you may need to do more strength training to be healthy where me because i'm strong already way stronger than you i may not need to do as my strength training our cotuncle health based protocos are based on our current status or limitations and physical fitness among these nine areas what i would to do to day is to cover a brief history of exercise science and the reason is it is going to explain a want about why people are not getting the goals in their exercised programs that they wnt as well as gives you very specific direction about what to do instead i cannot wait to hear all the things that i'm doing incorrectly and have you help me remedy that before we begin i'd emphasized at this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is also separate from doctor galpan's teaching and research rolls at cal state follicton it is however part of our desire and effort to brings erocostic consumer information about science and sized related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme wed to thank the sponsors of todays podcast our first sponsor is mormentus momentous make supplements of the absolute highest quality the huberman lab podcast is proud to be partnering with formentus for several important reasons first of all as i mention theire supplements are of extremely high quality second of all their supplements are generally in single ingredient formulations if you are going to develop a supplementation protocall you are going to want to focus mainly on using single ingredient formulations with single ingredient formulations you can devise the most logical and effective and cost effective supplementation regiment for your goals in addition momentous supplement ship internationally and this is of course important because we realize that many of the huberman lapodcast listeners reside outside the united states if you to try the various supplements mentiond on the hubermanladpodcast in particular supplements for formon health for sleep opplemization for focus as well as a number of other things including exercise recovery you can go to livemomentous spelled o u est that livmomentous dotcom slash hubermen to day's episode is also brought to us by element element is an electurolike drink that contains the exact ratios of the electrolite sodium magnesum an potassium to optimiz seller functioning for mental and physical performance most people realiz is that hidration is key we need to injest in ou fluids in order to feel our best and perform our best but what most people do not realize is that the proper functioning of our selves and nerve cells nuroms in particular requires that sodium magnesium and potassium be present in the correct ratios now of course people with prehi pretension and hih peretension need to be careful about their sodiumen take but what a lot of people do not realize is that if you drink caffene if you exercise nd in particular if your falling of very clean diet that is not a lot of process foods which of course is a good thing chances are you are not getting enough sodium potassium and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance element contains a science packe ratio

brought to us by eight sleep eight sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity i've ben using an eight sleep mattress cover for about the last eight months and it has completely transformed my sleep i'm sleeping about the same amount but i'm sleeping far deeper and i'm now getting the proper ratios of called rapid i movent or rem sleep and slow wave sleep and waking up feeling far more recovered mentally and physically the underlying mechanism for all that is very straight forward i've talked many times before on this pod cast and elsewhere about the critical relationship between sleep and body temperature that is in order to fall asleep at night your body needs o drop by about one to three degrees in terms of coor body temperature and waking up involves a one to three degree increese and cuor body temperature with eight sleep mattress covers you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment to be one temperature at the star of the night a different temperature the middle the night and a different temperature as you approach morning each of which can place you into the optimal stages of sleep and have you waking oup feeling more refreshed than ever if youd to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep do cam slash hubermen and check out their pod three cover and save a hundred a fifty dollars at checkout eight sleep currently

the history of exercise science in forms the mistakes that we are all making and how to remedy those mistakes i'm curious as to whether not you have any favorite one or two studies that point to a sort of naturally accurring a example of how people can become very fit in one aria and not another in i'm familiar with seeing endurance athletes that apapparently have terrific endurance but at least to my eye do not look they are particularly strong i'm also familiar with seeing individuals that are very very strong ptoglar n social media but that do not look they could walk up i light of stairs much less run a mile you have any examples of studies in or outside the laboratory that point to that in a concrete way there is a lot to hap to discuss here but i'll answer really clear aif you look across the literature an this is actually back to as early as the mid nineteen fifties in fact that actually goes back to previous to that to the harvard fatiglab nineteen twenty seven to nineteen forty seven area people actually were advocating at that point a combination of strength training an andurance in then nnting twen way back than e fact acto goes prior that day lay eighteen eighties there is scientific evidence back that ike became more well developed in the midnineteen fifties an sixties in fact there was the initial stages of what is called the exercises medicine movement which is the movement now but the initial stages of that actually route back to the nineteen fifties and i old actualy go ing that whole discussion in t story of how that all came about but that is the health ess wealth a montra that came from the nineteen fifties from the scientific commuity thet all those those data points are going to suggest you need a combination of some sort of broad strength training and broad endurance now if you have a specific goal five months from now we want a compete in a ras ure h a certain physique think that is fine to focus on one area training certainly yere an athlege that is different but if you want a maxim mise health tand and over all functionality throughout time and east be accombination and are really really highlike this likecan actualy talk about a couple of studies that i've done i'm one of whem we actually did in stockhome sweden i did this at the carolansk institute which you probably are aware of m it is actually one of the founding places of all of exercise physiology a generaly it started there it was called something different back then but areally our entire field came out of stockhome in the carlans institute and we work with the whole bunch of cross country skeers that we are in their eighties and nineties and they were competitive skears the nineteen forties and fifties and they had been skeming competitively for that entire durations you are talking fifty to sixty consecutive years of competing se theres are eighty to ninety year olds living alone and healthy and we compared them to a group of individuals a here in america who are the same age but we are not exercising and what we wanted to do is to say an can look out what of these lifelong endurance individuals whate they look when we brought them in the lab which is by the way amazing to do a veal to maccest on a ninety two year old a especially in language that they do not speak you are in a you can imagine you are doing this in the hospital right and you are running people through this is a cycling tesk and for a veal to maccess you have a mask on your face you hooked up to a metabolic carts we can collect all the gases that are coming at your mouth and youre you are chanting these people on and basily every minute the work load gets harder and hard and harder untill you camp completeid and we are doing this in in a carteology senter and the cardyologist are usually waiting for the hart rate to get slightly elevated than they stop them cause there eighty five eighty six years old and nonly we not stopping them but we are screaming in their esis lacogogo and sweetes surin ai in english right and hen that the translater with it does not take a lot of translation when seven screaming at your face gogogo we ran them through whole mentor view to max tas we did the same thing for those folks back a here ar in america and what was a incredibly clear from that study was the viel to max a you can think about these numbers n nesses was caled relative in the relative terms are a middl leader's per kilegram permitet and we standard number is about eighteen is we call the line of independence if youreviel two max is below eighteen middle laters percilegramperment is very hard for you to live by yourself you'r fitness is low you probably a oing to have somebody living with you or you will need to be in some sort of assisted living hom if you are in viel two max of twenty yor twenty one or twenty two you are not below that line of independence but you are on that threshold and we found was our folks here in america the group average was right around that number they were living at home by definition we pick them to be people living by themselves in their eighties not in t living but they did not have any band with if they got a cold or they had anything pop up where they lost a little bit of fitness they were a drop below that line and would probably have to go to some sertice as o living situation the folks in stockhom the the cross country skeers the group average was most closer thirty five to thirty eight mill laderspikilegram permitted now that number is about the viel two max you would find for a normal college mail and these folks that were literally eighty or ninety if the nof the joke if a saber two tiger ran in the room or r whatever an it chase it down and we all had to run to see who did notget eaten alive that the college men would probably've got n eaten before the the ninety year olds in in one case we had a ninety two year old individual di think his viel to max was thirty eight which was an our estimation worold record the highest fiel to max for somebode over the age of ninety me ask what is the typical resting heart rate for somebody a very fit these a older sweedish cross country skears theyyou have somebody has a am this let say their number is thirty five milliers for kilegram in this a viel two max test but since most of must do not have access yet that kind of equipment but the we cannot measure our pulsrate ye what was a typical resting heartrate resting pulsory sub sixty sye im typically that is a good number to go off for anybody regardless of age any time i see somebody above that o i'm constern't asking questions scertainly above now you'l seein the literature people will say sixty to eighty is normal on i i do not agee thoat at all if you are up if you'r resting hartrid is seventy five beaust for menat there is either something going on or you are not fit how much cross country scheme were they doing on average in the previous mult say if we take the previous twenty years since they would been long come cross country scears divide that by twenty years yet on everagar of these people cross country scheme five hours a ay two hours day an hour or de yet that is actually god question i do not remember it is been many years i but they were not doing it every single day and the volume would not of shocked you it was the consistency over fifty years tha got them there now ib see these people were again world champions and lumpic old metalis ind nineteen forties and fifties they were ye leat they just continued consistently over time but it was not a shocking amount of physical fitness they also did not gody their way to train hard they were busy chopping would they were busy doing number of other things and then they just happened to do some ofthese races and ski a long way but it was not a crazy amount to where you'r all that is great but i can never hit that number yit was something much more reasonable is the take away to be consistent about getting carty ascular exercise and we can define yet what consistent means in terms of days per week lo bit later i know we will what er some other examples i love these examples of a from the real world here here is the downside though i only told you about their vial to macs what i did not tell you about is ther strength and functionality and that part was no more superior than it was thei'r counter parts who were not exercisers what that showed really really clearly and many other studies have been done since then that look at the class it al we call life long endurance exercisers you will see in general thei'r veal to macts ther carty of ascer function they are resting hart rate they are blood pressure it will be a markedly healthier then folks yo do not exercise it is extraordinarily clear that type of exercise is very important for chronicto tese management no dout about it however it is not sufficient for over all globl health because it does almost nothing for legs strength for any other marker of health which we can talk about what are the things iner actur going to predict martality im or bebitye the most that was a a big a big smashing indication that is a caye this is great however you are leaving things on the table for you'r over all health not one could argue they are eighty and tathey are doing pretty well but they were not doing as well in these areas and a study we did later actually as o follow up was looking at monoslike us twents this is actally interesting being he scientists his is a classic example of one of my gradual students who would been i my lab for probably three or four years and she was in our single fibre physiology lab and shes you imagine she is n she is isolating individual muscle fibers from an athlete one by one with the tweezer and she is going to do several thousand individual cells i say she is you are down there for hours and an things happened own there you cann't lose your mind aand choose kind of going on one day with one of my collegues just talking and shes o ya my uncle is realy really fit and something or other and then oh yet he is a twin andis os ye monosigas sind she is yet for those that are no mnasgs ir identical twin yet what is is interesting you basely have when i'm setting up hereas is this the perfect exercise scientific experiment monofs likeus identical twin to mean the they have exact same toane an egg was fertilize split and then two humans threwg out of that with the exact same deane and now we can ster n ance or the questionawhle yekee what about maybe these cross country skeeers maybe they were just gunetic freeks maybe it did not matter its some people have wu jen exere always a coponent to it but how much well now we have a sanarea lining oup wherds si uidama you have monos us twin we ave a replica of a human being exact same dean e the only differenceis we would see in their physiology now would be due to life sal circumstances interesting monos us twan un a it dout an uncle right unh great do they exercise we one of em does he is the life long endurance exercise runner psyclist swimmer iron man all these things what about the other one no he does not exercise at all at at that point i wanted to kill my graduate sudent cause i'm you have been in my lab for three years or more probably and you have never told me that in your household is the perfect scientific experiment for exrcise you could ever create i tes is the the the look on her face when my calling an i wes staring ato sucychall my god i'm call them right now theyre coming in the lab of fly them in from chicago outont care what we have to do we are gettin im in and i wanted to actually going back to the model that was first developed by the harbor fatiglad one thing that is interesting about that committeeis they started off with the consctept of trying to examine human per formance through a wholistic lens and it was the antithesis of looking at a either organ by organ we are going to only look out the carty ofvescer system or only going to look out skelen o muscle and then we are saing we are looking at this entire picture and that model we wanted to carry through when these twins an i tait are right im want to bring them in the lab but i'm not just going to look out one system i want to do everything we took stool samples we took blood we did vertical jump test we did maximum strength test we did a am orise of muscle mass we did i a veal to max test we di deficiencies of we we dejnec testang we danicue test wed psychological battery we want to look at everything to figure out all these things whald differe between the twins and if the second kee question there is by how much can i improve my veal to mac sure every one knows that but how much can' it change by five percent eighty per cent where is the number and putting some quatification on this was very important and again we had another example of a classic endurance only training paradime compared to a a non cso this is a a person wis enas a truck driver by vocation which is i thin gactualle drove for a potatoship company which was even funnier the the endurance actlly actually was grat because any endurance people he had a he had physical books of all his training malege for the last thirty five years and we could we was went through them we calculated the total amount o miles he ran his averages his hart race per e time we had this unbelievable thing what races he was in at the documentation ou was is totally notstright something that indurance people are shakin their head right out gon o ye i got that to ananduranc spokes are pretty nurrty yes y right as great because ow i could validy it as close as one could to actually how much he ran anthings that they ad about a thirty five year discord they both exercised up through high school about eighteen they stopped doing it by the time te run in the lavther in their mid fifty is about thirty five years at diference and when we ran them through the testing if you look at the the measures that were similar to the sweden study it was almost identical the evthe exerciseing twin was significantly better at things a lipid panel resting hartright blood pressure reveal to mags any of those markers i ask predicted were er much better what was very interesting though was the things that were in the middle first of all their total mont a muscle mass was almost identical to the gram with in the margin of air of a dexo scamp could possibly ever be the non exerciseer though was a little bit fatter the difference in actual body weight was explained almost entirely by body fat ar non lean tissue really same surdo okan no one surprised there that the exercisor was a little bit leaner even knou it did not change toleamoun a muscle mass at all when we looked at some of the more functional tests nd we looked at things muscle quality this is ametric you can get from an ultra sound youdn kind of think about this as how much fat is inside the tissue which is some times in advantage for enduran sactly to have a little but morefin what are caled inture musclar trie cla sorise because it is a fuel directly ng the tissue but in general the exercise are the a the muscle quality was not in favor of the exerciser if you looked at the performance testing and if you looked at strength it favored them the non exerciser now again we have the same finding we saw in our sweden study but in identical twins and it really really tigh lighted the fact that if you want to move forward with optimo health simply picking one si lo is not going to get yue there what is all te meating just running just likeing right does this mean that the twin that did not exercise could jump hire or win in arm reslin a competition not that that is a vital thing to be able to do wich just in terms of measuring strength as our icometric strength awas the not exercising twin stronger o at least as strong as their exercise in yes perticulary ingrip strength yet and any the measures the vertical jump extension power in a number of things they often favored the non exerciser which you are still a little bit of a chicken and eg you do not know of necessarily the endurance training reduced that other twins strangth or it does not even really matter per say i think the highlight of it is can you change some of these metrics of val to maxia not even close these things are v ary responseiv regardless of youre genetic you'r genetics will give you a starting place very clearly meven the non exerciseer was a pretty healthy got they were'to godspot admid fifties does not exercise does not realpay attention is died at all and he was in prega shat however if you want to actually move progress and move ford a high functionality you have to do something besides just run rigt just distance run now i could say the samething for strengtring that alone ax i do not want to make the sing i'm saying underencs exercises it worked an both case both thy studies those folks were much better off in mactrics that are incredibly important to mortality how long you aregoing to live veal two macs t cetr it is just not going to get there inters a strank we took a look at muscle fibre physiology is well which is very interesting what i mean is there is generally two types of muscle fibres fast twitch an slow twitch and one on things it is a hall mark of agane is a reselective reduction in fast witch fibres and tht's because it is difficult to activate them unles you are oing hige orse activities you are ant actove et slow twitch fibres doing almost any activity of daily living and they stay around fast wich fibres unless you are doing something of hig force or going not be used an not going to be kept around and that is a problem because when you look at things the need for strength throughaging the ability to catch yourself from a fall these things are incredibly importanif you do not have fastat fibres you do not have the speed to get your foot out in front of you on time and you dofthave the ecentric strength the stop the fall from happening and if you look acrossing in the aging literature that they are very clear about the importance of maintaining strangth an and fast with fibrs overtime we kow that this is an important distinction here of roll and people will often talk about o k how much of that ais genetically determine can i change my fibr type and the answer theirs is resoundingly yes and can i change it with exercise an the answers absolutely you can and the next question is how much now again rganisseem order of magnitude in general without going too far down a an area maybe begay for for later each one of your muscles in your body has a different percentage a fast witch an slo twitch for example youre calf if you look at your soliest which is a kind of he smaller one echoes in the back that is generally mostly slow twitch typically eighty per cent or slow twitch the gastroch which is the other one right next toits if you are to point your toe next your face in that part that cot a flux is out in the middle pops out that is your gastrock that is almost the invers it is generally eighty per cent fast witch may be twenty per some slo twitch mgenerally anything anti postural or postural rather anti gravity a spinal erectors things hat ar met to keep you up or moving all day are gong to be slow twitch and things your hand strings which prefer explosion ary and be fast witch we buy upso the cuad in these individuals and in that muscle it is generally about fifty fifty fast witch slowkdwitch as it is a really broad number well what other things t we found was in the non exerciser it was almost tax book what you ould predict it was about fifty percent or slow twitch a little bit of percentage of fast witch an a about twenty per cent of one of these called hibrid fibers which are a hall mark of activity ir gregt in the exerciser it was about ninety five per cents slotwitch and it is extremely clear again i do not know if may be their set point was lowed hirer towards that in the non exerciser do devolve down to his place or they he one but it does not matter i mean going from forty per cent t which in one case to ninety five percent solitritch in another case it shows you that the the limits of physiological adaptation our darn near boundless given enough exposure an this case thirty five years of extremely consistent training and his muscle morphology was completely different than his identical twin of the exact same daina those are two beautiful examples of people doing endurance work for a number of years and what that gives them in terms of benefits and functionality as the opposite experiment been done or observed where somebody just weight lifted or just sprinted for a number of years i i do not know that there is a identical twin a control that no i wish betta third t an to too much tas o right triplets o case o triplets out there om e fou're exercising in different ways were people have triplets maybe you assignd one kid to be a runner when iv ye a weight lifter and the other one to be sedintary please do not do experiments that but the expectation as i understand it would be that the person that sprince oere to that does heavy squats explosive work would then have more fast witch muscle fibres in their quad and they are non exercising counterpart wu'ld have fewer that that would make cens but what happens if you ascise the the endurance lavel in somebody who is just done string training or just sprinted yet we do not have those data specifically there is word actually just starting to have studies come out on life long strength tranners and there is litery very good reason for this i which is a whole story we can get into but the the quick answer is we do not have a lot of people who have been lifting waits for thirty r plus yers we have a whole swath of people whoave been doing in durns training for that long is that because fewer people have been weig training or the wei trainers all dead you gout go back to the nineteen fifty three nineten fifty for yet two major things happen the change the entire course of exercise physiology and exrcisescience and really exercises we know it it is important to understand the history of our feel a lot of the questions i get are based on false assumptions of what exercise can and cannot do as an example we a questions momentom should i use momenta ar that is cheating right or it does not work i it compromises my results it is actually totaly untrue there are excellent reasons when you should use momento when you left there are reasons when you should not it is sometimes very beneficial to go fast with the exercised repetition sometimes very slow an patrol this better any question i get in fact i'm very infamous for always responding with it depends the reason i say it depends is it depends on the goald when you are training for speed or power musclar endurance the answer to some of these very common question differs what people fail to realize is they think they are asking the right question because they do not understand this history what is been planted in your brain subconsciously is driving that question it is not necessarily the right one if we walk through that a little bit you will see what that field has led you why you think certain things matter when they actually do not or maybe your assumptions arenin correct and then exactly what to do about them i to see a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor athletic greens ith letic greens is a vitemin mineral probiotic and adapteg in drink desin to help you meet all of your foundation or nutricional needs i've been taking athleti greens daily since two thousand and twelve i'm delighted that their responsor of this podcast reason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take outhletic greens once or twice to day is that it helps me meet all o my foundation or nutricional needs that is it covers my vitemens my minerals and the probiotics are aspecially important to me ith letic reens also contains adaptogins which are critical for recovering from stress from exercise from work or just general life if you to try it letic greens you can go to tleti greenstock calm slash hubermen to claim a special offer they'l give you five free travel backs and they will give you year supply of vithim in dee three cay to again if you to try it letic grens go to thletic greenstock calm slash hubermen to claim the special offer in nineteen fifty three nineteen fifty four you had roger banister breaking the four minute mile subtorment file and they also had sir edman hilery and an his trip an norgay a summon everist in the same bisca to your spand that exact same year after that was a formation of what is called the american college of sports medicine now that is still around to day it is the pre eminent group for this exercises medicine if you are interested in things exercise for obisity prevention for cancer treatmen for for things that is not really sports medicine it is more for a clinical exercise that is the place to go mericacolege sporse medicin we have this launching of both a ton of people wanting to start doing endurance exercises start swimming and cycling and running thnd you have a launch of people coming off of the back of the harbor fatigue lab the fatigue lab actually shut down on nineteen forty seven you have these people interested in physical fitness but nowhere to go well all those people left the harverteaglapan start of their own labs another places you have launch the careers of people a they have costul and n an johnhalase an someof these very famous exercise physiologists and they start bill ing laboratories and we start for the first time ever studying thi science of exorcise years go by and these people happen nineteen sixys and nineteen seventies when we call the runners bone people start that if you fact if you look at the numbers of people who are doing marithons it explods through these two deckates spance right because it is implike them we culd do these en durance feas notice both those feats wor endurance right running short term as well as going over there no one has thought anything about strength training and here is why in the late eighteen eighties there was a very famous a physicion and a george winship i think was his nan who is a big proponet iv strength training well he died lke in the age of fifty something of a hardittack and that terrified people of strength training for seventy years becaue theyre wooo thats suff we will kill you as he was a doctor he was crying his running around the country doing thise exhibitions and proporting it and then he died thi sort atgins hundrer per cent dying all the some people said he died of a harder tak of the people said he fell through the ice into cold water tit is debated but the fact that a e hevery proponent iv the a nuw tircian plan dies suddenly yet not good for business now the little storm is brewing nineteen forties and i'm going back a little bit but bear with me for a secon there is a guy name a peter carbrvitge and he is aa a scientists out of springfild the decorated physical education p that ghat's a legenary place springbook college and he is anti strength traing for a lot of same reasons and is not our career talked about note do this he is one that lounch these ideas hat strength training will make you those flexibility it will be bad for kids all these things that we know now are clearly not true he is proponer o these things and there is a show that happened i'min his a springfulo college and a guinane bob york and if you wyork barbell thats still around to day he is going around the country and in putting on his exhibitions they come to spring filld an ti sort of a a new aged a chim eou thing wheres the students know it is about to happen thes carprvitt shows up to this event and everyone knows he hates strangth training and everyone is waiting for t to end just to see what he is gon a say this whole exhibition goes on these people are doing not be gettin rebeck the time body building way lifting power lifting strang strong men it is all the same thing there is no differintiation yetand it finishes and carprovitte stands up and the crowd goes silent and he just asks one question he us points to on of the guisan says scratch your back and now he just assuming and waitingfor the guid to be ah and not be able to put his hand behind a sad nd i think he pointed to john gammi cusak o famous body builter and he reaches back and scratches back no proble and then they proceeded to grab two dunbells i thnk there were fifty pound dunbills into a backflip standing back with both any chanc they start doing the splits on sage thy start going performing all kinds of physical function tes and an carprovitts is stunned he is lik wholly she has nothing to say he leaves there an his hole life is changed all these things he was claiming were shwn in his face to be false he does a one ady on his career he starts running study after study on strength training and starts finding immediately there are no detriments to strength traing in trums of lake lobal health right of course you can do it wrong and things that in fact here comes a whole bunch tof benefits through nineteen fifties while this thing's going on with the endurance folks no one still strength training because there is no there is no record to see there is no american call just ports medicine there is no societies there is no science or not sureo safe and meanwhile carvvitch is is hammering study after study after study showing you it is safe and safe an safe but it has not picked up yet and then everything changed in nineteen seventy seven thank youarnald sortznegger he came out with the trifled he hits you with pumping iron which i know you now that mo be right pumping interesting mov even for those not interested in body building it is a very interesting movi because it really gives te window in to not just him but the way in which way training started to show up as a regular practice you knay when i was growing up the only people waytrain were people preparing for foball body buillers who basidin't exist in the town where i grew up and the only people did yoga we are yogie's doing bickrub but now you drive through any major american city or your pincity and theres yogus studios there is jim with freewats if arnold shortznger is largely responsible i think for it for initiating that that shift yet he cause he d think about it he hit us with pumping iron conan and in the terminator almost in back the back very close within yoars you have got this whole cascade the seventies of people running cycling is swimming now science o sartin to come out that it is not dangerous and may be actually some benefit and then boe not allays hat imnot bad for you it can make you into a real world super hero we think about the psychology of of a child groing up watching somebody conan think about what bat man looked inthe nineteen fifty o sixty's right and then bon i can look that now not everyone wants to look arnal but you see t if you see the power that can landin people no one had ever seen or thought you can make your body transformed that you could maybe be born that but no chance that is within the grass of all of you when i was a kid growing up one of my favorite books was the ginnis bookaworld's records yet i still have it images in my mind of the the a coldest animal thetur the longest lies band et cetera or him and there was a picturein there of arnld shortsnegger and you kno it his record was is said perfectly developed man yeeye which is as you point out that is not the physique that must people us pir att but it really i it did inspire this the ship the other thing about resistance straining that i think a has a certain allure for some people men and women is that it is one of the few forms of exercise that because of the enhanced he blood flowed to the muscle that occurs during the training the called pump yet it gives you a transient but somewhat real window into what youre results will be hor you on to run and your gasping for er you do not get the you are not experiencing what it is to be faster than you are that day at's r but when you wait train you get and esthetic picture into how your functionality an esthetic will change it disappears a few hours later sor as the the call pumps of subsises but it is a very an interesting form of exercise in that way it is almost as if you go into learn a language and during the process of learning for brief moments you are actually fluent and then a gt taken away yet its what puts the dopomen carret out in front of you yet this is just me hypothesising as to why waight training might have a taken off the way thetyt an mi's if you got paid every hour on the hour we you are working in the tt thing of the day thy take the money back but you still as the time clock is going on your day you are looking up you tot seeng why you are watching your bank account grow in real life you can see why it is addicting to those folks to finish the story he're what going back your actual question answer this is happening the late seventies early eighties and now jo weader all these gems they are exploding because people want a look that or if they hade they realize that have the chance to change how they physically look that had never been a reality before you easiatly men at that point i'm almost yes ilucively yet for a large number of reasons cultural exceptance et cetera even within durance stuff you coal get fitter and run faster n that is better but i gesn was not going to change how you looked unless you were losing fat now you can change how you look which is incredibly dicting factors of a very famous quok i think it is a goweader who said show me one man who wants to be strong and 'll show you ten a an a lookstrong rights that is very very powerful right this is a whole the hlt dis ton o this history in't going to with is sort of explaining to but now your the menaties and you have what i call my generation you have my generation who faln love a straing training the eighteen in n nineteen eighty's nineties but there is really no scientific field for it it is not really come about yet the science of endurance and exercise physiology is now humming along in a massive rate because these people came up win the seventies and eighties and there five ten fifteen years in their carer they are producing they are gn it they'r genering gradual students they are starting on labs and the excise physiology still to this dayis eighty per cent endurance steady statestup almost exclusively well now mike my generation you love you love sports you love lifting you alof all these things and now we see hapin is the chicago bulls michael george starts picking up strain train woh that is an that is on tivs on sports in er ndn mid nineteen ninety's lifting waights and we go back actually to the ae nineteen seventies and i'm i'm not sure of your football fan but any footballfanwill recognize then abraska corn huskers ind h nineteen seven eigtyes and eighties change ha foopulse played well the reason it is because they start a straing training and hit strat of doing it with the giname boy et believe who is the founder of the annace the national strength and itioing association is formed in the light nineteen seventies as well just acy and was developed the year after those two events happened nineteen seventy eight the year after ortol comes out bome anda sea is formed and now you have a scientific organization dedicated distrain thin addition you have got and a fell strength inishoning coaches that are starting to come on board you have got scientists that are starting to come and elapse and strength iditiony becames to scientific field well every thing swings now from an exercise perspective into body buildingand almost all the things in fact we were sort of talking before i could run a whole bunch of tricks on you and i could ask you a whole bunch of questions about things you think are absolute standards are guaranteeds about training i'm supposed to do this i'm never supposed to do that for instance i for instance is it ol cay to train a muscle group on back to back days most people are at home thinking no you are not supposed to train a musclenees to recovery and that is total nonsense rigt i'm other things body part split training riht training one muscle group per day im other things cardio endurance training influencing will it ruin my gains for my lift all these things are on at a a base of assumptions that come from body buildingnow that is a fantastic worl but because everything started in the eight nineteen seventies as body building s turns a basica strength training was that waight lifting an power lifting were not at all around right they were but nobody cared again show me somebone who wants to be strong i'll show you ten a on a lookstron the physique thing just dominated and we are we are not getting out of that yet i were not alvoy out of it we are starting to them because here is why people strar to realize this this body building ding is fantastic i can change my physique i'm getting better but damn these work outs take an hour anda half two hours andi'm an a spend that whole time on one or two body parts which meas i'm going to half to lift six days a week and i'm n after that consistently right now ill send bom two hours on my on my elbow flecters damn my elbowstrtnto hurt and yet my understanding is that it does not really require two hours to day not at all training in order to get benefits even just for hypertrophy totally but but a a lot of time you gen to have to get some amount of time in because you are spending much isolation we have gone away from training movement running is a movement cycling is a movement i'm training my byseps is a muscle ar bot muscle group i'm training my hand strings are a muscle group it is not a human movement we have done a one eighty in terms of select in the exercises from movement base prescription two now muscle group base training sowhen your icoating muscle groups that means a whole trunk of your body is really not doing much throughout the day what happens if your doing say legs on monday and you miss my naka jron a flight now your legs have to wait a whole nother week raet's the sucion thatbit this dust become problematic people's or are getting beat ups people start realizing i can not feel that great i'm not superfit i'm sweating just walking up the stairs i'm out of breath why because all that training you have done nothing for your carty of ascir fitness you have done nothing to improve i'm heartraight oxygenation bloodflow and that parodiam swaing way too hard into the exercising especially lifting weights is single joint often machine often slow often high volume isolation and that left a gint opening of people going await a minute what if you coul get into gem i could promise you the same or better results and under thirty minutes and i fact you also feel better you will lose more weight and that opened up group exercise classes kettlebell stuff cross fit type of soff circuit training because you can come in you will not get beat up cas the volumes lower the time is much lower you get moltipule adaptation at the same time great the problem with that though fast for ten years is it started burying people because you have now d emphicize movement quality and you have over empecise scores right this is a classic example if you go anyou watch pumping iron you will see ore anybody bi you will see if they are doing a by sepcro they do not even really pay attention to the rep range they do not really pay ten to th load they are looking at their muscle ere trying to figure out how do i get that thing to fire they are squeezing teire flex ing their posing at the end of every set there trn figur out om mi gettng enough pomp it is exclusively founded on exercise quality the rep range the numbers almost a relofit when you go the other model exercise technique it does not matter just get the most amont of weight up or them mount of raps or the fastest time et cetera cetera high be the cros fit i've walk passom cross fits yuse have done too cross that 'll o is you said crossfat i did not oh i on't know i i enjoyed the i defily i felt iawas working hard i oh you i observed a lot of people in very close proximity umdoing olympic lifts and doing kipping that is where you kicky legs folks you no sort bucking and and kipping tight pull ups a no i i enjoyed it a it was notfor me for the long term but it did seem that there was a a lot of bollistic movement in gose proximity to other people an the hazard to me seem more about that than the actual movements well again tha the point of setting up here is that was actually a really brilliant solution for a lot of problems the classic body bilding hyperchfy introduced i' got away from isolation movements and got people doing big movements which are more effective generally better i got people doing things fast and explosive that is more athletic that is more important for longevity it solved a lot of the problems joint health was not etting crashed the issue they went with is they just pushed the pace on score rather than quality they push the pace on how many people can be in here t the same time now you are doing highe risk movements higher intensity higher fatigue and with a total not that they do not care abou technique but it is not the thing that thei'r most concerned about it is getting the number an the thing done they stall the time issue though you can get tremendous results in three days a week under forty five minutes each session et cetera burn people ot though wai too much high intensity weight too often and the other problem safety concerns all kinds of worth o petic issues and other sto can i a interrupt you for momen just ask ya question as we go through this art of the history of why endurance training predominated or strainth training or body building type training or cross fit type training cause i think this is fastening i know where about to arrive at where we are to day an what the future looks for for people in what they should focass on and du at what point if any do you think resistance training started to become adopted my women there was no equivalent of arnold schworts negger there was a linda hamilton an the terminator ye am there ar some impressive a physiques certainly on a female actresses and a athlets the willium sisters very pressive i musculaturen physiques and of course their tensplaying yegs for itself u has that happened yet i mean yet what i mean is a do you think since you workd with both men and women ye do you think that most women understand tat weight training done properly is going to be extremely beneficial for them maybe even especially for them in terms of am offsetting bondensity lost and things of that sort m or we still waiting for the stimua the a popular a stimulus for getting eighty percent of of young women thinking i want e lift waihts yet hart for many ancercas em not i'm not a woman right now i have a daughter shes for salult will see i'm what i can say is is i've probably worked with i do not know how many professionalthins in total a lot i've worked with them probably fourteen perofessional sports a've worked with sa young winners envy pes the whole allall the credentials right i bet thirty five forty percent the le thits have worked with our female i've worked with e limpic old metalists ave worke with a bronze metalis and unmultiple sports ave worke with o the most decorated power lifter of all times in a number of these areaus fighters world championship all these things im from me i feel that verses orea yo hap my students if you look at my class room i i do not nowat the numbers are but there is no small number of females in exercise science and exess physiology im if you look in our laboratories that is one thing you will see there are very few female exercise sciences there are very few a female strained inisionin coaches but that number is is is coming down aa astronomical rat you have a people that are being hired i'm in every sport a you pick the anofal you pick matri baseball every every femonths were hearing first female hired for this first f emale hired for that am the yankees rachel rachel about vis fantastic you not yet yet rachel's been out to my lab she is turrifict yeh ye ye that is that she is fantastic an she is now being hired as ei think she is a hitting coach now actual's work i she she is goin to be a jam t that is this hergol she is a terminator am that that is already happening and my sudent that are coming through our program aure getting place in these rules they have not gott through yet a lot and terms of being an actual scientists but they are getting there am s more scienceis tn beabing hired females and froms big data collections whar science an tack will cover a an an another discussion but i think i's happening whether not the the cultural and social pr i cannot speak to that ant equation what i can' speak to thou is one of things i think is is most fun coming for d scientifically is you knw a number of years ago and i at came backly came through wit their mandates o saing it is no longer acceptable to exclude women frofm scientific research ri as we just did that for that case well what happened i ajust to fill this in cossesting it is worth noting is that for many years am studies even on road ints ye we are mainly carried out on maleroad ins because the a sumption and the assumption turned out to be wrong but the assumption was that the physiology of female rodins because tey do not have a menstrual cycleis not twenty eightdays of an estra cycle its for days ar a different type of cycle that tht would somehow distrupt the data turns out that is entirely wrong now it is actually required a when you sit on ta grant study panel i which the people value he grants you they ask they literally say did they meet the carteria for sec as a biological variable herewere noch about secs as the verb reemas exist a a biological sec and am if you do not say yes that is a strong hit against the grant anyou say yes then it checks off that box it is now required they both male and female roadins and humans be studied an a given study unless the study is specifially geared toward understanding that only exists in one yet on ere the other populatio such as a a metapaus fr e estence yemenstrual cycle a antropaus a for instance but am this is extremely importanti'm excited to hear that am wer warls can to go withthat is actually that wil step one which is cool you got include whet we have not gottn to yet but i've seen more and more grand applications come through for this its just the funning has not yet which is it is one thing to in to let women be in the same studies that is great it is another thing though to star performing high performance research specifically for female questions that has not happened yet that is just a funning issuer we have not gottn money yet people are not are not supporting that we doft get a lot of financial support for sport science but we han't cannot tract on the money yet of something me going i want to do a study in female at thin siencer female athic questions these will not help men these are questions specific to the female that is the next tout right that is where we got to get to we can stic maybe we should do things differently a around training o recovery or or we should not or t does not matter that there is some there is a handful of not lower quality but some studies im i do not love them yet there just needs to be a tinol work o birth controlis a very good example it wthe the information for women at female athletes or even just hard exercisers you i have to be compettered abountly around what is worth control doing what types how should i manage that what conversations should i be having with my doctor almost nothing women have nothing to go on for high performance what if i'm trying to compete in event or or run a rays how all those types of questions should be answered a normano value norman of data i perform us testing i it is just not there on the female that is an arry i i think ti if somebody realy wanted to make a change that the sciencis want to do it i know i've talk to many in our field that would really love to explore it o because it is getting there the theth tik cus sat the coaching side it is getting there their seen that they'r hiring these people i'm seen in in my students im they on my my followings is not all men tit gits very large percentage of females and all i do as most about excize sciencein this all i do will this pard cest is a very we know very clearly the audience o is fifty per cent women fifty per cent men that is rons which is great just to jump back at our history discussion and to finish that point o where r at now an where i think we are going to go or should go we walk through the body building count of running everything and people walking into a gim any time they lift awaights ther ther making all their choices based in the assumption that maximizing muscle size is the goll and clearly that is not the case er other adaptations you may be after we talked about how that had problems than we talked about how somebotyese other forms of exercise filled those gaps and then what problems those things introduce well i think we are actually at a spoint were tht pendulum is kind of slowly shifting into the middle what i mean by that is if you want to maximis muscle strength we look towards the power lifting community you want to maximias muscle power orit look the waylifting community we want to look for muscular endurance r well rotenis maybe we look in the crossit communities and somebodyes obstcal course races or functionalitything what we can do now its generate protocals that get us the exact adaptations we want and not ones we do not want because we can look back at each of these different styles of training and pick and chese optimle protocals or combinations for them somebody is simply wants to get healthy we talked about when we listed the nine adaptations and i mentioned health was not one of them that is because what determines your health verse is what determines my oftomy health differs if i need more hypertrophe i can look towards body building concepts but if i have enough or maybe for personal reasons i decide i have too much ri do not want to add any more then i can say eiht how can i get stronger without getting bigger and bore my look tords pirlifting concepts how can i get more powerful how can i get faster but i do not ta now again want to lose fat o gagrey or if i want physique changes we have all these different areas we can pick and choose from that have experatese in specific adaptations and develop ourselves perfect protocalls a based on that information i'd to take a brief break to acknowledge our sponser inside tracker inside trackers a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood endian e to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals i've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason than many of the factors that impact your immediate and long turm health and well being can only be analyzed from a quality blood tests one issue with a lot of blood testantyanatus out there however is that you get information back about verious levels of lippids and hormones an metabolic factors et cetera but you do not know what to do with that information inside tracker makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy they have a personalized platform that lets you see what your sipis ic numbers are of course but then also what sorts of behaviour old dues and donts what sorts of nutrisional changes what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimol for you if youd to try inside tracker you can visit inside tracker dot calm slash hubermen to get twenty per sent off any of inside trackers plans again that is inside tracker dot calm slash hubermen to get twenty per cent off with the understanding in mine as to how we all myself included arrived it such lopsided fitness too much endurance not enough strength too much strength not enough endurance at's really hard to imagine any one's perfect in this regard can you walk us through the nine different adaptations that you mentioned earlier and give us away to a sess our level of ability or our level of adaptation in each of those nine are it the very first one we want to talk about is is movement skill now set aside sport specific o i'm not goingogiveoug a sessiment for optibal golf technique swing is is really about human movements to th you stay injury free and you can continue to train for as long as possible woar o the minimerequirements now if you can have access a highly qualified physical therapist or movement specialist that is the best rout right go to them have them identify all of your movement patterns overhead press ing squatting running all these things that is your gold standard if you want to do it yourself though hereis aa very simple foretupsolution the way that i it teach us is go joint by joint and i i think of this jus as the major ones your shoulder your elbow your low back hip knee and ankle now what you can do is do a representative movement for you if you benture lot use the baut if you do pull ups youse su pull up if you squat do that i would recommend doing an upper body press an opper body pull a lower body press lower body pull an example would be a push up a pull up or a bent row a squat an then a deadlift now would be a very very well r ounded approach what you are going to do is do that movement and iwould record it tfor yourself and in record affront of you and a side vieu i prob'bly do three the ten repetitions pur angle ok slow in control you do not need me bodywayht what you want to do is move and you want o look for four key things at every joint it i again imagine of doing a squat i'm in tor do a squat a'm in a focus on just my ankle an'm a look for these four things of the ankle and then an i'm n to go back and watch my knee and look for these same four things the nee to the hip et cetera riht where these for things number one as you want to look for symmetry symmetry is front to back left or right and a your right limb in your left lim and we we want to look for or and if they are not moving perfectly that is fine but you want to see is one moving further ahead than the other one is one a turning to the side one's nt is one fidgeting in and twitching around differntly you want to look just o check to see and make sure that their stable that is one i'm number two you want look for stubility key indicators here are things if you if you cannot contrue a a squat a controlled squat where your knees do not start shaking i that would be an instability issue can you do the movement slow can you posit the bat a may be three seconds may be five seconds or ten you should have complete control of that movement at all of these joints i'm are your hip slidinto ones side when you stand up is one elbow closer to your body when you are benching an th other one's more flared out these ar the things i'm talking about right i'm not worried about what angle they should be at or not you are simply looking for a symmetries or instabilities re u again as you are pushing up toes one elbow start flipping and twitching and going all of the place the third one is what i call awareness a there are lot of movement technique issues that are simply people do not know and you will watch them squat i do this on my classes all the time i'll have a hundred kiss out their squatting and you will ee some horrible squat technique and when you just tell them ay did you realize your heels are supposed to be on the ground all times in you squat oh and they can correct it is not actually movement flot it was just simply an awareness i did not know and then i actually did not realize that that was happening that positionso we want all of our joints to be going through a general ful range of motion which is number for the ankles a doring a squat your knee should beable to go far over your tosts possible whill maintaining good position your feet flat on the floor your youn three points of contact your whole foot foot andyou are not compromising another joint that is all your going to look for those four things symmetry stability awareness and range of motion through each joint threach movement it sounds a difficult and time cstom it is really not you can generally kin o clear these things in one or two repetitions in a couple of seconds and what you are really going to look for this lots of scoring schemes you can ye tasket physicaltherapus ass or you i just look for abs aly terrible i cannot do it at all minor flaw or pretty close to get that that is really all 'm looking for some mice going sistem o zro one three zero is you are not going to do this exercise caue you are at a very high acute rest you might get her on rep one to morrow nover one ik a score of one is there is a minor flyw here we can probably do it but we need to be cautious of load and volume henother one is maybe it is perfect maybe it is not but go ahead and to do it on a reasonable proto call you'ld be fine i'm that is generally what you need to do is a cost free method of identifying good movement technique within any the things that you would do what about speed actually do not think this is one most people should test if you are high performance outly we can ront a forty ar dash or we can do i some different things with a velocity transtuceor on a bar bell if your weight lift or something for most people pure speed is really maximum velocity or acceleration or con the two ways we break it down it is not ustelling not that necessary o test what about number three power which i believe before you told me was speed times forse the reason why i do not worry too much about speed is because you can infer a lot of it from y power test and a power test is easier to do as well as easier to train for for most people the the costory version here is a simple broad jump this is stand a with n normal position jump out as far in front of yous to possibwy can a measure the distance between were you started and the back of your heel where it lands a superbasic number to look for there is your height you sho build a broad jump how tall you are if you are five foot five you shuld at five five six foot five et cetera it is not perfect i'm that is goin a ratc it down a little bit about fifteen per cent for females they dissimply do not have the power in general that men have not you can want to bring that down a little bit but that is a is a very crude number if you were to look at a high performan and a fell player if theres six feet tall there can be jumping nine to tan to eleven feet if you can jump your body height iweld not look in for optimization and this particular test what you are looking for red flags if you can jump your body height you are gonto be just fine that is incredibly straight forward and yet i've one question yep i'm assuming that i can squat down as low as i need to before i jump i can swing my arms from back to front as harder with as much mormentum i as i can muster and when i land you said i' men to take the measure from where the back my heels you han a measure the distance you actually covered declarify there is no running approach here there is no a steps in to it you are ta stand at a stil ya you can swing bounds as much as youd to do you gen a projectile offs you can a measure the distance from the tipo your to sobasely stand behind the line and then the furthest point back were you land basely the worst possible score not the best possible i caus your feet will not land symmetrically one's probing it to belitte it for our ther n now technically if you fall backwards in your hand touches the ground we mark that number by in this case just use the furthist point back of your back yell go from there i'll be drying it to morrow morning now if you have access to little bit more technology or yu just really want a kno i better number a a classic vertical jump it is a good starting place you can actually do this in a simple cosphr way you can just measure to your hands put them to gether that both of your a middle fingers are touching overlap them and put them directly over your head ah and you cone onl reach up as high as you can get and you mark that on the wall my brother and i use to do this all the time we would take a a high lighter the the yellow ones and cullor as much as we con on our finger tips touch the wall that the high lighter would stayin the wall if you actually go back to my house for my childhood you will see these markers all over our our house i'm sure apparents rthrby dad did not cere single that he did not care is thits whatever you gise doneory one you want ta measure that and then of course you are ging to jump with those two hands and touch besides you can up and you gt ta measue the distance between your standing reach and the actual heightly you jump there now the reason you are doing it two handed by the way is because if you do one handed you can actually reach pretty high by off setting your shoulders and now you are getting into differences of who has more shoulder mobility who has ability to can get up there a two foot stand ar two hand to standard approach is here il same thing no running approach here you can dip you can drive you can an do all those things you can swing your arms but youregingto be a two handed touch as it is a general iter do that and you want to look for a number of something twenty four inches or higher if if you are pass the age of fifty that number can come down a little bit to closer to twenty and a gain for females it is can o be ratchede down about fifteen per cent everyry oin to go if you are a a middle aged female and you are jumping twenty inches you are euare'n a pretgest spot i'm you gingto be looking really ni sair now if you can do that on a force plate that is even better these are very basely scales that will go out to multipole didges sometimes five to nine didgets passes hereroll and you ut stand these things you do thexact santest and yhese are very interesting because thy'll tell you not only how high you jump but they will tell you how much force you put in the ground they can also tell you how long it took you this cwall your rate of force development as well as impulse and speed to bunch ot other stuff which are our important to help you understand were on the power spectrum you need to be you would do that in addition to using some sort of velocity transducer on a barbell a very classic thing to do would be let us say your gn to do a squat and your get to put this a device on the bar bell and you cand that is gingto measure the speed which the barbell moves and you get to do that at forty per cent of your one repetition macts fifty per cent sixty per cent seventy eighty nine you up to hundred and that allows you de creet what is called a force velocity curve and you can start to see at what point when you start loading things heavy ou start slowing down too much and that will tell you what pa t of the force velocity curve that you want a trainin to optimize your power iwhy tht's important a lot of people will do things when i'm traing for power how heavy should i left wel the general answer people say is thirty per cent of your one rmax but that is actually not true at all what is most optmal for power development which will discuss more much later is depending on where your flod in the forst pelocity cr if you have access to technolegy that that can give you lot mor inside information if not do the broad jump test or the highlighter on your finger tips and jump at tuts the lall test at andy yelpans i ey jis you nont come along as alredy the walls are already mest up just go had come up to washington will do it pantastic what about strength right strength is realy important you need to measure this in a in multiplareas and we will start off with grip streng gape you can do this in two ways i you can buy a hand grip dinaumometer now these are anywhere between twanty to a hundred dollars anywhere the djactual used to be risan school hundreds of dollars and now you can littely buy them on anywabside for twenty five boxso my last recommendition is technically that is not costhry i know your whole thing about the cosphre protocos but twenty five bok some call in that basely costery i you can bring that ina testat and as thit is a little device where you can squeeze and your a d and i would do your right hand and your left han i you want a look for a symmeteries there but you want to look for something typically those or thregin to give you a value in keylograms and a you want t look for something a minimum score here of forty keelograms ideally you are oup past sixty would be a really good spot to bean iyou want to make sure that there is no less than ten per cent variation between your left and right hand you are you are non dominant hand actually should not be that much weeker an nestest what ou'll actually sy lot oftimes as te non dominant can be often time stronger i'm because the dominant hand is more for movement precision writing things that you want them to be close i if you are a male and youare under forty kulograms on a hand gript inaeumometer were werk need to train that if you'r female it is not that much lower but about thirty five kilograms is the cot off point iif you are above fifty five we can add a tree training but i'm not worried about leaving it out to your training if your female if it is aboute fifty that is my sort of cat off were weon ago that is a fairly cheap one another onethat you can nectul do is tis a dead hang yu can hold on to any bar ideally one that is thin enough to where you can wrap your whole hand around it you do not want to be using a a giant fat grip im youre' have a false readin here something going to the gim and jumping on any pull up bar or a pull up rack you ant a hang an this is a simple time test in general we we should be able to hang for a minimum of thirty seconds as what we are what we are looking for thirty to kind of fifty seconds is my good but we could probably get better here if you are cruisan above sixty seconds i'm generally pretty happy i this sactualy y a good example of when females tand t o be better gripstrength and women is tends to be stronga they can hang for quite a long time i' they will still standers do not really change that much afor women now if you are exceptionaly large this thing does not scale perfectly ye if you are two hundre forty pounds and even if you are lean its just hard the to hang and hold two nd or forty pounds conversely if you'r hundred forty pid five pounds even if you are unhealthy you are goin to build to hang for long time thit is is not that much waight to carry yo just rough numbers that is to start off with that is grip straingts what about strength elsewhere in the body the primary as yuyou can do an upper body strang test if you uld although it is not technically something we do very often happy to do it one i maxpench presser something that tht's gright i the more ont i'm generlly more interested in is a leg extension test and the reason i this is a back squat is better a barble back squat is look that is my that is my jam that is my life right i's this very technically demandin and it it is challenging you ned spoters you need comfer i a lockgoes int this for for the average person a leg extension test is fairly standardized you ot to wory about technique and people can just get into it and go and what you want to look for there is is a a couple of standards you want ta hit a gain a very simple answer here is bodyweight can you do a leg extension with your bodyweght one repetition one repetition i can answer that right now can you no you cannot no i can hax squat a reasonable man o weight but un us on the leg extension this morning an night is a nautilus macie machine and i certainly could not let i'll tanture my bodyway leme nte mclar fory were you doing a single leg no bile out er you cannot leg since you body wi know what i certainly can hamstering colonel my bodywight o c we may we have some i'm deficiencieson are quads it we ned to go after yo but that that is a pretty good number you want to be at if you go up an age past eige forty every decade that can come down about ten per cent and you will till be in a pretty good slot if you are fifty years old and you are a hundred and seventy pounds if you can do one sixty year ar pretty good sir a spot and then you go us again take it down about ten per cent every decate after forty but prior to forty there is realyi no change in strength i but certainly somebody in theire forties to fifties should be ablie th leg extension their bodyweight nodid i look for to our discussion a bit later i talk o about how to build strength yet anythes strength tes they do not have to be done to a technical true one rat max you can use what are called re petition a conversion at quation but on a load that you think is kind of clothes to your maximum and just do it for as many rapts as you cant as long as it is under five raps total you can then actually go on line and enter that into any number of calculators anywhere and it will tell you o cate you did three re petitions at two hundred pounds you are one rep max is probably two hundred fifteen whatever there is estimate equation if you do not want to spend the time are you no t truly comfortable absolutely going to your true whene i max just get to a number that is fairly close and do as many as you can and then go on a line again one ret max estimator equations are everywhere i'm if you get past five repetitions or the accuracy of those equation starts going down do not put on something a goi did twelve repts of it and then try to figere out your wone ri max it will get clotes you start woving past that you just getting worse and worse and worse accuracy i want to make sure whether you doin the leg extension test or a front squt test you do not technically have to do an absute one ran max i'm if neither of those are anoption another one i a lot here it simply a front squat or a gobla squat hold you are to hold to waight in front of your chest whether a kettlebellis as grated here a dunbell is fine here and you wan to hold about half of your bodyweight go all the way to the bottom position and try to hold that for about forty five seconds it it is a pretty good indicator of i'm number on your position it is hard to be in a bad position for that long at that load as well as core strength and low baxs to billy it is a very different indicator i'm then say tha leggy sentien test but its it is a really nice one it does not require many moving parts iit is more difficult than leg extension but it is it is quite a bit more functional and it is can tot givyon in sight into a lot more areas than just the quatroseps forty five seconds down at the bottom of the squat yet and then returning to a standing position yet in if you cannot do the return i actually at i'm not that worried but as long as you can hold that good position without a technical break down in that forty five seconds that is a really good spot i'm asnan intro i want a third of your bodyweight for thirty seconds trific i plannd to attempt all of those strength tests very soon what about hypertrophy sure i'm actian before we get into that i want a jump backwarly quickly it is important to add a couple of caviots to the strength trengths of there is too that i want number one these are assuming you are a technically proficien i do not wnt you to do any exercise to exhaustion or to maximum strength if you are not comfortab with your technic a just these accordingly if you are not comfortabl with the front squot do the leke extension if for i din't comfortabwith that do something different we never want to utilize maximum testing if it is going to come witht e consequence a a sere secure intry that is the most important fie the second one is you are warm up protocall we will have a huge a fact on your actural results and whenever you do these test especiallyif you aregongto do a test andthn i test again down the line you want to make sure that that warm up protocol is standardize now again the enase and i cin we can i can give you resources has specific guides for exactly what to do for your warm up protocol prior to wone i max testing we can go there and you can look that stnuff up we can have that to shon uttor something yet i think im when we get into a deeper discussion about strength and hypertrophy and resistance training in general if we cou touch into the at the best warm up protical i know i have mine and i'm a certain it is cann't be subotimle bis not everything every that is how i's not every o conversation weve ever had where i learn all the things undering in corectly but i do make changes on the basis of what you tell it is not in correctly much as it is suboptable the three kind way of telling it is in correcto thank you a what about hy perturue there thing you ant t pay attention to here is you have the esthetic a portion of hypertu that is entirely up to you there is no rational you can deside what you feel looks good or does not look good that is irrelevantthere is a sufficient about you need to have where below that is detrimental to your health regardless of your out comes and the best way to do this is a couple of ways any sort of body composition test it can do this whether this is a a scan a the a decxs o scan which is a gold standard or other a ways of biological a biolectical impedance or otherways there is a ton of different test youd get therare pretty closhe what you want to pay attention to when you get a dex o scant is a number called f f m i and that sands for fat free mass and decks you can look at again any number of on line calculators these are all standard does not actually matter when you pull hem up you' off to worry about looking up and wether not it is right or not or something and that is an actually ell you if you have sufficient muscle mat and a number you want to look for in general of something if youre man you are f f am i should be something twenty or hiher if you are woman you wanto look for something eighteen that that is the targets if you get pass twenty four twenty five for a man that is a lot of muscle mass assuming your reasonably lean now if you are f of emi is twenty four twenty five but your body fat is forty per cent you are actuialy just a very very large individual you are not you are not n a going to gray spot when we say these sort of numbers it she asumption that you are probably sub thirty per cent body fat for a man in sub thirty five for a woman those the numbers there are on calculators all you really need to know is you'r total body weight you'r body fat per centage and then your height you ca anster those three numbers and then they will tell you your f ifa mi scoring l correct for anadgusted value then most those will actually tell you the greeting ruberic in them si good average bat et cetera but those the numbers we look at if you are as a man sub seventeen as a womans sub fifteen noware an area of of pretty severe physiological detriment for insufficient muscle and some of our latter discantion will talk about why that matters that is not am sub seventeen per cent body fat thits is specifically the f f m ai that is a correct yet what about muscular endurance is this wren tell me an you do walsets this is really nice you can to any number of tests here a a standard plank it is a good testament of of muscandurant can you hold a front plank for sixty seconds can you hold a side plank for forty five seconds pretty easy if you are able to do a push up if you cannot that sort of tells you lone it is actualy interesting if you cannot do a single push up that is not a muscan durance is yue tonsectualy now strength as you cause it is a one ot max problem m we want to be able to do for again for a general male we should have no prob doing twenty five pluss consecutive push ups i apologize for interrupting you but as long as we are tig about pushups just mention form are we talking chest touching the ground a elbows breaking right angles what is a proper push up according to you are laboratory unless you ave a very specific reason to limit range of motion i want all my testing done through a full joint range of motion i this is different for the person it is individualize to them but in general for a push up this would be a full complete lock out of the elbows on the top and a full chest touch or close to it at the ground you can do it different it does not really matter but just keep i standard from your pretest your postest if you are trying to mark progress a but for us unless we have a very specific reason we are going ful arrange of motion for all these tus twenty five push t wa firo males for a male it is a standard and even something ten is a number were looking for again is con o minimum cantegories i for an upper body mustcer n durancs and not to get two down in the weeds but a i have observed other people course nummer myself not i'm gitting but observed other people pausing at am maybe at repetition fifteen catching their breath and then continuing or you that man be a siy lihet is a a piston that would be a fail to no pauses correct just up down up down an trying to get yet least ten but i deally twenty five i learned this lesson in one of our studies i'l probably nine years ago wer we did not clarify that and we actualy had an individual he was not theasnt he was not being a various he just figured out if i do a couple take a quick break into a cup he quadrouple his posttest result from his pretest result because he figured out that little hack you want a stanardize it it is not that i'm against or have some sort of strong belief it is just trying to keep political standardize and which means any break fell test ten to twenty five push ups minimum for males what a out for fo else ife a if it is subten for a man that is again in you are very severe red flag problem we really we to see a number above twenty five lookin that that is wherwere anchor anything beteen tween ten and twenty five is e ye but not severe it means they have work to do we have work to doanifer and for females for i female yu a skill that sort of back a female the answer could bes little zero i see yougin to see that can you do a full ipposition if the're in that position we are generally not going to do a muscar n durinstest from the knees we weare to know the answer is yeres here i we will actually to fall to another test wit i'll talk about in a second yere for those of those folks anyth that is in a skaledoun oit right basely you looking at fifteen is that marker twenty five ons for the mal where i want to see above fifteen and if i do wore good anything between five to fifteen is ha number of o k if your sub five i wed wed generally have some problems and if that is different between one and zero than i now we zeras is is a problem we should bil to do that fse female can not do ten ful pushops yet ten foo puships is hard for a female depending on sins o cay lout say a female cannot do five ful pushops sye said rather than go to an keese down versione what would you do to assess their muscular endurance and would you then also encourage them to work on their strength well but absolute again if they cannot do they can do anthing less in three i you re o be straing the fact if you want to look at muscar en durance in general this is a bit of a off topic ben a promise onl keep short not come right back when i was a doctror studenti had a two labmates one of em was a runner e female a hundred twenty pounds somethike that small en ther one was a male and he was bas le a straight pro he lifts aweights thousand do any others for of training t oes a very classic not training programe but cannetrane and they were sort of bantering back and forth for a while and baseca she was saying you are unfit you cannot run at all and he saying youre week you cannot do a pullep ads they challenge each other to competition as said at the end of the year the gurl is going to do twenty six pullops and the guy had to run a marathon twenty six miles that was the thing andthen there as some sort of consequence for whoever scorta failed til the guy quickly try to firgot howd hl mi can run twenty six miles when i have not run a mile and many many many years we just arted running you three miles for miles whatever she what course they both of rana meatly to me rightn t she was how they hell i cannot do a pullo and i was great and i gave her very specific maximoll strength proto calland she was wo i want to go to the assisted pullpt machine and work on doing suts a twenty five as i've got to get my muscar an durance up and i try to explain to her you are muscay endurance is or relemant if you cannot do on it is never going to matter she did the muscuran durance protocall the entire thing did not listen to me the end of the year came she still produced exactly zero pullops point is if you look at muscar endurance where is it a strength and wears at action muscar en durance the general sort of number that you are looking for is under eighty per cent i that is gon to tell you as this a muscar n durance problem or is an oup strength problem under ye per cended one re petition ye yet what i mean by that is this in fact thi actuleas in your question the other way to as sess muscar endurance is take the exact strength test you did from the the talk five minutes go what which when did you do lod that to seventy five per cent and then do that for as many repetitions as you can and that is a tremendous barometer of muscar an durance if you were able to do two hundred pounds on your leg exstension tests but seventy five per cent tat and y that is many ra you can you want to look for more than eight repetitions if you are below a repetitions then we have a muscular endurance problem if it i if it is higher than that if you got fifteen or twenty then we know we have probably some problems an your peak strength or the test itself that is a good eight to twelve sort of number it is where you ant to be looking at ot for ter what about an arobit capacity this one's more challenging yoeither have to goto laboratory and do something a windgate tests this is a thirty second maximul am test where you'r goin to see how much work can you possibly do in that thirty seconds if you do not have a lad us as to laboratory you can you can do this on any any protocall you want yo this cund be sprinting this can be on aalike an air bite this could be on a rower anything that anything where you can exert maxima leffort and you do not afeter ward about teconical problem i generally do not to do things a cattle bell swing or something thathere just twomany other variables you need to be able to goes hardest you possibly can knowing you are going to get to a place of tremendous fatigue now in ta lab we often use wat called a bosco protocal and you'egong to stand in a force plate youre ong to do as many vertical jumps as fast as you can as high as you can for sixty seconds and youre absolutely destroyed by second forty five e either use that when get protocal or that bosco protoco if you want thet again take any o those other places thirty seconds or up to forty five seconds up to men if you on it does not ranly matter and you just mark down the distance you cover that is all you we do not really have standard for these things because it is going to be different how far you can travelin thirty seconds on a treadmell it is is can be different than sprinting in the field or on the assault bik or whatever a whil you really want to worry about there is can you complete it and then how awful do you feel afterwards what what you really want o think about here is not those protocals but this you want to think about can you get close to your predicted maximum heartright the the number we throughout is two hundred and twenty minus your age if you are fifty years old two twenty minust fifty you should be able to get to a maximum heartwrihter round one seventy beasts permenet now that number is extremely generic if you do not get there that does not have any indication of your bisiness you get higher that does not mean you are any more fit it is just a rough number here is what i'm what i want youto do in this case your heartright recovery is the better metric i want you to get up to a maximum heartright and then test your heartraght recovery and what you should be looking for there is about half a beat a recovery per second you are gingto get up to a place where you reach absolute terrible exhaustion maximum fatigue test your heartright and then count right have a time er going within sixty seconds you should have again at half a beat per second you should have a hartry recovery of thirty beasts per men within the next the next minute to min recovery t should begin half that sixty beats those are rough numbers to go by and your three menute recovery is again half abhout again that is the closest way if your hartry recovery is worse than that then we know we have a problem in your anoroba capacity or youre carnivascopassy lov it what about number eight maximol heart rate beu's what you just describe sones a lot maximal hartr i this is your view to max the goald standard here is to actually go into a laboratory and get this thing done we can act your run of avil to max tess where you put a mass on clocked all your gases and run you to there and there is a very specific proto call for a completion of a a true maximum test and is scientist will know that if you do not have access to that you can do a copple of test one of em is called a twelve minute coopers test this is simply time you can a run for twelve minutes as far as you can and you can record the distance you covered again you can go on line to any a any number of of calculators enter tht distance in and that will tell you your proximu ir estimate oveal to max that is a twelve minute sprint twelve minutes rent maximum distance you can cover in twelve minutes keeping a steady pace the whole time or go what everyu want the goal is to get maximum dif discovered in twelve minutes that is anywhere between a mile to two pluss miles e baying o half it you are but you just do that coop for twelve minute test got it i told you if you remember it a robe of capacity is eight to twelve sort of minutes where you are gin to see a real true test of that veal to max you simply cannot get that i'm in under a few minutes it is it is a thet if you want you can do a little gentler version of that im there are a number of sub maximal tess there in fact there is a one mile lock test you can do again all youre going to do is in this case you have to have some sort of either a stop watch or ideally hart ra monter an all you have to do as is is a rock for one mile some maximal test is you can a walk a mile record the time record your hart rate at the end enter those in and those wild give you agan estimates of rebuse to max that is the o my gosh i cannot run for twelve minutes as hard as i poss we can or an want to do it or i we have a lot of hes in our executive programm a sec my knee hurts to bad i've got back pain when i run whatever can i ook and you do walk tis and it is pretty accurate if you do a corractly technically all you have cact to do is measure your heart rate on your youn no can count sixty seconds but its is easier to work with everyone is watches and stuff now tos sweare to hart ry monitr plug in those numbers im at again those are all standard a calculations anywhere you find those i you ought to worry about the source you just enter your stuff fin in there cun be runnin out the same occasioni the id of the twelve minute run i many give it a shot soit for for years we do to one mile version of this and o this is a lot more science on the cupetomi could protest we did that it is pretty good and it is not even remotely close to fine it sounds fun for other reasons ye well it is it it were fun in the sense that it reveals a lot yet powerful potent super there is no hiding you can hide with a leggi centen test it does not hurt that pat but you you can not feel anything but the twelve minute run as far as you can test these are really actually si psychiatric diagnostic test are of sourcur number nine long duration steady state yet exercise i think of this as a ca endurance but as you mention before there are other forms of endurance londration steady state exercise yet you really want a think about this as not a standard number this is you should maintain consistent work out put for over twenty plussmenites e and this one i want you to dispick something that it was in your lifestal is there a loop around your house that you can do is there some proto call that you you to use it for and you are simply going to test your ability can you maintain work without stopping that is all it needs to be now ideally i personly to throw little twistin here which is can you do this with nasal breathing only that is what i feel really good if you can go thirty straight minutes without needing to take a break i'm walking does not really cut i unless you are very very unfit in which case if waking thirty minutes without a break is a challenge oke i there but if you can i want you moving at a non walking pace i do not care what zone this is to three four or five i do not care shonly you can maintain minimum of twenty minutes of work with no breaks no intervalis no downtime and i gan ideally breathing though your nose only i love this list but it worries me a bit not because any one of these tests is necessarily that overwhelming but because i'm unclear about how to arrange performance of these different tests for instance do i separate them i'm doing one tast long duration out put on one day and i'm doing strength on another day those seem pretty obvious to me but arther onces that one can combine on different days how much time should one give oneself in between these tests and how often should one do in assassiment just as we do not want in te sarilyes valuate bodyat changes by getting on the scale three times to day m once a day at the same time each day is more practical how often should we be assessing our fitness for each in every one of these well the way that i would say this is you want to pick the one that is the worst and do that more quickly if for example you do the upper body strength test and you are fantastic if you can bench rest double your bodywy t i do not need to test your bench very often for the average person not a power after but maybe once a yearor may be not even that we just do not neu o get there however if we then test your your view of two max and in your twelve minutes you cover a total of a half a mile then we might wont to test that every month and we are got to let our priorities emphasize which one we are going to do mar often i would recommend doing this full battery once a year fol batter yo mean the entirelist on one theentire not one day but within a week you could take a week now you could do these tachnically all in two days a three days split here it is probably best if you were to dis a hay this is testing week actually love this for beginning in the year i whatever it is a you sort of change your training buti think it once a year just once a year you should probably go to a physician and get full blood work i a full o heart scan and in everything that i and then if maybeyou had heartishother come back in attest you or frequently whatever the caseis right you should probably run through this and you aregoing to be thinking the abbit i do not want ta i give up on my exercisore ting that week well i promise you you are not going to finish this week and think i did not do very much work this week it is it is get ta feeld great and then you arecon have a very nice barometer of exactly where you need to change and and prior toi your training for the next quarter half a year or wherever wou want to go if you want act tou do this every six month that is rea we mand o bac you doin this quite no thing more every six months as a general i test that is a really good way to do but if if minimum if youre arguneg with me give me once a year you on't do this which order to do them an the non fatiguing test you can do whenever this is the the body composition scan the effif and my the body fat composition all this suff can be done wever i generally to do that though as you'r very first ectivity the reason is we know that a cue d exercise can heavily influous things body composition measurements because of inful inflammation water store to cetra it is easiest o dist sort of get that off of a fortyeight hour rest you want to make sure you do not do any hard exercise the day before a body composition test and probably fortyeight hours before that just start yourself off for that your movement test can be the same thing i you do not want to try to do a a sessiment of how well you'r squatting if you are incredibly sore from your your brutal squine tu ten to do those things when you are the most fresh then what you want to do is any skill or maximum strength or power goes at the very beginning of the day any fatiguing thing happens at the end and you could easily do this all right i'm going to do my power test my broad jum gright you are not can be fatigued at all from that and on the same day since i'm already pretty warm dup now min a roll right into my leg strength test and since i'm really warmed up i'm going to do my leg muscular an durn sess right there sice is a very comonstratagyou we use would do our one r at max leg extension five minutes seven minutes whater we need to do come back loati to seventy five per and do as many raps as you can wel you culd roll right into then your upper body test or your grip straength test or anything else a you wanht to do there i is there a little bit of influence ye but really for most people it is not tht bad a what influice i mean if you do a leg stringth test coming back on doing an opper body strength test afterwards it is not that big adeal give yourself fifteen you'rself twenty ments keep plenty time ou can nock out your strangth testing in rasconrndrance testing all in one day that could be you could do your performance i you'r skill dignostic youre power jump test your strength and your muscan durance and all that suffis knocked out you are going to have to come back on a separate day and do your anerobic test this is thirty seconds maximondurance things that you could though if you wanted do that after you are long duration test you longguration test as gand as is can a function as a i be warm up or you culd loot those things or you do them on separate days youe going to have to do your veal to maxtests on its own day for the most part unless you wanted to do again your movement or your body composition sort of before those things im you really have the ability to kind of mix and match ideally this most realistically probaly takes three days if you ant to separate them into four or five the more separation you do the better dayter you i get it is just a question of how how pedantic are you really trying to get here and are you willing to lose five per cent to then saye the whole day then you can do sort of things and multiple stacks that is that is how i would break up what i'm hearing is better to do it than to not do it most definile and be rational don to a do not try and do your strength output late in the day when your fatigued if you are going to combine with some of the imsteady stateen durance in a maximal heart rate fine understand there may be a slight defis it there but tested the same way each time in what you really lookin for is improvement yet and you can also do the hartray recovery under any a outic yo cou o the hartright recovery i'm after you veal to max as well you finish that thing and then just na againto the same test for up toe three menths these ar fantastic toools i'm almost thempted to say that i'm willing to post my numbers but that actually violates the o qoor principl thi think we are getting out here which is that it is highly unlikely that anybody is going to be phenominal across the board am in certainly there will be individuals that ar but base on everything we talked about earlier specificity of training and im how extensively somebody is been training a certain way will without question lopside them if you will yet toward being better in some of these assastiments and less good in others and that is just simply the way that these adaptations work yet and it is not you do not need to be optimal in all these areas kto be quotico optimal health from this perspectiv yu just want to make sure again there is no severe per formance ancors s what we call them right the we will not want anyo these severe constraints cause you are going to get limited by that thing and you want to do as move that up to just sufficient or concerning and get it away from that if you do that that things i can catch you you can be able to continue to pusue pursue optimization an any the one things t at ou have a specific passion for which is genly what moves people right you you train im you feel better you train because thereare all these benefits to it and in jese this audience probably could list hundreds of them but you also train because you generally to get better at something a lot of us that have something and you want to make sure thatyou are not gone hav i know you'r goodt endurance but you relly shouldn trainin more we do not want that message not at all i want you to love your training we just want to make sure that you are not loving that much that you are not taking some blinders off and missing another area which would actually again yu pull that performance hinker this whole ship sails faster with less effort and less friction what i love about this is also that as you have described it it is not just for athletes or people that are superinto fitness it is also for people that just want to be healthy and want esthetic changes and that is why they are exercise in which i think atcounts for prealy large percentage of people out there and i think of what you described is it incredibly well structured incredibly clear and incredibly actionable i want to thank you for that i serious about my willingness to do this and at least share those numbers with you and i think for most people that are seeking what you listed ox before esthetic changes functionality in longevity it is clear that all nine of these are going to be important in somemer artor another before we close out i want to go back and finish off the metrics for eveal two maxcs and on't actually think i gave you numbers on that in general for men a minimum number we want to look aut here is thirty five mill leaders per culogram per menute and for women that be about thirty wewe can actually push aa lot higher on those things in reality i want to see men above fifty if i could just interrupt you for a second when you say forty milliers per kilegram milliers of what specifically yes what actuo those metrics mean is the first one mill leaders is oxygen such a mount of oxygen kilograms is body weight it is how much oen can you bring in per kilegram of bodyway per minute is a volume of oxygen per your size in a time duration in fact the way that you calculated i is you multiply your cardia calpet by whats teld your avio two difference your carria calput is your heart rate times your stroke volume how much a blood you'r pumping out per pump as your stroke volume how many times your pumping or you'r beating you multiply that by your avio two difference you ve o two difference is arery mine is vain difference the mount of oxyien in your arteries mine is the amount of oxtion your vain which is going to tell you how much you took up in your capilaries in your muscles you take those two factors moltipime to gather and there is our view two macts you knoas you were describing that i imagine you getting to an efimori machine and seeing that equasion lighting up in your brain cause clearly it is committed to memory very well thank you for that clear description yet to finish those numbers i i really truly want to see some a man above fifty n i'm not even really stoked until i get above fifty five in fct it is sort of funny dave costell whose lab i did my page dand he was retired by the time but he he is again what he is legendary figures an exercise physiology i'm started in the seventies he would always say there is no human excuse to be belowe sixty which i always always damn l that is really actually pretty hard to get to if ye but was he oh yes dear e now he still actually setting world records in these last couple of years and is all the master's records for swimming and encycling is some he was a supersuperfit guy i he was always above sixt e's probably fifty something now even ogh he is now eighty or whatever eight years oll year with f the o two acts of fifte's probab really not fifty's probably but he is probably going to member that earlier in the we talked about i have the ninety two year old by the view two maxt of thirty ight they's probing to break that record when he gets there i'm sure i'm s i gan in fact i girin to you he has that number in his brain ihave a talked him in fifteen years but i guarantee that number is in his brain and he is proably training for it i love it and i love it because it proves that exercise pays off oh yet it is one of the few things in life where the is a direct relationship between work and outcome yet that is as henry rawlins described in his wonderful essay if you are familiar with that oh my gost or you are punkrock i henry amsure i mat i certainly know who he is and iaw his he has work an incredible one page a paper sort of something to do with the iron any basele describes that as this is the one thing where it is truth it is the most true thing you will ever do i which is y love for that im it is almost a principle of nature hon er persent yet with with the women i really want to see the women if i want to see men above fifty five i really want se whon above fifty ias the target in if you you'r there i'm pretty goods you can do the math on then the middle ground of what is o k but we need o work on it in fact if you look across the literature i different athletes you aregoing to see the the really high level endurance folks you they may past seventy or eighty in fact im there was talk a few years ago f o guy breaking a hundred a i's an eighteen or nineteen year old but i actio do not think was ever fully confirmed repeated but certainly you will see plenty of people ninety five im in those extremes if you look at other sports football or basketball there probably going to be in the fifty five sixty five sort a rain if you is an average person or fifty five i that is a really good marker to be in if you get even close to that you are' a good sbot im i'm sorry if i let you down dave it jist looke out you describing this average persing ligan me with distelow bit of sympathy lagh if you if you reach the standard of average andrew a listen you are giving me prompts all over the place to try and a improve my metrics whatever they happen to be and i think that is one of the great values of getting objective numbers the even if they have to be measured by somemony's back to the envelope techniques that am at igus we always teach people in the laboratory right that a tool can be a not extremely precise but as long as it is reliable corderyis still value there and of course you would love to have the most precise and most reliable tool but if you cannot then at least go for a reliable tool and measure for consistency yet for the real rorld reliability bes felidity is as much as we can' for lot of things were talking about especially for using it as a metric of did i get better as long as that tools reliable a body composition is all these things have inherent error and some of them are smaller some ofthem are larger but as you mention having standrization with an attesting protocol is can allow you to measure progress anusk i tell you weareout a now that we sort of cover all the these airies of adaptation we walk the history we walk through a bunch of the explanations for wy people or are maybe not geting the results that they wantog get though their training the way i would to go withthe rest of our conversations would be to just go through each of those adaptations step by step and make sure i cover very specific protocols for if you have run through this testing and identified an airy ofe weakness maybe you have sort of been lifting a lot could you lifting in you maybe realize that your carty ofvascerfitness or your hart ry recoveries not where really should be or the opposite we talk about maybe ou're doing a lot of that type of work and your strength is not there your rmovemalqualities not there you have identified a problem how do i specifically sall thet what are the evidence base and a most effective protocalls that i could put myself in for each one f these categories and i think that would i give people a lot of take home value abut is can to take us some time to cover it is it is going to have to come across over multible conversations i between you and i very onl looking forard to each and all of those conversations and am i want t ad just one more metric to our discussion to day which is really just my way of saying thank you because if there were a metric for amount of useful information per sentence spoke you would be at the upper level of that metric you have this amazing ability to provide much knowledge in a clear and concise and to day listed out format that is both interesting grounded in science anactionable on behalf of everyone listening and certainly for myself as well sone to say thank you why i appreciate the compliments and i'm looking for to the next conversation a jumping right into speed strength and i perch re training and whar the evident

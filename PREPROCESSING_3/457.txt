welcome to the hubermanlatponcas a science science space to e i ma endurhubermen and on a professor of neurobiology in ofthemology at stamford school of medicine today i have the pleasure of introducing doctor duncan french as my guest on the huberman labpodcast doctor french is the vice president of performance at the u f c performance institute and he has over twenty years of experience working with the lete preofessional and olympic athletes prior to joining the u f sa french was the director of performant science at the university of notor day and he has many many quality pure reviewed studies to his name exploring for instance how the particular order of exercise whether not one performs indurance exercise prior to resistance training or vice versa how that impacts performance of various movemencs and endurance training protocals as well as the impact on hormone such as tostosterone estrogen and some of the stress hormones such as quartizal he is also done fascinating work exploring how neuro transmitters things dopamine and apinefran also called the trenolin can impact hormones and at hormones can impact nero transmitter release what is particularly unique about doctor french's work is that he is figured out specific training protocalls that can maximize for instance tostosterone output or reduce stress hormone output in order to maximise the effects of training in the short term and in the long term today you are going to learn a lot of protocals whether not your into resistance training or endurance training you will learn for instance how to regulate the duration of your training and the type of training that you do in order to get the maximum benefit from that training overtime whether or not you are somebody who just exercises recreationally for your health whether not youre in amateur or professional athlete or whether not you are just trying to maximize your health through the use of endurance and or resistance training today's discussion will have a wealth of take aways for you there are only a handful of people working at the intersection of elete performance mechanistic science and that can do in a way that leads to direct immediately applicable protocalls that anybody can benefit from doctor french also provides some incredibly important insights about the direction that sport and exercise are taking in the world to day and their applications towards performance and health before we begin i'd to emphasise that this podcast is separate fror my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire an effort to bring zero costo consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at let ic greens is an all in one vitim an mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve m delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there eason i started taking athletic greens an th reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutricional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which or vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called dopmicrobiom and the ways in which the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essentally with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without letic greens i get the vitemens i need the minerals i need and the probiocs to support my microbiom if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic greenstock cam slash hubermen and claim a special offer they will ive you fiv free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of data ow showing that vitemend three is essensial for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficien inviteem in d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stock cam slash hubermen to claim the special offer of the fivfree travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to today's episode is also brought to us by element element is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratioes of electrolytes are an element and those are sodia magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar ove talk many times before in this podcast about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerve self function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodia magnesium in potassium present in the proparatios all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and ifhydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that youre getting the proparatios of electrolites if you to try element you can go to drink element that is eleement doc cam slash hubermen nd you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try elemen you can go to element element dok cam slash huberman and now my conversation with doctor duncan french duncan french great to see you again laglie slali sancu dont othenomany stanfid professes in the forms institutes really exacted ol this placeis amazing and a you have a huge roll in making it what it is the reason i'm excide to talk with you is that yeu you are one of these rare bsts that you have been involved in human performance an athletic performance at the collegiat level a you are obviously very involved in emamay now in the sy performance institute and you also a had the fortunate experience i to think of doing a ph t in a what exactly was the p tn is exercise physolitise it the arti you'r familiar also with desining studies control groups all the sorts of thing that in my opinion any way or com lacking from the internet i social mediaversion of i exercise science which is that people throw out all sorts of ideas about how people should be training what they should be doing and eating an not eating and doing an scertainly science doesnt have all the answers but i just think it rare to find somebody that is at the convergence of all those different fields and i i've a lot of questions for you to day that i i'm sure the audience ore canto be really interested in er well lhisten i men nigh i preciate that is very humbling and an you have worked arter get to where i am an but i've always tried to be authentic and i think authenticity comes along side an academic rigor and an objectivit and insi and an a knowledge base right at the end of the day its about an having confidence having experteas and been able to deliver that expertes to to in my world to athlets an and i think a that is what i've always tried to do ave tried to of many strings to my bow an that i can talk with many different hats on a one down talking to a coachs next am talking to an athlete the nex i am talking to a sey o the next time talking to a an academic professor tha you not i think you o been able to where those different harts is certainly skill sat tha i've tried to an to build thrugout my career and you i as ihave been bless to work with ha thing os thirty six different professional or limpic sports last time of co iccounsid an yets been been a while rides thin graint mut which of those sports was the most unusual an i've wort with crown green bawling an wics a do not knows an american gid on o a a o ao basically imagine a an a a twenty foot by twenty foot scet square of tuf an with a a small rais in the middle i eat the crown it is it did slopes to the edges am and then use you you throw out white jack a smaller ball and an ye you smort a to rawl out larger bulls to to trying get closest to the jackit si it is a very a youropean thing that is thebut yes bots performace to crown green bawl in ego oam wow and then to i mix martial arts ioliand everything in between im almost lines a can you give us solober o your background your word you start out were from originally ya from the north east of england an some from a time called harriga which is in in yorksher which is a northern kind of erer of nic junny aether all your on ye if you can imagine yet with the two weeks of somemer that we get in am but ya men i did my year my only graduate studies there in sport sienc si in i did teacher training to be a physical education teacher after tha most people ar then your work os h high school physical education teacher your gre experience working with kids you a developin an athletic qualities but something in the back of my mind always yon i wanted more i wanted to be a in to be at the h air and of eleat sporting i was a faile daflet mike many people ike i represent to my country an indifferent sports and things but i never made it professionally and that that little seed was soand in as much as i then stad to reach out to and yo to different areas to do a pchty whether was in the uka or also you chance my arm took u pony if we get over to the states in all my bodies were going on gap years after the finish university or whatever and and going to baly and hanging out o whatever travelling through tyland and i fig it well o i've always loved the states and chanagone kill to berds y one stone and do somethin academic continue my studies and but also doing a diffent environment get some life life experience in them many many rejections as as an show you can of a wer from different professors whetherit was roging or an oker or in a william cra you svote to these fell i just cold cold colden and and sent out information andthing yes o i hav ave you got any opportunities am push back from mor but yon dogged and kept kept for is asking an m yea doctor william crame who was at balstate university in indiana at the time and a a muscle nour end of coronologist and and researcher in muscle physiologys in resistance training and yeu basically saidliss and i can guarantee fond in for the first yeryou studies but not the next three something at tipical acad em a yi can take care of you but not that well necessarily ri ispoke to my parents since that i can we can we take upon ind that they were great in supporting me and and yeat long story short came out to a to big him a pcty at bolstate after a year doctor crame a transferred to ucon ayou connetica ince tores in the northeaster and a ma transferred to him an with him and am yev four great years with mat with mapechty and and getim ma phty with the with a really prolific and research croup that looked a in on youro end o chronology homonl work and but yusing resistance train in primarily as an exercise strassa ad as tha magu mechanism and then looking all the different physiologies off the back of resistance training yer you as were enormously productive i found a dozens of papers on how weit training impacts omonts and your names on all of em am and it is remarkable i i have a question about this o just inject or question about wait training in hormons you hear ot us all the time that doing these big heavy compound movements or resistance training increases enrigence things tastasteronthtda and forth does any one know how that actually happans what about move what about in what is it about engaging motor in or ants under heavy loads sends a signal to the endicran system e release tastastron i've never actually been able to find that in a taxbok yer well imean and how can i do more ofas much as i know iu knownd again 'm digging in to the anals of donken frenches can of brain now but a ye haw manything it is distress response rights mechanical stress and its medabolic stracts and these he ou knas downstreme regulation of tastosteron release at the gonads an comes from many different areas and ou know that there my work primarily lookeda and yo caticolameans and and an simpathetic arousal then ow apen afrin a draorects yepan afrin adranalin and you noradranalin and hhow they were signaling that signan cascade usin an the h pieaxis releasing and cortesal and thand looking at how that also influence the adren on medola to release and yo androgens and thend signal ing that the gonads there iss an intresting question in u presumably waigt training in women people who dn't have tasties also it increases to thestrons yend is that purely through the adreals when women left waits there are drena glance release tustas absolutely mean that is the only area of tastosteron release for females and yes it is the same downstreme cascade ovously the extent to which it happens is is significantly less an females but that is how thatthes goods good date out there that shows youknow females can increase their anabolic environment there internalanablic miliu and using resistance training is astressa and then they get the consequent muscle tissue growth and whethere is tend an ligamand adaptations that that the beneficial consequenses of resistance training which is driven by anabolic stimuli ye i've two questions about that the first one as something that you mention which is that the at the endrogens that tastasteron comes from the adrenals under resistance loats in women is the same true in men i men we hear that the tastis produce tastasteron when we waight train ev for for men that have tastis but am the do we know whether r not at the adrenals or the tasties and men that are increasing testasteron yar more both lobit from each tthe field is divided presently and inasmuch as understanding the acue adrin ththe acue and adrogen adronegic response in terms of ou no anabolic and response to exercise in an acute pase in the exposure to and stimulus that distress driven which might be partly from the adrenal glands partly from the gonads verses a longetunal exposure and to anabolic environments which is primarily driven by obvously the gonadis in e release the endicant environment from from tastostron release at the gonads this that the field is spliintens of how exercise is promoting hypertrophy o muscle tissue growth and whether that is very much ean adrenals and stimuli or if that significant enough in these acute responses verses the longetunal exposure just elevated basel levels of af anabolic tattastostron habitual level sones i can muscet with mosings as pride bowth by th inatrain at an e gonads ye and then you mention that a tastastron can have a inhensing of faxts or growth of faxts on tenden an ligament also that you do not often hereabout that people always think you tastasteron muscle but testoceron has a lot of effects on other tissues that are important for performance it sounds an ye y wae not absolutely min i thinking of the the the testostron homon is e a may listen as andogen receptors on a norl tissue on norlaxon prerty much everywhere exactly it the the binding capasti testostron and influence in different tissues within the body a tuchedon in a mustle tissue but the the the ligaments tetendens am even bone to to some extand in a testostron is is ptential to influence thats a iintends of removing osto peni canicharacteristics ec cetera and yet's it is a it is a a magic amagic homon let us a and with many a many and and in panxs intends valatation i difflen when to get back to your trajectory but as long as we are on a the inner actions between androgens testostron and its terivatives and different tissues you from the work that you did as a pht student and on and throughout your career could you say that there is a there' some general principles of training that favor testostron production in terms of that the that somebody who is not in a lad athle could use somebody who is already adapted to weight training somewhat they know btthe diffence re tinin to dum bell in a barbell an they know they know the various movements than i can a damage themselves but once ther doing that i mean i've heard shorter sessions are better than longer sessions but in rep loads wit not there is a lot of perameter space but if you were ging to throughout some of the om the perameters that you think are most importan to pay attention to for the typical person who ise trying to use weight training to build or maintain muscle ye lose body fats or body recomposition and or stay strong and healthy for sport o a different kind yes o the work that we oa sean i was a exposed to bacimapias te and iit was a double egisod in as much as testostron is really stimulateed by an intensity facta and also volume fact now growth homon is limit different that is logi driven by an intensity factor alone oh really i reslot the growthromon was driven my volume wut just goes to show you myve no no no no i think your progra woic just gos to showing that most of what is out there on the inner ande ris completely ri not only not only is it wrong its usually backward no trust i iiliint no trust or nothnat because because i think people just make this stuff up ight because it is very hard to measure grow throwon intostostrone and aand i'm cannot imagine most of the the stuffed i see out there theyr taking trips an and ou kno measuring free verseis bound in all this conirstop but tht's what you do and in laboratorae kno you look a total composition that oe look how much to that is free ot in the systemomuchis bound and that for biologically active bound to recepto tratin ralatation ad but yat coming back to testostron in ins of the training stratigis it is logi driven by bost an intensity ana volume factit if you look ot many of the exercise into ventions hat we use to try an investigate an interrogate testosteron and it was it was usually a six by ten protoco you touching a tout by ten meaning yet six sets of ten repetitions which is inthat is quite large and sity repetitions is quite large volume for a single exercise and that was usually piched about eighty per sen in tensever one repetition maxintensity o ges eighty per cent of the one ret ma six six sets of ten raps separated by rest of by two menute two ments which is actually pretty fast y at least to me it any don you titi the thro the three minutes when your acchy watching the clark it as too many respirites go by pretty fast by the third fourth sat ye you din for mo e and i thinkyou know we you k wwe formulated that kind of exercise proto call to really targe yo that the release of testostrone and trying drive up these anabolic environments to study the of the endecrin and you consequenceis but a think that is that is that is the type of protocola is mut most advantageous for driving anabolic environmand that was it for the work out yes we we would do that in a backscotso in a multi join and you challenging exercise multimuscle multi join eighty per cent loads of evye one repetition maxin than six by ten we did play round with you classic german volumntype ten by ten and can of protocalls and but they were just unsustainable at that eighty percen the the key to what we also did was we always adjusted and the loads to make sure that it was ten repetitions that wer sustained if the load was too too high and an athle or participan adto a drop the weight on on the six repetition we would unload the bar make shore they completed the ten ricions bring me back to the point of its an intensity ana volume derevetive that that is gon o be most advantageous for testostronerally thare's really interesting and one thing that you mention there is especially interesting to me which as you said when you go from six resets of ten repetitions to ten sets of ten repetitions you it is not as beneficial an mighty even be counter productive but to me the diference between six and ten sets as only four sets it does not even sound that much that of hints at the possibility that the thresholds for going from a work out that increases tustastrone to work out that diminishes tustastrone is a shy a pretty narrow morigin ye and i think it comes back to that intensy factto then what what we saw wit that ten by ten protocal really sees pretty significant drop offs in the load an and again we trying to stimulate with intensity with mechanical strain through intensity as well as metobolic strain through volume and i think that is that is the paradime that you got a lookat is that the mechanical load has to come from that the vo the atal weight on the bar and the volume and is is the metobolic stimulus how much e we driving lak ta how much we driving yiu a glycagenolosist in i in terms of that type of energy sistem for and yo executing a ten by ten protocolun what we often sa was just a significant reduction in the intensity capabilities of evan athl y to sustain that we shortend the volume and to tryin maintain the intens ity interesting and you could amagn just taking very long rest keeping the session being a big lazy bearer in rie training i sometimes do this i tolmyself himen to work out for forty five menutes and then two hours later i'm done but not because i was hoffing in puffing the whole time but because i was training really slowly a there any evidence that training slowly can offset some of the negative effects of doing a lot of volume well it is the old aded yif to two responses to question i mean the first one i would say ou now there is a difference between ten sets of six and six sets of ten and and i think that comes back to the volume conversation you knw six sets of tn is driving up metabolic stimulus and if if you do in ten sets of six you can probably take it to hirer intense to be not gan to get the same metablic load you knot get to get the same internal metabolic environment the drives te lactate release that they will lend signal ou know further anabolic testoster an release because of the lactate in your body and that that that is a key consideration the rest is often the consideration that is overlooked and out there in general population in many sporting environments that the rest is is as important a programm invariable as the load an the intens the intens ty the loads hat the volume et cetera and and yes if you remove if if you extend the volume if you extend the the duration of your rest periods what you are ultimately doing is influencing that metabolic stimulus again you are allowing the flushing of the body the removal of waste products lactates to be removed vi from from the body and then the the metabolic anvironment is reduce do want if i vinershin correctly you want ta create a metabolic aslyso the way that i've been training slow and lazy is not necessarily the best way to go i could i could in theory do a forty five or sixty minutes session were i packin more more work per unute time i'm not can be able to coudn't qua perform as well i will not be able lift us much nafter unye unwait the bar between sats or mave youven during setsof i have some one who could do that but it sounds that is the way to go is shuld be this you old addage of high intensity short duration is prombably the way to go correct enlaymen's terms if the same objective the same training goll is just muscle tissue growth and were not talking about maximal strins or any of those type of priments is who just talkng about growing muscle if there is an afply a in the du six six sets of ten with two minutes rest an thes atly be that does six sets of ten with three minutes lat rest afully a will likhely see the highest muscle gan muscled high perchapy gains because of the metabolic stimulus that the driving with the shot to restpers interesting for all the years that i've spent exploring exercise science and trying to get this information from the nrnet in various places that thiis the first time it is ever been am told to me clearly basily i need to put my ego aside and i need to not foca much on getting as many raps with a given weight and keep the rest restricted two minte about two minutes yet get the work in and then i'll derive the betrofits i mean you have obsolute niled it to bonistand again if you think about human nights ou nd how we approachd were in herently lazy ri as as as as humans we want to ou know we want to tay that rest one to take the the time out to recoveran feel refreshed bots we tryn to cry a trining stimulus wi tryni cry a very specific stimulus internal to the body an not is often driven by the metobolic environmen at that moment in time now if we allow the meticobolic environment to change by stending the rest periods we not going to see is as beneficial gans at the end of it very interested it it is at it is very much e mot to vitional and ego thing and rathen san ok i'm going to push my loads as high as a conond really challenge maximal strind to do fewe repetitions take long appearid to times ti completely different approach to trining its a different and gull interesting you mention lactate it seems o still bit controvers sal as to what aculy triggers hyperchephy you her about lackda build up or people that the common languages the muscle gets torn and then repairs but i do not knotice the muscle actually tear i'm in mi cro gan microchon and inseroption o e an o the mi within the muscle ticu interesting and and we are talking now about non druggassisted peoplers whose it less to say ia let us defind our terms here are that whose testostron levels are within the the the range of somewhere between three hundred and fifteen hundred or whatever twelve hundred because it does seem that athlets who take hih levels of exogonis andregens can do more work and just get proaching synthesis from jus doing work i've seen these guis in the cim rit the tut that hi'll tell scigns are not that hard to spot where they are just doing al a tono volume not tosearly moving that much weight there jus springi blood into the into the tissue and then the're loading up on their eating a ton approacing presume because they are basy an puberty part fifteen riht either on their fifteenth round of puberty where during puberty you are approaching synthesis machine iam that is to me that that is a you pretty clear about pubery interesting and then am you in terms of a because i know the audience likes to try protocall t you describe to protocall very nicely what about data day recovery em and can the work out heyou described as intense but short how many days a week can the typical person do that and sustain progress ym in a thing that comes about to trining age in yo trin history obvousy there is a rasilians and a robustness with with an incremental trining age an ow that is not appro to call at advise any one to go out and sto to morrow the' ben having them off the guraclor but at the same time insolso relative writes a ighty persend yn o ve if y maximum ata young tryin an ageis sdeligty persen vas is and i've been tryin in ten years it is sdelight yo pesend but yes the mechanical load is going to be ignificant you is just more tunage rive and but yet i think a prodical that weould look at two two times you a week something that is tat pretty in tensive that because again it comes bats o the point you make is you really need to be for one a better term suffering a little it throug that type of pro to call both in terms of afe the challenge of the load but also been able to tolerate than ma the matobolic strats that your exposed to it sid sir it is in our bit of a sick o feeling i because the lacktate the u tripeing up ou a i woln't promot as an athlete doing that type of modality you kno multibole multi times unless you rere from the realms of body building and then you really that that is the sole purpose of of what y trying to achieve most athletes and in most sports ave diverse requirements in turns ofoutcomes at the trying to achieve they are not just tageting muscle growth and muscle growth is a a conjuer to increase stran thincrease power ad increase speed ovously yes trying to get big a crosssacts iand larear of a muscle means that we can produce more force into the ground or or wherever it may be for a locommotive athly but usually sports men and women are not just purely seeking muscle growth and they they they look for different fasets of muscle and jurance or must maximole muscle power and muscle strantin us o then you got a be very crative in how you build the work out if it is a body bilder absolutely the chase in muscle growth and they gon a duce with these types of pro to cause which sees hiintensities in the high volumes of work load and on a pretty regular basis if it is just somebody an ou a weakcen warrior that wants to keep in shape and lok and loo good i would say two times a week for a really challenge in work out that and then flecks the other types of work outs within the week to have more of a a volume emphasis where you reduce the intensity in you might just look er larger reck ranges from twelve to fiftinto twanty another work out way you looking a you a reduce in the volume but increasein th intensity n really tran a drive you k a different stimula to give you more an points of af of success great nother that really informative am along the lines of endrogens end am intensity when i think intensity i think apenaferin a dranoon and a since you have a background in a catecolomians in tastasteron last time i was i hear at to yoursey performance institu we had a brief conversation and i i want to may shrike at the details right that in the short term in a big increase in strasrormon can lead to an increase in testasteron a a perashute johmp cram but that stras can promote the release of tustastrom yet that was news to me ram we always hear about stress suppressing tastasteron stra suppressing the imions as to all these terrible things but in the short term you are saying it can actually increase the release of tustasteron a i have that right crouke end then the second question is does my cognitive interpretation of the stresser make a difference in other words if i voluntarily jump out of a plane with a parachute does it have a different effect on my tustastron than if you shovfor me out of the plane against my will what presume bly with a parachute right to i mean this was what all my piach t work was was looking at was the and that the a pr and th the exposure to a stresser and the prearousal of how your body essentially prepares for that stresser and then how it manages it throughout the exposure to the stress and it was uctually motivated from paraschute jumpers to there was an older study and looking at parachute jum fors into into into combat and and that they were study in the carters all a stress response and the epinefan response of these parachte jumpers we we got us thinking about hold on you the certain work out that you do that just the daunting it sik okait squat squats aterday or whatever may be iut myg gash this is going to be a is going to destroy me twe are af to talk to this person i do not wanta talk to nowwhat right i mean tonlthing youor pihte disseretation axam or sing an you have been public speaking o whateverit be now wwe we used an exercise we used te resistance training protocol that woud that these athletes knew wuld was going to be very very challenging it is going to be that is going to have some anxiety to doing it the knew ther wre ging to be some physical distress from doing it and and therefore yu know them then mind set of how they were ging to approchstat was already set all we saw prietfifteen minutes prietothe start of an ex exposure to to the workout that the epinefer in the nordranling the dranling was already stying to prepare the body sim pathetically and to goin to what it knew was going to be a very very challenging workout that brings you back to exercised preparation competition for certain preparation and preparation for certaint competition excuse me and your pre work out routines the use of music and all ays different things that we know can now youn anecdotally in the jim we put into place but you the day to i presented to showed that it was the first of its kind to show that this link between and epineperin and and nor up anefan release an arousal and then consequent performance forse output throughout the a throughout the work out was intimatelyly what is it whatwas to take away there should is it a beneficial for people to get a little stress about the upcoming in pending event whether or not it is il liftin the gim or whether not i's talking to somebody that you might be intimidated to talk to or a a an exam what is it is the stress good for performance or is at harmful yen i think that is a great question and i think i can only talk to physical exertion which is what we were we were were exploring an in our do not want to trad on the tos of the psychologists with flosstate in these types of things because clearly i think you are in the the position of scientific trone this one i think you have the laverage ao i mean mo en ivall our friends in that community is i'll just say as as a buffer to to your the answer youre about to give that there is there is very little science around am flow an tere's very little nor science relate to mos psychological states anyway i think we have got a lot of degrees of freedom here breathi aryiaa i'll tak o i'll be anything you credit duncan anything you dislike sensend them in commence to me i ye thing for from fom my dates to certainly thet the greater te rousal the high o the performance was from a from a physical exertion perspective and i thing that was the intriguing part of some of my findings with thas definitely a bok an individual biocanetics to some of thes and homon ol kind of release is in as much as those guides that had the highest and you agina responsintems of epinefran release nor apinefan release also sustained folse outputs and through for a long of peerd of the workout than those that did not that the the individuals ats at a lowe and stimulus of of the simpathetic arousa let sa and certainly did not perform as well throughut the work now the intriguing thing then becomes is oka and i think this this me really psyguising to what what we doing here that with with combaathlis with mixmachalatists that there is a philosophy there is a paradime now from a solf intems of the exposure repeats exposing the the more you do that challenging workout do you get the same psychological stimulus dis ta get the same stress response and an and the sumption is unlikely you accommodate you become a custom to the strasa you body will leve or adapt and that is the classicovelo principal right and you then ne to take the strassa down a different rout buts and i think when you look a that the the athles that we wer with here and it is it is a fith fight at the end of the day tat's is nothing more stressful than tot but a thinkg just the exposure to the rigu is of training to understand the bad positionis the bad situations to know that they can get out of certain situations out of certain submission halds or whatever it may be i think that really ties in with some of my pex d working tims of what these guides do to approach what is you really challenging sportne rener in mixmachalats yets deponly the extreme of what is possible in terms of asking does stress favor or hinder performance am because at yn you sat the end of the day it is some one trying to hurt you as much as they possibly can within the bounds of the rules and you are trying to do the same that is you i find tat your theastis work fascening were were you never to be it the a you have see performance institute luckily they made the right choice and brought you here am but were you never to come here i is still fascining by this because over and over we heare that stresses bad stresses bad stresses bad but everything i read from the scientific literature is that stress an epineferin in particular it is coupled to the tustosterone response to performance and to adapt tion provided it does not go on too long i'm unless i'm saying something that violates a i mean thaand that is your works at ae really ia'm important and beautiful work and i i refer to it oftens i'm just glad tat i i'm thkwe could bolt that down because i think the people mean to know this that that discomfort is beneficial now there is a there is another side to this i'm that i want to ask about which is i'm the use of cold i'm im particular things icebas called showers or i any other type of a cold temperature exposure in theory that stress also it is apineffering and i'm how should one think about the use of cold for recovery if it' stress how is if stress if colds causea stress then how is cold used for recovery that is what i do not understand in maybe just one of charior thoughts on that yet no nd i think thiy it is a great question and i think the the jurio still out there certainly and knowing some of the conversations that we we have been haveit but i think ou knw when woeu tok out stress it is you classic fit fliht or frees a proach and and youve throwing your body into a a col tob a ice bath or whtever it may be and certainly is going to have a physiological stress response now people use in that for different and an guls and againg i think that is where the narrative has to be explained an if you are use in the stress specifically to manage the mind sets and to use it as a specific stress stimulas that is the same as me doin sixby ten eighty percent you you just trying to find something to disrupt the system to do something that is very and if one a better to painful discomfort whatever and you just finding a stresser and then been able to manage the mind set but if you using cold and specifically from a physiological perspective to promote and redistribution o vascularit of blood's flod yo t to different vascularareas of af muscle that that you feel have gone through work out that at damage tor whatever t may be i think there is we have got to understand what that stress mechanism is and and the the date of the literature is certainly still out there with respect to criotheropean col baths and some of these and your high thes discold exposures intems of what theyd do at at the level of the muscle tissue if that is if that is the tager if you trind to promot a flushing mechanism or you trying to promote redistribution of of the blood flow what you have got understand is that cold is going to clamp down every par of the vascular system and and we have really got to understand how the muscle would be redistributed and two areas of interest you i think thi stress response is is is is a real thing with respect to yo cold exposure an but i think the narrative round what are you using the cold for has to precede the conversation because yes it is it it is put your hand over a a hot coals you o that that distresss the same way as jumping in the coal bath is and i think must people do not realize that you gin to get the upan afrin release from holding your hand up to clostolu lam you can get up from getting in the ice bat you body does not know the difference a you body does not know the difference it is a prione a a a primordial kind of physiological response that it is crated over millions of millions of years and i think that that is a that physiology is is not changing and it is it is fixed in a particular way right now and that that it does not understand the difference between whether it is six by ten doin a challenge in work out of year whether it is put my hands on the hot coal whether's a liance stood in front to me o whatever that epineph in response from the the level of the brain down to the the whole signalling cascade is is the same in cold i've heard can actually prevent some of the beneficial effects of training that it can actually get an getting the way of muscle growth et cetera ye this tus tas some pretty robusdates arout there now showing that it id definily has an influence on performance variables stranth and power in particular and but absolutely instends of muscle hypertrophy and there is a big kind of theme in in the world of athletic performance right now instens of puradization of cold exposure as as a recoveryg madallitintial what whendy use cold should yo be usin cold for recovery in periods of high training load when you'r actually pursuing in it mig be general propratric proparatry work we asty tryng to pursue muscle growth well that is usually way you get the most sor it is usually were you feel the most fatigue but it is probably not the most beneficial approach to use an ice bath in that in that cenario because you dampening you dulling the eend of the amtor pathway and and the the hypert hypotrophic and signaling pathway whereas in a competition pase where atually quality of exercise and quality of execution of skill and technical work has to be maintained you want to throw the kitchen sink of recovery a capabilities in recover into ventions in that cenario because you now yo that the muscle building activity shoulle be in the bank that should have bein done in that in the general preporat poparatry work an and now you pocusin on technical execution you are absolutely right tut interesting fight f in rshim correctly a if if i want to maximise muscle growth or power it were improvements an adaptations then the inflammation response tho the lade on set muscle sor in us all the stuff that is uncomfortable and that we hear is terrible as actually the stimulus for adaptation and using cold in that situation might short circuit my progress but if i'm i do not know ht all ever do thas s but if i were to to an iron man or something or run a merithon under those conditions i'm basily coming to the to the ra s to speak with all the power and straingth i 'm going to have and they are a reducing inflammation is good because it is can allow me to perform more work assentionally absolutely yet you have to be strategic about when youuse some of these interventions and the the time when you preparing for a conpetition is not the appropriate time a excuse me it is the appropriate time when you want to drive recovery and make sure that your body is optomized and when you are far away from a a a conpetition you date or outs of season and whatever it may be and you are really tranagist tear up the body a little bit to allow it to it is natural and yu know healing and adaptation process is to take place wer you do not want to negate that yyou know that you want the body to oght to minds its internal recovery and that is how mustle growth is gan a happens interesting that there is a time can of consideration that ou un to make with these interventions for sor at te your see performance aner of tha or the fider is periodizing the recalled exposure where they just you doing cort called at at at will well it is not just you eve see and again i talk about my personal experiences with different sports i think just education around wer sciencs taand or under standing of a concepts the use of cold exposure for recovery ice bath t everyone wants to jumpin an ice bathbut think as we have as we have stepp back and scientists of start to say av a stad to figure out and look at some of the dater wwere now more intuitive about well attually that might not be the best or the most optimal approach and i think that is that any given sport yes certainly hear tha you have see were trying to educate our athletes around appropriate timing and it is the sayime with nutrition is the same with an ice bath intervention is the sayme with lifting waight is the sayme with going for a run or working out on the back the that there is the tactics to when when you do things h when you do not do things and i think sstress and and cold exposure and we have to have a consideration round that as well but it is not just you kno ema may fihtes that is any any athaly and i think it is that the best the best professionals the most successful professionals do that really well they unders they listen one they the educate themselves and then they build structure and i think you knw th the most o leat level we always talk about it here ther you have see but the most ofly level you not necessary training harder than anybody else everybody in the you ae see trains hart every one is training superhart but the best athletes that the true a leat levels are the ones that can do it again and again and again on a daily basis and sustain a technical out put for skill development therefore their skills can inprove or physical development that physical attributes can improve that ability to reproduce on a day to day basis falls in to a recovery conversation now when is the right time to use some to make anice bathand when is an is part of the the high performance conconversation for sour s really the scientists the rebuilding structure af theyer figuring out variables ye but it sounds the uability to do more quality work over time is is one of the keever i'm in its fundamental i mean gobagin gobage out quality in quality out but in our sport in a i talk about in a mixe machelots it is truly a decafalon of combat there is many different attributes whether's a grappling whether's a restling whether it is the transition were whetherit is to stand up striking tha the different facets of a training program in this sport ah significantly large compared to something and a wide receive in football that is no disrespect for whye receivers but they run routs they they the going to run o raut o a aa passentry and that is all the ned to do these guides have to be on the ground the god be ground the groundthe got to be great standing up the got to be great with the fita the back against the fence the theres many different canofacets tol our sport managing the distribution of all the training components is one of the biggest challenges af mixe machelots and the best guises get that rights they they allow their body to to optimise the training and remember why why are we doing train and we doing training for tat technical and tactical improvement now if you if you body is fatigued or you just come expose yourself to mor tactical development or technical development then essentially doing self a his service you gon to be behind the curve with rewith respect to those guis that can reproduce that day and day out on the topic of a skill development regardless of sport a we hear all the time and it certainly is o tuitive to me that the person who can focuss the best well progress the fastess but's come of interesting somethin as i talk to ath leats in am they seem a a little bit laid back about their training sometime it is and yet they obviously know how to flip the switch an they can really youtile in the intensity do you think that there are optimor proter calls for skill learning in terms of physical skill learning but could it ever be perameterize the six sets of ten raps an this gets to the heart of narrow plasticity which is still it is not a black box but it is kind of a a black box with aportions of it illuminated i to to say but know what your thoughts on skill development is there for somebody that wants to get better at sport a do you recommend a particularly long or short training session it does intensity matter was it just raps ye think it now it is it is not a volume driven exercise it is a quality driven exercise and list and ma my expatigeis not in mot to learning and mot to skilla quisition nd i attend to default to gabdoc to gabrial wulf her youn al vifefit and for that she is one of the leading proponents in this area buts if if you look out and os true skill development it is about rehearsal of accurates movement accurate movement mechanics and and the soon as soon as that becomes imp acted by fatigue or inaccurate movement you now losing the the the motor learning you losing the accuracy of the skill that yo people coan call it muscle memory o whatever the want right but essentially groving nural axons to to cray movement patens and ther situational throughout sport righta whether it is a croifturnin succer or a jump shottin basket ball or a forehand down the line you can carve out that peticular posture in position and skill and you can isolates it and you can drill it anagain and again again ias soon as fatigue is is influencing that repetition it is time thes time to stop and the best coach is understand that they understand that it is quality of a quantity when it comes to skil acquisition to answer yo question in around about way iw's say yes it it is it is it is shorto sessions that a very high quality and i think the best athletes in my experience to the one's it qonsciously and cognitively ire aware of it every moment of the training session they should they should leave the training session not necesrily just physically fatigue but mentally fatigue because their completely engaged in the learning process the the problem then becomes o ka if we just do lots of you kno thirty minute sessions we got to do a lot of thirty minute sessions to get the volume exposure of the repetition and the rehearsal of the skill again and again and again the bit of a paradox it is a bit et of a double ege sort but at a three hour session versis a ninety minute session ow wllt we will take the ninety minute session any day when it comes to skill acquisition because that is gon to be driven by quality of a quantity training and skill learning is incredibly mentally fatiguing i've often wondered why when one works out hard when that is with your ron or with the weights why it is hard to think later in the day yet if really there really does seem to be something to it and i've wondered is it depletion of a drennlin dope mean i sometimes think it is might be dople me and here i'm totally speculating i ave any daydos support this but if you hid a really hard work out or run early in the day oftentimes the brain just does not want to do hard mental work which gives me great admiration for these athletes that are drilling their mind in body all all day every day with braks but what r your thoughts what what it what leads to the mental fatigue after physical performance well again i do not wont a talk out in om talkin that to the man hern o this wet were we are just two side i speculaing on on this point up untill now we have been a you have been giving us concrete am a pure of yeud study base feed back on the my questions but but if wewere to speculator i think this is a common occurrence people thing if i get that really good work out in in the morning i feel better all day perhap's true unless that work out is is really intense or really long and then you just the mind just somehow will not watch on to mental work quite quite as well i amin just philosophically and i think this h this is a coming back to this connostress consideration ou i a a public speaking ot taking a exam mei meang if you are if if if you have an amazing coach you as setting o training in a particular why it is challengin it there is the strain relates it to it i'm not toking physical strin i'm toking figuring things out on o figuring ou the skill and i think that can be stressful the learning process can be stressful a you now weve tuch om stress i also think if they if they if if the hit the rigt technique that reward center in the brain that dope mean shot is is going a fly up there and there is only many times that we can get that before that becomes damp and and i think there is an energetic piece to it you kow there is the fueling of of the brain there is the the is the the the cabhydrate fuelin exercise the atually the stracegy round how you fuel ful learning and fuel for physical training it is atually pretty similar les yet it is it is plucos it sugar at the end of the day right and ye ar you are you fueling accordingly around you training sessions be that very physical caus everyone thinks ki you kni'm going to jump on the treadmen i'm ging a bang out fifteen sprints tha maxef and i'm going a bu be droping off and lying on the floor at the end of it any to refuel wet what about the refueling of the brain in a very demanding a exercise or drieling session why you looking a technique that yi tran o figure out this very challengin for your mind to figure out it the complexity of it ut still needs to be fueled or refueled afterwards and i think that is ofisty imight be in erey whe athleates do themselves a disevis i not appropriate fueling from what might be consider to be a lower in tensity session but the that they the cognitive challenge has been significantly high they are doing skill work or drea work and it is taxing the brain ever everythingk ing oh i was not pushing hard left sor ore doing sprints and i can just go off the rest my day but then they'r they'r their mind is drifting ye yoome i speculate yethats a things very reasonable i mean i know that i'm hure end presumely wit the other athlets you have worked with a nutrition is a huge am aspect of that and i think the general public can learn a lot from athletic nutrition because it at the end of the day the general public is trying to attend to their kids attend tof their work whether otheir lawyers or whatever am they need to focus a nutrition is a barbed wire topic oh ye whi i if i since we are free to i do what we would do if weere just sitting in each other's offices which is to just a speculate a bit it for the typical person i do you think these am low carbohydrate diets a typical person who exercises run swims yoa liss waits maybe not all those things but some collextion of those is pushies themselves to do those things and to do them well but is not nesserly highly competed athly do you think that a nutrition that does not incl uda lot of glucos does not include a lot of carbohydrates an is a problem or is it o k and what yo what ye recommend for athletes what he recommend for topical people yea cain disclaim i'm not a dieticion and but i i dot get the dieticians do not know what to reman nos either and i say that from having spend a lot of time with the literature now it is a complete ramas it is i thought we did not understandanything about the brain the neutrician science stof is all over the place rigt i think we have again i go largar easy freeder rr i mean i thinking o i think it is it comes down to metabolic efficiency nd we would neve we would never advocet a h i never say never ca but we rarely advocat a high performance athle in a in a hintense the intirmatan port mama and being told a qeytogenic or e do not recommend no because it then o the day some of those high intensity efits and usually require o cabahydrate fueling and for the iam and the energy and the energyes produced tat those high intensities we try to navigate roun not now ther listen ther our fightes in the ou ave see and and elsewhere mat brown is a great example and who o promotes the qetogenic approach and it works for him but wwe we look at the science and the nat to the characteristics of asportan we do not neselly promote that can i interrupt you rook with what about qeitones for people that are ingest in carbohydrates this is an interesting ary because people always here qeytones and they think will have to be qeytogenic to benefit from taking qeitones rethere a number of athletes and am recreational athletes now as well taking liquid or powder based qeytones on even though they do in eat rice an o meal and bread and other things as are there any unknown benefits of qeytones even if one is not in a state of qeitosis the the the and the the only the the use of qeitones am primary where of is is and in our sport is after the event near nin tens of the brainhealth with with athle said taking a patentially taking troma to the brain et cetera and looking to maintain t at that the fueling and the energy supply to the brain but yes it is probably about my remit i i do not want talk on that because i'm not not fully familiar with that wha for the qeitones am after head injury can provide a buffering comrigts not in a reverse brain damage but it might be able to offset some of the microdame right that that is what that is how we use it just to sustain and near the energy supply to the brain that might be compromise through brain troma and that is why we use qqeitones and to come bout the original question if it is in a general population then yes i think thas there is a place to argue the atually been on a qeitogenic diet times and may be thats to cycln etsocises may be not i do not mean cycling o bycomin cycling and quitosis and is beneficial because i think it is goin a lead to betomatobolic man angemen and an and metabolic efficiency at those lower intensities where we should be fueling our our metablism with lipids and fats and clearly the the western det and and oun o the monday diets is heavily driven by process food and cabahydrates the people become predisposed to utilization of that fuel sauce and above lipid use fat use and intensities thatare very low some obou datto with the fytis shows a as well and but to think the challenge foruses that were working with ae clian tell the requie hintensity bouts of effort and you kno fueling appropriately and it is very impornat for that now we use we use tactics here where we essensially have athletes on what you would say canava is it a lagia keytogenic diets but then we will fuel cabahydrates a round training sessions we will do very timed exposure to cabahydrates it is n host training post training immediately fre during and then immediately post and then the rest of their diets on of breakfast luncheon dinner a what would look keetogenic type approaches we trying to be very tactical in exposures to maximize the intensity for the training and and then return to a metabolically efficient diets which is heavily reduced in cabahydrate because we fueled the the the sessions it needet i'm smiling because a once again the this place that youar se perform in center is doing thing scientifically which to me the idea and an u please to hear that because to me thats idea that the keetogenicdiet is the best and only diet or carbohydrates and a low protingdites or the best it its just it is ludicrous then you mention metabolic efficiency think am some people might be familiar with that term some perhaps am not but the way understand metabolic a efficiency is that you you teach the body to use fats by maybe doing long long bouts of cordio may be lowering carbohydrates a bit teaching the body to tap into its fat stores for certain periods of training and then you also teach the body to utilized carbohydrates by supplying carbohydrates immediately after training him before training you teach the body to use keytones and then you use them at the appropriate time as appos to just deciding that one of these fuel sources is good and all the others or bad or dispensable do i have that correct youve nil o immer from a a bobsi ba is b formerly of ousay trathlon and is is the ga that cantacame up with the tthe concept of metabolic efficiency but yes your absolutely rites o mean a low intensities of exercise or just day to day living we should not be tapping in to our and cabahydrte fuel sauce is extensively that that is that is for hier intensity work or the fhites of fli needs of estress and if you no athletes or any individual has a ahi caba ydrate diet the ganestat to become predisposed to utilizing that fuel sauce preferentially now a low intensity that can be problematic certainly for anathly because if they preferentially use cabahydra a lower intensities when they when they exercise te man goes to a higher intensity they have already exhausted the fuel staws an o the cant draw upon fat because the oxidasation of that that faties just too slow they'e essentially now become fatigued and because of devorty utilise the cabahydrate staws what we try to do yes through diet manipulation and a little bit of exercise manipulation is as ye say teach the body o train the body to preferentially use a specific fuel sas fat of tisy a lower intensities in cbahydra a high intensities and welook at specifically the cross of a point between the too tells a lo intens of howanathly is is ultimately an how the matobolism is working bu again i smiling because i love this because it is grounded in something real and scientific which is that we have these different fuel sources the body can adapto us any number of them are one of them and thing most people are looking for that one pattern of eating that one pattern of exercising that can o be best for them or sustain them and they often look back to the time when they felt much better switching from one thing to the next but the adaptation process itself is also key right teaching the body and i im soif we were to i'm just riff on this tirtelobit further if if somebody i'll use myself as examples and a a can only am speculate what other peoples a current nutrition protor calls ar but if somebody is eating in a particular way and they want to try this kind of peridization of nutrition im could one say o ke o for a few weeks i'mone to do more high intensity interval training and wait training an i'm an eedle bit more carbohydrate cause i'm to pleading more glikagon then if i switch to iv fase of my training where im doing some longeruns maybe i'm not maybe i'm training less maybe i'm just working at my desk lo bit more then i might switch to a low lower carbohydrate do do not have that right and then if i'm goin enter a competition of some sort certainly not you have see er m i a of any kind to be clear a not because it is not a wonderful sport bu because it is that would not be good for my other profession but im if i were going to do that then i would think about stacking corbohydrates keytones and in facts as that don'i have that i'm anything ything ye you jst said it eloquently at the end of the day you consciously understanding what the and the exposure to to physical exertion is and yeuflectsing you diet accordingly ni thik it i's the need based eating exactly and iv fone of editons an e call it whatever fancy terminology there is out there but yes it is it is needs baste eating nd but youre very conscious and cognesan of what is my current exercise status tam and if i'm taking some time off then oun do not goge on the cabahydrahts we probably need to be cut it is gon to be lower intenity work or even just habit ual dit to day walking round u negroseries that that does not require massive amounts of glycogin storage an an an ancabahydrate befueling and you can petensi to go mor keetogenicin nitye and you now oxidizein lipids for that fuel and if you are in a high period of of hih intensity training then youhave to consciously flects you diet to support that that is not normal yeve you have made a a change of elevated the demands the fueling requirements for the regenitr not only fuelin the exercise wit the regenitary o requirements of you body after that type of work is gun to be really im port as well yes tycon mocabahydrates i think it is consciously interpreting the nigthof eu die against what theway you are any moment in time that you ow that think i'm the listeners of my pacast generally are experimentors y are scientists of themselves weum which makes me happy obviously and and and i to think that ther paing attention to the changes their making and how they are effecting themselves and they seem more open to i'm trying things pory they can do it safely in u and and seeng what works for them and i'm certainly in a try some of the chang shop i also really a creature of habit and i think the a talking you to day i realize on problly doing a number of thingis truly wrong in my training but also that i do not tend to very a my nutrition with my training quite as much as i should i'm just locked into a protocall we are we cover a number of things related to your pcthisis work and then but i cut you offerly on related to your a trajectory after you finish your thesis you i know you were a notrdame for while was that your first spot after after yourpchithisno no i yam ibasically finish mapiesty and i drops into the british alympic system for about fourteenia onas i as i was with them in i've done three full o lympic cycles and with different sports in lagi strength and conditioning coach and as a practitiona i was always working in in universities and academia alongside you knowintems of continueng to publish in riht and and do sercion teach as well that ext lains the or usy volume of public i do not think people realizeal of the work that goes into getting equality pure reviewed publication it is not of what what they callht now on inscrim anicadata where people do something what rehavetis experience and then they put in the world that tha anecdata are i only know that we gets recall it data but also fourteen years in the working with the britishall impecting yes with them whether it was gb box in primary with with the the riosa at accuse me the the baging cycl but also light waht roas and gymnastics and for the london olympic games that cycl i was with i was tha the leads fron the condition in a physical performs coach for british basket ball yobe basket ball and i had about three years and in the english primelegu and with with nucasi nitid an asocatin and and for the reo will inpixy colors with great bren tychondon o gan at another combat sport and after i'd finished there ie can have moved to univers in notradame and where i went into more of a more of a managerial position working across all the different tecnical services medical nutrition strand the conditioning in a sput psychology and whatever sport science whatever it may be and as the n the an director of performan sciences at for notrada mathletics and then after about sixteen months ther the you have see came aknocking an and they recruited me iave notradam a it is been a been a great right and lots of funavego lot lots of athletes have tauht me a lot along the whalors to coaches every day as the school day i i still trying keep that at mentality in in this world we call it white ben white belt mentality it ar nom a'mapigety have got twenty five years of experience in in high performance sport but an i still i still learn every single day from these people out on the mats and in the ring and its impressive to see what they do yet certainly as i i'd got introduced the ma majrs a few years ago i think that for summer came out here was one of the fortimes i ad heard of mama caue is cgave in my laboratory and you knows down a and it is a really interesting sport because in corporate many different types of movement as youresa youas not jastand a barxing its ad just kicking as ever youn ground game everything and i'm still learning about it am but it as you mention going in with that beginners mind the what white benment a white beltomentality am what w what as been the most surprising thing for you in terms of being exposed to emame in particular as pos to other sports ik what what is unique about ema ma fideres besides that they have this huge variety of a a tactical skills that they have to learning perofact yet that is a great question i would say two thiong can answer two questions one actually riterates what you have already said the degrees of freedom in mix marshall as or expenential no other sport ye weve got eleven different wheite classes we have men's classes have women's classes we have and kick boxes wrestlers jugits of fightes judokes carati fighters the stylistic backgrounds ar infinite and we have were aweite classification sport there is a whole iss ou relaitin to making wegte and then rebounding to to fight about twenty fourto thirty out just the veryability in this sport the the the considerations that you have to make or unprecedented compared to any of the sport aav wort wit and and a lot of them go against and thet are the antithesis of what you would expect for high performance in terms of we we do not always have a very clearly defined competition scedule you now once these guis fight that they do not necessarily kno and then next fightes cone to be what is the closes spacing of of a fight i mean liss an nithink thatthe record is around tan it i's just over a mon i believ youness an that that is a quick turn round but most of these guides ae fighting three or four times a year three times a year is is pretty normal and that tha the biger fights may be two times a year but invariably the guides do not know when that next date is going to be r in this gray area of oca what what what do we do ik co we wev taking some time off for we just can o do some general pret work or we goin to trying keep this inthe ou the nife sharpend in case i get i idn't realise us in that way it is a lot special operations absolutely you do not know when the coi and right they have to be ready at all times there is not this let us get ready for it ses r yett when when i was with the britih olympic association i knew is the the british open the spanish open the french open the europian champianships thes really open the american open the canadian open the olympic games i ya tork it in your rain riyyo on iyou dis plans where all the targets ae on to be ye it is a moving target because you might be just tingyin ou doing some general pret work and then you might get a short notice fight they give you quick corn since six weeks or five weeks and o car have got a ramp everything up really quickly that is a real challenge in terns of just managing all these this these different components oft mix martial arts and alone tht theother to combat you question the other thing which is truly fascinating about these individuals is there tust the mental raziliants and again it we we have touched on it in the talk but the ability to do what they do on a daily basis to and look at all the different skilcess that they have to try and engaging and and and bring in to their training to do that and and and embrace the grind and brace the process of just learning and the physical side of our sport is unprecedented and but the mental sides you we have funny sany we er say it to ninety percent medica at ninety prersent mental apart from the sixty percent as physical it is just it is just more and more and more and these these guides ability to and to just do that on a daily basis is is is is very impressive the brazilians ther they are internal drive in their razilians is is is really impressive to see all the firers a me here been really terrific its u interesting am every time i meet a fighter how often i a i should not be surprising whetheir often berry soft spoken or is extremely p e en fighting is such a it comes from a very primitive portion of the brain rightis a but a large portion of the brain you knon nout a thing that is another skill is that is which and again that is the recoverability piece right lik you cannot be ti pay or you cannot be supercharged twenty four hours a day because you' going o just fryer system in i think that is something else where wed really tryn o manage this whole process be it through nutricial interventions bet through education round sleep beit through and training pro program managemen and bet through psychological interventions you could look at fights and say these gudes are go the rediler and they the run through a brick war but atually again nd theire ability to turn it on an off means that they can do what they do they can bring it down and an be very nomal very plight very in a accommodates and maybe even better then most people because one o the reasons i'm obsess with with human performance and high performance and at people fighters an ex leat military or or even body builders for that matteris that they they experiment they find the outer limits of what is possible but one of the things that they have discovered is hour describing as disibility to toggle between high alert states and calm states most typical people cannot do this they see something that sets them on the inner net or something on the news or some external event pressures down on them and their stresse for many many days and weaks and sometimes it goes pathological right an and this i do not say this as a criticism it is just that most most human beings within our species most members of our species never learn to to either flip the switch orto just voluntarily toggle between states i think athletes learn how to do that extremely well and don it somes em mem may fighters do that even better than perhaps many other athletes mand yet ti is the out one of to that struggle with but a think in tims of that chronic exposit we we see and that comein from challenges around no syclical white cootsing and metabolic descruption an metabolic injury not necessary from the psychological drive nd they they do they do understand that this is a job for them an and the time on the masnl most of them can can turn off a little bet and and down griat things when they are off the mouts andits it is impressive to see because again as as lamen just looking and the fight gam you think in ight's gun to be crazy caltic a hundred miles an hour every hour of every day but an that is not let us clearly ot the case they they they yan manage their energy in their effits pretty well tis a lowe bit science although maybe scientistical take a lesson forye anevident i practice practice a tat i a a couple more questions i i cannot help myself i know we talk about temperature earli or andn we discuss col but i i cannot hep myself i have to ask you about heat because earlier we were having a a conversation about heat adaptation about how long does it take for a the human body ore athlete or typical person thats may be exploring san our things that sort to learn to be a better swetter sounds something no none of us would want to do we all want to sa cool comon collected but one of the reasons to deliberate expose oneself to heat is for things growth homon release et cetera we talk about this but am couple questions one is heat exposure stress in the same way that the ice bath or cold exposure estress second one is is there any difference there that is important and the other one is how does one get better at heat adaptation or at least what are you doing with the fighters to get them better at dealing with heat how long as that takes the first question just a cause i thro three questions a you is a was is heat stress cold distress ye think it is and i think he shot protins for example ar driven by that stressful exposure to a changin environment and think it is it we do grated responsinto of heat acclamation strategies and but yes we weve touch on earlir in the conversation for me heat is still a stresser and and if it is managed in correctly you can have detrimental responses rather beneficial responses warring hyprethermean dat coming ivese heat up the brain too much people wirl yes easures and i but on you loosin our aunts but ow what is the right way to acclame heat taking in to account that people sous to check with their doctor et cetera we do all these just claimers but you but let us ay i les should say i want to get better at dealing with heat or i want extract more benefit from heat is i mean how many minutes to day or people typically exposing themselves to heat how often in overha what periods of time yes we we we know n the start wit about fifteen minutes of exposure now if some one's really lacking acclamation to heat you can do that in three five minute efforts gen men and natchly is a his hots onor ye hot sono take time to step o hundred degrees or something coreters ye y ye two hundred fir and it yes andnd we we we try to work up to thirty to forty minutes to forty five minutes in the sorner continuous now we we have to understand what what is the advantage of hea acclamation for our athletes ultimately their ability to sweat and to lose you body fluids is going to be advantageous to their waiht cut process to their ability to make wit it is a technique that these gat some of these guids adopt if you do not have high sweat rates it means you would gon have to sit in the sorner for longer and longer and longer to get the same delter in sweat reles and the more acclamatad you are the more you body its the magemi genclly adapted the more sweatlands you have and the smorl pause you can sweat more and therefore you will lose that fluid quicker and he spend less time in the sorner that is why we do it and to tryind promow the the limp to limit the exposure and het comes bat t you first question is it astresser it is it absolutely to stresser if you have got a spend two hours in over ou over fore our period two hours of it sat in asorner ye is yo were the hona dozen work you can nowr i sous now you ougt tos worse than from the refon and that is a stresser in itself right noin yes o think there is the say you kno what we do is we anything we build up in temperature wih but we build up in en volume of exposure we start with fifteen minutes and then we justritto ad on a had on a cross e time and now now for us we can a found about fourteen and sorner exposures starts to really then drive that atations that were looking for it is not quick fix a hea acclamation strateghe has to happen long before ight week along before the fights this is a i's a process to has to begin in a eight or ten weeks before the fight that we cannot sty get the adaptation an tha tolerance to the strasa to the exposure of heat is interesting i until to day when we tare about this earlier and again now i did not realize that im but it makes perfect sense now that i hear it that heat adaptation is possible that your basy can train the body to become better at cooling itself which you yeu t what sweaning is i a i should have known that before but you do not see that in the texbooks and a im in listen it is it is it is the same as the keatogentic conversation and ye you train in your body to be moe bytametabolic efficion you train in your body to tolerate heat mo you training you but the body is e in a as an organism is an ooganic system it is it is hugely adaptable it is hugely plastic but a think the skill is understanding the wens the wise in the ware ofs in tems of changing the overlode changing the stimulus to drive specific adaptation and philosophically that is that is how we go about our work here we talk about adaptation led programming now adaptation led programming fits into every single categre not just lifting whites or running track it fits into nutrition it fits into sitting in the soner it fits into bein in a colbath or not it fits into many different things because we'e driven by scientific insights and and that is how we realy want to go out bo our business a lever a leathis concept of adaptation led programming and doing that notchust in the contects of you not throwing another plate on the bar or something that but in every aspect of of one's training and in performance and i think there is a lot here that is applicable to the recreational asth let too ye hwould you say that you what comes to mind is twelve weeks it feels twelve weeks as a nice block of time for some one to try something in terms of to try something new adsee how they adapt adapt and then may be switch to something new i realize that it is very hard to throw a kind of pin im time traim around something but in terms of if some one wanted to experiment with heat adaptation or experiment with call tadaptation or change up their training regiment or or diet and a look at metabolic efficiency do you think i'm twelve weeks as a good period of time to really give something o thorough go and get and unget gain an understanding of how well or how poorly something works for oneself or would you say it is enough for three i min at's that is tha how long is a piece of train kand of o eonsrit iman yes if if we would just token albitry recreational expran laby three months exposure twelve week training a strategy try at twelve we intervention i's is more than adequate to say it for ninety nine percent of things that change within the body that physiologically adapt to a training stimulus or novlod stimulus you gon a stot to see ithe regression all progression and in a beneficial or detrimental effects within three months absolutely io unsihself now listen to i say that in as much is we do training blocks here that three weeks lat ray no what is it that is because of this constraint that sometimes people suddenly have to they get the call to fight correct yes oits supercondensed and nin that in that sonary were always conscious of is a body is their body or and this individual do they have the ability to tolerate that superoverlowd that supercondensed exposure now we might be doing that purposefully we might be trying to do an overreaching strategy where we really trannin damage or flect something and i do not mean negatively damage but lie we tran a damage tissue to greally get in ataptive response verses more drawn out twelve weeks stratigy which is more chere and more planned out more structured in nature but and yet for all you listeners i would say if twelve weeks to engage in in a process of of trying to change and adaptobody or expose yourself to something is more than sufficient to see if its can o be and the right approach for you and i think that that the the hu the individual interpretation is always has to be considered and i think that is where it comes bat to to be a thinking man's athly or be a thinking man's trainer lik some unders going to exercise dot you have to cognis consciously understand wher your bodyes at any moment in time you got to be real with yoself you can co cra a gournal crologue of be training craologue of y feelings is subjective feed back of and how you fell you mood is leraly to that yet we wee we try to promote that because again that is thats part of this this process and may be twelve weeks for you but i might get the same responses an eight eight weeks and i think that is that is sir that is i another critical theme here is the we could put fifteen guise on the mat and give them the same work out and there is going to be fifteen different responses to that same work out because the human organism is complex and in nature tha it is cano adapt differently some people will tolerate it some people can to be challenged by it some people have got a metobolic make up that is can a promotes it some people a meto metobolically challenged by it you kno that there is there is just many different things that we have to consider and that is what we try to do here it is the cross we beare is that we try to understand on an individual level how to opto mise athletic performance i thing it is terrific and either yo ther athlytorr fortunate to have this and most people out there am ive you n ie certainly been training courage people to learn some science and some mechanism and become scientist of their own pursuits whether not skill learning or athletic pursuit a et cetera am as a sort of our final question what are ae some things about the you ave see oor something about the youi see that perhaps people do not know in terms of it is overall mission or what you ges or trying to do here i mean i think i i've become of farn of e me may and i am more and more as time and moves on am some people might be in the me mas some people not into watching him i ma but what are some things that youa see is interest ed it in and doing i det most people might not know about itd certainly i might knot know about ye i mean atha think ewe am we try to be cutting edge we try to be superprogressive we wewe think we have got an amazing platform here particularly performance institute to do some really cool things that can inform many different people and a dout that does not just mean the the six hundred u o athletes are on our global roste and what we are trying to do is is influence global community ar ound optimizing human performance o any moment in time we are engaging in different tachnologies with different venders different partners you now explore ang opportunities to learn more shad dayto understand what is the best mechanisms for you knw interpretin your body interpreting how you body's responding to training interpreting yu know u nutritia ow whatever it may be we get wereinary really privileged position to do that and but we have also i ow hence you been here to day now wewe are also trying to ventureinto some really cool areas of science and research that is got applicability and that you can take from hy performance athletes an a ply you kno to yourself to yan jo blow walking down the street out there and that that is really interesting and that is everything from and you now whether it s bd and psychadelices through to different tachnologies for you thermal monaterin and blue toot har rate monatering or whatever it may be through to dat to managemen et cetera and n anything between we have we have got some great partners on the nutrition side on the psychology side on the datoside and and i think ewe always tr to just push the envelope a little bit more i think we we keep our cormision with our athletes but a think a lot of what we do hence your podcastand nd i an amazing platformyo do such a great job of it the we can all learn and take from you kno the leat and interpret how it might help us and interest in the general population i think that is that is o o norstar is to provide our athletes the best integrated service of care and but we also one of influence you just the global community and put neither you have see at the forefront of the its great we goes ascertaintly doing it and we am cannot i let the cat ou the bag just yet but a the things that were gering up to do with my laboratory an y e were me to gather am i hopely will be able to talk about that insure that and in the yeure to come but that is were very excite about that an nam do not can look i have this i this a filter that i use when i talk to people academics or otherwise which as your some people they open their mouth and it and it does not make much difference but when you speak i learn much i i gan take the protocalls that i've ive heard about to day i'm going to think about how i'm training and hig ca traing differently and better ourm eating i could you different differently and better forsake of performent and just in in general im thank you much for your time you scientific expertese the stuff you are doing in the practical realm its its immense iflee i we can do it again yes thank you thiss been of last iappreciatea ye keep deni den casano the lot of people of the platform thanks for the invite a's been also thank you thnks much thank you for joining me for my

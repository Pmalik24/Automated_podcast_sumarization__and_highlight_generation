the phone some one shouting anybody home a al the ambulance got there just three and a half minutes after jesse disconnected from anine own one wa jesse hears him say you will wait then who that e thrise and then she hangs up it is easy to read the statistics and still not be able to imagine what the overdose crasis looks in this country more than a hundred thousand people die from an overdse each year that means an americans are now more likely to die from an overdose than from a car accident this hotline's purpose is simple and very single minded it is not to get people sober or push them into treatmen it is just to keep people aline one injection or snort after another i wanted to know what it was for every one the callers and the people jesse who sait there will some one uses knowing they could die right there on the phone jese talks to people week after week s sometimes they just stop calline maybe it is because they are not using any more maybe it is because they are gone actual overdoses on the hot line do not hap an at often njesse had no way to know what went on after she hung up that day with kimber she kept answer ind calls on the line tried to distract herself she says she probably walked around her yard put herself a sprite then she got a text from a retty close front of hers gi named stephen he is a paramatic he sees lot of overdoses she has him in her phone as bro he is a wood up homy a say at ome asall just live in a drain tikes some calls it to men you i calls which you do in hesalways did you dm at work to diran and all i forgot it ie saturday stephen works in massachusetts takes him back for thls i o ya d and ever us long cali i would is call in masschusets to day immediately her phone rings it is him instead of texting he wants to talk she answers he said where assi as a hold od on o remember he is a bit where is a bits is it old od i got to go get the book diam iopen the book northadams massachusetts the sob that left this mans shes i'll never forget hes that was me act too stephen stephen murray the parametic who responded to that overdose calld jesse took he had a lot of jobs before working in an ambulance each with a very different uniform the first was a black teashirt he was in a metal band then a sudan tie when he is in college she ran for a seat on the village council in one being a parametic been wearing a button up with a smurray on one pocket an a badge above the other he carried his dispatch radio pretty much everywhere which is how a got the call that day am thet came in s a on responsive possible overdos that is alwa bly ot when i heard the address i was ol thatually close by it was right up the hill from the ambulanc station basically on the same street werlily point four pornt five miles away i jump in how many people it was one engine company three police cruisers and sho amanses we get there d and looking at the building in it is there is multible younit is within the thespig house he bangs on the door does not hear anything then he sees a little stairaway rons up finds another door which is unlocked he lets himself in am hallo anybody here yo mess with the cops ar by me there yelling oun ookin around and am i get down this hallway at the end there is the little bathroom and i find a girl lying on the ground a woman laon therm she very small and she lookd rually young and she was blue and hows i crap why hold it why whall bes kno ite's there and she is blue when some one's blue i know ther not breathing hou thught you were too late yes her my mind when immediately was at here somebody his alone she is blue on the ground and i find her pulse an it is quite slow it is likein the fortiese i turn to the copposite she is got a pulse the bathrom is quite small though and i'm big and it is really hard to work on somebody when you cannot kneel down next to them and i put my arms under hers and i drag her iento h living room down hallway to livhere and at that point am the rest of my crew i brought all of our quipment upstairs they were they came up put down her back next to me if they would gotten there a few minutes later it might have been too late but now they had a chance stehen's got a particular way he likes to handle over doses that he feels is easier on the people being revived because he is thugh about this alot if they do come to it is conn't be a very strange experience some random guy leaning over you face upside down and if he just gives some one a big dose of narcan it will throw them into withdrawal people sometimes wake up angry bhe'l have a massive headache because they might not have been getting oxygen to their brain that lack of oxygen that is what hi'll kill you in an over dose stephen starts by fixing thot i grap the bag out mask out popked up oxygen and start to breathe for her and in the meantime i directed on of mi staffembers to draw me up at to plotn or can and put a a kneedl on iaus i to give it inter muscularly cause i can control the dose better he has the police stand in another room while he works well because the thing is i've seen people come out and vamet and feel in well and awhen i first started ne amass i rememberr the police to be standing over them what did you use yelling at them is turne to think about what is that vironmen whet they wake up if it is a their r twony people in the room i will tell people whe we outside stephen's kneeling over kimber's head squeezing oxygen intor her lungs one breath at at time then he gives her the smallest dose of nilocxon just to see how shore we act her color imperves her oxen saturation comes up and she then wakes up do youremember what she said to you she looked upset upset despite all his effort but alive there is a conversation stephen sometimes has with people he is revived he does not remember whre it happened with kimber but often it is in the back of the ambulance where the driver cannot hear r the patien will say something he is much nicer than other amptees and in stephen will explain i've been in your sheses stephen the person who revived kimber from her over dose he would also survived an over dose let me tell you it happen stphen started using drugs some time after he stopped touring with hout metal bands hehad been straight edge then no nock all no drugs but then he went to college you na received my ammy an i cademics had never been as thing the people that i fellin with my group befriends im we all met at this the tables at wereoutside the doorms and we but spoke cigarettes outside is this thing and am the gui thet used to sell us are weed he was great he wasd tos this really cools at i cave describe him he was am he would show up with a fishing tackle box full of drugs it was of manray and he knew that i was i had been strugglaing a bac a friend of the group named kelly had died recently sheu'd fallen off abalcony really on a rocked stephen's world and he was a if i remember right he was a gi try thesely to feel better and that was oxicotom sir drugs became part of stephen's very busy he is going to school working campus job head also on that seat on the local village councel at the time they were saying i was the youngest elected official and ever happened in south florida a not that is verefi bike that is what that is what people were saying about me and and here i am using drugs alltime he used in his car before talking to teevy news before bed he would lay out lines of oxy for when he woke up at night and withdrawl he was on my way he get back to sleep and he was getting way to skinny i used to wear bager close ni talke my parents thats jus that youra ons kipe i was a thing and i used to put under i concealr on my eyes to just the i have lictor of naturally dark circles under my eyes but because i had lost much weight in was sunken in they were very pronounce and i put under i concealer on before i going camer with my parents oh an actul the camera would be faced backward where i had all my actualydes on the wall sirtithicat of election from the bor elections and i got a letter from a congress then congratulating me on be elected and jus those things behind me but on the other side of the camera my life las chaos yet stephen thenks see probably ode twice somewhere in there but luckily he came too on his own note about stopped him his family at some point had an intervention which he said you could see a mile away he walked into the room anever was sitting there i no one was saying anything and he was oh i know what this is but he felt relieved to be found out he only had to go to rehab once but recovery was a long process stephen tried various jobs ran out of money went back to living with his folks they were retired in western massachusetts where he noticed they were looking for volunteer fire fires sined up and for some reason it is stock in my head in my mind in onestephen the anic an nounced even the firefaner hi was i'm fire frender that is pretty cool eventually he became a paramatic stephen's experience with a diction is not what made saphen camber emotional for him though it was something else back when stephen was using his drugs were coming from pain clennecs known as pell mells but by the time he became a parametic many of those had been shut down more and more people were getting drugs off the street that is when fentinel entered the scene that inolo could be fifty times stronger than heroine he was causing these cluster overdoses stephen would seethem from his ambulans he had have days wer ould go to five odees one after another he was saeing more people die too one case stuck with him everything went wrong they were the station when he got the call and the the street address i was givhen well say for example that was three thirteen three one three and we get there and there is no three one three this is not that uncommon but usually some one here is the sirens and comes out says wer over here and in this particular case that in hapen and we ju strick to go nock on doors and luck it' that wene on wed not out much doors and nobody ever came out and h o tha thing that dispatch wil trytidy is ill the tr to call the person back ah repeatedly nobody answered on the call back ah and anow eventually we have finnight resources the next calls are coming in we have to bev on a little while later a different call comes in i call about a dead body a woman stephen hears the location and realizes this was the over dos victim from that original call in fact stephen had knocked on her very door whoever called nine one one the first time that mixed up the numbers was not three on three it was one three three something that in stephen in the cops fanned out went house to house stephen had craned his nack to look in the window of the right building but he just could not see the woman who needed his help she was just out of view she was right around the corner from the from the door that i looked it atsef myself i was six feet from her and when i got there she was trolly nw we couldstelf saved her that was ac she somebody that i had reverse in over tis on in the past and stay liken a in real touch but she worke to the community si see her sometimes stephen played this over and over again in his mine looking for ways it could have gone differently he understood that whoever called nine one one he were doing what they could to keep this woman alive but theywerelso scared scared that when some one stephen showed up therewould be trouble they left and in the end hit was leaving this woman alone that killed her he meant stephen could not find her that over does call solidified something for stephen with drugsup getting more dangerous keeping people who used drug safe ment making sure they were not left by themselves it is sometime around then that he heard about the never us alone holl line and in immediately made sense got nvalved zo meetings stuff that that is how he met jessy to get the word out where he was he made these little cards bike made this simple design on a this to pran and i'm not a what design or o raut design or lookes terrible but beasely as is the masterst fine heres the numbers wwe do ah and i ouse my onlye crani car in about five thous of this he convinced programs the give out clean syringes to include these never use alone cards in their kits stephe had no idea if any of this was really working a lot of times he 'd talk to drugeas ers who said what i cn call of some stranger tell him i'm about to inject dope we kitting but a few hours before he revived kimber she had gotten one of these cards bundled up wit the stuff sheh'd picked up it a needle exchange that was why she called that was the thing that saved her life stephen did not know that though when he dragged her out o the bath from that day and started giphen her rescue rests there was a self one wiht next to her he just did not put two and two together after kimber opened her eyes stephen told her she had to go to the hospital for observation that ment she had to do this walk of shame down her front steps and climb into the back of the ambulance is nearly summer but she put on her big winter coat pulled up the hood stephen started packing up before yeu left the scene he went to checkin with his crew im they had the back doors of the ablonce open i stepped up into the back to to talk to them ad i it it doned at me again ou she was alone i said something on the lines of whoever was shere with you called and left you need to tell a never da that again they need to stay with the until we get here and then she said i was not with anybody else alone i said ill that who called im an one then she said i called it of uselon holine o my god he thought when he got back to the station that is when he started texting jesse and that is when an all kind of came out of him when she told me that she is the operator a strated crying i could not believe it lit be sopbed on the found together ous and as in my office these jus a conference room thing thos and i had the door closed n as tackinerson ther lie cryimg in her an e nows jus s well stephen says over his time as the parametic he pronounced made be thirty people dead from an overdose all of them were alone ckimber was alone too but she had the line the linead work it is rare to find something that actually protects people once their dealing with an edection but ephen when you saved some one from an overtose it does not me they will stop using fact usually they do not the morning after stephen revived kimber jesse sen her attacs hi she wrote i am thankful you called she sent this thelittle smily face and a green hardimoje we then a couple of hours kimberro back she thankd jesse asked how many times she got n arcand then kiber says i want to use again this morning but im terrified if you use again to day jesse replied the likely to o view o deing again is almost guranteed mary harris coming out what is jesse steal al a fight in a christ became parkingot that is in a minute cogobu agradio when a prigram continues tosmarein life my rglass to day show the call story of one phone call to one telephone hot line anset after mouth kimma did keep using and kept calling the line and last time she was connected with jesse which brings us to act three of our program jesse again heres mary harris jesse is kind of the back stop for the entire hot line the whole operation if none of the other operators ar available the calls automatically go to her and she predy much always picks up some times she will even give some one her cell and say just call me directly she did that with kimber it she cannot help herself o i got call oger i went time to visit jesse at her home in georgia to watch her work e never ye's alone is jesse from the second i walked in she s taking calls still in her house dress and missmashed socks the vibe was organized chaos she takes in strays seven cats one is missing an ie a choalla and more chickens than she can counc yo mit look at our eggs what those e ror your chickin a ye to the evenigs wee got eatini they lay their eggs in the garage i wanted to know how jesse nurse ad ended up spending much of her time on this line and at some point and a pause in the conversation she said thes my child has called this line before she was talking about calen calen's twenty three her only kin she is most magnificent crature ever met maa she is also the vragediest bitch of eer memaa she is magnificent she is magnificent calen is over dosed a dozen times in counting have you picked up the phone ments yeur daughter no she will let me now she would let me know that she was callin i hay mamma i'm gin a call the line thanks for letting me now i do not it tha na i thing i know that i could cut it all i could cut the mamma olf i could keep the mamma cut off if she become unresponsive i kno i could do what i have to do but what if i could watching her daughter nearly die again and again 's kind of how jesse came around to a whole new way of thinking and the hot line to she tried for years to force her daughter to change she wanted her to finish school she wanted her to go to rehab she wanted her to come home but wanting all that never made anything go differently it just made calen push her awy now for her daughter she really only has one goal it is the same goal she has for her callers do not die jesse's serious about this goal and this one goal only she literally has a ta too in her forearm it is a bird taking fligh it is carring a banner in its bea with a single word on it foc as in i do not give a foc my fucxs are flying away jesse told me this one story about a time calen pulled up in fron of the house with ae bagadope and a couple of friends as late at night just jessein her hus band at home calen called her from the drive way iso what er ye all dolen she is wil mama we just picked up from a new gon when i was sure its sifer no assid as it yaggll sit in ma front yard and use do in a car as ta how the hal wat us to have a what am what ami do for yall in a car calen and i heard her she is i told you all we could go inside i said yes ye sid you geither going to come in side or yu goin to get out my yard does not i cant she o friends in believer ithey came in and she watch as her aughter injected herself at her kitchen table i had many questions about this approach i'm apparent i know how hardd it is to stop wanting things for your kids stop protecting them stop pushing them toward some imagined better future the implications of abandoning that wanting we are radical to me i asked what if calen never stop susing drugs if if if if what she wants to dos continue to use she is be alave and healthy to do if what she wants to do is i's one day kick and going in to something els she should be healthy and alave to i it i do you even see her no longer using permanently as a goall i do not mi i honestly do not think about what calen willr will not do and i honestly do not ion't mean this to sound it is going sayown arly do not care what ciland does as long as she do not di that wll be gright that is

matter remember jusse was on her way to work when all this happened i was in my nursin unifor m going to teach i ma i teach collegiately i was going to lecture iwas going to stand at my podium looking

just happened iter that fight in the parking ln jussie trd to getting needles for calin then she ordered narcan she got a big box to distribute around town an inside was 'never use alone car jusse saw it an thoughte ho good idea tgooi heard about never use alin wone i ordered my own narcan from the new york city depamen of hole you have to go to a training before they'l sendit to you the training tells you how an when re verson overnows and one o ther power point sides mention the ho mine at the time i imagine never usalone with some official thing nine one one but it is nothing that it was trned is jussy put it by bunch of drung users we are tired of watching the friends duy when she first volunteered to answer calls the screening process to be an operator consisted of talking to one guy to see if ye were a fit the very same da ay she picked up her cell and got connected to some one who is about to get high as at helli he said i'm trin tor eats never es alone i'm halls yet i guess yo did but dos i kno what iveu not knew it needed to get his a dryus u i else cat the nobriter ri but olt tha tht if li he thoght where you gan o get my from atan i'n one in from mason on need he is i o god he sid hes a your gon to let me din i'm won me it seems that wyr right anels a help me out in the years since jessese set up a whole system a scripp that operators can uws a training regimen but this organization is still basically run on a gugldock in a prayer i hung out while jese took one call after another over two days never ye's alone is jesse the calls were intimate sometimes joyful one gy talk to jesse forlyke half an hour about his life where he was going over the week and his girl friend his health yeu did good you drink in a i also water for ever kill a grand bodywat t are't she dake me figure that at the less i'm a thought hy another guy im me felt guilty for taking up jesse's time he tried to have everything ready to go when he called and he apologized afterward listen he fit one for people you callin people me would not have nothin to do i'd be bored is hayo i am glad you called me he told her he tapes nark hand to his arm and sits on his porch after getting high in case he passes out he hopes his neighbors ill find him there wis no recovery talk sprinkled throughout these conversations were little reminders of how scary things are forthe people who need this line jesse gently admonished one cller who told her he would used on his own a few hours before without letting her know you care not call me ye know my heart would be broke if som happene to e i know that he says i know ijust just callis is ot a bother even if it is a tiny amount o ki even ats the tiney amount of oka you are worth at you are worth it every time ki it is notable that every one in his story as some kind of connection to addiction the people who started the hot line stephen the paramatic jesse with her daughter and actually jesse herself twenty years ago she would real poblemint of yeins i did beck in two thousand too i'd had a surgery and my daugter put me on oxy thirties i'm a nurse he time i called for refill ok out for jesse there as no rock bott om moment but after a couple o years she started running out a pills and she did not want a risker nursing license to get more she quick cold turkey spent three days sick on her bath room floor then it was over jese says her daughter calen started using years later when a boy friend introduced her to heroine jesse wonders about why a lot everone has a why jesse says calan's why she thinks sortof hasd to do with her the're pa ticcular er mother daughter relationship jesse can be a hard ask calan too when calin got pregnant at fifteen jesse thought kalan's boy friend was bad news she blocked him his family from

nr homeeand there home he is done and now it is about the entire talmot when jesse tok that call from kimber listen to her o d on the line she knew better than to expect that moment to change kimber's life and the next day when kimber thank jesse for saving her and then quickly followed that up with i want o use again it did not surprised jesse in fact for jesse this was good news it meant she could encourage kimber to keep using the line and it was an invitation sandtact she did she friended kimber on facebook taxed her for no reason a few months after her od kimber started calling jessie mamma but kimber would also drift away when she did that stephen and jesse would try to keep track of kimber on line what she was liking and commenting on messenger shows her active six minutes ago jesse texted stephen at one point she has even red my message a texterphon nothing ye he replied she is ben leaving me on rad she would seen his message but had not replied a month later jesse tried

trying to help out i or ell after all he an kimber lived in the same town stephen got kimber back into rehab then he offered to get hr into job training a few weeks after her over dose he posted a picture of the to of them on twitter kimberad shown up at stephen's july forth barbicu a few months after that though is when kimber went silent per stevhen en jesse weeks went by then months and then jesse got a taxt from a number she did not recognize it read ha jessie it is kimber i just wanted to give you my new number jesse replies oh hey hi for exclamation marks kmber was alive u your gid this of course finally is kimber kimber lives in vermot now she is been sober for one year reallythe place she calls home as a tidy duplex where she lives with her little gray dog luna and not a lot else she did not bring anything with her when she left massachusetts where she o deed to years back there are not any family pictures on the wall not many mamentos kimber's grn plants though hogs nature's always been her thing as a kid she was the one who was always bringing creatures home dou remember almira from ludytons ye my family called me al mira because iat her thing on the show was you would she would kiss in hug and squeeze animals till they died and at's a the gog beecause i always had some kind of critter or am stuff that in her new apartments there is little sunroom off the kitchen i kimber wanted to make it into a green house but the radiator started lakein there itand the floor got soft i spantly still this is a fresh starn do you you keep norkin rounstill i do i do i carry it with me om you just never know when you are ettang ead n our kain ye i just sent a revive somebody the other day here at an aimeeting it was different being on that side of things you do not even think about the fact that you lmost died that is the craze part i forgot about a couple my over doses because could you kind it just fall asleep and do not even know that you fall asleep i'd always gett mad you getten out of the personuare what are you tressing out about i'm here i'm fine what is the proplem and then i watch people overdose in it is it happened it is three minutes between when you are kin them and they will come back it feels an eternity and all those things fromn your head this persons dead i doft kno ffon this persons coming back thn you realize o you oh i gave this was pretty scarry on that first day she called the line the day jesse answered and stephen revived her kimber remembers waking up to a cold shiver rolling down her spine shewas looking don the hallway to the bathrom where she last remembered being the bathroom now filled with cobs there was the swut case she just luged home from re hab and then she got really really sick after stephen forced her to go to the hospital she checked herself out within an hour and walked home puking along side of the road she picked up more drugs pretty much right away the whole idea of never use alone's approach is that as jessie puts it you give the callers time one more day to fight their demons and kimber had a lot of demons she says her parents both use drugs ut she was seven teen her brother was killed by a drug dealer the whole family can crumbled after that kimber included kimber wen ter re hav on and off for years she oas a tunnadrugs realized things were getting a little out of control and checkin for a couple of weeks to spindry as she put it she get clean enough to go back to work and pay her rent and hen the cycle would start back up again the call with jesse was not the moment things change that moment came over your later things had gotin bad she says the sheriff it kicked her out of her apartment the one were stephen had revive ter her card been stolen and totalled she was carring around a back pack with her passport and birth certificate in it but then it disappeared herself one was gone to she woulda friend whowould let er crash but the friend had a condition kimbr had to call detoks every day and tried to get a bed which eventually she did the hot line is called never use alone but walking into rehab kimber was utterly in completely alone maybe for this part you have to be when she arrived the nurse asked if she wanted medication methodon to make getting straight a little easier t coltr for the first time she said no i went up to detox in detoxed with no medication what in that feelike it was awful i could not i just mev wer going in ind i did not i could not lay in the bed it was cold they had the easy blasting it was summer time course it you see's on but you you were going through which also you are cold and i could not lay in the bedcase they give you these thin blankets i wit in the bath room where there is a heat or thing in there and laid on the floor and they drak me out they would not let me stay in the bath room tha you cannot lay in here and then i waited for them to leave and i went into t that room the only thing that fell good was i stripped down naked it was a really small batheron was tile floors i had to throw my clothes out of the door back into my room and just lay on the tile and i had the blanket over i the heating then and i just had the hea on there but tlike the coolness on my back and in the he on mi got it was the only thing that kep me being able to sit through it and i mean i was throwing out the whole time and i do not know how long i was there it was a while it just felt days and days went on and i did not think it was evergan stop and i just kept telling myself that i could do it ai really had strength to do it kmber remembers all the details because she is really proud of what she did four days after she checked in she sent jesse that text from a new fhon i feel come in a stable enough place raight now to reach out and let a back kimber wrote tenatively jesse said everything that you have been through has prepared you for to day you have not been wasting time you have been getting ready i'll support you however you ned me to every step in the way for kimber it is been a year of big changes she is in a new town but she still does not really trust herself round her old crowd it is interesting how this one call brought these three people together stephen told me when ye first met jesse hey did not really each other too similar maybe but the call bondat them somehow and kimber right after that call she avoided stephen even though we kept reaching out she was embarrassed he lived in her town knew all the police she said she got to this point where she knew other people were sick of her blshet because she was sick of her bulshe that passed eventually kimber tok a trip with stephen's family to the beach this summer there these fotos of them hanging out in the sand jesse to this day has not met kimber in person but they texed all the time on mother's a kimber sent jesse a card there was a picture inside of it an altra sound kimber's pregnant i always said my body was too poisonous for anything to live inside i i had done much to myself and jus berated my body and you knowt there was no way anything was about to live in this tokic environment kimbers got a partner mikey she met him in a a they moved intogether this pregnance was a surprise but a happy one and i think there was deffenin mou partof me that did not thought i did not know how to be a mother when i thought i was pregnant even if i had to do it by myself i was going to do it ik om thirty one years old i was sober ible to a bra new pleace started with nothing and i knew i could do this if i could do everything i was doing i could do this too i never for a second thought that i was gete not keep the baby kimber still dreams about using drugs he ise here absurd dreams vivid dreams dreams about smoking dope that turns into venila frostang and most of the people she went to rehab with they have gone back to ousing these days jesse's still taking calls sometimes ten calls a day she does not heare from her daughter calin very much but i did reach calan she told me she is trying to use less mostly she said she is sticking with weed as for stephen he says reviving kimber changed his life he would been having nightmares about all the people he failed to save after kimber survive te realized he did not have to be the one pumping oxygen and some one's longs to keep them alive he could work more on the hot line instead he is doing that he semens tared taking cals stephen and jesse wanted kimber to come work on the hotline too she went through the training and just took her very first

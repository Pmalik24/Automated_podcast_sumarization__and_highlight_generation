simply in need of love and protection from his daddy hunter was indited on nine tax charges in california including three felonies according to the associated press the charges are quote centere on at least one point four million dollars in taxes hunter by nowe between twenty sixteen and twenty nineteen a period where he has acknowledge struggling with eddiction again that is the associated press noting that hunter should basically be let off to hook for not paying millions in dollars of taxes because he liked the drugs but as the indictment points out hunters taxfailures post date his eddiction issues as though any one else could claim that their eddiction was responsible for their failure to pay their taxes prosecutors no quote notably in twenty twenty well after hunter had regained his subriety and when he finally filed his out standing twenty sixteen twenty seventeen an twenty eighteen forms ten forty the indictmen says that if ind men did not direct any payments toward his tax liabilities for each of those years prosecutors say that hunter subverted quote the payroll and tax with holding process of his own company by with drawing millions outside of the payrell and tax with holding process the maximun sentence for bidon's alleged crimes seventeen years in prison the fence attorney abylowl blamed special prosecutor david wites he said that he was cavings for publican presser to proscue lowells had quote based on the fax and law if hunter's last name was anything other than bidon the charges in delaware and now california would not have ben brought well frankly if hunters last name was anything other than bidon he would be a poor dearelect and he would be in jail long ago he neverwold made this money all the money is because his last name is bidon and then his immunity is because his last name is bidon if his name were hunter smith he would already have been in jail for drug charges tax charges sex trafficin charges violation of the forein agent's registration act in fact special councel david wise only brought this prosecution after one o the most botch plead deals of all time in which the department of justis run by hunters daddy tried to dismiss hunters tax charges by attaching them quietly to his gun charge plee a plea that left him with no jail time the whole purpose was to stimy any investigation into hunters financial relationship with joe when the judge in that case notice the sneaky tactic the judge blew up the deal because when it was publicized even the epartment of justice was forced to walk away from its on deal none of that wouldhave ben made public except for two ieres whistle blowers garri shaply and joseph ziggler will ledge that the deo jay had intervene to stop david wis from using the kind of power necessary to prosecute hunter in the first place in other words the tax charges are coming now only because the hunter bidin cover up imploded now cort g to prosecutors hunter spent money on drugs strippers wuxury hotells exotic cars quot in short everything but his taxes hunt are apparently spent is what he spent not wuld ye earn he spend a million dollars and twenty sixteen one point four million dollars an twenty seventeen one point eight million dollars an twenty eighteen and six hundred grad and twenty nineteen he made seven million dollars and gross income betwen twenty sixteen and twenty twenty in those years hunter spend over six hundred eighty three thousin dollars on various women as well as a hundred an eighty eight thousand dollars on a dult entertainment first ofall has not the guiver looked up the innernet were porn is free anyway is this the end of the hunter bidan story now tha he is being prostecuted there is every chance that the go ja will claim that the in vestigation has had its end point to spite special council wisis claims the probut remains open after all what better wait to buried jofs involvemen in his sons corrupt schemes then to send that is on to jail and claim the justice has been done all after the bidanteem tried and failed to cram through a corrupt sweetheart deal with hunter no matter what though hunters can be a mag our headache for jobidon all the way through the twenty e twenty four election cycl joe we will have to answer for first that at tempted sweetheart deo that wist tried to cut with hunters to fence teem whistle lowers as we have talked about have already a ledge that the bidon do jay tried to hamstring wisis investigation those questions will be piled on top of questions about jofs involvemant in hunters business given that we have years of evidence that jo was involved and just as many years of jo lying about both hunters innocens and his own ignorance jobidon's twenty twenty reelect effort

house investigators keep digging into the bite an family business this week it comes new evidence of the ways that jobidon helps his son using elios emil accounts ieres agents schapley and zigler we talked about provided to the house wags and means committee more information from their multiyor investigation into hunter bidon's taxes and businesses the documents include and eleven paghe log showing a list of three hundred twenty seven emales jo sent or receed from twenty tens to twenty nineteen hunder sudnims including robin ware four fivesix and robert el peters tmister biden was a big user of those shadow accounts apparently the national arkhisan records administration says that it has up to eighty to fousen pages of emales and documents sent o received under those aliases wal jo was vice presinent the three hudrd twenty seventymales listed in the log are exchanges between joe and hunter or erik scweran a former hunter business partner who handled the bidon family finances the committe has fifty four of those exchanges are between jobidon and erik schwarin five emales were exchanged within five days bidons twenty fourteen trip t ukrane another twenty seven were exchanged prior to his return trip to ukrane in november twenty fourteen those trips coincided with hunters lukrative board position at ukranian energy frorm berizma the trips proceeded jobidons twenty fifteen rol in forcing the ouster of the ukranian proscutor investigating berizma and it seeyonac li is love chetsk for corruption another thirty eight emales originated from within the white house and were sent to jo bidon aliases with hunter bidon copied the comitte does not know the contents of those emales but further evidences provided to congress raises serious questions about hunters roll at berizma and the political access that he was peddling an again all of hunters former business partner say that was exactly whi hunter was involved in these businesses in the first place hunders former business partners have an archer previously told congress that quote berisma would ave gone out of business if it idn't have the bidon brand attached it to it also wason means has new emales from ziggler that a revealing about what berisma wanted from hunter one is from vadimporsharsky and adviser to berizma two hunter in april twenty fifteen again jo was vepe at this time the ukrenian thanked hunter for quote the opportunity to meet your father and spend some time together in octobert twenty sixteenymale weteen a bluestar imploy blu star is one of the companies that was wrun with hunter bidon in one of those emales october twenty sixteen between a bluestar employe and erik schwerren includes the news the ukranian government had ended its prove in tis lovechetzky schweran congratulates the teemounted to awsum work the bluestar employ writes thanks ou brought us in take a victory lap all which suggests the joe knew full well that hunter was selling the family brand again all of the stuffis can be swirling around jo and it is not that donald trump is going to be abl to confront jobidnon stage about this there will beno debates ms telling you right now jobiden is not geting on stage with donald trump one f the reasons dis not geng on stage donal trump obviously isses health his sinility all the restvent the other is that donald trump achaly would pummelhim on the hunter stuff in this time it woul have some teeth last time joges lied about it last timejo said myson never did anything wrong he never had a relations with china noverner dollar from chinas trump worn dollars from trum all of that has been blown up trump would hit him with the kitchen sink if trump is indeed the nomine as expected there not con be on stage together but that does not mean these stories are ging to go away surrounding jo and the chao surrounding joe is the biggest threats to his potential twenty twenty four run his intire case rght now is that the chao surrounding trump is bad that youre better off with the chaos rather than the other chaos tos a battle of chaoses and all of the cha surrounding trump again is his best case that is why all of these trials are going to be damaging to trump thinks jo bidon and he democrats think that now the problem for them is tht agat we have been doing this for a while now if the rilian a hit trump with all these trials they shuld aveannounced all these trials next year they hid it a little but early and that means that even while the trials are going on most american to me reseem this before now trump for his part he has file motise on thurs day saying he is going to appeal a d c sjudgeis ruling that he is not a mune from being charged with federal crimes for his efforts to undo the outcome of the twenty twenty election the notice is minor procedral step according to the washington post but it sut's in motion one of the most potentially consequential parts of trumps legal saga as the first former president to be charge with crimes because again this has morned with the time line than th actural outcome of the case if the case is delayed beyond twenty twenty four and if trump becomes presidenthe case goes away his trump presum lu just pardon himself or the deoce is now run by trump and you would expect thad the case basically gets tumped at the altar with that sad if the case goes forward trums gn spend an awful ot of time an court and has trumpets pointed out these cases are a stratch the only one of these cases filed against onnal trump that has any legal merit at all is the classified documents case in florida and again he is made the political case that that is in fact a political prosecution given the fact that apparently everybody who is involved the federal government has ended up with classified material in the basement now the count sur argument to that from the prosecutors gan be welt yet and then they all turned it in when we found out about ers suppose to u youare shifting boxes ant all thet but in the world of politics it all just looks one wall of sound one wall sound directed against trump if the idea trum the bidon administration is that trump is a threat because he is chaotic and also he is a fashios well mhen what you would need to do presumably is not look a cot a chaotic fashus but that is exactly to bid administration seems to be doing on the regular and that is a problem and in fact the rosecution of trump is helping trump make that case about to bidon here is trump yesterday talking about how once again this e witch hun up in washington d c and in new york an allthe rest again that case that he is making right there it had a lot less thal to it had a lotless feel to it when it did not feel as though jobiden was actively attempting ho stop donald trump from attaining the presiden se the more cases get piled on top of cases the more it feelds exactly that s on the one hand you have the entire democratic party swiveling toward the trump is a phoshus message woll the deo jay is going after donald trump an after the deo jay tried to cut a sweetharty old hunterbidon and then that in floated that is on the one hand in the other hand you have the jobidon teem trying t o say thet trump is a chaos agent but the problem is the democratic party is a party of haos right now nobody feels secure jobidon is the president if youre feeling chaoticrae nownce onkas odonal trump if your feeling a sense of chaos about the international scene that is not becaus a donal trump if youre feeling chaotic on the domestic sene democrats run the senate and democrats run the white house very difficult to blame donald trump an the republicans for that even if they are in fact a chaotic mes of a party which they are an the republican party is a chaotic mesfa party no dout about it the problem is for the democrats are they and the're he ones in chargs right now and typically when people do a bad job they get kicked out on their rears illgets

trump number one that bian's trying to make s that he is a fashus then bidon's use of the deojetogo fter trump looks pretty bad for biden if case number too is the trump is a chaos agent and we certainly cannot hav a caos agent as the president well then you got a look a little but less chaotic and right now it looks jo bidon is ready to either fall down or set something on fire or both every moment of the damn to day and sos is party he the democrats and congress who keep pointing at the republicans in saying their oblep sho which again is true i mean they are just as much o a bleip sho and the're the one tor in charge the the the ratical wing of the democratic party has yet to be disown by the democratic party at sed for long time which ever party runs to sanity first winds and los nither party is interested in running toward sanity at any rate of speed yesterday was a bannar day for the squad in congress between defending jemal boman and defending ntisematism they really to themselves proud alexandero coso cortez it completed yot shea she spent yesterday defending tromalbomen for pulling a fire alarm she i got a say i will never cease to be amazed at the fact that some people consider this human being to be intelligent that is an amazing amazing thought uamerica's a wonderful contry literally anty one can succeed literally anyone in any case here is alexander o coto cortes defending a fello mumber of congress for pulling a fire alarm to e lay a vote jema bomin has more courage in tan ysky finger than the entire republican party put to gat ther more entigrity than

decided to believe theire cohans are gettng worse i thats what is to day is about they are wasting our time the're wasting the country's tire o the're wis your darty what rises to censure i mean truly the is arguments that are being made here what is next she walking je walking i mean he pulled the fire alarm to delay a vote he pulled the firearm alarm to elay a vote the disease of of crazy hands by the wayis gtting worse and i thinks true for pretty much all of our politicians i will in fact landonel trum for this h donel trum he has the specific hanmotions iin the litle boxmasley let abit out here about mostly in the bo didt ready in here in the lilebox and then comela hrris all over the place mum u and then you have got aose who is moving and grovin t t the hands are getting crazier

corporations the anboc yorstiden leaders to deny climate fiencs to delay climate just a lotaa and i it is greenwas climate in action she is in the boxgy she is in the everybody stop e the hands it is too much a ka but again back to the democratic hast the squad which has yet to be disoned by the mainstrom democratic party because there the future the future is more ons with double diget i cues what extremely ratical in their socialism that is to the democatic parti can ot his own iona pressley spent yesterday when aoshe was not stumping for truballboban a fellow idiot iona pressly the addrent member of the squatshe is the ringo star of the squad she is one everybody for gots about im but to iana pressly she suggested yesterday that it is important to expand access to the balabox tho sixteen year olds as a bosson city counts er prior to my time here congress i was proud to advocate for expandid access to the ballad box requiring balance we made available a multible elanguages expanding early voting in local elections and in congress i led effreds i let efforts and legislation to lower the federal voting age to sixteen and urge the deogae to agressively protect voting rights and tho fight against votor suppression she unsixteen year olds to vote sixteen yearls or some the dumb is people on planted earth sust come i mean other than members of the squad but sixteen sixteen year olds haabout we raised the voting age to people whoar non dependent on their parents out that i you have t ave independent income tovote habout if your dependent on somebody else than your vote ought not acount that seem a better rule if we goin change the voting rules h about that habout of all of your income is ern from somebody else you do not get a say that mas a hell of a lot more sense than making sixteen sixteen year olds heres all an allowance from their parens 's ridiculous these are the democrat pagan your'r make the argument tat these voks ought to be the the non cat this is this is the sober party this is the sober party by the way thes party is sober will not even denounce it is only anti somie andi mean it is full scale were shet ed to leav ell han o mor anti

these forms of hate that it is not being weaponize in a way to silence voices myself and are many of the voices that are here she is a victim and the democratic party still refuses to say this meanwhile corry bush another atr member of the squad but just as terrible she is the beelam member of the commeo squad i she says this this is hysterical honestly this is really realy ponny when you hve democrats are now claming that words cannot hurt anybody the entire party is predicated on the notion that words hurt people that is literally what that is their whole stick ton trumpeas of fash esecause he says mean words to them and nother meanwords do not hurt anybody a specialy when we are calling for the death of all jews that is thus just mean words here is corry bushtoing this rutine yestera be roteber ofor the s anta for b wer youful o ror o raso first of all let me jus say i have condemned antitematism eight hundred time over and over and not to tinth october the seven but this

relations and youas openly celebrating the october seventh comoss terror attacks on his ralies the worst terrattack in the west since nine eleven here a was cairs executive direct r the people of gaza only the side the te brag the siege the walls of the constantration cam an october sevens and yes i was happy to see people breaking the siege and throwing down the saculs of ther on land and walk fie into their lands that the wer no alaw to walk in and yes the people of gas tha have the rie to se defence have the to defend themselves and yes is ther a te ocupying poa the no have thethrie the set defence a watswords were perfectly in line but the council on american aslomic relations generalized antitematism and raticalism on october seven the date of the commass massacre care which they werethe group car national twee to quote we join the american muslem community in reafforming our support for the palistinian people's right to freedom and calling for an in to the israili occupation which sparks the deadly violenes we see again and again including to day on october seventh before any is rally response care also called for an end to american aid to israel as well as an end to the abrahamic words the group has not offered a single word condemning commass but here is the thing care remains a go to organization for both the left wn media and democrats in politics in may in an attempt to counter accusations of antisemitism from inside the democratic party the white house organized a national strategy to counter and tisemitism that strategy included a group dedicated to cross community solidarity and that group this anti antisemitism group to fight antisemitism included care which the white house said would quote launcha tours to educate religious communities about steps they can take to protect their houses of worship from hate incidents such as instituting appropriate security measures developing strong relationships with other faith communities and maintaining open lines of communication with local law inforcement wi was care included in this enterprise well in order to support that intersectional coalition the bde administration is attempting to build now the jews do not rually fit in that intersectional coalition of course they do not fit comfortably in the oppressor oppressed matrics that under scores left wing ideology because jews are both highly targeted for hate and also highly successful but the laft likes the pretense that jews belong in the coalition care is the price of jewish belonging since there is no substitute for care in the organizational coalition to represent muslims jewish groups are expected to swallow hard and pretend that care is legitimate as tablen magazines arm in rosan size quote the aihdiellan care might not get along but they are protected by the same dynamic they both providing nearly identical service to the same larger coalition which returns the favor by keeping both groups at a level of prominence that crowds out any potential rivals that is the bid administration's program activate that intersectional coalition of the oppressed at all costs and that means covering up radical muslem hatred for gews and that means including radical muslems even in the program to fight antisemitism that was the plan at leas bidn special onvoy for moniter ing and combating antisemotism teberlipstat admitted that kar was problematic in her words but said they could be included in the white house working group on antisemitism because quote if they 're really willing to change if they are really willing to say hey we now see this as a serious problem than they are welcome but of course kar was not willing to change that was obvious from the word go to actively opposkamas would violate karas entire reason for being the roots of the council on american aslomic relations are fascinating in frightening as prosecuteor anni mcarthy writes in his book the grand ghad komas supporters gathered at a mariad hotel in philadelphia on october twenty seven nineteen ninety three with the intent of creating a new public relations organization in the united states those koma supporters included one omar achmad president of the aslamic association for palistine concerned about being recorted achmad re ferred to himself as omar yakya and referred to sama instead of kamas sama is komas backwards of course ackhmad at the meting said that t would be worth while to lie about the agenda that the new organization could not admit quote we represent sama kamas or that achmad yaseen the had of kamas represents me instead they would claim thatit was all about pushing is ra back to the forty a borders awad who is at the time the piar director for the i ap was also at that conferente awa of course is now the executive director of kar there according to mac carthy awad was an active participant in themeetings where he agreed with achmad about adopting line to americans quote when i speak with the american i speak with some one who does not know anything as for the palistinian who has a martyr brother or something i know how to address him you see less than one year later after that meeting kar was born kar was lengt the holy land foundation and the muslen brotherhood from its foundations as daniel pipes explains quot komas designated a terrorist organization by the us and many other governments indirectly created kar and two groups eremainteit examples in nineteen ninety four karhad nehatowad publicly declared his support for komas the holy land foundation of komas frunk group contributed five gran to kar in turn kar exploited the nine eleven attacks to helpra's money for the holy land foundation moltzba board members and staffic kar have been arrested or s anit entry to the united states or were indited on and played guilty to terrorism charges kar defended the nineteen ninety three world trade senter bomers calling their convictions a quote travesty of justice they did not condemoson been ladon for nine eleven tuntill benloden himself claimed the criame they apposed the deportation of terorist rasmia oda they steadfastly tie virtually all antiterror efforts to phantum is lamaphobia in two thousand eight the f bii cut off relations with kare but under democrats the american government has never been willing to let go of the ilusion tat the council on american aslonic relations represents o crucial part of the intersectional coalition intwo thousand eleven the aboma justice department teclined to prosecute kara co founder omar achmad achmad as we have said worked closely with the holy land foundation and with the aslamic association of palistine that decclanation to prosecute came despite the fact that both attorny general arcolder and then af bii director robert mular had serious reservations about kar according to reporter pactric quo quote indictments were scuttled last year at the direction of top level political uppoint es within the abama justice department and possibly even the white house the trumpetministration when it came in cut off relations with care but under the bide administration here was bath the hota wad has spent years being fetted by the media because the left wing media require a muslim organization within the intersectional coalition no matter how extream thus a wat is welcome to national t v to pretend to moderation even while he spouts cme oss talking points here he was on amesan be s just last month i mean in thistekin the throu then we we hav in tor lies for for age is etin young jewish a medicans

october seventh and all of the rest the question is when the left will be willing this time to admit what is plain that carre is a radical islamist organization now the white house house put out a

from most radical members of its own base the university system continues to struggle with the facts that they are funded in large measure not only by radical leftus who actually come oss for example but actually by governments the government of cuttar cuttar has spent literally hundreds of millions of dollars at american universities i mean it hundreds millions and this has been attempted to be obscured by various college president's butt the reality is that again cuttar which is very very from ly with eron has gain has gained power at a lot of these universities the reason that they they give money to american universities is not because they love american higher education it is because they wish to dedicate for example middle eastern studies programs tat are stacked tof professors who promote the pro oron anti israel pro radical islam point tof view columbia's middlestern studies program is just the best example of this but governments cuttar they give huns of money to these universities they are asked about begwatt university presents were asked about this at that hearing a couple of days go an they pretend thad they had no clue how much money was actually flowing in but the answer is not just hundreds of millins dollars over the cource of years billions of dollars have been flowing into american universities in order to again by access or to prop up people who they think agree with them according to wy net news three weeks ago the flow of catari funs to various sources did not concern anyone money was delivered without interruption but some of that money was being delivered to academia the catari governments and billions of dollars to ivyleage american colleges yearly forcing institutions to adapt and la violant propalisinian protest for example according to the free press cottar again has been spending thons of money in these places it is not a giant shocke at tese universities are fully in line with the needs and wants of the cataries according to a piece from eli lag over at the fhree prestrus last month since nineteen ninety haven cottar has donated more than a hundred three million dollars to virginia commonwealth university fra fine artz campus since two thousand one cottar has donated one point eight million dollars to cornal fro medical school since two thousand three cotterhas donated nearly seven hundred million dollars to texas a n m for an engineering campus since two thousand four cottar has donated seven hndred forty million dollars to carnegy mellegan university for computer science campus om as he li likes us one might expect that scholarly institutions that a benefited from this autocrasy's money would rethink their partnership after cotar's forn minister said that israel alone is responsible for the pagromup prepetrated by comas terris or after cottar's prime minister has kept the comass office open in its capital bot th universities have decline to make any statement aboutus at all in fact hally brown spokeswormen for a tex san mt had quote maintaining relationships of contries cottar serves a broader purpose including fostering international dialogue and cooperation texa a an ms relationship of coters focason educational and research activities i mean wy exactly would they be doing all of us again the reason there doing all this is to buy access that is why you do it or to promote people who are already pushing youryour own perspective on these issues andth the fact that that this was considered wildly non controversal for twenty years as cannomon amazing amazing thing until twenting twenty one the highs profile recipients of cotari money in washington d c was the brooking institution in twentny thirteen it received a four year fourteen point eight million dollegran telp fund the brookings dohacenter brookings receives another for your grants in twenty seven from cotar but in twentin twenty one the institute ended its relationship with the doha center claiming was focasing on the futur on digiral and global engagement why exactly well because the dohacenter closing overlapped with an fpiai investigation into retired marine general john allan whose presdent brookings between november twenty seventeen and june twenty twenty two because whose acting is an un register lobbius for cottar again these universities tere's a lad a money tied up in their left wing a genda the good news is that people are tarting to see this and pull their cash according to acios university pensylvania doners with drawing a gifts worth round a hundred million dollars to protest the choolds response t antisematism on campus the final straw for rostevens founder and of stonerige assat management was tuesday's testimoney from pen president lizmc gill he is pulling his one hundred million dollars there are thereare other outlets there are now turning against the university system in excellent ways for example there is a group calle palanteer palanteer is now opening up a hundred and eighty hiring slots to suden's afraid of antisemitism on campasand will s tire you directly out of college dureng you hae to finish up her college to green ap the owing out want from palentier is expand that not only to jusafraide of antisemitism but to every one everyone needs to start hiring people to rectly out of high school and stop worrying about where they want to college these colleges are in doctrination mills that are designed specificlly to rack up dat and also two indoctrinate your kids into left wing world views this is why people should stop complying with the nonsense that these universities are are somehow training and honing the mines of these folks according to mediai rabbi david wolpy who i know i'm friendly with with rabbiwopi is a visiting scholar harvard's viny school he just resigne from th university's anti semtism advisory commitee on thursday just two days after president clodyan gazes controversional congressional testimony earlier this week wolbe said as of to day i've resined from the antisemetism advisory committe at harvar without rehashing all the obvious reasons that a ben endlessly adum brated on line with great respect for the members the cmmittee the short explanation is both o venson campus and the painfully an adequate testimony reinforce the idea i cannot make the sort of difference that i had hoped that of course is exactly rights that is exactly right its time to abandon these universities it is very importnaturally that people abandon these universities because it is not just that they are anti israel and pro radical is lom is it theyre wildly left wing they have embraced in instrsectional idea of life that is deeply damaging to theamerican body politic i've been saying for twenty years people need remove their money from tese universities and glad that some people are finally catching on to all of that meanwhile in israel israel is gaining the upper hand in southern goza as well israel is taking over a major city in hon it is called conunus which is located in southern goza meanwhile cmas is literally firing rockets out of civilian set up israel sing up civilian air is wore civilians can go for safety and comss is immediately inbetting there and then firing rockets from those places shocker becaus this is what they do meanwhile even palstinians are not talking openly about how humanitarian aid being sent in the gossis being stolen by commassers an elderly palistinian woman saying this san alge zera again the shock is not that she saying is the shock is that alge zera allowd it to be broughdcasts usually alge zera again owned by cotar tries to cut this off and tidphon wooted in this a the adlis that that is showed owogo no angal says not all co here can not find anythng to yeuter drink says everybody is suffering we said the situation divicolt all that no aight is coming shoes all the aid goes to the tunnel's hundermen it does not reach all the nivot we came in from gosa city all the aid is meant for osimi'm not afraid of commasi'm talking o them as well all the aid reaches the gozisralei wosta i e a lot of aigt is coming in is being distributed this is what they say hat's the reporter an says no commas takes everything to their homes they can take me shoot me or do whatever they want to me again this is what israel has been saying is what israels ben sayings that we are sending in aid and then the first thing that happens is that the commass fighterers an terr steal it and then the interna tional commeni blames israel for not sentin enough ade which commass then steals and meanwhile the metia re doing comassis work yesterday israel released photos of israel is railly soldiers who had arrested and detained a bunch of comas terras who had surrenderd and photos were released of the surrender naturally seean then treated this as though this was terrible and evil apparently in intrucing the sagment sian ends phillmattingally open with new and disgusting images this morning showing the is really military detaining dozens of men and gozaseen stripp downs their underwar well actually it turns out that tom these people are all commass members they wre stripped to their underware because again they might have bombs on them they might have boms on them the the notion that israel is stripping randos down to their underwarer for no reason an justaresting them is silly but of course the meta are doing the work of e commass is what they all the time the u on by heway also doing the work of commas the united nations which is the most discusting organization on plant are truly an awful organization the uun security council is expected to meet to day to discuss the war on goz after secretary general on conio gutetes in a rare moo formelly urged the fifteen member council to use all its influence to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in the onclave buterras has in voked article ninety nine of the uan charter since being appointed is the first time he is done that the rule alows the on leader to bring any matter he believes threatens international piece and security to the security council oooo oo i invoke article two hundred seventy six ofe shot the fokgopya moron and that tha this this ridiculous nonsense where where guterres spends his days doing the work of commass is is just amazing in the fact that ayone takes the uan seriously is ridiculous as aly con the forn minister of israel says gutenris is ten years dangered world bees his request to activate article ninety nine and the call for a seasefire and gozic constitutes supports of kmmass and indorsemen of the murder of the elderly the obduction of babies in the rape of women any one who supports world piece must support the liberation of goza from commass that obviously is strue the matter whether it is true er nouththe youone is a terrible grosst place that is no shock at all meanwhile the bide administration is starting to recognize from the ton booboos one ofthose bobas by the way as when the bydadministration came into power they immediately decided they were going to d list the houthies in are onnian back terro group an yemen as a

thousand that is in two days the flood of ilegal emgrans continues it is not abating in any way shape or form meanwhile the bid a mnistration continues to not acquies to a bill that wuld include some border security changes to actually secure that border instead they are yelling at re publicans for a taching border securety messures to crane israel tih wan funding bill there sing it is really bad really terrible and in fact creenchomp here is i mean this takes truegall blaming republicans for the border crises that is taken place solely and completely bease of th bide administration here is creen schomp here republican a talk about a emigration reform tha talk about lorder security i the presiden on day one the present qitforan emigration policy ifor a comprehensive emigration legislation to start that conversation effecially to start negotiate on day one it is been three years and they have not been moving forward in good fate they have not been trying to get to a solution in good fate the system is broken we want a fine real solution the presidents ad yesterday youhe is rehe is willing to have a serious conversation aboup this but they thet wears the good fate we have been very very clear about a about the supplimental hiw mportnet as as you have saying the on be director has been pretty out pre out there onder different net works a making the case a an wanted ha things that a she hass said is that it is tunnying it is tuing hat we have gotten to this point i it is tunying that weave gotten to this pointand that republicans in congress a willing to give putten a a a gift the greatest giv that puttent could help could heop for that is what we are saying and they are playing chicken with all you have to do is signed of bal seing here your ring check inistry will will remember them harshly no histories can remember that you gis were adamen about leaving the border open tht you allowed you crane to wither that is what his sries can remember is it the easiest by partison bilt in history seriously as one super easy not because republicans love ad u crade but because repblicans are willing to sign off on that for a few more bord control guarantees andyou gas are no not going to do it why is your priority leaving the border open that is the question again republicans are willing to acquies to your desire for you ranade they want the israelate they want the ti wantede why are you guydes not willing to acquiesk on the order it is amazing mesurely it does mak you asked the question why do they want the border wide open why are they desperate to keep the border completely out of control why why is't they only want mere moneys they can trot process people and send them to the interior of the united states where they will ever be heard of again until democrats am to see them why why why dre you intent on doing that as uppose strengthening our laws with regard to the southern border but again thi's the entire bide administration this one here is the owen be director cholons a young saying that she is stunned republicans actually want a secure the border alongside you cranade we are always willing to have a conversation i but i believe pogis has been talking about this long enough and unhappy i that the question was called un fortunally i people who no mistakes who are supporters of you crane were suppotus of israel i decided to bu politics a had of our i natual security interest theyr frankly i i ir man stune by that why are you stun by that bagain this is all partin p again this that this naring in biding should be making himself truly he should be making the argument that in order to say fight terrorism you need to close the border is not it if bidan actually wanted to win the election the moderate position is on emigration it is closer to the rightling position down trump its winning on the emigration issue by leaves and bounds you knot could jobidon could do he could he could make this yiel and now would allow him t's actually go to the moderne american an tillissen i tryed to shut the order i'm doing my best iven signed to bill a by partisan bill with republican subort to do things on the boder and then he can go to his radical basin ta ise i did not want past the billbut you lase want ed the ucranade i wanted the ucranade we needed the ucranade hets a perfect wind for him and he refuses to take it that is how in hock to his own radical base e is to that called intersectunal colition it is a wild thing it is a wild ela i cannot imagine the political calculist going through the mindes of the bite administration i guess not much i uess how much the really bad at this truly truly awful at this already coming up we will jump into the vaunt to benchpirocia melbag because it is a friday

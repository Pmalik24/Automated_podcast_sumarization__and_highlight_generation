the men spir sho responsor by express v pn pretect your online privacy today an express ve pianzi com slashmen it is oure less broadcast of the year i wanted to do some summing up of twenty twenty three and some lessons moving forward for twenty twenty four over all twenty twenty three was pretty me year ma in the sense that are politics has only got more ugly in the sense that the economy has continued to plod along at bessed in the sense that foreign policy is now a complete tdumster fire ad predicted the begining of the year a ninety percent bad year i cam in a little low is ninety six per cent time predicting for twenty twenty four ninety nine per cent bad just to be safe none the less there is some lessons for all of us to learn and remember from twenty twenty three lessin number one when people say they are coming for your kids you should lessen in july twenty twenty one the san francisco gamen's choir sying uniquely honest song in an attempt to slap at social conservatives the choir created and posted a song in which they said they were quote coming for your children here is what this creepy song sounded ryour cogsomewat g tai na te e cwell that was true of course radical progressives believe the only way to created better world it is tript children a way from their parents idealogically to indoctrinate them in the ways of left wing social change to turn them into little activist then on exploding their parents values that is how you create a better world those progressives they are not new they spent generations taking over the schools the media the entertainment industry it is the reason why as we discusse earlier this week a new harvard heris pulshoes seventy nine per cent of people aged eighteen to twenty four in the united states believe they quote white people are oppressors and none what people and people of certain groups have beenoppressed and as result should be favored to day universities and for employment it is why sixty seven per cent of those same young people ble lieve that quil jews as a class are oppressors and should be treated as oppressors if you are wondering just why hundreds of thousands of young people lestern leftis are in the streets chancing for commoss that would be the reason why it is we are also wondering just whie twenty per cent of all young people now considered themselves l g b t ku plus minstovidaby sign that is also why generations of children have been hi jacked into a neel marksist pinary of oppressor verses oppressed and it is always better to identify as the oppressed then the oppressor makes you feel lopitr and gives you unending power to do anything you want after all ifs you are the oppressed you can do what ever you wantst the oppressor to free orself and liberate yourself recruiters for this perverse ideology start really young really really young that is why this week coco melon lane on etflics featured two gate ads seeching their son to put on a skirt and it tiara in the name of self fulfilment here is what that looked ylarv g the how valley grak out those who for tor t created thnd le o you notbuts h bo all thin iv just beyustitrintiti i ab othethinto tit just be ulds for context cocol mellans you two channel has a hundred seventy million subscribers and a hundred seventy three billion views yes the producers o vemost watch children's content in human history are coming for your kids too teach teaching them gender fluidity and exploding the idea of the traditional family structure there it is the educational system whether it is the media whether it is entertainment re lot of people who want to change how your children thinks that is less a number one they are coming for your kids and you should do something about it one of the reasons why we here at daily wire built an entire strimming out were called benkee s ind put your kids in front of children's programming that does not wreck their lives that actually reflects your values by that makes a great christmas gift whele i'm pitching it hat on over to bent kee dot com right now okey lessen number two from twentyt twenty three they are a lot of people who do not think you this something westerns have a really tough time with a lot of enlightment philosophy is based on the idea that everybody is basicaly the same all the same now obviously we are all equal in the eyes of god we 'll have innate human vally but we certainly do not think the same and the enlightenment idea that every single person wants the same things at roude that every single person regardless of culture regardless of education regardless as how they are brought up thinks sored of the same things that is a live and it is a stupid lie and it is a really dangerous live in twenty twenty three come oss slaughtered children in their crebs burn them alive raped women in front of teir husbands and then killed them or drag them off to goss after shoing teir husbands in the head and entire cotra of westerneris thought well it is probably because they were victimized in some way something must have happened to drive them to that because after all who would do that this is whi in this corn confoctine israel and commass wher comemos takestone children and uses them as human shields the west at least left is west desides that must be israel's fault somehow because afterall the people of commos they must think the same way that western left is to they must be driven to this sort of thing well there is another possibility and that is because commas does not think you theren have your priorities that she do not care about their children in the same way that you do or least in the way that you think that they should they have different priorities then you which is why they are fine with burning babies alive in their crebs and here is the thing pretending that people are all thinking you will get you killd people do not all want the same thing they do not all want freedom freedom does not beat in the brest of every human being as george dll be bushd once foolishly said that is not reality theyere lot of people who prizes for example religious fealty over freedom ther're a lot of people who prize government benefits overf ther're lot of people who prives a lot of different things in ways that that you do not prize thand that is wat you have to understand who they are in order to deal with them realistically this means thugh we must be realistic about our enemies on the foreign front obviously jobs are not consolve the problems that you have with comemoss or hesballa a peasmens is not going to solve the problems you have with the chinese government being realistic about your enemies reading what they teach their kids reading what they themselves think that is the best way to understand them rather than simply projecting your own thoughts on to them and ten assuming that if some thing makes them angry it must be you but i's not just being realistic about our enemies on the foreign front it also means we have to be realistic about many of the people who live with us fellow americans fellow westerners many of whom also do not want the same things that you do and what that really means is that we are going to have to have some ereamly surious discussions in this country about what holds us all together as the country feels its frang as i feels its coming apart wor enough to figure out what do we hold in common because if it turns out that people do not think you in the country that you live in you have a serious problem a very serious problem eget's a more on that in just one second first e tell you about being healthy this year thot be onse of you not coodabout u my fruits and veges but what i am much better about is taking my balance of

your first preferred order plus a free bottle of fiber and spice right now okit when you take a look at the problem people in the country who do not think you or enough start thinging pretty seriously about what holds us together now the very notion of free speech is not it because it turns out that free speech it is a it is an important principle but it also does not speak to what kind of speech is good a room in which any opinion is held is not eet a room that theoretically has a common value namely that any opinion should be allowedto be held but that is not enough to build a society upon you have to have a common vision of the good what exactly's gen hold ustogether is that the constitution and rule of law whell feels that is falling apart pretty quickly right now when ou hve the colorado states supreme court that is basically overthrowing the constitution and the rule of law in orde bardonal trumphon ballad is i n be the rule of law from the white house well not wloll theire promoting the violation of law with illegal executive orders and the doja bing militrizes against political opponents andas well discuss in a minute there iscan get back lash that that s can be just as ugly what else holds us together habout property rightsal a lot of the proma lot of the the country regt nout des not believe in propertyo rights by the way back to freespeach a huge per centage o the country does not actually believe in freesbe principales at all they believe thet people who disagree with them main line political opones forget about fringy people mainline political opponents should be silants we live in a country in which college campasses we will kick you off the campus fore saying that men are men and women are women and then the college precidents will lo testify in front of congress simultaneously about how it requires contect to truly understand in a serious way whether or not calling for genticide of jews is bad habout freedom of religion thae to be something that held us together whell now ther states therre actively targaning religious practice and as our institutions waine which was the glue that held us together galleas to go to church or synagog together we st have common events common culture what can hold us together then wess in number three weakness reeds a gression whey found this one out good and hard this year if america in the west go to sleep on our enemies our enemies take advantage theresthis pizour notion that'come quite prevalent on the left and on the right thatif america just goes to sleep and retreats into itself the rest of the world stays exactly the way that it was one moment to go and that is really really stupid it is not true if america abandons the world the world becomes significantly worse and that has real spill over for the united states not chest in terms of bad things happening all over the world becuse you can always close your eyes and pretend it does not effect you it is happening very far away but also in terms of how you live your life the economy which you do rely upon gets a lot worse your safety becomes a lot mor tenuas when i turns out their lot mor people around your borders who hte your gots if you go to sleep on your enemies they take advantage has been clear since jobide decided to ignominiously and cowardly fashion run away from afganistan in hand over the country to seventh century barbarians it is also tr by the way in you crane the reality is that thanks to barock obama and prior presidents and gooding george shall you bush basically doing very little when russia invaded georgia when russia invaded crimea and the don bas it turns out that that encourage russia to invade you cran its ben a lot o talk about how western militans created russia's invasion of you crane now western weakness created russia's invasion of you crane because of russia actually felt they were going to get clocked in severe fashion and lose the war that would not have entered the war this is what the torrents is based on as always there are basically two strategies when it comes to preemptively preventing a war one is appeasement and the other is to turn sose are the only two strategies available that really is no third now when it comes to intransigient enemies who do not the way that you live and have fundamental disagreements about how the world order shold be structured when it comes to those con tries only to options appeasement deturins there is no third isolation is generally a form of appeasemen deturints is where nobody walks across that border becausethey are afraid that they' can no get cloch ins next monday well when you run away from the world the world becomes worse is true in the gosistrip both israel and the united states we are weak with palistonian terrism both israel and the united states decided the commass could basically be contained and dealt with both israel in th united states were easy wat the palistonian authority they re lit on tecnology they are light on the idea that forcing israel into concessions to its terrorist enemies would somehow by peace appeasemen would be the preemptive anti war strategy rather then deterins and it turns out that broke down and it failed and that bred massive aggression and it is breeding more aggression right now for example a much more aggressive ron inthe midleleast the abomi administration spent years appeasing the aranians the trump administration push back the bid admnistration went back to appeasing the aranians and the first thing they did was gett militans o literally every border they have te et every single proxy group that they have from commass to cusballa in te north of israel to the hoothes here in fact is avidio that the whoo thes just releaset championing theire own militans in taking over ships from the red sea here is with that vit you looks as you can see these are ships woothe flags and palestinian flags and tit is the old palestine we have come with steadfaftness and bravery the strength of god is within us after taja and his family oll palestine we have com remember the country ot seven hundred dollars ce heper capital very poor country they' felld all these resources specifically to kille people and take overshippin ens the axis of all koods is coming o misguided masses the fulfilment of the promise of the hereafter and triumph of the message tand they do not think you the axis of all coods is coming a'll coods is om a reference toron omis guided masses the fulfillment of the promise of the hereafter and the triumph of the message and against to buncho rag tag pirates they can a crapy boats with some machine guns and it is a very well pretusvidio i will say they a ood jop wit the dron footage here is the problem if the luss uesn't blow them out of the water heyre gin to get even more aggression we get to that in just at one second we need o ramp up our efforts to save the lives of innocent babies i cannot strust this enough tbecause of our partnership with preeborn and organization dedicated to saving the lives of the unborn we can actually do with just that every day preborns nework of clinixs rescues two hundred babies as they compeate had to had with the abortion chines preeborn offers free alter sounds to moms sor considering abortion once these momsee their babiesing here the hartbeat theyare twice as likely too choose life and nowthro mash your tax deductable gift is doubled too because threeborn supports both moms and babies with dipers carseets councsly and more you are offering double blessings now is the time to put your yearand right off to work please double down sotak you'n it can do anything more important this year were hitting the end of the urnows in a maze sing time to do some good write at the end of the urgestile pound to fifty onorphone say keyward baby that is pounds two fives zero baby or do not ate securely af preborn dot com slash ben again at is preeborn dot com slashmen go checke him out ry now start saving lives to day everytime amaman sees for baban ultrasound it is going to ratically increase the chance hat that baby sees life justile pound to fifty inophone say keyward baby ok again when it comes to weakness it breeds aggression weakness in the redsey is going to breed aggression from china chinas already making noises about the possibility of taking twan i would say that if things keep going the way that they are i would tay the is better than oa fifty fifty shot the china attempts to make a more aggressive move against tiwan for example attempting to blockade tiwan and daring the west to break thap blockade at the risk of getting into a direct war with china and at the risk of china shutting down the tiwan straight or crating such trouble in the south china see that the world economy absolutelytanks in advance of an election you could certainly see china doing that while jobidon is president because they see that he is weak they see just as well as everyone else does that san francisco is literally a sesspool filled with human feces until the chinese president shows up at which point the dictator gets to see clean street and they clean up the streets for him a peesmen two china is going to breed more aggression this also tre by the way with regard to imigrasion weakness on our southern border means lots and lots of people are taking advantage which wis wy the bin administration has been seen by illegal imigrants the world over as a patsy it is why you see people chancing jobidon's name as they approach the southern border it is why your sing hundreds of thousands of people arriving at the southern border every month onprecedented levels waves of illegal imigrants other forms of weakness include multi culturalism multi cultural is in being the idea that there is no advance for senon advanced culture there is no better or worst culture that all cultures exist in a sort of luke warm meastma of mediocrity you cannot distinguish between them you should not discriminate between cultures but if you do not stand up for your own culture you end up importing extraordinary numbers of people watually hate yor culture and underminor culture it breeds aggression conversely strength means facing actual hard realities it means not backing down onyor pinciples even when that cost is insanely high this is why it is important that for example the west not cave just becaue war is ugly of course war is ugly hinew example of what bravery actually looks is the se just an astonishing story last week we covered what has been the worst story of the war for the israilies after october seventh hich was there are three hostages whore taken by commas and its civilian alis into the gossipstrip and these three hostages somehow gotloos and they put up a sign and hebrew that said we are hostages they apparently wore were free for three days or andthen they try to surrender to these raily troops their bar chusted and they r carrying white flags and tese really troops thought that they were probably terrorists because thetlis a trap this was not an area where hostages are supposed to be roaming free is r ave been dullt dealing with booby traps and bombs on bodies for a very long time in this war and these realy troops the idea shot these three hostages by acen killed them herrific story i want to read this larks this the canbravery it takes tactually win wars against and transgent evil enemies shere is a woman i iriscium she is the mother of one of the hostages whois kiled by the idea youtomheim and a she sent this message to these raily soldiers from that tratic instanent am ma translate it just hello this is it is cimi'm your tom's mother i wante to tell you that i love you very much and that i'm sending you my hugs from afar i know that everything that happen is not your fault at all it is no one's fault axcept for comas know that you are doing the greatest thing but in the world that could happen that could help us the people of israel and all of us need you belieto stay healthy gdo not hesitate even for a moment if you see a terrors do not thing to yourself that you killed uim a hostage deliberately we need to protect yourself because that is the only way you can protact os at the first opportunity you are invited to come to our home any one who can comigto our home we want to see you with our own eyes to hug you and tell you that you did everythng you could as much as it hurts to say it was the right thing not oneof us judges you not one of us are angry at you that is astonishing strength and that is the actual kind of strength it takes two defeat people who fundamentally wish to make the world in incredibly horrible place in just one second when ging to get to the fourth lesson of twenty twenty three first are you struggling with bax taxes or unfiled returns the ires is escalating collections by adding twenty thousand new agents in these challenging times your best dofence is to use tax network you essay with over fourteen years of experience tax that work you essay has save their clients over a billion dollars in back taxes they specializein negotiating wit the iress they aimtroduce your dat significantly tax that work you ussay does not just negotiate that protect our assets from ira seizures and manage your yearly returns for ongoing compliance importantly there lihense tell with all state tax issues regardless of where you live in the united states if you upon the aponiar taxes it can absolutely reckor life do not let that happen instead seize control of your financial future right now do not let those tax issues overpower you and recyou contact tax network you say for immediate relief and expert guidance call one eight hundred two four five six thousand or visit t n you ssay dot comslash apperol turn to tax network you essay find your path to financial piece of mind tats t n you say dod com slash chipuro again t n you ssay dod comslash appur or one eight hundred two four five six thousand oka we have talked about the first three lessons of twenty twenty three first when people say their coming fhirgins you should listen in do something about it two whist people do not actually think you and three we canness breeds aggression now lessen four what goes around comes around always and for ever if you do something to somebody else politically in the united states the chances are extremely hie that that is going to come back to haunt you when it comes to domestic politics democrats seem to be under the weird imprestion that playing with legal fire has no consequences that is a lie is an incredibly stupid lie the prosecutions of donalga trump litre gan to carry well into next year throughout the election cycle four separate prosecutions three of which are entirely spurious the new york prosecution of donal trump the washington dece prosecution of donal trump the georgia prosecution of donal trump all of those are deliberate misreads of the law and obvious miss reeds of the law they are stretches not only are they stretches there is don attempt to push them before the elections the trial actually happens before the election as to the oretically convicdonal trump before the election to effect the election the fourth case which is the closified documents case down in florida just by the statute trum violated the statiue also it happens to be that hele reclettan violated the same exac statute knowing cared an nown did anything in fact james comy specifically went out of his way to change the nature of the law its letter off the hook all of that rap together looks a political prosecution of trump an trub has ben making the case that the system is weaponized against hin and then the cherri was put on top of that particular sunday by the coller out of state supreme court this week which announced that donald trump could simply be removed from the ballet in primaries and the general election as a quonk uhat insurrectionist despite the fact that there is no definition of insurrectionist in law that donal trump has nopen convicted of or tried four insurrection even the cases in which is colnently tried do not allege violation of insurrection law the attempt to turn donald trump into the test case for this is totally insane furthermore when you issue exacutive orders that move well be on the constitution when you jobidon decide that you are going to yuse osha the occupational safety and hazards administration to cram down baxines on eighty million americans in violation of law when you use your pen in order to simply relieve student loned dabt when you do those things you are setting the stage for precisely the reverse to be done to you if you wish for republicans to abide by the law you cannot break the law if you wish for republicans not to abuse executive power you cannot abuse executive power once you open pandor's box the box is now open andthabox is open because republicans seem to think that if bad democratic behavior justifies republican reactionary bd behavior that is also totally fine things are goin to get worse because then democrats are going to take whatever republicans add on to the bad behavior and the thegin to at on to that bad behavior if democrats decide that they are going to tried to take downa trump post twenty sixteen with a series of lies that justifies donald trump lying about the law with regard to the twenty twenty election and suggesting that the vice president of te united state my pens had the unalateral ability to simply throughout certified votes and that the en justifies democrats reacting by abusing the law to bar trump from the ballad overtly or to prosecute him politically to stop him all of which will then justify donal trump denying the election results in twenty twenty four if he loses all of which will then justify riots and prosecutions we can see precisely where all of this is going the endless cycle of reactionary politics can only be stopped if somebody decides it not to be irreactionary and to be reasonable and to stop that is the only way but 's not just one side both sides have to stop he ais otherwise one side is unilaterally tisarming and here in lies the problem with our modern politics there is no concensus that both sides need to stop this there are too many democrats or out their celebrating barring donald trump from the balla there are too many democrats ore out thei're celebrating the political prosecutions of donald trump there are too many democrats are perfectly willing to watch jobidon be dictitorial in his presidency because he is member of their party andall that' can justify is similar but more action from the other side which will justify similar but more action from the other side the nature of american politics is incredibly reactionary at this penty time whil you really need is for both sides to go weapons down we all which goes bects the second lesson which as we better find some common ground pretty damned quickly or things are going to get really ugly really fast allot uglier even than they are right now which is why twenty twenty four is shaping up to just be adumster fire thay finally lessin number five from twenty twenty three in competence has consequences this is true for every one incompetence rules the roost we are now in a race to the bottom now on the left that incompetence is coming from the fact that the marytocracy is seen as a it is an imposition of power that is somehow if you are gooded things and you are successful tats not cause you'r good at things is cause you exploited some one and to the best thing that we can do is get rid of the marytocray and then ignore the incompetents the incompetence is now bled through to every area of our government jobidon is in competent i mean he is mentally incompetent at this point i mean here is vidio of jobidn literally yesterday randomly shuffling into curtains i'm telling you that the the joke from shane gos about him being a roombut is just true it is not even a joka any more here is jobido not finishin a speecher not knowing where to go because he is not he is non compos mentus there is he turne around he does not know where to go is just going to randamy smiling now on knows where where is he going random du tust to pop out from behind the curtain to give him some sort of direction as to where he is supposed to go where am i going still do not knowher i'm going no jo you are going therong way oh oh hooge trying to motor on over here o woman at the speedalwat ob jobidon not competent there is a reason is in the thirteasan apprulerating even less competent comell harris whois picked because she is incompetent she is nompect for being excellentat her job she is picke despite being crappy at her job because she is a d iye candidate she is a candidate who ise selected specifically by jobidon because she is a black woman not because she was goded her job she round one o the most incompetent presidential campaigns of all time she dropped out before her home state in an open primary as crazy athehundro ma orcus our homelyin security secretary wildly incompetent leaving the border fully open while maintaining that it is actually close secretary of transportation pete buddhijedge who loves chuthu trains that duede toke off for a couple monts and no one even noticed then he came back and none of the plans land on time and trains ore blowing up the levels of incompetents are astonishing democrats in the senate or wildly incompetent democrats in the house ore even more in competent they cannot even find it in their mamed hards to semd how condemne in the antisemitism of villhonomar and resheeted to leab but do not worry it is not to stemocrats republicans are also in competent republicans incomgress have decided to engage in an idiotic race to the bottom alsting a speaker of the house this year for no apparent reason to replacon with a person who ise just find by johnson but who is now insentifies by the exact same structures they will pass the exact same bills accept tha they are probably going to lose cevena carthy seed just really smart stuff happening right here in competence has been wild we rewarded on all sides of the political isle because there is something a really sixsee that has been buried in the american body politic in the ground and is worn ugly fruit and that seed is that if you fail your failure is some one else's fault this is true in terms of our agencies our agencies are wildly in competent on the state level as evidence by the malley fire where the state agencies not only did not to their environmental work they then did not even sound the alarms properly to let people get the hell out when everything was on fire our institutions are incompetent is hunchis government our institutions are in competent our churches ore wildly incompetent they are filled with people wh are abandoning eternal values the only reason o cuature their bandoning those eternal values in this bizar push to fill the pews with left wingers who do not actually worship god but worship a weird lon sign that is multi colored and says dumb crap water is wet the amount of incompetents throughout every elemen of our sidy is truly a problem especially because when people our face with in cometence they get mad now the normal reaction wo be get mad at the incompetents and then put competent people in power but we have forbidden that because we have created in entire ideology that bars getting rid of the incompetent people take for example are universities the best example of the day thas in amate it is a wonderful sorce o cloudin gay whos the president of harvard she of course as come under fire recently because she went n front of comgress an sh maden't ask of herself because she was asked whether in fact calling for the genicide of jews was violative of harvard student policy the answer is yes you should not be calling for the genicide of jews now if she had said we love free speecher and then ore ered actually did love free speech that might be in argument but then a' love fre speacher harvard they suck it free speech at harbard 's what she really meant is you can call for the gentlside of jews but prety much no other group well this then led to the opening of cloudian gaze past and it turns out that she is a garbage scholar who has plagerized in dozens of instances according to the near times harvard university in the face of mounting questions over possible plagurism in the scholarly work of its president clouding gay on wednesday it had found two additional instances bof insufficient citation in her work those issues were found in doctor gaze nineteen ninety seven doctoral discertation in which harvard said it had found two examples of what they called this amazing language you at you ready for some some incompetence covering readyr get ready for this language is not plagerism folks it is quote to plickative language without appropriate aptribution oh you mean plagiarism that is literally th definition of plagerism is amazing lterally te definition of the word plagurism is quote the practice of taking some one else's work or ideas and passing them off as one's own here is what harvard is now calling this practice there are now calling this practice again the phrase was do plickative language without appropriate attribution oh you mean copying some one's language without citing them which is stealing their language which is plagurism by the can'gatrat a clouding gay because you see cloudin gaze a black woman the first black woman present in the history of harvard mediocrity an in comptenc must be rewarded endlessly and those who call out mediocrity and failure those people are really the people to blame that the the comment of the year on this particular topic comes courtesy of a prson actually had for contracts when i was at harvard loss call charles freed says professor freedwhen i was there he is old thens he is really old now charles freed are not this is such an amazing quote he is a he he worked for for ragan whoas a solicitor general under ragan he was one of these supposed conservatives of the losscl but he as never particularly conservative he is always middle of the road politically at best here is what he said quote it is part of this extreme rightwing attack on he lead institutions the obvious point is to make it look as if there is a wok double standard an he lead institutions and then he says this here is the comment quote if it came from some other quarter i might be granting insome credents but not from these people that is right if you point out the incompetence but e ou're of the wrong political persuasion for chrisrufo and he points out the plagerism or if you are eransibarium nd you point out the plagerism then charles freed will not even take it under advisemens because again the precious must be protected it is more importante protect your ideological leanings than it is to protect any level of maritocracy in fact we built entire edifices videology to excuse in competence in failure on both sides we now find conspiracy theories to undermine the basic idea of merit on the left if you are failing it is because as stated before you are victimized by the weadopressors and this is a prevalent ideology particularly among young people seventy nine per cents people eighteen to twenty for agree with that that if you fail if you if you suck et life that is not because you made bad decisions it is because you are being victimize by some evil codray of people in the back groom whore screwing you on the right if you are failing it is also shockingly because of a codray of evil people in the back room who are screwing you maybe it is the hedge fun managers maybe it is the people who love free markets and maybe it is people who want to maximize profets instead of turning this all over to a bunch of government burocrats for government subsitization a particular electoral clicks understand that the theory of populism which is effectively speaking that your own failures are not under your own control ever ever ever that is modern populism at least then have to be that way b that iswhat it is right now that that theory breeds more in competence it makes the world worse more people fail and then because more people fail the beauty is that i's completely unfalsifiable system an theory as more people fail the answer is not oh maybe we got this wrong maybeou ought to promote merit it becomes whle that conspiracy theory man that must be true that conspiracy is strong and then becase you believe that conspiracy you do not get competent at things andthen you fail more than t all man every year it is getting worse hereis the reality the meritocracy is the great a meric an idea the maritocracy the idea that if you work card and if you are smart and if you make good moral decisions you will succeed that is the unique western beautiful idea it is the best idea maybe the best idea in all of human history because what it suggests is that if you make the right decisions you can crate positive externalities for everybody else see competence creates great externalities for everybody and makes the world better for every one you unmust bein competent in building cars makes better cars for you you unmusk sucking a building cars would be really bad and the same thing is true in every single job instrue every area of life we need competence in our goveryment we need competence in our institutions if we do not get competence things are likely to get worse and worse and then people will blame ironically the

it is getting at worse all the way across the mord perticularly bexan jo biding is wildly under performing indicators tht your bidns wildly under performing oper windfree who is a long time democrat devotay emashi she campaigned with berock obama ibolician dort jobi n last timeroun u shofs asked if she indorseis bidin this tim around and she is i'm going to walk slowly away by or eryoure oer co well els it is on i nevery ben the mao wwell by see later i love the chetion one answer the election hish the ga'm just i'm just here tos ut by now an oper whin free cannot get on board with lake of course i hate donald trump y love joubut oberwyn fre is a democrat obviously and i'm even she is not on board meanwhile even jobidan' supposed success is are now turning to failure we mention those student loane payments that he legally decided to approve and then got struck down by the supreme qart well now their back according to the wall street journal as millions of studentlone barrowers make payments this year for the first time since twenty twenty meny are grapling with maddening burocratic problems barrower suscribing waiting on hold for ours trying in failing to get answers rom their lon servicers some receive inaccurate or conflicting in formation about amounts ode and the stafts of their loans others heard barely anything at all only to be it with surprise bills the legistical morass which comes less than a year before the twenty twenty for election has complicated jobidan's efforts to insure the voter's credit him for slashing student debt bines initial plan to cancil up to twenty grand in federal student lon deat for people making less than a hundred twenty five thousand dollars a year was struck down by the suprimcort in june but that did not stop jo bid in since then the administration advanced narrower lone relief they wiped away a hundred and thirty to billion bollars and debt for three point six million barrwers and just keep going with the illigality but it turns out that even that is a bleep sho meanwhile even the education of partmen is noting the risks associated with transferring loans and messing around with all of this the education marman says these borrowers are atturning to a student lone system that is midstreamen making fundamental reforms to sudent lon servicing and barrower benefits it is a mess it is oncon to be grate for all those people who are lying on jobide an turns oth when you lie to people and then people discover the lives are not particuarly happy with you meanwhile jerome powel is soing confustion over at the federeserve again according t the wallstre journal federalreserve chair jerome powl was asked at a recent gathering what he does for fun he seid quote for me a really big party is a really god inflation repord but it does not matter because right now it is unclear exactly what the hell the fet is going to do officials last week did not rule out higher rates but jerome pallic nighted o market rally when he volunteer that sum officials described their own rate cut out looks even if that was not a central fogus it is unclear what exactly is coming out from the fet the markets believe that the fet is in a lower the rates again the fet as not made clear whether its going to leave them or even increase the rates if the inflation continues the way that it has all of this is leading to serious uncertainty interestrates could still be quite restrictive even ifor le adjust policy by lowering rates three times next year san francisco fed president mary daily pointed out in th interview on monday also it is ounclear exactly whether the intrestrates are going to stay up that in the fives for a while to gome sof jobide is hoping for the fed to completely save next year that does not look that is likely to happen he is down to his last resort which always and forever is the democracy is a threat if you allow tonal trumpet to be reelected that is the final case that all of these f ople are going to may its can mean nothing but threats ondermocracy from here to the election this is presumably why jacksmith continues to push forward a'd obviously politically motivated prosecution in washington t ce ton thursday smith file dey response to a motion by trump they would file demanding the court weight until a lower appeals court rules on the issue of presidential immunity they want a slow down the process the longer the process takes the longer it takes to get past the election smith wants to speed up the process what exactly is his excuse he says the public interests in a prompt resolution of this case faver's an immediate definitive decision by this court the charges here are of the utmost gravity this case involves criminal charges against to former presen an basted on his actions well an offices not just any actions alleged acts to purpeto perpetuate himself in power by frustrating the constitutionally prescribe process for certifying the lawful winner of an election the nation has compelling interest in a decision on respondent's claim of immunity from these charges and if they are to be tried a resolution by conviction or a quintal without undu delay why why i mean lheast these trials take years very often what is the big rush and we all know the big rush the big rush is for jacksmith to get a conviction in under the wires wose you damage dunnal trumps presidential chances in twenty twenty four in other words get ready for things to get really hot and really upsetting next year twenty twenty four it is gon m an electioneer electioners are usually exciting ah there isgoin to be the fresson of violence in the street that is that is going to be a thing that is is jst man i'm glad of live in florida and not californias all i can say to

at least fifteen people are rapported dad shot by a gunman from a balcony at the faculty of arts at the university of prague on thursday the g unmen was report by local media to have fallen off the roof iis going to brightbart he masterer was eliminated it said the reseveral deat and dozens of injured around that faculty of ours building at the university of prague apparently the presumeshuter had been interested in killing as many people as possible any shool shooting apparently was obsessed with school shootings all around the world yetapparently shot as father earlier in the day in a small village outside o prague police attempted to find the twenty for yourld afterward it discovered that he was schedual to give a lecture at the university on thursday afternoon instead he had what sounded a machine gun if you hear the sounds and he decided to open fire on randam innocent people apparently he was a history student wit the history of psychological problems it it is an absolutely terrible story obviously chekasthe check republic happins to be a place with significant gun control very very strungk un control in progue there is not much that really could be done to stop him he apparently had free rain with a view point above the areas that he was shooting at students were trying to hide on the balconies who as taken place on a high story of a building and see pictures men on the highstory building and students were tempting to claing to the ledge itself apparently one of the people actually fell from ledge and was killed in the fall its a herrific herrific story it is son just terrible stuff it is reminder that evil exist pretty much everywhere and once again is reminder that masshootings despite what the press will tell you is not in america only problem it is itis a problem anywhere you have people are mentally ill and have seriou psychological problems and violent psychological problems and you can obtain guns it is still possible to obtain guns even in places wtie significant gun control and there is no one there who could stop this guy because no one there had agun in respondse o came meanwhile an the israel commas war continues revelations every single day about the extent to which comass was honey combed throughout the gocestrip including at the hospitals in fact israel released avidio of the director of commal adwan hospital admitting that he was a comas commander member whose the director of a hospital admitting that he was a camas commander here he was doing just that under interrogation he said what is yourfulmen acoman mahammed hassan all cabut what is your neckname ablcasan what is your current position manager of the hospital manager of the cammal adnan hospital when did you join camss two thousand ten when his last time you did military tranting two thousand ten what is your rankin camass i midrank that is parall to brigadier general wittdescribe how comass uses your hospitl to hide military itimi those who are hidden officially which were coordinated than i know about according to rank they are the senior political officials teyre the seniors the military in svillian officials they had rooms which they hid in at the hospital that they see their ten days than the changed places the different place and then they left the ospital yes of course they ware hiding in the hospital and of course the leadership of these hospitals knew the re hiding the hospitals and yet all those leaders of the hospitals been quoted by the media as excellent sources on the human rict fiolations thet are happening in and round the hospital due to these railies it is absolutely insane am e truly crazy meanwhile he can always counts on small minded biggots toy readed on usen be see to completely miss the point by comparing what is going on in gossip to ruuanda and our foor 't places where actual genisides were attempted as oppose to very specific military operations that have according to isral killed upwards of eight thousand members of commass out of the twenty thousand deads far and by the way a huge number of the people where not in that eight thousand number our commoss fellow travellers weare hanging out with commass israels been more precis in its targaning than any army in modern history but toy read is comparing this to tar for and reanda presinen bodan has hitch a the global credibility of america ato the moral credibots he have bentren this in yogru and that is just the disastor forus around the world i think of dar for i think of for wanda i think of previous case as in which the i states of of watch seemingly helplessly as people died by thethe the the hundred s tof thousands and suseen of congo derocretic of public of congo but in this case unlike those cases this feels this as us doing it the human misery is being funded by e ni tik tact fars yet it does not seem that he was public opinion has any imfact well that is rit to think you hav public opinion thit simportint to note has shifted the loss on this i true a i think tis in the different place i then th the american political establishment is on this that of course is a former you estates parment official who left the state department because the tate department refuse to acquiesse to his procommass at viewpoints meanwhile the am an end to days show at least for the non paying members on with the field good guy of the year if there is only one good story the com out o twenty twenty three it is the it is the transformation of john fetderman into a raging moderate again it is an amazing story we we here e having libit of federmania here is what john fetderman said he said with regard to left wing purity test he said it is just a place where i'm not i dn't feel ihave left the label of progressive its just more than it is left me i'm not critical of some one i's progress if i believe it different things he says that a lot people have worped minds on his ros as i do find it confusing where the very left progressives in america do not seem to want support the only progressive nation in the region they really embraces the same kind of values i would expect mev want as society again john fetderman

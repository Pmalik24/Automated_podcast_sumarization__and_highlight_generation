a national hero do he treated and he did not just tweat he treated something unsayable now there are certain things that'v been deemed unsaable by every society usually those things cut at the very roote of that society incitement murder for example under mines the rule of law expressing support for enemies during time of war for example undermines the ability of the government to win victories swee can tell lot about a society by te kind of speech it actually seeks to ban in ireland that speech amounts to criticism of open immigration on thirsday three cads and woman were stab in a nife attack outside to school in ireland allegedly by n aljurian emigrant in his fifties with mental illness bystanders tackle the man but many irish citizens were fighting mat about the incident which they saw as indicative of the governments looseness about migrants entering the country from april twenty twenty two to april twenty twenty three ireland si sixteen year high of a hundred forty one thousand six hundred emmigrants including forty thousand new cranians increasing economic and security combine with that highlevel of migration put ireland on the path to conflagration riders clashed with the police they set vehicles on fire they looted was the largest riot in ireland in decades fthirty four people were arrested one police officer was seriously injured the prime minister the overadcar condemne the riots and quote waves of ignorance and criminality and sed quote those involved have brought shame on dublin brought shamon ireland and brought shame on their families and themselves this is not who we are this is not who we want to be and this is not who we will ever be what exactly did conerma greggerdo well he spent the past few days teating about the irish governments absurdly lacks in migration policies when the primeminister urged migrants to register to vote in ireland mac greggor twee t quote aimagine a mega power nation allowing this absolute foolishness imagine the united states this is the most preposterous ridiculous scheming attempt tat gaining votes this government has attempted yet a real showing of the lack of care they have for the common irish citizen as it stands they do not have my vote shame on them before the stabbing attacks mc greggor twe to quote ireland we are at war after the attacks in response to the irish garda commission or claiming that equote hooligan faction driven by far right ideologies behind the riot mc greggor twee to quoe innocent children ruthlessly stab by a mensally deranged non national and dublind ireland to day our chief of police had this to say on the riots in the aftrmath drue not good enough there is grave danger among us in ireland that should never be here in the first place and there has been zero action done to support the public in any way shape or form with this frightening fact not good enough make change or makeway ireland for he vic try god bless those attack to day we pray he then added you reap what you mc gregor also treeted that the stablish to be punished with torture and death he said quote any updane on the well being of those stab to day absolutely herrific scenes all day my stomach is termning with no action being taken at all during these ever more frequent events literally zero action taken whatsoever how to we expect an end to this we need reform we need action mc greggor did aut a compliment for the brazilian immerant would stop the nife attacks datint quote the working man is the real hero brovo to our brazilian brother in ireland working hard burning a living contributing tirish society this is it we love appreciate and respecto gratly thank you much ciobinecio your forever free to eat and my establishment then he said quote we are not losing any more of our women and children to sick and twisted people who should not even be in ireland in the first place call it what you want we do not care he stated that violence by the way hand qute achieve nothing toward fixing the issues we face he continued i do understand frustrations however and i do nderstand o move must be made to ensure the change we need is ushured in and fast and he added i'm in the process of arranging believe me i am waymore tactical and i have backing there will be changed in ireland mark by words the change needed now all this is passionate but it is standard anti mask migration retoric et it drue rebuke from ireland's deputy priminister mac chal martin who called mc gregor's statements wuote absolutely disgraceful and explain quote isolated voices that and voices that are essentially inciting heat and to it agree to some extent incitement are unatteptable what is happening now whle the irish police are now investigating conoma gregor for supposed dissemination of omline hatespeech what is that mean mli means that for the left in the west the unsalable thing also happens to be obviously true mask migration often presents a real threat to the cultural cohesion of nation and combined with generous welfare payments can endanger the socio economic status of an entire country this is the unsalable thing it is untable and candada and some of europe and in these places it cannot be prosecutable because it is dangerous but why should those comments be unsable why should they be dangerous because according to the left the world is made up of oppressers and oppressed there are no cultural differences they do not exist are not important only class differences exist and class differences oure reflections of economic exploitation that can only be cured by marxist redistributionist materialism diversity is our strength says the old saw never mind that according to harvard left wing sociologist rober butonum quote the only two things that go up as the diversity of your senses tract goes up our protest marches an telivision watching no no no diversity is our strength because the more migrants who arrive in your country a rich welfare state the more pressure there will be for class based change this is why we see the left wing nostrum tht when a culture war takes place that cultureis actually take it is crted by the ileat the real solidarity should be class based solidarity any other prorspective must be outlawed the pressious diversity is our strength must be protected it should be no surprise therefore that prime minist er f radcar spent the week en calling fror more hate speech las and at the same time also saying that the is rally hosages taken bacc mss had been quote lost not kidnapped lost he literally treated this is a da of enormous joy and relief for emilyhan that is one of the released hostages an innizen childs who was lost has now been found in return we breath the massive sive relief our prayers have been answered lost you do not youd lose a puppy because four ver rodcar to label commass what it is would be to acknowledge precisely the sorts of cultural difference the left cannot be alowed to acknowledge but here is the thing everybody knows those cultural differences exist and theyare a problem westerners are beginning to openly acknowledge precisely those cultural differences and they should as i unhersialee has pointed out from two thousand nine to two thousand twenty one some three million emmigrants have come to europe mostly from te midaelist in africa two thirds were mail eighty per cent runder the age of thirty five un surprisingly sexual coercion has become far more common place a cross europe in two thousand seventeen in germany for example sexual coercion and rape jumped forty one per cents between nineteen ninety seven and two thousand thirteen some one thousand four hundred children were sexually abused and rother him in the uka the medea refuse to even report the story because they believe that doing might causac quote spike in racism according to professor elexus jades report on the story quote several councillors interviewed believe that by opening up these issues they could be giving oxygen to rasist perspectives that might in turn attract exstrement political groups and threaten community cohesion remember noticing is what threatens community cohesion in the netherlands which ion hersalley had to leave thanks to threats from ratdical muslems of exactly the same milk who murder her fill making partner theovango intwo thousand four muslems represent at least five per cent of the population according to leont winter of the telegraph as of twenty seventeen non western emigrans in the netherlands and their children

girt wilders of the party for freedom finish first in last weeks parliamentary elections in the netherlands wilders has been a long time icon of the right in the netherlands he spent decades warning

next it a netherlands ecsat from the heavy hand of the pro mass migration european union he wants reduction in the overseese aid budget slashing to e funding curbing oventry to forei students he wants more police officers and sero tolerancs of crime is not just gird vilders in the netherlands from george malonian italy t victor orban and hungry to the fin's party in findlin to te sweden democrats europe is bucking against multi culturalism and europe should molti culturalism without assimilation to western values is a dramatic failure oddly though the meedia seemd to continue to press the idea that opposing mass migration from cultures that actually cannaheat the west well that just means generalized the unifobia it is all about rasism or is lamafobia whatever that is not true many of the same parties pushing against mass muslem migration oure incredibly projewish for example and back israel in its curn conflict with coms it' scertainly true a vilders who ise an israel supporter as george malony as victor orban as it turns out radicalmoslems do not jews they are not antisimatic and it turns out being promalti culturalism while promoting mass migration of radical muslems tvery often links up with antisematism while opposing mass migration tvery often amounts you fighting mantisematism when the mass migration is coming from countries where people generally hate jews but again reporting the truth on these issues means undercutting he left wing li the culture is not the problem class is and that is the unsaable forbidden thing but silencing is not can work for long as mogreggor is showin europeans are not going quietly into the multi cultural light an attempts to ram europeans who want to protect oir cultur back into the diversity is our strength box are doomed to fail and meanwhile over in britan there ware more procomas protests over the weeken as always there is a giant pro israel protests over th be get it was mainly ignored by the media tat a hundred thousan people showed up it was perfectly calm wis perfectly quiet no media coverage there was however a a wat of vile horassman taking place at the procomas protests here' some the footage from the proomas protest at which again monuments were defaced people were climing up on them e were slapping cameras out of the hands of cameraman here' some the astural footage and then we will get to even the reporters recognizing habad thisis eana er ofcourse mass pase treslik terrace era ea a i te pipopea whiles are assin out and iin here come some of the a there is sucha comes on procomasnects or slapping cameras out of their and meanwhile releasing smoke boms in the center of london is every week end in london now one british reporter explained what i was to actually cover the procomas rallies it turns out that the people at these rallies are not pertrically nice in the lastaurl i we the cameraman abauasaitici ti arely qui an a pasan experian an a gay on a canaway shouting ut as onc is n a pro costing from he would not go way wa tiptitn vansaa civis atapoin e jus i contyu what etat but it was vil facis ca masatra a grep of people ca ran is it shating asi i have to say it was very intimitating i was sha by the end of aam now one of the things that is amazing about this is that briton right now is caving sho these protestors as we saw just overthe last coup of leeks reci sunac laid off swell a braverman who is the home secretary for mentioning the same sort of stuff than many other members of the populous right are mentioning from france to germany to sweden to finnlan to italy to hungery he later off because of course the populace cannot be allowed to save the unsayable thing gerard baker points the sout of er the walster journal he says the culture were in the ucape between the people and the establishment ind which the people for a heady moment seized control ofer matters emigration national sovereignty friminal justice and the right not to be ashamed of their race or cultural heritage has ended the establihment appears to ave one last week to formal surrender papers were signed first reci sunac became prim minister a year ago after a pantsomin per formance by his ruling conservative party had asked to two predecessors in quick succession brought back into government david cameron the man who ininvertently fired the first shot in the populous revolt by calling the rough friend mon brexet seven years ago if you wanted a caricature of the english establishment there is none better than mister cameron mister cameron is not just the man who in sisted the bitish people and dorst membership in the uon the pan of economic punishment he also bosteod of having inaugrated a golden age of relations between the uk and the peoples republic of china now he is forein secretary charge with leading britans international relations this of course coincided with soonot getting rid of braverman braverman is a much less polls figure than than is mister cameron after the political cas of last yearshou merge as the most outspoken advocate of a toughfer approached emigration crime and the woke mine vitors in the public set sectors staunchly proisrael she is also been extremely critical of the brish police force as tolerance of the offan violen procomost demonstrators on the streets in britaon you can be arrested for silently saying a prayer within a few hundred yards of anabortionclinic be can calle for the destruction of this ral and praise it o fitler and the boys in blue will insure that you are allwed to screamer bile unimpeded well she was fired and instead cameron was elevated is that going to last is that going to be a thing that the right is going to withstand in britan i really really doubted because as it turns out polling dated tends to show that the rise of populism that is happening all over the world actually has less to do with the reteric and much more to do wit the actual policies that is particularly true when it comes to emigration the vast majority of people in western countries are not particularly interested in importing vast numbers people who do not their country it is one thing to say as many people say that if people want a comon to the united states for example for the economic opportunity assimilate to american values love the flag love the constitution grat were were glad to have you in fact thit trade you for a bunch people on the other side ofthe political il on harpy but when it comes to people who are coming here and despise the country who openly hate the country or who are just here for the welfare benefits wy exactly should those people be allowed in if the west ignores that there an get more of what they are seing electorally the conservative party in britan is gon efface the same fate that many of the wrt wing parties or sentorite parties in therast of europe hatase which is cooption by elements thete are more wright wing than they are particularly on the emigration issue because here is the thing you can pretend the cultural differences do not exist but they do there is an entire european mine sat that suggests of course that cultural differences as we have suggested our a figment of the imagination that underneath everybody is exactly the thin they think the same way they 'll think westerners they 'll think western liberals to be more exact and that really if they evince sins antitematism or or hatred of women or hatred of rights really that is because of their economic dispossession in the infamous words of barako bama at one point talking about terrorism what people really need is jobs if we were just able to get them some sort of economic growth this would magically cure the cultural diferentiation better welfare benefits would make everything all better except that is not true and ave ready knows that is not true not only is not it true it happens to be a recipe for both economic down turns as well as cultural decay people increasingly across europe are recognizing this and people had better recognize this becaue otherwise the badguides are going to win now the media are fully dedicated to this narrative of course the medy are goin to continued to press that narrative over and over and over that to point out that cultures are not immediately cognizible as the same is two be rasis or horrifing but that that that simply cannot stand it simply can stand to campt with stand widay and what what is to actually happening is as the media continue to promote that line as they continue to claim a moral equivalentbin everybody on earth in order to degrade the west more and more people are seen to rectly through it more more people recognize exactly what is the game that they are playing the're becoming more more discredited and then they wine about hove they'r being discredited to take the latest example over the wek end there isbeen the series of massive hostage exchanges between a commass and israel o this weak end salcomossreleas some of the two hundred forty hostages hat the terra group took during its mass killing sprian onoctober seventh there least thirteen is really hossages the first day thas friday thirteen more hostages on saturday seventeen hosstages on sunday bringing the currentotal to forty three hostages runder the cur in brigan operations commoss os sets release fifty total hostages the deal could be extended by one day for every ten more hostages released why did the deal happen in the first place lawn israel side the reason is pretty obvious israel values the life of it citizens in a way the commass simply does not in fact israel is willing to put its own soldiers that additional risk in order to achieve the return of civilians and by the way even in order to protect palistinian cevilians many of whom participated in the octoberseve of the tat because again reminder isrel has complete irosuperiority over gaza they could bomb the place into tootal submission if israel wanted to do for israel the deal was painful but clear try to get out as many hossages as possible even if comass would be temporarily strengthen meanwhile what is comoss looking f ort whle they are looking for a breather commass has ben albsolutely pummelled it is leadership class has been largely liminated it is operations in northern goss have been devastated commass wants a few benefits from the temporary seas fire first a break to regroup possibly plane tno operations second more fuel to enhance the possibility of their survival and this is te most important one they want time to try to convince the world tha israel ought to leave them in tact that israel's campaign against commass ought to stop i gain that last point is th most crucial commss once the rest of the world to buy the narrative that commass is in fact a reasonable actor or as we have said the left wing notion that commass israel there no different underneath all the same it is just exploitation it just colonization nall the rest now that 's a rity hard cell after you hang glide into israel tand murderrly three hundred people at a music festival gho house to house to burn babyes intheir gribs and raped their mons and slaughter civilions at well because here is at that commas did not even just engage in murder of civilians they engaged in some of the worst atrocities in modern history according to one heis railly reserve combat paramatic is report by the washington post he found the corpses of two tean age girls in their bedrooms quote one was on a bad her arm was dangling from that the bed frame her legs were bare with bruises sh hd a bullet hole in the chest neck area the other was lying on the floor on her stomach her legs spread her pands pulled down toward her knees there wis a liquid on her back that look seamen sho shot in the back of the head according to a volunteer at the sura military morgue which was analyzing the bodies of the slain quote we saw many women with bloody underware broken bones broken legs broken pelvases another witness described the gang rape at the noval rabe followed by the murder of victim quote he did not pick up his pands he shot her well inside her ya i's tuff to turn commas into israel's moral equivalent but the goodness for ommas they never have to do their uwnselling as always their fellow travellers in the coalition of the oppressed including their cheer leaders in th legacy mee dea to it for them the leggasy media have no regrets in their procomas coverage over the course tofe last yew weeks in fact they admit as much here for example was the baby sees international editor claming that the baby se is bee doing a stellar job despite provoking inter national riots on behalf of commass thanks to lies and false reporting about supposed is railly human rades violations shere is the baby ses international etters and we have done an amazing job a gotmusky about the hospital i sensi to sii was ye the baby see was criticized heavily fi's reportsing a that thing tells what happen that night and in a bluntly wey cul gettin your information undo you regret anything that you said that night a broken i spos mid evening he dons e question thow i didn regret one thing a miporsing because i think i thing as masen th did not rise tustmen but you said that building av been flatons oh ye i a ta wront because i's looking at the pictures i li but i coun se was a square that a pip to be flaming anol s ines and there wis a w o avoid in the middle and it was i think it as a pito thing from a dran and y we have to piece together what we see the media are not backing down from their procomase of propaganda not one iota to even as this hostage deal when through for example one el be sea reporter again british reporter asked in is really spokes person whether the unevenness of the exchange fremember here is the exchange israel supposed to get back fifty of its own hosages and their relesing one hundred and fifty terrorists sutch a three one ratio of israel releasing three terrors for every innocenct is raily this reporter literally asked he is really spokes person whether that exchange rate represented israels disregard for palistinian life because it was a three for one rate i was thinking to a hostace negotiation this morning he made the comparison between the fifty hostachsis hostaces tha hamas has promised am promised to release i supposed to the hundred and fifty prisoners that a polistinians that isral has said that it will release and he made the cocomparison between the numbers and the fact that just this al not think that polistinian lives aboliitis highly as is radilots that is an astonishing accusation if we could releuse that ones presonough for every one hostage we wuld obviously do that we are aperating in horific circumstances we e not choosing to release these prisones tho have blood on the hands we are talking about people who have been convicted of stopping and shooting attacks notice the question of proportionality does not interest polestinian support is when they are able to get more of that prisoners out but really it is outrageous to suggests that the fact that we are willing to release prisoners in the convicted of terrorism oftances more of them than we are getting our own inno sent children back some hou suggest that we do not care about polistinian lifes really that is a disgusting accusation it is a particularly stoupid question but the most common idiotic massage of the weekan was actually parreted all over the leggacy media that somehow there is moral equivalente between israel releasing terrorists and comossraleasing showe is is something legacy media are actively promoting let us start with the actual fact every single person commass is releasing is an innocent person every single person israel is releasing is a criminal here is a chart of the palistonian released prisoners grouped by their actions fifteen per cent through stones at is raily soldiers eight per cent were involved in stabing attacks ten per cent were involved in shootng attacks six point four per centin other violences terroris contact eleven per cent s terrorst attempt fourteen point four per cent twelve point four percent malet of coctels ten points on percent explosives only eleven per cent others but even those people were associated with terrorism any the it is made a caso who exactly are these convects again are not to just tell you from the chart here is the vidio of some of these terrorist who release what they actually did here is one woman a shos release she is an innocent woman right an ncent one being held hostage by israel om except for she actively stabs this police o watch the tape she goes after with the knife here is another here is another woman she is carrying a knife above her head trying to stab a police officer here are two terras chasing police officer wt knives here is the police officer here is a palsing in just stabbing round o person there is wone of the terrace litteraly taking his man crashing into a police officer and then trying to stab him a car attack jumps out wit the knife a knife attack if these these are the people that the medi are portraying as equivalents to these rally hostares being released again these r pople who are literally attempting to stab and murder people that is who is in is rally prisons now those terrors far being released are immediately being greeted with walkis chering by commossuporters not in the gosa stripe in judan smarry the west bank this was tape from ramala this weeken the're liteally firing fireworks ind celebration at terros being releaced back into their community because these are heroes in the palsinian community people who attempt to murder jews not just police us lic random jews in fact how innocent were the people whoere release well the released prisoners themselves immediately dawn comas head gear and they pladged to renew their terrast efforts again theyare literat they literally put on the commass head bands andam and then swore that they would rejoin the fight whose oure terorists where an comasgier mas celebration f trereleace of terrists i get andam here are 'm here is one of the persons who was released calling formore jewish blood ar ctate this lady who is a terrace she is an we are the sword of mohammed at dive he is the a military leader of commass s that is on the one side meanwhile here is some tape of his rally children being released to their parents if those parent survived some of these kids have no parents because com ass actively murdered them can seees are kids being delivered back into the arms of their family afte being held hostage for fifty days exactly the same exact moral equivalents cormedia exactly the same th is cychled violence in all that it is ridiculous ian sick to make any sort of equation here but of course that the entire game n the media or playing by the way some ofthese hostages for example want one of these one of these hostages she was told upon her release that her father is still being held by comas carn monder there is a four year old child in american whoas released both her parents ar dad and the're both murdered by comass she she had to be told that upon release i'm sure that her parents are ded now can you see the difference between the two sides by the way eve in omass release the hostages they still play games families were suppera the're stilbing separated the international red cross was originally to night agreed upon access the remaining hostages hostage release has been delade into the very last minute hostages were told to pose for the cameras by comass terrorists thereis some of that footage wer he can see in this vidia an litterally say keep waven keep waving their telling them to keep waving and smiling for the cameras gay believe oere not comss propagandis spent the wekcan trying to argue that this footits right here of the little girl being released was it actually evidence that comas had treated these prisoners decently that they were really really happy with their captors wo mean except for them being held at gun point for fifty days and i an essentially quasy starved and essentially a in one o them's basitly died here is one of the hostages she is an eghty four yeur old woman in such poorship should be met ov act immediately she is currently in the icy you an aten an a threaten atay niesin yat that shel a sheesn gre connition im the comasster f their very nice people how did the media play the obvious moral and balance against part of the broader a tampst morally equivocate between the last and his enemies how di they do this well they tempted to claim that israel was also holding innocent people rather than terrace nowas who have shown that is not true but here is a sky news reporter making just that claim then you would agree that to day was kgiven the circumstances a success we sol the tese five kickin at seven ofclock and that we sol the hostages release lace re the oftenin and of course you have now release thirty nine holistenan women and children to o le ai dont the a a o na as to abl to n ao yi acand tot that thing because it is they release children an we release children an say done except that te we have a two year old a a a a four year old a sive yorden an on yearold how can we compare that with a mino who is sixteen or seventeen years old who is involved in this steving at thac or o or a throwing a picturo bold or the other acts of violence you can say women and mines but to compare that to the srady two year old i think it is the bridgh too far that is the bridge sho farits sick but unfortunately this is what the media do and your times headline for example obscured that a woman in this particular picture is actually a terrorist o cas the headline is a disfigured woman whose caseis become well known is among the palicinians released wile disfigured who dis wow that terrible disfigured woman being hel by the srailies terrible well i'm there is only one problem the reason that she is disfigured is because she attempted to blow up a carbom and the battery assid hid her that is the reason she she disfigured herself she dis figured herself she is arrested after her car exploded at a check point did it did just did just manimly explode there ranamly explode or was it a carbom here is a seean anjournalis similarly claiming moral parity between small children released by commase thanks to israel's military pressure and palcinians released by israel in order to free those children a is rade authorities bloctoff roads corralled the media into one location an brought to the palesthinians in a through the bacdor when they received them and than only allowed family mamves to come in very limited single file and individual cause and as a reason for that because unlike a the images of celebration where you which she might have seen from romala an the west bank here in eas tereslem is radi authorites were better able to inforse the dictat o thet far right national security minister who has who has gleamed the prisoners release to day as taris bhen not jus nt he sad any palen them in who celebrates will themselves be change tays taris i mean just to break dot break break that down a little bit there is no grounds to call the taris because by israel's own reckoning those thirti in prisoners wer a fifteen miners ten of whom were only charge in twenty four women twenty three what sight were detan not charge and ten of the minirs with his handul chot u th for for terrism that is why there were detaiined for stabbi attacks and throwing mols of cartail of course the assenine ghaded did the same thing using as her model a victimon when achmed a monsara accusing israel of taking children is pe a double use engaging abduction rape humiliation torture murder of palceanans she treated out israels the only country in the world that keeps children is prisoners of war rit that children is prisoners wor obduction rape humiliation torture murder of palst inians years in years before october sevent achmadale monsar obducted by thes rally occupation the age of twelve has en jured solitary confinement hundreds of palsining children remaind detaind suffering this raily tails im here is an atural the doe of what ochmed did that would be ochmed chasing jews tord a am tordagasstation running into the asstation with the knife looking for somebody to stab and then them settling eventually on na they the eventual is settled hn the other personies with settled on the murder of a a thirteen year old boy that is the game its always the same game you pretend moral parity between israel and its enemies to ignore all evidence in order to accomplish this this allows for the continuation of that eggregiously false narrative that israel's elimination is legitimac goal or thae israel ought to be forced to make concessions to terrist gruws which are by the way the only governing powers in the west bank and the gaza strip fata for example is the military wing of te palstinian authority it isrun by machmood abas that is suppose to be israel's peace pardner that is the person jobidon wants to see running at gasa after commas well over the weaken the secretary general of fatasit central committee shu burajub stated that october seventh was quote in act in the context of the defensive war are people are waging tand thatcquote commas is part of our political and social fabric and of our struggle the're involvement is important ersub also said that commas is onsva quote fwarded the goal of the israily right to insegrate israel into the region without resolving the palstinian issue thased on the principle of peace in exchange for peace those are the moderates the non moderates spend the week and murdering and mutilating the bodies of two supposed collaborators with israel there are some of the images of that a trocity is literally palistinians they they executed two men and mutilated teir bodies in front of giant crowds mutilated them and they hangd them ut tpeople shouting cheering notice the selphones on notice the cheering and here and again lies the problem if there is no moral parity there can be no two states solution under these circumstances not remotely not with komas now at the p now i palsinian is loncihad now with any of the parties on the table and that is not likely to change any time soon what are the legasymediate to do wil thy 've a few options left when the narrative that comas is kind to the old women in kids they have kidnaped dosn't fly a farese they can argue the commas has no agency after all their realyve victims of circumstance in fact as it turns out israel is to blame for commas after all only the jews have agency thus according to steefhendrics and hasama bolusha of the washington post by ways it than alla that is disgrace itself beyond measure as a commas propaganda allet during this conflict they say the real false here is wait for it benjamin it tonahous the israly priminister according to the washington post nittinahuan commasquote found each other useful for their own purposes nintinaho pursuid o strategy that did not distrupt the statust quo of adivided palstinian population leaving comas to ruling gaza and the rival palistinian authority in the west bank weave aside the fact that had israel moved to depose comas over the pastwenty years the world would have condemned them fort in fact everytime israel went in to clean out commas actors the world cons emned them leave aside the fact that the palstinian authority currently allies with commas in is also a terrorist group the insane bigotry of suggesting that the jews are responsible for radical muzle matrocities because they did not defang those radical muzlims while you are currently arguing by the way that israel ought not tofan comas is totally mine bogling just to get the slocic straiht bb is bad because he did not doppose commass bb therefore must not doppose commass right now ocan then welf that argument does not work you can argue as the pressmen doing for weeks that israels wre taligation against commass its just as evil as commass 's original attaks thus we seen story after story condemning israel for not having magic weapons that only hiterrus even whenless terrase hide among civilians pushing this idiotic argument it center of chrismurphy of connecticut here hit was over the wecan on stated the union wy i stand by what i said i do believe that the level of civilian harm inside gaza has been a unacceptable and is unsustainable i think there is both a moral cost to this manye civilians innocent civilians children often losing their life but i think there is a stratigia cost ultimately hamoswell get stronger not weaker in the long run if all of this civilian death a allows them to a recruit more effectively inably a inside gaza well i mean obviously obviously he is an experat on this sort of stop and an if israel does not use its magic weapon well then israel's really really bad naturally murphy then connects this idiotic argument with the argument that isrel ought o make concessions the palstinans after all which is what they did in goza and are now being blamed by the washington post for doing here is murphy saying all the only way out of this is for israel to give more after they had all their citizens slaughterd the only future that guarantes the survival of a jewistate in the mittaleast and that is a palistinian state a benjamen ania believed that you could ignore the palstinians that you could try to squash their desires for estate and ultimately that would bring piece to the region in israel that is just not the case ultimately a the next government is going to have to put us back on a path to have a palstinin state that is not easy but it is the only way forit for israel is the only way forward for long turn piece y ive questionmhen he says it is not easy the reason it is not easy is because no palistinian govern mental body has ever accepted a piesteal ever in history oslol was a framework for the development of a pecedeal and it was then reject id by the palisinian's multltimes now thes passid smeltus but it does not have to again it is all merely the predicat to a more subtle argument that israel should be pressure to stop now if israel does stoplet to be perfectly clear about this the hostage deel becomes awful in refh respect israel cannot stop israel has to wipe out commass if comas emerges in tak israel will be seen as weak in decisive absolutely incapable of defending their own citizens israel has retinely destroyed a lot of the military power of terror sgrups in surrounding areas but long as those groups arevive the immediately claime victory and then they wegrow israel cannot allow that what is more israel s to the beginning at not the end of this battle nit is now who seit over the week and quet we have three goals for this war t limin any commass returning our hostages ensuring gasa dis not become a thrat to the stat of hisrael again the conflict in gosa is not over but it is not just in gaza isr il is going to have to over the coming years take on and destroy kes ballah on its northern border their curnently thirty thousand is railies whe have left their homes in northern israel because the 're under the umbrella of a terrors threat created by has balla that is the aronian bac teragroup that has right now to hundred thousand rockets minnimum pointed it israel perhaps fifty thousand wich have actual sophisticated targoting systems caus ballah cannot be left to stoope for that long especially given the aranean development of a nuwcleor weapon iveron develops t nucliar weapon they simply handed over the cas ballaw and then kis balla has the ability do prety much what they want and then there is the called west bank where the palicinan authority remember israels supposed pcar partner the p a is pathetically weak israel is going to have to engage in continuaing counter in surgeons e tactics both gaza and the west bank in definitely in order to insure safety and security willthe west allow is ral to do what it hase to do to protect its own security that is the big question moving forward and that question is gain connected to the broader question that many people are asking now in the west will the west t do what it has to do to protect itsell and its own security from the threat of radical is

open one not just internally but with regard to foreign policy for example when it comes to foreign policy the a sumption of weakness by the west is what drives america's enemies to becomes stronger and more militan this is why presumably over the weekg and china's military said it had driven youusts worship from waters it claims in the south chinasee and accuse the united states of quoe being the biggest destroyer of pece and stability in the region soa that means that that meting between shuchianpang and jrobidon went absolutely swimmingly in san francisco it was not seen his weakness by he chinese at all to put out a som nambulan president of the united states a barely sentien person a table cloth to to actually talk to the chinese dictator chinas staterun people's daily quoted senior cernal tiana sunlee he spokes person for the people's liberation army southern theater command as saying the guided missile destroyer yesas hopper had entered chinas territorial waters legally on saturday it said the incident occurred near the parasel islands which china alls the ssha islands ten sharply criticized the united states claiming tho us had violated chinese soveregnty tensions ramping up with china that of course is no surprise meanwhile american sailors did do something amazing over the week end the the tanker that was seize by yeminy rebels last week s notn is raily tanker but it does have investment from in is raily billioner that tanker as seezed by the hoothies last week will now apparently it was freed by us worship and now it is safe that is good bease if the international waterways are impinged upon by pirates and terroris all of your costrian go up pretty dramatically at home again in unstable world is a dramatically worse world for american citizens and america being the global hedgemon is the only party at is capable of providing safety in stability all over the world for economic trade lanes for example but the thing that under cuts that is continuing shilly shallying over things shudcomas survives to democrats continue radical democrats continue to push jobiding into pressuring israel oncomass according to the washington post earlier this month a group ofabout twenty distrust white house staffers requested a meeting with present bidnstop advizers as his rills warren gossa entered at six week the diverse group of staffers divers had it is three man issues they wanted to discuss with white house chief of staff cetons former advisar needed done and deputy national security viserjohn finer they wanted to know the administrations stratagy for curbing cevilian deaths the message plans sent on the conflict and its postwar vision for the region zense done and finer listend respectfully but someparts to spens te felt they fell back on familiar talking points ait a white house official familiar with a meeting sagain what this is is an attempt to drive bidneanso the arms of comas that is the and biding is susceptible to thes sort of stuff he is apparently there was a m there is a private meeting that he held with prominent muslem americans and a he apologize to members of the muslem community why ell because at one point he would been assed about the numberis coming out of gaza with regard to civilian death and he is had in' believe the numbers coming from komoss which is the proper answer giving the comoss routinele lives about said numbers and apparently bidan apologize for those commons quote i'm sorry i'm disappointed in myself i will do better a this pathetic it is pathetic it remains pathetic but again this is a way for the radical left inside the by administrations pushedubi that is can have significant ramifications for the american people because a weak america on the world stage is a real problem for american security ghis by the way bou just another reason why jobidons poles cou gtting worse and worse according to politico president inbidens poll numbers keep getting worse among the latest service this month from thirteen supper polsters bidonsposition is worse then their previous poles in all but two of those poles ad while poles suggjest most of the mo movement comes from voters abandoning bidin the donal trump is also start to gain steem trumps vote share in the national polling averages hirer now that at any point in the last year the state level data are just as striking in addition to new york times santa poles within last wee can halve other servecs have shown trumpahad by eight in arizona and five in michigan again he he is losing sum young voters right now trump according to the enbusenews poll is eshuall leading bidon among voters younger than thirty five forty six to forty two that is within the margin of error for that group but botom line is that jobidon is losing approval why becaus he feels the world is on fire if yfeels the worlds on firebic's jobidon is week and when weakness is evidence by the world ill turns out that people do really bad things meanwhile ye you can see the writing on the wall a little but here apparently they are a huge nar thirty nine members of congress who have already said they are planning to leave their seats twenty five of those members of congress are democrats lot of donocrats are seeing the writing on the wall in the next house election especially if jobidan has reverse cottails mean if he is the guide the top the ballot and he under performs that is a massive massive problem for democrats meanwhile donald trump went to south carolina an attempt to blunt the momentum that nike haley has beenattempting to build and tom he went t this college wripp bogam in south carolina and he was widely cheere who is funny to watch as people on twetter tried to treat this as donal trumping bood ah i'm not sure you are watching the same take the restpusor o nohernal lot of os there and in south carolina downns trump is a praety popular guy if donal trumpch as runs this campagn he literally walks out and stands there he will win really that is al the us to do just be quiet walk out stand theire leave if he does that he will win because the truth is the electric is treating trump believe ofre not they are treating trump leck teneric republican suresly that that is the real answer here yes trump as hi negatives with democrats does every genaric republican pretty much everybody is treating trump becaue they have seen him before and they know what he is and they know he says wild stuff and the allso know he is cen of a generic republican politician in trurms of his actual policy despite all the wild statements and the public is treating him that generic republican against jobidon wins the next election cycl and everybody istarting to realize that pretty quickly here o gat in just one second we will be getting to this insane story deric shoven who is the person convicted for the killing of george floid was stabbed in prison nearly to death if yofre not a member become member used coach paro

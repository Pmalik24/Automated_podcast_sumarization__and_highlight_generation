welcome to the huberman laponcas s u science science tace to s fri man your hubermen and our professor of nerbiology and opthemology at stanford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor david lynden doctor david linden is a professor of nero science at john's hopkins school of medicine his laboratory has studied nerl plasticity that is how connections in the brain change in response to experience much of that work focused on a structure called the serabellum which is also sometimes referred to as the many brain because it looks a many brain in the bottom and back of the human brain and its responsible for an enormous number of basic functions that we use in everyday life including our motor behavior that is our ability to walk and talk but also dance play instruments and its responsible for an enormous number of basic functions that we use in everyday life including our sense of balance our ability to learn new motor behaviors as well as our sense of timing to day we will discuss the sarabellumen what it does but doctor david linden will also teach us about the important sense of touch as well as what makes us different as individuals the reason to day's discussion encompasses many important topics is that doctor david linden's laboratory has focust on many of those topics and he is also the author of five excellent popular books about neurg science that focus on for instance our sense of pleasure in where it originates from in what controls it in the brain as well as our sense of touch and today we start off our discussion by talking about the recent discovery of a set of nurons that have been known about for a long period of time but that only recently have been characterize that are involved in sensual touch in particular in its a fascinating conversation i assure you in addition to that doctor david linden informs us about what makes us individuals how each an every one of us perceives the same things differently and its an absolutely fascinating conversation which tells you for instance why some of you think a sme l is putrid indeed smells vomit were as others perhaps are not bothered by that smell and why others still are attracted to that smell or something that you look at or something that you hear we also talk about nature versis nurture and how we come to be who we are notcist through our genes and epigenetics but also through our early child hoo experience and adult experience and then in the latter third of our conversation we shift to talking about the called mind body connection and the science underlying how our thoughts inform our bodily health or lack thereof as well as how the organs of our body controll the chemical hormones and thoughts within our brain then we shift to discussing doctor david lindand himself and the fact that in twenty twenty he was diagnosed with a form of heart cancer that led his physicians to tell him that he had six to twelve months to live now obviously because he was in our studio to record this conversation he has outlived that prognosis but he lives day to day with the knowledge that his death may very well come soon although it is not clear exactly when that day will come of course he tells us how the initial prognosis of his cancer as well as outliving that prognosis has informed his dailyday life as well as his thinking and his relationships nd that leads to a very direct and frankly emotional conversation that includes advice on how all of us can get the most out of our daily living and out of our over all life it is an extremely powerful conversation that i believe everyone regardless of age or health status can benefit from and it is one that makes clear that not only as doctor david linden a spectacular scientist but also a spectacular educator a spectacular popular writer a spectacular family man including husband and father and friend to many people and his colleagues but he is also a courageous and spectacularly generous human being before we begin i'd to emphasizethat this podcast is separatefrom my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desiron effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about scince and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's potcast our first sponsor is roca roca makes eyeglasses and sun glasses that are of the absolute highest quality the company was found aby two all american swimmers from stamford and everything about roca eyeglasses and sun glasses er design with performance in mind i've spent a lifetime working on the biology f the visual system and i can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly roca understands those challenges end the biology the visal system such that they have designe sun glasses and eye glasses that always allow you to see with crystal clarity now initially roca eye glasses and sunglasses were designe for sports performance and as a consequence all of their glasses are designed to be very light weight end to not slip off your face if you get sweaty however the designe of the glasses include some that are specifically for sport and others whose thesthetic really alows you to use them for sport as well as out to dinner or to work et cetera and that is how i use them if you would to try roca eye glasses nd sunglasses you can go to roca dot com that is aro k a dot com and enter the code hubermen to save twenty per cent off your first order again that is roca ar o a dot com and enter the code huberman at checkout to day's episode is also brought to us by levels levels is a programme that lets you see how different foods end behaviors affect your health by giving you real time fee back on your diet using a continuous glucosmonitor one of the most important factors impacting your immediate and long term health is the way that your body manages its blood glucos or sometimes refer to as blood sugar levels to maintain energy and focus throughout the day you want to keep your blood luco steady without big spikes or dips using levels you can monitor how different types of foods and different food comminations as well as food timing and things exercise combine to impact your blood glucos levels i strart using levels lilo ver a year ago and it give me a lot of insiht into how specific foods were spiking my blood sugar and then leaving me feeling tired for several hours afterwards as well as how the spacing of exercise and my meals was impacking my over all energy and in doing it really allowed me to optimize how i eat what i eat when i exercise and on such that my blood glucos's levels and energy levels are stable throughot the day if you are interested in learning more about levels and trying a continuous glucos monitor yourself go to levels dot link slash huberman right now levels is offering an additional two free months of membership again that is levels dot link elli and k slash huberman to get two fre months of membership we are always striving to make the huberman labpodcast better and to that end we need your help over the next month we are going to be carrying out a survey the purpose of the survey is to improve the hubermn labpodcast according to your feed back we put together a brief survey to understand what you love about the podcast hopefull you love a few things at least or may be just one thing as well as what you think could be improved or perhaps the many things that you think could be improved about the huberman lab podcast basically what we are asking is to get your feed back that we can improve any and all things about the huberman lab podcast the survey does not take long and every single response will be reviewed as a thank you for completing the survey we are offering two months free of the huberman la premium channel if you are already a member of the hubern

websight huberman lab dot com if you would be kind as to take a few minutes to fill out the survey and help us continue with bringing you the best possible content here at the hubern lab podcast and as always thank you for your interest in science and now for my discussion with doctor david linden professor linden welcome thanks much for haven me been looking for to our conversation and we have a lot to to about we do lots of different aspects of science lots of different aspects of personal gerney and what you are confronting now as it relates to your health in your future i want to start off with a question that i learned from the ont in only the great karl dyceroft who was the first guest on this podcast my calling at stamford and for those of you that do not recognize karl's name he is a am absolute fenam he is a a active clinical psypsychaatrist he is an emdy and y also is ama bio engineer who is developed a lot of the modern tools for probing the brain and am any time i've met with karl the first thing he says is what you must excited about lately that is a good question it is u i'm going to steal that approach and say what you must excited about lately well very very lately the most interesting thing that i read in ner science is the answer to a a a scientific problem that i think is really dear to a lot of people's hearts and that is what are the nerveemdings in the genitals that are responsible for sexual sensation and if you think about it right people can feel sexy from being touched on lots of different parts of the body but there is something special about the genitals does not matter male or female or intersects or gay or strait or by or whatever you are the genitals are are a hot spot and why and you would you would think as biologists we know this by now this would be something we could just answer but but it is been a mystery for a long time and if if you go back to to eighteen sixty there is a german neronatamus named krouse and he cut thin sections of tissue from the penus and the cliterisn he looked at them under the microscope and he saw a particular kind of nerve ending there that has since been called the crase corpuscle and there were lots of them in these two places and he thought well maybe this is the cellular basis of sexual sensation maybe these are the particular nerve endings that are responsible a for this am but there were somethings that that were in favor of that an some not these nerve endings are also in some other places that people confined more or less sexy thei're in the nippls and theire in the lips in thei're in the ainis all places that get popular in a in that domain but they are also in places the cornia or the lining of the joints distribution does not quite make sense and it was never known and if you wanted to really test as a scientist whether these nervendings are responsible you want to record their electrical signals while the genitals are being touched you would want to enactivate these cells and see if you could interfere with senette with sexual sensation and this in a preprient from david guintea's group at harvard is just what they have been able to do in mice they found away to label and record from and activate and inactivate artificially a the crause corpuscles and you see a nerve ending in the skin it could be conveying all kinds of information it could be tuned for hut or for cold or for itch or for pain or fuller in or for inflammation or for mechanical sensation stretching a vibration indentation and sure enough when they recorded from these crose corpuscles they really are a mechanical sensers as you would expect a if they were invol ved in sexual sensations o that was good an than ah the other thing then that they did as they they try to artificially turn them on and the way they did that as these genetic tricks to express one of carl dicerosts aha molecule that activates in herons when theyre when blue light is shown on them and they found that if they express a this artificial protne in the craucells in a in a male mouse and then shine blue light the mouse gets in erection are it far good what happens if you turn them off whele if you turn them off in a male mouse it is just as interested in females when theyare in heat but it will not mount and thrust and ejaculate as much and if you turn them off in a female mouse during the time of her cycle where she would normally be sexually receptive ah you find that she is much less interested she is much less likely to let him mount she is much less likely to let him finish this is the remarkable results thaft ah finally after all these years sense eighteen sixty now we know what the nerve endings are that convey sexual sensation and all good science then they are lot of questions that are really interesting to our everyday lives iu no people different things in bed and have different propensity for orgasm or or to be touched in different ways whele is part of that reason because of individual variation in theyr crouse corpuscle structure am we know that sexual sensation diminishes with aging is that in part because crause corpustle density is lost from the skin of the genitals and that is a reasonable idea because we know for example that fine touch censers in the finger tips a called murkell and misoner endtings also named after german anatamis many things are a are also loft with age that is a reasonable idea this finding from guinte's labs opened up a whole world of science and i've been my let my own lap does not work on touch but i've been a fan boy of touch for for many many years mostly because where i work at john's hopkins medical school there have been many terrific touch researchers it is been a world centre for it and i hereabout it over lunch and i got all fired up years ago i wrode a book about and i still follow the field and this is the most interesting thing in that field recently and as i recall ginti was your neighbor at hopkins before he moved to harvard that is right that is right he was one of the ones ginti a stephen show a michael caterina shinjohn don there've been a number of world leaders in in the sullular basis of touch sensation at hopkins do you recall if in the preprint that you were describing there was an experiment where they activated these crauscortpusles in females it is funny you should mention that i sent that exact emale to david ginty and they said they are in the process of doing that right now and they do not quite know yet and soy asked him i said for example is erection of the cliterus even a thing in mice he say well we are really not sure we are activating the crous cort puscles and female mice and we are just kind a staring at it and lookin and see if anything happens just there eaner does the you now dudu das tha th the body change shape is there a color change they do not even quite know what it is therre looking forkis is that much on the leading edge of things but i's a good question or perhaps the female mice would be more willing to mate outside of the usual time frame of receptivity if a these cross corpuscls are are stimulated that is possible my suggestion mot my guess would be not because i think that the hormono regulation of receptivity is a sledge hammer and very hard to overcome but they might be more willing to continumating or make for longer during there a fertile time and i dus one o remind people because we hat a a guest recently a doctorena molycue am whosa eurologist reproductive in sexual health expert is emdy and am a she made clear that the the cliterest and the penist come from the same embryonic origin they are analogous tissues am in a different individuals i do have one more question about this a sexual touch thing am these are periferal nerves right these are not of the brain and spinal cord they are in what we call the periphery and my understanding is that periferal nerons regenerate and can remodel themselves extensively in ways that a nerants within the brain and spinal court am tend to remodel less especially as one gets older out of the call critical period am is it possible that these cross corpuscyls and their patterns of inervation within the genitals change according to the stimulation that a people experience am in other words is sexual sensation experienced dependent that is a great question and we do not know because monitering this in people is not technically possible right it requires cadapher to show you can only do at once in animals it it it it will be possible and it it could be for a couple of different reasons and otherwords it could be i think what your imagining is that there is actual struc ctural plastucity if you looked athes crows corpuscles or a that you would actually see them changing their shape of their size or their or their density as a result of experience but a what can also happen is a phenomena desensitization a that is to say when their stimulation for a long time than a the recepters transiently can become less sensitive to touch and it is well known pera particularly in males that a that chronic masturbation can produce desensitization of secal sensation in the peanis and that could be a a result of a physical change a mortological change in the cros corpusctles a but it is more likely to be a change in their function that you would not be able to simply see by looking a out an outline of their structure in the microscope such an interesting topic thanks for opening things up with with that an ofll have to check out this preprint i'm also a huge fan of davi ginte's work and and coleagues therre many people involved in a that domain of work of course i'd to talk about your recent book and the sort of underlying basis of what led you to write it and what intreate you about this idea of human individuality the book unique iis one that will provide a link to in the shownote captions and am it is a very interesting idea that we are all different especially coming from a nurrow scientist to we were trained at least similarly to learn that sure the bumps and ripples of the brain an the fine wiring of the brain is different and we are all unique and different that we have different shapes a ca morphologies but focassing on human individuality is not something that modern nurrow science wor classic nouro science has really done much of it is really focased on how people do ex ther people do wy this way a tell us about unique and tell us about human individuality yah well i mean your absolutely rite when i look at the experiments n my own lab how do we do them well we work on mice do we work on mice with genetic variation no we work on highly in bred mice that are design to be as genetically similar to each other is possible and then we raise them basically in prison in little little sells which may not be a good idea and we try to give them as similar experience as possible they are giving toys an food an water but i greed it t resembles a a prison of sorts they are not free to rome that there they have nothing the experience of a wild mouse let me put it that way there and and yes there are as you said correctly there are plenty of experiments where there is enrichments a for mice and they love it for example in our lab when we put running wheels ind the cages ore mice and let them run overnight their active at night a your average mouse will run two calometers in a night for a little tiny mouse and some of the mice are intents there will run twenty calometers amagin a mouse doing twenty cabe but but it will happen they really really it they do not being in prison they they want to exercise and they really bord yes to get back to your general point a much of science is design to try to find general principls of of function of the brain of physiology of genetics ah and to ignore individual variation but individual variation is important to our human experience and actually is important to to the process of evolution and natural selection and how how species a make their way in the world that that it is it is something that that requires a lot of attention and to me what is really fascinating is that when you look at the variation in the way sense organs function it is almost a miracle that we can agree on a common reality at all even within the human species and this is true of of more of af a of some senses more than others obviously in your world in the retina we have various kinds of of loss of color vision a that are well known and some other more complicated a phenomena having to do with the empairments in the perception of motion a or form but a the place where this really happens is in the olfactory system we have approximately four hundred functional receptors for different odorant molecule smells a in our nose and if you a sequence the genoms of many people you find that the a that the the diona that encodes for these odorant receptors is unusually variable from individual to individuals matter of fact if you take two different people on average they will have functional differences in thirty per cent of their odor receptors and if you do as lesley vosau and her colleagues did at rochofeller university and give odor tests where they give people different things to smell and than they dilute them and find the threshold which they can detect them you find enormous changes from people people both in term in general terms some people are just better smellers than others but in terms of individual odours as well there is some odors that some people cannot detect and other people smell one way for example there is a athere is a secreted hormon called andrew stinon androstinon there are some people who cannot smell at all for some people a its smells rather pleasant cut grass and for some people it smells foul your owner sweat an it just depends on genetic variation in one particular odorant receptor abstrit interrupted a another a phenomenal researchur who studies oll faction among other things catherine duluck i once heard a say that some people have a gene that for them makes the smell of micro waye pop corn un they experience that smell as vamit and other people who lack this gene the smell of micrate popcorn or releast for them it is not aversive it can really be a binary response well it can actually that is a very particular funny case the the reletant cemical there is butericased and also iso vileric acid and a there are aresearchers i think rachel hurts a is one of them who have given a mixture of these two chemicals people if they say this is parmeson cheese they go o yo not t pirmishon cheese and if they give it to other people and say this is vamit they will go oh yet that is vames and if they tell people they give them one vile and say this is permerson cheesen th go yon and give another on he says vanine go yo and then they say will actuall we fool you was the same vile they say know you did not you must have made a mistake they are convinced that they could not have been the same thing this points out not only y is their genetic variation that ah is responsible forownd individuals perceive odor but we are incredibly suggestible in terms of odors and we we are very dependent upon them in terms of cultural context ah and and this can be this can be learned and and this is central to our humanity in the sense that that we humans are what i to call the antipandas ah pandos live in one spot ah in in southern china and they eat one thing bamboo and thats it humans are the opposite humans can live in any echological niche in the world from the tropics to the poles and humans ead a wide wide wide variety of foods and as result it means that we have to have a very plastical factory system that have to be very few things that we find innately aversive there are only a handful of odors rotding meat odors a molecules with the evocative names cadaverine amputrscene are things that even babies when theire new born find aversive but other things happen that they need to be learned for example am pretty much every adult finds poop odors ah unpleasant but babies happihappily play with their own poop they have to learn that is discusting it is not the the babies have a dfferent knows it is because they have to learn cultura inot innate it is not innate am there are only a few inate odor aversions and a few inate taste aversions that were we are born with and the other things are elaborated culturally and we can think about this in terms of how we we we we talk about odors for exam we might say vanilla smells sweet well that is wear that is thus ar two different senses how can something smell sweet tat's saying it sounds red isai it is a statement about cinesthesia right and but but how did it come to pass and to people say that vanilla smell sweet everywhere in the world whell dancers know in places in the world where vanilla is used with sugar ind in sweet foods desserts than people say that vanilla smell sweet or mint similarly a smell sweet if it is typically used together with sugar but if you go to a place a ave yet nom where mint is mostly used in savory dishes people will not say that mint smells sweet there is a parent association there that at least at our level of conscious understanding feeds back on to what we call al factor or smell perception but really it is a it must be a paret association at some point in development it is it absolutely as a paret association and it is something that goes on continually through your life right i mean lots of people for example i have stories of foods that they would not eat as a child but they came to as an adult a a good example of that is cloffee aa lot people have to overcome bitter aversion to a to become coffee officinatos a inthis this this feeds into the more the more general theme that there is no pure perception perception as inferance it is not there is a purely objective world that can somehow make its way through the senses and we can perceive that as the truth all of our perception through all of our senses both the outward pointing seunses of the world smell and taste and sight and hearing i am the inward pointing sounses balance and i is my stomach full i am things that all of them are based on experience and expectation an the situation of the moment as many of i've been taking ag one daily since two thousand twelve some delighted that their sponsering the pod cast ag one is a vitemen mineral probiotic drink that is designed to me all of your foundational nutrition needs of course i try to get enough servings of vitemens and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day but oftentimes i simply cannot get enough servings but with ag one i'm sure to get enough vitemens and minerals and the probiotics that i need end it also con tains adaptagens to help buffer stress simply put i always feel better when i take a g one i have more focus and energy and i sleep better and it also happens to taste gright for all these reasons whenever i'm asked if you could take just one supplement what would it be i answer ag one if you would to try ag one they will to drink ag one do com slash hubermen to claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs pluss a year supply of vitemen d three k to again that is drink a g one dot com slash hubermen are there any examples of uniqueness of visual perception that come to mind i recently did a social medio post that involved it was essentially three rings a ablue ring a red ring and a blue ring in the centere perhaps it was the other way round excuse me it was red blue red and i asked which ring is in front or they all at the in the same plain now of course it is a two dimentional image i and interestingly it splits out into about thirds some people see the blue ring in front quite a bit others see a red ring out in front others see them all in the same plane and this a we think has to do with a difference is in two things between individuals one is the distribution of the cone photoros eptors which we know is essentially random between individuals maybe ven between the two eyes and then a and that gives rise to this phenomena of chromatic abirration am which is the displacement of the visual image according to the wavelength of the light and we will not get into the physics of it now i'll soon do a post that oafully distills it in a manner that simple enough that people understand but clearly some people see certain colors in front of others a and the person wrigt next to them could see the opposite color in front and others say what you talking about all the colors are exactly the same plane of of vision a that is the one that i know i'm guessing some others and a perhaps some more robust ones well i think perhaps thiss may be not what you have in mind but one way in which experience modifies thehe visual world has to do with how much light your exposed to in the first five years or of your life and kids that do not get outside are much more likely to be myopic and it actually is rear nogted near sighted yes ah when they grow up athen kids who got outside and we now know that at least part of the story is that light seems to stimulate the ah expression of a class of molcules called trophic factors that you are well acquainted with that actually change the shape of the eyeball it is not really the structure of the retina or the lems of the corny of the actual degree of elongation of the eyeball changes changing the way the the retina sets relative to the lens and that seems to be light dependent early in life and a which gives rise to a a to a a hir insance on myopia and and to me this is really while first of all ets it is its news you can use you should get your kids outside fabsont all kinds of reason eseate outside to especially in the morning yet that circatian realin i i know that the famous hubermanesga a point there you havebe putting me in the grave david and imaybe telling people to or ito maybe'll be on my tombstone they get get sunlight in your eyes egon ats pecially on me especially on cloudy days cause there is still sunlight en if you cannot see the physical object of the sun on cloudy days well youi think this whole idea of having traits that are dependent upon early life experience is fascinating because there are a number of situations where you would guess that something is genetic but it is not its actually dependent on early life experience and there is a there is an amazing story about this having to do with the early days of world work too in the early days of world wore too the japanese army just swept through asia they defeated the the british and malasia and singapore they over and tiland and berman they were knocking on the gates of india and everything was going great except the japanese army had a problem there werean enormous number of their soldiers who became incapacitated with heat stroke they got their cour temperature got too hot and a when the army doctors examine them they found this was much more likely to happen in soldiers a who came from the northern part of japan hocido where it sa where it snows in the winter as opposed to the southern part of japan micushue which is a semitropical environment and the classical explanation the biologe of us would guess would say oh all rightwell this is happened genetically over many years a you have a family that is been in kushue from many generations and you have selected forgene variance to lowou to tolerate the heat better and we know actually what this is if you are more heat tolerant it is because you have more of a particular class of sweat glan called the ecrine sweat glande the sort of salt water sweat glands not the lipity stinky armpilt sweat glands called the apricran ones the ecrine one you have a higher fraction of them that are inervated meaning that the signals from your brain that say your corse too hot can then make you sweat the total density of sweat glands between northern and southern soldiers in japan was not different but the southern soldiers tent to have a higher degree of innervation ar i says at o cable to happen genetically over many generations but if you look at those rare cases where you have soldiers from a long established northern family and their parents moved south and then tthey grew up in the southern location they had high sweat gland innervation they were well heat tolerant conversely if you had a well established southern cushoe family and they move to hocaido and then have their child that child developed the northern sweat gland innervation patern meany less nerve innervation of those sweat glands as you mentioned before just as many sweat glands just less nerve innervation therefore thee sweat glands could not be accuvated they condum het as well their heat tolerance was lower iresactly right and and what is what is what is wonderful is that this gives an advantage that you cannot get through evolution and that it can happen right away in the in one generation right evolutionary changes slow right and you can adapt as a species and as a family over over many many many generations but when you have a phenomenon that is set by a early life experience well then you can benefit from that early life experience within your own life it is not that your great great great great great grandchildren will ultimately benefit you benefit another wonderful example of this a comes from field mice vols and we were talking earlier about how we both worked with tha the scientist ervzooker ats a at berkley who is a a specialist in a in in invols and a what people found is that if you take a wild caught a field mice and a you have a a pregnant mothers and you have them in the lab but you manipulate the lights that a you have artificial spring and other words day length is getting longer day after day during the pregnancy then what happens is when their pups were are born they will have a low density of fur anticipating summer temperatures a if you however a put them in artificial fall where day length is getting shorter ah they will be born now with high density of for anticipating winter temperatures and of course you can do this no matter what the season actually is in the world by manipulating these lights in the lab and the sweating japanese soldiers this is a great example of early life plasticity and just the sort of trait that if you askd somewhe they would probably guess is heritable but actually is not thanks yor mentioning ervzucher who is a yosumension to is an advise r to us both whos done incredible work in circating biology seasonal rhythms foremones in behaviour i have such reverence for ervand the experiment you mention a maybe smile wide because it is a but one of gosh maybe hundreds of incredible studyes of people are interested in seasonal rhythms and circatiang rhythms and biology of the most interesting kind definly check out ervings ockers work at a berkeley will i'll provide a link to to his apubmet a there since we have been taking at tour of individual variation in ofactory perception visual perception and a now heat tolerance a i have to ask are you aware of any examples off the top of your head am in the auditory domain that am particularly intrigue you yo well i would say one really interesting example hows to do with perfect pitch perfect pitch as a trait that is to say a you have the ability a to to hear a note played and say oh that is a sea sharp right this is a pretty rare trait even if you look among highly trained musicians if you went to peabody conservatory of my university john's hopkins and tested people there you would find a higher incidence of perfect pitch than you would in the general population but still maybe one in tem traine musicians have perfect pitch and parenthetically having perfect pitch does not necessarily make you a better musician abut it is an interesting phenoman and the question is well is perfect pitch heritable and the answer is when you look at twin studies where which is what we use to estimate eritability the answer is it is kind o low it there is a heritable component but it accounts for my recollection is on the on the order of thirty forty per cent of the veryability in perfect pitch however if people receive oure t ranning starting at a young age the chance that they will develop perfect pitch can improve drastically in your book unique a you cover aspects of human individuality that extend beyond the percept cindoman an into the cognitive domin well ya absolutely and a i think i think it is good to set the stage here if we are going to be talking about heritability and human individuality and and if i can go off on a little bit of a riff a for the benefit of your of your listeners in virs here if you look at human traits whether their behavoral traits shyness or very straightforward morphological traits height ah what you tend to find is that there are very few traits that are entirely heritable where all their veriability can be predicted based on the gene variance you get from your mother and father and there are a few traits that are absolutely unheritable but that most fall in between let me give an example every one in the world has either wet or dry your weps and it turns out that this is determined by variation in the single gene the name of the genus boring its a b c c eleven ah it is a i on transporter and a there is a variation in this gen gives rise to either wet or dry our wax it does not matter how your parents raise dou does not matter what foods you ait growing up oesn't matter what what a diseases your mother had when you ware in the womb it is one hundred per cent heritable well does this mean that a b c c eleven we should call it the er wax type gene well no because it is not there just for that this this gene is expressed in cells an all parts of the body doing all kinds of things our waxes just something that we notice genes do not code for traits they cod for protines and we have to be careful about how we refer to them in that way a for example the wet er wax ge a variant of the a b c c eleven gene also confers a slightly higher risk for breast cancer ah clearly it is not just for our wax it is is for bunch of things most of which we do not yet no dout but in the case of eur wax this trate is one hundred per cent heritable at the other end of the scale speech accent is zero per cent heritable it is entirely dependent upon the speech that you experience ah in your childhood and interestingly it is the speech of your peers more than the speech of your family which is why the children of emigrants sound the place where they wound up not their parents ah and there is no evidence for any degree of heritability now just to be clear i'm talking about speech accent whether you have a high or low voice or its nasal or more or less resinent these are physical things having to do with the vocal tract and they are in part heritable o k we have got one thing that is a hundred percent heritable wonthing of zero per cent heritable but where do most things falgt most things fall in the middle ah ah one of the most heritable traits that we know about in humans is height and in the united states height is about eighty five per cent heritable eighty five per cent of the variation the trade of height can be explained ah by what you inherit from your mother and your father well what is the rest well it is nutritian it is the diseases you fought off it is also random variation which will talk about a lot later ah now you might say o k well that is an estimate for people in the us is this tru all over the world will know if you go to a place where people routinely do not get enough nutrition and are routinely fighting off infectious diseases this is been studied in rual bolivia for example or rural india now height is no longer eighty five per cent heritable it is only fifty per cent heritable why because people in these situations where they do not get enough nourishment ere their fighting off these diseases cannot live up to their genetic potential for height if you want to make things better for the people of the world then every one needs to have basic things the ability to learn an enough nutrician and and decent medical care and schools in order to fulfill their genetic potential for positive traits and a height i've uses an example because it is very uncontroversial but we could apply the very same analysis to intelligence general intelligence now their people argue about do things icutests really measure anything real and there has been a lot of fighting in te scientific literature about this but i think intelligenc tests are not perfect and they are sometimes culture bound but they are actually quite predictive of of of of later success and a much more then say essay tetests or garetests or em cats or other standard i ses there is only those correlate in some way they do by do but but but the icutests are better actually there is a by this they the classic icutest i am talking about the modern variancs of the classic i cutests that are administered by trained psychologists ah and are't just a paper form and they'are not perfect and no test will be perfect but they are pretty good and then if you aske the questionable what is the heritability for icutest score ah well the answer tends to be different depending upon the population if you look again in in countries the u s er in western europe that are fairly affluent where where people a tend to have good access to to nutrition and medical care and schooling and kids get to play on theyre not and they are not tromatized by war then ah then i cutescore is heritable in the ball park of sixty seventy per cent but if you look at people who do not have those benefets who are poor and this can being the united states as well if you look at a communitys that that a face discrimination and have consistently poor poor health care in schools then i cue is less heritable why for the very same reason that it is on height because people cannot live up to theyare junetic potential when they do not have the basic things that everybody needs presumably if to identical twins and i realize they are it identical but youre familiar with twins you have twin children on if to identical twins are raised separately a the correlation in their icu it can only is it that only sixty i think you said about sixty six percent of their icue and be predicted on the basis of their genatic make up alone i mean it makes perfect sense to me as to y if one of those twins went to schools that were demanding of a lot of different topic matter and the other one went to schools wear the instruction level was really deficient that one would perform far less well on an icutests unless of course the icutest is in tapping into schoolbase knowledge its tapping into some other a thermometer of of called intelligence or icu well the thing is that good schools quarrelly with many other things right the students that go to good schools are not just benefiting from good schools they tend to also have good medical care and safor less dromatizing neighbourhoods and their more likely to have books parents with books in the home and a and and a whole number of things that are all beneficial when you try to do epidemeology on this you have to beware that things are very deeply interconnected but but you bring up a good point it turns out that the way we get these estimates of heridability there is two ways one way is to compare called identical or monosigotic twins with called fraternal or disygotic twins the identical twins will share nearly a hundred per cents of ther gene veriance and on average fraternal twins share fifty per cents of ther a of their gene veriancs and generally speaking when people do these studies in order to avoid confounds of sects they will compare same sects fraternal twins o boys to boys and girls to girls ah a and a when you put these incidents into a formula call fishers equation then you can come up with an estimate of the heriability of the trait but there is an assumption present in that and it is called the equal environment assumption youre saying well two kids raised in the same family have the same environments well that is not always true rights that can be violated by a number of a of different situation it turns out that a more powerful but much more difficult way to estimate heritability is by looking at twins reared part either identical twins or fraternal twins your topart and there was a landmarked study called the minesota study of twins reared part which is abbreviated mistra that is really the gold standard for asessing the heritability of many different human traits both behavioral traits a but also disease incidents but of course it is a small end because tepopulation of identical twins reared apart that you can get into the lab is not is not that large they had something i doftremember the exact numbers but they had something eighty sum a aidenticals in fifty sum fraternals in there in their sample but by doing this they were able to come up with a lot of interesting estimates and for example most a personality traits a what the psychologists a use the acrenym ocean to mean openness conscientiousness and pa the agreeabldness and naraticism i think i got that right feldri a that these traits on average tend to be about fifty per cent heritable and o case say right well fifty per cent of those personality traices heritable the rest is got o be how you were raised it is got be in your family and everyone was shocked when they actually did the analysis om and found that family has almost nothing to do with it a an what what are yo are you getting it is it' it is it is it is got to and i think the important thing to realizes these traits i just listed iu we call these personality traits but they are not the sum total of the way you are in the world parents can inculcate many things in their children they condemonstrate trades people are much more likely to go into an occupation if their parents did they can inculcate moral ideas and religious ideas but in terms of these ocean personality traits they have astonishingly little to do with it then this brings up the question well if fifty per cent of the variation in these personality traits is not from your genetics and it is not from your family where does it come from and the answer seems to be is that it comes from the random nature of the development of the body and the nervous system and this is this is a point that i think many people do not understand this is something but biologists know but we have done a very poor job of communicating to the general public the geno all your dianae all three billion basis of dianae all nineteen thousand or genes in human do not make a blue print for making your body and brain there it is not al scematic diagram that connects everything to everything partically in the nervous system where we have these undreds of turlians of connections rather it is a rather vague recipe that the genome does not say oh o ke you glutimate using nuron and the brainres on call the phalamus grow for two hundred microns towards the top and then and then and then cross the midline and then grow towards the ear for another distance no t it says someting hey you bunch a gludimate nurons in the thalamus over here in this area about half of you cross the midline and what does this mean in terms of individual variation l means well for sfr for some individuals forty per cent of their axons will cross the midline of the brain and for another individual sixty per cent will even in identical twins and as you correctly said a moment a go identical twins are not really identical either in their bodies or their temperament if you take newborn identical twins and you give them a s t scan just to measure the shape of their organs they are not the same you might have one twin whose splean is thirty per cent larger than the than the other twins or whose liver is thirty per cent smaller then the other twins even though they have the exact same diana and there were line right next to each other in the womb and presumably have the same or very similer feedal environment and the reason is the random or as we say stocastic nature of norl development a great way to study this is with nine banded armadillos i know wher can weird here but i love they on mardilla because i've been told tell me i do not want to a a interrupted too long but an a's far as ie know the only animal in north america that carri's leprosy a that is that is true and youn and there selada twinning going on in armadella is right well what there is as actually quadding armmadillos or the nine baundat armadillo in particular andthey are different armadillos a'm not really an armadillo specialists i do not know if this wholes are all of them but the nine baunded armadilla is born as identical quadruplets alsom bassom you can take these identical quadroup that newly born armadilla i donof wy think you call them pups i do not know what a baby armadilla was called i'm sure there is some particular word for it and some one will tell us as sury sonlon win the comminents on you to what is the name of a baby armdil i know thike a ferret baby fairits a kits a the mums ar jills the dads or bobs i use to be obsessed with this kind of naming at youit is a it is a business of ferrets or a what is a gang of racoons or whatever it if you can tell us what the name is for the baby armadillas as well as what he call a group of armadillas an you win the pride associated with being right outed tright right one of my favourites is an u an ostentation of peacocks amazing or a murder of crows who comes up with this yi know it is it is a raft of otters ii think that is correct if you have four new born a identical nine baund at armadillos then this is a great model system that biologists can use to study a a a stocastic differences and developmont and and sure enough their brains are wired slightly differently their bodies are slightly different if you test them behaviorly even very very early in life they have different propensities some are boulderwill explore more summer wolf tend to hide in the corner more and you do not we know this from the lab a if you get a box of mice that are in bread from the breeder and you pluck them out and they are not behaviorly identical some might try to bite your hand some will run away some will stand stock still where does this behavioural variation come from in mice that are nearly gernetically iden to call well it comes from bunch of things they do not always have exactly equal experience but mostly it comes from the pseudo randum stocastic nature of telm i to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker inside trackers a personalized nutritian platform that analyzes data from your blood endi ane to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health goals i'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your mediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test however with a lot of blood tusts out there you get information back about blood lippits about hormones and on but you do not knowhat to do with that information with inside tracker they have a personalized platform that makes it very easy to understand your data that is to understand what those lipids with those hormon levels at cetera mean and behavioural supplement nutrictian and other protocals to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges that aur ideal for your imediate and long term health inside trackers ultimate plan now includes measures of both apo b and of insolent which are key indicators of cartyofvascular health and energy regulation if you to track insade tracker you can visit inside tracr dot cam slash hubermen to get twenty per cent off any of inside trackers plans again that is inside tracker dot cam slash hubermen to get twenty per cent off and is the pseudo randum stocastic nature of development one of the maging major excuse me driving forces for evolution because we heare about mutations and we always think people tend to think rather that mutations are bad but of course mutations provide the variation that can also subserve adaptive traits an if your offan of the exmen as i am huge fan of the exmen the entire series every single one including the woverein movies you quickly come to learn that cenetic mutation is at the heart of variation which is at the heart of individuality which is what we are talking about right and genetic variation is ot the heart of ntrutality but there is also the re also these other things right that we have talked about there is the effects of early life experience and there is the stocastic nature develope because if you through the randomness of development happened to have a particularly great liver you are not in a pass that on to your children rigt that isnce in your germ line you will not pass that trait along just a brief insert here on germ line a we had o ded rachafi on the pod cast you studies an epigenetic transmission in am and an inheritance a of it is not lamarkyan we have to point thit out but a inheritanceiv of a sort of accuired trait sa does happen it a the erm line s the genes at at present in the the sperm and in the eggs all the other a cells of your body have genes of course but a the best way put this is a simply going to the gim an getting fit am does not make your children more fit because the germ line as far as we know is not modified in a direct way a in other words the deone within sperm and eggs are not modified according to your behaviours in most but not all cases that is right and and as you are as you correctly said about oded's work and an other people's work there is what is called trans generational epigenetic inheritance which means that you can have traits that are past not from one generation to the next but even two generations to the grand children that do not require modification of deone but to date that has been shown very convincingly in in a worms and in plants a the evidence in mammels is is really not there yet in in my opinion and most of the claims for that and it is very popular thing to say i epigenetically inherited my grandmothers are great grandmother's drama a the evidence at presents is is poor actually a lot of it comes from epidemiology most of which came from famines in the ethercolics region of northern sweden and that very good medical records than they said oh well if your grandfather went through the famine than you are more likely to have this trait of your mail or if your grandmother went through this than if youare if your mail have this tren your fem out of that trait and i mean their two problems one is that there is not a biological mechanism but the other problem is that the way these things were discovered is by something called harking or hypothesizing after the rev results are known a they did very many statistical comparisons to try to find something significant and from your work in the lad that when you do many comparisons you were going to get some things that lookd significants just occasionally random way through through through luck and you have to apply a statistical correction called a bonferoni correction when you make many particularly posthuck comparisons after the experiment a comparisons to set the bar much higher for accepting that data and most of those studies they did not apply that correction and i remain unconvinced of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in mamals now let us be clear just because it has not been shown convincingly now t does not mean that it will not be ther are some good people working very hard on this and they may well a describe a mechanism and show this convincingly in the years to come but right now a you may well inherit your grandmas or great grandma's trama but youare probably doing it socially not through marks on your deonay that change is how your genes are expressed or not expressed as i subscribe to the idea that there is absolutely certainly transgenerational inherentacs of parenting an upbringing right i mein your grandparents araise your parents you raise you not always people can be adopted in fact iave tha hunted members of my family am but bi understand what you are saying correctly the evidence that for instance sum stress related gene was modified during a trama in my grandparents are great grandparents and the idea that that has passed to me through my parents that the evidence thereis is far weaker right an whn youwhn you think about it well how dod that happen that have to get into your your grandparents permer excel and then produce that effect in the brain of your parents and then it have to get into their sperman or excel and then contribute of producing in yeu but dam but fragmentation of diana an sperm is a orinagis is a is a common a thing especially as people age diana spermanegs fragment am and it is possible that some of those mutations still lau for viable embrios it is in theory thet germaline could be changed by a environmental events well right up but now i think you are starting to talk about things that are heritable rig you are not talking about markson diana your tongne about the structure of the diona itself am that is its own separate issue now i think i wont to be really careful about this because what is now i think fairly well established is that you can transfer things epigenetically over a single generation a if as result of experiences that the mother has during pregnancy a for example we know that during the nineteen eighteen pandemic fle a many women were pregnant and got the flue and if you look at their children you find interesting statistical anomalies and those children for example the males wound up going to the army for world work two nd of course the army does a complete physical and the records are very goods you can go into that day to base and you find that a the male children a that were a in utero during the winter of nineteen eighteen during the pandemic fle are on average a millameter or two shorter you mayt sa no meter to that is nothing but in a huge tcitical sample of millions of people that is enormously significant more interesting is that the incidencscisophrenia went up about four fol from about one per cent to about four per cent and even though autism was not a term in nineteen eighteen yet h i do not think came along later what we now retrospectively would call autism also went up by about fourfold there is something about mom being stressed and carryin the feetus at a particular stage that seems to impact brain development in a way that then makes that child more likely to be scisophrentic or artistic when they grow up do we know that its tress and at my recollection of this ileave this to is a the late pollsternburg's work is well i maybe have that name a increct but in an event that it is a if pregnant mom gets the fle in the first trymester you see this higher incidents of schisaphrenia an artistic offspring am and but do we know that it stress perce because strestsful to have the flue but the flues a bunch of other things co be fever could be a a some break down in the immune barrier i just wone to open up the the number variables that this could be or do we know that it something in the hypothlemic petuitery called stress axis that is a adrenals amtyprothlamic peturitery drenal acis a tha gis it elevated courtes all a or could it literally be an immunural interaxtion of some other sort it is probably the last thing you mention in a muneral interaction and the reason i say that is that a gloria choy ata am i te a together with her collaborators has made a mouse model of this phenomena she takes pregnant female mice and she injactson with something that that its she does not actually infect them with virus she puts a chemical in that is on the cote of viruses that mimics viral infection and a then what happens is that in a way that interestingly is an interaction with the with the bactural content of her of her got produces a surge of a immune signaling molecule called interlucan seventeen interlucan seventeen can pass through the plucanta into the pedus and if it is present just as you said at a particular point of development does not work anywhere during pregnancy but during something that is sort of the mouse equivalent of the first trimester if that occurs it causes disordered development of the layers of the quartex instead of it looking layers of a cake you see balls and clumps of cells and parenthetically in some but not all postmortem tissue from artistic people you can also se those balls and clumps cells those embalsin clumsif sells thought to reflect a alterations in sell migration they are yes som some i do not know if it is entirely known how much of it is sell vision or migration but certainly migration is a part of it and it is very likely that critical momens a to diserupt this ordering of the brain and produce these increases in skitzophrenia or or a latism vulnerability a are coming at a point where nurons are migrating a during development and a what choice group dids they did all the things youwant to do as a biologist they gave things to block the function of of this interlucan signaling molecuall and it blocked the phenolenon they artificially injected the signaling molecule into feedal brain when the mom had not been stressed and they they could reproduce it i'm not saying that there are not effects of stress hormones from the hypothalnc petuitary axis that are important that you mentiond but in this mouse model system work a it seems that a you can produce it through this immune signaling pathway and and then the question is well are these mice autistic well ow do if a mouse is oughtistic and and the answer is it is actually a little vague right there are behaviors that nuro sciencists say are analogous of human atism and one of them is if you give a mouse a marble in its home cage it will bury it over and over again compulsively or bury many marbles and people say that that is somehow analogous to some of the compulsive behaviors you see an aughtism it is a bit of a stretch right an insa challenge to interpret mouse behavior in in human terms but am it is a reasonable for step incredible and a i hope more wil continue to be done a as it surrounds the a first triaster influenza hypothesis cause it t's been around a while and am an obviously there is a spectrum a of what we call autism massburgers and a nowadays people refer to it is sometimes is nauroa typical there is some high functioning people with autism there is som low functioning people with autism and a for that matter thres some high functioning low functioning people who do not have autism am but it is something that i think a demands our attention and and that hopefully will be resolved at some point because also influencas a but one immune a insult am and presumably pregnent women are being bombarded with all sorts of a virisism bacteriand fungale infections and fighting them off wer not fighting them off and who knows what the variation in a ner immune interactions exist in there they give rise to good variation and let us call it am a debilitating variation well that is that is absolutely right and for one example is that a we do not know what the effects r ah the children who were in utera while there mothers were fighting off covet right we will not know for for a while or the hamincol and there might i mean there might be nothing ta or there might be something serious ah lurking there there was for pandemic fle i will be very interesting an and importanc to find out agreed i'd love to talk with you about mind body but before we do that i would be totally rem us if i did not ask for you or broad top contour understanding of the many brain the sara bellum i the called miny brain and here is why i've been a practising near a scientist for youn close to three decades i know where the sara belum is i've dissectes a bunch of them i a i coand tell you where a few things are in there and i certainly have read about what the sara belum does but whenever i do a pubmed search on sara bellum i see an ever expanding said of things that the sarabelum is implicated and not just balance this must be wher but also timing also cognition i hear about timing in particular of motor behavior but then i also here that is involved in learning and not just motor learning and it certainly is involved in motor learning perhaps that little miny brain is ut doing fifty or a thousand different things but how should we think about the sara bellum what is it doing and what are some of its cor operations that in form both what it is doing and perhaps what other airs of the brain are doing is well because i can point to the ratinas or to auditory quartax or the thalumus and yes there is some mysterious nuwcly eying the brain but to me the sara belum is one of the most cryptic and a complicated structures to understanding i know you spend some time in there what is the sara belum do well a sara bellar researtures to joke that the sarabellum as a counterweight to keep your head from falling forward o perfect whet uht all the texting nowadays people need bet bigger sara bat's right that is rght probably over many generations and that i'll at it along with a expansion of the thums ah ah but of course everybodyis goin a taxt with their minds and about another ten years right you will now belongs in plonce am you will not need your thumbs alall oor may be just five or my friend edichang is a nerou surgeon and a works on the auditory system i hase bee on the spodcast before you wave saying that i in therian actually in practice you could just record the nerral output to the muscles of the speech system essentually and you could just implify that and you could text without acually speaking a in fact when we read he told me a we are actually receiving the signals as if we were going to speak the words were reading but they do not quite arrive at the place where you could get a full blown posynaptic potentials ye are not actually moving the vocal machinery a that means the motor signals are getting sent out there and youre speaking what you are reading but you just do not know it that is wrin ins very analogous to what happens during the remfas of sleep when you have commands your brain is issuing commands to your muscles to to do things behave in your dreams to to run away or go here or go there a but those signals actually are blocked in the brainstem prevent it from from rich in your muscles because the a nerves that do not go through your brainstem the ones that control your eye movements are not subject of that blockead that is why you can produce the rapid i movements in in ariamsleep but yow this is a general theme and the brain a lot of times you have the output but then you shut it down and there are remsleep behavior disorders where people thrash and move in their sleep a durink durink rem and it is because this outflow that is normally blocked is not is not blocked have you never had the reverse happen i have where you wake up and your still in called rem atonia you are still paralyzed and there is that split second that feels eternity where you are wide awake and you cannot move and i'll tell you it is terrifying ya sleep paralysis and actually it is been known aforever you can actually find ancient greek depictions of people lying with a demon on their chest paralyzing them and that is acually from sleep paralysis later hogarth a did a drawing aof exactly that a yes is a well known phenomenon but to get back to the sarabellum a as we started am the sarabellum is as you said definitely involved in motor co ordination people who have damaged to the sarabellum are not paralyze but they tend to be clumsy a they tend to not co ordinate their movements they have a disturbed gait if their reaching for an object they often over shoot it and have to make successive approximating motions to get back a to their target that is well understood but if you look through evolution the sarabellum is connected to this brain region called the phalumus and its connected from there to many reads including the frontal quartex where phenomena a planning and a decision making and a moral sense and many aspects of personality seem to be uncoded then the question becomes able that is very far away from being clumsy what are these connections doing and as time has gone on i've been in this business from over forty years now on an old guy and initially we seit oh ye sarabellum movement control motor co ordination that is what it is for as time goes on as you correctly said the sarabellum has been implicated in more and more functions many of which are far removed from the motor system and if we are looking for a theme about what the sarabellum does is that it is there to predict the immediate future it is trying to determine what is going to happen in the next second wor to to best god behaviour and as you can imagine this kind of general computation could be applied very well you can see whites important for in a motor systems and doing sports you knw if you are trying to hit a baseball looking what the picture is doing and trying to antispate what the pitch is but it also comes up in a social realm if we are trying to read someone in predict what they are going to do as this person friend or foe which is one of the first things that we try to assss when meeting some one are they competent which is the second thing we try to assest ah when meeting something a lot of this depends upon predicative circuitry and a it depends in part on the sarabellum and it seems to be at least partially impaired in people who sustain sara bellar damage it seems as if interestingly the sarabellum started out for prediction related for motor control and through evolution it is basic computation has been applied to other nonmotor behaviours now i'm speaking in generalities and a lot of the details of this remain to be worked out and understood but i would say that is in a notshell the modern conception of the sarabellum thank you finally somebody explains to me at a top contour but highly informed way what the sarabelun does i could not be more grateful my pleasure in all aspects of biology an life the term nature verses nurture is relevant but never much as when thinking about the nervous system and i know this first and because i've study neral development both the nature side the call hard wired stuff that genes just set up nerons wire up to that nerro et cetera the carabelms in the back the eyes are in the fron the hard wired stuff aand then the soft wired stuff the nurture stuff if the stuff that can be modified by experience what your thoughts on nature verses nurture and should there even be a verses in there yet i do not think there should and and i have a lot of problems with nature verses nurture as a as an expression it was populized by frances galton i in no nineteenth century aa colleague of a of a of darwins and i think it is wrong in were misleading in a lot of ways of course the nature in nature verses nurture is meants in this case to me inheritability right what you inherit in the gen variations from your mother and father and nurture means how your parents or your community raised you ah the problem i have with nurture is that it is too narrow a term that really it should be replaced with the word experience and experience in the broadest possible sense not just social experience but ah the foods your mother ah when she was carrying you in utero ah the diseases you fought off or your mother fought off while she was carrying you ah in eutro the bacterial population of your guts a experience meaning anything that impinces on you starting from the earliest stages feedal development a continuing to the last day of your life i think it should be very expansive much much more than social experience in the family or the or the community and as you mention i have a problem with verses because there is this idea that these things are are essentially in opposition well is he that way because of of of his gene veriancer is that way because of what what happened to him and i think the thing to realize is that a experience and heredity interact in all kinds of interesting ways some of which are oppositional and some of which are reenforcing a classic one from genetics has to do with the getic dases called fenal citeneria or pqe u a which is a an inability to a to metabolize a the dietary ameno acid fannil alenene and a a in order to have this you have to inherit broken copies of this gene from both your mother and your father it is a called recessive trait and here is where the experience comes in it only matters if you eat foods rich and fannil alenane if you do not it does not matter that you inherited these things right that is a way which genes an experience interact an idea of in wit ways in which then they interact positively am think about athletic ability right a lot of athletic ability is has a heritable component if you are born fast for example a than you are more likely to do sports and practice them and get better exports is a result of your experience o here j gen's and experience are feeding back on each other in a positive feet backloupso there really is not a a verse a verses at all and that of course the last thing is that this is not the entirety we talked earlier about the pseudo random nature of development stocastic development and if i were to take the phrase nature verses nurture and reconfigureate i would change it to read heridability interacting with experience filtered through the random nature of development now that does not fall off the tongue as elegantly as nature verses nurture in nature verses nurtures if the goves the gloves do not fit you must quit hat's got that com snappy snaredrum beat but i think it is it is a more accurate heridability interacting with experience filtered through the ramdomness of development yeu we can shorten that up and a and we will just call it am a the linden hypothesis i do not think i can take credit for that o it belongs to other people sure but but there is a long history in science of of things being ap shortened up and a coined and that is a as important and i'm not hit would not turn to rob attribution here am a and the good news is perhaps you cannot call it the linen hypothesis but i can y and what i found is as with the galopan equation which is now out there as a a hydration it is a formula a formula that a gives broad but am research in form perameters as to how much water one should drink in order to maintain proper hydration for physiologist doctor anto gallopan who is a pn a physiology and and n expert in all aspects of exercise cience there is the galloping equation there is the sop ord principle i'm naming these things left in right a were appropriate and am i'm naming these things a sparingly and were appropriate am from here on out heritability interacting with experience filtered through the ramdomness of development as the linden hypothesis and i'll be demned if anyone's gan a rename it a am faster that i'm going to propagate it s well i think all the the the genot will benashiing their teeth about this being named after some one who is not actually a genotisis quite all right and their dentists will thank me let us talk about mine body oq i am fascinated by this a for a couple of reasons and i promised to keep this brief but when i was growing up i was very interested in animals and biology an my fathers a scientist and i got very interested in neuro science early a as people perhaps no and much of nerow science as i was coming up through the midnineties two thousands two thousand ten to twenty stretch which focased on the brain piece very little on the body there was nothing about got brain access in the early discussions and course work am in parallels all of that i've been interested in mental health physical health and it is just call it performance and aum got interested in meditation respiration base practise is things eogenedra things that by way of experience i understood immediately had a profound influence on the nervous system states of mind and body nowadays there is an entire instituted the national institutes of health for complementary health and medicine essentially exploring things yogenedra respiration practices even supplements and things of that sort and there is thisunderstanding that oh my goodness the nervous system extends into the body and the body sends neurl signals back into the brain and this whole notion of mine body has fort tiunately migrated away from kind of am california counter culture ecellent institute only a an hippy new age magic carpet stoff by the way that is not but i believe that is but that is often how it was looked at in the past and now people at every level science and medicine at every major university and in every scientific journal are strying to publish papers about the interactions between bodily organs the breathing apparati the diframe longs the hard heartrate veriability we hearabout an the liver the got brain access in particular and mind body the idea that our thoughts could influence our body and that are bodily state could influence our thoughts is fortunately not just understood but it seems to be both accepted and appreciated whatever your thoughts on mind body what does that mean to you and what do you think is the potential of the mind body interaction it seems to me we have just barely scratched the surface yah well i am glad you asks i think it is it is a really fascinating ah situation and ah were things are changing very very quickly and i think to me the most important thing for people to understand is that when you have a hypothesis let us sall you have a hypothesis that ah meditation can a a tenuate chronic pain well there is a temptation to think that this operates outside the realm of science and biology that is in some ery fairy realmam clouds that this happens and an an i mean for for good reason there are a lot of people who will describe it in exactly that way with oras or they they co op scientific terms resonance and energy but they do not actually use them in scientific way you kow there is a lot of very fuzzy language that surrounds this but it should not obscure the fact that when you have a hypothesis that say some mental state meditation or or orguided breathing a a effects some process in the body that you should be trying to understand this in terms of a biological hypothesis not in terms of some some some in distinct realm that that is that is different manifestation y and i know i really learned this initially from my father my father was a psychitrist and fact kind of a talking cure old fashioned psychoanalists without is practis ila loss angelis and a we would have dinner together every one'sday night and a he would always tell me about his patients he was very careful to keep confidentiality or he would great confidentiality but it say oh yes how is your nursesis no we hade this dream and said this was knw this was this was normal conversation when i was fourteen fifteen years old with my dout and one day i said dad it is really clear to me that through this talking cure a large fraction of your patients feel better and they conquer their depression or or or their obsessive thoughts or things that are blocking them how do you think it works and he says wha we do not really know the mechanics but ultimately when it works it is not working in some ary ferrier realm it is working by changing the biology of the brain and when he said that who w s a lightning bolt went off in my head and i thought well i do not have the kind of personality to be a talking cure sochiatrist i'm not nearly nice enough but i could understand the underline biology may be all do that ah and as you have correctly pointed out when you say the phrase mind body you are talking about to directions youre talking about mental functions affecting the body and then you are also talking about how phenomena in the body affect affect the mind and were understanding much more about how that happens and i think the general thing for your your listeners to appreciate is that we have some culprits here right and generally speaking there are there are two classes of culprits if you want to get signals about the body to the mind there is two ways to do that one of them is through nurons that reach out into the body and sense things and this is referred to as interoception right as opposed to extra reception youre your outward pointing senses these are the senses that moditor your own body and and while we can consciously be aware of a lot of that information a lot of its happening subconsciously your breathing is happening automatically most of the time without you thinking about it and that depends upon censers about your blood chemistry and the state of your lungs and a number of other things that are regulating that process and it is all happening in the brain usually below the level of your conscious attention in addition to the nerl cignals there is also a whole realm of ormonol or diffusible immune signals and what these are is that these are chemicals that are released into the blood stream and that moved throughout the body and that can a a activate nurons in the brain or an other parts of the nervous system to produce changes in a in mental in mental function and i think the real thing that is exciting a lot of people right now has to do with immune signaling molecules there is a class of molecules called cytochinds and cytochlines are basically the signaling harmons of the immune system and they they can flow through the blood stream and through lemphatic fluid a an reach many parts of the body a we have known for a number of years that the specialized receptors for the citochines are found throughout the brain and yet we know very very very little about about what they do and that is going to be an astonishingly fruitful area of scientific researchs but but to give one one exemplare am there are a lot of things these days suggesting a a link between inflammation in the body whether it be in the gut or an other places to depression well how might that work well it could work either through inflammation sensing nuron sending electrical signals to the brain or and it is not either or it could be both it could be immune signaling cytocline molecules produced at the sight of inflammation that then travel through the bloodstream in the emphatic system to then reach the brain bind receptors and have effects and in one of the mysteries about depres tion is that a it is not that tractabltifirmicological therapy if you look at people who suffer with depression about a third of people see significant benefit from modern escessor i and related antie depress in drugs a a bow a thirds the see very tiny benefit and about a third see no benefit at all and part of the reasons because maybe our term depression is too big a bucket depressins actually many different biological disorders and only a subset of those are are help by ussess orisen will need different therapies for the other ones that is certainly part of it a but part of it might actually have to do with inflammation if you think that inflammation is a a risk factor and depression well you could do something very simple right you could you could gobble and i be prophen right there is a whole bunch of ante inflammatory drugs that are very well understood and well what if you just say are right a let us have a study where we have a bunch of depress people and we have them all eat anti in flamatory drugs for a few weeks whan we see if this relieves their depression and the answer seems to be no it does not wel that is that is a little bit hard to understand because they are definitely lynx between inflammation and depression for example one of the early treatments for a for heppetite to se that since been superseded by more modern drugs was a pro inflammatory sit a kine molecule and when you gave ito people to treat their heppetite to see almost everyone became depressed on the sdrug soll this really seems a link likewise there are certain a neurological diseases moltitl sclarosis it turns out the incidents of depression as a com morbidity in multips grosis is enormous and you migt think well there is a trivial reason for that if you are paralyzed from amessor bummed out about life and that is the reason but if you look at people have spinal cord injuries from accidents they actually have maje your depression at a norat a at a rate from people who were uninjured that does not seem to be adisonsciously you are bummed out from being paralyzed although course it is reasonable to be bummed out about being paralyzed but that is not it what happens in amass while there is a bunch of siht of kinds including one calld interlucan sixile six that is elevated massively if you if you take a spinal tap and you look at sreeable spinal fluid and that could be clositive for depressions are all these real reasons to think that inflammation is involved but yet the idea stilibitla messa now what if instead of looking at the general population of depressed people you look at the subset of people that do not respond to escessori ante depressons are they helped by anteand flamatories and there there is a bit of a hint that maybe they are it is not definitive yout theire couple of studies it is it is it is right on the edge but i think this is a really good example of how we are going to see progress very soon in the body to mind part of mind body medicine that is going to be of enormous a benefit to people interesting could i get your thoughts on one candidate hypothesis that i've been thinking about covered depression and a few episodes and un i've had a robin cardart harris im from you see asef and doctor matthew johnson from your very on john hopkins youversee both of whom work a run laboratory studying psycondelics for the treatment of depression on the clinical chils on syllcibon a and to be clear syllcivon stilly legal sbend you criminalize a few places but we are not ting about recreational use for talking about several therapy cessions and then to without sylicivan then to am two point five graham approximately dosages of syllcben given separately again with therapis present and then follow up therapycessions seem to lead to relief of depression in approximately somewhere between sixty five and eighty per cent of people nom in some cases total remission in some cases a some relief without remission oke we can conset that result on the shelf it is been repeated a number of different times compare that to the results of essessorise which seem to help a third of people a third minimally and a third not at all and of course there is a side effect profiles of the assessorise and associated drugs not just the asessorize but roprioron and the other antitopreses a that are taken in prescription drog form and then there is thi a inflammation piece could we hypothesize that relief from depression has something to do with neuroplasticity rewiring of neural circuits and that syllicibon we know can incourage neuro plasticity and that perhaps essessorise can encourage neuro plasticity in some people not all and that inflammation is a barrier to neuroplasticity a to me this is the only thing that can reconcile the the current status of the of the results and then there is cadamine base therapies and we have to also set that on the shelf pu let us set that aside on the shel fer now to keep it simple a it seems to me that based on the time course over which escessorise work the fact that they increase seratonan a very quickly but the relief from depression comes much later the fact that neuromagelayers seratonan are intimately involved in neuro plasticity they can in some cases gate neuroplasticy that at all centers back to changing neural circuits and what were really tring to do whether not its transcrin o magnetic stimulation are now we can throcedemin in theire r cylicibe in or ascessorise rthat treating depression is about rewiring the brain it is not about chemical a or be per say although ceratonian seems involved to me what i'd love to see is are more studies about the interaction between neurowplasticity and inflammation and are we seeing that kind of work out there and on because these results sort of sid as desperate somewhat conflicting but it seems inflammation is is anti nerow plasticity and broadly speaking here i realize that theire many interlucans there are many i know some of which are inflammatory summere which are anti inflammatory but is that is that a meaningful hypothesis and it am can d'do you think there is any hope what soever to actually cure depression if we if we sor start to a a unify that th te the results in these different camps yet i think it is a completely reasonable hypothesis and i would be broader and i would say honestly the relief of any ner psychiatric condition ultimately istremnera plasticity and some form or and other and i think it is worth while to step back a bit and talk about what neral plasticity means a to date there has been a focus on synapses on the contacts between theur ons as the sight of norplasticity and bats warranted synapses are plastic they changes a result of experience as result of wharmon changes as result of exercise is a results of lots of things but synapses are not the be all an end all of neral function for example nons work by sending electrical signals ah along their lengths and and between neronsan intor converting those chemical signals and the processes of generating those electrical signals the iron channels that are involves that are inbedded in membranes theyare involved in that are also plastic they can also change as a result of experience that is what we call intrinsic plasticity is opposed to scynaptic plasticity in addition there are literal morphological changes when we talk about the wiring of the brain sometimes we are talking about literal wiring sell a was not connected to cell b and now it is and that changes and then sometimes well actually cella was conected cell b but cell b was not responsive enough and ow theres of change in cell b synow cella can fire cell b and that could ben a result of a change in at synaps making it morereswhat receptive torna chancemit are release from cella or it could be something intrinsic and cellay that makes it fire its electrical signal it spike more easily i think that one of the key cell types that is going to be important for your hypothesis a linking inflammation to scynaptic plasticity is going to be a cell call t a microgleal cell and micro gleal cells ar nonroal cells in the brain their motile they can crawl around they have long procesies and they can gobbl things up they can literally sort of chew a way and digest bits of the extra calor scaffolding that surrounds nerons and scynapses and thereby renders them plastic they can a destroy synapses and there is a lot of indication that certain diseastates may involve over exuberant microglea pruning synapses to a degree that they should not and we know that microglea are chock full of cydacine recepters and are responsive to inflammatory signals when we are t alking about inflammation and were talking about drugs it is worth while to mention that there are a lot of behavioral things that also can influence the signaling we know and i know you have discussed on your programm the incredibly sulubrious effects of physical exercise on mental function exercise is about as good and antidopressent as escess our eyes are and the side effects are only good side effects as supposed to the madside effects of escess our eyes and again this is not working through some airy ferrie realm the reason that exercise works to relieve depression and the reason that exercise workston maintain your cognative function as you age is because of biological pathways that we are now un covering some of which well involve my real cells and nurons and other types of sells in th brains some of which will involve not the nurons in the brains at all but the brains vasculatsure we know that exercise is very solubrious for keeping blood flowing to the brain and when you are young you have a superbundance of blood flowing to your brainso it does not matter if it is reduced transiently your fine but as you get older ah your blood vessels become more ecluded and less elastic and your closer to the to the to the trouble spot ah and if you exercise regularly you can dilate and make your blood vessels including those in your brain more elastic and that is almost certainly protective against both depression and cognitive decline a as we age i am a fan of exercise but unfortunate that i enjoy running in some forms of resistance training i always assumeg that the good side effects were just the positive mod effects am until the recent literature that as you mentioned a improve vascly vasculatour blood flow and rereduced inflammation if not during the exercise when inflammation actually increases am decreases inflammation a i'v delighted to hear you say the were michroglea and a my postock advisr the late ben barriss would be especially delighted people can look up ben i'll prvide a link to his sem a biography in the shownote captions because he really champion am to the point of of a i' now of champions even a sufficient word iming ben was beating the drum saying we have to pay attention to glea we have to pay attention to glea for the longest time gleo were relegated to these other journals even have their own journals and in the last what is it ten years there is been a the kind of explosion of research exploring the role of michrogleand other gleol selltypes and it is its really fantastic to see that a this actually the most abundant selltype in the brain is the the gleol cell am are getting the attention they deserve it is absolutely true a am a we sciencis to think that were very rational creatures and were not subject to fads but we totally are right when i started out in this field in the early ades everything was about opioi peptides and then there was a period were gashousner transmitters nitrick oxide were all the rageand you nare right now gleare in the spotlikht for good reason i'm notm grying to say r that that it is not worth while but there is this phenomenon of things being fattish and people jumping on band wagons than it happens both in terms of the subject we study but also in terms of the technique swes and right now the technique that is most fattish involves single sell expression profiling that is creating a list of what geans are turned on and how strong r they are turned on in single cells and seeing how that changes in different saltypes and with experience and it is a very it is a very valuable technique but one could argue that it is perhaps a bit overused on tha fifteen years from now people will go back and say gotch those folks in twenty twenty three were really overdoing with the single salt profiling and and if any one sing about getting into the field of narrow science or another area of biological or other research i can just tell you that if your starting your page o year your post ock take a look at whatever fat is happening now and just know that in five years it will be something different and it takes to you about five years to finish your page to your post ocks ofll pick something different then what is fatish now and you will you will land right on the money that there is always a lot to do you do not have to do what every one else is doing and indeed i the delicion test becomes relevant here 'm the delicion test as it was described to be by my colleague j c chonisky it stamford is i'm if you look around and you see i'm one or more groups i'm doing what you want to do very well just pick something else your life's can to be a lot more pleasant i absolutely i agree with ha with ajaon tha i entirely let us get back to mine body i'm there are bunch of different domains of mine body as he i'm aptly pointed out it is by directional mind informs the body body informs the mind i'm but we could probably break this down into a respiration breathing i'm conscious patterns of breathing i'm emphasizing inhales are emphasizing exals syclic hy preventilating et cetera could also be thought patterns i'm the will bit harder break those down but i'm many not all but many forms of meditation involve having a very still body not all there is walking meditation et cetera but still body i'mfocassed mind kind of a not a state that we are in a lot of times unless we direct that state am there are still other mind body patterns of communication through very still body deep relaxation things ogonedra nonsly deep reast an there is hypnosis there is a a touch based body mind communication fore can ht talk about mine body also we should refer to his body mind a how do we dithe in and think about this cause this is involving clearly a thousand dfferent naural pathways not just the vaguest nerveas it is cot the n o typically people jois kind of hang their had on mind body must be vaguest nerve and of course it involves the vagus but the vagus is an extensive said of pathways an how do you to frame up mine body and what is most intriguing to you about mine body communication both in terms of the biology and its practical aplications well i think just as we talked about how theire two potential pathways in conveying signals from the body to the mind there are also to potential pathways at least two potential pathways to conveying signals from the brain to the body and they are the the the neral signals that are conveyed by nurans that actually get there and they are a hormons and nerve transmitters and siticines that re released from the brain i should mention that that hormons are actually produced by nerons including for example some of the hormones that you think about as being produced as sex hormones estergon is produced by nerons in your brain for example am let me give an example that i think is a bit out there but i think is really really fascinating and this comes from a from the cancer world and a melonoma is a is a is a bad cancer it kills a lot of people that can spread it is a highly metestatic an we know that melanomas often become enervated that is to say they become contact by nurons and rapt and receive signals from them and we also now that if a melanoma becomes enervated then the prognosis for that patient is worse it is more likely to grow it is more likely to spread well how does that happen well recently a there have been some reports that a show that nurons that enervate the melanoma do not act directly on to the tumor cells rather what they dos they secrete a signaling molecule that has a recepter on immune cells that are patrolling the edges of the melanomatumer and nibbling away at it and they when that signally molecules released from the nuron it a shuts down rreduces that immune patroling function and than as a consequence the tumor can grow and spread and but off more readily said the signal that comes from nurons is sending the embulences home to speak ya exactly on the and the signal is something called calcitone and gene related peptite or s g ar p a unfamiliar with segeurope from the domain of touch in its involvement in an think lik ich perception idoan perception and its perception all right ya and are right if nurons can on can effect the progression of cants er through their activity and these narons in the perfrey are ultimately connected to the brained through a couple of different hops then is it reasonable to hypothesize that mental processes could effect cancer progression let us say we ave hypothesis endence a while hypothesis and i want to just emphasize that there is not evidence for this but let us make the hypothesis that says that through meditative practis you can slow the progression of certain tumors that tend to get interfated right well right now this is just kind of a wild idea but i think the important thing as i've said before that this is a wild idea with the biological substrate it is not you meditate and magic happens and forcefields open in the angel sing and then you are tumor shrinks this is we are saying that activity in certain areas of the brain is increased by this meditative practise and that this send signals to this narona this naron that actually go to the tumor and make something happen through this biochemical pathway that we have defined right and to me this is speculative but it is also extraordinarily exciting right it opens a kind of investigation of mind to body signaling that as received very little attention up to now incredible an i say incredible because while you are giving an example of sigierpe innerv innervation an medistatic a tumors i absolutely love the idea that a phenomenon involving some practise that could be put under the umbrella of mind body or body mind am become something in tirely different when we are tryin it hang that on the hook of a biological process sike something fundamentally changes there i am it is amazing to me for instance that early on psychodelics and breathwork conscious breathwork a we are lumped together costpeople their jobs at major universities i will not name the universities cause we are all you work at one eye work at another and the is a third one i'm called harvard i guess i just name them am but nowadays therre laboratories at every single one of those institutions studying deliberate respiration on health as well as psychodelics am and meditation for that matter am with the goal of understanding what psytakinds what narrow transmitters et cetera change through defined pathways including vaguus but frantic nerves and a frontal cortac in all the stuff that is considered classic rigorous nero science i do think we we have entered a new eura am it is not costing people their jobs any more it is eially giving people their jobs and it is federally funded which itself is also fantastic in my opinion we are in a new eura what what do you think am needs to be done to really nail down the idea that how we think influences are biology even though it is a total du because everyone knows that schronic stress for instance as can be detrimental short from strss cannashally be beneficial but a and stress is a mental process that esentially deploys chemicals in the body that then create other issues in the body that then create shifts in mental processs i's it is obvious when it spelled out but it is just remarkable to me how this is just been lumped in the category of woo science on and i cannot quite figure out what means to be done in order to convince people that their nervous system include stuff outside the skull in spinal cord and of course of course of course it would work this way well right and i think it is the job of biomedical researcturs right now to reclaim a lot of this from from the realm of nonsense and the problmis there has been a lot of nonsense and there is there is sort of visslral reaction you n when some one says oh yeh well you can do rethbreath work and little real line yor shockeras and that is what will a reduce your anxietyo god inflammation and i'm tempted to sco ore shut up but what if the shockas ar collections of nerve innervation oa bodily s phink tor we know make sense rigt it could but it is got tha there is got to be some some billy in some cases these analogies are rooted in something real and in some cases there just made up bulshit ight and i think the challenge is to have really rigorous scientific tests of these things to take it back and to be willing to say all right therehave been a lot of claims for example made about how mental processes can influence the body and only a subset of those are ging to be true and of that subset it is our job to understand how they work both to rationalize them but also to optimize them and and make them better i mean there is no question that mental process is affect the body i mean we know for example that if we just keep you awake and do not let you sleep long enough you will die and what will you dive from youl die from sepses because the the barrier between your gut contents ah and and your perneum will well well well break down right well how does that happen i we are just starting to understand i there is a really dramatic example but there gong to be many more subtle example you you have mentioned breathwork a couple of times and i think this is really interesting a my colleagues who are interested in respiration tell me that you can record in many different places in the brain many different places in the new qartex and other regions and find a signature of the breathing rhythm sort of as a background ah teneral activity you can find in the cerabellum you can find it in the frontal qartex you can find it in ah the ha benula which is implicated many things including depression you can find a lots of places the idea that conscious modulation of your breathing could have manifold affects honoral function i think it is reasonable given that kind of observation her hear it is talk about you a bit a more a you have been gracious in covering this wide array of topics and with such eloquence and i must say have been delighting in all of it you are in a unique position these days because a if i understand correctly a you have been diagnosed with a fatal illness i suppose we have all been diagnosed with the fatal illness of sor because av we are all going to die sooner or later an if you are willing could you tell us the story of how that diagnosis came to be what your initial reaction was and where things stand now and and perhaps we can explore some of the malitia say pleasant surprises that ever emerged am since that initial diagnosis well surely be happy to a in the a the a summer of twenty twenty a in the dark days of covit when things were looking really bad i developed profound shortness of breath i could not get up a flight of stairs without a awithout huffing and puffing and i thought oh well i've got covit but i took coved vests and there was they at ta they wer all negative i thought o i must have covit i've got the symptoms of covid i have respiratory issues on feeling week it is got a be covid and after a while when this did not go away my wife's at let you got a goin to the doctor this is crazy its you got find out what is going on and i did and they athey hooked me up to an electri cartia gram and they said oh a you have got atrial fibulation meaning that your heart is doing two beats every time it should do once have a very high heart rate and when the heart beats that fast it cannot work very effectively there it is enough time to recharge before the next beat comes now it turns out that there is a very straight forword therapy for this a atral fibulation comes from a electrical signalling in the heart sort of swirling about in a circle and and reactivating part of the heart muscle faster than it should and if you thread through a cather in your in your in your inneur groin up a up through blood vessels you can put in a little needle and use that quaderiyes into a blate a tiny little strip of cells in the heart that will produce a barrier that will prevents that a abberance return of electric electivity and will cure atril fibulation i have that process that oblation surgery and sure enough it it cured my atral fibrulation i was feeling terrific and they said oh as a follow up come back a few months later and well do an echo cardiagram to see how your heart looks and they did and i went only god there is this huge mass pressing against your heart it is the size ofa cot can here is what we think it is we think it is a hatal hernea we think your stomach has poked up through the die fram muscle and it is nestling next to your hearts the way we diagnosis kind of humoros they say chug this can of diet doctor pepper and then quickly get up on the table and will do the echocardio gram and in the echocardiogram we can see a signature of the popping see o two bubbles in your soda and if we see those in the mass than we know its your stomach i did it i chuck that i got up ther up no it is not your stomach its ait on well what we think this is is a teratomach and a teratoma is a develop mental anomaly that you carry usually from feedal life where there is a group of different cells that gets in a place where it should not durn development and ten grows you have probably heard about people who sometimes get a a tooth that grows haire in their abdmen sometimes women have these around their overies and the're not malignant they do not spread it is a fairly easy thing but i have this enormous cot can pressing on my heart it may have we do not know have been the source of my atrol fibulation to start with but in order to deal with this i had to have open heart surgery i had the surgery and ond it was a big harrybeal i was told we last about five hours it turns out at last to two days o they hav me on the heart lung bipast machine longer than you are supposed to bes yofre very likely to throw a clot and get a stroke fortunaty that did not happen i had very skilled surgeons at john's hopkins it was bleeding much that they could not close the chest theyhad to do all the surgery and the just leave me and estetized with my chest open until the bleeding stop in the surgery was a bare and then i'm waiting to get the pathology report back on the tissue they removed tand it came back and it was bad news sorry it is not a terratoma it is not benign it is a kind of cancer called sonovial sarcoma and sonoial sarcoma is a moderately rare cancer and it usually effects the sonovium which is the lining of the joints or some other places it is pretty rare to have it happen in the heart there are a few examples if you look in the biomedical literature for common cancers testistic tisticular cancer a breast cancer there are huge tables ofstatisticsor millions of patients on what is been tried an what works in what the probnosis is for sonovial sarcoma of the heart there only individual case reports oh there is a guy in canya and he got in this what happeneders here is there there is there is a woman and menesoda and this is what happened with her wright ther're no statistics because because it is that rare and and and the oncologist said well i think you have got six to eighteen months to live now this was a about a now twenty seven months ago i've fortunately a exceeded that life'span estimate and i think we got to be clear also that bean ancologist has got to be a terrible job for many reasons but one of them is that you got to give a lifespan estimate even if you really do not have the data to do it in a very infor wou cannot to say i will not do it right you got to do it people expect it you i'm not saying old the oncollogistless incompetent because i've owlived my estimate you was trying to do something based on very little information made his best guess om i got this information and i was furious i was angry hart cantsr who thehell gants heart cancers that even a thing i've ever heard of somebody with heart cancer nontill no heart cancer what thf i've got heart cantcer this is this is crazy time i was fifty nine years old as hat a lot to do i cannot have heart caner anmd what was i think transformative for me is that at the same time that i was feeling a white hot angry with the universe i was also feeling a deep sense of gratitude for what i've had i've had a terrific life i'm not that young i've had a lot of it and i had great parents wonderful friends growing up i've had a good career ah it is been a fairly easy run of it om and i think the ability to have a job where you follow your own curiosity every day there is nothing that few people in the world get to live that way i feel incredibly grateful i feel incredibly gateful in my family and i have a wonderful wife named dena and she is just the best how do i deserve this i do not deserve herg honestly om in neurow science we often think oh well there is a you have a ate you have a sat point are you anxious or are you relaxed are you fleeing or you approaching it is it is a single axis well but it is not hend i think most people understand that but but done me i did not until that moment really understand that i could feel profoundly grateful and profoundly angry in the very in the very same moment and having cantsir and getting the kind of treatments the kimo the radiation it is famously deeply unpleasant and i had all that and was just as unpleasant as anyone's cancer story that that that you have heard the radiation burned my asophagus i could not eat for weeks it was months it was painful to swallow in a bad stuff lots of people have have had to have bad stuff this and and what i it realize yet this is it is a deeply om unimpowering situation to be a medical patient what particulary when there is something serious you have you have a limited sense of agency things are being done to you drugs go ino that make you feel really bad and there is not there is not that much to do when i realized that for me the sense of agency came froun being curious from being a total nured about things and part of what it made me curious about was my own mental processies as they related to my cancir and my cancer diagnosis for example i'm getting the kimo and i should to say as background i'm fortunate i i do not have a tendency for depression i'm a pretty up god i do not take any credit for that i think i was just born lucky and and raise lucky i but day after day of feeling bad in your body from keemo by it is hard to be positive it really is i could not overcome my mood god really really lo and i could tell myself this is going to be over it is not going to go on for ever you will not feel this way for ever and you would think that as a rational person i could talk myself out of that mood but i could not probably because there was my brain was a wash and interlucan six and i could not overcome what i felt really low but at the same time i was sort of out a remove being a nerd about going i bet these side of kinds ar messing me upright now but that is what is going on and that gave me some sense of age and sea and a time were otherwise i really would not have another thing it really brought home to me is this issue that we were discussing earlier about how malliable perception is and perception of time in particular if some one had said to me when i was healthy before i was diacnosed you are going to die in five years i would gone oh no no no i'm fifty nine years old i shuld get way more than five years i a lot of things to do aprofessional things personal things family things i gall of things to do no that would not be i'd be very upset but if you told me after my diagnosis of sixty eighteen months oh you get five years i five years ye thate's pretty good i can do a lot in five years i can finish op in the lab and i can i can do some good work and i can spend time with my family and travel and savor life's pleasures an to all kinds of things five years great and of course it is the same five years right the only thing its different is the is the context but i think the thing that really i realize the most is that i really could not and still cannot engaged with the idea of myself being gone yet i can do practical things i can update my will i can write letters for my people in my lab if i kick off they have got that to take to their next job you now i can do all these nuts and bolts things but in terms of genuinely engaging with my own demise i really find that as much as i try i really cannot do that and at first i thought well that is just your own lack of imagination than it is just because you are not very good of this but the more i thought about it i thought actually know this is a human thing this is a fundamental human thing and and one of the things when i look back on the forty pluss years i've been doing near a science that is different is that when i was first trained the brain was really described as a react ofe structure something happens in the world it comes to your sense organs your eyes your ears at goes into your brain at triggers and things you you think you make decisions and then you make an action that goes out your muscles or orand that is the loop and that is what the brain does and what we have known in more recent years is that actually when the brain is waiting for something to happen it is not just idling and spacing now that the brain is at every moment subconsciously trying to predict the in your future predicting the near future is predicated on the idea that there will be a near future that is to say that you will not be dead and gone right that they will be a future for you and i think that my ability which i think is actualla a human i mean not my ability my failure which i think is actually human failure to truly engage with my own demise is a feature it is it is a side effect of the fact that the brain is always trying to predict the future and that was interesting to me just as a way that my illness was revealing something about the brain but it also made me think a lot about the world's religions religionis everywhere in the world if you ask anthropologists is there any society that does not have religious ideas tey'll say no they saiy they doft always have the word religion they meant to say well yet in this place everybody knows that the worlds on the back of a turtle and ta this in this append there are these rules they may not call it religion but every place in the world has religion not everyone is religious but it is a cross cultural universal and most religions not absolutely every single one but almost every single one has stories of after life or reincarnation in which your consciousness indores well why would that be many religions they have got a deal right follow these rules in life and then you will be rewarded in the after life and that is it that is a very a very general idea or bellunished in the after or punished an afterart and in wen some f religions you mells with the divine in other religions you reincarnated as this or that is nothe heaven or hell right there is there is variance but but they share that your consciousness endures and whise this popular all over the world well i would hypothesize that it is acide effect of the fact that the brain cannot hel ll but always trying to predict the future when we cannot a magum the world without us in uts them we are forced to concoct stories of the after life fascinating and makes me want to ask about this feature of time perception am my undergraduate graduate and postoc advisers all sadly died earlier early really by a petty much any standard am and i was fortunate enough to be in communication with the the last to as they were going through that process a both of them described am a heightened sense of gratitude especially for things that previously they had not paid attention to we call this noticing the little things yesbut am that makes me conclude that something about the knowledge of one's impending death however far off that might be am shifts our attention at least temporarily leads to this sense of slowing down a bit because in order to shift our attention to could not quot the little things were things that we previously overlooked am there is the sense of slowing down and we know from a basic a vidiography phorotography that slowing down means an increase in frame rate i it a you shooting it a strope frame rates gives you the strict perception a strobe am shooting at very high frame rates allows you to see things in very slow motion your noticing subtle variations that normally you overlook am i d not try to be overly reductionist about this a this process of enhanced gratitude am that is a that you describe and how it was alongside intense anger but have you noticed a shift in your perception of time because you were given initially this o k ex number of months and then now with the you are still here fortunately and with this andopen ended well it was not the prediction that was given t you by your oncologist but it is unclear how long you are going to be here right a which is how most of us exist you have the sense that it' sooner rather than later but you do not really know i'm curious as to how the idea that o k you have twelve months more to live verses more than twelve months but not infinite but of course i know that i have hopefully have more than twelve months but it is not infinite this this idea of thit the finish line the cliff leaving aside whatever might happen afterwards i do not know have not been there m it changes what we notice by way of changing our perception of time m a this is a this is a profound tuning of our perception what are your thoughts on that and and do you notice the each sip of coffee you probably do not notice each step across the kitchen floor in the morning you i paying attention to your lovely wife and kids and things that day but presumably it is dynamic but what is your perception of time now with the understanding that yes you made it through the passed the gate that was predicted but what is lies ahead is is uncertain ye that is really interesting and i would say definitely my perception of time as slower and it seems an age since i was dieve nos but i think part of that is because it is been action packed and ofthe words since i was dic nost many emotionally salient things non trivial things have happened many intense discussions with my wife and my friends and the people in my lab i my wife and i've taken a lot more vacations than we normally to and were running all over the world and there is a certain sense of of packing it in that i think influenceis time perception but i would say actually for me personally the gratitude is not about the little things the gratitude is about the very biggest things the gratitude is gratitude for being esentient being and having about blessing the gratitude is for being able to have a life where i can follow my own ideas and creativity and my gratitude is for choke up the profound love that i felt for my wife and my children you ates sout the little stuff it is the bigg stuff that i think about when i think about gratitude is not noticing the sof tea it is it is the biggest es and you kdo not for me i i do not i wanted to lay my death as much as possible of course but o when i think about it the part that makes me upset is leaving people behind it is not for myself i've i've hot a great life i've hot a lot of it i'm sixty one i to go longer but thats that is a pretty good rum i've gone to do lots of things an those sixty one years i a have wonderful loving interconnected experiences and the negative part is about what i leave behimd certainly what you have left behind is enormous am and has been the consequence of actions long before your diagnosis which i think it is a is a clear lesson to everyone am i cannot speak for you but do not wait for the diagnosis am you have mentioned the sense of agency ah that you have felt a by being able to pay attention to an exploreyour experience of let us call it what it is impending death am and at the same time you is you mention you have amplified and a accelerated the number of things that you have put into the world recently writing incredible am articles about your experience of life and death and we course link to thos people can read them am i've read them all and they are a profound and they do not just feel important they clearly are important am very few people have a you are inside into the nervous system at the mechanistic level but also at this more halistic level that am youe clearly displayed to us here and in y and in your research and in your book writing and public speaking am i think it is a it is a risky thing to ask a somebody for advice am but i cannot help myself because am i think it is a it is a real opportunity am if you had advice am to give to any in all of us am based on the whole experience no aall of it from go as they say am if if you are willing and feel free to pass but if you are willing am what is your advice o i would say the advice that is really universal is what everybody already knows and is a bit trigt but i'll say it anyway and that is appreciate what you got while you got it and this is not any big secret and everyone knows it i would say for a subset of people the way of the nerd is very empowering i do not think that is the case for everyone i think for a subset of people who are deeply curious as there nature turning that curiosity to your own mortality in your own medical situation can be impowering and and useful but i do not think that should be broad advice i think that is only for fraction people us try the worst thing they could do and there is nothing wrong without everybody's everybody's difference right not everyone should adopt the way of the nerved but for a fraction of people it is a really really good thing to do this is normally the portion of a conversation with a guest where i list off the many many things they have done and how grateful i am and and all that is absolutely true in the case of at you being here to day and the work you have done but i think it self evident how much you have a con just accomplish but how much knowledge youv put into the world and not just scientific knowledge but knowledge about the human experience of others and of yourself and i just want to extended a giant thank you on behalf of the listeners and viewers and myself thank you for coming here

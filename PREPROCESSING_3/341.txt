welcome to the huberman laponcans discu science science pace to for i mindrhuberman and ofm a professor of nerobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day marks the first journal club episode between myself and doctor peter attea for any of you that are not familiar with doctor peter attea he is a medical doctorine m d who is in expert in all aspects of health and life span he is the author of a best selling book entitled outlive which is a phenominal resource on all things health span and life span and he is the host of the very popular podcast the drive where he interviews various experts in all domains of medicine and scientists as well today peter and i hold our first on line collaborative journal club for those of you that are not familiar with what a journal club is a journal club is a common practice in graduate school and rmedical school where by students get together to discuss one or two papers to cretique those papers and to really compare their own conclusions of those papers with the conclusions of the authors and to highlate any h take aways peter and i have been wanting to do a journal club together for a very long time and we decided to do that journal club and to record it for you to day you will be sitting in on the first huberman a t a journal club by the way it could just have easily been called the atea huberman journal club and we will discuss two papers first peter is going to discuss a paper on met foreman which is a drug that many people are interested in for its potential roll in longevity i want a highlike potential there he is going to compare that paper to previous findings on metforeman and by the end of that discussion he will advise as to whether or not he himself would take metforeman and whether or not other people might be well advised or ill advised to take metforeman based on the data in that paper and at this time then i present a paper which is about the placebo effect i have to imagine that most of you h ve heard of the placebo effect but wh t's interesting about the paper that we discussd today is that it shows that the placebo effect can actually follow a dose response its notjhus all or none it actually is the case that you can scale the degree of placebo effect depending on whether not you'r thinking you are taking lo doseis moderate doses or hi doses of our particular drug and the particular drug that is discussed in the paper that i cover is nicketine for those of you that are interested in cognitive enhancement by way of pharmocology or frankly for people who are simply interested in how our beliefs can shape our physiology i think yu'll find that discussion to be very interesting by the end of to day's episode you will not only have learned about two novel sets of findings one in the realm of longevity as it relates to met foreman and another in the realm of neurobiology and placebos or placebo effects but you will also learn how a journal club is conducted thin you will see and observing how we parch these papers and discuss them even arguing in them at times that what scientists an clinations do is they take a look at the existing pure reviewed research and they look at that pure reviewd research with a fresh eye asking does this paper really show what it claims to show or not and in some cases the answer is yes in another cases the answer is no what i know is for certain is that by the end of to day's episode you will learn a lot of science you will learn a lot about health practices some of which you may want to apply or avoid and you will learn a lot about how science in medicine is carried out before we begin id to emphasize at this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science in science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is helic sleep helic sleep makes customize mattresses to give you the best possible night sleep now sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance when we are sleeping well and enough mental health physical health and performance all stand to be at their best one of the keythings to getting a great night's sleep is to make sure that your mattress is tailor to your unique sleep needs helick sleep has a brief two minute quiz that if you go to their websiht you take that quiz an answer questions such as do you tend to sleep on your back your sid your stomach you tend to run hot or cold in the middle the night may you do not know the answers to those questions and that is fine at the end of that two minute quiz they will match you to a mattress that is ideal for your sleep needs i sleep on the duskka do you ask ky mattres and when i started sleeping on a dusk mattress about two years ago my sleep immediately improve if you are interested in upgrating your mattress go to helic sleep dok calm slash hubermen take their two minute sleep quiz and they will match you to a customize mattress for you and you will get up to three hundred fifty dollars off any mattress order and two free pillows again if interested go to helick sleep dok calm slash hubermen for u to three hundred fifty dollars off and two free pillows to day's episode is also brought to us by levels levels is a programme that lets you see how different foods and behaviors affect your health by giving you real time feed back using a continuous gluco smonitor one of the most important factors impacting your immediate and long turm health is the way that your body manages its blood glucos or sometimes refer to is blood sugar levels to maintain energy and focuss throughout the day you want to keep your blood luco steady without big spikes or dips using levels you can monitor how different types of foods and different food comminations as well as food timing and things exercise combine to impact your blood luco s levels i starte using levels a little over a year ago and it give me a lot of inside into house specific foods were spiking my blood sugar and then leaving me feeling tired for several hours afterwards as well as how the spacing of exercise and my meals was impacting my over all energy and in doing it really allowed me to optimize how i eat what i eat when i exercise and on such that my blood glucos levels and energy levels are stable throughout the day if you areinterested in learning more about levels and trying a continuous glucos monitor yourself go to levels dot link slash huberman right now levels is offering an additional two free months of membership again that is level's dot link ally and k slash hubermen to get two free months of membership and now for my journal club discussion with doctor peter a tea peter good to have you here agreet to be here my friend this is something t you and i have been wanting to do for a while and it is basiy something that we do all the time which is to peruse the literature and find papers that we are excited about for whatever reason and often times that will lead to a text dialogue or a phone call we are both but this time we have opted to try talking about these papers that we find particularly exciting in real time for the first time as this podcast form at first of all that people can get some sense of why we are excited about these papers we we do feel that im people should know about these findings and second of all that it is an opportunity for people to learn how to dissect information and think about the papers they hear about in the news the papers they might down load from pubmet if they are inclined sugjust to start thinking scientists inclinations and get a better sense of what it looks to pick through a paper i'm the god the bat in the ugly we are flying a litle blind here which is fun im i'm defly excited for all the above reasons ye now this is e you and i've been talking about this for some time and and a actually we used to run a journal club inside to practice where once a mont one person would a just pick a paper and you would go through and cont of a formal journal club presentation we have got in away from a last you are just because we have been a little stretch then i think it something we need to resume because it is a it is a great way to learn and it is a skill people probably ask you all the time bcause i know i get asked all the time hey what are the dus and do not of interpreting scientific papers is it enough to just read the abstract m and nown usually answer is well no im but the how to is is tougher and i think thet two papers we have chosen to day illustrate two opposite ends of the spectrum your on ovs yo talk about something at we aregon a probably get into the technical nature of the assaes the limitations et cetera and the paper ultimately i've chosen to present although i apologize i'm surprising you with this u unti a few minutes ago is is actually very straightforward simple epidemeologic paper that i think has important significance i had originally gone down the rabbit hole on a much more neuanced paper about a t p binding casettes in clusteral absorption but ultimately i thought this one might be more interesting to a broader audience by the i con t tellyour hony story i had a dream last night about you and am in this dream you were obsesse with making this certain drink that was your elicor and it had all of these crazy ingreedients in it si on som tons of supplements an i but the one thing i remembered when i woke up cause i forgot most of them i was really trying hard to remember them one thing tht you had in it was due you had to collect a certain amount of duew off the leaves every morning to put into this dri who it is just ound something that i would do and and but here is the best part you had you had a thermus of this stuff that had to be with you everywhere and all of your clothing had to be tailored with a special pocket that you could put the thermus into that you were never without the special andrew drink and again how dreams when you are having them seem logical and real nd the you wake up and your hat doesn' v make sense why would he want the thermus in his shirt that thit would warm it up it all theys but but by it was a realistic dream and there were lots of things in it including de spaspecial due off the leaves every morning i lo it well it is not that far from reality im big am fan a yeurbomati i'm drinking it right now an d an i am in it is many forms usually the loose leaf i do not tend to drink it out the gord my dads argentine that is where i picked it up i's tour drinking it when i was five years old or younger which i do not recommend people to its hevily cafny do not drink the smoke divisions either folks i think that was pretentially carsonagenic but this thing thi you describe of carring round the thermis close to the body if you are ever in urgui or if you ever spot grown men in a restaurant anywhere in the world carrying a thirmist with them and to their meals and and hugging it close chances are there rguine and they are drinking your mamate they drink it usually after their meals spostoby good for your digestion i's not that far from from reality i do not carry the thermis but i do drink mate every day and i'm mus tart collecting du off the leaves just a few drocks every morning thinon why ah some other time we can talk about dreams recently i've 've been doing some dream exploration i've had some absolutely transformative dreams for the first time in my life one dream in particular that it has that allowed me to feel something i've never felt before and has catalized a large number of important decisions in a way that no other experience waking or sleep has ever impacted me and this was drug free et cetera aand you think you could have had that dream we do not have to get in throug it if you do not talk about t now but was there a lot of work you had to do to prepare for that dream to have taken place oh yes ye at least a eighteen months of intensive analysis type work with a very skille psychiatriset but i was not trying to seed the dream it was just i was at a sticking point with a certain process in my life and then i was taking a walk while waking and realized that my brain my subconscieus was going to keep working on this i just decide it is goin to keep working on it and then two nights later i travel to a meeting and aspen and i had the most profound dream ever i where i was able to send something and feel something i've always wanted to feel as real within the dream woke up knew it was a dream and realize this is what people close to me that i respect have been talking about but i was able to feel it and therefore i can actually access tes in my waking life tha itwas as it was absolutely transformative for me im anyway sometime i can share more details with you ere the audience but for now i wish to talk about these papers very wone im pushu go first i i'm happy to go first trs fon otthis sen ss a pretty ster for paper beregn a talk about a paper titled reassessing the evidence of a survival advantage and type to diabetics treated with metforeman compared with controls without diabetes a retrospective cohort study s by matthew thomas keys and colleagues this was published a last fall im why is this paper important this paper is important because in two thousand fourteen a banister published a paper that i think in many ways kind ofe got the world very excited about metformance tis almost ten years ago and i'm sure many people have heard about this paper even if they are not familiar with they have heard the concept of the paper and in many ways it is the paper that has led to the excitement around the potential for gero protection we have met format and i should probe jous to find for the audience what gero protection means when we thand cobly also sorry to interup what met foreman is just out of the uninforout that that is a great point 's i'll start with with the latter metforeman is a drug that has been used for many years a depends where it was first approved i think was in europe im but you do not call it directionally fifty plus years of use as a first line agent for patience would type to di obedies ain the you ess maybe forty plus years this is a drug that is been around for ever trade name a glucofage a branname and a butbody ge its you knowts generic drug to day the mechanism by which met foreman works is debated hotly but what i think it is not debated is the immediate thing that met foreman does which is it inhibits complex one of the mitocondria again maybe jus taking a step back the mitacondrea as everybody thinks of those is the cellular engine for making a t p o the most efficient way that we make a t p is through oxidated phosphorelation where we take either fatiacid pieces or a break down product of glue cost once its partialy metabolized to piruve we put that into an electoron transport chain and we basically trade chemical energy for electrons that can then be used to make phosphates on to a d p it is you kow you think of everything you do eating is taking the chemical energy and food taking the energy that is in those bonds making electrical energy in the mitocondria those electrons pompa gradiant that allow you to make a t p to give u sense of how primal and important this is if you block that process completely you die everybody's probably herd of scionite rite sionite is something that is incredibly toxic even at the smallest doses scionide is a complete blocker of this process and if my memory serves me correctly i think it block complex for of the mitocondria ido not if you recall if it complex thregh your complex for may i know a lot about toxins that in back the nervous system but i ontn alot about the ways mitaconly an if ever you want to have some fun we can talk about all the dangerous stuff that animals make and insects make and how they kill you ye ie got te throat any oxin and all these things at li oing lar oan younggers i i really geek out on the stuff oes allows me to talk about ner science animals and scary stuff it is a combines us we can do that someti am frphon maybe at the end if we have a few moments something sionide that is a very potent inhibitor of this at electron transport chain will kill you instantly people understand that of course a drop of sionide and you would you would be dead liteally instantaneously metforman works at the first of those complexas i believe there are four of my memory serves correctly four electron transport chain a complexes and a but of course it is not a complete inhabition of it it is just cond of a weak blocker of that and the net effect of that is what for the net effect of that is that it changes the ratio of a denizene monophosphe to a denisene diphosphy a what is less clear is why does that have a benefit in diabatics because what it unambiguously does is reduces the amount of glucos that the liver puts out hopatic glucos output is one of the fundamental problems that is happening in type two diabedes you may recall i think we talked about the sunan prese podcast you and i sitting here with normal blood sugar have about five grams of glucos in our total circulation that is it five grams think about how quickly the brain will go through that within minutes the only thing that keeps us alive is our livers ability to titrate out glucos and if it puts out too much for example if the glucos if the glucos level was consistently two teaspoons you would have type two diabedes the difference between being metabolically healthy and having you no profound type to diabedes is one teaspoon of glucos and your bloodstrin the ability of the liver to tamp down on high glucofs output is important metforman seems to do that can i jusask a a one question is it fair a to provide this areally simplified summary of the bo chemistry which is that when we eat the food is broken down but the breaking of bonds creates energy that then ourselves can use in the form of e t p and the mitacondraar scentral of that process and that tet forman it is partially short circuiting the energy production process and even though we are eating when we have met foremen in our system presumably there is going to be less net glucos the bonds are gongto be broken down we are chewing were digesting but less of that is turned into blood sugar blucost well sort of i mean it is not am it is not depriving you of ultimately storing bat energy what it is doing is changing the way the body a particions fuel that is probably a better way to think about it to be a little bit more accurate am for example it is not depriving you of the calories that are in that gluecose that would be fantastic but vaaly that was the a elestro let remember a elaztra from the ninty's elestra folks for those whe do not remember am by the way if you ever ate the stuff you would remember ah because it was a fat that was am not easily digested it had in sorvanaligos to plant fibre or something that is being put into potato chips and what not and the idea is that people would would simply excret it am and i do not know what happened except that people got low stomach aches and a well the anly li batter in the world we know that the anal seapige is what really did that promignal see pitch only a physician because after all peter's a clinician for physician and empty and i'm not am could find it a an ippropriate term to describe when you have that a much when you have that much fat mal absorbtion you used ar to have accidents well and that that did away with that product you was either that or the diper industry was t en really agon why you do not hear about elestrsr we have got this drug weve get this drug met form and it is considered a perfect first line agent for people would type to diabede againd what is happening when your type to diabedes a the primary insult probably occurs in the muscles and it is insolent resistance everybody hears that term what dos it mean a insolent is a peptite it binds to a recepter on a cell at's just talk about it through the lens of the muscle cause the muscle is responsible for most glucofs disposal it get's glucos out of the circulation high glucos is toksic we have to put it away and we want to put most of it into our muscles that is where we store seventy five to eighty per cent of it when insolent binds to the insolent receptere a co a tyrisin cinase is triggered inside just ignore all that but a chemical reaction takes place inside the cell that leads to a phosphorelation a t p donates a phosphate group and a transporter just think of a little tunnel a ittle straw goes up through the level of the cell and now glucos can freely flow in some sure you have talked a lot about this with your audience we things that move against gradiance need pumps to move them things that move with gradiance do not glucos is moving with its gradiant into the cell it does not need active transport but it does need the transporter put there that requires the energy that is the job of insolent by the way i did not know that i mean i certainly no active in and passive transport as it relates to no transmitter an i on flow but i never heard that when insolen binds to a cell that literally will straw is placed into the membrane otes does not need a pump to move it in a because there is much more glucos outside to cell than insicht it ju but the energy required is to move the the straw up to the cell soaigy is yat is what happens is as an gerald shalman at yale did the best work on elucidating this as the intremuscular fat increases and i by intremuscular i mean interecellular fat a triasil and diasil glicerides accumulate in a muscle cell that signal gets interrupted and all of a sudden i'm making these numbers up if you used to need two units of i nsolen to trigger the little transporter now you need three and then you need four and then you need five you need more and more insolent to get the thing up that is the definition of insolent resistance the cell is becoming resistant to the effect of insolent and therefore the early mark of insolent resistance the canary in the coal mine is not an increase in glucos it is an increase in insolent normal glycemia with hyper insolenemia especially post prandial meaning after you eat hyper inslanemia is the thing that tells you hay your you'r five ten years away from this being a real problem fast forward many steps down the line some of wou type too diabedes has long passe that system now not only are the insolent resistant where they just need a boat load of insolent which is made by the pancreus to get glucos out of the circulation but now that system's not even working well and now they are not getting glucos into the cell now their glucofs level is elevated and even though it is continually being chewed up and used up because it bagain the brain alone would account for most of that glucofs disposal the liver is now becoming insolent resistant as well and now the liver is not able to regulate how much glucos to put into circulation and it is overdoing it now you have too much glucofs being pumped into the circulation by the liver and you have the muscles that cannot dispose of it and it is really a vicious brutal cascade because the same problem of fat accumulating in the muscle is now starting to happen in the pancreus and now the relatively few cells in the pancreas called bata cells that make insolen are undergoing inflammation due to the fat accumulation within the pancreus itself and now the thing that you need to make more insolent is less effective it making insolent ultimately waywayway down the line a person wit type to diabetes might actually even require insolent exogenously culd you share with us a few of the causes of type tudiabes of insolent resistance mean one itsel his accumulating too much fat yes energy and balance would be an enormous one inactivity or insufficient activity is probably the single most importancte when gerald chellmen a was running clenical trials at yale a they would be recruiting undergrads to study obviously cause you are typically recruiting young people and they would you no be doing these very detailed mechanistic studies where they would require actual tissue biopses you new ue an a biopsy somebody is quadruceps and actually look at what is happening in the muscle well i remember him telling ye this when i interviewd m on my podcats he said the most important criteria of the people we interviewed is cause they were still lean these were not people that were overweight but they had to be inactive you could not have active people in these studies exercising is one of the most important things you are going to do to ward off insolent resistance but there are other things that can cause and slone resistance sleep deprovation has a profound impact on inslent resistance i think we probably talked about this previously but if you u knw som very elegant mechanistic studies where you sleep deprive people you let them only sleep for four hours for a week you will reduce their glucofs disposal by about half whele which is i mean thit is a staggering amount yo you are basically inducing profound insolen resistance in just a week of sleep deprobation hypercordosolemia is another factor and then obviously energy and balance where when you are when you are accumulating eccess energy when you are getting fatter if you start spilling that fat outside of the subcutaneous fat cells into the muscle into the liver into the pankriss all those things ore exascerbating it got it o enter met foremen first line drug most of the drug every drug you give a person wit type to dibetes is trying to address part of this chain some of the drugs tell you to make more insolent that is that is one of the strategies here are drugs sulphonioreas they tell the body make more insolen other drugs insolent just give you more of the insolent thing met foremen tackles the problem elsewhere it tamps down glucos by addressing the glucofs disp the a hypatic lucofs outwet channel gel pee one agonists or another drug they increase insolent sensitivity initially causing you to also make more insolen i'm jeulous o tet tozemtic yes ye and ber is it true that berberine is more or less the poor man's met forman ye yots it from a tree barkit just happens to have these same properties of y y the wa rent you ing am tor and reducing the blood bluecosts yend met forman by the way occurs from a lilac plant in france that is whre it was discovered it is also metforeman is also based on a substance found in nature you you need a prescription for met foreman you do not need a prescription for berberi but yet we can talk about berbri olll the later i had couple great experiences with berberine and a couple of bad experiences interesting berbery ye im may be taking one step back from this in two thousand eleven i became very interested in met foreman personally just reading about it absessing over it and just somehow decided i should be taking this i actually began taking metforeman i still remember exactly when i started i started it in may of two thousand eleven and i realize that because i was on a trip with a bunch of buddies we went to the berkshire hathaway a shareholder meeting which is a the buffet a shaireholder meeting and a you now wou's cone a fun thing to do and i remember being sick the whole time because i did not titraight up the dose of met foreman i just went straight to two grahams a day which has kond f the full dose and we went to the sat characteristic of your approach to things yes i think that is safe to say ni sim i'll give you the thirmnists of this due that i collect in the moral en i remember being sick that the whole time we were in ne braska i omahi guess i could not we went to dairy queen caus you do all the buffit things when you are there right i could not have an ice cream a dairy queen you could not man i could not nocious elkaus i would say if you got tat foreman in your system yofe in a bufford lucos you get afor ice creeme considy i was if i could not wen i could not keep anything dow i mean it was his own ati clearly metforeman has this side effect initially which is a little bit of appetite suppression but regardless that is the story on met foreman there there are lot of reasons i was interested in it a i was not thinking true gero protection that term was not in my vernacular at the time but what i was thinking is hay this i con't help you buffor glucos better it is got to be better and this was sort of my first fore into self experimentation you wanted to fine gero protection yea you good torn to the geer geriatric gero ye the a gero from from geriatric old protections protection from aging and when we talk about a drug met foreman or rapamison or even an a d and ar these things the idea is were talking about them is gero protective to signal that they are drugs that are not targeting a specific disease of aging for example a piecias canine inhibiter is sort of gero protective but it is targeting one specific pathway which is tardiovascular disease and dislopodemia whereas the idea is a gero protective agent would target hallmarks of aging there are nine hallmarks of agent pleased do not ask me to recite them i've never been able to get all nine straight but people know what we are talking about right decreased atophagy increase synessens decreased neutrian sensing or defective neutriansensing a prodiomic instability genomic instability a methelation all of these things epugent echanges those are all the nine o marks of e and seven eh a gro protective agent would target those deep down biologic hallmarks of aging and in two thousand fourteen a a paper came out by banister that basically got the world focused on this problem by the world i mean the world of of antiaging what what banister and colleagues did was they took a registry from the uche and they got a set of patience who were on met foreman wuth tht to dibedes but only met foreman these w e're people who had just progress to diabedes they were not put on any other drug just met foreman and then they found from the same registry a group of matched control this is a standard way that epidemiologic studies are done because again you do not have the luxury of doing the randomization you are trying to account for all the biaces that could exist by saying we are going to take people who a look just that person with diabedes can we match them for age sex su we cannot make status a blood pressure be ami everything we can and then let us look at what happened to them over time now again tis is all happening in the future you are looking into the past it is retrospective in that sense and let me just cannot pull up he the sort of a table here i can cun a walk through and this is not in the paper we talk about bat i think thite's an important background they did something that at the time i did not really notice i did not notice what they did i probably did and i forgot but i did not notice this until about five years ago when i went back and looked at the paper and they did something called a a informative censuring the way the study workd is if you were put on met foreman we are going to follow you if you are not on metforman rana follow you and we are ging to track the number of deaths from any cause that occur this is called all cause mortality or a c m and it is really the gold standard in a trial of this nature or a study of this nature or eveng a clenical trial you want to know how much are people dying from anything ase we are trying to prevent or delay death of all causes informitive censuring says if a person whose on met foremen deviates from that inclusion criteria we will not count them in the final assessment how are the ways that that can happen while one the person can be lost to follow up to they can just stop taking their at forman three and more commonly they can progress to needing a more a significant drug all of those patients were excluded from the study think about that for a moment this is in my opinion a significant limitation of this study because what your basic ly doing is saying we are only going to consider the patients who we are on met forman stayed on met forman and never progressed through it and we are ging to compare those to people who were not having typed to diobedi an analogy here would be imagine we are going to do a study of two groups that we think are almost identical one of them are smokers and the other are identical in every way but their not smokers and we are gon to follow them to see which ones get long cancer but every time somebody dies in the smoking group we stopp counting them when you get to the end you are going to have a less significant view of the health status of that group with that caviat the banister study found a very interesting result which was the crude death rate am was and by the way the way these are done this is also one of the challenges of epidemiologyis the math gets much more complicated you have to normalized death rate for the amount of time you study the people everything is normalized to thousand person years the crude death rate in the group of people with type to diobedes who were on met forman including the censering was fourteen point for fourteen point for deaths occurred per thousand patient ears if you looked at the control group it was fifteen point to this was a startling result and i remember reading this in again two thousand fourteen and being holy crat this is really amazing is there a could you explain why cas a a i here those numbers than they do not seem that striking it is the difference of about a year and a half now of cou rst a difference of about a year and half an life atman is is well ai r more nactaly it does not even translate to that soting a step back diabtyeto diabedes on average will shorten your life by six years i say that is the actuarial difference between having typtodibedes and not all commers but you are rigt thits is not a huge difference it is only a difference of the little less than one year of life per thousand patient years studied bthered by the way a pear to point out my my malf was wrong when i d y year and half but but the the point here is you would expect the people in the met foreman group to have a far worse outcome i e to have a far worse crude death rate and the fact that it was statistically significant in the other direction and it turned out on what is called a cox's proportional hazard which is where you actually model the difference in lifespand the people who took met foreman and had diabedes had a fifteen per cent one five fifteen per cent relative reduction in all cause death over two point eight years which was the median duration tof follow up ll that thons o not the number that makes me go woll ye right that a because because you repeat those numbers yen yet fifteen per cent reduction in all caused mortality over two pointat years s bigdeal it is and again there is no clear explanation for it unless you believe that met foreman is doing something beyond helping you lower blood glucos because the difference in blood glucos between these two people was still in favor of the non diabetics again the proponence of met foreman being a jero protective agent and i put myself in this category at one point i would put myself to day in the category of undecided but at the time i very much believed this was a very good suggestion that met foreman was doing other things you me ntioned a couple already mat foreman is a week an hibiter of em tour mat foreman produces inflammation mat foreman potentially tamps down on sonestent cells and their secretory products there are lots of things met foreman could be doing that are off target and it might be that those things are confirming the advantage as many of i've been taking a g one daily since two thousand twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the pod cast a g one is a vitemen mineral probiotic drink that is designed to me all of your foundational nutrition needs of course i try to get enough servings of vitemens and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day but oftentimes i simply cannot get enough servings but with a g one i'm sure to get enough vitements and minerals and the probiotics that i need and it also contains adaptagens to help buffer stress simply put i always feel better when i take g one i have more focus and energy and i sleep better and it also happens to tate sgrighte for all these reasons whenever i'm asked if you could take just one supplement what would it be i answer a g one if you would to try a g one they will to drink a g one dot calm slash hubermen to claim a special offer hey'll give you five free travel packs pluss a year supply of vitem in d three k to again that is drink a g one dot calm slash hubermen cast forward until a year ago and i think most people took the banaster study as count of the best evidence we have for the benefits of met foreman and i'm sure you had lots of people come up to you and ask you should i be on met foreman should i be on met formanmin i probably gout asked that question almost as much as i'm asked any question outside of do i mean people definally o nough you should be consuming you but but after that it is met for resh off the leaves has to be while veeling morning sunlife soso let us let us kind of fast forward to now that the paper that i wanted to spend a few more minutes on and thanks for that background i i'm still i dazzled by the ainsertion of the straw by way of of insolent i i i only have heard that described i needs i i need to go get a better textbook it is a pretty short straw in terne younowits just it' just a little you av just i just a to give people sense to wyum said dazzle by i am always fascinated by how quickly how efficiently and aum how specifically biology can create these little proacing complexes that do something really important an you are talkin about an ondemand creation ofof a portal right oing t these are cells engineering their own machinery and real time an response to chemical siin les remind is it that is it is great yet the think but i'm i'm sure of rusty on my narrow science but an action potential works in reverse the same way you need the t p gradient to restore the a to restore the gradient but once the action potential fires its passive outside right yes o what pears referring to is am the way that nurons become electrically active as by the flow of ions across the sep that from the outside the cellty inside the cell and if we have both active conductances mean their trigger by electric changes in the gradiance it by a changes an electrical potential am and then thei're passi gradience for things can just flow back and forth until thereis a balance equal ut inside an outside the cell i think what is am what is different is that there is oe movement of a lot of stuff inside of nurons when nuro transmitters dopening bines to its receptor and then a bunch of it is a bucket brigade that gets kicked off internally but it is not often that hereabout receptors getting inserted into sairy you winn normally lat they go through a process of a transcribing cenes and making sure that the specific protines are made and then it does are long slow things tot take place over the course of many hours or days whet you are talking about as a real on demand insertion aaoma channel and it make sense as to wy that would a be required what its just o very cool cool kesk and colligs came along and said we would to redo the entire banister analysis am and i think the remotivation for it was the interest in this top ic is through the roof there is a clinical trial called the tame trial that is i think pretty much funded now and may be getting under way soon the tame trial which is an important trial is going to try to ask this question prospectively and through random assignment this is the targeting aging with tat forman trial correct near barsali a is probably the senior p i on that a and i think in many ways the bannister study along with some other studies a but of lesser significance probably provided some of the motivation for the tame trial they said ok le look were ging to do this we are goin to use a different cohort of people the first study that we just talked about the banister study used a i believe it was roughly they sampled ninety five thousand subjects from a u k bio bank here they used a larger sample they did about half a million people sampled from a a a danish health registry and they did something pretty elegant they created two groups to study the first was just a standard replication of what banister did which a was just a group of people with and without diabatic that they tried to match as perfectly as possible but then they did a second analysis in parallel with discordant twins same sec twins that only differed in that one had diabeties and one did not i thogh this was very elegant because here you have a degree of genetic similarity and you have similar environmental a a factors during childhood that might give you you doft allow you to see if the is any sort of difference in signal now turning this back into a littlelit of a journal club virtually any clinical paper you are ging to read table one is the characteristics of the people in the study you always wone to take a look at that when i look at table one here you can see its and by the way just for people watching this we aregng to make all these papers and figures available if youre do not don' we will have nice show notes that ill make all this clear table one in the keys paper shows the baseline characteristics and again it is almost always can be the first table in a paper use see the first figure in the paper is a study design it is usually a flo chart that says these are the inclusion criteria these ar all people that got excluded this is how we randomized et cetera and you can see here that there are four columns that the first two are the singletons these are people who were not related and then the second two are the twins who were matched and you can see remember how i said they sampled about five hundred thousand people you can see the numbers they got seven thousand eight hundred forty two singletons on met foremen the same number then they pulled out matched without diabetes on the twins they get nine hundred and seventy six on met foreman with diabetes and then by definition nine hundred and seventy six co twins without them and you look at all these characteristics what was their age upon entry how many were men what was the year of indexing when we got them what medications were they on what was their highest level of education merital status et cetera the one thing i want to call out here that really cannot be matched in a study this this is a very important limitation is the medication look at look at that column andrew notice how pretty much everything else is perfectly matched until you get to the medication list that is all of eplace ye just you it is not even clothes they are notwhere they are nowhere near matched right another weare just to give you couple of examples on the and let us just talk about the singletons could especally the same story on the twins if you look at what fraction of the people would type to diabetes are on lipid lowering medication it is forty five point six per cent verses fifteen point four per cent in the matched without diabedes it is a three ex differents what about antiplatelets therabe that is thirty per cent verses fourteen per cent anty high pertensive sixty five per cent fir sixty thee per cent verse is thirty one percebecause people w h o have one health as you and oure taking that foreman are likely to have other healthish exact cly this is again a fundamental flaw of epidemiology you can never remove aw the confounders e thi s wy became an experimental scientists yets that we could control variables that is right because without random assignment you cannot control every variable now you will see in a moment when we get into the analysis they go through three levels of corrections but they can never correct this medication one ojust keep them tho back your mind oke the two big things that were done in this experiment or in this survey study to differentiate it from banister was one the twin trick which i think is pretty cool the second thing that they did was they did a sensitivity analysis with and without in formative censuring on of the things they wanted to know us hey does it really matter if we do not count the met form an patients who progress a let us see count of what what transcribed the next figure figure to upon me the next table table too walks you through the crude a mortality rate in each of the groups the most important row i think in this table is the one that says crude mortality per thousand person years now yuyou recall that in the previous study in the bannisters study those were on the ball park of about fifteen pur oke let us look at each of these in the am single the singletons with without the non twins who were not diabetic it was sixteen point eight six can you put a little more contour on what this thousand person years what what it is i tie m up pooling the lifespands of a of of a bunch of different people until you get to the number one thousand ya because you are normalizing not it is not who is get a lov a thousand years cause of e expecting that am youre sensially take to se you have got some people that are en to live om seventy six years fifty two years ninety one years and you are pooling all of those until you hit a thousand and then that becomes kind of a a a ad it is a normalized division you are basely likes to let us ay the the control group o asking if there were a thousand person years available to live how likely is it that this person would live another yes o couple ways to thik aboutsimp taking a step back we always have to have some way of normalizing when we talk about the mortality from a disease cancer in the population we would we recort it as what is the mortality rate pur and it is typically per hundred thousand persons that is a much more intuitive way to express it it is but the reason we can do it that way is because we are literally looking at how many people died this calender year and we divide it by the number of people in that age group i's typically what you are doing when you look at aged groups in buckets of decades that is why we can say the highest mortality is people ninety and up even though the absolute number of deaths is small it is because there is not that many people there rit the majority of deaths in absolute terms probably occur in the seventh decade but as you go up because the denominator is shrinking you have to normal lives to its we just normalized to the number of people here are all the people that started the year here all people that ended the year what is the deathry why are these done in a slightly more complicated way because we we we do not follow these people for their whole lives were only following them for a period of observation in this case roughly three years to say something we have a crude death rate of five deaths per thousand persin years one way to think about that is if you had a thousand people and you followed them for one year you would expect five to die if you had five hundred people and you followed them for two years you expect five to die if you have a thousand people and you follow them for one year you expect five to die those would all be considered equivalent mortalities great thank you for glotnow o this this stuff is i mean i find i find epidemiology when you get in the weeds is whay more complicated than following the basix of a experimental stuff where you just you get to push all the stuff into the garbagemen and just say where to take this number of people or an exclude this group organarandomize ignosee what happens yethat is the paper will tog about now when you a just for age and they do not show it in this table it is only in the text when you a just for age a very important check to do is what is the crude death rate of the people on met foreman who are not twins verses who are twins now in this table they look different because it is twenty four point nine three for the met forman group and twenty one point six eight for the twin group in that is on met foreman when you a just for age they arealmost identical it is it goes from twenty nine point twenty four point nine three to twenty four point seven one other point i'll make here for people who are goingto be looking at this table is a you will notice there are parentheses after every one of these numbers what is that what is that offer in there those parentheses are offering the ninety five per cent confident interval for example to take the number twenty four point nine three is the crude death rate of how many people are dying who take metforeman what it is telling you is we are ninety five per cent confident that the actual number is between twenty three point to three and twenty six point six for if a ninety five per cent confidence interval does not cross the number zero it is statistically significant oso the first thing that just jumps out at you i think when you look at this is there is cl early a difference here between the people who have diobedies and those who do not it complicates the study a little because it is basically two studies in one but you are comparing a ninety five per me a twenty four point nine three to sixteen point eight six t which by the way remains after age adjustment when you go to the twin group it is twenty four point seven three to twelve point nine for maybe just assume out for that what you are describing if i understand correctly is this a crude deaths per one thousand person years let us jus talk by the singletons the on des is sixteen point eight six o sixteen point eight six people die and some people prithing how can point eight six of a person die while it is not always ful numbers but there is there is a bad joke to be made here but i just call it seventeen verth is twenty five r seventeen deaths per thousand verses twenty five deaths yand the twenty five is in the folks that took at foreman now that to the naive listener and me means oh you'l met forman basicly kills you i a not a faster or you are more likely to die but we have to remember that these people have another they have a major health issue that the other group does not have hit is right because people were not a signed drug or not a sign drug it was not plecebo drug it is let us look at people taking this drug for a bad health issue and compare to everyone else that is right now you have to go into and and i'll just sort of skip the next figure but the next figure is a caplin myer curve ii think it isectoly worth locnatic cause they show up in all sorts of studie you look at figure one it is a caplin myere curve which is a mortality curve you will see these in any study that is looking at death and this can be prospective randomized this can be retrospective but these are always going to show up and i think it is really worth understandingwht a caplin myere curve shows you wen the exact is is always time and on the wiaxis is always the cumulative survival it is a curve that always goes from zero to one one or one hundred per cent and it is always decreasing monatonically meaning it can only go down or stay flat it can never go back up that is what a cumulative a mortality curve looks and now we are looking at starting at alive and you arelooking how many people die for every year that passes that is right and in each curve there is one on the left which is the matched singletons and there is one on the right which are the discordant twins you have two lines you have those that were on metforeman with type to diabetes and you have their matched controls in this figure the matched controls are the darker lines and the people with typetodiabdes on metforemant that is the lighter line you will also notice and i the way they have done it here they have got shading around each one we should mention for those that are just listening that in both of these grafts the am downward trending line from the controls gen nondiabetic not taking met foremen is a bulve the line a corresponding to the diabetics who are taking met foremen om put crudely om the people who are taking that forman tho have diabedes are dying at a faster rate for every single year examine the two lines do not overlaph except at the beginning when everyone is alive it is a foot race where basy thof people with met foremen and diabedes are falling behind and dying as they fall that is right and i'm glad you brought up a good point it is not uncommon in treatments a to see capan mire curve's cross they do not have to it is not a requirement that they never cross it is only a a requirement that their monatonically decreasing or staying flat i've seen cancer treatment drugs where they have two drugs going head to head in a cancer treatment and one starts out looking really really bad but then all of a sudden it kind of flattens while the other one goes bad and then it actually crosses and goes underneath but that is not the case here ts to your point the people with dibeties taking met foreman in both the match singletons and the discordance are dropping much faster and they always stay below and i bus jus gon to say that the shading is just showing you in ninety five per cent confidence interval you are just putting basically eror bars along this if this were experimental data if you were doing an experiment with a group of mice and you were watching their survival and you ere what you you would have error bars on this which youare actually measuring this is because you have much more day to hear you are just showing this in this fashion for those that haven a been familiar as to statistics no problem a aerabars correspon to ive you r just in a measure the heights of of a roomful of tenth graters you there is gong to be arranged why you have the very tall kid and the an the very a shorter kid and youan the short kid and the medium ken and there is arranged thre's can be an average a mean and then they will be standard deviations and standard errors and am i these confidence intervals just get give a sense of how much range of some people am die di early some people die late within a given year there can o be different ages a it these aerabars can account for a lot of different forms of veryability here you seling about the veryability is how many people in each group die we are not tracking one diabetic takin met formen verses i'm a control i i should have asked us earlier but i'm well and it is also a mathematical model at this point to that smoothing it out has notice its running for the full eight years even though they are only following people for typically i think the medium was three or four years at a time they are using this quite complicated type of mathematics called a cock's proportional hazard which is what generates hazard ratioes and basically any model has to have some error in it and they are basically saing this is the ai rer you could argue when you look at that figure we do not know exactly where the line is and there but we know it is in that shaded area it my if that sort it make one other point if those shaded areas overlapped you could not really make the conclusion you would not know for sure that one is different from the other yet that is i shad good opportunity to to a raise a common myth which is a lot of people when they look at a paper wet say it is a bargraph and they see these arabars and they will say people often think oh if the arabars overlap it is not a significant difference but if the arabars do not overlap beaning there is enough separation than that is a real and meaningful difference and that is not always the case it depends a lot on that form of the experiment i often see some of it the more robuss twitter battles over how people are reading grafts and i think it is important remember that you run the statistics aholpuly the correcstatistics for the for the sample u but determining significance whether not that the result could be due to something other than chance of course your confidence in that increases as it becomes typically p values pe less an point zeraszers er to one per cent chance that it is do chance rites o very low probably p lessin point or five tence to be the kind of gold standard cut off but when your time about data these which are repeated measures over time people are dropping out literally overtime you are saying they have modeled it to make predictions as to what would happen we are not nesarely looking et you would rad data point yat the rad data was in the previous table that is now taken and run through this cox' model and it is smooth dout on it and to your point about the bargraphs yy i think the other thing you always want to understand is just because something does not achieve thetistical significance the only way you can say it is not significant as you have to know what it was power rd to detect em in statistical power is a a very important concept that probly does not get discussed enough but before you do in experiment you have to have an expectation of what you believe the difference is between the groups and you have to determine the number of samples you will need to assess whether or not that difference is there or not you use something it is 's caled a power table and you you would go to the power table of you if you are doing treatment averse is treatment be and you say well i think treatment a is going to have a fifty per cent response and i think treatment be will have a sixty five per cent response you literally go to a power table that says fifty per cent response fifteen per cent difference that gives you a place on the grid and i want to be ninety per cent sure that i 'm right ninety per cent power i'm being a little bits tos can be a thatisition listening to this who is going to on to kill me but this is directionally the way we would describe it and that tells you this is how many animals or people you would need in this study you are in a need a hundred and forty seven in each group and by the way if you now do the experiment with a hundred and forty seven and you fail to find significance you can comfortably say there is no statistical difference at least up to that fifteen per cent there may be a difference at ten per cent but you were not powered to look at ten per cent and o very important point that you are making another point is just a more general one about stetistic in general the way to reduce variability in a dat a set is to increase sample size then can make sents right if fyou if i just walk into a tenth great glassing lminit measure height a i lit up by the first three kids that i see and i happen to look over there an it is the three that all plan the volley balls together i my sample size is small and i'm likely to get a skew to reper sentation in this case taller than average increasing sample size tends to decrease variation seldom that is why when you herabout a study from the uca biobank or from a half a million danish citizens for instance in this study that is those are enormous sample sizes even though this is a not an experimental study its in epidemialogical observational study a theire's tremendeust power by way of the enormoust number of subjects an that the way that epidemeology will make up for its deffasit you could never do arandomize esignment study on half a million people a you de in it epidimiology makes up for its biggest limitation which is it can never compensate for inherent biases by saying we can do infinite duration if we want we could we could survey people over the course of their lives and we can have the biggest sample size possible cause this is relatively cheap the cost of actually doing in experiment where you have tens of thousands of people as prohibitive and if you look at the woman's health initiative which was a five years study on i do not know what was at fifty thousand women a man that was a billion dollar study this is this is the balancing act between epidemeology and randomize prospective experiments and they they both offer something but you just have to know the blind spots of each one i to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponce ar inside tracker inside tractrs a personalized nutritian platform that analyzes data from your blood endiane to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health gulls i'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your mediate and long turm health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test however with a lot of blood tusts out there you get information back about blood lippits about hormones and on but you do not know what to do with that information with inside trackor they have a personalized platform that makes it very easy to understand your data that is to understand what those lipids with those hormon levels at cetera mean and behavioural supplement nutritian andother protocals to adjust those numbers to bring t em into the ranges that are ideal for your immediate and long term health inside tracker's ultimate plan now includes measures of both apo b and of insolent which are key indicators of carty of ascular health and energy regulation if you a try inside tracker you can visit inside trackr dot calm slash hubermen to get twenty per cent off any of inside trackers plans again that is inside tracker dot calm slash hubermen to get twenty per cent off let us just cun a wrap this up i mean i think less just go to table for which i think it is the most important table a in in here which now lays out the that the final results in terms of the hazard ratioes this is this is the way we want a really be thinking about this again hazard ratios a these are important things to understand a hazard ratio is in number and you always subtract one from the hazard ratio and that tells you if it is a positive number if it is a number i sort of it is number greatr than one you subtract one and that tells you the relative harm if the hazardratios one point five you subtract one point five is a fifty per cent increase in risk a if the number is negative you may recall on the banisterd paper the hazard ratios point eight five ihen it is nesthnt what that means it is a fifteen per cent reduction in relative risk and here you can see all the hazard ratioes are positive what it is telling you here is and i want a walk through this cause its there is a lot of information packed here you have got singletons you have got twins the're showing you three different ways that they do it they do an unadjusted model if you just look at the singletons with and without met foreman and you make no adjustments the hazard ratio is one point for eight meaning the people on met foreman had a forty eight per cent greater chance of dying in any given year then they are non diabetic counterpart the only reason of smiling its not cause i enjoy people dying quite a quite to the contrary is that am this is novel fror me that ive redsim ofdemeological studies before but its not normally where i spend it the majority of my time but up until now i was singing o gape people taking that foreman are are dying more than those that are an i just and i them just relieve to know that i was not am looking all this backwards e they are dying more but of course we do not have a group that is taking that foreman who does not have diabedes and we do not have a group am who ot has diabedes and a is taking that form and pluss something else again whet were only dealing with these constrained yet now there is of others arm to this study that i'm not getting into cause it adds more complexity which is they also have another group that is got diabedes takes hmat forman and take sulphoni oreas which is er a bigger drug and those people die even more woh which again thetveeks to the point right the more you need these medications they are never able to erace the effect of diabedes but in this case it seems that they might be accelerating possibly accelerating death du te diabedes possiblewe we could never know that from this because we are we do not see we would need to see diabatics who do not take that foreman who take nothing and i would bet that they would do even worse my intuition is that the met forman is helping but not helping nearly as much as we thought before my point is they make another set of adjustments they say oce will look in the first one in the unadjusted model we only matched for age and gender that is pretty crude what if we adjust for the medications they are on the cardiof ascular psycatric pulminary to mention meds and merital status i oft know why they through maritale status in there but they did o kno may be being married or unmarried i'm sure aly andbit jus hak's a random thing to throw in with all their meds i would have personally done that adjustment higher up but nevertheless if you do that all of a sudden the a hazard ratio drops from one point for eight to one point three two which means yet you still have a thirty two per cent greater chance of dying in any given year all right what if we also adjust for the highest level of a education along with any of the other covariaus while it does not really change it at all it ends up at one point three three or a thirty three per cent chance increase in dete always knew that more school esng in a saveme was it is not to injack now let us do it for the twins if you do the twin study which you could argue is a slightly purer study because you at least have one genetic an environmental thing that you have attached the unadjusted model is brutal two point one five that is a hundred and fifteen per cent think about this these are twins who in theory are the same in every way except one has diabeties in one dozen and that one with dibetes un met foreman still has a hundred and fifteen per cent greater chance of dying than the non diabetic coat twin when you make that first adjustment of all the meds and merital status i you bring it down to a seventy per cent increase in risk and when you throw education in it goes up to an eighty per cent chance of risk now they did this really cool thing which was they did the analysis on withan without censoring everything i just said here was based on no censoring tell me about censor censoring is when you stop counting the met forman people who have die oso in the singleton group when you unadjust it and the reason i'm doing the unadjusted is that is where they did the censitivity analysis i do not think it really matters that much it is youust have to draw line in the sanc somewhere you will recall that that was a forty eight per cent chance of increased mortality all cause mortality if you stop counting if you if you upon me if you do not censor meaning if you include everybody including when people on met foreman with dibete's die if you censor them it comes down to one point three nine in other words this a very important finding it did not undo the benefits that we sawh in the banister study banister saw a fifteen per cent reduction in mortality when they censored when keys censored it got better but not that much better it went from forty eight to thirty nine per cent in the twins it went from a hundred and fifteen per cent down to only ninety seven per cent in some ways this presents a little bit of an enigma because it is not entirely clear to me having read these papers many times exactly why bannister found such an outloned it such a different response there is another earth there is another technical detail of this paper which is they you can see on the right side of table for they did something called anested case control but you will see and i was going to going to a long explanation of what nested case controls are it is another pretty elegant way to do case control studies where you sample by year and you you you sort of normal lot you you do not count all the cases at the end you count them one by one i do not think it is worth getting in to and ecause it does not change the answer you can see it changes it just slightly but it does not change the point the point here is the keyspaper makes it unundeniably clear that in that population there was no advantage offered by met foreman that undid the disadvantage of having type to diabedes this does not mean that met foreman was not helping them because we do not know what these people would have been without met foreman it could be that this bought them a fifty per cent reduction in relative mortality to where they would been but what it says is in ma way this is what you would ave expected this is what you would have expected ten years ago before the banister paper came out or maybe even before met foreman was used because in some ways it saying what is the likelihood that sick people who are on a lautomedication are going to die compared to not sick people who are not on a lon omedication you one of it is not quite that simple in the in the sense that as you said there are ways to trying isolate met foreman contribution somewhat yim because they are on a bunch of other meds and presumally that was done an analyzed in in other figures where they they consort of tryn they can never attach the results specifically to that foreman right but am there must be some way of waiting tha percentage thetter on psychiatric meds or not on psychiatric medzas some way to teas out whether not there is actually some contribution a met foreman to this result well that is what they are doing in in be in the n the partial adjustment is their actually can theyre actually doing their best to say all right marrage ore not mary the're going very lolirary drug by drug all the way through high blood pressure non high blood pressure smoking non smoking et cetera right in the way they would do that presumely is by saying o cane mari not marry that' sat that is a simple one u are you on lipid lowering meds yes or no oc you are not you are not they and then comparing those cripya ces and note no difference is jumping out that can be purely explained by these other various yes although again this is this a great opportunity to talk about why no matter how slick you are no mattew slick your model as you cannot control for everything there is a reason that to my knowledge virtually every study that compares meat eaters to non meat eaters finds an advantage amongst the non meat eaters and we can talk about all i aspan advanc yes an we can er disease incidents o studies and yet might be tempting to say what their fore eating meat is bad until you realize that it takes a lot of work to not eat meat that is a very very significant decision that a person for most people has a very significant decision a person makes and for a person to make that decision they probably have a very high conviction about the benefit of tat to their health and it is probably the case that that thei'r making other changes with respect to their health as well that are a little more difficult to measure another's a million other problems with thati picked a silly example because the whole meat discussion then gets in to well when when we say eating meat what do we mean wy n as i can is a delly me bers's gray there wera we know it dear that you hunted with your ball e ratli how do we get into all the things but my point is it is very difficult to quantify some of the intangible differences and i think that even a study that goes to great lengths as this one does epidemiologically to make these corrections can never make the corrections and for me the big take away of this study is one this makes much more sense to mee than the banister paper which never really made sense to me and again i was first critical of the banister paper in two thousand eighteen about four years after comment that is about the time i stoppe taking at foreman by the way i stopped taking it for a iferent reason which we can talk about in a sect but a that was the first time i went back and said wait a minute this information thi s is conformative censuring thing is that is a litle fishy and i think we were not looking at a true group of real type to diabatics now that is said maybe it does not matter in other words maybe and even even the keys paper does not tell us that met foreman would not be beneficial because it could be that those people if they were on nothing as their matched cohorts were on nothing would have been dying it a hazard ratuo of three and this brought it down to one point five in which case you would say there is some jero protection there it is putting the breaks on this process all of this is to say absent a ranamized control trial we will never know the answer has there been a randamize contro chal not a mat of omage not not when it comes to a hard outcome now there has been why ikee p the interventions testing programme a which is kind of tegold standard for animal a studies which as run out of three labs it is it is an and i age funded program that is run out of three labs they a they basically testmolecules for gero protection a the itepe was the first study that really put rapa mice on the map in two thousand nine that was the studyd tit is fortuitously demonstrated that even when rapa mison was given very very late in life it was given to sixty month old mice it is still a rdered them a fifteen per cent a life span extension has a similar sha been done in humans it is ha imins hard now we cannot really control with rapa mice no a but when the it p studied met foreman it did not succeed the the there have not been that many drugs that have worked in the i t p the itipe is very rigorous right it is a it does not use an imbred strain of mice it is done concurrently in three labs with very large sample sizing and when something works in the i t p it is pretty exciting rapamison has been studied several times it is always worked another one we should talk about it an subsequent time is seventeen alpha estrodiale this continues to work in male mice and it produces comparable effects to rapa mice estrogen does not work in nammailrice mak but this is alpha not bata this is seventeen alpa estrodyle not bata estrodyle which is the estrodile that we all that that is byavailable and always and and i just as a briefaside am think you and i basically agree that a unless it is a problem males retime postpubrity am should try and have their estrogen as high as possible without having negative symtomology because of the importance of estrogen for lebito for brain function tissue bone health bone health bot this idea rushing estrogen and raising testaostron is just silly right there is not alest just leave raising testostrone out of it but many of the approachis to raising testastrone that a pharmiclogic in nature also raise estrogen a lot of people tring push down on estrogen and that is just again unless people are getting a hybrestrogenic effacts onacomastya or other issues is the exact wrong direction ogo you want estrogen a estrogen is a very important hormon for men and women that is a canaga flots in and estrialty two in hibiter also very successful in the i t p but again interestingly rapami a a metforma not metforman has failed in the it p you no longer takein that for mem i stopped five years ago you 're not a diabetic presume ly you are taking i o taking it for jeurope protection to buffer but gluecost you bean an order madly antueally of longer yes exactly and the reason i stopped in this wll b the last thing before we move on wat cause you could not go to the dairy queen at the buffanno finally the nausea went away after a few weeks sir month maybe am but once i got really into lactate testing i noticed how high my lactate was a at rest a resting fast at lactate should be in a healthy person should be below one some whre between point three point six milimole and only when you start to exercise should lactate go up and an two thousand eighteen was when i started blood testing for my zone to previously when i was doing zone to testing i was just going off my power meeter and heartrate but this is when this is after i'd met and you go son milan and i started wanting to use the lactate threshold of two milimole as my as my determinant if where to put my watage on the bike and i'm to in finger pricks before i start and i'm one point six milimole an i'm t how is going on i cannot be one point the ix rand the a flight ostairs up the back of the emparsapa well no that would put me a lot higher grat but but an an annoniting generous to yourf ah no but but but that is when i started dig a little digging and realized oh what this totally make sense if you have a weak mitacondrial taxin what ar you going to do you are gin a shunt more glucos into piruvate and more piruvate into lactate i'm i'm anarobe yet you ned not an ala on fuel source that is right and then my zone two numbers just seem off my lactate could you feel it sarrdan jo did you feel it in your body cause maybe now i'll just briefly describe i took berberi am it i a during the period of maybe somewhere in the two thousand twelve to two thousand fifteen stratch i do not re i whata you taking it for welli tell you i i was and i still am a big fan of tem pherises a slow caror hydram dyet because i liked to me and vegetables and starch as i'manominabore and i found that it worked very quickly got me very lean i could exercise i could think i could sleep all i a lot of my a rasional for following one eating regiment or another what i e is to enjoy myself but also have mental energy it because if i cannot sleep at night i'm not in replenish i wen i i do not replenish hom whn i feel garbage i do not care how leana i am or o i found the slow carb died to be which was in the for hour body to be a very good plan for me was pretty easy you drop some things bread at cetera you do not drink calories i' except after a resistance training session t cetera but one day a week you have this called cheat day and on the cheat day anything goes and i would eat eit crosonts and then i't alternate a sweet stuff and then i go to s and by the end of the day you do not want to look at an anitem of food at all the only modification i made to this slow carb diet for our body thing was the day after the cheat day i would not eat i would just fast and i had no problem doing that because it was just basically well since you said ah what was it anol in'll sleep ye at yon seabrds i did not have that but since you said that i i will not up the anti here but i'l least match or anal seabridge comment by saying i had less just call it profound gastric distress after eating that a next day selac you ant to do as yea dan food out just hydrate and oftentimes to try and get some exercise and what i read was that berberine poor man's metforman could boffer blood glucose and in some ways make me feel less sick when in jasting all these calories and in many cases spiking my my blood sugar and insolen because you are having ice cream in you et cetera and indeed it worked if i took berberine and i do not recall the miligram count and then i ate a twelve doughnuts i felt fine it was as if i had eaten one dounu wa i felt sort of o kain i body and it id felt much much better no a presume because it is buffering the spikes and blodshure i was not crashing in the afternoon nap than that whole thing and wel i remember how much you were taking i tank as couple on your miligrams say soun about rant isi would write a yellow capsl i forget the source but in any case one thing i noticed was that if i took berbering and i did not injest a profound number of carbohydrates very soon afterwards i got brutal headaches i think i was hypod semac i did not measure it but i just felt i had headaches i did not feel good and then i would eat apetza or two and feel fon and i realized that berberine was putting me on this ot a lower blood sugar state that was the logic anyway and it allowed me to eat these cheat foods but when i cycled off of the the foraas i i do not follow the silcarbdiet any more altough i might again at some point when i stoppd doing those cheat days i did not have any reason to take the berberine and i feared that i was not in jesting enough carbohydrates in order to really justify tryin of buffer my blood blucos also my bloodlucostens to be did you rber d you ever try a carbos no what is that a carbos is another glucofs disposal yet's it is ictlia drug that but it works more in the gut and it just prevents glucofs absorbtion a aa carbos is another one of those drugs that actually found a survival benefit in the ie t p and it was a very interesting finding because the the thesis for testing it the ictey piece a very cleverest system anybody can nominate a candidate to be tested then the he another panel over their reviews it and they decide yet this is interesting wogo had not study it when i think david allison nominated a a carbos to be studied the rational was it would be a a chloric restriction memetic because you would literally just fail to absorb i do not kno make up some number rite fifteen tor twenty per cent of your carbo hydrates would not be absorbed and therefore you would the mice would effectively be colorically restricted it wiu as pass the that is right and what happened wa real interesting one the mice lived longer on a carboes but too they did not weigh any less it wha it they lived longer but not through calory restriction that is interest yes and it ttthe speculation is they lived longer because they had lower lucos and lower insolent and i do not want to send us down some rabbit holes here but therere all sorts of interesting ideas about for instance that some forms of demensha might be call type three diabedes a diabedes of the brain and soethings berbering met foremen lowering bluglucosts keetogenic diets et cetera might be beneficial there i there is a lot to explore here and i know you have explored a lot of that on your podcast i've done far less of that but well at least it seems that we know the fallowing things for short one you do not want insolent too high nor too low you do not want bluglucos too high nor too low if the buffering systems for that are disrupted clearly exercise meaning regular exercise is the best way to keep that system in chack but in the absence of that to or i was taken addition to that tool is there any glucos disposal agent tht's what we are talking about here that form in berberine a carboset et cetera that you take on a regular basis because you have that much confidence in it the only one that i take is an estial tu to in hibiter a this is a class of drug that is used by people would type to diabedes but which i do not have but because of my faith in the mechanistic studies of this drug coupled with its results in the ite p coupled with the human trial results the show profound benefit and non diabatics taking it even for hart failure i thnk there is something very special awote the drug affic that was another paper i was thinking about presenting this time if we will do at the next time but do you believe in coloric rerestriction as a way to extend life or you more of the do the right behaviors amand that is covered in your book out live and elsewhere on your podcast am and buffer blood glucose i is do you still obviously you believe in buffering blood glucos in addition tois doing all the right behavior y i think you can uncouple a little bit the buffering a blood glucost from the coloric deficit a i think you can be in a reasonable energy balance and buffer glucost with good slee pygene lots of exercise an just thoughtful eating a without having to go into a calore deficit it is not entirely clear if profound cloric restriction would offer a survival advantage to humans even if it were tolerable to most which it is not right' for most people it is just kind of off the table right if i said andrew you need to eat thirty per cent fewr calories for the rest of your life ali al live thirty per cent feur years ye er not many xenople who are willing to sign up for that is what is kind of a mood point am but the question is do you need to be fasting all the time you need to be doing all of these other things and the answer appears to be outside of using the mis tools to manage energy balance it is not clear right an energy balance probablys plays a greater roll in glucoshomia stasis than a from a nutrition standpoint then the individual constituents of the meal am now tat's not entirely true i can imagine a cenaria where a person could be in negative energy balance eating twicxbars all day and drinking big gulps but i also do not think that is a very sustainable thing to do because if by definition i'm gonto put you in negative energy balance consuming that much crap i'm ging a destroy you you are going to feel miserable you aregon to be starving right ou o can be satiated eating pure garbage and being in coloric defasit you are goin to end up having to go into coloric excess that is why it is interesting thought experiment i doft thik it is very practical experiment for person to be generally satiated and an energy balance the probaly eating about the right stuff but i do not think that the specific mackrows matter as much as i used to think i'm a believer in getting most of my nutrants from unprocessedr minimaly process sources simply because it allows me to the foods i ye and a more of them and i just love to et i i physically enjoy the sensation of chewing that uknolegeusly tucumber slices for heverfon yei that is i mean that is not my only form of fun fortunately a this is an amazing paper a for the simple reason that it provides a wonderful tutorial of the benefits and drawbacks of this type of work and i think it is also wonderful because we hear a lot about met foremen rapamizin and om thes antiaging approach is but was not aware that there was any study of such a large population of people its pepretty interesting yes i think it remains to be seen if and my patience often asked me hatred i be on met foremen an i give them much much much much shorter version of what we just talked about and i say look if the tame study which should answer this question more definitively right this is taking a group of non diabatics and randomizing them to placibo verses met foreman and studying for specific disease outcomes if the tame study ends up demonstrating that there is a gero protective benefit of met foreman i all reconsider everything i think that is nd we just have to i think all walk around with an appopriat degree of humility around what we know an what we do not know but but i would say right now the epidemiology the animal data my own personal experience with its impact on my lactac production an exercise performance we could this a whle othe rapid hole we could go down another time which is the impact on hypertrophe an strength which appears to be attenuated as well by met foreman a i still cribe it to patience all the time if their insolent resistance for short it is still a valuable drug but i do not think of it is a great tool for the person who is insolent sensitive and exercising a lot i cannot help but ask this question do you think there is any longevity benefit to short periods of coloric restriction iyou know for instance i decide to by the ay i have not done this but let us say i were to decide to fast into one meal a day type thing where i'm going to be in a slight coloric depisite five hundred to a thousand calories for a couple of days then go back to eating im the way that i eat before of that short coloric restriction slash fast is the any benefit to it in terms o cell er health can you you a reset the system is there any idea that the the change is the clearing of senicen cells that we here about a tophogy that we ouknow that in the short tirme you can glean a lot of benefits and then go back to to ourregular pattern of eating and then a periodically ina once every couple of weeks or once a month just be on fast for a day or two is thre any benefit to that that is that purely in the domain of longevity not because there is all discipline function there there is a flexibility function n there is polly an insolent sensitivity function but is there any evidence that it can help us live longer think the short answeris no im for two reasons one i do not think that that duration would be sufficient if if one is going to take that approach but to i'm even if you went with something longer what i used to do et i used to do seven days of water only perqarter three days per month i was bet o basely always ito be three day fast three day fast seven day fast just imagine doing that all year rotating rotating running for many years i did that im now i certainly believed and to this day i would say i have no idea if that provided a benefit i but my thesis was i the downside of this is relatively circumscribed whic is profound misery for a few days and a what i did not appreciate the time which i obviously now look back at it realizes muscle mass lost you are just it is very difficult to gain back the muscle cumulatively after all of that loss a but my thought was exactly as you said there is got to be a resetting of the system here this must be sufficiently long enough to trigger all of those systems but you are getting at a bigger problem with gero science which i'm really hoping the epigenetic field comes to the rescue on it has not come close to it to date which is we do not have bio markers around true metrics of aging everything we have to date stinks we are really good at using molecules or interventions for which we have biomarkers rig when you lift waits you can look at how much weight you are lifting you can look at youre decks ascain and see how much muscle mast you'r generating that those are bioe markers those are giving you outputs that say my input is good or my input needs to be modified a when you take a sleep supplement you can look at your eight sleep and go oh my sleep is getting better there is a bio marker a when you take mat foreman when you take rap a mice an when you fast we do not have a bio marker that gives us any insight into whether or not we are moving in the right direction and if we are are we taking enough st do not know i often get asked what is the single most important topic you would want to see more research dollars put to in terms of this space and it is unquestionably this as unsexy as it is who cares about bio markers but without them i do not think we are going to get great answers cause you cannot do most of the experiments you and i would dream up got well i'm grateful that you are sitting across the table or me telling me all this and that i'm everyone can hear this i but again we will put a link to the papers plurel that i peter just described and for those of yeither listening and not watching i'm ofull you ere able to track the the general i'm themes and take aways and im it is fun to go to these papers you se these big stacks of numbers and and it can be a loll it overwhelming but im my a additional suggestion on parsing papers is ounotice that peter said he spend u e's read it several times youunlike a newspaper article or or i a instrgranpost with a paper youre not necessarily going to get it the first time you certainly will not get everything that i i think spending some time with papers for me means reading it and then reading i again a litl bit later or an n tell me where it it youave abat to say what is your cause cause i kind of have a way that i do it but i'm curious as to how you do it of your if you are encountering paperfor the first time what do you have an order in which you to go through thdoo do you want do you read it sequentially or do look at the figures furst how do you ho doyou go through it unless it is an area that i know very very well whet i can skip to some things i'm before reading it the whole way through im my pross is always the same and actually this is fun because i used to teach a class when i was oppressor you see sandiego i'm called nurl circuits and health an disease and it was an evening course that grew very quickly from fifty students to four hundred plufs students and we would do exactly this we wouldnitparse papers and im and i had everyone ask what i calle the four questions im it was not exactly four questions but i have little through by five card next to me or piece of a manap by eleven paper typically and when i sit down with tha paper i want to figure out what is the question they are asking what is the general question what is the specific question and i write down the question then what was the approach you how did they test that question and sometimes hi can get a bit detailed oun get into uniisto cemistry and they did pieciar for this it it is not important a for most people that they understand every method but it is worth while that if you encounter a method piecyar or your chromatography or efhamari that you at least look up on the innernat what it is purposes et that will help a lot and then it was what they found and there you can usually figure out what they believe they found anyway by reading the figure headers rit what are younoll figure one here is the header that typically if it is an experimental paper it will tell you what they want you to think they found and then i tend to one ano the conclusion of the study and then this is really the key one and this is the one that would really distinguish the high performing students from the others ou have to go back at the end and ask whether not the conclusions the major conclusions drawn in the paper are really substantiated by what they found and what they did and that involves somethinking it involls really spending sometime thinking about what what they identified now this is in something that anyone can do straight off the bat as a skill that you develop over time and different papers require different formats but those four questions really form the cornerstone of a of teaching under graduates and i think graduate students as well of how to read a paper and again it is something that can be cultivated and it is still how i approach papers what i do typicallies i'll read title abstract i usually then will skip to the figures and see how much of it i can digest without reading the text and then go back and read the text but in farness journals great journals science natures oftentimes will pack much information the sel press journals to into each figure and it is coded with no definition of the acranyms that almost always i'm into the introduction and results within a couple of minutes wondering what the hell this acranym is of the had acranym is and it is it is just yes just wild how much how much nomanclature there really is i cannot remember was it you or was it ar friend palcanti when he was here im who said that oh no i'm sorry it was neither it was charaboff themologyit stampford a doctor jeffrey golbert who has a guest on the pot casts recently who off camera i think it was told us that if you look at the total number of words and terms that a physician leaving medical school owns in their mind in their vocabulary it is the equivalent two additional full languages of fluency beyond their native language you are try linguell at least out d you speak language other than english poorly o case o you are youyoureat least trilinguell and propably more no one is expected to be able to pars these papers the first time through without substantial training ye ni i i think that is that bit is a great format and you are absolutely right i have a different way that i do it when i'm familiar with the subject matter becas one im not a well again if i'm reading papers that are something that i know really well i can basically glean everything i need to know from the figures a and then sometimes i'll just do a quickskim on methods a but i do not need to read the discussion i do not need to read the entro out any to read anything else ah if it is something that i know less about then i usually do exactly what you say i try to start with the figures i usually end up generating more questions what what what do you mean what what is this how did they do that and then i got to go back and read methods typically and one f theotherthing this prite worth mentioning is a lot of papers these days have supplemental information that are not attached to the paper im you are amazed at how much stuff gets put in the supplemental section and the reason for that of course is that the journals are very a specific on the formad in length of a paper a lot of the times when you are submitting something if you want t put any additional information there it cannot go in the main article it has to go in the supplemental figor even for this paper there were a couple of the numbers i spouted off that i had to pull out of the supplemental paper for example when they did the sensitivity and awisis i'm the i'm censuring verses noncensuring that that was in a supplemental figure that was actually not even in the paper we presented well shwe pivitinge another paper it is a very different sort of paper it is an experimental paper were there is a manipulation i must say i love love love this paper and i do not often say that about papers i'm excited about this paper for many reasons but i want to give a couple of caviats up front first of all the paper is not published yet the only reason i was able to get this papers because it is on byoarchive there is a new trend over the less i woinl say five six years of people posting the papers that they have submitted to journals for pure review on line that people can look at them prior to those papers being pure reviewed there is a strong possibility that the final version of this paper which again we will provide a link to is going to look different maybe even quite a bit different then the one that we are going to discuss none the less there are couple of things tot make me confident in the data that we are about to talk about first of all the group that publish this paper it is really playing in their wheel house this is what they do and they publish a lot of really nice papers in this area im i'm going to mispronounce i'm her first name but i think it is cha see gou at im who is at the econ school of medicine mount signi runs a laboratory theire study addiction in humans and im the first off author of the paper is ofer pearl im this paper is wild and i'll just give you a couple to take aways first as a bit of a hook tofle a entice people to listening further as this is an important paper this paper basically addresses how our beliefs about the drugs we take impacts how they affect us at a real level not just at a subjective level but at a biological level just to back up a little bit i'm a former guest on this pod cast doctor aly crum a whose name is actually a leocrum but she goes by alichrum talked about belief effcts belief effects are different than plusibo of facts pluasibo effects are really just category of facts it is oke i'm going to give you this pill peter and i'min to tell you that this pill is molecule ecs five nine five to and that it is going to make your memory better and then i give you a memory test and your group performs better than the people in the control group who i give a pill to and i say this is just a plusebo or there other variance on this where am people wll get a drug and you tell them at plusebo they will get a plusebo you tell them its drug it is it is a binary thing it is an honor and ofthing you are either in the drug group of the plusebo group and youre either told that ou're getting drugor plusebo and we know that pluasibo offacts exist in fact one of the crueller ones i was never the subject of this but there was a kind of lore in high school that h kids would do this mean thing it is a formablling i really do not it where they get some kid at a party to drink am alcohol fre beer and then that kid would tart acting drunk and than they go gacha does even have alcohol in it now that is a mean joke am and just reminds me of some of the the u the horrors of high school may that is writing govery often which i also do not suggest but no it am it is a mean joke but it speaks to the plusibo of fact right and there is also social contact offact plusibo effects are real am we know this belief effects are different belief effcts are not eirbe the plusebo or non plusebo belief effects have a lot of knowledge to enrich one's belief about a certain something that can shift there psychology and physiology one way or the other and i think the best examples of these really of these belief effects really do come from alicrum slab in the psychology department at stamford although some of this work she did prior to getting to stampered for instance if people are put into a group where they watch a brief vidio just a few minutes of vidio about houstress really limits our performance let' say at archery or at mathematics or at music or at public speaking and then you test them in any of those domains or other domains in a stressful circumstance they perform less well ok and we know they perform less well because we are by virtue of a heightened stress response you can measure heart rayy can measure stroke volume of the heart you can measure a prefer blood flow which goes down when people are stress narrowing a vision et cetera you take a different group of people and randomly assigne them to another group where now the're being told that stress enhance is performance it mobilizes resources it narrows your vision such that you can perform tasks better et ceter et cetera and there performance increases above a control group that receives just useless information heare lease useless as it relates to the task in both cases by the way the roups arebeing told the truth stress can be to pleading or it can enhance performance but this is different than plasibo because now it scaling according to the amount and the type of information that they are getin can you give me a sense of magnitude of benefit or deteriment that one could experience in a situation the oneyou just describe ya it is its striking there opposite in direction the stress gets us worse makes you am let us say i think that if we were to just put a rough percentage on this would be somewhwhere between ten and thirty per cent worse et performance than the control group and stresses enhancing is approximately equivalent improvement there in opposite directions even more striking is the the studies that m allys lab did m and others looking at for instance you give people a milkshake you tell them it is a high calory milkshake has a lot of neu trance and then you measure grellan secretion in the blood and grellan is a marker of hunger that increases longer it is beensince you have eaten and what you knotices that suppresses grellan to a great degree an for a long prative time you ive another group shake you tell em it a localory shake that has got some neutriance in it but that does not much faten t much sugar et cetera they drink the shape less grellants suppression and it is the same shire and it is the same shape and satiety lines up with that also in that study and then the third one which is also pretty striking as they took hotel workers they gave them a short tutorial or not informing them that moving around during the day and vacuming doing all that kind of thing is great healps you lower your be amie which is great for your health you ge you incentivise them and then you let them out into the wild of their every day job you measure their activity levels the two groups do not differ they are doing roughly the same task leaning down cleaning out trash gans et cetera guess what the group that was informed about the health benefits of exercise lose twelve per cent more weight compared to the other group and no difference in actual movement apparently not now how could that be i mean literally this was sparked by inalley's words this was sparked by her graduate adviser saying what if all the effexts of exercise or plucib right language is which is not what any one really believes but is just such a you knot i love that anecdot that alley told us because it just really speaks to how really smart people think they sit back in the goyellic exercise oviuc he has benefits but what if a lot of the benefit that you tell yourself its good for you and the brain can actually activate these these mechanisms in the body and why would not that be the case cause the nervous system extends through both o intreso interested oke fast word to this study which is really about belief effacts not plecibo offacts and to make a long story short we know that nicotine vaped smoked dipped or snuffed wore these los in pouches or taken in capsil form does improve cognant performance i'm not suggesting people run out and start doing any f those things i did whole episode on niotine that delivery device offen will kill you some other way ors bad for you but it causes vasol constriction which is also not good for certain people but nicotine is cognitive endhancing why well you have a couple sises in the brain namely in the basal forbrain nuclys salus in the back of the brain structures locus rulius but also this what is called it is got a funny name the podunculo pontine nucleus which is the nucleus in the in the the ponds in the back of the brain in the brainstem that sends those le acs on wires into the fhalamus the thamus is a gateway for censory information and in the fhalamus the visual information the auditory information it has nicotinic receptors and when the poduncul upontine nucleus releases nicotine or when you ingest nicotine what it does is increases the signal to noise of information coming in through your senses the fidelity of the signal that gets up to your quartax which is your conscious perception of those senses is increased and how much andogenus nicotine to be produce o am well it is going to be a seto colling binding to nicotenic receptor i swe not taking nicora we are not find into this is a this is a nicotinic setal coline receptright of which there are at least seven and probably fourteen subtypes but rit there called nicotinic receptors in an annoying way in the same way that canabinoid receptors are called can abonoid receptors but then everyone thinks oh you nother's receptors are there because werespost to smoke pot or those receptors of their exrspose to in jest nicotine no the drugs that rung ustatautov e receptthat is right very exactly receptor is named after the drug and the importan thing to know is that whether not's bazil forebrain a produncul pontine neucleus or locus rulius that at least in the brain is were not time about muscle where a sedo calling toes something else vya nicotinic receptors there in general just tends to be a signal to noise in hanser and for the non engineering types out there no problem signal te noise just imagine i'm talking right now an ther's lostatic in the background ther two ways for you to be able to hear me more clearly we can reduce the static or i can increase the fidelity the the omvolume and the clarity of what i'm saying am for instance and that is really what a seto calling does that is why when people smoke a cigarette they get that boost of niccotine and they just feel clearer it really works the other thing that happens is the falumus sens information to a couple of places firs walt sends information to the reward centers of the brain the musolymic reward pathway that releases dopaming and typically when nicatine is increased in our system dopamin goes up that is one of the reasons why niccatine has reinforcing we just it it is a we seek it out ave done beautiful experiments with honey beas even where ou put nicatine on certain plants or it comes from certain plants and the will forage there more you get eun of them kind of buzz that was upon tan on a in any event there is also an output from this thing the fhalumus to the ventrimedial prefrontal quartecs which is nare of the forebrain that really allows us to limit our focus in our attention for sake of learning it allows us to pay attention this is the circuit you talked about this in your fantastic podcast on stimulants yon eighty ght ther eighty iht t typically eighty eight e drugs to things at or all viv ants mathamphedamine for that matter am riddlin youre whyit is counterintuitive the stimulan would be a treatment for some one with difficulty focussing yet in young kids who have difficulty focussing if you give them something they love they are a lazer and the reason is that ventrimedial prefuntal quartec circuit can engages when the kid is interested and engaged but kids with eightyhty eight eigh t tend to have a hard time engaging their mind for other types of task and other types of tasks are important for getting through life and it turns out the giving those stimulant drugs in many cases can enhance the function of that circuit and it can strengthen that ideally the kids do not need the drugs in the long runnal the that is not often the way that it plays out and there other ways to get at this there is now a big battle out there its eighty h t real is it not real of course it is real does every kid need eighty h t meds no are there other things nutrition more playtime outside et cetera that can help improve there symptoms without drugs yes is the commination of all those things together known to be most beneficial yes o the dosages given too high and generally should be you kno tigh traded down maybe some kits neel lot some gets ne a litle i probably just gained and lost a few enemies there the point is that these circuits are hard wired circuits throg one other question u if my memories sromscrectly does not nicotin potentially have a comming effectn as well and that seems a bit counter intuitive to the focusing one or h is it a dose effect ratiming effect ow as i er yet it is a dosing effect the interesting thing about niccotine is that it can enhance focus in the brain but in the periphery it actually provide some muscle relaxation sos cuve the perfect drug if you think about it again u it is iwas us reflecting on this how when we were growing up peoplud smoke on plain that smoking section on the plain no people smoked all the time and now hardly anyone smokes for all the obvious reasons but yet it provides that really ideal balance between being alert but being mellow and relaxed in the body am hence it is reinforcing properties loka this study is remarkable because what they did is they had people come into the laboratory they gave them a vape pen these are these are smokers these are experienced smokers typially there is a wash out before they come in they are not smoking for a bit they can clear their system of nicotine and they measure wong as that u typically it is a couple of days o cya which must be asablo dos i you n us an thes cannot have nicker at gome or anything thow nothing they must be dying and i wonder how many cheat but they they can measure they measure an oxide or they measure carbonoxin their measuring nicotine in the blood is well they do a good job there then what they do is they have them vape and their vaping either a low medium or hidose of nicotine the dosages do not really matter because tolerance varies et cetera and then they putting them into a functional magnetic resinence in maging machine of where they can look at it is really blood flow is really humo dynamic response for those o you want to know it is the oxy is the ratio of the oxygenade to deoxygenated blood because when blood blood will flow to nerants that ar active to give it oxygen and then it is deoxygenated and then there is ae change in what is called the bold signal efam ari when you see these hot spots in the brain is really just looking at blood flow and then there is some interesting physic saround and i'll pryt get this rong but i'll take an attempt at it tat i get beat up ioa bit by the physisn enguneors i'm ou rember the right hand rule ranno cas do i have ti striht a correct the rehimeral if you put your thumb out with your first with your indix fingering middle fingern your thumb facing up i think that the thumb represents the charge the direction of the charge right and then is not the electromagnetic field is the downward facing figure and then it is tha to have that right i have to loio acto cas wat some one will look it up what what you do is when you put up person's head in this big magnet and then you pulse the magnet what happens is the oxygenate and deoxygenated blood it interacts with the magnetic feel differently and that difference in signal can be detected and you can see that in the form of activated brain area see i mean m ari all works by proton detection presumably there is a difference in the proton signal when you have high oxygen verses low oxen concentration that is right umand what theyll do is the pulse with the magnet because my understanding is that and this is deffly getting beyond my experteise but that the the spin orientation of the protens than it is it is going to relax back at a different rate as well whut by the relaxation at a different rate you can also get not joust resting state activation o look at ae banana what areas of the brain light up you can look at cn conectivity between areas and how one areas driving the activity of another area very very powerful technique what they do is they they put people in the scanner and then you will this as ou what ar the whet e the limitations of of ef amari o in in terms of i mean how fine is the resolution a ma wheare or the blo ing spots of a technache resolution you can get down to sub sentimeter they talk about it always in these paper as a voxles which are these lod a few bic picles things a you't sub subsntimeter but you are not going to get down to millimit there are a number of lconfounds that maybe we will not go into now that have been basically worked out over the last ten years by doing the following you cannot just give somebody a stimulus compared to nothing i'll just tell you the experiment it was discovered for instance that when some one would move their right hand caus eve when you'e in the emari and its onin for one of these recently for clinical not a problem but just for dignostic sand you are leaning back an you and you can move your right hand a bit and they would see an area motor cortects lighting up but what they notice was that the area corresponding in the left hand was also lighting up what you really have to do is you have to look at resting state how much are they lighting up an atyo last ran ands an a tract that out now you will always see resting state verses activation state yet was not there a really funny study gun is a sproof maybe a decade ago that put a dead salmon into an amria machine and did an diy id an femari ave a dead salmon that demonstrated some interesting signal no that woutd but no we gofind this one for the feanes i do not you do one of these wild papers ones there is wthere are papers of people putting do not do the foks putting elephants on eleste that were published in science and things crazy experiments we should offin you a crazy experiments geonel club in any event you can get a sense of which brain areas are active and wen with fairly high spacial resolution fairly high and pretty good temporal resolution on the order of hundreds of mill a seconds not but it is not ultraultra fast because a lot of naral transmissions happening on the yotens of mill a scons i'm especialy when you are in talkngabout auditory processing ok they put people into the scanner and then they they give them a essentially a ta that is design to engage the thalamus knowng to engage the thalamus reward centers and the venturemedial prefuntal quartecs and it is a very simple game youl this cas a you have a background in finance you let people watch a market ca here is the stock market or you could say ere that the price of peas it does not really matter it goes up it goes down andthey are looking a squiggle line than it stops nd then they have the option but they have to pick one option they'r either going to invest a certain number of the hundred units that you have given them or they can short they can say hit isgoing to go down and try to make money on the on the prediction it sgin to go down you could explain shorting better than i could for sure depending whether not they get the prediction right or wrong they get more points are they lose points and they are going to be rewarded in real money at the end of the experiment this is going to engage this type of circuitry now remember these groups were given a vape pen prior to this where they have vaped what they were told is either a low medium or hig dose of nicotin and they do this task the goal is not to get them to perform better on the task the goal is to engage the specific brain areas that irrelevant to this kind of error and reward type circuits and we know that this task does that that includes the thalamus that includes the musolymbic reward pathway and dopamein it includes the ventramedial prefrontal quartex first of all they measure nicotin in the blood they are measuring how much people vaped they were very careful about this when the nice things about the vape pen for the sake of experiment and not recomending people vape but they can measure how much nicotine is left in the vape pen before after they can measure how long they inhaled hellon the held it in hi's lot that you can do that is harder to do with a cigarette oq they measured people's belief as to whether or not they got low medium or high amounts of nicotin and if if they were told they were told they got y that this is a low amount to medium amount or high amount and then of course they looked at brainary activation during this task and what they found was very traight for sorry they were all given the same amount yes that is is tis tis te snik i was skin offer it is a ponciine but that is toke no i think that that the cool thing about this experiment is that the subjects are unaware that they all got the exact same amount of relatively low nicotin containing vape pen that that they basely ender measuring it from their bloodstreams they all have fairly low levels of nicotine but one group was told you got a lot one group was told you got a medium amount and the other was told you got a little bit now a number of things happen but the most interesting things are the following first of all people subjective feeling of being on the drug match is what they were told if they were told hey this is a high amount of nicotine that feels a high amount of nictine and these are experience smokers if it was a medium amount nethat feels a mmedium amount for the low amount they think it was a low amount now that is perhaps not surprising thas you just a shrip truttio and tht's simplisi boaccount but if you look at the activation of the thalamus in the exact regions where you would predict a sedo coling transmission to impact the function of the thalmus of these include areas what is called the centromedium newcleis thevent troposterian nuclas the names that really do not matter but these are errors involved in attention it scales with what they thought they got in the vapepen meaning if you were told that ou got a low amount of nicotin you got a little bit of activation in these areas if you were told that you got a medium amount of nicotin and that is what you vaped that you had medium amounts or moderate amounts of activation and if you were told you got high amounts of nicotin you got a high degree of activation and the performance on the task believe ere not scales with it somewhat keep in mind everyone got the exact same amount of nicotin in reality here the belief effect is not just changing what one subjectively experiences of othes is the effect of high niccotine or low nicotine it act e is changing the way that the brain responds to the belief and that to me is absolutely wild now there re couple of other things that could have confounded this first of all it could have been that if you believe you got a lot of nicotine you are just faster were you are reading the lines better were you are response time to hit the button is quicker i tell you have a drug that is can improve reaction time you might believe that about niccotine and you are quicker on the trigger and you are getting they have a deer activation it is more actavation there could be they rule that out they also rule out the possiler cotabid rule that out by looking at rates of wa of pressing and themres ord of nothing and insensory areas of the brain that would that would represent that kind of difference they do not see that the other thing that is very clear is that the connection between the falmis and the venturamedial prefrontal quartecs that pathway scales in the most beautiful way such that people that were told they had smoked a low or vaped a low amount of nicotine got a subtle actavation of that pathway people that were told that they got a moderate amount of nicetine got a more robust actavation of that pathway and the people that were told that they got a high amount of niccotine in the vape pen saw a very robust actavation of the falmente to this ventual prefrontal cordical pathway now of course this all happening under the hood of the skull simply on the basis of what they were told and what they belief and technically the ef amari is showing the actavation of those two areas and that is how you can infer o you strength of that connection that is right there is a separate method called diffuser tenser imaging which was developed i believe out of the group in minnesota minnesota has a very robust grup interns o narrow imaging that can measure actavation in fibre pathways this is not that but you can look at the timing of actavation and it is unknown what we call monisan aptic pathway we have not talk much about figures here but i gues if we were gin a look at any one figure and i can just describe it for the audience that is not paying a d esn't have the figure in front of them the ah let us see i the the most a li the most important figure is figure too member i said elece to read the titles of figures which is that the belief about nicotine strength induced a dose dependent response in the phalamus basically if you and figure to be can tell you if they believe that they got more nicotine that is athat is essentially the response of t that they saw if you look aorsory panel e feeu loike at the belief rading as a function of the estimate inthalmis of of what how much activation there was it is a it is a mess when you look at all the dots at once but if you just separate it out by high medium in low you run the statistics what you find is that there is a gradual increase but a legitimate one from low to medium to hige in other words if i tell you this is a hihdose of niccotine your brain will react as if it is a highdose of nicotine now what they did not do wasd give people zero nicotine yets about to say there is control tit is missing yal yes what they did not do as give people zero niccotine and then tell them ah this is a high amount of niccotine the sort of the equivalent of the cruel high school experiment you are no alcohol but then that the the kid ac drunk now in the in the high school example it is unclear whether not the kid actually felt drunk or not ahm it is unclear whether not they had been drunk previously if they ven knew what it would be ti feel drunk et ceteran there is the social context what i find just outrageous and outrageously interesting about this study is simply that what we are told about the dose of a drug changes the way that our physiology response to the dose of the drug and in and in my understanding this is the first study to ever look at dose dependence of belief of facts writ to really and why would thout the important wealth for almost every study of drugs you look at a dose dependent curve you look at zero lodose medium dose high dose and here they they clearly are seeing a dose dependent response simply to the understanding of what they expect the drug ought to do in otherwars you can buy pass farmacology somewhat right now look at figure to be at my reading is correctly it is got a four bars on there you have got the group who were told they got a low dose the group who was told they got a medium dose the group that was told they had a hig dose and then these healthy control right who presumably were non smokers who were just put in the machine that is wary tis yet yet this is measuring parameter estimate what is that referring to im they areability play the the the betrading game o the perameter estimate is the is the activation a rewore related activities from independent falmus massrig whet ther doing is their justangle we just look at the falmus what is the level of activation i see this suggests that the only statistical difference was between the low in the high that is right and nobody else was statistically differencer but that is not the whole story no that is not the whole story when you look at the output from the falamus to the ventrimedial prfrontal quartex that is where you starts identify the that figure for a that is yes this is where you see oms o figure for be if you look at prameter estimate this is the degree of activation between the falmus in the ventrimedial prefrontal quartex and it is called the instructed belief you can see that there is a low medium and high scatter of of dots for each and that each one of those is significant is not it interesting that at the falamus which is and you will you will immediately appreciate my stupidity when it comes to narrow science which is more proximate to the nicatinimi pernicatin the nicetonmi whald you call it the niccetin i seidocalling receptor you have a lower difference of signal strength and somehow that got amplified as it made its way forward in the brain yes thats surprise you it is surprising and it surprised them as well the the interpretation they give again this were time i before important it match their conclusions against what they actually faund which is what we are doing here the interpretation that they give is that it does not take much nicatenic receptor occupancy in the falments to activate this pathway but they too were surprise that they could not detect a raw difference in the activation of thalmas but in terms of its output said the prufontal quartex that'men because it is show that figure for b is more convincing than figure too because even figure two e if you read the fine print the are the correlation coffisionists woint two savets we it is not that is strong right it is weak at the thalames it is kind of there might be a signal by the way this goes back to our earlier discussion there could be a huge signal here and we are under powered how many subjects were in this ou would this you would not have a lot of subjects in this experiment yet this it no you it and this just speaks to the general challenge of doing this kind of work it is hard to get a lot of people in and through the scanner in it is a clin sa an invensive ah we have to i should know this but we can dum we can go back to the by tyous can horo just look at the number of dots on herimang it is in the low tens you'r right it is li up forty thirty something that it is not it is possible you do tha ger danis study ye you do this wit a thousand people this could all be statistically significant right it was a they talk about this you will based on this we estimate that an end of twenty en a sample size in each belief condition the final sample would provide ninety percent power to detect an effect of this magnitude at an alfa of point zer azero point five and at two tail am test oi o no that is that is them referring to what we just talked about which is the pow we believe at ninety per cent confidence to get an alfa of point o five which means w one to be ninety five ersent confidence we need sixty people twenty per group but if the difference is smaller than what they expected they will miss out on some of the significance which that looks their missing between the medium nd high group and i too was surprised that am they did not see a difference in the between the medium and the high group a but they did in the output of the thalmus i was also surprised that they did not see a difference this is kind of interesting in its own right if figure three talks about the belief about nicotine strength did not modulate the reward response the dopamin response how was that measured ato dit an i am arie y exactly if you look at figure three be other people cannot see it but basically oh yem what you will see is that there is no difference between these different groups am in terms of the amount of activation in these reward pathways if people got a low medium o high amount of nicotine now that actually could be leverage i believe if somebody were trying to quit niccotine for instance and they were going to do that by progressively reducing the amount of nicotine that they were taking but you told them that it was the same amount what from one day to the next you could wittle it down presumably to a low amount before taking it to zero and if they believed it to be a greater amount than it might actually not a distroppet their reward pathways meaning they would feel am presumably they would feel rewarded by whatever nicetine they were bringing in what would be your prediction if this experiment were repeated but it was done exactly the same way with nonsmokers who well one thing that sort of a interesting you asked about art a petential sources of a artiffact the problems with ot fa mori one of the challenges that they know in the study was yet to stay very still in th in the machine but the subjects were constantly coughing because theyr smokers oh ge pres only the data would be higher fidelity oare chuckling at that one but i i was how to read that one twice and tho themin sense af their smokers are coughing against they still movement artoffact am but in all seriousness i think that for people that are naive to niccotine even a small amount of nicotine is likely to get this pathway actavated to such a great degree the first time of fact of pretty much any drug but i wonder if they would be more or less suceptible to the belief system yew that is a really good question right becuse hey have no prior to compare it to ave no pleasant they have no experience to compare it to with respect to the obviously beneficial effects of nicotine that the smokers are well used to this is thet the poor kid that got duped into thinking the nonile callic beer was and i'll calthough the're actually the winter we know because it did not up n alcall alcalls bad for you in the end that kid winds and the other ones lose poetic justice but i'm that kid having never been actually drunk before presumably why would ill ecarent get moral acceptim mores essentially that is my guests youwel my belie for this experiment is not ere this paper rather is not because i think it is the be ll end all or it is a perfect experiment i just think it very cool that they are starting to explore dost dependence of belief because that has all sorts of implications i mean im use your imagination folks whether not we are talking about im a drug which i you at a behavioural intervention we are taking about a vaxine and i'm not refrained any one specific vaxine i'm just talking vaxnes generally i'm talking about yopsychoactive drugs i'm talking about a'm ellicit drugs i'm talking about antito press ance i'm talking about all the sorts of drugs we are talking about before that formen et cetera just throw our arms round all of it what we believe about the effects of a drug presumably in addition to what we believe about how much we are taking and what those effects ought to be clearly ore impacting at least the way that our brain react to th os dr ya it is very interesting in men when you consider how many drugs that have periferal effects a or preferal outputs begin with central issue again i think the geo p one agonists are such a great example as a ye yem i i do not think anybody fully understands exactly how they are working but it is hard to argue that their impacting that the geol pe one analogue is is having a central impact it is doing something in the brain that is leading to a reduction of appetite and we believe that ye ye id i think the malsetate a point to different areas of the hypothalemus that arelated to society up that that sit is at least possible ye i mean that there is no quicker way to make a mouse overeat er under eat than by leisioning its hypothalemis depending on where you do prisomally these drugs work there but again it speaks to what do you need to believe in order for that to be the case have they done plasibo trarles they are where people get something in they are told oh these doe at i mean of course those drugs have all been tested vioclocebo and the closibo groups do not do anywhere near as well that is how we know that there is activity of the drug but but again there is that is a little bit different than being told you are absolutely getting at right cause in the r c ts you are just told you might be getting it you might not be getting it it is not quite the same as this experiment this experiment is is one level up where youre being told now you are absolutely getting it yu just getting different doses of it yet to take this to maybe the eighty h t realma let us a kid has been on eighdiate se mets for a while in the parents for whatever reason the physician dicide they want to cut back on the dosage but if they were to tell the kit its the same dosage they have always been taking in it had a certain positive effect for them according to the results at least in this paper i which are not definative but are interesting the lower doses may be as effective simply on the basis of belief and and this is a part that makes it cool to me is that and it is not a kid tricking themselves of the parents tricking the kid much as the brain activation is corresponding to the belief right that is where this in arthris why because it is done in the brain i think we can am it gets totes kind of abstract a nearly mystical but not quite mystical aspects of belief effects which is that your brain is a prediction making machine it is a a datare interpretation machine but it is clearer that one of the more importan pieces of data are your beliefs about how these things impact you a it is not that this by passes physiology people are not deluding themselves thet thealamus is behaving as if it is a high dose when it is the same dose as the lodose croup whil ye i mean you think i think of the implications for example of blood pressure itlic we do not really understand a sentral high protension which is the majority of people walking around with high blood pressure it is unclear ediology a lats of people being treated how do we know that the belief system about it cannot be changed and a o this is this is i don' this is i open ye it is cool stuff and alycrumb is on to some other really cool stuff for instance im just to hig where these belief effects are straring to show up if you tell a group that the side effects of a drug that they are taking are evidence that the drug really works for the purpose that they are taking it even though those side effects or kind of annoying people report the experience as less awful and they report more relief from the primary symptoms that they are trying to target are our belief about what side effects are that is i can really impact how quickly and how u'm compatible a we feel about how quickly a drug wor excuse me and how compatible we feel that drug is with our entire life maye if we call them something else notside effects but a d tional benefits fom something it is kind of craze an you do not want alie to people obviously but you also do not want to send yourself in the opposite direction which is reading the list of side effects of a drug and then developing all of those side offacts am when and then maybe later coming to the understanding that some of those wo ere raised through belief effects a we definitely see that that is the noseebot affact rigt that ra that is the one we see a lot a with all sorts of drugs and it is tough because how do you how do which is which and i think there are some people who are really impacted by that and it makes it very difficult for them to take any sort of armeclogic agent because they basically they cannot help but incur every possible side effect is it is it true that medical students often will start developing the sympstoms of the different diseases that their learning about is that very well an i'll tell you i do think that in medical school you start te you start to think of the zebrs more than the horses all the time llike yyou known't i'm referring to rit atin a you see footprints you you see ho prints you should think of horses but of course medical students you only think of the zebras there are some really funny things in medical school there are certain conditions that you spend much time thinking about that you have a very warped sense of their prevalence you i can medical schoolers is condition called sarquedosis we i feel we never stop talking about sarquedoses i'e seem three cases in my life i it is just not that common this it provided great teaching tool or something i do not know a concus t some of these things i do not no ahow much time did we spend talking about cytus an verses this is when people embreo logically have a reversed rotation and everything in their body is flipped literally everything is flipped their heart is on their right side their livers on the left side their appendixis on the left side and i'm not making this acommon isi i've never seen eh a hing about boxig in the liver shot you go it you coan easily be going for the wrong side of the via i swear to god as a medical student if you were told someone had last cided lower quadrant pain to which the answer is almost assuredly that they have di vaticulitus you would think i could have a pendicitus in the context of citis and verses li the fact that that would even regiser in the top and things that it could possibly be why yes you just have a totally warp sense of what is out there omn well am this has been pure pleasure for me i do not know abo ass i do not about our listeners but for me this is among the things said i just delight in and and even more because you are the one across the table for me teaching me about these incredible find in iand li andend and the gaps in those findings which are equally incredible because they are equally important to know about let us do this again in osten absolutely next time on you are home court very well and bring a little bit of that do if you have got

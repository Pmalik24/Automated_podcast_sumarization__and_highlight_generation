of the show in the billboard when she was growing up her father was was not he is not a fun dad a he himself had been orphand in shanghai when he was twelve he was raised in poverty and because of that he was just this this mis pennypinture doesn even captured his miserly they did not celebrate christmas he never took his children to disney land even thoug it was less than an hour away from their home i therewre no real vacations sandrar tells this story of once she bought a book of chully brown comics for a dollar at book fare and herd father threw it across the room furious at how she had wasted money he he was restrict but at sandrar found ourisently not everyone in the world sees her father the way she does there is a kind of news that youre never prepared for and here last week was mine a friend told me that incredibly a local grunge band had composed a rock anthem about my dad and was performing it to great response an malabo aria clubs the group in question was called boy hits car and the song a wailing roc cree do cur powered by pearl jam rifts was in fact called mister low the actual cover of the boy hits car demotape was a grainily zerac'sd photo of a tiny wisen seventy sixureold chinese man grnning on a malaboo beach in tattered swim trunks which was indeed my father i have to admit however that the mister low in the song was not wen i was familiar with a seeing through the eyes of life guards last singer crag ron dell mister low is a mistecol dreamy figure who whins naked among the dolphins in the duality that characterize a certai tipes of rock poetry i reminded of the doors the nactural dance mister low does on the beach brings the listener comfort while at the same time poses o profound spiritual challenge s is n soa es tea te ea s asnes na n saano n san ann s n my first instinct was that this had to be a sic froidian joke when of my siblings was playing on me as in what is the most wildly unlikely most frock with amazing irones most wacky sixtys peter sellers shown thing you can imagine could happen to our family but no my father was these malaboo sirfor his eggman he was theire wallrest i decided to meet them cragrondelle base plarscot menville in guietars louis lenard were all too happy to come into a studio and explain how their song came to be thit was one day at the beach and theres about five of us just sitting in the sand is talking mister low came casually walking up and and he was staying there for just ay me three seconds without saying anything an wer cantly ke and then he said you are old victims of modern technology i my starte think hause i ca thats in o deepen then in just started to talk to us saing throughout the conversation instart singing that is where the song the premis cindin camedo you remember when you first saw my father i at's it imor desguess fall everlyememris but it was in nineteen seventy eight at the big fire camg our house burned down and removed m alte west and i remember seeing mister low stretching naked and then taking a shower outside naked and at the b at the beach and i thought has kind of funny but non a bad way i thought it was interested aas my first memory o ke i to had somer memories am ever since ihav been at that beach im awes since i wasin diperson five six seven a years old ha stand thernd i not some dan somer sods in the sander do not had stands against the wall i's a wal naked as well a what did you talking to these guis uht it suddenly occurred to me who my dad really is how every neighbourhood has its eccentric the cant lady the parent man the gind with the umbrella hat an recycling cart who yells well in my southern californian home town malabe west my dad is that person it is an unsettling thing to realize about one of your own parents and be ha behind mistelas back he was known as the naked han standman ears itin m a mi a i as a anse ery afti e the song s song wan you me the thon si o on if an on si no o there is a naked handstands in iste yes of course there is a naked hand stand mans song unbelievably mister low song a'd recorded was only the lates and a decae long esthetic exploration of my father on the part of boy hits a car basis scot manwell as te i was walking down reach one day tans tsta thaan an i happen to ter te his way tanstas tn tn tan there is i a man we o o ins ta anta e and is names nas ta lo tans ta aan tat he is ta th there wits tanns tand thas tans tan tan that he is the naked ans tand mand thans ans an tha's lo as tao o wi ta i well i invited my father to join me in the band in the studios he does not really see all the fuss about his nakedness for them boying stanfor that tad for you visy which i wen ther too in the man swimming pool everybody is nacked because that is the most si hi genic most aclin thing to do you see but if some young people when to see his nakedness is a symbol of something more important well my father's happy to be of service the way i discovered is tape was this one thin may be couplemens the gla hichike and the couple youn man picke me up thes i misi lo we hear that taba about you in the oh i see this rascl they di tav the and it is vey ni an va i feel te happy me onitou know probyt if they don write any son about me probin nobody wa ever write about me this i my li a yesi that is not trul ty as i've made my career writing about o s you see ut you see yon the writing i appreciate that too but yoi the something different thas tats ver precious for meu ee of course with all due respect to the members of boy hits car in my opinion my father is the least likely candidate to become a symbol of individual freedom of spiritual introspection of the healing powers of nature after all this is a man who believed all three of his children should get pchdes in engineering or else they would starve in the street then again all these things may be a matter of personal interpretation you see my father's nakedness as kind of that rebellion of some sorter no not actually i a son yes just he is be natural i feel that he as a bility to go beyond the general startip that americal holds in that regard and is free contack wi nate that is very important nodin the society as bus busy busy bus buty no much time in the talk you saf a talk in the na ou in nature but did you incronjous i remember asgits if you encouraged us to do that oh yes an when wa o we we do money things we always cool a lon ti su my beech to the lobbig you cannot to collect those illuminmen cans and we compete to with the fandemaden's family noant te goins t not to put too fine a point on it but a compe tition to collect cans for spare change is not the sort of communing with nature say while wit men an ralph maldo emerson extall which brings me to another point i have to say there is something sort of poinent about sitting in a room full of young people who are hanging on to my father's every word he is an odd little gooroo they is apostles god knows he never got that from my sister brother ar me at one point for reasons too complicated to explain here my father sang the boys in the band a chinese fik song that he had translated into french i may they tona ye lo y were you were you crying i my saya tears were coming why y why wi as his buniful as is ing unhinder ce expression of something i is faters toleging i just camin it ciis tenew why not sing another one if this makes my father happy well then i guess i'll try to be happy for him o osrr and sames to a sins sasos ohim y sm omi a just a saman tansamswdet te af the scriptin beckon i have it o

point of view it is about being a father he and brown recointed thes forecat ta shuther we did in font of live audience no one arive fashionably late for seven year olds birthday party that offende rule one of parental life never waste free baby sitting but all seven guests at my daughter haley's seventh birthday party we are dropped off by their parents mysteriously seven minutes early that sort of behaviour is just playin rude it was being swarmed by a gang from planet tiny they dropped their coats in the hall an immediately scattered to the farthest corners of the house some new instantly contagious form of biological weapon i staggered upstairs with a small mountain of coats in my arms which is not a chore i saw myself performing back when i was young and longing to be grown up even when i was eleven i wanted to be married because married people i knew had secs every night of their lives that is another story i was logging coats back downstairs trish the mother of caty hailey's best friend two best friends ago trish shot me a knowing look magician wriht how can you tell i said fibr opjic wans by the forks that was the first hint that my wife and i might have gone slightly over the top birthday wive that we might have stepped over the strict moral boundary that separates carring thoughtful parents who who believe in personal attention and quality time from cheeseballs us who trid to buy their way into their children's hearts it is easy to commit that social gaf these days my wife and i both work the harder we work the guiltier we feel the more we want haily's birthday parties to be well visible from outer space would be gratifying we would been planning hailey's seventh birthday ore to be slightly more accurate my wife johanna had been planning it and i'd been doing nothing for weeks what there was was a cake iced by professionals in the shape of a magician's top hat which cost thirty bucks eight lutbags filled with thoughtful age appropriate peanut free party favors at fifteen dollars a bag nd of course the magician himself hat a hundred fifty dollars for two hours he called himself the amazing robert i do not think he meant that ironically no i to do some especial on haly's birthday still do not you think i said to my wife is she frantically tried to find a magician who was not booked three months in advance do not you think we might be overr amping but honey if we do not go slightly crazy johana said quite logically some other parent will then what is heligan a think and anyway do you have a better idea and i did not have a better idea my sole contributian to the magician party had been to suggest that we include a whoopy cushion in every loutbag or or at least it was my idea to blow them up and put them in the lutbags preinflated in the old days when haly was small we kept her birthday simple i learned that lesson when i lived in loss angelist near beverly hills in beverly hill's parents their children's birthday parties to have a theme and a verly significant theme at that manifest destinye say or or a nass of moonshot in elle i never went to a birthday party that featured anything less than pony rides in one mother actually gave out gootchee tea shirts in the loot bags it was hard to compete with that in an act of defiance of friend of ours a struggling riter staged her daughter's birthday in a park of all places kis had a good enough time they ran around and swung on swings and played tag and generally revelled in a whole two hours when they were not under the watchful eye of ananny or armed response security the grab bags contained what grab bags are supposed to contain candy rather than rolex watches afterwards the beverley hill's parents flocked and literally flocked round our friend fabulous idea they said nature who would have fought can i steal a theme but our friend catherine is the queen of the less is more easy on mummy birthday party she says children want strong experiences not new ones which is why last week and for her daughter mary seventh birthday catherine invited seven six girls over to string gummy bears on to extra long bamboo sate skeers that was the theme of the party skuering candies on a stick there was some risk of i injury and the entire gimic seemed to have froidy an undertones the little girls kept saying i'm going to stick this skewer up gammy's tiny but and giggling hysterically but all in all it was a winner only one girl barfed the entire party cast fifteen bucks canadian it is true that catherine had a pinata pinatas are excellent because they entail hitting an object violently with a stick those whe're the old pre baccanalian birthdays by the ti haily turned five the year of our most corrupt and therefore most successful birthday we' gone as low as a parent can go we would hired human barby for three hundred dollars human barby dressed up in full sized versions of barby dall outfits and came to your house human barby arrived in a dodge gran caravan with human midge her assistant two giant mobal racks of party dresses for the girls a te set in a case a two chests of make up she dressed the kids discussed the possibility of multiple careers and fed them cake all our friends were completely horrifid i might as well have said oh this yere haily's having a rparty we are having a cake made of crack to my canadian friends put this crassnuss down to the fact that johana my wife is an american but successful while it was as if the dali lama had made o stop at our hous the girls were hitn atizes with awe they spent most of the afternoon standing in a circle brushing human barby's her i had the feeling that secretly quite a few mums would not have minded giving it to try themselves as it turned out i need not have worried about the amazing robbert the magician either he was a a handsome guy with side burns an a an a ry if somewhat resigned manner he knew what hewas doing though he he started cracking jokes awith the kids right away you must be haily said to one of the boys as he walked through the door no peter said i 'm a boy and clapped his hands hay the magician said no clapping to all the kids clapped i said no clapping by the time he start o pulling eggs out of their noses they were goners i chose that moment to run upstairs i find i need a moment alone at regular intervals at these kitty birthday bashes also at adult parties in fact i could use a moment alone right about now but when i opened the door to my bedroom what do i find lying lying on my bed surrounded by entire mountain ranges of miniature winter coats two of my adult guests holding hands their spouses were downstairs i must say they played at cool he headache the woman said rubbing her temples not that i askyei said these kids parties can be brutal i tell you i left fask i did not one to ask i certainly did not want to know downstairs the amazing robert was making cards disappear and reapper batrich katy's mum she kept staring at the magician i thought she disapproved of his tricks but then she gave a little shriek i kno she said i knew i knew that magician he has just come through a terrible divorce from a birthday clown it pretty much sais at all does not at it is terrible getting older the disappointments and the let downs but no child believes that they warnt to get older if you are seven you cannot wait to be nine me nine that is going to be the great st because they think life just gets better and better and better the older you get we grown ups we know better or we think we do or at least we need to think we do but i did not have much time for such madlin thoughts frankly convolused once because a new sound was was wafting in from the living room a sound it is frankly impossible to be maudling about they would found the loot bags crass sure cheesy absolutely grown up not at all that is what i liked about it an n i te ee nte co goen now and tromped out hol the

running up both sinds on who was walking down the steps away from me he had a brown tweed jacket on and brown leather shots and he was carrying two brown shuitcis he put them in his jeep back when they still sed willis on the side and he drove away the steps were a some mensteps pretty steep about three flights three little flights three steps then landing in three steps sdown and there was something crooked about them one of the steps that i went off at an angle thit was a an iron railing along the way not very pretty now i looked out the window and watched dad packing his car nd then driving away at that time what kind of car would it had been well he had bought a little sports car because his car was in the the garads in the shop and he had wont away till it was ready would you have been two or three days later and he bought a little car that he could leave right away and he told me he was leaving on a trip across the country because that is what he had to do in order to clear his mind and get his feet on the ground again whe packed up when he got in this little sports gard to goff what kind of car was it e was little triump a little wad to door with a neat little car which i should have got special for it for the trip and am my diy i just wanted to i just drove out wet i i i just anted to get get away from pitchburg and a and ad just sot of wear my head ot i thought and them i remember telling yohow ison it when i got back i thought i would i would et want to wan lo out i had a lot of different feelings i was angry that he done it i was angry that he had not ever taken dan in me a you and me on a trip rand he was walking down the steps away from me and he was hiring two rown shuitcases o put them in his jeep back when they still sed willis on his side and he drove away a little while before he left that day he knelt down in front of me and tightened my belt from me i have a picture of that his hans were bink bigger than mine will ever be farmer's hands or a ball players hands and he is sinching the belt tant e titer and san somthin i remeen ay i feel then i feel bad about all it it sort of gaps wun but i was not there and a all that time im in ot what a gon t gon you coan never get it back and at you do not relationships in many ways of built of memories more memories you have it he deeper the relationship and if you mis a several years of memories you o at heart well is the napshot of his doing your belt up for you when you were probably three or four an you were for when he left went you andi do not member er exactly what the feesion was it was oin had to men falling i be caus i member takin at pictures of you nsubuwekin we gettingether youd har and was all honor an he is sinching the belt gently tighter o hon hunccannot bak out the word a picture it was black and white and shows me standing there three years old in front of the big window that let the monochrome pitzburg light into the living oa light o stock you all of a hod burne to smell hi steel in that city had burned the colour out of the air and it reflects off his hair which is sooth with my talis and shows his strong jaw and the depths of his dark eyes youit was no abuse in that household harsh words thand i could her as notno father any more and my mother sobbing over the dishes in the sink what do you think you would have done after he had packed up his car and left what would have been your reaction that i might have observed oh you probably saw me sad and mournful but then turning back to the house and and i trying to look cheerful but i also felt i also felt abandoned that i felt that it was de othe end of a marriage and o my hopes for a marriage the end of a my hopes for family for you and me and he left us but i also felt as he drove out of sight well thank goodness what a sense of relief i am free of all that abuse and misunderstanding and bad feeling that have been going on for long and iat least i could be me now and and not try to be something that somebody else was making me be e i pet up with my doing and a on coming out of it sot of a commination of my own hou maturity restless iss ti satisfaction a in flate in hopes and expectation nd i think can i guess i at just felt that i had never i'd never had any he cand of freedom course i mean i never and ad never really found freedon afterward you ar you whele you got a change your ligft and and wone behold your life turned out to be about am i was three andly leaned over my bed which was narrow and told me this do not think this change is anything but dad's moving

my father left my bed ri was a turning point for me too it was the moment i moved outside the mith of the american family left it and became a part of something else something was no affirming mythology to look forward to m i rest his memory t day to look back ani became a part of divorge which was the death of the familyand i turned down a path less well mant less well but i unlike my father no longer wonder if it was for good or for ill adjusteyy r ok car well i think tnat'st about it a this well on the ra i for father's day a im i to wish wish you happy father's day ow think you you welcome and a and maybe we can make something good out of this year thank you much o ga right i leve le you man yu bym by an wjaal senten dan ro made by back of e ninedies when we first broadcast

but hat this next try is on is about a father and son the father was is a was this pretty well known man here in chicagol named james d ofrily he was an actor here and a director o from the nineteen sixty trogh h nineteen eighties and om among people went to theatre just you knows wentthy sopa everybody knew he is artistic director of the body politic theatre in the court theatre and om he was not a must reliable dad and his son a is a guide named beau orily who is a play wright ind local musician and a stages the lot of theatre here in town and a and beau has this story about om about his father including a moment in their lives when they did reconcile in a way when i was a little kid five or six my fath r woud do these big variety shows these musical reviears for college theatre groups nd i would often appeer with him playing the bad kitten tone or the clowns greeming the lines of this old man from the top of a step lader and at the shows end we woud rush first to the bak when my father knew all the girlt names and then to the train station to ketch the last trained home and i woud get very tense then an an hot and my stomach i was gin a burn up an pass out z we would often missed the last trained home and have to spend the long hours till morning waiting in the train station my father falling quickly asleet is huge hed thrown back in the train waiting rom seet it seemed to hang at an impossible odd angle from the rest of his body the dot at the bottom of a question mark that knows it hes to be there butd hangs od an un a tatched and this seene my father drunk and snoring of big question mark ove presence wood be repeated numbers of times over the next twenty five years my father passed out at the family tablin cristmas morning my father noding off behind the weel my father snoring through the still latin mass my father's head thrown back in the last rol during my highschool production of the glast managery but when he was awak he was not totally present either he wuz as silent brooding man home once a week for a family dinner and i would set up all night in that train station tlistening to the muted rumblings of the next mornings desolengions an the fluttering of pincons in the ceiling above my fathers snoring made rusty and noisy by two much cigarett san peer when i wus twenty nine something change between me and my father i wus twenty nine very drunk mo stayes and i came home to shucago to work for my father i guess i had rarely seen him in my alkoholica dulthood his alcoholcadulted heving taking him away from the family circle years ago and when my father he got me this job as o house manager and sometimes under study at his theatr on mecan avenue and he wuz warmin kind about it i guess this kindness was unusual was hard for me to recognize that i did not know whether it was kindness reelir a not maybe he jest recognized something in my swaying walk and my overly bright lold way of speaking a kindred alkoholic sperit we wood from then on do our drinking together late nights at the pub next door to the theater o pob were we could sit for hours get a burgeer an a bear y fob wer my father ran a tab and i wus always on the tad now ther pub tables were family long with my father always at the head an crowded with actors and confidance all with one ear pointed at my father hoping for a good joke from him which usually came or some word o praise which came rarer but when delivered were always delivered with a flare an a passion these tables wood start full full people an huge pints of black ginnes an brownd beer but by one or two in the morning they woud be emptyexcept for my father and i me talking loud an feverish now lovers an women an broken harts and politics an plays and broken harts and lost lovers and lost wim an an broken harts and me doing most of the talking my father nodding and grimacing looking appropriately sad but his eyes looking away always scanning the bodies of the young women who moved about on the pobs wating hours sometimes these women stopped by the table to speak to my father hi finding slyways to kiss and touch and pinch them walking their eyes with his as if his eyes were gift enough to allow him his in appropriate touching the fathe would close with us still in it the tables having adopted the chairs and now holding the piggy bak and my father would signed his tad with a flourish and we would part company me often watching him walk slowly up lincon avenue a large man with a lordly old fashioned hid always aware that he was something out of

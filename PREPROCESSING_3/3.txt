a folks earlier this week you remember that we reported on d e i inside medical schools diversity equity and inclusion over duke medical school surgical teams that are being infused with d e i principles medical schools that are teaching wokness as opposed to actual medicine and we ask you for tips and we have received those teps we are now breaking news about internal emales from usialized medical school which is one o of us in the country my wife went to ou seali medical school to great medical school but if you anno understand how d e i works at medical schools he have to c these demales these emales come from a manitory class that is called structural racism and health equity instructural racism and health equit ou sila medical students are told to read about wars of indigenous resistancs in which native americans killed thousands of white people to imagine what liberation could look is legitimately what is being taught a medical schools you siali you have to be inculcated into the cult of wokeness in order to actually acheve that which you seek to achieve which of course is the d e i principl meanwhile students are also taught about blackness and indigenaity and quote how we can imaginal world and the aftermouth of settler colonialism and white supremacy ands as students are also told that for further recommended reading they should read an article titled decolonization is not a mediphor which again whent when people say decolonization is not a medifor what they mean is that they are excusing actual violens imaginal world in the aftermouth of settler colonialism and and white supremacy by the way means eviceratingall the social structures because with the left means when thy say settler colonialism is literally anything the west has done and when they mean white supremacy they do not mean white people believing they are superior black people they just mean all the structures of society which they believe are inherently racis the emales from this first your class over ou sila medical school also reveal that students are encouraged listen to a pockkest titled indigena which covers it in array of unscientific arbate including people who identify as conqled two spirit and womic ston i becase you can say women because they concludes men as w o m ex and which is not even pronouncible what exactly makes this not st recommended but manitory class work for medstudents how exactly dos this mean that these are going to be better medical professionals the answer is it doesine it inculcates into them a set of values in that set of values then supposed to be carried for it into the practice of medicine youre supposed to presumably value certain pations more highly than others your supposed to treats your patients differently thst on race because after all your fighting white supremacy and settler colonialism these materials are not just irrelevant they are actually dangerous because again the only thing you should be taught in medical school is how to do the medicining you should not be taught about why various types of intersectional populations are more valuable than others because it turns out that the health recommendation for diabedies should be the same a cross the board it should not depend on the quonquot history of structural racism you should have to poul your punches because you are afraid of offending the somebody when the proper medical diagnosis of an issue requirs that diagnosis the only way to actually stop all of this is of course to expose it to that is what we have been doing again folks if you have and he sort of in formation newsworthe information you would to share go to tipstot daily wire dot com and go check them owt right now and send us whatever tips you have and we may reported on the show an meanwhile yesterday the big news o the day is that donald trump and jobidon had jueling trips down to the boarder and this sabout as bad press as you can have if you are jobidon this is your most volnerable issue according to the latest pulling dod at twenty eight per cent of american say emigration is now there top issue and on that issue jobidon ranks in the low thirties he is twenty points under water against donald trump on this issue may be thirty according to certain poles and he heads downs theboar at the exact same time that trump is on the board which is always gon to go portly for him this of course comes at the same exact time that polling is showing him trailing donald trump in a wide variety of battle ground states brand new bloomburg news morning consul swing state voter survey published on thirsday shows trump is a head of bidon narisz on a forty nine forty three in george a forty nine forty three in michigan forty six forty four in nevat of forty eight forty two in north carolina fifty to forty one in pennsylvania forty nine to forty three and in wisconsin forty six to forty two was ar devastatingly terrible numbers the close to state there is michigan wish tof forses as we will discuss wi jobidon is now pandering to the comaspans in deerborn it should be pointed out by the way that when it comes to michigan the exaggerated tale of how jobidon if ye appeals comosnex win michigan is not true when people say that a hundred thousand unpeople voted un committed in the state of michigan teres us up thirteen per cent of the number of people who voted in the michigan democratic primary whebrokobama in twenty twelve ran about ten per cent of people in the democratic primary voted un committed and if you go and look at deerborn michigan maybou four five thousand people total voted un committed in geerborn michigan which was supposed to be the place where jobidon was gnin just absolutely get sho lack by the arab american population that tends to be dist proportionately procomas in reality a lot ofpeopleare poting on committed against jobidon not be cause of the comas war the are voting against jobidon or voting on committed because they do not think he is a very good president in any case the forty fifth president onnal trump according to the nearo post beats out bidon in a fiveway ballatust trump is forty three bidon thirty seven ar if kag gets nine per cent cornall west and green party candidate jolstine get one per cent each and in ahead to head trump is ahead further a a large part of this is because people think that jobidon is not just in competent they think that he is senile and that is because he is both in competent as well as seenile according to the washington post bidon an trump headed to different parts of the border they' vitted visited separate texas border towns presidentin bidan whent to brownsvolt texas which is the place where the emigration promem has largely been brought under control meanwhile donal trump when to eagle past which of course is were emigration has not been brought under control jobiding in go to eagle pass because it lookrally ugly for him but actuallby quite hideous he going to eagle pass and then in the background jou see i legal emigrants rushing across the border shouting jobidon's name that probably a bad looked for him see him't go to eagle pass none them went to the bordeirn ar isown ut where we went which is very actually seeng most o the fentinal trafficang happening right now all is also comes amidst jobiding's white house referring to e legal emigrants as new comers i'm not getting you thiss the thing that they did there is a white house factry those put forad on the senate bill that includes some language with regards the border and here is what thewhite house has quote the bill includes one point for billion dollars for cities and states for providing critical services to new comers and would extpredite work from his for peoplewho are in the country and qualify they keep using the word newcomers as supposed to be legal emmigrants how warm doyou think americans are for that proposal seriously that these are just new comers as appose tou people whre he legally entring the country how many people believe it when allahandr mayarcus the secretary homlentsecurity says that no executive action jobidon can take whuld fix the border crisis we know for a fact there are significant executive actions that jobidon took as soon as he took offics to reverse what donald from had done on the border itself hereis allahondromaarcas however protesting that actually actually jobidin cannot do enough there is nothinghe can do on the boarde of yhea executive action despite the fact that donald trumpted oexecutive actions that the president can take to reduce the number the large number of migrant that the or cominto the ouhas net te of border that we sawin weny eny three continue this here act tof the matter is tht e it only enduring solution is legislation congress nes tho ac we have ie bi ardisan es o letislation that re seneters wor on i tanly wer number of onts was gr rivilete be the table te i tecnical an operationalis r tes menis ration was reper san i av the table we need congress to act nobody actually believes that they need congress to act he is in donald trump did not need congress to act what did jobidan actually do when he got towns the bord will first he staggered round a lot an the vidio of jobidan just looks terrible it looks as though members of border patrol ar is scording in all timeor pations on a walk about that is what it looks he can berily stagger meanis just looks to i'msarry it looks awful the presidents of the united states does not he is not physically capable of this job a mean luk look at this this iit is honestly it stad to watch he is effect ely dragging his feet you'r a praid he is gon is slip on the gravel and and fall over he can hardly walk more than a few steps is the sort of commanding image dho you want to be demonstratig in america southern border which is wide open to the drug car tells and make no mistate jobidons policies have fomented the designs of the drugcar tells again go check out the first episode of our series divided states dobiden over at daily wire and you will see that jobidon has left that southern boarder wide open and he is basically acting at the behast of the drugcar tells of this point the drugcar tells our rushing e legal emigrance to certain parts of the border as to read o ract boarder patrol from other parts of the boarder and then once those parts of the border are left unoccupied that is when the drugcar tells rush across all the guises with the backpacks filled lifentinal that is his actualy happening at the border and seeing a staggering dottering old man barily holding himself upright around the border is not exactly a good look then jobidon tries to blame republicans for not putting together a by partizan consents a son himigration there is a bi partizan contentus close the border just do it no one stopping you dod but here is jobin trying to blame donald trump it is not going to work can my ce ii legal pass saso ire sa to mister co shuca paus shu choling mibers a carer to bouk for soe srasi jooing r a'll joing you an chollin te con passis far paron boardis securite we can do it to geter you known i no just the chumpes fosticshishon t fect that bordis scurh gos crecteris ever shee sus tu the crint cpalli tou e whonter we discic to givin gin ge except for the fact that you could to it yourself your on administration is floated trial balloons about returning to re main in mexico thea executive action his a winning issue for donald trump which is why jobiden went down to the border an actively humiliated himself further i truly think your people asked who exactly's running t the bidon whitehouse he is runningthe bidin campaign give in the absolutein compitence of this campaign the answer is jobidon his a massive piarbooboo for jobidon just a couple weeks ago he commited another mass of piarbooboo he had the the prosecuteorf the special prosecutor who is looking into his mishandling classfight in formation basically say that he is a seenil dottered and he immediately rush to the microphones to prove it and he held a a late night press conference by late night ime s seven thirty at night but for him that is late night that is well after the den he is early bird specialist vailable and he is normally tuckin bet by that point he does a press conference trying to demonstrate h's mental acuity and in the process proceeds to cal the president of egypt the president of mexico and forget were exactly his son got his rosary the only person who made that call was jobidon who made the call to sand jobiding down to the boarder to dotter around and totter around on a gravel road and then blame donald trump it is it is only got to be bidon it is got be biden himself eis i if you i makesense if you are goin go down to the border and announced strong action on the border than to make sents to go the border fre n a go there n just look at things he makes no sense at all you look not only what coul do nothing it looks your ignoring the waves of e legal imigration thet havit crippled the country for the last several years meanwhile again tonel from him self went down to the border as well and i'll leave it to you to decide who is closer to the median american on this particular issue donal trump or jobiden here is nonal trum talking about this being a joby n invation he is cracte this is a jo by invasion this is a bidin invasion over the past three years i call him crooked jo because he is crooked es a terrible president is president our countries ever had a probably the most incompetent president we have ever had but it sr allowing thousands and thousands of people to come in from china a ran yamin the congo seria and a lot of other nations many nations are not very friendly to us hes transported the entire colums of a fighting aged men in the roll at a certain age an you look at im misse del they looke warriors to me somethings going on tas bad now the united states is being overrun by the bidin migrant crime it is a new form of avisious violation to our country it is migrant crime we go at bidin my gooncrimebut that is a little bet along ill just lave it but every time cer here that ter migrin crime where that comes from allowing thou sands and thousands and actually millions an millions of people to come could be fifteen in could be eighteen million by the time he gets out of office gay well it may not be fifteen riting but is certainly seven t ten and then trum put forward a pretty ovis proposition which as be seen a wide variety of crimes committed by legal imigrants of the course of last wec alone we reported the here on the show and and here is dona trum poining out jo bidin dos in fact o blood on his hands and there is no other way put that when you decide to leave the border wide open when you decde herecin a change of silum policy that in order for you to be release in the country all you have to do i say i fear to go home you are going gain up with an awful ot peoplew come at crimes in the country and again there'r the a lot of arguments is whether illegal imigration increaseis the crime wrate or whether hi legal imigrants have a lower crime write in for an subsections of theamerican population that is o relevant zero crime it should be committed by people who ark here illegally because the should not be here in the first place here is not a trum going off on biden les yerisediticalegalalien criminal who as released into our country by jo biden was arrested for raping an eleven year o girl an stree gling her to death an pacedin e texs and shortly before she was murdered she texto the father that someone as knocking at the door he arrived home from work and found his dorderis bodyes stuffed in alondry bascet underneath the bed horrible crooked jo is the blood of countless citizen victims it is many sories to tell many horrible stories three years ago ad the most secure boter inis try brand as tying the general as saying it wit the most secure boter and people will notcome because they they wul get t get in he is right he is rights who is a major fal by jo bdon he looks feeble looks out a touch hlooks he is not taking the action that he should all the suprobem for him now the media are simultaneously trying to put to bad the border issued by blaming it on both sides and then trying to put to bed the hunter bidin corruption issue that issue is nock and go away s the media been trying to play up the fact that the f bi is prosecuting an unnamed sorcs who was quoted by the f bi at one point with regard to the idea that jobidon was paid directly five million dollars and was hunter bidon af that was a very small part of the hunter bi incason was late breaking we been reporting onthe hunter bidin corruption allegations for legitimately several geaters by the time that report from the f bei t was even pushed out intothe public by the house over sy committee with that is that hunter bidon testified behind close dors the other day and te media basically declared that the hunter bidin corruption story is now over because hunter bidon i justified that his fatherhad nothing to do with it tand really he was just tat he was all cause he was high or drunk none of this passes the smell test for example according to the naropost first son hunter bidin claims in congressional testimony on wednesday that he was high or drunk when he wrote to a chinese associate in twenty seventeen that he was quote sitting here with my father shortly before the trans for of five point one million dollars in to bidin family linkth account a readout of the fifty four year old first son's close dor impeachment inquiried up at is ission with previded to numerous news atletts on wednesday evening siting hunter's claim tat bidon had nothing to do with the shape down wof the chinese statelin c e f china energy you recall the story is a story in which hunter bidon was on what sap with a person name jaw and demanded a bunch of money and said i'm sitting right here next to my father and if you do not give us what we want my father is going to basically put the screwse to you publicly according to the redoubt it said that hunter admitted he was high or drunk when he sent the sitting here with my father what is that message tht he and he says he sended to the wrong recipients and is now embarrassed by the message the same sorce af that hnter confirmed his dad was not sitting next to him well there is only one problem why exactly would you believe hunter bidon basically the case hunter bidn is now making tis that you have contemporaneous what is at message is showing i was af my dad's house at the time and my dad was home and then magit he says that he sent the text the what is hap to the wrong jaw at did not athaly go to gaherans fs u somm randum gui name jaw wear then that the next day five million bucks chowed up from jao an his account what a coinkidink or alternatively this sounds a giant lie since hunter appeared under a sepina the text in the testimony technal ly counted as a more sensitive definition rive than a typical transcribed interview that what is hap missive the implicating jobidn was provide to congrss last year by the ires case agents joseph zigler again the most damning stuff with regard to hunter bidn as all stuff that hunter biding himself set forget about what people set about hunter bidon twhenty babylinskes the world the most damaging st f that is said in the hunter bidin case was all set by hunter bidon but what is that message saying my daddy is sitting right here with me give me what i want the tax to his own daughter saying i've been paying this family's buills for half half the families builds for all of my life dadjust takes my money mike all that suffis incredibly damaging in its directly from him again that the fact that that the metia are trying to suggest that basically the case is now over yet no it is not and even if it does not and in joe bidons impeachment the widespread perception of the bidn family which is correct is that it is deeply crot because obviously it is every single personalil the last name bin has been making money off joe being in politics for legitimately decades at this point since the nineteen seventies for half a century they we makin money off joe in politics and everyone knows it and meanwhile i am please that the republicans decided that they would not in fact jump on a rake the speaker of the house my johnson he did sign off on a temporary spending buill to prevent a partial government shut down this weeken now bunch people on the righter very upset with my johnson because they believe that every time there is a spending buill that the power of the purselize wat the house the house has an obligation not to abuse the power of the purse and that basily that means that any time the republican house has the chance they should use the leverage in ord to lower the spending the point that i makings that on principle i agree with that whn it comes to the purepolitics of the situationthat the very bat idea those two things can simultaneously coxest n the best of all possible worlds who 'ld run every appropriations bilt through the appropriations processe in the best of ll possible world republican houses would initiate only the kinds is spending that are constitutional which would cut government spending by approximately ninety eight perscent with all of that said if the republicans were to jump on the jiant rake right in front of them and shut down the government right now asjo bidon is proceeding along the course of election lost that would be political mou practice the reality is wou can only achieve large scale change in american government when have unified control of the government the days of by partisan cooperation on things budged balancing are well over that is not going to happen any more the clintonian era in which democrats an republicans after the ninety six election came together to do wellfare form that is a thing that is not going to happen again which means that republicans i can have to tratsen short term laws for some long term gain if they hope to win back political power my johnson knows that is the first stine that myght johnson actually i think is is using his political common sense here rather than being held captive by the republican potice here is my johnson yesterday announsing that they were not going to shut down the government syes look the appropriasion appropriatious presis is is ugly the muxyis ugly am this is the wayt worke every year always has except that we have insitutisan o innovations we brok the umlybus feverry that is how uashington is been run for years wer we are we are trying to turn the earcraft currier back to real budgetin it spending reform th is was an important thing to break it up in the smaller piece a gat now the problem for might johnson that is gn crop up going forward is that the process that he used here he could theoretically also used with regard to any sort of ade package for you criner israel and that is what the bine administration immediately is jumping on the the approval in the house for some sort of big aid package on the foreign front is very large would get at least three hundred probably three undred fifty votes in the house for some sort of aide package at this point and johnson has been holding at back presumably because he is afraid that hes can to lose his speakership position yesterday however he did bring forard a proposal that ninety nine republicans voted agains most republicans did back the speaker but those also true of kemmacarthy when cevmacarthy was passing bills he is doing it witht the majority of of the republicans but he is doing with some democrats as well and that apparently was enough of a in fror matgates and others to try to auston sothe question is where is that wing of the party now represent of anny bigs who is one of these people voted against the deadline extensions and said that johnson has it worked hard enough to cut spending and tht he squandered house republicans sole source of leverage by on being unwilling to shut down the government but in reality again at some point the speaker of the house is going to have to actually govern or he is not con be espeaker very long he is gon be th minority leader very soon in meanwhile jobidon again is operating under the bizar proposition that if he caves to comma somehow this will be better for his presidency it is it is a very weird proposition you not americans do not very much when american allies lose they do not when america basically fosters terrorist victory you now we know that c they did not afgannistan jobidn did that an afganistan and his approvalrating absolutely tankan an is never recovered the media may be disquieted by the ugliness of war but not the american people really really do not when america's enemies people wo hate america when americans really do not that very much we do not tthe war in our face is all the time but there' something we even less and that is losing wars i understand that this his become the way that the media have basely controlled american form policy for for decades ot this point a prety much every american foreign policy has been in initiation of force or support of force by an ally and then the media immediately attempt tod to do he what war is very uglies very ugly what here is the problem america's enemies know that war is ugly and they know that americans care that war is ugly and s they attempt to leverage that that is prosone thats exactly or comass is doing right now according to the wallstre journal senior members of comsses leadership an exile met in dohocats ar earlier this month amid concerns as fighters were gtting mauled by the israily offensiv in the gose trip andemy troops were killing dozens of militans each day as they methodically over oun comas strongholds then a courier arrived with a message from yachyasinoir the ead of cmassand gasa saying n effect do not worry we have the israilies right were we want them comases fighters the alcosombrigades were doing fine the uppy message said the militans were ready for israel's expected assault on rafa is city on gassas southern edge high civilian casualties would add to the world wide pressure on israel to stop the war sin wars message seid according to people informed about the meeting and this is this is how comas wins the wacomas wins is not by winning at least twelve thousand members of comm as direct militant members of omasav been killed along with a bunch of fellow travellers remember when you read statistics about women and children who are killed in gaza many of the people who are con sidered children under a normal definition of crile beaning under eighteen years old many of those are sixteen year old boys wor fellow travellers with comas for example we do not actually have strait statistics from inside the gosastrip because comas that is providing them and commas lize all the time if you really believe tha comasis going around counting bodies and identifying who is died they are making an up on the spot legitimately making it up we know this for a fact which is why it is pathetic that for example the biding administration continues to mimic the propagan to put out by commas that is what comas wants comas has only one plan to survive this ghet enough palistnian civilians killed that they can then get the international community of pressure israel to preserving komas that is all they want out of life right now and bizarely that is exactly what members the bine administration and the europeans are doing the are nows suggesting that israel basically ought to leave commas in place because they do not leave comas in place then too many people will die because of comas ok kat tht is a formula for never winning a war again for any one who is in the wess meve basically just given them the upper hand the more evil and brutal they are toward their own civilians the more yoare going to leave them alone seems to be the prevailing message here meanwhile by the way israel is supposed to ignore the fact that it is own citizens are still bein killed an other words when comas and its allies in palsonian authority murder is railies the world does not care one ioda at all yesterday and a story that no one covered to israily citizens were murdered at a gas station in aly which is in the west bank a palistonian terrorist open fire at the gastations to be the second time in a year that this gastation has been targeted by terrorists and as it turns out one of the one of the people who committed the attack is a member of the palistonian authority police t palisnian authority those of the people that the bide administration would to run the gasistrip the palistonian authority s the biniminstritions plan and midal east is to hand over power to the palisonian authority which literally pays people who murderd yus pays their families and preserve komas presume bely in order that jobidon can win michigan or something and and again let us be very clear about this there is no party on the other side of the isle from israel that is willing to make anything a lasting peace it does not exist for example here is a senior palistonian official just this week talking bouthahitler was right this is very typical rhetoric in the palistonian authority is as several european american and arab ifficials have said innthat in is railly attack against the palistonians in rafaf ye would constitute a no less or crime than the holicos anean ulk we i w'ld to ask wides in the holicos happene maan i am not a fan of hitler by haeweecan but when hitler perpetrated the holicostels anhad ovias reasons oan y the jews and glubbozinas were offered various places in the word an a h beimacan ei n thn argenzina no ganza n the north of sini in the south of arawwecane an the chose palestine for other reasons that we may mention later u no godwanthey plans to take control of germany a tis the palsin an authority as the jews plan to take control of germany hiller had to kill them obviously these ae the people that that jobidon would to leave in place and give power all f this has been exascerbated by an incident that happened inside the gasistrip andthere two accounts of this incideve one is the account that is being perpetrated by comas and alga'zera which has run by cotarwich of course works very closely with the leadership of comasin and supports comas and the other is the idea one account is it bact by zerofootage but a lot of an atotal accounts and one is back by actual dronefootage the account that is being pushed out there by the palsinan authority by cmas by the europeans is an account in which is raily forces open fire on a bunch of people who are trying to get aid humanitarinade that these railies themselves are carrying in there israel has created a humanitarian corridor aid can get in comoss by the way has ben high jacking all of the sate an stealing all of it and then killing people who are tempting to stop them in that effort which his created a massive poverty an hunger situation in the gozestript despite the fact that israels placing literally no limits on food aid going in there is no one to distribute it is the problem because coms kills people and then takes the food not only that theisrailies have been puttng their own troops in a harm's way in order to try to provide humanitarinate a by way all this ands literally tday if comasurrenders and gives up the one hundred and thirty four hostages it is currently holding everunjest pretends that that never happened whe the comas does not exist any more or something the white counts is still saying they do not know what happened and no one knows what except for the dronefootage and they called at tremendously alarming what happened israels shared dron footage of troops attempts to desperse a swelling mobs and in responsibility for the massdeths amid international criticism of its gaza fensive comemass as blamed the idea for reported one hundred four deaths in te early morning hours now we still do not know how many people have actually died at this ploing because coms lis about it stafts the militaryes said that fewer than ten of the casualties were result of his raily fire and the released new details thursday night plaming soldiers had fired warning shots and attempted to ease the crussher people looting a convoy of aid trucks that entered northern gaza early on thursday morning the violence was quickly condemned by ar countries and jobidon held talks on the inciden witht leaders of egypt and cutar and then both the white house and stake department expressed horr over what occurred and indicated hy oue demand answers from israel now gan nobody ever demands answers from komas on why they are looting aid trucks and nobody ever demands apparently the commas jus surrender they are currently holding negotiations with komas that force the ideav to publish a dronvidio showing thousands of people swarming around the aid trucks as they reache the area in northern goza the vehicles tried to push forward very slowly and then apparently what happend is as they tried to back away many gozins decided that they were going to rush the soldiers and a tank at an idaf check point ters after they 'ad already rushd the last truck in the convoy further south that is when some is raily soldiers open fire on people who are literally rushing a border check point and a tank they did not open fire on the radicun see from the dron foot is theu're not opening fire on the crowd look at the size of this crowd they hear the aid trucks for those who cannot see he looks world worza amean this is just thousands of people for crowding these aid trucks trying get food presumably the israilies of this poin if they wanted to masser or people seriously cot of there is no fire un see they mean every aid truck is being crowded by thousands of people thousands and then israel is trying to slowly back away teyhave tanks cay theyhave again overwhelming fire power most of the people who ware injured and killed were killed in this crush because there is a mob rush on the aid trucks and then apparently they fired some warning shots to trid to disperse the crowd som that the ad trucks could move and then some people rush the israilly soldiers some these araily soldiers further up and some people were killed this of course ended with a bunch of of people in the uen and t e european unian claiming that ths all israel's fault which is amazing because it turns out that it is al komases fault again hamas started a war when you rush across another nations borders and killed twelve hundred of its citizens and take two hundred forty hostage that tends to lead to war according to the ideaf spokes person he said this marning the idf coordinated convoy of thirty eight trucks to provide additonal humanitarian assistance to the residence of northern gaza thi humanitarianaid came from egypt when through a securitys screeting at the carum at shollem humanitarian crossing an israel and then entered goza for distribution by rivate contractors as these vital humanitarian suppliys made their way toward gozens in need thousands of gozens rush the trucks some began violently pushing an trampling other gozens to death looting the humanitarian supplies theye are the fact at four forty a m the first ai truck in the humanitarian convoy stare tod making its way through the humanitarian quarter that we were securing aur tanks were there to secure the ommandiar a humanitarian corridor for the aid convoy are you a vese were there in the aire to give our forces the clear picture fom abov at four forty five a m a mob ambush the aid trucks bringing the convoy to a halt in this vidio the tanks that were there to secure the convoy swalve the gozens being trampled and cautiously tried to disperse the mob with a few warning shots when the hundreds became thousands in things got out of hand the tnk commander decided to retreat to avoid harms the thousands of gozens that were there you can sal cautious they were when they were backing up there is vidioto back all this there is drown thift footed volv this they were backing up securely risking their own lives not shooting at themob no idea strike was conducted toward the aight convoy on the contrary the ideaf was theire carring out a humanitarian ahte operation to secure the humanditarian quarter to allow the eight conviy to reach its distribution point the humanitarian aidt could reach gosn civillians in the north who are in need then of coursouty egypt jored an the allacuse isral of targning civilians in the incident of course and sorted turkey which of coursebacks comoss and france which can always be counted on to take the the antismatic position they said the fire by his railly soldiers againt civillians trung to acces food is unjustifiable spain also the most antismetic country in europe they said something similar ye hat of course wi stavo petro was the left wing presient of columbia announcing that is government was suspending purchases of weapons from israel agan is a blood libele the evidence suggested isral dod not in fact t open fire into a crowd of civilians if they had would all be on that yuwavfootage which it does not but that does not matter that does not matter and this is why again members the meet are looking for moral equivalents beyond anything else ha really looking for it seean en properly reported for example that this was a chaotic incident which it was and because nobody actually knows what happened yet even seean ends headline here is misleading they say at least one hundred ckilled an seven hundred injured and chaoticansinat were ideaf open fire as people waited for food and gza palistinian official say again that that even that headline is misleading but hat was n good enough for john steward whose constantly in search of moral equivalence he said ynote to sean an a chaotic incident is college hud storming abascobulcor not a massacre at a food line again maskar f food line assumes facts not an evidence that does not matter that does not matter and ten jobidon of course comes ford and says this incident is en a complicate the negotiations what is complicated the negotiations what is cont camas has rejected every sees fire gell presented to it because they insist that israel leave them alone and leave them in power this dottering old fool when h's not eating ice cram an talking about seas fires tha are unachievable is not beding ice creman talking about seas fires that are unachievable the deadly gozat incident complicates hossage negotiations that incident happens because camas is starving the people of gaza they started a war they do not care whether those people livered i in fact that is wrong they want them todi but here is jobidon doing the dirty work i know o no s gon a complicated the negotiation an lending moral credibility to commas to terris this not a good look you on a losen elections the reallhe god way to do it he thinksigan a wind five thousand votes in dearborns can lo hundreds of thousands evotes across the country they sent his absolute cowardice on issies this one an by the way he is still claiming that he is hopeful about the eas fire whiches again first rule of negotiations do not go out and publicly talk about the negotiations you dofus here he was probably not by mondaybot y's hopeful based on what based on what the reality is that because he is talking bout the negotiations publicly he is giving every piece of leverage to kommas he is saing i want this i want to sees fires bad i can taste it and comas is watchingan give us for it what we get for it now the reality is what is actually happening for kamas and ces ballaw which are both run by run beth homas and kis balla our hoping that israel does not going to rafa if israel goes into rafa it is going to finish off kommas yacca sinwar will likely to capture or killed when that happens israel presume we will turn north caus balla is threatening that if israel goes into rafa atf cis ball is going to open in northern front jobidon wants to prevent all of that not because it would drag america into war it would not israel would just go hog wild on his balla n the north is what would happen bidon was to revent thactk is again he is afraid he is going to lose michigan that is all is about if jobidon were secure in his knowledge that that the arab americans in michigan we are going to vote for him he would not care if tht is the reality because again it is actually in america's interest for terrorous groups to get their gut stomped out terras groups our a threats to america and its allies ou be very much in america's interest watch is rael just walk right over kis balla again no american troups invalved no serious american cash committed instead jobidon is trying to to have it both ways he knows inherently that if komas remains in place is going to be bad for im politically but again he is still trying to pretend tat there is moral equivalents as to achieve in alf ramp that will amount to many many more people killed over th over the coming years it absolute and he is got his members of administration doing this two loid austin the the garbage secretary of devfente he is still sighting comas cashalty figures mis ter secretary about how many pellistinman womemen kildren have been killed by isral ine october seventh su youks over twenty for fors he those are commas cashalty figures by the way that the numbers that he is using right there even comasaesn't claim that at least twelve thousand military age mails ae been killed it is cowardice does not when you elections and it does not win you wars what it does win you is is a seat in the old age home thinking about wyyou are no longer president after one term as what it astually win to heand just one second we will get to thebide daministration softly backing away from its one environ mentalist ideas first lady ballers is the hilarias story of how group of mail loosers who cannot win against other men decided to identify as women ang woen women's baskobully absurd ridiculous yes except that it is actually happening right now look here is a quick look what is being called the most trigglring moovy of the decade isrdaninttranobi wa on lady ballers movi es to be far anetlat lis televen otyemaer trstreaming exclusively on daily wire plus son't wait wach lady bllers the movy holliwood did not makesop we did exclusively at delware plus right now and meanwhile the bindaminstration they know how vulnerable they are and that is why they are having the e p actually delay a k climate rule and then the'r aking up a reason why they are doing that according to the washington posed the environmental protection agents he plans to delay final limits on planet warming aemissions from gas power the gas fired power plans is significantly strengthen them the agenty announced on thursday the decision means the rule will not be finalize until after november wyse actly to that cat telate wright the is a big priority for the environmentalists very green bide administration is to get the e p a to basically shut down gas fired power plants now the reason are not doing it is pretty obvious if the energy prices go up jo bidon could lose the election s instead the e pas can make up another excuse the move comes in response to please from environmental justice groups which said the rule is not protective enough of disadvantaged communities that breath the unhealthy airfordecades communities of color and lowin come neighborhoods are just proportionately located near gas plant smoke stacks and other sources of industrial pollution it also comes bid an tries to sell voters on his climate record during a brusing reelectiong campaign against at donal trump son made twenty twenty three the e p a issue to proposed rule that call for drastically curbing green house gas missions from existing col plants existing gas plants and new gas plants the agency said thursday that they are till on tract to finalize the rule for existing coal plants and new gas plants in april but said the rule for existing gas plants would take longer why there ar their pretending that is because they'r environmentalists but you may notice something the reason that they are putting a bunch of pressure on existing col plants is because most energy is not coming from existing col plants and the reason they can put pressure on new gas plants is because that is not can manifest until after the election anyway what is the one area of the law where the e p is avoiding issuing a ruling on the stuff for you mostly get your energy which is the existing gas plants and the the pretending is for environmentalist reasons that is a wy they know that they are environmentalist nonsense is really really on popular with americans americans to pay verbal omage to the idea that they care deeply about the cplimate when it comes time to actuolly pay up in any serious way americans are not into it especially because they know thet whatever marginal sacrifice at they make is going to be offset by whatever increased demissions china in india then provide to the world and it turns out that the climate is global and they no matter how much you cut your missions of china and india are making up more than that amount all youre doing is destroying your own economies of china and economy can grow theirs jobiden knows that and his people are smart enough to tell him du you really really cannot have a massive inflationary spiral on energy priceis going into and election cychel cam meanwhile vladmrapoutent sensing mush in the bide administration is now raise the spector of newcleater conflict if you craing to allies step further into the war pooten keeps saying this over and over and over this not the first time that he is threaten nucleer war the talk of newclear escalation in putens anuall parliamentary speechon thors day rein forces the russian presidents framing of the warn ou crane as an eccistential conflict with the west now there is been some talk about vladmer puten taking a look at moldova the the there ther bunch of nations that that surround russia that have heavy russian populations is a breakaway region in moldova that has now appeal to vladimer putent for protection which is the way very often that territorially aggressive dictators then pave the way for invasion of surrounding states glamerputen is not hitler for variety of resons but territorily aggrssive dectators thelay youtypically do this is you find a region of a foreign country that has a lot of speakers of your language and thn you have them appeal to you for production and then you walk across the word to protect them according to sianen pror russian rebels and a separate to sliver of moldova have now aske puten to protect their region from what they claim are threats from moldovas at government trans nese trea which a legally spsplit from moldova as the soviat union crumbled has remained within the krumlantorbit while moldova is bidding to join the eu again they are looking for protection because again if you are bordering russia you would tonato and u protection for shore politicions intrans nistre asked moscow to guard it from increasing pressure from moldova the krumblans had protecting its compatriots were a priority again if you are looking at the region of transnistria transnistria is bordering you moldova borders you crane its between romania and urane transnistria is an un recognized breakaway region han ve along the borders of moldova and ukrane itwould be strategically useful for the russians to hold it for shore if they were able to somehow jut or round from krimia up into that region then they would have a fairly significant chunk of you crane surrounded on three sides krimia in the south the donbas region in the east and the transistre region in the west with that said do the russians wantgo war moldova is in aa lot closer to the rest of europe then the eastern regions of ukrane according to sianen no country officially recognizes transnistria russia has about fifteen hundred troops there right now again are the are they willing to up the anti right now will russias warn you cranes had a profound effect on transnistr as economy you crane closed its border with trans rustraa when the war began because again their afraid that it is a a russian run region the ware is spurring moldova to try to resolve the decades long conflict with transnistria that ou ha's granted moldova candidate status in june twenty twenty to indecember twenty twenty three they started negotiating to formally bring moldova into the eu again this could be another point of conflict and that combined with the fact of laterputent again threatening neuclear weapons suggest that there are better be some offram pere soon puten is pussiong where there is motion he sing an awful lot of much already folks coming

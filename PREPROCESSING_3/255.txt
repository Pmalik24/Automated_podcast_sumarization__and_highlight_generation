a quick warning there are curse words that are unbeeped intoday's episode of the sho if you prefer a beep version you can find that at our websihte this american life dotork from w b easy chicago it is this american life i'm shon call in for irglass the first punch landed on sort of the lower back right side of my skull behind my ear that was the one that knocked me down this was a couple sommers agoe i'd been walking down thi sort of abandoned industrial blolk in my neighborhood in brooklin it was after midnight there was a big group of kids tea nagers boys maybe nine or ten of them coming the other way i was on the sidewalk they were walking in the middle of the street where the cars goe also was on the phone with my friend sam talking to him with my ear buds in i just kept walking in talking glancing over at the kids a couple times and then i saw them see me and they sort of stopped and said something to each other and then a few of them casually i would not notice started walking in my direction i do not know if taking off in a sprint was the best decision or if you could even call it a decision a couple of the kids said yeh there are a few things i remember about the next thirty seconds or and a few things i done i remember looking down at my shoes and thinking why cannot i run any faster than this sam said what is happening i said i'm being chase who is chasing you he said they are chasing me i apparently said which i do not remember i do not remember how i got off the ground after the first punch i just know that a second later i was running again and still getting punched in the head being punched in the head while running becomes with standable remarkably quickly after the second head my skull was if this is all that is going to happen you can manage one kid way in the back noere near me yelled give me your wallet but laughing it was a joke they never tried to take anything the easily could have i've tried to come up with something to compare the experience of it too but i've never felt anything else that intensely i've never felt as good in my life as how bad that was i rounded the corner and saw a semi tru coming as the only moving vehicle around i ran toward it with my arms straight up over my head and when i looked back the kids had vanaghed gaune just they would never been there in the first place i slowed to a walk which is when i noticed my earbuds were neatly spooled around my left angle id done it on purpose one of them was smashed and when i lifted the other one up toward my face o oi oo o o me sam was still on the phone t o y you o i t o gi o o o wa a at er this recording is the whole reason i'm telling you about those iwhen he realized that something was wrong sam had taken the phone away from his ear and opened up this recording ap in case i needed some kind of evidence or something later he is extrem ly organized that way and i'm really glad he did it fr one thing i have this bizarely candid portrait of myself now in the moment exactly after one of the worst things that is ever happened in mey yell it took a while fror me to mye to listen to it i and you ot ot g i'm used to hearing my voice recorded and controlling the way i sound the way i'm talking to you right now but this was some unidden child creature bubbling up from my throat when i listen to it is i've finally taken some mask off and i did not know i was wearing in ti cu pitting on the head an that i ell in a i cre mi up up o bi but i i o a titi it in't get anything wer the i ti a ter han o a cery ye ucki cri acury but your i yo could know i mine i a pay ye a an we brou oter ino i mi mactly fn i and this is another thing this kind of incantation i keep repeating wher and fine a'm fine instead of telling sam what did happen i spend most of the call focussing on how bad it could have been on te word it is i'm clinging to a booy in the ocean after a ship rak i could hav been lot word he i could ave been a lot word a ot my wat o we but i mean i mi mine im a pay im o ca u e coutd ave been away wor onwy mine a e an i never say things could be worse almost every other time in my life has been better than this one and yet most of the time i just broed about what is going wrong or what i wish i'd done differently but here i was clearly just paving over all the broken glass of what happen to me immediately counting my blessings and a way i'm never usually able to and of course it could have been way worse truly catastrophic things happen to people all over the world every day i remember talking o sam for forty five minutes it was actualy about twelve minutes which i could not believe s were's the rest of it by manute six six minutes after the attack we are already starting to laugh about stuff i told hem that i had been heading down to my car to get a pack of cigarettes he says youn while i gess lo killiam it is good to know we were able to talk about it that quickly it makes a lot of bad things seem more survivable we spend much time trying to control how were seen by other people but sometimes we can catch an unexpected glimpse of ourselves that we have not mana cured and that has waymore information in it about how we actually are mi not be the funnest thing to witness but at least we know and to day show we got two stories in which that happens two different people seeing themselves in the wild and what it confirms or does not bout who they think they are stay with us he o i ot awak ye on e n act one you do not have to be a star to be in my show i want to tell youabout my friend zac's first big break zac mac dermat we are pretty different people zacts from which o ta and he has this kind of macho cansin self certainty about him on the surface i do an impression of him that i finally broke out when we were hanging with each other a couple of months ago i'm i'm a writer i i rn able to get gusted up for yo i was not expectin youd a bit to lookin a faire lark e git pretty good bhe flotters mbe agreed you why i yu do not think youu do impressions of people less you kind of really them or do not them at all or if be superdo not theright and i feelt you more superlike me i superly you zac is this singular tombination of things i really have not encountered before as well as being swaggery he can also be awkward and vulnerable he is conspicuously caring for the people he care about after myself he made me promise i'd call him in the middle of the nignht if i needed to hes spen about seven years working as a public tofemder for the legalade societyes new york zsometimes juggling more than sixty cases righteously indignet about the court system he is always giving advice but he also needs to be reassured alot and he really likes other people's attention he is always watching himself in ways both literal and not which anyway brings me to the story of the big brakes see about ten years ago when he was still a public defender zac was also trying to make it as a commedian grinding away sometimes doing four or five open mik's a night his ac was pretty in tense bac then he had a mohawk and frank zap o moustache and jaspatch one time he came out on stage just shouting lyric from the rapper which he mame i usually record his set just with tha little vidio camera or fone and he also had this friend who was always egging him on sort of repping him in a way zac always refers to him just as the producer he does not want me to say who the gay is but he is famous adjasent ran with a really heavy crowd and apparently he had big dreams for zac's future it was oh yet no worry i kno hova do not worry i know you be found do not worry i know othas jasy yet meedin't all these people with him and him telling you you are my brojac men i'm put in everything behind you n woing to puton my money behind you an going to puton my connecs bind you your you are next trust me when i push the button it is going to go fast they worked on a pilot for a tevy show together held a casting call for the roll of zac's groll friend collected headshots did screen tests the whole thing and then in the fall of two thousand nine zac found himself walking out of his apartment building and on to the set of a tevy pilot in which he was the star everything just looked perfect a coat commercial it was a gorgeous day efall day new york sonny there was a realistic amount of people on the street but not many that the scene is going to look rushhour cause it was not it was the middle of the day should look the middle of the day and every one as also just a little too attractive actors everyone i do not have adio of this because it was never actually recorded because it was not a tevy pilot those people on the street were not actors this was not zac's first big break in to show business it was his first big cycotic brak the part of his brain that wanted to be in the spotlight all the time had suddenly exploded zac was experiencing a type of delusion that we talked about a little bit on the show before it is called the truman show delusion not incredibly commen but not as rare as you might think either zaffer is of trement showe delusion basically think therf being filmed ll the time by hidden cameras just the jim carry character in the wobe the triman show in the weeks leading up to the brak zac had been showing signs of this on coming split with reality little hardengersn and bigger ones he would been growing more and more mannat sleeping less and less i had some friends in family start to be concerned about me and i kind it has brusht it all off you do not understand what is going on my brand you do not understand r i comed you do not anstand out to do comey you do not understand u you comedy after your lawyer all that you do not understand out to wriht a joke look its a mathematical clacian let me show you this is a premise this why this is funny this why that is not funny a that is your inner monolag you do not understand and out of monolog heven the producer was concerned told zac he had to go see a doctor if they are when to keep working together and yet when zac walked out of his apartment building on to the street that day he was sure the producer had staged everything just for him in zac was reaty to perform thinking of himself as some high brad of ally g and johnny knock vill i'm thinking my friend the brilliant producer had the sid ed what zac's not really an actor he is not going to know how to act i'm just going a throw hi men somewhere he will eventually get what he supposed to be doing and heels his kind of bastely method act himself he could probably do that i go to toffkan square park soon as i'm in there ah i spit generic old man on park bench tat's what it would say if if he was in the credits yes and he had a bike ah and he was too old to have a bike another tell at the entire neighborhood had been cordoned off to showcase zac's commeetic talens zac thought it would be funny if he grabbed generic old man's pike and did a couple laps around the park with it generic old man did not take kindly to zac trying to grab his bipe away zac relented was surely assigned from the producer keep thanks moving za zac takes off in a spring toward the middle of the park and falts over the wall of this big doggy playpen i get down on all fours myself on my galp with the pact running toward the end of the fence i jump out the other side and mi ara cool whatever that was worth i i did it now money maybe yet hat was muney maybe ou knows and i also was thinking that the pedestrians were extras doubling is production assistance and i'm sposed to follow them follow the foot traffic that will take you where you need to go yo knoone's coming up to me with a clitboard an a shot wister anything nso there then phoning ahead to the producer whatever production younit saying oget he is on first avenue i's almost to house and a you known oki will make him go make him go west then whenever zac tells this story he has a whole menue of deranged things he did that day to talk about ours running around a socrafield with his short s pulled down while the game is going on ordering champagne on a hotel patio and proceeding to yell at the camers in the trees as zac remembers it and zac's memory is all we have to go on this tello vision nonday vew lasted for about ten hours a ten hour narcasisan variety show arranged for him to give the performance of his lives i i sprented across the intersection of then he was hausten and first avenue ah wal cars were mavi o yet that is in credibly dangerous not if its professional drivers on a closed course at its height everything he did was the right thing to be doing he was a master of improvisation following all the cues perfectlay and then he started getting tired and then exhausted everything was still a clue but he was not sure what any of it meant any more somewhere along the way he lost his shirt and allso his sheers and the next thing he knew he was standing on a brooklyn subway platform hands behind his head a captured soldier crying hard he flushed his contacts out of his ives all he wanted was for some one to yell cut thinking to himself coket find you have got your shots cannot you see th i'm bawling cannot you see that i'm here suffering cannot you see that i'm done come out come out wherever you are mister producer i'm crying and i just scream wick wha you walp from me two cops come up there uniforms look real superreal the next thing i recall with any clarity is being in the back of an ambulence ah and eventually i hear radio crack on it zike sh and take a vabableet be you syc wart zac was eventually dignos with by polar disordered type one which can invalpsycosis sometimes in zac's case lack of sleep and daily pot smoking might have triggerd the episode at bel l view he says they dosed him up with anticycotics at times he could barely lift his chinof of his chest he druelled alot he could not go outside zac's only experience with pcych wards before this was as a public defender brepresenting e de peas or emotionally disturbed people and now he was one the delusion that he was on t v lasted in one form er another for the next ten days he saw his mother sindy coming down the hall on da too he was not sure at first if it was her or an actor an prosthetics he calls her bird because the way she snapps her head back and forth sometimes the bird is here she told him the bird camp be here he said bird lives in witchito she said the bird got on a plain it took more than a year and a couple more episotes this before he got stable along the way he figured out a few things had to be good about taking his mets and sleep was key he could not burn the candle at all ends he had been going on stage all the timeso he stopped for the most part haped working his dajop as a lawyer they say you have to be at least a little crazy to be a comedian but it is also possible to be crazy that you cannot be a comediant zac has told the story of this pcychotic break countless times at this point it is a good romp and he is got it down all the different parts tells it entertainingly but while it is one thing to recount something that for memory it is another thing if some one catches it on vitio you can actually see yourself in pcychoses i say this because after zac got better and thought he was totally out of the woods sanity was he did have another cychotic brak and it was captured on vitio and for the first time in his life zan zac would be able to see himself in the midst of trumen show delusion icto thesiram an a stop that and explained what happened after a while zac quit lawyering and decided to try to make it as a writer he wrote a book about that first pcsychotic break and his disorder called gorilla and the bird gerilla is zacenic name caus he is really harry in barrell chestet gan te bird is his mom e wazaption for a tev series before it even came out h beo is planning to run it the director john mark valet who did big little lies on sharp objects is on pure ac an i have had entire conversations about who might play him on the tevsho about the time he thought he was on a tevcho and was not in zac his therapist said to him sort of joking but sort of not you might end up playing yourself on that sho to which zac basicaltle responded yet think they might want to go with one of these aless celebrities their considering and then zac was trying to figere out ways to promote his book and of course these days a lot of authors make vitios when their books come out and zac hired a production crew to shoot footege for he was not sure what a promotional vitio but if it was any good may be they would do a bigger documemory oeu wanted to take them back home with him to witchitot to interview some of the people that he would written about in his memoir meaning his family have the crew follow him around his home town for a wee just rolling on everything documentary style the crew consisted of two professional cameramen and a very season t v producer that zac happen o be friends weyt he would been around cameras a munch before this by the way and did not trigger his disorder the morning the delusion really hit zac had not met up with the film crew yet they were actually wondering where he was he was sposed to call instead he was driving around whitchito by himself in his grandfather's picup he was fighting serious bac pain and he had barely slept in three days again sle aplessness is a huge trigger for his episodes an the book he writes the solution to mania is simple yet hard to come by just sleep and the thing his therapist said came bac to him that john mark valet might want him to play himself on the tvy sho i came to believe that oh my god maybe my therapist was contacted by whoever it maybe i really im addition in for myself right now i i am nodditioning to play the role of my self i'm in the process of an addition yes and i was his testing hat slowly because iwas i be careful you have had this delusion before and you have been wrong and not only that i know how the world works a little bit e i know each beo is not just yet let him play himself a great idea i no but s i do not know you director's kind of crazy i he takes a lot of risks and sitting in the truck he started to have the feeling that in addition to the people he knew would be filming him later that day there were also other cameras that he could not see and maybe oudiorecorders too possibly right there in the truck with him i was listening to a song and his truck and i was kind of dancein a little bit not's at this is kind of funny and iw's maybe ofre not being tapery now i that is quite possible that makes zets was i but maybe you are maybe just give them a little some in to thank about leave them with something o a he is he is gottle something that he is wrand he need's a training but we got something we can possibly work with you once again the powers that bee had spotted zac's late in talent and sett it up he could just do his thing in the wild wow the crowd wo two much of it dou if we must hit is what'h the vidio thiss gunne hurt really i think ho co wel i think i'm min a fel bed for the dutoman watch who is me to of vieo it starts with the production crew in their car without zac it is just one cameraman and zac's tevy producer friend jay theyre heading to a talko shop to mee zac they pulle up to a standalone building surrounded by a big parking lie and they arrive at the same time as zac's family friend rob and olderguy with a white beard and a tanball cap e cameraman's walking around the side of the ta o place and there you are n a man ye zacsin a spider man crouch with his hands on the ground staring down is wearing in a detist teashert and sweat pan no glasses he dropped them somewhere which means he cannot see anything hes clearly in a lot of physical pain it is his back in it spasming i'm on my hands in nees now i'm trying to stand up i cannot be desrans are asking a foror gay my frend day saying hese o gayse o gay it was not one hundred per cent clear what was going on with zac thac tint and jane the others were trying to help him to get him into a car he could get back to his hotel and sleep tut they also kept filming because that was the entire goll of the weep and they thought zac might want this footedge this is exactly what his book was about and here it was happening zac meanwhile was now pretty convinced he was additioning to play the roll of himself on the tevy show that again he is actually being produced about the ti im he thought he was on a tivy sho some blurry calculus told him that his producer friend jay and john mark valet must be in communication somehow in the video zacs on his knees swaying back and forth in front of the tacko stand he closes his eyes then opens them and looks toward the camera the one that is not there and i'm saying too much too much it was freeky to see my friend this it seem people in the park were on the subwat acting zac was that day they are just literally lost and do not know it but it it is the right beside you on the sidewalk and also in a forest that they cannot be guided out of not easily but in this case zac was sitting next to me watching with me and he remembers everything that was going through his head at that moment i came to believe that through some combination of john mark and my friend hear je producer that we had may be a yoga instructor who was watching my movements and could tell by the way i was moving how much payin i was in and where i was and pain oh how i i think i thought therare even shocking my spine somehow thos back spasams he thought they were electrical shocks being triggered by this magical imaginary yoga instructor he moves in and out of different yogoposes on the ground and i think it there thinking that if we shocked him this way he would not ly move his body to correct his posture that well leve his paing but it can also point him toward whatever camera was capturing the particular footag thoug was going to be sent to john mark valet the real director of the real series girrill in the bird o i see it was both to help you and also for production valus right and when not you see me wavin my hand and waving them off yat means i'm not good a now i do not really want to be shot but you are not saying stop filming too the person whos filming this no you are saying that too the larger production te that does not exist which when you think about it takes a certain type of genius because zac's original delusion that he was being followed around by cameras had come true his brain had to come up with a second levele ilusion that again involved real people the way he explained it to me it is not he forgets reality ore hallucinates at the camera's relly the dragon or something he is able to take in all the data in front of him it is just that he comes to the wrong conclusions about it o you tha at that finally zac makes it to his feet and then walks off to the middle of the parking lon sticks his hand in the air and again says to much too much too much wait too much and then he is back down on his knees and finally on his back lying in the parking lot as cars passim zac was right about what he said before that it was going a hurt to watch this i think i'm cind of just wwo i think i'm jus bracing myself for it the whole time and m kind of ruten for the guy and feeling bad for him in puc oh please stop oh please stop but in the same way i would feel bad for some one i saw on the street was yelling at pigeon srin or whatever the differences i know that guy a little better the guy that we saw in he vidio little vette i do illfinally they managed to get zac back to his hotell an this is when we learne about a whole other side of psycotic zac when that is even harder for saying zac to watch robstays behind and the cast is now ja the tivy producer friend and now two cammermen trever and tyler the wen got all of izacs stuff from his mom's house where he would been staying earlier his medication in his clothes in everything and they roll up hi zac's hotel room door with one of those standard issue luggage carts zacs in te room talking to his mom on speaker found jac one is to get an out of an into zac to put him to sleep they also keep shooting he opens the door and they are two cammers pointing at him o i oh o wis her an ere inn sun glasses and a towel i ta i's conge west has answered the door here zac was about to take a shower and he needed to see the sun glasses or prescription j had his regular minders i i i i me jus o yer i t a i'm ind of hammered it up there let me go here andon let you turn that corner an you doing a voice i copanitte wil last is o ets i i ol zac's pretty disordience at at this point his mom the bird chimes in on speaker fron sometimes trying to talk him down and even those zacs discombobulated about almost everything he still thinks he is playing a roll even if that roll is himself the blinking red light in his head is still on all the while ja is being really carying toward him i i o wo shockd i let ealy an figuratively i os usplay o o ja was about to say something by all of this display of generosity and carrying s but of course zac means he was being shocked by a magical yoga instructor nd his also amazed at all f the planting that went into the agishen a us ii o n o i a i did you say let us quit acting i can cocoanat oil my hand whit is i ges if you think you are acting an some one stolming you in you are acting cocoanot oil not ask now are you are literally cocoanut oiling your es yes i thought i thought there was a uphamism no i do ja were my ro glass is gein i ii oar on orders li a re ask hole and take it off take it off speager i'm kind of be in an over al beet here it is true with the cocoanut oil zac comes out of the bat from at one point with the jar and asks if some one can put some on its back re this is probably the cringiest moment of the whole vitio for zack to watch mostly because ezac in the vitio does not have any problem bossing iv e one around trever puts his cammer down and complies jus tep a littlsn s yes wat ere yer do not ton't rob it o har then o is is all right whic jis morsterize na wi o o n ar no o ar no s i i got ro on ye lar e o i can hear you no i jus i o just oilan o i say i'm i tats at i stop not foin you yeleks tops tot nows my good you are not putting cocanut oil on my back right ye us ro us nowja is doing hit not li a us lie a botlas i i ri but us rolishon that is really beingf to watch its jus i'm bein such a big tit to everybody well your yer in o florid zi cogt a up is it that is true but i'm still not bein nice and no one then knows me all that well i mean ja knows me best at this poin here but this is the first he is seen me be in any sort of bad mental sthiy and he is got kids at om hos got a new born and he e he took time out of his scadul to come to this to free and h is taking care of me he is baby said a new kind ye and he is hiding his exasperation while he deals with me but then you can see when he is looking at the camera i will not call it iroly buts is the guis obviously frustrated being pushed to the limits of his fasions he is doing everything perfect here i it is amazing what he is doing and when i see that vidio it makes me want o call je my friend in the vit y do not say hay man i'm sorry i spoke to you that and i'm sorry that i brought that stress into your life but then on the other side of my mouth i'll preach to the general public are not your fault when he does speaking events at book stores and other places talking about his disorder he says people shouln't be ashamed of their own mental aimess and their behaviour during episetes this one his montra is always this happends and it is hoket tbecause i do believe this happens and it is o ka as relates to everyone else but when i see have can do myself an that is not o kay man you got a get your shid together a the advan starting to take a fact zact's gtting drowsy he has to fly back to ellay the next day that it is not clear y understands that the bird un sbekerpound has been steadily beating an dround trying to coax him away from the carans the real ones and the imaginary ones nd just get him to go to bed sleep of course is the opposite of performing r i e y you it looks his getting ready to go to sleep he hangs up with his mam but then after everyone leaves he calls her back says to work what the hell just happened she says what do you think happened he says i'm jake gillinhall no she says there is going to be a tevy shoe made out of your book but you are zack you are not messing with me he says nothing happened just now nothing she says you need to sleep your manic i'm just crush that that just happened o me ik in this moment i'm cint of realizing that my mind has betrayed me again yet and i'm just feel falkin stupid and embarrassed i i mean this is this is humiliating and it calsis chaos falter no fault it is i i wish it was easier to be my friend i wish i took up less space and the people that love mees wives i watch the fi i a several more times on my own and i realize that maybe there is this one other thing that is unsettling for sact when he sees the scene in the hotel rim zac told me he does not one o be yon tevy any more he used to but it is clear his delusion still does the zack in the h ll tell room still has this naked unfettered ambition of wanting to perform wanting all the cameras on him it is almost a little kids dream of start up the tell around his waist could just as easily be tied around his neck superhero stile and the zac watching the vidio is bashful about that in a way that the zac in the vitio is not i an' thing to ask him about this when we were watching it together i called him later and set it on the phone ya i o y o o it omo why i hawo re now thehal in my normal bi ay i mak it r tou ame ordom a yet you an mi it you gon no you you would not o anybody we al your own ra wa you want a e our performer y er yabo my a what te the e bia but it is sort of same zac set the stage for delusional zac to get what he wants to be the star and now that there is vitio of it same zac has to confront what that show actually looks the zac thon and he is not af fan the full title of zac's book is gorilla and the bird a memoir of madness an a mother's love i could talk about how great an hlarious an important i think it is but i've already annoyed a lot of people doing that see for yourself coming ut that one mistake that wants hou you just cant get over it and then you watch the samesgrow up happen all over again four decades later that is in a minute from chicago public radio when our programme continues it is this american life i'm shon coll in for i were glass to days show seeing yourself in the wild stories of people who get too get to reluctantly deside to come face to face with an unededed version of who they are and what they do with that information and i am now delighted to bring you it two of our show at too distant replay the stories about a man who is been reliving this one moment from his life over and over again he remembers every last detail of how it felt how it changed his life and then forty years later some one shows up with a recorting of that thing e manual berry explains the man is my dat and the thing he can not let go of is a high school baskball game from nineteen seventy eight i found out about the game when i was a kid my mom had save this old newspaper clipping or maybe it was a year buck but either way there is this picture of my dad on a baskabalt court and when i brought it to her she told me not to ask my dad about it and i never brought it up but it bugged me because baskaball is the one thing my dad a ni share of my for siblings i'm the only one who fell for the game my dad i loved being on the court the sound of squeaking shoes creaking floors the way the entiour space of the gim would bibrade the way my body would twist and turn im pipot to the basket i loved baskaball but i also loved the attention my dad gave me because of it in the carfter games we would annoyd hell out of the rest tor my family by dissecting my every move figgering out what i could improve on what i did well it was we were speaking our own language together we laid out big dreams for my future club teames high school star college the w en b a the when i got to high school i cared less about the game ir post game talk stopped feeling conversations and started sounding lectures i started to dread the carwride's home and there is one ride for my junior year of high school that i still think about all the time as walking to my dad's car after the game and as soon as i closed the door it started why did not you do this you need to do this how could you do this as i listened to the study rorthem of my dad's cretique i realize these lectures wern about me or what i wanted they were about him i did something i had never done before shut the fuck up i shouted he was taken aback for a moment and then stony silence waiting for an apology but it was an apology i would not give i told him that i did not want to talk about basketwall with him any more if that is all he wanto talk about we did not need to talk we did not for over a year we barely spoke to each other ta lot of time has passed iavee'n picked up a baln for ever either has my dad the silence has long gone but there is something that has not been repaired nowadays we just exchange baskwall pleasantries did you watch that game how does a team look this year le bron le bron le bron baskewll gives us the illusion that we know each other but i'm not sure we do and i've been wanting to know my dad better to talk to him about something real something that matters to hin that high school basketwall game from nineteen seventy eight seems a good place to start iv visited my parents in mich igain and when i walk into the living room of course is a college basketwal game on in the background my dads in his usual position sunken into his refiner even sitting down he still big long arms his hands make the remote look teemy i ask him to talk upstairs o you here ery eresolt wat iho o he we i'm nervous my dad is intimidating we choud chat for a

was cruising through the seasin to the state play offs which brings us to the game i was never supposed to ask about it was a summy finals the team was pos to where suits to the game but my dad did not have one i had to get one at the last minute he missed the peprally and he got to the gim late my dad remembers going to the locke room the starting line ups being announced and when the game started he says he just felt off he remembers is one play in particular where he says everything fell apart i gereve ree bou off to bag wort abot the rail and i go up abot te mai to where bacically i'll i had to du to strup aball in a bask it its stad at through it across to bes andn now well forget it as jus it was hard on me because i was a turn in poin in a game that it may he seel that i lost a game how long do you think you carried aroun that one little moment it still caried r ovishly upsti uc ait what do you think would make you not carry it around with you i don i cannot go byt in time and we do it they lost the game by just a few points did it feel opportunities for closing for you wouth that game yes it we have at a play better we would one a game we would ae been in a finese and ther would ae been more tid iys on us and ut thing was is dat i'l was only opt theare for one yer because a came up here in my seeing a year no bety really knew who i was for me to get the more exposure we need to conchang it to on an won we didn' wan at thing its jus ilot at opportunities for me to be seen when ot to onedow i have a lot of its tit an about they opportunitiye that i feelt that it could a change my and some way we are now when my dad says where we are now he means no college degree a career managing restaurants raising five kids and making ends me where we are now is missing part of a lung and slipped us where we are now is no kidneys and dialysis while still working sixty our weeks it is been over forty years since he miss that shot maybe that is how long it takes to mourn in alternative universe thut pardon me also wonders is not that long enough to let it go to see that it is just a game that where we are now is also forty years of marriage and kids he went to college when even to yale not me and it is not my dad hates his job i've never thought of our life is anything other than a good one i got it in my head that if he could watch the game he would see things differently maybe he did not play badly maybe he is just being hard on himself and i wanted to see it i've never seen him play i looked for the tape everywhere his high school teevy stations the michigan high school letic association and then a few ments later my dad reconnected with one of his high school teamates and he said i have a copy of the game and not only that but he in the other guises on the team had a different take of how my dad plate they said they remembered him playing great that he is a reason that even stayed in the game he gave the tape to my dad my dd tried to watch at once but did not get too far a few weeks ago we sat down in the living room to watch the game together i ready i think yon think are you werry ree now nevs why it wany nervous about watch in myself fortteers yo go pla askumo we busitin knows moment but my tea make said that i play very a bear or beast whatever oh iwill to see that partat a bid yo firs is what i perceive that i did that play very well from mat respective howill i to see that erson the beast the beast the mississippi slammer now i take anything here ou go a grainy black in white court comes into cocas player is sume towards the basket and lay a blinds lots of them have afros an yel whatch wanted me am not yet well it is all over the place then i see him it is his body language my little brothers that it gives him away missus masshoning is that yer yes as me he is sporting a white dersy and teany tight white shorts that are very shy of his knees teapsocks and high top sneakers the shoes make me cringe ankles support apparently was not a thing and he is ways skinnier than i've ever known him it is teamy yall hunedy ni coundme wiets you were undr eighty da an is you iit the teams line up at the big ass at half court for the jump ball my dad loses the jump he other team picks the blt on the court fires off a quick jumper that bounces off the rim my dad'steam takes the ball down and throws up a shot and also misses my dad graps the rebound bobby berry that is my dad the funny thing is that as he watches he seems to forget that he knows how thi game ends and he is watching it any other game on te come op my dad's teams scores the first two baskets it is for nothing but the lea does not seem to matter to him he is already down on himself what do you saeing right now me standin yet no what do you mean im i do not go to the ball i goll wat from a ball watch to ball come to thisid now watch were a go ots asadenable i start to say things it is just started it is all that bad and pointing out every good thing he does look he just got an off and to rebound and i'm busy talking i almost miss the play that is haunted my yat he goei thaayet a was the shot you ant no gou strall the best not always suited me wants us enough the play is over quick it is justs the second on the screen and the thing is after that shot his tea mate rebounds the ball and puts it in in other words the miss it did not matter they still score but it did matter to my dad he never really recovers and for the rest of the game he miss e shot after shot tough it is not all bad he makes the monster block on the nexe play thoug watching he barely seems to notice next play down he is falld on the shot he gets too free dress yen re do tat's whon me you made h your three tho i'm mad mister shot to tro feet away i keep trying to get him to see what his teamate saw he well you gets ere up by quite a bit a know that is ta point we lell at haf time it is twenty two twenty one my dad steam is up by one but by the second half it is as if my dad remembers what he is watching and how it ends no more yelling he just sort of sits hand over mouth quiet and this is where i start to think wait it seem mad at me i start to worry that this was a terrible idea this is not cin o make him feel better rather than think about one mistake in a game from forty years ago he can now watch forty minutes of mistakes oathe game remains cliss and i con see what his te mates are saying about him being a beast he is pulling down lots of ree bounds he is the reason there ston in the game but he is not scoring much then in the forth quarter their opponent pulls ahead by just a few an my dad steem cannot catch up it is over the camer shows one final moment of my dad it seems in on him before he heads into the wockeroom he leans down wrapping his arms around his coach consoling him my father at the kitchen table has far less compassion for himself how are you feeling you to prest but i cannot do anything abaut it is u said is a sad to see that game over again miss sor sure and i did not still i feell the same way i felt then i did not play very well the way i felt that i shuld my dad finally got to see how this moment actually looked from the outside and it did not change anything for him you cannot imagine that things were different the tapes proves the way i felt that i pla is what the take shos when we were watching i worried that i'd upset my dad i had what you reopen in a wam me yes why making me watch is game os it make you that upset i'm not apsad it is reopens it and we making me visit it is notjus sehe i teetn my hope was that by watching it it would make you feel better you could let go of it o on the way i proter can never let go oat t is go back in a time and reversarything is that not your letter would take i think that is rather what it would take i think it it makes me upset that you feel upset or that you feel depressed about this cause it just i knows just a gan it just as ot as other just a game it is just that it long ago and that oh yet i me it is thad in my life i am very i'm very bless in happy ma well that is it though that is exactly it just feels this is such an insignificant thing to all of the great shit that you have going on in your life wach to language siy my dad did point out one positive thing in the vitio that i could not have noticed wht i sit in my coach whent you sat on sarsr hat were you sorry for tose in a gane no i go i dimat ave an ever told me bat what i sit in my coach what did he say back now you play yun at this point we have been talking for close to an hour and i realize what i'm doing isnat working i'm een keeping things positive p ind to make my dad see something else sugar coating it and you knw what i hate i hate when people sugar coat things the truth was he was right he did not play well that dunk he really did pass the ball over the ram instead of just dropping it in after that he only scored three points he played exactly the way he told me not to play for most of my baskewhall career ha yout around theabasketd hands down he mist easy put backs he did re bound well but without him is an thrat off ansivly to teem suffered i think he is absolutely rights if he would played better they would have won maybe what he needed was not to see himself differently what he needed was for someone to see him just the way he is i mean to be frank it was not a great came for you wat n godt was ar wardi but i wanted you to oso see your self wa basslon i think i was hoping that it would be different then you imagined i would you think cause i always imagine that i played lick shit do not tat ta iou see we chatted a little longer i dat looking drained i think a little sad it was late in the rafters were about to play the box i left my dad to watch his game i spent the evening pretending to read but really i was worried about what i just did the next morning my dad told me he had something he wanted to say i actually felt te sin really rat ter watching a game would you i do not think i would watchd it sha srue did not true that wit some one that you cure and for theem to si there and watching tos be druly onest yo sit u but youi ship i she is my language but those things are important and that is what i wanted to talked to my dad about the important things and sunds i started this conversation

andeu thomas normy lives in saint paul but he is one of these doctors and nurses who food in new york to help with flood of coved patients who filled newl hospitals he is actually the hospital combe university where he went to medical school a quarter century ago an night after is twelve hour shifts he sleeps in his old dormitory literally in the dorn room he had when he was twenty three the hospital scratched out all kinds of extr space for covered patients covrating twenty four operating rooms into intentsive carry units but the strangest thing to him normally there be family all over the place but the families are not able to come close to the hospital we ga even com in to the lobby that lobject to see the people they lov avery other figures ius to reality that most of these people can die a in these places alone most of them re unconscious en medically induce comas caus hes you to survive on a venaater that way bbecause they'e unconscieus it means that the gap between these covered patients in thei families is even more profound as did dn't talk on the phone or face time or anything stranger suggested to the nurses that maybe they should take notes each day little things they knowis about each patient to share with the families of the patient dies i asked him to eterfeel sure am this one ome a nurse name sandy and she rode a miss is once o the name ah the patient is mostly sleeping she looks peaceful also i really her dark reed fingernail polish i would love to know the name ofk the color a here is another one a ive been parting ah the patients hare to the side i do not know if that is how he wears it but i think it looks good that way also yesterday he got a shave and now he looks yon u here is one more the patient looks peaceful hes sleeping and calm every one is jealous of his salt and pepper hair he looks george cluting right now a docter few of the nurses who are writing these notes and they said that cause the patients are unconscious ther wre ner actions a pretty basic figuring out what to write can be tricky thacter thomases at for sure yes people and at folkis sing on what you can see which is embellishments yearings and haristyles and fingernail polish and all jis trying to empasize that the people are are comfortable that ther ther sleeping the're not in they are not in pain that is something we really want to that almost every all the nurses comment on that it seems oan almost every one and and what your hypabout about how the families would take this my hope is that the families will know that there loved one were being seen as people entreated as people and that they were in alone a as the happen they gather details about the people laying in front of them knowing that the something an eghty per cent chance tht of the run of ventolator with coved they will not live those are the numbers in new york those two things are different in size riting down a few tiny observatients measured against the enormity of death whan that means but sometimes i think that is all you can do and to day in our programme we have two stories were ordinary people rise tof this exact task they look a dath standing there i gantic harifine and they say something and an these stories truly amazing things happen nbebeasy chicago siys american life a mari glass they with us trpaft one really on distance s remember that sunami the japan march twenty eleven giant black waves mwere than thirty feet tall it japan aan a little town called ozuci shot this vidio he ca near knowing a unn all the houses or wase waaan a had hou'd been there for a hundred years thirty minutes it was gone amost wholly flaten zunami and the earthquake the won with it killed six times more people than died nine eleven over nineteen thousand people another twenty five hundred are still missing and the after mass of course family struggled for you at how they woen move forward without the people they love and in that town of otzuci it led to this new non a ricuo is not exactly ret word for this but it something close to that thi thing that people invented to stay connected to the dead one of our producers making me has family in japan and she grew up going back and forth between there and here it yho watchis documentary byt this thing people were doing in o zuci on the japanese newschannel and ch k and got permission for us to play you some exserbs here is meki of all the areas in japan effectede by the sunami ut zucci has one of the highest numbers of misseing people four hundred and twenty one to day it still partly in ruins and partly a construction side as they trid to rebuild the town on higher grounds but a year before that zunami happend this sky name etati sasaki he was already dealing with a loss his cousin had just died and e tatteri was having a hard time figering out how to talk about it he did something pretty in genius he went out and bought an old fashioned phone booth and stock it in his garden it looks an old english style one its square and painted white and has hi's glass window panes inside is a black rodery phone resting on a wood shelf this phone connected to nowhere it did not work at all thut that did not matter to e tato he just needed a place for he felt he could talk to his cousin a places where he could eir out its greef and putting an old phone booth in his garden which sits on this little windy hill overlooking the pacific ocean it felt a perfect solucean through rno moro te to cosevan because my thoughts could not be relaved over a regular phone line i wanted them to be carried on the wind through the cthrog i named it the wind telephone casi no danla the idea of keeping up a relationship with the dead is not such a strange one in japan the line between our world and ther world is thin lots of families keep a boodhist altar for their dad relatives in the living room my uncle has one for our family there are phodos on a little platform and every day he leaves fresh frut and rice for them lights in cense and rings he ball the way to stand touch to let them know that theyre still a big part of our family after that zunamin earthquake happen word got out about etatos special wind telephone that he was using it as another way to stay connected to the dead soon people started showing ap brandidly on his property and walking right into the phone booth this has ben going on for five years now he tato estimates that thousands of people from all over japan have come to use his phone a tedi station assi tado and the people who come to use his phone if they could vidiotape their calls from a distance and put an audio recorter in the phone booth they wanted to get a sense of how people are still grieving i watch their documentary after the fifth anniversary of the sunami back in march that whole week all the newsprograms in japan were airing memorial programs but i found the calls in this particular program remarkable and moving for just how simple they were one woman from ozuci name sichiko o ckaa showed up one afternoon she seventy one years old and lost her husband in the sunami she regularly brings her two young grandsons to the phone booth and you can tell by how casually they talk to him on the phone they squipt into the one booth with heir grandma wearing matching blue in black strike shirts sichiko starts the call by picking up the receiver and saying hallo i wa w ye hurld hist grandson quickly jumpson a high grandpa o how are you a i'll be in hoorth grave next masther was not that fast ina y dinah my younger brother he will be in second graye next year then csid chiko corrects him she says no dinah will be in second grade this year o w not next oe yet y at this shear a lot of calls were just this straightforward up dates about life the kind of quick highlight thrill you might give to any family number you ere catching up with on the phone the boy he then tells his grandpa a grandmas fine too i'm giving the phone to dinana dina ar his little brother grabs the thone a a grandpa i finished all my homework sichiko urges him to keep talking a u a hes as a every one is doing fine then he hangs up they all sa i aash as ther walking out of toe boot a dina sas maby randple will say he heard us o in another call a woman in a puffy winter jacket with a fur line hood shows up the booth by herself her name is kukuet hidana and she sixty six she is to live a note suci but she moved away after she lost her house and her husband in the sunami her husband was a deep sea fisherman his name was mogi and he used to talk and drink socka together at night now keek away lives alone about fifty miles away but sometimes keek away finds herself driving back to at suci and to thes booth i wast her do this things that a lot of collor seem to do you hear keek away actually diling the rodary f sames the numbers to herself for too five seven for for she is dalling the phoe number for her old house in at suchi the last place she knew to reach her husband then kee away jus stands in the booth in silence holding the phone to her ear sometimes she fidgets around and tilts her hat up and concentrate fon the seiling the same way i do when i want a cry but i'm trying hard not to it does not work keikaway brushes in tears off her face eventually she hangs up she lingers in the booth a little longer hands clasped together in front of her the staring at the phone booth floor she walks out one pattern that the owner of the phone booth itato has noticed over the ears is that more men than women come to use it not surprisingly this is not a demographic that is known for sharing their feelings e specially the older farmers therety have a reputation for not talking much in one of the phone calls recorded in winter a man with gray hair and a little towe hanging around his neck walks into the garden the kind of towelis part of the uniform of japanese farmers the use thend a wipe away swet and cleang their hands thes man opens the telephone booth door and under his breath you hear him say ha this is the wind telephone this appears that he his very first visit to the phone booth he lost his oldthe son in the sunami his son's name was nob uki he also lost his house and had to move in the temporary housing with his wive and recently she got sick and also passed away he calls her bocason it means mam and japanese it is what everyone in the family calls a female head of the house even the husband it is a very intimate loving term w a you hello weki nubyuki a o wen is mam with you c a a a a o wt sorry to ask thus but take care of her and your grandman grandpa sre a a mam e o i'll come again okt a a mam a e o i'll be back a a by huses the tall around his nack to wipe his ives one of the things that makes these call poignant to me is all the understated ways that people are actually saying i love you and i miss you i never say something direct that in japanese it is just not done i've only seen people say on the boperas i schtido even saying that way now feels weird i've never sai that to my mam or my grand parents take this call it is winter the phone doth the surrounded by snow o you yin hello a cmam e o where are you he is an older man wearing a baseball cap he also calls his wife mam his wife daughter and mother they all went missing in the sunami co ca e o e ea it is cold but you are not getting cold are you o on o m con we yo a our grandma and our daughter muki with you too a you t co you come back soon ma ar you we caon o i ci be found soon every one is waiting for you ma o ket a yo ar yo a you we ca e ca c call we found soon hurry home o ket ma o o o o coe co i'll build the house in the same place a oon on e co e e gin beet something anything goe o e a co you o just be alive somewhere anywhere i you yo i'm lonely he never says i love you directly real feelings are communicated through small gestures especially one of con cern they when he asked his wife are you staying warm are you eating and then promising i'll build a house for us these aure total heartfelt declarations of love ca i for other men the phone booth is a place for they can finely say their complicated feelings out loud they can voice their regrets anyone has had some one close to them die nows his feeling bic i've kept having the same one way conversation with my d had in my head ever since he passed away last year i just keep telling him all the situations where i wish i had been kinder more patient one calli watched was from a young father with rec tangle glasses and a long black jacket he lost his family both parents his wife and he was mine and one year old son named you say odad coo mon a o mine ye say og it is ready been five years since the disaster o go oso if thi voice reaches you please lesten eon gogogoer sometimes i do not knowhat i'm living for e say plese let me hear you com papa a e even thow i built a new howogot dad man saig mineme you say he without all of you it is meaningless an yeo i want to hear your reply but i cannot hear anything hangs o on takes off is glasses and covers his eyes with his hands sarry an sorry i could not save you there is a couple phrases i heard callers tell the dead again and again she'm by she ni do not worry about us and gom batde do which basically means i'm doing my very best i'm enduring in japan gomebat de do it is a catch all slogan for slogging through life's many challenges no matter how tiny youre bay from trying to pass a testiv school to grieving you hearedall the time for everything in the phone booth gome batedo and she by she nie tese are key phrases to reassure the dead ut the living he people left behind they are doing no kay even if they are not tpeople do not want to worry or wordin their loved ones even dead loved ones tbecause most japanese ar boothus and generally believe that when some one dides they are not suddenly relieved of all their earthly concerns they are not automatically in heaven happy and care free many people believe that if the dead see a family member suffering they cannot let go of their earthly lide they hesitate to cross to the other side in end up stock in a no man's land i heard these reassurances and a call from a fifteen year old kid name ren cosacki to his dad he arrived at the phone booth after spending four hours on public transportation by himself ren lives in a city much farther north that was not affected as much by the synomi but his dad was a track driver who drove all over japan and in the last minute sceddle change he got sont on a rout that took him along the coast when the pseunamihan he is been missing never since ren went into the phone booth wearing a red back pak and what he does in his cad you hear him signalling to his dad that it is ouet he should keep moving on into the afterworld dad i youn o o the four of us are doing fine o whe're gone back to eso to you you do not be a worry about us she by she nig dad are you

continues ti smar in life mor glass hays programme one last thing before i go stories tere about whethere about what power do words have in the face of death we have rived at acto of our programme act too uncle's keeper in the first act of our programme people kind of defye death by making small talk had thome talk that was not small with their dead relatives in this act somebody once to something very similar make a connection that seemed to possible between people except in this story all the relatives are alive which you think would make it supereasy the story comes from jonathan coldstan ello he dat i johnny hey ha doin good you good good a good yumptiv johna tol oxi mea acter ma what cat i'm not sher hal this is my father buzz i'm calling him at his home in munchreall and the reason were talking crazy talk is because its young kipper the jewish day of atonement which seems as good a day as any to talk with him about forgiveness i'm i wanted to i wanted to ask you something and i just wanted to gage your intrast yet how how would you feel about paying your brother sheldon a visit i have no yeon biam i realyinyoure not no my father buzz is eighty and his brother shelden his only shibling is eighty five and for the past forty years they have pretty much been on the outs my father lives in montreall and sheldan lives in florida and the last time they siw each other over twenty years ago was that their mother's funeral when they had a fight over the details of the arrangements since then they have hardly spoken it worries me because there is not a lot of time left nd i do not want my father to have rgrets and my father has a profound capacity for regret my mother gave up trying to reunite them years ago after many attempts i know that if i do not push him no one else will i'm not surprising not jumping at the idea but i'm a little surprise at yours against the idea ye hav time ca yer co mu e i im repecting not i reve along what he did do was he he called you

felt slighted about having to stay in my father's basement and ill fated trip to new york where my father felt slighted about having to stay in sheldan's attic rude words spoken to each other's wives in one version of tha story sheldon's refusal to bring a table to my brit almost resulted in my being circumcised on an ironing board but in the first a been told to day my father was asked by shelton to pay more than his fair share for their mother's funeral and i can you on working ome kind of an angle not a you got fury you got yor yo got greaming at to o on go to hell drot ded bu a ba yuuld tat

an i im e abrin ote r ide knou there in their eighties shelden and buzz still possess voices and temperament suited to shouting out brokelyn tenement windows while my voice abe ot her is best sue to tasking the waitress if there will be a sharing charge i i aa i casein point this is shelden accidentally swiping a portable microphone receiveer off the kitchen table and me trying to smooth things over ik tes o wi it is anoyin an it is put it in the end in your pocket there just tike e o wit the lac a ye over the next two days my testes will flee frighten cock roaches upward a sending to heights not scene since the barmitzva that shelden was not attending while it is fun watching the reminesse i'd say that about eighty per cent of my uncle shelden stories about the good old days are filthy enough to make them virtually unbrought castable but here is one specially selected and beeped for your delicate years whil he rose wonder what i wil became o him he was a bon men wie ros an wen joyming teway te thing ye see hawa be teste fo ructho e i membe put his hand i tie left and i i rias f ier over the years i've seen my father in the role of husband uncle and grandfather but have never really seen him in the role of younger brother how odd to see it now at eighty he sits beside shelden with this expression i have never seen on his face it is wide eyed sweet and deferential but as the day wears on shelden and buzz begin to squabble over their memories fighting over every little detail remember howlill we had with be e the di head l that heavy sad girl sa ma yers she was ahead on mai yeros no she was a head o heis wohat havn't she went over er even argue over the death of their grandmother ive found om boty i oi it do not know i o my mother was a crosten grin bi mamble wi an in on arm and i knew she was deas was li never saw dead body in ai by nishes ter yr soly to you foundeer you found i remember looking in on a s li i was o ro whi found the bo teim tha non ithi e sung rain the whole afternoon is this every subject even their dead grandmother somehow becomes father for another pissing match there burning up all this time with small talk when what they need is some big talk in particular they need to address a story that i know whoold's a great deal of meaning for my father it took place in nineteen thirty nine on the day their mother left them i've only ever heard the story from my father never from shelden ani as wi you remember when your prespective i wa i remeber at time was won was slack an around an she ran out the hole and a slop finhting in a w he he was slackmackna yet she ran ut yet what happen h next morning tne nax mor er e wn a closet a cloths got she left wa what happened after this in my father's telling is that his mother returned soon after she leath with a policeman an toe and he they came back to try to get yel they wanted you to come back with them and wher were you i was the but you was they were tryng to drink you at ous and a e wn try in ren o they w my father ram this is the point of the story for my father it proves once and for all how his mother loved shelden more than she loved to him shelden did not move out with her and after a year their mother returned and together lesan shelden grew up under the same roof and the same bedroom often sleeping under the same blankets each knowing who the mother had schosen and each having to do their best to carry on and lived life with the burden of that knowledge a couple times during the day i asked them why they have not spoken in long and they both insist maybe out of embarrassment that they do talk just not often but it is not true in fact my father learned of shelden's wife's death many years after the fact and then only from me shelden's dather got en touch through face book and we made a phone date where she caught me up on her life and shelden's and a few nights later while over at my parents for dinner i told my father of his sister in law's death there was a terrible look that fell across his face one of sadness but something else too maybe shock over just how far he and shelden had drifted i i found out habout judy about her death who your yr wife i did not nobod ither co her call me yes i did ni ti you you no bo n we did not know we did not know you was sick obyt to ye you wel wen she go the bi most she was a ready stage for wal i no by cance i o e seron he saii sas well ba tho the sergery on on very well wat the cances an a willen asspread i suthin now wil i said what an o e i me o an o ma o o mo i wa ti o a i in n a texo can for dinner shelden takes us to a local outback stake house as people walked by he provides a running commentary of an elderly couple on ge li that clo watasi i eecugion of an overwaight couple o a e aa a a it is as though he sharpening his wad readyin it is the demain of end teasing my dad about canada a i you te ta camidal an an a i that mi sanah what a sa a aaa a a ther fa an he a a for my father i know this is a touchy subject believing as he always has that sheldan looks down on him for the dinkiness of his canadian life and home it is a constant reminder of just who is second best later my father will repeat shelden's words you still living in that same place he will sigyht for how many years but just then i watch my father clench and unclench his jaw as he does when he is brooding i knowways trying to take the high road trying not to room the evening toane tas i taa aa shelden invites his back to his place for cookies but my father says he is enough for it as aas we walked through the restaurant parking lot to the car my father is silent i find myself feeling protective of him maybe encouraging this trip had been a bad idea only making things worse after midnight lying awake in our hotel my father insisted we stay at one i lay in bed thinking about that day and nineteen thirty nine when my grandmother came back for shelden not my father for my father not only did it push him away from shelden making him feel sealous and resentful but it also cast a shadow over the rest of his life causing him to always feel passed over he is mellowed with age but as a kid i saw it come out in all kinds of ways always sensitive to slights ready for a fight at the smallest perceived defence i wonder if there is a different way from my father to see things if there is the only living person in this world who can help is shelden when their mam left shelden was nine my father five shelden would have understood a lot more than my father yesterday buzs in shelden talk a couple of kids he used to play stickball in the old neighbourhood to day if me in my big fat meddling yap have any sway hey'll have a chance to talk his man as brothers even because if not now when day too this a dam good cigar he sat me deminica repulga than mak a damblet cigar despite the difficulties of last night the coin is flip back to the good side shelden offers my father a cigar and with the cigar some cigar talk some pretty foul cigar talk werid mo queens bullowa jarmin in the backse with the who he is got is mak ee o o meean oman wthe fiing thing we had a stop for a an a a ambo i look a gega did you guis missed each other wat you miss each other an i yes e wes que o tha wowod watis he abroad now i man aninoits eager to prove to my uncle shelden that in spite of the fact i'm wearing my wife's travellteoder and i am indeed not abroad i allowed them to return to more pressing matters there prostates ta e is as your a prasa feels the monrat is in therhais ta you no ann gea tos complimentin if i could steer this away from the prostate it my father said that it significant it to him to have come what do you say i agree wit whatever he si but what about you you i said i agree wi whati at you an o written not i know it feels him getting a taste an what growing up with shelden might have been if you again i make my move i have some questions a just about because it distorys that i know from my father but i'm curious what your take is because you were older do you remember an what what was going on when your mon when your mother last originally what what why and what was going on did not you callin i scroun before yes terday bit for my father'st perspective the way i understood it was always you were the favorite did you did you feel that way at this point shelden's face suddenly softens i spoke the i got the short an tt i tick of the ad than an you or yo wul a kind of a favorite with my mam member wit mam cas may be tompe

swingin what the bot then an lie understandling las a feeling of o resentment and dislike he not was his sma yon fa a communicating with us smack wa smack an ten wat away yet was easier on you you nw i ni was not that he but he was tough on i shel was i know your close a ye e yet i was alot o things at myn an i you unde stand really whil i d o you had a different take why are yo t ere you surprise bi but i was a kid i did not understand it but you did not know that shelen was getting it bad no in buzz's telling their father was always a more or less benin childish figure and capable of expressing his feelings and given to tempera tantrums for buzz it was their mother who was the manipulator the woman who played the brothers off each other but hearing shelden's take it sounds maybe their mother did not come to take shelden because she loved him best but simply because he meeded more protecting from their father for the first time during our tred i can see my father considering shelden's point of view actually taking it in i know it is intense fried because he cannot even meen shelden's eyes instead he looks at me addresses his comments to me you not said that my father a such a negative impct on him yis thortful because he had much going from mewith a wonderful son he worked hard is a good boy you to went to si o a im a faiter an lo you are not a faid tat l an san yo

wivin by myself iyou only show nno the last time my father saw my grandfather in full hell my dad was visiting from canada my grandfather asked my father to drive him to the cemetery to visit his parents grave and once there my grandfather wept inconsolably later that day he would su come to a stroke and shortly after be moved to a nursing home wih sheldan being more local the burden of my grandfather's care fell mainly to shelden it seems a lot of the family's burdens fell to shelden they put a loter to a lot of the responsibility on him that my dad should have been thinking that

i ti i mete e me an il yo ta your m old abrother you's ta not begat of me sometimes but that is the way it is wito wi brothers we yet i was goodin some way someway thi was me who was who as not who is not who is not if you feel you were compelled to see each other now because he knew that it is an our never kind of saying then it means that it was important to you both right to to see each other you wan ta tasi i as olyy answer yes yes gus when i get any younger i wa i what is what is down the road i maintne's eighty five i mean because there was a lot o water on ther bridge and we want ta

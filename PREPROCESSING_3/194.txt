anything wrong the prome without the two lawyers now they crowd tats that the more you say the more you could accidentally being criminating or salriny especially dangerous they say wit there is moments in the demonstration were cossum was nervously stumbling around not to what to say trying to remember paciic under a federal lon the united states lying to a federal agen is a federal offence it is a crime and it is a crime that is being charged since nine eleven this proportionately against mustlems the moment that you have that ineraction with the federal agon let us say i did not remember something dall asks me question oh your friends with cyrus o wer were you last tuesday and i say alh i think we were campin but maybe she spoke the cyrs before and crus tat something different's all of a sudden tere's a dis there is a discrepance either i'm in trouble or cyrus is in trouble and even having that very basic conversation shecause of this he tells the group over and over he says this if the f b i or in why p d comes around asking these general questions it is best to get a lawyer we are not saying never talk to them that is not a wer say wo were saying is do it in a way that is responsible and it is nothing controversal it is what warcs the steward does when she was approached by the efb i should in talked to them directly she resand lawyers he present clinton was under investigation he had it seem of lawyers that is the safe responsible way to do it i it is not being uncooverativ it is actually the most american thing to do this particular workshop happening twenty twelve but clear and other organizations istill give workshops it to day got around to a bunch of lawyers from different group sand i do no i had assumed that twenty years since nine eleven the surveillance of musslem communities would slowed some buthey readdy told me the same thing it is the same to day or greater than it is been in the pass the council in american aslomic relation's office since sudthen california has more cases a lawnforcement knocking up peoples dors pus in addition to that a real explosion and muslem travellers being questioned at the air port when

fasagon that i's hard is about that it is a landmark case about whether the government's actions gathering information or musslem citizens since nine eleven have been constitutional the tactics used by the epi in this particular ca ase a tactics that the often us when they surveil musclen communities using informate last time the f b i publicly stated how many informance it had the number was fifteen thousand ut in a bunch ofways this case is not tickle it is an outlier case wher we can watch everything ga wrong thatch is in the point of view of the people being surveil the informant is in happy haut worked out and we presume the fb cannot be two pleased either for reasons at yo here bount all that likea said it is compelling and very weird case stay with him taan jm rat this happened in orange county california two thousand six an at that point at least one homegrown terrorist had come out of an orange county mosque and gone to work with esoma bingoton was on the f b is most wanted terroris lesk and relations between the f b i and muslems in orange counti californiat were already on edge before this story began on adds that the head of the f b i for los angeles steven tidwell decided the should do a town meeting at a mosque in orange county was the azlomic center of erfine wry said emphatically that the f b i was not moniterying muslem student groups in the area with the mosque itself the crowd did not by this somebody in the audience told tidwell it would be naive for them to believe that the f b was not monitering the mosque every one should understand that they were being moneter he said tid well interrupted wo o o a o moare we wil will weo the mand in the audience replied you will send your agents without anybody knowine a b i we will wor o ren we o wa m that was june fifth two thousand six as besty we can determine people at the mosque and from testimony in coit two months after tidwell reassured them hat the f b i would not monor to them without tywing them the f b i placed an under coverin formant in the mosque this weary story begans san black as our reporter the inforeman in this story is name cragmon tay and a lot of people who gounder cover to catch criminals he used to be a criminal himself he is done time for forging check in bezlmen and grand sett at one point he made a living stealing cocane from drug dealers as i reported this story people who know him described tom as a snake a camelian a thug scamartist and quote a peaceful and crags hays some pretty far fetch things this list of aliusis he told me he used all of these and under cover things italian drugdealer vincsant denado a russian hitman by the name of ivan turnyanko clumbian drugdealer pedreau hernandis a bulgarian drug dealere by the name of sir gi gird also i went by polish names one was a leck dlesky it one clear of any of these are real but some of the unlikely things crag says do check out the fact that he worked on a counter terrors an operation for the f b i the bureau has confirmenes ind he does not sex the f b i enlisted him to go under coger the catch people who recruiting in training terors crag says at all began in a strit mall starbugs wre he met with two f b a agents paul allan and cevenarmstrong he says they told them they wanted to go under coger they would pay him to infultrate the muslen community in orange county which is a unny thought tecause craggs not the most inconspicuous guy i'm six to two hundred sixty pounds it is not fat it is lean body mass i bence five hundred pounds i have twenty one a half inch arms but according to crag the f i wanted to use his lean body mass to their advantage i was too lore muslem mals into the jim yusing my physique i to see what actually is the real pulse of the muslem community they told me what i did was vidal to america's national security and to do exactly what they said and did they have particular target in the muslem community in mind no they said the targets would come to me the fbi i would not talked me fror this story because the operation is still classified and because it is the subject of a lossid but the f b i later confirmed in court the crag was an under cover in formen a district atturney also stated in court the crag did work with agent haven armstrong and that crag had given me fpii quo very very valuable information the ba also confirm one other thing the name of crag's operation operation flex f l e x one thursday in august to thas and six crag shured up at the aslomic center of ervan when the biggest mosques and orange county and met with the emon there cragg told him that he wanted to convert to islon the next day after friday prayers cragg stood on the stage in front of hundreds of people and the clared that he was now a muslem with te new muslen name forruk alases people who were in the mosque that day remember it well the first time they saw this new convert frruk picture a three hundred pound blind backer that has a ridiculously wide frame and an huge massive legs he is bisips wuld just miy my old fy he be sice just he was a big gy at the beginning i was cont aunal consks from him he was kan escanin to meu looking over the next few weeks crag started showing up at the nearby twenty four hour fitness a jim were allow the guises from the ervine mosque would work out and when he was not at the jim he was at the mosque he intended prayer five times a day one of the people who noticed crag was an egyptian gind in imen he asked the not use his last thing every day you would see him in the mevery day yu would see him but he would be sitting alow you do not know if he has friends or if if he is a stroggling to understand what is going on you feel bad this guy he was he is a nutase lam probably either he is afraid or curious or something i do not know hou do not know he just wont to be as as friendly as you can i men lived in the house just around the corner from the mosque with a few other egyptians one day he decided to introduce himself to crag i believe it was of tor of tor the dur pray which is tot one at twone ofclock i went to him and i said they it is ali mo equon a piece upon you basically and hay my name's imen he says been about four weeks right your still here crag remembers this too i say yes he said well yousee people just new converts at a few weeks sagest they leave the fall by the wayside a sowoll not me i ma marillaslem and i told him hee is my number and i do not my number on a piece of paper if you hafe any any question about anything in your head about th ther lision or or if you need anything that can help you wat thi would luft to he said well no where egyptian we get together on them after a crayer on fridays and hough the week an s and we all a a barba to have food together may beon com by will will talk to more about a your faith in how you can grow as a listem from there when i went home i thought im really in craggs in new friend imon lived with four unmarried egyptian men olinder lay twenties early thirties one was not a countin another worked for a legistic's company there was a guy who worked in firmasuticls and an itee consultment the each travelled occasionally sometimes for work or sometimes back home to egypt cragg says his at bihammers suspected the roommates might be a terroro sell that would ranicalize him he arrived at their house ready for anything e first abo they mix ome egyptia food which is very good delicious food and we sell the couch for about ma be cupl of hours s et conversation am and they would play thei expox while were have the conversation in a very competive way i was engaged at the time but but explay more i ex box and spending time was my fe on say it is eighty percent exbox and everything else comes second that' imand again he n his friends were ridiculously obsessed with expox they play turmants for five hours a day and the only played one game ff a acker as he lan we played a lot if he for we still play a lot of fef the aster at delrahem was one of imond's roommates a tall athletic guy who worked as a teck consultment he would lived in the you asked for about ten years the atr and imon considered their house of brotherhood but as he told me in my producer brin read not really the militant teror sel kind crag was looking for we would all just hang out together in ta i lot of my friends would actually canna not come in and say this kind of the frat house riht but obviously we ca drank it a frat house without outcohall a cosher fat house yes craggs plan work th aster and imonds tarted inviting him over more and more they would hang out together get coffee go the movies when crag got sick they went to his house to keep him company they brought him books about islom and brought him back gifts from their trips to egypt here is imon and an yaster whe was he was super cool gy you knont he shape conversation we we talk about sto e was very comfortable round as he was very cool round as he would jok cround he would tell us about what he did some of they ad he was going through he said hewas none through srome our patches from a family perspect im con er defors we tried book to speak and arabic as much whe whe when he is around baus we did not want to gegivhim any feeling that he is un comfortable anything that we would alked about the jim we went worked out together obviously when you see a big bulky guo ou ought it mean that is just that is very wite but y can lat's five pounds we watch t was sometimes o watch aric movis and cause he b be interesting actually seeing some of that we never treated him as an outsideer say he seem one of the boys the crag was at work watching taking notes and recording with a hidden macrophon hey beyond the whole day i would get to my car in my garage i would turn hn device di would say something forruk alasies may fourth two thousand twelve five forty five am and i am hat man is beginning the aftbe i as publicly confirmed that crag recorded alioin vidia during this operation that means presumably the smack the egyptians talk during expox turnments the discussions of movies in their personal lives the exercise tips that cragg gave them at the gim the egyptians would play pick up sacker on the week ends with a bunch of other muslin guises crag went to some of these games but he never played instead cragg says he used the opportunity to jot down license plate numbers and film a game as hamlers could see who associated with whom according to crag he also brought his handlers things from the egyptian's house that might have their deona or finger prints they they struck me to get is i las smoked i cigarette bat from his astre os room and a cer ilers was bath room liket to paste to you would snink around their house and steal these things from their rooms yes meeting iman in asser it was hard to imagine whyn the fbi was matering them they just seem normal gises the f be i of course would not talk about the case and they would not even talking he general way separate from this case about how they choose who they are going to investigate i calld trever erranson to help me make sense of operation flants he isn't investigative journalist whosanalized over five hundred fpi terrorisam convictions looking at how informants are used to fine suspects survail them and build cases i told trever what crag said that the fbe i went into the muslem community without any specific suspects trever said that is possible but it is also possible that crag wasn' told tho the targets were ipossible that the fbi had information that crag is not aware in the cases we have looked at it is really uncommon that the fpi wits then lots of time with someone who was on fruitful y knows is if their spending months and monts and alther doing this playing socker the ft i will move on you knw if crag was spending that much time with them it is worth noting that most likely they had enough for what they call cratiget whch is reason that they were investigating them be ot that they there was a fome call tht was everheard of some con of correspondence with some one over sees on that the fies monitering that made them made at theigen suspicions of this particular group in addition to treveer migt producer and i talkd to five long time fbia agents now retired who all over sine formants they could not commont on operation flect specifically and none of the new first hand about these egyptian guises tut they gave us similar theories masencally they said if the fb a has even the smallest reason to suspect you a reason you might not even be aware of your self they have to check you out maybe you happend to phone some whene the fbs matering maybe they got a bad timp one of the acs af be agean said to me o innicent people get investigated sure every day they cannot weave them out without looking at them though one agent said it was possible that this was a case that just when ary that was badly managed and did not follow fbi prother calls months passed people noticed that rag was acting more tovout he began reciding prayers aloud dressing in traditional robes and showing up early for five an prayers that hed get there before the person who unlockd the mosk every morning they also notice something else its slowly in surely enough some during sometimes o when we hava coffee a came the question of ghat y osser one of the egyptians had actually been asked questions about ghad before non muslems bring it oup with them sometimes lik he will be on the plain in the person next to m will ask about it he and his friends told crag what they always tell people the g hod is not what you see in the news g hod is really by the each persons internal striving to be a good muslem it is not wholy war here is imond thats thet theralit is if am nutlys lam i would be very curtious about these stuff to it would be very curtious about this stuff that is what the media talks about old the time he must be very courteous see n o tha no if yyou mention is lam that i think there was a sarvey if you mench at is lam the second thing that you think about in the ving the america slihty was terrist you knowwe it was for me was somehow normal that he is if you look at it from a cressa curiosity view point but he was'norma how opsist he was with it until dwenat we we start being this guy is a thes something very very tob about this person b he just tod bring these odd things in the middle of the conversation out of nowhere for instance the guise would be talking about food or sports but yet he would always bring politics in the conversation as ye had soside bomber it was what you wane at i for example and being gasting what you wan at eat for wha do you think about hosni mbarac you knowhant i mean he he just out of nowhere cragg talk to his arabic teacher mohamed el c c about his new obsession too bhe invited me once to lunch yes and i he folcus the topic in the lunch about jhat and i i keep i'm i turning his attention into into into the the the the t iscence of his stamman he keep again bringing back toold y hat and kep asking about jad over and over and over and i told him faruk get over it get over tov ici it' alarmed all of them and one point yaser confronted for it is crag i even' told him my cruk this needs thi top because this is not the right direction thi nowt what hi slums about somebody is teaching thi let me know because we ean to correct that immediately ra and did he seem receptiv he did he say he did right and i told him i told him ill at this point people are certainy gad to wonder about what is going on where youre learning thi stuff from mi wanhe tekind understandin is yam on i can talk to any abut about this do not know maybe i was reading somecorrect staff the cragg did not listen he did not stop talking about gehad he says this is what the atbe i wanted because he says he was grat at it i would have to in tha very stritigic way get your views on jehad and the av good at it in their view that they wanted to enhancit i was to speak to iin ten listems to day regarding jehad since the efbei is not commenting i ran this by treverarinson the journalist whos examined about five hundred counter tarriesm cases to see if het was possible he said then all of those hundreds of cases he is never heard of a coil this the ex efbiagents i spoke with hadt either the trever says that once a sthing operation gets going it is common for under coverations and informants the bate suspects by asking him about ghad that happens in almost every under coverstaying operation i can tell you that in many of the cases i've looked at that is mentioned in the criminal av a dafid ave a david in some way and i i think when that submitted at triall that is a really damning piece of evidence i for jerrys to day crag took thi stragy and ran with it mohammed the arabic teacher heard complaints from his friends it was te to to to the limit that one of them told me he called he keeps calling hi by fon and keep sink to him gh g iwas you o waiin a minute he wuld whispered g ha tyain the fon i ask crag do that happen probably i i'm not denying it i may have been wer conversation or something and i had done something ridiculous that but that i don' deny it a i'm sure i probly did o ke but we trn to a complish weth that whatevery individual heard that and they did not quickly report me the i macly a suspect every steal conversation is a conversa sion at the fpia or prasecute iold say well you heard him say this numerous times and get you git into the following that we were trying to do of course if you did not think crgg could get any less suttle here is another tactic he would try i sa letsa withits meat tomorrow after nis e jim will work out together il teacher some things the hodgigger reforms shaped a little better yor yo bysips stronger bigger and at these work outs i would ask very sensitive question regarding is slum for example what do you think about about about e semup aloted iman was working on his byseps when cragg askd in this imlike to it o k some of be leding is a badguy he is that he is a mother i what i mean old what we are suffering for m right now is because it fosemablati you question right now as because it fosemaba that what i m mean all of these new laws that the star acting about just searching we an sticking oe thether thing an you i's because it fosemaba lot he tell him ye is sometin that is by badguit b one day a gin him we ads servty shown up at the jim it tha fram we as had own tho holall c f c slash talcoboul near by crg hopped off his stationary byk and introduced himself to reas as a fellow muslem here is reas that i left i left to go stretch out that i came back and then he he leans to us and then he sais son if i met i met the shake en agh gan istand thus shake the shake sa yet that i met the big ey or the shake a nghgat istand what did you think when he said i we we knew that his refi no son deloted ke was bragging he was a smiling that he met the shake ye i came very clear hit ot to us cragg told us he has never been to afcanstin but he was trying to see if these guyes at the jim who he' never met fot he would be cool to hang out with a sama ben lon they did not think that would be instead read says he want to get cragg to leave him alone every time he saw him he would tell him the dirtiest jokes he could come up with but i lit i don' him till i think iws a gi masen iis feti his goa as too lut to gesinvalv wi something that we were not involved with what did you tell him i did you hear about the doctor who was having secte with his patience and he said no i s e's a very interesting doctor and the he looked at me he is a vegenarian it worked cragg left him alone after that about eight months an operation flx craggs hays his hamlers told him to start talking to people about an actual terroros plot a plan to blow up buildings and southern california that happens in lots enaf be i stings the informant suggests the plot to the suspect not the other way round a cording to treverarinson agan who studied hundreds of terrors am convictions af about five hundred terrs om cases since tot eleven about fifty defendens have been involved in case is where the informant came up with the idea and provided alv the means but exafbi agents i talk to soi that in a well rung operation the informant is not supposed to suggest the plot at the bloom first the suspect would have to declare his intention to commit an acto violence without that the whole case could get thrown out of court as an tratmen the prerson cragg suggested his plot to was a gui name imetineasy the as he is the only person we know of the cragg help catch the only person the ef be i arrested as result of operation flax crag had met inthe as e one night at the ervine mosk mohamed crags arabic teacher introduced them the ashe was a family man very different from the egyptian ex plox players he had a wife and two young kids and taught in a near by language school he as he grew up ent ouf ganistan but he have lived in california for eight years he in cried went out for coffee and the hid it off the star to hanging out a lot sometimes with mohammed one friday the three of them were driving to a mosk where mohammed was scedural to give a sermon he as he did not wanted to an interview for our story but here is mohammed neasy was sitting in the back seat and a fruk was sitting in the passenger and i was driving and here is crag a k a for ruk and as started to bring up nel what what should we really do as muslems now that our brothers son sis o been blown up na ganastan and the rock in is oldin fruk whele living in ervline the most feaceful city and merri is you n why i just do not the way that teno i making government is handing situations you kalitside hemself in was likin oka and what are we supposed to stay here whatch our natural champes should games play exbox everything else while our brothers beeng killed and you stopp talking about som ghan i became very agressive and is lin thruk what ot ys trying to get into exactly i say we should carry out a terrace attack in this country because i'm tired to staying around twith nothing i've got a access to weapons i d'll had do things we should bom something silence was iud day on the car i did not say a word untid we arrive to the mosqu i refused to talk at all i the first thing that came into my mind that i i i thought tatisaa straight shot turrs and at that at that point i i fill conscaps from him he scared me mohammed glance into the rear view mirr and sane asi taring back at him you looke shock crag's head was down he was now playing with his phone no one said anything for the remaining twenty minutes of the ride to the mosque the drive back home was the same after they parted ways with crang mohammed in the as he talked about what had just happened they decided they had to do something they did what all americans are supposed to do in the situation but lan forcemen if fessies tell us we should do when some one says he has access to weapons and wants to use them they reported crie to be f b i as a potential terrorist coming am what happens exactly when you turn in someone to the f b who is working for the f b i sand black story continues in a minute from chicago pubic radio when our programm continues tis american li from yr glass to day's programm the convert the stray of an f b i under cove reparation from two thousand six that wen very badwy is i think a fair way to say it and the uneasy relationship between some muslems in te f b i and why that might be and as i said to the top of the shall we first round to day's program back in twenty twelve and whene weventing at to day because the case that the documents was argued had the suprame corit last month it is tar to say i'm what exactly constitutes failure if your government informant but i think that being turned over to authorities has a possible terrash yourself by the people who you think our terrace that is got to be on the last stride that is not gred sand back pixks up our story where we left off mohammed in the ans he wanted to report crg to the f b but they were not sure who to call or haw to do it they reached at to husam a loush husamas director of the council on american islomic relations in southern california nown is kar and well known member of the muslen community there just hours after the carrade he got a phone call for mohammed here is husam he was terrified i means the ga did not know what to do wit nervous he told me i know you deed wit the f bea and i know you wok with please what do i do know mahammed was with niazi they were both the fraid that if cragwent ahead with his plot they would somehow be responsible he pass the phon to niazi he was also panicking crazy i ma both of them did not know what tus a told him thogry about it cam dam is you are not responsible for anything youre doing the right thing you calling te authorities even if the gay is planning on anything you e you have nothing to worry what you are not accomplices what did you what what did you think was going on when you got this calm ther are three possibilities either he is recruited by cada or his a lon wolf doing things on his own or he is do not get for somebody else as as as an a tropmen either way is bad news musam told mohammed in the azi that he would cell me f bea for years he would been intending monthly meetings with agents who toped to bo th good relationship wifh the muslen community and he wass friends wit steve tibwel heead of the f biees an laaffist whusamad actually organized the outreachd meeting you heard about earlier the one were tibwell pramise that the f pia would not send people in te mosques an announced husam called tibwell on hisseltan and told him what had happened to mohammed in the azi they thought this guy in the car might be seriist again here is husam well you non't thanks husam you you doing the right thing thang these gentlemen this is exactly why were proud of walking with he most some community and theadand i did mention i shots as you kmis a white guy a white convert an ervi said oh that is what he said oh oke thank you hasam that that is thus great in formation and the willwill let what happens sai taway with it do not do not you need his name cause i had his name and i have his address because they did you where he lived he said well dory about it ana we wolk closely with ervin piti and the we will take care from it wold take care of it from from here thor about it i thus thus one my doubts tought it you knon't playing in my heads i felt ther was something strange tibwell would not speak to me for this story i do not know what he thought when his own informent was reported to him as a terrorist but not long after this phone calm the f bei lanched in investigation in te crag which no matter how you look at it was a very strange undertaking f bi agents we are going around asking questions about an f bea in forman treating him as an actual suspect they were investigating fbei special agents not only interviewe mohammed in the azi they also questioned other people who been hanging out with crag i taught to five people who willingly took part in these interviews at the time they thought they were helpin catch a dangerous person mahamed in theazi even when in front of the judge in orange kinny superior court and got a restraining order against crag that he could not come within two hundred yards of the mosque tbut looking back the people the fpii interviewed told me there was something weird about the way the agents were acting through this whole ordeal they just did not seem tat concerned the asir one of the egyptians said thet was not what he imagined would happen when you call in the feds on a possible terrorist my picture in my head as if you go and bring that up it is o let us go it is finde s person let us make sure were stap and ham they would be at his dor immediately sirty car is taa movi styl and i break and let us get this ga that was not reaction i i was not to reactional eer again thut the agents did ask questions about krg how often did he come to the mosqe who else did the hang out with what kinds of things did he say but with the ocer and others they gradually began to ask more personal questions how many times did you talk with fruk about giad what do you things g hd means when did you come did the united states again yaser thes gis know exactly what was gone on they knew he was there informent i think it was just another way for that o kind't get a saynm and talked to them some people were visited by the fia more than once mohammed one day fbi agents surprised am at his house he asked them how the investigation into fruk was going thet told him feruk was the dangerous gy and he would be in trouble soon but mohammed says the agents were there to talk about some one else the as macalld questions about ma nz how much information i know about him i i told my i i do not kow anything about him an as except that he is a person that comes an prining the mountain to mosq and a enormous ough the community i ady knowin before that i i do not know very much information with him they said denol we just want a to collect more information about thath person i told him i i told you what i know about him that is all this was strange for mohammed te azi was the one who would helped him report crag why were the fbgents asking about him by the spring of two dasand seven the f b i had hunmed in on theazi it is unclear exactly why but court records reveal one thing that got their attention one of the ae sisters was married to a man named a mean al hah al hawh was designated as ta terris by the as government he would ellegedly served as a security corneaer for a sama ben ladn and the azi also said things to crag that con cerned th fbea none of craggs recordings have been released we do not know what exactly they talked about but crag gave us dozens of emales theaze sent him bhut mostly articles and link to vidias some of these ar bout con spiracy theories ow nine elevin wasan inside jab others criticized the wars an afkannastan any rach sometimes calling for muslems to rise up against their enemies this you two vidiais the most extreme thing my producer and i found in the emales it is an emon talking about how he supports a sama ben ladn t at be tt i wuld t e at tt a in case he did not get that he said every muslem should be a terroris te aze sent this vidia to an undercover fba informen cragg they said did i hit he jackpot with theazi they called is jackpot even after neaze turned krag in for nearly a year the f b continued to survei n theazi finally two agents came to talk to him after they left the aze immediately called husa me loosh at kar the asry was crying he was he was crying a little kid very fearful and he kept reputing i'm the one who colld if i'm the one ta nowlde trunning on me the leed agent who met with me aze was thomas fropel who handled his case in side the fbia te azi said ropel threatened him told him that the f bi had somethon him told te zi that he would lied to them which is a federal crime at an earlier meeting with af bia agents one of the meetings were nazi thought he was there to help te afbia catch crag here is tu sam and the agent oxhrly told him base on alr interviews with you you have make commons that are not acri and this would be perjury and i feel bad for you but you nots in yourhand you can change all of that if you co operate with us they said you speak wit erbic pushto and darry andand you could be a great asit and helping us it protect the country what tus what i did ot only to work for you and what i saw something bad om to onewho picked up tephonan and report ot thus while we need you here when he dn of gansta they offer him to the n of gansta and they offer the money he saw the no gan goance py on my people i i told yo if i see something bat i'll reporte and then the gad told him i hope you think about it because if you do not we can make your life a living help hat's they said to vis s exactto the gultte gave me cause i wrote to don as you will talking to me thomas ropal confirmed in court that this meeting happened though he did not say that he pressured deazi to work for the afbia but next efpia agents might produce ser and i talk to said it is common to leverige people this again they were not commenting on nazi's case but one retired agent who had more than twenty years experience in the bureau said there are people all over the country being approachd by the afbia and pressured with things they said on tapes he laughed when weasked him about it it was asking a plumber if he used to rench he says it happened at every level of law nforcement he told us quot it sounds a terrible thing gaes but it is the way business is done it is the way the american people get protectet he got a fine people who can lead you to the baggas thomas ropel return with tha grou p of agents and the search wor int they rated nazi's house taking computers and financial documents months later ropell returned again and arrested neazi ut the tecon tin a torty roan on the totan hole er harget thre oro l owner a ia o o a a e eda wia a a e y rag a man wit a li ti er we government charged nezi with emmigration frod in making false statements they said that when neazi applied for you as citizenship he did not mention that his sister was married to a menale hawk even though youre required to disclosed if you have any ties to a designated terrorist they also charged him for using inconsistenfersions of his full name on official forms and for not disclosing two trips he would made to pack as ten years earlier but wats interesting about neai's arrest is what he was not charged with he was not charged with associating with terroris himself he was not charged with plotting an attack and he was not charged for anything he would ever said to crag over the course of months of recorded conversationts still at neazi's bal hearing the prosecutor argued that he was a danger to the community to prove that she called agent thomas ropol to the stand e et oer er yo ropell testified that ta confidential in failment i recorded neazi talking about g had between fifteen and twenty times in addition he said yourso wrs er orsivis r hes ussi ye asswes es usi what oes as ropel went on the judge asked him to clarifi who had brought up these conversations theazi or the informant a yes i arsy he a ia r of course the individual he supposedly instigated the conversations with was kragmonte i asked crag about it did neazi ever instigate this kind of conversation with you no no i did every time cragg has changed his story on this when th azi was arrested in two thousand nine he basiclly said to complete opposite he said theazi recruited him for a terraced operation but crag says now he is telling the truth he says what really happened is that he went after neazi more aggressively than any one theazi wanted a friend and he tolerated krag's g had talk more than most that danybody azi was he try to impress me he is five five or and i i was somewhat intimidating to him he cutted jistin along with what i said he say he wanted to be a partof this but he did not say to me no i do not this very bad to n do when you be recorded did he feel i've got this got his ideologically leaning towards g had what i thought was i can brieag him there he is afraid he lookd that he was scared which is what i wanted him to be and my haders told me tru brint real him in more and he was his cli mesmarize by me i talked to people who know neazi and they backed this out neazi ment toward cragg but at the same time he was inthrawled by him at least until the moment when he and mahammed decided to turn kragg in to the f p e the government kept nazi ander house rest for more than a year with a curfew an an ankle bracelet hen i reached out to neazi for this story he set me a statement it says in part when the f b a agent threatened to make my life the living hell unless i became an informent which i refuse the f b i made true its promis and really did make my life o living hell in the past few years my family and i have been struggling very hard to piece back together our lives the government eventually decided it did not want to pursue neazi's case it filed emotion to dismiss all of the charges operation flax ended without a single known conviction one person did go to jal bell kragmonte six months after crag was reported as a potential terrorist the urvine polece arrested him for a bazaar unrelated crime it turned out that during operation fle he been running a side hustle calming two women out of more than a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in a scheme to traffic human growth formo he met the women at the same gims where he was modering muslins he went to prison for eight months cragg sued the f beye over this claiming the whole thing was part of an fpi drug sting and that his hamlers conspired to have him arrested after he became useless an operation flex ta judge recently through the case out you can probably imagine what operation flex and its aftermath did two relations between the f p i and the moston community nor enge county who saw ma loge the head of care and southern california remembers the moment at neazi's bail hearing when the fpii revealed that cragg was an undercoverin forement whu sam was in the courtroom tis almost a dagger in my back i felt betrayed the whole commun not just me we felt betrayed because we talk about a portnership if you see something reported you suspect e criminal behaviour call the police people were saying why should we do it we got o be the one the talket of the investigation the reality is the never thought of uss for them we were always suspect we were always deemed a suspect or potential ters operation fliks did not just make people suspicious of law inforcement it made them suspicious of each other many people i talk tos ta they stay away from new converente now they ave a hard time believing people are who they say they are here is iman the egyptian gi who first pefriended krag really what they i is they lead everybody that in the moss look trust everybody nobody nobody would talk about it but nobody would yo would see weird looks e loda me people are looking at each other wert i i do not low may be i was sensitive or e know but but i can till tat thou the way they looked at me we just different in one of the most awkward developments of this story the muslin community is now teeming up with kragmonta the council on americanslomic relations care along with the asl u is suing the fpia over operation flaks the government is arguing in response that allowing the case to go forward would reveal state secrets and harm national security kragg is cares primary resource in the case he is now helping the people he used to spy on and he is been apologizing to some of them too he sees them often because he still lives around the corner from the ervine mosqu and works out in the same gim he made a special point of calling yasera dellrehim when the first people he got close to ah i i i detlly appreciate the fact they called rit an that he apologize for it but the damage his done i ow i do not know what to do i reawe do not i now have a fear that i be montered all the time i do not know how you can change that crag's not the only one apologising after neazze's charges were dismissed he went to the court house to retrieve some of the property that the fpia had seized from his house thomas ropel was there the talked for about twenty minutes remember rople is the agent who legisly threaten theazi we later arrested him nd he then testified in court that he was a danger to society i spoke to the court employe who accompanied neazi to this meeting before they laughed ropel went over to neazi an struck his hand he told niazzi that mistakes have been made we are all human he said i'm sorry san lak he the dak mitre fell maker o sit his fone kingdom of silence that marte sawty journalist jaman kachogy is trimming on showtime be xsat earlier this to pein court case that come out of these events was argued last month the sentulation in the case afpiivers is physaga is whether the efpii was spying oe people just because they were musslin which if true would be unconstitutional but the sprame quiet was not hearing arguments on that question at frall this time the quictism has not gotten to that question cause the government is trying to get the case thrown out government says the epii had good reasons to suvail all these people but amount of proper defense and ex lain what those reasons are they would have to reveal secret information state secrets they would compromise national security and the saying that because their state secrets involved the courts should throw out the case entirely the lawyers abringing the suit on behalf of the muscle community an ervine argued before the supreme court the this gos too far they are have to throw out the case there are ways the case can sto move forward one of them there is a law the foreign intelligence surveillance act or fisa they would allow a judge to look at the classified materials the tates secred still would not be public the judge could see them nobody else could and then the judge would come to a decision in the case wore the lawyers say the courts could just let the case proceed without any secret evidence at all just leave that stuff out o the case the bigger principal here in their view is tat there should be away for people to get their day and court even in a case where the government claims there are state secrets if the spring cort does allow the case to go forward the lawyer who argued the case for the muslen community ilen a relan on them said ultimately if they win they wen all the information gathered in the surveillance operation to be destroyed and that is really important to the people in this community they really were upset that the government spied on them while they were just living their lives going to mosk in the morning they are hanging out your yeser aftery m playing expox sa uno fifa with his remains and it is really deeply offensive to people that the government spie got all that information at sitting somewhere in some ditiota

todatihosponserbacks pressve pian thousands my liters already secured there not with they to join them expressi pianzicom fleshmen the easiest moral place to stand is in the middle standing in the middl is comforting it grants you the illusion that you are being even handed that you seen nuansin complexity were others just see black and white it is flattering to be in the middle no one hates your view points enough to make you their opponent and yet you get to stand apart from every one tut tutting both sides when it comes to israel and it is terror supporting enemies the west has for some decades takin precisely that middle position sure israel should be able to defend itself but not too much yes israel has the right to exist but it must make concessions to those who openly seek israel's destruction when israel's enemies pursue the worst atrocities in four generations it is difficult to maintain that position of study neutrality which attacks on israel are chalked up to political differences and shrugged away it turns out that scenes of brutally masscurd children women and men tend to upset the moral stomach but then the stomach settles again all it takes treturn to that sofhisticated neutrality it is a few false platitudes a few comforting lies three of those lies in particular have been provided in significant suppli by the hard left and its allies in the legacy media the first lie is that israel must be warned not to engage in human rights violations we hear this all the time from the president of the united states from the united nations from the president of france from the media the idea is that if israel's leadership is not reminded in the wake of the worst pogrume since the holicost those rude jews might do something shruly evil they mat carpet bom gosthe mat nute the place the purpose of the lie is really simple to get israel to stop defending itself at the first available opportunity see if you warn the world that israel has to be warn not to pursuatrocities and then as nevitably happens in war something awful happens israel can be blamed andthey can quickly be shoved back into the box of moral equivalents vala status quo anty restored of course this lie is a lie and it is a stupidly offensive lie in the same way that it is alie when the unitened nations warns te united states about human rights violations israel is a professional military tit abides by the rules of war it is enemies openly cher the death of cevilians both israels and their own by all rights the entire political and media infera structure ought to be using they'r supposed moral soletion on human rights to conmince come as truly's hostages and protect gosen civilians but of course there is no interest in that the lie must be maintained israel has to be warned about human rights because secretly if it were not from the intervension of the west the jews ul just be commas that is lie number one then there is the second lie thatgh we must all remember of the vaunted peace process yes the two states selution the peace process that was obviously and clearly and openly stated iruds undertaken by oser arphoght in order to provide the jumping off pont ver a genicital war on the jews the peace process that has t ended in the election of commos in the gosis strip the leadership of the palstinian authority and aslomic gehad in the west bank we must of thelie goes remember the two statesolution is just important of course this lie is dangerous too it is dangerous because once again in inevitably places theblame on israel for murder of jews in israel if only the jews had made more concessions other than the partition plan of nineteen forty seven accepted by the jews rejected by the arabs or the egyptian is rally pieceteal of nineteen seventy nine the arab states bloicott egypt afteron warsatout's piece with israel for almos to decket the oslow cords themselves an who brochs two thousand campdavid proposal rejected byasar arphot who then initiated violent terro war resulting in the death of one thousand one hundred eighty for is raelies the gos withdrawl of to thousand five comas was elected and has been launching at terr taxever sence and who omer two thousand eight piece plan rejected outright by machmood abos without acount or offer and even dia trumps called deal of the century rejected before even being seen but the li goes israel must continue to make painful concessions if they do not ju murder is inevitable when jews get killed it is actually the jews fault moral equivalents restored finally there is the third and most comforting ly that antisionism the wish for the destruction or non presents of the state of israel has nothing to dew with antisematism that ly is currently being encourage by the ecquation of antisematism with is lamiphobia this happening all over the place they antisematism we see to nancollece campsis is part and parcel of the antisematism that ended with the slaughter of fifteen hundred jws in the gosa envelop hatred of jews is the driving force behind hatred of israel but an orders restore andy semblance of moral cover for hating israel tyhe have to separate antisematism from antisinism this allows you to hate jews while pretending to just hate israel the easiest way to accomplish this is to down play the obvious reflection between international jew hatred antataxon israel and instead to subsume antisematism under a brauder different rue bric of lack of multi cultural tolerance now this a ly and it is an obvious lie of course ther are occasional acts of targang a muslim and they are nothing the targon of jewsts are not the same category they do not follow the same logic they'are not the same perpetrators they do not occur anywhere nearest frequently they are not spurred by the sort of cycle of violence in the middle east talk the keep hearing about all of these comforting lies are useful in allowing the morally idiotic to atempt to regain a moral highground the at a falsely restored moral equivalent and how eager they are for that moral equivalents how badly they want it how deeply they seek it how many people are itching for some terrible thing to happen in the war s they can blame israel then go right back to israel and its opponents their just the same and as site gets bombd by israel that is a camas sit and some the shrapinal hads the wall of a church and some people get killed and its israel was targaning a church people are looking for the offram this moral equivalents allows for example left is jews to pretend they will not be lumped in with their fellow jews by the intersectional coalition it allows the intersectional to pretend that they are on the side of the righteous even as they make excuses forkamas it allows the international community to continue to pressure israel after the biggest mass murder of jews since again the holiclos never again does an apply after all if the jews in the end are part of the problem and after approximately one week of lobal dispapsia with the evilokamas the world is gradually returning to its steady diet of moral equivale s they are doing with eagerness this is why the york times was excited to run wut the false story of an is really air strike on a hospital believing a genecitle terror group from the jump that stor who o made their life much easier even in their retraction yesterday they aresti claiming the problem was not that they trust a comas but that they just move too fast it was really nok their falltat frall quote the early versions of the coverage and the prominence it receives in a headline news alear ind social mediachelnels relide to havely on claims by camass and did not make clear that those claims could not immediately bar i be verified they are por left readers with an incorrect impression about what was known and how credible the account las says the near times of course the real problem was trusting camas at all but you cannot trustkamas can you the only reason o truskamass from the jump is because again you wish to restore that moral equivalents moral equivalents between a legitimate state that protects its citizens and a terror group that seeks the exstermination of that other state citizens and shields its own rockets with civilians that ends with blood it ends with blood calls for concessions to terrorous scroups end with blood preventing military intervention to protect citizens of the west from terrus ends with blood moral equivalente is a sin standing in the mddle is not e sign of some sort of moral righteousness it is a sign of weakness of mine and lack of moral backbone and just one second we will get to more on these lis because these lives have becomincredibly prevaintishsing them all over the place promoted by everyone from jobidan toborako bama two certain members of the right will get to that momentarily first pure talk recently announce they would alleviate ten million dollars in

really fast realy fast now out just everyone remember after nine eleven it took a couple of years from the narrive to switch through the overrarking evil of a merico and americas roll in the midle eason maybe may be actually been laden was was right maybe was american imperialism the trol it to it'to little wile to get there when it comes to the jews i takes five seconds juws get slaughtered by the way in overwhelmingly piecenic left tistareas of israel in get what way one of the things that that is a mazing about this is that comas could not be clearer and it is advocates could not be clear in who they want to see die and the answer is every jew the people in for example kiboots berry which is one of the places that was completely ravage half the population is dad in kubotzberry in the last israel electioncycle these are not members of lekoot theu're not right wingers about two about three quarters of that kiboots voted for the left wing or far left wing parties in these rail elections it is the equivalent of terrace at tacking the center of san francisco and yet the idea is from uknow all the terapologists that the real reason this his happening is because of the entransigents of the jews orever when the real reason this is happening of course is because the jews have this pesky insistence on not dying on living on breathing it is e kartun that is going around that is fairly accurate that that shows a comas terrorist withthe bom strap to is jrust an a baby saying i want to kill all the jews and then on te other side is beby nutinahu an in the center is the internatural commu saing sit to nitinahu can you met him half way and that is essentially the the statuskuo anty tat we are now reverting to o casso i mention threviglizer the the first big lie is that israel has to constantly be pressure to maintain human rigts when do you see this tusay i'm wondering one has there been one warerd to you crane to vlodmers lensky about preserving human rights one word can you can you name one i cannot can has jobidon ever ever publicly set under any circumstances vlomers lensky your country is under attack by the russians but we have to make sure that you really maintain human rights now have you cranian forces violated human rights in certinicate of course because it to war and tht's what happens but yonsy jobi not there every single day being whale that that is ha those youkranians yen never no they might go crazy yu do not see that ever did you hear that with regard to even american troops in a rock and afganistan the answer of course is notes ure about british troops or french troops who are involved in the colition forces in thse places of course not the only place you over here this lie is with regard to israel as though israel is equivalent with us with it topsition israel this allowis the perverse logic by which you see morons on telivision or terror apologists maskueradias morons on telivision saying things well jews were killed in kubootz veryin faraza but also babies are being incinerated in gaza you mean for completely different reasons meaning yes it is horrible and awful when babies dying gaza and that is all the fault of commass which launch the war and is keeping physically babies in places they should not be keeping the babies as i yesterday clip some dult on british tive suggesting for example that it is it is of no consequencs when israel warns civilians to get out before tits building of coursethat is to catch twenty too that is gket tratet becaue of israel did not warn then itwould bet in trossy butif israel does warn then it still in a trocity 's anotherwords when israel takes precaution to save civilians according to this idiots this obviouslyas because israel does not care about humon rigt but if israel did not give the warning then also is raeled not care about human rights an theis all stupidity and jobiden promotes it because again there is this n n the moral equillencs must be restorts we can all go back to our comforting illusions about how every one in the world things us there are no true barbarians in the world there are not people who seek the act of destruction of the wast in the murder of children we have to were all the same in if only we could sit down a table together and have tea weuld all be best friends ndit is a lie an i's stupid lie and also tenantisymatic lie in the sens at again it equates a moral states which israel is it has a legitimate military that pursues legitimate military goals with a murderous isis gang in comas a notzy group that broad castits own atrocities on telivision and teaches at children that a trocities against jus are an active public good jobidon yesterday g treeted out along these lines and this is again typical jobidon this is the the foreign policy wisdom of the morans bidan said israel has rght to to fenditself we must make sure they have what they need to protect ther people to day and always far the trea should stop right there that is the end of it and if this were britten tha had ben attacked that would be the end of the tweet but it is not it is the jews bidan says at the same time priministern not to nahuan i have discussedhow israel must operate by the laws of or again the implication being that if it were not for jobiton twisting ninto now who is arm he would be going in there with the tanks and just running over kids just for fun which of course is absurd israel abandoned the gozestrip in two thousand five they have undergone dozinds of rounds with thousands of rock it is fired at israel and israel has never engage in the sorts of human rights violations that bidn seems to be implying israel would engagint if yeu were not there kind of youkno masaghing them to stopping quote that means protecting civilians in combat as best they can we cannots ignore the humanity of innicen pasinians who only want to live in peace that is why i secured an agreement for the first shipmen if humanitarian assistance for palsinans civilians and gaza and we cannot give up on a two state solution will get tothe twosdate solution line just one second because again there is no one for israel to negotiate with isral's been trying but again the lie here the implicit lie and it is a lie is that in the and it is cause of is ralian transgen and also these relies thee really mean an if they were not somean if they were not me none of this would be happening and it is complete and utter rubbish it is more on this momentarily first the menshiberisho is supported bhy grand canyun university in a

if it were not for america israel would just be gloves off murdering people borokobama of course does this is wele the barokomami said many many years ago is effect tively antisematic in his approached israel thishas been true since he became president brokabam's the only president american history who tried to deny ade to israel in the middle he tr he literally tried to stop the re supply of iron dome in the middle of a war in two thousand fourteen brokabama stock his administration with people who despise israel despise israel most anti israel presen in my life time barnon not close and it is no sha which again melld with barokobamas anti colonialist world view which isreally a left wingworld view left over from the nineteen sixtes the basic idea being that the west and its tentacles are everywhere and must be fought everywhere there is a shift in how israel's peceived on the far left from nineteen forty it to sixty seven israel was considered actually in anti colonial state becas it had thrown off the british and had aloud the indigenous people of judea namely the jews to return to their home land and then after the jews one in sixty seven the soviet union decided that israel was two pro western and they ginned up this whole new post colonialis nonsence where israel's actually a western colonial occupire which is an amazing swich an time to take nime babrokobama really believes that that' how he tals about the state of israel onrootin basis in fact in a speech that he made while he is present talking about the roots of the state of israel he did not attribute to israel's historic presence he dn't attribute it to ou know jorishistery or jewish presente he tributed all to the holicos meaning israel was a colonial taterad that that is barokobam's mines at he has said virtually nothing about this entire conflict and now he puts out a statement thought on israel and gaza because we needed to hear from him he was successful in the serena was barokobama we need to hear from him he throat clears for a kopple of paragraphs about hawkamasibad right it is been seventeen days since komass launched i terrific attackians israel killing over fourteen hundred is really citizens including defenceless women children in the elderly as i stated ian earlier post israel has a right to defend itself bot bat right in there is the big but as we say bot even as we support israel we should also be clear that how israel prosecutes this fight against komas matters in particular it matters as jobiton has repeatedly emphasize that israelse military strategy abides by international law including those laws that seek to avoid to every extend possible the death or suffering of civilian populations upholding those values is important for its own sake because it is morally jost and reflects our belief in the inherent value of everyday life by the way if you cared abyu any of us the first priority is the destruction of ckommass there the biggest humorius violators on the planet right now and yet i do not see barokabama talking about that sort of stuff he by the way he says that he supports bied ans call for the united the united states tosupport israel in going after komass dismancelling's military capabilities and fasilitating the safe return of hundreds of hossages to teir family but by the way that is not tha imposing komas heu'll notice dis mancelling comasis military capacity but leving them in place to be just fine apparently with barokobama and again israel has to be leverage fift that we have to we have to jo brokams can a stand thers in tupupam all those drels if i do not gom if i need o stop an the just con go on there there can be brotal benan be horrible and then he says this is an enormously difficult task war is always tragic even most carefully plan military operations often put civilians as rest at risk as president byn noted during his recent visit to israel america self has ha times fallen short of our higher values when engaged in war and in the aftermouth of nine eleven us government was not interestin heating the advice of even our allies when it came to steps we took to protect ourselves against all kita now after the systematic masker of his really citizens amasker tha evokes some of the darkes memories of persecution against youis people t's understandable many is raelative demanded their government do whatever it takes to rut out commass o make sure the attax never happen again still again too big botzon in one in one piece still the world is watching closely as events in the region unfull any military stratigy that ignors the human cost could ultimately back fire ah here i and again there it is right thereit is if israel defends itself they are just gin to be planting the seeds for morrant ack tax which means it is really israels fall it is really israels falt in the end if israel goes in two hard and they take out kamas but komas is put too many civiliaons to run its rokets whell all that is gon to do as is him crim or tar against israel then really who is to blame the jews says barokabama because again thes raly governments secision to cut off food water an electricity to a taptive civilian population threatens not only to worse in a groing humanitarrin crises it could further harden palistinian attitudes for generation all the vaunted paliston an attitudes because as we know they are extremely pliable right now and have been for thirty years much pliability much at tempor piece many' pea seeking people who do not exist that is obviously that that is the big priory the birady after the murder of fifteen hundred jews in israel and th cannapping of two hundred is the plyability of the palistonian population by the way israel i got a say the gaza hospitals where the power is still largely on it is a conical over there wish one day of a oil those supposed to last for one day lasted for eight wer nolik eighteen days inder war and still magrically there is still some electricity in northern gaza by the waythere till water in many's why cause israel provided five to ten per cents of all the water in the first place by the way there is still full power and water in the south of gaza the entire purpose of cutting off the water and power in the north is to send people too the south can do military operations in the north but brokabama nows that instead he is just promoting this lie and it goes on and on and on and on and then of course he suggests that the the end of this an it is all the lies at once from barokabama because this is what he does will get to more of barokabama's lies in just one second again trying to set up that moral parady that ends with israel entanguring its own existence and blaming israel for dedjues i ets that momentarily first the october fifteenth tax dedline has just pass a know many of you might be dreading the stress of filing those taxes whill filing your taxes can be a long

complexituition and there is the complexity there is the o much n ant much because standin in the moral mettal allows you to stand with the bad gos while pretendin te're not he says in dealing with what is an extraordinary complex situation where many are in pain and passions are understandably running high all that is need to do our best to put our best values rather than our worst fears on displays that means actively opposing antisemitism in all of its forms everywhere it means rejecting efforts to minnimized the terrible tragedy the ise rally people have just endured notice these rally people not not the jewish people tese raly people as well as the morally bankrupt suggestion that any cause can somehow justify the deliberates slaughter of innocent people it means rejecting anti muslem anti arab or anti palistinian sentiment it means refusing to lump all palistinians with commass or other terros groups it means guarding against de humanizeing language toward the people of goza o get habout this habout none of this has been humanize civiliansa gos are sill civilions and it is comasis fault they are in the way quote it means acknowledging the palstingians have also lived in disputed territories for generations that many of them we are not only displaced when israel was formed but continue to be forcibly displaced by a settler movements that too often has receive tacit or explicitsupport from the israelic ah ah there it is it is the awe thet two states all thi settlers ah all the usual reasons why palistinian desire for is rally extermination is totally fine it is because somebody built a bathleman afrob that is really the problem that palstingan leaders who been willing to make concessions for two states lution of too often had too little to show for their fforts who are these palstingan leaders who been superwilling to make concessions for to stay solution who are they name them serisly name them i'd to hear full list go o you do not have any oh there is a shock and that it is possible for people of good will to champion palistinian rightes and oppose certain is rally government pocies in the west bank an gos without being ansimetic nobody even made the accusation they have to agrovte everythng israel does but you do have to look at reality in the face reality in the face the palcinian authority seeks the destruction of israel they are not shy about this they lie to the weston than an erabic they say what they actually thing which is solidary th comass palsin as lomagyhot is a terrogroup commositay terrogroup i do not understand wh i man i do i know exactluits going on here you got o promote the lie and then of course your first to tomas freedmen and ben roads and all the people who agree with them on the supermoral complexity o the situation which really amounts to israel is to blame and again th that is big line uver one is big line umber one is israel has to be pressur beas if they do notd there iscan a violate him an rights an you can see it from all the usual procoma suspects thout include the venerably stupid ao see a woman with barely one brain sell shammin sheul das not even have two to rub together here it is its war crimes according to alexandra o cozo crtsas straight from the bar inna in brooklyn hama is absolutely engaged in forrithic attacks and every single day at there are wore details on that are released about what occurred on october seven that shocks the hunan consciousness and a and and shocks ar conscience are collected conscience however we do now as well that war crimes do not however constantlhn n are not an appropriate response for other war crimes a work that there ithereis the pure moral equivlences out to war crime you see shootng a baby in the head in the bacst vacar is exactly the same thing as you are aiming at palistonian rocket has been fired bacamas from behind repartment building and ts villains get killed in the prosces of you destroying that rocket lwaunts or behind he partment building same thing to aosy and if we do not encourage thou those those pasky jews and there and there defending themselves ow those human rides violators hergan is seean un gest rule jabrael doing the same exactrisyan israel is trying she says to expel palisonians which is weard since israel withdrew the on by twhat the only vewloman expelled from the gosistrip in last twenty years are jues eight thousand of them forcibly remove from twenty one communities in the gosistrip in two thousand five we hard have the expulsion of palistonians since nineteen forty eight has change the palestonian population in the land of israel and the westbang in the gosestrip from prosiming one point to million to almost seven million people while worst oana cleansing afort of vall time here is a rule gjebrael i mean what is r sabjasti to those contri but also to the politinian we would baticic palou millions probably an bis a definition of acnaclantic if you are allowing racetis to an be neveto antac to the land they belonged to you are basically creating a mato racato crasia country that is yo redy baying the price of te athe raette cris to the only atarn e tat tr trying to aadministration a crushar israel to creat baticly a place where if yureate carab human life at te fac o human life an international law is well is ro is on the ultimat par that condetarmen what what to do with in a racketi oh is israel that has to do it commoss by the way was the en control of this entire area for twenty years but rule jubriel had nothing saye of it nothing zero zip zilch egypt could tate control this entire area and make it into a paradise have they done that no no by the way israel has twenty percent of its citizens ar is raily arab twenty percent of a citizens this this talk of ethnic israel did not want to be in the gosi strip they do not want to be in the gossistrip the only reason that there is a refuge you probom right now is because commoss useis civilions as not only its human shields but as its targets for indoctrination no state no state on earth would accept a population in its very midst hat seeks its open destruction and if they do that to suicidal state if israel had its druthers israel wouldhave turned the gasa strip into hong cong that was the alter in two thousand five an insteadicomos ternit into what you woul imagine a terrostape again this is the lie the liis that ut again it is always israel tals go back right to the moral equivalents a a an idiot who resigned from the statedpartment ame josh paul former director of the seates departments bureau of political military afairs he resigned from the state department why because he says that the united states needed to force israel to abide by human rihts he said whon october seventh but comos massacra is raly's village i felt sicto my stomac but because of the hor being visited upon innosence and becaus i knew what would come next ah that that is really it yes cause he knew will not come next those those bad bad jews i'll gat that is big line number one big line number to big line numer to is that israel effectively antiianism is not antisematism and that really when were talking about the rise in antisematism were sing all over the globe when we see giant crowds in the streets in london chanting free palestine which means murder all the juicin the area or on we see people in sidney chanting gas the jews they do not actually mean gas the jews they mean that israel should be nicer that is what they actually mean that it gets transmuted and thus antisematism jewhatred is not actually in any way wanting the destruction f the stateof isrels he hers the thing if you admit that antisianism is antisematism the calls for a two state solution become untenable the reason they become untenable is because every one in the palsinian authority and is lonichy hot hierarchy every one and by large sloths of the palcing an population are antisionist when i say large wethim me nearly every one is antisionist ifyou admit that antisianism equals antisematism you are admitting that that population is antisemetic andyeu can make a deal with antisemites instead there has to be the self flattering western bizar view that antisinisman antisemitism are two separat things again thatwas completely exploded october seventh when a group of very left wing many of them piece activist in israel were slaughtered whole sale bi gehadies that was destroyed buthe ngo right back to tatisquanty if antisematism is not antisinism if these are two separable things then what is antisematism most ah of the best way to hide this is to pretend that antisematism in is lomaphobia are two aspects of the same thing there is part of a broader rubric of of a cycle of violins that when muslems call for the destruction of radical mosums calld for the destruction of the state of israel when they go into the streets of sidney and chank asked the jews that that sist part of a cycle of vilens in which jews are doing the same thing to moslems than it jus a psycl of violins alltogether and it really has nothing to do with israel process we can put pressur on israel which just got absolutely destroyed in the south we cant we anst that is that is the goal here rih ti these together and you seeng the administration do the all the time an normac donald had o sweet from two thousand sixteen that is that startes go virol again anti and and it should go virel because it is really funny in which he said quo what terrifies me is vicis were to detonate neucler dvicing kill fifty million americans imagine the bac clashkins peaceful muslims and that is precisely the the line that is now being taken by many members of the media many members of this administration many members of the left is it o my god that the rising is lmaphobia tht's going to be attendants on the murder of fifteen hundred jhus is just got it is gonbogle the mine the rising antisematism that the rising is lomaphobia that is going to be attendant on seen hundreds of thousands people march and solidarity with terrace wow we cannot allow that in antisematism and is lomaphobia theyre both just from the same place that r the same people that that is what is really happening oking now it is not you really really is not that does not mean there are not people who are not racist against muslims or or who or whod see people with brownskan do not them in tat is a very different thing from what we are sing right now which is the desire to fool scale exterminate the state of israel because it is filled with jews instead f is ore not filled with jews it would not be interesting exterminating it would they in any cae you are is corren jompyere yesterday choos ask about the rising antisematism in the united states which ye i mean jews do not feel comfortable on campus because many of them been beaten up jews in skoky are being or oure being confronted with mass protest in favor of comoss every yo i know personally literally every joi now personally is obtaining a gon every one becase if the risin antisematism but here is crnt cerencompier's askabaut antisematism an she immediately swivels in tois lomaphobialand ans yet just why ye've to ask yevetask yourself why and the answer is again it is that desire to separate off antisin ism from antisematism by instead lumping together antisematism and is lomaphobia under some sort of broad rubrik of all all discrimination is bet here is correncon pierre an competent pres secretary t o ry ai a thing a look am we have not thene any credible a threat tin ow there is been always questions about a credible thret and i just when to makesure that that out there bu muslemindos perceived to be muslem have indoit it dis proportionate a number of hate feeld attacks and certainly president min dans that many of our musliem arab ar ermericans an palting american love ones and neighbors a worried about the hate being directed at there communitiesan that is something you heard the president speak to in his in his address just last last thursday hum well i mean iiv heard the question meing about antisematism and yet you immediately swiveled into his lomaphobia how weird how strange why why because if you can swivel into his lamaphobia from a question about antisematism this alows you to avoid you real time real worled implications of the fact that anti israel is antisematic and that is what that is instead you just mis direct by the way coreencjom piar i mean shou pretty much set it openly yesterday and a follow on in a follow on question chos asked about whether antisinism is antisematism on college campis is not shes i o w i no ar ga cerry e e potator collee an su and i precu ete peian e e r an ani oe o thes the pian you anta is real ta an tatana o college an sus a and te tei o im not ging t get in to what is happening across the country in at gif iter not get t gettinon o t pic as the admiral and ra a that wit fomthing at peaceful crotent it is really a parter partef by to markas it being able fopokto to ow these do o wittat anti this is his the martothetictic ols i've ever heard when she says this canst as just cutter ofshes moreon when when she says thi sorist uf just remember her president ran and is going to run again on protestors in charlott's vill shouting about things right antisemetic ant racist protestors in charlotsville i remember her saying things whall tat is the first mema right that is the way that it works that is not the question you have literally spent your entire modern political career suggesting that racesm has no place ant hes is lone these have no place they have no place but when you see it manifest every single day on college canpasses where thousands of people are marching in solid arity with terrors group that is well that is freespy we have nothing to say here nothing to say here these again the idea here is that you can be as anti israel as you want to be up to an including the slaughter of jews and that is basiclly just as lompho by the way just on the merits you in point out here that the number of anti jewish incidents in two thousan and twenty to the ther one thousand five or ninety federally reported incidents related to religion and from of hate crimes fifty one point four per cent we are against jews a majority were against jews how many were poin poat antislomic nine point six per cent in other words five times five times as many hatcrime incidents against jews as against muslims but the administration is focassingin a leiserby mount is lomaphobia again the idea of doing that is to lump to gether all forms of discriminations we can pretend that antisemitism is not a differencs in kind from is lomaophobia and that and that all of its springs from just people who are mean in their harts as oppose to in actual political position of the state of viseral should be evicerated in that the jews ought to go as well in a second we will get to big lie number three which is the one that is the most comforting people just cannot we tust to it wo state solution cannot we just cannot we just wellgets that momentarily first our friends

striming the next generation of kids entertaimen ook kan meanwhile already and then there is big line umber three big line number one is that isrel has to be pressure becaus if they are not pressure to maintain human rights te gn a violate human rights and of course that is all a set up that is ta set up it' lik a set up and punch line the set up is israel has to be preshured not's violate human rights then it' to war and something goes wrongs whell we told them we told them but those jews cannot be control really what happens this whole things big cycle of violence moral equivalents that is big line umber one it is told by a huge number of people in the media and in government big line number too is of course that antisinism is not antisematism nd of those two are separable and you can be just as anti israel as you want you can even konof be in favor of its extermination and that is non anti's matic what you really shuld be focuston is all sorts of discrimination his lomaphobia that is really what we need to be tau king bout its is lamaphobia that is that is the big problem tbecause where auntisematism comes from as the same place that anti is lam activity comes from they all come from the same place and that is you being not true not true at all many things can be bad and also not be alike a big line number three the two states solution is the thing we have to be focused in on right now that is insane i'm sorry that is totally insane that is saying after nine eleven the thing that the united states has to be focas sunright now as coming to a duold toe taliban that is crazy it is nuts kno one would suggest such a thing if you did suggest such a thing people would laugh you out of room but that is now the a dopted mode of literally everyone in western politics whele we cannot let the two state solution die we cannot let it t with whom do you propose to do this two state solution with whom the biggest advocates of the two state solution an israel just got murred thei're children just burned to death alive that is all again the communities around the gosa envelope those places are by and large members of the political left in israel it does not matter to these folks t does not matter at all this s whre you get your bit an sweet again an jobitn talking about the two state solution that is hard as it is we can not give up on piece who is we who is we wat what thyu not known it of course the united states we love to see pece over there da lell woll sty pece over their israel you knw who does not want ta seek piece the other side clearly again very simple plot experiment tomorrow if th if the idev despanded and know jew had a gon every jew in that region is dead every single one if they all give up their gone tomorrow they would all be dead meanwhile if commass had disarmed if comoss were not a terro group t ive happened success i ive happened in the palsing in authority areas were they not siphening money off to their personal bank accounts mok mutabases worth now tens of not hundreds of millins dolars it ben happening if theyd not been building up terrigroups an an doctrinaig their kids to hate jews is a tool against the jewish state it a ben happening prosperity th that the mather is very simple and yet again it is this idea that we all want the same thing we serios we do not we do not i'm sorry to break it to you we do not not everyone on the earth wants the same things as you and it is at no sentrocity of the highest possible level to believe they do when people tell you what they want and then you ignore them and they know what you really want is piece what you really warns is a better economic way of life what you rea youre being piter you oncs ave a paternalism that is paternalism when jobitn says we cannot give up on a two state solution is rallies in palcinians equally deserve to live in safety dignity and piece they may equally deserve to live in safety dignity and pece but only one side is seeking to live in safety dignity and piece you think is raillies are fon of having to draft their eighteen year old kids and ten put them a check points doyou thing that something they love to do would you love to do that f thear kits the answer of courseis know and yet that is what isral hass toyou why because they do not they will be overrun and murred oin their beds as we saw but this is the lie nd theyregoin to keep pushing this lie this is also that that lie by the way that this lie that everyone seeks the same thingis also wht youwent up with the bizar spectacle of john curby who is thespokes person for the national security ad ministration saying that woud be very bad to provoke the vesivs of commos supporters if somebody is out their supporting commoss an there on o vesuther're not even american citizen american citizens have free speech rights but if you are a vesa holder you do not have the abilityos sporttair grup in fact we will not give you o ve siht if you supported tairigroup and it can be applied retroactively legally speaking now joustgon a lie and he is going pretend that if youre veseholder let' say thatyouare foreign student from egypt and you are out there in the streets shouting from the river to the sea palistine wi'll be free and you'r holding up a poster of a commos terrist hes saying none of you ove right to be hre that is just free speak that is not true that is not trobut again it goes back to this base line ridiculous willingness to believe lies that are told to your face while different language is spokein on arabic teva here is john curby and asay spokes person alri algan o o or yu or a or ancaring iin th n ancrtion or they are leter te ancation o ha the e te o or ase oration wortse an caurtion wor t the a to remark oo e o s te do not have toge ith every sentiment thats express in free country li this e to to stand by the thethe iethe first omemen in the idea peaceul pote that is not apply to importing terror supporters into america it does not it does not but again they realited they they are not really ter supperse they just he is raal and n that theyre really they seek piece and the have only put poor presser on the two stayeslishon now in a second herengigto get to the real the real issue here the real issue here is that people this people who are who despises wr won ce he' destroyed people who are who are participating in these lies they are doing either out of moral cowardice or because reality being reality it turns out that the people israel is fighting they do not just hit israel they also hit thowest and many of their fellow travellers also hit to west and what this really is what we are watching in real time an this with disturbing is the the frians panon coalition of the wretched a tempting to destroy western civilized institutions in the name of the supposedly colonialize that is what we are actually watching in real time will get to that momentarily first we do things here very diferently at the daily

and start hiring batter to day what is the actual story as to what is happening here right th one that is behind all the wise again those big wies that israel is real humorise filin are war crime maven really bageus 's bads comas too that anci timatism is lon forbe basically two birds of the of the same color that and fo biglie ree that the the two statesolution israel must be pressor frotwostatesolution thes solves the probim the real answer here is that the people who did what they did on october seven and their allies and their fellow travellers hat to ast israealitious a symptom of that a soce me saying this there is a guy who is a a son of e comas leader his name is mosam hassanuself called son of hamas he endered up converting to christianity and moving away from adical ison he interviewed with jake tapper last night and a he explained what exactly fomas onts what did you see in experience thet man' you turn on hamas and in help israel ys ice thi was tha child they always complent to my father about hamas er abuse of power and th ther gretality an o they ther very sreshect and tha the very religious their fanatics and thbut thit did not think at some point u or the course or this globan trouble yothey they are wiso ter a pratality i witness ther gretality first hand when i was in crisen when the tortured many pelistinian a people for suspicion e of colagratn with israel a again a he he goes on he suggested the fight rinounce that israel's action on the west side even if west as one acknowledge an here he is we surprised at the failure of his raiy intelligence on october seventh listen there was a failure but this is not the time to blame anybody ther ther there is corruption iris failur a thereis lack offle theship but this is not the time now to blame anybody this is the time to get ena fit the thatit tates ne took iv israel the necessary cover to upruel camas hama it israe is fighting on behalf of of america isred is fighting on behal of the pelistinian people isran now is fighting on behalf of the free world this is not uple put i ti ca propagande he is right about that now here is the thing the the commas fight against the free world the that is bact by a group of people who abide by particular philosophy that philosophy in the west is the post colonial philosophy seventeen hundred sociologist yesterday s first all sociologies its an nonsense it is a nonsense field of study socologies a made up field of study almost entirely there are some good sociology books tht hav beenwritten but as a field of study t is a mischmash of absolute garbage stupidity and some interesting insights that is oa sociology is but seventeen hundred sociologists including signatures from professors at harvard yele prince in oxfor brown burkly signed a letter insolidarity with gaza and the palistinian people and here is what they write and again this this says the whole thing quoe sociology as a discipline is rooted in recognition of relationships of power and in e quality as sociologist an human beings we unreservedly condemned the latest violence against the palcing in people and gaza and westbank at the hands of the srali regime the entire by the ay the entire thing does not mention at any point what commosted at any point in te entire leter it is several paragraphs along it is two pages long no mention whatsoever of commass initiating this by mirring fifteen undred civilions at all instead what is the justification for their siding with the palistinians and with and with commass by thefor all the talk about how the palstinian people they do not support comass they do not the people of the la they doft support commass i just ave question where are the protest against chinos in the arab world ware have you seen them anywhere at all bulere no i did not think in any case here is the a here is what the sociologists say quote we join people around the world while raising their voices in protest of this assault on human life as educators it is our duty to stand by the principles of critical inquiry and learning to hold the university is of space for conversation that four grounds historical truths and that contextralizes this past weeks violence in the context of seventy five years of settler colonial occupation in european empire ofll i mean they are just saying the quipart out loutright there seventy five years you may notice does not take you back to nineteen sixty seven it tan'e you back to nineteen forty eight the establishmentof the tateof israel theyare saing israel must be destroyed is ral must be destroyed because it is in their words a colonial outpost is ral must be destroyed because the west cannot be alowed to existing any form even an indigenous form in the mat least it cannot be alowed according to these people that would be an act of colonialism of settler colonialism and that means that any jews livingin the region in the inside of fronsfinon ought to be victimized by violene revolutionary violenc is parton parcelf decolonization these aure people who not only live in the west and have benefited from the west these are people who sit at the highest institutions of learning in the west theare calling the war that is ros now waging on commass a genicidal war which is weird bes again generally when you commit genicide you do not warn the civilians first ou just killed them u nos genicidel rushing into cubouts beriand murdering every one you must nocenicidl warning people for a week on end to get out of an area becus youreatempting tohit a military targ t that is not the same thing they say the stands follows in the tradition of the sivil rites movement anti warn anti parts ad protest of decates pass a lining ourselves with these freedom struggles we call on all of our colleagues to stand in solidarey with palistinians and against settler colonialism imperialism in genicide now this letter is revealing because this is really what its al about the same people who believe that israel is a colonial settler and position believe that the wst is intirely colonial settler and position that the west ought to be dismantled the west is an imperialist structure because it is supported by things capitalism and free markets and free movement of labor and free speak those things are bad theyre settler colonial movements that must be destroyed from without or from within that is what this is all about which presumably is why these higher educators ar for example at oxford now going to debate emotion on thirs day colling for quote into fada until victory a motion share with oxremembers of the universtiny an colege union report ly states that the branch believes that quote only a mass uprising on both sides of the green line and across the middle least can free the palistinian people both sides of the green line would mean vilencs inside israel at the green line for folks are not versetd ind idle eastern politics that would be the territory held by isrel before the nineteen sixty seven sixtay war initiated by the arabs their saying that they want violente across the mddle east in order to quornquo free the palisting in people which would amount to what destroying israel obviously this apparently says quote that the war is a direct consequence of decades to violent oppressionof the palisting in people by these raily state again it is all the juwsfalt and goes on to say it is the duty of the international movemen of workers an youth to support the struggle and they call for a socialist federation of midlease and into fada untio victory that is wht this whole thing is about that that is that is what thi holdhet and theyre just sang it out lats o you wonder why queers for palistine which makes no sense then i know thei'r lodpeople on the right who are puzzled by this what why r their bunch people a transflegs marching longside people who behead them at the first available opportunity why and the answer is becaus not about that its about western civilization is bad and must be torn down in israel is just the tip of the spear because it happens to be a western power that exists in a in a place that is a very different mine set and'swo it has to be dismantle that is the thing that matters more than anything else that is what this is really all about o can meanwhile in terms of the latest news two more hostages were released overnights commass set free two really really elderly hostages and they testify to the fact that commass has hundreds of colometers of tunnels underground a right now what commossis attempting to do is separate off certain hostages from other hostages they have been focussing in on the ones they think will be most sympathetic to the world media that means people who have conections to american media or duel citizens they are going to hold presumably the the mal hostages that they have taken until they shoot them or kill hem that that is their goal and they are going to try to get the west to basiely put pressure on israel for a sease fire that israe that israel jost pretend that the terratacks an take place if the hostages come back and jobidon onfortunately because he is no longer with us he is a he is making sounds that here is jrael bidon being asked about a sease fire yesterday and a what in the worlds yee talking about a firo whywhat what is it what is it e sas first he says sure we shuld ave sese fire then e's ac know we should't have a sese fire then he is wele may be wellek to the hostages home and then we will talk about a seas fire or maybe a seas fire would benefit comoss which is why they are calling for one in the first place an tere's there is one other concern that is now been raise to the for this is the concern on the part of some people on the right and this is the concern tha there is some people on the right woi think or being fully disingenuous and whare looking for an excuse to jump right on the same moral equivalency bandwagon as e left i think there is certainly people that we talk about them onthe show before i'm shr ble talk about them on the show again but one of the moves that is being made n or if you stifle israel's response this is to claim that if israel does respond as attastrospond or to rude out comoss entirely that this will end in worldworth ray yesterday tuckor hat on his programm a general name douglas mc gregger mc greggor has in the pass suggested that jewish money is behind americans but for israel and all the rast but mc greggor it has militsary experties and heis essentially now warning that armagetten is coming which and and his propose solution would be that israel does nothing which by the way absolutely promotes the idea of ar magettan because if israel's nothing after fifteen hundred of hits citizens are slaughtered and closs remains in place the chance is of a broad scale multi front attack on israel that require american intervention go up aratically but douglas mc rggor is on a tuck across an tucker of course has been pushing a pascivist line on the since the beginning i hear what here is tuckerif mc greggor last night do you think that we are moving toward war with the road yes i do and it looks the chasin destination isingeed armagen there does not seem to be any real appreciation for the implications for us and and frankly for europe in the world as well asa it te least of such action fora to hath mc greggor has also been an advocate of the united states basically leaving you crane to fry but when when mc greggor saysl things we are we are right on the virge of worth ron the whole point is deterrents de termins is a thing what em boldins are on weakness this has been true for literally ever but there isbeen thi sequation that is now happend on the rght wore if you stand up to a terror power the idea is that i somehow puts a mericop in a position that is weaker which again is a not wrightwing position that is not a concervet of position it is never been a concervative position far as i'm aware peece through strength has been at concervative position for as long as i'v been a lit certainly this idea that t you are hightening the chances of a world war if if america actually flectes its muscles sometimes is its a bazaare one when what we knows precisey the opposite the reason this attack was launched on isral first place is because the biht administration was conciliatory toward ron tit is one of the reasons the plat from afgannistan is another reason mc greggor says this thing will not ay contained which wuld be mostly true if americal wornt there to keep a lit on it the whole point of america having aircraft carriers n mediterranian is to say keep it keep a lit on it do not open up a second front with as block as that is going to tere the lit off the're too many unnowns an uncertainties here and everyone always assumes tat the beginning of such a conflict wel'll be contained it will only have to fight these people hummoss may be hispelel it never works out that wa these things always last longer than everyone thinks the resources required are much more profound than what we anticipated and remember we have already used up many of our wore stocks in you crain kate when he is at first all every one has an nterest in keeping this contain everyone the bet bet toget i thet there is this ugly thing that that is been happening tucker does not a lot in which he suggests that if you disagree with him on the tactic to keep the thing contain hean i want the same thing no war with ar on no american involvement in this region of the world that amounds to american boots on the ground we all want the same thing here but the idea is that if you think america sho fluts its muscles in order to push pisballas off the ball for example then this means the us you want the worwrithr ound whch of course is is really scurrilist iis not t is not true mc greggor goes faras say we have to save israel from itself that is israel must be saved that the only way is to cram down on israel what what can sav isrel apparently is em is some sort of piece steal brokerd with comass by the turks who support commas that is moc gregger's actual solution here the support for israel is going to e rod and at the same time the anger and hatred inside the region which already dislikes israel it is going to be phenomital israel is doing something that i think no one has ever accomplished at least not in my lifetime and that is uniting sunny and sheer against itself that is why i think we have an obligation to save israel from itself but that is not a popular position right now it is bobs away and everyone is cheering well i mean save israel fom imself how you men therecan not earn the love of the soony and sheel woreld by not taking out fomas and allowing in citizens to be slaughtered wholesele an taken hossage an thr's a fundamental mis understanding of the region ill i'll chalk it up to funda mental misunderstandin and not something mornifarrious because that is what it seems to be but agan t what is scurrilist is the implication that if you believe that piece through strength is an actual workable strattage in the eleast which his toricllate hasban that if you believe that that somehow you are in favor of a broader war and that of course is not true in any way sha perform ardy coming up woer can be joined by andrew clavin has a bran new book out sa lot of fine pussell get to theposic today with him if you are not a

heaven ma carthy is oused from his posicion as speaker of the house by the republican circular firing squad trumps civil fraud trout continues and criminalityes frieds across america's major cities i' benture of this is the bench viro show tona shos ponsfrom express we pian do you lie or bye pistur being seen and sold to advertisers no meaneither get expess we pian right out express we pians i coum flashmen what if i told you that the gop had pretty much every systemic advantage going into twenty twenty for they d deeply unpopular presidents of the united states the proval ratings in the high thirities low forties of a presidents of the united states the provalratings on the economy in the thirties or twenties what ife i told you that the gop had not economic edge on the issues that is their biggest since nineteen ninety one whell what if i told you that going into the election there is a very solid shot that jo bidans economic policies were going to drive america trectly intoresession whal all of those things are true all of those things are true and yet somehow republicans have come up with a bran new strategy this strategy is to join in idiocrasides movy from the two thousands join in the idiocrasy show al my balls this is their actural strategies us to kick themselves over and over in the balls until they went ii cannot see any other strategy here i i do not know why its hacpening it makes no sense to me it is incredibly frustrating because i would to see jobidan notke president of te united states i'd to see democrats not make policy for the united states i' thucsure men ot to be the senti majority leader and yet since republican victory in twenty sixteen republicans have lost somethng aleven governorships republicans have lost something twenty plust holicetes republicans have moved from a majority toa minority in the senate all in the face o wildly unpopular democrat policies the democratic party has moved to the ratical left they continue to muror all the policies of the ratical left the american people do not them on any of the issues and yet democrats keep getting elected and the question becomes why why would that be well may be the reason for that is because republicans are strategically en apt maybe it is because republicans have essentially decided that protest votes are more important than actual votes maybe they have decided that dowsing themselves in gazoline and settin a match is is probably the best strategy i nol it strategy four other than may be feeling good for a brief moment in time becasif we show frustration to our leadership class thon for sure well get a new leadership class and then some ody all centers wait pollon the incensive structures exactly the same an thomas sol says very frequently with regard to politics that people big mistake when it comes to politics is believing that the problem with the politicians is the politicians rather than the incentive structure that creates the politicians and that is exactly correct republicans have now replaced in the last few years paulrianat speaker of the house jon baner a speaker of the house now cevmacarthea speaker the house what is changed seriously what is changed what what magical new things have happened from the replacemen of any of the speaple a speaker of te huse now i was not a baner ofan i did not want baner to be speaker f the house have og uas fir to conciliatory tor baracobama i thought paulrine was fine i'v ouht come mac carthy was fine what apparently we ten to be operating under the wild delusion that if we simply replace one speaker wit another speaker and leave the incents of structure exactly the same then everything will be yo better things will change that is not how any of this works the incent ive structure right now in the house f representative just take the latest example because yesterday cem mcarthy wais outset is speaker of the house for no reason i can discern by eight republicans who join with all demicrats to ause mac carthy which means that ninety six percents of the republican caucus voted in favor of cemmicarthy and micarthy is no longer thespeaker because o tht at house republican who decided that mc charthy had to go for a reason that no one can actually discern or specify the incent of structure right now unfortunately for a huge number of people is gat famous run for a higher office win or lose does not really matter clean up pick up some chacks start a pack startan on profit move in to a different aeria of your career this is a different incense of structure the use to be when parties were more powerful that they actually have the ability to punish their members now that was bad in some ways because it meant the party leadership actually mattered an awful lot because the party leadership could decide the direction of the party and because of that the party structure was weakened well the result of that is that there is a massive collective action problem whereby a few people can hold hostage the entigh republican caucus for no reason that any one can can explain yen in order to realy understand how dumb all of this is what you have to understand is that keven mac carthy was by pretty much any measure the most conservative speaker the republicans have had since new gingridch the he achieved actual winds against jobidon the last continuing resolution that the people who ousted him are very angry about he proposed a better one two weeks ago that they that thy scuttled they said was not good enough and s they scuttled it and he had to pass a continuing resolution and even then he stripped out funding for the cranewor and somehow he is th vaggi and this is not that cemmicrthy the most amazing politicion ofall time he that he he would be the greatest speaker in history it is he got no replacement e got no strategy this all grand standing nonsense there is no purpose to it what winds are you are you attempting t i said this during the original speakership fight back in january chiproy was one of the people who may be considered for the speakership slot if he wants it ou know wy any one in the world would want that job is a horrible job it is the second worsjob in a merica behind donalds froms personal lawyer i i do not understand what chiproy did not want this bot ge but inicate chiproy back in january he said i want certain concessions from a carthy and then he got them and then he said o cemicarthy should should be speaker that is a plan but this is not a plan this is just people ranting and raving again this is leberoy jankins can gressional version is beal running for no reason into a brick wall and then declaring victory as they bleed it is it is an amazing thing aagainst to truly understand how done this he oust understand how vulnable democrats are and to understand a vulnerable democrates are letthim give you just the economic situation in the united states right now stocks tumbled on tuesday accorn

him been threatening thes for a few days after the passage of the continuing resolution as a clean continuel resolution tht only takes some forty five days into the future there is more room for negotiation but don macgates decided that he would had enough of speaker mocarthy now the predicutt for this roset back an january because mc carthy had basically pladged that any one at any time could bring what would be a no confidence vote a vote to remove moc carthy and what that men is that anybody at any time could make national headline to become an international political figure by going up against mocarthy for good reason or bad and makate who just waiting for his opportunitye what that men for macgates and for some of the people who surround him is scuttle a better continuel resolution a couple of weeks ago then a new continuing resolution goes forward mc carthy has to passit because otherwise we been going to a government shut down with no prospect of actually passing a bill because gates is already suggested you will not sit support really another build anything thats that' tactully passibold in te sentit control by democrats and then matgates says how democarthy work with democrats on thies bill after helping scuttle a republican only built how dare you work with democrats i'm going to file motion to vacate the chair and then he along with seven other republicans votes with the entire democraticalk is to get redemocarthy just to get the logicere macgates is very very angry that majority of republicans voted with some democrats to pass a continuen resolution that only happen because macgates and his cruw decided not to vbot for a republican only version of the continuel resolution a couple of weeks ago and now he and his friends voted with all democrats in order to oustmocarthy such bad decide with democrats very very ba is hav unless you are ousting your own speaker as a heldles strategy and makes no sense unless what you actually believes that this has nothing to do with strengthening the republican caukus or making the housemore conservative it make sense of what you believe is that is really about grand standing and getting headlines in raising money in senting out text messages then it makes some sense and that is what american potics is be come about it is all about an sensive structures again to go back to soald this is all about insensive structures youvolivan is a really god political furest he is sent for quite a while than one the big problems right dow n the modern erub is thate oure political class are insensivice to use congress and political power as a platform for other things it used to be that the institution of congress shaped you you went in you learned how the game was played how the sausage was made and then you participated in that crocess now you going to congress and basically your job is to comments on everything that is going on and to grand stand for people back home and to not get anything done ans nofm anot getting things done i's not whether those things are good or bad but the insentive right now it is a simply yellot things and then get a cable hit and then pertraye yourself is he most conservative guy in the room here is haw went down yesterday yesterday magates move the ganst mac carthy there 's laughter oun the housefloore mostly from democrats were i cannotn't believe the republicans are oing this what in th whyse this even a thing that is happening right now here was at gates moving gainst mac carth yesterday for what purpose heres a gentlemen fror newjersy seek recognition and here ou laging cam his quick lash fat madgates cap back when palrine was speaker the opposed ousting paulryan and here is madgates speakin on fox news of the time if we take paul ridt off the field right now instead of being able to finish strong in the hundred fifteenth congress we will shatter into a bunch of factions fighting against each other for power we got enough of thout of washingtot already paul rin can be a caretaker of the speaker ship we can have a leadership olection we can go into the midtern strong hat i'll think the pushing about early if you hav what a go it ha as thow is matgates in twenty eighteen gay hav mem that long and am what changed the answer what changed is pretty much nothing except that madgates realize t t youget a lot more credit among a certain group of people for shouting and round thing at the wind and and making moves this then you would for you kno actually getting things done in congress again i'm all four people o trying to exact more concervative concessions whom the speaker o the huse that is fine but there were no concessions actually attempted or exacted here speageran carthy it had a choice you had to basically bring up e motion to table the motion to table if it d succeeded would have stopped the motion to vacate motion to table whutd ever lie presumably on some democrats democrats light what i'm not i'm not con kill you but i do not have to save you this the bat man prospective from batmand agains which is you gis this a probem of your own making why would i possibly save you now is that good fates of course not i mean democrats know that they are likely to get somebody in that republican seat next time who is a who is probably going to be the had of another weak cacas going to be very difficult to negotiate with because again yant it is is too fracturous the rules of the caucas do not make for the ability to consolidate policy m mc harthy had had basically worke with them in good fate on couple of issues but they do not car im an why should they care i'm not con put this tine democrats ya if you ware f youhe suere on theother foot and ndemocrats were busy ousting ha keem jeffreys and you are the speaker of the house i wouln be saing the re publicans on to save them i do not blame democrats were doing what democratsyo i've len re publicans for voting with entirely democrats in order to outthrown speaker for no reason again that makes any sens mc carthy instad call the vot the motion to table fail the vote went forward and in the end the eigh re publicans who voted along with all democrats to oust mac carthy from the speakership were representeve to any bigs of arizona who is a wild and crazy character can buck of coleradge hom birchet o tennesse e cran of airs on a bob good of virginia nancy mates it south carolina a at rosendale of montana and dom again it is it is a mazing becauses thei'r complaints were were sort of vague to say the least bob good got up into the speaker fought through fifteen vots in january to become speaker bout is only willing to fight through one failed sear before surrendering to the democrats on saturday we need a speaker will fight for something anything besides just stanger becoming speaker what ol would you suggest and the an there is never an answer to this understand matgates does not now who th helskan become speaker itsike has an alternative plan he is a dog that caughthe car what they the do not know what that hells happening next every single person they re suggesting for place mc carthea speaker supported mc carthy for speaker that is jim jordan from ohio that is that is chiproy from texas all these people voted from mc carthy for speaker and opposed to this motion what is this exactly wo at really is is then act of personal pik and also now personal political benefit for mackates and when the insensives are not alone wit th starsartlinewhen you are personal political benefits run directly against the interest of the party at large or the movement at large the instentive structur right now says ther gana always be rogue actors who are able to do this sort of thing it is a problem well get to the

o case yesterday it wen this mac carthy called the vote on a motion to table it failed then he was force to bring to the floor according to the deal that he had made with these republicans the motion to vacate the chair and cere is mc carthy defending himself i's that getes plann this all long here was yesterday no if i couted how a te solittl other tot t tho it wit got aloll tell if you explaind the e why man wha o therande do not her why na a ta ti thin mat has plan this all lon tin mate what we transpired knowhe would tat it if if wearen' shad that on tot a i thoroughly believe it is the right decisions kee ofen ment open to make sure i militaryis still paid or border agents is still paid at that makes a chalel and sould mase upon whether i should be speak ot to that fight ther wiht well it turned out that it was not blofg he was assuming a ma know he mc carthy he was assuming that in the end even the rogue actors would have enough we have enough werewithal to assume that voting entirely with democrats was he bad look and that they would come backc into the full and he was wrong it turns out that the personal insentevce did not a line with the rest of the republican insentives for pesent of the cacas takes hiw the other ninety six percent of the caucas mc carthy said keeping the goverment open was the right decision because we had no alternatives that the buill that i tried to advance was opposed by the sam people trying to keek me out of speakership now i had a lot of republicans that won me to do it i never did it the mancy and i get no we really do not get along but i thought the instatution was too important andi thought that was too personal which heu know at the end of the day ceeping government open and paying our troops was the right decision i stand by that decision and then the day if i've to lose my job ofrt be it but i' get o fight for the american public and a'll continue t fight and as you will see people in there publican cawcas from the right tide the harks left side of the cawcas supported mc carthy in retaining the speakerships to representive least tof fannic who is a very trumpy congresswomen from new york which he is more on the left wing of the re publican cawk is yesterday she said ian understand why were going out from mc carthic whats to deal here cabin mc carthy is a happy warrior he is tireless he passed that uniquely american grit under cabin speakership that lasted fiftteen rounds of ha never giving up this republican majority has exceeded all expectations we reopen the people's house we passed the strongest borters tecurity bill in our nation's history we passed an energy plan to unliche american enegy dominents we passed efence bills to support our troops under cabin's leadership he is brought hundreds and hundreds of by partisan members of congress to israel our greatest ally he elected the most diverse class of republicans ever with the largest number of republican women ever in american history this boy from baker field he cares deeply about his constituents his country and the american plonking atste fani he is on the left wing of the republican party then got thomas massey who is very much on the right wing o the re publican party extremely stringents with regard to spending an here is manssy support of mac carth yesterday is the only member who serving here who took every chance to vote against speaker bainter and avote against speaker rive i can tell you that this chamber has run has been run better more cons ervatively and more transparently under mister mc carthy then any other speaker that i have served under as a member of the rules committee what what a three what a three conservative who were place there out of trus the speaker gave us o blocking position by putting three of us on there to keep an iy on the rules tocommittee commake sure the process with fair and even i can tell you it is ban fair an even not a bostor voting against the speaker to day

gat what exactly was matgates his argument while was not t at he sating wit trump on this trump wanted mc harthy to be speaker yit wasn' hat hes siding with th ripling o the party on this ship roy thomas massey they wanted mc carthy to be speaker by the way you are not talk about disloyalty and american politic haout the fact t mc carthy has been incredibly loyal to for example present and trump and trumpets nowhere to be found in any of this just completely absent not waighing in with gates not wagng in with anybody just he took up tok a breather on this one meanwhile gates gets up and he assails mac carthy e give a speech of sailing him agan he did not convince anybody but he did have enough of the aphe would have enough of the hand of on unalined cawkas to to topl him on the basis of whatever this is here is gates the probm on my friend from ohios a argument is that many of the bills he reference tos having pass or not law we are on a fast track to an omnibous bill and it is tif o colts to chant tein o over site when houseor poblicins hapvin even sent ti to pin at a hunter bi to targumake the argumen that over side is the reason to continue when it sort of looks failure theater failyour theater you's not failure theater habout you apposed the sar habout the failure theater of what if we what if we propose a bill in congress to cot all spending and then we sended to a democraticsenante and democratic president and then if you do not vot forit is because youre insufficiently conservative yous a not failure theutere this is failure theater and in this renowis ant jer failure yeutere failure it is stupid failure again it is rammingyourself in the face of tha brick it is dumb i ok a then he wouldidn't gates by the way tingers trashmiccarthy he then trashed all of his republican colleages as well my college says wee pass the strongest border bills in hestury will guess li look at the border right now whe did not use sufficient legerae an ta det limit or in any other thing tactually get results on the border the borders o disaster really something i do nothing you'r gottio be campaigning on thut you fix the borer and what it comes to how those rased money i take no lacture on asking patriotic americans to wayn and contribute to this fight for those who would grovel and bend me for the lobbiests and special interests who own our leadership whot i fouch wo all you want who hold out this town and a bard against the future of our futureeneration this is the sault e all this ti t reasely s gardi unboly ord ones the shas tor chenishetitopy i thit is such stupid every element of this assumes that you are moron every single element of sumsiismoron the house passes a very strong border bill and thn it turns out you knowt controls the senate democrat you knows the president a democrat you think anyof those things become lon of course not and thn he is i whell did not become law did it that is yourfault how is it possibly their fault they did their part they pass to bill and then it goes nowhere tbecause know negotiation took place because of people magates ownt understand that argument then he is main the case whell all fund rayes however a won i can take lecturers on people who are bought on pay for you are literally fund raising off of doing a thing that does not move the ball ford for conservatives one inch not one centimeter you are making money off of that you are fun raising off of that and then he is doing the the pathetic rotime ary calls all of his collegues corrupt but dis i just such if you fall for this grift it is a grift if you fall for this grift man i've got a i've got a beat up tour lopy from nineteen sixty eight to sell you for five hundred thousand dollars made you will take that to because this is a grift bo kaye there is nothing else happening here other than a graft i can tell because there are two hundred and twenty two republicans in the house of representatives and two hundred and fourteen of them voted together and eight of them voted with demographt to do nough i this is not about moccarthy this about the idea that you can make money and he can make a in the republican party right now by losing and pretending that you are winning and fighting the establishment whatever that means there hav been establih mrem politicians i'm just wondering ist this chipbroy warnt is thomas maxy an establishmen politician who the hell are you talking about who are you even talking about byan inif emin't tic lectures from mat gate i'm fiscal iur responsibility it i noticed i noticed that matgate was a big backer and continues to be a big and dorcer of a presidential candidate who refuses to touch entitlements on principle virtually all debt in the united states is driven by rantitlement programms s again he is just assuming your more on he is a sumin that when he shouts about spending an how he wancs to lower it tht you are going to ignore the fact that heis in dorse candidates who spend seven shrillion dollars more money than any person in the history of america and has tvoud never to cutt pentlements when he talks about how he is gen a raise money and he is not con take lecture from anybody else raising money i should points out here at this point the goven mc carthy for all the people are saying about him keven mc carthy aline packs spent millions of dollars supporting various members of the cawkus that ended up olsting him his majority committeed contribute contributed ten thousand dollars each to the campaigns of mat rosandale nancy makes antinberchat in last election cycle give five grandeach to elike crane and bob good the majority comitee alsings tro reten grand each to victorious sparts warran davidson they were all in favor a voting to vacate mc harthy in the first place again this is is is just it it is it is such it is obviou that there is a group of republicans in power and in the media who think you are an idiot and are ot can tell you the truth on any of tese matters because they believe that if they just tell you that somebody is insufficiently conservative then that is enough theren't have to prove the case there' have to provide the evidence then ife to pravid his strategy bet an n this this sort of theatere pure purism where i'm the most pure because i say that we should we should spend no money on these things does not matter if it goes nowhere thoesn't matter if we gen up losing elections but i've been pure that is not how any of this worksbut i guess it is how this works if if if people celebrate basd ontus and that gates is celebrating to day he got his win i do not nowhat he can get for his win but h got is win people of coll thyu unan ofcices people say teris to your bettefir the lord is to the bettefir o ou i to to it is the betnefit of this country that we have a better speaker of the house than ceaven mc carththe keven mc carthy could not keep his word he made an agreement and january regarding the way washington would work and he violated thout agreement we are thirty three trillion dollars on that we are facing two point to trillion dollaranual defasits we fac a d dollarization globily that we will crush americans working class americans keven mc carthy is a feature of the swamp he has risen to power by collecting special an trus money and rea distributing that money in exchange for favors we are breaking the fever now well this is breaking the fever again i to yer are you willing to restructiron pentlements you are about i tu point you trillion dollar neffisit every year what is driving it man areyouling talk about that really i if wouldyoulike say something about thout two the candidate who youve indorse for presidents of te united states h un principal sensible not do anythingabout it again all thes people woare complaining about spending i remember them complaining when there is a republican president of the united states and when there is re publican senate it ison ly whn the can make hag gates after all this is over he treated the fight is not over now we must elec to speaker i'll get any suggestions who is out ther who wants the job and now every body in congress turns into homersimpson backing into the bushes every single person in congress cause this is a job man if you have to deal with this caucas and this caucas is fractions than the very first sine that one of them can make in a nice emiss an be see appearance and clear buck from a tax message that your speakership is in danger why would any one want that job it is a terrible job ce mc carthy did issue a closing statemen as he left the speakership position her is what he had to say no let us be fair and it is wrong it you ever say theyare not conservatives they voted against one the greatest cut in history that congress has ever voted for two tulin they voted against work requirements they voted against me pe re for they voted against border security they voted against got they do not get to say their conservative because the're angry and their chaotic that is not the party i belongd to the party of ragan was if you believed in your principles that you could govern in a conservative way they are not conservatives and they do not have the right to have the title yis am he is not wrong about any of that i'm gotten to know some passpeakers of the house inside ther from gingridch to rhyan to mc carthy and letme tell you when you have no power over your own caucas you do not hav power that is it you democrats know this isetem sport nancyplose you was able to weels fer power with tremendous authority because the democrats at least understand that in the end you vote with your party and the reason you vote with your party is to get things done youono advance the ball the sort of three radical nonsense is counter productive that tweet is telling the fight is not over now we have to elect to speaker oke who who who is your preferred candidate who is the bast who is

letting matches in winning why is carry running for senate nairs on a why is that a thing that is happening carit carrylake just ran for governor vars on and lost to a wet dish ragnam catihobs she she under performed dramatically how she sould have per formed again arizona very much yourge is a state that should be red arizona until very recently had two red senators and a red governor in of ducy now it has to blue senators any blue governor why keep dominating people who lost to mnot first lithought she is already the governor i mean how can she be both the sentate r and the governor at the same time in its it is quite a mazing what is what is the plan for victory what is the plan for victory and doubling down on stuff is not a plan for victory i ton't understand you not else is not a plan for victory whet else not plant victory destracting from jobidin being a horrifyingly bad president that the re publican party seems bound in derman to distract from that by having a primary to many candiates in ate tim scott continues to run in absolutely quickside a campaign there is no reason for m to be in the campaign an the said before if one have a true interesting fight inside the republican party over whoi's best poise to take on jobidon heu need to get rid of some of these candidates tim scott i the guye there is no reason he should e on the stage tim scot he is not breaking wind let along three present the poles according to politico timscott is struggling to break though an iwa in now hampsire but a top campan adviseris privately lobbying donters to stick with him until the pimary reaches his homestate of south carolina that is absurd he is not on a wind south carolina he is notin running out running nickey halean south carolina he is not o rown trump in south carolina what we will get he is just a bunch of candidate stayng in intil south carolina trumple wind by default and maybe that is what you want but that does not seem a le jit nominating process to me in terms of giving americans a real choice heu nednot consolidate the feel prety obviously but again the insensive structer for every candidateis stay in as long as humanly possible rathe n simply saying my candidate has no purpose i'm out and go back to being a successful senator an a great guy from the state of south carolina insteid i'm just going to stay in meanwhile on the trump front donal trump ispending his days in te courtroom now gan that is not his fault he is being prosecuted for no apparent reason in at new york the prosecuting him for fraud despite the fact that the people hes supposedly defrauden say that they did not relyon his assortions of value in order to issue loans for example he would say yet my partment is worth a bajulian dolars and its three times te size it is and the lone officer would then say i'll kate yu norgan nto organ nto our own apprasel and the they would do it base on the aprasel and now that yeu're going after i flight to unfifty millintimes understand ite stupid and mhe can see how how drummed up all of this is and thereis a a pool camera i inside the courtroom the other day then the honestly the obtects of this are awkward and weird you have got letitia james who is in th backgran she is the g of new york who is been pledging for years scuff ononal trum and she is a glaring at trump in the background and then the camera makes its way round to judge angeron who is t e judge in this case was a liberal democrat wi such mugging for the camersall groast and stupid he heares with the pool cameral look yeu're more likely hat camera o be y yos in suming in sogand wit tes shucane tas rus er that bungerler it is all in rested the dellman on god wher we are trump ab yon this o ter te o work if she is a crown show she is glaring and trung et the pla after to a sen on trump u well be either kill with ra wher they wopbin trill and then a a camera personas oning his way around the roon avins is we i r o annop in in con an o on e camera o i the or ground an but tero ot on our country is such clowncho it is such a clownchobe do you is any of this likely to make your bidin not president that is all i care about make jobid not the resident any more two thousand twenty four that shu be the campaign slogan and again is on trums fault they's been dragged into caurt in this particular case but if the entire campagns an revolve around the stuff he is not in win if the entire campaign is about donal trums legal troubles he is not going to win well now he is been told to watch what he says thatn post or risk anding up behind bars frup to month in the secon day of the former presidents financial fraud trial juch arthur engaron just issue t limited gagldr against every one in thiscible case to stop verbale and social medeorlated posts post it swipes ot members of his staff personal attacks on members o my qourtstaff or unacceptible not appropriate en gron made clear tuesday after trump took a partisans swing at the judge as principle law clerk alsin greenfield on trumps truth social platform calling what trump did pot a disparaging untrue and personally identifind post about a member of my staff engron only sited one of the defendents is one behind the post but i was obviously referring to trum then now' t e leade posto greenfield and picture standing next to chuckshumer and calls her sumer's groll friend with this long history of going on offence to dayis the first time any judge as put the restrains of a gagler on trump that is according to deadlinean by the way en garon would love nothing better than to put donald trump behind bars for a month he would love it itwould be this favorite thing in the entire world trump for his part he is campaigning against the grosely in competent and fraugunalent lhe tissu james i notice is not the crn presidents of the united states i'm not blaming trump for going on offence on the stuff by point is if the entire rates is a bag donals trums legal troubles he is not going to win i know tht s an audacious claim but if the entire campaign is about that his chances victory are a lotslemer than they would be if the opposite were true democrats know this which is why they are doing it now that can be onfair it can be wrong it is unfair and it is wrong all those things are true also you do not my to priority is t e conservative not jo biding be jobi noping president that is my top priorty i do not what the're doing t trumping it is very bad we should defut we should all contribute to donals trumps legal defense fun and then we might wont thing by nominating acaunted who is not gon to spend the next eight months in the court room spending every every dollar that goes into his campaign fun on legal fies and here is trump yesterday going after out the tisa james iall i he gain he is not wrong about any of that also what is already talking bout today now the shoul be talk mautis the economic news to the conomic news for trobidnis awful an recession as i' been saying for month what goes up must come down it went up nouse can come down where the economy's goin people are holdig the money and cash every invester i know right now is waiting to see what happens with prices the cause a sentially when the economy goes down that is when everything goes on saile of the store lot of people oare waiting to buy up assets when they hit when they hit the skids right now that ben artificially buggled by inflation but they are going to go down as can take a little while for the economy come back recession is probably around thequorana shuldn't that be top of mind for most americans in fact it is top of mind for most americans unless they are focased in on dum crap unless they are focasin on stupidity ie an there is a reason democrats are doing thi strategically democrats oure putting trump in the dog in order to make that the top issue you make tay o they will let let us defend trump by making him the nominye then you are you are in fact iving democrat what they want because what they do want is trump in the dock as the nominyte they can only control one part of that puttng trump in the o they cannot control the other part makin him the nominyte wen i get the emotional temptation to say oka well they they they want it let us give it to him goodand heard the probm is is that going to work is that likely to work is tht going to be beneficial or not theye're many issues on the democrat side ofthe out to talk about again democrats should be historically on popular reight now if politics were working wage should work wright now democrats would gotten blown out in the last election cycle republicans would control the senate republicans lost ot least four senate seats they shouldhave won in the last election cycle which would ave given tem a fifty three sept majority in the senate republicans should have had a housemajority not of four or five or sixpots they shoud ave had a housemajority of twenty every one knows this is the case but again frustrationwen the entire system is is leading people to a think with with lower parts of their anatomy rather than teir brain a's not going to end well on can meanwhile one of the things that mak be americans by one talk about is the giant crime wave that is now in gulfing at the nation again in cities all over the united states have mobs of roving criminals or toin criminal things and now they have been at least two left waying journalizt social justice advocate socl who have been legitimately murdered in major american cities ryang

josch cruger who is a local journavist a journalist and community activs an philadelphia a defon the police actvist he was shot seven times inside his own home in philadelphia no where im motive for a shooting t no rest have been made at this point meanwhile texas congressmen henry quayar was car jac tak gun point in washington d c that is som things that things are going well all over it is it is just it is going great and and then carreenson pierr this is and democrats have no come back to the fact that these crimes are occurring in their cities on their wach hereis here is c g p correton pere worlds worst press secretary trying to blame henry quayar's carjacking on republican somehow ou remember congers i na fe aa tere fo of tamations who es look we are grateful an rely that the conciisman s unharned we a understand what communities are going thug across the country not just thin that way to president to action very early on i aministration c get the american rescan randin without thean has the american rescu republicans voted against the american rescuplan which pass by the way and it is republican's fault that people again stab to death on the streets of new york makes perfetent can it is a target rich envirenmen forepublicans right now it really truly is obviously that means a time for republicans to u te sent up a circular firing squad and go to town ut ca time for some things i and then some things that i hate just as democrats can rou for ass inside the republican party i can root for cass inside the democratic party gava newsom announced a woman ame lafanza butler who is actually a merrylander for united states senate he put out a tweetsting i'm proud to announce california's new united states senteta lafanza butler as we morn the enormous loss of senter finestin the very freedoms she fought for reproductive fre tomequal protection tafety from gun violencs have never been under greater assaul lafanza has spent her entire career fighting for women and girls andhas been a fierce advocate for working people she use to be a b a union leader and she is also the present of emily's list which they proabortion group but most importantly says gavenuesom she will make history becoming the first black lesbian to openly serving the u senate well slo cla for dacfercity an because thas the thing that really matters in sadly she is not a little person with an an as far as i'm awear no dat native american heridage but it she had those things she giy perfect we's just make her the president by dfault she says e nuwsum says i've no doubt she will carry th baton left by senter fines and continue to break glass cealings and fight for all californians in washington whichill be good since she is been fighting for marylanders for quite a while now an ga meryland now now the only state in the union with three you s senators sat's a sending whi o i this well because again in california the igncaus extraordinary chaos in his first public re marks about his senate appointman gavenusom said monday is completely up to la fon to butler whether she runs for the seat previously held by dian fine stine he had said tht he would a point an intrum senator i suppose to lie a permanent senator and the ris speculation that he had said to a fons o butler i'm goint to actually a point you but you cannot run next time 'll be an out anow war between atam shiff and barbara lee but you cannot i'm i'll make ou the senator but your not permanent instead he is just throwing her in there and now the democratic partyes can have to have an intersectionality fight oh ye the best kind of fight this kind of fight were laphons a butler turns to barberlen hays you are black but are you a lesbian do you the ladies becaus if not i should be the california senator am mewhile adamshift is over here goin well i am i am a jewish guy but that does not count is intersectional any more that is alkword simall in favor of the intersectionality fight in my old home state of california nesom said i think will fonds o butler is uniquelly position simply the best person i could find for this momen in the job now the real reason he appoint to lafonto butler is he is trying to shor up unions support in advance to a possible presidential run should jo bide an keel over physically in the iddle of twenty twenty four we all know this is the case he is basily checke off every diversity box he can fined in the senate pick that hean go back to the crentic to to black american flight the'r a point a black woman in go back to eld you be tea people meulik wh i did a point alesbian and then he can eu guies you noft i did here i appointed such i pointed a yunion member an a warshon pro li get ah all box is checked newsom puid pletion twenty twenty one to fill the sy with a black woman if given the opportunity by the way imy favorite game that the left likes to pllainthemedia on this particular stuff is newsom will say i ned ablack woman and hen he points a black woman i said she is a point ecause she is black woman pe'llik how dare you say she as appointed because she is a black woman she as just the best person for the job well gang here is the thing i did not say it he said it in the saye where the comalla heiris was appointed because she is a black woman ta's just the reality i dn't make the rules you made the rules whatever she as size the governor said she would be an ideal canditive for the seat if she chooses to run for it sat i've got in incredible a point ee it is a i love this barbara le had said it was an insult for nos sim to a point a black woman to a caretake ar role when he had said that he wantet a polece hold er a point tee staid he would not actually intervening the electior barberale is not it she they should be permanent now barbara leis eaten those words this is a really entertainingsef by the way laphons a butler is the most radical senator in america now she back to plan twa bolish balo cross california for criminal suspeced democrats e the fact that a publicans are losing to this party the the allansimpson was republican senter fror my oman and he once suggested that american

your allies might be the produs an honcong at been international news for moncs kicked off by people's fears that mainla an china is threatening some very basic things about their city and their lives but fra the coverage here it our show we fon we were not seeing many stories whe we got to know anybody very well we they were what exactly they expected was going to come out ofthe protest giveng chinas and chansigens three of us arrived in honcong in in september me and emanual and our cowork or dian will i have to say one of thigs that was fascinating giveng the ugly state of democracy hering theunited states lately was to be among many young people who believe intensely in democratic ideals and yearned deeply for the basics normal elections free speech and fre assembly though just in thelast feew weeks since we got to hon cong we watch the situation changed dramatically it is gotten much more violent harshly measures by the government this hour we have the story of the change that we witness what we think it might mean if you have not been following the story at all may be been setting this one outwork in a catch you up on what you need to know we have all sorts of people from all sides of this that we want you to mee he be asy chicago its this american life this wee over sees with a lot of people w have some very american values stay with us gon the cursed generation e case o what politicize thousands s thousand people this much but they have dropped their norm alives nd the coming out every single week in to protest it is now been eighteen straight weeks take genifer for instance she somebody worked at abercrombian fitch during college show me in the blested protest that is whay r enguish is good somebody wanted to be a singer i yhoud got a chance to go pro when shoe a sixteen but mon quach lat saying was too much of a longshot an se you get an education and get a normal jobs genfer was actually varis surprise when e in formed her than an american parent i ta said the same exact thing o i thought k a backen dran tevy true sai pa ba is a watch glee wete t si had of thi is we watching internette save a college grad in or first office jod how did she end up protesting in the street every week an with tens or i maybe its hundreds of thousands or years ot for starters cgenivers twenty two which mans she is part of a special generation an hong kong an bor i hong conny nic i sefa rigt befor the hind ofer and here is a protestor were caling alice and i'm foin in nineteen ninety seven here is her friend t a ckong tiffany i'm also boy nine tinety seven you can collme you and im born an nineteen ninety seven nineteyn ninety seven i sa year when honcon was headed over back to china for the pritish he ga lis just pause on these twenty two yearolds for a minute for some quick history as you may are may not know honcong sits on the edge ir main land china i and was a british colony for a really long time starting in the nineteenth century and the finally nineteen ninety seven the british got out he handed it over to china and the idea was theise can be a fifty year transition period after fifty years china wild fully be in charge but during that fifty years hon cong would be a democracy now ho col people o to runhon co that is the last british governer of hng kong during the hand over ceremony in nineteen ninety seven that is the comis and that is the unshakable destiny and to be queer honcong had not been a democracy under britain but theywere ging to transition towards it of wer bunch of years and the hope was after fifty years in twenty forty seven the chinese government let them stay a democracy which it the time did not seem a crazy idea chine was opening up in all kinds of ways there was not quare how this was gon to playout and at the end of the day after fifty years in the our twenty forty seven china was going to be able to do whatever it wanted in hon ong these are the children born the year that cock started ticking and if you heard of the phrase curse generation yes sir it whats tis jok amoty nineteen i seven peopl it was he was pretty much a joke or pretty much a funny thing to us cas wen we firs joke about at ats rairly pri ra schools but at has taagon es just foin joking ourf all those years ir reginary the joke had to do with the coincidence theye were curse cause of some weird bad lock during some big childhood milstones sayl went through together the year of their kindogarden graduation the sars virus had hongkong and city shut down graduations were cancold six years later when he shuld hav had their elementary school graduation same thiyg happen again but a swine flew and genifan remembers that a friend joke tha when they graduated high school it was going to be a bola and that is when they started using the word cursed i think that was the time around the time the ja ca ralin well hireporter and the cist child ye many of us alwer the curst ca always say that we r the chosen whe as hirepote was to showse hit all of us lef hir mote we always a alwere the chosen when we have to face something byshowin er life or we are the curst to on we have to facesomtin at or face something significants genifers says i chosen one side of things didn really kickin till their senior year of high school ter's twenty fourteen they were seventeen the seventeenth year since the hand over and tht your people on hon congwer still expecting that manlin china was going to let them start holding full on elections with they could choose their own waiters as promised back in nineteen ninety seven and that year china announced it was not gon tohaka slad to a movement called the umbrelamivemen handed by young peopteen agers we worned to politics in this publischool classes that all these twenty two year olds talk about is being instrumental on he thinkin classes the beganas part of the hand of er call liberal studies classes ut explained among other things promises of nineteen ninety seven hen the rights as honcon citis ens t for t stret mosten for the first time emanding the roat carring umbrellas thousands of people in a vast procession down the street and pro testmovement that was almost entirely peaceful and they lst did not get the boat after three months the protest ended alice works for a moty national company in an ettry of a jaw about a college she is management trainase she sas she went to some protest back then out a solidarity with her peers i was just amazed by the other tudents but she de meny get all the politics a change his june when on cong introduced the bill that would allow mangland china to extradie people from hong kong to be tried and punished in china under chinese law this was sene is a new and very menacing en croachmen on the rights of hong kong citizens since inteyn ninety seven they have been ruled by hong kong gaws and hon kong courts everybody's presumed innocent with the rights we know in most democratic countries now anybody could get thrown into the prisons and courts of comminist chinacl i say that that that was the time when i first feel awaken when i'm truly understanding whatt happening when i first go to the mach of the no extradition bill and i was very very emotion nal at that time because there is only around seven million people an hong kong that one million vocon the street with the same de mont with the same wish as hoping hon con to remain it is currente day whenting honcong to stay lik it is with its on laws seperate from china a week later too many people came out at the time i was dilling very on my go tis is touching likewise feevle united and then the next second the gofermen just declares that oh we heard your voice that were we will be continuing on the bill on tisday that was a really big contrest and in the morning you see how piaceful things wer that and i you see to polis coming out and stopped brutally hitting people i was i it was really and forgetable to me because that was the first time when i witness with my real ahihsdat the polisitis chasing people they are chasing students who did not do anything and stoppe to bid them and arrest then other twenty twe year olds also told us how raticalizing its ban to see polase ter gessing and beating peaceful protesters and this point i understand this before we got to hong kong a lot of the emotion driving the protest it is just about the police because the government is departing them to do such things and there is no panalty pl them even if they are doing things that are completely and esceptible to every one beof course nobody knows whe this is gong to we by twenty forty seven when china fully takes op ver hong kong but for genifering lots of other people her age things were starting to feel pretty ominis was on con going to become just any other chinese city run by the communis when your fifty what do you pict yure life here will be i can pake chur that i will be superdepress caus i superlite commen on political thine i really cannot imagine the day that i cannot speak freely on internat that wiging i have that freedom of speech anymore and i cannot imagine that that will coma day me an my francs commenting on the gafermen wild become e crime and you think that would happen yes i do when lie all the things that is happening manage hinan now especially i wil say ini wheres sin tan shinson yan what is happening intin yon will happen hon kon shestaking about in turnman camps with the chinese are holding perhaps a million weagers an others they say is re education bat e spacically a concentration camp the pok people who does not who do not agreib with the government into the concentration camp and asial cate them and the ot monuture wherever and when ever they go everywhere is police police monuters everybody's move and i do sing that if we do not fight for our future that will comma day hone con will become sheja because shes piticare active this is not feel an abstract thread when thes twenty two yearolds picture who chinas gcon to crack down on it is them tifanys asso in her first job out college she orks at a bank sceast erester replace her voice with

sa and no need of sheis getting picked up i chanceon hea as e car woord way cross the street on queen's road there was an endless row of police vehicles head in the other directions as dozens of them blue and red lights flashing and his night went on things became violent the woman approached os som sidewalk upset about police beting somebody an showed us vidio the chee chout of it and the protessors revioin as well the newspapers sad accounts of six of them beating up a middle age man kicking and shouting at im this shet fire to ith subway station they do that a lot this lots of protestras the concon subway the em t ar colludes with police thas lik geniford prefers the buzs heve nos less convenient every pprotestor we interviewed supports the violets they supported because they feel they have no other options that i's the only way them get the government to respond to them f you told us back in june they march peacefully against the extradition bill got nothing then they got violent and the bill was withdrawn it worked a violence is become away to defend themselves setting fires and building barricades slows police who were coming after them they support the violence are they lase understand it manuel talked to thm about that were t at three of our shell an civil disobedience here is manuel when i started asking protestors about violence a couple of them said we are not violent americans our tallerance for it as much lower getting to this point to being o k with violence is in something we ded lightly and allowt of them explained to me that they di noways think radical tactics for oke what change their opinion was the way police responded to peaceful protest that being shot out with water canens cur gast seeing them un knocked unconscious beatem of the tans hin coffed and kicked grups of thugs beating and attacking people with hammers clubs and knives watching all this and being subjected to it that is what got a lot of people on board with violence now some protestors through a molatov cocktails thendelins buildings and chase police wis sticks and rods irer and i talked with one protestor you en do you think would be acceptable to the protestors to kill police i hope they do wye do i do if police died what do you think what happened next we will die too poltes sol di to and if things get that violent between the protestors and the police nd protestors are being killed do you think hon cong will get democracy i conto at the molwogs many people we talked with expected some one to die a protestor or police officer most thought it would help the movement put pressure on the government this has not happened yet but destruction and violence are giving way to bazaar scenes shroughout the city my coworker dian and i went to this protest in them ll whene a mony and honcon sometimes t entire city can feel one giant shiny shopping m al connected by someway the stores are all open them all is full of peopll thut not many people are shopping the entire premiss of this protest is to go to them all and not shop the mall is five s tore each teer has railings that look out over a central atriam they are families kids older folks some people are in black others are just in the regular dacloes they chant they seeng the protestor an them glory to hon con over and over at one point some onestartaining out paper n somdenly hundreds of people are folding paper cranes then anact of gentle vandlesem there is thes machine that princs our reservation reseats for the restaurant call jade garden the protestors high jacket forcing it to spit out hundreds over seates they tape the receipts together and string them from one end of the atriam to the other and back again a few times they target jade garden because one of the companies founders has a daughter this supports basing that is how far things have gone an hon con thers issis are labele t either yellow or blue yellow for the ones that support the protestors blue for the police and government there is even a guggle map that tells you if the business is one or the other soon things in the mall start to shift dian and i watch a group of about a dozen protestors enter a prochina bacery owned by the same company that own sjade garden they start taunting the staff i at baa that i blacas e ca eeli e a a ei a nac a ya a a was te was a managa the a a aa ee before things can escly any further the workers force the protestors out close the storegays and barricade themselves in a restless energy takes sover it is the protestors are looking for something to con front something to de sterb tbut the thing their finding against is the eccestential thread of china and that is not really in them all they march to more prochina business is in them all the alarm starts going off and i p announce ment ses the mall is very crowded please be careful then word comes police or on their way an some mood that feels a mixt of fear and a denalan fills the space rotes tors begin to buill barriers tat whateveris not nail of the ground blocking doorways prating opposticles they on stop the police from entering from the someway and france of them all it is arthering cass cans down thasplaters e group rips the six foot tb screen out of a wall to use ths part of the blockade the p announcement remains the same these be careful the mall is very crowded they open an emergency fire hose somemon brings giant jugs of oil which they add to the water the tile floor of the mall lobby is now a little lake that police will have to cross a woman slips and falls and while all this destruction is happening the shoppers the older folks even if fe families they do not leve there on the upper levels of them mall looking over the railing the atching a sporting event or something and superuncomfortable the protestor next to us can hi to oomoheor the police eventually come but they meet the protustors outside them all they throw to your gas protestrs tho a mall top coptaill e smoking gas woff through n be worl and many cin paron one of the malls of the levels gian statues of lines and copermenpati along with dozens of shoppers and protestors and lying out door balconies all watch the confrotation between police and protestors in fold below m there is ta thing that protest or say to each other never severties sometimes the even say never tater

went our program continues tismaric an lif f myr glass to day's program unbrella's up stories from honcong and what it is for people to live through over a hundred days of protest there i rave a t honcong with my co workers dian wo in a manual barry we have arrived at act four of our show act for good cop dad cop sore's an american visiting hong cong for the first time one n thinks a kind of killed me was hearing that before the last few years of protest people were really into the police they were trusted they were respected and it was only the last few years especially he less you months of protest ta changed all that at a rally act she saw people chanting at a row of cops that they hoped that they and their families would die and feelings about who decide with the police of the protestors they have gottin intense it is terring families apart on the telegram ap there is a whole channel for protestors who get kicked out by their parents and need a place to live allan new grow up in honcong he knows a family that is very far part on this the son is a protestor the dad is a retired police officer and alant had them sit down and do what nobody in honcongis doing talk to each other there is really no dialogue between police and protestrs anywhere in honcong as far as we could tell here is oun ihave known this family since i was six i knew then because of my friend jonathan i wrote the schoolbus with him everyday his falled a piece o whas the fo ust policeman on knew in real life i was excited tos foults of him because you never hear what the police think about the protests police here alot really allow to alk to the press peters retired but still very connected to the fors before the family all sat down together i asked peter to get together with me and my producer emanuel i had not seen him since i was twelve back then people call me yougan which means fishbor because the cantinys fo fish sounds mesterin a yeu and because i was fact i will not recognis you on te stret i will not i will not oer sirs after o e all right i i guess as a compliment that es we reco i have is were a fat as a kid i liked peter he take time of work to stop y during recess and bias chips another snacks my frend jonathan would have his burthty parties at the police station which we loved tig barbicus or the policemen around peter was the cool that people in hon con trusted even revealed the police fact then one of the most popular o te shows was a cop show horten seter were the police for heroes tew bpeter's har is gray now he is tall athletic he plays tennas by myn manickname in tennis i doft know why by nanin tennesis te federa better better teter roger raten i don' now why maybe my skill ananototonewhir ester likes is that jokes i cannot imagine peter ever doing what i've been seeing in these vidios peating up unarmed protestors kicking people on the ground i thought surely he would object to some of those things and that his views would be conplicated from what you have seen in resent months has sopein anything that the police o on tat you think you would disagree with nothing is perfect be s as a ho in general i seen the pouis at doing don a pretty good jo if it is in a the police force in other countries i just look at the carsuties look look just lok at the colum of fatal numbers it will not it will not be zero i asked him about different situations to police having criticise as g i even show him vidios of police brutally arresting people things i think are clearly wrong but he always seems to have a justification for the way police behave he says yount judging the police pas on what you see in these clips that is not fair you do not know what the officer was fatings the socio mediat only show the part the police hiting people but one minute a go they bete a check by loss of people one minute later the reat to to the to the mob in attacking them hat you can see is one minute after but you deed not see the full picture he is not conflics set about police and he is not very simpathetic to proctestors he thiks the protest of tistroying hong hong the expedition of this o ka he does not think china wul and free sfeecion hong ong and protesters fer of china is way overblown and i eve hon con bes par of china come on bik up people bic up di sis the fac where the china is good or bed hon con is par of china if you do not it those people waving the nestas fag waving the you din jeck fak if england tiks to oven goo t you in goo england iun go to forider good califonia yego go if trom ticto yeco i'd already been worried how this family conversation was going to go hearing what peter believed did not help peter told me he understands that jonathan goes the protest but does not ask him abouts it because he does not want any details jonathan said he does not ask his tad what he thinks of the way police beat in tou gas protesters for the same reason it jis if he says something she evr something thats complety doesm exsens to me i brings him down in as s as a person it just i woul te uses yed not not who i thought he was i in it lex gas you teli think that can be ye ocmo this family does not talk about the protest at all tennis yes sacker yes pat great but no politics till to night thif agreed its to haf the conversation they veen avoiding after thins jonathan'smarn houts or wachesst te dishes he i recognize the song rigt away i'm surprise she is homing an in front of peter its the protestors new anthem glory to hong hangs althan is on jonathan sine was eshe works with lawyers including som in the protemocracy camp it i ask if peter knows what that song is she says maybe yo in go that is kind of how its been going between her and her husband no real discussion but the occasional passive egressiv comment while they watching the news or some passive a gressiv comming during dishes this is another reason jonathan avoids bringing up the protests he does not want to stor the fight between his parents al worthe worse senario be som i moving out i guess yo because the constented any more ye i i guess living apart would be the worse case henrye i believe just that bi sort of and officially means thit you no longer to get u yo that cold be his man or his thad or him we all sit at dinner table i do not know why they agree to talk about this maybe just because i've known them for long an i ask or i hope maybe part of tham wanted to talk and i was just a good excuse peters facing me and jonathan and alta are next to me you no jonathan has their dalk lokey nam not of the mofvol character on his lag i iger am porinto the conversations tong es with all of them saying in different ways it is fine that we do not talk about this we all have mutual respect in wet tha mutal respect ther are tily o evil instead of talking to each other or looking at each other the talking to me or looking at the dag it feews all very careful proper and calm or this continues for half an hour then everything changes when peter uses the word on compromise aid compromiser call he hi hompromise tit pasically the government line ings that is what honcon's chief executive carry lamp says that the protestors should stop protest thing and aften that the two sides can talk mi alathan an jonathan hear that is meaning the protestors should back hour they both lay in sir peter tele wa tsera yerdi rangem comtentia rans ir tomaas aatean tat a ga talica jonteincin do o alpa says the police ae the oncs who need a change they have to calm the situation peter says the police are doing ther chobi do not know why when the police ares people for fighting or breaking stuff is treat us weard it is a legal soll a rested no pro a teople aa an the bodycoa go goba tanvacabody of fales an jonaphan says ok yes arresthem tut how much forced us the polace need to use sometimes the person just asks the police a question and they still get a rested or beaten o people who are already on the ground neron subdued they still get beaten w a tean peter does not respond ts then they argue openly argue for the first time about one of the protesters man the monssomething the government refused to mutch oner star and independent investigation into police behavior considy a but bue toge divated e athe peter keeps repeating the same thing over and over hesmen back in to a corner that there is no need for independent investigation nowwas on the right time ma o tho as a yorty tatsograsy oa the she cad already has a system in place or who investigate complaints about the police comin which ill on yor gon my zo tu to d they talk a little longer but it does not go anywhere alva tells me later she had other things she could have brought up but the sided against it she did not want her husbands a few traps the word she used was say ca which translates as that corna no place to go preserving the family was more importance to her than trying to win an argument later jonaphan told me he still loves his thad but he is given up hope that his father could be a reasonable human being at least when it comes to the police when i staugtsof this i was kind of mae i thought may be jonathan and his mother and father people who actually want to understand each other coul talk about this in a productive manner in that if they could maybe they was hope that the rst of us could but now i do not have a lot of caine is normoy reporter for the be which wy whati show the pus at five sbot to china what about ou the people living in koncong who have no problem of china who china this lat of

actually it is not really his seen he sees being this patriotic about china is kind of dorkey moreover el ways mu friendsi wen thever on o iv in china it yoursep there is a lothings in china that a i can a sat if i wus wo e forso it in china the two things he canic sep that we end of talking about are the lack of free speech and scensord access to the inner anatoa but the truth is i diven honcon and i get to rechain my almost on chac freedot with whene my years and tis such as sweet hot do fo hon con peovle and waited out to him that after twenty eight years it is very possible those freedoms would disappearas frethe and he had the same response that i heard from other people who do not the protests rus he was well sure oy maybe wel i yes si you talkin me to ot fe shu te ot e mus pes pect

the protests and his frustration was what hese experiencing in the city have driven him toat least try on this exstreme idea daniel's farty morksan fanans he lived in the uast for twelve years he s a foot buffian readh for the chicago bears as he likes the tenations anefents he says he was not politically involved in for all best wen to one of the big peaceful protest last sring marda watch than to peticipaon but that changed one day when he was watching alive stream of the young protestors storming the legislative counsil unples he was surprised how ferocious they seemed sow even the police officers looked a little scared that at that moment i somethey realas we atruter close to the revolution that coul huppen just never occur to me the hon con with go through that this both stun and ansirey about an know ans sid thint things can change abruptly tif the resen a revolution this can a forse to hand of the chinese government to crack down on it violently o and that anything can happen but yi i could lose all the privilege i have is on concidis protection of comminal freedhem oft speech but also freedem ust sbeech protected by common law and nobody thut enjoy these freedom but if the gest two ey a if it gust trus to important we can lose all of these privileges which our treasure he woke up the next morning to see that the coveridge was wall to wall about police brutality to daniel it seems every one was leaving out the fact that the protestors had started at which seemed deeply unjust to the police and tan thats when tha tot at tha turnin blue when the when i felt that the police wer me unfairly i to by si i chose to be on the police sit other people sited against the protest for different reasons e big one i heard was the destruption they caust the security guard told me he had to transfer four times to get home one night because of somewayshot downs he women trying to get cash out of an etiam that had been destroyed by protesters said if you rmat of the government take it out on the government theure only hurding people me a man said to me sadly hong cong is our home why are they destroying yet the crowd on the boat finishs belting out the national and on the second time when suddenly every one rushes to the ralime everyone crammed together on one side in a position that a little precarious thas kind of daniel's were ald right now he felt peshed to choose e team it are not these are his new people he does not think them exactly but he feels more alined with these chinese nationalists on the pout waving at the police then with the angry protesters paying up on them even if those cotestors ultimately on the same thing he does to preserved thei freedoms in o ho o tting on the upper duck of the sat ang this was actually the first time daniel had every sung the national yan them in ponpic he told me later hol as he sang he was surprised to find that he feud somfand we is the manageing et it ovoursel and she asa has one more story for us unget us at the sup it is act six of our sho at six two weeks later soctumber first was just a big day for supporters of mannan china if anything i think it was even more anticipated by pro democracy protestors the new china did not want to be embarrassed by demonstrations in hon con on that day such a beganniversary and in the weeks leading up to it several of them told us that they were worried what can a crack th almost going to come on october first i may be in the days befor it wtthe government try to shut them down i torn off the wek an before october first there were tuns of police under cover cop's posing his protesters surge in arrest and or noctober first something happened that several ffrend orviews ho predicted for the first time a protestor was shot but the real bullet a tea major the days after that thinks to send id the government ban wearing face masts in public which cause huge back lash in the streece another tee major fourteen year old was shot by police both te nat jusivived by the way a protestor slashed an officers neck with a box cutter a bomb went off next to a police car jani her the protessor that i went to the demonstration with the mid september she went to all those protest in the days before october first and then she was out on october first that big violent day and dian caught up with her the day after that october second to see i she was do it a to see what she man of it all i men up with janifer at the empti our station in chanouan on a wednesday she taken the empty ar only because she was in a big resh to meet me afterward on gan a fery long it it it is a really sat ter after yesterda she stalking about the protestor who was shot it actually happened just ta shartwalk from where wer standing the last few days of protest had been especially bad janifer was in the middle of the crowd when dozens of special attactics police officers exploded out of a hidden door sprinting after protesters and tackling them to the ground people had not seen this before it caused away with panic every one flood in terror including janafer her phone was flooded with images of arrested pro testers pinned on the ground byr rind police face down with their rists tied behind them later she met her friend the one who went to the protest with ira in her and found out that in the rest she got in trapped she came really close to getting arrested iout ifi sai that everything was close to me a feri wer a fen o min near any getting a rested and all the peers an foodagous i could see after to say everything just was was just too much for me i to clus yet janifers deeply fearful of getting arrested remember it could mean years in prisod after all of that on october first she was almost too scared to go protest but brave did anyways then plece started to firy to your gests that people up ahead of them we were on o way walking from ton one to quie home and i realize said i could not keep walking i started to realize that i i just feeld diferen li who we ta gowen i was and when i was with or i could do fee it is safe to run i'm going to be fine and i could de run without any hecitation but on bu yesterday i just seli i was terrified i started to shake from the either side and i did not know what to do she pannice started crying her boy friend helped her get home i had to leave yesterday but then actually on my way home there wasna friend mie i think you was just jo cane and say you left just he made behind he send this to me yso i was immediately cri ii cried out immediately and really could not control myself case i did not want this i i do not want to leave muc te mace behind i do not wont to leave any one behind but i do not want to be a burden and n autifi sar than yesterday i could not do any i get old the police strategy of clambing down on the pertest by outlying on most all of them then floding the streets with briet police and ar resting guns of people this is the tolit is taking and of course this is one way the whole thing cadain maybe little scar people off as i wy warward jonifer's boyfriend joe shows up he is got his shirt tucked in a new protest tactic from the sweet gain the ideas to try and exposes under cover police who would not be able to tuck their shirts in overe their guns in batons jos here for moral support be cause and credibly jonifer is now on her way to another protest

gi say was all very fritning until a few months later when the various investigators finally start reporting their findings that found no plot called operation trojan horse that seen no signs that any one had been ridiclized no evidence of violence or plan violence they dn't bring any terro chargers against anyone work in the schools theyd looked into but despy olrd of that des py finding no plot anvestigater still concluded that muslems hed influence o schools in a dangerous way gove my officials snapped into action hthings that should not have happened in our schools were alive to happen a children wre expose to things they should not have bee expose the full out has been huge frime minuts ta dayy camerinis wo that is calling a special meeting officials removed educators revammed

lors by making public sept to workers teachers and doctors part of the states o vatis uperators to night when form on their cool workers and students and patients to day the provading narrative ot the troja horse affair is that a benton wastems were up to nogit there is another vers of the stor to that vision of the troja horse affair is that nothing happened that the is baded round edugatrors were settep and the nation felt for it and salways seemed to me that this a simple way to figer out wher rady happened the letter even with al the government inquiries no authority no the investigators ev a figed out who wrote remarkably not them even tried and that to me seemed a pretty glaring overside the reason thet country was looking at these schools to suspicion the reason the wer investigate him at all was because this dodgy letto showed up for traing the people who worked there as nefarious plotters claim whin theye wase sneaking th slimin to schools a trojan horse the letter is what put the idea and authority's heads i did not see how you could know what operation trojan horse was or was not unless you gots to the bottom of the trojan horse thatter who wrote it and why a few years later i decided to go to school for investigate of journism but my professor was not completely sold on the story i wanted to report must tdodan project operation trojan horse this was investigative journism he wanted me to anot something new not rake over some years old story as a doctor them i'm familiar with the concept of a second opinion the ight before my masters was set to starp i went looking for one a doctor came to see me for a second opinion one night in fall twenty seventeen i'm in a theeter in birmingham after my py cass as town came out i went around doing some cuanas afterwards people w sometimes come back stage to chat and the skuy comes in introduces himself as hams a sird he said he was changing careers to become a reporter he was beginning a master's program and investigated journalsam the next day actially and he wanted some advice he was speaking fast i might walk away at any moment to be fair i was told that ihad five minutes o fine read after which i' be schooted out the building i did not know that anyway hamsar ran through the churghon horse story for me elevator pitch style i never heard of it but a guy was with back stage a produce rino from the b b c he had andhe jumped in as hamse was talking ye ye trojan horse he said that is a big thing a while ago some bad stuff went down muze meducators of ben oug to kno good but who is cleared up old story there was something hams as said though which afterwards i could not get out of my head he kept talking about a letter which had set off this whole cascade of consequences whose origins were still a mystery when i got home to new york i read the letter it looked a caricature of a missive between two terrorists filled with his lomophopic tropes about conniving and scheming muslems it is missing pages parts of it are too dark to read ie got jamned in the zeroc's machine it instructs the recipient to destroy it after reading it struck me as a funky document for a government to take seriously especially because from what i read the government had not even looked into who wrote the letter or why there was a strange lack of curiosity about this instigating document i thought to myself seems somebody should try to figure who wrote that thing and then i thought we wait this journalism s tudents doing that maybe i had a give ma hand and here we are years later at the end of a dizzy farcicle and enraging investigation and which one mystery led to another led to another tracing this letters path ofe destruction across multiple con and defiance of many an hav the officials and some a gressive attempt to shut ou wrpoian down from serial productions and the new york to i'm bryan w i'm hom tosiece presenting to you the most elaborate student project at this is the trojan horse affair i goght the coll from bryan while i was in class my phone stoted ringing from a new york numba i asked my professor if i could take it he said no i sked a pocacal use it toilet he said

a been talking about wanting to be a governor of a recent wedding and s parents cout wind it w resentment and frustration ad been fastering for years among parents an ou rark who been trying and trying to get the authorities to do something about the dismal schools thes parents at the hear's door had joind the park for governing body in an attempt to make a change but they did not speak fluent english and had not gone university to her was a professional with the degree who still lived in the neighbourhood we loved to proposou they told him and with that to hear found himself at the next governing body meeting of parkfew school being voted in not only as a member but as the chair that is when i became a governor on the seventh of january nineteen nineteen seven he remember the date ye av what i was a was to remain there for eighteen years when to her started parkfew was one of the worst secondary schools in the country only four percent of students were passing four per cent the national school inspection agency had recently placed the school into special measures the lowest possible ranking and emergency stadas basically meating parkfy was in danger of being shut down there were brawls breaking out in the school yard on a toware the building t hear saw vandalized bath rooms with stalls missing locks and toilets missing seats but were to hear really trained is focus was on the complacent teachers and administrators we initially just startled by saying that o is y children should be achieving fire though the achievement was not acceptable and the fact that the school was to blame for for the falure this statement obvious to to hear that the kids and alam rach were his capables kids anywhere was met with massive resistants e was very difficultetting the school to accept the they were the problem tpeople did not want to accept that because they were that that they been blaming the community ful an may be tru decates they had such a low expectation of children one thing to hear noticed urlyan was that the staff of this school with nearly ninety per cent packastany students had only one full time packastany muslen teacher to here began searching for more moslem staff and governors he gave presentacions held work shops he became a fixture at events surroundy spirming hem standing behind his little table or booth e vangelizing for people to get involved in their local schools i lofty a ha ha i loved i i the children the is e i felt as i could make a difference this is mas who saying the first moslem teacher to hear hired he taught mast i could use my langud age my background wandestanding awere they come from to make a difference i knew their families mascan point to ha specific moment by the way when he decided to go in to teaching there is a panerone program i called an unde classing pot of tha powerful segment mas wo saying says from the very beginning he encounted seros prejudices among the most y white staff i a grup the childrenlone to me and thes sed that lisies wone teachen in school he always calls us packies he sees collingis packeesis to g in the jokee way but we find the offensive then i would tell any one else with the telling me that look thes tese swating attus that is as let in any context but especially shocking for a teacher to say to packsany students mosdol dam i think the best thing to do hapy parents rit the school he tolked thim to the preceger for doing them in case the pparents didit know he says eventually the school looked in to the teachers behavior and while you investigating a he designe and he gav thes final leaving speech n the staff room angls he should be acal cho domina in thi school not the kits andhe finih off with the words the west is the best and old teachis claft old teachis cleft the racism was pervasive rosuin feras a former governor and math teacher say it wone of his first governing body meetings he was shown a list of places the students had been given work placements through a program at the school and it was all restaurants supermarkets clothing sthoores and it was no e gre docto setre alophamo anything that and i sid ina how is it that that did the children desined these and ras on says the vice chair told him well the apparents want them to goin becom doctos an engineers an ec centra u reanities these kids will become texidra is shop keepers we have gon to prepare them now and for a good while i was struggling to process what he was saying this is me a brown person an amoslin and he saying to me that they deserve to have these kind of jobs this is this communities rolin society ais that is ray we just file the kids we just file the kids and did e fel about about it didnt te we didn' w di li feel gosy john brachley was one of the non muslin teachers at parkview he was a mateacher who would beenter since the adies he was frank with us about the bigotry that he and his colleagues helld towards the students and their families an we we we we that we were a superior culte ind we look down we look down anl these people who did not know about education your tucking ot yourself here soon about myself armost out tolking about oun a many of the people ar walways the teachers attitudes are documented by the way a former head teacher of parkview a head teacher is what we americans call a principal did a masters thesis while he was at the school for which he collected opinions from the staff including from john as to wy muslem children were drastically under performing compared to their peers in the thesis teachers say the kids parents are ignorant wrongly claim the students tod speak english the teachers try for a while on teacher said but end of feeling who gives a dam that is a quote it makes john cringe to think back on it the sawy when move wiles from the situation that the e tikom you can realize o l for the is i do not nonly think about ababout the think is 'm it is to embarrassin once we created the shift in the belief of the teachers then ti job became much easier ther says by theirty two thousands parkview was changing the school began taking basic but transformative steps setting individualise

get label the leader of an extremist conspiracy simply by raising tescoresthat your neighbourhood secondary school the main accusation against to her alam the overarching assertion of the trosan horse letter which the government supported and which is defined to hear his reputations since then is that he was islemizing schools this is not a word a'm particularly fond of islamize because is the mise an relation of what some assumed non aslomic base line has this story been insomized by hamsas invalvement yes it is a word that is not inherently negative but gets used that way any way that is what the letter said to here was doing is lo mizing schools and funnally enough it is also what te her says he was doing we were valuing the cultural and the faith background of the children and we were lying that to be expressl if you we cated for children they could perform there in a daytime prayers if they wanted to a we made ta prayer facility available for them in a room religious commodations this are legal and british schools by the way whether there explicitly designated as a religious school and i which park few was not it was the ecuivalent of a regular public school in the youass and since ninety at per send o the children happened to be of these lomming faith background we obviously a catring for the constituency that the school servs in mine with the regulatry a requirements

would declare that the way the har in his colleages wor running parkfy school i under mind coon call british values hat they were limiting the childrens ability to thrive an modern brin which an

roughly what the uesh controls to day i know this is somewhat of an apples and orangeous comparison because the world was not organized into a globliz economy back then but it does show how rich india was and relation to other countries at the time when the british left the indians of continent after some two hundred years of economic exploitation indian parks ton ore among the poorist nations in the world i din't learned the stoff in school because brn's colonization of a carter of the planit is not composr part of the national coricadem which why i only discovered as an adold i much to the

during a tan ining a home an a mi schools ea li i do n ani to have a different life as a when in yif find if im paing a hoa when a peras oli as a i these are two students who graduated from parks to you in twenty fourteen when i using their names because such is the stink of the churshan horse scandal they dow n't petential employers to know where they went to school they actually keep it off their resimes when hams and i met them four years after they graduated they were both soding law university some of the first in their famblies to go on to higher education they been best friends since school the kind of friend ho do not ned words to communicate as yet i i itent this atha wi e i thi thiy thi the students told us about these assemblies they would have in the mornings hich included religious teachings and sometimes prayer they wi i this is something that has an american made me do a double take when i first heard about it they idea of teachers an a public school leading prayers during in assembly is not normal to us but in britain there is no separation between church an state the queen is head of both not only is prayer aloud in schools some form of worship is legally mandated in all schools that are publicly funded schools do not always adhere to this but students are spose to take part and was called tha daily act ove collective worship by dfall it spos

still he another former colleges told us they wished the here was a bit more circumspect in the way he went around to other schools advocating for reform he was self assured blunt and particularly and

for yourself the fact that some people may not be ok her it that he said if fer esa easy relevant to me that their problem an two thausn't in twelve bart you received the ultim of valitation what was probany ts proudist moment in the heres nealy eighteen yeas there offs that arrived for an inspection and deemed the school out standing the highest writing possible among the many things inspect os praise depart or you bit the quot whide range of opportunities for sprt to a development including voluntary friday prayers in his time as cero governors the hare had taken part you from the lowest ranking the buge of closia to the very top the parson in charge o ostead chief inspecto said quote every school in the country should be this less than two years later on november twenty seventh twenty thirteen an envelope arrived on the desk of the leader of birmingham cite council a man named sir albert bore inside was a cover sheet addressed to him marked very important confidential mister bore it said this ltter was found when i was clearing my bosses files and i think you should be aware that i am shocked at what your officers are doing you have seven days to investigate this matter after which it will be sent to a national newspaper who i am sure will treat it seriously sincerely a n anonymous presumably behind that note was the trojan horse letter four poorly copied pages shadows at the edges instructions to destroy after reading the letter was written as if from a collaborator of to hears describing a conspiracy to heare had been running to take over and islemiz schools by deception it took weeks for to hear to learn about it he heard rumors there was a mysterious letter making its way around birmingham around the city counsil in to head teachers in town which named him as the orchestrator of a plot one of to hear his friends rush to his house to tell him that had been getting a hair cutt over on washwood heath road and after wards his friend's barber had beckoned him into the back room in the shop and showed him a copy to hear did not know what to make of it finally he got hold of the document himself youn obviously i was thinking what is the source of this letter who wrote this letter why was this letter written is wost ringing in my head the front page was missing there was no dear whoever it destrarted as if ithad been going on for a page or more ready and the letter ended mid sentence too whith the phrase i would also there is no sign off which meant to hear could not tell exactly who was pose to be two or from but whoever wrote the letter said explicitly to here and i i supposed to be from somebody who knows me well in bermingham and he is talking to somebody in bradfond another british city that is home to a lot of muslims he is talking about to here what he is done here we can do over ther an he is your friend or your yes fosi who hav whoever it is yer can you keep reading just the first few paragraphs o he operation trogan horse has been carefully thought through and is tried and tested within bermingham to here and i would be happy to sport your efforts in bredfort this is a long turn plan and one which we are shore we lead to great success in taking over number of schools and insuring that they are rone on the strict is lomic principles in bermingham the benefits the main tactic of operation trojan horse is to target head teachers at the schools you want to take control of to make their lives miserable that thell resign or else be fired at which point you can install your own people who will implant islomic extremism in the school the auther gives several examples of schools in birmingh nd were to hear in his cronies were supposally in the mddle of doing this we have caused a great amount of organized disruption in birmingham the letter says and are on the way to getting rid of more head teachers and taking over their schools whils sometimes the practices we use may not seem the correct way to do things you must remember that this is a jehad and as such using all means possible to win the war is acceptable what was your feeling are your attitude were you laughing at it were you actually kind of taking it seriously and frightened what wening then lan i i was not laughing actually because i knew the serious nature of the alegations that were being made but as far as the claims oes the themselves are cencerne they were laughable i knew that there was something not right what was going on here to her contact of the burming ham city council were the letter was first sent he done training for them for years in as it look i work for you and this letter apparently's going around tlay ming certain things and i'm surprised that you have not spoken to me to at least to get my view on the matter at least ask me to explain all if i know anything or whatever something and the gentlemen there actually from this city council he said mister lam to be to be very honestwyh you we do not think anything of the letter we think it is a completely botis i hokes letter and wede we do not believe there is any truth in it and therefore we did not take any action we did not do anything with it did you feel reassured by that or and not really know because then the letter began to be printed in the national media as well some one leek the letter to the sunday times of london and from there it became friendy one story an t to tanddosins in dat mell telegraph espectati sci te many of them giving creetens to the letter saying the extremeistic to here had inlege infor trating you car schools for years recort is campt outside part view this do not t here don the street we tried to put these aligations to the academies chair of governers but to hey ala timed abot his house le misterlam mistera la the govln ment gictinto cate to investigate tho swormd park vie ofsted the schood inspector arrived wot two surprise inspections and then we had the education from thegagency investigation which was about tendays i thing theye were in there for ten days and soon as they left we had the pedom you see price wortr house coopers a big outside ordzingfim looking into the financialist affairs of the school then we have them a for for five weeks in the school as wen a said what are you looking for a id ply what are you looking for you bing here three weeks you must have a family there was more the secretary of state for education called in england's former counter terror chief from scotland yard a man named peter clark and the burning ham city council appointed its own special investigator and they scrutinized park view along the twenty some ot other schools and muslen eighborhoods in the middle of the maylay some politicions and journalist were saying that the letter itself was likely a hoaks there wase some obvious factual and accuracies yet the government believed it still warranted this action honestly i do not think any authority explain this logic with much clarity at the time but my understanding of how the thinking went as it even if the letter itself was not an actual communicay between two real life conspirators it could still be pointing at a real problem even if it was fiction the thinking went the letter could hav been fabricated by some one who had legitimate concerns about muslem extremests scheming and wielding influence in schools and maybe the letter was their creative way of raising an alarm rather than look into who wrote the letter and why instead the government put out general public cauls for information about these schools and people started coming forward mostly anonymously with com plaints again investigators found no evidence of radicalization no evidence of violen extremism and no plot what emerged instead was a canic rab bag of is lom adjacent alligations many of the same things authorities had celebrated up to that point but apparently now were seeing in a different light these educators were not merely allowing students to pray they were pressuring them to pray they were not innocently recruiting bround muslim staff they were hiring their buddies who thought the same way as they did and possibly discriminating against nonmuslem candidates in the process school governors including to hear they were not holding head teachers to a high standard they were pressuring them harassing them and exercising more power than a governor was sposed to investigators also said they would found instances of intolerance towards elgi biticupeople and unequal treatment of women and girls they said parkfiew id held assemblies and invited speakers with anti western views and that the hear and people alined with him a legedly subscribed to quote and in tolerant and politicized form of extreme social conservatism that claims to represent and ultimately seeks to control all muslims all of this at the then secretary of state for education put it tat she presented the findings on the churge in horse letter to parliaments ment that students instead of enjoying abroldening and inriching experience in school young people are having that harisons narrite an olbing denied opportunity to flarise in a morti mo to couchoverson iit is wut is reason and with deep sense of injustice and sadness that to day we are noucy are intention to resign our positions a paou education of trust an ala ou members tos humorous posibility after months of scrudiny and early july twenty for teen to hear looking tired and stressed stood elector outside parkvewscates and resigned to heare told us he and the other parkvew governors only agreed to do that because the deparmen for education promise that the head teacher and other on the ground leadership of the school would be kept in place but tas sooners ar school opened in september all of those people was suspended all the leadiship was spasic mesect ruitslessly they went about destroyi the cary is destroying the reputations and they did that systematic we had worked for ten fifteen years rely to build this school they destroyed it within months the government rename the school it is no longer park view it also notified nearly every teacher in governor you just heard from to here included that was bringing proceedings to band them from education for the rest of their lives in the years since student achievement has plumeted at the school formerly known as park view from more than seventy per cent passing two in recent years from the low forty to mid fifty per cent range ase storye the head told us that fast meeting and its makeshift toten room that this letter which is never footi investigated that described a plot calld operation trogeon horse which never found to ive existed inspired old of this the rrning of careers and an educationat movement the famongring had lines against must ims that continued to distay the government instituting podicies that encogust despimle brazen own each other wel been tolk him with

the is a lot to non o don gi id into cinitiitrity ar new pobty could tell e som talk about that you no you begin to realliv it isnit and i have to say that he does an it does seddenmy aciy as what has been lost for the children for the community the irreparable damage that has been done for absolutely no reason whatsoever sany me cannot gev you that sir some te of something at that event i went to wer we all got re directed to the wedding h wont the speakers a cimaistan pee to opone wet it well he said operation trogiol horse has become a social fact in breten that even houghwithin weeks of the trogio horse that i hitting the news people acknowledge was probably hoks tht's never seemed to matter wet the mostoms in bermingam were conspiring or not does not matter theintimation at their work has persapered to te extent the primanist as former chief ofstaff was outrage that some people in a communit center wuld dad say otherwise but we do not need to sell for a social fact because they are actual facts why up to this point has no one cared about who wrote this letter and where this letter came from whel that is my question that is mi ly sty what i've been arguing this is why i went to the police to see what they could to this is what i said wrote in my letter to the burbingham city council that you need to get to the bottom of who wrote the letter this is what i wrote to the department of education as well you need to get to the bottom of the letter who wrote the letter because the wel than unravel why the letter was written you see this is what i've been arguing but the parment f education is not interested the police are not interested the burbiam city council is not interested in answering that question why because they have used this letter and on this hokes they have built much policy do you think now they want to launch an investigation in to the letter to have it proven that he was written for completely different reasons yer how would that make them look but your monkeys as i've been sain if you could just find out who wrote that letter why that is the only thing that might change frencs understanding of operation trocial horse but weever wrote the letter they the they they knew an yothey knew me i think andan i to think that i know them too t is that he knew t i have a strong huncest wo who wrote the letter you knw i strongly believe that i know who wrote the letter and i strongly believe that i know the wife of the letter was written this wone i you think the who and the motive yes that is next on the thogia horse affair that is by ine

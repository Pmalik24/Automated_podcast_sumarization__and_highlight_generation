welcome to the huberman laponen a science science pace to ne r i man drew hubermen and on a professor of neurobology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor a lea crum doctor crum is a tenord professor of psychology at stamford university and the founder and director of the stamford mind and body lab her work focases on mind sets how what we think in what we believe shapes the way that our physiology our biology reacts to things what we eat or stress or exercise indeed as you will soon learn from my discussion with doctor crum what you believe about the neutritional content of your food changes the way that food impacts your brain and body to a remarkable degree and the same is true for mind sets about exercise and stress and even medication for instance recent work from doctor crum's laboratory shows that what we believe about the side effect profiles of different drug treatments or different behavioral treatments has a profound impact on how quickly those treatments work and the effectiveness of those treatments just want to mention one particular study that just came out from a graduate student in doctor crum's laboratory lorin how acho w e showed that how kids react to a treatment for penut alogies can be profoundly shaped by whether not those kids were educated about the side effects of the treatment such that if they learne tha the side effects where a by product of a treatment that would help them and they learned a little bit about why those pside effects arose and that the sideeffects might even help them in roote to overcoming their penatalogy had an an enormous impact on how quickly they move through the treatment and indeed how much they suffered or in this case did not suffer from those side effects and that is but one example that you will learn about to day as we discuss what mind sets are than number of different mind sets that exist and how we can adopt mind sets that make us more adaptive more effective allow us to suffer less and to perform better in all aspects of life i personally find the work of doctor eleacrum to be among the most important work being done in the fields of biology and psychology and the interface of mind body everything that she is done up until now and published and indeed the work that she continues to do has shaped everything within my daily routines within my work routines within my thletic routines and we probly sholdn' be surprised by the fact that doctor crom works on all these things she was not only an incredibly accomplishd tenured research professor she is also a clenical psychologist and she was also a division one athlete and a eleat gymnist at one period in her life she really walks the walk in terms of understanding what mind sets are and applying them in different aspects of life i'm sure you are going to learn a ton from this conversation as did i and come away with many many actionable items that you can apply in your own life in fact as we march into to day's conversation you might wanted just put in thebaccur mind the question what is my mind set about blank for instance ask yourself what is my mind set about stress what is my mind seid about food wha is my mind said about exercise what is my mind said about relationships of different kinds because in doing that you willbe in a great position to extract the best of the information that doctor crom presents and indeed to adapt those mind sets in the way this can be most beneficial for you before we begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching ind research rolls t stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponser is athletic greens at letic greens is an all in one vitemen mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reasen i started taking athletic greens on th reason i still take athletigrens once or twice to day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutricional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has probiotics which our vital for microbiom health i've done a couple of episodes now on the called gop microbiom and the ways in which the microbum interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without letic greens it get the vitemens i need the minerals i need end the probiocs to support my microbiom if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic greenstock com slash hubermen and claim a special offer theu'llgive you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of dat and ow showing that vitemend three is essensial for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wor getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficien in vitemen d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stock com slash hubermen to claim the special offer of the fivfree travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element element is an electrolike drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact ratioes of electrolytes are in elements and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar ave talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration and electrolites for nerve sell function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium in potassium present in the proparatioes all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolites are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration end that your getting the proparatios of electrolites if youd to try element you can go to drink element that is element doc com slash hubermen nd you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase they are all delicious again if you want a try elemen you can go to element el amente tat calm at slash he rrem and now my conversation with doctor a lea crom great to have you here e great diveer for the record it is a leacrom but you go by ally crit that is curait doctor alycrom i jus dally o c t well i've been looking forwar to talking you for a long time just to start off talk to lot and worked a lot on the science of mind sets could you define for us what is a mind set and what sort of purpose does it serve of course yet mind sets have been described or defined in a lot of ways we define minds ets as corbelief sir assumptions that we have about a demain or category of things that oriends us to a particular set of expectations explanations and gulls that is kind of jargan lettle i can a distill it down for use of minds sets are an assumption that you make about a domain take strss for example the nature of stress what is your sort of cor belief about that and mind sets that we have studied about stress are do you viewstresses enhancing good for you r adiew viewid as debilitating and bad for you those minds uts those cor beliefs orient ar thinking they change what we expect will happen to us when we are stressd how we explain the occurrences that happen or unfolds an we are stress and also change are motivation for what we engage in when we are stress as we have mind sts about many things mind us about stress minds es about intelligence as carol waxwork has shown mind es about food mind us about medicin you name it at sort of distilling down those corassumptions that really shape and orient are thinking in action i ford you say before that mind set simplify life consome way by constraining the number of things that we have to consider om and it sounds to me we can have mind sets about many things as as you said what are some different mind sets i think a many people are familiar with our collee carol dwexs a notion of growth mind set that if we are not profission it is something that at we should think about not being proficient yet that we are on some path to proficiency but what are some examples of mind sets om and howardly do these get laid down or do we learn them from our parents o may be n gust on fleshin out a bit for us and terms of what use what you have observed in your own science or your own life even yes sure i think it is impartent with with carol waxwark a lot of people contig get focus on growthsmotivation an lalthese things but her work really originated from thinking about what she call this implicit theories or corbeliefs about the nature of intelligence are ability it is a do you believe that your baseline levels of intelligence or your abilities are fixed satic set throughout the rest of your life or do you believe that they can grow and change now those are over simplified generalisations about the nature of intelligence and the reality is as it always is complex in its a bit aboth an it is all thethings but as humans we need these simplifying systems to healp us understand a complex reality those assumptions that we jump to oh intelligence is fixed or intelligence is malliable a they help us to simplify this complex reality but they are not in consecunconsequential they they matter in shaping our motivation and as she has shown if you have the mind st that intelligence is malliable you are modivated to work harder to grow yor intelligence if you have a set back in your learning you think okay there is something there that i can grow and learn and build from if you have the mind set that it is fixed why work harder at math if you do not think you are good at it in retrospect its pretty clear how these mind sets can effect our motivation what our work has aimed to do is to expand the range of mind sets that we are a studying focused on and also understand and expand the range of effects that they have bhy and large we have focussed on mind sets in the domain of health and health behaviors a i mentioned in mind sets about stress we have also looked at mind sets about food and healthy eating do you have the mind set that foods that are good for you healthy foods are disgusting and depriving or do you have the mind set that healthy foods are indulgent and delicious now it could be avariet or different foods you might have different thoughts about different healthy foods but generally people at least in our culture in in the west have this view that stresses debilitating healthy foods theire disgusting and depriving and those mind sets whether are not theire true or false right or wrong they have an impact and they havenat impact not just through the modivational mechanisms that dwack and others have studied but as our lab is started to reveal they also shape physiological mechanisms by changing what our bodies prioratize and prepare to do a those are just two examples mind sets about strass mindsits about food we have looked at mind sets about exercised you feel you are getting enough or do you feel you are getting in insufficient amount to get the health benefits your seeking a mind sets about illness do you view cancer as in unmitigated catastrophy or do yof you cancer as manageable or perhaps yeuv been even an opportunity ah we have looked hat mind sets about symptoms and side effects do you views side effectes a sin that the treatment is is harmful or do you viewside effects as a sign that the treatment is working again these are sort of cor beliefs or assumptions you have about these domains or categories ah but they matter because their shaping their symphesizing and symplifying the way were thinking but theyre also shaping what we are paying attention to what we are motivated to do and potentially even how our bodiy's respond now om and love to talk about this notion power a the mind sut shaping how our bodi's respond and a maybe as an example this if you could sure with us this now famous study that a yeur you have done with a milkshake study you on when my thuring the majur you contors of that study an the results caus i think the extremely impressive an they really speak to this interplay between mind se and physiology certainly yet this was a study that i ran as a graduate student at yale university i was working with kelly brownell and peter salave peter salave had done a lot of work on really cointing the term emotional intelligence tay oteras of you heis now li resitent aayd he is done he is he is done well for himself and for the university and society aand calli brownell who was doing a lot of research on food and obisity and i had come in doing some previous work on mind suts about exercise and plicibo effects and exercise and was in this sort of food domain and this emotions and food domain and it really occurred to me that there was a very simple question that had not been probed yet and that was do our beliefs about what we are eating change our bodies physiological response to that food holding constant the objective new trance of that thing that question might sound outrage a at first but it was it is really not outrageous if youre coming from a place of having studied an depth placibo effects a plicibo effects are this ro in medicine at least are this sort of robust deminate demonstration an which simply taking a sugar pill thinkig nothing under the impression that it is a real medication that might relieve your asma reduced your blood pressire and boost germian system can lead to those physiological effects even though there is now objective new trance and we have more evidence on plicibo effects than we have for any other drug gas of because of the cinical trial process in which all new drugs and medication our medications are required to out perform a plicibo effects o we have a lot of data on the placibo effect now ye enou we can get new aunts there we do not have a lot of data comparing the plicibo effect to doing nothing ah which is important fora di stilling mind sed effects are belief effects from sort of natural occurring changes and the body but anyway's going back to this question it was areit we have moved from you kno medications solving our health crises to behaviour on medicine solving our health of crises increase people's exercise get them to eat better to what degree are these things influenced by our mind sets or beliefs about them to test this question we ran a seemingly simple study this was done at the yale sentrefor a clinical and translational research and we brought people into our lab under the impression that we were designing different milkshakes with vastly different metabolic concentrations neutrient concentrations a that we are designed to meet different metabolic needs of the patrons of the hospital r it you are goin to come in you are gin a tasthese milkshakes and we are gin a measure your bodies physiological response to them this was a within subjects desine was the same people a consuming to different milkshakes two different time points separated by a week and at one time point they were told that they were consuming this really high fat high coloric indulgent milkshakeitwas six hundred twenty calory superhigh fat and sugar the other time point they were told that it was a low fat low calory sensible sort of diet shake in reality it was the exact same shake it was right in the middles three hundred calor hace moderate amount of fats and sugars and we were measuring their bodies got peptied response to this shake and in particular we were looking at the hormone grellin as grellan a hunger a medical exports calld the hunger hormone ret rises in grelland signal seek out food a and then theoretically in proportion the amount of calories you consume grellan levels drops signalling to the brain oca you do not you can only to eat much any more you can stop eating and also reving up the metabolism to burn the neutrians that were just in jested what we found in the study was that when people thought they were consuming the high fat high calory indulgent milkshake in response to the shake theire grellan levels dropped at a threefold rate stronger than when they thought they were consuming the sensible shake essentially their bodies responded as if they had consumed more food even that was the exact shan same shake at both time points this was really a interesting and important a for two reasons really one was that it was to my knowledge one of the first studies to show any effacts of just believing that you are eating something different on your physiology lots of studies had show have shown that believing you are eating different things changes your taste in you are even your satisfaction in fullness after but this shows that it has a metabolicer o physiological component a but the second piece was really important as well a n especially for me this was one study that early transformed the way i think about how i approach eating and that was the manner in which it affected our physiology was somewhat counter intuitive i had gone in thinking the better minds at to bein when you eat as i you are eating healthy right ni e ot just make sense lik pleceem effects think you'r hel they 'll be outhey ano but was a far too simplistic way of thinking about it and in fact it was the exact opposite because thinking that they were eating when these a particibens thght they were eating sensibly their bodies left them still feeling physiologically hungry oar not satiated which could potentially be corresponding to lslower metabolism in for if you are in the interest of maintaining or losing weight what is the best mines at to be in its to be in the mincs that they yu're eating indulgently that you are having enough that you are getting enough i'm an at least i not study me show that as the maredat of a fact on grellin responses interesting and especially interesting to me as a narrow scientist who has worked on aspects of the nervous system thetr involved in conscious perception vision and a emotion and color perception and forth but also ar lav is worked a and is increasingly working on autonomic funscionce there below our conscious detection in this case i a a lie about how much something a a this milk shakes contain affected a subconscious process because i have to imagine that the grellin pathway is not one that i can decide oh this a particular piece of chocolate is can really reduced my grelland cause it is very neutrat rich i suppose to one if you told me that a different piece of chocolate for instances i lut low caloryor or sugarfree chocolate or something that sort the grillin pathway however it seems based on your data that the grillin pathway is susceptible to thoughts which is incredible but then again there must be cross over between conscious thought and these subconscious or i can of autonomic pathway th rilly remarkable a i it raises a question that a a i just have to ask because it increasingly i'm ainvolved in in a unlying discussions and the social median one of the most barbed wire topics out there and that is beeng generous is this topic of which diet were neutrients are best you have got people who are strictly plant based you have got people who are ominivres you got people who are carnivores you have every variation you ove intermitten fasting alsocal time restricted feeding and it seems once a group and a plugs in to a a particular mode of eating that they feel works for them for whatever reason energy wise mentally maybe thei'r look ing their blood profiles may be there not but once they feel that sort of am it works for them each camp seems to tout all the health benefits and how great they feel could it be that mind set effects are it involved there that people are finding the nutritional program that they feel brings them the most a enrichment of life but also neutrience and that their health real you shifting in a posiive direction but not necessarily because of the frud constituents but because of the community in the ideas in the reinforcement ond the belief that this is the right way of doing something i i think hundr per cent a hundred percentent has something to contribute i do not want a i'm m ging away in on the debate wud out i will most certainly laig in on is is the notion that look going back to the placibo effectorit we have a outdated understanding of what that is which is based on this randomized control trial you compare a drug to a placibo if the drug works better than the placiba you say great the drug works if the drug does not out perform the placibo you say the drug does not work that is really over simplified it is a good test for the specific efficacy of the drug it is not a good test for understanding the total impact of that drug because in the reality of things if a drug out performs a placibo then you start prescribing it but you the reality is that the total effect of that drug is a combined product of the specific chemical attributes of that drug and whatever's going on in the plaib effect which is at least from our perspective its beliefs it is social contect and it is your body's natural ability to respond to something that is in the placibo effect example the same is true for everything we do or consumed when it comes to what diet you are yeu're eating both are true it does matter what it is and it matters what you think about that diet and what others around you in an our culture think about that diet because those social contects in form our mind sects our mind sets interact with our physiology in ways that produce outcomes that are really important let us not get dualistic and say it is either all in the mind or not in a mind let us also not be unnecessarily combative and sayoh it should be all plant based are ou know quito or whatever it is all of those things are a combined product of what you are actually doing and what you are thinking avou if you believe in it if you do not if you are skeptical or in some cases you think you should be eani eating a certain way and then you do not live up to that it might have a an adverse effect because of the the stress in the anxiety associated with that very interesting am alln the lines of belief effects is it c we call these belief effects ire on yet is there a difference between these what i'm calling belief offects and placibo effects and ur placibe effects distinctly different from mind sat effects were they more lessless the're they related i think placib effects imaybe should be reserved for the conditions in which youre actually taking a placibo it is a inactive substance when you get out of that sort of placibo firses drug realm and you start looking at placibo effects that yuse cloths with my hands here in behavioral health the term kind of bit comes confusing because you are not the milkshik study we did not give people a placibo milkshake rigt we just changed what they believed about it how i to think about it is that placibo effects as their traditionally construed are made up of three things its the social contects mind sets or beliefs and the natural physiological processies in the brain embody that can produce the outcomes a and we could could just call them belief effects because the beliefs are triggering the physiological processies and the beliefs are shaped by the social contects does not make send amake sense yethe other is a paper a yeur two go publishin siets a sent magazine about bran regions involved in psychogenic fever that if people were you can notshe dtise an animal models toyou think that they are sik you get a genuine one do three degree increase in body temped or threet one 's three tgrees for night increase of mi to which is pretty pretty impressive yo the gus plasintas symptomology generally i'm a believer in belief effects ell it is also gand i just say that you knon't the term that we is in the in our field is no sibo a fact for that whith a sort of the placibos ugly step sister he know its when negative beliefs cause negative consequences you are told you will have thikno it is it is very well demonstrated that when people are told about certain side effects ther far more likely to experience of side effcts when people think that theyr sick are going to get sick sometimes that can create the physiological a symptoms and there is there is verius debates that it is not only that physiology changes its also that your attention changes we are experiencing things a pfatigue and headache and upset stomach all the time and then when you take a drug in somemany says you aregin a feel fatigue and headache you start noticing that your tire an avheadaches and attribute it to the drug some of the mechanisms are attention and some of them are real changes in in physiology the a free to tell s about a the hotel workers study sire and the get out these questions i'll tine when i find these just these results also amazing yet no i think that this is a really good example of this phenomenon rigt that the total effect of anything is a combined product of what you are doing and what you think about what you are doing this was the study that i ran with ellen languor wa back a when i was an undergrad actually we started at this study ellen langars a professor of psychology at harvard and she is done a lot of really fascinating work on her flavor of mindfulness which is distinct from e more easterand om mine mean a budthists sort of mindfulness pased a work and she you do not she actually was the one who said to me originally you i was an athlete at the time i was a isoki player and i was training constantly and and one day on there forget it she said the benefit of exerciseis just a plucebo right and thi was all that is outright jus ellen's fre ellen's ellen's known for for saying very provocative but also very wise things and that statement really got me thinking about that we designed the study together and that was to look at how what you study if exercised the benefits of exercise were a plucebo how would yo even test that because what does it mean to give a plucevo exercise we sort of flipped it on its head and we found a group of people who were getting a lot of exercise but were not aware of it that they work right this we settled on a group of hotel housekeepers these were women working in hotels who were on their feet all day long pushing carts changing linens climbing stairs cleaning back throoms vacuming it was clear that they were getting above and beyond at least the surgeon general's requirements at that time or which were to accumulate thirty minutes of moderate physical activity per day but what was interesting was when we went in and surveyed them and asked them hey how much exercise do you think you are getting a third of them said zero i do not get any exerc and the average response was a three on a scale of zero to ten it is clear that even though these women were active they did not have that mind set right they had the mind sat that their work was just work hard maybe thankles work that led them to feel tired and and in pain at the end of the day but not that it was good for them that it was good exercise what we did was we took these women and we randomized them into two groups and we told half of them that their work was good exercise this in this case it was true factual information we oriented them to the surgeon general's guidelines we oriento them to the benefits that they should be receiving and then we had measured them previously on there a physiological metrics weight and body fat and blood pressure and we came back for weks later and we tested them again and what we found was at these women even though they had not changed anything in their behavior at least that was detectable to us they didn'nd work more rooms they didn' starta doing pullups or push ups and between wetin cotellrums as far as i'm concern they did not report any changes in their diet but they had benefits to their health they lost weight they decrease their sostolic blood pressure by about ten points on average and a they started feeling better about themselves the their bodies and in their work not surprisingly that is amazing how should we o tak conceptionalize that result in light of o all of our efforts to get more out of exercise right as a reallier you mention it from the milk shake study and our perceptions about netri andensity that it sillabe the the right message as ectiy a lil bt counter intuitive that u think ah this is very a low calery a neutrient sporse om then it is good for me in the context of losing weight for instance but turns out the opposite is true because as you as you told us the the body response differently when you think somethings neutr dense and can ashy suppress hunger more in in light of this result i if i were to say oca in o my current understanding of of the literature is that getting somewhere between a hundred and fifty in a hundred and eighty minut's per week of carty f ascular exercise is probably good idea for most people if i tell myself that it is notconce to good idea but at it is extremely effective and lowering my blood pressure and maintaining healthy weight et ceter et cetera according to these results it will have an an enhanced effect on those matrics as cateri definitely this is a really important point because what this reveals is that we have to be more thoughtful and how we go about motivating people to exercise or teaching people about the benefits our current approach ist just to basically tell people large here is what you need to get here is at nnean to get good for to get enough benefits to receive the r enough exercise receive the health benefits the problem with that approachis that most people are not meeting those benefits yet there are not meening those requirements yet and the risk with that is that well the intention with that is to motivate them cause public health officials thinkil if i just tell people you nen to get more exercises cause it is good for you they will do it we know now that that does not work that these mthese guidlines are not motivational they do not change our behaviour in what our work adds to that is that not only is it not motivational it all creates potentially a mind sat that makes people worse then they were without knowing about the guideline again it is tricky i'm not saying that mind tat is everything certainly exercises good for us and youe as is healthful for us it is one of the things we have the best dat on ofm not saying o exercises all plaseebo what i am saying is that we need to be more mindful about how do we motivate people to exercise but how do we help people to actually reap the benefits of the exercise they are already doing now a acobvy is art who is as a grad student my labyrin a number of interesting studies along this o these lines a one in which she looked at three nationally representative data sets a which had this interesting question in them which was how much exercise do you get relative to others doo get about the same a little more a lot more do get a little less or a lot last rate the obdy your listeners you could all answer this and then in these data sets what she did what she had cold from data that trac deth rates over the next twenty one years and a couple interesting things revealed themselves one was that the correlations between these perceptions of exercise relative to others and people's actual exercises measured through a echelerometer a data as well as more rigorous sort of what did you do to day can a data a those do not correlate much at all thelon ble people lie but only osyo they mis perceive and or who is to say it is misperceeving there is just everything's relative right if you are i used to do triathlons very seriously f you were to ask me now i feel i'm totally inactive fras i'm not doing anything near what i used to an and if that is mi fokis set feelic i'm not exercising much but if i think about compared to other people given what i know about nacna national representative statistics and i could feel all i'm getting a lot right you can see how these perceptions are disa decoupled from objective reality and what we have found in in these studies is that that one question mattered in some cases more than objective activity but in all cases controlling for objective activity in predicting death rates and in some in one of those samples it was a seventy one per cent higher risk of death rate a if people rated themselves as feeling they were getting less activity than others te ai do it is a gig deal and i again that studies cross sectional logitudinall it was not experimental am but combined yothese really sort of coal last to say hey this is important too riht let us figure out ways to be active and get people active but let us also not make people feel horrible about themselves when they are not getting enough and going back to the the hotel study again i mention i did that at a time when i was a iw's a division when i hocky player at the time we are training all the time and i i was an unhealthy mind said about that i never felt i was getting enough i would come off a two hour practise into a wait lifting session a nd then i would get on the elyptical for thirty minutes cause i thought i had to do that also te mades ter with me at the time could attest to that and that study was really helpful for me to realize that i needed to pay attention not just to what i was doing but also take care of my mind set about that and and and i think the essence is how to get people to feel their getting enough it is a sense of enoughness that really matters i can see the dilemma because you do not want people thinking that that exercise and its positive effects are potent that they can get away with a three minute a walky stand that they are they are good because most likely they are not but again you do not want to them to be back on their heels psychologically that they do not even do that or that they i'm never exceed that my by very much but it seems the message from the the milkshake study and what were talking about now in terms of exercise would be to really communicate to the general public that that food has a potency even healthy foods have a potency to give as energy to fuel are ut e mean system and entercran system et cetera and that exercise has it a remarkable potency and that that potency can be enhanced by believing in or understanding that potency exactly isis at an accurate way to state it total that is exactly right and that is where i really feel we need to push an what i i try to do in our researches and not just show o min that matters is not interesting that it is it is both matter both exercise and what you think about it matter both what you eat and how you think about what you eat matter and we really as individuals and a a society need to work on yet what is the right way to cultivate both behaviours and mind sets about those behaviours tuch serve us and in the food context this again that milkshick study really changed me on a personal level because i had and somebody who was constantly tryining trying to restrain myt eating rigt ie i wanted to maintain er who whose weight look fit and i fos whell i should dieit i should have low calorylo car loug this loug that but at what that was doing was putting me into this constant mind sat of restraint and what that study suggested was that that mind set was potentially counter acting any benefit or any objective effects of the restrain diet cause my brain was saying okay your restraining may be my body was responding to that wat the brain was also saying eat more food yes tay hungry cause you need ta survive and the answer is it oh well throw everything into the wind and just strainth indulgent milkshakes all they long the ant sir is e healthy pod sr theys done the latest sience and what we know to be true about new trance in our bodies response to them but try to do in a mind set of indulgence a mind set of satisfaction o mind set of enjoyment and that is really the treck and that is what i at least try to day and in my own wife i love that and as i get more involveding into public facing health communications i this comes up again and again how how should we conceptinalize our behaviour how should we think about all these options that are offered to us and i i'm excited that the i'm the potency of mind sets are coming through again and again i have a question about the sentimenf the the study has ever been done but a lot of these mind set offects or something that years ago i thought i did vias of e sleep because i was in graduate school n as a postock even as an undergraduate i had much work to do that i decided i would sleep when i was dead wh it is not a good idea ah from what we know however i found that i a couple nights of minimal sleep or even and all night or and i could do pretty well i venturalyt would catch up with me has there ever been a study exploring whether not the effects of sleep deprovation i'm can be impacted by these mind set effects because over the years i keep learning more an more about how much sleep i need and i've really emphasisesleep and i do feel much better when i'm getting it but as new parents no or i students know or athlys no reany one that lives in ormal life find sometimes that they do not get a good nights sleep would believing that we can tolerate that and push through it and function just finding that it is not in o kill us or give us alsimers em i culd that help must deal with it with a poor nights sleep or even too or chronic sleep deprovition certainly i would i would guess there is been one study of my knowledge that tested that i dragon and colleagues and they looked at they had people come in and they gave them sort of it was a sham sort of e g tests s asort of figure out thhow we know this was done an number years ago now we actually have othink no devices to test thus but there is was the sham tasta than they gave people fake feed back about the quality of their sleep and how had had been the night before and they also asked tha the im participants how they felt about their sleep and im essentially what they found was that the this sham feed back if they were told that they would got in let lower qualitie sleep led to deficites and an variety of cognit of tasks im and that was a sort of decoupled from their actual e o qualities of sleepilies that self reported that is one study that a testa this i think certainly i' man i would i would but a lot of money i have not run thice myself but that near mind sets can push around ar cognitive functioning physiological effects of sleep but once again it is it is not all or nothing riy there are real important benefits of sleep and how far we can push around that through our mind tat is an open question o that the result that you mention is reallin shink is a lot of people you see sleep trackers now their using rings or risbands and that my lot is work preclosely with a company in they supply tos daye on how well people are sleeping you get a score a people get the score back when they see that score they might think they on these results oh my sleep my recovery score my sleep sgo as poore r i i should not expect much from myself to day or i you make sense that my memory would be going for this reason and i'll probably lose a few friends for saying this btly l gain a few as well that is why i to just do a subjective a score for myself if i wake up in the morning i just deci do not gad did at sleep well or not i do not seeing a number i do not getting at a read out from a device that is me i know a lot of people it and they can be very useful but a go should seems to these belief effects are reaving in at all levels i'd loove fors to talk about stress because your lab has worked extensively on this and if y if you would could you tell us at some point about the study that youve done about informing people about the different effects of stress but also if thre's an opportunity some take aways about how we could each conceptionalize stress in ways that would make it a serve us better i suppose to horm us and our mental an physical performance great yes ihad come off the heels of doing isome research and exercise nd die it and finding these provocative and also counterintuitive ffacts of is with respect to how we should try to motivate people ran and and as i was thinking about this and this grouping of going from medicines is to saving us to behaviours to saving us and how those behaviours might be influence by mind sets the obvious next thing to think about was stress rigt lookal you wan to be healthier fix your diet fix your exercise and stress less and s i started doing some digging into the nature of stress and couple things were clear one was that the public health message was very clear right that stress was that ve unmitigated and harm harmful on our health our prodectivity or relationships our fertility our cognition you name it right the messages that were out there by an large oversimplified messages focust on the damaging consequences of stress but as if you actually dive deeper into the literature on stress and the origins of stress what you find is that the literature most litter chairs as not clear cut an fact there is a large amount of evidence to support the fact that the experience of stress meaning encountering anversity or challenge in one's gol related efforts a does not have to be nebilitating an in many cases the bodies response was design to enhance our ability tomanage at those moments right some researc showing that stress narrows or focuss increases our attention speeds up the rate at which were able the process information there was some research out there showing this phenomenon of a physiological touhening the process by which the release of catabolic ormons an the stress response recruit or active anabolichormons which help as build are muscles build are ou o nurans to help us grow and learn and there is a whole body of emerging research on a postramatic growth or this phenomenon in which even the experience of the most tramatic stress tres the most cronic and enduring stressers could lead not to destruction but in fact to the exact opposite to an enhanced sense of connection with our values connection to others sense of am joy and passion for living and i iv found that to be interesting and my work sense then has been not to try to argue that stresses enhancing and not debilitating but try to point out that the true nature of stress is a paradox the true nature of stress is manifold and complex and lots of things can happen but to question what is the role of our mind set about stress in shaping our response distress some work had already been done looking at your perception of the stresser rits a ou view a stresser a challenging exam or a helpagnosis as a challenge dress threat and that had shown pretty convincingly that when you view stressers more as a challenge less as a threat that your brain in bbody respons a more more adaptively what our question was was to take the sort of psychological construle one step higher and abstraction not just the stresser but the nature of stress right do you you ad at that corelevel do you ew stressess something that is bad is going to kill us and therefore should be avoided or do you view somea stresses a nactral and something that is going to enhance us and we set out to design a series of studies to test the extent to which these mind sets about stress mattered am we first this again was with a peter salive and challen acre originally we designed a measure to test people's mind sets about stress simple questions what extent you believe or agree our disagreed with statements stress anhancis my performance an prodictanna stress a a a heightens my vitality in growth things that and we found in a number of correlational studies at that a more enhancing stress minds set was linked to a better health outcomes a better well being in higher performance then we set out to see if we cou change people's mind sets and in our first test of this we decided to do by creating these multimedia films that show case research anecdotes facts about stress all true but oriented towards one mind set or the other it is you can imagine one set of film showed fasically the messages that were out there in the public health contexts the other showed hey stress as ou know stress has been link to these things but in fact the body stress response was designed to do this did could do that and we had a empowering images lebron james making the free throw in the final minute verses missing it inso all of these things are true possibilities but oriented to two different mind sets about stress either people saw avidio that these semasee my stress will diminish you crush you reduce you or o vidyo very similar stress will grow you bring out your best and maybe even take youg to heighten levels of performance that you have never experec before exactly exactly y examples in the sports we also had true leaders emerge in the moments of greatestress churchill and all those examples are out there for both the enhancing nature and the debilitating nature and our question was does orienting people to different mind sets change how they respind to stress this study was done in the wake of the two thousand eight financial crisis we worked with a ubies a company a financial servis a company that was undergoing pretty massive amounts of layoffs of these employs for stress about being laid off they were taking on more pressure it was just a tough time and we randomized them into three conditions and this was all pree work before getting at a traning on stress a but the three different conditions some watched no vidios some watched the stress will crushyou vidis and some watched the stress could enhance yof idios and what we found was that just it was a total of nine minutes of vidios over the course of the week led to changes in their mind sets about stress which led to changes in there a physiological symptoms associated with stress of people who watch the enhancing films had fewer backaches muscle tension in somnia racing heart and forth and they also reported a performing better at work compared to those who watch the debilitating vidios now interestingly we did not make any one worse with the debilitaking vitty it us which is good we had we had told that a the ire be we ddn't expect that because that message was already out there that is what they were already seeing that was not new to them i was more this enhancing perspective that turned out to be inspiring i love that study and at i know we both have a friends and and tises in special operations community through it just happens tance and and we can m may will get into thalow later but i a good friend from that community i always says there only three ways to go through life at any moment which is either back on your heels flat footed or forward satr of mass and i said woll well what is the key to forward center of mass and he said it stress is what places you and forward center of mass meaning leaning forward and into challenge and i know that you have actually looked at that community anit does really seem that is it minds at thit either they have going in or that they cultivate through the course of their training but this notion that stress is what puts us in forward motion i is true physiologically i do mean a drunnle and major roll is to place us into a moment of it were to abise us towards action that is why we tremble at it wich the body trying to initiate action but i sh this is bo y goet opportunty it was if there is anything interesting to extract from the study on on seal teems what what was it ye know i loved working with with the seals am at one of the interesting things we found at the we had we have studied this measured this mind set in several different populations and in every single one that we attested far the average had been on the debilitating side of the scale the onte same stress is best stress is batrate and you knowts look with measures of a growth in fixd mind set s about intelligence attempts people are in the middle but often times havin moure positive minds its about intelligence that was not the case with stract it is still not the case of trying to get the message out there exapt for this group of naby seals or they were actually a recruits people who were going through basic training in order to become navy seals and we found that they on average had a stressis enhancing minds at perhaps not surprisingly right if your going into devote your whole life to thing and navy seal you must have some inclination that stress is a source of strength a for you but what we found with them we measured this at the beginning of ther basic training of bud's training and then looked at how well they succeeded through that programs ays this as an exstranly rigr his program you not the time it was only ten or twenty per cent of i till is trainys and honers afryaltiiftd theas or wel that no mt no matter how hard a pressures on the community thange that the numbers are still aon average about fifteen peryso what we found was that our measure predicted that rate people who had even within that range had a more stresses enhancing mines that we are more likely it complete training become a seal they also had faster obstacal course times and they were rated by their peers more positivelway ah again let us break this down right this does not mean and the people get mean people get this wrong sometimes they think that i'm saying that a stresses en hancing minds it means you should stress riht well maybe seals do but that is not what we are saying right having astresses in hancing minds it does not mean the stresser is a good thing right it doesnt mean it is a good thing that you have to go into combat in its not pretty right it does not mean that getting dign a cancer diagnosis is a good thing or being an abject povertieis a good things are not good things but the experience of the stress associated with that the challenge the adversity that experience can lead to inhenhancing outcomes with respect to ah not just ark cognition but our health our performance an our well being that mind set right how does that work right well it works through a number of different pathways one is that it changes fundamentally what we are motivated to do if you just imagine were stressted about something may be a glable pannemic for wo visnas for instance am and you think that tress is bad then what is your motivation right your motivation is to well first you get worried about the stress right now not only you have the panemic your stresse about the stress of the panemic but second ins your reaction is typically to do one of two things it is either to freak out and do everything you can to make sure that this does not affect you egno negatively or to check out and say oh it is not to be dealn i can deal withtat i you are basically in denial people who have a stresses debilitating mindset we have shown this in our research ten to go to one of the other of those extremes they freak out or they check out why because of stresses bad you need to eithere get rid of it and deal with thattror it needs tenoestrict if you have a stresses enhancing mind set the motivation changes right then the motivation is how do i youtilize the stress to realize the enhancing outcomes what can we do here right to learn from this experience to make us stronger fitter have better scienceand treatments for the future deep in my relationships with others m improve my priorities and forth right the the motivation changes the affect around it changes it does not make it easy to deal with but what we have shown in our researchis that people who have a stresses in hancing minds it have more positive affect not necessarily less negative affect am and apotentially changes physiology we we have a few studies that show that a people who are em inspired to adopt more enhancing minds ets have more moderate cort is all response and the'v hiher levels of dte levels am in response distress more workings to be done on the physiology but i loveyour take i yi he acanisms through which that is possible yes and and am d ce of course as an annibolic hormonin both men and women a very interesting because i we had a guest on this podcast a ec is a is a pc scientist who runs that u f see a performance training institute is name is dunkan french and his graduate work at a ucon stores was very interesting was an exercise science and physiology what he showed was that a if you could spike the adrennal in response i think they did this through first time skydive or something that that a testostrone went up now this spits in the face of everythng that we are told about stress and testostrone levels right am and this has also been looked at in females with estrogen although of course there is estergen tesocer on both males and females but that is how they design the study turns out that at least in the short term that a very stressful event can raise annibolic cormones and i think that people forget at a mechanistic level that adrennolin is epinefron an epineferin is derived by chemically derived from them moleculedopeme if you look at the pathway in even sgoogalain go images you will see that epi adrennolin is is made from dopeming andopaming and these annibolic cormons have a very clot ther suve close cousins they work together in the patuitarian hypotholmis it make sense that a one could a leverage stress toward growth am and towards annibalism as upposed to cannibalism which is not sent cannibalism as an eating other people but canaabol atabolic processes as i guess the right way to refer to it but what is again remarkable to me is that all these brain structures that control dopeming up an effran testostron and estrogen they are all thought to be in the subconscious meaning below am ar our ability to flip a switch and turn them onor off and yet mind set seemed impact them i i all that to say that there is a clear mechanistic basis by which this could all work and and i on the one hand i'm surprised because they these are incredible results on the other and i'm not surprised because there is a physiological substraiht there that could the ca readily explain them yend i think i think figuring o exactly how it works us really we should do that we should d aaverina we have got common friends in both departments to we shl we should do it wy that but i did not to mention o know the way the way i think about mins oin again i think we may t study this i'm not anarcintis i i' looked at this pat this is something we coan do but the way i think about mind set is that it is minds that is our kind of a pordal between conscious and subconscious processes they operats a default setting of the mind grat if if sort of programmed in there you have stress equals bad that is gan at can that that is gan a be something may be coconscious rat but it does not have to be consciess right you knowt people do not have to know their mind that s about stress until they are asked it really it is that is been programmed in through our up bringing through public health's messages and through media and other things an it cannas sits there is an assumption in the brain and the brain is then figuring out how should it respond to the situation and if the assumption that defalt the programming is stresses bad that is got a through our subconscious trigger all the things that si gocan will i need to rave up the things that protect me verses reve up the things that help me grow and that is at least how i think about it and what is cool about it is that because it operates as a sort of portal that communicates with more subconscious physiological processies but can also be occesss through our consciousness right just talking about this ra for your listeners they are now invited to bring there stress minds thts up to the consciousness and say what is my stress minds at how to ail my thinking about stress can i reprogramme that can i start to think about it as more enhancing that takes a little bit of a cconscious work potentially but then once you do that it can beck an can operate an in the background influencing how your body response and you do not have to say o cam stress i better tell my in of olic hormones ra abot at ithe work that way no am but these minds tets can help with ha translational process i love the idea that mind sets ar at the interface between the consciousness of conscieus and dem ithere is there is a lot to unpack there but clearly is the case at that the minds titthese sorbact is you rist ex rit in and and as we taught bhat earlier they can limit what the number of things to focuss on because one thing that is really stress was trying a focuss on everything all the time im try to navigate the public health around it anything the public holth information round anything is can of overwhelming as you mention for stress you see a lot in the stress is will crush you in han you can also find evidence that stress will grow you how should a we the listeners think about stress ad what what is the most adaptive way to think about stress no and should we talk about our stress should we not talk about our stress is there a short list of of ways that we can cope with stress better you nor i may i should be careful withther word cope is there away and we can leverage stress to our advantage great yen that is an important porton nuants in your language whiches people of by enlarge come from a place of how do you manage stress how do you cope with it which implies how do you fight against it vet yo fight is ar in if youll yet os lor y fight against at or o jeck out e rit and yet the real challenges how do we leverage it how do we utilize it how do we work with it and yu i've a lot of thoughts on this the first and morst most important thing is to clarify our definition of stress i think people often a sociate the the stress mint negative stress mines at is insidious that now people define stress with its negative consequences the first step is to decouple that and to realie that stress is a neutro irit yet to be determined effect of experiencing or anticipating adversity in your gol related efforts let me unpack that a little more you can be in the midst of it or you could just be worried about something happening that is one aspect second is adversity our challenged of something that is working against ye but the third piece is critical and that is in your gol related efforts but that means is that we only stress about things we care about things that matter to us this is really important right because stress is linked with it is the other side of the coin of things we care about right and i think that is the first thing to realize perit that as humans we stress because we care and we do not stress about things we do not cre about the simplified example i to uses if johnny was failing school that would not stress you out unless johnnie was your son or youere jhnny or you really cared about the educating the johnnies of the world right it only become stressful to the extent that you care about it why are we trying to fighter run away or hide or merely cope with our stress or overcome it through our missoashes when the stress is connected to the things we care about then the question becomes o ke if that is true how can i better utilize or leverage or respond to the inevitable stresses that were going to experience i'm not saying go out and seek out more stress what i am saying is that your gun experienced stress of you of any cares or values or passions and most all of us to am and then what do you do and we have developed a three step approach to adopting a streses in hancing mine set and briefly it is the first step is to just acknowledged that your stress to own it see it abe mindful of it the second step is to welcome it i why would you welcommit you welcome it because inherently in that stress is something you care about you are using it as an opportunity to reconnect to what is it that i care about here and then the third step is to utilize the stress response to achieve the thing you care about not spend your time money effort enerto tring to gett rid of the stress does that make sans make an ansand i love it as some mo use laboratory studies the physiological effects of stress the the effects it impress me the most or for instance the narrowing a visual attention that then i'm drives a capacity to parste time or finally which then drives the capacity to process information fasterates it is almost lke a superpower i and yes it can feel uncomfortable often im but i love the idea that i'm acknowledging it i'm embracing it and then understanding its power and leveraging that power ii think is it what i much about that framework is that the stress response is very generic we unlike the relaxation response we do not actually have to train up the stress response anso we all come to get this is a as a freeby and then it selms to gets a question of what we hand up doing with that right in honso a father of stress set himself as a non specific response reconds that it it occurs thait is what you are doing with it it is hire your cailing it and yet we talked about before of what most people to is the stress about the stress wit is an over exascervates it or they check out from the stress which leads to depression an an adonia because by checking out from stress ere also checking out from the things we care about and substance abuse exact recally on a lempky who also a we ate the good fortune of having as a guest on this podcast talked a lot about h this that m much of substance of use it it tissyu runs the ediction clinic over on the medside of campas im it takes over people's lives because of this increase ability to to find a solution to the stress that then eventually becomes its own stresser in its own problem im well i i i love that that that minht set in framework lefeda i'm telse just a bit about what europe to write now and what is most exciding to you now if you i'm ar able er willing to talk about some of that the work that is on the way i saw brief mention of something on your a publications wepside of a of a paper about influencers online influencers and nutrition at that might not be the main thrust of what you are up to but if you are able to tell us about it sor of interesting given that aa lot of the communication an and around this podcast takes place through social media eni can of launched into this a landscape now where i a constantly mombarde with health information an im an influencers and a deetermitanyven known to conn you are wi w oi on e onady on one way or the other but om the what it what is the deal with influence ors of the duingsoman good fruit alt information orr the rof the ruining the landscape u and then do not do not trurn protect my feeling no is i kno know thits dress s is atually annasce yes well that work is part of a body of work that we have been to venturing into whichis to understand where do these mind sets come from at ni mention ort of public health entities as one sourcos say our mind sets about stress but i think that our mind sets our influence by four different sources a first is our upbringing how our parents talked about things when restressed or food or other things a second is culture and metia movies ahyou know pod casts na and now social media a third are is influential others what doctors say to us or close friends or peers and forth is your conscious choice we talke about that a little you do havf at we have as humans have the ability to be mindful of and to change our mind sets a but the social media and influence or stuff has been in part an attempt to understand where do our mind sets about things healthy foods come from and brad turnwald who as a former gradstudent my lab has done a series of really interesting studies on this showing that fyou rate the nutritional quality of the top grossing a movies in the last twenty years are you look at the insta graam accounts of all the most influential people on a instant gram what you and you analyze the nutrition content of what they are eating a what he is shown is that depending on the study seventyed and ninety per cent of those movies or influencers would fail the legal standards for a advertising in the uquet their putting out ther nutritian contents that are yu knon't may be not surprisingly but undeniably unhealthy and to me that is interesting and importanta shows that werk it where we getting this mind set that those unhealthy foods are pleasurable desirable what is madbe even more interesting than that is some of the work that he and others and our lab have done to show that the ways people are talking about the foods their eating really matter to generally what weve found is that when people talk about unhealthy foods they use a language that connotes of sents of excitement fun sexiness danger indulgente masically and ything good indt is b te ely coos cakes high sugar ar yat really on healfe is truly unhealthy iof foods or yet that is actually of the objective what health means it is challenging but yet high fat i sugar theng there is pretty good agreement now that excessive sugar yis not and highly process yo hin te cross su successors a thing there is general concess i'm sure some one if you can to come after any wone come after me else tand bethibut on the other hand when people are talking about if they do which healthy foods are not portrayed and media they are not portrayed by influenceers rarely ever and when they are ther're often talked about with language that conveys a sense of deprvation it is it is nutritious but it is it sort of boring it is blan it is rolty a hone ando at a posthiti tati inn and this is really important because you are doing all this work tryint and others are doing all this work trying to in form people about what actually is good for them and meanwhile there is as hurrcane of other fu of force that is telling people that seeping into our minds that sure those might be good for you but those foods are not fun or sexy are indulgin or desirable in any way shape perforand it eits also a pad advertising for fast foods and suggary beverages and otherthings it is not surprising that we have this minds tat that healthy foods are the less desirable thing to eat because of those cultural and social forces a what our work has just tried to do is to reveal that youn a cin tefying it as a way to say r let us mabe beal at more mindful about how we talk about healthy foods and could if you are movy produsir can you be a litle but more mindful to show case healthy and delicious foods and have the characters talk about him in ways that are more appealing there is a lot of a room for people who produce this content to have an impact nochus on what people do but what they think about the foods their eating it is really interesting i hadn am fought about until now but it makes sense that any food that is packagin can be sold is to be woven into a a film or am promoted by a celebrity influence or not a health influence or persay but a celebrity influence are because they will get pat right it is part of the the eake system that allows them and in common e feats back on sails to the company and a whereas a things that cannot be commoditized it is it is were difficult i its hard to am the whever makes oranges in sells oranges is no unlikely to promote oranges in it and a celebrity posts or in a moovy because oranges can be purchased for many many sources there is now identifiable source of of oranges as there is with a packaged food for instance yet but the interesting thing we found in those studies is that it was not driven by promoted content or branded content there is some of that certainly and yet all the promoted and branded con he content is usually for process high sugar foods but ninety per cent or more of these foods that they were showing were not promoted or branded and there is e a lot of flexibility and what these producers are influencers could show on their media although it goes both ways right it is not just the producers and the influencers responsibility a the public is reactin to this and and we showed to that a people respond more positively their more likes on posts about unhealthy foot's it is a it is a yet it is a sort of a distasteful and in neck i it is a distasteful culture around healthy eating and we really have a lot to di to change it ye what is dotlemean circuits through and through just at the sight of some exact a very calory dense extremely tasty food am we drives those opening circuits o and for an i realize that there are people out there you derive the same sort of wor sime wor bebbles of of pleasure from healthy foods and that is a wonderful thing if one can accomplish thats we just eed more of that is what it sounsl ye exact and that is what is really inspiring to me at least is that it is possible right amy people thin go vegetables are just inherently less tasty than ice cream and it is bu that is not necessarily true also it does not have to be a competition right i do not have to get my three year old to hate ice cream and order for it ar brockly there is a lot more i can be doing to help shape a more positive improach oriented indulgent mine set a round healthy nutritious vegetables in fruits and to other fod fraight in addition to having her ice cream right and that is totally find sell see a really interesting study when it is published reas let me know an al e ye it was actually released this weet o grant yi will be sure in youaminternal medicin gamain ternal ok am great journal i will deafintly am talk about it on socio media and and elsewhere os very intesting what else are you up to lady thit is i my favorite question to ask any side tist recalleagu by the way is what you most excited about lately am wat what wat whatd you a late thinking about and getting up early thinking about yes hands down the thing i most excet will i guess there is many things the thing that i most into right now were doing the most work in is you knowi started by getting inspired by placible effects an medicinnd i did a long stent and placibo or belief effects in behavioural health and now we are moving back into medicine a i'm really interested and looking at how we can work with active dru gs and treatments to make them better and make the experience of them better by and stilling different mine sects a one study we did along those lines we work twith a kids or undergoing treatment for food alargies alargis to peanuts for example this was with carrinado whose the head of the stamphord alrgy senter here she is a great treatment for food alargies basically kids take gradually increasing doses of the thing theyi're lergic to peanuts and over the course of six or seven months these kids become less reactive to peanuts nd the problem with that treatment is its really a difficult because ther having all sorts of negative symptoms an side effects these kids are getting if itchy mouths and upset stomach their puking and atscary because theire literally eating the thing that they have been told might killed m and what we did in the study was we attempted to improve the experience and outcomes of that by reframing a mind sets about the symptoms and the side effects as it was bheing conducted before the kids were told look these side effects are just an unfortunate by product of this treatment and you have to sort of endure them to get through it but what we found in our conversation with carri was that the reality of those side effects was not negative in fact they were a mechanistically linked to the body learning how to tolerate peanuts or the alurgen and what we did was we worked within a trial they were all getting the treatment but half of them were help to see this more positive mine sects that symptoms and side effects from this treatment we are a positive signal that the treatment was working and their bodies were getting stronger and what we found was that that mind set led to reductions and anxiety a few were symptoms when at the highest doses and most interestingly of all they had better outcome based on amunemarkers that were a sign of the alergic tolerants those who had this min set throughout had better outcomes to the treatment that is just one example i think my goal is really to move us beyond the plucibo verses drug mind sat verses behavior to get to a place where we can blend them together and maximise the benefit of these treatments we are doing a lot of studies that how can we improve treatment for cants are with different mine sects we have done some work recently with the coved nineteen vaxene am an symptoms inside effects that is what a'm rearely passionate about right now credible com can whih do we bot studies that wene out were ya on the way open than i wallso read and communicate with you and then about that sa you nows maybe you would come on in sir ram an dul in sir gamelive im tou an make sure that i i do not screw up the delivery and that a we can hear it direct from the person who ran the study i i find this is sue a side effectually interesting i do not take a lot of prescription drugs but recently i was prescribed a fou and the list of side effectis i it is incredible as goes on and on and on i realize some of that is legal protections ins hard for me to believe that their actually expecting anyone to read those because you need a no high powered microscope to read this print is truly fine print but i did realize it in reading over the side effects hat you you prime one primes themselves to experience tho side effects and now i just rip up the side effectsthing in or that esheme just throw it away i just take it as recommended do you think it works in the other direction to where if an effective medication is i suppose to have result a b or se and you are told again and again how effective it is for that treatment that it could amplify the effect another words os not i i it strictly aplacebo it is not no sebo as you describe before but that perhaps at a lower dose i i given medication could have a amplifie effact were it it at a appropriate dos if you will it could have a superphysiologica an has that ever been demonstrated oh to some degree i think where gets tricky is for a long time people thought the effects of placebos were expectancy be you expect to get a benefit and that benefit occurs there there is certainly some some truth to that but i think the mind sat approach is more powerful because it helps us understand the mechanisms rigt if if you just expect that your blood pressure will go down that what are the mechanisms through which that expectation would lead to your blood pressure going nown wit is hard to even understand that rat but if you have the mind sat that you are in good hands that this is being taken care of that this is not this illness is not going to kill you i that you are been treated well then you can start to unpack the mechanisms through which blood pressure could be relieve may be its anxiety reduction maybe it is changing tha the sut o anticipation of what there the prioritization of what the body needs to focuss on and i really think that the work of the future needs to be ungetting more sophisticated about what is the mind sat that were int stilling when we say something will worker will not work and how do we understand the mechanisms through which that changes physiology i to answer your question i think that that could be true but it depends on what actuall is the minds at your evoking and ow your apparent and to the other parents outher but also to kis and people who do not have kis what is the best way to learn and teach mind sese om man clearly a conversation this informs me and o many other people out there about mind sets and how we can adopt them but it also seems to me that if we have the opportunity to teach mind sese and really cultivate certain mind sese that the world wod be a much better place yes how does one go about that given that ther were kids and we are all been bombarded with conflicting information all the time how do we anchor to or min set yen you are getting at my other major passion rat now which is what we are calling in our lab meta mind set i'm working on this it cris evans and others and that is how do we consciously and deliberately change our mind sets and the first step is really simple and that is just to be aware that you have them that the world your beliefs are not sort of unmitigated reflection of reality as it objectively is they are filtered throuh our interpretations ar expectations are frame works and simplifications of that reality and as your work and an ear as well that all of most of what goes on in our brainis and interpretatin of reality mind tat are just that simplified cor assumptions about things and the first step is to realize that we have them the second step is is start to think about what the effects of those mind sets are on your life to sor tof play out the story rit can i have this mind set that stresses divilitating how is that making me feel what is that leading me to do is this mind set helpful or harmful the question is not is the minds set right or wrong cause you can find evidence for against it and yet we can fight about it till were exhausted the question is is it helpful or harmful and then you can go about seeking out ways to adopt a more useful mind sets am we have been doing a lot of work on how to actually do that how do you consciously change it sometimes it is really simpl i think in cases where we do not have a lot of prier experience the the kids with am olargies who are getting treatment they they did not have any other mind sets about sentense we just god the lexury of setting it right when it comes to healthy food i think we ave it is harder to change people's mind sets cause we ave a lot of baggage weighing us down am as a parent for me i gets my number when piece of advice is to lighten up trying to get your kids to do certain things and folkus more on helping them to adopt more adaptive mind sets in im by no means an expert at this but i'm etesting it with my ownl child ner reals ime that in reall con yetit is how to i how do i resist the urge to force my child to eat her dinner that she can have her deserve it rit concee that is the real urge s knowu need to do agity because that when you have start thinking about it in terms of mind that you realize oh that is just reenforcing to her that the desert is the exciting fun thing to have and this thing that i have to do must be horrible horrible that might my turn is forcing me to do it right it is letting go a little bit of the behaviour the objective reality and really thinking about the subjective reality and folcussing un adaptif mindsets not my goal as apparent has been o try to help her and still a healthy mind tet aabout eating that healthy foods are indulgent and delicious that the experience of stress is inevitable that it is it it is natural and that it can help going through stressful experience can help her learn grow and become a more connected and happier individual and with exercise and physical activity we have not really got into that yet but tu we will et sie now it is great ip i wrote down and i'm going to keep this in the front of my mind going forward im to continually ask what is the effect of my mind set about ex just to valuate that about excise about food about school about stress about relationships about relationship to self et cetera and to really i'm think about that in a series of layors you think that would be a useful exercise definitely an and an your work speaks o te sten in the mindful it is not i would you have really urge against people getting dogmatic about their minds set also right li go i need to have the right mind satter and if i do not have the rim enough psichlook it mind it is a piece of the puzzle it is a piece f the puzzle that is a really empowering because we have access to it and we can' change it but it is just one piece of a puzzle treat yourself a sciencess look at your life look at your minsets see whats serving you see what is it find more useful adaptive and empowering min sets and and live by those lof it no in one version of this kind of discussion i would have aske the questionman aske next at the beginning i'm going to ask it a now close to the end which is your unique constellation of om accomplishments and an attributes and i only know a somset of them of course exidates the first time that we have m imperson even tho i've known your work for a long time and colleagues across campus you you run your laboratory o we do a research you were also it atly in university a serious aftly and the yo uare also a clinical psycholojust is that right si was trained as a clenical psycholices my pagetys and clenical psychology and i did all my a pre and post intern sheps at them with stress and troma do you see patience were did you see pation i yend yes i do not any more o that is a very unique constellation of practitioner and research or to what what are the mind sets that you try and adopt a on a regular basis in as a consequends ore in relation to those things or athlete research er clenition for yourself as you move through life you have in overarching mind sat that all challenge s good am or do you have any kind of a censral mind sets that help you a navigate through iu was it has to be a pretty complex et of of daily routines given everything that you juggle what i think that people you are arunique an in that you have that you have the inside knowledge of of how thi stuff works and you have also existed in these different domains i know lot of listeners have a more athletic m a slant to their life for a more a cognev or someer raising kis or some people are just ou nont it are doing any number of things si this where i think it would be useful for people to heare can what woat do you do s in om asking yet well it is certainly cur in my case that researches me search everything that i study as an intellectual has come from my own experience are my own failing trainin when i was really intensely exercising and training those were the questions i asked when i was dealing with teating and concerns about my weight those were the questions i asked when i was stressed about my dissertation i decided to do my dissertation on stress no now think or in the midst of a glovel pandemic it is what how can our mind sets be useful here i know i do not think there is a obvious answer to your question other than the guiding light for me has been an under current of understanding that our mind sucs matter i think i got that very clearly and deeply as a child both through my experiences as an athlete i know many of your listeners or athletes any athlete knows that you can be the same physical being from one day to the naxt one moment to the next and perform completely differently just depending on what you are thinking i was a gimnest growing up and if you cannot visualize if you cannot see something in your mind that you have no chance when you get up there on the balance pame write and i also my father was a marcial artis a teacher of meditation this kind of mind body work was baked into me from an early age and i think what i've done recently is to try to understand it scientificallete and mo r importantly to figure out how can we how can we do better with this rat how can we were all talking about eh i taking over the world and tachnology this and all h personalize medicine that and it is we have done little relatively little with the human resource or human brains that the the the potential for which is great and we have done almost nothing you kdo not take the placeple effect we know a lot about what it is we have done almost nothing to e leverage that in medicine consciously and deliberately my an what keeps me going what gets me through the hard times is just that burning question of what is going on here and what more can i do with the power of my mind well i am millions of other people are grateful that you do this work it is important and it is truly unique tell us where people can learn more about your search where they can find you on line i'm gin a trying persuade you to take more aot a social media presence of going forward but whether not a i succeed in that effort or not a where can people find you i asked questions find your papers learn more i'm i love to have you back for a conversation the future but in the mean time ye i know it is really a spend such an honour getting to chat with you i just you you have such an impact on the world than i look for it i hope we can dive some science together i ta absolutelyyet wa all our papers and a materials and interventions our house on our web sight a em beeld ot standfort tot e dy you i we allso have a link there to that takes you to standford spark which stands for social psychological answers to real world questions we lot of tool kits on that web sight a including a tool ket for this trethink stress approach of acknowledging welcoming and utilizing your stress and then im i guess im on twitter oly a cri do not do much there but maybe i will start to wet those are all great resources we will provide links to all of those for our listeners an viewers and e'lso hope in to convince you to write a book or many books in the future i the world needs to know about this but thank you much for taking time out of your exceedingly busy scatual to talk to us about these ideas i learne much i'm going to devilly think about what is the effect of my minds et about blank ind an every category of life and and really

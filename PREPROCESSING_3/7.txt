well youve ferd the words diversity equity and inclusion over and over and over d e i a hurit from the white house you hureite from your corporation you hure it from the media and this standard diversity equity and inclusion according to jobion's white house has been infuse in every aspect of american government now what exactly does any of that mean we talked about it at length on the show before diversity equity and inclusion is essentially critical race theory boiled down to a friendlier piece of corporate boiler plate essentially wood argues is that if you have a situation in which one demographic group is underrepresented in any particular industry or job that must b the result of some sort of systhemic discrimination or racism for example if you do not have enough say black surgeons that is because the surgical system itself discriminates against black people because in the sor of vision of ibram excendy either every one is equal in every possible way which means that therefore everyoneshuld be equally represented in every industry or every one is unequal which means that you are racis now there is a a sort of half wayed point between those two positions which happens to be the truth that people of all races and all individuality differ in their genetics they differ in their environments they differ in their culture that all individuals are different in that means tht when you take a look at group baverageis there are very few examples actually a cross all of humanity in which group averages are completely identical but we have to ignore that in favor of this d e iproposition why because d e i is a is a gun pointed directly at the heart of the marytocracy the marytocracy suggests that there should be objective metrics by which we succeed or fail and the good newsabout marytocracy is that it means that if you succeed it is because you are doing something better than someone else which means that is better for every one else the d e i idea innately means that people wh are unqualified are going to advance in life by dints of the fact that they are considered a part of the victimized to group now why does this matter in matters in prty much every industry matters tat universities where you'v seen for example agian americans discriminated against because they are too high achieving in favor af people from other groups who have lower tescores you have seen it in the government receive pople completely unqualified for particular offices appointed two those offices as to establish someform of social justice and now we see it in medicine one of our producers excellent research from producer gregray he helps us put this together and it is in amazing amazing story d i is not just present when it comes to your corporate hiring practices it is also present in medicine and that should fright on living hell out of everyone because all you careabout when you goin to the docries is my doctor good at the medicining is my doctor good at taking care of me and making sure that i am healthy and in this is an arya where marytocracy should be the only thing that counts is my doctor likely to fix me or is my doctor bad at that job and got appointed because of extraneous merits and when matter what those extrameous merits are whether they are intersectional or whether it is napit that does not matter all you care about when you get into that surgical bed is that the persan operating on you should be good at that job but surgery is now being impacted by d e eye apparently sorce is at wake forse mdical school are about to gratuate cishell dill rosario she is a med student who injured a concermative patient and then bragged about it here is what she tweated his a back in march of twenty twenty two quote i had a patient i was doing a blood drawon see my pronoun pin and laugh loudly to the staff she her well of course it is what other pronouns are even are there it i miss tis vain ho had to get stuck twice snorting laughing emogi now that of course is in insain twe the idea being that if somebody disagrees if you politically then you make them actually suffer because you are in the position of the doctor now as

medical error upon you because you have the wrong belief system say you believe in the actual scientific fact to there are men and there are women that is a serious serious problem also according to our sources both you pen and lose medical schoolway forust if attempted to hide loose hiring whe forse didnectiold list lose hospital and graduation materials pens is not list lose medical school on its web side now again all this is just the tip of the iceber and this one basic situation which no apology was issued for a bad tweat you could theoretically imagine a situation in which these students they said something dumb but now they apologize for it because they realize thatit was wrong to say it but that is not actually what happene and the bigger problem of course is that this sort of perspective which that left wing social views or introsectonal quolities make you a better doctor this is become a widespread perspective in the field of surgery let us talk about in wardwining due surgicaoressent in vignash raman an internal d ilectur raman actually said that ius hart sinks when he have patients w watch fox news or where magahats here is what he had to say you knon thing as we in the thou right and unlike a lot of the elect hospitals in the nothes on the wes we sar a very southern population this is not of i p hospital a people are not flying in from cata to get treated her we treat patients wa jus from the community in the south and yes my hot tings everytime i going to a room and i watch them watching foxus are they have amaga hat on are they are wearing a confederate bet and i these are the patients ot retreat but dorda i a wolt sayo the one very good thing abo ther thought that injon is exactly what a leded to alia is that we do not treat the ipes we treat people from our community and all community is as alw explain is majority non white and it is wonderful to treat such a dives group of people in every regod and that is not an experience that i had an my savis another placeas a aught that my friends have training another progresss fors wall diverse meaning non white is an amazingly euphamistic statementdivers usually means i brought diversity of people but now of course diversity means not white people first of all when you have surgical resident it one words talking about their hearts sinking when they see somebody of a different political perspective that should put up your rade are a little bit but that is not the bad part the bad part is what raman says next according to raman he says the post george floid duke actually made a conserted efforts to stop hiring many concal walls of white men and that the team even learned to abandin particular metrics ands op polistic application practices as to accroup more women and more latin act surgeons here is vignash raman twenty twenty en doflie tos even haen and go collectivly yagenas the conyees of ducuetea tetey ae amen to try to dotho te and recognize then is sentiuris long hisso rasism and flavory in which dupunivesity esentially was fonded on which of a fonded and that is when we thought of ad to confront that the histy of institution they sf ou departmen the that them that the wa the white men that a draked across o a always aand and and that is when we wesatitis stoe think that may be something should change something terchange within ours o and in and who comprises this department thend of the faculty instend of residen significant inequity in representation in our programm and and something that wein consciously deliberately working had to change of the last several yeas im some of things that we that we have done in addition to what lilin presented i think the most important thing we weve don is really systemac changes to our recruitement process to try to precruit divers residence to ur programm and then to retain in sepolttes i es residence off to the get to our programe part of this has in bal trontes thing to completethe holistic review process that we spoke about ot to day im apondiding in all to metriks anc creens im looking at peoples blife story in in what pro them into sury im and then the othepart ofit is in eting that i bist people read the opplications and because that is an important component oftinsuring that we get thattis residence into our programm and then once residence get here i how do we howtre support them sojust to get that strait he is literally saying that we are ignoring metrics in order to look at the life story of your surgeon now just have a question for you go in for an open hard surgery has god from medgot a blockage in your arnery do you ask for the surgeon's life story do you care about the surgeons life story should you care about the surgeons life story or do you care a lot more about whether this doctor has a good trac record of making sure the people who require a bye pass actually get the by past they need without dying on the table it is insane for surgical residencies do take a look at people base on their whife story as opposed to objectic mactric of success it is totally crazy it is totally what by the way this same person has also tweated that he will not quot quote amplify medical literature involving only white men he tweated out is july of twenty twenty quote i would say even for academice publications i do not want to amplify the work of white men who only collaborate with other white men we hate o most of the modern medical advances in human history in e suriously you you youare not going to actually take a book at the academic publications of white man working with other white men le first of all thits racism second of all these are the areas where merit matters most and of course again even the skuy is only one example of a big or tren disguise the tip of the iceberg the american college of surgeons the ace yes gave its eightieight thousand members for example a definition of racism that says it is literally impossible deraces against white people here is what they said quote racm racism is the marginalization and ore oppression of people of color thase on a socially constructed racial hierarchy that privileges white people racism involves one group having the power to carry out systematic discrimination through the institutional policies and practices of society and by shaping the cultural beliefs and values that support those races policies and practices that is the ipram excendy definition of racism racism is not just discrimination against a race it is power plus discrimination against the race and the only people we can ever deem to be powerful are white men which means that being racist against o white people is totally vine not only is at find it is a corrective mechanism barring for example white men from getting into top level surgical residences as a corrective mechanism is somehow good now and you put that pressure all the way down system and what you are ending up with is feu are qualified people who are entering the system and more unqualified people going to top medical schools it is more onthis in just one moment first can you believe saned patricksdas almost here recently a lot o

wichanting phenomeenalis tey hav on to fello grand in a word specifically for under persented minurities again these sorts of happy talking nonsensical phraseologies all the stuff is one thing in thes sunorgistic corporat board room it is another thing when you are talking about the sorducal roo here is a reson conferente ont i at pen where you and wuna work one surgeon explain that wase off putting that many surgeonts were quoncal white men it is i think surgean general has been a predominently white an ma dominated feld and that can be very am of cutting and intimidate angor somebody a and i unfortion i think they probably lost many gridat minds just for that readen the do not fee i they the lan they feel there another and i think you do not lec tur hear it it you can very easily feel another just because ye do not look ther shar alot of the same experences as your peers yyou know it make somebody feel another if you literally say that they are in oppressor class and therefore should not be part of your surgical residency these seame doctor is go on to explain the surger require something the anifells runy rules the runy rule is a ruin the anifell tha you must interview a certain number of black c applicants to a position tbefore you are actually allowed to hire their saying the teams should be forced intervieu migh norty candidates regardles of qualifications i published years ago that the runy rule the rule they us that had a fells should be applie to i can ave it bot a tat a i can av surger in parsiculaar am if you thoughtsome of the comments must recivly about the i efforts were ar cholengin it an inflamen tora now you can imagine a decat a go that means that is still needed to be discussed i think the lands of who else is out there let us reach a little further not down but ot am pertain to cantinance that we need to consider it is poblar the way that that they needs to go samford my beon i thee there also needs to be some a a countability or some am you do not credents put on diversity inisiatives put on thet diversity work that you mar may not be doing her the diversity of your department for the diversity of something because certainly if you publishd seventy five manuscripts in an abreviated mount of time absolutely but the runy rule which we know does not work very well since there is not that many black a had coaches is also that they they ust have to interview them they do not have a hirer wooman they nohae to actually think of bout then you don' on the same level they have to interview them it' i think that still were still in the same issue that if the white man or or tha the white mail chair is picking their successor or picking whoever it is there is still been a gravity towards the white mail whatever and the ruly i thing is great that it needs to go once that further and and i'm sure at that lecnati creditly arr out in the world but what it is true if whe know just interviewin aitan enough co this done i aint it people must be forced to select force to select black candidates or minority candidates or whomever force to pick tat i love the fact that we are now living this orwellian world where she can assume that if a white chair of a medical association picks say in asian persons tor a place them that that is in a fact white supremacy done through unconscious bice but if they openly pick somebody for race then that is somehow a corrective another would you have to assume that the entire system is evil in order for you to purpet perpetuate your own evil which is to select people not on the basis of merit that you literally says that it is one thing if you have seventy five publication or wat ever but what about peopl who do not have seventy five poup what about the people who are just in competent why should not they have a shot that being chief medical resident at harvard why not what what would exactly is te problem whell i mean listen here is the problem the problem is that the thord leading cause of death in the united states is medical error that is the thord leading cause of death they are enough mistakes that get made in the operating room or in doctor's offices all around the contry already the last thing that you need is to specifically go out of your way to put unqualified people in positions of power based on their race and whenever people say the sort of stuff there is an accusation what your saying is races kno what i am saying is the opposite of races i am saying merit should decide merithoudecide the people who are advocating for d e i in these professions they are the races theyare explicitly saying that race is the only relivant factor that you beaple to overcome merit yand this is dangerous stuff because people die all the time and hospitals people die all the time from medical mal practice from medical error and going out of your way is a medical school or is a college of surgents to suggest that d e i ought to be governing principle there ought to be only one governing principle and one governing principle alone and that governing principle ought to be the merit of the doctor that is it there is no other governing principle as a patient tht is what i care about when i put my kids in the care of a doctor or a surgeon god forbid the only thing i care about is whether that person is going to be able to take care of me or my kid i do not care at all about the race of the person and the fact nat that color blindnees is now seen as racism and of the corrective to that is actual racism is totally insan is can get people kill it legitimately will get people killedyoull then competent people in positions of power specifically because of d e eye and that particular philosophy is not of course relegated to te practice of medicine it is more on this in just one moment first tot i tell you black riful coffee may be keeping me alive and and moving at this plant makit to rik me up at all hours of the night and

nursing student at the university of georgia campus in afins the young woman's name was laken hope rily who 's a junior on the deanslest at augusta university according to the university of georgia policechieve jeff clark it was a crime of opportunity by an individual who woke up with bad intentions to who exactly is the alledged murderer whele the police or recomending charges against a twenty six year old including felling murder false imprissman kinnapping and concealing the death of another in rile's killing to exactly was the suspect whele turns out that the suspect was wait for it inyly lemigrans this person is undocumented apparently according to a member of the georgia legislature the suspect was in the country illegally having crosse the border in ou pasotecas intwo thausin twenty two hofs apprehendhed at the border and released into the united states now again that is the cattionrelese programmes tdebie administration as put in places all bout t ea remember diverse people get to break the law that is the way that tis works the suspect was arrested in queens new york for an injury to a child and having no licens that was in september of twenty twenty three but gain new york city also has a d ipolicy whereby they have decided that crime in objective metric is no longer sufficient to decide whether some one ought to go to jail or be deported if two many black or hispannic people are being arrested and or teported well that must mean that the system is broken and we hve to get rid of the metric itself the suspect and his brother recited in afins clark county in october of twenty twenty three for shoplifting the suspect even had n ow standing bench warrants as of december twenty twenty three for failing to appear in court on the choplifting charges the suspects brother was charged yesterday by federal authorities for possessing a froshlant green card the suspect brother was arrested in afins clark countee in september twenty twenty three fr a du i driving without a licence speeding open container and failure to lea yield to an emergency vehicle and was arrested again in december jobyden has taken up d yiat every level of his administration that means with regard to emigration policy as well in people are dead because of it that is not to say that the vast majority of people whore crossing the border ar criminals other than the illegal crossing of the border it is to say that when you let people in and you do not let them and you ove no idea why theyre here and then you arrest them multiple times and release them without the porting them people lie they should be very obvious stuff ice put out a statement as well they say that the twenty six year old citizen of venisuayle was arrested by c b piece softember eight twenty twenty two after unlawfully endtering the united states near a posso taxis he is paroled and release for further processy on september fourteenth twenty twenty three he is rrested by the an why pety and charge he was released by the unwiputy before any detainer could be issued and then on febrary twenty twenty third twenty twenty four earro atlanta encountered this person pursuing to his arrest by the university of george police department and being charged with murder and other crimes and finally earo atlanta lodged a detainer a this is the pure and obvious outcome ofv a hurrific emigration policy undertakcun by this ad ministration none of this had to happen y uhow we known it did not haveto happen this jobidon is now considering taking executive actions who stop it from happening jobid now ants to change the definition of asylum at the border as to reject people at the border rather than processing them and letting them into the country for non specified at period of time tammy duckworth very liberal senator she says that yhou'd back jobitns executive actions to stop asylum clams which by the way is in an of itself a tacit admission to all the charges republicans have been making about bad democratic emigration policy the bi administrations considering using exact tat of action to make it harder for migrante to claim asylum would you support that i would support that because we do have a crisis at the porter but i also think tht something dona trunk tried well what dotto trump has has packed away from this as part of that package there was more money for a whole bints of thinks to include a were aa a worker programs o that people could actually go to work at while they are waiting for their case to be atudicated i think that is quickly important is a work parmet for folks who come here if they want to work witl as put them to work i've got the act in destreets looking for workers retails of for workers while they are waiting for thei let us let allow hem to work ther an that compromise it is exactly that there was stuff the fix the of the border problems but also allowed us to let to be humane about how we take care of the micrants er here again een democrats are now realizing hon f political liability this is and they should president trumk was on the attack about this over the weekand he was speaking at seapack and he had talked about jorbidnsemigration policy and it is it is funny to watch democrats to cry trump for saying what is obviously through here we have a new cato goin mygrin crime and it is going to be more severe then violent crime and crime as we know it because we have millions and milions of people and they came from prisons an jails they came from mentalinstitutions andsan the sylums know the not the same say and in saneso em is ta mental institution on steritsit is a silence of the lamps he ca the hadabolector they are all being deposited into our country and then you have ters and then you have tras and then you have yuman trafficers and the coming over it levels never seen before we never seen anything this the people who are getting ourage about trum sayng suf that it seems to me shuld be a lot more outrage about the fact that illegal imigrants sometimes kill american citicen and they should not be here that is what is truly outrageous i tell about preborn a lot on this show that is because i believe in their mission reborns network of clinics is saving as many babies as possible from the clutches of abortion their clinics are located in the darkest corners of the nation where the majority of abortions are taking place preborn offers these expecting mothers free ultrasounds they believe when a mom heres for babies hardbeat on the ultrasound she usually chooses life and that is true it is an amazing trans foremen of experience to use ultrasound ive forkas met all of them long before they were born veaals forsound and now preborn is helping expectant moms do the same they rescue two hundred babies every day but by the time this message is done two more babies will have lost their lives abortiontins on can stop we ned every one to say enough and help fight save these unborn children if you have the means would you consider a leadership gef to save babies in a big way attack seductable donation of five grandwill sponse or preborns in tirenutwork for s twenty four hours helping to rescue two hundred babies to do not aget securely tow pounds to fifty say keeword baby that is town two fives ero say ke were baby or go to preborn dot com at slash ben agan that is preborn dot com at slashben and this is what trump is banking on for his realact is that bottom line is jobidon has ben a terrible president and people of paid the price because jobidon is a terrible terrible president at see pack presen and trumplas sayng that jobine is directing the country tord collapse and certainly when you look at the fact that at least a seven point two million people wern counts ard at the border under jobidon millions more not encountered anywore bteen seven and ten million people of probably enstered the contry legally since jobidon took office i mean those are awful numbers and trump is right to pointed out oviously if crooked jo bidon an is tugs when and twenty twenty for the worst is yet to come a country will go an sink to levels at we are unimaginable and just think about it with for more years of bidin the hords of a legolelion stampating a cresobord is will exce forty jot fifty million people metic care social security health care and public education will bocko and collapse it will collapse as sures your sitting or standing there it will collapse ar economy will be starved of energy by crookedgos indictive gren new scam it is a greene scampit will be the destruction of our country it is indeed a scam and most of them know it some of them the fruels believe it but most of them no oet yay presideend trump the the media re trying to convince you thatyou should be scared of president froms policy proposals that is we should be scariffs the takn to tacts with regard to trump one is crazy orange man bad and the other is his policies are scary and terrible the problem is that jobidon's crnt policies are bad that trumps pledges to reverse those policies ar incredibly sane by comparison men trumt politico is threatening us for the god times to politicalisan entirepiece tetl beyond shock and awe inside trums petential second term acenda from nation white abortion bands wo class from culture wards assaults on climatetines and political leponization of the military his return to the whitehouse co make trumpone point o seemed tamp what a ma cekel frank about something trump omp ont o was tame it was extremely ta trump one point ot in terms of policy was sane and tame which is why as of twenty nineteene before the covit bandamic we had a booming economy peace on the foreign front and a fairly high level of domestic tranquillity i noticed all of that why because it was pretty sane if your threatening me with more sanity i do not ov that is much f a threat according to politico trying to scare the hell out of you both supporters in critics of the ex presient predict a reelected trump would wage a more focust than aggressive attack on the status quot andman i can only hope this time that he they say he would be far more knowledgable about the mechanics of wielding executive power having placed many conservatives in federal judgeships hofd face less resistance from the court and he would be more determine to place loyalists not rules obsessed traditionalists insenior roles went my guess is that he woud actually be more i he would be more interested in making sure that people were lower down on the food chane were people who were not to tempting to u no destroy his presidency from within what exactly is scary apparently he is talking now about a sixteen week abortion bad that is something that he is pushing a sixty that by the way is way later than virtually every country in europe that is supposed to scare people he apparently also wants to go after federal climate science and in sure t cannot be used to guide government policies which let us be clear about this it should not be guiding executive policy if the legislature wants to make decisions to cripple the american economy bast on the gradual warming of the climate over the next one hundred years using measures that will not markedly decrease that warming and our heavily reliant on forn countries to do the same when what the legislature do that let your let your legislators be punished for it why should the executive branch be responsible for doing all of that trump also is going to target china heis going to but teriff's on china he said economic security is national security china is not allow american companies to take over the critical infostructure america sh not allowd china to take over our critical in for structure he said he would impose a for your plan to facs out all chines imports of a sentural goods everything from electronics to steal to farmasuticles mean again show me the law where is the problem of that do you want to be reliance on chinese farmasuticles what happens when china invades ti one what happened when the ability of amer rickins to get vital goods goes away because we did not prepare for the possibility of that politicoes also trying to scarry tht he is gin a wageor classromore a and this is on of the left favorite games is that they declare war on something perfectly inocuous a classroom by trying to sectualized children and then when you say no youre waging ou classroum war and this is all the stuff that supposed to be scaring you i gottell yo i do not seem scared about all of it w do not seem superscared about it also apparently they are saying that donal trums gem deploy you us troops against americans ot well kno actually what he said is that if there is a roguds he might call the national guard which is pretty sayng to me and as far as the notion the is going to a bandin nado that is not true what he says is that the members of nato need to pay their fair share he does not mean that the united states is going to stop being a member of nato and by the way it is worked the members of natol are upping there own defens spending and e's ging to loosen the rains on cripto god for bed oh no we have to make fur the goverment canstint this is what th the democrats our trying to scare you with that is hungin a work there can have to resort to prong number one again which is donald trump crazy person now this is not mean that trump has a a clear paf ahead for the presidency ere's a primary over the weekend in south carolina we gn to get to that in just one secon because it shows you handa the stratagis that are being at tempted by both sides democrats and re publicans it is really focust on what we would call the low propensity voter

has the advantage in the selection and that is not really because of trump much as it is about yobide right now in the real clopolitics pulling average donal trump is running fully one point nine points ahead of jobidon at this point in the last selection cycel tobidon was running nearly five points ahead of donald trumpet of course he only narrowly beat him in the electoral college according to the bran new heris exp ole that is out over the course of the last few days trumpe is up for corint econimoust you gup trumps up one acoring to morning consult trump is up for if trump is up in the popular vote trum swinting the election if trumps even within a point in h popular vote trump is going towin the election trump is in prety goo shape but he does have a problem the problem that he has is can he get low propensity voters to the poles because the republican party has tradead high propensity voters for low propensity voters that is one of the things that is happen now democrats of sort of dum in the same it is really weird both parties have decided that the median voter the high propensity median voter is no longer a person worth per suing if you look at the rate to voter turn out it is not just can you get a certain per centage of a populary a population base to vote in your favor are what percentage of whites or black aoletinos went you favor it is how often those groups vote are they high propensit voters or are they low propensity voters and what you see is that in the united states there are wide disparities between different groups based on age based on rage based on education based on family in come in who is a voter and who is a non voter huge disparities if you take a lok for example at twenty twenty two write the last election cycle what you will see is that among voters the number of of eighteen to twenty nines was really really low twenty seven percent of eighteen to twenty nines did not vote in the twenty twenty to election only ten per cent did the same thing was true of thirty to forty ninurolds thirty ceven per cent of thirty to forty ninerolds did not vote they represented thirty seven percent of the non voters rather they are representanly twenty six per cent of voters the over reprersenting groups in terms of people who vote for s people do not vote are people age sixty five pluss people ore age sixty five plus definitly benifit trump sos are higher propensity voters however they are other cross cutting considerations for example voters in twenty twensy two whites are overrepesented in terms of being high propensity voters seventy five per cent seventy five per cent of voters in twenty twenty two were white compared with fifty five per cent of non voters nine persent ore black nine per cent ore hasbenic three per cent reation hispannic are wildly under represented there i very low propensity group if you are republican youre hat youre conting on heavy letzeno turn out to jogued victory or foir democrat doing the same those that that is a low propenity voting group black americans typically are a are a low propensity voting group when it comes to education however iu thak look at at to whites overrepresented old people overrepresented but when it comes to education who are those people they ten to be college graduates if you are a high school or less voter that be a lot of trum white voters are high schole less very low propensity voters only twenty five percent of voters and twenty twenty two had a high school degree or less in terms of education compared to forty three per cent of the people who did not vote if you have some college then you are petty much equally likely to vote not vote if you are a college grat or a post grad your significantly more likely d vote this is why for example democrats are vote ore focussing in on the views of their college educated white ladies in the suburbs those are very high propensity voters but they are then accompanying that with low propensity voters black in his panic voters in major urban areas for example at's a weird coalition meanwhile republicans have also bear built a weird coalition there weird coalition is high propensity voters namely old white people but also very low propensity voters namely high school educated poor white people ore also less likely to vote save a coalition in both parties of some high propensity voters in a lot of low propensity votes the question is how do you get your low propensity voters to vote that is the real question becaus neither party can afford to lose a lot here i if you are donald trump had do get those low propenity voters out to the poles well donald trump actually does have a habit of getting low propensity high school educated white mals for example out to vote in broader numbers can jo bidn do the same with minorities it is the reason right now why he is trying to capitulate the commoss it is the reason why he is plain footsee with the with the radicals in michigan it is the reason why he refuses to take measures that would crack down any legal imigration up till now he is trying to to please a low propensity voting group young people very low propensity voting group he is trying to please those people anlow propensity votin groups black americans he things that if he caters to that voting group they will show up in broughtena low propensity means likelyhood d vote ritypically the way that you win in election if you want one election yet everybody who is sixty per cent or up in terms of voting for you to get to the poles and then you can vince everybody whos forty per cent or up on voting for you gets the polse those who be independent very often people who votalot but you are not shure wich for ther in vote nobody is aiming at the median voter any more it is pretty im pressive how everyone is steadfastly ignoring the median voter which is for example why nickey haley pulls really well in general election terms because she is contintermns f hor positioning she ectiul closer to con the median voter now does that mean that yhou'd ever win a primary inside the r publican part the answer of course is now which is what happen in south carolina the other days whon south carolina donald trump blue nickey haley away he want a twenty point victory over nickey haley in south carolina's frepublican primary that of course is where she was a the governor that was her home state americans for prosperity action told that staff sunday you would stop supporting her financialliyst this race is effactively over for her shoe does't have the money to keep running she says she is going a continue to stay in i assume the reason that she is staying in is because she believes that if she stays in and if donld trump gets the nomination that he loses she is gone be able to stayless and i offered you an alternative try me give me a shot next time around co shoviouslytingon win the nomination this time here is nickey haley south carolina i would continue to rin i ni giving up this fi when a men tordive meri cans dis a truth of both donel trump and jo biy oget and then she says the donal trump drives people away and by polling data she has correct down trum is a highly polorizing figure that given tobitons muriad failures as president of the united states trump shold be up ten points over jobidon at this point even though he is up very slightly in the poles right now what can trump du to fix that we will talk about that a second here is nickey aily this has never ben about me on my poletical future we need to bed ju bidin in no vemberi tubele donl trump can be jobi nerly en tree day trump truns people away totin wit this tomments jest yesterday yet that may very well be true trum himself says that he as never seen the republican party as unified as it is right now but that obviously is not true i mean he is the incumben president he only one but when i say only that the big victory twenty points but the aredically he sho n eighty twenty not sixty forty tha means that forty per cent of the people voting the south careline primary did not want trump now it is an open primary there are democrats for voting in that primary but not everybody who out er fr nickey hailey is a democrat her is trump tralk aout the unity inside the party now this a spirit that i have never seen werin to gri ra s e ever e ever this never ten aspirt li thi an i just gon to say that i have never seen the republican bady unify as o e traver e what is trump strategy going to be here u some people think that he is going to try to diversify out his base by picking someon elike tim scot for vice president i think the answer here for for trump really is that i i think that he figures he is got everybody in the low propensity categary hi's gon avovoting maybee tax to the middle in terms of position and hopes that independent voter breaks for him what it seems he is really counting on more than anything else is forebiding not to be able to turn out the low propensity voter tht's how a terrible bat it just means the elections can be realy really closes when you are betting on the other side to fail as opposed yourself to succeed that can be a very serious problem it els it does not help when you have people my landell whis ivas the big trumpbacker out there telling people not to vote by mail st dud stop stop if yuif you want trump to wind you need republecans voting by mail and you need the voting early just get them to vot but here is rover loded froran ol ther we haut that we have been held tat we are in the the ther got a lot of problen but one of e thing to thin tin do when i ra prarenc e hur lass ere what came out of that there is argus the areenc e pelse te resolution paper bol can coni same day boly no early boly i and by the way ay a tha celsin o bot early is wrong you bot sam day in celling you that can tarder for them su she at or vote early or get your ballick counted now because democrats well ol get meanwhile in the best media story of the week end hirachek whose libs of tiktock sheckshe sat down with tailo lorens now tailo lorens happens to be a full reporter who spends all of her time these days basily tracking down hirachek its what she spends all of her time doing she is a colomnist for the washington post she used to report for it the near times and she has been spending all f her time trying to basically blame hia for anything bad happening in the country that if somebody follows hia on on her twitter account and all hide us on her twitter account is exposed people on the left for doing wht the're doing it is amazing to me the hatred forhia for literally taking vidos of people on tiktok and then just exposing them to a broader audience is lun she is breaking secret vidiotis youpl are putting obvidios of themselves talkin about transing the kids she takes it yhou brought grant to broader exposure and suddenly people react yend it is just that stupid left winged game rit large of o my god you notice them in your bad well now there is a fifty three menute long interview with hirachek between talolorens and hirchek in which hia really kind of shalac lorens because she asks her you non't you seem to think for example that it is o kade to show pornography to children in classroms you seem to think that it is fine to blame me for all of the activities of people who follow me which is a weirdthing for any one in journalism to believe here is a tal lorens by th wish es wering a mask out the wor in twenty twenty four

in nineteen ninety seven or whenever it was that was a middle school not not not a thing and yet she claims that it is and then talorens claims that if parencs want a kid to chop off their genitals

mean that is correct that is crazy sotalilarends she is just the a journalist and her standard is it must be somebody i believe that it is without any evidence and and you should you should apologized for that totally insane in these are the people in legacy meda there is reason we all hate the legacy media it is hard to think of people who are worse than the legacy media to be totally honest with you i mean an inis across the board just the disconnect the disconnect between ore legacy media and theamerican public is utterly wild for example here is a political reporter on emusan be see explaining that anyone who believes in god given rights is actially a christian nationalists this what the left us they take an actual term and then they brouden out the definition to exto to include everyone they hate right white supremacy is a term with a meaning and then they exthet the expand that out to include any one who thinks for example that meritocracy is good you are now white to primisist christian nationalism is a term with an actual meaning what it typically means is something akin to theocracy that law should be christian in orientation not just that it should take its values from christianity which is something that i generally agree with in the united states not that you should be man tated to go to church because tere is a separation of churchan states to that extent but that the moral under pinning of the united states of america is rooted in christian theology that mthere is no question that that is true aby the way is secular isin in the west they are roots historically in christianity clearly but what they say is the christian nationalism means anything that invokes god is now christian nationalisms that is hw you end up with this idiotic reporter hidy chrisbula trying to claim that the declaration of independence is a christian nationalist document the one thing that unit tole because here is many a different crips orbiting trumpit the thing that wri ot unites them as christian nationalist not christians by the way because christian nationalist this very def is that they believe that our rights as theamericans as all human beings do not come from any irthle authority that come from congress that a confess pin court they come from god you mean the declaration of independence t that that is literally the declaration independenceisshes calling a christian nationalist document now s again if you are on the right you are just whatever is the evil term of the day by the way the cuorrellary to what she saying is tit the only way to be nota christiaan nationalist is to believe that rights come from government that the government grants you rights which of course is ridiculous becase that assumes that all power ineatly resides not with the people not with individuals now the families now th communities but with the government that is not the way that it works the entire basis for american government is that we granted government certain specified powers in the constitution of the united states specified powers not unlimited powers and that we reserve rights to ourselv and that if the government invades those rights the government has failed to do its job and in fact has destroyed it is reason for existence but that is now i guess i a christian nationalists perspective o good news guise i guess ai'm now christian nationalist if that is the way the that works aready folks in just one second we will jump into the s an l episode starring shangillis had had some it had some moments if you are not a member become

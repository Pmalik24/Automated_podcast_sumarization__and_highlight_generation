a quick warning there are curst words that are unbeeped in today's episode of the show if you prefer a beep version you can find that at our websight this american life dot o work from v bsy chicago siys american life an myr class why are not you more mad i think i'm just too tired to be mad it is whon i think of tat i get exhausted i get a little desperit i coal feel a little bit i feel a little bit under water this my co work thers shown the col is te produco her in the radio show and the thing that broght him to the state is a bed night wight good a bed he does not have no he ordered it wag in september mi get when move to no apartment th ss wish have been sleeping since i moved and on the floor on my old mantress awaiting my new bet to speak queer the mattress for the new bed arrived right away after you orderdiys is roll up a berido near the window whenthe issue is the bed frame and the headboard the sto awall undelivered absent four months after ordering and i tiking to shot about this because today's programme is about all kinds of different sorts of run arounds and he is in the middle of a sort of cassic one one lots of is of experience for the record the bed that he ordered is a queen size bed from the casper on mine store as potcasts producer he told me he felt a living cochet ordering a product that is advertised on many pod cast but he says he rely the bed it is tat an angold cushion headboard to ween against when he reading at night chon is somebody as never really fixed up a place with nice furniture and he was finally getting round to it and he was excited and at first the deway was a completely exusable kind of thing the bed was backquarder which in happens wit th furniture must must be ready for delivery on november eighten but the eghteenth of november comes eightenth of november goes it does not show up at chomrech is out to casper ah they said you will here from our delivery partner ok get a tax from the delivery partner as coming i never heard of called or exo arixo texts me and says i we have scetceld your delivery for september twenty six and i'm it has not been september twenty six for s to monts choncals ary and resketches the delivery saturtis tim for a day this in the future not the past but this is the first of what will be many tax and communications from our exo tht make no sense at all the new delivery day os in three weeks the day finally arrives i get up stripp the mattress pull it off of the floor set it up to make it easier for them to take away suchainthing against which wranlce against the lawn office against my books wait for them rantani gets taxt tellig him his bed will not be delivered he neans three scetcer he cost find out why and they said ga know we cannot bring it to you because you ask for the haul away service to take away your old mattress wal could not this truck still drop off your thing even if they wornts in a holl an the old mattress ri yet good question why does not being able to take something away prevent you from brinings the dliveryes re scetceld for mo day tree days later men diy comes the tax saing is man be tuesday no expedytion why an i woun't hav after that the text again saying that now it will not be delivered tuesday and i call then and i'm what is the deal and they go others pen at truckbreak down nows lik o whend can it come now and the go oh hang on a second and they look at their notes or whenever the g on nor naway you are good for to morrow nos i am good for to morrow theyre yad because it is already been added to the round and 'm there a truckbreak what was that just something you said and a i still anothe answer of thit a to say this is one of the most annoying things about this kind of run around at every stage you get answerers that leave you short of squinting and scratching your head trying to understand them every explanation is ano explanation then tuesday i get up again i strip the bed i pick the matchess up off the floor i lean it up against the wall and then i get at tux saying your delivery is confirmed for thursday this time many cause there is no explanation at all just an apology thursday com and on thursday i get up i not stripp the bed nor do i call the mattress off the floor cause beginning to learn of course ey does not com and i call them and unlike it is going on then they go oh there is a hard hold on this order and i'm wises there a hard hold and they go oh an there was a duplicat on the order dock yet two bed frames and headboards here that are sketcuel for shipmen for the same person ithout a might be a mistake and they didn' wan a ship till they knew shahn wonders why didnt jis contact him an ask if you ordered two deds ersand also t is this been on his paper work from the star then that is always been the case ricte why am i only finding out about this now that means it was never going to come or something and and now you wondering is this even true that this prom in the paper work well know because it seems specific why would you make up something that unless it is just i do not know i do not know i guess the answer is i do not know and it is madnang then after thinking they had to deliver to beds to shan they admitted they din't have any they did we call doc search finally showed up with a bed but who was the wrong size which would shan back atd square one roly on a shan started to keep a record of all these intractions with our exo in casper and at this point it is eighteen pages long if this document were poem what would it be calit would be call john's a publishd poet by the woy ah how do you sleep when wechat to our exon casper to be company to find out how they do sleep at night given the treatment of shoncrawl the answer was refreshingly honest casper o ve pe of operations he melt admitting ye the last fr years because golb was supplied change hade been crazy casper has experience to quote a myriad of disruptions you did say that only a tiny portion of the shipping has done with our exo and they are trying to work with our ixo to improve things ninety per cent of their customers he said rate their experience with our exso favorably meaning ten per cent do not shan iss one intent pretty bad odds of piasme mi take is that they never actualy had to bed for him shan cause heas come this far does one start over for a dfferent company a run around it is different people different ways i'm the perfect person to give the run around to because i am a freeter naturally in disposed to flipping out om demanding aa result you sayn you would not do these thing i would not do these things i'm i'm the person who you wanto give the run around too because i'm not gun alike reach to the fan try to strangly even one i e i'm polite about it true ting got l worked up talking to me about all this but the harshest he ever got with casper or are ike is a strnly wordy demail thet sound i he was written by an english gentleman in the eareighteen twenty quote this is beyond unacceptable we sletme know it casper intends to do to rectifyd the situation yours sincerely i run around wve put in that weird information winbow were you cannot tell what the truth is w you do not get what you want in a contest of weels with some other personn or entity and goes on and on and on just as a man it tests you it shows you who you are to dana programme some very different kinds of run arounds and some very differen reactions to them the people were being push to the very limits s dto of us at gon forty eight hours sat the lot more hours this fir story is about somebody who shone ias being given the run around but the run round is bot something much more consequential to her wife than a bet fram and the woman it is happening to overunover she has to decide whether to cut her lossis and walk away or stay with it and fight er way through the porter brina smith if hirs rode about this for the new side the botmor banner explains even before this whole thing began renay's life involved a lot of running around she is busy got three kids work stays and nights as a home healthade when money's tight she also drives for door dosh in it is to cart she spends a lot of time in her car a lot of busy people but unlike a lot of busy people renye told me and mi produce her cris she usually chooses the slowest possible rout to her next destination because i'm scared of beltways i mean i do not do beltways thot take the long way everywhere whutd emeayou cere o beltmen just scared of all the traffic maney different lanes with cars my i ave ro bed anxiety nd my nerves or bed i think it is just many different lanes with just many cars flying past t you s i' just prefer nots a i'd rather go on a side rords is tey a rena peep lamet above this yet in' ike to go any bast forty five renate's commentment to the local roads just outside of balltimar where she lives we will sometimes id twenty thirty even forty minutes to her trips that is her nay the store i want to tell you started last spring when something went wrong with renaye snop benefits her foot steps her monthly money stopped appearing on her benefit is card fixing this took five or six trips to the social services office billing out times of paper work and three months of waiting this is ant unusual for her or any one on benefits finally a kind woman at the front desk et social services looked into her case and found some gletch in the system she fixed at for reney and the next morning everything was made right all three months of miss benefits showed up at once she now at almost three thousand dollars on her card the highest she would never had renae felt a wave of relief but a couple weeks later renaye went on line to check the bounce on her card ands everything was gone except sixty six dollars that is all i can really remember i thought it was a mistake i thought while le me get off the ap and i clear iday out and tried it again samething she called the number on the back of the car to make sure and found out again sixty six dollars first she was just confused then she noticed large transactions at stoors she is never visited ered washington d c where she never goes gas bellways she realized some one had somehow stolen her snop money the thousands of dollars she just gotten back on her card was gone and one afternoon this is were her run around began i've been reporting on social services snap in maryland and i've seen snap brot happening a lot ban ifits left sky rocketed from ninety thousand dollars and twenty twenty one to over a million and a half dollars and twenty twenty two snop brought his actually up across th you us the night had happened to rene she could not stop crying a nd could not sleep this is money she used to buy food for her cates without it she would have to pick up ectur jobs get behind on ren the next morning she march into the same government building she would been in many times before to fix the problem in person maybe shed get the nicelate again i went down tho the social services and the same lady that fixed the food stamps was ye have remember i' just fixed them for you and all the money that was going to come on your card she was almost since yers she said i feel bad for you because it is much she said i've never seen that much be take in at once am she said but i can tell you now they are nakina they are not on every fund anything the woman told renee be cause the stolen snap money is actually federal money marylan could not pay her back those a state white pollisy she said there was nothing wek she thait i really wish we could help you and then of course everybody in the whole causeyou know you are sittin there with all these people and the window everybody can hear you talk as you only walkin a couple steps to the window and to get the whole room looking at you at one time iv felt stupid im cryin in that arely crying in for people i try to hold my emotions back and it was hard that day i just putnt hold aback i first mat renee on the space but group for parents and maryland who used benefits snap there were lots of parents mostly moms riting insaying they had had there benefits stolen and there was renete posting all the time about what had happened to her and really trying to help every one else every one please read this she wrot if we all come together and report this to the police in social services than something may be done there were lots of mobs who had tried to get social services to refund them no luck they would also fouled reports with their local pleace nothing i talped to dozens of them and renee was in a category of her own she did far more than any one else when i got her on the phone backtan shed been playing phone and emal tin for days bouncing between every authority figure she could find the office of the inspector general for maryland social services the you estan d se which fun snap even the maryland legislature were she called delegat after delegate but at all got her nowhere i d er you tha went yet robin rammer e yet a and e wonl be that unfortunately no matter what are you he taid they are not on every fun the money the police were not any help either the cop a sine to her case office her timithy valice would sometimes take days to answer her taxs and did not seem to be doing anything he was a rooky who had not graduated the academy yet renated something i have not seen any one else do she decided to investigate her own case she was going to find the people who took her snap money one thing about renee she loves true time shows forty eight hours she knew how important the first couple days are in any investigation she was wery time was slipping away she went to the fact she had thi snap benifits ap had given her the details for every fradulant transaction all seven of them they included a dollar amount the date and the name of each dor therehad been big purchases some over five hundred dollars rene thought that may be those stores could rewine their security footage to the times of those transactions and may be identi fy the thieeves she text all this to off ser valas tha then iv i e tat my toun and one e i no tnou of te or no er that yo peopl you mi n tan cart i tan et te ti ferof all that thaty that e ty thank youand that she suggested the pleace contact the stores but nothing happened i fouh the fort of my tow most of the stores would not help her they do not show surveilance footige to customers only pleace but one manager at an international market agreed to check and thefl the bdyou of the people that fiti ao if ye thavty one to te wor fi pictured in one for fected tetto know of that te thriving away and all of a sudden renee was looking at the faces the people who stole from her itscurityfootage fm a sunday and early august it looked to be during the day was right out the foto was grainy but she can make out a middle aged man accetting the store then in a different foto a woman with a low bun and blue striped skirt with ha shopping cart and you fee direct te cart the people that foi it wont pa i and pay e the baby for you u aan in ta firtery you te people of all pa it o wu bae mor ye what if on the picture twelve hundred dollars a baby formula which seems weard but it make sense if you think about it formula is a very efficient way to confert food stamps into cash it is in every grocery store it does not go back quick ly me istent you can pack a lott of it into your car and in the summer of twenty twenty two there was a shortage of it renee had found the suspects and get away car the bout it showed them driving off and a toy what a many man but she still iad no idea how to find out their names their identities and even after squinting every which way te photoes of the license plate she still could not make out what it was if you look at it for a fore way ou could feer little better but than wan you really tor ea con fer to havto te arthur i te cane for thated taid that o yaror thir won renee texted all this to officeer valas he did not say much just quote i up toted the report with the information you have given me he also said he referred her case to the departments investigative an side her crime unets then he stopped responding for weeks thet now you ondy in for any of my fact tat ting if he had found

hundred valler thavwi e havin ben callit e ten mall te oter thiry thousan vallar an if not for me that from a fovan a aken from my fo then in late august renee receives a letter from social services it says they looked into her case in quote did not find a system error or that the card was used fraudulently there would be no refun other moms on the face bat group had got in the same letter a lot of them had given up in that point but renee reads the find pran she noticed that the bottom of the letter offered her the chance to appeal this find dane before judge tavidence i the e ca i them hat h fer hearing e atin aen ter fire e a a i got hrough that i ta the me the then clearly you people but i have noti eu that an hd a li that in woul corter wherever she was going to file in a peal it was a lot of money and some part of her just wanted to prove that this thing had actually happened to her but she had been robbed all she had was grany footage from one of the stores she wanted a stronger case if she could get better qualities security footage from another sore maybe she could identify the license plea wich could lead you to the criminals she wanted to go in person but again these stores were near washington d c a beltway an inher state highway in another beltway away ner car wasnit an great shape and teor according a er e and that is how i wount up picking up erenaye at her

brief period of time but they also said he was working on her case and after renang out through of balice he did start updating hor more he told her please found the skemmer that they think was used to steal her card number but then in november renee lost the appeal she had filed the judge complimented rena's tenacity saying she quote single handedly incapably investigated the crime and identified suspects but the judge also said that there is nothing in marilan law that requires social services to repay stolen snap funs and renae was not getton get our money back but she was still looking for some way and an attorney who volunteered to help her with her case said there is a way you can appeal the appeal renae thought it over she is itsup to you do you want to do another appeal and i'm no i said what is the purpose just to be let down over and over by different judges that are saying i'm sorry but thet on the other hand ats te guardy came this far why not try to have another appeal and do it again im my mind just goes back of worthy should i should not i shaer shouldn i answer i should she filed a second appeal there is actually one other way tthis whole thing could be finge congrasss could do something in kind of amazingly the sort of have the huge spending villd congress pass last month repuire states to reimberse people who have hod their stop benifit storing s

state senni and later her congressman who had been following thiss isshue introduced a bill that would fixs things in a permanent way it has by partisin support and looks it might actually go

fugitives who are still such obvious gringoes from wisess and the other cops they are born in the you ass they have family in mexico but they can never totally blenden either something about them is eventually going to betray them as america n that is the kind of fugitive they were chacing when i was with him a mexican american guy named amian selinas he is twenty years old from fresno california

disappear but abigail has become a pro at drawing them hout she told me earlier that morning about one of her new strategies she is created a bunch of fake face book accounts using stock photoes of a tractive women that she uses to catfish fugitives one guy as actually posted on a face sbook group looking to meet people heven used his real name a a o etaa a a get a a ma maney wahe wanted a smokes

over too and then she signed u the stakes feel higde her they gringoes coming across they col dist repeat their crimes on her side of the border she told me about the case of a padifile whos led to you ass he moved into a house near an tee one alimentary school where he was getting ready to look from morekids to a buse she was if we do not catch this ky to day who knows what he will do here in mexico when we arrived in thuana we parked across from the second barber shop nivan and ol begal began their surveillance as always they work under cover to day jeans and teashirts two friends headed out for a day at the beach abigal bought some nachoes from the shop next door slyly peering into the barber shop ivan put on a black back pack and walk by disguised i guess as a thirty something your old student then we all settled in the car and got comfortable staring through the windshields usually on stake outs evane's constantly turning oup the volume on bad bunny to day he is cint of bragging showing me dozens of photoes of the grengoes he is arrested likee your book of american fugitives then they get another call ninan i some one has left the apartment above the barber shop the person got into a gold hondu cord and drove away one of the agent says over the radio i think it is selinas then they take off cutting across forleans of traffic abigail cuts off the handa and they surround the car i'm watching them approach the car and this is kind of a scary moment only a few weeks before the cops had been in a shoot out with the fugitive from california moysass anivan got shop the team told me that they were worried that selinast too my come out shooting if fhe was corner i watched them pull a skinny guy out of the drivers seat and push him against the car he did not look to me the guydae seen in the most wanted posters then they take his wallet from his back pocket there is a california driver's license with the name damian selinus they get out their hancoffs wagani a then come an co ga you a ot o tha i be on de aa oe on eva u thotte mig a a not t aga a wone et n the gen i ti ma oma even after all toe build up there was still something startling about seeing the cops catch their fugitive it was sreal they start figuring out lagestics who is gan to take the gold handa selina seemed confused she start saying i will go that is when abigail interrupts him no you are coming with us oy theo yo boy e n you an i goin o ut us but is thaid that bi ood up gen is that are not given up what i tle i se evnn a an llteporthment but ian't abt tha mantuas selinas does not put up ta fight they stick him in the backseat of the car and i ask if i can sit next to him to ask a few questions they say sure but they put the biggest cop in the unit between us case selinas lunges at me but he does not he looks he just swoken up from a nap i not a just to beclare i'm not a lon horsemen at teti i'm a journa the why i'm a journal ya as a maoeverything o ta this whole day i'd been wondering what is his gagin if you how had he invaded authoritiece for almost two years i think i'd been expecting an angry sophisticated criminal the sgy after all was being accused of homiside but selina sis a kid trying to disguise himself as a man his mustacheis whispy he is wearing irridoridan sandals with socks forever west coast was tattued on his right arm he keeps saying how nervous he is but then he spins an tail about how he would only been caught because he let his guard down why did not he try to go further into mexico you stayed close to the border noa i no why the o i just not ti i notinonot an hourely tht my nos o avme any pinthino was ais nwanoiiio i you give up ai oin oni ad he tihe mes te were resying yourself to getting coff almost wante to ge o tasi abaga weaves through teep on a traffic wit the siron on were headed to the border to hand selinus over to uess authorities and then hevan puts on gangster's paradise and turns up the volume he tells me ask him if he is a rapper o bet are you rapper rea rand yeir see laus ma atha i your sonas onn and then they pulled up a vidio on evan selephone it is avidio of selinas rapping taken from his social medium wha wha did why you lynthin no tonf yenato ie vers selina seems calm at this point awbegal parche the car at the border and the mexican police march selinas passed a long line of feople the daily border cross ers an migrans who were waiting to enter the uess on foot they craned their nacks to look at the american fugitive a small group of uniformed ues officials is standing at the border one of the agents bends his knees in a blockers position as if selinas might make a run for it the ow we o we know all about ae got a o gote ba wa wani yais not what us ti a n wai the mexican police take off the mexican handcuffs and the americans put on american couffs it feels almost ceremonial the arrest is done the gringois back in gringo hands i watch the gringo hunders walk back from the border to their car they ha just arrested in a ledge murderer i looked for some kind of reaction i'm not for what exactly it hi five a look of accomplished men but there was almost nothing the unit chases and catches many gringoes that selinus was jus another name on their lists thered he had their next day's assignment a woman had kidnapped and drugged to child they too were likely living in teeon oa few weeks after the selinas chase i was talking to mysass the head of the gringo hunters he told me this thing he said that sometimes he is hang out with his friends who were not cops ahe gets this feeling that i think cops everywherk at the regular people just do not know how many bad guis are out there they doft know how scary you can feel the chase fugitive american stay in and day

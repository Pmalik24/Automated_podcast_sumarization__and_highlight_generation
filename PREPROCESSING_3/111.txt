how speaker ceven mc carthy announce is an impeachment inquiry into jobidon somehouse re publicans at threaten mc carthy's speakership and we review the vidio music awards i benthpure of this is benchvarro sho to day shows ponser baxpressbe pian thousands f my listers ov already secured their netr tdey tod join them expressy pianta cam fleshmen well it is now official yesterday the house speaker cen mac carthe announce that there would in fact beang impeachmen inquiry into jobidn surrounding all his activities with his son hunter as well as presumably the cover up that is been attempted by the do ja of any investigation into a hunter's activities including jo and here is a thing we already know a lot about this particular topic in fact there is a ton of evidence that is already out in public view thanks to the called lap top from hell you kno the one that was supposed o be russian dis in formation that was dismissed by the entire media in the month leading up to the last election cycle and here many of the things we know we know that hunter bidon has spen the last decade jet setting around to randum countries as a durilic drug atic prostitute abuser and he is been pickin up backs of cash on foreign boards well calling his dabdin on the phone to prove his connection to his daddy we know that tens of millions of dollars have flooded into hunter bidon connected business is or directly to hunter bidon we know that hunter bidon texted his own daughter suggesting that he paid his dads bills we know all of these things none of that is in disputes when people say there is no evidence everything i just said there is hons of evidence for all of that literally the only thing missing would be the con quoe smoking gone namely some sort of transaction between one of hunter bidon's business is anjo bidon's direct bank account but it does not require that to prove bribery or corruption and by the way jobidon is not being criminally charged bribery or cruption here is the thing the democrats broke the mole and when they decide they 're going to impeach donal trump without actually alleging a crime not once but twice when they said we are not going to attempt to push even a proscutorial motion of what crime was committed kno statute was actually sited in either of the impeachment papers thet were filed instead ther're general accusations of corruption general accusations of pressure and they can do that because that is when peachment is to political process but once you say tha you do not actually have to a ledge o crime in order to pushi im peachment and then you do it twice why would you think it is nocking to come around and clocku again yeu broke the glass the glass is still broken and here is the reality f re publicans did not do the same thing in reverse well then democrats who just continue to do this willin nilly theause they are two possibilities here in terms of going back to status po anty or people dingranimally just impeach the president of the opposing party there they'e to possbillis one everybody goes weapons down unless there is an actual full skale crime committed that could theoretically be prosecuted but could not be because the president of the united states is immune to federal prosecution while he is the president of the united states riht that thou'd be the the betterstatus glantye's tat we do not prosecute every president or ex president unless they actually commit a federal crime t and in hs to be completely even handed and how we actually pursue justice that be the better version and then there is the second version which is we just willy nilly impeach petty much everybody and from here until the end of time we impeach everybody an nat i suppose we can live with that to i suppose we can do that in onleats the best thing for the country persay but sure i suppose we c and that is where we now are yesterday cevn mc carthy announce that house comites would open a formal impeachment inquiry into pression o biden rapping up teop pe afforts to on earth any evidence of wrong doing ahead of the twenty twenty four election here was speaker mc carthy announcing this yesterday these are alegations of abusei power obstruction incrruction they ware further investigation by the house of representatives thats loto day i am directing our house committee to open a formal amd peachman inquiry into president jobin thes logical nec step will give our committee is the full power to gather all the facts an ansers for the merican public what sort of powers attached to an impeachment inquiry for ste non im peachentincgry the answer is not all that much all these comittes already had sepina power now presumably they wil just have a better excuse to use that sepina power theoretically if you are sopinad and your member of the executive brance you can say i'm not gon show by not con testifi because this is not within the normal purview of a congressional in vestigation typically congressional in vestigations have one of two purposes one is oversiht of an of a function that the executive is supposed to be performing i pass a piece of legislation at piece of legislation says the executive branch is supposed to disperse moneys in a particular way and now i'm sepina ing the executive branch told make sure that you did the thing that we legislated that you are supposed to do that is possibility number one possibily number too when a comes to congress and and legitimate purpose of a sopina would be legislative purpose is we are doing an in vestigation into this problems we can then craft legislation in order to pursue in end to this particular problem in impeachment inquiry provide to defense to he possibility oeare doing neither of these two reggyur you are not actily crafting piece o legislation on the one hand and youre also not doing an oversighte function of a of an executive job thats delegated by the legislature you doing something else another constitutionally performed duty which is in impeachment inquiry and if somebody says on one trump for thisoppenot theoreticallyou go to courting you say well you have to and andyou have to more than u normally would because even thouh it is not legislation an is not quite oversiht it is not impeachent inquiry in that is a natural function of of the house now what is this really what it really is jus the republican saying that we are kicking this impeachment stuff in to high gear now that there are few problems with this particular strategy from mc carthy problem number one is that mc carthy is doing this without a vote nansuppolose you did do this and nansiplocy did not take a vote of the house before she actually pursued impeachment of president trum and that alow the trump de ojay to claim that the impeachment inquiry actually did not have the authority to proceed properly now you assume that the by dmnistrations can o do the same thing they dn say you new take a vote in the house to open in inpeachmen inqirieso why should we respect the notion the season is legallyan impeachment inquiry were not con t even acknowledge is an impeachment inquiry ye you cannot justartan m peachmen inquiry was trums case actually when it was democrats in charge of congress trum's case was this is not michael scott shouting bankruptsyf just walk into a building shout i've open an impeachmen inquiry this does not attach any new powers to you was the case that trumpsteojay made that can now be used that axac case can be used by the biding deoja against kev mc carthy and and the house re publicans that is the point politico is making to day in canuary twenty twenty the donald trumplood justice department formally declared that im peachment inquiries by the house are in valid unless the camber takes formal votes to authorize them that opinion was issued by the justice departments oh ell see the office of legal council and it came in response to speager nancy plozy doing just that seeven angell was then the head of the deo jays office of legal council on said we conclude the house must expressly authorize committee to conduct in impeachment investigation and use compulsory process in that investigation before the committee they compell the production of documens or testimony to presumably the by dministrations goin to do the same thing now mc carthy was asked why he flipped on thes because mc carthy had suggjusted not all that long ago that eleven days ago than if yous can to move on an impeachment inquiry than who is coin to do with the house vote then he did not do wit the house vote just declared i've open an mpeachment inquiry and dom and yu's asked about this an hes o woll what is good for the goosicgor for the gandr nancy plocy did that and now we can we can do the same thing which again is true but it does under score a bit of weakness in this impeachment inquir whis will get to in just one second first let us talk about th weakness of the american accim mar now got new economic numbers coming in will talk about in a little while i got tell you they are not good it it people are having a hard time finguring out wer to put their money i am and thin prey much everybody as you put it in reals that will sike the reals they market is cruisin for a bruisen you put it in the stock market looks the stock market is overvalued when you lookatly price to earnings ratios where t you put the money one thng could do it is take at least some of your money and put in precious metals as a hedge hay that that is just

feel secure then start diversifying we me nist have some gold to depend on in toug times again text ben to ninety eigt ninety eight ninety eight to get start o ca the the failure to wanch the im peachment inquiry with avote there there is something happening that one things that is happening there is that mc carthy may not actually have in majority in the house to open the impeachmen inquiry in other words he does not actually have all of his re publicans on board remember he asn' in ridably slim majority in the house of representatives right now and all it would require is just a few of these people to drop off and and you do not have a majority at all in support of something likt in impeachment inquiry again wright now the constituency is two hunder twenty to republicans in to undred twelve democraps and you require two hundred and seventeen two hundred eighteen for the majority all he has to do is lose five republicans and he does not have a majority in support of an impeachet nquiry instead he is doing it without the vote hre the problem is an if you do not have support to open i impeachment inquiry hirigan achly vote for m peachment is he writing a check that he then cannot cash because an impeachment inquiry that ends with not impeachmen looks an exoneration if the opposing party opens an impeachment nquiry and then says whell you now what foraget it it turns out which i't have the goods tholk's terrible for re publicans mc carthy is opening in vestigation and it is unclear in which direcsion this is going to go which raises the question as to wy exactly he is doing that one piece of speculation there there is for the principale reason there is the non principal reason both are possibilities the principales reason to open in impeachment inquiries because there is actually as i say huns of evidence that jo bidon an hunder bidn ere involved in corrup bargaining together that that evidence is widespread it exists it is out there yeshe do not even need all that many additional facts and i wonder what they think they are going to discover here thas can a change the mat the only thing i can think that an impeachmen inquiry might discover that we do not alread is jus the level to which the do ja was pressuring people david wises tock ae sweethart to go ith hunter bidon to kill any investigation in to hunder bdons relationship with his dad financially at that is the part that is the other shoue to drop that presumably is why keve mc carthy is talking about notjust corruption or abusive power but allso obstruction of justice at the idea that the doj was weaponized on behalf of the bidan family in order protect joe from his corrupt relationship of hunter and that weu might find out the impeachment the principaled reason to open th impeachment inquiry is cause you think you'r actully going to get more in formation via the impeachment inquiry than you would otherwise and then there is the sort of un principal reason and that is mc carthy is under seveur fire right now from the madgates wing of the party and again that wing is really small just by by actual mumbers it is a vast manority of the re publican parity matgates is putting a tremendous amount or pressure on kep mc carthy with regard to spending and hes threatening his speakership right now and one way if youre coven mc carthy to avoid that is fort pressure is to go back to the basin ay liston i do not you want for me i'm giving o whatyou want and given mou theimpeacment inquiry i'm going after jobidon i'm i'm one i's pride concessions out of jobidon who is your alternative maybe in response to the pressure he opens the impeachment inquiry and thus avoid to speakership fight that is the that is the more cynical reason tat youwould open in impeachment inquiry without of a tures matgates yesterday trying to presshmc carthy i rise to day to serve notice mister speaker you are out of compliance with the agreement that allowed you to assume this roll the path forward for the house of representatives is to either bring you into immediate to tal compliance or remove you pursuant to emotion to vacate the chair mister speaker you boasted in january that we would use the power of the cepina and the power of the purse but here we are eight months later and we have not even sent the first opina to hunter bine that is how that the rosh and you are somewhat rattle performance you just saw from the speaker is it real at this point during democrat control over the house of representatives theyt are he brought in don junior three times and we have not even set the first cepena to hunter bod nay zo again the synical reason here is the mc carthy his basically saying that oka and now i'm doing it am bringing in everybody were can do the copina power canto all those sorts of things here is the reality when the sort of quixsotic quess to get rid of speaker mac carthy i said thits at the time i do not understand what concession ar trying to pry from him if you can name me the concessions that you think are going to make governence in the house better and more conserve ve them all for it chip royded and we had chipryoun the program at the time when they were having the speaker fighted nes said what you want from mac carthine you listet a bunch of things i saidn't mac carthy gives you those things wil ye support him nuws i guess if tht is a position the make senseyou must not a position the make sense i do not speak o mc carthyan he should go and i have an alternatives i'm just going to yell about things got that is not a strategy and it is not a plan what exactly is it that you are seeking to achieve at this point at's mc carthy is now opened the impeachment inquiry senerc havin cramer of north to coda call the in quiring to propriate step for the republicans send it minority lidr mih macconnal said m carthy did not need his advice on how to run the house which is a god way from mac connall to avoid that fight ites a mtter a mac conall has to say anyway since he is not the majority leader he has no power to actually preside over any sort of senate process for full scale removal from office even if bid were to be impeached over the sorts of charges represent om kenbuck of colorado head argued an inquiry be un necessary because of existing committeeinvestigations he said the mc carthy made a good decision to not hold the vote he said it would ave distracted from the work were trying to get done which would have been the a tempt to fund the government to again the powers that have been extended to the house are relatively miner here all it really does is in very public terms it says we know that you are corrupt and we are going to come after you with whatever powers we have at our disposal and that is not a bad thing i thing that is very worth while thing for as i said two purposes one is mutually sure destruction if you get t keep impeaching republican presidents over and over and over just because you do not them whel then we are going to do the same thing to your guise and we will se ow you it mutually sure destruction is one way of gettng ap ridyback down and the second is at do not bidn actually is deeply corrupt and has been eeply corrupt for decades on end when just one side will gets the democratic response to the to the impeachment inquiry first let us talk abut bon

this point the republican house overside committee is going to preside over all of this apparently mc carthy says that hes can to have james comer of centucky take the lead on the impeachment in where he is in a work alongside umjordan of ohio and jason smith of missoury again it its it did not require majority vote to do this the fact that e did not have a majority vote makes this is somewhat risky move because the question is goin to be where the get enough republicans to vote in the ends toim peach jobidn on whatever they uncover none the less democrats our fighting mad about it as you would imagine chucksumer the sentate majority leader i he is now using language that we remember from om from the trump days member when when trump would say that it is that is a whitch hunt which hunts remember that in retty much everyqweat and i'm it kind of was whell now chucksumeris adopting that language i think the impeachman inquiry is ebsurd the american people want us to do something that will make their lives better not go off on these shases and which hunts oh in what that i notice tht you delicated tens of millions of dollars to chasten whitch hunts when it was presenten trump again turn about is fair play when at comes to poltic senator dic durban i thought had sort of the quote of the day here he said sure i mean his behaviors werd and kana corrobut tthere is nothing here i me come on i not thing bu broke the waw or the thirsur bein pub e bolan oo to e about the situation wo woroks o the sono doters cap wis an on public o ther chamen o er cares ts su osers porsions o on fast forward on this if this house inquiry turns into a forblon in peatchman and i have to say it is hard to imagine a dozen tanan an i can a doing i peachmen inquiry in then clear presen bidn rit i mean is the bottom line looking forward that this no way in peachment supporters are going to get two thirds of the sena bid will be quit this is just he diversion on the part of cart he cannot cove he cannot cav hs majority in hehouserers that as to do the basics to keep governments ligt to and is to sude for a diversion lets talk about something else tho the might egree an i peachen what a waste of time an money i love the dic turbans gat he might be supercorrupt anda it is it is really ugly but to waste of time and money first of alt when have democrats in legislaturs ever cared about wasting time and money jery connally who is involved in the impeachment of presdent from hible boath times congressman from virginia he he he also says is i's a distraction it is is distraction for our vital work o a wasting your money why now we are in th this stract eys right yow lo this ones tarleys id i toso ever get to peach tos at commonplace i think is al to distract us for fact that i don chok is tonen tin for tot tope times there ningi one counts pending against him he is adin onus legal carol i and they do want us to cok us o that letstraten to connatlo and sur ow that is to hav lineit to daysment i mean that works in reverse as well as a possible you ges a filed four dfferent indictments against present in trump in themidle of an elections heason because you wish the headline to be that as opposed to jobine being crapp at his job and also corrupt john fetterman has emerged frommum from frankinstine's laboratory i to to he is a different look john fetterman he used to be that he was sort of a tracks suited never do well and now he apparently has graduated into a into a low level muscle ind forser for the suppronos here is john fetterman's response while walking through the hallways of the congressional basemens on his way to a to bounds outside bar i w were he explains a how how upset he is about this impeachment eha formelly mich a think lii oely o li ush o its tevis to to te ton to oo o similarly his reaction to learning that scouby du had been moved in his timeslot on cartoo network n the john fedderman your senator from pennsylvania well done america

correctly are pointing out that when you got sit is masing te media cover to the slicht with no evidence at all re publicans open im peachmen inquiry now as i say the evidence is superlong am there is a lot of evidence the jobidon not only new but was involved in hunterbidon's business ranging from the tacs from hunter bidin to chinese magnates talking about ten per cent for the big guy to tacts directly to people he was working with talking bout how his father was sitting directly next to him in woud make life for them incredibly uncomfortable this appoint made by a representive scott parry of pennsyllane thusiast about owhat do as you have evidence to do theses ofm yes ats wi evident te hav of the pe te atigatito sent ett a o covinin that we merit an ac whenin e en in quiry all to vit an inpruveint to day jus tevact fom te yoido kno ma copany to the sat of an acting penit isic revenge wthis is not ofout te notabal revenge we have the bank accounts we can see man you can see that the homes that the bines own cannot be afforded on a and a congressional or sentats salary you also understand that it is not normal for family members to receive millions of dollars from oversees interest those things are normal that is not normal have twenty self shel country companyes these things are not normal and it alludes to not only just bidespread corruption but money landering if not influence peddling itself and we also have the president ought of the vice president at the time on record sing that the prosecutor was for well son of a tha prosecutor was fired right because the prosecutor with going after the the company that his son was working ouht that is what we have if you cannot see that if you are of you are a that blont he happens to be criing whele margery tall agreeing corectly points out that it is not juss that it is also the possibility the jobidons doo jay was shutting down investigation we would do already have wistablowers who said as much i'm very excited to see a happen i think a mari cans to serve trath that this our chance pancy and le nan the sinvestigatsion tegalis long as that nan sin to an cover all the correption that its then anvolved an cavering at chabidans crams et again not wrong on any of this now democrats are already trying to spend this into whill what about jerd and vonca and all all the rest of that sort of thing his first woll jeurnovonca were actual employes of the federal government hunter was never in employ you the federl government while jobine was vice president hunter was just going around as a bag man for his family for milt to milt the ton millions dollars and calling his daddy in to meetings in order to demonstrate that he had flects with the federal government that is not the same thing as you are a federal imployee whose worked on things that abrahamicords which by the way the most successful midly's pease initiative of the last two generations which is what jerred and avonca we are doing during that time tand then after you leave office then you rend up doing a business deal that is publicly disclosed in all its details publicly disclose howdo we know about jerds investments with the souties in viceverssa because it is all publicly disclosed as bost a hunter bidon who hid this crap fore years and there some pretty significant differences right here obviously but what we are goin to conflate all the things at the same time of course in the end how much is the inpeachment stuff going to damage jobin it it is only i a damage jobidonif i just means there is additional attention brought to his corruption see corld av done that theoreticaly without in peachmen wilkian be a bpeach i dontknow and you can have to get four five republicans in purple districts on board in order to do that but one thing is being under scortfor democrats and that is jobidon continues to be an extraordinarily weak candidate the economy is not doing well under jobid it is just that simple according to axios a measure of poverty track by the cents his bueau rodes in twenty twenty two as covet year benefits expired n average in come fell according to a twosair port chow poverty sa a sharp increase in twenty twenty two following a record loaththe year prior now the reason saw record low is because jobidon spent a be jilian dollars just pouring money on the raging flame of inflation and turning it into a huge gas firer that is engulf the entire american economy and then that was not renewed and the is it will youre increasing chil poverty becauswere not signing giant checks to people well ya i turns out that when you signe enormous amount o money over to people that temporarily relieves their poverty but does not permanently relieve their poverty the only way to truly reduce chil poverty in the long term in the united states is ohave a growing a conomu were mom and dad our marriedand have jobs that is that is the way the eare sod reduce chil poverty long turm not by simply signing checks jobin in courseis blaming his political opposition but the reality is that the democrats use covid as an excuse to blow money out the waw zo for three stree years and that was not maintainable as we can see from the inflation rate as we can see from the stagnating economy median household income at fell by two point three per cent from twenty twenty one to twenty twenty two adjusting a fourt inflation incomes decreased in white and not his fanic white household that remain similar in black asien and his fannic households and inflation rose seven point eight per cents in twenty twenty two on onannualized basis by the way me've new inflation stats out to day and it turns out that the seepie that contumprycennec climbed three point seven per cent in the year through august thot was faster than the three per cent three poing two per cential irating and even faster then the three point six per cent that economis had expected sof cors thare blaming this on high gas pricis which means that jobiden as goin to try to cut some sort of sweet hart the old souties in order to get them to pump gasin gan as to artificially boost his reelect chances but these are bad numbers can remember we'r's posto be seeking two per cent the diversine two per cent in three point seven percent we are almost double the expected in flation rate in this country right now and even a lot of democrats are starting to look cross ied to jobidon say i do not know why we are running this one why now the real reason the running this one is because the're trying prevent in internal fire fight over comela harrison side the democratic party thi's the problem whenyou pick in a firmative action candidate four v p as ap pose d the best qualified candifor te jobidon couldn'at chosen any one for b p comea haris did not bring out the blackvoat shou 'd not bring out any one comela harris is one most alienating politicians of our lifetime if jobi ad want to pick a qualified v p get a bunch of people to choose from mean even on that stage with him when hofs running in twenty twenty ther'r bunch of people he easily could have chosen as his v p candidate most obviously some mo lice amin clobichar from ansot he didn he decided not to do that instead he went with comela hrris who ise off putting and widely despised and the're trying prevent of fire fight from breaking out inside the democratic party over comela as they got leave the old man in place but democrats are staring to take op his pullmumber sock wo dividignacios democrat writing for the washington posed has an entire piece todate thadtl president bidin should not run again in twenty twenty four he says what i admire most about presidn a pidness that in a pullorized nation he has governed from the center out which of course is a joke he 's governed from the left the hard left but i do not think thet bidan in vites presidenen harris should run for reelection i love that es sneaking in the vice president harris ray there thif as president harris comela harris she is not eighty comela harris is in the prime if her political life an the'e all ready can we dumper off the side of this ship lebrig right now ll push the old man and if she goes that wuld also b great i do not think bidan and vices presede in harris hould run for reelection says daviding nacius it is painful to say that give my admiration for much of what they have accomplished but if he and hrris campagn together in twenty twenty four i think bidon risks undoing his greatest achievement which was stopping trum bide would carry two big live bilities since whet twenty twenty four campaign he be eighty two en he began a second term that is liability number one and libilding umber to his harris jus a thirty nime point five per sents approval rating according to five a thirty eight harris says daviding nacius has many loudable qualities but the simple fact hish has failed to gain traction in the country or even within her own party bidon could en courage a more open v p selection process that could produce a stronger running mate and the i low this he says we should start with the mayor of los angelist carran bass ulook out look out that the interosectional democratic carty they cannot karid of coma haris cause they do not have a black woman backer up his first move is what about carron bass who barely b rick cruso who is a republican in alli or commer secretary gena ray mondo yat that there would be a charmer gena ray mondo the commer secretary that woithot'd be amazing graga but there ther's the desperation is starting to set in among the democrats which of course is why the dmocratic party rigge the primaries in the first place as ar if ca junior is now pointing out in the wallster journal he says his become clear the d n c does not wanter rail primary and is willing to disen franchises democratic voters from choosing their nominate the d n ce has refuse to host debates though vast ma jority of democratic voters want and expect them they can judge which candidate has the popular appeal and vigorto challenge the republican nomina the d'ancy has revoked new hampsires sentury old status's first primary state in theire placey with south carolina gauvse biden one south carolina but lost both new hampshire and ioa the d'anc as rafted rules that if candidates run ind unsanction primary new hampshire the d'anc chairman has the power to punish them regardless of the marchin of victory such a candidate would receive zero delegates further the jeorgia democratic party has a rule allowing it to ban from the ballat any kandidate who does not follow danc rules sar kgunor's pointing out a vearity rigg this thing bidon stepped in and he rigged this thing democrats are stuck with jobiton which is the reason presumably why the impeachment inquiry is really bad for gobiton agan if you are talking about your bine that is goodthng for republicans and if fou tung bout donal trump that is goodthing for democrats that is the simple simple mav an just one second we can get to jo bidons foibles over sees because we are seeim new in formation about the six billian dollar gimmy that bidon just signed over to te aronians which is the preylude to a brauder eron deal that presumably we will give them much much much more access to cash to they can pursu their terroristic intent first when you runing a business your employs can crate all sorts of fascinating situations from remote employs and how to hiretop tallen to improving company culture this is why you need totalk comammies when

this happening right here is in open invite to the aronians to make some sort of deal that looks ther on newclear deal that aron newcleardeal fellowpart because the ronians were breaking the neuclerdial and donal tromples i' not interested in doing this this nonsensence he pulled out of it jobidon has been lazer focused on trying to put that back together even including in the negotiations people rober malley who is originally in obama envoy robert malley entered up being basically band from the state department he was leading the diplomatic affort on aroun's newclear programm and then congress learned that the statespartmn had suspended his security clearance because of an investigation into possible mis handling of classfight information which aftly elevated to the f ba level ou not a great chocter that robert malley is is not a perticuarly gogi he was one who as leading up the negotiations with aron call wit their hand in the cooky jar giving aron pounts of cows just roccobomeded now the the obot now the white house is claiming that actually none of this happen it is all in your imagination here is the statespartment'spokes person yesterday mathmiller

here teithere ar on's funs these are a rons fo when when i that is ridiculous as think the police sees a drugdealar's funds and then in sweetheart deal they released the druggular's funs do they give the rugular money well i mean yah i gess he could say tha it was the druggular's money but he is a criminal it is not his money that is the whole point that is ridiculous and then thi's even better the ronian president yesterday he he goes on with thun with i believe lesterhold and he is explaining that actually there jus can use the money whatever they want is he bramratasy he we been told that this money is not going bus for terroris m or anything that woul threaten american interest ich conbuseful food and bandades and stuff and rse he is nomin use of whatever i want actually what is your expectation of it toous for tro that its for you maniterrian purposeous food and medisin do you believe ou have a right to use that money in any way t you see it ooat i le e oyou tes mon blize to tel make to public ub ye wan s i that shoi wa will diside disni make i public wub ye won with tiside tis thatto dispend it ce then weten how tispend o money al fors i tis fun do do thought is youf dhislui e public oe ro i'm yabers can usit ver whatever we please is what he ben he monhe he says my fever part of this is where john curby's no it is not true they cant they are wrong i'm i do not believe you i do not believe you john curby can john curbat when a get your every action the administrations for action to present is te saying that the arans will fend the six fillion dolars coat wherever we lat it well that is not true a the system is set up such that a this money a these funs a can only be parcelled out for demanditarian purposes food medicine a itll tha construction of a medical facilities or even educational purposes a but that e chould every throug withdraw is gon to go through a series of checks and balances checks by the treasury department checks by the curdery national back oh the the catary nationalmit yes very trustworthy tha that is cone be and and then once detectually in the aronian pocket they are nock it it is hore dicuilous but this administration is ridiculous what one of one of the key ways that that the left his wrong foot it is when they ju start lying about what it is they are doing you point out theire doing it thig no were not doing that then youre know you you actualy are yes of course we are but it is not bad that we are doing it which of course also applies to what they have been attempting to do in americas public schools the entire fight that is now happening across the country over removing wildly inappropriate material from school libraries books gendr queer wich are basically distpronography removing these from school libraries democrats men saing this aform of censorship well this turn into a very weird hearing yesterday when senator john kennedy of louisiana he was listen wont redulton's room i'm to read into the congressional record one of these books that you suggest must be in a school library nless e if you get uncomfortable is if you are un comfortable then maybe it should not be in a school library ware seventh graters can read it the first one is called all boys arbod and i will quote from i put sloop on and got him on hisdays and i began to swad in to him from behind i pulled out of him and kiss him wiley masterbet he ash me to turn over while he slip th condem on himself this was my all and i was struggling to imagine som one himsid me the entime me doas lik what a weirdo why would john kennedy read that outlet whel if your if you think it is weird then edultes is reading that why do you want a sixth or seventh grater to read that i notice that it is you ware promoting this material and when john kennedy says the thing out loud then you get all up tight wee some sort of prude e hell is wong withthese people honesty got they live my favor part of this was dicturban senter from illinois suggesting that nobody's advocating for sextual material to be available to elementary school kids right i mean tachnically you wanted to be vailable in fifth grade not forth grade middle school is what youre saying no one is everocating for sutuexcluso co to to be available theno mentry school library or children siction library that is ta distraction from the real challenge i what it is a distraction from the real challenge u than i've question why shouldthat even be available in a colabrate for high schoolers why should tax pars be funning the sortograp if a local schol district sides thetn't want that there what business is it of dic durban to decide that tdat it must be there whatis what is the reason why that must be is that a piece of great literature that is required for you pasture english comp class i i think i think not aget they have to deny thei'r doing the thing they are doing no where not doing it but it is good that we are senteem seems to be the argument at at all times frum this crue at can meanwhile on the republican side of the ile some movement in the poles in ioa nows the the front runner in the republican party remains by leaps and bounds donald trump but he has heen a significant drop in the iwat republican caucus according to emerson college just a few months ago he was it well over sixty per cent in that pole i in that emerson college polly's nune to forty nine per cent which the drop of thirteen per cent meawhile governor rondosantis and my pencs is numbers also drop from made de sants his numbers were at twenty per cent in may there non fourteen pence decrese from five per cent to three per cent you'v seen some gains for timscott and nickey haley and the vake romas uammy all of them still running well behind donald trump obviously rondosantis who remains the national the national second place han ave runner up right now by all available pull metric he appeared with norah ofdonald last night and hou's talking bout the age presidential candidates obviously this does not justiply jobinat obviously also applies to donald trump age has become an issue in this presidenttial contest should voter is worry about the ages of presient bon on fomal president donal trophic i absolutely legitimate concern the presents he is not a job per some one that is eighty years old than there is nothing and a wrong with being athe office the om the governor florida i know a lot of people who were elderly their geat people but you are talking about a job were you need to give it a hunder per cent you nee we need not energetic president and i think that if the founders could could kind of look at this again i do think they probably would av put in age limit ah on some of these offices get that that a'll made very well be true here is the reality inside the republican party there is only one way that some one is going to beat donald trump i cant therian to have to make the following case donald trump lost in twenty twenty and i will not that is the only case that you can make that is the only case thet com be made is on hme about age is in him gat temperament because republicans very much hant of donal trums combat of temperament and some the wild stuff on true social tht do not mind it that the cand of enjoy it the thnk it is fun it is not him done on the bases of record because most republicans think tha donal trumps reckor the first three years of his present as he was good even if he did not really know what he was doing with the buracracy in fact that shlly chalk up to his benefit side the fact that he did not know what was going on toe burah recsy becaue then they say that buracracy tried to thwart him and look at all the things that he got done in the face of that puracrasy he will definitely to a better next time the only way any republican is going to be don trump in the republican primaries is by making a very simple case you lost in twenty twenty twa dead man you are going to lose again in twenty twenty four to a dead man you are going to spendthe entire year lockd up in qort you'e going t be whining on truth sociallyou no can spend a dollar on actual electioneering ou're not to spend five minutes outside of marlogo or off a truth social and those are all obstacles to you winning the presidency somebody is going o have to make that case the problem is i think all the republicans in the race are afraid to make that case because they are afraid that if they say that trump lost in twenty twenty theyr entire audience isgingto disappear but here is a thing if tons from one n twenty twenty of course we should nominat hm an twenty twenty four heither wonere wass for there is no third possibility if yeu lost in twnty twenty we should pobably run somody else is he lost and if ye won and twenty twenty we should for sure run him because he will win again right this is the entire debate and if no republican is willing to save the obvious which is trump lost in twenty twenty cause we did not keep be in the white house right now not signing crap yor onduls well then who the helsgan overtake him in primary o meanwhile i have learned according to reports for my producers that does somethng all the vidial musical words happene last night the viames is empty vs viames and dum it is starred such vaunted names as diddy an chicure us apparentl we have time travel back to my high school days which is exciting news veamates have not really been superjuperelevant for a long time but ever often they just try another shock tactic it is according to my reporters on the ground savy was responsible for this sagmen i've been told that basicl it was pretty blassa it had the usual keeping helping of quasy nudid and and all the rest this was led off by a bran new song from those artists of the spoken word the shakespears of our time magan th stallian t h e because you are the stallion magan th stallion and cardy b och two of the great artists n in the panthion of the cannon it is gin a goa batoven broms gurshwin jon cage cardy b as that is haw that is howt's going to go it is can be amazing they have a new song ah that they are their prior hid was of course wap which which i did a better version of the native and thei'r new song is called bongoes they'v just moved round the back wap was of course about thefemale gentalia and bongoes is about the booty taking e a taking a page from sexy red an now they to be fair my understandin is the bongoes does not derectly talk about the anis in the same way that sexy read does ah which is of benefit to us all but bongoes is about the a the but cheeks apparently we we ave we are we are a we are a nation with deep spiritual value an connection to undying beauty that that is what we are their new song bongoes they did a they did a the version of it at the at the viamas i feel i can predict where they are going naxtragh the're only a few other body parts ther i i assume that next is going to be the boob song right i thy did wap they de bongoes they have to move tothe boobs i sume naxt he her they here they were last night tese these geniuses of creative enterprise we matellinsamass o french theyr working in takin ther thyre o ma an i oli not not thav on hen their's tailr an timagingis r magin main magin magin py power fr for yellow li eom the ke and ato is just lot of orkin low this is this i what a di splay what what incredible display of athleticism and and female class this is what women fought for generations to gain access to this i this is women for generations felt as though they were living as as as though they were under the heel of the picturarical society and finally ave achieve the liberty to be actual quasy prostitutes on screen which is something they never had before except for literally all of human history to shake their bongoes for money a that never have women achieve this sort of this sort i mean except for in all socides at but but except for that true feminism at work again i'm just this is how dum this stuff is become we are now tht they have basically decided that they'are going to do the sectual version of head shoulders neesin toes it is you kow the song that you sing with your smalk eads head shoulders neesentos nesentos now but it but sicgly bodily orifices it isots it is years nostrils mouth and wap mayyo that t they are running out of body parts and thee they are will not come a point where tey run out of body cavities andthey have to start going to actual internal organs it is a thing tht they are going to end up with right they are running out a body cavities to rest ins on nvthe gin to rat bac or small in teston that is right that is way this is oin to go they are having trouble to finding exactly what hot is i ssoom they gon to write a song next abut heirapiglotis this i this is where we are going they have hokturing to get to songs about the spleen i'm personally very much looking ford to a song about the liver i think that the prossing of bile requires some sort of of extended meditation from cardyb and magan these stallion our cultures is in the best of hands meanwhile tailor swift on best pop award because

burning mean to when the counter culture becomes the culture transgressive stuff is actually incredibly boring in wore f fou transgress against the thing the thing has to have some sort of cultural cashat or power somebody walks around doing the madona routine the stripper saint routine that she did in the early eighties it has no cultural penetration at all because it is because the church has no power in american society any more unfortunately the samething is happening cure now right if you act the nineties than satanic imagery used to really shock people why because we dn't satent thing was bad right we all knew that satanic imagery was a bad thing now because we have basically flattened out all moral ground in the united states and we are supposed to a tain are or great moral attainment will be m moral apathy thing more apathetic you are about everybody else's morality the better a person you are you spe that if you cared about morality and you care about people seeking a higher good or a higher life this is what made you moral now if you actually care about the suff mane you immoral it is not transgressive to have strippers dancing round in satanic gear it is actually just them representing the regime here is a doja cat again a a woman named after merouana and her cat which as we say mean it is it is ii i i hesitate to even to even compare her to poets of the past

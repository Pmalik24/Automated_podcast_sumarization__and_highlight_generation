florda govrnor ron to sansto suspends e george soros back prosecute for failing to prosecute crime disnte gets cold cock by the market and by nomics is the new cokue of economics programes i benshupero this is venhpirit sho thes showas ponserbaxpress the pano tand tostand up against betec protect or data pestupiandicom flesh men well there is some politicians who say there gon to do the thing and then their some politicians to actually do the thing while rondo santis continues to do the thing at least where he has the ability to in the state of florida and yet another headline that is going to make tin your times go nuts the headline to day to stantis suspends second elected prosecutor in flortus what exactly happend here well the governor has the ability to suspend certain public officials for failing to do their job and yesterday govrnor do santis suspended the topstate prosecutor in orlando he accused herofren compitence an neglective duty for he charactrisis lenients against bilent criminals is a forty page report from the governor's office demonstrating her lack of a prosecuting crime she of course is a george sorros back prosecutor she is somebody who is in favor of a sentually decriminalizing crime and here is the governor announcing her suspension yesterday mon equar els administration of criminal just ise in the nine sircit has been clearly and fundamentally derilet as to pconstitute both neglactiv duty and in competence the policies er practice is listed in our zecutive order a suspending her a conde constitutes the grounds o suspension ar as follows a one a patternr practice to avoid minimum manditory senenceis for gun crimes patterner practice to avoid minimomanditory sentenceis for drug trafficing offences patterner practice allowing juvenil offenders to avoid serious charges and in car seration altogether patterner practice to avoid vallid applicable sentencing in hancements patener practice limiting charges for chal prnography paterner practice for seeking with help with helding of the judication in situations not permitted pander florida law now superboring right superaccept this is the stuff that actually moves the ball forward in terms of making people's lives better in places orlando because the fact is that the place were she persided which would be the ninth circuit in florida had eight as per centage droped of cases non prosecution cases forty two per cent of theht refurls that were made to her office were then droped by her office forty two per for in ten and govrnors sent says well that is literally not toing you job you are ropis you prosecute crime now the way the medio play this is of course that it isto partisin hitjob fuote the move was the governor's latest aggressive use of executive power against local officials of the opposing political parties just to be clear it is really bad when governor do santis osides to fire a prosecutor in orlando for failing to prosecute crime that is it that to misuse of executie power to go after an opposing political official when you are the president of te united states and yourdepartment of jostis goes to after the person whois currently leading the primaries in the opposing party over crimes that when done by members of your own party were completely exonerate an whitewashed when that happens that is just good law inforcement when merit garland goes afternonal trum good lawinforcement when rondistants as fires a proscute for not duing a job political had job according to our wonderful medea toe sants suspended monik worral the elected state attorney of florta's ninth judicial circuit which in cludes orange and o shalla counties and sited as reasons her handling of three cases and a low over all in carcerationrate among other things hithe second time in a year that de santis has done this but to be fair this also happens to be a period in which a bunch of prosecutors got put in place who do not proscue crinfact things ave gotten bad on crime that hilariously enough a dc council person yesterday literally suggested that the national guard be called into washington to see to stop crime which is hilarius because you'r member that tenter tom conton of arkansaw rode an op ad in the middle of riot summer twenty twenty suggesting the ay be the national guard need to be call in to to quell riots and this ended with the firing of the opad editor of the york times reven deering to run a pease suggesting that thing now you have dc council mepers are suggesting the same thing about washington d c itself the santis said that theyd charge cases in this particular district an ways that woud avoid all of the manitory minimum sentences for oth gun and drug traffikin crimes the allowed juvenals to avoid serious charges or in carceration he said prosecuters hav a certain amout of discretion about which cases to bring which not to bring this state attorney has abuse that discretion as an effectively nullified certain laws in the state of florida the govrnor then appointed andrew ban a judge from the same judicial circuit to take worls place world can appeal her suspension to the republican controlled state senate or go to the florida supreme court unlikely that she a she is going to win that case she will be the new amasan b c hero of the day because that is the way that this works if you do not performing drob or if you disrupt the system a tennessy state legislator who just te sizes to lead a quasi riot into the middle of the tennessy state legislature then emason bes youwll make you a hero if then youar stript of certain legislative privileges here was the orlando state a torney depose a suggesting that don the big promm heres that the cobs gave to sant is the info ad that the copsire the problem becase the cops actiou went to the govenors offien out wele referring all the crimes o none of none them ar gtting proscude shup the cops are the badgies see where normal people come from the cops are the good guise in the criminals badgis i also want o point out that lin wortmin has plat in bi roll and civing the governor adthe a permain that hea ta wor to the por a te spension why well i'll tell you why becaus when i ran i prom a flon porthen a con of ilty andtin ti had te contae terney we croficuted tono then mill a terial terrorith on the cerribor community and he wen te tal under my administration and the flord o orda ple wit cat about it you hare the cors of uns an backran i can only assume a hr political allies it is wor of noting here that she let out of jail people who went on to commit violent crimes when its dat an veal a twenty eight yourold man killed by a lan of police officers saturday after he had shot n critically injured two other officers on friday night vil had posted bonned earlier thes yere after being charge with sexual battery of fourteen year old girldnas the cantiperson th world was letting out a prison the other case is involved a man who shot and kills his pregnin girl friend after having been released while facing charges including carrying a concealed fire amound school property and aman who is con victed f armed robbery in sentence to fifty one weeks in jail as ha youthful offender warrall then went on in this press conference to talk ba horonasensis was de strong democracy because democracy is where he get elected to a prosecution position and then refused to prosecute he needed to get acin ea intom cofide wa e e e wa i ra an he will have a coplish that to day he will be in i ias inti ase rine iwl a il anee itri a mockwi e n te tate of florida i' gat anza and then she continued by suggesting of course that d santis is what she called a week dictator which is weird since he just fires either he is a strong to tator who just iry toor a esa is e week eye did not fire you it is canno weird to be a a week dictator by the way she finished this press conference by em putting up her fist antifa power which has just a great way for a prosecutor to go y an yourte te laietur irn i in isl tere an ai tin by a we itaer antathat well i mean it did change that you are no longer the state prosecutor i'mean that there there is that sagan rondissans is doing the things in florida that are necessary for people in florida to live a a better life this the part of the desantis campagn that has been far kind of lacking is the fact that the sansis is actu very good and lek tee basics of governing in sate of florida meaning wen a bridge that is taken out by huricane thet thing is back up within days make ta highways work here the police are able to do their jobs here when a prosecutor fails to do her job she gets fired in the state of florida and that bred and butter kind of stuff is the reason that de sansi is very popular in the state of florida all of the fighting of wokaness all of the sort of controversial policy positions that de sansis has taken on top of that that that sort of the icing on the cake but te cake is that de sansis actu very god governing and this i something that re publican voters ought to think about going forward when a comes time to vote in primaries is is donal trump going to luarn the lessons of his first precidency and is he then going to be good at the bred an butter kind of stuff or 'is it just goin to be a repeat of the first presidency in which esshe did not do any the bred and butter kind of stuff whose can of te people around him doing all that and he istweated a lot because if you actually wish to see the left lose the thing that you actually need is for the rights to be good at the actual business of governing kno how to weeld power ineffective ways the sans is doing thensaid he is not the only one a bran camping in georgia is very good at at the effective use of power glen yon can in virginia seems to b using powerwell but the santis he is using it in a very powerful waight in the state o flora that is something again that sured factorin to how re publicans consider voting in a primary because it turns out being president is not just about what you say it is about what you are able to do and very often dol froms tefends to miss staffing his ad ministration is that he was betrayed well to great would not be betrayed is to staffor ad ministration properly in the first place in the way the u see fits either you think that trump learns and eusing te at betterer on the job the second time around or you have doubts we will get to more on this in just one second because disney is now paying the price for the woke cultural battles they

month of coveridge right now pure talk again wireless four americans by americans ogan meanwhile disney is taking it directly in the teeth the your times of courses attributing us to larger market forces but the reality is that disney has completely blown out a large sigment of its userbase and tiit disn'y s lost thousands of dollars from my family alone and normally and a given year i woul take my family to disney land over here it disney world over here and flortout take them there at least three times probably over the course of the year and i've fairly large family buth cousins in everything r talking thousands of dollars thet disney has lost just for my family nd i'veithere a massive bill moltime moltibillion dollar corporation but they'r lot people hor me theyr lot of people are not subscribing to disney plus youven tough i otherwise would just watch the starwors content because disney has decided to spit in the eye of it is consumer base and obvious that was highlighted by their conflict for no reason whatsoever with thi state of florida over the cluster of secual and doctrnation of children well now then your times reporting that rober igers urgenty to overhaul disney came in to sharp relief on wednesday disney' streaming operation lost on hut five hundred and twelve million dollars in the most recent quarter bringing total streaming losts is since twenty nineteen when disney pluss was introduced more than eleven billion dollars disney pluss lost roughly eleven point seven million subscribers world wide in the three months that ended you life first for new total of a hundred forty six point one million all the decline came from low price version of disney pluss and indias they basically inflated their numbers by getting a bunch people to sign up for you o the starer package in india and then everybody basically dropped off because disney lost to bige for n the expenseif rightes to indian for merely cricket match matches excluding dis in excluding india disney plus gained eight hundred thousand subscribers primarily over seeswithout rate of growth is not gloing to make up for the kind of closs that day have been experiencing due to strimming iger is now shifting the foks di disney plus away from brisk subscriber growth which requires those big markening campagns instead disney has been trying to make more money from disney plus subscribers at already has by increasing the prite another have te pric in creases on the way starting on october twelfth the ad free versional cost fourteen dollars poolo which is control by disin will begin charging eighteen buck for adfry actes that is up rom fifteen bucks as an incentive disne will begin selling a new strimming packege avvrey actes to both disney plus andhul for twentybuk month starting on suptember six now again one of the things that is happaning here is that a lot of prorspective customers people me have been dropping loff it is really lowering thei'r growth curve an elethern per cent in crease in profitability at disneys them pmark divisions despite weakness walt disney world an florda allowed the company to salvage the quarter to a degree but they are really gettin cloh and other teen park operators and florta have seen attendants de clines historically when butgers get tight familys cut back on expensive trips o dizey ubas onchus that again there is a political aspect to this and here is a thing a marginal move on a major company makes a big difference everybody assumes thet gian ciane companies run extraordinary profet margints and tat's not true it is not true the propet margins perticting the media business can be extremely slim and if you ding the profphet margin by a certaine per centage if you alienate a certain percentage of your quar customer base that has really outsides ramifications for the broader market be cause remember valuation when it comes to public markets is always a multiple of the actual cash flow or the actual ebit do of the company what that means is that if a company say has a a grost in come a that the growt they take in is a billion dollars year that company's not valued and a billion dollars on public markets can' get value to ten billion fifteen billion dollars on the public markets to pending on what industry n sector the company is in that means that if you ding that company by say fifty million dollars and it goes down from a billion to nine hundred fifty million if you do that than the multipole what say it is it a ten level is going to go down concominently at that fifty million is going tend up looking more five hundred million whn it comes to the actual market cap of the company to genactury seriously ding a company in the public markets simply by alienatig a certain segment of your customer bays and that is exactly what disney has done by getting into this bleep fight whet governor to santis the state of florda and more broadly parents across the country and te're only yn to get worse by the way mean the fact tha they are now doing woke snow white is upon know what their thinking over there or why they thing that is a growth area who are they catering to seriously are the carrings of the chinese market it used to be that disneys that the big rap agins disnes that they were cattring to the chinese market by filming mulan in chonchang and ignoring the slave labor of muslims and at least you culd make the case on a market level that they were trying to appeal to unote i the giant chinese market but when they are deciding to make woke snow white with non p dwarves as the dwarves who exactly are they appealing to is not the chinese market what is that clerer they doing and the answer is that they of been victims of institutional capture by their own people and i assume that as the markets starts to to clinewill tim by the economy momentarily that as the market starts tor clines susinens gon to have to do what every other company is doing an ther can t have to

slash appear to get start e this policy genius y com slash chipero o cam meanwhile again the economic lahes here are blinking rade things are not going to everyone is very saying when about the state of te economy i 'm significantly less sanguine about the state of the economy i know too many in vesters wo are holding their money in a bayins knowing that the economy is on raisers edge every one i talk to a in investment circles and i do a fair share of investing every one i'm talking to is holding their money out ofthe market right now because they do not know which way it is going togo well to day the consumer price indecks came out again and i it set it sowe that price is rose three point two per cents in july from a year ago junial recall ways down to three per cent which still fifty per cent higher then the fad seeks riht the fed once to two per cent reat of increase year on year that a sort of the milton freemen schicagos school idea that you if you if you constantly d in inflate toe currency and dfly value that if you do that it is going to spur a certain level of commy con sumer spendsing and it is going to keep the wheels churning and all the rest fits i'am sortvef of theenna school guy in in the sense that irn i should believe in two per cent in flation rades op by the fat i thing we should see a zero per cent in flacia rate from the fad and money should be worh what money was worth ten years ago or twenty years ago and we should stop in flating away people savings but call me a classisist the fact is that two per cent is what we have aimed at for years and years and years last month youare on youric commit at three per cents tay that is fiftyp that is a full fifty per cent higher now i know that our minds have now been warped by the fact that we hde ten per cent in flation for a while there thanks to supply chain thanks to covet and thanks you dro bidns in flationary monitary and fiscal policies but three per cent still way too high literally fifty per cent too high ospmust be to it is rate those lastma we are told those alsom well now it is three point two per cent you are on yore which means that the rate of increase continues to be too high an now the bringing down the rate of increase fror nine per cent but it still at three point two per cent which by my calculation is still more than fifty per cent too high hen a monthly baseis prices sticked up zure point to perscent between june anjuly economis say that the bump is linked two temporary factors including rebounding air line hotel and energy prices they are not likely to a rode long or term progress but iare not that means at rode longer where otkon n jrun back up to seven per cent but are we etting back down to two per cent the over all mumber was also higher because prices are being compared at the rates of in crease last july the first month when inflation began to fall after a long climbeat again that its still a price increase again if the curve looks sort of this that does not mean tha here it somehow lower than here that is not correct if for those who cants hat i'm doing my hand here es sentiually i'm drawing a curve thet the verbian looks very steep and then sarch to shallow out but is still increasing weare now at the shallowed olt but still increasing rate of inflation in the united states and at' still again fifty percent too high puchjose ru rom a ous aeconomis to barplaces in the grand scheme we are seeing distinflation and things are moving inthe retsurrection if you look pass the volital categories underling lamentum has not change however ire re back to where we need to be obviously nit tthis is spurring talk that thefederal reserve is basily going to try to hold out here tand not increase the interestrates again but i do not see evidence that the rate is dropping down to two per cent without any further action by the federal reserve and this is wy it seems the stock market is really voli or riht nous can in going up it is going down is can a stick in around the same generalize level the reason for that is deep uncertainty about the inimpact of the policies thet are being pursued right now again when when you look at over all measurers of economic helth wht you are seeing is business disinvestment you are seen mortgage lending dry up you are seeing those those rates of intrest on new mortgages go way way way up and eventually eventually when people start losing jobs because the money dries up thaet's can be a lot people hos star defaulting on tats and whn the start tyfaulting on tat's banks are gon to take to head and wen those banks are in vest in bonds that is going to have some pretty significant bleed over effects wir he broader economy if silkan vallybank invested too heavily in government bonds and low interest bearing rates and then they got blown out begas the higher interest racte that the federal government was offering on its neo bonds but that is cause the margins interens bonds where two they tacumany bonds in their perfolio well as banks actually start to experience significant default then those bondstha they have in ther partfulergonalic worse and worse right now thei'r operating we will see how that works out for them meanwhile jobidns out they are still tout and by anomics as thogh to big wind despite fact the americanople really really hate by anomics wi getst

strength this guy is a terrible president he is horrible at his job he wanders into the ocean he is this a person who can barely stand upright and not only that he happens to be deeply corrupt as will get to in a moment any terrible person to boot and re publicans cannot run they cannot fighd anybody who will be this guy regularly in poles i got's kind of amazing to me and shows the the state of

number one of having a crack addicted son would be jon't give him access to the credicard because he is a dictid to crack i knothice is really complex but it does not seem all tat complex actually it is it is absolutely insane to me that jobidnt gets away with the it is all about the family routine when pretty clearly dued benefited and i'm just wondering how he did not benefit at this points according to the ne yrik post jonathan turly he points out that of course jobbidnt benefited from all of hunters foremn business dealings how could he not he says the president's denial of any knowlege of is sons form business dealing to finily been exposed as e toda lye the final line of defence is now that hunter byne was selling access to joe but it was an illusion but there is nothing a loser about tends to millions moving to hunter and other family members also all these clams ignort e mails discussing the fact that hunter and his father used join to counts to pay for expenses including how one account was used to pay joe's taxes there is hunter's complaint that hewas using half his urnings to support dad one trusted off behin informant said in planning a bribe one form figure is told to avoid direct payments to joe to day that is is amateurish as a an envelope of cash on byne to busin the business of influence peddling for decades apparently if hundrd gets luctury cars and millings o dollars an twenty millin dollars goes in the entire family bank account joe did not benefit or receive a bribe apparently only if mony went directly in to his bank account would that actually amount to it that that is acturly the white houses defense o this point believe ofre not that is right tha is what theyre saing now we also know that jobidon y is apparently worth an estimated eight million dollars at this point and that he eare not seventeen pwen three million knolledge over the four years he was out of office how is how is in riching all of your family members not a form al bribery i'm just wondering if if i went if some ony came to me though i want to pay you to say untruth truly untrue things hon your show that you do not actually believe i want to pay you to do that the wemento pays i'm put your kit is trust fon is that not if what a ment mac its are young even if they were of majority with that nopy a form of bribery i'm justcn i'm confuses to how it is not the white house is resting it is it is notice how the gold post ed now as we say been pun ted into the ocean the golpost wore hunter did nothing wrong then it was jo did not know that hunter done anything wrong then it was well joe may have known that hunter did something wong body wasn'n involved then was woll jo might have ben invalved but no money directly went into his personal wallet in his back pockets i mean you have moved pretty dramatically here i noticed to the white house put out amemmo setting their final bull postpot to day house re publicans on the overs ike commitee released another memo full of years old news in you endoin missirection but notably missing get again as any connection to present an bidon well but i mean there is he was on the fon calvs he was taking hunter his drug adold derrolick of a son one most immoral people in american public life on a plain with him to china to closed deals what the hell says the white house house re publicans can proove presen in bidant did anything wrong but there proving every day they ave no visio and no whacended actually help the american people i kay all of this is tire some and ridiculous in the extreme everyone knows it and i and it is not going to play in the selection cycleats just not going to playn thselection cycl especialy given te fact the american people do not i shul believe the jobidon is

basis as his electin campaign in twenty twenty whih is his high charac ter and great level of care for the american people he is just a man who hares about you youremember this was the big pitchon twenty twenty this a man his experience pain and because he is experience paintin his life he understands your paine as a really weak buill clinton tiht pitch but it one because again downs from is not somebody who tends to feel pain at least not on his surface the truth is that trump when comes sort of th common man actually does feel lot more for tose people in jobidon does without a dout but that was bidon's pitch that all disappered with that canistand yesterday the state department continued double down on the idea that yobiton had done stellar job in afgannistan here is the state department spokes person mathy miller saying that actually was a phe nomenal choice to leave afcanistand in the way we did respect the decision making that when into tha with draw from hav canistan that is something that wes spoken to a number of tis but what abouit goe ye still believe that this is not this i as tefa beis they have a real hard time when the innastration callin is tetrallis tato still believe it was ganly thet as the corect cosfy tous but wan tat o that o we leveas a cra casin toise but again i would never want a quible with a fam nember who i ses fir ses and enormous trasity then i think it on that wated a men we on tem e on to some of som e a oh it i'm not con iblat the found member tot wan her out the family omn mork gn movon muman on smumanon bokprison also said that s actualytheyve ben in credibly transparent about howt all of this when tdown which is weird since they have not ithink tht you tu til your obbeyation or your o mi is yo i tin trans parent obot i believe we have been in chanly transparent about the actions this department has taken a but with respect to to request from the committee as seen a number of equest comen i know we have been in discussions with them but i now i doft want a charac terize thos a give thaat i av just not i de justtos sir were conison recess ran now cussion of o is low down ori sas si do not wnt a comlinim in on detail wo wo i on't talk for a second about transparency and about the fact that no one trusts the government riht owt because not only s thegovernment not transparent with you but the media whore supposedto be the watch dog are not transparent with you long as he democrat is in the oval office if it em crid is in the oval office they'are not transparent with you if republican is in the ovel office not only are they not transparent with you about the republican they are fully non transparent about all investigations into the republican when did all of this happen it is impossible to think that tere was not a ground shift in theway americans think about their institutions that was coincident withthe risobrockoboma i've talked about this a little bit over the course the past week ire's a massively importat interview over at tablet magazine which is a great website that is worsh the reed they did not interview with a the historian ame david garrow who wrote a p litur prizewenng biography of martnluther kang and then in twenty seventeen he had a ba biography of barokobama in his earliears andit was alled rising stars by all right to tripben a massive hit this o this book because it actully uncovered a bunch of stuff about abama the themmedia never would ave covered for example the fact that in dreams from my father whih is almost entirely fectionalized apparently accorig todivgarro that when barokabam rote his first memoir dreams for my father he has an incident where he broke up with a white girl friends susppote supposedly because she couln't understand why he want to get in touch with hi black identity and what actually happened is that she broke up with him because he was covering for ravhing black antitemites that is what david garrl un covered media never checked in to it they never found the girl friend they never dog into anything remotely related to barokabama by the way other revelations included in this book where actual hand written letters from barokobama to one of his girel friends talking about his and is a direct quote repeatedly fanticizing about making love to men and ming that the pretty bomshell kind of stuff no im pretty wild and selatious none of it received virtually any coverage at the time but why and the anser is because the media wen barokobama rose to the presidency and as he made that rise the media decided that they were now the actual protorian guard the're always by us to the left but there is certainly certain a level of base line honesty that required them o still report on things and then barokabama rose to level of te presidency and every institution was weaponized on behalf of this man personally that is actually wat happen the entire commedic institutional structure for example said it is forbidden to make jokes about abama you cannot make jokes about this absolutely self obsessed ridiculous man because he is actually amesiana figure you remember the crisrock said that he is the country's dad this is this the kind of comedy out encertainment out they wr all worshippng at the altar the media out and oure public institutions also started reflecting everything with regard to obama david tamuels of tablet whose interviewing garro e said rising star highlights a remarkable lack of curiosity on the part of mainstream reporters an institutions about a man who almost instantaneously was treated less a politician and more the idol of an inter e lead cult and it is true the entire teck world revolved around barokobama he became the center of the political universe everybody thinks the centr of the political universe is donal trumpet that is not actually right the center of the political universe sincs too thousandate has been barokobama donal trump is a reaction to barokobama jobidon is reaction to donal trump and happens to be the third turm of barokobama since every person in position of major staffing power is a barokabama akalite barokabam by the way still resides most of the urnwashington to cee and its amazing to me that nobody's actually attempted to track down how much does barokabama actually talk with all the people who used to work with him and shape policy inside the bidon administration and again the corruption of all of our institutions rom the back of barokabamas personal self obsession is truly an amazing thing sa david garrofs biographermobama he says in this interview quote he has no interest in building the democratic party is an instit ution i think that is obvious it only he had any truly deep meaningful policy commetments other than the need to feel in to be perceived as victorious as triumphant but because all the institutions went into defendobomamote that has carried forward to jobidon and here is a thing they could get away with it when it actually was when it actually was barokabomic is barokamma had this sort of messianic quality to him at he was actully a really good speaker he was actually a celebrity type but jobidon is not and as that mask has stripped away and as the media have just been demonstrably proved to be members of that interly calt of course faith in then has absolutely plumeted and of course the country is polarized because the institutions tht at least ued to have sort of a baseline goll and purpose they had o fill even of theirs political biic involve every one distrust those institutions now and for absolutely good reason an what that also means tit is very easy when an institution fails to immediately attribute it to this sort of interly called status is it failure or is it malice i've sod many times that i tried to attribute as much ca in stupidity rather than malice but the problem is when malice has been pursued over and over and over again against to proticular point of view at a certain point you start to see that may be it is not stupidity may be it is malice does 't mean all thits malice but it means i's easy to over a tribute two malice rather thantustupidity which leads to further political polarization and that seems to be what is been happening all over the place institutionally speaking in the united states to really grave effect by the way because what it means that each side is now bouncing off the other republicans are reacting to to anything democrats say by saying that if democratate it we must lof it which is a bad idea and democrats are reacting t anything the republican say by saying that if republicans it we must hate it all of that was created by the barokoboma era this is not donal trumpser that is still barokubon azeur woere just living in the aftermauth of that era as i've said man times about dona trump people save that he killed american politics destroyed american put donal trump was not the murderer barokobomal was the murder donal trump is the coroner who stumbled on the body and declarted dead o can meanwhile we are still experienceing fall out from this ohio vote there is a vote in ohio to essentually changed the state constitution to enshrine amendment to thestate constitution to require more than a sixty per cent a proval to change to state constitution that was meant to prevent a a sort of walk back with regard to abortion law on behalf of those who are probortion insteate of ohio that measure failed pretty dramatically and once again this demonstrates that republicans have to pursue victory incrementally very often thet is that this tendency tit to feel he s got a gofor broke all the time going for broke is probably not going to be a successful is enemy successful tactic what is hilarious is the democrats of course are about to blow it the democrats have decided that actually this demodal for trans issues their bunch of articles today suggesting that democrats look at what happened in ohio which was the rejection of what effectively was sort of apro life ballad initiative they look at that thy say whall this means that suddenly the people of ohir a socially left wing no i means there is a status quobius and it means that whenever there is a muscular attempt two in shrine in state waw of you a reughferendam more prolife positions people do not it becase there status quobias and for going to do it you have to do it gradually yoeefve to do it over time but both sides because that pollerisation there no longer seeking radual youther have new york which is seeking to legalize abortion an s you areghty five years old or you have people on the right fare seeking to ban all abortion in the tate no obvis the have lot of sympathy for that second position that is the position that i hold but it is not going to work if you can's actually wind o victory is a necessity here and publicans should be smart about how they pursue it o cae time for some things i and then some things that i hate things that i to day there is this crazy case in stockdtin california whe're two stocktan seven eleven clerks a tacked to would be thief with sticks vidia of that july twenty ninth assault as gain national attention it is a five minute clep this guy is emptying shells of cigaretts an other product just into a bag as you about to steal it and oneof the clerks pins the man down another beats him with a pole to which i say yes more of this stockt an police said they were investigating what police calle to suspected assault and suspected robberies at the seven eleven heares what the tape look beating seene in this now fiveral vidio is under investigation five thatstockton police department na more than five minute clip shows at here is this emptying ss thisn teerman pers oan stockton seve an on a sthtealing wor he il tropering a ca into trashano ti ands go an store clerk stepping in then stor ler saing no quoted avnoth that and tha that gas going to town im what do deserved it good on the stockon clerks hones to god i'm tired of this nonsensewhere wou have to pretend sensitivity for people hor stealing product and walking out of stores of trashbacgs filled with stolen product you beserved to get your askict and a that this a this store clerk who gives him a beating a few more beatings this n there will be a lot less thevery and in places stockton the the pathetic fact of corse is that now it is now it is seen is normalas to steal that it used to be when i was again that if some e's gon a shoplifs was a pack of gum in your pocket and now there is walking with giant trashbags and filling them up with things and walking out get's the prices right or something it is wild a good for the toreclerks there not conto be charge d as they as they shuld not baby caus of coursethat is ridiculous o gae time for a rare things i li gives a very very very rare thing i you ready i'm into say the tobine is doing a correcting now for those who sad never say the ybine is done a correcting tobin is doing a correcting here isthe thing the yobine is doing that is correct he signs an executive order on wednesday aimes at curbing the flow of american investment an management no how into a limited range of chinese firms the administration fears could fuel beshanes at military ambitions it is an initial step thatwill not take affect until next year but it is a signal to chinas leadership that washington is going to continue to impose restrictions on bashing's access two critical tecnology that is not fact necessary tri na is building up it is military they are seeking more and more sophisticated mikro cheps and superconductors in order to build up that military for possible take over of tiwan chinese officials are mat which is always good indicateor that action were doing something right the use habitually politicized is tack and trait issues and uses them as a tool and weapon in the name of national security said chinese abs yo spokesman lou panuin a statement to the washington post but chinahawks on both sides of the isle im ar i'm thay they say the proposal while good does not go far enough the praise is qualified in the sense that i greew it dos obviously is a very very limited step by the by dan ad ministration by it as they step in the right direction mik mc caul re publican of texas says the administration scaling bat at a timewhen a gress ove action is needed more than ever continues the trend of a peasing industry the cost of national security but again the fact that binan is doing anything at all is better than nothing i suppose he con see is glasshave full lass half empty i choose at this point to see at least this as as somewhat lass quarter fal sohts put it tout wiou cate time for a thing that i hate our harts gots everybody in laheina malley to day just horrifying apparently death told from fast moving wild fires has now increased to thirty six malaccount the official sent on wednesday night the blaze have been raging across at lest three of wise islands because of strong winds linked to hurricane dora a a a bunch of sort of historic stuff on malley got destroyed lahinah which is one of tos beautiful place is in all america is wit was utterly ravage my my wife an i ue to vacation amaly pretty regularly with thekids and ta laheinoe was the stop it was the place that you went ona on a beautiful evening to go shoppingsto series of shoplic ice cream stores and juwelery stores and art stores ans really fun and really cooky and i and it was basely burne to the grounds is truly yo a horrifying situation eleven thousand people ware evacuated from malley on wednesday alone ofm all that is terrible a there there are a bunch of links to places that you can go to help people who have beneffected by the wild fires ranging from the american red cross o the maly relief fun people should o go and give general sly because that is a terrible situation oke time for our latest episode of deconstructing the culture this is where i go viral for pointing out that pop culture absolutely blows in his terrible for you let us do it todays deconstructing t culture comes courtesy of doja cat givein name obviously she came outof her mother her mother sa i shall call this one doja cats and i'll be honest i have no idea what dochacats background is im i do not know why this person is famous because she does not seem to be a particularly talented human but apparently she is perceived is talented by our unwa ar vast onwash the same people whohave made barbea billiont omoy and a docha cat apparently she gained her stage name from one of her cas as wellas her favoritestrin of marowana i jus look hat up right now i'm bats definitely away to name yourself is after one of your cats who is apparently name was was cat and also your favorite strain of mariwana obviously that is that is solid style that that is dat's just fan frecantastic i'm i'm doga cat i has now put out a song title paint the town red the left in culture has gone far now that there there is literally no place left to go excepto just get directly in bed with satan and this become kind of the common meam these days used to be a little more subtle right honestly when you are talking about madonna in the early edies is subtle that is how far we have come madon the earlyly ady's writhing around wearing catholic immagery he is doing the kan of doing the kind of saint sinter routine that was that was considered brazen then now it is the hight of subtlety because how little mass axs having secs with satan having gaysecs with satan in his vidios or you have sam smith dressing up as fat ugly satan well doing a routine with a man who says that he is woman and now we have doga cat who is jumped in on this just open satanic emmagery satan apparently is now the good satan is great satan is great i ga well i g i i gess i'm glader thang the clab hart out loud here it is paint the town red by a woman who named herself after her cat and a mariwana strain yes folks the're used to be a western civilization herigo ca na shies dres a assatin nakad lie prekiin fren and now he shas dressd in a lat out ta an re i an as in an an san id ony now es lik cares sang el looks in wear tan now she is having sa it anotheriman thats that ra wet av anot thas lik ly sim er halien realien en preig ilan an as is cutting thean tilof e cors geralian i'm i i do not know what is suppose we happening here other than it is kind of horrifying and and terrible i the lyrics for this which i will now read for purposes of media matters they can clip it out of context nan claim that i'm trying to a rap the song i supposed to synically reading the song i nomina read the lyrics to a this piece of crap and i'm going to point out how bather sis by juck supposing it with on of the great pieces of music ever written that you can tell kind of how we have declined here because obviously this is great art we have been told that this is great art because people apparently this i do not know why but then again i nunt understand the taste of the american people obviously because i mean who would not love a song featuring a woman dressed in nothing but body pain bald wearing devile horns and cutting the q the umbilical cord of an alien creature whowould not would not love the here are the lyrics to paint the town red to the strains of box first brandenburg concherito let us do this thing walk on by walk on by walk on by walk on by yab h i said what i said i'd rather be famous instead i let all that get to my head i do not care i paint the town rad i said what i said i'd rather be famous instead i let all that get to my head i do not care i paint the town rad she the devil shea bad well she a revil she put her foot to the pettl it will take a whole lot for me to settl she the devil also send my happiness is all of your misery i put good in all my kidneys i'll kangns appenis im yah i mean i do not see what is bad about this what is vatso bach used to write music as a tribute to god an that that is literally why hourite music he was a church organist and you would write his music with an eye toward te divine and's o that is the result and even batoben who is much more of a secularist in his religious outlook wrote with an eye toward sort of a secular acumanist aversion of a higher morality that is what the the od to joy is at the end of the ninth symphony broms whose music i love was essentially a secular humanist but very religiously tolerant none of them would have said who ise great the devil o of the evil it turns out when you worship the devil and when you worship the pagan the place you went up is here now when satanists start creating actual art that beautifies the world and makes the world better place maybe'll start taking their philosophy a little seriously why because it turns out that the products of of philosophy very often are tide to thephilosophy itself but it makes my argment super easy that ar satanic pagan current pop culture is garbage when what they produce is actual shlike that is it makes my argment superso th i i appreciate you doing that i apprecit you maken mhe argment supereasy's rand you have to make the argmamore i'l have to do a you show clips of doja caty person who named herself once again after a cat and a marilonostrane dressed up as satan and rapping that garbage that is all i have to do you made my argmen for me i appreciate it already goit is the rest the sho continues right now you are not

welcome to the huberman lanconcas a science sciencepace to fori i mandruhuberman and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine my guest to day is doctor shawn mackie doctor shawn mackie is a medical doctor that is he treats patience as well as a p ht meaning he runs a laboratory he is the chief of the division of pain medicine and a professor of both enasteseology and neurology at stamford university school of medicine to day we discuss what is pain most of us are familiar with the notion of pain from having a physical injury or some sort of chronic pain or a headache to day doctor mackie makes clear what the origins of pain are both in the nervous system and outside the nervous system that is the interactions between the brain and the body that give rise to the thing that we call pain indeed we discuss the critical link between physical pain and emotional pain and how altering one's perception of emotional or physical pain can often change the other we lso discuss some of the changes in the nervous system that occur when we experience pain and how that can give rise to chronic pain we also of course cover different methods to reduce pain safely and those methods include behavioral tools psychological tools neutrition supplementation and of course prescription drugs we discuss the intimate relationship between temperature that is heat and cold and pain and pain relief if youre interested in the use of heat or cold to mogulate pain that conversation ought to be of interest as well we also touch on some highly controversial topics such as opioids opioids are a substance that your body naturally makes but of course many people are familiar with exogeniusts opioids that is opoids that are available as drugs and the called opioid crisis doctor mackie makes very clear which specific clinical circumstances warrant the use of exogion is opioids with of course a warning about their potent addicted potential and we get into a bit of discussion about wer the opioid crisis and the use of opioid drugs to control pain is and is going before we begin i emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desiron effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i the thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is aero press aero press is similar to a french press for making tofy but is in fact a much better way to make coffee the aeropress was developed by allan adler whis an engineer at stamfort i knew of allen because i used to see im in my hometown of palowalto test flying the called aroby frisby he was sort of famous suround my town as this brilliant engineer that would create these unusual products when i heard about the aro press i got it i tried it and i absolutely loved it because it does indeed create the best tasting cup of coffee or loose sleef t with aeropress you can brew an incredible tasting coffeeour te and clean up the whole process in less than two minutes the key thing to know about the aero press is that it is not just some trivial variation on the french press that shorten brewing time that the aeropress uses really changes the flavor of your cup of coffee or t it makes it exceptionally smooth if you would to try aero press you can go to aero press dot com slash huberman that is e e r o p r e s s doc com slash huberman to get twenty per cent off any aropress coffee maker aero press ships anywhere in the u ssa canada and over sixty other countries around the world again that is aero press dot com slash huberman to get twenty per cent off to day's episode is also brought to us by levels levels is a program that lets you see how different foods inactivities impacts your blood glucost levels using a continuous glucos monitor one of the most important factors impacting your energy levels as well as your immediate and long turm health are your blood glucost levels sometimes refer to as your blood sugar levels to maintain mental and physical energy and focus you want your blood glucos levels to be relatively stable throughout the day levels makes it extremely easy to determine how specific foods and food comminations meal timing exercise and sleep work alone and incommination to impact your blood glucos levels i start to using levels about two years ago and find it to be immensely beneficial it is help me better arrange what i eat when i eat when to exercise nd my sleep patterns if youre interested in learning more about levels and trying a c g m yourself go to levels dot link slash huberman levels his launch a new c gium censer that is smaller and has even better tracting than the previous versions right now they are also offering an additional two free months of membership again that is levels dot link elli n k slash huberman to day's episode is also brought to us by better help better help offers professional therapy with a license therapis carried out on line i've been going to therapy for well over thirty years initially i did not have a choice it was a condition of being allowed to stay in school but pretty soon i realize that therapy is extremely valuable in fact i consider doing regular therapy just as important as getting regular exercise inclin cardivascular exercise ind resistance training which of course i also do every week the reason i know therapy is valuable is that if you can find a therapists with whom you can develop ae really good report you not only get terrific support for some of the challenges in your life but you also can derive tremendous insights from that therapy insites that can allow you to better not just your emotional life in your relationship life but of course also the relationship to yourself nd to your professional life to all sorts of carreer goals in fact i see therapy is one of the key components for meshing together all aspects of one's life and being able to really direct one's focus and attention toward what really matters with better help they make it extremely easy to find a therapists that is ideal for your needs your life circumstances and that can match to your s gadual in a very convenient way if you would to try better help go to better help doct calm slash huberman to get ten per sent off your first month again that is better help doct calm slash hubermen and now for my discussion with doctor shawn mackie doctor mackie welcome oh it is a pleasure to be here thank you this is a long time coming we are colleagues at stamford and i'm familiar with your work but to day we are going to take a pretty broad and deep survey of this thing called pain it is all to start off very simply than ask what is pain pain is this complex and subjective experience that serves a crutial role for all of us to keep us away from injury or harm it is both a sensory and an emotional experience and i think that gets lost on people that includes o sememotional component to it and it is incredibly individual and we will get more into that hopely as time goes by that your pain is different from my pain and is different from everybody else's it takes an incredible tol on society when it goes chronic when it becomes persistent to the tune of about a hundred million americans and aat last count about a half a trillian dollars a year and medical expense's of an astounding problem were facing in society ind one that is only getting worse and i'm hoping during the course of this discussion that we can kind of break down a little bit of the foundation of pain and kind of build it back up because unfortunately i in society there is a lot of misunderstanding about what pain is and i think i hopefully we can build that foundation and then layer on some some useful treatments and you suall options for people i'm glad you pointed out this link between the censory in the emotional experience every ones in a while i'll pull some thing or i'll have i yu lican kink my nack or my back and fortunately for me it resulls pretty quickly but i notice that when i'm experiencing that kind of pain that i become slightly more irritable perhaps much more irritable to pentiyg on whom you ask and that everything becomes more challenging thinking is harder sleeping is harder concentrating on anything besides pent it is it is a i'm it is as if something is nagging from the inside and that raises the the next quession that i have which is its pain something that is in our brain in our body we are both it is clearly in our brain and can i take a moment to can a lay a little foundation for some of that to help clear up some of the mystery of pain we know that pain most pain all starts with some stimulus whether be that kinkin your nack or your shoulder from working out or turning the wrong way and what is going on there i in your body is not pain what is g oing on is that a there are censors in our skin or softissue are deep tissues called no susceptors and these nosuscepters are censing elements and they send different types of stimuli they can sense temperature a heat cold they sense pressure they can sense p h changes due to for instance inflammation that may occur from a any something going on in your neck your shoulder those sense signals up ner fibre types and the two that we we refer to ore adelt and sea fibres one transmits very fast it is responsible that sharp jolt o pain that goes to your brain when we are step on a tack ar put our hand on a hot stove and there is another fibri call to sea fibre which is much slower in responsible for that dull achy pain now these signals they go to the spinal cord li up and down r a from our head down to ar or back and there their shaped their changed a little bit they then are sent up to the brain and it is whence they hit the brain and they converge with this magical mystery set of nerves in the brain that it becomes the experience of pain and if there is one key message i'd to get to the audience is that what goes on out here what goes on in your shoulder in your neck is not pain that is no susception those are electrical signal's electric chemical impulseis being transmitted and that is to be distinguished from what becomes the subjective experience of pain that you have and why it is critical is that or brain serves many functions of emotions cognitions a memory action all of that shapes those signals coming in from our body to create your unique experience of pain that is different from everybody else's and i think that is important to note because we are frequently left with this notion of this one to one concordance between the stimulus and the experience of pain renay decart that french a philosopher think seventeen century an was the one who first postulated this idea of this direct linkage between the body and or actions and the stimulus in the response and it is wrong and unfortunate even in medical care we have this biomedical model that still is perpetuating this idea of a one to one relationship and that is a critically important point to get across in large part because frequently is humans we tend to project on to others our own experiences of pain and when we see somebody who is got an injury or something else going on we immediately put that on them and that has also been a problem ih with many people suffering ind chronic pain which is often viewed is the invisible disease son you say we put that on them you mean when somebody reports being in pain we have a hard time understanding what there oure experiencing because it is going to be very different in the way that we experience pain conversely of somebody is in pain they tend to assume that people oure experiencing pain the way that they are is do i hve that right you have a perfectly right and it actually if i can build on that gets worse because sometimes you have conditions fibro mialga that maybe we will get into where outwardly visibly you do not see anything wrong we are used to thinking of pain as a fractured yun a bone as aa swollen ankle we see that and then we oke well you have got pain you got legitimate pain whereas this invisible disease of chronic pain frequently you do not have something outwardly that you are seein but we bring in our own history of pain and we put that on other people ihave a question that somewhat mechanistic but we will keep it accessible to anybody regardless of their background you mention the nocicepters are in the body and everywhere in the body and on the surface of the body be able to detect certain kinds of stimule and then those signals are sent up into the brain and the brain creates thi subjective experience at we call pain is there a dedicated said of areas in the brain that are something akin tolike a pain pathway and the reason iaskus is that for for vision for hearing for touch we probably all experience though somewhat differently your perception of read is probably we will different in my perception of read we do not know for sure havit experiment support that idea but there is a major difference between people experiencing the same thing differently according to a mysterience mechanism in the brain as supposed it a an are an the brain that we can look and saylic halic lk that is where pain is a represented that is where all these these in puts from the body are put together to create this thing that we call pain a is there an area of the the thalemis a structure in the middle of the brain that takes in coming censory informationthat we could say oh that is the pain pathway is our part of our neal cortexs the outer shell of the the brain more less a beneath the skull but none the less on the outer portion of the human brain thatg we could say o tat's where pain exists or is it a distributed phenomena yet that is a great question and ecause we would all love at there was a pain centre in the brain that we could just go knock out but it is not that simple and in part because pain is such a conserved phenomenon it it is there it is wonderful because it is terrible anless it goes wrong but when you knock out one pathway going to the brain there is others there that well carry that system forward and you will still experience pain and it is they are to keep us all alive now to get to your point no there is not one pain brain area it is thought to be more of a distributed network of different brain systems we at one point time called at the pain matrics which represented areas such as a the insolor quartex the singular quartex the emigdala a number these brain regions at all subserve different functions were moving away from that because it seems every year or we pick up another region of the brain that is contributing to this network that subserves some additional functions some new onts to layer to it that is said we have been able to identify some common signatures common brain networks that seem to represent the experience of pain and this is where the development of brain based bia markers is commen and this is some of the work that i've done starting gash well over a dozen years ago and aothers have been a building on and what were finding is that there does seem to be this this conserved region sead of a distributed regions that do represent the experience of pain when somebody takes a called pain killer let let us take a a typical over the counter pain killer a i be prophin or seeto meniphan to a lessen pain of some kind where is that drug or drugs acting is it in the body oris it at the level of the brain we are both ye and this is where some of the challenges we get into ith language because technically endseids nonstrodal antine flamatory drugs ibew prophin a naperson there actually not anal jesics they are not technically pain killers an anal jesac is the descriptor for a courdin't qo pain killer yeither that would be more creck an opioid would be would fit into that category the ends saids are antine flamatory drugs there also there is another this is a technical term their anti hyper algesic drugs and one of the things that happens after in injury is that we get sensitization of the area that is injured and it is a beautiful thing because it sends a message to us to protect it i'm what the ends heads do as they reduce some of that sensitization out in the peripery and then backen the spinal cordon in the brain but they do not actually for instance i was going tay try this at home but probably not you can a in a normal situation hit your hand with the fork measure the amount of pain i'll go take and endsheid i be prophan if you hit your hand with that same fork there will be no difference folks please do not do do not do that at home place we are ar wit you are anywhereor anywhere for that matter but you are describing pain and he local inflammation response and the hyperel gesia the increasin pain in that general area as something very adaptiv very important it raises the question what is the threshold for saying that somebody should treat their pain reduced their pain i mean any time i've done a surgeries own animals which i do not do any more in the laboratory but we used to you would give them pain killers post operatively i've had surgeries beforehad pain killers post operatively although i do not taking the money the way they make my brain feel in a but we of course know that if you increase the dose of any pain medication too much than that animal or a human can petentially injure themselves worse or not protect that injured area it raises a hall set of sort of medical ethical but also just purely by logical questions how do you set the threshold for yes blunt pain verses no allow the pain to be there is an adaptive way of protecting yourself and healing presumely the inflammation is part of the healing process to and as you mention before pain is subjective and it is different between all of us i 'mand how do we decide whether not it is a good or bad idea to blunt that pain i think the the the threshold is when its impacting your quality of life in your bility to take care of the octivities of daily living engage with family friends go to work and that that serves kind of a your your threshold for whether to reasonable to to take a medication or not lot o controversy in the space right now used to be we all recommended just andsaids for any type of acute injury i do proma is a nonsteroid anti inflamatory drugs in te could we may be list off a few of those i mention i be profinacy to menifin sometimes referred to is youn the classic advilletilan all went throughout name brans there but what are some others in a proxin the proxin is another one trdoll ar cutarolac is another one the two over the counter and saids the protetypical over the counter once or ibeprophan an naprisen those the ones you can by over the counter without a prescription a tylon all actually has a slightly different mechanism of injury but still fits in that same general class it tends to be more centrally octing i bea tilan all our seet o meniphan but take me t escentially you mean brran brank e thank and rend a is asperan considered in ends that i do not yot owudan was fit into that category of basically a cox a cycheloxygenas and hibitor this is one of the the chemical mediators it gets release during injury and that chemical a substance has a tendency to wind up or amplify the nosusceptors that after an injury you knote that you are more sensitive there after a sunburn you and of having more sensisation that is what we refer to as periferal sensitization because o 's out in the perifery were winding up or amplifying the response a asperan and hads in general will reduce that inflammation their anti am hi peral jesic and a pardon again the jargany terms that we use i weavereg om e prolong as we go but but to your point you do not want to for instance let us imagine you have a fractured anle you do not want to be reaching for a very potent opioid just that you can continue walking on a fractured ankle that you have not gottn valuated by a clinition and perhaps casted that would not be sac those are rather extreme examples we get into those debates right and professional sports where they they send the person back out on the field with a broken bone having a given them a inejection or something i'm hoping that does not go on any more but a i'm sure it goes on oh there is all sorts of other things i get contact all the time professional teams in athletes asking hw they can get back an quicker nowdays the big thing or these a peptides that can certainly accelerate healing people travelling out of country get stemsell injections oh with o with a very few randomize control trials but i assure you that am cortsidon in the locker room mainly in the locker room their corticosteir own injections their payin killer injections hemeng it is it is not play at any expense but it is not far from that yet well when you are you are making millions of dollars a year and i i get the being back on the field but for the rest of us mere mortals i'm i think that is where we would want to draw line get medical attention if you have got an acute injury going a litle but deeper into mechanism because i think it is gon a service well now and going forward you mention the en sads and am this a seeowax cok is one is at is it in the family a prostaglin we talk about prostaglind ans because i think there are lot of people nowdays we hear about inflammation now you inflammations bad inflammations bab but one of the things that we talk about a lot on tis upodcast is the fact that o court is all is not bad inflammation is not bad nthese things serve a an important byological rolls the prostagland an seem to be one of the mainways that are a mean system a response to a physical or chemical injury and and creates inflammation and that as you said that inflammation sensitizeas in area makes it literally more sensitive and then we introduce these drugs that am to restored normal functioning and living could we establish what normal functioning is i man for instance if we make this really concrete could we say well if you can sleep fall sleep at night and stay asleep or perhaps go back sleep after you have woken up in mill the night than well you heal during sleep and take as little pain killers possible but enough that still lets you sleep well at night is that its sort of normal functioning because iyou are have a kink in my neck i do not want do much of anything i try but it is really frustrating what is it as a physicion how and as a pation how do we determine normal function ye and you are getting in to the new ance the complexity of this problem because we have been talking about end saids the ibrew provence a napperisins and as i said early anways to just give these out all the time but then the research comes out and shows that by blocking inflammation by blocking that wee may be blocking the normal healing process and we have seen delays in fracture repair we have been seeing delays and tissue repair and now you have got on one hand a medication that may help with pain help you in pro function you have got on the other hand something you are taking that mad delay the process where do you draw the line as a physician my approach it is really basically what you said it is balancing the fact that if you are not sleeping at night you are not in a heal and you are not kin to be able to do what you need to do the next day and if taking an end said helps you sleep and helps you i engage with what you need to do take it at the lowest dotes that you can get away with i've heard before that and sad should be taken no more than once every six hours peoplealternate different types of vend sagand three hours that is usually to try and reduce fever and other situation where an adaptive response fever people go out of their way to blockit read prevent the rain from cooking but again opens up the same set of issues and i'm wondering if somebody has some pain that makes be n o moving about frustrating in it is and it is difficult but they can sleep at night reasonably well may be not as well as they normally do would you are suggestion to that person if their goal is to heal as quickly as possible to just not take anything yet we have got a lot more data on the benefits of end saids this class of medication reducing pain thand we have data on showing the bad consequences of it and we are still needing more date on the whole healing message i think that a lot of the orthopetic surgeons out there prefer people not to be on end seds afterefor insince a total hip replacement a total ne replace because i think that is pretty clear but that is not what we are talking about right now one of the other interesting things about end saids we mention i bew profer n anapperson huge individual variability around those personally i be prophin is not very effective for me naperson is for others it may be just exactly the opposite there is valu in rotating them and finding out which works best for your particular situation youe mention the timing of it i be prophin is typically givnd no more than three times a day it is got a short halfl ive naperson twice a day what is critical i need to give this message is in both situations make sure that you have food in your stomach make sure you are not taking it on an empty stomach make sure you are drinking plenty of fluids and if you have got any im g iasues if you have got any bleeding his sues if you have got kidneasues if you have got hard issues talk to your doch talk to your clinition before you embark on this because these medicasions do have side effects and adverse consequence as invulnerable people what about asperan i've heard that aspern can benefit hurt health i take a baby aspern every day and if i have a pain that is just too intense for normal functioning as we are doefinding it then i'll increase that dose of asprn and i just assume asern is the healthiest and sad for me because well it is also good for her health and it is killing pain in those instances as supposed to taking anything else as my logic flod and if it is feelfree to tell me now for for you you'r logic is perfect and that is where it gets to the individual person and for a lot of people that model would work as well baby asperan eighty one melegrams a day acts as an anti platelet agan it helps here even though we are getting controversy over the rule of baby asern if you dive into the current literature a even baby ask eve controversion even baby asperin these days and now what they are doing with with the dat is defining age ranges when they say baby asperan yasbaby aspern now and iu aw we are learning a lot more about that i still take a baby aspernevery day ei take a baby aspern you get to the hir dose o say four times as much up around three hundred twenty five melegrams or it is now an antine flamatory it is now acting more the i be prophen than an aperson i'm different machanissm action at different doses i to take a brief moment and think one of our sponsors and that is ag one ag one is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains adaptigions i started taking ag one away back in two thousand and twelve the reason i started taking it in the reason i still take it every day is that it insures that i meed all of my quotas for vitemens and minerals and it insures that i get enough prebotic and probiotic to support got health now god health is something that over the last ten years we realize is not just important for the health of our got but also for our mune system and for the production of nauro transmitters and aromodulators things dopamin and seratonent in other words god health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course i strive to consume healthy whole foods for the majority of my nutritionolly take every single day but there are number of things in ag one including specific micron nutrians that are hard to get from whole foods ore at least in sufficient quantities g one allows me to get the vitemens and minerals that i need probitics prebotics the adaptidgens and critical micrnutrians any time somebody asks me if they were to take just one supplement what that supplement should be i tell them ag one because agy one support many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try agy one go to drink agy one dok clm slash humerman and you will get a your supply o vit em an d three k two and five free travel packs of ageyou one again that to drink agy one dok calm slash hubermen i promise we will not go into every medication in such detail but but these are the most commonly used over the counter treatments for pain as far as i know a are there any a issues with people who drink kaffin who then are taking these drugs are what are some of the a the interactions that these things can have as far as i know kaffine actually touches into the prostaglan in pathway does not yes and that is where you kno kaffin can buse effectively for headaches for my grains and i it cannot help potentiate a the analgesic response i some people get a stomach irritation though with kaffines sugjest a gan mind that you take an enseid with a a lot of coffee i have some food in your stomach you brought up early or a seat of manifan or tile an all tilon all does not have the same side effact or adverse event profile that the ensets do tilon all is safe on the stomach i'm where you need to be careful about tile an all is not to exceed four thousand meligrams or four grams per day individed dosis to extra strength tile in all done four times a day for many people is safe some say two graham some say for grams the key here is around your liver you have got good liver function if you are not abusing alkoholl that is a general rule of thum that you can use for tile in all i but it is not an upset your stomach there are versions of the enseds that we refer to is cok to inhibiters their very selective salacoxeb that is a less irritating on the stomach that is by prescription only though but you can think of it is working very much the same as the naperson an the i be prophen talk with your clinition to to try to tease those apart if you have problems in your stomach with the enseds and the really effective for you you can be given other types of medications that help block or reduce the g i issues associated with the ensets very useful information thank you yore were talking about chemical interventions to the pain process what about mechanical interventions i was taught in my basig nour f science about i think its millzack and walls gat theory of pain do i have this right where we all have this instinctual response animals have it too right if they a you bump your knee or your tow that you grabinin can rub it and that that rubbing response is actually cantr buting to the activation of a nerl pathway that does indeed reduce the pain through a legitimate nurl inabition in tell me if the the stillcence eredirrectin than i'll let you elaborate on it but i think that is an opportunity for us also talk more generally or for you to educate us more generally on the the mechanistic interventions for pain am maybe missage above or below the siht of pain maybe accu puncture am again there will be chemical consequence of any mechanical intervention ight as we know co that is the language of the nervous system electricity and chemicals but a suppose ta taking a drug you' imagine using manual am stimulation or rubbing around it or or perhaps we can also nock about heat and cold we explore that spase of it absolutely and first you are right i an your first part a pack a patrick wall ronmels ack luminaries in the field the pain back in the sixties a defind the gate control theory of pain and one of the things to build on the story that we talked about with no susceptors going to the spinal signals going to the spinal cord heading up to the brain where the perception of pain occurs that is not where the story ends turns out there are pathways that come down from the brain down from the brain to the spinal cord that act in an inhibatory roll and we will build on those also from the peripery we have got also fibres called touch fibres these are the ones were they get activated with touch stroking they refer to is a bate of fibres their fast conducting they head back to the spinal cord and they make some connections with those no susceptive fibres with that grounding imagine what you said you are you hit your thumb with a hammer you im a you bang something on an extremity a what is the first thing you do when you hit your thumb with a hammer a some people rub it i yell some people swear and it turns out their studies that show that swearing works really swearing reduces pain better than a then using non explicative a yes loud vocalizations yes swearing works i do not know why but othere is been it got some press when that paper came out and ye i do not i'm not giving cart blanch where it saying everybody can go out and swear every time they are in pain wel you they can but theyllhave to bear the consequences on any individual basis and 're not we are we are ebsolving ourselves a n asobil a rubbing a shaking is another one which basically is activating those touch fibres it is what if i do that ye everybody o yet everybody does not running it under water which yen it does not matter whether in this case it is hotters cold water it is the running of the water under neath it and what is it doing we all think it is reducing the stimulus out here and it is not at in the prifery in the prifery what is magical about thi think which is cool is your actually changing the signals in your spinal cord way back here in the neck this is the cheapest free version of what we refer to is narrow modulation that is ever been discovered am you are actually by doing that you are changing things the connections back in your spinal cord and it is reducing the no susceptive signals coming in here that is why we do it and it works it works butifully that is why when a kid get's the booboo parents common rub it it works what about the kiss that kids somedays ay wen a kiss you not ere a romantic partner will sometimes injure themselves i ges the defense of the age of the relationship andthe will shay can you kiss it of course tan you kiss it then that they feel better as that purely psychological well ok i think o an important point to to ground here when it comes to the experience of pain is it everything when we say psychological means narrow scienceyes for i no you no n no fray of me i i i i have to be careful with with the the wording that i use that is my fwut but it is it is accurate still it is psychological but it is narrw science based man thee really becoming one and the same but to answer your question yes by kissing it your activating touch fibers we can also agree that there is a positive emotional salience it is associated with that and that positive emotional salience is reducing pain to what interesting ua wall in mellsack sometime later a there wis the introduction of a devise to take advantage of this called the tens device and tends is an acranym transcutaneous electrical narrow stimulation and what the tens device is doing there is many versions of it now but there are those black electrodes you put over the area and they are hooked up to wires and when you turn it on it causes a buzzing sensation and tat buzzing sensation is activating those touch fibers the abate o fiberes and it is causing that narrow modulation back in the spinal cord mazing it is cool stuff it is very cool and at and i love that you emphasize that when you were rubbing the prifery or shaking our hand the prifery again being the body surface away from the brain that the real mechanism of action is taking place back in the spinal cord because it really speaks to the the body wide an the the circuit wide the nervous system wid nature of the thing that we call paint and it is it is happening out go to go out here in the prifery but it is been modulated in the neck level of the spinal cord approximately and then it is being interpreted at the level of the brain what explains different pain thresholds i could imagine it could be any ere all of the locations that we have been discussing yeand it could be the contect as well right if you are a you noi 've heard before and i wow know if this is true that if you have a lot of a drennlind epaneffern in your system that youre threshold for pain goes wayway up there is probably a chemical basis for that maybe it is all am anecdote but a certainly people have different thresholds for pain i for instance dou not have a high pain threshold but i've notice i have a very quick pain response if i stub my toe it feels the most painful thing i could possibly experience but then it is gone very quickly it is a quick inflection and then down other people i know ah we have never on the experiment ii'd see them stub their te in they ah and then your ten minutes later there still feeling the ache whose pain threshold as higher it is a it depends on ow you dofine painthreshold how do weu to find pain threshold what determins pain threshold and i guess the six million dollar question are there different pain thresholds between men and women as it relates to the whole story about child birth being very painful in that women qun't go have higher pain thresholds i juot it a sent you about tein questions yeh forgive me ye am what is pain threshold yet no it is it is a great place to start and may be i don'ot if you want a circle back around at some point to the heat and cold an es a mechanical for nomen on and your le me answer your get o your pain threshold pain threshold is a that stimulous intensity that results in the onset of the experience of paing the first onset of the experience of pain when you turn up the heat it is it is not when it is warm it is not when it is just hot it is when the heat becomes the perception of pain when it becomes painfully hot at that point in time the same works for cold you mentioned some of the distinction between your experiences of pain to a stimulus and your bodies and that is normal that first onset of pain again those are those fast fiberes tose adelti fiberes gome right to your brain those are the protective ones that when we put our hand on a hot stove we immediately jerk it back we do not even have a conscious perception yet that we did that and then it is a moment later when the sea fibres are getting up to the brain and the other adeltifibres are converging into conscious aries of brain that were a while that stove is really hot and the sea fibres and particular are converging on more emotional regions an the brain that are conveying an unpleasantness to that experience you do not it you and you do not want it to happen again which is why it incodes memories you only had to do that once is a child now getting into the the pain threshold you asked one of the other questions is do men and women have different pain on thresholds o the answer the short answers yes this has been established and i want to be careful here was saying a couple things one is in general a men have a higher pain thresholds to things heat stimulus than women and what people have to also though understand a scientists we make a big deal out of small differences right what we do as we take a group of people in this case men and women and we apply the same a thermal stimulus to them and we draw averages the average man has this stimulus the average woman has this stimulus and we say well women have a litte but more sensitivity to that heat stimulus and we then go into the press and we say on men are tougher than women that is a terrible statement re because the tough part is a subjective label ritemming it it it gets to a whole bunch of different issues around the adaptive role of pain right i mean it i mean cn one could argue that if your threshold for pain is lower that yours it serves them wore adaptive function i if the few ere injuries et cetera iman i get to get into the implications of what we mean by could not tofgfer it does but it also misses i think the big point which is people are not averages what i mean by that is i'm while the average for a woman may be somewhat less than a man if you look at the distribution of the curves they highly overlap meaning the individual variability within men and within women is much greater than the difference between men and women but there is plenty of women on that curve that have much greater heat a thresholds than men do but when you pool things you wend up with that difference unfortunately when things are picked up and you want a quick sound bide out of it that is what it gets to still down to not unlike height for that matter no lot of women that are taller than men that is exactly it but on average men are taller than women on average and i would say within this area of a pain threshold differences it is even closer it is even tighter yit would be on making this up the equivalent i think the average hide of a woman is five three five four or the averge hide of a man five nine five ten this is imagining the average height being five six for a woman and five eight for a man it is not a huge difference there is a lot of things that play into changes an pain thresholds how much and this is where the brain comes in because much of the no suception much of the signals thit were im transducing were transmitting in many of us it is very much the same it is when it gets to the brain now it' shaped and it' shaped by things such as im you are beliefs about that stimulus your expectations around it how much anxiety your having at the moment does increased anxiety increase one's perceived pain yes yeit does im you are early life experiences with is if you had tramatic experiences in the past that alters brain circuits can i interject a question y if one was told just suck it up a lot or if one whimpered or cursed when they a hurt themselves if they were told im you do not be a wose do not be a whim do we know whether r not that increases or decreases the subjective feeling of pain later i could imagine it going either way i could imagine the hid that was told do not be a wose when they cried as a consequence of expressing pain or an experience of pain secretly feeling more pain because they are not able to express the emotionality round the pain but that if we just look from the outside we thay wellit pretty tough adult right because they are not im crying out in pain younow do we have any are there any experiments that have explored that i do not know you are getting and this is a good point getting into im a pediatric pain and if there is been experiments in that space i stay mainly in the adultaria and my experience with raising a child is an and of one with one son don great thank i happen i know him very well he is a he is he is what you call it great example of highly successful reproduction say whether they say it is better to be lucky than good ah sir i'm sure there was a lot involved do not do not duscount it do not a do not discard any credit thank you thank you im my approach with een was not to say jut you' a necearly suck it up but i would a you do not make light of it i'd mad have fun with it and ah i would kind o laugh and on way to go body iand i would find he would often laugh i think a lot of it is taccuse ther taking off the parents again this is this is just my one of an parent is if they see you freaken out kids gen a freak out to im but does there get to be a point where you are ignoring your child or your love ones painful issue yt now you are getting into some maladapt of some bad space where they gets sending that person the wrong message and they may very well have problems later on i will tells jus a ve ry brief anecdote when i was growing up i observed a total of zero children and friends who you will cried out in pain or complained of pain who we are told im that wasn'n inappropriate response sometimes i might have heard parent say am i just suck it op or your rubb it you will be o k that kind of thing but once and only once with some friends i will not tell you it what country they were from but they they live not far from em we are both hen and i grew up since we grope near one another and i'll never forget that the younger brother of a friend of mine ran over to the father he ad cut his thumb on the band saw nd it was not particularly deep but he was crying in pain and the father rapped it picked up his chin and smacked him across the face an said do not ever do that again and what i think he was doing was compounding the the lesson about the saw yeh but clearly had no regard for the pain that the that the injury probably cause o i have not followed up with that kid yeum i think we can all agree that by to days standards that would be considered abusive parenting or perhaps one could say that was a on the far extreme of a response but i'll never forget that and i went home and i i told my mam and she said oh yet when i was growing up that was actually a more frequent response to kids hurting them themselves especially boys ye things have really changed in terms of how we react to children in pain but the reaso i find this interesting is that ultimately what were talking about is how should we interpret our own pain ye can i can i make a commentary about that senario and i want to bring in another narrow science concept that that dad may have been doing in advertently and that something called conditioned pain modulation there is another cool phenomenon and in pain that pain in hibits pain what i mean by that is when you were this guy this kid but are yourself growing upt to jever walk up to your body nsi you knowi i my arm really hurts i injured it the other day and what ad what did your body do they would stomp on your foot and you would say why the hac did you do that must have grown up at same from yeand and they tible now does not does not your arm feel better a me well he i does and yet i did grow up with those friends i tell this story to some people and i sometimes just get the wide eyes they did what yet we are not makeing recommendin owns here when i making recommendit but it is a real phenomenon it was described by le bars late seventy seventy eight or something that and rodan models initially and what happens is that when you engage a no susceptive stimulus or a painful stimulus in a sight distal different from where the primary pain is it engage as a brain stem circuit that has descending pathways to the spinaccord and inhibits pain amazement pain inhibits pain it works it also is hought to have some contributions from higher brain centers we calld this wholephinon the labars called thes phenomena defuse noxious an hibitory control or deneck the human version of this is called conditioned pain modulation why i bring this up not only to help explain that father's actions somehow i do not think that he was thinking on my kids got a painfuline ah you now hand or finger he cut himself on it o slapm off the side of the had he will feel better i do not think that is what was going through on to make him feel worse we did not go near the band saw without any more cautious let it crobably did reduce the pain a little tat to some extent now where it is he is i maybe we will get into it later with chronic pain is in some cronic painful conditions the s p amer that dednech does not work firo mialga being one am pain inhibits pain ah is another narrow science concept related to pain thit is rather cool well and i'm sorry i missed your question no if you repeat no yo you'are no in you answer the question and and a expanded on it in a it completely surprising and far more interesting way than i ever anticipated to thank you i i'm betting that ninety eight per cent of people listening to this including myself have never heard that pain in hibits pain incredible let us go back to heat and cold we briefly touched on heat but let us talk about the use of a coun't qut theraheutic heat or therepeutic colda a cold pack for a a a you kdont bruse that really aches or maybe even a break or a sprain or heat you kow the in the world of sport physio cold is now heavily debated localized cold is heavily debated au yo get people saying things i do not know if this is true that it creates a slodging of the of the fluids trying to head in and out of the injury o cold is not as good as heat heat allows for am the a inclusion and removal of waste products and there all sorts of just stories that people make up some of which might be true i do not know but what do we know about heat and cold as physiological stimule in terms of their ability to ameliorate to help pain because of course if you get things hot enoug for you get them cold enough you can create pain with heater cold but let us assume we are not getting to that level of heat or cold and one is in pain a when i was a kid we hat a hot water bottle that four times when we were sick wer something but sometimes you nof if i felt an ache on the side of but some hot water in t hot water botte wy on that thing want some cartuns a defiling felt better sure sure well putting aside the contemporary controversies over the mechanisms you described which ar i think very real and need to be sortd out traditionally historically we tend o think of applying cold for the first forty eight hours or after an acute injury and then heat thereafter cold has some really cool effects cold a reduces inflammation reduces some of the release of those inflammatory chemicals we tauht about prostic land ands side kinds histomeans am other cema kinds all these fancy terms for substances that sensities the primary no susceptor and it reduces the release of those and it reduces inflammation another cool thing often not appreciated is nerves do not fire is fast when they are cold and if you have got no susceptors that are firing and you put cold it is slowing the number of signals coming up and by definition it is reducing the the the ultimately the painyer experiencing now heat heat has an obvious effect of increasing blood flow it is going to help ah relax muscles and get blood into those muscles and that is probably why youare putting that hot water bottle on ah and it just darn feels good and whuld what do i tell people in part i tell people use whichever works best for them ah i find there is huge individual variability and wether people heat or cold an within reason ah they are safe what do i mean within reason do not go putting an ice pack on an extremity for too hours you will get a frostbite you non't take care with that how cold should one make the point of their body that is in pain assuming of course that the'r notkin they give themselves frost bite meaning do you want to numb the area you will get past that point where it is a little bit painful and then the basically you are shutting down some narrl pathways and you do not feel anything there it is numb and then you let the blood flow return when you remove the cold pack is that i mean it is a rasonable suggest chokat yw well people i thing wil appreciate that the a the specifics of that because ah you do not of course listeners this podcast often are insted in whol body deliberate cold emmerge in you now cold chours ice baths et cetera most people experience those that somewhat painful as they get into them ye and then can experience some numbness when they get out is it possible to raise ones pain threshold through the regular exposure to pain and ways that are safe such as deliberate cold exposure assuming that one does not stay in too long it is not too cold ah and or through you do not etime ut sports earli or but just in general can we raise our pain threshold that life is less painful the short answer to your last question as yes ah the answer to you other question about a extreme cold and cold exposure which i know you have a lot of experties s and you can teach me lot ominous stay in my wheel house a cause i i'm not up on the literature in that space even in its intersection with pain am it is an intriguing concept ah i have to imagine that it make sense you would get some habituation ah with that repeated exposure i think one of the the questions it would come up with for instance the cold exposure and i do not know the answer to the putits i'm sure maybe somebody out there does is is their crossmodality am changes and pain thresholds i mean if you expose yourself a lot to cold does it change your heat threshold i do not i would surprise be surprised if it did i would wore your threshur athos are separate parallel pathways ye ye ther a and as an aside i hate the cold but i do really well with the heat and does heen ah yound i think there is something genetic there ah i mentioned earlier around men and women and heat ah thresholds and i chose that specifically but each of these are different depending on the stimulous modality can you change ultimately your thresholds ye wear that involves is a lot of cognative control it is a lot of cognitive training ah around that space and there is there is clearly approaches to that people have learned that there is different manipulations around that one experiment this wasnat intended tleast i do not believe they were measuring a heat thresholds ah i'm college students soon and we we experiment a lot on students as as we all know we pay them well am and what they found is that when therre studying guse studying dus when there was an attractive woman who was delivering the stimulus the thresholds were higher because the guie did not want a look a woos in front of this attractive young woman and that is been pretty well established the experiment or their gender ah plays a big roll in that as the reverse experiment also been to i do not i do not know i do not know jst m but getting back to your point yes am i think through a number of a cognitive manipulations you can ultimately a over time change those thresholds another one area is exercises movement exercise clearly changes o those thresholds over time you ere probably building up am some increased and hibitory tone through that process i to thinke at quick break and thank our sponss are inside tracker inside tracker as a personalized nutritian platform the analiz s is data from your blood an diana to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health calls i've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long turm health can only be analyzed from a quality blood tast i majour problem with a lot of blood tests out there however is that you get information back about metabolic factors lipids and hormones and forth but you do not know what to do with that information with inside tracter they make it very easy bcause they have a personalized platform that allows you to see the levels of all those things metabolic factors lipids hormones et cetera but it gives you specific directives hat you can follow that relate to nutrition behav oural modification supplements et cetera that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you if you would to try inside tractor you can go to inside tracor dot calm slash huberman to get twenty percent off any of inside tractors plans again that is inside tractor dot calm slash hubermen one thing unfascinated by in the whole mindfulness space is this idea of whether or not under conditions of stress or in this case pain whether or not the most adaptive mind set assuming it is not a tissue damaging level of pain would be to think about something else distract oneself from the pain or conversely whether not one should quoto q go into the pain for people who have chronic pain maybe it is in it a small ary of the body that experiences chronic pain pain quite often ah a chronic pain or maybe it is whole body pain i do not think it realy matters for the question i'm asking and people are trying to develops some cognative was of what we call as near a scientists you and i top down mechanisms for thing ochaomen o distract myself from the pain i'm in a focus on other things i really enjoy or rather i'm going to wel go into the pain meet the pain and realize sidonal somehow that it is not as bad it somehow there is a and again this becomes very opaque right we do not really know whotver talking about when we when we do these sorts of protocals but those sorts of things are out there in the mindfulness space and i think a i certainly take mindfulness seriously as as an intervention but what always bothers me about those sorts of interventions as ha lack the specificity in the grand ularity and there is no an a mechanistic logic to explain them andso what woutd your thoughts on on meeting the pain verses distracting oneself from the pain let us break that down cause there is two concepts there as you alluded to and they are both effective and they both work differently one is attentional distraction where you are distracting yourself from the thing that is causing pain clearly works in a lot of people and that is why onted the strategies that we recommand for patients for people living with pain is to engage in distracting ac tivities read a book i'm id go for a walk i'm you spend time with friends and family in particular in the community and work to get your mind off of pain what we have learned is it that attentional distraction engages specific brain net works they tend to be some of the outer layer of braing net works and your prefernal quartec some in your singular quartec a in other regions which are clearly involved with distraction it is not necessarily that distraction has geen a completely eliminate one's pain but it can reduce it a significantly and this is why the biggest problem with distraction from a time of the day is it night it is when people are trying to sleep sturing the daytime you can read that book you can spend time with friends and family but people with chronic pain that have a twenty four seven you cannot distract yourself at night when you are trying to get into a relaxe state and fall asleep and that is why sleep is such a big issue for people with chronic pain attentional distraction it it works distraction works now what you said i'min the second piece you said kind of let us meet the pain if you will and there is different approaches to meeting the pain one approach that you invoked with mindfulness is addressing the pain from a non judge mental accepting manner i'm aware of the pain is there i am not going to judge it i'm not going to put a value on it is bad it is good or anything i'm just gin a note its presence and that has been shown to work as well in fact actually when john cabits in originally developed mindfulness bastress reduction people low back pain plenty of studies have shown that it works i've completed to some recent studies in embi s are a as well and we are diving deeply into the data it is this non judgemental acceptance of you will of the pain sorry mbe as ars theccan were mindfulness based stress reduction embi us are everybody should do enb us are let me bei have no financial relationship with any of this by the way but mindfulness basstress reduction has been shown a factiv for anxiety for depression for pain just about everything i think they should put it into all the schools ah it is it is a great skill to learn no side of facts takes little bit are time to learn it and a it can be in some people effective and helpful for pain and that is the key that were gon to keep coming back to is some of these things work for some of the people some of the time there is a third aspect of meeting the pain and that is more of a direct cognative refraiming about the meaning of the pain now you are coming at the pain and you have a an approach you are making effort on what you are thinking of the pain is that pain damaging threatening harmful or do you view it is yet it hurts but it is not harming me that is a critical critical aspect of pain management and that is serves as a foundation for something called cognitive behavioral therapy the the cool thing about a number of ise is that there is actually different norl circuits engaged with these different approaches and am i think the key that we have to figure out this is were researchis going is which approach works for which person under which circumstance interesting a it' something you said about understanding the pain but not a over interpreting our catastrophising the pain seems important knowing the difference between being hurt or feeling hurt verses being injured as been something hat's been important to me i been involved in sports a where clearly pain was involved cam hurt but am my injured that is the first question i've rolled an ankle ah it lenting this hurts in my injured meaning in my ging o be back ad it and an hour or to morrow verses i'e broken bones and its ayou know great embathy for anybody that does tik when you are injured you feel a snap and you are out for a while in some cases a i think knowing the difference between being hurt and being injured is something that is ov that key moment and for me it is always been experience as a moment of anxiety after feeling pain puching a smort youre ah i a ma my can have to take to eas off or is this just pain i think for people to be able to recognize when pain is reporting an injury verses when pain is just reporting a temporary sensation is really important and perhaps also for psychological hurt verses psychological injury and that gets to some larger context theemes these days of somebody says something it upsets us are we hurt are we injured right i think it gets very murky it is o how does one determined if they are hurt verses injured and then may we could even stretch into the psychological realm neither of us or psychologist but it sounds much of what you do represents the the bridge from the body into the mind and ou be remiss if we did not talk about emotional pain as well yes what you just said your spot your spot on andrew and tat one of the key messages the key macky's tips for pain management is to understand the distinction between hurt verses harm hurit it verses harm critical absolute critical leme allow me to illustrate with im patient i saw will not name names sometime ago guis in his forti's a master's level tennis player tennis is his life he is works i some executive somewhere but he lives for tennis comes hobbling in on crutches sit is down and he is got pain in his foot and he was told not to put pressure on his foot because he is got this injury ng iss can be worse and this has been going on now for months and he is now depressed cause he cannot play tennis tenisis his life disguise life is tennis i examine this guime and it turns out what he has as something called im morton's naroma and a morton's naroma is a fibrous thickening of tissue around the nerves that go to your tose and it is gets to be his bundle tissue nerves and it is really painful i'm it is very painful but it is not causing harm there is no harm there it is really painful explain this to the go and he looks at me would this lightbulb goes off he is you mean i can play tennis and a my gagi you can go play all the tenniss you want it just goen a hurt he got up he left the crutches and the examle office and he walked away now that is an extreme example i do not want people please to think that that kind of thing occurs all the time it does not i'm chronic pain conditions are often incredibly complicated and need much more than a forty five menute or sixty menute education session and back to the tennis cort he still had pain in his foot by the way but he could play but that gives that example of a dressing that fear and the anxiety are around that that issue and i think that is what we first have to learn is does that pain that we are experienceing represent something that is harming us that something that weither need to seek a medical attention now or sometimes soon and whether does continued activity worse in the tissue injury or not in my world where i'm carrying mostly for people with chronic pain we have moved beyond the tissue yealing by definition by one of the definitions for chronic pain is that the pain persists beyond the time of tissue healing in many of r sessions are times we are educating people hurt verses harm it is back pain we we evaluate this mine we make sure is the sfine stable is there anythings sinister causing damage in most of the cases it is not and we help people understand that distinction critical critical for people and yet at the same time you do not want to just ignore something thit is a real medical issue that is getting worse and needs medical attention and that is where the complexity of all this comes in did i answer your question if beautifully i think this distinction between hurt verses harmed is important for people to hear a perhaps you are wlling to expand a little bit in terms of the psychological hurt verses harmed i man i'm not asking you to comment on an socital or generational shifts but we would be avoiding the obvious if we did not say that in the last i'm really tend to fifteen years has been a pretty dramatic shift in terms of how society at large interprets emotional pain right people hearing things or seeing things and the idea that emotional pain could be related to physical pain or at least similar enough to it that people's emotional pain is valid right and if anything i'm here to validate the fact that emotional pain is valid any other pain accept it is different because it becomes very hard to point to a specific an threshold reason that were t o lot to day but i think it is appropriate here threshold between hurt and harmed whereas if i tell you that my left foot hurts which it did a lot in high school and then you took an extray of my foot ind highschool you would say your foot's broken cause it was broken a lot in high school and that is harmed i mean to continue to do what i was doing to break it in the first place i was harm clearly going to harm myself worse ihad to i to heal up but when it comes to psychological pain yo psychitry has all these thresholds for normal functioning verses abnormal functioning or you sleeping well normal relationship and on and on we do not want to go there s it is not our place but how do you when you see patience how do you take in to account the level or the thresholds for their emotional pain because it is part of your job i'm asking you this from the perspective of a somebody who treats pain how do you gage somebody is psychological pain is it by how intense lee they vocalized their pain or does it always go back to how well or poorly their life is being managed at the level of sleep nutrition relationships and forth youave great great set of questions s a lot in there let me first start off with something very simple i do not try to distinguish between this notion of psychological pain physical pain it is pain and of and of i think once i get into you get into this trying to distinguish as a psychological pain or psychogenic pain which was a terrible term or physical pain you end af putting value judgments on people and i do not think it serves as well when we are caring for the person in front of us if they are in pain i'm addressing the pain the thing to note is at least in people t o come into our it stanford ain management center an other pain centers is that remember pain is a censory an emotional experience it is all rapped up and we want to treat the whole person sometimes we get we get easy we get easy ones and we just go do a nerve block and pain goes away and that is simple but usually it is much more complex we are were seeing the interaction a a an exexpression of pain that includes a significant amount of anxiety of depression you mention this term catastrophizing which we can break down if you would and that is probably one of the biggest predictors factors and ah and amplification of pain and worsening pain ind portreatment response is catastrophising i'm i try to treat the whole person and not really parcel out all this i do it standford i you i built ta digital health system that captures measures a lot of data a round a patient's experience across physical psychological and social functioning and we use that data to target therapies to understand i'm how much your depressive symptems are anxiety anger anger big issue and pain huge in pain does it make it worse or better invariably it makes it worse yeand you can break anger down in a couple different categories john burns and others has broken in in to anger anverse is anger out i enough that terms familiar with you i'm anger out that is my father i'm loud loud angery boisterous banging would quickly turn anything into an angry tirate anger out expressive yelling at the at the news yes yelling it somebody cuts you off and trap it usually yelling at the man ah it could he hate it is job i'm anger in boiling simmering self contain seething that is anger and data seems to support anger in his is worse it is bad it is not asserily whether not's directed it some one external in both cases anger in an anger out can be directed somewhone external its a question of whether it is expressed outwardly or contained inside beautifully stated beautifully stated we cat anger depression anxiety ih we kept yure fatigue sleep and t we try to do is again look a the whole person because they are not just to back if that is where there having pain ore not just a neck or a shoulder in your case it is impacting the whole person and we just got done talking earlier about how all these circuits interact with each other and sometimes we cannot just eliminate the no seception in the perifery sometimes we can reduce it but what we have to do is target everything and we have to try to target all these circuits up here and in many cases what we are doing is through education through pain psychology am through physical theropean realyreabilitative approaches on top of it and yes the medications we have now we touched base on a few earlier but we have over two hundred medications available for pain am very few of a meftier approved a we tend to steal from all the other fields you say but more than two hundred medications that can be yes prescribed for pain but as awfulabel treatments perfectly stated y there is only a few medications that are actually ftier approve specifically for pain what we what we do is we borrow or steel from the psychiatrists some of their a their antidepressents ah which will frequently work very effectively for pain and work on those pain related circuits in the brain we a take from the neurologists some of the anti seizure medications because those medications m while reducing separately seizures for people who do not have seizures they work on i on channels am they work on other nermodulators that also are involved in pain circuitry we can take from the cardeologists medications that work on the heart anti a rhythmiour hart rhythm drugs they are potent sodium channel blockers and the sodium channels as are responsible for the action petential that generates the nerve impulse signal and they are an orl local anethetic that you take and we we we take from everybody in our field in the medications getting back to to what you said just summarizing one i do not really distinguish a psychological verseis physical pain and my world i i find it better just to treated as pain and look at the perseon holistically an go after all the components at once i find that is where we get the best results and it is typically bringing a lot of tools to bear speaking of tools to bear what rule if any does nutritian play in local orse whole body pain i critical and i think we are learning more and more and more about a the r ole of good nutrition of healthy eating antine flamitory diets avoidance of foods that ar triggers a and i incredibly under appreciated area amyou know i've had my experiences with chronic pain am i developed an abdominal chronic pain problem a shortly after i turned fifty i was throwing a happy hour for our paint psychologists of all people wen to a mexican restaurant i will not name which one got food poisoning that is whay i'm not naming it good mexican food bad food poisoning and ever since that event i cannot eat anything in the onion family what i'm familiar with onions but what else is an t enion family i metter you have researchs now pretty thoroughly considering what you are describing classic and what we refer to his fod maps it is one of the fod maps and i have now some issues with the others and am manifested by just severe severe up or dominal pain and a not many other symptoms but it put me on this journey where a severe abdominal pain did not know why could not sleep could not sleep went i'd go months without having a restful nights sleep i thought i was getting early all timers because i thelght i was getting stupid and i'm what actually benefited me was of all things the pandemic why cause what a we all do we isolated we started eating the same foods and i started noticing i was feeling better when i was eating certain foods my bdominal pain went away and i'd start doing as a scientist experiments and i finally was able to isolate and determine what the problem was now i have complete avoidance on that i'm i'm a little difficult to go out to a restaurant and have dinner but udon' know onions noiniance and what ell shall its chibes scallyans leaks anything in the onion family not alium i'm fine with garlic and by healthy eating by identifying something by triggers changed my life and return to a degree of normal sey i think the key for people is if you have any kind of similar issues identify those triggers sometimes a isolation of foods or restrictions and using a journal and then as you learn from that slowly build foods back into your diet think it important for people to hear this and thanks for sharing your personal story round this because i think that nutricion well every physician seems to appreciate that called even nutrician matters defining what callty nutri tion is is really difficult there is still ave it even we could call them ranchorous debates about this you of eginverse is ominob orders is this and but it sounds this is a case where it can become very individualized but i could imagin somebody going to their physicion and that physician not being you and saying yet i knotice that when i eat certain foods em in a lot of pain and the physician simply saying will do not eat those foods but unless that person is a traind scientists tnot knowing how to go about doing the sorts of experiments that you did would be difficult impossibly i'm sorry i know i interrupt you i just wone of ites build on that if iagain one of the key things i simplified my story but the keything is as if i if i eat onions or anything an onion family it is pain for two weeks it is the thing is is if you get repeated exposures it never stops and it gets very very hard to figure out what it was it is not you eat something you get pain it goes away where we can all do that pattern recognition here you have to be able to think back what happened two weeks ago that may have influenced it it is not easy this may be a case for elimination diets which ar a provide theire done safely where people restrict the number of foods they eat to a very limited number of foods make sure they still get en ough callories and makrnutrians a th that they need proating fats in carbor hydrades or what it would have you but that by limiting tha total number of foods of the eat is eat or ten basic things then you can build things in and then explore what triggers the pain or what removes the pain i do not really see any other way i am entrigued by the onion example even though it is it is a it is your case in particular we do not want extraplate to broadly is there is something about onions that is triggering or particular nor a chemical or immune pathway o do we have any knowledge of why onions would create that kind of got pain this has been a journey i've been on now for a few years to answer this im ione of our gi paindocks that we have come cling to linen to wind sent me a paper from i know seller nature that should that after i got infection it can change the genetic expression related to sensitizing you to food antigens i know i threw out a lot a jargon thei're basically the short answer as you get in infection and you are got no longer responds properly to a normal food item and one explanation may be i got this infection is hat a mexican restaurant lot of onions and i got sensitized through that infection now subsequently to onions i saw a a stanford i aler just ahanna watford whose awsome by the way and i after i' had this i think figured out and i went in and unlike well i now doctor watforders or anything i can do for this and she laughed and he is know you'r doing everything it is all just avoidance and i thinking i was rather unique and special about this thing i said toever see this and she said oh yi see us all the time every day i see this all the time and i slike this isn'n unusually si no i see this thing all the time and the sine meaning sensitive tet iiiitet as certain ot o certain to different these different food groups ind this this thing that occurs later in life something an event that happens to somebody the triggers and i said will cah that sounds a public health problem and she is that is what we are debating right now in the olergy community is whether this is representing more of a public health issue and is cause i'm seeing i doctor watford im seeing increasing amounts of this as we go forward how interesting well am this is not a time to plug the philanthropic arm of or premium pad gasbut i'm very involved in science philanthropy that sounds an area to ddevotes sem funding you to explore how foods are impacting the local and systemac pain response yi i got in you ow i'm running a large byo marker studyed a characterized people deeply and one of the things that i wanted to put in there as mycrobyum characterization now to be clear that is out of my wheel house but the beauty of being at stanford and other major institutions as you can go make friends yet just in soninberg who is been a guest on this ifhod gas is one of the world experts on the gutmycroby and we have a few others to ter ogos is a friendly gy i'm sure hill colavory we go we go make friends and people who understand the mycrobyum we collect the samples and that is where team science is magical and once agan the idea looking at the whole person as long as we are talking about the gut am let us talk about pain inside the body because we talked about nocessceptors on the surface of the body and the pain that most people i immediately think of when you have a discussion about pain is yon pain on the surface are a broken bone or maybe hit pain or need pain or back pain but what about pain that resides deeper in the vicera i' got pain a irritable bowel sindrum these things are i'm learning a far more a common then am that i knew i'm fortunate that am if ihave a stomach ach er ahead ache mean somethingns wrong i rarely get those of it sometimes been go that younhough stomach of steal not because it is hard from the outside am but because i can eat pretty much anything although i pretty cleanly a lot of people rite to me and ask questions on social media about irritable ballsondrum and other forms of got pain and vier of pain pain that they feel is really deep within their system typically how is that sort of pain dealt with at a clinical level absolutely thisral pain is a different thing thand what we have been describing a lot of which a symatic pain by the way i'll say is an aside i used to have a got of steel also i could ch np down anything any time anywhere and there was a lot of grief and loss associated with not being able to eat certain foods and a that is also something people have to come to grips with am but getting back toe viceral pain the thing about sematic pain that is another term now sematic meaning the soma the the the extremity that you are alluding to is the no susceptors there a very precisely localiyes where the stimulus the painful stimulus is coming from when you hit your thumb with a hammer exactly were that pain occurred with the viceral pain what you have are very difuse what we refer to his receptive fields think about you last time you had a stomach ache it is not that you put your thumb right here he said i in hurts likenes the olestom whole stomach it is because those receptive fields are very large their broad they are not as well localized and ipart the reason for that type of broad receptive field is you are not trying to get away from localized danger when people get stomacates its often a very broad area when you get palvic pain it is the same type of thing now there some fascinating stuff that occurs with viceral pain because thes fibers that extend from the vicera meaning the the lungs the abdomen the palvis they all head under the spinal cord to and it just happens that they make kind of indirect direct connections with the same level that represents the body let us think about palvic pain for instance you frequently will find people that say had that have palvic pain tha will describe having lower back pain to and it is because of this viceral sematic convergence in the spinal court it is not that there something going on in their back it is at these signals that are being driven heavily from the palvis are coming in in connecting with the same regions from the back and the convergence of that is now being perceived as pain in both and were we we are seeing that more or more in the research this vicero sematic convergence people have pain in their palvis and and also over their abdomen am classic one that ah we are aware of we see this in the tevy the movies and unfortunately realie for heart attacks the viceral fibers that subserve the heart typically the ferse through the fourth thoracic reg ion well those converge im in the spinaccort in similar regions that subsurve sensation under the arm a d uphere that is why people loftan say they have got pain with a heart attack radiating down into their arm the left arm tothe left arm the heart is on the left side exactly im after people get adominal surgery sometimes some blood can leak out and it will slip underneath the diafram the diaphram is subserve by some of those neck regions three four and five of the survicl which happens to also cover your shoulder and you will get people after a dominal surger this and my shoulders really hurting me doc and what we do is we first check to see unow could something have happened during anas unow during placemen just make sure there is nothing wrong but frequently it is due to irritation that is again one of the magical mysteries it fascinating about pain seems a good point to bring ap reference pain i or is what you are describing an example of reference pain miner san of reference pain is that no what for instance i i've got a slight bulgeeat i think my lumbar three four disk or something i had a whole body scan recently just a i an exploration scan cas i had the opportunity not not anything serious fortunately and there is a slightly bulged is there and every one's in a while if i do certain movements im in the gim i'll get pain down in my right hip an sometimes going down my leg an isithing yo as siatica cause i you usume anything on the right back side ocase must be wallit induced siot siatic a back pocket while it into siatica im but what i eventually realized is that well it is this disbulge just happens that the nerves that emit from that that region im they branch out to buncher differin aireas and you think the pain is in your leg but the the issue is some place else or im an occasionally indeed i feel the pain elsewhere my body is well it is or a a matching of regions for pain that seem unrelated is that a way to think about reference pain perfectly the the the examples also i referred to of a hard attack causing referred pain or also the pelvic region associated with back pain is a way of im referred pain i what your describing is the fact that pain does not have to start with an injury or a stimulus in the perifery you could damage unthe nerves anywhere along the way and that will be perceived as pain we refer to that is nerrow pathic pain that is another distinction you brought up a nicely good good segway into there is thought to be am several different types or categories of pain we have been talking through much of this time about symatic pain then injury out here we talked about viceral pain and when you have damage to a perferal nerve damage injury to a perferal nerve or the central nervous system we refer tur that is nerw pathic pain it frequently has different qualities different characteristics people will refer to it is shooting stabbing shock burning it can frequently when there is a damage to a nerve or damage to certain regions of the brain beingcredibly challenging to treat by the way the good news is with that a light discopulge is the vast majority of time the discs re absorb e i have to be careful to not it du too much a spinol afflection sit up saind stuff i thought that that would help ut that asshe does not strengthen the back it was actually a a symmetry between the abdominal muscles and the lowr backmuscles is provided i dea a lot of back extension type the training then that bulge more less tays in i just have to be little cautious not too cautious fortunately as lons were toik about referenced pain symatic viceral and all the rest what about associative or reference pain wear it is psychological and i do not want to get too abstract here but more and more these days i hear from people who say i was in this job and the job socked or i was in this relationship in the relationship socked and i had terrible back pain really acute localized back pain or chronic headaches or my grains noand then they go on vacation or they change their circumstances and lowne behold thebeing goes away does that surprise you as an expert an pain note at all note at all mature at simpli a symplistically referring to as thers people are undergoing stress and we have we clearly know that the brain is not a passive recipient of information coming in from the body it is a twoway street the brain is causing down strean consequences in the body the brain a controls are sympathetic nervous system and pari sympathetic nervous system the sympathetic being the fight and flight response it controls the tone of a cortoissal that is being released and we all know that and acute situations rapid increases of cordisal and am nora dranalin is keeps us away from the lions and tigers in the bears om i but in a chronic situation and a robert supulsky as at stanford has built a career around chronic stress at least in part and very bad for us and these chronic stressors inpactd the andorgan the tissue and it is real pain it does not mean that we need to go get back surgery it means at probably we need to identify the stressors that are contributing to that and address those and we will often fine then the senaras you outline that the pain gets better am some of those targets are interesting im there is a lot of memory associated with pain this is where early life events occur and those early life events in injuries consensitize us to future vulnerability i was in a car act bad caracinet when i was sixteen ah fortunate to walk away from it got bad whiplash if i get stressed a lot of my pain manifests in my neck for me as a pain dack it is a signal to me that is go work out go for a walk in the forest ah and take some time away from the computer again that is a simplistic message and my experience does not translate into everybody else but i'm just validating everything hat you you said let us consider the opposite senarea which is positive emotions a you have done some very nice studies exploring how being in positive relationships being in love in fact an change our perception that is our experience of pain and probably does it real physiological levels aes you mentioned earlier psychological is physiological invice versa it is hard to separate the two but cund you share with us a what you did in that study ind what you found because i find it really interesting and it also points to the incredible power of love in how we experience life ye yet i think there is several cool things about that study that i love to share one is how it all came about a us naro science keeps often go to the society for naro science as an annual meeting and i was hanging out and a sharing the room with art air and who studies passionate love and he and his wife study passionate love and weere having a glass or two of wine and maskanard if you ever au we we ever studied pain i's nyi study love e's have you ever study le now i study painte is hen me ever study the intersection another glass of wine no let us do it we came back to stanford and there was a young postock jerred younger who is now a professor at the universyalabama and i said jered werething on a fault flat in her face or wergan a this is goingto be a cool study and jerred took this on great job what we did is we adverti ized on campus for couples in an early phase of a romantic relationship because there is a reason for choosing that in an early phase of a romantic relationship you are deeply focused on your beloved they are on your mind all the time you feel great when you are with them you feel terrible when you are not with them does not that just sound an addiction i means that yearning i do not know that is i's can be a pleasant experience that but addictions for the people who are using the substance can find it in that early phase very pleasant but it it turns out that the early phse of a romantic relationship engages the same narl circuitries as a diction interestin same reward circuitry all that we chose that and we said come to us in bring pictures of your beloved and bring pictures of an equally attractive acquaintance clothed this is not sex that were studying clea clothed and we cause them pain in the scanner and and and we paid them afterwards am we needed a control condition for this because thinking about your beloved is very attentionally demanding member we talked about attentional distraction earlier we gave people what is called a word generation task very simply a can you think about every sport that does not involve a ball frizby hacky a boxing oh that is attentionally demanding think about every vegetable that is not green n your brning the three had and were causing you pain it is an attentional distraction task we flash people pictures of their beloved cause paying flash people of their acquaintance causepain an an distraction o what ae we find love works great love works great it was a wonderful anal jesic it is significantly reduced people's pain and it turned out the more in love you were the more pain relief you got when viewing the photo of the person you love yes win viewing the photo of the person you love now how did we know how much in love they were it turns out the psychologists have got scales for everything and one of them is a passionate love scale which ask how what percentage of the day are you preoccupied thinking about your beloved oh goodness you just sent people now off to give their partners the passionate love scale that hrug out how much time they are spending thinking about them yet we we had stanford student some of them thinking about their beloved eighty per cent of the day i wanted to use thus as a screening tool for our resident applicants because a why i want them focussing on patience not their beloved and that is by the way a joke that bad joke but but it probably i is t real world were not just tu i about standford oming oh no when somebody is writing you a script or a prescription that is ore giving you advice a yet you may want to know if they are in it a new romantic relationship yet that the the other i thought the other a cool thing about this study was attention worked also but attention and love worked on different circuits attentional distraction they worked equally well attention again worked on some of these prefrontal regions these outer cortical areas love worked on more of what we classically think of as these reward bas circuits the neucli seccumbents on the amigdala a one of the the desscending a brainsten regens called the substantial nigra whichis coming down from the brain through that area to the spinalcord to inhibit pain classic addiction pathway classic and the key again message for people is a different what we would think of his psychological approaches engaging different brain circuits to reduce pain i'll leave you with one last a side note that we did not publish on and that is a gered went back a year later and we a sessed the students strength of their relationship soming was still on going and he found that there was a rather high correlation between the love induced anal gesia and brain activity and the caudate neuclius and in the insler with the strength of the relationship a year later it was we had a brain scan that was a predictor of future a strength of a relationship could you tell us the direction of those results if a new romantic partnership is a creating high levels of activity in these two brainareas you just mentione then it is a very good predictor that the relationship will yes survive overtime well in this limited sample it meant that it it was going to be very strong a year later i'm understand and we always have to put these caviats sh unpublished non pure reviewed it was a fun posttak date analysis that i'm not sure if anybodiese of er run with those kind of things no but we can explore it in it in a playful way now ind people can do with it what they will it does sort of speak to something important though a assuming that result would hold up if the same experiment were done and may many hundreds of thousands of people sor speaks of the idea that the activation of these addiction circuits in the early phase of a passionate love relationship set in motion a certain number of things that create stability in that relationship which on the face of it a make sense but we have also all heard at the opposite way of well as well which is am fools rush in or that a things that start fast and fast or things that but here you talking about am the early phase of pashion serving the interesting role in terms of anogesia a alleviating pain but also predicting some stability of the relationship over time is kind of interesting it is fascinaing to talk about ih you ni feel i have to put that chavioding that not generalizes but a fun thing to tame it and it is where i think cool scientific ideas can come from for future exploration that i think that is also what is pretty need am i find the am again the different circuits for different approaches to reducing pain fascinating again that gets to the question of as me earliers are one circuit and the answer is now what we have to do is figure out what is the best circuit for a particular person or set of circuits if you are willing i'd to talk about opioids first if you could educate us on indogenous opioids the opioids that we make inside of our body that we do not that meaning nobody takes as a drug and then how that in forms opioids that people take i mean clearly the called opioid crisis is a concern many people addictod t opioids people have died from taking too many opioids but presumably some people of benefit from these opioi drugs as well ud to talk about that and then i'd to also talk about some of the am things that ar adjacent to the prescription opioids things cradum which right now or peatns wor hav called into question as to whether or not they will continue to be legally available over the counter first and foremost whatever the indogenos opioids how do they work and that i think we will set the stage for the rest yow we all have these and dogenis and capalins and dorphans that am act as pain killers they are a analgesics they are a natural substances and all of us that get expressed ah there is a certain indogenous tone to these that some have a done research on here again gero did research on this and stephen rule an others on showing that higher and dogeinousopoid levels may am lead to less emotional reactivity for instance am thank god we we know we have and dogenis opiod sir we know we just could not handle it am what chemis of figured out is how to bring in an exogenos opioids and morphine was the protetypical one out from the h from the popy and since then medicinal chemis have built on variations of morphine and created other compounds some again variations on morphine some ar purely synthatic the aoxy codon could asccuestion because unfascinitg by the history of these things how did ere wen end or wended somebody look at the popy and then say ominoust art eating popies r isolating things from popies and realize that the morphine thousands of years ago as popies ave been use fory very long long long time these things have been around am this is a this is old school work that is only been refined in more contemporary history and the wholl topic of opioids is such an incredibly controversial area and i i feel i have to you have to understand the speaker might in this case me might uno one's position on this am my usual montres i am not proopioid i am not antiopiod i am propation i have seen opioids positively transform people's lives help them get back to work spend time with friends and family relieve suffering paticularly in situations a and of life bhut also in people with chronic pane and i have seen opioids destroy lives at a personal level i come from a family background deep deep in addiction i have lost close loved family members to addiction and i'm respectful of that what i've learned is to not get into this binary mode of thinking it is either this or it is this but to treat opoids as a clinition as a tool to be used in certain circumstances in some people not typically as a front line or first line agent am typically much later down if they have failed other therapies you cannot approach the challenge of opioids ah without appreciating the deep complexity that were faced with particularly now in society with all of the the litigation on going and all the the money involved im it is a it is a highly newant's topic what what what more would you to talk about opioids i think that most people hereabout the opioid crisis and just assume that they are quotin qover prescribe that people are given opioid drugs as a front line treatment perhaps more than they should that the eddictive component which i understand is very real that the potential ferdiction is very ireal am as well as the potential for am cross interactions with other things alcohol am and perhaps even other elicit drugs the street drugs perhaps af people cannot fill their prescriptions a and tolerance to the opioids creating issues were people that aned more of them there do i have a not close family member but a us distant family member who had his entire life it arranged beautifully is a practising lawyer with a beautiful wife and family had a back injury a was prescribed oxy contin it it helped him initially but then it it set off some behavioural psychological pathways tha had him seeking more forging prescriptions when ihe understood the law he was a lawyer i he eventually went to jail got out the same thing happened again he eventuany ended up debt right and i think there are many examples of that that we hereabout in those ar very salient and very disturbing very saddening i think that most people and clean myself here the opioid crisis and assume that what we really should be doing as seeking a better alternative but what i'm hearing from you is that there are use cases where opioids make a great deal of sense and that they have really helped improve people's lives and that none of what i just describe or anything it as experience by those people in that quite the opposite do i have that right perfectly and and that is again where we we we need to treat these at an individual level on the case by case pasis a and that one size does not fit all a yes opioids were over prescribed i think everybody agrees to that in this country am and we went througha period of time with massive over prescribing andis a lot of new ants and reasons why in large part a physicians we get terrible education around pain and we do not had ta treat it in general coming out a medical school wo get about seven hours of education on pain a vetnerains get forty great if your taking i think your dogs name as castello yet anfortuna he passed but he lungsome pain meds for a short while but i found an alternative treatment that worked far better perfect which turned out to be by the way lodos to stostrone he was castrated he was fixed on air hunger am and i it is interesting ie i've gone i'v ave said publicly on very large skillpod casts that i gave my dog lodos to stostrone later in life and ameliorated a lot of his aches and pains at least from what i understood as he start moving better and feeling better and sleeping better and i expected the vetnary community come after me with pitch forts not one we did that and yet i heard from hundreds of vetinarians it said yes we wish that we could prescribe those sorts of things to people who castrate their mal dogs later in life to ameliate their symptoms a that opened up to me a whole a world of understanding about some of the restrictions that tet that that is fase and turns to what they prescribe there is a whole discussion to be had about that will do a series on animal and health that health great the that is oclier healthy to you get the point now but when it comes to the opioid crisis and this discussion you i think it is become o laden with the idea that doctors are on the take they'r getting paid to give opioids to pations and that is why they are doing that and id i do not believe that necessarily the case but i think that is what the public prerception is that it is all financial here is the here is the thing im were their bad docks doing bad things yes i'm i'm goingto invoke a a good for o min keeth humphreas tat's no ya serific terrific i psychologist who is in eddiction medicine ah psychologist and public policy person and the way he breaks it down and iavs a subscribe to this is ththere is three types of physicions remember there is about a million physicions in this country bout a million im you have got physicians doing the right thing for the right reasons vast majority docs we need to leave them alone we need to support them we need to help them do their job and not put more obstructions in their way there is a much smaller group of docs doing the wrong thing for the right reasons what i mean by that is these are docks who did over prescribe opyoit is in this case in this contec they im did buy in to the marketing messages that were put forward they did not have much education around alternatives intreating pain and they thought by handing out pills just pills ah in their very brief visits with patients remember primary caradocs is my heart goes out to them youd whater they get fourteen minutes or with the pation they gave them something that they thought would help they were doing the the wrong thing for the right reasons but they believe that they were helping they did not awe they were not get catching financial incentives was proken got's right those people we need to educate them we need to train them on proper pain management opjoy prescribeing deeprescribing and then you have got the tiny little group at the top of this if you will pyramid these are a docs doing the wrong thing for the wrong reasons these are bad docks these are your pill mills these are people breaking the lot they need to go to jail and of im the thing is i isa that little group at the top in the millionor sophysicions we have in this country it represent such a small representation but it got blown out by the media and everybody else particularly those docks doing the right thing for the right reasons got caught up in it an engenderd huge amount of fear huge amount of fear on the physicion side and then what happened is the docs just started abandoning pations they cut their patients off i i had a young housewife to young kid s a dock cut her off from a little bit of icet in that she was taken intermittently for am i'm some backpang that had been well managed on this he was doing all the right things cut er off she turned to black tar heroine am california great state of california tried an experiment where they monater death certificates in our state for and the docs prescribing opioids for that and a they went off to the docs thinking that if they targeted the docs doing that it would lead to a reduce a reduction and opio deaths it led to a doubling i know counter intuitive because what happened is the docs abandoned the patiente and we have to be aware of the negative consequence is of this now the current not trying to menimize the opioi crisis cause it is real but we also now need to put some contacts the opiad crisis is being driven by the elicit fentinels tit is more if you have just look at the sedy sedata it is very clear that the fentinels coming an vy a mexico china and others ah is what driving most of the deaths am keith a'm getting back to keith led a beautiful ah lance it stanford commission on the north american opioid crisis and put together very rational plan i just finished serving as a senior adviser to the melcaboar to california will we revised or prescribing guidlanes here they were very draconian before hard limits made people fearful both patience and docks and we have shifted it back over to put the control back in the hands of the physician patient relationship a we are hoping it will make a difference you can see i im i'm going on ta bit here there is there is just huge complexity in this space ah i understand youreging to do an episodunos on some time on it the future and i hope the audience has more opportunity to listen to this other questions i can answer for you that on that i really appreciate the thoroughness of your answer am i think that you set a picture in a contact that i certainly did not understand or appreciate a and it sounds one certainly not the only but one of the major issues is the creation and the propagation of a black market by doctors cutting off patience presumably out of fear am those patients then seeking not any but a elicit for black market routs to treating their pain which you can understand why they would do that i mean i'm not justifying any one doing anything y legal but somebody is in pain and they had something that worked and now they do not theye gon to go looking for things that are similar to that thing and dum you are telling us that fentinel in street drug spasically is what is killing people presumably i doubt it is vent an old prescribed by physicions or perhaps it is it is not no there used to be a bit a confusion around that because phentinel is a prescribed medication in a patch form and in atroch the trose use for end of life cancerpain but unfortunately some of the coting used by the ced ca in otherwises got that confused with the elisan it took a while to get a better handle on it but i think we know we do now yes most of it is being driven by the ffentinels and we are just seeing this incredible epidemic wave of it it can be made cheaply brought across the borders reasonably easily a something we defitly need to to address we want to be careful about not conflating that crisis with the issue of pain which is an epidemic in its own right and for the segment of people who are using opioids responsibly and effectively for their pain a and that is where again that new ants comes in am are ther patients who are also on opioids that have been ween down you can wen them down gently compassionately and they do better a the answers yes ah my partner beth is just finishing up a study on that and showing that with compassionate care a number these patients can be ween down who voluntarily want to come down and sometimes the find their pain actually improves and part of that improvement may be that opioids have degrees of side effects and by elimination of those side effects and the the other aspects there seeing improvement could you list off some of them were a commonly used opioids a morphine and it is a commercial livers a commercial deliberivatives m es contin which is a longlasting version of morphine oxy codone which by itself is a short acting medication but when you incapsolated in a long acting version it becomes oxy contin which was the trade name that produe a put forward a phentinel we mention comes in a patch form ah there are mixed agents li ga tram it all which is a count of a week opoi but also has some a wat' called seratonan and oriproneferand a reuptaken hibition ah we have got delotted which is aversion o a trading for hydro morphone there is a slew there is id a more than twenty different opioids within that list of two hundred medications that we have methodone is another one a people usually think of methodown is a medication used to a treat addiction people go to methodum clenex it is a long lasting opioid and the right person and certain circumstances that con be used effectively for chronic pain a by en large they all have the same or similar mechanisms of actions working on opioid receptors this is getting back to your original question to me about where these things work there are opiod receptors in the prifery there are rich sources of opiod receptors in te spinal cord in the dorsal a the a back part of the spinal cord and then there are many areas in the brain that are rich and opioid receptors it is it is all a naturally occurring area when we put in an opioid my mouth we are binding to those receptors and activating those nerl circuits in many cases when i say activating they have an inhibitory roll i mean that is one of the major parts is there any roll for benzida azopenes in pain relief rarely if to i many of my colleagues would say shon it just a hard know a an drid i'd have to come up with an edge condition of somebody who has a generalized anxiety disorder unpoorly treated with antianxiolitics with chronic pain and the would not you find you treat their anxiety with a benzo at helps with their pain as well but these are ag conditions a fine large know what about cradum i had a am a odd experience with cradum and i've never taken it a the experience was the following i started learning about it hearing about it a from listeners on the podcast realized by doing a little bit of a websearch that it is available over the counter and that certain people to take it often every day it lowdoses or even hirdoses and that there was huge variation in terms of the amount of cradum in the various products and how much people were taking some people talking about cradem as something asas if it were inocuous and we can ask whether not indeed it is inocuous and i put out a a tweat i guess now that twitter is called ex i guess i put out and ex anyway does not matter and i and i said that my a first pass view of the literature on cradum the scientific literature is that you had a lot of property similar to opioids although different as well and that it seemed an ave odd and maybe even problematic that it was widely available and i got bumbarded with a i dont wat to call them cradum enthusiasts because what i soon discovered was that these people am were angry with me for a placing even a partial shadow on cradam but what was interesting to me was that they were saying that in their case and i'm assuming they were telling the truth that cradam had helped them get off prescription opioids and that they heavily rely on cradam in various the levels of dosage am in ways that they felt really helpe them and two things happen one i've been put in the crossairs of the procat cradam community not toit severe extent but perhaps the more important thing is and i wone i thank that community ah in part for now it is inspired me to do a deep dive search on cradam i'm going to be interviewing one of the laboratories that is done a lot of the research on cradam a later and a twenty twenty four but also it it is made me realize that there these compounds thete available over the counter that many people feel passionatly about because they really feel its helped them not saying it hasn' not saying it has not but then again i've never taken it what is cradem at ere perhaps what receptors does it tickle and what re your thoughts about cradam and people using radem and maybe on pronouncing it wrong i've also heard crate home crad i i'm calling it cradem ye a cradem is this natural substance that does have as you said opiodergic a properties as well as others that is not fully understood it is been available wele naturally for many many years brought in to the united states and i've heard the same stories and i just want you to be prepared that anything i say about cradam there is going to be some angry people after this and it is what it is am i have heard the same stories that you have heard about people taking cradem an saying its helping thend to stay off of a prescription opioids or elicidopioids and i get that i think in some way it is binding opiod receptors and reducing the a natral craving for these other substances and it makes perfect sense a methodom does that a pbuperonorphine which i did not mention before bet is a is an interesting opiod that a binds to these receptors and it reduces craving am were i have challenges is en ah just because something is natural does not mean that it is safe we are seeing and increase number of overdoths death's associated with cradam am is it polly substance yan some cases it is but i think there is a lot we do not know polly substance people taen cradem but alsot onga haul a benzofs getting back to the benzas am personally i think we need to put a lot of research into this agent and if it merits that i think it should be a aa prescribe substance i think part of the challenge that we have is that we do not under stand the quality the purity the dose the people are taking of this thing ah similar typofstory with canabas by the way ah iso i'm hoping that we are going to get the research that we need to really understand what it is doing and whether it is safe and effective i'm left with a lot of unknowns right now you mention canabas is canabas effective and by extension is c b d effective for managing pain yet there is another controversyal one you will get a few comments about whatever i say in general listeners of this podgas yes they tell us where there upset theyll also tell us where they agree im re go heres in ever to 'm satisfy everybody but just to some of this lands in in the realm of highly educated opinion am some of it is still as you point out speculations we do not really know what cratum sources people are taking or canabas at cetera but i i think you will find and my experience has been that i'm people appreciate that we are having the conversation and we do read all the comments and those comments often as i mention in my earlier anecdote about that tweat i'm often direct us to explore things further and we can always ave a a second discussion about this down the lines hat we invite all your comments and criticism canabas well here is what we know and carefully controlled laboratory situations canabas has been shown to reduce narropathic pain that is that nerve related pain from people who have either nerve injury a diabetic neropathy a post trapatic narrallege a terrible burning nerve pan condition it has been shown to reduce that in small samples from larger scale epidemiology studies and even larger clenic bay studies that i've done we find it has not been particularly helpful on average compared toe people not on a canabas there is a lot we do not know about the causality of that and the direction of it but all to say that there are im many many questions it remain im i think the challenge that i personally have is that we are running huge population level experiments as we speak right now by ou no providing unfeter id use of canabas and the bad news is is that we are probably gong to see some real untoward consequences of it were already are i'm the good news is i'm hoping that at a state level we will be able to use that data to really in form ah what is going on with canabas i mean some of the challenges or what i refer to acratem a canabas is not canabas is not canabas your headliss emliee e to s d ra shos the dose yes all of that we do not know what you are getting it remains a schedule one drug by the d im i in some of my leadership rolls and others have called for scheduling of it as a schedule too why why not to purposely try to restrict use but by making it a schedule to drug you have now made it much easier to research i do not know if people understand how many barriers there are to scientist studying schedule one drugs could you explain schedule one versea schedule to thank you yet schedule its the scheduling of drugs is a categrization that describes their abuse liability and you have drugs p c p heroine a canabas which are schedule one which are defined is having high addiction potential and no a utility which has almost wild because when i think about p c p f and cyclit n i certinly do not want people run out in starttaking p c p but chemically and physiologically p c p is ever similar to chedamy and u a rarely is ais discussbut chedemine is now a widely used as a theraputic presume ly chedemine is not schedule too a maybe ven schedule three yes ad i some of that the the stuff that is thrown into schedule one makes no sense it is historical it is all is it is decades and decades tago of history and clearly canabats should not be a schedule one handstamp no question a by scheduling it tho you will have this ascital benefit of being able to make it more easy to study and then you get the ani h an the f d an to this and we can start really getting answers to the questions which do i think it works at the end of the day do i think there is some variation of canabast t h c c b d ratios that will provide some benefit oh absolutely there is too many receptors in our brain that are involved with modulation of pain i just do not know what thos are am friend of mind a mark wallas a runs pain at u c csan diego has come up with a really nice recip cocktail of ratios of t h c to c b d that he feels very strongly that he can help people i'm using that as an active agent i know that in a colorado there is a strain of canabus were the it is pure c b d not h c think they call it charlot's web and parents of children with intractable epilepcy will action move to the sta to colorado in order to get it because it seems to be effective for the treatment of certain forms of pediatric epelepsy though a shared with me with one of our colleagues nowan williams when o you gast on the part gess these plantbase compounds have have their place witther nots cratum perhaps right wer that remaining open about that we are canabysts the the tee see or the seebede or some commination thing it is really interesting i think at's laws wre toying about plant compounds how do you view the fields that are what i woed call somewhat adjacent to traditional medicin things acupuncture caerpractic physical therape and forth as a pain physicion a within the field of pain medicine or pain management i think about six broad categories of therapiece that we provide for people with chronic pain one of these is the medications and there is a whole large grup of categories of medications of two hundred or a available too nerve blocks a an procedures these range everything from trigerpoin injuctions to nerve blocks with local inaseticonstairrigt on up to mentmally invase ife procedures sponicord stimulators a implantation of drug delivery pomps three psychological and behavioral therapies pain psychology which has many forms now can be very effective for physical and occupational therape approaches to chronic pain five this is what we we tipually call complimentary alternative medicine approaches it is a little bit of an outdative turn but i think of that is acupuncture neutrasuitacles these are the over the counter agents that have actually shown to haw benefit in pain that you can get over the counter and last and not least six what i call self enpowerment are increasing your agency and here it is about education it is a bo a learning skills it is abw being here on the hureman in a lab podcasts learning about pain a it is it is that self empowerment and what we find is it thos six categoriis all brought together typically have the best benefit for people living with chronic pan to a lot of people listening to us right now then go yet acupuncture i m this is a you thousands or tens of thousands of years practice that clearly is grounded in a lot of clinical data and clearly works and then other people wil go omiginnes the time i acupuncture sticking needles in the body are they just pain treats pain as that what is about but am as you and i both know unless it is being performed a incorrectly acupuncture is not painful to receive does acupuncture help treat certain forms of pain is there any ye litivic basis yes yes there is a do i understand what is going on with acupuncture having completed an acul and an i ach funded acupuncture study i just saw that a published no a yet i'm tat i'm just been straight a we still do not know exactly how acupuncture is working a we do know that there is a nice study that showed ac tivation of perfroladenacine receptors that have a perferal analgesic effect we know that acupuncturing as compared to sham acupuncture engages differingto brain regions it is interesting that many of the acu points overlie perfal nerves and by needling those nerves are we causing a central change were turning down the amplifier if you will in the brain maybe im where does this fit into my clinical use my usual statement is that if you can afford the wallet by opsy give it a try although find a really good acupuncturous i've oh yet yet i've had acupuncture done i ni wound say many times but several times and i wi'll say this im one of the acupuncturous i went to put needles in my face and i ended up having to go to stamford derm to get some of the angiomas that were blood vessel growth that was the consequence of theire needle insertions and to the point where i will not if i go to acupunctuon i do not put anything do not putay needles in my face cause i'll take an angiomon my lagor wetver i do not care and i it is not vanity but i did not the way that the needles were introducing angiomas to my face now that was probably because this acupunctrous was not doing things correctly not saying all acupunctures do that but here is the problem how do which acupuncturous are reliable verss not and for that matter how do whach physician is reliable verss not may i work at an institution stamford where i can ask a lot of people and i still mi i seniour administerers will not this but when i get a recommendation from a dock at stamford i always call somebody you see us f and crosscheck and i do not tell them that i'm cross checking and i'll do the reverse as well when ie when i was at you see sandiego i would check up with stamfords an most people do not have access to that kind of community i mean i can pick up the phone and contact somebody in premuch any medical specialty and at multile institutions but for most people they are waiting into the abyss of acupuncturous of physicians i mean how are people'spliss to navigate this you found a perfect way to do it many of us do the same thing and for those who do not have access to high quality acperts you can use variations of that you are right with acupuncture most the ones i've been associated with e use in the clinic or outside or all have been high quality the recommendation would be to try to get a a referl or recommendation from somebody who refers to that acupuncturous dochs want to have relationships with people with other clinitions that do a really good job we do not want to be refering to somebody whos bad cause it reflects badly on us it is really doing what in a way what you were doing try to connect with your primary care doctor others and get some recommendation am for who is high quality im with regard to clinicians pain physicians for instance that is tough there is five to ten thousand of us that subspecialty trained out there if yeure pain is really complicated a complex payin problem you are probably better off with a turture referl centor that can provide comprehensive services we are possible 's there a is there a centralized website where people can say o ga live in the state of i war i a maynou a lot of our listeners ore over sees or where people can find out the the of the radings based on patient experience although that can be complicated i confess sure the one star at of five star raidings ar erlo bit more salian ther'e been studies on this people tend if you see a negative review those tendograb your attention even if the're fewer of them than the many thousands of positive reviuse but i mean patient should be able to get the information that they want about previous patients experience right ye i got to tell you the a the patient ratings im it is a highly manipulated situation im how well you can pay companies to help jack up your ratings i say that is it is rather eas i see it in the community on on deflation of rate omi yes infellation of raisings and then you inflated and it overcomes any of the negative wans im we have not of taken an approach ah on this and maybe that is naive of us i'm youna we see twenty five thousand patient visits a year and only a tiny percentage of them put some rating and it is probably the extremes undoubtedly but we do not manage it i know that in many communitye settings that they do i did not answer your question is there a reliable source af quality i still think at the end it is gon o be a relationships and word of mouth and referl i do the same thing you do i to see how na watfor the alogist i ask my primary caradoc at san for who is the best who is the person that knows the most about food related issues will some really untrepernurial guyr galler group of guyr gals will put together a websider ind ap or something that really addresses this problem head on wat i's i tthink o a very few things more useful then a truly independent way of understanding prir patient experience and finding the best person for a particular problem and i think a i can help with us but i think a i and human intervace anyway somebody out there should do it am ib curious about car practic for a lot of people gan ca not car practerers let us not talk but the people specifically but caer practic a lot of people put accupuncture and car practic am adjacent to one another but my understanding is that insurance often will cover acupuncture but not car practic work a maybe i got that backwards or mayb em just all out wrong but with car practic work you are talking about often the attempt to relieve a compression of nerves certainly nerves are being manipulated if any part of the body as being manipulated get's manipulates kind of a word that imply something a sinister is happening has bein am adjusted am what re your thoughts about carpracters assuming the carpractor is well trained and responsible can it help pain can it help backpain neckpain whole body pain y first wall a accupuncturous and carpractic or to entirely different profession russjust a just onbe clear for people and they some times get lumped into a similar category af pain treatments and that may bewere a you now that comes from a just closing out on the acupuncture again a just to somrise yes in some patience and some circumstances i've found accupuncture to be useful and it is worth the try see amess a center ifomedicar ah is now paying for acupuncture for people over the age of sixty five a medicare f for medicur patiencs that something recent and a we were happy to see that i believe that was for back pain that should be fact checked ah but coer practic mixed data ah well controlled studies some of shut some have shown thah it can be helpful for low back pain a some have shown it is not it is it is truly not clear a the type of carpractic that involves a the does not involve kind of ean of the the fast high velocity manipulation is a physicion i have some concerns about that particulary around the neck ahi've taking care of patients that have had vertebral artery disections from i'm that rapid wrenching what is a viverty ogery dissection one of the the the main arteries that goes a from the body to the brain in the back portion of it is called the vrtibral artery and ah when you do these high velocity manipulations ah there is a risk i'll be it small of having a disection or an emblis thrown off and i've had lake a stroke it is lhht it is a s a stroke a'm but there is a lot of approaches that can be done that ah in some patients have shown some shown some benefit i think the key with a number of these therapies and i doft want to single lad acu acupuncture or cower practic if you go to them ask yourself an mi getting durable benefit meaning everybody feels good after a missage right but couple few hours later it is cont o worn off s a nice experience in the moment for most people if you are finding that for ac o puncture cour practic or anything for that matter ask yourself is t really providing you durable benefit that is worth the effort a or is it just rapid it feels good in the moment we tend to use that and our clenical practice is a threshold and we to see things at last for a longer period of time and in many of these treatments whether it be accupuncture cour practic we use those as an inroad into more of a functional reabilitative approach a meaning when you get chronic pain you tend to a withdraw you tend to stop ex exercising you stop moving your muscles atrophy you become deconditiond because of the pain and we want to use these tools that we have been talking about is a way to get people engaged in activity to correct the underlying by a mechanical issues that may be present and they all need to be appropriately staged and that is whare working with a good clinition can help with that yet certainly my case any time i've had back pain even when it was very severe provided i was not harmed and i was just hurt a continuing to move and not becoming sedntary was absolutely the fastest ru to recovery and a and in particular doing certain exercises that a that were particular to my my case a what if any is the role for physical therapis in the treatment of chronic pain absolutely crucial absolute crucial ah desmite bing a physician not a physical therapist i've great appreciation respect for what the physical reabilitativ approaches do because at the end of the day we are trying to get people back to an improve quality of life and physical functioning iman that an aught is often what people are most looking for control over their pain control over their life yes reduction and pain but more being able to do more things and there tying in with good physical therapist occupational therapists people who can do a goalsetting a absolutely critical all of the treatments that i provide typically are meant to help support an increase and physical reabilitaive pproaches and when i do nerve blocks or procedures or given medication and if we an it reducing some pain we want a tie that ind with more activity and what the physical therapist ar great particuarly those trained in chronic pain is knowing that difference between hurt and harm they can work with people to know whats safe for them to do to reabilitate they can teach them a more about body ma canics and help improve endurance in strength they can work around pacing pacing is critical for people with chronic pain now this is not just exclusive to the physical therapis the psychologist do pacing i do pacing what is paing here is the problem with chronic pan one of the many problems it waxes and wans and what happens as youe go ought nto have a good day you go out gangbosters and you go do everything that you have not been able to do for the last week because you have been in pain and thend you pay the price and when you pay the price you are back in bed or you are on the couch and you are not moving and what happens is you go in to this roller coaster of activity and no activity at all and what happens is it an trains in our brain it is a classic negative reinforcement model this is classic psychology and then people become fearful of more movement and as a consequence they get more and more i'm disuse a atrophy and then more disability the key what o you do about that the key is you set small goals baby steps if you can walk comfortably for a block right now great walk that block to morrow maybe walk a block plusan nextra fifty feet and theye the next day another fifty feet no more no more if you have not a great day do not go do five blocks youre training for a marathon you are training for the long win now what is goin to happen along the way is it you areging to have good days and you are goin have bad days on the good days do not go out and exceeded set a threshold time it on your watch at a distance on the bad days recognize we all have bad days everybody has bys and you may need some rest during those bad days but then the next day get up and restart where you were and that is a type of thing a physical therapists good pain psychologist good physician can help you with and tying that in by the way with these are ther therapies ry interesting i've never heard of pacing but it makes total sense and i can see how people wit really hinder their own progress without that basic understanding which thanks you we now have and it is something that hofully all these the reputic modalities keep in mind i'man i do not know whethere not the acupuncturists or talking to the a physical therapists are talking to the physician but i guess this is the reason for refurrals right why somebody has a primary care dock than t than it and a radiates down to a the rest is that on in in an ideal you t opian world that is exactly it i mean outside a a comprehensive pain centers that have all of the stuff colocated you are dependent on a dock to play quarter back a and bring all those referls together it is credibly challenging for a a primary cerdoc to do that with the limined amount oftime theyare given to see af person a this is what we are trying to use technology to to help better with that inegration and i i do think there is hope for the future will have better ways of managing that in handly it what is your view on non prescription compounds called supplements or nuture suitacles for the treatment of pain fascinating topic this country's rather unique in having a a wide slew of over the counter agents that are actually am prescription in europe and another countries and there are over the counter agents that have been shown to be effective for a number of pain conditions for neropathic pain a seetalalcarnatine is one of them a seetalal carnatine is thought to work on a myticondreal metabolism and and prove mytichondreal health an is been used i believe is a a anti aging may be even a cognitive enhancement agent a you nequ and it is been studied out of an australian study i think it was called tho sydney trials a actually and what they found it is one of the few over the counter agents that actually had disease modifying property's meaning they studied this in diabetic neuropathy the clinical en point was not pain reduction the clinical inpoint was nerve conduction velocity changes and that is how we monitor nerve health is and a normal nerve they move nervalpulses move at a certain rate and when they are injured from dibetes they say it is much slower and you lose signal this actually improve nrve health you can by those at a viteman shop a order them on line a alphalipoic acid is another one alphalipoic acid at least two mechanisms one is it is a free radical scavenger and second a that is been more recent is it is a t type calcium channel modulator and calcium generals or in our nerves and it ta turns those down and it can have some benefit for neuropathic pain om people have taken alphalipoic acid for a general sense of well being and it is generally well tolerated it can cause a little bit of stomach upset i will tell you i took this one myself for a while and this is oginjust an end of one what i found though is you have t type calcium channels in your heart an i do hit a high intens at interval training and i was finding i could not get my heart reight over a hundred fifty i had i stopped it a that is not a adverse event that is just an annoyance but that is useful a videem in see if you are going in for surgery and it is a may be a nerve related surgery tha you are ging to have they found vitom in see prophyloctically can reduce the likelihood of having certain nerve pain conditions after srgery fish oil of the omaga threes have been found to be a beneficial around chronic pain i more recently the dat to here is on smaller numbers creatine which i imagine you have probably talked about it at at some length but creatine has shown in small pilot studies some benefit in fibra my alga and some other a types of conditions there are a number of these substances that are backed up beyon the a the anec data that wed joke about the anecdotal there is actually good randomize control trials and this is something that people can i easily take advantage of i just be mindful that just because it is natural just because it is over the counter does not equait with a hundred per cent safety meaning get educated about the side effects in the adverse events get educated about the drug drug inter actions the agent agent interactions and for instance there are these over the counter agent some of which am you want to be careful of and not taking when you are going into surgery because they can be a platelet inhibitors and they can cause you to bleed more is not viteem in se one such coma substance that that causes a accessive bleeding or or some people report that high levels of omega threes can increase the can reduce the viscosity of the blood meaning you bleed easier the the omga threeis officihoils yes absolutely the vitemen see i'm not familiar honestly with that is a blood thing ageint maybe i i'm a mis informed there are more maybe i'm just forgetting it but that is that is one i do not usually think of is a the blunt thener some one will put in the showto comments one way or the other i gat corrected iy i but there is a number of these over the counter agents that are a therre available the vast majority or inocuous that i've mentioned that i've mentioned there are worsh meaning they they do not a cause harm at the at reasonable dose is a but they cannot have positive effects well a perfectly state ye w think you for sharing that list i think s you mention a many compounds that heire only ovailable pi prescription oversees are are indeed ovailable over the counter in the you ask in this area untresutacles they ga supplements is still anarrya that is actively debated if anyng on people's stance but it is refreshing to hear somebody whose ya a a formerly trained physician and a mnpscientist to a embraces many different approaches ind in the treatment of pain along those lines a perhaps you be willing to talk about the psychological treatments that can be effective for pain again absolutely critical in the management of people with you a wide range of pain problems and recall what we talked about is ou know this is no susception these are the signals coming up to the brain once it hits the brain word dealing with everything that person is lived through and also is currently experiencing meaning their levels of anxiety depression how they cope with pain in the past how they cope with it now a early a life experiences is a paper that just came out in a jama a little in the last few days where they did a metanalysis of brain imaging studies on people with early adverse life events and what they found is abnormaladies an emotional processing emotional functioning and people who have these a giving strong evidence that what happens toyou early in live impacts us is adults and stays with us it changes are wiring now this is where in part pain psychologists behavoraltherapist can come in they can help with the sum of the a maladaptive coping the the thought processis involved with pain they can help teach skills for the vast majority o pain psychology this is not your typical psychoanalytic lying on a couch in a talking about whatever this is about teaching people skills a incredibly helpful ah does it eliminate pain a few of the things that we do actually eliminate pain ere trying to do is chip away little bit with this medication a little bit with this perceit somedof this procedure bit with psychology were trying to hit all of these pathways inaggregate ah to make a real difference the pain psychologis use classically technique psychognative behavor altherapy which involves often recognizing these unhelpful thoughts and patterns that we all get into around pain and even life to interrupting those thoughts to helping people again with gualsetting and pacing to teach people relaxation techniques through deep breathing a things bile feed back im in selicon valley where i practice the engineers love the bile feet back i'm an engineer by formal trainings i get it but it is that closelup feed back because remember the the brain is controlling the peripery and controlin the sympathetic nervous system and when we are in pain our sympathetic nervous system gets rept up when the sympathetic nervous system gets rept up blood vessels constrict a heartwrate goes up or muscles get tense am and we need sometimes ways of learning how to calm down that sympathetic nervous system a cogna behavour al therupe mindfulness basedress reduction acceptance an commitment theropbeor some of the tools that they use my partner beth has developed a brief intervention called empowered relief yes i'm bias am it works we have studied this and an an aatha funded study in its a way of getting eight weeks of cogn behavoural theropean two hours well not ment to replace c b t but as an additional tool and you aregoing to see is time goes by more and more these tools come out in the beauty of them is the're going to be much easier to disseminate broadly to the public then for instance a pill and i cannot we cannot just go put in to fedacs or the oas post office yet a strut sending up pills t everybody but we can develop treatments on line that a can teach people skills and really help is that the plan for this abbreviated but equally effective cognan behavioral theraby yes now you are getting into ccount of my beth's and my life mission and i've spent the last twelve years diit building a addigital platform a health platform that we have integrated into clenics and capture high quality data covering all aspects of people's physical psychological social functioning and the reason for that is to address a critical need that we have on better quality date about people the data and the information that we have on people with pain and many health conditions is terrible and i created this platform to be able to capture high quality day to put it to use usa i in the background for prediction and now beth has created the brief interventions which we are integrating and the notion is to make that widely available for free we are giving it all the way yes said this is a life mission we both have been blesse to be at standford where we have everything but you go just thirty miles forty miles outside of the ba area and you are in a health cared desert and i do not say that disparaging to any dock's working out there but it 's different there is only a handful of large academic saners and large practices in the country but you get outside those in those catchment areas people struggle with how to get good quality care you asked that question earlier how do you find good quality care and we are working to make that that available to everybody fantastic i was going to ask you as a final question what is your if you had one wish for the future of pain medicine and the treatment of pain what that would be am before you answer that am i'll just add an answer that you already gave which is it sounds the implementation of this a incredible set of tools and database that you have am collaborated with doctor d'arnell but darnel to a to develop is at least one of them now that that am that answer was given by me then you can it frees up a the opportunity for you to give another answer what is the if yu had one wish for the feel the pain medicine a going forward what wwuld that wish me yes a few years ago an i coled for the country the development of the national painstrategy and this was a sponsord by the aniatian health in human services and i colet this with doctor linda porter from the nniate we brought together eighty a national experts and pain research pain clenical care pain policy and people woutd lived experience with pain we put together a strategic plan for the country on how to enact o cultural transformation and change the way we assess a care for people with pain how we educate professionals how we communicate with the public my wish would be for full implementation of the national painstrategy it unfortunately a took back seat when it was released the same time with the sedy sopiod guide lines and the opio guide line sucked all the oxygen out of the room but the the strategic plan it was well thought out it is the one that we have for our country it is noncontroversial non partisan it is motherhood an apple pye an and it is if we just actually inplement what we put forward it will make a huge difference in the lives of people a living with pain is there anything that people listening to this pod gasking due to tryind move the implementation of that initiative up it ar their congress people to call i mean the zows that is how i learned enguneor high school in high school a what little i attended and by the way go to school folks i had to catch up a lot but i do remember them saying that this was a democracy is a democracy and that am those fhone calls in letters can often matder for what a gets sent up the flagpol and wh ultimately gets approved an implement ad beautifully stated you are you are absly writing in fact the nied us for the national painstrategy originally came abowed through a number of concerned citizens with pain doing that very thing and lobying what became a byh partisan you do not hear that much any more byh partisan effort im to put fort a nationald pain care act they god put in to the affordable care act that called for the development of an institute a medicine report on pain tha led to the national painstrategy all starting with concern people making those fon calls and writing those letters that means calling your congressmen and congress women leaving messages i hear this works i mean i know people theye doing this for other inisiatives am and one call two calls does not make much of a difference but that if people are saying am this is important to them that people did not power eventually start taking action the the legislators they listen and and in part am again part of this life mission both to develop this platform i've created a non profit i'm called pain you essay and its main mission is to help advance the implementation of the national painstrategy and baked within that is this platform also to use high quality data to better in form the care of patience of people with pain and to deliver high quality im treatments cause we do know also that people listen to data and we need good quality data to influence o those messages but please yes make those calls write those letters it does work el shn doctor matkie thank you much for everything that you are doing you took us on quite a tour am in terms of depth an breadth of the thing that we think of in it unfortunately in some cases experience as pain although we also learned its highly adaptive in some cases can protect us does indeed protect us thank you for taking us on that tour of the biology the psychology the various treatments the context in which all of this exists we touch into some somewhat controversial areas but i really appreciate the thoroughness an the new aunts and the sensitivity with which you touch in to all of those issues and a just one behalf of myself and everybody listening i really want to thank you you am contributed a great deal to day to the public education of what pain is what it is not and how to treat it thank you ever much thank you doctor huverman i appreciate the opportunity to come

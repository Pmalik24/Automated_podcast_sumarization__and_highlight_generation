well we have a rule when it comes to media coveriage of massshootings in the united states if the massshoting can somehow be linked to a right wing cause then we must question this intire conservative infor structure in the united states if somebody cantengentially be linked to a conservative show or to a conservative politicion we have to questsion the very premises of conservatism itself because obviously every terrible iteration of right wing ideology is telescoped into some evil wite to premisis shooter for example if however a masshooter is a left winger then it is probably gun or its depression of some sort or maybe it is mental illness this is the way the math works o we have the latest iteration of this particularly stupid narrative device to day the new york post talks about an attempted shooting at joll ostines packed huston area megacurch on sunday the person who did the shooting previously pend antis metic writings had recorded history of mental health issues and used a weapon with a free palistine sticker in the braz an attack not only that this person identa is a woman identified as a man this person called herself jeffrey nas person did have a history of mental illness according to the authorities this person was put under an order for emotional detention which means that officers transported her to a medical facility in twenty sixteen because she was deemed danger to herself or others but then the person was let out i do not mention the name of massshooters on the show because mashurs are typically looking for some sort of notorieties this is a rule that i have it is maybe the one thing that i can do as a member of the media to try to decrease the amount of masshootings in the united states for example do not give all sorts of attention to the name of masshurr make the mashuter more famous but effectively the shooter entered liquag church just before a spanish language service was due to begin at two pm by the way this woman carried along her seven year old son and then open fire as hundreds of people were taking their pus too off doty officers working security at the church return fire and fatally shot this person the young boy to stand a gun shot wound to the had was caught in the cross fire first things first the huston p d first had to determine what pronoun to call the shooter because this is haw stupid our society is now we have a masshure who tries to kill hundreds people at a church and the first question is how can we treat this massshooters gender delusions with respect here is the huston p d then ran an entire investigation to figure out exactly which pronouns to use she utalize both male and female names but through all of our investigation to this point talking with individuals interviews documanes uston polese department reports she has been o identify this entire time as female she her and we ar identifying her as gensemaramale hispanic female we we sertaintly must on take all proper care to ins sure the people attempt to mure other people are called by the genera pronouns they themselves selected but we do have a spate of shootings by people ar trans i dentified in the united states thi sfate of shootings if it were any other demographic group in the united states particularly filer white young men thand we would have all sorts of questions about the evils of young white men from the media butt if they are trans than the shootings just disappear off the front pages immediately the colorado springs it shouter identified as non binary as many cohnson points out that den virsuter identified tos trans the abrdene shulder identified as trans and famously the nashval shooter at a church school identified as trans now i thinkg that it is worth while here to also point out that this particular shooter was a radical left winger who had a free palistine sticker on her gont this particular church happen to be attend did by a largely pro israel audiences and it is also worth pointin out again how the narrative process t works for example when a few months back three muslem american university students were shot in vermont the entire media went bazerk suggesting that this must have been some form of right wing attack on muslem students this was state of his lamaphobia and this of courses because the media were trying to establish at the time a parallel between quonnin what is lamaphobia in the united states and antisematism in te united states which is radically spite and this culminated in the president of the united states issuing a statement from the white house in which he said gill and i were horrified to learn that three college studens of palestinian descend two of hom our american citizens were shot saturday in burlington vermont we join americans across the country in praying for their full recovery and we send our deepest endolencis t their families while we are waiting for more facts wou know this there is absoly no place for violence or hate in america and then this of course turned into a brader story about as lamaphobia in the united states sthe reason why jobidon put out a statement on this particular shooting their lots a shootings in te united states every single day particularly in place chicago but this one drove attention from e whitehouse because it backed a particular narative now turns out that that narrative actually did not work because the shooter in this particular cases actually had expressed support for hommass in the paste this person again had a history of mental illness and the person also tbecause of that history of mental illness happened to support some pretty terible people ratically anti israel and t that story just natically disappeared from the headlines the reason i point this out is because every time you see a shooting and the media declare whether the shooting is a national story or a local new story look for the narrative and tells you exactly where the media are on every single issue the media are pro trans and th mediar anti israel and because they are protrans inanti israel this story will be disappeared it never happened we will pretend that the ideological motivations of this person absolutely do not matter and the media will then revert to a mental illness check on the person now again mental illness i thin it is a plausble exclanation for this person but the media couldn' have realize this person had a mental illness problem antil this person actually participated in shooting segond the media's narrative structure is undefeated narrative above fact every single time for ar wonderful folks in the medio wit is more on this in just one second first we are experiencing a lot of globlan stability as we plunge into primary season howare you protecting your family in the midst

ninety eight to day can meanwhile massive debate has now broken out in congress over the passage of ninety five billion dollar bill that provides some sixty billian dollars in support to u crane and provides another fourteen billion dollars for israel's war against commoss and then ten billion dollars for supposed humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones including polistinians in gaza this thing passed seventy to twenty seven ar seventy to twenty nine in a vote in the senate last night with eighteen republicans voting along with the democrats in favor of passing this particular bill the re publicans verse plunter on that split almost down themiddl in terms of who voted for bill who voted against the bill and there are few reasons for this one is there is a much abadstuffon the bill there is no question even if you support ad tu crane even if you suports ad to israels bunch bad crapinth bill the biggest piece of garbig in th bill is this ten billiaon dollars in humanitarian aid for polistinians in gaza distributed by whom handed out to whom why should american tax pare dollars be sent to a place tat will be then run presumably by the u n r w a or by homass or by some other agency that acts on behalf of terrorists matztus one problem with the bill but the're plenty other promis with te bill and one of the questions about the amount of ou crane aid is what is the u crane aid four and this raises abroader question about exactly what the gols of the united states are in u crane and what the united states is hoping to forestall for aditional aid to u crane his a broader scaleform policy question first rule of foreign policy a first rul of foregn policy foreign policy is about preventing the worst outcome very often using the second worst outcome foreign policy is a series of bad choices that you have to make and oneof the problems with doing foregn policy is that if you are successful in a forein policy context thend what you typically have done is you have fore stalled the counter the counter factual for example let us say that the united states instead of going isolationist after w ld were one thad remained rilitively interventionists and had built up its military power and said to the germans in gjapanese were not an allow you to get agressive and world wore to it never happen wel the cretique would have then been why is the united states spending much money on its military when there is no war only the counterfactual allows you to understand what could have happened if not for particular interventian or particular action tht's why hine sate is always twenty twenty in foreign policy because the reality is that whatever choice youre making right now you have to try to imagine outside your box it is very easy to say in two thousand in two that the american military drawtown in the nineteen nineties and the perception of weakness by america's enemies led to nine eleven and that is clearly true n ther pople make that argument at the time but the argment on the other side ofthe time was why we spending much money on the military when the us s are has just fallen there is no actual reason for it when it comes to every foreign policy tobate we have to understand what exactly is the goal is the goal in ucrane to for examples grade the russian military which by the way is something i think is worth while beas i believe that the the russian military thas been used for expansionis purposes and is working hand and glove with chinese military and that both of them provide threats ranging from naval orena two to ground assaults in various places in eastern europe for example to place ti one e butt let us let us talk about what are the americangulls to grade th ussian military would presume liby one two would be provent the russians from taking over all of ucrane and then threatening in natofs borders because ucrane is not act a gine chunk of the land mass to rectly in the middle of eastern europe it wors poland it wor is hungary weres a bunch of important states the taking of u crane would also provide impetus four russia presumably to try to attack one of the outlying states lithuania in the baltics because the russians actually dufyoulokat amap hold they pieces of territory on the egulithlania call colinan grad which is to be known is origionally germantaritory nown as conigsburgs were a manual contlass from the oretically that could incentivize the russians to move into lithalania eucrane happens to be the bred baskket of the world huge moun of grane is produced there eucrane also happens to provide quyessence in the blacke in way of the russian domination of the lackyuedop ther bunch of geo political and strategic and economic reasons that you do not want the russians taking over all of you crane if the two american goalls are to grade the ussian military specifically because the russians have been expansionis and to prevent them from taking over all of all of ou crane those are american gulls that ave largely been a cheese at this point maybe if the goal is to push russia out of don bas ind crimia that is not going to happen ind petty much everybody understands that is not going to happen to the big question for the u crane aid is is this aid being sent to u crane it is military aid which means honestly s begin tiust american military spendins we spend money by giving its ucrane ucrane than spend down american military contractors to build up all of the military credibility that we actually require it actually gets the machine working and you think the world is about to come a much more violent place which i do suching not terrible thing th you have more money pouring into the systems that sort of grease the wheels of the american military conclext in frms o being able to produce weaponry for use against further thrats likes a china invading t i want but put all that aside if the if the money for you crane is designed to prevent the full take over of you crane then that is the amout of money that we should be spending money crane that is what is in americ's interest if that money is being given to you crane in the bazar assumption that that will low for the full scale re conquest of don bas and crimia that is stupid and is ont going to happen no one has made clear at this point exactly what the aid is for this a signal failing of the biding administration really is it is more on the suggest one second first let us face it your bank it sok i not bank you us but i do know that it kennissoks that is why you need currents currnts build card is the secured credicard the let us you use your own money to build your credit ait basiclly functions a debit card but rather than borrowing money you do not hav and getting dinged wit th twenty five percent interest the every time you do you use your own money and improve your credit score as you do they are been times where we are really low on the creditcard years and years ago and it is deeply uncomfortable well you do not have to do that you might not think building credit is very important right now trust me it is when you go to by car or a house the first thing they do is asked fear credit score you need to start building your credit the best way to do that is with current current is more affordable accessible innovative banking system the help you better spend save in manager

see and crussorrbank membr afty i see for full terms and conditions visit currents i come or call eight eight eight if i've one eleven seventy two for more in formation the're a couple of big battles that broken out one on the democraticside one on the republicanside the battle on the re publicanside is a almost tripe hart type battlethere is three positions on the republicanside with regard to you crane position umber one is the position that i take which is that effectively speaking it is in the interest of the united states to prevent a full scale russian take over of you crane but it is not in the interest of the united states to prolong the war only to grant the false assumption that you crane is going to take control of donbasand crimea and s weu should seek an all frampile also preserving you cranes independence against the russians that happens t be the henry cisteng your position i've been take naposition since i believe april of twenty twenty too two months into the war tis my been my consistent position at no point for example have i suggested the you cranians invade russian territory at no point of i even suggested that there is a possibility the ucranians would take back crimeo or the donbas at no point if i suggested that thereoght to be american boots on the ground there shuld nopy i've not even suggested ther should be inmerican no fliesone over you craneso the position that i've taken is americas he interests are promoted by preventing the russians from taking all of you crane but they already were in control of the donbassan crimia and tht's probably nockling reverse itself that is position number one position number too is the position that jobiden seems to be taken kind of which is that we should just in an open ended way grant aid to you crane for anything they want will let them decide the offram i thnk is an idiotic position why exactly should you crane tecside the offramp an fact laudamers lensky the presidents of you cranes ectually trapped he is trapd because he cannot tell his own people who want back the donbassan crimea that he is going to stop the war short after a full skill invation of his country yeuactually does not have the ability to go back to his own parliament and whoise own people and say ive want an offram pere and i'm an a let them keep donbassam no let them ku crimia which means that it is action in the united states is interest if it could anagan i'v ben saing this fre for almost two years of this point it is in the interest of the united states actually if they could go negotiate a separate peace with ladimer pooten thot guarantee the future security of you crane american security guarantees western security guarantes and also acknowledge that russias going to maintain control of the donbass region as well as crimia and there is the bided in posit ion which is baseally uok a blankcheck do what you want money push hard maybe'll got the nonbass fack maybeoll get crimeabat and i've always thought tht as a stupid position because the american people do not have taste for that nor really should they caus hit really is not in americ's interest and then there is the third position and the third position has not ben clearly articulated but it has been heavily implied and that position seems to be that you crane ought too be fully ruled by russia that russia actually should win in keeve that russia should actually take over all f you crane and install a pupi dictator in ou crane and it is unclear to me ind a lot ofthe form polt that or the very least that the united states does not have any interest if russia takes over all o you crane theoretically ages hu coud say their for positions there is a full isolate isolationist position which as we should not care about anything that happens outside the borders of this country which again i think is consistent but i think short sighted because the reason we do foreign policy in this country is not because it is a fun thing to do on the side is because foreign policy has significant ramifications for americans it has ramifications an frms of security at has ramifications ins from sof economics and has ramifications ans frms of resources thei're lots of ramifications to form policy but ou' say thei'r for positions i suppose one full isolation ism should not care anything that goes on anywhere in the world bring everybody back home wall on all of our borders and that is it i do not thnk that is a a possible solution but that is one position position number too is that for some odd reason ladimer pooten would be better running you crane than the curent government of you crane and not only to we have no interest in stopping pooten we actually should effectively pull out of you crane with our money and allow you crane to fall in the interests of fostering a broader peace with ladimer pooten position nmber three which is my own is we should stop ladmerapoons from taking all of you crane but we should acknowl edge the realities of the situation on the ground and we should acknowledge that don bassan crimea are not going to be taken out russian hands and position number four is the bidin position which is sort of open ended poor money and hope tht you crane can take back everything those of the four articulated positions and republicans seem to be split butween these for positions when it comes to u crane and meanwhile jobidon has not even ar ticulated what the sixty billion dollars is four is the sixty billion dollars design for his enslek quonn't quat liberate the donbassin crimea or is it designe for what is look for an offramp while we freezs the lines of conflict he is not made that clear ands that is opened up a weird debate in which no one will actually state their position on ou crane a gy honest to god do not know the position of many members of the senate on u crane if not grantsing you crane the aid means that keive falls to pouten are you o kay with that or is what you are saying maybwhat you sing is this we do not actshould think heev s gon afall the pouten we want a grants enough aid to prevent that but were not con to prevent four looking aid that is essentially designe for hu manitarian purpose is or it is designe to shorp the economy of ou crane or its designed to take the don bassback were ot gorenot can to any of that because no one is clarifying their positions that this entire thing is incredibly mudy and the same thing by the way is happening on the democratic side of the isle because they do not know what their position is with regard to pouten and ou cranes there is all sorts of confusion with regard to u crane meanal on the israel side of this particular policy you have an isolation is right which is increasingly arguing that there is something bad and immoral about supporting a democratic ally of the united states in destroying a terrorist group the dis murdered twelve hundred citizens of their country and took two hundred hostages including one hundred who are still being helding captivity there is that isolation strite the believes that and much more im portantly there is a large block of the left that seriously sympathizes with actual palistinian terrorism and those folks our sort of voting on the same side when it comes to israel aid with regard to commass in other words form policies a mess right now the clear lines that used to exist with regard to sort of foreign policy positions are completely collapsing and when people make arguments you see my johnson the speaker of the house he put out a statements on the passage of the ucrane aid in which he said house republicans were crystal clear from the very beginng of discussions and he called national security supplemental legislation must recognize that national security beginsthat are on boarder and then he makes the case that border has to be included in this particular act border was rese stripped out of that act becaue the senate could not come up with anything workable thete republicans were willing to indors for good reason republicans should not indorse what democrats want on the southern border and let usi be realistic about this what is happening on the southern border is not a question of money in really's not a question of funding it is a matter of the political will power to tie the hands of the executive branch in enforcing the southern boarder i say this as tomen who just went down of the southernbor and produced to full documentary about the southern boarder and who spent time with the head of the boarder patrol union and who spoke in boar patral officers you spokle the senators i promise you the probment the boarer is no t lack of funds the problem at the border is lack of will that is a very different thing another words when mi johnson says we cannot fun you crane or israel tbecause of what is going on thbort that that is it is complete nonsequeter make the argument that the bill on you craneade is bad on its own merits that it gives too much money to the wrong places or mae the argument that the bill for israel aite is bad on its own merits asit gives ten billion dollars for example to the palisinians and gosa most of which will be sucked up by terrogroups make those arguments but whan i'm seeing is a lack of clarity with a the a wide variety of these issues in which it is unclear exactly what every one even wants and that is confusing to me that is confusing to me ill get's more on this in just one second first let us say you are a highly skille assassin that inherited man dolorian besk are steel from your late father but's alls to say you were hire to go out to the dune sease and makesure a fou prisoners saw their fate into a sarlack pit quickly you realize your

could sav that is policy genius dot com slashi pero meanwhile the republicans are making some claims about this this particular bill that i actuall do not think hold water there is a claim thit is being made about you crane bill that because theou crane bill includes funding for you rane that stretches into twenty twenty five that iis somehow an impeachment procedur now lisen i oppose both impeachments against donal trump they did not a lege high crime to misdemeaners and it is a love everything that trump did in is conversation ith vlodmarsolensky asking solensky to investigate hunter by n in berisma in order to recognize that that did not rise to level of high crime and mis demeaner that was an ipeachable offence the claim right now that is being made is the because the funding to ou crane extends into twenty twenty five an hit is just useful for purposeis a fact checking that because of that that is the predicate to an impeachment push that basically the first impeachment of donal trump was rooted in donal trump saying to lodmer's lensky i'm not going to give you the supplemental aid that has been allicated o your country i'n chill you in vestigate brisma because hou with held the aid impeachment went forward thus a new bill that allicates aid to you crane puts trump at risk of impeachment if you with holds the aid to you crane that does not follow the actural ration olt for the impeachment to be fair was not just the trump was holding up the aids you crant if you would said you cran is corrupt i do not think as a forgn policy matter we should be giving that aid to a corrupt contry om not doing it that would not be im peachable in anyway shap perform i ngenthing democrats oud a tried to impeach on that basis the argument that simply by alicating aid in the future t wen trump could be pressenent that is can of the preticate for ompeachmen i i do not think that diargument holds bperticularly lotrwoir i think that a gait there ar good arguments against the bill i do not think that happens to be one of them o ka all of this meshes with again this brouder foreign policy tebate inside the republican party right now and that was brought to the for a lot of this by the interview the tucker did with ladmarpoutent tucker carlson of course when over to moscow wher he interviewed ladmer pouten we covered that pretty extensively on the show we went through the interview again i thought the tucker to a fine chob and asking questions that a lowd gladmare putent to talk and the question with any interview sor of what is the goal of the interview tucker asked a a series of questions thet were not desine to be confrentational that were not designe to to be aggressive agains lander and that is totally fine the're allowed to do an interview that way when the goal is to alow the dictator to speak for himself said everybody can see what he says an what he thinks and even moments where it looked tucker was trying to elistit a particular response puent an't go for it ain to be perfectly friend with i think that poten ble a massive opportunity i think that if pouten had come out and made the case that i've seen many people on the right make which is you crane is sort of a left liberal country and that when you fight for the ou crane flag your actuil fighting for the eld you be hu flag or that the entire to bockel that is been happening in you crane is the result of american foreign policy elede establishment types i it that would ave ben the argument that that pouten could ave made that i think woutd have drawnwore ieballs instead he went into his actual tro ration ow which was this sort of long historic explanation of why ou crane ought not exists and why he ought to take the whole thing i will i mean the argment ha he makes leeds conclusively to te conclusion that he real that he really really believes that rush up should be the ruler of you crane puriod full stop and that that was the case that he was making he try to back off of that when he sai oll maybe there will be an offram but then he refused to suggests or of in actual realistic mechanism for an offrem and listen i'm somebody who is warm to an offrap if you would present that one ight to th united sate houl jump on it right now o ka butt that is the interview the tucker did with with pouten but it it elicited questions about what tuckers believes are with regard to gladmar poutent because again this foregn policy debate thats happening inside the right is really kind of fascinating right now and i think it is worthy of elucidation and i think agin tucker's a veri articular person and he articulates a point to view on form policy with which i heartily disagree i've invited tucker on the show to discuss it hopefully he will take me up on that iwould iwould love to have a conversation with him about that to clarifi positions i thinkn be good for the movement wellget tom oron this in just once second first if you have not had black rifle coffee yet now is thebast time to tried for yourself i'm saying that because i am deeply reliin ton black rifle coffee my kid's gett me up too early a work in n too late it is the coffee keeping me

code chipiro that is black rifle coffee dot calm with promokode chipiro in any case tucker was at the world government summit induby with an egyptian journalist named emod eldin adib a anta and one of the clips that he that he stated during this interview kannawen viro and it wen by rol because it is a vocative it is aftu not even remotely the most contrversial thing that tuckar said now gen tucker's interview of pouten i'll sayt again i've no propmatucker's inruthpootoni think anybody should beable to talk to any dictator at any time and ask any questions they want and i did not find tucker's questions to be particularly bad i thought that that some of tuckers questions prertigoate the end about avengersquitch weret were quite good e but tucker's conclusions are ones that have real implications for the republican party becaus again what i'm seeing in this debate over the u cranebill i'm not as interested in the ou crane aid bill itself as the foreign policy debate over what that means is the re publican party moving in direction in which it effectively says that the united states should not have aform policy nd should be totally isolationist or is the republican foregn policy establishment moving in direction that says that people vladmer pouten ought to have more power because the united states is actually a bad forse in the world which is even stronger argument and almost horseshooe theories with with burny sanders there is a part of the libertarian right that horse shooe theories all the way around mets nom chomps gown the left is that what what is being articulated on the right or's its sort of a foreign policy realism which is sort of where i sit opposing some wars for example in libia suggesting foreign aid to some countries that are american allies and or toachieve american interests and then of course there is sort of the the old er school mid two thousands neel conposition which is that the united states should be involved in av ast variety of wars whether or not it is in america's interest cannal will sonian perspective on forein policy in which america has to preserve morality in the world at the cost of blood an treasure wether or not is in direct america's interest those are those of the open lines o debate nd i think tucker's interview in duby sort of brought these to the for 's again he is being interview by an egyptian journalist name emod e l dan adi and here is the clipptin when virel it is him talking about poohton and moscow itself en in capable person could not do that he is very cpeoplele on many if hmen that what was radicalizing very shocking and very disturbing for me with the city of moscow were hat never been the biggest city in europe thirteen million people and it is much nicer that any city in my country i had no idea my father as been all of time there and the eities when you work for tyeu wass government an barely had electricity and now it is much cleaner and sae fer and prettier esthetically it is arcitecture it is food it is service thend any contry in cityn the nited states the havin this is nomideological how did that hppen how did that happenand it is scertain point i do not think the average person cares is mosco about abstractions as about the concrete reality of his life and if you cannot use your subway for example as many people are afraid to in your citytets is too dangerouse you have nota sort of wonder is not that the ultimate measure of leadership the alsmen measure of leadership in other words is that moscow's clean while the ar city is dirty cet well there a few things it play here one i totally agree with tucker when he says that ther're many cities abroad that are better run than american cities there is no question that is the cate i been tha many more beautiful cities than any cities that i've seen in the united states iu hare'some eaely beautiful cities in the united states they'ls have pretty seemi underbellies i bin that there can a smaller cities that i thin are wuat beautiful charleston south carolina ther're bigger cities that have e areas that are beautiful boston but some other areas theare really really notnice i spent most o my life in big american cities los angelis which turn from a fairly nice place liv into a very bad place slips and when tucker says that for example law an order matters in major american cities that of course is for sor true but when he uses that as he standin for the russian model of governments that' when isar s have some questions and maybe did not mean that i do not know but it seems when he is saying that it radicalized him why would moscow radicalize you exactly a tucker's always been a lown orr guie tucker's always wanted for example broken windows theory applied in places new york or washington do c n tuckeras over pro grime or something he is never liberal on tese issues but what exactly radicalized him to dit did aradicalize him to a different idea about how government works wen he says abstractions are less important than how you lived life on the grount abstractions our kind of im portant depending on what abstractionsyou are talking about if those abstractions are for example liberty in the american model verses say the russian model where liberty really does not exist and this is where the other clips from tucker from this interview i then are more evocative of maybe what tucker means then then this clip right here by the way it should be noted at this point moscow i've never been there i'll take tuckers word fort and the word many other people that it is a beautiful city we should also points out at this point that the gd peopler capitat in russia is twelve thousand dollars per year only seventy seven per cents of the russian population even has indoor plumming all the wealth get sucked in to moscow whereit is widely distributed among people who are friends of pouton and friends of the friends of booton the mmoscow metro area has an in come twice that of the general russian economy russian continues to have a stagnating economy thand in flation rate of six point three per cent in this year five point to eight per sentin tweinty twenty three and almost fourteen percent in twenty twenty two when we talk about oun of the glories o moscow we shralso recognize that lots ic tatorships had really ni cities burlin under under hitler as a beautiful place dresden under hitler is a beautiful place rom under musolana is a beautiful place and alres a beautiful city thet there is nothing beautiful cities can exist across the world in various location and under various sistems of government theyre not actually the best marker of weather a government is properly run or whether the leader is good it his job that it that is not a sole indicator every single factor analisis fails an time ye say a i can tell that leader is good becaue ecause a beautiful city bt there is ther's a eighty five thousand other factors is to whether the leader is good he but again i think that what tucker is saying theire just to take it on its sfates value statemen is the least problematic or or interesting thing that that he said during this interview the moscow s beautiful in american cities ore not as beautiful and we should lean them up and not alographedian not alow pot an all the i agree with all that a it did sme of the other things that he said that i think have broughter implications for american for im policy for example tucker was asked by this egyptian journalist about gladmerputen and assassinating people and the egyptian journalists was well you now you could have asked him about why he kills people and censorship and all the rest and tha here was tucker's answer you should chan som ides fot instons o ou dedentok about freedom of speech in an russa iu did not okto about abon the about assissinations about about the ditidictions on a a position in the coming gelection i did not talk abou the things that every other american med out what talks abi he ize it tis y s as mot oar coverd and because i have spent my life talking o people who run countries in various countries and have not concluded the following that every leader kills people including my leader every leader kills people some on more than others leadership requires killing people sorry s why wouldn want to be a leader im that pres restriction is universal in the nite states i know becaue i've lived it ithat is my for m uve had a lot of job im and i've done this first thirty four years and i know how worss and im there is wore censorship in russha thin there is is n i sfates for ther's a great killing i i faith o cas this is where we star to get into the more interesting part of tha tuckar o saying here and when he says that he likes moscow are iht find when he starts to say that the russian way of assassination and censorship is somewhat akin to have the united states runs things the answer there is now just on a factual basis that the answer there is no ou now i now tos tucker carson does not only live in the united states quite safely criticizing the curent presidents of the united states as a senile dottard he makes millions of dollars doing what happens to you in vladmerputen's russia if you criticize bladmerpouten as a senile dotdard you kill yourself by shooting yourself twice in the back of the headen than being thrown off a building these are not comparable when tucker says that the that every one assassinates every one kills cand reminiscent of of michael corly own justifying the mofio when he talking to kay and godfather one zegala ka now who is being nive the idea that the president of the united states has the some mer the summary a bility to simply murder his opponents the way that gladinmer pouten does is not reality now i do not jobid neither i thin e's a terrible president i hope he is not president is soon is humanly possible not obviously without wishing any ill help on any one but let us be clear about this if your vision of the united states is that it is somehow comparable to the governents of a cleptocraft leke gladinmer pouten that seems pretty wild to mean if that is the basis of foreign policy i'm not shir how that is sustainable h the the the attempts to relativises the united states to russia under vladinmer pouten that is the part that i'm finding bazar here and in what tucker is saying and that leads to af foreign policy that is quite dangerous for the future of te united states if the foregn policy of the united states is russha good russian no worse than united states therefore f frussia takes you crane for example no problem a i do not understand how you uphold a powerful america in the world for the benefit ed son citizens under under that rubric now gain that is not a defense of anything jobidon is doing but tucker comparing himself and his treatmen the united states the treatment of russian journalist who des send from vladmer poutenis is just it it is notfactual it does not sem to have a relation to factual reality e get to more on thes in a second eus gen i thing that there are some very significant gabs in american form policy thinking and again this is wive in vited tucker on the shub he is or love to discuss this stuff with him and i've love to clarify our thoughts on this what does he think a good american form policy looks well get sim more of this in just a second first mark your calenders it is the epic return of back state almost a year away filming the pendragon cycel but jermay boring is back he is join byt mat walshkantisones michel mole's andrclavan and my johnis to night at seven pim eastern six pam central as we go behind the scenes and be on th headlines there is a lought to cover and i can one mis to menute watch the show live exclusively on daily wire plus to night at seven p m eastern six pm central you are not gon to one miss it ok meanwhile ukay we are going through the tucker interviewin to baks it has sort of his thoughts about what happen gladnmer pouten again ther're too iinteresting things about the the inervit puten one is what putent had to say which you went through pretty indept the other day and the other is sort of what tucker's perspective is cause of quortz tucker has a huge following and it is incredibly talented at what he does again the eclip that that has been on viral is is the one a bout him saying that moscow is wonderful place i find that less interesting and compelling then in his clip suggesting a sort of moral equivalence between vladmer pouten's assassinations and what the united states stues or censorship in russia and censorship in the united states and that extends to tucker really giving the benefit of the doubt to vladmerpouten he starts talking about gladmr pouten's r assion aw for invading ou crane and i got a say i i do not believe that dhis is reflective of the facts on the ground american policymakers have convinced themselves that vladimer putents can attake over poland and it is not a defence tha pudtent by do not mean to defend putent i'm not offan pudents and i'm not a subject of pudence of an america however there is no evidence that putent has any interest in expanding his porters he is the largest country in the world and it is very hard to run they do not need natural resources there is nothing in poland he wants there is nothing yeu will gain by taking poland other than more trouble u that the corcrussions why did he move his forcis in to easternicra and i watch this from a distant vanceinge to the united states and i watch the vice president the uninedstates comma harris go t the minic security confer just days repord that in february of twenty twenty two and say any public form any press conference to zolensky the president if the crant we wants you to join nato which i's another way of saing to seninym for we plan to put n new clear weapons on russia seing the asort who ama fora jocking frussingen thes ta ever one and it just tells you how constapated and restricted and sensered the us media landscape is that i was the only one who said that well re asecton the purpose of deplomacy is to reach a peacefulmutually wont hopes beneficial conclusion to a pricis if you are showing up volantarily the lunic security conference that san haszelensky why do not you allow us putt newcle weapons on russia's porter your crusing for war because the thread line ungates o verzval let us be clear that nato already cents to rssian borders the baltic tates are on russa's borers in their members of nato in fact nato has expanded during this war to include places finland also on russian border as far as the argument that vladmer putent does not have any designs on poland his entir disquosition on history to tucker suggests that he would be warm toward the division of poland because again if you lok at polish history poland did not exist for solidly a hundred and fifty years as an independent nation from about the mid eighteenth century allthe way up ti the end of world war ond it did not exist as an indepenination because het was under the preserve of the russians the the the land of poland was it was divided during that pone aagain the rusians were in charge of it and then after pland was reconstituted the mashov ribbon trop pact of nineteen thirty nine between the russians and the naties split poland right down he middle in which the soviets basically had a piece agreement with the russians said he could gan half of poland to pretend that russia has no territorial ambitions toward poland is weard it is also very very weird considering thet literally in november not of nineteen thirty nine of last year of last year demitri medvidev who ise the former russian president and a puden ally in fact when he was the president nows that brief period in time ere putten steped over to beng prime minister and medvedev was the shadow president this is why you will recall in twenty twelve brakla ma talking to medvedav and saying tell ladimir i'll have more f lexibility after the election because everyone knew thet medvdav was just a cut out for pooten well in november medvdav rote apes in eight thousand word article on russian polish relations saying mosco had a dangerous enemy in polan quote we will treat poland precisely as a historical enemy said medvdev in november of last year if there is no hope for reconciliation wit the enemy russia should have only one and a very tough at it to regarding its fate history has more than once delivered a merciless verdict to the presumptuous poles no matter how ambitious the revanchist plans may be thar collapse could lead to the death of polish statehood in its entirety again that is that is med medvedevsa cut out for pooten he is an alli pooten explicitly threatening the entor polan and if you spend time in poland what you will find is that every one in poland is deeply concerned with what is going on in ucrane because the polish people remember being invaded moltble times they know polishistory in which poly was polish was divvied poland was divied up repeatedly poland was then occupied by the soviet union after world war too was nots that was divided with the noses at he beginning of world war to it was then occupied by the sovia union for the entirity of the rest of the cold war this bizar notion that russia has no territorial ambitions in poland again runs counter to what members of pouten's inner circle are saying right now and granst a level of of credible doubt to the russians that ii do not actually understand tuckar doing not just that when tucker suggests that nato should hav invited vladimer pooten in intwo thousand the reason that nato did not invite vladmer pooten intonato into thousand or disbannato in the aftermouth of the cold war is because russia has had a long history of territorial ambition in eastern europe the purpose of nato was astucker says two check russian ambitions once you invite russia into the group you have an internato conflict let say that russia invades you crane unles they both of those countries were members of nato now article five cannot be invoked because article five is only able to be invoked against in a grussar against nato not by nato against a member state against another member state if for example lithuanio were to invade a stonia tomorrow you could not invoke article five realistically because both of those countries are members of nato the idea of russia trying to get into nato to thus thwart nato that is typical russian forn policy that is exactly how russia has used its seat for example on the uin security council they tried to use its seat on the uun security council in order to thwart nado intervention in uguslavia during the uguslav war of nineteen ninety nine an fact that something that that pootenis still mandabout thi scanom notion that vladimer pooten is a kindly hearted gentleman who is not seeking territorial expansion who does not have ambitions towardis eastern european neighbors who is not using threats of military force in order to convinced territorial neighbors to move toward him which is clearly what he is doing he has an af to invade bellerus bellers is already at proxy sta te of the russians and presumably that is what would happen if he took over you crane in full it would not just be that rushof rules you trainedirectly you would be tht he installs dictator declares you crank qul n quat independent and then rules the aproxy almost is part of the new sovi it constellation o bea state rule by proxy from moscow through an ally in not that the level of credibility that that tucker is granting to puten here what is that say about what his view of american form polisy is i i really am not sure a gan i can calling for clarification because tucker's really importantbois and i love to know what he thinks on all these things then tucker was asked during this interview about america's policy with regard to is rael and gaza and this part thener es rather stunning he suggests that america's roll with regard to israel ind gaza should be to force israel to stob it is killing of commoss members and i's attempts to defend it is on borders here was and and he invact he goes further he suggested america is evil for not doing that here was tucker in juby sir thou heaven explanation to this moment since the gas za events took place to now nobody came out and said how on ets the nite tate of america is ve toing the the stuppits of e fire how a country would be to not to contine ward hhha how somebody is a gans stupping awar the united states is for this moment is the most powerful country in the history of the world if you were to frame this in terms for all familiar with which ar the most basic terms the terms of the family the i fate to be that would be the father and the fathers sacred obligation is to protect his family and to restore peace within is wall if i come y fort aposmorsangor is o first wall for tucker whose posited that th united states really has no interest in things that goon outside of its borders in large scale to be suggesting a familial analogy here is already very strange it at the very least it strange the idea of america is world father is extremely imperialist that that america is basically out to dominate every am he sounds will sonian almost that it is the job of america to impose its will wherever huminly po a man athing that ist o proposition that the tucker dis agrees with strange to use an analogy where america is the father in its job as america is to restore peace everywhere on the globe first ofal to star wit that that is weird but the analogy continues if i come hy fortrat if i come home from work and to mi kids ar fighting whats the first thing i do even before i asest fi the fihting befor i gather the facts and now wit fact that a o the figt to fighti yes if i come onn ti have to con fighting i thin co cow it te crapat of em i amevil tbecause i violated the most basic duty of fatherhood which to bring pece because i have the power on the o nly one who can bring peape and if you see a nation with ostum power a betting war for its own sake you have a leadership that has no moral authority that is illegitimate and i and i'm very distrast and concern that we are entering an ara warer this ossom force for good is instead being used for evilogay he says america is effectively evil for not promoting a cease for leving coms i a terrise group in controle of the gazas strip using this familial analogy again therea thousand proms with this familial analogy just on the face of it number one comas is not part of the family of nations ay even if you were to accept tucker's analogy that america somehow great father in the sky that rules american form pot that rules form policy all over the globe and has a role in ending every war which i knowtuckar dis not agree with if even if you accept that analogy the next question is are these children both yours because i'm pretty much clear on the idea that israel is an american ally and incredibly pro american democracy in the region that provides pretty significant intelligence support to the united states and that comas is a terrorist group those are not if you 're to carry this analogy realistically it would be the father of one country meaning the father and than any associated child would be presumably in american ally in this in this particular analogy and then you would have a foreign child coming in and murdering twelve hundred of the citizens of the of your child beyond that let us just take his analogy strapt if you were the father and you walked into your home and i'm father of for and one of your children had stabs the other child in the eyeball which is what happene on october seventh your first move would presumably not be to sit every one down and find out how this had started by stopping the conflict some shot would get real because you would be the inforcement mechanism against that sort of thing you as the father are the in fhatso in other words huud be calling for interventionism now gain the entire analogy dos mechanisense israel is an independand country commoss is an independent polity the united states has its own interest does interest on dont aline always with either group that is that is being discussed at this point but the notion that america is evil for facilitating israls care on its own borders to destroy terrorscroup the just murdered twelve hundred of i citizens is pretty and that is pretty stunning stuff and it does line up with with a sort of broader tenor to tucker's view of america's role in the world which is that america historically and currently has been apparently a fairly negative force in the world i say that not just because of what he is saying about what is happening in gaza or american support for you crane or any of that he did not interview with russell brand thay came out fairly recently in which he was talking about world were to and what he suggested is that america was bad during world war to because america had engaged in what he called collective punishment now let us be clear about what america did during world war to in for example the fireboming of dressed in which was in fact manufacturing center or the firebombing of tokio which was military centr or in the bombing of heroshma and agasaki at the end of world war too america was attempting to win a war and forstalling american casual tees there in if you are america first and you wish for america to win wars in which it is engaged without getting a lot of americans killed sometimes you have to do really really ugly things i think most americans understand that and historicallyofe understood that particularly the grandchildren of the people who did not die invading the mainland of japan because of the dropping of the automic bombs for example militar estimate suggested that a milian americans could die in the invasion of japan if ithad been a an amfibious assault as opposed to dropping of of autonic weaponry over japan in august ive af forty five but here was tucker talking about american evil during world war to collective punishment is completely except it as legitimate lther all part the same bloodline that is incomprehensible to the christian mind because bloodline is a relephant neither juenor greek men the whole point of christianity is it does not matter who you'r parents were or whath should deanna is you have a direct relationship with god in if you are on board with that then youre christian if you are not youre not but there is there is no sense there is no templet for collective punishment in christianity it is it is it is repulsive to christians it is repulsive and in my fieuit should be and it always was in the west and i do think there are wore crimes tat the united states committed during the secondral war the firebombing of tokio famously dressed in am there were collective punishment and and i would also say by the way the automic bombs on heroshama nagasaki that was that is collected punishment i oke and i think that rotded the soul of the west yes i think that is immoral that it did two things one you carry the burden of sin that scale that you just do you can help it ind too that level of power in the hands of human beings convinced him that they were god yes is curious because you uld her a comparable ogument offed for slavery for example that theysabut an is born by american culcha and yet i've never had any one advane around the act of herashema a nagasaki i want it to o dropped atomic weapons on civilian populations i'm not indorsing imperial japan yes ind it was an impura power in the worst cense horrible horrible horrible government however you cannot ennihilate a civilian population and call yourself the good gui i do not care i love america i will defend america almost under any circumstances you cannot defend that and and the right and the letim in everybody in our country that no one revisits that was only eighty years ago we dropped atomic weapons on a civilian pop pulation i know that theire munitions pliants there but you just vapeorized tens or thousands peoplewho hath nothing women children the olderly thed nothing to do with tus yes then on now f you' fill good about tatinop pemistip unless you can on the god with a set of eficol and moral ogu is alfulgamize obsolutele o case let us be can commu be cleared bout something the west has then spent every moment trying to develop weaponry sophisticated that they can target specific military members even as they imbad among civilian populations which is what is real is doing for example right now in the gosistrip or wha th united states did when it fought isis or what the united states did wheni was fighting in a rock or af ganistan but the baseline notion that collective punishment is equivalent to war collective punishment is i know who the bad guyses are and i do not care who the bad guyes are i want to punish all of you out of malice and pressure that is the goal of collective punishment collective punishment is not youra war with a country that country is threatening you the only way to win the war and to make sure that your interests are maintained is to take certain military action that will have collateral damage collateral damage is not the same thing as collective punishment but tuctor s abtucker seems to equate these two things colatral damage and collective punishment as though the intent of the of the dropping of these boms does not matter what soever and that for close is the possibility of whinng war world were to again war has gotten a lotmarmihticulus since then which is why casualty numbers in war have dropped significantly i's also wi for example the united states despite having a newclear monopoly in the affromauth of world war to if that ad truly corrupted te american sold to the excent torussia that that that tuckar suggests here if tat is truly corrupted the american national sold that way from nineteen forty five until nineteen forty none the united states had a newclear monopoly no one else had abom we could have literally bombed moscow into rubble weuld have dropped one newk and we could ave finished the cold war at he beginning of the cold war but we did not because we cared about collateral damage because we did not want collective punishment yow this sort of generalized view of foreign policy which essentially suggest that everything that is bad in the world is a is in a responsism it is blow back to america's interventionism in the world becase america has historically and currently foster bad things in the world suggests a revanciist foreign policy in which the united states basically under cuts all of its interests in the world in the interests of of what now again maybe that collapsis backans that original isolationist argument that the u us has no form policy w do not neediformn policy erect of wall everythings good maybe that is the idea ok i think that is short sighted i do not thing that that is going to i do nothing that is going to be realistic in a world in which vacumes are filled by forces nefarious that do not america and do not wish for the prosperity of american citizens at least that is forign policy but this is w i clarification on these issues i think would be a good thing there isa lot of vague talk floating around about foreign policy and for the third time i would lug to sit down tucker and talk about these things to actually establish what he thinks a good and moral american foreign policy should look aready gis the rest

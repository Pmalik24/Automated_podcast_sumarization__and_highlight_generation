when yeffe as twenty two he had this rare problem with his eyes and doctors had to use lazers to fix vessels that were bleeding at the back of his left eye which worked gray but a long after on cold bright winter day he came into his house from the cold and saw this color and it was iu as almost an after image when you look at a bright light yet and it was a blind spot right where they had had put the lazers and instead of seeing blackness was this greenish not green it was a green that they could never exis it was florescent and as conpulsating and staticy that that green but not green action may be better we of describing it was if the color black was florescent and green it ive just con to say thise words back to you if the color black were florescent and green yes that sounds crazy rit yes yes you has some color seem more energetic bright red or bright yellow and others are more peaceful set of a blue green sea color what which is this it was both it was both ennergetic and call me but but a god of the color is greenish right it is in the kind of green family yet it is it is greenish i revryt about a munch yof markers a while your trying to to find a way of representin et to my doctor and if youre to try to painted or drot you would start with a kind of forescent green writ and then what would you add to it to add the other part that is not green black and fireworks you just said black and fireworks yes he said that if you have ever had a my grin headache it can come with a kind of colorful sparkoly static its that fireworks but really he said he is never done a good job describing this how do you describe a color that only you have seen ook et just it would wish of these things that what would you say byut this color what does it remind you of the feeling of punching somebody in the face or more a soft kiss from somebody who just falling in love with or more warm toast and butter on a cold morning you kno i have to say o of those of those three otions you give me i think i only have lots of experience with the third and does the color remind you of that one you ait warm toast and butter on a cold morning yim no does the color does it remind you of the feeling of of hope or more feeling of kind of exitential gred existential dread thtthe color does it remind you at all of the feeling that you get when you are a kid than you gett either a hoho or a dingdon and its sort of cool and the outside shell of it is perfectly hard invite into it in it cracks open in its soft and chocolating underneath o no the color does it remind you of the feeling of someody's wen a cook something for you and you do not know enough their good cookor bad cook and then it turns out there just an amazing cook aneverything you eat you think fisses of very good version of this particular thing that i'm eeting yet ie iis a little but more monday than that when you see somethng that nobody else can see it can be terrifying jeffey was scared that may be something was seriously deteriating with his vision eones it became clar that he was going t be fine yuse can be able to see they had the sother impulse to shows friends share it well ye i used to make drawings of it i used to make drawings of the shapes they ga used to black panden then iht did the outline in that florescent and it is you ho sho to my friends han they did not they did not get it they did not think it was that that me what would they say oh men usually usually what i get is is that is interesting ah that is the worst ye whers when you see somethingt at that the people can yusta i thnk for most people you want to tell somebody wen to share it you wan to do something to day an fer hn we have three stories of ople in this exact situation whone inboving science one abot in comedy one abot angels if people see something nobody else can and they cannot stop themselves they cannot shut up about it don you be easy chicago its s this american life i ir a glass stay with us at one do these genes make me look fatless el let us kick things off with this story somebody who not only sees something that nobody else sees when he tells other people about the stuff she sees they do not buy it investigatve reporter david epstine explains i wrote a book called the sports gne it is pardly about how some super athletes are genetically different from the rest of us they have supergnes thei're physiological freaks i was daluged with emales from parents wanting to know how they could find out if their child had michael georgan gines a coach wrote offering up his players as guinea pigs for genetic experimentation there were many unhinged emales coming in that i pretty much stopped opening them and then i got this one that had the subject heading o lympic metalist and muscular distriopi pationt with the same mutation i opened it figuring it would be a link to some article that i'd missed in my reporting instead it was a note from a thirty nine year old ioa mother her name was gill viles she was the muscular distrefupation and she had a wild theory linking her genes to an olympic sprinter named priscilla lopes shleet and she wanted to send more info shire i said send it along why not days later a package arrived a nineteen page illustrated bound packet it thumbed through it et was a little weird hand drawn diagrams with cut outs of little cartoon weihtlifters representing protine molecules old photos of herself in her siblings the original pictures not copies there was a detailed medical history and he was clear she knew some serious science she described in detail how protines function she referr to geniutations by their specific deana addressers the way a scientist would and then i landed on page fourteen there were two photos one of gill in a royal blue bikiny sitting on a beach her torso looks normal but her arms it is the're on the wrong body the stick arms on a snow man her legs too are thin that her knee joint is wider than her thigh those legs cannot possibly hold her upright i thought the other picture was of priscilla lope shleep whof been ranked the best hurtler in the world ind two thousand eight she won the bronze metal in the one hundred meter hurtles at the olympics an basane in the photo she is in mid stride it is hard to describe just how muscular she looks icture all the muscles youcan imagine on a woman now picture more in that photo priscillas the vision of a super hero that a third grater might draw huge muscles bursting from her thiyes her skin can barely contain all the power beneath it ropy venes snaking along her byseds this is the woman gill believed she shared the same to hat ac jill ws toll le mis jill rememberhis arms and legs ar liketeio all jill's life doctors had been mystified by her case they had no idea how her muscle disease work much less out a treated she did know her disease came from ararge an tamutation and she wanted to reach priscilla because looking at photoes of priscilla seeing her body she saw clues that made her believe priscilla had the same mutation if priscilla did if jill was right and scientists might figure out what was making jill's muscles shrink in priscilla's muscles balloon and maybe people jill could some day be help the whole thing seemed a longshot i reached out to robert green at jeneticistad harvard who had got to know while writing my book he is an important proponent of people being allowed to get their own genetitests ut after looking at the pictures of jill an priscilla he thought jill was almost certainly wrong he doubted they had anything in common and science the side he had other concerns for one thing us a somewhat famous athilet ah just any other a celebrity can we come the focal point for an individual for various reasons in a very unhealthy way i was concerned that an power ing relationship between these two women could a in badly yeh i mean people go off the deep in when they are relating to celebrities they think they have a connection to of course this a very polite way of saying maybe she is a nut job i wondered the same thing how could you not the i dea thet niwa housewife working off gugal images would make a medical discovery about a professional lathle whose body has ben obsessively examined for years by a small army of doctors and hat letic trainers it seeme pretty ludicrous but the fact is heople with emds and ph des hade been telling jill that her theories are ludicrous pretty much her whole life jill was born in nineteen seventy four at first everything was great she met all the normal baby milestones she sat crawled and walked on time then it age four she started stumbling and tripping all the time constantly falling flat on her face i would described this fear i had about witches fingers this is jill and you kow my mama's kind of puzzled what what was i talking bout witche is fingers what do you mean and when we walk ti fell the sensation almost they were little they were narl hands and fingers reaching up and graving my shins that i'd fallverly forcepily that was kind of to beginning of noticing something witstefferen jill's dad remembered that he would had some problems walking around the same age which his doctors said was the result of a very mild case of poleo but jill's troubles were much worse than her dads had ever been and no one could give them an answer her pety atrician was stumped he suggested they take her to the mail clinic they were stumped there too they tested the whole family and found that jil and her brother and her dad all had signs of muscle damage but jill was the only one having trouble walking it might be muscular distrophy the doctors thought but that did not usually show up this way and little girls they were really really a sir theyd never seen anything this they said our family was extremely you neek and they could not defind what tiht but was you knal eltimaly that is good and one way because there being onest but in the other hand of is terrifying what is my life expectancy what are the symptoms that all be jealing with it is alarming you do not have something to grasp te hold of jill went back to the mail clinic every year and it was always the same there was nothing the doctors could do nothing knew they could tell her they constant falling eventually stopped but was replaced by a burning sensation in her legs and wile she was growing in height a normal girl the fat on he arms and legs was vanishing by the time she was eight her arms and legs were skinny that other kids could rappe their fingers around her wrists and ankles by age twelve veins were bopping out of her legs hids asked how it fell to the old and then her muscles started to fail again i conmember just gettng in a bike i dalways ridden and feeling someone came up behind me and just threw me into the handlebars and got a big ruws across my cest from ou know i fall where to coulden pold my self over th the bike i just start my muscles thuch as star quivering and rollers kainin i invited a friend to go with me and i came even stand up on the sgates and i'm just sitting here going somein is jus somethins terribly wrong how rapit how quick was that that you tasically lost the ability to rullder staden in ryjer beg i was say public within a few weeks o jilded even bothered tell her parents what was happening she knew there was nothing there the doctors could do about i by the end of that summer the symptoms es done she could walk o pay again she started looking for answers on her own but she did it the way a kidwould you knowi'm having my body do things that i cannot control forces are acting on me and i develops curiosity fascination with things i would read about polter geise and i would bring home lots of books from the library ah i remember it really frorke got my dad at one point cas he tipped over my book bag and there is all these books about supernatural things and he was wha you in to the accolter what one out it was nothing of the sort it was aboups i could not explain what was going on with me the doctors could not explain and i found these people that people could not explain what was happening to them totally fascinating ah i believe im by the times shoment to college shelad maxed out at five foor three in about eighty seven pounds she decided that if she was going to figure out what was happening with her body she would have to do it herself duringgill's first somaster she set up camp in the library she began poring over every text book and scientific journal article she could find on different kinds of muscle disease i just that while ell star reading about them one by one and see if something fits she did this for months going article by article a police officer driving up and down every street doing a grid search but nothing really fit until she came to a page in a medical journal about an extremely rare type of muscular distrope called emeri drifus and then looking at the pictures i was a very startling thing to realise i'me see in my dands arm just an instantaneous lock on something that is in your visual memory but what did you say as the little girl i would ah notice he had what i called papi arms big forearm and hand muscles and then at i'm reading about every drifeas they actually describe the look of the arms as a papi arm to farmady but there were very very few fotoes of women with im mrih drif as mustcular gestrpe the journal described at the three hal marks of emory drifis patience they couldn' tust their chins their chests or their heels to the floor and her arms were pe petually bent at the elbow and i ou know get chills readidn this thin can live got all three ah a really great visual to think about that is shockingly a a barby don that is elbows tat do not bend and feet slanted to fit into high heels actually as a terrefic representation of what toes the mery drifas look which is very ironic as we get this to little girl since they this is perfect and where actually handing them a doll that has tenen't in disorder when you flip open you and you see these pictures and see these descriptions is it the likeball just slipped on in this is it delibl i i was sure it is it is ery i s great but as terrifying a what was very frightening was to read thers to a lot of cardiacisheis sin volv it this disease emiry drive is patience je learned often droped dead of heartfailure she became obses with reading about it before she went home for college break she stuffed her bag full of medical books and journal articles purposely even hit them under several books cause i did not wone o alarm anybody at home and i went out in the kitchen long enough to make my croy pop corn and i came back in to my my dat was reading them nd i tried to take him away and i jus do not you now do not read those and he was really sucked into it and he said wle i i have all these sympthems nd i said wollya i know the arm thing and the the nak and and he said no he said i have all these cardiaccemptems he had always thought the stiffness in his muscles and hart troubles were unrelated he said whall the doctors told me i had o virus not to worry about it we both just looked each other in i said you do not it is not a virus it is this we have o mory drithus they went to the i wi heartsenter where doctors put a heart monitor on jeal's father his polse rate dropped below thirty beats perminnute which meant he was either about to win the tour to france or he was about to drop did he had a pacemaker put in immediately she safed your dance life i mean just absy amazing this is jils ma'm mary but was not for her how oud we have ever knownness am and i y i remember being in the hospital that day and i i think he is just yn aw of j and he just love total do not love for cell but i think was a hard burden for her because it just seem wy nelse was loking the ie hard center was not set up to confirm whether not her family ad emiry drifes that was not their specialty she went looking for some one who could remember she was nineteen well i went to a nerology clenek a i can remember even what i wore that day i dressed up as professional as i could i wanted to be taken seriously i mean i i had not a navy pancse ut and tried to present the articles to my a nerologis and how did youven start that conversatio howd you make your case i just said i'd been studying to necs aid mis funding a great dill a time in the library and i've come across these photos and iam sure this is what we have and this is this is the name and could you look at these with me and the doctor just was very abruft with me and said now you do not have that and refuse to look at the papers it might seem rude that a doctor would refuse even to look but at the time most doctors believed emory drifis only occurred in men also this was a self diagnosis coming from a tea nagure a defiant tea nagur there was times that when i was in the doctor's office i would see my chart and it wul just list dignosis muscular disterpy i known ediology i hated seeing that i letterally just take a pen on on my persond i scratch it out and i'd writ am i drifis muscular justrpy and my ma would see me thou tha tick c not cannot panch your chart and i i wanted list ad whan i have in her reading bin she would come across a group of researchers working out of italy they were looking for families with emiry drifes to study hoping to locate the jane that causes the disease je'll decided to write to them she mapped out af family tree noting the symptoms she saw in her father two younger brothers and a younger sister then she stripped down to her underwar and that i set the timer on my camera and i took pictures of my self cause i thought will if that is how i addentified it only send a picture and just inquired would you one to take a look at our family up to this point the italians had only collected four other families to study they were thrilled to hear from jill and they immediately wrote back from the letter it seems they think she is a scientists who has access to a lab they asked can you send as d'onee if you cannot prepare d'onee just send fresh blood but nineteen year old gill soon learned yoy cannot just go to the local hospital and say draw my blood i want a cended to europe sod jill con vinced a nurse friend to smuggle neels and testubes to her house they filled them up with samples of her family's blood and shipped them off to italy to day you can sequence an entire genomin a few days but back in the mid nineteen nineties not much it was four years before jll heard something definitive back from the italians they confirmed she had emory driphes she would been wright all these years despite everyone telling her otherwise one day i open eme and there a was and that was a weird feeling to realized to e this is it i cllice don et and they tell me that name of the ge end of its neclare lamb and the researchers had discovered the genetic cause of jill's illness a gene called the lamangene what makes the lam an gene really important is that it effects the command center inside every cell in your body this turns other genes on and off light switches changing the way they build fat and muscle jill's lam an gene has a typo in it a serious one along the spiralling ladders of her deonee the three billion ges tes as and seas that make up jill's geno she had one letter in the wrong place and it is jus almost darkly comical to think seriously and on this cless to find out cable what happen exactly at it comes down to a geou as change to as thin soon after ji'll got an internship in a labit john's hopkins that was mapping diseases associated with the lamon gene the lab director had heard about jill's research on herself and saw a chance to have not only a dogged intern in the lab but also their very own real life lamon mutin jill's job was to sift through scientific journals and find any references that had been linked to a lamon mutation sitting theire day after day reading she came across an incredibly rare disease a disorder called partial lipodistrophy iy causes the arms and legs to look as if all the fat on them has been melted away leaving veines and muscle to stand out looking at photos of patience with the disease all jill could think was that these people looked her family members could jillin her family have not just one but two rare genetic diseases the odds of getting one of them was one in a million the odds of getting the other is one in at least a million and the odds of geting both to gether there have not been enough human beings in th history of our species that any one should ever get both just before when jill discovered emory triphes she zeroed in on a photo in a medical article and saw herself in it and just before she tried to get confirmation from doctors she tried to tell scientists that she had the second rare disorder partial odistrophy and just before they said no they said that statistically there was very little chance that could be true instead they diged nost her with something a little more common they did not necessarily laugh at me but were kind of incredulous that no you do not have that and theven kand it described it is internce in drum where you have a medical studend that is being introduce to lated nou diseases and the con think in they have what they are reading about i just thought well i must be wrong i think i to is buying an to that idea that that is quite a reage to they they yen the second tonatic disorder because it is a rare too i just kind o thot wile mey bem an i not to i kind of back toway from that even tho les kind of a daeot wo feeling she dropped in she stopped reading about this new disease and before long she stopped doing researching to emry drifist too mostly because the research she was doing started to freek her out in the case studies she read the average person with emery drifis was dead by their early forties she was twenty five an anxiety over this was landing her in the hospital i had to panic attacks that were brought on by the stress of reading all of these things that they just died suddonly and i went to a council for a while i worked with my cardiologist and we decided it was just too much information it was not healthy i really just did not look up things did not read articles and i really got to the point that i desided i want to go on with my own life she went cold turkey no more medical research no more dei why diagnosis she took a job as a writing instruct or at local community collogist and taught a dull education classes at night she started dating eventually meeting the man who would become her husband and even though ther was a fiftyf fifty chance that she would pass on the emery drifis geniutation they decided to have a child her pregnancy was normal and her baby martin does not have the disease but after he was born jillrally deteriorated physically if you ever had a muscle to which how strange it feels dod not have control of your body jill's muscles started twitching from head to to sometimes for hours at a time and she was suddenly having to hold on to her husband to steady herself the best what i can describe with what it was it would be where gravity is getting incredibly heavy and it is some mice turns up the knob and you think of how highwould they have to turn up this gravity that i cannot get up off the floor by myself i cannot stand up right i cannot take a step you knw it is it is a tremendous amount of forese pushing on the body by martin's first birthday she could barely walk one day he was callin that he wanted macarony and cheese and a i knew i i was yen i'd six steps to take my i realize this is tha this is thit this vlas six steps om gano tay i i just knew as that that point that i was not be able to get up again at the same time jill's father was also losing his bility to walk father and daughter transition to life in motor ize scoutors jils ays her dad was discouraged for the first time in his life after a visit with an herologist he told her i feel i go there just to be waged then one day she got a call from mermam and it was about dad he just moved from his schoter into his favourite chair he said to my mom he just felt tired and then he simply just found as hadn'n he did not breathe again and he die he had a sudden cardiacta at what age was it he was sixty three on the day he passed away jillin er tibblings and relatives gathered at her parents house after mulse people at gone if his conslowing down and my sisters said i got i got thist tust show you she starts pulling up pictures of this extremely muscular athly and i just took o look at it just kind of wet we do not wha wou knon't we do not have that i me whant what are you talking about this of course was priscilla at first jill did not get it did not see any connection with the muscle bound athlee it had ben twelve years since she went cold turkey on medical research but a week later jill got curious she started gougling pictures of priscilla not just runting photos but shots of her home doing regular things feeding her daughter baby food it helped seeing the clothing on her to see how it fit it was just unmistakeable it is a pewter that could analize a photograph and get a match and be a hundred per cent sure that is the same shoulder that is the same upper arm i see the same veins i see them branching this way he just know and that is hard to c onvay how could she just now but i knew ut we were very likely cut from the same cloth a very very very rare cloth it was the third time jil saw something in a photo other people did not see it had happened with emory dryfis it happened with lypodistrophy now she saw that she and priscilla were both missing fat in the same places on their arms and legs they had the exact same muscle divisions in the exact same places in the hips and bud jil was certain this was because they shared a mutegene and the only question was why did the jene blow up priscilla with muscles and take gills away this is my crip to nig but it is her rocket fel i me were we are conmac book superhere as that are just as divergent as could be i mean o her body has found away around it somehow i know that sounds the plot of a holly would movy in fact it is totally the plot of unbreakable the bruce willi's samuel ell jackson film jackson plays a broken bone physically fragile man searching for his genetic opposite a man born strong his body will survive any physical drama in final scene jackson tells willis that he is th gi t a aso se wanted to enlist priscilla an her genetic detective work but there was a practical problem she had no idea how to go about reaching her may ni've had crazy ideas can i fly a candidat shel up at a meatin greet and try to talk to her an it is iif you ere on this moter i cooter and it is yenow you'e just connente there restraining order at best i made people will think you are crazy i was just trying to resign myself to the fact that well what am i going to dell a full year past and then jill happen to be an ear shot of her tell ovision when i started yammering about athletes and genetics on dismoining america find the best fit for your unique geno and then special iyes in thet midteniars an that all tis is just the pattern this is just if i otnance this is exactly what i'm looking for jill reached out to me with a request and i did happened to have a way to get it to priscilla through her agent it was such a odd request is is really out there ih this of course is priscilla im he is just this lady sheis and i wa i just as she has the same gene as you and once have a conversation i was in i do no cress an es have a conversation see were gos jill son priscilla the same bound packet that she sent me and it was not any of the cryptic science that got to priscilla it was a childhood's stories jill shared about kids pointing at the veins in her legs priscilla said she always used to come home sad and crying she would asked her parents can i get the veins remove fom my legs because i on the ways are making fun of me just lie allor legs ar vainy you likewise it look that once she grew up the finger pointing did ant end it just morfed when people see huge shredded muscles priscillas on an athlete it usually means one thing stereroids and priscilla's been dogged by doping rumors since college after she won the olympic bronze metal and bejene some media outlets in europe began to openly accuse her and of course there was a not furtive glances m you would walk by and people kind alike would whisper oh look at her gloots ar look at her er look at her arms er her shoulder is ar her cas ans they go look look loik it is more on then i memmerr thereis one picture as put out they put a big jud's face on my body and i just than he just er ive ilike i'm i'm lift gnk as my i'm running and plas shaying towards the finish lince i'm using every ounce every inch in o ever yo ti he is a energy my body to get to that finish line thi was pretty messap and i was really pissed about that and tetus i got testi i i i thougly how its targative because i got testit much for track and field and i think a lot of people really honestly truly believe that i was saking stories at the world champion ships in berlin in two thousand nine priscilla was drug tested just minutes before winning a silver metal there is not even supposed to be any drug testing that close to the race then the following month that immetin greece some one stold her training journal out of her bag it was at the very bottom underneath expensive work out clothes and shoes none of which were taken why stealla training journal it someones covereda lot of doping stories i'm convinced some one thought the journal contained her stailwoyd regiment priscilla an jill spent a lot of time talking on the phone in eight months after i first put them in touch they finally met hin person in torano where priscilla lived they picked a hotel lobby jilla rived first i got to be a few minutes past the time we were get to me that couple mar menison it is ard to get really scard i have much writing on this i was just latchd in the doors okis thi hiris the sir ou i was not sure and i see this lady that all my gash this is see im family priscilla felt the same way it really was just a wow mome do i now you get they ayou awes are talking and it jus jus giggling about o kea got a flex for you hthen she is she that it is the te harder for to get a setter hostis to plen a sot of to show me sixtee i do have i do have the definition to him you do you do a but s wit is thot smaller than yours than we cant a giggo and but it was still ok there is something really a something here let us tat's th research o that is find out because how could the jenes do this to you and o do this to me that is that was where my question was and how it took a year to find a doctor to test priscilla finally jill went to a medical conference and approached the foremost expert and lipodistrophy doctor obby minu garg who runs a lab at university of texas southwestern medical center he agreed to do the testing the results showed the jilla been riht she and priscilla do avigenet i connection they each have a single typo on the same one of our twenty three thousand genes the lamon gene it is not the exact same typo but theire almost rihte next to each other that is splinter of distance and typa location makes the difference between jill's muscles and priscilla's muscles it is why jill has emery drypus and priscilla dozn but doctor garg also found that they do share disease they both have the exact same rare sub type of lypodistrophy the diseased that wastes away fat jila been told it had nothing to do with ther back when she was a summer in turn to john's hobkins jila been right about that all along doctor garg called priscilla immediately to give her the news he caught hr them all shopping with her kids as is dreami about going getting a big ducy burger frie and doctor garg calls me and says i have your results a ma gok and then as can i call you back cause i'm in them all right nigas i now it is kind of important are you bet to go eat lunchin s yes ou's you only lought to have salad your un track for a pangras attack and is see what then hech told priscilla that despite her rigorous training regiment her untreated lipodistrophy left her with fifteen times the normal amount of fat in her blood her next hamburger could lander in the emergency room she was that close in other words once again jill steered some one away from a medical disaster shed saved her dad's life now using the cutting edge medical tool known as gucal images she caused the most tentense medical intervention in the life of this professional athlete that is what i just oh my gash if this was not for a jell i would definly hae been in the hospital and i called her and i told her as you prut much to save made from having to go the hospital an se goes wet i go doctor garg told me that i have the jen and my num r is ir atheres scientists can learn all sorts of things by studying very rare genetic diseases for instance research on a rare geniutation that gives people freakishly low collestral levels led to a drug that treats high collesteral iu knall zimer's treatment might come from studying a small group of people in iceland they have a super rare mutation that protects their brains recently a group of scientists started something called the match maker exchange it is a kind of oke cupid for rare diseases where people can share genetic and symptom in formation with each other and doctors the hope is that it will spark new discoveries it is just the the weep of gesat of maka sings bosybor that is etian lefe a molecular biologist in france he does supertechnical work on a protine with the lovely name esari b p one it affects fat storage and his research team showed that messing around with it can create mice with almost no muscle at all or potentially little roden schortzneggers when jil first reached him she told him that he may have found the actual biological mechanism that makes her in priscilla different o k that that is tregias a kind of foraffliction from my side say sat really good question that is a really weally good question because i have no idea o f what ti genbo was genidi dis before she confact me now i have changea bothle for my teem a resut tribject and this is only becaus gilconfact me tho years ago shes a te tetiawsm and have you ever had the experience of someone outside the scientific community an affecting your researcagendanis can it way a e my lafno people from outside going ana giving me halps new idea i have no exemple of these kind of sings maybe aen ansinin he scientific ife conmo of course this is different hin the skepticism jills gotten from scientists and doctors for decates i check back in with one of the doubters robert green the geneticist ad harvard i first talk to who was incredulous about any genetic connection between gill and priscilla i you meld him the results of priscilla's genetic test oh i was knocked over i was completely and utterly astounded and i remember thinking i was i was ashamed that i had doubted this individual because she turned out to have a remarkable a discovery about a week after i talkd to doctor's green and lefey i played those conversations back for gill could ye letoke the a and what is in your mind when you hear that yess if it really does phill really good a i it is kind of ad this wait come offo me som exhausted emmotionally and antellectually and in every way possible and i in

programme before she talk to nancy updyke about a recent rule breaking edition to one of her stand up choes as we know fifty eight per cent of all important events in america start in the car tig and her fiance stephany were driving along with her mother her sis ter my stepfather and my brother and we were in new worlands and ams is a big car yeh we had aness you thing and my fiansa her her mother was telling us this joke that she had come up with and in trying to tell the joke that she had made up she was laughing hard she could not get the joke out this went on for a couple of minutes laughing catching her breath almost starting to tell the joke and then more un controllable laughing until every one in the car was laughing just watching her trying to tell the joke i i do not know that ive ever written a joke this funny this is iufli writ this is my job and i have never made somebody laugh as you are making your own self laugh exactly it its what come on carroll what is this joke and the tig had a vision of what needed to happen at her next stand up show it became very apparent to me just thought o my gash i have to have her on my showl to tell her joke whatever it is before she got to the joke before she even to loan e while she was laughing ye oh my gash immediately avo am coming to the stage please welcome my girl friends mother carroll lashed and two weeks after the car wride tig made her vision come true caroll walks on to the stage a commo clubin last angelis called largo she is not in gene she is non comody club casual she is a tasteful mom in cropped white pants carrying her purse she is a civilian yiyou feelit well i cannot really describe how in feeling because i've never felt this imotion before i do not know what it is he just b ummed everyone out carrol carroll knew two thing as sing about her own joke when she walked on to the stage she knew that it was not a very good joke she told tig when tig wash trying to convince her to come on stage she said this is not nobody's can a laugh carroll also knew that she herself could not tell the joke without laughing she was living the mystery many of us have lived the all the way inside joke the joke that is funny beyond reason in your head and you cannot communicate the funniness because you do not even understand it that is what carroll knew she was nervous can you tell me how and when you tought of the joke oh k well first i would feel atot more comfortable if i laughed no actually actually i would feel a lot less uncomfortable if you tif it aon labut if you told them this was not my idea oh they know that one wa's there one person at all here to night do not be shy raise your hand if you think carroll ashed and said i they tig is carroll got's stand up that is gen a llow yourah carroll i cannot just put you on stage at largo whit is here the joke hid i khod must be good nobody here thinks that you ask to be here were you driving along in the idea came to yet i was driving alone and i got this great idea i thought this is a very funny joke what is why you are here to ni carrolfirst i have to explain thot it is kind of fly caan was at at dot that it is a play on words ans good to explain what jon ro the joke oteol let the figer it out you tell thotell them tarroll i well well stepan you sat it is that lie garri joke where it is she what are the odds lile carro getting wokin to see it is ta an o joe are i we got the jon ra doti ivin along and it came to me about the only prcom ti us get's about somebody that is not really in the news never really a news but in the public eye in o cas it is tat e ti oa is o a tak ups te downside i we got the jonra we have establish that this is completely out of date material and sincyere the canadian not right now i of course everything carroll is doing is usually comedy death it was explaining the joke exposing the machinery of it it was and she is killing anyway should i say who the joke is about well that is necessary ri it is your joke i the joke is about paris hel see what i mea lik parisel i know it yets about parris helden and this is the joke who would name their ki oi eeecarroll's rocking back r and slapping her knees shes lathing hard she has spent the last ten minutes leaving caviats laing out everything the joke has going against it why it is no good and then when the joke comes into her head as she is about to tell it none of that matters i ae her oci doft o te same people that would name their yit after a famous city and nolady is an gentleman cai mean i when i got out stays that niht i do not know it was slan again the oner of largo that somebody was i think that was the biggest response that they never heard in that room it was alus one of the biggest camadians in the world made a guest apparente on my shell all jokes start his inside jokes inside some one's head some of the make it out into the world and catch on and that is comedy the wait usually works this was a rare chance to root for the other kind of jokethen non starter the grush no one understands including you you rational brain can make its rational arguments and then what you stop having feelings you do not understand now and hupdags is one he produces him a programm togs tars book i'm just a person came out last somme a threein erst angels he clise tid hy sbok him with this story about somebody who sees and believe something that nobody else does the met got carret it is read for us by actor alex's krapowsky on burnar that avenue right next to the central buvstation there is a whole in the wall there used to be annades him there once but it broke or something or else nobody ever used it the people from the bank came in a pick up and took it and never brought it back somebody wance told udy that if you scream a wish into this whole it comes true but udy did not really buy that the truth is that once on his way home from the movies he screamed into the hole in the wall that he wanted deafni remolt to fall in love with him and nothing happene and once when yhofs feelin really lonely he screamed into the hole in the wll that he wanted to have an angel for a friend and an angel really to show upright after that but he was never much of a friend and hit always disappeard just when udy really needed him the sanger wa skinny and all stooped and you wore trenchicot the whole time to hide his wings people in thes tree were sure he was a hunchback sometimes whentherewere just the two of them he take the coat off once he even let udy touch the feathers on his wings but when there was any one else in the room he always kept it on kids asked him once what he had under his coat and he said his a backback full of buks that did not belong to hi and that he did not want them to get wet actually he lied all the time he told udy such stories you could throw up about places in heaven iabout people who when they go to bed at night leave the keys in the acnission about cats who are not afraid of anything and do not even know the meaning of scat the stories he made up were something else and to top it all he crossed his hart and hope to do udy was nuts about him and always tried hard to believe him even let him some money a cup of times when he was hart up as for the angel he did not do a thing to help udy he just talked and talked and talked rambling off as hair brain stories and the six years he knew him udy never saw him much as rintz a glass when udy was in the army and basic training and really needed some one to talk to the angel suddenly disappeared on him for two solid monce then he came back with an unshaven do not ask what happen face udy did not ask and on saturday they sat around on the roof in their underpans just taken in the sun and feeling low udy looked at the other rooftops with the kable hook ups and the solar heaters and the sky it occurred to him suddenly that and all their years together he would never once seen the angel fly ow about flying around a little he said to the angel ut make you feel better and the angel said forget it what if some one sees me be a sport udy nagged just a little for my sake but the angel just made this disgusting noise from the inside of his mouth and shot a gob of spit and white flam at the tar covered roof never mind udy sulked i bet you knoft no how to fly anyway sure i do the angel shot back i just a' want people to see me that is all on the roof across the way they saw some kids thrown a water bomb udy smiled once when i was little before i met you ease to come up your lot and throw water bombs on people in the street below i'd aim them into the space between that oning and the other one he explained bending over the railing and pointing down at the narrow gap betwen the awning over the grocery store and the one over the shoe store people would look up and ll they would see was the awning it would not know where as coming from the angel got up too and looked down into the street he open his mouth to say something suddenly udy gave him a little shove from behind and the angel lost his balanc udy was just flown around he did not realy me to hrt the angel just to make him fly a little for lags but the angel dropped the whole five floors a sack of potatoes stunned udy watched hime lying there on the sidewalk below his whole body was completely still hexcept the wings here were still fluttering a little ots when he finally understood that of all the things the angel had told them nothing was true an he was not even an angel just a liar with

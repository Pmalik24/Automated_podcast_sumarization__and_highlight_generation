race to replace the speaker is on again the recriminations have only begun at this point because the fact the matter is this was a stupid fight that that choose nothing it is all about an sent o structures as i suggested yesterday on the show its not about kemicarty being a bad speaker of the house the truth is wasn bout pauryan being a bad speaker of the ouse make a better case that was baner being a bad speaker of the house but the reality is that in all the situations these these folks have been ouse ded largely because of divided government and then unrealistic expectations from other members of the political caukis whoeither have on realistic expectations or who are fibbing to their own crowd see for politicians it is the intentive structure is always to tell your own people the things they want to here and what your people wont here is if they vote for you they will get the sun the moon in the stars if they vote for you you will beable togive them everything an possibly have wanted and ten when that dulsnt materialize youave a couple of choices one is you coun be honest with them heu tillusen we did the best that we could we got the most that we can the problem there is that you are goin t be outflank by some one else who is going to come along and promise them the sun the moon and the stars se uneither ali on the intelligence of your voting base which you gould do and i think the most honest and best politicians do do that is illistet we are shooting for one hundred per cent and stead we got eighty per cent we got sixteeper sent that is all we coul get because that is the reality of life but it does put you in the political danger of being out flank by some one who is going to promise you everything in the world and the way that you were able to keep members in line to keep them from doing this sort of stuff originally was that the party structures were pretty significant meaning that they could deny you money that if you if you cross the party the party could punish you in some way well as the parties have become significantly less important in american political life and by that i mean the parties exert virtually no pull over their members any more that is certainly true in the r publican partys less true in the democratic party where ao see will follow nancy plosy not because shou loves nany plosy but because nancy blosy has the power to punisher or did until very recently we in te republican prty there is no power to punish in fact it is precisely the other way around in order for speaker mac carthy to a become speaker of the house can make promises to a very small cootery of members of his own caukas bight be vast minority of is own caukas that a single person could initiate a vote to take down the speaker he had to do that nor to get the speakership this will hat put him an inherently weak position here is the problem now when people say oh one place mc carthy was soe on btter fine let us say thhe get chim jordan i love jhim jorn gim jordans great representative from ohioes on the house overcide committe is real bull dog and own personally he is great or let us get she get steeve schoolies steeves terrific i real likes tee blot let us he get either one of those guis as speaker of the house if the same rules applid to them that applied to ceven mccarthy it will not matter if they are quonnpoot better than ceven macarthy because in the end wlet usay it comes down to another continuing resolution and you are one of these members of congress ho is not behold insyur party but who does make hay by fibbings your constituents that the son the moon in the tars or possible well you can just do the same thing to jim jordan you call him morino hou say way way you warn't willing to shut down the government over spending that is becaue youare in sufficiently conservative you you must be ousted the only way this gets better ironically is for matgates to have all of his power takin away by the new republican majority speaker that is the only way this works the only way this gets better is jim jordan in making the deal to be come speaker basically renags on all the things that co mc carthye promised including the ability of people to challenge to speakership with one vote a the otherwise this just cent to keep happening all it takes is one all takes is five because the house majority or the republicans is damned slim by theway one of the reasons that it' unbelievably slim as opposed to what it was sup posed to be after the last election cycle which was a thirty seat house majority for the republicans the reason for that is because donald trump back ty bunch of really bad candidates in purple districts and they lost that is the reason in fact moderate re publicans one in new york if they were god candidates florida they did really well llout of ther place in the country they lost very tight races in large parpbicas they were very very trumpy and they offended a lot of those swing voters in the for the same reason that republicans did not winseniteats in say arizona or in georgia or in pennsylvania the the the problem is stemach is the point that i makin tand to pretend that this is a principal to act by matgates in company to oust mc carthy and tha if we get some one better in there that is con o fix all our promise now we will get spending under a contral not true it is not true at if you believe that then you are just going t keep getting succored bthis a point made by represent of cloudyatenny she is a representative from it new york and again she is from new york which means she is vulnerable now you may say whet she she is a ry now how how could she not one of loers she does one lors mennn she is also from it new york and here is the thing you want a national majority or do you prefer who kein jeffreys to be speaker of the house if you would the re publicans to be in charge of congress you need people claudyettenny in congress she is in a swing district here is clodottenny we would not have supena the documents we would' av had g since smithis char the houseways a means committee who open the mistle blower cordal we would never ave known what these listle loers brought for now under under to rass under threat of their jobs we would not know any of te s non of this men o mc carthy had not been speaker an it is nt about havin ta carthe these people are ging a whole hosstage whoever the next speaker is and that is right that is right i would hope the wether is jim jornor seevsclees whoever becomes the next speaker of the house the dictate is i need i'm not i'm not going to even alow emotion to hit the floor unless a majority of the re publican cockas wantit i'm not gon to do it i'm not gan to have a motion to get rid of me a speaker unless there is a large contingent you nives on a majority a signofbe mynority that does not want me to be here i'm not gon to do it for one vote men can do for for votes and that by the way should be the same thing offered by every speaker of the ouse candid an the probaa you have collect of action probin there let us a steevscholees and jordan decide that they are going to silizon neither of us is going to take the speakersho position unless we clawbacks from the powers thae mc carthy gave to gates and crew well alli's going o take that point it is for some one to swing in from the right and sa noi'll give you wht every one i'll giv you at every one and all i takes again is for gates an cretosave wel they are going t give us more power w'l go with them the insist of the incentive systems here are completely missaline even arnty chair woman at rona madaniel li think has done over all a pretty herrific job and the reason i say that is because when you lose consistently election after election twenty eighteen twenty twenty twen tweny one twentytwenty two i do not no ho you aintain your job but apparently this is the new way republicans do things the more you lose the more we are loyal to you or something in any case you areis ron aron na madaniel talking a talking about all this you blame mack dates an the the the rapples on on the conselative side should they have not taken this step in ther frostration im going to be a happy warrior caton mc carthy and i len o say let us just get the besis of the american people dine let us get the speaker of ot dine let us make sure we do not have this muss on the va ca san we do not have caas the gan we cannot do this rats car we cannot do this and wen if this happens again we are japadize japardizing a very small hosmitarty o an she is right about that but the probeat is all of these insentives have now been created you are better off being the free radical than you are being the person who actually cares about the party achieving victories and whether or not you it this was a pattern set by donald trumpen twenty sixteen he ran directly against the re publican party i understand the'r llowd people hare very upset with the quotin establishmeng re publican party i'm upset with them to i thnk they spent to much oney i thnk they caved on socialishes i think alot of the form policy is bat however this notion that you can simply buch the entire system and that this somehow benefits the entire system i've get to see that bar real results what are what or the real results of that whit where are they by hei lek i've to see them victory is promise let us he some victories achieved in a second we will get to the democratic part in all this pluss the blow back first when you are runing business youre

had pledge that they would basipally bail him out with the with the madgates crew if they brought this votion to replace the speaker he mentioned this yesterday after we ad won the majority a had became speaker lest and manthy pollocy came to meshy with speaker the time on the way out i toldr i was havin at issues with giin enough vote what is the promis that they want this one one person can wilyout she was the only speaker that change fe i had the power to call the vote on her but i never would i lost them votes because of it ah tis she said just give it to always back you up i may the same off for de baner the samthink to a paul could i believe in the institution think could they was a political decision by the democrat i think i thank the things they have done in the past hurt the institution they jus started removing people from committee they du started doing the other things thatmi thear is the institution felt he happens you wriht about this now is te smar i did place your trusto nancy plucy of course is a very stupid idea to place your trust i nancy polucian to day i'm seeing alout a of hue and cry from the right side of the howe that supports mc carthy saying well why did not nancy but whi did not the democrat stepping the democrats cod a save mc carthy be cause this entire vote you' for all the talk about rhinos who was eight re publicans who voted along with all the democrats to remove mac carthy and yes nancy plosy could have carved off in o five votes and she got a save mccarthy and then the institution woul have continued to move on as normal but why ould you trust democrats to do that what in your record makes you think the nancy plloce whos evergn aballyat whell the predictable result of this is that again more norms are broken there are certain norms in the house of representatives thathave just gone by the wayside is mcarthy mention radt theyre one of them is that you do not remove members of the other party from their comittees just cause you do not them he recall they actually did this the democrats removed certain republican members from their part of front from their committees even though they really did not have power to do an to republicans have now threaten to do the same two democrats as they shot the garic swallwo shul ot be on the indell commttee for example ill han o marsh not be on the forn affairs comitee i get look a but the rule was he did not do that and the democrats broke dhat rull ind our re publicanstrign o break that rill in kine will now republicans are taking thei revenge on the democrats by i victing them from their higdway offices according to s bes news two long time democratic leaders representive nancy pollocian stinijhoyr have been a victed from their alled highway offices in the capital in the after math i've kevmac carthyse asters house speaker polozy con firmed on tuesday night the represent of patric mc henry the new speaker protem has order she immediately vacate my office in the capital this a viction is a sharp departure from tradition said pollocy ol my gadly listening to nancy pollocy catter wall about tradition is is laghable this lady who is kneeling in can take coff in the halls of congress as speaker i gave former speaker hasterd a significantly larger sweet of offices for as longas you wish office base does not mattered me but it seems to be importan to them now that the new republican leadership has settled this important matter but's hope they gets work on whats truly important for the american people now again the highway offices the vary in size and location some are windowless rooms on the basement level others have high cealings shandaleaders big windows the highway office of the late sentor rober berb was is really really nice office is not clear why they were toss but the evictions we are probably in revenge by the republican caukas for the democrats basically allowing gates to hold up the entire process alexanderocazo cortes for her parchas ye chce she does not care bout the institution of congress she tweated out does any one believe for one minute mccarthy woud help elected dem speaker quotinquoed for the institution mccarthy subers is a theme he loudly stated he would not no go sho with democrats called virtually known trash those who helped with thes s are and then expected demvotes for free well an then she continues of mccartha cared much for the institution he would not have open a baseless and peachm ot thoat a house vot the care for the institution wouldn' have voted to over trn election results who have honoured his det limit deal with the president and all the rest o ca sot again i understand hardnos potics but what goes round comes round and that is the wy tht is going to be mean this is the er in which we live any rule the democrats break is going to be met with equal an opposite firer by the republicans and frankly i'm totally fine with that a'm totally fine with that democrats broke the tradition in terms of judicial momines suggesting that they could ram tpeople through with the fifty one vote majority manch maconall and put three of demo froms nominees on the supreme cord with just over fifty votes democrats decide to break all the rules of a gard comittea simons for publicans will responding kind is just going to be this this is going to be the way that it is because all trust between the parties is gone and just one second will get to what comes naxt two exactly even wants to be speaker of the house seems a really rapy job will gets that in just one moment first imagine for just one

consirded ral firebrand heis very closely allied with donal trump but unclear if the left wing of the party is going to support jim jordan he ends out being close with mac carthian was upset when he when he got tosset jordan has some early indorsements from de isa of californi toms maskive kentucky gen banks of indiana all all which are good endorsements obviously and then there is a third member onclhoma representative chaven hern he also is is running for the position he is the chair of their conservative re publican study committee he said he had not made an official announcement also chip roy might get in again unclear how all this is going to shake out at this point none of this manners if they do not actually change the rules in that there needs to be a chang ing the rules and terms of who can actiur just get rid of somebody the motion tovacate the chairs thof walster journal points out used against mcarthy is get to hang over te had of the next speaker mac carthyallied den't

ceaven om believing govern with these aid people others say the changing te rule be a condition for their support represent of carlos hamennas of florida he said the person who wants my vote for speaker has to commit to reforming the motion to maca because nobody can actually govern under tese particular circumstances now the the truth is that mac carthe again representative representaccount of the center of the of the republican party hich e could say that there is one he as very trumpy but at the same time he was in favor of increased eights you crane but if the partygen want the ae you craine whos carvot out of the siar he asshould pretty representative of of what the republican cock is wanted all these are the pople o pretty strong positions scolees has been working behind the scenes to replacemac carthy as speakeor trying to shore up support according to fox news diginal after housema jorty uf ton emmer suggested scleese to make a good speaker scholese told reporters that he did not have anything to announc we will see how all of this moves for meanwhile the knives are out for gates and now on unjesty on a pure carmac level he deserves it he cause what he is doing here is absolut gran standing as a mentioned over and over again it is stupid counter productive it does not actually achieve anything sentor markwane mullin of oglahoma when after macgates in a kind of different way yesterday he talked a little bt about makates the a the personality the are thang about thi sky a this is a gui tat did not have thathe mediate in give a time at day to after he was accuas ta sleepin with a under aghe girl but there is a reason why no one and the corpres came to fin of him because we had all seen that vidios he was showin on the housefloor that all tis had walked away of the girls that he has slept with he drag about how he would a crush ety medicon an and and chase it with a with an energy durink he can go all night this is ogusyn before hyeu got married and when that accusation cannot no one to finitim and than no one on the medi would gim a time the day all sad he found fame because he opposed the speaker of the house back in november and he is always staye there and he is not he was never on the leave and till he got this last moment o fame by sand y by goon after a motion to vacate it is important to no consman gates has never been charged with any sextrafting in crime any gave the samement to sand in response i do not think markwane mullin and i have said twenty words to each other on the house floor theres a li from someone who does not know men whos coping with the death of the political curis friend ceaven thoughts enpr soud things are gin gat uglier and things are alsicg n that stupider one of the big suggestions thet came out once the speaker was vacated was at donald trump for the speaker of the house i'm sorry this is clown chostuff it is'just clownish it is clownish and ridiculous ton trum for speaker the hase now technically houn' nave to be a member of the house to be speaker of the houstonal trump what are you kitting me you thnk's non a whip votes donn' trump is going to fund raye on behalf of members of the house that yo gave no money during the last election cycle to anyone who is not name donal trotlicg what are you even talking about have we had enough sufficient shows of of sick of fantic bootlicking frum members of the republican clack as yet that we have to actually talk about this kind of nonsense seriously you vote for trump for president that is fine donal trump did alout good things as president speaker of the house a gis any anybody who suggests this should be summarily laughed at it is ridiculous i'm sorry to stupid on itst faces they has no governing experience in the congres is not a single legislative procedure works he has spend his entire career they sicallye dividing republican against republican he achieved a massive victory against tolorclan he did wonderful things as president and he also wuld be the worst speaker of the housethat lik what are we cen talking about this ay come on be serious for five seconds that trump was the asked about whether he would take the job and here he was che republican members of congress i or tot not marcha tailor created toit nowll thiy there canat back trump first speakerhe dead way in i on that this lorning tak a lessthen trump then promptly went on su truth social and treated a picture of himself holdhing the speakers gavally ih you knother people in th united sateswho actually rely on the federal government i'm not talking about people horon well fram time oulic people who are in business and want a predictable regime i'm talking about people who do not want to see the national that blown out i'm turn out people wo ould just to go about their daily laughsithout worrying about the chaos clown circus that is congress and is this helpful margery tailor green again one of our brightest lihtes ishe tweated out that you would only support donall trump the only candidate for speaker m crornently supporing his president onal trump he will end the waren you crane he will secure the border he will end the politically wevon as goverment by thay he did not do any of these things as president of the inveted states just go point that out he din't secure the border he did not end the politically bebonized government he w'll make a american energy independent again he will pass my bill to stop transgender surgeries on kids and keep men out of womens sports he will support or military by mornerng hosecan dos is speaker he is dont a run the senate shat's wa your es o can be president if he is the speaker and sol much more he has a proven for your record as president of the united states of america he received a reckor number of republicant votes of any re publican p residential candidate we can make him speaker an thentalect tim president he will make america great again says margery tilegrie margery he is notcin a datyo i seriously what in the what stop being clowns for five seconds just stop it just stop bein i know it is too much as first party to sanity winds first party it sanuines meanwhile president trump on the presidential level continues to be bog down with this ridiculous fraug case in new york again the the this frog case is based on specious assortions tand because donal trump inflated the value of his real estate assets in negotiations with banks and then banks a nection rely on thos inflated valleys in order to make lones that somehow this anouncs to fraud which is every single person engaged in real estate in new york if you want to go about at this way i here is donal trum correctly saying they have weaponized justice and also you notice that were trong about donal trump in the contect of his on legal troubles and not in a name that has not been mention far this entire sho jobton why because when re publican set themselves on fire and then jump through circus hoops it turns out every one talks about them and not jobidin while jobiton is busy pummeling the american economy i know i hear is the eris donal trump going off about to the weaponization of justice which of course he is right and also this isn' matrobiton jhe is riht he is right and also again what are we not talking about we are not talking right now about jobiton meun wile again trump continues to be by far far and away the pull leader in the club house right now for the republicans the latest at national average has non al trump at fifty seven per cent and the closest competitor around a sant at fourteen latest economist ugov pollh just com aut yesterday has trump at fifty eight and to santis at thirteen if you look at the state levels it is a little bit closer they aven't hade enough state polling in iowa frankly at this point the sanse has goneabout fifteen million dollar infusion hes putting it all into ie wle he is moving his entire staff into iwa the current pulling in i wa still has donal trump om up on the field by thirty points in new hampstir dona trump is still up on the field by thirty point the lates joust say today suffolk pole actually has nicke hily jumping into second place against to ronto santis that pull does have a margin of error of four and a half per cent or in the real clor posics pulling average spasically trump and the a group of people haily at fourteen per cent to sants at ten per cent pristy at nine per cent bona line is there is no one challenger to trump at this point which means we can we talk about these issues as i say over an over again if is your bat is your bat i do not leans great strategy but apparently strategy is of no impacts at this point which is which is really exciting meanwhile tobiding is running this economy into the ground a plain without wings we get that momentarily first let' say that you have in employe now we will call him at walch and let us say an that i he is done

up until a few years ago when we lives in california we are annual passholders over at disneyat is the best place to go with your eds i have picturers of myself with with my on parents when i'm a small kid at isney land my fourth day wif my wife was a dsney land loved disney product big disney fan up until they decided a few years back to they were going to go completely woke they aregoing to move to th left they are oing to start in jecting bonch of el g b t k plus minus ovid by sine messaging into teir programming particularly for kids and this is despicable stff becaus you are taking legacy properties when youare still make your money off for legs properties while simultaneously promoting a woke left weing a genda that target's children tat is what disney has been doing well now this raspmes an reports survey shows that sixty per cent of re publicans have an unfavorable opinion of disney including thirty five per cent in say thy've a very unfavorable opinion that servey was conducted in t late september only thirty two per cent re publicans have a favorable view for democrats the results are precisely the opposite because of course for lot of democrats their perfectly happy with spoon feeding a bmunch of leftist trobes into children's programming then again this is no surprise there is another study they came out just yesterday from glad glad as the game les bean

binus vi by sign inclusive in fact according two their statistics they give hem a forty one per cent ratin which tha good rating they made fifty nine total films twenty four of them where l g b t plus manist about by sign inclusive forty one per cent which is next to warm brothers discovery the highest rate they are one of only three studios that received a good rating from it glad and again all of this is is design for a purpose an the purpose is particularly when comes to a kids company disney two target children ands one thing for netflics to do this sort of stuff neflics is largely designed not for children but whall disney is designed explicitly for children it is films lite er which bombs at the box offise largely due to the fact that one of the ajor story lines was bout a les bein couple it is about the fact that disney has decided that they wish to in the words of one of their own animators sledge hamer you with the not at all secret gayagenda okan meanwhile jobidon is doing a herrific chopigan we have now been through most of to day sho and not mention jobide how is that possible when the president of the united states is running the economy into a ditch how is that possible the answer is when republicans once again kick themselves in the balls repeatedly every one point to laugh the guy kickng himself at balls even if the building behind that eye is completely one fire and children are running and screaming leke that that is how it works that is how it works in any case jobidon continues to be terrible at is jobhes yes yesterday how to confront family members ware mago family members and here is jobian it his most convincing and carismatic how to vise those people who do serior concers but maybe warry about talking to a mage parit neber porker how abothin to do at po wo but i also think that we should begaging people war in o not not been worryiend abotour naibor talk to siten say what wat you think why why i not can arguments butca this is wan you say this but how bout this force people to getin and to a conversation well that is that is riveting stuff there from the dead presidents of the united states when these say dead presidents the manyou kow the guison dollar bills now we astually mean the president of the united states who is a walking sonby at this point meanwhile the economy headed for disaster according to the walstry journal the uess has long been the lender of last resorts o the world during the emerging market panics of the nineties the globill financiral crices of two thousand seventy two thousand nine in the pantemic shut down of twenty twenty those treasuries unmatched capacity to borrow that came to the rescue now the treasury itself is a sorce of risk know the united states is in devacit defaults or fail to sell enough bonds at its next oction but the skalle and upward trojectory of yus borrowing ind the absence of any political corrective now threatens markets and the economy in wayes they have not for leasty generation that is the take away from a sudden a sharp rises in treasury yields in recent weekes the usual suspects cannots explain it the in flation picturehas got marginally better the federals or of his signaled it is nearly done at raising rates instead most of that increases due to the part of yields called the term premium hich has nothing to do with in flation or short from rates numerous of factors affect that term premium rising government steffisits are a prime suspect suffs it is hae been wide for years now why should they matterate now the better question is what took long that larger deffs its push up at long from rates had long been economic orthodoxy but for the past twenty years interestraht models that incorporated i physical policy did not work no to recardo tresy former fet economist that is understandible central banks hand kept intrest rates round zero while buying up government bonds that was in flations quantitate of easing they just pumt money into the system privates man fral credit was week this trumped any concern about s effisits mark we meen sen or managing director black rots as we had twenty five ut blissful years of not having to worry about this problem but to day central banks are worried about in flation being too high they have stopped buying in some case of their shetting at their bond holdings suddenly fyscal policy matters again again s i've said a thousand times whatever goes up starts to come down and that is true when it comes to the american economy when you in fleet things they tend to burst when you in fleet a bubble it tends to burst right now no one wants to buy you esse at whiht is known wanted by you estat whell the answer is be get ther bunch of answers one reason is tbecause if the fad to fight in flation asto continue increasing rates that means that the bond that you bought yesterday is no longer worth money why ell because the bond that is coming out to morrow has a higher face yield that is why the yields on bonds are increasing bond yield by thewy when i sa the ell abot is it what i mean is the price of bonds is dropping typically speaking interest rates and price of bonds workin invers proportion as interest rates go up the rice of bonds drops why seems counter intuit of the answer is because people are woried the next increase interest rate increase makes the last bond worthless this what ave na silikan vallebank rat they banked on a certain fashal rate of interest on the bons they bought and then the fad sare to issuing bonds and a much higher rate and all the bonds thae silican valle bank was banking on were now worthless could not sell them in the open market meanwhile at the same exact time that the federal reserve is the initry in creasing those interest rates there the're trying to sell bonds in the market m the tringsul uns of bonds into the market which also under cuts the price why the sung bonds in te market because of the deffisit because of the debt this is going to be a serious problem the federal defts tht was over seven per cents of gd p in fiscal twenty twenty three after a justing for accounting distortions related to student debt tht is larger than any deficit since nineteen thorty outside of wars in recessions this eccurring at a time of low on employment in strong economic growth suggesting that i normal times when things aracturally wors defts its are going to be a lot higher by the way it is worth noting at this point thet china an japan are not buying our debt in the way that they were according at to roiters foreign holdings of yust treasuries rose in july riseing for a second straightmonth despite an un certain interestrat outlook muddied by mixed set of economic figures china stash of treasuries however drop to eight hundred twenty one penty billion dollars the lowisins may of two thousand nine annalis said that china has been under pressures to defendits weakening currency and he sellig of your stebt may ve been used for intervention purposes to prop it up s ther putting more of our bonds old bonds on te market which floods the arket with american debt which means thirer to raise te debt which means that we have to increase those interest rates that we are giving people in order to get them to by the debt which means were can hae to pay off those new interest rates at a higher rate of interest meanwhile jrobidon keeps spending into this because he is a more on yesterday preside en bidan announce student debt for giveness for another tranch of americans on wednesday months after the suprimecort blocked the administrations most ambitions at borrow relief plents thi un constitutional it is our been declared he cant unilaterally simply get rade of studelon debt he is doing it anyway because this'is what he does the string of politically advantageous an ouncsments comes thanks the administrations use of existing programs tat allow the government to wave debt for certain borrowers the moves oure separate from the administrations trouble the tom to cancill as much as twenty granin student debt for any brrower earning less than a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars year struck down by the supreme court wednesday's announcement of nine billion dollars and student debt cancillation for a hundred twenty five thousand borrowers the latest in a string of sizible discharges helps just a small slace of the more than forty million people who owned abt but again this is part of the inflationary policy of this administration is to basically blow monion to system by relieving debt the administration is touting those cancillations on the same way on the same week most borrowers wreturn to making payments for the first time since they were paused in march at twenty twenty as part of the covenineteen pantamic relief the pecemel approach to dbt cancillation as up the administration has now wiped out one hundred and twenty seven billion dollars in student debt tnearly one third of the projected cost of the failed mass cancilation plan the suprime ports as he cannot do it jobine just finds anotherwaye to it that is the way this works meanwhile mortgage rates are hiting seven point five per cent the real estate market is beginning to tank because again there is no one out there to buy up the real state is being put on the market and right now there is no inventoryes a weird sticky situation yu're not con a sellur house to get into an eit per cent mortgage whe you have a four per cent mortgage on your house right now there is not lot of inmentory ste prise arn'treally dropping cause he're not alot of inventory but if the wore inventory the prices would be dropping his no bcan a for to buy the stuff that is can come ungluded a certain point hat certain point tpeople arncun be able t make tdor mortgage on the four per cent house then i can go pay that an there can be forced to sell the house and once that starts happening then ing is h o real stake crash th morgage applications by e way our plummiting for just this reason at the exacting time that all of this is happening jobidon is presiding over massive strikes affecting the american economy the auto worker strike is still not ben resolved meanwhile kaisar permanente is now on strike this the largest to ust health car walk out onrecord that is jus what we need right now in time of rising at cost is we need all of the health car workers walking ou e cornings tho whallster jornal more than seventy five thous and nurses farmasists and other employs of kaier prom nente walked off the job wednesday ind the largest just healtcar strike onrecord the workar struck after contracts expirers and their unions could not reach an a grim with kiser ond how much new deal would increase

place s rorled by labor action this year wything this is happening whyse this happening well people states the tyghtlabor market's onttile market the tight labor market autom autically drives up the price of labor the reason there striking is because jo bidon is in the white house and in his tirat is ministration is in hock to labor unions that is why they know that the secretary of labrs can in jet on in and kram something down on kaiser kaiar by the way sers almost thirteen million at members at forty hospitals on more than six hundred and twenty medical offices the mork stopage involves kaiser workers in faive states and washington d cy it is the largest action by healthca worker since nineteen ninety three kaser unions said inflation has a roded employe wages whose valts os

cost of livig is not matching the corewages we are losing the people kaiser said its compensation leads its markets and the company has already increase hiring the reason these strikes are happening again is because jobidon is precidents of the united states that is the reason the jobidon it he is presiding over all of this he owns this economy bynomics is all of this it is helf care strikes it is you a w strikes is a failure to be able to be able to sell american bonds at the at the rates that are necessary to even be able sustain are dect economic stagnation is the real thread of the of of the bi dministration i said this for at least the year to haf at this point the threat is not in flation the inflations bad inflations terebrle the realthread is economic stagnation built off inflation hihe interest rates regular tory strictness labor unions all of that is just stand is to stand in in the mill it is sticking up all of the wheels of the economy and jobidon's response will for every single part of that in meanwhile jobidons in such serious political trouble that he starting just implementonnals trums plans right now according to te associated press the bine administration announcs tot wave twenty six federal laws in south texas to allow borderwall construction on wednesday marking the administrations first use of a sweeping executive power employed often during the trun presidency wait are you sing now there is a crisis on the border i sing that people are rushing the border are you now saying that maybe it is a good idea to build the wall jobiton i thouht was really bad where is ao s crying at the border where is she in her white out fit crying at empty parcing lots where is she thet a partment of home land security post of the announcement on those federal registry with few details outlinein the construction in star county texas which is a busy border patral sector seeing high illegal entry according to goverment data about two hundred forty five thousin i legal entries have been recorded far this fiscal year in just the reo grand balley sector which count which contains twenty one counties a ahontheromaorcus who should absolutely be impeached heis not doing his job he said thereis presently an acute an immediate need to construct physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the border of the united states in order to prevent u mawful entries into the united states in the projecareas i love how far they are going to just not sey the word wall pretty amazing right construct physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the border do you mean a border wall is that what you are trying to say star counties hillty ranchlands sitting between zapoti mac allen texas is home to about sixty five thousand residents although no maps were provided in the announcement c b p announced the project in june and began gathering public comments an august when it shared a map of the edditional construction that can ad up to twenty miles the existing border barrier system in the area i now it is a it is jobidon who is building at the wall during the trump administration about four hundred fifty miles of wall were built along the south west borer between twenty seventeen and january of twenty twenty one texas governor gragabbit has ben doing it himself the d chest is decision on wednesday contrasts the bine administrations postering when a proclamation to and the construction on january twenty twenty twenty one quote building a mass of all that spands te entire southern border is not a serious policy solution a good to see that ta jobine has been clocked in the face by reality o a time for some things i and then some things that i hate things that i william lank creggor recommended his books on the programme t before i he hou writes a lot about logical proofs of god now i havenan entirevitio and my series to bong to ire talk where i talk about plausible logical proofs forgot i think any of them are dispositive or inarguable of course not i do not think that you can logically prove that there is a god i do think that you can suggest that there are very logical arguments to suggest a god i think tha you can say that there is a prevalence of the evidence that suggest that there is a god and again i actily do not think that most people come to god by being argued into its wit that sad one of thus expositors of the sorts of arguments is william l ang crag is a cristian apologist his a great book alle the coloma cosmological arguments asshu based on ancient islomic sourcis it is discussd in mymonities the colom cosmological argument is all about the idea that there is a first cause to the universe and wilang cragets very detailed in this this is one of his more sophisticate booksals has munch thei're directed the more general reader totally worth the wort the reed william lang crags the colom cosmological argument go check it out to day ok cae time for some things that i hate pope francis seems wildly un concerned about human sin but he is very concerned about climate change again i'm not a catholic i do not have a dog in this fight other than his member of western civilization i think that the catholic churcs the catholic church moving away from its traditional rootes in terms of morality is a massive mistake tat is going to lead to extraordinary sital consequences pope francis putting outsized impact on what he term social justice which is to say redistributionist economic and then he is adding on to that climate changing hes alike his top priorities meanwhile he is talking about how may be maybe maybe priest should beable to give blessings to same such unions which of course is weird sin some omosecua out i homosecual activity in the biboleisisin and catholic church has always said that but now pope francis foks sing lazer on climate change pope francis on wednesday according to the near times once again implored the world to protect the suffering planet lamencing n a major new document that scanp progress have been made the eight years since he refocus the roman catholic church more fully on environmental issues in a land mark treatise the catapulted him to the forefront of climate actibism in the near decates incs global fand for plaudits from leaders and talk of a game changing shift for the church greeded franceis first calle to confront climate change things have only gotten worse well yah becue as it turns out yo massive collective action problem when it comes to climate change schina ain'signing on india ain signing on is unclear what level of actual midigation of the amount of of carbon movins the atmosstore result in what amound of actual lowered climate overtime those are pretty stemaic barriers also you are the pope should not you really be worried a lot about saving souls and human sin shouldn' that be the biggest thing tht your focust on well francisis message remained the same his voice has faded wednesday's document an aw postolic exhortation called loudate daum or praise god amounted to a tacit acknowledgement that francis initial appeal to save the planet has gone largely unheeded he says once and frogt let us put an end to the irresponsible dirision that present the tissue as something purely ecological green romantic frequently subject to ridicule by economic interests well i mean it is green and romantic if you re anactualy ofe a plan to effectuate the thing or if the lan to effectuate that thing means people enveloping countries have to live in abject poverty or if your idea is let just rect western aconomy noneof that stuff's can o happen agan pope pope francis mus to say not my favorite pope already gos the rest the sho continues right now your nocconortomisit will be getting into a sitting

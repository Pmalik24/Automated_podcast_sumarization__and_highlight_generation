a quick worning there are curse words that are unbeeped interdays episode of the show if you prefer a beep tergion you can find that at our website this american life tat work is this american life i am themide on me in for iro glass this week back in early april when we were still only a few weeks inte lock down in new york a friend of myne asked me what things were on planet bim it was a joke but it was one of those accurate jokes because living alone right now is probably not that dissimilar to being a far away solitary planet new york was one of the first places to lock down and in a way i'm still living its march i work from home i leave for groceries i attend almost no social functions and it is not that i do not know how to be alone being alone even in a crowd is not new to me the move continents when i was very young living between the yuquet and nigeria i went off to boarding school when i was ten years old i left home forte university when i was nineteen and i never really move back home again ie lived in london lay gus burlin and now new york i chose to live in those last two places to move far away from family and home but there is something different about the loneness of bright now coveid nineteen has taken away that element of choice a nine year old being sent up to her room as punishment versas sitting in her room quietly reading anyway the activities are the same but the issue is control many of us have been dealing with this and forced and loneness a lotmore since the pandemic began sometimes i feel i'm plating through space a sorts of dwarf planet and a galaxy that seems to be populated by planets with people attached children a partner other family members maybe even housemates or a pet i have none of those things at the moments my family my parents my siblings their partners there rule in london about three and a half thousand miles and a full ocean away and basically a caricature of the elder melennial it is just me and an ever growing collection of house plants and candles nd as i kept thinking about space and about distants i realized oh i'm not a planets i'm an astronaugt if feels no one is psychically if not physically further away from their loved ones and an astronaugt in orbit i found an astronaugt just a compare notes with leroy chow he is retired now from nasser but altogether he spent more than seven and a half months in spce can i can ask a a child's question now you can you be bored in space lie is it is it is it different to earthbordon i think you you wand pritt this way we do have a lat to do even if alon the work is tedious work it still work it has to be done and hasly don protiscasual and wand down if we did not havrady would be a later difficulties in thoug you rea fitacular view of the irithan you taking phrotograph of all these great places im after a while if you did not have it ave to do tha be be pret ough the answer is yes i think he wousd say yes you can absolutely get board in space even though they keep them quite busy neroy told me something i had not known at the end of every day all the activities on the international space station had to be locked and every single day base on that log the plan changed for you even watch of wors six months pace mation every minute of your you your mission has be't plannd out taking into carol requirements constraint a i alreadyse things that and then you get up there and you streck the first day with day one eand then at the end of your day you have got a long don the computer the things that you finishe thinks you got ahead on things you may be gat behind nim and then why you sleep the entire a planning team on the ground in the mish control center is replanning the entire mission based on what happened that day and then ripple and all way through to the end and then the send up a new fight pan and the next morning when you get up you get a new fight plan on your computer i because of this this replanning teen that that has to do this every night i love that it fell to a whole crew of people at an entirely different location to plan minute by minute everything that a person should be doing with their hours e breakfirst and clean up between o six fifteen and o six forty five hours a fifteen minute conference with mission control after experiments sleep for eight hours some months a check in make sure youre on task fortunately unlikelyroy i have no mission control the usual order of my day has been disrupted since march we no commute my desk is now only a few feet away from my bed my sleeps yetul is messed up a friend of my said we should stop calling at working from home but rather living at work everything feels its drifting and not just in my apartments it bee nicof some one seemed to have a bit of a plan globerly speaking when leroy and i first spoke it was april and at that point i've been alone in doors for about six weeks i remember it as i slightly feril time i joke that i wished i thought to trap a boy friend before the pandemic hit some kind of human space junk to occasionally bump into in my apartments but then leroy told me about the perils of cohabiting in space i tack to some the cas when ast you had been raund for a long time an we said some cruse came back and they said if i had had a weapon if i had a gon i would have killed my crume we yes that' how bad it can yet i have no tention with my house plants my candles burn but not with any malice i hactually really living alone s not that i wont to fight with any one i just wish i had the auption some times break glass in case of bordem ou leoroy's longestint in space came when he lived on the international spac station with only one other person salisan charibaut a curgistany cosmenaut for a hundred and ninety two days if a context my personall expedition is currently around a hundred and thirty days part of the terror of being alone right now as that this pandemic feels endless i asked leroy went things began to feel really impossible for him was ever time in space when that itch to be home became unbearable i would say right around a for a month point three fourmont seems to be cannof the righter moun of time if you ask most astronat that is when you saying wel ow this is greates is this is interesting it sir it is sat fulfilling but i sure in my going harmeiter ha ha ha a ha ha ha ha ha n and when you star getting eager you home is actually after the next true arives you hav generally baut a week we can i have to gavit before you go home in the next crue rise and you strik it really ecided about going home and ast for the time seems to to cr ha ha han a a my rast at last week or that make sense to me even in the majesty of space four months is still four months four months of being alone of being far away it is hard and four months is werwere at in this new reality were ready to come back to us but we do not know one will be allowed to go home the still no cure no vat scen and a steady increase in new cases what do we do to day were going to hear from people whove had time to think about their aloneness all their loneliness even when they 're in a crowd how to be in astronaut or a solitary planet when there is a whole gallant just around ther corner how to be alone that is the feeling of to day's program th bb b easat chicogo its this american life on the not y would me stay with me actme the unbearable bont when isolation and social distancing was still new i read a leta and it felt pages fom my diary i had not even known i was writing it was published in this awonder review back in april the writo daniel evans a learning boltimal seemes to sinthislize the feeling of a learnness and loss and fear that i had not yet been able to even alticulate his daniel reading a version of that letta who was every one's last real human touch a friend asked at a sume birthday party in late march i cida name but once every one hung up i thought again not shor f i remembered correctly i walked myself through that last real day of emen contact the first week of march on the last day of a w p and annual writer's conference i ha planned to fly to san antonio a day and a half early to treat a friend that a difficult year to a preconference spawday but in the days litting up to the conference fear of the viros spread thousands of people including my frien cancelled their travel plans i cancelled the spoda out of prudence but my flight was departing as schedled and i would not get reinbersed if i did not get on it i decided to travel anxiously but i am anxious as a general condition one way to live in the world when you have anxiety is to get used to pushing at aside when it gets in the way of being alive this is my best explanation for why i trusted the city and the eir lines and the institutions who said it was still safe to travele and ignored te warnings of friends who said what was coming i thought florentine was still in it and weeks away if and i thought if loneliness was coming soon i did not want to be alone any longer than necessary the conference was part heptic work trip part carnival on its sfinal day tired after two days packed with events and panels i slept in and stayed in bed for hours after i woke i finally made it as far as the hotel lobby intending to grab lunch but instead sptted a friend at the bar we spent a few hours day drinking having in meyanduring conversation about our novels an major life decisions e feel settled i said believing it the sarendipity of the afternoon blood in to the evening i spent the day moving from crowded space to crowded space running into friens making plans for later in the night or the month or the year late in the evening a group of us headed to the conference's dance party but when we all went upstairs the dance floor was hilariously heart breakingly empty it already felt a medaphor downstairs people began to peel off we were tired fights were early it was starting to be unavoidably clear that we were in the before of something terrible and on the wrong side of caution i remember who was there i remember that some people were already conscientiously not hugging or touching that some people were there who i did not know well enough to ug who was the last person who leaned into me to say good by who was the last person besides me to realize the party was over two days after i returne to baltimore the canpas where i teach was closed immediately and indefinitely i prepared myself for the city to shut down for about a month i walked a block to buy extra catfood and then a block more to stock up on cannd and dried goods and for reasons unclear to me essential oils at my tiny and mysterious neighbourhood helt food stor i reand stated the service that mailed me a box of vesh vegetables weekly a month past the virus had not piqued yet april in may past i kept waiting for a clear sign that the worst was over but instead felt we were all trapped in the opening half of a harr movy by the time the citys stay at home order lifted in early june little seemed to have change to make me feel better about being in crowds or wriding the city bus or sharing in door space with people it is tolie now and most weeks i only go as far as my apartment buildings front entry way to collect mail an occasional groceries and bring them inside to disan fact in more exciting weeks i venture down the firescape to take out the resicling and walk around the block to come back in through my front door though for three weeks a recic ling was on hold because of an outbreak in the bureau of solid waste and i stelp to making even that small trip in over three months i have seen six delivery people two neighbours in the hallway one friend making a mask to front door grosery drop off one repair man one stranger me to detowar the property and my landlord as time passes there are fewer unbearable days but they are worse when they come i had a running joke for years about how none of my surbival skills would be useful in an apoccalips but it turns out being anxious and alone in my apartment waighing which things i love or worth the possibility that they might hurt me is the one nareo i was somewhat prepared for at the start of the year i had been looking forward to spending some time alone i was on teaching leave for the spring samuster nd i thought it would be a luxury to be mostly at home for a while i love my apartment i bought myself a smart make and taught myself to it anticipating as season when i would become a creature of odd habits an hours and would not on a walk to the jim after dark or in the spring rain i was preparing to hihbernate and not mismuch now i miss many things i take red him in deep hills and sometimes hover over the fire escape ledge standing beside the trashcan to try to get some sunlight and imagine the luxury of having a back yard i miss my father who was a forty minute train righte away the train feels out of the question and i cannot ask my father working full time from home and recovering from minor surgery to drive an hour each way just to visit i never learned to drive something i sometimes considered a badge of city dwelling honor earlier in the year i told a relative i did not need to learn to drive in baltimore when i live a short walk from penstation and at least a dozen city buses stop within a block of my apartment if i had a car and a licons i think now i could drive to wave at my father from a safe distance when the casual relationship i drifted in to early in the year just as casually evaporated i told a friend i guess we wernt that serious about it it is for the best now the scolding voice in my head tells me that a person who believed in chasing after things who did not think it was as clear as people yther want to be around you where they do not nd if you did not know which there was your answer well that person might not be alone in our apartment for months when i turne thirty five a few years ago i promised myself i let go of the idea that somday i was going to become a different kind of adult i let myself except that they would be no house or husband or baby or sudden mature ren a siation of glitter it was only the baby i really grieved but i let myself have that grief and move on i gave myself permission to live a life that was not waiting for my real life to start to free all of my intimate relationships from the emotional tyranny of a ticking biological clock to claim is a choice but what otherwise feel it had happened to me i thought it worked but the loneliness of isolations some days moxale of that makes all of my possible joys feel a femeral i ask wish of the things i promised myself i could still have casual flings travel community in the form of classumes and bookstores and coffee shops and bars will survive this or existin recognizable form when we emerge it is possible to feel stock with your choices even without wishing ye'd made any differently when i hear that this could go on for a year i think it is lack of human touch human contact that will break me and then i think it might actually be grief without the constant busy buzz of my normal life it is harder not to dwell in what is absent the lives i might have had the life i would have tis my mother were still alive i keep waiting for the first feeling i have that is wholly untouched by grief or that is at least its own fresh grief not marked by her death three years ago but it has not come yet when i heard the early descriptions of the viris of what it does to people's breathing i thought of my mother at the beginning of her illness when she went to the yare with undiig no stage for a cancer and a leader and a half of fluid in her lungs nd the doctor was playing to send her home with a laciive unsi my mother's friend a caiologe to the same hospital insisted they give her a cats gan i thought of my mother at the end when everything they would given her to keep the pain at bay to keep her unnotruly calm while her bodies every instinct told her to panic also meant she coun hold er had up to cosgh or vomit how many times shed said she did not want to de ho up to tubes when they first afked to intubate her her partnur said no how when i was alone with her later that day she began to choke saddnly awake and terrified and i held her hand i pushe the callbutton an knew we did not have that much time i ran into the hallway screaming for help an the nurse came running i stood in that hallway terrified my mother was going to die while i was in fact at the hospital by her bedside waiting for my mother to die just not that how i did not know for certain until after theyd wuth the tuban that had heard her voice for the last time in the first months of cuorentine sometimes in the middle of the day i would find myself sobbing and only realized later wy which bit of news trigered which memory the descriptions of what the viriss does to the body how many of the early faces of the dead were black women my mother's age or the infuriating financial politics of our healsecare sistem it was hard for me to untangl on a personal or national level the difference between a health crisis and the financial crisis when my mother's catscan came back indicating a problem before i could comfort her i had to ask her for her insurance card and step out in the hallway to call in a paiment because i knew if she got any further behind she would be uninsured i knew that because we would fought the week before when she told me she would stop paying her insurance she said the only thing wrong with me is high blood pressure and the only reason for that distress and the main reason i'm strest is money i side of there something else wrong by the time it it will be too late it was already too late when the virus first hit i thought of what hallot would have been for my sick mother after years of kemo and complications to have to adt of pandemic to her list of dangers i had the unbearable thought that it was a good things she did not have to live through this as time passed i thought more of my mother when she was well my mother who would have made it made me two weeks before calling to tell me she was coming to get me if she was coming to day but she was not letting me stay in my apartment alone for months what it is my apartment i would have said and she would have scoffed at my boundary is in comm anyway what i've been feeling acutely is the particular absence of the only person in the world who would have refused to leave me alone even when i absolutely wanted to be when i can step out of my personal grief for long enough i sumemone my mother's tenacity in the face of the more collective grief when the data on race began to come in it was not a surprise but it was devastating and also terrifying when i saw who was dying and i heard the narrative shift to personal responsibility i lost all faith that we would take this seriously enough for long enough i knew my country i thought and i was afraid that once at thought this was a blacken brown problem it would not blank at sacrificing gig workers and shipping plantworkers and service workers and food workers and city employes to have back the world of money and parties it would kill them and replace them for as long as it needed to even once the color of the faces started to change for months i felt my fear that black life was not worth much in this country was another form of a loneness which as why the shock of june's protest and the deaths that made them necessary felt horror and hope at once wlike we could say whatd had clearly been true all along even if we could not yet say for certain that it would change still i am terrified of getting sick because being sick alone means it may be too late when i realize hou sick i am i am terrified of having to go to the hospital alone because everything i know says there is no point going to the hospital if i'm not well enough to quedential myself i do not have any particular health rust factors for this virus except that i find doctors trestful and my blood pressure spikes the beginning of any doctors visit if the doctor is willing to yumor me and take it again my blood pressre is almost always normal and the filsos i have anxiety if the doctor was not f the visit was upsetting thand the files has my blood pressure is elevated myle hy pretension if i got sick no one would say she is a professor who just achieved a peleton milestone and has a refrigerative fillaman milk and fresh vegetables in the book out soon and she clarks the apartments front oors every time she went to get the male someone would say hi pretension some one would say come rabidity some one would read the summarise tatistics and say thot one does not count she was basically dead anyway because this is the game we are playing with language one where i and most of the people in my family cannot count as dying of this because we are already not alive when i think this it is not a specially good for my blood pressure i add spite to my reasons to stay alive and well i greet my anxiety an old friend one who wants me to live along life and forgives me when i doubt her i alternate wih she mi pappy smart bik and the despair of twitter i whalt our new books to local bookstores before i'e finished the last batch i do not it what i can where i can work my way to the local tipcarbenmo looking for my bar tenders and baricedas in may hair dresser i talk to my father several times a week and recent years he has taken to be keeping in a county park near his house and he is pleased that he can time to his hives without violating social distance in guidlinds i am anxious to find a safe way to visit him i confess i am indifferent to visiting the bees i con gratulate my students on their accomplishments i read a friend's daughter books we assume and come away with a critical deeses on reform was needed an picy society my am most caucious friends in the city have not socialized an person in months either i regard with a fection and suspicion the invitations i do get for mask socially distance to gatherings as our restrictions relax i am a lot of people's good friend and no one's singular person and every time some one reaches out i think yes i would love to see you and no i cannot risk it if your solcial circle is already wide enough that i am included am trying to imagine the first day i will say yes i am trying to imagine when i can hug some one again and beyond that to the first day i will take touch for granted to the next time i will go some place and spend a day among friends again in leave not remembering which of the people i adore a said good by to last not conscious of the significance not conscious of the danger o e danniel evans is the otha of a shool story collection coled before yo suffocate you in fool self ac to a notion upont here is a way that laneliness cools to laneliness the more it the more likely you wat to see it in the world leny people can see things that other non lidly people my have missed lily sullivan has a story about that it takes place in a vost non human sitting literally no humans his lady seven years ago when i was just starting out in radio it did a story about the scientific discovery cause there was something about it that i wanted understand the guy e first notice this thing was name jo george on an island off the coast of washington state ye a ee and we wot for yno a mrav on that yrin you pnotion and by looking they are really listening this is the adis by the way me navy had these devices caled hydrophones that would listen to sounds in the ocean anything that myt pea sobe it sub jo had been doing it for decates tould basiclly identify any ocean sound by its wiggles on a chart the one day he saw something he never seen before i maring by all o just look the signal said that it might be a wale it seems ike ci s huge a blue whale or a fin whale judging by the characteristics of its call but the song this whale was singing was totally off e co ewal her wook o at or be lot of yo dout it wot e hor e do e on he tat e ar ot of ti i you or meaning the sound was over an octive higher than i should be and they can never detect any other whales with him these kinds of whales are really social animals they often travel together in groups called pods and usually when one whale calls out other wales respond calling back and forth to each other for miles away without that they never be able to find each other in a huge space the ocean but this wale and he called out no whale ever seemed to respond wut o you o o eo and yo r wit at y o holly wo a wit tat o in o o o no wut or wit i can actually play you recording of the call they picked up back then huge whales that fin whales or blue whales they'are among the loudest creatures on earth theire songs to each other rumble across the ocean they can hear each other from a thousand miles away but those same songs there are frequencies too low for most humans to hear but this wales call is high enough that most humans connexly hear it lots of speakers do not play sounds at such frequncies but see if you can hear him andif yeu could not hear that here to shifted up a bit to make it easear for scientist they thought this is useful usually it was almost impossible to track an individual whale because you pick up on theire entire pods they now they could follow is single whales my gration precisely and as they track the whale this joe realized the wale was in the wrong place roaming miles away from where other whales for my grating calling out all the time never see me to get a response where did this eventually made it out into the public a science writer for the new york times wrote a small story about it song of the sea acapella a non answered when people heard about this they thought my god or whale people wondered maybe other whales could not hear him because of his songs high frequency or maybe he could not hear other whales or maybe he is a high brid they bea cross between a fin an a blue i because he sounds strange other wales are afraid of him they do not respond one whales keep silent that is how whales hide there was just something about the idea of a creature moving through life constantly caling out to others and never getting a responss he seem fundamentally out o sink in away thi got to people i feld this way too it first heard about the whale five years before i talk to jo back then i spend a lot of time alone i actually had a job where i travelled twenty four seven for two years barely seeing friends or family or any one i knew i would evil myself passages i liked from books i could read them over and over here is one of them it is from a book by james salter he wrote in solitude one must penetrate one must endure the icy beginning is whare it is worse one must pass all that one must go forward all the way through bitterness through righteoust feelings advancing upon it a holy city sensing the true joy i still that idea loneliness as a thing you can get better at and that getting better at it wuld take you somewhere more true i stard to think of solitude is a project and on its to mas ter over time more and more people heard about this whale er remember seeing some one post about im on this book and within a day twenty thousand people wrote comments there ir h people who wanted to try to fix the whale ombers and ask why cannot we help it another wrote why cannot it be taed to something to read broadcast the calls at a lower frequency the answer use cannot people wrote music inspired by him this song i talk to guy and ireland who is going through a divorce his wife saw the stor ryon lin and emelt him a lank from where she was sitting in the next room another guy talk to me mixed tapes of the whales song n would male those tapes actual casetts to strangers who asked him for it someone in germany wrote a children's book heople imagined his wife in the icy depts swimming a hundred years along there we were all of us walking around dizzy in our own isolations connecting to this wale rather than to other people scientists called him fifty two herts the rest of us called him the loneliest creature on earth when i talk to joe he raised this issue that all those blogs kept overlooking and that i had overlooked too we have no idea if this wales alone at all just because we cannot hear other animals with him does not mean the're not there he could be swimming with another group of wales or with a group of females whose bocalizations do not travel as far there is of course one thing that could answer whether or not he is actually alone we could go look at him but actually all these years no one has ever seen him all we have is an idea of him hes just a sound in the oceanm even joe has not seen him he is only heard his calls jo told me back then it be next impossible to find him physically wi well we hav no do re lo for be lik look a for your e ter o ter why o yoko bid yo look can re look at fr won wall well obid youi that thar dd yo wr mile far fir for listening back to this interview male seven years after i recorded it i can hear myself fishing trying to see if there was any part of joe that thought about him the way i did has this an i guess this story for you is it mostly pure science for you or do you think do you think of this is personal as well well we are loke te wor fa e ti a wal e a i ofit we are scientific i can hear myself being disappointed here i keep trying do you feel the wale well well w yehad not a bit but o hat for have you ever been just mowing your line and all of a sudden maybe after he saw the blogs did you ever have a thought om maybe thit is a little sadder did you ever have a moment where you did think that it was the story was romantic in some way o well im wel in i ell joe told me we have no idea of he is lonely we do not even kno fwhale's get lonely we are all guessing himand since all we can do his guests here is another possibility maybe he is hearing other wales and af waiting them maybhe wants to be alone or maybe he does not mind i hope that is true me i do not think about him much any more i stopp thinking about him after i got a dog lily selevan is one of the produces of ocho se did hareadya story about the wale as pot of the transon story woksho coming out ad kid in tees and isolation with his mum he invents a game that is not exactly agame that is a loot rul life that is in a

again and i remember thin hang up with her and cossy up a storm beli what the fogly what eakechail starts texting messaging emiling what is going on to the rest of her teen i think i hung up the phone and immediately got another gall from avrailing yet maybe wit im i two or three minutes it was another mum from jilly frantic calls wereallso coming into lawyers from the other two detention senters all telling the same t general' story ice was asking families to sign something but the whole thing was really confusing some people were saying that they were not even shown a document some were told sign this it jus pruce we talk to you but other say ice was threaten them telling them that they had to sign no choice that the officers asked if they would give their child up for a doption in many cases the officers asked all of this in front of the kids within twenty four hours the lawyers from all three family tetention centers got on a giants zome call with press to sound the alarm arguing it was the legal to break up family this by asking parents to sign something tho could even understand a nice would not give the lawyers ta copy of the document ice did put out a statement shortly after this saying the officers were just going over a routine form with the detainies when de did hanks up with eachtel she looks over at her son who is been quiet this whole time eat an osinol o bes e i his little eyes were filled with tears he was worried sec he thought that he was geing to be separated from me and he told me do not sign becaus wherever he no i do get them while ye did was making the phone call the guards had started looking for her thet put her name an photo up on the screens that are all around the facility as soon as she stepped out of the phone room e guard recognise her made her go back to the trailer were all the other moms were with the ice officers when she gets there the officers look piss at every one not te ma hait a te sandlle not yet teeman an he other man e saying no one sign no one sign signaling for everybody to not sign and i mat a be onest i was telling the others that were there to not sign just to be clere did you sign not yout o fin a ma o as apparent you are supposed to be the one and charge it s an unspoken packed between you and your kid here the one who decides things but in detention much was out of you debt's control this was a rare moment where she got to at least say no messant teall foty lying animomenttut i fought i had an authority at that moment whend i was saying that to them but from thet on i felt how i felt i felt i was a' trembling this ot trembling took over my body eit a omi why what ges and the gay this af day tufy yes i felt i was defign an authority and i never thought that i would do something that there the department of ice and you cannot say noted that he as if they deside to ha you out of the country i mean we are in their hands or fomenan a harma bey i reached out to ice multiple times about this but they have not responded but the lawyers had talked to have a theory about why the ice officers were doing this though the government is not supposed to detain kids longer than twenty days but some families have been intetention for months there is this federal judge judge dolly ja who has been basically yelling at ice about this for a while she keeps getting more and more annoyed and a court dedline mus coming out the lawyers think ics was trying to cover their ass ask parent if they were willing to separate from their kids and when they said no well they could tell the judge it is the family's fault they will not release the kids we have to keep every one intetention but once a question do you want your kids to be separated from you is said you cannot rely unhear it and becomes part of your world for days after this happen a tehando and his friends could not stop talking about it they kept asking each other's moms if they had signed alehando as yo did to she kept saying no i did not you were there yet sol an yet he was just scared wok he would sleep with me this kid he could not even go to the play room to play because he was scared that ice was conrab him and take him and sometimes i tell him son go grab a go craps om hill and he said no mam the officers are there and they could take yo and he would sometimes even a scream in his sleep and i'd ask him what is rong and he would sad mam i am scared do not sleep he tell me e has sensiner ging to take me o eld marmeists yer an abaane as ot bat for what it is worth as far as i can tell when per sentim of the option of letting their kid out are being stuck together intetention every single family chose to stay all the lawyers i talk to and they represent almost every single family in these facilities they told me they did not know of any one who agreed to separate better to be alone together at least this was a loneliness they knew bnadie raymon is one of the produces of vashim a the handr in his maman did finety get releasd seven weeks ago but it had nothing to do with the judges older a the hanrer had to have his appendexount and they could not care for him at the facility the judge has extended the dead line for ice to figure out what to do with kids who have been detained longer than twenty days ice hasn'ntil the end of the month we have arrived at act fool a plied bub studies canwe take a moment to review some of the negative connitations the wood isolation brings up think of the pendlty books ol solitry can finment but what of that isolation is a choice you make thos that aloneness feel something very different i spoke to some one with an idea of the answer to that question marsa sunday ellen the story begins in twenty seventeen sandy was living in brooklyn with an increasing feeling that they wontesoliv closi tonation it was not tht thy foolin out of love would cities this was less about running away than it was about actively running toold something something green and lush on on top of that sandy was beginning to come out as non binery i think i was am just starting to play with such things as dressing a little more endrogenously and leaving the house and or going to a a a barber shop for man and and getting a a haircut there and trying to kind of violate that taboo and not feel to weard if all these men were staring at me as i got a hair cut in those months of change they would begun to notise how their very apparants seemed to make the ad charged i had shifted from a peering a certain thing in public which was a white woman to appearing this other thing which was this white i do not know a are you a jed or what a im and i was i think all of the time becoming more and more aware of everybody who saw me and what id i look to them and how much of a threat was a randum woman in a woman's room going to be to me i'm was i going to get werd looks was i going to get yelld at was i going to get hostile comment mattered at me and i must sensitive flour i a very i i i i really i i i do not know i'm very i sensitive to people's feelings and emotions and i think there was a sense of it would probably be wiser for me to cut down on the volume of interactions that i have with strangers but sandy had at they thinkatives and example of how to handled the situation their uncle bob at some point heedles ha decided that the volume of intirections in his life was way to big and he took decisive raticolection he moved a few hours away from way he would grown up in the bayaria to some what father op nos the place mostly free above the humans sandy had known bob as a sort of waito igin he lived a mostly solitry existence sometimes they would see him a christmas or at the grandfather's vacation him in nowthen miniserto bob lack to have long conversations sometimes he would leave long rambling messages in sandy's families onsery machine playing his music of comedyscates growing up sandy did not see bob as the kindred spirits in a family that did not talk directly about things bob was an incomplyte paton and example of fala as a teanaja bob had been given the slyciatric dike neses of scidsifrenia and was repeatedly hospitalized and prescribed anto cycontic midication sometimes against his will in family lul he was kind of this troubled guy ho got kicked out of high school and then bounced between slice hospitals and friend's couches sandy and bob wont clos and then one day in two thousand a nine just as sandy had stalted gradschool in iowe they got a package in the mal bob had written his old abiography and sent it to them i initially got this taxt in the mal from my hermit uncle that was typed in all caps on a typewriter and sixty pages in a hat swear words and slurs and i was a mass and t was i was just what is this i do not confess and i at the time i would have thought o ha this guy my as i would have called him way back my crazy uncle bob my crazy uncle bob and me we are as far apart as two people can be i would have thought in my heart here i am i'm i am a scholastic a chiefer and here is uncle bob who lives in the desert and i've been to his house once and it was full of cigarette smoke and bipbles and atv that he had not turned off an decates and i cana got out of there and was all right i do not really need to know that guy but then sandy got to reading the manuscript and they did not just read it they dove into it tried to figure out who bobbols even stoughted writing a book about him and they discovered something bob had solved for himself a problem that his mental helth professionals and the world in general had not been able to bob had managed to figure out the best version of his life living alone far away from the crush of people andsandy found that bob was mostly contens and i saw that as a model for o hay you have realized your incompatible with society at large perhaps what you do i was all i kind of havela a guide book here they took bob's example and moved in twenty seventeen sandy and tabl friend now husbands teave up state to the cat'skills they wont undat any romantic illusions about country living s if i go to a grocery store or i go to the post office and old man would stare at me the whole time i grotry shobd or little kids would debate what gender i was in front of you known a mean that kind of stuff could happen here just as well as it could happen anywhere i'm and there is not really anywhere where i think i feel entirely safe other than my house whjust why i my house much tell me about you sets sup thin how how isolated is life up there really when when we moved here where i sit on my front porch i do not see another human dwelling it is very much my neighbours are trees and trees and trees and trees it is just it is astonishingly beautiful in a million ways every day i mean i think that that is mental health gar befor cived nineteen sandy's husband traveled a lultful look sometimes sandy was alone for weeks at a time it felt incredibly challenging at times especially aleon i was oh no i felt oh what id i just do i've replaced people with trees i had that feeling of oh no i'm going to have no friends and then i rememberd hob and i remembered wall bobed in let living in the desert stop him from having friends bob build a sytem for himself what he interrected with people but not many and not much that it became unwonted noise in his head it was only as alone as he needed to be it sounds out bub a man who proudly cold himself ahomet living only with his two dogs was actually something of a social savent i think in bob's specific case it totally surprised me i got on the phone with every person who had known him if i could possibly find who would talk to me and i'm everybody who i found everybody i spoke with was you will not believe it bob you tok all all the time bob woulds stay and touch and i was kind of is not that funny how enorm here seems to be if you are physically isolated you have to be really cut off from people and i think bob if anything because of the life he would led and all of the ways in which i think he was a a a lonely person he was actually i think really a dept at overcoming mayby that little voiceincs your head that says i do not reach out do not do that that would be weird or whatever bob was not worried about that he was calling people and think it is forced me in a way and i do not know not really accept physical isolation as an excuse for being disconnected i try to tall myself hay do not just stop talking to people because you live out here it is something that you have to investan sandy wanted to learn how to be len and how to do it comfortably an the was to just hang out with themself and bob provided a model his big three tenets wat creativity community and spirituality bob was this just example i had kind of in mye head if o ka you are alone what are you gin a do about it what to do bob showed you it is not the same stuff i do not read the bible and play the guitar and watch joll o steem and call my cousin jane i do not do the same stuff that bob did i do called jane but i i had to figure out what are my versions of read the bible play guetar the version of that was singing and playing the piano baking bread and whe pussible growing food and sharing it with a small community would you say that you you have ended up getting what you wanted would you did it make your life better in the ways that you hoped it would oh i mean honestly bem i do not even remember what the world was before i mean i i feel my whole consciousness began about three years ago when i move to the oh ah i do not isit tig thigs es oweard i do not remember this for me this is my whole universe now is this this place the weather here to day and what is going on in my garden i think i've just ya've hawd a full head transplant of some kind even since the first afternoon i was here i was just yes yes yes yes yes yes this is what i want to be doing sandy's notele do not really the same way boblasn't ite instead there inisols of self govened isolation which is different to the misery of cived nineteen driving lissinto ourinwhos indefinitely sandy's isolation is completely under the control they looked squaly at solugnes and made decisions about haw to manage it alone is one of those words that i immediately kind of onder are not we all alone is there anybody who does not feel very alone i would love to meet that persond there is stuff that can make that even more profound i think when your queer trans maybe to you just know that some people aren' oin to be in your life forever for me coming out has 'ntailed a fair amount of social loss as long as you are alive you aregoining to have to contend with being inside your head being inside your story being inside the world which is full of prejudice and bulshet you kow i think that for me that really thinking about not let us solve it all or how ill combat loneliness forever definitely i've had these moments for am wow i've really set myself up to just be alone i've tried to kind of give my self permission to embrace yah i'm weird i'm not normal i've never been normal there was never a moment of my life when i understood what whatever a person who who was a side woman at birth or may on of birth and just feels that way i do not know what that is i've never known what that is for me it is freeing to just bee ye i live in the country by myself for the most part and i i can walk around topless and i've had top surgery and i do not care if any ond drives by and sees my scars this is who i am and life is glorious and let us show up for it bob was not sitting in the desert going oh wo wits me i'm sure he had minutes and days where he felt that way i think he did sometimes get really down about some of the experiences that he had in his life especially the first time he was in a hospital i think of lotstuff happened to him that really was hard and i think he also was some one who de spite a lot nfigured out how to sit down at his typewriter or pick up his guitar and continue on sandy ellen the book about their uncle bulb is called a kind of miraculous paradise a

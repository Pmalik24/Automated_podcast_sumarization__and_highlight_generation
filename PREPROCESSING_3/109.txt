hunter bidon gets indited on gun charges and faces af decate in prison and he media question bhe the re publicans can now leave jo bidon alone jobidn unliashes magun nomics and mak in kelly grills donald trump i benshker o this is the menshgaro shot he benshcuresh responser by express a vipian privacy is a right not a privilege defend yourihts at express vepians ot com slash mun in what has to be one o the most obvious ploys of all time the do ja has now indicted hunter bidon on federal gun charges why do i say this is apploy while there ar bunch of reasons why i say this is aploy he is not going to jail for a significant period of time this prosecution is not over the actual charges that anyone carries about namely the tax charges and the foreign agent's registration a charge that iv not yet been brought the clock is ticking on those this is a distraction it was always a distraction the gun charge was basically away for them to smuggl in rgan at and the rest of all these in vestigations in the gun charge that does not mean he does not deserve the gun charge he clearly deserves the gun charge his notchus that he lied on gun form its that he lied on a gun form and then attained the gun ea shoul got the gun nthen he had the gun and the threwt in the garbage can as can be awkward for the biden administration because now hunterbidon and his lawyers are going to argue thate violates the secon amendment for him to be prosecuted under these terms meanwhile his datis out there saying that no as you have a gunrer sure covelarvos derin gagro s that' cano awkward for jobino but is this a key issue interms of hunter and jo of course not we coronally have an impeachment inquiry going on that is entirely predicated upon the corrupt relationship between hunter bidon and jobidon and jobidon's response to this and his deoja's response to this presumably is we will prosecute hunter bidon on some ancillary charge t'll get off with a relative slap on the rest and then you got you alljest go abat your business there is nothing else to see hir that is that is the ploy according to enbisy news federal proscures have indicted hunter bidin the sun of president biden on gun charges quirtdocuments scho bidon was indited thirsday in federal court in delaware on three counts tie to possession of a gunwell using an arcotics two counts accuse biden of having completed a form indicating he was not using e legal drugs when he bought a colt cober revolver on october to thousinatin the third count alleges he possessd a firearm while using an arcotic inditment has the bidan certified on a federally manded in form quote he was not in unlawful user of and addicted to any stimulant arcotic rug and any other controlled substance when in facts as he knew that stavement was false and fictitious two of the countsecarry maximum prison sentences of ten years a third has maximum sentence of five years each count also carries maximum fine of two hundred an fifty thousand dollars given the fact that hunter bidon has not spent the day in jail yet and heis never played guilty to a crime far as i'm aware this means he is probably again not going to go to jail for any significant period of time that cases being overseen by special council david wice but is he any mac carthy points out this again is canova scam prosecution a why well there few reasons one this particular case is happening in delawares any mc carth he points out well as your recall the entire scandal revolving around david wites is that he was not granted acc ass to prosecutes hunter bidon in any jurisdiction outside of delwar he always had the jurisdiction to prosecute hunter bidon inside of delaware what took him long the answer is who ise trying to cut a sweetheart eal with hunter bidon the a jobidon and this also does not acually robutt any of the charges that david wises was denied the ability to proscute hunter bidon outside of delawar becus again heis cronly prosecuting him inside of delaware as h animc carthy wrights thereare no bidon appoint hou o us a turneys to blame for wise's failure for five years to file the indictment those finally returned on thursday the stature limitations was on the precipice of expiring it was wises and whises alone who delayed bringing oneof the most straight ford fellowny gun cases you will ever seed wices was not being blocked he was stalling and also is animc carthy points out given the fact that t bidin justice department tried to dissuppure the case against hunter biing just a couple of months ago with that diversion plan his defendes hunter biden's offencecan be really really easy they are just going to point to the prosecutors in say guys they did not take it seriously they wre willing to sign the deal with us five seconds ago it is only because that deal fellow part in public view that they ran away from it but the obviously do not consider us a particularly serious crime as he animc carthy says it is rich for the same justice departments put out o statement in connection with to days indictement stressing that hunter is facing up to twenty five years imprisonment if bin is convicted on any or any or all of the three fellonies his defencelayers are gingto hae a really strong argument tose us neen to recount of the proscutors set and did in the first place and then his animc carthy points out quite correctly the only case wheites is brought is the one that hunts or bidon is involved in but joe is not he did not bring the tax case yet now remember the clock is ticking there is a six year statute of limitation on possible tax crimes those charges have not yet been brought the latest possible tax crimes that we know about for hunter bidon there were in some of the charging documents in the proposed plead deal arrangement the latest charging documents carried crimes up to two thousin eighteen two thousand nineteen it is currently two thousan and twenty three it' assume that the last crimes that they are going to a ledge are in two thousand eighteen that means they have in ti the beginning of next year to charge him on the tax crimes the middle of the campaign election what what what is that mean well means the statute of limitations could easily run while they are trying to distract over cere werh the shiny gun gunn indipemen object now one cares about this anothewrds should thy indent him of corse thi shoul indide him it was crime should he go to jail i mean under his own fathers interpretation of the law he should certainly go to jail dhoes this make any difference at all to the real underlying issueds surrounding hunter bidon of course not they are charging him on the ancelary crime to distract from the fact that hei're nt charging him on the key crimes namely violish in the foreign ations registration act which might immediately link up with jobidon and influence peddling or on the tax avoiden stuff which again might immediately link up to his father jobidon hunter biden's lawyer for his part is claiming that really the only reason this is happening is bcause a partnessin interference which is weared the reason this really happening is because you gos tried to create a sweethart deal and a judge exposed the sweethart deal and then the go go j was em barris in renagd on the sweethart deal be brandi statement from hunter bidens atturney abby lawl that has just comban it says im park quote as expected prosecutors fil charges to day that they deemd wer not warranted six weeks ago following a five year investigation to this case the evidence in this matter has not changed in the last six weeks but the law has an has maga republicans improper and partisan interference in this process he says k abby law also continued by telling eran burnat quote the law says whether or not the person is possessing the gun while they are eddicted there is ambiguity in the statue which we will have to pursue if the case continues at the time you purchase the gun i vronthing tois evidence that that is what he was suffering when you refered to his book head just come out of reabilitations there can ot present whatever defence is they are going t present but really again what is this about this about the d o j getting this charge off the table said they can then claim that they have done enough here and then they can wash their hands of the entire thing this is the direction in which theyare moving pretty obviously and you can see the media are calling for willget to that momentarily first let us talk about the american meat am american met it is the best et why why e you get meat from anywhere lse america makes the best meat and not only doesamerica make the best meat we know t company in america that makes the bst meate that would be good ranchers you care about what your family eats does good ranchers tat's why they spent years building relationships of local farms to source the best one hundred percent american beef chicken pork and

god ranchers american meat delivered o cas what is all thits really about what all this is really about is providing the impetess for the media and for democrasts saylison has not hunter suffered enough has not his loving father suffered enough why did you leave hunter a lote you can hear this is the tenor that the media ar are now taken see an ends breonaceelishus is anyone else you an charge this way hunter is actually a victim is not he he is kind of a victim when you think about it no that hundred bythans the terniys ate an a point tothout ruling in the fifth circa itha calls him to question whether this law is een going to stand ill ren by the time o this is all set an done and sertain efor get thi spree cort why then aven pureto it i mean if this was another defendin would they be pursuing it iv no the question ofe thinking you were to here o lod from hun ter bidin tam and thorten for people who support him yet wo why why even pursuing it why why ye i'm sure they be asking the exact sam questions if one of dho trom children had been charged whele who is president of the united states or or maybe maybe hey'd actually just be cheering that i should break out the pomhums an sureleader out that is nall the rest reporters we are going after james comer comer of course has been leading the investigation into hunter bidins crupt business relationships with dad and repors is not this enough why cannot you leave the poor druggad dicted prostitute using diralick alone you are still expressing the skepticism here i mean the ided that youiner you you wanted an indictment from your prospective your that is not enoug an in di but fur o money londing we lation of the forn ago tregoutracion at tacivation the lis goes one on a you have never heard me s anything about gon charges at again that is the one crimehe is committed that you cannot ta the jo but correct that is jims comer from kentucky of course this is right andtiis also by the media they leagus one wiped the slakelin and that is all they want they loved o the sweetheart deal it was their favorite it is what democrats want as well but here is the reality the im peachment inquiries not going away because it is perfectly ovies as i said yesterdon the show when you hear people shouting there is no evidencs there totally rit thre's no evidence that joe was involved in hunter's business in his business transiactions in his business life except for evidence from two of hunder bidins business partners statemens by hunter bdn himself tacs from hunter bitons what is aps from hunter bitin actual bank accounts moving money into shell companies yat's ip for all that there is no evidencs what isowever tot totally clean is the rivene now jims comer meanwhile he is pledging that the inthicent peachmen inquiry they will get into personal bidin bank accounts thay themselves hae fil suspicious of cabs and i dont honer are they helpin you are they obstructing you at sacts on ma lik bank be happi o on burden themselves and shat this stup to you the banks af been bury helpful with the shell cupis that we are getting to the personal bidin bankof caw and we suspect that the lawers obardy warn the banks aget hanting attything over death a but we are getting in the banks and other chance and will see represent im nancy mayes hov south carolina she is similarly saying that they will sipen a hunter while investigating joe which is which is right do they explain why they did not siscipen ang hunter biton well i believe that will happen but we have got to get the bank records fors i may ates the chicken before the ag we have to know honder bin as i can to tell the truth and er under o an we want to make sure that we have all of the financial statements and records in accordance with the transaction as at elegealy happened and isto that way we know if he is telling the truth and yofve got to have that there is got to be some dew diligence we have got to be deleberate we have goto be actual we have to tell the truth and meanwhile if you ever wonder hw donald trom hand happened how he happened the reason is mit rominy an that is the reason tha doen from happen for a wide variety of reasons reason mber one is the te media the left attacked mit romney who is most milktost politician of our eura with extraordinary alacrity and everybody n the republican pirys alk an woldn't give you a giant orangemental thinger now you did not the superpolike guy who refuse to say a bad word about anybody youn't that guiye he was too much for you bitl have out this hes that is reason number one but reason number to is because mit romney is a guy who is spent a lot of his political career providing cover for democrats and the reaction for lot republicans we do not want people ladmit romney at the top of the party and i see it i do i get it i mean first whal i think the entire republican party broad rit has rejected that sort of direction even the other people whare up for the republican presidential nomination wor running right now are not admit romneylan there is not muc to amit romneylane the republican party any more nor should there be admit romney yesterday again his sole job appears to be to to gain strange new respect from the left at this point and again i think he is a good person by do not understand why he thinks that the mark of a good person is to gain respect from the se an ends in the amesan b sces yesterday romney was asked about the impeachment inquiry into jobidon ans a now now i thi you wonder why that why the democratic party has tremendous loyalty among its base and there there is not a lot of breakways in the democratic party the reason is takes the democratic party's an excellent vehicle for progressivism when when i comes down to jo bidon and burniystanders are not separated by much other than affect jovides policies look a lot burney senders the ratical left looks at joe andt e oka yags old ya's de crepid ya's corrupithe is doing the things we want to do meanwhile the republican base looks at the republican party and we we ask you to do acts and just will not do it here it heare's mit romney saying thathe is not hearing a high crime in misdemeaner when it comes to hunter and jobidon i know the house is beginni an peacmen inquiry a i have not heard anyaligation of something the wuld rise to the leve of a high probof is to be i think it be very unusual to actually see a ri furl of it b i i do not expect that to happen get that that is an amazing statement given the fact that he voted for i trumpson peachmen on both accounts right ofm the on the first one the grain one which is insane give you crimlin ton mean alege a crime and he said that that donal trom deserve to be in peach for high crimes and mis demeaners while by the way defending the business relationships you hunter and joe there is mit romney just a couple of years ago the grave question the constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act extreme and eggregus that it rises to the level of a high crime and mister meader yes he did the president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival the presidnt with held fital military funs from that government to present to do the president delayed funs for an american ally at war with russian invaders the president's purpose was personal and political accordingly the pr as in this kil to of an appalling of use a pubic trust a by the way in that exact same speech he actually defended hunter and jo i'm not getting i means soso you ron by the republican party turned to trump it is because of mit rhumny that is part of the issue here what he actually said in tht speech is quote with regard to hunter biden taking accessive advantage of its father's name's unsavery but elso not a crime give then neither case of the father nor the son was any evidencs presented by the presidents council that a crime been committed the president's insistence that they be in vestigated by the cranins is hard to explain other than is a political pursuit there is no question in my mind tht were ther names not by in the president never wouldhave done what he did again that the fact that the ment romny spent his days defending the bidons while attacking trump and is still doing that is kind of an insane referendum ona the old school republican party again just one second weu'll get to jobidons a tempt to avoid a a rather bad presidential electoral fate by relying on his economic plans good luck wuld tat first the

and running agains sotle trump he is hoping that it will carry him to victory again he certainly cannot rely on his economic program because economic programm is a full scale disaster area according to the your times president byin challenge his republican opponents on thursday in their areaf political strength argan he has done a better job of managing the economy than former president donald trumpted and accusing his predecessor's congressional allies of under cutting working class americans ah yout good luck with that again americans do not agree with that by every available pole thiy thing the trumpted better job on the economy than bidened by leaps and bounds bidon is now relying on old stand by talking points the jest do not work sa here is jobidon explaining it is republicans will not tir what ther for the usoideric wok half of what your for is what you are agains we should point out if if you say i wish to take this car and drive it over a cliff and i say you should not do that i're enough to offer what i'm for whard i'm fors you not driving the car over the cliff here is jobidon trying to say words from his mouth hole and in failing were ika has the strongest

circular firing squad is the proper way to fight the demi crats which is they are everyone is good at this then that is the amazing thing when t whenever folks tell you that they watch a show house of cards you should just know politics is not house of cards no one knows what they are doing they are all idiots ther're munch of moreons who run into walls at top speed and then yell about how much it hurts and however one has victimized them and then they turn around and run into other walls at top speed ad they do all this whell spendingyour money this is how politics works typically speaking it is the best system except fur it it is the worst system except for all the others but i it is what we have naturally republicans have decided they are going to run top speed into walls over a possible government shut down no i do not know exactly whte of the deliverables here ive set before give me a list of deliverables that you are seeking forn cevenmic carthy an maybe can deliver them maybe he can but there is one thing that i have noticed and that is that the democrasts control the senate in the presidency it isus the thing i noticed seen get some small concessions from them but the notion the'reging to radically remake american government ecause the power of the purse is with the house yes the power of the persons with the house and guess what happens if you lead to a large scale government shut down you pobably lose the house re publicans wildly under performed in last electoral cycle they hve a majority slim is ared the're going into an election cychl that is going to be at best very close for re publicans and this is a time that yofre gnto pick a fight inside you are party the reality is they are republicans should make hay when the sunshines the sun is not quite shinig right now tyou make of it what you can bheninstead therecan have circular firing squad time u'm matgates is attacking cevemc carthy for for no reason that i can what is the principled reason from matgates ere thega what is is deliverablet he gives me toeliverable i'm perfectly happy go along with the liverable chip roy during the last speakership fight give me as list of deliverals and iofs very much in favor of lot of those deliverables en' that is fine and then he got most of em and then he made a del mc carthyan tht's good but e'm s wondering what is the point of this matgates treated out sounds speak of mc carthy's having a total mormal one not rattled at all truth it is heaven controls is own fate instead of emotionally cursing let us do this single subject spending bills turm limits vote balance budged vote release gjanuary six tapes to all sepino hunter we must begin to mee eatly pull your self together cavenac ce few of those are teliverable hundred is going to get sopenan that is going to happen releasing the january six tapes to all fine he can do that that is fine a ballanst but youd vote is gin to go down to flaming defeat and a bunch of republicans rgn avot against it one of thethings that you do not do when your speaker of the house is bring up a vote that your own party is not kon to vote for that is a' typical thing you do not do just do not bring in to a vote mmc comes to terml of its same sort of deal and hen it comes to single subject spending bills listn'n i would love that i would love to run it that way also you noit is gon to happen none of that is tus can pass if the idea is all of this or government shut down the reality is going to be government shut down that is just what its gon to be i hate own of a facages i think their garbage i also do not believe the democrats are simply going to cave to republicans because macgates goes on emas and beseiniells about have mc carthy he is challenging mc carthy's speakership again hes suggesting that he is going to u to challenge mc carthy's speakership again apparently in a behind clothes dors meeting mc carthy was defin with his caucus and a he said youn't move the motion then move that fing motion to remove thim from his position if you think that you can do it and he happens o be right about that again the're a hundred igty hundred ninedy republicans inside the republican caukas were not kin avote for anyone else apparently he said if you think you scare me because you wan to file e motion to vacate move the effing motion and then he said if you end up replacing me my successor will make the same exact arguments i an and then gates reportedly responded by saying just move the effing spending bills but again he can move the spending bills and they could go nowhere what what is the fight even a bou that is the part i do not understand what is the big victory here what is the victory you are seeking to achieve here mc carthy for his part he saying no one winds in a goerment shut ton n understand something mc carthy won the last government shut down he did he wanted against bidon why cas bide made a massive tactical blunder he open by saying i will not negotiate over government shut down is that it will not negotiate over spending at all and then mc carthyis a cay i'm perfectly willing to negotiate all i want is these few things is that' one reasonable in fact i pass to bill mc a big obnibus bill because you virtually everythng you want why will not you negotiate and a wrong footed biden bidon has not made that mistake again now bidon's cases i'm happy to negotiate let us talk about it we have to do whatever we can to avoy to government shut down if mc carthy now takes the stand i'm going to shut down the government then all of the benefit of the goverment shut down a cruise to e democrats that isimple calculater there is something that that i object to in sort of my industry af the lot of people in my industry who are who believe it that idealism requires you to charge headlong into hard objects idealism is understanding what we would realism is under standing what you can get an idealist wo is not a realist is a fool if you are not if you are an idealist and what you think is theyou always go for broke always and for ever and that anything short of that is idealogical treason that is in correct it is not true that is not how business gets done its not how politics cats done is not how anything gets done in fact in fact it is a recipe for losing repeatedly because when you go for a hundred and yo will not to get any less than a hundred you are much likelier to get zero than you are to get eight if you tran get most of what you wants well then you etter know the way the land ou bttere actually take into account tactics and strategy and there is this defeatism that has come into the republican party that' o just no matter what we do whe're not can get watwe want mays whell just yell as loud as we can with no actual end goll here that is doable and then everyone who refuses to do that which is can yell them out of the party or gana when they alien a't them or gin to put up candidate to are bound to lose because if we yell ot may we will feel better defeatism is a sin the feat ism is a sin to spare s a sin is not stuff theyse shuld be doing and somebody who watchers pousac and people in my industry tion be doing either it is my job to tell you yes what my principles are but also the realistic lay of the landso we know what we can get and and i think thete a lot people in my industry who do not tell you the wlay the land and tey give a false perception of what it is that you can get and that is a mistake because it sets up unrealistic expectation s it means that there are politicianswho are negotciating who are trying to make the sausage and thn we object to the sausage making process then the sausage dusnt get made than really mad the sausage did not get made we blame them av ut the reality is that it is an ugly process it will always be anugly process if you want republicans to make serious changes in the spending habits of the united states which is what i would whut i would is th stuff that no one will talk about i will not restructuring the tettlements the vast drivers of our natuonal that are not marginal programms but it is not marginal cutting around the edges of what the defence budget the vast cuts that we need in our programms are going to be had by restructuring major programms yes medicar and social security those third rails of american politics democrats and republicans know and there we will come up on whe austerity has to be brought upon theamerican people that will inclue tax increases it will include massive cut's to social benefits all those things will happen is just ta question of wen or yeu can plan for it now but nobody will touch that instead will jab ere about pork barrel spending and bridges to nowhere that cost a fraction of what it would cost to you actually look it social security medicare and realities we are not can do any of that unles you actually win af t win you have to own the guife to own the house if to own the sind if to own the presidency then you can move stuff what is amazing to me is that the the calls for political courage constantly seem to be directly and in inverse proportions the amount of power re publicans wheeld its tenmen amazing think truly when re publicans control the house the senate and the presidency the calls for political courage disappear on the right when trump wass president and republicans round the house in the senate where are the calls for uts now's te moment guies let us restructiur social securito its restructiur medicate wut's change how we do spending bills now's the time lhet's do it right now let us it is do it right now where are the calls they totally one way non't care and then when the republicans are a barrely an control of one house of congs be strong you will have to stands up and nows the now is no actually you known you get thing's done when you have control of the levers wnow what is thats what is that be speak it bespeaks that when you'r victorious you tend to be lazy and when you 're not victorious you tend to be defeatest and thus desperate and thus chargein to walls at topspeed here is mac carthy talking aback on nobody wins in a government shut down which i mean speaking in terms of of just political winds and and losses weve got several of these no we's been a big winner from a overnment shut down in the recent in the recent past te sho trustration here cus tha trustru ires fustre wit som people in the comoy come back war oc o toly weg get this go nobody winds in ta government shut g that that happens to be truen you can you can yell about it you canou can protest about it a government shut down is not going to result in brokoboma re pealing abomicary wasn' going to whend had cruis did this routine back in twenty thirteen a a government sht down is not on result in jobidon renagging on the inflation roduction act or whatever garbage shuon topast as i can o do it again i'll giveyou the idealism i'll tll yo what

a bad strategy we got a talk about these twenty twenty four present ent ra election donal trump has a very decent thout of beng president of the united states if in fact he is the nominye when i say very decent out men fifty per cent i mean sixty per cent or seventy per cent i' mean a thirty three thirty fi per cen shot the reason tat i say that is because again he lost thelast election cycle and he lost in a bunch of states he shouldn' have lost including arizona and georgia and i do not know how he is coan make up the ground in places arizona and georgia given his turn campaign status the fact tha he spending all of his campaign money on for example legal expenses and the fact that e's can a face down four separate criminal inditemens in the next year an but that does not mean he camp possibly be president there is only one thing that could certainly four clothes trump from being president one hundred per cent he will not be president there is only one thing that could happen that would do that and that his he is own alligation that the the election is rigged ga've said this before one stonald trump says the twenty twenty election is rigged ye's now created in unfalsifiable reality because how can he ever win serious question how can he ever win if i tell you i played really hard last night my bascapollgamble let me tell you the refery was actively paid by the other side actively paid nevery tome i touch the bolliyc call the fowl did not matter what was happening on the qort there is no way for me to win ay say what guies next game same reff same nother ten can you win the answer is now he is been paid off the only way ironically for trump to be able to claim that he can win in the twenty twenty four election is one of two things if he says that i's rigged one yes to stop saying that it is rigged yes to say was it if we get enough voters out there we will win because i's not rigged because yet i lost in twenty twenty set din't get enough votes but i'm an a win next time he is come to get more votes a is not riggs who should vote because we ashly know that when when he says for example that things are rigged you should vote you knot the alcomas twenty twenty one georgia election two democrat senators and seven trollion dollars and spending thinks to donald trumps dommaass a tempts to turn the georgia twenty twenty one special elections in to a referenda on how he did in georgia leading a bunch of rule republicans not to vote and hand two separate sentenceeds to democrats and control of the senant and seven trolling dollars in spending yo kno it strategy i would to not do that strategy again donal trump can win yes to stop saying that the election is rigged the reason as tos topsaing the election is rig is why would you vote if the election is rigged why would i vote if the election is rigged no matter what i do they are going to rig the election cay the other thing tht h coud say the oretically is something has changed stemically between twenty twenty and twenty twenty four right he could say well they are bunch of re publican states that have cleaned up their act which sure i mean georgia pastobill florta passtogoloki he could theoreticaly make thate casele those can have a togher tim an arizona he he could he cold make the case that we are taking serious on the ground steps to engage in some the things democrats do ballad harvesting or early voting h could say those things right that would change the factors on the ground does he say any of those things he does not say any of those things yesterday he did not interview whit again it it is youritting to me donal trump could still be president he would still be president to day if he had run a good campaign in twenty twenty and by the way you would be leading jobidon by leaps and bounds if after the election of twenty twenty he had said o k i lost but your bins can be a terrible president and i'll be back in a year telling you how terrible it was and youre n' want me again you' been that simple or not doing that in any case donall trump does not interview with magin kelly and she asks him the question that i have been asking for a couple of years at this point if you say the twentye twenty election was rigged how did you plan on winning the twenty twenty four election if it is similarly rigge and his answer is every thing that i said he should not say his answer is it is riged thereis no way i can win they will just rigg it theyll bring hin fage voters the'l bring in fage ballats they will throw out good ballats and what is his strategy he says whell we will get great voter torn out that does not matter if you are entire argument is that stollan is in the back room throwing out the vote you get a bagilion votes you no win by a hundred million votes and you will still lose be cause your argument is as we would ave saiden loscal an argumen that proves too much in fact you are discouraging your own voters from voting when you say their votes do not matter this just strategic it is strategic foolishness i do not understand it i if he is ta ominam in o vote for him i want him to win if he is thenominy but doest not the strategy for winning this not the vote the straga for getting voter turn out up it is a strategy tfor cretting to spare inside your own party i do not understand this here he was of maging elly yesterday every one knows he think twenty twenty was rigged how are you going to unrig it gein twenty twenty four i get that question to lok they use coben dechee they cheat anyway because how can you win elections open vorders hi taxis hi intestrits no voterity a everything thiy dois april foles thay'd se opposite ke they have horrible policy they are only good to cheating an elections you want another to that i get the question towe have unbelievable people and wone ging to be fighting hi because if ina win the election i can he wonsit there is a secon we have unbelievable people in are gingto be and were goin i'n orn gin be fighting hell is not in answer to they cheated and rigged all the rules how are you going to win in twenty twenty i assume he would have said the same thing that yeead unbelievable people an ther going to fight hell fighting hell is not a strategy fighting hellisa description of a thing itis not a strategy if i tell you again the refere in this basket ball is paid in this basswall game is paid off by the opposition and his going to rig the game for the opposition and you say how re gan win and i samin o play unbelievable that does not answer the question it does not answer in the question must be answer because if you want him to win he better have an answer this question otherwise they will just do the same thing thy didn' twenty wenty according to him not accordng to me according to him again my caseis pretty simple heu wanty twenty sixteen heo lost in twenty twenty he can win in twenty twenty four be cause you want an twenty sixteen he culd also loose he lost in twenty twenty right which means he should run o election campaign and and he will win but he hs four closed that possibility now and now it is a box it is a box of his own making and the only person o benefits from that box is nonal trump the brand but not donall rump the presidential candidate do trump the brand benefits because if he loses he can claim that he was not actually a loser is somebody else's fault an they rid the rules i brews mean to him and all the rest ofthis wining nonsense or an by the way when i say nonsense it amea is not true i se e the wining in politics if you are wining or losing ay that is just the reality winer's wine and winner's win if he actually wants to win he should stop with the wining and he should start actually i do not know investing tens millions o allars and pallat harvisting operationse he should start investing tens millions dollars and get out toe vote efforts with regard to early ballating he should spend tends it send of his own money he should be spending this money on his legal fees that when i give a dollar to his campaign in the general which i'm try well then that money will not go to his legal f fes will go to actually doing the things necessary to win votes but hidn't stop there he keeds stoubling down on it according to down from the election is h't just read it is super ring which does not answered the question because if i do not win the election meaning this philosophy this thought but if i dof win the election i think our country is finished i think it is the most important election we have ever had if i do not win this election yeu talk o to me about all the different prosecution thes ern prosecutions he is earnen of these a biten inditments is indifferent this is in god coming down from hih and an diting youfos this is crooked joe bynes crooked is e three dollar bill used to say to it ollar bill but we have a few of them an how does n't santio otonst how he is in won consonderation and he said in dit my political uponent when they sayin ta ina sivery otesty the press first they saw that way but there with time they sor he is under i never now thes are all bitin inditments including the dais office he put his stop guy in the detys office and an that and everybody says it is not even o canan in it should even be brought you have see that you have heard that you prom ives tat nat o cates a ridiculous it is a ridiculous but they put he put his top people in the day he is dealing with fanny was in at lana it is all hoks mo but but heas the ga ut he has that is very important for people ta on oligans are buned out they thinking i'm not in gen ovot forget it my votes not cin exiously opposit there i do not they are getin ran it nie i down in bownest again they get avotin numbers that you have never seen before because they see what is happening should they do the malan should the jeo pe voters to the ballin o ca here is what we cannot allow yei would i would say let him do it by the way you knowm less on that id the toes day stuff but then you see what happen to carry lake we are all the machines were broken or big portion of en if be smarter to banks some vote before it ar you i ra i hurry lakin ou o hestot plocip for a second pos for sang carry lake is runng again in this for now for the senit narison a claiming that she wonc she did not wing she last way wet dish towel and e what drives down the vote it t it actively drives down voting to i don shol wen they vote relation the vot earlhy i nectiol te malat it yo of course they should beil it in are you are you kidting me aru kidting me o there is w one state in which there was a red wave ind twenty twenty two you knw which state that was it is the state i livin why caus every whote i know voted early every one because they learned the lesson of twenty twenty you vote early you vote however he got of hot you make sure you get the votes it why is he a bibilent about this he is the candid i do not understand what are you eglent a oblem tis they throw the votes out i'm it is trooked we have a vegle wavins o be clear what is the message o t voge do you want them to do the an the manlin voter no everybody people say yes do it i we have a bigge u i believe they send in fak ballatoky that is the bigger pthat is you third problem that is your ther pom they send in fake ballats they throw out the ballats that you are sending they broke all the machines no matter what happens i'm gon to lose also vote for me how is that possibly your campaign message on hiringan a win how what is that leads to it leads to ocaye this kan of protest mentality ok if i yellow loud enough than magic happins that is not how this works if you want trump to win he neds have an answer to this question in actual on the ground answer that involve spending money in particular ways and to plying resources in particular ways and if he is not focust on any of those things you have to ask the question is to why he is not focust on those things i i doft know the answer is it because it takes to much effort is it ecause hit is not care why if the only thing he cares bottes defeding bidon do the things you need tou do to defeat jobidon that does not involve complaining that they are literally going to take all the ballats and throw them out the window ause if that is true it do not matter what trump does you can a loose according to him not according to me wel tha was not the end of donald trump's intrview with maging cally magin gave the first interview of trump i've seen in a very long time that actually was a good interview with trump cause magin is the best in the business was not sic ophantic nonsense about how he is nike stomace pence and it was not the the left simply ask him why such a bad mean man who was her asking actual incisive questions and i got a say trump under performed he did i mean hits just the reality of the situation in this interview of magin cally n if i if therewere any one who are still objective in this race i do not know that they would be in love the trump's answer for example she asked him about his per formance on covid his performance on cord was at bast eight in extremely mixed bag every one who was there and who hasn' memory longer tan a goldfish knows that i remember it you remember it he is ripping on bryin camp in one moment say ha why is he reopening is state in the other he was liberate mich agan and is i i do not understand what you want on the one hand it was doctor fache would the greates thigt is at on the other hand it was doctor vauche he is thare it was just all confused an dis combobulated that is best case inarea in any case she asks trum a question that a lot of people have asked trump which is whyd in firefouching not lasn't i should think there is a reason he wouldnt firefouching his big mistake was putting fouchy in charge in the first place once he put fouchy in charge it happens to be the political case and de fense iv trump that fouchet being fired would hae created this massive fire storm in which weave been the siens versis trump and tht woulve been bad going into the elections i get it i ashlly do get that but now trumps hin a folket once once the we would moved you will further awong why was he giving fauche a presidential metal of commendation wy det that is at tht's a real qu stion that presidential metal of commedation came long after all this here ere is trump with making celly trying to explain is this the criticism of you that you made hin the face of the white house coronof iris you think sos and he was added every pressor that he was running hurd for the administration on covit and that you actually in the presidential commendation before he left office would not you a do over on that i do not know who gave him the commendation i really do not know who gave him the commendation as a noaation en wan o mark somebody foutably candid in e commendation he probably but limig us tay about fouchy fouchhe was very important in the byan administration much less important if he did not want o stup john he wanted to let everyone come in from john i stopped it i overwrode it i overrode many of the things he did he was much less important to me now without all being said he is been there for years he was respected hed lost a lot of the respect because of covit but he was respected and on covit if what i did i let the governors run this dace ya that was the best parter that he did not vag lat governors runng he is right about that but he gave a president yes of course he gave a presidential commendation to on the dgay before he left office wo kat as by january he would already lost the election who is leaving office and he gave a presidential commedation to by the way not just not just anthony vauchy he gave one to the much maline to general mark milly he gave one to deborag burks if you recall this is literally in the same list he went to debera burks he gave one to mark milly and he ae ones we anthony fauchy but he is not now who did it bi men since your signatureas on the page i assume youre the one who did it then of course he suggestd that to santus was a big fouch he found which wilt come on this he just that is you can love trumpyin butfer tram all that is finin danty and we stop pretending that he is being an honest advocate here he is not that is a lie it is a lie the that donald trump was some how a less or fan of anthony fauchy than ron te santist that is absurd he said that in the celly enterviews ridiculous this hance has fought back on that of course as he shrould i'm sure you saw the former president's interview with making kelly last night i trying to relitigate a lot of these covet issues and and controversies from the end of his presidency am you were you were accused of having one of the worst lockdowns in the country vacin mandates im praising fouchy for months on and i want to give you a chance to respond to all atout because that all that stuff was mentioned by the former president at at interview well personly is importan to say that that is der fron from whe i tro used to say i mean he used to crace florida for having been open he used to say i was one the country's great governors i said we her ol covy correctly and brilliant ly he used to say that he was on recor always say that i now we as o a tracti and that when he is now changing his ton that that obviously is true that wasnit the end of the celly nterview g enowit is a really goon interview by maginsion really good job but this shask trump about his classified document's case and by the way magan is a believer that trump should not be prosecuted on the classifid documents case far as i'm aware specifically beclass hillery clinton was not prosecuted for prety much the same thing but you ask him a petty simple clestion which is why did you keep the documents and then why were you waving them around and also why did you liht o ret barran say that the documents youere waving around on tape saying that they were classified and you could have declassified to them but you did not why did you say that those were golf plans hn they clearly were not and at this point trumps lawyers mush as be setting their hair on fire i mean my goodness he is just again guys if you'nt do criming do not to te criming on tape and then do not retrospectively admit that you did the criming thi here is nonal trump making his lawyers i iting his lawyers i'll have just brain anurism ot this point ow why would you describe a newspaper article as highly confidential and still a san sesine si askified it te meginhow you shant at lumigistis numbe one i did nothing because i come under the presidential records the facious who are going after me and than not going after by even though he has about ten times more documents may be more than that he has document's gon back forty years or fifty years we did nothing wrong i come onto the presidential records act i'm allowed to have these documents this was done in nineteen seventy eight and this was done for exactly this reason i'm allowed to have these documents i'm but in other words he lighta rebarrins to their golflants and are not newspapers they were classified documents but e's makin the argument he is a lasd to have the clssified documents i mean now he is basically just setlic what he is talking about is a legal interpretation of the statue it by for the record the presidential records act covers personal presidential communications its if you keep a diary of your time in the white house that does not become classifid material that is yours it does not mean thatifthere is a see i report the crosses your desk and you do not declassify it and you take it home and y but it your drawer that it is now magrically to classified that is not wit the presidential records aceds in never said thact is that is a misstatemen of the law but even if you interpret the law trump is interpreting the law that is a legal argument that is not a factual argument what trump isgin to be acts to testify about if he testifies inthat cases he says that he will in his lowyer certainly will not let him if he if he were to tustifing that case they'r not goin to ask him about his interpretation of the presidential records act that is an argument for legal antalists theyre gon to ask him whether he declassified the documents whether you wen throug any prosses and he is going to say no because he did not go throug any process he is goin to say there automatically to classfi that again that is legal argument not a factual one hey're not say did you go through any prosses foree classifyingthe documents can say no then tey gu to say ontape did you say that you could have declassified the documents but you did not and he did not have to say yesk o they have montape han hen theyre going to say were those documents the aron plans were they something that was classified and he is going to have to say well yes that cause he is saying all of it right on magin kellys show again should tat prosecution we broughtagains from no is trump his worst his own worse enemy when it comes to these legal matters absolutely finally magan did ask trump about his stands on transgenerasm which has changed radically overtime he used to say that he would allow men to compete against women in this universe contest ye he said that he would famously in twenty sixteen allow catelan generar to use the women's rest room even though catelan i is a is a male and a and cure us his answer at it is amazing how uneasy he is to just say that a man canp become a woman it is kan a fascinating and now catelan is gruse i knew bruse and you a bruse was a great aftly and a very handsome person very hansome guy and all of tha sudden bruseis scatelan i said whats this all about this was a brandnew subject too is a brandiy subject jask him about whit he was aloud use the female rest rom then and he was well you kow nobody ws talkingabout t the time first wale not true but o k fine that is that is your case she ten ask him you can a woman be come man an he cannot hesitates own the question in a very weird way becaus here' a thing byu trump its very easy for him to simply say the things that would be they would be corract which is i changed my mind on this subjeck but trump has never admitted ever that he is ever made a mistake it is impossible for him at now is any this con a matter the answers no for lot re publican voters thet on'k and they are not looking at what he says that i even looking what he does they feel they know the guy and they are loyal to him and they believe that that because he wone in twenty sixteen he will pull a rabbit out of the hat in twenty twenty four andhe does not have to have a plan whe will matcic his way to the white house oki fine but in the world of actual political analysis wer we are supposed to look at what people say an what people do making coli did a good job of theinterviewing trump and he did not do job handling those questions just on any objective level iof gate time for some things i in than some things that i hate things that i to day i'm excited to announce to you that the union solidarity coalition which is apparently a group of a quasi famous actors and atresses and writers and such they are now auctioning off their services to benefit their cruis healf care fun now at this point i should remind you that every single person his auctioning off sertts is worth many millions of dollars and if they actually wanted to hew benefit their crustelf car fron they could tousiny track in fact thit would be the best way to do it if you are leana done him and number wone you come from a very wealthy family and number too you you have a net worth of ten twelve million dollars you non't's a great way to help out the people who aare members your crusinima track they amazing you gotn't get much money could do that if you are say bob oden kirk and a you made a massive success of yourself over the past few years and you have a net worth that range is in the sixteen million dollar range well maybe your sin a chack well no are they doing any ofthat no what they are actually doing is thei'r auctioning off their services guys this is exciting exciting sefs let me read you some of the auction itims that are now available because man this is this is what what jems are available to you these bids are open on e bay by the way for the next to seven to eight days i i cannot i cannot wait you could if you spend you proper amount to money have a mural painted i leana dunem in your house she will come to your house if you live in new york london er ali and she will paint you a mural in your home which sounds lick a nihtmare because i'm leana dunhem is u most famous for yont being obsessed with the genitalia she she says that when she was growing up her her house was effectively covered in pictures of female genital i i hope that you are a ready to enjoy that n then theire pictures of her doing murales in kid's rooms i'm anta and that there are some restrictions on the bid she says at this package does not include any items or services not details in th above description it is non trans ferbl and also respect for talenson their staff will be expected at all times inappropriate behavior or solicitation for personal gain by the winner could result in the immediate conclusion of the experience with no refun the town has the right time the experience at any time for any reason with no refun and a background chacanot and all the rest if you want leana dunhem a werdo in your house painting strange things on your walls you could do that by the way tht's only an a cost ou about three grand other items of interest you could get a a session asking maggiye gillanhall twenty minutes and twenty questions ithmaggie gillanhall thow one is going for about little under a thousand dollars right now twenty minutes and twenty questions with maggie gillanhal honestly if you are going to do that iu'd recommend they just ask her about jake the hle time you she just ask her how did you feel when hu'sed in princip persha when he is an october sky howdo that make you feel maggie now that is th i think that would be of benefit to to the world nat toshaly on a isa is allowing you to help her help you the new york times sunday cross for puzzle i do not know why im you would desire that or hou she is issue a mazing at crossword puzzles or why it would i oh kay i suppose thows there is one of these iv ben on and that is apparently john lithgow we will do a water colour portrait of your dog which is pretty hysterical and i'll admit that is eem kind of kind of un and kind of worth it apparently you can also bid on other items including for example twenty questions twenty minutes zume with sara silverman now the problem is that during that wum you will have to actually listen to sara silverman's voice for twenty long minutes yuou the the little tutze baby voice yo you will have to listen to that an she presumably say suerewords a lot thow that is that is exciting stuff from to emin jimmy kimell paid a lot of money just an not have to listen to sara silverman's voice there is that i'm apparntly adam scott ouknow the guive from severans he is offering to walk your dog for one hour ele base dogs only twenty five hundred dollars or at omscott could sign chack that would benefit the crew but he is done it he is gon to walk your dog for an hour which

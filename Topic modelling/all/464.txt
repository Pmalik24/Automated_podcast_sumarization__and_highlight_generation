HERE I'M GLAD TO BE HERIS AMAZING IVE A LONG TIME CONSUMER OF YOUR CONTENT I'VE LEARNED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT ABOUT FITNESS  BOTH IN THE WAIHT ROOM CARDIO MUTRICIAN THINGS THAT I'VE APPLIED FOR OVER A DECADE SO FOR ME THIS IS PARTICULARLY MEANING FULL AND MY GOLIER IS REALLY TO ASK A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS TO WHICH I'M INTERESTED IN THE ANSWERS BUT ALSO OF WHICH I KNOW THE AUDIENCE IS REALLY CURIOUS ABOUT SO ONE OF YOUR MONTRAS IS A YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO LOOK LIKE AN ATHLET TRAIN LIKE AN ATHLETE AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING REALLY SPESSIAL THAT SETS ASIDE WHAT YOU DO FROM WHAT A LOT OF OTHER UM VERY WELL QUALIFIED PEOPLE DO AND IN TERMS OF THE USE OF WAITS AND RESISTANCE WHETHER NOD'S BODY WAIGHT OR WAITS IN THE GIM OR POLES VERSEIS CARDIO YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF OVERALL HEALTH AESTHETICS AND AHLETICISM IS THERE A WAY THAT YOU COULD POINT TO YOU KNOW THE IDEA THAT MAYBE PEOPLE SHOULD BE DOING YOUR FIFTY PER CENT RESISTANCE TRAINING ON FIFTY PER CENT CARDIOW MAYBE IT SEVENTY THIRTY MAYBE IT'S THIRTY SEVENTY AND AND HERE ON TALKING ABOUT THE TYPICAL PERSON WHO WOULD LIKE TO MAINTAIN OR MAYBEVEN UM ADD SOME MUSCLE MASS NOABLY IN PARTICULAR AREAS FOR MOST PEOPLE AS BAS JUST OVERALL MASS AL THET WILL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER AND PEOPLE WANT TO MAINTAIN A RELATIVELY LOW BODY FAT PERCENTAGE AND BEIN GOOD CARDYO OF ASCULAR HEALTH WHAT'S THE SORT OF CONTOUR OF A BASIC PROGRAMME THAT ANYBODY COULD THINK ABOUT AS A STARTING PLACE O IIVAGS LEKE A SIXTY FORTY SPLIT WHICH WOULD BE LEANING TOARS A WAY TRAINING O STRENGTHEN IN IN THE AND THEN EITHER THE CONDITIONING ASPECT THE ABOVE FORTY PER CENT SO IF YOU LOOK AT OVER A COURSE OF A TRAINING WEK ANIN FIVE DAYS IN THE GIM WOULD BE A GREAT PASSING AVASING  IN THE GIM IT COULD E DONE AT HOME BUT THREE DAYS TRAIN TRAINING ON DY ENTS A FRIDAY CONDITIONING TO DAY THERES I YA TWO DAYS IT'S IT IT'S A PRETTY EASY ROUND ABOUT WAY TO SPLIT THAT UP OF COURSE DEPENDING UPON TRAINING GOALS AND AS YOU SAID THE ESTHETIC GOALS LIKE THOT WILL SHIFT DRAMATICALLY BUT IF YOU WANTED TO SEE THE BENEFITS OF BOTH THAT'S PROBABLY THE THE EFFECT OF DOSE FOR STRAIN TRAINING AND THE EFFECT OF THOSE FOR CONDITIONING AT THE BEARMENL LEVEL AGAIN BEING OF MUCH BETTER PERFORMER  CONDITION WISE CAN WONE TO MORE THAN THAT AND IN TERMS OF THE DURATION OF THOSE WORK OUT WHAT'S YOUR SUGGESTION I I'VE BEEN WAIGT TRAINING FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS RUNNING FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS UM AND MAINLY FOR HEALTH AND HAVE FOUND THAT IF I WORK HARD IN THE JAM ER AT RESISTANCE TRAINING FOR MORE THAN SIXTY MINUTES OR SO VERY HARD FOR ME TO RECOVER ISTRAR GETING COALDS I ST ARE GETTING WEAKER FROM WORK OUT TO WORK OUT BUT AMAZINGLY AT LEAST TO ME IF I KEEP THOSE WORK OUTS TO ABOUT TEN MINTES TEN MINUTES OF WARM UP AND FIFTY FIVES ZRO MINUTES WOR SO OF REALLY HARD WORK FOR RESISTANCE TRAINING AND I KEEP THE CARTY VOSCULAR WORK ABOUT THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE MINUTES I FEEL GREAT AND I SEEM TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS AT LEAST SOME PLACE IN WORK OUT FROM WORK OUT TO WORK OUT I MEAN IT'S DOES HER GOOD NUMBERS CAUSE THOSE HA CIND NUMBERS THAT WE USUALLY PREACH WE TRY TO KEEP OUR WORK OUTS TO AN HOUR OR LESS IF POSSIBLE NOUT DEPENNING UPON THE SPLIT THAT YOU'RE FOLLOWING IF YOU'RE AN A TOTAL BODYS SPLIT THERE'S JUST CAN BE MORE THAT HAS TO BE DONE IN A GIVEN AMOUT TIME I'M THAT A AIN'T AGAIN IF YOU TRAINING PRIMARILY FOR STRAINGTH THAT COULD PROLONG THE WORK OUT AS ALONG THE REST TIMES AND BETWEEN SETS BUT IN GENERAL WHEN YOU'RE NOT FOLCAST ON THAT ONE ASPECT WUT THE OVER ALL HEALTH PICTURE THEM YOU CAN GET THE JOB DONE IN AND UNDER AN UNDER AN HOUR AND AGAIN I ALWAYS SAY ON TOP OF IT IF YOU WANT TO LOOK LIKE N APLY TRAIN LIKE AN APPLY IS YOU CAN EITHER TRAINING LONGER YOU COUL TRAIN HARVAGE CAN'T DO BOTH AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE FOLK IS FOR ME I HAVE A BUSY LIFE I'VE LOT OTHER THINGS THAT I DO BELIEVE OR NOT IN IT'S LIKE I I WANT TO GO HARD AND I WANT GO GET OUT AND I FIND THAT MY BODY ALSO RESPONSE TO THAT IN THING A LOTOGIS BOD AS RESPOND TO THAT AND PARTICULARLY AS YOU START TO GET OLDER I THINK IT'S THE IT'S THE LENGTH OF THE WORK OUT THAT ACTUALLY CAUSES MORE PROBLEMS THAN THE INTENSITY OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE WARMED OUP PROPERLY LIKE YOU SAID I'VE FOUND PERSONALLY THAT MY WARM UP HAS HAD TO BECOME MORBIT INEGRAL PART O MY MY WORK OUT THAN IT EVER HAS BEFORE I NEVER I CAN GET IN THE GIN WHEN I WAS TWENTY AND I'M GOING TO RIGHT OVER A'M DOING ONCE SET TWO SETS OTHEM AND I'M READY TO GO YOU KNOW AND I NEVER DO ANOTHER WORK OUT WARM UPSET FOR ANY THE OTHER EXERCISE OF YOU THE REST OF DAY I'M THAT'S NOT  THAT'S NOT SURE ANY MORE YOU KNOW AND I'VE FOUND THAT AS LONG AS I'M WILLING TO SORT OF GIVE MYSELF A LITTLE O WARM UP THE INTENSITYES NOT WHATL BOTHERS ME YET II'M VERY MUCH IN CONTROL OF THE WEIGHTS I USE AN IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME BUT IF I START TO GO PRETTY LONG I START TO FEEL EIGHY ORRE SOR TO HAVE PROBS SO AGAIN DEPNDING UPON AGE THATS ALSO PLACE A FACTOR IN THE LENGTH BUT AGAIN I THINK EVERYBODY CAN ACHIEVE ON A STANDARD PROGRAMM CONACHIEVE THE RESULTS THAT THEY WANT WITHIN AN HOUR TERMS OF SPLITS YOU MENTION SPLIT AND SO FOR THOSE WHO REN'T FAMILIAR WITH THIS A TERM SPLITS ITS REALLY A WHICH BODY PARTS ARE YOU TRAINING ON WHICH DAYS UM SEEMS A DON'T ALMOST EVERYBODY FOLLOWS A WEEKLY WORK OUT SCHADUEL TH ODY OF COURSE DOESN'T MOT VER RI A W WEEK I DO NO RESONTHING THAT ONCE EVERY SEVEN  OR TIS EVERY SEVEN DAYS MAKES SUNSE PHYSIOLOGICALLY AS TUS THE BODY DOESN'T WORTH THEM BUT THAT'STHE WAY LIFE IS STRUCTURED A I'VE SEEN YOU DISGUSS YOU KNOW THREE DAYS A WEEK WHOLE BODY WORK OUTS AI'VE HEARD OF SPLITS LIKE A PUSHING ONE DAY A PULLING ANOTHER DAY LEGS ANOTHER DAY A DAY OFF REPEAT OM THERE SO MANY VARIATIONS ON THESS WHAT ARE SOME GENERAL THEMES TAT WE CAN THROW OUT THEIR AND IN ORDER TO AVOID THE THE HUGE MATRICKS OF POSSIBLES YOUSE OF WONDERFUL CONTECT THAT POINTS US AND WE WILL CAP BUT IN OUR CAPTION SHOW NOTES WILL LINK OUT TO SOME OF THOSE THEYT A DIFFERENT WAYS TO DESIGN SPLITS BUT IN TERMS OF GIVING PEOPLE A LOGIC AVE HAD A THINK ABOUT SPLITING UP BODY PARTS WHAT'S GOVERNING THE THE SPLIT WHAT WOURD OF THE RULES IN THE LOGIC THAT DICTATE A SPLIT FOR ME THE FIRST RULEIS WILL YOU STICK TO IT IT LIKE IF YOU CAUSE THERE ARE SPLIT I DON'T I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE FULL BODY SPLITS WAS ACTUALLY TALKING TO JUST HY ABOUT THAT THEOTHER DAYLIKE I DON'T NECESSARILY LIKE TO HAVE TO TRAIN EVERYTHING NOW OF COURSE THE VIUMS WILL COME DOWN PUR MUSCLE GROUP BUT IF YOU DON'T LIKE TO DO THAT AND YOU ACTUALLY DON'T LOOK FOR TO YOUR WORK OUT BECAUSE YOU'RE DREADING HAVING TO DO EVERYTHING AND FEELING MAY BE TOO FATIGUED BY THE TIME YOUR WORK OUTS OVER OR THE FACT THAT THOSE GENTLLY DOU TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND DON'T FINTO YOUR SCHEDUL I DON'T CARE HOW EFFECT OF THE SPLIT IS A SPLIT NOT DONE IS NOT EFFECTIVE SO YOU NEED TO FIND ONE THAT FIT SO MAYE YOU GO IN TO AND A'LL TURN ABOPTION LIKE A AM A PUSHPUL LEGS THAKE YOU MENTIONED AND THAT CAN BE DONE EITHER ONE CYCLE THROUGH THE WEEK ONON MONDAY ONCE THEY FRIDAY SPLIT OR COULD BE TWICE IN A WEEKS SER ACTUALLY TRAINING SIX TIMES YOURE WERE YOU REPEAT IT YOUNT PULL PUSH LEGS PULL PUSH LEGS OR ER YO A TEHOWEVER YOU ON'T DO ITHIT WITH EITHER A DAY OFF AND BETWEEN THE THREE DAYS OR AT THE END OF SIX DAYS A AND AGAIN THAT ACTUALLY IMPACTS YOUR SCHEDUL IVE BROKEN THAT DOWN BEFORWARS N IF YOU PUT IT IN BETWEEN THE THREE DAYS IS GOOD BECAUS YOU'RE GIVING YOURSELF AN NEXTRA REST DAY AND BETWEEN BUT IT STARTS TO SHIFT THAT DAY OFF EVERY WEEK AS WE WRAP AROUNDS FOR THOSE GIES THAT WERE CHOOSING THAT SEVEN DAYS CEDUAL OUT OF CONVENIENCE IN OUR HEADS YOU KNOW IT STARTS THE MESS WIT THAT OFF TAY SO OTHERS LIKE TO JUST KEEP YOUR PREDICTIBLY LET DOWN A SUNDAY AN TRAIN SIX DAYS IN A ROW A BUT THAT'S HAT BUT THAT'S A A BETTER WAY THO MAYBE GROUP SIMILAR MUSCLE ACTIONS TOGETHER WHICH I THINK I I DEFTALLY PREFER THAT BECAUSE IF I'M GOING TO BE TRAINING I PULLING MOVEMENTS AT LEAST THET THERE'S A CENTERGY BETWEEN THEM AND I FEEL LIKE A LOOKING TO A CHEEF ONE GOALL THAT DAY A AND THEND I MEAN QUITE ONEUSLY YOU GO BACK TO THE BRO SPLIT DAYS AND THEY'S THOUGH STILL WORK EFFECT THERE'S A REASON WHY THEY WORK IN THE PAST I I THINK THAT SCIENCE SHOWS THAT THERE SMARTER WAYS TO DO THEM THESE DAYS LIKE YOU CAN YOU CAN COME BACK AND HID A RELATED MUSCLE SO YOU COULD DO LET'S THAY BICEPS ON ON DAY AND THEN COME BACK TWO DAYS LATER AND YO BACK REALIZING AGAIN SENERGY BETWEEN THE THE EXERCISEOS THER YOUR BICIS FORN YOUVERE STIMULATED AGAIN SO YOU COULD FIGURE OUT WAYS TO MAKE THAT WORK BUT THE THING THAI THINK IS IS EFFECT OF THERE IS THAT TENDS TO BE ONE OFTHET ONES OF PEOPLE LIKE THE MOST BECAUSE THEY CAN GO IN TO GET THEIR PUMP THEY FEEL GOOD THAT IT'S IT'S PRETTY SOLELY FOCUST ON BLE MUSCLE GROUP IS THAT O DEFINITION OF A BRO SPLIT ONE OS A GROUP THAT YIS HE SAIS VERY MUCH GEARE TOWARD STRENGTH AN ESTHETICS REALLY MACK SOMISING YE CHESTPO DAY I'LL BE MORE MORE AESTHETICS THAN STRAM YE YT YOUR DENSY THE BROW R THE BRONA THE EVIDENTLY I GAND LIKE YOU KOW IN HERE I AM A SIENCE GUY AND I I COULD APPRECIATE THE BENEFITS OF A BROSPLIT ESPECIALLY CAS AGAIN LICEQUET TO WHAT TO WHAT END YOU WHO WHOSE WHOSE GO WE ARE WETRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE THERE'S ER R OURST YOU KNOW LIKE I MEAN IF IF I'M APPLYING MY STANDARDS AN MY GULLS OR EVEN LIKE ATHLETIC IDEALS BUT THEY JUST WANT TO GET IN SHAPE THEN IT'S PERFECTLY FINE TO TO DO IT TO DO A BRO SPLIT IN THAT INSTANCE IF YOU'RE STICKING TO IT AGAIN AND YOUR SEEING THE RESULTS WHIC YOU WANT TO SEE FROM IT BUT THEY'RE ABLE TO YOU DON'T REALLY KEEP THEIR FOCAS ON ONE MUSTLE THEY GET TO FOCUS ON YOU KNOW LIK ILICALOTS HAVE PEOPLE STRUGGLE WITH THE THE WAY OF AAN EXERCISE FEELS UNTIL THEIR SECOND OR THIRD SET BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THAT PROPRCEPTIF ABILITY O CAN O LOCK IN O AN EXERCISE SO SPENDING A FEW NOW I SET THEM THE SAME YO EXERCISE BUT THEN DOING ANOTHER EXCISE ON SAY MUSTLE GROUP HELPS IN THE DIALAND A LITTLE THE BETTER AND GET MORE ATHER TRAINING YET THAT REASON REALLY INTERESTING I THING IMPORTANT QUESTION EARLY ON WHEN I STARTED A RESISTANCE TRAIN WHICH WAS ANNOUNCE SIXTEEN HIGH SCHOOL I GOTIN TOUCH WITH AND I WAS LEARNING FROM MIKEMENCER I MEELI THOU O DO TINTERS   ATTERS  IN AND MIKE WAS VERY HELPFUL A VERY VERY HELPFUL WE GOT TO BE FRIENDLY A LI JUST READ HIS BOOK I A GE GANST THE I OF JEALOUS AR N  I BACK THEN  KNOWING OR NAT I UM YOU MIG PAID MY WESTERN UNION TIPE THING TO TOS SEND HIM SOME MONEY FOR THE BACK OF MYAND THEN HE GOT ON THE PHONE WITH ME AND AND MY MOTHER OF THE TIME WAS LIKE WISEST GROWN MAN  AN THE HOUSE AND HE GAVE ME A A VERY STRAIGHT FOR ARD SPLIT WHICH WAS SHOULDER'S ARMS ONE DAY HE HAD BE TAKING TWO DAYS OFF AND THEN TRAINING LEGS AND N TWO DAYS OFF AND THEN CHESTAMACK ET CETERA AND THEN THA  THAT'S A VARIATION OF BROSPLIT TO WHERE YOUR SORT OF YEO BREAKING THEM DOWN THAT WAY CHEST AN BACK OR CHEST E BISE YOU KNOW YE IHE WORKED VERY WELL FOR ME I PROBABLYWOULD BECAUSE OF MY AGE I THINK AN GIVE THEREWAS THE I WAS UNTRAINED I THINK IT LARGELY ON TRAIN I THING WOULD HAV A GROWN ON ON MANY DIFFERENT PROGRAMMS BUT IT WORKED VERY WELL FOR ME I EVENTUALLY JUST AS I MADE THAT IN EVERY OTHER DAYTHINGS ORS ARMS DAY OFF LEGS DAY OR TWO OFF AS WE IT LEGS RIGHT LEAST FOR ME I'M NOT TRAINING TA   AND THEN NOT DOING MUCH OF ANYTHAN  ATHLETIC THE NEXT DAY AND CHESTBACK IN REPEAT AND SAWN AND THE REASON I FOUND THAT HELPFULS I ALMOST ALWAYS RECOVERED BETWEEN WORKOUTS AM THE TE SIX DAY A WEEK PROGRAMM OF PUSH PUL LEGS PUSH UPLE LEGS TO ME AM SEEMS EXCRUCIATING A'M FROM TWO STANDPOINTS ONE IS AT LEAST WITH MY RECOVERY ABILITIES LACK OF RECOVERY BILLIES I CAN'T IMAGIN  COMING BACK FEELING FRESH THE OTHER ONE IS IF I IF I'M IN THE GIM MORE THAN FOUR DAYS A WEEK I REALLY START TO FATIGUE IT ABOUT THE WHOLE PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIENCE OF IT WHEREAS IF I'M IN THER THREE OR FOUR DAYS A WEEK IN OTHERS IF I PUT A DAY OFF IN BETWEEN EACH WORK OUT I REALLY WANT TO BE THERE AND I GET IN THERE WITH WITH A LOT OF FIRE AM ANIMALS ORE DOING OTHER THINGS ON THE OFF DAYS SO I THINK THAT I LOVE THAT YOU MENTION THA THE SPLIT IT YOU'LL STICK TO AND THAT YOU CAN BRING THE INTENSITY TO  BECAUSE I THINK O THAT TRULY IMPORTANT I SOMETIMES HERE ABOUT TWO A DAY TRAINING I'VE DONE TO A DAY TRAINING TWICE IN MY LIFETIME BOTH TIMES I GOT SICK TWO DAYS LATER THAT CORRELATION NOT CAUSATION BUT AM IS THERE EVER AN INSTANCE WERE TWO A DAY WEIGHT TRAINING MAKE SENSE FOR THE NON DRUGGISIS DID AM TYPICAL RECOVERYABILITY PERSON I ACTUALLY I I THINK IT MAKE SENSE IN SOME CENARIOS BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE PRACTICALLY TO LOT PEOPLE SCHEDUL SO LIKE IF YOU COULD BREAK DOWN LET SAY YOU WERE GOING TO DO EVEN A A O YOU A O SOME VERSION OF OF A TOTAL BODY SESSION OR MAY BE LIKE YOU'RE OING TO DO A AN UPPER LOWER SPLIT I YOU COULD DO AN UPPER WORK OUT AND DO THE ANTER CHAIN OF THE PUSHING PORTION OF THAT IN ONE SESSION AND THEN COME BACK IN DO THE PULLING SESSION LATER ON AT NIGHT IF YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO THE THING THAT YOU BENEFIT FROM THERE IS THE FRESHNESS OF FOCUS AGAIN LIKE SOMETHING IN MY HEAD SACT IS SACRIFICE BUT A TIME YOU GET TOWARDS THE LATTER HALF OF WHATEVER WORK OUT YOUR IN THE SAME POINT YOU MAY BEFORE LIKE WHEN YOU START TO A PROCH THAT FIFTY MINUTES AN HOUR YOU MARK YOU ARE EITHER LOSING FOCUS YOU'RE LOSING ENERGY YOU'RE LOSING CONTRACT BILLABILITY ORE LOSING SOMETHING AND IF YOU'RE RELEGATING WHATEVER IT IS THE PULLING PORTION OF THAT TO THE END OF THAT WORK OUT SOMETHING SUFFER SO THAT OCAN THAT IF TEU REALIZE AT'S HAPPENING THAT MAY BE YOU SWITCH EM UP THE NEXT TIME YOU DO THE WORK OUT WHERE THE PULLING PORTION OF THE UPPER WORK OUT GOES FIRST AND THEN THE PUSHING GOES LATER SO YOUR LEAST NOT JUST CONTINUING THAT CYCLE BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU WERE ABLE TO CON  SPLIT THEM UP YOU GET A CHANCE TO CON TO TAKE A BREAK YOU CAN HAVE THAT FRESHMENS OF FOCUS AGAIN AND YOU CAN AS HOU GET A BETTER EFFORT AND CSE AGAIN I THINK EFFORT DRIVES THO RESULTS SO IF THE EFFORT IS NOT COMPROMISE THAN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT SYSTHEMICALLY IS THAT PROBLEM AND I THINK THAT IT IS A PROBLEM FOR LOT O PEOPLEIS IS HARD TO 'S HAR TO RED THE ENGION UP A LOT OF TIMES DELING THE DAY YOU NOW YOU WARM THAT THING UP ONCE AS LIKE THAT CAR IN THE WINTER YOU GET A GOING ONCE YOUR LUCKY YOU CAN NAY I DRIVE IT THE REST OF THE DAY BUT YOU KNOW F YOU PUT IN THE GARRA AND TRY T START THE NEXT DAY IT IT'S IT'S A PROBLEM SO OU KNOW YOUNG PEOPLE CAN GET AWAY THE LOT MORE THAN THAN OLDER PEOPLE COULD YOU KNOW I'VE NEVER HAD A STRONG RECOVERY QUOTION BUT IF I STICK TO THIS ONE DAY OFF IN BETWEEN EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE TWO DAYS IN ROW TRAINING MAY BE BECAUSE I HAVE TO TRAVEL WHEN I WANT TO MAKE SURE I GET ALL THE WORK OUSE IN CONTHING I SEEM TO BE OQT I LIKE YOUR EXAMPLE OF WAR MING UP THE CAR SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE EAST COAST A EEAST COST OF THOSE OF US FROM THE WEST CO ER  I WE E YOU FOKT OM TH NEAST CAUS IN THE MID OW US GET IT AND CERTAINLY FROM FROM EUROPE IN TERMS OF THE MIXING UP OF CARDIO VASCULAR TRAINING AND RESISTANCE TRAINING A SAME DAY DIFFERENT DAY WHICH ONE SHOULD COME FIRST WHICH ONE L COME SECOND IF ONE MAIN GOALS AGAIN EVERYONE LISTENING HAS DIFFERENT GOALS AR MOST PEOPLED LIKE EITHER MAINTAIN OR GAIN SOME MUSCLE I DO'T KNOW MANY PEOPLE THAT WANT TO LOSE MUSCLE  MAINTAIN OR GAIN SOME MUSCLE USUALLY IN SPECIFIC LOCATIONS ON THEIR BODY MOST PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO BE A BIT LEANER OR LOT LEANER THERRE FEW PEOPLE OUT THERE THATRE EITHER NATURALLY LEAN OR DON'T WANT OR ACTHY JUST WANT A GAINWAIGHT BUT ASSUMING THAT PEOPLE NE T GET LEAN OR PUT ON SOME MUSCLE R MAINTAINED MUSCLE AND WANT TO HAVE A HEALTHY HEART AND A HEALTHY BRAIN WHICH BASY REQUIRES A HEALTH HE CARDY OFASCULAR SYSTEM HOW WOULD YOU IN CORPORATE CARDY OF ASCULAR WORK INTO THE OVER ALL WEEKLY REGIMENT A SO AGAIN I I THINK THAT THE YON THE BARRAMENMUMIS PROBABLY TWICE A WEEK IN TERMS OF CARD OF VASCULAR IF YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME SEMBLANCE OF CART OF ASCULAR CONDITION BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY NEED IT MORE OR WANT TOF PURSUE IT MORE THAN THAT A'RE GOT TO NEED MORE TIME TO DO THAT SO A AT SOME POINT IT CAN'T JUST BE RELEGATED TO A DAY OFF OR A DAY OFF FROM THE FROM THE WAIGHT TRAINING WORK OUS SO AT SOME POINT IT HAS TO OCCUR ON THE SAME DAY YOU KNOW IN IN THAT CASE I JUST LIKE TO PUT IT IF THAT IS YOU'RE NOT YOUR PRIMARY GULL WHITH YOUE LOOKING MORE FOR THE JUST THE OVER ALL PICTURE OF THE AESTHETICS YO MENTION PUTTING MUSCLE ON IN CERTAIN AIREAS THAN I WOULD PUT IT AT THE END OF THE WORK OUT CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT ANANY WAY COMPROMISE THE WAIGT TRAINING WORK WORK OUT AND AS WE'VE SORT OF REFERENCEICABLE TIMES ALREADY T THE INTENSITY OF THOSE WORK OUS IS IMPORTANT AND WE KNOW THERE'S A STRENGTH COMPONENT TO THOSE WORK OUTS ALSO THAT IS GOING TO YOU'L AT BE A HEALPFUL STIMULUS FOR GROVE SO THE CONDITIONING THE CARDIO THATS OF DONE PRIOR TO ANY TRAINING AS TRE TRAINING WORK OT IS LIKELY GOING TO IMPERIER BILLY TO PERFORM AT YOUR BEST SO UNLESS IT'S JUST ON FOR A QUICK LITTLE WARM UP IN THE BEGINNING BUT THEN IT'S NOT SUSTAINED LONG ENOUGH REALLY TO BE OF BENEFIT FOR CART OF ASCULAR CONDITIONING SO I JUST LIKE YOU'LL PUT THAT ATAT THE END REALIZIN THAT EVEN IF MY EFFORT LEVEL IS LOWER MY OUTPUT IS LOWER IF IT'S STILL PLACING A DEMAND O MY CARDAC OU'TPUT TO GET THAT CONDITION N OF FACT BECAUSE I'M FATIGUED IS STILL HAS THAT THE MAND OF MY CARDAC OUTPUT SO STILL ACHIEVING ITS GOAL BUT IT DIDN'INTERFERE WITH MY MANGLE OF BEING ABLE TO INCREASE MY PEFORMS IN THE GIM OT IT AND INTERVERS OF THE FORM OF CARDY OFASCULAR TRAINING I'VE SEEN YOU AM DO A NUMBER OF I HAVE TO SAY A VERY IMPRESSIVE A HIGH INTENSY INTERVAL TYPE WORK SO BURBY TYPE WORK OR PUSH OUPS WITH YOU KNOW WITH CRUNCHES MIXED INTO THE MAND WHEN PEOPLE CONSEE OUR VIDIOS TO DIDN'T DESCRIBE THOSE UM IN THE BEST WAY BUT  RATHER THAN ON THE TREAD MILL OR OUT JOGGING FOR THIRTY FORTY FIVE MINUTES IS THAT BECAUSE YOU PREFER HIGHER INTENSITY A HIGHER HEART RATE TYPE AM TRAINING ORS IT BECAUSE YOU LIVE IN COLD CONNECTIC IT AM  AND YOU DON'T WANT BE OUT JOGGING ON THE ROADS IN THE MIDDLE WINTER A WET I THINK ALL THE ABOVE I MEN THOSE OR FACTORS YEN FROM PERSONAL LEVEL BUT I THINK THAT IF IF YOU ARE IIF WE COULD BLAND FUNCTION ACROSS THESE ROUNDS AND NOT HAVE SUCH A DELINEATION BETWEEN THIS IS MY WAY TRAINING AND THIS IS MY CONDITIONING BUT FIGURE OUT A WAY TO TO BLEND THEM TOGETHER I ALWAYS THINK THAT YOU'VE GET YOU'VE GOT A BETTER OPPORTUNITY GET THAT MORE WELL ROUNDED RESULT AND I LIKE THE KIND OF MIX UP THAT STRAIGHT CONDITION IN WORK AND ALSO SOME OF THE FOOTWORK TE DRILLS TAN WE HAVET WE WE HAVE SOME HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR GUODES TO COME ITO OUR PROGRAMS LIKE TO JUST DO SOME FOOTWORK DRILLS THEY LATTER SLE LADTERS OR ER LINE DRILLS OR SOMETHING AND YOU WHAT HAPPENS PEOPLE BECOME INTRIGUED AND INTERESTED LIKE I NEVER I'VEN'T TRIED THI SINCE A HIGH SCHOOL YOU KNOW AND THEY BECOME INTERESTED IN JUST THE CHALLENGE OF IT AND AS WE BECOME ALMOST DISTRACTED BY THE CHALLENGE WE'RE NOW LIKE FINDING OUR SELVES CONDITIONING YOU KNOW  AND I ALWAYS THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART THAT SOMETIMES YOU GOT A DRAW PEOPLE IN AM TO GET TO SHOW THEM WHAT THEY MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN AND FROM THE OUTPUTTER THE EFFECT OF IT I JUST THINK THAT WE YOU'RE ABLE TO BLEND SOME OT SOMEBODY OF STILL MAINTAIN SOMELA THAT STRENGTH TRAINING INTO THE EXERCISE SS YOU MEN SHO LET SEME DO SOME KINE OF A PUSH UP OR ORP Y I MEAN THERE IS THERE IS A AAN ANAROBE COMPONENT TO THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE HELPFUL A THAT THAN RATHER THAN JUST WALKING OR JUST JOGGING AM NOT US NOT TO SAY THAT THAT ISN'T AN EFFECTIVE MEANS FOR STRICT CARDYAC CONDITIONING IT'S A S ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE'VE HAD FOR Y SENTURIES YOU KNOW TO DO IT BUT I JUST THINK THAT IF WE CAN BLEND IT THAN IT BECOMES MAY BE A BIT MORE INTERESTING AND YOU GET SOME OF THOSE CROSS OVER BENEFITS AND DOESN'T BECOME SO SEGMENTED IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO I LOVE THE IDEA OF BRINGING SOME MENTAL CHALLENGE AND SOME DESIRE TO IMPROVE A SKILL WHILE CONDITIONING THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT AV THOUGHT OF BEFORE IN IT AND IT'S SIMPLY CAUSE I'VE OVERLOOKED IT UT MAKE SENSE BEIS MY SISTER WHOS REASONABLY FIT ALTHOUG ALWAYS TRYING TO GET HER TO DO A BIT MORE AM SHEAYS ASK ME OF WHAT SHOULD I TAKE AND I I DON'T BELIEVER IN SUPPLEMENTS SOME FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE UN CERTAIN INSTANCES BUT I KEEP TELLING HER YOU NOITES IT BEHAVIORS ARE GOING TO AND MYTRITION ARE CANT HAVE THE GREATEST OUTSIE PAUSIFE EFFACT AND SHE LOVES THINGS LIKE AM DANCE CLASSES AND THINGS AT AM WOR TAKE BOXING THESE HOUNDS THINGS WHICH SO MAKE SENSE THAT IF YOU CAN HOOK SOMEBODY ON THE CONDITIONING ASPECT OF THE SKILL ASPECT IN CONT TRICK THEM INTO DOING MORE CARDIO SO TO SPEAK THAT THAT'S TERRIFIC ALSO THE NARROW SCIENTIST IN ME JUST HAS TO SAY FORGIVE ME AM THAT ANY TIME YOU'RE ENGAGING THE OF THE I YOU SETS OF MOTOR NROUNS ONCE IN YOUR BRAIN THE UPPER MOTOR OUNS IN THE ONCES IN YOUR SPON ON COURT ANY TIME YOU'R ENGAGING THOSE UPPER MOTORNER ONS WHICH ARE FOR DELIBERATE A WELL CONTROLLED ACTION YOU'RE DOING A GREAT THING FOR YOUR BRAIN INTFROMS TO BRAIN LONG GEVITY SO AM I'M NOW I NEED TO INCORPORATES SOME ACTURAL SKILLS IN MY TRAINING A GOING BACK TO WAIT TRAINING A BIT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS I LEARNED FROM YOU S OVER THE YEARS WAS THAT WHEN TRAINING TO INCREASE MUSCLE SIZE TO REALLY THINK NOT SO MUCH ABOUT MOVING WEIGHTS BUT MORE ABOUT CHALLENGING MUSCLES YE I ALSO HEARD THIS FROM AM MY FRIEND BEN POCKOLSKY WHO IS VERY WELL COMPLISH I HE WAS A BODYBUILDER NOW HE'S IN TO OTHER ASPECTS OF FITNESS TEACH IS FITNESS BUT DON'T MOVE WEIGHT CHALLENGE MUSCLES UNLESS YOU'REN'T TRYING TO POWER LEFT OR SOMETHING THAT SORT WHICH I'M NOT IMMENSELY HELPFUL BUT THE OTHER THING THAT I LEARNED FROM YOU THAT I A COMBINE WITH THAT WAS THIS IDEA THAT CERTAIN MUSCLES WILL GROW BETTER AND GET STRONGER MUCH MORE EASILY MAYBE EVEN WILL RECOVER BETTER BECAUS OF OUR ABILITY TO CONTRACT THEM REALLY HARD AND THIS I WHAT I CALL THE CAVALIER TEST WHICH IS OF AT LEAST IF IF I COULD PARAPHRASE THE SO FOR INSTANCE IF I CAN UM IT'S ALWAYS THE BYSED ISNT LET'S EUS LET'S USE THE CALF FOR THE BISEP IF YOU CAN IF YOU CAN FLEX YOUR BICEP TO THE POINT WHERE IT HURTS A LITTLE BIT I  ALMOST FEELS LIKE A CRAMP OR A CRAMP RE CONFLEX YOUR CALF TO THE POINT WHERE IT REALLY CRAMPS UP A LOOF IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE ITS NODDING UP THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD INDICATION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO STIMULATE THAT MUSCLE WELL UNDER LOAD IF YOU'RE DOING THE MOVEMENT PROPERLY  AND THAT'S THE FEELING TISHE AIM FOR EACH REPETITION MAY EVEN THROUGHOUT THE REPETITION FOR ME THIS COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED MY RESULTS THIS WAS I THINK IT MAY BE FIVE SIX YEARS AGO THAT I FIRST HEARD THIS FROM YOU BODY PARTS THAT FOR ME LAGGED BEHIND THAT I THOUGHT MAYBE GENETICALLY WORN'K IN A WORD FOR ME IMMEDIATELY JUST STARTED GROWING I RIGHT AND I WAS GETTING STRONGER AND STRONGER I THOUGH THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING SO MUCH SO THAT I'VE DEDICATED A PORTION OF MY RESEARCH ALONG IN COLLABORATION WITH ANOTHER GROUP TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THESE UPPER MOTOR RONS IN THE BRAIN THAT CAN ENGAGE THE MUSCLES EVEN MORE AND THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD OR PUTTING A PUMP INTO THE MUSCLE UM THAT IT'S REALLY THIS MINE MUSCLE CONNECTION IS A REAL THING WHEN IT COMES TO PREDICTING RESULTS AND THAT YOU CAN GET BETTER AT IT SO A FORGIVE ME FOR PARAPHRASING UT YOU'RE INCREDIBLE CONTENT AROUND THIS IT MADE A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE FOR ME AND A NUMBER OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT PASSED THAT ALONG TO BUT  WHAT CAN YOU FIRST O HOW DID YOU ARRIVE AT THAT UM BECAUSE WE HEAR ABOUT THE MINE MUSCLE CONNECTION BUT I REALLY E HEARD IT FIRST FROM YOU HOW DID YOU ARRIVE AT THIS KIND OF CRAMP TST THE CAVALIER TEST AS ALL CALL IT A I'S ALWAYS WORD WHEN PEPLE NAMED THINGS AFTER THEMSELVES OTHER SCIENTIST SO THERE IS NOW OFFICIALLY THE CAVALIER TEST IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN CRAMP THE MUSCLE IN THE ABSENCE OF LOAD JUST I LEXING ITO THE POINT WHERE IT HURTS A LITTLE BIT THAT WOULD BE AND IN A GOOD INDICATION THAT YOU COULD GROW THAT MUSCLE WELL HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH US I M IT' JUST HONESTLY SOMETHING THAT THAT MADE SENSE TO BE BECAUSE DURING MY IT WORK OUT EVEN AS A AS A YOUNG KID JUST STARTING OUT LIKE I ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW WHAT IS AT WORK AND YIL OP YOU'VE LAST AT QUESTION MORE OT THANKLIC WHAT IS IT SUPPOSED TO WORK A LA AND IM I DON'T IF YOU'VE EVER NOTICE BUT LIKE WHEN PEOPLE ASKED THAT QUE H OF THERF THERE BEING TRAIND BY A TRAINER AND THE TRAINER SAY WILL JUST DO THIS DO THIS EXERCISE AND THEY'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO IT BUT THEN THEY'LL SAY BUT WHAT IS IT SPPOSED TO WORE WHERE 'M I SUPPOSED TO FEEL THIS RIGHT PEOPLE IT DIIT JUST INHERENTLY ASKED THAT QUESTION A LOT PEOPLE WILL I WAS ONE OF THOSE THAT DID THAT ANDI ASKED THA QUESTION NOT BECAUSE I NWHITI WAS DOING BUT JUST BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW I WANTEDTO KNOW WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THE WORK ONCE YOU DO THAT AND YOU START TO SEEK THAT OUT AND SO CAT WHL THE BICIP IS WHAT SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THE WORK THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE BICIPS DOING THE WORK RIGHT SO THEN I WOULD JUST SORT OF REALLY IKE TWEAK THE MOVEMENT TO MAKE IT DO MORE WORK OR FEEL MORE UNCOMFORTABLE TO GET A STRONGER CONTRACTION KNOWING IF THAT SUPPOSED TO DO THE JOB IT WASN'T SO PETISCOLD I'M THO LEARNING ALWOL THEEFFLECTION OF THE ELBOW IS THE BREAK YELLS AND THE BIE IN THE BI SUCH RESPONSEFUL FOR SUPERNATIOI YOU SORT I I LEARNED OTHER COMPONENTS OF IT BUT ALL I WANTO KNOW AS TO BRING MY ARM UP IN A CURL WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO DO THE JOB SO I WOULD SEEK OUT WAYS TO MAKE THT HAPPEN BETTER AND WHEN I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT I COULD FEEL THE STRONGER CONTRACTION AND I JUST I DON'T KNOW WHAT I JUST I WAS NO VISINARY I JUST FELT LIKE I I KNEW THAT THAT WAS GOINGTO BE BETTER FOR ME IF THE MUSCLE OUS TRYING TO GROW AS BEING STRESSED MORE EFFECTIVELY SO WHEN I WAS A ATTEMPTING TO DO THIS A CROSS TIF REN EXERCISE IS I WOULD NOTICE THAT WHAT I COULD DO POTENTIALLY OT A CURL WITH MY ARM IS UP IN WHEE YOU ASKED ME TO FLECT MY BYSTEP THAT POSICION I COULDN'T DO IF I WAS YOU KNOW DOING A CONCENTRATION GIRL OR I COULDN'T CARRY OVER TO A CABLE CURL AND THAT SHOULDN'T REALLY CHANGE RI CAUSE THE FUNCTION IS STILL LARGELY THE SAME THERE STILL ELBOW FLECTION THERE STILL SUERNATINLI WHY AM I NOT ABLE TO DO IT THERE AND THAT'S WHENNAT SORT OF CLUDIN TO ME THAT LIKE YOU YOURE MY MUSCLE CONNECTION IN NOT JUST YOURE MIND WITH ONE MUSCLE BUT IN EVERY EXERCISE MATTERS IN VARIES FROM EXERCISE TO EXERCISE AND EVEN IF YOU DON'T GAIN MUSCLE SIZE FROM DOING THAT ALTHOUGH I THINK IT'S VERY HARD NOT TO ESPECIALLY FOR Y NOT USED TO DOING THAT THERE THERE'S A TURM I LIKE TO CALL MUSCULARITY YOU KNOW WHICH IS A DIFFERENT TRIES THE LEVEL OF SORT OF RESTING TONE IN THE MUSCLE THAT IMPROVES DRAMATICALLY YEIF YOU CAN LEARN HOW TO JUST START TO ENGAGE THAT MUSCLE BETTER THE MUSCULARITY THAT RESTING TONE IN THAT MUSCLE IT'S HARDER IT'S MORE IT'S MORE A AT ATTENTION IS TIST MORE IT ITS ITS MORE ALIVE YOU KNOW AND THAT'S ALL DRIVEN FROM BEING ABLE TO CONNECT BETTER NORLOGICALLY WITH THE MUSCLE THAT YOU THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TRAIN I'VE TALKED ABOUT A LOT INEFFICIENCY IS REALLY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SEEK IN MOVEMENTS WHEN YOUR TRYING TO CREAT I PURCHAFY WHEN GOLT WHEN STRENGTH IS YOUR GOAL EFFICIENCY OF THE MOVEMENT IS WHAT YOU LOOKING FOR YOU'RE LOOKIN TO HAVE MUSCLES TIE TOGETHER AND WORK WELL EFFICIENTLY THE CHEST THE SHOULDERS AT TRISEP TO GET A BAR OFF OF YOUR CHEST ER IN A BENCH PRESS YOU'RE NOT LOOK IN TO MAKE IT A VERY INEFFICIEN YO LIVERAGES FOR YOUR CHEST TO TRY TO GROW YOUR CHEST IN A BENCH PRESS YOU'RE TRYING TO LET THE WHOLE PA CTICE COME TOGETHER FOR GREATER OUTPUT BUT WE YOU'RE TRYING TO GO IN CREATE MUSCLE HAVE PURCHASY OR EVEN THIS MUSCULARI THAT TALK ABOUT YOU NEED THE SEEK WAYS TO MAKE IT FEEL MORE UNCOMFORTABLE IF YOU DON'T FEEL THE DISCOMFORT THAT YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG AND I STRUGGLE TO THIS DAY ON CERTAIN MUSCLE GROUPS TO STILL DO THAT EVEN KNOWING WHAT I'M TRYING TO WORK AND KNOWING WITH THE GOAL OF EVERYTHNG O'M PREACHING HERE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR SOME MUSCLES OF  CERTAIN PEOPLE TO DO THIS ON CERTAIN MUSCLES BUT AS YOU MENTION PRACTICE DOES HELP AND THE MORE YOU BECOME YOU'LL CONSISTENT IN DELIBERATE WITH WHAT YO'RE TRYING TO DO THE MORE OFAN OF A RESULT YOU ACTUALLY GET IT'S A COUPLE OF REALLY POOR BOYSID LIKE TO TO A DELF IN TO FURTHER UM FIRST OF ALL MY HUNCH WAS ALWAYS THAT THE MUSCLE GROUPS THAT GREW EASY MOST EASILY AND THAT I COULD CONTRACT HARDEST WITHOUT ANY A H THE FIRST TOMEMINGTO THE CAVALIER TAST GOT TEN OUT ITS AT WE GIVE IT A TEN OUT TEN SCALEI COULD JUST LEC SINCH ISOLATE THOSE MUSCLES SINCH THEM GROW THEM EASILY MN THEIRE CERTAIN BY PARTS I ONT SAY WHICH ONCE AS DOESN'T EALLY MATTER A THAT I ALWAYS FELT LIKE IF I JUSTID PUSH UPS THEY WOULD GROW IN THESE MUSCLES ARE FAR AWAY FOR ANY THE MUSCLES THERE  US WE INVIDE AN PUSH UPS EVEN THOUGH I LIKE TO THING I'M DOING PUSHOPS CORRECTLY UM YOU'LL TELL ME IF IM I'M NOT U BUT SOME OF THAT I THINK IS GENETIC IN SOME OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE SPORTS THAT I PLAYED WHEN I WAS YOUNGER SO I SWAM I PLATE SOCKER I SCAPE WORD AND THEN LATER I BOXED AND SO UM THE MUSCLES IN BOLVED IN THE SPORTS WERE ALWAYS VERY EASY TO ENGAGE LATER WHEN I WENT INTO THE YEM I SO I GUESS AT PERHAPS A CALL TO PARENTS YOU KNOW HAVING KIDS DO A LOT OF DYNAMIC ACTIVITY UM SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA USING IS THIS ISSUE OF O MUSCULARITY I SO GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP THERE ARE I HAVE TO MAGINE A LARGE NUMBER OF LISTENERS WHO DON'T WANT TO GET BIGGER THEY DON'TWANT TO TAKE UP A LARGER CLOTHING SIZE UM THEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP MORE SPACE IN FACT SOME OF THEM WOULD LIKE TO TAKE UP LESS SPACE BUT THEY THEY WANT THAT QUALITY THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING WHICH IS HA YOU KNOW OFTEN TIMES SE YOU HEAR MORE IN THE UM HERE I'M STARTIBING A BIT BUT I WITH KINDNESS A YOU KNOW YOU HEAR FROM WOMEN WHO HAVENINT WAIGHT TRAIN THE SAY I DON'T WANT GET BIG OFTEN SOMETIMES THEY DO BUT THE MOST MOST WOMEN THAT I'VE HELP WAIGHT TRAIN WERE TALKD ABOUT WAGTRUNSAY I DON'TWIN GABT I WANT GAT TONE AND I THINK WHAT THEY'RE REFERRING TO IS THIS QUALITY THAT OF MUSCULAR HUNGERSAN THIS IDEA THAT AT AT RESTING WERE AT CLOSE TO RAST OR ANY TIMES ON REACHES OUT IN CRABS A GLASS THAT THAT THE MUSCLES ALMOST LOOK LIKE THEIR KIND OF TWITCHING IN THE SKIN AND YET IT'S NOT SURAN RAPSKIN AN ADOMY CHART TYPES SKIN I UM SO THIS THING OF MUSCULARITOR OR RESTING TONE YOU HAS A FISIOLOGICAL BASIS I THINK IT'S HOW READILY THE NERVES I OUR COMMUNICANE WITH THE MUSCLES AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT BY LEARNING TO ENGAGE THE MUSCLES MORE ACTIVELY THE RESTING TONE OR MUSCULARITY CAN IMPROVE HAVE YOU SEEN THAT BOTH IN MEN AND WOMEN E AND AND  YOU THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT TAKES UAM UP KEEP A MAINTENANCE OR THAT YOU DON'T WANT YOU DEVELOP THAT MUSCLE YOU CAN JUSTCONTALETIC COAST SO I THINK LIKE EVERYTHING IT KE IT REQUIRES UP KEEP YOU KNOW YOUSUR LOSE IT I DO BELIEVE A FIRMLY BUT LIKE I THINK THAT IT'S THE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONNECTIONS CAN BE HARDER THAN THE MAINANCE OF THE CONNECTION  AS I SAID I STILL STRUGGLE TO THE DAY MYSELF WITH A YOU KNOW UNNAMED MUSSEGROOF SOIT ALSO YOU KOW BUT LIKE NO THERE'S JUST THERE'S THERE'S JUST CERTAIN AM ERE IS THAT ARE HARDER FOR YOUR BRAIN FOR WHATEVER REASON TO JISDEVELOP THAT THAT CONNECTION AT THAT TYPE OF LEVEL TO CREAT CREAT THAT EXERSTRONG CONTRACTION BUT I THINK THAT IT WITH PROPER DEDICATION FOCUS IN IT I'LL GO RIGHT OUT AND SAY YOU KNOW CALVES IS ONE THERE IS THAT I'LL I DON'T NEST TA SURELY HAVE A GREAT CONNETION WITH AND I ALSO OBVIOUSLY MUST NOT CARE SO MUCH CAUSE I DON'T PUT IN THE TIME AN EFFORT TO CRECREATE THAT CONNECTION AS I COULD AM SO I THINK WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IS YOU YATHER COULD BE A STRUGGLE THERE BUT THAT WITH WITH STRUGGLE COMES DISINTEREST PEYU LAKE MELL SKIRIT ON THE UM A I'M A CALF NOT I'M NOT GONG TO TO ANYTHING ABOUT IT YOU KNOW SO I THINK IF YOU PUT THAT THEE TE REQUIRE AT FOR IN IN THE TIME ON RE PETITIONS THAT YOU WILL DEVELOP THAT AN ONCE YOU DO DEVELOP IT IT'S GOING TO STICK AROUND A LOT LONGER THAN IT WOULD HAD YOU NOT INVESTID ANY TIME INTO IT IT ALL AM YOU'RE NOT REQUIRING AS MUCH OF BAT BUT I MEAN I I DON'T KNOW LIKE YOU KNOW YOU MENTION NOW WHEN YOU TRAIN IT'S LIKE YOU'RE YOU'RE JUST THE PART A HEIT TRAIN NOW LIKE YOU'RE GOING HARD YOUR TRYING TO YEN REALLY FORCILY CONTRACT YOU NOT JUST MOVING THE WAY I SAY FROM POINT A TO POINT BE BUT YOU'RE LIKE TRYING TO CONTRACT THE WAIHT THROUGH THAT RANGE AM THAT IS OF MIND SET THAT I TRY TO PUT INTO WHATEVER THEY O'N DOING UNLESS OF COURSE I'M FOCUST ON US STRENGTH EXERCISE WHERE I'M JUST TRYING TO LIFT A GREATER AMOUNT AND USE ALL THE MUSCLES TOGETHER BUT WHEN THE GOAL IS IN EFFICIENCY FOR HYPERCHASY I AM REALLY TRYING TO CREATE THAT CONTRACTION IN ASJUST PART OF MY TRAINING SO I GUESS T HAT YOU THAT FOR CONSISTENCY'S SAKE AS LONG AS O'M TRAINING IS HAPPENING YOU KNOW AS AT IF I IF I GET AWAY FROM TRAINING THAT'S NOT HAPPENING T ALL BUT YOU KNOW EVEN THERE I PROBABLY A ANOTHER EMBARRASSING ADMISSION PROBABLY YOU WILL MINDFULLY DO IT THROUGHOUT THE DAY YOUVE WIN HO WAIHE MY HEAD YOU KNOW IN CERTAIN MUSSAGRES BUT HR  MY ABS OR MY ARM OR MY SHOULDERS OR SOMETHING I'M DOING SOMETHING JUST A SORT OF ENGAGE TO MUSCLES AND I DO THINK THAT SOME OF THAT SORT OF AANAME PRACTICE ACTUALLY HELPS BY TIME YOU GO BACK INTO THE GIM YOU JUST CINTO KEEP THAT YOU KEEP THAT THAT THAT CONNECTION GOING WELL IT CERTAINLY OBAYS ALL THE RULES OF NEUROL PLAST DISITEVE YOU KNOW THE THE FIRE TOGETHER WIRE TOGETHER MONTRE WHICH IS THE WORD TO MY CALLING CARLA SHATS A WHOLD TRUE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF NOURL FUNCTION INCLUDING NERVE TO MUSCLE SO THESE FLEXING THROUGHOUT THE DAY OR THE THE AM DELIBERATE ISOLATION OF OF CONTRACTING A MUSCLE THROUGHOUT THE DAY IS WITHOUT QUESTION ENGAGING YOUR PLASTICITY AND IF YOU WERE DO YOU YOU WERE OF THOSE REPUTITIONS YOU GONG TO GET LESS ENGAGEMENT OF THE NERVE TO MUSCLE CONNECTION I CAN SAY THIS WITH WITH A WITH A SMILE AND AND WITH CONFIDENCE BECAUSE ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS ALL NOR SCIENCE STUDENT'S LEARN IS ABOUT THE NOUROW MUSCULAR JUNCTION CAUSE IT'S IT IT'S A REALLY SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF WARE THE MORE TIMES T HE NERVE FIRES AND GETS THE MUSCLE TO CONTRACT THE STRONGER THAT CONNECTION GET RECEPTORS ARE BROUGHT THERE ET CETERA ET CETERA T THE WHOLE BUNCH OFE MECHANISMS FOR TOPIC TO ANOTHER A PODCASTS BUT U BASICALLY THAT PRACTICES THROUGHOUT THE DAY IS UM MAKES TOTAL SENSE AND WORKS UM ETHERE'S NO THER BELIEVING THRE'S NO SCIENCE BEHIND THAT IN TERMS OF YO THE APPLICATION OF IT YOU DO IT WHEN YOU CATCH YOURSELF DOING IT OU KNO RIGHT HIND THE TIME YE KNOW BUT I IT IS DEAFILIY SOM THAT'S EASILY DONE DISCREETLY AND YEYU YOU MIND UP TO ACTUALLY I THINK IN ANA RESIVILIA WHEN I I DID TALK ABOUT AM GROWING YOUR ARMS BY JUST IMPROVE YOUMPROVING THE CONNECTION NOT THAT THAT CONNECTION ITSELF IS APPLYING ANY LOAD OR OR YOUF RESISTANCE THAT SIGNIFICANT TO CRET OVERLOOK FOR GROWTH BUT IT'S THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT CONNECTION THAT I THEN TAKE BACK WITH ME INTO THE GIM AT A MORE EFFECT OF LEVEL THAT TAKES EVERY EXERCISE I DO THERE AND MAKES A MORE EFFECTIVE IT'S A SHARPENING THE BLEED SO TO SPEAK UM YE CERTAINLY OBEYS THE LAWS OF A A NERVE TO MUSCLE PHYSIOLOGY UM ONE TID JUST TOUCH ON A A COUPLE OF THINGS I IF THE GOAL IS TO CHALLENGE MUSCLES AND ONE IS DIVIDING THEIR BODY INTO LETS AY YOU KNOW THREE OR FORDAY A WEEK SPLET OR SO OR MAYBE UP TO SIX UM HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN A MUSCLES RELIT READY TO BE CHALLENGED AGAIN I'VE HEARD OKAY EVERY FORTY EIGHT HOURS IS  PROTYUENCS INCREAS IS AND THEN WELL GET INTO THIS AND THEN IT DROPS OFF BUT FRANKLY IF Y TRAIN O MY LEGS HARD I CAN GET STRONGER FROM WORK OUT TO WORK OUT OR T LHESE BETTER IN SOME WAY WORK OUT TO WORK OUT A LEG WORK OUT TO LEG WORK OUT TRAINING THEM ONCE EVERY FIVE TO EIGHT DAYS IF I TRAIN THEM MORE OFTEN I GET WORSE SO THET WHATEVER THAT FORTY EIGHT HOUR TO SEVENY TO HOUR THING IS SOMEHOW MY LEGS DON'T OBEY THAT YOU KNOW ORE MAYBE SOMETHING ELSEIS WRONG WITH ME BUT I'M SURE THERE' MANYTHINGS ELSE WRONG WITH ME BUT UM HOW DO YOU ASSESS RECOVERY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL MEANING AT THE LEVEL OF THE MUSCLES IS THAT WILL TIKE OUT SORENESS AND GETTING BETTER STRONGER OR MORE REPETITIONS ET CETERA AND THEN THE SYSTEMIC LEVEL THE LEVEL OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND I'D LOVE O YOU TO TELL US ABOUT THE O THE TOOL THAT AGAIN I LEARNED FROM YOU WHICH IS AFTURLY USING A PHYSICAL SCALE BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THIS IS THAT WILL LET YOU TELL WHAT THE TOOL IS BUT THAT TOOL IS ALSO ACTIVELY BEING USED FOR ASSESSING COGNITIVE DECLINE AND COGNITIVE MAINTENANCE AND COGNAVE FUNCTION IN PEOPLE WITH ILLTIMERS AN DO MENTION I MAKES TOL O SENSE MAKES TOL SENSE I I I SO U REGARDING THE THE UM THE FIRST PART OF THE QUESTION LIKE YOU HOW DO YOU HOW WOULD YOU CINT OF DICTATE WHEN A MUSCLES RECOVERED SO I DO THINK THAT WHAT YOUR EXPERIENCING IS TOTALLY REAL A THAT DIFFERENT MUSCLES RECOVER AT DIFFERENT RACE AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SO FASCINATED BY THIS CONCEPT UM THOUGHT TABOUT IN TERNALLY WITH MUT WITH MY TEEM BUT LIKE I FEEL LI WHAT WE REALLY NEED THE HOLY GRAIL TO TO TRAINING IS GOING TO BE WHEN WE'RE ABLE T CRACK THE COD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS WHEN A MUSCLE IS RECOVERED AND THAT IS GOING TO DICTATE ITS TRAINING SCEDULE AND THE FACT THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE A BYSTEP THAT CAN BE TRAIND YOU VE WE A PULLING WORK OUT OF REGULAR BYCLET THAT IT CAR WORK IT FORGET THE SPLIT AT THE MOMENTYOU MAY HAVE A BYCET THAT'S ABLE TO BE TRAIN THAT CAN BE TRAINED AGAIN THE NEXT DAY YOU KNOW AND THEN THE NEXT DAY IT AY MAY BE NEE TO DAY OFF AFTER THAT LIKE YOU KNOW IN THAT THAT CAN VARY FROM PERSON A PERSON FOR SURE AND IT CAN VARY FROM MUSCLE TO MUSCLE IN THAT PERSON OVER THE COURSE OF TIME AS YOU MENTIOND BECAUSE THE SYSTEMIC RECOVERIES GET IN PACT ALL THOSE MUSCLES ANYWAY BUT LET SAY YOU'RE SYSTEMICALLY RECOVERING EVERY MUSCLE ITSELF IS GOING TO HAVE U A O YOU KNOW A RECOVERYRY AND I THINK WHAT'S FASCINATING IS THAT WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT BEFORE WE LIKE TO TRAIN THIS WEKER WE HAVE A LIKE THE WAY OUR MIND LOOKS AT TRAINING WOT IF THAT WAS THE CASE THAT THE BYSEPS THAT BYSEP IS A SLAVE TO THE REST OF YOUR TRAINSPLIT YOUARE US LIKE WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE ALSO AT THE END OF EVERY EIGHTH DAY OR YOU KNOW OR WHATEVER WHEN IT MIGHT BE SPON BETTER TO SOMETHING MUCH MORE FREQUENTLY AND YOUR LEGS ARE ALSO BEING THROWN INTO THAT MAXSTAS IT MIGKE MENSER CONCEPT WOR HE'S LIKE THE ON TRAININ YOU KNOW ONE SET AND BE DONE FOR FOURTEEN DAYS I MEAN YOU KNOW IT THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S SUCH VARYABILITY BETWEEN MUSCLEGRUPS IN YOU'R YOU'RE LINKING THEM ALL TOGETHER O I I THINK THAT COMING BACK IN USING MUSCLE SORENESS AS A GUY LINE FOR THAT IS IS ONE OF THE ONLY TOOLS WE HAVE IN TERMS OF THE LOCAL LEVEL YOU KNOW WE DON'T REALLY HAVE YOU BEING ABLE TO MEASURE LET SAY A P Q LEVELS IN SIDE OF A MUSCLE WOULD BE AMAZING YOU KNOW AT AT A LOCAL LEVEL TO SEE HOW HOW RECOVERED THAT MUSCLE IS BUT THAT BECOMES FAIRLY INVASIV AT LEAST TO MY KNOWLEDGE BECOMES FAIRLY INVASIVE SO WHAT ARE OUR TOOLS I MEAN I I THINK THAT AT THE BASIC LEVEL THESCLE THAT MUSCUL CAN RELATE TO AN EASILY IDENTIFY AND THEN USE THAT AS A GUY LIN IF YOU'R TRAINING WHEN YOU'R REALLY SORE A IS PROBABLY NOT A GREAT IDEA AND THAT ITS PROBLY GOOD INDICATION THAT THAT MUSCLES NOT RECOVERED BUT AT LEAST HEARING WHAT YOU AND I ARE SAYING HERE MIGHT BE A COMFORT TO THE PERSON SAY YET IT IS POSSIBLE THAT'S NOT RECOVERED JUST BECAUSE FORTY EGHT HOURS OF THE RECOMMENDATION AND JUST BECAUSE RESEARCH POINTS TO MUSCLE PUTTING CYTHIS IS NEEDING ARE RE STIMULATION WELL MAY BE NOT MAYBE YOU'RE NOT NECESSARILY THERE YET YOU'RE IN THAT AND FOR THAT MUSCLE YOU'RE NOT THERE YET A SO'S ALL REALLY INTERESTING STUP BUT AS FAR AS THE THE A THE SYSTHEMIC YOU RECOVERY I THING ITE'S A LOT OF WAYS YOU YOU TALK ABOUT RESTING HEART RATE MEASURED IN THE MORNING O AT ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF OF A YOU COR TEMPERATURE AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT MIGHT BECOME ALTERED IN A STATE OF A NON RECOVERY BUT GRIP STRENGTH IS VERY VERY MUCH TIED TO PERFORMANCE AND RECOVERY AND WHEN OUS OF THE METS WE USED TO ACTUALLY TAKE GRIP STRENGTH MEASUREMENTS IS A BASE LINE IN SPRING TRAINING ALL A TIME NOBVIOUSLY THE BASEBALL PLAYER YOURE GRIPPIN A BAD YOU PICTURE YOU'RE GRIPPIN A BOLLIC YOU GRIP HAVING GOOD GRIP STRENGTH IS IMPORTANT SO F WE OU NOTICE TI WE HAD A VERY WEAK GRIP IT'S JUST A GOOD FOCAL POINT OF A SPECIALIZED TRAINING COMPONENT FOR HE YOURTHERS EVERY DAY WITH THOSE GUSS NOW WE DO IIN SPRING TRAINING WITH YOU SORT OF A BASE LINE ENTRY LEVEL MEASUREMENT AND THEN WE WOULD WE WOULD MEASURE IT THROUGHOUT THE SEAS ON MAYBE ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS OR THREE WEEKS AND IN IN THEOR THE IDEA THERE WAS TO TO MANAGE TO YO MANAGE O RECOVER MEASURE THE RECOVERY A THIT US GAVEN AWAY YOU KNOW THERE TO TO TO O TO DETERMINE OVER ALL RECOVERY YOU'RE GRIP STRAINGTH IS PRETTY HIGHLY CORRELATED SO WE HAVE FOUND THAT WAT WITH ONE OF THOSE SCALES THOSE OLD FASHIONED BATHOM SCALES AT LIKE A THE BATHEN BEONOR OF YOU CAN GET WHICH BY THE WAY ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE I BELIEVE JUST IN OURE SEARCHING FOR THE LAST SCALE TO PUT IN THAT VITIO AND WE ALMOST COULDN'T FIND ON AUS EVERYTHING IS LIKE DID IT AL ON EVEOOT TIS O'M LUG I THE OLD FASHIONED DIAL CONTROLS 'S IE HAM OLD MACKIN TOSHAS TERS TA THERES A HUGE MAR EM AN   PHONE N AN HKEEP YOUR PHONES NOW AN THIRTY YEARS THE AMPHONE NOW I WER THE LOT O YOARING ALOT TO YOU KNOW I WOUND U A A YOU KNOW FINDING ONE AND IT'S A GREAT  TOOL FOR JUST SQUEEZING THE THE THE A THE SCALE WITH YOUR HANDS AN SEEING WHAT TUP ABOUT PUT YOU CAN GET A I THINK WE ALL CAN RELATE TO THIS WHEN YOU JUST VISU LIZES IMAGINE THE LAST TIME WOU WERE SICK ERE TH WERE YOU ORE JUST TRY US YE NEXT TIME YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING WHEN YOU FIRST WAKE UP IN THE MORNING YOU STILL GROGGY TRY SQUEEZE YOUR HAND TRY TO MAKE A FIST AS HARD AS YOU CAN YOU GESS THAT THERE ANGRY AT YOUR FIST BECAUSE IT WON'T CONTRACT IS HARD AS YOU KNOW IT CAN YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO JUST CREATE THE OUTPUT AND THAT IS BECAUSE IN THAT STATE YOU'RE STILL SLEEPIER STILL FATIGUIA YOUR YOU'RE NOT EVEN AWAKE  THE THEO THE THE WHOLE LEVEL OF THIS POINT WELL THAT IS THE THAT IS STILL A A ANACTUAL PHENOMENA THAT HAPPENS THAT THEO A A LACK OF RECOVERYOR LACK OF WAKEFULNESS OR WHAT EVERY ONE SAY IS IS GOING TO LEAD TO A DECREASED OUTPUT THERE SO WHEN YOU START THE MEASURE THAT ON A DAILY BASIS YOU GET A PRETTY GOOD SENSE OF WHERE YOU'RE AT AND I THINK WHEN PEOPLE START TO SEE A DROP OFF OF TEMPER SAN OR SO OR OR EVEN GREATER O OF THEIR A GRIP OUTPUT A YOU REALLY SHOULD SKIP THE GIM THAT DAYBES I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH YOU'R GING TO DO THERE THAT'S GOING TO BE THAT THAT BENEFICIAL EVEN IF IT IS THE DAY THE TRAIN LEGS ARE WHATEVERY DAY IT IS I I LOVE THIS TOOL IT'S SIMPLE ITS LOW COST IF YOU CAN FIND SUCH A SCALE YES YOU CULD ALSO FIND ONE OF THOSE GRIPPERS THAT AM AND YOU DIDS IN A VERY NON QUANTITATIVE WAY A BUT BETTER WOULD BE A SCALE WE CAN AUSHE MEASURE HOW HARD YOU CAN SQUEEZE THIS THING AT GIVEN TIME A DAY I IT DRAWS TO MIND JUST TE OLD ADNOR A SCIENCED FACT WHENY IN THE WORLD OF CIRCATIAN NOROBIOLOGY ONE OF THE CONSISTINT FINDINGS IS THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR NIGHT TIME YOU'LL THE WEIKE PEOPLE UP AN THEY'LL SAY DO THIS TEST AN THE LABORATORY THAY USE A DIFFERENT  APPARATUS BUT THE SENTUALLY THE SAME THING AND INTHE MILL THE NIGHT GRIP STRENGTH IS VERY VERY LOW AND IF YOU KNOW MID MORNING GRIP STRENGTH AS HIGH AND AS THE BODY TEMPERATURE GOES UP INTO THE AFTERNOON GRIP STRENGTH IT HIGHER AND HIGH AND HIGRON LHEN DROPS OFP TES A CIRCATIAN RITHM AND GAR TEMPERATER TOU YYO ON DOS TAT MORE OR LESS THE SAME TIME EACH DAY YOUN USE IT BUT IT I THINK IT'S BRILLIANT AND IM IN ITS SIMPLICITY AND IT'S DIRECTNESS TO THESE UPPER MOTOR NER ONS CAUS THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT'S ASSESSING YOUR BILITY AGAIN IT'S ABOUT THE ABILITY TO CONTRACT THE MUSCLES HARD IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT YOU'RE NT THIN AGAT AN EFFECTIVE WOR YE THEY ALSO I MEEN THERE  CERTAINLY ARE MORE SOPHISICATED TOOLS TO US AS A A PT THAT WE HAVE A A HANGRIP TINOMOMETERS AND WE CAN A WE CAN MEASURE ONE SIDE AT A TIME TO I'LL NOT REALLY IM M GETTING A LITTLE BIT BLINDED BY THE FACT THAT BOTH HANDS OF SQUEEZING INTO THAT SCALE IN I'LL GET REATHE LEFT RIGHT COMPARISOND BUT EVEN AT THAT LEVEL THAT CUL GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT ORE DETEIL THAT THAT COMES OF THE COST OF THA PRETT EXPENSE OF THE VICES BUT IF IS LISTEN IF YOU ERE AN ATHLE YOU THE THE TWO HUNDRED THREE HIND BOXS IT COST TO HAVE ONE OF THOSE WOULD BE WELL WORTH  THE AD AN INVESTMENT WELL AND I'M SURE SOME OF OUR LISTENERS WERE WANT ONE TO CAUSE THEY'RE A LOT OF A TE GEAKS OUT THERE IM NOT TECKIN DISTREE GEAKS BUT YOU LIKE  LIKE TECKYER I WHAT'S IT CALLED AGAIN IS A HANDGRIPED INOMOMETER GRIPPED ONE IN A DONE NO MATTE I' SAID O O SAID IOF WITH IT WITH THE GREAT EASTCOSE ACTEN BY ME IN A TERRIBLE ABOTCHED IT A WEST COAST VERSION IM THANK YOU WELL WILL A PUT THAT IN THE SHOWNOTS ALSO IM I THINK RECOVERY IS KEY WE ALWAYS HEARE ABOUT SLEEP YUGROW WHEN YOU SLEEP AND INCIDENTALLY YOUR BRAIN YOU STIMULATE LEARNING WHEN YOU'RE AWAKE OBVIOUSLY BUT THE REORDERING OF NERL CONNECTIONS HAPPENS IN SLEEP THIS IS WHY SLEEP IS THE WAY TO GET SMARTER PROVIDED YOU'RE ALSO DOING THE LEARNING PART THE SLEEVES AWAY TO GET STRONG R FIVD YOU'RE ALSO DOING THE TRAINING PART YOU'VE GOT SOME REALLY INTRYOU'VE PUT OUT INTERESTING CONTENT OVER THE YEARS IN TERMS OF A EVEN SLEEP POSITION I ONE OF THE MAJOR CHANGES THAT I MADE TO MY SLEEP BEHAVIOUR IS TO NOT HAVE THE SHEETS TUCKED IN AT THE END OF THE AND I'LL TELL YOU THIS HAD A PROFOUND IMPACT ON SEVERAL THINGS FIRST OF ALL MY FEET HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE BANE OF MY EXISTENCE BROKE THEM UBON SCAPE WORDING THEY I AND I NOTICE WHEN I'D RON ID GET SHIN SPLINTS AND AND THEN I STARD TO NOTIE THAT MY FEET SORT OF UM  YOU'RE THE P T THERE KIND OF FLOPPY IN THE YOURSO AS IF I WAS PPOINTING MY TOE SLIGHTLY ALL THE TIME AT REST IF IS IM AND I REALIZE THAT BASED ON LISTENING TO YOU PREVIOUSLY THAT MY SHEETS WERE RAP TIGHT NOT HOTEL TIGHT RIGHT RIGHT  NOTHING IN THE HOTEL BE FER AND I STARTED I'M RELEASING THAT THE SHEETS AT THE END OF THE BED AND I ALSO STO OUR DOING SOME TOBE ALIS WORK I A FRONT OF SHIN'S WORK ESSENTIALLY CHANGED EVERYTHING MY BACK PAIN FROM RUNNING MY SHIN SPLINCS DISAPPEARED MY POSTURE IMPROVED ALTHOUGH I MY AUDIENCE WILL TELL ME THAT IT STILL NEEDS IMPROVEMENT THERE I'S FIVE OR TEN PEOPLE AT ONCE IT UPSTRA IVE OUT SHEU HAD CHAIRS AND TARMALRAS IA VERY NICE TARS RI I SAW 'M TRYING BY I'M TRYING THERE IM BUT THIS IS FASCINATING RIGHT IM THE POSITION THAT ONE SLEEPS AND I ID FORTUNATELY HAVE NEVER HADING SHOULDER ISSUES ND OC COME WOOD BUT THIN YOU COUL JUST TALK TALKD UST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SLEEP AND SLEEP POSITION FORSAKE OF WAKING POSITION AND MOVEMENT IS THIS I THINK IS A VERY UNIQUE AND VERY POWERFUL WAY TO THINK ABOUT SLEEP THIS PART CAST HAS DONE A LOT OF EPISODES ABOUT KEEPING THE ROOM COOL GETTING SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES ITSED O OW TO GET INTO SLEEPIN BUT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT PHYSICALLY WHAT POSITIONS MIGHT BE BETTER TO SLEEP INTO A PLEASE PLEASA ENRICHUS YET I AN FIRST OF ALL THAT YOU  SOME PEOPLE'S OPINIONS OF OF THAT TYPE OF CONTENT AS THAT YOU YU KNOW YOU SLEEP IN THE COT THE POSITION THAT'S MOST COMFORTABLE TO YOU AN SURELY YOUR SLEEPING GREAT I I UNDERSTAND THAT WE ALL WANT OF SLEEP THAT'S THE GO EN WE PUT OUR HAD ON THE PILLOW AS ACTUALLY FALL ASLEEP AND WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND NOT KNOW WHAT THAT'LL HAPPEN UNLESS YOU HAD A DREAM BUT YOU KNOW BEYOND THAT THERE ARE CERTAINLY PHYSICAL COMPONENTS TO SLEEP THAT THAT IS WHY LOT OF TIMES PEOPLEWAKE UP AND SAY LIKE YUAT THAT YOU CAN INCUR PRETTY SERIOUS INJURIES AND SLEEP PEOPLE WILL WAKE UP AND HAVE LIKE A SHOULDER THAT DID NOT BOTHER THEM AT ALL BE HOM IN THE NEXT DAY OR EVEN FOR WEEKS AFTER BECAUSE OF THE ONE SLEEP POSITION THEY PUT THEMSELVES IN IN A PROLONGED WAY AND THEY HAPPEN TO HAVE A DEEP SLEEP EVEN THROUGH THE DISCOMFORT A THAT CAN DO ACTUALLY SOME SOME SOME DAMAGE SO IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THE BODY CAN INCUR SOME STRAIN AND STRESS IF YOUR SLEEPING IN THE WRONG WAY ONE THE THINGS I SAY RIGHT UP THE BAD IS SLEEPING ON YOUR STOMACH DOST DOESN'T REALLY HAVE MANY BENEFITS YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'R PUTTING YOURSELF INTO A POSITION THAT IS DEPENDING UPON THE THE THE ORANTATION OF YOUR YOUR MATTRESS OR HOW MANY PILLARS YOU'RE USING PUT YOU'R BASINLY PUTTING YOURSELVES INTO A EXCESSIVE EXTENSION A THE LUMBARS PINE WHICH FOR MOST PEOPLE ISN'T VERY GOOD IF YOU'RE IF YOU'R DISPATION A I GUESS THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL YOU KNOW FOR FOR RELOKING THE DISK BUT I MEAN FOR THE MOST PART A YOUR HANDS ARE THEN USUALLY NOT AT YOUR SIDES BUT THEY'RE UP UNDER YOUR ARMS YOU'VE GOT THEM INTO SERT OF INTERNROTATION UP OVER ELEVATION IN YOUR HEAD IT'S THIS NOT A GREAT POSITION YOU ALL SOVE TO CRANK YOUR NECK FOR ONE SIRE THE OTHER NOR TO BREATHE ORE YOU BE YOUR FACE DOWN STRAIGHTENTO THE PILLOW SO I WOULD SKIP THAT ONE AND THERE SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE TOTAL BELLY SLEEPERS AND I AND I WOULD JUST SAY LISTEN I DON'T THINK THAT IS THE THE MOST HEALTHFUL LONG TURN WAYE FOR YOU TO SLEEP TRY TO ADOPT THE DIFFERENT POSITION A SLEEPING ON YOUR SIDE OFF IN TIMES IS IS ALSO BROUGHT ALONG WITH THAT THE LEGS AND NEES COMING UP TOWARDS THE CHEST PROLONG HIPFLECTION LESTE'T WERE DOING ENOUGH FOR THAT DURING THE DBEAS YE WON WER EIN RIGHT RI REAY REALLY TO DO ATOUT TEN HOUR ATOR EIGHT HOURS OR SOME WHERY AT NIGHT LIKE THAT YOU KNOW AN IT'S JUST IS REINFORCING YOU AND AS WE SAID TOO YOU LET'S SAY YOU TRAINED THAT DAY YOU JUST REINFORCING MUSCLE SHORTENING OVERNIGHT KNOW WERE WERE THE BODY IS HEALING AND TRYING DO CREAT SO YOU KNOW CHANGES IN YOUR BODY A NO WOTHER REASONS WHY RECOMMEND STRETCHING OUR STATIC STRETCHING PRIOR TO GOING TO BED LY PEOPLE DON'T REALLY WANT TO DO IT AT THAT POINT AUS IT COULD TAKE TEN MINUTES FIVE TEMTENCE PEN IN PON HOWMING MUSCLES YOU HAVE TO STRESSH BUT NOW IT'S GOOD SORT OF TRY TO ESTABLISH IS LONGER LENGTH TEMPORARILY PRIOR TO GOING INTO A STATE WHERE YO'RE TO BE NOT MOVING AND RECOVERING AN IN IN CREATING YOU A CHANGES IN THE MUSCLE SO A YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF I DON'T SAY IT DOESN'T RULE OUT THE THESIDE SLEEP PROSIDE SLEEPER COULD BE VERY VERY HELPFUL FOR SOMEBODYAT HAS APPENE OR YOU KNOW OTHER OTHER CONDITION SO AGAIN IT'S NOT AN ALLER NOTHING APPROACH BUT IT JUST SOMETHINGTHAT YOU NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO UM WHEN YOU ARE ON YOUR BACK LIKE YOU ERE TALKING ABOUT IN YOUR FEET ARE WEDGED UNDERNEATH A TIGHT SHEETS AT THE END OF THE BED AND MOST OF US UNLESS WE CONSCIOUSLY ARE PULLING THEM UP DON'T PREFER OUR BEDS TO HAVE ORLY LOOSE SHEETS AT THE END OF THE BED HARD TO MAKE TO THET IN THE MORNING RIGHT SO IT'S LIKE  YOU'RE GOTTA ONE TO HAVE THEOF THEM TIGHT WELL I' 'M UM SAYING AS YOU EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE O THES THIS AY PROLONGED PLAN REFLECTION THAT'S GOING TO LIKELY LEAD TO SHORTER YO CALVES OVER TIME AM BECAUSE YOU'RE LACKING ALL THAT LENGTH FOR THAT LONG PERIOR TIME THAT YOU COULD HAVE IF YOU JUST LOOSENED UP THE SHEETS AND ALLOWED YOUR FEET TO JUST YOUON'T HANG OUT WHERE THEYE ARE NOW THE RESTING POSITION OF THE ANKLE HATIS NOT IN DOORSIFFLECTIONS GON TO BE STILL IN SOME PLANORFECHION BUT NOT BE DRIVEN DOWN AND PULL DOWN INTO THAT POSITION UM AND I THINK WHAT HAPPENS ACTUALLYAS PEOPLE WHO GET UNCOMFORTABLE THAT WAY EVEN IN THEIR SLEEP WILL SHIFT AWAY FROM THAT BY TRANING EITHER ON TO THER SILE OR STOMACH SO THERE'S DEAFILY AN IMPACT OF THE BODY POSITION AND SLEEP AND FIGURING HAVE THE BEST WAY THAT YOU CAN STILL SLEEP OF COURSE AND GET YOUR REST BUT HAVE A MINDFLI TOWARDS WHAT IS DOING TO YOUR BODY AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT'S LEAST AOW ABRACEIP TO YOUR BODY IS THE WAY YOU SHOULD GO TERRIFIC AND AGAIN IT'S REALLY HELPED ME AND UM A I BIG BELIEVER BASED ON GOOD SIENCE OUT OF STAMFORD AND ELSEWHERE UM THAT YOU KNOW AS MUCH AS WE CAN BE NAZAL BREATHERS AND SLEEP WE PROBABE SHOULD BE I DON'T KNOW YOU'VE DONE ANY CONTENT TO U YET ABOUT I TAPING THE MOUTH SHUT WITH SOME MEDICAL TAKE BUT YIVE IT THE THE BENEFITS OF NAZAL BREATHING AND SLEEP ER PRETTY TREMENDOUS BUT IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF TRAINING I WILL DO AND THE TRAINING IS VERY SIMPLE IT'S I WILL PIECE OF MEDICAL TAPE SO UM AGAIN A TOPIC FOR ANOTHER TIME I'M GLAD YOU MENTION STRETCHING I WASK CAND ASK ABOUT STRETCHING A A BIT LATER BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT STRETCHING UM WHEN'S THE BEST TIME TO STRETCH FOR PARTICULAR TYPES OF RESULTS AND MAYBE YOU CALD DEFINE SOME THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF STRETCHING IM YEU JUST MENTION A A LITTLE BIT OF UM WOULD YOU CALL LIGHT STRETCHING OR IL GET I'M COMPLETELY NI EVE HERE ON STRETCHING SO LEMME TU SAY I CAN THINK OF STRETCHING WHERE I HOLD THE STRETCH AND REALLY TRYING E UM LENGTHEN IN AIR QUOTS FOLKS O  THE P TS JUMPIN ALL I KNW WHAT IT IS BUT NUTRICION AND THE PTS ON LINE AR REALLY THEY GOT PITCH FORKS IN BOTH HANDS ICTATI THAT'S A REASON A THT'S A REASON EVOLUTION I THINK I SER NOT NUTRICIONS MUCH BUT THE PTS HAVE BECOME A LITTLE BUT ANGRY THESE TDAYS I SEE WHILL I ALWAYS SAY WIT FEELINGS OF POWERLESSNESS COMES AGGRESSION VEY THAT FOLKS SO UM IN ANY IN ANY CASE UM THEY'RE STRETCHING WHERE I'M I'M YOUN TRYING TO CONSCIOUSLY UM LINGTHEN AGAIN IN AIR QUOTES THE MUSCLE I'M NOT UM YANKING ON THE LIMB O BOBBING UP AND DOWN TMAD YOU CALD DEFIND THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF STRETCHING PEOPLE MAYBE GIVE US SOME ROUGH GUIE LINES ABOUT WITH E NOUHT TO DO IT COLD OR WARM BEFORE TRAINING AFTER TRAINING ET CETERA SO YET THERE THERE'S NOT VES THAT ES A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF STRETCHING THAT CAUN GET EVEN TO YO PONEUF STRETCHING IN THINGS THAT ARE LITTLE BIT MORE A YO NITCH BUT LIKE IN GENERAL H TO BASIC FORM TO STRETCHING OR ACT OF STRETCHING AND PASSIVE STRETCHING M YOU'RE YOR IN YOUON YOUR DYNAMIC WORK AND  IN YOUR PASSIVE STRETCHING IS DONE WITH THE GOAL OF TRYING TO CREATE AN INCREASE A IN A THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE MUSCLE SO WHETHER YOUR ACTUALLY INCREASE IN TA LENGTH OF THAT MUSCLEWAT YO MORE SO E YOUR DOING IS INCREAS IN THE RESIST THEIR DECREAS IN TH RESISTANCE OF THAT MUSCLE TO ONE OF STAY AT A CERTAIN LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY SO WHEN WE CAN SORT OF TAKE THE BREAKS OFF AND ALLOW THAT MUSCLE TO TO ALLOW US MORE RANGE OF MOTION WERE INHERENTLY IN INCREASING FLEXIBILITY WITHOUT IN SILY HAVING TO INCREASE THE LENGTH OF THAT MUSCLE A THAT IS USUALLY DONE AT A TIME FAR AWAY FROM YOUR WORK OUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE SHOWN WHERE THIS TYPE OF STRUTCHING DUMB PRIOR TO IN ACTIVITY AND IT COULD BE A LIKE A STRUCTURED ACTIVITY LIKE OLIKE LIFTING OR COULD BE AL BIT LESS STRUCTURE LIKE COMPETING A SPORT IN I IN A SPONTANEOUS TYPE AWAY THAT THERE IS A PERIOD OF RECALIBRATION THAT IS NEEDED AFTER DOING THIS BECAUSE YOURE DISRUPTING THE LENGTH ENCHO RELATIONSHIP OF TH MUSCLE THAT CAUSES YOU TO NOT NECESSARILY BE ABLE TO RELY ON THESE IVE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE STORED MOTOR ANGRUMS IN YOUR MIND IN TERMS OF THIS IS THE PATTERN FOR HOW I SWING A GOLF CLUB SAY YOU KNOW AM NOW INTRODUCING A LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY OR AD IN FLEXIBILITY OR RANGE BECAUSE OF THE STRETCHING I DID BEFORE IT TAKES MAY BE A WHOLE OR TO OR THREE TO MATCH UP AGAIN OH THIS IS THE THIS IS WHAT YIS TRYING TO DO THAT GULSLING THAN I THAT I REMEMBERID AGAIN LIKE IS NOT REMEMBERING THAT EVERY COMPONENT LIKE I HAVE TO BEND BY RIGHT RISKBACK TEN DEGREES AND I HAVE TO BEEND MY ELBOW IND AFTER LIKE YOUR BODY STORES THESE PATTERNS FOR MOTOR EFFICIENCY SO IN WHEN I HAVE TO START MATCHING UP THAT STORED PATTERN WITH WHAT'S FEELING KNEW BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED RANGE I CAN IMPAIR A PERFORMANCE AND AGAIN IT CAN HAPPEN EVEN A GIM WORKD OUT WHERE YOU TALKING ABOUT YOUR FIRST SECOND SET THIR SET A WERE IT MAYBE THE REPROCAUTIONS AREN'T AS BIG CAUSE O JUST DO  YOUEXTUR SETS BUT IN PERFORMANCE IF YOU SCRIPT YOUR FIRST THREE AROUNDS YOU PLAN ON PUGTORIN TO SHOT I Y YOUR SIX OVER AFTER THREE OR YOU DOR DONE ENOSO I THINK IT MATTERS THERE A AS FAR AS THE DYNAMIC YOURE SO WE SO WE RELEGATE THAT AS I MEANTION SHOWARD TOWARDS THE END THE DAY WHEN IT'S NOT GOING TO IN PACK PERFORMANCE BUT EVEN MAY BE HAVE THE ADDITIONAL BENEFIT OF CREATING THE THE FEELING OF LENGTH OR THE INCREASE OR DECREASE IN RESISTANCE TO THIS LENGTH A AT A TIME WHEN I KNOW MY BODY IS GOING TO TRY TO TEND TO HEAL AND HEEL SHORTER NEVER LONGER BUT HEL SHORTER SO IF I CAN INTRODUCE A LITTLE BIT OF THE EXTRA A LENGTH OR OR DECREASE RESISTANCE TO TO THAT LENGT I'S A BETTER TIME TO DO IT SO I THINK OF PROMOTES A A BETTER RECOVERY A IF I WANT TO STRUT A STARRET INTERRUP YOU STRETCHING LATER IN THE DAY A BECAUSE I A I'M ENTREAGED BY THIS CONCO OF HEEL SHORTER YESO PART OF THE HEALING AND RECOVERY PROCESS MEANS A SHORTENING IN THE MUSCLES THIS IS THE TENSING UP IN ELY YOW COULD YOU LABORATE JUST A BIT ON THAT AND THEN TAT TAR TO BREAK YOUR FLOW BUT THE UT A AN GAN NUCHUS BASICALLY KNOW WHAT WHAS BEEN SHOWN AS THAT WHEN WHEN THE THE REPAIR PROCESS MUSCULAR PAIR FROM LESA STRIKE TRAINING DURING THE DAY THE REPAIR PROCESS USUALY RESULTS IN A MUSCLE THAT IS SLIGHTLY SHORTER RATHER THAN INCREASED HIN LENGTH YOU KNOW IT INSIST THAT IT'S YOU MUSCLES PREFER THE SORT OF YOU RATCHET THEIR WAY DOWN INTO THAT THAN THAT A CONTRACTION AND THEN YOU MAINTAIN THAT THAT THAT MORE COMFORTABLE LENGTENSION RELATIONSHIP SO WHEN YOU'RE SLEEPING IT ITTENDS TO YOU AIR ON THE SIDE OF SHORTER RATHER LONGER WHEN IDEALLY WE DON'T REALLY WANT THAT WE WANT TO MAINTAIN IS MUCH OF THAT LENGTH BECAUSE WITH MORE LENGTH WE ACTUALLY HAVE MORE LEVERAGE RITE THAT MUSCLE HAS MORE LEVISH TO CONTRACT IF IT WAS ALL THE WAY CONTRACTED YAND YOU REALLY CAN'T OVUS WE KNOW GENERATE MUCH FORCE IN A MUSCLE IT'S ALREADY MACTIONALLY CONTRACTED SO I THINK WE WE WANT E DO SOMETHING TAT WE WHATEVER WE CAN WHATEVER LITTLE WEAPONS WE HAVE AN ARSONAL THAT COULD ALLOW US TO DO THIS PRIOR TO SLEEP AND AGAIN AS JUST MAKING IT A A CONSCIOUS CHOICE TO DO IT A TIME OF THE DAY THAT MAKES THE LO THET MORE SENSE O DYNAMIC STRETCHING IS RALLY NOT DONE FOR TAT PURPOSE OF TRYING TO CREATE ANY TYPE OF OF FEELING OF  ACT OR OR INCREASING THE THE PRETENSIAL LENGTH AS YOU SAID OF THE MUSCLE BUT MORE SO THE READINESS OF THE MUSCLE TO PERFORM AN INCREASING YO EXPLORING THE ENDS OF THAT RANGE OF MOTION IN A MORE DYNAMIC WAYS YOUR NOT HANGING OUT THERE IN DESRUPTING THAT LENGTENTIO RELATIONSHIP WAS JUST SORT OF TOUCHING THE ENDS OF THOSE BARRIERS SO THAT WHEN YOU FEEL MOVEMENT AGAIN IT FEELS LOOSER IT FEELS MORE READY AND T AN OBVOUSLY THE SAME TIME WARMING UP BLOOD FLOW ALL THE BENEFITS WE GET FROM JUST WARMING UP IN GENERAL SO LIKE YO THAT'S THAT'S THE SERIES YOU PROVICING A MUCH OF TIMES BUT LIKE YE LEG SWINGS AND IN YO BUT KICKS IN  O LUNGE  WALKING LUNGH IS AND ALL TYPE TO TOUCH IS TO TOUCH IS ALL THOSE KIND OF DRILLS THOSE ACTIVE STRETCHING DRILLS OR YOU KNOW LUNGING WITH ROTATIONS OFOR THE UPPER BODY TO TRY TO GET SOME OF THE THORASIC FINE INVOLVE TO THOSE OF THE DRILLS THAT PEOPLE WILL DO PRIOR TO TRAINING THAT ARE BOTH EXCITATORY IN TERMS OF JUST THE NERVOUS SYSTEM BUT ALSO HELPFUL FOR JUST THE GENERAL WARM UP THE BODY CAUSE THE BLOOD FLOW BUT FROM MUSCLE READINESS STANDPOINT NOT INPAIRING THE PERFORMANCE WHILE THE SAME TIME EXPLORING THE INCREASED RANGE IS CAUSE ASE YOU KNOW THE FIRST TO TOUCH YOU DO IS NOT TIGE THE LAST TOUCH TOUCH YO ME DOESN'T EVINCLUDE  TO  AN TOUCH DO TOUCH ATTEMPT TRIT I ASSOLYE YOU KOW THOSE THOSE ARE GOING TO IMPROVE WITH EACH SUBSEQUENT WRET AND IVING DOES THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY THAT YOU COAN SEE THOSE THE ACTUAL CHANGES FROM REP ONE DIRECT SEVEN YOU JUST FEEL READY YOU FEEL MORE LURT AND READY TO GO IN YOUR WORK OUT SO THE DYNAMIC TYPE OF STRETCHING A AND I MENTIONED EARLIER ON EUNOLIC WHAT I'VE HAD TO DO THI SORT OF INCREASE MY WARM UP FOCUS YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT'S MORE OF WHAT I TRY TO DO THESE DAYS UH I TRY TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE ALERT TO THE FACT THAT YOURE ABOD Y'S NOT READY HAT WHEN I WAS WHEN I WAS WORKINGWIN ANTONYA BROWN I REMEMBER LIKE HE WOUSD SPEND TWENTY MINUTES THIRTY MINUTES ON ALL DYNAMIC WORK AND I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM BODY SPEND THAT LONG ON THEIR DYNAMIC WORK BUT LIKE HE SAID HE JUST DIDHIM FEEL RIGHT AND READY TO GO UNLESS HE DID A LOT OF THAT AND I MEAN YOU KNOW HIS HIS DYNAMIC STRUTCHING ROUTINE WOULD BE A WORK OUT FOR MOST EVERYBODY YOU KNOW T IT'S CRAZY HO HOW MUCH HE DID THE'S PROAUTLY SER AMAN THING AND A YOU A HAD THE GREAT FORTUNE OF WORKING WITH AND IMPROVING THERE THE'RE ABILITIES UHM BUT I CAN ONLY IMAGINE ACAUSE I'VE ALSO IMENTION HE'S PRETTY STRONG IN THE GENERAL I SO YOU MEAN THYOU KNOW AND SO IT ALWAYS AMAZES ME THE GUIES THAT MAKE IT TO THAT LEVEL NO MATTER WHAT SPORT THEY DO THEY'RE SO GIFTED IN EVERYTHING YOU KNOW LIKE UH THEVID RIGHT USED TO MAKE ME LAUGH ALL THE TIME WITH THE METS BECAUSE  KNO MATTER WHAT I PING PON YOU KNO LIKE ANYTHING HE BECAUSE OF HIS HAND I CORONATION LIKE ANYTHING YOU KNOW GREAT AT JUMP ROPE I REMEMBER HE HADN'T DONE A LOT OF JUMP ROPE AM I I I THINK JUMPRAS FROM THE BEST THINGS YOU COULD DO FROM A CONDITIONING STANDPOINT IT'S ACTUALLY'S FAIRLY INTERESTING IS NOT JUST YOU KNOW U IT'S NOT TO HARSH ON THE JOINTS TEPENDING YOU EVEN THOSIE OF POLISTIC MO ANM HE WASN'T AVT TE MIDIHT YOU KNOW IF YOU LISTENES TO THIS E CAN WHIKE KILLING ABOUT I WI WAS BETTER AT HIM A THAN AT JUMP ROPING WHET THOLY THINGS I COULD DO AND THEN I GAVE HIM ABOUT FIVE DAYS AND HE COMPLETELY BLOOVING OUT THE WATER TO THE MOR I COULD EVER KEEP UP WITH HIM ANY MORE HE MADE IT LOOK EFFORTLESS IT'S LIKE THAT'S THE WORTHY ATHLET AN SOME ONE COMES OUT NO MATTER WHAT THEY PICK UP THEY'RE GOOD AT IT AND I THINK THAT WHEN YOU SEE GOIDES LIKE THIS IN THE JAN LIKE THEYR STRANGT LEVELS TEND TO BE PRETTY DAM GOOD AND THER AND THERE ABILITIES ARE CORINATION THERE THEY'RE EVERYTHING JUST TENDS A SER TO BE GOOD AT THAT LEVEL YOU KNOW NIT SORT OF MADES OF ME WHY THOSE GODES CAN GO PICK OP A GOLF CLUB YOU KNOW I'T GO SHO SEVENTY TOO YOU KNOW AND IN HAVING NEVER LY PLAYED YOU KNOW THEY'RE JUST THE'RE JUST NATURALLY GOOD AT WHATEVER THEY DO YOUI'VE A COUPLE ON I'M SMILING OS ABIT COUBLE REALLY CLOS FRIENDS WHO DID A NUMBER OF YOUR SOME SEVERAL DECATES IN THE SEAL TEAMS AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'R SKILL LEVEL AT EVERYTHING IS SO HIGH AS AS YOU'RE DESCRIBING FOR ATHLETES BUT THEY'RE LEVEL COMPATITIVENESS ON I OCEANS ONE WITH ONE THERE'S NO CHANCE THAT I'M GOING YOU KOW I'T SWIM PAT EVER EVER HE ACTULY GOES BACK AND FORE SOMETIMES JUST  TAK UP HONY AH MUCH I APPRECIATE THANK YOU PAT UM I'M IN DROWN YET BUT HE BUT AN ADITION O THAT YOU KNOW WE COULD LAY HORSE SHOES AND IT'S LIKE THIS SWITCH THAT JUST SCLIPS ON LIKE HE'S GOT A MURDER T VERY NICE  I IN GENERAL THEY TANT BE RAS BUT BUT THE LEVEL COMPATIVENESS LOTHER ER RON RE THER'RS TRY IT FOR THEY'RE TRY TO BET THEMSELVES AND I'M TRY TO BET YOU THAT'S RIGHT O'M NOT EVEN IN THE NIIF THE COMPETITION YOU'RE NOT EVEN THERE I EXACT O THANK YOU NO HEELS IT WERE WORSE UM IT'S TRUE I'S IT'S A REMARKABLE THING I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONE JUMP ROPING  I USED TO SKIPP ROPE FOR WARM UP FOR BOXIN NO AN AS TO WER LIKE WERE THREE THREE MENUTE ROUNDS OR SOMETHINGLIKE THAT I'M BUT I I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT IT UP BECAUSE I'M SKIPPING ROPE IS SOMETHING THAT I OBVIOUSLY HAWS A CARTY OF ASKCULY COMPONENT THERE'S THE CONDITION COMPON THERE'S TIMING AND AND IT IS KIND OF INTERESTING WHY YOU CAN  FRUSTRATING WHEN YOU DON'T GET IT I H WHICH YOU ON THE HER IF YUSING THAT A ROPE IM JUST CURIOUS IF YOU JUST GIVE US A QUICK A SKIPPING ROPE ONE ON ONE YOU LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE JUMPING WITH I'M BOTH FEET AND TELLS WE'LL LINK TO OF ANYOF I'M IF THERE WAS ONE AND I MISSED IT YOU LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE DOING HIN NEESE YOU LIKE PEOPLE ASILY LIKE SHUFFLING I OU WONT SEE PEOPLE DOING DOUBLE DUTCH WHAT YOU WANT ET I DOING OVER TIME ALL OF THE ABOVE MAY BE NOT DOUBLE DUTCH BUT ALL ALL THE ABOVE I MAY I THINK THAT THAT'S THE COOL THING ABOUT IT RIGHT LIKE ONE SWEET SORT OF MASTER THE SKILCAS FOR ALL OF US THAT FIRST JUMP WITH THE TWO FEET GOING TOGETHER IS A CHALLENGE CAUSE YOU JUST GOT TIME THAT ROPE YON GOT TIME YOU JUMP AND THEN WE GET BOARD AS WE OFTEN DO AS HUMANS WE GET BOARD WHAT WE CAN DO IN ONE TO TAKE ON NEW CHALLENGES SO THEN IT BECOMES ONE LIKE AT TA TIME OR THAN IT BECOMES SIDE TO SIDE HOPS RIGHT IN ALL THOSE THINGS ARE BENEFICIAL I BELIEVE NARLOGICALLY TO ENHANCING THE ABILIT TO DO THE SKILL AS A HOLE BUT ALSO JUST BECAUSE I'M I'M SUCH A BELIEVER AND TRAINING IN ALL THREE PLAINS SO LIKE JUST DOING STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN FIRST AS NOW I CAN YOU FRONT OF PLANE SIDE OSIDE MOTION AND THE I CAN EVEN DO SMALL LITTLE TWISTS OR CORKSCREWS YOEU CALL EM IM IT REQUIRES AT DIFFE YOU NO MORE BE BETTER THAN I DO THERE IT REQUIRES DIFFERENT NARLOGICAL HATTERNS TO BE ALL E A COORDINATE THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE CHANGING THE ORANTATION OF YOUR BODY IN SPACE SO IT'S NOT JUST THI'M CHANGING THE EXERCIDE FOM CHANGING HOW MY BODY IN TERPRET THAT EXERCISE BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENED TO MY BODY INS FACE SO I I LOVE YOU KNOW WHATEVER PEOPLE LIND UP DOING BUT I'M I'M AMAZED THERE ARE PEOPLE I JUST ARE TO FALL IN THIS YOUNG WOMAN ON HIS TER GRAHAM WHO IS LIKE A I'VIL GIVE HER PLUG OUT OF THIS I ANN A SKIPS OR SOMETHING AND SEE IS RIDICULOUS LIKE THAT I LOGER N LIKE MESMERIZE HAT WHAT SHE CAN DO WITH THE ROPE YOU KNOW IT  IT'S LIKE ISN'T EXTREMELY ATHLETIC ENDEAVOR BELIEVE WHEN IT GETS TO BE AT THAT LEVEL IN THE SPEED IN THE PRECISION IN THE YO IN IN YOU KNOW I THINK ONE OF THE GOALLS THIT YOU WANT TO BE ALE TO HAVE IS TO WHERE YOU'R FEELING AS IF YOUERE ALMOST EFFORTLESSLY DANCING WITHOUT A ROPE LIKE WHERE YOU'RE JUST BOUNCING OFF O THE BALL OF YOUR FOOT I'M AN IT'S AN IMPORTANT SKILL TO LEARN TO WHETHER YOU GO BACK TO RUN OR YOU KNOW OR EVEN EVEN JAG RIGHT JUST LIKE YOU MORE CASUAL RUNNING LEARNING HOW TO LAND IS SO IMPORTANT ONE THE DRILLS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD TRY IS LIKE TRO TO JUMP ON YOUR HEELS SO JUST STAND UP PULL YOUR TOES OFF THE GROUND RIGHT AN JUST JUMP FROM YOUR HEELS AND LAND ON YOUR HEELS YOU'LL FEEL IT IN YOUR JAW YOU'LL DOLY FEEL YOUR JAW RATTLE WHEN YOU LAND ON YOUR HEELS THERE IS NO SHOCK ABSORPTION CAPABILITIES THROUGH YOUR HEELS MEANTIME A LOT OF PEOPLE LAND ON THEIR HEELS A LOT WHEN THEY WHEN THEY RUN AND YOU'RE JUST YOUR BODY'S NOT BUILT TO ABSORB THE FORCES LIKE THE BALL OF YOUR FOOT COULD IS REALLY BUILT AS A SPRING AN IN THE FOOT IS A TO ME AS THE PHYSICAL THERIPIS THE FOOT IS ALWAYS BEING ON F THE MOST MAKE AV YOU TING I HAVENA BAD FEET I HAVE FLAT FEET IT LOOS LIKE I GOT FLIPPERS IF I TOOK MY IF I TOOK MY SHOES OFF LIKE THAT I L A A WAREN SCUPIFFENCE THERE IS NO THERE IS NO ADAPTABILITY OF THAT FOOT TO THE SURFACE ONLY WHEN IT'S COMPLETELY CAVE THAN FLATTAN LIKE THAT THE JOB OF HI OF THE FOOT IS TO BE ADAPTABLE LE THERE IS MAYBE THERE IS SOME ADAPTABILITY T CU SO FLOPPY BUT AT THE SAME TIME AT SOME POINT THAT CRITICAL JUNCTION WHEN YOU'RE G THEN STEP THROUGH AND YOU NEED TO BUILD A PUSH OFF THE FOOT HAS TO ACTUALLY CHANGES IN THE MID FOOT ITSELF TO BECOM A RIGID LEVERS OF THEY CALL IT YOU YOU'RE GOING FROM A MOBILE ADAPTOR TO A RIGID LEVER THAT RIGID LEVER LITRALLY LOCKS UP MITARSEL JOINT TO BECOME SOLID SO THAT YOU CAN PUSH OFF IT WITH LEVERAGE IF YOU LACK THAT CAPABILITY ALL THOSE STRESSES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE BORN BY THE FOOT GO UP INTO THE ANKLE INTO THE KNEE INTO THE HIP INTO THE LOW BACK SO HE LEARNING HOW TO LAND IN IN START TO TRAIN YOUR YOUR BODY TO A TO A EXPERIENCE GROUND REACTION FORCES THE RIGHT WAY IS SO CRITICAL TO ALL OTHER FUNCTION IN ALL HER DISABILITY UP THE CANNACHAIN AND JUMPING ROPE IS LIKE ONE O THE BEST WAYS TO LEARN HOW O DO THAT GREAT I I OWN A JUMP ROPE I' LOVE DOING IT IN THE MORNING WHILE I GET SUNLIGHT IN MY EYES IT'S A SHE A A PROTO CALLI PICKED UP FROM TIM PHARIS MENTION AS LISTENRS O MY POKCASTING OM LIKE A BROKEN RECORD WOULD GET SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES EVEN THROUGH CLOUD COVER ITS JUST SETS YOUR SLEEP RHYTHMS IN YOUR WAKING RESMS A YOT ATA ON AND ON OM BUT TOM AS THEY BE KIND OF WARRING FOR PEOPLE AND I WANT TO GET THEM OFF THEIR PHONE SO JUMPING ROPES ALSO DISAGREAT WHEN WINK UP TO A JUMPING ROPE CAN BE A THE CARDIO WORK OUT THE FIFTEEN YOUR THIRTY MENUT I THEREN THERE'S NO THAT HIBRA THAT WERE TOING BY BEFORE F LIKE NO YOUR NOT YOU'RE NOT NECESSARILY DROPPING DOWN OF THE GROUND DOING BERPES BUT I JUST LOOK AT IT AS A MORE ATHLETIC ENDEAVER BECAUSE OF THE CORDINATION INVOLVE THAN JUST SIMPLY WALKING OR A JOGGING AND YOU IT'S NOT MUCH OF A A EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENT THE VERY MEN  MAN COST AND ID EVEN USE A ROPE OR OR SOMETHING IF YOU ALTHOUGH WE WEVEN INSTRUCTUBLE THAT YOU USE NO ROPE ND JIST PRETEND I KNOW IT JUST EMOVE THE ARMS   TRUELY R ANT NEVER GET A HIT THE ROPE WHICH IS GOOD BUT YOU KNOW IT THE SAME TO SAY NEVERYNG YOU KNOW IF YOU DOING IT WRONG BUT LESS YOU CAN YOU CAN MOVE THROUGH AND GET THE SAME BENEFITS TOU THE FEET ALOV IT ALOV IT AM I TOLD MYSELF BEFORE SITTING DOWN WITH YOU TO DAY THAT I WASN'T GOING TO FOCUSS ON SPECIFIC EXERCISES BECAUSE THERE'S SUCH A WEALTH OF INCREDIBLE CONTENT YOU PUT OUT THERE THAT PEOPLE COULD JUST PUT IN TO YOU TO BOR ELSEWHERE AND AND ARRIVE AT THE PROPER WAY TO DO A CHIN OR A DIPOR A FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE BUT THERE'S ONE EXERCISE IN ONE PARTICULAR MOTION THAT I'D LIKE TO A DISCUST FOR A MOMENT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT LEARNING ABOUT THIS CAUTIONARY NOTE FROM YOU IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I'VE MAINTAINED STEADY TRAINING FOR THIRTY YEARS W NO MAJOR INJURY  KNOCK GON WOOD UM AND THAT'S THE UPRIGHT ROW UM YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT WHETHER NOT BE WEIGHT TRAIN OR NOT I SECT OF THIS PODCAST AND SENSER AND WE BEAP THIS OUT AN I I DOU YOU GET BEEF ABOUTNI I O YOU KNOW WHAT I WE ALWAYS GET BEEFIN A SOCIA IMMEDIATE PLATFORM EREVER PUT OUT BY LIKE NOW I GETS TOM I GET SOME FROM IT BUT IM IM LA I'M FULLY PREPARED TO DEFEND MYSELF SO THE BUT HERE HERE'S THE REASON FOR ASKINGABOUT THIS I NEVER REALLY CARED MUCH FOR UPRIGHT ROWS IT'S NOT AN EXERCISE I TENDED YOU BUT A ONE THING THAT'S APPARENT IN ALL MY COLLEAGUES IN EVERY CHILD I SEE IN EVERY ADULT I SEE IS THAT ALMOST EVERYBODY IS AN INWARD TO ROTATION NOW UM SO FOLKS THINK OU IF YOU STAY I THINK I LEARN THIS FROM YOU ALL SO IF YOU STAND UP STRAIGHTENING JUST POINT YOUR THUMBS OUT UM LIKE A LIKE A THUMBS OUT BUT YOU'RE JUST POINT YOUR HANDS ARE DOWN YOUR POINT YOURE THUMB STRAIGHT OUT I DEALLY THE WOULD GO STRAIGHT OUT MOST PEOPLE THE THUMBS ING ME POINTING TOWARD ONE AOTHER DIS MOST PEOPLE AR STARTING TO LOOK SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A A I NON UM HUMAN PRIMATE UM AND A MELTED CANDLE IM T YOU KNOW BHEN TO THE HIPS ET CETERA FROM TOO MUCH SITTING WE'RE ALL SITTING WHERE AN INWARD ROTATION BUT I LEARNE FROM YOU THAT THE UPRIGHT ROAD COMPROMISES AT SOME IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF OUR SHOULDER A MECHANICS AN CAN BE ASH SORT OF DANGEROUS MOVEMENT IN SOME WAYS I'M SURE THERE'S A SAFE WAY FOR PEOPLE TO DO IT BUT SO I'VE ALWAYS MADE IT A POINT NOW ON THE BASIS OF OF THIS ADVICE TO A NOT DO UPRIGHT ROWS BUT I WASN'T DOING THEM BEFORE BUT TO REALLY STRIVE FOR AM EXTERNAL ROTATION ON THINKS LIKE BENCH DIPS ON ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS WHENEVER I CAN I TRYIND GOING TO EXTERNAL ROTATION AND PRIVE YOUND WITHOUT LOOKING LIKE AN IDIOT WALK AROUND MY PALMS FACING NOUTWARD PLEASE TELL US ABOUT INTERNAL EXTERNAL ROTATION IM THE UPRIGHT ROW IS ONE ASPECT OF TAT BUT WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTT NOT JUST FOR WEIGHT TRAINING BUT AS IT TERMS OF POSTURE AND MECHANICSAND AND NOT LOOKING LIKE A A MELTED CANDLE OR PARTIALLY MELTA CANDLE IM ACTUALLY LOVE I I I'M HAPPY IT OLK BAGS I LOVE I LOVE THE SHOULDER AS A JOYT I THINK PITYS TEND O FALLIN LOVE A CERTAIN AREAS IN THE SHOULDERS ONE OF THE COOL ARIES FOR ME HES LIKE THE FOOT IS BUT LIKE THE SHOULDER HAS THE MOST MOBILITY IN THE BODY OF ANY OF ANY JOIN BUT IT'S ALSO GOT THE LEASTSTABILITY FOR THERE'S ALWAYS THAT TRADE OFF OF MOBILITY IN STABILITY SO YOUR STABILITY COMES FROM YOU KNOW CERTAIN MUSTLE GROUPS AND WHELE THE ONES THAT THE ONLY MUSTLE GROUP THAT ACTUALLY EXTERNALLY ROTATE THE SHOULDERS CAN BE THE ROTATOR CUFF OKE AND UNLESS YOU'RE DEVOTED TO TRAINING THROUGH EXTERNAL ROTATION IN EXERCISES THAT OUR GOING TO EXTRALY ROTATE THE SHOULDER YOU'RE NOT TRAINING THAT FUNCTION AND IT'S SO EASY FOR US IN EVERYDAY LIFE ESPECIALY THOSE THAT AREN'T TRAINING TO NOT EVER REALLY UNDERGO ANY OF THOSE TRESSES THAT COULD BE BENEFICIAL TO CANTERACTING WHAT HAPPENS FREELY AND NATURALLY WHICH IS INTERROTATION SO WL YOU THINK ABOUT THE EMBALANCE CREATED JUST BY NATURE AND HOW WE LIVE OUR LIVES INTERNROTATION FAR FAR FAR OUTWAYS EXTERN ROTATION SO YOU NEED TO ADDRESS IT AND THE REASON WHY YOU NEED YOU ADDRESS IS BECAUSE YOU NEED TO NORMAL LIVES THOSE BYO MECHANICS TO THE SHOULDER IF YOU WANT THEIR LONG TERM HELT AND ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SHOULDERS TO RAISE OUR ARM UP OVER OUR HEAD AND WIF WE DO THAT FROM AN INTERLY ROTATED POSITION WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF CREATING STRESS INSIDE THAT JOINT FUNNY THING IS I TALKED ABOUT BEFORE MY MY PT BRETHREN CAN BE SOMEWHAT AAA ANGRY THESE DAYS ALL NO WHAT HAPPEN BUT FOR THE ANGRY YOU KNOW THEY WANT THEY WANT A DISCREDIT THE EXISTENCE OF SOMETHING LIKE A SHOULDER IN PINGEMENT WHICH I DON'T KNOW HOW I M CERTAIN STUDIED WE BOTH WE ALL READ STUDIES THAN WE WE STUDIES WILL SAY ONE THING ONE DAY POTENTIALLY CONFLICT ENTIRELY IN A DIFFEREN DIRECTION SOME STUDIES WILL POINT TO THE NON EXISTENCE OFAOF A SHOULDER IN PINGEMENT MEANWHILE WE HAVE THANKFULLY A DIGINAL MOTION EX RAIS THAT WILL LITERALLY SHOW THE IMPINGEMENT OCCUR IN REAL TIME IN REAL FUNCTION AND AS ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS THEM OFF ON A TANGENT HERE BUT LIKE THOSE TYPES OF EX RAGE OF THAT TYPE OF FLOROSCOBY THAT WE HAVE NOWADAYS LIKE GIVES US SUCH INSIGHT THAT WE NEVER HAVE BEFORK AS WE'RE TAKING STATIC EX RAYS OF SOME ONE LYING DOWN ON A TABLE YOU KNOW WHEN I WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE ACTUALLY RAISE MY ARM UP OVER MY HEAD IN FUNCTION AND THEY IN THE TOOLS NOW EXISTEND DO THAT WE SEE THAT THAT THE PROBLEMS OCCURRING BECAUSE IN ORDER TO GET NORMAL MECHANICS IN FREE UP THE JOINT MAXIMALLY INSIDE YOU NEED TO EXTERING ROTA AS YOU RAISE THE ARM UP SO IF YOUR MUSCLES AREN'T FIRING IN THEI'RE NOT NECESSARILY O AS STRONG AS THE INTERN ROTATION BY US THAT PULLS THEM IN YOU'RE ALSCANG FOR TROUBLE EVERY TIME YOU DO THAT WULL THIS EXERCISE IS LITERALLY PUTTING YOU IN ELEVATION AN INTERNROTATION AND IF YOU WERE TO WALK INTO A PT OFFICE AND SOME ONE SAID I THINK HE'S GOT IN PINGEMENT WILL YOU DIAGNOSE HIM THERE'S A TEST CAUSE A HAWKIN'S KENNEDY TESTS AND I WOULD PUT YOU IN THE POSITION I KNOW WE'RE NOT VISIBLE O THIS POINT THROUGH THE POGCAST BUT I'LL PUT YOU IN THIS POSITION HERE WHERE I HAVE YOUR ARM ELEVATED AND YOUR HAND PRETTY MUCH UNDER YOUR CHIN PUSHING DOWN WARD ON THAT TO CREATE THAT ITERNAL SHOULDER ROTATION PRETTY MUCH THE EXACT POSITION THAT WERE IN WHENE WE'RE HOLDING A BAR IN IN AN UPRIGHT ROW SOME WILL SAY AWLE JUST DON'T GO SO HIGH GOONLY UP TO THE LEVEL OF THE CHEST BUT YOU'RE STILL IN THIS INTERLY ROTATED POSITION THE THE THING THAT I THINK FRUSTRATES ME THE MOST ABOUT THE EXERCISE AS THAT I HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE AND THE ALTERNATIVE DOES THE SAME THING IN TERNS OF HELPING THE MUSCLES GROW BY SIMPLY FIXING THE BY MECHANICS OF THE EXERCISE BUT JUST ALLOWING THE HANDS TO GO HIGHER THAN THE ELBOWS SOINSTEAD OF THE ELBOWS BEING HIGHER THAN THE HAND WHICH DRIVES YOU IN TOE INTERROTATION IF THE ELBOW IS LOWER THAN THE HAND THE HAND BEING HIGHER HERE I'M AN EXTERN ROTATION ND I COULD DO SOMETHING CALLED A HIGH PULL AND STILL GET THE SAME ABDUNCTION OF THE ARM AND STILL GET THE SAME BENEFITS OF THE SHOULDERS THA DELTS IN THE TRAPS WITHOUT HAVING TO UNDERGO ANY OF THE STRESSES THAT WOULD COME FROM THE SOMEWHAT AWKWARD MOVEMENT OF AN UPRIGHT ROW AND FOR THOSE LISTENING I WILL PUT A LINK TO A SHORT CLIP OF WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE BUT BASINGLY WHAT JEFF IS DOING AND TELL ME IF I'M DESCRIBING AS A INCORRECTLYER CORRECTLY JEFF AS A TAKING YOUR TWO THUMBS AND POINTING BEHIND YOU AND I RIGT AND YON SI ELWAYS UP KIND OF NEAR THE CHIN AND APOINTING BEHIND YOU LIKE GO AHEADED THAT WAY LIKE SOMEBODY DIRECTING THE AIR PLAYING LIKE  Y ASK EM BACK WHAR ACK E A I FEEL WHAT THEY CALL THAT I THINK IT'S CALLED SOME OFOREIGN IS THE ACTION OF LIKE WHERE THEY DIRECT THE PLANS I SOM THE THE FLAGS OR WHATEVER SOMEONE OF COURSE TELL ME I'M WRONG ABOUT THAT TO WHICH IS WHY I SAY THESE THINGS BECAUSE I LIKE I LIKE BEING TOLD WHAT THET WHAT THE CORRECT ANSWER IS A IN ANY CASE ASO THIS REPLACES THAT THE UPRIGHT ROW AND AN PRO DOEST NUMBER OF OTHER IMPORTANT THINGS S WELL YET WALL IT AGAIN U THIS TO NIGHT I WEN WITHOUT NAMING NAMES OR PROGRAMMES INGA THAT WHEN I GOT INVOLVED AND ND WHENI GOT INVOLVED IN IN A AFTLY NEXT TI FIRST STARTED OO A MON LINE I  PRESENCE THERE WAS A VERY VERY VERY POPULAR A PROGRAMME THAT WAS OUT THERE THAT I JUST FOR FUN I WANTED A HAS A PTINTHE E NURTYD THINGS WE DO BUT I WANTED A VALUE WEIGHT THE THE WORK OUT STRUCTURE AND I WENT AND I LOOKED AT EVERY REP OVER A COURSE OF A WEEK AND THERE ARE SOMETHING LIKE YOU KNOW EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINETY REPETITIONS ARE SOMETHING DONE A AND ZERO OF THEM WERE DEDICATED EXTON ROTATIONIN THE SHOULDER SO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT ME GET IT WAS HO VERY POPULAR PROGRAM THAT WAS DONE BY A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE IS NO THERE WAS NO FOCUS AT ALL NO TDEDICATED FOCUS TOWARDS CREATING A BALANCE TO AN ACTION THAT IS SO PREDOMINANTNT REMEMBER IS NOT  JUST BECAUSE WE SIT WITH THAT POSTURE BUT THE FACT THAT ARE CHESS CAN INTERNALLY ROTEY AR LAST CAN ENTOA ROTA THERE'S LIKE MUSCLE OTHER BIG MUSCLES THAT PARTICIPATE IN THINGS THAT WE DO EVERY DAY THAT WILL FURTHER ENTILLY ROTATE THE SHOULDER THE ONLY WEAPONS WE HAVE FOR EXTON ROTATION ARE THOSE LITTLE ROTITICUFF MUSCLES AND THREE OF THEM ACTUALLY THREE OF THE FORE AND THE JOB IS TI SORT OF ACTIVELY AND CONSCIOUSLY TRAIN THEM TO REALLY THE BORING EXERCISE IS RIGHT LIKE YOU'VE SEEN THEM WITH THE BAND YUYOU YOU ANCHOR A BAND TO A POLL YOU STAND WITH THE BAND IN TE OPPOSITE HAND SO FITS ANCHORE TO THE POLE MY LEFT SIDE I'V GOT THE BAND OF MY RIGHT SIDE YOU SEE PEOPLE WHERE THEY CAN A ROTATE THEIR HAND TOWARDS THE BACK AGANKIND WYOUARE SAYING BUT AT A LOWER ELEVATION TAKING THE BACK OF MY HAND TO TRY N TO POINT IT TO SOMEBY BEHIND ME A WELL YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS THAT IT IS ONE THE WAYS TO TRAIN THE MUSCLETS IT IS JUST OF ONE FUNCTION OF THE SHOULDER EXTERNAL ROTATION OF THE SHOULDER AND YOU NEED TO DO IT AND AGAIN IT'S NOT THAT IF SOMEBODY WAS DOING MORE EXTRN ROTATION WORK COULD THEY ABSORBE THE UPRIGHT ROW BETTER PROBABLY BECAUSE AS THEY ELEVATED THE ARM THEY PROBABLY HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A CONTRIBUTION FROM THE ROTEDER CUFF THAT TO WHAT ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS IS THE CENTRA LIVES THE HEAD OF THE HUMOROUS INSIDE OF THE GLENOI THE OF THE CAPSIL SO AS IT RISEES UP IT STAYS CENTRAL AS A POST OF MIGRATING UP A BECAUSE THE DELTOY LIKES TO PULL UP SO IF THE ROTITI CUFF HAS SOME ABILITY TO CANTERA CT THE UPWARD PULL OF THE DELL THEN IT CAN MAINTAIN A MORE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP WITH OVER HEBOITSO JUST REALIZING THAT THAT THAT THAT FUNCTION'S ONLY GAME THROUGH DOING THESE EXERCISES IM YOU KNOW WE WE WOULD PRIVATE DEDI KEEP MORE TIME THERE BUT THE RO TIT THE UPRIGHT ROW MIGHT BE BETTER ABSORBED BY THAT PERSON CAUS THEY HAVE A WITH MORE STRAINGTH BUT AGAIN WHY BECAUSE IF YOU HAVENAT EXERCISE THAT DOES THE SAME THAME FOR WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO MUSCULARLY TO BUILD THE MUSCLES THAT IT EFFECTS WHY WON'T YOU JUS DO IT WHERE YOU CAN STILL SEE EXTN ACTUALLY PICK UP MORE REPETITIONS OF EXTERN ROTATION YOU NES SE YOU'R GETTING NONE OF THE HARM ALL THE BENEFITS I SEE ZERO REASON TO EVER DO THE UPRIGHT ROW THE PEOPLE WILL ARGUE THIRE'S THE WAY THEY ARGUE THAT I'VE DONE THIS FOR THIRTY YEARS AND I'VE NEVER HUART MYSELF AND I ALWAYS SAY YET YET LIKE I LISTEN THE GOLDESS DID NOT HURT YOURSELF EVER SO EVEN IF YOU ITS SORT OF LIKE YOU KNOW THE CHIMPIONSHIP GAME YOU KNW YOU MIGHT PLAY THE GAME OF YOUR LIFE BUT IF YOU LOSE YOU' LOST AND WHEN YOU GET INTO THE END OF TEOTHER THE RECORD BOOKS YOURE TILL LOST SO EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE GAME YOUR LIFE YOU LOST I DON'T CAREIF YOU DO I FOR THIRTY YEARS NO PAIN IS STILL DOING IT IN THERE'S NO PAIN I'M GIVING YOU AN OPTION THAT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU THE SAME RESULTS AN THE EXERCISE AT YOUR SEEKING THAT'S WHY YOU'RE DOING THE EXERCISE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING THTHE THE BAD OUTCOME COME FROM IT SO YOU KNOW I GET OL TAT YOU DEFENSIVE OOTE THE MOVEMENT I FEEL LIKE IT'S LIKE WHY WOULD TO DO THAT YOU KNOW NOW IT MAKES IT MAKES US BEING ABLE TO TRAIN FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND FEEL GOOD YOU KNOW I A PROUD TO SAY YOU KNW AND I DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF YOUN EXCELLIC WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF IMPRESSIVE ATHLETES IN OUR FAMILY TREEER AND THEN THERE YOU OY SOM FIT INDIVIDUAL SOME LESS FIT INDIVIDUALS BUT I REALLY BELIVE I'S OP PUTTING IN THE WORK CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME AND THE THE MORE THE MORE OFTEN YOU CAN WAKE UP NOT IN PAIN THE BETTER IM AND SO YOU KNOW THI THINK THAT BEING AN EXTERNAL ROTATION AS OFFENAST POSSIBLES GOOD THIS ACTUALLY A GOOD FRIEND WHO'S A YOGA TEACHER TOLD ME THIS ALSO PROBLEM WITH THE YOGIES YOU KNOW LOT ALL THE DOWNWARD DOGS UP FOR THOSE LISTENING A YOUCAN THINK OF INWARD ROTATION AS LIKE THUMBS DOWN JUST THINK IT THUMS DOWN ANMRTATION ISN'T BAD BUT LESS THUMBS DOWN WORE THUMBS UP TI EXTERNAL ROTATION SO FOR FOR THOSE JUST LISTENING MAYBE THEY GIVES A O VISUAL THE MORE EXERCISE YOU CAN DO IN EXTERNAL ROTATION O THE BETTER IT SEEMS ON AVERAGE IM I'D LOVE TO CHAT WITH YOU JUST O A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT BO MECHANICS IM AND I AND THIS IS A PERSONAL THING THAT I THAT AGAIN YOUR CONTECT REALLY HELP SALL FOR ME ONE IS I THOUGHT I HAD LOWER BACK PAIN OT I HAD SIATIC A SO BADLY THAT ON A FEW TRIPS I A WORK TRIPS YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS DOING WOT MORE IN ERNATIONAL TRAVEL I MEAN S HARD TO STAND UP SOMETIME ON YOU LIK EXCRUCIATING PAIN I DON'T WANT TO TAKE MEDICATION IA WANT YOU BACK SURGERY UM IN THE END TURNS OUT IT WASN'T A BACK INJURY AT ALL IM AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HELP FIX IT WAS THIS JUST LEARNING ABOUT THIS THING CALLED THE MEDIAL GLUE AND YOU I AT OF VIDIO IT'S SAID FIX BACK PAIN AND THEN YOU UM QUITE ACTUALLY SEE THAT SOME BACK PAIN ISN'T REALLY ABOUT THE BACK AT ALL AND AM AND HAVE ME DO AN EXERCISE WHER ALLOWED ME TO TRY AN EXERCISE WHERE I I LAY ON MY SIDE AN SUCH SHOUL POINTING MY UM MY TOE DOWN THE TOP TOE DOWN ALMOST LIKE POINTING TOE DOWN AND THEND WOULD SLOWLY LIFT THE THE LAK UP WHILE POINTING THE TOE DOWN I MAYBE I GOT IT E RAGER THEND EN HOLDING THAT AND THERE'S A THERE'S A MUSCLE THAT SURESITS AT THE TOP OF THE GLUTE CIND OF PEAKS OUT EVERYONE SIN A WHILE YOU CAN FEEL IT THERE WITH YOUR THUMB WHICH IS I THINK IT YOU HAD PUSH BACK ON IT A A BIT CRAING THAT MIND MUSCLE LINK AGAIN AND AND THERE WITH PROPERECEPTION THE ACTUAL FEELING OF A MUSCLE LITERALLY WITH IT WITH A LIM WE KNOW FOR THE BASED ON THE NORAL CIRCUITS FOR MOVEMENT THAT THAT ENHANCEIS THE CONTRACTILE ABILITY OF MUSCLE SO LIKE IF YOU TOUCH YOUR BYCE AP YOU YOU LITERALLY CAN CONTRACT IT MORE  MORE STRONGLY IN THIS MAKES TOTAL SENSE BASED ON UM A NORL MUSCULAR PHYSIOLOGY SO HAVE ME DO THAT REPEATEDLY ATS'ST OUR DOING THAT IN MY HOTEL ROOM AND THE PAIN STARTED TO DISAPPEAR AND THEN IT CAME BACK AGAIN THE AFTERNOON SO I DID IT AGAIN IN THE AFTERSO THIS IS SOMETHING I DID FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS AND LONE BEHOLD A BACKPAINS GONE I HANDED THIS OFF TO MY FATHER BECAUSE HE LIKE ME HAS A SLIGHTLY LOWER RIGHT SHOULDER I THINK THAT OUR GATE IS PROBBLY THROWN OFF BY THIS IS PRIGAN AT I INNER WHO KNOWS HE HANDED OFF TO SOMEBODY YOUNOW IT TURNS OUT THAT WE DON'T SUFFER FROM BACKPAIN AND IF AC NOW I DON'T SO FROMRANYPHING BECAUSE I I WAS DOING THIS EXERCISE WHICH I THINK IS HELPING MY LOW AN MY MEDIAL GLUTETWO REASONS WHY RAISE THIS ONE AN  LOTTY EYES HAVE THE RIGHT SIDE SIATICA CAN PEOPLE TO KEEP THE WALL AT THEIRIS ONE IDEA WERE LEFT IDE SATIC A  THERE'RE A LOT OF PEOPLE MALE AND FEMALE WHO THINK THEY HAVE BACK PAIN WHEN THEY DON'T ACH HE AT BACK PAIN AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT IS ABOUT A GENERAL QUESTION ABOUT MY MECHANICS OR STEAMIN ABOUT MY  MACCANS I HAD OF A FEELING THAT A LOT OF WHAT PEOPLE THNK IS BACK PAINT ER KNEAN PAIN OR NECKPAIN OR HEAD ACH FOLER MIN IS ACTUALLY A THE CONSEQUENCE OF SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENING ABOVE OR BELOW THAT SIGHT OF PAIN I AND UM THIS IS A WHOLE LANDSCAPE OF OF STUFF RELAY TO PT AN  ND AND RECOVERY AN AND PAIN MANAGEMENT BUT MAYBE YOU JUST A EDUCATE US A BIT ON THIS AND WHY THIS WORKS WHAT IS THE MEDIAL GLUE WHY DID IT MAKE MY SO CALLED BACK PAIN DISAPPEAR AND UM HOW SHOULD PEOPLE THINK ABOUT PAIN AND I LIKE USES A SADWAY TO GET INTO BUT DEEPER DISCUSSION ABOUT PAIN AND RECOVERY SURE SO THE THER THIS IS DEFININ LIKE  A I BIG CORNICOPIA PT STUFF HERE BUT LIKE I AND THI'S MY LOVE SO FIRST OF ALL THAT VIDIA THATIS IT IT'S MY PROUDEST VIDIAL TH I HAVE AN THE REASON BEING IS THAT I IS HELPED SO MANY PEOPLE LIKE WE WE GET CO THE COMMENTS ON AVIO EVERY DAY A I DON'T KNOW M IF YOU'S GOT NOWN THIRTY SOM MY MILLION OR IS THER  OU WILL LINK TO IT THE OTHERS  OONUS AND IN WHY SLY WAS A IT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF AN AFTER THOUGHT VEDAL IN TERMS OF THIS ITS A IT'S ORIGIN I THINK THAT THAT THEY MAYBE JESTE WA S HAVING SOME PROBLEMS OR SOMETHING THOWN LE BETALOW BACK PAIN AND AND I SHOWED IM AND IT HELP RIGHT AWAY ONS LIKL O WE CAN MAKE OF IT LON IT CAUSE THIT'S THIS WILL HELP PEOPLE UNO NOT NOT EVERYBODY YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A REAL THIS PROBLEMS IKE ON TO HELP YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOUR NOT CHANGING THE STRUCTURAL PROBLEM THAT'S THERE BUT AS YOU SAID LOT PEOPLE DON'T NO AND AND EVEN DISCIS YOUS E OM A LOT OF M  NOT OPERATIVE SO YOU'D WANT TO TRY THESE THINGS FIRST A AS FAR AS WHAT YOU SORT OF EXPERIENCE SOMETIMES HAS THAT GLUPE MEDIOUS RELY TIGHTENS DOWN IN THAT SATS AGAIN FROM POR BY MECHANICS UP AND DOWN THE CANNANT CHAIN IT CAN ACTUALLY PRESS ON THE SIADIC NERVE AND GIVE YOU WHAT THEY CAUS SUITOSIATICA NE AWARE IT IT I YOUR NI LIKE YOUR YOU'RE MAKING IT UP IT'S N'T LIKE YOUR NOT FEELING THAT PAIN OVER THAT SAME SIIC DISTRIBUTION BUT IT'S NOT CAUSE FROM A DISK IS NOT CAUSE FROM SOMETHING MECHANICAL THERE IT'S CAUSED BY THE FACT THAT THIS GLU MEDIOUS HAS HAS POSTURELY TO BECOME A PROBLEM FOR YOU OR WEAK YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU DON'T TRAIN IT AND YOU NEED TO ADDRESS IT SO  LIKE UNLIKE NOT UNLIKE ANY OTHER MUSCLE IN THE BODY THERE ARE COMMON TRIGGER POINTS IN COMMON AREAS WHERE THE MUSCLE WILL BECOME TIGHTENED OR PAINFUL OR SPASM AND YOU CAN BASICALLY APPLY PRESSURE TO THESE AREAS TO AND THEN SORT OF THREAD THAT MUSCLE THROUGH THE PRESSURE BY PUSHING DOWN THROUGH THERE AND THEN CONTRACTING THE MUSCLE WHICH IS WHY YOU GO THROUGH THAT ACTION OF Y WE I THNG WE CALL A TOTTABBER BUT LIKE STABBING DOWN AND LIFTHING UP AS TABIN DOWN ON TIT THE TAKING THAT THAT GLUE MEDIUS THROUGH ITS FUNCTION SO THATS BASICALLY KIND OF WORKING UNDERNEATH THE DOWNWARD PRESSURE OF THE FINGER AND THAT TENDS TO HELP YOU TO ALMOST YOU KNOW A NEED OUT WHAT MIGHT BE THE THAT TRIGGER POINT AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE CAN SEE IMMEDIATE RELIEF THERE BECAUSE ONCE THE TRIGGER POINT LET'S GO A IT FEELS LIKE AND THAT'S THE GOOD THE COMMENTS ARE IN THAT VITIA LIKE MY GOT I THUT I COULDN'T WALK I'VE NOT MY HO TEL FLOOR I DID THIS AND WN FIXED AND MEANWHILE THEN YOU KNOW IT COULD COME BACK BECAUSE YOUR BODY IS LIKE WHA I LIKE BEING MORE LIKE THIS IS IS HOW I'E BEEN NOIN A ENGRAIN TO BE SO MIGHT COME BACK WITH THEM WHEN YOU DO ANOTHER ROUND OF IT AN ANOTHER ROUND OF IT AND THEN FINALLY ASTESSISARA I'M NOT GING TO ANY MORE CONT EASES UP THAN YOU CAN RELIEVE YOURSELF OF THOSE OF THOSE TRIGGER POINTS YOU DO THAT UP AND DOWN THE BACK THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE THAT GET THAT IN THAT SORT OF INSIDE THEIR SHOULDER BLADE YOU KNOW AT THAT SAME TYPE OF CRAMPING IN ANOTHER AREA A BUT HONCE THAT TAKES PLACE WILL THEN THE JOB THAT I THINK PEOPLE HAVE IS LIKE BECOME EDUCATED THAT YOF THE GLUTE MEDIUS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE GLUE MAXIMUS OU LIKE THEIR FUNCTIONS ARE ARE DIFFERENT YEN YOU HALF TO WORK ON NOT JUST EXTENDING THE HIP BUT ALL SO ABDUCTION OF THE HIP EC TO ROTATION OF THE HIP SAME THING ISN'N IN THE SHOULDER AND THIS ACTUALY SAID WAYS NICELY INTO WHAT INTO THE WHOLE CONCERTUR TOG ABALIC THE BODY IS LIKE A MIRROR IMAGE THE HIP IS LIKE THE SHOULDER RIGHT THE ANKLE IS THE WRIST THE FOOT IS THE HAND LIKE THE THAT THEY FUNK THENEE IS THE ELBOWS THER TWO HINCE JOINS THEY FUNCTION THAT WAY WELL WITH THE SHOULDER YOU'VE GOT THAT MOBILITY THAT COMES FROM HAVING ALL THAT FREEDOM OF MOTION BUT THE STABILITY IS LACKING WELL THE SAMETHING WITH THE HIP LIKE YOU'VE GOT MOBILITY BUT IF YOU DON'T FULLY STABLEIZE IT BY TRAINING ALL THE MUSCLES OF THE HIP AND IF YOU DON'T STRENGTH IN THE EXTERNAL ROTATION OF THE HIP THEN YOU YOU'VE YOURE YOU'REGING TO HAVE ISSUES LIKE IT'S NOT BIND TE CANYGIN A WORK THE SAME WAY IF YOU THINK OF THE BODY IS A SERIES OF YOU BANDS YOT PULLING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF TENSION YOU KNOW YOU'RE BEING PULLED INTO ONE DIRECTION OF THE OTHER JUST BY THE BALANCE OF TENSION FROM ONE WEAK AREA TO ONE DOMINANTLY TIGHT AREA AND YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN SORT OF BALANCES OUT IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE SOME OF THE DAPTATIONS AND COMPENSATIONS THAT HAPPEN SO WHAT I SAY WHEN WE LOOK IT SORT OF THE THE A THE THE BODY IS A WHOLE MOST OFTEN WHEREVER YOU'RE FEELING THE PAIN IS HABSOLUTELY NOT TO BLAN THERE'S NOT BLAMT IT IS SOMEWHERE ABOVE WERE BELOW AS YOU HINTED THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE THE KNES OF MY MY FAVORITE EXAMPLE OF IT WHENEVER YOU HAVE KNEE PAIN TELLIU TENAN IT IS WHICH I I I HAVE FOR EVER 'VE HAD YO BAD BAT CASES OF TOLI TO NIGCE WHERE SQUATDING IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME IT'S NOT THE KNEE THE KNEE IS THE KNEE IS LITERALLY A HINGE JOINT THAT THAT YOTHERE'S MINOR ROTATION CAPABILITIES OF NEEBUT IT'S A HINGE JOINT AND IT'S BEING IMPACTED BY THE HIP IN THE ANKLE AND IN THE FOOT AS I SAID BEFORE HOW CRITICAL THE FOOT IS IF YOU THOUGHT OF OF THE KNEE BEING THE LIKE THE MIDDLE OF A TRAIN TRACK WHERE THE FEMER DOWN YOUR THIGH AND YOUR SHIN DOWN BELOW YOUR KNEE WHERE THE TRAIN TRACK WOULD HAPPEN IF THE FOOT COLLAPSE IS AT THE BOTTOM AL OF A SUDDEN THAT TRIN TRACK ON THE BOTTOM GETS TORKED JUST A LITTLE BIT WELL WHOSE GAN TO FEEL THAT THE MOST THE ARY WHERE ITS TORKING WHICH IS AT THE KNEE SO THE STRESSES ARE CAN BE FELT THERE MEANWHILE THE PROBLEMS THE FOOT OR THE PROBLEM IS THE ANKLE PEOPLE THAT ARE CHRONIC ANKLE SPRAINERS YOU ARE ALMOST ALWAYS GOING TO WINE UP HAVING BACK PAIN BECAUSE THE ANKLE SPRAIN CAUSES WEAKNESS AND MALADAPTATIONS IN THE ANKLE THAT THEN GETS CONNECTED THROUGH THE CHAIN BECAUSE NOW ONE SIDE DISTORT THE ANKLE ON THE SHIN NOW THE KNEE IS TRYING TO MAINTAIN IT'S ABILY TO HINGE SMOOTHLY SO IT TORKS ON THE FEMER TO DO THAT WHELL THE FEMERS NOW INSIDE THE HIP JOIN PULLING ON THE PELVIS AND THE PELVAS IS TAT A WAX SO IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY IS FASTENING LIKE IT'S ONE MY FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT HOW THE BODY WORKS IS LIKE HOW IT INTERCONNECTED IT IS AND HOW ONE LITTLE THING SOMEWHERE CUSES REPRECUTIONS SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THE EASIEST WAY TO FIND OUT WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS IS TO SAY A CAY I KNOW WHERE MY SYNTIM IS BUT Y GOT TO FIND SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP ME FIND THE SOURCE SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE IT IS GING TO BE USUALLY EITHER ABOVE OR BELOW MOSTLY USUALLY BELOW CAUS IT USUALLY TRANSLATES UP THE CONNATTY CHAIN BUT USUALLY IS GAN TO BE BELOW ON WHERE THE REAL SOURCE IS UP PEOPLE WITH LOW BACK PAIN USUALLY HAVE HIP ISSUES WEAKNESS IS TIGHTNESS IS FLEXIBILITY O ISSUES IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS BELOW UM W GET TO REALLY HIGH PERFORMANCE ATHLETICS THOUG IT IT ALMOST WORKS THE OTHER WAY LIKE WHERE WE HAVE PICTURES WHO CAN'T A ME I AMALWAYS FASCTENING BY GUIDES THAT HAVE A A TOMMY JOHN ISSUES SEALING THEIR ELBOW RIGHT PITCTURES LIKE IF YOU CAN'T EXTERNALLY ROTATE THE SHOULDER AV WE TAUGHT ABOUT AGAIN THE ABILITY GET YOUR SHOULDER BACK AND EXTROTATION WOL YOUR ARM HAS TO GET TO A SERTAIN POSITION FOR RELEASE OF THE BASEBALL AND IF IT CAN'T GET THERE YOU CAN'T EXTROTVER TO THE SHOULDER TO GET THERE THEN THE ELBOW HAS TO SORT OF TORK MORE IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE ARM TO GET BACK FURTHER AND IT WILL TRY TO TAKE SOME OF THAT MOTION FROM A JOINTS US NOT RELY AGAIN ANOTHER HINT ANOTHER HINSTROY REALLY CAPABLE DOING THAT SO STRUTCH A STRESS THAT MEDIA LELBOW LIGAMENT TO GET A LITTLE BIT FURTHER BACK BECAUSE THE SHOULDERS NOT WORK AND AND THAT JUST ULTIMATLY PLACE TA STRA IN THE ELBOW SO WHEN YOU SEE GUY THAT HAS A PAIN THAT FLOATS AROUND A PICTURE THAT FLOATS AROUND OR ARM ALL THAT IS IS SORT OF THIS BALANCE OF CONPENSATION ONCE HIS SHOULDER ELBOWSTOUR TURTAIN THEN HE CAN'T DO THE GET THE RAIN THE O THE RANGE FROM THE ELBOW SO HE TRIES THO DIGG ABLE IT FURTHER BACK AND TEXTOR OTATION AND THEN THE RETUR CUFF GETS INFLAME AND THEN HE FEELS THAT'S INFLAME SO I THET BY THE WAY OF DURING THAT TIME PERIOD TAKE SOME THE STRAIN OUT THE ELBOWS TO THE EBOW FEELS BETTER THEN HE DECIDES O CAN NOW I GOT THE EXTR ROTATION BUT I'V GETN TOO MUCH OF THAT SO NI STAR STRAIN IN THE ELBOW AGAIN AND THEN KEEPS GOIN THRO THE CYCLE SO YOUR BODY IS VERY SMART AND IT'S GOOD A CONPENSAT EVERY SINGLE TIME IS GOING TO FIND THE CONPESATION BUT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE TO THAT COVERSATION DOESN'T LEAVE YOU WITH A WHOLEHOST OF OTHER ISSUES YET'S FASCINATING UM IN ANOTHER LIFETIME I WOULD GONE A BEN A PETE ALTHOUGH IT SOUNDS LIKE THE COMMUNITY OF AMONG E'S OT LINES AT AO IT IT LISTE THE LER WE'RE TVEREOPPLE BUT IT'S LIKEYES SCIENTISTS AND NER SCIENTISTIC AND GETTINTO PRETTY INTENSE BATTLES YOU KNOW IN COMING FROM THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY NOT T THE ETICETT IS SO DIFFERENT ON LINE BECAUSE I WAS SAY YOU MIGHTHINKING PERSON PEOPLE WOULD PROBABLY BEHAVE OF IT IT A ONLY YOUR HAND IN SAID HELLOW YE TAKE YOUR HAND AN SAY HELLOW AND AND UM AND THERE'S ALSO IT LUK OU I'LL JUST BE VERY DIRECT ABOUT THIS THEYRE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON LINE FOR WHOM THEY'RE ONLY CONTENT IS POINTING OUT THE A MISUNDERSTANDINGS OR ALLEGED FLAWS OF OTHER PEOPLE TOE'S LIKE THAT IT WERE IT'S LIKE THE BULK OF THEIR IDENTYAS WE TO ME A SORT OF A SAD EXISTENCE BUT UM YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS MORE TO GAIN BY THING ABOUT WHAT'S POSSIBLE WHAT'S NEW IND WHAT'S GOOD BUT YOU KNOW TO EACH THEIR OWN UM DE MISE UM OR WIN I ME QUESTION QUESTIONING WHAT'S OUT THERE IS HELP SURE AND ALMOST GREAT IT ACTUALLY PARS CONVERSATION A BUT AS YOU SAY SOME PEOPLE'S EXISTENCE IS SOLELY TO FINE THINGS TO YE NAGABOUT AND AND NOT ACTUALLY WITH THE GOALD BEING TO ADVANCE ANYTHING BUT RATHER JUST TO YET IN THE WORLD OF SCIENCE UM BEING SCEPTICAL BUT NOT SYNTICAL IS IS ENCOURAGED UM BUT I WAS SAY THAT THE LONGER THAT SOMEBODY'S IN A CAREER PATH IT CERTAINLY IN SCIENCE FOR MEDICINE AND THEY REALIZE HOW HARD IT IS TO OU A YOU KNOW TO DO VERY STUDIES ONCE THEY PUBLISH A FEW STUDIES GENERALLY THEY THE SORT OF A GET A A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW HOW THE VARIOUS THINGS ARE DONE IN ANY CASE AM A ANOTHER ALONG THE LINES OF A PAIN AND PAIN RELIEF AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF PAIN IN THE BODY A ONE OF THE GREAT A TOOLS THAT I  A PICKED UP FROM YOUR CONTENT WHICH IS BENEFIT I KNOWIN A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLES I THINK I USED TO HOLD A WEIGHTS SOMETIMES IN THE IN THE TIPS OF MY FINGERS AS HOST IN THE MEAT OF THE PALM OF MY HANDS AND I HAD ELBOW PANE AND ALWS THOUGHT THAT I FELT IT MOST ONTRYSEP EXERCISES AND PUSHING EXERCISE AND I THOUGHT I WAS DOING THOSE EXERCISE AS WRONG TURNS OUT I TOWARD THE END OF MY PULL UPS OR MY BYSEP WORK I WAS LETTING THE WEIGHT OR THE BAR DRIFTINTO MY FINGER TIPS AND THE MERE AM SHIFT TO MAKING SURE THAT MY KNUCKLES WERE WELL OVER THE BAR OR THAT THE WEIGHT WAS REALLY IN THE MEAT OF MY PALMS HAS COMPLETELY AMILIORATED THAT FOR REASONS THAT YOU POINT OUT AND MAYBEYOU COULD SHARE WITH US WHY THAT IS AM YET THIS KIND OF FINGER PULL EXERCISE YOU YUSUALY WENE SOCE US PULL MY FINGER ITS A METTLS OR  MENTE SCOOL JO ULITL THIS  S A PUSH YOUR ER I WRIT A Y THI THEA THIS IS FASSING THAT THAT THIS IS A BECAUSE IT JUST SHOWS AGAIN HOW INTRICATE THE BODY IS AND HOW RESPONS OFER OVER RESPONSE IF IT CAN BE TO SOMETHING SO LITTLE AND YOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THAT WHEN YOU GRIP A BAR WHERE THERE IT BE THROUGH A CURL OR WHETHER BEIN THIS IS MOSTLY PULLING EXERCISES BECAUSE THE TENDENCY FOR THE BARS CAN BE TO FALL OUT OF YOUR HAND NOT LIKE WITH E PUSHING EXERCISE WHERE ITS COUNTOF YOU YOU'RE OUR PUSHING YOUR AND INTO THE BARSO ON HE BENCH PRESS SI A THAT BAR CAN DRIFT JUST BY GRAVITY WEU WENT DOING THIS THING OR FATIGUE OF THE THE HAND GRIP STRENGTH CANSTART TO DRIFT FURTHER AWAY TOWARDS THE THE DISTAL DIGITS RIGHT THROUGH THOSE THROUGH THOSE LAST COUPLE KNUCKLES THAT WE HAVE ON OUR HANDS AND THOUGH OUR HAND CAN STILL HOLD IT THERE A THE MUSCLES ARE NOT EQUIPPED TO HANDLE THOSE TYPES OF LOADS AND THAT CAN STARTED A VERY I I LING U TAY LIGHT BUT LIKE YOU KNOW IT CAN START IT YOU KNOW DUMBBELL WIGHT YOU KNOW FORTY POUNDS THIRTY POUNDS YO EVEN TWENTY FIVE POUNDS OR SOME DEPENING UPON THER OVER ALL STRENGTH LEVELS BUT THEN WE USED TART TO APPLY IT TO SOMETHING LIKE YOUR BODY WEIGHT WITH A CHIN UP I COSSESS NATURAL FOR THE BARD OF SOMEWHAT KIND OF FLOAT DOWN TOWARDS YOUR FINGER TIPS IN IT ACTUALLY IS A LITTLE EASIER TO PERFORM THE EXERCISE WITH THAT SORT OF LIKE FALSE GRIP LITTLE HOOK GRIP AT THE END BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GET ENGAGED THE FORARMS INTO THE EXERCISE YOU NOTT R START PULLING DOWN BUT AT THE SAME TIME WHILE IT COULD HELP YOU TO PER FORM THEM BETTER BY GETTING THE BACK MORE ACTIVATED IF YOU HAVE WEAKNESS IN THESE MUSCLES CAUSE NOT IS NOT A THING THAT HAPPENS THAT IT IT IS NOT ONE OF THOSE UPRIGHT ROAD TIGHT THINGS WHERE I THINK THES IS HAT HAPPENING TO EVERYBODY THIS IS HAPPENING TO PEOPLE THAT HAVIES IN HERENT WEAKNESS IS IN THIS IN THIS A IN IN THIS THESE MUSCLES YOU OR OR HAVNG DONE ENOUGH OF THE GRIPPING IN THE FOR IN IN THE MEAT OF THE HAND YOU KNOW FOR LONG ENOUGH BUT IT STARTS TO PUT THAT STRESS ON THESE MUSCLES TARE IL EQUIPP TO DO THIS AND IT TO HANDLE THIS AN IT STARTS TO IS PARTICULARLY ON THAT FORTH FINGER YOU KNOW WHICH IS PART OF THE MUSCLE WE CALL THE F TS O FLEXILTI A TOREM THAT IT'S JUST TOO MUCH FOR TO HANDLE AN THAT COMES ALL THE WAY DOWN AN MEETS RIGHT AT THE MEDIAL ELBEL ROUND THAT SPOT THAT YOU CAN SAY FEELS LIKE SOME OF THE NIFE THING YOU RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE IN THAT MEATLE ELBOW AND IN MEDIAL EPICONDOLITUS OR THEY CALL IT GALFER'S ELBOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF US DEAL WITHIN THE GIM IT'S ONE OF THE MOST COMMON AND FLAMMATORY CONDITIONS PEOPLE GET FROM THE GIM AND IT ALL COMES FROM THIS POSITIONING OF THE DUMBBELL OR BARBELL OR HAND ON A PULL A BAR OVERTIME SO THE EASIEST THING TO DO IS JUST GRIP DEEPER SO THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE USING OYE MORE LEVERAGE FROM THE PALM TO IN CAPSOL ATE THE BAR OR THE DUMBBELLER WOULDEVER AN YOU'RE NOT PUTTING THAT PRESSURE REALLY DISTILY RIGHT ON THAT LAST DICH IT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE THAT AFTS MUSCLE IS MOST STRAINED SO YOU YOU'RE JUST ALMOST TELIMITING THAT FROM THE EQUATION AND IN IN IT'S ONE WAS EXERCISES THAT THE LOAD CAN EXCEED ITS CAPACITY PRETTY QUICKLY SO THAT LIKE EAL T IT MAYBE ITS ONLY CABAE F HANDLING THIRTY POUNDS AND THEN WE YOU'RE DOING A CHIN UP ANY GOES IN IT DRIFT SO FAR THAT IT'S NOW YUA SAY YOURE TWO UNDRED POUND GUY YOU'VE GOT AND SAY A HUNDRED POUNDS THROUGH ONE ARM IN A UNDRED POUNDS THIS IS SIMPLE SIMPLIFIED MAT THAT OVESLY IS OFFSET BY OTHER MUSCLES BUT  HUNDRED POUNDS THO ONE ARM HUNDRED POUNDS THERE A HUNDRED POUNDS OFF OF A MUSCLE IT CAN HANDLE THIRTY IS NOT IN TO TAKE MANY REPETITIONS TO STRAIN IT AND YOU'RE GING TO FEEL THAT MAYBE BY THE TIME THAT SETS OVER OR CERTAINLY BY THE TIME THAT WORK OUTS OVER THE NEXT DAY YOU WAKE UP YOU'VE GOT THAT NOTABLE STAVING PAIN WHENEVER SOME ONE FEELS THAT YOU THE BEST THING WOULD BE TO DETERMINE OCA WHAT EXERCISE WHET I DOING THAT WERE PULLING AND WHERE THE BAR COULD HAVE DRIFTED DEEPER THER INTO THE FURTHER FROM THE ME TO MY PALM INTO MY FINGERS AN FIGUR OUT A WAY THAT DEEPEN THAT GRIP WHEN THAT HAPPENS THOUGH THE BEST THING TO DO WOUL MOST OF THESE INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS IS NOT DO ANY OF THAT STUFF FOR A LITTLE WHILE NOT EVER JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE THERE'S ALWAYS THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO AROUND IT I'M NOT SAYING EVER DO I SAY LIKE DON'T GO TO THE JIM OR DON'T FIND SOMETHING YOU CAN DO BUT I'M SAYING THT PARTICULAR EXERCISE THAT YOU FEEL THE PAIN ON WHILE YOU'RE DOING IT NEVER SMART IDEA TO DO THAT EXERCISE WHEN IT'S IN FLAINED IF YOU ERE DOING EXERCISE AND IT HURTS YOU PROBLISH INTO THE EXERCISE BECAUSE ANOTHER YOUN YO REASON OT FOR THE VERY BUILDY OF EXERCISEAN THERE THERE'S SO MANY OTHER OPTIONS THAT YOU CAN DO THATE WILL TRAIN SIMILAR MUSCLES ORE EVEN THE SAME MOTION AND NOT CAUSE THAT STRESS SO I MEAN A CABLE A CABLE CURL WOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO DO THAT ON THEN LET'S SAY A CHIN UP WHER YOU DON'T HAVE THE CONTROL OVER THE WEIGHT LIKE YOU DO BY MOVING A PIN ON A STACK SO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THAT THAT IS A COMMON THING THAT PEOPLE FIND IN THE BEST THING TO DO IS JUST FIGURE OUT HOW GREEP  HOW DEEPER YOU GRIPIN TAT BARING YOURN TO FIND THAT ALL MY GOT ANY REALIZE THAT BECAUSE IT WAS JUST EVEN THOUGH YOU O MUCH STARTED THAT IN A G AN POSITION IN A IT DRIFT AWAY AS YOU GO YA I THA THINK THETS AL WAYS HAPPENING ME AND AM VERY CONSCIOUS OF THIS NOW ANDGAIN FOR ME IT'S I HAVEN'T HAD TIS ELBLE PAN AT ALL SO THAT'S GREE NOUGH T VERY FORTUNE SO AGAIN DETO GRATITUDE TOOU NEVER I THOUGHT OF SOME ROWL IN MY ELBOW EXICALLY A AND O THOUGHT IT MAYBE  TENNIS ALL BY OIN PLAY TENNIS AND SO A THERE YOU GO M OTHER ASPECTS OF RECOVERY IN VER VERIABLES FOR RECOVERY A I THINK I YOU AND I BOTH PUT OUT CONTENT ABOUT THE USE OF COLD AND I THINK WE CAN SUMRISEIT BY SAYING YET DOES SEEM LIKE COLD WATER IMMERSION IMMEDIATELY AFTER I PERCHAFFER YOUR STRAIN T WORK OUTS MIGHT BE PROM BUT A COLD SHOWERS POAN OT APOM WHAT ABUT HEAT UM DO YOU DO YOU PERSONALLY USE HEAT AND COLD A SONAS HOT THA YOU HOT BATS A HOT COMPRESS IS UM YOU AND BY YOU I MEAN YOU PERSONALLY AND AND AFFLEATS UM THAT YOU COACH WOR PEOPLE THAT YOU COACH UM WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE USE OF HEAT AND WORE COR A WE I THINK YOU KNOW IT MIGHT JUST BE ANINHERITED PRACTICE FROM THE DAYS OF UTRAINDARDS OF OF A YOU KNOW SENSE THA BABE RUTH YOU KNOW BUT WE WE IN BASEBALE WE USED A LOT OF COLD FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE THE THE IDEA WOULD BE THERE THERE IS SOME ESPECIALLY PICTURES AND THERE IS SOME INFLAMMATION A THAT IS ABNORMAL O THE ARM IS NOT REALLY DESING TO DO WHAT THEY DO ESPECIALLY AT THE AT THE SPEED THAT THEY MOVE IT AND EVERYTHING ELSE SO WE WOULD USE YOU ICE AS A PRETTY STANDARD PRACTICE AFTER THAT A BUT NOT NOW LOT A HEAT IN WHEN  YOU USE LOT A HEAT IN OF COURSE FROM THE RECOVERY OT ER THA THE HEALING ASPECT THAT ACTUALLY BECOMES RATHER A PERSONAL PREFERENCE THEY'VE FOUND NOW A AFTER LET' SAY THE FIRST TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS YOU KNOW WHERE YOU REALLY TRYING TO CONTROL INFLAMMATION OF WHAT YOU KNOW MIGHT BE AN INJURY BUT THEN IT THEN IT CAN KIND OF SHIFT TO PERSONAL PREFERENCE BECAUSE THE HEA CAN BRING BLOOD TO THE AREA ALSO AND HEN THE YOTHA THE THE COLD HAS ITS SORT OF ANTI A INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS SELECE THERE'S THAT THERE'S A BALANCE BETWEEN WHICH ONE'S WORKING BETTER FOR YOU SO THERE'SALE NO STANDARD ANY MORE FOR HEAT OR COLD IN THAT WAY BUT FROM A STANDPOINT OF LIKE POST O WORK OUT HEALTHY STATIS A I HAVEN'T USE MUCH HEAT OR COLD IN TERMS OF WHAT WE DO W YOUON LY COVER THE TOPIC OF THE COLD SHOWERS AND TO TRY TO DISPEL THE MIDTH OF TE A YOU KNOW EVEN PEOPLE SAYING THAT THERE'S TRYING TO STOCSTRON RELEASES AND IN ALL KINDS OF STUFF THAT YOU KNOW LISTENT WE HEARE ALL KINDS OF THINGS CAUS PEOPLE WAT LIKE I THINK THE IDEA JUST TURNING THE WATER COLD AND BEING IN IT FOR THIRTY SECONDS AND THEN ALL THE SUDDEN MAGICALLY GROWING THREE TIMES YOUR SIZE IS INTRIGUING OT OF PEOPLE AND THEY AND THAT'S WHY THEY ASKE THESE QUESTIONS CANE  LEKE I'L BE A HEL LOT EASIER THAN I TO GIER IN TRAINING HARD BUT I GOT ALWAYS FASCINATED BY SOME OF THE STUFF THAT THAT YOU TALK ABOUT FACT WE START A TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE STUFF IN TERMS OF COOLING AND WHAT IT CAN DO ON PERFORMANCE AND THATIS YOU KNOW LIKE THERE THERE'S SOME ONTAPPED TERRITORY THERE THAT I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE FINDING OUT ABOUT YAT WHO WE FUN WOULD BE TO BRING THE COOL MIT TECNOLOGY FROM STAMPER THIS IS CRAG HEL AT MY COLLYE CREG HELLER S A LABBIT TAMPERS ONE REALLY IMPORTANT IN A AMAZING WORK IN THIS AREA BUT THEN I MOVED ON TO SOME OTHER THINGS HE'S ALSO WORKING ON GOUNCIND JERMAN HE WORKS ON A NUMBER OF OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT TOPICS A SCING TIS OFTEN DO A BUT I HAVE A ACCESS TO THE SCHOOLMIT TECHNOLOGY NO RELATIONSHIP TO THE COMPANY BY THE WAY WED LOVE TO COME OUT TO YOUR FACILITY AND AND A WE CAN DO THE BLIND A RIPE STUDIES AND BLUE BLOCKER XAXACTLY AND IM AND SEE HOW THAT GOES I IN IN WITH SOMEBODY ADVANCE AS ADVANCED TRAINED TO YOU IM THE THAT'S PRY BEST ING TO SO A CONTENT FOR THE FUTURE IM YE I THINK HEAT AND COLDAR ARE KIND OF STAPLES IN THE PEATY WORLD AN NIGHT DOES SEE MY PEOPLE USE THEM I'M SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY BUT THEY ARE THEY ARE KIND OF THE MACKER NEW TREANTS OF OF RECOVERY THERE ALONG ALONG A SLEEP IM I WOUD I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT PRECISION OF RECORD KEEPING DO YOU KEEP A TRAINING JOURNAL IT YOU RECOMMEND PEOPLE KEEP TRAINING JOURNALS ARE YOU NAURADICALLY FIXED TO YOU KNOW CADENTS OF MOVEMENT AND ARE YOU LOOKING AT THE YOU HAVE A BUZZ ER GOING OFF FOR NIGHT WHEN IT'S NINETY SECONDS REST AS IT NINETY SECONDS REST I CONFESS I'VE MY SLOW WORK OUTS AND MY FASTER WORK OUTS IM AND THEY SCALE WITH WHEN I'M TRAINING HEAVIER WITH LONGER REST OR WHETHER NOT MAYBE MIDWAY THROUGH A WORK OUT OR SHIFT OVER TO DOING HIGHER REPETITION LOWER REST THIS THIS KIND OF A MI OUNA CRUDE WAY OF O KEEPING TIME BUT I'M NOT YOU DON'T WILL BE JUST A CON A WATCH THE CLOCK BUT I'M NOT NAURADICALLY FIXE TO THE BUZZER NOR AM I ON SOCIAL MEDIA DURING MY WORK OUTS WHICH IS THAT SHEA WAY TO REALLY IMPROVE WORKOUSEAS TO JUST NOT BE ON SOCIAL MEDIA II CAN'T CLAIM THEM NOT GUILTY OF THAT SOMETIMES I AM ON SOCIAL MEDIA UT SOMETIMES ON TRYING TO POST SOMETHING WHE TAT'S DIFFERENT IS ER IT'S ER AN IT'S TERRESTION BUT I MEEN  I AM I I'M NOT I'M NOT A NECESSARILY A CHAIN TO SOME SORT OF PROTOCAL IN TERMS OF HOW I DO I THINK BY THIS WO MEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME ANNOTOLY IS IT SOME THAT I'VE DONE FOR A LONG TIME BUT IT' IT'S A PASSION OF MYS AN THEY ARE REALLY ENJOY SO I PROBABLY INHERENTLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO STICK TO THESE THESE A GUY LINES AN TERMS OF REST TIME A TO NOW WHAT I LIFTED YO KNOW EVEN SIX MONTHS AGO ON A LIFT AND AN AN HOW IT FELL WITHOUT JOURNALING IT BUT I RECOGNIZE THE VALUE IT HAS TO A LOT OF PEOPLE GOES BACK TO THAT WHOLE MY MUSCLE CONNECTION IDEA TAF WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE BEGINNING LIKE THERE'S A LACK OF  WARINESS FOR ALL ASPECTS OF TRAINING IT SPECIALLY MAYBE IT ISN'T LIKE YOUR R INTERESTS LOVELY AND WE'RE TALKING YOU AND I FROM A A A POSITION OF INTEREST LIKE THIS IS WHAT WE DO WE WE ENJOY JUST HOW OUR BODYES WORK IN UNDERSTANDING HOW THEY WORK SOME PEOPLE DON'T CARE TH THIS WANT THE END RESULT BUT JOURNALLING IN KEEPING TRACK OF THAT RAISES A WARENESS TO REALIKE ALL MI GOT II I HAVE BEEN ON THE A ISTOGRAND FOR LAST SEVEN MINUTES AND I'LL SUPPOSE TO BE BACK AT MY NEXT SET AND NINETY SECONDS LIKE THERE IS A TRAINING EFFECT OF THAT AN ICU YOU YOU IF YOUR TRAININ FOR METABOLIC OVERLOAD YOU'VE BLOWN THAT OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE YOU HAVE YO YOUR REST TIME WAS VERY SA WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO THAT PRO TO CALL WORKING AS IT SHOULD UM IF YOU ARE TRAINING FOR STRENGTH MAY BE THE EXTRA FEW MINUTES DOESN'T MATTER SO MUCH WHEN YOU GET BACK OND THE MAR YOU MIGHT FIND I MEAN YOU MIGHT FIND THAT IT'S A BETTER RESPONSE FOR YOUR BODY TO REST EVEN LONGER THAN YOU'VE BEEN TOLD FREE FOUR MINUTES FIVE MINUTES UM AND SO THAT WAY MAY BE AT HELPS BUT I THINK THAT ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO INCREASE YOUR WARENESS OF YOUR PERFORMANCE AND ALSO GIVE YOURSELF SOME OBJECTIVE GOAL WHENEVER WE HAVE AN OBJECTIVE GOAL AS LOTIES YOU'R TAS SHE OBTAIN IT WHEN YOU'RE JUST THERE TO GET A PUMP AN YOU'RE JUST THERE TO LIFT HOW YOU FEEL THAT DAY UM YOU HAVE TO BE INCREDIBLY DISCIPLINE IN ALL OTHER ASPECTS OF YOUR WORK OUT IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT EFFECTIVE YOU KNOW AND I AD I'VE DONE THAT TOO I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT TOO BUT I GAN THE LEVEL UOF REPETITIONS I'VE ACCUMULATED OVER THE COURSE OF MY LIFE IN THE IN THE AMOUNT THAT IT THAT I YOU'L READ ABOUT THIS STUFFIN I'M I THINK I'M ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH THAT BUT UM BUT I THINK MORE OFTEN THAN NOT WHAT I'M DOING IS NOT JOURALING BUT JURN AT JURLING IN MY HEAD EXACTLY WHAT I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE DOING IN THAT IS GETTING A SPECIFIC EFFECT FROM WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IT'S NOT SO HAPHAZARD YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO GET A SPECIFIC EFFECT JUST LIKE ANY OTHER EXPERIMENT THAT YOU DOIN YOU DON'T EXPERIMENT ON YOUR OWN BODY WITH YOUR OWN WAYS WHICH TO ME IS ONE THE MOST IMPOWERING THING SOMEONE CAN EVER DO WHEN THEY GET BITTEN BY THE BUG FOR YOU EXERCISING AND IN TRAINING AND A ILEC TO YOUSE WORE TRAINING INS RATHER THAN EXERCISE AS A PURPOSE BEHIND IT FOR WHEN THEY GET BIT N BY THAT TRAINING BUG AND THEY START TO SEE ACTUAL CHANGES AND RESULTS YOUM POWERING THAT IS CAS WE CAN'T CAN'T WE CAN'T REALLY CONTROL THAT MANY THINGS IN OUR LIFE UNFORTUNATELY ANS THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO US THAT WE REALLY WISH NEVER HAPPEN UM AND THOSE ARE NOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO ANTHING ABOUT BUT THIS IS ONE THING THAT WE CAN DO OUR BEST TOWE CAN'T AVOID DISEASE ENTIRELY WE CAN'T PREDICLOR IN A DIE WE CAN'T YO DO THOSE THINGS BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY DECIDE TO SHOW INTO THE GIM THAT DAY AND GET A WORK OUT IN OR GO FOR RUN OR DO SOMETHING AND BY DOING THAT YOU'RE GIVING YOURSELF I THINK THE BETTER CHANCE OF A HIGHER CALL YOUR LIFE SO ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO INCREASE YOUR WARENESS OF IT AND KEEP YOU ON TRACK WITH THAT IS LIKE I'M ADORSING FULLY COULDN'T A GREE MORE I COULD NOT AGREE MORE THE THERE'S A TOPMAK IT SO OF A DREADED TOPIC WHAT I THINKS AN IMPORTANT ONE IN THAT'S TE TOPIC OF NUTRITION UM AND RATHER THEY GAN INTO SPECIFIC MEAL PROGRAMMS WHICH YO WOULD YOU KNOW TAKE TAKE HOURS AND EN PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN MANAGE TO SCRATCH THE SURFACE EVEN WITH OURS UM I WE COULD TALK ABOUT PRINCIPLES AROUND NUTRITION UM WHATER SORT OF THE STHEMES THAT YOU THINK PEOPLE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND I NWENTING ABOUT HOW TO EAT  GENERALLY UM AND PRE TRAINING AND POST TRAINING ARE TWO UM PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TIMES FOR MOST OR TIMES TO PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW ALL OT ABOUT YO WHAT SHOULD THEY EAT BEFORE TRAINING OR CAN THEY TRAIN FAST AGE WHICH SHOULDTHEY EAT AFTERWARDS BUT YIUTION GENERAL WHAT EATHING ERE SOME SOME AXIUMS OF OF OF NUTRITION THAT THAT REALLY HOLD AND I ASK US I OF BECAUSE NOT BECAUSE THE'S A LOT OF DEBATE  ABOUT THIS BUT BECAUSE YUBEEN AROUND THIS FACE A LONG TIME AN AND YOU SEEM WHAT WORKS FOR YOU OBVIOUSLY BUT FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO YOU KNOW WHAT TENDS TO WORK WHAT TENDS NOT TO WORK AND EM OW SHALL WE THINK ABOUT NUTRITION I MEAN LT YOU YOU'V TOUCHED ONAT BIT BUT LIKE HEM NUTRITION CAN' BE A TOUCHY SUBJECT FOR PEOPLE AND IN I UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT COMES FROM MY I'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THE THERE'S A DOGMATIC TENDENCY TO TO NUTRICION AND THERE'S A REASON FOR BECAUSE IT'S AN AREA THAT PEOPLE STRUGGLE WITH MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND THE REASON WHY PEOPLE STRUGGLE WITH NUTRITION IS BECAUSE THE COMMITMENT IS EXTREMELY HIGH YOU KNOW YOU COULD START TO WORK OUT FOR AGRAM IN ACTUALLY GET TO THE GIM THREE TO FIVE TIMES A WEEK THAT'S FIVE HOURS BASED ON HOW YOU AND I WERE DISCUSSING IT BEFORE WELL WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER TWENTY THREE HOURS OF EACH OF THOSE DAYS THERE'S OPPORTUNITY TO EAT IN CORRECTLY OR UNHEALTHILY EVERY ONE OF THOSE HOURS PEOPLE WAKE UP IN THE MILDL AND LIH TO GO EAT YOU KLIKE THERE ARE THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO THAT CAN CAUSE AMAZING AMOUNTS OF DAMAGE O TO YOUR LONGEVITY IN THE TWENTY THREE HOURS NOT THE ONE HOUR THE TWENTY THREE HOURS SO WHEN PEOPLE FINALLY FIGURE OUT OF AWAY TO MAKE THAT WORK FOR THEM IT'S VERY PASSIONATE AND I UNDERSTAND THEIR PASSION I DO LIKE I'VE PUT OUT SO MY APPROACH MY APPROACH IS LIKE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SORT OF A LOW SUGAR LOW WORK FAT GUY I'VE MADE THE MISTAKE OF GOING NO FAT YEARS AGO AND I PAID FOR IT I WAS LIKIN COLLEGE AND YOUL BACK IN THE DAY WE'RE THE SAME AGE YOU KNOW WE READ ALL THE MAGAZINES AND OUR THAT WAS WHAT WE HAVEW HAVE 'T ER NOT THEN SO WE WERE WE WERE READING MAGAZINES AND THE RECOMMENDO PATH WAS TO GO LOW FAT O IT HELPS YOU TO BECOME I POL COLORIC VERY EASILY BECAUSE THE DENSITY OF THE CUT CALLORIES YON A GRAM OF FAT VERSES A GRAM OF CARBOHYDRATES OF PROTINE IS NINE VERSES FOR FOR THE CARVES AN PROTINE SO IF YOU'RE CUTTING OUT GRAMS OF FAT ON A DAILY BASIS YOU'RE QUICKLY CUTTING OUT CALLORIES THAT ALLOWS YOU TO GET LEANER WELL OF COURSE AS EVERYTHING I MEAN I' IF LITTLE IS GOOD THAND A LOT IS BETTER SO I WOULD CUT ALL OF THEM OUT OR ALMOST ALL OF THEM AND AT THE AGE OF TWENTY TO TWENTY ONE ILIKE STANDING AT A A STOP I UP IT UNIVERSILY CONNECTICUT WAITING FOR THE TRAM TO COME AND BRING ME TO CAMPAS AND I COULDN'T EVEN OPEN MY EYES BECAUSE THE LIGHT WAS BLINDING TO ME IT WAS NORMAL SUNLIGHT IT WAS BLINDED TO ME THE FOTOL SENSITIVITY I HAD YOU KNOW LEARNING LATER ON AFTER A FEW MORE COURSES THAT I TOOK THERE AND BIOLOGY YOU KNW HOW HOW R NECESSARY FAT WAS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTHY YOU KNOW A SELLS I I REALIZE WHA WAS GOING ON O ENOTHING AT OTHER STUFF SKIN WAS BAD HAIR WAS FALLEN OUT ALL KINDS OF STUFFS SO I I I THINK THAT THE APPROACH TO DECREASING FAT SO'S NOT EXCESSIVE YOOUN BECAUSE AGAIN HOW COLORICALLY DENCE IT COULD BE IN HAVING LOWER SUGAR I DON  I'M O A FIRM BELIEVER AND SUGAR IS REALLY PRETTY TOXIC AND O SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD ALL DO BETTER GETTING RID OF A LOT OF IT O THAT IS THE BEST APPROACH FOR I BELIEVE AGAIN IN MY OPINION PERSONALLY FOR THE OVER ALL BIG PICTURE BECAUSE THOUGH THE PEOPLE CAN TAKE EXCLUSIONARY APPROACHES TO NATRITION IN TAKING CARBS OUT OR YOU KNOW  EATING ONLY FATS AND PROTEINES OR AGAIN I'M NOT SAYING IT DOESN'T WORK FOR YOU AND IF IT'S THE FIRST THING THAT ACTUALLY ALLOWED YOU TO GAIN CONTROL OF YOU NATRITION TO THE PONT REACTULLY SEL RESULTSN'T GOT TO A HEALTHIER WEIGHT THEN I ALWAYS SAY THEN DO IT THEN DO IT BUT JUST MAKE SURE SOMETHING YOU CAN DO FOREVER AND DOESN'T BRING UPON OTHER REPRECUSTIONS BUT I THINK THAT NON EXCLUSIONARY APPROACHES TO DIETS ARE THE THE MOST SUSTAINABLE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AND WHEN I AND ALL I'M ITERESTED IN FROM A NATRICIA STANDPOINTS SOMETHING AS SUSTAINABLE SO WHEN I PREACH WHAT I PREACH UP BEEN DOIN THIS SINCE I WAS FIFTEEN FOURTEEN YO PEOPLE SAYLI HAS HE GET SO RIPPED HAS YO GE I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR FORT SINCE  FOR HOW MANY YEARS THIRTY THIRTY YEARS THRETIN CLININ LOW SUGAR YE THIRTY YEARS YOU KNW AND IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS A SLOW SHIP I HAD TO MAKE WHERES LIKE I WENT FROM THE WORST DIE IN THE WHOLE WORLD I WAS EVEN WHEN IWAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLL MY BREAKFAST WAS I THOUGHT ABOUT THE SOMMIN TIMES BUT ENEMENS I WOULD EAT ENEMINS YOU KNOW DON'T US AND IN THOSE LONG ROAD EAOTE OSTER OF YE AN FROM EN TOOK THE WHOLE OUT OF THE DONA YE A WHY WOULD YOU  WHY WOULD YOU DELEAT THE MITTLEONA TO O THE CRUM THE CRUM DONA THERE I O I WOULD EI CAN'T DOTTIN MY I DON'T LIKE SUGAR VERY MUCH OVER THE YEARS I'VE LOST MY APPETITE FOR SUGAR I  HASE DOG BY THE ENGIMIN SO AS I CAN LETALLY SMELL AND TIT US THE FROSTING AND TO ME NOW IT'S DISCUSSING ABOUT THEN IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN APPETITE   WOULD PROBABLY HAVE LIKE REALLY GOOD INFORMATION ON THIS BUT LIKE MY ABILITY TO ACTUALLY REMEMBER I KNOWTHEYVE SAID SMELL IS VERY AINVOKING OF MEMORIES  HAV IT SO THERE'S A SMELL IS UNLIKE THE OTHER SENSES AS THERE'S A DEDIRECT LING LITERALLY FROM OUR SENSE OF SMELL TO THE MEMORY CENTERS OF THE BRAIN IT DOESN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH ANY INTERMEDIATE STATIONTHA SO YOU KNOW MY ABILITY TO ACTUALLY RECALL EXACT TASTE OF ALL THE STUFP THAT EAS TO LOVE IS ENOUGH TO SATISFY ME TO NOT  TO NOT ENGAGE IN THOSE THINGS NOW IS CRAZY THAT IS I I ALMOST GET MY FILL TO REMEMBERING CAUSE THESE STRONG SENSES OF A MEMORY OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE AS ODD ISE TO TASTE SO LOOK AT THAT'S GOT I HAD IT SO THAT AN TAS YET A WELL THAT'S THAT'S WE KNOW THE NERMODULATOR THERE THAT'S DOPENING YOUR ABILITY GET THE THE DOPEING RELEASE FROM THE THOUGHT OF SOMEBODY NOS OR PEOPLE WHEN THEY GET THAT DOPEMING RELEASE I CAUSE IS A A TRIGGERING OF THE DESIRE FROM MORN OR RY PEOPLE THIN OF DOPENING IS PLEASURE DOENING IT THAT THERE'S A BOOK GREAT BOOK CALLED THE MOLECULE OF MORE I DIDN'T WRITE THE BOOK UNFORTUNATELY BUT SOME ONE ELSE DID AND IT'S A GREAT BOOK AND IT'S REALLY BOUT DOPE MEAN WE THINK IT'S ABOUT PLEASURE BUT IT ESTABLISHES CRANG OTILL YOU'RE ABLE TO SATISFY THAT AND IT IT'S A VERY ADAPT O THING FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE INDEED VERY LEAN YE AND THAT'S ONE OF YOUR KIND OF HALL MARK THINGS AND YOU AS A PROFESSIONAL WHO DOES THIS IN THE PUBLIC SPACE THAT'S IMPORTANT YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE ARE OUT THEIRE TOING OUT GETTING LEAN OR I LOOK AT THEM AN YOU LIKE YOU KNOW MIT MAY BE YOU NEED TOF DO THE PROTOCOLPHS A IT'S A HUGE ADVANTAGE BUT YE I THINK THAT AM IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU CULTIVATED PRACTICES AROUND AVOIDING CERTAIN THINGS YES YET I MEAN BUT NOT YOU AVOIDING CERTAIN THINGS THAT I THINK ARE EASILY AVOIDED IF YOU REALIZE THAT THE INO THINK TO WE AVE ENOUGH SCIENCE AND LITERATURE OUT THERE TO PROVE THAT THE THE ALTERED PATH IS A BETTER PATH O YOU KNOW ME LIKE I FEEL LIKE TIFI IF I WAS JUST DOING IT BECAUSE I WANT TO BE LEAN AM NOT QUITE SURE IT WOULD HAVE HELD FOR SO LONG NO AND WE HAVE A GUESS THAT A WHOSE EPISODE HAS BEEN RECORDED FOR THIS PODCAST WHO RUNS AND EATING DISORDER CLINICK AT THE UNIVERSITY PENNSYLVANIA MEDICAL SCHOOL STUDYE'S BEEN SEETING DISORDERS AND ERECT E A O SEDY AND AND HE WILL GO ON RECORD AND OBE CITY AND HE WILL GO ON RECORD SAYING THAT THESE VERY HIGHLY PALATABLE PROCESS HIGH SUGAR FOODS OF THE SORT THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT AM DON'T UTS AND SO FORTH THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY DANGEROUS WRITE THAT THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF THE WAY THAT THEY ENGAGE NORAL CIRCUITURY HEAS ANOR O SURGEON THAT RESHAPE THE BRAIN IN DANGEROUS WAYS AND THOSE ARE HIS WORDS AND I TAK ANEMES S YEA NA IS ENEMENS I I THINK NOT S NIMENTS RI A YATHER COMING O WITH WHAT WE DON'T ATHEY CAN'T CATCH US AN SURI A IN ANY CASE A TO IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU DO EAT HOWDO STRUCTURE THAT AM IN TERMS OF WHEN YOU LOOK DOWN AT A PLATE YOU DONE THESE ESCRIBE THIS BEFORE BY THE IT'S JUST A BEAUTIFULLY SIMPLE DESCRIPTION CAUSE I THINK ALOVE PEOPLE DON'T WANTO TO CALLORY CANTING IN ALL THIS AND  YOU KNOW HODY HOW SHOULD PEOPLE THINK ABOUT WHAT TO EAT SO YEI I HAVE WHAT  LIKE WHAIKE CALL PLATE METHOD AND ITSIST IT JUST SIMPLE CAUSE IT WORKS FOR ME YOU KNOW A AND AND AGAIN IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING WITH A WITH REAL EATING ISSUES THESE THESE MECHANISMS BECOME I MIDDALLY LESS EFFECTIVE BECAUSE YOUR HAVING MAY BE AVER MOSTLY TRIGGERT EATING AND YOU CAN'T STOP AT ONE PLATE I MEAN THAT YOU COAN GET THE PLATE RIGHT BUT F THE PORTIONS ARE OUT O CONTROL PLATE I PLATE HAS A DEMENTINALITY OIA  WO VULTIBLE PLATES EA LI A SECOND THORD PLATE ILY RIGHT LIKE THEN  YOU KNOW ALL THESE THINGS CAN BE CHALLENGE BUT WHAT I WOAT I SAY IS A WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR PLATE THEN YOU JUST SIMPLY LOOK AT IT AS LIKE A A LIKE A CLOCK RIGHT AND A IF YOU JUST MAKE A NINE TWENTY ON THE CLOCK SO ONE ARM GOES OVER TO THE NINE AN ONE OF THE ARMS GOES OVER TO TWENTY WELL THEN YOU'RE BASICALLY YOU CAN TO TAKE THE THE SECOND LARGEST PORTION YOU KNOW OF THAT WHICH NN YU MAKE THE LINE TOWARDS TWELVE O'CLOCK TO AND THE LARGEST PORTIONS GOING TO BE YOUR FIBRIS CARBAYDRATES SO THAT'S THE THE THIING OF THE GREEN VEGETABLES I SO WHETHER BE BROKLY OR BRUSSELSPROUTS SIR SPARAGUS OR YOUKNOW YOU PICKURE PICK YOUR FAVORITES YOU KNOW LIKE THOSE OF THE ONES THAT GIVE US ALOW THAT MY COR NEWTRANE WE NEED THERE THE ONES THAT ARE GENERALLY YO EXCEPT IT AS MORE HEALTHY A AND THEY'RE ALL SOK IN TO PROBY THE FIBRER THAT'S GOING TO BE BOTH BENEFICIAL N TURMS OF ITS IN PACT ON INSOLENT AND ALL SO JUST THROUGH FILLING YOU UP RIGHT AND THEN I TAKE THE NEXT  LARGEST PORTION OF THAT AND I DEVOTE THAT TOORDS PROTINE AT AIN'S REALLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY FOR ANYBODY ACTIVE A THE MORE ACTIVE YOU ARE THE MORE YOU EMBARK ON TRYING TO BUILD MUSCLE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE PROATING EVERY MEAL SO I HAVE THAT AND AGAIN YOU O WERE TALKING CLEANER SOURCES OF PROTEEN BUT LIKE II'M YOU'LL NEVER FIND LIKE BOILED CHICKEN ON MY PLATE LIKE I DITCH THOSE DAYS WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN OR FIFTEEN OR SIXTEENLI I REALIZED AFTER READING THOSE BINABLE TY MAGAZINES THAT MAYBE THE LOW FAT THINGS STUCK FOR TOO LONG BUT THE ARE THE NO FAT THINGS STCK FOR TOO LONG BUT THE BOILED CHICKEN AND IN A YOU KNOW A A STEAM BROCK WE THING THAT ENDED QUICKLY FOR ME CAUSE EVER I'M I CANG TO EAT THIS FOR EVER SO I'LL HAVE SOME SORT OF FISH OR CHICKEN AND BUT THEYN'T IT WILL BE IT'LL BE COOKED IN A WAY THAT'S THAT'S LIKE YOU A'ST GOT MAYBE SOME SAUCONETERS GOT SOME MAYBES TOMATO SAW IT'S ANYTHING  JUST JUST MAKIT A LOBET MORE PALABLE INTERESTING WITHOUT BELOWING THE VALUE OF THE MEAL AND THEN THAT LAST PORTIONS WHERE I PUT MY STARCY CARBAHYDRATES AND AGAIN THAT'S THE PART THAT SOME PEOPLE SA EXCLUDE THEM ENTIRELY CAUSE A'RE NOT HEALTHY ER THEY DON'T WORK FOR YOU OR THER NOT THE ON BENEFICIAL LONG TERM FOR ME IT'S BEEN A GODSEND AND AND I DO THINK I'M LIKE MOST PEOPLE MY BODY CRAVES THOSE CARBAHYDRATES I CHOOSE THINGS LIKE SWEEP POTATOES WHICH IS MY FAVOR IT YOU OR I'LL HAVE A RASE SIR I'LL HAVE PASTA IM A MATALIANS SO I LIKE PASTA AND LIKE I WILL HAVE THOSE THINGS OF NOT EXCLUDING THEM BUT I DON'T PUT THEM IN THE PORTIONS YOU OULD GENERALLY FIND A YOU KNOW MY WIFE AND I WILL GO OUT AN D WILL GO THE RESTAURANT ITSOMETIMES LIKE BECAUSE WE TRAVEL A QUITE A BIT OR USED TO LEASE WITH BASEBALL TO THERE'S A CHEESECAKE FACTERE OF WHERE YOU WENT AND I LOVE CHEESECAKE FACTORY BUT LIKE THE WAY THEY STRUCTURE MEALS IS IT'S ALL RICE ON THE BOTTOM AND AL'LD TE CHICKEN ON TOP AND I MEAN IT'S A PLATEFUL OF RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULDN'T FIND ME MAKE A PLATE THAT WAY I'ML GOG TO JUST DEVOTE THAT PORTION ON THE PLATE TO THE STRUCTY CARBAHYDRATE AND SO IT GIVES ME A LITTLE BIT MORE RESPONSIBILITY AN TERNS O PORTION CONTROL CAUSE THOSE ARE THE FOODS A AGAIN PROBABLY YOU DON'T MEEN DRIVEN THAT ARE MOST EASILY OVER EATEN I ALWAYS ASKED THE QUESTION HAW WAS LOST TIME TO EIGHT TEN CHICKEN BREAST AT A MEAL LIKE YOU'RE GTTING SICK OF IT AFTER MAYBE TWO OR THREE BUT YOU COULD EAT A WHOLE HULL ALOT OF CARBAHYDRATES STARCHY CARBAHYDRATES BECAUSE THE THEYRE JUST SO SATISFYING AND I THINK THOSE TRIGGERS AS YOU SAID TO WANT MORE LIKE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS RIGHT YOU JUST KEEP YOU EVEN WHE YOU'REFEELING FULL YOU WANT MORE A AND THAT'S THE BIGGEST DANGER TO CARBAHYDRATE SO IF YOU CAN DEVELOP SOME SORT OF TIS A PLIN AROUND THEM AM THEN YOU CAN STILL ENJOY THEM IF YOU CAN'T DEVELOP THAT DISCIPLINE A FOR WHATEVER REASON THAN MAYBE THEY DO BECOME SOMETHING TO HAVE TO WORK YOURSELF AROUND OR OR A DOPTED TO FOR NEING STYLE AND AS I SAID I'M NEVER TO THE POINT WHERE I'M NOT TRYING TO BE DOGMATIC AN MY APPROACH I'M ALWAYS TRYIN TO SAY THIS IS HOW I DO IT AND I'M AND I'M A BELIEVER IN IT JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE'S BELIEVER IN THEIR METHOD BUT I'M OPEN TO THE IDEA THAT SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR YOU AND GETS YOU TO A AA HEALTHIER WEIT AN A SUSTAIN ABILITY LIKE THAT IS GOOD THAT'S IT'S GOOD FOR ME YOU ON' PROVIDED DOESN'T INTROINTRODUCE OTHER OTHER ISSUES YOU KNOW YETS SOMETHING ONE CAN DO CONSISTENTLY THAT'S ONLIYG I PICKED UP FROM YOU A OVER THE YEARS YOU KNOW WHAT CAN YOU DO CONSISTENTLY AND FOR ME THAT ALSO MEANT WHAT WHEN AND HOW CAN I EAT WHAT CAN I EAT CONSISTENTLY THAT WILL ALSO ALLOW ME TO BE ALERT AFTER LUNCH LIKE CAN ASHON GET SOME WORKD ON YE A WOR EAT I LIKE TO TRAIN FASTED IN THE MORNING BUT I DON'T DO ANY LONG TURN FASTING JUST SO HAPPENS THAT I'M FINE DOING A WATERING CAFIN IN THE MORNING AND A TRAINING IN THE MORNING AND THEN THAT YOU MIGHT FORST MEAL AFTERWARDS IT JUS BUT I GET CARBIDRATES AT NIGHT SO MI LIKE AGEN IN SRE RIGTERS SORT I I THINK CARPIDRATES ARE WONDERFUL I JUST DON'T EAT THEM AN EXCESS SO TO ME IT' I I FEEL LIKE WHEN WHAT YOU DESCRIBE AS A VERY RATIONAL LITERALLY BALANCE TO PROACH A AN OBVYOU SEY THERE WILL BE VARIATIONS FOR PEOPLE WHOAR DEALING WITH O BECITY OR DIBETES OR YOU KNOW I I'VE GOT FRIENDS THERE ON THE THE PURE CARNIVOR THING I'VE FRIENDS THAT AR VEGAN AND IM IT'S ALWAYS IMPRESSIVE TO ME WHEN SOMEBODY CAN A STICK TO ANYTHING CONSISTENTLY BE'S I EXCEPT WHEN THERE'E TICKING TO JUST POOR BEHAVIOR R ASNHT THERE'S NOTHING IMPRESSIVE ABOUT THAT AWI THINK THAT THAT'S VERY HELPFUL IM BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S FOR THE TIPICAL LISTENER OF THIS PODCAST EATER THE ONLINE CONTENT THAT PEOPLE SEE THE BATTLES ARE VERY CONFUSING THE THE'RE DISTRACTING I JUST PEOPLE REALLY THINK ALL THAT THERE'S A RIGHT WAY IN A WRONG WAY AND IT'S IT SOUNDS LIKE THE WAY THAT ONE CAN AM EAT CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME THAT'S HEALTHY AUM CERTAINLY FEWER PROCESS IN SUGARY FROODS I THING  ALMOST LIKE W EVERYBODY ELSE  YE AMOST EVERYONE AGREES ON THAT RIGHT SO I I THINK IT IS AT IT'S IT'S A IT'S CALARY MANIPULATION THROUGH SOME OTHER METHOD I SO EVEN EVEN  INTIMATE FASTING LIKKING LIKE HE SAID LIKE I THAT CAN BE IT'S IT'S FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE GRAZERS LIKE IF YOU ARE A GRAZER AND YOUR REAL PROBLEM IS PORTION CONTROL OVER THE COURSE OF THE DAY BUT YOU CAN RESPOND TO A RULE THAT SAYS NO  YOU'RE EATING BETWEEN HERE AND HERE THAT YOU CAN OBEY THAT RULE WELL YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BEAL THE GRAZE DURING THE TIMES THAT YOU MIGHT BE DOING ADDITIONAL DAMAGE SO A SURE THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S OTHER HORMONAL BENEFITS THAT PEOPLE WILL TALK ABOUT FROM THAT APPROACH BUT FROM A LONGEVITY STANDPOINT AND HABIT FORMING STANDPOINT IF IT'S FIXING THE HABIT THAT YOU'RE BREAKING TOO OFTEN BY EATING THROUGHOUT WHENEVER YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WALK BY FOOD AM IT'S GOOD THE OLIN AT WORKS AND AGAIN THET ITS IT'S IT'S THE A PEOPLE CAN WILL TELL YOU YOU CAN PROBABLY EAT WHATEVER YOU WANT AT EAT AS LONG AS YOU'RE EATING WITHIN THOSE THAT WINDOW BUT I THINK THEM M RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE WHOR PRACTICIONERS OF THAT WILL SAY NO YOU STILL WANT AVOID PROCESS SUGAR AND IN  THINGS LIKE THAT SO A AND THAS IS THE MECHANISM OF EATING NOT REALLY A DIET RIHT BUT LIKE IT'S IT'S I THINK THAT PEOPLE I I HATE A I HATE TO BE AS LIKE AS AS BASIC AS AS IT SOUNDS WITH THAVE WHAT IS FOR THE EXACT REASON THAT IF IT'S THAT TWENTY THREE HOUR DAY PHENOMENON THAT'S LIKE YOU KNOW YOU SAID YOU'RE IMPRESSED IT IS IMPRESSIVE YOU NOW IT'S SO HARD TO CONTROL ALL OF OUR BEHAVIOURS IN FOOD BEING ONE OF THE HARDEST THING O A BIGGEST TEMPTATIONS FOR PEOPLE YOU'L LEARN HOW TO CONTROL THAT FOR SO LONG AND THEN DO IT DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY A WHATEVER THAT MECHANISM IS THAT WORKS FOR YOU IT IS IS IMPRESSIVE IN IM IN AN AMA ANAMA I'M I'M A BELIEVER IN IT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S THE THAT'S THAT'S HOW I FEEL I FILL IT PEOPLE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE GIVEN SOME RAINS TO BE ABLE TO THE DEFIND WA WORKS FOR THEM WELL I LOVE TO EAT IN ONE OF THE BEAUTIES OF WAY TRAINING AS I FEEL LIKE I CAN EAT PLENTY FOR MY AGE AND I'M NOT AS LEAN AS YOU ARE BUT I'M 'M A HAPPY WITH WERAMAT CA ALWAYS DO BETTER YOU KNOW HEA YHEER A SHAG OF GETTING BETTER A PROBLEC AS AM MEATING CLEANER A AS I 'LL SO AVE SO ON A COOK FOR ME NOW AND WE NO LIKE HELP AND WE LIKI HAVE THAT I HAE THAT TAND WE LIKE HEALTHY FOOD AND SO WERE VERY FORTUNE I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY PACKAGE FOOD IN OUR HOME WE MUST TARTOF MAKING SOUR CROWD AT HOME I DON'T MAKE IT AS SHE MAKES IT WELO WE MY WIFE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW SHE SHE A TURN ME ON TO A TIPITACTL SHARED WITH WITH THE WHOLE CHANNEL WHICH WAS LIKE YOU CAN YOU CAN GO TO A WE HAVE A STO LEONARDS AROUND OUR OR BIC PEGROCIOU STORE CHAIN AROUND US AND THEY HAVE A CATER IN DEPARTMENT AND THE OTHER OFTEN USE FOR CATERING BI PARTIES AN YO BIG TUBS OF O OF GIRL CHICKEN BUT LIKE REALLY GOOD GREAL CHICKEN AGAIN NOT THE BOILED CHICKEN BUT YOUR BIG TUVS OF SWEE POTATOES AND WE'LL THEWE'LL GET BUNCH OF THOSE AND SHALL GO OVER A SHALL GETN THIT SHAL SORT OF ARRANGE YE OF THEM ON PLATES AND PUT THE PLATES IN AND LIKE I'M O CAY WITH PREPETITIVE EATING I THINK MORE PEOPLE OR PROBABLY OCY WITH REPETIVENG THAN THEY THINK I THINK THAT WEN YOU ACTUALLY BREAK DOWN HOW MANY DIFFERENT BREAKFAST VARIETY IK VERATIONS YOU HAT THREE TO TO R  HAVESOMEEM SO LIK I THINK WHEN PEOPLE DO THIS MORE VARIETY FOR DINNER PROBABLY BUT LIKE YOU EVEN THERE YOU PROBABLY T FIVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DINNERS TO KNOVER THE COURSE OF YOU KNOW A WEEK ER A MONTH WELL YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE THAT ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THE THINGS THAT YOU LIKE AND AGAIN NO PLAN IS GET A WORK IF YOU'R EATING STUFFY DON'T LIKE IT'S NOCKINGTO WORK FOR EVER NOTHING WILL YOU HAVE TO REALLY ENJOY WERE YOUR RETING AS LONG AS THESE THESE A VARIATIONS OF THIS MEAL OR SOMETHING YOU REALLY ENJOY IN THERE ARE LIMITINVERSIONS OF THEM THE REPRODUCE ABILITY OF THAT IS SIMPLE YOU KNOW IT WELL TAKE SOME TIME BUT IF YOUR FORTUNE ENOUGH IN OUR CASE TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO CAN PREPARE IT FOR YOU NOW THAT'S EVEN PAR OUT OF THE EQUATION YOU KNOW AND IT'S IT'S IT'S LIKE IT IT JUST MAKES IT VERY SIMPLE BUT I DO THINK WEN YOU TALLY UP ALL THE COSTS OF MEDICAL CARE THATAR THATARS THAT AR SPI KED BY HAVING POOR NUTRITION AND YOU THEN OFF SET THAT BY WHAT IT MIGHT COST YOU TO INVEST IN A FASTER STRATAGY LIKE THIS CATERING TRICK OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE YOU BE BEST OFF FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT MAY BE REALICATE SOME OF YOUR MONEY THA PREPARING THIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW HOW POR IS TERE LONG TURN HEALTH AN IN LONGEVITY IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT YOUR NUTRITION ISSUES OF EVERY ONE LISTEN TO SPOCKAS CAN FIGURE OUT THEIR NUTRITION ISSUES THIS WHOLE WOR BE DIFFERENT THAT IS LIKE  WHAT O LARGEST SOURCES OF DISEASE AND IN PAIN IND DISCOMFORT BECAUSE PEOPLE REALY STRUGGLEIN NUTRITION YAND IS IT IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM N IN HE OL YOU SEE IT ISNAN EPIDEMIC IN THE CANTRY OM VERY VERY SERIOUS I'M ALSO A LOT OF POLY PROCESSFUDES ARE AR MORE EXPENSIVE THAN HEALTHY WHEN YOU REALLY RIGHT RAKE I DOWN A EVEN NOT EVEN THE BETTER SOURCE I HIGH QUALITY FLODS ARE RIKT THERE ON PAR LESS THAN A THE PROCESS FOODS  FOR SURE A I BUT COUPLE OTHER QUESTIONS AS IT RELATES A TO TRAINING A BECAUSE I THINK THAT ONE ONE THING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WONDER ABOUT  MAY BE WE COULD DO THIS AN KIND OF A TRUE FALSE A METHOD A FORSATE JUST TO GET THROUGH SOME OF THESE O IF AT RIHT IT LEAST AT EXACTLY AM MEN AND WOMEN SHOULD TRAIN DIFFERENTLY THE SCIENCE OF IT WILL SAY FALSE A THE AND AGAIN NOT NOT TO GENERALIZE BUT COUNT OF THE POINT YOU TOUCHED ON EARLIER TO DAY I DO FIND THAT CASUALLY INTERESTED WOMEN IN TRAINING WELL MIGRATE MORE TOWARD CERTAIN TYPES OF FITNESS LIKE KICK BOXING LIKE DANCING LIKE YOU KNOW LOW REST CIRCUIT I YE YE YE AND AND I THINK AGAIN WHATEVER T IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ENGAGE IN REGULARLY IT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO PHYSIOLOGICALLY KNOW AND I THINK IF IF IF WE CAN GET MORE WOMEN TO FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IN THE GIM PERFORMING THE SAME EXERCISES THE SAME A IN RECEIVING THE SAME STRAIN TRAINING BENEFITS IN WORKING ON PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD AND LIKE THE AND WE HIT THE HOLY GRAIL BUT I THINK THAT  IT'S A IT'S A A BIG BRIDGE THAT HAS TO BE GAPPED STILL BECAUSE A YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST SOME REALITY TO LISTEN THAT THERE ARE VERY MY WIFE IT IS A PERF EXAMPLE THIS LEAVE LIVING A VERY COMPLICATED BUSY LIFE A WE HAVE TWO YOUNG BOYS THERE THEIR TWINS AND  HER HER ATTENTION AND FOCUS IS THERE YOU KNOW AND IT'S LIKE SHE SHE DOESN'T DO THIS FOR A LIVING LIKE I DO AND IF SHE CAN GET A DECENT WORK OUT AND SHE'S HAPPY YOU KNOW BUT SHE'S NOT NECESSARILY WORKING ON HER DEAD LIFT PIAR YOU KNOW AND SO I THINK THAT THAT WOULD HELP HER AND SERVE HER IN THE LONG TERM TO WORK ON INCREASING HER HER PIARE'S AND DIFFERENT LIFTS IN BUILDING HER STRENGTH PROGRESSIVELY BUT IOU KNOW   IN HER LIFE RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT NECESSIILY IN THE CARDS TO HAVE THE TIME THE FOCUSS ON THAT SO WOULD YOU THEN DISCOURAGE YOU KNOW THIS OTHER THING THAT SHE MIGHT FIND INTERESTING LIKE SOME A BOXING YOU KNOW WHA THERE THERE'S A LITTLE A I REMEMBER THE BRAN BUT LIKE ONE OF THOSE PUNCHABLE BOXING A STAND UP THINGS HELAND SHE ENJOYS IT YOU KNOW AND UM YOU KNOW IK ANYTHING TO GET TO GET YOU MOVING IS GOING TO BE PREFERABLE BUUT DON'T THINK THAT NECESSARILY PHYSIOLOGICALLY THE THES DIFFERENCE YOU STARE WAIHT TRAIN PRETTY YOUNG YUM UTII I NEST AROUND WE KNOW WITH MY BROTHER CAUSE YOU WAS OLDER IN OUS FOR YOURS OLDER SAUCE KIN NESTING AROUND A WAIGS PROBABLY TWELL OR THIRTEEN WITH THE FIVE POUND DONBO OK YET YOU HEAR THAT A YOUNG KID SHOULDNT WORK OUT WITH THE WAIGHTS I DON'T KNOWHT THE GOING A STANDARD IS NOW THEY SAY YOU SHUTS DOWN LONG BONE GROTH OR A GROWTH PLATES SH YOU KNOW AT THIS SORT OF THING I YOU GOT TO YOUNG BOYS DOORABLE KITS BY THE WAY YE I WANTER THAT WHEN THE THINGS THAT IS IS VERY A HEART WORMING IS TO SEE IT YOU'RE IN GREAT SHAVE ECY EXTREMELY BRIGHT YOU KNOW YOUR CRAFT YOU LOVE YOUR CRAFT I YOU WORK WIT JESSE WHO O WILL TALK ABOUT US WELL AM THIS GR YOU KNOW WHICH IS GREAT YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S A COMEROTTER E THERE AND TE HAVING GREAT TEEN MATES SPART OF A BUSINESS R OR TO WORK OUT T IS JUST MAKES LIKE BETTER LET US BE HONEST I'M  GREATEFUL TO HAVE GREAT TEA MATES FROR THE POCKATS AND MY LAB OF COURSE AS WELL UM BUT UM TO SEE YOUR BOYS AN YOUR DOGS AND TET THE WHOLE PICTURE YOU KNOWITS ITS A YOU KNOW I'M SURE IT HAS AT A LOT OF O CONTOERS IN COMPLEXY THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT IN SHOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT BUT IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE AND UM E WILL THEY WAIT TRAIN I'VE SEEN THE VIDOS OF I WONDER BOTH OF THEM HAN FROM THE BARS KIS AND NATURALS A'LL TELLING YO II DON'T  WONDER WHERE THEY GET I DON'T IVN INOW I DON'T EVEN ENCOURAGE T I' NOT GIV YOU THE DAD WHO SIT IN THERE A SAY LET'S GO SOMEWHER YA WE ARE TWO DAYS YERE I LOTK IN  NOTKING TO DO THAT BUT THEY THEY HAVE AA NATURAL INTEREST IN THE JIM THEY TO SOMETIMES LIKE TO BE OUT WITH DADDY SO THE COME OUT THERE AND YOU KNOW I I OF THE TWO OF US MY WIFE AND I WILL BE THE ONE WHO HAS A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A LONGER LEASE TO LET THEM EXPLORE THINGS CAUSE I WAS A A DONE ME AT TIMES TO AND FIGURED OUT BEST THROUGH THE MISTAKES I ERINJURY E GOT DIDN'T NORSINCE WE CALL THAT ONE TRAVEL LERN VER NOW WHANT O THESE GUIES RBE MASTERS OF ONE TRO LEARNING BECAUSE O NO THER'LL GO GRAB  YEOHT THE THE BARS OF MY THE HANDLES OF MY JAMMER THENS THERE  AT LOWER LEVEL TOR THEM AND THERE'S SWINING AROUND OR DON'T PULL UPS OT AT NATURALLY UNCOACH NOTHING FROM ME AM ONILL WALK UP TO A TET LIVE BAR STAND OVER AN NATURALLY NEVER SAW ME DO IT STANDS OVER THERE LISCAUS RISLY A TRIES TO PULL ITSO THERE'S AT THERE'S A DEAFILY AN INCLINATION TO LIKING THE JIM AND I WILL SO FULLY SUPPORT THAT BUT OF COURSE AYOU KNOW BODY IT WILL BE GOOD FOR QUETTL I SO WHAT AGT YOU THINK IS REASONABLE FOR KIS TO START EXPLORING A NON BODY WEIGHT A YO THINK AROUND THIRTEEN I THING AROUT THIRTEEN ONCE PUBITY I THINK IT' SO KAY TO START TO AM YOU KNOW CAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH I EVEN SAY FOR PEOPLE THAT AE LIKE  LATER AN AGE WHO ARE JUST STARTING OUT LEARN WITH YOUR OENBODY WI FIRST TUS PLENTY OF RESISTANCE TO BE HAD BY LEARNING HOW TO COMMAND YOUR BODY IN SPACE SO IF YOU HAVE NEVER TRAINE BEFORE YOU GOING TO GET VERY STIMULATED BY DOING LUNGING AND REVERSE LUNGEON EVEN LEARNING SOME APPROPRIATE CEPTION AROUND MOVEMENT THROUGH SPACE PULL UPS CHIN UPS BOTH TO CHEMPS O CHALLENGING FOR EVEN PEOPLE HAVE HAD TWENTY THIRTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE GIM SO THERE'S A LOT OF STIMULUS TO BE HAD BY BODY WAY AND JUMPING STRAIGHT TO DUNBELLS OR BARBELLS IS ACTUALLY DOING YOURSELF AT TO SERVICE YOU CAN LEARN BETTER COMMAND OF YOUR BODY IN SPACE SO WE GO BACK TO THE BIGGER LIVES A YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AT EASIER TIME SORT OF PROGRESSIVELY LOADING THEM IN BUILDING UP THAT TFOUNDATION OF STRENGTH I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU HAVE TO BECOME A MASTER CALOSTACS APPLYC BEFORE YOU CAN TOUCH OF BARBELL THAT'T NOT EVEN TRUE I'M JUST SAYING THERE'S SO MUCH CAPACITY KIDS ORE TO BE DOING THIS ANYWAY  REALLY JUST IF YOU LOOK AT GENERAL PLAY THEY ARE JUMPING THY ARE LUNGING THEY ARE CLIVING THEY ARE PULLING I THAT'S WHAT THEY DO AN KNOW SO A WHY I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE AVOIDINGSOF LIKE STRUCTURE TRAINING IS FOR YOUNGER KIDS AGAIN PRO BI THEIR USING BODYWAIGHT MAY BE A YOU LESS BOLISTIC MOVEMENTS SOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU THINGS TARE IN TH ER OR CERTAINLY OVERLOADED MOVEMENTS A I THNKG WE SHAN NCOURAGE KIDS TO DO MORE THERE'S A LOT OF A OBISIAN AN KIDS ON THE RISE ALSO AND THAT'S INCREDIBLY THE ODISCONCERTING TO ME SO I THINK IN IM AND I HOPE IT DOESN'T COME FROM THE ADVICE OF SOME THAT SAY WILL WAIT UNTIL YOUR OLDER TO START DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT'S A WAY WORSE TRAIDED OFF HAN THEN THEN ENGAGING SOMETHING SMART NOW WE SEE GET KICKED OUT OF THE HOUSE WHEN WNG YOURE KID TOTALLY MY MOMA KICK US OUT I O O I TA HUGE PACK OF BOYS A LIVE ON MY STREET YOU KNOW  BUT WE GET KICKED OUT SIDE I WD LIVE LONG Y R NOT ALOUT IN TH I NO TELL OF IM  THERE RE VIDIO GAMES OF COURSE BUT WE WERE WEWERE KICKED OUT OF THE HOUSE WE HAD TI LIKE FURST TO ESCAPE WORDING SOCKER AND THEN WE YOU KNOW WE'D FIND OUR TROUBLE I A SO AM POST TRAINING NUTRITION WERE THE SAME AGE A YEARS AGO I SORT OF NEURADIC ABOUT THE IDEA THAT I HAD TO INJUST A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CARBOHIDRATES AMPROACHINGS WITHIN TWO HOURS THAN IT WAS NINETY MINUTES OF TRAININ I CONFESS I GET IF I TRAIND HARD SOMETIME BY THE RESISTANCE TRAINING NOT THE RUNNING BUT THE RESISTANCE TRAINING YOU SIXTY TO NINETY MINUTES LATER UNREALLY HUNGRY BUT THER'RE BEEN DAS WHEN I JUST SKIPIN THEN THE HUNGER PASSES IN THE LATER I EAT I EAT MORE I MIGHTY TWICE AS MUCH LATER O OV THAT TAT US THE WAST SOMETIMES CAT UALLS GO BUT  WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS AN TERMS OF THE THE NUTRICIAN SINS THE TRAIN THE TRAINING RELATED EFFECTS OF A THE POST TRAINING MEAL IS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU TRY TO TO GET IS IT SOMETHING YOU THINK PEOPLE SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO A SO THAT THAT SCIENCE IS ACTUALLY PROBABLY BEEN THE THE ONE THAT'S CHANGE THE MOST IN MY LIFETIME HONESTLY BECAUSE I I I GAIN WERE THE SAME AGE AND I WAS AFALLING FOR THE SAYNG A TRAP YOU WERE I WOULD REALLY EFOLKISTILY I'M I'MS I'M RISKING SPEEDING TICKETS DRIVING HOME FROM THE GIM NO GE GER I GOTTER IN TH BOLIC WINDOW YOU KNOWI I I DID ALL THA I REALLY DID  YO BUT A THANKFULLY THAT'S BEEN SORT OF DEBUNCT AN IN YOUR BODY IT ISN'T JUST RUSHING THROUGH YOU KNOW THESE CERTAIN PERIODS OF TIME TO YOU TO LIVES THE NEW TRICES IN OUR BODYBURE ABLE TO PARTICION THEM AND USE THEM OVER ALONG MUCH GREATER DURATION UP TO NOW THER' SAYING Y OF THREE TO FOUR HOURS AFTER TRAINING FIVE HOURS UP TO TRAIN YOU GUN STILL SEE THE UNTHE BENEFITS OF OF REPLENISHMENT ALLA THAT IS JUST YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S A CONSISTENCY ELEMENT TO IT AM THAT JUST UTILIZING A POSTWORK OUT WINDOW OR A POSTWORK OUT MEAL EVEN WF ITS WITHIN TWO HOURS OR ONE OUT IS JUST IN GRINING THE HABIT OF SAYING LISAND I JUST DID THIS ACTIVITY AND NOW WANT A REPLENISH SOME OF WHAT I LOST THE ENERGY THAT I USED TO PERFORM THE OTHER THE EXERCISE THAT I DID AND JUST GETTING INTO THE RUTINE KNOWING THAT THE THE ENGINE IS ULTIMATELY FED BY WHAT WE PUT IN IT AND THE CONCEPT OF REPLENISHING THE FUEL LOST IS STILL A CONCEPT THAT I THINK AGAIN DIFFERENT IN MECHANISM BUT STILL IN PORTING IN TERMS OF FUELING YU OVER ALL PERFORMANCE SO THE OTHER THE THE PREWORK OUT PERIOD OF TIME GIVES US A CHANCE TO ACTUALLY HAVE A LONGER WINDOW BECAUSE OF THAT IF THOSE NEUTRIANS ER ARE OBTAINED PREWORK OUT IT'S NOT LIKE THEIR GOIN IN THAT HOUR THAT YOUV TRAINED THERE'S STILL THERE IN AVAILABLE FOR YOUR BODY USE SO YOU I THINK IT'S IMPORTAN TO GET ONE OF THE TWO WE ON'T WRITER AT LEAST MAKE SURE YOU'RE YOURE CONSISTENTLY OF IT A AHAVING ONE OR THE TWO OR YOU MIGHT RISK GOING THROUGH ALL THESE PERIODS OF OF HAVING NO NUTRITION TO SUPPORT YOUR EFFORTS NOT ONLY WE WORK OUTSPOTENTIALLY SUPPER AND TURNS TO THE OUTPUT BUT THEN YOU'RE ALSO NOT PROVIDING YOUR BODING ANY ABILITY TO CAPITALIZE ON ON A AND OPPORTUNITY TO FEET IT AND REFUEL AND RECOVER SO IM I'M NOT VERY DOGMATIC ABOUT WHAT SPECIFICALLY TO TO EAT PREE OR POST WOON'T WORK OUT BUT I DO THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE PROTENE A SURROUNDING YOURE YOUR TRAINING WHETHER THAT BE HEAD OF TIME OR AFTER PROACINE COULD BE A LITTLE BIT HARD TO DIGEST FOR SOME PEOPLE SO IF YOU DO THAT PREWORK OUT IN THEN YOUR FINDING YOUR WORK OUT SWOGGING BECAUSE YOU DON'T FEEL GOOD TAN SONLY YOU PUT THAT AFTER YOUR MEAL BUT THIS WHOLE CONCEPT OF THE URGENCY OF TIME AS THANKFULLY BEEN REMOVED AN WE CAN JUST LEARN TO EAT A LITTLE BIT MORE A MO RESPONSIBLY IN DRIVE MORE RESPONSIBLY SO WERE NOT YOKNOW TRYING TO RUSH HOME FROM THE GIMMIN RISK YON KILLING PEOPLE ON THE WAY YOU KNOW I I THINK I THINK IT'S A BUT I THINK IT'S GREAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT JUST SHOW CASES OF BELIEF THAT PEOPLE HAD FOR SO LONG THAT HAS SINCE BEEN PROVING TO BE NOT THAT IMPORTANT AND THERE'S IT THERE'S A THERE'S A TIP OF THE CAP TOWARDS RESEARCH IN A GOOD WAY WHEREITS LIKE ER I I THINK WE COULD ALL AGREE THAT THIS ISN'T NECESSARILY TRUE ANY MORE AM AND LOOK OT YOURSELF AND SAY OH MY GOT I DID THAT SO OFF I I  BIT THATLONT OL FIN A THINKER BUT A BUT THEN REALIZE THAT CANIT WE COULD ALWAYS MAKE A CHANGE AND THE GOOD THING ABOUT NUTRITION IS THOSE CHANGES CAN HAPPEN THE VERY NEXT TIME YOU GO TOE OWING YOU'LL SUC TO SEE THE BENEFITS OF THAT SO I'M A I'M I'M NOT A BEG BELIEVER IN THAT STRICT APPROACH TO PRE OR POST WORK OUT AM MN EVEN AS FAR AS PREWORK OUT SUPPLEMENTS A LO PEOPLE DON'T TAKE A LO PEOPLE DON'T LIKE HEM THAY'N'T TAKE THEM THEY DON'T LIKE THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY EVEN BEING USED AS THE NUNUTRITIVE SIDE OF THE PREWORK OUT THEY'RE JUST MORE NEW USE TO FUEL THE WORK OUT OM STOM FOR ME IT'S A WATER IN O'M SOME FORM OF CAFINE YE I MEAN IT'S IT WHATEVER YU KNOW AGAIN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I DO THING IS IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL ATOU'T PUT SO IF YOURE PREWORK INETRICIAN REQUIRES A STIMULA NOR TO HELP YOU DO THAT OR IF YOU PRERORK NUTRITION IS CAUSING YOU TO HAVE A HARDER TIME THE TRAIN BECAUSE YOUR FEELING FULL OR STOMACH TAKE OR SOMETHING ELSE THAN N THAT THAT'S NOT ACHIEVING WHAT U TRYING TO DO THE ULTIMATE GOL IS TO STILL BE ABLE PERFORM AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL SO  WHAEVER YOU NUTRICION IS REQUIRE TIL LI IS STILL DO THAT THAT IS PY THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR OF ALL OF IT RIGT I LOVE THE VERY CLEAR AND RATIONAL PROACH DON'T INJEST ANYTHING RIGHT BEFORE YOUR WORK OUT OR NEAR YOURE WORK OUT THAT'S GOING TO MAKE YOUR WORK OUT WORSE SO AN  EVEN HAN IT'S SO SIMPLE AND YET YOU DON'T HEAR THATS BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE THINK O THEY MUST HAVE A PREWORK AT THEY MUST HAVE A PUTOE  AGAIN I OVEN IF THE'RE THE THE BENEFITS THAT ARE TO BE HAD FROM WHATEVER'S BEING SUGGESTED IS GOIN TO BE EASILY OFFSET BY THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T PERFORM AT AN OUT PUT CAPABLE OF DRIVING ANY CHANGE SO THAT THAT WOULD PI PROMUSTNGAIT THE FACT THAT THE'R KNOW THERE'S NO YOU'RE NOT OUT WEIGHING THOSE BENEFITS OF WHATEVER NUTRUTR TO REPROACHI TUG BUT ENS TO STRUGGLING FOR YOUR WORK OUT O FOR ME THE BEST PREWORK OUT IS A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP HIDRATION CAFFINE MUSIC EOMI  THEY WORS  FORMERLYAN IWORKS AND THE POS WHERE I DO I DO FIND I  GET QUITE HUNGRY ING WONE YOU QUITE A BIT MORIN AND ELLAS A NATURAL RESPONSE THE BODY'S GOING TO IN MOST PEOPLE WANT TO DO THAT AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE FET I WORK OUT AS YOUY AGAIN LOT OF MY POSTINGS ON ISTER GRAM WILL HAPPIN AT TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT TEN THIRTY AT NINE ELEVEN A NIGHT AS I AM ACTUALLY TRAINING THERE AND THAT'S FOR I'M TAKING THOSE LITTLE BREAKS IN BETWEEN SATSTACTUALLY FILM OR POST SOMETHING BUT LIK I THEN GO INSIDE AHT DINNER SO I'M EATING AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT NO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY IDEAL ON THAT RECONMENDING THATAS A TOOL FOR ANYBODY I THINK IT DISPELLS ONE THING I'VE NEVER BEEN A BELIEVER AND CAN IT CARVES AFTER SIX  NO I MAKES IN O SENSE TO ME YOU'RE SAST ON ALL THE NEW ALLL THE SINE OF MATABOLISM THAT I'VE SEEN RINESS I THINK AS LONG AS YOU CAN SORVE LIKE NAPPING I TALK TO MAT WALKER ONE OF THE GREAT SLEEP RESEARCHERS WROTE WHY WE SLEEP ET CETERAE YOU KNOW AN AS IS DONT PARCASTS ABOUT SLEEP TREMENDOUS RESEARCH R PUBLIC COMMUNICATOR ABOUT SLEEP EN HE SAID YOUR NAPS ARE FINE PROVIDED THEY DON'T INTERRUPT YOUR ABILITY TO SLEEP WELL AT NIGHT RIGHT SIMPLE  O ME WHEN SLEEP FROM EIGHT TO NINE P M AND THEN GO TO BED AT MIDNIGHT AND NOT A PROBLEM OTHER YOU WLL TAKE A THIRTY MENUTE NAP AFTER LUNCH AND THEY

ANY REMEMBER EITHER BEGAN EXACTLYI I I A I THIYK IF PEOPLE COULD IF IF IF WE HAD ONE GIFT WE COULD GIVE TO EVERYBODY WOULD BE THE LOVE OF FITNESS FOR IF THEY COULD BE BESTOWED THE LOVE OF FITNESS O WOULD CHANGE THE ENTIRE WORLD YOU KNOW BUT I THINK WHEL YOU HEAR THINGS LIKE THIS THAT LIKE HE THAT WILL WORK AND THAT WILL WORK TOO AND THAT THIS WILL WORK TO YOU RATHER THAN THE DOGMATIC ONE WAY

CONTENT I WE WOULD BE REMISS IF WE DIDN'T AM DISBRIEFLY DISCUSS A JESSE AM ONE OF THE GREAT PLEASURES FROM ME AND IN WATCHING YOUR CONTENT AND LEARNING FROM IT OVER THE EARS AS THAT YOU TOOK ON A YOU DECIDE TO MENTER SOMEBODY AM JESSE AND THERE'S A THERE SOME POKING FON BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU WHICH IS VERY AMUSING BUT HAVE TO SAY IT INSPIRED ME TO DO SOMETHING A EARLY ON ENDEVELOPING THIS PODCAST AS I HAVE A A YOUNG IN TURN WHO AM HAS HELPED ME WITH SOME OF THE RESEARCH AND HE'S A BUTTIND HE'S INTEREST IN SCIENCE HE'S ABOUT TO GO OFF TO COLLEGE BUT HE ELS GOT REALLY INTO FITNESS WE WATCH THE IT HE AS OF YOU GUISE HE WAS HELPING ME GET THE INSTRAGRAM CONTENT OUT EARLY ON AND ONE THING THAT AS JUST IT WAS  SUCH A PLEASURE TO BE ABLE TO PASS ALONG KNOWLEDGE AND AND OF COURSE I'M LEARNING FROM HIM THE ISES IS ALWAYS THE WAY IT WORK I LEARN WHAT IR TEACHING WE LEARNE FROM STUDENTS A BUT IT'S BEEN GREAT TO SEE JESSE'S PROGRESS THAT'S AMAZING  GETTIN MEET HIM IN PERSON A JUST NOW AND AND I HE'S HE HAS GROWN HE'S CHANGED PHYSICALLY AND AND I THINK THAT YOU MENTION A LOVE OF FITNESS I THINK THAT IN IT ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO BE CONSISTENT IS TO TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF TEACHING OTHERS ONE S ONE HAS PROFICIENCY AND SO I THINK SO AM MAY YOU JUST TELL US A LOPIT ABOUT HOW THAT'S GOING HOW OWAS JESSE DOING AND AM WERE WERE WHERE DOES HE NEE O MORE WORK WHEREIS HE THRIVING A I'M IMPRESSED BY THE PROGRESS WILL WE HAVE BE PHYSICALLY WE CAN HAVE IS SE SEE THETHETHE CHANGE S IN THE LIST OF THINGS TO WORK ON OR IS IS IMMENSE IS SO LONG FOR HIM TO CONTAIN IM PROVE BUT NO ACTE YOU KNOW IN REALITY JESSE THE STORY OF JESSE WAS THAT I DO JESSE PRIOR A STARTING EVEN ATLAN ACTS AND ADMIRE I FACT TO THINK THE UNNYTHING IS THE VERY FIRST OVIDIO THAT WAS EVER POSTED ON MY CHANNEL WAS O VIDIO THAT HE SHOT AS I DON'T KNOW A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD OR SOMETHING AND I THINK HE YOU JUST FILMED THIS FIRST SECOND I WAS OVER THERE TO YO TO TRAINING A MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY SO A HE THEN OFF WENT OFF THE COLLEGE WHEN IN TO FILM REALIZE HE HAD MUCH A GREENOR PASTURES THAT ATHLE NEXT INSTEAD OF A BECOME THE NEXT TO CRSASIR SOMETHING AND HE DECIDED TO COME A WORK WITH ME AN AND HOU'V THE EXPECTATIONS IN THE BEGINNING WERE JUST TO EDIVIDIOS OR JUST TO A YOU HELP WITH VERIOUS ASPECTS OF OF LIKE MY DAY TO DAY THAT I DON'T THINK I WAS YOO EQUIPPED TABLY HANDLE AND GROW THE BUSINESS ANY MORE SO AM THEND YOU KNOWT LOOK IT BY BY VIRTUE OF BEING IN THAT ENVIRONMENT THERE'S AN INTEREST I THINK IF I WORKED IN THE JIM I MIGHT BECOME INTERESTED IN WORKING OUT AND THOUGH BOT MIN IS NOT A COMMERCIAL JIM ITS SITTING RIGHT BEHIND MY OFFICE HEKOW A WINDOW AM THERE BECAME AN INTEREST IN ONEON TO WORK OUT A LITTLE BIT AND IT WASN'T EVEN AN INTENTIONAL EXPERIMENT YEO TO PUT JESSE THERE I JUST OT THOUGHT THAT HE'S A VERY LIKABLE PERSON HE HAS A VERY FUNNY PERSONALITY HE'S ALSO THE EVERY MAN HE KNOW IN SOME WAYS YOU KNOW AS I'M SURE MAYBE YOU EXPERIENCE SOMETIMES LIKE I'M THE GUY THAT THISIST COMES NATURALLY FOR ME IS WHAT PEOPLE WILL SAY LIKE THIS IS WHAT YOU DO FOR A LIVING THAN THIS IS WHAT YOU LIKE THERE'S AT THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF DISCONNECT IN TERMS OF THE RELATE ABILITY BECAUSE I DO DO THIS FOR A LIVING I CAN'T DENY THAT I DO WORK WITH PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE SELEE THERE'S A LEVEL OF INTEREST IN THIS ABOVE IM BEYOND BUT FOR HIM HES TUST THE KID WHO WANTS TO TRAIN MAYBE IF HE TROLLS OUT OF BED BEFORE ELEVEN I M A AND YOU KNOW DOESN'T HAVE A DATE ON FRIDAY NIGHT BUT THAT'S THE GUIVERYBODY COAN RELATE TO AND WATCHING HIM TRANSFORM AM AND I LOVE THE FACT

TIUSE TO HIM LIKE I SAID WITH MY SON I'LL NOT GET IS FORCE ON HIM BUT ID'T WON'T DO THAT ANYBODY I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S O EVERGAN SPARK THAT DESIRE FOR LONG TERM Y ADOPTION SO HE GOT MORE INTERESTED HES STARTED A LEARN MORE ABOUT IT HE WATCHES OVIDOS THAT WERE FILMING HE FILMS OF VEOS THAT WERE FILMING AND HE'S LEARNING THROUGH WHAT I'M SAYING HE'S BECOMING MORE OF A STUDENT OF THE FIELD AND I I HAVE TO SAY HIS KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD HAS GROWN WITH THE THE GROWTH OF HIS PHYSIQUE AND HE'S PUT IN TE PRACTICE OF THE THINGS THAT I SAY HES PUIN PRACTICE SOMETHINGS HE HEARS OTHER PLACES AND HE WINS OP YOW IMPROVING AS HE GOES AND HE WANTS OF STARTIN TO LOVE THIS LIKE HE YOW NEVER THOUGHT HE WOULD AM BUT IT'S GREAT TO SEE ANYBODY GROW AND WHETHER THAT BE PHYSICALLY OR THE BE EMOTIONALLY O R THER BE YOU KNOW JUST AND IN THEIR CAREER ITS GREAT TO SEE SOMEBODY GRO O AND I I LIKE TO TEASE HIM A FUNNY AADMISSION HERE THERE ARE TIMES WHEND THE JABS THATI WILL THROW AT HIM ARE

WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LADPODCAS T US SCIENCE  SCIENCE PACE TOCE FRLI  I MAY DREHUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDISON TO DAY WE ARE DISCUSSING HOW TO BUILD TENACITY AND WILL POWER PREVIOUS EPISODES OF THE HUBERMAN LABPODCAST HAVE FOCUSED ON THE TOPIC OF MOTIVATION AND WHILE MOTIVATION AND WILL POWER ARE LINKED THEMATICALLY AND MECHANISTICALLY TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS TENACITY THAT IS THE WILLINGNESS TO PERSIST UNDER PRESSURE AND RESISTANCE OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND WILL POWER WHICH HAS TO DO WITH BOTH THE MOTIVATION TO DO THINGS END THE MOTIVATION TO RESIST CERTAIN THINGS TODAY YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT THE PSYCHOLOGY AND NOUR SCIENCE OF TENACITY IN WILL POWER D I MUST TELL YOU THIS IS A FASCINATING LITERATURE IN FACT YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT O BRAIN STRUCTURE THAT AT LEAST TO MY KNOWLEDGE MOST NOURO SCIENTISTS ARE NOT EVEN AWARE OF AND YET IN RESEARCHING THIS EPISODE I ABSOLUTELY FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS BRAIN STRUCTURE BECAUSE OF ITS INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO INDEGRATE THE VERY SORTS OF INFORMATION FROM WITHIN END FROM OUTSIDE OF YOU TO HARNESS AND BUILD TENACITY IN WILL POWER AND INDEED TO DAY YOU WILL LEARN RESEARCH SUPPORTED TOOLS FOR HOW TO INHINTS YOUR LEVEL OF TENACITY IN WILL POWER IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST O CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS MAWE NEWE VENISON MOW WE KNEW EVENISON IS THE MOST NUTRINT DENSE AND DELICIOUS RED MEET AVAILABLE I'VE SPOKEN BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST IN SULLOW EPISODES END WITH GUESS ABOUT THE NEED TO GET APPROXIMATELY ONE GRAM OF HIGH QUALITY PROTEINE PURPOUND OF BODYWAIGHT EACH DAY FOR OPTIMAL NUTRITION THERE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT ONE CAN DO THAT BUT A KEY THING IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT DOING TH T BY INJESTING EXCESSIVE CALLORIES MOWI NEWE VENISON HAS THE HIGHEST DENSITY OF QUALITY PROTINE PER CALLORY AND IT ACHIEVES THAT IN DELICIOUS THINGS LIKE GROUND MEEDS VENISON STAKES JERKY AND BONEBROFF I PARTICULARLY LIKE THE GROUND VENISON I MAKE THOSE INTO VENISON BURGERS PROBABLY FIVE TIMES A WEEK OR MORE I ALSO LIKE THE JERKY FOR ITS CONVENIENCE SPECIALLY WHEN I'M TRAVELLING OR A ESPECIALLY BUSY WITH WORK AND KNOW THAT I'M GETTING AN EXTREMELY NUTRINE DENSE HIGH QUALITY SOURCE OF PROTINE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY MWE NEWE VENISON YOU CAN GO TO MAWE NWY VENISON DOCK CAM SLASH HUBERMAN AND GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF YOUR FIRST ORDER AGAIN THAT'S MAWE NEWY VENISON DOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMAN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY HELICK'S SLEEP HELIC SLEEP MAKES MATTRESSESM PILLOWS THAT ARE TAILORED TO YOUR UNIQUE SLEEP NEEDS NOW SLEEP IS THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE WHEN WE ARE SLEEPING WELL END ENOUGH MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE ALL STAND TO BE AT THEIR BEST ONE OF THE KEYTHINGS TO GETTING A GREAT NIGHT'S SLEEP IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR MATTRESS IS TAILOR TO YOUR UNIQUE SLEEP NEEDS HELIC SLEEP HAS A BRIEF TWO MINUTE QUIZ THAT IF YOU GO TO THEIR WEBSIHE YOU TAKE THAT QUIZ AN ANSWER QUESTIONS SUCH AS DO YOU TEND TO SLEEP ON YOUR BACK YOUR SIDE YOUR STOMACH YOU

YOUR SLEEP NEEDS I SLEEP ON THE DOSKA TO YOU AS KY MATTRES AND WHEN I STARTED SLEEPING ON A DUSK MATTRESS ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO MY SLEEP IMMEDIATELY IMPROVE SO IF YOU'R INTERESTED IN UPGRATING YOUR MATTRES GO TO HELI SLEEP DOCK COM SLASH HUBERMAN TAKE THEIR TWO MINUTE SLEEP QUIZ AND THEY'LL MATCH YOU TO A CUSTOMIZED MATTRESS FOR YOU AND YOU'LL GET UP TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS OFF ANY MATTRESS ORDER AND TWO FREE PILLOWS AGAIN IF INTERESTED GO TO HELICK SEEP DOCK CAM SLASHHUBERMAN FORO TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS OFF AND TOO FREE PILLOWS O K LET'S TALK ABOUT TENACITY AND WILL POWER AND HOW TO ENHANCE YOUR LEVEL OF TENACITY AND WILL POWER I WILL ALSO MENTION CERTAIN CASES WE'RE HAVING TOO MUCH TENACITY AND WILL POWER CAN BE PROBLEMATIC FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HHEALTH BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE I BELIEVE THAT ENHANCING ONE'S LEVEL OF TENACITY IN WILL POWER WOULD BE ADVANTAGIOUS NOW YOU'LL BE RELIEVE TO KNOW THAT WHILE THERE ARER A NEAR INFINITE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE ONE WOULD NEED TO DRAW ON TENACITY IN WILL POWER IN ORDER TO SUCCEED THERE IS ONE MAJOR MECHANISM WITHIN THE BRAIN INDEED ONE MAJOR MECHANISM BY WHICH TENACITY IN WILL POWER ARE GENERATED AND IT ARRIVE THROUGH THE ACTIVATION OF A PARTICULAR BRAIN CENTRE THAT IS A HUB THAT IS IT LIES AT THE INTERFASE OF MANY OTHER NERL CIRCUITS AND HAS INPUT FROM ALL THE CRITICAL NERL CIRCUITS THAT ONE WOULD NEED IN ORDER TO GENERATE TENACITY IN WILL POWER AND WE ARE GOING TO RETURN TO THAT PARTICULAR NERL CIRCUIT A LITTLBIT LATER AFTER WE TALK ABOUT THE PSYCHOLOGY OF WILL POWER BECAUSE IN TALKING ABOUT THE PSYCHOLOGY OF WILL POWER IT WILL FRAME UP AS TO WHY UNDERSTANDING THIS ONE PARTICULAR BRAIN CENTRE OR HUB OF INPUTS IN OUTPUTS FROM DIFFERENT NERL STRUCTURES IN THE BRAIN AND BODY WILL INDEED ALLOW YOU TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THE TOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN IN SCIENTIFIC RECEARCH TO ENHANCE YOUR LEVEL OF TENACITY IN WILL POWER IN OTHER WORDS UNDERSTANDING THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TENACITY IN WILL POWER WHILE VALUABLE IF IT'S COUPLED WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERLYING NERL MECHANISM AND NOTICE I USE THE SINGULAR NERAL MECHANISM NOT MECHANISMS FOR GENERAING TENACITY IN WILL POWER WILL ALLOW YOU TO USE END TO TAILOR THE SPECIFIC PROTOCALS FOR ENHANCING TENACITY N WILL POWER TO YOUR UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES SO THIS IS YET ANOTHER CASE WHERE CERTAINLY LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES VARY FROM ONE PERSON TO THE NEXT THE NEED FOR TENACITY IN WILL POWER VARIES TREMENDOUSLY FOR INSTANCE SOME PEOPLE MAY NEED MORE TENACITY AND WILL POWER IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN BEHAVIORS OTHERS OF US MIGHT NEED MORE TENACITY IN WILL POWER IN ORDER TO RESIST CERTAIN TYPES OF BEHAVIORS TO DAY YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT THE BRAIN CENTR THAT GOVERNS ALL OF THAT AND THEN YOU CAN FRAME IT WITHIN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING OF TENACIT IN WILL POWER SO THAT YOU CAN GET THE MOST OUT OF THE PROTOCALLS THAT WE WILL DISCUSS LET'S START BY TALKING ABOUT WHAT TENACITY AND WILL POWER CLEARLY ARE AND SEPARATING TENACITY IN WILL POWER FROM SOME OTHER PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSTRUCTS THAT THEY OFTEN GET CONFUSED WITH BECAUSE THIS WILL BE IMPORTANT IN UNDERSTANDING EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO BUILD WHEN WE SAY WE WANT TO BUILD TENACITY AND WILL POWER SO TENACITY IN WILL POWER CAN BE DISTINGUISHED FROM HABIT EXECUTION HABIT EXECUTION IS WHAT YOU DO ANY TIME YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING IF YOU LIE THERE FOR A BIT MAY BE GET OUT OF BED IMMEDIATELY HOPFULLY GET OUTSIDE AND GET SOME SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES ESPECIALLY ON CLOUDY DAYS A BRUSH YOUR TEETH USE THE RESTRUM AND GAGE WITH OTHERS IN YOUR HOME IF YOU LIVE WITH OTHERS ET CETERA ALL OF THOSE SORTS OF BEHAVIORS WELL ON SOME DAYS CAN BE A BIT MORE CHALLENGING SPECIALLY THE GET OUT OF BED PART MAY BE DIDN'T GET A GREAT NIGHT SLEEP THE NIGHT BEFORE FOR INSTANCE BUT ALL OF THOSE SORTS OF BEHAVIORS ARE BEHAVIORS THAT YOU HAVE THE NURL STRIRCITS TO GENERATE AND THAT TYPICALLY YOU CAN GENERATE WITHOUT A LOT OF WILL POWER REQUIRED NOW WILL POWER SOMETIMES ALSO REFERRED TO AS TENACITY GRIT OR PERSISTENCE IS A DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT PHENOMENON THAN HABIT EXECUTION BECAUSE WILL POWER AND TENACITY REQUIRE THAT WE INTERVENE IN OUR OWN DEFAULT NURL PROCESSES SUCH AS HABITS OR PARTICULAR PATTERNS OF THINKING AN ESSENTIALLY GOVERN OURSELVES TO DO OR NOT DO SOME PARTICULAR THING AND THAT PROCESS REQUIRES EFFORT IT REQUIRES ENERGY AND I THINK ALL OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH THAT FEELING OF EFFORT OR ENERGY THAT'S REQUIRED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN A BEHAVIOR THAT WE REALLY DON'T FEEL LIKE ENGAGING IN OR AVOIDING A BEHAVIOR OR A THOUGHT THAT BY DEFAULT WE WOULD NATURALLY JUST ENGAGE IN AND WHEN I TALK ABOUT ENERGY IN THIS CONTEXT I MAINLY TALKING ABOUT NURL ENERGY REMEMBER THAT NURON'S NERVE CELLS IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY USE CHEMICAL AND ELECTRICAL SIGNALLING TO COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER THAT'S WHAT ALLOWS YOU AND ALL OF US TO DO ALL THE THINGS THAT WE DO THINK FEEL MOVE ET CETERA NO OF COURSE THAT CHEMICAL AND ELECTRICAL COMMUNICATION REQUIRES FUEL SOURCES THAT INDEED COME FROM THINGS LIKE GLUCOS KEYTONES THE CREATINE PHOSPHATE SYSTEMULTIPL FUEL SYSTEMS FEED THE ENERGETICS OF THE BRAIN BUT ULTIMATELY WHEN I TALK ABOUT ENERGY IN TODAY'S DISCUSSION I'M TALKING ABOUT THE ENERGY REQUIRE TO ENGAGE IN OR TO RESIST IN A PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR AND THAT LEVEL OF ENERGY CAN BE QUITE HIGH DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH RESISTANCE WE ARE FEELING INTERNALLY OR EXTERNALLY RIGHT SOMEBODY CAN BE TELLING US YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS YOU CAN'T DO IT IN YOU CAN SAY NOW I HAVE A TON OF RESOLVE I HAVE A TON OF TENACITY WILL POWER AND I'M GETTO PUSHPAST ALL THE BARRIERS THAT YOU ARE SETTING UP FOR ME ON THE OUTSIDE OFTEN TIMES ALL TOO OFTEN I SHOULD SAY WE EXPERIENCE RESISTANCE FROM THE INSIDE WHERE WE ARE FEELING LIKE WE DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING OR WE REALLY WANT TO DO SOMETHING AND WE ARE HAVING TROUBLE EITHER ENGAGING IN THE THING THAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO OR THAT WE KNOW WE SHOULD DO BUT WE JUST DON'T FEEL THAT LEVEL OF MOTIVATION FOR OR WE ARE HAVING A HARD TIME RESISTING THE THING THAT'S PULLING US TOWARD IT SO IN THAT CONTEXT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US NOT TO DISTINGUISH TENACITY IN WILL POWER FROM HABIT EXECUTION BUT ALSO DRAW OUT A CONTINUUM WITH TENACITY IND WILL POWER THEY'RE MOST EXTREME ON ONE END OF THAT CONTINUUM AND APATHY END YES DEPRESSION ON THE OTHER END OF THAT CONTINUUM AND WE WILL RETURN TO THE TOPIC OF DEPRESSION ALOBIT LATER BUT I CAN JUST CEW IT UPRIGHT NOW BY SAYING THAT ONE OF THE HALLMARKED FEATURES OF MAJOR DEPRESSION IS A LACK OF POSITIVE ANTICIPATION ABOUT THE FUTURE THAT LEADS TO THIS IS IMPORTANT THERE'S A VERB TENSE HERE THAT LEADS TO A MUCH LOWER TENDENCY TO ENGAGE IN THE SPECIFIC TYPES OF BEHAVIOR THAT WOULD ALLOW ONE TO ARRIVE AT A PARTICULAR NEW DIFFERENT AND POSITIVE FUTURE SO I'M DELIBERATELY PUTTING APATHY AND DEPRESSION NEXT TO ONE ANOTHER AT ONE END OF THE CONTINUUM AND I'M PUTTING GRET PERSISTENCE TENACITY AND WILL POWER AT THE OTHER END OF THE CONTINUUM AND A LOBIT LATER IT WILL BECOME VERY CLEA R TO YOU WHY I PUT THOSE PARTICULAR ITEMS ON THE CONTINUUM AS OPPOSED TO OTHER PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSTRUCTS SUCH AS MOTIVATION BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT MOTIVATION IS WHAT ALLOWS YOU TO MOVE UP AND DOWN THAT CONTINUUM BUT MOTIVATION ITSELF AS A VERB IS DISTINCT FROM WHAT WE CALL TENACITY AND WILL POWER AND MOTIVATION ITSELF IS DISTINCT FROM WHAT WE CALL APATHY AND DEPRESSION BUT MOTIVATION IS THE ENGINE OR THE MOTOR THE VERB THAT ALLOWS YOU TO MOVE UP AND DOWN THAT CONTINUUM AND TODAY YOU WILL LEARN MULTIBAL TOOLS THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO MOVE TOWARD THE TENACITY IN WILL POWER AND OF THAT CONTINUUM BY ENGAGING A VERY SPECIFIC NERAL CIRCUIT BEFORE WE GET INTO THE DISCUSSION OF NARAL CIRCUITS I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE PSYCHOLOGY OF WILL POWER AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY HAS BEEN CONSIDERED BY PSYCHOLOGIST FOR WELL OVER A HUNDRED YEARS WILLIAM JAMES WROTE ABOUT THIS THE ANCIENT GREEKS WROTE ABOUT THIS THE TOPIC OF WILL POWER IS CERTAINLY NOT A NEW ONE AND YET THE FORMAL STUDY OF WILL POWER IN THE LABORATORY CONTEXT THAT IS BRINGING HUMAN SUBJECTS INTO THE LABORATORY AND EXAMINING WHAT SORTS OF CONDITIONS ALLOW THEM TO ENGAGE THEIRE WILL POWER AND TENACITY WHAT SORTS OF CONDITIONS REALLY SAP OR DRAIN THERE WILL POWER AND TENACITY AND OF COURSE PARALLEL EXPERIMENTS DONE IN WHAT WE CALL PRECLINICAL MODELS WHICH ARE ANIMAL STUDIES HAVE REVEALED TO US A LOT ABOUT THE SORTS OF CONDITIONS THAT ALLOW US TO GENERATE WILL POWER AND THE SORTS OF CONDITIONS THAT DRAIN OUR WILL POWER NOW IF WE ARE TO THROW OURARMS AROUND THAT ENTIRE LITERATURE THERE IS A BIG BATCH OF THAT LITERATURE NOT THE WHOLE BATCH BUT THERE'S A BIG BATCH OF THAT LITERATURE THAT BELIEVED AND STILL BELIEVES THAT WILL POWER IS A LIMITED RESOURCE MUCH LIKE FUEL IN THE BODY OR FUEL IN A CAR NOW THE IDEA OF WILL POWER AS A LIMITED RESOURCE IS CERTAINLY NOT A NEW IDEA BUT AGAIN THE FORMAL STUDY OF WILL POWER AND WILL POWER AS A LIMITED RESOURCE REALLY DATES BACK LITTLE OVER TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS WHEN ROY BILM ISTER AND COLLEAGUES STARTED TO EXPLORE THE IDEA THAT OF COURSE HAD BEN KICKED AROUND FOR YEARS THAT WITH EACH ADDITIONAL DECISION THAT WE HAVE TO ENGAGE ACROSS THE DAY AND WITH EACH ADDITIONAL BOUT OF WILL POWER THAT WE HAVE TO DRAW ON AS A RESOURCE THAT WE WOULD DRAIN THIS RESERVOIR OF WILL POWER THAT WE ALL HAVE WITHIN US NOW BALMISTER AND COLLEGUES REFERRED TO THAT PROCESS AS EGO DEPLETION NOW WHEN PEOPLE HEAR THE WORD EGO SOME PEOPLE THINK FROYD EGO SUPER EGO ID AND SO FORTH MOST PEOPLE THINK EGO LIKE SOMEBODY HAVING A BIG PERSONALITY WHERE THEY THINK A LOT OF THEMSELVES WHEN BALMISTER REFER TO EGO DE PLETION HE WAS DEFINING EGO DE PLETION AS A CONCEPT OF ONESELF AND A CONCEPT OF OUTSIDE CHALLENGES AND THE DEGREE OF EFFORT REQUIRE TO BRIDGE ONE'S CONCEPT OF SELF AND THOSE CHALLENGES AND SO EGO DEPLTION IS REALLY A OPERATIONAL CONSTRUCT WITHIN THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY SO WE DON'T WANT TO GET TOO DISTRACTED BY THAT WORD EGO THERE'S A TENDENCY ANY TIME PEOPLE HERE EGO FOR THEY HEAR NARCICISM OR THEY HEAR GAS LIGHTING TO IMMEDIATELY ASSUME THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS WHEN IN FACT THE FORMAL DEFINITIONS OF THOSE QUITE OFTEN DIFFER FROM THE WAY THAT THERE KICTURE ROUND ON SOCIAL MEDIA THE INTERNATE AN EVEN IN A LOT OF POPULAR WRITING ABOUT PSYCHOLLEGY O CASSOLITS JUST NOTE THAT EGO DEPLETION IS THE TERM THAT BALMISTER USED TO DESCRIBE THE ABILITY FOR OUR WILL POWER TO BE DEPLEDED WITH EACH SUCCESSIVE ATTEMPT TO ENGAGE WILL POWER AND BY EXTENSION OUR ABILITY TO REPLENISH OUR DEGREE OF WILL POWER IF WE TAKE A BREAK FROM MAKING DECISIONS IN ENGAGING OUR WILL POWER BUT EGO DEPLETION ITSELF ISN'T THE FOCUS RIGHT NOW THE FOCUS RIGHT NOW IS WEATHER NOT INDEED WILL POWER IS A LIMITED RESOURCE AND WEATHER NOT WITH EACH DECISION THAT WE MAKE AND EACH EFFORT TO EITHER ENGAGE IN AN ACTIVITY THAT WE PREFER NOT TO AT LEAST IN THAT MOMENT AND WITH EACH ATTEMPT TO RESIST A BEHAVIOR THOUGHT ITSCETERA THAT IS PULLING ON US OR THAT WE FEE L THAT WE WANT TO ENGAGE IN BY DEFAULT EITHER EATING THE COOKIE OR THINKING THE THOUGHT OR ENGAGING IN A PARTICULAR TYPE OF BEHAVIOR OF ANY KIND AND WE NEED TO RESIST THAT THAT IT IS DRAINING THAT WILL POWER RESOURCE AN BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER I KNOW THAT SOME OF YOU OUT THERE ARE PROBABLY AWARE THAT EGO DEPLETION AND THE BALMEISTER THEORY OF WILL POWER AS A LIMITED RESOURCE HAS BEEN VERY CONTENTIOUS ESPECIALLY IN RECENT YEARS AND SO TODAY WHAT I'M GOING TO DO AS I'M GOING TO FIRST PRESENT THE BLMSTER AND COLLEAGUE'S WORK ABOUT WILL POWER AS A LIMITED RESOURCE AND THEN I'M GOING TO PRESENT SOME OF THE CONFLICTING EVIDENCE THAT CARROL DUECK MY COLLEGUE AT STAMFORD CHOOL MEDICINE AND RESEARCHERS ELSEWHERE HAVE CARRIED OUT MED AND ELS'S END ENTIRELY NEW EXPERIMENTS WHICH INDEED IN SOME CASES CONTRADICT THE FINDINGS OF BALMISTER BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT CONTRADICT THE CONCLUSIONS THAT BALMISTER DREW ABOUT WILL POWER SIF WE ARE TO UNDERSTAND THE PSYCHOLOGY OF WILL POWER AND TENACITY IT'S IMPORTANT THT WE UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPTS OF EGO DEPLETION AND WILL POWER AS A LIMITED RESOURCE EVEN IF AFTER HEARING ALL THE EVIDENCE YOU DECIDE THAT WILL POWER IS NOT A LIMITED RESOURCE AND IN FACT I'M QUITE CONFIDENT THAT ONCE YOU HEAR ABOUT THE BALMISTER WORK AND THAN YOU HEAR ABOUT THE WORK OF DUECK AND OTHERCE WHICH IN SOME WAYS COUNTERS THE CONCLUSIONS OF BLMSTER THAT YOU'LL HAVE A MUCH FIRMER AN CERTAINLY MUCH MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT TENACITY IN WILL POWER ARE AND PERHAPS AND HERE I'M REVEALING MY OWN LEANINGS WHEN HAVING EXAMINED THE TOTALITY OF THE DATA THAT TENACITY IND WILL POWER IN SOME CASES IS A LIMITED RESOURCE THAT CAN BE REPLENISHED BY ENGAGING PARTICULAR PROCESSES WITHIN THE BODY THAT'S RIGHT WITHIN THE BODY BUT THAT WILL POWER AND TENACITY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY HOW TO ENGAGE TENACITY IN WILL POWER ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF CHALLENGES IN FRONT OF YOU NOT JUST ONE CHALLENGE BUT MULTIPLE CHALLENGES THAT NEE TO BE CARRIED OUT THROUGHOUT THE DAY OVER WEEKS OVER MONTHS ET CETERA THAT TENACITY AN WILL POWER CAN BE DRAWN UPON REPEATEDLY WITHOUT THEM BEING TO PLEAD IT IF YOU ARE CLEAR ON YOUR BELIEFS ABOUT TENACITY IN WILL POWER SO I REALIZE THAT WHAT I JUST BROUGHT UP WAS A CONTROVERSY ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I HAVEN'T EVEN DISCUSSED YET SO IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE A BIT OF A SWIRL OF INFORMATION FOR WHICH THERE'S REALLY NO CONTEXT BUT THE REASON I BRING UP THE CONTROVERSY AT THIS STAGE OF OUR CONVERSATION IS THAT THE MOMENT THAT THE WORDS EGO DEPLETION OR WILL POWER IS A LIMITED RESOURCE FALLS OUT OF MY MOUTH I CAN HEAR THOSE VOICES OUT THERE SAYING WAIT A SECOND I THOUGHT THAT WAS ALL DEBUNKED AND I WANT TO MAKE VERY CLEAR WILL POWERS A LIMITED RESOURCE AND EGO DEPLETION HAVE NOT BEEN DEBUNKED IT'S SIMPLY A CONTROVERSAL AREA OF PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR TODAY'S DISCUSSION WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE THEORY OF WILL POWER IS A LIMITED RESOURCE IF WE ARE TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTROVERSY THAT IS THE COUNTER ARGUMENT OF WHAT WILL POWER REALLY IS THAT COMES FROM OTHER GROUPS SO I REALLY WANT TO GIVE YOU BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY SO THAT WHEN WE GET TO THE UNDERLYING NURAL MECHANISMS FOR TENACITY IND WILL POWER AND WE GET TO THE TOOLS AND PROTOCALS FOR INCREASING YOUR LEVEL OF TENACITY AND WILL POWER AND YOU'R FLEXIBILITY A WILL POWER IN DIFFERENT CONTEXT THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THOSE TOOLS AND PROTOCALS O CESO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE THAT WILL POWER IS A LIMITED RESOURCE THINK MOST OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH WHAT WILL POWER FEELS LIKE THAT IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE TENACIOUS AND AGAIN THEIRE TWO SIDES TO THIS COIN THERE'S WILL POWER AND TENACITY OF THE SOURT OF TRYING TO ENGAGE IN A BEHAVIOR WHEN WE REALLY DON'T WANT TO OR WHEN OUR IMPULSE IS NOT TO ENGAGE IN THAT BEHAVIOR AND I SAY WHEN OUR IMPULSE IS NOT TO ENGAGE IN THAT BEHAVIOR BECAUSE OFTENTIMES WE WANT TO ENGAGE IN THE BEHAVIOR WE WANT TO STUDY WE WANT TO LEARN THE INSTRUMENT WE WANT TO PERFORM WHELL WE WANT TO EXERCISE WE WANT THE BENEFITS OF ALL THOSE THINGS SI'S NOT THAT WE DON'T WANT THE OUTCOMES ORE THE REWARDS OF THOSE THINGS AND IN MANY CASES IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T ENJOY THOSE ACTIVITIES BUT THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON WE ARE FEELING A LACK OF MOTIVATION WE'RE DRIFTING DOWN THAT CONTINUUM TOWARD THE MORE APATHETIC AND OF THINGS HOFULLY NOT ALL THE WAY TO DEEP DEPRESSION AND APATHY BUT WE'RE DRIFTING THAT WAY OR WE'RE NOT FAR ENOUGH OF THE CONTINUUM AND WE'RE NOT ENGAGING ENOUGH MOTIVATION TO FEEL LIKE THE DESIRE TO DO SOMETHING EITHER FOR ITS OWN SAKE OR FOR THE REWARDS AND OUTCOMES OF THAT THING ARE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW US TO JUST DO THAT THING HENCE THE NIKY SLOGAN JUST DO IT WHICH IS A WONDERFUL SLOGAN EXCEPT THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE MECHANISMS OF HOW WE CAN GET OURSELVES TO JUST DO SOMETHING OFTENTIMES IT FALLS SHORT AND TO BE HONEST ANY TIME I HEAR ABOUT PEOPLE SAYIG WE'LL JUST ELIMINATE THE THINKING AND JUST DO IT THAT IS VALUABLE ADVICE UNTIL IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE WHEN IT DOESN'T WORK IT SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK AND THEN YOU NEED TO RELY ON OTHER TOOLS AN MECHANISMS WHICH ARE THE SORT THT WEWILL TALK ABOUT TO DAY SO WHELL I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE JUST DO IT MONTRA WHEN IT DOESN'T WORK IT DOESN'T OFFER ANY ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS TO ENGAGE TENACITY AND WILL POWERAN I DO NOT KNOW ANY ONE ON THIS PLANET I DON'T CARE F YOUR DAVID GOGANS OR CORTNEY DO WALTER THERE WILL BE DAYS WHEN TELLING YOURSELF JUST DO THIS OR JUST DON'T DO THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT FOR YOU TO ENGAGE IN THE BEHAVIORS OR RESIST THE BEHAVIORS OR THOUGHTS THAT YOU NEED TO ENGAGE IN OR RESIST THAT'S JUST REALITY AND WE SHOULD ASK OURSELVES WHY IS THAT REALITY AND THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT AND IN FACT REALLY ILLUSTRATES THE FIRST BUCKET OF TOOLS AND PROTOCALS FOR INCREASING TENACITY IN WILL POWER AND THESE ARE THE TOOLS AND PROTOCALS THAT I WOULD CATEGORIZE UNDER THE RUBRIC OF MODULATORS I'VE TALKED BEFORE IN THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE IMPORTANT DISTINCTION BETWEEN MEDIATORS AND MOGULATORS MEDIATORS OR THINGS EITHER PSYCHOLOGICAL OR BIOLOGICAL ET CETERA THAT ARE DIRECTLY IN THE MECHANISMS THAT GENERATE SOME SORT OF ACTION OR EMOTION IS CAN BE NUR CHEMICALS LIKE DOPOMINE OR SERTONAN AND SO ON MODULATORS OR THINGS THAT CAN MODULATE THAT IS CAN CHANGE OUR PROBABILITY OF DOING SOMETHING OR NOT DOING SOMETHING BUT THEY DO SO INDIRECTLY AND IN THE CONTEXT OF TOOLS AND PROTOCALS TO INCRE ASE ARE LEVEL OF TENACITY AND WILL POWER I WOILL BE COMPLETELY REMISS IF ONE OF THE SETS OF TOOLS THAT IS THE PROTOCALS FOR INCREASING THE PROBABILITY THAT WE CAN ACCESS HIGH LEVELS OF TENACITY AND WILL POWER DIDN'T INCLUDE AT LEAST SOME OF THESE MODULATORS SO'M JUST GOING TO SPEND ABOUT THREE MINUTES ON THESE MODULATORS BECAUSE WHAT WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN IS THAT THE REGIONS OF THE BRAIN THAT GENERATE TENACITY AND AGAIND THERE IS LITERALLY A BRAIN HUB FOR GENERATING WILL POWER AND TENACITY GETS STRONG IMPUT FROM THE SO CALLED AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM HAS TOO MAJOR COMPONENTS THEY ARE REFERRED TO AS THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THE PARA SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM KEEP IN MIND BECAUSE WHEN MOST PEOPLE HEAR THE WORD SYMPATHETIC THEY THINK SYMPATHY THEY THINK COMMOTION IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT SYMPA MEANS TOGETHER AND THE SYMPATHETIC ARM OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM I KNOW THAT'S A MOUTHFUL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR GENERATING STATES OF ALERTNESS IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY EVERYTHING FROM PANIC TO BEING ALERT AND CALM OUR TENDENCY TO MOVE OR AR LIKELIHOOD OF MOVING UNDER PRESTIURE IT IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ABILITY TO RESIST MOVEMENT WHEND WE NEED TO RESIST MOVEMENT AND THEREFORE IT'S AN ACTIVE PROCESS SO THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS ALL THE THINGS OF ACTION AND WHEN IT IS INVOLVED IN GENERATING INACTION THOSE ARE CASES WHERE INACTION REQUIRES ENERGY HEH I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR BY THES THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ISN'T JUST ABOUT MOVING OUR BODY ALTHOUGH IT HAS A LOT TO DO ITH THAT IT IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ABILITY TO RESIST MOVEMENT OR THOUGHT OR EMOTION WHEN WE NEED TO DO THAT CLAMP DOWN ON OURSELVES THE PARISYMPATHETIC ASPECT OF OUR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS THE ONE THAT SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS THE REST AND DIGEST NORAL CIRCUITS AND CHEMICALS AND THAT'S TRUE BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE TOO THE PARI SYMPATHETIC COMPONENT OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM S ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR FALLING ASLEEP IT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR US FEELING RELAXED IT IS RESPONSIBLE L FOR MOST OF THE STATES OF MIND AND BODY IN WHICH WE ARE QUIESCENT WHERE WE DON'T FEEL AN IMPULSE TO MOVE WHERE WHEN WE HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME GETTING INTO ACTION SO THE SYMPATHETIC AND THE PARI SYMPATHETIC ASPECT OF THE AUTONOMIC ERVEUS SYSTEM ARE ALWAYS IN A PUSH PULL WITH ONE ANOTHER THINK OF THEM OR LESS ON A TEETER TOTTER WHEN ONE END GOES UP THE OTHER END GOES DOWN THERE REALLY INCOMPETITION WITH ONE ANOTHER AND IT'S THERE BALANCE THAT REFLECTS HOW ALERT OR HOW SLEEPY WE HAPPEN TO BE NOW THE REASON I'M GIVING YOU THIS RATHER GEEKY NERED SPEAK NOMINCLATURE FILLED DISCUSSION ABOUT THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IN THE CONTECT OF WILL POWER IS THAT REGARDLESS OF WEATHERNOT YOU BELIEVE WILL POWER IS A LIMITED OR AN UNLIMITED RESOURCE WE KNOW ONE THING FOR SORE AND THAT'S THAT WILL POWER AND TENACITY RIDE ON OUR CURRENT AUTONOMIC FUNCTION WE CAN TRANSLATE THAT TO EVERYDAY LANGUAGE BY SAYING THAT WHEN WE ARE WELL RESTED FOR INSTANCE WHEN WE'VE BEEN GETTING GREAT SLEEP OF SUFFICIENT DURATION THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AND THE NIGHT BEFORE THAT OUR LEVEL OF TENACITY IN WILL POWER TO ENGAGE IN THINGS THAT WE WOULD NOT ORDINARILY ENGAGE IN BY DEFAULT AND OUR ABILITY TO RESIST BEHAVIORS AND THOUGHT PATTERNS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE OUR DEFAULT BEHAVIORS AND THOUGHT PATTERNS IS MUCH HIGHER CONVERSELY WHEN WE ARE NOT GETTING ENOUGH QUALITY SLEEP ON A REGULAR BASIS OUR ABILITY TO CALL ON TENCITY IN WILL POWER IS DIMINISHED NOW THAT SERIES OF STATEMENTS I JUST MADE IS CLEARLY GOING TO BE A DUE FOR MOST PEOPLE BUT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN WE ARE SLEEP DEPRIVED WHEN WE ARE IN PHYSICAL PAIN WHEN WE ARE IN EMOTIONAL PAIN AND OR WHEN WE ARE DISTRACTED WHEN WE ARE THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE ASIDE FROM WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ENGAGE TENACITY IN WILL POWER IN ORDER TO DO OR NOT DO TENACITY AND WILL POWER WILL BE DIMINISHED NOW ALL OF THOSE THINGS TOGETHER ARE JUST A BIGGER DU AWE ALL KNOW THIS IF YOU GOT A SPLINTER IN YOUR FOOT IT'S REALLY HARD TO THINK ABOUT NOT THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE IF YOU ARE EXTREMELY HUNGRY OR IF YOU HAD AN ARGUMENT WITH SOMEBODY THT YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT N THEY SAID SOMETHING TAT WAS PARTICULARLY VEXING TO YOU AND IT'S LOOPING AROUND IN YOUR HEAD T'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO ENGAGE IN SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU NEED TO DO BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO BE DISTRACTED LIKEWISE IF YOU'R SLEEP DEPRIVED LIKEWISE IF YOU ARE A BIT SICK OR RUN DOWN REF YOUARE ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL OR EMOTIONAL PAIN YOUR ABILITY TO DRAW ON TENACITY IN WILL POWER WILL BE DIMINISHED SO IT'S AN ABSOLUTE TRUTH THAT YOUR ABILITY TO GENERATE TENACITY IN WILL POWER RIDES ON A RESERVOAR OF AUTONOMIC FUNCTION AND TO DAY WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A WAY OF QUANTIFYING THE LEVEL OF AUTONOMIC FUNCTION OR DISFUNCTION IN A VERY SIMPLE WAY 'S NOT LIKE RESTING HEART RATE ALTHOUGH RESTING HEARTRATE IS INVOLVED FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAVEN'T SLEPT WELL FOR A FEW NIGHTS OR IF YOU ARE PARTICULARLY STRESSED OVER TRAINED YOU'LL WAKE UP IN THE MORNING WITH A SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED HEARTRIGHT HOWEVER THERE IS NO SIMPLE METRIC LIKE HEART RATE OR BLOOD PRESSURE OR EVEN CORTUS ALL LEVEL THAT CAN TELL YOU WHETHER OR NOT YOUR AUTONOMIC FUNCTION IS INBALANCE THAT IS THE SYMPATHETIC IN PARIS SYMPATHETIC SYSTEMS OF YOUR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ARE IN THE BEST POSSIBLE BALANCE TO GENERATE TENACITY IN WILL POWER WE DON'T YET HAVE SUCH A METRIC ALTHOUGH THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT ARE STRYING TO DEVELOP DEVICES THAT HOPEFULLY WILL GIVE US INDICEASE OF AUTONOMIC FUNCTION OR DISFUNCTION BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU'RE NOT TAKING CARE OF THE FOUNDATIONAL MODULATORS OF TENACITY IN WILL POWER NONE OF THE SUBSEQUENT TOOLS AND PROTOCOLS THAT WE WILL DISCUSS ARE GOING TO HELP YOU THAT MUCH OVER TIME YOU MIGHT GET TENACITY IN WILL POWER TO ENGAGE ONE DAY WHEN YOUARE VERY SLEEP DEPRIVED BUT IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO CONSISTENTLY ENGAGE TENACITY IN WILL POWER FOR THAT REASON IF YOU HAVE ANY STRUGGLES WITH SLEEP THAT IS GETTING ENOUGH QUALITIES SLEEP ON A REGULAR BASIS PLEASE SEE THE ZERO COST TOOL KIP FOR SLEEP THAT WE PUT AT HUBERMAN LABDOC CALM PLEASE ALSO SEE THE PERFECT YOUR SLEEP MASTER YOUR SLEEP EPISODS ALSO AT HUBERMAN LABDOCK CAM IT PLEASE ALSO SEE THE EPISODE WITH EXPERT GUESS DOCTOR MATHEW WALKER PROFESSOR OF SLEEP NERROW SCIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGY AND UNIVERSY CALIFORNIA BERKLY WE JUST REVAMP THE HUBERMAN LAB WEBSITE SO IF YOU GO TO HUVEROM LABDOCK COMAND YOU PUT SOMETHING LIKE SLEEP INTO THE SEARCH FUNCTION IT WILL TAKE YOU NOTCOUS TO THE TOOL KIP FOR SLEEP BUT TO THE EXACT TIME STAMPS THAT WILL CUE UP PARTICULAR TOPICS AND PROTOCALS AROUND SLEEP SO IF YOU WERE TO PUT SLEEP AND LIGHT IT WOULD TAKE YOU TO THOSE PARTICULAR PROTOCOLS OF YOU WERE TO PUT SLEEP AND MAGNESIUM THREENATE IT WOULD TAKE YOU TO THOSE PARTICULAR PROTOCOLS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH AY I DONT WANT TO GET TOO FAR OFF TOPIC HERE DURING TO DAY'S DISCUSSION BUT IF YOU'RE NOT SLEEPING WELL AND IF YOU'RE NOT MANAGING YOUR STRESS LEVELS WELL IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH HARDER FOR YOU TO ENGAGE TENACITY AN WILL POWER REGARDLESS OF THE TOOLS HAPANY USE AND THOSE TOOLS COULD BE EVERYTHING FROR BEHAVIOURAL TOOLS TO SUPPLEMENTS TO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS YOU NEED TO GET THOSE FOUNDATIONAL MODULATORS IN CHECK AND THERER LOT OF ZERO COSSWAYS TO DO THAT THAT ARE ALL SPELLED OUT VERY CLEARLY AT THE RESOURCES I JUST DESCRIBE LIKEWISE FOR STRESS IF YOUR EXPERIENCING CHALLENGES WITH STRESS BOTH SHORT TERM MEDIUM TERM OR LONG TERM STRESS IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE ELEVATED CORTESALL LEVELS WHICH BY THE WAY MAY NOT BE THE CASE THERERE A LOT OF TOOLS FROM MODULAYING STRESS IN REAL TIME INCREASING YOUR STRESTTHRESHOLD AT SADERA SIMPLY GO TO THE HUBRN LABDOT COMWEB SITE AND PUT IN STRESS THRESHOLD TOOLS OR STRESS REAL TIME TOOLS AND YOU'LL GET A BUNCH OF ZERO COST TOOLS THAT WILL ALOW YOU TO DO THAT IT'S ALSO WORTH MENTIONING THAT WHEN WE GET TO OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT THE NERRO SCIENCE OF TENACITY AND WILL POWER THAT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHY AUTONOMIC HEALTH AN AUTONOMIC FUNCTION IS SO IMPORTANT FOR OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE TENACITY AND WILL POWER I'LL JUST TELL YOU RIGHT NOW IT'S BECAUSE THE NERL CIRCUITS OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM PROVIDE DIRECT AND ROBUST IN PUT TO THIS HUB IN THE BRAIN THIS BRAINLOCATION THAT GOVERNS OUR ABILITY TO ALICATE OUR MIND AND BODY TOWARD PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES OR TO RES ST PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TAKING A G ONE DAILY SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSERING THE PODCAST A G ONE IS A VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT'S DESIGNED TO ME ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITION NEEDS OF COURSE I TRY TO GET ENOUGH SERVINGS OF VITEMENS AND MINERALS THROUGH WHOLE FOOD SOURCES THAT INCLUDE VEGETABLES AND FRUITS EVERY DAY BUT OFTENTIMES I SIMPLY CAN'T GET ENOUGH SERVINGS BUT WITH A G ONE I'M SURE TO GET ENOUGH VITEMENTS AND MINERALS AND THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED AND IT ALSO CONTAINS ADAPTAGENS TO HELP BUFFER STRESS SIMPLY PUT I ALWAYS FEEL BETTER WHEN I TAKE A G ONE I HAVE MORE FOCUS AND ENERGY AND I SLEEP BETTER AND IT ALSO HAPPENS TO TASTE GRIGHT FOR ALL THESE REASONS WHENEVER I'M ASKED IF YOU COULD TAKE JUST ONE SUPPLEMENT WHAT WOULD IT BE I ANSWER A G ONE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY A G ONE THEY'LL TO DRINK A G ONE DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUSS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TWO AGAIN THAT'S DRINK A G ONE DOT COM SLASH HUBERMEN O CASE SO LET'S THINK ABOUT THE BALMISTER DATA ON WILL POWER AS A LIMITED RESOURCE I'M GOING TO BRIEFLY DESCRIBE ONE OF THE FIRST STUDIES THAT REALLY SAID TO THE FIELD WILL POWER IS A LIMITED RESOURCE BUT I WANT TO BE CLEARE THAT THERE'RE OTHER STUDIES LIKE IT AND THEY ALL GENERALLY FOLLOW THE SAME CONTOUR AND THAT GENERAL CONTOUR IS AS FOLLOWS BOUT MY STERING COLLEAGUES AND NOW MANY OTHER LABORATORIES HAVE DONE EXPERIMENTS WHERE THEY BRING HUMAN SUBJECTS INTO THE LABORATORY AND THOSE HUMAN SUBJECTS HAVE TO DO SOMETHING THAT REQUIRES MENTAL EFFORT OR ENERGY AH A WILL POWER THE CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF THIS IS YOU BRING PEOPLE INTO THE LABORATORY SOME OF THEM MIGHT ACTUALLY BE DIETING OR FASTED ALTHOUGH NOT ALWAYS AND THERE ARE TWO PLATTERS SET OUT FOR THEM ONE PLATTER CONTAINS RADISHES JUST PLAIN RADSHES BY THE WAY I HATE RADISHES UNLESS THEIR PICKLED RADISHES N WHY THAT IS SO THESE EXPERIMENTS PICKED MY LEAST FAVORITE VEGETABLE I LOVE MANY OTHER VEGETABLES A DISDAIN THE RATIS H THOS JUST A PERSONAL EDITORIAL IN ANY CASE THE RADISHES ARE SET OUT AND NEXT OF THEM ARE FRESHLY BAKED COOKIES AND IN THE ROOM IS THE WAFTING AROMAS OF FRESHLY BAKED COOKIES SO I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT MOST PEOPLE BECAUSE OF A HARD WIRED TENDENCY TO LIKE SUGAR AND FAT ESPECIALY WHEN THEY ARE COMBINED WOULD PREFER TO EAT THE COOKIES VERSES THE RADISHES I KNOW THAT THERE'RE SOME MUTINCS OUT THERE THERE SAYING I LIKE RADISHES MORE THAN COOKIES BUT LOOK MOST PEOPLE LIKE COOKIES MORE THAN RADISHES THE SUBJECTS IN THESE STUDIES ARE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS ONE GROUP IS TOLD YOU HAVE TO RESIST EATING THE RADISHES THE OTHER GROUP IS TOLD YOU HAVE TO RESIST EATING THE COOKIES AND THEN THE SUBJECTS ARE OBSERVED DURING THIS TIME TYPICALLY BUT THIS IS REALLY NOT WHAT THE EXPERIMENT IS ABOUT PER SAY THIS STAGE OF THE EXPERIMENT IS REALLY DESIGNED TO GET PEOPLE TO RESIST A CERTAIN KIND OF BEHAVIOR AND THE ASSUMPTION AGAIN THIS IS AN ASSUMPTION CAUSE THERE'S NO BRAIN RECORDINGS HERE KNOWNS AN AN EMORI MACHINE LOOKING AT WHAT BRAIN AREAS ARE ACTIVEATED ARE NOT ACTIVELY THERE'S NO CORDERS ALL BEING MEASURED AT LEAST NOT IN THESE EARLY EXPERIMENTS THESE PEOPLE ARE EITHER RESISTING SOMETHING THAT'S PRETTY EASY TO RESIST RADISHES OR THEYARE BEING ASKED TO RESIST SOMETHING THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE IS GOING TO BE HARDER TO RESIST THAN RESISTING RADISHES WHICH IS RESISTING FRESHLY BAKED COOKIES AND THAT CHALLENGE HAS BEEN MADE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT BY THE WAFTING AROMAS OF FRESHLY BATE COOKIES IN THE ROOM AND IN SOME CASES HAS BEEN MADE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE DIETING AND KEEP IN MIND THAT WHEN YOU CALORY RESTRICT OR WHEN YOU PUT YOURSELF ON A DIET OF ANY KIND THERE IS A WELL ESTABLISHED MECHANISM IN THE BRAIN BY WHICH THE NURONS THAT ENGAGE HUNGER ESPECIALLY HUNGER FOR FAT AND SUGAR AND THAT RESPOND TO THINGS LIKE AROMAS AND TASTE ARE HEIGHTENED THAT IS THER ACTIVITY LEVELS ARE HEIGHTENED WHICH MEANS THAT THINGS THAT SMELL REALLY GOOD SMELL REALLY REALLY GOOD WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY THINGS THAT ORDINARILY WOULD TASTE REALLY GOOD TASTE REALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD WHEN YOU FINALLY EAT THEM SO THE KEE COMPONENT OF THIS STAGE OF THE EXPERIMENT IS TO ENGAGE PEOPLE'S WILL POWER THE SECOND PART OF THE EXPERIMENT HAS ALL OF THE SUBJECTS SEPARATELY ENGAGE IN ANOTHER CHALLENGING TASK AND THE CHALLENGING TASK THAT THEY ASK TO ENGAGE IN IS TO SOLVE A PARTICULAR PUZZLE AND AGAIN DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS USED DIFFERENT PUZZLES DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS USED DIFFERENT CONTECTS BUT THE ORIGINAL EXPERIMENTS THAT BALLMISTER AND CHOLEGUES DID HAD PEOPLE TRY AND SOLVE A PUZZLE THAT COULD NOT BE SOLVED SO IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT IN FACT ITS IMPOSSIBLE BUT THE SUBJECTS WEREN'T AWARE OF THAT AND THEN WAS MEASURED WAS HOW LONG SUBJECTS PERSISTED IN TRYING TO SOLVE THIS IMPOSSIBLE TO SOLVE PUZZLE DEPENDING ON WHEATHER R NOT PREVIOUSLY THEY HAD TO RESIST THE RADISHES WHICH IS PRETTY EASY TO RESIST OR RESIST THE COOKIES WHICH IS AT LEAST HARDER TO RESIST AND FOR SOME PEOPLE WOULD BE VERY VERY HARD TO RESIST NOW YOU CAN PROBABLY ALREADY GUESS WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THIS AND SIMILAR STUDIES WAS BECAUSE IT BURTH THIS ENTIRE BELIEF CAMP WITHIN THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY THAT WILL POWER IS A LIMITED RESOURCE THE OUTCOME WAS THAT IF PEOPLE HAD TO RESIST THE COOKIES WHICH IS HARDER TO DO THAN RESISTING THE RADISHES THAT THEY WOULD PERSIST FOR LESS TIME WHEN THEY HAD TO TRY AND SOLVE A PUZZLE THAT UNBENOTE TO THEM COULD NOT BE SOLVED CONVERSELY IF PEOPLE HAD TO RESIST SOMETHING THAT WAS PRETTY EASY TO RESIST SUCH AS RESISTING EATING RADISHES  THAT FOR ME WOULD BE VERY VERY EASY TO RESIST WELL WHEN THEY WERE SUBSEQUENTLY FACED WITH TRYING TO SOLVE A VERY DIFFICULT INDEED IMPOSSIBLE TO SOLVE PUZZLE THEY PERSISTED MUCH LONGER O CASE TO PUT VERY SIMPLY THIS STUDY CONCLUDED THAT IF YOU HAVE TO RESIST ONE THING AN D IT'S A HARD THING TO RESIST WILL THEN YOU HAVE LESS AIR QUOTES HERE RESISTANCE IN YOU WILL POWER TO ENGAGE IN ANOTHER DIFFICULT TASK SUBSEQUENTLY WHEREAS IF YOU HAD AN EASY CHALLENGE JUST PRIOR OR NO CHALLENGE JUST PRIOR TO BEING FACED WITH A CHALLENGE SUCH AS A VERY DIFFICULT PUZZLE WELL THEN YOU HAD MORE RESOURCE MORE WILL POWER TO APPLY TO THE SOLVING OF THAT PUZZLE SO THE CONCLUSION THAT BALL MISTER AND COLLEGES DREW FROM THOSE RESULTS WAS THAT WILL POWER IS A LIMITED RESOURCE BUT IT DIDN'T SPECIFY NOR DID THEY SPECIFY EXACTLY WHAT THAT LIMITED RESOURCE IS ND THIS WAS QUITE AN ATTRACTIVE THEORY BECAUSE IT GIVED WELL WITH MOST PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION OF WHAT WILL POWER AND TENACITY WAS FOR THEM THIS IDEA THAT YES THERE ARE THINGS THAT CHALLENGE US BOTH TO DO AND TO RESIST BUT THAT WE CAN DO THAT BUT WHEN WE ARE ASKED TO DO THAT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN WHILE WE MAY BUILD UP SOME CAPACITY TO ENGAGE OUR WILL POWER AND TENACITY AND OF COURSE THERE ARE THOSE RARE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT AND SOME OF US KNOW THAT SEEM TO HAVE JUST CAN A BOTTOMLESS RESERVOIR OF WILL POWER AND TENACITY MOST OF US HAVE AN ENTUITIVE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW HARD IT IS TO CONSTANTLY BE IN FRICTION WITH LIFE TO CONSTANTLY HAVE TO PUSH OURSELVES TO DO THINGS AN TO RESIST THINGS AND THAT WHILE THAT CAPACITY CAN EXPAND AND GROW WHEN WE CAN GET BETTER AT IT THAT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOMETHING HERE JUST SUBJECTIVELY SPEAKING THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOMETHING ABOUD ENGAGEING TENACITY AND WILL POWER THAT I CAN FEEL GOOD BUT IT ALSO REQUIOR'S EFFORT THIS NURL ENERGY THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SO THAT RAISE THE QUESTION OF O K IF WILL POWER IS A LIMITED RESOURCE WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT RESOURCE AT A PHYSIOLOGICAL LEVEL SO BOW MISTER AND COLLEGUE SUBSEQUENTLY WENT ON TO EXPLORE WHAT I THING IS A REALLY INTERESTING AND CLEVER IDEA FRANKLY I GAN CONFESS THAT I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THIS BUT THEY DID IS IT O K YOU KNOW IN SOME CASES PEOPLE ARE EATING THE COOKIE AND THEN THEY'RE ENGAGING IN THIS S VERY DIFFICULT PUZZLE IN OTHER CASES THEY'RE EATING THE RADISH AND ENGAGING THIS DIFFICULT PUZZLE OF COURSE OTHER EXPERIMENTS USED NON FOOD CHALLENGING CHOICES BUT THEY CAME UP WITH AN IDEA WHICH WAS THE BRAIN AS ONE OF THE MOST METABOLICALLY ACTIVE ORGANS IN OUR ENTIRE BODY IF NOT THE MOST METABOLICALLY ACTIVE ORGAN IN OUR ENTIRE BODY REQUIRES A LOT OF FUEL IT REQUIRES A LOT OF GLUCOSE NOW OF COURSE THE BRAIN MAINLY RUNS ON GLUCOS BUT IF YOU'RE FALLOING A KEETOGENICTIET YOUR BRAIN WILL MAINLY RUN ON KEYTONES BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE OMNIVORES ARE EATING CARBOHYDRATES GLUCOS IS THE MAIN AND PREFERRED FUEL SOURCE FOR NURANTS FOR NERVE CELLS IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY FOR THAT MATTER BALMOISTERING COLLEAGUES RAISED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PERHAPS GLUCOSTS AVAILABILITY ITSELF IS THE RESOURCE THAT'S LIMITING WILL POWER AND IN THE WHOLE SET OF EXPERIMENTS THEY REALLY SHOWED THAT IF PEOPLE ARE ASKED TO DO A DIFFICULT TASS TO ENGAGE THEIR WILL POWER AND THIS COAND BE DONE BY RESISTING A PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR OR BY ENGAGING IN A PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR I'LL JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF ENGAGING IN A PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR THAT REQUIRES WILL POWER OR AT LEAST FOCUS AND MENTAL ENERGY TO CONTRAST IT WITH THE RESISTING RADISHES VERSES RESISTING COOKIES EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE EARLIER ONE COMMON PRACTICE WITHIN EXPERIMENTS LIKE THIS IS TO GIVE PEOPLE A VERY LONG PASSAGE OF WORDS SO ITS A STORY AND THEN TO GIVE THEM SOME SORT OF RULE ABOUT HOW TO ED IT THAT PASSAGE MAYBE THEY HAVE TO CROSS OUT EVERY THIRD E OR THE EASE THAT ARRIVE IN THE MIDDLE OF SENTENCES NEXT TO CONSONENCE BUT NOT OTHER VOWELS OUSTUFF THAT TAKES A LOT OF ENERGY SO THESE ARE DUES AS OPPOSED TO RESISTING BEHAVIORS LIKE WE WERE TALKING OUT EARLIER RESISTING THE RADISH RESISTING THE COOKIES ALTHOUGH IN MANY OF THESE EXPERIMENTS THERE'S A COMMAND TO DO SOMETHING YOU NO CROSS OUT CERTAIN LETTER EASE IN THIS PASSAGE BUT ALSO TO RESIST THE REFLEX TO CROSS OUT OTHER EASE AND OF COURSE ALL THIS IS UNDER TIME PRESSURE AND OFTENTIMES IT'S BEING REWARDED OR S ORED THIS IS THE WAY THAT PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCHERS GET PEOPLE TO ENGAGE IN PARTICULAR A EXPERIMENTS AND BEHAVIORS AND RESIST CERTAIN THINGS IN THE CONTECTS OF LABORATORY ENVIRONMENT WHEN THOSE THINGS FRANKLY ARE KIND OF BORING AND MEANINGLESS THEY'LL PAY YOU MORE IF YOU DO WELL AT THE TASK UM THEY'LL GIVE YOU MONEY AND THEN SUBTRACT THE MONEY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET AT THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT IF YOU MAKE ERRORS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEY'LL DO IT UNDER TIME CONCERNG AS I MENTION EARLIER SO THERE WERE LOTS OF DIFFERENT CONDITIONS FOR AGAIN HERE EREQUOTES DRAINING PEOPLE'S WILL POWER AND TENACITY AND CERTAINLY DRAINING THEIR MENTAL ATTENTION AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE THEM DO ANOTHER SUBSEQUENT TASK SO MANY WAYS THIS JUST MIRRORS THE FIRST COOKY RADISH EXPERIMENT OF MY BOW MYSTERN COLLIES BUT THERE WAS AN IMPORTANT INTERVENTION PUT BETWEEN THE FIRST AND THE SECOND HARD TASK AND THAT INTERVENTION WAS TO GIVE ONE GROUP A GLUCOSE BEVERAGE OF ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY CALORIES OR SO SO THEY WOULD DRINK A GLUCOS BEVERAGE TO INCREASE LEVELS OF BLOOD GLUCOSTS THE PREFERRED FUEL SOURCE FOR THE BRAIN VERSE IS GIVING THEM AND ARTIFICIALLY FLAVOR DRINK OR JUST WATER OR SOMETHING THAT WAS OF COURSE MATCH FOR FLAVOR BUT THAT DID NOT CONTAIN ANY GLUCOS OR CALLORIES NOW THIS IS A CLEVER EXPERIMENTAL ZIGN IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT BECAUSE AT LEAST AT A FIRST GLANCE THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY SEEMS TO BE DIFFERENT IS THE AVAILABILITY OF GLUCOS FOR THE BRAIN AND YOU ARE PROBABLY GUESS WITH THE OUTCOME OF THESE STUDIES WAS THE OUTCOME OF THESE STUDIES WAS THAT WHEN SUBJECTS ARE GIVEN GLUCOS IN BETWEEN A FIRST HARD TASK THAT REQUIRED WILL POWER AND A SECOND HARD TASK THAT REQUIRED WILL POWER AND IN SOME EXPERIMENTS A THIRD HARD TASK THAT REQUIRED WILL POWER THAT THERE LEVELS OF WILL POWER WERE MAINTAINED CONSISTENTLY FROM ONE TASK TO THE NEXT AND IN SOME CASES INCREASED FROM ONE TASK TO THE NEXT IF THEY HAD MORE GLUCOS AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY DRANK THIS GLUCOST DRINK SO WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING AND FRANKLY REALLY NICE ABOUT THESE STUDIES IS THAT THEY ATTEMPTED TO BRIDGE A PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSTRUCT LIKE TENACITY AND WILL POWER AND TO TEST THE ARGUMENT THAT WILL POWER IS AN EXPENDABLE RESOURCE AND YET IT'S AN EXPENDABLE RESOURCE THAT IS REPLENISHABLE BY LINKING THAT TO A PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABLE AND THE PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABLE THEY LINKED IT TO WAS GLUCOS AVAILABILITY IN THE BRAIN NOW THIS SET THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY AND IN FACT THE FIELD OF POPPSYCHOLOGY THAT IS THE DISCUSSION ABOUT FORMAL FINDINGS IN THE FIELD OF FORMAL PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH ABLAZE PEOPLE WERE SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS I MEAN THE SET OF FINDINGS REALLY POINTED TO THE ARGUMENT THAT IF YOU COULD JUST KEEP LEVELS OF BRAIN GLUCOS ELEVATED ACROSS YOUR DAY OR AT LEAST STABLE ACROSS THE DAY THAT YOU WOULD HAVE MORE WILL POWER AND TENACITY THIS THING THAT HUMANS HAVE BEEN SEEKING MORE OF SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME NOW ALL THAT SEEM FIND AND GOOD AND IN FACT A LOT OF PRODUCTS AND COURSES WERE BORN OUT OF THAT LITERATURE PEOPLE WERE ARGUING THAT YOU SHOULD SIP ON A GLUCOS DRINK WHILE DOING ANY KIND OF HARD TASK THAT YOU SHOULD SIP ON GLUCOS DRINKS BETWEEN TASKS THAT YOU SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT LITERALLY FUEL THAT YOU INJEST INTO YOUR BODY AS FUEL FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESSIES WITHIN YOUR BRAIN THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO PERFORM BETTER IN WORK AND SCHOOL IN ATHLETICS AND RELATIONSHIPS AT ALLVE THE DOMAINS OF LIFE BUT OF COURSE ANY TIME THERE IS A PROMINENCE OR A REAL EXCITEMENT ABOUT A PARTICULAR FINDING IN ANY FIELD OF SCIENCE BUT IN PARTICULAR IN PSYCHOLOGY WHERE FIEL SO APPLICABLE AS DID THE BALMISTER RESULTS YOU ARE GOING TO GET OTHER GROUPS THAT ARE GOING TO TRY AND REPLICATE THOSE FINDINGS AND THAT ARE GOING TO DIG INTO THE FINDINGS THEMSELVES AND LOOK AT THE STATISTICS LOOK IT HOW WELL OR POORLY POWERED THOSE STUDIES WERE WE DON'T WANT TO GET INTO A FULL DISCUSSION ABOUT POWERING STUDIES RIGHT NOW BUT POWERING STUDIES HAS A LOT TO DO WITH ADDRESSING THE QUESTION OF WHETHER NOT THERE WERE ENOUGH SUBJECT IN THE STUDY TO REALLY DRAW THE CONCLUSION THAT ONE DREW OR WHETHER OR NOT THE STATISTICS FELL OUT AS YES THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF GLUOS IN GESTION ON WILL P OWER AN TENACITY BUT IF THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH SUBJECTS WELL THEN THERE ARE OTHER VARIABLES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY EXPLAIN THOSE RESULTS SO THERE WERE A LOT OF METANALSIES AND OTHER STUDIES TRYINGTO REPLICATE THE WORK OF BALMISTER AND THAT'S WHERE THINGS GOT CONTROVERSIAL NOW WE CAN TAKE A STEP BACK FROM ALL THAT CONTROVERSY AFTER ALL WE DON'T WANT TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON THE CONTROVERSY ITSELF RATHER WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE COUNTER INTERPRETATION OF THE BALMISTER RESULTS WAS AND I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THERE WAS NO REAL DISPUTE AS TO WHETHER NOT BOWMICER GOT THE RESULTS THAT HE AN HIS COLLEAGUES CLAIM TO HAVE OBTAINED THEY DID GET THOSE RESULTS THE QUESTION REALLY WAS ABOUT THE INTERPRETATION IS WILL POWER LIMITED RESOURCE AND IF IT IS IS THE PHYSIOLOGICAL RESOURCE ITSELF GLUCOS AVAILABILITY TO THE BRAIN SO IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN A COLLEAGUE OF MINE AT STAMFORD DOCTOR CARROLDWEK NOR DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY DID A STUDY IN WHICH SHE EXAMINED THIS IDEA THAT WILL POWERS A LIMITED RESOURCE AND THE IDEA THAT THE RESOURCE THAT'S LIMITED IS GLUCOS AVAILABILITY FOR THE BRAIN SO DOECT AND COLLEAGUES DID AN EXPERIMENT THAT IN MANY WAYS MIRRORED THE OVERALL ORGANIZATION OF THE EXPERIMENTS DONE BY BALMISTER IN CHOLLEAUES THERE WAS A DIFFICULT TASK SOME CASES THE DIFFICULT TASK WAS THAT CROSSING OUT OF PARTICULAR EASE WITHIN A PASSAGE TASK FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER DIFFICULT TASK AND THE DIFFICULT TASK THAT CAME SECOND WAS THE STRUP TASK THIS IS A TASK I'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE ON THIS POD CAST ALTHOUGH SOME EPISODES TO GO SO THOSE OFYOU THAT ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE STROUP TASK THE STROUP TASK IS WHERE SUBJECTS ARE PRESENTED WITH WORDS INDIFFERENT COLORS AND THEY ARE INSTRUCTED TO EITHER READ THE WORD SO TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE CONTENT OF THE WORD OR TO THE COLOR IN WHICH THE FAUNT OF THE WORD IS WRITTEN THIS MIGHT SEEM PRETTY EASY TO MOST OF YOU RIGHT IF I PUT UP O CARD THAT SAYS APPLE ON IT AN APPLE IS WRITTEN IN GREEN YOUPROLLEY WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME IF YOU HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO TELL ME WHAT COLOR IS THE WORD WRITTEN IN F OU TO SATE GREEN OK BUT IF I WERE TO HOLD UP A CARD THAT SAID RED BUT THE FAUNT IS ACTUALLY IN THE COLOR GREEN IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARDER AND IF I WERE TO THEN DO THAT FOR A HUNDRED CARDS OR THREE HUNDRED CARDS AND PUT YOU UNDER TIME PRESSURE WHERE YOU'RE LOSING MONEY THAT YOU'RE SURE TO GET IF YOU MAKE MISTAKES OR YOU WILL EARN MONEY AT THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT IF YOU GET ANSWERS CORRECTLY WELL THEN YOU START MAKING MORE MISTAKES THAT'S JUST THE WAY THESE EXPERIMENTS WORK SO TEY DID A VARIATION ON THE TROUP TASK THAT ISN'T EXACTLY THE WAY I JUST DESCRIBED IT AND THE TROUP TASK BY THE WAY IS ONE THAT'S USED TO PROBE PREFRONTIBLE QUARTEX FUNCTION THIS AREA OF OUR BRAIN RIGHT BEHIND OUR FOREHEADS THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY THINGS BUT IN PART IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTEXT AND STRATEGY SETTING GIVEN A PARTICULAR SET OF RULES SO IF YOU GET ON TO THE BOSS OR GET ON TO THE SUBWAY VERSES WALK IN TO A BLACK TIE DINNER THE CONTEXTS AND RULES ARE VERY VERY DIFFERENT AS TO WHAT YOU WOULD SAY OR NOT SAY HOW YOU BEHAVE HOW YOU ADDRESS YOUR PREFRUNTAL QUARTEX IS LARGELY ALTHOUGH NOT ENTIRELY IS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF THE CONTEXT SETTING AND RULE SETTING FROM ONE SITUATION TO THE NEXT AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE STROUP TASK IT'S REALLY JUST A CONTEXT DEPENDENT STRATEGY TASK YOU EITHER HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE MEANING OF THE WORDS OR THE COLORS IN WHICH THOSE WORDS ARE WRITTEN AND THE NUMBER OF MISTAKES THAT YOU'LL MAKE DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH TIME PRESSURE YOU'RE UNDER WHAT SORTS OF NEUROLOGIC OR PSYCHEATRIC CHALLEGES YOU MIGHT BE FACING OR NOT FACING SO ON AND SO FORTH BUT IT'S A VERY ROBUST TASK THAT EXISTED IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE FOR A LONG PERIOT OV TIME SO THE DIECT EXPERIMENT AND BY THE WAY THEYE WERE ACTUALLY THREE EXPERIMANDS IN THIS PAPER I WON'T GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM IN DETAIL FOR SAKE OF TIME BUT I WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THE PAPER IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS BUT THE MAJOR FOCUST OF THE STUDY WAS TO HAVE PEOPLE ENGAGE IN ONE HARD TASK AND THEN IN ANOTHER HARD TASK BOTH OF WHICH DRAW ON WILL POWER TESTING THE IDEA THAT WILL POWERS A LIMITED RESOURCE AND THEN PROVIDING SOME OF THOSE SUBJECTS WITH A GLUCOS RICH DRINK OR OTHER SUBJECTS WITH A DRINK THAT WAS ARTIFICIALLY SWEETEN SO IT HAD NO GLUCOST NO CALLORIES BUT TASTED YES THEY MATCH THEM FOR TASTE I KNOW SOME DON'T LIKE ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS ORE SAYING THOSE DON'T TASTE EXACTLY LIKE A REAL SUGAR BUT THEY MANAGE TO MATCH THESE DRINKS FOR TASTE BUT IN ONE CASE THE DRINK WOULD CLEARLY INCREASE BLOOD LUCOS IN THE OTHER CASE THE DRINK WOULD NOT RAISE BLOOD LUKOS SO THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY ARE REALLY SPECTACULAR IN MY MIND BECAUSE WHAT THE STUDY FOUND WAS THAT YES INDEED IN JESTING GLUCOST CAN IMPROVE PERFORMANCE ON THESE MULTIPLE CHALLENGING WILL POWER REQUIRING TASKS HOWEVER THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE GLUCOST CONTAINING DRINK COULD IMPROVE PERFORMANCE DEPENDED ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU BELIEVED THAT WILL POWER WAS A LIMITED RESOURCE AND WHETHER NOT YOU BELIEVE THAT RESOURCE WAS GLUCOSE IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU HEAR AND BELIEVE THAT WILL POWER IS A LIMITED RESOURCE WELL THEN INDEED WITH EACH SUBSEQUENT TASK THAT YOU ENGAGE IN OR LIFE EVENT OF ANY KIND THAT YOU ENGAGE IN THAT REQUIRES WILL POWER IN TENACITY YOU WILL HAVE LESS WILL POWER AND TENACITY TO DRAW ON WHEREAS IF YOU BELIEVE THAT WILL POWER AND TENACITY ARE UNLIMITED AND IN FACT ARE DIVORCED FROM BLOOD GLUCOS AS THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SOURCE OF WILL POWER AND TENACITY WELL THEN YOU CAN ENGAGE IN ONE CHALLENGING TASK AND ANOTHER CHALLENGING TASK AND ANOTHER CHALLENGING TASK WITHOUT ANY DIMINISHMENT IN PERFORMANCE NOW THAT OF COURSE LEVES US ALL IN A VERY TOUGH POSITION BECAUSE HOW ARE WE TO DECIDE WHAT TO BELIEVE IF WE KNOW THAT WILL POWER CAN BE A LIMITED RESOURCE OR WILL POWER CANNOT BE A LIMITED RESOURCE AH WELL THE RESULTS OF THE DECT STUDY AND BY THE WAY I SHOULD SHARE WITH YOU THE TITLE OO STUDY THE TITLE THE STUDY NOT SURPRISINGLY IS BELIEFS ABOUT WILL POWER DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF GLUOSE ON SELF CONTROL AND THIS WAS A STUDY PUBLISH IN THE PROSEEDINGS OF HE NATIONAL CATEMY OF SCIENCES AGAIN I'LL PROVIDE A LINK TO THE STUDYIN THE SHOWNO CAPTIONS THEIR THREE MAJOR EXPERIMENTS IN THE STUDY AS I MENTION BEFORE I JUST GAVE YOU THE MAJOR CONCLUSION OF ALL OF THEM TH WOVEN TOGETHER AND IF IT WASN'T CLEAR ALREADY THE MAJOR CONCLUSIONS ARE THAT YES AND JESTING GLUC OS CAN IMPROVE YOUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE TENACITY IN WILL POWER A CASE SELF CONTROL FROM ONE TASK TO THE NEXT PROVIDED THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT GLUCOS IS THE LIMITING RESOURCE FOR ENGAGING TENACITY N WILL POWER IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT WELL THEN YOU CAN ENGAGE TENACITY IN WILL POWER WITHOUT ENGESTING GLUCOS AND THAT'S WHERE THE ARTIFICIALLY FLAVOR DRINK COMES IN I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU TO AND OF UNPACK WHAT THAT MEANS EXPERIMENTALLY BUT IT'S A VERY CLEVER EXPERIMENTAL ZIGN THAT DWECKIN COLLEGUES CAME UP WITH BECAUSE IT ARGUES THAT YES INDEED IT'S HARD TO DO A CHALLENGING THING RIGHT AFTER ANOTHER CHALLENGING THING BUT THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT YOU CAN'T DO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS WHILE ENGAGING THE UTMOST TENACITY IN WILL POWER IF YOU BELIEVE THAT TENACITY IN WILL POWER EXIST WITHIN YOU AS A SINGLE MECHANISM THAT CAN BE HARNEST AND THAT IT'S NOT A SINGLE MECHANISM THAT HAS A RESERVOIR THAT RUNS DOWN AS YOU ENGAGE IN ONE HARD THING TO THE NEXT NOW THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE ARE ABOUT TO TRANSITION INTO OUR DISCUSSION OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL THAT IS THE NURL UNDER PINNINGS OF TENACITY IN WILL POWER WHICH AS IT TURNS OUT IS ONE MAJOR SET OF BRAIN CIRCUITS THER COULD BE OTHERS THAT ARE YET TO BE DISCOVERED BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE IS ONE MAJOR SET OF BRAIN CIRCUITS AN PARTICULAR ONE BRAIN AREA BELIEVE IT OR NOT THAT AN ENTIRE COLLECTION OF MORE THAN TWO DOZEN STUDIES REALLY POINTS TO AS THE SEAT THE ORIGIN OF WHAT WE CALL TENACITY IN WILL POWER BUT BEFORE WE TRANSITION TO THAT AND THE TOOLS AND PROTOCOLS THAT THAT PHYSIOLOGICAL NURL UNDERSTANDING SET FORTH FOR US TO ALL USE AN A PLY I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION THAT BALMISTER WASN'T ABOUT TO HER THESE RESULTS FROM DWECKAN COLLEAGUES AND JUST SAY OKE WILL POWER'S NOT A LIMITED RESOURCE IT'S NOT BLOOD GLUCOSE IT'S ALL WHAT YOU BELIEVE ABOUT WILL POWER 'S ALL WHAT YOU BELIEVE ABOUT BLOOD GLUCOS RATHER BALMISTER HIMSELF WENT BACK TO THE LAB AND DID SUBSEQUENT EXPERIMENTS THAT IN SOME WAYS NO T ALL CALNTER THE DUEC RESULTS SO I'M NOT TRYING TO CONFUSE ANYBODY BUT I WOULDN'T BE DOING MY JOB IF I DIDN'T GIVE YOU BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY NOW THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE TOOLS AND PROTO CALLS THAT WE ARE GOING TO ARRIVE AT WORK REGARDLESS OF WHICH PSYCHOLOGICAL CAMP YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN THE BALMISTER CAMP OR THE DWET CAMP NOW I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THESE ARE WARRING CAMPS AND I ALSO DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THESE ARE THE ONLY TWO CAMPS OF THOUGHT AND EXPERMENTATION WITHIN THE FIELD OF TENACITY AN WILL POWER THERE ARE MANY GROUPS WORKING ON THESE SUBJECTS INDEED THERE HAVE BEEN METANALYSIES THAT HAVE CONFIRMED THE MAJOR THEORIES OF BALMISTER AND THEIRE METANALYSES THAT HAVE REFUTED THE MAJOR FINDINGS OF BALMISTER I WILL PROVIDE LYNKS AN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS TO A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF EACH SO THAT YOU AVE THOSE TO PERUSE IF YOU LIKE BUT LET'S DISCUSS FOR A MOMENT WHAT BALMISTER FOUND WHEN THEY WENT BACK AND RE RESEARCHED THINK THAT'ST A WORD RE RESEARCHE THE IDEA THAT WILL POWERS A LIMITED RESOURCE AND THAT GLUKOS IS THAT LIMITING RESOURCE BALMISTER AND COLLEAGUES LOOKED AT THE DIWECT DATA AND SAID OKEY FIND THE DAY TO LOOK GREAT EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT IN REAL LIFE AND IN MANY PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS THAT THEY AND OTHERS HAD DONE IT WASN'T JUST TWO HARD CHALLENGES BACK TO BACK BUT OFTEN TWO OR THREE OR FOUR AND WHAT BAL MISTER AND OTHERS FOUND WAS THAT WHEN SUBJECTS ARE PRESENTED NOT WITH JUST TWO CHALLENGES BACK TO BACK BUT THREE OR MORE CHALLENGES SO BACK TO BACK TO BACK TO BACK CHALLENGES THAT HAVE TO ENGAGE A LOT OF NURAL ENERGY A LOT OF WILL POWER TENACITY RESISTANCE TO DO CERTAIN THINGS AND EFFORT TO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN KINDS OF BEHAVIORS INCOGNIVE PROCESSES THAT WHEN SUBJECTS HAD GLUCOSES AVAILABLE TO THEM IN THE BRAIN BY WAY OF INJESTING THESE GLUKOST DRINKS SIPPING THOSE IN BETWEEN THE TASKS SOMETIMES EVEN DURING THE TASKS THAT THEIR PERFORMANCE THAT IS THEIR WILL POWER AND TENACITY TO ENGAGE IN CHALLENGES WAS MAINTAINED ACROSS THOSE MULTIPLE CHALLENGES AND THEY CONCEDED THAT ONE'S BELIEF ABOUT WILL POWER COULD INDEED DIC AKE WHETHER OR NOT WILL POWER WAS OR WAS NOT A LIMITED RESOURCE AND WEATHER GLUCOSE WOOD OR WOULD NOT ENHANCE ONE'S ABILITY TO ENGAGE WILL POWER BUT THEY ARGUED THAT IF ONE CONFRONTS MULTIPLE CHALLENGING CIRCUMSTANCES AS IS VERY NATURALISTIC AS WE SAY IT'S VERY TYPICAL OF EVERY DAY REAL LIFE THEN THE AVAILABILITY OF GLUCOST DURING AND BETWEEN TASKS THE ABILITY FOR THE BRAIN TO ENGAGE IN ITS EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT AND TAKE REEDS OF ITS INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT HOW WE FEEL INSIDE RELATIVE TO WHAT'S EXPECTED OF US WAS VERY VALUABLE IN ALLOWING PEOPLE TO ENGAGE THIS THING THAT PSYCHOLOGICALLY WE DESCRIBE AS TENACITY AND WILL POWER ID LIKE TO JUST TAKE A BRIEF BREAK AND THANK ONE OF OUR SPONSORS WHICH IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR NOW SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS NOW PEOPLE OF COURSE HAVE VARYING LEVELS OF REQUIREMENTS FOR SODIUM SO PEOPLE WITH HYG PRETENSION OR PREHY PRETENSION PROBABLY SHOULDN'T INCREASE THEIR SODIUM HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED TO FIND THAT BY INCREASING THEIR SODIU MEN TAKE THEY ARE ABLE TO FUNCTION BETTER COGNIVELY AND PHYSICALLY AN THAT'S BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SPECIALLY PEOPLE ARE FALLING LOW CARBOHYDRATE OR EVEN MODERATE CARBOHYDRATE AND REALLY CLEAN DIETS OFTENTIMES ARE EXCREETING A LOT OF WATER AN ELECTROLYTES ALONG WITH IT AND SIMPLY BY INCREASING THEIR ELECTROLITE INTAKE USING ELEMENT THEY JUST FEEL BETTER AND FUNCTION BETTER I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES END WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND CERTAINLY I DRINK ELEMENT IN MY WATER WHEN IAM IN THE SANA AND AFTER GOING IN THE SONA BECAUSE THAT CAUSES QUITE A LOT OF SWEATING IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMNT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT DOC COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT ELEEMENT DOC O M SLASH HUBERMAN LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PHYSIOLOGY OF TENCITY IN WILL POWER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT THE CONVERSATION WE ARE ABOUT TO HAVE IS NOT GOING TO BE JUST A BUNCH OF NOMING CLAY CHURE AND MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE ORIGINS OF TENACITY IN WILL POWER RATHER IT ARGUES THAT TENACITY IN WILL POWER HAVE A UNIFIED SOURCE THAT IS A SPECIFIC SET OF BRAIN AREAS THAT WHEN ACTIVE ENGAGE THAT FEELING OF TENACITY IN WILL POWER REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE ARE CONFRONTED WITH REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT WE ARE TRYING TO ENGAGE IN SOMETHING THAT REFLECIVELY WE WOULDN' OTHERWISE WANT TO ENGAGE IN AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHEROR NOT WE ARE CONFRONTED WITH SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO RESIST AND TO ME THAT'S EXTREMELY REASSURING BECAUSE WHETHER OR NOT YOU BELIEVE THAT BLOOD GLUCOS IS THE LIMITING RESOURCE FOR WILL POWER WHETHER OR NOT YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR BELIEFS ABOUT WILL POWER AND BLOOD LUKOS IMPACT YOUR LEVEL O WILL POWER WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE IS THAT THERE'S A SINGLE SET OF BRAIN CIRCUITS INDEED THERE'S A SINGLE BRAIN AREA THAT SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO LARGELY IF NOT ENTIRELY EXPLAIN THIS PHENOMENON THAT WE CALL TENACITY AN WILL POWER AND THAT SHOULD BE REASSURING BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT TENACITY IN WILL POWER IS THE REFLECTION OF A NORL CIRCUIT FUNCTION THAT IS A SKILL IT'S AN EXPRESSION OF SOMETHING THAT WE ALL HAVE WITHIN US WE ALL HAVE THIS PARTICULAR BRAIN AREA AND QUITE EXCITINGLY THIS IS THE THIRD POINT THIS BRAIN AREA IS HIGHLY SUBJECT TO PLASTICITY THERE ARE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT WE CAN DO AND THEIR SPECIFIC MIND SETS THAT WE CAN ADOPT THAT ALLOW US TO INCREASE THE ACTIVITY OF THIS PARTICULAR BRAIN AREA INDEED TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF THIS PARTICULAR BRAIN AREA SO THAT WE CAN CALL ON TENACITY IN WILL POWER NOT JUST IN ONE CIRCUMSTANCE LIKE SCHOOL OR MUSICAL LEARNING OR ATHLETIC ENDEAVORS OR RELATIONSHIP ENDEAVORS BUT RATHER THAT WE CAN CALL ON THIS BRAIN AREA IN THE CONTEXT OF ANY AND ALL CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WILL POWER AND TENACITY ARE REQUIRED NOW WE TALK ABOUT NERL SIGNS A LOT ON THIS PODCAST BUT IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT I POINT TO A PARTICULAR BRAIN AREA AND CAN CONFIDENTLY SAY THIS PARTICULAR BRAIN AREA HAS AND ABSOLUTELY INTERGRAL ROLL IN SOMETHING AS AND OF HIGH LEVEL PSYCHOLOGICAL AS TENACITY IN WILL POWER BUT TO DAY WE CAN DO THAT AND THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S A COLLECTION OF MORE THAN TWO DOZEN STUDIES THAT POINT TO ONE PARTICULAR BRAIN AREA AND OF COURSE ITS CONNECTIONS WITH OTHER BRAIN AREAS BECAUSE NO SINGLE BRAIN AREA OPERATES AN ISOLATION EVERY BRAIN AREAS OPERATING IN THE CONTECTS OF NORAL CIRCUITS OTHER BRAIN AREAS THAT IT RECEIVES IM PUTS FROM MEN GIVES IN PUTS TO AND SO ON BUT THIS ONE PARTICULAR BRAIN AREA REALLY DOES SEEM TO UNDERLY WHAT WE CALL TENACITY AND WILL POWER AND WE KNOW THAT THROUGH SEVERAL LINES OF EVIDENCE FIRST OF ALL I'LL ELL YOU THE NAME OF THE BRAIN AREA ALTHOUGH THE NAME ITSELF IS N'T GOING TO TELL YOU MUCH UNLESS YOUR NAROW SCIENTIST AR ANATOMIS SILL GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ABOUT IT THE NAME OF THE BRAIN AREA IS THE ANTERIOR MID SINGULATE QUARTEX THE ANTEROR MID SINGULATE QUARTEX IS PART OF A LARGER BRAIN AREA CALLED THE SINGULATE QUARTEX AND INHUMANS VERSES ANIMALS IT GOES BY SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT NAMES UNFORTUNATELY IS JUST ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF DIFFERENT RESEARCHERS IN DIFFERENT LABS CALLING THE SAME THING DIFFERENT THINGS O BE REALLY FRUSTRATING BUT WILL MAKE IT VERY SIMPLE BECAUSE TODAY WE WIRE REFER TO THIS AREA AS THE ANTERIOR MID SINGULATE QUARTEX WHICH IS A SUB DIVISION OF A LARGER BRAIN AREA SIMPLY CALLED THE SINGULATE QUARTEX THE ANTERIOR MID SINGULATE QUARTEX RESIDES IN THE FRONTAL LOPES SO IT'S BEHIND YOUR FOREHEAD ALTHOUGH THAT DOESN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING BECAUSE ALL OF YOUR BRAIN IS BEHIND YOUR FOREHEAD IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND IT'S ABOUT A THIRD OF THE WAY BACK TOWARD THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD AND YOU A HLY HAVE TWO OF THESE STRUCTURES TWO ANTERIOR MID SINGULATE QUARTESEES ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE BRAIN AND THEY RECEIVE A LOT OF IM PUTS FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS AND WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT THOSE AREAS ARE BECAUSE IS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WHEN THINKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLO GICAL RESOURCES THAT YOU CAN DRAW UPON TO ENGAGE TENACITY IN WILL POWER BUT FOR THE TIME BEING I MAY JUST GO THROUGH THE EVIDENCE AND KIND OF LIST FORM AT BOF WHY WE FEEL SO CONFIDENT THAT THE INTER MIDSINGULAT QUARTEX IS SUCH A VITAL HUB FOR ENGAGING TENACITY AN WILL POWER FOR EACH OF THESE POINTS THAT I'M ABOUT TO MAKE THERE IS INDEED AT LEAST ONE IF NOT SEVERAL QUALITY PURE REVIEWED STUDIES IN HUMAN S SO THERE'S A LOT OF DATA FROM ANIMALS BOTH RHODANS AND PRIMATE MODELS ET CETERA THAT WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT TODAY BUT I SHOULD MENTION ALL OF WHICH SUPPORTS THE HUMAN DATA AND VICE VERSA THE DATA I'M GOING TO DESCRIBE NOW COME FROM HUMANS AND FROM A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF STUDIES SO THERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT ONE CAN CONSIDER IF A BRAIN AREA IS IMPLICATED AND A GIVEN PSYCHOLOGICAL OR PHYSIOLOGICAL PHENOMENON LIKE MOTIVATION OR SADNESS OR VISUAL PERCEPTION AND THOSE INCLUDE FOR INSTANCE IF A BRAIN AREA IS ACTIVE DURING A GIVEN PHENOMENON SO ONE WAY TO EXPLORE THIS IS TO PUT LITERALLY WIRE ELECTRODES DOWN BELOW THE SKULL RECORD THE ELECTUR ACTIVITY OF NURONS AND ASSESS WHETHER NOT THE ELECTRICA ELECTIVITY OF THOSE NARON CHANGES WHEN A PERSON IS SAV VIEWING FACES OR FEELING A PARTICULAR WAY LIKE FEELING TENACIOUS OR FEELING BORD OR FEELING AGGRESSIVE AND SO ON ANOTHER WAY OF ASSESSING A PARTICULAR BRAIN AREAS ROLL IN A GIVEN PHYSIOLOGICAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL PHENOMENON IS IN INDIVIDUALS WHERE THAT PARTICULAR BRAIN AREA IS INJURED YOU MIGHT EXPECT THAT A PARTICULAR PHENOMENON LIKE WILL POWER LIKE THE ABILITY TO PERCEIVE FACES IS PRESENT OR ABSENT WHETHER NOTIS EXASCERBATED OR WHETHER NOT ITS DIMINISHED OTHER WAYS OF ASSESSING WHETHER NOT A GIVEN BRAIN AREAS INVOLVED IN A GIVEN PHENOMENON IS WHETHEROR NOT THAT BRAIN AREA LITERALLY CHANGES SIZE WHETHER NOT CHANGES IN VOLUME OVER THE COURSE OF SOME SORT OF TRAINING SO FOR INST ANCE IF SOMEBODY IS NOT ABLE TO PLAY A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT SUCH AS MYSELF AND THEN I OR A SUBJECT IN ONE OF THESE EXPRES RMENTS LEARNS A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT AND THE VOLUME THE SIZE OF THE PARTICULAR BRAINAREA IS A SESSED ACROSS THE LEARNING OR SIMPLY BEFORE AND AFTER THAT MUSICAL LEARNING AND IT GROWS OR PERHAPS EVEN IF IT SHRINKS OR CHANGE OF SHAPE ONE MIGHT DETERMINED THAT IT IS SOMEHOW SOMEHOW INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS OF LEARNING A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT YOU COULDN'T AN EQUIVOCALLY CONCLUDE THAT BUT ALONG WITH OTHER TYPES OF EVIDENCE ONE COULD PERHAPS CONCLUDE THAT SO THAT'S JUST THE PARTIAL LIST OF WAYS TO ASSESS BRANAREA FUNCTION OTHER WAYS INCLUDE ASSESSING WHAT OTHER AREAS A GIVEN BRANARY GETS IN PUT FROM SO FOR INSTANCE IN THE CASE OF THE ANTERIOR MIDSINGULA QUARTECS WE WILL SOON DISCUSS THE FACT THAT IT GETS ROBUST INPUT FROM THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH YOU ALREADY LEARNED ABOUT IT GETS ROBUST INPUT FROM REWARD SYSTEMS OF THE BRAIN SUCH AS THE DOPOMINE AND SERETONAN BASED REWARD SYSTEMS OF THE BRAIN AND IT GETS ROBUST INPUT FROM THE ONTEXT AND STRATEGY SETTING AREAS OF THE BRAIN AS WELL AND MANY OTHER DIFFERENT BRAIN AREAS SO THERE'S A STRUCTURAL LOGIC AS TO WHY THE ANTERAMIDSINGULAT QUARTEX WOULD BE INVOLVED IN TENACITY IN WILL POWER BUT NO SINGLE ANATOMICAL OR PHYSIOLOGICAL OR LESION BASED FINDING IS AS COMPELLING AS WHEN WE CONSIDER ALL OF THE RESULTS ABOUT THE ANTERAMID SINGULAT QUARTEC TOGETHER AND SIDE BY SIDE SO FOR INSTANCE RECORDINGS BY NEURAL IMAGING OF THE ANTERMID SINGULAT QUARTECS IN AN UNBIASED WAY MEANING PEOPLE ARE PUT INTO A BRAIN SCANNER AND BRAIN ACTIVITY IS EXAMINED AND MASS ALL OF THE BRAIN AREAS ARE LOOKED AT AND PEOPLE ARE PRESENTED WITH EITHER A HARD TASK OR AN EASY TASK REVEALED THAT THE ANTER AMID SINGULAT QUARTECS SHOWS ELEVATED LEVELS OF ACTIVITY IN THE HARD VERSES THE EASY TASK AND AGAIN I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE RESEARCHERS WERE NOT LOOKING FOR THAT RESULT THEY SIMPLY OBSERVED THAT RESULT IN ADDITION IF PEOPLE WHO EXHIBIT HIGH LEVELS OF ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT SUBJECS ARE PUT INTO A BRAIN SCANNER THAT EVALUATES SO CALLED RESTING STATE CONACTIVITY SO NO TASK BUT SIMPLY LEVELS OF ACTIVITY IN DIFFERENT BRAINAREAS THAT OCCUR SPONTANEOUSLY ATO THEY ARE JUST SITTING IN THE SCANNER LOOKING AT A BLANK SCREEN THE RESTING OR SPONTANEOUS LEVELS OF ACTIVITY IN THE ANTERIOR MIDSINGULAT QUARTEX OF HIGH ACHIEVING INDIVIDUALS IS HIGHER RELATIVE TO THOSE OF LOWER ACHIEVING INDIVIDUALS IN ADDITION PEOPLE THAT HAVE LEISIONS OR DESRUPTIONS OF ANTERIOR MIDSINGULAT QUARTICAL FUNCTION SHOW INCREASED APATHY AND DEPRESSION AND REDUCE LEVELS OF TENACITY AND MOTIVATION ACROSS THE BOARD REGARDLESS OF WHAT DOMAIN OF LIFE ONE IS ASKING ABOUT WHETHER NOT ATHLETIC OR ACADEMIC ET CETERA INDEED SUCCESSFUL DIETORS SHOW ELEVATED SPONTANEOUS END WHAT'S CALLED EVOKED LEVELS OF ACTIVITY IN THE ANTERMIDSINGULAT QUARTEC SO SPONTANEOUS AGAIN JUST AT REST THEY HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF ACTIVITY IN THE ANTERMID SINGULA QUARTEX AND FOR THOSE THAT ARE PRESENTED WITH FOOD AND THE HAVE TO RESIST THAT FOOD AND THEY AVE TO RESIST THE SMELL OF THAT FOOD AND THE POTENTIAL TASTE OF THAT FOOD THE ACTIVITY OF THE ANTERYMIDSINGULAT QUARTECS GOES UP EVEN FURTHER ESPECIALLY IN THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN RESIST THAT IS WHO CAN ENGAGE WILL POWER TO NOT EAT THE DELICIOUS FOOD ITEM CONVERSELY INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE FAILED TO EXERT SUFFICIENT WILL POWER TO LOSE THEIR DESIRED WEIGHT AND THIS WAS FOR MEDICAL REASONS RELATED SO TRYING TO ACHIEVE MEDICAL HEALTH AS WELL AS PEOPLE WHO ARE OBEASTS SEEM TO HAVE DIMINISHED LEVELS OF ACTIVITY IN THE ANTER MID SINGULAT QUARTEX IN ADDITION PEOPLE WHO ARE DEPRESSED WHO EXPRESS A LOT OF APATHY AND HERE WE'RE TOING ABOUT CLINICALLY DIAGNOST MAJOR DEPRESSION SHOW REDUCED LEVELS OF ACTIVITY IN THE ANTERMID SINGULAT QURTEX HUMANS THAT EXPRESS A LOT OF WHATS CALLED LEARNED HELPLESSNESS THAT IS THEY HAVE ADOPTED THE BELIEF IN THE ACTIONS ASSOCIATE WITH THE BELIEF THAT NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO THE OUTCOMES ARE NOT GOING TO BE WHAT THEY DESIRE EXPRESS LOWER LEVELS OF NERRAL ACTIVITY IN THE ANTERMIDSINGLAT QUA RTE COUN SEE THIS LIST GOES ON AND ON BUT IT IN FACT GETS EVEN MORE INTERESTING NEMBER EARLIER I MENTION THAT SUCCESSFUL DIETERS HAVE ELEVATED LEVELS OF NEURAL ACTIVITY IN THE ANTER AMID SINGULAT QUARTEX NOW THAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE A GOOD THING AND INDEED IT CAN BE A GOOD THING BUT THERE'S A PATHOLOGIC CONDITION ASSOCIATED WITH DIETING AND ONE'S ABILITY TO ENGAGE WILL POWER AND RESIST FOOD AND THAT'S IN THE CASE OF EATING DISORDERS SUCH AS ANEREXIA NERVOSA NOW 'VE DONE A HUBER MANLABPODCAST SOLO EPISODE ABOUT ANEREI NERVOSA NDON THAT PODCAST I MADE THE POINT THAT I'LL MAKE AGAIN NOW WHICH IS THAT ANEREXIA NERVOSA IS THEMOS DEADLY OF ALL THE PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS LEADING TO DEATH IN A VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE IT NOW FORTUNATELY THERE ARE TREATMENTS AND MORE EMERGING ALL THE TIME BUT IT'S A VERY SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITION THAT IS EXTREMELY DEADLY INDIVIDUALS WITHANEREXIA NERVOSA EXHIBIT HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF ACTIVITY IN THEIR ANTER MIDSINGULAT QUARTEX BOTH AT REST AND WHEN PRESENTED WITH FOOD NOW DON'T WANT TO GO ON A FULL TANSIENT ABOUT ANEREXA BECAUSE WE COVERED ANEREXIA ON THE PREVIOUS PODCAST EPISODE ABOUT ANEREXIA WHICH BY THE WY YOU CAN FIND AT HUBERMAN LAUGHED OUT CALM SIMPLY SEARCH ANEREXIA OR EATING DISORDERS WITHIN THE SEARCH FUNCTION BUT ONE OF THE CLEAR SYMPTOMS OF ANEREXIA NERVOSA IS THAT THE REWARD PATHWAYS OF THE BRAIN WHICH WE KNOW FEED INTO THAT IS SEND DIRECT CONNECTIONS TO THE ANTERIOR MID SINGULAT QUARTEX SEEM TO BE ACTIVATED UNDER CONDITIONS IN WHICH PEOPLE WITH ANEREXIA AVOID FOOD AS APPOSE TO EAT FOOD AND THEN THERE'S A VERY INTERESTING AND POSITIVE LITERATURE ABOUT SO CALLED SUPER AGERS SO WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE IS THAT AS PEOPLE AGE IN PATICULAR BETWEEN THE AGES OF SIXTY AND NINETY THERE 'S A REDUCTION IN THE SIZE OF MANY BRAIN AREAS BUT THE ANTERIOR MIDSINGULAT QUARTEX IN PARTICULAR UNLESS CERTAIN THINGS ARE DONE TO OFFSET THAT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THOSE PARTICULAR THINGS ARE JUST A FEW MINUTES BUT THE IS A PARTICULAR CATEGORY OF HUMANS THAT'S ALIVE NOW AND THAT LIVE A VERY LONG TIME THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT STAND THE GREATEST CHANCE OF BECOMING SENTENARIANS AND MANY OF THEM ARE SENTENARIANS SO CALLED SUPER AGERS BUT ALSO WITHIN THE CATEGORY OF SUPER AGERS OUR PEOPLE WHO ARE SIXTY YEARS OLD OR MORE BECAUSE NOT ALL OF THEM HAVE REACHED EIGHTY NINETY YET AND HAVE THE COGNITION OF FORTY YEAR OLDS THIRTY YEAR OLDS AND OFTEN EVEN OF PEOPLE IN THEIR MID TWENTIES NOW THEREARE LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT ABOUT THESE SUPER AGERS SUPER AGERS IN THE SENSE THAT THEY ARE MAINTAINING VERY YOUTHFUL LEVELS OF COGNITION BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BECOME VERY APPARENT FROM THE NORIMAGING DATA IS THAT SUPER AGERS MAINTAIN A VOLUME ASIZE OF THE ANTER MID SINGULAT QUARTEC THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN THEIR AGE MATCHED COHORTS SO THE EXCITING THING IS THAT THERERE MANY MANY LINES OF EVIDENCE POINTING TO THE FACT THAT THE ANTERMID SINGULAT QUARTEC AT LEAST HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE TENACITY AND WILL POWER AND THAT IT WHEN ACTIVE MOVES US UP THAT CONTINUUM AWAY FROM APATHY AND DEPRESSION TOWARD STATES OF BEING ABLE TO ENGAGE IN OR RESIST PARTICULAR TYPES OF BEHAVIORS SO WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED AS A BUNCH OF NEUROIMAGING STRUCTURAL VOLUME DATA BLOOD UP TAKE DATA LEGION STUDIES AND SO ON AND SO FORTH BUT WE CAN SIMPLIFY ALL OF THAT AND IN FACT ADDRESS SOMETHING THAT PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE SAID EARLIER WHICH IS THAT WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TENACITY IN WILL POWER WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT ONE OF TWO THINGS WE ARE EITHER TALKING ABOUT THAT SENSE WITHIN US THAT HAS US SAYING I WILL NO MATTER WHAT YOU TELL ME NO MATTER WHAT YOU PUT IN FRONT OF ME NO MATTER WHAT IS ROLLED MY WAY I WILL BLANK NOW THE OTHER EXPRESSION OF TENACITY AN WILL POWER IS THAT WITHIN US WITHIN YOU WITHIN ME WHEN TENASIT IN WILL POWER ARE ACTIVE WE HAVE THAT SENSE WITHIN US THAT FEELING IN OUR BODY AND THAT THOUGHT PATTERN AKE AA FEELING IN OUR BRAIN THAT NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO NO MATTER WHAT YOU PUT IN FRONT OF ME I WON'T SO REALLY WILL POWER IS EITHER AN EXPRESSION OF I WILL OR I ABSOLUTELY WILL IS PERHAPS A BETTER WAY TO STATE IT OR I ABSOLUTELY WON'T NOW THAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE JUST A SIMPLE SUBJECTIVE REORDERING OF A BUNCH OF PHYSIOLOGICAL DATA AND PSYCHOLOGY STUDIES BUT IT'S NOT ITS ACTUALLY FAR MORE IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THIS I ABSOLUTELY WILL AND I ABSOLUTELY WON'T ASPECT OF WILL POWER BECAUSE IF INDEED THERE IS A SINGLE BRAIN AREA THAT CAN GOVERN WILL POWER AND WILL POWER IS NOT ONE BUT IS AT LEAST TWO THINGS THE SENSE OF I ABSOLUTELY WILL NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY DO ET CETERA WHERE I ABSOLUTELY WON'T NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY DO ET CETERA WILL THEN THIS BRAIN AREA CAN'T BE A SIMPLE SWITCH IT CAN'T BE WILL POWER ON WILL POWER OFF WILL POWER ON WILL POWER OFF IT CAN'T BE ABSOLUTE AS WE SAY IT MUST BE GRATED IT MUST HAVE LEVELS SO IT'S MORE LIKE A SLIDER ON A LIGHT SWITCH THAN AN ON VERSES OFF LIGHT SWITCH IN ADDITION TO THAT IF THERE IS TRULY ONE BRAIN AREA THAT PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN GENERATING TENACITY AND WILL POWER AND TENACITY IN WILL POWER SOMETHING THAT 'SREQUIRED FROM US IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT CONTECTS WHERE WE HAVE TO SAY I ABSOLUTELY WILL YES THIS I ABSOLUTELY WON'T KNOW THAT I ABSOLLY WILL ALSO YES THIS ET CETERA ET CETERA Y BECAUSE LIFE AS COMPLEX EVEN JUST THE SIMPLE THING OF SAY DIETING OR TRYING TO GET A PARTICULAR DEGREE OR TRYING TO NAVIGATE EVEN A SIMPLE ILLNESS I COM O GET THROUGH THIS WEAK DESPITE FEELING LOUSY I'M GOING TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF MYSELF ALL THESE THINGS IN SOME SENSE REQUIRE R TENACITY AND WILL POWER AND THE BEHAVERS WE NEED TO ENGAG IN AND AVOID ENGAGING IN H VERY DYNAMIC DEPENDING NOT JUST ON WHO WE ARE AN WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO OR NOT DO BUT ALSO WHERE WE ARE THAT DAY THAT MOMENT WELL THAT MEANS THAT THE ANTER AMID SINGULAT QUARTE ALSO NEEDS ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT CONTEXT IT NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S REWARDING OR NON REWARDING IN THE CONTECTS OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH NOT JUST WHAT FEELS GOOD IN THE MOMENT NOW FORTUNATELY THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF STUDIES EXPLORING NOT JUST THE ACTIVITY LEVELS OF THE ANTERMID SINGULAT QUARTEX OR THE SIZE OF THE ANTERMIDSINGULA QURTEX IN THE VARIOUS CONDITIONS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE DEPRESSION OB CITY SUCCESSFUL DIETERS SUCCESSFUL STUDENTS SUCCESSFUL ATHLETES ET CETERA BUT A LOT OF ANATOMICAL TRACING STUDIES BOTH FROM FIXED THAT IS FROM DEAD BRAIN TISSUE SO POSTMORTEM BRAIN TISSUE IN HUMANS BUT ALSO NOWADAYS THERE CERTAIN TYPES OF NERRO IMAGING PARTICULAR SOMEHY CALLED DIFFUSION TENS OR IMAGING THAT E LOWS ONE TO EXAMINE THE FLOW OF INFORMATION IN AND OUT OF DIFFERENT BRAIN AREAS THROUGH SO CALLED WHITE MATTER TRACKS TRACKS MEANING T ARE A C T S TRACKS SO THESE ARE THE WIRES THAT CONNECT NARRONS ARE CALLED AC ONS AND THOSE ACTS ONS ARE IN SHEATHE WITH A FATTY SUBSTANCE CALLED MILIN AND THAT IN SCHEATHMEN WITH MILAN ALLOWS THEM TO TRANSMIT INFORMATION VERY QUICKLY YOU'LL SEE WHERE I'M GOING WITH ALL THIS IN JUST A MOMENT AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THE ENTERER MID SINGULATE QUARTEC AGAIN OF WHICH YOU HAVE ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE BRAIN ABOUT A THIRD OF THE WAY BACK FROM YOUR FOREHEAD TO THE BACK YOUR BRAIN APPROXIMATELY RIGHT ABOVE THE SO CALED CORPUS COLOSUM THIS VERY ROBUST COLLECTION OF WHITE MATTER TRACKS THAT CONNECTS THE TWO SIDES OF THE BRAIN WELL IT GETS IN PUT AND SENDS IM PUT TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BRAIN AREAS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING AUTONOMIC CENTERS THAT CONTROL FOR INSTANCE CARDVASCULAR FUNCTION INCREASES OR DECREASES IN HEART RATE RESPIRATION HOW FAST AND HOW DEEPLY YOU BREATHE OR HOW SHALL OWLY AND SLOWLY YOU BREATHE IMMUNE SYSTEM IN PUTS AN OUTPUTS WITH THE SPLEEN NOT DIRECTLY BUT THROUGH A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT STATIONS WITH THE VERY ORGANS IN YOUR BODY THAT CAN RELEASE BECELLS IND TEACELLS AND IMMUNE MOLECULES THAT CAN COMBAT BACTERIAL VIRAL AND FUNGLE INFECTIONS AND THAT CAN REPAIR PHYSICAL WOUNDS END IT COMMUNICATES WITH THE ENDICRAN SYSTEM WITH THE SYSTEMS OF THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT RELEASE FOR INSTANCE ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTRONE WHICH BY THE WAY ARE PRESENT IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES AND ON A PREVIOUS EPISODE O THE HURAN LADPODCASTS WITH ROBERT SUPOLSKI IS MY GUEST WE TALKED ABOUT FOR INSTANCE THE ROLL OF TESTASTRONE AND MANY PEOPLE THINK OU TESTOSTRONE IS ALL ABOUT AGGRESSION TESTOSTRONE IS ALL ABOUT ATTACK TESTOTRONE IS ALL ABOUT MADING THAT IS COMPLETELY FALSE WHILE IT CAN BE INVOLVED IN THOSE DIFFERENT PROCESSES WHAT DOCTRO SPOLSKAN I DISCUSSED IS THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR FUNCTIONS OF TESTOSTRONE IN THE BRAIN IS TO MAKE EFFORT FEEL GOOD AND YOU CAN SEE AND WELL TALK A LA BIT MORE ABOUT HOW THAT LINKS UP VERY DIRECTLY WITH THIS CONCEPT OF TENACITY IN WILL POWER SO THE FIRST POINT IS THAT THE ENTERMIDSINGULAT QUARTECS IS INDIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH ALL THE AREAS OF THE BRAIN AND THROUGH A COUPLE OF OTHER STATIONS THE BODY THAT MODULATE OUR SENSE OF TENACITY IN WILL POWER WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THE NEED FOR SLEEP THE NEED FOR PAIN OR LACK OF PAIN OR EMOTIONAL COMFORT OR DISCOMFORT TO MODULATE ARE LEVEL OF TENACITY IN WILL POWER THE INTERMID SINGULAT QUARTEXIS ALSO DIRECTLY LINKED UP WITH PREMOTOR CENTERS THESE ARE THE CENTERS OF THE BRAIN THAT ORGANIZE PARTICULAR PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR AND INDEED THAT CAN SUPPRESS PARTICULAR PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR AS I TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY FILLING IN THE BLANKS THIS IS ENGAGING IN A BEHAVIOR OR RESISTING A BEHAVIOR THE INTERMID SINGULAT QUARTEX IS ALSO DIRECTLY WIRED IN WITH THE REWARD PATHWAYS OF THE BRAIN CAN TRIGGER THE RELEASE OF DOPAMING THAT CAN ALSO RESPOND TO THE RE LISE OF DOPAMY AND THAT DOPOMEN RELEASE COULD BE GENERATED BEHAVIORLY IT COULD BE GENERATED THROUGH SOME SORT OF FOOD REWARD IT COULD BE PARMICALOGIC THERE ARE NUMBER DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THE ENTER AMID SINGULAR QUARTE THE POINT HERE IS THAT IT IS IN DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH THE ENTER MID SINGULAR QUARTEX AND THE INTER MID SINGULAR QUARTEX IS IN DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM AND WHAT I JUST GAVE YOU IS FRANKLY JUST A PARTIAL LIST OF THE DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE COMMUNICATING ROBUSTLY WITH THE ENTER AMID SINGULAR QUARTEX IT GETS INFORMATION ABOUT INTERROCEPTION ARE READ OUT OF HOW WE FEEL IN OUR BODY IT ALSO HAS ROBUST INPUTS AN OUTPUTS WITH THE AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE ASSOCIATE WITH EXTER RECEPTION ARE PERCEPTION OF WHAT IS OUT AROUND US SO ALL OF THAT PROVIDES A LOGICAL BASIS FOR THE NERO IMAGING DATA THE LESION DATA THE VOLUMETRIC DATA THAT WE TALKED ABOUT A FEW MINUTES AGO IN THE CONTECTS OF DEPRESSION ANXIETY HIGH PERFORMANCE AND EREXIA AND SO ON BUT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ARGUMENTS THAT'S EVER BEEN MADE IN FAVOR OF THE INTER AMID SINGULAR QUARTEX BEING A MAJOR SEAT FOR TENACITY AND WILL POWER COMES FROM DOCTOR LESA FELDMEN BEAR IT WHO IS SOON TO BE A GUEST ON THEHUVERMANLAPOTCAST WE'VE ACTUALLY RECORDED THAT EPISODE ALREADY IN IT SHOULD BE OUT VERY SOON LISA'S LABORATORY IS WELL KNOWN FOR PIONEERING RESEARCH ON EMOTION AND AFFECT I STRONGLY INCURAGE YOU TO LISTEN TO THAT EPISODE ONCE IT COMES OUT AND IT WAS ACTUALLY LISA HERSELF THAT CUED ME TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE NTER MID SINGULAR QUARTEX AND LISON COLLEAGUES HAVE WRITTEN SEVERAL SPECTACULAR REVIEWS ABOUT THE INTER AMID SINGULA QUARTEX AND ITS ROLL IN TENACITY AND MOTIVATION I WILL PROVIDE LINK TO A FEW OF THOSE IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS ONE THAT I'M PARTICULARLEY EXCITED ABOUT ONE THAT I'VE SPENT NOW AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF TIME WITH IS ENTITLED THE TENACIOUS BRAIN HOW THE INTERMIDSINGULA QUARTEX CONTRIBUTES TO ACHIEVING GOALS IF YOU AVE A BACKGROUND IN BIOLOGY EVEN IF YOU DON'T THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT REVIEW TO BE VERY INTERESTING AND IT FURTHER SUBSTANTIATES LOT OF THE POINTS THAT I MADE A FEW MOMENTS AGO ABOUT THE DIFFERENT SENARIOS AND TYPES OF INDIVIDUALS THAT SEEM TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE THEIR INTER MIDSINGULAT QUARTEX UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS AND TO A GREATER OR LESSER EXTENT THAN OTHERS SO HAT'S OFF TO LISA FORCUING ME TO THIS INCREDIBLY INTERESTING BRAINSTRUCTUR I HAD KNOWN THAT IT EXISTED DR ALLI TEACHNERANATOMY TO MEDICAL STUDENTS AT STAMFORD AND I TAUGHT NERANATOMY FOR MANY MANY YEARS BUT I DON'T THINK ENOUGH PEOPLE AND INDEED VERY FEW PROFESSIONAL NORW SCIENTIST COULD TELL YOU WHAT THE ANTEROR MIDSINGULAT UARTEX DOES BUT IT HAS THIS APPARENTLY INCREDIBLE FUNCTION IN GENERATING TENACITY IN MOTIVATION ALONG THOSE LINES ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE AND IMPORTANT STUDIES ABOUT THE INTER MIDSINGULAT QUARTEX AND ITS CAPACITY TO GENERATE FEELINGS OF TENACITY IN WILL POWER COMES FROM ONE OF MY COLLEGUES AT STAMFORD JOPARVEZI WHO ESSENTIALLY WENT INTO HUMAN BEINGS WHO NEEDED BRAIN SURGERY FOR OTHER REASONS AND STIMULATED PARTICULAR BRAIN AREAS WITH A VERY HIGH DEGREE OF PRECISION THE TITLE OF THE PAPER THEM REFERRING TO WAS PUBLISHIN TWENTY THIRTEEN IN THE JOURNAL NURON SELL PRESS JOURNAL EXCELLENT JOURNAL AND ITS ENTITLE THE WILL TO PERSEVERE INDUCED BY ELECTRICAL STIMULATION OF THE HUMAN SINGULAT GYRIS NOW YOU NOTIE THE TITLE SAID HUMAN SINGULAT GYRIS NOT INTER MIDSINGULAT GYRIS BUT BECAUSE THEY HAD ELECTRODES AND A STIMULATION TECHNIC THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO STIMULATE IN VERY SMALL REGIONS EXTENDING AS LITTLE AS FIVE MILLIMETERS BUT NO MORE AWAY FROM THE STIMULATION SIHTE THEY WERE ABLE TO MARCH THE STIMULATION AROUND DIFFERENT SUBREGIONS OF THE SINGULAT GYRIS OF HUMANS WHILE THOSE PEOPLE WERE AWAKE AND THEN ASK THOSE PEOPLE HOW DO YOU FEEL WHAT AREYOU EXPERIENCING IN THIS MOMENT IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY WERE RECORTING VARIOUS AUTONOMIC PERAMETERS FROM THOSE PEOPLE SO HART RATE BREATHING IN ADDITION TO BRAINWAV EF ACTIVITY SO WHAT THE SUBJECTS REPORT WHEN THEIR ANTEROR MIDSINGULAT QUARTEX WAS STIMULATED IS THAT IN THEIR WORDS SOMETHING WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN THEY FELT AS IF THERE WAS SOME SORT OF PRESSURE UPON THEM FROM THE OUTSIDE NOT PHYSICAL PRESSURE BUT THAT SOMETHING WAS ABOUT O HAPPEN IN FACT ONE OF THE SUBJECTS DESCRIBE THE SENSATION AS IT'S AS IF THERE'S A STORM OFF IN THE DISTANCE BUT I KNOW I NEED TO GO INTO THE STORM AND I KNOW I CAN MAKE IT THROUGH THE STORM ANOTHER SUBJECT DESCRIBE THE EXPERIENCE OF HAVING THEIR ANTERMID SINGULAT QUARTEC STIMULATED AS OK SOMETHING NOT NECESSARILY GOOD IS GOING TO HAPPEN BUT I KNOW THAT I NEED A MARTIAL RESOURCES AND RESIST AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT I CAN PUSH THROUGH NOW BECAUSE PARVESIAN COLLEAGUES ARE EXCELLENT SCIENTISTS THEY OFE COURSITED CONTROL EXPERIMENTS WHERE THEY WULD TELL THE PERSON O KE WERE STIMULATING THAT SAME BRAIN AREA THAT A MOMENT AGO YOU TOLD ME CREATED THIS FEELING OF SOME PRESSURE UPON YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO RESIST SOME SENSE OF FIGHT OR URGENCY TO PUSH BACK BUT IN REALITY DURING CERTAIN CONTROL CONDITIONS THEY WERE NOT STIMULATING THOSE BRAIN AREAS AND THE SUBJECTS THEN REPORTED I DON'T FEEL LIKE ANYTHING'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN ME I DON'T FEEL ANYTHING AT ALL IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS THE STIMULATION OF THE INTERAMID SINGULAT QUARTEC AND ONLY THE ANTER AMID SINGULAT QUARTEC THAT CREATED THE SENSATION WITHIN PEOPLE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING TO RESIST THAT THRE WAS SOMETHING PUTTING PRESSURE ON THEM IGET NOT PHYSICAL PRESSURE BUT PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSURE AND THAT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE TO MARTIAL RESOURCES IN ORDER TO PUSH BACK UPON IN FACK THEY REPORTED FEELING AS IF THEIR BODY WAS GETTING READY TO DO SOMETHING ONE SUBJECT SAID SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF I FEEL LIKE COME ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING OF ABOUT TO GO SOME PLACE OR DO SOMETHING TO RESIST THIS FOREBODING SENSE THAT'S NOW COMING OVER ME SO THIS IS VERY INTERESTING AND OF COURSES IN LINE WITH ALL OF THE DAT THAT WE DISCUSSED BEFORE ABOUT NERAL ACTIVITY PATTERNS BOTH SPONTANEOUS AND EVOGUED ABOUT BRAIN VOLUME CHANGES IN THE ENTERAMIDSINGULAT QUARTECS SO ON AND SO FORTH AND IT REALLY POINTS TO THE IDEA THAT THE ANTERMIDSINGULAT QUARTEC IS A HUB A HUB THAT RECEIVES INFORMATION FROM A DIVERSITY OF BRAIN AREAS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT A FEW MINUTES AGO AND THAT GENERATES A PARTICULAR SENSE WITHIN US THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE FORWARD CENTER OF MASS THAT WE ARE GOING TO RESIST SOMETHING AND THAT PERHAPS WE ARE GOING TO MOVE OR ACT IN SOME PARTICULAR WAY OR AS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING ALL ALONG RESIST ACTION IN SOME PARTICULAR WAY BUT THAT IT REQUIRES THAT WE MARTIAL RESOURCES WHICH TAKES US BACK OF COURCE TO THE STUDIES OF BAUMISTER AND INDEED OF DWEK WHERE THAT EXPLORED WILL POWER AS A LIMITED RESOURCE PERHAPS GLUCOS PERHAPS AS THAT LIMITED RESOURCE BELIEFS ABOUT WILL POWER AND GLUCOSE PROBABLY WITH THA HIGH DEGREE OF CERTAINTY ARE GOING TO BE INVOLVED THERE TO BUT REGARDLESS OF THAT CONTROVERSY IT'S CLEAR THAT THEREIS AN ENERGY REQUIRED THERE'S AN ACTIVATION STATE OF ENGAGEMENT OR RESISTANCE TO A PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR OR THOUGHT PATTERN THAT WE ALL ASSOCIATE WITH THIS PHENOMENO OF TENACITY AND WILL POWER AND IN A KIND OF MIRACULOUS WAY UNIS THE NOROL SCIENTISTS WERE GENERALLY TAUGHT NOWADAYS THAT INDIVIDUAL BRAIN AREAS DON'T REALLY TRIGGER INDIVIDUAL FUNCTIONS AND PERCEPTIONS OF THE BRAIN THERE ARE FEW EXCEPTIONS TO THAT UNAY OF A FUSE FORM FACE AREA THAT REALLY DOES SEEM TO BE INVOLVED IN THE PERCEPTION OF FACES AND WHEN LESION YOU CAN'T RECOGNIZE FACES BUT OUTSIDE OF JUST A FEW LIMITED CONTET IS VERY RARE THAT ONE COMES ACROSS A LITERATURE THAT CROSS ALL THE STUDIES INVOLVED POINT TO A SINGLE BRAIN STRUCTURE AND ITS NET WORKS AS GIVING RISE TO SOMETHING AS COMPLEX AND FLEXIBLE AS TENACITY IND WILL POWER BUT IN THE CASE OF THE ENTERMID SINGULAT QUARTEX IT REALLY DOES SEEM TO MEET THOSE CRITERIA AS THE BRAINHUB RESPONSIBLE FOR TENACITY AND WILL POWER NOW KEY IDEA THAT DOCTOR FELDMAN BARRETT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO STUDIES OF THE ENTERMIDSINGULAT QUARTEX AS A STRUCTURE THAT HELPS US GENERATE WHAT WE CALL TENACITY IND WILL POWER TO HELP US ACHIEVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF GOALS IS THIS IDEA OF ALOSTASIS MOST OF YIOU PERHAPS HEARD OF HOMEOSTASIS WHICH IS THE IDEA THAT ALL OF OUR SELLS ALL OF OUR ORGANS INDEED OUR ENTIRE BODY AND PSYCHOLOGY ARE ALWAYS SEEKING HOMEOSTASIS THE PERFECT BALANCE OF SLEEP AND ACTIVITY OF FOOD AND BURNING FUELS OF OXYGEN AND CARMODIOXIDE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH AND WHILE HOMEO STASIS CERTAINLY EXISTS AND IS A VALID PHENOMENON THERE'S ALSO A CONCEPT THAT WE HEAR FAR LESS ABOUT BUT THAT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT WHICH IS THE CONCEPT OF ALOSTASIS ALOSTASIS IS THE IDEA THAT MUCH OF WHAT OUR BRAIN AND BODY NEED TO DO BUT ESPECIALLY OUR BRAIN IS TO ALOCATE RIGHT ALOSTASIS TO ALICATE RESOURCES TO PARTICULAR FUNCTIONS DEPENDING ON OUR MOTIVATIONAL GOALS AND THE CHALENGES UPON US AND IN EVERY WAY WHAT WE UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE INTERMIDINGULAT QUARTEX IS THAT IT IS DOING JUST THAT IT IS DECIDING HOW MUCH GLUCOSTS SHOULD A GIVEN BRAIN AREA CONSUME PERHAPS A BRAIN AREA THAT'S INVOLVED IN VISUAL PERCEPTION BECAUSE YOU'RE INVOLVED IN A MOTIVATIONAL TASK WHERE IN ORDER TO SUCCEED YOU NEED TO PAY CAREFUL VISUAL ATTENTION TO PARTICULAR THINGS OR YOU'RE INVOLVED IN A TASK WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO PARTICULAR THINGS OR PERHAPS YOU ARE INVOLVED IN A PHYSICAL FOOT RACE WHERE YOU DON'T WANT TO ALICATE A LOT OF ENERGY TOWARDS THINKING ABOUT YOUR STRIDE OR YOUR STEP UNLESS THAT'S NECESSARY AND YOU ACTUALLY WANT A SHUT DOWN YOUR BRAIN ACTIVITY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE EXCEPT FOR THE BRAIN AIRS THATE REQUIRED TO GET YOU TO CONTINUE ORUN IN THAT SENSE THE INTERMIDSINGULAT QUARTEX AS A SORT OF A DIAL ON HOW MUCH FUEL IS CONSUMED NOT BY THE BRAIN AND BODY AS A WHOLE BUT BY INDIVIDUAL BRAIN AND BODY PARTS MEENS ALL THE CRITERIA OF WHAT YOU WOULD WANT FOR A BRAIN AREA THAT CONTROLS THINGS LIKE TENACITY IN WILL POWER BECAUSE EVEN FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO SEEM TO JUST HAVE AN ENDLESS SUPPLY OF TENACITY IN WILL POWER THEY TOO HAVE TO GO INTO HABITUAL BEHAVIOR THEY CAN'T SIMPLY LEAN INTO EVERY ASPECT OF LIFE WITH THE KIND OF RESISTANCE FROM OUTSIDE AND THE RESISTANCE AGAINST THOSE OUTSIDE FORCES OR EVEN RESISTANCE TO INTERNAL FORCES VOICES IN THEIR HEAD ET CETERA ON A CONSTANT BASIS THEY STILL NEED A SLEEP THEY STILL NEED TO BE FUNCTIONAL IN THAT EXPRESSION OF TENACIAN WILL POWER THEY NEED BE ABLE A STRATEGY SWITCH AND THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO COME OFF THE GAS AS WE SAY NOT BECAUSE TENACIAN WILL POWER ARE NECESSARILY A LIMITED RESOURCE BUT BECAUSE FOR SO MANY ASPECTS OF LIFE ENGAGING TENAITY N WILL POWER IS NOT ADVANTAGEOUS HENCE THE EXAMPLE I GAVE EARLIER ABOUT EATING DISORDERS WHERE AND APPARENTLY HARD WIRED FUNCTION OF OUR BRAIN TO BE ABLE TO GENERATE SOME SORT OREREWARD FOR RESISTING A GIVEN BEHAVIOR GOES TOO FAR AND THEN CAN ACTUALLY THREATEN ONE'S OWN HEALTH OR EVEN LIFE SO THAT CONCEPT OF ALESTATIC LOAD ALESTATIC BALANCE AND ALESTATIC FUNCTION OS SOMETHING THAT WE GET INTO IN A FAIR AMOUNT OF DETAIL IN THE DISCUSSION WHEN DOCTOR FELDMAN BAR IT IN THAT EPISODE JUST COMING OUT SOON BUT IN THE MEANTIME IF YOU ARE TO THINK ABOUT THE INTERAMID SINGULAT QUARTEX AS HAVING A SINGLE FUNCTION THE FUNCTION THE DOCTOR FELDMAN BERRT HAS ASCRIBED TO IT AS CONTROLLING HOW MUCH ENERGY DIFFERENT BRAIN AND BODY AREA SHOULD GET IN A GIVEN CONTEX WILL THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME AND I THINK IT'S THE ONE THAT BEST ASCRIBES ALL OF THE FUNCTIONAL DATA INDEED INCLUDES OR GIBES WITH ALL THE AN ATOMICAL DATA ABOUT THE ANTERMIDSINGULAT QUARTEX AS WELL ONE OF THE REALLY IMPORTANT TWISTS IN ALL THIS IS THAT THE ANTERMIDSINGULAT QUARTEX IS NOT JUST SITTING THERE TO ALICATE AND DOLE OUT DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF ENERGY AND ACTIVATION TO DIFFERENT BRAIN AREAS IT IS ALSO RECEIVING IMPUT FROM BOTH THE BRAIN AND BODY AND IN SORT OF A BEAUTIFUL TWIST ON THE WHOLE STORY OF WHAT THE ANTERMIDSINGULAT QUARTEXS DOES WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE MOVE OUR BODY WE ARE ACTIVATING THE ANTERIOR MID SINGULAT QUARTEX AND WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE MOVE OUR BODY BECAUSE WE IN SOME WAY FORCED OURSELVES OR ENCOURAGED OURSELVES TO DO IT WE ACTIVATE THE ANTERMID SINGULAT QUARTEX MORE SIMILARLY AND BE CAUSE THE ENTERAMIDSINGULA QUARTEX IS SO FLEXIBLE IN THE DIFFERENT CONTEXT IN WHICH IT CAN BE ACTIVATED IF WE ARE SIMPLY READING OR WE ARE LISTENING TO SOMETHING THAT WERE SPPOSE TO LEARN OR TRYING TO LEARN A PIECE OF MUSIC OR TRYING TO DO ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER THE INTER AMID SINGULA QUARTEXTS YES WILL BE ACTIVATED BUT THAT IT'S LEVELS OF ACTIVATION ARE FAR GREATER WHEN WE EXPERIENCE A LOT OF RESISTANCE THAT WE HAVE TO OVERCOME REMEMBER THE EARLIER RESULT AND BY THE WAY I'LL PROVIDE A LINK IN THE SHOWNO CAPTIONS TO THIS PARTICULAR STUDY OR SET OF STUDIES THERE ABOUT TO ONE REALLY SPECTACULAR ONE AND A COUPLE OF OTHERS THAT UM TANGENTIALLY POINTS THE SAME FINDING THAT WHEN PEOPLE ENGAGE IN A HARD TASK NOT AN EASY TAS BUT A HARD TASK THAT THE INTER AMID SINGULAT QUARTEXS ACTIVITY IS ELEVATED SO THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THE INTERMID SINGULAT QUARTEXS IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST SITTING THERE IS A HUB THAT YOU TO REACH INTO AND ACTIVATE IT'S ALSO RECEIVING INPUTS THAT CAN ACTIVATE IT AND THAT'S WHAT ALLOWS US TO NOW TALK ABOUT THE TOOLS AND PROTOCALS THE DON'T JUS ALLOW US TO ENGAGE OUR ANTERY AMID SINGULAT QUARTEX AN AXUS MORE TENACITY IN WILL POWER BUT THAT ALLOW US TO EXERCISE NOT IN NECESSARILY THE CONTECTS OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE  THAT COULD BE THAT TO BUT TO EXERCISE ARE INTERMID SINGULAT QUARTESEES ABILITY TO ENGAGE NOCIOUS IN THAT CHALLENGING CONTEXT BUT IN OTHER CHALLEGING CONTEXTS AS WELL IN FACT ILL JUST TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT STUDIES IN NON HUMAN PRIMATES AND TO LIMITED EXTENT IN HUMANS BUT HERE WE THINK THERE'S A STRONG ANALOGUE BETWEEN THE NONHUMAN PRIMATE DATA AND THE HUMANDATA THE NTERMID SINGULAT QUARTEXS IS CHALKA BLOCK FULL OF THE EXPRESSION OF MOLECULES SUCH AS CAMCINESES TOO RECEPTORS TO VARYOUS NER TROPHINS PARTICULAR TYPES OF N M D A AND METHEL THE ASPORTATE RECEPTORS ALL OF WHICH IF NONE OF THOSE NAMES MEAN ANYTHING TOOU JUST KNOW THAT ALL OF THEM REFER TO DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF AND A CAPACITY FOR SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY WHICH IS THE AB ILITY FOR CONNECTIONS IN THE BRAIN TO CHANGE THEY CAN GET STRONGER YOU NIW SHOULD GROW NEW CONNECTIONS IN OTHER WORDS THE ANTERYMIDSINGULATE QUARTEX CAN BE BUILT UP AS A STRUCTURE TO ENGAGE TENACITY IN WILL POWER BY ACTIVATING IT THROUGH ONE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF BEHAVIORS MEANING ENGAGEMENT IN BEHAVIORS THAT FRANKLY WE WOULD RATHER NOT ENGAGING AS WELL AS NOT ENGAGING IN BEHAVIORS THAT REFLECTSIVELY WE REALLY WANT TO THAT WERE SO DRAWN TO ENGAGING BOTH OF THOSE CONTECTS THE I ABSOLUTELY WILL EVEN THOUGH FRANKLY I DON'T WANT TO OR YOUR TELLING MHE I CAN'T AS WELL AS THE I ABSOLUTELY WON'T EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE TEMPTING ME TO DO THAT OR THAT'S TEMPTING ME TO DO THAT OR EVEN I'M TEMPTED TO DO THAT THAT BUILD UP OF THE ANTEREMID SINGULAT QUARTEX HAS EXTENSIVE CARRY OVER INTO OTHER DOMAINS OF LIFE BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME STRUCTURE THAT IS THEN USED FOR OTHER TYPES OF BEHAVIORS AND LEARNING THAT REQUIRE TENACITY AN WILL POWER SO THAT'S INCREDIBLY REASSURING IN FACT IT'S DOWNRIGHT EXCITING BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WHILE THERE ARE A NEAR INFINITE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE EACH IN ALL NEED TENACITY IN WILL POWER IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S A VERY GENERIC MECHANISM FOR GENERATING TENACITY IN WILL POWER AND THAT MEANS THAT IF WE CAN BUILD UP OUR CAPACITY FOR TENACITY AN WILL POWER BY ENGAGING PARTICULAR TYPES OF BEHAVIORS AND RESISTING PARTICULAR TYPES OF BEHAVIORS WILL THEN IT'S GOING TO CARRY OVER IN A VERY FUNCTIONAL WAY TO THE OTHER ASPECTS OF LIFE THAT WE FIND CHALLENGING AND THAT WE MAY FIND CHALLENGING IN THE FUTURE O CASO BY NOW I LIKE TO THINK THAT I'VE CONVINCED YOU BECAUSE FRANKLY THE DATA ARE VERY CONVINCING THAT THE ANTER AMID SINGULAT QUARTEX IS A VITAL HUB WITHIN YOUR BRAIN FOR ALLOCATING ENERGY AND RESOURCES TO GENERATING TENACITY IN WILL POWER AND PERHAPS IT'S TAKIN YOU A LOT OF TENACITY AN WILL POWER TO GET THIS FAR THROUGH THE EPISODE WAITING WITH BATED BREATH PRESUMABLY TO LEARN HOW EXACTLY YOU CAN IMPROVE THE FUNCTIONING OF YOUR ANTER MID SINGULAR QUARTEX NOW FORTUNATELY THERE ARE PUBLISHED PURREVIEWD DATA THAT EXPLAIN HOW TO DO THAT FACT THERE'S A STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHD IN TWO THOUSAND SIX BY COLUM AND COLLEAGUES ENTITLED AROBIC EXERCISE TRAINING INCREASES BRAIN VOLUME IN AGING HUMANS AND BEFORE YOU GO RUN OFF LITERALLY AND ENGAGE IN CARTY OFASCULAR EXERCISE JUST GOING TO DESCRIBE TO YOU THE CONTOUR OF THIS STUDY AND WHAT SPECIFICALLY WAS DONE SO THAT YOU CAN BEST IMPLEMENT THE BEST PROTOCALS FOR YOUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES THIS WAS A STUDY EXPLORING WHY AND HOW CERTAIN BRAIN AREAS AND BRAIN VOLUME GENERALLY DECREASES AS WE AGE IT'S WELL KNOWN AS I MENTION EARLIER THAT INDIVIDUALS AGED REALLY FIFTY AND OLDER AND HESEARLY AS THIRTY AND OLDER EXPERIENCE A DECREASE IN BRAIN VOLUME WITH PARTICULAR BRAIN AREAS SHRINKING FASTER THAN OTHERS BUT OF COURSE THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE THAT INCLUDE THE SUPER AGERS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER AND MANY MANY OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT SUPRAGERS WHO DON'T EXPERIENCE THE SAME DECREASE IN BRAIN VOLUME SO WHY IS IT THAT THEY MAINTAIN THE SAME BRAIN SIZE THAT THEY DID WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGER OR UNDERGO LESS DECREASE IN BRAIN SISE THAT'S WHAT THE RESEARCHERS FOR THE STUDY WERE INITIALLY INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING AND THEY DID COME TO SOME REALY INTERESTING CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THAT BUT THEY ALSO CAME TO SOME INTERESTING CONCLUSIONS THAT RELATE TO TO DAY'S DISCUSSION ON TENACITY AND WILL POWER THIS STUDY INVOLVED HAVING INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE SIXTY TO SEVENTY NINE YEARS OLD DIVIDED INTO ONE OF TWO GROUPS ONE GROUP DID CARTYVASCULAR EXERCISE THE OTHER GROUP DID MORE CALESTHENICS SLASH STRETCHING TYPE EXERCISE BOTH GROUPS DID ONE HOUR OF EXERCISE THREE TIMES PER WEEK THE GROUP THAT DID CARTY OFASCULAR TRAINING INITIALLY STARTED OFF BY DOING AND BY THE WAY THEY JUST SIMPLY CALLED IT EROBIC TRAINING BUT THIS COULD BE ROWING ON THE ROWER THIS COULD BE RUNNING THIS COULD BE CYCLING I THINK FORSAKE OF UNDERSTANDING APPLICATION OF TOOLS IN PROTOCALS YOU WOULD WANT TO PICK ANY KIND OF ACTIVITY THAT YOU COULD DO CONSISTENTLY WITHOUT INT URING YOURSELF THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT GETS YOUR HEART RATE ELEVATED THEY STARTED OFF THESE INDIVIDUALS WITH RELATIVELY LOW INTENSITY CARDIVASCULAR EXERCISE FOR THAT HOUR GETTING THEIR HART RATE UP TO ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT OF THEIR MAXIMUM HEARTRATE BUT VERY QUICKLY HAD THOSE INDIVIDUALS INCREASE THE INTENSITY OF THOSE CARDIVASCULAR TRAINING SESSIONS SO THEY WERE DOING AGAIN THREE ONE HOUR SESSIONS PER WEEK GETTING THEIR HEART RATE UP TO ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THEIR MAXIMUM HEARTRATES IMS LITTLE LESS SIXTY PER CENT SOMETIMES ALABIT MORE BUT IN THAT GENERAL RANGE SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT THINK ABOUT DIFFERENT ZONES OF CARDIO THIS IS PROBABLY IN THE AREA OF ZONE THREE NOT QUITE ZONE TWO CARDIO IF ZON THREE CARDIO TO WHERE ONE CAN NOT CARRY OUT A CONVERSATION VERY EASILY BUT WHERE ONE IS NOT COMPLETELY GASPING FOR AIR AS ONE WOULD IF THEY WENT TO THEIR MAXIMUM HEART RATE OR NEAR MAXIMUM HEARTRAHT OGAYSO THREE ONE HOUR EPISODES OF CARDIVASAR TRAINING PER WEEK AT A MODERATELY HIGH INTENSITY THE OTHER GROUP SIMPLY DOING CALISTHENICS AND STRETCHING FOR THE EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF TIME AND THEY HAD ANOTHER GROUP WITHIN THE STUDY THAT WERE MUCH YOUNGER THAT DID SIMILAR ACTIVITIES OR NO ACTIVITY SIMPLY AS A CONTROL FOR THE BRAIN IMAGING DATA NOW I'M SUMARIZING THE STUDY WITH A FAIRLY BROAD BRUSH BOTH FOR SAKE OF TIME AND OF COURSE I'LL PROVIDE A LINK TO STUDY IN THE SHOW NO CAPTIONS YOU CAN ACCESS IT AND PROVES IN MORE DETAIL IF YOU LIKE BUT I WOULN'T BE TALKING ABOUT THE STUDY IF IT WERE SIMPLY A STUDY ABOUT CARDIVASCULAR TRAINING AND BRAIN VOLUME TALKING ABOUT THE STUDY BECAUSE THE SPECIFIC BRAIN AREAS THAT MAINTAINED OR IN SOME CASES INCREASED IN VOLUME AS A CONSEQUENCE OF DOING THESE THREE HOURS PER WEEK OF MODERATE INTENSY CARDEVASCULAR TRAINING INCLUDED OF COURSE THE ANTER MIDSINGULA QUARTEX THAT WAS ACTUALLY THE PRIMARY LOCATION IN WHICH THE MAINTENANCE OF BRAIN VOLUME WAS OBSERVED AND IN SOME CASES INCREASES IN BRAIN VOLUME WERE OBSERVED RIGT THIS IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO NORMALLY WOULD BE LOSING VOLUME SIZE OF THEIR ANTER MID SINGULAR QUARTEX BUT FOR WHICH THREE HOURS A WEEK OF MODERATE INTENSY CART OFASCULAR TRAINING MAINTAINED THE VOLUME THE SIZE OF THAT INTER AMID SINGULAR UARTEX AND IN SOME CASES INCREASED THE VOLUME THE SIZE OF ANTER AMID SINGULAR QUARTE AND THEY ALSO OBSERVED A MAINTENANCE OR INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE ANTER WHITE MATTER TRACS REMEMBER T R A C T SIDIDN'T SPELL THAT OUT BE QUARTUS TO SPELL IT OUT FOR FUN ALTHOUGH THAT IS THE SORT OF THING THAT I WOULD PROBABLY DO THOSE WHITE MATTER TRACKS ARE THE COMMUNICATION ROUTS BY WHICH DIFFERENT BRAIN AIR IS COMMUNICATE AND THIS ANTERIOR WHITE MATTER TRACKT THAT MAINTAINED SIZE IN THE PEOPLE THAT DID CARTIVASCULAR TRAINING AS COMPARED TO THOSE THAT SIMPLY DID THE CALICENICS TRAINING AND STRETCHING IS THE VERY WHITE MATER TRACKS THAT CONNECTS THE TWO SIDES OF THE BRAIN THE FRONTO LOBES THAT ALLOWS THE NTERMID SINGULAT QUARTEX ON ONE SIDE THE BRAIN IN THE ANTER MIDSINGULAR QUARTEX ON THE OTHER SIDE OFTHE RAIN AS WELL AS OTHER BRAINSTRUCTURES TO COMMUNICATE WIT ONE ANOTHER SO THIS IS REALLY SPECTACCULAR M IN THE AUTHORS OF THE STUDY DIDN'T EMBARK ON THE STUDY TO FIND OR EVEN LOOK FOR INCREASES OR MAINTENANCE IN THE VOLUME OF THE ANTER AMID SINULAR QUARTEX AND THE COMMUNICATION ROUTS IN AND OUT OF THE NTER MIDSINGULAR QUARTEX IT JUST SO HAPPENED THAT CARTIVASCULAR TRAINING DONE THREE TIMES PER WEEK FOR AN HOUR ATO TIME AT MODERN INTENSY INCREASED THE SIZE OF THE ANTERAMID SINGULA QUARTE AND AS I MENTIONED THE WHITE MATTER TRACKS WHICH ALLOW INFORMATION TO GO IN AND OUT OF THE ANTER AMID SINGULA QUARTEX NOW WE SHOULD ALL BE ASKING OURSELVES WHY WOULD THAT BE THE CASE I MEAN SOMEBODY GETS ON A STATIONARY BY CONPEDALS OR GOES OUT ON A ROAD BYK OR RUNS RS THERE SOMETHING IN HERENT TO RUNNING OR CYCLING OR ROWING OR SWIMMING OR IN A ROVIC'S CLASS DANCING ET CETERA THAT GETS THE HEART RATE UP THAT DIRECTLY FEEDS IN TO THE INTERMIDSINGULAT QUARTEX AFTER ALL IS THE ANTERMIDSINGULAT QUARTE RESPONSIBLE FOR GENERATING THE ACTIVITY OF RUNNING OR CYCLING OR SWIMMIN NO RATHER THE INTERPRETATION IS THAT IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN THIS ONE HOUR THREE TIMES PER WEEK SET OF SESSIONS OF CARTY OFASCULAR TRAINING THEY HAD TO ALLICATE RESOURCES THEY HAD TO GET UP OUT OF A CHAIR THEY HAD TO GET OFF THE COUCH THEY HAD TO SAY NO TO OTHER POTENTIAL OBLIGATIONS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENTS MEALS ET CETERA AND GET TO THESE EXERCISE CLASSES OR SESSIONS THAT THEY DID WITH OTHERS ARE ALONE NOW AN INTERESTING AND IN FACT IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE STUDY IS THAT THE COMPLIANCE WITH THIS THREE HOURS PER WEEK OF CARDY OVASCULAR TRAINING WAS VERY HIGH EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED IN THESE SESSIONS ACROSS THE SIX MONTH PERIOD OF THE STUDY I SHOULD HAVE MENTION THAT EARLIER THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT OVER THE COURSE OF SIX MONTHS THEY DID NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO NUR IMAGING AFTER SAY A WEEK OR TWO WEEKS SO THEY IMAGE THESE PEOPLE'S BRAINS BEFORE AND THEY IMAGE THESE PEOPLE'S BRAIN AFTER THE SIX MONTH PERIOD IT'S ANYBODY'S GUESS AS TO WHETHEROR NOT THEY WOULD HAVE OBSERVED THE SAME OR MAY BE EVEN GREATER INCREASES AT THE ONE MONTH INTERVAL ET CETERA WE SIMPLY DON'T KNOW IS A GREAT COST BOTH ENERGETIC AND FINANCIAL TO DOING THESE KINDS OF STUDIES SO THEY LOOKED AT IT SIX MONTH PERIOD BUT SETTING ALL THAT ASIDE THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT STUDY IN THE CONTEXTS OF TO DAYS DISCUSSION BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT IF WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE INTERMID SINGULAT QUARTEX AND THE VOLUME OF T INTERMID SINGULAT QUARTEC IS RELATED TO ONE'S ABILITY TO GENERATE TENACITY IN WILL POWER FOR ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ENDEAVORS WELL THEN HAVING ACCESS TO A TOOL OR A PROTOCAL THAT CAN INCREASE THE SIZE OF ONES INTERMID SINGULAR QUARTEXT IS GOING TO BE EXTREMELY VALUABLE SO WHAT'S THE TAKE AWAY FROM THE STUDY THE TAKE AWAY FROM THE STUDY IS NOT NECESSARILY THAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING THREE ONE HOUR BOUTS OF CARTY OVASCULAR TRAINING PER WEEK FOR SIX MONTHS TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE THE SIZE OF YOUR INTER MIDSINGULAT QUARTEC I DO THINK THAT'S THE CASE IF YOU'RE NOT ALREADY DOING SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OF CARTY OVASCULAR TRAINING AND WHAT CONSTITUTES SUFFICIENT AMOUNTHS WELL THING IS GENERAL AGREEMENT NOW BOTH BETWEEN THE MATERIAL THAT I'VE COVERED IN OUR FOUNDATIONAL IS PROTOCAL AND IN THE SERIES ON EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY WITH DOCTOR AND GALOPING AND IN VARIOUS DISCUSSIONS WITH DOCTOR PETER ATTEA THE GENERAL AGREEMENT IS THAT EVERYONE SHOULD BE GETTING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED MINUTES OF SO CALLED ZONE TO LOW INTENSITY CARDEVASCULAR EXERCISE PER WEEK BUT THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY REALLY POINTS THE IDEA THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE DOING PERHAPS THREE HOURS BUT CERTAINLY WE SHOULD ALL BE DOING SOME FORM OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE BUT FOR ANY OF US THAT ARE INTERESTED IN INCREASING TENACITY AND WILL POWER A CROSS DOMAINS BOTH FOR COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL ENDEAVORS EMOTIONAL ENDEAVORS TOO FOR THAT MATTER THAT WE SHOULD BE ENGAGING IN SOME EXERCISE AND AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT COGNITIVE EXERCISE IN A MOMENT BUT THT WE SHOULD BE ENGAGING IN SOME EXERCISE THAT WE ARE NOT ALREADY DOING NOW THAT OF COURSE WILL LEAD MANY PEOPLEWO THINK WEIGHT A HONRADINGTO HUNDRED MINUTES PER WEEK OF ZON TO CARDIO HOW CAN I ADD THREE HOURS MORE OF CARDIO THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION ABOUT TENACITY IND WILL POWER IS THAT THE ABILITY TO ENGAGE THE INTERMIDSINGULATE QUARTEX AND TO BUILD UP ITS VOLUME LITERALLY AND INCREASE ITS ACTIVITY RELIES ON ONE CRITICAL FEATURE WHICH IS THAT YOU HAVE TOD BE IN SOME DEGREE OF RESISTANCE SOME LACK OF DESIRE OR I SHOULD SAY LACK OF REFLECTIVE DESIRE OR ABILITYE TO ENGAGE IN THAT BEHAVIOR THIS IS SUPERIMPORTANT IF YOUR THING ABOUT TOOLS AND PROTOCALS TO INCREASE YOUR LEVEL OF TENACIN WILL POWER IF FOR INSTANCE YOU LOVE COLD SHOWERS AND ICE BATHS WELL THEN IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT TAKING COLD SHOWERS OR GETTING INTO AN ICE BATH IS GOING TO INCREASE YOUR LEVEL OF TENACITY AN WILL POWER FURTHER IT MIGHT REINFORCE THE TENACIAN WILL POWER THAT YOU'VE ALREADY BUILT BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO ENCREASE IT FURTHER YOU NEED TO ADD SOMETHING OR SUBTRACT SOMETHING THAT MAKES IT HARDER NOT EASIER TO ENGAGE IN OR RESIST A BEHAVIOR YET ONE O BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT THIS IN THE STUDY TAT AVE JUST DESCRIBED FROM COLUM AN COLLEAGUES THAT TOOK INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE NOT EXERCISING PRIOR TO THE STUDY AND THOSE PEOPL L HAD TO THEREFORE GENERATE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MOTIVATION IN ORDER TO REGULARLY ENGAGE IN THESE THREE ONE HOUR PER WEEK EPISODES OF CARTEVASCULAR TRAINING YED NOW THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO COMPARABLE INCREASE IN THE VOLUME OF THE INTER MID SINGULAT QUARTECS OR INTER WHITE MATTER TRACKS IN THE GROUP THAT DID THE CALISTHENICS AND STRETCHING IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IMPLIES THAT ACTIVITIES THAT ARE EASIER TO CARRY OUT THAT DON'T GET THE HEART RATE ELEVATED AS MUCH ARE NOT GOING TO CREATE CHANGES IN THIS BRAIN STRUCTURE THAT IS ASSOCIATE WITH TENACITY AND WILL POWER AND THERE 'S A NICE CONFIRMATION OF THAT IN THE STUDY IN FACT BECAUSE THEY OBSERVED AS ONE WOULD EXPECT A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN VIO TO MACKS IN THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE ASSIGNED TO THE GROUP THE DECARD EVASCULAR TRAINING BUT THEY DID NOT OBSERVE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN VIO TO MACS IN THE INDIVIDUALS THAT DID THREE ONE HOUR PER WEEK SESSIONS OF CALESTHENICS AND STRETCHING ACROSS THE SIX MONTH PERIOD CASE SO THE IMPORTANT POINT HERE IS IF YOU'RE ALREADY DOING LET'S SAY AN HOUR A WEEK OF MODERATE TO HIGH INTENSITY CARD VASCULAR TRAINING OR RESISTANCE TRAINING FOR THAT MATTER YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO ADD SOMETHING IN ORDER TO GET FURTHER ACTIVATION OF THIS BRAIN HUB FOR TENACITY IN WILL POWER AND OF COURSE THE IDEA HERE OR ELSE WE WOULN'T BE TALKING ABOUT IT IS THAT THAT ACTIVATION OF THAT INCREASE IN VOLUME IN THE INTERAMIDSINGULAT QUARTECS WITHIN BE APPLICABLE TO OTHER ENDEAVORS FOR INSTANCE ACADEMICS OR SOME ASPECT OF YOUR PROFESSIONAL LIFE FOR RELATIONSHIP LIFE THAT YOU CAN BUILD UP TENACIAN WILL POWER AS A CAPACITY WITHIN YOU OR WE SHOULD SAY WITHIN YOUR ANTER MIDSINGULAT CORTESEES BUT THAT THE ROUTE TO ACTIVATING AND INCREASING THE ROBUSTNESS OF YOUR INTER AMID SINGULAT QUARTECS REQUIRES THAT YOU ENGAGE IN SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO DO IN CERTAINLY NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE REGULARLY ENGAGING IN ALREADY REMEMBER WAY BECK TO THE BEGINNING OF TO DAY'S EPISODE WE COMPARED WILL POWER AN TENACITY TO HABIT EXECUTION WELL THIS IS A SIMPLE CASE WHERE IF YOU ALREADY DOING G SOMETHING SIMPLY CONTINUING TO DO IT MIGHT MAINTAIN WHAT YOU'VE ALREADY GOT BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO FURTHER BUILD UP YOUR TENACITY IN WILL POWER SO ALONG THOSE LINES I DON'T WANT YOU TO SIMPLY TAKE THE THREE ONE HOUR CARDIVASCULAR SESSIONS PER WEEK PROTOCAL THAT THEY USE WITHIN THIS STUDY AND EXPECT IT TO INCREASE YOUR LEVELS OF TENASCIUN WILL POWER UNLESS OF COURSE YOUR CURRENTLY ONLY DOING ONE HOUR OF CARTEVACULAR TRAINING AT MODERATE TO HIGH INTENSITY PER WEEK IN WHICH CASE INCREASING TO TWO HOURS MAY VERY WELL INCREASE YOUR INTER MID SINGULARE QUARTEX AN OVER ALL LEVEL TENACITY IN WILL POWER AND CERTAINLY DOING THREE HOURS PER WEEK WOULD BE EXPECTED TO DO IT EVEN FURTHER AND I SHOULD MENTION THAT WE CAN EXTRAPLATE FROM THIS STUDY IN A MEANINGFUL WAY I THINK IN A GROUNDED WAY THAT'S RELATED TO MECHANISM AND SAY WELL IF YOU FOR INSTANCE LIKE ME CAN'T PLAY A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT OR ARE NOT BY LINGUELL IN LANGUAGE THAT TAKING ON THE CHALLENGE IF INDEED IT'S A CHALLENGE AND FOR ME IT WOULD BE A CHALLENGE PERHAPS FOR YOU AS WELL TO LEARN AN INSTRUMENT AS AN ADULT OR TO LEARN A SECOND OR MAY BE A THIRD LANGUAGE IF THAT'S CHALLENGING AND IN FACT THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE RESISTING DOING WILL THEN GREAT IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE AN EVEN GREATER OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE THE ACTIVITY OF THE ANTURE MID SINGULARE QUARTEX REMEMBER THAT STUDY THAT SHOWED THAT HARD TASK HARD CHALLENGES AR WHAT ACTIVATE THE INTERMID SINGULARE QUARTEX'S EASY CHALLENGES DON'T A HABITS THAT ARE REFLECIVE SIMPLLY DO NOT SO YOU HAVE TO PICK SOMETHING HARD YOAVE TO PICK SOMETHING THAT'S EITHER PHYSICALLY AND OR PSYCHOLOGICALLY HARDON OF COURSE WE WANT O HIGHLIKE THE FACT YOU NEVER WANT TO ENGAGE IN ANYTHING PHYSICAL OR COGNIVE EMOTIONAL OR OTHERWISE THAT IS PSYCHOLOGICALLY ORE PHYSICALLY DAMAGING TO YOU RIGHT BECAUSEIS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO MAINTAIN OR CARRY OUT FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME NOW ALONG THOSE LINES WE COULD IMAGIN A HUGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROTOCALS THAT ONE COULD ENGAGE IN BUT I THINK THERE'REA COUPLE OF KEY THINGS THAT EXTEND ACROSS ALL F THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FIRST OF ALL IT'S CLEAR NOW BASED ON OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ANATOMICAL IM PUTS TO THE ENTER AMID SINGULAR QUARTEKS THAT WHILE EXERCISE S GREAT AND CERTAINLY MOVEMENT TOF THE BODY WHEN WE DON'T WANT TO MOVE OUR BODY H A RUNNING AK A WEIGHT LIFTING AK A LEARNING A NE SKILL LIKE DANCING OR GYMNASTICS OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT IS GOING TO ENGAGE THIS HUB FOR TENACITY AND WILL POWER THE INTER AMID SINGULAR QUARTEKS BUT THERE ARE UMBER OF OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT AND WE CAN THINK OF THOSE IN A KIND OF PLAYFUL CONTECT BUT ONE THER'S BOTH PLAYFUL AND HIGHLY FUNCTIONAL AND APPLICABLE SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU ALREADY RESISTANCE TRAIN AND YOU'RE DOING WHAT WE NOW GENERALLY GREE IS A FIELD IS THE MINIMUM OF SIX HARD WORKING SETS PER MUSCLE GROUP PER WEEK IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OR BUILD MUSCLE SIZE AND STRENGTH SOME OF YOU DON'T WANT TO BILD MUSCLE SIZE BUT EVERY ONE SHOULD BE TRYING TO MAINTAIN MUSLE STRENGTHERE'S A VERY HIGH CORRELATION WE NOW KNOW BETWEEN MUSCLE STRENGTH AND COGNIVE FUNCTION SPECIALY AS ONE GETS PAST FORTY YEARS OF AGE BUT EVEN YOUNGER SO MAINTAINING NOUR MUSCULAR FUNCTION AND STRENGTH IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT EVEN IF YOU DON'T WANT T INCREASE MUSCLE SIZE YOU CAN LEARN HOW TO DO THAT BY THE WAY WE ZERCOSPROTOCALS HERE ALL LISTED OUT BY GOINGTO HUBORAND LABDOCK CALM CHECK OUT THE SERIES I DID WITH DOCTOR ANY GALPIN CHICK OUP THE KEY TOOL KIT TAKE AWAYS FROM THAT SERIES ALSO AVAILABLE HUBOR AND LABDOCK COM JUST PUT EXERCISE PROTOCALS INTO THE SEARCH FUNCTION BUT LET' SAY YOU'RE ALREADY RESISTANCE TRAINING YOU'RE ALREADY DOING CARDVASCULAR TRAINING WHAT CAN YOU DO TO BUILD UP YOUR TENACITY AN WILL POWER FOR APPLICATION IN NOT JUST THAT ENDEAVOR BUT OTHER ENDEAVORS WELL PICK SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THESE ARE WHAT I CALL IN A VERY NON SCIENTIFIC WAY MICRO SUCKS THESE THING SUCK BUT THEY SUCK A LITTLE BIT AND THEY'RE SAFE RIGHT YEFTO PICK THINGS THAT ARE SAFE FOR YOU BUT THEY SUCK ENOUGH THAT THEY REQUIRE SOME EFFORT THEY REQUIRE GETTING OVER SOME FRICTION ENGAGING IN SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T REFLECTIVELY WANT TO DO SO FOR INSINCE THAT MIGHT BE ONE EXTRA SET AT THE END OF A ROUND OF THREE TO FIVE SETS OF A GIVEN EXERCISE ORE IT COULD BE FOR INSTANCE A HUNDRED JUMPING JACKS AT THE END OF WHAT YOU CONSIDER A HARD RUN IT COULD BE FOR INSTANCE FINISHING OUT THAT LANGUAGE LESSON AND THEN DECIDING TO DO FIVE MINUTES OF SITTING STILL THINKING ABOUT THE MATERIAL THAT YOU LEARN WHEN YOU'E SO DESPERATELY WANTED JUS JUMP ON YOUR PHONE RIGHT PICK CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE DEGREE OF RESISTANCE IS VERY HIGH WHERE THE DEGREE OF IMPULSE TO DO SOMETHING ELSE THEN THE THING THAT YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO DO IS VERY HIGH AND THEN START APPLYING THOSE ON A REGULAR BASIS IT COULD BE AFTER EVERY WORK OUT IT CULD BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORK OUT FOR INSTANCE SOME PEOPLE HAVE A REALLY HARD TIME NOT LOOKING AT THEIR PHONE DURING A WORK OUT I LIKE TO LISTEN TO PODCATS OR MUSIC DURING TO WORK OUT BUT I REALLY TRY AND RESIST TEC MUSSAGING AND READING EMALE AND THINGS THAT SORT WHILE WORKING OUT SO THE HARDER THAT BECOMES THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT AND THE MORE I RESIST IT THE MORE PRESUMABLY ACTIVATION OF THE INTERMID SINGULATE QUARTEKS I'M GETTING AND THAT YOU WOULD GET AS WELL SO THESE LITTLE MICRO SOCKS LIKE HAT SOCKS NOTS THE LOOK AT THE PHONERA NOW IT SUCKS TO DO A HUNDRED JUMPING JACKS AT THE ENDER A RUN OF COURSE IF YOUR XCITE DU TO THE HUNDRED JUMPING JACKS AT THE END OF THE RUN THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE A GOOD AVENUE INTO ACTIV ATING AND INCREASING THE VOLUME OF YOUR INTERMID SINGULATE QUARTEKS EVERYTHING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT UP UNTIL NOW SUPPORTS THE STATEMENT I JUST MADE EASY TASKS DESIRABLE TASKS DON'T DO IT IT'S THE THING YOU DON'T WANT TO DO SO IMPARTING THSE OLE MICRO SOCKS CAN BE VERY USEFUL YOU'LL HAVE TO THING ABOUT WHAT PARTICULAR MICROSOCKS YOU INCORPORATE INTO YOUR EXERCISE ROUTINES YOUR COGNIVE ROUTINES IN YOUR DAILY ROUTINES AND HOW OFTEN I DON'THINK YOU NEED TO GO COMPLETELY BAZARK ON THIS DOING THEM ALL DAY LONG BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT THESE ARE THE SORTS OF BEHAVIORS AND RESISTANCE OF BEHAVIORS BECAUSE AGAIN CERTAIN MICROSOCKS MIGHT BE YOUKNOW IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY PRACTISES INTERMITIN FASTING YOUKNOW WE DO'T WANT SEND YOU INTO THE REALM OF EATING DISORDER BUT YOU MAYBE REALLY DO WAIT AN EXTRA FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE YOUR USUAL FIRST MEAL TIME WHICH FOR ME WOULD REALLY SOCK THAT MIGHT EVEN MOVE FROM MICROSOCK INTO MACROSOCK CAUSE I LIKE TO EAT WHEN I'M HUNGRY BUT WAITING A FEW EXTRA MINUTES FOR NO OTHER REASON THEN ALLOWING ONESELF TO ACTIVATE THAT INTERIOR MIDSINGULA QUARTEX CIRCUITRY WOULD BE ONE WAY TO TRY AND BUILD UP ONE'S TENASCITY AN WIL POWER SO IT' SOME LEVEL THIS SHOULD ALL SEEM PRETTY LOGICAL IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T EVEN REQUIRE A FIRM UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERLYING NARROW SCIENCE FOR IT TO MAKE SENSE RIGHT YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING YOU RESIST DOING IT THAT'S BUILDING UP TENASCEAN WILL POWER YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO DO SOMETHING YOU DO IT THAT'S BUILDING UP TENASCEAN WILL POWER WELL I DO BELIEVE IN FACT THE'RE 'S A LOT OF DATA TO SUPPORT THE FACT THAT OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS UNDERNEATH THINGS LIKE TENASCITYAN WILL POWER CAN BE VERY ADVANTAGEOUS WHEN TRYING TO CARRY OUT THESE DIFFERENTYPES OF BEHAVIORS TO INCREASE TENASCIAN WILL POWER WHY WELL TODAY WE LEARN THAT THERE'S A HUGE VARIETY OF CONTEXTS IN WHICH ONE CAN ACTIVATE THE INTERAMIDSINGULAT QUARTEXS WHICH MEANS THAT IT'S NOT CARTY OFASCULAR EXERCISE PER SEY IT'S NOT RESISTING THE COOKY PER SE IT'S NOT WAITING FIFTEEN MORE MINUTES TO EAT OR MAKING SURE THAT YOU SIT STILL AND DON'T LOOK AT YOUR PHONE AT THE END OF A LEARNING BOUT AND REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU LEARN TO MIT MORE NOW IT REALLY REALLY SUCKS TO DO THAT T'S REALLY HARD CREAT'S A LOT OF AGITATION IT'S NOT ABOUT ANY ONE OF THOSE PROTOCALS IF YOU WILL PER SEY RATHER IT'S ABOUT DELIBERATE ENGAGEMENT IN THE BEHAVIORS THAT WE LEAST WANT TO DO IN A GIVEN MOMENT OR IF YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD UP WILL POWER AND TENASCITY TO NOT ENGAGE INT OR CERTAIN TYPES OF BEHAVIORS IT'S ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO SUPPRESS BEHAVIORAL ACTION NOW I DO ANT A HIGH LIGHT THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS OF THIS TYPE OF REPROACH TO BUILDING UP TENASCEIAN WILL POWER AND INDEED TO LIFE AND WE CAN CALL ON THE EARLIER EXAMPLE OF EATING DISORDERS AS A VERY SALIENT ONE RIGHT THERE IS A WAY IN WHICH ALL OF THIS CAN RUN AMUCK AND WE CAN GET SO HEAVILY INTO STOICISM WE CAN GET SO HEAVILY INTO THE IDEA OF BUILDING UP TENASCEIAN WILL POWER THAT IT TAKES US INTO REALMS THAT ARE UNHEALTHY FOR US PSYCHOLOGICALLY EMOTIONALLY AND DOR PHYSICALLY AND THAT CERTAINLY NOT THE GOAL HERE AND I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO MOTIVATE THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR OR RESISTANCE OF BEHAVIOR WE SHOULD ALL BE SEEKING A RELATIONSHIP WITH LIFE AND WITH GOALS ET CETERA THAT INVOLVES YES I BELIEVE SOME DEGREE OF ACTIVATING TENACITY IN WILL POWER REALLY FINDING THAT FIGHT WITHIN US THAT PARVISIAN COLLEAGUES FOUND WHEN THEY STIMULATED THE NTER AMID SINGULATE QUARTEXS OF PEOPLE RIGHT OF A SUDDENELIC YET DRIVING INTO A STORM OR THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT TO HAPPEN I'M GOING TO HAVE TO RESIST O'M EITHER CAN HAVE TO DO SOMETHING OF RESIST DOING SOMETHING BUT THEI'RE SOMETHING ACTIVE IT INSIDE ME I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE ALL ABLE TO GARNER THOSE RESOURCES AND TO ACTIVATE THOSE STATES WITHIN US VOLUNTARILY BUT I ALSO KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE IN FROM OBSERVING OTHERS AND INDEED FROM THE LITERATURE ON THE ENTER AMID SINGULATE QUARTEX AS IT RELATES TO EATING DISORDERS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF NEUROLOGIC AND PSYCHEATRIC CHALLENGES IS THAT WE ALSO NEED TO LEARN HOW TO TURN THAT OFF WITH THAT SAID THE LITTLE MICROSUCKS THAT WE DISCUSSED YOU KOW THE ADDITION OF A HUNDRED JUMPING JACKS AT THE END OF A CARTY OF ASCULAR TRAYING SESSION WHEN YOU WOULD MUCH RATHER JUST SHOWER UP AND GO HOME GETTING INTO THE COALD SHOWER OR COALD PLUNGE WHEN YOU ABSOLUTELY DON'T WANT TO DO IT WELL PROVIDED YOU CAN DO IT SAFELY THAT'S GOING TO BE THE BEST TIME TO DO IT IF YOUR GOAL IS TO BUILD UP TENACTIAN WILL POWER TO SAY NOTHING ELSE OF THE KNOWN BENEFITS OF THINGS LIKE DELIBERATE COALD EXPOSURE AND EXERCISE LIKE JUMPING JACKS ET CETERA THEY'RE ALSO ENTIRE LANDSCAPES OF LIFE AND ACADEMICS AND SPORT THAT AFFORD US THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD UP TENACI IN WILL POWER I FOR INSTANCE CAN RECALL TAKING MY SOCAL QUALIFYING EXAMS AN GRADUATE SCHOOL WHERE THEY ASK YOU QUESTIONS UNTIL YOU SAY I DON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER IT'S JUST LIKE THAT PUZZLE IN THE BALMISTER STUDY THEY'RE TAKING YOU THE POINT WHERE YOU BASICALLY CAN'T WIN AND THAT TURNS OUT TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT LESSON THAT EXTENDS BEYOND THE INFORMATION THAT THEY'RE ASKING YOU ABOUT OF COURSE EVERY STUDENT AT THE END OFTHEIR QUALIFYINGSAND RUNS OFTEN FIGURES OUT THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION THAT THEY COULDN'T GET THE RIGHT ANSWER TO SOMETIMES THERE IS A RIGHT ANS ER SOMETIMES THE'RE NOT IF THE COMMITTEE IS PRETTY DIABOLICAL THEYGH GIVE YOU AN IMPOSSIBLE TO ANSWER QUESTION TO THERE'S NO ANSWER BUT THE POINT BEING THAT WHETHER NOTS IN MARSHAL ARTS WHETHER NOTS AND SPORTS WHETHER NOTS IN MUSIC WETHER NOTS IN ACADEMICS WHETHER NOTS IN RELATING TO OTHERS THERE IS SOME VALUE TO GETTING TO THAT POINT WHERE YOU CAN'T SOLVE THE PUZZLE AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE RUST T UNDERSTAND AND MAY BE TO INCORPORATE INTO OUR TOOLS AND PROTOCALS THAT THERE ARE SOME ENDEAVORS THAT HAVE NO END POINT RIGHT THERE'S NO WINNING THERE'S NO FINISHED LINE AND THOSE TYPE OF ENDEAVORS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR CONTINUALLY BUILDING UP OUR TENACITY AND WILL POWER SO MUCH SO THAT WE CAN EVEN TAKE A SOMEWHAT THREE THOUSAND MILE VIEW FROM THE TOP DOWN ON TO EVERYTHING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TO DAY AND THINK ABOUT THOSE SUPER AGERS THOSE SUPER AGERS THAT SOMEHOW ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE COGNIVE FUNCTION OF A MUCH YOUNGER PERSON AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATE ON SUPER AGERS AND PEOPLE SIMILAR TO THEM YOU'LL FIND ARE ALWAYS ENGAGED IN SOME ACTIVITY THAT'S HARD FOR THEM THEY'RE AWAYS TRYING TO LEARN SOMETHINGAND THEY HVE A SORT OF PLAYFULNESS ABOUT IT BUT THEY SEEK OUT THOSE FRICTION POINTS BOTH RESISTANCE OF CERTAIN BEHAVIORS RIGHT TRYING TO NOT DO CERTAIN THINGS BUT PERHAPS MORE OFTEN DOING CERTAIN THINGS LEARNING A NEW SKILL LEARNING POTTERY LEARNING MUSIC PLACING THEMSELVES INTO NOVEL ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE OR A LOT UNCOMFORTABLE PROVIDED THAT IT'S SAFE SO FROM THAT STANDPOINT ONE COULD EVEN ENTERTAIN THE IDEA THAT BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE LIVING MUCH LONGER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE IN ADDITION TO MAINTAINING THE COGNIVE FUNCTION OF MUCH YOUNGER INDIVIDUALS THAT PERHAPS THE INTERMID SINGULAE QUARTEX IN ITS ABILITY TO ALLICATE RESOURCES TO DIFFERIN PARTS OF OURBPBRAIN AND BODY TO MEET CERTAIN MOTIVATIONAL GOALS IS ACTUALLY ASSOCIATE WITH THIS THING THAT WE CALL THE WILL TO LIVE NOW THE CONCEPT OF THE WILL TO LIVE IS CERTAINLY GETTING ALIMIT SQUISHY FOR A SCIENTISTS LIKE ME WHO YES I'M HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN DISCUSSIONS THAT RELATE TO PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSTRUCTS SUCH AS TENACITY AND WILL POWER BUT AS YOU PROBABLY NOTICED I'M VERY COMFORTABLE WITH AND VERE EXCITED ABOUT THE IDEA THAT OK MAYBE ITS RELATE SOMEHOW TO BRAIN ENERGETICS AND GLUCOS MAY BE NOT CERTAINLY I'M ON BOARD THE IDEA THAT BELIEFS IMPACT OUR PHYSIOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY IM PACKS OUR BELIEFS ALLA DOCTOR ALLYCRUM WHO IS A GUEST ON THE PODCAST PREVIOUSLY TALKED ABOUT BELIEF AND MIND SET EFFECTS WHICH ARE VERY POWERFUL THEY CHANGE OUR PHYSIOLOGY LITERALLY AND THE DIECT DATA THAT WE TALKED ABOUT TO DAY BUT OF COURSE ALSO THAT THEY ARE BRAIN AREAS AND CIRCUITS THAT UNDERLIE THESE THINGS THAT WE CALL TENACITY AND WILL POWER SO WHEN WE GET INTO A DISCUSSION ABOUT TENASCIAND WILL POWER AND THEN FIND OURSELVES AS WE ARE NOW TIKG ABOUT THE WILL TO LIVE I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TOO FAR TO SAY THAT WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THE DATA ON LONGEVITY BOTH PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL LONGEVITY IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THERE UNDERLYING PHYSIOLOGICAL EXPLANATIONS NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS LIKELY TO BE THE MAINTENANCE IF NOT GROWTH OVER THE LIFE SPAN OF THIS ANTER AMID SINGULARE QUARTEX BUT ALSO THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACHIEVING THAT ARE CONTINUALLY FORGING IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT THEYRE CONTINUALLY LOOKING FOR NEW ENVIRONMENTS THEY'RE CONTINUALLY EXPLORING THEY ARE NOT BECOMING COMPLASANT THEY ARE NOT BECOMING SET INTERY THEY ARE NOT EXISTING DOWN AT THAT END OF THE CONTINUUM THAT WE CALL APATHY AND DEPRESSION BUT THAT THEY'RE NOT EXISTING DOWN THERE AND THEY ARE EXISTING UP TOWARD THE END OF THE CONTINUUM THAT WE CALL TENACITY AND WILL POWER AN ENGAGING MOTIVATION TO GET THERE CAME MOTIVATION AGAIN AS A VERB BUT IN DOING THAT THAT THEY'RE REENFORCING THE VERY CIRCUITS THAT GIVE RISE TO TENACITY IN WILL POWER THIS IS WHAT IN ENGINEERING TERMS IS REFERRED TO AS A CLOSED LOOP PSYCHE DU A WHICH LEADS TO BE WHICH LEADS TO S WHICH FEEDS BACK ON TO A AND MAKES A THAT MUCH MORE LIKELY TO OCCURRETS LIKE TURNING THE LITTLE A INTO A CAPITAL A AND THE TURNING INTO A BOLD FACED CAPITAL UNDERLINE A IN THE UILD UP OF NARL CIRCUITS SO WHILE TO DAY WE FOCUSS A LOT ON AN INDIVIDUAL BRAINAIR INTER AMIDSINGULATE QUARTEX AND IN MANY WAYS I'V PRESENTED IT AS IF IT'S THE BE ALL END ALL OF TENACY IN WILL POWER IT IS NOT TO BE ALL END LL OF TENACI N WILL POWER IT'S OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE THE INTER AMID SINGULATE QUARTEX THAT ALLOWS US TO EXPRESS TENACITY IN WILL POWER BUT IN THIS CLOSELUTE FASHION IT'S OUR ABILITY TO EXPRESS TENASSIAN WILL POWER THAT THEN FEEDS BACK ON TO THAT CIRCUIT AND MAKES IT MORE ROBUST AND MORE LIKELY TO BE ACCESSIBLE IN THE FUTURE WHEN WE ENCOUNTER SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO OR THAT WE HAVE TO RESIST VERY STRONGLY IN ORDER TO NOT ENGAGE IN SOME SORT OF BEHAVIOR OR THOUT POWDER SO THE BIG TAKE AWAY IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO INCREASE YOUR TENACITY IN WILL POWER YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN YOU CAN DO THAT BY TRIGGERING ACTIVATION OF THIS INCREDIBLE HUB WITHIN THE BRAIN THE ENTER AMIDSINGULATE QUARTEX FOR WHICH THERE IS NOW A VERY LARGE AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE IS AT LEAST CENTRAL TO THE WHOLE PROCESS OF GENERING TENACIY AN WILL POWER THE I ABSOLUTELY WILL DO THAT AND THE NO I ABSOLY WON'T DO THAT IT'S THE RESISTANCE HUB IT'S THE THING THAT'S ALLICATING RESOURCES TO DO THE THING THAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO OR THAT SOME ONE'S TRYING TO PREVENT US FROM DOING IT'S ALSO THE BRAIN AREA THAT'S ALLOWING US TO RESIST DOING THE THING THAT WE WANT O DOER THAT SOMEONE ELSE WANTSIS TO DO WHEN WE DECIDE THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR US WE CAN REALLY BE CERTAIN BASED ON THE PSYCHOLOGY LITERATURE BASED ON THE NARROW SCIENCE LITERATURE AND REALLY BASED ON THIS BEAUTIFUL LITERATURE THAT'S NOW EMERGING THAT INCLUDES THE COLUM STUDY BUT SOME OTHER STUDIES AS WELL THAT PERHAPS WILL TALK ABOUT IN A FUTURE EPISODE THAT WE REALLY CAN BUILD UP OUR CAPACITY FOR TENACITY AND WILL POWER IT'S A REAL THING AND AS A FINAL POINT TO THIS AND INDEED AS A FINAL PROTOCAL WA'S VERY EXCITED TO LOOK INTO THE EARLY RELEASE OF PUREVIEWED PAPERS OUT FROM NURON JUST THIS LAST WEEK AND TO SEE THAT THERE WAS A STUDY I'LL BE IT IN A PRECLINICAL MODEL IN AN ANIMAL MODEL THAT EXPLORED WHAT IS CALLED STRESS RELIEF AS A NATURAL RAZILIENCE MECHANISM AND I WON'T GO INTO THE STUDY IN FULL DETAIL ESPECIALLY NOT NOW LAID INTO A SLIGHTLY LONG EPISODE SUCH AS THIS ONE BUT WHAT THE STUDY SHOWED IS THAT WHEN AN ANIMAL IS IN A STATE OF DESPAIR OR AHIDONIA LACK OF PLEASURE WHEN IT'S UNDER STRESS AND THEN THAT STRESS IS REMOVED THERE'S A SENSE OF REWARD THERE'S A SENSE OF WELL BEING THAT ACCOMPANIES THAT RELEASE OF STRESS AND THAT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT SOMETHINGTHA WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT FOR A VERY LONG TIME BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THE STUDY AND THAT SHE TALK ABOUT THIS IN TERMS OF ITS APPLICABILITY POTENTIALLY TO HUMANS IS THAT WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO WITHSTAND A STRESS MAYBE THAT STRESSES SCHOOL MAYBE THAT STRESSES OF PARTICULAR RELATIONSHIP AGAIN YOU NEVER WANT TO DO THESE THINGS IN A WAY THAT'S UNHEALTHY OR DANGEROUS BUT WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT THE RELIEF THAT WE FEEL AFTERWARDS IS ITS OWN FORM OF REWARD THAT SERVES TO REENFORCE THAT WHOLE PROCESS OF TENACITY AND WILL POWER THAT GOT US THROUGH THE STRESSER AND AN INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS STUDY IS THAT THEY WENT ON TO COMPOUND THAT REWARD THEY SHOWED THAT REWARDING ONE'S SELF FOR HAVING GOTTEN THROUGH A STRESSFUL EPISODE ACTUALLY SERVES TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY TO GET THROUGH STRESSFUL EPISODES IN THE FUTURE IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU DECIDE TO DEVELOP CERTAIN TOOLS AND PROTOCALS TO INCREASE YOUR LEVELS OF TENASCITY AND WILL POWER WHICH FRANKLY I HOPE THAT YOU W'LL AT LEAST CONSIDER GAN PROVIDE YOU DO IT SAFELY THIS SEEMS LIKE A VERY GOOD THING TO DO FOR ALL OF US ESPECIALLY AS WE AGE AND GUESS WHAT WE'RE ALL AGENT FROM THE TIME WERE BORN IF YOU DECIDE TO DO THAT PICK SOMETHING THAT'S CHALLENGING OVERCOME THAT CHALLENGE AGAIN THIS COULD BE THE REQUIREMENT TO ENGAGE IN A PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO OR TO RESIST A PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR THAT YOU WOULD OTHERWISE WANT TO ENGAGE IN BUT ALSO WHEN YOU'VE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THAT RESISTANCE WHEN YOU'VE ENGAGE THAT TENASCI IN WILL POWER AN YOU'VE ACTIVATED THAT ANTER AMID SINGULAT QUARTEX WELL THEN OCCASIONALLY NOT ALWAYS UT OCCASIONALLY PROVIDING YOURSELF WITH A REWARD OF SOMETHING THAT YOU LIKE AND HERE IT'S HIGHLY SUBJECTIVEYU'LL JUST HAVE TO PIK SOMETHING THAT YOU LIKE AGAIN SOMETHING THAT'S OFULY HEALTH PROMOTING NOT HEALTH DIMINISHING CAN SERVE TO FURTHER REINFORCE THE BEHAVIOR THAT YOU JUST ENGAGED IN WHICH WAS TO INCREASE YOUR TENACITY AND WILL POWER AND IF YOU LISTEN TO THE EPISODES THAT I'VE DONE ON DOPAMINE MOTIVATION AND DRIVE OR ON DOPAMINE MORE GENERALLY YOU WILL KNOW THAT I AM NOT A FAN OF REWARDING ONESELF FOR WINDS OR FOR ENGAGING TENASCIAR WILL POWER FOR THAT MATTER ON A REGULAR BASIS ARE CERTAINLY EVERY TIME THIS IS THE SORT OF THING THAT JUST RANDOMLY EVERY ONCES IN A WHILE WHEN YOU'VE DONE THE HARD THING OR VIOU RESISTED THE THING THAT WAS PULLING ON YOU THAT YOU SHOULD REWARD YOURSELF BUT OF COURSE REWARD YOUR SELF IN HEALTHY AND SAFE WAYS FOR THOSE OF YOU THEY ARE INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT HOW TO REWARD THE ACTIONS OF TENASCIAN WILL POWER I'LL PROVIDE A LINK TO THE RECENTLY PUBLISHED PAPER IN URON IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS IW'LL ALSO BE DOING A TOOLKID EPISODE THAT RELATES TO WHAT WE COVER TO DAY AS WELL AS SOME ADDITIONAL TOOLS GLEAN FROM OTHER PAPERS AND RESOURCES IN THE NOT TO DISTERNT FUTURE THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME FOR TODAY'S DISCUSSION ALL ABOUT TENACITY AND WILL POWER WE TALKED ABOUT THE IDEA GLEANED FROM RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY THAT TENASSIAN WILL POWER ARE LIMITED RESOURCES AND THAT PERHAPS AGAIN PERHAPS THEY RELTE TO THIS CONCEPT OF EGO DEPLETION THAT RELATES TO THIS IDEA THAT WHAT IS DEPLETED OR WHAT'S LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE TENASCIN WILL POWER SOMEHOW RELATES TO BRAIN ENERGETICS AND FUEL CONSUMPTION NAMELY GLUECOS I ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE CONFLICTING DATA THAT ARGUES THAT IF WE BELIEVE TENASSIAN WILL POWER LIMITED AND THAT GLUCOSS IS THE THING THAT LIMITS THEM WELL THEN THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS SO I TALKED ABOUT THAT CONTROVERSY AND SOME OF THE DTA THAT ACTUALLY RECONCILE A BIT OF THE DIFFERENCES THERE SO IN THE ABSENCE OF NEW DATA YOU'LL HAVE TO DECIDE FOR YOURSELF WHAT YOU BELIEVE ABOUT TENACITY AN WI LL POWER HOWEVER IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE UNIVERSAL TRUTH WHICH IS THAT OUR TENACITY IN WILL POWER RIDES ON THE TIDE OF AUTONOMIC FUNCTION THAT IS WHEN WE ARE SLEEP DEPRIVED WHEN WE ARE IN PAIN WHEN WE ARE IN EMOTIONAL PAIN OR WHEN WE ARE DISTRACTED OUR TENACITY IN WILL POWER IS DIMINISHED WHICH CALLS UPON ALL OF US TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE TAKING CARE OF OUR AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS THROUGH VIEWING MORNING SUNLIGHT GETTING SUFFICIENT SLEEVE ADEQUATE NUTRICION SOCIAL CONNECTION THINGS THAT HAVE COVERED EXTENSIVELY ON PREVIOUS EPISODES THEN WE TALKED ABOUT THE NURL UNDER PINNINGS OF TENACITY IN WILL POWER AND THIS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE BRAIN STRUCTURE THAT WILL ALL A HUB BECAUSE IT'S NOT OPERATING IN ISOLATION BUT RATHER IT'S GETTING IN PUTS FROM LOTS OF DIFFERENT BRAIN AREAS RELATE TO REWARD EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AUTONOMIC FUNCTION MOTOR PLANING GOAL SEEKING ET CETERA THAT WE CALL THE NTER AMID SINGULAT QUARTEX THIS PHENOMINALLY INTERESTING BRAIN AREA THAT SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO GENERATE THIS THING THAT WE CALL TENACITY IN WILL POWER AND THAT WHEN WE ENGAGE OR EXPRESS TENACI N WILL POWER BY DOING THE THING THAT WE LEAST WANT TO DO BY NOT DOING THE THING THAT WE MOST WANT TO DO IN A GIVEN MOMENT THAT WE ACTUALLY CAN BUILD UP OUR INTER MID SNGULAT QUARTEX AND THEREBY BUILD UP OUR FUTURE CAPACITY TO ENGAGE THE INTER MID SINGULAT QUARTEX WHEN WE NEED TO CALL ON TENACITY AND WILL POWER AND THEN WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE PUREVIEW DATA THAT SHOWS HOW THAT ACTUALLY CAN BE DONE WHERE THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY EXERCISING DID A CHALLENGING THREE ONE HOUR SESSIONS PER WEEK OF CARDIVASCO TRAINING AND INDEED THEIR INTERMIDSINGULAT QUARTE AND THE CONNECTIONS TOO AND AWAY FROM IT INCREASED IN A WAY THAT SET THEM APART FROM THEIR AGE RELATED COHORPSE THAT IS THEIR BRAINS STAYED YOUNGER MAY BEVEN GOT YOUNGER WHEREAS THOSE THAT DID NOT DO THE HARD THING IGHT THAT DIDN'T ENGAGE TENACIAN WILL POWER DID NOT EXPERIENCE THE SAME EFFECT AND THEN WE TALKD ABOUT HOW THOSE DATA COULD BE EXTENDED INTO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REALMS SUCH AS COGNIVE LEARNING LEARNING LANGUAGES LEARNING MATH LEARNING ART LEARNING ANY NUMBER OF DE FREN THINGS OR IN THE PHYSICAL REALM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN TIMES OF EXERCISE THAT ONE IS NOT ALREADY ENGAGING IT ADDING IN A LITTLE BIT OF ADDITIONAL EXERCISE SPECIFICALLY AT A TIME IN WHICH YOU LEAST WANT TO DO THAT OR EXTENDING YOUR FATING PERIOD IF THAT'S SOMETHING HAT YOU'RE DOING AND THATYOU CAN DO HELPFULLY SIMPLY BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOU TO EXERCISE YOUR INTERMID SINGULAT QUARTEX ACH A TENACITY AND WILL POWER AND OF COURSE WE HIGHLIGHTED THAT ALL THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THE CONTEXS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL SAFETY WE DON'T WANT ANY ONE TO DO THINGS THA ARE GOINGTO BE PHYSICALLY DAMAGING TO THEMSELVES BUT IF ONE SIMPLY TAKES THE STANCE OF OKE WHAT'S SOMETHING I CAN DO IN A MOMENT THAT WILL ALLOW ME TO BUILD UP TENACITY AND WILL POWER WELL IT'S GOING TO BE THE THING THAT I LEAST WANT TO DO IN THAT MOMENT OR THE THING THAT I LEAST WANT TO RESIST DOING IN THAT MOMENT TO PERIODICALLY ADD IN THOSE LITTLE WHAT I REFER TO AS MICROSOCS A VERY UM NON SCIENTIFIC FRANKLY NON PSYCHOLOGICAL TERM BUT I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS LITTLE THINGS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO BUT THAT IF WE DO THEM YOU CAN BE SURE THAT YOU ARE ACTIVATING THE ENTERAMID SINGULAT QUARTEX AND THEREBY INCREASING THE PROBABILITY THE LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU CAN ACCES TENACIAN WILL POWER MORE READILY IN THE FUTURE SO IT HAVE DONE TO DAY IS EXPLAIN THE SCIENTIFIC STUDIES IN THE REALM OF PSYCHOLOGY AND NOURO SCIENCE THAT EXPLAIN WHAT TENACITY AND WILL POWER OR AND WHAT ALLOWS US TO BUILD UP OUR TENACITY WILL POWER OVERTIME AND THEN IT'S REALLY UP TO ALL OF US TO YOU AND TO ME AND EVERYBODY ELSE TO FIGURE OUT IN WHICH PARTICULAR DOMAINS AND WITH WHICH FREQUENCY WE'RE GOING TO DECIDE TO BUILD UP OUR TENACIAND WILL POWER SO I'S CLEAR THAT TENACITY AND WILL POWER ARE NOT JUST RESOURCES THAT WE NEED TO CALL UPON FROM TIME TO TIME IN ORDER TO OVERCOME THINGS BUT THAT INDEED CALLING ON OUR ABILITY AND BUILDING UP OUR ABILITY FOR TENACI N WILL POWER CAN ALLOW US A MUCH RICHER ENJOYMENT OF LIFE AND PERHAPS CAN EVEN EXTEND OUR LIFE BY ENGAGING THE WILL TO LIVE THANK YOU OR JOIN ME FOR TOS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF TENACITY AND WILL POWER AND TOOLS AND PROTOC ALLS TO INCREASE ONE'S ABILITY TO ACCESS

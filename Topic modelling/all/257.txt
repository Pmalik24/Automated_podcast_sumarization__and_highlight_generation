THEM TAKIN TO A CAR AND YOU KNOW BY ALL ACCOUNTS SEEMED EXTREMELY PLEASED AND EXPECTED THEM TO BE EQUALLY SO AND AND YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S THE THE MOMENT RIHT AFTER THAT WHEN TIY WENT BACK TO THE VILLA CLOSE ABOUT THEM DOOR TURN THE FALSEITS ON TO TOKE AN ORDER TO LI DIAT PRIVATELY THEY TURND THE FOSSES ON TO THEY CAN WHISPER AND EXTAY OF A PRIVATE CON EXACT AND THEY JUST ASKED ONE ANOTHER WHAT HAD

HOURS GOING THROUGH EVERYTHING CHIN AND CHAY MADE A LONG TURN PLAN IN A SHORT TURN PLAN LONG TURM THEY WERE GOING TO ESCAPE BUT THEY WOULD WAIT TILL THEY COULD DO IT RIGHT SO THEY WOULDN'T BE CAUGHT THEIR SHORT TURN PLAN YINVOLVED A SMALL TAPERQUARTER WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO GET BECAUSE ONE OF THE WEIRD PRIVILEGES OF THEIR CAPTIVITY WAS THAT THEY WERE ALLOWED TO SHOP AT A DEPARTMENT STORE THAT SOLD THINGS THAT WERE OUT OF REACH FOR MOST PEOPLE ON THE COUNTRY LIKE TAPERQUARTERS KIM JOHNGILL HAD LONG AND SHORT TURN PLANS OF HIS OWN FOR THEM HE TOLD THEM THAT SOON HE WOULD SUMMON THEM TO TALK ABOUT HIS VISION FOR THEIR FUTURE THEN SEVEN MONTHS WENT BY AND DURING THOSE MONTHS SCHIN AND CHA SPENT HOURS NEARLY EVERY WEEK AND KIMS HUGE FILM ARCIVE HE WANTED CHIN AND CHAY TO SEE IT AND BE IMPRESSED AND THEY WERE KIM DIDN'T JUST LOVE THEIR MOVIES HE LOVED ALL MOVIES IT WAS AGAINST THE LAW FOR ORDINARY NORTH CAREANS TO WATCH FAREIGN FILMS BUT KIM HAD SET UP A MASS IF BOOT LEGGING OPERATION RUNNING IN COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE WORLD SO HE COULD BUILD UP HIS PRIVATE COLLECTION WITH EVERY MOVIE EVER MADE OR AS CLOSE AS HE COULD GET THE ARCIVE WAS THREE STORIES HIGH AND HEAVILY GUARDED AT LEAST TWO SCREENING ROOMS ALL FOR KIM ONLY AND NOW FOR CHIN AND CHAY CHIM WAS BOWLED OVER BY EVERY DETAIL YOU KNOW THE TO WAY THE BHUILDING ITSELF WAS SET UP TO RUN AND AND YOU KNOWIT ADMIRATION OVER HOW KIM HAD SET UP HIS OWN ARKIVAN AND HOW WELL EVERYTHING WAS KAPT YOU KNOW GEEKING OUT OVER THE AIR CONDITIONING SET THINGS AND HOW HE WAS PRESERVING THE SETELOIDE AND YOU KNOW HOW EVERYTHING WAS CATHALOGUE THAN THE STAFF AND N HOW LARGE IT WAS HOW AS IT CATEGORIZED WAS IT BY YEAR OR BY JONRA OR BY DIRECTOR AND WENT BY COUNTRY FIRST AND THEN I THINK HIT WENT BY YEAR AS THEY GOT THE MAN AND AND THERE'S THAT LOVELY TAUCH WHERE YOU KNOW THA SOUTH GREAN FILMS IN A KIND OF NORMAL AIR CONDITIONING ROOM AND AND THE NORTH GREAN FILMS AN AMUS LAVISH STORGE AN SCREENING ROIMA NL BILL DIN  THE FILMS WERE DUBBED INTO CAREIN AFTER BEING PAINS TAKING I TRANSCRIBE SOMETIMES BY AMERICANS HRE WAS AN AMERICAN DEFECTOR HE WAS ONE OF SEVERAL ACTUALLY WHO'D BEEN THERE SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE AND ONE OF HIS JOBS WAS TRANSCRIBING AMERICAN FILMS BUT JUST BAY LISTENING ECAUSE HE WASN'T ALLOWED TO WATCH THEM YET AND HE WOULDN'T KNOW THAT THEY WERE FILMS BECUSE THEY GAVE HIM ANY OTHER AMERICAN EFFACTORS THE GAUDIO FOR SOME REASON THEY CHOLPED UP THE FILMSHANTRACTS INTO DIFFERENT BITS IN THE LONG ORDERS TA THEY WOULDN'T NO I GET THEY  EN DOING EXACTLY ENJOY THEM BUT HE HAD THIS EXPERIENCE OF OF IN A TRANSCRABING IM AN SUNLY REALIZING WAT THIS IS MY POPINS CHINAN CHA SPENT DOZENS AND DOZENS OF HOURS WATCHING ONE MOVI AFTER ANOTHER IN THE SCREENING ROOMS THAT THE FILM ARCIVE AND IN THEIR VILLA WHICH WAS ALSO OUTFITTED TO SHOW MOVIES THEY DID THAT FOR MONTHS UNTIL FINALLY THEY GOT WORD KIM IS READY TO MEET WITH YOU THEY WENT AND THEY BROUGHT THE CAPERCORTER AND THE SECOND THEY WALKED IN AND CHAY HAD THE TAPEQUARTER AND HER A PERSE AN TRY FLICTED ON AND I THINK UNEXPECTEDLY KIMDRUNGELL JUS TALKED AT THEM MOSTLY FOR TWO HOURS N A KIM RINGAL SPOKE VERY VERY FAST AND HIS MIND SOULT HAVE WENT ALL OVER THE PLACE AND HE HAD A VERY INTIMODATE THING WAY THEIR SLASH BODY GUARD WHO KEPT WALKING AND TE TO REFILL DRANK AND EMPTY ASH TRACE CHIN AND CHAY WANTED TO RECORD KIM FOR TWO REASONS FIRST THEY KNEW THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO ESCAPE MAYBE THEY WOULD BE KILLED AND THEIR CHILDREN AND FRIENDS WOULD JUST NEVER KNOW WHAT HID HAPPENED TO THEM OR ACCORDING IF THEY COULD SMUGGLE IT OUT WOULD AT LEAST BE PROOF OF WHERE THEY'D BEEN THE SECOND REASON TO RECORD HIM WAS THAT THEY KNEW THAT KIM WOULD INSIST THEY SAY PUBLICLY THAT THEY HAD COME TO NORTH CAREE ON THEIR OWN VOLUNTARILY CHIN AND CHAY WERE HOPING THAT IN THEIR PRIVATE CONVERSATION KIM MIGHT ADMIT TO HAVING HAD THEM KIDNAPPED AND BROUGHT TO HIM AND HE ALMOST ALMOST DID BY MAKING A JOKE IN THE FIRST COUPLE OF MINUTES OF THEIR CONVERSATION KIM TALKED ABOUT HOW HE BROUGHT CHAY OVER FIRST IN ORDER TO ENTICE CHIN TO NORTH CAREE I SAYD JOKE BECAUSE KIM LAUGHS AS HE SAYS IT AND THEN ALL THREE OF THEM LACK  IT'S TYRANT MANAGEMENT ONE O ONE HE LAUGHED YOU LAUGHE THE REST OF WHAT KIM SAID IN THAT CONVERSATION WELL HE SAID A LOT OF THINGS BUT THE MAIN THING WAS NORTH CAREE AN MOVIES ARE BAD AND I AM SICK OF IT THEY WOULD MAKING G THE SAME FILM OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND THAT THEY WERE TOO LONG AND TO BORING AND LIKE HISTORY LESSONS AND AND TO MOLHE DRAMATIC AND THAND SAYS THERE'S TOO MUCH CRYING AT IN TELL ANYBODY BUT IN SO MUCH CRYING KIMJHNYEL TOLD CHIN AND CHA THAT HE KNEW HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE COUNTRY WHO COULD GET AWAY WITH SAYING WHAT HE WAS SAYING AND HE TOLD THEM NOT TO REPEAT ANYOF IT HE SAID WHEN IT COMES TO MOVIES WE ARE IN KINDERGARTEN AND OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE SOUTH CAREA ARE IN COLLEGE HE SAID IF WE DON'T CATCH UP IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS OUR MOVIES ARE GOIN TO BE THE WORST OF THE WORST MOVIES IN THE WORLD THE PROBLEM HE SAID JUST BETWEEN US IS THE PEOPLE IN NORTH CAREA HAD IT TOO EASY THEY HAD THINGS HANDED TO THEM HE HAVE TO HOSTLE LIKE SHIN AND CHADED THERE'S A POINT AN T THIY WET HE TELLS THEM THAT I NO AN I THINK INE SAYS I PARFIS THER BAY SAYS HE NAT THERES NO IND SENTIVE AND SOCIALISM TO BUNYUBAT  AY HI  AYS MIGHT MIGHT SCREENWRITERS I AT THEY'LL WRIGHT SOMETHING THEYLL GET THEIR ASSION O HEOTHER GIS MAKE A FILM NOT AT THEIR ASSIONI THEY HA PAID NO MATTER WHAT THEY THAT AGIS TURN OUT THAT THE WORK EXACTLY AN FALLOW ORDERS IM ANY SHEEM VERY CONSCIOUS THAT IN I NEEDS SOME ONE HE HE PUSHES HIMSELF MORE THAN THAT WHO'S USE TO HAVING TO DO MORE THAN THAT THE EARNEST KEEP KIM JOHN YEL NEVER MENTIONED ANOTHER POSSIBLE REASON WHY NORTH CREER'S MOVIES WERE WOODEN AND UNAMBITIOUS LIKE FEAR HE KIM JOHN YILL HAD WRITTEN THE BOOK THE ONLY BOOK IN NORTH CAREE ABOUT THE RIGHT WAY TO MAKE MOVIES AND THINK ABOUT MOVIES IT'S CALLED ON THE ART OF THE SINAMA ITS STILL IN PRINT EVERYONE INVOLVED IN NORTH CREE'S FILM INDUSTRY IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES HAD TO HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF DOING SOMETHING AS UNPATRIOTIC OR INSULTING AS TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT ARTISTIC VISION WITHOUT KIM'S EXPLICIT BLESSING AND HIS FATHERS IT WAS BETTER TO BE CRAPPY THAN SORRY THE CONVERSATION CONTINUED CHIN AND CHA MURMURED THAT NORTH CAREA'S CITIZENS WERE FORTUNATE TO HAVE A COMRADE LEADER WHO UNDERSTOOD FILM SO WELL KIM JOHNYEL AGREED WITH HIS PERMISSION HE THREE OF THEM GOT INTO CROTIKING SPECIFIC FILMS A NORTH CRE IN ONE CALLED THE STARVOE CAREA AND WHILE THEY WERE AT IT A SOVI AT FILM CALLED MOTHER THAT HAD A DYING SCENE THEY ALL AGREED HAD BEEN ATROCIOUS THEY WERE THREE MOVI LOVERS TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY LOVED AND KIM JOHN YEL'S BIG PLAN FOR CHINN AND CHA WAS THAT HE WANTED THEM TO MAKE NORTH CARENE MOVIES GOOD SO THAT THEY COULD COMPETE WITH FILMS COMING OUT OF THE WEST AND WHEN AWARDS AND BE SHOWN IN THEATRS ALL OVER THE WORLD HE WANTED CHA TO ACT TO ME MOVIES AND CHIN TO DIRECT THEM CHIN COULD HAVE HIS OWN FILM COMPANY JUST LIKE HE USED TO HAVE CHIN WANTED TO CALL THE COMPANY SHIN FILM A VERY BOLD REQUEST IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES HE HAN NOTHING IN NORTHWEA HAD BEEN CALLED ANYTHING OTHER THAND E NOT THE WORK IS PARADISE THAY AT A PARTE THIS IT A SUPREMELY A THIS ORNO KIMALSON UNIVERSITY AM SO WAS A BIG GEEL BUT IS ALSO NO VERY TELLING OF SHIN THAT EVEN IN THIS SEVEAL SITUATION HIS FIRST INSTINCT IS A KICAOCA IT CAN W GIVE THE COMPANY MY NAME IN INN IN FILM NOIR SOME ONE IS ALWAYS USING SOMEWHAT AND OFTEN PEOPLE ARE USING EACH OTHER AND WE DON'T FIND OUT TIL THE END WHO GETS AWAY WITH WHAT CHIN AND CHA KNEW THAT THEIR ONLY CHANCE OF ESCAPE WOULD BE TO CONVINCE KIM JOHN ALE TO LET THEM FILM AND WORK IN THE WEST CIM GEN ILL KNEW THAT IF HE WANTED GOOD MOVIES HE HAD TO GIVE SHIN AN CHA ENOUGH FREEDOM TO CREATE THEM SO ALL THREE OF THEM WANTED TO MAKE GREAT MOVIES BUT SAME BED DIFFERENT DREAMS CAM DANGAL ON OF THE FILMS FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES AND ANEED OF THE FILMS TO GET AWAY FROM HIM  AND ITS ALMOST LIKE HIS AMBITION OF MAKING FILM WITH THE WORLD OF RESPECT COMPLETELY OVERTOOK ANY SENSE OF LOGIC SO THE FIRST FILMSION AND CHAY AM SHAW HAD SEQUENCES THAT THEY SHOT AND EAST IN EUROPE STANDING IN FOR THE HAGUE AND IU NOW THE SHOWED CIM DUNG IL TE FILM AM HE SAID THIS IS FANTASTIC IT'S LIKE A EUROPEAN FILM IT'S THE BEST THING WEEVER MADES ALLAD HIM START SHOWING IT AND I NEVER CROSS HIS MIND THAT THEY HAD DONE EXACTLY WHAT HED FORBIDDEN HIS OWN FILM MAKERS TO DO FOR EVER FOR REASON THEY BEEN FORBIDDEN TO SHOW THE WORLD OUTSIDE NORTH CAREA THEY SHOWED PEOPLE THINGS THAT THEY HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE IU N ALMOST IN A LIFETIME FOR SOME PEOPLE IN NORTH CAREA ABOYUT INETEEN EIGHTY THREE NINE INTY FOR AND A SECONDS THAT FILM SIRY PLAYING IN SINIMAS IN NORTH CAREA OU KNOW THE NORTH GREEN AUDIENCES DIDN'T TAKE IN NECESSARILY THE HIRPRODUCTION VALEYS AM ALL THEY COULD TALK ABOUT WAS THAT FIRST TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES SHOT ON THE STREETS OF PRAGE WHERE OU KNW CEY WAIT THE BUILDINGS LOOK AMAZING PEOPLE WALKING INTO BUSINESS AS THEYE  DRESSE DIFFERENTLY WITHAS CARS WET YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT WE HAD AN IMPACT BECAUE UP UNTIL THEN THEY HAD BEEN TOLD YOU ARE THE LUCKIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD OU KNOW THE WORKERS PARADISE IS THE ONLY PLACE IN THE WORLD WITH PEOPLE HAVE PEACE AND FREEDOM AM AND AND SULY THEY SAW THAT THAT WASN'T TRUE HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THUS WOR PEOPLE THOUGHT I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO AN MEETS AND SPEAK TO PEOPLE WHO'D ESCAPE FROM NORTH CAREE WHO WERE IUN A VARINGATEIS AT THE TIME HAT THEY WERE ABLE THEE WASHKEES FILMS AM AND HAS ANOTHER AT GERMAN RECERTUR AND IN JAPANA COL THE HANAS CRANHER WHOS TON QUITE THE LOV OF TALK TO THE FACT AS ABOUT THE SAME THING AND ATS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S FASCINATING IS THAT SHIN AND CHASE FILMS HAD A HUGE IMPACT STRAIGHT AWAY OU THE OIIVEN PEOPLE A NARILATES THIRTIES WHO'D NEVER SEEN ANYTHING OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD THEY HADN'T BEEN FILTERS BUT THET WASN'T JUST THE PEOPLE SUNDLY WERE ABLE TO SEE YOU KNOW FOOTAGE OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD THAT IU NA CHIN AND CHA MADE AM A FILMCOM LOVE LOVE MY LOVE WHICH WAS LITERALLY THE FIRST LOVE

DBRIEFED BY THE S A A AND LATER BY SOUTH CAREE AND ANTELLIGENCE AND THEY WERE INTERVIEWED BY THE WASHTON POST AND OTHER MEDIA OUTLETS AND STORIES ABOUT NORTH CAREA ARE ALWAYS HARD TO FACT CHECK FOR PARTS OF SHIN AND CHASE STORY THEYRE RECOLLECTIONS THEIRE INTERPRETATIONS ARE ALL THERE IS BUT THE MOVIES EXIST THER CORTING OF KIM EXISTS CIM GENIAL HAD TOLD SHIN AND CHA IN THE RECORTING THAT WHEN PEOPLE ASKED THEM WHY THEY WERE IN NORTH CAREE THEY SHOULD SAY FREEDOM FOR TRUE ARTISTIC FREEDOM FOR CHIN THERE WERE SOME BITTER TRUTH TO THAT BECAUSE SOUTH CAREE AT THE TIME SHIN AN CHA WERE KIDNAPED HAD BEEN A MILITARY DICTATORSHIP WITH VERY HEAVY HANDED CENSORS SHIN STUDIO HAD BEEN SHUT DOWN BY D THE SOUTH CAREENE GOVERNMENT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE HIS CAREER WAS IN RUINS IN NORTH CAREA SHIN GOT TO MAKE FILMS AGAIN HE WROTE UNIMBASHEDLY IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY HOW MUCH HE HAD LOVED MAKING MOVIES THERE SHIN ALWAYS SPOKE OF NORTH CAREA AS THE PLACE WHERE HE CAN OF A  THAT  THE PLACE HE

CATEGORY CALLED ALL AROUND SENIOR YOU WERE ALLOWED TO COMPETE IN TWO CATEGORIES BUT NO MORE THAN THAT AND G E C HS REALLY PUT A LOT INTO THESE SUPRLATIVES THERE WAS AN ELECTION LIKE USUAL WITH PAPER BALLATS BUT INSTEAD OF ANNOUNCING THE WINNERS OVER THE INTERCOM WHEN POSTING THEM ON A HALWAY BULLET ON BOARD THERE WAS THIS EVENT RUN BY THE SENIOR LEADERSHIP COUNCIL WHICH MARK WAS ON A BIG CEREMONY AND TROPHIES ALL OF THE WINNERS RECEIVED A LITTLE REPLICA OF THE OSCAR STATUET IT WASN'T UNLIKE  ROST LIKE ALL THE SENIORS WERE IN OUR AUDITORIAM AND I THINK I ACTUALLY NOW THI REALIZER I THINK I A HELP GIVE THEM OUT I BUT I DO REMEMBER YOU KNOW READING NAMES OF SOME OF MY FRIENDS AND CHEERING THEM ON AND ALL OF MY BEST FRIENDS ALL ONE THINGS WHICH MAKE SENSE MARK WAS POPULAR HIS FRIENDS WERE POPULAR BUT THAT WAS THIRTEEN YEARS AGO AND HE HADN'T BEEN THINKING TOO MUCH ABOUT THE SUPRLATIVES UNTIL RECENTLY I WAS AT HOME COOKING DINNER AND I GOT A TEXT FOR MY FRIEND A FRIEND FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND ALL I SAID WAS PLEASE THOUGHPT WER TO DOING AND READ THIS IT WAS A FACEBOOK POST POSTED TO A PRIVATE FACE BOOK GROUP FROR MARKS HIGH SCHOOL CLASS THE CLASS OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN MARKED OT ONFACE BOOK SO WAS THE FIRST HE WAS SEEING IT AND THE TEXT WASN'T JUST A MARK FOUR OTHER BODIES FROM HIGH SCHOOL WERE ON AT HIS WELL WE ALL READ IT AND IMMEDIATELY WE WERE ALL FREAKING OUT AM I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS ON I GOT TO SMICK SO MUCH SENSE AM I WONDER IF YOU COULD JUST READ THAT HOST DO YOU HAVE IT THERE TUTLY AM SO A HE SAID HEGGAS ONE MORE THING BEFORE I FORGET AN THE SPIRIT OF THE NEW YEAR I LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CONFESS TO ALL OF YOU THAT I AND ONE OR TWO OTHER MEMBERS OF SENIOR LEADERSHIP COUNCIL OF SEVEN WHO'LL REMAIN UNNAMED INTERFERED WITH THE CLASS OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN SENOR SUPPOLIVES THIS IS NOT A JOK WE WENT TO GREAT LANDS TO FORGE NO LESS THAN THIRTY FILL ABOUT BALLATS WITH ALL OF OUR FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES WINNING THEIR RESPECTIVE CATEGORES WE ATTEMPTED TO RIG LITERALLY EVERY CATEGORY SO CLASSIC BALLAD STUFFING WITH THIRTY FORGED BALLATS AT LEAST THE PERPETRATOR GOES ON TO SAY THAT NOT EVERY ONE HE TRIED TO FIX THE ELECTION FOR ACTUALLY WINE AND THE NOMINES FOR EACH CATEGORY THE CHOICES ON THE BALLAT THOSE WERE ALLAJET IT'S JUST THE OUTCOME THAT WAS NOW IN QUESTION CATEGORY AGAIN WAS CONFESSION WAS COMING THIRTEEN YEARS AFTER THE FACT WOW I FEEL ICH A WAY LIFTED OFF MY SHOULTERS HAVING FINALLY CONFESS THIS THANK YOU FOR READING OH MY GOD WERE NOW IT'S NOT LIKE MARK HAS BEEN SITTING AROUND FOR THE LAST THIRTEEN YEARS CLINGING TO HIS MANY OSCAR TROPHE THE FINDING HIMSELF BY HIS SUPERLATIVES SINCE HIGH SCHOOL HE'S PORT HIS NO LONGER CLOSETED ENERGY INTO ENTER TAINMENT WORKED FOR ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY FOR A LONG TIME JUST MOVED OVER TO NETHLICS BUT IT'S NOT LIKE HE THINKS HE DIDN'T DESERVE HIS AWARDS WHETHERR NOT HE RIGGED IT'S INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT WHO REALLY WAS RIG BECAUSE LIKE ME I REALLY OBJECTIVELY WAS VERY SCHOOL SPIRITED AND VERY ALL AROUND SENIORY AND A COUPLE OF FRIENDS ON THE TEXT THREAD FELT THE SAME WAY ONE OF THEM SAID DO YOU THINK PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE I HAD BEST EYES WE PARTICULARLY WERE INTERESTED BECAUSE THE FIVE OF US ALL ON WE ALL WONT SOME DIFFERENT SUPPRILATIVES AND WE ALL THOUGHT THI WAS PRETTY CHOOL BECAUSE I THINK ULTIMATELY LIKE HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR SUPPRILATIVES ARE AM MAN IT'S COMPLICATED RIGHT THEY ARE ABSOLY MEANINGLESS AND YET AT THE TIME THEY ARE SUCH A HUGE DEAL BECAUSE THEY ARE YOU KNOW PURE VOTED AND NOBODY WANTS THEIR MEMORIES KIND OF TAMPERED WITH OR INVALIDATED RIGHT LIKE SUBCONSCIOUSLY WE'RE ALL THINKING TO OURSELVES OH MY GO WHAT WOULD EIGHTEEN YOLD ME HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT MEOW YOU KNOW LIKE THAT REALLY AT THE CORE OF ALL THIS WE'RE ALL HAVING IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD SELVES THINKING OH MY GOD HE CAN NEVER NOW I THIS WILL THIS WILL UPROUD HIM THIS WLL UNRAVEL HIM TO FIND OUT YOU KNOW WHICH PROBABLY EXPLAINS WHAT HAPPENED NEXT IN SHORT MAR POSTED IS GREN SHOT OF THE CONFESSION TO TWITTER ON THINKING MUCH ABOUT IT WENT OFF TO THE GIM AND WHEN HE CAME BACK IT HAD EXPLOT MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND LIKES AND REREETS IN COMMENTS AT THIS POINT MOST OF THEM NOT GAGSEA JESALUMS WERDLY A LOT OF PEOPLE WROTE THAT THE SAME THING HAD HAPPENED AT THEIR HIGH SCHOOL OR THAT THEY THEMSELVES HAD RAGE TO SUPPROV ELECTION WERE IT ALWAYS SUSPECTED SUPERELATIVES WERE RAGED AND NOW HERE WAS PROOF AT COUPLE PEOPLE POINTED OUT SOMETHING THAT I NOTICE TOO THAT THE PERPETRATOR NEVER ACTUALLY APOLOGIZES IN HIS MESSAGE I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS GOING TO GO VIRAL I THOUGH THIS WAS GOING TO BE SHARED WITH FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE IND MI HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR CLASS FACE BUT PAGE AND THAT WAS IT THIS IS MICHAEL BARLIVAV RIGGER OF HIGH SCHOL ELECTIONS CONFESSOR OF HIGH SCHOOL TRANSGRESSIONS THIRTY YEARS OLD NOW STILL LIVING IN ALLEY AND I HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED QUESTIONS FOR HIM CHIEF AMONG THEM WHY IT TOOK HIM SO LONG TO COME CLEAN AND WHAT IT HAD BEEN LIKE SITTING WITH THE WEIGHT OF THAT GUILT FOR SO MANY YEARS YOU SAY AT THE END OF THE CONFESSION EM I ON AH I FEEL SUCH A WEIGHT LIFTED OFF MY SHOULDER ALIFF O MISHLLAS YET WHAT WIC IS THAT IS THAT DID YOU NO THAT WAS JUST ME BING A THAT WAS JUST ME BING SYNICAL IN TRUTH THERE WAS NO WAIT NO GILT IN FACT MICHAEL HAD WANTED TO COME CLEAN RIGHT AWAY BUT A BUNCH OF MORE PRESSING THINGS TOOK HIS ATTENTION HE WAS DIGNOZED WITH CANCER ACTUALLY WENT THROUGH TREATMEN GOT BETTER MOVED ON IT WAS ONLY WHEN HE SAW HIS FORMER CLASSMATES TALKING ABOUT A POTENTIAL REUNION ON THE FASE BOOK PAGE THAT HE THOUGHT OF ALL THIS AGAIN AND THE THING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT MICHAEL UNLIKE MARK HE WAS A SLACKER SENIOR YEAR CHECKED OUT ONLY INTERESTED IN HIS WORDS SMOKING WEET AND GETTING LAY AND THEN HE FOUND OUT THERE'S A SUPERLATIVE FOR THAT BIGEST CASE OF SENIORRIT US AND I REMEMBER BEGGING EVERYBODY IN MY HOMEROOM TO NOMINATE ME AND I ASKED ALL MY FRIENDS  I REALLY WANT TO GET SENIOR ITUS LIKE I WANT THIS BECAUSE HE WAS COMPETITIVE ABOUT BEING A SLACKER AND ORGANIZED ABOUT IT HE ONLY PICKED FOUR SUPEREASY CLASSES SENIOR YEAR INCLUDING HE SAYS SENIOR LEADERSHIP COUNCIL WHICH RAN THE ELECTION SO HE KNEW THAT NO ONE WOULD NOTICE IF DURING CLASS HE AND AN A COMPLICE HUNG OUT FOR A WHILE NEAR THE BALLAD BOX WHERE THERE ALSO HAPPENED TO BE A STACK OF BLANK BALLAT'S HANDY AND ONE THING MICHAEL LEARNED RIGHT AWAY RIGGING AN ELECTION CAN BE COMPLICATED THERE WAS ACTUALLY ONE CATEGORY I REMEMBER WHERE TWO GIRLS WERE WE'RE BOTH NOMINATED NOMINATED FOR THE SAME CATEGORY AND WE WERE FRIENDS WITH BOTH OF THEM AND O LIKE WE JUST FILLED OUT AN EQUAL NUMBER OF BALLADS FOR EACH OF THET BECAUSE IT DIDN'T WANT O FAVOR I DIDN'T WANT A FAVOR EITHER ONE CAUSE I LIKE THEM BOTH WAS IT A KIND OF THING WERE LIKE OTHER PEOPLE REALLY WANTED AS CERTAIN SUPERLATIVE OR ERE LIKE YOU KNOW I MEAN LIKE YOU REALLY WANTED BIGGEST CASE OF SENIORITUS EN YOU WERE BEGGING PEOPLE IN YOUR HOME ROOM TO NOMINATE YOU WELL ES LET WAS NT LET'S NOT LET'S LET'S NOT O CRAZY I WASN'T BEGGING ANYBODY OKAY MSORRYFOLKS IM JUST PAUSING HERE CAN WE GO BACK TO THAT TAPE WE PLAYED LIKE SIXTY SECONDS AGO AND I REMEMBER BEGGING EVERYBODY IN MY HOMEROOM TO NOMINATE ME THANK YOU ANYWAY VOTES WERE IN BALABOX WAS STUFF AND IT CAME TIME FOR THAT BIG EVENT WHERE THEY ANNOUNCED ALL THE WINNERS THE WHOLE TIME I WAS SUPERNERVOUS LIKE EVERY TIME A NEW CATEGORY WAS BEING ANNOUNCED THE WINNERS WERE BEING ANNOUNCED I WAS LIKE ALL MAN IS IT I'R BEGING TO WIN THIS ONE IRE BEGIN TO WHIN THIS ONE IRE BEGIN TO WIN THIS ONE AND LIKE  EVERY TIME SOMEBODY WAS ANNOUNCED AS THE WINNER I WAS LIKE WHO I ATHAK I WONE BECAUSE OF ME OR WAS LIKE AUTION THE GOT THE GIRL THAT I WANTED TO WIN DIDN'T WIN OR YOU KNOW  LIKE I SAID NOT EVERYBODY THAT WE TRIED TO U TO FIX IT FOR ONE A AND THEN WHEN MY FRIEND WHO HELD ME RIGGET ONE HIS CATEGORY AND TAT WHEN I WHEN MY CATEGORY WAS JUST LIKE IT WAS JUST SO SWEET I'LL NEVER FORGET IT THEY ANNOUNCED THE WINNERS AND THE WINNERS WOULD GO UP ON STAGE WE GOT OUR TROPHIES AND THEN HE WENT BACK STAGE FOR A PICTURE THAT WOULD GO INTO THE YOUR BOOK WHICH WAS IMPORTANT TO HIM PROOF OF HIS VICTORY IT WAS THE ALIC A SOMETHING THAT I WOULD NEVER FORGET THERE WOULD BE A PAGE IN THE YEAR BOOK REMINDING ME AND MY FRIEND THAT WE INTERFERED WITH THIS SHIT AND THAT ALL OF OUR FRIENDS OR MOST OF OUR FRIENDS ON THEIR CATEGORY A WETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE I KIND OF WANTED TO AH MAKE IT ABSURD LIKE RIDICULOUS PREPOSTEROUS SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO WON THEIR CATEGORYES ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT HAVE WON THEIR CATEGORIES AND THAT DELIGHTED HIM IN A DIABOLICAL WAY IT DID THEN IN IT DOES NOW THE LACK OF APOLOGY AND HIS CONFESSION WASN'T JUST AN OVERSIGHT WHAT IS THERE TO APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT IS THERE TO APOLOGIZE FOR HONESTLY LIKE YAI WAS AN ASCEL YA WHAT I DID WAS DISHONEST YAT WAS SHADY YAI WAS INSENSITIVE BUT I WOULD DEFINITELY DO IT AGAIN THE EXACT SAME WAY REALLY IF I HAD ABSOLUTELY I WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A NET POSITIVE IMPACT AT LEAST I HOPE SO MAN I HOPE THAT WHAT PEOPLE TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IS THAT YOU SHOULD NOT PUT VALUE INTO THINGS THAT ARE SO ARBITRARY AND SILLY LIKE POPULARITY AND WHO HAS THE BEST HAIR OR THE BEST SMILE OR WHO'S THE BIGGEST FLIRT OR WHO'SE MOST LIKELY TO BECOME PRESIDENT OR WHO'S MOST LIKELY TO WHATEVER IT'S LIKE IT'S JUST A PINION MAN LIKE IT'S COMPLETELY SUBJECTIVE THERE'S NO MEANING BEHIND IT THEN YOU KNOW MICHAEL'S HEARTS IN THE RIGHT PLACE BUT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL THE PERSON FROM MICHAEL'S HIGH SCHOOL CLASS WHO'S MOST CONCERNED ABOUT THESE SENIOR SUPULATIVES H'S MICHAEL IF YOU SQUINT ET IT FOR A SECOND HE CARED SO MUCH ABOUT GETTING IN A WARD FOR CARRYING THE LEAST THE SENIOR RITUS AWORD THAT HE WENT TO QUOTE GREAT LENGTHS TO COMMIT ELECTORAL FRAUD ALSO IN THE COMMENTS BELOW HIS FACE BOOK CONFESSION AND MY CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF HIS CLASSMATES NO ONE ELSE SEEMS AT ALL INVESTED AT THIS POINT AND HO ONE ARE LOST WE ALL YOU GY LAGHER HE LOOSE SHIRASPORT WAS A WARDED CLASS CLOWN IN TWO FOUSIN SEVEN SAYS HE AND HIS FRIENDS WERE NOT THE LEAST UPSET READING MICHAEL'S FACE BOOK POST WE KIND OF

IHAD BE O REMA MAN EN YO ABAU U REMAR A WE WARK IN ARO  AA A A A I I AH I OT IF I ONLY KNEW WHICH NAMES MICHAEL SHECKED OFF ON THIS FATEBILETS I COULD ASK THOSE PEOPLE WHAT THEY THOUGHT NOW IF ALL OF THIS CHANGED ANYTHI FOR THEM BUT MICHAEL REFUSED TO GIVE ME THOSE NAMES HIT WAS ONE THING CONFESSING TO WHAT HE DID IN A GENERAL WAY BUT POINTING TO INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE AND SAYING THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ONE IF NOT FOR ME THAT JUST SEEM MEAN AND UNNECESSARY DID END OF ASKING HIM ABOUT ONE PERSON IN PARTICULAR MARK SNETICER WHO POSTED MICHAEL'S CONFESSION ON TWITTER THEY WERE IN SENIOR LEADERSHIP COUNCEL TOGETHER YE I KNEW MARK VERY WELL HE WAS REALLY POPULAR YE AT THIS POINT MICHAEL TOOK A PEAK IN THE OLD YEAR BOOK HE'D BROUGHT ALONG WITH HIM FOR THE INTERVIEW YE SO HE ON MOST SCHOOLSPIRITED AND HE WONT ALL AROUND HE DID HE WIN THOSE FAIR AND SQUARE OR DID HE WIN THOSE BECAUSE YOU STUFFED THE BALABOG YOU CAN'T HOW THE FUCK A MISEMOSTON WILLAT'S A POINTMENTS YOU VO NO WAY TO KNOW DID YOU VOTE FOR HIM ON THOSE BALLETS THAT YOU STUFFED BEFORE I ANSWER THAT LET'S LET'S ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER I O  WE'LL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER O C WE SOL YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS ANSWER I'M ABOUT TO GIVE YOU HIS ARBITRARY BUT I'M IN TO GIVE IT TO YOU ANY O CA GOOD YET YA I VOTED FOR I WANTED HIM TO WINT CAUSE HE WAS A GOOD HE WAS A GOOD GUY YES I HE WAS DEFI NLY ONE OF THE GUYS I FIXED

GOOD FRIENDS ENOUGH TO HAVE RIGGED IT FOR ME YOU KNOW COOL TEKSLOTE LASH YOU HAV LABEL ME AS MUSCEL SPIRITED FOR TEN YEARS AND I WOULD HAPILY DIESN'T HELP MYSELF OF THAT YOU KNOW YEA YOU I I THE FEXESRY SMIL AS AT MICHAEL AS MICHAEL'S FIND WE HAD A GOOD TIME AND HAS GO TOGETHER SOI I IT'S IT'S NICES TO HEAR THAT SHE A BELIEVED IN ME ENOUGH TO REATE FODS IN MY SHIP IN OTHER WORDS WHILE MICHAEL WORRIED THAT LEARNING THE NEWS MIGHT MAKE MARK FEEL BED IT DIDN'T COME CLOSE IN FACT THE OPPOSITE BUT HERE'S THE REAL EFFECT THAT MICHAEL'S RIGGING THE ELECTION HAD IN THE WAY THAT HE DID IT BECAUSE IT WAS JUST THIRTY FAHE NOWLANCE IN EFFECT WHAT HE'S DONE IS CREATE A SUPERLATIVE SIZED BLACK HOLE OF INFORMATION FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED LIKE HE SAYS A LOT OF THE WINTERS MIGHT HAVE WONE ANYWAY BUT THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE LOT OF THE LOSERS MIGHT HAVE LOST ANYWAY BUT MAYBE THEY WOULD HAVE WON SO WHAT WE'RE LEFT WITH IS AN EXTREMELY RARE O CURRENTS I CAN'T THINK OF ANOTHER ONE IN WHICH A BRAN NEW PIECE OF DEFINITIVE CLEAR INFORMATION THAT THE ELECTION WAS RAY ACTUALLY MAKES IT SO THAT EVERYONE KNOWS LESS THAN THEY DID BEFORE CACON CO IS ONE OF THE PRODUCERS OF OUR PROGRAMME SATTORY TUNNEL

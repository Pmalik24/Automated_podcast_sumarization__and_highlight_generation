HOUR WHAT'S WHAY WHAT WHY BECAUSE YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT COME DOWN TO JONES BEACH WOU REALLY DON'T KNOW ABOUTSWOMEN SO THES YOUESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A CURRENT AND YOU YOU CAN GET A VERY STRONG CURRENTS AT JONSPEECH A THOUSAND RESCUES THAT'S WAY MORE RESCUES THAN DAVID HOSSELHOFTED ON BAY WATCH FIGURE TWO RESCUES PER APISOD TEN YEARS ON THE EIR ROY WOULD STILL BEAT IM BY FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY RESCUEES WHICH IS TO SAY ROY IS ONE OF THE LIFE GUARDIEST LIFE GUARDS THERE IS HE HAD TWO WINDS AT THE NATIONAL LIE GUARD COMPETITION HE SERVED AS AN EXPERT LIFE GUARD WITNESS IN COURT CASES AND ALL WAS WELL IN HIS HAPPY LIFE GUARDING WORLD UNTIL THI SPEEDOF MISCHAR GOSPYGAN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED HIF YOURE LIFE GUARDTED TONES BU YOU HAVE TO TOK TO PHYSICAL THITNESS TEST EVERY YEAR TO PROVE THAT YOU'RE STILL ABLE TO DO THE JOB IT INCLUDES THIS SPEE TEST AN A PORR YOU HAVE TO SWIM A HUNDRED YARDS IN A MINUTE TWENTY WHICH IS ACTUALY PRETTY FAST ET OF THESE GUYS TRAIN ALL YEAR FOR IT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS ROY TOOK THE SWIN TEST IN HIS PREFERRED SWIN SAY A PAIR OF JAMMERS THEY LOOK LIKE BIKE SHORTS WITHOUT THE BUT CUSHION IF YOURE WATCHING THE OLYMPICS RIGHT NOW ALL THE MALSWIMMERS A RANG EM ER TIGHT AND THEY GO DOWN TO JUST ABOVE THE NA UT WHEN ROY SHOWD UP FOR THE TEST AN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HE WAS TOLD NO JAMMERS HIS BOSSIS AT THE OFFICE OF PARKS IN RECREATION SAID YOU CAN ONLY DO THE TEST IN ONE OF THE OFFICIAL JONES BEACH LIFE GUARD SWIMS SUES WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE THREE CHOICES BORD CHORTS TRUNKS OR SPEEDOU BOR CHORTS AND TRUNKS ARE LOOSE SO NOBODY RALLY TAKES A SWIN TEST IN THEM BECAUSE THEY CREATE MORE DRAG AND SO YOU DOWN SO AN EFFECT STATE OFFICIALS WERE SAYING TO ROOY YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE TEST IN A SPEEDO ROY SAID NO WAY I WON'T DO IT AND HE HASN'T BEEN A LIFEGUARDED JONES BEECH SINCE IT WAS ONE OF THOSE FEELINGS LIKE AM I MAKING THE RIKE DECISION I'M TROWING AWAY OF FORTY YEAR CAREER OVER PRINCIPAL IT WAS A DIFFICULT DECISION A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION HOWLONG DID IT TAKE OU TO DESIDE A SECON  IOLY NEED TO POINT OUT HE WOULD ONLY IAE TO WHERE THE BEETO FOR THE TEST WHICH LAST A MINUTE IN TWENTY SECONDS ON THE JOB HED WHERE BORD SHORTS MOST OF THE LIFE GUARDS DO YOUNG ANDOR WHY NOT JUST PUT IT OT FOR THE TEST O WHY DIDN'T MO O POT JUS GO TO THE BACK AT THE BUSS THEY WILL PLENTY OF SHET OF COURSE WHAT ROY WAS FIGHTING FOR IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT ROSAPARKS WAS FIGHTING FOR BUT TO ROY IS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE THIG STANDING UP TO AGE DISRIMINATION WHEN I READ ABOUT ALL THIS IN THE NEW YORK TIMES I REALLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S THE CONNECTION BETWEEN A SPEDO AND AGE DISCRIMINATION IV CERTAINLY SEEN OLDER DUDES AND SPEEDOS SO I WENT OUT MET ROY ON A BEACH NOT FAR FROM HIS HOUSE IN LONG ISLAND IT WAS SIX FORTY FIVE IN THE MORNING HE WAS ABOUT TO GO FOR A MILE SWM BEFORE WORK SO ROY CAN YOU CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOU WARIN RAY NOW WELL IT' SO WET SHU IT SHE SHUT SLY LET SHU AND I MIGJAMMIS ON UNDER BEET ROY BROUGHT ONE OF HIS OFFICIAL JONE'S PEECH SPEEDOS TO THE BEACH TO SHOW ME JUST DESCRIBE IT FOR ME IT'S AN I IN EXAGGURATED SONG TE LET US O THETTL WORKAD BUT IT'S FULL COVERAGE IN THE BACK SO IT'S NOT QUITE A THONG AY ON NOT QUITE A FINE RIGHT BUT TO ROY LOTS OF GUISE IT MIGHT AS WELL BE A THONG WHICH IS WHY THE SPEEDO AS EARND TO STABLE OF NICKNAMES THE WEENY BEKEENY THE DANGLING SLANG THE SPEED DON'T THE BENANAHAMMOCK THE GRAPE SMUGGLER THE MYAMY MEET TENT THE SAN TROPET TRUFFLED NUFFLE THE SCROAT TOAT THE REES IN THE JAMMER IS PREFERRED BY OLDER LIFE GUARDS IS IT YOUR SAYING IT'S MOR DISCREET MODEST MORE MODEST YES THAN THE SPEED OUT YES CAUS IT COVERS YOUR SIZES  I YOU KNOW I I DON'T WANT TO GET CORRESFIT BUT YOURE THE WOD BEGINS WITH BE IS IT BTHA SICLL YO HANGIN OUTR WITH THE WITH THE SPEEDO I GET IT NOW I THINK YOU'LL REALLY ITWIT THE JAMMAG SIT'S NOT LIKE THAT IS LIKE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A ROOF OVER YOUR A HOUSE YES YES  THIS IS THE NUT OF HIS ARGUMENT ROYC SAYS ONCE HE PASSED FIFTY HE FELT SELF CONSCIOUS IN A SPEDOUT AND NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO FEEL SELF CONSCIOUS TO GET A JOB SO ROY REFUSES TO PUT ON THE GRAPE SMUGGLER TO TAKE THE SWIM TEST A FEW WEEKS LATER THERE'S ANOTHER CHANCE TO TAKE THE TEST HE SHOWS UP AND THIS TIME HE IS WEARING THE OFFICIAL SPEEDOUT HE JUST GOT IT ON OVER HIS JAMMERS HE SHOWED ME A VIDIO OF A CONVERSATION HE RECORDED ON THE POOL THAT THAT DAY H'S A LITTLE WINDY SO THE SOUND IS AE GRAT BUT HE STANDING IN FRONT OF SU JULIONI WHO WAS THE DIRECTOR OF JONES BEECH STATE PARK AT THE TIME AND THERE HE IS IN HIS SJAMMERS PLUSPEDO OUTFET CHALLENGING HER TO TURN HIM AWAY I NO  O A O ONE O N  BE    O N ON  NO I  O A  AA AO A  A AN AN E I O A  O      A O  O WA YOU KNOW N O O A O OI O O REIN JOSE GOLES THE DIREC OR OF WATER SAFETY FOR THE STATE BEACHES CUTS IN I ANT WINI DON'T OBI AN MI E A   I I I O WE WON  I WAN I EE ATI IA NO THWHAT DI YE JUST GO HOMETHEN BACIENCTLY IBLIGE STATE AROUND AND I I YOU KNO MUCH DIVE E BODY TAKE THE TEST AN TEM WERE THERE OTHER PEOPLE TAKING T TESTAN JAMMERS NONOW NOBODY WISH ALLOWED TO TAKE THE TEST IN GEMS SHOY EVERYBODY ELSE SEE THE PUNON SPEEDL PUNON THE BOD SHOT SOMETHING LIKE THAT A ROYCE SAS HE COULD HAVE WORN BORD SHORT OR TRUNKS AND STILL PASS THE TEST HE SAYS HE COULD HAVE WORNED DUNGAREES AN PAST THE GUYS IN RIDICULOUS SHAPE HE DOES TRAVEL ONS NOW SUCH AS THE SWIMTY IN TWENTY TWELVE HE HAT A HIPPERPLACE AND SEVEN WEEKS LATER HE CAME IN FIRST IN HIS AGE GROEP AND PERME TO ROUND THE SOUND SWIM RAS I ONE POINT TWO MILE OR WEN WATER SWIM SHE WAS STILL USING A KEEN TO W ALK SO THE EASY THING FOR ROY TO DO WOULD BE JUST TAKE THE TEST AN BOARD SHORTS ARE SPEEDO AND KEEP THE JOB HE LOVED LET BUREAUCRATS BE BUARCRATS JUST GET ON WITH IT THAT'S NOT ROY ROY DOES NOT BACK DOWN FROM A FIGHT SO HE SUID HE SUID THE NEW YORK STATE OFFICE OF PARKS RE CREATION AND HISTORIC PRESERVATION FOR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS NOW THE EASY THING FOR THE STATE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO JUST LET JONES BEACH LIFE GUARDS WEAR JAMMERS PRESUMABLY IF THEY'RE GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE OLYMPIC SWIM TEAM THEY'RE GOOD ENOUGH FOR NEW YORK'S LIFE GUARDS BUT THAT'S NOT NEW YORK STATE IT DECIDED TO FIGHTE THE LOST SUIT HAS WORKED ITS WAY THROUGH THE LOWER COURT WHICH DISMISSED IT TO THE PELLET COURT WHICH RULED AN MAY THAT IT SHOULD GO TO TRIAL THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR SEVEN YEARS SEVEN YEARS ROY SENT ME A P DY EF OF HIS EXHIBITS IN THE CASE IT WAS THIRTEEN HUNDRED PAGES LONG AND THE THING I REALLY ONE TO NOW BECAUSE I LIVE IN NEW YORK O PAY TAXES IN NEW YORK IS WY'S THE STATE US IN TACTFAR DOLLARS TO FIGHT THE SPEED OF SUIT JUST COULD ALL HAVE BEEN RESOLVE VERY EASILY YEARS AGO IF THEY JUS CHANGE THE RULE ALLOWED THE JAMMERS WHYARE ROY IN THE STATE FIGHTING EACH OTHER WHEN THEY SHOULD UNITE AGAINST THE REAL ENEMY JELLY FISH OFFICIALS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK WOULDN'T TALK TO ME FOR THE STORY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WOULDN'T TALK NEITHER WOULD PARKSON RACK BUT THEY DID SEND ME THE OFFIDAVIT OF A GUY NAMED GEORGE GORMAN HE OVERSEES ALL THE PARKS ALONG ISLAND AND IT LEAVS OUT THEIR SIDE OF THE STORY AROUND TWO THOUSAND SIX SOME OF THE JONES BEACH LIFE GUARDS STARTED TAKING THE SWIM TEST IN FULL BODY SWIM SUITS MANAGEMENT BECAME CONCERNED THAT THOSE GUYS WERE ONLY PASSING BECAUSE THEY WERE WEARING THE FULL BODY SWIM SUITS SO THEY DECIDED TO CHANGE THE RULES STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN LIFE GARDS COULD ONLY TAKE THE TEST IN ONE OF THE THREE OFFICIAL JONES BEACH UNIFORM SWIM SUITS NO MORE FUL BODY SUITS AND ALSO NO JAMMERS BECAUSE JAMMERS ARE PART OF THE UNIFORM IN HIS DEPOSITION GEORGE GORMAN SAID QUOTE WE DETERMINED IT WAS BEST THAT THE LIFE GUARDS WEAR THE UNIFORMS THAT THE'RE ARE SIGNED TO WEAR WHILE THEY'RE ON DUTY SEEMS REASONABLE ROY NOT OF YOUR ROY HE POINTS OUT IF JAMMERS REALLY OUR SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER WOULDN'T YOU WANT YOUR LIFE GUARDS TO WEAR A FASTER SUIT GET THEM OUT TO DROWNING VICTIM SOONER AND AS IT HAPPENS NEW YORK PARKS AND RECK ALOW'S LIFE GUARDS TO TAKE THEIR QUALIFYING TEST IN JAMMERS IN THE REST OF THE STATE UP STATE I WENT UP STATE TO TAKE THE TEST AND I WON MY JAMMERS YOU KNOT YOU TOOK THE TEST UP STATE YES AND I WON MY JAMMERS AND PEOPLE WAD THE JAMMAGE AND I HAVE PICTURES OF THAT AND I THAT'S PORDED THE EXHIBIT OBGIGE TAKING THE TEST IN THE JAMMES UP STATE YES THIS SHAME EMPLOYER NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF RECREATION THE SHAME EMPLOYER A LASE THE JAMMERS IT SO YOUR SEARY ABOUT THIS IS THAT THEARE TARGETTING LONG ISLAND BECAUSE WHY BECAUSE NINE DEEP PERCENT OF THE OLDER THE OLD THE FIFTY LIFE GODS WORK ON LONG ISLAND IT'S THE BIGGIST GROUP OF OLDDE LIFE GODS ANYWAY FOR WHAT ITS WORTH THE STATE TOLD ME THAT THE RULES ARE DIFFERENT ON LONG ISLAND BECAUSE IT'S A MORE STRENUOUS JOB LIFE GARDING ON THE OCEANLWIL WAY UP STATE IT'S ALL LEAKES AN POOLS WHY DO YOU THINK IT IS THAT THEY DON'T WANT OLDER LIFE GUARDS WELL I I THINK THEY DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT LD DE LIFE GODS YOU HAVE T INFLUENCE OF AT THE YOUNK OGUGE AND WHEN YOU'RE A MEMBER OF MANAGEMENT YOU DON'T WANT ANYBODY HAVING INFLUENCE OF THE YOUR EMPLOYS EXCEPT YOU AND WHEN YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE UNION AND YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE OFTHISES OF THE UNIINS WHO O ALL OLLD DEGUIGE AND THEY KNOW THE BEACH YOU DON'T WANT THAT YEP THERE'S A LIFEGUARD UNION ROY WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNION FOR YEARS AND AT THAT POINT IN TWO THOU S IN SEVEN WHEN HE REFUSED TO WHERE THE SPEEDO HE WAS THE UNION'S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR WHEN SUDUALLI ON HE TELLS HIM TO FOLLOW THE RULES AA A SHE KNOWS HIM HE IS THE GUY THE UNION SENDS TO ARGUE IT SIDE AND THESE GUYS TELLING HIM WE CAN'T WEAR IS JAMMERS THEY ARE MANAGEMENT IS THIS THE CANTAL HE CLOUD LABOR DISPEUT I ASKED SOME OTHER OLDER LIFE GUARDS ABOUT THIS AND THREE OUT OF THE FOUR OF THEM AGREED THIS IS ABOUT THE UNION WHICH ACTUALLY HAS A HISTORY OF FIGHTING EACH DISCRIMINATION IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX THEY WENT ON STRIKE BECAUSE THE STATE TRADE TO IMPOSE IN AGE LOMEN OF THIRTY FIVE FOR JONESPEECH LIFE GUARDS SO THEY WALKED OFF THE BEACH A WEEK LATER THE STATE KEAT KNOWING THIS THAT THE SUITS IN THE SWIMSATES HAVE A HISTORY WITH EACH OTHER I HOPE ME UNDERSTAND WHAT ROY'S FIGHT WAS REARLY ABOUT ROY TOLD ME ONE REASON HE TOOK US STAND WAS THE MANAGEMENT WAS SUPPOSED TO TELL THE UNION IF THEY WANTED TO CHANGE RULE LIKE THIS AND THIS TIME THEY DEN ROYS GOTO WE GANJOT NOW AT A PRIVATE BEECH CLUB BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME I LIKE WAM WARKING NOW I REALLY DO BUT YOU GET ONE RESCUE A YEAR IF HE A LUCKY AND THEN IT'S O WHAT'S CALLED THE PUDDLE JUMPA WHAT IS A PUDDLE JUMBER UTDLL JUMP FOR HIS WAY YOU REALLY DON'T EVEN NEED TO GET YU HEAD WIT AND YOU YET CHONE SPEECH IN THE OLD DAYS WE WOULD HAVE THESE TREMENDOUS RESCUES JUST THESE GREAT RESCUES HIS FRIENDS FROM JONES BEACH CHEESE HIM THAT HE'S IN EXILE NOW HOW OFTEN D YOU GO VISIT THEM THAT OFTEN I KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THEM CONSTANTLY BUT I DON'T GO DOWN THERE THAT OFTEN TO BE HONESTIT IT DOES HURT IT HURTS TO GO DOWN THERE UM THAT WAS MY BEACH YOU KNOW IT WAS MY HOME FOR SO MANY YEARS IF ROY'S THEORY IS TRUE THEN THE STATE IS TRYING TO GET RID OF THE OLDER LIFE GUARDS ON LONG ISLAND BY FORCING THEM INTO SPEEDOS BY FTHAT'S TRUE AS FAR AS I CAN TELL THE ONLY LIFE GUARD THEY'VE MANAGED TO GET RID OF IS ROYNE  THE NTOF US IS ONE OF THE PODUCES OF OUR PROGRAMME SINCE THE FIRST BRODCAST THIS STORY ROY IS BACK AT JONESPEECH AFTER TWELVE YEARS OF FIGHTING HIM OVER HIS

BECAUSE MY PLAIN TO BAT ROSE WAS BORDING AND I WASN'T SHOW WHAT ELSE TO DO I GOT ON IT THE FOLLOWING MORNING I BORDED ANOTHER PLAIN THIS ONE TO IT LANTA AND THE DAY AFTER THAT I FLEWD HER NATURAL THINKING ALL THE WHILE ABOUT MY EVER SHRINKING FAMILY A PERSON EXPECTS AS PARENTS TO DIE BUT I SIBLYN I FELT I'D LOSS THE IDENTITY I'D ENJOYED SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT WHEN MY BROTHER WAS BORN SIX KIDS PEOPLE WOULD SAY HOW DO YOUR POOR FOLKS MANAGE THERE WERE LOT OF BIG FAMILIES IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD I GREW UP IN EVERY OTHER HOUSE WAS A FEEFTIM SO I NEVER GAVE IT MUCH THOUGHT UNTIL I BECAME AN ADULT AND MY FRIENDS STARTED HAVING CHILDREN ONE OR TWO SEEMED TO REASONABLE BUT ANYTHING BEYOND THAT STRUCK ME AS OUTRAGEOUS I COUPLE HUGH AND I KNEW ENORMITY WOULD OCCASIONALLY COME TO DINNER WITH THEIR WRECKING CREW OF THREE WHEN THEY LEAVE SEVERAL HOURS LATER EVERY LAST HART OF ME WOULD FEEL VIOLATED TAKE THOSE KIDS DOUBLE THEM AND SUBTRACT THE CABLE TOVA THAT'S WHAT MY PARENTS HAD TO DEAL WITH NOW THOUGH THERE WEREN'T SIX ONLY FIVE YOU CAN'T REALLY SAY THAT USED TO BE SIX AND TOLD MY SISTERLESA IT JUST MAKES PEOPLE ON COMFORTABI WE CALLED A FATHER AND SAN AD MET IN CALIFORNIA FEW YEARS

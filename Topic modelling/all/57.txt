WELLFOLKS WE HAVE NOW REACHED THE POINT IN AMERICAN LIFE WOR IN OUR RACIALLY DIVIDED SOCIETY THERE IS A QUICK GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD SO LONG AS YOU ARE A MEMBER OF AN INTEROSECTIONAL GROUP IF YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING WRONG IF YOU ARE ACCUSED OF CORRUPTION IF YOU ARE ACCUSED OF SOME SORT OF MALFEASONS THE GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD IS YOURE ATTACKING MEA BECAUSE I'M BLACK AND THIS HAS SIGNIFICANT RAMIFICATIONS FOR AMERICAN PUBLIC LIFE BECAUSE THE SIMPLE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT IN MERITOCRACY WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO POINT OUT WHEN YOU ARE CORRUPT WHEN YOU HAVE FAILED AND IF EVERY DEFENSE TO FAILURE IS THAT THE SYSTEM ITSELF IS BIASED AGAINST YOU WHELL THAT MEANS THAT YOU'REGOIN TO GET MORE FAILUR SYSTEM WHY THIS TRUE EVERYWHERE FROM POLITICS TO ADMINISTRATION IS TRUE EVERYWHERE FROM THE BUSINESS WORLD TO THE EDUCATIONAL WORLD IF WHEN CLOUDY ENGAY GETS FIRED FROM HARVARD UNIVERSITY THE BASIC IDEA IS THAT IT MUST BE A RACESYSSYSTEM THAT GOT HER FIRED THERE IS NO WAY TO WHOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE IF THEY ARE OF MINORITY RACE IF FOR EXAMPLE YOUARE A POLITICION AND IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU'RE DEEPLY CORRUPT AND YOUR FIRST MOVE IS TO CLAIM THAT AMERICA IS RACIS AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE BEING TARGETED AND IF THAT'S BELIEVED THEN THERE IS NO WAY TO GET RID OF CORRUPT OFFICIALS SO LONG AS THEY ARE OF MINORITY STATUS AND ONCE THAT STANDARD IS CREGATED ONCE THE BASIC IDEA IS THAT CERTAIN PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY HAVE THAT GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD AND OTHERS DO NOT THEN ALL STANDARDS COLLAPSE BECAUSE A DOUBLE STANDARD IS NO STANDARD AT ALL TH LATEST AT ERATION OF THIS PARTICULAR FOOLISH DEFENSE TDEVISIVE DEFENSE COMES CURTESY OF A PERSONAMED TIPHANY HENYARD YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE HERD OF TIPHANY HENYARD BUT THIS IS A BIRGONING AT STORY ABOUT A SMALL TOWN MAYOR WHO'S BEEN ALLEGE TWI ENGAGE INSIGNIFICANT CORRUPTION I ON A VAST SCALED ACCORDING TO THE UCADALYMAL THE FIRST FEMALE MAYOR OF A TINY ELLINOI VILLAGE HAS BEEN SLAMED FOR WUAT LIVING LIKE A ROYAL A TAX PAR EXPENSE BY TAKING A THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR SALARY AND RACKING UP HUGE EXPENSES GLAMORS TIPANY HENYARD WAS ELECTED LEADER OF I DULTED IT'S A VILLAGE OF TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE SHE HAS SINCE COME UNDER FIRE FOR WHAT MANY SAYS HER ACCESS IVE SPENDING SHE REGULARLY ENGAGES THE SERVICES OF A PROFESSIONAL HARON MAKE UP TEA AND STYLIS BEFORE PUBLIC APPEARANCE IS IN PHOTOSHOOTS FOR THE COUNTIES TAXPAR FUNDED BUILLBOARDS THOSE OFTEN FEATURE HER IN WHAT SOME PEOPLE SAY IS SHAMELESS SELF CORMOTION SHE ALSO A TEMPTED TO PROPOSE A NEW LAW THERE OULD CAPE THE NEXT MAYOR SALARY AT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS UNLESS THE NEXT MAYOR IS FURR IN WHICH CASE SHE GETS TO KEEP HER GIGANTIC SALARY HAS BEEN DEEMED ILLEGAL BY MANY PEOPLE THAT IS JUST THE LATEST SCANDAL TO HIT HER SHE WAS SLAMMED FOR HIRING HER FORMER CAMPAIGN WORKER AS THE TOWNS AT CODE IN FORCEMENT OFFICER DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE IS A CONVICTED CHILDS RAPIS SHE ALSO RAISED EYEBROWS AFTER SPENDING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TAX DOLLARS ON SECURITY DETAILS INCLUDING ONE FURNEVENT WITH SENIOR CITIZENS AND ANOTHER OCCATION WHERE SHE PULLED COUGHS COPS OFF THE STREET TO PERFORM A PROTECTION ALTFIT FOR HER SHE ALSO RACKED UP A TRIPS LOST VAGUS WHERE SHE SPEND SOME THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS ON AIR FARE AND SO SHE IS NOW BEING INVESTIGATED FOR ALL THIS AND HERE IS HER DEFENSE A DEFENSE THAT HAS BECOME THE ALL PURPOSE DEFENSE FOR AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN OUR POST GEORGE OF FLOID SOCIETY HERE SHE WAS YESTERDAY TALKING ABOUT HER A LEDGED CORRUPTION AND THE REASONS WHY SHE'S BEING TARGETED YAE BE SINDO GAO YA BLACK YAR BLACK AYACHEN UP YO BE IN A TACKANO A BLACK BAN NA AN PAW YATO BE SIO GYAE ANGAIN THE BASIC IDEA HERES THAT EVEN IF A BLACK PERSON IS ASKING THIS PARTICULAR MAYOR ABOUT HER CORRUPTION IT MUST BE BECAUSE THEY ARE A RACE TRATOR OF SOME SORT AGAIN IF BASIC STANDARDS OF MARITOCRACY AND DECENCY ARE TO BE PUT ASIDE IN FAVOR OF CLAIMS THAT ANY CRITIQUE IS ROOTED IN RACE THAT MEANS THERE CAN'T BE ANY MARITOCRACY ANY MORE WISH OF COURSE IS THE BASIC IDEA THAT SOCIAL JUSTICE CAN ONLY BE ESTABLISHED BY GETTING RID OF BASE LINE STANDARDS OF COMPETENCY AND AGAIN WE SEE THIS ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE UNITED STATES IN A WIVE ARIETY OF PLACIS JUST YESTERDAY WE PLATOCLIP OF MAYOR BRANDON JOHNSON OF CHICAGO BEING QUESTION OVER HIS HANDLING OF THE HUGE MIGRAN CRISIS

SHORT TERM BECAUSE SHE'S A HARIBLE MAYOR BUT SHELL SO HAPPN ME A BLACK LESBEAN AND THEREFORE SHE ALSO CLAIM THAT SHE'D BEEN AUSTED NOT BECAUSE SHE WIS TERRIBLE AT HER JOB BUT BECAUSE SHE WAS BLACK WHEN ASKE AFTER THE ELECTION IF SHE AD LOST BECAUSE OF HER RACE IN A CITY ELEC CHICAGO WHICH IS HEAVILY MINORTY SAID I'M A BLACK WOMAN IN AMERICA OF COURSE SHE'D SAID IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THENEW YORK

ASSUME BUT AGAIN THE ANSWER TO EVERY QUESTION BUT IMPROPRIETY IS NOW RACE IN AMERICA SO LONG AS YOU ARE ABLE TO PLAY THAT CARD ANDIT'S A DANGEROUS CARD TO PLAY IT UNDERMINES STANDARD OF STABILITY AND DECENCY AND PER FORMANCE IN LITERALLY EVERY INDUSTRY THIS IS WHY SEE PEOPLE RANGING FROM BILL ACMEN TO EULON MOS GOING AFTER DIVERSITY AQUITY AND INCLUSION LET'S BE VERY FRANK ABOUT THIS A FIRMERTO THE ACTION AS A PRACTICE IS A ZERO SOM GAME MARITALKCRACY IS THE ONLY FORM OF MEASUREMENT OF PERFORMANCE THAT IS NOT ASERO SOME GAME BECAUSE IT CREATES POSITIVE EXTERNALITIES EXTERNALITIES ARE THE CONSEQUENCES THAT A CRUE TO OUTSIDE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT INVOLVED IN A TRANSACTION SO YOU AND I WE MYVER TRANSACTION THE TRANSACTION PRESUMABLY BENEFITS BOTH OF US BUT IF WE LIVE IN MARITOCRACY ND I'M GOO TO MY JOB IN YOUR GOOD O YOUR JOB AND THEN WE EXCHANGE GOODS AND SERVICES THEN PRESUMABLY THEYRE POS IT OF EXTERNALITIES TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT US I'M GOO TO MY JOB WHICH WEENS I'M HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE YOU'RE GO TO YOUR JOB YOU'RE HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE N NOW WE PRODUCE PRODUCT AT A CHEAPER AND BETTER RATE FOR PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION THAT IS THE BEAUTY OF THE MARITOCRACIES THAT IT BENEFITS EVERYONE MERIT HELPS EVERY ONE WENETHE BEST PEOPLE DO THE BEST JOB AT THE BEST TIME FO THE BEST PRICE THAT ITS GREATE FOR EVERYONE HOWEVER WHEN YOU INSTEAD ARE STACKING EMPLOYMENT FOR EXAMPLE ON THE BASIS OF RACE YOURE TAKING PEOPLE WHO ARE LESS MARITORIOUS AND YOURE FORCING THE PUBLIC TO ESSENTIALLY PAY A SUBSIDY TO EMPLOY THAT PERSON THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH D  NOT JUST THAT ITS DISCRIMINATORY BUT THAT IT COSTS EVERY ONE NOW YOU CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT SINCE THE COSTS ARE DIFFUSE MEANING THAT THEY ACCRUE TO A HUGE VARIETY OF CITIZENS AND THE BENEFITS ARE INCREDIBLY ACUTE MEANING THEY ACCRUE TO ONE PERSON WHO GETS TO BENEFIT OFF THIS NO BIG DEAL BUT TE PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU KEEP DOING THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE COST TO THE SOCIETY START TO GROW AND GROW AND GROW AGAIN AND THAT'S WHAT YOURE STARTING TO SE AND AGENCIES LIKE THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION SO MY FRIEND AND COLLIG MOUT WALSH HE RELEASED A TWITTERI THREAD TO DAY TALKING ABOUT INTERNAL FOOTAGE OF SENIORIFFICIALS THAT THE F A AS FLIGHT PROGRAMM OPERATIONS DIVISION WHICH HE SAYS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF AIR CRAFT OPERATIONS WORK SHOPPING HE PLAN TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF WHITE MAILS IN AVIATION NOW WHY WOULD THAT BE A USEFUL THING YOUAREN'T TALK ABOUT A SITUATION WHERE YOU NEED POSITO EXTERNALITIES HOW IT BEING GOOD AT YOUR JOB WHEN YOUARE DIRECTING AIR CRAFT HOW TO LAND FOR EXAMPLE IT PUTTING A LESS QUALIFIED PERSON IN PLACE BUT THERE THE COSTS ARE NOT T OF FUS THERE'S THE COSTS ARE INPREDIBLY ACUTE IF YOU'RE ON THE PLAIN THAT GETS MISDIRECTED INTO THE GROUND E'S THA LESS QUALIFIED PERSON FOR ANY REASON I'S PUT INTO A PARTICULAR POSITION WHEN THE COSTS REALLY REALLY AR HIGH FOR YOU WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HIGH COST INDUSTRIES LIKE FOR EXAMPLE AVIATION YOU NEED A MARITOCRAY EVEN MORE THAN YOU WOULD IN SAY A LOW COST INDUSTRY LIKE STOCKING A GROCERY SHELF OR SOMETHING WELL MAT  GOT FOOTAGE OF THE F A A ACTING DEPUTY CHEEF OPERATING OFFICE ARE ANGIL MCCOLLUP SAYING THAT MORE WORKERS NEED TO GO FROM RAMP TO COCKPIT MEANING SHO WANT TO SEE MORE BAGGAGE HANDLERS TECOME AIR LINE PIHLOTS AND THEN AS THE METING CONTINUES SHE DECLARES IMPORTANT TO QUOT GET A LITTLE UN COMFORTABLE GET A LITTLE UN COMFORTABLES ALWAYS QUOTE IS ALWAYS A YOUPHEM IS IM FOR OMINTO SAY SOMETHING SUPERRACE TOSTRAIGHT NOW BUT IF YOU'RE WHITE JUST TAKE IT ON THE CHIN AND ACCEPT ID SHE APPARENTLY COMPLAINS THAT FLIGHT OPERATIONS IS QUOTE WHITE MAIL DOMINATED AND TELLS THE MANAGERS THAT QUOTE NEED TWO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE COULD LOOK LIKE HERE SHE WAS  AND  NN TE MAIL TER TETH A A WHILYESN WORST THE AND T O RIGHT IS TEVIOF REPRESENT AN I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE REPRESENTATIONA LEVEL OF THE FEDERAL AVIATION AD MINISTRATION HIT'S ABSURD WHY SHOULD I POSSIBLY CARE ABOUT WEATHER THE DEMI GRAPHIC OF THE F A A IS REPRESENTATIVE IN ANY WAY OF THE BROADER DEMOGRAPHIC DO WE HAVE TO HAVE LIKE A HEAVY SHARE OF HIS SPANIC FEMALES IN ORDER FOR THE F A A TO BE GOOD AT ITS JOB AND FIRST OF ALL YOU'VE A HUGE SELECTION BY IS PROBLEM I' LOVE TO SEE WHAT THE APPLICANT POOL LOOKS LIKE FOR THE F A I PROMISE YOU IT'S MALE DOMINATED JUST START WHAT THAT BUT BEYOND THAT WHAT IN THE HELISHY TALKING ABOUT WHY IN THE WORLD WHAT I IF YOU'R TALKING ABOUT A JOB WHERE YOUR PERSONAL LIFE EXPERIENCE MEANS LITERALLY NOTHING MAKING SURE A PLAN GOS WHERE ITIT IS SUPPOSE TO GO IS NOT ONE WORTS A LI GREW UP IN IDIVERSE NEIGHBORHOOD AND I'D A BMUNCH OF FRIENDS ADVERSE BACKGROUNDS AND THAT'S REALLY INFORMS HOW I DO MY JOB AS A PERSON WHO MAKES SURE THE PLAIN LANDS ON TIME WHERE IT'S SUPPOST TO LAND IT'S THE DUMBEST THING I EVER HEARD I'M IN TOGMELIC ENGLISH LITERATURE OR SOMETHING SUBJECTIVE LIKE THAT YOU'R TALKING ABOUT MAKING A PLAIN LAND IN A PLACE WITHOUT HITTING ANOTHER PLAN THAT'S FOR YOUR TALKING ABOUT I DON'T COR THE GRUP POOR OR RICH YOU HAVE ONE JOB IN ONE JOB ONLY AND ALL I CARE ABOUT IS THAT YOU GOOD THAT JOB ON'T COR ABOUT ANY OF THE OTHER THINGS BUT AS MAT POINTS OUT THIS ACTUALLY IS A PROBLEM INAVIATION JUST AS IT WOULD BE IN ANY OTHER JOB WHEN YOU LOWER THE STANDARDS FOR THE JOB SOAS TO ACHIEVE A QUORTICL DIVERSE WORK FORCE WHAT YOU ARE ACTIVELY DOING IS MAKING THE EMPLOYMENT BASE WORSE AT THEIR JOB THAT IS WHAT IT IS GET'S MORE ON THIS IN JUST ONE SECOND FIRST NOW N ACTUALL LIKES TALKING ABOUT LIFE INTRANCE CAN A DARK RIGHT BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

PRIORITIZES CALLED INDIAN TRIBAL OWN CORPORATIONS AND SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGE BUSINESSES FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND CRITICAL GRAND FUNDING AGAIN BOTTOM LINE HERE IS COMPETENCE AND MARITOCRACY ARE GOOD FOR EVERY ONE AND THE THE PREDICTABLE RESULT OF ALL THIS BY THEWAY IN TE EMPLOYMENT MARKET IS ACTION MAKES IT HARDER FOR PRIVATE EMPLOYERS TO EMPLOY PEOPLE WHO ARE QUALIFIED OF MINORITY GROUPS BECAUSE WHEN YOU AS AN EMPLOYER ARE DECIDING AND WE HEAR DELYUARE OBVIOUSLY BY BY ALL FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS I HAVE TO SAY THAT BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE ANALAR B SENDS ME AN ANGRY NOTS FOR USING MIFHREE SPEECH THEY DONE I BEFORE WE ABIDE BY ALL FEDERAL AND STATE AND LOCAL REGULATIONS AND LAWS OQE WE'VE SET IT NOW HERE IS THE REALITY ABOUT HIRING IN THE UNITED STATES IS A BROAD TREN AS A BROAD TREND WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHETHER HIRE SOMEBODY ONE OF THE THINGS YOU ARE CONSIDERING IS THE POSSIBILITY OF LIABILITY DOWN THE LINE LEGAL LIABILITY DOWN THE LINE AND THE MORE WE CREATA SYSTEM AND WHICH WE SAY THAT IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF AN INTERSECTIONAL GROUP NOT ONLY AM I SUPPOSED TO HIRE YOU IF YOU ARE LESS MARITORIOUS THAN THE WHITE GUI NEXT TO YOU BUT ALSO IF I DECIDE THAT OU'RE NOT GOOD AT THE JOB AND I FIRE YOU I NOW MAY FACE A DISCRIMINATION LAW SUIT WHY WOULD I HIRE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE ENACTIO MAKES IT LESS LIKELY THAT IT QUALIFIED MINORITY CANS IT WILL GET THE JOB TBECAUSE OF THE RISK OF LIABILITY THAT IS NOW ATTACHED ALL THIS IS DEVASTATING TO AMERICAN PUBLIC LIFE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT ALSO RESULTS IN A MISREED OF SITUATIONS WHEN SOMEONE IS IN COMPETENT AND THEY HAPPEN T BE MINORITY N MAKES IT EASY FOR PEOPLE TO ACTIVELY SAY OH IT MUST BE THEIR IN COMPETENT BECAUSE THEYE ARE MINORITY WHEN THAT ISN'T TRUE IN COMPETENT EXIST ALL OVER THE SPECTRUM THE BEAUTY AGAIN OF A MARITOCRACY IS IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T MAKE THE STANDARD IT'S CLEAR THEY DIN'T MAKE THE STANDARD BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T MAKE THE STANDARD AS WELL NOTE THE STANDARD IS BUT IF THE STANDARD NO LONGER APPLIES AND YOU'R BEING HIRED BASTED ON YOUR RACE OR BASED ON YOUR ABILITY TO DO AS THESE MAYORS ARE DOING AND SIMPLY BLAME THE MAN FOR YOUR OWN PROBLEMS WHEN THAT HAPPENS AND THEN THE PERSON FAILS THEN IT'S EASY FOR PEOPLE TO MISS A TRIBUTE DAT TO RACE TAT SUPPOSE TO PROPERLY ATTRIBUTING IT GTO THE GENERAL SINFULNESS AND FAILURE OF MANKIND ALL THE STUFF IS DEEP AND IN STARK AND TO HUGE PROBLEM FOR THE UNITED STATES O AMERICA S WHY D YI HASK TO GO D YI IS TERRIBLE FOR THE UNITED STATES AND EVERY VESTIGE OF THIS ARGUMENTS THAT INCOMPETENCE CAN BE COVERED FOR BY CLAIMS ABOUT AMERICAN RACISM THAT CRIMERATES CAN BE COVERED FOR BY CLAIMS ABOUT AMERICAN RACISM THAT A EDUCATIONAL UNDER PERFORMANCE CAN BE COVERED FOR BY CLAIMS ABOUT AMERICAN RACISM ALL F THAT REDUCEIS IT REDUCES THE ABILITY OF SMART CAPABLE PEOPLE OF ALL RACES TO GET AHEAD AND MAKE THE WORLD BETTER PLACE FOR EVERYONE WHO SURROUNDS THEM TE ENTIRE SOCIETY RIT LARGE OGAN MEANWHILE THE MEDIA ARE DOING IT THEIR BEST TO GO AFTER THERE PRESUMED OPPONENTS INSANE STORY FROM ENBUSY NEWS TARGETING ANOTHER HONE MY FRIENDS HIRATCHIC SHE IS THE CREATOR OF LIBS OF TIKTOK THERE RIB ON CHIA APPARENTLY IS THAT BECAUSE SHE IS POSTING TRUE STORIES THERE ARE BUNCH PEOPLE WHO READ HER STORIES THAN THEY SEND ATHREATS THIS IS NOT CALLED A NEW STORY IS NOT IT IS NOT IF I COVER THE NEWS AND THEN BECAUSE I HAVE A VERY LARGE AUDIENCE THEREARE SOME NUTS WHO GO AND DO NUTS THINGS THAT IS NOT MY FAULT THAT IS THE FAULT OF THE NUTS AND YET THAT IS PRESUMABLY ENBUSY NEWS IS BASICALLY SAYING THAT WE NEED TO SHUT DOWN FREE

MANY OF THESE BON THRATS TURN OUT TO BE HOAXES ITS ON CLEAR WE'VE EN SENT MANY THESE BO THREATS SOME O THSE PEOPLE MAY NOT EVEN B FOLLOWERS OF KHIA BUT THE GOALL HERE IS TO SUGGEST THAT SOCIAL MEDIA OUGHT TO SHUT HER DOWN BASED ON THE ACTIVITIES OR FOLLERS NOW THIS A SUPER DANGEROUS PRECEDENT AND IT'S AMAZING THAT A FREE PRESS IS ATTEMPTING TO PUSH THAT FOR THE FREE PRESS OF ALL PEOPLE IN AMERICA SHOULD BE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT THEY WISH FOR HERE IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE IDEA THAT BAD COVERAGE OF ISSUES IS NOW TO BLAME FOR THE BAD ACTIONS OF PEOPLE WHO COVER THOSE ISSUES THEN THE MEDIAS CAN HAVE A LAH TO ANSWER FOR IN AMERICA IT'S PERFECTLY EASY TO SAY THE BLACK LIVES MATTER RIOT IVE TWENTY TWENTY CAN BE LAID ALMOST ENTIRELY AT THE EET OF THE AMERICAN MEDIA IF THAT'S THE CASE AT'S A REALLY EASY ARGUMENT TO MAKE BUT THEY'RE GOING AFTER CIABECAUS AGAIN THIS IS WHAT THE MEDIA DO THE MEDIA HAVE DECIDED THAT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS ONLY APPLIES TO PEOPLE WILL AGREE WITH THEM SO ACCORDING TO ENBICY NEWS RATCHICK IS NOT ACCUSED OF MAKING ANY BODTHREATS IN IWALL OR ANYWHERE ELSE WHICH MEANS THAT ITS NOT A STORIE SE NORMALLY WHEN I DON'T AKE A BON THREAT THERE'S NO STORY ABOUT ME IF

REPORTERS FOR REPORTING SO LONG AS THE PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW THE REPORTERS A SMALL CADRAY OF WHOM JU BAD THINGS CAN SOMEHOW BE BLAM ON THE REPORTER THAT THAT'S THE GOL HERE AND THIS NOW MERGES WITH THE BLOW BACK THAT TUCKER KARLSON IS RECEIVING FORE DOING AN INTERVIEW WITH LADERPOTEN NOW I HAVEN'T SEEN TH INTERVIEW OF LADRPOOTEN YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THEINTERVIEW WITH GLADERPOOTEN NO ONE IS SEEN THE INTERVIEW WITH GLADMRPOOTEN THAT INTERVIEW IS SUPPOSED TOHIT THE AIRWAVES TO NIGHT ON AC AND AS I'VE SET I'M I CAN A PRE JUDGE THE INTERVIEW THE QUESTION IS WHETHER'TUCKER ASKED HIM ANY HARD QUESTIONS OR WHETHER IT WAS SORT OF A MASSAGE NOW I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN IT IT WILL BE A BAD ACT OF JOURNALISM IF TUCKERD IES NOT ASK HIM SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT TO HAVE IN GERSHKUITCH THE THE WALSER GENERAL RPORTER WHOS BEING HELD BY GLADINMERPOOTEN AS EFFECTIVELY A HOSTAGE OR IF RT DOESN'T ASK HIM ABOUT WHAT THE END OF THE WAR LOOKS LIKE OR VERIS'N PUSHAM ON HIS MURDEROUS RECORD OR IS ABUSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN HIS TARGETING OF CIVILIANS AN U CRANE AND ALL THE RESTRAT THERE ARE HEIR BUNCHF QUESTIONS THAT TUCKER AUGHTASK BE TUKKRASN ASKED ANY OF THIS QUESTION PUBLICLY YAT SO IHAVE NO IDEA WHAT HE ASKED THI SIMPLE FACT THAT TUCKER IS TUCKER AND WENT TO RUSSIA IS NOW CAUSING APPARENTLY SOME PEOPLE IN THE E U TO THINK ABOUT SANCTIONING HIM AGAIN THIS IS THE UNBELIEVABLE STUPIDITY OF POLITICS PEOPLE WHO CLAIM THAT THEY HAVE ANY SORT OF PRINCIPLE ABANDONE THOSE PRINCIPLES AT THE FIRST SIGN AT THOSE PRINCIPLES MIGHT BE HARMFUL TO THEIR POLITICAL INTEREST IT TRULY IS AN AMAZING THING ACCORDING TO NEWSWEEK TUCKER KARLSON'S INTERVIEW WITH RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMERPOOTEN COULD SEE THE CONSERVATIVE PON AT TARGETED BY EU LAW MAKERS CURRENTS AN FORMER MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN PIRLIAMENT OF TOLD NEWSWEEK CARLSON VISITED RUSSIA THIS WEEK ON TUESDAY HE REVIELED THAT HE WOULD SOON BE RELEASING INTERVIEW WITH POOTEN CARLSON'S WORK IN RUSSIA COULD SEE THE FORMER FOX NEWS HOST IN HOT WATER WITH THE EU ACCORDING TO GIVE OR HOFSTAT A FORMER BELGIAN PRIME MINISTER AND CURN MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT THE LAW MAKER DESCRIBED CARLSON AS A MOUTHPIECE FOR FOR MER PRESENT IN TRUMP AND PUTEN IS WELL ADDING QUOTE AS PUTEN IS A WAR CRIMINAL AND THE U SANCTIONS ALL WHO ASSISTS TO HIM IN THAT EFFORT IT SEEMS LOGICAL THE EXTERNAL ACTION SERVICE EXAMINE HIS CASE AS WELL NOW HONESTLY IS LIKE THE BEST THING THAT INTERMS A MEDIA COULD HAPPEN TO TUCKER HAVING THE EU TARGET TUCKER FOR DOING AN INTERVIEW WITH LADMER POUTEN MAKES TUCKER'S CASE FOR HIM TUCKERS AN TIRER CASE WITH REGARD TO LADMER PUTND VLADMER'S LENSKY HAS ESSENTIALLY BEEN THAT THE ATTEMPTS BY THE MEDIA TO DRAW A STARK DIVISION BETWEEN VLADMERS LENSKIS AD MINISTRATION IN U RANE AND VLADMER POUTENS ADMINISTRATION IN RUSSIA IS MISS BAGOTTEN THAT ZLENSKY IS ENGAGED IN CORRUPTION THAT HEIS ENGAGED IN DICATROIAL BEHAVIOR BY THE WAY THER'S SOME TRUTH TO LOT OF WHAT TUCKER IS SAYING ABOUT THAT IN MY OPINION THAT STILL DOES NOT JUSTIFY A FULL SKALL RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRANE OR SUGGESTED ITS AN AMERICAS INTEREST TO SEE U KRANE FULLY IN JUSTED BY RUSSIA NOR DO I BELIEVE THAT VLADMER POUTEN SOMEHOW HAS YU KRANES VEST INTEREST AT HEART ALL THESE THINGS CAN BE TRUE AT ONCE BUT IF THE CASE THE TUCKER IS MAKING IS THAT THE EU IS PERFECTLY HAPPY TO SHUT DOWN FREEDOM OF SFEEGE BUT THEN THEY COMPLAIN WHEN VLADMERPOUTENT DOES IT THERE MAKE IN TUCKER'S CASE FOR HIM WHEN THEY SAY THIS ACCORDING TO NEWSWEEK THE U'S EXTERNAL ACTION SERVICE IS THE BLOCKS DIPLOMATIC ARM RESPONSIBLE FOR FOREIGN POLICY FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO BE ADDED TO THE U SANCTIONS LEST EVIDENCE MUST BE PRESENTED TO THE E A S FOR A VIEW IF DEEMD SUFFICIENT THE E S CAN THEN PRESENT THAT CASE TO THE EUROPEING COUNCIL WHICH IS THE BODY  MADE UP OF U NATIONAL LEADERS WHICH TAKES THE FINAL DESISION ON WETHER TO IMPOSE IT SANCTIONS OR NOT NOW AGAIN HIGHLY UNLIKELY BUT THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE SAYING THAT THEY AGREE WITH THE STANDS THAT TUCKER SHOULD BASICLLY BE TREATED AS A PROPAGANIS ON BEHALF OF THE CREMLEN NOW  I THINK A HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT THAT IS IS WHAT'S GOING TO TAKE PLACE BUT A DEMONSTRATES ONCE AGAIN IN THE SAME WAY THE MEDIA TARGET ING HIRACHI SHOWS IT JUST SHOWS THATIF YOU VIOLATE CERTAIN TABOOS OR IF YOU CAN'T STAN ON ONE SIDE OF THE POLITICAL ISLE AND NOT ANOTHER SIDE OF THE POLITICALA POLITICAL ISLE ALL PRINCIPALES WITH REGARD TO SAY FREESPEECH GO BY THE WAYSIDE NOW AS I SAY NONE OF THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION AS WHETHER TUCKER'S GENERAL PRORSPECTIVE ON UKRANE IS RIGHT I HAPPEN TO THINK THAT A GENERAL PRERSPECTIVE ON UKRAN IS SHORT SIGHTED AND WRONG I DO NOT THNK THE WORLD IS A BETTER PLACE IF LADMERPOUTEN WALTZES IN TO KEEVE AND SIMPLY TAKES IT OVER AT THIS POINT THERE THERE IS A A GROLLING TREN LINE ON THE RIGHT THAT IS A PROBLEM ONE O THE BIG DIVISIONS CON RIGHT AND LEFT IN THE UNITED STATES HISTORICALLY SPEAKING HAS BEEN THAT PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT TEN TO TINK THAT AMERICA KICKS ASK AND PEOPLE ON LEFT TENTO THING NOT THAT IS BY PULLING DATA HERE FOR EXAMPLE IS SOME OF THE POLLING DATA FROM PUW RESEARCH CENTER THE QUESTION WAS WHETHER  THE U S STANDS ABOVE ALL OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD MEANING LIKE WERE THE BEST WHETHER THE US IS ONE OF THE GREATEST COUNTRIES ALONG WITH OTHERS OR WHETHER OTHER COUNTRIES ARE BETTER THAN THE U S AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THAT OVER THE COURSE OF THE TIME PERIOD TWO THOUSAND LEVEN TO TWO THOUSAND IN TWENTY THREE DEMOCRATS HAVE BASICALLY DECIDED ON MASS THAT THE THAT NO ONE AMONG THE DEMOCRATS BELIEVES THAT THE UNITED STATES TO THEGEATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD EXTREMELY LOW NUMBER IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THIRTY ONE PRESENT OF DEMOCRATS SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES STOOD ABOVE ALL OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD AS OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE THAT NUMBER WAS NINE PER CENT NINE PER CENTS A FEWER THAN ONE IN TEN DEMOCRATS OR THOSE WHO LEAN DEMOCRAT BELIEVES THAT AMERICA IS BETER THAN ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD WHEN IT COMES TO WHETHER PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT OTHER COUNTRIES ARE BETTER THAN THE UNITED STATES IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN ONLY EIGHT PER CENT OF DEMOCRATS SAID THAT OTHER COUNTRIES ARE BETTER THAN THE UNITED STATES AS OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE THAT NUMBER IS NOW THIRTY SIX PER CENT THIRTY SIX PERCENT OF DEMOCRATS BELIEVE OVER ONE AND THREE THAT OTHER COUNTRIES ARE BETTER TAN THE UNITED STATES WHICH DOS RAIS THE QUESTION IS TO WHY DON'T YOU THEN GO TO ONE OF THOSE COUNTRIES WHI TOMORE ON THIS IN JUST ONE SECOND FIRST FOR MY CATHOLIC LISTENERS LENT THE FORTY DAYS LEADING UP TO EASTER THAT STARTS ASH WEN SDAY FEBRUARY FOURTEENT IT'S A TIME OF

PUBLICANS HAVE BEEN VERY CANSISTENT IN THEIR BELIEVE THAT AMERICA IS IN FACT BUST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD IN TWO THOUSND ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN PER CENTS OF AMERICANS BELIEVED THAT AMERICA WAS AT THE BEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD ONLY FIVE PER CENT OF AMERICANS BELIEVED OTHER COUNTRIES WERE BETTER THAN THE UNITED STATES FAST FOUR TO TWENTY NINETEEN SAME NUMBERS FORTY SIX PER CENT OF REPUBLICANS BELIEVED THAT AMERICA WAS THE BEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND ONLY FIVE PERCENT OF AMERICANS BELIEVED THAT OTHER COUNTRIES WERE BETTER THAN THE UNITED STATES BUT IF YOU FAST FOR TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE THAT NUMBER HAS NOW DROPPED FIFTEEN PER CENTS ONLY THIRTY ONE PER CENT OF REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT AMERICA IS TBETTER THAN ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD AT NOW SEVENTEEN PER CENT ARE JUST UNDER ONE IN FIVE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT OTHER COUNTRIES ARE BETTER THAN THE UNITED STATES THERE IS A A GROWING CENTS AND IT'S CONNECTED TO JOBIDON BEING ELECTED BUTS NOT TOTALLY DUE TO JOBIN BEING ELECTED THERE'S A GROWING CENTS THAT THINGS ARE FALLING APART IN THE UNITED STATES AND THIS IS PLAYING OUT IN SOME STRANGE FORM POLICY TERMS AND THAT THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN SORT OF THIS UNDER LYING IDEA ON THE PALIO CON RIGHT THAT VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING GOES WRONG IN THE WORLD IS DUE TO AMERICAN OVER EXTENSION THAT THAT IT'S AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY IN THE POST WAR ERA THAT IS CREATED ALL PROBLEMS NOWT THIS NEGLECTS THE FACT THAT IT WAS AMERICAN FORIM POLICY THAT DEFEATED LEGITIMATELY THE GREATEST THREAT OF THE TWENTIETH CENTRY WHICH WAS NOT NOTZO GERMANY THE GREATEST THREAT OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURIES F THE SOVIET UNION BECAUSE THAT THROAT LASTED LITERALLY FROM THE SOVIET REVOLUT TION OF NINETEEN EIGHTEEN ALL THE WAY FORWARD UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY IT WAS A WASING FOR GENERATION THREAT AND THE UNITED STATES DEFEATED THAT S THAT MAKES FOR A PRETTY GOOD FOREIGN POLICY THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD FORIGN POLICY RECORD AND WHEN YOU POINT TO THE SHORTCOMINGS OF AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY SINCE THEN THOSE ARE VERY REAL BUT AMERICAN HEGEMANY HAS CREATED FREEDOM OF THE SEES AMERICAN HEGEMANY HAS CRATED FREEDOM OF TRADE AMERICAN HEGEMNY HAS INSURED A HUGE PERCENTEG OF THE GLOBE HAS RISEN FROM POVERTY AND YES EDISON SURED THE PROSPERITY OF AMERICAN CITIZENS I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS THE AND BAZARE NOTION THAT AMERICANS NOW ARE LIVING WORSE THAN THEY DID IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THERE IS NO DATED TO SUPPORT US THE NOTION THAT AMERICANS WERE LIVING BETTER IN NINETEEN EIGHTY I PROMIT I JUST EASY QUESTION FOR ANY ONE WHO BELIEVES THAT WOULD YOU WISH TO GO BACK AND LEAVE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY MATERIALLY SPEAKING NOT SPIRITUALLY SPEAKING MATERIALLY SPEAKING JUST INTERMIS THE STUFF YOU HAVE THE ANSWER IS NO NO ONE WOOD BECAUSE THE WAY THAT YOU ACTUALLY MEASURE WETHER AN ECONOMY HAS MOVE FORD IS THE KINDS OF PRODUCTS GOODS AND SERVICES YOU CAN NOW OBTAIN FOR YOUR TIME IN THE WORK FORCE AGAIN ALL ILL REFERED TO A BOOK ALLED SUPERABUNDANCE HERE BY MARIAN TUP AMONG OTHERS THAT'S REALLY GOOD THAT CAN A BREAKSDOWN JUST HOW ECONOMIC PROGRESS IS WORSED IN THE UNITED STATES THE REASON THAT I POINT THE SOUTH I'S BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS LIKE RUSSIA VERSES YOU CRANE THE QUESTION OF WHETHER AMERICA IS A POSITIVE FORSED IN THE WORLD IS VERY MUCH GETTING TELESCOPES INTO A NARRATIVE ABOUT RUSSIA AND YOU CRANE SI HAS SAID BEFORE YOU'RENOUH TO BE A GREAT LODIMER'S LENKY LOVER TO GREE THAT IT IS NOT IN AMERICA'S INTEREST FOR RUSSIA TO WIDEN IT'S TO RECT SPER OF GOVERNANTS INTO YOU CRANE OU CRANES AN INCREDIBLY LARGE TERRITORY IT HAS SIGNIFICANT WHEAP RESOURCES IT DOES HAVE PORTS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN FOR THE WEST YOU CRAN ALSO HAPPENS TO BE THE BORER INTO VERTUALLY ALL OF EUROPE IT'S HUGE COUNTRY MEAN TO UNDERSTAND  HOW VITALLY IMPORTANT YOU CRANE IS TO THE EUROPIAN MAP Y AVE TO LOOK AT A MAP OF EUROPE IN LOOK AT YOU CRANES WORDERS SO HERE IS A PICTURE OF WHAT EUROPE LOOK LIKE WHEN THE SOVIETS WERE DOMINATING THE EASTERN BLOCK AT THE WAR SAW PACK THAT'S THE THE COUNTRIES IN PINKER THESE WERE ESSENTIALLY COUNTRIES THAT RULED INDIRECTLY BY THE SOVIET UNION AND AS YOU CAN SEE WHEN THE SOVIET UNION WAS ROUND THE BORERS OF THE SOVIET UNION WHENT ALL THE WAY UP TO GREASE IN THE SOUTH THEY WENT ALL THE WAY WEST TO AUSTRIA AND WEST GERMANY IN THE WEST AND DENMARK AND THY INCLUDED POLAND EASGERMANY CHECKS LOCKA HUNGRY ROMANIA BULGARIA AND THAT MENT AS EVERY ONE SORT OF NEW THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF A SERIOUS WORLD WAR WAS PRETTY HIGH BUTDO YOU WALK ACROSS THAT WORD FROM EAST WEST GERMANY BUTH SYMTANKS AND SUDENLY UNWORLD WORTH RA AY IN THE POST WAR EUROP THAT MAP CHANGES AND NOW WHAT YOU SEE IS A BUNCH OF NEWLY INDEPENDENT COUNTRIES THAT BEN BROKEN AWAY FROM THE WARSAW PACT AND NO LONGER PART OFTHE WORS AW PACTIES ARE INDEPENDENT COUNTRIES THE INDEPENDENT GOVERNANCES AND HISTERY DIDN'T STOP FOR THESE PEOPLE I WAS JUST IN POLAND CAVE THE POLISH PEOPLE DO NOT WISH TO BE DOMINATED AGAIN BY THE RUSSIANS THEY DON'T IF YOU LOUODNT KNOW ANYTHIG ABOUT POLISH HESTRY BUT YOU'LL REALIZE IS THAT FOR A VERY LONG TIME FOR ABOUT A SE NCHERY AND A HALF BEFORE THE RECONSTITUTION OF POLAND IN THE AFTROMOUTH OF WORLD WERE ONE THERE WAS NO POLAND WHO IS BASILLY DIVIDED UP BETWEEN THE OSTRA HUNGARIAN EMPIRE AND THE RUSSIANS AND THE POLISH PEOPLE HAVE NOTDIS IRE TO BE DOMINATED BY THE RUSSIANS AGAIN AN AND IFYOULL THAT OLD THAT OLD MAP THE RUSSIANS DID RUN POLAND AND THAT IS WHY THE SOLIDARITY MOVEMENT WAS CREATED IT'S WHY POLAN SOUGHT TO BREAK FREE OF SOVIA DOMINATIAN AND SO WHEN YOU GO TO THE NEW MAP WHAT YOU SEE IS A BUNCH OF COUNTRIES THAT DO NOT WISH TO BE DOMINATED BY THE RUSSIANS RANGING FROM FINLAND AND SWEDEN IN THE NORTH TOASTONIA LOT OF YELITHUANIA THE BALTIC STATES THOSE INCLUDE OF COURSE POLAND SO IF FOR EXAMPLE RUSSIA WERE'T YOU TAKE YOU CRANE SO THE WAY THAT THIS MAPWORKS BELLEROUS IS ON THE BORDER OF RUSSIA BELLEROUS IS EFFECTIVELY A RUSSIAN CLIENT STATE BELLERUS WAS USED AS A STAGING POINT FOR THE INVASION OF UCRANE IN THE FIRST PLACE BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO IF YOU CRANE WERE TO BE TAKEN OVER WHAT YOU OULD NOW SEE IS THE RUSSIANS BUTTING UP AGAINST POLAND BUTING UP AGAINST HUNGARY BUTING UP AGAINST ROMANIA BUTTING UP AGAINST MUCH MORE OF WESTERN EUROPE IT IS NOT AN AMERICA'S INTEREST TO FACILITATE RUSSIA'S OWNERSHIP OF THE RESOURCES IN OU CRANE NOR IS IT IN AMERICA'S INTEREST FOR RUSSIA TO NOW BE ON THE BORDERS OF A BUNCH OF OTHER COUNTRIES THAT THEY WOULD THEN TRY TO BREAK  ONE THE OTHER THINGS THE CONSEE FROM THIS MAP IS THAT T E BALTIC STATES ARE IN SERIOUS DANGER LIKE EVERY DAY OF EVERY YEAR ASTONIA LOTGIAN WITHUANIA IT IS ONLY THE SECURITY GUARANTEES OF NADO THAT IN SURE THAT RUSSIA DOES NOT WALK OVER THE BORDERS INTO THE BALTIC STATES HOW EASY WOULD IT BE FOR RUSSIA TO SIMPLY TAKE LITHUANIA THE ENTER IS REALLY REALLY EASY THEY AREADY RUN COLININ GRAD A COLENGRAD IS IS ACTUALLY A RUSSIAN TERRITORY THAT EXISTS ON THE BORDERS OF POLAND AND LITHUANIA EVE NOITES NOT TERRITORIALLY CONTIGUOUS WITH RUSSIA SO HOW EASY WOULD WHI WISELETHLANIA FREEKING OUT YOU KNOW WI LITHALANIA IS FREEKING OUT AND AGAIN RUSSIA HAS INMADED MANY OF THESE COUNTRIES BEFORE RUSSIA ALREADY TOOK OVER CRIMEA WHICH YOU CAN SEE ON THIS MAP IN THE SOUTH OF YOU RANE RUSSIA HAS ALREADY TAKEN OVER PARTS OF GEORGIA AS YOU CAN SEE ON THIS MAP RUSSIA'S THREATEN CASSIC STANDWHICH IS ALSO IN IT SOUTH AWSO SO CHECKING A RUSSIAN TERRITORIAL EXPANSION IS IN AMERICA'S INTEREST ESPECIALLY IS NOT CAN ACCOST US ACTUAL BLOOD THE WORE TO SPENDING MONEY ON IT SO ALL THSE THINGS CAN BE FOR ONCE BECAUSE FORM POLICY IS REALLY COMPLEX I I'LL BE FASCINING TO SEE WHAT TUCKER ACTUALLY ASKS POUTENT ABOUT I WILL BUT AGAIN THE BASIC IDEA THAT AMERIC HAS NO INTEREST IN WHAT RUSSIA DOES IN OU CRANE EVEN TO THE EXPEND OF SPENDING TO MONEY IS PRETTY WILD TO MA I ALSO POINT OUT THE MANY OF THE PEOPLE THEREAE SOME PEOPLE WOARE PRETTY CONSIST IN ABOUT NOT SPENDING MONEY WIDELY PEOPLE LIKE THOMAS MASSY HE'SE CONSISTENT WE ON'T WAN SPENDALOT OF MONEY ON ANYTHING INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAMS A THOMAS MASSEY IS IN ACTIAL PHYSICAL CONSERVATIVE I DIS AGRE ITHN ABOUT FORIGN POLSY BUT LEASIS CONSISTENT PROM MI HAVE OF THE LOT OFTHE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMPLANING ABOUT SPENDING ON U CRANE FOR EXAMPLE IS THAT THEY ARE PERFECTLY FINE WITH EXPANDING SOCIAL SECURITY ABENEFITS MEDICAR BENEFITS MEDICADE BENEFITS THET ARE BANKRUPTING THE UNITED STATES IN FACT THE CONGRUSSIONAL BUDGED OFFICE JUST RELEASED AE A POR THAT FEDERAL INTEREST PAYMENTS NOW EXCEED TEFEND SPENDING FOR THE FIRST TIME WHICH IS AN INSANESTATISTIC WE ARE NOW PAYING MORE ON OUR FEDERAL DEBT JUST THE INTEREST TEN WE SPEND ON OUR MILITARY BUDGET EVERY YEAR TAND THAT'S ONLY GOING TO CONTINUE FOR THE REST OF TIME THAT EFFECTIVELY BY THE WAY MEANS THAT WERE ACTUAL GIVING MONEY TO CHINA TO PAY OFF OUR NTEREST IN ORDER IS THAT WE CAN THEN SPEND MONEY HON OUR MILITARY WHICH IS REALLY BADTO OWTHEY THE WORSTSPENDING TOMENCH MONEY ARGUMENT DOESN'T WORK IF YOU'RE ALSO A PERSON WHOSE IN FAVOR OF SIX SEVEN TRILLIAN DOLLAR BUDGETS AND IS UNWILLING TO TALK ABOUT THE RESTRUCTURING OF AMERICA'S NATIONAL DEBT AND JUST ONE SECOND WE'LL GET TO THE SITUATION ON AMERICAS SOUTHERN BORDER WHICH OF COURSE OF MORE INTEREST I THINK VASTLY MORE AMERICANS THAN WHAT HAPPENS IN NOU CRANE I CARE OT FORM POLICY TO BUT I'VE SEE THE SOUTHERN BORDER I THINK MATTERS TLOT MORE FIRST THE DAILY WIRE IS LOOKING TAD AN EXPERIENCE SENIOR SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGER TOR MARKETING TEAM THIS UNIQUE POSITION WILL PROVIDE LEADERSHIP IN GUIDANCE ON VARIOUS AT DAILY WIRE SOCIAL MEDIO PAGES IF YOU HAVE OVER FOUR YEARS OF EXPERIENCE MANAGING SOCIAL MEDIOTIMES NOW'S THE TIME TO APPLY DON'T MISS OUT ON THIS EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY TO DO AMAZING WORK THAT MATTERS EVERY SINGOLE DAY JOIN US IN SHAPING THE FUTURE OF CONSERVATIVE MEDIA AS OUR SENIOR SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGER IF YOUR INTEREST IN JOINING OUR TEAM VISIT DAILY WIRED OUT COM SLASH OF CAREERS THAT'S DAILY WIRE DOT COM SLASH CAREERS TO DAY O CAN MEANWHILE THE SITUATION ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER CONTINUES TO JUST BE A COMPLETE MASS AMAZING STORY OUT OF FOX NEWS LAST NIGHT AND HERE'S WHAT IT' SAYS THE WHITE HOUSE ON THURSDAY ANNOUNCE THAT YOU US EMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS IN FORCEMEN WILL SOON BE FORCED TO REDUCE OPERATIONS AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER DO TO LACK OF FUNDS SO THE WHITE HOUSE IS NOW THREATENING THAT UNLESS THEY GET THE BORDER BILL THAT THEY WANT THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE IT WORSE AT THE BORDER NU'ST BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS THERE'S PLENTY OF FUNY AT THE BORDER ALL THE WITE HOUSE HASE TO DO IS PUT BACK IN PLACE REMAIN A MEXICO AND ALL THESE PROBLEMS GO AWAY ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS REALICATE BORDER PATROL OFFICERS AWAY FROM THE PROCESSING OF ILLEGAL EMIGRANTS INTO THE AMERICAN INTERIOR AND GO BACK DO YOU KNOW POLICING ILLEGAL IMIGRANS AND THEN QUICKLY TO PORTING THEM IT'S ALL THEY HAVE TO DO JOR BITIN CAN DO IT RIGHT NOW TBUT INSTEAD HE'S BASICALY THREATENING TO MAKE THE PROBLEM WORSE BECAUSE HE'S SOMEBODY WHO DEEPLY CARES ABOUT THE BORDER YOU SEE PRESS SECRETARY COREENGSON PARE TOLD REPORTERS THAT BECAUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE NOT PASSED HE BY PARTISIN BORDER SECURITY AGREEMENT WITH FUNDING FOR ISRAIL INU CRANE THE ADMINISTRATION IS LEFT WITH NO CHOICE BUT TO PULL BACK SHE SAID DURING A GAGLON OUR FORSE ONE YESTERDAY QUOTE TBECAUSE CONGRESSIONAL RE PUBLICANS ARE CHOOSING PARTISAN POLITICS OVER OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND REFUSING TO PASS THE BY PARTISAN AT NATIONAL SECURITY AGREEMENT THAT INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT BORDER REFFORMS IN FUNDING OVER THE COMING WEEKS ICE WILL BE FORCED TO REDUCE OPERATIONS BECAUSE OF BUDGET SHORT FALLS ALH IS THAT WHAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW SO IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BIGGEST EMIGRATION WAVE IN AMERICAN HISTORY YOURE ENOVE TO REDUCE OPERATIONS CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVEN OF MONEY YOUR ONLY SPENDING SEVEN TRILLIAN DOLLARS A YEAR I BELIEVE YOU I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS JUST A GAMBIT IN ORDER TO MAKE THE PROBLEM WORSE AS A THREAT AI MEAN YOU WONT O TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO DO NOT LIKE AMERICA IT'S HARD TO ARGUE LOVE AMERICA WHEN YOUR BASICLY THREATENING THAT UNLESS YOU GET A BILL THET'L LET'S YOU OFF TO HOOK FOR YOUR OWN BORDER MOLFEASINTRICAN MAKE THE BORDER WORSE THAT'S AN AMAZING AMAZING STATEMENT ATD ALSO POINTS OUT WHY POLITICALLY IT IS SO FOOLISH FOR RE PUBLICANS TO THE SENATE TO BE TALKING BAHOITS TIME TO GET SOMETHING DONE NOW LISEN THERE ARE THINGS THAT THE SENATE COULD DO THAT WOULD BE TRULY WORTH WHILE LIKE REALLY TIED JOBIDON'S HANDS THEY REALLY TIED JOBIDON'S HANDS THOW BE WORTH WHILE BUT AGAIN I'VE READ THE BORDER BILL IT DOES NOT TIE JOBIDON'S HANDS IN ANY SERIOUS WAY WHEN I COMES TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BORDERBILL THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS STILL GOING TO BE USING PROSCUTORIAL DISCRETION THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS STILL GOING TO BE DIRECTING ASYLUM OFFICERS TO LET PEOPLE INTO TE COUNTRY ON THEIR OWN RECOGNIZANCE THE CHANGE IN THE ASYLUM DEFINITION WHUTD HAVE TO BE STRICTLY AND COHERENTLY A PLIED WHICH IS SOMETHING JOBIDON HAS REALLY SHOWN LITTLE INTEREST IN DOING REMEMBER THE CURRENASYLUM STANDERD IS THE YOU HAVE TO SHOW A REAL FEAR OF GOING BACK YOUR HOME COUNTRY TO CLAM ASYLUM AND THAT HAS NOW TURNED AN IMPLEMENTATION UNDER JOBIDON INTO JUST SAYING THE MAGIC WORDS NOW NORMALLY IF THERE'S A LEGAL BURDEN ON ME TO SHOW FOR EXAMPLE TAT I'VE A CREDIBLE FEAR OF GOING BACK TO MY HOME COUNTRYI'D HAVE TO SHOW YOU A POLICY PROCEDUR A SET OF DEAT THREATS THEY'D MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE BE FOR ME TO GO BACK TO MY HOME COUNTRY IT YOU'RE TRYING TO ESCAPE OLIVIA BECAUSE YOU'RE THE TARGET OF AN ACTUAL DRUG CAR TEL AND YOU CAN SHOW THEME DOCUMENTATION OF THIS IS THE CASE THAT BE A GOOD CASE BUT THAT'S NOT WHATS HAPPENING PEOPLE ARE SHUNG UP IN THE BORDER SAYING THE MAGIC WORDS AND BEING RELEASED INTO THE INTERIOR SO NOW ALL THAT WILL HAPPEN IS THEY'LL SATE NEW MAGIC WORDS AND BE RELEASED INTO THE INTERIOR WHAT'S AN I UNDERSTAND THAT SENATORS WANT TO GET THINGS DONE I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY FEEL LIE THEY CAN GET NOTHING DONE IN THE SENATE UNDER THESE POLORIZED CIRCUMSTANCES THE POLARIZATION IS BEING EXACURBATED BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SO THAT MEANS ONE OF TWO THINGS EITHER THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH HAS TO ACT IN TANDUM NOT TO WORK AGAINST ONE ANOTHER BUT TO TIE THE EXECUTIVE'S HANDS YOUE THE MEMBERS THE LEGISLATIVE HAVE TO BE ORIENTED AGAINST THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND TIE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCHR'S HANDS OR THERE WON'T BE ANY COMMON GROUND THAT IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR SO YESTERDAY SENATOR CHRISTMERFYIVE CONNECTICUT HE TWEATED OUT OF SPEECH BY SENTER JAMES LANKFORD WHOIS THE OKLOHOM UP SENATOR WHO'S BEEN PUSHING FORR THE BORDERBILL IN WHICH LANGFORD TALKS ABOUT HOW PROBEMS AREN'T BEING SOLVED IN THE SENATE IN ORDER FOR A PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED IN THE SENATE THE QUESTION IS WHO ARE YOU ORIENTING AGAINDST YOU ARE NOT ORIENTING AGAINST THE PROBLEM OF A OF A OPEN BOARDER THAT'S NOT WHAT YOURE ORIENTING AGAINDS YOUARE ORIENTING AGAINST THE PROBLEM OF AN EXECUTIVE BRANCH THAT TOES NOT CARE ABOUT THE LAW WHICH MEANS THAN LESS YOU ARE ACTIVELY FORCING THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH INTO THE CORNER YOU'RE BILD DOESN'T TO SQUAT THAT'S THE PROBLEM HEREWAS LANK FOR YESTERDAY ON PRESENT WEN O OT YES TO BE ABLE TO MOVE ON THIS BILL SWE CHANGE IN THE WALL I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE DIFFERENCES BUT WE'VE GOT TO YOU SIT DOWN TOGETHER FIGURE OUT HARBURG AN A SALL PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SENT US HERE TO DO THAT NAY WHALL AGAIN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SENT YOU TO SOLVE THE BORDER PROBEM THAT PROBLEM IS NOT SOLVABLE UNLESS YOU TIE THE EXECUTIVES HANDS THE DEMICRATARN' CANN'T DO IT SO NO DEA THAT'S EFFECTIVELY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT HERE NOW MEANWHILE THE SENATE IS MOVING ON TO IT'S NEXT PRIORITY WHICH WAS ALWAYS REALLY THE FOREIGN AID AN ALL THE STUFF GOT TIED TOGETHER DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT YOUAD BEEN DISAGGREGATED FROM THE START AND I GOT TIED TOGETHER FOR ARIETY OF REASONS ITS STARTED OFF AS JUST A SERIES OF STANDALON BILT ONE FOR A DU CRANE ONE PHRADE ISRAEL ONEPHRAE TIWON AND A BORDERBIL AND THEN WHAT HAPPENE IS THAT JOBIDEN TIED TOGETHER EU CRANE AND ISRAEL AND RE PUBLICANS WHO ARE KIND OF DICE ON THE EUCRANE AID BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY SPENT AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT S MONEY IN EUCRANE BLUS TERE IS IN FACT TO WING OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THT OISN'T RELY CARE WHAT HAPPENS IN GAVE AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT DEMOCRATS TIED THE TWO TOGETHER THE UNDERSTAND REPUBLICANS WANT THE ISRAEL EIGHT AND THENDERSTAND DEMOCRATS WANT THE CRANADE AND THEN REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE SAID O KA WELL IF YOU'RE TYING NAT TOGETHER THAN RURGNATI AND SOMETHING YOU DON'T LIKE A BORDERBILL AND THEN REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE PROCEEDED TO RITEPRY BAD BORDERBILL  SENAAS BEING STRIPPED OUT AND SO NOW THERS CAN BE ATTEMPT TO AGAIN TIED TOGETHER THEU CRANAD AND THE ISRAEL AID ACCORDING TO THE WALSTRE JOURNAL SEND AT DEMOCRATS TRIED ON WEDNESDAY TO PIN DOWN MORGIO PIECE SUPPORT FOR A BILL THAT PROVIDE MILITARY AITSUCRANE ISRAEL AND OTHER ALLIES THE BROADER MEASURE WAS THE PRODUCT OF FOUR MONTHS OF BY PARTISAN

SAID THOSE AR OOD QUESTIONS AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY ANSWERS AT THE MOMENT SO UNCLEAR WHATS CAN A HAPPEN WITH THE WITH ANY AID BILL MOVING FORARD MEANWHILE WHAT IS TRULY AMAZING IS THAT AGAIN THE MORE CONTROVERSIAL PROVISION THE ONE THAT THAT OBVIOUSLY HAS LOTTED TO BE ATTACHED TO IT IS THE FAR LARGER ADE PACKAGE DIRECTED UCRANE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT BY PARTISAN SUPPORT FOR ACTUAL SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL IN FACT THE HOUSE ATTEMPTED TO MOVE AN ISRAEL AD BILL ON TUESDAY FOR ABOUT SEVENTEEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS AND THEY GOT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY VOTES FOR ID WHICH AGAIN COUNT THOSE VOTES THAT'S

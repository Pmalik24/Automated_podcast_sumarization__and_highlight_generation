VER PRECIOUS FOR MEU EE OF COURSE WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE MEMBERS OF BOY HITS CAR IN MY OPINION MY FATHER IS THE LEAST LIKELY CANDIDATE TO BECOME A SYMBOL OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM OF SPIRITUAL INTROSPECTION OF THE HEALING POWERS OF NATURE AFTER ALL THIS IS A MAN WHO BELIEVED ALL THREE OF HIS CHILDREN SHOULD GET PCHDES IN ENGINEERING OR ELSE THEY WOULD STARVE IN THE STREET THEN AGAIN ALL THESE THINGS MAY BE A MATTER OF PERSONAL INTERPRETATION SO YOU SEE MY FATHER'S NAKEDNESS AS KIND OF THAT REBELLION OF SOME SORTER NO NOT ACTUALLY I A SON YES JUST HE'S BE NATURAL I FEEL THAT HE AS A

OFFENDE RULE ONE OF PARENTAL LIFE NEVER WASTE FREE BABY SITTING BUT ALL SEVEN GUESTS AT MY DAUGHTER HALEY'S SEVENTH BIRTHDAY PARTY WE'RE DROPPED OFF BY THEIR PARENTS MYSTERIOUSLY SEVEN MINUTES EARLY THAT SORT OF BEHAVIOUR IS JUST PLAYIN RUDE IT WAS LIKE BEING SWARMED BY A GANG FROM PLANET TINY THEY DROPPED THEIR COATS IN THE HALL AN IMMEDIATELY SCATTERED TO THE FARTHEST CORNERS OF THE HOUSE LIKE SOME NEW INSTANTLY CONTAGIOUS FORM OF BIOLOGICAL WEAPON I STAGGERED UPSTAIRS WITH A SMALL MOUNTAIN OF COATS IN MY ARMS WHICH IS NOT A CHORE I SAW MYSELF PERFORMING BACK WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND LONGING TO BE GROWN UP EVEN WHEN I WAS ELEVEN I WANTED TO BE MARRIED BECAUSE MARRIED PEOPLE I KNEW HAD SECS EVERY NIGHT OF THEIR LIVES THAT'S ANOTHER STORY I WAS LOGGING COATS BACK DOWNSTAIRS TRISH THE MOTHER OF CATY HAILEY'S BEST FRIEND TWO BEST FRIENDS AGO TRISH SHOT ME A KNOWING LOOK MAGICIAN WRIHT HOW CAN YOU TELL I SAID FIBR OPJIC WANS BY THE FORKS THAT WAS THE FIRST HINT THAT MY WIFE AND I MIGHT HAVE GONE SLIGHTLY OVER THE TOP BIRTHDAY WIVE THAT WE MIGHT HAVE STEPPED OVER THE STRICT MORAL BOUNDARY THAT SEPARATES CARRING THOUGHTFUL PARENTS WHO WHO BELIEVE IN PERSONAL ATTENTION AND QUALITY TIME FROM CHEESEBALLS LIKE US WHO TRID TO BUY THEIR WAY INTO THEIR CHILDREN'S HEARTS IT'S EASY TO COMMIT THAT SOCIAL GAF THESE DAYS MY WIFE AND I BOTH WORK THE HARDER WE WORK THE GUILTIER WE FEEL THE MORE WE WANT HAILY'S BIRTHDAY PARTIES TO BE WELL VISIBLE FROM OUTER SPACE WOULD BE GRATIFYING WE'D BEEN PLANNING HAILEY'S SEVENTH BIRTHDAY ORE TO BE SLIGHTLY MORE ACCURATE MY WIFE JOHANNA HAD BEEN PLANNING IT AND I'D BEEN DOING NOTHING FOR WEEKS WHAT THERE WAS WAS A CAKE ICED BY PROFESSIONALS IN THE SHAPE OF A MAGICIAN'S TOP HAT WHICH COST THIRTY BUCKS EIGHT LUTBAGS FILLED WITH THOUGHTFUL AGE APPROPRIATE PEANUT FREE PARTY FAVORS AT FIFTEEN DOLLARS A BAG ND OF COURSE THE MAGICIAN HIMSELF HAT A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS FOR TWO HOURS HE CALLED HIMSELF THE AMAZING ROBERT I DON'T THINK HE MEANT THAT IRONICALLY NO I LIKE TO DO SOME ESPECIAL ON HALY'S BIRTHDAY STILL DON'T YOU THINK I SAID TO MY WIFE IS SHE FRANTICALLY TRIED TO FIND A MAGICIAN WHO WASN'T BOOKED THREE MONTHS IN ADVANCE DON'T YOU THINK WE MIGHT BE OVERR AMPING BUT HONEY IF WE DON'T GO SLIGHTLY CRAZY JOHANA SAID QUITE LOGICALLY SOME OTHER PARENT WILL THEN WHAT'S HELIGAN A THINK AND ANYWAY DO YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA AND I DID NOT HAVE A BETTER IDEA MY SOLE CONTRIBUTIAN TO THE MAGICIAN PARTY HAD BEEN TO SUGGEST THAT WE INCLUDE A WHOOPY CUSHION IN EVERY LOUTBAG OR OR AT LEAST IT WAS MY IDEA TO BLOW THEM UP AND PUT THEM IN THE LUTBAGS PREINFLATED IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN HALY WAS SMALL WE KEPT HER BIRTHDAY SIMPLE I LEARNED THAT LESSON WHEN I LIVED IN LOSS ANGELIST NEAR BEVERLY HILLS IN BEVERLY HILL'S PARENTS LIKE THEIR CHILDREN'S BIRTHDAY PARTIES TO HAVE A THEME AND A VERLY SIGNIFICANT THEME AT THAT MANIFEST DESTINYE SAY OR OR A NASS OF MOONSHOT IN ELLE I NEVER WENT TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY THAT FEATURED ANYTHING LESS THAN PONY RIDES IN ONE MOTHER ACTUALLY GAVE OUT GOOTCHEE TEA SHIRTS IN THE LOOT BAGS IT WAS HARD TO COMPETE WITH THAT IN AN ACT OF DEFIANCE OF FRIEND OF OURS A STRUGGLING RITER STAGED HER DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY IN A PARK OF ALL PLACES KIS HAD A GOOD ENOUGH TIME THEY RAN AROUND AND SWUNG ON SWINGS AND PLAYED TAG AND GENERALLY REVELLED IN A WHOLE TWO HOURS WHEN THEY WEREN'T UNDER THE WATCHFUL EYE OF ANANNY OR ARMED RESPONSE SECURITY THE GRAB BAGS CONTAINED WHAT GRAB BAGS ARE SUPPOSED TO CONTAIN CANDY RATHER THAN ROLEX WATCHES AFTERWARDS THE BEVERLEY HILL'S PARENTS FLOCKED AND LITERALLY FLOCKED ROUND OUR FRIEND FABULOUS IDEA THEY SAID NATURE WHO WOULD HAVE FOUGHT CAN I STEAL A THEME BUT OUR FRIEND CATHERINE IS THE QUEEN OF THE LESS IS MORE EASY ON MUMMY BIRTHDAY PARTY SHE SAYS CHILDREN WANT STRONG EXPERIENCES NOT NEW ONES WHICH IS WHY LAST WEEK AND FOR HER DAUGHTER MARY SEVENTH BIRTHDAY CATHERINE INVITED SEVEN SIX GIRLS OVER TO STRING GUMMY BEARS ON TO EXTRA LONG BAMBOO SATE SKEERS THAT WAS THE THEME OF THE PARTY SKUERING CANDIES ON A STICK THERE WAS SOME RISK OF I INJURY AND THE ENTIRE GIMIC SEEMED TO HAVE FROIDY AN UNDERTONES THE LITTLE GIRLS KEPT SAYING I'M GOING TO STICK THIS SKEWER UP GAMMY'S TINY BUT AND GIGGLING HYSTERICALLY BUT ALL IN ALL IT WAS A WINNER ONLY ONE GIRL BARFED THE ENTIRE PARTY CAST FIFTEEN BUCKS CANADIAN IT IS TRUE THAT CATHERINE HAD A PINATA PINATAS ARE EXCELLENT BECAUSE THEY ENTAIL HITTING AN OBJECT VIOLENTLY WITH A STICK THOSE WHE'RE THE OLD PRE BACCANALIAN BIRTHDAYS BY THE TI HAILY TURNED FIVE THE YEAR OF OUR MOST CORRUPT AND THEREFORE MOST SUCCESSFUL BIRTHDAY WE' GONE AS LOW AS A PARENT CAN GO WE'D HIRED HUMAN BARBY FOR THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS HUMAN BARBY DRESSED UP IN FULL SIZED VERSIONS OF BARBY DALL OUTFITS AND CAME TO YOUR HOUSE HUMAN BARBY ARRIVED IN A DODGE GRAN CARAVAN WITH HUMAN MIDGE HER ASSISTANT TWO GIANT MOBAL RACKS OF PARTY DRESSES FOR THE GIRLS A TE SET IN A CASE A TWO CHESTS OF MAKE UP SHE DRESSED THE KIDS DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF MULTIPLE CAREERS AND FED THEM CAKE ALL OUR FRIENDS WERE COMPLETELY HORRIFID I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SAID OH THIS YERE HAILY'S HAVING A RPARTY WE'RE HAVING A CAKE MADE OF CRACK TO MY CANADIAN FRIENDS PUT THIS CRASSNUSS DOWN TO THE FACT THAT JOHANA MY WIFE IS AN AMERICAN BUT SUCCESSFUL WHILE IT WAS AS IF THE DALI LAMA HAD MADE O STOP AT OUR HOUS THE GIRLS WERE HITN ATIZES WITH AWE THEY SPENT MOST OF THE AFTERNOON STANDING IN A CIRCLE BRUSHING HUMAN BARBY'S HER I HAD THE FEELING THAT SECRETLY QUITE A FEW MUMS WOULDN'T HAVE MINDED GIVING IT TO TRY THEMSELVES AS IT TURNED OUT I NEEDN'T HAVE WORRIED ABOUT THE AMAZING ROBBERT THE MAGICIAN EITHER HE WAS A A HANDSOME GUY WITH SIDE BURNS AN A AN A RY IF SOMEWHAT RESIGNED MANNER HE KNEW WHAT HEWAS DOING THOUGH HE HE STARTED CRACKING JOKES AWITH THE KIDS RIGHT AWAY YOU MUST BE HAILY SAID TO ONE OF THE BOYS AS HE WALKED THROUGH THE DOOR NO PETER SAID I 'M A BOY AND CLAPPED HIS HANDS HAY THE MAGICIAN SAID NO CLAPPING TO ALL THE KIDS CLAPPED I SAID NO CLAPPING BY THE TIME HE START O PULLING EGGS OUT OF THEIR NOSES YOU KNOW THEY WERE GONERS I CHOSE THAT MOMENT TO RUN UPSTAIRS I FIND I NEED A MOMENT ALONE AT REGULAR INTERVALS AT THESE KITTY BIRTHDAY BASHES ALSO AT ADULT PARTIES IN FACT I COULD USE A MOMENT ALONE RIGHT ABOUT NOW BUT WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR TO MY BEDROOM WHAT DO I FIND LYING LYING ON MY BED SURROUNDED BY ENTIRE MOUNTAIN RANGES OF MINIATURE WINTER COATS TWO OF MY ADULT GUESTS HOLDING HANDS THEIR SPOUSES WERE DOWNSTAIRS I MUST SAY THEY PLAYED AT COOL HE HEADACHE THE WOMAN SAID RUBBING HER

REAPPER BATRICH KATY'S MUM SHE KEPT STARING AT THE MAGICIAN I THOUGHT SHE DISAPPROVED OF HIS TRICKS BUT THEN SHE GAVE A LITTLE SHRIEK I KNO SHE SAID I KNEW I KNEW THAT MAGICIAN HE HAS JUST COME

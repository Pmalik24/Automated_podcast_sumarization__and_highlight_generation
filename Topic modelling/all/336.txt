FATHER AND THEN MARRIED HIS MOTHER IN ORDER TO BECOME THE KING THE PLACE FOR HOURS LONG THE MAIN CONFLICT OF THE PLAY IS A GUIDE DEBATING IN LONG COMPLICATED MONOLOGUES WHETHER OR NOT HE SHOULD KILL SOMEBODY WHAT IS THERE IN THAT FOR MOST OF US TO RELATE TO WHY SUPCORS WE HAPPEN TO BE MURDERERS N WHAT OULD THE WAY BE LIKE IF IT WERE ACTUALLY PERFORMED BY MURDERERS ANOTHER VIOLENT CRIMINALS WHAT

ACTOR SOD AROUND TABLES IN THI SINTER BLACK LAST ROOM BENEATH INSPIRATIONAL SLOGANS BELIEVE IN YOURSELF THINK POSITIVELY THE ASPIRING CAST IS HALF BLACK HALF WHITE AND RANGES FROM YOUNG LIFERS IN THEIR TWENTIES TO OLD TIMERS IN THEIR FIFTIES BECAUSE IT'S AGAINST THE RULES TO CONGREGATE AN AUDIENCE OF FELLONCS FOR THE FOUR HOURS IT WOULD TAKE TO PERFORM THE WHOLE PLAY AGNES IS STAGED ONE ACT EVERY SIX MONTHS STARTING IN DESEMBER NINETEEN NINETY NINE TO NIGHT IS THE FIRST GREED THROUGH AT FIVE THE FINAL BLOODY CLIMAX MANY THEIN MADES HERE NEVER FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL AND ALL THET HAD KNOWN OF SHAKESPEARE WAS THE FHRASE TO BE OR NOT TO BE TO NIGHT THE AHERING SOME OF THE OTHER FAMOUS SPEECHES FOR THE FIRST TIME PESTILENCE ON HIM FOR A MAD RUGE ROGUE ROGUE HE PORED A FACK LAGON A FLAGIN OF RENISH RENISH ON MY HEAD ONCE THE SAME SCULLS SIR WAS SURE YORIC SKULL THE KING'S GESTURE LES BORE YOUR I KNEW HIM ARACIO TE FELLOW'S INFINITE JIST OF MOST EXCELLENT FANCY HE HAVE BORE ME ON HIS BACK AR THOUSANDS I MUST REETHRIS WITH ANY CLASS OR TERRIBLE OR THIS ONE IS TERRIBLE DO THE ACTORS KNOW IT BUT THEY PLOUGH ON THROUGH THE SCRIPT AND IN MAT NAME PAUL WHO SERVES IS AGNES AS ASSISTANT DIRECTOR EXPLAINS WHY FIRST TWO REACTS AT AOO THERE S NOTHERE'S NO WAY WHER TO GET THIS SANG DOWN AN GO THE ELIVE PERFORMANCE IN E WAS SOLILOQUALLY TO PAGS LON OTHETHERS NO NO THIS IS IS IMPOSSIBLE BUT WELL ERD IN HERE I GUES S FROM PERFORM IN IN HERE AT DONE TIME AGAIN WAS THE IU'LL BECA IT'LL WORKINT THE LOCAL CRITICS AGREED WITH PAUL THE ACT FOUR PERFORMANCEER TO REVIEW IN THE SAINT LOF HIS PAPER THE ACTORS WERE SAID TO BE COMMANDING AND COMPELLING BUT THE ENTIRE PERFORMANCE THE REVIEWE ROAD A FOUR HUNDRED YEAR OLD TEXT IS RESTORED TO FRESHNESS IT SEEMED HARD TO IMAGINE EN I'VE SEEN HAMLET A DOZEN TIMES I'VE SEENED HAVE INCLINED TO IT AT THE PUBLIC THEATRE  I SAW THE FAMOUS DIINED VINORA VERSION THREE NIGHTS IN A ROW AGES SOWHT IN MA BERGMANS PRODUCTION DON A BROOKLAN PERFORMED ENTIRELY IN SWEEDISH WHAT ELSE IS SAID TO LEARN FROM WATCHING ANOTHER HAMLET S BUT THE TRUTH IS THIS PRODUCTION WAS DIFFERENT BECAUSE THIS IS APPLAY ABOUT A MAN PONDERING A VIOLENT CRIME IN HITS CONSEQUENCES PERFORMED BY VIOLENT CRIMINALS LIVING OUT THOSE CONSEQUENCES AFTER HANGING OUT WITH THIS GROUP OF CONVICTED ACTORS FOR SIX MONTHS I DID DIS COVER SOMETHING I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM  REMEMBER HOW IT STARTS HAMLET SEES HIS FATHER'S GHOST WHO EXPLAINS HE WAS MURDERED BY COLAUDIUS HAMLET'S UNCLE THE GHOST COMMAND HAMLET TO AVENGE HIS DEATH BY KILLING CLAUDIES THE PLAY IS BASICALLY HAMLET PONDERING THIS SINGLE HERIFIC ACTION AND WHETHER HE CAN BE THE MAN TO DO IT TO BE OR NOT TO BE THESE DAYS WHEN PEOPLE SAY THE NAME HAMLET IT'S USUALLY JUST TO METAPHOR SHORTHAND FOR SOMEBODY WHO WAS AFRAID TO ACTWHO DITHERS AND THINKS TO MUCH WE ON MUST FORGET JUST WHAT ACTION HAMLET WAS CONTEMPLATING THESE ACTERS HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN THE NAME IS MAMLET JOHNSON AND IM THIRTY SIX YEARS OLD I HERE FOR TWO FIRST THREE ASSAULTS A PLAY HAMLET WHEN YOUARE ON STAGE DOING HAMLET WHAT DO YOU DRAW UPON IN YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE TO MAKE THE THE CHARACTER COME TO LIFE THE IDEA OF WANTING TO HEARD SOMENE I HAVE EXPERIENCE HURTINGS ON ONT TO KNOW TO TO THE ONE OF THEIR IN THEIR LIFE MAY BE IN DANGER I WAS  VERY CONFUSED AN ANGRY PERSON ON AND YOU KNOW IT ES CALATE INTO YOU KNOW ME CHOOTING A TWO PEOPLE AND LEAVING THEM FOR DID  OH MY NAME IS CRIS HARRIS ON THIRTY IGHT YEARS OLD AND I PLAY THE FOURTH CHARACTER OF HAMLET LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING THE CHARACTER OF HAMLET IS PLAYED BY FOUR PEOPLE THEY ARE ALL ON STAGE AT THE SAME TIME TAKING TURNS DELIVERING THE LINES AGNES TOD THIS PARTLY TO GIVE MORE ACTORS SPEAKING ROLLS AND NOT SADLE ANY ONE MAN WITH ALL THAT DIALOGUE BUT IS THEATERE IT WORKS HAMLETS ROLL IS FULL OF LONG SOLILOQUIES AND RETORICAL ASIDES THIS SMALL GANG OF HAMLETS WHICH MUTTERS TO ITSELF AND LAUGHS AT ITS OWN JOKES NICELY CAPTURES THAT FRACTURED QUALITY OF HAMLET'S DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES AND IT'S ALSO BONDED THE FOUR ACTORS TOGETHER THEY CALL THEMSELVES THE HAMLETS AND CONSTANTLY TALK ABOUT THEIR CHARACTER TO CHRIS IT SEEMS LIKE HAMLET IS JUST THE FIFTH GUY IN THEIR ODD CLEAK ANOTHER CRIMINAL WITH A COMPLICATED PAST LE PUT IN TERMS OF YOU'RE TWO THOUSANDS WILL BE HAVE AS AN UPPER MIDDLE CLASS YOUNGSTER NINETEEN TWENTY YEARS OLD AWHO COLLS SMELL WILL TO DO FAMLY YOU KNOW THEY WON'T QUITE A BIT OF LAND O THE PEOPLE IN A SMALL TOWN RESPECT IM A LEVEL AND A IS UNCLE A MURDERD THIS FATHER AND IS NOW MARRIED TO HIS MOTHER SO I MEAN ALL KINDS OF SERIOUS ASYU IR ALL KINDS CHRISTEN THE HAMLETS PRACTICE ALONE MOST DAYS FINDING TIME WHEN THE FOUR CAN JUST GET TOGETHER BY THEMSELVES AS TOUGH WHEN THIS ALWAYS A THOUS AND INMATES AROUND SO THEY DO IT WHERE THEY CAN ON EVERY SUNDAY AFTER THE NOON MEAL THE FLORIS WILL ASSEMBLE WILL HAVE OUR LITTLE GRAY HAMLET BOOKS AND WE'LL POSEE DOWN TO THE TRACK AND IF YOU ARE SIMPLY WALKING BYE WHICH YWOU'D PROBABLY HERE IS YOU'D HEAR THIS CHATTER OF SOMEBODY GIVEN THEIR LINES CLEARLY THE REST OF US WITH OUR HEADS DOWN IN THE BOOKS WALKING THE LINE NOW THERE ARE THERE ARE PEOPLE ECAUSE THERE ARE BENCHES THAT ARE ALL THROUGHOUT THE INSIDE OF THE TRACK SO THERE ARE PEOPLE ACTUALLY WATCH US SO YOU'LL HEAR THIS OLD ENGLISH STYLE SPEECH IN ALL OH WHOLE ORATIO AND THESE PEOPLE IK O WHAT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF DOING ANY PLAY IN PRISON IS IT BEING A GOOD ACTOR IS THE EXACT EMOTIONAL OPPOSITE OF WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A SUCCESSFUL INMATE RATHER THEN CLOSE OFF ALL FEELING AND LOOKED TOUF YOU HAVE TO OPEN YOUR VULNERABLESELF UP AND WITHSTAND OFTEN CRUEL LAUGHTERS YOU TRY TO FIND SOME AUTHENTIC COMMOTION WITHIN YOU AN THIS WAY A LEVEL FOUR IGH SECURITY PRISON IS NO DIFFERENT FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND SO MOST OF THE INMATES WHO ADDITION FOR AGNES TEND TO BE YOU KNOW ACTORY PEOPLE THE THEATR TYPES OF PRIS ON BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE HE JUST HAD TO PUT UP WITH ABUSE FROM THE BIGGER MEANER IN MATES BUT THAT

WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LA PODCAS  A SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TO E I'M INDREW HUBERMEN AND I'M MY PROFESSOR OF NEROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF INTRODUCIN DOCTOR LECS FREEDMEN AS OUR GUEST ON THE HUBERMAN LAD PODCAST DOCTOR FREEDMEN IS A RESEARCHORT AN MITEE SPECIALIZING IN MACHINE LEARNING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND HUMAN ROBOT INTERACTIONS I MUST SAY THAT THE CONVERSATION WITH LECS WAS WITHOUT QUESTION ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING CONVERSATIONS THAT I HAVE EVER HAD NOT JUST IN MY CAREER BUT IN MY LIFETIME I KNEW THAT LECKS WORKED ON THESE TOPICS AND I THINK MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH LECS AND HIS INTEREST IN THESE TOPICS FROM HIS INCREDIBLE PODCAST THE LECS FREEDMEN PODCAST YOU'RE NOT ALREADY WATCHING THAT PODCAST PLEESE SUBSCRIBE TO IT IS ABSOLUTELY FANCASTIC BUT IN HOLDING THIS CONVERSATION WITH LECS I REALIZED SOMETHING FAR MORE IMPORTANT HE REVEAL TO US A BIT OF HIS DREAM HIS DREAM ABOUT HUMANS AND ROBOTS ABOUT HUMANS AND MACHINS AND ABOUT HOW THOSE INTERACTIONS CAN CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE PERCEIVE OURSELVES AND THAT WE INTERACT WITH THE WORLD WE DISCUSS RELATIONSHIPS OF ALL KINDS RELATIONSHIPS WITH ANIMALS RELATIONSHIPS WITH FRIENDS RELATIONSHIPS WITH FAMILY AND ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS AND WE DISCUSS RELATIONSHIPS WITH MACHINES MACHINES THAT MOVE AND MACHINES THAT DON'T MOVE AND MACHINES THAT COME TO UNDERSTAND US IN WAYS THAT WE COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND FOR OURSELVES AND HOW THOSE MACHINES CAN EDUCATE US ABOUT OURSELVES BEFORE THIS CONVERSATION I HAD NO CONCEPT OF THE WAYS IN WHICH MACHINES COULD INFORM ME OR ANY ONE ABOUT THEMSELVES BY THE END I WAS ABSOLUTELY TAKEN WITH THE IDEA AND I'M STILL TAKEN WITH THE IDEA THAT INTERACTIONS WITH MACHINES OF A VERY PARTICULAR KIND A KIND THAT LECS UNDERSTANDS AND WANTS TO BRING TO THE WORLD CAN NOT ONLY TRANSFORM THE SELTH BUT MAY VERY WELL TRANSFORM HUMANITY SO WHETHER OR NOT YOUR FAMILIAR WITH DOCTOR LECS FREEDMEN OR NOT I'M CERTAIN YOU ARE GOING TO LEARN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT FROM HIM DURING THE COURSE OF OUR DISCUSSION AND THAT IT WILL TRANSFORM THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT YOURSELF AND ABOUT THE WORLD BEFORE WE BEGIN I WANT TO MENTION THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THENE I'D LIKE THE THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AN TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THERE EASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THREASEN I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRITIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH ARE VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GUP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS AND W HICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS I GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBICS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIO IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ATLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'L GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENSIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIENT INVITEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETI GREEN STOCK ALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIVFRE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOS OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENTS AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AV TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLYTES FOR NERVE SELF FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIA MAGNESIUM AN POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IFHYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOS OF ELECTROLITES IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN ND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WIH YOUR PURCHASTS THEI'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT DOK CLM SLASH HUBERMEN AND NOW MY CONVERSATION WITH DOCTOR LECKS FREEDMEN WE MEET AGAIN WE MEET AGAIN THANK SO MUCH FOR SITTING DOWN WITH ME I HAVE A QUESTION THAT I THINK IS ON A LOT OF PEOPLE'S MINDS OR OUGHT TO BE ON A LOT OF PEOPLE'S MINDS BECAUSE WE HEAR THESE TERMS A LOT THESE DAYS BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE INCLUDING MOST SCIENTISTS AND INCLUDING ME DON'T KNOW REALLY WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM THINGS LIKE MACHINE LEARNING AND ROBODICS SO IF YOU WOULD BE SO KIND AS TO EXPLAIN TO US WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND WHAT IS MACHINE LEARNIN WELL I THINK THAT QUESTION IS AS COMPLICATED AND AS FASCINATING AS THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS INTELLIGENCE SO I THINK OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FIRST AS A BIG PHILOSOPHICAL THING PPAMAMOCORTIC SAID HE A AY WAS E A Y WAS THE ANCIENT WISH TO FORGE TO GODS OR IS BORN AS THE ANCIENT WISH TO FORGE THO GODS SO I THINK AT THE BIG PHILOSOPHICAL LEVEL IT'S OR LONGING TO CREATE OTHER INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS PERHAPS SYSTEMS MORE POWERFUL THAN US AT THE MORE NARROW LEVEL I THINK IT'S ALSO A SET OF TOOLS THET A COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICAL TOOLS TO AUTIMATE DIFFERENT TASKS AND THEN ALSO IT'S OUR ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND OUR OWN MIND SO BUILD SYSTEMS THAT EXHIBITS SOME INTELLIGENT BEHAVIOR IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS INTELLIGENCE IN OUR OWN SELVES SO ALL THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE OF COURSE WHAT A AY REALLY MEANS AS A COMMUNITY AS A SUT OF RESEARCHERS AND ENGINEARS IT'S A SET OF TOOLS A SET OF A COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUES THAT ALLOW YOU TO SOLVE VARIOUS PROBLEMS THE THERE'S A LONG HISTORY THAT TE APPROACHES THE PROBLEM FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES WHAT'S A ALWAYS BEEN THROUGHOUT ONE OF THE THREADS ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES GOES UNDER THE FLAG OF MACHINE LEARNING WHICH IS EMPHASIZING IN THE A AY SPACE THE THE TASK OF LEARNING HOW DO YOU MAKE A MACHINE THAT KNOWS VERY LITTLE IN THE BEGINNING FALLO SOME KIND OF PROCESS AND LEARNS TO BECOME BETTER AND BETTER IN A PARTICULAR TASK WHAT'S BEEN MOST A VERY EFFECTIVE IN THE RECENT ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS IS A SUC OF TECHNIQUES THAT FALL UNDER THE FLAG OF DEEP LEARNING THEY UTILIZED NEARAL NUTWORKS WHEN YOURL NUTWORKS ARE AT THESE A FASCINATING THINGS INSPIRED BY THE STRUCTURE OF THE HUMAN BRAIN A VERY LOOSELY BUT THEY HAVE A IT'S A NUTWORK OF THESE LITTLE BASIC COMPETITION IN UNITS CALLED NURONS ARTIFICIAL NURONS AND THEY HAVE E THESE ARCHITECTURES HAVEIN IMPUT AND OUTPUT THEY KNOW NOTHING IN THE BEGINNING IN THEIR TASK WITH LEARNING SOMETHING INTERESTING WHAT THAT SOMETHING INTRESTING IS USUALLY INVOLVES A PARTICULAR TASK THE THERE'S LOT OF WAYS TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND BREAK THIS DOWN LIKE ONE OF THEM IS HOW MUCH HUMAN SUPERVISION IS REQUIRED TO TEACH THIS THING SO SUPERVIZE LEARNING THIS BROAD CATEGORY IS A THE THENOURAL NUTWORK KNOWS NOTHING IN THE BEGINNING AND THEN IT'S GIVEN A BUNCH OF EXAMPLES OF E INCOMPUTIVISION THAT WOULD BE EXAMPLES OF CADS DOGS CARS TRAFFIC SIGNS AND THEN YOU GIVEN THE IMAGE AND YOU GIVEN THE GROUND TRUTH OF WHAT'S IN THAT IMAGE AND WHEN YOU GET A LARGE DATA BASE OF SUCH IMAGE EXAMPLES WHERE YOU KNOW THE TRUTH THE A THENOURAL NUTWORK IS ABLE TO LEARN BY EXAMPLE AS CALLED SUPERVISED LEARNING THE QUEST THERE'S A LOT OF FASTEN ANY QUESTIONS WITHIN THAT WHICH IS HOW DO YOU PROVIDE THE TRUTH WHEN YOU GIVEN AN IMAGE OF A CAT HOW DO YOU PROVIDE TO THE COMPUTER THAT THIS IMAGE CONTAINS A CAT DO YOU JUST SAY THE ENTIRE IMAGEIS A PICTURE OF A CAT DO YOU DO WHAT'S VERY COMMONLY BEEN DONE WHICH IS A BOUNDING BOX YOU HAVE A VERY CRUDE BOX AROUND THE CAT'S FACE SAYING THIS IS A CAT DO YOU DO SYMMNTIC SAGMENTATION MIND YOU THIS IS A TWODY IMAGE OF A CAT SO IT'S NOT A THE COMPUTER KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT OUR THREE DIMENTIONAL WORLD IS JUST LOOKING AT A SET OF PIXLES SO A SYMMENTIC SAGMENTATION IS DRAWING AN NICE VERY CRISP OUTLINE AROUND THE CAT AND SAYING THAT'S A CAT THAT REALLY DIFFICULT TOUPERVIDE THAT TRUTH AND THE ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL OPEN QUESTIONS IN COMPUTI VISION IS IS THAT EVEN A GOOD REPRESENTATION OF THE TRUTH NOW THERE IS ANOTHER CONTRASTING SED OF IDEAS THEIR ATTENTION THERE OVERLAPPING IS A WHAT'S USE TO BE CALLED UNSUPERVISED LEARNING WHAT'S COMMONLY NOW CALLED SELF SUPERVISED LEARNING WHICH IS TRYING TO GET LESS AND LESS AND LESS HUMAN SUPERVISION INTO THE INTO A INTO THE CASK SO SELF SUPERVISED LEARNING IS A MORE IS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN THE DOMAIN OF OU LANGUAGE MODEL NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND NOW MORE OR MORSE BEING SUCCESSFUL IN COMPUTEO VISION TASK AND WHAT'S THE IDEA THERE IS LET THE MACHINE WITHOUT ANY GROUND TRUTH ANITATION JUST LOOK AT PICTURES ON THE INTRINETE OR LOOK AT TEXT ON THE INTRINETE AND TRY TO LEARN SOMETHING A GENERAL LIZABLE ABOUT THE IDEAS THAT ARE AT THE CORE OF LANGUAGE OR AT THE CORE OF VISION AND BASED ON THAT WE HUMANS AT IT'S BEST LIKE TO CALL THAT COMMON SENSE SO WITH IS WHO HAVE THIS GIANT BASE OF KNOWLEDGE ON TOP OF WHICH WE BUILDS MORE SOPHISTICATED KNOWLEDGE WHET OF THIS KIND OF COMMON SENSE KNOWLEDGE AND SO THE IDEA OF SELF SUPERVISED LEARNING IS TO BUILD THIS COMMON SENSE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT ARE THE FUNDAMENTAL VISUAL IDEAS THAT MAKE UP A CAT AND A DOG AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WITHOUT EVER HAVING HUMAN SUPERVISION THE TE DREAM THERE IS THE YOUS YOU JUST LET AN A I SYSTEM THAT'S A SELF SUPERVISED RUN AROUND THE INTINETE FOR A WHILE WATCH OU TO VIDIOS FOR MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF OURS AND WITHOUT ANY SUPERVISION BE CRIMED AND READY TO ACTUALLY LEARN WITH VERY FEW EXAMPLES ONCE THE HUMAN IS ABLE TO SHOW UP TWE THINK OF A CHILDREN IN THIS WAY HUMAN CHILDREN IS YOUR PARENTS ONLY GIVE ONE OR TWO EXAMPLES TO TEACH A CONCEPT THE THE DREAM OF SELF SUPERVISED LEARNING IS THAT WOULD BE THE SAME WITH WITH O MACHINES THAT THEY WOULD O WATCH MILLIONS OF HOURS OF A EU TO VIDIOS AND THEN COME TO A HUMAN AND BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHEN THE HUMAN SHOWS THEM THIS IS A CAT HA REMEMBER THIS TA CAT THEY WILL UNDERSTAND THAT A CAT IS NOT  JUST THA THING WITH POINTO EARS OR A CAT CAT IS A THING THAT'S ORANGE OR ITS FURRY THAT THEY'LL SEE SOMETHING MORE FUNDAMENTAL THAT WE HUMANS MIGHT NOT ACTULLY BE ABLE TO INTEROSPECT AND UNDERSTAND L IF I ASKED YOU WHAT MAKES A CAT OR IS A DOG YOU WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT BUT IF I SHOWED YOU BROUGHT T YOU A CAT AND A DOG YOUOULD BE ABLE TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE WHAT ARE THE IDEAS THAT YOUR BRAIN USES TO MAKE THAT DIFFERENCE  THAT'S THE WHOLE DREAM WITH SELF SUPERVISED LEARNING IS THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO LEARN THAT ON ITS OWN THAT SET OF COMMON SENSE KNOWLEDGE THAT'S ABLE TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE AND THEN THERE IS LIKE A LOT OF INCREDIBLE USES OF SELF SUPERVISE LEARNING A VERY WEIRDLY CALLED SELF PLAY MECHANISM THAT'S THE MECHANISM BEHIND THE A THE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING SUCCESSESS OF A THE SYSTEMS THAT WANTET TA GO AT A ALPHAZERO A THAT WANT A CHEST WHAT OH I SEE THAT PLAY GAMES THAT PLAY GAMES DOT IT SO THE IDEA OF SELF PLAY IS PROBABLY APPLIES A TO OTHER DOMAYS THAN JUST GAMES IS A SYSTEM THAT JUST PLAYS AGAINST ITSELF AND THIS IS FASCINING IN ALL KINDS OF DOMAINS BUT A IT KNOWS NOTHING IN THE BEGINNING AND THE WHOLE IDEA IS IT CREATES A MUCH OF MUTATIONS OF ITSELF AND PLAYS AGAINST THOSE A VERSIONS OF ITSELF AND THE FASCINING THING IS WHEN YOU PLAY GAINST SYSTEMS THAT ARE LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN YOU YOU START TO GET BETTER YOURSELF LIKE THE LEARNING THAT'S HOW YOU LEARNING HAPPENS THAT'S TRUE FROM MARSHAL ARSTAT THA TRUE AND A LOT OF CASES WHERE YOU WANT TO BE INTERACTING WITH WITH THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE JUST A LITTLE BETTER THAN YOU AND THEN THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF INTERACTING WITH SYSTEMS JUST A LITTLE BETTER THAN YOU YOU START FALLOWING THIS PROCESS WHERE EVERYBODY STAS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER UNTIL YOU ARE SEVERAL ORDERS AN MAGNATYOU BETTER THAN THE WORLD CHAMPION IN CHEST FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS FASCINING CONSISTIT AVE RUN AWAY SYSTEM ONE OF THE MOST TERRIFYING AND EXCITING THINGS THAT A DAVID SILVER THE CREATOR OF ALFOLGONE ALPAZERO ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE TEAM SAID A TO ME IS A THEY HAVEN'T FOUND THE CEILING FOR ALPHAZERO MEANING YOU COULD JUST ARBITRARILY KEEP IMPROVING NOT IN THE REALM OF CHESS THAT DOESN'T MATTER TO US THAT IS LIKE IT JUST RAN AWAY WITH THE GAME OF CHEST LIKE GITS SLIKE JUST SO MUCH BETTER THAN HUMANCE BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT IF YOU CAN CREATE THAT IN THE REALM THAT DOES HAVE A A BIGGER DEEPER EFFECT ON HUMAN BEINGS ON SOCIETIES AH THAT COUND BE A TERRIFYING PROCESS TO ME IS AN EXCITING PROCESS IF YOU SUPERVISE IT CORRECTLY IF YOU INJECT A IF A WHAT'S CALLED  VALUAL LIMENT YOULA YOU MAKE SURE THAT THE GOALS THAT THE AIYS ALPTIMIZING IS ALINED WITH HUMAN BEINGS AN HUMAN SOCIETIES THERE IS A LOT OF FASCINING THINGS THE TALK ABOUT WITHIN THE  SPECIFICS OF NERAL NOW WORKS AND ALL ALL THE PROMS OT PEOPLE ARE ARE WORKING ON BUT I WOULD SAY THE REALLY BIG EXCITING ONE IS SELF SUPERVISED LEARNING WH ERE TRYING TO GET LESS UNLESS HUMAN SUPERVISION A THE LESS AND LESS HUMAN SUSUPERVISION OF NEARL NETWORKS AN ALSO JUST THE COMMENT AND ALL SHUT UP NOW PLEASE KEEP GOING O I'M LEARNING I HAVE QUESTIONS BUT I'M LEARNING WIR PLEASE KEEP YOU SO THAT TO ME WHAT'S EXCITING IS NOT THE THEORY I'S ALWAYS THE APPLICATION ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SPECIFICALLY IN YOU ILL NOT WORKSOME ASSHE LEARNING IS TESTLE AUTOPOLET SO THESE ARE SYSTEMS THAT ARE WORKING IN THE REAL WORLD THIS ISN'T AN ECADAMIC EXERCISE THIS IS HUMAN LIVES AT STAKE THIS A SAFETY CRITICAL A IS MY AUTOMATED VEHICLES OT OTOATORNOMIST SEMYATONOMIS WIT GOING TO BE WE WE'VE GONE THROUGH WARS ON THESE TOPICS EMY AONOMIS THE SEMYATIME SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S CALLED THE AFFES TE FULL SELF DRIVING IT IS CURNENLLY NOT FULLYATONOMOS MEANING HUMAN SUPERVISION IS REQUIRED SO HUMAN IS TASKED WITH OVERSEEING THE SYSTEMS IN FACT LIABILITYWISE THE HUMAN IS ALWAYS RESPONSIBLE THIS IS A HUMAN FACTOR PSYCHOLOGY QUESTION WHICH IS FASCINATING I'M FASCINATED BY THE THE WHOLE SPACE WHICH IS E WHOLE ANOTHER SPACE OF HUMAN ROBAD INTERACTION WHEN A I SYSTEMS AND HUMANS WORK TOGETHER TO ACCOMPLISHED TASK THAT DANCE TO ME IS A IS ONE OF THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES BUT I THINK IT WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OPEN PROBLEMS ONCE TURSOLVED IS HOW TO HUMANS IN ROBADS DANCE TOGETHER TO ME SEMYATON AS DRIVING IS ONE OF THOSE SPACES SO FOR A FOR EELON FOR EXAMPLE HE DOESN'T SEE IT THAT WAY HE SEES OF SEMYATONMAS DRIVING AS A STEPPING STONE TOLWAYS FULLYATONOMAS DRIVING LIKE HUMANS AND ROBATS CAN'T DANCE WELL TOGETHER LIKE HUMANS A HUMANS DANCE AND ROBATS AND ROBAS DANCE LIKE WE NEED TO THIS AN ENGINEERING PROBLEM WHEN HE TO DESIGN A PERFECT ROBAT THAT SALLS IS PROBLEM TO ME FOREVER MAY BE THIS NOT THE CASE WOR DRIVING BUT THE WORLD IS GOING TO BE FULL OF PROBLEMS WHERE ITS ALWAYS HUMANS AND ROBATS HAVE TO INTERACT BECAUSE I THINK ROBATS WILL ALWAYS BE FLAUD JUST LIKE HUMANS ARE GOING TO BE FLAUD AR FLAUD AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES LIKE BEAUTIFUL THAT THE'RE FLAUD THAT'S WORE LEARNING HAPPENS AT THE EDGE OF EUR CAPABILITIES SO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW CAN FLOUD ROBATS IN FLOD HUMANS INTERACT TOGETHER SUCH THAT THEY ARE LIKE THE THE SOM IS BIGGER THAN THE WHOLE AS UPPOSED TO FOCUSSING IN JUST BUILDING THE PERFECT ROBA SO THE SO THATS ONE OR MOST EXCITING APPLICATIONS I WOULD SAY OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO ME IS TA TONMAS DRIVING AND SEMYATOMAS DRIVING AND THAT'S A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF MACHINE LEARNING BECAUSE THOSE SYSTEMS ARE CONSTANTLY LEARNING AND TE THERE'S THERE'S A PROCESS THERE THAT MAY BE ICON COM WENT ON THE HOTER CAPATHY WHO'S THE HEAD OF AUTOPOLIT CALLS IT THE DATA ENGINE AND THT THIS PROCESS APPLIES FOR A LOT OF MACHINE LEARNING WHICH IS YOU BUILD A SYSTEM THIS PRETTY GOOD AT DOING STUFF YOU SENDING YOU SEND IT OUT INTO THE REAL WORLD IT' STARTS DOING THE STUFF AND THEN RUNS INTO WHAT ARE CALLED EDGE CASES LIKE FAILURE CASES WHEREIT SCREWS UP YOU KNOW WE DO THIS AS KIDS THAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU HAVE THIS IS ADULT FE IS IS A DULTS EXACTLY BUT WE LEARN REALLY QUICKLY BUT THE WHOLE POINT D THIS IS THE FASCINANTHING ABOUT DRIVING IS YOU REALIZE THEREIS MILLIONS OF EDE CASES ATHERE'S JUST LIKE WEIRD SITUATIONS THAT YOU DID NOT EXPECT AND SO THE DATA ENGINE PROCESSIS YOU COLLECT THOSE EDGE CASES AND THEY GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND LEARN FROM THEM AS YOU HAVE TO CREATE THIS DATE A PIPE LINE WHERE ALL THESE CARS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANS AF CARS A ARE DRIVING AROUND AND SOMETHING WEIRD HAPPENS AND SO WHENEVER THIS WEIRD DETECT IV FIRES IT'S ANOTHER IMPORTANT CONCEPT HAT YOU THAT PIECE OF DATA GOES BACK A TO THE MOTHER SHIP FOR THE FOR THE TRAINING FOR THE RETRAINING OF THE SYSTEM AND THROUGH THIS DATA ENGINE PROCESS IT KEEPS IMPROVING AND GETTING BETTER AND BETTER AD BETTER AND BETTER SOBASICALLY YOU SEND OUT A PRETTY CLEVER AI SYSTEMS OUT INTO THE WORLD AND LET IT FIND THE EDGECASES LET IT CREW UP JUST ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE EGE CASES ARE AND THEN GO BACK AND LEARN FROM THEM AND THEN SEND OUT THAT NEW VERSION AND KEEP UP DATING THAT VERSION IS THE UP DATING DONE BY HUMANS THE ANITATION IS DONE BY HUMANS THE SO YOAVE TE THE WEIRD EXAMPLES COME BACK THE EDGECASES AND YOU HAVE TO LABEL WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN THERE THERE'S ALSO SOME MECHANISMS FOR AUTOMATIC AUTOMATICALLY LABELING BUT MOSTLY I THINK YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO RELY ON HUMANS TO IMPROVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WEIRD WEIR CASES AND THEN THERE'S A LOT O DEBATE AD THITS THE OTHER THING WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WHICH IS A BUNCH OS SMART PEOPLE HAVING VERY DIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT WHAT IS INTELLIGENCE SO A A IS BASELY A COMMUTY OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T AGRAN ANYTHING IT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE IM YOU KNOW AND FIRST OF ALL THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL DESCRIPTION OF TERMS THAT I 'VE HEARD MANY TIMES AMONG MY COLLEAGUES AT STAMFORD AT MEETINGS IN T IN THE OUT SIDE WORLD AND AM THERE'S SO MANY FASCINATING THINGS I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONE BUT I DO ON TO ASK ONE QUESTION ABOUT THE CULTURE OF A A BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM TO BE A COMMUNITY WHERE LEAST IS AN OUTSIDER WHICH SEEMS LIKE THERE'S VERY LITTLE CONSENTUS ABOUT WHAT THE TERMS AN THE OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS EVEN MEAN OM AND THRE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF SPLITTING HAPPENING NOW IF NOT JUST SUPERVISED AND INSUR SUPERVISED LEARNING BUT THESE SORT OF A INTERMEDIATE O CONDITIONS WHERE MACHINES ARE AUTONOMOUS BUT THEN GO BACK FOR MORE INSTRUCTION LIKE KIDS GO HOME FROM COLLEGE DURING THE SUMMER AND GET AL OUN A MOM STILL FEEDS THEM THAN EVENTUALLY THEY LEAVE THE THE NEST KIND OF THING OM I IS THERE SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR ABOUT ENGINEERS WERE ABOUT PEOPLE IN THIS A REALM OF ENGINEERING THAT YOU THINK LENDS ITSELF TO DISAGREEMENT YET I THINK A SO SO FOR SAS THE MORE SPECIFIC YOU GET THE LESS DISAGREEMENT THERE IS SO THERE'S A LOT OF DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WHAT IS ARTIFICINAL INTELLIGENCE BUT THERE'S LESS DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WHAT IS MACHINE LEARNING AND EVEN LESS WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT ACT IVE LEARNING OR MACHINE TEACHING OR A SELF SUPERFIZED LEARNING AND THEN WHEN YOU GET IN TO LIKE AND I'LL BE LANGUAGE MODELS OR TRANSFORMERS WHEN YOU GET INTO PECIFIC NER NETWORK ARCHITECTURES THERE'S LESS AND LESS AND LESS THISAGREEMENT ABOUT THOSE TERMS SO YOU MIGHT BE HERE IN THE DISAGREEMENT FROM THE HIGH LEVEL TERMS AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT ENGINEERING ESPECIALLY WHEN YOURE TALKING ABOUT INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IS IS A A LITTLE BIT OF AN ART AND A SCIENCE SO THE ARD PART IS A IS THE THING THAT CREATES DISAGREEMENTS BECAUSE THEN YOU START HAVING THISAGREEMENTS ABOUT TH HOW EASY OR DIFFICULT TO PARTICULAR PROBLEMS FOR EXAMPLE LOT OF PEOPLE THISAGREED WITH ELON HOW DIFFICULT THE PROBLEM OF A TOM'S DRIVING IS AND AND SO BUT NOBODY KNOWS SO THERES A LOT OF DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WHAT ARE THE LIMITS OF THESE TECHNIQUES AND THROUGH THAT THE TERMINOLODGY ALSO CONTAINS WITHIN IT THE A THA DISAGREEMENTS BUT OVER ALL I THINK IT'S ALSO YOUNG SCIENCE THAT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH THAT SA LIKE IT'S NOT JUST ENGINEERING IT'S THAT ARTIFICIONAL TELLIGENCE TRULY AS A LARGE SKILLED DISIPLINE WHERE ITS THOUSANDS TENS OF THOUSANDS CONJURES OF THOUSANDS PEOPLE WORKING ON AT HUGE AMONS OF MONEY BEING MADE THATS A VERY RECENT THING SO WOULD TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THOSE TERMS AND OF COURSE THIS EGOES IN PERSONALITIES AND A LOT OF FAME TO BE MADE A YOU KNOW LIKE THE THE TERM DEEP LEARNING FOR EXAMPLE NERL NETWORKS HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR MANY MANY DECADES SINC THE SIXTIES YOU CAN ARGUUE SINCE THE FORTIES SO THERE WAS A REBRANDING OF NOUR NETWORKS INTO THE WORD DEEP LEARNING TERM DEEP LEARNING THAT WAS PART OF THE REINFIGORATION OF THE FIELD BUT'S REALLY THE SAME EXACT THING I DIDN'T KNOW THAT A MAN NI GREW UP IN THE AGE OF NARROW SCIENCE WHEN NARRL NETWORKS A WERE DISCUSE A COMPUTATIONAL NAROW SCIENCE AND THEORETICAL NOR SCIENCE THEY HAD THEIR OWN JOURNALS T IT WASN'T ACTUALLY TAKEN TERRIBLY SERIOUSLY BY EXPERIMENTALIS UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO I WUT SE ABOUT FIVE TO SEVENTY YEARS AGO A EXCELLENT THEORETICAL NARROW SCIENTISTS LIKE LARRYABBID AND M OTHER A I'VE COLLIGS CERTAINLY IT STAMFORD AS WELL THUT PEOPLE START PAYING ATTENTION TO COMPUTATIONAL METHODS BUT THESE TERMS NARAL NETWORKS COMPUTATIONAL METHODS I ACTUALLY DIDN'T KNOW THAT NARRAL NECK WERE WORKS IN DEEP LEARNING WERE A THERE WAS AVE NOW BECOME CON OF SONONICCAS THEY WERE ALWAYS WHAT NOW THEY 'RE ALWAYS THE SAME THING INTEREST IT WAS A SO LEMMIN NERRO SCIENTIST AND I DIDN'T KNOW SO WELL BECAUSE NOU NOTWORS PROBABLY MEANS SOMETHING ELSE IN YOUR SIENCE NOT SOMETHIN NG ELSE BUT A LITTLE DIFFERENT FLAVOR DEPENDING ON THE FIELD AND THT'S FASSAYING TO BECAUSE NOUR SCIENCE AND A I PEOPLE HAVE STARTED A WORKING TOGETHER IN DANCING A LOT MORE A IN THE RECENT I'LL SAY PROBABLY DECADE O MACHINES ARE GOING INTO THE BRAIN AM I I'VE A COUPLE QUESTIONS BUT ONE THING THAT I'M  SORT OF FIXATED ON THAT I FIND INCREDIBLY INTERESTING IS THIS EXAMPLE A YOU GAVE OF PLAYING A GAME WITH A MUTATED VERSION OF YOURSELF AS A COMPETITOR YI FIND THAT INCREDIBLY INTERESTING AS A KIND OF A PARALLEL OR A MIRROR FOR WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE TRY AND LEARN AS HUMANS WHICH IS WE GENERATE REPETITIONS OF WHATEVER IT IS WE'RE TRYING TO LEARN AND WE MAKE ERRORS OCCASIONALLY WE SUCCEED IM IN A SIMPLE EXAMPLE FOR INSTANCE OF TRYING TO THROW BULL'S EYES ON A DARTBOARD I MAN HAVE ERRORS ERRORS ERRORS ALMISS THE DARTBOARD AND MAYBE OCCASIONALLY HIT A BULLS I AND I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I JUST DID RIGHT BUT THEN LET'S SAY I WAS PLAYING DARTS AGAINST DIVERSION OF MYSELF WERE MY I WAS WEARING A VISUAL PRISM LIKE MY VISUAL I HAD A VISUAL DEFECT YOU LEARN CERTAIN THINGS IN THAT MODE AS WELL YOU'RE SAYING THAT A MACHINE CAN SORT OF MUTATE ITSELF DOES THE MUTATION ALWAYS CAUSE A DEFICIENCY THAT IT NEEDS TO OVERCOME BECAUSE MUTATIONS AND BIOLOGY SOMETIMES GIVE US SUPERPOWERS RIHTE OCCASIONALLY YOU'LL GET SOMEBODY WHO HAS BETTER THAN TWENTY TWENTY VISION AND THEY CAN SEE BETTER THAN NINETY NINE POINT NINE PRESENT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A MACHINE PLAYING A GAME AGAINST A MUTATED VERSION OF ITSELF IS THE MUTATION ALWAYS AT WHAT WE CALL A NEGATIVE MUTATION OR A A AN ADAPTEDE OR A MALADAPT OF MUTATION NO YE YOU DON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU GET YA SMUTATE FIRST AN THE FIGURE OUT IN THEY COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER SO YOU'RE EVOLVING YOUR THE MACHINE GETS TO EVOLVE ITSELF IN REAL TIME YET AND I I THINK OF IT WHICH WOULD BE EXCITING YOU COULACTLLY DO WITH HUMANS IT'S NOT JUST SO USUALLY YOU FREEZE AVERSION OF THE SYSTEM SO REALLY YOU TAKE ANA ANDREW OF YESTERDAY AND YOU MAKE TEN CLONES OF THEM AND THEN MAY BE YOU MUTATE MAY BE NOT AND THEN YOU DO A BUNCH OF COMPETITIONS OF THE ANDREW OF TO DAY LIKE YOU FIGHT TO THE DEATH WHO WINS LATH SI LOVE THAT IDEA OF LIKE CREATING A BUNCH OF CLONES OF MYSELF FROM LIKE FROM EACH OF THE DAY FOR THE PAST YEAR AND JUST SEEING WHOIS GOING TO BE BETTER AT LIKE POD CASTING OR SCIENCE OR PICKING UP CHECKS AT A BAR ORA ADONO OR COMPETING INTO GETZSU THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT ANDING A LOT OF LEXAS WOULD HAVE TO DIE FOR THAT PROCESS BUT THAT'S THE SENSIAL WHAT HAPPENS IS IN RING FOR SOME LEARNING THROUGH THE SELF PLAY MECHANISMS IT'S THE GRAVE YARD OF SYSTEMS THAT DIDN'T DO THAT WELL AND THE THE THE SURVIVING TTHE THE GOOD ONES SURVIVE DO YOU THINK THAT A DARWIN'S THEORY OF EVOLUTION I MIGHT HAVE WORKED IN SOME SENSE IN THIS WAY BUT AT THE POPULATION LEVEL I MYU GET A BUNCH OF BIRD WO DIFFERENT SHAPE BEAKS AND SOME IRDS HAVE THE SHAPE BEK THAT ALLOWS THEM TO GET THE SEEDS AN IS TRIVIAL TRIVIALLY SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF DARWINI AN EVOLUTION BUT I THINK IT  IT'S IT'S CORRECTIVE NOT A EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT EXHAUSTIVE IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO YOU ESSENTIALY THAT NORMALLY THIS IS DONE BETWEEN MEMBERS OF A DIFFERENT SPECIES LOTS OF DIFFERENT MEMBERS A SPECIES OF DIFFERENT TRAITS AND SOME GET SELECTED FOR BUT YOU COULD ACTUALLY CREATE MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF YOURSELF WITH DIFFERENT TRAITS SO WITH I SHOULDPROBABLY HAVE SAID THIS BUT A PERHAPS IT'S IMPLIED WITH MACHINE LEARNING OF REINFORCEMENT LEARNING THROUGH THESE PROCESSIES ONE OF THE BIG REQUIREMENTS ITS TO HAVE AN OBJECTIVE FUNCTION A LOSS FUNCTION A YOUTILITY FUNCTION THERES ARE ALL DIFFERENT TERMS FOR THE SAME THING IS THERE'S A TIK ANYQUATION THAT SAYS WHAT'S GOOD AND AND THEN YOU'E TRYING TO OPTIMIZE THAT EQUATION SO THERE'S A CLEAR GOAL FOR THESE SYSTEMS LI BECAUSES IT'S A GAME LIKE WHAT CHASTER'S IT THERE'S A GOAL BUT FOR ANYTHING ANYTHING YOU WANT MACHINE LEANING TO SOLVE THERE NEEDS TO BE AN OBJECTIVE FUNCTION I MACHINE LEARNING AS YOU SHOULD CALL LOST FUNCTION THAT YOU'RE OPTIMIZING THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT EVOLUTION COMPLICATE OF COURSE BUT THE GOAL ALSO SEEMS TO BE EVOLVING LIKE IT'S A I GUESS ADAPTATION TO THE ENVIRONMENT IS THE GOAL BUT IT'S UNCLEAR YOU CAN CONVERT THAT ALWAYS IT'S A LIKE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST IT'S ON CLEAR WHAT THE FITTEST IS IN MACHINE LEARNING THE STARTING POINT AND THIS IS LIKE WHAT HUMAN INGENUITY PROVIDES IS THAT FITNESS FUNCTION OF WHAT'S GOOD WHAT'S BAD WHICH IT IT IT LET'S YOU KNOW WHICH OF THE SYSTEMS IS GOING TO WIN SO MEAN TO HAVE A EQUATION LIKE THAT ONE OF THE FASCINING THINGS ABOUT HUMANS IS WE FIGURE OUT OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONS FOR IS LIKE WERE A IT'S THE MEANING OF LIFE LIKE WHY THE HELLOR WE HERE AND A A MACHINE CURRENTLY HAS TO HAVE A HARD COTED STATEMENT ABOUT WHY YOU HAST TO HAVE A MEANING OF YET ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BASE LIFE I IT CAN'T SO IKE THERE'S A LOT OF INTERESTING EXPLORATIONS ABOUT A THAT  FUNCTION BEING MORE ABOUT CURIOSITY ABOUT LEARNING YOU THINGS AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF BUT IT'S STILL HARD COTED IF YOU WANT A MACHINE TO BE ABLE TO BE GOOD AT STUFF IT HAS TO BE GIVEN VERY CLEAR STATEMENTS OF WHAT GOOD AT STUFF MEANS THAT'S ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS YOU HAVE TO FORMALIZE THA IN ORDER TO SOLVE A PROB YOUHAVE TO FORMALIZE IT AND YOUHAVE TO PROVIDE A BOTH LIKE THE FULL CENSORY INFORMATION YOUAVE TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IS THE DATE OF THIS BEING COLLECTED AND YOU AVE TO ALSO BE CLEAR ABOUT THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION WHAT IS THE GOAL THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO REACH AND THAT'S A VERY DIFFICULT THING FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE I LOVE THE YIMENTION CURIOSITY O I I'M SURE THIS DEFINITION FALL SHORT IN MANY WAYS BUT I DOFIND CURIOSITY AS A A STRONG INTEREST IN KNOWING SOMETHING BUT WITHOUT AN ATTACHMENT TO THE OUTCOME YOU KNOW IT'S SORT OF A  IT'S NOT IT COULD BE A RANDOM SEARCH BUT IT THERE'S NOT REALLY AN EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT IT'S REALLY JUST A DESIRE TO DISCOVER AN UNVEIL WHAT'S THERE WITHOUT HOPING IT'S A YOU KNOW A GOLD COIN UNDER ROCK YOU'RE JUST LOOKING UNDER ROCKS IS THAT MORE OR LESS HOW THE MACHIYOU KNOW WITHIN MACHINE LEARNING IT SOUNDS LIKE THEIR ELEMENTS OF REWARD PREDICTION AND YOU KNOW REWARDS THE MACHINE HAS TO KNOW WHEN IT'S DONE THE RIGHT THING SO IT CAN YOU MAKE MACHINES THAT ARE CURIOUS OR ARE THE SORTS OF MACHINES THAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING CURIOUS BY DESIGN YET A CURIOSITY IS THE KIND OF A SYMPTOM NOT TA THE GO SO WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IS A ONE OF THE BIG TRADE OFSAN REAN FOR SOME LEARNING IS THIS EXPIRATION VERSES EXPLOITATION SO WHEN YOU KNOW VERY LITTLE IT PAYS OFF TO EXPLORE A LOT EVEN SUBOPTIMAL LIKE EVEN TRAJECTORIES THAT SEEM LIKE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LEAD ANYWHERE THAT'S CALLED EXPLORATION THE SMARTER AN SMARTERN SMARTER YOU GET THE THE MORE EMPHASIS YOU PUT ON EXPLOITATION MEANING YOU A TAKE THE BEST SOLUTION YOU TAKE THE BEST PATH NOW THROUGH THAT PROCESS THE EXPIRATION CAN LOOK LIKE CURIOSITY BY US HUMANS BUT IT'S REALLY JUST TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE LOCAL OPTIM OF THE THING IS TO READY DISCOVERED IT'S IT'S FROM A I PERSPECT IV IT'S ALWAYS LOOKING TO OPTIMIZE THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION IT IT DERISE WE COULD TALK ABOUT THE SLOT MORE BUT IN TERMS OF THE TOOLS OF MACHINE LEARNING TO DAY IT DERIVES NO PLEASURE FROM JUST THE CURIOSITY OF LIKE I DON'T KNOW A DISCOVERY THATNO DOPE MEN FOR IT'S NO MAKING ME THERE'S NO REWARD SYSTEM CHEMICAL OR I GUESS ELECTRONIC REWARD SYSTEM THAT'S AD IF YOU LOOK AT MACHINE LEARNING LITERATURE AND REINFORCEMENT LEARNING LITERATURE THAT WILL USE LIKE DEMYING WEL USE TERMS LIKE DOPENMIN WERE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO USE THE HUMAN BRAING TO INSPIRED TOTALLY NEW SOLUTIONS TO THESE PROBLEMS SO THEY'LL THINK LIKE HOWTEST OPENING FUNCTION IN THE HUMAN BRAIN AND HOW CAN THAT LEAD TO MORE I INTERESTING WAYS TO DISCOVER A OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS BUT ULTIMATELY CURRENTLY THE H THERE HAS TO BE A A FORMAL OBJECTIVE FUNCTION THAT YOU COULD ARGUE THE HUMANS ALSO HAS THA SET OF OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONS WHICH TRYING TO OPTIMIZE WHEC JIS NOT ABLE TO INTROSPECT THEM WE DN'T YET WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN SEEKING AND DOING WET LIKE LEAST O FELMENBARICY SPOKEN WITH THE YNISTOGRAM I HOPE  BETTER GT RO YOU YEI HOPE YOU ACTUALLY  HAVE HER ON THE SPOCK AS A YOU TERRIFIC SO A SHE HAS A VERY A IS IT HAS TO DO WITH HOMEYOU STAY ISAY IS IT LIKE THAT ABASICALLY THERE'S A VERY DOM OBJECTIVE FUNCTION THAT THE BRAIN IS TRYING TO PTIMIZE LIKE TO KEEP LIKE BODY TEMPERATURE THE SHING LIKE THERE'S A VERY DOLEM KIND OF OPTIMIZATION FUNCTION HAPPENING AND THAT WHAT WE HUMANS DO WITH OUR FANCY CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNIVE ABILITIES AS WE TELL STORIES TO OURSELVES SO CAN HAVE NICE PODCASTS BUT REALLY IS THE BRAIN TRYING TO MAINTAIN A A JUST LIKE HEALTHY STATE I GUESS THAT THAT'S FASCINATING I I AUT ALSO SEE THE HUMAN BRAIN AND AND I HOPE ARTIFICIAL NTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AS A NOT JUST SYSTEMS THAT SOLVE PROBLEMS OR OPTIMIZEAGO BUT ALL SO STORY TELLERS I THINK THERE IS A POWER TO TELLING STORIES WE TELL STORIES TO EACH OTHER THAT'S WHAT COMMUNICATION IS LIKE WHEN YOUARE ALONE THAT'S WHEN YOU SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT THAT'S WHEN YOU MAKE SENSE O TALG ABOUT SOLVING PROMISE BUT WHEN YOU'RE COMMUNITY THE CAPABILITY TO COMMUNICATE TELL STORIES WHOLE A SHARE IDEAS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THOSE IDEAS ARE STABLE OVER A LONG PERIOD O TIME THAT'S LIKE THAT'S BEING A CARISMATIC STORY TELLER AND I THINK BOTH HUMANS ARE VERY GOOD AT THIS ARGUABLY I WOULD OW WOULD ARGUE THAT'S WHY WE ARE WHO WE ARE IS WHERE GREAT STORY TELLERS AND THEN A I I HOPE WILL ALSO BECOME THAT SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT BE ABLE TO SOLVE PROBLES WITH HA CLEAR OBJECTIVE FUNCTION IT'S THAFTERWARDS BE ABLE TO TELL LIKE A WA BU LIKE MAKE UP A WAY BETTER STORY ABOUT WHY YOU DID SOMETHING OR WHY YOU FAILED DO YOU THINK THAT A ROBOTS OR AND OR MACHINES OF OF SOME SORT ARE GOING TO START TELLING HUMAN STORIES WEL DEFINITLY SO THE TECHNICAL FIELD FOR THAT IS CALLED EXPLAINABLE MAY I EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL TELLIGENCE IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU GET THE A I SYSTEM TO EXPLAIN TO US HUMANS WHY THE HELLIT FAILED OR WHY IT SUCCEEDED OR A THERE'S A LOT O DIFFERENT SOR OVERSIONS OF THIS OR TO VISUALISE HOW IT UNDERSTANDS THE WORLD THAT'S A REALLY DIFFICULT PROBLEM ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR NO WORKS THAT ARE A FAMOUSLY OPAQUE THAT THEY WE DON'T UNDERSTAND IN MANY CASES WHY A PARTICULIN YOU OR DOES WHAT IT DOES SO WELL AND THA TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE IT'S GOING TO FAIL THAT REQUIRES THE A I TO EXPLAIN ITSELF THERE'S A HUGE AMOT O MONEY A LIKE THERE'S HUGE AMOTOMONY IN THIS ESPECIALLY FROM GOVERNMENT FINDING IT SO ON BECAUSE HUMAN A DEPLOY I A I SYSTEMS IN THE REAL WORLD WE HUMANS AT LEAST ONET OF THAT'S GET A QUESTION LIKE WHY THE HLL DID YOU DO THAT LIKE IN A DARK WAY WHY DID YOU JUST KILL THAT PERSON RIGT LIKE IF A CAR RAN OVER A PERSON WON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THAT HAPPEN AND  NO GAN WOR SOMETIMES VERY UNFAIR TO A I SYSTEMS BECAUSE WE HUMANS CAN OFTEN NOT EXPLAIN WHY VERY WELL BUT THAT'S THE FIELD OF A EXPLAINABLE AY I THAT'S VERY PEOPLE VERYTETED IN BECAUSE THE MORE OR MORE RELY A I SYSTEMS LIKE THE THE TWIDO RECOMMENDER SYSTEM THAT A I I'LL GO THEM THAT'S I WOULD SAY IMPACTING ELECTIONS PERHAPS STARTING WARS ORELEASE MILITARY CONFLICT THAT'S THAT ALLGAR THEM WE WONT TO ASK THAT ALLGAR THEM FIRST OF ALL DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE HALL YOURE DOING DO YOU KNOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE SOCIETY LEVEL AFFECTS YOUR HAVING IT CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE POSSIBLE OTHE TRAJECTORIES LIKE WE WOULD HAVE THAT CONDOF CONVERSATION WITH THE HUMAN WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WITH A NAY I AND AN MY OWN PERSONAL LEVEL I THINK IT WOULD BE NICE TO TALK TO A I SYSTEMS FOR STUPID STUFF LIKE ROBATS WHEN THEY FAIL TO A WHY DO YOU FALL DOWN THE STAIRS YET BUT I'M NOT AN ENGINEERING QUESTION BUT ALMOST LIKE A ENDEARING QUESTION LIKE LIKE I'M LOOKING FOR IF I FELL AND YOURE AND I WERE HANGING OUT I DON'T THINK YOU NEED AN EXPLANATION EXACTLY WHAT WERE THE DYNAMIC LIKE WHAT WAS THE UNDERACTUATED SYSTEM PROBLEM HERE LIKE WHAT LIKE WHAT WHAT WAS THE TEXTURE OF THE FLOOR OR SO ON OR LIKE WHAT WAS THE O ONT AN OUT O YOU'RE THINKING THAT OR YOU MIGHT JOKE ABOUT LIKE YOUR DRUNK AGAIN GO HOME OR SOMETHING LIKE THERE COULD BE HUMOR IN IT THAT THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE STORY TELLING ISN'T JUST EXPLANATION OF WHAT HAPPENED IT'S SOMETHING THAT A MAKES PEOPLE LAUGH MAKES PEOPLE FALL IN LOVE MAKES PEOPLE DREAM AND UNDERSTAND THINGS IN A WAY THAT POETRY MAKES PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THINGS AS SUPPOSED TO A RIGOROUS LOGUE OF  WHERE EVERY CENSER WAS WHERE EVERY ACTUATOR WAS MAN I FIND THIS IT INCREDIBLE BECAUSE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE HALL MARKS OF SEVERE OUTISM SPECTR DISORDERS IS IM A REPORT OF EXPERIENCE FROM THE ARTISTIC PERSON THAT IS VERY MUCH A CATALOGUE OF OF ACTION STEPS SLIKE HOW DO YOU FEEL TO DAY AND THEY'LL SAY WHI GOT UP AND I DID THIS AND THAD I DID THIS AND I DID THIS AND IT'S NOT AT ALL THE WAY THAT A A PERSON WITH WHO DOESN'T HAVATISM SPECTRUM DISORDER WOULD WOULD RESPOND AND THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE THESE MACHINES HAS SO MUCH HUMAN IAS SO MUCH HUMANISM OR SO MUCH OF OF A HUMAN AND BIOLOGICAL ELEMENT BUT I REALIZE THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MACHINES I  WON TO MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND IF THERE'S A DISTINCTION BETWEEN A MACHINE THAT LEARNS A MACHINE WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND A ROBOT AT WHAT POINT DOESM MACHINE BECOME A ROBOT SO IF I HAVE A BALL POINT PEN I'M ASSUMING I WOULDN'T CALL THAT A ROBOT BUT IF MY BALL POINT PEN IM CAN COME TO ME WHEN IT'S ON WHEN I MOVE TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE TABLE IF IT'S MOVES BY WHATEVER MECHANISM AT THAT POINT DOES IT BECOME A ROBOT OOK I THERE'S A MILLION WAYS TO EXPLORE THIS QUESTION IT'S TO FASCINATING ONE FIRST OFALL THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHAT IS LIFE LA CADI KNOWS SOMETHING IS A LIVING FORM AR NOT AND IT'S SIMILAR TO THE QUESTION OF ONE DOES SUT OFA MAY BE A COLD COMPUTATIONAL SYSTEM BECOMES A A WT WERE IDY LOADING THESE WORDS WITH A LOT EM JOYING ROBAT AND MACHINE BUT SO ONE I THINK MOVEMENT IS IS IMPORTANT BUT BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF A BORING IDEA THAT A ROBAT IS JUST THE MACHINE THAT'S ABLE TO ACT IN THE WORLD SO ONE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COULD BE BOTH JUST THE THINKING THING WHICH I THINK IS WHAT MACHINE LEARNING IS AND ALSO THE CTING THING WHICH IS WHAT WE USUALLY THINK ABOUT ROBATS SE ROBATS ARE E THINGS THAT HAVE A PERCEPTIONAL SYSTEM AS ABLE TO TAKE IN THE WORLD HOWEVER YOU DEFIND THE WORLD IS ABLE TO THINK AND LEARN AND DO WHATEVER HOW IT DOES INSIDE AND THEN ACT ON THE WORLD SO THAT'S THE DIFFERENCEACHINE MAY BE A I SYSTEM OR A MACHINE AN A ROBAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S ABLE A ROBAT IS SOMETHING IAT'S ABLE TO PERCEIVE THE WORLD AND ACT IN THE WORLD SO COULD BE THROUGH LANGUAGE OR SOUND OR CON BE THROUGH MOVEMENT OR BOTH YET AND I THINK IT COULD ALSO BE IN THE DIGUAL SPACE AS LONG AS THERE'S E ASPECT OF ENTITY THAT'S INSIDE THE MACHINE AND A WORLD THAT'S OUTSIDE THE MACHINE AND THERE'S A SENSE AN WHICH THE MACHINE IS SENSING THAT WORLD AND ACTING IN IT SO IT COULD FOR INSTANCE A THERE COULDBE AVERSION OF A ROBOT ACCORDING TO YOU THE DEFINITION THA I THINK YOU'RE PROVIDING WHERE THE ROBOT A I WHERE I GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT AND THIS ROBAT GOES AND FORAGES FOR INFORMATION THAT IT THINKS I WANT TO SEE LOADED ON TO MY DUSTOP IN THE MORNING THERE WIS NO MOVEMENT OF THAT MACHINE THERE WIS NO LANGUAGE WHAT ESSENTIALLY HAS MOVEMENT IN IN CYPRISPICE YET THERE'S A DISTINCTION THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT IN THAT THERE'S E THERE'S AE ELEMENT OF IT BEING AN ENTITY WHETHERE'S AN THE DIGIOR THE PHYSICAL SPACE SO WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE ALEXA IN YOUR HOME MOST OF THE A SPEECH RECOGNITION MOST OF WHAT ALUCTS IS DOING IS CONSTANT BEING SEND BACK TO THE MOTHER SHIP THE WHEN ELEA IS THERE ON ITS OWN THAT'S TO ME A ROBAT WHEN IT'S THERE INTERACTING WITH THE WORLD WHEN IT'S SIMPLY A FINGER OF THE MAIN MOTHER SHIP THAT'S NOT THEN THE LEX IS NOT A ROBAT THAN IT'S JUST AN INTERACTION DEVICE THAT THEN MAY BE THE MAIN AMAZON ELEXA A I BIG BIG SYSTEM IS THE ROBA SO THE THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE'S SOME ELEMENT TO US HUMANS I THINK WHERE WE WANT THERE TO BE AN ENTITY WHETHER IN THE DIGI OR THE PHYSICAL SPACE THAT'S WHERE IDEAS OF CONSCIOUSNESS COME IN AND O ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE PROJECT OUR UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A BEING AND SO TO TAKE THAT FURTHER WHEN DOES A MACHINE BECOME A ROBAT I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A SPECIAL MOMENT THERE'S A SPECIAL MOMENT IN A PERSON'S LIFE AND IN A ROBOT'S LIFE WHERE IT SURPRISES YOU I THINK SURPRISE IS A REALLY POWERFUL THING WERE YOU KNOW HOW THE THING WORKS AND YET IT SURPRISES YOU ATHAT THAT'S A MAGICAL MOMENT FOR US HUMANS SO WHETHER IT'S A CHEST PLAYING PROGRAM THAT DOES SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE THAT MAKES PEOPLE SMILE EAH THOSE MOMENTS HAPPEN WITH OUT PHA ZERO FOR THE FIRST TIME IN CHEST PLAYING OR GRANDMASTERS WERE REALLY SURPRISE BY A MOVE THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE MOVE AND N THEY STUDY AND STUDY AND THEN THEY UNDERSTOOD IT BUT THAT MOMENT OF SURPRISE THAT'S FOR GRANDMASTERS AN CHESK I FIND THAT MOMENT OF SURPRISE REALLY POWERFUL REALLY MAGICAL AND JUST EVERY DAYLIFE BECAUSE IT SUPERSEDES THE THE HUMAN BRAIN IN THAT MOMENT NOT OT SO NOT SUPERSEDES LIKE OUT PERFORMS BUT A SURPRISES YOU TEPOSITIVE SENSE LI GO DIDN'T I DIDN'T THINK YOU COULD DO THAT I I DIDN'T THINK THAT YOU HAD THAT IN YOU AND A I THINK THAT MOMENT IS A BIG TRANSITION FOR A ROBOT FROM FROM A MOMENT OF BEING A SRVANT THAT PARTIC THAT ACCOMPLISHES A PARTICULAR TASK WITH SOME LEVEL OF ACCURACY WITH SOME A RATE O A FAILURE TO AN ENTITY A BEING THAT STRUGGLING JUST LIKE YOU ARE IN THIS WORLD AND THAT THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT MOMENT THAT I THINK A YOU NOGAN FIND MANY PEOPLE IN THE ACCOMMEY THAT TALK LIKE I JUST DID A I I'M NOT SPEAKING LIKE SOME PHILOSOPHER SOME HIPPY I'M SPEAKING FROM PURELY ENGINEERING PERSPECTIVE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ROBATS TO BECOME ENTITIES AND EXPLORE THAT AS A REAL ENGINEERING PROBLEM I SUPPOSE TO A EVERYBODY TREATS ROBOTS IN THE ROBODEST COMMUNITY THEY DON'T EVEN CALLM OR HE OR SHE THATON'T GIVE IM TRY TO AVOID GIVING HIM NAMES THEY'VE REALLY WANT TO SEE IT LIKE A SYSTEM A LIKE A A SERVANT THEY SEE IT AS A SERVANT AT'S TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH A TASK TO ME AND DON'T THINK I'M JUST ROMANTISIZING THE NOTION I THINK IT'S A BEING IT'S A CURRENTLY PERHAPS A DUMB BEING BUT IN IN A LONG ARK OF A HISTORY HUMANS ARE PRETTY DUMB BEINGS TO SO I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENTI I DEND TO REALLY WANT TO EXPLORE THIS A TREATING ROBOTS REALLY AS A AS ENTITIES A THE ATNSO LIKE ANT THE PROMORPHISATION WHICH IS THE F THE ACT OF LOOKING AT THE INANIMATE OBJECT AND PROJECTING ON TO IT LIFE LIKE FEATURES I THINK ROBOTIC GENERALLY SEES THAT A AS A AS A NEGATIVE I SEE IT AS A SUPERPOWER I THAT WE NON TO USE THAT WWELL I'M STRUCK BY HOW THAT REALLY GRABS ON TO THE REAL LATIONSHIP BETWEEN HUMAN AND MACHINE OR HUMAN AN ROBOT SO TUS THE SIMPLE QUESTION IS AND I THINK YOU'VE ALREADY TOLD US THE ANSWER BUT DOES INTERACTING WITH A ROBAT CHANGE YOU DOES IT IN OTHER WORDS DO DO WE DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS TO ROBOT YE I THI I DEFINITE I DONTNTLY THINK SO I THINK A I THINK THE MOMENT YOU SEE A ROBAT OR A I SYSTEMS AS MORE THAN JUST SERVANTS BUT A ANTITIES THEY BEGIN TO CHANGEJUST LIKE GOOD FRIENDS DO JUST LIKE A RELATIONSHIP JUST THE OTHER HUMANS I THINK OF FOR THAT YOU HAVE TRAVE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THAT INTERACTION LIE THE ROBAT'S ABILITY TO A SAY NO TO A TO HAVE ITS OWN SENSE OF IDENTITY TO HAVE ITS OWN SET OF GOLDS THIT'S NOT CONSTANTLY SERVING YOU BICS THAT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE WORLD AND A DO THAT DANCE OF UNDERSTANDING THROUGH COMMUNICATION WITH YOU SI I DEAFINLLY THINK THERE'S A I MEAN HAVE A LOT OF THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS AS YOU MEAN NOW I IN THATS AT THE CORP OF MY LIFELONG DREAM ACTUALLY OF WHAT I WANT TO DO WHICH IS  I BELIEVE THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE A NOTION OF LONELINESS IN THEM THAT WE HAVEN'T DISCOVERED THAT THAT WE HAVEN'T EXPLORED I SHOULD SAY AND I SEE A I SYSTEMS AS HELPING US EXPLORE THAT SO THAT WE CAN BECOME BETTER HUMANS  BETTER PEOPLE TOWARDS EACH OTHER SO I THINK THAT CONNECTION BETWEEN HUMAN AND A I HUMAN AND ROBAT IS IS NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT A WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND OURSELVES IN WAYS THAT ARE LIKE SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE A DEEPER THAN WE EVER COULD HAVE IMAGINED I TEND TO BELIEVE THAT WELL I HAVE A A VERY WILD LEVELS OF A  BELIEF IN TERMS OF HOW IMPACTFUL THAT WOULD BE THATIS SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS I I DON'T I'M ALWAYS BREAK THEM DOWN INTO VARIABLES BUT WE COULD EXPLORE A FLCA FEW OF THOSE VARIABLES AND SEE HOW THEY MAP TO HUMAN ROBOT RELATIONSHIPS A ONE IS JUST TIME RIGHT IF YOU SPEND ZERO TIME WITH ANOTHER PERSON AT ALL IN IN CIBRE SPACE OR ON THE PHOWN ER IN PERSON YOU ASSENTI HAVE NO RELATIONSHIP TO THEM YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME YOU HAVE A RELATION IT IS OBVIOUS BUT I GUESS ONE VARIABLE WOULD BE TIME HOW MUCH TIME YOU SPEND WITH THE OTHER ENTITY ROBOTER HUMAN THE OTHER WOULD BE AM WINDS AND SUCCESSES YOU KNOW YOU ENJOY SUCCESSES TOGETHER UM I'LL GIVE A ABSOLUTELY TRIVIAL EXAMPLE THIS  IN A MOMENT BUT UM THE OTHER WOULD BE FAILURES WHEN YOU STRUGGLE WITH SOMEBODY WHETHER NOT YOU STRUGGLE BETWEEN ONE ANOTHER YOU DISAGREE LIKE I WAS REALLY STRUCK BY THE FACTH YOU SAID THAT ROBOT SAYING NO I'VE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT A ROBOT SAYING NO TO ME UM BUT THERE IT IS I LOOKI LOOK FORWARD TO YOU BEING ONE OF THE FIRST O ESS AN THIS ROBOT AN SO DO I SO THERE'S THERE STRUGGLE YOU GROW YOU KNOW WHEN YOU STRUGGLE WITH SOMEBODY YOU GROW CLOSER SOMETIMES THE STRUGGLES ARE IMPOSED BETWEEN THOSE TWO PEOPLE SO CALLD TROMABONDING THEY CALL IT IN THE WHOLE A PSYCHOLOGY LITERATURE AND PPSYCHOLOGY LARGERE BUT IN ANY CASE I COAND IMAGINE SO TIME SUCCESSES TOGETHER UM A STRUGGLE TOGETHER AND THEN JUST A PEACEFUL TIME HANGING OUT AT HOME WATCHING WATCHING MOVIES A WAKING UP NEAR ONE ANOTHER A HERE WE'RE BREAKING DOWN THEY HAD O ELEMENTS OF RELATIONSHIPS OF ANY KINE SO DO YOU THINK THAT THESE ELEMENTS APPLY TO ROBOUT HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS AND IF SO THAND I COULD SEE HOW IF THE IF THE ROBOT IS ITS OWN ENTITY AND HAS SOME AUTONOMY IN TERMS OF HOW IT REACTS YOU IT'S NOT JUST THEYRE JUST A SERVE YOU IT'S NOT JUST A SERVANT IT ACTUALLY HAS OPINIONS AND CAN TELL YOU WHEN MAYBE YOU'RE THINKING AS FLAD OR YOUR ACTIONS ORE FLOWN IT CAN ALSO LEVE IT CAN COULD ALSO LEAVE SO I'VE NEVER CONCEPTIONALIZE ROBOUT HUMAN INTERACTIONS THIS WAY AT UM SO TELL ME MORE ABOUT HOW THIS MIGHT LOOK ARE WE THINKING ABOUT AM A HUMAN APPEARING ROBOT UM I KNOW YOU AND IHAVE BOTH HAD INTENSE RELATIONSHIPS TO OUR THAT YUWE HAVE SEPARATE DOGS OBVIOUSLY BUT TO TO ANIMALS A SOUND A LOT LIKE HUMAN ANIMAL INTERACTION SO WHAT IS THE IDEAL HUMAN ROBOT RELATIONSHIP SO THERE'S A A LOT TO BE SAID HERE BUT YOU ACTUALLY PINPOINTAD ONE OF THE BIG BIG FIRST TAPS WHICH IS SIDEA OF TIME AND IT'S A HUGE LIMITATION IN MACHINE LEARNING COMMUNITY COLONELLY AS NOT NOW WAY BACK TO LAKE THE ACTUAL DETAILS LIFE LONG LEARNING IS A AS A IS A PROBLEM SPACE THAT A FOCUSIS SOMHOW AI SYSTEMS CAN LEARN OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME WHAT'S CURRENTLY MOST MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEMS ARE NOT ABLE TO DO IS T ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE LISTENED UNDER TIME THE SUCCESSES THE FAILURES ARE JUST CHILLING TOGETHER WATCHYING MOVIES AY I SYSTEMS ARE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT WHICH IS ALL THE BEAUTIFUL MAGICAL MOMENTS THAT I BELIEVE OR THE DAYS FILLED WITH THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO KEEP TRACK OF THOSE TOGETHER WITH YOU THERE AS THEY CAN'T MOVE WITH YOU AND BE WITH YOU NON LIKE LITERALLY WE DON'T HAVE THE THE THE TECHNIQUES TO O DO THE LEARNING THE ACTUAL LEARNING OF CONTAINING THOSE MOMENTS CURRENT MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEMS ARE REALLY FOCUSSE ON UNDERSTANDING THE WORLD IN THE FALLING W IT'S MORE LIKE THE PERCEPTION SYSTEM LIKE LOOKING AROUND UNDERSTAND A LIKE WHAT'S IN THE SCENE THAT THERE'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE SITTING DOWN THAT THERE IS A CAMERAS A MICROPHON THAT THERE'S A TABLE UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THE FACT THAT WE SHARED THIS MOMENT OF TALKIN NG TODAY AND STILL REMEMBER THAT FOR NEXT TIME YOUR FOR LEKE A NEXT TIME YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING REMEMBER THAT THIS MOMENT HAPPEN WE DON'T KNOW HO TO DO THAT A TECHE NIQUIT THIS IS WHAT I'M THIS IS WHAT I'M A HOPING TO ENEVATE ON AS THEY THINK IT'S A VERY VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF WHAT MEANS TO CREATE A DUPILATIONSHIP THAT SHARING OF MOMENTS TOGETHER COULD YOU POST A PHOTO OF YOU IN THE ROBOT LIKESELF SELFY WITH ROBODY AND THE ROBOTS SEES THAT IMAGE AND RECOGNIZES THAT WAS TIME SPENT THERE WAS THERE WERE SMILES OR THERE WERE TEARS AND CREATE SOME SORT OF UM THAT TRICK OF OF EMOTIONAL DEPTH AN THE RELATIONSHIP AND UP DATE ITS BEHAVIOR SO IT TACTED YOU IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT AN SAY WHY HAVEN'T YOU TUXTED ME BACK OH YES ALL OF THOSE THINGS BUT WE GET WICKEN DIGIN TO THAT BUT I THINK THAT TIME ELMENT FORGET EVERYTHING ELSE JUST SHARING MOMENTS TOGETHER THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING I BELIEVE THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING  THERE'S SPECIFIC THINGS THAT ARE MORE IN TERMS OF SYSTEMS THAT CAN EXPLAIN YOU A IT'S IT'S MORE TECHNICAL THAN PROBABLY LIT BUT ALL FLYING AS 'VE KIND OF WILD IDEAS HOW THAT CAN REVOLUTIONIZE A SO FROM THAT WORKS AND  AND OPERATING SYSTEMS BUT THE POINT IS THAT ELMENT ALONE FORGET ALL THE OTHER THINGS WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU LIKE EMOTIONS A SAYING NO ALL THAT A JUST REMEMBER SHARING MOMENTS TOGETHER WOULD CHANGE EVERYTHING WE DON'T CORNENLLY HAVE SYSTEMS THAT A A SHARE SHARE MOMENTS TOGETHER LIKE EVEN JUST YOU AND YOUR FRIDGE JUST ALL THOSE TIMES YOU WENT LATE AT NIGHT AND AND EIHTE THINGS SHOULDN'T HAVE EATEN THAT WAS A SECRET MOMENT YOU HAD WITH YOUR REFRIGERATOR YOU SHARED THAT MOMENT THAT DARKNESS OR THAT BEAUTIFUL MOMENT WE YOU JUST A YOU KNOW LIKE HEART BROKEN FOR SOME REASON YOU'RE EATING THAT ICE CREAM OR WHATEVER THAT'S A SPECIAL MOMENT AND THAT REFRIGERATOR WAS THERE FOR YOU AND THE FACT THAT IT MISST THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMEMBER THAT A IS IS IS TRAGIC AND ONCE IT DOES REMEMBER THAT I THINK YOU'E GOING A BE VERY ATTACHED THERE EFRIGERATOR YOU YOU'R GOING TO GO THROUGH SOME THROUGH SOME HELL WITH OUT FRIGERIC MOST OF US HAVE LIKE IN IN A IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD HAVE WEIRD RELATIONSHIPS WITH FOOD RITE SO YOU CAN GO THROUGH SOME MA SOME DEEP MOMENTS OF TRAMA AND TRIUMPH WITH FOOD AND AT THE COURP OF THAT IS THE REFRIGERATOR SO A SMART REFRIGERATOR I BELIEVE WOULD A CHANGE SOCIETY NOT JUST THE REFRIGERATOR BUT THE THESE IDEAS IN THE SYSTEMS ALL AROUND US SO THAT I IIS WON TO COMMENT ON HOW POWERFUL THE IDEA OF TIME IS AND THEN THERE IS A BUNCH OF ELEMENTS OF ACTUAL INTERACTION OF A ALLOWING YOU AS A HUMAN TO FEEL LIKE YOUR BEING HEARD TRULY HEARD TRULY UNDERSTOOD THAT WE HU THA DEEP FRIENDSHIPES LIKE THAT I THINK BUT WERE STILL THERE'S STILL AN ELEMENT OF SELFISHNESS THERE STILL AN ELEMENT OF A NOT REALLY BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND ANOTHER HUMAN AND A LOT OF THE TIMES WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH TRAMA TOGETHER THROUGH DIFFICULT TIMES AND THROUGH SUCCESSES YOU'RE ACTUALLY STARTING TO GET THAT INCLING OF UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHER BUT I THINK THAT CUL BE DONE MORE AGGRESSIVELY YOU  A MORE EFFICIENTLY LIKE IF YOU THINK OF A GREAT THERAPIST I THINK I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY BEEN TO THERAPIST BUT I'M A BELIEVER I USED TO ONE TO BE A SYCHITRIS YO RUSSIONS GO TO THER SNANCE DON'T THEY DON'T AND A IF THEY DO THE THERAPIST ON'T LIVE TO TELL THE STORY AI YE I I DO BELIEVE IN TALK THAT WHICH FRIENDSHIP IS TO MES ITS TALK THER PEER LIKE IT'S  THE IT'S YOUG NECERNY TO TALK IT'S LIKE JUST CONNECTING A THOUGH IN SPACE OF IDEAS AND SPACE OF EXPERIENCES I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF IDEAS HOW HODMEK A ASSISTANCE TO BE ABLE TO ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND TRULY HERE ANOTHER HUMAN THIS IS WHAT WE TRID TO DO WITH PODCASTING I I THINK THERE'S WAYS TO DO THAT WOITH THEY IYE BUT ABOVE ALL ELSE JUST REMEMBERING THE COLLECTION OF MOMENTS THEY MAKE UP THE DAY THE WEAK THE MONTHS I THINK I YOU MAY BEHAVE SOME OF THIS AS WELL SOME OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS STILL ARE THE FRIENDS FROM HIGH SCHOOL THAT'S TIME WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A MUNCHE SHED TOGETHER AND THAT LIKE WE'VE WE'RE VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE BUT JUST THE FACT THAT UD BEEN THROUGH THAT AND WE REMEMBER THOSE MOMENTS AN THOSE MOMENTS SOMEHOW CREATE A DEPTH OF CONNECTION LIKE NOTHING ELSE LIKE YOU AND YOUREFRIGERATOR  I LOVE THAT BECAUSE THE I'D A MY GRADUATE ADVISER JON'T FORTE SHE PASSED AWAY BUT WHEN SHE PASSED AWAY SOMEWHAT HY SAID AT HER UM AT HER MEMORIAL IM YOU KNOW ALL THESE AMAZING THINGS HE HAD DONE ET CETERA AND THEN HER KIDS GOT UP THERE AND SHE HAD YOUNG CHILDREN THAN THAT I KNEW AS THEY WERE OR WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH THEM AND SO IS REALLY AN YOU EVEN NOW I CAN FEEL LIKE YOUR HEART GETS HEAVY THINKING ABOUT THES SIRGAN TO GROW UP WITHOUT THEIR MOTHER AND IT WAS REALLY AMAZING VERY VERY STRONG A YOUNG GIRLS AN OUN'T E YOUNG WOMEN AND WHAT THEY SAID WAS INCREDIBLE THEY SAID WHAT THEY REALLY APPRECIATED MOST ABOUT THEIR MOTHER WHO WAS AN AMAZING PERSON IS ALL THE UNSTRUCTURED TIME THEY SPENT TOGETHER SO IT WASN'T THE TRIPS TO THE ZOU IT WASN'T YOU KNOW OH YOU KNOW SHE WOKE UP IT FIVE IN THE MORNING AND DROVE US TO SCHOOL SHE DID ALL THOSE THINGS TOO SHE AT TWO HOUR COMMUTING EACH DIRECTION IT WAS INCREDIBLE RAN ALAB ET CETERA BUT IT WAS THE UNSTRUCTURED TIME SO ON THE PASSING OF THEIR MOTHER THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY REMEMBERED WAS THE THE BIGGEST GIVE AND I WHAT BONDED THEM TO HER WAS ALL THE TIME WHERE THEY JUST CONE HUNG OUT AND THE WAY YOU DESCRIBED THE RELATIONSHIP TO REFRIGERATOR IS A SO I WANT E TAY HUMAN LIKE BUT I'M ALMOST RELUCTANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE WHEN I'M REALIZING AS WE'RE TALKING IS THAT WHAT WE THINK OF AS HUMAN LIKE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE THE A LOWER FORM OF RELATIONSHIP THERE MAY BE RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE FAR BETTER THAN THE SORTS OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE CAN CONCEIVE IN OUR MINDS RIGHT NOW BASED ON WHAT THESE MACHINE RELATIONSHIP INTERACTIONS COULD TEACH US DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT YE I THINK SO I THINK THERE'S NO REASON SEE MACHINES AS A SOMEHOW A IN CAPABLE OF TEACHING US SOMETHING THAT'S DEEPLY HUMAN I I DON'T THINK A HUMANS HAVE A MONOPOLY ON THAT I THINK WE UNDERSTAND OURSELVES VERY POORLY AND WE NEED THAT TO HAVE THE KIND OF A APROMPTING FROM A FROM A MACHINE AND DEFININE PART OF THAT IS JUST REMEMBERING THE MOMENTS REMEMBERING THE MOMENTS IMI YOU KNOW I THINK THE ON STRUCTURE TIME TOGETHER I WONDER IF IT'S QUITE SO ONSTRUCTURED THAT LIKE CALLING THIS PODCAST ON STRUCTURE TIME MAYBE WHAT THEY MEANT WAS UM IT WASN'T A BIG OUTING IT WASN THAS THERE WAS NO SPECIFIC GOAL BUT A GOAL WAS CREATED THROUGH THE LACK OF A GOAL I CREE JUST HANG OUT IN THEN Y START PLAYING YOU KNOW THOME WOR YEND AT PLAYING THOMEWORE FOR AN HOUR THERE SO IT'S IT'S THE STRUCTURE E EMERGES FROM LACK OF STRUCTURE NO BUT THE THING IS THE MOMENTS THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THOSE TIMES THAT CREATES SPECIAL MOMENTS AND A I THINK THAT THOSE COULD BE AUTOMIZED FOR I THINK WE THINK OF LIKE A BIG OUTING AS I DON'T KNOW GOING TO SIX FLAGS OR SOMETHING OR A SOME BIG A THE GRANDCANYON OR GOING TO SOME UNNR THAT THAT I THINK WE WED NEED TO WE DON'T QUITE YET UNDERSTAND AS HUMANS WHAT CREATES MAGICAL MOMENTS I THINK THIS POSSIBLE TO AUTHOMIZE A LOT OF ES THINGS AND PERHAPS LIKE PODCASTING IS HELPING PEOPLE DISCOVER THAT LIKE AH MAYBE THE THING ONE OPTIMIZED FOR ISN'T NECESSARILY A LIKE SOME A SEXY A LIKE QUICK CLIPSE MAYBE WHAT WE WANT IS LONG FORM AUTHENTICITY DEPTH DEPTH SO WE TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT ACERTAINLY FROM DEEP CONNECTION BETWEEN BETWEEN HUMANS AND HUMANS ANA SYSTEMS I THINK LONG CONVERSATIONS OR LONG PERIODS OF COMMUNICATION OVER A A SERIES OF MOMENTS LIKE MINUT PERHAPS SEEMINGLY INSIGNIFICANT TO THE BIG ONES THE BIG SUCCESSIS THE BIG A FAILURES THOSE ARE ALL JUST STITCHING THOSE TOGETHER AND TALKING THROUGHOUT I THINK THAT'S A THE FORMULA FOR A REALLY REALLY DEEP CONNECTION THAT FROM VLIKE THE VERY SPECIFIC ENGINEERING PERSPECTIVE IS A I THINK OF FASCINATING OPEN PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN REALLY WORKED ON VERY MUCH AND FOR ME FROM A IF I HAVE THE GUTS AND A I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS TO SAY BUT ONE OF IT IS GOTS AS I BILL A START UP AROUND IT YE SO LIP LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS START UP UNLES'S TALK ABOUT THE THE DREAM YOU'VE MENTION THIS DREAM BEFORE IN OUR PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS ALWAYS AS LITTLE HINTS DROPPED HERE AND THERE I JUST A FR NDYMON LES SAING THERE'S NEVER BEEN IN OWFLINE CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS DREAM I'M NOT PRIVY TO ANYTHING AH EXCEPT WHAT LEC SAYS NOW AH AND I REALIZE THAT THERE'S NO WAY TO CAPTURE THE FULL ASSENCE OF A DREAM AND ANY KOND OF VERBAL STATEMENT AM IN A WAY THAT CAPTURES ALL OF IT BUT WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THIS DREAM THAT YOU'VE REFERRED TO NOW SEVERAL TIMES A WHEN WE'VE SAT DOWN TOGETHER AND TALKED ON THE PHONE MAYBE IT'S THIS COMPANY MAY BET SOMETHING DISTINCT IF YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE COULD BE GREAT OF YOU CHARE AL BIT ABOUT WHAT THAT IS SURE SO THAT THE WAY PEOPLE EXPRESS LONG TERM VISION I'VE NOTICED IS QUITE DIFFERENT ELAN AS AN EXAMPLE SOMEBODY WHO CAN VERY CRISPLY SAY EXACTLY WHAT THE GOAL IS ALSO HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THE PROMESE SOWTHING HAVE NOTHING TO WITH HUMANS SO MY LONG TERM VISION IS A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT TO EXPRESSIN WORDS I'VE NOTICED AS I'VE TRIED IT COULD BE MY BRAINS FAILURE BUT THERE'S A WASTE O SNEAK UP TO IT SO BLOOMI TO SAY A FEW THINGS EARLY ON IN LIFE A IN IN ALSING THE RECENT YEARS I'VE INTERACTED WITH A FEW ROBOTS WHERE I UNDERSTOOD THERE'S MAGIC THERE AND THAT MAGIC COULD BE SHARED BY MILLIONS IF IT'S SA BROUGHT TO LIGHT WHEN I FIRST MET SPOT FROM BOSTON DYNAMICS I REALIZED THIS MAGIC THERE THAT NOBODY ELSE IS SEEING IS THE DO IS THE DOG SORRY THE SPOT IS THE FORLEGGED A ROBAT FROM BOSTON DYNAMICS SOM PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE SEEN IT THIS YELLOW DOG AND A E'LL SOMETIMES IN LIFE YOU JUST NOTICE SOMETHING THAT JUST GRABS YOU AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THIS MAGIC IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE EVERY SINGLE DEVICE IN THE WORLD THE THE WAY THAT I THINK A MAYBE STEEVE JOBS THOUGHT ABOUT THE PERSONAL COMPUTER AA LASDIDN'T THINK ABOUT THE PERSON COMPUTER THIS WAY PUS STIVE DID WHICH IS LIKE HE THOUGHT THAT THE PERSONAL COMPUTER SHOULD BE A THIN AS A SHET OF PAPER AND EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE ONE ME THIS IDEA I THINK IT IS HEART BREAKING THAT A WE'RE GETTING THE WORLD IS BEING FILLED UP WITH MACHINES THEY'RE SOULLESS AND I THINK EVERY ONE OF THEM CAN HAVE THAT SAME MAGIC ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THA ALSO INSPIRED ME INTERMS OF A START UP IS THAT MAGIC CAN BE ENGINEERED MUCH EASIER THAN I THOUGHT THAT'S MY INTUITION WITH EVERYTHING IVEVER BUILT AND WORKED ON SO THAT THE DREAM IS TO AD A BIT OF THAT MAGIC IN EVERY SINGLE COMPUTING SYSTEM IN THE WORLD SO THE WAY THAT WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM FOR A LONG TIME WAS A THE PRIMARY OPERATING SYSTEM EVERYDY INTERACTED WITH THEY BUILT APSE ON TOP OF IT I THINK THIS  IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE AS A WAYER IS ALMOST AS AN OPERATING SYSTEM IN A EVERY DEVICE THAT HUMANS INTERACTED WITH IN THE WORLD AND WITH THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE THE ACTUAL DREAM WHEN I WAS EFICI KID A IT DIDN'T HAVE THIS CONCRETE FORM OF A BUSINESS IT HAD MORE A A DREAM OF A EXPLORING YOUR OWN LONELINESS BY INTERACTING WITH MACHINES ROBOTS A THIS DEEP CONNECTION BETWEEN HUMANS A ROBOTS WAS ALWAYS A DREAM AND SO FOR ME I'D LOVE TO SEE A WORLD WITH THEREIS EVERY HOME AS A ROBOUT AND NOT A ROBOT THAT WATCHES THE DISHES A WHERA OR A SEX ROBOUT OR AND I THINK OF ANY KIND OF ACTIVITY THE ROBI CAN DO BUT MORE LIKE A COMPANION A WI AMILY MEMBER A FAMILY MEMBER THE WAY DOG IS A BUT A DOG THAT'S ARKS  ABLE TO SPEAK YOUR LANGUAGE TO SO NOT JUST CONNECT THE WAY A DOG DOES BY LOOKING AT YOU AND LOOKING AWAY AND ALMOST LIKE SMILING WITH ITS SOUL IN THAT KIND OF WAY A BUT ALSO TO ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE HEW LIKE WHY YOU SO EXCITED ABOUT THE SUCCESSES LIKE UNDERSTAND THE DETAILS UNDERSTAND O THE DRAMAS AND THAT I JUST THINK THAT AD ALWAYS FILLED ME WITH EXCITEMENT THAT I I CULD  WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLGENS BRING JOY TO A LOT OF PEOPLE MORE RECENTLY I'VE BEEN MORE OR MORE HARDBROKEN TO SEE THE KIND OF DIVISION DERISION EVEN HATE THAT'S BOILING UP ON AON THE INTRNATE THROUGH SOCIAL NUTWORKS AND I THOUGHT THIS KIND OF MECHANISM IS EXACTLY APPLICABLE WUT IN THE CONTAXT OF SOCIAL THAT WORKS AS WELL SO IT'S AN OPERATING SYSTEM THAT A SERVES AS YOUR GUIDE TO A IN IT ON THE INTRONET ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WITH A YOU TOO IN SOCIAL NELTWORKS CURRENTLY IS THERE OPTIMIZING FOR ENGAGEMENT I THINK IF YOU CREATE A IYE SYSTEMS THAT NO EACH INDIVIDUAL PERSON YOUARE ABLE TO OPTIMIZE FOR LONG TERM GROWTH FOR A LONG TERM HAPPINESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL OF THE INDIVIDUAL OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND A THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER THINGS TO SAY WHICH IS THA IN ORDER FOR A IE SYSTEMS TO TO LEARN EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU A THEY NEED TO COLLECT THEY NEED TO JUST LIKE YOU AND I WHEN WE TALK OFF LYING OR COLLECTING DATA ABOUT EACH OTHER SECRETS BOUGHT EACH OTHER THE SAME WAY A I HAS TO DO THAT AND AT HAD ALLOWS YOU TO AND THAT REQU ISE YOU TO RETHINK IDEAS OF OWNERSHIP OF DATA I THINK EACH INDIVIDUAL SHOULD OWN ALL OF THEIR DATA AND VERY EASILY BE ABLE TO LEAVE JUST LIKE A I SYSTEMS CAN LEAVE HUMANS CAN DISAPPEAR A AND DELEAT ALL F THEIR DATA IN A MOMENT'S NOTICE AM WHICH IS ACTUALLY BETTER THAN WE HUMANS CAN DO THIS ONCE WE LOAWD THE DATA INTO EACH OTHER ITS THERE I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT TO BE BOTH A GIVE PEOPLE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THEIR DATA IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH TRUST THAT THEY CAN TRUST YOU AND THE SECOND PART OF TRUST IS TRANSPARENCY A WHENEVER THE DATA IS USED TO MAKE A VERY CLEAR WHAT IS BEING USED FOR AND NOT CLEAR IN A LOYALLY LEGAL SENSE BUT CLEAR IN A WAY THAT'S PEOPLE REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS USED FOR I BELIEVE WHEN PEOPLE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DELEAT ALL THEIR DATA AND WALK AWAY AND TO KNOW HOW THE DATA IS BEING USED I THINK THEY'LL STAY I AH THE THE POSSIBILITY OF A CLEAN BREAK UP IS ACTUALLY WHAT WILL KEEP PEOPLE TO GELYA I THINK SO I THINK EXACTLY I THINK A A HAPPY MARRIAGE REQUIRES THE ABILITY TO DIVORCE EASILY WITHOUT THE THE THE DIVORCE AND INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX OR WHATEVER THE'S CULENLY GOING ON THAT THERE'S SO MUCH MONEY TO BE MADE FROM LAWYERS NDIVORCE BUT YET THEY BILLY TO LEAVE IS WHAT ENABLES LOVE I THINK TETR THING I'VE HEARD THE PHRASE A FROM A SEMI SYNICAL FRIEND THAT A MARRIAGE IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DIVORCE BUT NOW WE'VE HEARD THAT DIVORCE OR THE POSSIBILITY OF DIVORCE COULD BE THE LEADING CAUSE OF MARRIAGE OF A HAPPY MARRIAGE GOOD POINT OF A HAPPY MARRIAGE SO THAT YI AT  THER'S THE LOT DETAILS THERE BUT TH THE BIG DREAM AS THAT CONNECTION BETWEEN A I SYSTEM AND A HUMAN AND AVEN TA OU KNOW THERE'S SO MUCH FEAR ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND ABOUT ROBATS THAT I HAVEN'T QUITE FOND THE RIGHT WORDS TO EXPRESS THAT VISION BECAUSE THE VISION I HAVE IS ONE A IS NOT LIKE SOME NAIVE DELUSION AL VISION OF LIKE TACKNOWLEDGE IS GOING TO SAVE EVERYBODY IT'S I REALLY DO JUST HAVE A POSITIVE VIEW OF WAYS A I SYSTEMS CAN HELP HUMANS EXPLORE THEMSELVES I LOVE THAT POSITIVITY AND I I AGREE THAT THEY THE STANCE A EVERYTHING IS DOOMED IS  EQUALLY BAD IM TO SAY THAT EVERYTHING'S CAN TURN OUT ALL RIGHT THERE HAS TO BE A DEDICATED EFFORT IM CLEARLY YOUR I'M THINKING ABOUT WHAT THAT DEDICATED EFFORT WOULD LOOK LIKE YOU MENTION TO UM TWO ASPECTS TO THIS DREAM YOU AND ONETO MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY IM CAN ACT IF THEY DO OR IF THEYS ARE INDEPENDENT STREAMS A ONE WAS THIS AM HYPOTHETICAL ROBAT FAMILY MEMBER OR SOME OTHER FORM OF ROBAT THAT WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE TO EXPERIENCE THE KIND OF I'M DELIGHT THAT YOU EXPERIENCED A MANY TIMES AND TH AT YOU WOULD LIKE THE WORLD TO TO BE ABLE TO H AVE AND IT'S IT SUCH A BEAUTIFUL IDEA OF THIS GIVE AND THE OTHER IS SOCIAL MEDIA OR A SOCIAL NETWORK PLATFORMS THAT I REALLY SERVE INDIVIDUALS AND AND THEIR BESTSELVES IN THEIR HAPPINESS IN THEIR GROWTH IS THERE CROSS OVER BETWEEN THOSE ORE THESE TWO PARALLEL DRING HOWN TO PRESENT THE SAME THING IT'S IT'S A DIFFICULT TO CUNT A EXPLAIN WITH OUT GOING TO DETAILS BUT MAY BE ONE EASY WAY TO EXPLAIN THE WAY I THINK ABOUT SOCIAL NETWORKS IS YOU CREAT IN AI SYSTEM THAT'S YOURS THAT'S YOURS IS NOT LIKE AMAZONELECTS OF THE CENTRALIZE YOU OWN THE DATA IT'S IT'S LEARNT IT'S LIKE YOUR LITTLE FRIEND THAY BECOMES YOUR REPRESENTATIVE ON TWITTER THAT THAT HELPS YOU FIND THINGS THAT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD THAT WILL A ALSO CHALLENGE YOUR THINKING TO MAKE YOU GROW BUT NOT GET TO THAT A NOT LET YOU GET LOST IN THE NEGATIVE SPILE OF DOPENING THAT THAT THEY GETS YOU TO BE ANGRY OR MOST JUST GET YOU TO BE NOT OPEN TO LEARNING AND SO THAT LITTLE REPRESENTATIVE IS OPTIMIZING YOUR LONG TERM HEALTH AND IT'S A I BELIEVE THAT THAT IT'S NOT ONLY GOOD FOR HUMAN BEINGS IT'S ALSO GOOD FOR BUSINESS I THINK LONG TERM YOU CAN MAKE A LOT OF MONEY A BY CHALLENGING THIS IDEA THAT THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE MONEY IS MAXIMIZING ENGAGEMENT AND WIT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE DISAGREE ON ME ON IS THEY THINK TWITTERS ALWAYS GOING TO WIN LIKE MAXIMIZING ENGAGEMENTIS ALWAYS GOING TO IN I DON'T THINK SE I THINK PEOPLE HAVE WOKEN UP NOW TO UNDERSTANDING THAT LIKE THEY DON'T  ALWAYS FEEL GOOD THE ONCE WHO AR ON TWITTER A LOT THAT THAT THEY DON'T ALWAYS FEEL GOOD AT THE END OF THE WEEK I WOULD LOVE FEED BACK FROM WHATEVER THIS A CREATURE A WHATEVER I CAN I DON'T KNOA TO CALL IT UM AS TO YOU KNOW MAY BE T THE END OF THE WEEK IT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY UNFOLLOW SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT I FOLLOW BECAUSE IT REALIZED THROUGH SOME REAL REALLY SMART DATA ABOUT HOW I WAS FEELING INSIDE OR HOW WAS SLEEPING OR SOMETHING THAT THAT JUST WASN'T GOOD FOR ME BUT IT MIGHT ALSO PUT THINGS AND PEOPLE IN FRONT OF ME THAT A I OUGHT TO SEE IS THAT HE CON BE ASK LIVER OF WHAT THIS WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE THE WHOLE POINT BECAUSE OF THE INTERACTION BECAUSE OF A SHARING THE MOMENTS AND LEARNING A LOT ABOUT YOU YOU'RE NOW ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT INTERACTIONS LED YOU TO BECOME A BETTER BURGINYOU YOURSELF I THE PERSON YOU YOURSELF ARE HAPPY WITH AH THIS ISN'T YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE INTO FLAT EARTH AND YOU FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT IT THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT EARTH IS FLAT LIKE THA IDEA YOU SHOULD SCENSER THAT IS RIDICULOUS IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD AND YOU BECOMING THE BEST VERSION YOURSELF I THINK YOU SHOULD BE GETTING AS MUCH FLATTEARTH AS POSSIBLE NO I'S ALSO GOOD TO CHALLENGE YOUR IDEAS BUT NOT BECAU AS THE CENTRALIZED A COMMITTEE DECIDED BUT BECAUSE YOU TELL TO THE SYSTEM THAT YOU LIKE CHALLENGING YOUR IDEAS I THINK ALL OF US DO AND THEN WHICH EXEUTOV DOESN'T DO THAT WELL ONCE YOU GO DOWN THE FLATTER ITS RABBIT HOLE THAT'S ALL YOU CN TO SEE IT'S NICE TO GET A SOME REALLY POWERFUL COMMUNICATORS TO ARGUE AGAINST FLATTER AND IT'S NICE TO SEE THAT O FOR YOU AND AND POTENTIALLY AT LEAST LONG TERM TO EXPAND YOUR HORIZONS MAY BE THE EARTH IS IS NOT FLAT BUT IF YOU CONTINUE TO LIVE YOUR WHOLE LIFE THANKING THE EARTH IS FLAT I THINK AND YOUR BEING A GOOD FATHER OR SON OR DAUGHTER AND LIKE YOUR BEING THE BEST VERSION YOURSELF AND YOU'RE HAPPY WITH YOURSELF A I THINK O THE EARTH IS FLAT SO LIKE I I THINK THIS KIND OF IDEA AND I'M JUST USING THAT KIND OF SILLY RIDICULOUS EXAMPLE BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF CENTRALIZED FORCE IS CONTROLLING WHAT YOU CAN IT CAN'T SEE BUT I ALSO DON'T LIKE THIS IDEA OF LIKE NOT CENSURING ANYTHING BECAUSE THAT'S ALWAYS THE BIGGEST PROBLEMIT THAT IS THIS IT'S H THIS ESCENTRAL DECIDER I THINK YOU YOURSELF CAN DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE AND NOT AND IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A COMPANION THAT A REMINDS YOU THAT YOU FELT SHITY LAST TIME YOU DID THIS OR YOU FELT GOOD LAST TIME YOU DID THIS I FEEL LIKE IN EVERY GOOD STORY THERE'S THAT THERE'S A GUIDE OR A COMPANION THAT FLIES OUT OR FORAGES A LITTL BIT FURTHER A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY AND BRINGS BACK INFORMATION THAT HELPS US OR AT LEAST TRIES TO STEER US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SU I ASIA THT'S EXACTLY A THAT'S EXACTLY THE A WHAT I'M THINKING AND WHAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON I I SHOULD MENTION AS A BUNCH OF DIFFICULTIES HERE I  YOU SEE ME UP AND DOWN A LITTLE BIT RECENTLY A SO THERE'S TECHNICALLY A LOT OF CHALLENGES HERE THIS LIKE WITH A LOT OF TECHNOLOGIES AND THE REASON I'M TALKING ABOUT IT IN A POTGAST COMFORTABLY AS IT WAS TO WORKING IT IN SECRET IS IT'S REALLY HARD AND MAY BE IT'S TIME AS NOT COME AND THAT'S SOMETHING EFT THE  CONSTEN STRUGGLE WITH IN TERMS OF LIKE ONTROPRENERALY IS AS A START UP  LI I'VE ALSO MENTION TO YOU MAY BE OFF LINE I REALLY DON'T CARE ABOUT MONEY I DON'T CARE ABOUT A BUSINESS SUCCESS ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS IM SO IT'S A DIFFICULT DECISION TO MAKE HOW MUCH OF YOUR TIME DO YOU WANT TO GO ALL IN HERE AND GIVE EVERYTHING TO THIS A 'SA BIG ROLL THE DICE BECAUSE I'VE ALSO REALIZE THAT'S WORKING ON SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS BOTH WITH A THE REBOTICS AND THE TECHNICAL SIDE ON INTERMS OF A THE THE MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEM THAT I'M DESCRIBING IT'S LONELY IT'S REALLY LONELY BECAUSE A BOTH ON A PERSONAL LEVEL L AND A TECHNICAL LEVEL SO IN THE TECHNICAL LEVEL I'M SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE THAT KIND OF A DOUBT ME WHICH I THINK ALL ANTROPINERAS GO THROUGH AND THEY DOUBT YOU IN THE FOLLOWING SENSE THEY A THEY KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS LIKE THE PEOPLE THAT A THE COLLEAGUES OF MINE THEY KNOW HOW DIFFICULT LIFE LONG LEARNING IS THEY ALSO KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT DIS TOBULE THE SYSTEM LIKE THIS I TTO BBUILD THE COMPETITOR SOCIAN NOUTWORK AND DA IN GENERAL THERE'S A KIND OF VA LONELINESS TO JUST WORKING ON SOMETHING ON YOUR OWN FOR A LONG PAIRS OF TIME AND YOU START TO DOL WHETHER A GIVEN THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A TRACK RECORD OF SUCCESS LIKE THAT'S A BIG ONE WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR SPECIALLIN YOU'R YOUNG BUT I STILL HAVE THAT I'M MOST THINGS YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR IS LIKE AND YEOF THESE BIG DREAMS HOW DO YOU KNOW YOURE HOW DO YU KNOW YOU'RE ACTUALLY AS SMART AS YOU THINK YOU ARE THIKE HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS DREAM YOU AVE THIS AMBITION YOUSOR DON'T DON'T BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE GON O PULLING ON A ON A STRING HOPING THAT STHE NO BIGG R BALL OF YARN YES UT YE HAVE THIS KIND OF INTUITION I I I THINK I PRIDE MYSELF IN KNOWING WHAT I'M GOOD AT BECAUSE THE REASON I HAVE THAT INTUITION IS CAUSE I THINK I'M VERY GOOD AT KNOWING ALL THE THINGS I STUCK AT WHICH IS BASICALLY EVERYTHING SO LIKE WHENEVER I KNOTICE LIKE WAIT A MINUTE I'M KIND OF GOOD AT THIS WHICH IS VERY RARE FOR ME I THINK LIKE THAT THAT MAG BE A BALL YARN WORTH PULLING AT AND THE THING WITH TH INTERMS OF ENGINEERING A SYSTEMS THAT ARE ABLE TO INTRACT WITH HUMANS I THINK I'M VERY GOOD AT THAT AND DA BECAUSE YOU WULD TALK ABOUT POT CASTING AND SO ON I DON'T KNOW IF I'M VERY GOOD APOIC YOU'RE VERY GOOD AT POGAN BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T A I THINK MAY BE AHIT IS COMPELLING TO TO FOR PEOPLE TO WATCH A A KIND HEARTED IDIOTS STRUGGLE WITH THIS T WITH THIS FORM MAY BE THAT'S WHAT IWITWHAT'S COMPELLING BUT IN TERMS OF LIKE ACTUAL BEING A GOOD ENGINEER OF HUMAN ROBOT INTERACTION SYSTEMS I THINK I'M GOOD BUT IT'S HARD TO KNOW UNTIL YOU DO IT AND THEN THE WORLD KEEPS TELLING YOU'RE NOT A AND IS JUST IS FULL ADOL ANS REALLY HARD AND I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THAT RECENTLY IT'S IT'S KIND OF A FASTINING STRUGGLE BUT THEN THAT'S WHERE THE GOGINS THING COMES IN IS LIKE A ASIDE FROM THE STAY HARD BY THE FUCKER IS THE A LIKE WHENEVER YOU'RE STRUGGLING THAT'S A GOOD SIGN THAT IF YOU KEEP GOING THEY YOU'RE GOING TO BE ALONE IN THE SUCCESS RIGHT LIKE A WAT'S NOT WILLING YOUR CASE HOWEVER I AGREE AT ITUALLY DAVID HAD O POST RECENTLY THAT I THOUGHT WAS AMONG HIS MANY BRILLIANT POST WAS ONE OF THE MORE BRILLIANT ABOUT HOW OM YOU WE TALKED ABOUT THIS MITH OF TE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL AND INSTEAD WHAT HE REPLACE THAT MITH WITH WAS A CONCEPT THAT EVENTUALLY YOUR EYES ADAPT TO THE DARK AT THAT THE TUNNEL IT'S NOT ABOUT A LIGHT AT THE END THAT IT'S REALLY ABOUT ADAPTING TO THE CATONA I'S VERY GOG IN ALO M SO MUCH AT YET YOU GO SURE  LAN IIT A LOT IN COMMON ON KNOWING YOU BOTH A BIT I'M YOU SURE A LOT IN COMMON BUT IN IS THIS LONELINESS AND THE AND THE PURSUIT OF THIS DREAM IT SEEMS TO ME HAS A CERTAIN COMPONENT TO IT THAT IS EXTREMELY VALUABLE WHICH IS THAT THE LONELINESS ITSELF COULD SERVE AS A DRIVER TO BUILD THE COMPANION FOR THE JOURNEY WELL I'M VERY DEEPLY AWARE OF THAT SO THIK  SOME PEOPLE CAN NA MAKE CAS I TALK ABOUT LOVE A LOT I REALLY LOVE EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD AND BUT AS ALSO LOVE HUMANS FRIENDSHIP AND A ROMANTIC YOU KNOW LIKE EVEN THE CHEESY STUFF AM JUST YOU LIKE ROMANTIC MOVIES YET H NES NOT I'M NO NT A I GOT SO MUCSHIT FROM ROGEN ABAT LIKE A WAS THAT THE TANGLE SEEN FROM A SENTOFE WOMAN BUT YES I FIND A LIKE A WON'T THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN A WOMAN IN A RED DRESS LIKE A YOU I JUST LIKE GLASSY YOU SHOULD MOVE TO ARGENTINA MYYE YOU'RE MY FATHERS ARGENTINE AND YOUKNOWHAT HE SAID WHEN I OH WHEN I WENT ON YOUR PODCAS FOR THE FIRST TIME HE SAID HE DRESS AS WELL BECAUSE AN ARGENTIN A THE MEN GO TO A WEDDING OR A PART YOR SOMETHING YOWING YOU ASK THEY BY HALF WAY THROUGH THE NIGHT TENMENTS ANDTHE NIGHT ALL THE JACKETS ARE OFF YET IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYONE'S UNDRESSING FOR THE PARTY THEY JUST GOT DRESSED UP FOR AND HE SAID  A AND HE SAID YOU KNOW LIKE THE WAY HE DRESSES THAND WHEN I START YOUE TOK ABOUT YOU AND THEN WHEN EWHEN I STARVE MY PODCASS HE SAID WHY DON'T YOU WEAR A A REAL SUIT LIKE YOUR ELA IO THAT THINK  UM BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT UM THIS THIS PURSUIT JUST A BIT MORE BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS IS BUILDING A NOT JUST A SOLUTION FOR LONELINESS BUT YOU'VE ALLUDED TO THE LONELINESS AS ITSELF AN IMPORTANT THING AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK WITHIN PEOPLE THERE IS A CAVERNS OF FOUGHTS AND SHAME BUT ALSO JUST THE DESIRE TO BE I'M TO HAVE RESINENCE TO TO BE SEEN AND HEARD AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT IT'S SEEN AND HEARD THROUGH LANGUAGE UM BUT THESE RESERVOIRS ARE  OF LONELINESS I THINK AM THERE WELL THEY'RE INTERESTING MAYBE YOU COULD COMMON A LOTLE BIT ABOUT IT BECAUSE JUST AS OFTEN AS YOU TALK ABOUT LOVE I'M QUANTIFIED IT BUT IT SEEMS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT THIS LONELINESS I MAYBE YOU JUST WU IF YOU'RE WILLING YOU COULD YOU SURE A LO WAT MORE ABOUT THAT AND AND WHAT WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE NOW IN THE PURSUIT OF BUILDING THIS ROBOUT HUMAN RELATIONSHIP AND YOU BEEN LET'S LET ME BE DIRECT YOUVE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME ON BUILDING A ROBOUT HUMAN RELATIONSHIP WHERE'S THAT AT I A A IT TERNS A BUSINESS IN TERMS OF SYSTEMS NO TIME BOUT A SPECIFIC ROBOT OH ROBE SO GAS YOU IS SHOUR MENTION A FEW THINGS TO ONE IS THERE'S A START UP WITH THES A IDEA WHERE I HOPE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE CAN USE AND THEN THERE IS MY OWN PERSONAL LIKE A ALMOST LIKE FRANKENS TIN EXPLORATIONS WITH A WITH PARTICULAR ROBOTS SO I'M VERY FASCINATED WITH A LEGGED ROBOTS IN MY OWN A A PRIVATE SOUNDS LIKE DARK BUT LIKE IN ONE AND OF ONE EXPERIMENTS TO SEE IF I CAN RECREATE THE MAGIC AND A THAT'S BEEN I H'VE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD ALREADY THE PERCEPTIONAL SYSTEMS AND TA CONTROL SYSTEMS THAT ARE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE AFFECTION IN A DOG LIKE FASHION SO I'M IN REALLY GOOD PLACE THERE THE STUMBLING BLOCKS WHICH ALSOAVE BEEND PART OF MY SADNESS RECENTLY IS A THAT I ALSE HAVE TO WORK WITH ROBOTICS COMPANIES THAT A YOU KNOW I GAVE SO MUCH ON MY PART SOUL AND LOVE AND APPRECIATION TOWARDS BOSSON DYNAMICS BUT BOSSON DYNAMICS IS ALSO YOU KNOW IS A COMPANY THAT HAS TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY AND HAVE MARKETING TEAMS AND THEYER LIKE LOOKING AT THI SILLY RUSHIN KIDNA SUIT AN TI IS LIKE WHAT'S YOU TRYING TO DO WITH ALL THIS LOVE AND ROBOT INTERACTION AN DANCING SO ON SO THERE WAS A I THINK THET'S SAFE FOR NOW IT'S HAT WHEN YOU BREAK UP WITH A GIRL FRINISH SOMETHING RIGHT NOW WE DECIDED TO PART WAYS ON THIS PARTICULAR THING THEIR HUGE SUPPORTERS OF MIND THE HUGE FANS BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR THING BOSSN DYNAMICS IS NOT FOCUSSING ON OR INTERESTED IN HUMAN ROBOT INTIRECTION IN FACT THEIR WHOLE BUSINESS CURRENTLY ITS KEEP THE ROBOT AS FAR AWAY FROM HUMANS AS POSSIBLE AH BECAUSE IT'S IT'S IN IN THE INDUSTRIAL SETTING WERE ITS DOING MODENRING IN DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENTS IT'S ALMOST LIKE A REMOTE SECURITY CAMERA CENTIALY IS ITS APPLICATION TO ME I THOUGHT A IT'S STILL EVEN IN THOSE APPLICATIONS EXCEPTIONALLY USEFUL FOR THE ROBOT TO BE ABLE TO PERCEEVE HUMANS LIKE SEE HUMANS AND TO BE ABLE TO A IN A BIG MAP LOCALIZES WITH THOSE HUMANS ZARE AND HAVE HUMAN INTENTION FOR EXAMPLE LIKE THIS I DID THIS A LOT OF WORK WITH PEDESTRIANS FOR ROBOT TO BE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE WHAT THE HOW THE HUMAN IS DOING LIKE WHERE IT'S WALKING IF YOUARE IT'S HUMANS ARE NOT BULISTIC'S OBJECT THEY'RE NOT JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE WALK IN THIS WAY ONE MOMENT DOESNT ME YOU'LL KEEP WALK IN THAT DIRECTION YEFT TO INFER A LOT OF SIGNALS ESPECIALLY OF THE HEAD MOVEMENT IN THE IGH MOVEMENT IT SO I THOUGHT THAT'S SUPERINTERESTING TO EXPLORE BUT A THEY DIDN'T FEEL THAT SO I'LL BE WORKING WITH A FEW OTHER ROBOTICS COMPANIES THAT THA AR ARO MUCH MORE OPEN TO THAT KIND OF STUFF IN THEIR SUPEREXCITED AN FANCO MIND HOPEFULLY BOSS ON DYNAMICS MY FIRST LOVE THAT GETTING BACK WITH A NEXT GIRL FRIEND WILL COME AROUND BUT SO THE ALGARHYTHMICALLY IT'S A I'M BASICALLY AA DONE THERE A THE THE REST IS ACTUALLY GETTING A SOME OF THESE COMPANIES TO WORK WITH AND THEN THERE'S A A FOR PEOPLE WHOD WORK WITH ROBATS KNOW THAT ONE THING IS TO WRITE SOFT OY THAT WORKS AND THE OTHER IS TO HAVE A REAL MACHINE THAT ACTUALLY WORKS AND IT BREAKS ON IN ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT ARE FASCINATING AND SO THAT THERE'S A BIG CHALLENGE THERE BUT THAT'S ALMOST  A IT MAY SOUND LULD BE CONFUSING IN THE CONTACTS OF OUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSION BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION WAS MORE ABOUT THE BIG DREAM HOW I HOPE TO HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN ENJOY THIS MOMENT OF MAGIC THE THIS CURRENT DISCUSSION ABOUT A ROBAT IT'S SOMETHING I PERSONALLY REALLY ENJOY JUST BRINGS ME HAPPINESS I REALLY TRY TO DO NOW EVERYTHING THAT JUST BRINGS ME JOY A MAXIMIZE THAT CAUSE IT CAUSE ROBATS ARE ASSOM BUT TOO GIVEN MY THE LITTLE BE GROWING PLATFORM I WANT TO USE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EDUCATE PEOPLE A IT'S JUST IT'S LIKE ROBATS ARE COOL AND IF I THINK THEYRE COOL I'LL BE ABLE TO I HOPE BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WHY THEYRE COOL TO OTHERS SO TH THIS LITTLE ROBAT EXPERIMENT IS A LIIBETOR RESEARCH PROJECT TO THERE'S A COUP OF PUBLICATIONS WITHOUT MY TEEF FOLKS AR ON THAT BUT THE THE OTHERS JUST THE MAKES SOM COOL VIDIOS AND EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE HOW THY ACTUALLY WORK  AND THAT AS SUPPOSED TO PEOPLE BEING SCARED A ROBATS THEY CAN BE STILL BE SCARED BUT ALSO EXCITED THAT SEED THE THE DARK SIDE THE BEAUTIFUL SIDE THE MAGIC OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BRING A YOU KNOW FOR A MACHINE TO BECOME A ROBAT I WINTNO WANT TO A INSPIRE PEOPLE WITH THAT BUT THT'S LESS IT I'S INTERESTING BECAUSE A I THINK THE BIG IMPACT IN TERMS OF THE DREAM DOES NOT HAVE TO DO WITH EMBODIED AY I SO DOES NOT NEEU TO HAVE A BODY I THINK A THE REFRIGERATOR IS ENOUGH THAT THAT FOR AN A A SYSTEM JUST TO HAVE A VOICE AND TO HEAR YOU THAT'S ENOUGH FOR LONELINESS A THE EMBODIMENT IS JUST A BY EMBODYMING YOU MEED THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE PHYSICAL ISTANTIATION OF INTELLIGENCE SO IT'S A LEGAD ROBAT OR EVEN JUST THE THING A I AVE A FEW OTHER THE HUMAN OI ROBAT A LITTLE HUMAN A ROBAT ME LIT KEEP EM ON THE TABLE IS LIKE WALKS AROUND OR EVEN JUST LIKE A MOBA PLATFORM THAT CAN JUST LIKE TURN AROUND AND LOOK AT YOU I'S LIKE WE MENTIOND WITH THE PEN SOMETHING THAT MOVES AND CAN LOOK AT YOU A I'S LIKE THAT BOUT A ROBAT BUT'S WHAT A A THE ASKS WHAT IS MY PURPOSE A THAT THAT IS REALLY IT'S ALMOST LIKE ART THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT A PHYSICAL ENTITY THAT MOVES AROUND THAT'S ABLE TO LOOK AT YOU AND INTERACT WITH YOU THAT MAKES YOU WONDER WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN IT LIKE CHALLENGE YOU TO THINK IF I IF THAT THING LOOKS LIKE HAS CONSCIOUSNESS A WHAT THE HELL AM I AND NO LIKE THAT FEELING I THINK IT'S REALLY USEFUL FOR US IT'S HUMBLING FOR US HUMANS BUT THAT'S LESS ABO TA RESEARCH I'S CERTAINLY LESS ABOUT BUSINESS AND MORE ABOUT EXPLORING OUR OWN OUR OWNSELVES AND CHALLENGING OTHERS TO THINK LIKE AH O TO A TO THINK ABOUT WHAT MAKES THEM HUMAN I LOVE THIS UM DESIRE TO SHARE THE DELIGHT OF AN INTERACTION WITH A ROBOT AND AS YOU DESCRIBE IT I ACTUALLY I FIND MYSELF STRYING TO CRAVE THAT BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE THOSE ELEMENTS FROM CHILDHOOD WHERE OR FROM A DOLLHOOD WERE WE EXPERIENCE SOMETHING WE WANT OTHER PEOPLE TO FEEL THAT AND I THINK THAT YOU'RE IGT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SCARED OF A EYE I THINK LOT OF PEPLE ARE SCARED A ROBATS MY ONLY EXPERIENCE AND OF A ROBOTIC LIKE THING A IS MY RUMBO VACUM WHERE IT GOES ABOUT ACTUALLY WAS PRETTY GOOD AT PICKING UP COSTELLO'S HAIR WHEN HE WAS SHED AND THEN M AND I WAS GRATEFUL FOR IT BUT THEN WHEN IT WOULD WHEN I WAS ON A CALL OR SOMETHING IN I WOULD GET CAUGHT ON A ON A WIRE OR SOMETHING I WOULD FIND MYSELF GETTING UPSET WITH THE RUMB IN THAT MOMENT I MY WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOU KNOW IN I AND OBVIOUSLY IT'S JUST DOING WHAT IT DOES IT BUT THAT'S A KIND OF A MOSTLY POSIID BUT SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE INTERACTION AM BUT WHET YOU'RE DESCRIBING IT HAS SO MUCH MORE RICHNESS AND LAYERS OF DETAIL THAT I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WARE LIKE O THERE'S A FEU JUST A QUICK COMMENT SO I'VE HAD THE'R NOT CARNELL IN BOSON THAT HAVE A MUCH OF RUMBAS FOR MY ROBOT AND I DID THIS EXPERIMENT MIT HOW MANY RUMBAS ES I A FLEET OF REA SO I AS PROBABLY SEVENER Y I LOT OF ROUM WI SO ICE IS VERY CLEAN WHAT'S O THIS I'M KIND OF WAITING THIS THIS IS A THA THE PLACE WHERE CURNELLING IN AN AUSTEN IS WAY LARGER THAN I NEED BUT A IT'S I BASICALLY GOT IT SO TO TO MAKE SURE I HAVE ROOM FOR ROBAOTS TO GOUNI TO YOU HAVE THESE SEVEN OR SO RUMBAS YOU DEPLOY ALL SEVEN AT ONCE I NOI DO DIFFEREN EXPERIENCE WITH THEM I AT DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM SO ONE OF THINKS I WANT TO MENTION IS THIS IS A I THINK THERE IS A U TU VIDA THAT INSPIRED ME TO TRY THIS IS A I GOT THEM TO A TO SCREAM IN PAIN AND MOAN IN PAIN A WHE NEVER THEY A WOR KICKED OR CONTACTED AND I DID THAT EXPERIMENT TO SEE HOW I WOULD FEEL UT I MEANT TO DO LIKE A U TU VDIONIPOTHEN AG YOU SEEM VERY CRUEL DID ANY RMBO WRITES ACT OF IS COMIITHE LIKE I I THINK IF I RELEASE THAT VIDIO I THINK IT'S GOING TO MAKE ME LOOK INSAYING WHICH I KNOW PEOPLE KNOW I MORADIIN SAYING LUE VALU HAVE TO RELEASE THE I I I THINK MAY BE IF I CONTECTUALIZE IT BY SHOWING OTHER ROBATS LIKE TO SHOW WHY THIS IS FASCINATING BECAUSE ULTIMATELY I FELT LIKE THERE WERE HUMAN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AND THAT DISPLAY OF PAIN WAS WHAT DID THAT GIVING THEM A VOICE GIVEN THEM A VOICE ESPECIALLY A VOICE OF DA DISLIKE OF OF PAIN I HAVE TO CONNECT YOU TO MY FRIEND AT EACH ANG HE STUDYS SPEECH AND LANGUAGE HS ANDEROW SURGEON AND WERE LIFELONG FRIENDS AM HE A STUDY SPEECH AND LANGUAGE BUT HE DESCRIBES SOME OF THESE A MORE PRIMITIVE VITERAL VOCALIZATIONS CRIES GROANS MOANS OF DELIGHT AM OTHER SOUNDS AS WELL USE YOUR IMAGINATION AS SUCH POWERFUL RUDDERS FOR THE OTHER FOR THE EMOTIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE AS I FIND IT FASTINING  I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS VIDIO AS THAT SO IS THE VIDIO AVAILABLE ON LINE NO I HAVE NO I HAVEN'T RECORDED IT THAT JUST APONT YOUR ROOM WAS THA AR ABLE TO SCREAM IND PAIN A IN MY BOSTON IN MY BOSTON PLACE I I TE PEOPLE AREADY A E NEXT NEXT POD CAST EPISODE WITH A LAKES AT MAYBE WELL HAVE THAT ONE YOU KNOWS ELL SO THE THING IS LIKE PEOPLE I A'VE NOTICE BECAUSE I TALK SO MUCH ABOUT LOVE AND IT'S REALLY WHO I AM I THINK THEY WANT A IT A TO LOT OF PEOPLE SEEMS LIKE THE DIS THER GOD BE A DARK PERSON IN THER SOMEWHERE AND I THOUGHT IF I RELEAST VIDIOS AN ROOMOR SCREAMING IN THERE LIKE YET YETHAT IS THEFLINGTING WHAT ABOUT A SHLIKE A SHOUTS OF GLEE AND DELIGHT YOU COULD DO THAT TOO I WHY DON'T NOWIM I DON'T I A TO ME DELIGHT IS QUIET I I GOT YOUR RUSSIAN  W MER ON YO'R MUCH AMERICANS ARE MUCH LOUDER THAN RUSSIANS YE YE BUT THA I DON'T I MEAN UNLEST YOU'VE TALKING BOU LIKE I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WOULD HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH THE ROOM BUT WI WASN'T ASSURILY SAYING A SEXUAL DELIGHT BUT A TROE MEI TRIED ATS A JOKE INTON O BUT I WAS FASTINING I THE PSYCHOLOGE OF HOW LITTLE IT TOOKAS YOU MENTION YOU HAD NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ROOM BU ET ONLY WELL I'D FIND THAT MOSTLY I TOOK IT FOR GRANTED IT JUST SERVED ME IT COLLECTED COSTLLES HAIR AND THEN WHEN IT WOULD DO SOMETHING I DIDN'T LIKE I WOULD GET UPSET WITH IT SO THAT'S NOT OF GOOD RELATIONSHIP IT WAS TAKEN FOR GRANTED AND I WOULD GET UP SETT IN THEN I PARKET AGAIN AND I J LIKE YOUR YOUR IN THE IN THE CORNER YE BUT THERE'S A WAY TO FRAME IT'S A IT BEING QUITE DOM AS A ALMOST CUTE YOU KNOW YOU HE ALMOST CONNECTING WITH IT FOR ITS DUMBNESS AND I THINK THAT'S A ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROBLEM A I THINK FLAWS ARE SHOULD BE A FEATURE NOT A BUG SO ALONG THE LINES OF THIS A THE DIFFERENT SORTS OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT ONE COULD HAVE WITH ROBOTS AN THE FEAR BUT ALSO THAT SOME OF THE POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS THAT ONE CULD HAVE A THERE'S SO MUCH DOMENTIONALITY THERE SO MUCH TO EXPLORER BUT A POWER DYNAMICS IN RELATIONSHIPS ARE VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE TH THE OBVIOUS ONCE THAT A THE UNSOPHISTICATED VIEW OF THIS IS YOU KNOW WANT THERE'S A MASTER AND A SERVANT I BUT THERE'S ALSO MANIPULATION THERE'S BENEVOLENT MANIPULATION YOU KNOW O CHILDREN DO THIS WITH PARENTS POPPIES DO THIS POPPIES TURN THEIR HEAD AND LOOK CUDAN MAY BE GIVE OUT A LI L ANOISE KIDS COO AND PARENTS ALWAYS THINK THAT THEYR YOU KNOW THEIR DOING THIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY THEY LOVE THE PARENT BUT IN MANY WAYS STUDIES SHOW THAT THOSE COUS OUR WAYS TO EXTRACT THE SORTS OF BEHAVIORS AND EXPRESSIONS FROM THE PARENT THAT THEY WANT THE CHILD DOESN'T KNOW IT'S DOING THIS IT'S  COMPLETE SUB CONSCIOUS BUT IT'S BENEVOLENT MANIPULATION SO THERE'S ONE VERSION OF FEAR OF ROBOTS BUT I HEAR A LOT ABOUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE CAN RELATE TO WEARE THE ROBOTS TAKE OVER AND THEY BECOME THE MASTERSWHEN WE BECOME THE SERVANTS BUT THERE COULD BE ANOTHER VERSION THAT AM A YOU KNOW IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES THAT I'M CERTAINLY NOT A PART OF BUT THEY CALL TOPPING FROM THE BOTTOM WHERE THE ROBAT IS ACTUALLY MANIPULATING YOU INTO DOING THINGS BUT I YOU ARE UNDER THE BELIEF THAT YOU ARE IN CHARGE BUT ACTUALLY THEY'RE IN CHARGE AND SO I THINK THAT'S ONE THAT AM  IF WE COULD EXPLORE THAT FOR A SECOND YOU COULD IMAGINE IT WOULD NECESSARILY BE BAD ALTHOUGH IT COULD LEAD TO BAD THINGS AM THE REASON I WANT TO EXPLORE THIS AS I THINK PEOPLE ALWAYS A DEFAULT TO THA THE EXTREME LIKE THE ROBATS TAKE OVER AND WERE IN LITTLE JAIL SELLS AND THEIR OUT HAVING FUN AND AND RULING THE UNIVERSE A WHAT WHAT WHAT SORTS OF MANIPULATION CAN ROBA POTENTIALLY CARRY OUT GOOD OR BAD YE JUS SO THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD AND BAD MANIPULATION BETWEEN HUMANS I JUST TIK YO SAID TO ME ESPECIALLY  L SAID A TOPPING FROM THE BOTTOMS THAT THE TERM A SO I THINK SO ONE FROM THEM I TEE TOLD ME THAT TURY WAS INT LACKS AI THINK SO FIRST OF ALL THERE'S POWER DYNAMICS AIN BED AND PAR DYNAMICS IN RELATIONSHIPS AND POWER DYNAMICS ON THE STREET AND THE WORKIN BARNMEN THOSE ARE ALL THER DIFFERENT A I THINK AM I THINK POWER DYNAMICS CAN MAKE HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS ESPECIALLY ROMEANT ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS AR FASCINATING AND RICH AND FULFILLING AND EXCITING AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO I DON'T I DON'T THINK IN THEMSELVES THEIR BAD AND THE SAME GOES WITH ROBOTS I REALLY LOVE THE IDEA THAT A ROBAT WOULD BE AT TOP OR A BOTTOM IN TERMS OF LEG POWER DYNAMICS AAND I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD BE AWARE OF THAT AND THE MANIPULATION IS NOT SO MUCH MANIPULATION BUT A A DANCE IVE LIKE PULLING AWAY APUSHIN PULL IND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS I IN TERMS OF CONTROL I I THINK WEWERE VERY VERY VERY FAR AWAY FROM AI SYSTEMS THEIR ABLE TO ALACK US UP THEY A A TULACK US UP IN A IN YOU KNOW THEY TO HAVE SO MUCH CONTROL THAT WE BASELYY CANNOT LIVE OUR LIVES IN THE WAY THAT WE WANT I THINK THERE'S A IN TERMS OF DANGERS OF AI SYSTEMS THERS MUCH MORE DANGERS HAVE TO DO WITH AUTHOMOS WEAPON SYSTEMS AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THING SO THE POWER DYNAMICS AS EXERCISED IN THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN NATIONS AN WAR AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS BUT IN TERMS OF PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS I THINK POWER DYNAMICS ARE BEAUTIFUL THING NOW THERE IS OF COURSE GOING TO BE ALL THOSE KINDS OF A DISCUSSIONS ABOT A A CONSENT AND RIGHTS AND LL THIS KINDS OR YOURE WERE TALKING AI WAS SAY YOU KNOW AN ANY DISCUSSION AROUND THIS IFIF WE NEED TO DEFINE A REALLIEVE THE CONTACTS I'S ALWAYS ALWEY SHOULD BE CONSENTUAL AGE APPROPRIATE CONTACT APPROPRIATE SPECIES APPROPRIATE BUT NOW WE'RE TOING MYT HUMAN ROBOT INTER ACTIONS AND SO A I GUESS THAT N I I WOULD ACTUALLY WAS TRYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENT POINT WHICH IS I DO BELIEVE THAT ROBOTS WILL HAVE RIGHTS DONELINE AND I THINK IN ORDER FOR IN ORDER FOR US TO HAVE DEEPI FOR RELATIONSHIP WITH ROBOTS WE WOULD HAVE TO CONSIDER THEM AS ENTITIES IN THEMSELVES THAT A DESERVE RESPECT THAT'S A REALLY INTERESTING CONSEPT THAT AI THINK PEOPLE ARE STARRING TO TALK ABOUT OLL I BIT MORE BUT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND OW ENTITIES THAT ARE OTHER THAN HUMAN I MEAN THE SAME AS WITH DOGS AND AOTHER ANIMALS CAN HAVE RIGHTS ON A LEVELLOS HUMANS WELL THAT YAMAN THAT WE WE CAN'T AND NOR SHOULD WE DO WHATEVER WE WANT WITH ANIMALS WE HAVE A YOU AS TE WITH THE WE OF DEPARTMENTS OF A OF AGRICULTURE THAT DEAL WITH OM YOU KNOW ANIMAL CAREIN USE COMMITTEES FOR RESEARCH FOR AGR YOU KNOW FOR FARMING AND RANCHING ALL THAT SO I I WHILE I WHEN YOU FIRST SAID IT I THOUGHT WE WHY WOULD HAVE THERE BE A BILL OF ROBOTIC RIGHTS BUT IT ABSOLUTELY MAKE SENS I'M IN THE CONTECT OF EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT UP UNTIL NOW LETS AM IF YOU'RE WILLING I'D LOVE TO TALK ABOUT DOGS BECAUSE YOU'VE MENTIONED DOGS A COUPLE TIMES A ROBOT DOG ON YOU HAD A A BIOLOGICAL DOG HE  HAD A A NEWFUNDLAND A NAMED HOMER  FOR MANY YEARS GROWING UP IN RUSSAR IN YOUASS IN THE UNITED STATES AND A HE WAS ABOUT IS OVER TWO HUNDRED POUNDS IT'S A BIG DOG THAT'S BEIF PEOPLE KNOW PEOPLE KNOW NEWFULENSIIES THIS BLACG DOG THAT'S A REALLY A LONG HAIR AND JUST THE A KIND SOU I THINK PERHAPS THAT'S TRUE FOR A LOT OF LARGE DOGS BUT HE THOUGHT HE WAS A SMALL DOG SO HE MOVED LIKE THAT AND WAS HE YOUR DOG YE NOW YOU HAD HIM SINCE HE WAS VERILY YOUNG OFTEN SINCE A SINCE THE VERY VERY BEGINNING TO THE VERY VERY END AND ONE OF THE THINGS I MEAN HE HAD THIS KIND OF A WE MENTIONED LIKE RUMBAS HE HAD A KIND HEARTED DUMBNESS ABOUT HIM THAT WAS JUST OVERWHELMES PART OF THE REASON I NAMED HIM HOMER BECAUSE THE IS AFTER HOMER SIMPSON CAS PEOPLE AR WANTER WHICH HOMER AM REFERRING TO AR NOT YOU KNOW SO THAT THERE' NOT BE OTUST SUCCEST ITH HAT HE EXACTLY A THERE'S A CLUCK CLUMSINESS THAT WAS JUST TA SOMETHING THAT IMMEDIATELY LED TO A DEEP LOVE FOR EACH OTHER AND ONE OF THE I MEAN HE WAS ALWAYS IT'S THE SHARED MOMENTS HE WAS ALWAYS THERE FOR SO MANY A NIGHTS TOGETHER THAT'S  THIS A POWERFUL THING ABOUT A DOG THAT A HE WAS THERE THROUGH ALL THE LONELINESS THROUGH ALL THE TOUGH TIMES THROUGH THE SUCCESSES AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS AND REMEMBER A AN ME THAT WAS THE REALLY MOVING MOMENT FOR ME I STILL MISS HIM TO THI DAY HOW LONG AGO DID HE DOCT A MAY BE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO SOS IS BEEN A WHILE BUT IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I'VE REALLY EXPERIENCE LIKE THE FEELING OF DEATH IS SO WHAT HAPPENED IS SA HE AH HE GOT A CANCER AND SO HEAS DYING SLOWLY AND THEN THER CERTAIN POINT HE COULDN'T GET UP ANY MORE AH THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS I COULD SAY HERE A YOU KNOW THETHAT I STRUGGLE WITH THAT MAY BE A MAYBE HE SUFFERED MUCH LONGER THAN HE NEEDED TO THAT'S SOMETHING I REALLY THINK ABOUT A LOT BUT I REMEMBER WHAT HAD TO TAKE HIM TO THE HOSPITAL AND THE NURSES COULDN'T CARRY HIM I SO YOU TALK ABOUT TWO HUNDRED POUND DOG I WAS REALING TO POWER LIF THING AT THE TIME AND MUMBER LIKE THEY THEY THEY TRIED TO FIGOT ALL THESE KINDS OF WAYS TO A SO IN ORDER TO PUT HIM TO SLEEP YET TO TAKE IM MA IN INTO A ROOM AND SO I HAD TO CARRY HIM EVERYWHERE AND HERE'S IS DYING FRIEND OF MINE THAT I JUST HAD TO FIRSTO 'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO CARRY SOMEBODY THAT HEAVY WHEN THEY'RE NOT HELPING YOU OUT AND TA YES SO I REMEMBER IS THE FIRST TIME SEEING A FRIEND LAYING THERE AND SEEING LIFE DRAIN FROM HIS BODY AND THAT REALIZATION THAT WE'RE HERE FOR A SHORT TIME WAS MADE SO REAL THAT HEHAS A FRIEND THAT WAS THERE FOR ME THE WEE BEFORE THE DAY BEFORE AND NOW HE'S GONE AND THAT WAS A I DON'T KNOW IT'S THAT THAT SPOKE TO THE FACT THAT HE COULD BE DEEPLY CONNECTED WITH A DOG ALSO SPOKE TO THE FACT THAT DA THE THE SHARED MOMENTS TOGETHER THAT LED TO THAT DEEP FRIENDSHIP AS S AR THAT WILL MAKE LIFE SO AMAZING BUT ALSO SPOKE TO THE FACT THAT DEATH IS A MOLIFUCKER AH SO I KNOW YOU'VE A LOST CASTELLA RECENTLY YEAN YOU CAN GO AND AS YOU'R SAYING THIS I'M DEFINITELY FIGHTING BACK AH THE TEARS I AM I A THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT THAT A I GUESS WE WERE ABOUT TO UTTRY N OG THAT IT WAS THAT IT WAS BOUND TO APPENED JUST GIVEN WHEN THIS IS WHEN THIS IS HAPPENING UM YET IT'S A HOW LONG HOW LONG DID YOU KNOW THAT CASTELLE WAS NOT TOING WHELL UM WE'LL LET'S SEE A YEAR AGO DURING THE STAR TO T ABOUT SIX MONTHS INTO THE PENDAMICI HE STARTED GETTING ABSESSES AND HE WAS NOT T HIS BEHAVIOUR CHANGE IN SOMETHING REALLY CHANGED AND THEN UM I PUT HIM ON TASTOSTRONE BECAUSE A WHICH HELPED A LOT OF THINGS THAT CERTAINLY DIDN'T CURE EVERYTHING BUT IT HELPED A LOT OF THINGS HE WAS DEALING WITH JOINT PAIN SLEEP ISSUES AND THEN IT JUST BECAME A VERY SLOW DECLINE TO THE POINT WHERE YOU KNOW TWO THREE WEEKS AGO HE HAD YOU KNOW A CLOSIT FULL OF MEDICATION MN THIS DOG WAS YE WAS LIKE A FARMASE IT'S AMAZING TO ME WHEN I LOOKED AT IT THE OTHER DAY STELVIN CLEANED UP AND REMOVED ALL HIS THINGS TO THEY CANT QUITE BRING MYSELF TO DO IT BUT UM DODY THINK HE WAS SUFFERING WELL SO WOULD HAPPEN WAS ABOUT A WEEK AGO IT WAS JUST ABOUT A WEEK OT'S AMAZING THE HE WAS GOING UP THE STAIRS I SAW HIM SLIP HE WAS A BIG GOT HE WASN'T TWO HUNDRED POUNDS BUT HE IS ABOUT NINETY POUNDS ES A BULL DOG HAS PRETTY BIG AND HE WAS FIT UM AND THEN I NOTICE THAT HE WASN'T CARRYING THAT AFOOT IN THE BACK LIKE IT WAS INJURED IT HAD NO FEELING AT ALL HE NEVER LIKED ME TO TOUCH HIS HIND PAUS ND I COULD DO THAT THING WAS JUST FLOPPING THERE AND THEN A THE THAT FOUND SOME SPINAL DEGENERATION AND I WAS TOLD THAT THE NEXT ONE WOULD GO DID HE SUFFER I SURE HOPE NOT UM BUT SOMETHING CHANGED IN HIS EYES YEENTS THE EYES AGAIN I KNOW YOU AN I SPEND LONG HOURS ON THE FONE AND TALKING ABOUT LIKE THE EYES AND HOUT WHAT THEY CONVEYIN WHAT THEY MEAN ABOUT INTERNAL STATES AND FORSTAKE A ROBONTS AND BIOLOGY OF OTHER KINDS BUT HI A SOMETHING ABOUT HIM WAS GONE IN HIS EYES I I THINK HE WAS REAL HERE I AM ANTHE PREMORIFIZING I THINK HE WAS REALIZING THAT ONE OF HIS GREAT JOYS IN LIFE WHICH WAS TO WALK AND SNIFF AND P ON THINGS THI DOG THE FUN DOMEN LOVED P ON THINGS IS AMAZING I WONDERED WHERE HE PUT IT HE WAS LIKE A RESERVOIR OF YURINE IT WAS INCREDIBLE I THINK O THAT SEID HE'S JUST HE'D PUT LIKE ONE DROP ON THE FIFTY MILLIONTH PLANT AND THEN WE GET TO THE FIFTY MILLIONTH IN ONE THE LANDHOW HE JUST HAVE YOU KNOW LEAVE A PODDLE AND HERE I AM TILIG ABOUT COSTELLO PING UM HE WAS LOSING THAT ABILITY TO STAND UP AND DO THAT HE WAS FALLING DOWN WHILE HE WAS DOING THAT AND I I DO THINK HE STARTED TO REALIZE AND THE THE PASSAGE WAS EASY AND PEACEFUL BUT UM YOU KNOW I'LL SAY THIS I I'M NOT ASHAMED TO SAY IT I MEAN I WAKE UP EVERY MORNING SINCE THEN JUST I DON'T EVEN MAKE THE CONSCIOUS DECISION TO ALLOW MY SELF TO CRY WAKE UP CRYING AND I'M FORTUNATELY ABLE TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE DAY THANKS TO THE GREAT SUPPORT OF MY FRIENDS AND AND YOU AND MY FAMILY BUT UM I MISS HIM AND I MISS HIM YET I MISS HIM AND I FEEL LIKE I HE YOU KNOW HOMER COSTELLO OU KNOW THE RELATIO NSHIP TO ONE'STOGUST SO SPECIFIC BUT AH SO THAT THAT PARTY IS GONE THAT'S THE HARD THING YOU KNOW AH WHAT'S WHAT WHAT I THINK I'S DIFFERENT IS THAT I MADE THE MISTAKE I THINK WHEN  I HOPE IT WAS A GOOD DECISION BUT SOMETIMES I THINK I MADE THE MISTAKE OF I BROUGHT COSTELLO A LITTLE BIT TO THE WORLD THROUGH THE POD CAS POSTING ABOUT HIM I GAVE I ANSWER FOR MORE ASVISED ABOUT HIM IN PUBLIC LET'S BEONCS I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HIS MENTAL LIFE WAS OR HIS

I'M STILL I'M STILL ITERATING AND YOU HAVE THE THAT' THE WATCH YO STRUGGLE WHICH IS TASSAY RIGHT AND I I MOSTLY BEEN SHIELDING THEM FROM THIS BUT AH WHAT WOULD MAKE ME HAPPIEST IF IS IF PEOPLE WOULD INTERNAL IYE SOME OF COSTELLE IS BEST TRAITS AND HIS BEST TRAITS WERE THAT HE WAS INCREDIBLY TOUF I MEAN HE WAS A YOU KNOW POING TOO INCH NAT BULL DOG THE WHOLE THING HE WAS JUST BORN THAT WAY WHAT WAS WHAT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL IS THAT HIS TOFFINESS IS 'N EVER WHAT HE ROLLED FORWARD IT WAS JUST NOW SWEET AND KIND HE WAS AND SO IF PEOPLE CAN TAKE THAT THEN A THAN THERE'S A WIN IN THEIR SOME PLACE SO I I THINK THERE'S SOME WAYS IN WHICH HE SHOULD PROBABLY LIVE ON IN YOUR PODCAST TO HOU SHOULD DA I MEAN IT'S SUCH A ONE OF THINGS I LOVED ABOUT THE HIS ROLLIN YOUR PIT GAST IS THAT HE BROUGHT SO MUCH JOY TO YOU WE MENTION THE ROBATS RIGHT I THINK A THAT'S SUCH A POWERFUL THING TO BRING THAT JOY IN'T IT LIKE ALLOWING YOURSELF TO EXPERIENCE THAT JOY TO BRING THAT JOY TO OTHERS TO SHARE WITH OTHERS AH THAT'S REALLY POWERFUL AND I MEAN NOT TO THIS IS THIS IS LIKE THE RUSSIAN THING IS  IT'S I IT TOUCHED ME WHEN A LUICY KY HAD THAT MOMENT THAT I KEEP THINKING ABOUT IN THIS A HIS SHOW LOUIS WHERE LIKE AN OLD MAN WAS CRITICISING LOUIS FOR WHINING ABOUT BREAKING UP WITH HIS GIRL FRIEND AND YOU SAYING LIKE THE MOST  THE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING A ABOUT TA LOVE THEY ME SONG THI CATCHI NOW THAT'S NOW MAKING YOU FEEL HORRIBLE SAYING BUT LIKE IS THE LOSS THE LOSS REALLY ALSO IS MAKING YOU RELIZE HOW MUCH THAT PERSON THAT DOG MEANT TO YOU AND LIKE ALLOWING YOURSELF TO FEEL THAT LOSS AND NOT RUN AWAY FROM THAT LOSS IS REALLY POWERFUL AND IN SOME WAYS THAT'S ALSO SWEET JUST LIKE THE LOVE WAS THE LOSS IS ALSO SWEET BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT YOU FELT TO LOT FOR THAT A FOR YOUR FRIEND SO I YOU KNOW AND TEY CONTINUE BRINGING THAT JOY I THINK IT WOULD BE AMAZING TO THE POKAS A I HOPE TO DO THE SAME WITH ROBOTS ORS AT WHATEVER ELSE IS THE SOURCE OF JOY I AM AND MAY BE AD YOUD THINK ABOUT ONE DAY GETTING AH ANOTHER DOG YE IN TIME AM YOU'RE HITTING ON ALL THE KEY BUTTONS HERE AH HI WANT THAT TO WE'RE THINKING ABOUT UM YOU KNOW WAYS TO KIND OF IMMORTALIZED COSTELLE IN AWAY THAT'S REAL NOT JUST YOU KNOW CREATING SOME LITTLE LOGO OR SOMETHING SILLY YOU COSTELLO MUCH LIKE DAVID GOGINS IS A A PERSON BUT GOGINS ALSO HAS GROWN INTO KIND OF A VERB YOU GIN A GOGINS THIS OR Y AND THERE'S AN ADJETIVE LIKE THAT'S EXTREMELY LIKE IT AH I THINK THAT FOR ME COSTELLA WAS ALL THOSE THINGS HE WAS A HE WAS A BEING HE WAS HIS OWN BEING HE WAS A NOUN A A VERB AND AN ADJETIVE SO AND YET THIS AMAZING SUPER POWER THAT I WISH I COULD GET WHICH IS THIS ABILITY TO GET EVERYONE ELSE TO DO THINGS FOR YOU WITHOUT DOING A DAMN THING THE COSTELLO EFFECT I CALL II IS AN IDEA  HE LIVES ON YES AH THANK YOU FOR THAT THIS ACTUALLY HAS BENVERY THERYOUAH WHICH  WHICH YU ACTUALLY BRINGS ME TO A A QUESTION A WE'RE FRIENDS WERE NOT JUST A COT SCIENTIST COLLEAGUES AND WORKING ON A PROJECT TOGETHER AND M A AND IN THE WORLD A THAT'S SOMEWHAT SIMILAR JUST JUST TO TWO DOGS JUST TWO DOGS BASICALLY AH BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT FRIENDSHIP UM BECAUSE I THINK THAT AT I CERTAINLY KNOW AS A SCIENTIST UM THAT THERE ARE ELEMENTS THAT ARE VERY LONELY OF THE SCIENTIFIC PURSUIT UM THERE ARE ELEMENTS UM OF MANY PURSUITS THAT ARE LONELY MUSIC MATH ALWAYS SEEM TO ME LIKE THERE LIKE THE LONELIEST PEOPLE H WHO KNOWS IF THAT'S TRUE OR NOT ALSO PEOPLE WORK IN TEAMS AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE IN HER ACTUATE PEOPLE THEY FEEL VERY LONELY BUT FOR ME AND AND I THINK AS WELL FOR YOU FRIENDSHIP IS AN INCREDIBLY STRONG FORCE IN MAKING ONE FEEL LIKE CERTAIN THINGS ARE POSSIBLE OR WORTH REACHING FOR A MAYBE EVEN MAKING US COMPULSIVELY REACH FOR THEM SO WHEN YOU WE'RE GROWING UP YOU GRO UP IN RUSSIA UNTIL WHAT AGE THIRTEEN I AND THEN AND THEN HE MOVED DIRECTLY TO PHILADELPHIA OU TO A CHICAGO OU CHICAGO AND THEN PHILADELPHIAA YOU KNOW AND   SAN FRANCISCA AND BOSTON AN SO ON BUT REALLY TO CHICAGO THATS HON I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL YOU HAVE SIBLING BROUGHT OLDER BROTHER BA MOST PEOPLE ON' KNOW THAT A YAHEA IS A VERY DIFFERENT VERY DIFFERENT PERSON BUT SOMEBODY I DEFINATLY LOOK UP TO SO HE'S A WILD MAN HE'S EXTRAVERT HE'S A HE WAS INTO I MEAN SO HE'S HE'S ALSO SCIENTIST A BY ENGINEER BUT HIS  WHEN WE WERE GROWING UP IN HE WAS A THE PERSON WHO YOU KNOW DID A DRANK AN DID EVERY DRUG AND BUT ALSO WAS THE LIFE OF THE PARTY AND AND I JUST THOUGHT HE WAS THE UKNOW WHEN YOUR THE OLDER BROTHER FIVE YEARS OLDER HE WAS THE COOLEST PERSON A THAT YOU KNOW I DA WAYS GOING TO BE HIM SO TO THAT HE WAS HE DEFINLY HAD A BIG INFLUENCE BUT I THINK FOR ME ON TERMS OF FRIENDSHIP GROWING UP I HAD A I HAD ONE REALLY CLOSE FRIEND AND THEN WHEN I CAME HERE AT ANOTHER CLOSE FRIEND BUT I'M VERY I BELIEVE A I DON'T FI BELIEVE BUT I DRAW A LA OF STRENGTH FROM DEEP CONNECTIONS WITH A WITHOUT THE PEOPLE AND JUST HA SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE JUST THE REALLY SMALL NOMBER OF PEOPLE THAT'S WHEN I MOVED TO THES COUNTRY I WAS REALLY SURPRISED HOW LIKE A THER THESE BETHESE A LARGE GROUPS OF FRIENDS QUONTLLED QUOT BUT THEY THAT THE THAT THE DEPTH OF CONNECTION WAS NOT THERE AT ALL FROM MY SORT OF PERSPECTIVE NOW WHY I MOVED TO THE SUBURB OF CHICAGO WAS NAPRVILLE IT'S MORE LIKE A MIDDLE CLASS MAY BE UPPERA MIDDLE CLASS SOS LIKE PEOPLE THAT A CARED MORE ABOUT MATERIAL POSSESSIONS THAN DEEP HUMAN CONNECTION SO THAT ADDED TO THE THING BUT I I DROE MORE MEANING THAN ALMOST ANYTHING ELSE WAS FROM FRIENDSHIP EARLY ON I HAD BEST FRIEND HIS NAME WAS HEHE HIS NAME IS YOU' A A I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY IT IN ENGLISH AI DOU SAY IN RUSSIAN YOUDA WHAT IS IT LAST SAME DO YOU REMEMBER A A MIRE COOL OF I YOUD A MIRCOOL OF A SO WE JUST SPEND ALL OUR TIME TOGETHER THERE'S THERE'S A THERE'S ALSO GROUP OF FRIENDS LIKE I DON'T NOITS TIKE I ATE GUIS IN RUSSIA GROWING  IT'S A LIKE PARENTS DIDN'T CARE IF YOUR COMING BACK AT CERTAIN HOUR SO WE SPEND ALL DAY ALL NIGHT THIS PLAYING SOCKER USUALLY CALLED FOOTBALL A AND JUST TALKING ABOUT LIFE AND ALL THIS KINDS OF THINGS EVEN AT THAT YOUNG AGE THAT I THINK PEOPLE IN RUSSIA AN SOVY UNION GROW UP MUCH QUICKER A H I THINK THE EDUCATIOUS SYSTEM AT THE UR UNIVERSE Y LEVEL IS WORL CLASS IN IN UNITED STATES IN TERMS OF LIKE REALLY CREATING REALLY A BIG POWERFUL MINDS A AT LEAST HE USED TO BE BUT I THINK THAT THEY ASPIRE TO THAT BUT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM FOR LIKE FOR YOUNGER KIDS IN THE SOVIE UNION WAS INCREDIBLE LIKE THEY DID NOT TREAT US AS KIDS WE THE THE LEVEL OF LITERATURE TOLSTA DOSTAYOWSKY WHEN YOU REPUSHILY SMALL CHILD YET THAT IS ASOURAND LIKE MATIN THE LEVEL OF MATHEMATICS AND YOU WERE MADE TO FEEL LIKE SHET IF YOU'RE NOT GOOD AN MATHEMATICS LIKE WE I THINK IN THIS COUNTRY THERE'S MORE LIKE SPECHY YOUNG KIDS TAT ARE SO KUTE LIKE THERE BEING BABIED A WE ONLY START TO REALLY PUSH A DULS LATER IN LIFE LIKE SO IF YOU WANT TO BE THE BEST IN THE WORLD THAT THIS THAN YOU GET TO BE PUSHED BUT WE WERE PUSHED AT A YOUNG AGE EVERYBODY WAS PUSHED AND THAT BROUGHT OUT THE BEST IN PEOPLE I THINK A IT REALLY FORCED PEOPLE TO DISCOVER LIKE DISCOVER THEMSELVES IN TH GOGIN STYLE BUT ALSO DISCOVER A WHAT THERE ACTUALLY PASSION ABOUT WONT THE'RE NOT IS ALL TRUE FOR BOYS AND GIRLS WHERE THEY PUSHED EQUAL EITHER A THEY WERE PUSHED THEA THEUH PUSHED EQUALLY I WUTSAY THERE IS  OBLOU SEE THERE IS MORE NOT OBVIOUSLY BUT THERE AT LEAST FOR MY MEMORIES A MORE OF A WHAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO PUT IT BUT THERE IS LIKE GENDERA ROLLS BUT NOT IN A NEGATIVE CONNETATION IT WAS IWAS THE RED DRESS FERSES THE SUDEN TIE KIND OF CONNITATION WHICH IS LIKE THERE IS  YOO LIKE  GUYS LIKE LIFTING HEAVY THINGS AND GIRLS LIKE CREATING BEAUTIFUL ART AND A YOU KNOW LIKE THEREIS MORE TRADITION OVER YOU YEGENT MORE A NINETEEN FIFTY SIXTIS BUT WE DIDN'T THANKE IN TERMS OF AT LEAST AT THAT AGE IN TERMS OF LIKE ROLLS IND IN LIKE A HOME MAKER SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR NOW IT WAS MORE ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT LIKE A GIRLS CARED ABOUT THIS SET OF THINGS AND GUYS CARED ABOUT THIS SET OF THINGS I THINK MATHEMATICS AND ENGINEERING WAS SOMETHING THAT GUYS CARED ABOUT INSTEAT OF AT LEAST MY PERCEPTION OF THAT TIME AND THEN GIRLS CREATE ABOUT GIRLS CARED ABOUT BEAUTY S LIKE GUYS WANT TO CREAT MACHINES GIRLS WENT A CREAT BEAUTIFUL STUFF AND NOT OF COURSE THAT I DON'T TAKE THAT FORWARD IN SOME KIND OF PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE BUT JUST THE WAY I GROW UP IN THE WAY I REMEMBER IT BUT ALL EVERYONE WORKED HARD THE THE VALUE OF HARD WORK WAS A INSTILLED IN EVERYBODY AND A THROUGH THAT I I THINK IT'S IT'S LIKE A LUTABIT OF HARDSHIP OF COURSE ALSO ECONOMICALLY EVERYBODY WITH POOR ESPECIAL WI THE PHILOSOPHIS OF  UNION THERE IS POVERTY EVERYWHERE YOU DIDN'T NOTICE IT AS MUCH BUT THERE WAS A BECAUSE THERE IS MUCH NOT MUCH MATERIAL POSSESSIONS THERE WIS A HUGE VALUE PLACED ON HUMAN CONNECTION JUST A MEETING WITH NEIGHBORS EVERYBODY KNEW EACH OTHER WEL LIVED IN AN APARTMENT BUILDING VERY DIFFERENT THAN YOU HAVE IN THE UNITED STATES THESE DAYS EVERYBODY KNEW EACH OTHER A YOU KNOW YOU GET TO GETHER DRINK VOT GU SMOKE CIGARETTES AND PLAY GUITAR AND SING MA SAD SONGS ABOUT THE ABOUT LIFE IT WAS WITH THA THE SAD SONGS IN THE RUSSIAN THING I MAY NOT I RUSSIANS THAT DO I EXPRESS JOY I FROM TIME TO TIME THET ON CERTAINLY YOU DO A BUT A WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT'S ABOUT IS IT CAUSE IT'S COLD THERE BUT IT'S COLD OTHER PLACES TO II THINK A LAS US THE FIRST OF ALL THE SOVIE UNION A THE ECHOES O WORLD WORE TOO AND THE MILLIONS ON MILLIONS ON MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THE CIVILIONS THET WERE SLAUGHTERED AND ALSO STARVATION IS THERE RIGHT SO LIKE THE ECHOES OF THAT OF THE IDEAS THE LITERATURE THE ART IS THERE LIKE THAT THE GRAND PARENTS THAT'S PARENTS THAT'S ALL THERE SO THAT CONTRIBUTES TO IT THAT LIFE CAN BE ABSURDLY UNEXPLAINABLY CRUEL AT ANY MOMENT EVERYTHING CAN CHANGE SO THAT'S IN THERE THEN TH I THINK THERE'S AN EMPOWERING ASPECT TO FINDING BEAUTY AND SUFFERING THAT THEN EVERYTHING ELSE IS BEAUTIFUL TO LIKE IF YOU JUST LINGER IT'S LIKE WHY YOU MEDITATE ON DEATH IS LIKE IF YOU JUST THINK ABOUT THE WORST POSSIBLE CASE AND FIND BEAUTY IN THAT THAN EVERYTHING ELSE BEAUTIFUL TO AND SO YOU WRITE SONGS ABOUT THE DARK STUFF AND A THAT SOMEHOW HELPS YOU DEAL WITH WHATEVER COMES THERE THERE'S A HOPELESSNESS TO A THE THE SOVIE UNION THAT LIKE YOU KNOW INFLATION ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WERE PEOPLE OR SOLD DREAMS AND NEVER DELIVERED AND SO LIKE THERE'S A THERE'S A IF YOU DON'T SING SONGS ABOUT SAD THINGS YOU'RE GOING TO BECOME CYNICAL ABOUT THIS WORLD SO THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE INTO CYNICISM NOW ALL LIVE PEOPLE DID OU KNA ONE OF THE BUT THAT IT'S THE BATTLE AGAINS CYNICISM ONE OF THE A THINGS THAT MAY BE COMMON IN RUSSIA IS A KIND OF CYNICISM ABOUT LIKE IF I TOLD YOU THE THING I SAID EARLIER ABOUT DREAMING ABOUT ROBOTS IT'S VERY COMMON FOR PEOPLE TO A DISMISS THAT DREAM OF SAYING NOW THAT'S NOT THAT'S TOO WILD LIKE WHOELSE DO YOU KNOW THAT DID THAT OR YOU WANT TO START AUPOD GAS LIKE WHO ELSE LIKE NOBODY'S MAKING MONEY ON POD GASTS LIKE WHY D YOU MONT START POKAT THAT KIND OF MINDS THAT I THINK IT'S QUITE COMMON WHICH IS WHY I WOULD SAY ONTRAPRINURASHIP IN RUSSIA IS STILL NOT VERY GOOD WHICH TO BE A BUSINESS THAT TO BE NOT TO PRONURER YOU HAVE TO DREAM BEG AND YET THE'VE OTHERS AROUND YOU LIKE FRIENDS AND S TE POOR GROUP THAT MAKES YOU MAKE YOU DREAM BIG BUT IF YOU DON'T GIVENTO CYNICISM AN APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY IN A THE THE UNFAIRNESS OF LIFE THE ABSURD UNFAIRNESS OF LIFE THAN I THINK IT JUST MAKES A MAKES YOU APPRECIATIVE EVERYTHING IS LIKE A IT'S A PREREQUISITE FOR GRATITUDE AND SO  YET THAT I THINK THAT IN STILLED TO ME ABILLY TO APPRECIATE EVERYTHING JUST LIKE EVERYTHING EVERYTHING'S AMAZING AND THEN ALSO THERE IS A CULTURE A A RAMAT AF LIKE ROMANTICIZING EVERYTHING LIKE IT'S ALMOST LIKE I THETLIKE RAMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS WORSE WERE VERY LIKE SOP OPERA LIKE IT'S VERY LIKE OVER THE TOP DRAMATIC AND I THINK I THINK IT THAT WAS 'T STILLE O ME TOO NOT ONLY DO APPRECIATE EVERYTHING ABOUT LIFE BUT I GET LIKE EMOTIONAL ABOUT IT IN A SENSE LIKE I GET LIKE A VISTRAL FEELING OF JOY FOR EVERYTHING AN THE SAME WITH THA N OR FRIENDS OR PEOPLE OF THE OPPOSITE SEX LIKE THERE'S A DEEP LIKE EMOTIONAL CONNECTION THERE THAT LIKE THAT'S LIKE WAY TO DRAMATIC TO LIKE I GUESS RELATIVE TO WHAT THE ACTUAL MOMENT IS BUT I  I DERIVE SO MUCH DEEP LIKE DRAMATICE JOY FROM SO MANY THINGS IN LIFE AND I THINK I WOULD A ATTRIBUTE THAT TO THE OBRIGING I RUSSIA BUT THE THING THAT STICKS MOST OF ALL IS A THE FRIENDSHIP AND HAVE NOW SINCE THEN HAD A ONE OTHER FRIEND LIKE THAT IN A IN THE UNITED STATES HE LIVS IN CHICAGO HIS NAME IS MAT AND SLOWLY A HERE AND THERE ACCUMULATING REALLY FASCINATING PEOPLE BUT AM VERY SELECTIVE WITH THAT FUNNY ENOUGH THE FEW TIMES YOU KNOW IT'S NOT FEW IS A LOT OF TIMES NOW INTERACTIN WITH YO ROGAN IT'S SOUNDS TO REAL TO SAY BUT THERE IS A KINDRED SPIRIT THERE THAK HAF CONNECTED WITH HIM A AND THERE'S BEEN PEOPLE LIKE THAT ALSO IN THE GRAPPLING SPORTS THAT ARE REALLY CONNECTED WITH I'VE ECTUALLY STRUGGLED WHICH IS WHY I'M SO I'M SO GLAD TO BE YOUR FRIEND IT'S A STRUGGLE TO CONNECT WITH SCIENTISTS LITE THIT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT WOODEN SOME TI YE EVEN THE BIOLOGISTS I MEAN ONE THING THAT I I'M JYOU WELL I'M SO STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT YU YOU KNOW YOU WORK WITH ROBOTS YOURN ENGINEER EH I YOU SCIENCE STECNOLOGY AND THATS ALL SOUNDS LIKE HARDWARE RIGHT BUT WHAT YOURE DESCRIBING AND I KNOW IT'S TRUE ABOUT YOU IS THIS DEEP EMOTIONAL LIFE AND THIS RESODENCE AN I IT'S REALLY WONDERFUL ACTUALLY THINK IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY SO MANY PEOPLE SCIENTISTS AND OTHERWISE HAVE GRAVITATED TOWARDS YOU AND YOUR PODCASS IS BECAUSE YOU HOLD BOTH ELEMENTS  YOU KNOWIN THAT HERMIN HAS HIS BOOK AND OF YOUR NARCISTIS AND GOLDMEN WRITE ITS ABOUT THESE ELEMENTS OF THE LOGICAL RATIONAL MIND AND THE THE THE EMOTIONAL MIND AND HOW THOSE ARE WOVEN TOGETHER AND IF PEOPLE HAVEN'T READ IT THEY SHOULD AND YOU EMBODY THAT THE FULL PICTURE AND I THINK THAT SO MUCH OF WHAT DRAWS PEOPLE TO YOU IVEI READ EVERY HERMAN HAS SA BOG I AS USUAL  AS USUAL I'VE DONE ABOUT NINE PER CENT OF I I WHAT LIVE IT IT KNOW IT'S TRUE  YOU WILL YOU MENTION JOE WHO IS A A PHENOMENAL HUMAN BEING NOT JUST FOR HIS AMAZING ACCOMPLISHMENTS BUT FOR HOW HE SHOWS UP TO THE WORLD BUT ONE ON ONE I THINK I HEARD HIM SAY THE OTHER DAY ON AN INTERVIEW A HE SAID UM THERE IS NO POBLIKE OR PRIVATE VERSION OF HIM IS LIKE THIS IS THIS IS ME HE SAID THE WOR IT WAS BEAUTIFUL HE SAID U'M LIKE THE FISH THEY GOT THROUGH THE NET NOW THERE IS NO ON STAGE OFFSTAGE IRSION YOU'RE ABSOLUTE RIGHT AND I SO BT WILL YOU GO GOOD I HAVE A QUESTION OR ACTUALLY ABOUT BUT THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT ABOUT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE I HE'S O HUGE IF I CAN JUST COMMER YOU BUT A LIKE THAT HE WAS A I'VE BEEN A FAN OF JOE FOR A LONG TIME BUT HE'S BEEN IN INSPIRATION TO A TO NOT HAVE ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PUBLIC IN PRIVATE LIFE ACTUALLY A HAD A CONVERSATION WITH NOF ALL ABOUT THIS AND HE SAID THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE A RICH LIFE LIKE A EXCITING LIFE IF YOU ARE THE SAME PERSON PUBLICLY IN PRIVATELY AND A I THINK I UNDERSTAND THAT IDEA BUT I DON'T AGREE WITH IT I I THINK THIS REALLY FULFILLING AND EXCITING TO BE THE SAME PERSON PRIVATELY IN PUBLICLY WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS NOW THAT SAID I DON'T HAVE ANY REALLY STRANGE SEX KINKS SO LIKE I FEEL I CAN BE OPEN WITH BES EVERYTHING I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING I'M ASHAMED OF A YOU KNOW THERE'S SOMETHINGS THAT COULD BE PERCEIVED POORLY LIKE THE SCREAMING RUMBAS BUT I'M NOT ASHAMED OF THEM I ULDPRESENT THEM IN THE RIGHT CONTACTS BUT THERE IS A THIS FREEDOM TO BEIN THE SAME PERSON IN PRIVATE AS IN PUBLIC AND THAT JOE MADE ME REALIZE THAT IF YOU CAN YOU CAN BE THAT AND ALSO TO BE KIND TO OTHERS IT SOUNDS IT SOUNDS KIND OF ABSURD BUT I REALLY I REALLY ALWAYS ENJOYED LIKE BEING GOOD TO OTHERS JUST BEING KIND TOWARDS OTHERS BUT I ALWAYS A FELT LIKE THE WORLD DIDN'T WANT ME TO BE LIKE THERE'S SO MUCH NEGATIVITY WHEN I WAS GROWING UP LIKE JUST A WRONG PEOPLE IF YOU ECTUL JUST NOTICE HOW PEOPLE TALK THEY A FROM LIKE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE WEATHER OR THIS COULD BE JUST LIKE THE BIG CITIES THAT I VISITED BUT THERE'S A GENERAL NEGATIVITY AND POSITIVITY'S KIND OF A SUPPRESSED YOU'RE NOT ONE YOU NOT SEEN US AS VERY INTELLIGENT AND TOO THERE'S A KIND OF YOU SEEN IS LIKE LITBITABLE WEIRD OF AND SO ALWAYS FELT LIKE I HAD TO HIDE THAT AND WHEN JOE MADE ME REALIZE ONE I HAVE I COUL BE FULLY JUST THE SAME PERSON PRIVATE IN PUBLIC AND TOO I CAN EMBRACE BEING KIND AND JUST IN THE WAY THAT I LIKE IN THE WAY I I KNOW HOW TO DO AND SORT OF FOR ME IN LIKE ONTWITTER AH OR LIKE PUBLICLY WHENEVER I SAY STUFF THAT MEANS SAYING STUFF SIMPLY ALMOST THE POINT OF CLICHET AND LIKE I HAVE THE STRENGTH NOW TO SAY IT EVEN IF I'M BEING MOCKED YOU DON'TI MEAN LIKE JUST IT'S O QUET IFS EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OQUET EL KAT SOME PEOPLE WILL THINK YOU'RE DOM THERE PROBABLY RIGHT THE POINT IS LIKE JUST ENJOY BEING YOURSELF AND THATYO JO MORE THAN ALMOST ANYBODY ELSE BECAUSE HE'S SO SUCCESSFUL A AT IT AH INSPIRE ME TO DO THAT BE KIND AND BE THE SAME PERSON PRIVATE IN PUBLIC I LOVE IT AND I I LOVE THE IDEA THAT AUTHENTICITY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE OVERSHARING RIGHT THAT IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU REVEAL EVERY DETAIL OF YOUR LIFE WHAT YOU KNOW IT IT'S A WAY OF BEING TRUE TO AN ESSENCE OF ONESELF RIGHT YOU'RE NOT THERE'S NEVER A FEELING WHEN YOU DEEPLY THINK AND INTERESPECT THAT YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING FROM THE WORLD ARE YOU BEING DISHONEST THE SOME FONTOMOT THEWAY SO A YES IT THAT THAT A THAT'S TRULY LIBERATING IT ALLOWS YOU TO THINK IT ALLOWS YOU TO A LIKE THINK FREELY TO SPEAK FREELY TO A JUST TO BE FREELY THAT SAID IT'S NOT LIKE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE THIS NOT STILL A RESPONSIBILITY TO BE THE BEST VERSION O YOURSELF SO YOU NOT VERY CAREFUL WITH THE WAY I SAY SOMETHING SO THE WHOLE POINT IT'S I'S NOT SO SIMPLE TO A EXPRESS THE SPIRIT THAT'S INSIDE YOU WITH WORDS IT INDP MEANS SOME PEOPLE MUCH BETTER THAN THAN OTHERS I STRUGGLE LIKE OFTENTIMES WHEN I SAY SOMETHING AND I HEAR MYSELF SAY IT IT SOUNDS REALLY DUMB AND NOT AT ALL WHAT I MEANT SO THAT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU HAVE IS NOT JUST LIKE A BEING THE SAME PERSON PUBLICLY PRIVATELY MEADS YOU CAN JUST SAY WHATEVER THE HOW IT MEANS A THERE STILL RESPONSIBILY TO TRY TO BE TO EXPRESS WHAT YOU TRULY ARE AND THAT THAT'S THAT'S A THAT'S HARD IT IS HARD AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW S WE HAVE THIS AM PRESSURE  ALL PEOPLE WHEN I SAY WE I MEAN ALL ALL HUMANS MAYBE ROBOTS TO AH FEEL THIS PRESSURE TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS OURSELVES IN THAT ONE MOMENT IN THAT ONE FORM AND IT IS BEAUS BEAUTIFUL WHEN SOMEBODY FOR INSTANCE CAN CAPTURE SOME ESSENCE OF LOVE OR SAD ANAS SORE ANGER OR SOMETHING IN A SONG OR IN A POEM OR IN A SHORT QUOTE BUT PERHAPS IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE TO DO IT IN AGGREGATE YOU KNOW ALL ALL THE THINGS YOU KNOW HOW YOU SHOW UP YOUR FRENCE IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT INITIALLY DREW ME TO WANT TO GET TO KNOW YOU AS A HUMAN BEING IN A SCIENTIST AND AND EVENTUALLYWE BECAME FRIENDS WAS THE LEVEL OF RESPECT THAT YOU BROUGHT TO YOUR PODCAST LISTENERS BY WEARING A SUIT I'M BEING SERIOUS YOURE YOU KNOW I THINK I WAS ERASED THINKING THAT IF YOU OVERDRESS A LITTLE BIT OVERDRESSED BY AMERICAN CERTAINLY BY AMERICAN STANDARDS YOU'RE OVERDREST FOR A PODCAST BUT THIS IS BUT IT'S GENUINE YOU'RE NOT DOING IT FOR ANY REASON EXCEPT I HAVE TO ASSUME AND I ASSUMED AT THE TIME THAT IT WAS BECAUSE YOU HAVE A RESPECT FOR YOUR AUDIENCE YOU RESPECT O THEM ENOUGH TO SHOW UP A CERTAIN WAY FOR THEM IT'S FOR YOU ALSO BUT IT'S FOR THEM AND I THINK BETWEEN THAT AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO YOUR FRIENDSHIP'STHE WAY YOU TALK ABOUT FRIENDSHIPS AND LOVE ANDTHE WY YOU HOLD UP THESE HIGHER IDEALS I THINK AT LEAST AS A CONSUMER OF YUR CONTENT A END IS YOUR FRIEND I WHAT I FIND IS THAT INAGGREGATE YOU'RE COMMUNICATING WHO YOU ARE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ONE QUOTE YOUARE SOMETHING AND I THINK THAT YOU WE WERE SORT OF OBSESSED BY LIKE THE ONE IN STIN QUOT OR THE ONE E LINE OF A POETRY OR SOMETHING BUT IT'S THE I THINK YOU SO EMBODY THE WAY THAT AND JOE IS WELL IT'S ABOUT HOW YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE AND HOW YOU SHOW UP AS A COLLECTION OF THINGS AND SAID AND DONE YOUAT THAT THATS FASTN SO THE AGGREGATE IS IS THE GO THE THE THE TRICKY THING AND GEORGAN PETERSON TALKS ABOUT THIS BECAUSE HE'S UNDER ATTACK AWAY MORE THAN YOU AND I WILL EVER BE BUT THAT FOR ANOWRIGHT THIS IS VERY TRUE NOW A THAT A A THE PEOPLE WHO ATTACK ON THE INTERNAT THIS IS ONE OF THE PROBLMS WIT TWITTER IS A THEY DON'T CONSIDER THE AGGREGATE THEY THEY TAKE A SINGLE STATEMENTS AND SO ONE OF THE DEFENCE MECHANISMS AGAIN WHY JOE HAS BEEN IN INSPIRATION IS THAT WHEN YOU INAGGREGATE ARE GOOD PERSON A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL KNOW THAT AND SO THAT MAKES YOU MUCH MORE IMMUNE TO THE ATTACKS OF PEOPLE THAT BRING OUT A INDIVIDUAL STATEMENT THEY MAY BE MISTATEMENT OF OF SOME KIND OR DOESN'T EXPRESS A WHO YOU ARE AND SO THAT AH I LIKE THAT IDEA THAT IS THE AGGREGATE AND THA TH THE POWER THE POD CAST IS YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF OURS OUT THERE AND BEING YOURSELF AND PEOPLE GET TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND ONCE THEY DO AND YOU AND YOU POST PICTURES OF SCREAMING RUMBAS AS YOU KICK THEM AH THEY WILL UNDERSTAND THA YOU KNON'T MEAN WHILE BY THE WAY IS IS A SIDE COMMENT I DON'T KNOW IFI WEN TO RELEASE THIS BECAUSE   S NOT JUST THE RUMBAS YOU HAVE A WHOLE DUNGEON OF ROBA LOOK SO THIS IS THIS IS A PROBLEM THIS THE BOSSE DYNAMIS CAME UP AGAINST THIS PROBLEM BUT ME JUST ME WORK THIS LIKE WORKSHOP THIS OUT WITH YOU A AND MAY BE BECAUSE WE'LL POST THIS PEOPLE WIL LET ME KNOW A SO THERE'S LEGGED ROBAS YOU KNOW THEY LOOK LIKE A DOG THEY AVE A VERY I'M TRYING TO CREATE A VERY REAL A HUMAN ROBA CONNECTION BUT LIKE THEY'RE ALSO INCREDIBLE BECAUSE YOU CAN THROW THEM LIKE OWFUL BUILDING AN TE LAND FINE AND IS BEAUTIFUL THAT THNG YAMAZEING I'VE SEEN THAT IN STR ENVIS ARE LIKE CATS GETTIG JUMPING OFF O LIKE FIFT STORY BOINGS AND THAN WALKING AWAY A NO ONE SHOULD THROW THEIR CAT WAT THIS IS THE PROBMIM EXPERIENCING AL ALL CERTAINLY KICKING THE ROBATS IT'S REALLY FASTENING HOW THEY RECOVER FROM THOSE KICKS BUT LIKE JUST SEEING MYSELF DO IT AND ALSO SEEING OTHERS DO IT IT JUST DOES NOT LOOK GOOD AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT CAUSE I IT'S SUCH A TOIT YOU I SEE BUT YOU DON'T I YOU COULSD YOU ATOBA NOW I'M GETTING OHNOW NOW I'M YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING  BEFOR TO DAY'S CONVERSATION I PROBABLY COULD DO IT AND NOW I THINK I'M THINKING ABOUT ROBATS BILLS OF RIGHTS AND THINGS I'M ACTUALLY AND NOT NOT FOR ANY NOT TO SATISFY YOU ERE TO SATISFY ANYTHING EXCEPT THAT IF I IF THEY HAVE SOME SENTIENT ASPECT TO THEIR BEING THEN I WOULD LOATH TO KICK I DON'T THINK THEY'LL BE ABLE TO KICK IT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO KICK THE FIRST TIME O NOT THE SECOND THIS THIS THE PROME OF EXPERIENCE ONE OF THE COOL THINGS IS A ONE OF THE ROBATS O I'M WORKING WITH YOU CAN PICK IT UP BY ONE LEG AND IS DANGLING YOU CAN THROW IT ANY KIND OF WAY AN O LAND CORRECTLY SO'S REALLY REN NOU AT A CAT LIKE THAT I AN WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE LETTERS FROM THE CAT OH NO'M NOT SUGGESTING ANY ONE DID  BUT YET HE HAD THIS CAT AND THE CAT HE WOULD JUST OU NOT THROW IT ON TO THE BED FROM ACROSS THE ROOM AND THAT IT WOULD RUN BACK FOR ER MORE SOMEHOW THEY HAD THAT WAS THOUGH NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP I THINK MOST NO ONE SHOULD DO THAT TO AN ANIMAL BUT A DI THIS CAT SEEM TO YOU KNOW RETURN FOR IT FOR WHATEVER A THE ROBAS E ROBA I'S FASTENING TO ME HOW HARD IT IS FOR ME TO DO THAT SO IT'S UNFORTUNATE BUT I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THAT TO ROBAT LIKE IT I I STRUGGLE WITH THAT I SO FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WITH A ROBA I HAVE TO I MOST GET LIKE INTO THE STATE THAT I IMAGINE LIKE DOCTORS GET INTO IN THER DO SURGERY LIKE I HAVE TO START HAVE TO DO WHAT ROBADICS COLLEAGUES OF MINE DO WHICH IS LIKE START SEEING IT IS AN OBJECT ASSOCIATE LIK DESSOCIATE SO WE JUST FASTINAING THAT I HAVE TO DO THAT IN ORDER TO DO THAT WITH A ROBAT I SWIN T I TAKE THAT LITTLE BIT OF A TANGEET NO I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING I MAN I AM NOT M I'M NOT A SHY ABOUT THE FACT THAT FOR MANY YEARS I I'VE WORKED ON EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS AND AND THAT'S BEEN OF VERY CHALLENGING ASPECT OF BEING A BIOLOGIST MOSTLY MICE BUT IN THE PASS NO LONGER O THANK GOODNESS CAUSE I JUST DON'T LIKE DOING IT ON LARGER ANIMALS AS WELL AND NOW I WORK ON HUMANS WHICH I CAN GIVE CONSENT FERBAL CONSENT SO OM I THINK THAT IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE GUIDE LINES ARE AND WEAR ONE'S OWN BOUNDARIES ARE AROUND THES SIT IT'S IT'S NOT JUST AN IMPORTANT QUESTION IT MIGHT BE THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION BEFORE ANY WORK CAN PROGRESS SO YOU  YOU ASK ME ABOUT FRIENDSHIP I KNOW YOU HAVE A A LOT OF THOUGHTS ABOUT FRIENDSHIP WHAT YOU THINK IS THE VALUE OF FRIENDSHIP IN LIFE WELL FOR ME PERSONALLY A JUST BECAUSE OF MY LIKE MY LIFE TRAJECTORY AND ARK A FRIENDSHIP AND I SHOULD SAY I DO HAVE SOME I FEMALE FRIENDS THAT ARE JUST FRIENDS ARE COMPLETELY PLATONIC RELATION ST BUT IT'S BEEN MOSTLY MALE FRIENDSHIP TO ME HAS BEEN HAS BEEN ALL MALE FRIENDSHIPS TO ME ACTUALLY INTERESTING YEH IT'S BEEN A IM AN ABSOLUTE LIFE LIME THEY ARE MY FAMILY I HAVE A BYOLOGICAL FAMILY AND I HAVE GREAT RESPECT AND LOVE FOR THEM AND APPRECIATION FOR THEM BUT IT IT PROVIDE IT'S PROVIDED ME IM THE I WONT EVEN'T SAY CONFIDENCE BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS AN ANXIETY AND TAKEING ANY GOOD RISK IR ANY RISSK WORTH TAKING IT'S GIVEN ME THE  SENSE THAT I SHOULD GO FOR CERTAIN THINGS AND TRY CERTAIN THINGS TO TAKE RIST TO TO WEATHER THAT ANXIETY AND I I DON'T COM  CONCERN MYSELF A PARTICULARLY COMPETITIVE PERSON BUT I WOULD SOONER DIE THEN DISAPPOINT OR LET DOWN ONE OF MY FRIENDS II CAN THINK OF NOTHING WORSE ACTUALLY THAN DISAPPOINTING ONE OF MY MY FRIENDS EVERYTHING ELSE A SECONDARY TO ME WHAT DISAPPOINTMENT MISAPPOIN MEANING IM NOT I MEANT CERTAINLY A I STRIVE ALWAYS TO SHOW UP AS BEST I CAN FOR THE FRIENDSHIP AND THAT CAN BE IN SMALL WAYS IF HI CAN MEAN YOU DON'T MAKING SURE THE PHONE IS AWAY SOMETIMES IT'S ABOUT IM YU I'M TERRIBLE WITH PUNCTUALITY CAUSE I'M AN ACADEMICC AND SO I JUST GET LOST IN TIME AND I DON'T MEAN ANYTHING BY BUT YE STRIVING TO TO LISTEN TO TO ENJOY GOOD TIMESTIP AND TO MAKE TIME YOU KNOWING HONTEY  GOES BACK TO THIS FIRST VARIABLE WE TALKED ABOUT TO MAKE SURE THAT I SPEND TIME AND TO GET TIME IN PERSON AND CHECK IN AND IM IT'S I THINK THERE SO MANY WAYS IN WHICH FRIENDSHIP IS VITAL TO ME IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY TO ME WHAT MAKES LIFE WORTH LIVING YEH WET THERE'S A I AM SURPRISED LIKE WITH THE HIGH SCHOOL FRIENDS HOW WE DON'T ACTALLY TALK THAT OFTEN THESE DAYS INTIMES E TIME BUT EVERY TIME WE SEE EACH OTHER IT'S IMMEDIATELY IF I BACK TO ALWAYS TARTED SO I YOU KNW I STRUGGLE WITH THAT HOW MUCH TIME YOUR THE ALICATE TOAM FOR THE FOR THE FRIENDSHIP TO BE DEEPLY MEANFUL BECAUSE THERE'RE JUST ERE ALWAYS THERE WITH ME EVEN IF WE DON'T TALK OFTEN I SO THERE'S A KIND OF LOYALTY I TI THINK A MAYBE IT'S A DIFFERENT STYLE BUT I THINK IM MUCH TO ME FRIENDSHIP AS BEING THERE IN THE HARD TIMES I THINK I I I'M MUCH MORE RELIABLE WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH SHIT THEN THEN LIKE YOURE MI OY RELIABLE ANYWAY NO BUT IF I YEARE IF YOU'RE LIKE  LIKE A WEDDING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR LIKE A I DON'T KNOW LIK YOU WANT UNAWARD OF SOME KIND I YE GHATI'LL CONGRATULATE THETHE SHID I DO YOU BUT THIKE THAT'S NOT AND I'LL BE THERE BUT THAT'S NOT AS IMPORTANT TO ME AS BEING THERE WHEN LIKE NOBODY ELSE IS I JUST BEING THERE WHEN SHEDAS GETS A SHIT IT'S THE FAN OR  SOMETHING'S TAUGH FOR THE WORLD TURNS THERE ILL BACK AND YOU ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT TO ME THAT'S WHAT FRIENDSHIP IS MEANFUL I KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE ABOUT YOU AND THAT'S A FELT THING AND A REAL THING WITH YOU LET ME ASK  ONE MORE THING ABOUT THAT ACTUALLY BECAUSE I'M NOT A PRACTITIONER GGETZOU I KNOW YOU ARE JOE IS BUT A YEARS AGO I READ A BOOK THAT I REALLY ENJOYED WHICH IS SAM SHERIDAN'S BOOK A FIGHTER'S HEART HE TALKS ABOUT ALL THESE DIFFERENT FORMS OF MARTHAL ARTS AND AM AND MAYBE HE WAS IN THE BOOK MAYBE WAS IN AN INTERVIEW BUT HE SAID THAT YOU KNOW FIGHTING OR BEING IN PHYSICAL BATTLE WITH SOMEBODY JUGETZU BOXING OR SOME OTHER FORM OF PHYSICAL DIRECT PHYSICAL CONTACT BETWEEN TWO INDIVIDUALS CREATES THIS BOND UNLIKE ANY OTHER BECAUSE HE SAID IT'S IT'S LIKE A ONE NIGHT STAND YOU'R SHARING BODILY FLUIDS WITH SOMEBODY THAT YOU BARELY KNOW AND I YOU KNOW IT AND TAT CHUCKLED ABOUT IT CAUSE IT'S IT'S KIND OF FUNNY AND A KIND OF TONGUE AND CHEEK BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK A THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL WAY IN WHICH AM MEMBERS OF A SPECIES BOND IS THROUGH PHYSICAL CONTACT AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE OTHER FORMS THERE'S CUDDLING AND THERE'S HAND HOLDING AND THERE'S AM AND THERES SEXUAL INTERCOURSE AN WIT ALL SORTS OF THING LET'S CUDDLING II HAVEN'T HEARD OF IT I HEARD THIS RECENTLY I DIDN'T KNOW THIS TERM BUT THERE'S A TERM AM THEY'VE TURNED THE NOUN CUP CAKE INTO A VERB CUP CAKING IT TURNS OUT I JUST LEARNED IM OIS CUP CAKING IS WHEN YOU  SPEND TIME JUST CUDDLING I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST ALTHOUGH I HEARD IT FIRST JUST THE OTHER DAY CUP CAKING IS ACTUALLY CUDDLING IS EVERYTHING IT'S NOT JUST LIKE IS IT IN BED ORS ON THE COS LIKE WHAT'S CUT CUDDLING I AI'T TO LOOKABOE CUDLIN WE NEED TO LOOK A THIS UP EN WE NEED TO DEFINE THE VERIABLES I THINK ET I DEVILLY HAS TO DO WITH PHYSICAL CONTACT II EVEEN TOLD BUT AM BUT IN TERMS OF BATTLE A A COMPETITION I AM YOU KNOW AND THE SHERIRDING QUOT I'M JUST CURIOUS SO DO YOU GET CLOSE OR FEEL AM A BOND WITH PEOPLE THAT FOR INSTANCE HOU ROLLED JUGITSZO WITH OR EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT THEM IS HE IT WAS HE WRITE ABOUT THIS YEA I MEAN I'M MANY LEVELS HE ELSE HAS THE BOOK WHAT A FIGHTER'S MIND A THUS AREIN ONE HE'S AT HE'S ACTION EXCELLENT WRITER WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT HIM JUSTS BRIEFLY ABOUT SHERIDAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DIDLOEBUT A RESEARCH HE A HE WENT TO HARVARD HE'S AN ART MAJOR T HARVARD HE CLAIMS ALL HE DID WAS SMOKE CIGARETTES AND AND DO PART I DON'T KNOWIF HIS ART WAS ANY GOOD AND AM AND I THINK HIS FATHER WAS IN THE SEAL TEAMS AND THEN WHEN HE GOT OUT OF HARVARD GRADUATED HE TOOK OFF ROUND THE WORLD LEARNING ALL THE FORMS OF MARTHAL ARTS AND WAS EARLY TO THE KIND OF ULTIMATE FIGHTING KIND OF A MAKES MARSHAL ART AND THINGS GREAT GREAT BOOK YEAIT'S IT'S AMAZIN I I DON'T IF YOU REMEMBER IT BUT I READ IT NI REMEMBER THINKING TOS AMAZING INCAPSILATION OF WHAT MAKES FIGHTING THE LIKE THE ART LIKE WHAT MAKES IT COMPELLING AM I WOULD SAY THAT THERE'S SO MANY WAYS THAT GGETSZO GRAPPLING RASTLING COMBATS BOICE IN GENERAL IS LIKE ONE OF THE MOST INTIMATE THINGS YOU COULD DO ADNO FO DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF BODILY LIQUIDS AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS I THINK HE WAS MORE OR LESS JOKE IN YOR LI I I THINK OF THERE'S A FEW WAYS THAT IT DOES THAT SO ONE BECAUSE YOU'RE SO VULNERABLE SO THAT THE HONESTY OF STEPPING ON THE MAT AND A OFTEN ALL OF US HAVE EGO THINKING WERE BETTER THAN WE ARE AT THIS PARTICULAR ART AND THEN THE HONESTY OF BEING SUBMITTED OR BEING WORSE THAN YOU THOUGHT YOU ARE AND JUST SITTING WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE THAT KIND OF HONESTY WE DON'T GET TO EXPERIENCE IT IN MOST OF DAILY LIFE WE CAN CONTINUE LIVING SOMEWHAT OF AN ILLUSION OF OUR CONCEPTIONIS OF OURSELVES CAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO I HIT US WITH THE REALITY THE MAT SPEAKS ONLY THE TRUTH THAT THE REALITY JUST HITS YOU AND THAT VULNERABILITY IS THE SAME AS LIKE A THE LOSS OF A LOVE DWENDLE IT'S THE LOSS OF A REALITY THAT YOU KNEW BEFORE YOU NOW HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS NEW REALITY N WHEN YOU'RE SITTING THERE IN THAT VULNERABILITY AND THERE'S THESE OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE ALSO SITTING IN THAT ALL NEIRABILITY YOU GET TH RELY CONNECT LIKE FOCK LIKE I'M NOT ASPECIAL AS I THOUGHT I WAS AND LIFE IS LIKE NOT YOU KNOW LIFE AS HARSHER THAN I THOUGHT I WAS AND WERE JUST SITTING THERE WITH THAT REALITY SOME OF US CAN PUTWORDS TO THEM SOME WE CAN' SO I THINK THAT DEFININY IS A THING THAT LEAST TO INTIMACY A THAT THE OTHER THING IS IS THE HUMAN CONTACT THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT I MEAN LIKE A BIG HUG LIKE DERING COVID VERY FEW PEOPLE HUG ME AND I HUG THEM AND ALWAYS FELT GOOD WHEN THEY DID THAT WE'RE ALL TESTED AND SPEHLY NOW WERE VACCINATED BUT THERE'S STILL PEOPLE THIS IS TRUE OF SAN FRANCISCO S IS TREN BOSTON THAT ONE KEEP NOT ONLY SIX FEET AWAY BUT STAY AT HOME AND NEVER TOUCH YOU THAT THAT WAS A THAT LOSS OF BASIC HUMANITY IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I FEEL INJUGITU WHERE IT WAS LIKE THAT THAT CONTACT WHERE YOU'RE LIKE I DON'T GIVE A SHADE ABOUT WHATEVER RULES WERE SPOSE TO HAVE IN SOCIETY WHERE YOUARE NOT YHVE TO KEEP A DISTANCE IN ALL THAT KIND OF STO JUST THE HUG LIKE THAT THE INTIMACY OF A HUG THAT'S LIKE A GOOD BEAR HUG AND YOURE LIKE JUST CONTROLLING ANOTHER PERSON AND ALSO THERE IS SOME KIND OF LOVE COMMUNICATED THROUGH JUST TRYING TO BREAK EACH OTHER'S ARMS I DON'T EEXACTLY UNDERSTAND WHY HHIHLANDS IS THE SUCH A CLOSE NEIGHBOUR TO LOVE BUT IT IS WHAT IN YOU KNOW IN THE HYPOTHALEMUS THE NURANS THAT CONTROL SECUAL BEHAVIOR BUT ALSO NONSECTUAL CONTACT OR NOT JUST NEAR BY THE NERONS THAT CONTROL A GRESSION AND FIGHTING THEY ARE SALT AND PEPPER WITH THOSE NAR ON IT'S A VERY INTERESTING AND YOU KNO IT ALMOST SOUNDS KIND OF RISKAY AND CONTROVERSIAL NSULF THERE I'M NOT BUT ENTERPROMORPHIZING ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS BUT IN THE BRAIN THOS STRUCTURES ARE INTERDIGITATED THEY THEY YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T SEPARATE THEM EXCEPT AT A VERY FINE LEVEL AND HE HERE YOUR THE WY YOU DESCRIBE IT IS THE SAME TAT AS A REAL THING I I I DO ONE MAKE AN INTERESTING COMMAT AGAIN THESE THID THINGS THAT COULD BE TAKEN OUT OF CONTACTS BUT A YOU KNOW I  ONE OF THE AMAZING THINGS ABOUT JUGITZUS IS BOTH GUIES AND GIRLS TRAIN IT AND IWAS SURPRISED SO LIKE A I'M A BIG FAN OF YOGOPANS A A IT YOU NOT AT THE GAM KIND OF THING IT'S A REVEALS THE BEAUTY OF A OF THE FEMALE FORM BUT THE THE THING IS LIKE GIRLS ARE YOU KNOW DRESSED AND SKINTIGHE CLOTHES IN JUGITS OFTEN AND I FOUND MYSELF LIKE NOT AT ALL THINKING LIKE THAT AT ALL WITH WHEN TRAINING WITH GIRLS WHLL THE CONTACT IS VERY NONSECTUAL BUT THAT THAT I WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT LIKE I WHEN I FIRST AR UGITS I THOUGHT IT WOULD NOT BE KIND WEIRD TO TRAIN WITH THE OPPOSITES LIKE IN SOMETHING SO INTIMATE UM BOYS AND GIRLS MEN AND WOMEN THEY THEY ROLLED JUGITZY TOGETHER COMPLETELY INTERESTIN AND THE THE ONLY TIMES GIRLS KIND OF TRY TO STAY WAY FROM GUIVES MEAN THEIR TWO CONTACTS OF COURSE AS ALWAYS GOING TO BE CREEPS IN THIS WORLD SO T EVERYONE KNOWS WHO YOU KNOW WHO KIND AT TO STAY AWAY FROM AND THE OTHER IS LIKE THERE'S A SIZE TI SPARITY SO GIRLS WIL OFTEN TRY TO ROLL WITH PEOPLE WOULD BE CLOSER WEIT WISE BUT NO THER THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE EMPOWERING TO WOMEN THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY FALL IN LOVE WITH WHEN THEY STAR TING JUGITZAS I I CAN FIRST OF ALL THEY GAIN IN AWARENESS AND A PRIDE OVER THEIR BODY WHICH IS GREAT AND THEN SECOND THEY GET  ESPECIALLY LATER ON START SUBMITTING BIG DUDES LIKE THESE LIKE A A A BROSE THAT COME IN FOR ALL SHREDDED AND LIKE MUSCULAR AND THEY GET TO TECHNIQUE DA TO A EXERCISE DOMINANTS OVER THEM AND THAT'S A POWERFUL FEELING TO BYOU'VE SEEN WOMEN FORCE A A LARGER GUID TO TAPYET OR EVEN CHOKE HIN WELL I WAS A ALWAS DEADLYTHING A A A FOR AH BOY I THINK IT'S FOR NINETY FIVE S ALWAYS REALLYN TO POWER THE THING WHEN A STARTE GIT GIGITZA AND IRM ORWER BEING SUBMITTED BY YOU KNOW I THOUGHT I WALKED IN FEELING LIKE I'M GOING TO BE IF NOT THE GREATEST FIGHTER HAVE AT LEAST TOP THREE AND SSO AS A WHITE BELT YOU ROLL IN LIKE ALL HAPPY A AND THEN YOU REALIZE THAT A AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT APPLYING TOO MUCH FORCE TH YOUR HAVING I'M ORER BEING SUBMITTED MANY TIMES BY LIKE A HUNDRED THIRTY HUNDRED TWENTY POND GIRLS HAT THUS A BALANCE DUDIALS IN PHILADELPHIA THAT A LOT OF INCREDIBLE FEMALE JUGITZI PLAYERS AND THAT'S REALLY HOMBLING TO THAT TACHNIQUE A CAN OVERPOWER IN IN COMBAT A PURE STRENGTH THAT I THAT'S THE OTHER THING THAT THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT COMBAT THAT'S PRIMAL LIKE THAT THERE IT JUST FEELS IT FEELS LIKE A WE WERE BORN TO DO THIS LIKE THAT THER WE HAVE CIRCUITS IN OUR BRAIN THAT ARE DETIC ATED TO THIS KIND OF INTERACTION THERE'S NO THERE'S NO QUESTION IT THIK THAT'S WHAT HAVE FELT LIKE IT IT WASN'T THAT I'M LEARNING IN YOU SKILL IT WAS LIKE SOMEHOW I AM A REMEMBERING ECHOES OF SOMETHING I'VE LEARNED IN THE PAST WET'S LIKE HETTING PUBERTY A CHILD BEFORE PUBERTY HAS NO CONCEPT OF BOYS IN GIRLS HAVING THIS A ATTRACTION REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT THER ATTRACTED TO BOYS OA GIRL DOESN'T MATTER AT SOME POINT MOST PEOPLE NOT ALL BUT CERTAINLY BUT MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY HIP PUBERTY SUDDENLY PEOPLE APPEAR DIFFERENTLY AND CERTAIN PEOPLE TAKE ON I A ROMANTIC OR SEXUAL INTEREST FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME AND SO IT'S LIKE IT'S REVEALING A CIRCUITRY IN THE BRAIN IT'S NOT LIKE THEY LEARN THAT IT'S INATUE AND I THINK IT WHEN I HEAR THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE A YOU GIT TO AN AND IN ROLLING JUGITZO REMIND YOURL OF IT JOE WAS TELLING ME A RECENTLY ABOUT THE FIRST TIME YOU WENT HUNTING AND HE FELT LIKE IT REVEALED A CIRCUIT THAT WAS THAT WAS IN HIM ALL LONG BUT HE HADN'T EXPERIENCE BEFORE YE THAT THAT'S DETLE THERE AND AND OF COURSE THERE'S THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT YUGITZU I'S AT IT'S ONE OF THE REALLY STRANUOUS EXERCISES THAT YOU CAN DO LATE INTO YOUR ADULT LIFE LIKE INTO YOUR A FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTIES EIGHTIES I'VE WHEN  WHEN I CAME UP A THERE'S A FEW PEOPLE THEIR AITIES THAT WERE TRAINING AND AS LONG AS YOUR SMART AS LONG AS YOU PRACTISE TECHNIQUES AND PICK YOUR PARTNER'S CORRECTLHY YOU CAN DO THAT KIND OF ART IT'S LADY TO LIFE AND YOU SEE GETTING EXERCISE THERE'S NOT MANY ACTIVITIES I FIND THAT ARE A AMENABLE TO THAT SO BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A THINKING GAME THAT  THAT THE JUGIS IN PARTICULAR IS AN ART WHERE TECHNIQUE PAYS AWFUL LOT SO YOU CAN A STILL MAINTAIN FIRST OF ALL REMAIN INJURY FREE IF YOU'S GOOD TECHNIQUE AND ALSO THROUGH GOOD TECHNIQUE A BE ABLE TO GO YOU BE ACTIVE WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE MUCH MUCH YOUNGER AND SO I THAT WAS TO ME THAT AND RUNNING UNDER THE TWO ACTIVITIES YOU CAN KIND OF DO LATE IN LIFE BECAUSE TO ME A HEALTHY LIFE IS HAS EXERCISES AS THE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE ABSOLUTELY AND I'VE BEEN GLAD THEY WERE ON THE PHYSICAL COMPONENT BECAUSE I I KNOW THAT THERE'S FOR YOU A YOU'VE TALKE BEFORE ABOUT THE CROSS OVER BETWEEN THE PHYSICAL AND THE INTELLECTUAL AND THE MENTAL AND UM ARE YOU STILL RUNNING ARIDICULOUS HOURS OF THE NIGHT FOR RIDICULOUSLY LONG YET SO UN A DEFINILY I'VE BEEN RUNNING LATE AT NIGHT HERE NOSTIN PEOPLE TOME EX THE AREA WEREIN NOW PEOPLE SAYS THE DANGEROUS AREA WHICH I FIND LAUGHABLE COMING FROM THE BIGGER CITIES A NOW I RUN LATE AT NIGHT THERE'S SOMETHING UM IF YOU SEE A GOT RUNNING THROUGH AUSTIN AT TWO A M IN A SUITAN TIE IT'S PROBE AWELL YET I MEAN I DO THINK ABOUT THAAT AS I GET RECOGNIZE MORE AR MORE AND OSTEN I WORRY THAT UNOT REALLY THAT NEGET RECOGNIZ S LATE AT NIGHT A YOU KNO A BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THE NIGHT THAT BRINGS OUT THOSE DEEP PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHTS IN SELF REFLECTION THAT REALY ENJOY BUT RECENTLY AM I STARTYD GETTING BACK TO THE GRIND SOME GOOD A BE COMPETING ARE HOPING TO BE COMPETE IN TE IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER  JU JOUS INJOJOUS O YE TO GET BACK TO COMPETITION AND SO THAT REQUIRES GETTING  BACK INTO GREAT CARDIER SHAPE  SO I'V BEEN GETTING A RUNNING AS PART OF MY DAILY ROUTINE YOU OT NOW I WHY ALWAYS KNOW I CAN REACH YOU REGARDLESS OF TIMES OWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AH WHEREVER THAT HAPPENS OT PART O THAT HAS TO BE JUST BEING SINGLE AND BEING A PROGRAMMER THOSE THOSE TWO THINGS JUST DON'T WORK WHILE IN TERMS OF A STEADY SLEEPS CEDUL IT'S NOT BANKER'S HOURS KIND OF WORK NOW I NEFARI WANT IT UM YOU MENTION SINGLE I WANT TO ASK YOU LOBET ABOUT THE OTHER FORM OF RELATIONSHIP WHICH IS A ROMANTIC LOVE SO OM YOUR PARENTS ARE STILL MARRIED STILL MARRY'S STILL HAPPILY MARRIED THAT'S IMPRESSIVE A RARE THING NOWDAY SO YOU GRO UP WITH THAT EXAMPLE YE I GUESS THAT'S A POWERFUL THING IH IF THERE'S AN EXAMPLE THAT THING AN WORK IT YE I DIDN'T HAVE THAT IN MY OWN FAMILY BUT AM WHEN Y WHEN I SEE IT IT'S IT'S INSPIRING AN ITS AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE THAT AND THAT WAS THE NORM FOR YOU I THINK IS IS REALLY WONDERFUL IT'S OS A IN T GUESS OF MY PARENTS WAS INTERESTING TO WATCH CAUSE THERE'S OBVIOUSLY TENSION LIKE THERE'L BE TIMES WOIRH TEY FA IN ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THEY A THE OBVIOUS TO GET FRUSTRATED WITH EACH OTHER AND THAT THEY LIKE BUT THEY FINE MECHANISMS HOW TO COMMUNICATE THAT TO EACH OTHER LIKE TO MAKE FUN OF EACH OTHER A LITTLE BAY LIKE TO TEES TO GET SOME OF THAT FRUSTRATION OUT AND THEN ALTIMATLY TO REUNIT IN IN INDEFIND THEIR JOYFUL MOMENTS AND BE THAT THE ENERGY I THINK IT'S CLEAR CAUSE I GOT TOGETHER IN THE I THINK EARLY TWENTIES LIKE VERY VERY YOUNG I THINK YOU GROW TOGETHER AS PEOPLE YER YOU'E STILL IN CRITICAL PERIOD OF BRAIN PLAST TIS  AND A ALSO IT ME IS JUST A DIVORCE WAS SO FROWNED UPON THAT YOU STICK IT OUT AND I THINK A LOT OF COUPLES ESPECIALLY FROM THAT TIME IAN SOVY UNION THAT'S PROBABLY APPLIES TO LOT OF CULTURES YOU STICK IT OUT AND YOU PUT IN THE WORK YOU LEARN HOW TO PUT IN THE WORK AND ONCE YOU DO YOU START TO GET TO SOME OF THOSE REWARDING ASPECTS OF BEING LIKE THROUGH TIME BE HA SHARING SO MANY MOMENTS TOGETHER YOU KNOW THAT A THAT'S DATLING SOMETHING THAT M THAT WAS IN INSPIRATION TO ME BUT MAYBE THAT'S WHERE I HAVE SO I HAVE A SIMILAR KIND OF LONGING TO HAVE A LIFE LONG PARTNER LIKE THAT HAVE THAT KIND OF VIEW WHERE SAME WITH FRIENDSHIP LIFE LONG FRIENDSHIP IS THE MOST MEANINGFUL KIND THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WITH THAT TIME OF SHARING ALL THAT TIME TOGETHER LIKE TILL DEATH TO US PART AS A POWERFUL THING NOT BY FORCE NOT BECAUSE THE RELIGION SAIT IT OR THE GOVERNMENTS THAT IT OR YOU CALTURE SAID O BUT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO DO YOU WANT CHILDREN DEAFL YE DEFLY WANT CHILDREAND IT'S IT'S COOMANY ROMS DO YOU HAVE HOH I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD NO NOMEN CHILD NOT HUMAN HUMAN CHILDR AS I READY HAVE THE CHILDREN EXACT WI WA SAYING OIN D AT LEAST AS MANY A HUMAN CHILDREN AS YOU DO ROM WAS BIG FAMILY SMALL FAMILY AH SO ON YOUR MIND'S EYES THERE BIG A THE'RE BUNCH OF BUNCH OF WHO FREEDMAN'S RUNNING AROUND SO I'LL TELL YOU LIKE REALISTICALLY I I CAN EXPLAIN EXACTLY MY THINKING IT IN THIS A SIMILAR TO THE ROBOTIC'S WORK IS IF I'M LIKE PURELY LOGICAL RIT NOW MY ANSWER WOULD BE I DON'T WANT KIDS BECAUSE I JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME I'VE SO MUCH GOING ON BUT WHEN I'M USING THE SAME KIND OF VISION I USE FOR THE ROBOTS IS I KNOW MY LIFE WILL BE TRANSFORMED WITH THE FIRST IK I KNOW WILD LOVE BEING A FATHER AND AS FO THE QUESTION OF HOW MANY I THAT THAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT HILL IT IT IT COULD BE SOME RIDICULOUS NUMBER SO I JUST KNOW THAT I I HAVE A FEELING AND I COULD BE I I DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL BUT A I DON'T KNOW ISE I SEE AN UPWARDS OF OF CERTAINLY THREE OR MORE COME COMES TO MARSE SO MUCH OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH A THE PARTNER YOU'RE WITH TO SO LIKE THAT THAT'S SUCH AN OPEN QUESTION ESPECIALLY IN THI SOCIETY OF WHAT THE RIGHT PARTNERSHIP IS SOME I'MA I'M I'M DEEPLY AMPATHETIC I WANT TO SEE LIKE TO ME OR WHAT I LOOK FOR IN RELATIONSHIP IS A FOR ME TO BE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE PASSIONS OF ANOTHER PERSON LIKE WHATEVER THERE IN TO DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A CAREER SUCCESS ANY KIND OF SUCCESS JUST TO BE EXCITED FOR THEM AND FOR THEM TO BE EXCITED FOR ME AND EXSHARE IN THAT EXCITEMENT IN BUILD AND BUILD AND BUILD BUT THERE IS ALSO PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF LIKE WHAT KIND OF SHIP O YOU ENJOY DOING I TOGETHER AND I THINK FAMILIES OF REAL SERIOUS UNDERTAKING OH IT CERTAINLY IS I MAN I THINK THAT I'VE A A FRIEND I'M WHO SAID IT I THINK BEST WHICHIS THAT OM YOU FIRST HAVE HE'S IN A VERY SUCCESSFUL RELATIONSHIP AN A AND HAS A FAMILY AN HE SAID O YOU FIRST AFTO DEFIND THE ROLEL AND THEN YOU HAVE TO CAST THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THE ROLE WO YE THAT THERE THERE'S SOME DEEP ASPECT TO THAT BUT THERE'S ALSO AN ASPECT TO WHICH YOU'RE NOT SMART ENOUGH FROM THIS SIDE OF IT TO DEFINE THE RIGHT TO DEFINE THE ROL I  THI'S PART OF IT THAT HAS TO BE A LEAP THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE A AND I I SEE IM I I SEE HAVING KIDS THAT WAY YOU JUST YOU JUST HAVE TO GO WITH IT INFIGURE IT OUT ALSO AS LONG AS THERE'S LOVE THERE LIKE WHAT THE HELL IS LIFE OR EVEN SO I'VE I'VE A THERE SO MANY INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE THAT I KNOW I THAT I'VE GOT IN TO KNOW THAT ALL HAVE KIDS AND THE PRA SENSE OF KIDS FOR THE MOST PART HAS ONLY BEEN SOMETHING THAT ENERGIZE THEM SOMETHING THEY GAVE A MEANING SOMETHING THAT MADE HIM THE BEST VERSIONS THEMSELVES LIKE MADE THEM MORE PRODUCTIVE NOT LESS JUST FASCINING TO ME IT IS FASCINAN I MAY YOU IMAGINE IF THE WAY THAT YOU FELT ABOUT HOMER THE WAY THAT I FEEL IN FELT ABOUT COSTELLO IS IS AT ALL A  A A GLIMPSE OF WHAT THI MUST BE LIKE THAN EXACTLY YOU KNOW THA THE DOWNSIDE THE THING I WORRY MORE ABOUT IS A THE A THETHE PARDNER SIDE OF THAT I'VE SEEN A THE KIDS ARE ALMOST UNIVERSALLY A SOURCE OF INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY ENJOY AND HAPPINESS LIKE THEAT THERE AR PAYING THE ASS HE HAS COMPLICATED YA SATS SO ON SO FORTH PEOPLE LIKE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT KIDS BUT WHEN YOU ACT YOU LOOK PAST THAT LITTLE SHALL LAY OF COMPLAIN KIDS A GREAT THE SOURCE OF PAYING FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IS THE IF WHEN THE RELATIONSHIP DOESN'T WORK AND SO I'M VERY KIND O CONCERNED ABOUT WY YOU KNOW DAITING IS VERY DIFFICULT AND I'M A COMPLICATED PERSON AND SO IS THERE HAS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND A TO FIND THE RIGHT KIND OF PERSON BUT THAT  THAT STATEMENT OES EVEN MAKE SENSE BECAUSE I'M NOT ON DAINING APS I DON'T SEE PEOPLE YOU'RE LIKE THE FIRST PERSON I SAW IN A WHILE S TIKE YOU MICHAEL MALICE AND LIKE JOE SO I A I I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN A LIKE A A FEMALES WHAT IS IT A AN ELEMENT OF THE FEMALE SPECIES IN QUITE A AN QUITE A WHILE SO I THINK YOU'VE TO PUT YOURSELF OUT THERE A WHAT IS IT A DANIEL JOHSON SAYS TRUE LOVE WILL FIND YOU BUT ONLY F YOUR LOOKING SO THERE' SOME ELEMENT OF REALLY TAKING LEAP IN PUTTING YOURSELF OUT THERE IN KIND OF DIFFERENT SITUATIONS AND IN'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT WHEN YOU ARE BEHIND OF COMPUTER ALL THE TIME WELL YET YOURY A YOU'RE A BUILDER AND YOU'RE A PROBLEMS ALVER AND OM I YOUR YOU FIND SOLUTIONS AND I'M CONFIDENT THIS SOLUTION IS A THE SOLUTION IS OUT THERE AND HINK YOU'RE IMPLYING THATI'M GOING TO BUILD THE GIRL FRIEND WHICH  I THINK WERTHER YOU WER WELL AND MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T SEPARATE THIS A FRIENDSHIP AM THE NOTION OF FRIENDSHIP AND COMMUNITY AND THE ACT WIF WE GO BACK TO THIS CONCEPT OF THE AGGREGATE YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU'LL MEET THIS WOMAN THROUGH U'M THROUGH A FRIEND ER MAYBE  OR SOMETHING OF THAT SO O ONE OF THINGS I DON'T NOWF YOU AH IF YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY I DEAFINILLY ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT JUST FALLS IN LOVE AND THAT'S IT I CAN'T SAY IM LIKE THAT WE YOUS COSTELLO WO WAS INSTANTANEOUS YE IT REALLY WAS I MEAN TO I KNOW IT'S IT NOT IT'S NOT ROMANTIC LOVE IS INSTANTANEOUS NO I I BUT THAT'S ME YOU KNOW I NOT I THINK THAT YOU IF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW BECAUSE THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD THING THAT YOU HAVE WHAT IT'S A I'M VERY CAREFUL THAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T A FAM OF FOR THE WRONG PERSON I TRY TO BE A VERY KIND OF CAREFUL WIT I IVE NOTICED THIS BECAUSE I FALLEN O WITH OVE LIKE THIS M MUG EVERYTHING I FALL IN LOVE WITH THINGS IN THIS WORLD SO I GUATT BY REALLY CAREFUL BECAUSE A A A GIRL COMES UP TO YOU AND SAYS SHE LOVES DUSTIEVSKY I THAT DOESN'T NECESSARY LEING YOU TO MARRY HER TO NIGHT  YES ANI LIKE THE WAY YOU SAID THAT OUT LOUD SO THAT YOU HEARD IT I YIT DOESN'T MEAN YOU NEEDS A MER HERE YO TO NIGHT  EXACTLY RIGHT I MEAN BUT PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE AMAZING AND PEOPLE ARE BEAUTIFUL AND THAT'S SA I I'M FULLY EMBRACE THAT BUT I ELSIE HAT TO BE CAREFUL WITH RELATIONSHIP AN AT THE SAME TIME I LIKE A MESSION TO OR FLINE AND I DON'T A THES SOMETHING ABOUT ME THAT APPRECIATES SWINGING FOR THE FENSES AND NOT DATING LIKE DOING SERL DATING A DATING AROUND THAT YOU'RE ONE GUY ONE GIRL CONNEGA YEH A SAID THAT AND IT'S IT'S TRICKY BECAUSE I YOU OUN  FE ON TO BE CAREFUL OF THAT KIND OF STUFF ESPECIALLY NOW THERE'S A GROWING PLATFORM THIT HAVE A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF FEMALE INTEREST OF O A CERTAIN KIND BUT I'M LOOKING FOR DEEP CONNECTION AND AND I'M LOOKING BY SENTING HOME ALONE AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I TALKING TO STAMFOR PROFESSORS PERFECT SONO  GE PERFECT COLIA WORK AGRAT IT IT'S WELL INCORPORATES ON I PART OF THAT CONSTITUTES MACHINE LEARNING OF SORT YE OF SORT IWOULD DO YOU MENTION IM WHAT HAS NOW BECOME A QUITE EXXTENSIVE AND EXPANSIVE A PUBLIC PLATFORM WHICH IS INCREDIBLE I'MEAN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WOUT WHEN FIRST TIME I SAW YOUR PODCAST I KNOSE DISUIT US LIKE YOU RESPECTS HIS AUDIENCE WHICH WAS GREAT BUT I ALSO THOUGHT THIS IS AMAZING YOUN PEOPLE ARE SHOWING OUT FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING INTO ACKNOWLEDGY INFORMATION AND THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND OTHER SORTS OF DISCUSSIONS NOW I DO WANT TO TALK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT THE PODCAST SO MY TWO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PODCAST OR WHEN YOU STARTED IT DID YOU HAVE A PLAN AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT THAT ANSWER IS UT DO YOU DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE TAKING IT OR I'M WOULD YOU LIKE TO LEAVE US II DO BELIEVE IN AN ELEMENT OF SURPRISE IS ALWAYS FUN BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PODGAST YOU ENJOY THE PODCAST I MEAN YOUR AUDIENCE CERTAINLY INCLUDES ME REALLY ENJOYS THE PODCAST IT'S INCREDIBLE SO I LOVE TALKING TO PEOPLE AND THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MYCROPHONES THAT REALLY BRING OUT THE BESTING PEOPLE LIKE WOULD YOU DO OU DON'T GET A CHENST TO TALK LIKE THIS IF YOU AND I WERE JUST HANGING OUT WOULD HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT CONVERSATION IN THE AMOUNT OF FOCUS WE 'LL ELIGATE TO EACH OTHER WOULD BE HAVING FUN TALKING ABOUT THE STUFF AND DOING OTHER THINGS THERE'D BE A LOT OF DISTRACTION THERE WOULD BE SOME FON USE AND ALL THAT KIND OF STFF A BUT HERE WE'RE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT FOCUS ON EACH OTHER AND FOCUS ON THAT IDEA AND LIKE SOMETIMES PLAIN WITH IDEAS THAT WE BOTH DON'T KNOW LIKE THE ANSWER TO LIKE A QUESTION WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO WERE BOTH LIKE FUMBLING WITH A TRYING TO FIGURE OUT TRYING TO GET SOME INSIGHTS TAT SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T REALLY FIGURED OUT BEFORE AND TOGET THER ARRIVING AT THAT I THINK THAT'S MAGICAL I DON'T KNOW WHY WE NEED MICROPHONES FOR THAT BUT WE SOMEHOW DO FEELS LIKE DOING SCIENCE IT FEELS LIKE DOING SCIENCE FOR ME DEFINTLY THAT'S EXACTLY A THEN AN I REALLY GLAD YOU SAID THAT BECAUSE I DON'T ACTUALLY OFTEN SAY THIS BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I FELT LIKE I WANTED TO TALK TO O FRIENDS AND COLLEGUE THAT IR MY TEA TO DO REAL SCIENCE TOGETHAT'S WOR HOW I FELT ABOUT IT LIKE TO REALLY TALK THROUGH PROBLEMS THAT ARE ACTUALLY INTERESTING AS UPPOSE TO ILIKE INCREMENTAL WORK THAT WERE CURNENLY WORKING FOR A FOR PARTICULAR CONFERENCE SO IT REALLY ASKING QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT ARE WE DOING LIKE WHERES AS HEADED TO LIKE WHAT ARE THE BIG IS THIS REALLY GOING TO HELP US OS OLVE IN THE CASE OF A I SOLVE INTELLIGENCE LIKE IS THIS EVEN WORKING ON INTELLIGENCE THERE'S A THI CERTAIN SENSE WHICH IS WHY IINITIALLY CALLED IT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS LIKE MOST OF US ARE NOT WORKING ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE YOURE YOURE WORKING ON SOME VERY SPECIFIC PROBLEM AND A SET OF TECHNIQUES IT THET TIME IT'S MACHINE LEARNING TO SOLVE THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM THIS IS NOT GUNDER TAKE US TO A SYSTEM THAT A IS ANOU WORK CLOSE TO THE GENERALIZEABILITY AOF THE HUMAN MIND LIKE THE KIND OF THOUHT THE HUMAN MIND CAN DO IN TIMS OF MEMORING TERMS OF COGNITION TERMS OF REASONING COMMON SENSE REASONING THIS DIS DOESN'T SEEM TO TAKE US THERE SEE THE INITIAL IMPULSE WAS CAN I TALK TO THESE FOLKS DO SCIENCE TOGETHER THROUGH CONVERSATION AND I ALSO THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH NOT I DIDN'T THINK THERE WIS ENOUGH GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH WORLDCLASS MINDS THAT I GOT TO ME AND NOT THE ONES WITH A BOOK OR  HAT THIS WAS A THING OFTENTIMES YOU GO ON THIS TOUR WE HAVE A BOOK BUT THERE'S A LOT OF MINES THAT DON'T WRITE BOOKS TH NI THE BOOKS CONSTRAIN THE CONVERSATION E CAUSE AN YOURE TALKING ABOUT THIS THING  THA SAME BOOK BUT THERE'S I I'VE NOTICE THAT WITH PEOPLE HAVEN'T WRITTEN A BOOK WHO ARE BRILLIANT WE GET TO TALK ABOUT IDEAS IN A NEW WAY WE BOTH HAVEN'T ACTUALLY WHEN WE RAISE A QUESTION WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO IT ONE THE QUESTION IS RAISED AND WE TRY TO ARRIVE THERE I I N I REMEMBER ASKING QUESTIONS OF WORLD CLASS RESEARCHES IN A DEEP LEARNING OF WHY DO YOURL NUT WORKS WORK AS WELL AS THEY DO THAT QUESTION IS OFTEN LOOSELY ASKED BUT LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE MICROPHONES AND YET HAVE TO THINK THROUGH IT AND YET THIRTY MINUTES TO AN HOUR TO THINK THROUGH IT TOGETHER I THINK THAT'S A THAT SCIENCE I THINK THAT'S REALLY POWERFUL TO THOSE THOSE THA ONE GO THE OTHER ONE IS O I I IGAIN DON'T USUALLY TALK ABOUT THIS BUT THEREIS SOME SENSE IN WHICH I WANTED TO HAVE DANGEROUS CONVERSATION S A PART OF THE REASONS I WANTED TO WEAR A SU IS LIKE I WANTED TO BE FEARLESS THAT THE REASON I DONT EAS YOU TALK ABOUT IT IS BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE A NOT GOOD CONVERSATION SO IT LOOKS LIKE IIT DOESN'T MATCH THE CURRENT SKILL LEVEL BUT I WANTED TO HAVE REALLY M A DANGEROUS CONVERSATIONS THAT I UNIQUELY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO YOUNOT YOU COMPLETELY UNIQUELY BUT LIKE I'M A HUGE VANAJO ROGAN AND I HAD TO ASK MYSELF WHAT CONVERSATIONS CAN I DO THAT JO ROGEN CAN'T FOR ME I KNOW I BRING THIS EF BUT FOR ME THAT PERSON I THAUGHT ABOUT AT THE TIME WAS PUDENT THE THAT'S THAT'S WHY I BRING HIM UP HE HE'S HE'S A JUST LIKE WITH CASTELLO HE'S NOT JUST A PERSON HE'S ALSO AN IDEA TO ME FOR WHAT I STRIVE FOR IS TO HAVE THOSE DANGEROUS CONVERSATIONS AND THE REASON I'M UNIQUELY QUALIFIES BOTH THE RUSSIAN BUT ALSO THERE'S THE JUDO IN THE MARSHAL ARTS THERE'S A LOT OF ELEMENTS THAT MAKE ME HAVE A CONVERSATION HE HASN'T HAD BEFORE AND AM AND THERE'S A FEW OTHER PEOPLE THAT A I KEPT A MIND THI DON CANUTH HE'S COMPUTIROUS SCIENTIST O FROM STAMFORD THAT I THOUGHT IS ONE OF THOSE BEAUTIFUL MINES EVER AND NOBODY REALLY TALK TO HIM LIKE  REALLY TALK TO HIM HES DID A FEW LECTURES WHICH HEOPLE LOVE BUT REALLY JUST HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH HIM IH TIS A FEW PEOPLE LIKE THAT ONE OF THEM PASS AWAY JOHN CONWAY THAT I NEVER GOT WL AGREE TO TALK BUT HE  DIED BEFORE I DID THIS A FEW PEOPLE LIKE THAT THAT I THOUGHT LIKE IT'S SUCH A CRIME TO NOT HERE THOSE FOLKS AND A I HAVE THE UNIQUE ABILITY TO A KNOW HOW TO PURCHAST AND A MICROPHONA AND AMAZON AND PLUGG IT INTO A DEVICE THEIR CORDS AUDIO AND THEN PUBLISH IT WHICH SEEMS RELATIVE UNIQUE LIKE IT'S THAT'S NOT EASY IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY PEOPLE KNOWING HOW TO PLUG IN A MICROPHON NO THEY CAN BUILD FERADAY CAGES AND TWOFOTS ON MICROSCOPES AND A BUT THE BIO ENGINEER ALL SORTS OF THINGS BUT A THE IDEA THAT YOU COULD TAKE IDEAS AND EXPORT THEM INTO A STRUCTURE OR SUIT OF STRUCTURE THAT PEOPLE WOULD BENEFIT FROM SEEMS LIKE UM A COSMIC ACHIEVEMENT TO THEM I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A FEAR OR JUST A BASICALLY T Y HAVEN'T TRYD AS TAT THEY'VE HAVEN'T LEARNE THE SKILL LEVEL BUT I THINK THEY'RE NOT TRAINED AT A WE  RIFF ON THIS FOR A WHILE BUT I THINK THAT UM BUT IT'S IMPORTANT AND I ME R SHOULD WHICH IS THAT IT'S THEY'RE NOT TRAIND TO DO IT THEYE TRAINE TO THINK IN SPECIFIC AIMS AND SPECIFIC HYPOTHESIES AND UM AND MANY OF THEM DON'T CARE TO RIGHT THEY THEY DON'T THEY THEY BECAME SCIENTIST BECAUSE A THAT'S WHERE THEY FELT SAFE AND SO WHY WOULD THEY LEAVE THAT UM HAVEN OF SAFETY OR THAT THEY ALSO DON'T NECESSARILY ALWAYS SEE THE VALUE IN IT IT'S IT'S WE'RE LL TOGE THER LEARNING YOU AND I ARE LEARNING THE VALUE OF THIS I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY YOU HAVE AN EXCEPTIONALLY A SUCCESSFUL AND AMAZING PACAS THE YOU STARTED JUST RECENTLY THANKS TO YOUR ENCOURAGEMENT WELL BUT THERE'S THERE'S A RAW SKILL THERE THAT IT THAT'S YOUYOUR DEFLING AN INSPIRATION NOT TO ME IN HOW YOU DO THE PAWCAS IN THE IN THE LEVEL OF EXCELLENCYO REACH BUT I THINK YOU'VE DISCOVERED THAT THAT'S ALSO AN AMPACTFUL WAY TO DO SCIENCE THAT PACAS AND I THINK A LOT OF A SCIENTISTS HAVE NOT YET DISCOVERED THAT THAT THIS IS A IF THEY APPLY A THE SAME KIND OF RIGOR AS THEY DO TO ECADEMIC PUBLICATION H OR TO EVEN CONFERENCE PRESENTATIONS AND THEY DO THAT  RIGOR AND A EFFORT TO A TOPACAST WHATEVER THAT IS THAT COULD BE A FIVE MENA PCAS A TO OUR PACAS HIT CULD BE CONVERSATIONAL OR CAN BE MORE LIKE LECTURE LIKE IF THEY APPLYD THAT EFFORT YOU HAVE THE PRETENTIAL TO REACH OVER TIME TENS OF THOUSANDS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND THOT' THAT'S REALLY REALLY POWERFUL BUT YET FOR FOR ME GIVING A PLATFORM TO A FEW OF THOSE FOLKS A ESPECIALLY FOR ME PERSONALLY SO MAYBE YOU CAN SPEAK TO WHAT FIELDS YOU'RE DRAWN TO BUT I THOUGHT COMPUTER SCIENTISTS A WERE ESPECIALLY BAD AT THIS AS SO THERE'S BRILLIANT COMPUTER SCIENTISTS THAT I THOUGHT A ITULD BE AMAZING TO EXPLORE THEIR MIND EXPLORED THEIR THINKING AND SO THAT I TOOK THAT ALMOST AS A ON AS AN EFFORT AND AT THE SAME TIME I HAD OTHER A GUESTS IN MIND OR PEOPLE THAT CONNECTTO MY OWN INTEREST SO THAT THE WRESTLING A WRESTLING MUSIC A FOTBALL BOTH AMERICAN FOBALL AND ANSAKER I HAVE A FEW PARTICULAR PEOPLE THAT I'M REALLY INTERESTED AND A ABOVISASATI OFS THE SIT YAR BROTHERS I EVEN COULD BE FOR WRESTLING JUST TALK TO THEM AS OK AS YOU CAN YOU YES CAN  COMMUNICATE IN RUSSIAN AND IN WRESTLING I AS WRESTLERS AND AS RUSSIANS AND A TO THAT THAT LITTLE ISAT AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE A MIND THAT A THAT I I'M ABLE TO BRING TO THE WORLD AND IT AND ALSO IT A I FEEL LIK COULD MEK ME A BETTER PERSON JUST THAT BEING THAT VULNERABLE AND EXPLORING IDEAS TOGETHER I DON'T KNOW LIKE GOOD CONVERSATION I N'T KNOW HOW OFTEN YOU HAVE REALLY O CONVERSATION WITH FRIENDS BUT LIKE PACASTS ARE LIKE THAT AND A IT'S IS DEEPLY MOVING TA BEST YOU KNOW AN AND WHAT WHAT YOU'VE BROUGHT THROUGH ET ME WHEN I SAW YOU SIT DOWN WITH PENROSE YOU KNOWT KNOW ABOT PRIZE WONDNT PHYSIIS IN THESE OTHER FOLKS I I'S NOT JUST AS HE HAS A NOBELLS BUT COMES OUT OF HIS MOUTH IS INCREDIBLE AN WHAT YOU WERE ABLE TO ON TO HOLD IN THAT CONVERSATION WAS SO MUCH BETTER LIGHT EARS BEYOND WHAT HE HAD ANY OTHER INTERVIEW ER AT AN WHAN YOU ECALL YOUR INTER YOURCAS TRALLY ABOUT CONVERSATION LIKE YEARS BEYOND WHAT ANY ONE ELSE HAD BEEN ABLE TO I ENGAGE WITH HIM WHAT'S UM WAS SUCH A BEACON OF WHAT'S POSSIBLE AND I I KNOW THAT I THINK THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE DRAWN TO AND AND THERE'S A CERTAIN INTIMACY THAT A CERTAINLY TO PEOPLE ARE FRIENDS AS WE ARE AND THEY KNOW EACH OTHER THAT THERE'S MORE OF THAT BUT THERE'S AN INTIMACY IN THOSE KINDS OF PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE MADE PUBLIC AND U WHAT THE THAT'S THE WITH YOU YOU'RE PROBABLY STYING TO REALIZE AND CASTALLO IS LIKE PART OF IT BECAUSE YOU'RE AUTHENTIC AND YOUR PUTTING YOURSELF OUT THERE COMPLETELY PEOPLE ARE ALMOST NOT JUST CONSUMING THE THE WORDS YOUR SAYING THEY ALSO ENJOY WATCHING YOU ANDREW STRUGGLE WITH THESE IDEAS OR TRY TO COMMUNICATE THESE IDEAS THEY LIKE THE FLAWS THEY LIKE HEY LIKE A HUMAN BEING IT AS THEHN I I DEALAWS BET IN'T GCAUSE I GOT PLENTY OF HE  THEY LIKE THE LIKE THE SELF CRITICAL ASPECTS ACT WHERE YOUARE VERY CARE WHERE WHERE YOUARE VERY SELF CRITICAL ABOUT YOUR FLAS I MEAN THAT IN IN THAT SAME WAY IT'S INTERESTING I THINK FOR PEOPLE TO WATCH ME TALK TO PENROSE NOT JUST BECAUSE PENROSE IT'S COMMUNICATING IDEAS BUT HERE'S THIS LIKE SILLY KID TRYING TO EXPLORE IDEAS THAT THEY KNOW THIS KID THAT THERE'S A HUMAN CONNECTION THAT IS REALLY POWERFUL SAY MI THINK WITH PUWTEN RI THAY IT'S NOT JUST ITS I A A GOOD INTERVIEW WITH PUTEN IT'S ALSO HEAR'S THIS KID STRUGGLING TO ARE TO TALK WITH ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL A SOME WHAT ARGUED DANGEROUS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THAT THEY LOVE THAT DE THETHE AUTHENTICITY THAT LED UP TO THAT THAK AN AND IN RETURN I GET TO CONNECT EVERYBODY I RUN TO IN THE STREET AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS A THERE'S A DEPTH OF CONNECTION THERE ALMOST WITHIN LIKE A MINUTE OR TWO THAT'S UNLIKE ANY OTHER AW THERE'S AN INTIMACY THAT YOU'VE FORMED WITH WYE YET WE'VE BEEN ON THIS LIKE JOURNEY TOGETHER AN YOU HAVE THE SAME THING WITH JO ROGEN BEFOR EVER MET AM I LIKE I WAS BECAUSE I WAS A FAN OF JOE FOR SO MANY YEARS YET THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THIS IT IS A KIND OF FRIENDSHIP AS ABSURD IT AS IT MIGHT BE TO SAY IN PODCASTHING AND LISTENING TO PODCAS YET MAYBE IT MAYBE IT FEELS IN A LITTLE BIT OF THAT ERE SOLVES A LITTLE BIT OF THAT LONELINESS YA TALKING ABOUT UNTI THE ROBATS A HERE I HAVE AM JUST A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS BUT ONE OF THEM IS ON BEHALF OF YOUR AUDIENCE WHICH IS UM I'M NOTKING TO ASK YOU THE MEANING OF THE HEDGEHOG BUT I JUST WANT TO KNOW DOES IT HAVE A NAME AND YOU' DOANT TO TELL US THE NAME BUT JUST DOES IT HAVE A NAME YES OR NO WELL HIE'S A THERE'S A NAME HE

SMOOTH QARTAC NOT YET NOT MANY 'S EXACTLY AND THIS LIKE HADGY LIKE SAW THROUGH ALL OF IT IT HE WAS LIKE A A A DUSTIUSKY'S MAN FROM UNDERGROUND AND THERE'S A SENSE THAT HE SAW THE DARKNESS OF THE WORLD

CERTAIN PERIOD AND THIS IS AGAIN A I DO'T KNOW WHAT ITS TO ATTRIBUTED TO BUT IS REALLY POWERFUL WHICH DOES A PERIOD IN SOBAT HISTORY I THINK PROBABLY SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES A WHERE LIKE ESPECIALLY

WOULDN'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW AN I WHAT A WHILL I NOW FEEL A CONNECTION TO HEDY THE HEDGEHOG THAT I CERTAINLY DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE AND I THINK THAT INCAPSILATES THE KIND OF POSSIBILITY OF CONNECTION OM THAT IS POSSIBLE BETWEEN HUMAN AND AND OTHER OBJECT IN THROUGH THE THRUGH ROBODIC CERTAINLY A THERE'S A SAYING THAT I HEARD WHEN I WAS A GRADULITSTUING THAT I THAT'S JUST BEEN RINGING IN MY MIND THROUGHOUT THIS CONVERSATION IN SUCH A I THINK APPROPRIATE WAY WHICH IS THAT I LIKES YOU ARE IN A MINORITY OF ONE YOU ARE TRULY A EXTRAORDINARY IN YOUR ABILITY TO INCAPS TILATE SO MANY ASPECTS OF SCIENCE ENGINEERING PUBLIC COMMUNICATION ABOUT SO MANY TOPICS MARTIAL ARTS AND THE EMOTIONAL DEPTH THAT YOU BRING TO IT AND JUST THE PURPOSEFULNESS AND I THINK IF IT'S NOT CLEAR TO PEOPLE IT ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE STATED BUT I'M THINK IT'S ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT JUST THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND THINKING THAT YOU PUT INTO THINGS IS A IT IT IS THE ULTIMATE MARK OF RESPECT IM SO I'M JUST EXTRAORDINARILY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR FRIENDSHIP AND FOR THIS CONVERSATIANMA PROUD TO BE AUR FRIEND AND I JUST WISH YOU SHOWED ME THE SAME KIND OF RESPECT BY WEARING A SUIT AND MAKE YOU A FATHER PROUD

HOW SPEAKER CEVEN MC CARTHY ANNOUNCE IS AN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY INTO JOBIDON SOMEHOUSE RE PUBLICANS AT THREATEN MC CARTHY'S SPEAKERSHIP AND WE REVIEW THE VIDIO MUSIC AWARDS I BENTHPURE OF THIS IS BENCHVARRO SHO TO DAY SHOWS PONSER BAXPRESSBE PIAN THOUSANDS F MY LISTERS OV ALREADY SECURED THEIR NETR TDEY TOD JOIN THEM EXPRESSY PIANTA CAM FLESHMEN WELL IT'S NOW OFFICIAL YESTERDAY THE HOUSE SPEAKER CEN MAC CARTHE ANNOUNCE THAT THERE WOULD IN FACT BEANG IMPEACHMEN INQUIRY INTO JOBIDN SURROUNDING ALL HIS ACTIVITIES WITH HIS SON HUNTER AS WELL AS PRESUMABLY THE COVER UP THAT'S BEEN ATTEMPTED BY THE DO JA OF ANY INVESTIGATION INTO A HUNTER'S ACTIVITIES INCLUDING JO AND HERE'S A THING WE ALREADY KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC IN FACT THERE'S A TON OF EVIDENCE THAT'S ALREADY OUT IN PUBLIC VIEW THANKS TO THE SO CALLED LAP TOP FROM HELL YOU KNO THE ONE THAT WAS SUPPOSED O BE RUSSIAN DIS IN FORMATION THAT WAS DISMISSED BY THE ENTIRE MEDIA IN THE MONTH LEADING UP TO THE LAST ELECTION CYCLE AND HERE MANY OF THE THINGS WE KNOW WE KNOW THAT HUNTER BIDON HAS SPEN THE LAST DECADE JET SETTING AROUND TO RANDUM COUNTRIES AS A DURILIC DRUG ATIC PROSTITUTE ABUSER AND HE'S BEEN PICKIN UP BACKS OF CASH ON FOREIGN BOARDS WELL CALLING HIS DABDIN ON THE PHONE TO PROVE HIS CONNECTION TO HIS DADDY WE KNOW THAT TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE FLOODED INTO  HUNTER BIDON CONNECTED BUSINESS IS OR DIRECTLY TO HUNTER BIDON WE KNOW THAT HUNTER BIDON TEXTED HIS OWN DAUGHTER SUGGESTING THAT HE PAID HIS DADS BILLS WE KNOW ALL OF THESE THINGS NONE OF THAT IS IN DISPUTES WHEN PEOPLE SAY THERE'S NO EVIDENCE LIKE EVERYTHING I JUST SAID THERE'S HONS OF EVIDENCE FOR ALL OF THAT LITERALLY THE ONLY THING MISSING WOULD BE THE CON QUOE SMOKING GONE NAMELY SOME SORT OF TRANSACTION BETWEEN ONE OF HUNTER BIDON'S BUSINESS IS ANJO BIDON'S DIRECT BANK ACCOUNT BUT IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT TO PROVE BRIBERY OR CORRUPTION AND BY THE WAY JOBIDON IS NOT BEING CRIMINALLY CHARGED BRIBERY OR CRUPTION HERE IS THE THING THE DEMOCRATS BROKE THE MOLE AND WHEN THEY DECIDE THEY 'RE GOING TO IMPEACH DONAL TRUMP WITHOUT ACTUALLY ALLEGING A CRIME NOT ONCE BUT TWICE WHEN THEY SAID WE ARE NOT GOING TO ATTEMPT TO PUSH EVEN A PROSCUTORIAL MOTION OF WHAT CRIME WAS COMMITTED KNO STATUTE WAS ACTUALLY SITED IN EITHER OF THE IMPEACHMENT PAPERS THET WERE FILED INSTEAD THER'RE GENERAL ACCUSATIONS OF CORRUPTION GENERAL ACCUSATIONS OF PRESSURE AND THEY CAN DO THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN PEACHMENT IS TO POLITICAL PROCESS BUT ONCE YOU SAY THA YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO A LEDGE O CRIME IN ORDER TO PUSHI IM PEACHMENT AND THEN YOU DO IT TWICE WHY WOULD YOU THINK IT'S NOCKING TO COME AROUND AND CLOCKU AGAIN YEU BROKE THE GLASS THE GLASS IS STILL BROKEN AND HERE'S THE REALITY F RE PUBLICANS DID NOT DO THE SAME THING IN REVERSE WELL THEN DEMOCRATS WHO JUST CONTINUE TO DO THIS WILLIN NILLY THEAUSE THEY'RE TWO POSSIBILITIES HERE IN TERMS OF GOING BACK TO STATUS PO ANTY OR PEOPLE DINGRANIMALLY JUST IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT OF THE OPPOSING PARTY THERE THEY'E TO POSSBILLIS ONE EVERYBODY GOES WEAPONS DOWN UNLESS THERE'S AN ACTUAL FULL SKALE CRIME COMMITTED THAT COULD THEORETICALLY BE PROSECUTED BUT COULDN'T BE BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS IMMUNE TO FEDERAL PROSECUTION WHILE HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES RIHT THAT THOU'D BE THE THE BETTERSTATUS GLANTYE'S TAT WE DON'T PROSECUTE EVERY PRESIDENT OR EX PRESIDENT UNLESS THEY ACTUALLY COMMIT A FEDERAL CRIME T AND IN HS TO BE COMPLETELY EVEN HANDED AND HOW WE ACTUALLY PURSUE JUSTICE THAT BE THE BETTER VERSION AND THEN THERE IS THE SECOND VERSION WHICH IS WE JUST WILLY NILLY IMPEACH PETTY MUCH EVERYBODY AND FROM HERE UNTIL THE END OF TIME WE IMPEACH EVERYBODY AN NAT I SUPPOSE WE CAN LIVE WITH THAT TO I SUPPOSE WE CAN DO THAT IN ONLEATS THE BEST THING FOR THE COUNTRY PERSAY BUT SURE I SUPPOSE WE C AND THAT IS WHERE WE NOW ARE SO YESTERDAY CEVN MC CARTHY ANNOUNCE THAT HOUSE COMITES WOULD OPEN A FORMAL IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY INTO PRESSION O BIDEN RAPPING UP TEOP PE AFFORTS TO ON EARTH ANY EVIDENCE OF WRONG DOING AHEAD OF THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ELECTION HERE WAS SPEAKER MC CARTHY ANNOUNCING THIS YESTERDAY THESE ARE ALEGATIONS OF ABUSEI POWER OBSTRUCTION INCRRUCTION THEY WARE FURTHER INVESTIGATION BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES THATS LOTO DAY I AM DIRECTING OUR HOUSE COMMITTEE TO OPEN A FORMAL AMD PEACHMAN INQUIRY INTO PRESIDENT JOBIN THES LOGICAL NEC STEP WILL GIVE OUR COMMITTEE IS THE FULL POWER TO GATHER ALL THE FACTS AN ANSERS FOR THE MERICAN PUBLIC  SO WHAT SORT OF POWERS ATTACHED TO AN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY FOR STE NON IM PEACHENTINCGRY THE ANSWER IS NOT ALL THAT MUCH ALL THESE COMITTES ALREADY HAD SEPINA POWER SO  NOW PRESUMABLY THEY WIL JUST HAVE A BETTER EXCUSE TO USE THAT SEPINA POWER SO THEORETICALLY IF YOU ARE SOPINAD AND YOUR MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCE YOU CAN SAY I'M NOT GON SHOW BY NOT CON TESTIFI BECAUSE THIS IS NOT WITHIN THE NORMAL PURVIEW OF A CONGRESSIONAL IN VESTIGATION TYPICALLY CONGRESSIONAL IN VESTIGATIONS HAVE ONE OF TWO PURPOSES ONE IS OVERSIHT OF AN OF A FUNCTION THAT THE EXECUTIVE IS SUPPOSED TO BE PERFORMING SO I PASS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION AT PIECE OF LEGISLATION SAYS THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS SUPPOSED TO DISPERSE MONEYS IN A PARTICULAR WAY AND NOW I'M SEPINA ING THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TOLD MAKE SURE THAT YOU DID THE THING THAT WE LEGISLATED THAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT IS POSSIBILITY NUMBER ONE POSSIBILY NUMBER TOO WHEN A COMES TO CONGRESS AND AND LEGITIMATE PURPOSE OF A SOPINA WOULD BE LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE IS WE'RE DOING AN IN VESTIGATION INTO THIS PROBLEMS WE CAN THEN CRAFT LEGISLATION IN ORDER TO PURSUE IN END TO THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY PROVIDE TO DEFENSE TO HE POSSIBILITY OEARE DOING NEITHER OF THESE TWO SO REGGYUR YOU'RE NOT ACTILY CRAFTING PIECE O LEGISLATION ON THE ONE HAND AND YOURE ALSO NOT DOING AN OVERSIGHTE FUNCTION OF A OF AN EXECUTIVE JOB THATS DELEGATED BY THE LEGISLATURE YOU DOING SOMETHING ELSE ANOTHER CONSTITUTIONALLY PERFORMED DUTY WHICH IS IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AND SO IF SOMEBODY SAYS ON ONE TRUMP FOR THISOPPENOT THEORETICALLYOU GO TO COURTING YOU SAY WELL YOU HAVE TO AND ANDYOU HAVE TO MORE THAN U NORMALLY WOULD BECAUSE EVEN THOUH IT'S NOT LEGISLATION AN IS NOT QUITE OVERSIHT IT ISN'T IMPEACHENT INQUIRY IN THAT IS A NATURAL FUNCTION OF OF THE HOUSE NOW WHAT IS THIS REALLY WHAT IT REALLY IS JUS THE REPUBLICAN SAYING THAT WE ARE KICKING THIS IMPEACHMENT STUFF IN TO HIGH GEAR NOW THAT THERE ARE FEW PROBLEMS WITH THIS PARTICULAR STRATEGY FROM MC CARTHY PROBLEM NUMBER ONE IS THAT MC CARTHY IS DOING THIS WITHOUT A VOTE SO NANSUPPOLOSE YOU DID DO THIS AND NANSIPLOCY DID NOT TAKE A VOTE OF THE HOUSE BEFORE SHE ACTUALLY PURSUED IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT TRUM AND THAT ALOW THE TRUMP DE OJAY TO CLAIM THAT THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO PROCEED PROPERLY SO NOW YOU ASSUME THAT THE BY DMNISTRATIONS CAN O DO THE SAME THING THEY DN SAY YOU NEW TAKE A VOTE IN THE HOUSE TO OPEN IN INPEACHMEN INQIRIESO WHY SHOULD WE RESPECT THE NOTION THE SEASON IS LEGALLYAN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY WERE NOT CON T EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE IS AN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY YE YOU CAN'T JUSTARTAN M PEACHMEN INQUIRY WAS TRUMS CASE ACTUALLY WHEN IT WAS DEMOCRATS IN CHARGE OF CONGRESS TRUM'S CASE WAS THIS IS NOT LIKE MICHAEL SCOTT SHOUTING BANKRUPTSYF JUST WALK INTO A BUILDING SHOUT I'VE OPEN AN IMPEACHMEN INQUIRY THIS DOESN'T ATTACH ANY NEW POWERS TO YOU WAS THE CASE THAT TRUMPSTEOJAY MADE THAT CAN NOW BE USED THAT AXAC CASE CAN BE USED BY THE BIDING DEOJA AGAINST KEV MC CARTHY AND AND THE HOUSE RE PUBLICANS THAT IS THE POINT POLITICO IS MAKING TO DAY IN CANUARY TWENTY TWENTY THE DONALD TRUMPLOOD JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FORMALLY DECLARED THAT IM PEACHMENT INQUIRIES BY THE HOUSE ARE IN VALID UNLESS THE CAMBER TAKES FORMAL VOTES TO AUTHORIZE THEM THAT OPINION WAS ISSUED BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS OH ELL SEE THE OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNCIL AND IT CAME IN RESPONSE TO SPEAGER NANCY PLOZY DOING JUST THAT SEEVEN ANGELL WAS THEN THE HEAD OF THE DEO JAYS OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNCIL ON SAID WE CONCLUDE THE HOUSE MUST EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZE COMMITTEE TO CONDUCT IN IMPEACHMENT INVESTIGATION AND USE COMPULSORY PROCESS IN THAT INVESTIGATION BEFORE THE COMMITTEE THEY COMPELL THE PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENS OR TESTIMONY TO PRESUMABLY THE BY DMINISTRATIONS GOIN TO DO THE SAME THING NOW MC CARTHY WAS ASKED WHY HE FLIPPED ON THES BECAUSE MC CARTHY HAD SUGGJUSTED NOT ALL THAT LONG AGO THAT LIKE LIKE ELEVEN DAYS AGO THAN IF YOUS CAN TO MOVE ON AN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY THAN WHO'S COIN TO DO SO WITH THE HOUSE VOTE THEN HE DIDN'T DO SO WIT THE HOUSE VOTE JUST DECLARED I'VE OPEN AN MPEACHMENT INQUIRY AND DOM AND YU'S ASKED ABOUT THIS AN HES O WOLL YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE GOOSICGOR FOR THE GANDR NANCY PLOCY DID THAT AND NOW WE CAN WE CAN DO THE SAME THING WHICH AGAIN IS TRUE BUT IT DOES UNDER SCORE A BIT OF WEAKNESS IN THIS IMPEACHMENT INQUIR WHIS WILL GET TO IN JUST ONE SECOND FIRST LET'S TALK ABOUT TH WEAKNESS OF THE AMERICAN ACCIM MAR NOW GOT NEW ECONOMIC NUMBERS COMING IN WILL TALK ABOUT IN A LITTLE WHILE I GOT TELL YOU THEY ARE NOT GOOD IT IT PEOPLE ARE HAVING A HARD TIME FINGURING OUT WER TO PUT THEIR MONEY I AM AND THIN PREY MUCH EVERYBODY AS YOU PUT IT IN REALS THAT'LL SIKE THE REALS THEY MARKET IS CRUISIN FOR A BRUISEN YOU PUT IT IN THE STOCK MARKET LOOKS LIKE THE STOCK MARKET IS OVERVALUED WHEN YOU LOOKATLY PRICE TO EARNINGS RATIOS SO WHERE T YOU PUT THE MONEY ONE THNG COULD DO IT'S TAKE AT LEAST SOME OF YOUR MONEY AND PUT IN PRECIOUS METALS AS A HEDGE HAY THAT THAT'S JUST A SMART THING THE PEOPLE DO THEY DIVERSIFY THEIR ASS AT BASE THIN VESTOERS AND SAVORS ARE LOOKING TO HARNESS THE POWER OF PHYSICAL GOLD HELD AN ATTAX SHELTERED IRA I BYGOLD FROM BIRCH GOLD I TRUST THEM TO HELP ME DIVERSIFY MY SAVINGS YOU CAN PROTECT OR IARRAY OR FOR ONE CAD BI DIVERSIFYING WITH GOLD FROM BIRCH GOLD AS THE OSTOLLER CONTINUES TO RECEIVE PRESSURE FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES TI GURAL CURRENCIAN CENTRAL BANKS IT'S GOOD TO ARM YOURSELF WIT THE IN FORMATION THAT YOU NEED TO PROTECT YOUR SAVING TEXBEN TO NINETY EIGHT NINETY EIGH NINETY EIGHT THEY'LL SEND YOU A FREE IN FORMATION CET ONGOLD WITH AN A PLUSRATING WIT THE BETTER BUSINESS YOUREO THOUSANDS OF HAVE CUSTOMERS COUNTLESS FIVE STOUR VIEWS I TRUSTBERCH GOL TO HELP YOU DIVERSE FIND GULL ASK ALL YOUR QUESTIONS AND THEN WHEN HE FEEL SECURE THEN START DIVERSIFYING WE ME NIST HAVE SOME GOLD TO DEPEND ON IN TOUG TIMES AGAIN TEXT BEN TO NINETY EIGT NINETY EIGHT NINETY EIGHT TO GET START O CA SO THE THE FAILURE TO WANCH THE IM PEACHMENT INQUIRY WITH AVOTE THERE THERE'S SOMETHING HAPPENING THAT ONE THINGS THAT'S HAPPENING THERE IS THAT MC CARTHY MAY NOT ACTUALLY HAVE IN MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE TO OPEN THE IMPEACHMEN INQUIRY IN OTHER WORDS HE DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE ALL OF HIS RE PUBLICANS ON BOARD REMEMBER HE ASN' IN RIDABLY SLIM MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES RIGHT NOW AND ALL IT WOULD REQUIRE IS JUST A FEW OF THESE PEOPLE TO DROP OFF AND AND YOU DON'T HAVE A MAJORITY AT ALL IN SUPPORT OF SOMETHING LIKT IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAIN WRIGHT NOW THE CONSTITUENCY IS TWO HUNDER TWENTY TO REPUBLICANS IN TO UNDRED TWELVE DEMOCRAPS AND YOU REQUIRE TWO HUNDRED AND  SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN FOR THE MAJORITY SO ALL HE HAS TO DO IS LOSE LIKE FIVE REPUBLICANS AND HE DOESN'T HAVE A MAJORITY IN SUPPORT OF AN IMPEACHET NQUIRY SO INSTEAD HE'S DOING IT WITHOUT THE VOTE HRE THE PROBLEM IS AN IF YOU DON'T HAVE SUPPORT TO OPEN I IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY HIRIGAN ACHLY VOTE FOR M PEACHMENT SO IS HE WRITING A CHECK THAT HE THEN CAN'T CASH BECAUSE AN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY THAT ENDS WITH NOT IMPEACHMEN LOOKS LIKE AN EXONERATION IF THE OPPOSING PARTY OPENS AN IMPEACHMENT NQUIRY AND THEN SAYS WHELL YOU NOW WHAT FORAGET IT IT TURNS OUT WHICH I'T HAVE THE GOODS THOLK'S TERRIBLE FOR RE PUBLICANS SO MC CARTHY IS OPENING IN VESTIGATION AND IT'S UNCLEAR IN WHICH DIRECSION THIS IS GOING TO GO WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION AS TO WY EXACTLY HE IS DOING THAT SO ONE PIECE OF SPECULATION THERE THERE'S FOR THE PRINCIPALE REASON THERE'S THE NON PRINCIPAL REASON BOTH ARE POSSIBILITIES THE PRINCIPALES REASON TO OPEN IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRIES BECAUSE THERE'S ACTUALLY AS I SAY HUNS OF EVIDENCE THAT JO BIDON AN HUNDER BIDN ERE INVOLVED IN CORRUP BARGAINING TOGETHER THAT THAT EVIDENCE IS WIDESPREAD IT EXISTS IT IS OUT THERE YESHE DON'T EVEN NEED ALL THAT MANY ADDITIONAL FACTS AND I WONDER WHAT THEY THINK THEY ARE GOING TO DISCOVER HERE THAS CAN A CHANGE THE MAT THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK THAT AN IMPEACHMEN INQUIRY MIGHT DISCOVER THAT WE DON'T ALREAD YOU KNOW IS JUS THE LEVEL TO WHICH THE DO JA WAS PRESSURING PEOPLE LIKE DAVID WISES TOCK AE SWEETHART TO GO ITH HUNTER BIDON TO KILL ANY INVESTIGATION IN TO HUNDER BDONS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS DAD FINANCIALLY AT THAT'S THE PART THAT'S THE OTHER SHOUE TO DROP THAT PRESUMABLY IS WHY KEVE MC CARTHY IS TALKING ABOUT NOTJUST CORRUPTION OR ABUSIVE POWER BUT ALLSO OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE AT THE IDEA THAT THE DOJ WAS WEAPONIZED ON BEHALF OF THE BIDAN FAMILY IN ORDER PROTECT JOE FROM HIS CORRUPT RELATIONSHIP OF HUNTER AND THAT WEU MIGHT FIND OUT THE IMPEACHMENT SO THE PRINCIPALED REASON TO OPEN TH IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IS CAUSE YOU THINK YOU'R ACTULLY GOING TO GET MORE IN FORMATION VIA THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY THAN YOU WOULD OTHERWISE AND THEN THERE'S THE  SORT OF UN PRINCIPAL REASON AND THAT IS MC CARTHY IS UNDER SEVEUR FIRE RIGHT NOW FROM THE MADGATES WING OF THE PARTY AND AGAIN THAT WING IS REALLY SMALL JUST BY BY ACTUAL MUMBERS IT IS A VAST MANORITY OF THE RE PUBLICAN PARITY MATGATES IS PUTTING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OR PRESSURE ON  KEP MC CARTHY WITH REGARD TO SPENDING AND HES THREATENING HIS SPEAKERSHIP RIGHT NOW AND ONE WAY IF YOURE COVEN MC CARTHY TO AVOID THAT'S FORT PRESSURE IS TO GO BACK TO THE BASIN AY LISTON I DON'T YOU WANT FOR ME I'M GIVING O WHATYOU WANT AND GIVEN MOU THEIMPEACMENT INQUIRY I'M GOING AFTER JOBIDON I'M I'M ONE I'S PRIDE CONCESSIONS OUT OF JOBIDON WHO'S YOUR ALTERNATIVE SO MAYBE IN RESPONSE TO THE PRESSURE HE OPENS THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AND THUS AVOID TO SPEAKERSHIP FIGHT THAT'S THE THAT'S THE MORE CYNICAL REASON TAT YOUWOULD OPEN IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY WITHOUT OF A TURES MATGATES YESTERDAY TRYING TO PRESSHMC CARTHY I RISE TO DAY TO SERVE NOTICE MISTER SPEAKER YOU ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE AGREEMENT THAT ALLOWED YOU TO ASSUME THIS ROLL THE PATH FORWARD FOR THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IS TO EITHER BRING YOU INTO IMMEDIATE TO TAL COMPLIANCE OR REMOVE YOU PURSUANT TO EMOTION TO VACATE THE CHAIR MISTER SPEAKER YOU BOASTED IN JANUARY THAT WE WOULD USE THE POWER OF THE CEPINA AND THE POWER OF THE PURSE BUT HERE WE ARE EIGHT MONTHS LATER AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN SENT THE FIRST OPINA TO HUNTER BINE THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW THAT THE ROSH AND YOU'RE SOMEWHAT RATTLE PERFORMANCE YOU JUST SAW FROM THE SPEAKER IS IT REAL AT THIS POINT DURING DEMOCRAT CONTROL OVER THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES THEYT ARE HE BROUGHT IN DON JUNIOR THREE TIMES AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN SET THE FIRST CEPENA TO HUNTER BOD NAY ZO AGAIN THE SYNICAL REASON HERE IS THE MC CARTHY HIS BASICALLY SAYING THAT OKA AND SO NOW I'M DOING IT AM BRINGING IN EVERYBODY WERE CAN DO THE COPINA POWER CANTO ALL THOSE SORTS OF THINGS HERE'S THE REALITY WHEN THE SORT OF QUIXSOTIC QUESS TO GET RID OF SPEAKER MAC CARTHY I SAID THITS AT THE TIME I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT CONCESSION AR TRYING TO PRY FROM HIM IF YOU CAN NAME ME THE CONCESSIONS THAT YOU THINK ARE GOING TO MAKE GOVERNENCE IN THE HOUSE BETTER AND MORE CONSERVE VE THEM ALL FOR IT CHIP ROYDED AND WE HAD CHIPRYOUN THE PROGRAM AT THE TIME WHEN THEY WERE HAVING THE SPEAKER FIGHTED NES SAID LIKE WHAT YOU WANT FROM MAC CARTHINE YOU LISTET A BUNCH OF THINGS I SAIDN'T MAC CARTHY GIVES YOU THOSE THINGS WIL YE SUPPORT HIM NUWS I GUESS IF THT IS A POSITION THE MAKE SENSEYOU MUST NOT A POSITION THE MAKE SENSE I DON'T LIKE SPEAK O MC CARTHYAN HE SHOULD GO AND I HAVE AN ALTERNATIVES SO I'M JUST GOING TO YELL ABOUT THINGS GOT THAT'S NOT A STRATEGY AND IT'S NOT A PLAN SO WHAT EXACTLY IS IT THAT YOU ARE SEEKING TO ACHIEVE AT THIS POINT AT'S MC CARTHY IS NOW OPENED THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY SENERC HAVIN CRAMER OF NORTH TO CODA CALL THE IN QUIRING TO PROPRIATE STEP FOR THE REPUBLICANS SEND IT MINORITY LIDR MIH MACCONNAL SAID M CARTHY DIDN'T NEED HIS ADVICE ON HOW TO RUN THE HOUSE WHICH IS A GOD WAY FROM MAC CONNALL TO AVOID THAT FIGHT ITES A MTTER A MAC CONALL HAS TO SAY ANYWAY SINCE HE'S NOT THE MAJORITY LEADER SO HE HAS NO POWER TO ACTUALLY PRESIDE OVER ANY SORT OF SENATE PROCESS FOR FULL SCALE REMOVAL FROM OFFICE EVEN IF BID WERE TO BE IMPEACHED OVER THE SORTS OF CHARGES REPRESENT OM KENBUCK OF COLORADO HEAD ARGUED AN INQUIRY BE UN NECESSARY BECAUSE OF EXISTING COMMITTEEINVESTIGATIONS HE SAID THE MC CARTHY MADE A GOOD DECISION TO NOT HOLD THE VOTE HE SAID IT WOULD AVE DISTRACTED FROM THE WORK WERE TRYING TO GET DONE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN THE A TEMPT TO FUND THE GOVERNMENT TO AGAIN THE POWERS THAT HAVE BEEN EXTENDED TO THE HOUSE ARE RELATIVELY MINER HERE ALL IT REALLY DOES IS IN VERY PUBLIC TERMS IT SAYS WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE CORRUPT AND WE ARE GOING TO COME AFTER YOU WITH WHATEVER POWERS WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL AND THAT IS NOT A BAD THING I THING THAT IS VERY WORTH WHILE THING FOR AS I SAID TWO PURPOSES ONE IS MUTUALLY SURE DESTRUCTION IF YOU GET T KEEP IMPEACHING REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS LIKE OVER AND OVER AND OVER JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE THEM WHEL THEN WE'RE GOING TO DO THE SAME THING TO YOUR GUISE AND WE'LL SE OW YOU LIKE IT SO MUTUALLY SURE DESTRUCTION IS ONE WAY OF GETTNG AP RIDYBACK DOWN AND THE SECOND IS AT DON'T BIDN ACTUALLY IS DEEPLY CORRUPT AND HAS BEEN EEPLY CORRUPT FOR DECADES ON END WHEN JUST ONE SIDE WILL GETS THE DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE TO THE TO THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY FIRST LET'S TALK ABUT BON CHARGE ISTAT HOLISTIC WELLNESS BRAND WITH A HUGE RANGE OF

REPUBLICAN HOUSE OVERSIDE COMMITTEE IS GOING TO PRESIDE OVER ALL OF THIS APPARENTLY MC CARTHY SAYS THAT HES CAN TO HAVE JAMES COMER OF CENTUCKY TAKE THE LEAD ON THE IMPEACHMENT IN WHERE HE'S IN A WORK ALONGSIDE UMJORDAN OF OHIO AND JASON SMITH OF MISSOURY AGAIN IT ITS IT DIDN'T REQUIRE MAJORITY VOTE TO DO THIS THE FACT THAT E DIDN'T HAVE A MAJORITY VOTE MAKES THIS IS SOMEWHAT RISKY MOVE BECAUSE THE QUESTION IS GOIN TO BE WHERE THE GET ENOUGH REPUBLICANS TO VOTE IN THE ENDS TOIM PEACH JOBIDN ON WHATEVER THEY UNCOVER NONE THE LESS DEMOCRATS OUR FIGHTING MAD ABOUT IT AS YOU'D IMAGINE CHUCKSUMER THE SENTATE MAJORITY LEADER I HE'S NOW USING LANGUAGE THAT WE REMEMBER FROM OM FROM THE TRUMP DAYS MEMBER WHEN WHEN TRUMP WOULD SAY THAT IT'S THAT'S A WHITCH HUNT WHICH HUNTS REMEMBER THAT IN RETTY MUCH EVERYQWEAT AND I'M IT KIND OF WAS WHELL NOW CHUCKSUMERIS ADOPTING THAT LANGUAGE I THINK THE IMPEACHMAN INQUIRY IS EBSURD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT US TO DO SOMETHING THAT WILL MAKE THEIR LIVES BETTER

FORWARD ON THIS IF THIS HOUSE INQUIRY TURNS INTO A FORBLON IN PEATCHMAN AND I HAVE TO SAY IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE A DOZEN TANAN AN I CAN A DOING I PEACHMEN INQUIRY IN THEN CLEAR PRESEN BIDN RIT I MEAN IS THE BOTTOM LINE LOOKING FORWARD THAT THIS NO WAY IN PEACHMENT SUPPORTERS ARE GOING TO GET TWO THIRDS OF THE SENA SO BID WILL BE QUIT THIS IS JUST HE DIVERSION ON THE PART OF  CART  HE CANNOT COVE HE CANNOT CAV HS MAJORITY IN HEHOUSERERS THAT  AS TO DO THE BASICS TO KEEP GOVERNMENTS LIGT TO AND SO IS TO SUDE FOR A DIVERSION LETS TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE THO THE MIGHT EGREE AN I PEACHEN WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AN MONEY SO I LOVE THE DIC TURBANS LIKE GAT HE MIGHT BE SUPERCORRUPT ANDA IT'S IT'S REALLY UGLY BUT TO WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY FIRST OF ALT WHEN HAVE DEMOCRATS IN LEGISLATURS EVER CARED

OF DOLLARS FROM OVERSEES INTEREST THOSE THINGS ARE NORMAL THAT'S NOT NORMAL HAVE TWENTY SELF SHEL COUNTRY COMPANYES THESE THINGS ARE NOT NORMAL AND IT ALLUDES TO NOT ONLY JUST BIDESPREAD CORRUPTION BUT MONEY LANDERING IF NOT INFLUENCE PEDDLING ITSELF AND WE ALSO HAVE THE PRESIDENT OUGHT OF THE VICE PRESIDENT AT THE TIME ON RECORD SING THAT THE PROSECUTOR WAS FOR WELL SON OF A THA PROSECUTOR WAS FIRED RIGHT BECAUSE THE PROSECUTOR WITH GOING AFTER THE THE COMPANY THAT HIS SON WAS WORKING OUHT THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE IF YOU CAN'T SEE THAT IF YOU ARE OF YOU'RE A THAT BLONT HE HAPPENS TO BE CRIING WHELE MARGERY TALL AGREEING CORECTLY POINTS OUT THAT IT'S NOT JUSS THAT IT'S ALSO THE POSSIBILITY THE JOBIDONS DOO JAY WAS SHUTTING DOWN INVESTIGATION WE'D DO ALREADY HAVE WISTABLOWERS WHO SAID AS MUCH I'M VERY EXCITED TO SEE A HAPPEN I THINK A MARI CANS TO SERVE TRATH THAT THIS OUR CHANCE PANCY AND LE NAN THE SINVESTIGATSION TEGALIS LONG AS THAT NAN SIN TO AN COVER ALL THE CORREPTION THAT ITS THEN ANVOLVED AN CAVERING AT CHABIDANS CRAMS ET SO AGAIN NOT WRONG ON ANY OF THIS NOW DEMOCRATS ARE ALREADY TRYING TO SPEND THIS INTO WHILL WHAT ABOUT JERD AND VONCA AND ALL ALL THE REST OF THAT SORT OF THING HIS FIRST WOLL JEURNOVONCA WERE ACTUAL EMPLOYES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HUNTER WAS NEVER IN EMPLOY YOU THE FEDERL GOVERNMENT WHILE JOBINE WAS VICE PRESIDENT HUNTER WAS JUST GOING AROUND AS A BAG MAN FOR HIS FAMILY FOR MILT TO MILT THE TON MILLIONS DOLLARS AND CALLING HIS DADDY IN TO MEETINGS IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE THAT HE HAD FLECTS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT IS NOT THE SAME THING AS YOU'RE A FEDERAL IMPLOYEE WHOSE WORKED ON THINGS LIKE THAT ABRAHAMICORDS WHICH BY THE WAY THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MIDLY'S PEASE INITIATIVE OF THE LAST TWO GENERATIONS WHICH IS WHAT JERRED AND AVONCA WE'RE DOING DURING THAT TIME TAND THEN AFTER YOU LEAVE OFFICE THEN YOU REND UP DOING A BUSINESS DEAL THAT IS PUBLICLY DISCLOSED IN ALL ITS DETAILS PUBLICLY DISCLOSE HOWDO WE KNOW ABOUT JERDS INVESTMENTS WITH THE SOUTIES IN VICEVERSSA BECAUSE IT'S ALL PUBLICLY DISCLOSED AS BOST A HUNTER BIDON WHO HID THIS CRAP FORE YEARS AND THERE SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES RIGHT HERE OBVIOUSLY BUT WHAT WE'RE GOIN TO CONFLATE ALL THE THINGS AT THE SAME TIME OF COURSE IN THE END HOW MUCH IS THE INPEACHMENT STUFF GOING TO DAMAGE JOBIN IT IT'S ONLY I A DAMAGE JOBIDONIF I JUST MEANS THERE IS ADDITIONAL ATTENTION BROUGHT TO HIS CORRUPTION SEE CORLD AV DONE THAT THEORETICALY WITHOUT IN PEACHMEN WILKIAN BE A BPEACH I DONTKNOW AND YOU CAN HAVE TO GET FOUR FIVE REPUBLICANS IN PURPLE DISTRICTS ON BOARD IN ORDER TO DO THAT BUT ONE THING IS BEING UNDER SCORTFOR DEMOCRATS AND THAT IS JOBIDON CONTINUES TO BE AN EXTRAORDINARILY WEAK CANDIDATE THE ECONOMY IS NOT DOING WELL UNDER JOBID IT IS JUST THAT SIMPLE ACCORDING TO AXIOS A MEASURE OF POVERTY TRACK BY THE CENTS HIS BUEAU RODES IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO AS COVET YEAR BENEFITS EXPIRED N AVERAGE IN COME FELL ACCORDING TO A TWOSAIR PORT CHOW POVERTY SA A SHARP INCREASE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOLLOWING A RECORD LOATHTHE YEAR PRIOR NOW THE REASON SAW RECORD LOW IS BECAUSE JOBIDON SPENT A BE JILIAN DOLLARS JUST POURING MONEY ON THE RAGING FLAME OF INFLATION AND TURNING IT INTO A HUGE GAS FIRER THAT IS ENGULF THE ENTIRE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND THEN THAT WASN'T RENEWED AND THE'S IT WILL YOURE INCREASING CHIL POVERTY BECAUSWERE NOT SIGNING GIANT CHECKS TO PEOPLE WELL YA I TURNS OUT THAT WHEN YOU SIGNE ENORMOUS AMOUNT O MONEY OVER TO PEOPLE THAT TEMPORARILY RELIEVES THEIR POVERTY BUT DOES NOT PERMANENTLY RELIEVE THEIR POVERTY THE ONLY WAY TO TRULY REDUCE CHIL POVERTY IN THE LONG TERM IN THE UNITED STATES IS OHAVE A GROWING A CONOMU WERE MOM AND DAD OUR MARRIEDAND HAVE JOBS THAT IS THAT IS THE WAY THE EARE SOD REDUCE CHIL POVERTY LONG TURM NOT BY SIMPLY SIGNING CHECKS JOBIN IN COURSEIS BLAMING HIS POLITICAL OPPOSITION BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THE DEMOCRATS USE COVID AS AN EXCUSE TO BLOW MONEY OUT THE WAW ZO FOR THREE STREE YEARS AND THAT WAS NOT MAINTAINABLE AS WE CAN SEE FROM THE INFLATION RATE AS WE CAN SEE FROM THE STAGNATING ECONOMY MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME AT FELL BY TWO POINT THREE PER CENT FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO ADJUSTING A FOURT INFLATION INCOMES DECREASED IN WHITE AND NOT HIS FANIC WHITE HOUSEHOLD THAT REMAIN SIMILAR IN BLACK ASIEN AND HIS FANNIC HOUSEHOLDS AND INFLATION ROSE SEVEN POINT EIGHT PER CENTS IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO ON ONANNUALIZED BASIS BY THE WAY ME'VE NEW INFLATION STATS OUT TO DAY AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THE SEEPIE THAT CONTUMPRYCENNEC CLIMBED THREE POINT SEVEN PER CENT IN THE YEAR THROUGH AUGUST THOT WAS FASTER THAN THE THREE PER CENT THREE POING TWO PER CENTIAL IRATING AND EVEN FASTER THEN THE THREE POINT SIX PER CENT THAT ECONOMIS HAD EXPECTED SOF CORS THARE BLAMING THIS ON HIGH GAS PRICIS WHICH MEANS THAT JOBIDEN AS GOIN TO TRY TO CUT SOME SORT OF SWEET HART THE OLD SOUTIES IN ORDER TO GET THEM TO PUMP GASIN GAN SO AS TO ARTIFICIALLY BOOST HIS REELECT CHANCES BUT THESE ARE BAD NUMBERS CAN REMEMBER WE'R'S POSTO BE SEEKING TWO PER CENT THE DIVERSINE TWO PER CENT IN THREE POINT SEVEN PERCENT WE ARE ALMOST DOUBLE THE EXPECTED IN FLATION RATE IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW AND EVEN A LOT OF DEMOCRATS ARE STARTING TO LOOK CROSS IED TO JOBIDON SAY I DON'T KNOW WHY WE ARE RUNNING THIS ONE WHY NOW THE REAL REASON THE RUNNING THIS ONE IS BECAUSE THE'RE TRYING PREVENT IN INTERNAL FIRE FIGHT OVER COMELA HARRISON SIDE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THI'S THE PROBLEM WHENYOU PICK IN A FIRMATIVE ACTION CANDIDATE FOUR V P AS AP POSE D YOU KNOW THE BEST QUALIFIED CANDIFOR TE JOBIDON COULDN'AT CHOSEN ANY ONE FOR B P COMEA HARIS DID NOT BRING OUT THE BLACKVOAT SHOU 'D NOT BRING OUT ANY ONE COMELA HARRIS IS ONE MOST ALIENATING POLITICIANS OF OUR LIFETIME IF JOBI AD WANT TO PICK LIKE A QUALIFIED V P GET A BUNCH OF PEOPLE TO CHOOSE FROM MEAN EVEN ON THAT STAGE WITH HIM WHEN HO'S RUNNING IN TWENTY TWENTY THER'R BUNCH OF PEOPLE HE EASILY COULD HAVE CHOSEN AS HIS V P CANDIDATE MOST OBVIOUSLY SOME MO LICE AMIN CLOBICHAR FROM ANSOT HE DIDN HE DECIDED NOT TO DO THAT INSTEAD HE WENT WITH COMELA HRRIS WHO'SE OFF PUTTING AND WIDELY DESPISED AND SO THE'RE TRYING PREVENT OF FIRE FIGHT FROM BREAKING OUT INSIDE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OVER COMELA AS THEY GOT  LEAVE THE OLD MAN IN PLACE BUT DEMOCRATS ARE STARING TO TAKE OP HIS PULLMUMBER SOCK WO DIVIDIGNACIOS DEMOCRAT WRITING FOR THE WASHINGTON POSED HAS AN ENTIRE PIECE TODATE THADTL PRESIDENT BIDIN SHOULD NOT RUN AGAIN IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR HE SAYS WHAT I ADMIRE MOST ABOUT PRESIDN A PIDNESS THAT IN A PULLORIZED NATION HE HAS GOVERNED FROM THE CENTER OUT WHICH OF COURSE IS A JOKE HE 'S GOVERNED FROM THE LEFT THE HARD LEFT BUT I DON'T THINK THET BIDAN IN VITES PRESIDENEN HARRIS SHOULD RUN FOR REELECTION I LOVE THAT ES SNEAKING IN THE VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS RAY THERE THIF AS PRESIDENT HARRIS COMELA HARRIS SHE IS NOT EIGHTY COMELA HARRIS IS IN THE PRIME IF HER POLITICAL LIFE AN THE'E ALL READY LIKE CAN WE LIKE DUMPER OFF THE SIDE OF THIS SHIP LIKE LEBRIG RIGHT NOW LL PUSH THE OLD MAN AND IF SHE GOES THAT WULD ALSO B GREAT I DON'T THINK BIDAN AND VICES PRESEDE IN HARRIS HOULD RUN FOR REELECTION SAYS DAVIDING NACIUS IT'S PAINFUL TO SAY THAT GIVE MY ADMIRATION FOR MUCH OF WHAT THEY'VE ACCOMPLISHED BUT IF HE AND HRRIS CAMPAGN TOGETHER IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR I THINK BIDON RISKS UNDOING HIS GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT WHICH WAS STOPPING TRUM BIDE WOULD CARRY TWO BIG LIVE BILITIES SINCE WHET TWENTY TWENTY FOUR CAMPAIGN HE BE EIGHTY TWO EN HE BEGAN A SECOND TERM THAT IS LIABILITY NUMBER ONE AND LIBILDING UMBER TO HIS HARRIS JUS A THIRTY NIME POINT FIVE PER SENTS APPROVAL RATING ACCORDING TO FIVE A THIRTY EIGHT HARRIS SAYS DAVIDING NACIUS HAS MANY LOUDABLE QUALITIES BUT THE SIMPLE FACT HISH HAS FAILED TO GAIN TRACTION IN THE COUNTRY OR EVEN WITHIN HER OWN PARTY BIDON COULD EN COURAGE A MORE OPEN V P SELECTION PROCESS THAT COULD PRODUCE A STRONGER RUNNING MATE AND THE I LOW THIS HE SAYS WE SHOULD START WITH THE MAYOR OF LOS ANGELIST CARRAN BASS ULOOK OUT LOOK OUT THAT THE INTEROSECTIONAL DEMOCRATIC CARTY THEY CAN'T KARID OF COMA HARIS CAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A BLACK WOMAN BACKER UP HIS FIRST MOVE IS WHAT ABOUT CARRON BASS WHO BARELY B RICK CRUSO WHO'S A REPUBLICAN IN ALLI OR COMMER SECRETARY GENA RAY MONDO YAT THAT THERE'D BE A CHARMER GENA RAY MONDO THE COMMER SECRETARY THAT WOITHOT'D BE AMAZING GRAGA BUT THERE THER'S THE DESPERATION IS STARTING TO SET IN AMONG THE DEMOCRATS WHICH OF COURSE IS WHY THE DMOCRATIC PARTY RIGGE THE PRIMARIES IN THE FIRST PLACE AS AR IF CA JUNIOR IS NOW POINTING OUT IN THE WALLSTER JOURNAL HE SAYS HIS BECOME CLEAR THE D N C DOESN'T WANTER RAIL PRIMARY AND IS WILLING TO DISEN FRANCHISES DEMOCRATIC VOTERS FROM CHOOSING THEIR NOMINATE THE D N CE HAS REFUSE TO HOST DEBATES THOUGH VAST MA JORITY OF DEMOCRATIC VOTERS WANT AND EXPECT THEM SO THEY CAN JUDGE WHICH CANDIDATE HAS THE POPULAR APPEAL AND VIGORTO CHALLENGE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINA THE D'ANCY HAS REVOKED NEW HAMPSIRES SENTURY OLD STATUS'S FIRST PRIMARY STATE IN THEIRE PLACEY WITH SOUTH CAROLINA GAUVSE BIDEN ONE SOUTH CAROLINA BUT LOST BOTH NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IOA THE D'ANC AS RAFTED RULES THAT IF CANDIDATES RUN IND UNSANCTION PRIMARY NEW HAMPSHIRE THE D'ANC CHAIRMAN HAS THE POWER TO PUNISH THEM REGARDLESS OF THE MARCHIN OF VICTORY SUCH A CANDIDATE WOULD RECEIVE ZERO DELEGATES FURTHER THE JEORGIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS A RULE ALLOWING IT TO BAN FROM THE BALLAT ANY KANDIDATE WHO DOESN'T FOLLOW DANC RULES SAR KGUNOR'S POINTING OUT A VEARITY RIGG THIS THING LIKE BIDON STEPPED IN AND HE RIGGED THIS THING SO DEMOCRATS ARE STUCK WITH JOBITON WHICH IS THE REASON PRESUMABLY WHY THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IS REALLY BAD FOR GOBITON AGAN IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUR BINE THAT IS GOODTHNG FOR REPUBLICANS AND IF FOU TUNG BOUT DONAL TRUMP THAT IS GOODTHING FOR DEMOCRATS THAT IS THE SIMPLE SIMPLE MAV AN JUST ONE SECOND WE CAN GET TO JO BIDONS FOIBLES OVER SEES BECAUSE WE ARE

OF COURSE WE ARE BUT IT'S NOT BAD THAT WE'RE DOING IT WHICH OF COURSE ALSO APPLIES TO WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTING TO DO IN AMERICAS PUBLIC SCHOOLS SO THE ENTIRE FIGHT THAT IS NOW HAPPENING ACROSS THE COUNTRY OVER REMOVING WILDLY INAPPROPRIATE MATERIAL FROM SCHOOL LIBRARIES BOOKS LIKE GENDR QUEER WICH ARE BASICALLY DISTPRONOGRAPHY REMOVING THESE FROM SCHOOL LIBRARIES DEMOCRATS MEN SAING THIS AFORM OF CENSORSHIP WELL THIS TURN INTO A VERY WEIRD HEARING YESTERDAY WHEN SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY OF LOUISIANA HE WAS LIKE LISTEN WONT REDULTON'S ROOM I'M TO READ INTO THE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ONE OF

ADVOCATING FOR SEXTUAL MATERIAL TO BE AVAILABLE TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL KIDS RIGHT I MEAN TACHNICALLY YOU WANTED TO BE VAILABLE IN FIFTH GRADE NOT FORTH GRADE LIKE MIDDLE SCHOOL IS WHAT YOURE SAYING NO ONE IS EVEROCATING FOR SUTUEXCLUSO CO TO TO BE AVAILABLE THENO MENTRY SCHOOL LIBRARY OR CHILDREN SICTION LIBRARY THAT'S TA DISTRACTION FROM THE REAL CHALLENGE I WHAT IT'S A DISTRACTION FROM THE REAL CHALLENGE U THAN I'VE QUESTION WHY SHOULDTHAT EVEN BE AVAILABLE IN A COLABRATE FOR HIGH SCHOOLERS WHY SHOULD TAX PARS BE FUNNING THE SORTOGRAP IF A LOCAL SCHOL DISTRICT SIDES THETN'T WANT THAT THERE WHAT BUSINESS IS IT OF DIC DURBAN TO DECIDE THAT TDAT IT MUST BE THERE WHATIS WHAT IS THE REASON WHY THAT MUST BE IS THAT A PIECE OF GREAT LITERATURE THAT IS REQUIRED FOR YOU PASTURE ENGLISH COMP CLASS I I THINK I THINK NOT AGET THEY HAVE TO DENY THEI'R DOING THE THING THEY'RE DOING NO WHERE NOT DOING IT BUT IT'S GOOD THAT WE ARE SENTEEM SEEMS TO BE THE ARGUMENT AT AT ALL TIMES FRUM THIS CRUE AT CAN MEANWHILE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE OF THE ILE SOME MOVEMENT IN THE POLES IN IOA NOWS THE THE FRONT RUNNER IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY REMAINS BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS DONALD TRUMP BUT HE HAS HEEN A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN THE IWAT REPUBLICAN CAUCUS ACCORDING TO EMERSON COLLEGE JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO HE WAS IT WELL OVER SIXTY PER CENT IN THAT POLE I IN THAT EMERSON COLLEGE POLLY'S NUNE TO FORTY NINE PER CENT WHICH THE DROP OF THIRTEEN PER CENT MEAWHILE GOVERNOR RONDOSANTIS AND MY PENCS IS NUMBERS ALSO DROP FROM MADE DE SANTS HIS NUMBERS WERE AT TWENTY PER CENT IN MAY THERE NON FOURTEEN PENCE DECRESE FROM FIVE  PER CENT TO THREE PER CENT YOU'V SEEN SOME GAINS FOR TIMSCOTT AND NICKEY HALEY AND THE VAKE ROMAS UAMMY ALL OF THEM STILL RUNNING WELL BEHIND DONALD TRUMP OBVIOUSLY RONDOSANTIS WHO REMAINS THE NATIONAL THE NATIONAL SECOND PLACE HAN AVE RUNNER UP RIGHT NOW BY ALL AVAILABLE PULL METRIC HE APPEARED WITH NORAH O'DONALD LAST NIGHT AND HOU'S TALKING BOUT THE AGE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES OBVIOUSLY THIS DOESN'T JUSTIPLY JOBINAT OBVIOUSLY ALSO APPLIES TO DONALD TRUMP AGE HAS BECOME AN ISSUE IN THIS PRESIDENTTIAL CONTEST SHOULD VOTER IS WORRY ABOUT THE AGES OF PRESIENT BON ON FOMAL PRESIDENT DONAL TROPHIC I ABSOLUTELY LEGITIMATE CONCERN THE PRESENTS HE'S NOT A JOB PER SOME ONE THAT'S EIGHTY YEARS OLD THAN THERE'S NOTHING AND A WRONG WITH BEING ATHE OFFICE THE OM THE GOVERNOR FLORIDA I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE ELDERLY THEIR GEAT PEOPLE BUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A JOB WERE YOU NEED TO GIVE IT A HUNDER PER CENT YOU NEE WE NEEDN'T ENERGETIC PRESIDENT AND I THINK THAT IF THE FOUNDERS COULD COULD KIND OF LOOK AT THIS AGAIN I DO THINK THEY PROBABLY WOULD AV PUT IN AGE LIMIT AH ON SOME OF THESE OFFICES GET THAT THAT A'LL MADE VERY WELL BE TRUE HERE IS THE REALITY INSIDE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY THAT SOME ONE IS GOING TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP I CANT THERIAN TO HAVE TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING CASE DONALD TRUMP LOST IN TWENTY TWENTY AND I WILL NOT THAT IS THE ONLY CASE THAT YOU CAN MAKE THAT IS THE ONLY CASE THET COM BE MADE IS ON HME ABOUT AGE IS IN HIM GAT TEMPERAMENT BECAUSE REPUBLICANS VERY MUCH HANT OF LIKE DONAL TRUMS COMBAT OF TEMPERAMENT AND SOME THE WILD STUFF ON TRUE SOCIAL THT DON'T MIND IT THAT THE CAND OF ENJOY IT THE THNK IT'S FUN IT IS NOT HIM DONE ON THE BASES OF RECORD BECAUSE MOST REPUBLICANS THINK THA DONAL TRUMPS RECKOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF HIS PRESENT AS HE WAS GOOD EVEN IF HE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING WITH THE BURACRACY IN FACT THAT SHLLY CHALK UP TO HIS BENEFIT SIDE THE FACT THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON TOE BURAH RECSY BECAUE THEN THEY SAY THAT BURACRACY TRIED TO THWART HIM AND LOOK AT ALL THE THINGS THAT HE GOT DONE IN THE FACE OF THAT PURACRASY HE'LL DEFINITELY TO A BETTER NEXT TIME THE ONLY WAY ANY REPUBLICAN IS GOING TO BE DON TRUMP IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES IS BY MAKING A VERY SIMPLE CASE YOU LOST IN TWENTY TWENTY TWA DEAD MAN YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE AGAIN IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TO A DEAD MAN YOU'RE GOING TO SPENDTHE ENTIRE YEAR LOCKD UP IN QORT YOU'E GOING T BE WHINING ON TRUTH SOCIALLYOU NO CAN SPEND A DOLLAR ON ACTUAL ELECTIONEERING OU'RE NOT TO SPEND FIVE MINUTES OUTSIDE OF MARLOGO OR OFF A TRUTH SOCIAL AND THOSE ARE ALL OBSTACLES TO YOU WINNING THE PRESIDENCY SOMEBODY IS GOING O HAVE TO MAKE THAT CASE THE PROBLEM IS I THINK ALL THE REPUBLICANS IN THE RACE ARE AFRAID TO MAKE THAT CASE BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THAT IF THEY SAY THAT TRUMP LOST IN TWENTY TWENTY THEYR ENTIRE AUDIENCE ISGINGTO DISAPPEAR BUT HERE'S A THING IF TONS FROM ONE N TWENTY TWENTY OF COURSE WE SHOULD NOMINAT HM AN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR HEITHER WONERE WASS FOR THERE'S NO THIRD POSSIBILITY SO IF YEU LOST IN TWNTY TWENTY WE SHOULD POBABLY RUN SOMODY ELSE IS HE LOST AND IF YE WON AND TWENTY TWENTY WE SHOULD FOR SURE RUN HIM BECAUSE HE WILL WIN AGAIN RIGHT THIS IS THE ENTIRE DEBATE AND IF NO REPUBLICAN IS WILLING TO SAVE THE OBVIOUS WHICH IS TRUMP LOST IN TWENTY TWENTY CAUSE WE DIDN'T KEEP BE IN THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW NOT SIGNING CRAP YOR ONDULS WELL THEN WHO THE HELSGAN OVERTAKE HIM IN PRIMARY O MEANWHILE I HAVE LEARNED ACCORDING TO REPORTS FOR MY PRODUCERS THAT DOES SOMETHNG ALL THE

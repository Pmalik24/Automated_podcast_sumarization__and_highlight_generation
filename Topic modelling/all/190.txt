BUT HE THINKS THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO TALK ABOUT MICKE HALY HE HAS THIS CAUTIOUS REPROACH PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF THIS THING PEOPLE KEEP SAING AROUND YURE ALL THE TIME YOU HAMPSHIRE VOTERS HAVE TO MAKE UP THEIR OWN MIND DON'T PRESSURE ME SO CAN BE HARD TO TELL HOW HE'S ACTUALLY DOING WITH THIS CROWD EVEN THOUGH THIS WOMAN SAYS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO HER IS TO STOP TRUNK BUT YOU STILL DON'T KNOW

STOP TRUMP WE GOT ABOUTIN  WU GAT WEVEN AV ATS FOR SOMEBODY DON' L NO AND WITH THAT THE VOTER HAS TO GO T WE MOVE ON THIS STRATEGY GETTING PEOPLE TO HATE VOTE FOR NICKY HAILY THERE'S A WORD SOME PEOPLE USED FOR THIS KIND OF THING A TECHNICAL TERM OF POLITICS FOR SNEAKING ROUND AND DOING DIRTY TRICKS INSIDE THE OTHER PARTY'S ELECTION HERE'S CAN CELLIN TATED THAT THIS IS THE MUST AGONIZE THA LUCKING OPERATIAN ABOUT THAT I FAN HEM AT THAT TIM EY AE TA YOU THAT YI A BUT WDON'T SEE OURSELFS SATISFAT A W IT YOU FEEL I OEMEN NI I BELIEVE IT WAS A COMPLIMENT YES YE IT IS  WE OM IAN  THIS WHOLE QUEST OF ROBET IN KENS BEGAN ONE NIGHT LAST SUMMER THEY MET UP IN DECEE AND GOT ONTO THE SUBJECT OF HOW THEY THINK TRUMP IS AN EXCISTENTIAL THREAT TO DEMOCRACY  CAN WE GET OFF THE ROAD TO AUTOCRACY AND CAN WAS LIKE WOU KNOW YOU HAVE DONE STUFF IN THE PAST TIL I HELP OTHER COUNTRIES IN THIS SITUATION MAYBE WE SHOULD ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING CAN I THINK GIVIN HIS LIKE CAN OF CONSULTING BACONAS LIKE LET'S DO A BRAINSTERM AND THIS IS HOW YOU DO A RANS TOA RATHER TIK ROTHES I YEELL CN I TELL HER ABOUT YOUR OTHER IDEA THAT WE CAN CAN HAS SOME REALLY GOOD IDEAS AND SOM NOT SO REALLY GOOD IDEAS AND SO THE OTHER IDEA HE TRIED TO PITCH ME ON THAT WE CAN WAS THIT THE NATIONAL FOPUTIG IS TOO DANGEROUS AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE IS LAST HALF OF EMAC AS FIN SO WE HAVE WE HAVE LET'S LET'S CREATE A SEVEN ON SEVEN FOOTBALL THE THAT IS MORE SAKE AND AND ROBERT TOLD HIM THOT WAS RIDICULOUS T AN  THERE'S THE SORT OF PERSON CAN IS AND THEN HE PULLS OUT A POWERPOIT SOI YES LIK A DEFER YET I  EV FORTFOLLY AND AS LIKE THAT AS LIKE THIS IS GIVING ME SERIOUS DOUBTS THAT WE SHOULD PROCEED ALONG THIS FRET BUT HE STILL ACTUALLY BELIEVE THE SEGE YEI ET SO ANYWAY AFTER THEY GOT THIS IDEA FOR DEFEETING TRUMP THEY WENT OUT AND RAISED MONEY AND THEY SAY THEY RAISED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON THEIR OWN ND THEN THEY GOT THIS BIG CHUNK OF SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM DONTERS WHO WISHD TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS AND THAT'S REAL MONEY THAT COULD HAVEIT IN PACT ON SMALL BUT MIGHTY ELECTION LIKE THIS ONE WITH THAT MONEY THEY BOUGHT TARGETED VOTER LISTS OF UNDECLARED LEFT LEANING VOTERS THAT THEY REGULARLY MESSAGE AND SEND NAILERS OUT TO MAILERS AND MESSAGES THAT CAN IS GOT IN FOCUS CRUP AND TESTED WITH PROFESSIONALS THEY GOT A LUCKY BRAK WHEN NICKY HAILY STARTED TO POLL WITHIN TEN POINTS OF DONALD TRUMP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SO WRIT IT THIS MOMENT GOING TO THE IOF A CAWKAS THEIR HOPE IS SOU'D COME AN SECK IN AN ILA THOT WOUD GIVEHER THE MOMENTUM TO WIN NEW HAMPSHIRE OUTRIGHT BEAT TRUMP WICH WOULD MAKE HER CREDIBLE IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND BEYOND THAT THEY EVEN HIRED TWO PEOPLE IN SOUTH CAROLINA IN CASE THEY HAVE A SHOP THERE WE ALWAYS SAW THIS IS HIREST CI REWARD THI IF YEU LIKE AT THE PULLS IT HAS ALWAYS LOOKED LIKE TRUMP WILL WIN DENOMINATION BUT IF THERE'S A FIVE PER CENT CHANCE OF STOPPING APOTENTIAL DICTATER THIT IT'S WORTH PUTTING A LAT THAFIT INTO THAT YEVE FOR THAT FIVE PER CENT CHANCE TIT LIKE HAILY SHOCKS TRUMP HERE AND THERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE IN THE REPUBLIC LIKE IT'S WORTH IT FOR OUR DEMOCRACY ROBERT IS REALLY EMOTIONALLY INVESTED IN THIS IDEA THAT MABE THEY THESE TWO COLLEGE FRIENDS COULD ACTUALLY DO SOME THING TO STOP DONAL TRUMP HE'S INTENSE ABOUT HIS WORK ALWAYS GET'S OVERLY INVESTED IT SEEMS AT HIS DAY JOB HE WAS WAKING UP HAVING PANIC ATTACKS ABOUT THAT WORK ON TOP OF THIS WORKI WAS LIKE IS THIS WORK HELPING NOW THIS IS NOT EXTREMELY HEALTHY EITHER AM I TIED MYSELF INTO MY CAREER AND THEN RATHER THAN SEEK BALANCE AND VIEW MYSELF AS A FATHER IN A BROTHER IN A SON AND INSTEAD OF THAT I HAVE NOW IDENTIFIED MYSELF AS A PART OF THIS LIKE MISSION AND I'M WRAPPED UP IN THAT IN MY WHOLE SELF WORTH IS GOING TO BE DETERMINED JANUARY TWENTY THIRD AND THAT'S NOT HEALTHY AT ALL SO I'M REALLY WORRIED FROM A MENT LIKE FROM A MENTAL HEALTH IN ALL THAT PERSPECTIVE OF LIKE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER JANUARY TWENTY THIRD OR WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER LIKE

THAT'S WHY I ONE I HAVE THE CORNFIELDS BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT LIKE IT'S EDGY IT'S INSULTING TI WAS INN   AND AT MY LAST VOTERS O NEW HAMPSHIRE LATER THAT DAY ROBERT BROUGHT ME TO MEET THIS COUPLE IN A LOVELY HOUSE ON A SNOWY STREET IN MAMPCHESTER HE WANT TO RUN THE CORNFIELD TEX MESSAGES BY GEORGE BRUNO FOR MHER DEMOCRATIC HARTY CHAIR AGAIN GEORGE HAD VOLUNTEERED TO BE A PUBLIC CHAMPION OF ROBERT'S CAUSE AND ROBERT HAD MANAGED TO CONVINCE THIS AURGUST NEW HAMPSHIRE AND TO PUBLICLY CHANGE HIS PARTY REGISTRATION FROM DEMOCRAT TO UNDECLARED OONLY PROBLEM WAS GEORGE STILL HADN'T DECIDED

COMMIT TO DOING THE THING CROSSING PARTIES VOTING TO SAVE AMERICA THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY BUT THEN ROBERT TURNED TO GEORGE'S WIFE RONA WHO BEEN IN THE KITCHEN WHILE WE BEEN TALKING ROFFERN TEA AND READING THE NEW YORK TIMES SHE CHANGED HER PARTY REGISTRATION TO UNDECLARED TOS ROBERT ASKED HER WHAT SHE WAS THINKING SHE SAID SHE'D NEVER VOTE FOR SOME ONE WHO DIDN'T BELIEVE IN REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS ROBERT SAID EVEN THOUGH TRUMP KILLED OFF ROVERSE'S WEIT SHE SAID WILL THAT'S A GOOD POINT ACTUALLY NO MY ORIGINAL AFTENT AND CROSSING OVER WAS TO A SURE THAT TRUMP WOULD NOT BECOME PRESENT IN A VERY MER AND DEAR TO A MY VALUES IS THE ABILITY FOR WOMEN TO CONTROL THEIR OWN BODIES IN THE REPRODUCTIVE RITES SO A IT WOULD BE HARD FOR ME TO CAST TO VOTE FOR SOMEBODY WHO MIGHT NOT RESPECT THAT ON THE OTHER HAND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO ASSURE THAT HE IS NOT THE CANDIDATE TIT IS NAT PRESENT YOU'RE STILL SOIN MIGHT HAVE BEEN I MIGHT HAVE TO COMPROMISE WOULD YOU VOTE FOR NIKAILY SHE'S THE ONE THAT ACCORDING TO THE POLES LOOKS THE MOST LIKELY TO BE TRUMP RIGHT AM RECENTLY I READ SOME OF HER STANCES AND SHE WAS REALLY WUFFLING ON REPRODUCTIVE RICES SO SCARED ME A ON THE OTHER HAND I DID THIS PRIMARILY TO DEFEAT TRUMP SO IF IT MEAND VOTING FOR HER I MIGHT DO IT YOU HAVE LE WORTIME TO DAAS IS SALL TURED OUT ITI JUST BECAUSE IT'S SUCH AN UNCOMFORTABLE  THOUGHT BUT I WANTED TO FEAT TRUMP AND IF IT TAKES FLOTING FOR NICKIHALLY TO DO THAT I THINK I MIGHT DO THAT YOU KNOW I THINK SHE MIY REALLY DO IT WHEN I LEFT NEW HAMPSHIRE IT WAS HALF WAY THROUGH AMERICA'S MAGICAL EIHTY PERIOD BETWEEN I WAS CAUKASES AND NEUW HAMPTUROUS PRIMARIES ROBERT SEEMED TO SWING FROM HAPPILY CHERRY PICKING POLES THAT TOLD HIM WHAT HE WANTED TO HEAR TO DESPAIR AND REAL FEAR THAT THEY HAD NO CHANCE AND TRUMP COULDN'T BE STOPPED BY ANY ONE HE TOLD ME HE WOKE UP CRYING ON THURSDAY MORNING THIS MIGHT ALL BE OVER IN A FEW DAYS HE SAID THE ALAMA THE PROJECT WAS A LONG SHOT FROM THE START THEY DID THEIR BEST AND NOW SINCE TRUMPS OVERWHELMING WHEN AND I WA IT GONE WAY LONGSHOT HERE SO WAS IT WORTH IT IF TRUMP WINS BY FIFTEEN OR TWENTY POINTS I WILL VIEW EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE AS A FAILURE AND LIKE AN I WILL CONSIDER MYSELF A FAILURE AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT LIKELE'R DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN AND IT'S NOT AND I NEED TO BE LIKE THIS THEY TELL YOU YOU HAVE TO BE LIKE NICER TO YOURSELF AND TELL SPEAK TO YOU LIKE

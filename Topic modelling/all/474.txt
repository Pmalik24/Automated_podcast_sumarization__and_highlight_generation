WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAPO A SCIENCE SCIENCEPACE TO  I MAY DREW HUBERMAN AND OM OUR PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TODAY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF HEAT AND MORE SPECIFICALLY THE SCIENCE OF HEA TING THE VERB MEANING HOW OUR BODY HEATS UP FROM BOTH THE OUTSIDE AND THE INSIDE HEAT IS A REMARKABLE STIMULUS MEANING WHEN WE ARE IN A HOT ENVIRONMENT IT HAS A PROFOUND EFFECT ON OUR BIOLOGY END HEATING UP FROM THE OUTSIDE OR AS YOU WILL SOON LEARN FROM THE INSIDE HAS A PROFOUND EFFECT ON MANY DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF OUR HEALTH INCLUDING OUR METABOLISM BOTH IN THE IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM OUR COGNITION MEANING OUR ABILITY TO THINK MORE OR LESS CLEARLY AND IF YOUARE IMMEDIATELY THINKING THAT HEATING UP MAKES YOU LESS CAPABLE OF THINKING YOURE WRONG HEAT APPLIED PROPERLY AS A STIMULUS CAN ENGAGE CERTAIN NARRO CHEMICAL SYSTEMS IN YOUR BRAIN EN BODY THAT CAN ALLOW YOUR BRAIN TO FUNCTION FAR BETTER WE WILL TALK ABOUT THOSE DATA TO DAY SO WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF HEAT AND HEATING BOTH IN TERMS OF THEIR MECHANISMS AND AS I KNOW MANY OF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THE TOOLS RELATED TO THE USE OF HEAT THINGS LIKE SANA HOW OFTEN TO DUSANA HOW LONG TO BE IN THE SANA HOW HOT TO BE IN THE SANA FOR PARTICULAR GOALS AND OUTCOMES WE ARE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE VERY EXCITING NEW SCIENCE AROUND LOCAL HEATING THAT IS THE USE OF HEAT APPLIED TO SPECIFIC AREAS OF THE BODY IN ORDER TO HEAL OR IMPROVE TISSUES AT THAT LOCATION THAT YOU ARE HEATING AS WELL AS YOUR BIOLOGY AND HEALTH OVER ALL IN FACT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ONE VERY RECENTLY PUBLISHED PAPER THAT CAME OUT IN THE JOURNAL CELL SELL IS ONE OF THE THREE APEX JOURNALS MEANING THREE OF THE MOST COMPETITIVE MOST RIGOROUS SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS THOSE ARE NATURE SCIENCE AND SELL THIS PARTICULAR PAPER WAS PUBLISHED IN CELL AND I WILL GO INTO IT IN MORE DETAIL LATER BUT BASICALLY WHAT THIS PAPER SHOWS IS THAT BY LOCALLY HEATING UP SKIN AND FAT YOU CAN CHANGE THE IDENTITY OF CERTAIN FAT CELLS AT THAT LOCATION AND ELSEWHERE WE HAVE THREE KINDS OF FAT WHITE FAT BASE FAT AND BROWN FAT AND AS YOU WILL LEARN MORE ABOUT SOON WHITE FAT IS NOT VERY METABOLICALLY ACT OF ITS MORE OF A FUEL RESERVE IS WHAT WE TYPICALLY THINK OF AS BLOVERY FAT BASE FAT AND BROWN FAT ARE RICH IN MITOCONDRIA AND THOSE MITA CONDRE UP PROVIDE A SORT OF FURNACE OR HEATING MECHANISM FOR YOUR ENTIRE BODY AN INCREASE YOUR METABOLISM AND THE BURNING OF WHITE FAT SO INOTHER WORDS HAVING MORE BASE FAT AND BROWN FAT IS A GOOD THING AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THE PROPER APPLICATION OF HEAT TO SPECIFIC AREAS OF YOUR BODY CAN INCREASE THE CONVERSION OF WHITE FAT TO BASE FAT IN OTHER WORDS TURN AN INOCUOUS FUEL SOURCE IN TO A METABOLICALLY ACTIVE TISSUE THAT CAN HELP YOU BURN OFF MORE WHITE FAT THINK MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE INTERESTED IN THIS PAPER AND THE TOOLS THAT EMERGE FROM THIS PAPER IT'S A FASCINATING SET OF FINDINGS THAT ACTUALLY EMERGED FROM HE UNDERSTANDING OF THE BIOLOGY OF BURN AND PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE INTENSE BURNS AND THAT IS NOT WHAT I'M GOING TO RECOMMEND TO YOU AS A TOOL OF COURSE BUT UNDERSTANDING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW BURNS IMPACT OUR BIOLOGY AND HEALTH HAS ALLOWED THESE PIONEERING RESEARCHERS TO DEVELOP NEW TOOLS TO COMBAT OBISITY AND METABOLIC DISORDERS AND THAT YOU CAN APPLY FOR BASIC THINGS LIKE FATLOSTS I'M PLEASE TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE HUBERMAN LABPODCAST IS NOW PARTNERED WITH MOMENTOUS SUPPLEMENTS OUR MOTIVATION FOR PARTNERING WITH MOMENTOUS IS TO PROVIDE PEOPLE ONE LOCATION WHERE THEY CAN GO TO ACCESS THE HIGHEST QUALITY SUPPLEMENTS IN THE SPECIFIC DOSAGES THAT OUR BEST SUPPORTED BY THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND THAT ARE DISCUSSED DURING VARIOUS EPISODES OF THE HUBERMAN LAT PODCAST IF YOU GO TO LIVEMOMENTOUS TOCKCAM SLASH HUBERMEN YOU WILL SEE THOSE FORMULATIONS I SHOULL MENTION THAT WE ARE GOING TO ADD MORE FORMULATIONS IN THE MONTHS TO COME AND YOU WILL SEE SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS ABOUT HOW BEST TO TAKE THOSE SUPPLEMENTS MEANING WHAT DOSAGES AND TIMES OF DAY AND IN FACT HOW TO COMBINE THOSE SUPPLEMENTS WITH SPECIFIC BEHAVIORAL PROTOCALS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED ON THE PODCAST AND OUR SCIENCE SUPPORTED IN ORDER TO DERIVE THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT FROM THOSE SUPPLEMENTS AND MANY OF YOU WILL PROBABLY ALSO BE PLEASED TO LEARN THAT MOMENTOUS SHIPS NOT JUST WITHIN THE UNITED STATES BUT ALSO INTERNATIONALLY SO ONCE AGAIN IF YOU GO TO LIVE MOMENTOUS STOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN YOU WILL FIND WHAT WE FIRMLY BELIEVE TO BE THE BEST QUALITY SUPPLEMENTS IN THE PRECISE DOSAGES AND THE BEST PROTOCALS FOR TAKING THOSE SUPPLEMENTSALONG WITH THE IDEAL BEHAVORO PROTOCALS TO COMBINE WITH THE SUPPLEMENT FORMULATIONS BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EPHISIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCHROLS T STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART

TALK MANY TIMES WEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLYTES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOES ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH

GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN OKE LET'S TALK ABOUT HEAT MORE SPECIFICALLY LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF HEAT AND HEATING AND THE HEALTH BENEFITS AND TOOLS RELATED TO HEAT AND HEATING THE FIRST QUESTION THAT WE HAVE TO ANSWER IS HOW DO WE HEAT UP AND THE ANSWERS TO THAT QUESTION IS WE HEAT UP TWO WAYS WE HEAT UP FROM THE OUTSIDE MEANING THE THINGS THAT WE COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE CLOTHING THAT WE PUT ON OUR BODY WHETHE'RE NOT THEIRS HEAT IN THE ROOM OR WHETHER NO ITS COLD OUTSIDE OR COLD IN A ROOM AND WE HEAT UP FROM THE INSIDE OUR BODY HAS THE CAPACITY DEGENERATE MORE HEAT OR TO COOL DOWN MEAN TO TURN OFF THE HEATING PROCESS AND IT CAN DO THAT IN WAYS THAT MATCH THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT THE SIMPLEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TWO BODY TEMPERATURES AND PEOPLE SAY OH WHAT'S PODY TEMPERATURE NINETY EIGHT POINT SIX THAT'S ASHY NOT TRUE BODY TEMPRATURE VARIES BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS  VARIES ACROSS TIME OF DAY WITHININDIVIDUALS AND AT EVERY POINT CROSS YOUR ENTIRE LIFE SPIN YOU HAVE TWO DISTINCT TEMPERATURES ONE IS THE TEMPERATURE ON YOUR SKIN WHAT SCIENTISTS CALL YOUR SHELL AND THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR CORE YOUR VISERA MEANING YOUR ORGANS YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IN YOUR SPINAL CORD AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR C ORE IS ALWAYS HIGHER THAN THE TEMPERATURE AT YOUR SURFACE SO THE IMPORTANTHING TO KNOW IS THAT YOU HAVE A TEMPERATURE AT YOUR SHELL AND THE TEMPERATURE YOUR CORE NAW YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THOSE TEMPERATURES ARE IN MOST CASES BUT IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE THOSE TWO TEMPERATURES AND THAT YOUR BRAIN IS CONSTANTLY SENDING OUT SIGNALS TO YOUR BODY AS TO WEATHER NOT IT SHOULD HEAT UP ORE COOL DOWN DEPENDING ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SHELL WHICH MAKES TOTAL SENSE THIS IS A LOT LIKE A THERMASTAT IN A ROOM WHICH IS SENCH A PAYING ATTENTION TO HOW COLD ARE HOT IT IS AND THEN SENDING SIGNALS TO THE HEATING YOUR COOLING SYSTEM TO EITHER HEAT UP THE ENVIRONMENT OR COOL DOWN THE ENVIRONMENT DEPENDING ON THE TEMPERATURE IN THAT ENVIRONMENT YOUR BRAIN HAS NURONS THAT SEND SIGNALS TO OTHER CELLS IN YOUR BODY AND DEPLOY THE RELEASE OF CHEMICALS IN YOUR BRAIN ON BODY TO HEAT YOU UP WHEN YOU ARE TOO COLD AND TO COOL YOU DOWN WHEN YOU ARE TOO HOT SO IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE TOO BODY TEMPERATURES WANT AT YOUR SHELL THE SURFACE AND WANT AT YOUR CORE INSIDE AND THAT YOUR BODY AND BRAIN ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO BALANCE THOSE TWO TEMPERATURES IN THE APPROPRIATE WAY WELL THEN YOUR HALF WAY THERE TO UNDERSTANDING THE BIOLOGY OF THERMAL REGULATION AND HEATING AND YOU'LL BE A LOT FURTHER ALONG IN UNDERSTANDING HOW SPECIFIC TOOLS CAN BE USED TO IMPROVEMENTABOLISM OR IMPROVE COGNITION FOR INSTANCE IN FACT LATER YOUWILL LEARN THAT ONE WAY THAT YOU CAN HEAT UP IS BY COOLING DOWN THE SURFACE OF YOUR BODY THAT'S RIGHT IF I WERE TO THROW A COL TALEL ICE COAL TELEL ON TO YOUR TORE SO RIGHT NOW AND ASK YOU WELL HOW DO YOU FEEL YOUD SAY HOW THAT'S COLD THAT'S CHILLY HOWEVER BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN IS ACTING LIKE A BIT OF A THERMASTAT AS THE SURFACE THE SHELL OF YOUR BODY FELL COOL IT WOULD MAKE SENSE THAT THAT THERMISTAT WOULD ACTIVATE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT WOULD HEAT UP YOUR CORE SIMILARLY IF I WERE TO PUT YOU INTO A VERY HOT ENVIRONMENT YOU'D SAY OH WOW IT'S REALLY REALLY WARM IN HERE BUT YOUR BRAIN IN YOUR BODY WOULD GO THROUGH A LOT OF EFFORT TO ACTIVATE MECHANISMS TO COOL YOU DOWN SO ANY TIME OR THING ABOUT HEAT MEANING DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE THINGS LIKE SANA IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND NOT JUST THE STIMULUS HOW HOT SOMETHING IS HOW LONG YOU'RE INASANA ET CETERA BUT THE EFFECT THAT HAS ON YOUR SHELL AND ON YOUR CORE IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CAN DESIGN PROTOCALS THAT ARE LITERALLY PERFECT FOR YOUR GOALS AND AS A FINAL POINT ABOUT THIS IF YOU WANT TO DEVELOP THE BEST TOOLS LEVERAGING HEAT FOR YOUR BIOLOGY AND HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND HEAT AS A PROCESS AS A VERB AS HEAT HING NOT JUST HEAT BECAUSE THERE'S THE TEMPERATURE THAT YOU ARE AT BE FORE YOU ENCOUNTER THE HEAT STIMULUS BEFORE YOU GET IN THE SONA FOR INSTANCE JURING THE HEAT STIMULUS A WILIUR IN THE SONA AND THEN AFTERWARD EVERYTHING IN BIOLOGY IS A PROCESS SO AS YOU'LL SOON LEARN THAT THERE IS A SPECIFIC SAN A PROTOCAL THAT CAN ALLOW YOU CAN ALLOW ANYBODY IN FACT TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF GRO WTH HORMON RELEASED INTO THEIR BRAIN AN BODY SIXTEENFOLD THAT'S RIGHT SIXTEENFOLD HOWEVER IT INVOLVES SHIFTING FROM A HOT ENVIRONMENT TO A COOL ENVIRONMENT TO A HOT ENVIRONMENT TO A COOL ENVIRONMENT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN OVER A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE IT ENGAGES A SWITCH A PROCESS THAT COMPOUNDS IT BUILDS ON ITSELF TO INCREASE GROWTH HARMON FRTHER AND FURTHER IN FACT IF YOU WERE TO JUST GET INTO A SONA FOR A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND CRANK UP THE TEMPERATURE TO MATCH THE EXACT TEMPERATURE THAT WAS USED IN THAT STUDY YOU WOULD NOT EXPERIENCE THOSE INCREASES IN GROWTH HORMON IT REALLY IS THE TRANSITION BETWEEN HOT AND COOL TEMPERATURES THAT ENGAGE THE PROCESS OF HEATING AND REHEATING OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO TO DAY YOU'RE GON TO LEARN ABOUT THE USE OFSANA YOU'RE GONG TO LEARN TY ABOUT THE USE OF OTHER HEAT RELATED TOOLS FOR HEALTH AND OPTIMISATION NOT JUST FOR GROWTH HORMON BUT ALSO MENABOLIC HEALTH FOR CONTROL IN CORT IS ALL EVEN TO IMPACT MENTAL HEALTH IN POSITIVE WAYS AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE MECHANISMS OF HOW YOU HEAT UP AND HOW YOU COOL DOWN WEAR THE CELLS AND CIRCUITS ARE IN THE BRAIN AND BODY HOW THOSE SELLS IN CIRCUITS WORK I PROMISE TO MAKE THE DESCRIPTION OF THAT WHICH FOLLOWS VERY CLEAR EVEN  YOU DON'T HAVE A BACKGROUND IN BIOLOGY AND ONCE YOU HAVE THAT IN HAND ALONG WITH THE UNDERSTANDING YOU NOW HAVE ABOUT THE FACT THOY YA GOT A SHELL AND A CORE AND YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT BOTH THE SHELL AND THE CORE WILL THEN YOU WILL BE IN THE BEST POSSIBLE POSITION TO YUSANA OR HOT TUB OR OTHER TOOLS EVEN JUST A HOT SHOWER AS A POWERFUL STIMULUS TO OPTIMIZE YOUR BIOLOGY NOW THE SCIENCE OF HEAT AND HEATING AND COLD AND COOLING FOR THAT MATTER GOES BACK WELL OVER A HUNDRED YEARS IN FACT IT'S KIND OF AMUSING TO ME THAT NOWADAYS THERE'S A KIND OF RENEWED INTEREST IN THE USE OF HEAT AND COLD AND THE SCIENCE OF HEAT AND COLD BECAUSE THIS WAS THE FIRST TOPIC THAT I STUDIED AS AN UNDERGRADUATE AND IN FACT I DID MY GRADUATE THESIS ON THERMAL REGULATION AND AT THE TIME THERMAL REGULATION WASN'T REALLY CONSIDERED ONE OF THE HOT TOPICS IN NAURO SCIENCE PEOPLE ARE MORE FOCUSED ON THINGS LIKE MEMORY AND CONSCIOUSNESS AND E CORSE THOSE TOPICS ARE STILL A VITAL INTEREST TO MANY PEOPLE IN MANY LABORATORIES BUT THERMAL REGULATION WAS CONSIDERED MORE YOU KNOW A THING FOR THE PHYSIOLOGIST NOWADAYS NOTJUST ON SOCIAL MEDIA NOTJUST IN THE LANDSCAPE OF BIOHACKERS IN ATHLETES BUT IN THE LANDSCAPE A MENTAL HEALTH AND FRANKLY IN THE GENERAL ETHOS AROUND HEALTH OPTIMIZATION PEOPLE ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN HEAT AND COLD AND THE REASON THE'RE SO INTERESTED IN HEAT AND COLD IS THAT A LOT OF TE SCIENCE HAS BEEN DONE BOTH IN ANIMAL MODELS AND MICE AND IN HUMANS AND TRANSLATES IMMEDIATELY TO PROTOCAULS THAT ANY ONE CAN USE NOW A BRIEF WARNING NOW AND ANOTHER BRIEF WARNING LATER ANY TIME YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HEATING UP YOUR BODY YOU NEED TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS BECAUSE UNLIKE COOLING DOWN WHERE YOU HAVE A VERLY BROAD RANGE OF COLD TEMPERATURES THAT YOU CAN GO INTO BEFORE ITS DAMAGING TO TISSUE WELL YOU DON'T GET TO HEAT UP THE BRAIN AND BODY VERY MUCH BEFORE YOU START GETTING INTO THE REALM OF NURON DAMAGE AND NURONS IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SISTEM THE BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD ONCE THEIR DAMAGE THEY DON'T COME BACK SO HYPER THERMY AS A SERIOUS THING TO AVOID LATER I'LL TALK ABOUT WAYS TO RAPIDLY PROTECT AGAINST HYPERTHERMIA BUT I DO WANT TO GIVE EVERYBODY A CAUTIONARY NOTE UT FRONT OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'R PRAGNENT NERSING IF YOU'RE VERY SENSITIVE TO HOT ENVIRONMENTS YOU WANT TO STAY OUT OF SANAS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT I'M SURE THEIRE EXCEPTIONS TO THAT YOU DEFINALLY HAVE TO TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU'RE GOING TO VIOLATE THAT RULE AND FOR EVERYBODY YOU WANT TO APPROACH ANY KIND OF TOOL RELATED TO HEATING VERY CAUTIOUSLY YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE THE TEMPERATURE LATER SO PROCEED WITH CAUTION BE SMART ABOUT I DON'T YOU SAY THAT TO PROTECT ME I SAY THAT ALSO TO PROTECT YOU SO NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE CIRCUITS FOR HEATING UP HOWS IT HAPPEN I MANY OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY EXPERIENCE TO FEVER HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO INTO A COLD ENVIRONMENTS AND YOUR SHIVERING BUT YOU PUT ON A COAT AND THEN YOU FEEL WARMER WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON THERE WELL THERE'S A VERY BASIC CIRCUIT MEANING NURONS THAT EXIST IN THE SKIN IN THE BRAIN AND THE BODY THAT COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER THAT ALLOW YOU TO HEAT UP IF YOU NEED TO IN COOL DOWN IF YOU NEED TO I MEAN TO THROW A LITTLE BIT OF NOMING CLATURE A FEW NEW WORDS AT YOU YOU DON'T NEED TO MEMORIZE THESE WORDS EXCEPT FOR ONE AS HLOU NEED TO MEMORIZE ONE ACRNYM BUT IT'S VERY EASY CALLED THE P O A IF YOU REMEMBER P OA YOU BE HOME FREE FOR THE REST OF THE EPISODE BUT I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME PHACIANATOES OUT THERE AND PEOPLE INTERESTED IN GETTING A LITTLE BIT DEEPER MECHANISM AND I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THIS CIRCUIT BECAUSE ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND THIS CIRCUIT AND THE WAY IT STRUCTURED THEN YOU ARE GOING O BE IN A GREAT POSITION TO USE THE TOOLS RELATE THE HEAT ID SO HERE'S HOW THE CIRCUIT IS STRUCTURED YOU HAVE THIS SHELL WHICH IS BASICALLY SKIN AND WITHIN THE SKIN YOU HAVE NURONS NERVE CELLS THOSE NERVE CELLS HAVE CHANNELS OR RESCEPTERS ON THEM THEY'RE CALLED TRIP CHANNELS THERE SOME OTHER ONES AS WELL WHICH BASICALLY SENTS CHANGES IN HEAT SO IF I WERE TO PUT A HOT OBJECT ON YOUR HAND OR YOUR ARM OR FOR INSTANCE IF I WERE TO PUT A HOT OBJECT ON YOUR HAND OR ARM AND THEN REMOVE THAT HOT OBJECT THOSE NURONS WOULD RESPOND TO THAT THEY WOULD SEND ELECTRICAL SIGNALS INTO YOUR SPINAL CORD AND THAT'S WHERE THE NEXT STATION OF THE CIRCUIT RESIDES IN YOUR SPINAL CORD YOU GOT A CLUSTER OF NURONS EXISTS OT THE TOP PART OF YOUR SPINAL CORD OLL THE DORSAL HORN THE NAME AGAIN DOESN'T MATTER AND THOSE NURON SPECIFICALLY RELAY HEAT INFORMATION UP TO ANOTHER AIR OF YOUR BRAIN NOW HERES WHERE WE GET INTO SOME FANCY NAMES IT'S THE LATTERAL PAROBRAKIAL ARIA YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW LATO PEROBRACIO AREA BUT IT'S A RELAYSTATION THE LATTER PEROBREAKT ARIA SENDS ELECTRICAL SIGNALS TO THE P O A AND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO KNOW P O A THE P OA STANDS FOR PRE OPTIC AREA NURONS IN THE PREOPTIC AREA BASICALLY RESIDE OVER THE ROOF YOUR MOUTH THESE ARE NURONS WITHIN THE HYPOTHALIMES AND NURONS IN THE PREOPTIC ARIA HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEND SIGNALS OUT TO THE REST OF YOUR BRAIN AND BODY TO GET YOU TO HEAT UP AND ACTUALLY TO CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR SO THAT YOU HEAT UP THAT'S RIGHT IF NURONS IN THE PREOPTIC AREA RECEIVE AN ELECTRICAL SIGNAL THROUGH THE CIRCUIT I JUST DESCRIBED THAT GOES FROM SKIN THE DORSALHORN OF THE SPONALCORD TO LATERAL PERUBRICIO THEY WILL START SENDING SIGNALS OUT TO THE ORGANS OF YOUR BODY AND THE TISSUES OF YOUR BODY TO GET THOSE ORGANS AND TISSUES TO DO THINGS AND BELIEVE OR NOT YOUR P OWAY YOUR PREOTIC ARY WILL ACTUALLY CHANGE THE WAY THAT YOU THINK AND FEEL IMMEDIATELY FOR INSTANCE IF SOMETHING WARM CONTACTS YOUR SKIN OR SOMETHING VERY HOT CONTACTS YOUR SKIN THE PREOPTIC AREA WILL SEND SIGNALS OUT TO THE ENDOTHELIAL CELLS THE BLOOD VESSELS BOTH OF THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT GET THEM TO DILATE I TO ESSENTIALLY INCREASE THEIR VOLUME AND THEIR SURFACE AREA IN ORDER TO CAST OFF HEAT YOU WILL ALSO START SWEATING THAT SWEATING RESPONSE IS INITIATED NOT BY THE HOT DAY OR THE HOT SUN BUT BY THE PREOPTIC AREA NURONS THAT SEND SIGNALS OUT TO WHAT'S CALL THE PERIFERY OF YOUR BODY AND OTHER CHEMICALS ARE RELEASED THINGS LIKE A SEETOL COLLING THAT GET YOU TO SWEAT AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE SHIVERING NURONS IN THE PREOPTIC AREA WILL MAKE SURE THAT YOU STOP SHIVERING YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THE FEELING OF BEING SOMEWHAT LETHARGIC OR SPREADING OUT YOUR LIMBS ON A HOT DAY WELL THAT IS THE RESULT OF NURONS IN YOUR PREOPTIC AREA IMPACTING YOUR MUSCULATURE TO GET YOU TO INCREASE YOUR SURFACE AREA SO YOU CAN SWEAT OFF OR RELEASE MORE HEAT SO THERE ALL THESE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS BY WHICH WE DUMP HEAT SOME OF THOSE ARE PURELY PHYSIOLOGICAL THE LOW ARE CONSCIOUS CONTROL THINGS LIKE SWEATING WHICH YOU CAN'T JUST MAKE YOURSELF SWEAT ON DEMAND MAYBE YOU CAN THROUGH A SET OF STRESSFUL THOUGHTS BUT YOU CAN JUST MAKE YOURSELF SWEAT THAT IS AUTONOMIC ITS BELOW YOUR CONSCIOUS CONTROL THINGS LIKE VEZODILATION THE DILATION OF YOUR VEINS IN PARTICULAR IN CAPOLARIES IN PARTICULAR THESE SORTS OF THINGS AND OF COURSE THERE ARE THESE BEHAVIAL SOMEWHAT VOLUNTARY ASPECTS OF DUMPING HEAT AND THE LETHARGY THE KIND OF TIREDNESS THAT WE FEEL ON A REALLY HOT DAY THAT'S ALSO CONTROLLED BY THIS CIRCUIT THAT I JUST DESCRIBE IN FACT I JUST GOT BACK FROM A VISIT TO A VERY WARM PLACE AND IT WAS REMARKABLE TO ME HOW LETHARGIC I FELT IN THE AFTERNOONS I JUST FELT LIKE A TOTAL SLUG I JUST COULD NOT MOVE OR RALLY TO DO ANYTHING EXCEPT IF I WAITED UNTIL THE EVENING EVEN THOUGH IT WAS LATER IN THE DAY EVEN THOUGH I HADN'T NAPPED AS THE TEMPERATURE IN MY ENVIRONMENT COOLED OFF AS MY BODY TEMPERATURE COOLED OFF I FELT LIKE HAD MORE ENERGY I WAS ACTUALLY WAKING UP EVEN THOUGH I HAD BEEN AWAKE FOR LONGER SO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TEMPERATURE AND LETHARGY IS A VERY INTIMATE ONE IF WE'RE WARM ENOUGH WE FEEL ACTIVE AND LIKE WE WANT A MOVE AROUND IF WE'RE TOO WARM WE FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO STAY PUT AND SPREAD OUT OUR LIMBS AND DUMP HEAT AND THAT BRINGS ME TO A QUICK AND CON OF FUN POINT ABOUT HOW WE DUMP HEAT VERSES HOW OTHER ANIMALS DUMP HEAT MANY OF YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT WE DUMP HEAT BY SWEATING OTHER MECHANISM'S AS WELL SOME OF WHICH I DESCRIBE BUT THAT'S OUR MAIN WAY OF DUMPING HEAT OTHER ANIMALS LIKE DOGS DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SWEAT AT LEAST NOT VERY MUCH SO THEY PANT RIGHT IN ORDER TO DUMP HEAT AND STILL OTHER ANIMALS LIKE RODINTS WHEN THEY GET TOO HOT THEY SPIT ON THEIR PAWS AND THEY RUB THAT SPIT ON THE SURFACE OF THEIR BODY WHICH MIGHT SOUND CONTAGROSS AND PROBABLY WILL GET YOU TO THINK TWICE BEFORE PETTING ANY F THOSE ANIMALS OR HOLDING ANY OF THOSE ANIMALS AGAIN UNLESS THAT'S YOUR THING NOW ONE OTHER KEYTHING TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS CIRCUIT RELATED TO HEAT IS THAT THE PREOPTIC AREA ALSO CAN SEND ELECTRICAL SIGNALS TO THE EMIGDOLA A BRAIN AREA THAT IS OFTEN TALKED ABOUT IN THE CONTEXT OF FEAR BUT IS REALLY JUST A BRAIN AREA THAT CAN ACTIVATE YOUR SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS PART OF YOUR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND IS THE ONE ASSOCIATED WITH FIGHT OR FLIGHT OR WITH THE STRESS RESPONS OR EVEN JUST THE EXCITED RESPONSE RIGHT THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS ALSO WHAT GETS ACTIVATED WHEN YOU'R REALLY EXCITED ABOUT SOMETHING THE PREOPTIC AREA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRIGER THE ACTIVATION OF THE IMIGDOLA NOW T DOESN'T DO IT EVERY TIME BUT IT CAN AND IT TENDS TO DO THAT WHEN YOU ARE SUDDENLY IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT FEELS TOO HOT THAT YOU FEEL IS RISKY LEVELS OF HOT IF YOU EVER HAVE GOT AN INTO A SAUNA THAT WAS VERY VERY HOT MAYBE TWO HUNDRED TEN DEGREES FARENHEIHT YOU SIT THERE FOR A MINUTE YOU'LL NOTICE THAT YOUR HEART RATE INCREASES AND THEIR REASONS FOR THAT AND WILL TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF THAT IN A FEW MINUTES BUT IT'S PRETTY UNCOMFORTABLE YOU MAY NOT FEEL LIKE YOUR SKIN IS GOING O BURN UP BUT YOU OFTEN WILL FEEL THE IMPULSE TO GET OUT ESPECIAL IF YOU STAY IN THERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE THAT IMPULSE IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS PREOPTIC AREA COMMUNICATING WITH YOUR AMIGDOLA SAINT HEY THIS ENVIRONMENT IS REALLY HOT AND I'M TRYING TO COOL DOWN AND IT'S NOT REALLY WORKING I'M DUMPING HEAT BUT I'M NOT ABLE TO ADJUST THE CORE OF MY BODY TEMPERATURE AND WAYS THAT ARE GOING TO PROTECT MY NURRONS AND SO IT'S A SIGNAL THAT YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T STAY IN THAT ENVIRONMENT TOO LONG NOW LATER WILL TALK ABOUT THE ADVANTAGE OF PUSHING YOURSELF A LITTLE BIT THROUGH SOME OF THESE VERY HOT ENVIRONMENTS PROVIDED YOU CAN DO IT SAFELY BUT THE IMPULSE TO GET YOURSELF OUT OF A VERY HOT ENVIRONMENT IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE PIOA COMMUNICATING WITH YOUR AMIGDOLA AND THE IMIGDOLA THEN IN TURN ACTIVATING YOUR A DRENAL GLANDS WHICH ARE SITRIGHT ABOVE YOUR KIDNEYS THE RELEASE OF A DRENALIN AND THIS FEELING OF AGITATION LIKE YOU WANT TO MOVE YUSUALLY YOU WANT TO MOVE OUT OF WHATEVER HOT ENVIRONMENT YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN SO NOW YOU KNOW THE CIRCUIT AGAIN IT'S SIMPLYT GOES FROM SKIN TO SPINAL CORD ONE BRAIN AREA TO ANOTHER BRAIN AREA THAT'S THE KEY ONE IN THIS DISCUSSION WHICH IS THE P OAY THE PREOPTIC AREA IN THE PR Y OPTICARIA CAN KICK OFF A BUNCH OF AUTONOMIC SUBCONSCIOUS RESPONSEES TO HEAT WHICH MAKE US ATTEMPT TO GET COOLER THINGS LIKE SWEATING VASODILATION ET CETERA AND IT CAN KICK OFF BEHAVIORL RESPONSES SPREADING OUT OUR LIMBS IN A N ATTEMPT TO DUMP EVEN MORE HEAT FEELING LETHARGIC SO A LACK OF DESIRE TO RUN AND MOVE AND IT ALSO HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO KICK OFF A MILD OR MAY BE NOT SO MILE PANIC RESPONSE TO GET US OUT OF THAT HOT ENVIRONMENT IF YOU CAN CONCEPTIOALIZE THAT CIRCUIT OR IF YOU CAN EVEN JUST UNDERSTAND WHAT I JUST SAID EVEN AT A TOP CONTOR LEVEL YOU ARE GOING TO BE IN A GREAT POSITION TO UNDERSTAND THE REST OF THE INFORMATION AND THE TOOLS THAT FOLLOW NEXT ID LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE USE OF DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE INCLUDING SANA BUT OTHER TOOLS AS WELL AS A WAY TO UNDERSTAND HOW HEAT AND HEATING CHANGES OUR BIOLOGY YOU ARE GOING TO LEARN O MECHANISM AND YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN SOME TOOLS BUT FIRST ID LIKE TO JUST EMPHASIZE THAT THE USE OF DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE CAN BE A VERY POWERFUL WAY TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND LONGEVITY THERE'S A WONDERFUL STUDY ON THIS THAT WAS PUBLISH IN TWO THOUSIN EIGHTEEN THAT INCLUDES A LOT OF DATA FROM A LOT OF PARTICIPANTS IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT CONDITIONS FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE THAT ONLY DID SANA ONCE VIRSES TO TO THREE TIMES A WEEK FRSES FOR TO SEVEN TIMES A WEEK AND SO ON AND COMPARES ALL THOSE THE TITLE OF THE STUDY IS SANA BATHING IS AS SOCIATED WITH REDUCED CARTIOVASCULAR MORTALITY AND IMPROVES RISK PREDICTION IN MEN AND WOMEN A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY THIS IS ONE OF SEVERAL PAPERS THAT CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE THAT REGULAR USE OF SANA OR OTHER FORMS OF DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE CAN REDUSE MORTALITY TO CARTY OF ASCULAR EVENTS BUT ALSO TO OTHER EVENTS THINGS LIKE STROKE AND OTHER THINGS THAT BASICALLY CAN KILL US WHAT I LIKE SO MUCH ABOUT THIS AND THE RELATED STUDIES AND YES I WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THESE IN THE SHO NOTES IS THAT THEY INVOLVE A LOT OF PARTICIPANT SO FOR INSTANCE IN THIS PARTICULAR PAPER WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN BEM SEE MEDICINE THEY LOOKED AT A SAMPLE OF ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT PARTICIPANTS WHO HAD A MEAN AGE OF SIXTY THREE BUT THERE WAS A RANGE OF AGES AROUND SIXTY THREE AND OF WHOM FIFTY ONE POINT FOR PERCENT WERE WOMEN THE REST WERE MEN SO IT'S A PRETTY NICELY VARIED STUDY IN TERMS OF THE POPULATIONS THAT THEY LOOKED AT AND BASICALLY WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THE MORE OFTEN THAT PEOPLE DO SANA THE BETTER THEIR HEALTH IS AND THE LOWER THE LIKELIHOOD THEY WILL DIE FROM SOME SORT OF PARTY OF ASCULAR EVENT NOW WHAT DO WE MEAN BY SANA WE NEED TO DEFINE SOME OF THE PARAMETERS AROUND SANA AND I PROMISE TO PROVIDE YOU SOME ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO ACCESS SOME OF THE HEALTH BENEFITS THAT WE'RE OBSERVED IN THIS AND RELATED STUDIES WITHOUT THE NEED TO HAVE A SANAC AS IE DO REALIZE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO SANA FIRST OFF THE TEMPERATURE RANGES THAT WERE USED IN THIS STUDY AND PRETTY MUCH ALL THE STUDIES THAT I 'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT UNLESS I SAY OTHERWISE ARE BETWEEN EIGHTY DEGREES SELCY IS MEANING A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX DEGREES FARRENHEIT AND A HUNDRED DEGREES SELSIEST MEANING TWO HUNDRED AND TWELVE DEGREES FARRENHEIT SO SOMEWHERE IN THAT RANGE HOW HOT SHOULD YOU MAKE THE SANA OR THE ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU GET INTO SHOULD YOU DECIDE TO USE THESE TOOLS WELL THAT WILL DEPEND ON YOUR TOLERANCE FOR HEAT HOW HEAT ADAPTED YOU ARE YES SOME PEOPLE ARE BETTER AT SWEATING THAN OTHERS AND OVER TIME WE ALL GET BETTER AT SWEATING MEANING IF YOU GOINTO THE SONA MORE FREQUENTLY YOU BECOME A BETTER SWEAT TUR NOT SWHAT ARE YOU WERE BUT THE VERB SWEATER YOU GET BETTER AT SWEATING AT DUMPING HEAT THROUGH THE LOSS OF WATER SO IT'S GOING TO DEPEND I RECOMMEND STARTING ON THE LOWER END OF THE TEMPERATURE SCALE AND IF THAT'S TOO HOT FOR YOU THAT YOU EVEN LOWER THE TEMPERATURE FURTHER NOW HOW LONG WERE PEOPLE EXPOSING THEMSELVES TO THESE HOT ENVIRONMENTS ANYWHERE FROM FIVE TO TWENTY MINUTES PER SESSION AND AS YOU'LL SOON LEARN VERY BRIEF PERIODS OF JUST FIVE MINUTES OF HEAT EXPOSURE CAN BE A POWERFUL STIMULUS IF THE HEAT EXPOSURE IS SIGNIFICANTLY GREAT ENOUGH FOR YOU OK TWENTY MINUTES CAN ALSO BE BENEFICIAL BUT EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED DEGREES SELSIEST MEANING HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX DEGREES FARENHEIT TO TWO HUNDREDAN TWELVE DEGREES ARENIT IS THE GENERAL RANGED AT THIS AND MOST STUDIES USE IN THIS PARTICULAR STUDY THEY COMPARED THE EFFECTS OF PEOPLE THAT DID SANA ONCE A WEEK TWO OR THREE TIMES PER WEEK OR FOUR TO SEVEN TIMES PER WEEK AND WHAT THEY SAW WAS REALLY REMARKABLE WHAT THEY OBSERVED WAS THAT PEOPLE WHO WENT INTO THE SONA TWO OR THREE TIMES PER WEEK WERE TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT LESS LIKELY TO DIE OF A CARTY O VASCULAR EVENT THAN PEOPLE THAT WENT INTO THE SONA JUST ONCE A WEEK AGAIN AT THE TEMPERATURE LEVELS AND THE DURATION THAT I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE DURATION THAN TEMPERATURE LEVELS WERE RELATED SO IF PEOPLE WENT INTO VERY HOT ENVIRONMENTS AT W REALLY UN COMFORTABLE FOR THEM MAYBE THEY ONLY WENT IN FOR FIVE MINUTES WHEREAS IF THEY WERE MORE COMFORTABLE AND HEAT ADAPTED IN HA GIVEN ENVIRONMENT OF THEIR TOLERANCE FOR HEAT WAS JUST SIMPLY HIGHER FOR WHATEVER REASON WELL THEN THEY TENDED TO STAY AN LONGER WE CAN TAKE A SORT OF AVERAGE OF THIS FIVE TO TWENTY MINUTE RANGE AND TO DAY WERE MAINLY GOING TO TALK ABOUT EXPOSURES BETWEEN TEN AND TWENTY MINUTES AT TEMPERATURES BETWEEN AGAIN EIGHT DEGREES AND A HUNDREGREE SELSIES HUNDRED SEVENY SIX DEGREES FARENHEI OR TWO HUNDRED TWE DEGREES FARRNHEIT SO THESE DAYTA POINT TO THE FACT THAT GOING IN THE SONA TWO OR THREE TIMES PER WEEK IS REALLY BENEFICIAL AND CAN LOWER MORTALITY TO CARTEVASCULAR EVENTS AND IN FACT THE BENEFITS WERE EVEN GREATER FOR PEOPLE THAT WERE GOING INTO THE SONA FOUR TO SEVEN TIMES PER WEEK THOSE PEOPLE WERE FIFTY PER CENT LESS LIKELY TO DIE OF A CARTY OVASCULAR EVENT COMPARED TO PEOPLE THAT WENT INTO THE SONA JUST ONCE A WEEK SO THESE ARE REALLY IMPRESSIVE AND FRANKLY ENCOURAGING STUDIES CERTAINLY THEY CAUGHT MY EYE AND ENCOURAGED ME TO START USING DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE ON A REGULAR BASIS WHAT'S PARTICULARLY NICE ABOUT THIS STUDY AND THE RELATED STUDY THAT AGAIN AS LINKED IN THE SHOWNOTES IS THAT THEY LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF OTENTIALLY CONFOUNDING VARIABLES THINGS LIKE WHETHER NOT PEOPLE SMOKES THINGS LIKE WHETHER NOT PEOPLE WERE OVER WEIGHT WHETHER OR NOT THEY TENDED TO EXERCISE OR NOT EXERCISE AND THEY WERE ABLE TO SEPARATE OUT THOSE VARIABLES SO THE PERCENTAGES THAT HAD DESCRIBED EARLY OR TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT LESS LIKELY TO DIE OF A CARDE OVASCULAR EVENT FOR THOSE THAT WENT NE SANA TWO TO THREE TIMES A WEEK AND FIFTY PER CENT LESS LIKELY DIE OF A CARDVASCULAR VENT FOR THOSE THAT WENT INT THE SANA FOUR TIMES PRER WEEK AS COMPARED TO JUST ONCE A WEEK THOSE EFFECTS REALLY DO SEEM TO BE THE CONSEQUENTS OF THE SANA EXPOSURE AND NOT SOME OTHER EFFECT THAT'S CORRELATED WITH SANA EXPOSURE LIKE GOING TO THE GIM WHERE PEOPLE ARE WORKING OUT SEVEN TIMES A WEEK ANDTHAN ALSO HAPPEN AGET INTO THE SANA OR QUITTING SMOKING RIGHT ABOUT THE SAME TIME THEY ADOPT A A SANA PROTOCAL THESE SORTS OF THINGS AND NOW THERE HAVE BEEN ADDITIONAL ANALYSIES OF THE USE OF SANA FOR IMPROVING HEALTH WHERE I SHOULD SAY FOR OFFSETTING MORTALITY THAT HAVE FOUND THAT IT'S NOTJIOUS REDUCTIONS AND CARD OFVASCULAR EVENTS BUT SO CALLED ALL CAUSE MORTALITY THIS IS KIND OF MEDICAL GEEKS SPEAK FOR SAYING HOW LIKELY ARE YOU OR SOMEBODY TO DIE FROM A CARDE OVASCULAR EVENT BUT MAY BE ALSO FROM SOME OTHER EVENT SOME OTHER HEALTH RELATEENT LIKE CANCOR OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT AND IN EVERY CASE REGULAR EXPOSURE TO SANA STARTING IT ABOUT TWO OR THREE TIMES PER WEEK ALL THE WAY UP TO SEVEN TIMES PER WEEK GREATLY IMPROVES MEANING STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN LONGEVITY IN THE SENSE THAT THEY PEOPLE ARE LESS LIKELY TO DIE OF CARDYOVASCULAR EVENTS AND OTHER THINGS THAT KILL US SO I AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED NOT JUST IN OUR OWN HEALTH BUT IN EDUCATING ABOUT HEALTH RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC FIND THIS REALLY EXCITING BUT KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HOW HEAT IMPACTS AR BIOLOGY IT PROBABLY SHOULDN'T SURPRISE US THAT THIS SANA TYPE EXPOSURE OR DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE HAS THESE INCREDIBLE EFFECTS SO BEFORE WE GET INTO THE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF HOW HEAT CAN HAVE ALL THESE IMPRESSIVE HEALTH EFFECTS I WANT TO JUST TALK ABOUT THE USE OF SANA AS A TOOL AND EMPHASIZE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE A SANA IN ORDER TO GET THESE BENEFITS IT IS SIMPLY A MATTER OF MAKING SURE THAT YOUR SHELL AND YOUR CORPE HEAT UP PROPERLY A BIT NOT TOO MUCH NOT TOO LITTLE BUTHEY HEAT TOES UP AND KNOW YOU DO NOT NEED TO CARRY A THERMOMETER ROUND OR PLACE A THERMOMETER INTO YOUR CORPES YOU KNOWIN LABORATORY STUDIES AND IN HUMANS IF YOU REALLY WANTED NOW SOONESCORT TEMPERATURE BASILY TRY TO PUT THE THERMO PROBE AS CLOSE TO THE CORP AS YOU CAN SO TYPICALLY THAT'S DONE RECTILY OR O AMOUTH THERMOMETER OR EVEN UP THE NOSE YOU DON'T NEED TO DO ANY THAT O RIGHT THIS IS AN ELABORATORY STUDY THERE'S IT THERE ARE WAYS TO CREATE A HOT ENVIRONMENT SUCH THAT YOU HEAT UP YOUR SHELL IN YOUR CORPE SAFELY WITHOUT HAVING TO MEASURE YOUR CORT TEMPERATURE ALL ALONG IF YOU WANT DO THAT BE MY GUEST BUT I'M NOT CAN PROVIDE A PROTOCAL SO THE QUESTION IS HOW ARE YOU HEATING UP YOUR ENVIRONMENT A ND I REALIZE THAT THERE ARE DRYSONAS THERE ARE STEAMSONAS THERE ARE IMFERDSONAS THERE ARE HOT TUBS AND THERE ARE SIMPLY ROOMS THAT YOU CRANK UP THE HEAT OKE THERE ARE ALSO WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN INCREASE YOUR SHELL IN YOUR CORT TEMPERATURE BY MOVING AROUND A LOT AND DOING THAT WEARING A LOT OF CLOTHING THERE'S NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT ANY ONE OF THESE APPROACHES OR PROTOCOLS IT'S JUST SO HAPPENS THAT SANA IS ONE OF THE MORE CONVENIENT WAYS TO DO THIS AND CERTAINLY FOR THE STUDIES THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT NOT JUST THE ONES I REFERENCE BEFORE BUT ALL THE STUDIES THAT I RESEARCH LOOK IN THIS EPISODE IT MAKE SENSE WHY THEY WOULD USANA BECAUSE IT'S VERY HARD FOR INSTANCE TO CREATE CONDITIONS WEAR YOU HAVE YOU FIVE PEOPLE GO OUT JOGGING WEARING HEAVY SWEATERS AND HATS WOLL HATS ON THE MIDDLE OF SOMMER IT'S VERY HARD TO SET UP THOSE CONDITIONS IN A WAY THAT'S CONTROLLED FOR EVERYBODY WHEREAS IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO HAVE A SANA WHERE YOU HAVE ONE OR SEVERAL PEOPLE JUST GET INTO THAT ONE UNIFORMLY HOT ENVIRONMENE THAT'S A MUCH EASIER STUDY TO RUN SO JUST TO BE CLEAR THE TEMPERATURE RANGE IS IMPORTANT YOU WANT TO GET BETWEEN EIGHTY AND A HUNDRED DEGREE SELLSIUS NOW YOU KNOW THE CONVERSION TO FERENHEIHT YOU COUT HOWEVER IMERSE YOURSELF IN A HOT TUB OR HOT WATER BATH UP TO YOUR NECK THAT'S ANOTHER WAY TO APPROACH IT IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO EITHER OF THOSE YOU COULD ALSO PUT ON AS A HOODY OR A WOOLL HAT AND AHOODY OR YOU COULD DO LIKE THE WRESTLERS DO AND YOU COULDASHY BUY ONE OF THESE A PLASTIC SUITS THER LILY CALL PLASTICS THAT A WRESTLERS ORE OTHER ATHLETES THAT WISH TO DROP WATER WEIGHT WILL WEAR AND THEN GO JOGGING THAT ALL OF THOSE WILL INCREASE YOUR SHELL IN YOUR CORBODI TEMPERATURE I SPECIALLY YOU DO IT ON A HOT DAY BUT O COURSE BE CAREFUL HYDRATE AND DON'T OVER HE DON'T BECOME EXCESSIVELY HYPROTHERMIC AUSE YOU CAN GET HEAT STROKE AND YOU CAN POTENTIALLY DIE BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE SANA OFTEN I GET THE QUESTION HOW HOT SHOF THE SONABY WILL NOW YOU KNOW HOW LONG SHOULD YOU BE IN THEIR FIVE TO TWENTY MINUTES PUR SESSION ALTHOUGH I WILL TALK IN A MINUTE ABOUT WASTE OPTIMAS HORMON OU PUT ING PARTICULAR GROTHORMORN OUT PUT BY DOING FOUR VERY BRIEF SESSIONS SO MAYBE NOT A CONTINUO A SESSION WILL GET INTO THAT A FEW MINUTES AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WETSONA DRISONA YOU KNOWIT DOESN'T MATTER USE WHAT YOU PREFER MANY PEOPLE ASK ME WHAT ABOUT IMFERREDSONA WE HAVE AN ENTIRE EPISODE ALL ABOUT THE USE OF LIGHT AND LOW LEVEL LIGHT THERAPY INCLUDING IMPERED LIGHT IT DOES HAVE CERTAIN BENEFITS FOR SKIN AND OTHER ORGANS AND TISSUES OF THE BODY IF USED PROPERLY MY UNDERSTANDING R AT LEAST MY ASSESSMENT OF MOST INFERRED SONAS OUT THERE IS THAT THEY DON'T GET HOT ENOUGH THEY DON'T GET UP TO THAT EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED DEGREES SELSIEST RANGE SOME DO MOST DON'T SO WHAT YOU END UP WITH IS A SITUATION WHERE YOU'VE GOT A RED LIGHT LOW LEVEL LIGHT THERAPY STIMULUS AND YOU'VE GOT A SANA THAT'S NOT QUITE HOT ENOUGH AND THERE'RE A LOT OF IDEAS AND CLAIMS ABOUT HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER IN ORDER TO GET YOU IMPROVED BENEFITS I PERSONALLY AMOF THE STANCE BASED ON THE LITERATURE THAT I'VE READ THAT YOU WANT TO GET INTO THOSE RANGES OF A EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED DEGREES SELCIUS BEFORE YOU START CONSIDERING WHETHER NOT YOUR ALSO GOIN INCLUDE RED LIKE THERAPIES ET CETERA SO THERE'S NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT RED LIGHT SANA IT'S REALLY THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SANA THATYOU HAPPEN TO GET INTO SO WHICH TOOL WHICH SANA WHICH STIMULUS DERUNNING WEARING PLASTICS IN A HOODIAND WILL HAT YOU GET IN TO A SONAT NESCAAN DEPEND A LOT ON YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES YOUR BAGE IN WHAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO ON A REGULAR BASIS THIS IS A LOT LIKE OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT THE USE OF COLD MOST OF THE STUDIES HAVE LOOKED AT IMMERSION IN COLD WATER UP TO THE NECK BECAUSE THAT' T E VERY CONTROLLED SITUATION THAT CAN DO IN AN ELABORATORY THEY HAVE NOT EXPLORED COLD SHOWERS AS MUCH SOTHERS JIST LAST DATA OR WALKING AROUND IN A COLD ENVIRONMENT BUT WE'LL TALK ALOBIT ABOUT THOSE DATA A BECAUSE AS YOU'LL SOON LEARN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT COLD YOUR ACSHE TALCUMENT HEA TING AS WELL SO WHAT KIND OF MECHANISMS ARE ACTIVATED IN YOUR BRAIN ENVODY THAT ALLOW FOR THE VARIOUS HEALTH BENEFITS OF SANA OR OTHER FORMS OF DELIBERATE HEATING WELL WE TALKED ABOUT REDUCE RISK OF CARTIOVASCULAR EVENT RELATED MORTALITY IN ALL CAUSEMORTALITY AS YOU'LL SOON LEARN THERE ARE ALSO TREMENDOUS BENEFITS IN TERMS OF INCREASES IN GROWTH HORMON REDUCTIONS IN CORDAS ALL ET CETERA I WILL DETAIL THOSE SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET INTO A HOT ENVIRONMENT WHAT ARE THE MECHANISMS THAT ALLOW FOR THE VARIOUS HEALTH EFFECTS OF THAT WELL YOUR SHELL YOUR SKIN SENSE IS THAT AND THROUGH THE CIRCUIT THAT DIDESCRIBED EARLIER ACTIVATES NERONS IN THE PEOE THE PREOPTICARIA WHICH IN TURN ACTIVATES MECHANISMS IN YOUR AUTONOMIC NERVOUR SYSTEM LIKE VASO DILATION SO BLOOD FLOW INCREASES PLASMA VOLUME OF YOUR BLOOD INCREASES AND STROKE VOLUME THE VOLUME OF BLOOD THAT IS MOBILIZED WITH EACH BEAT OF YOUR HEART ALSO INCREASES AND YOUR HEARTRATE INCREASES TO ANYWHERE BETWEEN A HUNDRED TO A HUNDRED ND FIFTY BEATS PERMITTE THAT GENERAL CONSTELLATION OF EFFECTS LOOKS A LOT LIKE CARTIOVASCULAR EXERCISE AND IN FACT FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES IT REALLY IS CARTY OFVASCULAR EXERCISE EXCEPT THAT THERE ISN'T THE MOBILIZATION AND THE LOADING OF JOINTS AND LIMBS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT AND OF COURSE THERE ARE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF CARTIOVASCULAR EXERCISE THAT RELATE TO IN PACT ON THE GROUND IMPROVEMENTS AND BONE DENSITY ET CETER ET CETERA BUT BASIY YOUR HEART STARTS BEATING MORE BLOOD START CIRCULATING YOUR VASCULATURE CHANGE YOUS SHAPE LITERALLY TO ACCOMMODATE THOSE INCREASES IN HEARTRATE AND BLOOD VOLUME AND YOUR BUSY GETTING A CARTY OFVASCULAR WORKOUT IN THAT HOT ENVIRONMENT EVEN IF YOUR JUST SITTING DOWN ANOTHER SET OF POSITIVE EFFECTS RELATED TO BEING IN THESE HOT ENVIRONMENTS ARE HORMON EFFECTS SHIFTS IN THE OUTPUT OF HORMONS BOTH FROM YOUR DRENALS AND POSSIBLY FROM THE TESTIS AN OVERIES AND EVEN WITHIN THE BRAIN ONE OF THE MORE STRIKING EXAMPLES OF THAT COMES FROM A STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE TITLE OF THE STUDY IS INDICRANT EFFECTS OF REPEATED HOT THERMAL STRESS AND COLD WATER IMMERSION IN YOUNG ADULT MEN AND INDEED THE STUDY WAS IN THIS CASE JUST DONE ON MEN I'LL JUST BRIEFLY DESCRIBED THE PROTOCOL THEY USE THEY HAD THESE MEN ATTEN FOOUR SANASSESSIONS OF TWELVE MINUTES EACH SO AGAIN WELL WITHIN THAT RANGE OF FIVE TO TWENTYMENTES TWELVE MINUTES THE TEMPERATURE OF THOSANAS WAS NINETY TO NINETY ONE DEGREE CELSIUS SO ON DIS QUICKLY DO THE CALCULATION ADMITTEDLY NOT IN MY HEAD THAT'S A HUNDRED D NINETY FOUR DEGREES FARRENHEIT AND THEY DID THAT FOUR TIMES AFTERWARDS THEY HAD A SIX MINUTE COOL DOWN BREAK DURING WHICH THEY DID GET INTO SOME COOL WATER OR COLD WATER OF ABOUT TEN DEGREES WHICH IS TEN DEGREE SELSIUS IS FIFTY DEGREES FARRENHEIGHT AND THEN THEY MEASURED HORMONES AT VARIOUS TIMES THROUGHOUT THIS STUDY BEFORE DURING AN AFTER THEY LOOKED AT TESTASTRONE THEY LOOKED AT D H E A WHICH IS IN THE ANDROGEN PATHWAY THEY LOOKED AT PROLACTIN AND THEY LOOKED AT CORTISALL THE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF THE PROTOCOL THAT I JUST DESCRIBED WERE ON CORTIALL A SO CALLED STRESS HORMONE SO CALLED BECAUSE WHEN WE ARE VERY STRESS FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME CARTESAL LEVELS TEN TO INCREASE DRAMATICALLY BUT I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT A INCREASE IN CORTESALL EACH DAY WRITE ABOUT THE TIME OF WAKING AND SPECIFICALLY RIGHE ABOUT THE TIME OF WAKING IS ACTUALLY BENEFICIAL FOR OUR ALERTNESS IND OUR ENERGIE SO HAVING SOME INCREASIN CUARTESAL EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS IS A GOOD THING PROVIDED HAPPENS EARLY IN THE DAY LATE DAY INCREASES IN QARTESALL ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DEPRESSION THAT'S BEEN SHOWN BY STUDIES AT STAMFORD AND ELSEWHERE THE MAJOR EFFECT OF THE STUDY IS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CORTEISALL OUTPUT IN THESE SUBJECTS I THINK THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE SUFFER FROM ACUTE MEANING IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM STRESS AND ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO CONTROL THEIR STRESS CONTROLLING YOUR CORTISALL IS TRICKY IN THE EPISODE ON STRESS I TALKED ABOUT SUPPLEMENT SUCH AS ASHWAGANDA THAT CAN BE USED TO LIMIT CORTISALL BUT YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO USE ASHUAGANDA FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME MEANING FOR LONGER THAN TWO WEEKS BECASE YOU CAN GET INTO OTHER ISSUES I TALK ABOUT BREATH WORK PRORTOCOLS THAT CAN ALLOW YOU TO CLAMP OR REDUCE THE STRESS RESPONSE IN REAL TIME AGAIN SEE THAT EPISODE FOR THOSE BUT MANY PEOPLE ARE OVER WORKED THEIR OVER STRESS THEIR FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER THERE SUBJECTED TO MANY TOO MANY STRESS ORS OR THEIR LEVEL OF STRESS RAZILIANS IS IN HIGH ENOUGH TO KEEP THEIR CARTESAL LEVELS CLAMPED AT A HEALTHY LEVEL SO THE PROTOCO DESCRIBED OF TWELVE MINUTE EXPOSURES TO NINETY DEGREE ENVIRONMENT THAT'S AGAIN NINE DEGREES SELSIUS FOLLOWED BY A SIX MINUTE COOL DOWN BREAK IN COOL WATER O FIFTY DEGREES OR SO THAT'S PRETTY COLD I CAN IMAGINE THAT YOU COULD ALSO JUST TAKE A COOL SHOWER OR COLD SHOWER AFTERWARDS THAT HAD A VERY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON LOWERING CUARTES ALSO THERE YOU HAVE UT TOOL IT'S NOT A COMPLETELY E ZEROCOSTOL CAUE YUMIN TO HEAT THE WATER YOU NEED HAVE ACCESS TO HOT AND COLD WATER AT LEAST HOT AND COLD CONTRAST OF SOME SORT BUT IT'S FAIRLY MINIMAL COST AND FOR MOST PEOPLE ESPECIALLIF YOU START GETTING CREATIVE ABOUT MAY BE TAKING A TWELVE MINUTE JOG WEARING A LOT OF CLOTHING IF IT'S HOT OUT THEN GETTING INTO A COOL SHOWER YOU MIGHT NOT GET THE SAME EXTREME OR SIGNIFICANT RODUCTION IN QUARTISAL THAT WAS OBSERVED HERE WITH THESE VERY SPECIFIC PROTOCOLS BUT IT'S LIKELY THAT YOU WOULD GET A SIMILAR RESULT OVER ALL NOW I MENTION THEY DID LOOK AT THESE OTHER HORMONES AND I'LL JUST TELL YOU THAT THEY DID NOT SEE SIGNIFICANT SHIFTS IN TESTOSTRON PROLACTEN D'TIER ET CETERA USING THIS PROTOCOL AS YOU SOON SEE THEIR OTHER SONA PROTOCOLS THAT CAN IMPACT THOSE OTHER HORMONES SO IF YOUR SEEKING TO USE SANA TO REDUCE STRESS I THINK THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING AND PROTENTIALLY USEFUL RESEARCH BACT PROTOCOL AND AGAIN WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THE PAPER I YOU'D LIKE TO READ MORE ABOUT THE DATA SO THAT IS ONE SET OF BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS ON QUARTIS AL AND THE RELATED PROTOCOL HAT ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER BENEFITS OF SANA WELL WE'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE BUT I WONE TO TALK ABOUT THOSE IN THE CONTACTS OF THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS BECAUSE IF YOU UNDERSTUND IN THOSE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS YOU CAN REALLY TAILOR YOUR SONA PROTOCOLS FOR YOUR PARTICULAR NEEDS ONE OF THE MORE DRAMMATIC AND IMPORTANT EFFECTS OF GOING INTO A HOT ENVIRONMENT FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME IS THE ACTIVATION OF SO CALLED HEAT SHOCK PROTINESE OR EACH S PEES HEAT SHOCK PROTINES ARE A PROTECTIVE MECHANISM INYOUR BRAIN AN BODY TO RESCUE PROTINES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE MISFOLD I MEAN BY THIS WELL MOST OF YOUR FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT YE AVE PROTINE IN THE KITCHEN A A STAKE OR A PIECE OF CHICKEN OR A PIECE OF FISH AND YOU HEATED OP IT CHANGES ITS TEXTURE I WRAWMEAT IS DIFFERENT THAN COOKED MEE TO BE QUITE BLUNT ABOUT IT HEAT CHANGES THE QUALITY OF ROTINES NOTJUS IN TERMS HOW THEY TASTE BUT THE WAY IN WHICH THEY ARE CONFIGURED CHANGE TH RIGHT DOWN THE MOLECULAR LEVEL WHEN YOUR BODY GOES THROUGH CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE EACH DAY AND WI'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE CHANGES BUT IN RESPONSE TO HOT ENVIRONMENTS ARE COLD ENVIRONMENTS HEAT SHOCK PROTINES ARE DEPLOYED TO GO AND RESCUE AND PREVENT THE CHANGES IN PROTINES THAT WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO YOUR HEALTH SO AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM ACTIVATING HEAT SHOCK PROTINES IS A GOOD THING YOU DON'T WANT HEAT SHOCK PROTIS TO BE ACTIVATED FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME BECAUSE THAT GETS TO BE PROBLEMATIC FOR OTHER REASONS BUT THESE HEAT SHOCK PROTINES OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY VARIETIES BASILY HAVE THE JOB OF TRAVELING IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY AND MAKING SURE THAT SELLS THAT CONTAIN PROTINES THAT ARE MISFOLDING BECAUSE THEY GOT HEATED UP TOO MUCH DON'T MISFOLD AND THEY ALSO SERVOF A PROTECTIVE MECHANISM MAKING SURE THAT PROTINES WITHIN THE CELLS OF YOUR BRAIN ANBODY DON'T FOLD IN THE WRONG WAYS GAN I'M DESCRIBING THIS IN VERY GENERAL TERMS BUT IT'S WELL ESTABLISHED IN ANIMAL MODELS AND IN HUMANS THAT SANA EXPOSURE OF THE SORT THAT I DESCRIBED EARLIER ACTIVATES THESE HEAT SH OCK PROTINES THERE S SOME INTERESTING STUDIES THAT WERE CARRIED OUT IN ANIMAL MODELS THAT REALLY NICELY MECHANISTICALLY SUPPORT THE ROLE OF HEAT SHOCK PROTINES IN SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE SOME OF THESE STUDIES WERE DONE IN FLIES SOME F MEANING DRASOPHAL OF FRUIT FLIES CAUSE THEIR GREAT MODEL ORGANISM BECAUSE YOU CAN DELEAT GENES ARE AGENES EASILY OTHER SADIES HAVE BEN DONE IN MICE AND NOW THERE ALSO STUDIES BEING CARRIED OUT IN HUMANS AN I WILL TALK ABOUT THOSE ONE OF THE MORE DRAMATIC EXAMPLES THAT'S ALWAYS AND TOWTED IN THIS FIELD OF DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE AS THAT RELATES TO LONGEVITY IS THAT IF THEY EXEXPOSE THESE FLIES THESE FRUIT FLIES TO SEVENTY MINUTES OF A HEAT STIMULUS THAT WOUTD OBVOUSEEDINT KILL THEM BUT ACTIVATED HEATSHOCK PROTINES IT COULD EXTEND THEIR LIFE BY FIFTEEN PER CENT IN A HEAT SHOCK DEPENDENT WAY MEANING IF THEY MADE FLIES THAT DIN HAVE THESE HEAT SHOCK PROTINES WELL THEN THEY DIDN'T SEE THIS EXTENSION IN LIFE AND THIS IS ONE F THE REASON TO USE MODEL ORGANISMS IS NOT AN EXPERIMENT THAT YOU COULD DO IN PEOPLE HOWEVER THERE HAVE BEEN INTERESTING STUDIES DONE INHUMANS EXAMINING SOME OF THE DOWNSTREAME MOLECULAR PATHWAYS OF DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE THAT POINT TO THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH DELIERTE HEAT EXPOSURE CAN HELP PROTECT AGAINST DFFERENT FORMS OF MORTALITY IMPROVE HEALTH OVER ALL AND POSSIBLY NO WHEN A HIGHLIKE POSSIBLY POSSIBLY EXTEND LIFE ONE  SUCH MECHANISM INVOLVES A GENETIC PROGRAM INVOLVING A MOLECULE CALLED FOX O THREE FOXO THREE IS A VERY INTERESTING MOLECULE BECAUSE IT'S INVOLVED IN DIAN REPAIR PATHWAYS DIANA REPAIR IS PART OF THE PROCESS OF REMAINING HEALTHY YOU KNOW WE'D ALL LIKE TO THINK THAT WERE BORN AND BASED ON THE GENES WE HAVE WE ARE HEALTHY HEALTHY HEALTHY THAN EVENTUALLY WE AGE AND THEN WE DIE BUT FROM THE TIME WERE BORN UNTIL THE TIME WE DIE THERE'S A CONSTANT REPAIR OF OUR PROTINES IN OURSELVES IN A MODIFICATION OF THE GENES THAT ARE BEING EXPRESSED UNO PUBERTY BEING THE MOST DRAMATIC EXAMPLE RIGHT YOU SEE A KID BEFORE PUBERTY AND AFTER BEAUTY LOOKS LIKE A DIFFEREN KID SOUNDS LIKE DIFFEREN KID THINGS LIKE DIFFERENT KID IN FACT ASICALLY IS A DIFFERENT HUMAN BEING  IS NOT JUST THE HORMONSITS THAT HORMONES THEMSELVES HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TURN ON AND TURN OFF CERTAIN GENES LITERALLY CONVERTING CERTAIN TISSUES AND SELLS IN THE BRAIN EMBODY TO DO ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THINGS SO IS NOT JUST THE SPROUTING OF NEW ASPECTS OF OUR BIOLOGY IS LITERALY THE CONVERSION OF DIFFERENT BRAIN CENTERS FROM ONE FUNCTION TO ANOTHER THAT'S PUBERTY WHEN THE WHOLE EPISODE ABOUT PUBERTY WE ACTUALY DID AN EPISODE ON SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT THAT TALKS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THOSE MECHANISMS BUT THE POINT IS THAT THROUGHOUT OUR ENTIRE LIFE SPAND GENES ARE BEING TURNED ON GENES ARE BEING TURNED OFF GENES ARE BEING TURNED ON GENES ARE BEING TURNED OFF AND DIANA THE STUFF OF GENES GETS DAMAGED IN THAT PROCESS FOXO THREE SITS UPSTREAM IN A PATHWAY RELATED TO D'ANA REPAIR AND AGAIN CLEARING OF THESE SENICENT CELLS SONA EXPOSURE IN PARTICULAR SON EXPOSURE TWO TO THREE TIMES OR I DEALLY FOR TO SEVEN TIMES PER WEEK IN THAT EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED DEGREE SELCIES RANGE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO UPREGULATE LEVELS OF FOXO THREE FOXO THREE IN TURN UPREGULATES PATHWAYS RELATED TO DEANA REPAIR AND CLEARING OUT OF THESE SENICENT OR DEAD CELLS WHICH IS KNOWN TO BE IMPORTANT FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF MAINTAINING COGNITION AND OTHER ASPECTS OF MAINTAINING HEALTH SO THESE ARE THE LIKELY BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS FOR THE IMPROVEMENTS IN LIFESPAND OR I RATHER I SHOULD SAY THESE ARE THE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT APPARENTLY OFFSET SOME OF THE PARTY OF ASCULAR RISK AND OTHER FORMS OF MORTALITY THAT WERE DESCRIBED EARLIER ONE ESPECIALLY INTERESTING THING ABOUT FOXO THREE THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE THAT HAVE EITHER ADDITIONAL COPIES OF FOXO THREE OR WHO HAVE VERSIONS OF FOXO THREE THAT ARE HEYP OR ACTIVE SO TO SPEAK THOSE PEOPLE TEND TO BE TWO POINT SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO LIVE TO A HUNDRED YEARS OF AGE OR LONGER SO THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WERE JUST NATURALLY AND FORTUNATELY FOR THEM ENDOWED WITH MORE FOXO THREE MORE CLEARANCE OF SENISON CELLS MORE DIANA REPAIR ET CETERA FOR THE REST OF US AT LEAST OU NO TO MY KNOWLEDGE I DON'T HAVE A THE ONE OF THESE HEALTH PROMOTING FOXO THREE MUTATIONS REMEMBER MUTATIONS CAN BE BENEFICIALER THEY CAN BE DETRIMENTAL THIS IF YOURE GOAL IS TO LIVE LONGER IS A BENEFICIAL MUTATION WELL IF YOU DON'T HAVE THESE FOXO THREE MUTATIONS THAT ALLOW YOU TO BE A SENTINARIAN AT TWO POINT SEVEN TIMES A HIER LIKELIHOOD THAN OTHER PEOPLE DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE IS ONE WAY THAT YOU CAN INCREASE FOXO THREE ACTIVITY AT THIS POINT IN TIME MEANING WHEN LOOKING AT THE RESEARCH OUT THERE IT ISN'T CLEAR WHAT THE OPTIMAL SON O PROTOCAL IS GOING TO BE SPECIFICALLY TO INCREASE FOXO THREE AND THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ONE THERE IS NO SON OPROTOCALL DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO REDUCE CORTES ALL OR SPECIFICALLY TO INCREASE FOXO THREE OR SPECIFICALLY TO ACT OF EIGT HEATSHOCK PROTINES ANY DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE IS LIKELY TO IMPACT ALL OF THOSE MECHANISMS AGAIN I ENCOURAGE YOU TO USE THIS GUIDE OF EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED DEGREES SELCIUS AS YOUR KIND OF A BOOK ENDS FOR WHAT YOU CAN TOLERATE AND WHERE YOU WANT TO START AND EVENTUALLY TRANSITION TO IN TERMS OF DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO USE THAT FIVE TO TWENTY MINUTES PUAR SESSION FOR THE SANA AS YOUR ROUGH GUIDE OF HOW LONG TO REMAIN IN THE SANA NOW THERE WAS A STUDY PUBLISHES THIS LAST YEAR THAT WAS MAINLY FOCUSED ON DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE A DETAILED THIS I QUITE EXTENSIVELY IN THE EPISODE ON COLD THIS IS THE BEAUTIFUL WORK OF SUSANNA SOBERG AND THAT STUDY LOOKED AT DELIBERATE COL EXPOSURE BUT ALSO SANA EXPOSURE AND THAT STUDY FOUND THAT FIFTY SEVEN YES FIFTY SEVEN MINUTES PER WEEK OF SANA EXPOSURE INCONJUNCTION WITH ELEVEN MINUTES PER WEAK TOTAL OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE WAS THE THRESHOLD FORGETTING IMPROVEMENTS IN METABOLISM AND INCREASES IN BROWN FAT THIS VERY ACTIVE FAT TISSUE THAT IMPROVES MYT A CONDRIAL FUNCTION AND THERMOGENISIS MEAN HEATING OF THE BODY WILL TALK MORE ABOUT ROUND FAT LATER WHY DO I MENTION THIS WELL FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE INTERESTED IN INCREASING METABOLISM IT DOES SEEM TO BE MOST BENEFICIAL TO DO THAT ELEVEN MINUTES PER WEEK OF COLD EXPOSURE AGAIND DIVIDED UP ACROSS TWO OR MORE SESSIONS SO IT'S NOT ELEVEN MINUTES ALL AT ONCE BUT SHORTER SESSIONS AND TO GET FIFTY SEVEN MINUTES MINIMUM PER WEEK OF SON EXPOSURE AGAIN IN THE TEMPERATURE RANGES THAT IAVE TALKED ABOUT HERE AND AGAIN IT'S NOT FIFTY SEVEN MINUTES IN THE SONA ALL AT ONCE THAT'S FIFTY SEVEN MINUTES TOTAL PER WEEK AS THE MINMUM THRESHOLD SO YOU MIGHT DIVIDE THAT INTO THEREE SESSIONS OF TWENTY MINUTES AND AGAIN I DON'T THINK FIFTY SEVEN IS THE MAGIC NUMBER IT COULD BE SIXTY IT COULD BE SIXTY FOUR HITROULY COULD BE FIFTY FIVE REMEMBER YOUR BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS ARE NOT COUNTING THINGS OFF MIN UTE BY MINUTE SECOND BY SECOND LEAST NOT IN MOST CASES SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THERE INTERESTED IN IMPROVING METABOLISM CHECK OUT THE EPISODE ON COLD OR JUST TAKE THE SOBERG PROTOCALL AS I CALL IT WHICH IS ELEVEN MNUTES TOTAL PER WEEK OF UNCOMFORTABLY COLD BUT SAFE COLD EXPOSURE SO UN COMFORTABLY GOLD MEANS YOU REALLY REALLY WANT TO GET OUT OF THE SHOWER OF THE IMMEROF THE OR THE ICE BATH OR WHATEVER ENVIRONMENT B YOU CAN STAY IN ELEVEN MINUTES TOTAL PER WEEK DIVIDED ACROSS THE COUPLE SESSIONS AND THEN FIFTY SEVEN MINUTES PER WEEK OR SO OF DELIBERTE HEAT EXPOSURE AGAIN UNCOMFORTABLEAK BUT UNCOMFORTABLY HOTS CUVES ME BUT SAFE TO STAY IN PROBABLY DIVIDED UP ACROSS THREE OR MORE SESSIONS OKAS SAID WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE USE OF SANA TO DECREASE CORDISALL WE TALKEDABOUT THE USE OF SON INTO INCREASE HEAT CHALK PROTINES WEE TALKED ABOUT THE USE OF SONA TO INCREASE FAXO THREE NOW I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE USE OF SANA TO INCREASE GROWTH HORMON GROWTH HORMON IS A HORMON THAT WE ALL NATURALLY SECRETE FROM OUR PRETUITARY WHICH ALSO RESIDES NEAR THE ROOF OF OUR MOUTH THE SIGNAL FOR THE PETUITARY TO RELEASE GROWTH HORMON ARRIVES FROM NURONS THAT EXIST IN THE HYPOTHALEMUS SO GROWTH HORMON RELEASING HORMONS BELIEVE ARE NOT THAT'S WHAT HERECALLD STIMULATE THE RELEASE OF GROWTH HORMON FROM THE ANTERIOR TO PETUITARY GLAND INTO THE GENERAL CIRCULASION AND THEN GROWTH HORMON INPACTS METABOLISM AND GROWTH OF CELLS AND TISSUES OF THE BODY IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TISSUE REPAIR AS WELL AND THE GROSPER THAT EVERYONE EXPERIENCES DURING PUBRITY IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF GROWTH HORMON WHEN I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE IS A STUDY THAT FOUND DROMATIC REALLY DRAMATIC I SHOULD SAY INCREASES IN GROWTH HORMON BUT I ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THESE INCREASES IN GROWTH HORMON WERE NOT OF THE SORT THAT ARE OBSERVED IMPUBRITY OR IN INFANTS BECOMING ADOLESCENCE ARE ADOLESCENCE GROWING INTO TEEN AGERS THOSE LEVELS OF GROWTH HARMN THAT ARE ASSOCIATE WITH THOSE MASSIVE TRANSFORMATIONS SCUSE ME OF BODY MORE PHOLOGY OF SHAPE ARE FAR GREATER THAN THE SORTS THAT AM TALKING ABOUT HERE AND YET AS ALL OF US AGE WHEN WE GO FROM ADOLESCINTO ARTEEN AGE YEARS AND THEN INTO YOUNG ADULTHOOD BUT THEN STARTING IN OUR EARLY THIRTIES OR SO THE AMOUNT OF GROWTH HARMON THAT WE SECRETE IS GREATLY DIMINISHED NORMALLY WE WOULD RELEASE GROWTH HARMON EVERY NIGHT AFTER WE GO TO SLEEP IN PARTICULAR IN THE EARLY PART OF THE NIGHT WHEN OUR SLEEP IS COMPRISED MOSTLY OF SLOW WAVE SLEEP AS WE AGE LESS GROWTH HARMON IS RELEASED DURING THAT SLOW WAVE SLEEP THERE ARE VARIOUS THINGS THAT CAN PROMOTE THE RELEASE OF GROWTH HARMON AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE OTHER THINGS IN A MOMENT THINGS LIKE LOW BLOOD SUGAR TURNS OUT IS A STIMULUS FOR GROWTH HORMON RELEASE AND I DON'T MEAN HYBOGLYCEMIA OF THE SORT THAT MAKES YOU DIZZY IN WANT TO PASS OUT THAT'S BAD I MEAN NOT HAVING HIGH LEVELS OF GLUCOS AND INSOLENT IN YOUR BLOODSTREAM THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY MANY PEOPLE ARE DRAWN TO INTERMITTENT FASTING OR EVEN PROLONG FASTING BECAUSE OF THE REPORTED INCREASES IN GROWTH HARMON I'LL TOUCH ON THOSE BRIEFLY BUT IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THOSE IN WHAT THEIR REAL IMPACT IS AND THEXTENT OF GROWTH HARMON CHECK OUT THE EPISODE I DID ON FASTING YOU CAN FIND THAT AT HUBERMAN LAPED OUT CALM CERTAIN FORMS OF EXERCISE HAVE ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO STIMULATE GROWTH HARMON RELEASE AND IN A FEW MOMENTS I'LL TALK ABOUT HOW EXERCISE AND FASTING CAN BE COMBINED OR HOW HEAT CAN BE COMBINE WITH EXERCISE ARE CERTAIN PATTERNS OF FOOD IN TAKE TO FURTHER INCREASE GROWTH HORM BUT BEFORE I DO THAT I WANT TO REVIEW SOME OF THE DATA AND ONE STUDY IN PARTICULAR THAT DISCOVERED CERTAIN FORMS OF DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE USING SANA CAN STIMULATE VERY LARGE INCREASES IN GROWTH HARMON OUTPUT WHICH FOR PEOPLE IN THEIR THIRTIES FORTIES AND BEYOND COULD BE VERY USEFUL AND MAY ALSO BE USEFUL FOR PEOPLEWHO ARE JUST TRYING TO STIMULATE THE RELEASE OF MORE GROWTH HARMON IN ORDER TO FOR INSTANCE RECOVER FROM EXERCISE OR STIMULATE FAT LOSS OR MUSCLE GROWTH OR REPAIR OF OR PARTICULAR INJURY THE TITLE OF THIS PAPER IS INDICRANT EFFECTS OF REPEATED SANA BATHING AND THIS IS A PAPER THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WHICH IS SOME YEARS AGO BUT NONE THE LESS SERVES AS A BASIS FOR A LOT OF OTHER STUDIES THAT FOLLOWED SO LEMME DESCRIBED WHAT THEY DID IN THE STUDY THEY USED IN EIGHTY DEGREE CELSIES ENVIRONMENT SO THATS HA HUNDRE AND SEVENTY SIX TOGREES FAREN HEIGHT AND THEY HAD SUBJECTS DO THIS SNA FOR THIRTY MINUTES FOUR TIMES PER DAY SO THAT TWO HOURS TOTAL IN ONE DAY THIRTY MINUTES IN THE SANA A PERIED OF COOL DOWN REST THIRTY MINCE INT SON AGAIN COOL DOWN REST A THIRD AND A FOURTH TIME OKET SO TWO HOURS TOTAL IN THIS EIGHTY DEGREE SELSIES ENVIRONMENT  THAT'S A LOT BUT WHAT THEY OBSERVED WAS REALLY QUITE SIGNIFICANT SO THEY HAD SUBJECTS DO THIS PROTOCAL AND I SHOULD MENTION THEY HAD BOTH MALE AND FEMALE SUBJECTS IN THE STUDY AND THE ENTIRE STUDY LASTED A WEEK THEY DID THIS TWO HOURS OF SANA EXPOSURE ON DY ONE DAY THREE AND DA SEVEN OF THAT WEEK AND THEY MEASURED A LOT OF DIFFERENT HORMONS CORTISALL FIEROID STIMULATING HORMON FIREWORD HORMON ITSELF LUTINIZING HORMON AND FOLICAL STIMULATING HORMON WHICH ARE HORMONS THAT ESSENTIUALLY DRIVE THE PRODUCTION OF OTHERHORMONS WE WON'T GET INTO THAT A TWO DEEPLY BUT IF YOU LIKE TO LEARN ABOUT EFFASAGH FOLICAL STIMULATING HORMON AND LUTINIZING HORMON PLECEE THE EPISODE ON OPTIMIZING TESTASTRON IN ESTROGEN AT HUBERMANLABDATCAM THEY LOOKED AT PROLACTIN AND THEY LOOKED AT GROWTH HORMON I'LL JUST CUTS OF THE CHASE AND TELL YOU THE EFFECTS ON GROTH HORMON IN SUBJECTS THAT DID THIS TWO HOUR A DAY EIGHTY DEGREE SELCIOS PROTOCAL EXPERIENCED SIXTEEN FOLD INCREASES IN GROWTH HORMON SO THEY MEASURE GROWTHHORMON BEFORE THE SANA AND AFTER THE SANA AND GROTHORMON LEVELS WENT UP SIXTEEN FOLD WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY AN ENORMOUS AND IT TURNS OUT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT NOW ONE IMPORTANT AVIAT HERE REMEMBER EARLIER WHEN I TALKED ABOUT PEOPLE WHO DID SANA ONCE A WEEK VERSES TO THREE TIMES A WEEK VERSES FOR TO SEVEN TIMES A WEEK AND THE MORE OFTEN PEOPLE TO SANA THE LESS LIKELY THEY WERE TO DIE OF PARTY OF ASCULAR EVENTS OR OTHER THINGS OF THAT SORT WELL IN THIS CASE THE EFFECTS OF SAN EXPOSURE ON GROWTH HORMON ACTUALLY WHEN DOWN THE MORE OFTEN THAT PEOPLE DID THIS DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE SO AS IY MENTION THEY DID THIS TWO HOUR DAY DIVIDING THE THIRTY MINUTE SESSIONS PROTOCAL ON DAY ONE DAY THREE AND DAY SEVEN OF A WEEK AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS ON DAY ONE THERE WAS A SIXTEEN FOLD INCREASE IN GROWTH HORMON ON DAY THREE HOWEVER THERE WAS STILL A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON GROTHHORMON AS COMPARED TO BEFORSANA BUT THAT EFFECT WAS BASILY CUT BY TWO THIRDS OCA SO NOW INSTEAD OF GATING SIXTEEN FOLD INCREASE IT WAS MORE LIKE A THREE OR FORFOLD INCREASE WHICH IS STILL A HUGE INCREASE BUT NOT AS GREAT AS THE INCREASE OBSERVED ON DAY ONE AND THEN ON DAY SEVEN THERE TENDED TO BE A TWO MAY BE A THREEFOLD INCREASE BUT NOT AS GREAT AS THE ONE OBSERVED ON DAY ON WHAT DIS THIS MEAN AND WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN WELL THE REASON THIS HAPPENS IS BECAUSE HEAT JUST LIKE COLD IS A SHOCK OR A STRESSER TO THE SYSTEM IN THE CONTECTS OF COLD IF YOU GET INTO A VERY COLD ICE BATH FOR INSTANCE A FIVE DEGREE ICE BAT EVEN FOR TWENTY SECONDS IT'S KNOWN TO INCREASE NOR APINEFREN TWO HUNDRED PER CENT IT CAN DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF NORUPAN EFREN THEY OU SUDDENLY RELEASE INTO YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WHICH ACTUALLY CAN HAVE SOME PAUSIVE EFFECTS ILL TALK ABOUT THOSE IN LOBIT BUT IF YOU WERE TO DO THAT EVERY DAY YOU WOULD BECOME COLD ADAPTED THIS CIRCUIT THAT COMPARES THE SHELL IND CORE OF YOUR BODY WOULD ADJUST IN WAYS TH T IT COULD EITHER PREDICT THAT COLD STIMULUS OR MORE LIKELY TO CREATE SOME THERMOGENIC MECHANISMS IN PREPARATION FOR THAT COLD EXPOSURE THIS IS WHY FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE THAT USE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE TO TRY AND INCREASE LIPOLISIS THE BURNING OF FAT OFTENTIMES WILL GET RESULTS FOR WHILE BUT THEN IF THE'RE OING IT A LOT A LOT THEY STOP GETTING THOSE EFFECTS I TALK A LOT ABOUT AAITING COLD ADAPTATION IF THAT'S YOUR GOALD IN THE EPISODE ON COAL BUT SIMILAR MECHANISMS ARE AT PLAY HERE SO WE HAVE TO IMAGIN THAT WHEN THE SUBJECTS GOT INTO THE AUNON DE ONE WHATEVER PATHWAYS WENT FROM MEASUREMENT OF TEMPERATURE AT THE SHELL TO CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE AT THE CORE LED TO THESE BIG INCREASES IN GROWTHORMONE WHICH IS BASILY AWAY OF DUST DESCRIBING THE RESULT I ALREADY TOLD YOU BEFORE BUT THE FACT THAT THAT RESULT DIMINISHED OVER TIME EITHER MEANS THAT THE CIRCUIT WAS NOT AS EFFICIENT IN COMMUNICATING THAT SHIFT IN TEMPERATURE OR THAT THAT SHIFT IN TEMPERATURE WAS OF LESS IMPACT BECAUSE THE DOWNSTREAM EFFECTORERS WORE NOT ENGAGED TO THE SAME EXTENT BECAUSE IT WASN'T AS MUCH OF A SHOCK AND I THINK THE LATTER EXPLANATION IS FAR MORE LIKELY THIS IS VERY MUCH AKIN TO WAIT TRAINING OR CARDY OFASCULAR EXERCISE WHERE IF YOU RUN UP THA HILL VERY FAST FOR INSTANCE AND YOUR LUNGS AR BURNING AND YOUR HEAVING AND BREATHING HARD ON THE FIRST DAY THAT'S A VERY PAINFUL THING BUT IF YOU DO IT EVERY DAY OR EVERY OTHER DAY PROVIDE YOU ALLOW YOURSELF TO RECOVER PRESUME YOUR RUNNING UP THAT HILL AND YOUR NOT BREATHING IS HARD THERE ISN'T MUCH BURNING IN YOUR MUSCLES ET CETER ET CETERA YOUR BODY ADAPTS SO ONE OF THE KEY THINGS TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE USE OF DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE IT IN ORDER TO TRYING TRIGGER MASSIVE INCREASES IN GROWTHHORMON YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT NOT DOING IT MORE THAN LETS SAY ONCE A WEAK NOW I M EXTRAPOLATING FROM THE STUDY MAYBE ONCE EVERY TEN DAYS WOULD BE EVEN BETTER BUT IF YOU START GETTING HEAT ADAPTED IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET THESE MASSIVE INCREASES IN GROWTHHORMON SO I DON'T MEAN TO BE DISCOURAGING OF USING DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE TO ACCESS GROWTHHORMON INCREASES BUT IF THAT'S YOUR SPECIFIC GOAL OR YOUR MAIN GOAL THEN I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO SAY THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE AT LEAST NOT OF THE SORT THAT I DESCRIBE HERE MORE THAN ONCE A WEEK OR MAYBE EVEN ONCE EVERY TEN DAYS AND THAT YOU WOULD WANT A TIME THAT TO OTHER EVENTS IN YOUR LIFE MAY BE HARD WORK OUTS OR IF YOU ARE TRYING TO PUSH THROUGH A FAT LOST BARRIER OR SIMPLY IN ORDER TO ACCESS GROWTH HORMON AT PEAK LEVELS MAY BE THREE TIMES PER MONTH OR FOUR TIMES PERMONTH IF YOU START DOING DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE MORE OFTEN YOU'LL STILL GET INCREASES IN GROWTHORMON BUT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE NEARLY AS LARGE AS THET INCREASES IN GROWTHHORMON THAT YOU'RE GOING TO EXPERIENCE IF YOU SHOCK YOUR SYSTEM WITH THELEDELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE AN IMPORTANT WAY TO FRAME THIS IS ACTUALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF COLD AND WHILE YOU MIGHT SAY WAIGHT THIS IS AN EPISODE ON HEAT IN HEATING NOT COLD YOU REALLY CAN'T HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT HEAT AND HEATING WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT COLD BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IF YOU COOL THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR BODY THE SHELL YOUR ASHLY HEATING UP YOUR BODY IN FACT THE CIRCUITS THAT CONTROL L HEATING OF THE BODY IN THAT CONTROL COOLING OF THE BODY FOR INSTANCE THE ACTIVATION OF THINGS LIKE SHIVER OR FAT LOSS IN RESPONSE TO COLD AND SHIVER THOSE ARE ALSO CONTROLLED BY THE PREOPTIC AREA OF THE HYPOTHALMUS SO WE CAN TAKE A STEP BACK AND START TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO DESING THE OPTIMAL PROTOCAL FOR DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE BY LOOKING AT COLD AND HERE'S WHAT I MEAN THEREHAVE BEN BEAUTIFUL STUDY SHOWING THAT IF PEOPLE GET INTO A VERY COLD BODY OF WATER FOUR DEGREES SELSUS FOR TWENTY SECONDS AS I MENTION EARLIER THAT WILL CAUSE E A TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED PER CENT INCREASE IN NORAPANEFERON NORAPANEFERAN IS ALSO CALLED NORDREDALINE AND NOR UP AN EFFERON ANOTHER SO CALL CATACOLOMINES LIKE DOPOMINE INCREASE DRAMATICALLY IN THIS VERY BRIEF COLD WATER EXPOSURE AND THOSE INCREASES IN NORUPINEFRAN AND DOPOMINE ARE KNOWN TO HAVE LONG LASTING EFFECTS THAT GENERALLY TO IMPROVEMENTS IN MOOD FOCUS IN ALERTNES THEY'REPRETTY SIGNIFICANT HOWEVER THEY AREN'T SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO INCREASE METABOLISM TO A VERY HIGH DEGREE WHEREAS OTHER STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IF PEOPLE GO OUTSIDE IN SIXTEEN DEGREES SELSIUS WEATHER WITH A PROPER AMOUNT BUT FAIRLY MINIMUMAMOUNT OF CLOTHING YOU CAN EXPERIENCE EVEN GREATER INCREASES IN NORAPAN EFERON BUT THE TIME THAT'S REQUIRED IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE THOSE INCREASES IS SIX HOURS AT FOR INSTANCE SIXTEEN DEGRE TELSIUS SO IF YOU HAVE SIX HOURS A DAY TO BE OUT THERE IN THE COLDER IF YOU AN TURN THE AIR CONDITIONING ON AND AN ENVIRONMENT MAKE IT VERY VERY COLD T FINE BUT BASILY WHAT I AM DESCRIBING IS THAT YOU CAN SORT OF BOOK END THE PIRAMETERS THAT YOU CAN USE YOU CAN USE A VERY BRIEF EXPOSURE TO COLD OR TO HEAT IN ORDER TO STIMULATE HEAT SHOCK PROTINES GROWTH HARMON ET CETERA OR YOU CAN USE LONGER EXPOSURE IN LESS INTENSE VERSIONS OF HEAT AND COLD YOU REALLY HAVE TO FIND WHAT'S CAN A WORK FOR YOU AN WHAT YOU CAN DO SAFELY AND IF YOURE CONFUSED ABOUT WHERE TO START PLEASE USE THE PIRAMETERS THAT I DESCRIBED EARLIER FIRST OF ALL CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR AS ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT YOUARE SOMEBODY WHO CAN DO DELIBERATE COLD OR HEAT EXPOSURE SAFELY BUT THAT EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED DEGREES SELSIUS MEANING HUNDRED D SEVENTY SIXREES FOR INHEIT TO TWO HUNDRED AN TWELVE DEGEES FOR INHET THAT KEEP REPEATING OVER AND OVER CAUSE I KNOW SOMEBODIES GAN TO ASKUEN N I REPEAT IT OVER AND OVER WHICH IS FINUM AM DELAYED TO KEEP A KEEP SAYING IT AND TO RESPOND OF SONE ASKE AGAIN WELL THOSE PERAMETERS ARE GOING BOOKEND WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IN TERMS OF THE INTENSITY OF THE HEAT STIMULUS HOW LONG WELL WE HEARD EARLY ER FIVE TO TWENTY MINUTES WHY NOT START WITH FIVE AND THEN RAMP IT UP TO TEN OR FIFTEEN AND THEN IF YOUR FEELING REALLY BOLD AND YOU REALLY WANT A CRANK OUTCROTHHORMON WILL THEN YOU COULD DO THAT THIRTY MINUTE FOUR TIMES IN ONE DAY STIMULUS EVERYONES IN A WHILE SYOU HAVTER REALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUARE USING HEAT EXPOSURE FOR ITHIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WHEN PEOPLE SAY IS IT BETTER TO GET IN A WETSONOR OR DRISON O WHAT'S THE OPTIMAL TEMPERATURE AH IS IT BETTER TAKE A HOT SHOWER O HOT BATH OR A HOT OF TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO REGULARLY WHETHER NOT YOU WANT TO DO IT REGULARLY AND WHAT YOUR SPECIFIC COALS ARE SO THE PURPOSE OF THIS EPISODE IS REALLY TE ARMY WITH THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS AND ARMY W ITH THE GENERAL PERAMETERS THAT ARE GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO ACCESS THE RESULT S THAT YOUR SEEKING FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH I PERSONALLY USE A PROTOCOL AND I'VE BEEN USING A PROTOCOL FOR A LONG TIME THAT INVOLVES TRYING MEANING I COMPLISH THIS MOST WEEKS NOT ALL TRYING TO GET IN TO ASSNA FOR THREE TWENTY MINUTE SESSIONS EVERY WEEK I USE A DRYSANA SO IT'S NOT A STEAM ROOM IF I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO IT I MIGHT TAKE A HOT BATH OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT BUT IN GENERAL I JUST STICK TO DOING THE SAN A THREE TIMES A WEEP AND I GENERALLY WILL DO THAT EITHER AFTER A WORK OUT EITHER A CARDIOVASCULAR WORK OUT OR A WAKE WORK OUT OR I'LL DO IT LATER IN THE EVENING WHY LATER IN THE EVENING WELL ASKED TO DO WITH THE CIRCADIAN SHIFTS IN TEMPERATURE THAT WE ALL EXPERIENCE TALKE A LOT ABOUT THIS IN THE CIRCADIAN EPISODES AND THE EPISODES RELATE TO SLEEP BUT IN A NUTSHELL HEARS HOW IT WORKS EVERY EARLY MORNING ABOUT TWO HOURS BEFORE YOUR TYPICAL WAKE UP TIME YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE IS AT ITS ALL TIME LOWEST OQE WE CALL THAT YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM RIGHT ABOUT WAKING YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE INCREASES IN FACT AN INCREASE IN BODY TEMPERTURE IS PART OF THE REASON YOU WAKE UP AT ALL UNLESS OF COURSE YOU'RE SETTING AN ALARM INCREASES IN BODY TEMPERATURE ARE GOING TO BE ONE OF THE MAJOR THINGS THAT WAKES UP YOUR BRAIN AN BODY BODY TEMPERATURE WILL TEND TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE THROUGH THE MORNING YOUL GET THAT INCREASE IN CORTISALL THAT'S IN HEALTHY INCREA IN CORTISALL BODY TEMPERATURE WILL INCREASE INTO THE AFTERNOON AND THEN WILL START TO DROP IN THE LATER AFTERNOON THIS GENERAL CONTOUR CAN BE SHIFTED BY WHEATHER NOT YOU EXERCISE HOW OFTEN YOU EAT BECAUSE OF THE SO CALL THERMOGENIC EFFECTS OF FOOD THAT IS EVERY TIME YOU EAT THERE'S A SLIGHT INCREASE IN BODY TEMPRATURE METABOLISM BUT'S NUTS REALLY THAT SIGNIFICANT TO THROW OFF THIS GENERAL CONTOURAN RHYTHM BUT TOWARD THE AFTERNOON AROUND FOUR FIVE O'CLOCK MOST DAYS DEPENDING ON TIME OF YEAR YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WILL PIK AND THEN IT WILL START TO DROP AND AS YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE DROPS BY ONE TO THREE DEGREES IN HERE ON REFERRING TO YOUR COR BODY TEMPERATURE NOT YOUR SHELL BODY TEMPERATURE YOU WILL START TO GET SLEEPY AND TO TRANSITION INTO SLEEP AND TO MAINTAIN SLEEP THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WILL REMAIN LOW TO YOU HIT THAT TEMPERATURE MINIMUMEN THEY'LL TART TO COME UP AGAIN OQ WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT WHEN YOU DECIDE TO DO SANA OR COLD EXPOSURE FOR THAT MATTER IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT WHY WELL AS I MENTION EARLY IF YOU WERE TO MAKE THE SURFACE OF YOUR BODY COLD AT LEAST IN THE IMMEDIATE PERIOD AFTER THAT YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WILL INCREASE SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE CHALLENGE IN GETTING TO SLEEP AND ARE STILL WORKING ON YOUR SLEEP REMEMBER SLEEP IS THE FOUNDATION OF ALL MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH AND OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE YOU SHOULD TRY TO GET REALL EQUALITY SLEEP OF SUFFICIENT DURATION AT LEAST EIGHTY PER CENT OF NIGHTS THAT SHOULD BE AN ONGOING GOL THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE SPEN FOR A HUGE NUMBER OF REASONS WATCH THE MASTER SLEEP EPISODE IF YOU LIKE TO HEAR MORE OF THOSE REASONS THAN THE MECHANISMS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO THAT BUT IN ANY EVENT COLD EXPOSURE LATE IN THE EVENING WILL START TO INCREASE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE AGAIN AND THAT CAN MAKE IT HARD FOR SOMP PEOPLE TO FALL ASLEEP NOW IF YOUR VERY VERY TIRE ED BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN WORKING HARD OR TRAINING HARD OR BOTH THROUGHOUT THE DAY MAY NOT THROW OFF YOUR SLEEP SO MUCH I'VE GONE THROUGH BOUTS WHERE I'M JUST SO SO BUSY FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT THAT THE ONLY TIME I CAN GET INTO THE ICE BTH OF THE COLD SHOUERS LATE IN THE EVENING AND I HAVE NO TROUBLE SLEEPING AFTER THAT HOWEVER YOU HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING I WOULD RECOMMEND DOING THE COAL EXPOSURE EARLY IN THE DAY TO MATCH THAT NATURAL HEATING THAT NATURAL INCREASE IN BODY TEMPRATURE THAT OCCURS ACROSS THE TWENTY FOUR HOUERS SO CALLED CIRCADIAN RHYTHM SIMILARLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE YOU' BE WISE TO DO THAT LATER IN THE DAY YOU' BE WISE TO DO IT LATER IN THE DAY BECAUSE WHEN YOUE GET INTO A WARM ENVIRONMENT SURE THE SURFACE OF YOUR BODY THE SHELL HEATS UP THE CORE OF YOUR BODY HEATS UP BUT THEN IT ALSO ACTIVATES COOLING MECHANISMS THROUGH THE PREOPTIC AREA AND WHEN YOU GET OUT OF THAT HOT ENVIRONMENT SONER OTHERWISE YOUR BODY WILL CONTINUE TO COOL DOWN AND SO MANY PEOPLE FIND THAT IF THEY DO SAN IT IN THE LATER HALF OF THE DAY OR EVEN JUST BEFORE SLEEP AND THEN TAK A WARM AS SHOWER AFTERWARDS THEN THEY FIND IT EASIER TO FALL ASLEEP AND THAT MAKE SENSE BECAUSE THEIR BODY TEMPERATURE IS DROPPING AND IN FACT IF YOUR GOAL IS TO REALY PROMOTE THE MAXIM AMOUNT OF GROWTHHOMEON RELEASE THAT'S ALSO GOING TO BE THE BEST TIME OF DAY TO DO IT ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVENAN EATEN IN THE TWO HOUERS BEFORE SLEEP GISO IF YOU'RE REALLY GOING FOR GROWTHOMONE RELEASE YOUR REALLY TRYNOPTIMIZE SLEEP AND THE TWO THINGS ARE ACTUALLY LINKED BECAUSE OF THE RELEASE OF GROTHOMON THE HAPPENS FROM THE PATUITARY IN THE EARLY NIGHTS SLEEP WELL THEN YOU WOULD BE WISE TO DO YOUR SANA MAY BE WONCE OR MAY BE TWICE A WEEK IN THE EVENING OR AT NIGHT TIME THAN TAKING A WARM OR COOL SHOWER JUST BRIEFLY JUST ENOUGH TO ACCOUNT O RINS OFF ALL THE SWEAT FROM THE SANA AND THEN GET READY FOR SLEEP AND TO DO THAT NOT NECESSARILY FASTED BUT TO TRY AND KEEP YOUR LEVELS OF GLUCOS AND INSOLEN SOMEWHAT LOW IN YOUR BLOOD STREAM THE REASON I SAY THAT IS THAT HAVING ELEVATED BLOOD GLUCOS AND OR INSOLEN TENDS TO BLUNT OR REDUCE GROWTHHOME ON RELESE AND THAT'S TRUE FOR ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STIMULI INCLUDING EXERCISE AND INCLUDING SANA SHE'S A REALLY NICE STUDY ON THIS THAT I CAN POINT YOU TO S THE TUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHD IN THE JOURNAL STRESS LITERALLY THAT'S THE NAME OF THE JOURNAL I LOVE IT WHEN JOURNALS HAVE THESE NAMES LIKE PAIN OR STRESS I FIND THAT SOMEWHAT AMUSING FOR REASONS THAT ESCAPE ME BUT NONE THE LESS AMUSE ME THE TITLE OF THES STUDY IS GROWTHHOME ON RESPONSE TO DIFFERENT CONSECUTIVE STRESS STIMULE IN HEALTHY MEN IS THERE ANY DIFFERENCE AND I DON'T WANT TO GOINTO ALL THE DETAILS OF THE STUDY BECAUSE ITS PRETTY EXTENSIVE AND COMPLICATED BUT BASY WHAT IT IS THAT THEY HAD PEOPLE DO SANA AND THEN GAVE THEM A DRUG OR A CONDITION OF HAVING LOW NOT DANGEROUSLY LOW BUT LOW BLOOD SUGAR OR THEY HADE THEM IN A CONDITION WHERE THEY HAD LOW BLOOD SUGAR AND THEN DID SANA OR THEY HADE THEM DO AN EXERCISE PROTOCAL THAT LED THEM TO INCREASE GROWTHHORMON AND THEN HADE THEM DO LOBLUTCHER BASELY MIXING AND MATCHING THE VARIOUS STIMULE THAT COULD INCREASE GROWTHHORMAN AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD HAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT DOING SANA ONCE AND THEN WAITING SOME PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN LAYER THAT DAY DOINGSANA AGAIN THEY DIDN'T SEE THE SAME INCREASE IN GROWTH HORMON BOTH TIMES FIRST THEY GOT A BIG INCREASING GROWTHHORMON AND THEN LESS IF THEY DISANA AGAIN IF THEY HAD PEOPLE DO EXERCISE AND THEN SANA WHAT THEY FOUND WAS EXERCISE COULD STIMULATE GROWTH HORMON BUT THEN FALLING IT WITH SANA DID NOT ALLOW YOU TO GET TWICE AS MUCH GROWTH HORMON IN GENERAL ANY TIME YOUR RELEASE GROWTH HORMON YOU REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU'R GING TO RELEASE GROWTH HORMON AGAIN LATER THAT DAY AND THIS PARTIALLY EXPLAINS THAT EARLIER STUDY WHERE IF PEOPLE DID THIS GROWTH HORMON PROMOTING PROTOCAUL ON DAY ONE BUT THEN ON DAY THREE THAT IDN'T SEE QUITE AS BIG IN A FACT AN ON E SEVEN THEY DIDNSEQUIT AS BIG EFFECT ALL A BASINGLY BOILS DOWN TO IS THAT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO CRANK OUT THE MOST AMOUNT OF GROWTH HORMONA RESPONS TO SANA DO IT FASTED OR AT LEAST NOT HAVING INJESTED ANY FOOD IN THE TWO OR THREE HOURS BEFORE YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE DEEP INTO A FAST AND TH WHOLE NOTION OF WHAT BREAKS A FAST IS KIND OF AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION BECAUSE IT'S CONTEXTUAL RIGHT WILL ASIPICOFFEE BREAK YOUR FAST WELL MAY BE PROBABLY NOT WILL ONE GRAIN OF SUGAR AND BREAK YOUR FAST NO WILL A YOU KNOW AN ENTIRE CANDY BARBREAK YOUR FAST YES IT HAS TO DO WITH WHERE YOUR BLOOD LUCOS IS WHEN YOU INJEST THAT PARTICULAR FOOD IDAM NOT SO MUCH WHAT THAT FOOD ITAM IS PERSAY BUT THE BOTTOM LINE HERE AS IF YOU WANT O CRANK OUT THE MOST AMOUNT OF GROWTH HORMON GET WAIT A COUPLE OF HOURS AFTER EATING BEFORE GETTING INTO THE SANA  MAYBE DO IT BEFORE DINNER AND THEN PREPARE DINNER DO THE SANA BEFORE DINNER THAT IS THEN PREPARE DINNER THEN EAT DINNER AND THEN MAKE SURETHAT YOU WAIT A FEU HOURS BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP YOU'RE GOING TO HAFE TO ARRANGE YOUR SCHEDUL AACCORDINGLY I KNOW MOST PEOPLE CEN ARRANGE ARE SCETTUAL PERFECTLY JUST TO GET GROWTH HORMON INCREASES NOR DO I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD APPROACH HEALTH PROTO CALLS THAT WAY I THINK FOR NINETY PERCENT OF PEOPLE NINETY PER CENT OF THE TIME JUST GETTING INTO THE SANA ONCE OR TWICE OR THREE TIMES A WEEK IS GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE NUMBER OF REASONS THAT I DESCRIBED EARLIER AND YOU DON'T WNT OBSESS TOO MUCH ABOUT THE EXACT CONDITIONS YOU NEED IN ORDER TO GET THE GREATEST EFFECT AT OF THAT SANA TREATMENT THESE ARE JUST SOME ADDITIONAL TWEEKS RELATED TO FOOD AND TAKE AND LOW LEVEL HYPOGLYCEMIA AND EXERCISE THAT IF YOU WANTED TO LEVERAGE YOU COULD SO IF DECREASES IN BODY TEMPERATURE TEND TO AID THE TRANSITION O SLEEP AND GETTING OUT OF A HOTSANA TENDS TO PROMOT DECREASES IN BODY TEMPERATURE IT MAKE SENSE WHY YOU WOULD WANT TO PUT YOUR SANA EXPOSURE OR OTHER DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE IN THE SECOND HALF OF YOUR DAY AND MAYBE VEN RIGHT BEFORE SLEEP NOW REGARDLESS OF WHAT TIME OF DAY YOU DUSANA OR HOW FREQUENTLY YOU DO IT YOUARE GOING TO WANT TO HYDRATE AFTER GOING IN THE SANA WHEN YOU GO IN THE SANA YOU LOSE WATER AND WHEN YOU LOSE WATER YOU NEED TO REPLACE IT WHY WELL YOU NEED WATER FOR ALL YOURSELVES BUT YOU ALSO NEET ELECTROLITE SO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR REPLACING THE WATER THAT YOU LOSE IN THE SANA NOW THERE'S NO EXACT FORMULA OF HOW MUCH WATER TO DRINK AND WHETHER NOT YOU NEED ELECTROLIGHTS IN THAT WATER OR NOT I'S GOING TO DEPEND ON HOW MUCH YOU SWEAT MEANING HOW HEAT ADAPTED YOU ARE IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON HOW MUCH SALT YOU TEND TO IT SCRE E IN YOUR SWEAT HUGE AMOUNT OF VARIATION BUT IN GENERAL ONE WAY TO APPROACH THUS WOULD BE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DRINK AT LEAST SIXTEEN OUNCES OF WATER FOR EVERY TEN MINUTES THAT YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN THE SANA YOU COUN O THAT BEFORE ENDURING END AFTER YOU COUN O IT DURING AND AFTER OR YOU COUL DO IT AFTER NOW THERE ARE OTHER REASONS TO DO DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH CARDIOFVASCULAR FACTS NOTHING DO WITH GROWTH HORMON OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT BUT RATHER HAVE TO DO WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH IN FACT THE DATA RELATED TO SANA AND OTHER DEFORMS OF DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE IMPROVING MOOD ARE VERY IMPRESSIVE BOTH THAT THE MECHANISTIC LEVEL AND IN TERMS OF THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO ASK HOW IS IT THAT DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE CAN IMPROVE OUR MOOD AND WELL BEING WHILE IT TURNS OUT THAT IT IMPROVES MOOD AND WELL BEING BUT IT ALSO IMPROVES ARE CAPACITY TO FEEL GOOD IN RESPONSE TO THINGS THAT WOULD ORDINARILY MAKE US FEEL SOMEWHAT GOOD NOW THIS IS NOT A SITUATION WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO BE WALKING AROUND GRINNING ER TO EAR IN RESPONSE TO NOTHING AT ALL SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU WENT IN A SANA WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT IS THE UPREGULATION OF PATHWAYS MEANING CHEMICAL PATHWAYS IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY THAT ALLOW YOU TO EXPERIENCE PLEASURE IN ALL ITS FULLNESS SO HEARS HOW THIS WHOLE DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE SANA MOOD THING WORKS MANY OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD OF IN DORPHANS AND DORHANS ARE A CATEGORY OF MOLECULES THAT ARE MADE NATURALLY IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY AND THAT ARE RELEASED IN RESPONSE TO DIFFERENT FORMS OF STRESSERS THAT'S RIGHT IN RESPONSE TO STRESSER SO EVER YOU'VE GONE OUT ON A LONG RUN AND AT SOME POINT THAT RUN YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR ACHING IN YOUR JOINTS HEARDOR MAY BE OF SHIN SPLINS AND YOU PUSH THROUGH THAT PART OF THE REASON THAT YOU EXPERIENCE A LACK OF PAIN AT SOME POINT USUALLY OR YOU EXPERIENCE A UFORIA JURING OR AFTER THAT EXERCISE IS THE EXERCISE INDUCED EFFECTS ON INDORPHAN RELEASE OR RATHER TO BE MORE SPECIFIC I SHOULD SAY THE EXERCISE INDUCED CONSEQUENCES ON THE STRESS SYSTEM WHICH IN TURN TRIGGER THE RELEASE OF INDORPHAN IN OTHER WORDS WHEN WE EXPERIENCE SHORT TERM OR ACUTE STRESS THE INDORPHAN SYSTEM IS ACTIVATED AND THE INDORPHAN SYSTEM IS NOT JIOUS ABOUT FEELING GOOD BELIEVE ITARE NOT IT'S ALSO ABOUT FEELING BAD ND THE TWO GENERAL CATEGORIES OF INDORPHANS THE FIRST ARE THE ONES THAT YOU NORMALLY HEREABOUT IN DORPHANS THINGS THAT BIND FOR INSTANCE TO RECEPTORS LIKE THE MEU OPIOID RECEPTOR OPIOIDS ARE NOT JUST PRESCRIBED COMPOUNDS OR UNFORTUNATELY DRUGS OF ABUSE WHICH THEY ARE RIGHT WE HAVE THIS OPIOID CRISIS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE WHICH IS A VERY SERIOUS AND TRAGIC THING BUT WE MAKE INDOGENOUS OPIOIDS WE MAKE INDORPHANS THAT NATURALLY ACT AS PAIN RELIEVERS AND THAT MAKE US FEEL MILDLY EUFORIC WE ALSO MAKE IN DORPHANS SUCH AS DINORPHAN THAT'S D WI N O ARE P H IEN DIN NORPHAN THAT ACTUALLY MAKE US FEEL WORSE IN RESPONSE DISTRESSORS WHEN WE GET INTO A HOT SANA OR A HOT ENVIRONMENT OF ANY KIND DINORPHANS ARE LIBERATED IN THE BRAIN ENBODY AND I SHALD MENTION THAT DINORPHANS ARE MADE BY MANY NORANS IN MANY DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE BRAIN MIGHT THINK WELL BY WHAT I WANT THAT WHY WOALD I WANT OF RELEASE DINORPHAN INTO MY BRAIN EBODY WELL FIRST OF ALL WHEN YOU GET INTO AN UNCOMFORTABLY HOT SITUATION UNCOMFORTABLY HOT SENARIO ON GASHTHIS IS SOUNDING TERRIBLE AND A DELIBERATELY HOT ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU ARE USING TO TRY IND TRIGGERRSOME SORT OF BIOLOGICAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFIT I SHOULD SAY THE DISCOMFORT THAT YOU FEEL THE DESIRE TO GET OUT OF THAN THAT ENVIRONMENT IS IN PART THE CONSEQUENTE OF THE RELEASE OF DINORPHAN IT'S ALSO THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE ACTIVATION F THAT SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM REMEMBER THE PREOPTICARRY A CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THE MIGDOLA AND TRIGGER THAT ON FIGHT OR FLIGHT MODA WON GET OUT OF THE SANA THIS IS REALLY REALLY HOT BUT DINORPHAN IS ALSO LIBERATED FROM A CERTAIN NUMBER OF NURANS DINORPHAN BINDS TO WHAT'S CALLED THE CAPA RECEPTOR THE CAPAR RECEPTOR BINDS DINORPHAN AND TRIGGERS PATHWAYS IN THE BRAIN EN BODY THAT LEAD TO AGITATION TO STRESS AND BELIEVE IT ARE NOT TO A GENERAL SENSE OF PAIN THIS IS WHY YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF THE HOTSANA AND REMEMBER IF IT'S UNSAFE LEVELS OF HOT THAN YOU SHOULD GET OUT OF THAT SANA OR OTHER HOT ENVIRONMENT BUT IF YOUR WORKING IN ARRANGE ARE YOURE EXPOSING YOURSELF TO ARRANGE OF HEAT THAT'S UNCOMFORTABLE BUT SAFE TO BE IN DINORPHAN WILL BE LIBERATED FROM THESE NORANS BIND TO THE CAPA RECEPTOR AND AS A DOWNSTREAM CONSEQUENSE OF THAT THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE IN THE RECEPTORS THAT BINE THE OTHER INDORPHANS THE ENDORPHANS THAT MAKE YOU FEEL SOOTHED THAT MAKE YOU FEEL HAPPY AND THAT MAKE YOU FEEL MILD EUPHORIA SO THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF STUDY SHOWING THAT INITIALLY DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE BYSANA OR OTHERWISE CAUSES THE RELEASE OF DINORPHAN IN FACT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT EVERY TIME WE GET INTO A HOT ENVIRONMENT THAT'S UNCOMFORTABLE OR A COLD ENVIRONMENT THAT'S UNCOMFORTABLE DINORPHAN IS LIKELY RELEASED AND BINDING THE CAPA RECEPTOR BUT OVER TIME THAT BINDING OF DINORPHAN TO THE CAPAR RECEPTOR LEADS TO DOWNSTREAM CHANGES IN THE WAY THAT THE FEEL GOOD INDORPHANS THINGS LIKE INDORPHAN BINDING TO THE MUOPIAD RECEPTOR AND THERE ARE STILL OTHER FEEL GOOD INDORPHANS SO TO SPEAK THAT SYSTEM BECOMES MOGST MUCH MORE EFFICIENT SUCH THAT PEOPLE FEEL AN ELEVATION IN THEIR BASELINE LEVEL OF MOOD AND WHEN A GOOD OR HAPPY EVENT COMES ALONG THEY FEEL A HEIGHTEN LEVEL OF HAPPINESS OR JOY OR AWE OR IMPROVE MOOD IN RESPONSE TO THAT THIS IS NOT UNLIKE THE EFFECTS OF CAFFIN ON THE DOPENING RECEPTOR THAT IHAVE DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY AND FOR THOSE YE THER ARE'T FAMILIAR WITH IT MANY OF YOU DRINK CAFFINE AND LOVE IT PART OF THE REASON YOU LOVE IT IS BECAUSE OF THE RELEASE OF CERTAIN ARCHEMICALS LIKE NORUPENEFRAN ET CETERA THE ENERGY THAT IT GIVES YOU MAY BE THE TA ASTE I WOULD HOPE AS WELL BUT CAFFIN INGESTION ALSO CAUSES INCREASES IN DOPEMING RECEPTOR CONCENTRATION AND EFFICACY INOTHERWORS IT ALLOWS THE RECEPTORS FOR DOPAMINE TO WORK BETTER SO THAT FOR A GIVEN AMOUNT OF DOPEMING RELEASE YOU EXPERIENCE MORE PLEASURE AND MOTIVATION THIS IS A SIMILAR MECHANISM BUT WITHIN THE INDORPHAN PATHWAY SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN IT MEANS THAT A LITTLE BIT OF DISCOMFORT AS A CONSEQUENCE OF DELIBERAE HEAT EXPOSURE WHILE IN THE SHORT TERM DOESN'T FEEL GOOD BY DEFINITION IT IS ACTIVATING PATHWAYS THAT ARE ALLOWING THE FEEL GOOD MOLECULES AND NORAL CIRCUITRIES THAT EXIST IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY TO INCREASE THEIR EFFICIENCY PLACING YOU IN A BETTER POSITION TO BE JOYFUL IN RESPONSE TO THE EVENTS OF LIFE I CONFESS ON VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE DATA ON DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN THE CHEMICAL SYSTEMS THAT UNDERLIE GOOD MOOD AND JUST TO UNDERSCORE THIS FURTHER THE DINORPHAN SYSTEM IS NOT UNIQUE TO HEAT INDU STRESS IN FACT THEIARE BEAUTIFUL STUDIES AND REVIEWS OUT THERE ABOUT THE ROLE OF DINORPHAN IN STRESS AND DEPRESSION IN STRESS AND ALCOHOLISM JUST AS A BRIEF ASIDE AND IN THE FUTURE WE WILL DO A HOLE EPISODE ON ALCOHOL AND ALCOHOLISM BUT TURNS OUT THAT CHRONIC ALCOHOL USE AND ALCHOLISM CAUSES CHANGES IN DOPAMING RECEPTORS THAT MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE PLEASURE THROUGH THINGS OTHER THAN ALCOHOL AND EVEN ALCOHOL THAT'S COUNT OF THE OU REALLY DIABOLICAL NATURE OF A DICTION WHICH IS THE THING THAT INITIALLY BRINGS PLEASURE EVENTUALLY IS JUST REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN BASELINE LEVELS OF DOPAMINE AND I'VE TALKD BEFORE AND DOCTOR ONALEMCI WHEN SHE WAS A GESSED ON THIS PODCAST TALKED ABOUT THE PLEASURE PLEAN BALANCE THAT EXISTS WITHIN THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM IS BEAUTIFULLY DESCRIBED IN HER BUT DOPAMING NATION BY THE WAY EXCELLENT BOOK I RECOMMEND TO ALL PEOPLE ATTICS OR NOT WELL IN THAT CONTACT OF PLEASURE AND PAIN TS VERY CLEAR WHAT THE PLEASURE MOLECULE IS THATS TESHA MOLECULE MORE RELATED TO MOTIVATION AND THAT'S DOPAMINE THE PAIN MOLECULE HOWEVER APPEARS TO BE DINORPHAN AND THE FACT THAT DINORPHAN IS DISREGULATED INSTRESS IN DEPRESSION AND ALCOHOLISM AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DINORPHAN AN DOPAMINE IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD ALL TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY AND FOR THAT REASON I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE FACT THAT DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE CAND LEVERAGE O THE DINORPHAN SYSTEM IN A SHORT TERM IN N ACUTE WAY THAT ALLOWS MOOD TO IMPROVE AFTER THE SON EXPOSURE SO FOR THOSE WHO THAT DON'T LIKE HEAT EXPOSURE KEEP IN MIND THAT A LOT OF THE OBSERVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON OUR BIOLOGY RELATE TO METABOLISM CARDOVASCLA FUNCTION BUT ALSO MENTAL HEALTH AND ALONG THOSE LINES THERE IS A WONDERFUL STUDY AGAIN PUBLISHED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN I DOTNOW WI GAS TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS A BIG YEAR FOR A TE LIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE STUDIES A THE THE TITLE OF THIS STUDY IS SON A BATHING AND RISK OF SYC COTIC DISORDERS AND THIS WAS A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY AGAIN WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THIS STUDY IT'S A REALY INTERESTING STUDY THAT EXPLORED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MENTAL HEALTH SO PEOPLE PSUFFERING FROM VARIOUS FORMS OF PSYCHOSES SKIS AFFRENNIANOTHER FORMS OF PSYCHOSES AN USE OF SANA SO SENTUALLY WHAT THE STUDY DID IS THEY LOOKED AT A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF PSUBJECTS MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND SUBJECTS WHO HAD NO HISTORY OF PSYCOTIC DISORDERS THEY WERE CLASSIFIED INTO THREE GROUPS BASED ON THEIR FREQUENCY OF SANA USE EITHER ONCE A WEEK TWO TO THREE TIMES PER WEEK OR FOR TO SEVEN TIMES PER WEEK THIS SHOULD CALL TO MIND THAT EARLIER STUDY ON ALL RISK MORTALITY AND CARTIOVASCULAR EVENT RISK AND THEN THEY EXPLORED THE HAZARD RATIO FOR PSYCOSIS SPECIFICALLY MEANING HOW LIKELY IT WAS THAT PEOPLE WOULD DEVELOP PSYCOTIC SYMPTOMS OR FULBLOWN PSYCOTIC A ILLNESS ACCORDING TO THEI FREQUENCY OF SONA SESSION SO AGAIN THIS ISN'T CAUSAL THIS IS CORRELATIVE AND ACCORDING TO THE DATE ON THE STUDY WHAT THEY CONCLUDED IS THAT THERE WAS A STRONG AND INVERSE INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FREQUENT SONA BATHING AND THE FUTURE RISK OF PSYCOTIC DISORDERS IN THIS POPULATION THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT GOING TO ASONA SEVEN TIMES PER WEK IS GOING TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BECOMING SCHISOPHRENIC NECESSARILY OR FROM HAVING A PSYCOTIC EPISODE NECESSARILY END OF COURSE FREQUENT SONA USE WILL BE RELATED TO OTHER HEALTH PROMOTING ACTIVITIES BUT IN THIS STUDY AS IN THE PREVIOUS STUDY THEY WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS IN ORDER TO TRY AND LIMIT THOS SO CALLED CONFOUNDING VARIABLES NOW COURSEIS IS JUST ONE STUDY AND AGAIN ITS CORRLATIVE NOT CAUSAL BUT BASED ON THE LARGE NUMBER OF PSUBJECTS THEY INCLUDED PLUSS THE RIGOR OF THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WE STRANGE TO SEE A GENERAL PICTURE THAT USING THE SORTS OF SONA PROTOCALS THAT HAVE DESCRIBED THROUGHOUT THIS EPISODE MIGT FIVE TO TWENTY MINUTES OR SO DONE ONE TO SEVEN TIMES PER WEEK IS ASSOCIATED WITH A GENERAL IMPROVEMENT IN CARTIOVASCULAR HEALTH A GENERAL IMPROVEMENT IN MENTAL HEALTH AND IT REALLY POINTS TO THE FACT THAT YES SANA DONE ACUTELY FOR THREE OR FOUR TIMES A DAY THIRTY MINUTES EACH SESSION SEPARATED BY A COOLING MAY BE GETTING INTO COLBATH SURE THAT CAN POTENTLY INCREASE GROWTH HARMONE BUT DONE ON A MORE REGULAR BASIS CAN REDUCE CORTIZAL IMPROVE HEARTHEALTH IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH AND FOR THAT REASON AND THE FACT THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE IT IS CONCEIVABLE TO COME UP WITH A WAY THAT YOU COULD GET INTO DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE FOR A MINIMUM OF COST RIGHT IT'S A HOT BATH OR IF YOU HAD TO RESORT TO YOU KNOW BUNDLING UP AND GOING FOR A JOG THIS SORT OF THING OR IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO IT ASONA OF SOME SORT THAT WEE REALLY TALKING ABOUT A STIMULUS TO INITIATE A LARGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BIOLOGICAL CASCADES THAT WEAK OUT TO IMPROVE MULTIBLE ASPECTS OF BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH SOPE UNTIL NOW I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHOLE BODY HEATING SO FOR INSTANCE PUTING YOUR WHOLE BODY INTO THE SONA WHICH OF COURSE IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE DO OR GETTING INTO A HOT TOP OR HOT BATH UP TO YOUR NECK OR IN THE CASES WHERE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AS A MEANS TO INCREASE CORER BODY TEMPERATURE IN METAPOLISM GETTING INTO AN ICE BAFH OR COLD WATER OF SOME SORT UP TO YOUR NACK ARE INTO A COLD SHOWER ET CETERA NOW I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT DELIBERATELY HEATING OR COOLING SPECIFIC PARTS OF THE BODY MEANING CERTAIN SURFACE AREAS OF YOUR BODY AS A MEANS TO GET AFFECTS ON THOSE PARTICULAR AREAS AS WELL AS AT THE WHOLE BODY LEVEL NUMEROUS TIMESTHROUGHOUT THIS EPISODE I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE DANGERS OF OVER HEATING SO WHAT SHOULD YOU DO IF YOU THINK YOU OR SOME ONE ELSE IS HYPER THERMIC IS TOO HOT WELL IF YOU UNDERSTAND JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE COOLING IN HEATING SYSTEMS OF YOUR SHELL AND CORE THERE ARE SOME TERRIFIC TOOLS THAT YOU CAN USE IN ORDER TO COOL OFF YOUR COR QUICKLY AND REMEMBER THE CORE CONSISTS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THE SPINAL CORT IN THE VICERA WHICH ARE REALLY THE ORGANS YOURE TRYING TO PROTECT SO BEING ABLE TO COOL OFG THE CORE OF YOUR BODY QUICKLY CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL AND IN SOME CASE IT COULD EVEN SAVE YOUR LIFE THERE IS A WAY TO MORE QUICKLY HEAT OR COOL THE BODY AND THAT'S THROUGH SPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF YOUR SHELL MEANING PARTICULAR SKIN SURFACES I'VE TALKED EXTENSIVELY ABOUT THIS IN THE EPISODE ON COLD IT WAS ALSO COVERED IN THE EPISODE WITH MY GUESTS DOCTOR CRAG HELLER FROM THE BIOLOGY DEPARTMENT AT STAMFORD IT RELATES TO THE SO CALLED GALABORAUTS SKIN SURFACES ON THE UPPER HALF OF OUR FACE PALMS OF OUR HANDS AND THE BOMBS OF OUR FEET AND FOR THOSE AREYOUTHER HEARD THIS BEFORE I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO LISTEN NONE THE LESS BECAUSE TO DAY I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT SPECIFICALLY HOW TO HEAT THE BODY OR COOL THE BODY THROUGH THESE GLABER SKIN SURFACES VERY BRIEFLY THE MECHANISM IS AS FOLLOWS THE PALMS OF OUR HANDS THE BOMBS OF OUR FEET IN THE UPPER HALF OF OUR FACE OVERLIE SPECIFIC TYPES OF VASCULATURE MEANING SPECIFIC TYPES OF VEINS AND ARTERIES THAT DON'T HAVE CAPALARIES BETWEEN THEM AND AS A CONSEQUENCE HEAT AND COLD CAN MOVE VERY QUICKLY FROM THE PALMS OF TE HANDS THE BOMS OF THE FEET IN THE UPPER HALF OF OUR FACE AND CHANGE OUR CORPE BODY TEMPERATURE THERE IS A NAME FOR THESE PARTICULAR VASCULAR STRUCTURES THAT ARE CALLED AVIAS OR ARTERIO VENOUS ASTEMOSIES BASICALLY VEINS AND ARTERIESE INTERACTING DIRECTLY WITHOUT CAPALARIES IN BETWEEN WHICH ALLOWS COOLING OF BLOOD OR HEATING OF BLOOD MUCH MORE QUICKLY THAN AS POSSIBLE BY APPLYING COLD OR HEAT ELSEWHERE ON THE BODY WHERE CAPALARIES INTERVENE BETWEEN VEINS AND ARTERIES THESE A VAS ARTERIOVANEOUS ESTEMOSES CAN BE LEVERAGE TO COOL OFF YOUR CORP BODY TEMPRATURE VERY QUICKLY THE KEY THING IS TO GET THE PALMS OF YOUR HANDS THE BOMS OF YOUR FEET AND THE UPPER HALF YOUR FACE INCONTACT WITH A COLD SURFACE OR FLUID THAT IS COLD ENOUGH TO COOL THE BLOOD AND THE CORE OF YOUR BODY BUT NOT SO COLD THAT IT CONSTRICTS THE VEINS JUST BELOW THE PALMS OF YOUR HANDS BAMS ORF YOUR FEET OR THE UPPER HALF YOUR FACE SO NOT PLACING ICE PACKS NECESSARILY BUT MAY BE PLACING COOL TOWELS ON THE BOMS OF FEET THE PALMS OF THE HANDS AN THE UPPER HALF OF THE FACEAND AS THEY WARM UP REPLACING THOSE WITH OTHER COOL TELLS THE EXACT TEMPERATURE WILL DEPEND ON HOW HOT YOU HAPPEND TO BE I CAN'T KNOW THAT WITHOUT KNOWING YOUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES IF YOU LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW TO COOL OFF YOUR CORE VERY QUICKLY AND SOME OF THE DETAILS AND SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED TO DO THAT PLE SEE THE EPISODE I DOD WITH CRAGHELLER OR THE EPISODE ON COLD IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO THOSE EPISODES HEREIS A GOOD PROCEDURE THAT YOU COULD USE YOU COULD GRAB FOR INSTANCE A PACKAGE OF FROZEN BROCKLY OR FROZEN BLUEBERRIES IF SOME ONE IS REALLY REALLY WARM MAKE SURE THEY TAKE OFF THEIR SHOOES AND SOCKS GET THEIR FEET ON TOP OF THOSE I DEALLY GET SOME INTO THEIR HANDS AS WELL GET SOME COOL COMPRESSES AND GET THEM ON TO PEOPLE'S FACE YOU COULD OF COURSE ALSO PUT A COOL COMPRESS ON THE BACK OF THE NECK ON THE TOP OF THE HEAD THAT WOULD BE AN ESPECIALLY GOOD IDEA IF SOME ONE WERE HYPERTHERMIC BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT COOLING OF THE BRAIN OCCURS UNDER CONDITIONS OF HYPEROTHERMIA BUT THE KEY POINT HERE IS THAT JUST PUTTING COLD COMPRESSES OR COLD MATERIALS ON TO SOMEBODY'S TORSO IS NOT GOING TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS COOLING THOSE GLABER SKIN SURFACES THE BAMS OF THE FEET THE PALMSOF THE HANDS IN THE UPPER HALF OF THEIR FACE SIMILARLY OR I SUPPOSE TO BE MORE ACCURATE I SHOULD SAY CONVERSELY THERE ARE TIMES WHEN IT IS DESIRABLE TO HEAT THE CORE OF THE BODY AND ONCE AGAIN JUST SIMPLY THROWING A HOT TOWEL OVER SOMEBODY IS NOT GOING TO BE THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY IF SOME ONE IS HYPOTHERMIC THEI'R TOO COLD IT IS NOT A PROBLEM TO COVER THEM WITH A BLANKET BUT IDEALLY WHAT YOU DO IS YOU USE SOME WARM OBJECT OR WARM FLUID TO WARM THE BOTTOMS OF THEIR FEET THEIR HANDS AND THE UPPER HALF OF THEIR FACE OF COURSE NOT SO WARM THAT YOU BURN THOSE SKIN SURFACES THIS IS ACTUALY BEEN EXAMINED IN STUDIES FROM THE HELLER LAB TURNS OUT THAT FOR INSTANCE YOU GET PEOPLE OUT OF ANASTHESIA IT IS BENEFICIAL TO WARM THEIR CORBODY TEMPERATURE AND OF COURSE THERE IS FEVER WHICH YOU SHOULD KNOW IS AN ADAPTIVE RESPONSE WHILE FEVER IS UNCOMFORTABLE AND IN FACT OFTEN INVOLVES A MISMATCH BETWEEN OUR PERCEPTION OF OUR SHELL AND PERCEPTION OF OUR COR TEMPERATURE IN OTHER WORDS THERE ARE TIMES WHEN OUR BODY TEMPERATURES REALLY HIGH WE HAVE A FEVER AND YET WERE SHIVERING WERE COLD AND THAT'S BECAUSE UNDER CONDITIONS OF FEVER THE IMMUNE SYSTEM LIBERATES CERTAIN MOLECULES THAT IMPACT AND IN SOME WAYS INTENTIONALLY DISRUPT THE PREOPTICARY THE PE AWAY AND THE WAY AT NORMALLY FUNCTIONS SO THAT IT CAN OVERRIDE PURA FURAL SIGNALS AND SIMPLY TRY AND HEAT THE BODY AND KILL WHATEVER PATHAGE IN HAS INFECTED THE BODY SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT THINK ABOUT FEVER IS ALWAYS A BAD THING IT'S NOT NOW OF COURSE WE DON'T WANT OUR CORBODY TEMPERATURE TO GO SO HIGH THAT TISSUES OF THE BRAIN ABODY OR DAMAGE THIS IS ONE REASON WHY IF A FEVER EVER GOES YOU KOW ABOVE A HUNDR AND THREE YOU NEED THO START GETTING A LIWL BIT WORRIED HUNDR AND FORE YOU KNOW THERE ARE TIMES WHEN YOU NEED TO CALL AN AMBULANCE TO GO TO HOSPITAL YOUREALLEAN TO EMPLOY COOLING M ETHODS OF THE SORT THAT I TALKED ABOUT BEFORE TO PREVENT HYPEROTHERMIA COURSE SAFE RANGES FOR BODY TEMPRATURE VERY BETWEEN INFANTS AND ADULTS WE CAN LOOK THOSE UP ON LINE DEPENDING ON THE PERSONS AGE WHAT IS A SAFE RANGE WHAT IS NOT BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT IF YOUARE TAKING COMPOUNDS PILLS TO REDUCE YOUR FEVER YOU ARE ACTUALLY SHORT CIRCUITING THE PROTECTIVE MECHANISM FOR BURNING UP THE PATHAGEAN AND THAT'S BECAUSE MOST PATHAGINS BACTERIAN VIRISES DON'T SURVIVE WELL AT HIGH TEMPERATURES IN FACT IN LABORATORIES IF WE WANT TO PRESERVE OF IRIS FOR USE WE PUT IT INTO A FREEZER IF WE WANT TO KILL A VIRIS WE WANT WE HEAT INOCULATE IT SO IN MANY WAYS FEVER IS YOUR NATURAL FORM OF HEAT AND OCULATION DESIGN TO KILL PATHAGES OF VARIOUS KINDS NOW LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST I WANT A REFERED TO THE STUDY THAT I DESCRIBED AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS EPISODE INVOLVING WHAT'S CALLED LOCAL HYPEROTHERMIA IN ORDER TO TRIGGER A NUMBER OF BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN FAT TISSUE IN ORDER TO CONVERT WHITE FAT TO BASE FAT WHICH IS THE METABOLICALLY ACTIVE FORM OF FAT MANY OF YOU OR AT LEAST SOME OF YOU SHOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE CAN INCREASE BROWN FAT STORES THESE MITOCONDREAL DENTS FAT STORES THAT CAN IN TURN ALLOW A PERSON TO FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IN COLD TEMPERATURES WATER OR OTHERWISE AND INCREASE CORMETABOLISM I TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE EPISODE ON COLD BUT VERY BRIEFLY THE GENERAL PROTOCAL AGAIN IS TO GET ELEVEN MINUTES TOTAL PER WEEK OF UNCOMFORTABLE YET SAFE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE EITHER THROUGH ICE BAT COLDCHOWER COLD IT IMMERGION UP TO THE NECK OR SOME OTHER FORM OF COLD EXPOSURE THAT TRIGGERS INCREASES IN BROWN FAT THAT'S BEEN BEAUTIFULLY SHOWN BY DOCTOR SUSANNA SOBERG AND THAT INCREASE IN BROWN FAT IN TURN INCREASES CORMETABOLISM AND ONE'S ABILITY TO FEEL COMFORTABLE IN COL TEMPERATURES THIS WAS A STUDY DONE IN HUMANS AND THERS NOW AMPLE EVIDENCE FROM ANIMAL MODELS TO SUPPORT THAT THIS IS A GENERAL PHENOMENON I THINK MOST PEOPLE COULD USE IN BENEFIT FROM LOCAL HYPEROTHERMIA IS A DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT PHENOMENON IT INVOLVES HEATING A PARTICULAR SURFACE OF THE BODY AS A WAY TO CONVERT THE WHITE FAT AT THAT LOCATION TO BASE FAT WHICH IN TURN LEADS TO MORE SYSTEMIC INCREASES IN THERMOGENESIS AND INCREASES IN METABOLISM AND BELIEVE ARE NOT IN FAT LOSS NOW THE STUDY THAT IM REFERING TO IS A VERY RECENT STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISH AGAIN IN THIS TERRIFIC APEX JOURNAL CELL SULPRES JOURNAL AND AGAIN ONE OF THE THREE TOP JOURNALS NATURE SCIENCE AN CELL AR R THE THREE TOP JOURNALS TOP BECAUSE THERE THE MOST COMPETIVE BUT ALSO GENERALLY NOT ALWAYS BUT GENERALLY THE MOST STRINGENT IN TERMS OF THE RE VIEW PROCESS PAPERS THAT MAKE IT INTO THESE THREE JOURNALS GENERALLY OF ARE VERY VERY HIGH QUALITY AND CERAINLY ENOUGH PEOPLE SEE THEM THAT IF THEYARE NOT OF HYH QUALITY THEY GET SHOT DOWN PRETTY QUICKLY IND AT A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME WHEREAS PAPERS AND OTHER JOURNALS CAN SOMETIMES LAST A LONG TIME BEFORE THEREEVER REPLICATED ET CETERA THE TITLE OF THIS PAPER IS LOCAL HYPEROTHERMIATHEROPE INDUCES BROWNING OF WHITE FAT AND TREATS OBESITY THIS WAS A STUDY THAT WAS PERFORMED ON MICE END HUMANS IN THE SAME STUDY WHAT THE STUDY INVOLVED WAS HEATING OF A LOCAL PATCH OF SKIN TO FORTY ONE DEGREE SELSIUS WHICH IS A HUNDRED AND FIVE POINT EIGHT DEGREES FERENHEITE BUT NOT DAMAGING THE SKIN OCISE SO THEY THE METHODS OF HEATING DID NOT INVOLVED PLACING SOMETHING ON THE SKIN THAT WOULD DAMAGE IT IN FACT IN THE STUDY ON THE MICE THEY USE THIS AND AV CLEVER MOLECULAR OM CHCANERY IN ORDER TO DO IT AND IN HUMANS THEY USED A THERMOCOUPLE THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO HEAT THE SKIN UP A JUST LOCALLY IN PARTICULAR LOCATIONS ON THE BODY THEYU'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT THEY REFERRED TO THIS PROCESS AS ELL H T OR LOCAL HEAT FERAPY THE REASON THEY DID THIS IS WORTH CONSIDERING IT'S LONG BEEN KNOWN FROM CLINICAL DATA END IN FACT FROM BIT OF RESEARCH DATA THAT PEOPLE THAT EXPERIENCE BURN ON A SMALL OR UNFORTUNATELY IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR BODY EXPERIENCE OVER ALL DECREASES IN BODY FAT AND INCREASES IN METABOLISM THAT CAN LAST MANY YEARS NOW OF COURSE IS NOT REASONABLE NOR WOULD ONE EVER WANT TO INDUCE BURN IN ORDER TO INDUCE FAT LOSS BUT THE OBSERVED INCREASES IN METABOLISM AND FAT LOSS IN RESPONSE TO SKIN SURFACE BURN COULDN'T BE EXPLAIN BY REDUCTIONS IN ACTIVITY RELATED TO THE BURN FOR INSTANCE END IN FACT THERE ARE MOLECULAR PATHWAYS RELATED TO SOMETHING CALLED U C P ONE WHICH IS UNCOUPLING PROTINE ONE I TALKED ABOUT THIS ALSO IN THE COLD EPISODE BUT DON'T WORRY IF YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT EPISODE IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO U C P ONE HAS THE ABILITY TO INCREASE MIGHT A CONDRIAL FUNCTION IN WAYS THET INCREASED COR BODY TEMPERATURE OVER ALL IN PARTICULAR IN BAGE AND BROWN FAT WHICH ARE THESE FAT CELLS THAT EXIST GENERALLY ALONG OUR SPINE AND IN PARTICULAR IN THE UPPER PART OF OUR BACK AND AROUND OUR NECK AND CLAVICALS AND THEIR RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTING AS AS SORT OF A A CANDLE ER I SHOULD SAY THE THE FUEL OR THE FAT OF A CANDLE THAT CAN BE BURNED UP TO MANUFACTURE HEAT IN THE BODY SO IF YOU NORMALLY THINK ABOUT FAT ANYTHING ABOUT BLUBBERY FAT YOURE THINKING ABOUT WHITE FAT WHICH AGAIN IS JUST A STORG SIGHT BASE FAT AND BROWN FAT EXISTED JUST A FEW LOCATIONS MAINLY INTERNALLY AROUND OUR SPINAL CORD AND ARE CLAVICALS AND THOSE FAT STORES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR GENERATING HEAT IN OUR BODY SO THEYR VERY METABOLICALLY ACTIVE FORM OF FAT SMALL CHILDREN HAVE A LOT OF BROWN FAT AND BAGE FAT IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE VERY YOUNG CHILDREN CAN'T SHIVER NOMBER OF YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW THAT BUT VERY YOUNG CHILDREN CAN'T SHIVERS OF THEY NEED SOME WAY TO GENERATE HEAT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY STAY ALIVE IF THEY WERE EVER TO GET COLD THIS IS ALSO PROBABLY THE REASON WHY LOCATES CAN RUN AROUND ON A COLD DAY OUTSIDE WITHOUT THEIR SHURT ON AND THE ONLY EVEN SEEM IN OTICE RE ASIDULTS OR FREEZING COLD AS WE GET OLDER THE AMOUNT OF BASIAN BROWN FAT TENDS TO EITHER REDUCE OR SHRINK OR DISAPPEAR ENTIRELY IT STILL DEBATE D WHICH HAPPEN S BUT WE KNOW THAT WHITE FAT CAN BE CONVERTED TO THIS MORE METABOLICALLY ACTIVE FORM OF BASH FAT BY DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE ACCORDING TO THE PROTOCAL I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER AND NOW IT SEEMS BASED ON THIS NEW STUDY THAT LOCAL HEATING OF SKIN TISSUE CAN ALSO INDUCE U C P ONE AND THE EFFECTS OF U C P ONE ON INCREASING METOCONDRA AND IN FACT THAT LOCAL HYPERTHERMIA FORTY ONE DEGRE CELCIUS THAT IS HUNDRAND FIVE POINT EIGHT DEGREES FERENHEITE CAN ACTUALLY INDUCE THE CONVERSION OF WHITE FAT TO BASH FAT NOW THAT'S PRETTY INTERESTING AND I CAN ALREADY PREDICT THE WAY THIS IS PROBABLY INNEGO IN THE CAN A WELLNESS AND BILEHACKING IN LONGEVITY COMMUNITIES I'M SURE THAT PRETTY SOON THE ARE GONG TO BE PEOPLE PUTTING HEATING PADS ON DIFFERENT FAT PADS OF THEIRS ON THEIR BODY TRYING TO REDUCE OR AT LEAST CONVERT THE WHITE FAT IN TE BH FAT AND WHO KNOWS MAY BE THATTLE WORK THERE HAVE NOT BEEN MANY CONTROLLED STUDIES OF THIS YET THIS IS THE FIRST AT LEAST TO MY KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH STUDIES LOOKING AT THIS IN NON BURN CONDITIONS NONE THE LESS THE DATA ARE MECHANISTICALLY EVEN MORE INTERESTING THAN THIS WHOLE BUSINESS ABOUT U C P ONE AND HERS WHY LOCAL HYPEROTHERMIA USING THE PROTOCAL THAT I DESCRIBED BEFORE RESULTED IN THE INCREASE OF A PROMOTER WHICH IS A ESSENTIALLY A MECHANISM BY WHICH CERTAIN GENES REGULATE THEIR ACTIVITY THIS IS A D IN A BINDING OF SOMETHING CALLED H S F ONE WE DON'T HAVE TO GO TO DEEP IN THE MECHANISM HERE OR THE NOMIN CLATURE BUT H S F STANDS FOR H SHOCK FACTOR ONE AN H S F ONE BINDING TO A PARTICULAR LOCATION IN THE GENO ALOWED FOR A DIFFERENT MOLECULE WITH A VERY LONG NAME I'L JUST TELL IT TO FOR FON BUT YOU CAN JUST LET THE NUMBERS AND LETTERS STREAM BIDES NOT IMPORTANT H ND ARE N P A TO B ONE SHORTEN TO A TO B ONE WHICH FRANKLY IS NOT THAT SHORT TO BEGIN WITH  TO B ONE ISTILL A NAME THAT SHOULD BE MEANING LEST TO MOST EVERYBODY BUT HEARS WHAT'S REALLY COOL  TO B ONE IS DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN GLUCOS AND LIPID METABOLISM AND REGULATES THE GENES THAT CONTROL GLUCOS AND LIPID METABOLISM SO HERE WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE LOCAL HEATING OF SKIN CONVERTED A METABOLICALLY SLUGGISH OR INACTIVE SCELTYPE THE WHITE FAT CELL IN TO THE METABOLICALLY CHARGING SO TO SPEAK BSH FAT CELL WHICH IN TURN LED TO SYSTEMIC MEANING BODY WIDE INCREASES IN METABOLISM THROUGH TWO MECHANISM ONE MECHANISM IS THIS INCREAS IN U C P ONE WHICH FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT WAN TO KNOW U C P ONE CAUSES SHIFTS IN THE WAY THAT POTENTIAL ENERGY IS PUSHED FROM THE PROTONS THROUGH THE MITOCONDRAPASILY MORE METICONDRUAL FUNCTION WHICH MEANS MORE A T P WHICH MEAN SELLS A MORE ACTIVE A C A INCREASE METABOLISM END INCREASES IN THINGS LIKE  CHOCK FACTOR ONE AND  TO B ONE WHICH ARE INVOLVED IN LIPID IN GLUCOS METABOLISM AN REGULATION SO I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THIS STUDY DOES NOT SAY THAT SPOT REDUCTION IS P OSSIBLE WITH LOCAL HEATING OF TISSUE I JUST CONCEEVE IT NOW THAT ONCE THIS PAPER GETS OUT INTO THE PRESS PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY OH HEATING UP A CERTAIN PATCH OF SKIN IS GOIN TO BURN FAT OR CONVERT FAT TO SOME OTHER SELTYPE AT THAT LOCATION SORRY THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT WORKS THEY DID OBSERVE INCREASES IN BAGE FAT CELLS AT CERTAIN LOCATIONS IN THE BODY BUT THOSE INCREASES IN BAGE FAT OCCURRED WHERE BAE FAT SELLS ALWAYS RESIDE AROUND THE SPINE THE UPPER NECK THE CLAPVICALS AND SO ON THIS IS EXCITING BECAUSE IT PROVIDES YET ANOTHER POTENTIAL MECHANISM IN ADDITION TO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE TO INCREASE BAGE FAT MEANING THE METABOLICALLY ACTIVE FORM OF FAT SEL IT ALSO NICELY PROVIDES A MECHANISM RE AT LEAST A POTENTIAL MECHANISM FOR THE OBSERVATION THAT BURN EITHER SMALL PATCH OF SKIN BEING BURNED OR AGAIN SADLY LARGE PATCHES OF SKIN BEING BURNED LEADING TO THESE VERY EXTREME AND VERY LONG LASTING INCREASES IN BODY FAT LOSS AND METABOLISM WHAT IF ANYTHING SHOULD YOU DO WITH THIS INFORMATION WHILE FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO VERY MUCH CAUTION PEOPLE ABOUT PUTTING ANYTHING SO HOT THAT IT CAN DAMAGE THE SURFACE OF YOUR SKIN ON TO YOUR SKIN THAT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE IDEA HOWEVER I DO PREDICT TO TIME NOT TOO FAR FROM NOW WHERE PEOPLE WILL START TO EXPLORE THE USE OF LOCAL SKIN HEATING AS A MEANS TO INCREASE THE CONVERSION OF WHITE DEBAGE FAT AND IN TURN FOR BAGE FAT STORES TO INCREASE METABOLISM OVER ALL AND MAYBE EVEN IMPROVE LUCOS METABOLISM AND THERMAGENISIS IF YOU LIKE MORE DETAILS ABOUT THIS STUDY WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO IT IN THE SHOWNOTES CAPTION I SHOULD MENTION THAT THE STUDY LEAST THE PORTION OF THE STUDY THAT WAS FOCASED ON HUMANS INVOLVED ROUGHLY EQUAL NUMBERS OF MALES AND FEMALES THE SUBJECTS FOLLOWED THEIR NORMAL DAILY SCHEDUAL INCLUDING TIME AND COMPOSITION MEALS THEY SAY IREST IN ACTIVE HOURS ET CETER ET CETERA THE LOCAL HYPROTHERMIATHERAPY WAS DONE IN THE FOLLOWING WAY HERE ON PERAPHRASING FROM THEIR METHOD SECTION THE SUBJECTS WERE SEETED AN UPRIGHT POSTURE THEY WERE WARING A STANDARD TEST ROBE WITH THE HEAD AND NECK AND SHOULDERS UNCLOTHED AND ONE METER AWAY FROM A THERMAL IMAGING CAMERA WHICH COULD BASILY MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE AT THEIR SKIN SURFACE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT REMAINED CONSTANT ACROSS SUBJECTS AND YET SAFE THE SUPERCLAVICULER FAT DEPOSITS MEANING THE UPPER SHOULDERS AND UPPER BACK AREA WERE EXPOSED TO THIS THERMAL SOURCE AGAIN FORTY ONE DEGREES FOR TWENTY MINUTES SO AS FORTY ONE EGREES FOR TWENTY MINUTES AND THEIR CORTEMPERATURES AND SKIN TEMPERATURES WERE MONITERED BEFORE AND AFTER THIS LOCAL HYPROTHERMIC THERAPY THE SUBJECTS WERE EXPOSED TO THIS LOCAL HYPROTHERMIATHERAPE THREE DAYS PER WEAK SEPARATED BY DAY MONDAY WEDNESDAY AND FHRIDAS THEY AD WEAKENS OFF FOR FIVE WEEKS TOTAL AFTER WHICH THEIR DATA WERE COLLECTED AND THE STUDY HAS A NUMBER OF OTHER REALLY INTERESTING FEATURES THAT ARE SURE TO LEAD TO INCREASED UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH MECHANISM AND NEW PROTOCALS SUCH AS ANALYSIS OF THE GENES AND PROTENES THAT ARE ACTIVATED DOWNSTREAM OF THIS LOCAL HYPROTHERMIATHERAPY I FIND THESE DATE INCREDIBLY INTERESTING IN PART BECAUSE OF THE WAYS THAT LOCAL HYPROTHERMIA THERAPE MIMICS DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE THERAPY SAME DOWNSTREAM MECHANISMS YOU C P ONE AND SOME OF THE OTHER PATHWAYS ARE INVOLVED AND ALL OF THAT POINTS TO A SOMEWHAT NEW BUT CERTAINLY AN IMPORTANT CONCEPT MANY VIEW H PROBABLY HEARD OF HORMESES WHICH IS THE SUBJECTING OF ONESELF OR OTHERS I SUPPOSE TO ANOUGH STRESS TO INDUCE AN ADAPTATION OF SOME KIND SO HORMESUS IS THE REASON WHY IF YOU GET INTO COLD WATER REPEATEDLY AT FIRST IT'S VERY PAINFUL PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND OVERTIME YOU GET USED TO IT YOU NEVERY DAT COMPLETELY AS TO IT WE GET MORE USED TO IT HORMESIS IS ALSO USED TO DESCRIBE THE ADAPTATION TO CARDIOVASCULAR EXERCISE OR TO THE HARD REP SETS OF RESISTANCE TRAINING AND THE GROWTH OF MUSCLES OR THE STRENGTHENING A MUSCLES OR THE IMPROVEMENT ING PARTY OF ASCULAR FUNCTION TOR ENDURANCE EXERCISE AND SO FORTH HORMISIS IS A SOMEWHAT COMMON TERM NOWADAYS IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD IT NOW YOUE HEARD IT IN THIS PAPER THEY DESCRIBE WHAT IS CALLED MITO HOR MESIS WHICH IS IN ESSENCE THE FACT THAT ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STRESSFUL STIMULE PROVIDED THEY ACTIV ATE U C P ONE AND SOME OF THESE OTHER PATHWAYS THAT AVE JUST DESCRIBED LIKE A CHS OF ONE CAN INDUCE CHANGES IN THE MITOCHONDRIA THAT LEAD TO INCREASES IN METABOLISM SO IT SHOULDN'T SURPRISE US THAT COLD AN HEAT CAN BOTH LEAD TO INCREASES IN METABOLISM AND CONVERSION OF WHITE FAT TO BA SHRAT IT SHOULDN'T SURPRISE US BECAUSE BOTH PATHWAYS OR STRESS LOCAL HYPROTHERMIA IS STRESS BURN CERTAINLY IS STRESS SANA IS A FORM OF STRESS DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IS A FORM OF STRESS EXERCISE IS A FORM OF STRESS AND THE ADAPTATION TO THOSE STRESSERS IS NOT INFINITE ALL OF THOSE PROTOCALS ANY PROTOCAL FOR THAT MATTER IS GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO CONVERGE ON IN EXISTING INTERNAL BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM SO THERE IS NO UNIQUE MECHANISM FOR EACH PROTOCAL EACH PROTOCAL THAT HAVE TALKED ABOUT TODAY WHETTHER OTS FIVE MINUTES AR TWENTY MINUTES ARE FOUR TIMES IN A DAY OR THREE TIMES PER WEEK OR SEVENTIMES PER WEEK IS TICKLING OR PUSHING OR STOMPING IF YOU WILL ON A GIVEN PATHWAY IN REALLY ACTIVATING IT TO A MILDER TO SEVERE DEGREE WHAT HAVE TRIED TO DO TO DAY IS TO ILLUSTRATE THE GENERAL MECHANISMS BY WHICH HEAT IN PARTICULAR CAN ACTIVEATE CERTAIN BIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS SO THAT YOU CAN DEVISE PROTOCALS THAT ARE GOING TO BE OPTIMAL FOR YOU IN YOUR NEEDS SUGGJUST A BRIEFLY RECAP IF YOU WANT TO GET THE GREATEST GROWTH HORMON INCREASES DO SANA OR OTHER DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE FAIRLY SELDOM PROBABLY NO MORE THAN ONCE PER WEEK MAY BE EVEN LESS AND DO IT A LOT THAT DAY JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU BREAK IT UP IN TUMULTIPLE SESSIONS AND THE STUDY I DESCRIBED REALLY THEY DID FOR SESSIONS THIRTY MINUTES EACH BUT THAT WAS JUST ONCE A WEEK IF YOUR INCIT IN THE CARDIEOVASCULAR BENEFITS AND THE POTENTIAL LONGEVITY BENEFITS OF SANA WH ELL THEN IT'S CLEAR THAT DOING IT THREE TO FOUR MAY BEVEN SEVEN TIMES PER WEEK IS GOING TO BE MORE BENEFICIAL THAN DOING IT JUST ONE OR THREE TIMES PER WEEP IT STANDS TO REASON THAT FOR THOSE OF YOU INTERESTED IN THE GENERAL HEALTH EFFECTS OF SANA ABOUT AN HOUR PER WEEK BROKEN UP IN THO THREE SESSIONS MAKES THE MOST SENSE PASED ON MY REAT OF THE DATA AND AGAIN THAT RANGE OF EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED DEGREE SELSIUS IS GOING TO BE YOUR GUIDE AND IN TERMS OF THE MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS IT SEEMS THAT GETTING A LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE IN THAT HEAT ENVIRONMENT SONER OTHERWISE PROVIDED T SAFE IS GOING TO BE THE BEST WAY TO ACCESS THOSE MENTAL HEALTH EFFECTS BY WAY OF INCREASING DINORPHEN WHICH AS YOU RECALL WILL THEN INCREASE THE ABILITY OF ENDORPHAN TO HAVE ITS POSIVE EFFECTS ON MOOD AFTER YOU GET OUT OF THE SANA OR OTHER DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE AND IN TERMS OF TIMING AFTER A WORK OUT OF ANY KIND MORNING OR AFTERNOON OR IF YOU'RE NOT DOING IT AFTER A WORK OUT CERTAINLY IN THE LATER PART OF THE DAY IS GOING TO BE MOST BENEFICIAL AS IT RELATES TO SLEEP BUT OF COURSE IS A CAVIAT THERE WHICH I MENTION AGAIN WHICH IS THAT FOR THOSE WHOR YOU HAVE NO TROUBLE SLEEPING CAUSE YOUR EXHAUSTED OR YOUR JUST GOING TO THESE PHENOMENAL SLEEPERS WELL THEN DO IT ANY TIME OF DAY OR NIGHT BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE DOING IT LATER IN THE DAY IS GOING TO BE MORE BENEFICIAL BECAUSE OF THE POST SON A COOLING EFFECT AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COOLING BY A DEGREE OR MORE AS A WAY TO ENTER SLEEP THANK FOR JOINING ME TO DAY FOR MY DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF HEAT AND HEAT TING FOR HEALTH IF YOU ARE LEARNING FROM AND OR ENJOYING THIS PODCAST PLEASE

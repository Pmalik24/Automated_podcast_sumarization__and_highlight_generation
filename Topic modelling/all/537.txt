WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAPOT CAS  O SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TO  MY NAME IS ANDER HUBERMEN AND O PROFESSOR OF NUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FOR MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I WANT A THANK THE FIRST SPONSOR OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS AT LETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASEN I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS ON TH REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGRENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT IT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WIH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS I GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBIICS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREENSTOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'LLGIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENSIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALT EVEN IF WORE GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIEN IN VITEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIVFRE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TODAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIU MAGNESIUM IN POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOES ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOS OF ELECTROLITES IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN ND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THEY'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO T OU ELEMENT ELEMENTY DACAM SLASH HUBERMEN TO DAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NEURL PLASTICITY WHICH IS THIS INCREDIBLE FEATURE OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEMSTHAT ALLOWS IT TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE NERL PLASTICITY IS ARGUABLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF OUR BIOLOGY IT HOLDS THE PROMISE FOR EACH AND ALL OF US TO THINK DIFFERENTLY TO LEARN NEW THINGS TO FORGET PAINFUL EXPERIENCES AND TO ESSENTIALLY ADAPT TO ANYTHING THAT LIFE BRINGS US BY BECOMING BETTER A NERL PLASTICITY HAS A LONG AND IMPORTANT HISCSTRY AND WENE I CAN A REVIEW ALL OF IT IN DETAIL BUT TODAY WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS DISCUSS WHAT IS NERAL PLASTICITY AS WELL AS THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF NERAL PLASTICITY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO ACCESS NEURAL PLASTICITY DEPENDING ON HOW OLD YOU ARE AND DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFIC TYPES OF CHANGES THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE THIS IS A TOPIC FOR WHICH THERE ARE LOTS OF TOOLS AS WELL AS LOTS OF BIOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES THAT WE CAN DISCUSS SO LET'S GET STARTED MOST PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE WORD NEURL PLASTICITY THAT SOMETIMES ALSO CALLED NEURO PLASTICITY THOSE ARE THE SAME THING SO IF I SAY NERL PLASTICITY OR NEURO PLASTICITY I'M REFERRING TO THE SAME PROCESS WHICH IS THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEMS ABILITY TO CHANGE ITSELF THERE LOT OF REASONS WHY THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WOULD DO THIS IT COULD DO IT IN RESPONSE TO SOME TRAMATIC EVENT IT COULD FOR INSTANCE CREATE A SENSE OF FEAR AROUND A PARTICULAR PLACE OR A FEAR OF AUTOMOBILES OR PLANES IT COULD ALSO OCCUR WHEN SOMETHING POSITIVE HAPPENS LIKE THE BIRTH OF OUR FIRST CHILD OR WHEN OUR PUPPY DOES SOMETHING AMUSING OR WE SEE AN INCREDIBLE FEET OF PERFORMANCE IN ATHLETICISM THE WORD NERL PLASTICITY MEANS SO MANY THINGS TO SO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO JUST FIRST PUT A LITTLE BIT OF ORGANIZATIONAL LOGIC AROUND WHAT IT IS AND HOW IT HAPPENS BECAUSE NOWADAYS IF YOU WERE TO GO ON LINE IN GOUGLE THE WORD NEUR PLASTICITY YOU WOULD FIND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF REFERENCES SCIENTIFIC REFERENCES AS WELL AS A LOT OF FALSEHOODS ABOUT WHAT NERL PLASTICITY IS AND HOW TO ACCESS IT THEY MENTION BEFORE WERE CONTALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF IT AND WERE CONTALK ABOUT THE TOOLS THAT ALLOW YOU TO ENGAGE THIS INCREDIBLE FEATURE OF YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THAT'S THE FIRST POINT WHICH IS THAT ALL OF US WERE BORN WITH A NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT ISN'T JUST CAPABLE OF CHANGE BUT WAS DESIGNED TO CHANGE WHEN WE ENTER THE WORLD OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS CRIMED FOR LEARNING THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM OF A BABY IS WIRED VERY CRUDELY THE CONNECTIONS ARE NOT PRECISE AND WE CAN SEE EVIDENCE OF THAT IN THE FACT THAT BABIES ARE KOND OF FLOPPING THERE LIKE A CONTIL POTATO BUG WITH LIMBS THEY CAN'T REALLY DO MUCH IN TERMS OF CORDINATED MOVEMENT THEY CERTAIN LY CAN'T SPEAK AND THEY CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING WITH PRECISION AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE COME INTO THIS WORLD OVER CONNECTED WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY WIRES THOSE WIRES HAVE NAMES LIKE AXONS AND DENDRITES THOSE OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE NURANS DISCUSSED AN EPISODE ONE BUT THOSE LITTLE PARTS AND THOSE WIRES IN CONNECTIONS ARE EVERYWHERE IMAGINE A BUNCH OF ROADS THAT ARE ALL CONNECTED TO ONE ANOTHER IN KIND OF A MESS BUT THERE ARE NO HIGHWAYS THERE ALL JUST SMALL ROADS THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE YOUNG NERVOUS SYSTEM IS LIKE AND THEN AS WE MATURE AS WE GO FROM DAY ONE OF LIFE TO TEN YEARS OLD TWENTY YEARS OLD THIRTY YEARS OLD WHAT HAPPENS IS PARTICULAR CONNECTIONS GHET REINFORCED AND STRONGER AND OTHER CONNECTIONS ARE LOST SO THAT'S THE FIRST IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE THAT I WANT EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND WHICH IS THAT DEVELOP MENTAL PLASTICITY THE NERL PLACSYSTY THAT OCCURS FROM THE TIME WERE BORN UNTIL ABOUT AGE TWENTY FIVE IS MAINLY A PROCESS OF REMOVING CONNECTIONS THAT DON'T SERVE OUR GOLS WELL NOW OF COURSE CERTAIN EVENTS HAPPENED DURING THAT BIRTH TO TWENTY FIVE PERIOD IN WHICH POSITIVE EVENTS AND NEGATIVE VENTS ARE REALLY STAMPED DOWN INTO OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IN A VERY DRAMATIC FACTION BY WHAT WE CALL ONE TRIAL LEARNING WE EXPERIENCE SOMETHING WANTS AND THAT OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS FOR EVER CHANGED BY THAT EXPERIENCE UNLESS OF COURSE WE GO THROUGH SOME WORK TO UNDO THAT EXPERIENCE SO I WANT O YOU TO IMAGINE IN YOUR MIND THAT WHEN YOU WERE BROUGHT INTO THIS WORLD YOU ERE ESSENTIALLY A WIDELY CONNECTED WEB OF CONNECTIONS THAT WAS REALLY POOR AT DOING ANY ONE THING AND THAT THROUGH YOUR EXPERIENCE WHAT YOU WERE EXPOSED TO BY YOUR PARENTS OR OTHER CARETAKERS THROUGH YOUR SOCIAL INTERACTIONS THROUGH YOUR THOUGHTS THROUGH THE LANGUAGES THAT YOU LEARN THROUGH THE PLACES YOU TRAVELED ARED IN TRAVEL YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM BECAME CUSTOMIZED TO YOUR UNIQUE EXPERIENCE NOW THAT'S TRUE FOR CERTAIN PARTS OF YOUR BRAIN THAT ARE INVOLVED IN WHAT WE CALL REPRESENTATIONS OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD A LOT OF YOUR BRAIN IS DESIGN TO REPRESENT THE VISUAL WORLD OR REPRESENT THE AUDITORY WORLD OR REPRESENT THE GALLERY OF SMELLS THAT ARE POSSIBLE IN THE WORLD HOWEVER THERE ARE ASPECTS OF YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT WERE DESINED NOT TO BE PLASTIC THEY WERE WIRED SO THAT PLASTICITY OR CHANGES IN THOSE CIRCUITS IS VERY UNLIKELY THOSE CIRCUITS INCLUDE THINGS LIKE THE ONES THAT CONTROL YOUR HEART BEAT THE ONES THAT CONTROL YOUR BREATHING THE ONES THAT CONTROL YOUR DIGESTION AND THANK GOODNESS THAT THOSE CIRCUITS WERE SET UP THAT WAY BECAUSE YOU WANT THOSE CIRCUITS TO BE EXTREMELY RELIABLE YOU NEVER WANT TO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER NOT YOUR HEART WILL BEAT OR WHETHER NOT YOU WILL CONTINUE BREATHING OR WHETHER NOT YOUWILL BE ABLE TO DIGEST YOUR FOOD SO MANY NERVOU SYSTEM FEATURES LIKE DIGESTION AND BREATHING AND HEART RATE ARE HARD TO CHANGE OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM ARE ACTUALLY QUITE EASY TO CHANGE AND ONE OF THE GREAT GIFTS OF CHILDHOOD ADOLESCENCE AND YOUNG ADULTHOOD IS THAT WE CAN LEARN THROUGH ALMOST PASSIVE EXPERIENCE WE DON'T HAVE TO FOCUSS THAT HARD IN ORDER TO LEARN NEW THINGS IN FACT CHILDREN GO FROM BEING ABLE TO SPEAK NO LANGUAGE WHATSOEVER TO BEING ABLE TO SPEAK MANY MANY WORDS AND COMPRIZE SENTENCES INCLUDING WORDS THEY'VE NEVER HEARD BEFORE WHICH IS REMARKABLE IT MEANS THAT THE PORTIONS OF THE BRAIN INVOLVED IN SPEECH AND LANGUAGE ARE ACTUALLY CRIME TO LEARN AND CREATE NEW COMBINATIONS WHAT THIS TELLS US IS THAT THE YOUNG BRAIN IS A PLASTICITY MACHINE BUT THEN WRITE ABOUT AGE TWENTY FIVE PLUSERMINUS A YEAR TO EVERYTHING CHANGES AFTER AGE TWENTY FIVE OR SO IN ORDER TO GET CHANGES IN OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM WE HAVE TO ENGAGE IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SET OF PROCESSES IN ORDER TO GET THOSE CHANGES TO OCCUR AND FOR THEM MORE IMPORTANTLY TO STICK AROUND AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS VASTLY OVERLOOKED IN THE POPULAR CULTURE DISCUSSION ABOUT NERAL PLASTISSITY PEOPLE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT FIRE TOGETHER WIRE TOGETHER FIRE TOGETHER WIRE TOGETHER IS TRUE IT IS THE STATEMENT OF MY COLLEAGUEAT STAMFORD CARLA SHATS AND IT'S AN ABSOLUTE TRUTH ABOUT THE WAY THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WIRES UP EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT BUT FIRE TOGETHER WIRE TOGETHER DOESN'T APPLY IN THE SAME WAY AFTER AGE TWENTY FIVE AND SO WE HAVE THESE LITTLE MEANS AND THESE LITTLE A QUOTES THAT YOU KNOW CIRCULATE ON THE INTERNET LIKE FIRE TOGETHER WIRE TOGETHER OR THERE'S A FAMOUS QUOTE FROM THE A THE GREATEST NORBILEJIST OF ALL TIME REMONI CO HALL I THINK IT GO SOMETHING LIKE YOU KNOW SHOULD SOMEBODY WISH TO CHANGE THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEM THEY COULD BE THE OS SCULPTOR OF THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEM IN ANY WAY THEY WANT SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THAT SOUNDS GREAT I MEAN WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO CHANGE THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEM ANY WAY THEY WANT BUT WHAT'S LOST IN THOSE STATEMENTS IS HOW TO ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THAT IN ORDAN TO COVER THAT TO DAY BUT PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS CONNECTED VERY BROADLY IN WAYS THAT MAKE IT VERY HARD TO DO ANYTHING WELL FROM BIRTH UNTIL ABOUT AGE TWENTY FIVE THOSE CONNCTIONS GET REFINED MAINLY THROUGH THE REMOVAL OF CONNECTIONS THAT DON'T SERVE US AND THE INCREDIBLE STRENGTHENING OF CONNECTIONS THAT RELATE TO EITHER POWERFUL EXPERIENCES OR THAT ALLOW US TO DO THINGS LIKE WALK AND TALK AND DO MATH ET CETERA AND THEN AFTER AGE TWENTY FIVE IF WE WANT A CHANGE THOSE CONNECTIONS THOSE SUPERHIGHWAYS OF CONECTIVITY WE HAVE TO ENGAGE IN SOME VERY SPECIFIC PROCESSES AN THOSE PROCESSES AS WILL SOON LEARN ARE GATED MEANING YOU CANT JUST DECIDE TO CHANGE YOUR BRAIN YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO THROUGH A SERIES OF STEPS TO CHANGE YOUR INTERNAL STATE IN WAYS THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO CHANGE YOUR BRAIN I JUST WANT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT COSTELLO IS SNORING PARTICULARLY LOUD TO DAY SOME OF YOU SEEM VERY KEEN AT PICKING UP ON HIS SNORING OTHERS OF YOU CAN'T HERE IS SNORING IT'S VERY LOW RUMBLING SOUND AND WHETHER NOT YOU CAN OR YOU CAN'T PROBABLY RELATES TO THE SENSITIVITY OF YOUR HEARING WEREACTHALLY GIN A TALK ABO PERFECT PITCH TO DAY AND RANGE OF AUDITORY DETECTION AND SO IF YOU CAN HEAR COSTELLO'S SNORING A ENJOY IF YOU CAN'T INJOY I WANT TA TALK ABOUT HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM CHANGES WHAT ARE THESE CHANGES MANY OF US HAVE BEEN CAPTIVATED BY THE STORIES IN THE POPULAR PRESS ABOUT THE EDDITION OF NEW NURONS THIS IDEA OH IF YOU GO RUNNING OR YOU EXERCISE YOUR BRAIN ACTUALLY MAKES NE NURONS WELL I MIAT GIVE YOU THE BAD NEWS FIRST WHICH IS THAT AFTER PUBERTY SO AFTER ABOUT AGE FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN THE HUMAN BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM ADDS VERY FEW IF ANY NEW NURONS THE IDEA THAT NEW NURONS COULD BE ADDED TO THE BRAIN IS ONE THAT HAS A RICH HISTORY IN EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE IT'S CLEAR THAT IN RODANTS AND IN SOME NON HUMAN PRIMATES NEW NURONS A PROCESS CALLED NUROGENISIS CAN OCCUR IN AREAS OF THE BRAINS SUCH AS THE ULFACTORY BULL WHICH IS F COURSE INVOLVED IN SMELL AS WELL AS A REGION OF OUR HIPPOCAMPU THE CENTER OF THE BRAINIBALLD THE MEMORY CALLED THE DENTATE GIRIS OF THE HIPPOCAMPAS AND THERE ARE STRONG EVIDENCE THAT NE NURONS CAN BE ADDED TO THOSE STRUCTURES THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPEN IN HUMANS THE EVIDENCE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTROVERSIAL IT'S CLEAR THAT WE CAN ADD NEW NURONSTRALL OUR OL FACTORY BULB IN FACT IF ANY OF YOU OF EVER HAD THE UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE OF BEING HID ON THE HEAD TO HARD THE WIRES CALLED AXONS FROM THOSE ULLFACTORY NURONS THAT LIVE IN YOUR NOSE CAN GET SHEARED OFF BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO PASS THROUGH A BONY PLATE CALLE TE CRIPERFORM PLATE AND THE CRIPERFORM PLATE CAN SHEAR THOSE AXONS AND PEOPLE CAN BECOME WHAT'S CALLED A NOSMIC THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO SMELL BUT OVER TIME THOSE NURONS UNLIKE MOST ALL CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM NURONS CAN GROW THOSE CONNECTIONS BACK AND EVEN RE ESTABLISH NEW NURONS ADDED TO THE AL FACTORY BULB THEY COME FROM ELSEWHERE DEEP IN THE BRAIN AND THEY MIGRATE THROUGH A PATHWAY CALLED THE ROSTRIL MIGRATORY STREAM YOU CAN GUGLETHESE WORDS AND LOOK LOOK UP SOME OF THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THIS IF YOU LIKE TO LEARN MORE SO INDEED THERE AR SOME EVIDENCE THAT THE NURONS RESPONSIBLE FOR SMELL CAN BE REPLACE THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPEN CERTAINLY IN VERY YOUNG INDIVIDUALS FROM BIRTH TILL ABOUT AGE FIFTEEN OR SO WHETHER OR NOT THEIR NEW NURONS ADDED TO THE HIPPOCAMPUS THE MEMORY CENTER OF THE HUMAN BRAIN ISN'T CLEAR MANY YEARS AGO RUSTY GAGES LAB AT THE SALK INSTITUTE DID A REALLY IMPORTANT STUDY LOOKING AT TERMINALLY ILL CANCER PATIENTS AND INJECTING THEM WITH A LABEL A DIE THAT IS INCORPORATED ONLY INTO NEW NURONS AND AFTER THESE PATIENTS DIED THEIR BRAINS WERE HARVESTED THE BRAINS WERE LOOKED AT AND THERE WERE NEW NURONS THERE THERE WAS EVIDENCE FOR NEW NURONS THOSE RESULTS I THINK STAND OVER TIME BUT WHUT WAS NOT REALLY DISCUSSED IN THE POPULAR PRESS DISCUSSION AROUND THOSE PAPERS WAS THAT IT WAS VERY FEW CELLS THAT WERE BEING ADDED AND A NUMBER OF PAPERS HAVE COME ALONG OVER THE YEARS MAINLY FROM LAVS THAT OUSEASEF ALTHOUGH FROM OTHERS AS WELL SHOWING THAT IF THERE ARE NEW NURONS ADDED TO THE ADULT BRAIN IT'S AND INFANTESTIMALLY SMALL NUMBER OF NEW NURONS SO THAT'S THE DEPRESSING PART WE DON'T GET NEW NURONS AFTERWARE BORN WE PRETTY MUCH HAVE THE NURONS THAT OREGAN TO USE OUR ENTIRE LIFE AND YES AS WE GET OLDER AND WE START TO LOSE CERTAIN FUNCTIONS IN OUR BRAIN WE LOSE NURONS BUT ALL IS NOT LOST SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER WAYS IN WHICH NERAL CIRCUITS CAND CREATE NEW CONNECTIONS AND ADD NEW FUNCTIONS INCLUDING NEW MEMORY NEW ABILITIES AND NEW COGNATIVE FUNCTIONS AND THOSE ARE MAINLY THROUGH THE PROCESS OF MAKING CERTAIN CONNECTIONS WHICH OF COURSE ARE THOSE THINGS WE CALL SINNAPSES BETWEEN NURONS MAKING THOSE CONNECTIONS STRONGER SO THERE MORE RELIABLE THEYRE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE AS WELL AS REMOVING CONNECTIONS AND THE REMOVAL OF CONNECTIONS IS VITAL TO SAY MOING THROUGH A GRIEVING PROCESS OR REMOVING THE EMOTIONAL LOAD OF A TRAMATIC EXPRAINS SO EVEN THOUGH WE CAN ADD NEW NURONS THROUGHOUT OUR LIFE SPAN AT LEAST NOT IN VERY GREAT NUMBERS IT'S CLEAR THAT WE CAN CHANGE OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS AVAILABLE FOR CHANGE THAT IF WE CREATE THE RIGHT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN OUR BRAIN CHEMICAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND IF WE CREATE THE INVIRONMENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND US OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM WILL SHIFT INTO A MODE IN WHICH CHANGE ISN'T JUST POSSIBLE BUT IT'S PROBABLE AS I MENTION BEFORE THE WHOLL MARK OF THE CHILD NERVOUS SYSTEM IS CHANGE IT WANTS TO CHANGE THE WHOLE THING EVERYTHING FROM THE CHEMICALS THAT ARE SSLASHING AROUND AN THERE TO THE FACT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF SPACE BETWEEN THE NURONS LO PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS BUT EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT TEIS LOT OF SPACE BETWEEN THE NURONS INC O THE NURONS CAN LITERALLY MOVE AROUND AND SAMPLE DIFFERENT CONNECTIONS VERY EASILY REMOVING SOM AND KEEPING OTHERS AS WE GET OLDER THE SO CALLED EXTRACELLER SPACE IS ACTUALLY FILLED UP BY THINGS CALLED EXTRACELLER MATRICS AND GLEAL CELLS GLEA MEANS GLUE THOSE CELLS ARE INVOLVED IN A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PROCESSES BUT THEY SART TO FILL IN ALL THE SPACE CONELIKE POURING CONCRETE BETWEEN ROCKS AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT BECOMES MUCH HARDER TO CHANGE THE CONNECTIONS THAT ARE THERE ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN ALL GET PLASTICITY AT ANY STAGE THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPAN IS THROUGH DEFISITS AND EMPARMENTS IN WHAT WE CALL OUR CENSORY APPARATIA EYES OUR EARS OUR NOSE OUR MOUTH AND THERE ARE SOME VERY DRAMATIC AND SOMEWHAT TRAGIC EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE FOR INSTANCE WHO HAVE GENATIC MUTATIONS WHERE THEY ARE BORN WITHOUT A NOSE AND WITHOUT ANY OL FACTORY STRUCTURES IN THE BRAINS O THEY CANNOT SMELL IN THAT CASE AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT NORMALLY WOULD REPRESENT SMELL BECOME OVERTAKEN BY AREAS OF THE BRAIN INVOLVED ANOTHER THINGS LIKE TOUCHINS AND HEARING IN SIGHT IN INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE BLIND FROM BIRTH THE SO CALLED OCCIPITAL QUARTECS THE VISUAL QUARTEX IN THE BACK BECOMES OVERTAKEN BYD HEARING THE NERANS THERE WILL START TO RESPOND TO SOUNDS AS WELL AS BRAIL TOUCH ANISHALLY THERE'S A ONE PARTICULARLY TRAGIC INCIDENT WHERE A WOMAN WHO WAS BLIND SINCE BIRTH AND BECAUSE OF NEROIMAGING STUDIES WE KNEW HER VISUAL QUARTECS WAS NO LONGER VISUAL AS RESPONSIBLE FOR BRAIL READING AND FOR HEARING SHE HAD A STROKE THAT ACTUALLY TOOK OUT MOST OF THE FUNCTION OF HER VISUAL QUARTEC SO THEN SHE WAS BLIND SHE COULDN'T BRAIL READ OR HERE SHE DID RECOVER SOME ASPECT OF FUNCTION NOW MOST PEOPLE THEY DON'T END UP IN THAT HIGHLY UNFORTUNATE SITUATION AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT FOR INSTANCE BLIND PEOPLE WHO USE THEIR VISUAL QUARTECS FOR BRAIL READING AND FOR HEARING HAVE MUCH BETTER AUDITORYACUITY AND TOUCH ACUTI MEANING THEY CAN SENSE THINGS WITH THEIR FINGERS HAND THEY CAN SENSE THINGS WITH THER HEARING THAT TYPICAL SITED FOLKS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO IN FACT YOU WILL FIND A MUCH GREATER INCIDENTS OF PERFECT PITCH IN PEOPLE THAT ARE BLIND AND THAT TELLS US THAT THE BRAIN AND IN PARTICULAR THIS AREA WE CALL THE NEOL QUARTEC WHICH IS THE OUTER PART IS REALLY DESIND TO BE A MAP OF OUR OWN INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE SO THESE WHAT I CALL EXPERIMENTS OF OF EMPARMENT OR LOSS WHERE SOMEBODY IS BLIND FROM BIRTH OR DEAF FROM BIRTH OR A MAYBE HAS A A LIM A DEVELOPMENT EMPAIRMENT WHERE THEY HEY HAVE A STUMP INSTEAD OF AN ENTIRE LIMB WITH IT WITH A FUNCTIONING HAND THEIR BRAIN WILL REPRESENT THE BODY PLAN THAT THEY HAVE NOT SOME OTHER BODY PLAN BUT THE BEAUTY OF THE SITUATION IS THAT THE REAL ESTATE UP IN THE SKULL THAT NEAL QUARTEC THE ESSENCE OF IT IS TO BE ACCUSTOMIZED MAP OF EXPERIENCE NOW IT IS TRUE HOWEVER THAT IF LET'S AY I WERE TO BE BLIND WHEN I'M FIFTY AN FORTY FIVE RIGHT NOW IAVE ALWAYS BEEN CITED IF I WAS BLIND AT FIFTY I' PROBABLY HAVE LESS OPPORTUNITY TO USE MY FORMERLY VISUAL QUARTEC FOR THINGS LIKE BRAIL READING IND HEARING BECAUSE MY BRAIN HAS CHANGED IS UST NOT THE SAME BRAIN I HAD WHEN I WAS A BABY SO THERE'S ACTUALLY A PRINCIPLE OF BIOLOGY NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW THIS IT'S A ESHA PRINCIPLE NEUROLOGY WHICH IS CALLED THE KENERD PRINCIPLE WHICH SAYS IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BRAIN INJURY YOU WANT TO HAVE IT EARLY IN LIFE OF COURSE BETTER DO NOT HAVE A BRAIN INJURY AT ALL BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE IT YOU WANT TO HAVE IT EARLY IN LIFE AND THIS IS BASED ON A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS EXAMINING THE AMOUNT OF RECOVERY AND THE RAT OF RECOVERY IN HUMANS THAT HAD LESIONS TO THEIR BRAIN EITHER EARLY IN LIFE OR LATER IN LIFE SO THE KENERD PRINCIPLE SAYS BETTER TO HAVE INJURIES EARLY IN LIFE NOW THAT'S REASSURING FOR THE YOUNG FOLKS IT'S NOT SO REASSURING FOR THE OLDER FOLKS BUT THERE OUR ASPECTS OF NERL PLASTOSY THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH EMPAIRMENTS MEAN EARLIER I SAID WE'RE ALL WALKING AROUND WITH THIS MAP THIS REPRESENTATION OF THE WORLD AROUND US WE CAN SEE EDGEIS WE CAN SEE COLORS EXCEPT FOR FOLKS ER COLOUR BLIND FOR OF COURSE AND WE ALSO HAVE A MAP OF EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE WE HAVE A MAP OF WHEATHER R NOT CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE TRUSTWORTHY SOME PEOPLE AREN'T TRUSTWORTHY A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS AT A OF COURSE AND A WOMAN CAME UP TO ME AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW I I JUST HAVE I WASN'T TEACHING THE COURSE I WAS IN THE COURSE AND SHE SAID I JUST HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT EVERY TIME YOU SPEAK IT REALLY STRESSES ME OUT AND I SAID WELL HEARD THAT BEFORE BUT IM YOU WANT TO BE MORE SPECIFIC AND SHE SAID YET YOUR TONE OF VOICE REMINDS ME OF SOMEBODY THAT I I HAD A REALLY TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH I SAID WELL KIW I CAN'T CHANGE MY VOICE BY REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND ALSO WILL HELP IM EXPLAIN WHY YOU YOU KNOWN'T SEEM TO CRINGE EVERY TIME I SPEAK WHICH I HADN'T NOTICE UNTIL THEN BUT I AFTER THAT I DID NOTICE SHE HAD A VERY IMMEDIAT N KIND OF VICERAL RESPONSE TO MY SPEECH PERHAPS SOME OF YOUR HAVING THAT RIGHT NOW BUT IN ANY EVENT OVER THE PERIOD OF THIS TOO WEAK COURSE SHE WOULD COME BACK EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE AND SAY YOU KNOWHAT I THINK JUST BY TELLING YOU THAT YOUR VOICE WAS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO LISTEN TO IT'S ACTUALLY BECOMING MORE TOLERABLE TO ME AND BY THE END WE ACTUALLY BECAME PRETTY GOOD FRIENDS AND WERE STILL IN TOUCH AND SO WHAT THIS SAYS IS THAT THE RECOGNITION OF SOMETHING WHETHER NOT THAT'S AN EMOTIONAL THING OR DESIRE TO LEARN SOMETHING ELSE IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST STEP IN NEUR OLE PLASTICITY AND THAT'S BECAUSE OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM HAS TWO BROAD SETS OF FUNCTIONS SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ARE ARE REFLECTIVE THINGS LIKE OUR BREATHING OUR HEARTRIGHT ARE OBVIOUS ONES BUT OTHER ASPECTS OUR REFLECTIVE LIKE OUR ABILITY TO WALK IF I GET UP OUTOF THIS CHAIR AND WALK OUT OF THE DOOR I DON'T THINK ABOUT EACH STEP THAT I'M TAKING AND THAT'S BECAUSE I LEARNED HOW TO WALK DURING DEVELOPMENT BUT WHEN WE DECIDE THAT WE'RE GOING TO SHIFT SOME SORT OF BEHAVIOR OR SOME REACTION OR SOME NEW PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT WE WANT TO LEARN IS SOMETHIN THAT WE WANT TO BRING INT OUR CONSCIOUSNESS THAT AWARENESS IS A REMARKABLE THING BECAUSE IT CUSE THE BRAIN AND THE REST OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT WHEN WE ENGAGE IN THOSE REFLECTSIVE ACTIONS GOING FORWARD THAT THOSE REFLECTS IVE ACTIONS ARE NO LONGER FADED TO BE REFLECTIVE NOW IF THE SOUNDS A LILE BIT ABSTRECT WERE GING TO TALK ABOUT PROTOCALS FOR HOW TO DO THIS BUT THE FIRST STEP IN NERL PLASTICITY IS RECOGNIZING THAT YOU WANT A CHANGE SOMETHING AND YOU SHOULD IMMEDIATELY SAY WHAL KIDSDON'T GO IN TO SCHOOL AND SAY OH I WANT TO LEARN LANGUAGE OR I WANT TO LEARN SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF CHILDHOOD THE WHOLE BRAIN HAS THIS SWITCH FLIT THAT IS MAKING CHANGE POSSIBLE BUT AFTER THAT WE HAVE TO BE DELIBERATE WE HAVE TO KNOW WHAT IT IS EXACTLY THAT WE WANT TO CHANGE OR IF WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THAT WE WANT TO CHANGE WE AT LEAST HAPE TO KNOW THAT WE WANT TO CHANGE SOMETHING ABOUT SOME SPECIFIC EXPERIENCE IN THIS CASE I BELIEVE THAT SHE CAME AND TOLD ME THAT MY VOICE WAS REALLY AWFUL FOR HER TO LISTEN TO NOT TO MAKE ME FEEL BAD OR FOR ANY OTHER REASON EXCEPT THAT SHE WANTED IT TDID NOT BE THE CASE AND SHE KNOW I WAS AGAIN STOP TALKING SO SHE DECIDED TO CALL IT TO HER CONSCIOUSNESS IN MINE AS WELL SO THAT'S IMPORTANT IF YOU WANT TA LEARN SOMETH NG OR YOU WANT A CHANGE YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IN ANY WAY WHETHER NOT BECAUSEOF SOME EMPARMENT ORE BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO ACQHUIRE A COGNIVE SKILL A MOTOR SKILL AN EMOTIONAL SKILL THE FIRST THING IS RECOGNIZING WHAT THAT THING IS AND THAT OFTENG CAN BE THE HARDEST THING TO IDENTIFY BUT THE BRAIN HAS THE SELF RECOGNITION MECHANISMS AND THOSE SELF RECOGNITION MECHANISMS ARE NOT VAGUE A SPIRITUAL OR MISTICAL OR EVEN PSYCHOLOGICAL CONCEPTS THEY ARE NERL CHEMICALS WE'RE GIN A TALK NEXT ABOUT THE NERL CHEMICALS THAT STAMP DOWN PARTICULAR BEHAVIORS AND THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONAL PATTERNS AND TELL THE REST OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THIS IS SOMETHING TO PAY ATTENTION TO BECAUSE THIS IS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CHANGE THAT I WANT TO MAKE SOL REPEAT THAT THERE ARE SPECIFIC CHEMICALS THAT WHEN WE ARE CONSCIOUSLY AWARE OF A CHANGE WE WANT TO MAKE OR EVEN JUST THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SOME CHANGE CHEMICALS ARE RELEASED IN THE BRAIN THAT ALLOW US THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES NOW THEIR SPECIFIC PROTOCALS THAT SCIENCE TELLS US WE HAVE TO FOLLOW IF WE WANT THOSE CHANGES TO OCCUR BUT THAT SELF RECOGNITION IS NOT A KIND OF MIRKY CONCEPT WHAT IT IS IS ITS OUR FOREBRAIN IN PARTICULAR PREFRONT AL QUARTEX SIGNALING THE REST OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT SOMETHING THAT WERE ABOUT TO DO HER FEEL OR EXPERIENCE IS WORTH PAYING ATTENTION TO SO WILL PAUSE THERE AND THEN OMONY MOVE FORWARD ONE OF THE BIGEST LIES IN THE UNIVERSE THAT SEEMS QUITE PROMINENT RIGHT NOWN IS THAT EVERY EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE CHANGES YOUR BRAIN PEOPLE LOVE TO SAY THIS THEY LOVE TO SAY YOUR BRAIN IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT AFTER THIS LECTURER THT YOUR BRAIN IS GON BE DIFFERENT AFTER TO DAY'S CLASS THAN IT WAS TWO DAYS AGO AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM DOESN'T JUST CHANGE BECAUSE YOU EXPERIENCE SOMETHING UNLESS YOU'RE A VERY YOUNG CHILD THE NERVOUS SYSTEM CHANGES WHEN CERTAIN NERO CHEMICALS ARE RELEASED AND ALLOW WHATEVER NEURONS ARE ACTIVE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THOSE CHEMICALS ARE SWIMMING AROUND TO STRENGTHEN OR WEAKEN THE CONNECTIONS OF THOSE NURANS OW THIS IS BEST ILLUSTRATED THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF SCIENTIFIC HISTORY THE WHOLE BASIS OF NER PLAS TO SEE IS ESSENTIALLY ASCRIBED TO TWO INDIVIDUALS ALTHAT THERE WERE LOT MORE PEOPLE THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THIS WORK THOSE TWO INDIVIDUALS GO BY THE NAME DAVID HUBAL AND TORNSTON WEASAL DAVID HUBON TORRENS ON WEASAL STARTED OFF AT JOHN'S TOPKINS MOVED A HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL AND IN THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES THEY DID A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS RECORDING ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN THEY WERE IN THE VISUAL QUARTECS MEANING THEY PUT THE ELECTRODES IN THE VISUAL QUARTEC AND THEY WERE EXPLORING HOW VISION WORKS AND HOW THE VISUAL BRAIN ORGANIZES ALL THE FEATURES OF THE VISUAL WORLD TO GIVE US THESE INCREDIBLE THINGS WE CALL VISUAL PERCEPTIONS BUT HUBAL WAS A PHYSICIAN AND HE WAS VERY INTERESTED IN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN FOR INSTANCE A CHILD COMES INTO THE WORLD AND THEY HAVE A CATARACT THE LENS OF THEIR EYE ISN'T CLEAR BUT ITS OPAQUE OR WHEN A KID HAS A LAZY EYE OR THE EYES HAVE WHAT S CALLED STRIBISMESS WHICH IS WHEN THE EYES EYE THER DEVIATE OUTWARD OR INWARD THESE ARE VERY COMMON THINGS OF CHILDHOOD SPECIALLY IN PARTICULAR AIRS OF THE WORLD AND WHAT DAVID IN TORRENSTON DID IS THEY FIGURED OUT THAT THERE WAS A CRITICAL PERIOD IN WHICH IF CLEAR VISION DID NOT OCCUR THE VISUAL BRAIN WOULD COMPLETELY REWIRE ITSELF BASICALLY TO REPRESENT WHATEVER BID OF VISUAL INFORMATION WAS COMING IN SO THEY DID THESE EXPERIMENTS THE KIND OF SIMULATE A DROOPY EYE OR A DEVIATING EYE WHERETHEY WOULD CLOSE ONE EYELID AND THEN WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT THE VISUAL BRAIN WOULD RESPOND ENTIRELY TO THE OPEN EYE THER SORT OF A TAKE OVER OF THE VISUAL BRAIN REPRESENTING THE OPEN EYE MANY EXPERIMENTS IN MANY DIFFERENT CENSORY SYSTEMS FOLLOWED UP ON THIS THEIR BEAUTIFUL EXPERIMENTS FOR INSTANCE FROM GREG RECKONZONES LAB UP BUT YOU SEE DAVIS AND MAKMERZONIX LABS IT YOU SEE US OF SHOWING THAT FOR INSTANCE IF TWO FINGERS WERE TAPE TOGETHER EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT SO THEY WEREN'T MOVING INDEPENDENTLY THE REPRESENTATION OF THOSE TWO FINGERS WOULD BECOME FUSED IN THE BRAIN SO THAT THE PERSON COULDN'T ACTUALLY DISTINGUISH THE MOVEMENTS AND THE SENSATIONS OF THE TWO FINGERS SEPARATELY PRETTY REMARKABLE ALL OF THIS IS TO SAY THAT DAVID AND TORNSON'S WORK FOR WHICH THEY WANT TO NOABOUL PRIZE THEY SHORED IT WITH ROGERS SPERRY THEIR WORK SHOWED THAT THE BRAIN IS IN FACT A CUSTOMIZED MAP OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD WE SAID THAT ALREADY BUT THAT WHAT ITS DOING IS ITS MEASURING THE AMOUNT OF ACTIVITY FOR A GIVEN PART OF OUR BODY ONE EYE OR THE OTHER OR OUR FINGERS THIS FINGER OR THAT FINGER AND ALL OF THOSE INPUTS ARE COMPETING FOR SPACE IN THE BRAIN NOW THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT IF WE ARE TO CHANGE OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IN ADULTHOOD WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT NOT JUST WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET BUT WHAT WERE TRYING TO GIVE UP WE CAN'T ACTUALLY ADD NEW CONNECTIONS WITHOUT REMOVING SOMETHING ELSE THAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE KIND OF A STINGER BUT IT ACTULLY TURNS OUT TO BE A GREAT ADVANTAGE ONE OF THE KEY EXPERIMENTS THAT DAVID IN TORNSTON DID WHAS AN EXPERIMENT WHERE THEY CLOSED BOTH EYES WHERE THEY ESSENTIALL REMOVED ALL VISUAL IMPUT EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT NOW THIS IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERN THAN BLINDNESS BECAUSE IT WAS TRANSIENT IT WAS ONLY FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BUT WHA THEY FOUND IS WHEN THEY DID THAT THERE WAS NO CHANGE HOWEVER THEY CLOSED JUST ONE EYE THERE WAS A HUGE CHANGE SO WHEN PEOPLE TELL YOU OH AT THE END OF TO DAY'S LECTURE AT THE END OF SOMETHING YOUR BRAIN IS CAN BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAT SIMPLY NOT TRUE IF YOUARE OLDER THAN TWENTY FIVE YOUR BRAIN WILL NOT CHANGE UNLESS THEREIS A SELECTIVE SHIFT IN YOUR ATTENTION OR A SELECTIVE SHIFT IN YOUR EXPERIENCE THAT TELLS THE BRAIN IT'S TIME TO CHANGE AND THOSE CHANGES OCCUR THROUGH THE WAYS I TALKED ABOUT BEFORE STRENGTHENING AND WE ING OF PARTICULAR CONNECTIONS THEY HAVE NAMES LIKE LONG TRM PETENTIATION LONG TURM DEPRESSION WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH EMOTIONAL DEPRESSION BY THE WAY SPITE TIME INDEPENDENT PLASTOSY I THREW OUT THOSE NAMES NOT TO CONFUSE YOU BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT WOULD LIKE MORE INDEPTH EXPLORATION OF THOSE PLEASA YOU CAN GOGUGL TOSE AND LOOK THEM UP THEIR GREAT WICCAPEDIA PAGES FOR THEM AND YOU CAN GO DOWN THE PAPER TRAIL I MIGHT EVEN TOUCH ON THEM UN SUBSUBSEQUENT EPISODES BUT THE IMPORTHING UNDERSTAND IS THAT IF WE WANT SOMETHING TO CHANGE WE REALLY NEED TO BRING AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF ATTENTION TO WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE WANT TO CHANGE THIS IS VERY MUCH LENGTH TO THE STATEMENT I MADE EARLIER ABOUT THE IT ALL STARTS WITHIN AWARENESS NOW WHY IS THAT ATTENTION IMPORTANT WELL DAVID AND TORNSTON ONE THEIRE NOBO PRIZE AND THEY CERTAINLY DESERVED IT THEY PROBABLY DESERVE TOO BECAUSE THEY LSO FIGURED OUT HOW VISION WORKS AND I MIGHT BE BIASED CAUSE THERE MY SCIENTIFIC GREAT GRANDPARENTS BUT I THINK EVERYBODY IN THE FIELD OF NOROW SCIENCE AGREES THAT HUBEL AND WEASEL AS THEY'RE CALLED ACIENT W FOR THOSE IN THE GAME ABSOLUTELY DESERVED A NOBLE PRIZE FOR THEIR WORK BECAUSE THEY REALLY UNVEILED THE MECHANISMS OF BRAINCHANGE OF PLASTICITY DAVID PASSED AWAY A FEW YEARS AGO TORNSON STILL LIVIES IN HIS LATE NINETIES HE STILL AT THE ROCK TOF FELLOW UNIVERSITY HE SHARP AS ATTACK HE STILL JOG SEVERAL MILES A DAY HE'S REALLY INTO ART IN A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS HES ALSO A SUPERNIZE SKY HUBA WAS A REALLY NICSKY AS WELL AS ALSO HE WAS A GREAT FRISBI PLAYER I DISCOVERED CAUSE HE BEAT ME AT A GAME ULTIMATE WHEN HE WAS LIKE EIGHTY WHICH STILL AS MEAL BIT IRKED BUT ANYWAY HUBOL VEZIL DID AN AMAZING THING FOR SCIENCE THAT WILL FOREVER CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE THINGK ABOUT THE BRAIN HOWEVER THEY WERE QUITE WRONG ABOUT THIS CRITICAL PERIOD THING THE CRITICAL PERIOD WAS THIS IDEA THAT IF YOU WERE TO DEPRIVE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF AN IMPUT SAY CLOSING ONE EYE EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT AND THE REST OF THE VISUAL CARTEX HAS TAKEN OVER BY THE REPRESENTATION OF THE OPEN EYE THAT YOU COULD NEVER CHANGE THAT UNLESS YOU INTERVENED EARLY AND THIS ICTALLY FORM THE BASIS FOR WHY A KID THAT HAS A LAZY EYE OR A CATARACT WHY EVEN THOUGH THEIR SOME ISSUES WITH A ANASTESIA AND YOUNG CHILDREN WHY NOW WE KNOW THAT YOU WANT O GET IN THEIRE EARLY IN AND FIX THE CATARACT OR FIX THE STERABUSIMESS TRODOPTHEMOL JUST DU HOWEVER THEIR IDEA THAT YOU HAD TO DO IT EARLY OR ELSE THERE WAS NO OPPORTUNITY TO RESCUE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPIS IT LATER ON TURNED OUT WASN'T ENTIRELY TRUE IN THE EARLY NINETIES A GRADUATE SOON BY THE NAME OF GREG RECKON'S OWN WAS IN THE LABORATORY OF A GY NAME MIKE MERSONEC IT YOU SEE AS AF AND THEY SET OUT TO TEST THIS IDEA THAT IF ONE WANTS TO CHANGE THEIR BRAIN THEY NEED TO DO IT EARLY IN LIFE BECAUSE THE ADULT BRAIN SIMPLY IS IN PLASTIC IT'S NOT AVAILABLE FOR THESE CHANGES AND THEY DID A SERIES OF ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL EXPERIMENTS BY NOW I THINK WE CAN SAY PROVING THAT THE ADULT BRAIN N CAN CHANGE PROVIDED CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET NOW THE EXPERIMENTS THEY DID ARE TOUGH THEY WERE TOUGH ON THE EXPERIMENT TER AND THEY WERE TOUGH ON THE SUBJECT I'LL JUST DESCRIBE ONE WHAT SAY YOU WERE A SUBJECT IN ONE OFTHEIR EXPERIMENTS YOU WOULD COME INTO THE LAB AND YOU SIT DOWN IN THE TABLE AND THEY WOULD RECORD FRUM OR IMMAGURE BRAIN AND LOOK AT THE REPRESENTATION OF YOUR FINGERS THE DIGITS AS WE CALL THEM AND THERE WOULD BE A SPINNING DRUM LITERALLY A LIKE A A THE STONE DRUM IN FRONTY OR METAL DRUM THEY HAD LITTLE BUMPS SOME OF THE BUMPS WERE SPACED CLOSE TOGETHER SOME OF THEM WERE SPACED FAR APART AND THEY WOULD DO THESE EXPERIMENTS WHERE THEY WOULD EXPECT THEIR SUBJECTS TO PRESS A LEVER WHENEVER FOR INSTANCE THE BUMPS GOT CLOSER TOGETHER OR FURTHER APART AND THESE WERE VERY SUBTLE DIFFERENCES SO IN ORDER TO DO THIS YOU REALLY HALFE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE BUMPS AND THESE WERE NOT BRAIL READERS OR ANY ONE SKILLED TIN DOING THESE KINDS OF EXPERIMENTS WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT AS PEOPLE PAID MORE AND MORE ATTENTION TO THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THESE BUMPS AND THEY WOULD SIGNAL WHEN THERE WAS A CHANGE BY PRESSING A LEVER AS THEY DID THAT THERE WAS VERY RAPID CHANGES PLASTICITY IN THE REPRESENTATION OF THE FINGERS AND IT COULD GO IN EITHER DIRECTION YOU COULD GET PEOPLE VERY GOOD AT DETECTING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN A BUMPS THAT WITH THE DISTANCE WAS GETTING SMALLER OR THEWAS GETTING GREATER SO PEOPLE COULD GET VERY GOOD AT THESE TASKS THAT OU ARE KIND OF HARD TO IMAGINE HOW THEY WOULD TRANSLATE TO THE REAL WORLD FOR A NONBRAIL READER BUT WHAT IT TOLD US IS THAT THESE MAPS OF TOUCH WERE VERY MUCH AVAILABLE FOR PLASTICITY AND THESE WERE FULLY ADULT SUBJECTS THEUGH NOT TAKING ANY SPECIFIC DRUGS THEYR NIT DON'T HAVE ANY IMPAIRIMENTS THAT WE'RE AWARE OF AND WHAT IT SHOWED WHAT IT PROVED IS THAT THE ADULT BRAIN IS VERY PLASTIC AND THEY DID SOME BEAUTIFUL CONTROL EXPERIMENTS THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND WHICH THAT SOMETIMES THEY WOULD BRING PEOPLE IND ANDTHEY WOULD HAVE THEM TOUCH THE THESE BUMPS ON THIS SPINNING DRUM BUT THEY WOULD HAVE THE PERSON PAY ATTENTION TO AN AUDITORY CUE EVERY TIME A TONE WOULD GO OFF OR THEYE WAS A SHIFT IN THE PITCH OF THAT TONE THEY WULD HAVE TO SIGNAL THAT SO THE SUBJECT THOUGHT THEY WERE DOING SOMETHING RELATED TO TOUCH AN HEARING AND ALL THAT SHOWED WAS THAT IT WASN'T JUST THE MERE ACTION OF TOUCHING THESE BUMPS THEY HAD TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE BUMPS THEMSELVES IF THEY HAD WERE PLACING THEIR ATTENTION ON THE AUDITORY CUE ON THE TONE WELL THEN THERE WAS PLASTICITY IN THE AUDITORY PORTION OF THE BRAIN BUT NOT ON THE TOUCH PORTIONOF THE BRAIN AND THIS REALLY SPITS IN THE FACE OF THIS THING THAT YOU HEARE SO OFTEN WHICH IS EVERY EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE AS GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY YOUR BRAINWORKS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE EXPERIENCEIS THAT YOU PAY SUPERCAREFUL ATTENTION TO ARE WHAT OPEN UP PLASTICITY AND IT OPENS UP PLASTICITY TO THAT SPECIFIC EXPERIENTS SO THE QUESTION THEN IS WHY AND MERZANIC AND HIS GRADUATESONS AND POST OCKS WENT ON TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION OF WHY AND IT TURNS OUT THE ANSWER IS A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD NURO CHEMICAL ANSWER AND INSIDE OF THAT ANSWER IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ANY OF US TO CHANGE OUR BRAIN AT ANY POINT THROUGHOUT OUR LIFE SPAN ESSENTIALLY FOR ANYTHING THAT WE WANT TO LEARN THAT COULD BE SUBTRACTING IN EMOTION FROM AN EXPERIENCE WE'VE HAD IT COULD BE BUILDING A GREATER RANGE OF EMOTION IT COULD BE LEARNING NEW INFORMATION LIKE LEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE IT COULD BE LEARNING NEW MOTOR SKILL LIKE DANCE OR SPORT OR IT COULD BE SOME COMBINATION OF COGNITIVE MOTOR SO FOR INSTANCE A AIR TROPIC CONTROLL OR HAS TO DO A LOT WITH THEIR MIND IN ADDITION TO A LOT WITH THEIR HANDS SO IT'S NOT JUST COGNIVE ITS NOT JUST MOTOR BUT COMBINED SO WERE IN A TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT CHEMICAL IS BUT TO JUST GIVE YOU IN IMPORTANT HINT THAT CHEMICAL IS THE SAME CHEMICAL OF STRESS THIS IS NOT A DISCUSSION ABOUT STRESS PERSAY IN THE FUTURE PODCAST EPISODE WILL TALK ALL ABOUT STRESS AND TOOLS TO DEAL WITH STRESS SOMETHING MY LAB WORKS ON QUITE EXTENSIVELY AND IT'S A TOPIC THAT I ENJOY DISCUSSING BUT THIS IS A TOPIC ABOUT BRAIN CHANGE AND WHAT I JUST TOLD YOU IS THAT IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE BRAIN YOU HAVE TO PAY CAREFUL ATTENTION AND THE IMMEDIATE QUESTION SHOULD BE WILL WHY WHELL THE ANSWER IS THAT WHEN WE PAY CAREFUL ATTENTION THERE ARE TWO NEROCHEMICALS NERL MODULATOR SAYS THEY'RE CALLED THAT AE RELEASED FROM MULTIPLE SITES IN OUR BRAIN THAT HIGH LIGHT THE NERL CIRCUITS THAT STAND A CHANCE OF CHANGING NOW IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE OF THER CAN CHANGE BUT IT'S THE FIRST GAIT THAT HAS TO OPEN IN ORDER FOR CHANGE TO OCCUR AND THE FIRST NEROCHEMICAL IS EPINEFERAN ALSO A DRENALINE WE CALL IT A DRENALINE WHEN IT'S RELEASE FROM THE DRENAL GLANDS ABOVE OUR KIDNEYS THAT'S IN THE BODY WE CALL EPINEFERAN IN THE BRAIN BUT THEY ARE CHEMICALLY IDENTICAL SUBSTANCES EPINEPFERON IS RELEASED FROM A REGION IN THE BRAINSTEM CALLE LOCUS CERULIOUS FANCY NAME YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW IT UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOCUS SERULIUS SENDS OUT THESE LITTLE WIRES WE CALL AXONS SUCH THAT IT HOSES THE ENTIRE BRAIN ESSENTIALLY IN THIS NERCHEMICAL EPINEFERON NOW IT'S NOT ALWAYS HOSING THE BRAIN WITH EPINEPRAN IT'S ONLY WHEN WE ARE IN HIGH STATES OF ALERTNESS THAT THIS EPINEPFRANT IS RELEASED BUT THE WAY THIS CIRCUITED DESIGN ITS VERY NON SPECIFIC IT'S ESSENTIALLY WAKING UP THE ENTIRE BRAIN THAT'S BECAUSE THE WAY THAT EPINEPERAN WORKS BY BINDING PARTICULAR RECEPTERS IS TO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT NURONS WILL BE ACTIVE SO NO ALERTNESS NO NERL PLASTICITY HOWEVER ALERTNESS ALONE IS NOT SUFFICIENT AS WE WOULD SAY IT'S NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT FOR NERL PLASTICITY WE KNOW THIS IS TRUE ALSO FROM THE WORK OF HUBAN WEASEL WHERE THEY LOOKED AT BRAIN PLASTICITY TO IN RESPONSE TO CERTAIN EXPERIENCES IN SUBJECTS THAT WERE EITHER AWAKE OR A SLEEP AND I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU BUT YOU CANNOT JUST SIMPLY LISTEN TO THINGS IN YOUR SLEEP AND LEARN N THOSE MATERIALS LATER I'LL TALK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN DO CERTAIN THINGS IN YOUR SLEEP THAT YOU ARE UNAWARE OF THAT CAN HANCE LEARNING OF THINGS THAT YOU WERE AWARE OF WHILE YOU ARE AWAKE BUT THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS JUST LISTENING TO SOME MUSIC OR LISTENING TO A TAPE WHILE YOU SLEEP AND EXPECTING IT TO SINK IN SO TO SPEAK EPINEPHRAN IS RELEASED WHEN WE PAY ATTENTION AND WHEN WE ARE ALERT BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR GETTING PLASTESY IS THAT THERE BE EPINEPHRAN WHICH EQUATES TO ALERTNESS PLUS THE RELEASE OF THIS NERMODULATOR ASEDO COLING NOW ACEDO COLING IS RELEASED FROM TWO SITES IN THE BRAIN ONE IS ALSO IN THE BRAIN STEM AND ITS NAME DIFFERENT THINGS IN DIFFERENT ANIMALS BUT IN HUMANS THE MOST RICH SIGHT OF A SEDO COLING NURONS OR NORONS THAT MAKE ASEDO COLING IS THE PARABIGEMINAL NUCLEUS OR THE PERABRACHIO REGION THEIR NUMBER DIFFERENT NAMES OF THESE AGGREGATES OF NURONS YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW THE NAMES ALL YOU EED TO KNOW IS THAT YOU HAVE AN AIR IN YOUR BRAINSTEM AND THAT AREA SENDS WIRES THESE ACTS ONS UP INTO THE AREA OF THE BRAIN THAT PHILTERS SENSORY IMPUT S WE HAVE THIS AREATHA RING CALL THE FALAMUS AND IT IS GETTING BOMBARDED WITH ALL SORTS OF SENSORYAN PUT ALL THE TIME COSTELLO'S SNORING OFF TO MY RIGHT THE LIGHTS THAT ARE IN THE ROOM THE PRESENCE OF MY COMPUTER TO MY LEFT ALL OF THAT IS COMING IN BUT WHEN I PAY ATTENTION TO SOMETHING LIKE TY REALLY HONE IN ON COSTELLO SNORING I CREATE A CONE OF ATTENTION AND WHAT THAT CONE OF ATTENTION REFLECTS IS THAT A SEDO COLING IS NOW AMPLIFYING THE SIGNAL OF SOUNDS THAT COSTELLO IS MAKING WITH HIS SNORING AND ESSENTIALLY MAKING THAT SIGNAL GREATER THAN ALL THE SIGNAL AROUND IT WHAT WE CALL SIGNAL TO NOISE GOES UP SO AS A VIEW WITH AN ENGINEERING BACKRON WILL BE FAMILIAR WITH SIGNAL THE NOISE THOSE YOU NOT HAVE AN ENGINEERING BACKGROUND DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT ALL IT MEANS IS THAT ONE PARTICULAR SHOUT IN THE CROWD COMES THROUGH COSTELLO'S SNORING BECOMES MORE SALIENT MORE APPARENT RELATIVE TO EVERYTHING ELSE GOING ON ACEDO COLING ACTS AS A SPOT LIGHT BUT EPINEPHRON FOR ALERTNESS A CEDO COLING SPOTLIGHTING THESE IMPUTS THOSE TWO THINGS ALONE ARE NOT ENOUGH TO GET PLASTESY THERE NEEDS TO BE THIS THIRD COMPONENT AND THE THIRD COMPONENT IS A SEDO COLING RELEASED FROM AN AREA OF THE FORBAING CALLED NUCLEUS BASALUS YOU REALLY WANT TO GET TECHNICAL IT'S CALLED NUCLEUS BASALUS OF MY NERT FOR ANY OF YOU THAT ARE BUDDING PHYSICIANS ARE GOING TO MEDICAL SCHOOL YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT IF YOU HAVE A CEDOCOLING RELEASED FROM THE BRAINSTEM A SEDO COLING RELEASED FROM NUCLEUS BASALUS AND EPINEPHRON YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR BRAIN AND I CAN SAY THAT WITH CONFIDENCE BECAUSE MERSINIC AND RECKONZONE AS WELL AS OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ABMERSONIC LAB MICHAEL KILGARD AND OTHERS DID THESE INCREDIBLE EXPERIMENTS WHERE THEY STIMULATED THE RELEASE OF A SEDO COLING FROM NUCLEUS BASALUS EITHER WITH AN ELECTRODE OR WITH SOME OTHER METHODS THAT WILL TALK ABOUT AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS WHEN YOU STIMU LATE THESE THREE BRAIN REGIONS LOCOSERULIUS THE BRAINSTEM SOURCE OF A SEETAL COLING AND THEN THE BASAL FORBRAINE SOURCE OF A SEETAL COLLING WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE THREE THINGS WHATEVER YOU HAPPEN TO BE LISTENING TO DOING OR PAYING ATTENTION TO IMMEDIATELY IN ONE TRIAL TAKES OVER THE REPRESENTATION OF A PARTICULARY THE BRAIN YOU ESSENTIALLY GET RAPID MASSIVE LEARNING IN ONE SHOP AND THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN IN A VARIETY OF PAPERS ALSO BY AGUYD NAME NOR WINEBURGER FROM YOU SEE ERVINE AND IT IS NOW CONSIDERED A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WORKS SO WHILE HUBON WEASEL TALKED ABOUT CRITICAL PERIODS AND DEVELOPMENTAL PLASTICITY IT'S VERY CLEAR FROM THE WORK OF MERSONIC AND WINEBURG AND OTHERS THAT IF YOU GET THESE THREE THINGS IF YOU CAN ACCESS THESE THREE THINGS OF EPINEFERAN A SETO COLLING FROM THESE TWO SOURCES NOT ONLY WILL THE NERVOUS SYSTEM CHANGE IT HAS TO CHANGE IT ABSOLUTELY WILL CHANGE AND THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR PEOPLE TO NDERSTAND IF THEY WANT A CHANGE THE BRAIN YOU CAN NOT JUST PASSIVELY EXPERIENCE THINGS AND REPETITION CAN BE IMPORTANT BUT THE WAY TO USE REPETITION TO CHANGE YOUR BRAIN IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT SO NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW WE WOULD TRANSLATE ALL THE SCIENTIC INFORMATION AND HISTORY INTO SOME PROTOCALS THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY APPLY BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHAT MANY OF YOUR INTERESTED IN AND I'M WILLING TO BET THAT MOST OF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED IN LOWERING ELECTRODES INTO YOUR NUCLEOS PISALIS AND FRANKLY NEITHER AM I IN EPISODE ONE OF THE HUBERMAN LAB PODCAST I DESCRIBED THE VARIOUS WAYS THAT PEOPLE CAN MONITOR AND CHANGE THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEM THOSE WAYS INCLUDE BRAIN MACHINE IN ERPHASE PHARMICHOLOGY BEHAVIORAL PRACTICES AND THOSE BEHAVIOURAL PRACTICES OF COURSE CAN INCLUDE SOME DOS DO THIS AND SOME DON'TS DON'T DO THAT ET CETERA IN THINKI ABOUT NERROL PLASTICITY I ONT HAVE A VERY FRANK CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT ONE CAN DO BUT ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS UNTAPPED CAPACITY THAT I'M JUST NOT HEARING ABOUT OUT THERE WHICH IS ONE CAN ALSO COMBINE BEHAVIORAL PRACTICES WITH PHARMOCOLOGY ONE CAN BE COMBINE BEHAVIORAL PRACTICES WITH BRIN MACHINE INHER FACE AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT IN FACT I'M NOT RECOMMENDING YOU DO ANY ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR AS ALWAYS I'LL SAY IT AGAIN I'M NOT A PHYSICIAN SO DON'T PRESCRIBE ANYTHING AM A PROFESSOR SO PROFESSO LOT OF THINGS WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR HEALTH AND YOUR MEDICAL CARRIERS UP TO YOU YOUR RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR HEALTH ANDWELL BEING SO I'M NOT GIN TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO OR WHAT TO TAKE I'M UNDESCRIBE WHAT THE LITERATURE TELLS US AND SUGGESTS ABOUT WAYS TO ACCESS PLASTICITY WE KNOW WE NEED UP AN EFFERENT THAT MEANS ALERTNESS MOST PEOPLE ACCOMPLISH THIS THROUGH A CUP OF COFFEE AND A GOOD NIGHTS SLEEP SO I WILL SAY YOU SHOULD MASTER YOUR SLEEP SCHEDUAL AND YOU SHOULD FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH SLEEP YOU NEED IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE ALERTNESS WHEN YOU SIT DOWN TO LEARN ALL THE TOOLS AND MORE SCIENCE THAN PROBABLY EVER WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT SLEEP AND HOW TO GET BETTER AT SLEEPING AND TIMING YOUR SLEEP ET CETERA AND NAPS AND ALL OF THAT IS IN EPISODES TWO THREE FOREIGN FIVE OF THE HURUN LABPODCASTOI INCURGE YOU TO REFER TO THOSE IF YOUR SLEEP IS NOT WHERE YOU WOULD LIKE IT TO BE YOU'RE ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN DELIBERATE FOCUST ALERTNESS IS IN TDIRECT PROPORTION TO HOW WELL YOU ARE SLEEPING ON A REGULAR BASIS I THINK THAT'S KIND OF AN OBVIOUS ONE SO GET YOUR SLEEP HANDLED BUT ONCE THAT'S IN PLACE THE QUESTION THEN IS HOW DO I ACCESS THIS ALERTNESS WELL THEI'RE NUMBER WAYS SOME PEOPLE USE SOME PRETTY ELABORATE A PSYCHOLOGICAL GUMNASTICS THEY WILL TELL PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING AND CREATE SOME ACCOUNT ABILITY THAT COULD BE REALLY GOOD OR THEY'LL POST TO PICTURE OF THEMSELVES ON LINE AND THEY'LL COMMIT TO LEARNING IT CERTAIN AMOUNT A LOSING SCUSE ME A CERTAIN AMOUNT AWEIGT OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS SO THEY CAN USE EITHER A SHAMEBASED A A PRACTICES TO POTENTIALLY EMBARRASS THEMSELVES THAT THEY DON'T FOLLOW THROUGH THEY'LL WRITE CHECKS TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT THEY HATE AND INSIST THAT THEY'LL CASH THEM IF THEY DON'T ACTUALLY FOLLOW THROUGH OR THEY'LL DO IT OUT OF LOVE YOU KNOW THEY'LL DECIDE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO UM RUN A MARITHON OR LEARN A LANGUAGE OR SOMETHING BECAUSE OF SOMEBODY THEY LOVE OR THEY WANT TO DEVOTE IT TO SOMEBODY THE TRUTH IS THAT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF EPINEFERAN AND GETTING ALERT AN ACTIVATED IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER EPINEFRAN IS A CHEMICAL AND YOUR BRAIN DOES NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN DOING THINGS OUT OF LOVE OR HATE ANGER OR FEAR IT REALLY DOESN'T ALL OF THOSE PROMOTE AUTONOMIC AROUSAL AND THE RELEASE OF EPINEFFERENC SO I THINK FOR MOST PEOPLE IF YOU'RE FEELING NOT MOTIVATED TO MAKE THESE CHANGES THE KEYTHING IS TO IDENTIFY NOT JUST ONE BUT PROBABLY A KIT OF REASONS SEVERAL REASONS AS TO WHY YOU WOULD WANT TO MAKE THIS PARTICULAR CHANGE AND BEING DRAWN TOWARD A PARTICULAR GOAL THAT YOU'RE EXCITED ABOUT CAN BE ONE ALSO BEING MOTIVATED TO NOT BE COMPLETELY AFRAID ASHAMED OR HUMILIATED FOR NOT FALLING THROUGHONAGOAL IS ANOTHER SHWONT TO BRIEFLY MENTION ONE LITTLE ASIDE THERE BECAUS I'VE GOT A FRIEND WHOS A A PHYSICIAN HE'S A CARDIOLOGIST WHO HAS A REALLY INTERESTING THEORY THIS IS JUST THEORY BY THINK IT WILL RESONATE WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE WHICH IS THAT AT YOU'VE ALL HEARD OF THIS MOLECULE DOPOMINE THAT GIVES US THE SENSE OF REWARD WHEN WE ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING WELL WE ALSO WANT TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS DOPAMIN WHILE WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS THINGS ENJOY THE PROCESSES THEY SAY CAUSE IT HAS ALL SORTS OF PAUSIV EFFECTS GIVES US ENERGY ET CETERA WITH MY FRIEND WHAT HE SAYS IS YOU KNOW THERE'S MANY MANY INSTANCES WHERE SOME ONE WILL COME TO HIM AND SAY YOU NOT I'M AN A WRITE A BOOK AND HE SAYS OH THAT'S GREAT I'M SURE THE BOOKS CAN BE TERRIFIC AND YOU REALLY SHOULD WRITE A BOOK AND THN THEY NEVER GO DO IT AND HIS THEORY IS IF YOU GET SO MUCH DOPOMING FROM THE REWARD OF PEOPLE SAYING OH YA YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY GOIN TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT YOU MIGHT NOT ACTUALLY GO AFTER THE THE REWARD OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENT ITSELF SO BEWARE THESE POSITIVE REINFORCEMENTS ALSO NOT SAYING PEOPLE SHOULD FLAGULATE THEMSELVES TO THE POINT OF VICTORY IN WHATEVER THEIR PURSUING BUT MOTIVATION IS A TRICKY ONE SO I SUGGEST THAT EVERYONE ASK THEMSELVES WHAT IS IT THAT I WANT TO ACCOMPLISH AND WHAT IS IT THAT'S DRIVING ME TO ACCOMPLISH THIS AND COME UP WITH TWO OR THREE THINGS FEAR BASED PERHAPS LOVE BASED PERHAPS OR PERHAPS SEVERAL OF THOSE IN ORDER TO INSURE ALERTNESS ENERGY AND ATTENTION FOR THE TASK AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE ATTENTION PART NOWIT'S ONE THING O HAVE AN ELECTROTE IMBEDDED INTO YOUR BRAIN AND INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF A SEEDAL CALLING IT'S ANOTHER TO EXIST IN THE REAL WORLD OUTSIDE THE LABORATORY AND HAVE TROUBLE FOCUSSING HAVING TROUBLE BRINGING YOUR ATTENTION TO A PARTICULAR LOCATION IN SPACE FOR A PARTICULAR EVENT AND THERE IS A LOT OF DISCUSSION NOWADAYS AREABOUT SMART PHONES AND DEVICES CREATING A SORT OF ATTENTION DEFISIT A ALMOST AT A CLINICAL LEVEL FOR MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING ADULTS I THINK THAT'S LARGELY TRUE AND WHAT IT MEANS HOWEVER IS THAT WE ALL ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR LEARNING HOW TO CREATE DEPTH OF A FOCUS THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT NERROSCINS PRINCIPLES TO GET DEPTH OF FOCUS I WANT O BRIEFLY TUCK ABOUT THE PHARMACOLOGY FIRST BECAUSE I ALWAYS GET ASKED ABOUT THIS PEOPLE SAY WHAT CAN I TAKE TO INCREASE MY LEVELS OF A SEEDA CALLING WELL THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN TAKE NICOTINE IS CALLED NICOTINE BECAUSE ASETOCOLING BINDS TO THE NICOTINIC RECEPTOR THE TWO KINDS OF A SEDOCOLLING RECEPTORS MUSKERANIC AND NICOTINIC BUT THE NICOTNIC ONES ARE INVOLVED IN ATTENION AND ALERTNESS I HAVE COLLEAGUES THESE ARE NOT MY A YOU KNOW KIND OF LIKE BROSCIENCE BUDIES I HAVE THOSE FRIENDS TOO THS THIS IS A NO NOBELL PRIZE WINNING COLLEAGUE WHO CHOOSE NICKERET WHILE HE WORKS HE USED TO BE A SMOKER HE QUIT SMOKING BECAUSE A FEAR OF LUNGCANCER MK SMART CHOICE BUT HE MISSED THE LEVEL OF FOCUS THAT HE COULD BRING TO HIS WORK THIS IS SOMEBODY WHOSE OUT A VERY LONG CAREER AND IF YOU EVER MEET WITH HIM FOR CHAN CAN'T NAME HIM IF YOU EVER MEET WITH HIM WHAT YOU REALIZES HE CHOOSE ABOUT FIVE PIECES OF NICKER AT AN HOUR WHICH I AM NOT SUGGESTING PEOPLE DO BUT WHEN I ASKED HIM WHY YOU DOING THIS HE SAID WILL INCREASES MY ALERTNESS AND FOCUS AND ALSO HIS THEORY AND I WANT A REALLY UNDERSCORE THAT ITS THEORY NOT SCIENTIFICALLY SUPPORTED YET IS THAT IT OFFSETS PARKINSONS AND ALCIMERS IT IS TRUE THAT NUCLIUS PASALUS IS THE PRIMARY SIHTE OF DEGENERATION IN THE BRAIN IN PEOPLE THAT HAVE DEMENTIA AND PARKINSINS AND IT'S WHAT LEADS TO A LOT OF THEIR INABILITY TO FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION NOT JUST DEFISITS AND PLASTISY SO HE MIGHT BE ON TO SOMETHING NOW I'VE TRIED CHEWING NICKERET MAKES ME SUPERGITERY I DON'T LIKE IT BECAUSE I CAN'T FOCUS VERY WELL IT CONNIT TAKES ME TOO FAR UP THE LEVEL OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL I'VE GOT FRIENDS THAT DIP NICKERET ALL DAY SOME OF WHOM ARE SCIENTIS WRITERS AND ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE EFFECTS OF NICOTINE FROM THE ERA WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE SMOKED AND FORTUNATELY FEW ERE PEOPLE SMOKE NOW SO IF YOURE INTEREST IN THE PHARMACOLOGY THERE ARE SUPPLEMENTS AND THINGS THAT CAN INCREASE COLINURGIC TRANSMISSION IN THE BRAIN I'M NOT SUGGESTING YOU DO THIS BUT IF YOU ARE GOING TO GO DOWN THAT ROUTE YOU WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL HOW MUCH YOU RELY ON THOSE OLL THE TIME BECAUSE THE ESSENCE OF PLASTICITY IS TO CREATE A WINDOW OF ATTENTION IN FOCUS THAT DISTINCT FROM THE REST OF YOUR DAY THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO CREATE A MARK IN YOUR BRAIN AND THE POTENTIAL FOR PLASTICITY THINGS THAT INCREASE TE SEDO COLING BESIDES NICCOTINE OR NICORETT THE NICTIN COAN COME FROM VARIETY OF SOURCES OR THINGS LIKE ALPHAG P C OR COLING THERE ARE NUMBER OF THESE THINGS I WOULD INCOURAGE YOU TO GO TO EXAMINE DOT CAM THE WEBSIHTE AND JUST PUT IN A SETO COLING THAND IT WILL GIVE YOU A A LIST OF SUPPLEMENTS AS WELL AS SOME OF THE DANGERS OF THESE SUPPLEMENTS THAT AR ASSOCIATE WITH COLINURGICT TRANSMISSION BUT I WOULD BE REMISS AND I WOULD BE LYING IF I DIDN'T SAY THAT THERERE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE USING COLINERGIC DRUGS IN ORDER TO INCREASE THEI'RE LEVEL OF FOCUS AND SINCE WE'RE COMING UP ON THE OLYMPICS I DO ON'T GET ANYONE IN TROUBLE BUT I'M WELL AWARE THAT THE FACT THAT THE SPRINTERS ARE REALLY INTO COLINERGIC DRUGS BECAUSE NOT ONLY AS A SETO COLING IMPORTANT FOR THE FOCUS THAT ALLOWS THEM TO HEAR THE GUN AND BE FIRST OUT THE BLOCKS ON THE SPRINTS THAT'S A LOT OF WHERE THE RACEIS ONE HEARING THAT GUN AND BEING QUICKEST ON REACTION TIME SO THEY TAKE COLINURGICCASION FOR THAT AS WELL AS A SEETO COLING IS THE MOLECULE THAT CONTROLS NERVE TOMUSCLE CONTRACTION SO YOUR SPEED OF REFLEXES IS ACTUALLY CONTROL BY THIS NICATENENT TRANSMISSION AS WELL SO LOTS TO THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF ASETO COLING IN SPORT AND MENTALOCUITY NOJOUS PLASTICITY NOW FOR MOST OF YOU YOU PROLLY DON'T WANT AT YOU NICARETT DEFFLY NO ON O SMOKE CIGARETTES OR TAKE SUPPLEMENTS FOR INCREASING A SETO COLING SO WATER SOME WAYS THAT YOU CAN INCREASE A SETO COLING AND THERE IT'SCAN A SOUND LIKE A BIT OF A CIRCULAR ARGUMENT BUT YOU WANT TO INCREASE FOCUS HOW DO YOU INCREASE FOCUS YOUN PEOPLE ARE SO FAMILIAR WITH SITTING DOWN READING A COUPLE PAGES OF BOOK AND REALIZING THAT NONE OF ITS SUNK IN ERE TALKING O SOME ONE AND SEEING THEIR MOUTH MOVE MAYBE VEN NODDING YOUR HEAD SUBCONSCIOUSLY IN COMAND NONE OF IT SINKS IN THIS CAN BE VERY DAMAGING FOR SCHOOL WORK PERFORMANCE AND RELATIONSHIPS AS MANY OF YOU KNOW COSTELLO INCIDENTALLY NEVER SEEMS TO PAY ATTENTION ANYTHING I SAY WHILE LOOKING DIRECTLY AT ME WHICH CONTRADICTS WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY WHICH IS THAT THE BEST WAY TO GET BETTER AT FOCUSING IS TO USE THE MECHANISMS OF FOCUS THAT YOU ARE BORNE WITH AND THE KEY PRINCIPAL HERE IS THAT MENTAL FOCUS FOLLOWS VISUAL FOCUS WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT OUR VISUAL SYSTEM CAN BE UNFOCUSE BLURRY OR JUMPING AROUND OR WE CAN BE VERY LAZER FOCUST ON ONE LOCATION IN SPACE WHAT'S INTERESTING AND VITALLY IMPORTANT T UNDERSTANDING HOW TO ACCESS NORAL PLASTICITY IS THAT YOU CAN USE YOUR VISUAL FOCUS AND YOU CAN INCREASE YOUR VISUAL FOCUS AS A WAY OF INCREASING YOUR MENTAL OF FOK FOCUS ABILITIES MORE BROADLY SO I'MAN EXPLAIN HOW TO DO THAT PLASTICITY STARTS WITH ALERTNES AND AS I MENTION BEFORE THAT ALERTNESS CAN COME FROM A SENSE OF LOVE OF A SENSE OF JOY A SENSE OF FEAR OESN'T MATTER THERE ARE FARMOCOLOGIC WAYS TO ACCESS ALERTNESS TOO THE MOST COMMON ONE IS OF COURSE KAFFINE WHICH IF YOU WATCH THE SLEEP EPISODES YOU KNOW REDUCES THIS MOLECULE THAT MAKES A SLEEPY CALL THA DENICINE I DRINK PLENTY OF KAFFINE OM A Y HEAVY USER OF KAFFIE AND OTHINK ABUSER OF KAFFI NOTHING IN REASONABLE AMOUNTS PROVIDED WE CAN STILL FALL SLEEP AT NIGHT KAFFINE CAN BE A RELATIVELY SAFE WAY TO INCREASE EPINEFERAN NOW MANY PEOPLE ARE NOW ALSO USING ATERALL ADARALL CHEMICALLY LOOKS A LOT LIKE AMPHETAMINE AND BASICALLY IT IS AMPHETOMINE IT WILL INCREASE EPANEFFERAN RELEASE FROM LOCUS TO RELEAS IT WILL WAKE UP THE BRAIN AND THAT'S WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE RELY ON IT IT DOES HAVE A HEAVY BASIS FOR USE IN CERTAIN CLINICAL SYNTRUMS PRESCRIBE SUCH AS ATTENTION DEFICIT HOWEVER IT ALSO HAS A HIGH PROBABILITY OF ABUSE ESPECIALLY IN THOSE WHO ARE NOT PRESCRIBED IT ADARALL WILL NOT INCREASE FOCUS IT INCREASES ALERTNESS IT DOES NOT TOUCH THE ACETOCOLING SYSTEM AND IF THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE TAKING ATERALL SAY WHALE REALLY INCREASES MY FOCUS OVER ALL THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE YOUR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS JUST VERING TOWARDS WHAT WE CALL PARI SYMPATHETIC YOUR REALLY JUST VERY SLEEPY INTO ITS BRING YOUR LEVELS OF ALERTNESS UP S I MENTION ADARALL IS VERY PROBLEMATIC FOR A NUMBER OF PEOPLE AS IT CAN BE HAVE IT FORMING LEARNING ON ATURALL DOES NOT ALWAYS TRANSLATE TO HIGH PERFORMANCE OFF OR ON ATERALL LATER TIMES AND THE ADARLL DISCUSSION IS A BROADER ONE THAT PERHAPS WE SHOULD HAVE WITH A PSYCHIATRIST IN THE ROOM AT SOME POINT BECAUSE IT IS A VERY WIDELY ABUSED DRUG AT THIS POINT IN TIME THE ACEETAL COLINE SYSTEM AND THE FOCUS THAT IT BRINGS IS AVAILABLE AS I MENTION THROUGH PHARMOCHOLOGY BUT ALSO THROUGH BETHESE BEHAVIORAL PRACTICES AND THE BEHAVIORAL PRACTICES THAT ARE ANCHORED IN VISUAL FOCUS ARE GOING TO BE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO DEVELOP GREAT DEPTH AND DURATION OF FOCUS S LET'S THINK ABOUT VISUAL FOCUS FOR A SECOND WHEN WE FOCUS ON SOMETHING VISUALLY WE HAVE TWO OPTIONS WE CAN EITHER LOOK AT A VERY SMALL REGION OF SPACE WITH A LOT OF DETAIL AND A LOT OF PRECISION OR WE CAN DILATE OUR GAYS AND WE CAN SEE BIG PIECES OF VISUAL SPACE WITH VERY LITTLE DETAIL IT'S A TRATE OFF WE CAN'T LOOK AT EVERYTHING AT HIGH RESOLUTION THIS IS WHY WE HAVE THESE THAT THE PUPIL MORE O LESS RELATES TO THE FOVIA OF THE EYE WHICH IS THE AREAN WHICH WE HAVE THE MOST RECEPTORS THE HIGHEST DENSITY OF RECEPTORS THAT PRECEIVE LIGHT AND SO OUR CUITY IS MUCH BETTER IN THE CENTERE OF AR VISUAL FIELD THAN IN OUR PARIPHERY THE SIMPLE EXPERIMENT YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW IF YOUR LISTENING TO THIS YOU CAN STILL DO IT YOU CAN HOLD YOUR T YOUR HANDS OUT IN FRONT OF YOU PROVIDED THAT YOUR CITED YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE HOW MANY FINGERS YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU FOR ME IT'S FIVE STILL GET ALL FIVE FINGERS MAZINGLY ENOUGH IF I MOVE MY HAND OFF TO THE SIDE A I CAN'T SEE THEM WITH PRECISION BUT AS I MOVE THEM BAC KIN TO THE CENTRE OF MY VISUAL FIELD I CAN SEE THEM WITH PRECISION AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE DENSITY THE NUMBER OF PICSLES IN THE CENTER F MY VISUAL FIELD AS MUCH HIGHER THAN IT IS IN THE PERIFERY WHEN WE FOCUS OUR EYES WE DO A COUPLE THINGS FIRST OF ALL WE TEND TO DO THAT IN THE CENTERE OF OUR VISUAL FIELD AND OUR TWO EYES TEND TO A LINE IN WHAT'S CALLED A VIRGENT SEYE MOVEMENT TOWARDS A COMMON POINT THE OTHER THING THAT HAPPENS IS THE LENDS OF OUR EYE MOVE SO THAT OUR BRAIN NOW NO LONGER SEES THE ENTIRE VISUAL WORLD BUT IS SEEING A SMALL CONE OF VISUAL IMAGERY IF IT TOS THE DOG BUMPING INTO THE WALL FOR DOMING THAT SMALL CONE OF VISUAL IMAGERY OR SODA STRAW VIEW OF THE WORLD HAS MUCH HIGHER ACUITY HIGHER RESOLUTION THAN IF I WERE TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING NOW YOU SAY OF COURSE THIS MAKES PR VER SENSE BUT THAT'S ABOUT VISUL ATTENTION NOT MENTAL ATTENTION WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT FOCUS IN THE BRAIN IS ANCHOR TO OUR VISUAL SYSTEM I'LL TALK ABOUT BLIND PEOPLE IN A MOMENT BUT ASSUMING THAT SOMEBODY IS SIGHTED THE KEY IS TO LEARN HOW TO FOCUS BETTER VISUALLY IF YOU WANT TO BRING ABOUT HIGHER LEVELS OF COGNATIVE OR MENTAL FOCUS EVEN IF YOU'R ENGAGED IN A PHYSICAL TASK NOW THERE'S A REMARKABLE PHENOMENON IN ANIMALS WHERE ANIMALS THAT HAVE THEIR EYES ON THE SIDE OF THEIR HEAD ORE SCANNING THE ENTIRE VISUAL ENVIRONMENT ALL THE TIME THEY'RE NOT FOCUSED ON ANYTHING THINK YOU'RE GRAZING ANIMALS YOUR COWS YOUR SHEEP YOUR BIRDS ET CETERA BUT THINK ABOUT A BIRD PICKING UP SEEDS ON THE BEACH OR ON CONCRETE THAT BIRDS HEAD IS UP HERE IT'S UP ABOUT A FOOT OFF THE GROUND OR FIT'S A SMALL BIRD ABOUT SIX INCHES OFF THE GROUND AND IT'S EYES ARE ON THE SIDE OF ITS HEAD AND YET HAS THIS TINY BEAK THAT CAN QUICKLY PICK UP THESE LITTLE SEEDS OFF THE GROUND WITH IMMENSE PRECISION NOW IF YOU TRY TO DO THAT BY STARING OFF TO THE SIDES OF THE ROOM AND PICKING UP ITEMS IN FRONT OF YOU WITH HIGH PRECISION AT THAT TINY SCALE LITTLE TINY OBJECTS YOU WILL MISS ALMOST EVERY TIME THEY DO IT PERFECTLY AND THEY DON'T SMASH THEIR BEAK INTO TH GROUND AND DAMAGE IT THEY DO IT WITH BEAUTIFUL MOVEMENT TO CUITY ALSO HOW DO THEY DO IT HOW DO THEY CREATE THIS FOCUS OR THIS AWARENESS OF WHAT'S IN FRONT OF THEM AND TURNS OUT AS THEY LOWER THEIR HEAD THEIR EYES VERY BRIEFLY MOVE INWARD IN WHAT'S CALL THE VIRGIENSIDE MOVEMENT NOW THEIR EYES CAN'T ACTUALLY TRANSLOCATE IN THEIR HEAD THEY'RE FIXED IN THE SKULL JUST LIKE YOURS IN MINEAR BUT WHEN WE MOVE OUR EYES SLIGHTLY INWARD MAY BE CAN TELL UNDO ITS LIKE LIK SO BASICALLY SHORTENING OR ERE MAKING THE INTERPUPILARY DISTANCE AS IT'S CALLED SMALLER TWO THINGS HAPPEN NOT ONLY DO WE DEVELOP A SMALLER VISUAL WINDOW INTO THE WORLD BUT WE ACTIV ATE A SET OF NURONS IN OUR BRAIN STEM THAT TRIGGER THE RELEASE OF BOTH NOR UPINFERON EPINEFERON AND A SEEDOL CALLING ORPENAPERNIS CON A SIMILAR TEPIN AFFERON SO IN OTHER WORDS WHEN OUR EYES ARE RELAXED IN OUR HEAD WHEN WE'RE JUST NOWT LOOKING OUR ENTIREN VISUAL VIRONMENT MOVING OUR HEAD AROUND MOVING THROUGH SPACE WERE AN OPTIC FLOW THINGS MOVING PAST US OR SITTING STILL LOOKING BROADLY AT OUR SPACE WERE RELAXED WHEN OUR EYES MOVE SLIGHTLY INWARD TOWARD A PARTICULAR VISUAL TARGET OUR VISUAL WORLD SHRINKS OR LEVEL OF VISUAL FOCUS GOES UP AND WE KNOW THAT THIS RELATES TO THE RELEASE OF A SEDOCALLING AND AT AN EFFERN AT THE RELEVANT SIGHTS IN THE BRAIN FOR PLASTICITY WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT IF YOU HAVE A HARD TIME FOCUSING YOUR MIND FORSAKE OF READING OR FOR LISTENING YOU NEED TO PRACTISE AND YOU CAN PRACTISE FOCUSSING YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM AW THIS WORKS BEST IF YOU PRACTISE FOCUSSING YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM AT THE PRECISE DISTANCE FROM THE WORK THAT YOU INTEND TO DO FOR SAKE OF PLASTICITY SO HOW WULL THIS LOOK IN THE REAL WORLD LET' SAY I AM TRYING TO CONCENTRATE ON SOMETHING RELATED TO I ON NO SCIENCE O'M READING A SCIENCE PAPER IN O HAVING A HARD TIME IT'S NOT ABSORBING I MIGHT THINK THAT I'M ONLY LOOKING AT THE PAPER THAT I'M READING I'M ONLY LOOKING MY SCREEN BUT ACTUALLY MY EYES ARE PROBABLY DARTING AROUND OF IT EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN DONE ON THIS OR I'M GATHERING INFORMATION FROM TOO MANY SOURCES IN IN THE VISUAL VIRONMENT NOW PRESUMABLY BCAUSE IT'S ME I'VE ALREADY HAD MY COFFEE I'MHYDRATED I'M WELL WELL RESTED I SLEPT WELL AND I STILL EXPERIENCE THESE CHALLENGES IN FOCUSING SPENDING JUST SIXTY TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SECONDS FOCUSING MY VISUAL TENSTION ON A SMALL WINDOW OF MY SCREEN MEANING JUST ON MY SCREEN WITH NOTHING ON IT BUT BRINGING MY EYES TO THAT PARTICULAR LOCATION INCREASE IS NOT JUST MY VISUAL ACUITY FOR THAT LOCATION BUT IT BRINGS ABOUT AN INCREASE IN ACTIVITY IN A BUNCH OF OTHER BRAIN AREAS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH GATHERING INFORMATION FROM THIS LOCATION SO PUT SIMPLY IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE YOUR ABILITY TO FOCUS PRACTISE VISUAL FOCUS NOW IF YOU WEAR CONTACTS OR YOU HAVE Y WEARE OF CORRECTIVE LENSES THAT'S FINE YOU OF COURSE WOULD WANT TO USE THOSE YOU DON'T WANT A TAKE THOSE OFTEN USE AT ABLURY IMAGE THE FINER THE VISUAL IMAGE AND THE MORE THAT YOU CAN HOLD YOUR GAZE TO THAT VISUAL IMAGE THE HIE YOUR LEVELS OF ATTENTION WILL BE MANY TIMES ON INSTRAGRAM AND HERE I'VE BEEN TEASED FOR NOT BLINKING VERY OFTEN THAT'S I SHEE A PRACTISED THING WE BLINK MORE AS WE GET TIRED WHICH AS YOU HEAR IT YOUR PROLEGE O SAY DUL AS WE GET TIRED THE NURONS IN THE BRAINSTEM THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALERTNESS AND THAT HOLD THE EYELIDS OPEN START TO FALTER AND OUR EYELIDS START TO CLOSE THIS IS WHY IT'S HARD THE WORDS I CAN BARELY KEEP MY EYES OPEN WHICH MAY BE HOW YOU FEEL RIGHT NOW BUT ASSUMING THAT YOUR PAYING ATTENTION AND YOURE ALERT WHEN YOU ARE VERY ALERT YOUR EYES ARE WIDE YOUR EYES ARE OPEN AND AS YOU GET TIRED YOUR EYELIDS START TO CLOSE BLINKS ACTUALLY RESET OUR PERCEPTION OF TIME AND SPACE THIS WAS SHOWN IN A BEAUTIFUL PAPER IN CURNBYLE GA A'LL BE SURE TO POST THE REFERENCE IN THE NOTES AND BLINKING OF COURSE IS NECESSARY TO LUBRICATE THE EYES PEOPLE BLINK BECAUSE THEIR EYES MIGHT GET DRY BUT IF YOU CAN N KEEP FOCUS BY BLINKING LESS AND BY FOCUSSING YOUR EYES TO A PARTICULAR LOCATION HIS PROBABLY PRETTY CREEPY FOR YOU TO EXPERIENCES I'M DOING THIS BUT THE MORE THAT YOU CAN DO THIS THE MORE THAT YOU CAN MAINTAIN A KIND OF A CONE OR A TUNNEL OF MENTAL FOCUS AND SO I'M SORT OF REVEALING MY PRACTICE WHICH IS THAT I'VE WORKED VERY HARD THROUGH BLINKING CONTEST WITH MY FOURTEEN YOUR OLD NIECE WHO STILL BEATS ME EVERY TIME AND IT REALLY BOTHERS ME BUT ALSO JUST THROUGH MY OWN SELF PRACTISE OF LEARNING TO BLINK LESS AND FOCUSS MY VISUAL ATTENTION ON A SMALLER REGION OF SPACE NOW FOR ME THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE I'M MAINLY LEARNING THINGS ON A COMPUTER SCREEN IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE DOING SPORT IT'S QUITE A BIT DIFFERENT AND WE CAN DISCUSS HOW YOU MIGHT TRANSLATE TO SPORT IN FACT IN THE NEXT EPISODE OM IN TO TALK ALL ABOUT HOW PLASTICITY AND THE FOCUSS MECHANISMS RELATE TO LEARNING OF MOVEMENT PRACTISE AS AN CORDNINATED MOVEMENTS AS AN ENTIRE DISCUSSION UNTO ITSELF BUT THE SAME PRINCIPL HOLDS SO WE NEED ALERTNESS YOU CAN GET THAT THROUGH MENTAL TRICKS OF MOTIVATION FEAR OR LOVE WHATEVER IT IS PHARMACOLOGY PLEAE DO IT HEALTHFULLY YOU CAFFINE IF THAT'S IN YOUR PRACTICE CERTAINLY WANT TO BE WELL HYDRATED THAT INCREASES THAS SHOU WILL INCREASE ALERTNESS O HAVING A VERY FULL BLATTER WILL INCREASE THE LEARTNESS ALTHOUGH YOU DON'T WANT YOUR LEARNESS TO BE SO HIGH DO THAT THE ALL YOUCAN THING ABOUT IS THE FACT YOU HAVE TO GO YURINATE BUT CAUSE THAT'S VERY DISTRACTING YOU DON WAT YOUR ALERTNESS TO GO THROUGH THE ROOF YOU NEED FOCUS AND VISUAL FOCUS IS THE PRIMARY WAY IN WHICH WE START TO DEPLOY THESE NARROW CHEMICALS NOW YOU MAY ASK WELL WHAT ABOUT THE THE EXPERIMENT WHERE PEOPLE WERE YOUN FEELING THIS ROTATING DRUMER LISTENING TO THE AUDITORY COU THAT DOES INVOLVE VISION AT ALL AH IF YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO ARE LEARNING THINGS AUTIT WITH THEIR AUDITORY SYSTEM THEY WILL OFTEN CLOSE THEIR EYES AND THAT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE IF SOMEBODY IS LISTENING VERY HARD PLEASE DON'T ASK THEM TO LOOK YOU DIRECTLY IN THE EYE WHILE ALSO ASKING THAT THEY LISTEN TO YOU THAT'S ITUALLY ONE OF THE WORST WAYS TO GET SOMEBODY LISTEN TO IF YOU SAY NOW LISTEN TO ME AND LOOK ME IN THE EYE THE VISUAL SYSTEM WILL TAKE OVER AND THEY'LL SEE YOUR MOUTH MOVE BUT HEY'RE GONG TO HEAR THEIR THOUGHTS MORE THER HEAR WHAT WHAT YOUR SAYING CLOSING THE EYES IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO CREATE A CONE OF AUDITORY ATTENTION AND THIS IS WHAT LOW VISION OR NO VISION FOLKS DO THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS CAPACITY TO FOCUSS THEIR ATTENTION IN PARTICULAR LOCATIONS INCIDENTALLY DOES ANY ONE KNOW THET TWO ANIMALS THAT HAVE THE BEST HEARING IN THE WORLD THE ABSOLUTE BEST HEARING IMANY ORDERS IMAGNITUDE BETTER THAN HUMANS TURNS TOUT IT'S THE ELEPHANT THAT MIGHT NOT SURPRISE YOU THEY HAVE HUGE EARS AND THE MOTH WHICH PROBABLY WILL SURPRISE YOU I AVEN KNOW THAT MOTHS COULD HEAR BUT NOW I EXPLAINS WHETHER SO HARD TO CATCH IF YOU ARE NOT SITED YOU LEARN HOW TO DO THIS WITH YOUR HEARING IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO BRAILREADS YOU LEARN HOW TO DO THIS WITH YOUR FINGERS IF YOU LOOK AT GREAT PIANO PLAYERS LIKE GLENGOULD YOU'LL THEY OFTEN TIMES WILL TURN THEIR HEAD TO THE SIDE YOU THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE GREAT MUSICIONS THAT LIKE STEVIE WONDER THAT WERE BLIND RIGHT THYOU WOULD LOOK AWAY BECAUSE HE HAD NO REASON TO LOOK AT AT THE KEYS BUT OFTENTIMES THEY'LL ORIENT AN EAR ER ONE SIDE OF THEIR HEAD TO THE KEYS ON THE PIANO AS I MENTIONED BEFORE PEOPLE WERE NONSIDED HAVE BETTER PITCH SO WE HAVE THESE CONES OF ATTENTION THAT WE CAN DEVOTE AND FOR MOST PEOPLE VISION IS THE PRIMARY WAY TO TRAIN UP THIS FOCUS ABILITYING THESE CONES OF ATTENTION SO YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE THING THAT YOUR TRIN TA LEARN AN YOU WILL FEEL SOME AGITATION BECAUSE OF THE EPINEPHRONT IN YOUR SYSTEM IF YOUR FEELING AGITATION AND IT'S CHALLENGING TO FOCUS IN YOUR FEELING LIKE YOU'R NOT DOING IT RIGHT CHANCES ARE YOUR DOING IT RIGHT AND YOU CAN PRACTISE THIS ABILITY TO STARE FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME WITHOUT BLINKING I KNOW IT'S A LOERIE FOR PEOPLE TO WATCH BUT IF YOUR GOAL IS TO LEARN HOW TO CONTROL THAT VISUAL WINDOW FOR SAKE OF CONTROLLING YOUR FOCUS IT CAN BE AN IMMENSELY POWERFUL PORTAL INTO THESE MECHANISMS OF PLASTICITY BECAUSE WE KNOW IT ENGAGES THINGS LIKE NEWCLESPISALUS IN THESE OTHER BRAIN STEM MECHANISMS I GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT ATTENTION DEFIS AT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER T HT AND ATTENTION DEFISITE DISORDER SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE CLINICALLY DIAGNOSE EIGHTYTY AND EIGHTY HT AND IF YOU DO YOU SHOULD CERTAINLY WORK WITH A GOOD PSYCHOATRIS O TRANFIGURE OUT THE RIGHT PHARMOCOLOGY AND OR BEHAVIORAL PRACTICES FOR YOU MANY PEOPLE HOWEVER HAVE GIVEN THEMSELVES A LOW GRADE HT H T OUR GD D BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THEY MOVE THROUGH THEIR WORLD THEY ARE LOOKING AT THEIR PHONA LOT OF THE TIME IT'S ACHLY VERY EASY TO ANCHOR YOUR ATTENTION TOYOUR PHONE FOR THE FOLLOWING REASON FIRST OF ALL IT'S VERY RESTRICTED IN SIZE SO IT'S VERY EASY TO LIMIT YOUR VISUAL ATTENTION TO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BIG IT'S ONE OF THE O DESIGN FEATURES OF THE PHONE THE OTHER IS THAT JUST AS YOU YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS WELL A MOVY IS WORTH TEN THOUSAND PICTURES ANY TIME WE'RE LOOKING AT THINGS THAT HAVE MOTION VISUAL MOTION OUR ATTENTIONAL SYSTEM WILL NATURALLY GRAVITATE TOWARDS THEM IT TOWARDS THOSE MOVIES IT'S IHALLY MUCH HARDER TO READ WORDS ON A PAGE THAN IT USED TO BE FOR MANY PEOPLE BECAUSE WE'RE USED TO SEEING THINGS SPELLED OUT FOR US IN YOU TO VIDIOS OR VIDIOS WHERE THINGS MOVE AND ARE VERY DRAMATIC IT IS TRUE THAT THE MORE THAT WE LOOK AT THOSE MOTION STIMULEE THE MORE THAT WERE SEEN MOVIES OF THINGS AND THINGS ARE VERY DRAMATIC AND VERY INTENTS THE WORST WE'RE GETTING AT ATTENDING TO THINGS LIKE TEXT ON A PAGE OR TO LISTENING TO SOMETHING LIKE A PODCAS AN EXTRACTING THE INFORMATION SO MUCH SO THAT YOU I THINK MANY PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME A YOU KNOW WHY AREN'T YOU PROVIDING INTENSE VISUALS FOR US TO LOOK AT WHILE FRANKLY IT'S BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CONSUMING THIS CONTENT THROUGH PURE AUDITORY THOUS BY LISTENING AND I WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO DIGEST ALL THE MATERIAL BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE AREAS OF LIFE THAT DICTATE WHETHER OR NOT WE BECOME SUCCESSFUL IN DEPENDENT HEALTHY INDIVISUALS MOS ST OF THOSE INVOLVE THE KIND OF BORING PRACTICES OF DIGESTING INFORMATION ON A PAGE BORING BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS EXCITING IN THE MOMENT PERHAPS AS WATCHING A MOVI OR SOMETHING BEING SPOONFED TO US BUT THE MORE ATTENTION THAT WE CAN PUT TO SOMETHING EVEN IF IT'S FLEETING AND WE FEEL LIKE WERE ONLY GETTING LITTLE BITS IN PIECES SHARDS OF THE INFORMATION AS OPPOSED TO THE ENTIRE THING THAT HAS A MUCH MORE POWERFUL EFFECT IN ENGAGING THIS COLONERGIC SYSTEM FOR PLASTICITY THEN DOES FOR INSTANCE WATCHING A MOVY AND THAT'S BECAUSE WHEN WE WATCH A MOVI IT CAN THE ENTIRE THING CAN BE GREAT IT CAN BE AWSOME IT CAN BE THIS OVERRIDING EXPERIENCE BUT I THINK FOR ALL THOSE EXPERIENCES IF YOU'R SOMEBODY WHOSE INTERESTED IN BUILDING YOUR BRAIN AND EXPANDING YOUR BRAIN AND GETTING BETTER AT VARIOUS THINGS FEELING BETTER DOING BETTER ET CETERA ONE HAS TO ASK HOW MUCH OF MY NARROW CHEMICAL RESOURCES IN MY DEVOTING TO THE PASSIVE EXPERIENCE OF LETTING SOMETHING JUST KIND OF OVERWHELM ME AND EXCITE ME VERSE IS SOMETHING THAT I'M REALLY TRYING TO LEARN AND TAKE AWAY AND NOW THERE'S NOTHING I ENJOY MOVI CONTENT AND TEVY CONTENT ALL THE TIME I SCROLL INSRIM OFTEN BUT WE ARE LIMITED IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE CAN GRAB A HOLD OF THESE A SOA SEETOCOLING RELEASE MECHANISMS OR EPINEFFERON AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL THAT WE DON'T DEVOTE ALL OUR SEETO CALLING AN EPINEFRAN ALL ARE DOPOMINE FOR THAT MATTER TO THESE PASSIVE EXPERIENCES OF THINGS THAT ARE NOT GOING TO ENRICH US AND BETTER US SO THAT'S A LUBITIVIN OF AN EDITORIAL ON MY PART BUT THE PHONE IS RICH WITH MOVIES IT'S RICH WITH INFORMATION THE REAL QUESTION IS IS THE INFORMATION RICH IN FOR US IN WAYS THAT GROW US AND CULTIVATE SMARTER MORE EMOTIONALLY A YOUNWON'T WHAT MOTIONALLY EVOLVED OR A PEOPLE ORE IS IT CREATING IHOWS WHAT'S DOING FOR OUR PHYSICAL WELL BEING FOR THAT MATTER SO I DON'T WANT TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT TO DO ORE NOT TO DO BUT THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT HOW OFTEN YOUR FOCUSSING ON SOMETHING AND HOW GOOD YOU ARE OR POOR YOU ARE AT FOCUSING ON SOMETHING THAT'S CHALLENGING SO ONCE YOU GET THIS EPINEFRON THIS ALERTNESS YOU GET THEY SEETO COLLING RELEASED AND YOU CAN FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION THEN THE QUESTIONS FOR HOW LONG AND IN AN EARLIER POTCASA TALKED ABOUT THESE ALTRADYAN CYCLES THAT LAST ABOUT NINETY MINUTES THE TYPICAL LEARNING BOUT SHOULD BE ABOUT NINETY MINUTES I THINK THAT LEARNING BOUT WILL NO DOUT INCLUDE FIVE TO TEN MINUTES OF WARM UP PERIOD I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD GIVE THEMSELVES PERMISSION TAN NOT BE FULLY FOCUSSED IN THE EARLY PART OF THAT BOUT BUT THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT BOUT FOR THE MIDDLE HOUR OR SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN FOCUS FOR ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO SO THAT FOR ME MEANS ALIMINATING DISTRACTIONS THAT MEANS TURNING OFF THE WIFI I PUT MY PHONE IN THE OTHER ROOM IF I FIND MYSELF REFLECTIVELY GETTING UP TO GET THE PHONE I WILL TAKE THE PHONE AND LOCKET IN THE CAR OUTSIDE IF I FIND MYSELF GOING TO GET IT ANYWAY I AM GUILTY OF A GIVING AWAY THE PHONE UM FOR A PERIOD OF TIME OR EVEN THINGS MORE DRAMATIC OF A THROWN IT UP ON MY ROOF BEFORE SO I CAN'T GET TO IT TILL THE END OF THE DAY THAT THING IS PRETTY COMPELLING AND WE COME UP WITH ALL SORTS OF REASONS WHY WE NEED TO BE IN CONTACT WITH IT BUT I ENCOURAGE YOU TO TRY EXPERIENCING WHAT IT IS TO BE COMPLETELY IMMERSED IN AN ACTIVITY WHERE YOU FEEL THE AGITATION THAT YOUR ATTENTION IS DRIFTING BUT YOU CONTINUALLY BRING IT BACK AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT WHICH IS THAT AT TENTION DRIFTS BUT WE HAVE TO REANCHOR IT WE HAVE TO KEEP GRABBING IT BACK AND THE WAY TO DO THAT IF YOUR SIGHTED IS WITH YOUR EYES THAT AS YOUR ATTENTION DRIFTS AND YOU LOOK AWAY YOU WANT TO TRYING LITERALLY MAINTAIN VISUAL FOCUS ON THE THING THAT YOUR TRYING TO LEARN FEEL FREE TO BLINK OF COURSE BUT YOU CAN GREATLY INCREASE YOUR POWERS OF FOCUS AND THE RATS OF LEARNING WHICH IS ANCHORED IN ALL THE WORK OF MERCONA CUBAN WEASEL AN OTHERS NOW THAT'S THE TRIGGER FOR PLASTICITY BUT THE REAL SECRET IS THAT NERL PLASTICITY DOESN'T OCCUR DURING WAKEFULNESS IT OCCURS DURING SLEEP WE NOW KNOW THAT IF YOU FOC IS VERY HARD ON SOMETHING FOR ABOUT NINETY MINUTES OR SO MAYBE OU EVEN DO SEVERAL BOUTS OF THAT PER DAY IF YOU CAN DO THAT SOME PEOPLE CAN SOME PEOPLE CAN ONLY DO ONE FOCUS BOUT OF LEARNING THAT NIGHT AND THE FOLLOWING NIGHTS WHILE YOU SLEEP THE NERL CIRCUITS THAT WERE HIGH LIGHTED IF YOU WILL WITH THE SEETAL COLLING TRANSMISSION WILL STRENGTHEN AND OTHER ONES WILL BE LOST WHICH IS WONDERFUL BECAUSE THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF PLASTICITY AND WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT WHEN YOU EVENTUALLY WAKE UP COUPLE DAYS OR A WEEK LATER YOU WILL HAVE ACQUIRED THE KNOWLEDGE FOREVER UNLESS YOU GO THROUGH SOME PROCESS TO ACTIVELY UNLEARNIT AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT UNLEARNING AT IN A LATER EPISODE SO MASTERING SLEEP IS KEY IN ORDER TO REENFORCE THE LEARNING THAT OCCURS BUT LET SAY YOU GET A REALLY POOR NIGHT OF SLEEP AFTER ABOUT OF LEARNING CHANCES ARE IF YOU SLEEP THE NEXT NIGHT OR THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THAT LEARNING WILL OCCUR THERE'S A STAMP IN THE BRAIN WHERE THE SASETAL COLINE WAS RELEASED IT ACTUALLY MARKS THOSE SYNAPSES NOR CHEMICALLY AND METABOLICALLY SO THAT THOSE ARE SYNAPSES ARE MORE BIASD TO CHANGE NOW IF YOU DON'T EVER GET THAT DEEP SLEEP THEN YOU PROBABLY WON'T GET THOSE CHANGES THERE IS ALSO AWAY IN WHICH YOU CAN BUY PASS THE NEED FOR DEEP SLEEP AT LEAST PARTIALLY BY ENGAGING IN WHAT I CALL NON SLEEP DEEP RESS THESE ANNAS TOAR PROTOCALS BUT JUST ONE DISCUSS THE SCIENCE OF THIS THERE WAS A PAPER THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN SELL REPORTS LAST YEAR THAT SHOWS THAT IF PEOPLE DID IT WAS A SPACIAL MEMORY TASK ISHY QUITE DIFFICULT ONE WHERE THEYHAD TO REMEMBER THE SEQUENCE OF LIGHTS LIGHTING UP AND IF THERERE JUST TWO OR THREE LIGHTS IN A PARTICULAR SEQUENCE IS ZEASY BUT AS YOU GET UP TO FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN LIGHTS AND AND THINK NUMBERS IN THE SEQUENCE AHY GETS QUITE CHALLENGING IF IMMEDIATELY AFTER AND IT WAS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE LEARNING THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCE OF THIS TASK PEOPLE TOOK A TWENTY MINUTE NON SLEEP DEEP REST PROTOCAL OR TOOK A A SHALLOW NAPS TO LYING DOWN FEET SLIGHTLY ELEVATED PERHAPS JUST CLOSING THEIR EYES NO CENSORY IM PUT THE RATES OF LEARNING WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FOR THAT INFORMATION THAN WHERE THAT TO JUST HAD A GOOD NIGHTS SLEEP THE FOLLOWING NIGHT SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY CELERATE LEARNING WITH THESE ENASTY AR PROTOCALS OR WITH BRIEF NAPS NINETY MINUTES OR LAST SO THE KEY TO PLASTICITY IN CHILDHOOD IS TO BE A CHILD THE KEYS OF PLASTICITY IN ADULTHOOD IS TO ENGAGE ALERTNESS ENGAGE FOCUS AND THEN TO ENGAGE NON SLEEP DEEP REST AND DEEP SLEEP WHILE YOU ARE IN YOUR TYPICAL BOUT OF SLEEP I ALWAYS GET ASKED HOW MANY BOUTS OF LEARNING CAN I PERFORM WILL I KNOW PEOPLE THAT TRAIN UP THESE VISUAL FOCUS MECHANISMS TO THE POINT WHERE THEY CAN DO SEVERAL NINETY MINUTE BOUTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY IS MANY AS THREE OR FOUR AND SOME OF THEM ARE ALSO INSERTING NON SLEEP DEEP REST AS WELL AND THAT CAN GET PRETTY TRICKY A LOT OF PEOPLE FIND THAT THEY CAN RECOVER BEST FROM THESE INTENSE BOUTS OF FOCUST LEARNING BY DOING SOME MOTOR ACTIVITY GET WHERE YOU GET INTO SELF GENERATED OPTIC FLOW AND THAT SHOULD MAKE SENSE IF YOU'VE EVER HEARD ME LECTURE ABOUT STRESS WHICH HAVE DONE A LOBIT IN VERYS PODCASTS WHEN WE ARE IN A MODE OF SELF GENERATED OPTIC FLOW LIKE WALKING OR RUNNING OR CYCLING AND THINGS ARE JUST FLOATING PAST US ON OUR ON OUR RETNA WERE NOT REALLY LOOKING ANYWHERE IN PARTICULAR SO THIS AS THE OPPOSITE OF A TIGHT WINDOW OF FOCUS WHEN WE DO THAT THEIR AREAS OF THE BRAIN LIKE THE IMIGDULA WHICH ARE INVOLVED IN RELEASING EPINEFRAN AND CREATE ALERTNESS AT THE EXTREMES IT CREATES FEAR BUT CERTAINLY ALERTNESS THOSE ALL SHUT DOWN SO IT'S ITS OWN FORM OF NON SLEEP DEEP REST SO SOME PEOPLEL FIND IT MUCH MORE PLEASURABLE AND PRACTICAL TO ENGAGE IN A FOCUST BOUT OF LEARNING AND THEN GO DO SOME A ACTIVITY THAN INVOLVES WHAT WE WOULD SENTIALLY CALL WORDLESSNESS WERE YOU'RE NOT REALLY THINKING ABOUT MUCH OF ANYTHING AND SO FOR THOSE YOU THAT LISTEN TO AUDIOBOOKS OR PODCASTS WHILE YOU RUN YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER NOT THAT'S HOW YOU ON A SPEND YOURE YOUR TIME IU NOW ID LOVE IT IF YOU WERE LISTENING O THIS PODCAST WHALE WHILE YOU RUN OR CYCAL BUT I MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN YOU E ACTUALLY GETTING THE BENEFITS OF NERL PLASTICITY THAN JUST LISTENING TO ME FORSAKE OF LISTENING TO ME SO FOR MANY PEOPLE LETTING THE MIND DRIFT WHERE IT'S NOT ORGANIZED IN THOUGHT AFTER A PERIOD OF VERY DELIBERATE FOCUSED EFFORT IS THE BEST WAY TO ACCELERATE LEARNING AND DEPTH OF LEARNING AND THERE ARE GOOD SCIENTIFIC DATED TO SUPPORT THESE SORTS OF THINGS INCLUDING THE CELL REPORTS PAPER THAT I MENTION A FEW MOMENTS AGO I WANT O SYNTHESIZE SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE'VE COVERED UP UNTIL NOW THIS ENTIRE MONTH IS ABOUT NERL PLASTICITY TODAY'S EPISODE IS COVERED A LOT BUT BY NO MEANS HAS IT COVERED ALL OF THE POTENTIAL FOR NERL PLASTICITY AND PROTOCALS FOR PLASTICY WE WILL GET INTO ALL OF IT BUT TO DAY A WONT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE KEY ELEMENTS THAT FORM THE BACKBONE OF NERL PLASTICITY ARE REALLY EMBEDDED IN PEOPLE'S MINDS FIRST OF ALL PLASTICITY OCCURS THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPAND EARLY FROM BIRTH UNTIL TWENTY F IVE MERE EXPOSURE TO A SENSORY EVENT CAN CREATE PLASTESY THAT CULD BE A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING WE'RE GONG TO TALK ABOUT UNLEARNING THE BAD STUFF TRAMAS ET CETERA IN A SUBSEQUENT EPISODE THIS MONTH IF YOU WANT TO LEARN AS AN ADULT YOU HAVE TO BE ALERT MIGHT SEEM SO OBVIOUS BUT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT WHEN IN THEIR TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE THEY'RE MOST ALERT THERE FOUR EPISODES DEVOTED TO THAT TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE AND THE CYCLS OF ALERTNESS AND SLEEP I ENCURAGE YOU TO LISTEN TO THOSE IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO YET ORGUS ASK YOURSELF WHEN DURING THE DAY DO OUTYPICALLY TEND TO BE MOST ALERT THAT WILL AFFORD YOU AN ADVANTAGE IN LEARNING SPECIFIC THINGS DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME SO DON'T GIVE UP THAT PERIOD OF TIME FOR THINGS THAT ARE MEANINGLESS USELESS OR NOT A LINED WITH YOUR GOALS OF BE A TERRIBLE TIME TO GET INTO PASSIVE OBSERVANCE OR JUST LETTING YOUR TIME GET SOAKED AWAY BY SOMETHING THAT IS A VALUABLE ASSET THAT EPINEFERON RELEASED FROM YOUR BRAIN STEM IS GOING TO CUR MORE READILY AT PARTICULAR PHASES OF OF YOUR TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE THAN OTHERS DURING THE WAKING PHASE OF COURSE YOU SHOULD KNOW WHEN THOSE ARE AND THEN YOU COULD START TO THINK ABOUT THE BEHAVIORAL PRACTICES MAY BE THE PHARMICOLOGIC PRACTICS LIKE KAFFINE HIDRATION ET CETERA THAT WILL SUPPORT HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF ALERTNESS ATTENTION IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE LEARNED AND ATTENTION IS CRITICAL FOR CREATING THAT CONDITION WHERE WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU ARE ENGAGING IN WILL MODIFY YOUR BRAIN IN A WAY THAT YOU WON'T HAVE TO STHAN SO MUCH ATTENTION ON IT GOING FORWARD THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF PLASTHESY THAT THINGS WILL EVENTUALLY BECOME REFLECTIVE THE LANGUAGE THAT YOUR LEARNING THE MOTOR MOVEMENT THE COGNIVE SKILL THE ABILITY TO SUPPRESS IN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE OR TO ENGAGE IN E MOTIONAL RESPONSE DEPENDING ON WHAT YOUR GOALS ARE IN WHAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR YOU INCREASING A SITOCOLINE CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED PHARMICLOGICALLY THROUGH NICOTINE HOWEVER THEREAE CERTAIN DANGERS FOR MANY PEOPLE TO DO THAT AS WELL AS A COST FINANCIAL COST LEARNING HOW TO ENGAGE THE COLONERGIC SYSTEM THROUGH THE USE OF THE VISUAL SYSTEM PRACTICING HOW LONG CAN YOU MAINTAIN FOCUS WITH BLINK AS YOU NEED THEM BUT HOW LONG CAN YOU MAINTAIN VISUAL FOCUS ON A TARGET JUST ON A PIECE OF PAPER SET A FEW FEET AWAY IN THE ROOM OR AT THE LEVEL OF YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN THESE ARE ACTUALLY THINGS THAT PEOPLE DO IN COMMUNITIES WHERE HIGH LEVELS OF VISUAL FOCUS ARE NECESSARY NOW THE OTHER WAY TO GET HIGH LEVELS OF VISUAL FOCUS AND ALERTNESS IS TO HAVE A PANIC OR TO HAVE A SITUATION THAT'S VERY VERY BAD YOU WILL BE IMMEDIATELY FOCUSED ON EVERYTHING RELATED TO THAT SITUATION BUT THAT'S UNFORTUNATE WHAT WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE IS TRYING TO HARNESS THE MECHANISMS OF ATTENTION AND GET BETTER AT PAYING ATTENTION YOU MAY WANT TO DO THAT WITH YOUR AUDITORY SYSTEM NOT WITH YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM EITHER BECAUSE YOU'RE LOW VISION OR NO VISION OR BECAUS YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN SOMETHING THAT RELATES MORE TO SOUNDS THAN TO WHAT YOU SEE BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE THEY'RE TRYING TO LEARN INFORMATION COGNIVF INFORMATION OR THEIRE TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO HEAR THE NEW ANTS IN THEIR PARTNERS EXPLANATIONS OF THEIR EMOTIONALLY CHALLENGING EVENTS ET CETERA AND JUST REMEMBER BY THE WAY WHAT I SAID EARLIER WHICH IS THAT IF YOU REALLY WANT SOMEBODY TO LISTEN TO YOU AND REALLY HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND WHAT'S UNDER LYING IT YOU SHOULD NOT AND CANNOT EXPECT THEM TO LOOK DIRECTLY AT YOU WHILE YOU DO THAT THAT'S I SHOLD GEN A LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO FOCUS TURN O RESCUE A FEW FOKS OUT THERE WHO MIGHT BE IN THIS STRUGGLE I OF COURSE IT NEVER BEEN IN THE STRUGGLE AND THAT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE A JUNK I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT STRUGGLE BUT I KNOW THAT ONE CAN GET BETTER AT LISTENING ONE CAN GET BETTER AT LEARNING ONE CAN GET BETTER AT ALL SORTS OF THINGS BY ANCHORING IN THESE MECHANISMS W OF COURSE YOU CAN ALSO COMBINE PROTOCALS YOU CAN DECIDE TO COMBINE FOR FARMOCOLOGY WITH THESE LEARNING PRACTICES MANY PEOPLE IN COMMUNITIES DO THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE DOING THAT NATURALLY BY DRINKING THEIR COFFEE RIGHT BEFORE THEY DO THEIR LEARNING BUT I WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT HOW LONG THOSE LEARNING BOUTS ARE IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE EIGHD D WERE OR EIGHTY EIGH TY SEE A CLINITION BUT YOU SHULD ALSO ASK YOURSELF ARE YOU GIVING UP THE BEST PERIOD OF FOCUS THAT YOU HAVE EACH DAY NATURALLY TO SOME OTHER THING LIKE SOCIAL MEDIA OR SOME OTHER ACTIVITY THAT DOESN'T SERVE YOU WELL OR ARE YOU DEVOTING THAT PERIOD TO THE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN YOU SHOULD ALSO ASK YOURSELF WHETHER NOT YOU'RE TRYING TO FOCUST TOO MUCH FOR TOO LONG DURING THE DAY I KNOW SOME VERY HIGH PERFORMING INDIVIDUALS VERY HIGH PERFORMING IN A VER VARIETY OF CONTEXTS AND NONE OF THEM ARE FOCUST ALL DAY LONG MANY OF THEM TAKE WALKS DOWN THE HALLWAY SOMETIMES MUMBLING TO THEMSELVES ARE NOT PAYING ATTENTION ANYTHING ELSE THEY GO FOR BY CRIDES THEY TAKE WALKS THEY ARE NOT TRYING TO ENGAGE THEIR MIND AT MAXIMUM FOCUS ALL THE TIME VERY FEW PEOPLE DO THAT BECAUSE WE LEARN BEST IN THESE NINETY MINUTE BOUTS INSIDE OF ONE OF THESE ALL TRADIIN CYCLES AND THAT I SHOULD REPEAT AGAIN THAT WITHIN THAT NINETY MINUTE CYCLE YOU SHOULD NOT EXPECT YOURSELF TO FOCUS FOR THE ENTIRE PERIOD OF ONE NINETY MINUTE CYCLE THE BEGINNING AND END ARE GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT FLICKERING IN AN ATO FOCUS HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN ONE OF THESE NINETY MINUTE CYCLES IS STARTING WHAT TYPICALLY WHEN YOU WAKE UP IS A BEGINNING IN THE FIRST NINETY MINUTE CYCLE BUT IT DOES IT'S NOT DOWN TO THE MINUTE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TAP IN TO YOUR SENSE OF THESE NINETY MINUTE CYCLES AS YOU START TO ENGAGE IN THESE LEARNING PRACTICES SHOULD YOU CHOOSE AND THEN OF COURSE GETTING SOME NON SLEEP DEEP BREAST ORE JUST DELIBERATE DISENGAGEMENT SUCH AS WALKING OR RUNNING OR JUST SITTING EYES CLOSED OR EYES OPENG ON A MINDLESSLY IT MIGHT SEEM IN A CHAIR JUST LETTNG YOUR THOUGHTS MOVE AROUND AFTER A LEARNING BOUT WILL ACCELERATE THE RATE OF PLASTICITY THAT'S BEEN SHOWN AND QUALITY PEREVIEED STRUDIES AND THEN OF COURSE DEEP SLEEP AND SO WHAT WE CAN START TO SE Y IS THAT PLASTICITY IS YOUR NATURAL RIGHT EARLY IN LIFE BUT AFTER ABOUT AGE TWENTY FIVE YOU HAVE TO DO SOME WORK IN ORDER TO ACCESS IT BUT FORTUNATELY THESE BEAUTIFUL EXPERIMENTS OF HUBON WEASOL AND MERZONIC AND WINEBERG AND OTHERS POINT IN THE DIRECTION OF WHAT ALLOWS US TO ACHIEVE PLASTICITY ATPOINTS TO THE NEROW CHEMICALS AND THE CIRCUITS AND WE NOW HAVE BEHAVOURAL PROTOCALS THAT ALLOW US TO DO THAT I ALSO REALLY WANT EMPHASIZE THAT THERE'S AN ENTIRE OTHER ASPECT OF BEHAVIOURAL PRACTICES THAT WILL ALLOW US TO ENGAGE IN PLASTICITY THAT DON'T INVOLVE INTENSE FOCUS AND EMOTIONALITY BUT INVOLVE A LOT OF REPETITION SO THERE'S ANOTHER ENTIRE CATEGORY OF PLASTICITY THAT INVOLVES DOING WHAT SEEM LIKE ALMOST MONDANE THINGS BUT DOING THEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN REPEATEDLY AND INCORPORATING THE REWARD SYSTEM THAT INVOLVES DOPEMING SO TO DAY I TALKED ABOUT THE KIND OF PLASTICITY T COMES FROM EXTREME FOCUS YOU WOULD GET THAT EXTREME FOCUS AND ALERTNESS NATURALLY THROUGH A HARDER DIFFICULT EVENT THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT THAT'S THE KIND OF STINGER BUT YOUR BRAIN IS DESIGN TO KEEP YOU SAFE SO WANTS TO GET ONE TRIAL LEARNING FROM THINGS LIKE TOUCHING A HOT STOVE OR ENGAGING WITH A REALLY HORRIBLE PERSON YOU CAN GET INCREDIBLE PLASTICITY OF POSITIVE EXPERIENCES OF THINGS THAT YOU WANT BY ENGAGING THIS HIGH FOCUS REGIME AND THEN REST NOT SLEEP DEPRESTINCSLEEP AND THERE'S ANOTHER ASPECT OF PLASTICITY WHICHWE WILL EXPLORE NEXT EPISODE AS WELL AS WHEN WE EXPLORE MOVEMENT BASE PRACTICES FOR ENHANCING PLASTICITY AND PLASTICY OF MOVEMENT ITSELF AND THOSE ARE NOT OF THE HIGH ATTENTION CAN HIGH EMOTIONALITY OR IN THE INTENSITY OF THE EXPERIENCES THAT I DESCRIBE TO DAY THOSE ARE MORE ABOUT REPETITION AND REWARD AND REPEAT REPETITION REWARD REPEAT AND THEY ARE USED FOR A DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT CATEGORY OF BEHAVIOR AL CHANGE MORE OF WHICH RELATE TO HABITS AS OPPOSED TO LEARNING OF PARTICULAR TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT ALLOW US TO PERFORM PHYSICALLY COGNIVELY OR ADJUST OUR EMOTIONAL SISTEM SO ON A STOP THERE I'M SURE THERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS PLEASE PUT YOUR QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENT SECTION BELOW AND PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THIS ENTIRE MONTH WERE GOING TO BE EXPLORING NERAL PLASTICITYES OF THIS A DISCUSSION SLASH LECTURE AH I WISH IT WAS MORE OF A BACK AND FORTH BUT THIS IS WHAT THE FOREMAD OFFERS US SO PLEASE DO PUT

WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LANPONCAS  A SCIENCE SCIENCE TAE TO  MY NAME IS ANDREW HUBERMEN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE THIS POD CAST A SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING A RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AN EFFORT TO BRING U ZERO COSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TODAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS ATLETIC GREENS IS AN AL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASEN I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GRENS AN THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE O DAY IS THAT T HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOPMICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS I GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBIOCS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CAM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'L GIVE YOU FIV FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF WO'RE GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIEN INVITEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARDVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETI GREN STOCK CAM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIFRE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND PETASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR IAVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION END ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES IN ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AN POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY ND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLITES IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOC CAM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THERE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT DOK CM LASH HUBERMEN LET'S TALK ABOUT NERL PLASTICITY MORE SPECIFICALLY LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN OPTIMIZE OUR BRAINS NERL PLASTICITY IS THIS INCREDIBLE FEATURE OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS IT TO CHANGE ITSELF EVEN IN WAYS THAT WE CONSCIOUSLY DECIDE NOW THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE PROPERTY OUR LIVER CAN'T DECIDE TO JUST CHANGE ITSELF OUR SPLEEN CAN'T DECIDE TO JUST CHANGE ITSELF THROUGH CONSCIOUS THOUGHT OR THROUGH FEED BACK FROM ANOTHER PERSON THE SELLS AND THOSE TISSUES CAN MAKE CHANGES SURE BUT IT'S OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT HARBORS THIS INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO DIRECT ITS OWN CHANGES IN WAYS THAT WE BELIEVE OR WE ARE TOLD WILL SERVE US BETTER NOW TO DAY'S A REALLY SPECIAL EPISODE BECAUSE WHILE WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SCIENCE AND AS ALWAYS WE WILL DELVIN TO MECHANISM TO DAY'S EPISODE IS REALLY GEARED TOWARD ANSWERING YOUR MOST COMMON QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO LEVERAGE NERAL PLASTICITY THE PREVIOUS EPISODES WERE ABOUT FOCUS AND HOW TO ACHIEVE FOCUS FOR SAKE OF PLASTICITY AS WELL AS THE LAST EPISODE WHICH IS WHAT ARE SOME OF THE PORTALS INTO PLASTICITY THAT RELATE TO MOVEMENT HOW BEHAVIOR CAN ACTIVATE PLASTICITY AS WELL AS HOW TO ACTIVATE PLASTICITY FOR BEHAVE OURSELF HOW TO GET BETTER AT LEARNING CERTAIN MOVEMENTS TO DAY'S PODCAST IS REALLY DIRECTED TOWARD ANSWERING YOUR MOST COMMON QUESTIONS AND THE BIGGER THEME OF HOW DOES ONE GO ABOUT OPTIMIZING THEIR BRAIN OR EVEN THINK ABOUT OPTIMIZING THE BRAIN WHAT IS THIS THING THAT WERE CALLING OPTIMIZING THE BRAIN IN DOING SO I'M ALSO GOING A SHARE SOME OF MY TYPICAL ROUTINES IN TOOLS I DON'T SHARE THESE BECAUSE I THINK THAT THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE AVAILABLE OUT THERE CERTAINLY THEY'R NOT NOR DO I SHARE THEM BECAUSE I THINK THAT EVERYONE SHOULD DO THEM JUST AS I DO THEM CERTAINLY NOT I SHARE THEM BECAUSE MANY OF YOU HAVE ASKED FOR VERY CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF WHAT I DO AND WHEN AND SO I'LL SHARE THOSE WITH YOU AND YOU CAN DECIDE WHETHER NOT THOSE PROTOCALS ARE FOR YOU OR NOT EVERYBODY'S DIFFERENT BUT THERE ARE SOME COMMON FEATURES OF HOW WE ARE ALL PUT TOGETHER AT THE LEVEL OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AN BODY THAT DIRECT US TOWARD PARTICULAR PRACTICES PARTICULAR ROUTINES THAT CAN BE ESPECIALLY POWERFUL FOR NERAL PLASTICITY SO I WANT TO OPEN UP THE DISCUSSION TO DAY BY EMPHISIZING SOMETHING THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT WHICH IS THAT PLASTICITY IS NOT THE GOAL PLASTICITY IS NEVER THE GOAL PLASTICITY IS SIMPLY A STATE OR A CAPACITY FOR OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM TO CHANGE AND SO NOTHING MAKES ME MORE FRUSTRATED PERHAPS THEN WHEN I HEAR OH YOU KNOW THIS PILL THIS POTION THIS PRACTICE IT GIVES YOU PLASTICITY PLASTICITY IS JUST CHANGE THE REAL QUESTION IS WHAT YOU CHINO CHANGE AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT ENGOAL ARE YOU TRYING TO ACHIEVE SPECIFIC ENGOALS MIGHT BE EXTREMELY SPECIFIC LIKE YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO SPEAK A PARTICULAR LANGUAGE ARE YOU WANT TO LEARN AND NEW MOTOR SKILL ARE YOU WANT TO GET VERY GOOD IT CALCULOUS OR YOU'D LIKE TO FORGET THE BAD EMOTIONS RELATED TO A PARTICULAR HUMAN BEING OR EXPERIENCE OR CAN BE MORE GENERAL LIKE YOU'D LIKE TO BE MORE CREATIVE WHY SHOULD TALK ABOUT CREATIVE CREATIVITY TO DAY OR YOU WOULD LIKE TO ACHIEVE MORE FOCUS OR YOU LIKE TO BE LESS STRESSED SO I'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT PLASTICITY AND ACHIEVING PLASTICITY IS THE FIRST STEP IN WHAT WE CALL OPTIMIZING YOUR BRAIN YOU DON'T WANT YOUR BRAIN TO BE PLASIC ALL THE TIME IN FACT ONE OF THE MAJOR QUESTIONS ONE OF THE MAJOR UNSOLVE MYSTERIES OF NERO SCIENCE IS HOW EACH IN EVERY ONE OF US WAKES UP EVERY DAY AND NOWS WHO WE ARE WHY SHOULD THAT BE WELL THE BRAIN IS PLASTIC IT HAS A CAPACITY TO CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPEN BUT IT'S NOT SO PLASTIC THAT EVERY NIGHT WHEN WE GO TO SLEEP OR IN OUR WAKING THAT THE CONNECTIONS GET RECONFIGURED SO MUCH SO THAT WE FORGET WHO WE ARE HOW TO WALK OR HOW TO EAT IT'S A GOOD THING THAT WE DON'T HAVE SUCH ROBUST PLASTICITY OR ON GOING PLASTICITY THAT WE HAVE TO RESTRUCTURE OURSELVES EACH DAY IT'S PART OF WHAT GIVES OUR LIFE CONTINUITY SO REMEMBER PLASTICITY IS NOT AND IS NEVER THE GOAL THE GOAL IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ACCESS PLASTICITY AND THEN TO DIRECT THAT PLASTICITY TOWARD PARTICULAR GOALS OR CHANGES THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ACHIEVE AND I SHOULD JUST MENTION THERE'S NO RULE THAT IN LIFE YOU HAVE DO LEVERAGE THIS INCREDIBLE THING CALLED NEURAL PLASTICITY NO ONE SAID YOU HAD TO DO THAT THIS POT GAST AND THIS EPISODE IS PARTICULARLY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER HAPPY OR UNHAPPY WITH WHERE THE'RE AT WITH A PARTICULAR ASPECT OF THEIR LIFE AND THEY WANT TO SHIFT IT IN SOME PLOSITIVE WAY AND MANY OF YOU LISTENING MIGHT SAY   WOULDN'T EVERY ONE WANT TO DO THAT WILL ACTUALLY THERE ARE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE PRETTY GOOD WHERE THEY'RE AT AND THEY DON'T WNT TO CHANGE AND THAT'S TERRIFIC AND I I'M TIP MY HAT TO THEM AND I THINK THAT'S WONDERFUL IF EVER THEY DECIDE THAT THEY WANT TO LEVERAGE THESE PLASTICITY MECHANISMS THEY CAN'T AT ANY STAGE THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPAN LET'S START BY TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT SISTEMS WITHIN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR PLASTICITY AND IN DOING SO ALL FRAME THEM IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT I DO ON A DAILY BASIS ON A WEEKLY BASIS AND ON A YEARLY BASIS FIRST OF ALL THERE ARE SEVERAL FORMS OF PLASTICITY THEY HAVE NAMES LIKE LONG TERM POTENTIATION LONG TERM DEPRESSION WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH EMOTIONAL DEPRESSION BY THE WAY AND THINGS LIKE SPIKE TIMING DEPENDENT PLASTICITY THOSE NAMES ARE USE TO DESCRIBE CELLULAR PHENOMENON THE ACTUAL WAYS THAT THE SYNAPS AS THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NOUR ANTS CHANGE I'LL MENTION THOSE THINGS AND I'LL GIVE A LITTLE MORE MEAT AS TO WHAT THEY ARE AS I MENTION THEM BUT THAT'S PROBABLY NOT THE BEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT PLASTICITY IN TERMS OF OPTIMIZING YOUR BRAIN THE BEST WAY THINK ABOUT IT  IN TERMS OF SHORT TERM MEDIUM TERM AND LONG TERM PLASTICITY SHORT TERM PLASTICITY IS ANY KIND OF SHIFT THAT YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE IN THE MOMENT OR IN THE DAY BUT THAT YU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO HOLD ON TO FOREVER UNCS OF WHAT KINDS OF THINGS ARE THOSE WELL FOR INSTANCE SHORT TERN PLASTICITY MIGHT BE YOU WAKE UP EARLIER THAN YOU WOULD LIKE TO CATCH A FLIGHT YOU'RE NOT FEELING PARTICULARLY ALERT AND YOU WANT TO USE A PROTOCOL OR YOU DECIDE TO USE A PROTOCOL WHICH COULD BE COFFEE OR IT COULD BE A CERTAIN FORM OR BREATHING OR COULD BE SOME OTHER TOOL TO BECOME MORE ALERT AT A TIME A DAY WHEN NORMALELY YOU AREN'T THAT ALERT BUT YOURE EXPECTATION IS THAT WHEN YOU RETURN HOME YOU WILL DISCARD WITH THAT THE NEED TO DO THAT AT FIVE THIRTY A M BECAUSE YOU'LL BE ASLEEP AT FIVE THORTY M SO THERE SHORT TERM PLASTICY BEHAVIORAL PLASTICITY THEN THERE'S MEDIUM TERM PLASTICITY WHICH ARE CHANGES THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO MAKE I CALL THIS UM A WITH RESPECT AM AND A LITTLE BIT OF HUMOR RELIEAS MY CUNNI HUMOR I CALL THIS THE UM THE UNDER GRADUATE A PREMED PHENOMENON FOR THOSE YOU THAT HAVE WORKED WITH A PREMEDS AN HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR A MEDICAL STUDENTS AND PREMEDS THERE IS A A KIND OF A STERIO TYPE WHICH I DON'T A NECESSARILY AGREE WITH BUT THE STEREOTYPE IS THAT THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW FOR SAKE OF THE EXAM BUT THEY DON'T REALLY WANT TOKNOW THEY JUST WANT THE A AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S ALWAYS TRUE I'VE WORKED WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PREMEDS OVER THE YEARS AND AH THER'RE MANY OF THEM THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY A PASSIONATE ABOUT THE KNOWLEDGE ITSELF AND THEY ALSO WANTED THE A BUT THE PREMED PHENOMENON AS ITS DISCUSSED AMONG PROFESSORS AND T AS IS THAT THAT YOU KNOW YOU GOT THESE STUDENTS THEY JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW SO THEY CAN GET THE A RIGHT IT'S MEDIUM TERM PLASTICITY THEY DON'T ACTUALLY WANT IT TO BE IMBEDDED IN THEIR MEMORY TOO LONG OR ELSE THEY WOULD ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE INFORMATIONS THAT'S MEDIUM TERM INFORMATION AND SOMETIMES THAT'S USEFUL FOR INSTANCE IF YOU GO ON VACATION TO COSTERECA AND YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR WAY AROUND COSTERICK YOU WANT TO LEARN THAT DIFFERENT TOWN IN THE ROUTES THEYRE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY INTENTION OF GOING BACK ITS JUST MEDIUM TERM YOU WANTED TO PROGRAM IT IN FOR SAKE OF YOUR TIME THERE N THAN YOU WANT TO TI SCARDID MOST OF THE TIME WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OR TALK ABOUT OPTIMIZING THE BRAIN WHERE TIME BOUT LONG TERM PLASTICITY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE KINDS OF CHANGES THAT PEOPLE WANT TO MAKE SO THAT THEIR BRAIN REFLECTIVELY WORKS DIFFERENTLY THIS IS WHAT A CHILD DOES WHEN IT GOES FROM NOT KNOWING HOW TO WALK TO KNOWING HOW TO WALK DOESN'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT AFTER IT LEARNS HOW TO WALK IT BECOMES REFLECTIVE LONG TERM PLASTICITY IS ALMOST ALWAYS THE BIG GOAL IT'S I WANT TO KNOW HOW TO SPEAK THAT LANGUAGE I WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT SKILL I WANT TO BE ABLE TO FEEL THIS WAY WITHOUT HAVING TO PUT MUCH WORK INTO IT AND THERE ARE TOOLS AND PROTOCOLS THAT ONE CAN DO TO ACHIEVE THAT AND WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THOSE WEVE TALKED ABOUT A FEW OF THEM AND PREVIOUS EPISODES BUT I REVISIT THOSE PROTOCOLS TO DAY I'M IN A FRAME ALL THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DAILY LIFE THE WEEKLY LIFE AND THE YEARLY LIFE AND THAT'S BECAUSE NEURL PLASTICITY AND OPTIMIZING YOUR BRAIN RIDES ON A DEEP PER FOUNDATION OF THIS THING THAT GOVERNS PLASTICITY AN FIN FACT GOVERNS ALL OUR LIFE CALLED AUTONOMIC AROUSAL WHICH IS THAT WE'RE ASLEEP FOR PART OF THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE AND WE ARE AWAKE ALMOST ALWAYS IF WE PUSH OURSELVES IN STAY AWAKE WE'RE OKE WE CAN DO THAT FOR A NIGHT OR TWO BUT ALMOST ALWAYS WE ARE ASLEEP FOR A PORTION OF IT AND WE ARE AWAKE FOR A PORTION OF IT I'VE SAID IT BEFORE BUT I'LL SAY IT AGAIN THE TRIGGER FOR PLASTICITY AND LEARNING OCCURS DURING HIGH FOCUS HIG ALERT IN ESTATES NOT WHILE YOU'RE ASLEEP AND THE FOCUS AND ALERTNESS ARE BOTH KEEP BECAUSE OF THE NEROCHEMICALS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE STATES BUT THE ACTUAL REWIRING AND THE RECONFIGURATION OF THE BRIN CONNECTIONS HAPPENS DURING NON SLEEP DEEP REST WHICH WILL TALK MORE ABOUT AS ALWAYS AND DEEP SLEEP SO YOU TRIGGER THE CHANGE AND IN SLEEP YOU GET THE CHANGE SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WILL TALK ABOUT TO DAY ABOUT OPTOMIZING THE BRAIN OUR CENTRED AROUND NOT SLEEP BUT AROUND THE AUTONOMIC AROUSALL SYSTEM WE HAVE THIS SYSTEM OF NURONS IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY THAT'S JUST INCREDIBLE THAT WAKE US UP AND MAKE US ALERT AND WHEN WE'RE NOT ACCESSING THAT SYSTEM WELL WE CANNOT ACCESS PLASTISITY WE CAN NOT OPTIMIZE OUR BRAIN LIKEWISE IF WE CANNOT SLEEP WELL AND WE CAN'T REST WELL WE WILL NOT ACCESS PLASTICITY AND REWIRE OUR BRAIN BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THE ACTUAL CONFIGURATION BETWEEN THE CONNECTIONS OCCURS SO TO SET THIS IN CONTACT I WAKE UP EACH DAY AND I'LL BE TOTALLY HONEST I USUALLY DON'T FEEL LIKE BOUNCING RIGHT OUT OF BED I USUALLY DON'T FEEL COMPLETELY RESTED AND THAT'S NOT BECAUSE I DON'T GET ENOUGH SLEEP IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE I'M NOT TERRIFIC ABOUT TIMING MY SLEEP SO WELL NOW THIS MONTH ISN'T ABOUT SLEEP THAT WAS THE PREVIOUS MONTH BUT I REALLY WONT EMPHASIZE A FEW POINTS I WAKE UP GENERALLY MORE TIRED AND GROGGY THAN I WOULD LIKE BECAUSE I TEND TO GO TO SLEEP TOO LATE IT'S JUST OME INK THAT I DO I NOT TEND TO GET UP EARLY EITHER BECAUSE I SET AN ALARM BECAUSE I'VE THINGS TO DO OR BECAUSE I NATURALLY WAKE UP EARLY BECAUSE THE LIKE COMING IN AND SO FORTH WELL WHAT THAT TELLS ME IS THAT I'M PROBABLY SOMEBODY WHOSE NATURAL CIRCATIAN RHYTHM YOU MAY HAVE HARD OF CHRONOTYPE SEES ARE GUNETICALLY PROGRAM THINGS BUT CRONOTYPE IS SHORTER THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS IT MEANS THAT THE CYCLE OF WAKING AND ALERTNESS FOR ME IS PROBABLY SHORTER THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS WHICH MEANS THAT GETTING SOME LIGHT IN THE LATE AFTERNOON WILL HELP ME SHIFT AND MAKE MY CYCLE LILL BIT LONGER IT WILL FADES TO LAY ME IF THAT DOESN'T MAK ANY SENSE SEE AF PREVIOUS EPISODE BUT WHAT IT REALLY MEANS I'S GETTING SOME LIGHT INTHE AFTERNOON WILLALLOW ME TO STAY UP A LITTLE BIT LATER BUT WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT I'M NOT REALLY MATCHING MY HARD WIRED NEEDS OF GOING TO BED PROBABLY AT EIGHT THIRTY OR NINE AND WAKING UP AT FOR A M I TEND TO GO TO SLEEP AROUND TEN THIRTY ELEVEN LATELY AROUND ELEVEN THIRTY OR TWELVE AND THEN I WAKE UP AT SIX AND SO OF CORSE I'M IN A FEL GROGGY SO NORL PLASTICITY WILL ALLOW ME TO OPTIMIZE MY WAKEFULNESS BUT I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO ACTS US THAT THAT AND SOME OF YOU MAY ALREADY BE ANTICIPATING WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY WHICH IS ONO HE'S GOIN TO TELL US TO GET SUNLIGHT IN OUR EYES IN THE FIRST THIRTY MENS OF THE DAY I AM IN TO TELL YOU TO DO THAT BUT I'M AN ALSO TELL YOU TWO THINGS THAT I'VE HAVE NOT DISCUSSED BEFORE WHICH RELATE TO THE PLASTICITY BETWEEN THE MELONOPSEN CELLS THESE SUNLIGHT DETECTING BRIGHT LIGHT DETECTING CELLS IN OUR EYE AND THE CIRCADEIAN CLOCK I'VE NEVER SAID THIS BEFORE IN THIS PODCAST BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THESE MELONOPS AND CELLS IN THE CIRCADEAN CLOCK ARE PLASTIC THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPIN THERE'S A MASSIVE CONFIGURATION OF THE CONNECTIONS THERE AND A CELTYPE CALLED THE ASTROCITES WHICH IT ARE A GLEAL CELL ARE ACTIVELY REMOVING AND REENFORCING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE EYE AND THAT CLOCK EVERY DAY NOW THIS IS INCREDIBLE BECAUSE OTHER ASPECTS OF YOUR BRAIN THAT FOR INSTANCE A REPRESENT YOU KNOWING WHO YOU ARE WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING OR WHAT YOUR NAME IS ASSUMING THAT YOU'RE OLD ENOUGHTHAT OU'VE ALREADY LEARNED YOUR NAME WHEN THE FIRST THING KIDS LEARN IND SOMETHING WE RARELY EVER FORGET THOSE CONNECTIONS ARE CHANGING ALL THE TIME EVERY TWENTY FOR OUR CYCLE SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SHORT TURM CLASTICITY SO THAT'S WHY IVE U SUNLIGHT FIRST THING IN THE DAY HELPS ME WAKE UP THE OTHER THING THAT I DO IS THAT THERE'S A SIRKIT THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THE CIRCADEAN CLOCK AND ARE A DRENALS THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THAT TRIGGER'S THE RELEASE OF CORTESALL FIRST THING IN THE MORNING THAT WAKES US UP ESPECIALLY WHEN WE VIEW LIGHT SO IF YOU'RE GROGGI IN THE MORNING THAT'S WHY VIEWING LIGHT IS HELPFUL BUT THE INTERESTING THING IS IF YOU START VIEWING LIGHT FREQUENTLY IN THE MORNING THEN THOSE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE MELONOPS AND CELLS AND THE CIRCADEAN CLOCK BECOME PRIMED OR POTENTIATED WE WOULD SAY THEY BECOMES STRONGER FOR THE ANTICIPATION OF LIGHT AND YOU NATURALLY START WAKING UP EARLIER FEELING MORE ALERT SO WHAT THIS SAYS IS AND WHAT I DO IS I GET THAT REGULAR LIGHT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT SOME MORNINGS I'M JUST NOCK IN A FEEL VERY LERDALL FEEL ESPECIALLY TIRED AND I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO ACSES SUNLIGHT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY OVERCAST AR OM TRAVELLING OR SOME OTHER FEATURE BUT THE SYSTEM IS PLASTIC SO IT SHIFTED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION NOW IT WILL SHIFT BACK BECASE IT SHORT TURN PLASTIS EAFTER ABOUT TWO THREE DAYS SO YOU WANT TO TRY AND GET THE SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE ON A REGULAR BASIS THE OTHER THING THAT I DO IS I DELAY MY INTAKE OF CAFFINE FOR THE FIRST TWO HOURS THAT I'M AWAKE NOW IT THIS CAN BE VERY PAINFUL FOR PEOPLE BUT EARLI ARE WE TALKED ABOUT THE ADENICINE SYSTEM AND HOW THE ACCUMULATION OF A DENIZINE MAKES US SLEEPY AND CAFFINE SUPPRESSES A DENIINE IT MAKES US FEEL LERT BUT WE KNOW THAT IF YOU INGEST CAFFINE IMMEDIATELY ON WAKING THE SIGNAL TO THE ADRENALS TO RELEASE CORTISALL WHICH IS A HEALTHY RELEASE OF CORTIS ALL AND THE SUPPRESSION OF A DENIZINE THAT THAT A THAT HAPPENS AS WE COME OUT OF SLEEP WHEN DEP AND IN DEEP SLEEP THE SUPPRESSION OF A DENIZINE IF YOU INJEST CAFFINE TO EARLY THERE'S A MECHANISM BY WHICH THE ADENIZINE COMPETES TFORTHE RECEPTERS ET CETERA SO THAT YOU HAVE A MID MORNING CRASH BECAUSE IF THE IF KAFFINE THE WAIGT WORKS AS IF KAFFINE IS OCCUPYING THE A DENISINE RECEPTOR THEN THE NATURAL AND DOGENOUS MECHANISMS FOR SUPPRESSING THA DENISINE ARE NOT ACTHLG AN HAVE THEIR ACTION SO THE BRAIN TO A DRENAL AXIS IS SUBJECT TO PLASTICITY ALSO AND SO BY DELAYING KAFFINE UNTIL ABOUT TWO HOURS AFTER WAKING I'M ABLE TO CAPTURE AND REINFORCE TO POTENTIATE THE NURL CIRCUIT THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THE CIRCADEAN CLOCK AND THE QUART RS ALL RELEASE IN THE ADDRENALS AS WELL AS LEAVE THOSE A DENISINE RECEPTORS UNOCCUPIED SO THAT I CAN THEN USE THE KAFFINE TO GET A NATURAL LIFT IN ALERTNESS AND FOCUST TWO HOURS LATER AS OPPOSED TO USING IT JUST TO WAKE MYSELF UP OUT OF SLEEPINESS SO WHILE I'M SURE THERE ARE SOME IROLES OUT THERE IN SOME YONS BUT ONO IT'S THE SUNLIGHT IN THE MORNING THING AGAIN IT'S A POWERFUL TOOL FOR READJUSTING THESE CIRCUITS SO THES SHORT TURM PLASTICITY AND THE REASON FOR DELAYING KAFFINE FOR THE FIRST TWO HOURS OF THE DAY EVEN IF IT'S PAINFUL TO DO FOR THE FIRST COUPLE DAYS IS THAT THEN YOU NATURALLY START TO WAKE UP MORE READILY IN THE MORNING WITHOUT KAFFINE BECAUSE THE A DENISINE IS SUPPRESSED AND YOU DON'T HAVE THESE COMPETING I IT'S IN IT'S CALLED A COMPETING ANTAGONIST FOR THE A DENISINE RECEPTOR SO I WAKE UP I GET SUNLIGHT IN MY EYES LATELY BECAUSE I WAKE UP VERY EARLY I DO USE A BRIGHT LIGHT OM TO STIMULATE A ALERTNESS IT'S NOT ACTALLY DESIGN FOR THAT PURPOSE THAT'S JUST A LIGHT BOARD THATIS OF ABOUT NINE HUNDRED LUCKS AND THEN I DELAY KAFFINE SOME OF YOU HAVE ASKED AND AGAIN I'M NOT SAYING THAT ONE HAS TO DO THIS YOU KNOW WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU DRINK I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN BLACK COFFEE I JUST HAPPEN A LIKE BLACK COFFEE PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME ABOUT AND I DON'T WANT ANAME BRANNAMES HEREABOUT THIS TYPE OF COFFEE OR THAT TYPE OF COFFEE MIXED WITH THESE OTHER KINDS OF THINGS WILL THAT INCREASE FOCUS YOU KNOW WHERE CAN I IMEN A TALK TO DAY A LOT ABOUT THE USE OF OF DIET AND FASTING AND TIMING OF FOODS AND CERTAIN KINDS OF FOODS BUT TO BE HONEST BLACK COFFEE IS JUST AST SIMPLE CHOICE THAT'S ALWAYS WORK FOR ME I ALSO MAKE SURE A HYDRATE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING THERE ARE 'SPLENTY OF DATA NOW SHOWING THAT EVEN A SLIGHT INCREASE IN DEHYDRATION MEANING JUST WHEN YOU'RE LACKING WATER CAN MAKE PEOPLE HAVE HEADACHES IT CAN PROVIDE AND  SOME ADDITIONALPHOTOPHOBIA FOR THOSE YOU THAT ARE MYGRANE PRONE BRIGHT LIGHT CAN TRIGGER MYGRAINS THAT'S NO SURPRISE TO THOSE OF YOU THAT GET HEADACHES AN MYGRAINS BUT DEHYDRATION CAN CAN COMPOUND THE VULNERABILITY TO MYGRAIN AND HEADACHE SO I DRINK WATER I DRINK BLACK COFFEERE I DRINK MATE WHICH IS JUST A BECAUSE I HAVE ARGENTINE LINEAGE WHICH IS JUST A A HIGH KAFFNE DRINK FIRSTINGIN THE MORNING BUT I DELAY IT UNTIL TWO HOURS AFTER I WAKE UP AND THAT'S BECAUSE I WANT THE CIRCUITS BETWEEN MY EYE AND MY AND MY CIRCADEAN CLOCK AND MY ADDREANALS TO BE FUNCTIONING IN A PARTICULAR WAY SO THAT THEN LATER THE KAFFINE IS AN ADDITION IT ADDS MORE ALERTNESS NOW THIS IS HE DISCUSSION ABOUT HOT OPTIMIZE YOUR BRAIN MANY PEOPLE WHO WAKE UP QUICKLY AND JUST NATURALLY FEEL LIKE BOUNCING OUT OF BED I ENVY THESE PEOPLE THEY WILL DO JUST FINE BY GOING INTO A LEARNING BOUT OR TAKING CARE OF A WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY NEED TO TAKE CARE OF SOMETIMES THAT'S KIND OF MORE MUNDANE TASKS LIKE EMALE OR O AND WHAT NOT HERE'S A MORE O LESS A A RULE ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN FUNCTIONS VISO VI FOCUS LEARNING AND CREATIVITY AND I'M DISCUSS THIS MUCH MORE IN FUTURE EPISODES GENERALLY STATES OF HIGH ALERTNESS WHEN WE'RE VERY VERY ALERT ARE GREAT FOR STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION WHEN WE ALREADY KNOW HOW TO DO SOMETHING AND IT'S JUST UST SOME SIMPLY MATTER OF PLUGGING THE CORRECT ELEMENTS IN TO THE CORRECT BOXES THINGS OM I'VE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT DURATION PATH AND OUTCOME AS THE THREE THINGS THAT THE DELIBERATE CONSCIOUS BRAIN IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IN ORDER TO PERFORM CERTAIN TASK EVEN COGNO TASS THIS IS THE SORT OF THING THAT WE ARE VERY GOOD AT WHEN WE'RE WELL RESTED AND WE'RE FOCUS AND ARE AUTONOMIC AROUSAL IT ORAR LERTNESS RATHER AS IT IS AT A HIGH LEVEL IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO IS HITTING THAT ALERTNESS PHASE OF YOUR DAY VERY EARLY RIGHT AFTER YOU WAKE UP THAT'S A GREAT TIME TO MOVE RIGHT INTO THINGS THAT AT LEAST THE RESEARCH SAYS YOU ALREADY KNOW HAVE THE STRATEGYN YOU JUST ONE IMPLEMENT THE STRATEGY THIS IS WHERE I FUNDAMENTALLY DEPART FROM THE IDEA THAT OH YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO DO THE HARDEST OR MOST CRITICAL TASK THROUGHOUT THE DAY SOMETIMES THE HARDEST AMONGTS CRITICAL TASK ARE TASK THAT REQUIRE CREATIVITY AND AS WILL SOON TALK ABOUT CREATIVITY AND TASKS RELATATO IT OFTEN TIMES COME COME TO US BEST OR THE BRAIN IS BEST AT ACHIEVING THOSE WHEN WE ARE IN STATES OF CALM OR EVEN SLIGHTLY DROWSY WHICH IS SOMETHING IT'S INTERESTING IND WILL GET INTO BUT FOR ME FOR INSTANCE I GET UP I'M NOT TERRIBLY ALERT FIRST THING AND SO I TRY AND JUST GET MY BRAIN IN MY THOUGHTS ORGANIZED IT'S NOT A TIME FOR ME TO BE RESPONDING IN A VERY LINEAR FASHION TO EMALES OR CARRING OUT CALCULATIONS THAT COMES ABOUT TWO HOURS LATER I THINK I'M MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE WILL RELATE MID MORNING IS WHEN WE TEND TO WHEN MANY PEOPLE TEND TO ACHIEVE THEIR PEAK IN ALERTNESS AND FOCUS NO MANY TIMES I GET THE QUESTION AND THIS IS THIS WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE HUNDREDS OF QUESTIONS I GOT ABOUT THIS SHOULD I USE BACKGROUND MUSIC IN ORDER TO LEARN SHOULD I HAVE O MUNO CONSTRUCTION NEXT DOOR IS THAT A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING IS IT BETTER TO BE IN COMPLETE SILENCE ET CETERA NOW THIS WILL VARY SOME PEOPLE CAN TOLERATE THEIR OWN NOISE WITHIN THEIR HEAD MUCH BETTER THAN OTHERS OTHER PEOPLE FIND THAT HAVING SOME BACKGROUND NOISE HELPS CANCEL THAT OUT BUT THERE'S A SIMPLE RULE OF THUMB THAT ONE CAN USE BECAUSE AT LEAST MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES BACKGROUND MUSIC BACKGROUND NOISE IS VERY HELPFUL FOR ALLOWING ME TO FOCUS AND OTHER TIMES IT'S VERY DISTRACTING SO WHAT ACTUALLY GOVERNS THAT WELL WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHAT IS AT THE SORCE OF THE LACK OF FOCUS IF OUR LACK OF FOCUS IS BECAUSE OUR AUTONOMIC AROUSAL ARE OUR ALERTNESS IS VERY VERY HIGH WE HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH COFFEEER WE IF THERE IS SUCH A THING SLEPTALITTLE TOO LONG OR WE'RE REALLY STRESSED OR REALLY ACTIVATED AND WE CAN'T SEEM TO FOCUS IN THAT CASE ELIMINATING BACKROUND NOISE AND REALLY JUST TRYING TO GET SILENCE SO THAT WE CAN QUIET SOME OF THAT AUTONOMIC AROUSAL IS GOING TO BE BEST FOR LEARNING AND FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THINGS WE ALREADY KNOW HOW TO DO FOR ANY KIND OF FOCUS LINEAR TASK WHICH BASICALLY LEARNING IS A FOCUS LINEYAR TASKUS THAT YOU'ARE JUST NOT NASERELY PERFORMING IT WELL ALL THE TIME LAST TIME WE TALK ABOUT MAKING ERRORS SO AS A RULE OF THUMB IF YOU'RE FEELING TWO KEYED UP THEN SILENCE AND QUIET IS GOING TO BE HELPFUL IN FACT IF YOUR VERY KEYED UP A PATICULAR CIRCUIT RELATED TO THE BAZIL GANGLIA STARTS GETTING TRIGGERED MORE EASILY AND THE CIRCUIT WHI MEN A TALK ABOUT IN DEPTH BUT ITS CALLED THE GO NO GO CIRCUIT WE HAVE CIRCUITS THAT CONNECT OUR FOREBRAIN TO ITS STRUCTURE IN OUR BRING CALLED THE BASIL GANGLEA WHICH IS ACTUALY COLLECTION OF STRUCTURES AND THE FOREBRAIN WHICH IS INVOLVED IN RATIONAL THOUGHT AND THINKING AND PLANNING AN ACTION IS ALWAYS TRYING TO PLAN WHAT SHOULD I DO AND THEN IMPLEMENT THAT ACTION AND THE BASIL GANGLIA ARE INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN THAT DISCUSSION THRE'S A RECIPROCAL LOOP OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN BASIL GANGLIAN QUARTEX THE BAZIL GANGLEA HAS ONE SET OF CONNECTIONS TO THE QUARTEX AND THE QUARTEXS BACK TO THE BASIL GANGLIA THAT FACILITATES GO IF FACILITATES ACTION AND THE MOLECULE THE NERMODULATOR DOPAMINE TRIGGERS THE ACTIVATION OF GO IT TENDS TO MAKE US WANT TO DO MORE THINGS IT TENDS TO MAKE US BIUS TOWARD ACTION BY THE WAY THAT DOPAMINE BINDS TO SOMETHING CALLED THE D ONE RECEPTORS TOS THE PARTICULAR TEPTI DOPIMIN RECEPTOR FOR THOSE EITHER WANT TO KNOW THE NO GO PATHWAY THE PATHWAY IN THE BASIL GANGLIA AND QUARTEX THAT SUPPRESS IS ACTION IT INVOLVES DOPAMINE BINDING TO THIS OTHER RES EPVE RECALLED THE DETO RECEPTOR NOW D ONE D TO RECEPTORS YOU CAN'T JOUS CONSCIOUSLY TISID OH I ONLY WANT MY D ONE RECEPTORS OF MY D TO RECEPTORS BE T TO BE ACTIVE YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHICH SORTS OF STATES OF MIND AND BODY FACILITATE GO AND WHICH ONES FACILITATE NO GO NOW THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE DOING FOCUST WORK ACCESS IN PLASTICITY AND LEARNING INVOLVE DOING CERTAIN THINGS AND NOT DOING OTHERS SO HER'S HOW IT WORKS AND HEARS HOW I APPLY IT ON A DAILY BASIS BECAUSE I TEND TO BE MOST ALERT FIRST THINGMIDMORNING OR SO AND THEN I GENERALLY WI HAVE MY CAFINE MIDMORNING MY HOT PEAK OF ALERTNESS IN THE EARLY PART OF THE D AY IS OCCURRING FOR ME SOME TIME BETWEEN NINE THIRTY AND ELEVEN AM THAT'S JUST ME OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT EXPERIENCE THAT IMMEDIATELY AFTER ROLLING OUT OF BED THEY MIGHT BE WIDE AWAKE AND READY TO GO WHICH CASE THEYS SOURD BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THROWING CAFIN INTO MIX BECAUSE HAN ITS CAN MAKE THEM VERY VERY ALERT THERE' THREE SORT OF LEVELS OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL OF ALERTNESS THAT BIAS US MORE TOWARD GO NO GO OR BOTH AND THIS RELATES TO A QUESTION THAT I'VE GOT NOW HUNDREDS OF TIMES FROM YOU IN THE COMMENT SECTION FOR THIS PODCAST WHICH IS IS IT BETTER FOR ME TO LISTEN TO MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND WHILE I WORK AND LEARN OR SHOULD I HAVE COMPLETE SILENCE AND THE ANSWER IS IT DEPENDS BUT IT DOESN'T DEPEND RANDOMLY ON WHO YOU ARE OR EVEN NECESSARILY TIME OF DAY IT DEPENDS ON YOUR OVAL OVERALL LEVEL OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL AND IT DEPENDS BECAUSE AUTONOMIC AROUSAL LEVEL OF ALERTNESS BIASES THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE ARE MORE PRONE TO GOES TO ACTION OR TO NO GOES TO SUPPRESS ACTION AND DOPA MEAN IS THIS MOLECULE THAT SWIMMING AROUND AND IS GOING TO BIAS ONE OR THE OTHER RESPONSES SOR HERES OUT WORKS LET'S SAY I'M VERY ALERT MAYBE I GOT A PARTICULARLY GOOD NIGHTS SLEEP THE NIGHT BEFORE I HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH COFFEE AND I'M IN A SIT DOWN TO SOME WORK THE THING TO KNO AND WHAT I ALWAYS TELL MYSELF IS WHEN I'M VERY ALERT I AM VERY PRONE TO GO TO ACTION BUT I'M ALSO PRONE TO NOT NO GO RIGHT I'M NOT CAN BE VERY GOOD AT SUPPRESSING ACTION SO THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS BEING BUYAS TOWARD ACTION AND BEING BUYS TOWARD SUPPRESSING ACTION ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS MOKI SO THOSE PARE PUSHPULL TOWARD ACTION SUPPRESS ACTION SO WHEN YOU'R VERY ALERT THE TENDENCY IS FOR EVERYTHING TO BE A STIMULUS THIS IS WHY WHEN PEOPLE SAY WELL SHOULD I JUST TAKE A DRUG LIKE THAT WILL INCREASE MY LEVEL OF APINAFFRAN AND ALERTNESS WILL THAT HELP ME LEARN BETTER NO BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE YOU DO THINGS BUT IT WILL ALSO MAKE YOU LESS GOOD AT SUPPRESSING ACTIONS THAT YOU NEED TO SUPPRESS SO IF I'M VERY ALERT PARTICULARLY LERT FOR ME AND I RECOGNIZE WHAT THAT STATE IS OF COURSE CAUSE EVERYONE WILL BE DIFFERENT I KNOW WHAT IT IS FOR ME THEN I WANT SILENCE FOR LEARNING I WANT IT SHUT DOWN MY INNERNET WHICH I DO I SOMETIMES USE A PROGRAMM THAT I I BELIEVE AS A FREE PROGRAMM CALLED FREEDOM UM WHERE IT IT ACTUALLY LOCKS YOU OUT OF THE INNERNET FOR PARTICULAR UM TIME THEY'RE NOT A SPONSE FOR THE POCKKAS I JUST HAPPEN TO USE IT I'M THERE'S ANOTHER VERSION OR FREEDOM WHERE YOU GO TO THE WIRELESS THINGIN YOU TURN IT OFF YOU DISCONNECT FROM THE WIRELESS THAT'S THE OTHER ONE ALTHOUGH MANY PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME NOT REACTIV ATING IT SO I'M TRYING TO SHUT DOWN THE THE GO PATHWAY TOWARDS DISTRACTION AND THE OTHER THING THAT I'LL DO AS I'LL GENERALLY TURN OFF MY PHONE PUT THE PHONE OUTSIDE IN THE CAR OR IN REALLY EXTREME CASES I'LL PUT IT I'LL THROW IT UP ON THE ROOF WHICH IS HARD FOR ME TO RETRIEVE AS TO AT I CAN'T GET TO IT SO IF I'M VERY ALERT I'M AWARE THAT I WILL HAVE A BIAS TOWARD ACTION IT'LL BE HARD FOR ME TO SUPPRESS NONACTION BUT THAT IT'S VERY NON SPEACIFIC BECAUSE THE NEXT KIND OF LEVEL DOWN OF ALERTNESS OR AUTONOMIC ARAUSAL IS CLEAR CALM AND FOCUST WHERE WE HAVE THAT KIND OF SWEET SPOT BETWEEN OURE WILLINGNESS TO PURSUE ACTION WE'RE IN A MODE OF GO AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS PHYSICAL ACTION BUT IT CAN BE PURSUING HARD BOUTS OF LEARNING BUT THAT OUR ABILITY TO SUPPRESS IS ALSO VERY GOOD AND THIS IS BECAUSE AND I DON'T WAT TO GET INTO TOO MANY DETAILS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT DOPAMEN COMPETES FOR THESE DOPAMIN ONE RECEPTORS IN THE GO PATHWAY AND DOPAING TWO RECEPTORS IN THE NOGO PATHWAY THERE ALWAYS IN THIS KIND OF PUSHPUL AND SO THERE IS A SWEET SPOT AND THAT SWEET SPOT ISN'T FLOW WHERE IT IS IN SOME SORT OF STATE WHERE ALL T E SUDDEN THINGS COME NATUALLY TO US THE STATE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE THAT'S OPTIMAL FOR LEARNING IS ONE IN WHICH WE HAVE THE ENERGY AND FOCUS TO PURSUE BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE ENERGY AND FOCUS TO SUPPRESS ACTION SO THE BAZIL GANGLEAR CON O WORKING IN A PERFECT KIND OF SINGSONGY MANNER THROUGH THIS PARALLEL PATHWAY NOW AS WE GET TIRED OR AS WE ROUND OUT IN AL TRADY AN PSYCLE OF ABOUT NINETY MINUTES WHAT HAPPENS IS OUR FATIGUE EVEN IF IT'S NOT A PHYSICAL FATIGUE THAT MAKES US WANT TO GO TO SLEET BUT OUR MENTAL FATIGUE STARTS TO ACCUMULATE BECAUSE THESE PATHWAYS OF GO NOGO ARE ACTUALLY VERY METABOLICALLY CONSUMING SO WHAT I RECOGNIZE IS THAT AS THE START TO FALTER I HAVE A PARTER TIME ENGAGING AND GOING I ALSO KNOW OR GOING TOWARD THE GOAL RATHER I ALSO KNOW THAT MY REFLECTS TOWARD ACTIONS THAT ARE UNRELATED TO THE LEARNING ARE ALSO GOING TO START INCREASING BECAUSE I'E NOT AND BE ABLE TO SUPPRESS THE I'VE NOT TON BE ABLE TO SUPPRESS ACTION AND ACT TIVATE THE NOGO PATHWAY SO IF THIS ALL SOUNDS LIKE A MOUTHFUL LET'S MAKE IT VERY SIMPLE FOR YOU WHEN YOU ARE VERY ALERT THE BEST SITUATION FOR LEARNING IS GOING TO BE SILENCE IT'S GOING TO BE COMPLETE QUIET IF YOU ARE LOWEROUSAL AND YOU'RE TIRED IN YOUR KIND OF SLEEPY A LOT OF PEOPLE FIND THAT HAVING SOME BACKGROUND CHATTER IN SOME BACKGROUND NOISE CAN HELP ELEVATE THEIR LEVEL OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL AND THAT'S BECAUSE OUR AUDITORY SYSTEM IN OUR VISUAL SYSTEM ARE LINKED AND OURE PART OF REALLY AT WHAT'S CALLED THE SALIENTS NETWORK WHICH IS THAT WE'RE ALWAYS SCANNING OUR ENVIRONMENT FOR THINGS AND WHEN WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT TO SCAN GENERALLY OUR LEVEL OF ALERTNESS GOES UFP THIS IS WHY ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE VERY STARK OR HAVE VERY LITTLE OF OR VERY FEW OBJECTS IN THEM TEND TO MAKE US FEEL KIND OF CALM BECAUSE OUR SALIENTS NETWORK KIND OF SHUTS OFF LOT PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THAT THEY'LL GO TO A MEDITATION RESTREET RETREAT HERE THEY'LL GO INTO AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE IS VERY LITTLE COLAUTER ESPECIALLY CITY PEOPLE AND ALL SUDDEN THEY START FEELING REALLY REALLY ANXIOUS AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEIRE INTERNAL LEVEL OF AUTONOMIC ROUSALS REALLY HIGH AND IT'S NOT BEING OCCUPIED BY ALL THE STUFF TO PAY ATTENTION TO AND SO THEIR SALIENTS NETWORK STARTS TO TURN INWARD THEY MOVE FROM EXETEROCEPTION TO INTERROCEPTION THEIR OUTLOOKING OUTSIDE THEMSELVES THY LOOKING INSIDE THEMSELVES AND THRE'S A LOT ANOISE IN THERE SO AS A RULE OF THUMB IF YOU TEND TO BE KOND OF ON THE HIGH LEVEL OF ALERTNESS AND KIND OF ANXIETY ON AND I'MNOTIE MA CLINICAL LEVELS OF ANXCIETY BUT YOU TEND TO BE PRETTY HIGH ENERGY WELL THEN YOU ARE DEFENLY GOING TO BENEFIT MORE IN A LEARNING BOUT FROM LEARNING TO GO AS WELL AS ACTIVATE THE NO GO PATHWAY AN THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF ENERGY AND WE HAVE A LOT OF DISTRACTIONS IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT THERE'S A HIGH PROBABILITY THAT OU CAN BE DISTRACTED FROM THE LEARNING NOW SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST NACTUALLY MORE CALM THEY LIKE MY BULLDOG COSTELLO WHOIS EXCEEDINGLY CALM THEIR PRETTY MELLOW THERE KIND OF CLEAR COMMON FOCUS ALL OF THE TIME AND THOSE PEOPLE ACTULLY ARE GOING TO BE LESS FLAPPABLE THERE NOT GOING TO BE YANKED AROUND BY BACKGROUND NOISE ERE THEIR NOT TO BE ROUT YOU KNOW BOTHERED FROM THEIR LEARNING OR FROM THEIR STUDING BY A CLANGING OF A POT FROM SOMEBODY IN THE KITCHEN SO EACH ONE OF US GENERALLY TENDS TO RIDE UP AND DOWN THIS AUTONOMIC A LATTER SO TO SPEAK THAT DIFFERENT TIMES TO DAY FOM MOST PEOPLE THREE HOURS AFTER WAKING THOSE THREE HOURS T NOT THREE HOURS ON THE MARK BUT THAT THREE HOUR BEEN TENDS TO BE THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEIR MOST ALERT THROUGHOUT THE DAY EXCEPT I'LL TELL YOU LATER ABOUT A UNIQUE TIME RIGHT BEFORE SLEEP IN WHICH YOURE ALSO VERY VERY ALERT NATURALLY SO THAT MORNING THREE HOURS IS QUITE VITAL NOW MANY OF YOU MIGHT ASK ABOUT EXERCISE AND WHEN TO EXERCISE I THINK I MAY HAVE MENTION THIS ON A PREVIOUS PODCAST EPISODE BUT THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT AT LEAST FOR PERFORMANCE AFTERNOON EXERCISE MIGHT BE BETTER IN TERMS OF AVOIDING INJURY ET CETERA BUT IN TERMS OF RISING BODY TEMPERATURES THEY IT AND MATCHING BODY TEMPERATURE TO MENTAL LEARTNESS ET CETERA IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT EXERCISING EARLY IN THE DAY NOT ONLY BUYAS US US TOWARDS WAKING UP EARLIER BUT THAT IT ALSO TRIGGERS THE RELEASE OF THINGS LIKE APAN EFFERIN ANOTHER NROMODULATORS THAT LEND ITSELF TO A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF AROUSAL AND MENTALACUITY IN THE LATE MORNING AND EVEN INTO THE AFTERNOON THIS CAN BE VERY GOOD BECAUSE IF YOU ONE A RESTRICT MOST OF YOUR FOCUS LEARNING TO THE ERLY PART OF THE DAY EXERCISING EARLY IN THE DAY DOES SET A NURROW CHEMICAL CONTEXTR MILLYOU FORGO IT TENDS TO TRIGGER ACTIVATION OF THE GO PATHWAY AND SO FOR THOSE OF YOU LIKE MYSELF OF A HARD TIME COND OF ENGAGING AND GETTING INTO ACTION EARLY IN THE DAY EARLY MORNING EXERCISE WITHIN AN HOUR OF WAKING AND CERTAINLY NO LATER THAN THREE HOURS AFTER WAKING WE'LL GIVE YOU QUOTIN QUOT MORE ENERGY THROUGHOUT THE DAY IT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL MORE BIASD FOR ACTION YOU WON'T FEEL AS LETHARGIC SO IN KIND OF REVIEWING WHAT I'VE SET UP UNTIL NOW I DO THE MORNING LIGHTTHING I DELAY MY CAFFINE TWO HOURS AFTER WAKING AND THEN I GENERALLY TRY AND GET EXERCISE AND IN THE FIRST HOUR OR IDEALLY WITHIN THE FIRST THREE HOURS AWAKING UP AND THEN I'LL MOVE INTO A FOCUS LEARNING BOUT NOW SOME OF YOU WROTE TO ME IN SAID IF I EXERCISE EARLY IN THE DAY THEN I FEEL A CRASH AFTERWARDS IF THAT EXERCISES VERY VERY INTENSE AN YOU'RE DEPLEATING ALL YOUR GLACAGEN SO YOURE DOING HEAVY DEAD LIFTS ET CETERA CHANCES ARE AFTER YOU EAT YOU WILL TART TO FEEL A CRASH SO THIS RELATES TO TIMING OF NUTRITION AND IN JUST AS A GENERAL RULE OF THUMB FASTED STATES AND LOW CARBOHYDRATE STATES A' NOT TIKING ABOUT A A QUITO DIET ROUND THE CLOCK OR ALL WEAK BUT FASTED STATES AND LOW CARBOHYDRATE STATES LEND THEMSELVES TO A LERTNESS AND THAT'S BECAUSE CARBOHYDRATES ARE RICH IN TRIP TO FAN AND THEY TEND TO LEND THEMSELVES TO SLEEPINESS OF COURSE INJESTING LARGE AMOUNTS OF ANY KIND OF FOOD ANY SUBSTANCE THAT FILLS YOUR GUT WILL DIVERT BLOOD TO YOUR GUT SO IF YOU EAT A LOT OF FOOD REGARDLESS OF WITH A NONS A LOT OF CARBOHYDRATE OR NOT YOU'RE GOING TO GENERALLY FEEL MORE SLEEPY NOW MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING EVERYONE USE FOOD TO MODULATE THEIR LEVELS OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL AND TYPICALLY EATING SHIFTS US MORTS TOWARDS A STATE OF CALM AND FASTING SHIFTS US MORE TOWARD A STATE OF ALERTNESS AND THESE ARE HARD WIRED CIRCUITS THAT RELATE TO THE NEAD AND DESIRE TO FIND FOOD WHICH REQUIRES ACTION OR THAT SO CALLED IT REST IN DIGEST SYSTEM WHICH I DIVERTS OUR RESOURCES IN OUR ENERGY TOWARDS DIGESTION AND MAKES US FEEL CALM SO I PERSONALLY RELY ON WATER MATE AND BLACK COFFEE FIRST THING IN THE DAY IN ORDER TO EXERCISE AND GET INTO THE FIRST SURROUND OF WORK IF I FIND THAT I'M TOO ALERT AND THEN I GENERALLY WILL TEND TO EAT AND KIND OF BRING DOWN MY LEVEL OF ALERTNESS AND WILL CONTINUE WORKING NOW THIS ISN'T A STRICT THING AND SINCE PEOPLE ASKED ME WHAT I DO A AND I I'M NOT DICTATING THAT PEOPLE FOLLOW IT EXACTLY OF COURSE OR EVEN GENERALLY BUT I'LL JUST TELL YOU WHAT I DO IT IS POSSIBLE IF YOUR DRINKING BLACK COFFEE AND YOUR ORMATE AND YOUR INJESTING A LOT OF WATER THAT YOU 'ARE GOING TO DEHYDRATE YOURSELF SOMEWHAT BECAUSE OF EXCRETION OF SODIUM PROVIDED YOU DON'T HAVE HYPRETENSION SALT IS A REALLY GOOD THING LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT THEY ARE LOW ON BLOODSHURER BECAUSE THEYRE SHAKY AND THEY CAMP FHANK OR THEY HAVE A HEADACHE WHEN ACTUALLY THEIR LOW AN SODIUM AND ESPECIALLY F YERE DRINKIN A LOT OF CAFFI SO I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN SALT SO I DRINK SALT WATER FIRSTHING IN THE MORNING BECAUSE I DRINK BLACK COFFEE AND THAT KEEPS MY LEVELS OF A LERTNESS REALLY GOOD I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT I HAD MESSED UP BLOOD SUGAR A YOU SHAKY HANDS AND I DIDN'T KNOWHAT WAS GOING ON I'VE DRINK A LOBIT OF COFFEE AND FEEL TOO AMPED UP AND TURNS OUT THAT THIS IT WAS A SODIUM ISSUE AND IF I JUST DRANK A WATER WITH A LITTLE BIT OF OF SEASALT AND OR EVEN JUST GENERAL TABLE IT TYPICAL TABLE SALT THEN I'VE FELT ROCK SOLID IN TERMS OF MY BLOOD SUGAR NOW AGAIN I'M NOT A PHYSICIAN I'M A PROFESSOR SO I DON'T PRESCRIBE ANYTHING BUT I PROFESS LOTS OF THINGS SO I DON'T WANT OT PEOPLE HAVE DIABETES OR BLOOD SUGAR ISSUES TO YOU NOWT GO OFF THE RAILS YOURE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR HEALTH NOT ME BUT IT'S AN INTERESTING PERAMETER TO THINK ABOUT AND AND EXPERIMENT WITH YOU NOW PROVIDED YOUR DOCTOR SAYS IT'S SOKE BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE PROBABLY JUST TOO MUCH SODIUN BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT BE SODIUM DEFICIENT IN PARTICULAR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE FASTING I TYPICALLY EAT MY FIRST ME EAL RIGHT AROUND A MIDDAY UM WHEATHER NOT HAVE EXERCIZED OR NOT AND THE FOOD CONTENT THERE IS ACTUALLY QUITE IMPORTANT TO ME I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS IS I DON'T HAVE A SCIENTIFIC MECHANISM FOR THIS BUT IF I EAT HOT FOOD FOR LUNCH I GET SLEEPY AFTER LUNCH SO I GENERALLY DON'T EAT HOT FOOD FOR LUNCH I MIGHT HAVE A LOBIT A SUP OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT IN GENERAL I RELY ON A LOW CARBO HYDRATE MEAL I'LL EAT MEAT OR SALAD OR SOME VARIATION THAT AND UM NUTS AND FATS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE OF THE COLINE CONTENT FOR FOCUS BECAUSE THE PROTINE'S GOOD IN MY BELIEF AND BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN EATING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES I DO THAT TO IF I'VE EXERCISED VERY HARD EARLY IN THE DAY I DO IN JEST STARCHES LIKE O MEAL OR RISCERTAIN FRUIT IN THINGS LIKE THAT NOW WHY AM I TELLING YOU ALL THIS BECAUSE AM HUNDREDS IF NOT A THOUSAND PEOPLE ASK ME IS FASTING GOOD FOR FOCUS AND INDEED FASTING WILL INCREASE ALERTNESS BUT IF YOU'RE SO HUNGRY OR PREOCCUPIED WITH FOOD THAT YOU CAN'T FOCUS WILL THEN IT'S NOT CAN BE GOOD FOR LEARNING IT'S ONLY CAN O BE GOOD FOR AGITATION NOW I'LL I'M JUST GET A MARK CONTINUAL MARCH THROUGH MY DAY AND THIS IS OF COURSE A AT WHAT I EXPERIENCE SOME PEOPLE ARE QUITE DIFFERENT BUT WHAT I FIND IS A ROUND TWO OR THREE P AMAI ST AR GETTING A LITTLE GROG HE A LITTLE BIT SLEEPY I WILL TEND TO SHIFT MY WORK FROM WORK THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF DURATION PATH OUTCOME REALLY CAREFUL ANALYSIS AND ACTIVATION OF THE NOGO PATHWAY MEANING I'M TRYING TO SUPPRESS THE IMPULSE TO LOOK AT MY PHONE OR ANS WER EMAIL OR DO OTHER THINGS THIS IS WHY I HAVE AN EMELD YOU BACK UNTIL THREE IN THE AFTERNOON BY THE WAY A RESPONDED TO YOUR TEXT MESSAGES WHOEVER YOU ARE OUT THERE AROUND EARLY AFTERNOON I FIND I CAN DO KIND OF TYPICAL MOREMONDANE TASKS BECAUSE THOSE TASKS ARE REQUIRE LESS CAUHT THEY HAVE REQUIRE LESS COGNATIVE LOAD AND THEY CAN BE DONE MORE OR LESS IN AND OUT OF SEQUENCE I CAN ANSWER A COUPLEE MAL HERE MAY BE ANSWER THAT YOU MELL THERE I DON'T HAVE TO DO IT IN IMPURE LINE OR FASHION ANY KIND OF LINEOR WORK OR LEARNING WORK IS GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF FOCUS AND THEN TYPICALLY AROUND FOUR P M OR SO I DO TWO THINGS SOMETIMES A LITTE EARLIER SONE IS A LAYER BUT I DO TWO THINGS ONE IS I MAKE SURE I HYDRATE BECAUSE IF YOU'R EXERCISING AND YOUR EATING YOU NEED TO DIGEST THAT FOOD AT CETERA I MAKE SURE I HYDRATES SO I DRINK WATER I TRYING REFRAIN FROM DRINKING COFFEE IN THE AFTERNOON THIS IS A NEW THING FOR ME I SOMETIMES DO IT BUT I TRY REFRAIN FROM THAT AND THEN I ALWAYS DO AY NONSLEEP DEEP BREAST PROTOCAL SOMETIME IN THE AFTERNOON THIS IS SOMETIMES A TEN MINUTE YOGANIDURA TYPE PROTOCALL OR A THIRTY MINUTE YOGANITOR TYPE PROTOCALL THESE ARE PROTOCALS I HAVE NO RELATIONSHIP TO NO BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP TO WHATSOEVER I'VE BEEN DOING THEM FOR YEARS NOW THEY INVOLVE LISTENING TO A SCRIPT WILL PROVIDE THE LINX AGAIN ALTHOUGH WE REPRY THEM BEFORE OR I'LL DO A HYPNOSIS PROTOCAL FROM REVERY HEALTH WHICH IS MY COLLI GAVE ITS BEAGLES UM WEBSITE THAT HAS THESE FREE HYPNOSIS A APS OR A SCRIP PS THE YOU CAN LISTEN TO AND THOSE TAKE ME INTO A STATE OF REALLY DEEP REST SOME TIMES SO MUCH SO THAT I FALL ASLEEP AND I ALWAYS SET AN ALARMS THAT I DON'T SLEEP FOR LONGER THE NINETY MINUTES BUT TYPICALLY DISGOESES FOR ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES NI DO THAT BECAUSE FOR ME BY ABOUT FOUR THIRTY IN THE AFTERNOON I'M CAPABLE OF DOING BASICALLY NOTHING I AM JUST A COMPLET COSTELLO I CAN'T THINK I CAN'T DO I CAN'T RESPOND TH EMAIL I'VE JUST COMPLETELY TROUGH MY ABILITY TO FUNCTION I PERSONALLY FIND IT A MISTAKE TO THAT POINT DOWN A DOUBLE EXPRESSO AND CHARGE REALLY HARD IT JUST DOESN'T WORK FOR ME I AND UP REALLY DISTRUPTING MY SLEEP SCHEDUALAND ABDESTRUPTING A LOT OF DIFFERENT THING SO FOR ME I DO THE NONSLEEP DEEP REAST PROTOCAL IT REALLY HELPS ME LATER WHEN I NEED TO FALL ASLEEP IT HELPS WITH ALL SORTS OF THINGS M AS I MENTION BEFORE BUT I USUALLY EMERGE FROM THAT A LITTLE GROGGY OR FEELING LIKE I HAVE A ANOTHER WHOLE DAY SECOND WIN LIKE I COULD JUST WORK WORK WORK WORK WORK AND THEN I'LL DO A SECOND BOUT OF LEARNING I'LL DO SOME SORT OF WORK THAT EITHER INVOLVES LINEAR A MANALYSIS OF SOMETHING SO MAY BE NUMERICAL WORK OR I'M TRYN TO LEARN SOMETHING I GENERALLY TRY AND REALLY USE THOSE BOUTS OF NINETY MINUTE FOCUS ENERGY AFTER THE NON SLEEP DEEP REAST AS I' MENTION IND PREVIOUS EPISODES THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT THESE NON SLEEP DEEP REAST PROTOCOLS CAN ENHANCE IN E CELERATE PLASTICITY I THE MOST I THINK RECON AND OM STRIKING OF ONE IS THE STUDY THAT WE REFERENCE LAST TIME IN THE CAPTURE NOTES IS THE CEL PRESS ARTICLE OM SELL REPORTS CREAT JOURNAL WAS SHOWING THAT THESE TWENTY MINUTE O NOT A SHALLOW NAPS AND NON SLEEP DEEP REAST CAN FACILITATE SENSORY MOTOR LEARNING SO THEN I'LL GOINGTO ANOTHER LEARNING BOUT THAT'S CAFFINE FREE THIS LEARNING BOUT IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE THAN THE MORNING ONE THIS IS A WORK BOUT ER LEARNING BOUT THAT'S MORE IN THE CLEAR COMMON FOCUS REGIME BECAUSE I'VE COME OUT OF THIS NON SLEEP DEEP REST I'M NOT INJESTING KAFFINE BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I CAN SLEEP LATER THAT NIGHT REALLY WELL AND THIS TENDS TO BE MORE WHEN I DO CREATIVE TYPE WORK NOW CREATIVITY IS A TOPIC THAT WE'RE IN A SPEND THE ENTIRE MONTH ON A COMING UP SOON BUT CREATIVIT IS A VERY INTERESTING STATE OF MIND IN WHICH WE'RE TAKING EXISTING ELEMENTS THINGS THAT WE ALREADY KNOW AND REARRANGING THEM IN WAYS THAT ARE NOVEL ATS IT WILL DA THAT'S WHAT CREATIVITY IS BUT CREATIVITY HAS TWO PARTS IT HAS A CREATIVE DISSCOVERY MODE WHERE YOUR KIND OF SHUFFLING THINGS AROUND AN A VERY RELAXED WAY AND I BEING PLAYFUL OR EXPLORING DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS AND THEN CREATIVITY ALSO HAS AND ABSOLUTELY LINEAR IMPLEMENTATION MODE IN WHICH UTAKE THE THE IDEA OR THE DESIGN YOU'VE COME UP WITH AND YOU CREATE SOMETHING VERY ROPE ROBUSTING CONCRETE AND SO CREATIVITY IS REALLY A TWO PART THING AND THE FIRST PART OF ACTIVELY EXPLORING DIFFERENT CONFIGURATION SOMETIMES IN THE PL AYEFUL WAY SOMETIMES IN A AH IN A WAY THAT'S ALMOST RANDOM AN JUST KIND OF EXPLORING THAT STATE IS DEFINITELY FACILITATED BY BEING RELAXED AND ALMOST SLEEPY THAT IS NOT A STATE THAT I PERSONALLY CAN ACCESS VERY WELL EARLY IN THE DAY I'VE TRIED TO ACCESS AT COMING OUT OF SLEEP BECAUSE ONE WOULD SAY WELL YOUR STILL SLEEPY EARLY IN THE DAY AND JUST DOESN'T WORK MOST OF WHAT I WRITE DOWN MOST OF WHAT I DO IS COMPLETE GARBAGE AND SO WHAT I FOUND IS THERE'S THIS BLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON OF ABOUT NINETY MINUTES WHERE I CAN DO CREATIVE TYPEWRITING OR CREATIVE TYPE IMAGINATION OF A SCIENTIFIC IDEAS OR EXPERIMENTS WE MIGHT WANT TO DO SCIENCE MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE A CREATIVE ENDEAVOR TO ANY OF YOU BUT IT IS HAS A LOT OF IMAGINING WHAT IF THIS OR WE COULD COMBIN THAT AN THINKING OF NOVEL CONCEPTS OR WAYS OF ARRANGING THINGS SO WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF IN THAT KIND O CLEAR COMMON FOCUST MODE CREATIVE WORKS TEND TO COME ABOUT VERY WELL IN IN THOSE REGIMES I KNOW THE LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE RELY ON SUBSTANCES TO ACCESS CREATIVE STATES A I'M NOT A MERIUANTA USER IT'S JUST NOT THE DRUG FOR ME A FR VARIETY OF REASONS I'M NOT A DRINKER NOT NOT THE SUBSTANCE FOR ME FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS A YOU KNOW I'M NOT A COP I'M NOT NOW HERE TO TELP YOU WHAT THEY SHOULD DO OR SHOULDN'T DO THE PROBLEM WITH USING SUBSTANCES TO ACCESS CREATIVITY IS THAT GENERALLY THE ONES THAT THE SUBSTANCES THAT RELAX PEOPLE WE'LL LOW THEM TO GET INTO THAT CREATIVE BRAIN STORMING MODE BUT NOT SO GOOD AT THE LINEARUMPOMENTATION MODE A YOU KNOW THE OTHER DAY I WAS A REMARKING WITH A FRIEND THAT THERE'S SOME ADDS SOME ADVERTISEMENTS THAT I'VE SEEN OVER THE YEARS H THAT ARE JUST INCREDIBLE A I'LL JUST TELL YOU WHAT THEY ARE SO THAT'S NOT CRIPTIC AND DEM REVEALING MY TASTE HERE THERE'S A ONE THERE'S A PARTICULAR PERFUME AD THAT SPITE JONES MADE THAT IS JUST AMAZING IS JUS I'LL PUT A LINK TO IT CAUSE IS JUST SO COOL AND IT'S JUST SO AND AND IT HAS AN THERE'S I DONT WANT TO GIVE AWAY THE END BUT IT HAS A FEATURE OF IT THAT IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING TO ME AS A NARROW SCIENTIST A IT S SO COOL AND I I ECAUSE I GRO UP IN THE SCAPEBOARDING THING I KNEW LOBIT ABOUT SPIKES MOVIES AND SCAPEBOARDING ANIES OF COURSE MADE A LOT OF A VERY IMPRESSIVE A POPULAUR MOVIES AS WELL FUL LENGTH FEATURES A I DON'T KNOW HIN PERSONALLY S THIS AS AN A YOU KNOW PLUG NOT THAT HE NEEDS MY ENDORSEMENT FOR ANYTHING AT ALL BUT THE THE AMAZING THING ABOUT THIS ADVERTISEMENT IS IT'S A KIND OF IT'S A COLLECTION OF THINGS THAT YOU WOULD NEVER REALLY THINK WOULD BE COMBINED AND IT INVOLVES DIFFERENT SPEEDS OF MOTION AND IN ALL SORTS OF EFFACTS IM MING IT'S LIKE A REAL CLASSIC LIKE SPITE JONES KIND OF DELIVERY BUT WHAT'S INCREDIBLE IS ONT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT NOCCUST THE FACT THAT SOMEONE HAD TO IMAGINE THAT BUT TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE STEPS IN ORDER TO CREATE THAT WHEN YOU SEE THIS YOU'LL REALIZE THAT WAS A HAUN OF WORK YOU CAN'T JUST PUT THAT TOGETHER RANDOMLY AND SO A LOT OF PEOPLE NOT SPIKE CLEARLY BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO CAN WHO HAVE IN AN INCREDIBLE MIND FOR IDEAS AND NOVEL NOVEL ARRANGEMENTS OF THINGS THEY ARE GRAT AT ACCESSING THAT STATE BUT NOT SO GOOD AT ACCESSING THE IMPLEMENTATION STATE AND THEN THERE IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE AND SOME WHO TEND TO FALL ON WHAT WE WOULD CALL THE KIND OF LIKE MOR ASBERGERS AR OUTISM END OF THE SPECTRUM ARE VERY GOOD AT LENEAR IMPLEMENTATION NOT ON SELING ABOUT ALL FORMS OF AUTISM OF COURSE OM SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT THEARE MANY FORMS ON THE SPECTRUM BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY GOOD AT LINEAR IMPLEMENTATION AND THAT'S A SEPARATE STATE FROM CREATIVE STATES SO THAT AFTERNOON BLOCK AS WHEN I TRY AN ACCESS THE FRER KIND OF LOOSER MIND SET THAT'S ASSOCIATE WITH THE FATIGUE THAT COMES LATER IN THE AFTERNOON AND FOR SOME OF YOU THAT STATE THAT FAVOURS CREATIVITY AND CREATIVE LEARNING MIGHT BE BETTER IN THE MORNING I DON'T KNOW YOURE CAN HAVE TO DECIDE FOR SOME OF YOU YOU ARE GOING TO BE LATE SHIFTED SOME OF YOUARE GON BE MORNING SHIFTED BUT WHEARE WE HAVE ALERTNESS GENERALLY WE ARE GOOD AT LINEAR IMPLEMENTATION WERE GOOD AT ACTIVATING THE NOGO PATHWAY IN SUPPRESSING ACTION AND WE ARE GOOD IT AT PURSUING PARTICULAR GOALS AND AND STRATEGY IMPLMENTATION AND WHERE WE TEND TO BE MORE RELAXED WE TEND TO BE ALMOST IN A KIND OF SLEEPY MODE SO FOR ME COMING OUT OF ONE OF THESE NON SLEEP DEEP RESTMODES ARE OR SLEEP THAT'S WHEN WE TEND TO BE BETTER AT NOVEL CONFIGURATIONS OF EXISTING ELEMENTS WHICH IS CREATIVITY AND THIS BRINGS ABOUT A QUESTION THAT I GET ALL THE TIME WHICH IS WHAT ABOUT PSYCHODELICS SO I AM GOING TO TALK TO SOME EXPERTS ON PSYCHODELICS I HOPE TO BRING SOME OF THEM IN I TUALLY SPEAKING OF PEOPLE COMING IN OR CREATURES COMING IN A CREATURE THAT'S DEFFLING NOT ON PSYCHODELICS WHO DOESN'T NEED ANY IS COSTELLO AND HE JUST ARRIVED HE SEEMS TO BE IN A SLEEPY STATE MOST ALL THE TIME YBODY A DON YOU COME IN YE HE'S WORKING ON HIS FIFTEENTH SLEEP DEEP REST EPISODE OF THE DAY WHICH IS GENERALLY FOLLOWED BY A TEND TO TWELVE HOUR DEEP REAST EPISODES ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY COMPRISED OF REM AND I KNOW THIS CAUSE HIS EYES ARE OPEN CAUSE HEYRE SO DROOPY CAN'T CLOSUMALAWAY AND HIS EYES ARE GONE LIKE THIS AND HE'S GONE DOWN FOR THE COUNT S YE NICE BIGYON O K SO PSYCHODELICS FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR I AM NEITHER A PROPONENT NOR AM I SOMEBODY WHO REJECTS THE POTENTIAL ROLL OF PSYCHODELICS I DO HOWEVER THINK THAT PSYCHODELICS CAN BE PARTICULARLY HAZARDOUS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE PREEXISTING PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES AND ARE NOT WORKING WITH A BORD CERTIFIVED PSYCHAATRISTERPHYSICIAN AS WELL AS FOR EPSENTIALLY ALL KIDS I THINK THAT THE YOUNG BRAIN IS BASICALLY IN ITS OWN PSYCHODELIC STATE AND JUST NACTURALLY OM AND AT ALL KITTING ASIDE I THINK THAT THE YOUNG BRAIN IS SO SUBJECT TO NORAL PLASTICITY THAT DRUGS WHICH LIKE PSYCHODELICS WHICH ARE VERY POWERFUL CAN BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE DEVELOPING BRAIN THAT'S JUST MY STANCE IF ANYONE DISAGREES WITH ME I'D BE HAPPY TO CH T WITH YOU ABOUT IT IN A O IN A POLITE AND A DISCOURSE AL BE HAPPY E LISTEN AS WELL AS TELL YOU MORE WHY I BELIEVE THAT BASED ON THE DATA IM MENTIONING PSYCHODELICS BECAUSE MANY OF YOU ASKD HERE'S TE DEAL WITH PSYCHODELICS AT LEAST HEARE'S HOW THEY WORK IN A NUTSHELL PSYCHODELICS WE'RE THOUGHT TO UNLEISH SENSORY PROCESSING AND TO MAKE IT LESS FILTERED WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT IMPUTS FROM OUR EYES FROM OUR EARS FROM OUR KNOS FROM WHAT TASTE ET CETERA THAT YOURE COMING IN ALL THE TIME IN PARALLEL AND WE HAVE MECHANISMS THAT SUPPRESS SOME OF THOSE AND ALLOW US TO ONLY FOCUS ONE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING VISUALLY GENERALLY WE DON'T HAVE CYNESTESIAS UNLESS SOME OF US HAPPEN AV CYNESESIA WE DON'T BLEND WHAT WE SEE WITH WHAT WE HEAR IN A WAY THAT IS CONFUSING TOUS WE KNOW WHAT'S MAKING SOUNDS AND WE KNOW WHAT IS A VISUAL STIMULUS ON PSYCHODELICS PEOPLE REPORT BEING ABLE TO SMELL COLORS OR TO ON YOU KNOW HERE TREES ET CETERA AND THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF SENSRY BLENDING HOWEVER THAT'S LED TO THE MISCONCEPTION THAT SENSORY BLENDING ITSELF IS A CREATIVE PROCESS THERE'S NOTHING CREATIVE ABOUT SENSORY BLENDING THAT THERE'S THE ESSENCE OF A CREATIVE PROCESS IS THAT SOME NOVEL CONFIGURATION OF ELEMENTS WHETHER NOT ITS NOTES ON A PIANO OR WITHR NOTS WORDS ON A PAGE WHETHER NOT ITS NUMBERS OR WHITHER NOT ITS MOVEMENT THAT SOME WAY IN WHICH THOSE ARE CONFIGURED IN SOME NEW WAY THAT THE AUGARITHM THE WAY IN WHICH THEY ARE CONFIGURED MAKES SENSE TO THE OBSERVER AND THIS IS A KEYTHING IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHEN PEOPLE REPORT THEIR PSYCHODELIC EXPERIENCES IT MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE TO THE PERSON WHO EXPERIENCES IT THAN TO THE OBSERVER AND SO CREATIVE WORKS BY DEFINITION ARE NEW WAYS OF CONFIGURING THINGS THAT LEND THEMSELVES TO A BIGGER BIGGER OR GREATER OR DEEPER OR NOVEL UNDERSTANDING ON THE PART OF THE OBSERVER AND JUST SENSORY BLENDING IS NOT AN AN ACCOMPLISH THAT NOW IT IS TRUE AND THERE'S A GREAT REVIEW IN THE JOURNAL CELL EXCELLENT JOURNAL ABOUT HOW PSYCHODELICS WORK AND IT TURNS OUT THEY DON'T JUST WORK BY ALLOWING FOR MORE SENSORY BLENDING THEY DO BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THEY ACTIVATE CERTAIN CERETONIAN RECEPTORS ET CETERA THEY DO LEND THEMSELVES TO MORE LATERAL CONACTIVITY BETWEEN DIFFERENT BRAIN AIREAS MORE NOVEL ASSOCIATIONS SO INPRINCIPLE IN PRINCEBLUSHES A NONISARILIAN PRACTICE BUT IN PRINCIPLE THEY DO ALLOW DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE BRAIN MAYBEVEN THE TWO SIDES OF THE BRAIN TO COMMUNICATE MORE BROADLY THAN THEY WOULD NORMALLY SO THAT HAS CERTAIN ELEMENTS THAT SPEAK TO CREATIVITY BUT IT CAN'T SIMPLY BE THE CASE THAT PSYCHODELICS ARE THE PORTAL TO CREATIVITY BECAUSE CREATIVITY AS I MENTION BEFORE INVOLVES NOT JUST NOVEL ASSOCIATIONS AND A BREAKING OF KIND OF SPACETIME RULES IT ALSO INVOLVES RECONFIGURING THINGS SUCH THAT THE NEW SPACE TIME RULE THAT ONE COMES UP WITH IS INTERESTING STIMULATING AND KIND OF IN MANY CASES DELIGHTFUL TO THE OBSERVER AND THAT'S WHY MANY CLAIMS THAT YOUNO PSYCHODELICS OPEN PLASTICITY OR THEY INCREASE CREATIVITY THAT'S NOT SUFFICIENT FOR ME PERSONALLY I'M CURIOUS ABOUT DOES IT NOT JUST OPEN THE CREATIVE THINKING PROCESS THIS NOVEL CONFIGURATION PROCESS BUT DOES IT ALSO LEND ITSELF TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CREATIVE WORKS AND THE ANSWER IS NO IN MOST CASES IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH CREATIVE IMPLEMENTATION NOW I THINK THAT THERE MAY COME A TIME AND CERTAINLY THEIR CLINICAL TRHIALS THAT ARE HAPPENING NOW WHERE PSYCHODELICS ARE LEVERAGE TOWARD PARTICULAR CLINICAL GOALS AND I I WANT O SET MY HAT TO THE WORK AT JOHNS HOPKINS THAT'S HAPPENING NOW WHICH REALLY LENDS ITSELF OM TO THE IDEA THE EARLY PRELIMINARY DATA AND SOME OF THE PAPERS THERE COMING OUT THERE REALY FANTASTIC SHOWING THAT THERE MAY BE SOME O EXCELLENT ROLLS FOR CERTAIN PSYCHODELICS IN CERTAIN CLINICAL CONTECTS THESE ARE CLINICAL STUDIES DONE WITH AE PSYCHIATRIS PRESENT THAT IS AUTHORIZED TO DO THAT THAT CAN HELP PEOPLE THROUGH DEPRESSION TRAMA AT CETERA MORGAN A SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THAT INCLUDING WITH SOME OF THOSE THOSE FOKS RUNNING THOSE SDTUDIES S WE CAN LOOK FOR IT TO THAT SO ALL OF THIS IS TO SAY THAT NO I DON'T TAKE PSYCHODELICS TO ACCESS CREATIVE STATES THAT'S NOT WHERE I THINK THE MAJOR ROLL THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF PSYCHODELICS MIGHT SHOW UP IF IT'S GOING TO FOR HUMANITY I THINK THAT IT MAY HAVE THESE IMPORTANT ROLLS IN THE CLINICAL CONTEXT PROVIDED IT'S DONE LEGALLY AND SAFELY I THINK THAT THAT THE CREATIVE PROCESS BEING A TWO STAGE PROCESS MEANS THAT I AM PERSONALLY BEST SERVED BY HAVING THIS PERIOD OF NON LINEAR EXPLORATION OF CONCEPTS WHATEVER IT IS I HAPPEN TO BE WORKING ON IN THE AFTERNOON BUT THEN I'LL ACTUALLY SHELVE THAT WORK I'LL JUST SET IT ASIDE AND THEN I'LL REVISIT IT THE NEXT DAY OR EVEN THE NEXT DAY TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THAT THE WORK ITSELF IS READY FOR DELIBERATE LINEAR IMPLEMENTATION WHICH I WOULD WANT TO YOU DURING WHEN THESE HIGH HIGHLY FOCUSS STATES SO THE LONG AND SHORT WAY OF SAYING THIS IS THAT WHEN WE'RE VERY ALERT DO LINEAR TYPE OF OPERATIONS WHEN WE TEND TO BE MORE SLEEPY AND MORE RELAXED THAT'S WHEN CREATIVE WORKS CAN FIRST BE CONCEIVED BUT THERE IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRES HIGH LEVELS OF ALERTNESS NOW THAT GETS US MORE TO THE KIND OF LATE AFTERNOON EVENING NOW I AM AS IV MENTION BE FOR I'M A PROPONENT OF GETTING SUNLIGHT IN THE EVENING AS WELL THIS IS A CRITICAL THING THAT I HAVE NOT MENTIONED BEFORE HERE'S HOW IT WORKS MANY PEOPLE NOW HAVE HEARD ME SAY GETTING LIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY IS IMPORTANT BUT THAT WILL ADVANCE ONE'S CLOCK IT'LL MAKE YOU WANT TO GET UP EARLIER THE NEXT DAY BY GETTING LIGHT IN THE EVENING IT ACCOMPLISHES TWO THINGS FOR ME FIRST OF ALL IT MAKE SURE THAT I DON'T GET UP TOO EARLY THAT I'M NOT WAKING UP AT THREE OR FOUR IN THE MORNING BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO SHIFT MY CLOCK IT'S GOING TO DELAY IT A LITTLE BIT AND SO THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR SCHEDULE ON A NORMAL ROUTINE ON A REGULAR TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCHL AND NOT HAVE YOUR CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS OF SLEEP IN WAKEFULNESS DRIFTING ALL OVER THE PLACE AND YOU WANT SOME PREDICTABILITY TO HOW YOUR MIND IS GOING TO WORK IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE LEARNING IN PERFORMANCE WELL THEN YOU NEED TO GET MORNING LIGHT ANY EVENING LIGHT THE MORNING LIGHT IS GOING TO ADVANCE MY CLOCK MAKE MY SISTEM WANT TO GET UP EARLIER AND THE EVENING LIGHT IS GOING TO DELAY MY CLOCK A LITTLE BIT SO THAT ON AVERAGE IT KIND OF BOOK ENDS MY CIRCADIAN MECHANISMS AND I'LL BASICALLY WANT TO GO TO SLEEP AT MORE LESS THE SAME TIME EACH NIGHT AND WAKE UP MORE OR LESS AT THE SAME TIME EACH MORNING THAT'S HOW IT WORKS AND THAT'S A HARD WIRED MECHANISM THAT'S NOT SOME SUBJECTIVE THING THAT I TELL MYSELF THAT'S A HARD WIRED MECHANISM SO THAT GETS US TO THE EVENING AND GENERALLY IN THE EVENING I'LL GET THAT LIGHT BYK GOING OUTSIDE OR SOMETIMES I'LL DO IT BY TURNING UP ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS BRIGHTLY AND THEN I'LL START TO DIM THEM FOR THE EVENING CAUS AS A MENTION MANY TIMES BEFORE AND I'M NOT GKING TO BELABOR THE POINT YOU WANT O MINAMIZE YOUR LIGHT EXPOSUR ESPECIALLY OVERHEAD BRIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ITS BLUELIGHT OR NOT IN THE EVENING FROM ABOUT TEN P M DEFORE I M SOME OF YOU ASKED WAIT I THOGHT IT WAS ELEVEN P M DEFORE I M WELL IT IS BUT TEN P M DEFOUR I MS EVEN BETTER IT'S JUST THAT WHEN I ORIGINALLY SAID TEN P M TO FOR I M PEOPLE LIKE THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR MOST PEOPLE TO ADHERE TO SO FOR ME IT'S SCREENS OFF IT'S IM DIM LIGHTS AND THAT'S WHAT FAVORS A A FALLING A SLEEP IN A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP FOR ME SINCE WE'RE TIKE ABOUT FOOD EARLIER I'LL JUST REVISIT A LOTW BIT OF WHAT I SAID BEFORE MY EVENING MEAL TENDS TO BE MORE CARBOHYDRATE M RICH MORE BUT IF I HAVE PROTINES IOU'LL BE LIKE EGGS FISH OR OR CHICKEN OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT OR NO PROTINE AND I EAT HI CARBOHYDRATE SO I'M NOT ONE OF THESE PEOPLE THAT'S KEETO OR HI HI MEAT ONLY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT REMEMBER FASTING AND LOW CARBOHYDRATE STATES FACILITATE ALERTNESS CARBOHYDRATE RICH FOODS FACILITATE CALMNESS AND SLEEPINESS THEY'D STIMULATE THE RELEASE OF TRIP TOFAN IND THE TRANSITION TO SLEEP THATS WHY DOU THEM LATE IN THE DAY ALSO IF YOU'VE EXERCISED EARLY IN THE DAY ESPECIALLY IF IT'S WAIT BEARYING EXERCISE OR EVERYTHNGS WAIT VERY ECIZ US WAS ALESS OR AN ASTER NOT BUT AND YOU'RE IN SPACE BUT IF YOU'RE EARLY IN THE DAY EXERCISING WITH WAITS ARE YOU'REDOING A LONG RUN OR SOMETHING  SOONER OR LATER YOU NEED TO REPLENISH GLYCAGEN AND I REALIZE THAT THE KEETONISE DOES OUT THERE AGNST SAY WELL YOU KNOW GLICON GLUCONIOGENISIS WILL ALLOW YOU TO REPLENISH GLYKAGEN ET CETERA I'M JUST GOING TO CALL OUT THE LIE RIGHT NOW M BECAUSE IK FEEL LIKE DOING IT AND CAUSE I THINK IT JUST HASN'T BEEN STATED WHICH IS THAT IM NOT EVERYBODY BUT A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PROPONENTS OF HIGH MEAT KITO DIETS FINE THAT'S FINE IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AND AS YOU RECALL I DO RELATIVELY KEETOGENIC DIET DURING THE DAY TO FOR ALERTNESS OR FASTING BUT A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE CAN REPLENISH GLICOGEN REALLY WELL WITHOUT INGESTING CAR A HYDRATE SILL CALL GLUCONIA GENESIS AND INHANCE PROCENE SYNTHESIS BECAUSE THEY ARE HORMONE ENHANCED AND IT'S JUST THEIRE ABEEN AROUND AWHILE I KNOW WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE EITHER THIROID ENHANCED OR HORMON EN HANCS AND I DON'T PASS ANY JUDGMENT BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO LOOK AMAZING ON QUITO AND ARE ABLE TO HAVE A LOT OF ENERGY AND REPLENISH THEIR GLICAGEN ON QUITO THEY ARE IN MANY CASES NOT ALL BUT IN MANY CASES THEIR HORMON ENHANCS THEIR TAKING EXOCGION IS HORMONES THAT ALLOW THEM TO SYNTHESIZE AND REPARMUSCLE IND WAYS THAT PEOPLE WHO AREN'T TAKING THOSE EXOGENIS HORMONES CANT THIS IS NOT JUST TRUE OF THE MEN BY THE WAY THIS IS ALSO TRUE OF THE WOMEN AND THIS IS A WHOLE DISCUSSION ONTO ITSELF PROUBABLY NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO THIS MONTH OF THE PODCAST SO I DON'T MIND THAT PEOPLE DO THIS BUT ONE PROBLEM IS WHEN PEOPLE ARE FAUGHT FOLLOWING QUITOGENIC DIETS ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO SLEEP AND THEY HAVE TROUBLE WITH SLEEP OR THEYRE DOING LONG BOUTS TO FASTING N THEIR HAVING TROUBLE FALLING ASLEEP  MAKE SENSE IS BECAUSE THEIRE AUTONOMIC AROUSAL IS TILTED TOWARDS EPINEPRONRLASE NOR UP AN EFFERAN RELEASE AND DOPEMIN RELEAS SO THEYAVE A LOT OF ENERGY BUT THEYHAVE A HARD TIME CALMING DOWN AND GETTING INTO DEEP SLEEP I TEND TO ACHIEVE THAT STATE USING CARBOHYDRATES AND ET ALSO REPLENISHES GLIKAGEN SO AGAIN YOU KNOW NOT TRYING TO DRAWANY FIRE BUT IF I DO I'D BE HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION OM ABOUT ALL THAT AGAIN NO JUDGMENT BUT I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE NOT AWARE OF SOME OF THE OTHER VARIABLES REMEMBER GOOD SCIENCES ABOUT ISOLATING VARIABLES AND SO OFTEN TIMES WHAT WE'RE SEEING AND SOCIAL MEDIA IS WE'RE GETTING PRESENTED SINGLE VARIABLES AND WE'RE NOT SEEING THE FUL CONTACTS OF THE OTHER VARIABLES THAT ARE BEING MANIPULATED SO I EAT POSTON RICES AND VEGETABLES AND THINGS LIKE THAT THE EVENING ALSO I JUST FIND AMAYBE I'M BECOMING ONE OF THE LAST PEOPLE THAT DOES THAT ALTHOUGH I HOPE NOT I HOPE THEIR OTHERS OUT THEIR LIKE ME BUT I JUST FROM ALL THE LITERATURE SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT CABERHYDRATES NOT ONLY DO THAT BUT THEY ALSO HELP MAINTAIN HEALTHY THIROID FUNCTION ET CETERA SO THAT'S MY BICE THAT'S WHAT I DO I DO AVOID CAFFINE AND WHAT NOT IN THE EVENING I DO TAKE SUPPLEMENTS AND I'LL BE HAPPY AT SOME POINT TO PUT OUT THE COMPLETE LIST OF SUPPLEMENTS THAT I PUT OUT THAT TAKE OUT THERE BUT IN GENERAL THESE ARE THE COOR THINGS THAT I DO AND THEY RELATE TO A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THAT YOU'VE BEEN ASKING OVER A TIME THE NEXT PIECES OF SCIENTIFIC DATA THAT I'M GOING TO DESCRIBE IS A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF SCIENTIFIC DATA FORSAKE OF UNDERSTANDING HOW TO OPTIMIZE YOUR BRAIN AND ACCESS SLEEP IT ALSO CAN HELP AND AVOID A LOT OF ANXIETY ISSUES AND THESE RELATE TO DATA FROM CHARLES ICELER DOCTOR HES AN EMPTY CHUCKS ICEERS LAB AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOES RUN A SLEEP LAB OUT OF HARVOR MEDICAL SCHOOL FOR A LONG TIME NOW IT OS VERY IMPRESSIVE WORK WHAT HE'S SHOWN IS THAT THE PEAQUE OUTPUT OF THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK FOR WAKEFULNESS IN OTHER WORDS THE PEAQUE OF OUR WAKEFULNESS AND THE SUPPRESSION OF THE SLEEP SIGNAL ACTUALLY HAPPENS VERY LATE IN THE DAY SO WE HAVE THIS TROUGH OF ACTIVITY AND AND BODY TEMPERATURES LOWEST RIGHT BEFORE WAKING THEN AS WE WAKE UP OUR BODY TEMPERATURE GOES UP AND INTO THE AFTERNOON IT CONTINUES TO GO UP AND THEN IT TENDS TO FALL IN THE EVENING AND TOWARDS BEDTIME BUT THERE'S A BRIEF BELIP OF RELIESE OF PEPTIDES AND OTHER SUBSTANCES FROM THE FROM THE SLEEP CENTERS IN THE BRAIN AND THE SUPERCISMATIC NUCLYAS THA THAT SLEEP CENTERES THIS PREOPTIC AREA THAT IF YOU WANT TO LOOK THAT UP THIS PREOPTO CARRY AN NOT FAR FROM THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK THAT SIGNALS THE PEAK OF ALERTNESS IN WAKEFULNES ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE BEDTIME WELL THAT'S REALLY WEARD BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE GET INTO BED THEY'RE READY TO GO TO SLEEP AND THEI'RE WIDE AWAKE AND THEY THINK THIS IS AN UNNATURAL THING ORE THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM AND ACTUALLY IT'S NOT THIS IT'S BELIEVED OH NO AGAIN I WASN'T CONSULT THAT THE DESIGN PHASE BUT THIS IS IT 'S BELIEVED IS A SIGNAL THAT IS HELPFUL TO HUMAN BEINGS TO START GATHERING UP RESOURCES AND SECURING THEMSELVES FOR A NIGHT SLEEP DURING WHICH WE YOU KNOW HISTORICALLY WERE VERY VULNERABLE TO A TACK FROM OTHER HUMANS AND FROM ANIMALS AND SO FORTH AND SO THAT DESIRE TO RUN AROUND AND CLEAN THE KITCHEN ARE ORGANIZE THINGS OR JUST A GENERAL FEELING OF INTERNAL ANXIETY LATE IN THE EVENING THAT'S A NATURAL BLIP THAT NATURALLY PASSES AFTER ABOUT FORTY FIVE TO SIXTY MINUTES NOW THAT'S OFTEN THE TIME WHEN PEOPLE START STRESSING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO THE NEXT DAY AND THEY WORRY ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO SLEEP IN A CAN CASCADE INTO WHOLE SET OF THINGS SO ANOTHER THING THAT I DO THROUGHOUT MY DAY IS I KNOW THAT EARLY DAY I'M GIN TO BE ALERT AFTERNOON I'M GOINGTO BE KIN TO SLEEPY AND THEN AS THE EVENING COMES AROUND IN ADDITION TO DOING ALL THE OTHER THINGS IM I'M DOING I ANTICIPATE A PEIK IN ALERTNESS AND ACTIVITY AND I DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT I USE THAT PERHAPS TO GET ORGANIZED FOR THE NEXT DAY BUT TASICALLY I JUST GO THROUGH IF I'MN TO DO ANYTHING HIT CAN BE VERY MONDANE TASK LIKE CLEANING OR THINGS THAT REQUIRE ALMOST ZERO EFFORT IN THAT PROBABLY SPEAKS TO MY CLEANING ABILITIES TOO BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE DON'T JUST GO DRIFT OFF INTO SLEEP THERE'S THIS BLIP OF ALERTNESS RIGHT BEFORE SLEEP THAT I HOPE JUST COGNIVELY KNOWING ABOUT WILL BE HELPFUL TO PEOPLE AND THAT RAISES YET ANOTHER THEME THAT I THINK IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT WHICH IS PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS LIKE THESE CHANGES IN ALERTNESS OR USING BREATHING TOOL SOMETHING WILL TALK ABOUT IN FUTURE EPISODES TOO SHIFT OUR LEVELS OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL THOSE ARE CONCRETE BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENA SO IS FASTING FASTING WILL INCREASE ALERTNESS THAT WAY SO IS CAFFINE NOT EVERYBODY SUSCEPTIBLE THE CAFIN O THE SAME DEGREE OR OTHERS BUT IT'S A PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS WE KNOW THE RECEPTERS WE KNOW THE LIGANS AS THEY'RE CALLED WHICH BIND TO THE RECEPTORS WE KNOW THE MECHANISMS THEY AVE ALL QUARTERS ALL AN EPINEFFERON THOSE ARE THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT I PERSONALLY TRYIN LEVERAGE TOWARD MY LEARNING AND OPTIMIZATION OF MY BRAIN AND MY ACTIVITY DOING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY EARLY IN THE DAY FOR INSTANCE TENDS TO GIVE US A LONGER DURATION WAKE UP SIGNAL INTENDS TO ACCELERATE WAKING UP EARLY IN THE DAY SO I WORKING OUT LATE IN THE DAY CAN SOMETIMES CAUSE PEOPLE TO HAVE TROUBLE FALLING ASLEEP IT WILL ALSO FASE DELAY YOU MAKE IT SO THT YOU WANT A WAKE UP LATER THE NEXT DAY S NOT JUST CAUSE YOU'RE TIRED ITS CAUSE YOU'VE SHIFTED YOUR CLOCK WITH ACTIVITY AND TEMPERATURE MANY PEOPLE ASK ME ABOUT SUBJECTIVE TOOLS FOR PLASTICITY WHAT ABOUT VISUALIZATION YOU KNOW CAN WE JUST IMAGINE DOING A PARTICULAR ACTIVITY WILL THAT HELP US GET BETTER AT THAT ACTIVITY THERE'SE SOME EVIDENCE THAT VISUALIZATION CAN DO THAT IT'S TRUE UM BUT HERES THE IMPORTANT DISTINCTION AND HERE'S WHY I PERSONALLY DON'T DO MUCH DELIBERATE VISUALIZATION FIRST OF ALL I GET MY BESTABILITY OR ACHIEVE MY VESTABILITY TO VISUALIZE THINGS WHEN I'M IN KIND OF A SLEEPY STATE I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT THAT'S WHEN I'M ABLE TO DIRECT MY BRAIN TOWARD INTERNAL VISUALIZATION WITH MY EYES CLOSED AND GENERALLY I FALL ASLEEP AND I CAN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING THAN I WAS THINKING ABOUT BEFORE SOME PEOPLE AND THESE  WORK THAT WAS DONE MANY YEARS AGO BY ROGER SHEPHERD AND BY OTHERS A ROGER IS AT STAMFORD BUT AND OTHER LABS HAVE DONE THIS TOO OF COURSE OF ROTATING OBJECTS PHYSICALLY AND THEIR MIND AS A WAY OF IMPROVING OR LOOKING AT THE SPEED OF OF SPACIAL CALCULATIONS AND SO FORTH SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY GOOD AT VISUALIZATION THEY CAN CLOSE THEIR EYE AND THEY CAN JUST SEE OBJECTS AND ROTATE THEM DELIBERATELY ET CETERA A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE ME WHEN WE START DOING THAT OUR MIND DRIFTS TOO EASILY BUT I LIKE TO THINK I'M A REASONABLY FOCUSS PERSON IN THE WAKING STATE SO TVISUALIZATION HAS IT'S INTERESTING CAUSE I THINK PEOPLE ARE VERY ATTRACTED TO THE IDEA THAT THEY CAN JUST THINK ABOUT SOMETHING AND THEN GET BETTER AT IT THAT WAY AND IT'S PROBABLY TRUE IF YOU CAN BE VERY LINEER IN THE WAY THAT YOU VISUALIZE THINGS SO DON'T REPEAT THAT I THINK VISUALIZATION DOES HAVE CERTAIN POWER IF YOU CAN REMAIN VERY LINEAR AND DELIBERATE AND FOCUSED IN THE VISUALIZATION BUT MANY PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF WHO ARE CHALLENGED WITH MAINTAINING THAT LINEAR FOCUS WITH EYES CLOSED AND INVISUALIZATION THEY DON'T GET MUCH OUT OF VISUALIZATION AND I THINK THE DATE ON PERFORMANCE REALLY SUPPORTS THAT NOW THERE ARE EXAMPLES WHERE FOR INSTANCE O PEOPLEWILL INJURE ONE LIMB AND THEN THEY WILL EXERCIZE THE INTACT LIMB I OR THE  NON INJURED LIMB RATHER AND THEY WILL VISUALIZE THE OPPOSITE LIMB SOMETIMES THERE'S EVEN THE USE A MRROR BOXES SO THAT LETS TAY MY LEFT LIMB IS INJURED I'M A MAINTAINING ACTIVITY WITH MY RIGHT LIMB BUT I'M USEING A MIRROR BOXSO IT LOOKS LIKE MY LEFT LIMB IS F WORKING WELL YES THERE'S SOME TOP DOWN OR YOU KNO OR FEED BACK MECHANISMS THAT SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT THE INJURED LIMB CAN REHABILITATE MORE QUICKLY ET CETERA BUT THOSE ARE FAIRLY ELABORATE SCHEMES THESE AREN'T THE KINDS I DON'T A MIRROBOXES AROUND MY HOUSE I I THINK THESE ARE ARE SPECIALIZED CIRCUMSTANCES THEY'RE LITTLE BIT LIKE THE THE EXAMPLES THAT WE SEE IN THE NEWS WHERE OH SO ANSO HAS A STROKE AND THEN SPONTANEOUSLY SPEAEKS A NEW LANGUAGE I I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER TO THAT IS A I IT SHOWS THAT THE BRAIN HAS A SOCIAT OV NETWORKS THAT ARE TYPICALLY SUPPRESSED IN THOSE CAN BE UNLEASHED BUT  YOU CERTAINLY DO'T WAN TO GO OUT AND GIVE YOURSELF A STROKE DELIBERATELY TO TRYIN UNMAST SOME SKILL AM BECAUSE THERE'S JUST NO A THERE'S NO CONCRETE WAY TO GO ABOUT THAT IN A WAY THAT YOU COULD REALLY KNOW THAT YOU RE AN OFFSET THET DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF THE STROKE IF I TO THNG TO BE A TERRIBLE IDEA SO I THINK WHAT I'M TRYING TO DESTRIVE IS HOW I TYPICAL I DON'T KNOW IF I'M TYPICAL OR NORMAL I MEAN THAVE BEEN TOLD OTHER WISE AM IS CERTAINLY NOT NORMAL BUT IN TERMS OF THE WAY THAT I STRUCTURE MY DAY I THINK THAT'S NORMAL THAT'S PRETTY NORMAL I TEND TO WAKE UP RIGHT AROUND I DON'TKNOW SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIVE THIRTY AND SEVEN AM DEPENDING ON WHAT I BEEN DOING THE IGHT BEFORE I TEND TO GO TO SLEEP SOMEWHERE AROUND TEN THIRTY ELEVEN I TEN TO HAVE ONE BOUT IN THE MORNING WHERE I CAN DO REALLY FOCUSSED HARD WORK AND I CAN REALLY ACTIVATE THE GO PATHWAY WHILE ALSO ACT OFEING THE NOGO PATHWAYS THAT I CAN REALLY STAY FOCUS BUT I RELY IN SOME TOOLS I HAVE A PERIOD IN THE AFTERNON WHERE I GET SLEEPY GONT A OUT OF IT LIKE I THINK MOST PEOPLE AND I TEND TO COME OUT OF THAT WITH AN OPRECOGNIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF THAT SLIGHTLY SLEEPY STATE FOR CREATIVE WORK AND FOR THINKING ABOUT THINGS IN NOVEL WAYS I GET LIGHT COUPLE TIMES A DAY I LOW CARVE DURING THE DAY AND I EAT I DON'T SA HIGH BUT YOU KNOW HIGHER CARB BY EAT STARCHES UM IN THE EVENING THO SO IN THE WAY I CAN SLEEP AND THEN I REALLY ANTICIPATE THAT LATE AFTERNOON PEIK AN ALERTNESS EXCUSE ME LATE NIGHTE PEAK AN ALERTNESS THAT MANY PEOPLE CONFUSE FOR IN SOMNIA OR CHALLENGE IS WHEN ACTUALLY THERE REALLY QUITE NORMAL IN THEIR CIRCADIAN CYCLE AND THEN I FALL ASLEEP AND IF ALL GOES WELL I STAY ASLEEP FOR FOR FIVE HOURS TYPICALLY ITS THREE OR FOUR AND THEN I WAKE UP I THINK I'M LIKE MOST PEOPLE I WAKE UP DURING THE MILL THE NIGHT NOW ONE THING THAT I DON'T THINK HAS BEEN DISCUSSED THE LOT BUT THAT ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES AT THE STAMFORD SLEEP LAB TELLS ME IS THAT EVERY HOUR AND A HALF OR SO WE ALL WAKE UP SOME OF YOU EVEN LOOK AROUND BELIEVE IT OR NOT AND GO RIGHT BACK TO SLEEP AND YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE IT WAKING UP PERIODICALLY DURING SLEEP IS THE NORM IT IS NOT ABNORMAL I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS IS BEEN DISCUSSED MORE PROMINENTLY I TEND TO WAKE UP AND IF THERE'S A BRIGHT LIGHT COMING THROUGH THE BLINDS OR IF THERE'S SOME NOISE UPSTAIRS IF COSTELLA SNORING PARTICULARLY LOUD I MIGHT GET UP I MIGHT GO USE THE REST ARUM I MIGHT A YOU KNOW PICK UP A BOOK AND READ UNDER LOW LIGHT OR SOMETHING AND THE I GENERALLY FALL BACK ASLEEP AND WAKE UP TYPICAL TIME FOR ME AGAIN FIVE THIRTY SEVEN A M IN THE MORNING THIS WAKING UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THING AS I MENTION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PODCAST EPISODE TO DAY IS NOT NECESSARILY ABNORMAL WHAT IT PROBABLY REFLECTS IS THAT THE REAL TIME MEANING THE TIME THAT I SHOULD GO TO SLEEP IS PROBABLY CLOSER TO EIGHT O'CLOCK THE WORD MIDNIGHT WAS LITERALLY SPPOSE TO MEAN MID NIGHT WE MANY MEANING ALL OF US WE'RE MEANT TO GO TO SLEEP AND WAKE UP WITH THE RISE YOU KNOW WITH THE SETTING AND RISING IN THE SUN AND WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE THERE'S BEAUTIFUL STUDY FROM UNIVERSEA COLORADO WHERE THEY TOOK PEOPLE OUT INTO THE WILDERNESS TO RESET THEIR CIRCADEAN CLOCKS BY WAY OF A YOU MEASURED BY WAY OF A MELETONAN AND CARTES ALL AND THEY HAD THEM THEY WERE COMPLETELY AUT A WACK FROM INTERACTING WIT SCREENS AND STAYING UP TOO LATE AT CETERA AND THEY BASICALLY HAD THEM VIEW THE SUNRISE AND VIEW THE SUNSET ACH EVENING AND ALMOST ALL THE NOT ALL OF THE STUDENTS BUT ALL OF THEM GOT ON TO A SCHADUL WHERE THEY NATURALLY WANTED TO GO TO SLEEP AT SUNSET AND WAKE UP AROUND SUNRISER JUST BEFORE SUNRISE EVEN WHEN THEY WERE BROUGHT BACK IN TO A NORMAL ARTIFICIAL LIGHT SETTING SO I THINK THAT'S THE NATURAL PATTERN AND WE'VE JUST DEVIATED FROM IT WITH ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS SO WAKING UP AT THREE A M OR FOR M DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THERE SOMETHING SCREWED UP ABOUT YOU IT OR THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ANXIETY OR SOMETHING ALTHOUGH YOU MIGHT THE WHAT IT LIKELY MEANS IS THAT YOU ARESUPPOSED TO GO TO BED MUCH EARLIER AND BECAUSE OF THIS A SYMMETRY IN THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WHERE IT'S MUCH EASIER FOR US TO PUSH AND TO DELAY OUR SLEEP TIME THAN IT IS TO ACCELERATE ARE WAKE UP TIME IN OTHER WORDS IT'S EASIER TO STAY UP AND HANG OUT AT THE PARTY EVEN IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THERE THEN IT IS TO WAKE UP WHEN YOU'RE EXHAUSTED IN YOUR FAST ASLEEP MOST PEOPLE ARE PUSHING THROUGH INTO THE LATE HOURS OF THE EVENING AND NIGHT AND GOING TO BED MUCH LATER THAN THEY NATURALLY WOULD WANT TO AND SO I PERSONALLY DON'T WANT TO GO TO BED AT EIGHT PIAMOLOTIC GOOD THINGS HAPPEN BETWEEN EIGHT P M AND ELEVEN P M AND SO I WANT ENJOY THOSE AND I PUSH THROUGH THE THE EVENING HOURS BUT AS A CONSEQUENCE I'M RUNNING AUT O MELATONE IN MY MELATONAN RELEASIS BASICALLY SUBSIDED BY ABOUT THREE OR FOUR A M ANDS OAT MAKE SENSE THAT I WOULD WAKE UP I DON'T TAKE MELATONEAN FOR REASONS DISCUSSED IN PREVIOUS EPISODES A I DO RELY ON THINGS LIKE MYNESIUM GLICENATE OR MYNESIUM THREE NAHTE THINGS LIKE THE UNINE NOT SAYING ANY OF YOU NEED TO TAKE THOSE THAT'S JUST WHAT I HAPPEN TO TAKE IN ORDER TO FACILITATE MY SLEEP AND IT'S BEEN OF GREAT BENEFIT TO ME IF I WAKE UP IN TH MILL THE NIGHT AND I'M ANXIOUS FOR WHATEVER REASON AND MY MIND IS LOOPING I HAVE A COUPLE RULES ONE IS I DON'T TRUST ANYTHING I THINK ABOUT WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MILL THE NIGHT ANY OF IT UNLESS I'VE HAD A MAGNIFICENT DREAM AN I WANT TO WRITE IT DOWN I'LL DO THAT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE TYPICALLY WHEN I GO BACK AND READ IT IT'S NOT AT ALL MAGNIFICENT AM I CAN'T EVER REMEMBER COMING UP WITH ANYTHING REALLY FANTASTIC IN ONE OF MY DREAMS THAT STUCK WITH ME OR THAT I IMPLEMENTED I DON'T REALLY TRUST THE KIND OF THINKING THAT HAPPENS IN THOSE WE HOURS OF THE CIRCADEAN CYCHLE FOR ME THERE'S JUST NOTHING ITHER FOR ME TERRIBLY CREATIVE OR WORTH LINEAR IMPLEMENTATION AT THAT TIME BUT ONE THING THAT HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL IS TO SOMETIMES DO ONE OF THESE NONSLEEP DEEP REAST PROTOCALS AS A WAY TO GO BACK INTO SLEEP SO A HYPNOSIS AT BY A ER SOME OF THE SCRIPTS BY MICHAEL SEALY THAT I'VE MENTIONED BEFORE OR THE A REVERY HEALTH OR A YOGANEGRA PROTOCALL THOSE FOR ME HAVE BE VERY USEFUL AT HELPING ME TURN OFF CAN A LOOPING THINKING IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT AND FALL BACK ASLEEP IN REVIEWING MY SCHEDULE FOR YOU JUST AS A CONTEXT FOR HOW TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN TYPES OF TOOLS FOR OPTIMIZING LEARNING REALIZE THAT IT GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT THERE'S A NINETY MINUTE BOUT OF LEARNING IND WORK IN THE MORNING AND THEN A NINETY MINUTE BOUT OF CREATIVE TYPE WORK IN THE AFTERNOON IND THAT'S IT HEREA LOT OF HOURS IND BETWEEN OF COURSE AND I JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THOSE OURS FOR ME ARE OCCUPIED BY PRETTY I'M NOT MONDANE TASKS BUT THINGS THAT ARE ARE CONRANDOM THOSE ARE THINGS LIKE EMALE OR TTENDING TO ZUMMEETINGS OR A MEETING WITH COLLEAGUES AND STUDENTS AND OF THINGS OF THAT SORT I SOMETIMES WILL READ JUST FOR SAKE OF MY OWN ENRICHMENT I MENTION THOSE TWO NINETY MINUTE BOUTS BECAUSE THOSE OF THE TWO NINETY MINUTE BOUTS WHERE I'M TRYING TO EXPAND ON THE MENTAL CAPACITIES THAT I ALREADY HAVE THERE'S REALLY WHERE I'M TRYING TO STRETCH AND GROW WHAT I'M ABLE TO DO ON A REGULAR BASIS REFLEXIVELY SO ONE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE WHOLE DAY DOESN'T JUST CONSIST OF THOSE TWO NINETY MINUTE ABOUTS A THAT'S NOT THE WAY MY SCHETUAL WORKS AND THAT'S NOT THE WAY MY LIFE STYLE IS ARRANGE WHICH IS FORTUNATE CAUSE I ENJOY ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS AS WELL AND SO FOR MANY OF YOU OUT THERE WHO ARE IN SCHOOL WHO HAVE A FAMILY DEMANDS OR OTHER DEMANDS THE KEY IS TO SLOT IN THOSE BRAIN OPTIMIZATION SEGMENTS OF ABOUT NINETY MINUTES ONE OR TWO OR MAYBE MORE PER DAY YOU'E TRYING TO SLOT THOSE IN WHEREVER YOU CAN AMIDST YOUR OTHER OBLIGATIONS AND THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO DO BUT YOU WANT TO DO THAT AN INTELLIGENT WAY THAT'S ANCHOR TO YOUR BIOLOGY AND THEN YOU WANT TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH I'VE TALKED ABOUT TO DAY IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE THOSE SESSIONS TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THEM SO AS WE ROUND UP I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ONCE AGAIN AVE COVERED A HUGE RANGE OF TOPICS A RELATED TO OUTO OPTIMIZE LEARNING AND BRAINCHANGE AND ESSENTIALLY MENTAL PERFORMANCE AND I'VE SET THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF SOME BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM LIKE THE BASLGANGLIA GO NOGO PATHWAYS THE CIRCADIAN ONANOMIC SYSTEM AND SOME OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FOOD AND FASTING AND PARTICULAR CYPES OF FOOD IN ALERTNESS OR SLEEPINESS A LINEAR FOCUS AND STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION IS BEST SERVED BY HIGHLERT STATES ALTHOUGH NOT TOO ALERT AND HOW CREATIVE STATES AT LEAST THE FIRST PHASE OF CREATIVITY WHICH IS THE CREATIVE ARRANGEMENT CAN A BRAINSTORMING STAGE IS SUPPORTED BY  STATES OF RELAXATION OR EVEN SLIGHTLY SLEEPY BUT THE CRETIVE IMPLEMENTATION IS A VERY LINEARIN FOCUST AND DELIBERATE PROCESS MUCH LIKE THE HIGHLY FOCUS STATE THAT I DESCRIBED I DESCRIBED HOW I DO THESE THINGS THAT JUST TO GIVE YOU A CONTEXT THE LOT OF YOU ASK FOR IU WHAT I DO IN ORDER TO SET IT WITHIN A CONTEXT BUT BY NO MEANS ARE THESE RIGID TIMES AND WAYS OF DOING THINGS BUT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT WHAT I DO HAS A CIRCADIAN LOGIC IT ALSO HAS GROUNDING IN BIO LOGICAL MECHANISMS THEIRE VERY CONCRETE THAT WE KNOW THE CELLS AND MECHANISMS AND ARROW TRANSMITTERS AND THEN SOME OF THEM ARE A LITTLE BIT HA IT OUT INTO THE OM WHAT WE WOULD CALL CAN OF EMERGING OR AM YEN A I DON'T NOT SAY CUTTING EDGE BUT MAY BE FRONT EDGE OF WHAT NARROL SCIENCES TRI ANT UNDERSTAND ABOUT CREATIVITY AND SO FORTH WE WETHOSE ARE AREAS THAT ARE JUST NOW A COMING TO SOME A CLARITY AND THERE CERTAINLY A STILL LOT MORE WORK TO DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO ARRANGE ONES ROAUTINE BUT HOPEFULLY THE TOOLS AND PRACTICSES I DESCRIBED WILL BE USEFUL TO YOU I WANT TO MENTION THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK ME ABOUT SPECIFIC TOOLS AND PRACTICES THEY ASK ME OUT WHIMHOFF BREATHING ABOUT ICE BATHS OF TALK TO LUB ABOUT ICE PAS BEFORE I THINK AND COLD EXPOSURE ABOUT BY NORAL BEATS AND THINGS OF THOSE SORT I THINK THE WAIT TO LOOK AT ANY TOOL TO MODULATE OR MEASURE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS ASK WHETHER OR NOT IT'S GOING TO MOVE YOU UP OR DOWN THE STATE OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL WHETHE NOT' TO MAKE YOU MORE ALERT OR MORE CALM MORE FOCUST ARE LESS FOCUS THAT'S KIND OF THE THE TWO AXES HERES THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO BE MORE ALERT THAN YOU ARE AND INDEED THINGS LIKE COLD SHOWERS ICE BATHS A SUPEROXYGENATION WHIMHOFF TYPT READHING WILL BRING YOUR LEVEL OF ALERTNESS UP THERE SOME CAUTIONARY NOTES ASSOCIATE WITH EACH OF THOSE YOU NEED TO REAV AND UNDERSTAND THOSE CAUTIONARY NOTES FOR YOURSELF EVERYBODY'S DIFFERENT AND SOME OF THOSE CARRIES CERT AIN DANGERS UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS OTHERS HAVE HUGE MARGINS FOR SAFETY AN ICE BATH GENERALLY WAKES YOU UP A WARMER HOMATH GENERALLY CALMS YOU DOWN RIGHT BY NORAL BEATS AREN'T THE LOT OF DATA AND QUALITY PERU JOURNALS I DID PUT IN THE EFFORT TO GO SEARCH IT OUT THERE ARE A FEW BY NORAL BEATS ARE LISTENING TO FREQUENCIES OF SOUND THAT SLIGHTLY DIFFER OR OFFSET FOR THE TWO EARS IT HAS BEEN SHOWN CANSHIFT THE BRAIN INTO PARTICULAR STATES YOU'LL NOWISE TO DAY I DINRALLY TALK ABOUT ALPHA OR THATE ARE GAMA RHYTHMS I I PERSONALLY IND REVIEWING THE LITERATURE I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT ALPHISTATES ARE GREAT FOR AXS AND FATA STATES ARE GREATE FOR WHY AND BESIDES MOST OF US AREN'T WALKING ROUND OUR HOMES IN OUR WORKPLACES GEARED UP TO E G MACHINES ORE WITH WIRES DOWN BELOW ER SKALSO WE DON'T KNOW WHEN WE'RE IN THOSE STATES ANYWAY I THINK THE SUBJECTIVE READING OF WHEATHER R NOT ONE IS A LERT OR CALM AND WHETHER NOT THAT A LERTNESS OR CALMNESS MATCHES THE GOAL OR THE THING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN TERMS OF LEARNING INCLUDING SLEEP IS TE MOST VALUABLE INTERNAL TOOL AND RECOGNITION THAT WE CAN ALL HAVE IN OTHER WORDS IF I WANT TO BE VERY ALERT AN I NEED TO BE VERY LERT ANDI'M EXHAUSTED THERE MIGHT BE TOOLS THAT I SHOULD USE TO WAKE UP IT MIGHT ALSO SPEAK TO THE FACT THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE SLEPT AS AS WELL AS I COULD EVER SHOULD OFE THE NIGHT BEFORE SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT A MATCH BETWEEN WHERE WE ARE ON THAT AUTONOMIC AROUSAL SCALE AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND INDEED THEREARE GONG TO BE A LOT OF TOOLS INCLUDING SUPPLEMENTS AND OTHER PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND THINGS THAT CAN HELP MOVE US ALONG THAT AUTONOMIC CONTINUUM UP TOWARD MORE ALERTNESS ARE TOWARD MORE CALMNESS BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S ABOUT TAILORING THAT ALERTNESS AND CALMNESS TO THE PACIFIC TYPES OF LEARNING AND ACTIVITIES THAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO AND PERFORM AND IT'S RECIPROCAL MEANING SOME OF THOSE ACTIVITIES LIKE EXERCISE EARLY IN THE DAY WILL INCREASE YOUR LEVEL AUTONOMIC AROUSAL AND ALERTNESS CERTAIN FOODS WI'LL TEND TO WAKE YOU UP CERTAIN FOODS WILL TEND TO MAKE YOU MORE SLEEPY AND THE VOLUME OF FOOD AND THE TIMING OF FOOD IS A FACTOR ALSO SO IT'S A HUGE PARAMETER SPACE IS A HUGE SAV VARIABLES THE IMPACTS WHETHER NOT WE'RE FEELING WELL PERFORMING WELL LEARNING GRATE OR NOT LEARNING GRATE AND THE KEYTHING IS TO BE COME AND OBSERVER OF YOUR OWN SYSTEM AND WHAT WORKS FOR YOU AND TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERERE TWO BINS OF TOOLS FOR OPTOMIZING LEARNING AND BRAIN PERFORMANCE ONE ARE TOOLS THAT ARE REALLY ANCHORED IN BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM AND WE ARE CERTAIN OF WHAT THOSE ARE I'M TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THOSE THE OTHER THE MORE SUBJECTIVE TOOLS FOR SOME OF YOU VISUALIZATION MIGHT WORK TERRIFICALLY WELL FOR SOME OF YOU ONE SANG MIGHT REALLY WAKE YOU UP BECAUSE OF THE ASSOCIATIONS YOU HAVE WITH IT AND FOR ME I MIGHT JUST YOU KNOW I MIGHT REPEL ME FROM THE ROOM CAUSE I DON'T LIKE IT OR IT MIGHT PUT ME TO SLEEP BUT OF COURSE VOLUME IS KIND OF A UNIVERSAL LOUD MUSIC TONDS TO WAKE PEOPLE UP SOFT MUSIC DOESN'T TEND TO WAKE THEM UP QUITE AS MUCH SO PART OF TO DAY IS RALLY GETTING YOU TO THINK ABOUT IN A SCIENTIFIC WAY IN A STRUCTURED WAY ABOUT THE NON NEGOTIABLE ELEMENTS WHICH ARE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A PERIOD OF EVERY TWENTY FOR HOUR CYCHE WHEN YOU TEND TO BE MORE AWAKE AND APPERIOD WHEN OUTEND TO BE MORE ASLEEP AND HOW TO LEVERAGE THOSE WHO UARE NOT FIGHTING AND UP PILL BATTLE TO WAKE UP WHEN YOU ACTUALLY WOULD WANT TO BE IN AND SHOULD BE SLEEPY AND NOT TRYING TO GO TO SLEEP WHEN YOU ARE NATURALLY YOU KNOW GOING TO BE MOST TA WAKE SO LOT OF IT IS REALLY ANCHORS BACK TO THOSE QUOOR MECHANISMS OF BIOLOGY AND THEN YOU START LARING ON THE DIFFEREN PROTOCOLS OF FOOD AND SUPPLEMENTATION ET CETERA AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST MORE GOGOGO GO GO AND NOGO AND SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST CALMER AND HAVE A HARDER TIME GETTING INTO ACTION AN AN ACTIVITY IS JUST THE WAY THAT WERE WIRED SOME OF US HAVE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEMS THAT ARE MORE GEARED TOWARDS PARI SYMPATHETIC CALM STATES ONE THE REASONS I LOVE BULL DOGS NOT JUST MY BULL DOG IS THAT THEY ARE VERY CALM ANIMALS IN FACT THEY MAKE NO SPONTANEOUS MOVEMENTS UNLESS THEIRE SOMETHING TO RESPOND TO AND I FIND THAT INCREDIBLY RELAXING OTHER ANIMALS LIKE PITBULLS WHO I ALSO REALLY LIKE AND ENJOY ANOTHER SPECIES THEIR TAILS ALWAYS WAGGING AND THAT THERE ALWAYS IN A POSITION TO MAKE A MOVEMENT AT ANY AND HE SECOND CAUSE THEY TEND TO RIDE AT PRETTY HIGH LEVELS OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL THEY POP UP REALLY QUICKLY WHEN YOU SAY IT'S TIME TO GO FOR WHAP COSTELLIDOES ONE LIMB A A TIME AND SOMETIMES YOU JUST GOES BACT O SLEEP AND SO THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE THAT TO AND SO YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AND WHAT PARTICULAR GULLS YOU'RE TRYING TO PURSUE AS A FINAL CLOSURE TO TO THIS I WANT EMPHASIZE THAT TO DAY AS ALWAYS I'VE STRIVE TO BE ACCURATE I'M SURE IF I MADE MISTAKE SOME OF YOU WILL POINTED OUT AND I APPRECIATE THAT NI'LL POST OF CORRECTION IF WE AGREE THAT I INDEED MISSPOKE OR MICITED SOMETHING BUT BY NO MEANS WAS I EXHAUSTIVE A MAN MIGHT HAVE EXHAUSTED SOME OF YOU WHAT THE INFORMATION WASN'T EXHAUSTIVE MEANING THERE'S NO WAY THAT I COULD COVER ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH WE OPTIMIZE OR CAN OPTIMIZE LEARNING AND PERFORMANCE I THNK WE'VE TOUCHED ON A A NUMBER OF THEM THAT I HOPE THAT YOU'LL FIND VALUE IN IN THAT YOU'LL EXPLORE IN YOUR OWN LIVES WE ARE CONTINUING WITH THIS THEME BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO FOR THE SPODCAST WE STAND ONE THEME FOR AN ENTIRE MONTH FOR THE NEXT EPISODE WEARE GOING TO EXPLORE TO VERY ESSENTIAL ASPECTS OF NERL PLASTICITY THAT I SHOULD RELATE TO LEARNING WHICH ARE PAIN PAIN MANAGEMENT AND NURRAL REGENERATION AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T HAVE INJURIES OR DON'T SUFFER FROM CHRONIC PAIN THE DISCUSSION IS STILLGOAN TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT ONE BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO BE ABOUT PAIN THAT YOU'R TRYING TO GET RID OF IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE ABOUT HOW CERTAIN CENSORY EXPERIENCES WITHIN THE PAIN NETWORK CAN BECOME AMPLIFIED AS WELL AS HOW WE CAN USE TOP DOWN MODULATION WE CAN USE OUR MIND TO SUPPRESS THE PAIN RESPONSE WER ALSO CAN TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE HARD WIRED MECHANISMS THAT OUR BOTTOM UP THAT EXIST IN OUR PERIPHERY IN OUR BODY TO CONTROL PAIN AND WE'RE ALSO GOING TO DISCUSS A NUMBER OF INTERESTING INTERACTIONS BETWEN THE PAIN SYSTEM AND THE LEARNING SYSTEM SO AGAIN IF YOU'RE A NOT INTERESTED IN PAIN PER SAY IT STILL IS GOING TO BE A VERY VALID CONVERSATION FORSAKE OF UNDERSTANDING HOW TO OPTIMIZE BRAIN PERFORMANCE AND NORL REGENERATION GOES HAND IN HAND WITH THAT DISCUSSION SI HOPE YOU'LL JOIN US FOR THAT I SUPPOSE I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION THAT COSTELL HAS BEEN STORING EXTREMELY LOUDLY TO DAY YOI GOOD A GOOD LONG WALK THIS MORNING WHICH MEANS UP THE DRIVEWAY DOWN THE DRIVEWAY HE'S AN OLD DOG SO IF YOU'VE BEEN HEARING HIM IN THE BACKGROUND AND'S BEEN DISTRACTING NOW YOU KNOW WHY IT PROBABLY RELATES TO WHERE YOU WERE ON YOUR LEVEL OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL AND I'LL LEAVE IT'S YOU TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR YOURSELF MANY OF YOU CONTINUE TO GRACIOUSLY ASK HOW YOU CAN HELP SUPPORT THE PODCAST AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE QUESTION THE BEST WAY IS TO SUBSCRIBE WHEREVER IT IS YOU HAPPEN TO BE LISTENING OR WATCHING SO FOR THOSE VIEW THAT IT'S YOU TOO PLEASE SUBSCRID TO THE UTUBE CHANNEL IT'S APPLE SUBSCRIBE TO THE PODCAST ON APPLE OR IF IT SPOTIFIE SUBSCRIBE THERE MAY BE SUBSCRIBE TO ALL THREE IF YOU HAVE COMMENTS AND FEED BACK FOR US SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE PODCAST EPISODES OR TOPICS TO COVER PLEASE PLACE THOSE IN THE COMMENT SECTION ON YOU TO APPLE ALSO PROVIDES A SECTION WHERE YOU CAN GIVE US A RATING WE'D LOVE IT IF YOU GIVE US A FIVE STARVATING OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU FEEL THAT WE DESERVE AND IN GENERAL IF YOU COULD TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THE PODCAST WE HOPE THAT YOU WOULD TELL THEM BECAUSE YOU THINK THE INFORMATION WULD BE OF USE TO THEM OF COURSE TELL YOUR FRIENDS TELL YOUR FAMILY TELL YOUR CO WORKERS BECAUSE AS WE EXPAND THE PODCAST THE SUPPORT FOR THE PODCAST JUST GROWS ALONG WITH IT SO THAT'S A TERRIFIC WAY TO SUPPORT US AS ALWAYS CHECK OUT OUR SPONSORS WHICH OU WERE METJENED AT THE BEGINNING AND AS MENTIOND AT THE BEGINNING OF TO DAY'S EPISODE WE ARE NOW PARTNERED WITH MOMENTOUS SUPPLEMENTS BECAUSE THEY MAKE SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS THAT ARE OF THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST QUALITY AND THESHIP INTERNATIONAL IF YOU GO TO LIVE MOMENTOUS TOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN YOU WILL FIND MANY OF THE SUPPLEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED ON VARIOUS EPISODES OF THE HUBERUMEN LAB PODCAST AND YOU WILL FIND VARIOUS PROTOCOLS RELATED TO THOSE SUPPLEMENTS LASTBUT NOT LEAST ON BEHALF

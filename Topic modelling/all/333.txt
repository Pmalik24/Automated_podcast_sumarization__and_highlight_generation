ENOUGH IT WASN'T SUSAN WHO WAS OBSESSED WITH CHICKENS IT WAS KENNY A BOWL WHO WORK BACK STAGE AT THE NINY SECOND STREET WHY IN NEW YORK HIS HOUSE WAS FILLED WITH CHICKEN COPS CHICKEN MASKS HE GOT THE WHOLE STAFF ON TO CHICKENS INCLUDING SUSAN FOR A TIME THERE IN THE EIGHTIES POULTRY RELATED JOKES AN REFERENCES BECAME THE FAST WAY TO GET A LAUGH AT THE WHY I GUESS MOST OF US ARE CONDEMNED TO SEE NOTHING MORE THAN THE EASY COMEDY OF CHICKENS BUT SUSAN FIRCHUCI SAW SOMETHING ELSE THEYRE POTENTIAL GREATNESS THEYRE HIDDEN BEAUTY THERE GRANDEUR ONE DAY SHE GLEW TOGETHER SOME FINGER PUPPETS FOR A TEN MINUTE RANDITION OF THE CHICKEN LITTLE STORY FOR HER NEPHEW THAT WAS FOURTEEN YEARS AGO TO DAY IT IS A FULLENGTH OPERA ENJOYNED BY A CULL FOLLOWING WHENEVER IT GOES UP IN A WORKSHOP OR CAFE OUR SMALL THEATRE IT STILL PERFORMED WITH FINGER PUPPETS BUT NOW IT HAS A COMPLETE SCORE WRITTEN BY NOTED COMPOSER HENRY CREGER WHO DID DREAM GIRLS THE CHICKEN LITTLE OPERA HE WROTE WITH SUSAN FOR TUCI IS CALLED LOVE'S FOWL NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT'S F O W L WELL WERESTORE TOWITH THEOPENIN SIAMODETIATO RPETORIODEEMAETEIA ECLOSE REPTOR THEATR AND WE HAVE A SPECIAL SIGIN GUEST FOR YOU WHICH O DOSUSAN AND I

OKE LOCATE LIT SOME CAREFULLY BECAUSE ONCE TO BE GETS GOING CANCTUALLY HARMONIZE US WITH EANSES OS YO YOYOU MAY HAVE NOTICE THAT THIS LABRETTO IS AN ITALIAN JUST LIKE A REAL OPERA TWE FAR WAS JUST A BUNCH OF PAPA'S IN A BOX YE NOW WITH A GOOD IDEA AND THEN SUDDENLY SIS WENT INTO A TELLING IT BECAME SOMETHING BIGGER THAN WHAT IT HAD BEEN AND IT'S BECAUSE WHEN IT'S IN ENGLAS W WE ALL CAN KNOW WAT AND IT'S REALLY NOT THAT INTERESTING AS A GAAYA AS SOON AS IT'S AN ITALIAN IT GIVES US ANOUGH DISTANCE THAT WE CAN COME IN YOU KNOW MAKES US HE IS LIKE THE THE LOVER WHO DOESN'T WANT YOU YOU DON'T WANT ANYBODY MORE THAN YOU WANT THE ONE WHO DOESN'T WANT YOU RIA'S A AT SORT OF THE SAME THING OAONONEMYETY OO  TODEA NNODYOU MAY RECALL THAT WHN YOU LAST HEARD OF LITTLE BACK IN KIN THE GARDEN SHE WAS JUST AN AVERAGE BARN DOOR FOWL WHO HAD AN ACORN DROP ON HER HEAD WHICH SHE MISTAKENLY UNDERSTOOD TO BE THE SKYFALLING HER ALARMS EXCITED HER FRIENDS GOOSY LUSY TURKEY LARKEY AN DUCKY LUCKY AND THEY JOIN HER FOR A JOURNEY TO THE KING TO TELL HIM THE IMPORTANT NEWS ON THE WAY THEY MEED UP WITH SLY FOX LITTLE'S PAWLS EAGERLY ACCEPT HIS INVITATION FOR DINNER LITERALLY AS IT TURNS OUT FORTUNATELY FOR LITTLE HUNGER IS NOT ENOUGH TO DISTRACT HER FROM HER MISSION AND SHE TRACKS ON WHEN SHE MEETS THE KING HE TELLS HER THAT THE SKY IS NOT FALLING SJUST AN ACORN SO THE ENLIGHTENED CHICKEN LITTLE RETURNS TO HER COOP AND THAT'S WHERE THE STORY ENDS WHAT ARE WE TO TAKE AWAY FROM LITTLES EXPEARIENCE I LIKE TO THINK IT'S THAT LITTLE IS REWARDED WITH LIFE PRECISELY BECAUSE SHE WENT OFF ON THIS QUIXSOTIC MISSION TOTALLY IN THE GRIP OF A WRONG IDEA TEGETEA EAYTHIEA ND ANAMETE AND AN A ANGAN AGAN THE CHILDREN'S FABLE BARELY FIGURES INTO THE STORY IT'S JUST ONE SMALL EPISODE IN THE LIFE OF CHICKEN LITTLE NOW KNOWN AS LAPUCHENA PUCULA AFTER THE ACORN INCIDENT SHE GOES ON TO BECOME AN INTERNATIONALLY RENOWNED FIGURE AN ALMOST EVERY FIELD IMAGINABLE A DIVA POLITICS I CADEEN THEATR ART DEARING DUE LIKE VENUS SHE ARRIVES FROM SOME OF THE WORLD TRANSPORTED ON A SCALLOP SHELL BUT THE TRIUMPHS OF HER LIFE BEGAN AFTER YOUTHFUL OF AFFAIR WITH HA FIGHTING COCK ANDS BITTERLY AND SHE CONSOLES HERSELF AS WE ALL DO IT SOME POIN N HER LIVES BY PLUNGING INTO SHAKESPEARE SHE BECOMES AN OVERNIGHT SENSATION AS AN ACTRESS CELEBRATED ALL OVER THE WORLD FOR ONE ROLL JULIET CLEOPOTRA OPHELIA THE COMPANY THEN PERFORMS A AN ACCERPT A RECREATION OF THE PERSIGNATURE ALL WHICH IS RICHARD THERE OGOMIT'S OURPBARN HEART TO HALET WHAT IS A GREAT TRADITION OF WOMEN PLAYING THE MEN'S ROLLS AND SHAKESPEARE BUT I THINK RICHARD E THIRD FATHER RMORE RARE ROLLS TO BE PLAYED BY A WOMAN THAT'S HOW A THATS AR TOM AN ACTRESS THIS CHICKEN RAS  IN ASSURE YOU THERE IS NOTHING LIKE WATCHING A FOUR INCH TALL FINGER PUP AND CRYING OUT A HORSE A HORSE MY KINGDOM FOR A HORSE IN ITALIAN NOT TO MENTION THAT THAT PUPPET IS A CHICKEN SURROUNDED BY A WHOLE SUPPORTING CAST OF POULTRY AND OTHER AVIAN SUPERNUMERARIES SUSAN SAYS THAT ARTISTICALLY THERES SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT CHICKENS THERARE CLEAN SLAVE THERE ARE YOU CAN PUT ANYTHING ON THEM YOU CAN PROJECT ANYTHING UNDER THEM BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE THEY HAVE TO ME AT LEAST A VERY STRONG PERSONALITY EXCEPT FOR LOPL CHENA AND THE OPERA SHE MOVES INTO THE FIELD OF OURCHAEOLOGY MASTERS IT NEEDLESS TO SAY AND MAKES A GREAT DISCOVERY THE LAST TUME OF GALOPATRA BUT NOT BEFORE SHE SAILS THE SEVEN SEES SHIPWRECKED IT'S RESCUED BUT IS BY PIRATES AND THEN SHE MITES THE PIRATE KING AS HE SOON AS HE MEETS HERVASA LONTER BECAUSE OF HER SWEET SPIRIT CAUS SHE COMES IN AND SHE SAYS HERE YOU SEE A LITTLE CHICKEN ON WHO ALTHOUGH IM DRIPPING WET I'M PROUD AND YELLOW LET ME REPEAT THAT LERIC FOR YOU AND A PURE TRANSLATION ALTHOUGH I STAND BEFORE

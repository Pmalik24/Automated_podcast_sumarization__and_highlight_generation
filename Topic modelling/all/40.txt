WELL YESTERDAY THE SUPREME COURT DISAPPOINTED EVERY ONE ON THE FAR LEFT BY RULING NIN NOTHING THAT ACTUALLY STATES CANT JUST RANDOM WE TAKE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES OFF THE BALLAT AND THEY DID SO FOR A COUPLE REASONS AS WE DISCUSSE YESTERDAY THIY THEY SAID THAT FIRST OF ALL STATES DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO REMOVE A FEDERAL CANDIDATES BECAUSE FEDERAL CANDIDATES OUR CANDIDATES FOR FEDERAL OFFICE AND SECOND THEY SAID THAT IF YOU ARE GOING TO DEFIND INSURRECTION UNDER THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT THAT HAVE TO BE DONE BY CONGRESS NOT BY SOME MIRANDO AT THE STATE LEVEL REGARDLESS OF THE RATION OW THE NINE O DECISION HAS MADE PEOPLE VERY VERY VERY ANGRY ON THE LEFT THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THE LAW AND BY UNDERSTOOD THE WAW THEY MEAN THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY FINALLY HAD TRUMP EVERY TIME THEY THINK THEY HAVE TRUMP IS LIKE THE ENDING OF A SCHOOBY DU CARTUN LIKE WE UNMASKED HIM OH NO WE WOULD GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT BUT ONE FOR THOSE DARN KIDS AND THEN SGERURDER THAY THAT THAT T LEGITIMATELY EVERY TIME THEY TRIED TO GET TRUMP THEY AND UP BEING UNMASSED AS FOOLS AND THIS MEANS THAT THEY THEN HAVE TO EXPOSE WHAT THEIR ACTUAL AGENTA WAS IN THE FIRST PLACE WHICH WAS OF COURSE NOT TO BAR IN INSURRECTIONIST FROM HIGHER OFFICE THE PURPOSE WAS TO GET RID OF THE REPUBLICAN LIKELY NOMINY FORGUANOMINY THAT THE PERSON WAS CRURRENTLY LEADING JOBIDEN BI IN OUTSIDE THE RANGE OF IRROR AMOUNT IN ALL THE NATIONAL POLING SO YESTERAY THE COLERAT OF SECRETARY OF STATE THE PERSON WHO INITIATED THIS ENTIRE STUPID PROCESS IN THE STATE OF COLORADA PRES NUMED GENNA GRISWELL SHE SAID THAT

OF BLEAP FOR BREAKFAST THIS THAT THIS IS WHERE WE ARE NOW SALID STUFF THERE FROM KEITH OLD MEN HE'S PEING IN HIS OWN EYES TO FIGHT TRUMPETS A STRATEGY IT'S A STRATEGY MEANWHILE THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS ARE THREATENING THAT THEY'RE NOW GOING TO TRIE D PASSABILL THAT WOULD COTIFID TRUM'S BEHAVIOR IS INSURRECTION UNDER THE CONSTITUTION GOOD LUCK WITH THAT REPRESENT HIM JIMY RASKAN SEIT ON TUESDAY ON SEANEN AT THE SUPREME COURT UNANIMOUSLY OVERTURNING THAT COLLOR A SUPREM CORRULING MEANS THAT THE CONGRESS HAS TO TAKE IT UP SO RASKAN SAID THAT HE IS GOING TO ACTUALLY NOW PUSH WITH A NUMBER OF MY COLLEGUES INCLUDING DEBBY WASERMAN SHILTON ERIC SWALLWELL THAT HE'S ONE WHOIS STUPPING A CHINESE SPY TREVIVE LEGISLATION THAT WE HAD SET UP A PROCESS BY WHICH WE CULD DETERMINE THAT SOME ONE WHO COMMITTED INSURRECTION IS DISQUALIFIED BY SECTION THREE OF THE FOURTEENTH MENDMENT SO THE QUESTION IS WHETHER AT MY JOHNSON WOULD ALLOW US TO BRING THIS TO THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE MEAN THE ANSWERS NO IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BUT ALL OF THIS DEMONSTRATES THERE IS A WIDE GAP THAT HAS NOW EMERGED IN LIFE BETWEEN THE RADICAL LEFT AND REALITY AND WHEN EVEN THE MODERATE LEFT OR PEOPLE WHO HAVE A JOB LIKESAY THE RADICALS ON HE SPRIMCORT OF THE LEFT WHO SAW OF A JOB WHICH IS TO READ TAXE LIBE SONA SOTOMIR WHO'S A FAR LEFT PERSON OR COTONGI BROUN CHACTON A VERY FAR LEFT PERSON OR LANICAGAN WHO SORT OF ON THE MODERATE LEFT THOSE THREE PEOPLE VOTED IN FAVOR OF THE NINE NOTHING DECISION HERE AND THERE'SA COMPLETE DISTCONNECTITEN THOSE PEOPLE AND THE RADICAL BAS AND AS WE B BEEN DISCUSSONG BECAUSE IT IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE UPCOMING TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ELECTION JOBIDON HAS FOUND HIMSELF IN THRALL TO THE RADICALS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MODERATES AND THAT IS WHY HE IS LOSING HE IS BLEEDING SUPPORT FROM THE MIDDLE HE'S MOSING SUPPORT AMONG THE BASE BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT THAT SUPPORT THAT HE'S LOSING AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE THAT IS A MARGINAL LOSS OF SUPPORT CONSIDERING THAT A LOW PROPENSITY VOTING GROUP IN THE FIRST PLACE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY HIGH PROPENSITY ARE INDEPENDENT COLLEGE EDUCATED PEOPLE WHO SWING VOTE AND AND THOSE PEOPLE ARE NOT LOOKING AT JOBIDON AND SEEING SOMEBODY WHO'S ON THE SAME PAGE THET THEY ARE AND SO THE MORGO BIDON IS IN THRALL TO HIS RADICAL LEFT AND THE FURTHER LEFT THAT RADICAL LEFT MOVES THE WORSE IT IS FOR JOBIDON AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SO HOW FAR LEFT HAS THE RADICAL LEFT MOVE THEY MOVED SO FAR LEFT THEN NOW EVEN ALEXANDERA O COZO CORTAZ IS NOT FAR LEFT ENOUGH FOR THEM SO IN WHAT HAD TO BE THE MOST AMUSING PIECE OF VIDIO OF THE YEAR

WHICH KILLED SEVEN IS RAILIES AND ALSO HAPPENS TO HAVE A SLEW OF PROTERRIS MESSAGING AN ASSOCIATIONS WITH FIGURES LIKE CALIAL ALBATANI A SENIOR MEMBER OF THE PARAMILITARY GROUP PALISTONAN ISLOMIC GEHAD THE SAME LEGACYMEDIA THAT WILL STILL PRINT REPORTS DOUBTING WHETHER THERE WAS MASS RAPE AT THE NOBLE MUSIC FESTIVAL ON OCTOBER SEVENTH THE THOSE SA MEDIA ARE THE USEFUL IDIOTS OF THE RADICAL ISLAMAS AND THEY ALSO HAPPEN T BE THE PEOPLE WHO JOBIDON BELIEVES HE IS ANSWERABLE TO AND THAT IS WHYCHO BIDON IS HE IS SO FAR OFF THE TRACK OF WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT FROM HIM HE IS SO FAR OFF THE TRACK OF WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT FOR HM N THEY WANT A MODERATION IND DECENCY AND INSTEAD THEY GOT THIS RADICAL GARBAGE WITH A BUMBLING OLD FOOL AT THE TOP OF TE PILE THAT'SWHAT THEY GOT SPEAKING OF WHICH BEING OF RADICAL GARBAGE ITH A BUMBLING OLD FOOL AT THE TOP ACCORDING TO THE DAILY WIRE THE BIDADMINISTRATION HAS NOW EMPOWERED A PROFESSIONAL ACTIVIS TO TRAVEL THE GLOBE ON THE TAXPAR TIME TO PUSH TRANS GENDERISM IN GENERIDIOLOGY FROM OSTRALIA TO PRAZI SOUTH AFRICA TO SWEDEN JUSTICA STERN TRAVELS A CROSS THE WORLD ATTENDING SO CALLED PRIDE EVENDS AS THE STATE DEPARTMENT SPECIAL ONVOY TO ADVANCE THE HUMAN RIGTS OF LESBIAN GAYE BY SEXUAL TRANSGENDER QUEER AND INTERSEX PERSONS STERN WHO AS BOSTISHEES THE HIGHEST RANKING LESBIAN WOMAN IN THE ABIDAN ADMINISTRATION IS PAID AN ANNUAL SALARY OFOVER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND TASK WITH PROMOTING A FAR LEFT VIE ON SEX ENGENDER LOBBYING FORN GOVERNMENTS AND ASSISTING ACTIVIS ORGANIZATIONS SHE WIAS A POINT THAT BIBIDON IN SEPTEMBER TWENTYT TWENTY ONE HER WORK AS GONE LARGELY UN NOTICE BY THE MEDIA SHE BOLSTERS THE PRESIDENT'S BROUDER EFFORTS TO LEVERIGE THE MIGHT OF THE FEDERAL AGENCIES AND THEIR BURACRACIES AND SERVICE OF A FAR LEFT TO GENDA SHE TRAVELS A SPECIAL ENVOY ANDTHEY'VE TAKEN HER TO AT LEAST TWENTY TWO COUNTRIES INCLUDING ARGENTNE OUSTROG A BRAZIL BOT SUANA CANDIDA GERMANY GREEE INDIA LITHUANIA MALASIA MARICIUS MEXICO NEPAL THE NETHERLAND'S PANAMUP PERUE THE PHILIPIANE SOUTH AFICA SWEDEN SWITZERLAND TILAND AND VIANOM BY THE WAY I'M JUST GOING TO POINT OUT HERE HOW MANY OF THOSE COUNTRY ARE OF THE COUNTRIES THAT I JUST MENTIONED HOW MANY OF THEM ARE YOU KNOW RADICAL MUSLEM RULED I NOTICE THE WRE ZERO IN THE IDDLE EAST I NOTICE THAT SO SHE SHE'S HAPPY TO PREACH EL G B T POLITICS PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE EXCEPT FOR WHERE THE MUSLEMS ARE MALASIAIS THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THIS LEST I BELIEVE THITS MUSLEM SHE SAID GOOD FORN POLICY IS INCLUSIVE FORN POLICY THAT MEANS HAVING SENIOR EPERTS ON EL G B T CU I RIGHTS SO WISE THE BIDADMINISTRATION TROTTING AROUND AT TAX PAYR EXPENSE THIS LADY TO VARIOUS GA PRIDE PARADES AROUND THE GLOBE BECAUSE THE STATE DEPARTMENTS SAS QUOTED IS COMMITTED TO PROMOTING AN PROTECTING THE FREEDOM DIGNITY AND A QUOLITY OF ALL PERSONS INCLUDING TRANSGENDER NON BINARY AN GENDER NON CONFORMING PERSONS AROUND THE WORLD THIS IS WHAT AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM HAS COME TO ME AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM IS NOT THINGS LIKE PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERSHIP IT IS NOT ANYTHING LIKE FRE SPEECH IT IS NOT LIMITED GOVERNMENT AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM APPARENTLY IS EL G B T KU I MINE IS DIVIDEA BY SIGN POLITICS THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT THE BIDE ADMINISTRATION CAN BE PUSHING AT THIS POINT AND AGAIN THIS COES TO ONE OF THESE CENTRAL PROBLEMS BETWEEN LEFT AND WRIHT TO DAY I THINK THAT IT IS FAIR TO STATE THAT IF YOU GO BACK TO SAY EVEN THE NINETEEN NINETIES THERE IS LARGE CROSS OVER BETWEEN WHAT THE LEFT IN THIS COUNTRY WANTED IN WHAT THE RIGHT IN THIS COUNTRY WANTED DURING THE CLINTON ERA THAT'S WHY HOE COULD GET THINGS DONE SOMETIMES BECAUSE WHAT PEOPLE WANTED GENERALLY SPEAKING WAS A GOVERNMENT THAT WAS LIMITED IN ITS INTERVENTION IN DAIL Y LIFE PEOPLE STILL WANTED SOLID FAMILIES THERE IS SOME ARGUING AROUND THE EDGES WITH REGARD TO SAY THINGS LIKE BENEFITS FOR SAME SEX COUPLES BUT THERE IS NO TALK IN THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES IN FACT EVERYBODY WAS TALKING THE OPPOSITE ABOUT GAY MERRIAGE THE IDEA WAS MAYBE CIVIL UNIONS AND CIVIL UNIONS WERE RELIGIOUS ABOUT GRANTING LEGAL RIGHTS LIKE HOSPITAL VISITATION OR RIGHTS IN WILLS TO GAY COUPLES BUT THERE IS NO EDEA OF MERIAGE AS A SUBSTITUTION FOR GAY COUPLES FOR TRADITIONAL MERRIAGE THAT WAS THOSE OFF THE TABLE IN THE NINETIES EVEN THE LEFT AT THAT POINT WITH REAR TOABORTION FOR EXAMPLE THE QLINTON LINE WIS SAFE LEGAL AND RARE THERE ISE STILL CROSS OVER IN WHICH PEOPLE RECOGNIZED THAT ABORTION WAS A GREAT EVIL AND NOW THINKS OF COMPLETELY BROKEN APART THEY' COMPLETELY BROKEN APART AND BECAUSE THERE IS NO COMMON VITION IN THE UNITED STATES ANY MORE OF WHAT EVEN CONSTITUTES A GOOD THAT MEANS THAT YOU WILL HAVE ADMINISTRATIONS PROMOTING AROUND THE GLOBE THINGS THAT ARE NOT AGREED TO BY THE VAST MAJORITYOF AMERICANS MOST AMERICANS ARE NOT INTERESTED IN PAYING ENVOYS TO GO PROMOTE TRANS GENDERISM IN MALASIA THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE THINK OF IS A QUARPS AMERICAN VALUE NOR SHOULD WE THINK OF THAT AS A QARPS AMERICAN VALUE THAT IS OW WHAT EXCEPT AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM IS BUT FOR THE LEFT IT IS AS THEY'VE REE TO FINED WHAT IT IS TO BE A GOOD AMERICAN THIS IS WHY YOU'VE SEEN SO MUCH IRE IN THE UNITED STATES NGAIN WE OU HVE A SET OF COMMON VALUES UNIT THEY ARE BROADLY BROADLY RIT EVEN IF THERE'S A LOT OF PLATE IN THE JOINS BE STILL HAVE THOSE COMMON VALUES HE AN HAVE A COUNTRY BUT WHEN THOSE FOLLOW WAY THEN WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU HAVE LEFT THE ANSWER IS NOT MUCH MEAN THAT THE AGAIN THE FACT IS THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS DECIDED THAT IT IS GOING TO PROMOTE WHAT IT CALLS DEMOCRACY BUT NOT REALLY BECAUS THE SORT OF DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU ARE IN THE WORLD WHERE THEY SUPPORT THEDEMOCRACY OR NOT RIGHT NOW THE BON NDMINISTRATION IS PROMOTING A TYRANNICAL IS LAWMAC GOVERNMENT THE PALSTONIAN AUTHORITY IN ITS ASPIRATIONS ABOVE THE INTERESTS OF AN ALLY OF THE UNITED STATES THAT HAPPENS TO BE DEMOCRATIC ISRAEL SO WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT DEMOCRACY IT EVERYONE KNOWS THEY DON'T REALLY MEAN IT SO WHAT EXACTLY IS THE BY ADMINISTRATION PUSHING AROUND NOT PUSHING PROPERTY OWNERSHIP NALY PUSHING FREE MARKETS JOBIN IS LOOKING FOR GLOBAL BASE LINE TAXES OF FIFTEEN PER CENT SO WHAT EXACTLY ARE THOSE AMERICAN EXCEPTIONAL VALUES THAT GOBIN IS PUSHING HE CAN'T DIFIND THEM HE'S LET THE LEFT TO FIND THEM FOR HIM A AMERICANS DON'T LIKE THAT LEFTIST DEFINITION AND JUST ONE SECOND WHEN GT THE

THOUGHT WOULD NOT DISCREDIT ITSELF IT SCIENCE BECAUSE AFTER ALL SCIENCE IS HELD TO THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD YOF A HYPOTHESIS YOU TEST IT IF THE TEST DOESN'T WORK THEN YOU GO BACK TO THE DRAWING POURT BUT SCIENCE HAS BECOME IN ARBITRARY TOOL OF POLITICAL PROFESSIONALS THAT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE ER THE SCIENCE IS UNCLEAR SO IT USED TO BE THAT THE FIRST RULE WAS DOE NO HARM NOW THE FIRST RULE IS DO AS MUCH

DESIGN TO PROMOTE I RATICAL AND INSANE A GENDA AND MEANWHILE S BEING OF A RADICAL AND INSANE A GENDA A FEDERAL APPEALS COURT HAS NOW CORRECTLY A LOWED TEXAS TO PUT FORWARD ITS OWN EMIGRATION LOSS IS THE FEDERAL GOVRNMENT WILL DO IT ACCORDING SIANEN A FEDERALS APPEAL A FEDERAL PEALS CORT GRANTED A TEMPORARY STAY OF A LOWER COURTS DECISION TO BLOCK THE ENFORCEMEN OF A CONTROVERSIAL TEXAS IMIGRATION

GOING UP TO THE  SUPREME COURT THE SUPREME COURT HAS PUT IT ON HOLD AT THE MOMENT SO WE'LL SEE HOW THAT IS JUDICATED THE UIIT'S THE BI ADMINISTRATION BY THE WY THAT SAYING THAT TEXAS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO ARREST PEOPLE FOR ILLEGAL IMIGRATION BETWEENS THEIR ACTIVELY INTERVENING TO EVEN STOP OTHER AUTHORITIES FROM FIGHTING THE PROBLEM OF ILLEGAL IMIGRATION  MEANWHILE THE BINE IMISTRATION CONTINUES TO FIB ABAUT ALL THIS JOHN CURBY WHO THE NATIONAL SECURITY SPOKE PERSON AND REALLY THAT A FACT O COMPETENT PRES SECRETARY FOR THE WHITE HOUSEINCE COREEN JON PERITERBERALLATOR JOB HE WAS ON FOX NEWS YESTERDAY SUGGESTING THAT BIDON HAS NOT DISENGAGE FROM THE BOARD PATRAL DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE PRIOR HEAD OF THE BORD PATRALCITY LITERALLY NEVER HAD CONVERSATION WITH EITHER BIDON OR

KNOW WHAT DEMOCRA TRIBE DOING THEY SHOULD NOW BE IMITATING THE EXAMPLE OF JOHN FETDERMAN IN PENNSYLVANIA HE WAS ELECTED HELMISTON A REVERSE BIDON SO BIDON WAS ELECTED AS MODERATE AND HIS GOVERNING IS RADICAL JOHN FEDDRMAN WAS ELECTED AS HERATICAL AND HIS GOVERNING IS MODERATE SO JOHN FEDDERMAN COMES INTO OFFICE AND HE IMMEDIATELY START'S PUSHING FOR EXAMPLE THINGS LIKE BORDER CONTROL HE' START SUGGESTING THAT HE IS ON ISRAL SIDE IN ITS WAR AGAINST AE ENICITLETERRAS CRUP COMMOSS AND GUSS WHAT HE'S APPROVALRATING WITH DEMOCRATS IN PENNSYLVANIA IS SEVENTY SIX TO SEVEN IN THE LATEST QUINNIPEACPOL HE'S NOT AFRAID OF HIS OWN BAS AND THAT MEANS THAT HE'S WINNING CAS GUSS WHAT JOBIDON DOESN'T NEED COLLEGE STUDENTS IN MICHIGAN TO VOTE FOR HIM HE NEEDS MODERATES IN MICHIGAN TO VOTE FOR

ACTRY APPROPRIAT GIVIN THA THE CIRCUMSTANSERE A AT THE BORDER JOHN FEDERMAN MAKING THE SMART PLAY MOVING TOWARD THE CENTRE WHAE LEFT IS TRYING TO PROCLAIM THAT HE'S WILDLY UN POPULAR THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE IT IS NOT TRUE JOHN FEDDERMAN IS ONE OF THE MORE POPULAR FIGURES IN PENNSYLVANIA POLITICS AT THIS POINT BECAUSE HE DIDN'T DO THE DUM THING JOBIDON DID THE DUM THING HE DECIDED TO STEER WAY OUT TO HIS LEFT HE'SGOIN TO PAY THE PRICE FOR THAT ELECTORALLY THERE'S A REASON HE IS TRAILING IN ALL THE SWING STATES THERS REASON INDEPENDENTS ARE TURNING TOWARD ON'LL TRUMP JOHNL TRUMP HAS LOCKED UP NINETY SEVEN PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR HIM IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR JOBIDON HAS LOCKED UP EIGHTY THREE PER CENTS OF THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR HIM IN TWENTY TWENTY THOSE NUMBERS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR JOBIDON  MEANWHILE SPEAKING OF RADICALS WHO CAN'T GET THEIR OWN CITY'S UNDER CONTROL NEW YORK HAS HAD INCREASED CRIM OHY BECAUSE THEY DECIDED TO RELEASE PEOPLE WITHOUT BALE BECAUSE THAT'S THE STUPIDEST THING H YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO WITH CRIMINALS IT TURNS OUT FIGHTING CRIMES ACTUALLY SUPER EASY YOU TAKE CRIMINALS AND YOU PUT THEM IN A PLACE WHERE THE CAN HARMONY WELS CALL IT PRISON FOR EXAMPLE AND THEN YOU JUST PUT THEM THERE AND LIEVE THEM THERE THAT'S WHAT YOU DO CRIMINALS AND THEN THEY AREN'T IN PUBLIC HARMING OTHER PEOPLE I KNOW THESE IT LHESE LAKE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT STUFF THAT NO ONE CAN FIGURE ATICCEPT FOR EVERY CIVILIZATION IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY BUT WE CAN'T FIGURED OUT IT'S A MYSTERY RAPET IN ENIGMA HOW DO YOU SOLVE CRIME PROBABLY SHOULD JUST TAKE THE CRIMINALS YOU'SH PROBABLY AVN TIC A TRIP QUICK TRIP DOWN TO THE JAIL AFLECADA PROBLY RELEASE THEM BACK IND PROBABLY THEY'VE LEARNED A LESSON AND AT ALL BE GRATE ACCORDING TO THE NERC POST REMEMBER WHAN POLITICIANS WERE TAUTING THE SUCCESS OF BALE REFORM REMEMBER THE MEANINGLESS AND DECEPTIVE NUMBERS THEY THREW OUT YMOURK CITY COMPATROL OF BRADLAND OR CLAIMS IN REPORT ONLY ONE PER CENT TO PEOPLE RELEASED ON BALE UNDER BALE REFORM ARE REARRESTED FOR VIOLENT FELON WHILE THEIR CASES PENDING AND THEN STATE SENTET MAJORITY LEADER ANDRAA STUART COUSINCE SAID THE NUMBER WAS TWO PER CENT WELL A NEW STUDY OF BALE REFORM OUTSIDE IN YOR CITY IN THE SUBURBS AN UP STATE PREPARED BY JOHN JA COLLEGE OF CRIMNAL JUSTIS DATA COLLABORATIVE FOR JUSTICE SHOWS SIXTY SIX PER CENT OF PEOPLE RELEASED UNDER BALE REFORM WH HAD A RECENT PRIORREST WE'RE REARRESTED WITHIN TWO YEARS OF THEIR RELEASE SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT OF DEFENDENS WO HAD A REASEENT PRIOR FELONY ARREST IN THE PASTIER WE'RE RELEASED WE'RE ALSO REARRESTED WITHIN TWO YEARS OF THEIR RAIGNMENT ALMOST HALF OF THOSE WHERE REARRESTED FOR FELONY WAIT YOU MEAN THAT CRIMINALS DO CRIME THAT RAZY I WES STOLD THE CRIMINALS ARE VICTIMS OF THE SYSTEM AND THAT AFTER ALL THEY SHOPLIF BECAUSE THEY NEED BREAD IN THE WORDS OF THAT GENIUS ALEXANDERA OCAZO CARTEZ BY THE WAY IT'S WORTH NOTING HERE THAT THE CENTER THAT WROTE THIS STUDY WE'RE VOCAL SUPPORTERS OF THE BALE REFORM WAWS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING ARREST OUTSIDE NEW YORK CITY DECREASED FROM A HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO A HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO EVEN AS CRIMES INCREASE IN FACT THERE'RE SEVENTEEN THOUSAND MORE CRIMES IN TWENTY TWENTY TO THEN TWENTY NINETY BUT THIRTY FHOUSAND FEWER ARRESTS WELL I MEAN THERE'S A SHOCK AGAIN AMAZING YOU MEAN WHEN YOU RELEASE CRIMINALS ON TO THE STREETS THE DAT MAKESM NO NO A CALIFORNIA IS DOING THE SAME THING ACCORDING TO THE WALL STREE JOURNAL WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF LAWMAKERS REINVENTED THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO TARGET'S S STEMIC RACES HM INSTEAD OF CRIME CALIFORNIAS ABOUT TO FIND OUT CALIFORNA PASSTALAW AND TWENTY TWENTY CALLED THE CALIFORNIA RACIAL JUSTICE ACT WHICH MEANS EVERY FELLON SERVING TIME IN THE STATE PRISON AN JAIL CAN NOW RETROACTIBLY CHALLENGE HIS CONVICTION AND SENTENCING ON THE GROUNDS OF SYSTEMIC BIAS S THE PRISONER DOESN'T NEED TO SHOW THAT THE POLICE OFFICER PROSECUTOR JUDGE R JUR WAS RACIST ALL THEY HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE IS THAT IN THE PAST CRIMINAL SUSPECTS OF HIS RACE WERE ARRESTED PROSECUTED OR SENTENCE MORE OFTEN OR MORE SEVERELY THAN MEMBERS OF OTHER RACIAL GROUPS SO IN OTHER WORDS IF YOUARE A BLACK FELIN IN PRISON YOU'RE GOING TOEABLE TO SU TO LOWER YOUR SENTENCE BASED ONS ISTEMIC FACTORS NOW EVERY EXAMINATION OF SENTENCING IS COMPLICATED BY THE REALITIES WHICH IS THAT SENTENCING DIFFERS BY NOT ONLY THE CRIME BUT THE BEHAVIOUR DURING THE CRIME FOR EACH IN EVERY PERSON WHO'S ENGAGED IN A CRIME AND SO SIMPLY TAKIN A BASELINE OF BLACK PEOPLE ARE SENTENCE FOR THE SAME CRIMES LONGER THAN WHITE PEOPLE DOESN'T TAKE INTO A CCOUNT ANY OF THE EXTERNAL FACTORS OTHER CRIMES THAT WERE PLED DOWN CRI NAL HISTORIES OF THE SUSPECTS BEHAVIOR DURING THE ARREST IN FACT COMPARING THESE TWO THINGS IS SORT OF LIKE SUGGESTING THAT WOMEN EARN LESS THAN MEN ON AVERAGE AND TERMS OF SALARY IGNORING THINGS LIKE HOW MANY HOURS ARE WORKED OR WHAT JOBS PEOPLE ARE IN AS THE WALZTER JORNAL POINTS OUT CUART TESTIMONY NOW SOUNDS A A CRITICAL RACE STUDIES COURSE WHEN A FELLON IN SAN FRANCISCO CONTESTED HIS ARREST AND PROSECUTION FOR HAVING LOADED HAND GUN IN HIS CAR A RACE EXPERT TESTIFIED THE ARRESTING OFFICERS USE OF THE PHRASE HIGH CRIME AREA DEMONSTRATED BI US AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR THE APPEALS COURT ALLOWED THE FELLON'S CLAIM TO PROCEED THE SAME EXPERT WHO TESTIFIED THIS BY THE WAY ALSO TESTIFIED THAT WHITES OUR PSYCHOPATHS WHO'SE BEHAVIOR REPRESENTS AN UNDERLYING BIOLOGICALLY TRANSMITTED PROCLIVITY THIS'S GOING TO HEATHER MACDONALDS WRITING ABOUT ALL THIS S I CAN'T IMAGINE

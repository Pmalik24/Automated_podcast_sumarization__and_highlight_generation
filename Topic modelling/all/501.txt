WELCOME TO THE YOU WERE MEN LATPON  SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TOE I MAN YOUR HUBERMEN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBOLOGY AND OTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE TALKING ALL ABOUT FOOD AND THE BRAIN WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT FOODS THAT ARE GOOD FOR YOUR BRAIN IN TERMS OF FOCUS IN TERMS OF BRAIN HEALTH GENERALLY END THE LONGEVITY OF YOUR BRAIN YOUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN COGNITION AND CLEAR THINKING OVER TIME WE ARE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHY AND HOW YOU PREFER CERTAIN FOODS TO OTHERS AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE THREE MAJOR SIGNALS THAT COMBINE TO DRIVE YOUR FOOD CHOICES I GIVE YOU A LITTLE HINT OF WHAT THOSE ARE ONE OF THOSE SIGNALS COMES FROM YOUR GUT AND IS COMPLETELY SUBCONSCIOUS THIS IS NOT THE GUT MICROBIOM PERSAY THESE ARE NUROND IN YOUR GUT THAT ARE SENDING SIGNALS TO YOUR BRAIN THAT YOU ARE UNAWARE OF ABOUT THE NEUTRIENT CONTENTS OF THE FOODS THAT YOU ARE EATING THE SECOND SIGNAL IS HOW METABOLICALLY ACCESSIBLE A GIVEN FOOD IS MEANING HOW READILY THAT FOOD CAN BE CONVERTED INTO ENERGY THAT YOUR BRAIN NOT YOUR BODY BUT THAT YOUR BRAIN CAN USE AND THE THIRD SIGNAL IS PERHAPS THE MOST INTERESTING ONE IT'S THE SIGNAL OF BELIEF IT'S THE SIGNAL OF WHAT YOU PERCEIVE AND BELIEVE THE FOOD THAT YOUR EATING TO CONTAIN AND WHAT YOU THINK IT CAN DO FOR YOU HEALTHWISE AND ENERGY WISE AND THAT MIGHT SOUND A LITTLE WISHU WASH YOUR VAGUE BUT WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE MECHANISTIC DATA TO SUPPORT THE FACT THAT YOU CAN CHANGE WHAT YOU EAT SO MUCH SO THAT YOU CAN DRIVE YOUR BRAIN AND YOUR BODY TO CRAVE FOODS THAT ARE GOOD FOR YOU ER AT LEAST BETTER FOR YOU THAN THE FOODS YOU MIGHT CURRENTLY BE EATING THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL MECHANISM THAT WE ALL HAVE IT'S ONE THAT I THINK IS VERY UNDERAPPRECIATED AND TO DAY I'M GOING TO REVIEW THE DATA FROM BOTH ANIMAL MODELS AND FORTUNATELY MORE RECENTLY HUMAN STUDIES THAT REALLY DO UNDERSCORE THE FACT THAT YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR DESIRE FOR PARTICULAR FOODS BEFORE WE DIVE INTO TO DAY'S TOPIC AND JUST WANTO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON SOME KEY TAKE AWAYS FROM A PREVIOUS EPISODE WHICH IS THE EPISODE ON TIME RESTRICTED FEEDING ALSO CALLED INTERMITTENT FASTING THE KEY ELEMENTS OF TIME RESTRICTED FEEDING THAT WILL BENEFIT YOUR HEALTH THE MOST IN TERMS OF WAIT LOSS OR MAINTENANCE FAT LOSS ORGAN HEALTH QUALITY SLEEP AND COGNITION ARE THAT THE FEEDING WINDOW BEGIN AT LEAST ONE HOUR AFTER WAKING YOU COULD PUSH THAT FEEDING WINDOW OUT TO BEGIN LATER BUT AT LEAST ONE HOUR AFTER WAKING AND THAT IT END AT LEAST TOO AN IDEALLY THREE HOURS BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP SOME PEOPLE CAN END THAT FEEDING WINDOW MUCH FURTHER AWAY FROM THE BEGINNING OF SLEEP MEANING THEIR FINISHING THEIR LAST BITE A FOOD FOR INSTANCE AT SIX P M AND THEY'RE NOT GOIN TO SLEEP UNTIL MIDNIGHT BUT MANY PEOPLE STRUGGLE TO GET QUALITY SLEEP IF THAT FEEDING WINDOW IS SET TWO EARLY RELATIVE TO WHEN THEY GO TO SLEEP SO BEGIN THE FEEDING WINDOW AT LEAST ONE HOUR AFTER WAKING AND THE FEEDING WINDOW AT LEAST TWO HOURS BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP AND A KE FEATURE BASED ON THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IS THAT THE FEEDING WINDOW ITSELF FALL MORE OR LESS AT THE SAME PERIOD OF EACH TWENTY FOUR HOUR DAY FROM DAY TO DAY MEANING IF YOU ARE GOING TO EAT OVER AN EIGHT HOUR PERIOD THAT'S YOUR FEEDING WINDOW YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO START THAT FEEDING WINDOW AT TEN A M ONE DAY AND ENDED AT SIX P M AND THEN THE NEXT DAY START AT NOON AND ANDED AT EIGHT P M AN THE NEXT DAY STARTED AT TWO P M AND ANDED AT TEN P M AND SO FORTH AS MUCH AS IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE IF YOU WANT TO EXTRACT THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT FROM TIME RESTRICTED FEEDING THE IDEA IS TO KEEP THAT FEEDING WINDOW AT MORE OR LESS THE SAME PHASE AS IT'S CALLED OF EACH TWENTY FOUR HOUR DAY IF IT SLIDES AROUND A LITTLE BIT FOR SOCIAL REASONS OR WHATEVER REASONS DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A BIG DEAL BUT YOU DON'T WANT IT SLIDING AROUND BY MANY HOURS FROM DAY TO DAY BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THAT FEEDING WINDOW IMPACTS OTHER GENES CALLED CLOCK GENES THAT REGULATE A BUNCH OF OTHER PROCESSIES IN THE BODY BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTOC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSERING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS ON TH REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH ARE VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GUP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WIH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSERTALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS I GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBICS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRIATH LETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREENSTOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'LL GIE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DATE AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMIND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF WORE GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIENT IN VITEMIN D THREE AND K TWO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARDVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMIND THREE K TO TODAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS S AN ELECTROLITE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLTES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AN ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIA MAGNESIUM IN POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOES ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLIYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IFHYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE AOUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLITES IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENTE DOCT COLM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'L GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THE'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENTE DOT CALM SLASH HUBERME SOME OF THE MOST FREQUENT QUESTIONS I GET ARE ABOUT FOOD AND THE BRAIN EVERYBODY SEEMS TO WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY SHOULD EAT AND WHAT THEY SHOULDN'T EAT IN ORDER TO HAVE PIQ BRAIN FUNCTION TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS AND MAMORIZED THINGS AND SO FORTH AND IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN BRAIN HEALTH OVER TIME BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO LOSE THEIR MEMORY OR HAVE TROUBLES WITH COGNITION FORTUNATELY THERE ARE A LOT OF DATA NOW FROM REALLY GOOD QUALITY PURE REVIEWED STUDIES THAT INDICATE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE CAN DO INCLUDINGS CERTAIN FOODS THAT WE SHOULD EAT AND PERHAPS EVEN SOME FOODS THAT WE SHOULD AVOID IN ORDER TO ENHANCE AR BRAIN FUNCTION AND OF COURSE WHEN I SAY BRAIN WHAT I REALLY MEAN IS NERVOUS SYSTEM FUNCTION BECAUSE HOW WE ARE ABLE TO MOVE AND REMEMBER THINGS ET CETERA DOESN'T JUST DEPEND ON THE NURONS THE NERVE CELLS THAT ARE IN OUR HEAD IT ALSO DEPENDS ON ARE SPINAL CHORD AND THE NURONS THAT CONNECTS ALL THE ORGANS OF OUR BODY SO IN GENERAL THERE ARE TWO CATEGORIES OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO IMPROVE BRAIN HEALTH FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF NUTRITION THE FIRST CATEGORY IS THE GENERAL CATEGORY OF THINGS THAT WE EAT AND AVOID AND THINGS THAT WE DO AND AVOID DOING THAT WILL MODTULATE BRAIN HEALTH AND FUNCTION WHAT DO I MEAN BY MODULATE WELL GETTING QUALITY SLEEP ON A REGULAR BASIS MAKING SURE THAT YOURE SOCIALLY CONNECTED MAKING SURE THAT YOU ARE NOT DEPRESSED ALL THESE THINGS ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT TO OUR OVERALL HEALTH AND OF COURSE THEY WILL IMPACT BRAIN FUNCTION BUT THEY DO IT MORE O LESS INDIRECTLY THERE ARE FEW THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN SLEEP WHICH DIRECTLY BENEFIT BRAIN FUNCTION AND REPAIR ET CETERA BUT TO DAY I REALLY WANT TO CONCENTRATE NOT ON THE THINGS THAT MODULATE ARE OVER ALL HEALTH BUT RATHER THE THINGS THAT MEDIATE BRAIN HEALTH DIRECTLY AND IN PARTICULAR HOW CERTAIN FOODS INHANCE BRAYED FUNCTION AND WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN CHANGE OUR RELATIONSHIP TO FOOD LITERALLY HOW WE CAN START TO PER FIR CERTAIN FOODS THAT ARE BETTER FOR US THAN OTHERS SO JUST BRIEFLY I WANT A TOUCH ON THE MODULATORY COMPONENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE VITAL FIRST OF ALL GETTING QUALITY SLEEP ON A REGULAR BASIS AND AMPLE SLEEP ON A REGULAR BASIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF ALL MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT WE HAVE DONE SEVERAL EPISODES INCLUDING THE MASTERY YOUR SLEEP EPISODE WHICH IS EPISODE TWO OF THE HUBRMON LABPODCAST AND WE'VE DONE A LOT OF OTHER EPISODES THAT ARE ALL ABOUT SLEEP AND HOW TO GET BETTER AT SLEEPING SO I JUST WANT IT MAKE CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT UNLESS YOUR SLEEPING WELL ON A REGULAR BASIS YOUR BRAIN WILL SUFFER YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO FOCUS VERY WELL LEARN VERY WELL AND INDEED THERE ARE DATA LINKING POOR QUALITY SLEEP TO DEMENSHA OR AT LEAST EXASCURBATING PREEXISTING DIMENSIAS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT SO GET YOUR SLEEP IN ORDER THE OTHER OF COURSE IS CARTYOVASCULAR HEALTH AND EXERCISE THE GENERAL PRESCRIPTION THAT OUT THERE IN THE LITERATURE AND I THINK IT'S WELL SUPPORTED IS TO GET SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND A HUNDRED EIGHTY MINUTES OF CARTYOVASCLAR EXERCISE PER WEEK IF YOU CHOOSE TO ALSO USE RESISTANCE EXERCISE THAT'S CRATE BUT THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO A HUNDR AD EIGHTY MINUTE MINIMUM PER WEEK OF CARTYOVASCULAR EXERCISE IS CRUCIAL FOR HEART HEALTH AND HEART HEALTH DIRECTLY RELATES TO BRAIN HEALTH BECAUSE THE BRAIN CONSUMES A LOT OF OXYGEN GLUCOS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE DELIVERED VIO THE BLOOD SO IF YOUR ARTERIES ARE QUAGGED UP AND YOU'VE GOT POOR VASCULAR SUPPLY TO THE BRAIN IN ANY REGION OF THE BRAIN YOUR BRAIN WILL SUFFER SO GET CARTY OVASCULAR HEALTH IN ORDER NOW WITH THOSE TWO MODULATORY ELEMENTS SET FORTH SO THAT WE ARE ALL AWARE THAT THERE THERE AND THEY ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT NOW I LIKE TO TURN TO THE ELEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR DIRECTLY CONTROLLING FOR MEDIATING NURON FUNCTION NURONS OF COURSE ARE NERVE CELLS IN THE BRAIN AND THERE ARE OTHER CELTYPES TO OF COURSE THAT WILL IMPACT BRAIN FUNCTION THE MOST PROMINENT OF WHICH ARE THE SO CALLED GLA GLEA MEANS GLUE BUT EVEN THOUGH FOR A LONG TIME PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THESE CELLS WERE JUST KIND OF HOLDING THINGS TOGETHER PASSIVELY THE GLE UP PLAY A VERY ACTIVE ROLL IN THE METABOLISM NURONS IN BRAIN FUNCTION AND PROBABLY ALSO INCOGNITION IN THINKING AND SO FORTH SO WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT DIRECTLY IMPACT BRAIN HEALTH AND WHAT ARE THE FOODS THAT WE CAN EAT THAT WILL SUPPORT BRAIN HEALTH GENERALLY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT NURON FUNCTION AND BRAIN FUNCTION WE DEFAULT TO A DISCUSSION ABOUT FUEL THE FACT THAT NURONS USE GLUCOSE WHICH IS BLOOD SUGAR IN OR AND THAT THEY REQUIRE A LOT OF IT IN SOME CASES THEY WILL USE KEYTONES WHICH WE WILL TALK ABOUT A LIOBIT LATER SPECIALLING PEOPLE THAT ARE FOLLOWING A LOW CARBOHYDRATE OR QUITOGENIC DIET BUT BEFORE WE CAN EVEN CONSIDER THE FUELS THAT NURONS USE IN ORDER TO FUNCTION WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE ELEMENTS THAT ACTUALLY ALLOW THOSE NURONS TO BE THERE AND TO STAY HEALTHY WHAT ACTUALLY MAKES UP THOSE NRONS AND THAT BRINGS US TO WHAT I WOULD AR ARGUE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FOOD ELEMENT FOR BRAIN FUNCTION AND THAT IS FAT AND THAT MAY COME AS A SUPPRISE BUT UNLESS ONE CONSIDERS THE WATER CONTENT OF THE BRAIN WHICH IS VERY HIGH A LOT OF OUR BRAIN AND A LOT OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE NERVE CELLS THE SO CALLED NURONS IN OUR BRAIN AND THE OTHER TYPES OF CELLS COMES FROM FAT AND THAT'S BECAUSE NERVE CELLS AND OTHER CELLS IN THE BRAIN HAVE A EXTERNAL LAYER ITS WHAT SOMETIMES CALLED A DOUBLE LAYERED MEMBRAIN IT THE SENTIARLY TWO THIN LAYERS THAT SERVE AS A BOUNDARY BETWEEN THOM CELLS AND THAT BOUNDARY IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE HOW THINGS PASS ACROSS THAT BOUNDARY ACTUALLY REGULATES THE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY OF NURONS WHICH IS THE WAY THAT NURONS FIRE AND COMMUNICATE AND KEEP YOU THINKING AND ACTING AND DOING ALL THE GOOD THINGS TO THOSE NURONS ALLOW US TO DO AND THOSE MEMBRANES ARE MADE UP OF FATS BUT THEY'RE NOT MADE UP OF THE FATS THAT ARE AROUND OUR BELLY ROUND THE OTHER ORGANS OF OUR BODY THEY'RE NOT MADE UP OF STORAGE FAT THEY ARE MADE UP OF STRUCTURAL FAT AND MAINTAINING THE SO CALLED INTEGRITY OF THAT STRUCTURAL FAT MEANING THE HEALTH OF THOSE NURONS IS GOING TO COME IN LARGE PART FROM THE FOODS THAT WE EAT NOW THIS NEEDS TO BE UNDER SCORED WHAT I AM SAYING IS THAT THE FOODS THAT WE EAT ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE STRUCTURAL BASIS THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE VERY NURONS THAT ALLOW US TO THINK OVER TIME AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE FAT THAT MAKES UP THOSE NURONS AND OTHER NERVE CELLS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER TYPES OF FAT IN THE BODY SO WHAT TYPE OF FAT IS IT AND WHAT SHALL WE EAT IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THAT FAT AND THOSE NURONS AND THE ANSWER IS THE SO CALED ESSENTIAL FATIACIDS AND FOSSPAL LIPPITS NOW THOSE ARE MORE OR LESS THE SAME THING BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE A VERY LARGE LITERATURE VERY CRYSTAL CLEAR ESSENTIAL FATIACIDS CAN INCLUDE THE SO CALLED E P A VARIETY OR D A CH  VARIETY YOU HEAREABOUT OMEGATHREES AND OMEGASIXES MOST PEOPLE ARE GETTING ENOUGH OMEGASIXES FROM THEIR DIET NOT EVERYBODY BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE GETTING ENOUGH O MEGASIXES HOWEVER MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING ENOUGH OMGATHREES IN THEIR DIET TO SUPPORT HEALTHY BRAIN FUNCTION IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM I'VE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF ELEVATING THE LEVELS OF OMEGATHREES IN ONE STIET FOR SAKE OF OFFSETTING DEPRESSION AND FOR ENHANCING MOOD AND INDEED THEREIS A WEALTH OF LITERATURE NOW POINTING TO THE FACT THAT INGESTING AT LEAST ONE OR TWO OR EVEN THREE GRAMS PER DAY OF E P A FORM OF ESSENTIAL FATIACID CAN HAVE EFFECTS POSIVE EFFECTS ON MOOD AND WELL BEING THAT ARE AT LEAST ON PAR WITH SOME OF THE MAJOR ANTODEPRESSENT TREATMENTS OUT THERE BUT WITHOUT SIMILAR SIDE EFFECTS TO THOSE ANTADEPRESSENT TREATMENTS AND THAT FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY TAKING INTO DEPRESSENS THAT SUPPLEMENTING WITH ONE TO TWO TO THREE GRAMS OF E P A ESSENTIAL FATIACIDS CAN ACTUALLY ALLOW A LOWER DOSE OF ANTODEPRESSENT TREATMENT TO BE USED AND STILL BE EFFECTIVE SO THATS DEPRESSION BUT JUST IN TERMS OF MAINTAINING NORMAL COGNIVE FUNCTION IN PEOPLE THAT A REN'T DEPRESSED THE E P S AND OMEGATHREES SEEM TO PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT ROLL OF COURSE YOU CAN SUPPLEMENT E P S THROUGH VARIOUS FISH OILS AND A CB LIQUID FISH OIL OR CAPSAL FISH OIL SOME PEOPLE IF THERE A NOT INTERESTED IN EATING FISH FOR WHATEVER REASON THEIR LERGIC OR FOR ETHICAL REASONS THEY CAN TAKE CRILL OIL IF THEY DON'T WANT TO USE CRILL OIL THEY CAN USE ALGY IN OTHER FORMS OF E P  HOWEVER I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT ONE CAN GET A LOT OF E P  FROM THE PROPER FOODS AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THOSE FOODS NOT SURPRISINGLY DON'T JUST CONTAIN HIGH LEVELS OF E P  BUT THEY ALSO CONTAIN OTHER THINGS THAT ARE BENEFICIAL FOR BRAIN HEALTH SO WHAT ARE FOODS THAT ARE HIGH IN OMEGATHREES THAT WE SHOULD ALL PROBABLY BE CONSUMING AT LEAST ON A DAILY BASIS THE NUMBER ONE IS FISH SO THINGS LIKE MACKREL AND SAMON AND HARRING IN OYSTERS AND SARDINES AND ANCHOVIES AND PERHAPS THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF E P S PER UNIT VOLUME IS CAVIAR NOW I DO'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I'M NOT EATING A LOT OF FISH I'M NOT EATING A LOT OF CAVIAR I DON'T THINK I CAN REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I HAD A CAVIAR UNLESS IT WAS SPRINKLED ON A LOBIT OF SUCI I'M NOT A BIG A FISH EATER PERSONALLY I WILL FROM TIME TO TIME BUT THAT'S ONE REASON WHY ONE MIGHT WANT TO SUPPLEMENT WITH E P S FROM ANOTHER SOURCE BUT ALSO E P S ARE FOUND IN CHIASEEDS IN WALNUTS IN SOY BEINES AND OTHER PLANT BASE FOODS YOU CAN LOOK THESE UP ON LINE AND YOU'LL IMMEDIATELY SEE THAT THEREARE LOT OF SOURCES OF E P S AND MANY OF THE FOODS THAT I LISTED OFF MIGHT BE APPETIZING TO YOU SOME OF THEM MIGHT BE UNAPPETIZING TO YOU OR SOME OF THEM YOU MIGHT BE SORT OF NEUTRAL ABOUT BUT IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT EATING FOODS THAT ARE RICH IN OMEGATHREES AND OR SUPPLEMENTING WITH OMEGATHREES TO GET ABOVE THAT ONE POINT FIVE GRAMS AND IDEALLY UP TO TWO OR EVEN THREE GRAMS PER DAY OF E P  CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR COGNIVE FUNCTION IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM LATER IN THE EPISODE I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO ACTUALLY CHANGE YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO PARTICULAR FOOD SO THAT FOODS THAT YOU DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE YOU CAN ACTUALLY START TO LIKE MORE AND THAT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE THINKING MACERAL SARDINES  IN THISABAT I MAKING THE SPHACE CAUSE FRANKLY THOSE ARE NOT FOODS THAT I NATURALLY LIKE BUT AGAIN I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONSUME FISH AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS IN ORDER TO GET SUFFICIENT E P ES YOU CAN GET THEM FROM PLANTS BUT I DO BELIEVE BASED ON THE QUALITY PE REVIEWED RESEARCH THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE STRIVING TO GET A MINIMUM THRESHOLD OF AT LEAST A GRAM AND A HALF OF E P S PER DAY ONE WAY OR THE OTHER THE GREAT THING ABOUT OMEGATHREES IS THAT THEY ARE ALSO THOUGHT TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR THINGS LIKE CARTY OF ASCULAR HEALTH AND ALTHOUGH THERE SOME CONTROVERSY THERE AS TO WEATHER OR NOT TWO GRAMS ARE THREE GRAMS OR SIX GRAMS AS IDEAL FOR CARTY OVASCULAR HEALTH I THINK THE BULK OF EVIDENCE POINTS TO THE FACT THE GETTING SUFFICIENT OMEGATHREES IN THE DIET IS GOING TO SUPPORT CARTY OF ASCULAR HEALTH CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY THING PEOPLE SHOULD BE DOING TO SUPPORT THEIR CARTY OF ASCULAR HEALTH A ROBIC EXERCISE AND SO FORTH BEING IMPORTANT ALSO BUT IT DOES SEEM TO SUPPORT COLER VASCULAR HEALTH AND IN DOING SO SUPPORTING BRAINHEALTH HOWEVER WHAT I'M EMPHASIZING IS INGESTION OF OMAGATHREES TO SUPPORT THE VERY CELLS WITHIN THE BRAIN THAT MAKE UP OUR COGNITION THAT ALLOW FOR COGNITION AND FOM MOVEMENT AND MEMORY AND ALL THE OTHER MARVELLOUS THINGS THAT THE BRAIN DOES THE OTHER COMPOUND THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE DIRECTLY SUPPORTIVE OF NAURONAL FUNCTION IS PHOSPHOTITAL SYRINE WHICH IS ABUNDANT IN MEATS AND IN FISH SO HERE WE ARE AGAIN BACK TO FISH BEING AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF BRAINS SHUPPORTING FOOD PHOSPHOTITAL SYRING IS SOMETHING THAT NOWADAYS PEOPLE ARE SUPPLEMENTING IT'S A LIPID LIKE COMPOUND THAT AT LEAST IN THREE STUDIES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE COGNITION THESE WEREN'T HUGE EFFACTS BUT THEY WORSTATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS AND AS WELL IN MORE THAN THREE AT LEAST AT LEAST FIVE STUDIES TO REDUCE COGNIVE DECLINE D THIS IS INTERESTING IN EVERY CASE IT WAS THREE HUNDRED MELIGRAMS SUPPLEMENTED PHOSPHOTITAL SYRIN BUT ONE AGAIN DOESN'T NEED TO SUPPLEMENT PHOSPHOTITAL SYRIN PHOSPHOTITAL SYRING CAN BE DERIVED AS I MENTION FROM MEETS IN FISH AND TO SOME EXTENT FROM CABBAGE OF ALL THINGS I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH CABBAGE PEOPLE ARE INGESTING BUT LATER WHEN WE TALK ABOUT GOT HEALTH AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOT HEALTH AND BRAINHEALTH I'LL MENTION FERMENTED FOODS AND OF COURSE ONE OF THE MOST A READILY AVAILABLE FERMENTED FOODS OUT THERE THAT AT LEAST MANY PEOPLE FIND APPETIZING IS SOUER CROUT WHICH IS OF COURSE MADE FROM CABBAGES FOR MENTED CABBAGE SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DO CONSUME MEAT AND FISH PROVIDED YOUR GETTING ENOUGH FISH YOURE PROBABLY GETTING ENOUGH PHOSPHOTITAL SYRIN FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE INTERESTIN SUPPLEMENTING PHOSPHOTITAL YRINE TO GET THESE EFFECTS THAT WERE REPORTED IN THESE VARIOUS MANUSCRIPTS WHICH BY THE WAY AVE READ AND LOOK SOLID I BEEN I DON'T THINK WE'VE SEEN THE LANDMARK STUDIES SHOWING THAT SUPPLEMENTING WITH PHOSPHOTITAL YRIANE AT THREE HUNDRED MELIGRAMS PERDAY IS GOING TO CREATE A A HUGE OFFSETTING OF A MASSIVE COGNIVE DECLINE OR A MASSIVE INCREASE IN BRAIN FUNCTION THESE SEEM TO BE MODEST OFFACTS BUT THE EFFECTS DO APPEAR TO BE REAL AND I FOR THOSE OFYOUTHER ARE INTERESTIN SUPPLEMNTING PHOSPHOTITAL SYRING IT'S A RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE SUPPLEMENT THAT AGAIN IS LIPID LIKE SO IT'S MIMICING SOME OF THE SAME THINGS THAT YOU WOULD GET FROM FOOD BUT IN HIGHER CONCENTRATION NOW AFTER E PE FATIASIDS AND PHOSPHOTITAL SYRI I WOULD SAY THIRD ON THE LIST OF THINGS THAT COME FROM FOOD THAT CAN READILY SUPPORT BRAIN FUNCTION WOULD BE COALING AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIP TO COALINE IN THE BIOSYNTHESIS PATHWAY FOR A SEEDAL COALING A SDAL COALING IS A NEUROMODULATOR NOT ANERROW TRANSMITTER BUT A NEUROMODULATOR IN THE BRAIN A NEUROMODULATOR IS A CHEMICAL THAT MODULATES THE FUNCTION OF MANY BRAIN CIRCUITS AND ALSO CIRCUITS WITHIN THE BODY I MENTION WHAT THOSE ARE IN A MOMENT BUT A SEETAL COALING AS A NEUROMODULATOR TENDS TO ENHANCE THE ACTIVITY THE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY IN CHEMICAL ACTIVITY OF CERTAIN SETS OF NURONS AND DOWN PLAY THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER NURONS SO IT SORT OF A CONDUCTER OF SOURTS LEADING TO ENHANCED FUNCTION AN ACTIVITY IN CERTAIN BRAIN AREAS AN CIRCUTS AND NOT IN OTHERS FOR INSTANCE THE BRAIN AREAS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN FOCUS AND ALERTNESS WE HAVE MULTIBLE CLUSTERS OF NURONS IN OUR BRAIN THAT MAKE A SEDO COLING TWO OF THE MOST PROMINENT AND WELL KNOWN OF SO CALL NUCLIOUS BASALUS WHICH IS A CLUSTER OF NURONS DEEP IN THE BAZALFOR BRAIN THAT HIGHLIGT PARTICULAR AREAS OF OUR BRAIN HIGHLIGHT MEANING A WHEN ASEDO COLING IS RELEASED FROM THOSE NURONS AT THEIR NERVE ENDINGS IN PARTICULAR AREAS THE BRAIN THOSE PARTICULAR ARAS OF THE BRAIN CAN UNDERGO ENHANCED LEVELS OF ACTIVITY RELATIVE TO SURROUNDING AREA SO ITS KAN OF A ELECTRICAL HIGHLIGHT OR PEN IF YOU WILL BY ANALOGY THAT IS THE BASIS OF MUCH OF WHAT WE CALL FOCUS ARE OR OUR ABILITY TO CONCENTRATE ON A PARTICULAR BATCH OF INFORMATION THAT'S COMING IN THROUGH OUR EYES OUR EARS OUR NOSE OR EVEN THINGS THAT WERE JUST THINKING IN OUR HEAD SO HAVING AMPLE COALING FOR PRODUCTION OF A SEDAL COALING ALLOWS FOR FOCUS THROUGH OF COURSE MANY INTERVENING STEPS THERE ARE ALSO REGIONS OF THE BRAIN IN THE SO CALLED BACK OF TE BRAIN THE HIND BRAIN THAT RELEASE A SEDOCOALING THAT ARE INVOLVED IN GENERAL STATES OF ALERTNESS AND NOT SURPRISINGLY THEN MANY OF THE TREATMENTS FOR ALCIMERS DISEASE WHICH IS IN A BI INABILITY OR CHALLENGES WITH REMEMBERING THINGS AND FOCUSING OR DRUGS THAT IMPACT THE ASEDO COALING PATHWAY AND ARE AIMED AT ENHANCING THE AMOUNT OF A SEDOCOLING THAT'S AVAILABLE TO NURONS AND IT CAN DO THAT THROUGH NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MECHANISMS YOU CAN DO THAT BY ENHANCING THE AMOUNT OF A SEDOCOALING THAT'S CREATED OR YOU CAN DO THAT BY OF TAKING A DRUG THAT CAN REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF ENZIME THAT GOBBLES UP THE ACEDAL COLING AND IN DOING SO LEADING TO MORE NET ASEDO COLING BUT OUTSIDE OF THE CENAREO WHERE SOMEBODY HAS COGNIVE DECLINE DUE TO ALCIMERS ALL OF US ARE ABLE TO FOCUS TO SOME DEGREE OR NOT OR ARE ABLE TO BE ALERT TO SOME DEGREE OR NOT BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF A SEDO COALING THAT WE HAVE NOW OTHER PROCESSES OF COURSE ARE INVOLVED BUT WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH OF THE SUBSTRATES TO CREATE A SEDAL COALING IS VITAL IF WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS AND THAT'S WHY DIETARY COALING IS SO VITAL AND THE PRIMARY SOURCE FOR DIETARY COALING WOULD BE EGGS AND IN PARTICULAR EGG YOKES AND THIS AGAIN HAS A VERY INTERESTING RELATIONSHIP TO OUR EVOLUTION AS WELL WE'RE ALWAYS REFERRED TO HITS HUNTER GATHERS  OM BUT WHEN ONE HEARS HUNTERS WE OFTEN THINK ABOUT MEAT AND ANIMAL SOURCES AND INDEED AS A SPECIES WE HUNTED A MANY MANY A OTHER SPECIES OF ANIMALS TO CONSUME THEM AND STILL DO BUT WE ALSO FISH WE TALKE ABOUT THAT EARLIER AND CONSUMED A LOT OF FISH AND WE CANSUMED A LOT OF EGGS EGGS ARE AN INCREDIBLY RICH SOURCE OF NEUTREANTS FOR THE BRAIN AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE EGG ACTUALLY IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT CONTAINS ALL THE NEUTRIENTS THAT ARE REQUIRED IN ORDER FOR AN ORGANISM TO GROW YOU KNOW IT A BIRD THAT'S IN IT IN A EGGSHELL IT'S GOT THE YOKE THERE AN ITS USING THAT OAK YOKE FOR REASON ITS USING THAT YOKE AS A SOURCE OF FUEL IT'S USING THAT YOKE AS A SOURCE OF LITERALLY BUILDING BLOCKS IN ORDER TO CREATE ITS NERVOUS SYSTEM MANY YEARS AGO I WORKED ON CHICK EMBRYOS AND AS THESE AMAZING EXPERIMENTS YOU COULD ACTUALLY TAKEN AN EGG AND YOU COULD CREATE A LITTLE WINDOW IN THE TOP AND THESE WERE FERTILIZED EGGS AND YOU'D SEE OVER TIME YOU COULD PEER IN THERE LITTERALLY LOOK IN WITH A MICROSCOPE OR EVEN WITH THE NAKED EYE AND YOU WOULD SEE THIS LITTLE CHICK EMBRYO SITTING ON TOP OF THAT YOKE GROWING AND GROWING AND GROWING AND GROWING IN THE THE YOKE GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER S REALLY A INCREDIBLE THEY'RE USING THAT IS A SOURCE FOR ALL THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE BODY BUT IN PARTICULAR THE NERVOUS SYSTEM SO EGGS ARE A RICH SOURCE OF COALING SOME PEOPLE WILL SUPPLEMENT WITH COALING HOWEVER FOOD SOURCES SEEM TO BE THE BEST SOURCE OF COALING AND AS WITH THE E PES AND THE OMEGATHREES THERE ARE PLENTY OF FOODS THAT ARE NON ANIMAL BASED THAT CONTAIN COALING SO IF YOURE SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T EAT EGGS OR DOESN'T WANT TO ET EGGS THINGS LIKE POTATOES NOTS AND SEEDS AND GRAINS AND FRUIT THEY DON'T HAVE AS MUCH COALING AS EGGS BUT THEY DO CONTAIN COALING SO YOU CAN LOOK UP THE VALUES OF COALING THAT ARE O PRESENT IN THOSE VARIOUS FOODS AN MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE REACHING THE THRESHOLD AMOUNT OF COALINE FOR YOU IN GENERAL MOST PEOPLE SHOULD PROBABLY STRIVE TO GET SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS AND A GRAM OF COALINE PER DAYS OR THOUSAND MILIGRAMS AND SOME PEOPLE RELY ON SUPPLEMENTATION IN ORDER TO HIT THOSE LEVELS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT EATING A LOT OF EG YOKES ARE THERE NOT EATING A LOT OF OTHER FOODS ON CERTAIN FISH CONTAIN O COALING FOR INSTANCE AND THE OTHER FOODS I LISTED OFF A FEW MINUTES AGO FROM PLANTBASE SOURCES SO SOME PEOPLE OF SUPPLEMENT WITH FIFTY TO A HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OR WHATEVER AMOUNT IS NECESSARY TO GET THEM UP TO THAT ONE GRAMER EVEN A TWO GRAM DOSE PER DAY SO WE HAVE THREE THINGS THAT WE KNOW CAN SUPPORT NERVE CELLS E PE IN PARTICULAR MEGATHREE FATIACIDS PHOSPHOTHIDAL SERING AND COALING THOSE THREE THINGS I WOULD LIST OFF AS THE TOP THREE THINGS FOR INHANCING NURON FUNCTION AND THE INTEGRITY OF NURONS IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM AND THIS IS AGAIN IS SETTING ASIDE THE VITALLY IMPORTANT FACTORS OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLITES I'VE SET IT BEFORE ANOTHER PODCASTS BUT IF YOU'RE NOT INJESTING ENOUGH WATER AND YOU'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH SODIUM AND MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THAND OBVIOUSLY YOUR NURONS CAN'T RUN BECAUSE A LOT OF THE BRAIN IS IS WATER YOU NEED TO MAINTAIN PROPER HYDRATION AND SODIUM POTASSUM AN MAGNESIUM ARE IMPORTANT IN ORDER FOR NERVECELLS TO FUNCTION THEY ARE ACTUALLY THE A COMPONENTS THE IONS THAT PASS ACROSS THOSE LIPID MEMBRANES THOSE THOSE LITTLE FATTY MEMBRANES THAT WERE TALK ABOUT EARLIERE THAT ALLOW THE NURONS TO GENERATE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY IN COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER SO DEFINLLY YOU WANT TO HYDRATE ENOUGH WILL WE WILL DO AN ENTIRE OTHER EPISODE ALL ABOUT HYDRATION AND ELECTROLITES BUT OMEGATHREES THE E P S PHOSPHOTITAL SERING AND COALING IT'S OBVIOUS ARE G ING TO IMPROVE BRAIN FUNCTION HOW MUCH THEY WIL IPROVE BRAING FUNCTION PROBABLY DEPENDS ON HOW WELL YOUR BRAIN WAS WORKING PREVIOUSLY IN FACT MANY OF THE STUDIES THAT HAVE LOOKED AT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE COMPOUNDS HAVE LOOKED IN PEOPLE THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM MILD OR EVEN SEVERE COGNA OF DECLINE AND WHILE THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE STUDIES VERY GIVN THE INTEREST IN MAINTAINING BRAIN FUNCTION GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE DON'T MAKE NEW NURANS THROUGHOUT ARE ENTIRE LIFE AND GIVEN THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO EAT THESE ARE QUALITY HEALTHY FOODS THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE INJESTING ANY WAYS AND IT'S CLEAR THAT THEY CAN SUPPORT BRAIN FUNCTION TO SOME DEGREE OR ANOTHER MANY PEOPLE ASK WHAT I DO IN LIGHT OF THIS INFORMATION AND WHILE I CAN ONLY TALK ABOUT WHAT WORKS FOR ME I CHOOSE TO INJEST FISH OIL IN MAINLY IN LIQUID FORM BECAUSE THAT TURNS OUT TO BE A THE EASIEST WAY IN THE MOST A ECONOMICALLY A AFFORDABLE WAY TO DO IT FOR MOST PEOPLE A SO THERE ARE VARIOUS FORMS HAVE LIQUID FISH OIL OUT THERE SOME OF THEM INCLUDE SOME LEMON FLAVORING SO IT DOESN'T TASTE LIKE FISH OIL BECAUSE FRANKLY FISH OIL TO ME I SORT OF NOXIOUS DASTING AND I'LL TAKE THE TABLE SPOON OF THAT OR TWO PER DAY A IF I'M TRAVELING I'LL USE THE CAPSIL FORM IN ORDER TO HIT THAT THRESHOLD OF FOR ME ABOUT TWO SOMETIMES EVEN THREE GRAMS PER DAY OF E P A SO NOT JUST TWO OR THREE GRAMS PER DAY OF FISH OIL BUT TWO OR THREE GRAMS PER DAY OF E P  NOW IF I'M EATING FISH A WHICH AS I MENTION EARLIER IS NOT OFTEN THEN I MIGHT REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FISH OIL THAT I TAKE BUT THAT'S MY MAJOR SOURCE OF FISH OIL CURRENTLY I DO NOT SUPPLEMENT WITH PHOSPHOTITAL SERING A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT I KNOW IN TRUST AND INDEED SEVERAL COLLEAGUES OF MINE A DO TAKE PHOSHOTITAL SYRING I DON'T HAVE ANY GOOD EXPLANATION FOR WHAT I DON'T TAKE IT YET A BUT I HAVE NOT TRIED SUPPLEMENTING WITH IT YET MAY BE OF SOME OF YOU HAVE YOU CAN A PLACE YOUR EXPERIENCE A IN THE COMMENT SECTION UT WOULD BE OF INTEREST AND THEN IN TERMS OF COALING I IN ORDER TO GET COALING IN MY DIET I DO PAY ATTENTION TO THE VARIOUS FOODS THAT CONTAIN COLING AND I TRY AND GET THOSE FOOD ON A SEMI REGULAR BASIS I DO SUPPLEMENT WITH SOMETHING CALLED ALPHAG P C WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY IN THE SEET E COLING PATHWAY OR BY ASYNTHESIS PATHWAY I DON'T TAKE IT VERY OFTEN BUT I WILL TAKE THREE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF ALPHAC P C FROM TIME TO TIME FROM TIME TO TIME I MEAN ANYWHERE FROM A TWO TO THREE TIMES PER WEEK I'LL GENERALLY DO IT EARLY IN THE DAY CAUSE IT FOR ME CAN HAVE A LOW BIT OF A STIMULANT EFFECT ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT NEARLY A ESTIMULATING SAY IS A DOUBLEST RESOR TRIPLES PRESSO BUT THAT'S ONE WAY IN WHICH I ENHANCE MY COLING FUNCTION AND SOME PEOPLE CHOOSE TO GET IT FROM SUPPLEMENTATION BECAUSE IT STRAIGHTFORWARD THERE ARE LOT O SUPPLEMENTS OUT THERE THAT CONTAIN ALPHAC P C SOME PEOPLE ARE TAKING DOSAGES AS HIGH AS NINE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS PER DAY THAT SOUNDS VERY HIGH TO ME THAT THE STUDIES OF OFFSETTING COGNAOF DECLINE USING ALPHAC P C DID USE QUITE HIGH A DOSAGES OF SIX HUNDRED TO NINE HUNDRED OR EVEN TWELVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS PER DAY SO IT HAS BEEN USED THAT THOSE MUCH HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS BUT A BECAUSE FORTUNATELY AT LEAST NOT YET OR NOT TO MY WARENESS I'M NOT SUFFERING FROM ANY COGNIVE DECLINE I WILL SUPPLEMENT WITH THREE HUNDRED MELEGRAMS EVERY NOW AND AGAIN NEXT OME MY LIST OF COMPOUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN IN PURE REVIEWED RESEARCH TO IMPROVE NORONAL AN BRAIN FUNCTION IS CREATINE CREATINE CAN BE DERIVED FROM MEAT SOURCES IT CAN ALSO BE SUPPLEMENTED SOME OF YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH CRETINE OR HEARD ABOUT CREATINE FROM THE CONTEXT OF THE HEALTH AND FITNESS WORLD WHERE REATING IS USED TO BRING MORE WATER IN TO MUSCLES WHICH CAN ENHANCE THE STRENGTH OF THOSE MUSCLES AS WELL AS BRING WATER INTO OTHER TISSUES HO DOSN'T JUST DRAW MORE WATER INTO MUSCLE I CAN AW MORE WATER INTO THE BODY GENERALLY CREATINE HAS ALSO BEN SHOWN TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN BRAIN FUNCTION AND ONCE AGAIN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAME UP DURING THE DISCUSSION ABOUT DEPRESSION A FEW EPISODES BACK CREATINE CAN ACTION BE USED AS A FUEL SOURCE IN THE BRAIN AND IT THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE THAT IT CAN ENHANCE THE FUNCTION OF CERTAIN A FRONTAL CORTICAL CIRCUITS THAT FEED DOWN ON TO OR RATHER CONNECT TO ARRIES O THE BRAIN THAT INVOLVED IN MOOD REGULATION AND MOTIVATION AND THAT'S WHERE CREATINE PLACE A ROLEL IN DEPRESSION OR RATHER WHERE CRETING SUPPLEMENTATION SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST IN SOME FORMS OF MILD DEPRESSION THAT'S AN EMERGING LITERATURE STILL NOT WELL ESTABLISHED HOWEVER THERE IS NOW AMPLE EVIDENCE THAT CREATING SUPPLEMENTATION CAN ENHANCSPRAIN FUNCTION IN CERTAIN CONTAXTS AND IF YOUARE INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT WHAT THOSE CONTACTS ARE THERE'S AN EXCELLENT REVIEW THAT JUST CAME OUT THE FIRST AUTHOR IS A RUH CHELL ARE O S C H YLL WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THE STUDY A RATHER THIS REVIEW SCUWS ME IN A THE CAPTION A THIS WAS PUBLISH JUST VERY RECENTLY IN A TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ONE THING TO MAKE CLEAR IS THAT CREATINE SUPPLEMENTATION HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE ESPECIALLY USEFUL FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT CONSUMING ANY MEAT OR OTHER SOURCES OF FOODS THAT ARE RICH IN CREATINE WHAT IS THE THRESHOLD LEVEL OF CREATINE TO SUPPLEMENT IN ORDER TO GET THE COGNIVE BENEFIT PEARS TO BE AT LEAST FIVE GRAHAMS PER DAY NOT THE MOST TYPICAL FORM OF CRETINE AS SOCAL CREATINE MONOHYDRATE THERE ARE OTHER FORMS OF CREATINE AS WELL SOME OF WHICH ARE THOUGHT TO NOT DRAW AS MUCH WATER INTO NON MUSCLE TISSUES AND FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT THE ATTRACTIVE TO THEM THEY DON'T WANT WATER SITTING BELOW THEIR SKIN ET CETERA I SHOULD EMPHASIZE THAT THE RESPONSES TO CREATINE IN THAT SENSE CAN DIFFER SOME PEOPLE GET A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT WATER ATTENTION SOME PEOPLE EXPERIENCE MORE I THERE SOME EVIDENCE THAT CREATINE CAN IMPACT SOME OF THE HORMONAL PATHWAYS THAT IT MIGHT ENHANCE LEVELS SO SO CALLED DIHYDROTESTOSTRONE D H T AND THEREFORE BECAUSE T H T IS INVOLVED IN HAIR LOST THERE ARE THESE THEORIES THAT CREATINE CAN CAUSE HAIR LOSS AND INDEED FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY DEHED SENSITIVE IT MIGHT YOU KNOW A THERE 'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF VARIATION PERSON TO PERSON TERMS OF HOW MUCH CREATINE IMPACTS D H T AND HOW MANY D H T RECEPTORS THEY HAVE ON THEIR SCALP AND THEREFORE WHETHER NOT THEY EXPERIENCE HAIR LOST I'M JUST GIVING YOU ALL THIS INFORMATION SO THAT YOUR AWARE OF THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT CREATING CAN DO BUT NONE THE LESS I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT CRETING SUPPLEMENTATION OF FIVE GRAMS PER DAY THAT'S CREATING MONOHYDRATE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE COGNITION ON PEOPLE THAT AREN'T GETTING CRETINE FROM ANIMAL SOURCES AND THERE SOME EVIDENCE DETAILED WITHIN THE REVIEW THAT I JUST DESCRIBED THAT CREATINE SUPPLEMENTATION CAN ALSO ENHANCE COGNITION IN PEOPLE THAT ARE ALSO EATING ANIMAL PRODUCTS SO I PERSONALLY TAKE CREATINE FIVE GRAMS PER DAY AND HAVE FOR A VERY LONG TIME I CAN'T SAY THAT I'VE A NOTICED A TREMENDOUS BENEFIT BECAUSE I'VE ACTUALLY NEVER REALLY COME OFF IT AH AND SO I'VE NEVER DONE THE CONTROL EXPERIMENT I TAKE IT MORE AS KIND OF A BASE LINE INSURANCE POLICY FOR ME A I'M PROBABLY LOSING I'M CERTAINLY LOSING SOME OF MY HAIR WHETHER NOT THAT'S DUE TO CREATING OR NOT A I'VE NEVER DONE A THE ANALYSIS BUT A WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT I GENERALLY CONSUME THESE THINGS LIKE E PES CREATINE ALPHAG P C TO SET A GENERAL CONTEXT OF SUPPORT FOR MY NURONS A FOR MY BRAIN AND OF COURSE I ALSO PA ATTENTION ON THE FOODS THAT CONTAIN THESE VARIOUS COMPOUNDS SO I DON'T ACTIVELY EAT ADDITIONAL MEAT JUST TO OBTAIN CREATINE A I EAT A FAIRLY LIMITED AMOUNT OF MEAT I DON'T RESTRICT IT BUT I AND I DO EAT MEAT BUT A I DON'T ACTIVELY SEEK OUT CREATING IN MY DIET RATHER I USE SUPPLEMENTATION IN IN ORDER TO HIT THAT FIVEGRAMS PERDAY THRESHOLD NEXT ON THE LIST OF FOODS THAT ARE BENEFICIAL FOR BRAINHEALTH IS ONE THAT YOU PROBALYCINE PICTURES OF ON LINE BECAUSE THERE SEEMS TO BE A PRACTICE OF PUTTING PICTURES OF BLUEBERRIES AND OTHER DARK BERRIES NEXT TO ANY TITLE THAT SAYS FOODS THAT BENEFIT YOUR BRAIN THERE ARE A LOT OF FOODS OUT THERE THAT HAVE BEEN PURPORTED TO IMPROVE BRAIN FUNCTION THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT BLUEBERRIES AND OTHER BERRIES BLACKBERRIES DARK CURRENTS ANY OF THESE THIN SKIN BERRIES THAT ARE PURPLISH IN COLOR IS THAT THEY CONTAIN WHAT ARE CALLED ANTHOSIONINS AND THE SIONANS ACTUALLY HAVE SOME REALLY NICE DATA TO SUPPORT THE FACT THAT THEY IMPROVE BRAIN FUNCTION NOW WHETHER OR NOT IT IS DIRECT EFFECTS ON NURANS OR WHETHER NOT IS BY LOWERING INFLAMMATION A WER SOME OTHER MODULATORY AF FACT ISN'T QUITE CLEAR BUT BY NOW THEREIS ENOUGH DATA TO SUPPORT THE FACT THAT EATING A CUP OR TWO OF BLUEBERRIES PRETTY OFTEN EVERY DAY OR MAYBE YOU A BLACKBERRIES OR MAYBE ITS BLACK CURRENTS THAT THESE ANTHOSIONYNS ARE ARE GOOD FOR US THAT THEY ARE ENHANCING OUR OVER ALL WELL BEING AT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LEVELS AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF WEAR THE ARE ACTUALLY PURE REVIEWED STUDIES TO SUPPORT THOSE STATEMENTS THE ANTHOSIONNS OF WHICH BLUEBERRIES AND OTHER DARK BERRIES ARE RICH IN A HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF D'ANA DAMAGE HAS BEEN CHOWN TO REDUCE SIGNIFICANTLY ALTHOUGH AL BE IT SLIGHTLY SCUSE ME COGNIVE TE CLINE A AND THAT PARTICULAR STUDY WAS SUPPLEMENTATION OF A BLU EBERRY EXTRACT I'LL TALK ABOUT THE DFFERECE BUTEN EXTRACT AN ACTUAL BLUEBERRIES IN MOMENT BUT SUPPLEMENT TO TATION OF BLUEBERRY EXTRACT IN OFFSETTING COGNAIVE DECLINE IN ELDERLY PEOPLE SO A YOU KNOW WHAT CONSTITUTES ELDERLY IS ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT OF A OF A DEBATE IN A DISCUSSION BUT IN THIS CASE WHAT THEY WHAT THEY DID IS THEY SUPPLEMENTED WITH SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT I DO' KNW WHY THEY SELECTED FOR HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT AND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT MILIGRAMS OF ANTHOSIONANS DAILY FOR TWELVE WEEKS WAS ASSOCIATE WITH IMPROVEMENTS ON VERBAL LEARNING A MEMORY A AND THEY HAD SOME OTHER BENEFICIAL CHANGES THAT WERE WITHIN THE BODILY ORGANS A IN BLOOD BLUE COAST A REGULATION SO FORTH POSITIVE CHANGES BUT THAT'S ONE STUDY IN THIS CASE A ELDERLY MEANT SIXTY FIVE OR OLDER A THAT STUDY AND A NUMBER OF STUDIES LIKE IT LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE MILDLY ENHANCED MEMORY A REDUCED INSOLEN LEVELS A REDUCED OXIDATION OF ELDEL THESE SORTS OF THINGS HAVE BASICALLY CREATE A SITUATION WHERE ANY TIME YOU GUGEL OR LOOK UP A FOOD SET IN HANDSBRANE FUNCTION YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A PICTURE OF A BLUEBERRI ER SOME OTHER BERRY BECAUSE OF THESE ANTHOSIONANS I PERSONALLY DON'T SUPPLEMENT ANTHOSIONONS A I DO LIKE BLUEBERRIES I EAT BLUEBERRIES WHEN THEYRE IN SEASON A I LOVE THEM A'M WHAT YOU D CALL A DRIVE BY BLUBERRY EATER LIKE THEIR BLUEBERRIES IN A IN A BOWL ON A TABLE AND I'M WALKING BY I JUST HAVE TO SCOOP THEM UP LIKE SOME SORT OF BEAR OR OTHER ANIMAL IN POPD HEN MY MOUTH SO BLUEBERIES DON'T LAST LONG AROUND ME ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH BERRIES LIKE BLUEBERRIES AND BLACKBERRIES AND SO FORTH IS THAT QUALITY SOURCES OF THEM CAN BE PRETTY EXPENSIVE AND THEN OF COURSE WHEN THEY ARE NOT IN SEASON THEY'RE HARD TO GET AND SO THAT'S WHY SOME PEOPLE WILL SUPPLEMENT WITH THEM SO THAT RANGE OF ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED TO ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILIGRAMS PERDAY SEEMS TO BE ON THE MINMUM THRESHOLD FORD GETTING A COGNIVE EFFECT IN THESE ELDERLY A A PATIENTE I IN THAT CASE THEY WERE PATIENS A GOOD REVIEW ABOUT THE ANTHOSONANS POTENTIALLY CONTRIBUTING TO OFFSETTING COGNAVE DECLINE IN LIKE ALCEIMERS AND ALSO ENHANCING BRAIN FUNCTION IN PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE ALCEIMERS IS A REVIEW BY OFFISAL A FAZ A L THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE ALSO PROVIDE A A LINK TO THAT STUDY IN THE CAPTION WHEN ONE LOOKS ACROSS THE TOTAL BATCH OF STUDIES THAT ARE OUT THERE ON THIS IT APPEARS THAT IF ONE IS GOING TO SUPPLEMENT WITH BLUEBERRY EXTRACT TO GET THE ANTHOSION AN EFFECT ON COGNICTION DOSAGES OF SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIVE AND A HALF FOR ABOUT ELEVEN GRAMS SEEM OPTIMAL WITH THE HIER END CLOSER TO TEN OR ELEVEN GRAMS A BEING MORE BENEFICIAL THE BLUEBERRY EATERS OUT THERE LIKE ME WHO PREFER TO GET THERE ANTHOSIONANS FROM THE ACTUALBERRIES IT APPEARS THAT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SIXTY TO HUNDRED ND TWENTY GRAMS OF FRESH BLUEBERRIES EACH DAY IS THE WAY THAT YOU CAN GET A SUFFICIENT ANTHOSIONINS TO LEAST SHIFT YOUR SYSTEM OR BYAS YOUR BRAIN TOWARDS THESE ENHANCE COGNIVE EFFECTS SO WE'VE GOT EPIA FADIACIDS WE'VE GOT PHOSPHODITAL SERINE WE'VE GOT COLINE WE'VE GOT CREATINE AND WE HAVE THE ANTHOSIONYNS AND THE LAST ITEM THAT I'D LIKE TO PLACE IN THIS LIST OF FOOD DERIVED THINGS THAT CAN ENHANCE BRAIN FUNCTION IS GLUDOMINE GLUDOMINE IS A VERY INTERESTING AMINOACID I'VE TALKED ABOUT GLUDOMINE ON HERE BEFORE THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT SCANT THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE THAT GLUDOMINE CAN ENHANSOME MUNESYSTEM FUNCTION SO PEOPLE WILL SUPPLEMENT WITH GLUDOMINE OR PEOPLE CAN GET GLUDEMINE FROM FOODS FOODS THAT CONTAIN A LOT OF GLUDOMINE ARE THINGS LIKE COTTAGE CHEESE THERE ARE ALSO OTHER SOURCES OF GLUDEMINE GLUDOMINE IS RICH IN PROTING RICH FOODS THINGS LIKE BEEF CHICKEN FISH DAIRY PRODUCTS EGGS BUT ALSO FOR YOU NON O ANIMAL FOOD O CONSUMING PEOPLE OUT THERE OM VEGETABLES INCLUDING BEINES CABBAGE ONCE AGAIN SPENICH PARSILY THINGS OF THAT SORT SO THOSE FOODS CONTAIN GLUDOMINE FOR PEOPLE THAT SUPPLEMENT WITH GLUDOMINE GENERALLY THEY WILL TAKE ANYWHERE FROM A GRAHM AS MUCH AS TEN GRAMS PER DAY WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO DO THAT WELL THERE'S ALSO SOME EVIDENCE STARTING TO EMERGE THAT GLUDOMINE CAN HELP OFFSET SUGAR CRAVINGS AND I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS ON THE PODCAS BEFORE WEARE GOING TO TALK MORE ABOUT THE BASIST FOR THIS A LITTLE BUT LATER BUT IN BRIEF WE ALL HAVE NURONS IN OUR GOT THAT SENSE THE EMINOACID CONTENT THE FAT CONTENT AND THE SUGAR CONTENT OF THE FOODS THAT WE AND SIGNAL IN A SUBCONCIOUS WAY TO OUR BRAIN WHETHER NOT THE FOODS THAT WERE WE ARE EATING CONTAIN CERTAIN LEVELS OF CERTAINOMINOACIDS AND SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE GLUDOMINE SENSING NORANS IN AR GOT THAT ACTUALLY HAVE THEIR LITTLE PROCESSIESE THEIR LITTLE ON EXCELLENTS AND DENDRITIS WE CALL THEM IN THE MUCOSO LINING OF THE GOT THEY'RE NOT JUST SENSE IN GLUDOMINE BUT WHEN THEY DO SNSE GLUDOMINE THEY RESPOND AND THEY SEND SIGNALS TO THE BRAIN THAT ARE SIGNALS OF SATIATION OF SATISFACTION AND IN DOING SO CAN OFFSET SOME OF THE SUGAR CRAVINGS THAT MANY PEOPLE SUFFER FROM NOW HERE WERE TALKING ABOUT GLUDMINE FOR SAKE OF ENHANCING COGNIVE FUNCTION AND THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SHOWN THAT GLUDOMINE SUPPLEMENTATION CAN OFFSET SOME OF THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON COGNITION CAUSED BY ALTITUDE AND OXYGEN DEPROVATION OF OTHER SORTS NOW CAN WI THAT'S KIND OF A STRANGE SUCH AND UNIQUE SITUATION OF YOUR IN O GOING UP TO ALTITUDE SHOULD YOU SUPPLEMENT WITH GLUDOMINE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO THINK MORE CLEARLY WELL IT PEERS THAT THERE'S GOOD RATIONAL FOR DOING THAT BUT THE REASON I BRING THIS UP ASSUMING THAT MOST PEOPLE IN GLUDOMIE ARE NOT GOING UP O TO HIGH ALTITUDES VERY OFTEN IS THAT IT'S BEEN WELL ESTABLISHED THAT APNIA FAILURE TO BREATHE PROPERLY DURING SLEEP CAN CONTRIBUTE TO AGE RELATED AND EVEN NONAGE RELATED COGNIVE DECLINE THERE ARE LOT OF REASONS FOR APNIUS ON RANGING FROM OBICITY TO A OBSTRUCTION OF OF THE AIRWAYS FOR OTHER REASONS A THERE TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF UNDERLYING CAUSES OF APNI AN ITS SOMETHING TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY A MI HARD ATTACKS ALL SORTS OF METABOLIC ISSUES ARE CAUSED BY APNIA APNIAIS A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT DESRUPTS THE DEPTH OF SLEEP AND ITS A SERIOUS HEALTH ISSUE IN GENERAL IN ANY EVENT APNIA IS ASSOCIATED WITH COGNIVE DECLINE AND COGNIVE DISFUNCTION EVEN IN YOUNG PEOPLE AND IT DOES APPEAR THAT GLUDOMINE SUPPLEMENTATION CAN OFFSET SOME OF THE COGNIVE DEPHASITS THAT ARE ASSOCIATE WITH REDUCED OXYGENATION OF THE BRAIN IF YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW APNIA CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT COGNITION THERE IS AN EXCELLENT PAPER THAT WAS PUBLISHED ON THIS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE FIRST AUTHOR SHARMA S AH A R M A IT SHOULD BE EASY TO FINE THE TITLE OF THE PAPER IS OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNIA SEVERITY EFFECTS EMELOID BURDEN INCOGNIVELY NORMAL ELDERLY THIS WAS A LONGITUDINAL STUDY EMELOID BURDEN IS A QORRELET OF ALSHIMERS AND OTHER FORMS OF OF NOURDEGENERATION AND COGNIVE DECLINEN ASSOCIATE WITH MEMORY DEPISITS SO OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP ATH APNIA UEXCUSE ME AS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE FOR WHICH GLUDOMINE APPEARS TO BE ABLE TO OFFSET SOME OF THE NEGATIVE SYMPTEMOLOGY SO HOW IS IT THAT GLUDOMINE EITHER FROM FOOD OR OR THROUGH SUPPLEMENTATION CAN OFFSET SOME OF THESE SO CALLED HYPOXIC EFFECTS CAUSED BY SLEEP APNEA HYPOXIA BEING A LACK OF OXYGEN FOR THE BRAINE THAT RELATE TO COGNIVE DECLINE IT APPEARS TO HAVE THIS POSIVE IMPACT BY WAY OF REDUCING INFLAMMATION SO AN IF YOU WANT A LOOK MORE DEEPLY INTO THE VARIOUS BIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS AND THE SUPPLEMENTATION REGIMES FOR THIS A THE PAPER THAT I THINK IS REALLY SPECTACULAR IS A PAPER LAST AUTHOR A IS QUARESMA QU U A R E S M A THAT Q U A R E S M A IT'S A REVIEW THE POSSIBLE IMPORTANCE OF GLUDOMINE SUPPLEMENTATION TO MOUD AND COGNITION IN HYPOXIA FROM HIGH ALTITUDE AND EVEN THOUGH PAPERIS ABOUT HIGH ALTITUDE INDUCED HYPOXIA IT DOES SEEM TO HAVE DIRECT RELEVANTS TO THE SORTS OF APNIA THAT ARE RELATED TO ALSHIMERS AND OTHER FORMS OF COGNIVE DECLINE NOW I'VE BEEN TAKING GLUDOMINE AS A SUPPLEMENT COCH SINCE I WAS IN COLLEGE MOSTLY BECAUSE I FELT EITHER BY SUPERSTITION OR BY REALITY THAT IT PROTECTED ME FROM A VARIOUS A GLOSING COLDS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT BECAUSE OF THE PROPORTED A IMMUNEINHANCING EFFECTS AGAIN THOSE IMMUNINHANCING EFFECTS HAVE SOME DATA TO SUPPORT THEM NATATON HOWEVER I GOT INTO THE HABIT OF TAKING GLUDOMINE AND BUT NOW THAT HAVE LEARNED THAT GLUDOMINE SEEMS TO ALSO HAVE SOME COGNIVE ENHANCING EFFECTS POSSIBLY IT'S A SUPPLEMENT THAT I CONTINUE TO TAKE I TAKE VERY SMALL AMOUNTS OF IT BUT O MY DU I TAKEIT ON A REGULAR BASIS SO THAT MORE OR LESS COMPLETES THE LIST OF THINGS THAT AT LEAST BY MY READ OF THE LITERATURE OR THINGS HAT ARE SUPPORTED BY AT LEAST THREE AND IN SOME CASES AS MANY AS HUNDREDS OF STUDIES IN VARIOUS POPULATIONS THAT HAVE BEE  EXPLORED IN MOUSE STUDIES OFTEN BUT ALSO IN A NUMBER OF HUMAN STUDIES I WANT TO EMPHASIZE AGAIN THAT ALL OF THE THINGS I LISTED OUT WHETHER OR NOT ITS EPAS WHETHER OR NOT ITS PHOSHITHIDAL SEERING WHETHE R NOT ITS COALING WHETHER OR NOT A IT'S THE VARIOUS COMPOUNDS THAT ARE IN BERRIES ET CETERA ALL OF THOSE CAN BE EXTRACTED FROM FOOD THERE IS NOT ANY LAW THAT SAYS THAT YOU HAVE TO GET THEM FROM SUPPLEMENTATION SUPPLEMENTATION CAN HELP YOU GET TO THE VERY HIGH LEVELS OF THOSE THINGS IF YOU WANT A WORK ON THE HIGHER END IF THAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU OBVIOUSLY CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE TAKING ANYTHING OR REMOVING ANYTHING FROM YOUR DIET OR SUPPLEMENT REGIME BUT IN GENERAL YOU CAN GET THESE THINGS FROM FOODS IS JUST SO HAPPENS THAT FOR SOME OF THESE A COMPOUNDS THE FOODS THAT THEIR CONTAINED IN LIKE FISH ARE NOT FOODS THAT I UM PARTICULARLY ENJOY AND SO I RELY ON UNXCUSE ME I RELY ON SUPPLEMENTS IN ORDER TO GET SUFFICIENT LEVELS FOR ME BUT AGAIN YOU CAN GET THESE LEVELS FROM FOOD AND THE REASON I MADE THIS LIST THE REASON THAT I EMPHASIZE THESE THINGS IN THIS PARTICULAR ORDER IS THAT THEY SUPPORT THE STRUCTURE OF NURANS THEY SUPPORT THE STRUCTURE OF THE OTHER CELLS OF THE BRAIN THAT MAKE UP OUR COGNITION AND THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR OUR FOCUS AND ARE ABILITY TO REMEMBER THINGS IN SO FORTH AND THEY ARE LESS SO IN THE CATEGORY OF SO CALLED MODULATORY EFFECTS THEY WILL ALSO HAVE MODULATORY EFFECTS ON SLEEP ON INFLAMMATION OR REDUCING INFLAMMATION THROUGHOUT THE BODY ON CARTY OVASCULAR FUNCTION ALL OF WHICH I BELIEVE OUR POSITIVE EFFECTS AT LEAST WHAT THE LITERATURE TELLS US IS THAT NONE OF THESE COMPOUNDS ARE HARMING OTHER SYSTEMS OF THE BODY PROVIDED THEY ARE TAKIN AT A REASONABLE LEVELS BUT EVERYTHING IN THIS LIST IS DIRECTED TOWARDS ANSWERING THE QUESTION WHAT CAN I EAT WHAT CAN I INJEST BY WAY OF FOOD AND OR FOOD SUPPLEMENT THAT CAN SUPPORT BRAIN FUNCTION IN THE SHORT TERM AND IN THE LONG TERM SO I HOPE YOU FIND THAT LIST BENEFICIAL FOR YOU EVE NOT FOR USE AT LEAST FOR CONSIDERATION SO NOW HAVING TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE FOODS AND MICRENEUTRIANTS THAT ARE BENEFICIAL TO OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM BRAIN HEALTH I LIKE TO SHIFT GEARS SOMEWHAT AND TALK ABOUT WHY IT IS THAT WE LIKE THE FOODS THAT WE LIKE WE'VE ALL HEARD BEFORE THAT WE ARE HARD WIRED TO PURSUE SUGAR AND TO LIKE FATTY FOODS AND THAT CALORY RICH FOODS ARE ATTRACTIVE TO US FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS YO AS SURVIVING FAMINES AND THINGS OF THAT SORTH AND WHILE THAT IS TRUE THE ACTUAL MECHANISMS THAT UNDERLIE FOOD SEEKING AND FOOD PREFERENCE ARE FAR MORE INTERESTING THAN THAT THEY RE BASICALLY THREE CHANNELS IN OUR BODY AND NERVOUS SYSTEM BY WHICH WE DECIDE WHAT FOODS TO PURSUE HOW MUCH TO EAT AND WHETHER OR NOT WE WILL FIND A PARTICULAR FOOD ATTRACTIVE WHETHER NOT WE WILL WANT TO CONSUME MORE OF IT WHETHER OR NOT WE  WANT TO AVOID IT OR WHETHER R NOT IT'S JUST SORT OF SO SO WHAT I REFER TO AS THE YUM YUCH OR MEH ANALYSIS AND INDEED THAT'S WHAT OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS DOING WITH RESPECT TO FOOD IT'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER NOT YUMG I WANT MORE OF THIS YUCH I WANT TO AVOID THIS OR MEH IT'S SO SO NOW WHILE THAT MAY SEEM LIKE A OVERLY SIMPLIFIED VERSION OF FOOD SEEKING AND FOOD PREFERENCE IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT FAR FROM THE TRUTH IT ACTUALLY CORRECTLY CAPTURES MUCH OF THE BIOLOGY OF FOOD PREFERENCE SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THESE THREE CHANNELS FOR FOOD PREFERENCE ARE THE FIRST ONE IS AN OBVIOUS ONE IT'S TASTE ON THE MOUTH IT IS THE SENSATION THAT WE HAVE OF THE FOODS THAT WE EAT WHILE WE'RE CHEWING THEM AND THOSE SENSATIONS WHICH ARE LITERALLY JUST SOMATICENSORY TOUCH SENSATIONS YOU KNOW THE THE A PALADABILITY OF FOOD AS IT RELATES TO THE CONSISTENCY OF FOOD THAT'S IMPORTANT AND AS YOU'VE ALL HEARD BEFORE WE HAVE CENSORS ON OUR TONGUE AND ELSEWHERE IN OUR MOUTH THAT DETECT THE VARIOUS CHEMICALS CONTAINED WITHIN FOOD AND LEAD TO THE SENSES OF TASTE WHICH WE CALL BITTER SWEET UMAMI SALTY INSOUR NOW MOST OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE SENSE OF BITTERNESS THAT COMES FROME SOMETHING LIKE A RAW RADISH SWEET WHICH COMES OBVIOUSLY FROM SUGARS OF DIFFERENT KINDS FOR TOSGLUCOS ET CETERA SALTY SALTY AND SOUR THINK LEMON OR LEMON JUCE FOR INSTANCE AND THEN I MENTION UMAMI THE UMAMI RECEPTOR IS A RECEPTER THAT RESPONDS TO THE SAVORY TASTE OF THINGS SO THAT'S AH WHAT YOU MIGHT FIND IN A REALLY WONDERFULLY RICH TOMATO SAUCE FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT EAT MEAT AND LIKE MEAT A A REALLY WELL COOKED NOT SOLY WELL DONE BUT PROPERLY COOKED I SHOULD SAY STAKE AH IF THAT'S YOUR THING AND UMAMI IS PRESENT IN BOTH PLANT AND ANIMAL FOODS AND GIVES US THAT SENSATION OF SAVORINESS IT ALMOST HAS A KIND OF LITTLE BIT OF ABRINY TASTE TO IT OR BRAZED TASTE TO IT AND INDEED BRAZING OF MEATS AND BRAZING OF VEGETABLES IS DONE SPECIFICALLY TO ACTIVATE THAT UMAMI RECEPTOR SO WE HAVE THOSE FIVE BASIC TASTES THOSE ARE CHEMICAL SENSORS ON THE TONGUE THAT WHAT WE CALL TRANSDEUCE THOSE CHEMICALS THOSE CHEMICALS LITERALLY INFOOD BIND TO THOSE RECEPTORS AND IT IS TRANSDEUCED MEANING THE BINDING OF THOSE CHEMICALS TO THE RECEPTORS IS CONVERTED INTO AN ELECTRICAL SIGNAL THAT TRAVELS IN FROM THE TONGUE ALONG WHAT'S CALLED THE GUSTATORY NERVE THE GUSTATORY NERVE THEN SYNAPSES MEAN MEANING IT MAKES CONNECTIONS IN OUR BRAINSTEM IN THE SO CALL NUCLIOUS OF THE SOLITARY TRACT THEIR OTHER NEUCLIEE BACK THEIR NUCLARGUS AGGREGATES OF NURANS AND THEN IT SENDS INFORMATION UP TO THE SO CALLED INSULAR QUARTECS TO THE INSULA I WANT A HIGHLIKE THE INSULA THIS EPISODE BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO RETURN TO THE INSULA AGAIN AND AGAIN IN THIS EPISODE AND LATER THE INSULAR QUARTEX IS A INCREDIBLE STRUCTURE THAT WE ALL HAVE THAT MAINLY IS CONCERNED WITH SO CALLED INTERROCEPTION OR OUR PERCEPTION OF WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OUR BODY SO TO BE THE AMOUNT OF PRESSURE IN OUR GOT BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH FOOD WE'VE EATEN IT COULD BE A THE ACIDITY OF OUR GOT IF WE'RE HAVING A LOBIT OF INDIGESTION FOR INSTANCE IT CAN ALSO BE THE CASE THAT NURONS WITHIN THE INSULA ORE PAYING ATTENTION TO HOW STRESTE YOU ARE OR HOW ALERT YOU ARE OR HOW TIRED YOU ARE SO IT'S REALLY AN INWARD FOCUSING STRUCTURE IT FOCUSES ON HOW WE FEEL INTERNALLY AND NOT SURPRISINGLY THE TASTE SYSTEM SENS INFORMATION UP TO THE INSULAR QUARTEX TO GIVE US A SENSE LITERALLY OF WHAT WE'VE INGESTED WHETHER OR NOT WHAT WERE TASTING TASTES GOOD OR NOT WE WERE TURNED TO INSULAR QUARTEXS IN A FEW MOMENTS A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE NURONS IN THE AREAS OF THE QUARTEX YOUR QUARTEXS IN MIND THAT RESPOND TO PARTICULAR TASTES OR PROVIDING AN INTERNAL REPRESENTATION OF AN EXTERNAL SENSE WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT I DON'T WANT TO BE AT ALL ABSTRACT WE TAKE THESE FOODS WE BREAK THEM DOWN IN OUR MOUTH BY CHEWING THEM OR SUCKING ON THEM WHATEVER IT IS THA FOOD HAPPENS TO BE THOSE CHEMICALS BIND TO THOSE RECEPTORS AND ELECTRICAL SIGNALS ARE SENT INTO THE BRAIN BUT THEY ARE JUST ELECTRICAL SIGNALS JUST LIKE NOTES BEING PLAYED ON THE KEYS OF A PIANO THERE'S NO UNIQUE SIGNATURE FOR SALTY OR SWEET IT IS THE RELATIVE ACTIVATION OF ONE SET OF NURANS THAT WAS ACTIVATED BY SWEET OR ANOTHER SET OF NURANS THAT WAS ACTIVATED BY UMAMI IT'S THAT RELATIVE ACTIVATION TRAVELING INTO THE BRAIN IN ESSENTIALLY THE SAME FORM THE SAME ELECTRICAL SIGNALS THIS IS REALLY INCREDIBLE RIGHT ELECTRICAL SIGNALS ARE SENT IN THE BRAIN AND YOU SAY AHA THAT SWEET AND I WANT MORE OF IT OR THAT'S BITTER I WANT LESS OF IT OR THAT'S UMAMMI FLAVORED AND I REALLY REALLY LIKE THAT REALLY LIKE SAVORY FOODS AS I HAPPEN TO THAT SHOULD IMMEDIATELY STRIKE YOU AS INCREDIBLE BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT YOUR REPRESENTATION OF WHAT YOU WANT MORE OF OR LESS OF IS ELECTRICAL IN NATURE AND TO REALLY TAMP THIS ISSUE DOWN STUDIES THAT WERE DONE BY CHARLES ZUCKER ZU K E ARE IS A ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL NOR SCIENTIST AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IN NEW YORK STUDIES DONE BY THE SUCKER LAB HAVE SHOWN THAT FIRST OF ALL THEY COULD IDENTIFY THE NURANS IN THE QUARTEX DEEP IN THE BRAIN THAT RESPOND TO A SWEET TASTE OR TO A BITTER TASTE IT TURNS OUT THEY ARE NON OVERLAPPING POPULATIONS OF NURANS AND THEN USING SOME MELECULAR TRICKS THEY WERE ABLE TO EITHER SILENCE OR ACTIVATE THE NURANS THAT FOR INSTANCE RESPOND TO SWEET WHEN THEY DO THIS THEY SEE INCREDIBLE CONSEQUENCES ON PERCEPTION THAT INDEED OCCUR IN YOUR BRAIN AND MY BRAIN AS WELL ALL THE TIME WITHOUT THESE KIND OF MANIPULATIONS HERE'S THE EXPERIMENT THEY HAVE A SUBJECT DRINK WATER THAT CONTAIN SUGAR OR DRINK WATER THAT CONTAINS A SALTY SUBSTANCE OR DRINK WATER THAT CONTAINS A BITTER SUBSTANCE FOR INSTANCE KIAM SORT OF PARAPHRASING A LARGE AMOUNT OF WORK THEY IDENTIFY THE NURONS THAT RESPOND TO SWEET TASTES THEY SEE AS MANY RESEARCHES HAVE SEEN THAT SUBJECTS PREFER SWEET TASTE TO OTHER TASTES AND CERTAINLY SWEET TASTE TO BITTER OR SWEET TASTE TO NOTHING SO TO PLAIN WATER AND THEN THEY GO IN AND THEY ARE ABLE TO SELECTIVELY SILENCE THE NURONS THAT REPRESENT SWEET AND WHEN THEY DO THAT THEY ELIMINATE THE PREFERENCE FOR THAT SWEET TASTE NOW THAT MIGHT SEEM OBVIOUS THE NURANS RESPOND TO SWEET YOU SILENCEOS NURONS THEY NO LONGER SEEK OUT SWEET BUT THAT SHOULD STRIKE YOU ALSO AS INCREDIBLE BECAUSE THEYARE NOT ACTUALLY CHANGING WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE TONGUE OR IN THE DEEPER LAYERS OF THE BRAIN CONVERSELY THEY CAN HAVE SUBJECTS DRINK BITTER WATER OR PLAIN WATER WHILE ACTIVATING SELECTIVELY ACTIVATING THE NURONS THAT RESPOND TO SWEET AND WHAT THEY FIND IS THAT THAN SUBJECTS WILL ACTIVELY PREFER BITTER OR PLAIN WATER TO ACTUAL PREFERENCE IS SUCH AS SWEET SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT YOUR PERCEPTION OF WHAT YOU LIKE IS A CENTUAL MEANING WITH IT DEEP WITHIN THE BRAIN PHENOMENON IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW THINGS TASTE ON YOUR MOUTH NOW OF COURSE UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS WHERE THEIRE AREN'T THESE EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATIONS BEING DONE THOSE THINGS ARE POSITIVELY CORRELATED SWEET TASTES TRIGGER THE ACTIVATION OF SWEET NURANS FOR INSTANCE NURANS IN THE MOUTH THAT RESPOND TO UMAMI TRIGGER THE ACTIVATION OF NRONS IN THE BRAIN THAT RESPOND TO UMAMMI AND SO FORTH SO THEYRE CORRELATED IN A WAY THAT MAKES YOU SEEK OUT THE THINGS THAT YOU LIKE AND AVOID THE THINGS THAT YOU DON'T LIKE BUT AS WILL SEE IN A FEW MINUTES TURNS OUT THAT THAT IS NOT A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP THAT IS HARD WIRED YOU CAN ACTUALLY UNCOUPLE THE PREFERENCE FOR PARTICULAR TASTE WITH THE REWARD SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN IN A WAY THAT FOR INSTANCE WOULD ALLOW YOU TO EAT AH OR I SHOULD USE MYSELF AS ENXAMLICS THA ON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE FISH I'AVE HAD A FEW YOU KNOW MEALS THAT INCLUDE A FISH THAT WERE PRETTY GOOD BUT NONE OF THEM WERE MEMORABLE IN THE CON OF POSITIVE WAY LIKE SOME OTHER EVENTS IN MY LIFE REMEMORABLE BUT BY WAY OF THESE CIRCUITRIES IND THE WAY THEY LINK UP WITH ONE ANOTHER IT'S ACTUALLY POSSIBLE TO REWIRE ONE SENSE OF TASTE AND PREFERENCE FOR PARTICULAR FOODS IF THIS IS SEEMING AT ALL VAGUE TO YOU JUST HANGIN WITH ME A LITTLE BIT LONGER BECAUSE I WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH THE INFORMATION TOOLS AND RESOURCES WITH WHICH TO NAVIGATE THIS PROCESS BUT THE MOST IT IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT LIKE WITH OUR HEARING LIKE WITH VISION LIKE WITH SMELL TASTE IS IN INTERNAL REPRESENTATION THAT HAS PARTICULAR GOALS FOR YOU YOUR SENSE OF WHAT TASTE GOOD IS RELATED TO PARTICULAR THINGS THAT ARE OCURRING IN YOUR BRAIN AN BODY AND THAT ARE LIKELY TO GIVE YOUR BRAIN AN BODY THE THINGS THAT IT NEEDS IT IS NOT SIMPLY A MATTER OF WHAT YOU QUOTE IN QUO LIKE OR WHAT TASTE GOOD OR WHAT DOESN'T TASTE GOOD LET ME GIVE YOU A RELATIVELY SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF HOW YOUR BODY AND YOUR BRAIN ARE ACTING IN A CORDINATED WAY TO MAKE YOU PREFER CERTAIN FOODS AND INDEED TO PURSUE CERTAIN FOODS MORE SI JUST MENTION YOU HAVE NURONS ON YOUR TONGUE THAT RESPOND TO DIFFERENT TASTE BUT OF COURSE YOUR DIGESTIVE TRACK IS 'T JUST YOUR TONGUE ITS ALSO YOUR THROAT GOE S ALL THE WAY DOWN TO YOUR STOMAC AND OF COURSE YOUR INTESTINS IT IS ALONG TUBE OF DIGESTION ALL ALONG THAT TUBE THERE ARE NURONS SOME OF THE NURONS ARE RESPONDING TO THE MECHANICAL SIZE OF WHATEVER PORTION THE DIGESTIVE TRACTOV HAPPENS TO BE SO FOR INSTANCE HOW DISTENDED OR EMPTY OR FULL RATHER DOESN'T HAVE TO BE DESCENDED HOW O DPENS HOW MUCH YOU ATE BUT HOW FULL OR EMPTY YOUR GUT HAPPENS TO BE WHETHER NOT SOMETHING YOU JUST ATE IS TEMPERATUR HOT YOU KNOW IS HOT IN THE SENSE OF HOT TO THE TOUCH OR WHETHER NOT ITS SPICY HOT WHETHER NOT ITS SOOTHING WHETHER NOT ITS AND OF HARD TO SWALLOW THIS KIND OF THING SWE OF NURONS ALL LONG YOUR GUT THAT ARE RESPONDING TO THE MECHANICS RELATED TO FOOD IN DIGESTION AND THAT ARE RELATED TO THE CHEMISTRY OF FOOD AN DIGESTION THERE'S A POPULATION OF NURONS NERVE CELLS IN YOUR GUT THAT ARE EXQUISITELY TUNED TO THE CHEMISTRY OF WHATEVER IT IS IN YOUR GUT AND THESE ARE NURONS CALLED NUROPOD CELLS THEY WERE DISCOVERED MANY MANY YEARS AGO BUT REALLY DEFINED WITH AND CLASSIFIED WITH MODERN TOOLS BY DIEGOBORES IHOPE I'M PRONOUNCING YOUR NAME CORRECTLY DIEGO WE'VE SPOKEN MANY TIMES BUT I CAN'T EVER SEEM TO QUITE CAPTURE THE PROPER PRONUNCIATION JUST RIGHT BUT DIEGOBORES AT DUKE UNIVERSITY WHO DISCOVERED THAT THESE CELLS RESIDE WITHIN THE GUT AND PLACE LITTLE PROCESSES THEIR LITTLE AXONS AND DENDRITS WITHIN THE MUCOSA LINING OF THE GUT AND THERE THEY ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO MEANING THEY RESPOND TO A MINOACIDS SUGARS AND FATIACIDS SO AS YOUR FOOD IS DIGESTED AS FOOD LANDS WITHIN YOUR GUT NURONS THEY ARE ARE SENSING WHAT TYPES OF FOODS ARE AVAILABLE AND WHAT TYPES OF THINGS ARE MAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH THE GUT ENVIRONMENT NOW THOSE NURONS AREN'T ACTUALLY TAKING THOSE FOODS IN DOING MUCH WITH THEM WHAT THEYRE DOING IS THER THEIRE ESSENTIALLY A SURVEYING WHAT QUALITIES OF FOOD ARE THERE AND THESE PARTICULAR NURONS THAT IEGO AND HIS GROUP DISCOVERED SEND ELECTRICAL SIGNALS UP INTO THE BRAIN THROUGH A LITTLE PASSAGE THAT WE CALL THE NODO'S GANGLION THAT NODOS GANGLE IS A A CLUSTER OF NURONS THAT THEN GOFIR SEND A THEIR OWN PROCESS INTO THE BRAIN AND TRIGGER THE RELEASE OF DOPAMINE WHICH IS A MOLECULE THAT INSPIRES MOTIVATION REWARD AND MORE SEEKING FOR WHATEVER IT IS LED TO THEIR ACTIVATION THESE ARE SUPERINTERESTING NURONS BECAUSE WHAT THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY DOING IS THEY ARE PROVIDING A SUBCONSCIOUS SIGNAL ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD THAT YOURE EATING WHAT IT CONTAINS AND THEN TRIGGERING THE RELEASE OF A MOLECULE WITHIN YOUR BRAIN DOPOMINE THAT LEADS YOU TO GO SEEK MORE OF THOSE FOODS NOW THIS HAS PROFOUND IMPACT ON A NUMBER OF THINGS FIRST OF ALL THERE'S THE CONSIDERATION OF SO CLLED HIDDEN SUGARS DOCTOR ROBERT LUSTIG WHOS A PEDIATRIC UNDER CRONOLOGISTS TAT UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO HAS BEEN AMONG THE MOST PROMINENT RESEARCHES TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE THESE SO CALLED HIDDEN SUGARS IN FOODS NOW THESE ARE NOT YOUS SUGARS THAT THEY SNEAK IN JUST TO BE SNEAKY THESE ARE SUGARS THAT ARE LITERALLY SNUCKYIN IN A WAY THAT YOU CAN'T TASTE THEM THAT'S WHY THEY ARE CALLED HIDDEN SUGARS NOT THAT THEY JUST PUT THEM IN THERE FOR FUN THESE ARE SUGARS THAT ARE PLACED INTO PROCESS FOODS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO TRIGGER ACTIVATION OF THESE MECHANISMS TO LEADS YOU TO WANT TO EAT MORE OF THESE FOODS BUT NOT BECAUSE THEY NECESSARILY TASTE SWEET OR DELICIOUS BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE ACTIVATING THE SUBCONSCIOUS MECHANISMS THAT ARE DRIVING YOU TO PURSUE MORE OF THESE FOODS SOMETHING A VERY DIABOLICAL STRATEGY AND INDEED IT IS SOMEWHAT OF A DIABOLICAL STRATEGY HOWEVER THESE NURONS ARE ALSO INVOLVED INSIGNALLING TO YOUR BRAIN WHEN FOR INSTANCE YOU ARE EATING OF FOOD THAT IS RICH IN A MAGATHREE FATIACIDS THE PADIASIS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER SO WHY IS IT THAT YOU DON'T CRAVE SALMON WISE AT THAT I DON'T SIT AROUND DAY DREAMING ABOUT MACREL WELL BECAUSE THEREIS ALSO THE INFLUENCE OF THE ACTUAL TASTE ON THE MOUTH UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS AT'S A COMMINATION OF THE TASTE OF THE THING ON THE MOUTH PLUSS THIS SUBCONSCIOUS SIGNALING FROM THE GUT AND WHILE THIS IS INTO DISCUSSION ABOUT GOT MICROBION I SHOULD JUST MENTION THAT IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT HAVING A HEALTHY GOT MICROBION ALLOWS THESE NURONS TO FUNCTION IN A WAY THAT SERVES OUR SEEKING OF HEALTHY FOODS IN POSITIVE WAYS AND WITHOUT GETTIG INTO A LOT OF DETAIL ABOUT THIS THE BEST WAY TO INSURE A HEALTHY GOT MICROBAUM THAT I AM AWARE OF IS NOT NECESSARILY TO TAKE SUPPLEMENTAL PREBIOTICS ARE PROBIOTICS THEY ARE ACTUALLY SOME REASONS WHY YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO DO THAT BUT RATHER TO INJEST TWO TOFOUR SERVINGS OF FERMENTED FOODS THAT ARE LOW IN SUGAR EACH DAY THERE IS A RECENT STUDY PUBLISHIN CELLS SHOWING HAT THE INGESTION OF FERMENTED FOODS TWO TO FOURE SERVINGS EACH DAY CAN ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF THE MUCOSO LINING OF THE GOT THAT ALLOW CERTAIN GOT MICROBIODA TO FLOURISH AND THE GOT MICROBIOTA THAT ARE NOT GOOD FOR UST TO NOT FLOURISH CAUSE THAT'S THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY SETTLE DOWN INTO THIS IS WORK THAT WAS CARRIED OUT BY MY COLLEGUES A JUST IN SONIMBERG IS IN THE LABORATORY UPSTAIRS FOR ME AS WELL AS CRIS GARDENER AND OTHERS AT STAMFORD THEYE ARE CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY RESEARCHERS EXPLORING THIS BUT IT DOES APPEAR THAT TWO TO FOUR SERVINGS OF FERMENTED FOODS EACH DAYS OF THESE WOULD BE THINGS LIKE NOTO SOUR CROUT A LOW SUGAR FERMENTED FOODS IS GREAT FOR THE GOT MICROBIOM AND SEPARATE STUDIES NOT THEIRE STUDY BUT SEPARATE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THAT CORRECT GMICROBIUM CONDITIONS ALLOW THESE NURONS THAT SIGNAL TO THE BRAIN TO SIGNAL THE RIGHT AT THE RIGHT TIMES AND IN THE RIGHT WAYS TO PROMOTE HEALTHY FOOD SEEKING MANY PEOPLE OPT TO SUPPLEMENT WITH CAPSUL FORM PROBIOTICS THERE ARE SOME DATA THAT SUGGEST THAT MAY BE THOSE DON'T CONTAIN THE CORRECT PREBOTICS AND PROBIOTICS FOR SETTING THE CORRECT GOT MICROBIOTA CONDITIONS AT'S I LOW BIT OF A CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE NONE THE LESS GETTING PROBIOTICS FROM FERMENTED FOODS IS PROBABLY THE SIMPLEST AND MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY IT'S ALSO THE WAY AND THAT WE EVOLVED TO DO THAT OVER YOU KNOW MANY AT LEAST HUNDREDS AND PROBABLY THOUSANDS OR EVEN TENDS TOIR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INJESTING FORMENTED FOODS NOT JUST FOR THEIR TASTE BUT FOR THEIR HEALTH BENEFITS AS WELL SO NOW I'VE MENTION TWO OF THE THREE MECHANISMS BY WHICH WE PREFER CERTAIN FOODS ONE IS FROM THE ACTUAL TASTE THAT WERE FAMILIAR WITH THE TASTE ON HER TONGUE AND IN HER MOUTH AND THE SENSATIONS THAT MAKE US GO MUN OR E OR E THE YOUNG YOUNC ME RESPONSES AS I REFERED TO THEM EARLIER AND THEN THERE'S THIS SUBCONSCIOUS SIGNALLING COMING FROM THE GT THAT'S REALLY BASED ON THE NEUTREENT CONTENT TOF THE FOODS THERE'S A THIRD PATHWAY WHICH IS THE LEARNED ASSOCIATION OF A PARTICULAR TASTE WITH THE PARTICULAR QUALITY OR VALUE THAT AF FOOD HAS AND THIS IS WHERE THINGS GET REALLY INTERESTING AND WHERE THERE'S ACTUALLY A LEVERAGE POINT FOR YOU TO REWIRE WHAT IT IS THAT YOU FIND TASTY AND THAT YOU WANT TO SEEK MORE OF THE WORK I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT NEXT HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT IN MALSEMODELS AND HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT IN PARALLEL EXPERIMENTS IN HUMANS THIS IS LARGELY NOT EXCLUSIVELY BUT LARGELY THE WORK OF IVAN DE ARUHO AND DAN A SMALL IVAN DERUHO IS AT MOUNTSINA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND DANA SMALL IS AT YALE AND THEY AND OTHERS IN THEIR FIELD HAVE DONE INCREDIBLE EXPERIMENTS EXPLORING HOW TASTE AND FOOD VALUE THE NUTRITIONAL VALUE OF FOOD AND THE IMPACT OF THAT FOOD ON METABOLISM IN THE BRAIN DRIVES OUR FOOD CHOICES AND ALLOWS US TO CHANGE OUR FOOD CHOICES FOR THE BETTER THEIR GROUPS HAVE DONE SOME REALLY AMAZING STUDIES INVOLVING INGESTION OF A PARTICULAR SUBSTANCE THAT EITHER CONTAINS SUGAR AND THEREBY CAN ELEVATE GLUCOS BLOOD SUGAR OR NOT AND VARYING MEANING CHANGING THE TASTE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT INGESTION OF SUGAR SO LETME JUST GIVE YOU A SIMPLE EXAMPLE WHERE THEY HAVE SUBJECTS THESE CON BE MICE OR THESE CO BE HUMANS CASE THEY'VE DONE BOTH SETS OF STUDIES DRINK SWEET WATER AS AN ALTERNATIVE OR CHOICE TO NON SWEETEN WATER OR BITTER WATER OR SOME OTHER FLAVOR WHAT THEY FIND IS THAT MICE IN HUMANS WILL PREFER TO CONSUME THE SWEET BEVERAGE NOW IT'S NOT ALWAYS SWEET WATER MICE LIKE SWEET WATER BUT HUMANS WILL LET WILL PREFER FOR INSTANCE A MILK SHAKE A FATTY SWEET COM DRINK THO CONSUE MORE OF THAT AND NOT SURPRISINGLY DOPOMINE LEVELS IN THE BRAIN INCREASE IN RESPONSE TO THAT SO THE TASTE AND THE NEUTRIANT CONTENT OF WHAT IT IS THAT THEIR INGESTING ARE ALINED THEY ARE MATCHED THEY'VE ALSO DONE EXPERIMENTS WHERE THEY HAVE NO TASTE BUT SUBJECTS ARE BEING INFUSED WITH SUGAR DIRECTLY INTO THE GUT AND NOT SURPRISINGLY BASED ON EVERYTHING IHAVE TOLD YOU UP UNTIL NOW SUBJECTS WILL PURSUE MORE OF THAT THING RELATIVE TO SOME OTHER TASTE EITHER NEUTRAL OR NEGATIVE TASTE BECAUSE THAT SUGAR IN THE GUT IS TRIGGERING THE ACTIVATION OF THE NURANS I MENTIONED EARLIER WHICH IS SIGNALLING TO THE BRAIN TO PURSUE MORE OF THAT THING SO THIS TELLS US SOMETHING IMPORTANT IT TELLS US THAT WE ARE DRIVEN MEANING WE HAVE MECHANISMS IN OUR BRAIN THAT MAKE US MOTIVATED TO PURSUE MORE OF WHAT BRINGS BOTH A TASTE OF SWEETNESS BUT ALSO THAT BRINGS ACTUAL CHANGES IN BLOOD GLUCO LEVELS UP OCAS SO WE ARE MOTIVATED TO EAT SWEET THINGS NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY TASTE GOOD BUT BECAUSE THEY CHANGE OUR BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL THEY INCREASE OUR BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT MEADN BE THE CASE IT COULD HAVE BEEN THAT WE WERE JUST WIRED TO PURSUE THINGS THAT TASTE GOOD BUT WHAT THIS TELLS US IS THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY WIRED TO PURSUE THINGS THAT INCREASE OUR BLOOD GLUCOS SO MUCH SO THAT WHEND THE SMALL LAB ITS NOT A SMALL ABSETY A BIG LAB BUT WHEN DAIN A SMALL SLAB AND OR IVAN DEARUCO'S LAB HAVE DONE EXPERIMENTS WHERE THEY USE A COMPOUND CALLED TO DEOXY GLUCOS THIS IS A COMPOUND THAT CAN PREVENT GLUCOS FROM BEING METABOLIZED BY NURON SO BLOOD GLUCOS IS GOING UP BUT NURANS CAN'T USE IT WHAT THEY FIND IS THAT THE REENFORCING OR THE REWARDING PROPERTIES OF OF FOOD OR TASTE ARE ELIMINATED P UT SIMPLY IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR A FOOD TO TASTE GOOD CONSCIOUSLY IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR A FOOD TO INCREASE BLOOD SUGAR YOU NEED BLOOD SUGAR TO GO UP AND THAT BLOOD SUGAR GLUCCOS HAS TO BE UTILIZED BY THE NURONS EVEN IF IT'S NOT ASSOCIATED WITH A GOOD TASTE AND TO MAKE IT EVEN SIMPLER IF THIS ISN'T SINKING IN THIS SHOULD MAKE IT VERY CLEAR WHAT YOUR BRAIN MEANING WHAT YOU ARE SEEKING WHEN YOU EAT IS NOT TASTE IS NOT DOPAMINE IS NOT EVEN ARISE IN BLOOD GLUCOSE WHAT YOUR SEEKING EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T REALIZE IT BECAUSE ITS SUBCONSCIOUS IS YOU ARE SEEKING THINGS THAT ALLOW YOUR NURONS TO BE METABOLICALLY ACTIVE AND THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING WHY YOU EAT WHY YOU EAT PARTICULAR FOODS AND HOW YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO THOSE FOODS NOW EARLIER I REFERRED TO CIRCUITS THAT ARE WIRED FOR A PARTICULAR OUTCOME AND IN BIOLOGY AND IN PARTICULAR NURROSCIENCE WE REFER TO THINGS THAT ARE EITHER HARD WIRED MEANING IMMUTABLE AND UNCHANGEABLE OR SOFT WIRED A GOOD EXAMPLE OF SOFT WIRING WOULD BE THE AREAS OF YOUR BRAIN THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SPEECH AND LANGUAGE AR ALWAYS MORE OR LESS IN THE SAME PLACE IN YOUR BRAIN AND EVERY ONE ELSE IS BRAIN HOWEVER THEY ARE NOT HARD WIRED TO SPEAK FRENCS OR TO SPEEK ENGLISH OR TO SPEAK CHINESE OR TO SPEAK GERMAN BECAUSE DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE BORN IN THE PARENTS THAT YOU'RE BORN TO YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK WANER MAY BE EVEN MORE LANGUAGES THE TASTE SYSTEM AND THIS GENERAL SYSTEM OF SEEKING PARTICULAR FOODS SIMILARLY IS HARD WIRED TO OBTAIN CERTAIN TYPES OF NEUTRIANCE IT TENDS TO LIKE SWEET THINGS MOST CHILDREN NATURALLY LIKE SWEET THINGS SOME MORE THAN OTHERS BUT NATURALLY MOST PEOPLE FROM CHILDHOOD ONWARD DON'T PARTICULARLY CRAYE VERY BITTER SUBSTANCES MAY BE MILDLY BITTER BUT NOT VERY BITTER SO THERE'S SOME HARD WIRING OF PREFERENCE BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME SOFT WIRING IN THE SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS IT TO CHANGE THE GROUPS I MENTION EARLIER HAVE DONE SOME REALLY BEAUTIFUL EXPERIMENTS LOOKING AT HOW ARDIFICIAL SWEETENERS INTERACT WITH THE ACTUAL SWEET SENSING SYSTEM AND THIS GETS RIGHT DOWN TO A NUMBER OF ISSUES FIRST OF ALL IT GETS TO THE ISSUE OF HOW WE CAN REWIRE OUR TASTE SYSTEM IN WAYS THAT SERVE US FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE SECOND OF ALL IT GETS RIGHT DOWN TO THE ISSUE OF WHEATHER NOT ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS ARE GOOD FOR US AR BAD FOR US AND INDEED AS OF JUST THIS LAST YEAR WE NOW ENANSWER TO THAT QUESTION AND TURNS OUT IT DEPENDS AND I WILL TELL YOU IN A FEW MINUTES WHEN IT IS OKE TO INJEST ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS AND WHEN IT IS VERY DETRIMENTAL TO INGST ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS OF ANY KIND REGARDLESS I'M NOT TA NAME OFF BRANNAMES BUT THEIRE DIFFERENT FORMS OF THESE ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS NOWADAYS AND THERE AR VARIOUS FORMS OF NON COLORIC PLANTBASE SWEETENERS FOR WHICH THE SAME INFORMATION THAN AM ABOUT TO TELL YOU APPLIES ET SO THE EXPERIMENTS THAT WERE DONE BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATE THAT YOU ILL SEEK OUT PARTICULAR FOODS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY TASTE BECAUSE OF THEIR IMPACT ON BLOOD GLUCOS LEVELS BUT ALSO ON THEIR IMPACT ON THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM EVEN IF YOUR BLOOD LUCOS LEVELS DON'T CHANGE SO HERE'S THE EXPERIMENT ONE GROUP OF SUBJECTS IS GIVEN A SWEET TASTE OF A SUBSTANCE THAT ALSO RAISES BLOOD GLUCOS LEVELS BLOOD SUGAR AND DOPOMINE GOES UP NOT SURPRISINGLY SECOND CONDITION SEPARATE SUBJECTS CONSUME AN ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER OR A NON CLORIC SWEETENER IT IS NOT PREFERRED MUCH OVER OTHER SUBSTANCES BUT IT IS SWEET SO ITS PREFERRED SOMEWHAT AND IT DOES NOT CAUSE IN INCREASE IN BLOOD LUCOS LEVELS AND NOT SURPRISINGLY DOPOMINE LEVELS DON'T GO UP SO INDITIALLY WE DON'T TEND TO LIKE ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS THAT MUCH THAT'S THE SIMPLE WAY OF PUTTING IT HOWEVER IF SUBJECTS CONTINUE TO INJEST ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS EVEN THOUGH THE'S NO INCREASE IN BLOOD LUCOS LEVEL AND THEREFORE NO INCREASE IN BRAIN METABOLISM DOPOMIN LEVELS EVENTUALLY START TO RISE AND WHEN THOSE DOPOMING LEVELS EVENTUALLY START TO RISE YOU'VE ESSENTIALLY CONDITIONED OR REENFORCED THAT ARTIFICIAL OR NONCLORIC SWEETENER AND THEN SUBJECTS START TO CONSUME MORE OF IT AND THE ACTUALLY GET ADOPOMINE INCREASE FROM IT SO THAT'S INTERESTING IT SAYS THAT CONSUMING MORE OF THESE ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS OR CONSUMING THEM FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME CAN STARTS A TAPPINTO THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM AND LEAD US TO SEEK OUT OR CONSUME MORE OF THESE ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS MANY PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THIS BECAUSE WE TEND TO A OR I SHOULD SAY PEOPLE REPORT THAT WHEN THEY INJEST THESE ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS AT FIRST THEY DON'T TASTE VERY GOOD BUT THEN OVER TIME THEY SEEM KIND OF TOLERABLE AND THEN MAY BE EVEN PLEASUREFORE AND THAN SOME PEOPLE FEEL QUOTUNCUO ADDICTED TO VARIOUS DIET SODAS AND THINKS OF THAT SORT NOW THE'S ANOTHER CONDITION THAT SBEEN EXPLORED AND THAT'S THE REALLY INTERESTING CONDITION AND IT'S THE CONDITION WHERE AN ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER IS PARED WITH A SUBSTANCE THAT CAN INCREASE BLOOD SUGAR BUT NOT BECAUSE IT TASTE SUGARY LIKE A NORMAL SWEET SUBSTANCE SO NOW THEREIS AN ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER THAT'S COUPLED WITH AN ACTUAL INCREASE IN BLOOD GLUCOS THEN NATURAL WORLD SENARIO WHERE THIS WOULD HAPPEN WOULD BE DRINKING A DIET SODA WHICH CONTAINS NO CALORIES AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT INCREASE BLOOD GLUCOS BUT IS SWEET WITH A FOOD THAT INCREASES BLOOD GLUCOS AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS WHAT YOUR ESSENTIALLY DOING IS TAPPING INTO THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM THIS NON CLORIC SWEETEN SWEET TASTE IS PARED WITH IT AND THERE'S AN INCREASE IN IN NERON METABOLISM SO YOU HAVE ALL OF THE COMPONENTS FOR REENFORCEMENT AND AS A CONSEQUENCE YOU GET IN A SORT OF PAVLOVIAN CONDITI NING WAY A SITUATION WHERE LATER WHEN YOU INJEST THAT ARTIFICIAL SWEETNER YOU ACTUALLY GET NOT ONLY THE INCREASE IN DOPOMINE BUT YOU GET ALTERATIONS IN BLOOD SUGAR MANAGEMENT NOW BLOOD SUGAR CANNOT GO UP IF YOU DON'T INJEST SOMETHING THAT MAKES BLOOD SUGAR GO UP SO IT'S NOT AS IF YOU INJEST ARTIFICIAL SWEETNER WITH SOME FOOD THAT CONTAINS CALORIES ARE SUGAR AND THEN LATER YOU REMOVE THE FOOD AND YOU JUST DRINK THE SODA AND YOUR BLOOD GLUCOS GOES UP RATHER IT'S A MUCH WORSE SITUATION IF YOU I'LL MAKE THIS IN THE NATURAL WORLD CONTACT IF YOU INJEST AN ARTIFICIAL SWEETNER SAY DRINK DIETSOTA WHILE CONSUMING FOODS THAT INCREASE BLOOD GLUCOS THEN LATER EVEN IF YOU JUST DRINK THE DIET SODA IT'S BEEN SHOWN THAT YOU SECRET MUCH MORE INSOLENT THE HORMON THAT REGULATES BLOOD GLUCOS IN RESPONSE TO THAT DIET SODA STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE IN BOTH ADULT HUMANS AND IN HUMAN CHILDREN GENERAL WHEN WE SAY CHILDREN WE MEAN HUMAN CHILDREN BUT JUST TO BE VERY CLEAR WILL ERE TALKING ABOUT EXPLORING CONSUMING DIET SODA WITH OR WITHOUT FOOD THAN LATER CONSUMING JUST THE DIET SODA AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS HAVING PREVIOUSLY CONSUMED DIETSOTA WITH FOOD AND THEN LATER ONLY CONSUMING THE DIET SODA OF COURSE THERE ISN'T AN INCREASE IN BLOOD GLUCOS BECAUSE TEARE NOT BRINGING IN ANY CALORIES WHEN THEY JUST DRINK THE DIET SODA BUT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN INSOLEN RELEASE AND THAT IS SERIOUS IN A TERRIBLE WAY BECAUSE INCREASED RELEASE OF INSOLENT AND SO CALLED INSOLENT SENSITIVITY IS THE BASIS FOR TYPE TO DIABETES SO MUCH SO THAT IN THE STUDY WITH THE CHILDREN CONSUMING NON COLORIC BEVERAGES IN THIS WAY FIRST WITH FOOD AND THEN ON THEIR OWN LET TO INCREASES IN INSOLENT THAT MADE THEM PREDIABETIC AND THAT SHE HAD TO HOLT THE STUDY SO ONE IS ZUME OUT FROM THIS AND JUST REALLY ILLUSTRATE THE MAJOR FINDINGS AND THEN TALK ABOUT HOW THIS CAN BE APPLIED IN THE POSITIVE SENSE I ALSO WOANT A MENSION WHAT THIS MEANS IN TERMS OF YOUR CONSUMPTION OF ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS OF ANY KIND SO FIRST OF ALL THE DIRECT TAKE AWAY ABOUT ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERSE ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS ARE NOT BAD FOR YOU I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THAT WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY IS THAT WHETHER NOT YOU INJEST THEM ALONE OR YOU INJEST THEM IN COLMINATION WITH FOODS OR IS PART OF FOODS THAT RAISE BLOOD GLUCOS IS VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR YOUR INSOLENT MANAGEMENT AND THE SIMPLE EXTRACT OR TOOL FROM THIS IS IF YOU ARE GOING TO CONSUME ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERSE IT'S VERY LIKELY BEST TO CONSUME THOSE AWAY FROM ANY FOOD THAT RAISES BLOOD GLUCOS LEVELS SO IF YOUARE GOING TO ENJOY DIET SODA BE MY GUEST BUT DO IT WHILE NOT WHILE CONSUMING FOOD IN PARTICULAR FOODS THAT RAISE BLOOD GLUCOS BECAUSE WHAT THESE STUDIE SHOW AND I WILL PROVIDE REFERENCES FOR THESE IS THAT THEY CAN VASTLY DISRUPT BLOOD SUGAR MANAGEMENT BY WAY OF THE INSOLENT GLUCO SYSTEM OKI AND ASHILE JUST GIVE YOU THE REFERENCE NOW THIS IS A PAPER A FROM DANA SMALL SLAB THE FIRST AUTHOR IS DALINBURG D A L E N B E RG AND THE TITLE OF THE PAPER IS SHORT TERM CONSUMPTION OF SUCRELOS WITH BUT NOT WITHOUT CARBOHYDRATE IMPAIRS NURL AND METABOLIC SENSITIVITY TO SUGAR INHUMANS THIS IS A PAPER PUBLISH IN SELLMETABOLISM IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PAPER AND SIMILAR FINDINGS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED IN MICE AND ANOTHER STUDIES AND NOW BECAUSE OF THIS PAPER THERE'S NOW A BUNCH OF OTHER GROUPS WORKING ON THIS O THIS ISSUE THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED IN NATURE EXCELLENT TOPTEER JOURNAL AMONG THE SUPERABLE OF TOPTHREE JOURNALS BEING NATURE SCIENCE AND SELL PAPER PUBLISH IN NATURE A FEW YEARS BACK SHOWING THAT PARTICULAR ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS CAN DESTRUP THE GUP MICROBIOM AND HAVE DILITARIOUS HEALFH EFFECTS THAT RESULT I THINK STANDS ALTHOUGH THERE SOME RESULTS THAT A MAY NOT AGREE WITH THAT DEPENDING ON WHETHER OR NOT THE ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERIS SACRIN OR SUCROLOS OR ASPERTAM OR STEVIA THAT'S THE GUP MICROBIOM BUT WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS INDEPENDENT OF THE FORM OF ARTIFICIAL OR NON CLORIC SWEETENER BECAUSE IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A MATCH OR A MISMATCH BETWEEN THE PERCEIVED TASTE AND THE EFFECT OF THE THING THAT YOU ARE CONSUMING ON BLOOD SUGAR AND METABOLISM SO THE FIRST TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IS IF YOU ARE GOING TO CONSUME ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO THAT NOT INCONJUNCTION WITH FOODS THAT INCREASED BLOOD LUCOS SECOND OF ALL IT POINTS TO THE FACT THAT THE FOODS THAT WE PREFER AND THE ACTIVATION OF THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM BOTH THROUGH THE GUT AND AT THE LEVEL OF CONSCIOUS TASTE WHAT IN OTHER WORDS WHAT WE LIKE IS VERY PLASTIC IT'S MUTABLE AND WE CAN CHANGE IT HOW CAN WE CHANGE IT WELL EARLIER I MENTIONED A STRUCTURE IN THE BRAIN CALLED THE INSULA THIS INCREDIBLE STRUCTURE THAT'S INVOLVED IN INTERROCEPTION AND IN TERRACEPTION OF ALL KINDS IN FACT A JUST AS AN ASIDE AYOUROR SO GO MY LAB PUBLISHD A PAPER SHOWING THAT ACTIVITY WITHIN CERTAIN COMPARTMENTS OF THE INSULA OF HUMANS IS RESPONDING TO A HEIGHTENED STATE OF ANXIETY IN THE BODY IT CAN RESPOND TO CHANGES IN OUR RESPIRATION CHANGES IN OUR HEART RATE SO THIS IS AGAIN IT'S A REDOUBT OF OUR INTERNAL STATE NOT JUST OF TASTE BUT OF MANY MANY DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE MECHANICS AND CHEMISTRY OF OUR INTERNAL MIL EW WITHIN OUR BODY ALL OF THE WORK THAT I WAS DESCRIBING PREVIOUSLY HAS ALSO BEEN ADDRESSED AT THE NURAL LEVEL AND USING A BROAD BRUSH TO EXPLAIN THESE RESULTS WHAT WE CAN SAY IS WHEN THERE IS DOPOMINE INCREASE ONE SEES ACTIVATION OF THE SO CALED NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS WHICH IS PART OF THEM SO CALLED MUSOLYMBIC REWARD PATHWAY IF YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE MUSOLYMIC REWARD PATHWAY AND DOPOMINE IN GENERAL AND HUMANS AND IN ANIMAL STUDIES AND ALL THE VARIOUS INCREDIBLE AM AND CHALLENGING THINGS THAT DOPOMINE CAN DO FOR US A THERE'S A EPISODE ALL ABOUT DOPOMINE THAT YOU CAN LOOK UP IT'S EASY TO FIND AT HUBERMEN LAPDOCOM THE INCREASES IN DOPOMINE ASSOCIATE WITH SWEET TASTE AND OR BLOODGLUCOS ELEVATING FOODS AND DRINKS CAUSE ACTIVATION OF THE NUCLES ACCUMBENS THAT'S NOT SURPRIZING ALSO IN THE CIRCUIT IS ACTIVATION OF THE SO CALLED ARCUAT NEUCLYIE WITHIN THE HYPOTHALMUS THES ARE AREAS OF THE HYPOTHALMUS THAT RESPOND TO HORMONS FROM THE BODY AND RESPON TO HORMONS IN NEUROPEPTITES IN THE BRAIN AS WELL AS NEURL SIGNALS IN THE BRAIN TO DRIVE US TO EAT MORE OR TO STOP EATING SO IT'S HYPOTHALMUS NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS THE I A SORT OF THE A HYPOTHALMUS AND THE ARGUIT BEING THE MOTIVATING TO EAT OR MOTIVATING TO STOP EATING BOTH SET OF NARONS ARE OT CONTAIN THERE THEIR OTHER AIRS LIKE THE LATTERAL HYPOTHALMUS AS WELL BUT HYPOTHALMUS A SORT OF THE ACCELERATOR IN THE BREAK ON EATING AND THEN THE NEUCLEUS ACCUMBENS AND DOPOMING RELEASE CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS KIND OF A AM A NITROBOOST IF YOU WILL L THE CUDSAY TO THE CUDSAY THAT ANYMORE ANYWAY A NITROBOOSE TO INCREASE WHAT WE CALL THE GAIN OR THE VOLUME OF HOW MUCH YOU WANT MORE OF SOMETHING KI WEN DOPOMIN IS PRESENT IT'S THIS KIND OF GENERIC SIGNAL TO GO SEEK OUT MORE OF WHATEVER CAUSED THAT RELEASE AND THEN THERE'S THE INSULA THIS VERY THOUGHTFUL RATIONAL NOT REALLY IT'S NOT THINKING IT'S A BRAINAREA YOUR THINKING BUT IT'S PART OF THE AREAS OF YOUR BRAIN THAT ARE INTERPRETING WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR BODY WHETHER NOT YOU FEEL GOOD OR NOT GOOD WHETHER NT YOU FEEL ANXIOUS EXCITED OR FEARFUL IT'S INTEGRATING ALL THAT INFORMATION AND FED IN TO THIS INTIRE CIRCUIT AS WELL ARE THE INPUTS FROM YOUR PREFRONTAL QUARTEXS WHICH IS YOUR THINKING RATIONAL NEURONAL STRUCTURE IF YOU WILL INFORMING YOU FOR INSTANCE AH EH I DON'T REALLY LIKE SAMON VERY MUCH IAM NOT SO CRAZY ABOUT CAL BUT IT HAS OMAGATHREES OR IT'S RICH IN THESE POLYPHINALES THAT ARE GOOD FOR ME ND IF ONE DECIDES THAT THEY ARE GOING TO EAT THESE THINGS NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE GOOD FOR THEM BUT BELIEVE IT ARE NOT IF ONE TAKES THE PERCEPTION OR ADOPTS THE PERCEPTION THAT THEY ARE BOTH GOOD FOR YOU AND THAT IN BEING GOOD FOR YOU THEY ARE GOOD FOR YOUR BRAIN METABOLISM AND THAT YOU DESIRE TO BE HEALTHY AS CRAZY AS IT SOUNDS THOSE SUBJECTIVE SIGNALS OF WHAT YOU TELL YOURSELF ABOUT THE FOODS THAT YOU'RE EATING CAN ACTUALLY IMPACT HOW THOSE FO ODS WILL TASTE MAY BE NOT IMMEDIATELY BUT EVENTUALLY AND CAN IMPACT THE WAY IN WHICH YOUR BODY UTILIZES THOSE FOODS NOW THAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE A ABSOLUTE PIPE DREAM IF I JUST IMAGINE THAT I LIKE MACKEREL MACKEREL WILL START TO TASTE GOOD I'M NOT SAYING THAT I DIDN'T SAY THAT YOU COULD OVERRIDE YUC SIGNALS WITH THIS MECHANISM I DIDN'T SAY THAT YOU COULD TAKE A FOOD THAT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY NOXIOUS TO YOU OR MAKE YOU WANT A VAMI AND OVERRIDE THAT HOWEVER FOODS THAT ARE SOMEWHAT NEUTRAL TO YOU CAN TAKE ON A DIFFERENT VALUE BASED ON THE ACTIVATION OF THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM AND NOW KNOWING WHAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE COUPLEWAYS THAT YOU COULD IMAGINE DOING THAT FIRST OF ALL YOU COULD IN THIS SO CLL GADONCAN OR THOUGHT EXPERIMENT YOU COULD FOR INSTANCE SWAP OUT SUCRELOS BECAUSE SUCRELOS IS JUST A TASTE RITE IS AN ARTIFICIAL SWEET TASTE YOU COULD SWAP THAT OUT AND INSERT CAL BUT EAT THE CAL WITH SOMETHING THAT RAISES BLOOD GLUCOS TO SOME DEGREE OR ANOTHER NOW I'M NOT ENCOURAGING ANY ONE TO RUN OUT THERE IN SPITE THEIR BLOOD GLUCOS LIKE CRAZY AND IN FACT BLOOD GLUCOS IS IN REALLY THE GOAL IF YOU RECALL THE GOAL IS TO GET NURONS TO BE METABOLICALLY ACTIVE WITH THAT BLOOD GLUCOS CAND THAT'S WHAT'S ACTUAL REWARDED AT A SUBSUBCONSCIOUS LEVEL MENI AT A DEEP SUBCONSCIOUS LEVEL BUT CONSUMING THESE FOODS WITH OTHER FOODS THAT INCREASE BLOOD LUCOS AND THEREBY A BRAIN METABOLISM OR I SUPPOSE IF YOU ERE QUITOGENIC HERE A IN THE QUITOSIS A I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RANGE OF FOODS THAT ARE ALLOWED ON QUITOSIS ARE SO I DO'T WANT A MISSPEAK HERE AND U YOU KNOW SAY CRACKER IF WHICH WOULD PROBABLY BE A SIN IN THE CONTEXT OF QUITOSIS AND NO NOCK AGAINST QUITOSIS I'M OFFERING THIS IN IN PART BECAUSE I THINK THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE AND CAN POSITIVELY BENEFIT FROM AQUITOGENIC DIET BUT FOR INSTANCE IF THEREIS A FOOD THAT YOU WANT TO CONSUME MORE OF BUT THAT YOU FIND SOMEWHAT ME OR MILDLY YE YUCH EVEN PARRING IT WITH QUEITONES IF INDEED YOU ARE USING QUEITONES FOR YOUR BRAIN METABOLISM CAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS ON THE QUITOGENIC DIET OVERTIME THAT FOOD WILL BE REENFORCED BY THE DOPOMIN PATHWAY WE KNOW THIS FROM THESE STUDIES WHERE SUCRELOS WAS THE SUBSTANCE PAIRED WITH THE GLUCOS ELEVATING IN OTHER WORDS METABOLICALLY ELEVATING FOOD SUBSTANCE OR LIQUID SUBSTANCE SO HOW DOES ONE GO ABOUT DOING THIS WELL FIRST OF ALL I WANT T EMPHASIZE THAT THIS EXPERIMENT ACTUALLY HAS BEEN DONE IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT CONTEXT STUDIES BY MY COLLIGUE A LEOCRUM IN THE PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT AT STAMFORD HAVE EXPLORED THE BODILY RESPONSE IN TERMS OF INSOLENT RELEASE AND THE RELEASE OF OTHER FOOD AND EATING RELATED HORMONES AS WELL AS OVER ALL FEELINGS OF SATISFACTION ET CETERA IN GROUPS OF PEOPLE THAT DRINK AF MILK SHAKE AND ARE EITHER TOLD THAT IT'S A LOW CALORY SHAKE THAT CONTAINS A VARIOUS NEUTRIANCS THAT ARE GOOD FOR THEM OR A HIGHER CALORY SHAKE THAT HAS A LOT OF NEUTRIANTS ET CETERA AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT THE DIFFERENT GROUPS AND HERE AGAIN ON BEING VERY GENERAL WITH MY DESCRIPTION OF THESE STUDIES BUT WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE THE INSOLENT RESPONSE THE BLOOD LUCOS RESPONSE AND THE SUBJECTIVE MEASURES OF WHETHER NOT PEOPLE ENJOYED SOMETHING OR NOT WERE HEAVILY INFLUENCE BY WHAT THEY WERE TOLD WOR IN THESE MILK SHAKES SO BLOOD GLUCHOSS WOULD GO UP INSOLENT WOULD GO UP WHEN PEOPLE WERE TOLD IT WAS A HIGH CALORY SHAKE WITH LOTS OF NEUTRIANTS LESS SO WHEN PEOPLE INJESTED A SHAKE THAT WAS YOU KNOW THAT THEY WERE TOLD HAD LESS NEUTRIENTS AND SO FORTH WHEN IN REALITY IT WAS THE IDENTICAL SHAKE THIS IS INCREDIBLE THIS IS A BELIEF EFFACT THIS IS NOT PLICIBO RIGHT A PLACIBO EFFECT IS DIFFERENT PLICIBO EFFECT IS IN COMPARISON IT'S WHERE THE CONTROL CONDITION ACTUALLY INFLUENCE IS OUTCOMES TO A SAME OR TO SOME DEGREE JUST LIKE THE EXPERIMENTAL CONDITION THIS IS NOT A PLICIBO EFFECT THIS IS A BELIEF EFFECT WHERE THE BELIEF AND THE SUBJECTIVE THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT A GIVEN FOOD WILL DO HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON A PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURE LIKE BLOOD SUGAR AND BLOOD LUCOS SO LET ZUMOUT FROM THIS FOR A SECOND AND THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN INCORPORATE THIS IN TO ADOPTING CONSUMPTION OF HEALTHY FOODS THAT SERVE ARE BRAIN HEALTH AND THE IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT THOSE ARE E LISTED THEM OUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE AND THEIR JUSTIFICATION FOR BEING ON THAT LIST WHAT THIS MEANS IS OBVIOUSLY YOU WANT TO CONSUME FOODS THAT YOU LIKE BUT BECAUSE BRAIN HEALTH IS VERY IMPORTANT AND MANY OF THE FOODS THAT PROMOTE BRAIN HEALTH PERHAPS ARE NOT THE MOST PALITABLE TO YOU OR DESIRABLE TO YOU THE QEY WOULD BE TO INJEST THE FOODS THAT YOU WANT TO INJEST MORE OF SIMPLY BECAUSE THEIR GOOD FOR YOU AND NOT BECAUSE THEY TASTE GOOD TO YOU A LONGSIDE FOODS THAT INCREASE WHATEVER FUEL SYSTEM YOU HAPPEN TO BE RELYING ON I THINK THAT'S THE MOST A NUTRITIONALLY POLITICALLY CORRECT WAY TO SAY IT SO IF YOUR QUITO THAT WOULD MEAN QUITONES A IF YOU ARE NOT QUITOGENIC AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY ARE NOT IN QUITOSIS ARE TRYN TO MAINTAIN QUITOSIS BUT FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON A PURELY PLANT BASDYET THAT WOULD BE ONE SET OF FOODS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE OMNIVORS A DIFFERENT SET OF FOODS AND FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE CORNVORS YET ANOTHER SET OF FOODS IF YOU WANT TO EAT MORE OF OUR PARTICULAR FOOD BECAUSE IT'S GOOD FOR YOU PARIT WITH SOMETHING IN THE SAME MEAL YOU DON'T HAVE TO HIDE IT PHYSICALLY OR IN THE FLAVOR SENSE YOU ON'T AVE TO HIDE IT WITHIN THAT OTHER FOOD BUT PARROT WITH THAT OTHER FOOD THAT PROVIDES YOU A SHIFT IN BRAIN METABOLISM BECAUSE THATS REALLY WHAT YOUR BRAIN AND YOU ARE SEEKING EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T REALIZE HOW LONG WILL THIS TAKE WELL ACCORDING TO THE DATA AND HUMANS ON SUCRELOS AND THE CONDITIONING FOR SUCRELOS TO HAVE THESE EFFACTS WHICH IN MANY CASES WERE DETRIMENTAL RIGHT BECAUSE THEY WERE INCREASING INSOLENT BUT IN THIS CASE YOU'RE TRYING TO HYJACK THIS CONDITIONING OF FOOD PREFERENCE FOR HEALTHY PURPOSES NOT WITH SUCRELOS BUT BY INJESTING THINGS THAT ARE GOOD FOR YOU THEN THE DATA REALLY POINT TO THE FACT THAT EVEN WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME OF ABOUT SEVEN DAYS BUT CERTAINLY WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS THAT FOOD WILL TAKE ON A SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF TASTING AT LEAST BETTER TO YOU IF NOT GOOD TO YOU NOW I BELIEVE THIS HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONSE FOR MUCH OF THE CONTROVERSY AND FOOD WARS THAT WE SEE OUT THERE FOOD WARS BEING OF COURSE THES GROUPS THAT ARDENTLY SUBSCRIBE TO THE IDEA THAT THERE DIET AND THE THINGS THAT THEY ARE EATING ARE THE FOODS THAT ARE GOOD FOR US AND THAT ARE THE MOST PLEASUREFUL AND THE THINGS THAT EVERYONE SHOULD BE EATING WE SEE THIS WITH EVERY COMMUNITY WITHIN THE NUTRITIAN REALM NOW OF COURSE THERE ARE STUDIES THAT POINT TO THE FACT THAT CERTAIN FOODS AND FOOD COMPONENTS ARE HEALTHIER PROBABLY FOR US AND FER THE PLANET BUT YOU REALLY SEET ON BOTH ENDS OF THE SPECTRUM YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE WHO ARE ON A PURE CARNIVORE DIET WHO ARE ARGUING WITH A LOT OF BIOMEDICAL EVIDENCE THAT THAT'S WHAT'S BEST FOR US AND BENEFICIAL AND THEN YOU GOT PEOPLE THAT ARE ARGUING THE SAME GENERAL SETS OF ARGUMENTS BUT FOR A PURELY PLANTBASE DIET AND THEN I THINK MOST PEOPLE FALLENTO THE OMNIVORE CATEGORY WHAT'S VERY CLEAR HOWEVER IS THAT WHAT WE CONSUME ON A REGULAR BASIS AND WHAT LEADS TO INCREASES IN BRAIN METABOLISM LEADS TO INCREASES IN DOPOMINE AND THEREBY AR MOTIVATION TO EAT THEM SO WHAT THIS REALLY SAYS IS THAT WHAT WE TEND TO DO REGULARLY BECOMES REENFORCING IN AND OF ITSELF AND I THINK ENLARGE PART CAN EXPLAIN THE FACT THAT YES INDEED FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE A GIVEN DIET NOT ONLY FEELS GOOD BUT THEY HEAVILY SUBSCRIBE TO THE NUTRIENT AND KIND OF HEALTH BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF THAT DIET AND THEY OFTEN WILL PROVIDE EVIDENCE FOR THAT WHETHER NOT YOU ASK THEM FOR IT OR NOT BUT THAT'S TRUE OF EVERY SUBCATEGORY WITHIN THE NUTRICIAN REALM AGAIN THIS IS NOT TO TAKE AWAY FROM SOME OF THE BEAUTIFUL DATA EMPHASIZING THAT CERTAIN FOODS AND MICRONUTRIENTS ET CETERA ARE BETTER FOR US OR WORSE FOR US AND FER THE PLANET IT'S NOT A DEBATE I WANT TO GET INTO RIGHT NOW WHAT IT BUT THIS EMPHASIZES IS THAT FOODS IMPACT OUR BRAIN AND ITS HEALTH BUT THAT THEY ALSO IMPACT HOW OUR BRAIN FUNCTIONS AND RESPONSE TO FOOD AND THAT IS LARGELY A LEARNED RESPONSE WE CAN'T COMPLETELY OVER RIDE FOR INSTANCE THAT CERTAIN FOODS EVOKE A STRONG THE YUCH COMPONENT CERTAIN FOODS ARE TRULY PUTRED TO US I SHOULD JUST SAY CERTAIN THINGS ARE PUTURE TO US AND WE SHOULD NOT CONSU N THEM RIGHT AND NOTS A AT THE FAR END OF THE SPECTRUMITS HARD WIRED FOR US TO AVOID THOSE BECAUSE THEY CAN BE DANGEROUS FOR US THAT CAN MAE US VERY VERY SICK BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT IF WE CONTINUE TO EAT FOODS THAT ARE PROGRESSIVELY SWEETER AND SWEETER AND HIGHLY PALATABLE IT SHIFTS OUR DOPEMING SYSTEM BECAUSE IT ACTIVATES OUR DOPEMINE SYSTEM TO MAKE US BELIEVE THAT THOSE FOODS ARE THE ONLY FOODS THAT CAN TRIGGER THIS REWARD SYSTEM AND MAKE US FEEL GOOD AND TASTE AND THAT THEY TASTE GOOD BUT AFTER CONSUMING FOODS THAT PERHAPS ARE LESS SWEET OR EVEN LESS SAVORY THAT ARE NOT WHAT WE CALL HIGHLY OR I WOULD SAY NOWDAYS AT SUPERPALATABLE FOODS WE CAN ADJUST OUR SENSE LITERALLY OF WHAT WE PERCEIVE AS AN ATTRACTIVE AND REWARDING FOOD AND INDEED THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM WILL REWARD THOSE FOODS ACCORDINGLY I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW MUCH THIS LEARNING OF ASSOCIATED FOOD REWARD IS IMPORTANT FOR NOT JUST UNDERSTANDING WHY WE LIKE THE FOODS THAT WE EAT AND HOW TO EAT MORE OF FOODS THAT ARE HEALTHY FOR US AND ENJOY THEM BUT IT ALSO SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT OUR BRAIN AS A WHOLE IS A PERCEPTIULE DEVICE TRYING TO MAKE GUESSES OR ESTIMATIONS ABOUT WHAT CERTAIN FOODS ARE GOING TO DO FOR US SO PUT SIMPLY WE DON'T JUST LIKE SWEET FOODS BECAUSE THEY TASTE GOOD WE LIKE THEM BECAUSE THEY PREDICT A CERTAIN KIND OF METABOLIC RESPONSE THIS IS IMPORTANT ALSO BECAUS DAIN A SMALL AND IVAN DERUJO AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN EXPLORING WHEATHER OR NOT PEOPLE FOR INSTANCE THAT HAVE TYPE TO DIABETES OR THAT SUFFER FROM ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT METABOLIC DISORDERS WHETHER NOT SOMEHOW THESE FOOD REWARD SYSTEMS ARE PERMANENTLY DISRUPTED AND THROUGH A BEAUTIFUL SET OF EXPERIMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE BY MAINLY BY DAIN A SMALL SCROUP AT YALE BUT ALSO BY THE DERUJO GROUP AND OTHERS EXPLORING HOW THE REWARD PATHWAYS OR ALTERED IN VARIOUS METABOLIC DISORDERS ET CETERA PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM TITO DIBEDES WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO INTO ALL THOSE DATA NOW BUT THE TAKE AWAY IS THAT FOOD PREFERENCE AND THE ABILITY TO RESHAPE THESE CIRCUITS IS NOT DISRUPTED IN THESE PEOPLE TO THE POINT WHERE IT CAN'T BE REWIRED AND THAT'S VERY ENCOURAGING BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM THESE SYNDRUMS THROUGH SOME SIMPLE ALTERATIONS IN DIETARY CHOICE PROVIDED THOSE ARE CARRIED OUT OVER TIME AND IN THE CORRECT WAY BY PARING WITH THE FOODS THAT WILL APPROPRIATELY SHIFT METABOLISM OF THE BRAIN ONE CAN ACTUALLY REWIRE WHAT THEY CONSIDER NOT JUST PALATABLE BUT ATTRACTIVE AS FOODS IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT FOOD REWARD AND FOOD REENFORCEMENT ECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THOSE ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFEREN THINGS THERE'S A WONDERFUL REVIEW WRITTEN BY IVAN DERUJO THEY HAVE A MIDDLE AUTHOR MAR TACTOR AND DAIN A SMALL IT' CALLED RETHINKING FOOD REWARD AND IT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE ANNUAL REVIEWS OF PSYCHOLOGY HE CAN FIND IT VERY EASILY ON LINE WAS PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DEEP DIVE ALTHOUGH QUITE ACCESSIBLE TO MOST PEOPLE ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT FOODS IN THE WAY THAT WE PERCEIVE THEM IMPACTS OUR BRAIN AND BODY AND WHY WE LIKE THE THINGS WE LIKE AND HOW TO RESHAPE WHAT WE LIKE SO ONCE AGAIN WE'AVE DONE A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE DEEP DIVE IN TO FOOD AND YOUR BRAIN FOCUSING FIRST ON HOW PARTICULAR FOODS AND COMPOUNDS WITHIN FOODS THAT ARE AVAILABLE ALSO THROUGH SUPPLEMENTATION CAN IMPACT IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM BRAIN HEALTH CAME UP WITH A RELATIVELY SHORT LIST OF WHAT I WOULD CALL SUPER FOODS ONLY BECAUSE A THERE ARE AMPLE DATA TO SUPPORT THEIR ROLL IN ENHANCING SHORT AND LONG TERM COGNITION AND EURONAL HEALTH AND SO ON AND WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT FOOD PREFERENCE AND WHY PARTICULAR TASTES AND PARTICULAR EVENTS WITHIN THE GUT AND PARTICULAR EVENTS WITHIN THE BRAIN COMBINE TO LEAD US TO PURSUE PARTICULAR FOODS AND TO AVOID OTHER FOODS AND HOW YOU CAN LEVERAGE THOSE PATHWAYS IN ORDER TO PURSUE MORE OF THE FOODS THAT ARE GOING TO BE GOOD FOR YOU AND GOOD NOT JUST FOR YOUR BRAIN BUT FOR YOUR OVERALL BODY HEALTH AND TO ENJOY THEM ALONG THE WAY IF YOU'RE LEARNING FROM AND OR ENJOING THIS PODCAST PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO OUR OU TUB CHANNEL THAT'S A TERRIFIC ZERO COSTWAY TO

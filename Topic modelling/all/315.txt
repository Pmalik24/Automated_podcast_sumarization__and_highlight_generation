SOME ONE AND AND YOU KNOW THEY SPENT THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS GOING THROUGH EVERYTHING CHIN AND CHAY MADE A LONG TURN PLAN IN A SHORT TURN PLAN LONG TURN THEY WERE GOING TO ESCAPE BUT THEY WOULD WAIT TILL THEY COULD DO IT RIGHT SO THEY WOULDN'T BE CAUGHT THEIR SHORT TURN PLAN YINVOLVED A SMALL TAPERQUARTER WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO GET BECAUSE ONE OF THE WEIRD PRIVILEGES OF THEIR CAPTIVITY WAS THAT THEY WERE ALLOWED TO SHOP AT A DEPARTMENT STORE THAT SOLD THINGS THAT WERE OUT OF REACH FOR MOST PEOPLE ON THE COUNTRY LIKE TAPERQUARTERS KIM JOHNGILL HAD LONG AND SHORT TURN PLANS OF HIS OWN FOR THEM HE TOLD THEM THAT SOON HE WOULD SUMMON THEM TO TALK ABOUT HIS VISION FOR THEIR FUTURE THEN SEVEN MONTHS WENT BY AND DURING THOSE MONTHS SCHIN AND CHA SPENT HOURS NEARLY EVERY WEEK AND KIM'S HUGE FILM ARCIVE HE WANTED CHIN AND CHAY TO SEE IT AND BE IMPRESSED AND THEY WERE IM DIDN'T JUST LOVE THEIR MOVIES HE LOVED ALL MOVIES IT WAS AGAINST THE LAW FOR ORDINARY NORTH CAREANS TO WATCH FAREIGN FILMS BUT KIM HAD SET UP A MASSOF BOOTLEGGING OPERATION RUNNING IN COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE WORLD SO HE COULD BUILD UP HIS PRIVATE COLLECTION WITD EVERY MOVIE EVER MADE OR AS CLOSE AS HE COULD GET THE ARCIVE WAS THREE STORIES HIGH AND HEAVILY GUARDED AT LEAST TWO SCREENING ROOMS ALL FOR KIM ONLY AND NOW FOR CHIN AND CHAY CHIM WAS BOWLED OVER BY EVERY DETAIL YOU KNOW THE TO WAY THE BUILDING ITSELF WAS SET UP TO RUN AND AND YOU KOW IT ADMIRATION OVER HOW KIM HAD SET UP HIS OWN ARKIVAN AND HOW WELL EVERYTHING WAS KAPT YOU KNOW GEEKING OUT OVER THE AR CONDITIONING SAT THINGS AND HOW HE WAS PRESERVING THE SETELOID AND YOU KNOW HOW EVERYTHING WAS CATHALOGUE THAN THE STAFF AND HOW LARGE IT WAS HOW AS IT CATEGORIZED WAS IT BY YEAR OR BY JONRA OR BY DIRECTOR AND WENT BY COUNTRY FIRST AND I THINK HEY WENT BY YEAR AS THEY GOT THE IN AND AND THERE'S THAT LOVELY TATCH WHERE YOU KNOW THE SOUTH REAN FILMS IN A KIND OF NORMAL AIR CONDITIONING ROOM AND AND THE NORTH GREAN FILMS AN A MUST LAVISH STORGE AN SCREENING RIM N OLL BILL DING  THE FILMS WERE DUBBED INTO CAREIN AFTER BEING PAINSTAKENG WI TRANSCRIBE SOMETIMES BY AMERICANS THERE WAS AN AMERICAN DEFECTOR HE WAS ONE OF SEVERAL ACTUALLY WHO'D BEEN THERE SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE AND ONE OF HIS JOBS WAS TRANSCRIBING AMERICAN FILMS BUT JUST BY LISTENING ECAUSE HE WASN'T ALLOWED TO WATCH THEM YET AND HE WOULDN'T KNOW THAT THEY WERE FILMS BECAUSE THEY GAVE HIM ANY OTHER AMERICAN EFACTORS THE AUDIO FOR SOME REASON THEY CHOPPED UP THE FILMSANTRACTS INTO THEI FERENT BITS IN THE LONG ORDERS THAT HEY WOULDN'T NO I GES THEY EN DOING EXACTLY ENJOY THEM BUT HE HAD THIS EXPERIENCE OF OF IN A TRANSCRABING HIM AN SUNLY REALIZEING WHY THIS IS MA POPINS  CIN AN CHASPENT DOZENS AND DOZENS OF HOURS WATCHING ONE MOVI AFTER ANOTHER IN THE SCREENING ROOMS THAT THE FILM ARCIVE AND IN THEIR VILLA WHICH WAS ALSO OUTFITTED TO SHOW MOVIES THEY DO THAT FOR MONTHS UNTIL FINALLY THEY GOT WORD KIM IS READY TO MEET WITH YOU THEY WENT AND THEY BROUGHT THE TAPE RECORTER AND THE SECOND THEY WALKED IN AND CHAY HAD THE TAPEQUARTER AND HER A PERSE AN TRY FLICTED ON AND I THINK UNEXPECTEDLY KIMDRUNGEL JUS TALKED AT THEM MOSTLY FOR TWO HOURS N A KIM RINGL SPOKE VERY VERY FAST AND HIS MIND SOUT OF WENT ALL OVER THE PLACE AND HE HAD A VERY INTIMODATE THING WAT THER SLASH BODY GUARD WHO KEPT WALKING IN TO TO REFILL DRANK AND EMPTY ASH TRACE CHIN AND CHA WANTED TO RECORD KIM FOR TWO REASONS FIRST THEY KNEW THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO ESCAPE MAYBE THEY WOULD BE KILLED AND THEIR CHILDREN AND FRIENDS WOULD JUST NEVER KNOW WHAT HID HAPPENED TO THEM OR ACCORDING IF THEY COULD SMUGGLE IT OUT WOULD AT LEAST BE PROOF OF WHERE THEY'D BEEN THE SECOND REASON TO RECORD HIM WAS THAT THEY KNEW THAT KIM WOULD INSIST THEY SAY PUBLICLY THAT THEY HAD COME TO NORTH CAREA ON THEIR OWN VOLUNTARILY CHIN AND CHAY WERE HOPING THAT IN THEIR PRIVATE CONVERSATION KIM MIGHT ADMIT TO HAVING HAD THEM KIDNAPPED AND BROUGHT TO HIM AND HE ALMOST ALMOST DID BY MAKING A JOKE IN THE FIRST COUPLE OF MINUTES OF THEIR CONVERSATION KIM TALKED ABOUT HOW HE' BROUGHT CHA OVER FIRST IN ORDER TO ENTICE CHIN TO NORTH CAREE I SAYD JOKE BECAUSE KIM LAUGHS AS HE SAYS IT AND THEN ALL THREE OF THEM LAC   IT'S TYRANT MANAGEMENT ONE O ONE FHE LAUGHED YOU LAUGH THE REST OF WHAT KIM SAID IN THAT CONVERSATION WELL HE SEID A LOT OF THINGS BUT THE MAIN THING WAS NORTH CAREE AND MOVIES ARE BAD AND I AM SICK OF IT THEY WERE MAKING THE SAME FILM OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND THAT THEY WERE TOO LONG AND TO BORING AND LIKE HISTORY LESSONS AND AND TO MO THE DRAMATIC AND TAND SAYS THERE'S TOO MUCH CRYING AT IN TELL ANYBODY BUT IN SO MUCH CRYING KIMJON YEL TOLD SHIN AND CHAY THAT HE KNEW HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE COUNTRY WHO COULD GET AWAY WITH SAYING WHAT HE WAS SAYING AND HE TOLD THEM NOT TO REPEAT ANY OF IT HE SAID WHEN IT COMES TO MOVIES WE ARE IN KINDERGARTEN AND OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE SOUTH CAREEA ARE IN COLLEGE HE SAID IF WE DON'T CATCH UP IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS OUR MOVIES ARE GOING TO BE THE WORST OF THE WORST MOVIES IN THE WORLD THE PROBLEM HE SAID JUST BETWEEN US IS THE PEOPLE IN NORTH CAREA HAD IT TOO EASY THEY HAD THINGS HANDED TO THEM E HAVE TO HOSTLE LIKE SHIN AND CHADED THERE'S A POINT AN TA THIG WET HE TELLS THEM THAT E NO AN I THINK IN E SAYS I PARFIRS THE BAY SAYS NAT THERE'S NO INSENTIVE AND SOCIALISM TGINUBET  AY HID AN AS MIGHT MIGHT SCREEN WRITERS I AT THEY'LL RIGHT SOMETHING THEY'LL GET THEIR ASIONS A THE OTHER GIS MAK A FILM TOT AT THEIR ASSIONS I THE CAPAID NO MATTER WHAT THEYN THAT ATES TURN OUT THAT THE WORK EXACTLY UNFOLLOW ORDERS IM ANY THIM VERY CONSCIOUS THAT EIN I NEEDS SOME ONE HE HE BUSHES HIMSELF MORE THAN THAT WHO'S USE TO HAVING TO DO MORE THAN THAT THE EARNEST KEEP KIM JHN YEL NEVER MENTIONED ANOTHER POSSIBLE REASON WHY NORTH CREE'S MOVIES WERE WOODEN AND UNAMBITIOUS LIKE FEAR HE KIM JOHN YILL HAD WRITTEN THE BOOK THE ONLY BOOK IN NORTH CAREE ABOUT THE RIGHT WAY TO MAKE MOVIES AND THINK ABOUT MOVIES IT'S CALLED ON THE ART OF THE SINNAMA IT'S STILL IN PRINT EVERY ONE INVOLVED IN NORH CRE'S FILM INDUSTRY IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES HAD TO HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF DOING SOMETHING AS UNPATRIOTIC OR INSULTING AS TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT ARTISTIC VISION WITHOUT KIM'S EXPLICIT BLESSING AND HIS FATHERS IT WAS BETTER TO BE CRAPPY THAN SORRY THE CONVERSATION CONTINUED CHIN AND CHAY MURMURED THAT NORTH CAREA'S CITIZENS WERE FORTUNATE TO HAVE A COMRADE LEADER WHO UNDERSTOOD FILM SO WELL KIM JON YILL AGREED WITH HIS PERMISSION THE THREE OF THEM GOT INTO CROTIKING SPECIFIC FILMS A NORTH CREE AN ONE CALLED THE STARVOE CAREE AND WHILE THEY WERE AT IT A SOVI AT FILM CALLED MOTHER HAT HAD A DYING SCENE THEY ALL AGREED HAD BEEN ATROCIOUS THEY WERE THREE MOVI LOVERS TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY LOVED AND KIM JON YLL'S BIG PLAN FOR SHIN AND CHA WAS THAT HE WANTED THEM TO MAKE NORTH CAREENE MOVIES GOOD SO THAT THEY COULD COMPETE WITH FILMS COMING OUT OF THE WEST AND WHEN AWARDS AND BE SHOWN IN THEATERES ALL OVER THE WORLD HE WANTED CHAY TO ACT TO THE MOVIES AND CHIN TO DIRECT THEM CHINM COULD HAVE HIS OWN FILM COMPANY JUST LIKE HE USED TO HAVE CHIN WANTED TO CALL THE COMPANY SHIN FILM A VERY BOLD REQUEST IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES HE HAN NOTHING IN NORTH WE HAD BEEN CALLED ANYTHING OTHER THAND E KNOT THE WORK IS PARADISE THAYS AT A PART HE THIS AT A SUPREMELYA THIS OR NO KIMILSONG UNIVERSITY IM SO WAS AT BIG KIEL BUT US ALSO INO VERY TELLING OF SHIN THAT EVEN IN THIS SEVEAL SITUATION HIS FIRST INSTINCT IS O KICOCOKABUT CAN NOT GIVE THE COMPANY MY NAME  ININ IN FILM NOIR SOME ONE IS ALWAYS USING SOMEWHAT AND OFTEN PEOPLE ARE USING EACH OTHER AND WE DON'T FIND OUT TILL THE END WHO GETS AWAY WITH WHAT CHIN AND CHAY KNEW THAT THEIR ONLY CHANCE OF ESCAPE WOULD BE TO CONVINCE KIM JOHN ALE TO LET THEM FILM AND WORK IN THE WEST KIM JOHN ILL KNEW THAT IF HE WANTED GOOD MOVIES HE HAD TO GIVE SHIN AND CHA ENOUGH FREEDOM TO CREATE THEM SO ALL THREE OF THEM WANTED TO MAKE GREAT MOVIES BUT SAME BED DIFFERENT DREAMS CIM JANGAL WON ED THE FILMS FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES AND ANEED OF THE FILMS THOY GET AWAY FROM HIM  AND IT ALMOST LIKE HIS AMBITION OF MAKING FILM WITH THE WORLD OF RESPECT COMPLETELY OVERTOOK ANY SENSE OF LOGIC SO THE FIRST FILMSION AND CHAY AM SHA HAD SEQUENCES THAT THEY SHOT AND EAST IN EUROPE STANDING IN FOR THE HAGUE AND OU NOW THO SHOWED CIM DUING EL TE FILM AM HE SAID THIS IS FANTASTIC IT'S LIKE A EUROPEAN FILM IT'S THE BEST THING WE'V EVER MADES ALAD HIM T START SHOWING IT AND I NEVER CROSS HIS MIND THAT THEY HAD DONE EXACTLY WHAT HE'D FORBIDDEN HIS OWN FILM MAKERS TO DO FOR EVER FOR REASON THEY BEEN FORBIDDEN TO SHOW THE WORLD OUTSIDE NORTH CAREE THEY SHOWED PEOPLE THINGS THAT THEY HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE OU N ALMOST IN A LIFETIME FOR SOME PEOPLE IN NORTH CAREA ABOYUT NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE NINET INTY FOR AND A SECONDS THAT FILM SIRY PLAYING IN SINIMAS IN NORTH CAREA OU KNOW THE NORTH GREEN AUDIENCES DIDN'T TAKE IN NECESSARILY THE

KIM EXISTS KIM JENIAL HAD TOLD SHIN AND CHA IN THE RECORTING THAT WHEN PEOPLE ASKED THEM WHY THEY WERE IN NORTH CAREE THEY SHOULD SAY FREEDOM FOR TRUE ARTISTIC FREEDOM FOR CHIN THERE WERE SOME BITTER TRUTH TO THAT BECAUSE SOUTH CAREE AT THE TIME SHIN AN CHA WERE KIDNAPE HAD BEEN A MILITARY DICTATORSHIP WITH VERY HEAVY HANDED CENSORS SHIN STUDIO HAD BEEN SHUT DOWN BY THE SOUTH CAREAN GOVERNMENT IN

DONALD TRUMP IS THE PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN NOMINATE I KNOW IT'S EARLY I KNOW IT'S THE DAY AFTER THE IOWA CAWCASES BUT LET'S FACE FACTS HERE FOLKS DONALD TRUMP IS SO FAR OUT AHEAD OF THE REST OF THE FIELD THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS A PLAUSIBLE SHOT AT THE NOMINATION THAT WAS CONFIRMED LAST NIGHT IN THE IWA CAWCASES WHEN DONALD TRUMPET BROKE FIFTY PER CENT AND NONE OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES WAS ABLE TO BREAK TWENTY TWO PER CENT THAT IS AN INSURMOUNTABLE LEAD FOR ZONALD TRUMP IN THESE PRIMARIES SO LAST NIGHT THE IA CAWCAES OPEND AT SEVEN P M LOCAL TIME AND BY SEVEN THIRTY EVERY MAJOR OUTLET WAS CALLING THE IWA CAWCSES FOR DONAL TRUMP NOWS BRY CONTROVERSAL THIS CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE THE RESTILL PEOPLE WHO NOT ONLY HAD VOTED THEY HADINGBEN STARTED THE SPEECH MAKING PROCESS THE WAY THE COC'S WORK ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE AS THE PEOPLE SHOW UP IN THESE LOCAL LOCATIONS AND ALL VARIOUS CANDIDATES HAVE THEIR SURGATE TO COME AND MAKE SPEECHES AND THEN EVERYBODY VOTES THE REASON THAT ALL OF THESE OUTLETS WERE ABLE TO MAKE THIS CALL SO EARLY IS BECAUSE OF COURSE THE POLLING DATA IN FROMS O ENTRANCE PULLING SHOWED TRUMP SO FAR OUT AHEAD THAT THERE WAS NO PLAUSIBLE CHALLENGER NOT A LOT OF QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER THESE OUTLETS SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT BECAUSE AFTER ALL LITERALLY ZERO VOTES HAD BEEN COUNTED HAD THE ONE AT WHICH ALL OF TESE PROJECTIONS WERE MADE AND TERE 'S LOT OF QUESTION FROM THE DISANCIS CAMPAT FROM THE HAILEY CAMP ABOUT WHETHER THAT AFFECTED WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE THE ACTUAL CAUCAS CALLS THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHOERE CHECKING THEIR PHONESING THE FOX NEWS FOR EXAMPLE HAD CALLED THE RACE AND SIMPLY SIDE OCAWALL I'M HERE ANYWAY A MAZELS VOTE FOR THE GUY WHO AN MAZWALL VOTE FOR TRUMP HERE IS WHAT IT SOUNDED LIKE WHEN ALL OF THESE VERYUS OUTLETS CALLED THE RACE EXTREMELY EARLY SEEN IT PROJECTS THE DONAL TRUMP WILLWIN THE IOWA CAWCASES SAN IN CAN MAKE THIS PROJECTIN BASE DUNK IS OVERWHELMING WEAD IN OUR ENTRANCE POLL OF IWER CAWCAS GOERS AND SOME INITIAL VOTES THET AR COMING IN THE FORMER PRESENT PULLING OFF A HUGE EARLY VICTORY IN IS BOOD TO RETURN THROUGH THE WHITE COU TRM  CI TO E E ENY ANTY THINI NE NAL PE TA A THIS HOUR AT EIGHT THRTY THREE T  TE THRE THREE TA  CO T THRE THRENY  TOE THRE TH TAE CI THAT CON O THEN DONNAL T TO  WELL TITY TE  THI WEN  INTHE IL CAKA TI N TEN T O PESE THA TAL ALACXAN THOBASTO IN THE FIRST FIRSALT AN OUR FOXIS VOTER AND ALXIS THE FOXINS DECISION DATH CAN OUT PROJACT THAT FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRO TWELL WAN TE IOWA CAWCAS THAT YOU THE OE IR O THE TIX FOORTY DELEGANST THIS RESULT REALLY SOLIDIVIXE HIS PLACE HAS THE CO CRO RONER THROR THE NOMINATION NOW AGEN MANY OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES WERE CRYING FOUL AT THIS POINT NOT BECAUSE TRUMP WASN'T GOING TO WIN HE WAS BUT BECAUSE THEY SAID THAT THE MAY OF SHIFTED THE MARGIN O VICTORY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS FOR EXAMPLE HAS A POLICY HAT THEY WILL NOT CALL THE WINTER OF RACE BEFORE ALL THE POLES IND JURISDICTION ARE SCHEDUAL TO CLOSE PETTY MUCH ALL OF THEM CALLED NOT ONLY BEFORE THE POLES WERE SCEDUAL TO CLOSE BUT BEFORE SOME OF THE POLESHAD HAD EVEN OPEN NOW WAS THAT GOING TO CHANGE THE TROJECTORY OR THE SHAPE OF THIS RACE I HAVE VERY SERIOUS DOUBTS THAT THAT IS THE CASE THE FINAL RESULTS IN IOWA AGAIN DONALD TRUMP FIFTY ONE PER CENT FOLLOWED BY GOVERNOR R N TO SANTUS OF FLORIDA THE GOT I WOULD HA VOTED FOR IN THE PRIMARIES AT TWENTY ONE PER CENT FOLLOWED BY FORMER SOUTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR AND YOU AN AMBASSADOR N NIKEE HAILEY AT NINETEEN PER CENT SO MAYBE T WOULD SHIFTED THINGS AT THE MARGINS O COUPLE OF PERCENTAGE POINTS EITHER WAY IT WAS NOT GOING TO DETRACT FROM DONAL TRUMPS MASSIVE BLOW OUT VICTORY THE REASON FOR DONALD TRUMPS MASSIVE BLOW OUT VICTORY IS PRETTY SIMPLE REPUBLICAN VOTER SEE DONAL TRUMP IS THE INCUMBENT IT IS THAT SIMPLE HE'S BEING TREATED AS THE INCUMBENT AND HE PERFORMED LIKEAN INCUMBENT WOOLD IN AND IWALL CAWCAS IF JOBIDON WERE ACTUALLY RUNNING IN AND IWALL CAWCAS THIS YEAR IF THERE WERE SOME SORT OF CAUCAS PROCESS IN I WITH THIS YEAR YOU OULD EXPECT THAT JOBIDON WOULD RECEIVE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SIXTY AND SEVENTY PER CENT OF THE VOTE AND THAT A COUPLE CHALLENGERS MIGHT PEEL OFF TEN PER CENT HERE AND THERE THAT IS ESSENTIALLY HOW THE POLES HAVE BEEN PLAYING FOR DONALD TRUMP IN IOWA BASICALLY SINCE JULY OF THIS YEAR THE TRUTH IS THAT WHATEVER VULNERABILITY DONALD TRUMP HAD AS A CANDIDATE IT BEGAN IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND IT ENDED BY BASICALLY MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY THREY IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY THREE DONALD TRUMP WAS WIDELY PERCEIVED BY THE REPUBLICAN BAS AS A PERSON WHO CAUSED REPUBLICANS TO LOSE BECAUSE THE TWENTY TWENTY TO ELECTIONS BUT REALLY POORLY AND SO WHAT YOU SAW IS THA IF YOU GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT  DONALD TRUMP HAD NAN ADVANTAGE OVER ON TO SANTIS BUT NOT MUCH OF ONE NATIONALLY SPEAKING DESANTUS WAS PERCEIVED AS A WINNER BECAUSE YET A BLOW OUT VICTORY HERE IN FLORDA AND DONAL TRUMP WAS PERCEIVED AS A PERSON WHO CAUSED OTHER CANDIDATES TO LOSE BECAUSE HE HAD HAD A BUNCH OF SENATE CANDIDATES WHO LOST GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO TWENTY TWENTY WHEN HE PROMOTED THE LOSS OF TWO SEPARATE REPUBLICAN SENATORS IN GEORGIA BUT THE SANCITON TRUMPIN FAST ENOUGH NO ONE REDO FIND TRUMP AS THE LOSER AND SO WHAT TRUMP DID SMART POLITICS HE KEPT CLAMMING THAT HE WAS THE ACTUAL WINNER OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION BY EXIPULLING IN REPUBLICANS BELIEVE HIM THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED THE IWALL CAWCAS IS SEVENTY PER CENT BELIEF THAT HE ACTUALLY ONE THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS TRUE THEY BELIEVE THAT AND IF YOUARE THAT VOTER AND YOU THINK HE WON TWICE WHY WOULD YOU NOT VOTE FOR HIM THE CHIEF ARGUMENT AGAINST DONALD TRUMP ALL ALONG WAS LECTABILITY WHO IS NEVER CHARACTER BECAUSE CHARACTER AT MATTERED THAN WOUT A MATTERED A LOT EARLIER AND IT WAS I'N PER FORMANCE BECAUSE MOST REPUBLICANS BY INLARGE WERE FAIRLY HAPPY WITH DONALD TRUMPS POLICY PERFORMANCE AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE TWENTY TWENTY YEAR WAS REALLY BAD FOR DONAL TRUMP THE REAL RUT NOK ON TRUMP WAS THAT HE WAS NOT ELECTABLE WHICH MEANS THAT THERE WERE TWO ASSETS THAT DONAL TRUMP HAD ONE WAS THAT PEOPLE IN THEREPUBLICAN PARTY STILL REALTHE LOVE DONAL TRUMP THEREIS AT THAT'S JUST THE SIMPLE FACT TO THE MATTER IS AN ENORMOUS MOUNT OF LOYALTY AMONG REPUBLICAN VOTERS  PEOPLE PERSONALLY LIKE HIM IN WHAT THE EXIT AND ENTRANCE PULSE SHO IS THAT PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT THE CANDIDATE CARRYING BOUT PEOPLE LIKE THEM MATTERS THEY VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY FOR DONAL TRUMP THAT IS NUMBER ONE NUBER TWO DONALD TRUMP IS EXTREMELY LUCKY IN HIS OPPONENTS JOBIDON IS A DEAD MAN I MEAN IDON'T MEAN THAT HE'S LIKE PHYSICALLY DEAD ALTHOUGH HE KINDIDAES I MEAN THAT JOBIDON IS EI TERRIBLE PRESIDENT WHO HAPPENS TO BE RUNING AT THIRTY THREE PER CENT IN THE APPROVAL RATINGS AND THAT MEANS THAT ANY ONE INCLUDING SLICED BREAD LOOK S ELECTABLE AGAINS JOBIDE SO THE ENTIRE ARGUMENT AS BEING MADE BY DONALD TRUMPS OPPONENTS THAT HE WAS UNELECTABLE WHICH WAS PROBABLY TRUE IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE IS NO LONGER TRUE IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WHEN DONAL TRUMP IN NEARLY EVERY POLE IS LEADING JOBIDON THE ELECTABILITY ARGMENT COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED AND WITH THAT ARGUMENT WHEN MOST OF TE OPPOSITION TO DONAL TRUMP IN THE RE PUBLICAN PARTY SO DONALD TRUMP WAS BASICALLY IN CONTROL THE ISWELE COKASES BY THE PULING DATA BY ESSENTIALLY JUNE IF YOU LOOK ALLTHE WAY BACK AT THE BEGINNINGS OF PULLING IN THE ISWEL COXAS WILL GET MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE THAT'S ABOUT WHEN TO SANTO CENTERED THE RACE AND THAT WAS TO SANTIS HIGH WATERMARK AND IWA HEWAS A TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT AND TRUMPAS AT FORTY PER CENT AND DE SANTIS THEN PROCEEDED TO DROP ABOUT TEN PER CENT FROM ABOUT THIRTY PER CENT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT IN THE FINAL TALLY HERE TRUMP FOR HIS PART ROSE FROM ABOUT FORTY PER CENT TO ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT AND THT WAS BAKED INTO THE CAKE AS EARLY AS JU  AS JULY AS MID JULY DONAL TRUMPWAS ALREADY UP THIRTY POINTS ON THE FIELD AND THAT'S WHERE HE ENDED UP IN THIS RACE NICKEE HAYLEY PICKED UP SOME OF THE SUPPORT THAT EARLY ON MGHT HAVE BEEN GOING TO SWEM OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES THE CHRIS CHRISTIES OF THE WORLD FORT EXAMPLE AND SHE CANSOLIDATE ENOUGH SUPPORT TO FINISH A CLOSE THIRD TO RON TO SANTIS IN IWA BUT AGAIN THEY ARE SO FAR BEHIND THAT NONE OF THAT REALLY MATTERS ILLGET TO MORE ON THIS IN JUST ONE MOMENT FIRST IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT MATTERS MOST TO ME IN LIFE IT'S THOSE I LOVE WELL THANKS MY FRIENDS A PRETOCK THEY ARE BEATING TO DAYS IN PLATION THEN MAKING IT EASIER TO CONNECT WITH THOSE IM PORTANT PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE IF YOU'RE LIKE MA HERE'S NOT A DAY THAT GOES BY I DON'T CALL OR TEKE SOME ONE I CARE ABOUT YES BELIEVE O'RE NOT THERE ARE PEOPLE I CAREABOUT SURE THE 'LL SHIRE MY

QUESTION BECOMES WHAT COMES NEXT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN THE PRIMARIES WHELLIFYOU LOOK AT THE NEW HAMPSHIRE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY WHICH IS THE NEXT ONE UP TO SANTUS HAS EFFECTIVELY NO SUPPORT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IS NOT HIS STATE IT'S A VERY MODERATE STATE TENDS TO BE CAN AMIT ROMNESK KIND OF STATE WITH A LIBERTARIAN BEN WHICH DWI RON PAUL TENDED TA PER FORM OVER IN NEW HAMPSHIRE HISTORICALLY SPEAKING RIGHT NOW THE REAL COPOLITICS PULLING AVERAGE DONALL TRUMP HAS FORTY THREE POIN FIVE PER CENT NICKEE HALEIS AT TWENTY NINE POINT THREE PER CENT CHRIS CHRISTY WHOLL ONLY RECENTLY DROPPED OUT O THE RACE WAS PULLING ELEVEN TWELVE PER CENT TO SANTUS AS DOWN AT SEVEN AND ROMASUAMY WAS DOWN AT FIVE SO AS WILL DISCUSS IN A SECOND ROMASWAMMY IS NOW OUT OFFICIALLY N  HE WAS EFFECTIVELY OUT A FEW WEEKS TOGO BECAUSE AGAIN HIS PULLING DATO WE'RE NOT SUFFICIENT TO KEEP HIM GOLNG IN THE RACE THE ROMASUAMMY OFFICIALLY DROPPED OUT LAST NIGHT SO HIS FIVE PER CENT WILL GO TO TRUMP YOU'D IMAGION WHICH BRINGS TRUMP UP TO FORTY EIGHT POINT FIVE PER CENT THE SANTUSIS PER CENTAGE IS PROBALYCGAN REMAINS STABLE MAYBE AT DROPS A LITTLE BIT SO MAYBE THAT BOOST TRUMP ABOVE FIFTY PER CENT AND THEN CHRISTY'S PER CENTAGE POINTS ARE GOING TO GO TO HALEY SO YOU'D IMAGINE THT HALEY IS GOING O BE ABOUT FORTY PER CENT AND TRUM S GOING TO BE UP AROUND FIFTY PER CENT THOU BE MY PREDICTID FINAL RESULT IN NEW HAMPSER SPECIALLY GIVEN THE BLOW OUT VICTOR FOR DONALD TRUMP HERALL IF TRUMP WINDS IWANE WHO WINS NEW HAMPSHIRE HE'S NOT LOSING A PRIMARY THE RESC OF THE SEASON AND WE ARE NOW DONE AND EVERYBODY CAN KIND OF FEEL IT AN NICKEY HAILEY IF SHE'D REALLY WANTED TO HAVE A SERIOUS CHALLENGERE NEEDED TO COME IN SECONDS HERE BY COMING IN THIRD TWO TO SANTIS HRUMAMENTUM WAS SOMEWHAT BLUNTED THE SANTIS FOR HIS PART IS NOT FORMALLY  DROPPING OUT AT THIS POINT THE SANTUS IS NOT TROPING OUT BECAUSE PRESUMABLY HE IS THINKING THAT MAYBE SOMETHING WILD HAPPENS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE PERHAPS SOMETHING STRANGE HAPPENS IN SOUTH CAROLINA PERHAPS THERE'S A HEALTH PROBLEM WITH DONALD TRUMPER SOMETHING AND HE IS STILL SORT OF THE NEAREST COM PETITOR IN TURMS OF PEOPLE HORE STOL IN THE RAYS WHO MERA DONALD TRUMPS POLICY PREFERENCES THEN MAYOR MAY NOT BE TRUE BOTOLINE HEREIS AGAIN I DON'T SEE THE MATH THERE IS NO MATH FOR ANYONE ELSE TO WIN THIS NOMINATION EXCEPT FOR DONALD TRUMP NOTS WORTH EXPLORING HERE WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED IN IOWA AND THE BREAK DOWN OF THE NENAGRAPHICS IN IOWA NUMBER ONE NO ONE VOTED AGAIN THIS WAS BASICALLY TREATED LIKE AN INCUMBENT ELECTION IN TWO THOUSAND IN SIXTEEN THEREABOUT A HUNDREDAN EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO VOTED THE IO CAUCASES LAST NIGHT A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE PARTICIPATED THAT IS REALLY REALLY LOW UT' A VERY LOW NUMBER WHY BECAUSE EVERYBODY BASICALLY ASSUME THE DONAL TRUMP WAS GOING TO WIN AND THAT'S THEY WERE RIGHT OBVIOUSLY AS THE WALSTRY JOURNAL SAYS IN THE END THERE IS ONLY ONE LANE TO VICTORY AND IWA AND DONAL TRUMP HAD IT ALL TO HIMSELF THE CANDIDATE'S CHALLENGING THE FORMER PRESIDENT HAD HOPED TO FIND ENOUGH TO SATISFACTION WITH HIM TO BUILDTHERON VOTER COLITION NICKEY HALEY THE FORMER SOUTH CAROLINA GOVENOR HA TRON SIGNS IN POLLING OF CONSOLIDATING COLLEGE EDUCATED REPUBLICANS SUCH AS THOSE IN THE SUBURBS OR COLLEGE TOWNS VIOWA AS WELL AS VOTERS LESS COMMITTED TO CONSERVATIVE CAUSES RONDO SANTUS THE FLORTA GOVERNOR HAD MOVED AGGRESSIVELY TO WHIN VOTERS WHO FEAR A LIBERAL TAKE OVER OF SCHOOLS BUSINESS AS IN ACADEMIA BUT TRUMP CARRIED THOSE GROUPS WINNING SUM HANDILY HE WON THIRTY TWO PER CENTS OF COLLEGE GRADUATES TO NICKEY HALEY'S THIRTY PER CENT HE DOMINATED AMONG THOSE WITHOUT A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE DEGREE LOGE THE WALSTRY JORNAL EXIT POLLING WHAT YOU FIND IS AMONG THOSE WITH A COLLEGE DEGREE DONALD TRUMP ONE THIRTY FIVE PER CENT NIC GE HAILY ONE THIRTY ONE PER CENT IN THE RONOSANTUS ONE TWENTY TO PER CENT AMONG THOSE WITH NO COLLEGE DEGREE DONALD TRUMP ONE SIXTY THREE PER CENT OF THE VOT COMPARED TO THIRTEEN PER CENT FOR BOTH HALEY AND TO SANTUS THIS OF COURSE HAS BEEN TRUMPS PITCH SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN IS THE SORT OF IDEA OF A BROAD WORKING CLASS COLITION THA WAS GOING TO VOTE RE PUBLICAN AND LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO CREED AND ECONOMIC PHILOSOPHY ABOUT WY THAT IS I THINK TAT AS MUCH LESS TO DO WITHT ECONOMICS AND MUCH MORE TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT DONALD TRUMP OF ALL THE CANDIDATES IN AMERICAN HISTORE REALLY DOES NOT LOOK DOWN ON BLUE COLLAR WORKING PEOPLE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY DOES THIS IS WHY TEY'VE EMBRACED THE INTERSECTIONAL IDEOLOGY AND DONAL TRUM PROJECTS THAT HOLESAIL AND HE TENDS TO TOCOLIC A BLUE COLLA WORKING GOT EVEN THOUGH HE CLEARLY IS NM OT AND THAT TRANSLATE AMONG URBAN VOTERS DONALD TRUMP ONE FIFTY FOUR PER CENT SUBURBAN VOTERS WHICH BE WERE NICKEE HALEY WOULDO THE BEST HOU WONG THIRTYRSEVEN PER CENT COMPARE WITH NICKEE HALEYS TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT AND IN SMALL TOWNS RURAL AREAS HE DOMINATED AGAIN FIFTY NINE PER CENT FIFTY NINE PER CENT OF PEOPLE BY THE WAY WHO SAID THAT TRUMPS ROLE IN JANUAR SIX THE ZEALEGAL VOTED FOR NICKY HALEY BUT THAT IS NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE VERY FEW PEOPLE IN THE REPUBLICAN COLITION ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT WEN AGAT THESE ARE MIRRORED THOSE RESULTS FROM WALZTERGUNALL ARE MIRRORED IN THE WASHINGTON POST ENTRANCE POLES DONAL TRUMP DOMINATED PRETY MUCH EVERY GROUP THEREIS ONLY ONE GROUP THE DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T ACTUALLY WIN AND THT WAS VOTERS SEVENTEEN THROUGH TWENTY NINE AS BUT NINE PER CENT VOTERS IN IWA AMONG THAT GROUP RONDO SANTISSETU ONE THAT GROUP THIRTY PER CENT AGAIN MIRRORING WHAT HAPPENE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN UAL RE CALL THE TED CREWS ACTUALLY OUT PERFORMED AMONG YOUNG REPUBLICANS IT WAS OLDER BOOMER REPUBLICANS WHO TENDED VOTE VERY HEAVILY FOR DONALD TRUMP TAT WAS MIRRORED LAST NIGHT IN THE RESULTS ALL THOUGH DONALD TRUMP DID SWEEP EVERY AGE GROUP OUTSIDE OF THE SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY NINES SEVENTEEN IW TWENTY NINE DONAL TRUMP ACTUALY FINISHE THIRD IWEN TO SANTIS THIRTY HALEY TWENTY FIVE

CANDIDATES IN THIS RACE AND EARLIER TO NIGHT I CALLED DONAL TRUMP TO TELL HIM THAT I CONGRATULATEIM ON IS VICTORY AND NOW GOING FORWARD HE WILL HAVE MY FULL ENDORSEMENT FOR THE PRESIDENTS AND I THINK

MANTEL OVER THE GU OVER YOU DON'T PUT THE GUN OVER TE MANTEL UNLESS THE GUN IS GOING TO BE FIRED AN I'VE SAID THIS TO MY BUSINT PARTNER CHAIR ME BORRING MANY MANY TIMES CHEKOFF'S GUNS PRINCIPL IS NOT ACTUALLEY A AN IMPERATIVE IT'S DESCRIPTIVE MEANING THAT IS HOW THE HUMAN BRAIN WORKS THAT IS HOW PEOPLE ACT THEY ACT AS THOUGH IF THE THING IS THERE IT IS GOING TO BE USED THE IDEA THAT THERE WAS

NINETEEN SIXTY RAN FOR PRESSING HE LOST VERY NARROWLY JEFF KAY AND THE HE WENT OUT INTO THE WILDERNESS AND THN HE CAME BACK IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT INU ON A SWEEPING VICTORY AGAINST HUBERT HUMPHREY THAT LOOED ALOT CLOSER THAN IT ACTUALLY WAS IN THE END THIS IS THAT AND MEAN THIS IS WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE THE FACT THAT DONALD TRUMP ONE AND TWENTY SIXTEEN WAST FAIRLY NARROWLY IN THE ELECTROL COLLEGE IN IT TWENTY TWENTY AND NOW HAS COME BACK AND IT STUCK AROUND YOU REALLY NEVER WENT AWAY IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IS JUST ON ANY LEVEL IN AMAZING STORY AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DO LOVEAN AMAZING STORY AND

PULLING RIGHT NOW TRUMP VERSE IS BIDON TRUMP IN THE BETTING AVERAGES IS WAY AHEAD OF JOBIDON AT THIS POINT WHEN A COMES TO  JGENERAL ELECTION MATCHUPS RIGHT NOW TRUMP HAS ABOUT ONE POINT ONE PER CENTSAGE POINT LEAT AGAINST JOBIDON WITH REGARD TO THE THE WITH RERAUD E THE REAL COPOTIC POLL AVERAGE KE IS AHEAD ACCORIG TORASKUSON REPORTS BY EIGHT HE'S AD A CORING SEBES NEWS BY TWO AND THESE ARE ALL IN HTHE TE SEBES NEWS POLE IS WITHIN THE MARTION OF EROR WBU RASKUSON IS WAY OUTSIDE THE MARTION OF EAROR ECONIMIST YOU GOV HAS THEM TIED OF FORTY THREE WRITERS IPSOS HAS THEM TIDE AT FORTY EIGHT MORNING CONSULT HAS BIDON AT FORTY THREE AND TRUMP AT FORTY TWO SO AT THE VERY LEAST THIS A DEAD HEAT OR TRUMP IS AHEAD THAT IS WHERE THING STANDIN WHN YOU LOOK AT THE STATE BY STATE WHEN YOU LOO AT THE STATE BY STATE POLLING DATA WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT DONALD TRUMP IS INCREDIBLY COMPETITIVE IN ALL OF THE STATE THE LATEST PULLING OUT OF MICHIGAN HAS DONALD TRUMP UP IN THE REAL COPOLITICS POLLING AVERAGE FIVE POIN THREE PER CENT INCLUDING A POLE FRUM THAT IS RIGHT NEWS WITH TRUMP UP EIGHT IF TRUMPLIN'S MICHIGAN HE'S GOING TOWIN THE ELECTION IN PENNSYLVANIA IT'S BASICALLY DEAD EVEN AND BY THE WAY ONE OF THE REASONS IS DEAD EVEN IS BECAUSE JOSHI PERO THE EMOCRATIC GOVERNOR IS POSING HIS MODERATE SAMETHING WITH JOHN FEDDERMIN THE SENATOR BUT IF THE MOOD OF THE COUNTRY IS PRO TRUMP HE'S ON WHIN PENNSYLVANIA IF YOU TAKE A LOOK THAT WISTCONSON THE POLES THERE ARE TIED BUT THE LATEST ONE FROM BLOOMBURG MORNING CONSULT HAS TRUMP UP FOR IN WISTCONSIN AND TO TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER BATTLE GROUND STATES THE TRUMP LOST LAST TIME HE'S WAY AHEAD IF YOU LOOK AT AERIZONA HE HAS HAD VERY SOLIDLY IF YOU'LOK A GEORGIA HE'S AHEAD VERY SOLIDLY SO THE PULLING FACTOR TRUMP IS AHEAD WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ACTURAL FACTORS IN THE CAMPAIGN TRUMP IS ALSO AHEAD WHY JOBIDON CAN'T TALK THE FACT THAT JOBIDON CAN'T TALK THE FACT THAT JOBIDON IS TEN RUN A BASEMENT CAMPAIGN WALL HE IS PRESIDENT IS A SERIOUS PROBEM FOR HIM RUNNING THE BASEMENT CAMPAIGN WHEN THE OTHER GUY IS PRESIDENT IS ACTUALLY THE RIGHT STRATEGY BECUSE YEU WANT THE FOCUS ON THE OTHER GUY IRONICALLY DONAL TRUMP IS LIKELY TO RUN WHAT WILL AMOUNT TO BASEMENT CAMPAIGN BECAUSE THERE WILL BE NO TOBATE BUIDIN IS NOTGOING TO BATE TRUMP IT'S NOT CIN A HAPPEN FOR EVERYBODY WHO'S LIKE HOT AND BOTHERED ABOUT THAT IT AN'T COAN A HAPPEN BIDN IS NOT GETING ON STATE WITH DONAL TRUMP BEYOND THAT DONALD TRUMP DID SOMETHING IRONICALY IS THING ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY I VISITED THE WHITE HOUSE IN JANUARY T OF TWENTY ATIN AND I'S TALKING WITH A VERY VERY HIGH RANKING MEMBER OF THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF OF TRUMPSTAFF AND THEY SAID WHAT SHOULD WE DO AND I SAID HEU SHOULD BUILD A FAKE TWITTER AP ANDYEU SHOULD PUT IT ON TRUMP'S PHONE AND IT SHOULD LAT TRUMP TWEAT INTO THE AP AND HE WOULD GET BACK A MUNCH OF WARM MESSAGES AND HE WOULD BE SUPERHAPPY ON THE INSIDE AND NO ONE ELSE WOULD EVER SEE WHAT EXACTLY HE WAS TWEATING AND THEN IRONICALLY THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED HE GOT BAND FROM TWITTER AND HE CREATED TRUTH SOCIAL AND HE'S STILL ON TRUTH SOCIAL AND HIS EXPOSURE ON TROUTH SOCIAL IS LIKE ONE ONE THOUSAND OF WHAT IT WOULD BE IF YEU ARE ON EXT RIGHT NOW SO I RONICALLY HE ACTUALLY IS DOING THE THING THAT IS LIKELY TO MAKE HIM SUCCESSFUL BY ACCIDENT DONALD TRUMPS CAN GO OUT THERE'S GIN TO DO RALLIES HE'LL DO OCCASIONAL INTERVIEWS AND MEANWHILE THE CENTERE OF FOCUS RIGHT NOW WILL BE ON THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS VERY DIFFICULT TO AVOID BEING THE TENTRO FOCUS AND ALL THE INDICTMENT TALK NI KNOW THE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE INDICTMENTS COMING T THIS YEAR BUT MANY OF THE FACTORS OF ALREADY SHIFTED IN THOSE INDICTMENTS SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE FANNY WILLIS REKO CASE IN GEORGIA THE STORY THERE IS SHIFTING BECAUSE A LEGEDLY FANNY WILLIS WAS BASICALLY USING THAT CASE TO PAY HER BOY FRIENDS THAT COULD TAKE CRUISES AROUND THE WORLD TOGETHER SHE MAN UP IN JAIL ALLEGEDLY OVER WHAT SHE WAS DOING IN THAT CASE THE ALVAN BRAG CASE IN MANHATTON THATLOKS LIKE THAT IS GOING NOWHERE FAST EVEN IF TRUMP WERE TO BE CONVICT IN THAT CASE NO ONE IS GOING TO THINK HAT THAT IS LEGIN MATE CASE THE JACK SMITH CASE IN WASHINGTON D C IS THAT EVEN TO COME TO TRIAL BEFORE THE ELECTION OR THE FLOORITA CLASSFI DOCUMENTS CASE IS DACKING TO COME TO TRIAL DEMICRAFTS PEOPLE WHO ARE USING LEGAL MANEUVERING AGAINST TRUMP TO GET HIM OFF THE BALLET I AM NOT SURE THAT THAT ACTUALLY IS HURTING TRUMP BECAUSE THEY WENT OVER KOL IF IT WERE ONE TRUCK LET'S HEY WERE ONLY THE JACK SMITH WASHINGTON D C CHARGES ALL FOCUS WOULD BE ON THAT TRIAL THE PROBLEMIS WHEN USE A SHOCK INLEGAL APPROACH WITH TRUMP IT LOOKS LIKE AN OVERWHELMING TO NOMY LEGAL ASSAULT ON TRUMP WHICH IT IS IS ANY OF THAT CAN A HERT DONAL TRUMPERS AT LL BAKTED IN TO THE CAKE OF THIS POINT MEANWHILE HE GOT A PRESIDENT WHO LITERALLY CANNOT TALK HERE WAS JOBINE YESTERDAY HE'S HOLDING UP A BAG OF APPLES AND SMILING WEARILY MAN O THE FEEL BAD FOR THE GUY HE'S ISJUS NOW WITH IT HE'S ASKING SOME MAY HOLD ARE YOU CS ELEVNIS 'S WA WELLLI SRAN A THE GROCERY IN  O MAGANUS I MAKE HE CAN BARELY MOVE I'M AN IT JUST IT'S HE THIS IS WHAT IT IS O CATE JOBIDAN IS NOT  WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HIM AS A CANDIDATE I MEAN THATKI SHOULD NOT HAVE A LICENCE TO DRIVE THAT'S THAT THAT'S WHERE WE ARE IN THIS RASE RIGHT NOW AND MEANWHILE HIS BACK L P COMEL HARRISON SOMEHOW EVEN WORSE OF THIS HERE IS COMELA HARRIS YESTERDAY TRYING TO GENUP ENTHUSIASM I MEAN I SWEAR TO GOD SHE MAY BE A IN ACTUAL SHE MAY BE THE FIRST A I HUMAN SHE SHE'S ABSOLUTELY AN INHABITANT OF THE UNCANNY VALLEY SHE'S SET UP HOUSING IN THE UNCANNY VALLEY WITH ELECTRICITY AND PLUMMING BECAUSE SHE SHE'S LIKE IF SHE WERE TO EVER BECOME PRESIDENTS OF TE UNITED STATES THEY WOULDN'T NEED TO BUILD AN ANIMATRONIC OF HER AT WALL DISNEY'S HOLL PRESIDENTS THEY WOULD JUST IMPORT HER HERE HERE SHE IS YESTERD A PANCOD SHES IT SHE'S SHE'S UNWATCHABLE SHE'S UNWATCHABLE I THE AR C  AN LEME TO TAY  LOVTIN THE ADAA  THO GA FOR THE ELDER A DA I GO VA HUMBLIN THE UM ABOUT THE HERE WITH YOU IF SOM ONE OF EIGHTYEAS O TE DAY THEY WERE GOING IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE O WO WOW SO YETHET THAT THIS IS THIS IS YOUR VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDAT WHO WILL BE PRESIDENT BY THE WAY BECAUSE YOUR BITEN AN NOCKIN A LAST ANOTHER FOUR YEARS IN THIS OFFICE ELL ALL THIS IS LEAVING PEEPLE WHO OPPOSE TRUMP WITH VERY FEW OPTIONS AND THAT'S WHY THINGS ARE LIKELY TO GET VERY SCARY AND SPICY THIS YEAR I'M PRETTY MUCH EVERY FRUNT BT FOLKS THIS YEAR IS GOING TO BE ONE FOR THE HISTORY BOOKS NO ONE CAN ACTUALLY PREDICTS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN MEAN THERE WILL BE AN ELECTION THIS YEAR SOMEBODY'S GOING TO WIN BUT COULD BE ACTUAL WARFOBON WAR IN CHYNI THE MIDDLE EAST DON'T MIS OUT ON A MINUTE OF THE COVERS FROM THE VOICES YOU CONTRUST DOWNLOAD THE FREE DAILY WIRE PLUS AP RIGHT NOW KEEP UP WITH ALL THE LATEST TO GET ALL THE SHOWS UP TO THEMN IT NEWS COVERAGE AND A WHOLEHOST OF ENTERTAINMENT WHEN YOU EED LITTLE BREAK DON'T WAIT  DOWNLO DAILYWIRE PLUS RIGHT NOW OK CAM MEANWHILE SO WITH DONAL TRUMP AS THE PRESUMPT OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR NOMINE AND TROBIDIN AILING AND COMMALA HARRIS BEING THE BACK UP WOO WAS THAT A STANKER OF AR DECISION BY JOBID THE PANIC HAS SET IN ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF THE ALLEC FULL SCALE PANIC AND THIS BY THE WAYS ALSO AN ALLY OF TRUMP BECAUSE THE MORE YOU KEEP TELLING US THAT TRUMP IS MUSELINI THAT HE'S HITLER THAT THE WORLD'S CAN END IF YOU ELECTED PRESIDENT THE MORE EVERYBODY LOOKS AT YOU LIKE YOUR CRAZY BECAUSE YE ARE HERE IS THE THING NO MATTER WHAT YOU THNG I DOAL TRUMP THE NOTION THAT DONAL TRUMP IS IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS STALLIN HITLER MUSELINI IS AN ABSURDITY HOS ALREADY PRESIDENT ONCE AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED SOME TAX CUTS SOME SUPREME QUORT APPOINTMENTS PRETTY GOD FORN POLICY A GOOD ECONOMY SOME BAD GOVERNANTS DURING COVID AND THEN HE SET A BUNCH OF DUM STUFF BETWEEN NOVEMBER FOURTH AND JANUARY SIXTH AND A FEW HUNDRED PEOPLE WALKED IN TO THE CAPITAL BUILDING SOME OF WHOM ARE RIDINGS OM WHO JUST WALKED IN AD THAT WITHIN THREE HOURS THEY WERE CLEARED ANDTHEN HE WASN'T PRESEDENT ANY MORE THAT'S THE STORY IS THAT SOUNDLIKE MUSULINI OR HITLER TO YOU WITH IT THE MARCH UNROME WAS THAT HITLER'S RASTAG FIRE LIKE WHAT WHAT IT WHAT IS THAT WHERE IS THE COMP I NEED THE COMP IN ORDER TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE CLAIM THAT YOU ARE MAKING BY THE WAY APPOINT THAT I'VE BEN MAKING RECENTLY TO SOME OF MY DEMOCRATIC FRIENDS WHO HER SAYING TH WELL IF DONAL TRUMPLE TO WIN IT WOULD END DEMOCRACY THERE' BE NO MORE ELECTIONS QUICK POINT FOR YOU WHEN O WORDER DONAL TRUMP WILL HAVE SERVED TWO TERMS THAT POINT WHO NO LONGER BE ELGIBLE FOR PRESIDENT HE WILL NOT BE ELLOWED TO BE UN BALLAES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES SO ACTUALLY IF YOU WANT DONAL TRUMP NOT TO SCREW THE ELECTIONS ANY MORE NEUTHING HE'S REALLY GON A SCRO THE ELECTIONS YOU OUGHT TOBOE FOR DONALTRUMP AND THEN HE'LL BE IN FOR ANOTHER TERM AND THEN E'LLBE DONE AND H HE'LL GO ROUND TALKING BOUT Y ONE THREETERMS IS PRESIDENT ALL THE RES OF IT IN ANY CASE RACHELL MAN OUT WAS LEADINGIT OFF THEY'R TURNING UP TO SPINAL TAP ELEVEN GUISES HERE'S THE THING WHEN YOU KEEP TURNING THE VOLUME ALL THE WAY UP EVERYONE GOES DEAF AND YOU SPENT NINE YEARS WITH THE VOLUME AT PINAL TAB ELEVEN NO ONE HAS COKLY AT ANY MORE WE CAN'T HEAR YOU BECAUSE YOU'LL WENT NUTS TOO MANY TIMES TOO OFTEN BIG PICTURE TAKE AWAY FROM THAT AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE AGAIN TOO DARK AS HEU SAID ON THIS BUT IT IS NOT IF WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE RISE OF AUTHORITARIANISM AND THIS COUNTRY ARE WORRIED ABOUT POTENTIAL RIS A FACHISEM IN THIS COUNTRY WHO WORRIED ABOUT OUR DEMOCRACY FALLING TO AN AUTHORITARIAN AND POTENTIALLY FACIOUST FARM OF GOVERNMENT THE LEADER WHO IS TRYING TO DO THAT IS PART OF THAT EQUATION BUT PEOPLE WANTING THAT ORI SAY TOT UNGEAKER PART OF THAT ETTRASTION AND THE AMERICAN OLECTOR IT IS MADE UP OF TWO MATOR PARTIES ONE OF THOSE PARTIES HAS BEEN FLIRTING WITH EXTREMISM ON THE ULTRA RIHT FOR A VERY LONG TIME THEY'VE BROUGHT THE MEN IN A WAY BHUT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN CENTRAL TO REPUBLICAN ELECTORA POLITICS EVER BEFORE AND I KNOW BECAUSE I'VE BEEN STUDYING THIS BUT ONCE YOU HAVE ROTA CALLISE ONE MAJOR PARTIE SO THAT THOSE ARE THE PREFERENCES OF THE PEOPLE WHO ADHERE TO YOUR PARTY THE LEADERS INTARE CHANGEABLE AND YES TRUMPETSOM IS SOMETIMES WHAT WE CALL IT  MAGA MOVEMENTS PROBABLY BETTER WAY TO DO IT BUT THERE ISN'T A FORITARIAN MOVEMENT IN THAAV REPUBLICAN POLITICS THAT ISN'T BEING BEM BOOZLE BY TRUP THEY ARE PUSHING TROTEAT MORE AND MORE EXTREME BECAUSE THE MORE EXTREME THINGS HE SAYS THEN WHAT THEY MORE THEY  AND THAT IS COMING FROM A VERY LARGE PROPORTION OF THE AMERICAN RIGHT THAT ATHEARS TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NOT'S WHY THIS IS A REPUBLICAN PARTY PROBLEM WORE THAT IT IS THE PROBLEM OF ONE MAN AND HIS ANDIET BYWAY NOTISE WHAT SHE'S DOING HERE SHE'S NOT SHAING THAT DONAL TRUMPS VASHES SHE SANT YOURE AFASHES IF YOU VOTED FOR DONAL TRUMP OR WOOD WOULD FRENON TRUMP AGAINST JOBIDON BECAUSE LET'S SAV FOR EXAMPLE AN ANALAGY THAT I'VE BEEN USING RECENTLYS REGARDED DONAL TRUMP THE CHECKS AND BALANCES OF THE OFFISE PREVENT HIM FROM DOING MANY OF THE THINGS THET MAYBE EVEN HAS AN INCLINATION TO DO THE CHECKS IN THE BALANCEIS AND BEN WORKING ASTUALLY LESS WELL WITH JOBIDON DONAL TRUMP SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH PROFESSIONALS THOSE PROVESSIONALS VERY OFTEN TOLD HIM DON'T DO THIS THING IT'S  ILLEGAL THAT HAPPENED A LOT DURING DRODURING DONAL TRUMPS ADMINISTRATION JOBIDON DOES THE LEGAL THINGS ON THE REGULAR AND HI'S PEOPLE ARE LIKE EAL CALL DO IT SO WHEN YOU ASSESS THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ONE OFTHE THINGS THAT WE ALL DO WE ALL DO THIS IS WE ASSUME THAT THERE IS A FILTER THAT FILTER IS THE FILTER OF GOVERNAN'S REALITY IT'S A GOOD COFFEE FILTER S HE POUR THE WATER ON THE COFFEE GROUNDS AND THE FILTER PREVENTS THE ACTUAL COFFEE GROUNDS FROM GETTING IN YOUR COFFEE A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT TRUMP SAYS IS THE COFFEE GROUNDS AND A LOT OF THE WORST STUFF DOESN'T GET THROUGH THE COFFEE FILTER WITH JOBIDIN THE GRAINS ARE TOO SMALL THET YO FIND THEY GET RIGHT THROUGH THE COFFEE FILTER AND SO HE GET ON THE OTHER END IS ACT YO WORST COFFEE WITH JOBIDON THEN OE WOULD AE DONAL TRUMP THAT IS THE CASE TO  MADE BUT THE OMICRAS ARE AREADY TURNING IT UP TO IT'S NOTTHUS TRUMPIT'S EVERYONE IF YOU VOTE FOR TRUMP AGAINST JOBIDANS BECAUSE YOU'REN OLF THORITARIAN WANTABY YOU WANT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WEAPONIZED AGAINST YOU NOW PART F THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THE ONLY CANDIDATE IN THIS RATE WHO'S ACTIVELY WEAPONIZE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGAINST IT CITIZENS IS JOBIDON IT IS JOBID WHO TRIED TO USE THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION OSHA ANADMINISTRATEOF AGENCY TO CRAM DOWN OF ACTING ON EIGHTY MILLION PEOPLE AND WE HERE AT THE DAILY WIRE WE SUED HIM TO STOP THAT FROM HAPPENIN IT IS JOBIDON WHOS SUGGESTED HE CAN UNALATERALLY NOT IN FORSE IMIGRATION LAW CHANGE ALL OUR EMIGRATION LAWS AND LET FIVE SIX SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE INTO THE COUNTRY LEGALLY THAT'S JOBIDON WHO'S DOING THAT SO ALL OF YOUR TALK OF DONAL TRUMPING A THREATS THE COUNTRY WE CAN ALL SEE WHAT'S HAPPENIG HERE WE CAN ALL SEE IT IT'S NOTJUS RACHEL MAT OUTS OF COURSE JOY RAD ON THAT SAME TERRIBLE PANAL MEN AMA S EN B C THE LEVEL OF IDEOLOGICAL DIVERSITY THERE RANGING ALL THE WAVE FROM TEN SHOCKY ON THE RIGHT TO RACHEL MATO AND JOY READ ON LEFT IS PRETTY ASTONISHMING AN I DINT HAEN WETIN I MA TEA MI IT THIT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM SHE'S FILLA BROWN LADY THAT'S GOT TO TRY TO WIN IN A PARTY THAT IS TITE ANTE EMMIGRANT AND WICH EXFENT THE NOTION THAT IU CAN FAY EMMIGRANTS OR POITENING THE BLOOD OF OUR COUNTRY SH'S GETTING IN O BIRTHARD  BY DONALD TRUM OH AN I DON'T EAR HOW MUCH THE DOT A RADA LIE TEDERO TO GRAP UP A LOT THE BETTER SIN DOES THEN U AFTIR SO IT FILL A TALEN I DON'T SEE HOW SHEN BECOMES THE NOMINY OF THAT PARTY WITH DONALD TRUMP TILL AROUND I CAN'T FICSURE IT THAPPENIN MAY BE CAN APPEN LON TO TANTIS IS ONLY ARGUMENT FOR STHING IN IT IF HE' THE LIKE I THIT HE CANS TIL MAK THE APPEAL TOWITY BOG AND IT IS JUST AMAZING TO WATCH THE LEFT TALK ABOUT HOW ALL OF THE VOTER FOR DONAL TRUMPER ACTUALLY JUST RACIST AGAINST NICKEY HALY BY THE WAY IF NICKEY HALOER THE NOMINY THEY BE SAING ALVIS HIM CRAPABOUT NICKY HALEBS THIS WHAT THEY DO MEANWHILE DAVID FRENCH AGAIN SOMEBODY I CAN SIDER A FRIEND BUT DAVID IS SO WILDLY OFF THE RESURBATION ON THIS PARTICULAR SO DAVID IS NOW CALLING I KNOW I'S ANTA TRUMP IS BENANTI TRUMPSONCE TWENTY SIXTEN AN THAN HE REMAIN ANTI TRUMPAN NOW HE RITES FOR THN YOUR TIME'S BEING ANTI TRUMP YOU LITERALLY PUT OUT A PIECE YESTERDAY AS DONALD TRUMP IS EMERGING VICTORIAS FROM THE IVAL CACCASES CALLED JIST QUALIFIED TRUMP OR ELSE SO THE IDEA HERE WOULD BE TH THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE AMERICA IS TO LITERALLY TAKE DONALD TRUMP OFF THE BALLET IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR YOU WANT ACTURAL ARMED CONFLICT THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO BRING ACTURAL ARMED CONFLICT IS TO KICK DONALD TRUMP OFF THE BALLET ENTIRELY ACCORDING TO DAVID FRENC THERE'S NO DOUBT NOTKANG TRUMP OFF THE BALLT WOULD TEN SHOCK WAVES THROUGH THE AMERICAN BODY POLITIC BUT WHY WOULD ANY ONE BELIEVE THAT I'S INHERENTLY LESTY STABLIZING IF TRUMP RUNS WE ALREADY KNOWHAT HE DOES WHEN HE LOSES FOR HIM COUNTING THE VOTES IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF THE BATTLE IF HE LOSES HE'LL CHALLENGE THE RESULTS CONSPIRE TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION AND INSIHE POLITICAL VIOLANS I'LL GO HAVE A QUESTION HOW LITTERALLY HOW HEWAS PRESIDENT LAST TIME AND HE STILL COULDN'T DO IT WHERE CAN N ETHE MECHANISMS FOR WHICH DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT HOW IS THAT GOING TO HAPPEN OUTLICK I WANT PEOPLE AT SOME POINT THEY SAIY WILD THINGS LIKE THERE WILL BE AN ARMED UPRISING O'LL GETLIC AT'S ONE TO NOW SPELL IT OUT LIKE STEP BY STEP HOW DO WE GET FROM POINT A TO POINT B OR REJUST SAYING THINGS NOW HE SAYS IF HEU WINS YOUHAVENAN INSURRECTIONIST AN COMMAND OF TH MOST POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE WORLD WHOSE TELL BENT ON SEEKING VENGEANCE ON HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES DOES ANYTHING AT ALL SOUND STABILIZING ABOUT THAT AGAIN YOU THINK THE DONAL TRUMP I'S GOING TO I UNDERSTAND EVERYBODY IS VERY HOT AN BUT DONAL TRUMPS CON A PROSCUTAT NOW HE'S NOT I'M JUST TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW HE'S NOT GOING TO O' GELIC IF HE DOES LUT'S POS BAL BE EXTREMELY SHOCKED BECAUEHE SAID THE SAME THING ABE HELLERCLIN AND THEN HE DIDN'T YOU US CAN TO HAPPEN IF YHEU WINS HE'S TOM WE SUPERHAPPY IN IS CAN BE IN THE WHITE HOUSE ALL DAY DON WENEE IT BEFORE TWEETING AND LET IS AIDES MAKE GOOD POLICY THAT'S WHAT'S ACTULLY GAN O HAPPEN BUT BUT DAVID FRENCH IS NOW MAKING THE CASE THAT WE NEED TO TAKE TRUMP OFF THE BALLAT TO SAVE THE REPUBLIC YOU ON'T GET TRUMPELECTED THERE'S PRETTY MUCH NO BETTER WAY TO DO IT THAN SAY STUFF LIKE THIS IA GAIN THE REASON THE PANNIC IS SETTING IN IS BECAUSE JOBIN'S POLICY IS COMING CLEAR TO EVERY ONE HERE IS THE BIGGEST PROBEM BY THEWAY FOR THE WORLD MY PREDICTION SAID YESTERDAY I'M A CONTINUE SAYING IT IF WE GETS A JUNEGILI AUGUST AND DONAL TRUMPS UP INTHE POLES THE CHANCES THE CHINA BLOCKADES SI WAN ARE EXTREMELY HIGH THEY GO FROM LIKE THIRTY PER CENT TO DAY TO PROBABLY SIXTY PER CENT WHY BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT ON'L TRUM TO BE PRESIDENT WHEN THEY BLOCKATES I WAN THEY FIGURE THAT JOBIDON IF THERE'S BLOCKADE OF TIWAN WILL PRESSURE TI WAN TO MAKE SOME SORT OF DEAL WITH CHINA TO STOP THE CONFLICT AND GIVE THEM SOME SOPHISTICATED MIKROSHIPS IN ORDER TO PREVENT HIM FROM LOSING THE REELECT EFFORT SEE IN AN ELECTION HERE THE INCOMENT PRESIDENT IS VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO FOREIGN CONFLICT THIS IS WHY AND TWENTY TWELVE YOU'LL RECALL IN AN ACT OF COLOGEN WITH THE RUSSIANS YOU REMEMBER THE BRAKLAMA ACTUALLY SAT WITH DMETRY MEDVIDEV WHO IS THEN THE PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA WHO SORT OF STANDIN WHO'S CUT OUT FOR VLANERPOUDENT AND HE SAID TELL LADIMER I'LL HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY AFTER THE ELECTION IN OTHER WORDS PLEASE DON'T DO ANYTHING BAD THAT WOULDHURT MY REELECT TOPES AND THEN I WILL HELP YOU GUISE AFTER THE ELECTION WHICH HEY DID WHEN RUSSIA ACTUALLY TOOK CONTROL OF BOTHSERIA AS WELL AS CRIMIA AT BOT THE SAME THING IS VERY MUCH IAVAILABLE THIS YEAR FOR AMERICA'S ENEMIES THIS IS TA YEAR TO GO MAN THISIS A YEAR TO PUT PRESSURE ON JOBIDON THIS IS A YEAR WHERE IF YOU CAN CREATE CONFLICT YOU BELIEVE THET JOBIDON WILL SIMPLY GIVE YOU A COOKY TO MAKE YOU GO AWAY THAT'S TRUE FOR CHINA IT'S TRUE FOR A RON SO REMEMBER OVER THE WEEKEN THE UNITED STATES AS WELL AS SOME OF IT'S ALLIES LAUNCHED A SERIES OF MISSILE A TACKS ON THE WHO THES IN YEMMON ON I SAY THE WHO TESE I MEANS TO MEMPT YOU BUILDINGS THAT THE WHO THES RUN AND OWN BUT THEY GIVELIC A WEEK OF WARNINGS TO NOBODY WAS AFTRYOU THERE A GRAND TOTAL ITHING SIX WHO THESE KILLED IN THIS MASSIVELY EXPENSIVE AIR STRIKE BY THE AMERICANS AND OUR ALLIES DID THAT PUT OFF TO WHO THES OF COURSE I DIDN' PUTOFF THE WHO THES WHY WOULD IT ALL THE WHO THES HAVE TO DO IS SURVIVE AND POKE AT THE UNITED STATES TO CLAIN VICTORYES THIS IS THE BAZAR MAFT OF THE MIDDAELEAST TE UNITED STATES ISRAEL WESTERN COUNTRYES ARE EXPECTED TO COMPLETELY DEVASTATE THE OPPOSITIO N COMPLETELY DEVISTATE THEM AND ALL THE BADGIS HAVE TO DO IS POPPED THEIR HEAD UP AFTER THE ENTIRE CITY AS LAID WISSINGL I'M STILL ALIVE YOU DIDN'T GET MA A SETS WOR THE HOOTHES ARE DOING RIGHT NOW SO ACCORDING TO THE GUARDIAN THE ARON BACKS WHOTHE MOLISHA GROUP HAS CONTINUED TO ATTACK COMMERCIAL SHIPPING HITTING AN AMERICAN OWN CARGOSHIP ITH THE BULLISTIC MISSIL IN DEFINES WILL WAVE OF UUS AND UCASE STRIKES ON YEMMON THE STRIKE AGAINST THE MARTIAL ISLANDS FLAGG TUBRALTER EAGL CONTAINERSHIP REPRESENTIG A TWIDENING OF THE THEATR OF WAR BEYON THE REDSA TO THE GULF OF ADEN THE STRIKE HAT THE CARGO HOLD O THE SHIP WHILE HIS THOUGHTS O AVE CASNO MATOR DAMAGEWIL ADSEFEERS THEY UC AND UC AND YUOUT STRIKES ON WHO THE TARGE TONYEMON HAVE NOT DEGRATED THE HOTHESE ABILITIES TO THREATEN COMMERCIAL SHIPPING CATAR BECAME THE LATEST MAJOR USER OF CARGOSHIPS TO ANNOUNCE IT WILL NOT SEND LIQUID GAS THROUGH THE RED SEA FOR THE FOR SEOPBLE FUTURE SO EVERYTHINGS CAN GET MORE EXPENSIVE AND THE HOPE ON THE PART OF THESE HOOTHY GROUPS AND THE ARANIANS IS THAT THE UNITED STATES WILL THEN PRESSER ISRAEL INTO STOPPING THE DESTRUCTION OF COMMAS IN ORDER TO REOPEN THE SHIPPING LANES THE BASILY THEY WILL CONCEEDE TO THE RAG TAG PIRATES AND JOBIDON MAY WELL DO THAT BECAUSE T AGAIN JOBIDON IS OF THE WEIRD OPINION THAT IN THE MIDDLE EAST CONCESSIONS GET YOU WHAT YOU WANT IN REALITY IN TH MIDLELEAST CONCESSIONS GENERALLY GET YOU KILLED AND THAT IS WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN OVER THEIR SENT COM PUT OUT A STATEMENT ON THIS YESTERDAY THEY SAID QUOTE ON GANUARY FIFTEEN THAT APPROXIMATELY FOUR PIAM SONAA TIME WHICH IS EMMON ARONIAN BACKD WHOTHE MILITONS FIRED N ANTISHIP BULLISTIC MISSILE FROM WHOTHE CONTROLLE T AREAS OF AMAN AN STRUCK THE GIBRALTAR EAGAL A MARTIAL ISLANS FLAGGD UUS OWN AN OPERATED CONTAINERSHIP THE SHIP HAS REPORTED NO INJURIES ARE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE IN IS CONTINUE ITS JERNING EARLIER IN THE DAY AT A PROXIMATELY SHUPIAM S FORCES DETECTED IN ANTISHIP BULLISTIC MISSILE FIRED TOWARD THE SOUTHERN REDSE COMMERCIAL SHIPPING LANES THE MISSIL FAILED AN FLIGHT AND IMPACKTED ON LAND IN YEMMON THEREWERE NO INJURIES OR DAMAGE REPORTED MEANWHILE THE ARANIANS UPING THEIR GAME THEY A STRUCK IN ARIA NEAR WHAT THEY CLAIMED WAS A UAS PASE IN AROCK IN ERBIL ACCORDING TO A BCNEW SEVERAL EXPLOSIONS ARE REPORTED NEAR THE OS CONSULET IN AIRBALE AROCK THE RNIAN REVOLUTIONARY GARDCOURT DIRECTLY TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACKS THEY SAID THEY WERE TARGNING THE QUAT HEADQUARTER OF SPIES AND ANTIRONIAN TERRIST GATHERINGS IN PARTS OF THE REGION THE CORDISTAN REGIONAL SECURITY COUNCILS HAD FOUR PEOPLE WEREKILLED IN SIX INJURED IN THE ATTACK SO AGAIN THIS ISARON DIRECTLY TAKING A HAND IN A ROCK NOT A SHOCK THEY'VEBEEN ACTIVE IN ROCK FOR VERY LONG TIME HERE SOMMIT A SOMVIDIO OF WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE TTHECAN SEM THE MISSILES HITTING OVER THERE SO ARON BY THE WAY ANDTHAT UP ATTACKING CIVILIANS AS WELL THE ARONIAN BULLISTIC MISSILE STRIKE ACTUALLY KILLED A PROMINENT BUSINESS MEN IN ROCKY CURTISTAN ACCORDING TO FORBES THE TARGET WAS NOT AS INITIALLY SPECULATED THE LARGE UUS CONSULATE OVER THERE OR THE AMERICAN TRUTH BASE IN AIRBILL INTERNATIONAL AIRBOR AIRPORT INSTEAD THE ACTUALLY DECIDE THEY'REGING TO HIT A WELL KNOWN LOCAL BUSINESS MEN KILLING HAM AND MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY THEY CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEATTACKED TO THE ARONIANS DIRECTLY AS

THE EMPIRE WORLD WHICH IS A CENTRAEL BUSINESS DISTRICT KNOWN FOR A HIGHRISE A PARTMENT BUILDINGS SO BASELY THEY'RE USING WHAT'S GOING ON THE MIDLIES AS AN EXCUSE TO HIT SOME OF THEIR ENEMIES IN CURTESTAM ESSENTIALLY SO IS T AR THINGS GETTING LESS CRAZY IN TEMIDALEAST NO BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THO WHEN THE UNITED STATES LESY VACUUM AROUND TENTS TO FILL THAT VACUUM MEANWHILE COMMOS CONTINUES ALONG IT'S MERRY WAY SO LAST NIGHT COMMSS FIRED FIFTY SEPARAT ROCKETS INTO ISRAEL PROPER AGAIN THIS WORDS BEEN GOING ON FOR OVER A HUNDRED DAYS AND TOM THEY ARE STILL FIRING ROCKETS FROM THE CENTER OF

PREMIUM SUBSCRIBER IS FOR YOU SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO LET'S GET TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS THE FIRST QUESTION IS ABOUT TASKS SQUITCHING AND THE SPECIFIC QUESTION IS IS THERE A WAY TO GET BETTER AT TASK SQUITCHING WELL TASK SWITCHING IS AN INCREDIBLY INTERESTING TOPIC IT'S SOMETHING THAT PLAGUES MANY PEOPLE THAT IS A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE CHALLENGES WITH TAST SWITCHING IT'S ALSO A TOPIC THAT PEOPLE WILL OFTEN CONFUSE WITH COGNIVE FLEXIBILITY SO ALL OF US WELL UNLESS IT'S BEEN REMOVED HAVE AN AREA OF OUR BRAIN CALL THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX THE WORDS PREFRONTAL QUARTEX ACTUALLY REFERS TO A FAIRLY VARIED REAL ESTATE WITHIN THE HUMAN BRAIN SO IT'S NOT ONE AREA OF THE HUMAN BRAIN PREFRONTAL QUARTEX ACTUALLY INCLUDES A LOT OF DIFFERENT SUBDIVISIONS THAT DO DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE CONTECTS OF COGNITION AND DIRECTING ACTION WITH HOLDING ACTION THESE KINDS OF THINGS BUT ONE OF THE MAIN FUNCTIONS OF THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEXT IS THAT WHEN IT'S WORKING WELL IT ALLOWS US TO DIRECT OUR FOCUS IN OUR COGNITION OUR THINKING IN A CONTEXT DEPENDENT WAY SO ONE OF THE SIMPLEST WAYS TO DESCRIBE THIS IS THAT WHEN YOU TOOK MATH AND HIGH SCHOOL ARE F YOUAR STILL TAKING MASS YOUR BRAIN HAD TO CARRY OUT CERTAIN TYPES OF COGNAIVE OPERATIONS THAT WERE VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE TYPES OF COGNIVE OPERATIONS THAT YOU NEED TO CARRY OUT IN YOUR HISTORY CLASS OR YOUR SOCIAL STUDIES CLASS BUT THERE WERE SOME FEATURES OF ALL THREE OF THOSE CLASSES THAT WERE THE SAME IN THE SENSE THAT PRESUMEBLY YOU HAD TO SIT IN A CHAIR FOR ALL THOSE CLASSES YOU FOLLOWED TO CERTAIN SET OF RULES THAT PARTAIN TO ALL THREE OF THOSE DIFFERENT CLASSES EVEN THOUH THEIR DIFFERENT SUBJECTS BUT THEN THERE WERE CERTAIN RULES THAT PERTAIN JUST TO MATHEMATICS CERTAIN RULES THAT YOU FOLLOWED BECAUSE OF PARTICULAR TEACHER WAS STRICT NOT BECAUSE OF THE TOPIC THEY WERE COVERING AS WELL AS CERTAIN RULES THAT MAY BEU DID NOT PAY ATTENTION TO BECAUSE THE DIFFEREN TEACHER WAS A LITTLE MORE LAX FOR INSTANCE MAY BE THOSE THE TEACHER LET YOU PUT YOUR FEET UP ON THE CHAIR IN FRONT OF YOU MAY BE ANOTHER TEACHER FORBID THAT AT ALL COSTS THE POINT BEING THAT YOUR PREFRONTAL QUARTEX IS THE AREA OF YOUR BRAIN THAT ALONG WITH OTHER AIRS YOUR BRAIN INSURES THAT YOU ENGAGE IN CONTEXT SPECIFIC BEHAVIOUR CONTEX SPECIFIC THINKING AND CONTEXT PECIFIC UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT YOU SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT DO NOW COGNIFLEXIBILITY A SIMILAR IN THE SENSE THAT IT DESCRIBES YOUR ABILI E TO SWITCH THE TYPES OF COGNIVE OPERATIONS AS THE NAME SUGGESTS DEPENDING ON WHAT SORTS OF THINGS YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN OR UNDERSTAND AND IT'S LOT MORE EXTENSIVE THAN THAT IN FACT WE WILL PROBABLY DO IN ENTIRE EPISODE ALL ABOUT BOTH COGNIFLEXIBILITY AND PERHAPS EVEN A SEPARATE EPISODE ON TASK SWITCHIN BUT TASK SWITCHING IS SOMEWHAT DISTINCT FROM COGNIVE FLEXIBILITY FIRST OF ALL TASK SWITCHING REQUIRES COGNIVE FLEXIBILITY BUT THEY ARE NOT THE SAME THING NOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TASK SWITCHING OR RATHER WHEN YOU SEE TASK SWITCHING IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE MOST OFTEN IT HAS TO DO WITH PEOPLE PERFORMING ONE PARTICULAR TYPE OF MENTAL OR PHYSICAL OPERATION ISTEY THEY ARE THEIR MANEUVERING THINGS WITH THEIR HANDS OR OTHER PARTS OF THEIR BODY OR THEY ARE REQUIRED TO CARRY AT ONE SPECIFIC TYPE OF MENTAL PROCESS AND THEN THEY ARE REQUIRED EITHER AT RANDOM INTERVALS OR SPECIFIC INTERVALS MAY BE EVERY TEN MINUTES OR SO TO SWITCH THEIR ATTENTION AND TO DO A DIFFERENT TASK ENTIRELY NOW IN THE LABORATORY EXPERIMENT SITUATION THIS IS MOST TYPICALLY BEEN CARRIED OUT THE FOLLOWING WAY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DO ONE COGNIVE TASK MAYBE MATHEMATICS OR THEY ARE GOING TO COUNT FOR INSTANCE FROM ONE UP TO INFINITY AS HIGH AS THEY CAN GO AN GIVE AN AMOUNT OF TIME IN INCREMENTS OF SAY SEVEN OR INCREMENTS OF SEVEN PLUS ONE THAN SEVEN MINUS ONE SO THESE CAN BE MADE INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT YOU GET THE IDEA AND THEN PERHAPS A TONE IS PLAYED OR THEY'LL GET A SIGNAL FROM THE EXPERIMENTOR AND THEN THEY NEED TO SWITCH THEIR TASK TO DOING SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT BUT ALSO COGNITIVE THAT'S THE MOST TYPICAL ARRANGEMENT OR ANOTHER TYPICAL ARRANGEMENT IN A TASK SWITCHING EXPERIMENT IS THAT THE SUBJECT THE PERSON IN THE TASK WITCHING EXPERIMENT WILL BE ASK TO DO SOME SORT OF PHYSICAL MANIPULATION OF OBJECTS MAY BE PLACEMENT OF PUZZLE PIECES INTO THE CORT CONFIGURATION THEN AT SOME DESIGNATED INTERVAL OR INTERVALS THEY WILL HAVE TO SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT MANUAL TASK FEW ERE NOT ZERO BUT FEWER EXPERIMENTS HAVE EXAMINED TAST SWITCHING BETWEEN PHYSICAL AN COGNITIVE TASKS OK NOW THERE ARE THESE KIND OF OUTRAGEOUS EXAMPLES THAT YOU CAN FIND ON THE INTERNETE AN BY THE WAY I DON'T SUGGESTS THAT ANYONE GO ENGAGE IN THESE EXAMPLES IN REAL LIFE OF KIND OF EXTREME TAST SWITCHING ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE ONES WOULD BE CHESS BOXING BELIEVE OU'RE NOT THIS EXISTS WHERE A TWO PEOPLE WILL ANTER A RING AND THEY WILL SIT DOWN AT A TABLE AND THEY WILL PLAY CHESS FOR A GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME SO THE'RE ENTIRELY FOCUSED ON PLAIN CHESS THEN A BUZZER WILL GO OFF THE CHESS TABL WILL BE CLEAR THE CHAIRS WILL BE CLEARED AND THEY WILL BE EXPECTED TO BOX LITERALLY FIGHT FOR A ROUND OF SAY A MINUTE TO THREE MINUTES AND THEN GO BACK TO CHESS THAN TO BOXING SO CALLED CHESS BOXING AGAIN I'M NOT SUGGESTING WILL CHESS BOX BUT I KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE CHALLENGES WITH TAST SWITCHING AND HERE I CAN RAISE MY HAND AND SAY THAT I'M ONE SUCH PERSON I'VE ALWAYS HAD A PRETTY GOOD ABILITY TO DROP INTO DEEP FOCUS AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME YOU KNOW I LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE TAKESTLE OF THE TIME TO GET INTO A BOOK CHAPTER OR TO GET INTO A MODE OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE BUT ONCE I'M DOING SOMETHING I TIN TO BE VERY VERY FOCUSED ON THAT AND I HAVE A MUCH GREATER CHALLENGE IN SWITCHING OUT OF THAT FOCUSED MODE TO DOING THE NEXT THING WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY OFTENTIMES I RUN TARDY BECAUSE I'M STILL MENTALLY THINKING ABOUT OR PHYSICALLY ENGAGED IN THE THING THAT I WAS DOING BEFORE AH THIS IS SOMETHING I'M CONSTANTLY WORKING ON AND AS THE CONSEQUENCE I'VE HAD TO SEEK OUT AN IMPLEMENT CERTAIN TOOLS TO IMPROVE MY ABILITY TO TAST SWITCH SO I'M GOING TO SHARE A FEW OF THOSE TOOLS WITH YOU NOW BECAUSE I KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE PROBABLY STRUGGLE WITH THE SAME THING AND AS I MENTIONED EARLLY I'M ALSO GOING TO DO A FULL LENGT EPISODE ABOUT TAST SWITCHING BOTH THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS OF TAST SWITCHING AS WELL AS A MORE EXTENSIVE LIST OF TOOLS RELATE TO TAST SWITCHING AS A FULL LENGTH HUBERMAN LAD POD CAST EPISODE SO HOW CAN WE GET BETTER TAST SWITCHING WELL SHORT OF HAVING SOMEBODY SCRUFF YOU BY THE NECK AND FORCE YOU TO STOP WHATEVER ACTIVITY YOU'RE DOING AND ENGAGE IN THE N EXE ACTIVITY THAT YOU'RE DOING ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT OUR ABILITY TO TAST SWITCH THAT'S NICELY SUPPORTED BOTH TAT THE MECHANISTIC LEVEL AND AT THE PRACTICAL LEVEL WITHIN THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE IS TO INTRODUCE SHORT TRANSITION GAPS BETWEEN THE ACTIVITIES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SWITCH BETWEEN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IN MY OPINION HAS NOT BEEN DISCUSSED ENOUGH IN FACT ONE WAS LAST TIME YOU HEARD ABOUT THE REQUIREMENT FOR INTRODUCING GAPS BETWEEN TASKS IF YOU WANT TO SWITCH BETWEEN THEM MORE EFFICIENTLY AND YET AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS NOT BEING DISCUSSED VERY OFTEN I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE PLACED AN UNDUE BURDEN ON THEMSELVES FOR INSTANCE A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT WHEN YOU SIT DOWN WITH A BOOK AND YOUARE GOING TO READ THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY FOCUS ON THE MATERIAL THAT YOU'RE READING AND NOT HAVE YOUR MIND FLITTING ABOUT DURING THE FIRST FIVE MAYBE EVEN TEN MINUTES OF READING A BOOK CHAPTER UNLESS YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY INTHRALLED FROM THE FIRST WORD OR YOU ARE INTENSELY CURIOUS WHAT THE MATERIAL IN THAT BOOK CHAPTER IS IN MAYBE THAT BOOK CHAPTER IS ABOUT YOU AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU NEXT IN YOUR LIFE MAYBE THE NEWS ARTICLE IS ABOUT SOMETHIN THAT YOU CARE OH SO MUCH ABOUT BUT UNLESS IT'S ONE OF THOSE SPECIFIC INSTANCES IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT FIVE OR TEN MINUTES BEFORE THE NURL CIRCUITS IN YOUR BRAIN THAT ARE REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND AND DIGEST AND COMMIT THAT MATERIAL TO MEMORY ARE GOING TO COME ON LINE AT THE LEVELS OF ACTIVITY THAT ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED FOR YOU TO EXPERIENCE THAT AS INTENSE FOCUS OR EVEN AS MILD FOCUS BECAUSE THE ACTIVITY OF THE BRAIN IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE IN A PUSHPULL THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING TAST WITCHEN WHEN YOU GO FROM ONE TASK AND MAYBE THE TASK WAS SIMPLY TO WALK OVER TO WHERE THE BOOK IS LOCATED TO FOCUSING ON THE MATERIAL WITHIN THAT BOOK YOU HAVE TO BOTH ENGAGE ACTIVITY WITHIN CERTAINERL CIRCUITS AND YOU NEED TO DISENGAGE THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER NERL CIRCUTS NOW SOMETIMES THIS IS REFERRED TO AS INHIBITION OF CERTAIN NERL CIRCUITS OTHER TIMES IS JUST CAN BE A DISSIPATION OF ACTIVITY OF THOSE NAURAL CIRCUS THAS JUST GOINGTO QUIET DOWN LIKE A DIMMING OF THE LIGHTS IN A PARTICULAR ROOM WHILE THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER NARL CIRCUITS INCREASES A CASE OF THE FIRST THING THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU WANT TO GET BETTER TASK WITCHING IS THAT YOU CANNOT AND YOU SHOULD NOT EXPECT YOURSELF TO IMMEDIATELY DROP INTO A NARROW TRENCH OF FOCUS OR A NARROW TRENCH OF ABILITY FOR ANYTHING THAT YOUARE NOT ALREADY EXTREMELY SKILLED AT OR EXTREMELY INTERESTED IN KNOWING OKA ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THIS IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED IS THAT FOR INSTANCE IF WE RECEIVE A TEX MESSAGE FROM SOMEBODY AND WE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN WHAT'S CONTAINED IN THAT TEX MESSAGE MAY BE WHEN EAGERLY ANTICIPATING THE DOT DOT DOT YOU KNOW IN THAT LITTLE WINDOW WHERE THE TEXT MESSAGE IS GOING TO ARRIVE LIKE HERE T COMES HERE IT COMES HERE IT COMES IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE YOU ARE ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY PAY ATTENTION AND ABSORB INFORMATION FOR INSTANCE IF YOU ARE TRYING TO MEET SOMEBODY IN A BIG CITY AND YOU NEET TO NO EXACTLY WHERE TO MEED THEM AN YOU'VE ARRIVED AT THE PLACE WHERE YOU THOUGHT YOU NEED TO BE AND THEN YOU CAN'T FIND THEM AN YOUR WAITING WAITING WHERE ORE YOU WER AND YOU KNOW YOUARE GOING TO COMMIT THAT INFORMATION MEMORY IN YOU'RE GOING TO ACT ON IT WHEN YOU SIT DOWN TO READ A BOOK OF UNKNOWN CONTENT OR WHERE YOU HAVE JUST A GENERAL SENSE OF WHAT THE CONTENT IS OR WHEN YOU SIT DOWN TO DO SOMETHING LIKE WORK ON A SPREAD SHEET OR YOUR TAXES OR ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEBODY EXPECT A FIVE TO TEN MINUTE TRANSITION PERIOD I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH BECAUE I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE MISTAKENLY THINK THAT THEY HAVE ISSUES WITH ATTENTION AND PERHAPS INDEED THEY HAVE CLENICALLY DIGNOSIBLE ATTENTION DEFISIT HAVE OR ACTIVITY DISORDER OR SOME OTHER FORM OF ATTENTION DEFISA DISORDER CERTAINLY CAN'T RULE THAT OUT BASED ON THIS CONVERSATION ALONE BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE PLACE THIS UNFAIR BURDEN ON THEMSELVES TO IMMEDIATELY BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON A GIVEN TASK AND THIS IS ALSO TRUE FOR PHYSICAL TASKS IF YOU GO TO THE GIM TO WORK OUT OR YOU'RE HEADING OUT ON A RUN OR CYCLING EXPEDITION THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD IMMEDIATELY BE ABLE TO CYCLE AT YOUR PIQUE PERF ORMENTS OR THAT YOU COULD PERFORM SETS AND RAPS IN THE GIM AS BEST AS YOU POSSIBLY COULD WITHOUT ANY WARM UP WITHOUT ANY TRANSITION PERIOD THAT YOU COULD FORGET ABOUT THE DIFFICULT OR MADE EVEN GREAT CONVERSATION THAT OU ARE HAVING ON THE WAY IN WHERE THAT YOU COULD FORGET ABOUT OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT YOU NEED TO DO IN THE REST TO YOUR DAY I MEAN THAT JUST COMPLETELY UNFAIR AND IT DOESN'T MATCH AT ALL THE WAY THAT YOU'RE NERL CIRCUIT'S WORK SO YOU REALLY NEED TO MATCH YOUR EXPECTATION OF YOUR ABILITY TO FOCUS ON IN PERFORM A GIVEN TASK WHETHER NOT'S COGNITIVE OR PHYSICAL TO THE ACTUAL UNDERLYING BIOLOGY OCASE SO THAT'S THE FIRST POINT THE SECOND POINT IS THAT WE KNOW THAT IF YOU WANT TO SWITCH FROM ONE TASK TO ANOTHER TASK THAT YOU ARE MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO DROP INTO FULL TASK ENGAGEMENT OR RATHER ENGAGEMENT WITH TASK B FOLLOWING TASKE IF YOU TRY AND GO IMMEDIATELY FROM TASKAT TO TASK BE THAT EVEN THE INTRODUCTION I FIND THE SOCOAL EVEN THE INTRODUCTION OF AN ARBITRARY BUT VERY SHORT TRANSITION PERIOD OF SAY FIFTEEN SECONDS WHERE YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE INTRODUCING FIFTEEN SECONDS OF TRANSITION AND YOU DESIGNATE IT AS TRANSITION WILL ALLOW YOU TO ENGAGE IN A MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE COMPLETE LEVEL OF TASK EXECUTION ON TASK B IF YOU INTRODUCE EVEN A BRIEF TRANSITION PERIOD NOW THIS I FIND FASCINATING BECAUSE WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT THERE ARE TOP DOWN INFLUENCES THERE ARE LITERALLY THINGS THAT WE CAN TELL OURSELVES BASED ON AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS THAT ALLOW US TO TASKS WICH BETTER AND THE CERTAINLY DOESN'T INVOLVE TAKING ANY KIND OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG OR SUPPLEMENT OR DOING ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY EXCEPT AS YOU GO FROM TASKA TO TASK B KNOWING AND DESIGNATING THAT A TRANSITION PERIOD EVEN A VERY BRIEF ONE WHERE YOU ARE NOT TRYING TO PERFORM TASK BE AND THA YOU DESIGNATED THIS IS A TRANSITION PERIOD I'M NOT TRYING TO FOCUS ON THE NEXT THING THAT I NEED TO DO MY FOCUS ON IT INADVERTENTLY BUT I'M NOT DELIBERATELY TRYING TO FOCUS ON IT RATHER I'M GOING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT I JUST DID AND THE FACT THAT I'M NO LONGER DOING THAT COME LEAVING IT LIKE A FOG BEHIND A RITE YOU'RE TRING TO MOVE FROM THIS DEEP TRENCH OF ATTENTION HOPEFULLY ON TASKE OR MAYBEYOU DIDN'T ACHIEVE A DEEP TRENCH OF ATTENTION AND YOU'RE NOW DONE WITH TASKE AND YOU'RE NOT PLACING THIS UNFAIR EXPECTATION ON YOUR NORAL CIRCUS TO JUST FLIP TO TASK BE AND YOU'RE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGING THAT TASK BEE IS GOING TO TAKE FIVE TO TEN MINUTES TO DROP IN TOO FULLY WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THAT BUT YOU'RE GOING TO SHORTEN THAT FIVE TO TEN MINUTES BY DELIBERATELY INTRODUCING A TRANSITION PERIOD AND WHAT COMES IN THAT TRANSITION PERIOD AND IT'S DURATION IS IMPORTANT SO FIRST LET'S DEAL WITH THE DURATION HOW LONG SHOULD THE TRANSITION PERIOD BE WELL THAT IS  GOING TO SCALE DIRECTLY WITH HOW LONG YOU WERE IN A DEEP TRENCH OF FOCUS FOR TASKE BUT LET'S US SOON TASKAT WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS KIND O LIGHT FOR YOU MABEO'RE JUST HANDLING SOME MEMAL MAYBE OU'RE TALKING TO A CO WORKER MAYBE YOU WERE AT A BOARD MEATING AND IT WAS KIND OF LIGHT YOU KNOW THE STUFF WAS JUS SO KI THAT YOU'RE USE TO THE STUFF THIS THE STUFF THAT YOU DO ALL THE TIME NOW YOU'REHEAD TO BACK TO YOUR DESK YOUR HEADED TO YOUR NEXT CLASS OR PERHAPS YOU DOD WORK OUT THAT MORNING AND NOW YOU'RE GING TA HEAD TO YOU'RE WORKPLACE OF WORK OR MAYBE 'RE LEAVING WORK IN YOU'RE GOING TO ENGAGE WITH FAMILY AND YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO SWITCH ALL THESE COGNIVE OPERATIONS YOU NEED TO DUMP THE STUFF THAT YOU ARE JUST DOING COGNIVELY AND YOU NOW NEED TO DO A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS CONTEXT IS SWITCHING TASK IS SWITCHIN WELL JUST ASK YOURSELF HOW DEEPLY WAS I INTRENCHED IN THAT OTHER ACTIVITY WAS MY MIND FLITTING TO OTHER THINGS OR IF I WAS IN A DEEP TRENCH OF A TENSION FOR THAT GIVEN THING WELL THEN YOU SHOULD GIVE YOURSELF SLIGHTLY LONGER FOR THIS TRANSITION PERIOD MAYBE FIVE OR EVEN TEN MINUTES IF YOU HAVE THAT TIME BUT EVEN IF YOU GIVE YOURSELF AS SHORT AS SIXTY TO NINETY SECONDS OF TRANSITION AND YOU JUST DESET DESIGNATE ETXCUSE ME AS TRANSITION YOU'RE GOING TO BENEFIT IN TERMS OF YOURABILITY TO DO THE NEXT TASK SO TO BE VERY CLEAR IF YOU WERE IN KIND OF A LIGHT TASK OR SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T HAVE MUCH COGNIVE DEMAND WELL THEN THE TRANSITION PERIOD CAN BE FAIRLY SHORT IT CAN BE JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES RATHER IF YOU WERE IN A DEEP TRENCH OF ATTENTION YOU REALLY ENGAGED IN THAT FIRST TASK I SUGGEST GIVENG YOURSELF A COUPLE OF MINUTES OR MORE MAY BE AS MUCH AS FIVE TO TEN MINUTES BUT YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE THAT MUCH TIME IN WHICH CASE GIVE YOURSELF ANY KIND OF TRANSITION EVEN IF ITS TEN SECONDS MIGHT I CERTAINLY HAVE HAD TIMES IN MY LIFE IN PARTICULAR WHEN I WAS A NEW ASSISTANT PROFESSOR MEANING BEFORE I GOT TENURE WHERE I REMEMBER SITTING DOWN TO WORK ON A GRANT I GET TWO LINES OUT SOME ONE WOULD KNOCK ON THE DOOR A WHERE ARE THE WHATEVER THE THIRTY MILL STRINCHIS WHERE DO WE KEEP THE BUFFERERS ORE YOU KNOWWHERES  YOU KNOW DID WE GET THIS THING IN OKIN THAN I HAVE TO SHIFT MY ATTENTION THAT GO BACK TO WRIDING IN THAM BE YOU KNOW DISTRACTED BY SOMETHING ELSE AGAIN WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT PEOPLE WERE DISTRACTING ME UNFAIRLY IT WAS SIMPLY THE CASE THAT AT THAT TIME MY LIFE REQUIRED BEING INVOLVED IN A LOT MORE THINGS THAN IT DID AS MY CAREER PROGRESSED AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM SO THE POINT BEING THAT IF YOU ARE DEEPLY ENGAGED IN ACTIVITY GIVE YOURSELF A LITLE BIT LONGER IN THE TRANSITION PERIOD BETWEEN THEM IF YOU ARE SORT OF SUPERFICIALLY INVOLVED IN ACTIVITY YOU NEED LESS OF A TRANSITION PERIOD BUT YOU NEED A TRANSITION PERIOD WHAT SHOULD COME DURING THAT TRANSITION PERIOD WELL THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO ARRIVE IN THAT TRANSITION PERIOD IS A RELATIVE LACK OF ATTENTION TO ANYTHING NEW THIS IS WHAT SO DESTRUCTIVE ABOUT THE PHONE AND KEEP IN MIND I AM NOT ONE OF THESE PEOPLE THAT THINKS THAT SMART PHONES ARE TERRIBLE IN FACT I USE MINE PLURREL VERY OFTEN ALL DAY OFTEN NOT NECURELY DURING DEEP COGNA FOCUS BUT IN BETWEEN THOSE BOUTS OF FOCUS I HAVE TO TEXT MESSAGE PEOPLE I DOU WORK ON THERE UMON SOCIAL MEDIA SO CERTAINLY NOT DEMINIZING THE SMART PHONE HOWEVER IF YOU FINISH I GIVE AN ACTIVITY WHETHER NOT TS COGNIVE OR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOU ARE HEADED TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT REQUIRES YOU DO A NEW TASK AND T AT THAT TASK REQUIRES SIGNIF GEN AMOUNTS OF ATTENTION AND FOCUS WELL THEN YOU WOULD DO VERY WELL TO ALLOW YOURSELF A PERIOD OF ANYWHERE FROM TWO MINUTES TO MAY BE AS LONG AS TEN MINUTES IN KNOW HES CAN BE VERY HARD FOR PEOPLE BUT TWO MINUTES TO AS LONG AS TEN MINUTES WHERE YOU ARE NOT LOOKING AT YOUR PHONE YOU'RE NOT TEXTING YOU'RE NOT ON SOCIAMEDIA YOU'RE NOT FORAGING FOR ANYTHING IN FACT YOU'RE TRYING TO LIMIT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE BRINGING INTO YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO WALK AROUND WITH EYES CLOSE AND TRYING NOT HERE IN NOT SEE LET'S BE PRACTICAL FOLKS THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DO ANYWAY CAN'T SHUT DOWN YOUR BRAIN WHILE AWAKE YOU CAN GO INTO STATES OF DEEPER RELAXATION THERE'S NON SLEEP DEEP BREAST WHICH YOU WILL TALK ABOUT NILABIT BUT YOU CAN'T SHUT OFF YOUR BRAIN DELIBERATELY I CAN NOT IN ANY HEALTHY WAY THAT IS BUT BY INTRODUCING THESE TRANSITION ZONES OR TRANSITION PERIODS AS WILL CALL THEM OF TWO TO TEN MINUTES BETWEEN DIFFERENT TASK AND MAKING SURE THAT WITHIN THOSE TRANSITION PERIODS YOU ARE NOT BRINGING IN NEW INFORMATION AGAIN ANOTHER CONTAT THAN WHAT WHAT YOU REALLY DOING WHILE YOU'RE INSURING THAT OU'RE NOT GOING FROM TASKE TO TASK BE TO TASK SEE RIGHT WHAT WE'RE TOGGAMOUT HERE IS TRYING TO LIMIT YOUR TASK WHITCHING BETWEEN TASKE AND TASK BE AND NOT INTRODUCING ANOTHER TASK IND BETWEEN AND YOU MIGHT THINK THAT LOOKING AT YOUR PHONE IS NOT A TASK WRITE IT SO EASY AT SO REFLEXIF BUT IT IS IT'S BRINGING IN A LOT OF NEW CONTAXT IN PARTICULAR PICTURES AND MOVIES WHICH ARE TREMENDOUS STIMULUS FOR THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND ANCHORING YOUR ATTENTION IT'S BRINGING IN NOW IDEAS NEW THOUGHTS THAT NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY ARE GOING TO INTRUDE INTO YOUR ABILITY TO PERFORM TASK BE SO WHEN PEOPLE SAY HOW TO I GET BETTER A TASK WHITCHING I IMMEDIATELY WANT TO SAY PLEASE DON'T INTRODUCE YET MORE TASKS RIGHT SWITCHING FROM ONE TASK TO ANOTHER IS HARD ENOUGH ALREADY DON'T INTRODUCE ANOTHER TASK IN BETWEEN NOW SOME OF YOU MIGHT TAKE THIS TO MEAN THAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH A CO WORKER AFTER A MEETING WHILE WALKING DOWN THE HALL I'M NOT SAYING THAT I STILL ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BE SOCIAL I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO ENGAGE IN ORKPLACE ENVIRONMENTS HOWEVER I WILL SAY AFTER MANY YEARS OF WORKING IN LABORATORIES THAT AT TIMES WERE QUITE LARGE AND YOU WALK INTO THE LAB IN TERE LOT OF DIFFERENTHINGS GOING ON ONE OF THINGS THAT YOU LEARN HOW TO DO IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET GOOD AT YOUR CRAFT IS DOD NOT PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON WITH EVERYONE CROWDED AROUND A COMPUTER LOOKING AT LIKE WHO'S WINNING AT THE WORLDCUP I'M NOT TUNG TO INSULT SULKER PLAYERS HERE I ENJOY SOCKER BOTH PLAYING IT AND OBSERVING IT BUT ONE HAS TO SORT OF SCRUFF THEMSELVES A LITTLE BIT IN TRYING TO LIMIT THEIR ATTENTION TO A NUMBER DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND REALLY GO FROM TASKAD TO TASK BE IN A REALLY DEDICATED WAY SHORT LISTS BENEFIT CERTAIN PEOPLE I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE OR LISTMAKERS OUT THERE THEY LIKE TO YOU'LL PUT TWO OR THREE THINGS OR MAY BE TWENTY THINGS THAT THEYRE GOING TO ACCOMPLISH EATS TAY ONE OF THE BEST TOOLS THAT I'VER LEARNED BOTH FOR SAKE OF TASKS WITCHING BUT ALSO FOR SAKE OF JUST GETTING THINGS DONE ON A CONSISTENT BASIS I PICKED UP WHILE I WAS A MASTER STUDENT BERKELEY A VERY ACCOMPLISH PROFESSOR AT THAT TIME TOLD ME THAT HE WRITES DOWN EVERY DAY THREE THINGS THAT HE'S GOING TO ACCOMPLISH AND ONLY THREE THINGS NEVER MORE THAN THREE NOW HE ALSO INCLUDED OTHER ACTIVITIES IN FACT HE WAS A QUITE ACTIVE IN HIS PHYSICAL LIFE SO HE WROTE IS BIKE TO CAMPUS HE ALSO WAS A RUNNER HE ALSO WINT TO THE GIM HE DID NOT INCLUDE THOSE ON HIS LIST OF THREE THINGS BUT HE WOULD WRITE DOWN NO MORE THAN THREE CRITICAL THINGS TO DO EACH DAY SO HE HAD THREE CRITICAL TASKS SO I'VE ENCLOYED THAT METHOD AS WELL I'LL WRITE DOWN ONE SOMETIMES TO MOST OFTEN THREE BUT IF I CAN JUST ONE OR TWO TASKS THAT I NEED TO COMPLETE EACH DAY AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS CONSIDERED PART OF THE LET'S JUS SAY AUTOMATICITY FUNCTION OF MY DAY THINGS THAT I ALREADY KNOW HOW TO DO THAT DON'T REQUIRE A TON OF COGNE FOCUS BUT I LIMIT THE THINGS THAT REQUIRE A LOT OF COGNA FOCUS TO THREE THINGS PERDAY HOWEVER THOSE THREE THINGS PER DAY CAN TAKE UP MANY MANY HOURS EACH AND CERTAINLY ON THE WHOLE OKEN ONO THERE ARE ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT ONE CAN DO TO IMPROVE YOUR ABILITY TO TASK WITCH AND ONE OF THINGS THAT I'V FOUND PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL IS NOT A MEDITATION BUT RATHER IS A PERCEPTINAL EXERCISE AND THIS IS A PERCEPTIAL EXERCISE THAT I LEARNED ABOUT WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT BUT IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT CONTECT AND HAS TO DO WITH THE WAY THAT YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM AND THE PARTS OF YOUR BRAIN THAT PARTS TIME ARE RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER AND INFLUENCE ONE ANOTHER NOW THE REASON THIS TOOLL MAKE SENSE FOR IMPROVING YOUR ABILITY TAST SWITCH IS BECAUSE TURNS OUT THAT WHERE YOU FOCUS YOUR VISUAL ATTENTION STRONGLY INFLUENCES THE WAY THAT YOUR BRAIN PARTSIS TIME SO I'LL DESCRIBE THE TOOL FIRST AND THEN I'LL GET A LUBIT INTO THE UNDERLING MECHANISMS BUT AGAIN I'LL GET DEEP INTO THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS AS WELL AS THE TOOL AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL TOOLS IN A FUTURE EPISODE ABOUT TASTSWITCHING ON THE HUBERMANLAT POTCAST SO IF YOU WERE TO FOR INSTANCE CLOSE YOUR EYES AND NOT LOOK AT ANYTHING IN YOUR EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT AND JUST CONCENTRATE FOR INSTANCE ON YOUR BREATHING OR THE FEELING ON THE SURFACE OF YOUR SKIN I KNOW THIS IS STING TES OUND LIKE MEDITATION BUT TRUST ME IT'S NOT MEDITATION YOUR PERCEPTION OF TIME THAT IS HOW FINELY YOU ARE SLICING TIME WOULD BE DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT THEND IF YOU WERE TO OPEN YOUR EYES AND FOCUS ON A FARAWAY LOCATION A WAY OFF IN THE HORIZON AND NOT FOCUS ON YOUR BODILY SENSATIONS SIMILARLY IF YOU WERE TO FOCUSS YOUR ATTENTION ON SOME INTERMEDIATE LOCATION MAYBE LET'S SAY TTWENTY FEET AWAY AND CSIMULTANEOUSLY FOCUS ON YOUR INTERNAL BODILY SENSATIONS OR THE SURFACE OF YOUR SKIN YOUR PERCEPTION OF TIME HOW QUICKLY TIME WAS PASSING WOULD ALSO BE DIFFERENT THEN IF YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES OR IF YOU WARE LOOKING AT SOME DISTANT LOCATION SO THE PERCEPTIOOL TOOL FOR TASS SWITCHING IS A VERY SIMPLE ONE IT'S ONE THAT RENKCLY I DO EVERY MORNING AND HAVE FOR MANY YEARS NOW AT LEAST FOR ME HAS REALLY ENHANCED MY ABILITY TO TASTSWITCH AND THAT IS TO JUST TAKE A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND THIS REALLY ONLY TAKES ABOUT TWO OR THREE MINUTES AND TYPICALLY WHAT I WILL DO AS I'LL START BY CLOSING MY EYES THOUGH I SHOULD MENTION I TYPICALLY DO THI IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE IDEALLY I CAN SEE OFF INTO THE DISTANCE PERHAPS FROM A BALCONY IF I'M AN APARTMENT OR HOUSE IDEALLY OUTDOORS BUT IF I'M INDOORS I'LL STILL DO THIS I'LL JUST LOOK AS FAR OFF INTO THE DISTANCE AS I CAN WHEN THAT STEP IS REQUIRED SO BUT I START OFF BY CLOSING MY EYES AND SINCIALY NOT LOOKING AT ANYTHING BUT DIRECTING MY BRAINS FOCUS TO EITHER THE SURFACE OF MY BODY JUST WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHAT IT'S IN CONTACT WITH OR NOT IN CONTACT WITH MAYBE MY BREATHING THEN I'LL OPEN MY EYES AND I WILL FOCUS ON SOME LOCATION ON MY BODY BUT MY BODILY SURFACS LIKE MY HAND AT SOME DISTANCE AND I'LL FOCUS MY ATTENTION THERE MAYBE FOR JUST FIVE TO FIFTEEN SECONDS I SHOULD MENTION THAT THE FIRST STATION AS I CALL THEM WHERE MY EYES WERE CLOSED AND WAS FOCUS IN MY BODILY SENSATIONS I'LL SO JUST DO THAT FOR ABOUT FIVE TO FIFTEEN SECONDS AND I DON'T COUNT SPECIFICALLY I'M JUST AN A ROUGH ROUGHLY FIVE TO FIFTEEN SECONDS KISS A SECOND STATION YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE SURFACE OF YOUR HAND AND IF YOU LIKE YOU CAN ALSO CONCENTRATE ON YOUR BREATHING BUT TYPICALLY PEOPLE JUST FOCUS ON SOME SPECIVIC LOCATION ON THEIR HAND THEN I'LL TIICALLY LOWER MY HAND THEN I'LL LOOK OFF INTO THE DISTANCE MAY BE FIVE TO TEN FEET DOESN'T REALLY MATTER FOCUSS MY VISUAL ATTENTION THERE TRY AND HOLD THAT FOCUS FOR FIVE TO FIFTEEN SECONDS THEN I'LL LOOK FURTHER OFF IN THE DISTANCE MAYBE FURTHER STILL OFF INTO THE DISTANCE ULTIMATELY WHAT I TRY AND DO IS LOOK AT A LOCATION AS FAR OFF IN DISTANCE INTO THAT DISTANCE SCUSE ME AS I POSSIBLY CAN AND I'M ALSO TRYING TO PAY ATTENTION MY BREATHING AT THE SAME TIME JUST AS AWAY OF CALIBRATING MY LOCATION TO THE LOCATION THAT I'M LOOKING AT AND HOW GREAT THAT IS THEN TYPICALLY I'LL CLOSE MY EYES AND RETURN MY ATTENTION TO MY IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT AND MY BREATHING JUST IN THE LOCATION I'M IN AS SO THE ENTIRE THING ONLY TAKES ABOUT TWO MINUTES AGAIN STARTING WITH EYES CLOSE FOCUSSING ONSELF FIVE TO FIFTEEN SECONDS THEN EYES OPEN FOCUSSING ON  SURFACE OF ONE'S BODY THAT IS FOCSING ONE'S VISUAL ATTENTION FIVE TO FIFTEEN SECONDS MYBE TEN FEET AWAY THEN MAYBE FIFTY FEET AWAY YOUR THE METRIC SYSTEM OCAE METERS FOLKS WORKS JUST AS WELL THESE DISTANCES DO NOT HAVE TO BE PRERCISE AND THEN OFF TO THE HORIZON AND THEN BACK TO ONE'S IMMEDIATE LOCATION BY CLOSING ONE'S EYES NOW WHAT IS HAPPENING WHEN ONE DOES THIS PERCEPTINABL EXERCISE AND AGAIN IT'S A PERCEPTIONAL EXERCISE OF VISUAL PERCEPTIONAL EXERCISE WELL WHAT'S HAPPENING IS YOU ARE SHIFTING YOUR VISUAL FOLCUS OBVIOUSLY BUT YOU'RE ALSO SHIFTING THE WAY IN WHICH YOU FINE SLICE OR THICK SLICE TIME NOW YOUR ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE CONSCIOUSLY WHETHER NOT YOUR THIN SLICING OR THICK SLICING TIME IS MUCH HARDER TO GET A GRASP OF THEN IT IS TO GET A GRASP OF WHETHER NOT YOUR LOOKING AT YOUR HAND ARE OFTEN IN THE DISTANCE THAT'S KIND OF OBVIOUS BUT WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE S THAT AS YOU SHIFT YOUR ATTENTION FROM YOUR MEDIATE ENVIRONMENT OUT TO DIFFERENT DESIGNATED LOCATIONS IN YOUR VIRONMENT AND YOUR TIME PERCEPTION SHIFTS ACCORDINGLY YOU'AR ESSENTIALLY TRAINING YOUR BRAIN TO SHIFT VISUAL FOCUS AND THE WAY IN WHICH YOU PROCESS IN THE TIME DOMAIN AND THIS IS IMPORTANT IN THE CONTECTS OF TASKSWITCHING BECAUSE SO MUCH OF TASK SWITCHING IS NOT JUST TO UNDERSTAND OCAV I'M GOING FROM READING TO RUNNING OR FROM RUNNING TO READING AND THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF OPERATIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED IN ONE CASE VIRSES THE OTHER BUT ALSO A SHIFT IN THE NOURL CIRCUITS THAT UNDERLIE YOUR PERCEPTION OF TIME AND AGAIN THIS IS A TOPIC THAT DESERVES A MUCH MORE ELABORATE DISCUSSION BUT SO MUCH OF OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE A TASK WITH HIGH PROFICIENCY HAS TO DO WITH GETTING OUR THINKING IN OUR ACTIONS INTO THE CORRECT TIME DOMAIN NOW WHEN I SAY TIME DOMAIN I KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE CAN GET CONFUSED BECAUSE TIME IS TIME RIGHT PEOPLING OW WHAT DOYOU MEAN BY TIME DOMAIN SPACE DOMAIN MAKE SENSE YOU ARE NOT TO MY OUTER SPACE WHETHER NOT YOUR LOOKING IN ONE LOCATION OR ANOTHER CLOSE TO YOUR BODY OARE FAR AWAY FROM YOUR BODY OR DIFFERENT OF DOMAINS OF SPACE BUT THE TIME DOMAIN IS A LITTLE TRICK HERE FOR MOST PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND SO JUS THINK OF IT THIS WAY WHEN YOU SEE A SLOW MOTION MOVY WHAT YOUR SEEING IS A MOVY THAT WAS SHOT AT A HIGH FRAME RATE MANY FRAMES PER SECOND I THE TYPICAL SMART PHONE SHOOTS MOVIES AT ABOUT SIXTY FRAMES PER SECOND SOME OLDER ONES THIRTY FRAMES FER SECOND THE SLOW MO FUNCTION ON YOUR SMARTPHONE IS ACTUALLY A HIGH FRAME RATE FUNCTION YOU TOOK THE SAME MOVY BUT YOU TOOK IT AT HIGHER FRAME RATES YOU GET A LOT MORE IMAGES THEREFORE YOU CAN GENERATE SLOW MOTION SO WITH YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM WHEN YOU FOCUS VERY CLOSE IN TO YOUR BODY OR YOUR FOCUSSED ON BODILY SENSATIONS IN YOUR IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT YOU ARE FINE SLICING IN THE TIME DOMAIN MORE SO THEN WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING FURTHER OFF IN THE DISTANCE SIMILARLY WHEN OU ENGAGE IN ONE TYPE OF TASK LIKE A BOARD MEETING OR RESUME MEETING OR CONVERSATION WITH FRIENDS YOU ARE IN A VERY DIFFERENT SET OF NERL CIRCUIT FUNCTIONS THEN WHEN YOU SIT DOWN TO READ OR LEARN MATH OR LIFT WAIGHTS OR GO TO THERAPE OR GO FOR WALK WITH YOUR DOG FOR INSTANCE NOW IT SHOULD BE CLEAR WHY WHEN YOU MOVE FROM TASKET TO TASK BE YOU WANT TO A INTRODUCE A TRANSITION PERIOD CAN BE VERY BRIEF MAYBEYOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TIME FOR THE TWO MINUTE TRANSITION PARIED YOU JUST SAY OKA MIN A TRASITION PRAIRIE BETWEEN TASKET AND TASK BEON MOVING FROM THIS THING TO THAT THING I JUST NEED LIKE TEN SECONDS I'M AN A RECOGNIZE ON AN ACCOUNT DOWN TEN TO ONE OR ONE UP TO TEN DOESN'T MATTER THIS IS TRANSITION TIME BUT THIS IS NOT A TIME TO LOOK AT MY PHONE OR TO BE IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT TIME DOMAINS NOW YOU MIGHT SAY WELL DOES THAT MEAN I SHOULDN'T LOOK AT THE HORIZON WHILE IAM WALKING FROM MY MEETING BACK TO MY DESK NO NO NO NO THAT'S NOT THE WAY THAT YOUR BRAIN WORKS IT DOESN'T ANCHOR TO THINGS THAT JUST HAPPEN BENG YOUR EVIRONMENT UNLESS THEY'RE PARTICULAR INTEREST WHAT I'M SAYING IS SET OF TRANSITION PERIOD BETWEEN TASK I DEALLY TWO MAYBE AS LONG AS TEN MINUTES I'M ALSO SAYING THAT WHEN YOU SWITCH BETWEEN TASKS OR WHEN YOU INITIATE YOUR FIRST MAJYOUR TA SK OF THE DAY PLEASE EXPECT DO EXPECT A PERIOD IN WHICH IT'S HARD TO GET INTO THE GROOVE SO TO SPEAK AND IN ADDITION TO THAT I RECOMMEND HAVING SOME SORT OF PRACTICE AND I DESCRIBE THE PRACTICE THAT I'VE USED FOR SOME PERIATIVE TIME NOW AT LEAST FOR ME TO GREAT SUCCESS WHERE YOU ARE DELIBERATELY SHIFTING YOUR VISUAL ATTENTION BETWEEN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS CLOSE TO YOU IN FAR AWAY AND YOU'RE DOING THAT AS A PERCEPTIOAL PRACTICE AGAIN THE WHOLE THING ONLY TAKES ABOUT TWO MINUTES MAY BE THREE MINUTES AND YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO DO IT EVERY DAY I HAPPEN TO DO IT EVERY DAY BUT I MISS THE OCCASIONAL DAY HERE AND THERE AND EVEN IF YOU WERE TO DO THIS PERCEPTIOAL PRACTICE NO ONCE A WEEK OR THREE TIMES A WEEK I'M CERTAIN THAT YOU'LL BENEFIT BECAUSE IN DOING THAT PERCEPTINAL PRACTICE THERE'S ALSO AN IMMEDIATE RECOGNITION OF THE SORCE OF SHIFTS THAT YOUR BRAIN IS REQUIRED TO ENGAGE IN ANY TIME YOU MOVE FROM TASKKAY TO TASK BE OR FROM TASK BE O TASK SEE AND YOU START TO SEE AND FEEL LITERALLY SEE AND FEEL THE WAY THAT THAT TRANSITION OCCURS AND THAT IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME BUT THAT YOU CAN ACCELERATE THAT TRANSITION IF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT OH WHEN I'M LOOKING HERE AN ENGAGING IN THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR OR SETS OF TASKS AND THEN I'M NOW GOING TO BE EXPECTED TO ANOTHER TASK IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT THAT THE BRAIN IS GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO SHIFT OVER THE NARAL CIRCUITS THAT ARE ACTIVE AND LESS ACTIVE IN ORDER TO DO THAT BUT THAT YOU CAN ACCELERATE THAT PROCESS BY PRACTICING IT USING THAT PERCEPTIOAL TOOL THAT I DESCRIBED SO THERE I COVERED SOME SPECIFIC TOOLS THAT ONE CAN USE TO

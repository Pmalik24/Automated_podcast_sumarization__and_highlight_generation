THIS SAYS FUCKIT I'LL DO IT AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS SHE'S GOT LOTS OF OTHER STUFF BUT SHE MAKES TIME FOR THESE BILLS THEEN DOING IT FOR OVERA DECCATE PTHE LIFETIME VOTING BAN IS ENSHRINED IN THE MISSISSIPPI CONSTITUTION AND THE HISTORY OF HOWIT ENDED UP THERE IS PRETTY WELL DOCUMENTED AND REVEALING IT STARTS AFTER THE CIVIL WORM BLACK PEOPLE COULD FINALLY VOTE AND THERE WERE PUTTING PEOPLE IN OFFICSE INCLUDING THE FIRST BLACK YOU ASK SENATOR HIRUM RODS REVELS BUT THERE WAS BACK LASH IN EIGHTEEN NINETY WHITE LEADERS LIKE SENATOR JAMES GEORGE SAID THE STATE NEEDED TO HOLD A CONVENTION TO WRITE A NEW CONSTITUTION JEORGE SAID THE NEW SENSES WAS GOIN A SHOW THERE WERE MORE BLACK PEOPLE THAN WHITES AND MISSISSI AND THE GOAL OF THE CONVENTION SHOULD BE TO MAKE SURE WHITES CONTROLED THE GOVERNMENT THE PRESIDENT OF THE CONVENTION WAS A MAN NAMED SOLOMON CALHOUN WHO SAID QUOTE NEGRO SUFFRAGE IS AN EVIL AND AN EVIL TO BOTH RACES IN HIS OPENING SPEECH OF THE CONVENTION HE SAID THE VOTING SCHEME SHOULD BE ARRANGED TO KEEP WHITE PEOPLE IND POWER THIT DECIDED ON A FEW THINGS THERE WAS A POLTAX AND THIS REALLY VAGUE TEST CALLED THE UNDERSTANDING CLAUS THE SAID A VOTER HAD TO BE ABLE TO INTERPRET PART OF THE CONSTITUTION ONE NEWSPAPER CALLED IT A GIGANTIC FRAUD THEN THERE WAS THE PART IN THE NEW CONSTITUTION ABOUT CRIME AND VOTING THE CONSTITUTION SAYS THAT THEY ARE ELEVEN CRIMES THAT TAKE YOUR VOTING RIGHTS AWAY IN THOLS ARE BIG A ME TIMBER LARTINE ARSON I STEALIN WOOD OR SOMETHING STEALING TREASE TALK TO TO HISTORIANS WHO SAID THE LIST WAS CLEARLY MEANT TO TARGET BLACK PEOPLE CRIMES DELEGATES OT THE CONVENTION THOUGHT BLACK PEOPLE WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT AND THE NOVEL IDEA THAT YOU COULD GET YOUR RITES BACK IF YOU GET A BILL THRO THE LEGISLATURE WITH YOUR NAME ON IT THAT WAS ALSO IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETY CONSTITUTION HE STORIANS DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HOW IT ENDED UP AND THERE MAYBE THEY WERE TRYING TO KEEP THE GOVERNOR FROM GAINING TOO MUCH POWER OR MAYBE THEY WANTED A WAY TO HELP THEIR WHITE FRIENDS AND FAMILY IF THEY HAPPENED TO COMMIT ONE OF THE CRIMES ON THE LIST WHATEVER IT WAS THIS LAST CHANCE IS STILL THERE FOR ANY ONE WHO WANTS TO TRY BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T EVENM KNOW ABOUT IT GERRALDS JOURNEY BEGAN WHERE ALL EPIC JOURNEYS BEGIN THE SUB COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE DU TO SHARRY B COMMITTEE GERALD WANTED TO BE THERE WHEN THEY

FRIENDS FROM THE HOUSE HORE HERE THIS MORNING AN WE HAVE THREE SUFFRAGE BILLS THAT AR BEFORE US AND THE AN HOL LES FON DOWN THE HALL WER COND ENOUGH TO COME DOWN AND ISIT WITH IS THEY WERE GINETTY CONSIDERING JUST THREE SUFFRAGE BILLS THE FIRST BILL CAME OUT OF I WASN'T GERRALDS THE SPONSER FROM THE HOUSE TALKED ABOUT IT AND THE OMMITTEE PASSED IT THEN ANOTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAME TO THE MICROPHONE SHE WAS THERE TO TALK ABOUT TWO OTHER BILLS AT TOHE MORNING COMMITTEE AND MAKING A CHARMIN FORROUND TO PRESENT ON BEHANT ONS LAND MAR AND MIS GRAND NEITHER BILL WAS GRRALDS HIS DID NOT EVEN COME OUT IT WAS DEAD  E LOOKED INTO IT AND THIS IS HOW IT GOES A LOT OT THE TIME THE HOUSE WILL PASS THE SUFFRAGE BILL BUT THEN FILLINGANE BLOCKSAND SO I PUT IN A REQUEST TO TALK TO HIM GARLD CALLD ME THE DAY AFTER HIS BILL AND I GET NA HOW YO YET YOR DAY BE GER OLR BET WHAT RIT A A   WITLL BE YOU KNOW  WI A WILL YO KNOW I YOU  WHAT IT IT COULD BE RIGHT ER WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT  JUST SAY I KNOW WELL I MEAN IT   BY WAY E  EAT I BA ILLY I YOU AY YOU KNOW IT AY AT A GERALD HAD NO IDEA WHY FILIN GANE KILLED HIS BILL WHY THESE OTHER PEOPLE MADE IT AND NOT HIM FILIN GAIN GOT BHACK TO ME AND WAS HAPPY TO TALK I MET HIM IT HIS LAW OFFICE HE'S A REAL ESTATE LER WHEN HE'S NOT AT THE CAPITAL I JUST FINISHE MY TWENTY THIRD YEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE I COMBINED HOW SENSE IN IT IN NEXT YEAR  WBE THE END OF THE SIX TERM SO I MEAN I'VE BEEN DONE IT FOR A LITTLE WHILE NOW I BROUGHT A COPY OF GERALD'S BILL WITH ME HIS DID PASS OUT OF THE HOUSE I'M AND THAN I DON'T THINK THAT SENAT COMMITTEE EVEN BROUGHT IT UP FOR DISCUSSION RIT I DON'T RECALL US BRINGING THAT ONE UP IN PROBABLY BECAUSE HIS DISTANT FRENCHISEIND PRIME WAS THAT OF ROBBERY WHICH JUST CONSIDERED A VIOLENT OFFENSE ROBBERY IS CLASSIFIED AS A VIOLENT OFFENCE IN MISSISSIPPI LAW IT DOESN'T MEAN THE CRIME ITSELF WAS NECESSARILY VIOLENT BUT FILIN GAN AS A GENERAL RULE DOESN'T CONSIDER ANY SUFFRAGE BILLS FOR VIOLENT CRIMES HE SAIS THATS WHITH THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR WHO PUT HIM ON THE COMMITTE TOLD HIM TO NO THAT'S WHY GRALD'S BILL AE BUT ULTIMATELY IT IS UP TO FILIN GAME HE CAN DO WHAT HE ONCE AND HE SAID HE DOES SOMETIMES AWAY INFORMATION THAT SWAYES HIM ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BUT THERE'S NO PART OF THIS PROSSESS SET ASIDE FOR PEOPLE TO COME TALK TO HIM IN THE COMMITTEE INTRODUCED THEMSELVES TELL THEIR STORY I TOLD HIM THAT GERALD'S CRIME WAS ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO AND THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE A GUN AT THE BANK FILINGANE SAID YES THOSE OF TE TIMES OF THINGS THAT COULD PERSUADE HIM IN THE COMITTEE BUT HE SAID HE LOOK AT O THER THINGS TOO FILLIN GAINSIDER MIGHT HURT SOME ONE LIKE GERALD IF THE POLICE HAD BEEN CALLED TO THEIR HOME OR IF THEY'D BEEN CONVICTED OF ANOTHER CRIME I WONDERED HOW FPHILLIN GANE FELT ABOUT ENFORCING THIS PARTICULAR PART OF MISSISSIPPI'S CONSTITUTION GIVEN HOW IT DISPROPORTIONALLY EFFECTS BLACK PEOPLE AND GIVEN ITS HISTORY THE HISTORIANS THAT I'VE TALK TO ABOUT THIS TO TRY TAT YOU KNOW LEARN MORE ABOUT IT SAID THAT YOU KNOW IT WAS TUS EIGHTEEN NINETY  CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION THAT MET AND THAT YOU KNOW THE GOAL OF THAT CONVENTION WAS TO KEEP BLACK PEOPLE FROM VOTING AND THAT THAT YOU KNOW THESE CRIMINAL DISENFRANCHISEMENT THESE LAWS WERE PART OF THAT THAT PLAN I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE CASE OR NOT I WASN'T THERE I'VE I'VE NOT STUDIED THE HISTORY OF THE EIGHTEEN INY CONSTITUTION AND CERTAINLY MISSISSIPPI HAS A VERY ACHECUERD PASS WHEN IT COMES TO I RACE RELATIONS WE TREATED AFTERNOMERICANS VERY POORLY IN IN A SOME PARTS OF OUR HISTORY AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT ET AS AT HEREING DEFIN THAT AR EVEN TROT TO I WOULDN'T WANT TO BUT IF YOURE ASKING ME IS THE SUFFRAGE RIGHT BEING TREATED DIFFERENTLY BASE ON YOUR RACE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO AS IT RELATES TO SUFFRAGE BILLS THAT WE CONSIDERING THE LEGISLATURE ABSOLUTELY NOT I DON'T KNOW E O THE RACE OF THE PERSON I'M SURE I COULD PROBABLY TRY TO FIND OUT BU ASKING TO PART WETCORRECTIONS TO PRINT ME AS SOCIAL HISTORY AND OF THE PRISONS AGE AND I IN A RAIEL BACKGROUND AND ALL THAT IF I WANTED TO I'VE NEVER DONE THAT I DON'T INTEND TO START BUT I MEAN IS NOT OBVIOUS TO ME JUST BI LOOKING AT HA BILL WHAT RACIEL BACKGROUND SOMEONES IS A PART OF I ASKED HIM ABOUT THIS RULE MORE BROADLY IF SOME ONE DOES THEIR TIME THE'R OUT OF PRISON OFF PAROLL YEARS HAVE PASSED WHY SHOLN'T THEY BE ALLOWED TO VOTE WHAT'S THE REASONING BEHIND THAT WELL I THINK AND NOT CERTAINLY WHAT I WOULD THINK TH IT WE AIN BUT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK I MEA I THINK AT' SOMEPOIN PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY HAS TO COME INTO IT AND YOU HAVE TO REALIZE IF I'M GOING TO BREAK THE SOCIAL CONTRACT AND COMMIT A VIOLENT CRIME OR MIST OF THESE ARE VALENT CRIMS THAT LEAD TO I'M JUST FROM FRENT TROUSING AN YOUR RIGHT TO TE HERE THERE AR PRICE ES TO PAY FOR THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN A GRAND SWELL OF PUBLIC SUPPORT TO CHANGE THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT OF OUR STATE CONSTITUTION AND NOT TO SAY THAT THERE WON'T BE IN THE FUTURE BUT CERTAINLY THERE HASN'T BEEN AS OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO OF COURSE THE THING ABOUT PUBLIC SUPPORT IS THAT THE PEOPLE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THIS PROVISION IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETY CONSTITUTION THEY CAN'T VOTE THIS HERE JUST FIVE PEOPLE GOT THER RIGHT TO VO BACK HICH IS PRETTY TYPICAL THIS HERE IT'S FOUR WOMEN IN ONE MAN I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THEM BECAUSE THIY CAN REATE THEM JUST WHAT'S ON THEIR SUFFRAGE BILLS TWO WERE CONVICTED OF FORGERY TWO OF THEM VESSELMENT AND ONE BURGLARY MOST OF THEM FINISHE THEIR SENTENCE IS BEFORE GERALD DID SOME OF THEM HADN' BEEN ABLE TO VOTE FOR DATCASES THERE'S A LOW SUIT IN THE FEDERAL COURTS TRYING TO ARGUE THAT THIS WHOLE PROSCESS FOR GETTNG THE RIGHT TO GO BACK AS ARBITRARY AND THEREFORE ON CONSTITUTIONAL TAS IN THE YOU ASK CONSTITUTION BUT ITSIN THE EARLY STAGES AND ANY RULING COL TAKE YEARS THE SHON BE THE WOMAN WHO HELPS GET A LOT OF THESE BILLS INTRODUCED TOLD ME SHE'S BASICALLY STOCK TRYING TO GET HIS MANY OF THEM THROUGH THE HOUSE IN SENATE AS SHE CAN ONE BY ONE USING THE VERY PROCESS SHE DOESN'T THING SHE EXIST IN THE FIRST PLACE JERALD TOLD ME FOR SURE HE WAS GOING TO TRY AGAIN HE STILL HAS THE COPY OF HIS BILL THAT DIDN'T PASS I E MI BET WILL AYO BERETE WI ER E PA TO MA YERER WEER I OM POTI POI TO WHARTER LIKELY PUTTE E A PO  E BE BEN MARGL WHY DO YOU PUT IT ON YOUR MER BUT WHAT E I H A E  PARGRY HE ARGRY E PAY A  IT MADE THAT OT A HOPT I MA E  BE HAV WAY THERE   A FEW MONTHS LATER WE TALKED AGAIN AND HE TOLD ME HE BEEN ARRESTED FOR COCANE POSSESSION HE DIDN'T HAVE TO TELL ME ABOUT IT BUT HE DID JUST VOLUNTEERED IT HE SAID HE WAS DRIVING A FRIEND WHAN THEY GOT PULLD OVER JERLD SAYS HIS FRIEND HAD THE COCANE THE POLICE REPORTS HAS BOTH OF THEM DID IN ANY CASE JERLD WAS ANGRY HIMSELF FOR HAVING GOTTEN INTO THAT STITUATION JRUG POSSESSION IS NOT A CRIME THAT'S ON THE LIST OF THINGS THAT WILL COST TO YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE HE WASN'T IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETY CONSTITUTION BUT BASE ON WHAT I LEARNED FROM SENATOR FILL AND GAIN GRALD'S ARREST MIGHT BE ENOUGH RESON TO KILL HIS BILL IF THE POINT OF PUTTING THIS IN THE CONSTITUTION WAS TO MAKE IT A LONG JOURNEY FOR PEOPLE LIKE GERALD IT'S WORKING JOHNNICOFFMAN IS IT SEEM TO PRODUCEER A CAMPSHIDE NANIA

YOU REMEMBER THE CRETIQE OFFERED BY A TEN YEAR OLD AT THEBEGINNING STODAYS PROGRAM ABOUT THE WAY WE SPELL THE NAME OF A CERTAIN FISH YES AY O AMMI WAN IT WOULD BE PRONOUNCE SELNEY BUT ITS SEEM LIKE WHY FAIR POINT THIS TA STORY IS ABOUT SEVEN DOING SOMETHING ABOUT AS LOGICAL AS THAT SPELLING TAKING A RIDICULOUS ROUTE TO GET WHERE THEY NEED TO GO AND BY THAT I MAN AT RIDICULOUS RUTE THAT IS DIFFEREN FROM THE NORMAL KIND OF RIDICULOUS RUTE THEY USUALLY TAKE JAMY WELL WENT TO CALIFORNIA TO SEE IT FOR HERSELF I HAVEN'T ABOVE AVERAGE ATTACHMEN TO SAMMON AND OBSESSION THAT BEGAN IN COLLEGE WHEN I TOOK A CLASS WITH SAMMANGOROO PETER MOYL HE'S FAMOUS AND SAMMON CIRCLES TRUST ME I THINK I WAS ATTRACTED TO THEIR APIC MIGRATION AND THE MACOB NATURE OF THEIR LIVES THEY'RE BORN WIGGLE ROUND IN A COLD STREAM MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE OTION THEN INSTINCTUALLY A GANSTALL ODDS RETURN TO THE PLACE OF THEIR BIRTH HURLING THEIR BODIES OF OUR WATER FALLS FLESH ROTING DODGING BARE CLAS SIMULTANEOUSLY THE CANG AS THEIR PUSHING TOWARDS THEIR EXACT NEC AN THEIR EXACT PORT STRIM TO LAY EGS AND LET THE CYCLE BEGAIN AGAIN IT'S LIKE THEIR DYING TO LIVE I MEAN THERE IS THIS WHOLE INDUSTRY OF NATURE DACUMANARIS SANARD ON DRAMATIZING THE SPECIES IN THEIR O TO SEY FILMS WHICH FEATURE THE SOUND OF REEGING WATER IN THE BACKGROUND WHILE A SERIOUS NARRATOR TO SCRIBES THEIR MAJESTY IT'S AGA SISTEN TENNOLLE FE TOIN MUF TO TOING TER DISON TO PUSHN I SO STRON BE NEVON E IT'S A STAPLE OF NATURE PORD BUT THE WORLD AS CHANGED THE CLIMATE HAS CHANGED THERE'S BEEN INCREASINGLY HAT TEMPERATURES FIRES DROWED POLLUTION AT MANY OF THE RIVERS SAMMON USE FOR THEIR MIGRATION HAVE RUN DRY ORE'VE BEEN BLOCKED BY DANS THAT'S WHY TO DAY AND CALIFORNIA MANY SAMMON FOLLOW A RATICLY DIFFERENT COURSE THEY MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE OSHAN NOT THROUGH RIVERS BUT INSIDE A FLEET OF TINKER TRUCKS WITH HUMAN DRIVERS OF THE WHELL WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT TRUCKING SAMMON IT SEEM SO TO STOBACK A COLD MECHANICAL PROCESS THE IDEA OF SAMMON STUCK IN TRAFFIC JUST MADE ME FEEL SAD LIKE NATURE HAD BEEN HIGHJAK BUT I WAS ALSO KIND OF CURIOUS I REALLY WANTED TO SEE THUS RUDE GOLBER TIN CANS AND RUBBER BANS AND BARMONAL HACK AND PERSON SO I DECIDED TO FOLLOW FIVE SILVER TRUCKS TRANSPORTNG ABOUT HALF A MILLION ADOLESCENT SAMMON ON A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILE DRIBES TO THE SAMMONSESCO BAY A MYGRATION THAT NO LONGER STARTS WITH THE SOUND OF BABBLING WATER IT'S GALLT A DIFFERENT SOUND LE ONE TEASDAY AFTERNOON I FOUND MYSELF AT THE MOGALUMNY RIVER FISHATCHRY STANDING IN FRONT OF A GAS POWERED MACHINE THAT LOOKED LIKE IT WOULD BE MORE AT HOME ON A CONSTRUCTION SITE THE HATCHRY IS ABOUT AN HOUR NORTH EAST OF MADESTO IN THE SENTRAL VALLEY IT'S RIRL AND ISOLATED AND SO HOT THE SUN IMMEDIATELY BARNS EVEN IN MAY MOCALUMNES SITS NEXT TO A RIVER THAT WAS ONE SNOWN FOR THRIVING SAMMON AND TROUT RUNS BUT WAS DAMNED AN THE SIXTIES TO OFFSET THE LOST WILD POPULATIONS THE STAPE BUILT O HATCHERY AND AF PARKING LOK CLOSE TO THE OLD STREAM BED I SHOULD SAY HATCRIES ARE CONTROVERSIAL THE FISH RAISED IN THEM ARE NOD AS PREPARED TO SURVIVE IN NATURE AND WHEN THEIRE RELEASE THEY BREED WITH NATIVE SAMMON COMPROMISING THE JEANE POOL THEREWRE PEOPLE WHO THINK WE SHOULDN'T HAVE HATCHERIES AT ALL BUT CALIFORNIAS HAD THEM FOR DECATES OT THIS POINT A REALLY LONG TIME  MOCOLUMNY IS NOT A MASSIVE OPERATION JUST A FEW BUNGALOS AND TWENTY CONCRETE TRENCHES PACKED WITH ADOLESCENT FISH WHEN I PULL UP I MEET THE GUY RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING THE SAMMON TO THE OSIONS BILLSMET THE HATCHRY MANAGR GREETS ME THEN WALKS ME OVER TO THE S MACHINE THAT SNOW SO CRITICAL TOE SAMMON MIGRATION WE TRY TO TALK OVER ITS ROAR WUT AN THER  E ROIABILLS A BIG BEARDA BERLY GUY AND IS SUSPENDERS ARE NOT JUST FORSHA  THEY HOLD UP GENES WHICH ARE TUCKED IN THE WATER PROOF BOOTS HE'SE INTRVERTED SEEMS A LITTLE GRUFF BUT THERE'S A TENDERNESS IN THE WAY HE TALKS ABOUT THE FISH IN FACT HE TELLS ME WHEN THESE FISH WORE JUST BORN TBABIES THE SIZE OF FINGER NAILS RIGGLING IN THE WATER HE WOULD SOMETIMES SLEEP AT THE HATCHRY OVER NIGHT HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEIR WATER WAS THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE THAT THE ELECTRICITY STAYED ON HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE OKAY IT'S COMFORTING TO KNOW SOME ONE WHO CARES IS AT THE HEART OF THIS OPERATION BILL GREW UP IN THE AREA A FISHERMAN HIS LIFE REVOLVES AROUND RAISING THESE ANIMALS FOR HARVES BUT HE RAREILY BY SALMON IN THE STORE SAYS HE CAN'T AFFORD AT HE ONLY EATS WHAT HE CATCHES HE MOUNTED THE MOVING PLATFORM OF THE CROWDER AND STARTED ON ON HIS JOB THE CROWDER HAS A METAL GREAT THAT THATS BELOW THE WATER ITPUSHES THE FISH EACH THE SIZE OF A HOT DOG TO ONE END OF THE RACEWAY THEN THERE SUCKED UP INTO A TO THAT CONNEC AT TO THE TOP OF HE TROP THE TWO WAS TRANSLUCEN AND I COULD SEE ALL THESE SALMON WOUSHING BY LIK DOCUMONS BEING TRANSPORTED AND A NOUMATIC TO I WONDER HOW THEY FELT IF THEY FELT WHAT DID THEY THINK OF THIS SUDDEN RUSH OF MOVEMEN THE DRAMATIC SHIFT IN THEIR ENBIRONMENT WONE MINUTE SHINING IN THE SUN THE NEXS DROP IN A BIG DARK TANKER THERE WAS NO WAY TO REALLY NOW AFTER BILL FILLED EACH TRUCK WITH RACKISH WATER AND FISH AND BAGS OF ICE TO MAINTAIN THE TEMPERATUR WE PULLED OUT OF THE HATCHERY GOO BABIA WE'RE ON THE ROAD ME END FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FISH AND IT'S BIER BILLS DRIVING AHEAD IN A PICKUP I FOLLOW BEHIND THE CARAVAN THE FIVE TRUCKS LOOK LIKE ANY OTHER FEWELL TANKERS YOU WOULD SEE ON THE HIGHWAY THEY BLUNDON SEAM LESSLAY YOU'D NEVER KNOW HOW MANY LIVES WERE SPEED AND BY IN TE LA NEXT DEO UT'S AMAZING IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THE FISH ARE TRAVELLING BY TRUCK BILL STILL BE ABLE TO TRACE THEIR WAY BACK TO THEIR BIRTHPLACE THE HAT CHERY THE FISH ARE IMPRINTED WITH HATCHERY WATER BILL TOLD MA SO IF THEY SURVIVE LONG ENOUGH AT SEA TO REACH SPOWNING AGE THEY CAN USE THEIR SENSE OF SMELL TO RE TURN TO HIM SWIMMING UP RIVERS TILL THER HAT THE STREAM BED BY THE HATCHER  UIT TAKES TWO AND A HALF HOURS  TILL THE TRUCKS FINALLY PULLIN TO THEIR DESTINATSION FORT BAKER NOTHING CAN HAPPEN UNTIL THE DET OF NIGHT BECAUSE OF THE SAMMONA RELEASE WHEN IT'S LIGHT OUT SEA GOLLS PELICHANS AND CORMERANS WILL CIRCLE DIVE AND SWALLOW AS MANY OF THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FISHAS THEY CAN IN FRONT OF US THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE FRAMES THE SAMMONTO SCO BAY WHICH GLIMMERS AGAINST THE SKY LINE THEY CAN'T GET VERY CLOSE TO THE WATER BECAUS THE PIERS E HISTORIC LAMBAR SO BILLS SATS UP A SHOOT WHICH EXTENDS ABOUT A HUNDRED FEET E CANEC A TRUCK TO THE EDGE OF THE PIER THEN THERE'S A TWENTY FOOT DROP FROM THE PIER TO THE BAY DARKNESS FINALLY CLOSES EN AND BILLS SIGNALS THAT IT'S TIME AS OBLIVIOUS TEANAGERS MAKE OUT AT THE END OF THE PIER A SLOW TRICKLE OF WATER DRIPS DOWN INTO THE BAY THEN A STEADY STREAM FLOWS WITH A FEW OF THE SMALL FISH THEN A CASCADE A RUSH ALL AT ONCSE CROWDED AND ALIVE THE SAMMON ARE FALLING IN A FLURRY TO THE BAY BHELOW CRASHING AGAINST THE WATER THEN MAKING SMALL WAVES OF THEIREON  IT'S CHAOTIC AND BEAUTIFALL BUT EVERYTHING ABOUT THAS TI BACDOP IT FEELS CREW AND KIND OF ROOD TO THE ANIMALS I FEEL LIKE WE DON'T EVEN DESERVE SALMON IF THIS IS THE WORLD WE'VE MADE BUT AT THE SAME TIME AND I HATE THAT I'M SANG THES IT'S NOT SO BAD I BLOD SAMMON AND I WANT THEN TO SURVIVE AN A FORG AND I HAVE SALMONING CALIFORNIA THIS MIGHT BE THE ONLY WAY BELL REPEATS THE PROCESS WITH EACH TRAK FOUR MORE TIMES A FEW FETSH FLOP ON THE

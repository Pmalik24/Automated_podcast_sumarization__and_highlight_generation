WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANLAPONCENS GU SCIENCE SCIENCE SPACE TO  FR I MAY DRUWHUBERMEN AND O'M OR PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHOMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE DISCUSSING SYLICIBON SYLICIBEN IS A SYCHODELIC MEANING IT MODIFIES THE SYCHE AND IN DOING SO IT CHANGES OUR LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS SYCHODELIC SUCH AS SYLISIBON CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE PERCEIVE THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN OUR INTERNAL WORLD OUR MEMORIES ARE THOUGHTS OR FEELINGS ET CETERA NOT JUST WHILE ONE IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SYLISIBON BUT IT CAN ALSO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE ALL OF THOSE THINGS AFTERWARDS AND FOR A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME AFTERWARDS AS WELL WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THERE'S GROWING EXSIPMENT ABOUT THE APPLICATION OF SYLICIBON ANOTHER PSYCHODELICS FOR THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SUCH AS DEPRESSION ALCOHOL ABUS DISORDER AND EDICTIONS OF VARIOUS KINDS AS WELL AS THINGS LIKE OCE D AND EATING DISORDERS TO DAY WE WILL DISCUSS SCYLICIBON TALKING ABOUT WHAT IT IS IN FACT YOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT SYLICIBON BASICALLY IS SERATONEN NOW FOR THOSE OF YOUTHEIR FAMILIAR A SYLISIBON AND SERATONIAN YOU MIGHT THINK WAIGT THAT'S NOT TRUE BUT IN FACT SYLICIBON'S MAIN EFFECT IS TO MIMIC SRATONEN BUT IT DOES IT IN A VERY SPECIFIC WAY BECAUSE IT ACTIVATES A SUBSET OF SERATONAN RECEPTORS IN A VERY STRONG FASHION LEADING TO NER PLASTICITY AT THE LEVEL OF THE NERL CIRCUITS THAT IS THE BRAINAREASM CONNECTIONS THAT SERVE THINGS LIKE MEMORY AND PERCEPTION SO IF ANY OF THAT IS CONFUSING AT THIS POINT I PROMISE TO MAKE IT ALL CLEAR IN JUST A FEW MINUTES SYLICIBEN IS ONE OF MANY SYCHODELICS OF COURSE THERARE THINGS LIKE ELIS D D M T FIVE M O D M T EVEN M D MA WHILE NOT CONSIDERED A CLASSIC SYCHODELIC IS CONSIDERED PSYCHODELIC IN THE GENERAL SENSE TODAY'S EPISODE IS GOING TO FOCUS ON SYLISIBON IN PARTICULAR I WILL TELL YOU WHAT SYLICIBON IS HOW IT WORKS AT THE MOLECULAR AND SELER LEVEL I'LL TALK ABOUT HOW IT CHANGES BRAIN CIRCUITRY I'LL TALK ABOUT THE CLINICAL EFFECTS WHAT'S BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN CONTROLLE LABORATORY STUDIES I'LL TALK ABOUT DOSAGES AND TRANSLATING FROM SYLISIBON MUSHROOMS TO ACTUAL SYLISIBON AND THE COMPOUND THAT ACTUALLY EXERTS THE EFFECTS OF SYLISIBON WHICH IT TURNS OUT IS NOT SYLISIBON BUT SOMETHING CALLED SILISON SILISON IS THE ACTUAL COMPOUND THAT GOES INTO THE BRAIN TO CREATE ALL THE CHANGES IN CONSCIOUSNESS AND ALL THE REWIRING EFFECTS THAT WE ASSOCIATE WITH SYLISIBON SO UNDERSTANDING HOW SYLISIBON AS CONVERTED TO SILISON HAS TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE DURATION OF A SYLISIBON JOURNEY WHETHER OR NOT THAT SYLISIBON JOURNEY IS GOING TO LEAD TO A SHORT OR LONGER WINDOW FOR NURAL PLASTICITY IN FACT MANY PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THIS BUT MUCH OF THE POSITIVE CHANGES THAT ARE POSSIBLE WITH PROPER AND I DO ONE UNDERSCORE PROPER SYLISIBON THEIR REPEUTIC APPROACHES TAKES PLACE AFTER THE SESSION IN WHICH ONE FEELS ALL THE YOU KNOW TYPICAL OR TYPICALLY ASSOCIATE EFFECTS OF SYLISIBON LIKE CALLUCINATIONS AND CHANGES IN THOUT PATTERNS ET CETERA SO TODAY WE ARE GONG TO TALK ELOBIT ABOUT CHEMISTRY BUT I PROMISE TO MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT YOU HAVE A BACKGROUND IN CHEMISTRY OR BIOLOGY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME SELBIOLOGY THE ACTUAL NURNAL CHANGES THAT OCCUR WHEN ONE TAKES SYLISIBON AND WE'RE GING TO TALK ABOUT HOW NURALCIRCUITS CHANGE OVER TIME AND HOW ALL OF THAT IMPACTS THE CHANGES THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN WHEN THEY GO ON A SYLISIBON JOURNEY THINGS SUCH AS LONGSTANDING IMPROVEMENTS IN MOOD THINGS SUCH AS TREMENDOUS INSITE INTO THEMSELVES INTO OTHERS INTO THEIR PASS THEIR PRESENT IN THEIR FUTURE AND EVEN CHANGES IN THEIR LEVELS OF CREATIVITY OR THEIR ABILITY TO EXPERIENCE JOY FROM MUSIC OR THEIR ABILITY TO DISSOCIATE IN A POSITIVE WAY FROM THINGS THAT FORMERLY WERE DEPRESSING OR TRIGGERS FOR DEPRESSION IN FACT WE'RE GOING TO TALK QUITE A LOT ABOUT THE CONDITIONS INSIDE OF A SYLISIBON JOURNEY THAT MAKE IT ACTUALLY P POSITIVE AND THERAPEUTIC THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT THAT I'LL MAKE SEVERAL TIMES THROUGHOUT TO DAY'S EPISODE WHICH IS THAT JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IN VOKES NERL PLASTICITY CHANGES IN BRAIN CIRCUITRY DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT'S THERAPEUTIC OR I SHOULD SAY IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT IT'S THERAPEUTIC FOR NEURL PLASTICITY TO BE THERAPEUTIC IT HAS TO BE ADAPTIVE IT HAS TO ALLOW SOMEONE TO FUNCTION BETTER IN LIFE THAN THEY DID PREVIOUSLY SO TO DAY WE WILL TALK ABOUT HOW THE CONDITIONS OF A SYLIIBON JOURNEY INCLUDING WHETHE OR NOT IT'S DONE WITH EYES CLOSED OR EYES OPEN OR WHETHER NOT PEOPLE ALTERNATE BETWEEN EYES CLOSED AND EYES OPEN PHASES OF THAT JOURNEY AS WELL AS WHETHER NOT MUSIC IS PLAY DURING THAT JOURNEY AND EVEN WHAT TYPES OF MUSIC ARE PLAYED WILL DICTATE WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY WILL FEEL BETTER OR WORSE IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AND YEARS FOLLOWING THAT SCYLICIBON JOURNEY AS WELL AS THE DOSAGE LEVEL BECAUSE AS YOU'LL SOON LEARN AS WELL THERE ARE CLINICAL STUDIES SHOWING THAT JUST ONE SYLIIBON JOURNEY CAN IMPROVE MOOD IN A LONGSTANDING WAY BUT MOST CLINICAL TRIALS INVOLVE TWO DOSAGES SPACED IN VERY PRECISE WAYS FROM ONE ANOTHER WITH APPROPRIATE FOLLOW UP BUT IN BOTH OF THOSE PARTICULAR JOURNEYS THE STRUCTURE OF THE JOURNEY WHOSE PRESENT WHO'S NOT PRESENT EYES OPEN OR EYES CLOSED THE PARTICULAR MUSIC THAT'S PLAYED ALL OF THOSE FEATURES MAKE UP PART OF A LARGER NEURL PLASTICITY TRIGGER OF WHICH SYLICIBON IS CRITICAL BUT SYLICIBON IS NOT THE ONLY VARIABLE SO WHETHEROR NOT YOUR INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN A CLITICAL STUDY OR WHETHEROR NOT YOUR INTERESTED IN SCYLICIBON FOR OTHER REASONS THIS IS CRITICAL INFORMATION TO UNDERSTAND SO TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT NEARLY EVERY FEATURE OF SYLICIBON POSSIBLE INCLUDING WHAT SYLICIBON IS HOW IT WORKS AT THE LEVEL OF CHEMISTRY SELBIOLOGY AND NEURAL NETWORKS AND NEURAL PLASTICITY WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE CLINICAL STUDIES WILL TALK ABOUT DOSAGES WE WILL TALK ABOUT CONDITIONS OF CLINICAL STUDIES AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE POST SYLICIBON JOURNEY PERIOD IN WHICH NEUR PL ASTICITY AND THE VARIOUS ACTIVITIES INCLUDING THERAPY OR PERHAPS NOT THERAPY CON CONTRIBUTE TO POSITIVE THERAPEUTIC CHANGES FROM SYLISIBON NOW AS WE GO INTO THIS DISCUSSION I DO WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE FACT THAT AT THE TIME OF RECORDING THIS EPISODE MEANING NOW MAY TWENTY TWENTY THREE SYLISIBON IS STILL A SCHEDUALE ONE DRUGGET IS CONSIDERED ELEGAL IN THE UNITED STATES IS PERHAPS JUST ONE EXCEPTION TO THAT MAY BE A FEW OTHERS BUT THE MAIN EXCEPTION IS IN THE STATE OF OREGON SYLISIBON HAS BEEN APPROVED IN PARTICULAR THERAPEUTIC SADINGS FOR USE IN PARTICULAR CONDITIONS NAMELY DEPRESSION AND SOME FORMS OF EDICTION SO IN OREGON IT'S MORE O LESS IN THE DOMAIN OF DECRIMINALIZED AS OPPOSED TO ACTUALLY LEGAL IN OTHER AIRS OF THE COUNTRY INCLUDING OKLAN CALIFORNIA THEIR SOME AREAS IN WHICH IT HAS BEEN DECRIMINALIZED AND PERHAPS THERE A FEW OTHERS THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF BUT IN GENERAL SYLISIBON AND OTHER PSYCHODELICS ARE STILL CONSIDERED ELEGALNISS IS VERY IMPORTANT NOT JUST SAYING THAT TO PROTECT ME I'M SAYING THATS TO PROTECT YOU POSSESSING OR CERTAINLY SELLING SYLISIBON EXCEPT FOR RARE INSTANCES SUCH AS CLINICAL STUDIES AND THESE A DECRIMINALIZED AREAS THAT TALKED ABOUT A MOMENT AGO IS STILL VERY MUCH NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE LAW TODAY I'LL ALSO DISCUSS SAFETY ISSUES I'LL TALK ABOUT WETHER NOT YOUNG PEOPLE MEANING PEOPLE TWENTY FIVE OR YOUNGER SHOULD CONSIDER SYLISIBON GIVEN THAT THEIR BRAIN IS STILL IN A RAMPANT PERIOD OF NATURALLY OCCURRING NORAL PLASTICITY I WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT DOSAGES AS IT RELATES TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE FORMERLY BEEN ON ORT MAY CURRENTLY BEYOND DIFFERENT FORMS OF ANTIDOPRESSENCE AND I WILL TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE AT RISK FOR PSYCHOTIC EPISODES EITHER BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY THEMSELVES HAVE A PROPENSITY FOR PSYCHOSIS OR THEY HAVE CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAVE PSYCHOSIS WHICH INCLUDES THING LY SCHYSOPHRENIA BY POLAR DEPRESSION AS WELL AS THINGS LIKE BORDERLINE PERSONALITY AND SOME RELATED PSYCHEATRIC CONDITIONS SO TO DAY'S T EPISODE REALLY WILL BE A DEEP DIVE INTO SYLICIBON SO WHETHER NOT YOU THINK YOU'RE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH SYLISIBON AND ITS EFFECTS OR WHETHER NOT YOU'RE JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THEM I DO ENCOURAGE IF YOU'RE WILLING TO TRY AND RATCH IT THROUGH SOME OF THE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW SYLICIBAN WORKS AND WHAT IT IS LEADING UP TO SOME OF THE THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS AND DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF DOSING SPACING OF DIFFERENT CESSIONS ET CETERA CAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE IN HAND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE FAR BETTER MUCH MORE IN FORM DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER NOT SYLICIBON IS RIGTE FOR YOU BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE EMPHASIZE OF THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AN RESEARCH ROLLS ET STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSERS OF TODAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR NOW SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLYTES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLITE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHISITES IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACKTOELECTROLITE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT'S ONE GRAM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDER MILIGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'VE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT ELEEMENT DOC COM SLASH HUBERMEN LET'S TALK ABOUT SYLISIBEN AND AGAIN TO DAY WE'RE GOING TO PFOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON SYLISIBON AND WE'RE GOING TO SET ASIDE ALL THE OTHER SYCHODELICS FOR FUTURE EPISODES SILICIVEN IS WHAT'S CALLED A TRIP DEMIN THAT REFERS TO ITS CHEMICAL COMPOSITION NOT TO THE SO CALLED SYCHODELIC TRIP IN FACT IT SPELLED DIFFERENTLY TRIP DOMIN AS T RWI P TRIP T R IP OF COURSE TRIP DEMEANS INCLUDE SILISIVEN BUT ALSO THINGS LIKE D M T AND FIVE M I O D M T THE TRIP DEMEAN SYCHODELICS VERY CLOSELY RESEMBLE SERATONAN ITSELF THAT'S RIGHT MOST OF YOU A E PROBABLY HEARD OF THE CHEMICAL SRATONAN AND SERATONAN IS WHAT'S CALLED A NEROMODULATOR WHICH MEANS YOUR BRAIN ENBODY NATURALLY MAKE IT AND THAT IT MODIFIES OR CHANGES THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER NURANS AND NURAL CIRCUITS AND IT DOES THAT GENERALLY BY EITHER INCREASING OR DECREASING THE ACTIVITY OF THOSE NERAL CIRCUITS IF I WERE TO SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF THE CHEMICAL STRUCTURE OF SILIIVON OR ITS ACTIVE DERIVITIVE SILISON AND I WERE TO ALSO PUT RIGHT ALONGSIDE IT AN IMAGE OF THE CHEMICAL STRUCTURE OF SERATONAN PROVIDED TAT YOU WEREN'T A CHEMIST WHO REALLY LIKES TO FOCUS ON THE DETAILED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THINGS YOU WOULD SAY THOSE LOOK VERY SIMILAR AND INDEED SCYLICIVEN AND ITS ACTIVE FORM SILISON ARE VERY SIMILAR STRUCTURALLY AND CHEMICALLY TO SARATONAN ITSELF NOW AS I MENTION BEFORE SERATONAN IS SOMETHING THAT YOU NATURALLY MAKE AND YES IT'S TRUE THAT ABOUT NINETY PER CENT OF THE SERATONAN IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY IS MANUFACTURED IN YOUR GUT HOWEVER CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF THE SERATONAN IN YOUR BRAIN IS NOT MANUFACTURED FROM THE SERATONAN IN YOUR GUT YOU HAVE SEPARATE INDEPENDENT SOURCES OF SERATONAN THAT IS YOU HAVE PARTICULAR NURONS THAT MAKE SERATONAN IN YOUR BRAIN YOU ALSO HAVE SARATONAN IN YOUR GOT AND THOSE WORK MORE LESSIN PARALLEL SEPARATELY NOW WHAT A SERATONAN DO THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE OF THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN SCYLISIVON AND ITS ACTIVE FORM SILISON AND SERATONAN SERATONAN IN THAT IT'S A NUREMODULATOR CHANGES THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER NURONS AND THE NET EFFECTS OF THOSE CHANGES ARE THINGS THAT YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH FOR INSTANCE SETIETY OR THE FEELING THAT WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF VARIOUS THINGSSUCH AS FOOD OR A SOCIAL INTERACTION OR SECTS OR PLEASURE OF ANY KIND SRATONAN IS INVOLVED IN ALL OF THAT AND AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS SUCH AS MOOD REGULATION SUCH AS OUR SENSE OF PLEASURE ITSELF WER LACK OF PLEASURE SUCH AS WHETHER NOT WE FEEL MOTIVATED OR NOT MOTIVATED IT WORKS IN CONCERT WITH OTHER NURYMODULATORS SUCH AS DOPOMINE AND EPINEPHERAN IN NORUPINEPHRAN IN FACT IF THIS WERE AN EPISODE ABOUT SERATONAN WHICH IT IS NOT YOU WOULD SOON REALIZE THAT SERATONAN IS INVOLVED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS THAT IMPACT OUR DAILY LIFE AND THAT IS ONE REASON WHY CERTAIN ANTI DEPRESSENT MEDICATIONS WHICH ALTER EITHER INCREASE OR DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF SERATONAN TRANSMISSION IN THE BRAIN WILL OFTEN HAVE A LOT OF SIDE EFFECTS RELATED TO THINGS LIKE MOOD LEBEDO APPETITE SLEEP ET CETERA IT'S BECAUSE SERATONA IS INVOLVED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS AND SERATONAN IS INVOLVED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS BECAUSE THERE ARE LOT OF DIFFERENT SO CALLED SARATONAN RECEPTORS SERATONA IS A CHEMICAL THAT WE CALL ALIGAND AND THE CHEMICAL LIGEND IS SIMPLY THE THING THAT PLUGS INTO THE RECEPTR FOR THAT CHEMICAL OR LIGAN THE RECEPTERS NHIS CASE SERATONAN RECEPTORS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS THEY CAN CHANGE THE ACTIVITY OF NURONS MAKING THE MORE ACTIVE OR LESS ACTIVE THEY CAN CAUSE GROWTH FACTORS TO BE RELEASED MAKING SURE THAT THOSE NURONS REINFORCE ORE EVEN BUILD UP STRONGER CONNECTIONS SO THAT THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE ACTIVE IN THE FUTURE SERATONIN BINDING TO PARTICULAR RECEPTORS CAN EVEN CHANGE THE GENE EXPRESSION IN PARTICULAR CELLS MAKING THOSE CELLS PROLIFERATE O SOMMICE MORE OF THEM MAKING THOSE CELLS MORE ROBOSD MAKING THOSE CELLS A INTERACT WITH NEW ELEMENTS OF THE BRAIN EMBODY BASICALLY SERATONAN AND A LL THESE DIFFERENT RECEPTORS THAT IT BINDS TO HAS DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS AND MAYBE EVEN THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS SO THE FACT THAT SYLICIBON SO CLOSELY RESEMBLES SERATONAN LEADS TO A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE ASKING OURSELVES WHICH IS WHY IS IT THAT SYLICIBON WHICH LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE CERATONAN WHEN ONE TAKES IT IN THE FORM OF MAGIC MUSHROOMS OR SOME OTHER FORM MAY BE THE SYNTHETIC FORM OF SCYLICBON ITSELF WHICH NOWADAYS MANUFACTURED IN LABORATORIES AND PLACED IN DIFFERENT SCYLICIBON CONTAINING FOODS AND PILLS ET CETERA WHY THAT LEADS TO COMPLEX YET FAIRLY CIRCUMSCRIBED SETS OF EXPERIENCE LIKE VISUAL AND AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS CHANGES IN PARTICULAR THOUGHT PATTERNS AND NEUROPLASTICITY THAT IN MANY CASES IN THE CLINICAL SITIN PROVIDED THINGS ARE DONE CORRECTLY IMPROVEMENTS IN MOOD RELIEF FROM DEPRESSION RELIEF FROM VARIOUS COMPULSIVE DISORDERS ET CETERA THIS IS REALLY WHAT YOU NEED T UNDERSTAND IF YOU WANT UNDERSTAND SYLICIBON AND HOW IT WORKS AND HOW TO MAKE IT WORK OPTIMALLY FOR A GIVEN CONDITION OR GOAL YO EFT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S ACTUALLY DOING AND WHAT ALLOWS SCYLICIBON TO DO FAIRLY SPECIFIC THINGS IN COMPARISON TO SERATONAN EVEN THOUGH SCYLICIBON AND SERATONAN ARE SO SIMILAR IS THAT SYLICIBON MAINLY BINDS TO AN ACTIVATES THE SO CALLED SERATONAN TO A RECEPTER THE SERATONAN TO A RECEPTER IS ONE OF AGAIN MANY DIFFERENT CERATONAN RECEPTERS BUT SERATONAN TO A IS EXPRESSED IN PARTICULAR AREAS OF THE BRAIN AND EVEN ON PARTICULAR AREAS OF NURONS IN THE BRAIN THAT ALLOW FOR VERY SPECIFIC TYPES OF CHANGES IN NEURAL CIRCUITRY TO TAKE PLACE NOT JUST WHEN ONE IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SYLICIBON BUT AFTERWARDS AS WELL SO REALLY IN ORDER TO HAVE A USEFUL DISCUSSION ABOUT SYLICIBON WE NEED TO TALK A LOT ABOUT THE SCERATONAN TO A RECEPTER BUT UNDFORTUNATELY FOR YOU UNLESS YOU'RE SOMEBODY RELY INTERESTED IN STRUCTURAL BY AL LOGY OR SELBIOLOGY THAT DISCUSSION IS NOT GOING TO BE ABOUT THE BINDING POCKET FOR SCERATONAN ON CAERATONE INTO A RECEPTOR ORE A LOT OF THE DOWNSTREAM SIGNALLING OF THE CERATONE INTO A RECEPTOR WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT WHERE IT'S RELEVAN BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY AT LEAST FOR SAKE OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE SERATONAN TO A RECEPTOR IS REALLY THE ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRIGURING ALL THE CHANGES IN NERAL CIRCUITRY THAT LEAD TO THE CHANGES THAT IS THE IMPROVEMENTS IN MOOD THE RELIEF FROM COMPULSIVE DISORDERS IN MANY CASE BUT REALLY IT'S THE SERATONAN TOA RECEPTOR SELECTIVITY OF SYLISIBEN THAT IS LEADING TO ALL THE EXCITEMENT THAT YOU HER ABOUT IN TERMS OF SILISIBON AS A TERAPEUTIC TOOL WE SAY THAT FROM A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ANGLE THERE ARE DATA THAT I'LL TALK ABOUT TODAY WHICH SHOW THAT ONE ALTHOUGH IN MOST CASES TO SYLICIBON JOURNEYS DONE WITH PARTICULAR DOSAGES OF SYLISIBON LEAD TO MAXIMAL BINDING OR OCCUPANCY OF THOSE CERATONAN TO A RECEPTORS IN WAYS THAT LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT AND UNPRECEDENTED RELIEF FOR MAJOR DEPRESSION IN FACT YOU'LL SOON LEARN THAT THE CLINICAL TRIALS FOR SYLISIBOEN ARE OUT PERFORMING STANDARD THERAPY AND OUT PERFORMING SO CALL ESESS ORIE AND VARIOUS OTHER ANTEDOPRESSENCE AND TERMS OF PROVIDING DEPRESSION RELIEF IN WAYS THAT ARE FRANKLY STAGGERING NOT JUST TO ME BUT TO THE SYCHIATRIC COMMUNITY AT LARGE AND THIS IS WHAT ARE SO MUCH THE EXCITEMENT IS COMING FROM NOW THAT STATEMENT COULD BE TAKEN ONE WAY WHICH IS TO JUST SAY OKEWELL HERE'S A COMPOUND SILISIBON THAT OUT PERFORMS AS A SARISE AND THEREFORE ALL THE ATTENTION SHOULD BE ON SILISIBON BUT S S R I STANDS FOR SELECTIVE SERATONAN REUPTAKE IN HIBITOR IN OTHER WORDS THE ESCESSORIYES OF WHICH THERE IS NOW A LOT OF CONTROVERSY THINGS LIKE PROSAC SO LOFT ET CETERA I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THIS CONTROVERSY THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY PROESSESSORISAL THOUGH THERE ARE GROWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO REALLY FEEL THAT THE ESCESSORISE ARE PROBABLY MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THINGS LIKE OF SESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER WHERE THEY IN FACT CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL BUT THERE IS A LOT OF AM KIND OF LEANING BACK FROM ESSESS ORIES AS THE BE ALL END ALL FOR THE TREATMEN OF DEPRESSION NOWADAYS BECAUSE OF THE CIDEFECT PROFILES AND THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT EVEN REALLY CLEAR THAT SERATONAN DEFICIENCIES ARE THE MAJOR CAUSE OF DEPRESSION IN THE FIRST PLACE NOW AGAIN WE'RE TIME ABOUT SYLICIBE AND NOT ABOUT ESSESS ORISE BUT YOU SHOULD BE THINKING WAIT HOW IS IT THAT TWO MOLECULES SILICIBEN AND SOME PARTICULAR ESSESS OR BOTH OF WHICH LOOK LIKE AND OR INCREASE CERATONAN TRANSMISSION IN THE BRAIN ARE LEADING TO EITHER INCREDIBLY POSITIVE AND INTERESTING OUTCOMES OR TO KIND OF TROUBLING SIDE EFFECT RIDDLED OUTCOMES AND AGAIN IT ALL BOILS BACK DOWN TO THE SELECTIVITY OF SYLICIBON TO BIND THAT CERATONEAN TO A RECEPTOR AND SO IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HOW SILICIBON WORKS AND IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND PROPER DOSING PROFILES AN SPACING OF SESSIONS ACA JOURNEYS WE REALLY NEEDS TO TALK A LITTL BIT MORE ABOUT THE CERATONEAN TO A RECEPTOR WHERE IT IS IN THE BRAIN WHAT SORTS OF THINGS HAPPEN WHEN SYLIIBEN BINDS THE SERATONAN TO A RECEPTOR AND HOW THOSE THINGS SET IN MOTION THE VARIOUS CHANGES THE NARROL PLASTICITY THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO FEEL BETTER IN TERMS OF THEIR MOOD AND AS YOU'LL SOON LEARN CAN EXPERIENCE MORE PLEASURE AN JOY FROM THINGS LIKE MUSIC AND ENHANCED CREATIVITY ALL THE THINGS THAT I DO BELIEVE WHETHER NOT PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT OR MAY BE VEN EXPLORING SYLICIBEN FOR RECREATIONAL OR THERAPEUTIC PURPOSES ALL THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE WANT AND ARE REALLY TALKING ABOUT AND PERHAPS EVEN DOING SYLICIBEN IN ORDER TO OBTAIN SO BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER I JUST WANT OF PLACED AN IMAGE IN YOUR MIND YOU CAN PLACE AN IMAGE IN YOUR MIND WHEREBI WHEN CERATONAN IS RELEASED IN THE BRAIN NATURALLY NOT HAVING TAKEN ANY COMPOUND ANY DRUG ANYTHING IT' GAING RELEASE AT LOT DIFFERENT SITES BINDING TO A LOT OF DIFFERENCE ARETONE AND RECEPTORS DOING A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS WHEN SOMEBODY TAKES AN ESSESSR THE NET OF F CT OF THAT SELECTIVE SERATONAN REUPTAKEN HIBITER IS THAT THERE'S MORE SERATONAN AROUND TO EXERT ITS EFFECTS BECAUSE IT'S A REUPTAKEN HIBITER AT THE SYNAPS THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN YOUR OWNS THE SERATONAN CAN DO ITS THING MORE EXTENSIVELY AND FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME BUT IT'S DOING KIND OF NON SPECIFICALLY SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT STANDARD ANTI DEPRESSENT TREATMENTS IT LEAST FOR SAKE OF THIS DISCUSSION YOU CAN I THINK OF A SPRINKLING OR A KIND OF A YOU KNOW SPRAYING OF SERATONAN AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN THE BRAIN AND BINDING TO LOTS OF DIFFERENT RECEPTORS WHEREAS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT SYLICIBAN EVEN THOUGH THE SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS ARE PRETTY DIVERSE WELL TALK ABOUT THOSE IN A FEW MOMENTS WHAT YOU'REREALLY TALKING ABOUT IS A MOLECULE SYLICIBON THAT LOOKS A LOT LIKE SERATONAN THAT IS SELECTIVELY AND VERY STRONGLY BINDING TO ENACTIVATING THAT SARATONAN TO A RECEPTOR SO THAT'S THE IMAGE ID LIKE YOU TO IMBED IN YOUR MIND AND THEN THE NEXT IMAGE I LIKE YOU TO IMBED IN YOUR MIND IS WERE THESE SERATONAN TO A RECEPTORS ARE LOCATED IN THE BRAIN NOW THE SERETONAN TO A RECEPTORS ARE LOCATED IMMOLTABLE BRAIN REGIONS BUT THEY HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EXPRESSION IN THE SO CALLED NEO QUARTECS THE OUTSIDE OF THE BRAIN THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE OUR PREFONTAL QUARTECTS WHICH IS INVOLVED IN UNDERSTANDING CONTEXT WHICH BEHAVIORS THOUGHTS AND SPEECH PATTERNS ARE APPROPRIATE FOR CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES UM HOW TO SWHICH CONTEXT AND CATEGORY SWITCH WHEN YOU GO FROM YOU DON'T PLAYING SPORTS TO HANG OUT WITH FRIENDS TO BEING IN A PROFESSIONAL SETTING YOU CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR IN THE WAY THAT YOU SPEAK AND PERHAPS EVEN THE WAY THAT YOU THINK YOU MIGHT THINKS THEM THINGS THAT ARE OUT OF CONTECTS BE PROBABLY KEEP THOSE TO YOURSELF AND YOUR ABILLY TO KEEP THOSE TO YOURSELF ARE DEPENDENT ON A FUNCTIONAL PREFRONTAL QUARTEX THERE'RE A LOT OF FIVE H T TO A AND BY THE WAY FIVE H T IS THE ABBREVIATION FOR SERATONAN SO THERE A LOT OF SERATONINTO A RECEPTORS IN THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX ALSO IN OTHER AREAS OF THE QUARTEX THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SENSATION AND PERCEPTION THAT IS HEARING OF SOUNDS THAT IS SEEING OF PARTIC LAR THINGS AND IN PARTICULAR THERE IS A VERY VERY VERY HIGH EXPRESSION OF SERATONE INTO A RECEPTORS IN THE VISUAL QUARTAX AND THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY SYLISIBON TRIGGERS VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS AND PROVIDED SYLICIBON IS PRESENT AT SUFFICIENT ENOUGH CONCENTRATION THAT IS TAKEN AT A SUFFICIENT DOSAGE ONE WILL EXPERIENCE PROFOUND VISUAL HLLUCINATIONS REGARDLESS OF WEATHER OR NOT THEIR EYES ARE OPEN WHERE THEIR EYES ARE CLOSED NOW THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FACT BECAUSE IT EXPLAINS ONE OF THE MAJOR EFFECTS OF SCYLISIBON THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE WHILE THEY ARE ON THE DRUG NOW AS HA'LL TALK ABOUT A LIOBIT LATER IN TERMS OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A USEFUL SCYLICIBON SESSION USEFUL MEANING THAT ITS LEADING TO ADAPTIVE IMPROVEMENTS AND MOOD ADAPTIV IMPROVEMENTS IND CREATIVITY AND COGNITION ET CETERA IS THAT PEOPLE NOT HAVE THEIR EYES OPEN FOR AT LEAST THE MAJORITY OF THE SCYLICIBON SESSION THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVE DISCUSSED WITH SEVERAL EXPERTS WHO ARE RUNNING CLINICAL STUDIES ON SCYLIIBON IN THEIR LABORATORIES SOME OF WHOM ARE GOING TO BE GUESS ON THE HUVRAM LABPOTCASED IN UPCOMING EPISODES NAND I CAN'T UNDERSCORE THIS ENOUGH BECAUSE YOUR VISUAL QUARTECS CONTAIN SO MANY OF THESE SERATONE NTO A RECEPTORS AND BECAUSE SCYLISIBON BINDS SO STRONGLY TO THAT SAERATONE INTO A RECEPTOR YOUR GOING TO EXPERIENCE A LOT OF VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS WHEN YOU ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SYLISIBON S NO SURPRISE THERE THIS HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF YEARS IT'S ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WHY PEOPLE TAKE SYLISIBON HOWEVER AS I MENTION EARLIER THESE HALLUCINATIONS OCCUR EVEN WHEN THE EYES ARE CLOSED AND IT'S NOW FAIRLY WELL ESTABLISHED THAT IF PEOPLE ARE TO TAKE SYLISIBON AND HAVE THEIR EYES OPEN MUCH OF THEIR COGNITION MUCH OF THEIR THINKING MUCH OF THE TIMES SPENT IN THAT SCYLISIBON JOURNEY IS FOCUST ON THE ALTERED PERCEPTIONS OF THINGS N THE OUTSIDE ENVIRONMENT SOMETIMES THIS LOOKS LIKE A A SORT OF A FRACTURING OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD INTO KIND OF A GEOMETRIC SHAPES SOMETIMES IT APPEARS AS A KIND OF MELTING OF THINGS IN THE VISUAL VIREMEN INCLUDING PEOPLE'S FACES OR A MORPHING OF PEOPLE'S FACES ALL OF THAT HAS A STRONG AND LET'S JUST CALL IT A DRAW FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A HIGHLY UNUSUAL EXPERIENCE INSIDE OF ON THE SCILICIBAN JOURNEY BUT THINK IF ONE'S GOAL IS TO DERIVE THE LONGLASTING BENEFIT FROM THE SILICIBEN EXPERIENCE IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT HAVING AN EYEMASK OR SOME OTHER EYE COVERING ORE SOMETHING THAT INSURES THAT ONE'S EYES ARE CLOSED FOR THE MAJORITY IF NOT THE ENTIRE SILICIBE AN SESSION IS GOING TO BE VERY USEFUL BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO LIMIT THE EXTENT TO WHICH ONE IS FOCUSSED ON THOSE OUTSIDE CHANGES IN VISUAL PERCEPTION ACH A HALLUCINATIONS AND RATHER WILL ALLOW THE PERSON TO GO INWARD TO COMBINE WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY HAPPEN TO BE SEENG IN THEIR MINDS EYE WITH THE DIFFERENT THOUGHTS AND MEMORIES AND CHANGES IN THEIR EMOTIONS THAT ARE OCCURRING AND THAT GOING INWARD BY STAYING IN THE EYEMASK AT LEAST FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME SEEMS TO BE A VERY IF NOT THE CRITICAL FEATURE OF MAKING THE SILICIBON JOURNEY EFFECTIVE IN THE THERAPUTIC SENSE NOW ONCE AGAIN I WANT ACUE TO SOME OF THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS HERE GOINGTO SAY THIS AT LEAST THREE TIMES THROUGHOUT TO DAY'S EPISODE AS I'M TALKING NOW AND VARIOUS OTHER TIMES THROUGHOUT TODAY'S EPISODE YOU MAY GET THE IMPRESSION THAT I'M ALL FOR EVERYBODY DOING SYLLISIBEN AND THAT IS SIMPLY NOT THE CASE IN ORDER FOR SCYLICIBON JOURNEY TO BE THERAPEUTICALLY USEFUL IT DOES REQUIRE CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND SUPPORTS AND THERE ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE FOR WHICH SYLICIBEN USE IS GOING TO BE CONTRAINDICATED MEANING THEY SHOULD NOT DO SYLICIBON IN PARTICULAR PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXISTING OR HAVE A PREDISPOSITION TO SYCOTIC EPISODES OR BY POLAR EPISODES EVEN HAVING A FIRST RELATIVE WHO HA AS BY POLAR OR SKETSOPHRENIC OR SKITS OF TYPLE ISSUES CAN BE A RULE OUT CONDITION THAT IS CAN GET SOME ONE ELIMINATED FROM A CLINICAL STUDY ON SYLICIVON FOR FEAR OF TRIGGERING SYCOTIC EPISODES NOT JUST CURING THE SCYLICIVAN GERMANY BUT POTENTIALLY IN A LONG STANDING WAY SO AGAIN THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL THE OTHERTHING IS THAT EVERYTHING OME TALKING ABOUT TO DAY UNLESS I SAY OTHERWISE IS REALLY FOCUSET ON ADULTS MEANING PEOPLE WHO ARE TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD OR OLDER THAT IS THEIR BASIC WIRING AND REWIRING OF THE BRAIN THAT WE CALL DEVELOPMENTAL NERAL PLASTICITY IS COMPLETED I MOST OF THE STUDIES TO DAY THAT I'LL TALK ABOUT INVOLVED SUBJECTS RANGING FROM TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE OUT TO ABOUT SEVENTY YEARS OF AGE BUT NO ONE YOUNGER SO AGAIN SCYLICIBON AND ITS USE IS CERTAINLY NOT FOR EVERYBODY ITS STILLY LEGAL ITS BEING USED IN THE CLINICAL SETTING AND RESEARCH SETTING THOUGH THESE POCKETS OF DECRIMINALIZED AREAS AND POTENTIALLY SOON LEGALIZATION OF SYLICIBON BUT AGAIN ONLY IN THE PROPER CLINICAL SETTING AGAIN I SAY THAT NOT JUST TO PROTECT MYSELF BUT I SAY THAT ALSO TO PROTECT ALL OF YOU SCYLICIBON IS A POWERFUL POWERFUL DRUG NOT JUST TO BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF ITS LONG STANDING CHANGES AFTER THE EFFECTS OF SCYLICIBON HAVE WORN OFF I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED A G ONE IS A VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AN TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE POD CAST THEREASON I STARTY TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS IN THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLTIC GRENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO BE THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GUT IS VERY IMPORTANT ITS POPULATED BY GUP MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE IMMUN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIOTIS AND ATHLETIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLETIC GREENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTIGENS VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL F Y FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTE RIGHT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ATH LETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD IN THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEAR'S SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TOO AGAIND THAT'S ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR'S SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THRE K TO STALK A LITOBIT ABOUT DOSING OF SCILISEIBEN AND ALSO ABOUT MICRODOSING OF SILISEIBEN AND THIS IS AN AREA THAT WHEN SAY IS CONTROVERSIAL BUT THAT THERE'S A HOWSH WE SAY THIS THERE'S A LOT OF A LOOSE THINKING AROUND THIS IN THE NON CLINICAL NON RESEARCH COMMUNITIES BUT WITHIN THE CLINICAL RESEARCH COMMUNITIES THERE'S A LOT OF DATA THAT'S COME OUT INDICATING WHAT EFFECTIVE AND SAFE DOSES PROVIDED ALL OTHER THINGS ARE CONSIDERED SAFE SAFE DOSES OF SILISEIBEN ACTUALLY ARE AND HERE WE REALLY CAN GO BACK TO OUR DISCUSSION OF SILISEIBEN AS QOTINC MAGIC MUSHROOMS OR MUSHROOMS AND IF ONE WERE TO TRANSLATE FROM THE MUSHROOM FORM OF SILISEIBEN TO THE SYLICIBON THAT'S ASHA USED IN VARIOUS STUDIES BECAUSE FRANKLY IN THESE STUDIES PEOPLE AREN'T EATING MUSHROOMS THEIR TYPICALLY TAKING SCYNTHETIC CYLICIBEN EITHER INTERVENEOUSLY INJECTED INTO A VAIN OR ORALY AND THAT'S HOW THE RESEARCHERS ARE ABLE TO TIGHTLY CONTROL THE AMOUNT OF SILISEIBEN AND THE TYPICAL DOSAGE THAT'S USED IN CLINICAL STUDIES RANGES FROM ONE MILIGRAM OFTEN GIVEN REPEATEDLY FROM DAY TO DAY OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME SO CALLED MICRODOSING AND REALLY THAT ONE MILIGRAM PER DAY OR EVEN UP TO THREE MILIGRAMS PERDAY REPEATEDLY OVER TIME IS WHAT PEOPLE GENERALLY THINK OF AS MICRODOSING AS COMPARED TO SAY EIGHT TEN MILIGRAM DOSE GIVEN ONCE MAYBE TWICE IN TWO SEPARATE SESSIONS OR A TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY MILIGRAM DOSAGE THE 'S GIVEN ONCE OR TWICE NOW THOSE AMOUNTS OF ONE TO THREE MILIGRAMS OR TEN MILIGRAMS OR TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY MILIGRAMS MIGHT NOT MEAN MUCH TO THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS IN THE RESEARCH TERMS PERHAPS YOU'VE HEARD OF MICRODOSING AND E'VE ALSO HEARD OF MACKRE OR CONICHEROIC DOSAN QE THAT SORT OF A COMMON ER I WSHOUL TAY POPULAR NOMIN CLATURE FOR SYCHODELICSAND I'LL CIRCLE BACK TO THAT IN A FEW MINUTES BUT I THINK ONE OF THE QUESHIONS THAT I HEAR A LOT IS HOW MUCH SCYLICIBON IS PRESENT IN A GIVEN AMOUNT OF MUSHROOMS AND SO THE WAY THI'S TYPICALLY WORKS IS THAT MUSHROOMS ARE OFTEN DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF GRAHMS OR OUNCES SO IN EIGHTH OF MUSHROOMS VERS TO AN EIHTH OF AN OUNCE OF MUSHROOMS OR EX NUMBER O GRAHMS OF MUSHROOMS THE BREAKDOWN IS ACTUALLY QUITE SIMPLE ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS EQUALS ONE GRAM AND THE CONCENTRATION OF SYLICIBEN IN MOST SO CALLED MAGIC MUSHROOMS IS ABOUT ONE PER CENT SO ONE GRAHM OF MUSHROOMS BEING ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS MEANS THAT IT CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY AGIT'S APPROXIMATELY TEN MILIGRAMS OF SYLICIVEN AND IN MOST OF THE CLINICAL STUDIES IT'S BEEN SHOWN THAT THE DOSAGE OF TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY MILIGRAMS GIVEN OR I SHOULD THEY TAKEN ONCE OR TWICE WILL TALK ABOUT THE SPACING OF SESSIONS LOEIT LATER TAKEN ONCE OR TWICE IS WHAT'S LEADING TO THE MOST PRONOUNCE THEIRAPEUTIC OUTCOMES BUT OF COURSE WITH IN HENCE THEI REPEUTIC OUTCOMES ONE ALSO OBSERVEENHANCED SIDEAFFECT PROFILES OR WHAT ARE CALLED ADVERSE EVENTS SO THERE'S AN IMPORTANT NUANT'S CONVERSATION THAT HAS TO TAKE PLACE BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CONVERSION OF GRAHMS OF MUSHROOMS TO SYLICIVE SO ONE GRAHM OF MUSHROOMS BEING ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS CONTAINING ONE PER CENT SYLIIBON MEANS THAT IT CONTAINS TEN MILIGRAMS OF SYLICIVEN NOW THE SO CALLED HEROIC DOSE IS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S DISCUSTED MORE WITH THE AND LET'S CALL THEM TRADITIONAL OR CLASSIC PSYCHONOTS THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT MAY HAVE AN ADVANCE DEGREE BUT TYPICALLY ARE NOT RUNNING LABORATORIES EXPLORING THE EFFECTS OF SYLICIBON AND CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO OM HAVE BEEN LONG TIME EXPLORERS AND OFTEN WRITERS AND ON PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SPOKES PEOPLE FOR SYLICIBON ANOTHER SYCHODELICS AND THEY WILL OFTEN REFER TO THE SO CALLED HEROIC DOSES SYLOBIT HARD TO TRANSLATE FROM THAT INFORMAL COMMUNITY TO THE SCIENTIFIC DATA BUT IN DISCUSSING THAT TOPIC WITH VARIOUS RESEARCHES WHO RUN LABORATORIES AT MAJOR UNIVERSITIES FOCUSED ON SYCHODELIC THERAPIES WHAT I WAS TOLD IS THAT THE QUOTINHEROIC DOSE THAT'S OFTEN DISCUSS REALLY REFERS TO A FIVE GRAM OR SO DOSE OF MUSHROOMS SO WAT THAT TRANSLATES TO IS FIFTY MILIGRAMS OF SCYLICIBEN SO WEN YOU HEAR SOME ONE TALK ABOUT A QUNIHEROIC DOSE THE PROBABLY REFERRING TO INGESTION OF FIFTY MILIGRAMS OR SO OF SYLICIBON BUT IN ITS MUSHROOM FORM SO ABOUT FIVE GRAMS OF MUSHROOMS AND AGAIN IT'S IMPORTANT POINT OUT THAT THE CONCENTRATION OF SYLICIBON IN DIFFERENT STRAINS OF MUSHROOMS AND IN DIFFERENT BATCHES AND DEPENDING ON THE AGE OF THOSE MUSHROOMS AND HOW THEY'VE BEEN STORED ET CETERA CAN VARY TREMENDOUSLY FROM BATCH DOBATCH IN FACT THEY'RE SOME LABORATORIES THAT HAVE EXPLORED THE RANGE OF SYLICIBON CONCENTRATION INDIFFERENT MUSHROOM STRAINS  DIFFERENC O CALLE MAGIC MUSHROOMS AND THAT RANGE IS PRETTY BROAD IT'S ANYWHERE FROM A HALF PER CENT ALL THE WAY UP TO TWO PER CENT WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT SOME ONE MIGHT GET A HOLD OF ONE GRAM OF MUSHROOMS THINKING THAT THEY'RE TAKING TEN MILIGRAMS OF SYLICIBON IN THOSE MUSHROOMS WHEN IN FACT THEIR ACTALY TAKING TWENTY OR SOMEBODY COULD TAKE THREE GRAMS OF MUSHROOMS THINKING THEY'RE TAKING THIRTYGRAMS OF SYLICIBON AND IN FACT THEY'RE ONLY TAKING TEN OR FIFTEEN MILIGRAMS OF SYLICBOEN SO THE SORCING IS REALLY KEY A OBVIOUSLY AS THINGS BECOME MORE LEGAL AND MORE REGULATED AND MORE USED IN THE THERAPEUTIC SETTING OR AND THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING MORE AND MORE OR AS PEOPLE START TO RELY ON SYNTHETICALLY MADE SILICIBEN AS OPPOSED TO USING MUSHROOMS TO INJEST SILICIBON THEN CERTAINLY THE DOSAGING IS GOING TO BE MORE CONSISTENT FROM BATCH TOBATCH BECAUSE WERE NOTSING ABOUT BATCHES MUSHROOMS WERE TALKING ABOUT BATCHES OF SILICIBON ITSELF SO NOW I LIKE TO TAKE A STEP BACK FROM ALL THIS CHEMISTRY AND SELBIOLOGY AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF A SILICIBON JOURNEY ITSELF AND RELATE THAT TO WHAT WE NOW KNOW ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE BRAIN JURING THI SILICIBON JOURNEY AND THEN A LOBIT LATER WE WILL RETURN TO THAT SERATONE AN TUA RECEPTOR WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE MORE LASTING CHANGES IN BRAIN CHEMISTRY AND BRAIN WIRING THAT OCCUR AFTER THE SILICIBON JOURNEY IS OVER LET'S TAKE A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND JUST DISCUSS THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF AN EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC SIYLICIBON JOURNEY AND HERE I'M NOT DETAILING A MENU OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD DO IN ORDER TO PRETEND THAT THEY ARE A SYLICIBEN ASSISTED THERAPE COACH OR A TO DO SELF ADMINISTERED SILICIBON THERABE THAT IS NOT WHAT I'M DOING WHAT I AM TRYING TO DO IS TO SHARE WITH YOU THE CONSISTENT COMPONENTS THAT ARE PRESENT IN THE CLINICAL TRIALS THAT IF DEMONSTRATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SILICIBON FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION AND FOR OTHER COMPULSIVE AND ADDICTIVE DISORDERS AND THOSE DATA MEANING THE SPECIFIC DATE OF RELATED TO THOSE TRIALS AND THE REFERENCES THEMSELVES WILL GET INTO ELOBIT LATER BUT WE CAN'T REALLY HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT SILISIBON AND WHAT IT DOES WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT THE SO CALLED SET AND SETTING AS IT'S OFTEN REFERRED TO THAT IS KNOWN TO AT LEAST BIAS THE PROBABILITY OF THE JOURNEY BEING BENEFICIAL AND NOT A SO CALLED BADB TRIP SO WHAT ARE THE VARIABLES THAT MAKE UP AN EFFECTIVE AND SAFE SILICIBON JOURNEY AND AGAIN WHEN WE SAY SAY FOR REFERRING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT PRONE TO SYCOTIC EPISODES DON'T EHAVE A FIRST RELATIVE THAT'S PRO N TO PSYCHOTIC EPISODES TI MOT PEOPLE THAT ARE TWENTY FIVE YEARS ARE OLDER RETING MY PEOPLE THAT FOR INSTANCE ARE NOT TAKING ANTIDEPRESSENCE THAT IMPACT THE CERATONEAN SYSTEM THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND I THING A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS BUT AS FAR AS I KNOW ALL OF THE STUDIES THAT HAVE EXPLORED SYLICIBON FOR ITS ABILITY TO POSITIVELY IMPACT BRAIN CHEMISTRY AND MOOD AND FUNCTION HAVE REQUIRED THAT PEOPLE EITHER NOT BEYOND OR ABSTAIN FROM ANTIDEPRESSENS IN THE WEEKS LEADING UP TO THE SYLICIBON JOURNEY NOW THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT IF YOU ARE OCCURRENTLY TAKING ESCESSORIZE OR SOMETHING SIMILAR THAT YOU SHOULD CEASE TAKING THEM INDO SCYLICIBE AND I AM ABSOLUTELY NOT SAYING THAT THAT COULD BE VERY VERY VERY DANGEROUS IF NOT CATESTROPHIC ANY TIME OUR GING TO TAKE ANYTHING OR STOP TAKING ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER YOU D YOU NEAN TO CONSULT WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN THES KETS A PSYCHIATRIST AS WELL SO LET'S TALK ABOUT SYLICIBON JOURNEYS FROM THE SUBJECTIVE SIDE AND FROM THE STRUCTURAL SIDE D WHEN I SAY THE STRUCTURAL SIDE WHAT I MEAN IS WHAT IS A PSYCHODELIC JOURNEY ACTUALLY INCLUDE AND HERE THE WORDS SET AND SETTING BECOME EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THAT SET AND SETTING ARE THE FOUNDATION OF A WELL DONE OR EVEN THERAPEUTICALLY BENEFICIAL PSYCHODELIC JOURNEY AND ALL OF THAT REALLY HINGES ON SAFETY AND OUTCOMES SO SET REFERS TO MIND SET THE MIND SET OF THE PERSON TAKING THE PSYCHODELIC AND SETTING REFERS TO AS THE NAMES JUST THE SETTING IN WHICH THEY'RE TAKING IT IN AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PRESENT THERE SO LET'S TALK ABOUT SETTING FIRST THE SETTING FOR A PSYCHODELIC JOURNEY NEEDS TO BE ONE IN WHICH THE PERSON UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE SCYLICIBE AND OR OTHER PSYCHODELIC IS SAFE THAT MEANS NO WINDOWS THEY CAN JUMP OUT OF THAT MEANS NO STREETS OF MOVING CARS THEY CAN RUN OUT INTO THAT MEANS NO OPPORTUNITY FOR GETTING LOST THAT MEANS NO OPPORTUNITY FOR GETTING INTO BODIES OF WATER IN OTHER WORDS IT REQUIRES THAT THERE BE AT LEAST ONE AND PERHAPS EVEN TWO OR MORE OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT ALSO TAKE ING PSYCHODELICS WHO ARE NOT ALSO TAGING PSYCHODELICS PRESENT IN THAT SETTING TO INSURE THAT THE PERSON TAKING THE SYLICIBON IS NOT GOING TO HARM THEMSELVES OR OTHERS I SAY THIS NOT TO SOUND LIKE A SCHOOL TEACHER EVEN THE TECHNICALLY ON HE SCHOOL TEACHER BUT BECAUSE OF COURSE I DON'T WANT ANY ONE TO GET HARMED AND I AM ALSO AWARE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF INTERESTS NOWADAYS IN PSYCHODELIC SUCH A SYLICIBEN BECOMING LEGAL OR DECRIMINALIZED FOR THEIR THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS AND IF WE LOOK BACK TO THE LATE NINETEEN SIXTIES IN EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHEN THE CONTROL SUBSTANCES ACT WAS INVOKED TO MAKE PSYCHODELIC S LIKE SYLICIBAN ILLEGAL ONE OF THE BASIES FOR THAT WAS NOT JUST THE GEO POLITICAL UNREST AT THE TIME AND THINGS LIKE THE V AT NON MORE BUT ALSO SOME HIGHLIGHTED INSTANCES IN WHICH PEOPLE DID NOT TAKE SETT IN SETTING INTO CONSIDERATION TOOK THINGS LIKE ELESTEVE STARED AT THE SUN WHEN BLIND OR TOOK SYLICIBEN WENT OUT AND HARMED SOMEBODY ELSE AGAIN THESE ARE VERY VERY ISOLATED INSTANCES BUT THESE ARE THE EXACT SORT OF INSTANCES THAT LEAD TO CRIMINALIZATION OR THE FACT THAT THINGS LIKE SYLICIBON AND ELIST AND M D M A FOR THAT MATTER ARE CONSIDERED ILLEGAL AGAIN I COMPLETELY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS MAKING THEM ILLEGAL WE COULD HVE A WHOLE DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT AM IU WE TIK ABOUT THE DRUG TRADE THE WAR ON DRUGS BUT RIGHT NOW IS SUCH A CRITICAL TIME IN THE HISTORY AND THE USE OF PSYCHODELICS FOR THERAPEUTIC AND OTHER REASONS AND GETTING SETTING CORRECT MEANING MAKING IT ABSOLUTELY AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE FOR THE PERSON TAKING THE PSYCHODELIC IS ABSOLUTELY KEY AND ONE OF THE BESTWAYS TO INSURE THAT IT'S SAFE IS TO HAVE RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT UNDER TE INFLUENCE OF PSYCHODELICS PRESENT IN THAT ENVIRONMENT SO THAT'S ONE COMPONENT OF SETTING THE OTHER COMPONET OF SETTING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE VERY IMPORTANT IS THE OPPORTUNITY AND PERHAPS EVEN THE BIAS TOWARD THE PERSON ON THE PSYCHODELIC BEING SEATED OR IDEALLY LYING DOWN AND BEING IN THE I MASK OR AT LEAST HAVING THEIR EYES COVERED SO THAT THEY CAN COMBINE ANY SPONTANEOUS VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS THAT OCCUR WITH THE VARIOUS THOUGHT PROCESSES THAT ARE OCCURRING WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF PSYCHODELICS THIS IS FAR AND AWAY DIFFERENT THEN QUOTENQUOTE TAKING MUSHROOMS IN GOING INTO THE WOODS OR TAKING MUSHROOMS IN GOING TO THE BEACH WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TO DAY IS THE USE OF PSYCHODELICS FOR PARTICULAR BRAINREWIRING OUTCOMES THAT YES CAN INVOLVE THINGS LIKE CHANGING ONE'S RELATIONSHIP TO NATURE OR CHANGING ONE'S RELATIONSHIP TO SOMEBODY ELSE BY INTERACTING WITH NATURE OR PSOMEBODY ELSE AND WHILE I'M NOT TRYING TO DIMINISH THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF THOSE SORTS OF PSYCHODELIC JOURNEYS IF WE LOOK AT THE SCIENTIFIC DATA THE VAST MAJORITY OF IT NOT JUST IN THE CLINICAL SETTING BUT IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY AND POSITIVE REWIRING OF BRAIN CIRCUITRY THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO FEEL BETTER TO UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES BETTER INTO INTERACT WITH LIFE IN MORE ADAPTIVE WAYS GOING FORWARD OUT OF THE PSYCHODELIC JOURNEY INVOLVE THESE VERY WHAT'S SAY UM YOU KNOW SUBDUED SETTINGS THAT A ARTYPICALLY IN ONE ROOM A CLOSED ENVIRONMENT WITH ONE OR TWO OTHER INDIVIDUALS ACTING AS SORT OF GUIDES OR AM HELPING THE INDIVIDUAL ON BY TALKING TO THEM FROM TIME TO TIME IF THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO SORT THROUGH A PARTICULAR ASPET OF THE PSYCHODELIC JOURNEY THAT'S CREATING ANXIETY WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE CONTOUR OF THE PSYCHODELIC JOURNEY THAT ALMOST EVERYONE WHO TAKES SYLICIBEN AT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY MELEGRAM DOSAGES OPTENDS TO EXPERIENCE BUT THE SETTING THAT I'M DESCRIBING IS NOT JUST A LIST OF THINGS TO YOU NON'T MAKE SURE YOUR SAFE BUT THEY'RE REALLY THE LIST OF THINGS THAT ALSO INSURE THAT ONE CAN GET THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT OUT OF THE SYLISIPAN JOURNEY NOW OTHER THINGS INCLUDED IN SETTING THAT ARE KNOWN CAN FROM SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE TO BE VERY INFLUENTIAL IN TERMS OF THE EXPERIENCE THAT ONE HAS AND TO BUIS THINGS TOWARDS A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE ARE GAIN SAFETY I MASK BUT ALSO THE PRESENCE OF MUSIC NOW WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THIS FROM ONE OF THE PREMERE RES EARCHERS ON SYLICIBON ANOTHER SYCHODELICS WHICH IS ROBIN CARDART HERESIES OF PROFESSOR AT UNIVERSY OVE CALIFORNIA  SAN FRANCISCO WHOSE ONE OF THE MAJOR PIONEERS ON THE STUDIES OF SYCHODELICS AND WHEN HE FIRST AR TELLING ABOUT THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT MUSIC PLAYS I THOUGHT OCATHEMIC SENSE YOU KNOW I MUSIC CAN IMPACT OUR MOTION IMPACT ON THE WAY THAT WE THINK ON AND COULD THEREFORE IMPACT OF WHAT ONE EXPERIENCES DURING THE SYCHODELIC JOURNEY BUT HE REALLY UNDERSCORED FOR ME THE EXTENT TO WHICH MUSIC IS NOT JUST A O SORT OF INCIDENTAL FEATURE OF THE SETTING IN PSYCHODELIC SET AND SETTING BUT THAT IT IS ONE OF BUT THAT IT IS ONE OF THE MAJOR DRIVERS OF THE ACTUAL COGNITIVE AND EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE THAT SOMEBODY HAS ON SOMETHING LIKE SYLICIBON THAT ALLOWS THE SYLICIBON JOURNEY TO BE LOOKED AT OR VIEWED NOT JUST AS BENEFICIAL BUT AND THIS IS QUOTED IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AS ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND AND IMPORTANT POSITIVE EXPERIENCES THAT ONE EVER EXPERIENCED IN THEIR LIFE SO LT'S TALK ABOUT THE SORTS OF MUSIC THAT HAVE BEEN MUSED IN THESE CLINICAL STUDIES FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW LONG THE SILISIBON JOURNEY ITSELF IS GOING TO BE AND THE TYPICAL DURATION OF THE SYLISIBON JOURNEY IS ANYWHERE FROM FOUR TO SIX HOURS IT'S GOING TO DEPEND SOMEWHAT ON DOSE IT'S GOING TO DEPEND SOMEWHAT ON VERIABILITY IN PEOPLES O LIVERMETABOLISM AND IT'S ALSO GOING TO DEPEND SOMEWHAT ON HOW MUCH FOOD PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR GUT IN ALL THE CLLINICAL STUDIES THAT I READ IT WAS ADVISED THAT PEOPLE NOT HAVE ANY FOOD IN THEIR GUT AT THE TIME WHICH THEY INJEST OR INJECTED WITH THE SYLICIBON THIT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE TAKING SYLIIBAN MUSHROOMS IN ORDER TO GET THEIR SYLICIBON AND THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN A FEW STUDIES A MOST STUDIES HOWEVER USE SYNTHETIC SYLISIEEN TAKEN ORERLY AGAIN THAT'S CONVERTED TO SILISON IN THE GUT BY THE ASIDITY OF THE GUT AND THE ASCIDY OF THE GUT IS GOING TO BE IMPACTED BY THE VARIOUS FOODS THAT PEOPLE EAT AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS WHY PEOPLE ARE ADVISED T ID NOT EAT FOR AT LEAST FOUR HOURS PRIOR TO THE SILISIVEN JOURANEY SO HERE WE'VE GOT THIS SIX HOUR WHAT WE'E CALLING JOURNEY CAUSE THAT'S WHATEVER ONE CALLS IT OR TRIP THAT PEOPLE START EXPERIENCING ABOUT THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE MINUTES AFTER INJESTING SILISIVEN OR TAKING SILIEIVEN THERE'S A PEAK COMPONENT IN WHICH THERE'S A MAXIMAL INTENSITY OF EMOTION AN OFTEN THAT'S ALSO ASSOCIATE WITH ANXIETY AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THE ANXIETY COMPONENT IS PART OF WHAT IN THAT THERAPUTIC SETTING THEY REFER TO AS EGO DISSOLUTION AND THAT ANXIETY AROUND THE PEAK ND I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD PROBABLY HEAR PEIQE EXPERIENCE AND THINK OH ERE TOING ABOUT A PEAK POSITIVE EXPERIENCE BUT NO WE ARE REFERRING TO A PEIK EXPERIENCE IN ANXIETY THAT PEOPLE STAY WITH AND THEN COME DOWN FROM GRADUALLY AS ONE GOES FROM THE SECOND OR THIRD HOUR AFTER TAKING SILISIVEN AND THAT TAPERS OFF SLOWLY TORED THE SIX HOUR MARK WHAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE REFER TO AS PARASHOOTING BACK IN OF COURSE A THEY'RE NOT HOPEFULLY I VERY MUCH HOPE PEOPLE AREN'T ACTUALLY PARASHOOTING BACK IN WHILE ON SILISIVEN BUT I THINK YOU GET THE IDEA THE MUSIC THAT'S TYPICALLY PLAYED IN THE CLINICAL STUDIES USING SILISIVEN FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION OR FOR COMPULSIVE DISORDERS OR ADDICTION TENDS TO HAVE A PARTICULAR CONTOUR THAT MATCHES WITH AND CAN ALSO DRIVE THAT CONTOUR OF THE SILICIVON JOURNEY THAT I JUST DESCRIBED AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WEARING AN EYEMASK WITH GUIDES PRESENT SO PEOPLEWHO ARE NOT TAKING SILISEIVEN THERE AS WELL TO INSURE THAT THE PERSON FEELS SUPPORTED AND IS SAFE THE PERSON IS TYPICALLY LYING DOWN SOMETIMES SITTING DOWN BUT MORE OFTEN NOT LYING DOWN WEARING AN EYEMASK AND THE MUSIC THAT'S PLAYED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SILISIVON SESSION TENDS TO BE MUSIC THAT DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF VOCALIZATIONS IT TENDS TO BE THINGS LIKE CLASSICAL MUSIC IT TENDS TO BE FAIRLY LOW VOLUME BUT THAT THEN TRANSITIONS INTO MUSIC THAT HAS A LOT OF PRECUSSION SO OFTEN DRUMS THAT TENDS TO BE HIGHER VOLUME THAT HAS A LOT OF INTENSITY AT ABOUT THE TIME THAT ONE WOULD BE EXPERIENCING THE PIKE IN EMOTION AND IN PERCEPTION THE SO CALLED PIQUE OF THE JOURNEY THAT INTENSE MUSIC TENDS TO BE PLAYED FOR ABOUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES TO NINETY MINUTES DEPENDING ON THE STUDY ONE LOOKS AT AND THEN TENSE TO TRANSITION INTO SOFTER MUSIC AGAIN SOMETIMES CORAL TYPE OR MORE MOLOTIC MUSIC OFTEN FEMALE VOICES AN PARTICULAR AND THEN TRANSITION INTO NATURE SOUNDS AND THINGS THE MORE LESS MIMIC THE OUTSIDE NATURAL WORLD AND LESS SO AM SYNTHETIC THINGS LIKE DRUMS OR INSTRUMENTS AND VOCALIZATIONS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT SO WHY WOULD IT BE SO IMPORTANT THAT MUSIC MATCH AND EVEN CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE THAT PEOPLE HAVE ON PSYCHODELICS AND HERE WE SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE A COUPLE OF MOMENTS IN JUST TALK ABOUT WHAT THOSE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCES ARE LIKE SO FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE IN DON SYLISIBON OR ANY PSYCHODELICS IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO DESCRIBE BUT ONE WAY TO DESCRIBE IT IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF SO CALLED PERCEPTIOAL BLENDING SO FOR INSTANCE OF PEOPLE IN THE EYE MASK WILL REPORT SEEINGS SOME GEOMETRIC SHAPES AND COLORS BUT PERHAPS THE MUSIC THEYARE LISTENING TO WILL THEN START TO CHANGE THE INTENSITY OR THE MOVEMENT OF WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEIR SEEING HALLUCINATING INSIDE OF THE EYE MASK IN WAYS THAT ARE LINKED THIS IS REFERRED TO ASINESTHESIA OR THE MERGING OF DIFFERENT SENSES THAT ARE NOT ORDINARILY MERGED IN ADDITION PEOPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SYLISIBON OR OTHER PSYCHODELICS FOR THAT MATTER OFTEN WILL REPORT THAT THEIR PATTERN OF BREATHING BECOMES LINKED TO THE PERCEPTIONS OF THINGS THAT THEY ARE HEARING OR SEEING OR FEELING SO FOR INSTANCE IF THEY TAKE A BIG DEEP BREATH IN AND THEN A LONG EXHEL OUT THEY MAY FI NG THAT DURING THE LONG EX HAIL OUT THAT THE NOTES OF MUSIC THAT THEIR HEARING IN THOSE MOMENTS ARE ALSO DRAWN OUT FOR THE DURATION OF THE BREATH AND THEY'LL INHAL AND THAT THEI'RE GETTING AT LEAST WHAT THEY PERCEIVE AS CONTROL OVER THE MUSIC WHICH OF COURSE THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY CONTROLLING BY USING THEIR BREATH AND THAT PERHAPS THEIR VISUAL PERCEPTIONS ARE ALSO BEING MERGED WITH THAT SO THOSE ARE JUST A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF HOW PERCEPTIOAL BLENDING A CA CYNECESIA CAN OCCUR WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CYLICIBEN AND THIS REALLY IS HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL FROM ONE PERSON TO THE NEXT SOME PEOPLE FOR INSTANCE WILL FIND THAT IF THEY TAKE THEIR FINGER TIPS AND RUB THEM ACROSS THE COUCH OR THE CHAIR THAT THEY HAPPEN TO BE LYING DOWN OR SITTING ON THAT THEY WILL EXPERIENCE A CHANGE IN THE MUSIC A MAYBEVEN IF THEY YOU KNOW THEY MOVE THEIR HAND UP THEY HEAR AN INCREASE IN FREQUENCY OF SOUND THY MOVE THEIR HAND DOWN THEY HEAR DECREASE IN FREQUENCY OF SOUND IND THAT ALL OF THI IS LINKED TO THEIR EMOTIONAL STATE AT THE SAME TIME AND VICE VERSA ASS WERE COING ABOUT A LOT OF PERCEPTIAL AND EMOTIONAL BLENDING END SOME SENSE OF CONTROL OVER ONE'S PERCEPTIONS AND EMOTIONS IN A WAY THAT'S VERY UNORDINARY EVEN EXTRAORDINARY WE CAN STEP BACK FROM ALL OF THIS A VERY SUBJECTIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE PSYCHODELIC JOURNEY AND ASK WHAT IS GOING ON THAT WOULD ALLOW THESE SORTS OF THINGS TO OCCUR AND THERE YOU ARE ALREADY EQUIPPED WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE SALBIOLOGY AND THE CHEMISTRY THAT MAKES ALL OF THIS POSSIBLE AND THAT IS THAT WHEN SYLISIVON IS INJESTED AND THEN CONVERTED TO SILASEN TIT'S THE SILASON THAT CROSSES THE BLOOD RAINBARRIER AND THEN EVEN THOUGH SILASON LOOKS A LOT LIKE SERATONAN SILASON HAS IS INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO PREDOMINANTLY ACTIVATE THE SARATONE INTO A RECEPTOR WELL WE CAN UNDERSTAND MUCH OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AT A SUBJECTIVE LEVEL DURING THE PSYCHODELIC JOURNEY EVEN WRITE DOWN TO THE SORTS OF EMOTIONS AND PERCEPTIOAL BLENDING THE CYNECESIA WE CAN UNDERSTAND A LOT OF THAT BY UNDERSTANDING WEAR THE SARATONE INTO A RECEPTORS ARE EXPRESSED ON NURONS AND WHAT THOSE PARTICULAR NURONS ARE DOING AND THE SIMPLEST WAY TO DESCRIBE THIS IS THAT THERE'S A CATEGORY OF NURONS THAT WE CALL PERAMINAL NURONS PERAMINAL NURONS ARE FOUND LOTS OF PLACES IN THE BRAIN BUT THERE CALLED PERAMNAL NURONSCAS ARE OR SHAPE LIKE A PYRAMID THEY HAVE A CELL BODY WHICH IS THE PART OF THE CELL THAT HAS THE DEANAINIT AND A LOT OF OTHER IMPORTANT THE THINGS LIKE THE ORGANELS MIGHT ACCONDRE ET CETERA AND THEN THEY ALSO HAVE WHATARE CALLED DENDRITES DENDRITES OF THE LITTLE BRANCHES OR PROCESSES THAT REACH OUT BOTH FROM THE BOTTOM OF THESE CELLS AND THEN THESE PERAMINAL CELLS ARE INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY ALSO GROW A BRANCH UP UP UP UP UP INTO LAYERS OF NURAL TISSUE ABOVE THEM AND THAT WHATS CALLED AN APICAL BRANCH THAT'S THE PART THAT GROWS UP AND THEN THEY FAN OUT AT THE TOP AND THAT FANNING OUT AT THE TOP ALOUS THEM TO COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER NURONS IN THEIR ENVIRONMENTS CASO IF YOU'RE NOT GETTING A GOOD PICTURE OF THIS IN YOUR MIND FOR MY DESCRIPTION I APOLOGIZE BUT SIMPLY THINK ABOUT PUTTING YOUR ARMS OUT TO THE SIDE AND BY DOING THAT YOUARE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH THINGS THAT ARE SOME DISTANCE FROM YOUR BODY OR OF AN OBVIOUS THING IN THAT CASE THESE CELLS ARE EFFECTIVELLY DOING THE SAME THING BY EXTENDING LITTLE PROCESSES OUT INTO LAYERS ABOVE THEM AND TO TE SIDES AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE MUCH OF THE SCERATONE INTO A RECEPTORS THAT ARE PRESENT ON NURONS IN THE BRAIN ARE PRESENT IN THOSE APICAL DENDRITES THOSE BRANCHES OF THESE PERAMINAL NURONS THAT ARE ABOVE AND THAT EXTEND OUT TO THE SIDE OF THOSE NURONS AND SO WHEN SOMEBODY IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SYLLISIBON THAT MEANS THAT SILASON HAS BOUND TO THE RECEPTORS ON THOSE APICAL DENDRITS AND IT'S INCREASING LATERAL COMMUNICATION ACROSS BRAIN AREAS IN FACT THIS IS PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST WELL DOCUMENTED EFFECTS OF SYLLISIBON AND OTHER PSYCHODELICS WHICH IS THAT THERE'S A SHIFT FROM THE BRAIN BEING MORE MODULARE MEANING MORE SEGMENTED LIKE AUDITORY NURONS ARE COMMUNICATING ELECTRICALLY AN CHEMICALLY LARGELY WITH OTHER AUDITORY NURONS OF COURE THEY'LL COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER TYPES OF NURONS TOO RIGHT WHEN I HEAR SOMETHING OFF TO MY R IGHT YUNIL A SNAP OF FINGERS OFFRIGHT I'LL TURN MY HEAD AND THE MY ABILITY TO DO THAT DEPENDS ON MY AUDITORY NURANS BEING LINKED UP WITH THINGS LIKE MY MOTOR SYSTEM IN MY VISUAL SYSTEM BUT THE KEYTHING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT WHEN THERE IS SYLICIB AN PRESENT IN ONE SYSTEM THAT THE COMMUNICATION OF ANY OF THESE PERAMETAL NURANS THE ONES INVOLVED IN HEARING THE ONES INVOLVED IN THINKING THE ONES INVOLVED IN MEMORY THE ONES INVOLVED IN VISUAL PERCEPTION OR IN THE GENERATION OF VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS WITH EYES CLOSED THOSE ARE ALL TALKING TO MANY MANY MORE OTHER NURONS MORE EXTENSIVELY SO WHAT HAPPENS EFFECTIVELY IS THAT THERE'S A REDUCTION IN THE MODULARITY THE SEPARATENESS OF FUNCTION IN THE BRAIN AND IN INCREASE IN WHAT'S CALLED INTEGRATION OF COMMUNICATION ACROSS WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE DISPERATE BRAIN REGIONS WE CAN SAY THAT REALLY SIMPLY BY SAYING SYLICIBON INCREASES COMMUNICATION ACROSS THE BRAIN NOW IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE'S A REDUCTION IN WHAT'S CALLED THE HIERARCHICAL ORGANIZATION OF TH BRAIN TYPICALLY CENSORY INFORMATION COMES IN FROM THE OUTSIDE ENVIRONMENTS SO WE HEAR SOMETHING WE SEE SOMETHING WE TASTE SOMETHING WE SMELL SOMETHING AND IN WHAT'S CALLED BOTTOM UP FASHION MEANING BOTTOM FROM THE PERIPHERY UP MEANING IT PROPAGATES UP THROUGH THE EYES THROUGH THE NOSE THROUGH THE EARS THROUGH THE SKIN WERE THE SENSES IN THOSE REGIONS I SHOULD SAY UP INTO AIRAS OF THE BRAIN THAT SIT DEEP TO THE QUARTTEX LIKE THE PHALYMUS AND THEN THE PHALYMUS IS SORT OF A WAY STATION S LIKE A SWITCHBOARD THAT SENDS VISUAL STUFF TO THE VISUAL CENTERS AND AUDITORY STUFF TO THE AUDITORY CENTERS AND TOUCH STUFF TO THE TOUCH CENTERS AND THINGS THAT A MAYBE TRIGGER A MEMORYED OFF TO THE MEMORY CENTERS OF THE BRAIN ET CETERA THAT'S THE TYPICAL ORGANIZATION IT'S HIARCHICAL BECAUSE IT GOES FROM THE PERIPHERY UP TO THE MORE COMPLEX PROCESSING REGIONS OF THE BRAIN THAT MAKE DECISIONS THAT A LINK ALL OF THAT STUFF TO PRIOR EXPERI ANCE MAY BE PLANS ABOUT THE FUTURE WHEN SYLICIBON IS PRESENT IN THE SYSTEM THERE IS A BROADENING OF THE FLOW OF THAT INFORMATION FROM THE BOTTOM UP AS WELL AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH WHAT'S CALLED THELAMIC GATING THE THALYMUS IS A VERY INTERESTING STRUCTURE WE PRBABLY DON'T WANT TO GO INTO IT IN TOO MUCH DETAIL RIGHT NOW BUT IT REALLY IS LIKE A SWITCH BOARD IN A WAY STATION SAYING PAY PAY ATTENTION TO THE VISUAL STUFF ON PAY ATTENTION TO THE AUDITORY STUFF OR JUST TO THE VISUAL AND AUDITORY STUFF AND IGNORE ON OU NO TOUCH SENSATION FOR THE TIME BEING ORE VICE VERSA WHEN SYLISIBON IS PRESENT IN THE SYSTEM AND WHEN CERETONE INTO A RECEPTORS ARE ACTIVATED VERY STRONGLY THERE IS A TREMENDOUS BROADENING OF THE FLOW OF INFORMATION UP AND THROUGH THE THALMUS SO NOT ONLY IS THERE MORE COMMUNICATION OF SO CALL HIGHER ORDER BRAIN CENTERS WE REFER TO THEM AS HIGHER ORDER BECAUSE THERE INVOLVED IN THINKING IN DECISION MAKING AN EMOTION ET CETERA BUT THEREIS ALSO A SHIFT IN THE FLOW OF CENSORY INFORMATION INTO THE BRAIN THAT CAN GENERALLY BE DESCRIBED AS BROADER AND INCLUDING MORE BLENDING OF THE DIFFERENT SENSES AND WHEN I SAY BLENDING OF THE SENSES I'M ALSO REFERRING TO BLENDING OF THE SENSE OF INTERROCEPTION OF OUR SENSE OF OUR BODY AND WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE OF OUR BODY AND THIS WITHOUT QUESTION AT LEAST PARTIALLY EXPLAINS WHY WHEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SYLISIBON ONE'S BREATHING CAN BE LINKED TO A SOUND AND THEN SUDDENLY THE SOUND ONE THINKS IS BEEN CONTROLLED BY ONE'S BREATHING OR THAT THE SOUND ITSELF CAN BE LINKED TO SOMETHING THAT WE SEE IN OUR MIND'S EYE WHILE IN THE EYEMASK ESSENTIALLY WHAT I'M DESCRIBING HERE IS THAT SERATONE INTO A RECEPTOR ACTIVATION ALLOWS FOR MORE BROAD LESS PRECISE AND LESS HYORCHICAL ACTIVATION OF BRAIN CIRCUITRY AND WHEN I SAY HYARCHICAL WHAT I MEAN IS THAT NORMALLY THINGS GO FROM PERIPHERY FROM EYES TO THALYMUS TO VISUAL QUARTECS HOWEVER WHEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SYLISIBON SI MENTION BEFORE EVEN IN THE EYEMASK THE VISUAL QUARTEC S GOING TO BE VERY ACTIVATED EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY VISUAL IMPUT SO THEN IF ONE HEARS A SOUND PERHAPS FROM MUSIC A PARTICULAR MOTI FOR VOICE AND THAT'S LINK TO A PARTICULAR MOTIONAL STATE THAT IS NOW BEING BLENDED WITH VISUAL PHENOMENON OCCURRING WITHIN THE BRAIN THAT HAVE NO EXTERNAL STIMULUS AND SO WHILE THE PATTERNS OF ACTIVATION IN THE BRAIN WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SYLICIBON AREN'T RANDOM THEY ARE FAR LESS CHANNELLED FAR LESS MODULAR AND FAR LESS HIERARCHICAL THAN WOULD EVER BE THE CASE WHEN NOT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SYLICIBOEN NOW IN ALL FAIRNESS TO THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE THEY ARE NOT ONE NOT TO NOT THREE BUT FOUR PROMINENT THEORIES OF WHICH BRAIN NETWORKS ARE MOST ACTAVATED DURING A SYLICIBON OR OTHER PSYCHODELIC JOURNEY AND SO FOR THOSE WHOF YOU THER ARE INTERESTED IN THOSE DIFFERENT MODELS FIRST OF ALL PLEASE KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT COMPETING MODELS WHILE SOME OF THEM DISAGREE ABOUT SOME OF THE DETAILS IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT ALL OF THESE MODELS ARE TRUE THEY INCLUDE THINGS LIKE CHANGES IN THE SO CALLED DEFAULT MODE NETWORK THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN THIS I'VE TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK AS THE NETWORK IN THE BRAIN THATS THOUGHT TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SPONTANEOUS IMAGINATION FOR DAY DREAMING AND THAT REFLECTS SORT OF THE BASE ACTIVATION STATE OF THE BRAIN WHEN THERE'S NO DRUGS IN OUR SYSTEM AND THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK IS ONE OF THE SYSTEMS OR NETWORKS RATHER THAT IS THOUGHT TO BE REWIRED UNDER CONDITIONS OF SYLICIBON OR OTHER PSYCHODELICS AGAIN IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THESE MODELS IN COMPARING AND CONTRASTING THEM THERE'S A VERY NICE REVIEW FROM BRIAN ROFGH SLAB AT DUKE ON ENTITLED THE NORL BASIS OF PSYCHADELIC ACTION WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THIS IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS AND AGAIN I JUST WANT EMPHASIZE THAT ALL OF THESE MODELS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE TRUE INDIFFERENT STUDIES AND WHAT THEY ALL POINT TO IS IT MORE EXTENSIVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT NORMALLY ARE NOT AS ACTIVE AT THE SAME TIME WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF PSYCHODELICS SUCH A SYLICIBON THE CONTROVERSYING THE FIELD RELATES TO WHICH OF THESE NETWORKS IS THE ONE THAT CHANGES THE MOST TO EXPLAIN THE THERAPEUTIC OUTCOMES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN RECENT YEARS SO AGAIN CHOCK OUT THEIR REVIEW IF YOU'R INTERESTED IN THAT SORT OF THING IN THE MEANTIME WE CAN CUT A BROAD SWA THROUGH ALL OF THOSE MODELS JUST SAY THAT SYLICIBON EXPANDS THE FUNCTIONAL CONUCTIVITY OF THE BRAIN WHILE ONE IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SYLISIBON AND IT DOES SEEM THAT SOME OF THAT ECXPANDED FUNCTIONAL CONUCTIVITY PERSISTS AFTER THE EFFECTS OF SYLISIBON HAVE WORN OFF AND THAT STATEMENT ABOUT THE FUNCTIONAL CONTIVITY OF THE BRAIN BEING MORE EXPANDED NOT JUST JURING THE SYLISIBONSESSION BUT AFTER AS WELL HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIATED A NUMBER OF PAPERS BUT ONE OF THE KEY PAPERS IN THIS AREAS ONE THAT I RECOMMEND PEOPLE CHECK OUT IF THEYARE INTERESTED IN THIS SORT OF THING IS ENTITLED THE EFFECTS OF SYLICIBON AND M DMA ON BETWEEN NETWORK RESTING STATE FUNCTIONAL CONUCTIVITY IN HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS AND I LIKE THIS PAPER FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS FIRST OF ALL THE VERY HIGH QUALITY PAPER CARRIED OUT IN THE LABORATORY OF ROBIN CART ART HERRIS AT OU SEASEF AGAIN ONE OF THE PREMERE RESEARCHERS IN THIS AREA OF SYCHODELICS AND THEIR FUNCTION WHAT THEY DO IN THE BRAIN AND ALSO THEIR THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT FOCUS ON HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS THEY EXPLORED USING BRAIN IMAGING WHAT BRAIN AREAS ARE ACTIVE IN ARRESTING STATE SO THINGS LIKE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK THEN THEY HAD PEOPLE TAKE SYLICIBON OR M D MA AND THEN THEY LOOKED AT THE CONUCTIVITY BETWEEN THOSE BRAIN AREAS IN THOSE SAME INDIVIDUALS WHEN THEY WERE NOT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THESE STRUGS AND FOUND MORE EXTENSIVE CONICTIVITY ALL OF WHICH POINTED TO AN ENHANCED LATERAL CONICTIVITY LESS HIEARCHICAL ORGANIZATION EFFECTIVELY MORE INTERCONNECTION AND COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT BRAIN AREAS I THINK NOT ONLY IS THE FACT THAT THEY LOOKED AT HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS VERY INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT BUT ALSO THAT THEY LOOKED AT THIS RESTING STATE OF THE BRAIN THEY WEREN'T PROVIDING A PARTICULAR AUDITORY OR VISUAL STIMULUS FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR OR LOOK AT WHILE THEY WERE IN THE BRAIN IMAGING SCANNER AS IT'S CALLED RATHER THERE WERE SIMPLY LOOKING AT HOW THE BRAIN WAS BEHAVING AT REST AND SO IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT FOR PEOPLE THAT DO TWO OR EVEN JUST ONE OF THESE SYLIIBAN JERN IEGS AND PARTICULAR DOSE THAT THE BRAIN IS ACTUALLY GETTING REWIRED AND WE HEAR THIS ALOT SYLICIBAN OR OTHER PSYCHODELICS LEAD TO PLASTICITY THEY REWIRE YOUR BRAIN WELL IT'S GO BACK TO WHAT WE SAID THE BEGINNING REWIRING OF THE BRAIN IS NOT THE GOAL ADAPTIVE REWIRING OF THE BRAIN IS THE GOAL I REWIRING THAT LEADS TO NEW IDEAS THAT ARE INTERESTING THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE AFTER THE PSYCHODELIC JOURNEY NEW IDEAS AND NEW WAYS OF THINKING OR FEELING THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO FUNCTION BETTER IN THEIR LIVES THAT'S THE GOAL OF EFFECTIVE PSYCHODELIC THERAPIES NOT SIMPLY REWIRING OF THE BRAIN YOU KNOW A BRAIN INJURY FOR THAT MATTER WILL LEAD TO REWIRINGER THE BRAIN BUT THAT'S MALADAPTIVE REWIRING THE USE OF THINGS LIKE AMPHETAMENES ARE MET THEM PHETAMEANES OF PARTICULAR WILL LEAD TO REWIRING OF THE BRAIN BUT THAT IS STRONGLY MALADAPT OF REWIRING SO NOW THER ARE REALLY DOZENS OF STUDIES CONDUCTED INHUMANS USING BRAIN IMAGING AN OTHER TECHNIQUES HAVE AVALUATED HOW THINGS LIKE SYLIIBON CHANGE CONUCTIVITY IN THE BRAIN AND I THINK THE TACO MESSAGE IS IT EXPANDS THAT CONICTIVITY HOWEVER IT SEEMS TO DO SO IN WAYS THAT STILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO FUNCTION IN THEIR DAILY LIVES  ONE OF THE KEE THINGS THAT I GLEANED FROM THE LITERATURE ON THAT THERAPEUTIC USE OF SYLICIBEN FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION IS THAT VERY SELDOM DO PEOPLE WHO TAKE SYLICIBE AN EXPERIENCE LONG TERM ISSUES WITH MEMORY WHY IS THAT SO CRITICAL WELL YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT INCREASING CONUCTIVITY IN THE BRAIN REDUCING MODULARITY REDUCING HIERARCHICAL ORGANIZATION F THE BRAIN WOULD LEAD TO DESRUPTIONS IN MEMORY WRIT ITS AS IF YOU ARE SHUFFLING BOOKS ON THE BOOKSHELF SO TO SPEAK BUT THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE CASE RATHER IT SEEMS THAT THE INCREASE IN CONUCTIVITY IS LEADING PROVIDED SET IN SETTING ARE CORRECT PROVIDED SAFETY PROTOCALS ARE FOLLOWED TO POSITIVE REWIRING OR ADAPTIVE REWIRING OF NERAL TISSUES SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES PSYCHODELICS AND SYLICIBON IN PARTICULAR VERY EXCITING FROM THE THERAPEUTIC STANDPOINT AN F COURSE WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE ITS ALSO WHAT HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE EXCITED ABOUT PSYCHODELICS NOT JUST FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION BUT FOR EXPANDING THE BRAINS CAPABILITIES MORE GENERALLY SO LONG THOSE LINES I WANT TO TOUCH ON THE ISSUES OF CREATIVITY AND THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE OUTSIDE OF PSYCHODELIC JOURNEYS IS IMPACTED BY PSYCHODELIC JOURNEYS AND HERE THIS RELATES TO A QUESTION THAT I HEARD A LOT WHEN I PUT THE CALL OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT I WAS GOING TO DO THIS EPISODE AND I ASKED PEOPLE WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT SYLICIVE A N ONE OF THE MORE COMMON QUESTIONS THAT I GOT WAS DOES IT INCREASE CREATIVITY DOES IT INCREASE OUR EXPERIENCE OF LIFE IN WAYS THAT ARE BENEFICIAL ASIDE FROM IT'S NOW DOCUMENTED POSITIVE EFFECTS IN TREATING DEPRESSION AND COMPULSIVE DISORDERS AND ADDICTION AND THE SHORT ANSWER TO THIS IS YES BUT THAT THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF PSYCHODELICS SYLICIVE BEN IN PARTICULAR ON CREATIVITY IN OUR EXPERIENCE OF LIFE HAVE ONLY BEEN EXPLORED IN A FAIRLY NARROW SET OF DIMENSIONS HOWEVER WHERE IT'S BEEN EXPLORED THERE SOME REALLY INTERESTING FINDING SO ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING FINDINGS I THINK IS A PAPER ENTITLED INCREASE LOW FREQUENTY BRAIN RESPONSES TO MUSIC AFTER SYLICIPENTHERAPY FOR DEPRESSION I THINK THIS IS A REALLY INTERESTING PAPER BECAUSE WHAT THE AUTHORS DID IS THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT IN THESE THEREPUTIC SYLICIBON SESSIONS THERE CARRIED OUT FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION MUSIC IS BEING PLAYED AND THERE ARE PRIOR STUDIES SHOWING THAT WHEN MUSIC IS PLAYED YOU ACTIVATE DIFFERENT BRAIN AREAS DEPENDING ON WHAT SORT OF MUSIC IS BEING PLAYED IT'S SOMEWHAT OBVIOUS PERHAPS YONA SAD MUSIC VERSES YO INTENSE ON HOU WOULD CUN THINK ABUT HEAVY METAL VERSES A CHOIRE MUSIC VERSES GRIGORIAN CHANCE VERSES A PUNCROC MUSIC AND ON AND ON IT MAKE SENSE THE DFFERENT BRAIN AREAS WOULD BE ACTAVATED WHEN DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF MUSIC ARE PLAYED HOWEVER THE DE SEEMS TO BE SOME UNIVERSAL FEATURES OF BRAIN ACTIVATION IN RESPONSE TO MUSIC THE SCHIPRABLY BE THE TOPIC OF AN ENTIRE EPISODE OF THE HURERMAN LABPODCASS AND INDEED IT WILL BE FOR INSTANCE THERE ARE AREAS OF THE AUDITOR ED CORTECS THAT ARE ACTIVATED NO SURPRISE THERE AND AREAS OF THE BRAINS REWARD CIRCUITRY THE SO CALLED VENTUAL STRIATUM AND THE SO CALLED MUSOLIMBIC REWARD PATHWAY TALKED A LOT ABOUT THESE IN THE EPISODES ABOUT DOPOMINE THAT I'VE DONE PREVIOUSLY THESE ARE BRAIN AREAS THAT LEAD TO THE RELEASE OF DOPOMINE IN OTHER BRAIN AREAS AND THAT REENFORCE CERTAIN EXPERIENCES AND THAT TEND TO GIVE US THE SUBJECTIVE FEELING OF YES I LIKE THIS I WANT MORE SO IN THIS PARTICULAR PAPER WHAT THE AUTHORS IS THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE IN THE CLENIC THEY'RE ON SYLISIBON THEY'RE LISTENING TO MUSIC AND AS YOU RECALL THE MUSIC PLAYED AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE SYLISIVON JOURNEY ARE DIFFERENT THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT EMOTIONAL COMPONENT AND MUSIC AS A REALLY NICE STIMULUS IN THE LABORATORIES WE SAY BECAUSE LIKE WITH VISUAL STIMULE YOU CAN BREAK IT DOWN INTO HIGH FREQUENCY LOW FREQUENCY RIGHT SOUNDS LIKE DUNDUN OR THESE KINDS OFTHINGS IWAS MY ATTEMPT AT LOW FREQUENCY VERSES HIGH FREQUENCY ON AUDITORY STIMULE OR AT THE SPACIAL FREQUENCY OR WHAT IN THE AUDITORY DOMAIN WOULD BE CALLED THE TEMPORAL FREQUENCY IS IT UM UM U OR IS IT UMU M ALL WE'VE CHANGED THERE IS THE TEMPORAL FREQUENCY THE SOUND WAS SOMEWHAT THE SAME BUT THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THOSE SOUNDS WAS DIFFERENT YOU GET THE IDEA SO THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THESE PEOPLE AND THESE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS AND THEY CAN PUT THEM IN THE BRAIN SCANNER AND THEY CAN DO THAT BEFORE AND AFTER HAVING TAKEN SYLIIBEN AND THE LONG  SHORT OF THIS STUDY IS THAT SYLICIBEN CHANGES ONE'S EXPERIENCE OF MUSIC NOT JUST JURING THE SILISIBEN JOURNEY ITSELF BUT THEREAFTER AND IN FACT IT CHANGES ONES EMOTIONAL RESPONSE TO MUSIC IN VERY INTERESTING WAYS FOR INSTANCE ONE OF THE MORE COMMON FEATURES OF MAJOR DEPRESSION IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T DERIVE AS MUCH PLEASURE FROM DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXPERIENCES WHETHER NOT ITS FOOD OR SEX OR SOCIAL EXPERIENCES TO THE POINT WHERE SOMETIMES THEY JUST STOP TRYING TO SEEK OUT THOSE EXPERIENCES PEOPLE WOITH DEPRESSION OFTEN FEELS IF MUSIC NO LONGER HAS THE SAME IMPACT IT JUST DOESN'T MEAELY LIFT THEM UP VERY MUCH THIS STUDY FOUND THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAKEN SYLISIVON CCORDING TO THE PERAMERS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER CAN GET A RETURN OF THE ELEVATED EMOTIONALITY THE POSITIVE EMOTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH MUSIC THAT FORMERLY MADE THEM FEEL GOOD IN OTHER WORDS THEY CAN FEEL MUSIC AGAIN THEY CAN FEEL GOOD IN RESPONSE TO MUSIC AGAIN NOW THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IN THEORY IT COULD BE THAT SYLISIVON SIMPLY ALLOWED THEM TO ACS ESS THE EMOTIONS AROUND MUSIC AGAIN MORE GENERALLY BUT THAT IC THUN NOT WHAT THIS PAPER AND SOME OTHER PAPERS THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED REPORT RATHER IT SEEMS THAT TAKING SYLISIVON CAN INCREASE ONE'S POSITIVE PERCEPTION OF MUSIC THAT ONE LIKES AND CAN TONE DOWN OR REDUCE THE DEPRESSIVENESS OR THE SADNESS OF MUSIC THAT TENDS TO MAKE ONE SAD EVEN AFTER THE SYLISIVON HAS WORN OFF AND FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AFTERWARDS MAYBE EVEN FOREVER ALTHOUGH NO STUDY OF COURSE CAN BE CARIED OUT FOREVER BECAUSE FOREVERS FOREVER WUT WE DO KNOW HOWEVER IS THAT SYLISIVON CAN REWIRE THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE EMOTION CENTERS IN THE BRAIN AND THE NETWORKS THAT CONTROL AUDITORY PERCEPTION OF MUSIC AND LEADS TO THIS CONDITION IN WHICH PEOPLE WHO FELT LIKE I WAS DEPRESSED OR I COULDN'T FEEL THE MUSIC I JUST WASN'T GAIN THE SAME LIFT AND JOY FROM AN AGAIN THEY CAN START TO EXPERIENCE MORE JOY FROM THAT MUSIC AGAIN AND THAT MUSIC THAT MADE THEM FEEL SAD AND DEPRESSED HAS A DIMINISHD CAPACITY TO MAKE THEM FEEL SAD AND DEPRESSED AND THERE'S A LOT OF NARROW IMAGING DATA AN THIS PAPER THAT POINT TO THE SPECIFIC BRAIN AREAS THAT INCLUDE AREAS LIKE THE VENTURAL TIGMENTALAREA THAT CAN EXPLAIN WHY THESE SORTS OF EFFECTS WERE THEC CUR SO THIS ISN'T JUST SUBJECTIVE REPORTS OF PEOPLE SAYING OYAN I WAS DEPRESSED AND MUSIC DIDN FEEL REALLY GOOD ANOUNT FEELS GREAT OR THAT USED TO MAKE ME FEEL SO SAD AND NOW I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A CAPACITY TO LISTEN TO THAT WITHOUT BEING YOU KNOW CRUSHED BY A FEELINGS OF SADNESS THE PAPER INCLUDED SOME SUBJECTIVE REPORTS OF THAT SORT BUT THEN WAS ABLE TO LINK THOSE TO CHANGES IN BRAIN CIRCUITRY IN BRAIN ACTIVATION IN RESPONSE TO MUSIC USING NOR IMAGING SO IN THAT WAY REALLY POINTS TO BOTH THE SUBJECTIVE AND STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL CHANGES THAT SILISIVIN CAN BRING ABOUT THROUGH THAT EXPANDED CONICTIVITY BETWEEN BRAINAIRS BECAUSE REMER DURING THE SIYLICIBON SESSION IT'S NOT AS IF MUSIC OR THE PERCEPTION OF MUSIC IS SPECIFICALLY BEING LOOKED AT OR FOCUSED ON AN THES STUDIES RATHER MUSIC IS PLAYING PEOPLE ARE IN THE EYE MASS OR FEELING ALL SORTS OF THINGS THEIR BREATHING THEIR HEARING THEIR TOUCH ITS ALL HAPPENING ALL AT ONCE THERE'S A PEAKE IT'S LONG THERE'S A LONG TAPER THE MUSICS CHANGING ALL OF THAT TOOK PLACE IN THIS STUDY AS WELL BUT IT IS AFTER THE SESSION WHEN COMPARING BRAIN ACTIVATION STATES TO MUSIC OF OUR PARTICULAR TYPE SAD OR HAPPY AND COMPARING THAT TO THE PATTERNS OF BRAIN ACTIVATION THAT OCCRRED BEFORE THE SILISIVAN JOURNEY THAT THEY DISCOVER THAT PEOPLE'S BRAINS HAVE REWIRE DURING THE SILICIV AN SESSION IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS THEM TO EXPERIENCE JOY IN RESPONSE TO MUSIC AGAIN SO THAT'S ONE OF THE MORE RIGOROUS STUDIES I WAS ABLE TO FIND THAT ADDRESSES THIS QUESTION OF WEATHER OR NOT SYLICIBON REALLY DOES REWIRE THE BRAIN IN WAYS THAT ALLOWS US TO BE MORE CREATIVE AN EXPERIENCE LIFE DIFFERENTLY AFTER THE SILISIVAN SESSION NOW THAT PAPER DIDN'T FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON CREATIVITY I DIDN'T ENTIRE EPISODE ON CREATIVITY THAT TALKED ABOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEDITATION LIKE OPEN MONITERING MEDITATION IT TALKED ABOUT A DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF THINKING THAT ONE CAN ACTUALLY PRACTICE TO INCREASE CREATIVITY WE HAD ARGUABLY ONE OF TH MOST CREATIVE PEOPLE ON THE PLANET RICK REUBEN CAME ON THIS PODCAST TALKED ABOUT THE CREATIVE PROCESS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF MUSIC AND HIS ROLLAN PRODUCING MUSIC TO CAN CHECK OUT THOSE EPISODES IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THE NURL CIRCUITORY RELATE TO CREATIVITY AT LEAST AT THE TIME OF RECORDING THIS EPISODE THERE HAVEN'T BEEN A LOT OF STUDIES LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT THE BRAIN NETWORKS THAT WE THINK ARE INVOLVED IN CREATIVITY AND HOW THOSE CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO SYLICIVEN AND OTHER PSYCHODELICS I IMAGINE THOSE STUDIES ARE EITHER HAPPENING NOW OR WI'LL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE BUT THE STUDIES I JUST DESCRIBED REFERRING TO THE CHANGES IN EMOTIONALITY AND RESPONSES TO MUSIC I THINK PROVIDE A NICE TEMPLET FOR WHAT'S LIKELY HAPPENING BOTH DURING SCYLICIBAN JOURNEYS AND AFTER THOSE SYLICIVAN JOURNEYS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LESS HIERARCHICAL ORGANIZATION MORE CONNUCTIVITY BETWEEN BRAIN AREAS WHAT IT'S POINTING TO IS THE FACT THAT DURING THE SYLICIVAN JOURNEY PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN NEW RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DIFFERENT CENSURY AND EMOTIONAL STATES AND THOSE NEW RELATIONSHIPS SEEM TO PERSIST LONG AFTER THE SYCHODELIC JOURNEY HAS BEEN FINISHED AND A LOT OF PEOPLE RESEARCHING SYLICIVAN IN THE CLINICAL SETTING THINK THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS WHY SYLICIVAN ANOTHER SYCHODELICS CAN REWIRE OUR RELATIONSHIP TO THINGS MORE BROADLY IT ALLOWS FOR NEW LEARNING NEW CONTINGENCIES AND WHEN WE LOOK AT DEPRESSION WE OFTEN THINK YOU KNOW DIMINISH MOOD PEOPLE NOWAVE AN APPETITE THAN AR INTERESTED AND SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS OR ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS THE REALLY STRUGGLING AND ALL OF THAT OF COURSE IS TRUE BUT ANOTHER LENDS TO LOOK AT DEPRESSION THROUGH IS THAT A LOT OF THAT THINKING AND A LOT OF THOSE EMOTIONAL STATES THAT ARE NEGATIVE ARE SOMEWHAT HABITUAL THEY RELATE TO A SORT OF IMPLICIT UNDERSTANDING AND LIVING OUT OF THE IDEA THAT A LEADS TO BE LEADS TO SEE E YOU SEEK OUT A RELATIONSHIP IT DOESN'T WORK OUT TRY NEW JOB YOU DON'T GET THE JOB U GET THE JOB IT'S NO GOOD ALL THESE NEGATIVE OUTCOMES IF IF A THEN BE THEN SE AND IT DOES SEEM THAT SYLICIBEN CAN HAVE THIS EFFECT OF INVOKING NEW PATTERNS OF LEARNING NEW CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE AND INDEED MAVEN LEAD TO ACTUAL REWIRING OF THE EMOTION CENTERS IN THE BRAIN WITH THESE OTHER BRAIN AREAS AND VICE VERSA IN WAYS THAT EJECT PEOPLE FROM THE SYLICIVANSESSION THINKING OH YOU KNOW I USED TO FEEL THIS WAY ABOUT SOMETHING WORK RELATIONSHIPS MYSELF ET CETERA BUT I'M WILLING TO CONSIDER THI OTHER POSSIBILITY OR THIS OTHER POSSIBILITY SEEMS AT LEAST PARTIALLY TRUE TO THE EXTENT THAT I'M WILLING TO GO OUT AND EVALUATE THAT NOW HERE I AM SPEAKING VERY SUBJECTIVELY BUT REMEMBER WE HAVE TO TIE BACK THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCES AND CHANGES OF THINGS LIKE MUSIC AND E MOTION AND OUR RELATIONSHIP TO LIFE AND JOBS AND RELATIONSHIPS BACK TO THE CELBIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY OF SYLICIVAN BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IT REALLY IS JUST A CHEMICAL ACTIVATING RECEPTORS THOSE RECEPTERS CHANGING NETWORKS IN THE BRAIN AND THE JOURNEY ITSELF SEEMS TO BE THE TIME WHEN ALL OF THOSE CHANGES ARE PUT IN MOTION IT'S LIKE A BOULDER THAT GETS ROLLING IN FACT I THNK THE BEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT SYLICIVON AND OTHER PSYCHODELICS IS THAT THEY INITIATE THE NEURL PLASTICITY PROCESS BUT THEY ARE NOT THE NEURAL PLASTICITY PROCESS ITSELF AND THE JOURNEY ITSELF IS NOT WHERE ALL THE NEURA PLASTICITY OCCURS WE KNOW THAT FOR SORE IN FACT IF YOU WAN'T IMAGINE HOW SYLICIBON AND OTHER PSYCHODELICS WORK TO CHANGE THE BRAIN THINK ABOUT THEM AS A WEDGE THAT GETS UNDERNEATH THE BOWULDER THAT IS THE NER PLASTICITY THAT GETS ROLLING FORWARD AND THEN THINK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE PLASTICITY IS ADAPTIVE OR MALADAPTIDE WHETHER NOT IT ACTUALLY SERVES YOU IN YOUR LIFE ON A DAILY BASIS OR NOT DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT YOU'RE USING YOUR CONSCIOUS BRAIN TO MOVE THAT BOWLDER IN A PARTICULAR DIRECTION I HAM NOT JUST BOLDOSING THROUGH THINGS IN DESTROYING THEM BUT CLEARING A PATH THROUGH OLD INEFFECTIVE MAYBE EVEN DESTRUCTIVE PATTERNS OF THOUGHTS OR EMOTIONS ET CETERA I GIVE YOU THAT ANALOGY BECAUSE I THINK IT MORE ACCURATELY CAPTORS WHAT PSYCHODELICS LIKE SYLIIVON ARE DOING RATHER THAN THE TYPICAL DISCUSSION AROUND PSYCHODELICS THAT WE TEND TO HEAR WHICH IS THAT OH IT CREATES PLASTICITY AND PLASTICITY IS WHAT YOU WANT FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF MINUTES I LIKE TO FOCUS ON SOME OF THE KEY AND STEREOTYPE THAT IS CHARACTERISTIC EXPERIENCES THAT PEOPLE TEND TO HAVE DURING THE SYLICIBAN JOURNEY ECAUSE THERE'S SOME REALLY INTERESTING RESEARCH ON THIS THESE ARE PHRASES THAT PERHAPS YOU'VE HEARD BEFORE THINGS LIKE LETTING GO EGO DISSOLUTION FEELINGS OF CONNECTEDNESS WHILE ALL OF THAT IS VERY SUBJECTIVE ON THE ONE HAND THOSE WORDS ARE HEARD OFTEN ENOUGH AND REPEATEDLY ENOUGH IN SYLICIVAN SESSIONS AND AFTER SYLICIVAN SESSIONS ALONG WITH THE SDESCRIPTION OF THE SYLICIBE AN EXPERIENCE AS ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND OF ONE'S LIFE OR ONE OF THE MOST POSITIVE IN THE IDEAL CASE OF ONE'S LIFE THAT THEY ARE WORTH EXPLORING WE SHOULD ALSO OF COURSE EXPLORE THE SO CALLED BAD TRIP THE POSSIBILITY THAT SOME ONE WILL HAVE A NOT GOOD TIME OR EVEN VERY FRIGHTENING TIME WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SYLICIVEN SO THERE HAVE BEEN SOME SCIENTIFIC STUDIES OF EXPLORED WHAT SORTS OF SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCES THAT IS THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS INSIHTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE THAT RELATE TO POSITIVE THERAPEUTIC OUTCOMES AND MORE GENERALLY WITH THE SENSE THAT THE SYLICIB AN JOURANY WAS POSITIVE OR MAY BE EVEN TREMENDOUSLY POSITIVE IN ONE'S LIFE SO WHILE THERE IS A CENTURY OR MORE OF WRITINGS ABOUT SYCHODELICS THAT DESCRIBE THINGS LIKE IN HANCEFEELINGS OF CONNECTEDNESS OR DISSOLUTION OF THE EGO THE LOSS OF ONE SENSE OF SELF AND THEN THE REGAINING OF ONE SENSE OF SELF AND SO ON THERE IS A PARTICULAR PAPER THAT DESCRIBES SOME OF THOSE THINGS IN TERMS OF RATING SCALES THAT IS THE SORTS OF TESTS THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE IN WHICH THEY ANSWER PARTICULAR QUESTIONS AND THAT LINK BACK TO THINGS LIKE FEELINGS OF CONNECTEDNESS IN EGO DISSOLUTION THAT ALLOWS US TO PUT SOME NUMBERS TO THOSE EXPERIENCES AND TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE STATISTICS ASSOCIATE WITH THOSE EXPERIENCES D THIS IS REALLY WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT SCIENTIFIC STUDIES WHETHER NOT A MEASURE IS SUBJECTIVE OF SOME ONE SELF REPORTING HOW THEY FELT OR FEEL OR WHETHER NOT ITS MEASURE OF BLOOD PRESSURE OR OR OF A CHEMICAL IN THE BLOOD STREAM ET CETERA IT'S THE USE OF NUMBERS IN STATISTICS THAT ALLOWS COMPARISON BETWEEN DIFFERENT GROUPS AND THAT CAN BE COMPARED BETWEEN STUDIES THAT ALLOWS US TO MAKE SOME FIRM CONCLUSIONS ABOUT WHAT SORTS OF THINGS SYLICIBON MAY OR MAY NOT BE DOING WHEN IT'S EFFECTIVE OR NOT SO THE PAPER I LIKE TO HIGHLIGT IS ENTITLED QUALITY OF ACUTE SYCHODELIC IC SPERIENCE PREDICTS THERAPUTIC EFFICACY OF SYLICIB AN FOR TREATMENT RESISTENT DEPRESSION I'LL PUT A LINK TO THIS PAPER IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS BUT THE BAS S IT CONTOUR OF THIS PAPER IS THAT THEY LOOKED AT SUBJECTS THAT UNDERWENT TWO DIFFERENT SYLICIVAN SESSIONS ONE AT A RELATIVELY LOW ISH DOSE OF TEN MILIGRAMS OF SYLIIVEN AND THAT WOULD BE EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT ONE GRAM OF SYCHODELIC MUSHROOMS MORE OR LESS AND A SECOND SESSION INVOLVING SUBJECTS TAKING TWENTY FIVE MILIGRAMS OF SYLICIVEN OR WHAT'S ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT TO SOMEBODY TAKING TWO AND A HALF GRAMS OF SYLICIVAN MUSHROOMS THOSE PEOPLE THEN ANSWERED WHAT'S CALLED THE ALTERED STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS QUESTION AIR WHICH ALLOW THEM TO ADDRESS AND HERE ON PARAPHRASING THE QUALITY OF EXPERIENCES IN THE TWENTY FIVE MILIGRAM SYLICIVE IN SESSION S WITHOUT GOING TO TOO MUCH DETAIL IT'S OFTEN THE CASE IN THESE SORTS OF TWO SESSION STUDIES THAT SUBJECTS WILL TAKE US SLIGHTLY LOWER DOSE OF SYLICIVEN TO FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES WITH THE EXPERIENCE AND THEN THE HIER DOSE THAT LEADS TO THE MORE INTENSE EXPERIENCE INTENSE MEANING A BIGGER MORE INTENSE PIK A LONGER SESSION OVER ALL GREATER DISTORTIONS IN EMOTIONALITY AND PERCEPTIONAL EXPERIENCE ALL THE STUFF WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE SO WHAT THIS STUDY FOUND IS THAT ONE OF THE KEY FEATURES IF NOT THE KEY FEATURE OF A POSITIVE QUOTIN QUOTE PSYCHODELIC EXPERIENCE IS THIS SENSE OF OCEANIC BOUNDLESSNESS OCCURRING AT SOME POINT DURING THE SYCHODELIC JOURNEY NOW OCEANIC BOUNDLESSNESS DOES IT NA SARELY MEAN ANYTHING TO ANY OF US AM IT PROVMEANS DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE UTTHIS IDEA THAT ONE IS EXPERIENCING SOMETHING EXTREMELY UNUSUAL EVEN MYSTICAL AND A BEYOND THIS WORLD AND ONE'S NORMAL EXPERIENCE BUT THAT IT'S NOT A LINED WITH ANY SPECIFIC OUTCOME IN THE MOMENT IT'S NOT DIRECTLY ATTACHED TO ANY ONE FEELING OR MEMORY OR THOUGHT PROCESSIS THIS IT'S A LOBIT TOUGH TO DESCRIBE BECAUSE I CAN GUARANT YOU I'M NOT ON SYLIIVEN OR ANY PSYCHODELICS RIGHT NOW AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE AM THAT YOUARE NOTALTHOUGH SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE I CAN EVEN IMAGINE WHAT THIS PODCASTWOOD A BE LIKE FOR SOMEBODY ON SYLICIVEN AT THIS MOMENT BUT IN ANY CASE OCEANIC BOUNDLESSNESS OF FEELING OF THE EXPERINCE BENG MYSTICAL AND NOT REALLY HEADING IN ANY ONE PARTICULAR DIRECTION JUST A FEELING OF MASSIVE CONNECTEDNESS WITH ONE'S ENVIRONMENT BOTH IN THE ROOM AND SESSION PERHAPS WITH THE GUIDES WITH ONE'S SELF WITH ONE'S PAST WITH ONES PRESENT PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE ROOM WITH THE ENTIRE WORLD MAYBEVEN THE UNIVERSE THAT SORT OF THING THE INTENSITY OF THAT EXPERIENCE OF OCEANIC BOUNDLESSNESS THE MYSTICAL EXPERIENCE SEEMS TO BE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH POSITIVE THERAPUTIC OUTCOMES THAT IS RELIEF FROM MAJOR DEPRESSION NOW DURING THE PSYCHODELIC JOURNEY AS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THEIRE NUMBER OF STEPS THAT ONE TYPICALLY GOES THROUGH SO THERE'S TO BUILD UP TO FIRST EXPERIENCING THE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG ABOUT MAY BE TWENTY TO FORTY FIVE MINUTES INTO THE JOURNEY OR TRIP THAN THE PEAK AND IT IS DURING THAT PAK THAT PEOPLE OFTEN FEEL THE SENSE OF OCEANIC BOUNDLESSNESS HOWEVER IT'S ALSO OFTEN THE CASE THAT IT IS DURING THE PEAK WITH A MAXIMUM INTENSITY OF EMOTION AND WE KNOW BASED ON DIRECT MEASUREMENTS ALSO INCREASES IN BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE OFTEN VERY SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN ANXIETY AND FEAR AS WELL THAT PEOPLE WILL EXPERIENCE THINGS LIKE EGO DISOLUTION AND THE GUIDES ROLL AT THAT POINT IS OF COURSE TO KEEP THE PERSON SAFE MAKE SURE THEY DON'T RUN OUT F THE ROOM JUMP OUT OF WINDOW RUN INTO TRAFFIC SADLY THESE ARE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED OUTSIDE OF A STRONG HEALTHY SAFE SET AND SETTING BUT THE GUIDES ROLL IS TO KEEP THE PERSON SAFE BUT ALSO TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO LET GO AND MOVE THROUGH THAT EXPERIENCE TO EXPERIENCE THE ANXIETY ALLOW ITS TO PEAK ALLOW THEM TO SEE THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DIE FROM THAT ANXIETY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DISSOLVE THEY WON'T LOSE THEIR SENSE OF SELF COMPLETELY OR THEY MAY TEMPORARILY FEEL AS IF THEY LOSE THEIR SENSE OF SELF BUT THEN THEY FEEL IT RESTORED AT VARIOUS INTERVALS URING THE PEAK OR AS THEY EXIT THAT PEAK AND MOVED TOWARD THE SAY SECOND THIRD FOURTH FIFTH HOUR OF THE SESSION SO WHEN EXACTLY THESE FEELINGS OF OCEANIC BOUNDLESSNESS AND EGO DISSOLUTION OCCUR VARIES FROM PERSON A PERSON BUT TYPICALLY IT'S DURING THE PEAK THAT THE EGO DISSOLUTION THE FEAR AND THE NEED TO QUOTINQOTE LET GO IS MOST TYPICAL I THINK PERHAPS THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE THE DATA IN THIS PAPER IN A WAY THAT'S MEANINGFUL TO EVERYBODY IS TO REFER YOU TO FIGURE TOO WHICH IF YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE PAPER I WON'T MEAN ANYTHING TOYOU BUT I'LL DESCRIBE IT IN IF YOU DO WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT FIGURE TO AGAIN YOU CAN ACCESS THE PAPER IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS WHAT THEY DID AS THEY LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SUBJECTIVE MEASURES THINGS LIKE EXPERIENCE OF UNITY THE FEELING THAT ONE IS CONNECTED TO OTHERS IN TO THE WORLD THINGS LIKE SPIRITUALITY WHETHEROR NOT THE WHOLE THING FELT LIKE A SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE WHETHER NOT IT WAS A BLISSFUL STATE WHETHER NOT THERE WERE INSIGHTS WHETHER NOT SOMEBODY FELT DISEMBODIED OUT OF BODY WHETHER NOT SOMEBODY HAD A LOT OF ANXIETY WHETHER NOT THEY HAD THESE CYNESESIAS THESE BLENDING OF VISUAL AUDITORY TOUCH AND BREATHING AND THINGS OF THAT SORT AND THEY ADDRESS WHICH OF THOSE MEASURES WRELATED TO THE POSITIVE CLINICAL OUTCOMES THAT WERE OBSERVED LATER AFTER THE SCILICIBON WERE OFF AND WHILE I'M NOT GOING TO GO POINT BY POINT THROUGH EACH ONE OF THESE MEASURES THERE'S A GENERAL FEATURE TO EMERGE FROM THE STUDY WHICH IS THAT THE EXPERIENCE OF UNITY THE SENSE THAT THE SILICIBON JOURNEY WAS SPIRITUAL AN EXPERIENCE OF BLISS AT SOME POINT INSIDE OF THE SILICIBON JOURNEY THE SENSE THAT THERE WERE INSIGHTS THAT THERE WERE LEARNINGS ABOUT ONE'S LIFE IN ONESELF WHEN THOSE THINGS WERE EXPERIENCED VERY STRONGLY THAT CORRELATED WITH THE PERSON BEING WHAT WAS CALLED A RESPONDER TO THE SILICIBON TREATMENT MEANING THEY GOT RELIEF FROM THEIR DEPRESSION WHEREAS PEOPLE WHO FELT LESS OF THAT O CASE O THE NON RESPONDERS AS THEY'RE CALLED THE PEOPLE DO NOT BENEFIT SO MUCH IN THE LONG RUN FROM THEE SILICIBON TREATMENT TEN DED TO REPORT LESS OF AN EXPERIENCE OF UNITY LESS OF A SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE LESS OF A BLISSFUL STATE LESS INSCIGHTFULNESS AND SO ON WHEREAS THERE WERE VERY FEW DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PEOPLE THAT DERIVED BENEFIT FROM THE SILICIVAN TREATMENT AND THOSE DID NOT ALONG THE DIVENTIONS OF CYNECESIA THIS BLENDING OF DIFFERENT PERCEPTIONS THAT ORDINARILY DOESN'T OCCUR FOR MOST PEOPLE OR COMPLEX IMAGERY RIGHT PUT SIMPLY EVERYONE WHO TOOK SILICIVON IN THE STUDY TWENTY FIVE MILIGRAMS SAW COMPLEX IMAGERY THEY SAW A LOT OF HALLUCINATIONS BUT JUST SEEING HALLUCINATIONS DID NOT LEAD TO THE POSITIVE CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF MOOD ANXIETY WAS A VERY INTERESTING MEASURE HERE BECAUSE ORDINARILY WE THINK OF THE EGO DISOLUTION THE LETTING GO IS SUCH A KEY COMPONENT OF THE SYCHODELIC JOURNEY IN TERMS OF THE POSITIVE THEIRAPEUTIC OUTCOMES THIS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED QUITE A LOT AND O IN FULL DISCLOSURE ROBIN CARTER AT HARRIS HAS ALREADY COME ON TO RECORD AN EPISODE OF THE HUBRAN LAPOTCAST ATEPISODE HASN'T BEEN RELEASED YET BUT IT WILL BE RELEASED SOON AND HE TALKS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS LETTING GO IN TERMS OF THE POSITIVE CLINICAL OUTCOMES OF THE SILICIVAN JOURNEY AND INDEED THAT IS TRUE A AND I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT DOCTOR MATTHEW JOHNSON FROM JOHN'S HOPKINS WHO ALSO RUNS HE LABORATORY EXPLORING PSYCHODELIXON THEIR ROLL IN TREATING THINGS LIKE EATING DISORDERS A'T DEPRESSION ET CETERA ALSO DOING INCREDIBLE WORK ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF LETTING GO DURING THE SILICIBANTRY THIS EGO DISOLUTION THIS ABILITY TO MOVE THROUGH THE ANXIETY AND AGAIN I CAN'T UNDERSCORE THIS ENOUGH BECAUSE IT'S BEEN TOLD TO ME OVER AND OVER AGAIN BY THE TAP RESEARCHERS IN THIS AREA THAT PEOPLE HEAD INTO THAT PIKING PHASE OF THE SILICIVAN JOURNEY AND OFTENTIMES IT IS NOT PLEASANT FOR THEM THEIR FEELING LIKE ITS UNCOMFORTABLE AT SCARY AND THEIR HEART RAITES UP AND THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE IS UP AND THEIR HAVING A HARD TIME CALMING DOWN THAN THEY WANT TO CALM DOWN BUT IT DOES SEEM THAT WHILE THE GUIDES SHOULD NOT RAMP THEM UP AND GET THEM MORE STRESSE THAT THE ABILITY TO MOVE THROUGH THAT STRESSFUL PERIOD SOMEWHAT GUIDE ONESSELF OR TO BE ENCOURAGED TO GUIDE ONESELF THROUGH THAT PEAK AND THAT ANXIETY AND THE FEAR OF LOSING ONESELF AND THE SO CALLED EGO DISSOLUTION THAT OCCURS IS AN IMPORTANT FEUTURE FOR AN EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC SESSION IN THIS STUDY ANXIETY ITSELF WAS INVERSELY CORRELATED WITH A POSITIVE THERAPEUTIC OUTCOME CASO THIS IS IMPORTANT AND SOMEWHAT NUANCE ON THE ONE HAND I'M TELLING YOU THAT THE LETTING GO THE EGO DISSOLUTION DOES SEEM TO BE IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF REPORTING A PSYCHODELIC EXPERIENCE AS EFFECTIVE AS HAVING ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING AND PERHAPS EVEN EXPLAINING SOME OF THE LONG TURN PAUSIVE EFFECTS TO EMERGE FROM THAT PSYCHODELIC JOURNEY IN THIS CASE SYLICIPON JOURNEY HOWEVER NON RESPONDERS THAT IS PEOPLE WHO DID SOLICIBON BUT DID NOT HAVE A POSITIVE THERAPEUTIC OUTCOME IN COMPARISON TO THE RESPONDERS THOSE NON RESPONDERS TENDED TO HAVE HIGHER SUBJECTIVE RATINGS OF ANXIETY THEN DID THE RESPONDERS SO THIS IS IMPORTANT AND WHAT IT SPEAKS TO IS THE FACT THAT WHILE YES LETTING GO DURING THE SESSION EXPERIENCING SOME ANXIETY PERHAPS EVEN EGO DISSOLUTION AND HE OF DISSOLVING OF SELF AND THEN THE RETURN OF SELF IS IMPORTANT IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT IT SEEMS THAT ANXIETY NOT BE SO SO HIGH OR SUBJECTIVELY EXPERIENCED AS SO HIGH THAT ONE DOES NOT EXPERIENCE THE POSITIVE NOURONAL REWIRING THAT LEADS TO A MORE PERVASIVE ELEVATED MOOD AS SO I'M DEFINLLY SAYING TWO THINGS AT ONCE BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO CAPTURE THE DATO ACCURATELY IT WOULD NOT BE FAIR FOR ME TO SAY JUST LET GO EXPERIENCE AS MUCH ANXIETY AS IS POSSIBLE AND THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS YES LETTING GO AGAIN IN AERQUOTE SEEMS TO BE A IMPORTANT FOR ONE'S EXPERIENCE OF THE PSYCHODELIC JOURNEY IN PARTICULAR ROUND THE PEAKE THAT OCCURS ABOUT TWO HOURS IN OR SO HOWEVER EXTREME LEVELS OF ANXIETY SEEM INVERSELY CORRELATED OR NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WOULD BE THE BETTER WAY TO PUT IT WITH THE POSITIVE THERAPEUTIC OUTCOME A RELIEF FROM DEPRESSION SO THIS TAKES US BACK T ALL OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THUS FAR NOT JUST THE CHEMISTRY AN BIOLOGICAL ACTION OF SYLIIBEN BUT THE KEY IMPORTANCE OF GETTING DO SAGE RIGHT THE KEY IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT BUT ALSO ONE IN WHICH THE GUIDES REALLY KNOW WHAT THEI'RE DOING I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE A BIGGEST AND MOST IMPORTANT REASONS FOR HAVING WELL TRAINED GUIDES THO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE CONTOUR OF THE PSYCHODELIC JOURNEY BUT ARE ALSO TRAINED IN HOW TO HELP SOMEBODY WITH THEIR ANXIETY IN REAL TIME WHILE THEIR UNDER THE EFFECTS OF SCYLICIBEN AND OF COURSE TO HELP PEOPLE INDEGRATE THOSE FEELINGS OF HIGH ANXIETY AND MAY BE GUIDE THEM BACK DOWN TO A CALMER STATE DURING THE PSYCHODELIC SESSION ITSELF HERE I CAN AJUST MENTION SOME UNPUBLISHED DATA AND STUDIES AND AGAIN THIS VERY PRELIMINARY BUT THROUGH DISCUSSIONS WITH DOCTOR MATTHEW JOHNSON WHO SE RUNNING THESE SYLICIBAN ANOTHER  SORTS OF PSYCHODELIC TRAALS AT JOHN'S HOPKINS HE AND I DISCUSS THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A REAL TIME TOOL TO ADJUST ANXIETY WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF PSYCHODELIC PSYCCYLICIBEN AND THERE HE ASKE AND THEY'VE STARTED TO INCORPORATE IS MY UNDERSTANDING SOME OF THE REAL TIME RESPIRATION TOOLS THAT IS BREATHING TOOLS THAT WE KNOW BASED ON WORK IN MY LABORATORY DOCTOR DAVID SPAGLE'S LABORATORY CAN REDUCE ANXIETY VERY QUICKLY IN REAL TIME AND THAT INVOLVES THE USE OF THE SO CALLED PHYSIOLOGICAL SIH IHAVE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THIS BEFORE ON PREVIOUS PODCASTS SO RATHER THAN EXPLAIN IT TOOU AGAIN HERE NOW WILL PUT A LINK TO THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIE I DO A DEMONSTRATION OF IT IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS I'LL ALSO LINK TO A RECENT PAPER THAT WE PUBLISHED IN SELL REPORTS MEDICINE THIS WAS A COLLABORATIVE WORK THAT MY LABORATORY DID WITH DOCTOR DAVID SPEGLE'S LABORATORY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE SHOWING THAT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE AMONG THE DIFFERENT DELIBERATE RESPIRATION TECHNIQUES ONE OF THE FASTEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO REDUCED LEVELS OF AUTONOMIC ARALSAL ACH A ANXIETY OR STRESS AND DOCTOR MATTHEW JOHNSON'S LABORATORIS STARTED TO INCORPORATE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE WITHIN THESE PSYCHODELIC SESSIONS AS A TOOL THAT THE GUIDES CAN REFER PEOPLE TO BEFORE THE SESSION BEGINS TEACHING IT TO THEM SO THEY REALIZE THEY CAN CALM THEMSELVES DOWN IF NECESSARY IN REAL TIME IT WORKS THE FIRST TIME IT WORKS EVERY TIME THIS IS NOT BECAUSE IT'S SOME MAGIC BREATHING TECHNIQUE THAT I CREATED IT CERTAINLY IS NOT THIS IS A NATURALLY OCCURRING PATTERN O BREATHING THAT CURS IN SLEEP AND IN WAKING BUT THAT WHEN DON DELIBERATELY LEADS TO VERY RAPID AND AM QUITE SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN STRESS AND ANXIETY AND THEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE INSIDE OF THE PSYCHODELIC SESSION IF THEY FEEL THEIR ANXIETY LEVELS ARE GOING TOO HIGH THEIR HEADING TOWARD WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED A QUOTINQUO BAD TRIP THEIR STARTING TO PANIC OR REALLY THINK THERE CAN HAVE A PANIC ATTACK OR DIE AGAIN THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCES CAN BE LAYERED ON TOP OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL EXPERIENCE OF ONE'S HEARTRATE BEING REALLY ELEVATED SAW A STRESS AND AGITATION BY USING THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIE INSIDE OF THE PSYCHODELIC SESSION DOCTOR JOHNSON'S LABORATORY AND I BELIEVE AT LEAST ONE OTHER LABORATORY ARE STRARTING TO USE BREATHING TECHNIQUE SUCH IS THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIE AS A WAY FOR THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SYLICIB INTO SELF DIRECT THEIR OWN CALM AND TO BRING THAT LEVEL OF ANXIETY DOWN SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO MOVE THROUGH THE PEAK AND MOVE THROUGH THE OTHER PHASES OF THE SYCHODELIC JOURNEIANG WAYS THAT CAN BE MOST BENEFICIAL FOR THEM SO TO CLOSE OUT THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS REALLY WONDERFUL STUDY AND BY THE WAY IT'S ANOTHER ONE FROM THE CARD HARD HAIRS LABORATORY ABOUT THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF EGO DISOLUTION OR OCEANIC BOUNDLESSNESS THIS MYSTICAL STATE AS SO KEY AS A COMPONENT OF A POSITIVE SYLIIBON JOURNEY I'LL JUST READ FEW THE FINAL SENTENCE OF THIS PAPER BECAUSE IT CAPTURES IT SO WELL QUOTE IT SEEMS VITAL THAT APPROPRIATE CONSIDERATION IS PAID TO THE IMPORTANCE OF PROMOTING A CERTAIN KIND OF EXPERIENCE AS THE QUALITY OF THAT EXPERIENCE MAY BE THE CRITICAL DETERMINANT OF THERAPEUTIC SUCCESS NOW BEFORE WE MOVE INTO WHAT WILL BE A VERY BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SOME OF THE OTHER REWIRING PHENOMENA THAT SYLICIBON CAN INDUCE AND THEN INTO SOME OF THE THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS OF SYLICIBEN AS THEY RELATE TO THESE RECENT REALLY EXCITING CLINICAL TRIALS FOR DEPRESSION AND ADDICTIVE DISORDERS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT I JUST WANT A CUE EVERYBODY TO A PAPER THAT I THINK MANY PEOPLE  WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT IN THINKING ABOUT SILICEIVEN AND I'LL PROVIDE A LINK TO THIS PAPER AS WELL IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS THIS PAPER IS ENTITLE THERAPUTIC USE OF SYLICIB IN PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION AND THIS IS A WONDERFUL PAPER BECAUSE IT REALLY GOES STEP BY STEP THROUGH THE FARMACOLOGY OF SYLICIVON OF WHICH YOU NOW UNDERSTAND A BIT BUT IT GOES IN TO A BIT MORE DETAIL BUT THEN IT ALSO REALLY NICELY DESCRIBES THE CONTOUR OF A SCYLICIBON SECTION IN WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE LEVEL CHEMISTRY EARLY MIDDLE PEAK AND TOWARD THE END OF THE SILICIVON SESSION AND THEN ALSO IMPORTANTLY GETS INTO ISSUES OF DOSAGE AND TRANSLATING FROM MUSHROOMS TO SILICIVON ITSELF TO SILISON IS I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER BUT IN A BIT MORE DETAIL IF YOU LIKE TO SEE THAT DETAIL AND THEN PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY THERE'S A SECTION ON CONTRA INDICATIONS WHERE IT POINTS OUT THAT OF COURSE WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT ERE BRESFEEDING PEOPLE WHO HAVE A PREDISPOSITION TO SYCHOSIS THOSE PEOPLE SHOULD REALLY AVOID THE USE OF SYLICIBON AND OTHER SYCHODELICS ENTIRELY IT ALSO TALKS ABOUT WHERE THE EVIDENCE IS STRONG MODERATE AND WEAK FOR THE USE OF SYLICIVON FOR TREATMENT OF VARIOUS DISORDERS AND I CAN JO SUMRISE THAT A VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE IT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING TO HEAD IN A FEW MINUTES WHICH IS THAT THE MOST EVIDENCE FOR POSITIVE THERAPUTIC OUTCOMES RESPONSE TO SIYLICEIVEN TAKIN AND CONDUCTED IN THE MANNER THAT WE'VE BEEN DESCRIBING TO DAY IN TERMS OF DOSAGE AND JOURNEY SET AND SETTING IS FOR CANCOR RELATED DEPRESSION CANCER RELATED ANXIETY AND TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION THAT'S WHERE MOST OF THE EVIDENCE RESIDES THERE'S ALSO SOME EVIDENCE FOR THE USE OF SCYLICIVON JOURNEYS AND AGAIN THIS IS TYPICALLY ONE OR TWO SYLICIBON JOURNEYS SPACE IN THE CASES OF TWO JOURNEYS ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO TWO WEEKS APART AND AGAIN WITH ALL THE SAME CONTOUR OF SUPPORT SEND SET AND SETTING THT WE'VE BEN TALKING ABOUT TO DAY AND THERE THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE FOR R IMPROVEMENT IN TERMS OF OUTCOMES IN ALTCOHOL USE DISORDER AND DEPENDENCE AND TOBACCO EDICTION AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S THE LEAST AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE ALTHOUGH THERE IS CLINICAL CRIAL SUPPORT FOR RELIEF OR PARTIAL RELIEF FOR OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER CLUSTER HEADACHES AND MY GRAINS AND DEMORALIZATION DUE TO AIDS DIAGNOSIS AND SO AND THIS PAPER HAS A LOT OF REALLY INTERESTING INFORMATION AND TERMS OF DIFFERENT CONDITIONS IN TERMS OF DOSAGE AND AGAIN CONTRAINTIGATIONS AND WHAT'S CALLED ADVERSE EVENTS WHAT SORTS OF BAD THINGS KAN AND DO HAPPEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SYLISIBEN AND OTHER TYPES OF PSYCHODELIC JOURNEYS BOTH JURING AND AFTER THOUGH SCYLISIVEN OR SYCHODELIC SESSIONS WILL TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THIS WHEN WE GO INTETO SOME OF THOSE CLINICAL STUDIES BECAUSE ADVERSE REACTIONS IS ALWAYS A KEY MEASURE IN ANY CLINICAL STUDY SO VERY SOON WE'LL GET INTO THE MORE RECENT CLINICAL STUDIES RELATED TO SYLISIBEN FOR THE USE OF TREATING DEPRESSION AND SOME OTHER CONDITIONS BUT WEFORE WE DO THAT I BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT HOW SYLISIVEN DOES AND DOES NOT CHANGE THE BRAIN WHAT IS IN WHAT IS NOT KNOWN ABOUT THAT IN FACT WHEN I PUT OUT THE CALL FOR QUESTIONS ABOUT SYLISIVEN MANY OF THE QUESTIONS RELATED TO THESE ISSUES THE FIRST THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT A SYLICIBEN JOURNEY IS REALLY A WAY TO TRY AND PUT THAT WEDGE UNDER THE BOULDER AS I DESCRIBED IT TO TRYING INVOKE NER APLASTICITY OF OUR PARTICULAR KIND IN THAT WAY IT'S CUN OF REMARKABLE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THAT EVERYONE HAS DIFFERENT LIVES DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES PSYCHODELICS IN THIS CASE SYLISIVEN ARE ACTIVATING THESE BRAIN NETWORKS THAT EACH OF US HAS MORE BROADLY THAN THEY WOULD NORMALLY BE ACTIVATED THESE ARE VERY ABNORMAL PATTERNS OF THINKING AND PERCEIVING AND EXPERIENCING OURE EMOTIONAL IN PHYSICAL LIFE ET CETERA AND YET SO OFTEN THE OUTCOMES ARE POSITIVE NOT ALWAYS BUT THE OUTCOMES ARE POSITIVE THE EXPERIENCE IS POSITIVE EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT HAVE THESE ANXIETY MOMENTS ARE COMPONENTS WITHIN THEM IT'S VERY IMPORTANTO UNDERSTAND THAT SYLICIVEN AND THE JOURNEY WHILE IN PORTANT ARE NOT REALLY WHAT ALL OF THIS IS ABOUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT NEUROL PLASTICITY SO RESEARCHERS IN PARTICULAR NUROSCIENTISTS ARE VERY INTENSELY INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT SORTS OF NEURO PLASTICITY SYLICIEAN CREATES BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THERE ALLOTS O IFFERENT TYPES OR PROCESSES INVOLVED WITH NEURO PLASTICITY FOR INSTANCE BRAIN NET WORKS BEHAVIOR THINKING EMOTION ET CETERA CAN CHANGE BECAUSE OF THE ADDITION OF NEW NURONS THAT'S ONE FORM OF NEURO PLASTICITY THAT'S REFERD TO ATS NEURO GENESIS THE PRODUCTION OF NEW NURONS MOST TYPICALLY IN THE SO CALLED DENTATE GYRIS WHERE OTHER SUBREGIONS OF THE HIPPOCAPUS O BRAIN AREA INVOLVED IN LEARNING AND MEMORY NEUROGENESIS IN OTHER REGIONS OF THE ADULT HUMAN BRAIN ARE EXCEEDINGLY RARE AND TO BE HONEST MAY NOT OCCUR AT ALL THIS IS A DEBATED AREA WE COUL DO AN ENTIRE EPISODE ABOUT THIS BUT FOR THE MOST PART NERO SCIENTISTS DON'T REALLY BELIEVE THAT YOUR NEO CORTAX YOUR STRIATUM YOUR SARABELLUM HAS THAT MUCH NEUROGENESISTS THAT'S RELATED TO LEARNING AND MEMORY OF NEW THINGS OR NEW EXPERIENCES AND WE DON'T ACTUALLY THINK THAT OCCURS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF TAKING SYLICIDE AN EITHER NOW SOME OF YOU WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH FOR INSTANCE THE SERABELLUM MIGHT BE SAING WAIT WHAT ABOUT GRANULAR SELF PRELIFERATION IN THE SARABELLUM OR WHAT ABOUT THE ROSTRAL MIGRATORY STREAM FROM THE SUBVRANE TRICULARSZOWN WHERE THEREARE NEURO BLASTS YOU SPITTING OUT LITTLE NW NURONS THAT MIGRATE INTO THE NOSE TO REPLENISH THE OL FACTORY NOR ON POPULATION YES THAT'S ALL TRUE THAT DOES OCCUR IT'S BEEN OBSERVED IN MICE IT'S BEEN OBSERVED IN MONKEYS AND TO SOME EXTENT IT'S BEEN OBSERVED IN HUMANS BUT IT'S NOT AGAIN I REPEAT IT IS NOT A PROMINENT FEATURE OF LEARNING AN ACQUISITION OF NEW SKILLS NEW IDEAS OR NEW EMOTIONAL STATES PERHAPS THE BEST SUPPORTED EVIDENCE FOR NEROGENESIS UNDERLYING NEW THOUGHTS EXPERIENCES ABILITIES EMOTIONS ET CETERA IS THE PRODUCTION OF NEW NURONS IN THAT DENTATE GYRIS SUBREGION OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS AND THAT PROBABLY DOES OCCUR IN HUMANS BUT NEUROGENESIS IS NOT REALLY THE DOMINANT MODE OF CHANGING NEURAL CIRCUITRY IN ADULT HUMANS IT MIGHT BE A PLAYER IN ADOLESCENCE IN YOUNG CHILDHOOD IT IS CERTAINLY A PLAYER BEFORE WE ARE BORN WHEN WE ARE STILL IN UTEROBUT THEN THE BRAIN IS BEING WIRED UP IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS INCLUDING THE ADDITION OF NEW NURONS IN CHANGING OF CONNECTIONS ALL THIS IS TO SAY THAT WHILE NEUROGENESIS IS A REALLY STICKY IDEA AND IT MAKES GREAT HEADLINES THE ADDITION OF NEW NEURANS IS NOT REALLY THE WAY THAT THE BRAIN CHANGES UNDER SCYLICIBON OTHER SYCHODELICS OR CUST GENERALLY IT'S PERHAPS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAY BE ONE TO TWO PER CENT AND ON BEING GENEROUS THERE OF THE REWIRING EVENTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE MOST IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US SO WE NEED TO SET THAT DOWN AND AND A CEMENT THAT THERE UNTIL FURTHER EVIDENCE COMES OUT TO THE CONTRARY THAT CERTAINLY WHERE I AND HERE I FEEL COMFORTABLE SPEAKING FOR TE MAJORITY OF NEUROSCIENTO SOUT THERE PROFESSIONAL NEROL SCIENTISTS THAT IS THE PAPER SHOWING ADULTNEROGENESIS ARE INTERESTING BUT THEY DON'T REALLY EXPLAIN MOST OF THE PLASTISY THAT OCCURS IN THE ADULT HUMAN BRAIN SO IF NEUROGENESIS AIN'T IT WHAT IS WELL IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT SYLICIBON OTHER PSYCHODELICS AND ANY SORT OF BEHAVIORAL OR DRUG INTERVENTION THAT CAN INDUCE NEURAL PLASTICITY DOES SO LARGELY THROUGH THE ADDITION OR STRENGTHENING OF NEW NERAL CONNECTIONS OR THROUGH THE ELIMINATION OR WEAKENING OF OTHER NEURAL CONNECTIONS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA EXPLORING THE MECHANISTIC BASIS FOR SYLICIBON INDUCE NEURAL PLASTICITY IT'S MOSTLY POCUSED ON ANIMAL BRAINS ANIMAL MODELS MICE AND RATS IN PARTICULAR A LITTLE BIT ON PRIMATES BUT MOSTLY MICE AND RATS BECAUSE THAT'S WORTHY INTERVENTIONS CAN BE DONE OF KNOCK OUT ANIMALS OF YOU IMAGING THE BRAIN IN REAL TIME COURSE THERE ARE THE BEAUTIFUL STUDIES OF ROBIN CARTART HARRIS AND OTHERS EXPLORING NEURL PLASTISTY AT THE LEVEL OF BRAIN IMAGING AT THE LEVEL OF UL CTROCOUND MEASUREMENTS OF NOW HOW ACTIVE ORE CERTAIN BRAIN AREAS IN HUMANS HOW EXTENSIVE AS YOU KNOW THE MODULARITY ORE NOT EXTENSIVE AS THE MODULARIET THAT ARE THE STUFF WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER SO AN OTHERWORDS THERE ARE NER PLASTICITY STUDIES THE EFFECTS OF SYLICIVON IN HUMANS BUT IN TERMS OF UNDERLING MECHANISMS OF NUROL PLASTICITY THINK THE PREDOMINANT THEORY IS THAT SYLICIVON INDUCES NURO PLASTICITY THROUGH THE EDDITION OF NOVEL CONNECTIONS IN THOSE PERAMINAL NURONS OF THE FRONTAL QUARTEC ELSEWHERE IN THE QUARTEX AND CERTAINLY ALSO IN THE VISUAL QUARTEX PROBABLY ALSO SUBCORTICALLY AS WELL BELOW THE CEREBRAL QUARTEX IN AREAS LIKE THE PHALYMAS MAY BEVEN IN THE BRAIN STEM AS WELL AND THAT THOSE NEROLPLASTESSY EVENTS ARE STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL AND THEY INVOLVE A COUPLE OF BASIC EVENTS THE MOST PROMINENT OF WHICH IS THE GROWTH OF DENDRITS DENDRITES ARE THOSE LITTLE BRANCHES ARE PROCESSES THAT COME OUT OF THE THE NURONS NOT JUST THE PERAMIDAL NURONS BUT OTHER NURONS AS WELL BUT SINCE WE'RE TALKING MAINLY ABOUT PERAMINAL NURONS TODAY BOTH THE APICA THOSE ONES THAT TOP THET CALLED THE APICAL TUFS OF THE ONES THAT REACH LATTERALLY TO CONNECT WITH OTHER NURONS COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER NURONS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE AS WELL AS THE DENDRITES THOT COME OUT OF THE BAS OF THOSE PERAMIDAL NURONS THOSE PROCESSES GROW IN RESPONSE TO SYLICIVON AS WELL AS THE EDDITION OF WHAT ARE ALLED DENDRIDIC SPINES SO THE DENDRITES ARE THE BRANCHES THE SPINES ARE THESE LITTLE PROTRUSIONS THAT GROW OUT THE ACTUALLY HERE IONOTHIS IS COINCIDENCE OR NOT AN  WAS SAY I WASN'T CONSULT THE DESINPHASE BUT THESE LITTLE PROTRUSIONS ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE LITTLE MUSHROOMS THEY HAVE A LITTLE STOCK AND THEYHAVE A LITTLE HEAD LLA SPINE HEAD AND THOSE LITTLE SPINES SO THINK THESE IS LIKE LITTLE TINY MUSHROOM APPEARING CAN THEY AREN'T ACTUAL MUSHROOMS HAV THE FIRST PERSON THAT PUTS IN THE COMMENTS OMAGINIS I LEARN TODAY THAT MUSHROOMS GROW OUT OF OUR NURONS WHEN WE TAKE MAGIC MUSHROOMS THAT IS NOT WHAT I AM SAYING WHAT IAM SAYING IS THAT THESE LITTLE MUSHROOM SHAPED PROTRUSIONS THAT WERE CALLING DENDRIDIC SPINES DO IN FACT GROW OUT OF DENDRTIC BRANCHES OF NURONS WHEN ANIMALS INJE SYLICIVON OR ARE INJECTED WITH SYLIS IBON AND THAT THOSE LITTLE MUSHROOM SHAPED PROTRUSIONS ARE THE SITES OF NEW EXCITATORY CONNECTIONS NEW LOCATIONS FOR IN PUT FROM OTHER NURONS TO ACTIVATE THOSE NURONS THAT HAVE THOSE LOW MUSHROOM SHAPED PROTRUSIONS IF YOU LIKE TO SEE EXAMPLES OF THIS BOTH MOVIES AND STILL SHOTS 'S PRETTY REMARKABLE THERE'S THA PAPER THELL PROVIDOLINK TO IN THE SHOWNO CAPTIONS AS PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL NURON SELPRESSTERNAL EXCELLENT JOURNAL ENTITLED SYLICIBON INDUCES RAPID END PERSISTENT GROWTH OF DENDERT C PINES IN THE FRONTAL QUARTECS IN VEVO SO THESE MEASUREMENTS ARE DONE IN THE MOUSE EQUIVALENT MORE OR LESS OF THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX THERE' SOME INTERESTING DETAILS IN THIS PAPER FOR INSTANCE THAT THOSE NEW CONNECTIONS PERSIST SO THEY DON'T JUST GROW OUT DURING THE SYLICEIBON BEING ACTIVE IN THE BLOOD STREAM AND BRAIN OF THE ANIMAL THEY PERSIST SO THIS MAY AGAIN MAY EXPLAIN SOME OF THE PERSISTENT CHANGES THAT OCCUR IN PEOPLE AFTER SILICEIVON JOURNEYS THEY MAY TOO GROW NEW SPINES I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF DENDRT IC PINES THESE LO MUSHROOM SHAPE PROTRUSIONS IN THE FRONTAL QUARTEC NURONS OF HUMANS OCCURS IN DEPRESSED PATIENTS WE KNOW THAT FROM POSTMORNEM TISSUE AND THAT DRUGS THAT RELIEVED DEPRESSION OR THAT TREATMENTS INCLUDING BEHAVIORAL TREATMENTS THAT PROVIDE SOME RELIEF FROM DEPRESSION DO SEEM TO BE CORRELATED WITH INCREASES IN SPINE GROWTH IN FRONTAL QUARTEXNERONS AS WELL SO THIS RAISES A VERY INTERESTING IDEA WHICH IS PERHAPS IT'S THE GROWTH OF NEW CONNECTIONS THESE NUW GENERT ECPINES IN PARTICULAR NURONS THAT'S CREATED BY ADMINISTRATION OF SYLISEIBON THAT EXPLAINS THE RELIEF FROM DEPRESSION THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE SO THIS IS JUST ONE PAPER BUT IT'S ONE PAPER OF A GROWING BODY OF WORK SHOWING THAT YES INDEED SYLICIBON INDUCES BOTH STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL PLASTICITY IN TE HUMAN AND ANIMAL BRAIN IT DOES THAT IN THE HUMAN BRAIN AT THERAPUTIC DOSES OF ANYWHERE FROM TEN TO TWENTY FIVE PERHAPS EVEN THIRTY MILIGRAMS PROCESSION WONER TO SESSIONS I SHOULD MENTION THAT THE MOUSE STUDIES TENDED TO USE QUITE HY DOSES OF SCYLICION I WAS I SHE IT WASN'T SHOCKED BUT I WAS SOMEWHAT A WIDE EYED FOR A MOMENT TO REALIZE THAT MOST OF THE STUDIES LOOKING AT CHANGES IN PLASTICITY IN THE MOUSE PRAIN IN RESPONSE TO PYLISIBON YOU THE EQUIVOLENT OF ONE MILIGRAM PER KILEGRAM OF BODYWEIGHT WHICH IS IF YOU DO THE MATH AND YOU TRANSLATE WHAT WE ARE TALKING OUT BEFOREIGN TERMS OF DOSAGES ALL JUST SPARE YOU ALL THE TIME IT'S ABOUT DOUBLE THE SORTS OF DOSAGES THAT AR TYPICALLY USED IN HUMANS MAYBE EVEN TRIPLE IN SOME CASES NOW IT'S OFTEN THE CASE IN ANIMAL STUDIES BECAUSE OF THE METABOLISM OF ANIMALS BEING DIFFERENT BUT ALSO BECAUSE YOU SEEING EFFECTS OF DRUGS IN ANIMAL STUDIES CAN BE DIFFICULT A THEY DID USE A DOSE RESPONSE ANYWHERE FROM ZERO TO ZERO POINT TO FIVE TO HALF TO ONE TO TWO MILEGRAMS FOR KILGRAM OF SYLICIBON IN THE STUDIES TO THE HAD A DOSE RESPONSE CURVED BUT FOCUS MAINLY ON THIS ONE MILEGRAM PRKILEGRAM DOSAGE IN ANY EVENT THE POINT IS THAT MANY OF THE STUDIES THAT DESCRIBE THESE PRETTY DRAMATIC STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN THE ANIMAL BRAIN MOST TYPICALLY THE MOUSE SPRAIN IN RESPONSE TO SYLICIBON USE DOSAGES OF SCYLICIBEN THAT IF TRANSLATED TO HUMANS WOULD BE ABOUT DOUBLE THE HUMAN THERAPEUTIC DOSE SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION NONE THE LESS IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT IN BOTH ANIMAL STUDIES AND HUMANS SCYLICIBON IS INDUCING BOTH STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL CHANGES IN BRAIN CIRCUITRY AND THAT IN HUMANS THE NETWORK CONECTIVITY IS BEING CHANGED DRAMATICALLY WE TALKED ABOUT THOSE DAYA EARLIER AND THAT THE UNDERLYING BASIS FOR THAT MIGHT BE AGAIN MIGHT BE WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE THE ADDITION OF NEW GENGERD IC SPINES ON THESE PERAMINAL NERONS WEVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT REPEATEDLY THROUGHOUT TO DAYS EPISODE ALTHOUGH NAROGENESIS PERHAPS AND OTHER MODES OF NEURO PLASTICITY SUCH AS THE ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN CONNECTIONS PERHAPS RELATED TO UNHEALTHY MALADAPTIDE THOUGHTS OR OUR FEELING THAT A PARICULAR SAD SONG IS OVERWHELMINGLY SAD IT COULD BE THE CASE THAT THOSE SORTS OF THINGS CHANGE SUBJECTIVELY BECAUSE OF THE REMOVAL OF NERAL CONNECTIONS IF YOUARE GOING TO THINK LIKE A NEUROBIOLOGIST OR SCIENTISTS FOR THAT MATTER YOU DON'T EVERY WONE TO THINK THAT ONE MECHANISM CAN EXPLAIN ALL THE EFFECTS OF A GIVEN DRUGARE GIVEN EXPERIENCES ALMOST CERTAINLY LIKELY TO BE THE CONSEQUENCE OF MULTIPL MECHANISMS ACTING IN PARALLEL AND BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WOULD LIKE TO KNOW EVEN MORE ABOUT THE NER PLASTICITY INDUCED BY PSYCHODELICS INCLUDING SYLISIVON THERE'S A WONDERFUL REVIEW THAT I PROVIDE A LINK TO IN THE SHONOTE CAPTIONS ENTITLED PSYCHODELICS AND NERL PLASTICITY A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW UNRAVELLING THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF PSYCHODELICS THIS REVIEW IS GREAT BECAUSE IT GOES A STEP BEYOND JUST SYLICIBON SILISON BINDING TO THE SERTONE INTO A RECEPTOR AND THINGS LIKE BRAIN DERIVE NETROPHIC TACTOR IT ACTUALLY TALKS A LOT ABOUT THE INTERECELLER SIGNALING AND EXACTLY HOW NERONS CHANGED THEIR EXCITABILITY PATTERNS BASED ON THIS ACTIVATION OF THE CERTONE INTO A RECEPTOR T'S PROBABLY MORE DETAIL THAN MOST OF YOU OUT THERE ARE INTERESTED BUT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL THIS IS A WONDERFUL OPEN ACCESS REVIEW SO A FEW MINUTES AGO I TALKED ABOUT WHERE THERE IS STRONG MODEST AND SOMEWHAT WEEK OR RATHER I SHOULD SAY MINIMAL EVIDENCE FOR THE THERAPEUTIC USE OF SYLISIBON TO TREAT VARIOUS DISORDERS AND ACROSS THE BOARD IT REALLY APPEARS THAT MAJOR DEPRESSION AND SO CALLED INTRACTABLE DEPRESSION IN SOME CASES IS WHERE WERE SEEING THE MOST EXCITING RESEARCH TO DATE NOW KEEP IN MIND THAT BECAUSE OF THE CONTROLLD SUBSTANCE ACT BEING INVOKED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY AND THE UNITED STATES AND BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY JUST A FEW YEARS AGO REALLY ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO THAT PSYCHODELICS INCLUDING SCYLICIBON RECEIVED WHAT'S CALLED BREAK THROUGH STATUS AT THE F D A THAT THERE ARE NOW A LOT OF CLINICAL TRIALS EXPLORING HOW SYLICIVON CAN IMPACT VARIOUS THINGS LIKE MOOD DISORDERS ADDICTIVE DISORDERS AND SO ON PRIOR TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN THAT THE RAPEUTIC BREAK THROUGH POTENTIAL WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE UNITED STATES THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE SO CALLEDPSYCHODELIC'S COMMUNITY HAD THE SENSE AND THAT REALLY THE BELIEF THAT THESE DRUGS HAD ENORMOUS POTENTIAL BUT THEY JUST WEREN'T BEING EXPLORED THAT EXTENSIVELY SO I DO WANT IM IM IVE A NOD TO THE INCREDIBLE RESEARCHERS IM SUCH AS ROBIN CARDART HARRIS BUT ALSO MATTHEW JOHNSON ROLLING GRIFIS NOLIN WILLIAMS AND MANY OTHERS CAM CERTAINLY NOT LISTING OFF EVERYBODY A THAT WOULD TAKE HOURS BUT THOSE RESEARCHES HAVE RALLY PIONEERED BOTH THE LEGAL EFFORTS AND THE FUNDING EFFORTS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE RESEARCH EFFORTS DEFINING THE CLINICAL DATA THAT I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE AND HERE I'M GOING TO SUMMARIZE THE CLINICAL DATA IN A BIT OF A TOP CONTOUR FASHION JUST GIVING YOU THE KIND OF HIGHLIGHTS WE WILL OF COURSE PROVIDE LYNX TO THE PAPERS IF YOU LIKE TO LOOK INTO IT FURTHER BUT I'M ONLY GIVING YOU THE TOP CONTOUR BECAUSE AVE HAD THE GREAT FORTUNE OF HAVING MATTHEW JOHNSON ON THIS PODCAST BEFORE YOU CAN FIND THAT EPISODE AT HUBERMAN LABDOK COM JUST SIMPLY PUT MAT'S NAME OR PSYCHODELICS INTO THE SEARCH FUNCTION IT'LL TAKE YOU TO THAT EPISODE IN ALL FORMATS OR LINXTALL FORMATS RATHER I'VE ALSO HAD THE GREAT FORTUNE OF SITTING DOWN RECENTLY WITH DOCTOR ROBIN CARDART HARRIS TO TALK ABOUT HIS WORK AT UNIVERSIY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO ON SYLICIBE AN ELIS T IOWASKA AND D M T AS IT RELATES TO DEPRESSION AND OTHER DISORDERS AND THAT EPISODE WHICH ALSO WILL BE RELEASED AT HUBERMAN LABDO COMMEND ON ALL PLATFORMS YOU DO BAPPLE SPODIFY REALLY GOES IN DEPTH INTO THESE CLINICAL STUDIES AND WHAT THOSE STUDIES REALLY LOOK LIKE UNOW WHOS IN THE ROOM WHETHER NOT PEOPLE JUST GET ONE DOSE OR TWO DOSES HOW FAR PARTHOS ARE I'M SEPARATED ALL OF THAT IS COVERED IN EXTENSIVE DETAIL IN THAT WHAT I FOUND TO BE WONDERFUL DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR ROBIN CARTART HARRIS SO I'M IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN ALL OF THE DETAILS AS IT RELATES TO CLINICAL APPLICATION OF PSYCHODOLICS AM STATUNE FOR THAT EPISODE SOON AGAIN YOU CAN FIND THAT AT HUBERMAN LADOK CAM AND ON ALL PLATFORMS IN THE MEANTIME I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T INCLUDE A BIT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN TERMS OF USING SYLICIBE AN JEURNEYS TAS A WAY TO TREAT DEPRESSION BECAUSE THE DATA ARE JUST O SO EXCITING AGAIN THESE DATE A REALLY START TO SURFACE AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF STUDIES THAT WERE INITIATED O ROUND TWO THOUSAND SIX IN JUST OF FEW SELECT LABORATORIES AND THEN REALLY PICKED UP IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF LABORATORIES AND NUMBER OF STUDIES BETWEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND NOW SO WHAT YO'LL NOTIE IS THAT MOST OF THE PAPERS I 'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBED WERE PUBLISHED IN FOR INSTANCE PHENOMENAL JOURNALS NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL MEDICINE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE A NEW ENGLAND JOUNAL MEDICINE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO OF JOURNAL OF THE MANERCAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SYCHIATRY JUST VERY RECENTLY TWENTY TWENTY ONCE THESE ARE VERY RECENT PAPERS ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THESE CLINICAL STUDIES INVOLVE EITHER ONE OR TWO SILICIVON SESSIONS THE DOSAGES THAT WERE EXPLORED RANGE FROM ZERO MILIGRAMS THE PLOCIBO IF YOU WILL TEN MILIGRAMS SOME CASES TWENTY FIVE MILIGRAMS IN SOME CASES THIRTY MILIGRAMS AND MOST TYPICALLY PEOPLE RECEIVED THE SAME DOSAGE FOR BOTH SESSIONS IF INDEED THEY DID BOTH SESSIONS HOWEVER THERE'S AT LEAST ONE STUDY LOOKING AT JUST ONE SINGLE EPISODE OF SCYLICIVON ADMINISTRATION SO THIS IS THE PAPER ENTITLED NO SURPRISE SINGLE DOSE SYLICIVON FOR TREATMENT RESISTANT EPISODE OF MAJOR DEPRESSION AS PUBLISHED IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL MEDICIN IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO I'LL JUST SUMMERIZE THE RESULTS OF THIS SINGLE APPLICATION STUDY THEY RANDABLLY ASSIGNED SUBJECTS WHO HAD TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION SO THEY'D RESISTED TREATMENT TO OTHER THINGS TO RECEIVE A SINGLE DOSE OF A SYNTHETIC FORMULATION OF SYLICVEN SO THEY'RE NOT EATING MUSHROOMS THERE GETTING A SYNTHETIC DOSE OF SYLICIVON BUT THE DOSE IS KNOWN OF EITHER TWENTY FIVE MILIGRAMS TEN MILIGRAMS OR ONE MILIGRAM WHICH WAS THE CONTROL AND THEY RECEIVE SYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT THERE WERE NUMBER DIFFERENT TESTS SUBJECTIVE TESTS OF DEPRESSION TAKE IN BEFORE AND AFTER THE SILCIVON JOURNEY THEY HAD ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE TO SEVENTY NINE PARTICIPANTS IN EACH GROUP TEN AT THE THREE DIFFRENT DOSE IS TWENTY FIVE TEN OR ONE MILIGRAM AND THEY LOOKED AT THE CHANGES IN THESE SCORES THESE DEPRESSION RELATED SCORES ON THESE TESTS THERE ARE MANY RESULTS FROM THIS PAPER ONE COULD SUMRISE BUT AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT RESULTS I CAN SUMRISE FROM THE DISCUSSION AND HERE ON PARIPHRASING THAT THE CHANGE IN BASE LINE LEVELS OF DEPRESSION THAT IS AT WEEK THREE FOLLOWING THE SYLICIDE IN SESSION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAT IS PEOPLE EXPERIENCED MORE RELIEF OR MORE PEOPLE EXPERIENCED MORE RELIEF FROM THE TWENTY FIVE MILIGRAM DOSE THAN FROM THE ONE MILIGRAM DOSE AND THIS IS IMPORTANT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TEN MILIGRAM DOSE AND THE ONE MILIGRAM DOSE THIS REALLY POINTS TO THE FACT THAT THE TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY MILIGRAM DOSE THAT'S USED IN THE LARGEST NUMBERS OF STUDIES EXPLORING TREAMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION REALLY SEEMS TO BE I DON'T I SAY THE BEST DOSE BUT THE MOST EFFECTIVE DOSE AT LEAST IN THIS CLINICAL CONTEXT IN THIS SET IN SETTING AND WITH THIS PARTICULAR PATIENT POPULATION SO WE WANT TO BE CAREFUL TO SAY THAT SO THAT ONE DOESN'T JUST TRANSLATE THE TWENTY FIVE MILIGRAMS IS BETTER THAN TEN MILIGRAMS ALTHOUGH IN THIS STUDY IT WAS FORSAKE OF TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION RELIEF THERE WERE NUMBER OF OTHER KEY ASPECTS OF THIS PAPER IN PARTICULAR THE EXPLORATION OF SO CALLE ADVERSE EVENTS SOETHINGS LIKE HEADACHES PROPENSITY FOR SELF HARM ACTUAL SELF HARM ANXIETY AND SO ON IT'S WORTH MENTIONING THAT THERE WERE ADVERSE EVENTS IN ESSENTIALLY EVERY GROUP THE NUMBER OF ADVERSE EVENTS WAS HIGHEST IN THE TWENTY FIVE MILIGRAM DOSE GROUP THIS IS OBSERVED IN OTHER STUDIES AS WELL WITH HIRER DOSAGES THERE TENDS TO BE GREATER RELIEF FROM DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS BUT ALSO A GREATER CHANTE FOR ADVERSE EVENTS SOME OF THOSE ADVERSE EVENTS CAN BE QUITE SEVERE SO FEELWINGS OF SUICIDAL IDIATION ET CETERA SOME OF THEM ONE COULD CONSIDER THE LESS SEVERE MILD HEADACHE OR SEVERE HEADACHE THAT WAS TRANSIENT WERE ANXIETY THAT WAS TRANSINT AGAIN HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL RESPONSES WE COULD GO LINE BY LINE AND TABLE BY TABLE THR OUGH THIS A PAPER WHICH WE WON'T BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF DATA AGAIN WILL PROVIDE A LINKE THIS PAPER OF YOU LIKE TO A PERUSE IT YOURSELF IT'S FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO READ THAT'S ONE THING THAT'S NICE ABOUT THESE A CLINICAL TRIALS AS THEY TEN TO BE WRITTEN IN FAIRLY NON TECHNICAL LANGUAGE OR THER THERE'S A LITLE BIT OF TECHNICAL LANGUAGE THE IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT A SINGLE DOSE OF TWENTY FIVE MILIGRAMS OF SILICIVAN PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT RELIEF FROM TREATMENT OF RESISTANT DEPRESSION IN THIS PARTICULAR PATIENT POPULATION BUT IT IS NOT THE CASE THAT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO TOOK TWENTY FIVE MILIGRAMS OF SILICIVEN EXPERIENCED THAT RELIEF HOWEVER THE MAJORITY OF THEM DID NOW WHEN YOU SAY MAJORITY IN SCIENCE YOU RELEY ME TO LOOK TO NUMBERS AND THE REASON I AM NOT TELLING YOU OH IT WAS SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OR SIXTY PER CENTER FIFTY PER CENT IS BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON WHICH TIME POINT PEOPLE WERE ANALYZED PEOPLE WERE ASKED ABOUT THEIR LEVEL OF DEPRESSION RELIEF IMMEDIATELY AFTER ONE WEEK AFTER TWO WEEKS AFTER THREE WEEKS AFTER AND THE DEGREE OF RELIEF TENDED TO CHANGE OVER TIME IN FACT IT TENDED TO DIMINISH OVER TIME BUT IT WAS ALSO STABLE OR REMARKABLY STABLE I SHOULD SAY AT LEAST BY MY READ IN THE TWENTY FIVE MILIGRAM DOSE GROUP AND THAT IS SUMRISE NICELY IN FIGURE TWO OF THE PAPER BECAUSE THEY EXPLORED THESE PEOPLE'S LEVELS OF DEPRESSION OUT TO WEEK TWELVE AND THEY STILL SAW A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF DEPRESSION RELIEF TWELVE WEEKS AFTER THE SINGLE TWENTY FIVE MILIGRAM SCILICIVEN DOS SESSION SO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THERE ARE NOW ABOUT A DOZEN OR SO EXCELLENT STUDIES CLINICAL TRIALS EXPLORING THE USE OF SINGLE OR TWO SESSION SYLICIAN TREATMENT IN THAT TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY MILIGRAM RANGE WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE DOSE FOR LONG LASTING RELIEF FROM DEPRESSION EACH ONE OF THOSE STUDIES EXPLORED SOMETHING DIFFERENT AS IS IMPORTANT REPLICATION IS ALSO IMPORTANT OF COURSE IN ORDER TO VALIDATE PREVIOUS STUDIES BUT FOR INSINCE THEREHAVE BEEN COMPARISONS OF SILICIBEN VERSES ESSESSORISE OR OTHER ANTO DEPRESSENTS THERE'VE BEEN COMPARISONS OF SILICIBEN PLUS PSYCHONALYSIS OR COGNIV BEHAVIOR ALTHERAPY VERSES COGNA BEHAVIORAL THERAPY ALONE OR PSYCHONALYSIS ALONE AND SO THERE IS A LOT OF EVALUATION NOW OF THE CLINICAL OUTCOMES AND THE STATISTICAL OUTCOMES OF THESE SUBJECTIVE MEASURES AND EVEN SOME OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF NAROCHEMISTRY WHERE THAT'S POSSIBLE INTERMS OF TRYIN O UNDERSTAND IF AND HOW SCYLICIVON IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE TREATMENT DEPRESSION AND THE MAJOR TAKE AWAY IS THAT INDEED IT DOES SEEM TO BE THE CASE AND THE NUMBERS THAT I FEEL COMFORTABLE NOT THROWING OUT THEIR BUT PUTTING OUT TO YOU REFLECT MY CONVERSATION WITH ROBIN CART HART HARRIS AGAIN THAT WILL BE RELEASED SOON AT HURM LAVDOUT CALM AS WELL AS TAKE AWAYS FROM WHAT I WOULD SAY ARE THE SIX BROADEST STUDIES MEANING THE HAVE THE WHIDISH RANGE OF AGE GROUPS THE BROADEST DEMOGRAPHIC IN TERMS OF THE SUBJECTS THEIR BACKGROUNDS THER LEVELS OF EDUCATION MEN WOMEN ETHNICITY ET CETERA AND A LOT OF THAT CAN BE SUMMARIZED IN THE PAPER ENTITLED EFFECTS OF SYLICIB AND ASSISTENT THERAPE ON MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER SO AS A PARTICULAR RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL BUT IN THE DISCUSSION I THINK THEY SUMMARIZE IT QUITE WELL WHICH IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO TAKE THIS TWENTY FIVE MILIGRAM DOSE TWICE IN SESSION SPACE ABOUT A WEEK APART WHAT YOU WILL FIND IS THAT ANYWHERE FROM SIXTY TO SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER WHO DO THESE SYLICIBIN SESSIONS IN THE PROPER SETTING REPORT A GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH IT HAVE MINIMAL ADVERSE EVENTS COMING OUT OF THOSE SESSIONS AND IN THE WEEKS FOLLOWING THOSE PEOPLE EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL POSITIVE RELIEF FROM MAJOR DEPRESSION IN WAYS THAT OTHER TREATMENTS THAT THEY EXPLORED INCLUDING INTO DEPRESSINT DRUGS COGNA BEHAVIORL THERAPY AND OTHER TYPES OF THERAPY ALONE COULD NOT PROVIDE NOW IT'S A GENERAL FEATURE OF THESE CLINICAL TRIALS FOCUSSING ON SYLISIBON THAT PEOPLE ARE ASK TO STOP TAKING THEIR ANTIDEPRESSENTS PRIOR TO PARTICIPATING IN THE TRIAL ITS ALSO A GENERAL FEATURE OF THESE TRIALS THAT PEOPLE ARE ENCOURAGED TO NOT SUDDENLY START THEIR ANTEDEPRESSIN TREATMENT IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS BECAUSE OF COURSE THAT COULD CONFOUND THE RESULTS OF THE SYLICIPAN TREATMENT HOWEVER AND THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE ALL SUBJECTS WERE ENCOURAGE NOT TO AVOID TAKING THOSE ANTITE PRESENT MEDICATIONS IF IN FACT THEIR CLINITION FELT THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THEIR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM SURVIVAL SO YO NO ONE SHOULD BE RECKLESS IN THINKING ABOUT WHAT TO ADD OR DELET FROM THEIR DRUG PROTOCOL WHEN DEALING WITH DEPRESSIONRI THE OUTCOMES COULD BE VERY SEVERE IN THAT CASE NONE THE LESS WE CAN PARAPHRASE FROM THE DISCUSSION OF THE PAPER I JUST MENTION BECAUSE IT REALLY HIHLITES THE INCREDIBLE RESULTS THAT SYLICIEBEEN APPLIED IN THESE PARTICULAR THERAPUTIC SETTINGS ARE PROVIDING AND HERE AGAIN ON PERAPHRISING THE PRESENT TRIAL SHOWED THAT SYLICIBON ADMINISTERED IN THE CONTECTS OF SUPPORTIVE PSYCHOTHERAPY CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN HOURS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY SO THIS IS CAN OBY TWO SESSIONS OF THE SYLICIBON WITH PROPER THERAPEUTIC SUPPORT PRODUCED LARGE RAPID AND SUSTAINED ANTI DEPRESSIN EFFECTS THE EFFECT SIZES REPORTED IN THE STUDY WERE APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT FIVE TIMES GREATER THAN THE EFFECTS SIZES FOUND IN PSYCHOTHERAPY AND MORE THAN FOUR TIMES GREATER THAN THE EFFECT SIZES FOUND IN PSYCHOPHARMICOLOGIC DEPRESSION TREAMENT STUDIES IN OTHER WORDS FOUR TIMES THE POSITIVE EFFECT OBSERVED WITH TYPICAL ESSESSORISE OR OTHER PHARMOCOLOGY OF THAT SORT THESE FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE LITERATURE THAT SHOWED THAT COMBINED PHARMICOTHERAPY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY WERE MORE EFFICACIOUS IN THE TREATMENT OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER THAN EITHER INTERVENTION ALONE AGAIN THIS POINTS OF THE FACT THAT COMBINING DRUG THERAPY WITH TALC THERAPY AS IT'S OFTEN CALLED IS GOING TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN EITHER TREATMENT ALONE HERE THE DRUG THERAPY IS SYLIIPONTHERAPY AND AGAIN PLEASE DON'T TAKE THE F ACT THAT IN THESE STUDIES THEY TENDED TO ASK PEOPLE TO NOT TAKE THEIR INTOTO PRESENT MEDICATION HEADING INTO THE STUDY AS A SIGN THAT ONE SHOULD STOP TAKING THEIR ENTITO PRESENT MEDICATION RATHER THINK THIS STUDY AND OTHER STUDIES LIKE IT AGAIN WHICH WILL PROVIDE LINKS TO IN THE SHOWNOT CAPTIONS THAT ARE DISCUSSED EXTENSIVELY IN THE EPISODE WITH DOCTOR CARTART HARRIS SOON TO COME REALLY POINT TO THE INCREDIBLE ROLL THAT SYLICIVEN CAN HAVE IN CREATING AN EXPERIENCE INSIDE OF THE SESSION THE JERANY OR THE TRIP AS IT'S CALLED AS WELL AS INITIATING NEURO PLASTIC EVENTS PERHAPS THE ADITION OF DENDRED EXPINDS MAYBE EVEN NEW NEURONS MAYBE ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE PREDOMINANT MODE BUT THAT LEADS TO THESE MORE EXTENSIVE CONOCTIVITIES IN THE BRAIN IS SO CALLED REDUCTION IN MODULAR NET WORKS ENHANCED ACTIVITY IN BRAIN AIRAS THAT NORMALLY WOULDN'T BE TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER BUT NOT DOING THAT IN ANY KIND OF HAPHAZARD WAY IT REALLY DOES SEEM THAT THE ONE OR TWO SESSIONS OF SYLICIVEN THAT INDUCE THESE FEELINGS OF EGO DISOLUTION THAT INDUCE THESE FEELINGS OF OCEANIC BOUNDLESSNESS RIGHT SO MYSTICAL AND IN MANY WAYS IT'S WHAT I FIND SO INCREDIBLE ABOUT SYLICIVEN AND OTHER PSYCHODELICS IS THAT DESPITE THE HIGHLY MYSTICAL HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE AND STILL AT THIS TIME SOMEWHAT TOP CONTOUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THEY MIGHT EXERT THEIR EFFECTS YOU CAN HIGLIT BOLD FACE AND UNDERLINE MIGHT THERE IT BECAUSE IT HASN'T REALLY BEEN FIRMLY ESTABLISHED WHAT THE EXACT SELLBIOLOGICAL REWIRING EVENTS ARE BUT THERE IS NOW WHAT I WOULD REFER TO AS HA CENTER OF MASS OF DATA THAT POINT TO THE FACT THAT SYLICIVEN WHEN TAKEN IN THE APPROPRIATE SET AND SETTING THE PPROPRIATE DOSAGES CAN INVOKE THE SORTS OF NEUROPLASTICITY AND CHANGES IN EMOTIONALITY IN PERCEPTIOAL EXPERIENCE NOTCHUST DURING THE PSYCHODELIC SESSION BUT FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME AFTER THE PSYCHODELIC SESSION THAT CAN PROVIDE REALLY REMARKABLE RELIEF FROM THINGS LIKE MAJOR DEPRESSTION AND PERHAPS OTHER PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES AS WELL AND OF COURSE I REALIZE THAT MANY OF YOU ARE LISTENING TO AND ARE WATCHING THIS EPISOD D AND YOU'RE NOT NECESSARILY DEPRESSED OR THINKING ABOUT PSYCHODELICS LIKE SYLICIBEN IN THE CONTEXTS OF DEPRESSION I HOPE TODAY'S DISCUSSION ALLOWED YOU TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW SYCHODELICS AND SYLIIBEN IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ARE ABLE TO EXERT THESE INCREDIBLE EFFECTS THAT THEY SEEM TO EXERT THIS IS NOT A CALL FOR EVERYONE TO RUN OUT AND DO SYLISIBON IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THAT IT IS HOWEVER MY ATTEMPT TO REALLY PUT A MAGNIFYING LENDS ON THIS INCREDIBLE AREA RECEARCH THAT'S HAPPENING NOT JUST IN THE CONTEXT OF CLINICAL TRIALS BUT IN THE CONTEXTS OF CHINA UNDERSTAND HOW SERATONAN AND HOW DRUGS LIKE SYLISION WHICH MANY WAYS MIMICS ARETONAN AND MORE PARTICULARLY THE ACTIVATION OF PARTICULAR RECEPTORS IN THE BRAIN LIKE THE SERETONE AN TWO A RECEPTR MA JUST SIT BACK AND THINK ABOUT THAT THE SELECTIVE ACTIVATION OF THIS RECEPTOR WHICH IS BY THE WAY ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPANSION OF THE NEO QUARTETS ACROSS EVOLUTION DIDN'T MENTION THAT BEFORE BUT INDEED IT IS HOW THAT CAN LEAD TO ENHANCED WAYS OF THINKING CHANGED WAYS OF THINKING ACTUAL LEARNING INSIDE OF THIS SHORT FOUR HOUR OR SIX OUR CESSION THAT WE CALL THE SYLISIBON JOURNEY SO AS IS OFTEN THE CASE PERHAPS AS IS ALWAYS THE CASE YOURE ON THE HUBRN LABADCAS WE DID A DEEP DIVE INTO A TOPIC TO DAY INTO THE TOPIC OF SYLICIBON WHAT IT IS HOW IT WORKS THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH CHANGE HIS BRAIN CIRCUITRY HOW IT CREATES THE EXPERIENCES THAT WE THINK OF AS THE SCYLISIBON JOURNEY WHAT THE SAFETY ISSUES ARE WHAT THE SO CALLED SET AND SETTING ARE THAT CAN LEND THEMSELVES TO POSITIVE THERAPEUTIC OUTCOMES AND IN DOING SO MY GOAL WAS REALLY TO HIGHLIGHT SEVERAL THINGS FIRST OF ALL I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR PSYCHODELIC SUCH A SYLISIBON TO PROVIDE RELIEF FOR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT TO DATE HAVE BEEN VERY HARD FOR PEOPLE TO ACESS IN ADDITION TO THAT I'M JUST FUNDAMENTALLY INTERESTED IN THE BRAIN AND HOW IT WORKS AND HOW IT CAN CHANGE THES THING WE CALL NEURO PLASTICITY TO ME NOR PLASTISY IS THE HOLY GRAIL OF THE HUMAN NERVOUS SYSTEM AS FAR AS WE KNOW WE ARE THE ANIMAL THAT CAN HAVE LONG LASTING NEUROPLASTO SEE THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPAN AND IF YIT REQUIRES THE USE OF COMPOUNDS IN A SAFE AND CONTROLLED WAY SUCH AS SCYLICIBON IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUL PLASTESY IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME THAT'S EXCITING BUT OF COURSE THAT ALSO NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED WITH ALL OF THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS IN MIND THAT WE TALK ABOUT EARLY INCLUDING THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE A PREDISPOSITION OR WHO HAVE PSYCHOSIS OR BY PULLAR DISORDER OR RELATIVE THAT HAS PSYCHOSIS OR BY PULLAR DISORDER YOUNGER PEOPLE MANING PEOPLE TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER AND REALLY ANYONE WHO'S NOT WORKING WITH A DEDICATED AND HIGHLY TRAINED PHYSICIAN NES TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT THESE COMPOUNDS AS WELL THEY'RE VERY EXCITING I THINK SILL CSIVON ISN'T EXCITING IN SUPERINTERESTING COMPOUND FOR BASIC AND CLINICAL REASONS AND FOR OTHER REASONS AS WELL BUT THEY ARE SHARP BLADES AS WE SAY AND WITH SHARP BLADES YOU CAN DO INCREDIBLE THINGS BUT YOU CAN ALSO CUT YOURSELF VERY BADLY SO ALL THOSE CONSIDERATIONS NEED TO BE TAKEN TO MIND SO I  CONSIDER THE SCIENCE AND USE OF SYLICIBON TO BE AN EXCITING BUT STILL PRELIMINARY AREA THAT I CERTAINLY AN PAYING A LOT OF ATTENTION TO AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT SO STATONE FOR THE EPISODE WITH DOCTOR ROBIN CARDART HARRIS AND WE WILL PROBABLY REVISIT SYLICIBON AND WE WILL CERTAINLY REVISIT THE OTHER PSYCHODELICS AND NONCLASICAL PSYCHODELICS INCLUDING ELS T D M T FIVE MI O D M T KETAMEN EMDY

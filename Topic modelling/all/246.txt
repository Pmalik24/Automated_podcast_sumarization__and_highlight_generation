YOU' OF OF ALL F THE POSSIBLE PROBABLE OUTCOMES OF A GLOBLE PANDAMAC MY DOG DYING IS NOT ONE THAT I COULT AF EVER IMAGINED THERE'S CERTAIN CONSEQUENCES OF THE PANDAMIC TAT WE ALL KNOW I WERE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND AMERICANS DEAD MILLIANS PEOPLE OUT OF WORK HET'S EVERYWHERE HAVING TESE TERRIBLE SCHOOL YEARS WAS DISTANT LEARNING BUT THERE ALL THESE OTHER WAYS THE VIRUS AS ALTERED AND SHAPED OR LIVES IT'S RIKNLY THIS WOMAN SINDY AND LINCON NA BRASKA BY THE SHING IT HPPENED A FEW DAYS AFTER A DAD DAED OF COVET SHE'S BONING HER MANY TEN INTO THE GRAGE AND REALISED ARIGHT MY DAD HE'SN'T GOING TO TEACH MY SON TO DRIVE I THINK IT WAS I WAS JUST PARKING I THINK I WAS PARKING MY OWN CAR AND YOU KNOW PUTTING MY HANDS ON THE KEYS AND JUST THINKING AWAIT THA THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT WERE GOOD OF MISS NOW ERS ON HARRISON ARE A AD WERE REALLY CLOSE AN SHE'V GOT GOOD KNOWING THAT A DAD WAS GOING T TEACH HIM TO DRIVE AS HARRISONS REALLY SMART AND FUNNY BUT NOT EVERYBODY GETS HIM AND HEAN MY DAD REALLY GOT EACH OTHER AND THEY COULD JUST LIKE HANG OUT MAK FUNNY JOKES ASK QUESTIONS QUIZ EACH OTHER A AS 'T MAT IFFACT I WAS JUST LOOKING I HAVE  THERE'S A TOY PLASTIC SOLDIER SITTING OWN MY DESK E DADDET OPEN OUR SURGERY HARRISON BROUGHT A FEW OF THESE LITTLE PLASTIC GREEN SOLDIERS TO HIS HOSPITAL ROOM AND SAID THESE WILL PROTECT YOU WHY YOU'RE HOSPITAL GREAT  AND SO MY DAD STARTED STAGING LIKE

THOUGHTS ABOUT GOSSIP IF IM RACHEL CONWAYS ESSAY THAT INSPIRED THIS STORY AND HASLET TAS HER FIRS CAME OUT IS PRETTY DELIGHTFUL IT IS CALLED THE YEAR IN GOSSIP  TAT THREE THERE'S A GERMAN WORD FOR THAT SO WHEN THEY THY WE LOST THIS PASTURIS ON TIN BIG SOME THE REAL TOOK FOR GRANTET I THINK SOMETHING KIND OF FRIGHTENING IN ITS IMPLICATIONS AND THAT'STHE IDEA THAT WE COULD COME OUT OF NATIONAL ELECTION AND AGREE THAT IT WAS LEGET AND AGREE ON WHO ONE HE RITHER ON ONE SIDE OF THIS OR THE OTHER EITHER YOU THINK THE MAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE TO DAY WON THE ELECTION FAIR AND SQUARE AR YOU DON'T TO STATID O CLEARLY AND UNAMBIGUOUSLY I AND THE PRODUCERS OF THIS RIDIOR PROGRAM SIDE WITH ALL THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO DO NOT THINK THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN IN GOUDING APPARENTLY NOW FORMER SENTAT MAJORITY WUT ERE MIH MC CONELL WHO SAID THE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE OTHERWISE WERE FED LIES BUT RIGHT NOW MILLIONS OF PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT WRONG GUI IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE A THIRD OF ALL VOTERS BELIEVE THRE WAS WIDESPREAD FRAUD WHICH IS REMARKABLE RIGHT BACK ON NOMEMBER GERNALIST IN GERMANY YOULL AND BIDDNER WAS WATCHING TIS UNFOLD SEEING THE FATE EVIDENCETHAT WAS SHOWING UP UNDER THE HASH TAG STOPPD THE STEEL READING THE PRESIDENT TWEETS ABOUT SUPPOSED ELECTION FRAUD AND FOR SOME REASON WHAT WHAT'S FRANK TO MY MIND WAS THAN THE MEMORY ELSE I THE TOY SHOLL S AGAINALL THE STEP IN THE BECK MIT THE STAB IN THE BACKMITH THAT A LEAN ABOUT IN SCHOOL MORE LESS EVERY GERMAN WOULD NOW THE STEP IN THE BECNISS BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A POTENTS O WY THEGERMAN HISTORY STOP THE STEEL IS ABOUT LOSING AN ELECTION THE STAB IN THE BACKMITH IS ABOUT LOSING AN ENTIRE WAR NAMELY WORD WORE ONE BUT THEIR PARALELS BETWEE THE TWO EYES AND THE WAY THEY TOOK HOLD HENREIN SETTLING TE HI STRY OUT GOES LIKE THIS SPASICALLY HERE CAME A POINT IN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN THE UNITED STATES HAD ENTERED THE WAR GERMAN SUFFERED DEFEATS IS CURED TO EVERYBODY THE GERMAN HE WAS GOING TO LOSE HE FACT NAVY SAILORS REFUSED TO HEAD OUT TO BE KILLED ON WHAT THEY SAW IS SUICIDE MISSIONS IN A WORD THAT WAS DOOMED WITHIN GERMANY LODES OFTHE POPULATION WAS AGAINST IT AND SO IN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN THE GERMAN SURRENDERED GERMAN EMPEROR CISOR WILHAM THE SECOND ABDICATED THE THRON FLED THE COUNTRY GERMANY BECAME A DEMOCRACY FOR THE FIRST TIME BUT RIGHT A WAY STARTING IN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN INCIDENTALLY ALSO AT GOBEPANDEMAC GOING ON RIGHT THEN THE NINETEEN EIGHTEEN FLE FIFTY MILLION DIED RIGHT THEN STARTING IN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN RIGHT WING POLITICIANS AND NEWSPAPERS STARTED PUSHING THIS LIE THE CAND OF STATY ANGRY GRUMBEAT OF COVERAGE SEIG THAT IN FACT THE COULD HAVE WON THE WAR IF GEWS AND SOCIAL DEMOCRATS AND LEFT US ADN STABE THE COUNTRY IN THE BACK BY FORCING GERMANY TO SURRENDER BOU THE CREATERS LOFF WE STEPON THE BECKNESS NEW THAT THEY WERE LYING OLL THE LECSES O THE LODEND OFF A WOE LEKE US UPPORTED THE NASSIES TTHEY KNEW WELL THAT A THE WOLLAS LOST WAS E LOST CAUSE SO AFTER THE SMITH BEGINS ONE OF THO THINKS THAT YOU RIGHT IS THAT THERE WAS NO NATIONAL CONSENSES ONLY REALITY YES ON WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THIS AND IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE FOR A DEMOCRACY TO CONTINUE YES AN THAT WAS QUITE TRUE AND THEAR TE DISTURBING EFFECT OF THE STEP IN THE BECKMIS WAS THAT IT DID NOT GROW WEAKER BUT STRONGER OWER THE EAS AND YOU MIGHT HAVE EXPECTET AN THAT EVENTUALLIEE PEOPLE WILL SEE THE TRUS AM THEY WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THE FECTS THEY WILL BELIEVE WITH GERNALISTS AND SERVES AND HISTORIANS TELL THEM BUT AND THE CONTRARY IS TRUE TIS I GAN ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT I TOOK FROM ANOBED THAT YORAND WROTE ABOUT ALL THIS BACK IN NOVEMBER IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT ALI LIKE THIS MIGHT NOT DIE OFF ON ITS OWN I VERY WELL MIGHT STICK AROUND AND GROWIN POWER THROUGHOUT THE MACHIN TWENTIES THE IDEA THAT CERTAIN GERMANS BUT TO BLAME FOR THES DEFEAT FOR THE BI LOSS WAS VERY SEDECTIV AND VERY ATRECTIS AND I WOULD GO SO FAR TO SAY THAT ITIT HAVEN'T BEEN FOR THE STEP IN THE BECKMITES AT THE NOSIES COULD HAVE NEVER BEEN AS SUCCESSFUL AS THEY WERE IT WAS A CENTRAL PREMISE IN HICGERS SPEECHES AND IDEOLOGY AN YOU BECLAR YOREN BINER IS DEEPLY AWARE OF THE DIFFRENCES BETWEEN AMERICA TO DAY AND GERMANY IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES HE IS NOT SAYING THAT WE SHOULD ACPECT THE RISE OF A NEW AHT OFF HICERER SOMETING LIKE THAT BUT HE IS SAYING HAT WHEN NINETEEN TWENTY'S GERMANY SHOWS US IS HOW EFFECTIVE AND POPULAR AND ALTERNATE REALITY CAN BE AN A COUNTRY THIS STEEPLY POLORIZE THE OTHER POINT ALONG HESE LINES THAT REALLY HAS STAYED WITH ME AND FEELS RELEVANT TO TO DAY IN AMERICA IS THAT BACK IN THE TWENTIES PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THIS MAT SO THER OPPONENTS IS TRAITERS IS PEOPLE WHO BETRAYD GERMANY IN THIS BASIC FUNDAMENT AWAY WHICH TIN JUSTIFIED ANYTHING THAT WAS DONE AGAINST THEM THA THE ACTUAL ACCUSATION AM WAS THAT ALL THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SO CALED STEP IN THE BACK WERL CRIMINALS AN NOVEMBER SABRECIA NOVEMBER CRIMINALS WHO SIN THE AMISTES IN NOVEMBER OT IN EIGHTEEN SO THE IDEA WAS THAT THEY WERE THE ONES WHO OBSTRUCTEDS THE LEGITIMATE COURSE OF HISTORY BUT WHEN YOU SAY THAT IT MAKES ME THINK ABOUT THE PROTESTERS AT THE CAPITAL WHO WHO FEEL LIKE THE ELECTIONS BEEN STOLEN LIKE OF COURSE EXTREME MEASURES SARE CALLED FOR AND ELECTIONS BEEN STOLEN FROM THEM THAT THIS IS AN INTERESTING MANSERD ISN'T IT I MEAN WE KNOW IT FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE SO CONVINCE OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THEIR CALS THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT EVEN VIOLENCE IS LEGITIMATES TO THECHIEVE THEIR GAMES IT IS MORE OR LESS A TERRORIS MONSER OR EXTRAMISTS MONS OF COURSE THEY FEEL THAT THEY ARE THE EXTUAL DEFENDERS OF THE TRUE AMERICA E I I RETTHAT AN REPUBLICANS WHICH HE SPOKE OUT AGAINST TRUMP AND AGAINST THE OF THE STEEL COMPAN THEY KNOW HAS TO FEARFOR THEIR LIVES I SAW THAT TO THE DEAT THREATS AGAINS REPUBLICANS WHOVOTED TO ACCEPT THE ELECTION RESULTS A BACK IN THE TWENTIES IN GERMANY THER WAS VIOLENCE STARTING WITH THE GERMAN POLITICIAN WHO NEGOTIATED THEIR TERMS OF SURRENDER AND WERE T WERE WON HE WAS MURDERED A MAN NAMED A TIOUS ERITZBURGER ONE OF HIS ASSASSINS FROM A FIRST VAILED ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON ON TRIAL UNTIL THE JUDGE THEY DID IT CAS ERCZBURGERS STABED THE COUNTRY IN THE BACK IN THE JUDGESTON WHERE HE GOT THIS IDEA HE SAID THE NEWSPAPERS SO YM PRESEN BINDS AN OFFICE ESIGN EXECUTIVE ORDERS IN TALKING ABOUT UNITY AND TRYING TO TURN THE PAGE BUT ALI THIS BIG E DIDN'T LOSE A WAR YE DIN'T LOSE AN ELECTION ON SIC GROUND INFESTOR AND GROW IF CN WE TO BE BELOSING FAITH IN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT FACT GERMANY STOPED BEING A DEMO CRACY BY THE THIRTIES AND CAN WE DO VIOLENCE BTHAT FOR FARN TWINING SO

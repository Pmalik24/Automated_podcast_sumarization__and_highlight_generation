WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAPONCETAF SCIENCE SCIENCSPACE TO S  IN I MANDERHUBERMEN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF INTRODUCING THE FIRST GUEST OF THE HUBERMAN LAD PODCAST MY GUEST IS DOCTOR CARL DYCEROTH DOCTOR CARL DYCEROTH IS A MEDICAL DOCTOR IS A PSYCHIATRIST AND A RESEARCH SCIENTIST AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE IN HIS CLINICAL PRACTICE HE SEES PATIENTS DEALING WITH HE RANGE OF NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS INCLUDING OBSESSIVE COMPULSO DISORDER AUTISM ATTENTION DEFISITE DISORDERS SKETSOPHRANIA MANIA ANXIETY DISORDERS AND EATING DISORDERS HIS LABORATORY DEVELOPSAN EXPLORES TOOLS WITH WHICH TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WORKS IN THE HEALTHY SITUATION AS WELL AS IN DISORDERS OF THE MIND DOCTOR DYCEROS LABORATORY HAS PIONEER THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF WHAT ARE CALLED CHANNEL OPSINS PROTENES THAT COME FROM ALOGY WHICH CAN NOW BE INTRODUCED TO THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS OF ANIMALS AND HUMANS IN ORDER TO PRECISELY CONTROL THE ACTIVITY OF NERONS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY WITH THE USE OF LIGHT THIS IS A ABSOLUTELY TRANSFORMATIVE TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE WHEREAS CERTAIN DRUG TREATMENTS CAN OFTEN RELIEVE CERTAIN SYMPTEMS OF DISORDERS THEY OFTEN CARRY VARIOUS SIDE EFFECTS AND IN SOME INDIVIDUALS OFTEN MANY INDIVIDUALS THESE DRUG TREATMENT SIMPLY DO NOT WORK THE CHANNEL OBSENS AND THE RELATED TECHNOLOGIES STAND TO TRANSFORM THE WAY THAT WE TREAT PSYCHIATRIC ILLNESS AND VARIOUS DISORDERS OF MOVEMENT AND PERCEPTION IN FACT JUST RECENTLY THE CHANNEL OSENS WERE APPLIED IN A HUMAN PATIENT TO ALLOW AN ADULT FULLY BLIND HUMAN BEING TO SEE LIGHT FOR THE VERY FIRST TIND WE ALSO DISCUSS DOCTOR DYCERO'S NEWLY RELEASED BOOK WHICH IS ENTITLE PROJECTIONS A STORY OF HUMAN EMOTIONS THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY REMARKABLE BOOK THAT USES STORIES ABOUT HIS INTERACTIONS WITH HIS PATIENTS TO TEACH YOU HOW THE BRAIN WORKS IN THE HEALTHY AND DISEASED STATE AND ALSO REVEALS THE MOTIVATION FOR AND DISCOVERY OF THESE CHANNEL OPSENCS IN OTHER TECHNOLOGIES BY CARL'S LABORATORY THAT ARE BEING USED NOW TO TREAT VARIOUS DISORDERS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THAT IN THE FUTURE ARE CERTAIN TO TRANSFORM THE FIELDS OF PSYCHIATRY MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTH IN GENERAL I FOUND OUR CONVERSATION TO BE AN ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING ONE ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN FUNCTIONS IN THE HEALTHY STATE AND WHY AND HOW IT BREAKS DOWN IN DISORDERS OF THE MIND WE ALSO DISCUSS THE CURRENT STATUS AND FUTURE OF PSYCHODELIC TREATMENTS FOR PSYCHIATRIC ILLNESS AS WELL AS FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW THE BRAIN WORKS MORE GENERALLY WE ALSO DISCUSS ISSUES OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND WE EVEN DELVINTO HOW SOMEBODY LIKE CARL WHOSE MANAGING A FULLTIME CLINICAL PRACTISE AND A FORTY PLUSPERSON LABORATORY AND A FAMILY OF FIVE CHILDREN AND IS HAPPILY MARRIED HOW HE ORGANIZES IS INTERNAL LANDSCAPE HIS OWN THINKING IN ORDER TO MANAGE THAT IMMENSE WORK LOAD AND TO P ROGRESS FORWARD FOR THE SAKE OF MEDICINE AND HIS PURSUITS IN SCIENCE I'VE FOUND THIS TO BE AN INCREDIBLE CONVERSATION I LEARN SO MUCH I ALSO LEARNED THROUGH THE COURSE OF READING CARL'S BOOK PROJECTIONS THAT NOT ONLY IS HE IN A COMPRIS PSYCHIATRIST AND OBVIOUSLY A TH COMPRISH RESEARC SCIENTIST AND A FAMILY MAN BUT HE'S ALSO A PHEKNOMINAL WRITER PROJECTIONS IS ABSOLUTELY MASTERFULLY WRITTEN IS JUST BEAUTIFUL AND ITS ACCESSIBLE TO ANYBODY EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SCIENCE BACKGROUND SO I HOPE THAT YOU'LL ENJOY MY CONVERSATION WITH CARLDISRATH AS MUCH AS I DID AND THANK YOU FOR TUNING IN BEFORE WE BEGIN I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IN MY DESIRE AN EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS THLETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE SOM DELITED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AN THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT T HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GUP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS IT GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED END THE PROBIICS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRIATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THE'LL GIVE YOU FI FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TOO THREARE TON OF DATAND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENSIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF FO'RE GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIEN INVITEEM IN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CAREVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREENSTOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIFREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOS OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR I'VE TALKE MANY TIMES BEFORE IN THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION END ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AN ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPERATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IHYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMON SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH EL LEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE PROPARATIA AS OF ELECTROLIGHT IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY

TO ELEMENT ELEMENT Y DOCALM A SLASH HUBERMET AND NOW MY CONVERSATION WITH DOCTOR CARL DYCEER OFF THANKS FOR BEING HERE THANKS FOR HEAVING IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING FOR ME A BECAUSE A YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS BUT ONE O THER REASONS I STARTED THIS POD CAST WAS ACTUALLY SO I COULD HAVE THIS CONVERSATION IT'S IT'S BUT ONE THERE ARE OTHER REASONS BUT ONE OF THE GOALLS IS TO BE ABLE TO HOLD CONVERSATIONS WIH COLLEAGUES OF MINE THAT ARE DOING INCREDIBLE WORK IN THE REALM OF SCIENCE AND THEN HERE WE ALL SHAVE THIS REALLY SPECIAL OPPORTUNITY BECAUE YOUARE ALSO A CLINITION YOU SEE PATIENT AND HAVE FOR A LONG TIME SO FOR PEOPLE THAT MIGHT NOT BE SO FAMILIAR WITH THE FIELDS OF NARO SCIENCE ET CETERA WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NEROLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY BUT IT IS  I'M I'M MARRIED TONEROLOGIST AND I AM A PSYCHITRIST AND WE MAKE FUN OF EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME OA THIS IS A LOT OF NER SCIENTISTS AND A LOT OF BRAIN CLINISSIONS ACTUALLY THINK THESE TO SHOULD BE THE SAME FIELD AT AT' SOME POINTS IN THE FUTURE THEY WERE IN THE PAST THEY STARTED TOGETHER PSYCHIATRY THOUGH A FOCUS IS ON DISORDERS WHERE WE CAN'T SEE SOMETHING THAT'S PHYSICALLY WRONG WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A MEASURABLE THERE'S NO BLOOD TEST THAT MAKES THE DIAGNOSIS THERE'S NO BRAIN SCAN THAT TELLS US THIS IS KETS OF FRIEND THIS IS DEPRESSION FOR AGN INDIVIDUAL PATIENT I SO PSYCHATRY IS IS MUCH MORE MYSTERIOUS AND THE ONLY TOOLS WE HAVE ARE WORDS NEUROLOGIS ARE FANTASTIC PHYSICIANS THEY SEE THE STROKE ON BRAIN SCANS THEY SEE THE SEIZURE AND THE PRESEIZURE ACTIVITY WITH AN G A AND THEY CAN MEASURE AND TREAT BASED ON THOSE MEASURABLES IN PSYCHIATRY WE HAVE A HARDER JOB I THINK WE USE WORDS WE HAVE RAITING SCALES FOR SYMPTOMS WE CAN MEASURE DEPRESSIONN AN AUTISM WITH RATING SCALES BUT THOSE ARE WORDS STILL AND ULTIMATELY THAT'S WHAT PSYCHITRY'S BUILT AROUND IT'S IT'S AN ODD SITUATION BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THE MOST COMPLEX BEAUTIFUL MYSTERIOUS INCREDIBLY ENGINEERED AOBJECT IN THE UNIVERSE AND YET ALL WE HAVE ARE WORDS TO FIND OUR WAY AND SO DO YOU FIND THAT IF A PATIENT IS VERY VERBAL OR HYPER VERBAL  YOU HAVE AN EASIER TIME DIAGNOSING THEM AS SUPPOSE TO SOMEBODY WHO'S A MORE QUIET AND RESERVED WORS I COUN IMAGINE THE OPPOSITE MIGHT BE TRUE AS WELL BUT IT BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE WORDS YOU PUT YOUR FINGER ON A KEY POINT IF THEY DON'T SPEEK THAT MUCH IN PRINCIPLE IT'S HARDER THE LACK OF SPEECH CAN BE SYMPTOM WE CAN SEE THAT IN DEPRESSION WE CAN SEE THAT AND NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS OF SCUIZAPHRANIA WE CAN SEE THAT IN AUTISM SOMETIMES BY ITSELF THAT IS A SYMPTOM AA REDUCED SPEECH BUT ULTIMATELY DO NEED SOMETHING YOU NEED A SOME SOME WORDS TO HELP GUIDE YOU AND THAT IN FACT IN THERE'S THERE'S TE CHALLENGES THAT I I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT WHERE PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION WHO ARE SO DEPRESSED THEY CAN'T SPEAK THAT MAKES IT A BIT OF CHALLENGE TO DISTINGUISHED DEPRESSION FROM SOME OF THE OTHER REASONS THEY MIGHT NOT BE SPEAKING AND THIS IS A ASORT OF ART AND THE SCIENCE OF PSYCHIATRY DON DO YOU FIND THAT THERE ARE A PATIENTS THAT HAVE BUT LET'S CALL THEM CA MORBIDITIES OR CONDITIONS WHERE THEY WOULD LAND IN BOTH PSYCHIETRY AND NEUROLOGY MEANING A THERE'S DAMAGE TOA PATICULARITY OF THE BRAIN AND THEREFORE THEIR DEPRESSED AND HOW DO YOU TEASE THAT OUT AS A PSYCHIATRIST THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME A PARKINSON'S DISEASEAS A GREAT EXAMPLE A IT'S A IT'S A IT CAN BE DEBILITATING IN SO MANY WAYS A PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLE MOVING THE TROUBLE WALKING  TROUBLE SMALLOWING AND THEY CAN HAVE A TRULY SEVERE DEPRESSION A AND THIS IS YOU MIGHT SAY OH WELL THEY'VE GOT A LIFE THREATENING A ILLNESS BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS WHERE DEPRESSION IS NOT ASTRONG A STRONGLY COMB MORBID A SYMPTM A LIKE ALESS LUGARIS DISEASE FOR EXAMPLE DEPRESSION IS NOT A ASTRONG  A STRONGLY COME MORBID IN THAT DISEASE BUT IN PARKINSONS IT IS EXTREMELY COMMON AND AS YOU KNOW AND IN PARKNSON'S DISEASE WE HAVE LOSS OF THE DOPOMIN ERONS IN IN THE IN THE MID BRAIN AND THIS IS A VERY A A SPECIFIC POPULATION OF CELLS THAT'S DYING AND PROBABLY THAT LEADS TO BOTH THE MOVEMENT DISORDER AND THE DEPRESSION THERE MANY EXAMPLES OF THAT WHERE THESE TWO FIELDS COME TOGETHER AND YOU REALLY NEEDS WORK AS A TEEM I'VE HAD PATIENTS IN MY CLINIC THAT I I TREAT THE DEPRESSION ASSOCIATE WITH THEIR PARKINSONS AND A NEUROLOGIST TREATS THE MOVEMENT ASSOCIET WITH THE PARKINSONS AND TE WORK TOGETHER DO YOU THINK WIU WILL EVER HAVE A BLOOD TEST FOR DEPRESSION IN NERSE GETS OF FRENAR AUTISM AND WOULD THAT BE A GOOD WERE A BAD THING I THINK AULTIMATELY THERE WILL BE QUANTITATIVE TESTS A ALREADY EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO LOOK AT CERTAIN RHYTHMS IN THE BRAIN USING EXTERNAL EEGS AD TO LOOK AT BRAINWAVES EFFECTIVELY LOOK AT THE RATIOS OF CERTAIN FREQUENCIES TO OTHER FREQUENCIES AND THERE'S SOME PROGRESS BEING MADE ON THAT FRONT A IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS AT  COULD BE IT DOESN'T REALLY GIVE YOU THE CONFIDENCE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL PATIENT THAT YOU WOULD YOU WOULD LIKE BUT ULTIMATELY WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE BRAIN IN PSYCATRIC DISEASE IS PHYSICAL A AND IT'S DUE TO THE CIRCUITS AND THE CONNECTIONS IN THE PROJECTIONS IN THE BRAIN THAT ARE A NOT WORKING AS THEY WOULD IN A A TYPICAL SITUATION AND I I DO THINK WILL HAVE THOSE MEASURAPBLES AT SOME POINT NOW IS THA GOOD OR BAD I YOU KNOITE I THINK THAT WILL BE GOOD ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE WITH A PSYCHIETRY IS IT IS AN ART AS WELL AS A SCIENCE TO ELICIT THESE A SYMPTOMS I IN A PRECISEWAY DOES TAKE SOME TIME AND IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE COULD JUST TO A QUICK MEASUREMENT A COULD IT BE ABUSED OR OR OR MISUSED A CERTAINLY BUT THAT'S I THINK TRUE FOR ALL OF METICIN I WANT TO KNOW AND I'M SURE THERE ARE SEVERAL BUT WHAT DO YOU SEE IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FACING PSYCHIATRY AND THE TREATMENT OF MENTAL ILLNESS TO DAY I THINK WE HAVE A WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS ON WHAT THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WHICH I THINK THERE'S STILL SUCH A STRONG STIGNA FOR PSYCHATRIC DISEASE THAT A PATIENCE OFTEN DON'T COME TO US A AND I THEY FEEL THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE US ON THEIR OWN AND THACK TAC CAN SLOW TREATMENT IT CAN LEAD TO YUNA WORSENING SYMPTOMS WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE PATIENCE YO HAVE A UNTREATED ANXIETY ASSUES IF YOU GO FOR A YEAR OR MORE WITH A A SERIOUS UNTREATED ANXIETY ASUE THAT CAN CONVERT TO DEPRESSION YOU CAN ADD ANOTHER A PROBLEM ON TOP OF THE ANXIETY AND SO IT WOULD BE YOU KNOW WHY DO PEOPLE NOT COME FOR TREATMENT THEY THEY THEY FEEL LIKE THAS IS SOMETHING THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO MASTER ON THEIR OWN A WHICH WHICH CAN BE TRUE BUT A USUALLY AA SOMEHOLP IS IS IS A GOOD THING THAT RAISES IT A QUESTION RELATE TO SOMETHING I HEARD YOU SAY MANY YEARS AGO AT A LECTURE WHICH WAS THAT ON THIS WAS A SCIENTIFIC LECTURE N YOU SAID YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW HOW OTHER PEOPLE FEEL MOST THE TIME WE DON'T EVEN REALLY KNOW HOW WE FEEL MAY YE COULD ELABORATE ON THAT A LITTLE BUT AND THET THE ON DERTH OF OF WAISE THAT WE WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT FEELINGS IMEAN THERE SO MANY WORDS I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY BUT I'M GUESSING THERE MORE THAN A DOZEN WORDS TO DESCRIBE THE STATE THAT I CALL SADNESS BUT AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND WE DON'T HAVE ANY WAY OF COMPARING THAT IN IT AND REAL OBJECTIVE SENSE SO HOW AS A PSYCHITRIS WHEN YOUR JOB IS TO USE WORDS TO DIAGNOSE WORDS OF THE PATIENT O DIAGNOS DYOU MANEUVERE ROUND THAT AND AND WHAT IS THIS LANDSCAPE THAT WE CALL FEELINGS FOM EMOTIONS THIS IS A REALLY INTERESTING I PEOPLE HERE WE HAVE A THEIRS ATTENTION BETWEEN THE WORDS THAT WE'VE BUILT UP IN THE CLINIC THAT MEAN SOMETHING TO THE TO THE PHYSICIANS AND THEN THERE'S THE CCLOCAL USE OF WORDS THAT MAY NOT BE THE SAME AND SO THAT'S THE FIRST LEVEL WE HAVE TO START OUT WHEN SOME ONE SAYS YOU KNOW I'M I'M DEPRESSED A WHAT EXACTLY DO THEY MEAN BY THAT I THAT MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM FROM WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF DEPRESSION SO PART OF PSYCHIATRIES TO GET BEYOND THAT WORD AND TO GET INTO HOW THER ACTUALLY FEELING GET GET RID OF THE THE JARGON AND GET TO REAL WORLD EXAMPLES OF OF HOW THEIR FEELING SO YOU KNON'T HOW DO YOU WHAT HOW MUCH DO YOU LOOK FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE HOW MUCH A HOPED YOU HAVE HOW MUCH PLANNING ARE YOU DOING FOR THI FUTURE SO THESE HERE A NOG YOU'RE GETTING INTO ACTUAL THINGS YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THAT R UNAMBIGUOUS SOME ONE SAYS I I CAN'T EVEN I CAN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT TO MORROW I IM NOT I DON'T SEE HOW I'M GOIN TO GET TO TO MORROW THAT THAT'S A NICE PRECISE THING THAT YIT'S AT'S SAD AS TRAGIC BUT BUT IT'S ALSO THAT MEANS SOMETHING AND WE KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS THAT'S THE HOPELESSNESS SYMTEM OF DEPRESSION AND AND THAT IS WHAT I TRY TO DO WHEN I JOA SY CAT GAN IF YOU I TRY TO GET PAST THE JARGON AND GET TO WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN THE PATIENTS LIFE AND IN IN E MIND BUT AS YOU SAY ULTIMATELY YOUNOWTES SHOWS UP ACROSS I I I ADDRESS THE ISSURE EVERY DAY IN LIFE WHETHER ITS IN THE LAB WHEREER WERE LOOKING AT ANIMALS WHETHER FISH OR MICE A RATS AND STUDYING THERE BEHAVIOUR OR WHENN AN A CONVERSATION WITH JUST A A FRIEND OR A COLLEAGUE OR I'M TALKING TO PATIEN I NEVER REALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE THE MIND OF THE OTHER PERSON I GET I GET SOME FEE BACK I GET WORDS I GET BEHAVIOURS I GET ACTIENTS BUT I NEVER RLY NOW AND AS YOU SAID AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE QUESTION YOU KNOW OFTEN WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THE WORDS AND THE INSIGHT EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR OWN MIND I TINK A LOT OF PSYCCITRIS ARE PRETTY INTERESPECTIVE A THAT'S PAR OF THE REASON THEY AND UP IN THASPECIALTY INSO I MAYBE WE SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITHIN BUT IT DOESN'T MAN WE HAVE ANSWERS SO IN OM THIS A AREA OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON UNDER THE HOOD THROUGH WORDS SOUNDS I CERTAIN WORDS I WOULD RELATE TO THIS A THIS IDEA OF ANTICIPATION AND HOPE IM IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THAT SOMEHOW RELATES TO THE DOPLE MEAN SYSTEM AN THE SENSE THAT DOPAMEAN IS INVOLVED IN MOTIVATED BEHAVIORS I MEAN IS THAT IN IF I SAY FOR INSTANCE AND I I WON'T ASK YOU TO RUN A SESSION WITH ME HERE  ARFREE A TO THAT I CI GET RI A IF I WERE TO SAY YOU KNOW I I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE THE TO MORROW I JUST ITS I I JUST CAN'T DO IT SO THAT'S THAT'S NOT ACTION BASE THAT'S PURELY BASED ON MY MY INTERNAL NARRATIVE IM BUT I COULD IMAGINE THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW I I HAVE A TERRIBLE TIME SLEEPING I'M NOT HUNGRY I'M NOT EATING SO STATEMENTS ABOUT PHYSICAL ACTIONS I'M GUESSING ALSO HAVE OM VALIDITY THAT'SO AND THERE ARE NOWAYS TO MEASURE THE ACCURACY OF THOSE STATEMENTS LIKE FOR INSTANCE IF I GAVE YOU PERMISSION YOU COULD KNOW IF I SLEPT LAST NIGH OR WHETHER NOT I WAS JUST SAYING I HAD A POOR NIGHT SLEEPA NI  SO IN MOVING FORWARD THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND IN THE NEXT TEN AND HUNDRED YEARS OF PSYCHIETRY DO YOU THINK THAT THE BODY REPORTING SOME OF THE ACTIONS OF A HUMAN I' ARE GOING TO BECOME USEFUL AND AND MET MASH WITH THE WORDS IN A WAY THAT'S CAN TO MAKE YOUR JOB EASE EAR I DO THINK THAT'S TUE ANEES THE TWO THINGS YOU'VE MENTIONED EATING AND SLEEPING THOSE ARE ADDITIONAL A A CRITERIA THAT WE USE TO DIAGNOS DEPRESSION THES ARE THE VEGETATIVE SINES WE CALL THEM OF DEPRESSION POOR SLEEP IN POOR EATING AND IF YOU HAVE A BASE LINE FOR SOMEBODY THAT'S THE REAL CHALLENGE SO WHAT'S DIFFERENT IN THAT PERSON SOME PEOPLE WOULD DEPRESS THEY SLEEP MORE SOME PEOPLE WOUTD WHO ARE DEPRESS THEY SLEEP LESS SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE DEPRESSED THEIR MORE PHYSICALLY AGITATED AND A MOVE AROUND MORE SOME PEOPLE WHO ARD TOPRESS THEY THEY MOVE LESS EVEN ALL THEIR LY AND SO YOU NEED HERE'S THE CHALLENGE S YU CAN' JUST LOOK AT HOW THEY ARE NOW YOU HAVE TO GET A A BASE LINE O AND THEN SEE HOW IT'S CHANGED AND THAT CAN BE A CHALLENGE THAT RAISES YOU  ETHICAL ISSIES A  HOW DO YOU HOW TYOU COLLECT THAT BASE LINE INFORMATION FROM SOME ONE HEALTHY I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE SOLVED OF COURSE YOUO WITH PHONES AND EXHOLEROMETERS AND PONES A YOU COULD IN PRINCIPL COLLECT A LOT OF BASE LINE INFORMATION FROM PEOPLE BUT THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE A TREATED VERY A CAREFULLY HAVE FOR PRIVACY  REASONS AND IN TERMS OF MEASURING ONE'S OWN BEHAVIOUR YOU KNOW I I'VE HEARD OF WORK THAT'S GOING ON AMSAM GOLDEN UP IN THE IVERSEYO WASHINGTON E WHO WORKS ON A GRESSION IN ANIMAL MODELS WITH TELLING ME THAT THER'S SOME EFFORT THAT HE'S MAKING AND PERHAPS Y YOURE INVOLVED IN THIS WORK AS WELL I DON'T KNOW OF M DEVICES THAT WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE TO DETECT FOR INSTANCE WHEN THEIR VEERING TOWARDS A DEPRESSIVE EPISODE FOR THEMSELVES THAT THEY MAY CHOOSE WERE NOT CHOOSE TO REPORT THAT TO THEIR CLONATION MAYBE THEY DON'T EVEN HAWE A CLINITION MAYBE THIS PERSON THAT YOU REFERRED TO IT T BEGINNING O THIS PERSON WHO DOESN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE COMING TO TALK TO YOU THEY OM MAYBE SOMETHING IS MEASURING CHANGES IN THE INFLECTION OF THEIR VOICE WHERE THE THE SPEED AT WHICH THEY GET UP FROM A CHAIR DO YOU THINK THAT THOSE KIND OF METRICS WILL EVENTUALLY INFORM SOMEBODY HAY IN NA YEAR IN TROUBLE THIS IS GETTING TO THIS QUESTION OF ABACK TO THE STATEMENT THAT I HEARD YOU MAKE AND WRUNG IN MY MIND NOW I THINK FOR MORE THAN A DECADE WHICH IS OFTENTIMES WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW WE FEEL YOUKNOW THAT THAT I DO LIKE BECAUSE THAT GIVES THE PATIENT THE AGENCY TO TO DETECT WHAT'S GOING ON AND EVEN SEPARATE FROM MODERN TYCHNOLOGY THIS HAS BEEN PART OF THE THEY ART OF PSYCHIETRY IS TO HELP PATIENTS REALIZE THAT SOMETIMES OTHER PEOPLE OBSERVING THEM CAN GIVE THEM THE EARLIEST MORNING SIGNS OF DEPRESSION WE SEE THIS VERY OFTEN IN IN IN FAMILY THOUGH THEY'LL NOTICE WHEN THE PATIENT IS CHANGING BEFORE THE PATIENT DOES AND THEN THERE ARE THINGS THE PATIENT THEY NOTICE BUT NOT CORRECTLY ASCRIBED TOO THE ON SET OF DEPRESSION AND A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF THAT IS WHAT WE CALL EARLY MORNING AWAKENING AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN HAPPEN VERY EARLY AS PEOPLE START TO SLIDE INTO DEPRESSION THEY START TO WAKE UP EARLIER AN EARLIER YOU KNOWJUST INEXPLICABLY THEYR WAKE AS IS LIKE TWO A M THREE A M YE WAKEN THEY COULD START YET COULD START AT FIV M COULD GO FOR AN UNARING TO FALL BACK TO SLEEP UNABLE FALL BACK TO SLEEP EXACTLY H SO THAT'S AND THAT THEY MAY NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITHAT I COULD JUST BE FOM THEIR PROSPECTIVES JUST SOMETHING HATS HAPPENING BUT IF YOU PUT ENOUGH OF THAT INFORMATION TOGETHER HAT THAT COULD BE A USEFUL WORNING SIGN FOR THE PATIENT AN I CAN HELP THEM SEEK TREATMENT AND I THINK THAT IS A SOMETHING THAT COULD BE REALLY VALUABLE INTERESTING SO IN THIS FRAMEWORK OF YOU NOT NEEDING WORDS TO SELF REPORT OR MACHINES TO DETECT HOW WE FEEL OR AND MAY BE IN FORM OF A PSYCHIATRIST A HOW  PATIENT FEELS WONT A A TOUCH ON SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT YOU BEN INVOLVED IN BUILDING BUT AS A WAIGT OF MARCH IN TO THAT  ARE THERE ANY VERY GOOD TREATMENTS FOR PSYCHEATRIC DISEASE MEANING ARE THERE CURRENTLY ANY PILLS POTIONS FORMS OF COMMUNICATION THAT RELIABLY WORK EVERY TIME WEAS WORK IN MOST PATIENCE AND COULD YOU GIVE A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF GREAT SUCCESSES OF PSYCHIATRY IF THEY EXIST US YO WE ARE FORTUNATE IN THIS COMING PACK TO MY A YOU KNOW A THE JOKING O BETWEEN MY WIFE AND MYSELF IN TERMS A NEUROLOGY AND PSYCHAETRY WE ACTUALLY IN PSYCHIETRY DESPITE THE DEPTHS OF OUR THE MYSTERY WE STRUGGLE WITH MANY OF OUR TREATMENTS ARE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW WORK WORK WE MAY BE DOING BETTER THAN SOME OTHER SPECIALTIES AND TERMS AN ACTUALLY CAUSING YO THEIRPUD BENEFECT FOR PATIENTS WE DO HELP PATIENTS YOU KOW THE PATIENTS WHO SUFFER FROM ATBY THE WAY BOTH MEDICATIONS AND TALK THERAPY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE TAN MANY CASES A FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE WITH PANIC DISORDER COGNIC BEHAVIRAL THERAPY JUST WORKING WITH WORDS HELPING PEOPLE IDENTIFY THE EARLY SIGNS WHEN THEIR STARTING TON TOR A PANIC ATTACK WHAT ARE THE COGNITIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING YOU CAN TRAIN PEOPLE TO DERAIL THAT AND AND YOU CAN VERY POTENTLY TREAT PANIC DISORT OF THAT WAY HOLLONGED IS SOMETHING LIKE THAT TAKE FOR ON AVERAGE FOR MOTIVATED IN PSYHTFUL PATIENT YOU CAN HAVE A A VERY A YOUNA COOK BOOKY SERIES OF PSESSIONS AND A SIX TO TWELVE SESSIONS OR OR EVEN LESS FOR SOMEONE IS VERY A INSIYGHTFUL AND MOTIVATED I IT CAN HAVE A VERY POWERFUL EFFECT TECT QUICKLY A AND THAT'S JUST WITH WORDS THERE ARE MANY PSYCHATRIC MEDICATIONS THAT ARE VERY EFFECTIVE FOR A THA CONNITIONS THAT THEIR TREATING A ANTYPSYCOTIC MEDICATIONS THEY HAVE SIDE EFFECTS BUT AOY DO THEY WORK THEY REALLY CAN CLEAR UP PARTICULARLY THE POSITIVE SYMPTOMS OF OF SKETS O FRANIA FOR EXAMPLE THE AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS THE PARENOISA PEOPLE'S LIVES CAN BE TURNED ROUND BY THESE A WE SHOULD CLARIFY POSITIVE SYMPTOMS YOU MEAN NOT POSITIVE IN THAT IN THE QUOLITATIVE SENSE YOU MEAN POSIVE MEANING THAT THE APPEARANCE OF OF SOMETHING ABNORMAL EXACTLY I THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATIONS WHEN WE SAY POSITIVE SYMPTOMS WE DO MEAN THE ADDITION OF SOMETHING THAT WASN'T THERE BEFOR LIKE A HALLUCINATIENT OR A PARONOISA AND THAT STANDS IN CONTRAST THE NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS WERE SOMETHING IS TAKEN AWAY AND TESE ARE PATIENTS WHO ARE WHO ARE WITHDRAWN THEY THEY HAVE A WHAT WE CALL THOUGHT LOCKING THEY CAN EVEN PROGRESS FOR IN A SEQUENCE OF THOUGHTS A BOTH OF THOSE CAN BE PART OF SKETS OF FRANIA THE THE HALLUCINATIONS IN THE PARONOISA ARE MORE EFFECTUAVELY TREATED RY NOW BUT THEY ARE EFFECTIVELY TREATED AND THEN YOU KNOW THIS IS A A FRUSTRATING AND YET HEARTENING ASPECT OF PSYCHIETRY THERE ARE TREATMENTS LIKE ELECTRO CONFULSE ELECTRIC CONVULSIVE THERAPY WHICH IS A WHERE YOU KNOW IT'S EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE FOR DEPRESSION WE HAVE PATIENTS WHO NOTHING ELSE WORKS FOR THEM WHERE THEY CAN'T TOLERATE MEDICATIONS AND A YOU CAN ADMINISTER UNDER VERY SAFE CONTROLLED A CONDITION WHERE THE PATIENTSBODY IS NOT MOVING THEIR PUT INTO VERY SAFE A SITUATION WHER THE BODY DOESN'T MOVE OR SEES IT'S JUST AN INTERNAL A PROCESS THAT'S TRIGGERED IN THE BRAIN THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY EFFECT OF TREATMENT FOR TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION AT THE SAME TIME I FIND IT AS AS AS HEARTENING AS IT IS TO SEE PATIENTS RESPOND TO THIS WITH WITH A A WHO HAVE SEVERE DEPRESSION I'M ALSO FRUSTRATED BY WHY WHY CAN'T WE DO SOMETHING MORE PRECISE THAN THAN THAS FOR THESE VERY SEVERE CASES AND PEOPLE O SOUGHT FOR DECADES TO UNDERSTAND HOW IS IT THATA SEIZURE IS LEADING TO THE RELIEF OF OF DEPRESSION AN WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER YET WE WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT PEOPLE ARE WORKING HARD ON THAT BUT THAT IS A TREATMENT THAT DOES WORK TO A ALL IN ALL THESE CASES THOUGH IN PSYCHIETRY TH THA THE FRUSTRATNG THING IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING THAT A CARDEOLOGIST HAS IN THINKING ABOUT THE HEART YOU KNOW THE HEART IS WE NOW KNOW IT'S A PUMP IT'S PUMPING BLOOD AND SO YOU CAN LOOK AT EVERYTHING ABOUT HOW IT'S WORKING ARE NOT WORKING IN TERMS OF THAT FRAME IT'S CLEARLY AT PUMP WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THAT LEVEL OF WHAT WHAT IS THE CIRCUIT REALLY THERE FOR IN PSYCHIETRY A AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT IS MISSING THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO FIND SO WE CAN DESIN TRULY EFFECTIVE AND SPECIFIC TREATMENTS TO WHAT YOU WHAT ARE THE PIECES THAT ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO CURATISM CURE PARKINS AN CURESKIS OF FRENIA I I WOULD IMAGINE THEIR SEVERAL BELEMENTS AND BINS HERE A UNDERSTANDING THAT THE NATURAL BIOLOGY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE ACTIVITY PATTERNS ARE HOW TO MODIFY THOSE MAYBE A YOU COULD JUST TELL US WHAT YOU THINK WHAT IS THE THE BENTO BOX OF THE PERFECT CURE I THINK THE FIRST THING WE NEED IS UNDERSTANDING WE NEED WE NEED AIS ALMOST EVERY PSYCHATIC TREATMENT HAS BEEN SARIN TIPITIS THE IDENTIFI JUST NOTING BY CHANCE THAT SOMETHING THAT WAS DONE FOR SOME PERSON ALSO HAD A SIDE EFFECT LIKE LITHIUMER PSYCLITHIAN AS IN AS A GOOD EXAMPLE IS IT TRUE THAT IT WAS THE THE URINE OF GUINEA PIGS GIVEN AYON THAT WAS GIVEN TO MANIC PATIENT THAT MADE THEM NOT MANIC IS THAT TRUE I DON'T HAVE FIRST ANDKNOWLEDGE OF THAT  THA I WOULD I WOULD DEFER THAT BUT IT'S IS TRUE FOR ESSENTIALLY EVERY TREATMENT YOU KOW THAT THE ANTIDOPRESSENCE ORIGINALLY A Y A AROS AS ANTI TOVIRCULOSIVE DRUGS FOR EXAMPLE LY NON AND SO THIS IS A IT'S A CLASSIC EXAMPLE FOR A A INNICENCES IS A CROSS ALL OF OF PSYCHIETRY A AND OF COURSE THIS DE SEIZURES AS WELL THAT WAS NOTICE THAT PATIENTS WHO HAD EPILEPSY THEY ARHAD A SEIZURE THEIR AND ALSO HAD DEPRESSION THAT THEY BECAME MUCH AT LEAST FOR A WHILE THEY WERE IMPROVED AFTER US EISURE THAT'S AMAZING I DN'T WANT TO GE OFF COURSE TO THE QUESTION THAT I ENSWERING THE QUESTION I ASKED BUT A I'VE HEARD BEFORE THAT IF OUGHT TO STIC CHILDREN GET A FEVER THAT THEIR SYMPTOMS IMPROVE IS THAT TRUE I'VE I'VE DONE A FAIR BIT OF OF WORK WITH OUTISM I IN MY CLENICAL PRACTISE I WORK WITH A DULL OUTISM AND I HAVE HEARD A STATEMENTS LIKE THAT AND INDESCRIPTIONTS LIKE THAT FROM FROM PATIENTS AND THEIR THEIR FAMILIES A IT'S A IT'S THAT IS VERY HARD TO STUDY QUANTITATIVELY BECAUSE OFTEN WITH A CHILDREN YOU HAVE THIS A A A NOT AS QUANTITATIVE AS YOU LIKE COLLECTION OF SYMPTOM INFORMATION OT FROM FROM FROM HOME BUT I HAVE HEARD THAT ENOUGH THAT I THINK THER THERE MAY WELL BE SOMETHING TO THAT AND YOU KNOW WHAT IS ANY TIME YOU HAVE A FEVER WHAT'S GOING ON WHELL WE KNOW ALL THE SELLS IN THE BRAIN AND I KNOW THIS AS AN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIST IF YOU JUST CHANGE THE TEMPERATURE BY A FEW DEGREES EVERYTHING CHANGES ABOUT OW NERON'S WORK AND THAT'S EVEN JUST A SINGLE NORON IT'S EVEN MORE LIKELY TO BE COMPLEX AND DIFFERENT WITH A CIRCUIT OF NURONS THAT ARE ALL AFFECTING EACH OTHER JUST ELEVATE THE TEMPERATURE LITTE BIT EVERYTHINGS DIFFERENT AND SO IT'S IT'S PLAUSIBLE FOR SORE THE THINGS LIKE THAT COULD HAPPEN AND DO HAPPEN NOW A BUT AND YET WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT OUTISM TO TAKE YOUR EXAMPLE YES WE SEE CHANGES BUT WHAT IS THE ELEMENT IN THE BRAIN THAT'S ANALOGOUS TO THE PUMPING HEART WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESTION THAT'S MAYBE YOU KNOW WE THINK ABOUT MOTIVATION AND DOPEN MENERONS WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OUTISM IT'S A LITTLE MORE CHALLENGING A YOU HAD THERE'S A A DEFICITE IN A SOCIAL INTERACTION AND INCOMMUNICATION AND SO WHERE IS THAT WHEREIS THE WHEREIS THAT SITUATED WHAT IS THE KEEP PRINCIPLE A GOVERNING THE SOCIAL INTERACTION A THIS IS BUT WHERE WE NEED THE BASIC SCIENCE TO BRING US A STEP FORWARD S WEINS EKE THIS IS THE PROCESS THAT'S GOING ON THIS IS WHAT'S NEEDED FOR THE INCREDIBLY COMPLEX TASK OF SOCIAL INTERACTION WHERE YOU'VE GOT INCREDIBLY RICH DATA STREAMS OF SOUND AND MEANING I CONTACT BODY MOVEMENT AND THAT'S JUST FOR ONE PERSON OAR IF THERE'S A GROUP OF PEOPLE THIS IS OVERWHELMING FOR PEOPLE WITH WITH OUTISM WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE UNIFYING THENE THARE IT'S A LOT OF INFORMATION AND AND THAT MAYBE IS UNMATCHED IN ANY REALM OF BIOLOGY THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION COMING IN THROUGH A SOCIAL INTERACTION PRETICTLY WITH WORDS  LANGUAGE AND SO THEN THAT TURNS OUR ATTENTION AS ANERS SCIENTISTS WE THINK OKE LET'S THINK ABOUT THE PARTS THE BRAIN THAT ARE INVOLVED AN DEALING WITH MERGING COMPLEX DATA STREMS THE VERY HIGH INBIT RATE THAT NEED TO BE FUSED TOGETHER INTO UNITARY CONCACT AND THAT STARTS TO GUIDE US AND MAYBE WE CAN AND WE KNOW OTHER ANIMALS ARE SOCIAL IN THEIR OWN WAY AND WE CAN STUDY THOSE ANIMALS AND SO THAT THERE'S THAT'S HOW I THINK ABOUT IT THERE'S HOPE FOR THE FUTURE THINKING ABOUT THE SYMPTOMS AS AN ENGINEER MIGHT AND TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE CIRCUITS THAT ARE LIKELY WORKING A TO MAKE THIS TYPICAL BEHAVIOR HAPPEN AND NOW WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW BECOMES A TYPICAL SO THAT SEEMS LIKE THE FIRST TO ME THE FIRST BEN OF THIS WHAT I CALL THE BENTO BOX A FOR LACK OF A A A BETTER ANALOGY THAT WE NEED TO KNOW THE CIRCUITS WE NEEDED NOT THE CELLS IN THE VARIOUS BRAIN REGIONS AND AND PORTIONS OF THE BODY AND A AND HOW THEY CONNECT TO ONE ANOTHER AND WHAT THE PATTERNS OF ACTIVITY ARE UNDER A NORMAL COTINCORT HEALTHY INTERACTION IF WE UNDERSTAND THAT THEN IT SEEMS THAT THE NEXT STEP WHICH OF COURSE COULD BE CARRIED OUT IN PARALLEL RIGHT THAT T HAT WORK CAN BE DONE ALONGSIDE WORK WHERE VARIOUS ELEMENTS WITHIN THOSE CIRCUITS ARE TWEET JUST RIGHT LIKE THE TUNING OF A PIANO IN THE SUBTLE WHI OR MAYBE EN LIKE THE REPLACEMENT OF A WHOLESETA KEYS IF THE PIANO'S LACKING KEY SO RETY YOU'VE BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN TRIN TO GENERATE THOSE TOOLS TO AM TELL US ABOUT CHANNEL OBSINS WHY YO CREATED THEM AND WER THEREAT NOW IN THE LABORATORY AND PERHAPS ALSO IN THE CLINIC WELL THIS IS A FIRST WHEL I GIVE NATURE A THE CREDIT FOR FOR CREATING CHAWELREDOBSINS THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL A LITTLE PROTENS THAT ARE MADE BY ALGI SINGLE SELLED GREEN ALGY AND THIS A GREAT STORY IN BASIC SCIENCE THAT AR UNDERSTANDING OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOR SENSATION COGNITION AND ACTION IN OUR BRAINS ALL THE WAY ACK TO A BOTANIST IN THE EIGHTEEN FIFTIES AND EIGHTEEN SIXTIES IN RUSSIA IS WHERE THE STORY BEGINS SO THIS WAS A A BOTANIST NAMED ANDRE FAMINSIGN WHO A WORKED AT SAINT PETERSBURG AND HE I HAD NOTICED IN THE RIVER A NEAR HIS LABORATORY THAT THERE WERE ALGI THAT HE COULD LOOK AT IN A DITIIN A SAUCER HE COULD PUT THEM THERE AND WE HAD LIGHT SHINING FROM THE SIDE THE GREEN A TINGE IN THA SAUCER OF WATER A WOULD A MOVE TO A PARTICULAR DISTANCE FROM THE LIGHT THAT HE WAS SHINING FROM THE SIDE WHICH WAS AN AMAZING THING IF HE MADE THE LIGHT BRIGHTER A THE GREEN TINGE WOULD BACK OFF A LITTLE BIT TO A MORE AUTOMAL LOCATIONS O JUST THE RIGHT LIGHT LEVEL SO THIS WAS PLANT BEHAVIOR IT WAS LIGHT DRIVEN PLANT BEHAVIOR AND HE DELVES INTO THES A LITTLE BIT HE IDENTIFIED THAT HE MIGHT MY CROSCOPY HE COULD SEE THAT THERE WERE LITTLE SINGLE SELLED ALGY WITH AGELLA THAT WERE SWIMMING A TO THE TO THE RIGHT LIGHT LEVEL SO BEHAVING PLANTS AND TUS HAS BEEN A SECRET THAT'S THAT'S HELPED US ONLOCK A SO MANY PRINCIPLS OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOR SO A TURNS OUT A OU NOT THES ALGI ACHIEVED THIS IN MAZING A RESULTS WITH A SINGLE GENE THAT INCODES SINGLE PROTINE WHAT'S APPROTINE IT'S JUST A LITTLE BYMOCULE THAT DOES A JOB IN HE CELL AND THESE ARE PROTINES THAT SIT IN THE SURFACE OF CELLS IN THEIR SURFACE MEMBRINE AND WHEN A PHOTON A LIGHT PARTICLE HITS THEM A THEY OPEN A LTTLE POR A LITTLE HOLE IN THE MEMBERING AND CHARGED PARTICLES IONS LIKE SODIUM A RUSH ACROSS THE POR NOW WHY DO THEY DO THAT THEY DO THAT TO GUIDE THEIR FLAGELLA THAT SIGNAL COMING IN THOSE IONS COMING IN THROUGH THE POR IN RESPONSE TO LIGHT GUIDE THEIR FLAGELLAR MOTOR THAT GUIDES THEM TO A PARTICULAR SPOT A IN THE SAUCER E NOW THAT'S PLAN BEHAVIOR BUT IT TURNS OUT AS YOU KNOW A THIS MOVEMENT OF IONS ACROSS THE MEMBERING THIS HAPPENS ALSO THE NURL CODE IN OUR BRAINS FOR ON OR OFF O SODYMIONS RUSHING INTO CELLS TURNS THEM ON MAKES THEM FIRE AWAY FIRE ACTION PETENTIALS COMMUNICATE TO THE NEXT CELL DOWN THE THE THE CHAIN AND THIS IS AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE WE CAN BORROW THESE PROTINES IN FACT WE CAN TAKE THE GENE THAT DIRECTS THE CREATION OF THE POTI AND WE CAN USE GENETIC TRICKS MODERN GETICTRICTS TO PUT THAT GENE INTO NURONS IN THE BRAINS OF OF MAMELS A A AND THEN USE LIGHT TO TURN THOSE CELLS THE SPECIFIC CELLS THAT WE PUT THIS GENIU TURN THEM ON THEIR OTHER WA OBSINS WE CALL THEM THAT YOU CAN USE TO TURN CELLS OFF IT'S ALL FAST REAL TIME YOU CAN PLAY IN PATTERNS OF ACTIVITY IN REAL TIME INTO CELLS OR KINDS OF CELLS JUST AS A CONDUCTOR ELICITS THE MUSIC FROM THE ORCHESTRA AND STRINGS IN THE WOODWINDS AND AND AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT MATTERS WHAT MATTERS FOR SENSATION WHAT MATTERS FOR KONDNESSION WHAT MATTERS FOR ACTION AN WE CALL THIS OPTOGENETICS BEAUTIFUL AND I MUST SAY IT WAS QUITE A AN HONOR TOR PRIVILEGE TO WATCH OPTEGENETICS MOVE FROM IDEA TO DISCOVERY TO THE LABORATORY I THINK WE WERE POSTOCS AT THE SAME TIME EREWHICH IS LIVING PROOF THAT A PEOPLE MOVE AT DIFFERENT RATES THAT'S ITS A JOGA AT MY EXPENSE BYTHEA BUT IT'S REAL TUP IN THE SAME SEMN OR LA A PHYSICALLY O PHENOT A PROFESSIONALLY BUTNONE THE LESS A IT'S BEEN A MARVELLOUS STORY THUS FAR AND I'D LIKE TO A MAYBE COULD GIVE US I'D LIKE TO JUST TOUCH ON COUPLE EXAMPLES OF WERE THE TECHNOLOGY RESIDES IN LABORATORIES NOW SO MAY BE THE RANGE OF ANIMALS THAT IT'S BEING USED IN AND SOME OF THE PHENOMENON THAT A CHANNEL OP CHELMERDOSINS AND A AND THERE RELATED A GENES AND PROTINES ARE A S TRYING TO ELIST IT WHAT YOUVE SEEN A AND THEN I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR APPLICABILITY TO THE CLENEK WHICH IS I THINK THAT THE BIGGER MISSION IF YOU WILL SO THIS IS A YOU KNOW THIS THIS A WHOLE THING A YOWIT'SPEN ABOUT NOW GOING ON  SEVENTEEN YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN PUTTING CHANELROD OBSENS INTO NURONS IT STARTED JUST LIKE UNDREY FROM INSON'S WORK IN A IN A DISH A BY TWO THOUSAND THAT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND TWO THOUSAND CEVEN WE WERE PUTTING THESE INTO BEHAVING MICE AND WE WERE ABLE TO TO WITH THE THICK OF A A SWITCH CAUSE THEM TO MOVE ONE DIRECTION OR ANOTHER BY TWO THOUSAND NINE SOA PASE I CAN YOUR CONTROLLING THE MASEIS BEHAVIOR A EXACTLY IN RAAL TIME SO WE COULD MAKE A MOUSE THAT WAS JUST SITTING THERE DOING NOTHING TO THEN TURN LEFT VERY CON SISTENTLY IN FACT GO AROUND IN A CIRCLE IN A SENS WE TURN OFF THE LIGHT IT WOULD STOP THAT WAS AN I OPENING MOMENT A IT TOOK REALLY A FEW YEARS TO MAKE OPTO GENETICS WORK A THERE WAS A LOT OF PUTTING ALL THE THOUR LOT OF PROMS IT HAD TO BE COLVED THESE THESE CHANNEL ORD OPSENS ACTUALLY DON'T MOVE MANY IONS THAT THEY HAVE A SMALL CURRENT SMALL CONDUCTONS AS WE SAY AND SO WE HAD TO FIGURE OUR WAYS TO PACK A LOT OF THEM INTO CELLS WITHOUT DAMAGING CELLS AND STILL MAKE THEM TARGETABLE SO WE DON'T WANT JUST BE IN ALL THE CELLS CAUSE THEN BECOMES JUST LIKE AN ELECTROTYOU'RE JUST STIMULATING ALL THE CELLS THERE NEARBY WE HAD TO KEEP THAT SPECIFICITY MAKE THEM TARGETABLE TO JUST ONE KIND OF CELL OR ANOTHER WHILE STILL PACKING IN LARGE NUMBERS OF THEM INTO THOSE CELLS AND WE HAD TO GET IN THE LIGHT AND SAFE AND SPECIFIC WAYS AND SO IT TOOK PROBABLY ABOUT FOUR FIVE YEARS TO REALLY CREATE OPTO GENETICS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND FOR IN TWO THOUSAND NINE BY THE END OF THAT TIME THOU WE HAD A ALL THE BASIC LIGHT DELIVERY GENE DELIVERY A PRINCIPLES WORKED OUT AND PEOPLE STARTED TO APPLY THE TECHNOLOGY TO A FISH TO RAT TO MICE A TO A NONHUMAN PRIMMATES A LIKE MONKEYS AND JUST A A COUPLEA MONTHS AGO A MY COLLEAGUE A BOTON ROSKA IND SWITZERLAND A SUCCEEDED IN PUTTING A CHANNELRED OSENS INTO THE EYES OF HUMAN BEINGS AND MAKING A BLIND PERSON SEE AND SO THAT'S PRETTY A COOL A THIS WAS A PATIENT A PATIENT WITH RETINAL DEGENERATION AND HEPROVIDED A CHANNELRED OBSTININTO THE EYE OF OF THIS PATIENT WAS ABLE TO CONFER SOME LIGHT SENSITIVITY ON TO THIS PATIENT THAT WASN'T THERE BEFORE IN AMAZING PAPER IN DISCOVERY I  REALIZE IT WAS ONE PATIEN BUT IT'S SUCH IN IMPORTANT MILESTELN AND WELL IT'S IT AS YEU SAY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT MALSTONE AND AND THE THA HISTORY OF THAT IS IS VERY DEEP A ALMOST TEN YEARS EARLIER A BOTON ROSKA AND I HAD PUBLISHED A PAPER IN SCIENCE IN HUMAN RETEN A BUT EXPLANT HAD TAKEN FROM COULD AVERS FROM SOMEONE WHO HAD DIED THE LIVING RETINA TAKING OUT A A OBSENS PUT INTO THIS A A RETINAL TISSUE AN SHOWING THAT T THAT IT WORKED RECORDING FROM THE CELLS SHOWING THAT IN THESE HUMAN NURONS RETINAL MURONS THAT YOU COULD GET LIGHT RESPONSES BUT THEN FROM THAT MOMENT YOU KNOW ALMOST TEN YEARS OF YOU KNOW HOW CLENICAL DEVELOPMENT GOES ENDIS IS IT A GENITHERAPIESE WEU'VE GOT A ALL ALL THE REGULATIONS AND CONCERNS AND ALL THAT IT TOOK ALMOST TEN YEARS TO GET TO TO THIS POINT NOW WHERE A LIVING A HUMAN BEING I HAS A NEW FUNCTION NALITY THAT IT WASN'T THERE BEFORE NOW THAT'S INCREDIBLY INSPIRING YOU KNOW A AND A IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING I WOULD SAY THO THAT THE THE BROAD ER SIGNIFICANCE OF OBTORGETICS IS REALLY STILL UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THE CIRCUITRY WORKS AND WHICH CELLS ACTUALLY MATTER THAN ANY KIND OF TREATMENT BECOMES MORE GROUNDED AND LOGICAL AND SPECIFIC AND PRINCIPALED AND WHETHER IT'S A MEDICATION OR TALK THERE POR BRAIN STIMULATION TREATMENT WITH ELECTRICAL OR MAGNETIC MEANS IF YOU ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT MATTERS THAT IS INCREDIBLY POWERFUL AND I THINK NO NO A YOU KNOW NOT INTENDED TO DESPARAGE THIS THE BEAUTIFUL  NOW RETINAL WORK AND AND CONFERRING U NOVISION ON ON SOMEONE WHOWHO CON SEE OF COURSE THAT'S WONDERFUL BUT THAN THAT'S DIRECT WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL DIRECT OPTOR GENETICS AND PATIENTES INDIRECT IS EVERYTHING THAT COMES FROM UNDERSTANDING YOU KNOW O CAN WE KNOW THESE CELLS MATTER NOW FOR THIS SYMPTOM WELL HOW CAN WE TARGET THATAS THO CELLS AND HELP THEM WORK BETTER IN PATIENCE BY ANY MEANS AND I THINK THAT'S THE THE BROADER SNIFICANCE OF OPTOR GENETICS CLENICALLY YOU ULD I KNOW BOTONDWELL AND AM YOU BOTON SHARE A THIS INCREDIBLE A BIG VISION THAT I THINK ONLY A CLINATION CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND YOUR BEING INCLOSE CONTACT WITH AND A THE SUFFERING OF PATIENCE AS A ULTIMATE MODE OF AIDOR DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES WHICH MAKES ME HAVE TO ASK DID YOU DECIDE TO BECOME A SCIENTIST TO CURE FINE CURES FOR MENTAL DISEASE A NO I DIDN'T A IT'S A IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ACTUALLY LOOK BACK AND AND SEE THE STEPS THAN BROUGHT YOU TO A PARTICULAR PLACE AND THAT WAS NOT A WHAT BROUGHT ME A INITIALLY TO SCIENCE AND AND IT'S SO CATE I THINK TO EMBRACE THE TWIST AND TURNS THAT LIFE A BRINGS OT TO YOU BUT I WAS ALWAYS INTERESTED IN THE BRAIN AND SO A THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT FOR ME STARTED FROM A A VERY EARLY AGE I WAS YOUKNOW TALKED ABOUT BEING INTEROSPECTIVE I I NOTICE FERRIOR WION I HAD A A DEEP LOVE OF OF POETRY AND AND STORIES AND I I WAS A VORACIOUS READER A AND I WAS AMAZED BY HOW WORDS COULD COULD MAKE ME FEEL IN PARTICULAR WAYS JUST THE EVEN EVEN SEPARATE FROM THEIR YOU NW OF COURSE DICTIONARY MEANINGS THA THE RHYTHM AND HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER EVEN SEPARATE FROM MEANING A AND I WAS STUNNED BY POETS THAT COULD USE WORDS IN NEW WAYS THAT WERE EVEN DIVORCED FROM THEIR MEANING AT ALL AND YET COULD STILL TRIGGER SPECIFIC EMOTIONS AN I WAS THETS THIS WAS ALWAYS FASCINATING TO ME SO A YOU KNOW I I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THAT ANDE I WAS INTERESTIN AND AND I BECAME INTERESTED IN THE BRAIN AND I THOUGHT WELL I MAN HAVE TO STUDY THE HUMAN BRAIN A BECAUSE ONLY HUMAN BEINGS CAN A DESCRIBED WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE ENOUGH SO IN IN COLLEGE I BEGAN TO STEER MYSELF TOWARD A MEDICINE AND WITH THE IDEA OF BECOMING A NEROUS SURGEON AND SI I A A CAME HERE A TO A MEDICAL SCHOOL A AND ID AN ENY PEAGE DEA PROGRAMM A PLANNING NUR SURGERY ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE FIRST ROTATION I DID AT THE END OF MEDICAL SCHOOL AS YOU KNOW YOU DO ROTATIONS YOU GO THROUGH DIFFERENT SPECIALTIES AND SOME OF THESE AR REQUIRED ROTATIONS EVERYBODY HAS TO DIS SOME RELECTIVE WHERE YOU CAN YU CAN PICK WHAT YOU WANT TO DO A I ELECTED TO DO NURSE SURGERY FIRST EVEN BEFORE REGULAR SURGERY I WAS THAT SURE I WANTED TO DO IT AND I LOVED IT HAD A FANTASTIC TIME THERE WAS N AMAZING PATIENT WOU HAD A A THYLAMIC DAMAGE AND THERE WAS A NEGLECT IN DROM WHERE THE PATIENT YOU WAS NOT ABLE TO BE AWARE OF SOMETHING THAT WAS YOU KNOW RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM EVEN THOUG THEIR VISION WAS PERVENO THVISION WAS PERFECTLY FINE EXACTLY A AND SO I WAS AND AND I LOVED THE OPERATING ROOM I LOVED A THA THE THE RHYTHM OF O SUITORING AND THE PRECISION OF IT AND AND I LOVE BEING ABLE TO HELP PATIENCE IMMEDIATELY BUT THEN A A REQUIRED A ROTATION WAS IN PSYCHIETRY WHICH I WAS NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO AAT ALL AND THAT A COMPLETELY RESET MY MY WHOLE LIFE THAT THAT EXPERIENCE IN PSYCHIETRY AND AND IT WAS IT WAS  AT THAT MOMENT THAT I SAW THIS IS FIRST OF ALL THE GREATEST NEED THA THE DEPTH OF SUFFERING AND THA AN THE DEPTH OF THE MYSTERY TOGETHER AND ALSO IT WAS I OST FEEL LITTLE GUILTY ABOUT THIS IT'S SO INTERESTING TOO YOU KNOW YES YES THERE'S YES WE CAN HELP YES THERE'S NEED BUT AS A SCIENTIST THIS IS AMAZING THAT SOME ONE'S REALITY CAN BE DIFFERENT FOR MY OWN YOU KNOW WHAT WITH EVERYTHING PHYSICALLY AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL THE SAME A WITH THE MEASURES WE HAVE AND YET WE'VE GOT A DIFFERENT REALITY THAT IS AN AMAZING THING ND IF WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT AN HELP PTLESE PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE A JUST A YOU A MORE THAN ANYBODY COULD ASK FOR AND SO THAT'S THAT'S HOW I AN IT A A TAKING THIS PATH JUST A A A REQUIRED ROTATION IN SYCHINTRY IT ALL STARTED WITH POETRY AND ISTORTED WIT POETRY THAT AT IT AT OF A RESPECT FOR POETRY AR ARE THERE ANY FAVORITES THAT YOU SPEND TIME WITH A ON A REGULAR BASIS I MEAN THOT THE ONES THO WHO GOT ME DOWN THIS PATH A EARLY ON I REMEMBER AND IN CHILDHOD IN HIGH SCHOOL A ABORTIS HAD AN IMMENSE INFLUENCE ON ME A I I I STUDIED SPANISH ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND AND AND A READING HIS WORK HE WAS A A GREAT WRITER HE WROTE BOTH IN AN ENGLISH AND INSPANISH AND AND EING ABLE TO APPRECIATE HIS POETRY BOT N ENGLISH AN  SPANISH WAS WAS A PRETTY NAZING THING NOT MANY A POETS CAN CANYOU'RE BILING  I I NOT I WOULDN'T SAY NOW I BECAME AT ONE POINT I WAS EFFECTUIVAELY FLUENT AND SPANISH AND I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD  MEDICAL SPANISH STILL BECAUSE NOWWY USE A SPANISH ALL THE TIME INNN THE CLINI CARE I WOULDN'T CLAIM FULFLUENCEY BUT IT'S SOMETHING I DEF IS ALL THE TIME THAT'S BEEN VERY HELPFUL  TE CLINIC WHERE HAS THIS WONDERFUL AS THE SON OF AN ARGENTINE I GREW UP HEARING ABOUT IT AND I LEARNED THAT BOR IS FA FAVORITE CITY WITH GENEVA SO I SPENT TIME IN GENEVA ONLY FOR THAT REASON IT'S ALSO TURNS OUT OF YOURAN INTERESTING CITY A SO YOU DEVELOPED METHODS TO CONTROL NERONS WITH THESE ALGY PROTINES USING LIGHT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THERE WAS IS WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A VERY NICE ARTICLE PUBLISH IN THE NEW YORKER I'M DESCRIBING YOUR WORK AND THE CURRENT STATE OF A YOUR WORK AND IN THE LABORATORY IN THE CLINIC AND AN INTERACTION WITH THE PATIENT SO IS AS I RECALL WOMAN WHO IS SEVERELY DEPRESSED AND YOU REPORTED IN THAT ARTICLE SOME OF THE DISCUSSION WITH THIS PATIENT AND THEN IN REAL TIME INCREASE THE ACTIVATION OF THE SO CALLED VAGUS NERVE THIS TENTH CRANIAL NERVE THAT EXSTENDA THE SKULLAN INERVATES MANY THE VICERUN AND BODY WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL FOR CHANNEL REDOPSONS ERE RELATED TYPES OF ALGY ENGINEERING TO BE USED TO MANIPULATE THE VAGUUS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN THAT INSTANCE IT WASNIN CHANNEL OPS AND STIMULATIONS ELECTRICAL STIMLASSION RIGHT OR TO MANIPULATE FOR IN SYNE A VERY SMALL LOCALIZES REGION THE BRAIN LET ME FOR FRAME TE A LOBIT DIFFERENTLY LIGHT OF WHAT WE'RE TIME ATA COUPLEMINUTES AGO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IF SOMEBODY HAS SEVERE DEPRESSION AND THEY TAKE ANY NUMBER OF THE AVAILABLE FARMASUITACALE AGENTS THAT ARE OUT THERE ASSESSORISE SIRATONER GICKE AGENTS INCREASED OPOMINY INCREASE WHATEVER THAT SOMETIMES THEY EXPERIENCE RELIEF BUT THERE OFTEN SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS SOMETIMES THEY DON'T EXPERIENCE RELIEF BUT AS I UNDERSTAND IT CHANNEL OBSONS IN THEIR RELATED TECHNOLOGY IMPRINCIPLE WOULD ALLOW YOU TO TURN ON OR OFF THE SPECIFIC REGIONS OF THE BRAIN THAT LEAD TO THE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTEMS OR MAY BE TURN UP A HAPPINESS CIRCUIT OR AN ORA A A POSITIVE ANTICIPATIEN CIRCUIT WHERE RE WE AT NOW IN TERMS OF BRINGING THIS TECHNOLOGY TO THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND LET'S START WITH BODY AND THEN MOVE INTO THE SKULL SO STARTING WITH THE BODY IS A GOOD EXAMPLE BECAUSE IT HIGH LIGHTS THE OPPORTUNITY AND AND HOW FAR WE HAVE TO GO SO LET'S TAKE THIS EXAMPLE OF VAGUS NERVE STIMULATION SO THE VGUEST NERVE IT'S THE TENTH CRANIAL NERVE IT COMES FROM THE BRAIN IT GOES DOWN IT ENERVATES THE HEART EVATES THE GUT BY ENERVATE I MEANS IT SENDS LITTE CO N ACTIONS DOWN TO HELP A GUIDE WHAT HAPPENS IN THESE THESE ORGANS  IN THE ABDM AND CHEST A IT ALSO COLLECTS INFORMATION BACK AND AND THERE'S INFORMATION COMING BACK FROM ALL THOSE ORGANS THAT GO ALSO GO THROUGH THIS VAGUEST NERVE THE TENTH CRANIAL NERVE BACK TO THE BRAIN AND SO THIS IS SOMEWHAT OF A OF A OF A SUPERHIGHWAY TO THE BRAIN THEN IT WAS THE IDEA AND MAYBE THE IDEAS MAYBE WE COULD PUT A LITTLE CUFF A LITTLE ELECTRICAL A A DEVICE AROUND THE VAGUEST NERVE ITSELF AND MAYBE HAVE JUST LIKE A PASTEMAKER BATTERY HAVE A LITTLE OWR SOURCE HERE UNDER THE CLATHICAL EVERYTHING UNDER THE SKIN AND HAVE A LITTLE A CUFF IN AND DRIVE SIGNALS AND MAYBE THEY'LL GET BACK TO THE BRAIN SO A WAY OF GETTING INTO THE BRAIN WITHOUT PUTTING SOMETHING PHYSICAL INTO THE BRAIN AND WHY THE VAGUES I MEAN IT'S THERE BUT AND IT'S ACCESSIBLE THAT'S THE REASOTAT'S THE REASON IF THE REASON GES REALLY YOU'RE NOT GITTING M NOT GETTING SO STIMULATING THE VAGUEST TO TREAT DEPRESSION SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S ACCESSIBLE IT'S STARTED AS ACTI AS AS AN EPILEPSY A TREATMENT IN I IT CAN'T HELP WITH EPLEPSY BUT YES ITS SOMNO GT OTHER LOWS O MEDICINE AS A SCIENTIST I GOT THIS IS WHERE I GET TO CHOCKOLEAND YOU SAY I MEAN THE FIELD OF MEDICINE  FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE FROM FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A SCIENTISTAN OUTSIDER THE FIELD OF MEDICIN AS A FIELD THAT GOES IN IN TICKLES PATH WAYS BECAUSE THE'RE THERE IT'S AM I DON'T KNOW WHAT TOS SAY IT'S AM A LITTLE SHOCKING A AND WE OUGHT AT LEAST IN MY LABORATORY I ALWAYS SAY YOU NEVER DO AN EXPERIMENT BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU YOU DO AN EXPERIMENT TO TEST A SPECIFIC HYPOTHES US I MEAN WE THERE ARE THERE ARE STORIES PEOPLE TELL U SO THAT THE SOLIT THE THE VAGUEST NERVE LANDS ON A PARTICULAR SPOT ON THE BRAIN CALL THE SOLITARY TRACK NUCLIUS WHICH IS JUST ONE SNAPS AWAY FROM THE SERATONE AN OPENME IN THE NORTHERNESO THERE'S A WINK TO CHEMICAL SYSTEMS IN OUT BRAIN THAT MAKE IT A RATIONAL JOY IT YES IT'S NOT I NOT IRRATIONAL BUT I CAN TELL YOU THE EVEN IF THAT WE'RE NOT TRUE THE SAME THING WOULD HAVE BEEN TRIED YOU GOT TO HAT IT DONE AND TAN GOES ITS SUCCESSIBLE AS NOAND AND BUT AND AND WHY WAS IT'S NOT IT AGAIN NOT TO DISPARAGE A WHAT WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN IS BRANCH AN MEDICIND THERE'S IMMENSE SUFFERING TREATMENTS MANY TREATMENTS SDON'T WORK AND AND WE TRY THINGS AND AND THIS IS HOW SO MANY ADVANCES IN MEDICIN HAPPEN YOU THINK ABOUT A KIDNEY DIOSIS WHICH HAS KEPT MANY PEOPLE ALIVE THAT THAT WAS JUST STARTED BY SOME ONE SAYING EH LET'S LET'S TRY THUS MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING GOING UP IN THE BLOOD MAYBE WE CAN DIALIE SOMETHING AND HELPS THEM YET IT WORKED AND AND IT WAS JUST SORT OF A TEST PILOT MENTALITY WE CAN WE CAN ACCESS THE BLOOD LET'S RUN IT ACROSS A DIOSIS MEMBERING PUT IT BACK IN THE BODY O MI GOD AN ACTUALLY WORKS AND SOMETIMES YOU DO NEED THAT THAT TESTPOLITMENT TALITY OF COURSE TO DO IT IN A IN A RIGOROUS SAFE CONTROL AWAY WHICH IS WHAT WE DO AND SO A ANYWAY THAT'S HOW WE WEENDED UP A BUT BUT STILL WITH THE VAGUEST NERVE STIMULATION OF CASE SO WHAT IS IT DOES IT ORK IT HAS IT'S EFTIA APPROVED FOR DEPRESSION OF THIS VAGUEST NURVES TIMULATION BUT ON THE POPULATION LEVEL IF YOU AVERAGE ACROSS ALL PEOPLE THE EFFECTSIZES ARE PRETTY SMALL SOME PATIENCE IT HAS AN AMAZING EFFECT AND I HOW BUT SOME PATIENCE IT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL AND AVERAGE ACROSS EVERYBODY EFFECTSIZES PRETTY SMALL HOW DEATHING IT'S WORKING WHEN IT DOES WORK IS IT TRIGGERING THE ACTIVATION OF OF NURANS THAT RELEASE MORE SARTONE IN OR DOPENME IT COULD BE BUT I WOULD SAY WE DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE FOR FOR THAT A N I I I I JUST DON'T KNOW BUT A WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT IT'S DOSE LIMITED I IN HOW HIGH AND STRONGLY WE CAN STIMULATE AND WHY IT'S BECAUSE IT'S AN ELECTRODE AND IT'S STIMULATING EVERYTHING NEAR BY AND WHEN YOU TURN ON THE VAGUEST NOSTING TERE THE VOICE PATIENT'S VOICE BECOMES STRANGULATED AND HORSE THEY CAN HAVE TROUBLE SWALLOWING THEY CAN TROUBLE SPEAKING FOR SURE I EVEN SOME TROUBLE BREATHING BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN THE NECK EVERY ELECTRICALLY RESPONSOV CELL AND PROJECTION IN THE NECK IS BEING AFFECTED BY THE SELECTRATE AND SO YOU CAN GO UP JUST SO FAR WITH THE INTENSITY AND THEN YOU HAVE TO STOP SO YOU KNOW TO TO YOUR INITIAL QUESTION COULD A MORE PRECISE STIMULATION METHOD A LIKE OPTOGENIC'S HELP IN THE SETTING IN PRINCIPLE IT COULD BECAUSE HAVE UT IF YOU WOULD TARGET THE LIGHT SENSITIVITY TO JUST THE RIGHT KIND OF CELL LET'S SAY SELL ACS THAT GOES FROM POINT A A POINT ME THAT YOU KNOW CAUSES SYMPTOM RELIEF OF PAPRTICULAR KIND THEN YOU'RE IN BUSINESS YOU CAN HAVE NOT BE THE ONLY SELL THATSLIGHT SENSITIVE YOU NOT CAN AFFECT ANY OF THE OTHER CELLS THE LARINGS IN THE FAIRYINGS IN THE PROJECTIONS PASSING THROUGH SO THAT'S THE HOPE THAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROBLEM IS THAT WE DON'T YET HAVE THAT LEVEL OF SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE WE DON'T KNOW O K IT'S THE CELL STARTING IN POINT A GOING TO POINT BE THAT RELIEVES THIS PARTICULARS AND WE WANT TO FIX THIS KEY ON THE PIANO AND THEN I SEE TWO OTHER A STEPS THERE REQUIRED ONE IS TO GET THE CHANNEL OPSIN GENE INTO THE CELL IN THE CASE OF BUTTON ROSCIAN COLLEGUES A RESCUING VISION IN THIS PATIENT UM THEY DID THAT BY AN INJECTION OF A VIRUS THAT DOESN'T DAMAGE THE NURONS THE VIRUS ITSELF IS FAIRLY INNOCUS UM BUT CARRIES A CARGO AND INTO ONE TIME INJECTION THE SELLS EXPRESS AND THEN THEY USED LIGHT TO STIMULATE SO AM LET'S SAY I'M DEPRESSED ON WHICH I DON'T THINK I AM ALTHOUGH NOW SCITING IN FROR TECATREST AU PROBABLY CAN SEE SIGNS THAT MAYBE I AM OR MAYBE 'M NOT BUT A LET'S IT WE PUT CHANNEL OPSEN IN TO MY A SPECIFIC BRANCH OF THE VAGUEST THAT WE UNDERSTAND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MOOD A HOW WE GAN TO GET IT IN THERE AND THEN HOW WE GAN TO DELIVER THE LIGHT CAUSE WE'RE NOT SOING ABOUT SUN LIGHT WORE STANDING IN FRONT OF HE LIGHT BALL NECESSARILY BUT WHAT A WHAT ARE THE MECHANISMS FOR THE BODY SO WE HAD TO SOLVE EXACTLY THESE QUESTIONS YOU'RE SAYING HOW DO YOU GET THE LIGHT AND HOW DO YOU GET THE GEN AND IN A IN A POTENT AND ROBUST IN SAFE WAY AND IT'S THAT'S NOW SOLVED AND THAT'S NOT A A CHALLENGE SO THERE ARE VERY SAFE WELL TOLERATED A A GENE DELIVERY MECHANISMS THAT ARE CALLED ADNO ASSOCIATED VIRUSES A VS AND THESE ARE A THINGS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMMON COLD THEY THEMSELVES DON'T CAUSE A ANY SYMPTOMS THEY'VE BEEN ENGINEERED AND THERE'S BEEN A BROAD COMMUNITY OF A VIRAL ENGINEERING THIS BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES MAKING THESE A SAFER WELL TOLERATED AND TEN SO ON WE CAN PUT THE CHANNELREDOSIN GENE INTO THESE A VIRAL VACTORS A THAT DELIVER THE THE GEN  AND WE CAN HAVE LITTLE BITS OF ADDITIONAL DEINA THAT GOVERN EXPRESSION ONLY IN ONE KIND OF CELL BUT NOT ANOTHER THESE ARE CALLED PROMOTERS AND NHANSERS ALL GENETIC TRICKS BUILT UP BY A VERY BROAD COMMUNITY OF AF GREAT SCIENTISS OVER THE DECADES WE CAN PUT THESE DIFFERENT BITS OF DEINA PACKAGE THEM INTO THIS A  V THES IL VIRUS AND THAT IT CAN BE THEN INJECTED A INTO A PARTICULAR PART OF THE BODY I AND STICKING WITH THIS VAGUEST NERVE EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT THEIR PARTICULAR CLUMPS OF NURONS THERE'S ONE CALLED THE NOTOS GANGLIAN A THAT HAS A CLUMP OF SELLS RELATED TO THE VGUEST NERVE AND YOU COULD FOR EXAMPLE TARGET A LITTLE INJECTION INTO THAT GANGLI AN WOULD NOT BE AN OUT PATIENT PROCEDURE TO COME IN IN THE MORNING GET YOUR INJECTION MAY WALK OUT A FEW HOURS LATER ANSWERING AND SO THAT'S THE GENE A THEN THE LIGHT DELIVERY THIS IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT THAT A WEVE WORKED OUT WEVE WORKED ON MAKING VERY VERY LIGHT SENSITIVE OBSINS ONE CHALLENGE AND AN A BOTON A A WOULD BE THE THE FIRST TO STATE THIS IN FACT INSOLVING THIS PROMLOM FOR THE PATIENT HE HAD TO BUILD A GOGGLES THAT A CREATED MUCH BREAT MUCH BRIGHTER LIGHT THAN THE NORMAL AN BE AN LIGHTA DELIVERY BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED EARLY AR YOU HAVE TO PACK A LOT OF THESE CHANNEL NOBSINS IN THEY DON'T HAVE MUCH CURRENT YOU HAVE TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT YOU'VE GOT TENSE ENOUGH LIGHT TO ACTIVATE ENOUGH OF THEM TO CAUSE A STIMULATION AND HAS TO BE THE RIGHT WAVELAY I  BE THE R GOING MAK TO YOUR EXAMPLE OF THE ALOGY MOVING TOWARD OR AWAY A A DELIGHT IT IT HAS TO BE TUNE JUST RIGHT SO COULD YOU AR COULD I'M IMAGINING IN MY MIND AS A NON ENGINEER I KNOW YOU ALSO WILL BY HOENGINEER THE I'M IMAGINING A LITTLE TINY A BLUE LIGHT EMITTING A THING OBJECT THAT A LITTLE BIGGER THAN A CLUMP OF CELLS OR MAYBE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A CLUMP OF CELLS AND FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW YOU KNO YOUR CREDIT CARDID IS ABOUT TWO HUNDERD MY A MY CRONS THICK ON THE SIDE AND ON MY CRON IS HE THOUSANDS OF A MILLIMETER AND SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LITTLE TINY STAMP A THAT BASICALLY A HALF A MILLIMETER IN SIZE A ALL AROUND EACH ADGE HALF A MILLIMETR INSIZEI CAN IMAIN THAT BEING PUT UNDER MY SKIN AND THEN I WOULD WHAT ID A HID AN AP ON MY PHONE AND I'D SAY I SAY DOCTOR DISER OF A'M NOT FEELING GREAT TO DAY CAN I INCREASE THE STIMULATION YOU SAY GO FOR IT AND THEN I RAN BIT UP IS THAT HOGO I MEAN THAT'S EFFECT OF WHAT WE ALREADY DO WITH THE VAGUEST NEIRVE STIMULATIENT THAT THE DOCTOR IN THIS CASE AND I I HAVE THES INC SOM OF MY PATIENTS IN THE CLINIC I DO VAGUUS INER STIMULATION I TALK TO THEM I SAY I I I GO THROUGH THE SYMPTOMS I I USE THE PSYCHATRIC INTERVIEW TO ILLI IT THEIR INTERNAL STATES AND THEN I HAVE A RADIO FREQUENCY CONTROLER THAT I CAN DIL IN  RIGHT THERE IN REAL TART THEN YOU'RE HOLDING THE REMOTE CONTROL ESSENTIALLY TO THEIR BRAIN ALTHOUGH IT'S REMOT REMOTE CTAL THRE EPLESTEP YETA YE AND I CAN I CAN TURN UP I CAN TURN UP THE FREQUENCY I CAN TURN UP THE INTENSITY A ALL WITH THE RADIO FREQUENCY AND I CONTROL AND THEN ITS ITS REPROGRAMMED OR A REDOSE A AND THN THE PATIENT CAN CAN THEN LEAVE AT THE ALTERED DOSE SO THIS IS HAPPENING NOW THIS HAVING RIGHT NOW ELECTRICAL YOU DO THIS ROUTINE HAN I DID RETINE LEAN MI C ELECTRICALLY AND YOUR GETTING THE VERBAL CONTENT WHICH AS YOU DESCRIBED EARLIER IS THE INDICATION OF HOW WELL SOMETHING IS WORKING IN REAL TIME SO THIS MAY BE COULD JUST DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT OF THE INNER ACTION WITH THAT PARTICULAR PATIENT OR OR ANOTHER PATIENT WAT WHAT'S A TYPICAL ARK OF A NARRATIVE AS YOU GO FROM NO STIMULATION TO INCREASED STIMULATION IN MOST IN MOST PATIENCE A THE ACTUAL THEIR PEUTIC EFFECTS THE BENEFITS ACTUALLY TAKE I I MANY DAYS TWO WEEKS A AND SO WHAT I'M MOSTLY FOCASING ON IN THE OFFICE IN REAL TIME IS MAKING SURE I'M IN A SAFE LOW SIDE EFFECT I REGIME AND SO FIRST I TALK O THE PATIENT YOU HOW WHOWHO HAS BEEN ON A PARTICULAR DOSE OF THE STIMULATION FOR WEEKS OR OR OR LONGER AND I I I TALK ABOUT SYMPTOMS HOW WERE THINGS OVER THE PAST A MONTH HOW IS YOUR HOPE HOW IS YOUR ENERGY LETTEL A SLEEP I YOU KNOW HOW WHAT IS YOUR MOOD A AND AND THEN WE TALK WITH THE PATIENT WE DECIDE ALL THIS IS THIS IS NOT YET WHERE WED LIKE TO BE AND SO THEN I CAN TURN UP THE INTENSITY OF THE STIMULATION REAL TIME IN THE OFFICE I DON'T IN MOST PATIENCES I DON'T EXPECT AN IMMEDIATE MOOD CHANGE WHAT I DO IS I INCREASE THA THE DOSE UNTIL A I I NEXT LEVEL LOP WHILE ASKING THE PATIENT FOR SIDE EFFECTS CAN YOU STILL BREATHE O C CAN YOU STILL SWALLOW CA AND I CAN HEAR THEIR VOICE IS WELL AND AND I CAN GET IN YOUR LOOKING AT THEIR FAN LOOKING AT THEIR FACE ANCE I CAN GET A SENSE IS THERE A AM I IN A STILL ON A SAFE SIDE EFFECT I REGIME AND I AND AND AND THEN YOU NIGHT I I I STOP AT A PARTICULAR POINT THAT LOOKS SAFE AND THEN PATIENT GOES HOME COMES BACK A MONTH LATER AND I GET THE REPORT ON HOW THINGS OR  THAT MONTH I ASKED A IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR FACE CAS IN YOUR BOOK A YOU DESCRIBE THE INCREDIBLE COMPLEXITY OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND AT ONE POINT YOU DESCRIBE THE INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT THE EYES INFORM ABOUT THE BRAIN AND AND THE CONTEXT OF SOMEBODY'S INNER EXPERIENCE WHETHER DEPRESSED OR HAPPY OR OTHERWISE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET BACK TO HOW TO MANEUVER THEM AND MANIPULATE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM FOR SAKE OF MENTAL HEALTH BUT WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR SO AS A VISION SCIENTIST I THINK YOU DON'T PUPILS DILATING IS A SIGN OF AROUSAL BUT THAT COULD BE A POSITIVE AROUSAL POSIVE AILANCE LIKE EXCITEMENT OR IT COULD BE TERROR YOU'REGING TO GET THE SAME DILATION OF THE PUPILS A AND AND I'M ALWAYS REMINDING PEOPLE OF THESE TWO GOODIESE ARE TWO PIECES OF BRAIN BASIFORLY THEY'RE JUST OUTSIDE THE CRANIAL VAULT SO THEY'RE NOT UNLIKE THE VAGUEST IN THAT SENS BUT THEY'RE MORE OF A REPORT THEN A CONTROL NOB ALTHOUGH THE I LIKE TO THINK THEY COULD BE USED AS CONTROL NOBS TO A SO WITHOUT PUT ANG YOU ON THE SPOT AGAIN TO DIAGNOSE ME NO SONENLY I WOULDE NEVER ASK YOU TO DO I WHAT THE CAMERAS ROLLING BUT A WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR THAT THE PATIENT MIGHT NOT BE AWARE OF IN OTHER WORDS CAN YOU SEE DEPRESSION IN PSOMEBODY'S EYES AND IF YOU KNOW A PATIENT OR IF YOU DON'T CAN YOU SEE IT IN THERE BODY POSTURE WHEN THEY WALK IN REALIZING OF COURSE THAT A TRAIN PSYCHIATRIS LIKE YOURSELF DEVELOPS AN INTUITIVE SENSE THAT'S AGGREGATING LOTS OF DIFFERENT FEATURES OF IMPATIENT BUT WHAT ABOUT THE EYES WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON THERE THE EYES ARE INCREDIBLY RICH IN INFORMATION AND A AS YOU SAYS YOU ALUDE TO THOUGH IT'S NOT AS IF ANY ONE MISERABLE CONVEYS ALL THE INFORMATION YOU NEED IT'S WHAT WE YOU KNOW WHAT AN ENGINEER WOULD SAY JOINTS ISIS IXIT ITS IT'S MANY THINGS ALL AT ONCE WHETHER THEY'RE INSYNCRANY OR OUT OF SYNCRANY THAT THAT ACTUALLY A TURNS OUT TO MATTER AND A YOU NOW THE EYE CONTACT QUESTION WE ALL KNOW I CONTACT IS INCREDIBLE IMPORTANT YOU DON'T FEEL CONNECTED WITH WITH SOMEBODY UNLESS YOU UNLESS THEIRE'S MI CONTACT BUT I CONTACT CAN GO ALL RIGHT TOO IT IT CAN BE A IT CAN BE TOO INTENSE OR IT CAN BE MIS TIME OR IF THERE'S A SOME WITHTH AUTISM IT CAN BE BARELY THERE AT ALL AND AND THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING SYMPTOMS OF AUTISM AS THE AVOIDANCE OF A VI CONTACT  AS IF IT'S  IS IF IT ALMOST AS IF IT'S A HARMFUL AA A QUANTITY AND SO IS AN I IMMENSE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION YOU CYOU GET FROM THE EYES  BUT IT'S IT'S THE PAIRING OF WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE EYES WITH EVERYTHING ELSE GOING ON THE BODY LANGUAGE THA WHAT'S A VERBAL CONTENT OF WHAT'S WHAT'S COMING OUT ALL THAT TOGETHER IS IS IS IS THE ART OF OF PSYCHATRY AND AND SOCIAL INTERACTION BUT YU KNOW SOMETIMES YOU DON'T HAVE THE EYE CONTACT ND THIS IS A NAMAZING THING AND I DO TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE BOOK AS WELL IN IN MANY CASES YOU KNOW IN PSYCHAETRY SOMETIMES IT'S OVER THE PHONE THAT YOU HAVE TO A MAKE KEY DECISIONS AND AS A N I I RECALL YOUNR VIVIDLY BEG AS A RESIDENT A VERY OFTEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE THESE PHONE CALLS FROM A A PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN THE HOSPITAL PEOPLE YOU CAN'T SEE CAN'T SEE THER I CAN'T SEE THEIR BODY ANYTHING ABOUT THEM JUST THE SOUND OF THEIR VOICE AND YOU CAN ASK THEM QUESTIONS AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE IN SOME CASES LIFE OR DEATH DECISIONS IS THIS PERSON TRULY SO S IDLE SOMETHING LIKE THAT AS COMES UP ALL THE TIME AND SO I DEVELOPED OVER THE COURSE OF TRAINING A AND I THINK ALL ALL SYCHIUST DO THIS IS YOU DEVELOP A WAIT A WHATEVER DATISTREAM YOU HAVE WHETHER IT'S THE EYES OR WHETHER IT'S JUST THE SOUND OF VOICE COMING OVER THE PHONE YOU LEARN TO HOME IN ON THAT DATI STRAM YOU HAVE AND FOCUSS ON IT AND IDENTIFY CHANGES AND IT'S QUITE AMAZING II'VE FOUND THAT OU  CAN ACTUALLY A IF YOU KNOW A PATIENT YOU CAN DETECT VERY PRECISE CHANGES IN MU JUST FROM THE SOUND OF THE VOICE AND AND YOU CAN  HAVE AA REALIZATION THAT ALL THIS PATIENTS DEPRESSION IS INTRUVED Y BY BY ABOUT HALF JUST BY THE TONE OF THER OF THEIR VOICE AND SAME WITH EYES YOU CAN WITH ENOUGH PRACTICE YOU CAN GET IN NOUGH INFORMATION FROM THE SINGLE DAY TO STRAME TO GIVE YOU SOME INFORMATION BUT WHEN YOU DO HAVE THE WHOLE PICTURE THAT OF COURSES BESS SO UM SO MANY THEORIES OUT THEREABOUT UM EXCESSIVE BLINKING AND LYING A LACK OF BLINKING IN SOCIOUT WITH THE UM I LIKE TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT A PEOPLE HAVE VARYING DEGREES OF LUBRICATION OF THE EYES YO TO ALSO INFLUENCE THE FREQUENCY OF BLINKING AND PRESUMELY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH A WHETHER NOT WHAT THEIR SAYING IS TRUE OR NOT A BUTTING INCREDIBLE NONE THE LESS THAT IT'S THAT THE EYES ARE A PORT OLD TO OVER ALL AROUSALS TAT UNFASTENING BY THE FACTS OF LIGHT ON CIRCATING BOLOGING JUST OVER ALL DESIRE TO BE AWAKE OR ASLEEP ET CETERA UM SO THE EYES ARE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE CRANIAL VAULT THE VAGUUST IS OUTSIDE A THE A THE CRANIEG OF ALL OBVIOUSLY UM WHAT ABOUT THE GOODIES IN HERE UM PARKINSONS WE KNOW THE AT LEAST ONE OF THE MAJOR SIGHTS OF DEGENERATION AND FAILURE THAT LEAD TO THOSE SYMPTOMS AM I CAN AME OFF ANY NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS IN YOUR BOOK YOU TALK ABOUT THE BEAUTIFUL WORK DONE WITH OPTICENETICS OF ACTIVE VERSISE PASSIVE COPING THAT THEIR AIRS OF THE BRAIN LIKE THE BANULA THAT MAKE A WHEN ACTIVE MAKE ANIMALS AND PRESUMELY PEOPLE A PASSIVE AND UNWILLING OR UNINTERESTED IN FIGHTING BACK AGAINST PRESSURES OF LIFE WHERE IS ANOTHER REGION THE RAFE YOU STIMULE LIKE THAT AND AND THEY ACTIVELY COPE THEY THEY GET THEIR GRICT GOING AND THEY AND THEY ARE ABLE TO LEAN INGTO LIFE SO HOW DO HOW DOES ONE GET TO THOSE STRUCTURES IN IT IN A FOCUST WAY AND UM WHAT WHAT IS THE NEXT TO TOF FIVE TO TEN YEARS LOOK LIKE WELL THIS IS THIS IS THE PROMISE ON THAT AND IT IS ON A TIME SCALE ATHAT I THINK THINGS MAY  START TO PLAY OUT YOU KNOW THAT THE SPECIFICITY OFOUT TA GENETICS A IS REALLY ONLY USEFUL IF YOU HAVE SOME ID OF HOW TO USE THAT SPECIFICITY AM AND IT'S IN ACTUALLY ITS A FRUSTRATING ASPECT OF PSYCHIATRY THAT IN MANY CASES THE MOST EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS WE HAVE HAVE THE LEAST SPECIFICITY ELECTRIC CONVOST EFTHERAPY BEING A GREAT EXAMPLE WHERE YOUR CAUSING A BRAIN WIDE WHICH LOOKS AT BARBARIC BUT AS YOU MENTION IS EFFECTIVE I MEAN IT IS IT THESE DAYS IT'S IT'S MUCH MORE CLINICALLY I YOU KNO DOHINT LOOK LIKE ONE FLUID THE LAS SCENE AND LATNOT ON FLOOR OVER THE CUCAN AS NOW IT'S A VERY CLINICALLY A SAFE AND STABLE PRECEDURE BUT I OUGHT WHAT WERE I I I WOULD SAY YET IS IT IS IT'S GOT THIS ALMOST MEDIEVAL LACK OF O SPECIFICITY EVEN IF THE PROCEDURES WELL CONTROL IN N CLINICALLY SAFE AND STABLE AND IT IT HAS A IT'S NOT VERY SPECIFIC YOUR CAUSING A BRING WHY SESURE HOW HOW COULD YOU BE LESS SPECIFIC THAN THAT AND WE DON'T KNOW THAT THE THE SOURCE OF THE RELIEF WE DON'T WE ANLY IT'S A DUMP OF NEROMODULATOR PSYC DOPEMIN IN SAD ETON WE DON'T THERE CERTAINLY IS A DUMP OF NOR NOLETTERS WE DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S THE THE THE CAUSE FOR THE RELIEF I AND LIKEWISE WITH MEDICATIONS THIS IS AN ALSO AN INTERESTING THING SO SOME OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE ANTITEPRESCENCE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE ANTYPSYCHOLICS OR TH ONCE THAT AR HAVE THE MOST SIDE EFFECTS AND MANY EXAMPLES OF THIS FOR EXAMPLE THE MOST EFFECTIVE ANTYPSYCHOTIC  SOMETHING CALLED CLOUSIPINE WHICH HAS SOME QUESTIALLY HAS THE MOST SIDE EFFECTS A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE I A DEFOR ANTAGON IT HAS FASE WE EVERY RECEPTOR DOES IT REARLY IT ACTS  INTERESTING IT I HAS PROMINENT SERTONAND PROMINENT MUSCERINIC I CERTAINLY ACTS ON DONP MEAN OUR SEPTORS BUT I IT HAD NCAUSES A YOU KNOW BLOOD  BLOOD SELL A COUNTS HOWTPLE FEOR SO IF IF IF FUM IF I WERE SKIS O FRENIC AND A I SEEING AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS ET CETERA AND I TOOK CLOSOPINE AM WHAT COULD I EXPECT TO FEEL WELL  SO YOU WOULD NOTICE A PSIDE EFFECTS AND YOU WOULD NOTICE RESOLUTION OF OF SYMPTOMS BOTH AND SON THE VOICES WOULD GO AWAY IF IN IN A GOOD SITUATION  WHTHE VOICES WE GO WAY BUT I WOULD FEEL NOT GOOD IN MY BODY YOU WOULD HAVE A YOU MIGHT HAVE DIZZINESS YOU MIGHT HAVE A DRUING HE MIGHT HAVE I ANY NUMBER OF A A A PHYSICAL SENSATIONS THAT THAT WOULD BE DUETO THESE OFF TARGET EFFECTS THA THE MADICATION ACTING ON THESE OTHER RECEPTORS AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT SUGGESTING THIS BUT WOULD IF SOMEBODY WITHOUT SKIS OFFRENIATO CLOSOPINE I YOU HAVE THE SAME SIDE EFFECTS PRESUMABLY A AND SO WOULD NOT BE SOMETHING THAT THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU PSYCHIATREST TAKE THE DRUGS THAT THEY PRESCRAE I JUST FINISHD UP FOR THE THIRD TIME OLIVER SACES A AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHICH IS MARVELLOUS AND AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND A PEOPLE A HE CERTAINLY TOOK A LOT OF DRUGS AM E NOT AS PART OF ITS PROFESSIONAL ROLL AM BUT JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY WHAT IS THE INTEREST OR CON OF ROLL OF OF DRUGS IN THE FIELD OF PSYCHIATRY BEGETS FOR I WOULD IMAGINE FOR A GROUP OF VERY CURIOUS INTERESPEC CTIVE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT WHAT TO TAKE THERE COULD ACTUALLY BE SOME BENEFIT FOR UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE EXPERIENCE OF THOSE DRUGS AS LIKE FOR THEIR PATIENT I THINK THAT THAT'S TRUE AND I I WILL SAY THAT COVYN MANY OR MOST PSYCITURS HAVE A A A SAMPLE THA NUMBER OF THESE FOR EXACTLY THE REASON THAT YOUR SAYING IS IS TO UNDERSTAND BETTER AND TO HELPETREAT THEIR PATIENTS BETTER AND IE IVE SPOKEN TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE YOU KNOW REALLY BEEN  IHAVE FOUND THIS VERY HELPFUL TO NOC THIS THIS SLEEP DESCRUPTION CAUSED BY THIS MEDICATION OR THE LIBIDO DESCRUPTION CAUSE BY THIS OTHER MEDICATION WHILE THAT IS THAT IS A BIG AFFACTION AND AND IT REALLY HELPS WITH EMPATHY FOR THE FOR THE PATIENTS TO UNDERSTAND I'M NOT SUGI NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE PHYSICIONS OR ANYBODY A A EXPERIMENT WITH DRUGS BUT I BUT I AM RELIEVED TO HEAR THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT WHEN YOU TALKING ABOUT ACT ACCESSING SOMEBODY'S MIND END THEIR BASIC PHYSIOLOGY AS YOU MENTION RELATE TO APPETITE LIBIDO IN SLEEP YO REALLY YOU REALLY A ONE IS ACTING IS A MECHANIC OF OF THEIR THE PERSONS WHOLE EXPERIENCE THEY WALK OUT THE OFFICE AND THEY HAVE A A LIFE EXPERIENCE A THAT EXTENDS BEYOND THE SCRIPT  AND SO AND YET AND SO THAT SO AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH YOU CAN'T LET THAT COMPLETELY GUIDE YOUR CLINICAL DECISIONS BECAUSE S I MENTIONS SOME OF THESE MEDICATIONS HAVE THE MOST SIDE EFFECTS THEY ARE ALSO THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND CLOSIPINS AF GREAT EXAMPLE THAT WILL WORK IN  PATIONTS WHERE NOTHING ELSE WORKS AND BELIEVE ME WE DON'T TAKE THE STEP OF OF CLOUSIPING A PRESCRIPTION LIGHTLY BECAUSE OF ALL THESE THE SIDE EFFECTS YOU HAVE TO COME IN FOR WEEKLY BLOOD SO OR EVERY FEW WEEKS A BLOOD SELF CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BLOOD COUNTS ARE NOT OFF I FOR EXAMPLE BUT THEIR PATIENTS WHERE NO OTHER MEDICATION WORKS WAS SCETS A FOR NE AND CLOUSIPING WORKS MASING MOR WELT AND AND AND SO WE DO IT EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE THE SIDE EFFECTS AND SO THEN THIS COMES BACK HERE YOUR QUESTION WHAT IF WE HAD BETTER AN BETTER SPECIFECITY WELL ONLY IF WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WERE DOING IS THE POINT AND SO BECAUSE AS WE BECOME MORE REFINED I WE BETTER BE RIGHT ABOUT WHERE WERE REFINING TO AND YOU MACTION A DAY WHERE IT WILL BE A SINGLE A MAYBEEN OUTPATIENT NOR A SURGERY WOULD GO IN THROUGH THE SCHOLOR THE BACK OF THE YEAR DELIVER A SMALL VIRAL INJECTION WONE THESE ADENOF ORS IS A LITTLE STICKER A LIGHT OMITTING DIOED IS THAT A IT DEEPEN THE BRAIN IS THAT HOW YOU INVISION THIS OF IT THAT CERTAINLY COULD HAPPEN WHAT I WHAT I ACTUALLY A PREFER AS A VISION IS IS STILL MEDICATIONS A BECAUSE  THOSE ARE YOU KNOW MENLY INVASIVE I IF WE KNEW WHAT WE WERE DOING WE COULD MAKE THEM MORE SPECIFIC I HAVE FEWAR SIDE EFFECTS BUT OPTROGENETICS THATLE ARM US WITH TRUE CAUSAL UNDERSTANDING AND SO WELL KNOW I AND WE'RE ALREADY MOVING RAPIDLY TOWARD THIS POINT WILL KNOW OKE THIS SYMPTOM THE LOSS OF PLEASURE IN LIFE THAT WE CALL ANHENDONIA OR THE LOSS OF OF MOTIVATION OR OR OR ENERGY TO OVERCOME CHALLENGES ACTIVE COPING AM THESE ARE LARGELY SUBSURD ERVED LARGELY CONTROL BY THE CIRCUIT OR THAT CIRCUIT OR THE CELL THATS INHABITS THES OTHER CIRCUIT AND WE WILL KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF THE WORK DONE WITH CHANNEL OPS EXACTLY YI AGREE IT AS THAT WE WE NEVER COULD HAVE THE CONFIDENCE OTHERWISE  AND SO WE'LL KNOW THAT THIS IS THE CIRCUIT THAT THAT UNDERLIES THE SYMPTOM OR ITS RESOLUTION AND THEN WELL GET TO UNDERSTAND THESE CELLS VERY DEEPLY OKET THESE CELLS THAT ARE CAUSAL THAT DO MATTER WHO ARE THEY WHAT AE THEY WHAT'S THEIR WIRING WHAT ARE THE PROTEENS THAT THEY MANKE WHAT ARE THE LITTLE THINGS THAT ARE ON THE SURFACE OF THE CELL THAT COULD BE RECEPTORS FOR SPECIFIC MEDICATIONS OR COMBINATIONS OF RECEPTORS THAT WOULD GIVE US THE SPECIFICITY WE NEED AND THEN ARMED WITH THAT CAUSAL AND PRECISE AND RIGOROUS KNOWLEDGE THEN YOU CAN IMAGINE MEDICATIEN DEVELOPMENT BECOMING TOTALLY DIFFERENT NO LONGER SARNDIPITUS BUT TRULY GROUNDED AND CAUSALITY I SEE SO USING CHANNEL OBSENS IS A WAY TO PROBE THE CIRCUITRY AND FIGURE OUT THE SIGHTS THAT ARE DISERRUPTED WHAT PATTERNS OF ACTIVITY ARE REQUIRED AND THEN BY UNDERSTANDING THE CONSTITUENTS OF THOSE CELLS LIKE WHAT THEY EXPRESS AND WHAT THEY MAK THEN DEVELOPING DRUGS THAT COULD TARGET THOSE CELLS NOT NECESSARILY PUTTING LIGHT INDUCING DIODES INTO THE BRAIN OR WALKING AROUND WITH WIRE PACKS ATTACHED TO OUR SCHOLAR SONME TH TH THAT'S FANTASTIC AN AND YOU I I REALIZED NO ONE HAS A CRYSTAL BALL BUT AM WHAT DO YOU THINK THE ARK OF AM OF THAT IS MEANING ARE WE CAN A SEE THAT IN A YEAR IN TWO YEARS THREE YEARS IN LET ME REFRAME THAT IF HOW SOON WILL A PILL BASED TREATMENT FOR A PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE BE AVAILABLE THAT TARGETS A SPECIFICS AT OF CELLS THAT WE KNOW OR IMPORTANT BEBECAUSE OF THE WORK DONE WITH CHANNEL OBSEN I THINK A THAT IS IN SOME WAYS IT'S ALREADY I HAPPENING AT THE LEVEL OF INDIVIDUAL PATIENCE  AND HERE IT STAMFOR YET YET A AND AND IN MORE BRODLY IN TERMS OF A NEW NEW DRUGS NEW MULTI CENTER YOU KNOW A CLINICAL TRIALS THAT'LL PLAY OUT OF THE NEXT A FEW YEARS A AND THESE COULD BE DRUGS THAT ARE ALREADY SAFE AND A TRUE ROTHER PURPOSES  BUT WE MIGHT SAY OCAY NOW WE KNOW THAT THIS MEDICATION A BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW FROM CAUSAL OPTOGATICS THI COULD BE USEFUL FOR THIS OTHER PURPOS THI PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOM AND SO THE PATH A TO TO HELPING PATIENCE IS COULD BE RELATIVELY A SWIFT THAT'S VERY EXCITING WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT A BRAIN MACHINE INHER FACE AND AM NORAL LINK ALWAYS COMES UP ALTHOUGH I DO ONE TO POINT OUT IT A A TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR THE FOLKS AT NURL LINK CAN CLEING SOMEONE WHO CAME UP THROUGH MY LAB IS NOW THERE IS A NURROU SURGEON BUT A THE BRAIN MACHINE IN HER FACEOS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING OR A LONG TIME NOW SOME SOME OF THE BEST WORK AAMONG THE BEST WORK BEING DONE HERE STAMFORD AND ELSEWHERE TO OF COURSE HOWAS THE WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBE COMPATIBLE WITH OR DIFFERENT THIN BRAIN MACHINE IN HER FACE MEANING DEVICES LITTE PROBESAR GIN A STIMULATE DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF ACTIVITY AND ON SUMBLES OF NURANS AND WHAT ARE YOUR GENERAL THOUGHTS ABOUT A BRAIN MACHINE IN HER FACE AS GOING FORWARD NOW I MEAN IT THIS IS A FIRST OF ALL IT'S AN IT'S AN AMAZING A PSCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY APPROACH A AS YOU MENTION WE AND OTHERS HERE IT STAMFORD ARE USING A ELECTRS COLLECTING INFORMATION FROM TENS OF THOUSANDS OF NURANS IN HUMANS I SHOULD ADT AND EVEN YES THERE'S THERE'S A T IT IS QUITE EVEN SEPARATE FROM THE NURLINC WORK AS YOU POINT OUT MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS A A A INHUMANS AS WELL AS A NON HUMAN PRIMATES A AND THIS IS PRETTY A POWERFUL IT'S IMPORTANT THIS WILL LET US A UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE BRAIN IN AIN PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE IN OUR LOGICAL DISEASE ANW'LL GIVE A S YDEAS FOR FOR TREATMENT A IT IS OF COURSE IT'S STILL A INVASIVE HE STILL ARE TALKING BOUT PUTTING A DEVICE A A INTO THE BRAIN A AND THAT HAS TO BE A TREATED AS A AS AS A SITUATION THAT HAS SOME RISKS AND AND A A STEP THAT US TO BE TAKEN CAREFULLY I SEE THAT AS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE PART OF PSYCHIETRY A IN IN AN LONG RUN ALREADY WITH DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION A APPROACHES WE CAN HELP A PEOPLE WITH PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS AND THAT'S PUTTING JUST A SINGLE ELECTRA NOT EVEN AA COMPLEX YOU KNOW A CLOSE LOOP SYSTEM ERE YOU' BOTH PLAYING IN AN GETTING INFORMATION BACK EVEN JUST A SINGLE STIMULATION ELECTRONE IN THE BRAIN CAN HELP PEOPLE WITH  OSD FOR EXAMPLE A QUITE POWERFULLY AH AND THAT WILL BECOME MUCH MORE POWERFUL WHEN WE GET TO A TRUE BRAIN MACHINE INHER FACE COLLECTING INFORMATION BACK STIMULATING ONLY WHEN YOU NEED TO IF WE COULD IDENTIFY A PATHOLOGICAL ACTIVITY PATTERN PARTICULAR ALMOST LIKE THA THE PRODRUM OR THE EARLY STAGE OF A SEIZURE MAY BE THERE EVENTS HAT HAPPEN LEADING UP TO ON SOME TIME SCALE A A PSYCHIATRIC A SYMPTOM WE COULD INTERVENE IN A CLOSE LOOP WAY DETECT WHAT'S HAPPENING WHAT STARTING TO GO WRONG FEED THAT BACK TO THE BRAIN STIMULATION ELECTURO HAVE IT BE YIN THAT WAY MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE PRINCIPLE THIS IS IS A I THINK AB THAT'S GREAT IT'S IT'S A SOMETHING THAT OF COURSE WILL BE GROUNDED AGAIN AND CAUSAL UNDERSTANDING WILL NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS THAT PATHOLOGICAL PATTERN THAT WERE DETECTING AND WE EETEN KNOW THAT IT MATTERS AND SO AGAIN THAT'S WHERE OTTO GENICS IS HELPING US HELPING US NOW OKE THIS THIS PATTERN OF ACTIVITY IN THESE CELLS IN THESE CIRCUITS THIS DOES MEAN THAT THERE'S A PARTICULAR KIND OF OF SYMPTOM THAT'S HAPPENING BUT ARMED WIT THAT KNOWLEDGE ABSOLUTELY THAT EVEN THE EVEN THE SIMPLE CLOTHES LOOP DEVICE DETECT IN STIMULATE IS GOIN TO BE RT OF PSYCHATION THE FUTURE AND THEN AND THEN OF COURSE AS YOU GET TO MORSELVES MORE CONNECTIONS THE ABILITY THAT WE HAVE TO HELP PEOPLE L BECOME MORE POWERFUL ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I GET ASKED A LOT IS ABOUT O EIGHTY HT AND ATTENTION DEFASITIV VARIOUS KINDS I HAVE THE A HUNCH THAT ON ONE REASON I GET ASKED SO OFTEN IS THAT PEOPLE ARE FEELING REALLY DISTRACTED AN AN AND  CHALLENGED IN ON FUNNLING THEIR ATTENTION AND THEIR BEHAVIOR BUT NO IN THEIR NUMBER REASONS FOR THAT OF COURSE BUT WHAT IS TRUE EIGHTY EGHT AND WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR IT AND O WHAT IF ANY ROLL FOR CHANNEL OBSINS WHERE THESE DOWNSTREAM TECNOLOGIES THAT YOUR DEVELOPING ON WHAT ARE THEY WHAT ARE THEY OFFER FOR PEOPLE THAT SUFFER FROM EIGHTIATIY OR HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER THAT SUFFERS FROM EIHTY HT  THIS IS A SA PRETTY INTERESTING BRANCH OF OF PSYCHIATRY IS NO QUESTION THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HELPED BY THE THE TREATMENTS UT THERE'S EUACTIVE YOUAN DEBATE OVER YOU NO WHAT FRACTION OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE THESE SYMPTOMS I CAN I SHOULD BE BE A TREATED THIS IS TYPICALLY AT OR ALL A STIMULENTS OF SOME CONCERS ANVLS STANULENCE THAT'S RIGHT ON SO EIGHTY EGHT ITS AS AS ITS NAME SUGGESTED HAS A SYMPTOMS OF AI CAN'T HAVE EITHER HYPERACTIVE A STATE OR AN INATTENTIVE A STATES AND A THOSE CAN BE COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER YOU CAN HAVE A PATIENT WHO WHO A EFFECTIVELY A IS IS NOT HYPERACTIVE AT ALL BUT CAN'T AT REMAIN FOCUSSED ON THE THE WHAT'S GOING ON AROUN SO THE BODY N E MU STILL BUT THEIR THEIR MIND IS DARTING AROUND THAT'S RIGHT WOR THEY CAN BE VERY HYPERACTEVE WITH THEIR BODY  NOVTENS PROBABLY RARELY A SOMEBODY HYPERACTED WITH THEIR BODY WITH THEIR MIND IS STILL ATHOUGH I HAVE TO SAY AND THIS IS A A BENEVOLENT SHOUT OUT TO BUTTON ROSKA BOTON AS AN INCREDIBLY SHARP AND FOCUSSED MIND AND HIS HAND MOVEMENTS ARE EXTREMELY EXACT ALSO SO I DO SOMETIMES WONDER WHETHER NOT OUR BODY MOVEMENTS IN OUR HEAD MOVEMENTS ARE  WHETHER NOT THEIR CORNETER NOT IS ER IS A REDOUT OF  HOW DIRECTED OUR ATTENTION IS I I NOTICE I HAVE TO THINK COMPLEX ABSTRACT THOUGHTS I KNOWS I HAVE TO BE VERY STILL SO MY BODY HAS TO BE ALMOST COMPLETELY UNMOVING FOR ME TO THINK VERY ABSTRACTLY AND AND DEEPLY OTHER PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT SOME PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE RUNNING THEY GET THEIR BEST THOUGHTS I CAN' EN IMAGIN AT MY BRAIN DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY AT ALL HASE TO BE TOLDLY MOSTIWUC SUC  HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT THAT I I I SIT A MUCH LIKE THIS YOU NI I I TRY TO HAVE TIME EIN EACH DAY WHERE I AM AM LITERALLY A SITTING I A ALMOST IN THIS IN THIS POSITION A BUT BUT WITHOUT DISTRACTION AND AN THINKING AND AND SOT'S KIND OF A IT'S ALMOST MEDITATIVE IN SOME WAYS ACCEPT ITS IT'S NOT A TRUE MEDITATION BUT II AM THINKING WELL NOT MOVING YOU'RE STRUCK IF YOUR TRING O STRUCTURE YOUR THOUGHTS YET HAN NOT TIMEA INTERESTING  SO BUT EVERY EADY AS YOU SAY IS IS IS VERY DIFFERENT AND SO WITH WITH HT H T U HAVE THE KE THINGAS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS PRESENT A CROSS DIFFERENT DOMAINS OF LIFE SCHOOL AND HOME TO SHOW THAT IT REALLY IS A PERVASE OF PATTERN  NOT SOMETHING SPECIFIC TO  OF THE TEACHER OF TTHE HOME SITUATION OR SOMETHING AND THEN YOU CAN HELP PATIENCE IT'S INTERESTING THAT THAT EGHT H T IS ONE OF THOSE DISORDERS WHERE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO WORK ON QUANTITATIVE EE G BASE TO DIGNOSES IND SO THERES SOME PROGRESS TOWARD MAKING UP A DIAGNOSIS WITH LOOKING AT PARTICULAR EXTERNALLY DETECTABLE BRAINWAY A RATHESO SKULL CAP GET SOM ELECTROTES THAT DON'T PENETRATE THE SKULL MNS AND THIS CAN BE DONE IN AN HOUR OR TWO HOUR SESSION HAS TO BE DONE IN CLENEK YET IN THE CLENEK I YOU HAVE TOAV THE I RECORDING APPARATUS AN SOM BUT BUT BUT U THAT'S IN PRINCIPLE I AS Y U INCREASING CONFIDENCE COMES IN EXACTLY WHICH MEASUREMENTS I ONE COULD EVEN IMAGINE TOWARD YO HOME TEST THOUH WERE NOT THERE YET MAZING I THINK UM ONE OF THE RES I COULD ASKED ABOUT IT SO MUCH AS A LOT OF PEOPLE WONDER IF THEY HAVE  D H T I DO YOU THINK THAT SOME OF THE LIFE STYLE FACTORS THAT UM INHABIT US ALL THESE DAYS COULD IN DO SAY SOME CLINICAL OR CLINICAL LIKE UM GH D H D MEANING IF I LOOK AT PEOPLE'S PHONEUSE INCLUDING MY OWN AND I DON'T THINK  OF IT LIKE A DICTION IT LOOKS TO ME AND FEELS TO ME MORE LIKE O C D AND I'LL COME CLEAN HERE BY SAYIG WHEN I WAS YOUNGER WHEN I WAS AKET I HAD A GRUNTING TIC I USED TO HIDE IT I SHUSED TO HIDE IN THE CLOSIT CAUSE OF MY DAD WOULD MAKE ME STOP AND THAT I USED TO YE I COULDN'T FEEL ANY RELIEF OF MY MIND UNTIL I IWU DO IS AN ACTUALLY NOW IF I GET VERY TIRED IF I'VE THEM PUSHING LONG HOURS IT'LL COME BACK I WAS NOT TREATED FOR IT UM BUT I WILL CONFESS THAT I'VE HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF I WAYS LIKE SPORTS WHERE I INVOLVE A LOT AT IMPACT FORTUNALLY NOT FOOTBALL BECAUSE I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WERE THE FOBALTIN WAS TERRIBLE MAYBE THT WOULD HAVE AVOIDED MORE IN FACT BUT THINGS LIKE SCAPE BOARDING BOXING THEY BRING RELIEF I FEEL CLARITY AFTER AHEAD IT WHICH I AVOID BUT UBUT I USED TO SAY THAT'S THE ONLY TIME I FEEL TRULY CLEAR FOR AND THEN EVENTUALLY IT DISSIPATED BY ABOUT AGE SIXTEEN SEVEN HINGES DISAPPEARED M SO IAVE GREAT A EMPATHY FOR THOSE THAT FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING CONTAINED IN THEM THAT WON'T ALLOW THEM TO FOCUS SOMEWHAT THEY WONT A FOCUS ON AND THESE DAYS WITH THE PHONE AND AND ALL THESE A EMALE AT CETERA I I WONDER AND I EMPATHIZE A BIT WHEN I HEAR PEOPLE SAYING LIKE I THINK I MIGHT HAVE GHD H  OR  D D DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT OUR BEHAVIORS AND OURE INTERACTION WITH THE SENSURY WORLD WHICH IS REALLY WHAT PHONES A EMALE REALLY ARE COULD IN DUCE GH D D OR REACTIVATE IT YOU I THIS IS A GREAT QUESTION I I THINK ABOUT A LOT IS N AND YE YOU MENTION THAS THIS A TICK LIKE BEHAVIOUR IN YOURSELF IT'S VERY COMMON THAT PEOPLE HAVE TAKES HAVE THIS BUILDING UP OF SOMETHING THAT CAN ONLY BE RELIEVED BY EXECUTING THE THE TACKE WHICH CAN BE MOTER MOVEMENT OR OR LOCALIZATION OR EVEN A THOUGHT AND AND PEOPLE DO I THINK THESE DAYS DO HAVE THIS IF THEY HAVEN'T CHECKE THEIR PHONEN WELL THEY DO HAVE TO BUILD UP TO BUILD UP TO BUILD UP UNTIL THEY CAN THEY CAN CHECK IT AN RELY TIT AM AND AND AND THERE'S SOME SIMILARITIES YOU KNOW THERE IS A LITTLE REWARD THAT COMES WITH THE WITHTHA THAT THE CHECKING AMBUT THE KEY QUESTION IN ALL OF PSYCHIATRY WHAT WE DO IS WE WE DON'T DIGKNOW SOMETHING UNLESS IT'S DESRUPTING WHAT WE CALL SOCIAL OR OCCUPATIONAL FUNCTIONING LIKE YOU COULD HAVE ANY NUMBER OF SYMPTOMS BUT LITERALLY EVERY EVERY PSYCHATRIC DI AGKNOWSIS REQUIRES THAT IT HAS TO BE DESRUPTING SOMEONE'S SOCIAL R OCCUPATIONAL FUNCTIONING IN THESE DAYS YOU CHECKING YOUR PHONE IS PRETTY ADAPTED THAT PRETTY MUCH HELPS YOUR SOCIAL LAND OCCUPATIONAL FUNCTIONING AND SO WE CANT WE CAN'T MAKE AND WE CAN'T MAKE IT A PSYCHATRIC IIGKNOWSIS INTERESTING AT LEAST IN THE WORLD OF TO DAY NO OPTING OUT OF COMMUNICATION NOW MAKES IT A MAKES YOU IT'S AMEWAYS LESS ADAPTOF THOU I WOULD POINT TO YOU IS AN EXAMPLE OF SOMEBODY WHO A IT'S QUITE GOOD AT MANAGING HIS A INTERACTIONS AT LEAST FROM IT FROM THE OUTSIDER PERSPECTIVE I DO ONE ASK YOU A LITTLEBIT ABOUT YOU AND UM FIRST OF ALL UM AND I REALIZE THIS IS ONLY A PARTIAL LIST BUT A YOU'RE CLENISHING YOU SEE PATIENT YOU RUN A BIG LABORATORY HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN YOUR LABORATORY NOW THAT'S A HUGE LABORATORY AM FROM EXPERIENCE I CAN SAY THAT'S THAT'S AN ENORMOUS LABORATORY UM YOU HAVE A FAMILY OF FIVE CHILDREN AND YOU'RE HAPPILY MARRIED A TI WONDERFUL COLLEAGUE OF OURS AS WELL WHO I DOES INCREDIBLE WORK UM HOW HOW DO YOU ORGANIZE THAT A KIND OF CONCEPTIAL LEVEL THE DAY AND THE WEEK UM AND I SHOULD SAY WHAT STRESS MINTIGATION PRACTICES IF ANY DO YOU INCORPORATE I'VE RECEIVED DEMAILS FROM YOU AT THREE IN THE MORNING AI SOMETIMES SEND DEMAILS AT THREE THE MORNINGBE THAT'S WHEN I WAKE UP MAYBE 'M DEPRESSED AND BUT I GO BACK TO SLEEP SO MAYBE YOU JUST DESCRIBE A THE ARK OF OF THE BLOCKS OF THE DAY NOT HOUR BY HOUR NESERRY THE DETAILS OF WHAT ARE IN THOSE BLOCKS BUT HOW DO YOU CONCEPTIALIZE THE DAY HOW DO YOU CONCEPTIALIZE THE WEEK AND HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HOW THAT'S A LINED UP WITH YOUR YOUR LARGER GOLS OF A YOU MAKING SURE THESE FIVE A YOUNG PEOPLE YOU KNOW FLOURISH WHICH I HERE THEY ARE A BUT A HW DO YOU GO ABOUT THIS WHAT FOR MOST PEOPLE WOULD JUST BE AN OVERWHELMING SET OF OF ITEMS WELL IT'S A OF COURSE A IT'S SOMETIMES IT'S JUST A TAKE IT DAY BY DAY AND AND A AND SO I I DON'T DO YU BRING THE HORIZON INTO THE UNIT OF THE DAY I I I DO I DO IT'S AT THE UNIT IS THE DAY THAT'S RIGHT AND AM WHAT I I TRY TO HAVE IN EACH DAY IS I  MENTIONARLYER SOME AT LEAST AN HOUR OF TIME WHEN I CAN THINK  AN AN THAT CAN BE IT CAN BEW WHIN KINS AR NAPPING IT CAN BE A YOU KNOW ACTUALLY BECAUSE I WHILE DRIVING I CAN DO THAT TOO I BECAUSE I AM SITTING STILL  BUT A THAT THAT'S THE ONE THING I TRY TO PRESERVE WHEN I WAS WRITING THE BOOK I ADAPTED THAT TIME TO BE MY MY WRITING TIME BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH A IT'S YOU KNOW SO I HAD TO ADD IN A NEW BLOCK OF TIME WHICH WAS SORT OF MIDNIGHT TO TO A M WRITING TIME A AND SO THAT CARVING OUT THESE EVEN SMALL PROTECTED TIMES ARE VERY IMPORTANT I THERE'S OF COURSE YOU KNOW OBLIGATIONS WILL WILL EXPAND TA FIT FILL THE TIME OF ALBAL AND YOU HAVE TO BE DISCIPLINED IN MY AT LEAST A I FOUND I HAD TO BE DISCIPLINED AND IN TRULY PROTECTING THAS A TIMES  WHERE WHERE ONE CAN THINK S THAT MEANS NOFONE THAT MEANS NOPHON NO CHECKING OF THE FON AM I I WOULD YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS WRITING THE BOOK I WOULD I WOULD HAVE A THERE'S A FOCUS MODE ON THA THA THA A MACK BOOK BUT BUT F MOVES THE BORDER AND YOU JUST TAVE YOUR YOUR YOUR DOCUMENTS AND ITS IT'S VERY PURE AND YOU DON'T HA  TEMPTATION OF OF DISTRACTION I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN BECAUSE THE VISION IN THE EYES PLACE SUCH A PROMINENT ROLL IN DIRECTING OUR COGNITION SOMETHING YOU TALK ABOUT IN THE BOOK AND AM REALLY BEAUTIFULLY IN I WITH A LOT OF DEPTH AND RIGOR A YUSING VISUAL TOOLS TO HARNESS ONES COMPLETE MENTAL ATTENTION WHEN YOU DO THIS PRACTICE OF SITTING AND JUST THINKING SITTING STILL IN THINKING YOU SAID YOUR EYES ARE OPEN A ARE YOU HEARING YOUR OWN VERBAL VOICE ALTHOUGH IN YOUR HEAD SO YOUR ACTUALLY IN CONVERSATION WITH YOURSELF GES AND AND HEARING LITTERALLY I MEAN NOT QUITE WITTE I DON'T ACTUALLY HERE A FANATION BUT I I I'M HEARING WORDS I AND SO IT'S I'M I I DISCOVERED THIS ABOUT MYSELF OTHER PEOPLE  I THINK YOU NOW LY OPERATE I DIFFERENTLY BUT I'M EXTREMELY VERBAL AND HOW I THINK THAT'S HOW ALL MY REASONING AS DONE ITS WITH SENENCEES AND CONSTRUCTION OF OF A YOU ALMOST OCQUASIONS WITH WORDS E COMPLETE SENTENCES  COMPLETE SENSES OR COMPLETISH ANYWAY A MOSTLY COMPLETE AND THEN AND WHEN WRITING THE BOOK EVERYTHING ABOUT THE WRITING I WOULD ALWAYS EVERY SENTENCE WAS ALWAYS PLAYED OUT IN MY MIND LISTENING FOR FOR RHYTHEM IN TIMING AND AND AND I WOULD OBSESS OVER EXACT PLACEMEN OF OF WORDS TO GET THE WRIT RHYTHM OF THE SPOKEN SENTENCE IN MY MY MIND COULD I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT YOUR FLOW BUT WHEN YOU DO THAT AND HAVING EXPERIENCED THIS PROCESS OF BIT ALTHOUGH DIFFERENTLY DO YOU EXPERIENCE ANY KIND OF WELLING UP A OF ANXIETY WHEN YOUR HITTING THE THE FRICTION POINTS M AND IF SO DO YOU HAVE TOOLS OR A WAYS THAT YOU QUELL THAT ANXIETY IN REAL TIME CAUSE WHAT WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE IS A YOUR MIND BUT WHAT WERE REALLY TELLING ABOUT IS THIS PROCESS OF OF CONVERTING THE ACTIVITY OF NURONS IN TO SOMETHING PHYSICALLY CONCRETE IN THE WORLD AND THESE INTERMEDIATE STEPS ARE SO MYSTERIOUS TO EVERYBODY WE HEAR YOU KNOW JUST RITE THE BOOK JUST DO IT WHAT WHATEVER THAT MEANS IN FACT THA STATEMENTS LIKE THAT TO MERE COND OF EMPTY AND MEANING LESS AM BUT WHEN YOU HEAR YOUR VOICE AND YOUR TRYING TO FIND THE CORRECT WORD AND YOUR KEEP HITTING IT DOESN'T SOUND QUITE RIGHT WHAT IS THE EXPERIENCE IN YOUR MODY YE I IT WHEN IT'S NOT RIGHT IT'S DEATHONALY I IT ITS IT'S AVERSIS I DOESN'T FEEL GOOD AM BUT IT'S NOT I'M BUT I BUT THERE'S ALSO  HOPE BECAUSE I KNOW I CAN SOLVE IT TO AND AND SO THERE'S THERE'S THIS A IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOUR YOU'RE ALMOST THERE AN NOW YOU'VE THERE'S A A PATH THAT YOU KNOW AS THERE YOU DON'T QUITE SEE IT BUT IT'S THERE AND AND I I KEEP THAT IN MIND AND SOTHERS THERE'S A THERE'S A THERE'S IS A PREPULSIVE FORCE FORWARD I BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE SOLUTION IS THERE AND AND THATS SAID I NOW THERE WERE THERE WERE SINGLE WORDS THAT WOULD OCCUP I WOULD STENDDAYS  YOU BECAUSE I WAS JUST NOT HAPPY ANTIL I GOT IT RIGHT AND THERE WERE SOMETHINGS THAT I NEVER QUITE GOT PERFECT AND SO I LEFT OUT OF THE BOOK ENTIRELY BECAUSE IT WAS SO CLOSE BUT NOT NOT QUITE THERE AND SOI AN AS IE NOW I CAN'T PTTHAT IN EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID IS ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH MY EXPERIENCE OF YOU AND THE WAY YOU GO ABOUT A EVERYTHING I AFT ASK ARE ARE YOUR KID'S WRITERS DID THEY LIKE BOOKS IN WORDS AND AND POETRY I I KNOW ONE OF YOUR CHILDREN IS GOING ON TO A CREER IN MEDICINE IN SCIENCE YE THE THERE EACH DIFFERENT WHICH IS AMAZING YET THEY ALL I THINK TO HAVE SOME APPRECIATION ORAR A LOT OF APPRECIATION FOR FOR FOR READING AM BUT SOME ARE VERY MUSICAL TO O THE I'VE ARE EXTREMELY MUSICAL VERY VERY TALENTED WITH GETAR AND SING AND AND VOCAL YOU KNOW IMPRESSIONS I JUST ASTONISHING AND AND SOME OF THEM ARE R GREAT WITH DRAWING AND AND ARTISTRY AND AND SOME ARE VERY PHYSICAL AND VIGOROUS AND AND ARE NEVER I HAPPY EXCEPT WHEN YOU WEEPING ABOUT AND SO IT'S IT'S JUST ANAZING HOW DIFFERENT THEY ARE LESTLY BUT I THINK THERE IS AA SHARED APPRECIATION FOR FOR LANGUAGE DO YOU THINK THE A THAT ONE CAN TRAIN THEIR MIND IN USING THESE PRACTICES I I REALLY LIKE YOUR DESCRIPTION OF THE AM SITTING STAYING PHYSICALLY STILL AND AND LEARNING TO GRAPPLE WITH THOS THOSE CHALLENGES IT SOMETHING THAT SPECILLY IN LABORATORY SCIENCE WE ARE REALLY TRAIN TO DO I'M LIKE MANY PROFESSIONS WERE TAUGHT TO COME IN AND JUST GET INTO MOTION AND AND I FOUND THAT VERY RELAXING IND SOME ON WHO PROUBLY HAS AN UNDERLING A TAKE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT FELL GRAT TO BE IN MOTION WHERE THE HARDEST THINGS ABOUT BECOMING A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR AND RUNNING ALAD WAS THAT I NO LONGER WORKING WITH MY HANDS AND IT IT FELT LIKE I WAS I IT WOUD FELT LIKE A SOME BIG IMPORTANT PART OF MY LIFE HAD BEEN AMPUTATED BUT WHAT SORTS OF PRACTIC IS DO YU INCORPORATE THERE AND YOU THINK UM PEOPLE CAN LEARN TO GET BETTER AT FOCASING THROUGH A DEDICATED PRACTICE OF THE SORT THAT YOU DESCRIE I THINK OKNOW I ALSO YOU NIGHT I I REMEMBER THE RHYTHMS OF OF PHYSICAL WORK IN LABORATORY VERY WELL LIKE I A MY WORK A YOU KNOW THESE DAYS IS AS AS THE LABORATORY LEADER MY JOB HAS RETURND MOSTLY TO WORDS NOW AGAIN AND AND SO IT'S ITS KIND OF COMING FUL CIRCLE I WAS A A I  IT SETS A DIFFERENT MODE I THINK YOU JUST HAVE TO EMBRACE THE THAT DIFFERENT STAGES OF LIFE COME WITH WITH DIFFERENT MOTES BUT YOU CAN DEFTINALLY TRAIN YOURSELF FOR EACH MODE I WAS NOT A YOU KNOW I I I LOVED O THE AS I MENTIONED ATHA THE RHYTHM OF OF SEWING AN AN IN SUITURING N INSURGERY A AND I WORKED REALLY HARD ON THAT AND BECAME YOU KNOW GOOD AT IT AND NOW I I NEVER DO IT A BUT IT'S WHAT'S THE NEXT CHALLENGE YOU NOTHERS ALL THE VARIOUS EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES THE DISSECTIONS OF THE BRAINS YOON I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF BRAIN TO SECTIONS I'VE DONE IN MY LIFE NOW I DON'T DO THEM AT ALL AND THEN YOU DEVELOPED TE METHODS O THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO THE SETRAN I SHOUL MENTION IT MAYBE TELL US FOR A MOMENT ABOUT CLARITY AN FOR THE FOR UM PEOPLE WHO WILL PROBABLY NEVER SET FOOT INTO A LABORATORY UM WHAT AN INCREDIBLE YET ANOTHER INCREDIBLE DISCOVER DISCOVERY IN DEVELOPMENT CLARITY IS A AND WHY IT HELPS US UNDERSTAND HOW THE BRAIN AN STRUCTURE YES SO THIS IS THIS IS A DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY ALSO DEVELOPED IN IN MY LAB HERE AND ITS A A PART OF A BROADER APPROACH THAT WE CALL HYDROGELL TISSUE CHEMISTRY AND WHAT THIS IS IS ITS BUILDING A JELL LIKE A CLEAR JELLOW LIKE A SUBSTANCE WITH FROM WITHIN ALL THE CELLS OF A TISSUE A OR EVENEN ANIMAL ALL AT ONCE SEE YOUR BUILDING A EFFECTUALLY BUILDING A JELL INSIDE ALL THE CELLS AT ONCE NOW THAT'S A ODD THING TO DO A WHY DO WE DO IT WHILE WE DO IT A TO TRANSFORM THE TISSUE INTO A MORE TRACTABLE ACCESSIBLE A OBJECT AND THE REASON THAT WORKS IS WE HAVING BUILT THIS JELL THIS NEW INFER STRUCTURE INSIDE THE TISSUE WE CAN THEN USE CHENICAL TRICKS AND WE CAN LINK THE MOLCULES WE CARE ABOUT LIKE PROTEENES OR ARE ANAS WHICH ARE THE THINGS AS YOU KNOW RIGT FOR THEY BECOME PROTINES WE CAN LINK THEM PHYSICALLY ANCHOR THEM TO THIS JELL WHICH IS A SCAFFOLD BASILLY ITS AN INTERLOCKING NET WORK OF OF POLIMERS WE CAN LINK ALL THESE INTERESTING MOLCULES IN PLACE LOCK THEM IND WHERE THEY WERE INITIALLY IN THE TISSUE IN THE CELL IN ALL THE CELLS AND THEN WE CAN REMOVE VERY VI COROUSLY EVERYTHING WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT'S BLOCKING RE LIGHT THAT'S BLOCKING OUR MOLECULES COMING IN TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION WITH THE TISSUE WE CAN GET RID OF EVERYTHING ELSE LIKE THE LIPIDS THE FACTS WE CAN EFFECTVLY USE DE TURGENCS TOTO GET THEM ALL OUT AND THEN WE CAN SEE IN ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE ABSORBING OUR SCATTERING LIGHT ARE GONE YOU CANNOT OF BRAIN THAT'S COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT AND YET ALL THE INTERESTING MOLECULES ARE STILL LOCKED IN TO PLACE THERE AT THE CELULAR AND SUBSOLRE LITTLE AND SO THIS IS HYDROGALETISSUE CHAMISTRY THE FIRST FORM WE DESCRIBED WAS CALLED CLARITY I WE USE THAT A QUITE A BIT STILL BUT THERE MANY VARIANCE NOW THAT WE AND OTHERS HAVE DEVELOPED ON THI PACE I A CONCEPT OF BUILDING THIS JELL THAN THE TISSUEMAN ANCHORING MOLECULES INTO PLACE LITERALLY GLASS CLEAR BRAINS I'VE DONE THIS I'VE TAKEIN OF BRAIN CLEARE WITH THIS METHOD AND LOOKED AT SOMEBODY THROUGH IT AND THOG DON'T WANT TO GET IT TOO CLUSTER I DON'T TOUCH IT TO YOUR OWN I BUT A AND YOU CAN SEE DIRECT ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT OM THAT'S INCREDIBLE FOR TH IT RAISES AN IMPORTANT QUESTION WHICH IS AAGAIN ABOUT THE HUMAN BRAIN AND NOW SOMEBODY WHO ESSENTUALLY START OUT IN NOR ANATAMY AND THEN GOT INTO OTHER THINGS I I ALWAYS AM OM BOTHERED BY THE FACT THAT WE ACTUALLY KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE MICRO STRUCTURE OF THE HUMAN BRAIN COMPARED TO THE BRAINS OF OTHER ORGANISMS AND IN THINKING ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THE CIRCUITRY AND THE THE PIANO SO TO SPEAK THAT AND HOW TO MANIPULATED IN ORDER TO COM RELIEF SUFFERING ONE WONDERS ARE THE STRUCTURES IN THESE ANIMAL BRAINS AAND HOW THEY BEHAVE AN ACTIVE COPING PASSIVE COPING A D D ET CETERA THOSE MODELS HOW WELL THEY TRAINSLATE TO THE HUMAN CONDITION DO YOU THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THERE ARE ENTIRE REGIONS OF THE HUMAN BRAIN THAT AREN'T JUST BIGGER BUT THAT EXIST ONLY IN THE BRAINS OF HUMANS ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT WE HAVE THIS SPEECH ALTHOUGH I DO WONDER SOMETIMES IF YOU KNOW ANIMALS WERE REPORTING TO EACH OTHER THERE MAY DO THEY HAVE LITTLE PSYCHEATRIC SESSIONS WITH ONE ANOTHER NOI II'M ALWAYS CAREFUL TO NOT A ASSUME WE DO THINGS BETTER OW WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE DOING BETTER THAN WE UNDERSTAND WHAT ANIMALS ARE DOING AND THEY CERTAINLY DO THINGS BETTER THAN THAN WE DO THAT' SAID WE DO HAVE AMAZING WONDERFUL BRAINS AND MANY STRUCTURES THAT ARE VERY HIGHLY DEVELOPED IN OUR BRAINS THAT ARE AR ARE NOT NEARLY SO DEVELOPED IN MICE AND  AND FISH FOR EXAMPLE NOW IM THAT'S SAID WHEN I LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS THE MAMALIAN BRAIN REALLY DOING THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT WE COULD STUDY IN IN ANIMALS AND EN LABORATORY EMANIMALS LIKE MICE A THAT IT TURNS OUT YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY I AND AND SO I WOULD NEVER DRAW THE LINS AY HEAR SOMETHING YOU CAN'T STUDY IN MICE OR HERE SOMETHING THAT HAS NO PARALLEL AND MI I WOULD BE VERY CAREFUL BEFORE MAKING ANY ANY STATEMENT LIKE THAT A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT AS W E'VE BEEN ABLE TO STUDY JUST IN THE PAST YEAR COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF DISSOCIATION AND BOTH WE HAD A PAPER THAT CAME OUT IN LATE TWENTY TWENTY BOTH MOUSE AND HUMAN WORK IN WHICH WE GOT TO THE SORT OF THE CIRCUIT BASIS FOR DISSOCIATION WOULD NOW WHAT IS DISSOCIATION IT LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT NOT HAVE EXPERIENCED IT BUT IT'S ACTUALLY VERY COMMON MORE THAN SEVENTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO BEEN THROUGH TRAMA EXPERIENCED DISSOCIATION IT SHOWS UP IN BORDELINE PERSONALITY SHOWS UP IN PITIAST WHAT IT IS ITS IS A SEPARATION OF THE SENSE OF SELF FROM THE BODY ANCSE YOU CAN HAVE SOME ONE WHO IT'S NOT AS IF YOU'RE NUM YOU'RE NOT ANESTETIZED YOU CAN STILL YOU KNOW THAT SOMETHING'S HAPPENING TO THE BODY BUT YOU YOU JUST DON'T CARE BECAUSE YOU DON'T ASCRIBE IT TO YOURSELF WHICH IS VERY INTERESTING WRIGHT THAT IS HOW INTERESTING AS THAT A SUCHA REPORT NARRATIVE YE ALMOST A IN YOUR BOOK YOU TOUCH ON THIS U AN I I WILL SAY IS THE MOST A PRECISE AND MEANING FUL AND ELOQUENT DESCRIPTION OF WHAT MIGHT BE CONSCIOUSNESS THIS THIS NARRATIVE TOWARD THE SELF OR OF THE SELF AND WHERE IT MIGHT RESIDE SO INDISSOCIIVE CONDITIONS U PEOPLE ART OUR FEELING AS COND OF AND ABSENCE OF EMERGE BETWEEN MIND AND BODY OR IS THAT ONE WE  OUR S RIIN AND AS I RECALL THIS PAPER INVOLVED A AN EXPLORATION OF CEDEMIE CANMING WAS A BIG PART OF IT YET THAT'S RIGHT AND SO CEDEMIN AS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE CASES WHERE PEOPLE CAN EXPERIENCED DISSOCIATION A CEDMENE OR PIEC P WE CALL THESE THE DISSOCIATIVE A DRUGS THEY CAUSE IT JUST LIKE A THESE THESE OTHER SYCATRIC AA CONDITIONS CAN CAUSE IT AND SO WE BUT WE WERE ABLE TO MANIFES THIS IN IN MICE ADMINISTERING THESE DISSOCIATIVE AGENTS IN MICE WE COULD MAKE THEM STILL ABLE TO DETECT STIMULUS BUT NOT CARE THAT IT WAS WAS HAPPENING ALL THE WHILE WE WERE RECORDING ITHE ACTIVITY OF INDIVIDUAL CELLS IN THE BRAIN TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON WHAT WHAT WAS HAPPENING ALONG WITH THIS DISSOCIATION AND THEN YOUSE OPT ED GENETICS TO SEE THAT IT MATTERED TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE THAT PATTERN OF ACTIVITY AND S O THAT ACTUALLY CAUSES THE DISSOCIATION SO WE COULD DO ALL THAT IN MICE A WHICH WHICH WAS  NO AAT  JUST A WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THAT YOU COULD STUDY SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN MICE AND WE ARE ABLE TO GO BACK AND FORTH WITH A HUMAN A WORK BECAUSE HERE AT IN OUR STANFORD COMPREHENSIVE EPILEPSY CENTERE THERE ARE AS A LOT OF WHAT WE CALL STERIO E E G RECORDING PATIENCE WHO COME IN AND IN THE COURSE OF NORMAL CLINICAL CARE THEY HAVE ELECTRAS RECORDING IN THEIR BRAING TO DIDENTIFY WHERE THE SEIZURE IS SO THEY CAN A BHE CANDIDATES FOR REMOVING A LITTLE PATCH OF THE BRAIN THAT'S CAUSING THE SEASURE THIS IS DONE FOR PATIONS WO MEDICATIONS ARE NOT HELPING THEIR SEIZURE DISORDER AND THERE WAS A AA PATIENT WOU HAD A DISSOCIATIVE STATE BEFORE EVERY SEISURE SOASAS A HUMAN BEING WHO WAS REALLY DISSOCIATING WHO COULD TELL US LITERALLY AS IT WAS HAPPENING AND WE COULD SEE THIS PATTERN THE SAME PATTERN THAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE MICE IN THE SAME PATCH OF THE BRAIN WE COULD SEE THAT HAPPENING IN THE HUMAN BEING AT EXACTLY THE RIGHT TIME IN THE SAME PATCH OF THE BRAIN THAT'S HOMOLOGOUS ACROSS THESE IMMENSE EVOLUTIONARY DISTANCES AND WE KNEW THAT IT MATTER TO BOTH IN MOUSING HUMAN BECAUSE IN THE HUMAN WE COULD CAUSEN'T TO HAPPEN SAND I JUST ONT TO UNDERSCORE THE POWER OF NOT JUST A THAT I WONT T UNDERSCORE THE POWER OF OF OPDIGENETICS AND THE ABILITY TO NOT JUST REMOVE AR PARTICULAR EXPERIENCE OR BEHAVIOR BY LEISONING OR DESTROYING BUT THEN TO GO BACK AND AND ACTUALLY ACTIVATE THE SAME STRUCTURE OR GROUP OF STRUCTURES AND SEE THE EMERGENCE SO IT'S ESSENTIALLY AT THESE DAYS YOU HEAR A LOT ABOUT GAIN OF FUNCTION RESEARCTION THE CONTECTS OF VIRALMANIPULATION BUT GAIN OF FUNCTION IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO IN THE LABORATORY AND AND AND A YOU DO IN PATIENCE TO BOTH TAKE AWAY SOMETHING AND PUT IT BACK AND WHICH GIVES YOU CAUSALITY CONCERING AND SO AN EXACTLY AND SO WITHOUP PROGETICS WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE I IN ANIMALS WITHOUT BEING ON ANY ANY CADEMEN OR ANY ANY DRAGON WE COULD CAUSE THE DISSOCI STATE BY PLAYING IN A PRECISE PATTERN OF ACTIVITY AND NOT WHO WAS A THOUGHT YOU COULD DO THAT BUT THERE'S A A COMBINE MOUSING HUMAN PAPER LIKEWISE LIKEWISE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PLAY IN A A YOU KNOW VISUAL SENSATIONS INTO THE BRAINS OF OF MICE A AND I OBSERVING WHICH SELLS AND E VISUAL PART OF THE BRAIN VISUAL CARTEXS ARE NATURALLY RESPONSIVE TO FOR EXAMPLE VERTICAL BARS INSTEAD OF HORIZONTAL BARS IN THE VISUAL WORLD WE COULD SEE WHICH SELLS WERE NORMALLY RECORDING ON VERTICAL BARS AND THEN WE COULD USE OPTOGENETICS TO COME AND PLAY IN ACTIVITY JUST THOSE SELLS TO THESE ANIMALS ARE NOT VIEWING ANYTHOT DOING ANYTHING AT ALL AND WE COULD ACTIVE A JUST THE VERTICAL BARSELVES AND NOT ONLY DO THE ANIMAL ACT AS IF IT WAS SEEING VERTICAL BAR BEHAVIORLY IT WAS TRAINED TO DO A PARTICULAR THING IF IT SO VERTICAL BAR IN I DID THAT JUST AS IF IT WAS SEEING SOMETHING VISUALLY BUT EVERYTHING IN THE BRAIN THAT WE RECORDING TOO THE INTERNAL REPRESENTATION OF THIS EXTERNAL WORLD WAS NATURALISTIC TO IT LOOKED LIKE THE THE BRAIN WAS SEEING SOMETHING VISUAL SO THAT WANOTHER THAT'S GAIN OF FUNCTION TOO AN O PLAYING IN PROVIDING A COMPLEX SENSATION OR PERCEPT THAT WASN'T THERE BEFORE AND WE CAN DO THAT IN AYOU KNOW A CROSS SPECIES SO I I WE HAVEN'T YOU KNOW AND OF COURSE MICE AR SOCIAL AND AND THEY DO THEY DO AMAZING ACTS OF INFORMATION PROSSESSYNG AND AND SO I'M I DON'T A I TRY NOT TO DISPARAGE ORE OUR COUSINS AND TOO MUCH WE CERTAINLY HAVE HELPED THE FIELD OF NARROWSIDES AN MEDISINE I SHOULD MENTION AND I KNOW THAT PEOPLE HAVE VERY SENSITIVITIES ABOUT ANIMAL R SEARCH BUT THE WORK THAT'S BEEN CARRIED OUT IN MY SAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY ON VITAL AND INSTRUCTIONAL FOR FOR TREATMENT OF HUMAN DISEASE SINCE WE TALKED ABOUT A DISSOCIATION AN DESSOCIATIVE A STATES RATHER AND CANNEMEINE I'D LOVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON  PSYCHODELIC MEDICINE YOU KNOW I A SORT OF HALF JOKE HAVING GROWN UP IN THIS AREAN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHEN WHOS MUCH MORE COUNT OR CULTURE THAN IT IS NOW A THAT MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WERE HEARING ABOUT NOW A AT LEAST FROM MY READ OF THE OF THE HISTORY BOOKS HAPPENED BEFORE THERE WAS A MOVEMENT A AIMED AT TAKING THE VERY SAME COMPOUNDS ESSENTIALLY PUTTING THEM INTO PATIENCE OR PEOPLE WERE OBVIOUSLY USING THEM RECREATIONALLY BUT PUTTING THEM INTO PATIENCE AND SEEING TREMENDOUS POSIVE EFFECTS BUT ALSO A TREMENDOUS EXAMPLES OF A INDUE PSYCHIATRIC ILLNESS INOTHER WORDS MANY PEOPLE LOST THEIR MINDS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF OVER USE OF PSYCHODOCS APROBLY LOSE A FEW A PEOPLE OUT THERE  BUT I DO ONE A TALK ABOUT WHAT IS THE STATE OF THESE COMPOUNDS AND I REALIZE ATS A HUGE CATEGORY OF COMPOUNDS BUT ELESTYIN SO SIVAN AS I UNDERSTAND TRIGGER ACTIVATION OF PARTICULAR SERITONE AND RECEPTOR MECHANISMS MAY OR MAY NOT LEAD TO MORE WIDESPREAD ACTAVATION OF THE BRAIN MOR THAT ONE WOULD SEE OTHERWISE BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL LITERATURE BUT WHAT IS YOUR SOR F TOP CONTOUR SENSE OF HOW EFFECT OVE THESE TOOLS ARE GOING TO BE FOR TREATING DEPRESSION AND THEN IF WE HAVE THE TIME WE COULD TALK ABOUT TROMAN EMDYA MAIN SOME OF THAT ORDER WELL YOUR YOUR RIGHT TO HIGHLAY BOTH THE OPPORTUNITY AND AND THE PERIL THAT IS THERE HA AND OF COURSE WE WANT TO HELP PATIENTS AND OF COURSE WE WANT TO TO EXPLORE ANYTHING THAT MIGHT A BE BE HELPFUL IN BUT WE WANT TO DO IN A SAFE IN IN RIGOROUS WAY BUT I I DO THINK WE SHOULD EXPLORE THESE THESE HAVE NES THESE ARE A AGENTS THAT ALTER REALITY AND ALTER THE EXPERIENCE OF REALITY I SHOULD SAY IN IN RELATIVELY PRECISE WAYS THEY THEY DO HAVE PROBLEMS THEY CAN BE ADDICTID THEY CAN CAUSE LASTING CHANGE THAT IS NOT DESIRABLE A BUT WE HAVE TO SEE THESE IS OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE TOAFIRST OF ALL STUDY IN THE LABORATORY AND I'M DOING THIS A HERE I OWI WE HAVE BIG A WE HAVE SAFES WITH MANY INTERESTING PSYCHODELICS THAT ARE VERY CAREFULLY REGULATED WE GET INSPECTIONS FROM THE THE AND SO  ANY ONE'S HOPEN TO FIND THESE LA  EXISTIN OUTER SPACE TA NEED A TO PON BOARD ONE OF THE NONE OF THE SPACE ECS AND MISSIONS IN ORDER ACSES TOMS O DON'T TRY AND COM BEHIND THE NOT LECTS EXECTRYTURA AND AND A AND AND WERE DOING EXACTLY THIS FOR WERE SAYING THIS IS AND CREBALE OPPORTUNET IF WE COULD UNDERSTAND HOW YOU KNOW THE PERCEPTION OF REALITY IS ALTER WE COULD BE CREATE NEW KINDS OF INTERVENTION THAT DON'T HAVE THE  RISKS AN AN AN AN THE THE PROBLEMS OF OF CAUSING LASTING CHANGE OR OR ADDICTION NOW THAT SAID A EVEN AS THESE MEDICATIONS EXIST NOW AS YOU KNOW THERE'S AN IMPULSE TO TO USE THEM AND VERY SMALL DOSS ANTIES HAND AS AGUNT TO A TREATMENTS FOR FOR THER BE VERIOUS KINDS AND I I AM ALSO SUPPORTIVE OF THAT IF A YOU NON CAREF IN INRIGOROUSLY OF COURSE THERE'S RISK BUT THEREIS RISK WITH MANY OTHER KINDS OF OF TREATMENT AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THE RISKS A FOR THESE A MEDICATIONS A VASTLY OUTWAY THE RISKS THAT WE NORMALLY TOLERATE AN OTHER BRANCHEUS OF MENISON WHY WOULD THEY WORK I MEAN THE A YOU KNOW LET SAY A THAT INDEED THEIR MAIN EFFACT IS TO CREATE MORE A MORE CONICTIVITY AT LEAST IT IN THE IN THE MOMENT  BETWEEN BRAINARRY SO A THE WAY I THINK ABOUT A VERY A I THINK ABOUT THE TWO EXTREMES OF OF MY EXPERIENCE ANYWAYS A A HIGH DEGREE OF TRASS AND FOCUS FOR WHATEVER REASON IS GOING TO MAKE CREATE CHANGES IN MY VISUAL FIELD AND CHANGES IN THE WAY THAT I PERCEIVED TIMES THAT EN A MICROSLICE TIME I MIGH IN A VERY CONTRACTED VIEW OF WHATEVER MY EXPERIENCES RES ON THE OPPOSITE EXTREME IN A IN A DREAM OR IN SLEEP SPACE AN TIME AR VERY FLUID AND I'M ESENTIALLY RELAXED ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT BE A VERY INTERESTING DREAM INT MIGHT NOT BE A PSYCHODELIC SEEM TO BE A A TROJECTORY A NOT AF TOO FAR OFF FROM THE DREAM STATE WHERE SPACE IN TIME OR ESSENTIALLY NOT AS RIGID AND THERE IS THIS ELEMENT OF SINECEGE OF BLENDING OF THE SENSES A YOU KNOW FEELING COLORS AND A HEARING A LIGHT AN THINKS OF THAT SORT IT YOU HEAR THESE REPORTS ANYWAY A WHY WOULD HAVING THAT DREAM LIKE EXPERIENCE SOMEHOW RELIEVED DEPRESSION LONG TERM ISI ISWE HAVE ANY IDEA WHY THAT MIGHT BE I A WE HAVE SOME IDEAS AND NO NO DEEP UNDERSTANDING A ONE WAY I I THINK ABOUTHE PSYCHODELICSIS THEY A INCREASE ARE WILLINGNESS TO ART THEY INCREASED AMONG US OF OUR BRAIN TO ACCEPT UNLIKELY A WAYS OF CONSTRUCTING THE WORLD UNLIKELY HYPOTHESES AS IT WERE AS TO WHAT'S GOING ON THE BRAIN IN PARTICULAR QUARTZECTS I THINK IS A HYPOTHESIS GENERATION AND TESTING MACHINE IT'S COMING UP WITH MODELS ABOUT EVERYTHING IT'S GOT ALL OF BITS OF DATA COMING AND AND IT'S MAKING MODELS AND UPSDATING THE MODELS AND CHANGING THEM THEORIES HYPOTHESES FOR WHAT'S GOING ON AND SOME OF THOSE NEVER REACH OUR CONSCIOUS MIND AND THISS SOMETHING I TALK ABOUT IN PROJECTIONS IN THE IN THE BOOK A A QUITE A BIT IS MANY OF THESE ARE FILTERED OUT BEFORE THEY GET TO OUR OUR CONSCIOUS MIND AND THAT'S GOOD WEWE WE THINK HOW DISTRACTED WE BE IF WE WERE CONSTANTLY HAVING TO VALUEAT ALL THESE E KNOW HYPOTHESES ABOUT WE KNOW WHAT KINDS OF SHAPES OR OJECTS OR POTHESES WERE OUT THERE AND SO LON OF THISIS IS HANDLED A A BEFORE IT GETS TO CONSCIOUSNESS WHAT THE PSYCHODELICS SEEM TO DO IS THEY CHANGE THE A THRESHOLD FOR US TO BECOME AWARE OF THESE INCOMPLETE HYPOTHESES AR WRONG HYPOTHESES OR OR CONCEPTS THAT MIGHT BE NOISE A BUT ARE JUST WRONG ANDS ARE NEVER ALLOWED TO GET INTO OUR OR CONSCIOUS MIND NOW AN THAT THAT'S PRETTY INTERESTING AND IT GOES WRONG AND PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS I THINK A IN IN SGETS A FRANIA OF SOME THETIMES THE PARANOID A A DELUSIONS THAT PEOPLE HAVE ARE EXAMPLES OF THESE A FOR MODELS THAT ESCAPE INTO THE CONSCIOUS MIND AND BECOME A ACCEPTED AS REALITY AND THEY NEVER SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN OUT THERE NOW HOW COULD SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN THE RIGHT WAY HELP WITH SOMETHING LIKE DEPRESSION PATIENCE WITH DEPRESSION OFTEN ARE A ARE STUCK THEY THEY CAN'T A ALOOK INTO THE FUTURE WORLD OF POSSIBILITIES AS EFFECTIVELY THERS EVERYTHING SEEMS  HOPELESS AND WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN THEY THEY DISCOUNT THE VALUE OF THEIR OWN ACTION THEY DISCOUNT THE VALUE OF THE WORLD AT GIVING RISE TO A FUTURE THAT MATTERS EVERYTHING SEEMS TO RUN OUT LIKE A RIVER JUST RUNNING OUT INTO A DESERT IND DRYING UP AND WHAT THESE AGENTS MAY DO THAT INCREASE THE THE THE FLOW THROUGH CIRCUITRY IF YOU WILL THE PERCULATION OF ACTIVITY THROUGH CIRCUITRY MAY AND UP DOING FOR DEPRESSION IS INCREASING THE THE TH ESCAPE OF SOME SOME TENDRILS OF OF OF PROCESS OF OF FORWARD PROGRESSION THROUGH THROUGH THE WORLD A THAT'S A CONCEPT IT'S HOW I THINK ABOUT IT THERE ARE WAYS WE CAN MAKE THAT RIGOROUS WE WE CAN INDEED IDENTIFY IN THE BRAIN BY RECORDING WE CAN SEA CELLS THAT REPRESENT STEPS ALONG A PATH AND LOOK INTO THE FUTURE AND WE CAN RIGOROUSLY DEFINE THESE SELLS AND WE CAN SEE IF THESE ARE ALTERED ON PSYCHODOLICS AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WEARE A WORKING WITH THESE AGENTS IN T LABORATORY TO SAY ART ISITS REALLY THE CASE ARE THESE OPENING UP NEW PATHS OR OR REPRESENTATIONS OF PATHS INTO THE FUTURE A EMDY AM MAY TA ECSTASY IS A UNIQUE COMPOUND IN THAT IT LEADS TO BIG INCREASES IN BRAIN LEVELS OF DOPOMEAN END CERETONEAN SIMULTANEOUSLY AND I REALIZE THAT THE NURMOTULATORS LIKE DOPIMEN CERETONAN OFTEN WORK IN CONCERT NOT ALONE THE WAY THERE COMMONLY DESCRIBED IN THE A YOU OTHE MORE GENERAL POPULAR DISCUSSIONS HOWEVER A IT IS A UNIQUE COMPOUND AND IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE CERETONERGEI COMPOUNDS LIKE ELESTY AN SILISIBIN AND THERE ARE NOW DATA A STILL EMERGING THAT IT MIGHT BE IN ENIN SOME CASES CAN BE USEFUL FOR THE TREATMENT OF TRAMA PETIOUSTYAN AND SIMILAR THINGS WHY WHY WOULD THAT WORK AND DO YOUTH AND A LARGER QUESTION PERHAPS THE MORE IMPORTANT QUESTION IS PSYCHIDELICS EMDIA MAY ELES TO ALL THOSE COMPOUNDS THERE TO IN MY MIND THEI'RE TOO COMPONENTS THERE'S THE EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE WHILE YOUR ON THEM AND THEN THERES THE EFFECT THEY HAVE AFTER PEOPLE ARE GENERATING VARIATIONS O THESE COMPOUNDS THAT ARE NON HOLLUCINATORY VARIATIONS BUT HOW CRUCIAL DO YOU THINK IT IS TO HAVE LET'S STAY WITH THEM DO YOU MAD THE EXPERIENCE OF HUGE LEVELS OF DOPE ME IN HUGE LEVELS OF SERATONE AND A TYPICAL LEVELS OF DOPENIENCE EIRTONE RELEASED HAVING TIS HIGHLY ABNORMAL EXPERIENCE IN ORDER TO BE NORMAL AGAIN I THINK THE BRAIN LEARNS FROM THOSE EXPERIENCES THAT'S THAT'S THE WAY I SEE IT AND AND SO FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE ON WHOAVE TAKEN IM TO IN AY THEY WILL AS YOU SAY TOL A THER' THEY BE THE ACUTE PHASE OF BEING ON THA THE THE DRUG AND EXPERIENCING THETHIS EXTREME CONNECTEDNESS WITH OTHER PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE AND THEN THE THE DRUG I WEAREIS OFF AND BUT THE BRAIN LEARNED FROM THAT EXPERIENCE AND SO WHAT WHAT PEOPLE WILL REPORT IS YOU I'M NOT  NOT IN THAT STATE BUT I SAW WHAT WAS POSSIBLE YOU NOW I SAW YET YOU CAN  DON'T NEED TO BE BARRIERS ARE AT LEAST NOT AS MANY BARRIERS IS AS I THOUGHT I CAN CONNECT WITH MORE PEOPLE IN IN A WAY THAT THAT IS HELFUL AND SO I THINK IT'S THE LEARNING THAT HAPPENS IN THAT STATE THAT ACTUALLY A MATTERS AND THIS AS YOU DESCRIBE THAT THAT SOUNDS A LOT LIKE WHAT I UNDERSTAND TO BE THE HALL MARKED FEATURE OF REALLY GOOD PSYCHOANALYSIS THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PATIENT AND THERAPIST HOPEFULLY EVOLVES TO THE POINT WHERE A A THESE KINDS OF TEST CAN BE RUN WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THAT RELATIONSHIP AND THEN EXPORTED YET TO OTHER RELATIO IS THAT EXACTLY AND TAN THAT PROBABLY AMASSUMING IS STILL THE GOAL OF REALLY GOOD PSYCHIATRY ALSO IT'S A PART OF A INTIMACY REALLY  IT SHOULD BE I WHEN WE HAVE TIME I THINK ALL ALL GOOD PSYCHIATRUST TRYD TO ACHIEF AT THAT LEVEL OF OF OF CONNECTION IN LEARNING I TRY TO HELP PATIENCE A CREAT A KNEW A NEW MODEL THAT IS STABLE THAT IS LEARNED AND THAT CAN  HELP INSTRUCT FUTURE BEHAVIOUR ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I AM TOOK FROM READING YOUR BOOK INDITION TO A LEARNING SO MUCH SCIENCE AND THE FUTURE OF PSYCHAATRY AND BRAIN SCIENCE WAS A YOU KNOW AMIDST THESE VER MAN I MAKE IS VERY TRAGIC CASES AND AND SADNESS AND A LOT OF THE THE A THE WEIGHT THAT THAT PUTS ON THE CLINITION ON YOU ALSO THAT THERE'S A THAT THERE'S A SENTIAL CHORD OF ABOPTIMISM THAT WERE WERE HEADED IS A NOT JUST A POSSIBLE BUT VERY LIKELY AND EN BETTER AND AM YOU KNOW IT ARE YOU AN OPTIMIST I AM AND THIS THIS IS BY THE WAY THIS WAS OF REALLY INTERESTING EXPERIENCE IN WRITING PROJECTIONS BECAUSE I HAD A A A DUEL GO I WANTED IT TO BE FOR EVERYBODY LITERALLY EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD WHO WANTS TO TO TO TO TO READ IT AND YET AT THE SAME TIME I WANTED TO A STAY ABSOLUTELY RIGOROUSLY CLOSE TO THE THE SCIENCE THAT WAS ACTUALLY KNOWN A WHEN I WAS SPEAKING ABOUT SCIENCE WHEN SPEAKING ABOUT THAHA NERBIOLITY OF THO THE BRAIN OR OR PSYCHITRA ON IT TO TO NOT HAVE ANY OF MY SCIENTIFIC COLLEAGUES THINK O HE'S HE'S GOING TOO FAR  SING TOO MUCH AND SO I HAD THESE THESE TWO GULLS WHICH I KEPT ON MY MIND THE ENTIRE TIME AND AND A LOT OF THIS TRYING TO FIND EXACTLY THE RIGHT WORD WE TALKD ABOUT WAS ON THIS PATH OF STAYING EXCRUCIATINGLY RIGOROUS IN THE SCIENCE AND YET LETTING PEOPLE SEE THE HOPE THA THE HWER THINGS WERE HAVE EVERYBODY SEE THAT WE'VE COME A LONG WAY WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BUT BUT THE TRAJECTORY AND ATHE PATH IS IS BEAUTIFUL AND SO THAT THAT THAT WAS THE THE GOI I I THINK I YOU KNOW IOF COURSE THAT SOUNDS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO JOINTLY SATISFY THOSE TO THOSE TWO GULLS BUT I I KEPT THEN IN MY MIND THE WHOLWAY THOUH AN YES I AM OPTIMISTIC I THIN I HOPE THAT CAME THROUGH IN THE BOOK BUT IT CERTAINLY DID AND AT LEAST FROM THIS COLLAGUE UM A YOU YOU DID ACHIEVE BOOTH AND UM IT'S A WONDERFUL IT'S IT'S A MASTERFUL BOOK REALLY AND ONE THAT AS A SCIENTIST AND UM  SOMEBODY WHO IS A BRICK A FELLOW BRAIN EXPLORER A IT'S ALL THE MARKS OF OF RIGOR AND IS INCREDIBLY INTERESTING AND THERE'S A TON OF STORY TELLING I DON'T WONE TO GIVE AWAY TOO MUCH ABOUT IT BUT PEOPLE SHOULD

I CASE SO ONE O MY COORKERS DAVID CAST ABOUT STAR TO TELL ME ABOUT THIS THING AND REALLY I THOUGHT HE WAS COMPUELY I JUST DO S NO WAY IT COULD BE TRUE IT JUST SEEM COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS AND THEN I GOT TO SAY THE MORE HE EXPLAIN THE MORE IT SLOWLY STARTED TO SEE WIKE OCEB MAYBE HE'S RIGHT PORTAN FACT TO KNOW THAT DAVID BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER HEAT'S PAGETY AN PHYSICS WORKED AT FIRMY LAB ON SUBATOMIC PARTICLES WAS ON THE TEAM THAT DISCOVERED THE TOP QUARK N ND THIS WHOLE THING UP BETWEEN HIM AND ME BEGAN WHEN HE TOLD ME TO DOWNLOAD AN AP ON TO MY EYE FOM IT'S CALLED AM UNIVERSE SPLITTER A CASE ENOUGH OPENED IT UP AND THERE'S LIKE A GRAY STEEL FAKE STEEL BACKGROUND AND SAYS IN WHITE TYPE ON TOP OF IT UNIVERSE SPLITTER QUANT OM INDUCED UNIVERSE BY FURCATION WHAT DO I DO NOW IIT SO TELL ME SOMETHING YOU OR HAVING TROUBLE MAKING UP YOUR MIND ABOUT WHAT TO DO UM YOU AND I RECORTING THIS ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST YE AND I'VE HAD A WEEK OFF I GREW A BEARD I NOTICE OM I DON'T TRY TO DECIDE IF I SHOULD SHAVE IT OFF A AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING I'M TRYING TO DECIDE I HAVE AN OPINION ON THAT BUT WHAT YOUR PINION EI SHALLI THINK IT LOOKS PRETTY GITTERIT NOW O GETS SO WHAT IS THIS UNIVERSE SPLITTERD DO IT LETS YOU DO BOTH I GET CREATES A DUPLICIT OF THIS UNIVERSE SO THAT IN ONE YOU GET TO GROW THE BEARD AND IN THE OTHER YOU SHAVE IT OFF WAIT THAT SO WER GOING TO DO YET FOR PRETENDER FOR REAL NO NOG FOR REAL MAY BE THIS IS A THING IT'S CALLED THE MANY WORLD'S INTERPRETATION OF QUANTA MECHANICS THAT A LOT OF REALLY SMART PHYSICISTS WHO THINK THIS IS PROBABLY WHAT'S HAPPENING A CASE SO HOW DOES THIS WORK LIKE WHAT DO I DO NEXT RIT SO SO THAT TWO BOXES THERE YE IN ONE BOX IT SAYS IN ONE UNIVERSE I WILL NOW OKI SO PUT A SHAVE OFF BEARD TO NIGHT U T OFF BEARD TO NIGHT OK AND THEN THE OTHER BOXES LABELED IN THE OTHER UNIVERSE AND THE OTHER ONE I WILL NOW PUT KEEP BEARD KEEP BEARD O I THEN WHAT'S BELOW IT AND THEN BEGOD THERE'S LIKE A BUTTON WITH LIKE AN ADAM DRAWN ON IT WHAT I CAN ADAM LIKE YOU WOULD DRAW IT IN LIKE A NINETEEN FIFTIES CARTOON LIKE YET THAT'S LIKE THE ESTHETIC OF THEWHOLE THING IT I GOT OLD PIECE OF SCIENTIFIC EQUIPMENT SO WHAT DOES IT DO WHEN YOU PUSH THE BUTTON SO IF YOU PUSH THE BUTTON IT SENDS A SIGNAL TO A FANCY PIECE OF SCIENTIFIC EQUIPMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF GENEVAN SWITZERLAND THE QUIPMENT THESE DAYS CAN BE TINY LIKE A LITTLE BOX YOU CAN HOLD IN YOUR HAND AND IT DOES THE FOLLIN IT TAKES A SINGLE PARTICLE OF LIGHT A PHOTON IT SENDS IT AT A KIND OF MIRROR THI CAN MAKE THE VOTON EITHER GO LEFT OR RIGHT YOU CAN MAKE AFIT THAT WAY LIKE A RANDOM IT'LL GO EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT WELL ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF QUANTO MECHANICS WHICH GOVERNORIT GOVERNED VERY SMALL THINGS AH IT ACTUALLY GOES BOTH IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T KNOW IT ACTUALLY GOES LEFT AND RIGHT AT THE SAME TIME OKE SO THAT'S SUPERWEAR RIGHT BUTTHAT IS ACTUALLY TRUE AND DEMONSTRATED AN LIKE WE'VE KNOWN THAT SINCE THE TWENTIETH OKET SO THEN WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS DEVICE IN GENEVA YES STHE DEVICE FIRES A PHOTON WHICH CAN GO LEFT O RIGHT AND THEN THE DEVICE LOOKS TO SEE WELL WHERE DID IT GO AND WE KNOW THE PARTICLES IN BOTH PLACES RIGHT UT WHEN HE MACHINE LOOKS IT ONLY FINDS IT IN ONE PLACE SHOWS IT WENT EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT OH WHICH DOESN'T MAKE SENSE RIGHT CAUSE WE KNOW FROM THE MATH THAT THE PARTICLE DID GO TO BOTH PLACES SO WHY DID WE ONLY SEE IT IN ONE O THOSE PLACES AND WHAT'S THE ANSWER IIT'SO SO ONE OF THE ANSWERS IS THAT THE PHOTON IS IN BOTH PLACES LEFT AND RIGHT BUT JUST IN DIFFERENT UNIVERSES WAIT SO YOUR SAYING THAT WHEN YOU SHOOT THE PHOTON INTO THE MIRROR IT ACTUALLY CREATES AND ENTIRE DUPLICATE OF OUR UNIVERSE AND ONE OF THOSE UNIVERS IS THE FHOTANIS ON THE LEFT AND THE OTHER IT IS ON THE RIGHT YES IT BOTH WENT LEFT AND RIGHT THOSE ARE JUST INDIFFERENT UNIVERSES THE MATH OF IT MAKES A LOT OF THE MATH OF IT IS VERY LIKE ETREME LINE AND SIMPLE I MEMBER LIKE THE DAY I SOUGHT IN GLASS NOWS LIKE HOME MY GOD MAYBE IT'S TRUE YES SO THESE BOXES YOU FILL THAT ON THE AP HOMEN THE BOX WARY I TEPED IN A SHAVE OFF YER TO NIGHT AND THE BOX RIGHT TYPED IN I KEEP BEARD RIGHT RIGHT SO ITTALE BASICALLY CHOOSE ONE OF THOSE BOXES IF THE PHOTON GOES LEFT AND THE OTHER BOX IF THE PHOTON GOES RIGHT O KAK GOT IT YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT IT SAYS OU MAY HAVE TO KEEP THE BEARD OR SHAVE OFF THE BEARD LIKE IT TELLS ME YE YES CAUSE WHEN YOU PRESS THAT BUTTON YOU'RE GOING TO GET BACK ONE ANSWER BUT THEIS GOING TO BE A DUPLICATE UNIVERSE IN WHICH THERE IS A DUPLICATE YOW SITTING IN A DUPLICATE STUDIO AND DUPLICATE ME AND YOU HOLDING A DUPLICATE PHONE IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT THAT PHONE COMES BACK WITH THE OTHER ANSWER AND THEN THAT VERSION OF ME WE'LL DO WHATEVER IT SAYS IN THE PHONE WE KNOW THAT O THER GUY WE TRUST HIM HE'S GOING TO GO DO THE OTHER OKE I THINK I UNDERSTAND ALL THIS WHAT'S GLAD DUNIPERSIPON O PUSHION I  TO FEEL WEARD IFOUT I FEEL WEARD I KNOW IT'S CRAZY I FEEL WEARD YOU LITERLY JUST PUT YOUR FINGER RIGHT UP TO THE BUTTON TAN PULTED AWAY IN FEAR I ECAS SPLY UNIVERSE E CASES HAS AND PUT VOUIT INTO AT CONTACT AN GANO ON HINE TO VICERAT AN PRO TINA MAA ONTOAGAN YOUR UNIVERSE IS JUST SPIT YOUR IN THE UNIVERSE IN WHICH HE SHOULD KEEP BEARD AND RIGHT NOW IN THE OTHER UNIVERSE THE OTHER YEARSE BEING TOLD TO SHAVE OFF BEARD TONIGHT SO AFTER THAT I KEPT THE RER THAT NIGHT AND FRENCS OF NEW YOARS PARTIES ASKED ME ABOUT IT AND IF THE UNIVERSE DID IN FACT SPLIT THE OTHER VERSION OF ME AND THE OTHER UNIVERSE MUST HAVE HAD DIFFERENT CONVERSATIONS MAY BE FOR INSTANCE SOMEBODY GAVE HIM A GREAT IDEA FOR A SHOW TO DAY

SCIENTIST WHO REALLY BELIEVE THAT A SECOND UNIVERSE GETS CREATED YET FOR SURE I MAN I THINK IT'S NOT MOST PHYSICIS AND THERE'RE SOME WHO THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS FOR SURE BUT THERE'RE SOME WHO TAKE ITE VERY SERIOUSLY O CA WHERE IS THIS ALTERNATE UNIVERSE THAT WERE CREATID YET I NON'T REALIEVEN KNOW HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS BUT IF THIS IS TRUE  UNIVERSE IS DUPLICATING ITSELF ALL THE TIME IT'S LIKE A

I I MEAN I REMEMBER WRITING IT I THOUGHT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING FOR HIM TO SAY AND WHEN I HEAR IT NOW I STILL THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING FOR HIM TO SAY IT'S NOTABLL THAT SHROM HAD THE PRESIDENT APOLOGIZING TO MONICA WINTI IN OUR FAMILY AT THE TIME CHARLES RANGLE OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMEN FROM NEW YARK CALLED HER CRURT AND DONE TRAMP SHE AS THE SUBJECT OF JOKES ON LIGHT NIGHT TELL VISION BILL MYR SAID I THINK MONICA LUINSKI'S THE LONISHAN APOLOGIZED TO AMERICA NO ONE SEEMED TO BE THINKING ABOUT HER AS A PERSON WHOS LIFE WAS NOW ERECT SHRUM WES WELL ANDSHE WAS A AN IN TURN KID IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND I THOUGHT THAT THAT MAD EVERY BIT OF SENSE IN THE WORLD SHRUM SENT THE SPEECH INTO THE WHITE HOUSE AND THEN THE DAY ARRIVED CLINTON GAVE HIS GRANDJERY TESTIMONY WHICH WAS NOT BRIDCAST  THAT EVENING THE PRESIDENT WENT ON T V TO GIVE HIS SPEECH SHRUM SAT DOWN WITH THE REST OF THE COUNTRY TO WATCH IT WE'RE JUST SITTING AROUND IN THE LIVING ROOM WATCHING IT ON TALIVISH AND AT THAT POINT AY THINKING MAYBE H'S GAN TO READ MY SPEECH SURE I THOUGHT HE I THOUGHT HE MIGHT VERY WELL BILL CLENTON WHO I WORKED WITH ON LIKE STATE OF THE UNION MESSAGES NEVER EXACTLY READS WHAT YOU SEND HIM SO I DIDN'T ANTICIPATE THAT IT WOULD BE NECESSARILY WORD FOR WORD WHAT I HAD SENT BUT I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE PRETTY CLOSE TO IT AH IT WAS ALMOST I AMETRICALLY THE OPPOSITE GOOD EVENING THIS AFTERNOON IN THIS ROOT FRON THIS CHAR I TESTIFIED BEFORE THE OFFICE OF INDEPENDENT COUNCIL IN THE GRANDJEURY I ANSWERE THEIR QUESTIONS TRUTHFULLY INCLUDING QUESTIONS ABOUT MY PRIVATE LIFE QUESTIONS NO AMERICAN CITIZEN WOULD EVER WANT TO ANSWER I NOT ONLY REMEMBER HEARING THE FIRST WORDS BUT I REMEMBER THE LOOK ON HIS FACE HE WAS REALLY REALLY ANGRY IT'S THE PRIVATE BILL CLINTON WHO COULD GET ANGRY AND I HAVE SEEN HIM ANGRY BUT I DON'T THINK THE COUNTRY HAD SEEN HIM ANGRY VERY OFTEN AS YOU KNOW IT A DEPOSITION IN JANUARY I WAS ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MODICAL OWINSKEY WHILE I ANSWERS WERE LEGALLY ACCURATE I DID NOT VOLUNTEER INFORMATION INDEED I DID HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH MISTE WINSKEY THAT WAS NOT APPROPRIATE IN FACT IT WAS WRONG IT CONSTITUTED A CRITICAL LAPSIN JUDGMENT AN A PERSONAL FAILURE ON MY PART FOR WHICH I AM SOLELY AND COMPLETELY RESPONSIB THERE ARE MOMENTS OF APOLOGY IN THERE AND WOULD FEEL LIKE HONEST REFLECTION LIKE WHEN HE STRAIGHT UP ADMITS THE REASONS HE HAD BEEN SO EVASIVE UNTIL THEN I CAN ONLY TELL YOU I WAS MUTIVATED BY MANY FACTORS FIRST I DESIRE TO PROTECT MYSELF FROM THE EMBARRASSMENT OF MY OWN CONDUCT BUT THE OVER ALL MESSAGE IS NOT IAM SORRY I SCREWED UP HE SEEMS TO BE SAYING BUT THE REAL PROBLEM IS THE FACT THAT I'M HAVING TO TALK ABOUT THIS AT ALL IT'S A PRIVATE FAMILY MATTER IT'S NOBODY'S BUSINESS BUT OURS EVEN PRESIDENTS HAVE PRIVATE LIVES HE CLOSES NOT BY ASKING FOR FORGIVENESS IS TROM HAD ADVISED BUT BY ASKING PEOPLE TO STOP CALKING AND SO TO NIGHT I ASKED YOU TO TURN AWAY FROM THE SPECTACLE OF THE PAST SEVEL MONTS TO REPAIR THE FABRIC OF OUR NATIONAL DISCOURSE AND TO RETURN OUR ATTENTION TO ALL THE CHALLENGES AND ALL THE PROMISE OF THE NEXT AM MERICANCENTURYE THANK YOU FOR WATCH AND COULD NOT WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAPPENE IF HE INSTEAD THAT NIGHT HE'D TAKEN OUT YOUR SPEECH IND READIT I THINK IT WOULD HAVE LESSON THE CHANCES THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPEACHED REALLY I DON'T KNOW THAT IT WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE IMPEACHMENT BUT I THINK IT WOULD HAVE LESSEN THE CHANCEES IT'S POSSIBLE HIS SPEECH GETS YOU TO THE SAME ENDING JUST WITH A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PLOT AFTER ALL THERE IS A LOT OF MOMENTUM IN CONGRESS TOWARD IMPEACHMENT BUT IT'S NICE TO CONTEMPLATE A WORLD WET THE LEADER OF YOUR COUNTRY CAN STAND UP AND ACKNOWLEDGE HAVING MADE A MISTAKE CAN ACKNOWLEDGE REALITY AND APOLOGY REALLY IS ABOUT THE TRUTH LAYING IT OUT SO WE CAN ALL LIVE IN THE SAME WORLD TOGETHER IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO MAGINE THAT HAPPENING NOW CLINTON SEEMED CLOSER TO IT AT THAT MOMENT BUT HE STILL COULDN'T DO IT I I WONDER IF ALL THE POSSIBLE UNIVERSE IS AND HOW MANY OF THEM DOES CLINTON SAY I AM SORRY YOU KNOW NOT I'M SORRY FOR WHAT HAPPENED OR I AM SORRY IF PEOPLE FEEL OU KNOW BUT BUT REALLY LIKE I'M SORRY THERE MAY BE A UNIVERSE IN WHICH HE DID THAT I'VE JUST NOT AWARE OF IT CAUSE I DON'T LIVE IN IT S THAT THE ONE WE LIVE IN YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I THINK I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THERE IS NO UNIVERSE IN WHICH PRESIDENT CLINTON READS BOBSHRUM SPEECH LISTENINK TO THE SPEECH CLINTON DID GIVE I KIN I THINK HE GIVES IT IN EVERY POSSIBLE UNIVERSE IT WAS EXACTLY HOW HE FELT AND AND THE SPEECH THT YOU WROTE WHILL GREAT WAS NOT AT ALL HOW HE WAS FEEL THAMENT I I OBVIOUSLY THE SPEECH THAT I THA THAT I DRAFTED DID NOT REFLECT HOW HE FELT COMING OUT OF THE GREANTURY IN THAT SENSE CAN YOU FALT HIM I I JUST SAY IT YOU WANT TO DO WHAT FITS THE MOMENT AND YOU WNT TO BE TRUE TO YOURSELF THE PROBLEM WAS THAT I THINK HE WAS TRUE TO THE ANGRY GUY WHO HAS JUST COME OUT OF THE ROOM YOU KNOW HE H WAS MAY BE NOT TRUE TO THE PERSON HE WAS THE NEXT DAY THERE ARE THE YOUS IN ALL THE PARALLEL WORLD WUT OSI DO YOU ON THURSDAY AND THE ONE ON FRIDAY  WANTE HAS HAD SOME TIME TO THINK AND SOME SLEEP AND THE SAME WHICH FOR SURE DOES OUR DIFFERENT PEOPLE THEY TESTAN BOUN AND SOME OTHER UNIVERSE HE STATE IF PHISIS TIS TRAL OF HIS LIFE IN THIS ONE HE IS THE EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF OUR PROGRAMM BELL CLEN BY THE WAY WAY TO WROTE ABOUT THIS ADDRESS TOF THE NATION THAT NIFE IN HIS BIOGRAPHY ET IS NOT MENTION TRUMSTRAFTER THE SPEECH BUT HE OS SAY THAT MOST OF HIS ADVISERS AD COUNTSEN ANT TO SIMPLY ADMIT THAT HE HAD MADE AN ALTHIN STATE NOT TO GO OUT SWINGIN HE DID ANYTON OF COURSE WEK'S AFTER THAT SPEECHHY BACK TRACT IN FRONT OF A SMALLER AUDIENCE AT PAR BREAKFAST WITH RELIGIOUS LEATERS HE TOOK A DIFFERENT TONE THERE HE SAID I AGREE WITH THOSE WHO HAVE SAID THAT IN MY FIRST STATEMENT AFTER I TESTIFIED I WAS NOT CONTRITE ENOUGH WAS MUCH CLOSE WHITH TRUMADRY INCLUDED AN APOLOGY TO MY UNCLE WINSKY AND HER FAMILY COMING OUT WERRY

HALL AND THEY STILL LOOKED EXACTLY THE SAME RANDY CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT JASON LOOKS LIKE VERY GOOD LOOKING AM JHAING HE IS VERY SOMITIC LOOKING HE'S GOT GLASSIS AT HE'S ABOUT FIVE FOOT E AN A HALF IT'S CENSE SOMEWHAT ATHLETIC LOOKING LESS CENCE THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT THEIR POTENTIALLY SWOPPED IDENTITIES WHEN THEY WERE ABOUT TWELVE YEARS OLD BY ACCIDENT THEY WER SPENDING A SUMMER WEEKEND AT THE WORLD FAMOUS LEAK OF THE OSARCS AN CENTRAL MISSERRI WITH THEIR MAM AND AUNT LINDA AND HER TWO SONS THE BOYS WERE PLAYING WHILE ANETTE NANTLANTO TALKED AMONGST THEMSELVES THE STORY OF THE CALAMITOUS DOCTORS AS IT CAME UP AND UNBENOUNCED TO THEM JASON AND RANDY WERE AN YEAR SHOT AND THEY OVERHEARD THE WHOLE THING AND WE WERE JUST WE HATED THE STORY THIS US JASON THE SOUNDS RE MARKABLY LIKE RANDY WE WE WERE LIVID THAT THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED AN ALSO THAT SHE WAS SHARING IT IN SORT OF AN OFF AND THE JOKING WAKE AND LINOWALLACE WHO IS A FUNNY WOMAN WAS MAKING IT FUNNIER AND THEY WERE LAUGHING ABOUT AERE LIKE WE WERE JUST VERY EMBARRASSED BY IT AND UPSET LIKE LIKE ALL MY GODISS ISN'T I SANG THING TO HEAR CAUSE WE MAY NOT BE WHO WE ARE WHAT PISSED YOU OFF ABOUT IT WHAT WAS SO UPSETTING ABOUT IT I THINK THAT IT JUST WAS WE WERE JUST SENSITIVE I THINK TO BEING CONFUSED AND AGAIN IT WAS THIS NARRATIVE THAT CONNA WENT THROUGH OUR LIVES AS WE WANTED TO BE INDIVIDUALS AND WE WANTED TO BE SEEN AS INDIVIDUALS AND THEN HEARS THIS THING THAT HAPPENED WEARE WE COULD BE SO EASILY CONFUSED FOR IDENTICAL TWINS TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE CONSTANTLY BEING MISTAKEN FOR ONE ANOTHER WE TRY REALLY HARD TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THEIR UNIQUE INDIVIDUALS THIS WAS A BIG DEAL RANDY WAS THE MOST UPSET E GOES WHY CAN'T YOU GO TO THE TO THE POLICEMEN I THINK GRANDY REALLY WANTED ME TO GO THEIRE YOU WERE TALKING ALL THE WAY TO THE CARD NOT THAT AN ACTUAL CRIME HAD BEEN COMMITTED JUST A CRIME AGAINST THEIR DIGNITY THAT FOR SOME REASON RANDY FIGURED THE POLICE FOR THE ONES WHO COULD SORTED OUT BUT A NUT DID NOT GO TO THE POLICE AND THE NAME CONFUSION DID NOT GET SORTED OUT IT REMAINED A MYSTERY AND JASON AND RANDYES LIVES E COUPLE CIN E WIT OT OT OT OR YEAR  CO BTY CA CO ING ABOUT IT A WA GOT I AAB I DON IN IT A AGET WHOW I HAD NO INDEA WAS THAT THAT I'M PAINFUL FOR THEM I MA A E WI I JO BE TWEN A NAT NI AT I NO CUR WIT EJO BETWEEN ALL ABOT ICA A WER ERY A  CA ABOUT IT JUST THE SIMPLE FACT OF THE MATTER THAT FOR COUNTLESS TIMES IN OUR LIVES SOME ONE HAS SAID TO ME JASON AND I'M LIKE NOOM RANDY RAY YOU KNOW LIKE THAT THAT'S HAPPENS SO MANY TIMES IN MY LIFE IF THAT'S NOT TRUE THERE IS YOONLY GOO LIKE TO EVERY SIDON IEVN ON OA BUTTHERE'S THERE'S A NOTION THAT LIKE YOU'VE BEEN LIVING A LITTLE BIT OF ALIKE IT'S A TINY LIKE BUT IT'S NOT YOUR LIVES NOT YOUR LINE IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT BUT STILL THAT IS THAT'S UNSETTLING IN A WEIRD WAY TO ME THAT'S JUST WEIRD THAT FOR ALL THIS TIME I HAD AT WRONG IF THEY WERE SWITCHE AND THEY HAVE TO REIMAGINE SOMETHING THAT SO FOUNDATIONAL NOBODY EVER THINKS ABOUT IT THEIR BIRTH WHO'S OLDER WHO IS IN THE INCUBATOR LHA GRANDY SAYS ITS WEIRD DOESN'T REALLY MAKE A DIFFERINTS BUT ALSO SOMEHOW IT DOES AND NOT KNOWING WHAT THE TRUTH IS THAT'S EVEN MORE UNNERVING N IT TURNS OUT THERE WAS ONE WAY TO FIGURE IT OUT SOMETIME ROUND THE AGE OF FORTY RANDY CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHEN THE TOPIC OF THEIR POTENTIALLY SWAPPED IDENTITIES CAME OUT AND THEY WERE LIKE WHY THON WE FIGURE THE SOUT YET THEY ARE GROWN OUT CADULTS THEY SHOULD KNOW WHO THEY ACTUALLY WERE AND ALSO THEY WERE WORKING AS COMEDIANS AT THAT POINT AND THEY THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE GOOD MATERIAL WHICH WELL SEE TRANDY THOUGHT MAY BE THE HOSPITAL WHERE THEY WERE BORN WOULD HAVE A COPY OF THEIR BABY FINGER PRINTS THEY COUN GET THOSE AND COMPARE THEM TO THEIR DELT FINGER PRINTS HE WASN'T WRONG ABOUT THE SIGNS PART OF THAT THAY DENTICAL TWINS HAVE NEARLY THE SAME DEANAM SO THEIR FINGER PRINT PATTERNS AR VERY SIMILAR CLOSER THAN ANY ONE ELSE'S TAS YOU PROBABLY KNOW FINGER PRINTS ARE MADE UPOF LINES AND SOME OF THOSE LINES HAVE TINY VARIATIONS ON THEM LIKE FORKS OR LEAPS AND THOSE MARKINGS ARE DIFFERENT BETWEEN IDENTICAL TWINS FOR THOSE OF YOU STILL LISTENING THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THE MARKINGS DEVELOPED BASED ON THE CONDITIONS IN THE WOMB LIKE PRESSURE WHICH IS DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON WHERE THE BABY IS IN THE WOMB SO RANDY CALLED THE HOSPITAL WHERE THEY WERE BORN TO SEE IF THEY STILL HAD A COPY OF THEIR FINGER PRINTS THE HOSPITAL TOLD THEM THAT THEY THROW BIRTH RECORDS OUT AFTER THIRTY YEARS THEY WERE OLD AND OUT OF L UNTIL I WAS BACK HOME LAST SUMMER WITH MY FAMILY THIS IS RANDY AND I WAS DIGGING THROUGH JUST LOOKING AT STUFF IN SAINTLO IN SAINT LOUIS HO'S BACK IN OUR CHILDHOOD HOME THAT WE LIVED IN SINCE WE ARE FOUR YEARS OLD AND I FOUND FROM THE HOSPITAL OUR FOOTPRINTS I I REFRE TA THEY WERE IN A BOOK HE SHAT ID AV THE AS YOUR BAGS AN MY BED THERE WAS LIKE A NIGHTSTAND THING THAT WAS LIKE A CHEST THAT YOU COULD OPEN UPEN IT WAS JUST IN THE BOTTOM OF THAT I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT AND I'D NEVER SEEN IT THERE BEFORE AND I THOUGHT O KA THIS IS WE COULD FIND OUT IT BECAME MORE REAL REAL IN THE PIABILITY WAS REKINDLED IF THEY COULD FIND SOME ONE TO COMPARE THEIR ADULT FOOTPRINTS TO THEIR BABY FOOTPRINTS MAYBE THEY COULD PUT THIS MYSTERY TO BED ONCE AND FOR ALL AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT THERE WAS JUST SUCH A PERSON IND BOIN A PART CALIFORNIA ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILES FROM LOST ANGELISTS WHERE JASON AND RANDY NOW LIVE A FER RENSICK IDENTIFICATION SPECIALIST BY THE NAME OF CURT COON THA CURT SAID THERE WAS NO WAY HE COULD USE A BABY FOOTPRINT FROM A HOSPITAL THOS AREN'T MADE FOR IDENTIFICATION PURPOSES THE'RE MAYE BE CAUSE BABY FEED OR FREEKING CUED THEIR MOMENTOUS AND THEY USUALLY DON'T HAF MUCH DETAIL IN JUNE JASON SENT HURT THE FOOTPRINTS ANYWAY JUST A CHECK AND WHEN KURT SAW THEM HE CONFIRMED THAT THEY WERE MOSTLY JUST UNUSABLE S MUCH AS A BANK BUT MIRACULOUSLY THERE WAS A HALF INCH SPOT ON THE FALL OF THE LEFT JASON FOOT THAT HAD NICE CLEAR LINES HE SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM MAKING THE IDENTIFICATION HE JUST NEEDED JASON AND RANDYE'S ADULT FEET JASED WITH THE IMMINENT REVELATION OF THEIR TRUE IDENTITIES JASON AND RANDY WERE FORCED TO THINK THROUGH WHAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLYD DO IF THEY'D BEEN SWITCHED AS BABIES WHICH LESS BE HONEST IS NOT ALONG LIST OF CONSIDERATIONS D YOU THINK YE'D SWAP NAMES OR WOULD WE LEGALLY CHANGE OUR NAMES MI BES YHOU OTHERS AND IF YOU ARE IF YOU ARE SWAP THAN YOUR KIND OF LIY COMMITTING FRAUD ALL THE TIME RITE NOW I GENE ENTIONALLY ON INTENTIONAL FRA YET YOU'RE WHY I WOULD BE USING HIS SOCIAL SCURITY NUMBER RA YOU KNOW HOW IS THAT EFFECT EVERYTHING WE DO I WONDER IF IT DOES AN MAY MAYBE 'T ONLY MATTERS IF LIKE ONE OF YOU COMMITS MURDER BAREFOOT AND THEN RUNS THROUGH WETS MEN OR SOMETHING THE RIHT MAYBE PRACTICALLY IT DOESN'T ACT AY MATTER OW IS OUT YOU CAN'T E THAT Y THAT THANKS O TAT MAYBE IT DOESN'T MATTER I'M PROBABLY RIGHT ABOUT THAT EXCEPT THERE'S ONE PERSON WHO JASON WAS LEGITIMATELY WORRIED ABOUT THERMAM ANETTE WHO THEY'RE VERY CLOSE WITH THEIRE FATHER DIED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE ANNETTES HAD TWO STROKES AND RECENT YEARS THEY'RE PROTECTIVE OUT HER BUT  SHE GOT IT WRONG ALL THOSE YEARS AGO I WOULD FEEL BAD FOR ARMAN YES HIY MORE ABOUT THAT I WOULD FEEL LIKE MAYBE SHE WOULD BE EMBARRASSED OR MAYBE SHE WOULD FEEL LIKE SHE SHOULD HAVE SPOKEN UP AND MAYBE FOUND OUT AWAY IN THAT MOMENT TO GET OUR

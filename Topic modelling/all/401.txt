WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAPONPANS A SCIENCE SCIENCE SPACS TO FORLIE I MAYDRHUBERMEN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NAROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE DISCUSSING STIMULANTS IN PARTICULAR STIMULANTS FOR THE TREATMENT OF EIGHT HT OR ATTENTION DEFISITE HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THEIREIS TREMENDOUS INTEREST IN DRUGS LIKE ADARAL RIDDLIN VIVANTS AND OTHER STIMULANTS AS WELL AS NON STIMULANT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE THE SYMPTOMS OF EGHTY HT SUCH AS MODAPHANIL ARMODAPHANEL AND GUANPHOSINE TO DAY I'M GOING TO DISCUSS ALL OF THESE COMPOUNDS IN THE CONTEXT OF HOW THEY WORK TO IMPROVE THE SYMPTOMS OF EIHTY HT I'M GOING TO ADDRESS COMMON QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE COMPOUNDS SUCH AS ARE THEY JUST SPEED ARE THEY SIMILAR TO METH OR METHAMPHEDAMIE I'LL TALK ABOUT THEIR ADDICTIVE POTENTIAL AS WELL AS THEIR PROTENTIAL TO CAUSE PSYCOTIC SYMPTOMS BOTH IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM AND OF COURSE I WILL TALK ABOUT THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE SURROUNDING THE MOST FREQUENTLY ASK QUESTION ABOUT THESE COMPOUNDS WHICH IS WHAT ARE THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES OF TAKING ANY OF THEM IN CHILDHOOD OR IN ADULTHOOD NOW TO DAY'S DISCUSSION CENTERS AROUND THE USE OF THESE COMPOUNDS BOTH FOR CHILDHOOD AND FOR ADULT EIGHTY HT BUT OF COURSE I BE REMISS IF I DIN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT USE THESE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THEIR ABILITY TO FOCUS AND INDEED ALSO USE THEM RECREATIONALLY IN FACT SOME SURVEYS REVEAL THAT AS HIGH AS EIGHTY PER CENT OF COLLEGE AGE YOUNG ADULTS HAVE USED ONE OR SEVERAL OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SUCH AS ADERAL RIDDLEAND VIVANTS OR SIMILAR AT SOME POINT AND ARE DOING SO WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTIONS SO THEY ARE EITHER OBTAINING THOSE DRUGS FROM THOSE THAT DO HAVE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR THEM FOR EGHT HT OR THEY ARE OBTAINING THEM THROUGH BLACK MARKET SOURCES WHICH OF COURSE CARRIES IN A DITIONAL AND VERY SERIOUS RISK RELATED TO THE SO CALD FENTINAL CRISIS THAT IS AS HIGH AS SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF BLACK MARKET DRUGS NOWADAYS OF VARIOUS KINDS BUT CERTAINLY INCLUDING THE SORTS OF DRUGS WERE GIN A TALK ABOUT TODAY OR CONTAMINATED WITH FENTINEL AND THEREFORE ARE VERY DEADLY SO TO DAY I'M GOING TO DESCRIBE WHAT THESE VARIOUS DRUGS REALLY ARE HOW THEY WORK AT THE LEVEL OF NURONS AND BRAIN NETWORKS AND HOW THEY CHANGE THOSE BRAIN NETWORKS IN WAYS THAT REALLY CAN ALLOW PEOPLE WITH EIGHTY HT TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS BETTER I WILL ANSWER THE COMMON QUESTION WHICH IS WHY IS IT THAT GIVING CHILDREN SPEED BECAUSE INDEED SEVERAL NOT ALL BUT SEVERAL OF THE COMPOUNDS I'M GOING TO DISCUSS OR SPEED THEY ARE AM PHEDMINE WHY WOULD THAT CAUSE A REDUCTION IN HYPERACTIVITY IF SPEED IS A STIMULANT ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR YOU AND I WILL ALSO ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT ARE COMMONLY ASKED SUCH AS HOW THESE DRUGS IMPACT THINGS LIKE SLEEP HORMONE HEALTH REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AS WELL AS WHAT IS THERE IMPACT ON HEIGHT INDEED IT WAS ONE PROMINENT HYPOTHESIS THAT THESE EIGHTY EIGHT STEMEDS COULD ACTUALLY RESTRICT THE HEIGHT OF CHILDREN ALL TELL YOU WHETHER NOT THAT'S ACTUALLY TRUE OR NOT AND I'LL DISCUSS THE DATA SURRMOUNDING WHETHER NOT THESE DRUGS PREDISPOSE PEOPLE TO BE COMING ATTICS TO OTHER SUBSTANCES EVEN IF PEOPLE CEASE OR CONTINUE TAKING THE STIMULANTS THAT CAN HELP THEM IN THE CLINICAL SENSE FOR EIGHTY EHST BEFORE WE BEGIN ID LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTOC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME ID LIKE THE THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S POTCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALTH MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR NOW SALT MAGNSIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURO S TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLYTES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLIKE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHISITES IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACTELECTROLIKE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MELIGRAMS THAT ONE GRAM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDER MILEGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'VE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENTY DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT ELEEMENTY DOCOM SLASH HUBERMEN LET'S TALK ABOUT TREATMENTS FOR EIGHTY GHT AND WHY STIMULANT TREATMENTS IN PARTICULAR CAN BE SO EFFECTIVE FIRST OF ALL IT'S LONG BEEN KNOWN THAT THEIR SPECIFIC BRAIN NETWORKS INVOLVED IN WHAT WE CALL ATTENTION NOW ATTENTION IS NOT ONE THING ACTUALLY IT INVOLVES SEVERAL DIFFERENT COGNATIVE OPERATIONS INCLUDING THE SUPPRESSION OF NOISE THAT IS TURNING DOWN THE BACKGROUND CHATTER IN OUR HEADS AND TURNING DOWN OUR ATTENDING TO THINGS OUTSIDE US LIKE NOISES OR VISUAL CUES THAT ARE NOT RELEVANT TO WHAT WE WANT TO DO AND IT ALSO INVOLVES RAMPING UP OR ATTENDING OR FOCUSING ON PARTICULAR THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING EITHER IN OUR IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT OR IN OUR HEAD OR BOTH SOF THAT ALL SOUNDS RATHER COMPLEX INDEED IT IS IND INVOLVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT NETWORKS OPERATING IN PARALLEL BUT WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE BASED ON A LOT OF CLENICAL AND SCIENTIFIC LABORATORY DATA IS THAT THE SO CALL PREFRONTAL QUARTEC THE REGION OF NEURL REAL ESTATE IN YOUR BRAIN JUST BEHIND YOUR FOREHEAD IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR OR CUSTRATING WHICH NEURAL CIRCUITS ARE GOING TO BE MORE OR LESS ACTIVE AT A GIVEN MOMENT IN ORDER TO BRING ABOUT WHAT WE CALL FOCUS OR ATTENTION OR TASKS SWITCHING OR OUR ABILITY INDEED TUMULTI TASK BECAUSE WE CAN ACTUALLY MULTITASKS TO SOME EXTENT IN FACT IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT SOMEBODY AND A FOCUS ON PERHAPS THE EPRESSION ON THEIR FACE YOU COULD DO THAT WHILE ALSO ATTENDING TO A CONVERSATION THAT'S HAPPENING NEARBY IT'S ENERGETICALLY DEMANDING IT'S HARD TO DO BUT WE CAN DO THAT THAT'S AS HALLY REFERRD TO ITS COVERT ATTENTION YOUR COVERTLY PAYING ATTENTION TO SOMETHING ELSE AND THEN YOU CAN SWITCH THAT ATTENTION BACK TO JUST ONE THING OR ONE SMALL COLLECTION OF THINGS THE POINT BEING THAT ATTENTION IS A POWERFUL RESOURCE IT'S WHAT ALLOWS US TO NAVIGATE THROUGH LIFE WITH EFFICIENCY AND TO BE ADAPTIVE IN OUR BEHAVIORS IT'S WHAT ALLOWS US TO LEARN AND TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS AND HAVE SUCCESSFUL SCHOOL CAREERS AND PROFESSIONAL CAREERS AND SO ON BUT IT IS INDEED EXPENSIVE IT TAKES METABOLIC RESOURCES YOU NO JUST AT REST IF YOU WERE TO THINK ABOUT ESSENTUALLY NOTHING OR WHATEVER JUST POPS IN YOUR MIND WITH NO DEDICATED EFFORT TOWARD PAYING ATTENTION TO ANYTHING YOUR BRAIN WOULD CONSUME ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF YOUR DAILY COLORIC NEEDS AND THEN WHEN YOU LUMP ON TOP OF THAT YOUR NEED OR YOUR ATTEMPTS TO FOCUS ON THINGS TO PAY ATTENTION O SPECIFIC THINGS IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE AS TO WHY THAT OFTEN CAN MAKE US FEEL TIRED AS IF WE'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD IF WE'VE BEEN RUNNING ACCUORDING  MENTAL MARYTHON WHEN TRYING TO LEARN AND ATTEND TO THINGS IT'S HARD WORK FOR THE BRAIN AND YET WE CAN PAY ATTENTION BECAUSE OF THAT VERY PRECIOUS REAL ESTATE JUST BEHIND OUR FOREHEADS THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX NOW IN PEOPLE BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS THAT HAVE EGHTIHTY THEIR PREFUNTIL QUARTEX IS NOT NECESSARILY DEFICIENT IN ANY SPECIFIC WAY EXCEPT THAT IT IS NOT AS GOOD AT ORCHISTRATING THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER BRAIN NETWORKS OPERATING IN PARALLEL WITH IT WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT WELL IF WE TAKE A STEP BACK AND SAY WHAT IS THE PREFRONT OF QUOARTECTS REALLY DOING THE PREFUNTAL QUARTEX HAS THIS AMAZING ABILITY THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED TOP DOWN INHIBITION TO QUIET OTHER BRAINARIAS SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU ARE FEELING AGITATED BUT YOU NEED TO SIT STILL YOUR ABILITY TO SIT STILL EVEN IF IT TAKES A BIT OF WORK IS CORDINATED BY YOUR PREFRONTAL QUARTEX SENDING INHIBATORY SUPPRESSIVE ELECTRICAL SIGNALS TO THE NETWORKS OF YOUR BRAIN THAT ARE CHING TO GENERATE PHYSICAL ACTION IN ADDITION TO THAT IF YOU ARE IN A CONVERSATION THAT'S EITHER A DIFFICULT ONE OR A BORING ONE OR YOUARE TEMPTED TO INTERRUPT AND YOU'R ACTIVELY HOLDING BACK YOUR DESIRE TO WALK AWAY OR TO YAWN OR TO BLURT SOMETHING OUT IT'S YOUR PREFRONTAL QUARTEX THAT IS CONTROLLING THAT ACTIVE SUPPRESSION SO IN MANY WAYS YOU CAN JUST THINK OF THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX AS AN ORCHESTRA CONDUCTOR THAT IS ESSENTIALLY SAYING SSH OR NOT RIGHT NOW BE QUIET THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO MANY DIFFERENT BRAINNETWORKS ALL AT ONCE NOW IN ADDITION TO THAT YOUR REFRONTIAL QUARTEX IS CORDINATING WITH OTHER BRAIN NETWORKS THETTER INVOLVED IN GENERATING WHAT'S CALLED SALIENTS OR ATTENTION TO PARTICULAR SIGNALS SO THE PREFONTAL QUARTEX IN MANY WAYS IS LIKE A TEACHER OR AN ORCOESTRA CONDUCTOR IT CAN POINT TO IN THE NOR CHEMICAL SENSE THAT IS POINT TO A GIVEN BRAIN STRUCTURE AND SAY YOU I'D LIKE TO HEAR MORE FROM YOU RIGHT NOW YES YOU THE STUDENT IN THE BACK SPEAK UP AND A MOMENT LATER POINT TO A COLLECTION OF SMALL STUDENTS CHATTERING IN THE BACK GEN AM PRESENTING ALL THIS BIANALOGY AND SAY EY HEY YOU GOTS QUIET DOWNRIGHT NOW SO AND SO IS GOING TO COME UP TO THE FRONT OF THE ROOM AND HELP US WORK THROUGH THIS PARTICULAR MATH PROBLEM SO WHEN WE HEAR THAT THE PRFRONTAL QUARTEX EXERTS WHAT'S CALLED EXECUTIVE FUNCTION WHAT THAT REFERS TO IS THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX'S ABILITY TO QUIET THE ACTIVITY OF PARTICULAR NARL CIRCUITS AND TO ENHANCE OR INCREASE THE SALIENTS OF OTHER NERL CIRCUITS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN CREATING OUR SPOTLIGHT OF ATTENTION AND WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE BASED ON MANY MANY BRAIN IMAGING STUDIES IS THAT GHTY H T IS NOT NECESSARILY A DEFISIT AND PREFRONTAL CARTICAL FUNCTION BUT RATHER THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEXIS ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER BRAIN AREAS IN THE PROPER WAYS AND SO WHAT RESULT IN THE BRAIN OF A PERSON EITHER YOUNG OR OLD WITH EIGHTY H T IS THAT A LOT OF THE BACKGROUND CHATTER BECOMES VERY VERY LOUD SO FOR INSTANCE WE HAVE A BRAIN NETWORK CALL THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK THIS IS A FASCINATING BRAIN NETWORK THIS IS THE BRAIN NETWORK THAT IS ACTIVE WHEN YOU JUST SORT OF SIT IN PLACE AND DON'T THINK ABOUT MUCH AND THEN YOU START HAVING IDEAS ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT DO NEXT WEE IT TENDS TO BE VERY AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SO YOU MIGHT REMEMBER AN EXPERIENCE FROM THE PAST YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT SOME OF YOUR DESIRE SOME OF YOUR DISLIKES THIS DEFAULT MODE NETWORK AS IT'S CALLED IS ALSO INVOLVED IN OUR IMAGINATION  IN OUR SPOOLING TOGETHER OF DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES THAT WE'VE HAD IT DOESN'TTEND TO BE THE THING THAT'S REALLY FOCUSED ON ANYTHING EXTERNAL IN PARTICULAR ALL AT ONCE THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK IS ALWAYS ACTIVE BUT IT'S WHEN WE START TO ATTEND TO SOMETHING ESPECIALLY THINGS EXTERNAL TO US LIKE IT YOU KNOW SMETHING WRITTEN ON A PAGE OR CONVERSATION OR SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEED TO LEARN SOMETHING WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT THE ACTIVITY THE DEFAULTMODE NETWORK IS SUPPRESSED SOMEWHAT AND THAT SUPPRESSION OCCURS NOT JUST BY ACCIDENT BUT BECAUSE THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX IS ACTIVELY SUPPRESSING IT IN KIDS AND ADULTS WITH GHT H T THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK IS OFTEN STILL ACTIVE AT A VERY ROBUST LEVEL EVEN WHILE WE'RE TRYING TO ATTEND TO THINGS AND THAT'S WHY SOME ONEIT TH  D H T WILL SIT DOWN AND TRY AND DO SOME FOCUSED WORK AND I'LL START THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING THEY WANT OR SOMETHING THEY DISLIKE THEIR INTERNAL STATE WILL START TO DISTRACT THEM AND OF COURSE THERE ARE OTHER NETWORKS IN THE BRAIN THERE'S A SH A WHAT'S CALL THE TRUE SALIENT'S NETWORK THERE'S THE DORSAL ATTENTION NETWORK THERE ARE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT NETWORKS IN BRAIN AREAS BUT AGAIN WHEN THINKING ABOUT GHT H T AND ESPECIALLY WHEN THINKING ABOUT HOW THE DRUGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TO DAY WORK TO ALLEVIATE THE SYMPTOMS OF EGHTY HT AND IN THINKING ABOUT WHY SO MANY PEOPLE USE OR EVEN ABUSE THESE DRUGS FOR SAKE OF LEARNING OR RECREATIONALLY WE MIGHT SAY YOU START TO REALIZE THAT EVERYTHING CENTRS BACK TO THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX AND THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX'S ABILITY TO ACTIVELY SUPPRESS AND ACTIVELY ENHANCE THE ACTIVITY OF THESE MULTIPLE BRAIN NETWORKS INCLUDING DEFAULTMO NETWORK SALIENTS NETWORK DORSAL ATTENTION NETWORK ET CETERA SO RATHER THAN OVERWHELM YOU WITH A BUNCH OF NAMES OF BRAIN AREAS AND BRAIN NETWORKS TO DAY I'D REALLY LIKE OUR DISCUSSION TO FOCUS ON FIRST WHAT THE VARIOUS DRUGS THAT ARE USED TO TREAT EIGHTY EIGHT ARE THAT IS HOW DO THEY WORK AT THE LEVEL OF NURONS SECOND HOW THEY CREATE A CERTAIN SET OF CONDITIONS THAT ALLOW THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX TO BE A BETTER CONDUCTOR THIRD HOW THAT CAN BE LEVERAGE DURING DEVELOPMENT TO ACTUALLY TEACH THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX OF A YOUNG CHILD TO LEARN TO BE A BETTER CONDUCTOR BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY THE HALLMARK OF THE USE OF THESE DRUGS IS TO TRY AND ENHANCE THE ACTIVITY OF PARTICULAR CIRCUITS TO CREATE A SORT OF LEARNING SO THAT THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX IS MUCH MORE EFFICIENT AT DOING ITS JOB OF CONDUCTING AND THEN FORTH WE'RE GING TO TALK ABOUT THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE OUT THERE ASK ABOUT WHEN THEY HEAR ABOUT DRUGS LIKE ATARALL VIVANS AND RIDDLIN ET CETERA WHICH IS YU ARE THEY ADDICTIVE WHY ARE THEY ADDICTIVE CAN ONE USE THEM BRIEFLY OR EVEN FROM TIME TO TIME AND STILL BE O KA WHAT IF I USE THEM AS A CHILD AND I DON'T WANT TO BE ON THEM ANY MORE SHOULD I PUT MY CHILD ON THESE RUGS ET CETERA IT IS I BELIEVE ONLY BY UNDERSTANDING THE BIOLOGY OF HOW THESE DRGS WORK AND THEIR POTENTIAL BOTH TO IMPROVE BRAIN FUNCTION BUT ALSO SOME OF THE DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DRUGS THAT ONE CAN REALLY ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS FOR THEMSELVES OR FOR THEIR CHILDRA O CA SO LET'S START WITH A VERY BASIC BUT CRITICAL QUESTION WHICH IS WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD EMPHETAMINES S FEED OR OTHER STIMULANTS IMPROVE THE SYMPTEMS OF ADI T THAT'S SO CRITICAL TO ANSWER BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE PREFRONTAL QUARTECS NEEDS TO CORDINATE THE ACTIONS OF THESE OTHER CIRCUTS AND SO JUST INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF ACTIVITY IN PREFRONTAL QUARTECS YOU CAN IMAGIN WOULD CREATE A STATE OF HYPERFOCUS PERHAPS BUT ACTUALY THAT'S NOT THE CASE IF YOU JUST WERE TO RAMP UP THE ACTIVITY OF PREFRONTAL QUARTECS WHAT YOU WOULD FIND IS THAT SOMEBODY WOULD BECOME EVEN LESS EFFICIENT AT PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY WANTED TO RATHER THEY WOULD PAY ATTENTION TO WHATEVER WAS PRESENTED IN FRONT OF THEM WITH LAZER FOCUS THEY WOULD LOCK ON TO ASSENTIALLY ANYTHING AND THAT'S NOT GOOD ONE OF THE KEYTHINGS ABOUT PREFONTAL QUARTEC IS THAT IT NEEDS TO BE FLEXIBLE IT NEEDS BE ABLE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THIS THAN IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT THAN IT NEEDS GO BACK TO PAYNG ATTENTION TO THE THING IT WAS PAYING ATTENTION TO PREVIOUSLY AND SO ON AND SO FORTH LIFE THAT IS AN EFFECTIVE ADAPTIVE LIFE A GOOD LIFE CONSISTS OF SELF DIRECTING ONE'S ATTENTION MOST ALL OF THE TIME SO WHY WOULD STIMULANTS DO THAT WELL ALMOST ALL NOT ALL BUT ALMOST ALL OF THE DRUGS USED TO TREAT ADI T FALL UNDER THE CATEGORY OF STIMULANTS OR WHAT ARE CALLED SYMPATHOMIMETICS SYMPATHOMIMETIC REFERS TO THE FACT THAT WE NATURALLY HAVE A COMPONENT OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM CALLED THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM HAS TWO MAJOR COMPONENTS ONE IS CALLED THE SYMPATHETIC ARM OF THE AUNONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM HAS NOTHING TO A SYMPATHY HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH RAMPING UP OUR LEVEL OF ATTENTION AND AROUSAL IT IS THE SO CALLED FIGHT OR FLIGHT ASPECT OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM OR RATHER MEDIATES FIGHT OR FLIGHT BUT IMMEDIATES A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS TOO INCLUDING SEXUAL AROUSAL INCLUDING EXCITEMENT AND FOCUS ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO LEARN OR SOMEBODY THAT WE WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT OR REMEMBERING A PHONE NUMBER OR ANYTHING THAT PUTS US INTO A STATE OF ALERTNESS AND FOCUS THE OTHER ARM OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS THE SO CALLED PARI SYMPATHETIC ARM OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THAT'S OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THA SO CALLED REST IN DIGEST COMPONENT OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND YES IT CONTROLS REST INDEED IT PUTS US INTO SLEEP AND YETH IT'S INVOLVED IN DIGESTION BUT IT'S INVOLVED IN A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS AS WELL INCLUDING SEXUAL ROUSAL INCLUDING RATES OF DIGESTION INCLUDING SALEVATION INCLUDING ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT DON'T JUST HAVE TO DO WITH RESTING IN DIGESTING THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS ITS A SORT OF SEA SAW SO IT'S ALWAYS AT A BALANCE SOME PLACE BETWEEN EITHER PREDOMINANTLY SYMPATHETIC OR PREDOMINANTLY PARI SYMPATHETIC BUT BOTH THE PARI SYMPATHETIC AND THE SYMPATHETIC ARMS OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ARE ALWAYS ACTIVE ALL THE TIME IT'S NOT AS IF ONE IS COMPLETELY ACTIVE IN THE OTHERS SHUT OFF EVEN IN SLEEP YOUR SYMPAHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS NOT COMPLETELY TURNED OFF AND EVEN DURING A PANIC ATTACK YOUR PARI SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS NOT COMPLETELY TURNED OFF DRUGS TO TREAT EIGHTY HST WHICH ARE FALL UNDER THE CATEGORY OF STIMULANTS ARE SYMPATHOMEMETICS BECAUSE THEY TRIGGER THE RELEASE OF NEROCHEMICALS AND THE ACTIVATION OF COMPONENTS OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT VERY MUCH RESEMBLE THE ACTIVATION OF THE SO CALLED SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THE ONE THAT MAKES US MORE ALERT AND MORE AROUSED SO THAT'S WHY THER CALLED SYMPATHEMEMETICS AND THE WORD STIMULANT REFERS TO A GENERAL CATEGORY OF DRUGS THAT ARE SYMPATHEMEMETICS NOW THE MOST COMMONLY DISCUSTS SYMPATHEMEMEIC IS ONE THAT FORTUNATELY IS NOT PRESCRIBE FOR EIGHTY EIGHST AND THAT'S METHEMPHEDAMINE THESE DAYS WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT METH METH WHICH IS METHELATED AMPHEDAMINE IS AN EXTREMELY POTENT SYMPATHEMEMETIC AND IT HAS TREMENDOUS ABUSE POTENTIAL BELIEVE IT ARE NOT METH OR METHEMPHEDAMINE IS ACTUALLY OF AILABLE AS A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BUT IT IS USED VERY RARELY BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH ABUSED POTENTIAL AND ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS THAT IT CAN DO IN TERMS OF CARTIOVASCULAR HEALTH IN TERMS OF EARL HEALTH RIGHT THERE'S THE STEREOTYPE THAT METHEWSERS HAVE VERY DEGRADED TEETH AND INDEED THEY DO THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT RELATED TO HALMETH IMPACTS THE BRAIN AND BODY I'M GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT METHEM PHEDAMING A WILL BIT LATER BUT LES JUST PLACE METHEMPHEDAMING HIGH ON THE SHELF AS THE MOST POTENT SYMPATHEMEMETIC THAT'S OUT THERE BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT OFTEN PRESCRIBED FOR EIGHTY EIGH T THERE ARE CLASS OF COMPOUNDS VERY SIMILAR TO IT THAT HAVE A VERY SIMILAR PATTERN OF ACTION THAT IS NOT QUITE AS POTENT BUT THAT LEVERAGES THE SAME UNDERLYING MECHANISMS AND THEY ARE VERY COMMONLY PRESCRIBED FOR EIGHTY EIGHTST NAMELY ADERAL AND VIVEANTS SO FIRSTLETTS TALK ABOUT ADERAL AND WHAT ADERAL IS ADERAL IS A COMMINATION OF WHAT ARE CALLED MHEDAMING SALTS ANPHEDAMING SALTS REFERS TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE TWO MAJOR FORMS OF AMPHEDAMING THERE IS A D M PHEDAMING ARE DEXTERUM PHEDAMING AND LEVO N PHEAMING OR L MPHEDAMING SO I'LL REFER TO THESE AS D AND L M PHEDAMING AND FOR YU CHEMISTRY MINDED FOLKS OUT THERERE THE D AND THE L ALSO REFERRED TO THE FACT THAT THERE IS A L LEFT HANDED VERSION OF THE MOLECULE AND THERE'S A D OR RIGHT HANDED VERSION OF THE MOLECULE THIS IS ONLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND IN SO FAR AS YOU KNOW THAT THE D AND THE L FORMS OF THE MOLECULE LOOK VERY SIMILAR BUT THEY'RE MIRROR IMAGES OF ONE ANOTHER AND YET THEY CAN HAVE VERY DIFFERENT ACTIONS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY SO ADERALL IS A THREE TO ONE RATIO OF D M PHEDAMING TO L M PHEDAMING YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT L M PHEDAMING TENDS TO B LESS POTENT IN INCREASING CERTAIN ARECHEMICALS IN THE BRAIN ALL TALK ABOUT WHICH NOR CHEMICALS TE ARE IN A MOMENT THEN IS D M PHEDAMING SO D MPHEDAMING AS POTENT STUFF NOT AS POTENT IS METHEMPHEDAMINE BUT VERY POTENT STUFF ELEMPHEDAMINE ELOBET LESS POTENT ELEMPHEDEMINE TENDS TO BE THE MPHEDEMINE THAT INCREASE HIS BLOOD PRESSURE AN HEART RATE WHALE WE CALL PERIFERAL EFFECTS BECAUSE IT HAPPENS IN THE PERFERY OUTSIDE THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM PERIFERAL EFFECTS LIKE INCREASED HEART RAID INCREASE BLOOD PRESSURE SWEATING ET CETERA ARE MOSTLY ACTIVATED BY ELEMPHEDEMINE WHEREAS D MPHEDAMINE TENDS TO WORK MAINLY ON RECEPTORS IN THE BRAIN AND THEREFORE HAVE EFFECTS MAINLY RESTRICTED TO THE BRAIN NOW WHAT ARE TESE EFFECTS THAT I'VE BEEN REFERRING TO THE MAJOR EFFECT OF ADERALE AND OTHER SYMPATHEMAMETIC STIMULANTS IS TO INCREASE THE ACTIVITY OF TWO NORCHEMICALS THE FIRST OF THOSE NEUROCHEMICALS IS DOPAMINE AND THE OTHER OF THOSE NAURO CHEMICALS IS NOR EPINEFREN FIRST OFF I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WHEN I SAY NOR EPINEFREN I COULD JUST AS EASILY SAY NOR A DRENALINE BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE EXACT SAME THING AND FORGIVE ME EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T THE ONE TO NAME THE SAME THING TO DIFFERENT THINGS I'LL TRY AND STAY WITH NOR EPINEFREN BUT I MAY SAY NOR DRENALANE THEY ARE THE SAME THING THE WHOLE STORY IS TO HOW THEY GOT NAMED TWO DIFFERENT THINGS BUT IT'S THE SAME THING THE MAJOR EFFECT OF ADERALL AND OTHER SYMPATHEMAMETIC STIMULANTS IS TO INCREASE THE TRANSMISSION OF DOPAMINE AND NOR EPINEFREN SO WHAT IS DOPAMINE AND WHAT IS NARAPINEFREN WHELE BOTH DOPAMINE AND NORIPANEFREN ARE WHAT ARE CALLED NOROMODULATORS THAT IS THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO INCREASE OR DECREASE THE FIRING PATTERNS THE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY OF PARTICULAR BRAIN CIRCUITS BOTH DOAMINE AND NOREPINEFREN HAVE SEPARATE ROLES IN CREATING CERTAIN STATES WITHIN OUR BRAIN AND BODY BUT THEY LIKE TO COLLABORATE MEANING THEY TEND TO BE RELEASED AT SIMILAR LOCATIONS IN THE BRAIN IN ORDER TO DELIVER US TO A PARTICULAR STATE OF MIND AND ERE BODY SO IF WE WERE TO TAKE A LOOK AT JUST DOPOMINE WE WOULD FIND THAT DOPOMINE IS RELEASED AT SIGHTS WITHIN THE BRAIN AND INCREASES THE ACTIVITY OF BRAIN NETWORKS THAT FOR THE MOST PART LEAD TO INCREASES IN MOTIVATION PURSUIT AND TO SOME EXTENT MOOD IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT NORAPINEFREN AND WHERE ITS RELEASED IN THE BRAIN IT TENDS TO BE RELEASED AT MANY NOT ALL BUT MANY OF THE SAME SIGHTS WHERE DOPOMINE IS RELEASED AND THE MAIN FUNCTION OF NORAP INEFREN IS TO INCREASE THE ACTIVITY OF NERAL NETWORKS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN ATTENTION AND FOCUS TO PARTICULAR THINGS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT ISO THINK OF DOPOMINE AND NORAP INEFREN AS COLLABORATORS BECAUSE INDEED THEY ARE AND ACTUALLY THEIRE VERY NOR CHEMICALLY SIMILAR AS WELL IT ACTUALY JUST TAKES ONE CHEMICAL CONVERSION TO TURNDOPOMINE INTO NORAPANEFEREN SO THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR TO LIKE CLOSE COUSINS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO HELP US ACHIEVE A COMMON GOAL THAT INVOLVES INCREASED MOTIVATION FOCUS AND ALERTNESS SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ATTENTION IN EIGHTY EIGHTSTY OR WE TALK ABOUT QUIETING THE HYPER ACTIVITY OR IMPULSIVITY OF EIGHTY EIGHSTY ONE OF THE REASONS WHY DRUGS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE INTREATING EIGHTY EIGHTTY ARE SO EFFECTIVE IS BECAUSE THEY INCREASE MOTIVATION FOCUS AND ALERTNESS AND THEY TEND TO DO THAT AT VERY FOCAL LOCATIONS IN THE BRAIN IT'S WORTH TAKING A COUPLE OF MINUTES TO THINK ABOUT HOUSEYMPATHEMAMETIC SUCH AS ATER ALL ACTUALLY INCREASE DOPOMINE AND NORAPANEFEREN THEY DO SO BY EFFECTING A COUPLE OF SPECIFIC OPERATIONS AT THE SOCALLED SYNAPS WHAT ARE SYNAPSES SYNAPSES ARE THE COMMUNICATION POINTS BETWEEN NURONS THEIRE ACTUALLY THE SPACES BETWEEN NURONS BUT THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE ACTION IS WHEN NURONS AS WE SAY ARE STIMULATING THE NEXT NURONOR ACTIVATING THE NEXT NURONOR INHIBITING THE NEXT NURON THE WORD NURON JUST SIMPLY REFERS TO NERVE SCELL AND SO WHAT NERVE CELLS HAVE AS THEY HAVE A CELL BODY THAT CONTAINS THEIR DIENA AND A BUNCH OF OTHER STUFF THEY HAVE A LONG WIRELIKE PROS US WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS AN ACS ON AND AT THE END OF THAT ACTS ON THERE ARE BUNCH OFPROTINES IN THERE THAT DO REALLY INTERESTING THINGS SO FOR INSTANCE THERE ARE PROTINES DOWN AT THE END OF THE ACTS ON THAT PACKAGE NAURO TRANSMITTER INTO LITTLE SPHERICAL THINGS THAT WE CALL VESICALS THOSE VESICALS CONFUSE WITH THE END OF THE ACTS ON AND PAH VOMIT THE CONTENTS THOSE NARRO TRANSMITTERS INTO THE SYNAPTIC CLAFT INTO THAT LITTLE SPACE BETWEEN NURONS AND THEN IF ENOUGH OF THOSE NAURO TRANSMITTERS BIND TO RECEPTORS ON WHAT'S CALLED THE POSYNAPTIC SIDE WHICH SIMPLY MEANS THE NURON ON THE OTHER SIDE WELL THEN THE NEXTNERON WILL BECOME ACTIVE AND THAN THE SIGNAL WILL PROPAGATE FROM ONE NURON TO THE NAXT NOW I JUST DESCRIBE THAT WHOLE PROCESS PRETTY QUICKLY AND I LIKE TO THINK PRETTY SIMPLY BUT IT ACTION INVOLVES A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROTINE BITS AND SOME PRETTY COMPLEX MACHINERY IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN I DON'T WANT TO OVER COMPLICATE OUR CONVERSATION BUT WHAT I WILL TELL YOU IS THAT DOWN IN THE SYNAPS IN THE PRIESEYNAPTIC TERMINAL THE NURON THAT IS GOING TO RELEASE NOR TRANSMITTER THERE ARE WHAT TO CALLED TRANSPORTERS WHICH SIT THERE AND OH SUCK UP OR SUCK BACK UP SOME OF THE NURO TRANSMITTER THAT'S BEEN RELEASED THERE ARE DOPOMINE TRANSPORTERS AND THERE ARE NOREPANEFREN AR NOR ADRONERGIC TRANSPORTERS DOWN IN THE SYNAPS WHAT ADERAL DOES AND WHAT OTHER SYMPATHEMEMETICS DO IT IS TO INHIBIT OR DISERRUPT THE ACTION OF THOSE TRANSPORTERS AND THE NET CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS THAT WHEN DOPOMINE AND NOR EPINEFRAN ARE RELEASED INTO THE SYNAPS MORE OF IT IS ALLOWED TO STICK AROUND AND TO BIND A RECEPTORS ON THE POSTSONAPTIC CELL THEN WOULD BE THE CASE IF ADERAL OR THE OTHER STIMULANT WERE NOT PRESENT IN THE SYSTEM SO ONE WAY THAT ADERAL INCREASES DOPOMINE AND NORAPINEFRON IS BY DISERRUPTING THE ACTIVITY OF THESE PRESYNAPTIC TRANSPORTERS FOR DOPAMINE AND NORPANEFREN THE OTHER WAY THAT ADERALL INCREASES DOPAMINE AD NORAPANEFREN IS THAT IT D ESERRUPTS THE ACTIVITY OF A DIFFERENT PIECE OF MACHINERY IN THE PRESENAPTIC NURON WHICH IS CALLED A VEMAT THE VESICAL MONOIMINE TRANSPORTER TO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET SPECIFIC YOU DON'T HAVE TO REMEMBER THESE NAMES BUT WHAT THESE VEMATS DO AS ACTUALLY REALLY COOL WHAT THEY DO IS THEY ACTUALLY TAKE WHATEVER TRANSMITTER HAS BEEN BROUGHT BACK UP INTO THE CELL BY TRANSPORTERS AND THEY PACKAGE IT INTO THOSE VESICLES THAT ARE THEN GOING TO BE RELEASED BY DESRUPTING THE TRANSPORTERS THAT VACUME BACK UP SOME OF THE DOPAMINE OR NORAPANFRAN THAT'S BEEN RELEASED AND BY ALSO DESTRUPTING THE PACKAGING OF DOPOMIN AND NORAPANEFRAN INTO VESICLES THEMSELVES WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS THAT THEREIS A BUILD UP OF A LOT MORE DOPAOMINE AND NORAPANEFRN IN THE PRESENAPTIC TURMINAL SO THAT WHEN AN ELECTRICAL SIGNAL TRAVELS DOWN THA NURON NOW THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DOPAMINE AND NORAPANEFRONETS RELEASED IS INCREASED OKISO WHAT'S HAPPENING WHEN YOU TAKE ADERALL IS THAT YOU'RE GETTING MORE OUT OF THE DOPOMINE AND NORAPANFRON THAT YOU'RE RELEASING AND YOUR RELEASING MORE DOPOMINE AND NORAPANEFRAN ALTOGETHER AND THERE'S A THIRD MECHANISM BY WHICH ADERALL INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF DOPAMINE AND NORPANEFRAN PRESENT INSINAPSES AND THEREFORE CANACT ON OTHER NURONS AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH DESTRUPTION OF THE ENTIRE NETWORK BETWEEN THESE DIFFERENT PROTINES NOT GOING TO GO INTO THAT IN ANY DETAIL BECAUSE IT GET SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED IN TERMS OF THE CELLBIOLOGY AND SOME OF THE BIO CHEMISTRY DOWN AT THE TIPS OF THESE AXONS BUT SUFFICE TO SAY THAT ADARALL IS SUCH AN EFFECTIVE SYMPATHEMAMETIC THAT IS IT CAN INCREASE DOPOMINE TO SUCH A GREAT EXTENT SPECIALLY COMPARED TO OTHER TREATMENTS FRADIATY BECAUSE OF ITS ABILITY TO INCREASE DOPOMINE RELEASE AND TRANSMISSION AND THEREFORE ACTION AS WELL AS NORADRNERGIC RELEASE AND TRANSMISSION AND ACTION DOWN THERE IN THE SENAPS AND IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT THAT MOST OF THE EFFECT OF ATERALL IS IN INCREASING DOPOMINE AS APPOSE TO NOR AP AN EFRN IT DOES INCREASE NORUP IN EFFRON BUT IT'S MAJOR EFFECTS WE SHOULD SAY THE MAJOR EFFECTS THAT HAVE MADE IT SUCH AN ATTRACTIVE DRUG TO SO MANY PEOPLE BOTH FOR THE TREATMENT OF HT H D AND FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE RECREATIONALLY OR OFF PRESCRIPTION OR FOR SAKE OF STUDYING OR WORK SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WANT TO FOCUS MORE AND LONGER IS BECAUSE OF ITS ABILITY TO INCREASE DOPAMINE TO SUCH A GREAT EXTENT I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED  G ONE IS A VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS I'VE EEN TAKING ATHLETIC GRENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO ME THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GOT IS VERY IMPORTANT AS POPULATED BY GUP MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE MUN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIOTICS AN ATHLETIC GRENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLTIC GREENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTEGINS VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTESGRIPT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD IN THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEARS SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THRE K TWO AGAIN THAT'S ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEARS SUPPLY O VITEMEND THREE K TO NOW A BIT EARLIER I MENTION THAT L M PEDAMIN LEVO AND FEDAMNE IS PRESENT IN ATERALL BUT AT ONE QUARTER THE AMOUNT OF D M PHEDEMI CAUSE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF ELUMPHEDEMINE AND A LOT OF D M HEDEMINE IN ATERALL MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH VIVANTS VIVANTS IS A COMMERCIAL NAME FOR WHAT MANY PEOPLE THINK IS EXTENDED RELEASE ADERAL BUT ACTURIVIVANTS IS NOT EXTENDED RELEASE ADERAL VIVANTS IS A DRUG IN WHICH THE PARMACUITACALE INDUSTRY HAS TAKEN ONE COMPONENT OF ADERAL JUST THE D MPHEDAMINE COMPONENT AN ATTACHED TO IT AN EMENOACID CALLED LICINE NOW THE EMENOACID LICINE IS A BIGAMINO ACID AND THE ATTACHING OF LICINE TO D MPHEDAMIN WHAT WE CALL VIVANTS MAKES IT WHAT'S CALLED A PRODRUG IT ACTUALLY CAN'T HAVE ANY EFFECT ON ITS OWN BUT WHEN ONE TAKES VIVANTS AND IT'S BROKEN DOWN IN THE GUT BUT TO A GREATER EXTENT ACTUAY IN THE BLOOD STRIME THE LICINES ARE CLEAVED OFF SLOWLY OVER TIME AND AS A CONSEQUENTS VIVANS IS BASICALLY TIMED RELEASE D MPHEDAMINE  THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT ADERAL WHICH AGAIN IS D MPHEDEMINE ND ELAMPHEDAMINE AND THOSE TWO THINGS OPERATE QUITE A BIT DIFFERENTLY AT THE LEVEL OF NOREPINEPRAN AND EPINEPRINAN CARDIAPERS IS BRAIN EFFECTS A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK VIVANS IS JUST SLOW RELEASE ADERAL BUT IT IS NOT WHAT VIVANTS IS IS I D MPHEDAMINE ONLY BUT IN TIME RELEASE FORM AND VIVANTS WAS ACTUALLY DEVELOPED AS AWAY TO TRY AND GET AROUND OR RATHER PREVENT SOME OF THE ABUSE PETENTIAL OF ADERAL AND OTHER DRUGS THAT CONTAIN D MHEDAMINE D M PHEDEMINE STANDS FOR DEXTRA AMPHEDAMINE AND IN THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES THERE WERE FAIR AMOUNT OF MOVIES AND THE WAS A LOT OF TRAFFICING AND THERE AS LOT OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY RELATED TO WHAT WAS CALLED DEXADRIE DEXADRINE IS PURE D M PHEDAMIE SO IF WE ARE GOING TO BE VERY DIRECT IF I WERE GOING TO JUST FRAME THESE THINGS IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR NEROCHEMISTRY WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT VIVANTS IS TIME RELEASE DEXDRINE IT'S NOT TIME RELEASE ADERAL NOW JUST BECAUSE THE REMOVIES AND REPORTS OF CRIMINICAL ACTIVITY RELATED TO DEXADRIME AT DOESN'T NESSERLY MNEAN THAT DEXADRINE IS NOT AND EFFECTIVE AND USEFUL PHARMASUTICLE IN FACT VIVANTS WHICH IS TIME RELEASE DEXEDRINE HAS PROVE TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN THE TREATMEN OF EIGHTY EIGHT SH FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THIS TIME RELEASE DOES INDEED PREVENT TOBUSE IN THE SENSET DESPITE PEOPLES MANY ATTEMPTS FROM WHAT I HEAR TO INCREASE THE RATE OF ENTRY OF THE D M PHEDAMINE INTO THEIR SYSTEM BY EITHER SNORTING IT OR  GONT FORBID EVEN INJECTING ANYTHINGS OF THAT SORT THE ATTACHING OF THAT LI SEEN TO D M PHEDAMINE REALLY DOES SLOW THE ABSORPTION SO WHEN SOMEBODY TAKES VIVANTS AND HOPFULLY PEOPLE ARE TAKING IT RESPONSIBLY WHEN THEY TAKE VIVEANTS WITH THEIRE REALLY GETTING IS A SLOW TRICKLE OF D MPHEDAMINE INTO THEIR SYSTEM AND THEREFORE A SLOW LONG LASTING INCREASE IN DOPOMINE A NORUP AND EFRAND AND INDEED THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS THE EFFECTS OF VIVANTS CAN EXTEND OVER ANYWHERE FROM TWELVE TO SIXTEEN SOMETIMES EVEN EIGHTEEN HOURS DEPENDING ON HOW QUICKLY SOMEBODY METABOLIZES IT AND I SHOULD SAY THAT THERE IS NO AID TO PREDICT HOW QUICKLY ONE WILL METABOLIZE ANY OF THESE DRUGS EXCEPT BY TRYING THEM THAT'S ONE OF THE OR DOWNSIDES OF THE STATE OF THINGS THESE DAYS THERE'S NO BLOOD TEST OR INSEMATIC TESTS THAT WILL TELL YOU WHETHE OR NOT YOU'REGING TO BE A PHACMETABOLIZER A SLOW METABOLZER AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE JUST HAVE TO SORT THROUGH DIFFERENT DOSAGES WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT IN WILL BIT THEY HAVE TO SORT THROUGH DIFFERENT TYPES OF SYMPATHEMEMATICS YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE TRY ATERALL ANDTHEY FIND THAT YOUOH THE QUICK TIME COURSE OF ATER ALL AT LEAST QUICK FOR THEM OF ABOUT SIX TO EIGHT HOURS IS JUST TOO FAST AND THEN IT WEARS OFF AND THEY GET INTO A SLUMP IN THE AFTERNOON OTHER PEOPLE FIND THAT ONE ATERALL TAKEN IT SIX A M WILL HAVE THEM GOING ALL DAY LONG AND INTO THE NIGHT AND ITS JUST TOO MUCH STIMULATION AND THEY NEED TO COME WAYWAY DOWN IN DOSE OR THEY NEED TO THINK ABOUT OTHER SYMPATHEMEMATICS FORADIATE T WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT SOME OF THOSE OTHER OPTIONS ARE AND WILL BIT AS WELL SO THE IMPORTANTING T UNDERSTAND IS THAT ATERALL IS REALLY TWO DRUGS D AND EL M PHEDAMINE VIVEANTS IS D M PHEDAMINE WHICH IS ALSO CALLED DEXODRINE BUT WITH THIS TIME RELEASED ASPECT CREATED BY LUMPING LICINE ON THERE AND YOU MAY NOTICE THAT I HAVEN'T MENTIONED ONE OF THE MAJOR DRUGS USED TO TREAT EIGHTY EIGHST AND THAT'S RIDDALAN OR WHAT SOMETIMES ALSO CALLED CONSERTA A DEPENDING ON AGAIN THE TIME RELEASE FORMS ET CETERA RIDDALAND WAS VERY COMMONLY PRESCRIBED FOR THE TREATMENT OF EIGHTY EIGHST EARLY IN THE DAYS OF USING SYMPATHEMEMETICS IN ORDER TO TREAT EIGHTY EIHST SO FOR INSTANCE I WENT TO COLLEGE IN THE EARLY NINETIES I STARTED COLLEGE IN NINETY THREE AND I GRADUATE NINETY EIGHT WAS ONE YEAR AND THERE AS A ET'S CALLED A TRANSITIONEAR I CAN RECALL HEARING THAT RIDDLAND WAS BEING PRESCRIBED FOR EIGHTY EIGHST IN KIDS AND I LIKE MANY OTHER PEOPLE WERE WONDERING WHAT ARE THE LONG TRM CONSEQUENCES OF THIS GOING TO BE I ALSO LIKE MANY OTHER PEOPLE WAS VERY PERPLEXED AS TO WY A STIMULANT SYMPATHEMEMETIC LIKE RIDDALAN WAS BEING PERSCRIBED FOR HYPERACTIV KIDS THAT WILL BECOME CLEAR IN A MOMENT BUT WE DON'T HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT RIDDLAND NOWADAYS AND I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE ADERAL AND VIVANTS AND THINGS LIKE THEM HAVE BECOME SO POPULAR FOR THE TREATMENT OF EIGHTY EIGHST IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT RIDDALAND IS NOT ACTUALLY AMPHEDAMINE RIDDLAND IS WHAT'S CALLED METHELPHENADATE AND METHELPHENADATE WORKS IN A LOT OF WAYS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THE WAY THAT ADERAL AND VIVANTS WORK BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN WAYS IN WHICH ITS DIFFERENT NOW RIDDALAND METHELPHENADATE DOES INCREASED DOPOMIE TRANSMISSION AT SYNAPSIS AND IT DOES SO ALSO BY INHIBITING THE FUNCTION OF THAT PRESYNAPTIC DOPOMINE TRANSPORTER THAT WOULD OTHERWISE SUCK MORE DOPOMINE BACK UP INTO THE PRECENAPTIC CELL METHELPHENADATE RIDDALAN ALSO DISTRUPTS THE ACTIVITY OF THE NORAGERNERGIC TRANSPORTER LEADING TO NET INCREASES IN THE AMOUNT OF NORUPANEFRON AT THE SYNAPS BUT IT IS NOT AS MUCH A POTENT INHIBITER OF THE NORAGERNERGIC TRANSPORTER AND THEREFORE MOST OF THE EFFECT OF METHELPENADA IS TO INCREASE DOPOMINE AT SYN APSIS LOT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT THE LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT RIDDLAN IS JUST VERY SHORT ACTING ATERALL AND THAT'S NOT THE CASE IT IS TRUE THAT RIDDLAN AT LEAST IN ITS STANDARD FORM TENDS TO HAVE A PRETTY SHORT HALF LIFE AND THEREFORE IT'S EFFECTS BUTASICALLY KICK IN ABOUT TWENTY TO FORTY MINUTES AFTER TAKING IT SOMETIMES A LOBIT SOONER SOMETIMES A LITTLE LATER AND THEY LAST ABOUT FOUR TO SIX HOURS AS SUPPOSED TO THE SIX TO EIGHT HOURS TYPICAL OF ATERALL BUT RIDDLN IS NOT SHORT ACTING ATERAL RIDDLAN IS MAINLY INCREASING DOPOMINE AND TO SOME EXTENT NOR EPINEFRON AT SYNAPSES WERE AS ADERAL AND VIVEANTS ARE INCREASING BOTH DOPOMINE AND NOREPINEFRAN TO A MUCH GREATER EXTENT AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE INTERESTED IN THE UNDERLYING SELL BIOLOGICAL REASON FOR THAT IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH RIDDLAN'S RELATIVELY LOWER AFFINITY FOR THE NORAGERNERGIC TRANSPORTER BUT IT'S ALSO BECAUSE REMEMBER I LISTED OFF THREE MECHANISMS BY WHICH ATRALL AND BY EXTENSION VIVE ANTS INCREASE DOPOMINE AND NOREPINEFRAN TRANSMISSION RITE DESTRUCTION THE TRANSPORTER DESTRUPTION OF THE VEMAT TOO AS WELL AS A DESTRUPTION OF THE WHOLE KIND OF COMPLEX OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THOSE PROTINES WIL RIDDLAN IS REALLY ONLY TAPPING INTO THE DRUGSABILITY TO DESTRUPT THE DOPOMINE AND NORA ATRONERGIC TRANSPORTER SO IT'S THREE MECHANISMS OF INCREASING DOPOMINA NOREPINEFRAN FOR ADERLL AND VIVE ANTS AND BY EXTENSION DEXEDRIN AND IT'S ONLY ONE MECHANISM FOR RIDDLAN TO INCREASE DOPOMINE AND NOREPINEFRAN AND THEREIN MOSTLY DOPAOMINE SO IF WE TAKE A STEP BACK FOR A MOMENT FROM ALL THESE DRUGS IN ALL THIS CELBIOLOGY OF NORONS AND SO FORTH AND WE GO BACK TO THE BRAINNET WORKS INVOLVED IN ATTENTION MEMBER THE ORCHESTRA MOD OR THE TEACHER MODO WHERE THE PREFRONTAL QUARTAX REALLY SITS IN TOPSEAT IN TERMS OF CORDINATING THE ACTIONS BOTH THE SH THE QUIETING AND THE YES PLEASE SPEAK ACTIONS OF THE BRAIN REALLY BRINGING ABOUT WHAT WE THINK OF AS FOCUS ATTENTION AND TAST AGING ALL THE STUFF THAT GOES ALONG WITH LEARNING AND FOCUS AND COGNITION WELL WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT DOPOMINE AND NOR UP INEFEREN WHICH ARE DIFFERENTIALLY INCREASE BY THESE DIFFERENT DRUGS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALSO DIFFERENTIALLY IMPACT THE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF EXECUTIVE FUNCTION OF THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX INCREASING OUR ATTENTION FOR SPECIFIC THINGS AND WHILE THERE IS A LOT OF NUANTS IN THE LITERATURE ABOUT THIS WE CAN SAFELY SAY A COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST OF ALL INCREASING DOPOMINE AT PARTICULAR SYNAPS ES AND NETWORKS IN THE BRAIN CAN SERVE AS WHAT'S CALLED NOISE REDUCTION IT CAN HELP FURTHER ENHANCE THE QUIETING OF ALL THAT BACKGROUND STUFF THAT BACKGROUND STUFF CAN BE ATTENTION TO THINGS IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT LIKE NOISES OR VISUAL CUES IT COULD BE SOME INTERNAL NARRATIVE THATHAD ABOUT YESTERDAY OR SOMETHING THAT SOMEBODY SAID ABOUT YOU OR SOMETHING THAT SOMEBODY YOU LIKE WOULD LIKE TO SAY ABOUT YOU OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE THAT'S HAPPENING IN YOUR HEAD THAT'S DISTRACTING YOU AS WELL AS YOUR REPRESENTATION OF YOUR INTERNAL BODILY STATE WHAT WE CALL INTERROCEPTION THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF ATTENTION AN WE DON'T OFTEN HEAR ABOUT WHICH IS THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ATTEND TO THINGS OUTSIDE OF US WHICH IS CALLED EXTEROCEPTION AS WELL AS AN ABILITY TO ATTEND TO THINGS INSIDE OF US WHICH INCLUDE THINGS LIKE THOUGHTS BUT ALSO INCLUDES ON FOR INSTANCE HOW EMPTY OR FULL AR GUT FEELS WETHNOUT WERE COMFORTABLE IN OUR CHAIR YOUKNOWHN WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE PRACTICE OF FOCUS AND LEARNING OR FOCUS SING AS A VERB IT INVOLVES OFTEN FORCING OURSELVES TO SIT STILL IT OFTEN INVOLVES US SUPPRESSING THE FACT THAT OUR FOOT IS A LOBIT CRAMPED OR THAT WE MIGHT NEED TO USE THE RESTAURUM FOR YOU KNOW WE MIGHT WANT TO DELAY THAT FOR TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT BE FAIRLY URGENT ALL THESE SORTS OF THINGS ARE SENTIAL TO OUR ABILITY TO ATTEND AND FOCUS AND SO DOPAMINE WHILE IT DOES MANY DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE BRAIN MANY MANY DIFFERENT THINGS ONE OF ITS MAIN FUNCTIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THIS PREFRONTAL QUARTEX AND ATTENTION STUFF IS TO QUIET THE AMOUNT OF NOISE THAT IS IT HELPS THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX SUPPRESS THE SIGNALS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE DISTRACT US INTO THINKING ABOUT IAM CONATHERSTYRI NOW AR I NEEDTO USE THE RASTERUM I REALLY WANT O MAKE THIS COLLAR RELL REALLY WANT TO PICK UP MY PHONE ALL OF THAT STUFF ALL OF THAT SUPPRESSION THAT H THAT QUIDING DOWN OF ALL THE BACKGROUND CHATTER RELATED THE THINGS EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL TO US IN OUR HEAD AND OUR BODY IS GREATLY FACILITATED BY HAVING MORE DOPOMING PRESENT IN THE SCYNAPSES THAT ALLOW FOR WHAT WE CALL NOISE REDUCTION NOW IN PARALLEL TO THAT IS NOREP INEFREN NORP INEFRN IS RELEASED FROM MULTIPLE SIGTS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY BUT WITHIN THE BRAIN THERE'S ONE MAJOR SIT OF NERONS THAT MANUFACTURE NORUPIN EFREN AND THE NAME OF THAT SITE IS LOCUS SERULIUS ITSITS IN THE BACK OF THE BRAIN IT'S ICHAY A RELATIVELY SMALL COLLECTION OF NERONS BUT THEY ARE VERY VERY POWERFUL THEY EXTEND THEIR LILL AXONS THEIR WIRES TO MULTIPLE LOCATIONS IN THE BRAIN AND THEY RELEASE NORUP IN EFRAN AT THOSE LOCATIONS SO THINK OF THEM SORT IS A SPRINKLER SYSTEM THAT ORIGINATES FROM ONE VERY FOCAL LOCATION BUT THAT CAN SPRINKLE NOREP IN EFREN AT MULTIPLE LOCATIONS IN THE BRAIN AND THE AMAZING THING ABOUT LOCUSERULIUS AND THAT SPRINKLER SYSTEM IS THAT INDEED THE SPRINKLAR SYSTEM CAN BE PRETTY WIDESPREAD WHERE EVERYWHERE THERE'S A SPRINKLER HEAD SOMEBODY'S GETTING NORUP INEFREN BUT IT ALSO CAN FAIRLY FOCALLY RELEASE NOREPIN EFRN AT PARTICULAR SIHTS SO WHILE IN THE CONTETS OF DEDAYS DISCUSSION DOPOMINE IS ACTING LARGELY TO IMPART NOISE REDUCTION NOREP INEFREN HAS THE ABILITY TO BOOST SIGNALS AT SINAPSES TO INCREASE THE AMPLITUDE AND FREQUENCY OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN NURONS AND IN THAT WAY IN THE CONTEXTS OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION NORUP INEF RAN WHEN RELEASED AT THE PARTICULAR SYNAPSES IN THE PARTICULAR BRAINNET WORKS THAT ARE RELATED TO ATTENTION AND LEARNING IS LARGELY SERVING TO INCREASE SIGNAL SO WHAT WE HAVE IN THE CONTECTS OF A DRUG LIKE ATERALL OR VIVANTS OR TO SOME EXTENT METHELPENIDATE RIDDLAND DOES US AS WELL IS AN INCREASE IN DOPOMINE AND NEURAPINEFREN THAT IS LEADING TO TWO THINGS BUT THE REDUCTION IN NOISE A QUIETING OF THE CIRCUITRY THAT WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR SO MUCH FROM AND IN INCREASE IN THE SIGNAL OF THE NETWORKS THAT WE DO WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO AND THE NET EFFECT OF THAT NOISE REDUCTION AND SIGNAL AMPLIFICATION IS WHAT THE ENGINEERS REFER TO AS INCREASED SIGNAL TO NOISE AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS A HEIGHTENED SUBJECTIVE SENSE OR ABILITY TO DECIDE WHAT WE WANT A FOCUS ON SIT DOWN OR STAND THERE AND JUST FOCUS ON IT SO THE WAY THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING DRUGS TO TREAT EIGHTY HT AND THEIR ABILITY TO INCREASE DOPOMINE AND NORAPINEFRON AND THEREBY TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF NOISE SO TO SPEAK IN THE BRAIN AND TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SIGNAL RELATED TO THINGS THAT WE WANT TO ATTEND TO ALL PRESUMES THAT THE AMOUNT OF DOPOMINE AND THE AMOUNT OF NORAPANEFRON THAT'S BEING INCREASED IS PERFECT FOR WHAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH WHICH IS INCREASED FOCUS AND REDUCED HYPER ACTIVITY AND IMPULSIVITY BUT OF COURSE IN THE REAL WORLD THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE DEPENDING ON THE DOSAGE OF THE DRUG ONE SENSITIVITY TO THE DRUG EVEN WHAT STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN A PERSON IS AT THINGS CAN REALLY GO HEYWIRE PRETTY FAST AND WHEN I'M REFERRING TO WHEN I SAY HEYWIRE IS YOU THINK ABOUT DOPOMINE AND ITS ABILITY TO REDUCE NOISE WELL DOPOMINE DOES A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS AS WELL AND IN FACT WE KNOW THAT IF DOPOMIN IS INCREASED TOO MUCH IN THE BRAIN OF SOMEBODY THAT HAS EIGHTY HTY OR SOMEBODY THAT DOESN'T HAVE EIGHTY HTY PEOPLE CAN BECOME EUPHORIC PEOPLE CAN BECOMEMANIC PEOPLE CAN EVEN BECOME PSYCHOTIC LIKEWISE IF NORAPINEFRON IS INCREASED TOO MUCH PEOPLE WON'T JUST BECOME ALERT THEY WILL BECOME VERY ANXIOUS HAVE PANIC ATTACKS AND DEPENDING ON THE DRUG THEIR TAKING THEY MAY EVEN EXPERIENCE VERY SERIOUS PERFERAL SYMPTOMS MEANING ELEVATED HEART RATE AND SWEATING THAT IT'S SUPERUNCOMFORTABLE AND ON AND ON SO EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN DISCUSSING UP UNTIL NOW IS TRUE BUT I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IT'S TRUE IN THE CONTEXTS OF APPROPRIATELY DOSED PRESCRIBED DRUG FOR A GIVEN CONDITION WHICH LEADS US TO THE NEXT QUESTION WHICH IS WHY WOULD IT BE THAT GIVING THESE DRUGS WHICH ARE IN FACT STIMULANTS WHY WOULD THAT CALM AKID DOWN WHY WOULD THAT COMMON ADULT WITH HT H T DOWN AND THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NOT COMPLETELY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND IT IS WORTH POINTING OUT THAT NOT EVERY ONE WITH EGHT H T HAS IMPULSIVITY AND HYPERACTIVITY AND THEREFORE AND INABILITY TO FOCUS SOME KIDS AND ADULTS WITH EHT H T DO HAVE CHALLENGES WITH IMPULSIVITY AND HYPERACTIVITY SOME DO NOT SOME JUST HAVE CHALLENGES WITH FOCUS AND I DIDN'T ENTIRE EPISODE ABOUT GHT H T AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN EXPERT GUESSED ON THIS PODCAST WHO SPECIALIZES IN THE TREATMENT OF EGHTY H TY TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES FURTHER BUT I JUST WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT AS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH HTY HT ARE CAPABLE OF VERY CONCENTRATED PERIODS OF FOCUS THE PATTERN HOWEVER TENDS TO BY THAT CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH GHTY HT HAVE A HARDER TIME GETTING INTO THAT STATE OF FOCUS AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY THEY HAVE A VERY HARD TIME GETTING INTO A FORCED STATE OF FOCUS FOR THINGS THAT THEY DON'T ENJOY DOING I'M SURE MANY OF YOU HLSOTHINGING WAIT I DON'T LIKE TO DO CERTAIN THINGS THENTS HARDER TO FOCUS ON THOSE THINGS THAN ON THE THINGS I LIKE OF COURSE DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE EGHT H T AN ANSWER IS NOT NECESSARILY SO KIDS AND ADULTS WITH EHTY HT EXHIBIT AN EXTREME VARIATION IN THEIR ABILITY TO FOCUS SUCH THAT IF THERE'S SOMETHING THEY REALLY REALLY LIKE DOING THEY CAN INDEED FOCUS HOWEVER FOR MANY MANY OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT ARE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO DEVELOP I GUESS WHILL JUST CALL IT NORMAL LIFE ADVANCEMENT SO SITTING STILL LISTENING TO CONVERSATIONS THAT WE MAYR MAY NOT BE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THAT'S WHERE THE CHALLENGES COME ABOUT SO THE POINT IS AT THESE BRAIN NETWORKS AND THESE NORMODULATORS LIKE DOPEMING IN NORP ANDEFFRON THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IN FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD TERMS AS IT RELATES TO A DRUGS ABILITY TO CREASE THEIR TRANSMISSION AND THEREFORE AN IMPROVED ABILITY OF FOCUS PRESUMES TWO THINGS IT PRESUMES THAT THE DOSING IS RIGHT THAT IS THAT THE LEVELS OF INCREASES IN THESE NORMODULATORS IS JUST RIGHT AND I ALSO JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT EIGHTY EIGHT IS FIRST OF ALT NOT IN INABILITY TO FOCUS AT ALL IT IS IMMENSE CHALLENGES IN FOCUSING ON LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS AS REQUIRED FOR NORMAL LIFE PROGRESSION AND IT'S ALSO THE CASE THAT THERE IS NO ONE SPECIFIC PATTERN OF EIGHTY HT THAT APPLIES TO EVERY ONE WITH EIGHTY H SOME PEOPLE BOTH KIDS AND ADULTS WILL EXHIBIT THE HYPERACTIVITY BUT NOT THE IMPULSIVITY ALTHOUGH THOSE TWO THINGS TEND TO GO HAND IN HAND SOME PEOPLE IL HAVE A CHALLENGE IN FOCUS WITHOUT HYPERACTIVITY IMPULSIVITY AND SO FORTH AND ALL THIS JUST REALLY SPEAKS TO THE COMPLEXITY OF EGHTY HT AND YET AND YET WE CAN CONFIDENTLY SAY THAT THERE ARE MORE DRUGS TO TREA EIGHTY EIGHT THAN ANY OTHER PSYCHIATRIC CONDITION WE'VE TALKED ABOUT A FEW OF THOSE NOW BUT AMONG THOSE ATERALL VIVANTS RIDDLIN ALSO CALL MITHELFENIDATE THERE ARE TIME RELEASE VERSIONS THERE ARE DIFFERENT VARIATIONS ON THOSE TIME RELEASE VERSIONS THERE'S EVEN STRAIGHT DEXEDRE N WHICH IS PRESCRIBED FORATY T IN SOME CASES AND ON AND ON AND YOU MIGHT ALSO FIND IT INTERESTING TO KNOW THAT THAT VERY LARGE KIT OF DRUGS ALL OF WHICH LEAST THE ONCE WE TALKD ABOUT SO FAR SYMPATHEMIMATICS ARE STIMULANTS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE AT TREATING EIGHTY HT THEN ARE ANY OTHER COLLECTION OF DRUGS FOR TREATING OTHER PSYCHATRIC DISORDERS SO WHAT ALL OF THAT DIVERSITY OF SYMPTOMOLOGY IN EIGHTY EHT AS WELL AS DIFFERENCES INSENS ATIVITY TO DRUGS IN INDIVIDUAL VARIATION WHAT ALL OF THAT SPEAKS TO IS THAT THE LARGE KIT OF DRUGS THAT'S OUT THERE IS DESIGN TO BE ASSASSED WITH THE CAREFUL CONSULT OF A VERY QUALIFIED PSYCHITRIS IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE CHILD OR ADULT TO ARRIVE AT THE SPECIFIC DRUG AND THE SPECIFIC DOSAGE THAT'S IDEAL FOR THEIR PARTICULAR PATTERN OF TY  T AND THAT ISSUE ACTUALLY GIVES RISE TO THE ANSWER SO THAT NOW SOMEWHAT AGE OLD QUESTION AS TO WHY GIVING STIMULANTS TO A KID THAT IS HYPERACTIVE WOULD CALM THEM DOWN AND THE ANSWER IS THAT THE HYPERACTIVITY IMPULSIVITY AND FOCUS ISSUES PRESENT IN GHTY   IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS ARE THE CONSEQUENCE NOT NECESSARILY OF DEFICIENT ACTIVITY OF NERAL CIRCUITS IN THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX OR DEFICIENT ACTIVITY OF THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK OR DEFICIENT ACTIVITY OF THE SALIENTS NETWORK ET CETERA WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE CASE BASED ON A LOT OF HYGH QUALITY NERA IMAGING DATA IS THAT THE BRAINS OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH EGHTY  T HAVE ALL OF THESE NETWORKS FUNCTIONING BUT THOSE NETWORKS ARE ACTUALLY HYPER CONNECTED THAT IS THEY TEND TO BE COACTIVE AT TIMES WHEN ORDINARILY MEANING IN KIDS AN ADULTS WITHOUT AHDIA SH THEY WOULD NOT BE COACTIVE SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO GET THE IMPRESSION THAT GHT H T IS JUST A DEFICIENCY IN DOPEMIN A NORAPANEFREN AND THAT SIMPLY NOT THE CASE IF YOU RECALL DOPEMING A NORAP IN EFRON ARE NEURO MODULATORS THEY MODULATE THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER NERAL CIRCUITS AND THEY CAN BOTH INCREASE AND DECREASE ACTIVITY WITHIN THOSE CIRCUITS SO YOU DON'T NECSSURLY ONEA THNGABOUT DOPEMING A NORAP AN EFREN JUST AS MOLECULES THAT INCREASE NERAL ACTIVITY AND YOU CERTAINLY DON'T WANT A THING ABOUT EIGHTY EIGHT SHE IS JUST A DEFICIENCY IN DOPEMINE OR DEFICIENCY IN NORAP ANEFREN THE WAY THESE DRUGS WORK WHEN THEY ARE USED EFFECTIVELY TO TREAT EIGHTY  T IS TO TUNE THE AMOUNT OF DOPEMING A NORP AN EFRON THAT ARE PRESENT IN PR ARTICULAR BRAIN NETWORKS IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE PERSON TO ARRIVE AT JUST THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN THE ACTIVATION OF THESE DIFFERENT NURAL CIRCUITS CAUSING THEM LARGELY TO BE LESS SYNCERINEUS IN THEIR FIRING SO THIS TAKES US BACK TO THIS QUESTION A WHY GIVING STIMULANTS TO A KID WOULD CALM THEM DOWN IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT YOUARE GIVING A STIMULANT TO A KID TO PLACE THEM INTO A STATE OF CALM I THINK THAT'S A COMMON MISCONCEPTION RATHER BY INCREASING DOPOMIN IN OR AP INEFRON THESE DRUGS YESS INCREASE LEVELS OF OVER ALL AUTONOMIC AROUSAL THEY ARE AFTER ALL SIMPATHOMEMETICS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TO THE TREATMENT OF AHDT SYMPTOMS YOU ARE ACTIVATING THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS IT TO BE MORE OF A CORDINATOR OF THAT ORCHESTRA CONDUCTOR OR IF YOU PREFER THE ANALOGY TO A TEACHER IN THE CLASSROOM TO RAMP UP THE ACTIVITY OF CERTAIN NARAL CIRCUITS IN A GIVEN MOMENT AND QUIET DOWN THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER NURAL CIRCUITS SUCH THAT THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK AND STILL PERFORMANCE INCREDIBLE ACTIONS AFTER ALL THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK IS INVOLVED NOT JUST IN SELF REFERENCING AND KIND OF DAY DREAMING BUT ALSO CREATIVITY AND IMAGINATION THAT'S BEEN WELL DESCRIBED IN THE LITERATURE AS WELL AS THE SALIENT'S NETWORK IN THESE OTHER NETWORKS THAT ARE DESIGN TO DROP US INTO VERY NARROW TRENCHES OF ATTENTION THESE DRUGS FOR THE TREATMENT OF AHDIT ARE ARE INDEED STIMULANTS BUT THE GOAL OF PRESCRIBING THESE DRUGS TO A CHILD OR ADULT WITH AGHDIST IS TO ADJUST DOSAGE TIMING AND THE DURATION OVER WHICH SOMEBODY TAKES IT IN THEIR LIFE SPAN IN ORDER TO ALLOW THOSE NURAL CIRCUITS TO WORK IN THE PROPER WAY MEANING FOR THE CONDUCTOR TO ACTIVATE THE INSTRUMENTS IN THAT LITTLE SYMPHONY OR BAND IN THE APPROPRIATE ORDER IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT THE RIGHT MUSIC HAS SUPPOSED TO ALL THE INSTRUMENTS PLYING AT ONCE WHICH JUST BE COMPLETE NOISE OR IF GAIN IF YOU PREFER THE CLASS FROM TEACHING ANALOGY FOR THE TEACHER TO CALL ON ONE STUDENT WHILE THE OTHERS ARE QUIET AND THAN TO CALL ON A DIFFERENT STUDENT HAVE ONCE T RETURN TO THEIR SEATS TO HAVE THE STUDENTS WORK IN SMALL GROUPS AGAIN ALL F THIS BY ANALOGY THE POINT BEING THAT DOPEMING AND NORUP ANEFREN ARE ALL ALLOWING THESE NETWORKS TO BE ACTIVATED TO THE PRECISELY CORRECT LEVELS AND IN THE PRECISELY CORRECT SEQUENCE NOW THE OTHER KEY ASPECT OF DRUGS LIKE ADAR ALL FIVE ENTS RIDDLAN AND SIMILAR TO TREAT EHT HT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THESE NEROMODULATORS DOPEMINE AND NORUP ANEFREN BUT IT HAS TO DO WITH THEIR OTHER INCREDIBLE FEATURE BESIDES JUST THEIR ABILITY TO REDUCE NOISE AND INCREASE SIGNAL WITHIN THESE BRAIN NETWORKS AND THAT INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FEATURE IS WHAT WE CALL NEURRO PLASTICITY OR THE BRAIN AND NERVEUS SYSTEMS ABILITY TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE I'VE DONE ENTIRE EPISODES OF T HUBERMEN LAD PODCAST ON NEUR PLASTICITY WHAT IT IS AND HOW TO ACCESS IT AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT AND IN ADULTHOOD BY THE WAY YOU CAN FIND THOSE EPISODES AT HUBERMAN LABDOT CAM BY SIMPLY SEARCHING PLASTICITY IN THE SEARCH FUNCTION BUT THE IMPORTAN THING TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT PLASTICITY IN THE CONTEXTS OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION IS THAT WHILE THERE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO INDUCE NEURO PLASTICITY ALMOST ALL OF THEM ALMOST ALL OF THEM INVOLVE STRONGLY ACTIVATING CERTAIN BRAIN NETWORKS AND IN THAT CASE ALSO STRONG OR ELEVATED RELEASE OF CERTAIN NEUROMODULATORS NOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT DOPEMING AND NORUP ANEFREN THEY ARE BUT TOO OF MANY NERMODULATORS OTHERS INCLUDE CERATONAN SEETO CALLING AND EACH OF THE NEROMODULATORS DOES DIFFERENT THINGS THAT DIFFERENCE IN ABSES IN THE BRAIN AND THERE'E SOME GLOBAL STATEMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE ABOUT EACH OF THEM WE'VE MADE SOME OF THOSE EARLIER LIKE DOPEMINE IBROADLY INVOLVED IN MOTIVATION CRAVING IN PURSUIT AND NOR UP INEFREN IN SIGNAL DETECTION IN DRAWING OT FOCUS OR SALIENTS TO SOMETHING IN OUR ENVIRONMENT OR IN AR A BODY OR INNER EXPERIENCE ZARTONAN DOES OTHER THINGS A SEATO CALLING DOS OTHER THINGS BUT WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND IS THAT ANY TIME THERE IS A DRAMATIC ELEVATION IN DOPAMINE AN NORAPANEFREN RELATIVE TO BASE LINE RELATIVE TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH DOPOMINE AN NORAPANEFRAN JUST PRIOR TO THAT THAT HAS A TENDENCY TO PROMOTE NERO PLASTICITY AT PARTICULAR SYNAPSIS SO HERE IS WHERE IT'S APPROPRIATE TO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT NEURO MODULATORS ARE DIFFERENT THAN NERO TRANSMITTERS NER TRANSMITTERS ARE CHEMICALS THAT JUST LIKE DOPAMIEAN NORAPANEFREN ARE RELEASED BETWEEN NURONS AND THEY ARE WHAT ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE ELECTRICAL SIGNALS GOING UP OR DOWN BETWEEN DIFFERENT NURONS AND AGAIN DOPAMINE A NORAPANEFREN MODULATE THAT ACTIVITY CAUSING A GIVEN AMOUNT OF NERATRANSMITTER TO HAVE AN EVEN GREATER EFFECT FOR INSTANCE SO WHEN WE HEREABOUT DOPOMINE A NORAPANEFRAN AND WE HEARE ABOUT MOIVATION OR FOCUS ET CETERA THAT'S ALL FINE IN GOOD BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT REMEMBER THAT WHEN DOPOMINE AND NORAPANEFREN ARE INCREASED THERE IS A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF STRENGTHENING CONNECTIONS WHERE DOPAOMINE AND NORAPANEFRENARE INCREASED AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT LATER EVEN IF LEVELS OF DOPAMINE A NORAPANEFREN ARE NOT INCREASED IF THEY GO BACK TO BASE LINE IT'S OFTEN THE CASE THAT IF IN OUR PRIOR HISTORY OR THE HISTORY OF A GIVEN SET OF NURONS IN OUR BRAIN THERE WAS MORE DOPAMINE NOR NORAPANEFRAN AROUND IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT THE CONNECTIONS WHERE THAT TOOK PLACE ARE STRENGTHEN AND THEREFORE MORE EASILY ACTIVATED AND THIS TAKES US BACK TO THE REALLY ORIGINAL PURPOSE OF PERSCRIBING THESE SYMPATHEMAMATIC STIMULANTS TO CHILDREN WITH EIGHTY EIGHT SHE DURING DEVELOPMENT IT WAS YES DESIGN TO TRY AND HELP THEM FOCUS TO REDUCE THEIR HYPERACTIVITY AND HELP THEM FOCUS BUT IT WAS ALSO DESINE TO HELP THE BRAIN NETWORKS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR FOCUS TO UNDERGO NERO PLASTICITY THAT IS FOR THE SYNAPSES INVOLVED TO STRENGTHEN SO THAT THOSE NETWORKS COULD FUNCTION MORE EFFICIENTLY LATER ON EVEN AFTER CESSATION OF THE DRUG THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL POINT THAT I THINK IT'S NOT OFTEN DISGUSSED WHEN PEOPLE FOR INSTANC SAY SHOULD I PUT MY KID ON EIGHTY EGH ST METS OR SHOULD I TAKE MY KID OFF OF EIGHTY IGH T MEDS AS THEY TRANSITION FROM ADOLESCENCE TO THEIR LATER TEEN YEARS AND INTO COLLEGE MEAN AFTER ALL NO CHILD OR PARENT OR ADULT FOR THAT MATTER WANTS TO ACHIEVE A BUNCH OF BENEFITS WITH A DRUG AND THEN LOSE THOSE BENEFITS LATER NOR DOES ANY PARENT OR CHILD WANT TO TAKE A DRUG THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO TAKE WHEN THEY COULD ACCESS OTHER ROUTES TO IMPROVING THE NURL CIRCUITRY OR THE FUNCTION OF SOME HEALTH SYSTEM IN THE BODY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK ANYONE REALLY WANTS TO MEDICATE THEIR KIDS UNLESS THEY HAVE TO I WOULD HOPE NOT AND I DON'T THINK ANY KID WANTS TO BE MEDICATED UNLESS THEY ABSOLUTELY NEED TO BE MEDICATED SO INCREASING DOPAME N IN OR UP IN EFFERON WITH THESE DRUGS LIKE ADERALL VIVE ANTS RIDDLIN AND SIMILAR IS CAUSING SEVERAL THINGS AND SOME OF THOSE THINGS ACTUALLY PROVIDE SOME GENERAL ANSWERS AS TO WHETHER NOT PARENTS SHOULD PUT THEIR KIDS ON THESE COMPOUNDS IN THE FIRST PLACE OBVIOUSLY HERE GOING TO DO THAT IN THE UNDER THE CAREFUL CONSULT OF A QUALIFIED PSYCHATERIST I WOULD HOPE AND ONLY UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT ALSO WHETHE R NOT THE CHILD SHOULD STAY ON THOSE DRUGS OVER TIME AND HERE'S WHAT WE DO KNOW FOR SURE I DID A VAST SEARCH WITHIN THE LITERATURE IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT WHAT IS VERY CLEAR WHICH IS THAT CHILDREN WITH EIGHTY EHST TRUE EIGHTY HST WHO ARE DIAGNOSED WITH EIGHTY EIGH T AND ARE TREATED WITH APPROPRIATE DOSES OF DRUGS LIKE ADARALL RIDDLIN OR VIVE ANTS FARE FAR BETTER BOTH IN CHILDHOOD AND LATER IN LIFE WHEN IT COMES TO PERFORMANCE IN SCHOOL PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF FOCUSSING ON ANYTHING AND IN TERMS OF GENERAL OUTCOMES SO FOR INSTANCE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WONDERED AND WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TREATMENT WITH THESE DRUGS EARLY IN LIFE WILL SET UP A PREDISPOSITION FOR ELICIT DRUG ABUSE OR CRAVING IN ADDICTIVE POTENTIAL LATER AND IT IS VERY CLEAR FROM THE STUDIES THAT HAVE EMERGED OVER THE LAST REALLY FIFTEEN YEARS BUT MAINLY WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS S THAT'S WHEN MOST OF THE DAT OFE ARRIVED THAT CHILDREN WITH EIGHTY EIGH T WHO ARE NOT TREATED CORRECTLY BOTH WITH DRUGS AND BEHAVIOURAL TREATMENTS BECAUSE REALLY THE COMBINATION OF DRUGS AND BEHAVORAL TREATMENTS IS THE OPTIMAL SITUATION SO KIDS WITH EIGHTY H T WHO ARE NOT TREATED WITH DRUGS AND BEHAVORAL TREATMENTS TO DEAL WITH THEIR EIGHTY IH ST HAVE A MUCH HIGHER TENDENCY TOWARDS ELICIT DRUG USE AND ADDICTIVE DRUG POTENTIAL IN THEIR ADULTHOOD OCESO THERE IS A REAL DANGER TO NOT TREATING EIGHTY H T DURING CHILDHOOD AND THE REVERSE IS ALSO TRUE WHICH IS THAT CHILDREN WITH EIGHTY EIH ST WHO TAKE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT AR SYMPATHEMEMETICS SO YES AS YOU'VE HEARD THEY ARE SPEED AMPHEDEMINAS SPEED ALTHOUGH I SHOULD SAY IF THEY TAKE METHEL PHENIDATE RIDDLAN OR CONCERATO OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT THAT'S NOT AMPHEDEMIE NONE THE LESS IT'S A STIMULANT IS A SYMPATHEMEMATIC ALSO THESER KIDS THAT ARE TAKING THESE DRUGS TURY DEVELOPMENT AND THEREFORE LEVELS AF DOPOMINE LEVELS OF NORUPE AND EFFRENT ARE BEING INCREASED IN THEIR BRAIN AND BODY AND YOU MIGHT SAY WELL WOULDN'T THAT LEAD TO A CRAVING FOR THESE THINGS LATER IN LIFE AND THAT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE THE CASE IN FACT THERE'RE SOME VERY NICE NOR IMAGING STUDIES MAINLY POSITRONOMISSION TOMOGRAPHY STUDIES THAT ALL PROVIDE A LINK TO IN THE SHOWNO CAPTIONS THAT SHOW THAT EARLY TREATMENT WITH THESE DRUGS ACTUALLY LEADS TO COMMINATIONS OF INCREASED DOPOMINE TRANSMISSION IN THE FORBAIN LATER IN LIFE AT A LOWER LEVEL AR A LOWER THRESHOLD I SHOULD SAY IN A WAY THAT ESSENTIALLY SAYS THERE'S NORMALIZATION OF THE CIRCUITS ACROSS TIME BY THE APPLICATION OF THESE DRUGS EARLY IN LIFE AGAIN IN THE CASE OF CHILDREN THAT HAVE DIAGNOSED EIGHT EIGHT I IN NO WAY SHE PERFORM WANT TO IMPLY THOT ALL CHILDREN SHOULD BE TREATED WITH THESE DRUGS IS QUITE CLEARLY NOT GOING TO BE A GOOD IDEA SO ALL OF THIS REALLY SPEAKS TO THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF GETTING AN ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS OF EIGHTY EIGHT YO DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA INCLUDE MANY THINGS IN CHILDREN THEIRE MULTIPUL THEIR MORE THAN NINE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR EACH OF THE CATEGORIES RELATING TO IMPULSIVITY HYPERACTIVITY AND SO ON SO A WELL QUALIFIED PSYCHITRIS WILL DO SEVERAL THINGS THEY WILL FIRST OF ALL DO A CAREFUL DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION OF A CHILD AND IN ADDITION ONE WOULD HOPE THAT THEY WOULD THINK ABOUT PRESCRIBING BOTH APPROPRIATE PHORMOCALOGIC TREATMENTS RADIAIGHTSTY BUT ALSO BE AWARE OF AND PRESCRIBE THE VARIOUS OTHER TYPES OF PRESCRIPTIONS MEANING BEHAVIORAL PRESCRIPTIONS SO THAT ARE CLEARLY CERTAIN LEARNING TOOLS AND THINGS THAT KIDS CAN DO IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THEIR ABILITY TO FOCUS AND TO BE LESS IMPULSIVE THAT COMBINE ESPECIALLY WELL WITH DRUG TREATMENTS AS WELL AS NEW ADVANCEMENTS IN THE REALM OF NEUTRICIAN AND SUPPLEMENTATION THAT ARE CONSTANTLY COMING ON LINE AND THE BEST PSYCHATRIS ARE GOING TO BE TURNED INTO ALL OF THOSE ASPECTS OF TREATMENT FOR AIGHTY GH T NOT JUST PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BUT ALSO BEHAVORAL TREATMENTS ALSO NEUTRITIONAL GUIDELINES ALSO SUPPLEMENTATION AND ALSO UPDATING EACH IN ALL OF THOSE THINGS AS A CHILD MATURES FROM EACH STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT TO THE NEXT NOW THE OTHER COMMON QUESTION IS IF A CHILD HAS BEEN TREATED WITH THESE EIGHTY EIGH TEA MEDS STURING DEVELOPMENT DO THEY NEED TO CONTINUE ON THOSE DRUGS INDEFINITELY AND THE SHORT ANSWER TO THIS IS IT DEPENDS AND THAT CAN BE A SOMEWHAT FRUSTRATING ANSWER I REALIZE BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE ASSESSED IN A FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY LET'S RECALL THAT THE USE OF THESE DRUGS TO TREAT EIGHTY EIGHTY IS DESIGN TO ACCOMPLISH TWO THINGS ITS DESIGN TO IMPROVE THE FUNCTION OF THOSE NERAL CIRCUITS THAT ALLOW A CHILD TO FOCUS AND IT'S ALSO DESIGN TO INCREASE THE STRENGTH OF THOSE CIRCUITS TO EFFECTIVELY TEACH THE CIRCUITS HOW TO LEARN WHAT FOCUS IS IN OTHER WORDS THESE DRUGS ARE DESIGNED IN SOME CASES TO BE USED AND THEN WITHDRAWN LATER BECAUSE THE CIRCUITS THAT THEY HELPED BUILD UP ARE FUNCTIONING WELL IN SOME CASES HOWEVER THE CIRCUITS THAT UNDER LIE FOCUS ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO FUNCTION AT THE LEVEL REQUIRED FOR NORMAL HEALTHY LIFE PROGRESSION UNLESS THERE'S CONTINUED APPLICATION OF THE DRUG SO HOW WOULD THIS WORK IN THE REAL WORLD CONTECT WELL THINK ANY CHILD OR ADOLESCENT OR PERSON YOUNGER THAN TWENTY FIVE THAT'S TAKEN THESE DRUGS HAS NO DOUBT ACHIEVED SOME LEVEL OF NAUROL PLASTICITY OF THE NARL CIRCUITS RELATED TO ALL THE THINGS WE CALL FOCUS IAND I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THEREIS NO SINGLE BRAIN AREA OR SET OF BRAIN CIRCUITS FOR WHAT IM REFERRING TO IS FOCUS BECAUSE AFTER ALL FOCUSS VOLVES TASK SWITCHING FOCUS INVOLVES ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT COGNIVE OPERATIONS DEPENDING ON WHAT WERE FOCUSING ON THE FOCSING ON A SPORT IS ABASICALLY A PRACTICE OF DIRECTING ONE'S ATTENTION INDIFFERENT LOCATIONS AT DIFFERENT MOMENTS FOCUSING ON STUDYING IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PATTERN OF FOCUS ALL TOGETHER BUT THE POINT BEING IF A PERSON TWENTY FIVE YEARS OR YOUNGER TAKES A DRUG THAT INCREASES DOPOMING THE NOREP ANEFRAN AND ASSUMING THAT THINGS ARE WORKING MEANING THE DOSE IS RIGHT THEIR ACHIEVING BETTER ABILITY TO FOCUS ET CETERA THOSE CIRCUITS ARE GOING TO GET STRONGER AND IT SEEMS ENTIRELY REASONABLE IN FACT IT WAS SUPPORTED BY THE PSYCHIATRIST THAT I SPOKE TO PRIOR TO THIS EPISODE THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ON EIGHTY EIGHTY MEDS FOR ANY POINT OF TIME PRIOR TO TWENTY FIVE TALK TO THEIR PSYCHIATRIST ABOUT WHAT TAPERING OFF THOSE DRUGS IN ORDER TO EXAMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY STILL NEED THOSE DRUGS WOULD LOOK LIKE NOW I MENTION THE WERE TAPER BECAUSE THERE IS WITH DRALL POTENTIAL OF SIMPLY STOPPING THESE DRUGS VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE THEY DO RAMP UP DOPEMING AND NORIPANEFRON EVEN THOUGH THEY INCREASE PLASTICITY OF THE NORL CIRCUITS FOR FOCUS AND MOOD AND MOTIVATION IF ONE VERY ABRUPTLY CEASES TAKING ANY OF THESE DRUGS IT DOES NOT FEEL GOOD THAT DROP AND DOPOMINE THAT ONE INEVITABLY EXPERIENCES IS ALMOST ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH LETHARGY WITH DEPRESSED MOOD WITH FEELING NOT GOOD IN A NUMBER WAYS AND OF COURSE CHALLENGES IN FOCUS SO ANY TIME ONE IS GOING TO GO OFF ONE OF THESE DRUGS OR SAMPLE WHAT IT IS TO EVEN REDUCE DOSAGE THAT HAS TO BE DONE IN CLOSE COMMUNICATION WITH A BORD CERTIFIED PSYCHIATRIST AT THE SAME TIME IT WAS MADE VERY CLEAR TO ME FROM T H T EXPERT PSYCHITRIS THAT REDUCTIONS IN DOSAGE OVER TIME OFTEN ARE OPTIMAL FOR A PATIENT EAND THIS GETS TO THE WHOLE ISSUE OF DOSAGE GENERALLY I SPEND A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME TALKING TO SOMEBODY WHO PROSCRIBES THESE DRUGS BOTH TO CHILDREN AND ADULTS ABOUT DOSAGE RANGES AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HOW MUCH ONE SHOULD TAKE IN FACT IN WAN'T ANY ONE TO THINK THAT WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY SHOULD DICTATE WHAT THEY SHOULD TAKE SPECIFICALLY BCAUSE THAT SOMETHING THAT REALLY HAS TO BE WORKED OUT ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS BUT IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT YOU LOOK AT THE STUDIES ON ATARALL AND METHELFHENEDATE BUTYOU'LL SEE IT IS A PRETTY BROAD RANGE IN THOSE STUDIES AND THAT'S BECAUSE SOME OF THE STUDIES YOU USED PEOPLE THAT WERE ALREADY TAKING THESE DRUGS AND ASK THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN NER IMAGING STUDIES OTHER STUDIES ACTUALLY PUT PEOPLE ON THESE DRUGS FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME OR ADJUSTED THEIR DOSAGE AND SO YOU'LL SEE A A TREMENDOUS RANGE OF DRUG DOSES EXPLORED FOR INSTANCE YOU WILL SEE ANYWHERE FROM TEN TO FORTY MELIGRAMS OF ATARALL PER DAY YOU'LL SEE ANYWHERE FROM TEN TO SIXTY MELIGRAMS OF RIDDLIN PER DAY AND HERE WE COULD EASILY BE TALKING BOUT STUD IES ON CHILDREN OR ADULTS WITH RESPECT TO VIVANTS YOU'LL SEE THAT THE DOSAGES TEND TO BE MUCH HIGHER IN PART THAT'S BECAUSE VIVE ANTS HAS IF YOU RECALL IT'S THAT LICENE WHICH IS A BIG MOLECULES STUCK ON D M PHEDEMINE WHICH IS A SMALLER MOLECULE AND SO THE DOSAGES OF VIVE ANTS TEND TO BE IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILIGRAM RANGES BUT MOST OF THAT HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF VIVE ANTS IS NOT GOING TO BE THE D AMPHEDAMIN ITS GOING TO BE THE LICEN WHICH DOESN'T DO ANYTHING IN THE CONTEXT OF TREATING THE BRAIN IS JUST THEIR TO CONTROL THE SLOW RELEASE SO IT'S THOUGHT THAT A HUNDRED MELIGRAMS OF VIVANTS TRANSLATES TO ROUGHLY NINE MILIGRAMS OF ATARALL AND ON AND ON AND ACTIL IT'S PRETTY HARD TO TRANSLATE BETWEEN DOSAGES OF DIFFERENT DRUGS IN ANY DIRECT WAY AND IN SPEAKING WITH A PSYCHIATRIST EXPERT IN EIGHTY EHT IN PREPARATION FOR THA EPISODE HE MADE VERY CLEAR THAT IT IS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT HOW A CHILD OR ADULT WILL REACT TO A GIVEN DOSAGE OF ANY OF THESE STRUGS SO MUCH SO IN FACT THAT HE AN IDOTALLY REPORT TO ME THAT ONE OF HIS PATIENTS IS A MAL THREE HUNDRED POUNDS DIGNOSE WITH EIGHTY T AND WHO ACHIEVES TREMENDOUS RELIEF FROM JUST TWO POINT FIVE MILIGRAMS OF ATARALL PER DAY AND AT THE SAME TIME HE HAS TWO PATIENTS BOTH OF WHOM ARE SISTER SO THEYR GENETICALLY RELATED WHO ARE IN THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TO HUNDRED AND FORTY POUND RANGE WHO DID NOT RESPOND WELL AT ALL FOR THE TREATMENT OF THEIR EGHTY T UNTIL THEIR DOSAGES WERE VERY VERY HIGH AND IF I TELL YOU THESE DOSAGES I JUST WANT TO WARN YOU IN ADVANCE I AM NOT SUGGESTING ANY ONE EXPLORE THESE DOSAGES WITHOUT OF COURSE THE APPROVAL OF THEIR PSYCHITRIST TURNS OUT THAT NEITHER OF THESE TWO YOUNG WOMEN RESPONDED AT ALL TO EIGHTY  SH MENICATION UNTIL THEY ACHIEVE DOSAGES IN THE RANGE OF A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY IN THE CASE OF ONE SISTER AND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILIGRAMS IN THE CASE OF THE OTHER SISTER PER DAY WHICH IS AN ASTRONOMICALLY HIDOSES ON THE FACE OF IT BUT THIS PHYSICIAN AGAIN BOARD CERTIFIED PHYSICIAN EXPE RT IN EIGHTIATY VERIFIED FOR ME THAT INDEED NEITHER OF THEM EXPERIENCE ANY DISCOMFORT OR SIE EFFECTS THAT LET THEM DO NOT WANT TO TAKE THE DRUG BUT OF COURSE THAT AMOUNT OF ADERALL COULD SEND SOMEBODY ELSE INTO AN ABSOLUTE PSYCHOTIC FIT COULD PROTENTIALLY EVEN CAUSE CARDIACCHORESSED I MEAN ITS REMARKABLE THE RANGES OF ADER ALL THAT ARE USED EFFECTIVELY IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS ND THIS IS TRUE FOR A LOT OF THE OTHER SYMPATHEMEMETICS USED TO TREAT EIGHTY HHTO AND OF COURSE THE GOOD SYCHATRIS WILL ALWAYS ASSESS DOSAGE AS IT RELATES TO POSITIVE BENEFITS IN A RELIEF OF SYMPTOMS SO RELIEF OF IMPULSIVITY RELIEF OF HEIPERACTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS IN ABILITY TO FOCUS AND OF COURSE THEY THEY ARE GOING TO CONSIDER SIDE EFFECTS ANY UNCOMFORTABLE ADVERSE EFFECTS THAT COME FROM TAKING THE DRUG AT A GIVEN DOSAGE OR TAKEN THE DRUG AT ALL NOW OF COURSE THE ALL BEGS THE QUESTION A WHY SUCH TREMENDOUS VARIATION IS THIS DUE TO GENETIC DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNT OF DOBOMEN OR NOR P ANEFFERON THAT PEOPLE MAKE IT APPEARS THAT THE MAJOR UNDERLYING FACTOR FOR WHY PEOPLE REQUIRE SUCH VASTLY DIFFERENT DOSAGES OF THESE SYMPATHEMEMETICS FOR THE RELIEF OF EGHTIHTY HAS TO DO WITH THE DIFERENT ENZIMES OR LEVELS OF ANZIMES THAT PEOPLE MAKE WHICH MATABOLIZE THESE DRUGS BOTH IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS NO SIMPLE BLOOD TEST OR SALIVEATTEST OR TEST OF ANY KIND THAT CAN PREDICT HOW SOMEONE WILL RESPOND TO THESE DRUGS SO THE MOST LOGICAL AND SAFE WAY TO ASSESS DOSAGE IS TO START WITH THE LOWEST POSSIBLE EFFECTIVE DOSE AND TO INCREASE ONLY AS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE POSITIVE BENEFITS WHILE OF COURSE PAYING ATTENTION TO ANY SIDE EFFECTS THAT MIGHT ARISE A QUESTION THAT COMES UP FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN DISCUSSING THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF DRUGS LIKE ADERAL RIDDLIN AND VIVE ANTS IS WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT HEIGHT OR GROWTH OR DEVELOPMENT IN SOME OTHER WAY THIS IS A LOGICAL QUESTION TO ASK BECAUSE AFTER ALL THESE DRUGS ARE EFFECTIVELY MIMICKING STRESS IN THE BODY AND MOST EVERYONE IS HEARD BY NOW THAT WHILE STRESS CAN HELP US IN TE SHORT TERM IT HELPS US DEPLOY A MUNE MOLECULES TO PROTECT US AGAINST INFECTION IT SHARPENS ORE VISUAL FOCUS IN OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO THINGS FOR SURVIVAL CHRONICALLY ELEVATING OUR STRESS OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME WE KNOW REDUCES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ARMUN SYSTEM AND CAN ACTUALLY CAUSE CERTAIN FORMS OF BRAIN DYGENERATION AND WHILE THERE AREN'T A LOT OF LONGITUDINAL STUDIES ON THE HEIGHTS OF KIDS WITH EIGHTY HT AND OF COURSE WE NEVER CAN TELL HOW TALL SOMEONE WOULD HAVE GROWN TO BE IF THEY WERE TREATED WITH A DRUG BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A PERFECT CONTROL EXPERIMENT EVEN IN THE CASE OF IDENTICAL TWIN EXPERIMENTS AND THEREIN THERE AREN'T THAT MANY OF THOSE EXAMPLES WHERE ONE TWIN WAS TREATED RADY H T IN THE OTHER WASN'T ET CETERA BUT HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT TREATMENT WITH SYMPATHEMAMETIC STURING DEVELOPMENT PROVIDED THE DOSAGES ARE KEPT IN THE APPROPRIATE RANGES IS GOING TO LIMIT OVER ALL HEIGHT IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA IT APPEARS THAT CHILDREN WITH EIGHTY EIH T WHO ARE TREATED WITH EIGHTY H T MEDS ACTUALLY ARRIVE AT SLIGHTLY HIGHER BEAM IS BODY MASS INDEXES COMPARED TO GE MATCHED PEERS NOW OF COURSE BODY MAX INDEX DOESN'T NECESSARILY CORRELATE WITH HEIGHT RIGHT SOME ONE COULD NOT ACHIEVE A FULL HEIGHT BUT COULD BE HEAVIER EITHER THROUGH BONE OR FAT OR MUSCLE OR COMMINATION OF ALL THREE BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THE APPROPRIATE USE OF EHT IH  MEDS DURING DEVELOPMENT IS NOT STUNTING DEVELOPMENT IN ANY KIND OF OVER ALL WAY IT'S NOT PREVENTING MATTURATION OF THE BODY IN WAYS THAT ARE LEADING TO REDUCED WEIGHT OR SOMEHOW IMPAIRED GROWTH OVER ALL WITH THAT SAID LONG TERM ELEVATIONS OF SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ACTIVITY DOES CARRY SOME RISK AND ONE OF THE PRIMARY RISKS THAT PEOPLE OF WONDERED ABOUT IS PARTY OF ASCULAR RISK THIS MAKES PERFECT SENTESE RIGHT WHEN YOU INCREASE THE ACTIVITY THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM YOU CREASE BLOOD PRESSURE YOU IN CREASE HEART RATE YOU INCREASE IN SOME CASES PERFERA SWEATING I ALL THE THINGS THAT WE ASSOCIATE WITH STRESS IS YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT A CHILD OR ADULT WITH EGHT H THAT TAKES THESE SYMPATHEMAMETICS EVERY DAY EVEN IF THE DOSAGE IS KEPT IN ARRANGE THAT DOESN'T ALLOW THEM TO EXPERIENCE ANY IMMEDIATE UNTOWARD SIDE EFFECTS SO THEY'RE NOT FEELING MISERABLE THEY'RE JUST FILLING LIKE THEY CAN FOCAS BETTER BUT ONE ALWAYS WONDERS WHAT'S GOING ON UNDER THE HOOD SO TO SPEAK THERE IS AS FAR AS I KNOW ONE MAJOR STUDY THAT'S ADDRESS THIS AND THE CONCLUSIONS OF THAT STUDY WERE A LITTLE BIT HARD TO PUT INTO A SINGLE CATEGORY IT DID POINT TO A SUBTLE INCREASE IN CARTY OF ASCULAR RISK BUT THE RESULTS DID NOT POINT TO ANYTHING SO DRAMATIC THAT THE AUTHORS OF THE STUDY WARNED AGAINST TAKING THESE DRUGS OR ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO CEASE TAKING THESE DRUGS AGAIN PROVIDED THEIRE BEING PRESCRIBED BY ABORD CERTIFINED PHYSICIAN FOR EIGHTY EIGH T END AT THE APPROPRIATE DOSAGE FOR THAT PERSON THAT SAID I THINK THIS ALL AGAIN SPEAKS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF ARRIVING AT MINIMAL EFFECTIVE DOSAGE AND IT STANDS TO REASON THAT IF YOUR SOMEBODY WHOSE TAKING EHTY EIGH T MEDS OR IF YOUR CHILD IS TAKING EIGHTY IGHT T MEDS THAT ONE WOULD WANT TO DO ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT THEY COULD DO IN ORDER TO TRY AN IMPROVE CARTY OF ASCULAR HEALTH OR AT LEAST NOT PUT IT AT ADDITIONAL RISKS SO THOSE ARE GOING TO BE THE OBVIOUS THINGS LIKE IAVOIDING SMOKING OR VAPING NICOTINE I'M REGULAR EXERCISE IS GOING TO BE ENCOURAGE AND THINGS OF THAT SORT AND THAT DOVE TAILS INTO A BUNCH OF OTHER QUESTIONS THAT ARE OFTEN ASKED ANY TIME THE TOPIC OF ATARAL RIDDLIN COMES UP WHICH IS WHAT ABOUT ALCOHOL YOU KNOW IS DRINKING ALCHOL AT THE SAME TIME OR AT DIFFERENT TIMES EVEN GOING TO BE PROBLEMATIC IF ONE IS TAKING THESE DRUGS IS TAKING BENS THA DIAZAPINES GOING TO BE A PROBLEM ET CETERA ET CETERA THERE'S A VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD ANSWER TO THIS WHICH IS IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT ALCOHL CERTAINLY IN CHILDREN BUT ALSO AN ADULTS IS BEST NOT CONSUMED I DID ENTIRE EPISODE ABOUT ALCOHOL ICH GOT INTO THIS AND THE DATA FOR THIS IF YOU'VE HEARD THAT HAVING SOME ALCALL IN PARTICULAR RED WINE IS BETTER FOR YOU THAN NO ALCALL THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE SORRY IT'S NOT TRUE MOST ADULTS WHO ARE NOT ALCOHOLICS CAN PROBABLY HAVE UP TO TWO THAT'S RITE TWO DRINKS PER WEEK AND STILL I BE ON THE SAFE SIDE OF HEALTH ALTHOUGH ZERO IS BETTER THAN TWO AND ONCE YOU GET PAST TWO THESE START SEEING EFFECTS ON VERYOUS SYSTEMS INCLUDING IN CREASE CANCER RISK ESPECIALLY BRAIN NOR ON LOSS AND DEGENERATION RISK I COVERED ALL OF THOSE DATA AN THE EPISODE AND ALCLL THAT YOU CAN FINED IT HUBERMEN LAPDOT CALME COMBINING ALCOHOL WITH SYMPATHEMEMETICS EVEN THOUGH THEY RESIDE IN VERY DIFFERENT PATHWAYS WITHIN THE BRAIN IN FACT THE SYMPATHEMEMETICS ARE DRIVING UP SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ACTIVITY ORAS ALCHOLL IS ACTUALLY DOING THE OPPOSITE SDEPRESSING IT AND YET ALL THE DATA POINT TO THE FACT THAT COMBINING ALCOHOL WITH SYMPATHEMEMETICS SUCH AS FIVE ANTS ATERAL RIDDLE IN IT OR ANY KIND OF EMPHEDEMINE IS GOING TO BE MORE DETRIMENTAL TO THE BRAIN AND BODY THAN SIMPLY TAKING THOSE DRUGS ON THEIR OWN PUT DIFFERENTLY AND MORE DIRECTLY IF YOU ARE TAKING ANY OF THE DRUGS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TO TREAT EIGHTY HT OR IF YOU JUST HAPPEN TO BE TAKING THEM FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO AVOID DRINKING ALCHOL AT ANY TIME AND YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO AVOID BENZO DIAZAPINES AND SIMILAR UNLESS THEY'VE BEEN PRESCRIBED TO YOU BY YOUR PHYSICIAN IN ADVANCE OF THIS EPISODE I PUT A CALL OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR QUESTIONS ABOUT ATERALL ET CETERA AND I GOT A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEIR IMPACTS OF THESE DRUGS ON THE HORMONE SYSTEMS OF THE BODY AND IF THEY IMPACT THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM IN PARTICULAR I'LCO GOT QUESTIONS ABOUT WHEATHER NOT THESE DRUGS IMPACT SECUAL BEHAVIOR OR LABEDO OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT IN REVIEWING THE LITE RTURE WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT THERE ARE VERY FEW STUDIES UNFORTUNATELY OF THE LONG TERMEFFECTS OF THESE DRUGS ON THE ENDERGRAN OR HORMONE SYSTEMS OF THE BODY BUT WE DO KNOW A FEW THINGS FOR SHORE FIRST OF ALL WHEN YOU INCREASE THE ACTIVITY OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME YOU ARE VERY LIKELY INCREASING LEVELS OF CORTIS ALL CORTISOLISA COTING STRESS HORMONE BUT CORTISALL ALSO PLAYS SOME REALLY IMPORTANT POSITIVE ROLLS IN YOUR BODY IN FACT YOU WANT CORTESALL RELEASED SPECIALLY EARLY IN THE DAY YOU DON'T WANT CORTISLL RELEASE SO MUCH LATE IN THE DAY THIS ACTUALLY RELATES BACK TO TIMING AND SCHEDULES OF TAKING DRUGS AS TO SOMETHING AGAIN THAT NEEDS TO BE WORKED OUT WITH YOUR PSYCHIATRIST WERE YOUR CHILD'S PSYCHIATRIST BUT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT DRUGS FOR THE TREATMENT OF EIGHTY HTY IS THAT EACH AND ALL OF THEM HAS A DIFFERENT TIME COURSE OF ACTION SO RIDDLAND IS VERY SHORT LIVED WHICH MIGHT SOUND BAD BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT MULTIBLE TIMES THROUGHOUT THE DAY BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SLEEP IN THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING LOW CORTES ALL AT NIGHT AND THESE DRUGS INCREASE CORTIES ALL AND TH IMPORTNCE OF GETTING SLEEP BECAUSE AFTER ALL SLEEP IS THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE IN KIDS AND ADULTS ITS RESPONSIBLE FOR GROWTH ITS WHEN NARROW PLASTICITY HAPPENS IS JUST SO VITALLY IMPORTANT A LOT OF THE DRUGS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT CAN SEVERELY LIMIT ONE'S ABILITY TO FALL AND STAY ASLEEP AND SO A SHORT ACTING DRUG LIKE RIDDLIN IS ACTUALLY ATTRACTIVE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF BEING ABLE TO TAKE IT IN THE MORNING AND STILL GET ASLEEP AT NIGHT OR TAKING IT IN THE MORNING AND IN THE AFTERNOON AND MAY BE EVEN AGAIN IN THE EVENING DEPENDING ON THE PERSON AND THEN STILL BEING ABLE TO FALL ASLEEP AT NIGHT WHEREAS LONG DURATION RELEASE OF D MPHEDAMINE WHICH IS WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU TAKE VIVE ANTS FOR SOME PEOPLE IS GOING TO INHIBIT THEIR SLEEP THEY'LL GET A NICE STEADY RISE AND IMPROVEMENT IN FOCUS AND REDUCTION IN HYPER ACTIVITY BUT THEY MIGHT HAVE A LOT OF TROUBLE FALLING ASLEEP AT NIGHT AND ATARALL HAVING A SOMEWHAT INTERMEDIATE TIME COURSE OF ACTION BETWEEN RIDDLEAND WHICH IS SHORT LIVED AND VIVE ANTS WHICH IS VERY LONG LIVED PERHAPS IS GOING TO BE THE BEST SOLUTION FOR SOMEBODY ELSE WHERE THEY CAN TAKE IT EARLY IN THE DAY PERHAPS A LOW DOSE MAY BE AGAIN LATER IN THE DAY LOW DOSE AND THEN STILL FALL ASLEEP AT NIGHT BUT I'VE SPOKEN TO PEOPLE AND SPOKE TO THIS CLINATION EXPERT AND A D  G WHO TOLD ME THAT SOME PEOPLE TO TAKE AS LITTLE AS TWO POINT FIVE MELIGRAMS OF ADERAL AT SIX A M AND HAVE A HARD TIME FALLING ASLEEP LATER THAT NIGHT AT ELEVEN P MASO AGAIN VASTLY DIFFERENT SENSITIVITIES TO THESE DRUGS LEADING TO VASTLY DIFFERNT REQUIREMENTS OF DOSAGE AND TIMING OF IN TAKE AND WHICH PARTICULAR DRUG SOMEBODY MIGHT CHOOSE TO OR CHOOSE NOT TO TAKE SO HOW DOES THAT RELATE TO HORMONES AND SEC AND REPRODUCTION WELL CORTISALL ITSELF IS A HORMONE IT CAN ACT AS A BIT OF A HORMONE AND A NERRO TRANSMITTER IN THE BRAIN BUT FOR THE MOST PART IT'S ACTING AS A HORMONE IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND IT DOES A NUMBER OF THINGS FIRST OF ALL IT CAN ENHANCE YOUR LEVELS OF FOCUS AN ALERTNESS IT CAN ACTIVATES YOURMAN SYSTEM I KNOW THE IMINOLOGIS OUT THEIR JUST CRINGE WHEN I SAY ACTIVATE THE MUAN SYSTEM URMIAN SYSTEM IS ALWAYS DOING VARIOUS THINGS I'M SO IT'S ALWAYS ACTIVE JUST AS YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS ALWAYS ACTIVE BUT IT CAN TO BE SPECIFIC IT CAN AMPLEFY OR MOBILIZE THE RELEASE OF ANTIAN FLAMMATORY MOLECULES IN YOUR BRAIN EMBODY TO COMBAT DIFFERENT TYPES OF BACTERIAL VIRAL AND FUNGL INFECTIONS SDOING AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF POSITIVE THINGS IT'S ALSO INVOLVED IN SETTING MOOD HAS INTERACTIONS WITH FIROID HORMONE PATHWAYS I'VE DONE ENTIRE EPISODES ABOUT CORTISAL AND CORTISAL REGULATION TO PAINT ALL OF THAT WITH A VERY BROADBRUSH AND BRIEFLY NOW IT'S ADVANTAGEOUS TO HAVE YOUR CORTISALL RELEASE HIGH IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY AND TO TAPER OFF TOWARD THE END OF THE DAY IN FACT LATE DAY ELEVATIONS AND CORTISALL ARE A STRONG CORLET OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTEMS THIS WAS DEMONSTRATED BY MY COLLEAGUES DAVID SPEAGLE AND ROBERT SUPOLSKAT STAMFORD CHOOL OF MEDICINE BUT THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT CORTISAL IS BAD IT'S TO SAY THAT THE TIMING OF CORTISALL RELEASE IS HE SO DO THESE SYMPATHEMEMETIC DRUGS DISRRUPT THE ENDICRAN SYSTEM WELL THEY CAN IF YOU ARE VERY AWAKE AND VERY ALERT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT YOUR TAKING YOUR SYMPATHEMOMETIC TREATMENT FOR ADY T EARLY IN THE DAY OR LATE IN THE DAY YOU ARE VERY LIKELY EXPERIENCING ELEVATIONS IN CORTIESALL LATE IN THE DAY SO IT IS IMPORTANT EVEN FOR THOSE VYIEU THAT LIKE TO STUDY AND NEEDS TO FOCUS IN THE EVENING AN NIGHT TIME HOURS THAT YOU TRY AND LIMIT YOUR LEVELS OF OVER ALL ALERTNESS AND CERTAINLY STRESS LATE IN THE DAY BECAUSE DOING THAT DAY AFTER DY AFTER DAY FOR SEVERAL WEEKS OR MONTHS OR YEARS CAN INDY DISRUPT OTHER HORMONES IN THE ENDICRAN SYSTEM AND AGAIN THAT'S BECAUSE CORTISALIS INTERACTION WITH TIEROID HORMONE AND TESTASTRONE AND ESTROGEN IN FACT CORTESALL IN MANY WAYS COMPETES WITH OR CAN OUTCOMPETE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF TESTASTRONE AND OTHER SO CALLED STEROID HORMONES REMEMBER CORTESALL ITSELF IS A CORTIC STEEROID HORMONE SO WHEN WE HEAR THE  STEROIDS OFTENIZES PEOPLE JUSTING ABY ATHLEDES AND STEROID TOBUSE IN SPORTS BUT STERAD HORMONES INCLUDES A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF HORMONES WHICH ARE GOOD FOR US ARE INDODGING A STRAD HARMONES ARE VITAL FOR ALL SORTS OF THINGS VITALITY REPRODUCTION ET CETERA AND THE WAY THIS WORKS IN GENERAL TERMS IS THAT THE COLLESTERAL MOLECULE IS USED TO CREATE TESTASTRONE AND CORTESALL AND ESTEROGEN IF WE MAKE TOO MUCH CORTESALL WE IN MANY WAYS ARE REDUCING THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TESTASTRONE THAT WE MAKE OR THAT IS ACTIVE ET'S NOT EXACTLY THAT STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT WE CAN MAKE THAT STATEMENT WITH WITH CONFIDENCE FOR INSTANCE IF YOU SPIKE YOUR CORTESALL JUST BRIEFLY DURING THE DACASY OF SOME SORT OF STRESSFUL EVENT THAT'S NOT GOING TO INHIBIT YOUR TESTASTRO IN FACT IT PROBABLY IS GOING TO BOOSTYOUR TESTASTRONE LEVELS SOMEWHAT HOWEVER IF YOUR CORTISALL LEVELS OR CHRONICALLY ELEVATED YES INDEED IT'S LIKELY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SUPPRESS YOUR TOTAL AND OR FREE UNBOUND FORMS OF TESTASTRONE AND DOWNSTREAM TO THAT YOU WILL EXPERI ITS EFFECTS SUCH AS REDUCTIONS AN LEBIDO REDUCTIONS IN A MUSCLE AND BONE MASS REDUCTIONS IN ALL SORTS OF ASPECTS OF TESTOSTRONE RELATED PSYCHOLOGY AND BODILY BIOLOGY THIS IS TRUE FOR BOTH MALES AND FEMALES AND THE SAME THING COULD BE SAID FOR ESTEROGEN NOW WHAT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO SAY IS WHETHER NOT TAKING A GIVEN TREATMEN FOR AHDY H T IS GOING TO FOR INSTANCE PREVENT A WOMAN FROM OPULATING THAT COULD HAPPEN THROUGH CRONIC ELEVATIONS AND CARTISAL BUT THERE'S NO DIRECT LENGKTH MEANING THERE'RE NO STUDIES AT LEAST THAT I'M AWARE OF SHOWING THAT PEOPLE THAT TAKE ADERALL HAVE IRREGULAR ODULATORY PSYCLES OR THAT THEY CEASE MENSTRATING ENTIRELY I DON'T HINK THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE FOR THAT WHATSOEVER NOR IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE THAT TAKE ATERAL OR OTHER SYMPATHEMEMETICS FOR THE TREATMENT OF EIGHTY H  HAVE LOWER OVER ALL TESTOSTRO IN FACT YOU CAN IMAGINE ALL SORTS OF INSTANCES IN WHICH THE OPPOSITE WAS TRUE THAT A CHILD OR YOUNG ADULT OR ADULT WHO HAS EIGHTY H T BUT THEN GOES ON THESE MEDS TO IMPROVE THEIR SYMPTEMS IS NOW FOCUSING AND ACHIEVING MOREN LIFE WE KNOW THAT HAPPINESS CAN IMPACT DOPAMINE AND VICE VERSA AND TESTOSTRONE LEVELS AND PRODUCTIVITY ITSELF AND REACHING OUR GOALS CAN FEED BACK ON THE HORMONE SYSTEM SO ANY TIME THERE'S A DISCUSSION ABOUT HORMONES OR A STUDY THAT SHOWS THAT DOING ACTS OR NOT DOING WY IMPACTS HORMON LEVELS OF A GIVEN TYPE WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT CAUSALITY BECAUSE ALL OF THESE HORMONES ARE IN A VERY INTRICATE CROSTALK WITH ONE ANOTHER WE CAN HOWEVER MAKE A VERY GENERAL STATEMENT WHICH IS THAT WHEN YOU ARE IN STATES OF STRESS FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME THAT IS NOT A FAVORABLE CONDITION FOR ERMIUN SYSTEM YOUR HORMONE SYSTEM OR FRANKLY ANY OTHER SYSTEM IN THE BRAIN AND BODY SO THE TREATMENT OF EIGHTY EIGH C WITH THESE DRUGS SHOULD NEVER BE DONE AT THE EXPENSE OF THESE OTHER CRITICAL BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS ANOTHER COMMON QUESTION AND CONCERN IS WHETHER R NOT KIDS I SUPPOSE FOR THAT MATTER ADULTS THAT TAKE MEDICATION FOR EIGHTY H T ARE BASICALLY BEING PREDISPOSED TO PSYCHOSIS AND OR OTHER FORMS OF ADDICTION AND EARLY ARE WE TALKED A BIT ABOUT THE RISK FOR A DICTION AND THE TAKO MESSAGE THERE IS VERY CLEAR THAT KIDS AND ADULTS THAT ARE TREATED FOR ADIH T APPROPRIATELY WITH THE APPROPRIATE DOSAGE OF THE APPROPRIATE DRUGS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF ABORD CERTIFIED QUALIFIED PSYCHITRIS ARE AT LESS RISK FOR FORMING ADDICTIONS TO OTHER SUBSTANCES IN ADULTHOOD OR OTHER SUBSTANCES GENERALLY I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ALSO WONDER WHETHE OR NOT THOSE KIDS AND THOSE ADULTS THAT TAKE THE  EIGHTY EIGHT T MEDS BECOME ADDICTED TO THE MEDICATIONS THEMSELVES IT'S A BIT OF A TRICKY ISSUE TO RESOLVE ANY TIME ONE STOPS TAKING A DRUG OR EVEN TAPERS OFF A DRUG THAT'S USED TO TREAT SOMETHING WHERE THEY FEEL BETTER ON THE DRUG THEY ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE TWO SETS OF EFFECTS AND THESE TWO SETS OF EFFECTS ARE OFTEN CONFOUNDED WITH ONE ANOTHER ONE IS THE WITHDRAWAL EFFECTS SO THE EFFECTS OF REMOVING THE DRUG THAT MAKES SOMEBODY FEEL LESS GOOD THAN BASE LINE SO FOR INSTANCE A KID THAT TAKES EGHTY H T MEDS UNTIL THEIRE LATEENS OR EARLY TWENTIETS DECIDES THE'RE GOING TO TAPER OFF THEY DO THAT AND THEIR FEELING LOUSY DURING THE TAPER OR WHEN THEY REDUCE THEIR DOSAGE TO ZERO THEIR IN FOGGY BRAIN THEY CAN'T FOCIS THEY FEEL  BIT DEPRESSED MOOD IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT THOSE ARE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS OR WHETHER OR NOT THOSE OF THE CONSEQUENCE OF NOT HAVING THE SYSTEMS IN THEIR BRAIN ACTIVATED THE WAY THAT THOSE SYSTEMS WERE ACTIVATED BEFORE I REALIZE THAT FOR SOME OF YOU THAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE THE SAME THING BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME THING AND PROBABLY THE BEST ANALOGY WOULD BE SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF A HANG OVER RIGHT IF SOMEBODY DRINKS TOO MUCH ON A GIVEN NIGHT THE NEXT MORNING THEY HAVE A HANG OVER THE HANG OVER MAKES THEM FEEL LOUSY IT'SIT IS ACTUALYA WITHDRAWAL FROM ALCOHOL EFFECT BUT THEN WHEN THEY RECOVER FROM THE HANG OVER THEY REALIZE THAT THEIR SOBER STATE THAT FEELS PRETTY GOOD IT DOESN'T OBVIOUSLY FEEL THE SAME AS BEING ON ALCOLL BUT THAT SOBER STATE IS NOT A STATE OF WITHDRAWAL O CAY IF WE ARE TO LOOK AT REMOVAL OR TAPERING OFF OF EIGHTY EIGHT STMEDS THERE'S GOING TO BE A PERIOD OF WITH DRAWL SYMPTOMS BUT THEN THE REAL QUESTION IS HOW TO SOMEBODY FEEL AFTER THEY GET THROUGH THOSE WITH DRAWAL SYMPTOMS SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE O HIGHLIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF PSYCHOSIS THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING AND VERY IMPORTANT LITERATURE FIRST OF ALL ANY EMPHETOMINE WHETHER NAS D EMPHEDAMINE ELEMPHEDAMINE AND ALSO METHELPHENIDATE FOR THAT MATTER RIDDLIN CAN INDUCE PSYCHOSIS NOW THERE ARE NUMBER DFFERENT FACTORS THAT ARE GOING TO PREDISPOSE SOMEBODY TO PSYCHOSIS HAVING A FIRST RELATIVE WHOSE HAD PSYCHOTIC EPISODES EITHER SKETSOPHRENIC EPISODES OR BY POLLAR EPISODES IS CERTAINLY A STRONG PREDISPOSITION OF COURSE OF AN INDIVIDUAL THEMSELVES HAVE HAD PSYCOTIC EPISODES THAT'S THE STRONGEST PREDISPOSITION THAT ONE CAN IMAGINE SO HAVING A FIRST RELATIVE WITH SGITSOPHRENIA OR WITH BY POLAR DEPRESSION OR  SOMETIMES CALLED BY POLAR DISORDER SOMETIMES IT'S ALSO JUST CALLED BY POLAR THESE DAYS IS GOING TO BE A STRONG PREDISPOSITION FOR PSYCHOTIC EPISODES MADE MUCH GREATER ANY TIME ONE TAKES A SYMPATHEMEMETIC DRG SUCH AS EMPHEDAMINE BUT ALSO METHELPHENADATE RIDDLAN IS GOING TO INCREASE THAT LIKELIHOOD OF PSYCHOTIC EPISODES THEN COMES THE QUESTION OF IF SOMEBODY HAS A PSYCHOTIC EPISODE AS THE CONSEQUENCE OF TAKING ANY OF THESE DRUGS WHETHER NOT IT'S BEEN PRESCRIBED FOR EIGHTY EIGHST OR NOT WILL THOSE PSYCHOTIC PSYMPTOMS GO AWAY AFTER THE PERSON STOPS TAKING THE DRUG THERE APPEARS TO BE A DIVIDE IN THE LITERATURE OR RATHER A DIVIDE ACCORDING TO DRUG SUCH THAT PEOPLE THAT TAKE RIDDLIN METHELPHENIDATE AND HAVE A PSYCHOTIC EPISODE OFTEN NOT ALWAYS BUT MOST OFTEN IF THEY STOP TAKING METHELPHENADATE THE PSYCOTIC EPISODE WILL CEASE NOT ALWAYS THE CASE BUT MOST OFTENTIMES IT WILL CEASE WHEREAS IN INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE A PREDISPOSITION TO PSYCHOSIS OR EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT AWARE OF A PREDISPOSITION O PSYCHOSIS AND THEY TAKE ATERAL WHICH AS YOU RECALL HIS A COMMINATION OF D AND ELEMPHEDAMINE THEY CAN HAVE PSYCHOTIC EPISODES THAT SOMETIMES ARE VERY LONG LASTING EVEN AFTER THE CESSATION OF THE DRUG AND WHILE THAT MIGHT SOUND KIND OF SHOCKING AND REALLY SCARY AND INDEED IT IS SCARY IT PERHAPS SHOULDN'T SHOCK US THAT MUCH BECAUSE IF YOU RECALL D AMPHEDAMINE WHICH THERE IS A LOT OF IN ATERAL IT'S A VERY POTENT WAY OF INCREASING DOPAMINE AND ANY TIME YOU POTENTLY INCREASE DOPAMINE IN A PERSON WHO HAS A PREDISPOSITION TO PSYCHOTIC EPISODES YOU ARE SHIFTING THE WHOLE SYSTEM TOWARD A GREATER PROPENSITY FOR PSYCHOSIS THIS WOULD ALSO BE THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO TALK ABOUT METH METHAMPHEDAMINE GAN METHAM PHEDAMINE IS CONSIDERED AN ELICIT DRUG A DRUG OF ABUSE IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF THE MISFORTUNE AND TRAGEDY THAT YOU SEE ON THE STREETS OF MAJOR CITIES AND EVEN OUTSIDE OF MAJOR CITIES IN RURAL AREAS IT HAS ALL SORTS OF NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON HEALTH INCLUDING ORAL HEALTH CARDIVASCULAR HEALTH O IT IS NEURO TOXIC TO SIR TENERGIC NERONS BUT KILLS CERATONANERONS THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR IT KILLS DOPAMINERGICNERONS THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR ONE OF THE WYS THAT METHAM PHEDAMINE CREATE SO MANY OF THE PROBLEMS THAT IT DOES ANIUNG EFFECTS ON THE BODY ABUSE POTENTIAL ADDICTIVE POTENTIAL THE FACT THAT METHAM PHEDAMINE CAN SPARK PSYCHOSIS IN THOSE THAT HAVE A PREDISPOSITION TO PSYCHOSIS BUT ALSO THAT IT CAN CREATE PSYCHOSIS IN INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NO PREDISPOSITION TO PSYCHOSIS AND ALL OF THIS POINTS TO METHAMPHEDAMINE JUST BEING A TERRIBLE DRUG ALL AROUND AND YET IF YOU RECALL BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE THERE IS ONE FORM OF PRESCRIPTION METHAMPHEDAMINE BUT ITS USES ARE EXTREMELY NARROW AND ITS PROBABLY BEST LEFT OUT OF THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE ITS USE S ARE SO SO NARROW IN THE CLINICAL SENSE I MANGE STO TALK TO ONE EXPERT THIS IS A BORD CERT IFIED PSYCHOTRIS WHOSE EXPERT IN EIGHTY EIGHTY WHO WAS ALSO VER Y FAMILIAR WITH THE PSYCHOSIST SYMPTEMS INDUCED BY METHEMPHEDEMINE AND BY VARIOUS EIGHTY EIGHTST DRUGS AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE PREDISPOSITION THEY MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT ANY OF THE SYMPATHEMAND METIC EIGHTY EIGHT ST DRUGS THAT ARE OF THE AMPHEDEMINE VARIETY SO THAT WOULD BE ATERALL AND EXTENDED RELEASE ATERALL WOLL BE PURE DEXIDRON OR ANY VARIANCE THAT INCLUDE AMPHEDEMINE ARE GOING TO HAVE HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF INDUCING PSYCHOSIS IN PEOPLE THAT HAVE A PREDISPOSITION OF PSYCHOSIS AND YET THEY DID ASSURE ME THAT AT APPROPRIATELY PRESCRIBED AND SAFE DOSAGES THAT THE TOTAL INSIDENCE OF PSYCHOSIS IN  PEOPLE THAT TAKE THOSE DRUGS IS STILL FAIRLY LOW AND NOT THAT MUCH GREATER THAN IN THE GENERAL POPULATION ALTHOUGH THERE IS AN INCREASED RISK IT'S NOT THAT SEVERE AND THEY ALSO HIGHLATE THE FACT THAT METHELHENIDAE RIDLAN CARRIES A LOWER POTENTIAL FOR INDUCING PSYCHOSIS NOT ZERO BUT A LOWER LEVEL INDUING PSYCHOSIS THAN FOR THE INPHEDEMINE TYPES IN PATHEMEMETICS NOW ONE EXCEPTION IS A VIVANTS THAT LONG RELEASE THE AMPHEDEMIGE THAN WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOMETHING PROTECTIVE ABOUT THAT LONG DURATION RELEASE OF DE AMPHEDEMINGE THAT OCCURS WITH VIVANTS WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT THERE'S ZERO ABUSE OR ADDICTIVE POTENTIAL WITH VIVANTS OM I WAS TOLD BY THIS SAME INDIVIDUAL THAT INDEED OM THEY'VE HAD KNOWLEDGE OF PATIENTS TRYING TO INCREASE THE RATE ABABSORPTION OF VIVANTS AND RELEASE OF VIVANS OR TECHNICALLY OF THE D' AMPHEDEMINE IN ORDER TO GET MORE OF A HIGH FROM VIVANTS AS OPPOS TO JUSTTHE EXTENDED RELEASE BUT THEY DID ASSURE ME HOWEVER THAT VIVANT SEEMS TO BE ASSOCIATE WITH FEWER PSYCHOTIC EPISODES AND LESS ABUSE AND ADDICTIVE POTENTIAL OVER ALL WHICH AGAIN IS NOT TO SAY THAT IT'S A PERFECTLY SAFE DRUG BUT REALLY THIS JUST HIGHLITS THE FACT THAT THE CANETICS ARE THE TIME COURSE OF DOPOMINE AND NORIPANEPHRAN RELEASE THAT'S CAUSED BY A GIVEN DRUG IS GOING TO CORRELATE VERY STRONGLY WITH ITS ABUSE POTENTIAL AND ADD CTIVE POTENTIAL AND IT'S POTENTIAL TO INDUCE PSYCOTIC EPISODES AND THIS IS WHERE THE DISCUSSION ABOUT METH BECOMES ESPECIALLY RELEVANT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY METH IS SO DANGEROUS IN TERMS OF IT'S ADDICTIVE POTENTIAL AND IT'S POTENTIAL TO INDUCE PSYCOTIC EPISODES IS FIRST OF ALL HOW MUCH DOPAMINE IT RELEASES AGAIN FIVE TIMES MORE THAN ANY OF THE OTHER DRUGSTHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BUT ALSO HOW FAST THAT PEAK COMES ON IT'S A VERY FAST ONSET AND THAT'S TRUE WHETHER NOT PEOPLE ARE SNORTING IT THOUT THEIRE TAKING EARLIOR ESPECIALY IF THEY INJECT IT INTRIVANEOUSLY BUT METH BECAUSE IT INCREASES DOPAMINES SO FAST INTO SUCH A DEGREAT DEGREE AND THEN THE THE PEAK AN DOPAMIN COMES DOWN VERY FAST AS WELL AND IT DROPS BELOW THE BASE LINE LEVELS OF DOPAMING THAT WERE AT PRESENT INITIALLY THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY METHAM PHEDAMINA SO DANGEROUS IN TERMS OF ADDICTION AND IN TERMS OF PSYCOTIC EPISODES  THIS GETS BACK TO A BUNCH OF ISSUES WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE ON THE HUBERUMAN LABPODCASTS ABOUT DOPAMINE CANETICS AND I'VE DONE TWO EPISODES ON DOPAMINE THAT ILL REFER YOU TO ONE IS CALLED DOPAMIN MOTIVATION AND DRIVE WHICH IS ALL ABOUT DOPAMIN AND REGULATING DOPAMINE AND THE OTHER ONE IS ABOUT OPTIMIZING DOPAMINE IT'S MORE VOTOOL KIT FOCUSED EPISODE BOTH THOSE WHO CON FIND AT HUBRUMAN LABDOT COMBUT THE GENERAL TAKE AWAY THAT'S RELEVANT FOR WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT NOW IS THAT WITH DOPAMING IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE ABSOLUTE LEVELS OF DOPAMI THAT ARE REACH BUT HOW LONG LASTING THOSE INCREASES IN DOPAMINE ARE SO WITH VIVEANTS EVEN THOUGH VIVE ANS IS D AMPHEDAMINE IT'S FAIRLY POTENT OT IS POTENT AS METH BUT FAIRLY POTINET INCREASING DOPAMIN IE NOREPAN EFREN IT'S A LONG EXTENDED RELEASE IN DOPAMINE THE NOREPAN EFRON WHICH REDUCES ITS OVER ALL ABUSE POTENTIAL BECAUSE IT DOESN INTEND TO CREATE THAT IMMEDIATE EUPHORIA AND HIGH AND THEN PCRASH BELOW BASE LINE LOT OF VIEUW WILL HEAR THAT IT INCREASES DOPAMIN A LOT AND THEN STAYS UP AS TRANSLATING TO OKE WELL THEN YOU'RE JUST EUPHORIC FOR SIXTEEN HOURS BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE WHEN IT COMES TO DOPAMINE IT'S AN ISSUE OF HOW HIGH THAT PEAK IS AND WHETHER NOT THAT P IS STABLE OR WHEN N IT COMES DOWN AGAIN AND WHEN IT COMES TO PSYCOTIC EPISODES OR ADDICTIVE POTENTIAL IT SEEMS THAT ANY DRUG OR BEHAVIOR THE INCREASES DOPOMING VERY QUICKLY AND THEN BRINGS DOPOMINE DOWN VERY QUICKLY IS WHAT SETS THE HIGH POTENTIAL FOR ADDICTION AND ABUSE AND FOR INDUCING PSYCOTIC EPISODES SO THAT'S WHY AM TALKING ABOUT THESE TWO THINGS IN PARALLEL AND NOW IT SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR WHY VIVANTS DOESN'T HAVE SO MUCH ADDICTIVE IN ABUCE POTENTIAL AND HAS AT LEAST LOWER POTENTIAL FOR INDUCING PSYCOTIC EPISODES AND IT SHOULD ALSO BE CLEAR TO YOU THAT FOR PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE EIGHTY EIGHT STE AS A CHILD OR FOR PEOPLE THAT DO NOT HAVE EIGHTY EIGHTSTE IN ADULTHOOD IF THEY WERE TO TAKE ANY TRULY ANY OF THE COMPOUNDS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT THUS FAR METHELPHENADATE RIDDLIN ADERAL VIVANTS DEXODRINE AND CERTAINLY MET THEM PHEDAMINE WHAT WE OBSERVE FROM NARRO IMAGING STUDIES IS THAT THESE PEOPLE GET ENORMOUS INCREASES IN DOPAMINE THEY ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THESE DRUGS SO THAT INCREASES IN DOPOMINE ARE JUST COSMIC FOR THEM THEY EXPERIENCE A LOT OF EUPHORIA EVEN IF THE DOSAGES ARE LOW THE EUPHORIAS ASSOCIATE WITH THI VERY HEIGHTENED DEGREE OF FOCUST THEY NEVER REALLY FELT BEFORE HEAR WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS A LOT OF THE RECREATIONAL AND OFF PRESCRIPTION USE OF ADERAL AND THINGS LIKE IT AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THAT SETS IN MOTION BOTH A POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE AND ADDICTION TO THAT FEELING AND SUBSTANCE AS WELL AS A HIGHER POTENTIAL FOR PSYCOTIC EPISODES DOWN THE ROAD HESO PUT DIFFERENTLY CHILDREN WHO HAVE ADEASTY AND ARE PRESCRIBED ANY OF THESE DRUGS OR ADULT WHO HAVE EIGHTY EIGHT SHEE AND ARE PRESCRIBED ANY OF THESE DRUGS WHO TAKE THEM FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME ARE ACTUALLY AT LESS OR RISK TO ALL OF THE ISSUES RELATED TO HAVING CHRONICALLY ELEVATED AND GREATLY ELEVATED DOPOMINE AS A CIFIRST TIME O V NT OR AS A RARE EVENT WHEREAS ANYONE WHO TAKES THESE DRUGS WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION AND BESIDES O CA WONE A FOCUS MORE I AM GOING TO USES TO STAY UP FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS ANOTHERWARDS USING IT RECREATIONALLY OR USING IT FOR GOINQ PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT IS THAT FAR GREATER RISK FOR ADDICTION TO THESE SUBSTANCES BECAUSE OF THE AMPLITUDE AND THE TIME COURSE OF DOPOMINE THAT RESULTS WHEN ONE TAKES THESE DRUGS JUST OUT OF THE BLUE AND SO FOR THAT REASON I REALLY ON A CAUTION EVERYBODY AGAINST USING ANY OF THE COMPOUNDS THAT I'VE DISCUSSED THUS FAR UNLESS IT'S BEEN PRESCRIBED TO YOU BY A PHYSICIAN FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE OF EIGHTY H T NOWI'M SURE SOME ONE OUT THERE S SCREAMING FROM THE BACK WAIT IF A KID TAKES THESE DRUGS BECAUSE THEYRE PRESCRIBED THEM FOR EIGHTY H T THE VERY FIRST TIME THEY TAKE THEM THEYRE CAN HAVE A HUGE AMPLITUE DOPAMINE RESPONSE OR OF AN ADULT GOES IN AND TALKS TO THEIR PSYCHITRIS AND SOCENIM HAVENT ISSUES WITH FOCUSING IN THEIR PRESCRIBED ONE OF THESE MEDS FOR EIGHT GHTY AND THEY TAKE IT THEY'E GON TO HAVE A HUGE AMPLITUE DOPAMINE RESPONSE ISN'T THAT GOING TO SET IN MOTION ALL THE SAME THINGS THAT SOMEBODY WHO IS USING THESE DRUGS RECREATIONALLY WOULD HAVE AND INDEED THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY A LOT OF PSYCHOTRIS WILL START WITH A VERY LOW DOSAGE OR THE LOWEST POSSIBLE DOSAGE TO SEE HOW SOMEBODY RESPONDS THAT LOW DOSAGE AND THEN OVER TIME MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT INCREASE THAT DOSAGE IN FACT THEY MIGHT EVEN BRING IT DOWN FURTHER DEPENDING ON HOW SENSITIVE SOMEBODY IS TO THE DRUG BUT EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS THE FACT THAT IT IS THE REPEATED TAKING OF THAT DRUG BY THE CHILD WITH EIGHTY EIGH T OR BY THE ADULT WITH EIGHTY EIGHT S THAT ACTUALLY LEADS TO LESSER AND LESSER PEAKS IN DOPOMINE EACH TIME WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT THE PERSON BECOMES ENTIRELY DESENSITIZE TO THE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG BUT RATHER THAT THE SYSTEM EQUILIBRATES THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED HOMIOSTATIC PLASTICITY SOMETIMES REFERRED TO BROADLY AS HABITUATION TO A DRUG BUT THERE ARE SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT REGULATE THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NURONS SO THAT IF DOPAMING EN NOREPAN EFFRAN ARE ELEVATED ABOVE BASELINE LEVELS FOR A WHILE THE SYSTEM NORMALIZES SO THAT INSTEAD THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NURONS BECOME STRONGER AND THERE ISN'T THE CRITICAL REQUIREMENT FOR ALL THAT INCREASE IN DOPAMINA NOREPANEFFRAN I REALIZE THAT MIGHT SOUNDAL TECHNICAL BUT BASICALLY WHAT I AM SAYING IS THE RESPONSE THAT SOMEBODY HAS TO TAKING A DRUG FOR THE FIRST TIME IS FAR AND AWAY DIFFERENT THEN THE RESPONSE TO A DRUG THAT SOMEBODY HAS IF THEY ARE TAKING THE SAME DRUG DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY THIS GETS TO ANOTHER ISSUE WHICH IS NOT DISCUSSED THAT OFF IN THESE DAYS BUT THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT YOU GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL CLENICAL LITERATURE ON THESE SYMPATHEMEMETICS WT YOU'LL FIND IS THAT THE ORIGINAL USE OF THESE SYMPATHEMEMETICS TO TREAT CHILDHOOD EIGHTY EIGHTSTY SUGGESTED THAT CHILDREN NOT TAKE THESE DRUGS EVERY SINGLE DAY NOW I'M NOT RECOMMENDING THAT KIDS TAKE DRUG HOLIDAYS BECAUSE I'M NOT A CLINITION I'M NOT PROMOTING ANY SPECIFIC DOSE OR DOSING REGIMENT BUT IN SPEAKING AGAIN TO A PSYCHATRIST EXPERT IN EIGHTY EIGHTSTY WHO BY THE WAY IS GOING TO BE A GUEST ON THIS PODCAST IN THE NOT TOWO DISTANT FUTURE WHAT HE TOLD ME WAS THAT MANY OF THESE DRUGS WERE DESIGN TO BE TAKEN DURING THE SCHOOL WEEK FOR CHILDREN WITH WEAK ENDS OFF OR DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR WHICH WEAKENS OFF BUT THEN ALSO WITH VACATIONS DURING THE SUMMER HOLIDAYS AND THAT THESE DAYS RARELY IF EVER IS THAT THE PATTERN OF IN TAKE THAT THESE KIDS ARE FOLLOWING AND WHY THAT IS HAS INTERESTING SOCIOLOGICAL AND FINANCIAL EXPLANATIONS NOT ALLUDING TO ANY KIND OF CONSPIRACY HERE BUT THIS IS AN ASPECT OF THE DOSING WITH THESE DRUGS THAT IS ORFALLEN AWAY IN RECENT YEARS AH BUT I THINK IS REALLY INTERESTING AND IT SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY WAS SUPPORTED FOR THE TREATMENT OF A DULT EIGHTY EIGHTSTY AS WELL AGAIN THERE IS A VERY DIFFERENT BIOLOGICAL AND NEURL PLASTIC RESPONSE TO TAKING A DRUG ONCE VERSES TAKING A DRUG FOR S AY FIVE DAYS IND THE TAKING WEAKENS OFF TO TAKING A DRUG OVER AND OVER AGAIN EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR A PATTERN OF YEARS AND WHEN EXPLORING THE LITERATURE AN PREPARATION FOR THIS EPISODE I CONFESS IT WAS A BIT DIZZYING TO FIND ANSWERS TO WHAT ARE THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF TAKING ADERAL OR WHAT ARE THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF TAKING VIVE ANTS ET CETERA IN FACT MOST OF THE LITERATURE ON THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF TAKING DRUGS TO TREAT EIHTY EIGH T HAS FOCUS ON METHELFENIDA ON RIDDLAN THERE ARE STUDIES ON VIVE ANTS AND ATURAL AND ACTUALLY THOSE WERE THE STUDIES A THAT I WILL LINK IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS PRIMARILY CAUSE THAT'S WHERE MOST OF THE INTEREST AS THESE DAYS THE REASON WHY SO MANY OF THE STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON METHELFENIDA ON RIDDLAN IS LARGELY BECAUSE THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST DRUGS USED TO TREAT EIGHTY EIH T SO IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING LONG TERM EFFECTS OF KIDS TREATED WITH EIGHTY EIGH D MEDS THOSE KIDS ARE NOW ADULTS ON AND THEREFORE CAN BE NARROW IMAGE TON A SESS WHEREAS A LOT OF KIDS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESCRIBED ADERAL OR VIVE ANTS OR SIMILAR HAVE NOT YET MADE IT TO STAGES OF LIFE IN WHICH WE CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION DIRECTLY THERE ARE FEW STUDIES AND I'VE MADE IT CLEAR TO INCLUDE THOSE STUDIES IN MY DESCRIPTION OF RESULTS TO DAY IN PARTICULAR THE RESULT I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WHERE THERE'S AN IMPROVEMENT IN EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN KIDS THAT HAVE TAKEN EIGHTY IGH T MEDS OR ADULTS THAT HAVE TAKEN EIGHTY EIGH T MEDS FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME ANYWHERE FROM MONTHS TO YEARS THOSE STUDIES DID INCLUDE BOTH ADURAL AND VIVE ANTS AND METHELFENIDATE AND AGAIN O LINK TO THOSE STUDIES BUT BY ND LARGE MOST OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF ANY OF THESE DRUGS HAS TO DO PRIMARILY WITH STUDIES OF METHEL FENIDATE I'D LIKE TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT SOME COMPOUNDS THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED AMPHEDAMENES AT ALL BUT THAT ARE NOW BEING USED TO TREAT EIGHTY EIGH T BOTH IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS MORE FREQUENTLY THE MAJOR DRUG IN THIS CATEGORY OF NON ANFEDAMINE TREATMENTS FOR EIGHTY EIGH T IS MODAPHENIL WHICH IS ALSO CALLED BY ITS COMMERCIAL NAME PROVIGIL THERE'S A VARIANCE ON THIS WHICH IS ARMODAPHANIL WHICH GOES BY THE BRAND NAME NEWVIGIL THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MODAPANIL AND ARMODAPHANIL ASIDE FROM HAVING A SLIGHT CHEMICAL DIFFERENCE IS THAT MODAPHINIL WAS RELEASED FIRST ARMODAHANILS THE SECOND IN THE GENERATION OF THESE DRUGS AND MODAPHANIL TENDS TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IT'S PROHIBITIVE FOR SOME PEOPLE TO TAKE IT CAN BE AS EXPENSIVE AS TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A PILL OR MORE TO MORE THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MONTH AND ARMODAPHANL TENDS TO BE FAR FAR LESS EXPENSIVE ITALK TOOCABLE EXPERTS ABOUT WHETHER NOT THERE ARE ANY GENUINE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE TWO DRUGS AND THEY REPORT NO ALTHOUGH CONSUMERS OF THESE DRUGS ORWHATEVER REASON WHETHER NOT SPLACIBO OR NOTH REPORT YES THERE IS A DIFFERENT WHEN I SAY PLACIBO I IN NO WAY MEAN THAT THESE DRUGS ARE JUST ACTING AS PLACIBO I JUST MEAN THAT NO PEOPLE TEND TO GET VERY ATTACHED TO CERTAIN DRUGS AND WHETHER OR NOT THE BRAND NAME OR THE GENERIC VERSION WORKS BETTER FOR THEM THERE'S ALL SORTS OF LOERE ABOUT THIS IN FACT A THERE ARE LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO STRONGLY FEEL THAT BRAND NAME ADARALL WORKS BETTER THAN GENERIC ADARALL FOR THEM THERE R LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT VIVANTS THE LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERES SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT RIDLIN AND ALL SORTS OF DRUGS WHEATHER NOT THAT'S TRUE OR NOT IS UNCLEAR IT IS CLEAR THAT GENERIC VERSIONS OF DRUGS CAN USE BINDERS AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IN THE PILL OR CAPSUL THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE BRANDNAME PILLAR CAPSUL USES AS BINDERS TO HOLD THE DRUG TOGETHER AND THAT CAN IMPACT RATES OF RELEASE AN METABOLISM ET CETERA BUT A LOT OF THIS IS JUST LOER IN FACT I WENT INTO THE LITERATURH O TRY AND FIND ANY REAL CONCRETE SUPPORT FOR THE IDEA THAT GENERIC ADARALL IS LESS POTENT OR LESS EFFECTIVE THAN BRANDAME ADARALL AND DESPITE THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO WILL SAY TO THE CONTRARY I COULD NOT FIND ANY PUREREVIEWED PUBLISHED DATA ABOUT THAT SO WHO KNOWS MAYBE IT'S A BELIEF EFF CT AS IT'S CALLED O MAYBE THERE IS A REAL DIFFERENCE THERE NOWADAYS MODAPHINL AND ARMODAPINAL ARE PRESCRIBED FOR A HUGE RANGE OF DAYTIME SLEEPINESS ISSUES AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT NARCALEPSY BUT THERE ALSO PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM DAYTIME SLEEPINESS RELATED TO DEMENSHA DAYTIME SLEEPINESS RELATED TO POST SURGERY ANASTHISIA E OTHERS THIS THING WHERE PEOPLE HAVE SURGERY AND THN THE COMATO SURGERY AND THEY FEEL BETTER FOR A FEW DAYS BUT THAN THEY FIND THAT THEY AREN'T RECOVERING THEIR NORMAL LEVELS OF WAKEFULNESS SO IT'S PRESCRIBE SOMETIMES TO TRY AND GET PEOPLE BACK INTO A NORMAL STATE OF WAKEFULNESS TO IMPRESCRIBED FOR TRAMATIC HEAD INJURY AFTER STROKE AGAIN ALL OF THE PRESCRIBED USES HALF TO BE CARRIED OUT BY A CERTIFIED PHYSICIAN YOU REALLY DON'T WANT O START COWBOYING ON THE USE OF MODAPHINOR ARMODAPHIN OR ANY OTHER PRESCRIPTION DRUG FOR THAT MATTER MUST SAY THAT IN DISCUSSING ALL THESE DIFFERENT DRUGS DURING TO DAY'S EPISODE I HAVE ZERO KNOWLEDGE OF ANY OF THESE DRUGS FROM A FIRST TAN EXPERIENCE EXCEPT FOR ARMODAPINOL BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN I WAS PRESCRIBED A VERY VERY LOWDOSE OF ARMODAPINO FOR JET LAG FOR DAYTIME SLEEPINESS ISSUES REALLY WHEN I WAS TRAVELLING OVER SEAS TO GIVE A TALK SO ARMODAPHINIL WAS GIVEN TO ME IN A TWENTY FIVE MILIGRAM TABLET IT WAS ADVISED TO ME THAT I TAKE A HALF OR EVEN A QUARTER OF THAT SO I STARTED WITH A QUARTER I AM A BELIEVER IN MINIMAL EFFECTIVE DOSE I'M ALSO SOMEBODY WHOSE FAIRLY HYPER SENSITIVE TO MOST MEDICATION SO I TOOK WHAT I MEASURED OUT TO BE FIVE TO SEVEN MILIGRAMS OF ARMODAPIN AND WHAT I EXPERIENCED WAS PRETTY PROFOUND CERTAINLY IT RELIEVED ANY DAYTIME SLEEPINESS IN FACT IT MADE ME FEEL EXTREMELY ALERT FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT FOUR TO SIX HOURS I CAN'T SAY IT WAS THE MOST COMFORTABLE STATE ALTHOUGH I DID NOT FEEL AS IF I HAD RACING HARD FOR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT IBASELY FELT AS IF I WAS IN A NARROW TUNNEL OF ATTENTION FOR THAT ENTIRE PERIOD ON ONE THING I DID NOT LIKE ABOUT TH Y EXPERIENCE IS THAT IT WAS A VERY HARD EXPERIENCE TO COME DOWN FROM THERE WAS NO CRASH BUT I FOUND THAT THAT HIGHERAWSAL STATE DIDN'T TAPER OFF FOR MANY HOURS LATER EVEN THOUGH IT WAS MOST HIGHTEN FOR FOUR HOURS I WOUD SAY ANYWHERE FROM EIGHT TO TWELVE HOURS LATER I STILL FELT LIKE I WAS OU KNO BLINKING ONCE EVERY FOUR MINUTES OR SO AND I'VE CERTAINLY BEEN ACCUSED ON THIS PODCAST AND AT OTHER TIMES OF BLINKING TO SELDOM A TO MY KNOWLEDGE I DON'T HAVE EIGHTY H T I'VE NEVER BEEN PRESCRIBED EGHTY H T MEDS I'VE NEVER I'VE BEEN TESTED FOR ADY H T I DON'T THINK I HAVE EIGHTY H T AND YET TAKING ARMODAPINEL CERTAINLY INCREASED MY LEVELS OF ATTENSION BUT LEAST BY THAT ONE EXPERIENCE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD WANT TO REPEAT AGAIN I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT WANT TO BE IN THAT STATE FOR LEARNING NEW MATERIAL WHHEN I SIT DOWN TO RESEARCH OF PODCAST OR RESEARCH PAPERS IN MY LAB OR FORAGE FOR INFORMATION OR LEARN FROM PEOPLE AR BOOKS OR LECTURES OR PODCASTS I WANT TO BE IN A STATE OF ALERTNESS BUT CALM WHERE I CAN REALLY CONSIDER THE IDEAS WHERE I CAN SCRIPT THINGS OUT BY HAND AMO BIG BELIEVER IN WRITING THINGS OUT BY HAND TO REMEMBER THEM LATER DRAWING LITTLE DIAGRAMS I WOULD NOT WANT TO BE IN THE STATE THAT EVEN THAT VERY LODOS OF ARMODAPHINL PUT ME IN IN ORDER TO LEARN AND I SHOULD MENTION THAT BOTH MODAPHINL AND ARMODAPHINEL ARE ASSOCIATED WITH GOOD NUMBER OF SIDE EFFECTS IF THEY DON'T AGREE WITH YOU OR IF THE DOSAGE IS TOO HIGH THINGS LIKE DECREASED APETI PEOPLE GET A RUNNING NOS HEADACHE HERE IS THIS A INSTANCE OF SKIN RASHES IN FACT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY MODAPHINEL AND ARMODAPHINEL AREN'T MORE BROADLY PRESCRIBED IS THAT THERE'S A VERY RARE SKIN CONDITION IN WHICH PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAKEN CERTAIN DRUGS NOCHOS MODAHINOR ARMODAPHINEL HAVE DEVELOPED THESE VERY SEVERE BURN TIGHT BLISTERS AND IN SOME CASES THIS CAN BE FATAL THIS IS AGAIN VERY RARE AND IT WAS OBSERVED IN AT LEAST ONE PATIENT A WHO TOOK A MODAPHINEL IS PART OF A TRIAL FOR MODAPHINEL IS A TREATMENT FOR EGHTY H TO IT'S CALLED STEPENS JOHNSON CINDRUM PLEASE IF YOU ARE SQUEAMISH TO IMAGES OF A SKINABRASIONS AND LESIONS AND THINGS OF THAT S ORT PLEASE DON'T LOOK IT UP ON THE INERNET UNLESS A YOUARE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT AND MAY BE NOT AT ALL BUT A THE POINT HERE IS THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT MODAPHNL AND ARMODAPHINEL ARE NOT MORE WIDELY PRESCRIBED FOR EGHTY H T AND THAT IT STILL ONLY PRESCRIBED OFF LABEL IS THAT STEPHENS JOHNSON CYNDRUM WAS FLAG TAS KIND OF A POTENTIAL RISK ALTHOUGH THE EIGHTY GH T SPECIALISTS THAT I SPOKE TO ARE SOMEWHAT FRUSTRADE WITH THAT BECAUSE THEY INSISTS THAT THE FREQUENCY OF THIS A CYNDRUM THAT CAUSES THE SKINRASH THAT SOMETIMES FATAL IS NO MORE FREQUENT IN THOSE THAT TOOK MODAPHINEL IN THIS TRIAL THAN WITH OTHER DRUGS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED SO THIS GETS INTO ALL SORTS OF ISSUES AROUND WHAT DRUGS MAKE IT TO APPROVAL IN WHICH ONES DON'T AND AS WE KNOW MODAPHENON ARMODAPHNEL ARE ALREADY BEING PRESCRIBED IN THE GENERAL POPULATION FOR OTHER THINGS OW THIS WAS DEALING SPECIFICALLY WITH THE QUESTION OF WHETHER NOT SHOULD BE PRESCRIBED IN KIDS WITH EIGHTY GH T AND A CERTAINLY I AM A PROPONENT OF EXERTING EXTREME CAUTION WHEN THINKING ABOUT WHICH DRUG SHOULD BE APPROVED FOR THE TREATMENT OF ANYBODY BUT ESPECIALLY KITS AND TO ROUND OUT OUR DISCUSSION OF DRUGS USED FOR THE TREATMENT OF EIGHTY GH T THAT FALL INTO LET'S CALL IT THE A TYPICAL CATEGORY WRITE THE TYPICAL CATEGORY BEING ATARALL VIVE ENTS ATHOLPENADATE AND THINGS OF THAT VARIETY THE LESS TYPICAL WOULD BE MODAPHINEL ARMODAPHINEL BROPRIREN WOBUTREN AND SO FORTH THE LAST IN THIS CATEGORY OF A TYPICAL IS GUANPACINE GUANPACINE IS AN INTERESTING COMPOUND IT'S A COMPOUND THAT WAS DEVELOPED TO LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE AND INDEED IT DOES LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE AND IT IS AN ALPATO A AGONIST ALPATUA BEING A RECEPTER FOR NOR EPINEPRAN SO GUANPHACINE IS A NON STIMULANT MEDICATION TO TREAT EIGHTY H T AND IT'S ALSO USED TO TREAT SOME OTHER CONDITIONS AS WELL THAT IS ONLY WORKING ON THE NORAGRONERGIC SYSTEM AND IS NOT TAPPING IN TO THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM BUT ALL THE OTHER STUFF THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IS REALLY RAMPING UP DOPOMINE AND NORUPANEFERON GUANPACINE IS ONLY INCREASING NORP IN EFFRAN AND ITS DOING SO BY WHAT WE SAY AGONIZING OR STIMULATING ONE PARTICULAR ASPECT OF THE NORAGERONERGIC SYSTEM AN THAT'S THE ALPHITUA SYSTEM WHAT'S INTERESTINE ABOUT GUANPHACINE IS THAT IT HAS A BUNCH OF PATHWAYS THAT IT ACTIVATES THAT FEED BACK ON TO THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM TO DAMPEN DOWN THE ACTIVATION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM SO WHEREAS MOST OF WHAT WE TALK ABOUT TO DAY ARE SYMPATHOMEMETICS THAY CAN TO MAKE US MORE RAMPED UP OR AROUSED AND ALERT GUANPHACINE IS DOING THE OPPOSITE AND AS A CONSEQUENCE IT'S NOT PRESCRIBED THAT OFTEN BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN PEOPLE TAKE GUANPHASINE IT EITHER HAS NO EFFECT ON EIGHTY EIGHTTY SYMPTEMS OR TTENDS TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL VERY SLEEPY HOWEVER THERE IS A SMALL SUBSET OF INDIVIDUALS ABOUT FIVE TO TEN PER CENT OF PEOPLE THAT TRY IT INCLUDING KIDS THAT DO GET SOME SIGNIFICANT RELIEF FROM THEIR EIGHTY EIGHTY SYMPTEMS AND THEY SEEM TO TOLERATE GUAPHA SIME BETTER THAN THEIR TOLERATING SOME OF THE OTHER DRUGS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT UP UNTIL NOW THE WAGUANPHACINE WORKS IS ALSO REALLY INTERESTING YOU'RE NOW  FAMILIAR WITH THE LOCUS SERULIUS THIS PACKET OR WE CALL IT A NUCLEUS OF NURONS IN THE BACK OF THE BRAIN THAT RELEASE NORUP IN EFFRAN AT OTHER SIGHTS IN THE BRAIN AND THERE CAN TO BE THOSE ALPATUA RECEPTERS THAT GUANPHACINE WORKS ON AND STIMULATES LOTS OF DIFFERENT PLACES IN THE BRAIN RELATED TO INCREASING SALIENS AND A RELEVANTS OF PARTICULAR TIMULA THAT WE SEE N THAT WE NEED TO ATTEND TO IT APPEARS THAT GUAPHACINE CAN ACTIVATE THE PREFRUNTAL QORTICAL NETWORKS IN WAYS THAT ARE ABOVE THEIR NORMAL BASE LINE SO THAT'S GOOD SO IMPROVEMENTS AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION THAT ORCHESTRA OR TEACHER LIKE FUNCTION WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE AND CAN INCREASE THE EFFICACI OF THAT OUTPUT FROM LOCUS SERULIUS AND WHAT THAT SEEMS TO DO IS INCREASE THE CORDINATED FIRING OF LOCUS RULAS NURONS WITHPRE FRONT OF QUARTEC SO IN MANY WAYS IT'S ACTING LIKE A FINE TUNING OF THAT ORCHESTRA CONDUCTOR OPERATION THAT IS SO VALUABLE IN TEACHING THESE BRAIN CIRCUITS DURING CHILDHOOD OF HOW TO ATTEND TO ONE THING AND IGNORE EVERYTHING ELSE SO THIS IS ONE REASON WHY GUANFASINE IS NOW APPROVE NOT JUST FOR ADULTS WITH EIGHTY EIGHT ST BUT IS PRIMARILY USED IN KIDS AGED SIX TO SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD FOR THE TREATMENT OF EIGHTY EIGHT ST AGAIN WITH THE HOPE THAT THESE KIDS CAN TAKE THE DRUG IN THESE CIRCUITS CAN LEARN HOW TO FOCUS AND HOW TO ATTEN TO CERTAIN THINGS AND LIMIT IMPULSIVITY AND HIPERACTIVITY AND THEN PERHAPS COME OFF THE DRUGS ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES AGAIN PEOPLE HAVE TO STAY ON THEM INDEFINITELY THE OTHER THING ABOUT GUAPACINE IS THAT BECAUSE IT LOWERS BLOOD PRESSURE AND IT HAS THIS EFFECT OF DAMPENING DOWN OVER ALL SYMPATHETIC AROUSAL SOMETIMES IT IS PRESCRIBED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER EIGHTY EIGHT ST MEDS SO YES THERE ARE KIDS OUT THERE AND ADULTS OUT THERE WHO ARE TAKING ATARAL ENGUANFASINE OR THEIR TAKING VIVE ANTS ENGUANFASINE AND THIS SWHERE IT STARTS TO GET IN TO DRUG COCKTAILS AND A BUNCH OF OTHER A THINGS THAT GET EVERYBODY A LITTLE BUT UNCOMFORTABLE I THINK BECAUSE THE IDEA OF TAKING ONE DRUG TO DAMPEN DOWN THE SIDE EFFECTS OF ANOTHER DRUG AND TO OFFSET THINGS IN CONPASATE YOU KNOW T IS GETTING TOWARDS WHAT'S CALL POLLY PARMACOLOGY AND YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT PEOPLE BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND YET GAN IN VIEWING THIS WITH SOME OF THE EXPERTS ON EIGHTY EIGHT SE THER DO SEEM TO BE A CERTAIN CATEGORY OF CHILDREN OUT THERE AN ADULTS WHO REALLY STRUGGLE WITH THE STANDARD EIGHTY EIGHT ST MEDS AND IN THAT CASE GUANFASINE HAS PROVIDED A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THESE INDIVIDUALS TREMENDOUS RELIEF ONE KNOTE ABOUT GUNASINE IN NO WAY SHAE PERFORM IN MY ENCOURAGING ANYONE WHO'S NOT PRESCRIBED GUANFASINE TO TAKE IT BUT SHOULD YOU KNOW SOME ONE WHOSE TAKING GUANFASINE OFF LABEL IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THEIR FOCUS OR INHENCE ANY ASPECT OF THEIR BIOLOGY OR PSYCHOLOGY OF PLEASE LET THEM KNOW THAT IT HAS A PROFOUND EFFECT ON LOWERING THE TOLERANCE FR ALCALL SUCH THAT EVEN SMALL AMOUNTS OF ALCOHOL CAN LEAD TO REALLY SERIOUS PROBLEMS AND EVEN POTENTIALLY DEATH SO THAT'S A VERY CEROUS WARNING WITH GUONPHYSY SO TO DAY WE DISCUSSED A LOT OF DIFFERENT COMPOUNDS FOR THE TREATMENT OF HD H T AND IT NOW SHOULD BECOME CLEAR WHAT THE GENERAL THEMES OF THOSE COMPOUNDS IS THE GENERAL THEME IS THAT THEY TEND TO INCREASE OVER ALL LEVELS OF AROUSAL AND WAKEFULNESS WHICH LEADS TO DECREASE LEVELS OF HYPER ACTIVITY IMPULSIVITY AND FOCUS AND ON THE FACE OF IT THAT MIGHT SEEM COUNTER INTUITIVE RAISE AROUSAL TO REDUCE HYPER ACTIVITY AND IMPULSIVITY INDEED THAT'S THE CASE BECAUSE THESE COMPOUNDS BECAUSE THEY ACT ON NEURO MODULATOR SYSTEMS LIKE DOPEMINE AND NORUP AN EFRON ARE EFFECTIVE IN CREATING NEUROW PLASTICITY THEY CHANGE THE STRENGTH OF THE CONNECTIONS IN THE NERAL CIRCUITS OF THE BRAIN THAT LEAD TO STATES OF HEIGHTENED FOCUS AND REDUCED IMPULSIVITY AND REDUCE HYPERACTIVITY SO WE TALKED ABOUT THE DFFERENT MECHANISMS BY WHICH THE DIFFERENT MEDICATIONS FRADY H T ACCOMPLISH THIS BOTH THE TYPICAL SORT LIKE METHELPHENADATE AN ATERAL AND VIVANCS AND SOME OF THE ATYPICAL COMPOUNDS THAT ARE NOW BEING USED IN ADDITION SUCH AS MODAPHINEL ARE MODAPHIDEL GUONPACINE AND WELL BUTRON AND WHERE POSSIBLE I TRIED TO HIGHLIGHT BOTH THE SHORT AND LONG TERM EFFECTS OF THESE VARIOUS COMPOUNDS AND I TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE MAJOR CONCERNS ABOUT THESE COMPOUNDS MOST NOTABLY THE QUESTION OF WIRE WE PUTTING SO MANY KIDS ON AMPHETAMINE AND WHAT IS THE LONTERM CONSEQUENCE OF THAT AND THROUGHOUT TO DHAYSE EPISODE I TRIED TO HIGHLIGHT BOTH THE IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM BENEFITS BUT ALSO THE IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM RISKS THAT CAN EXIST WITH THESE COMPOUNDS CERTAINLY WHEN TAKE IN WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION RECREATIONALLY THERE IS A REAL RISK FOR ABUSE AND ADDICTION AS WELL AS VEN A RISK FWOR PSYCOTIC EPISODES BUT ALSO THE RISTS THAT ACCOMPANY LONG TERM USE OF THESE DRUGS IN PEOPLE WITH EIGHTY EIGH T AND YET IT IS ALSO CLEAR THAT NOT TREATING THE SYMPTOMS OF EGHDY H T CARRY SIGNIFICANT RISK AS WELL AND WHAT'S VERY CLEAR FROM THE SCIENTIFIC AND CLINICAL LITERATURE AND IS COVERED IN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DETAIL IN THE EPISODE THAT I DID ABOUT EIGHTY H T WHICH YOU CAN FIND AT HUBERMAN LAB DOT COM IS THAT COMMINATIONS OF DRUG TREATMENTS AND BEHAVORO PROTOCOLS SEEM TO SURPASS EITHER DRUG TREATMENTS OR BEHAVORO PROTOCOLS ALONE SPEAKING TO THE TREMENDOUS IMPORTANCE OF COMBINING MALTIPLE METHODOLOGIES WHEN TREATING EIGHTY H T AN WORKING WITH

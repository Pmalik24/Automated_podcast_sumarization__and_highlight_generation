THEIR LICENSES WHEN THEY BEHAVE BADWAY EVERY STATE HAS THESE MEDICAL BOARDS THE GRAND MEDICAL LICENSES AND THERE THE ONES RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING THEM AWAY WE HEARD ABOUT ALL THIS FROM A WALE PROFESSOR AT VANDERBELT REBECCA ALLAN'S WORDS AND TWHENTY ATEEN SHE STRARTOF GOING TO MEDICAL BOARD HERINGS AN TENNESSEE WHERE SHE LIVES IT WAS RESER FOR A BOOK THAT CHIPLANS TO WRITE ABOUT LICENSING BOARDS AND WHAT SHE SAW WHEN SHE GOT THERE HORRIFIED HER THE MATER IS IS COTIC FROPER WHEN IT COMES TO THE TENNESSEY BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS REBECCA IS LIKE THE ONE DIE HARD FAN IN THE STANS AT A TOWNSOFF BALL GAME SHE KNOWS ALL THE BOARD MEMBERS BY NAME SHE'S INTERVIEWED MOST OF THEM ATTENDED ALL THEIR MEETINGS IN PERSON OR WATCH THE LIVE STREAME SHE EVEN WENT TO THEIR OFFSIGHT RETREAT LAST YEAR BEFORE YOU WENT TO ANY MEDICHAEL BOARD MEETINGS HOW DID YOU IMAGINE THEY WOULD BE I THOUGHT THEY'D BE PRETTY BOARING BUT EH AM I THINK I ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE LIKE IN SOME SORT OF GRAND STATE GOVERNMENT BUILDING I THINK I HAD LIKE THE OUR STATE CAPITAL IN MINE OR SOMETHING BUT IT'S JUST LIKE AN OFFICE PARK SO WE YES TE DESCRIBE WHAT IT ACTUA LOOKLIKE IT'S LIKE A YOU KNOW THREE OR FOUR STORY SQUARE OFFICE BUILDING AH YOU KNOW PROBALY BILTS IN THE SEVENTES OR EIGHTIS AM THIS IS NASHVILL SO THERE'S  COPIOUS PARGING ANDAND SOME LIK DUNDER MITHLAN TO ME ALL MA GOT LOOK JUST LIKE UNDERMIPHLEN IT LOOKED JUST LIKE NUNDER MLEN THE FIRST MEETING SHE WENT TO AND OB G WAYAN APPEARED BEFORE THE BOARD TO REQUEST A NEW MEDICAL LICENSE THE BOARD HAD TAKEN HIS OLD LICE IN THE WAY SIX MONTHS BEFORE WHEN THEY LEARNED THAT HE'D HAD SAC WITH ELEVEN OF HIS PATIENCE HE DUNDRUGS WIT AT LEACT ONE OF THEM TO HE'D ALSO PRESCRIBED THEM AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT HIS PATIENCE CONTROLD SUBSENCES LIKE CODENE AND ZANNEX SO THIS DOCTOR WAS THERE TO ASK THE MEDICAL BOARD FOR A NEW LICENCE ALL THAT STUFF THE SAX THE DROGS HAD HAPPENED YEARS BEFORE HED BEEN TO REHAB WA SOBER NOW SAW THE ERROR AND HIS OLD WAYS AND THE BOARD GAVE HIM A NEW LICENSE WITH SOME CONDITIONS ATTACHED BUT HE COULD PRACTICE MEDICINE AGAIN REBECCA COULDN'T BELIEVE IT THET JUST HAS TO BE SOME SINS THAT ARE UNFOR BLE IN THE EYES OF THE BOARD THE BOARD AS OR REGULATORY BODY HE'R NOT OR NOT YOURE PRIEST YOU KNOW THE NOT DECIDING WEATHER NOT YOU'VE REALLY YOURE REALY SORRY THEY'RE DECIDING WHERETHE NOT YOU'RE A SAFE PROVIDER OFFICIALLY THE BOARD'S MISSION IS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH SAFETY AND WELFARE OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF TENNESS E BOARD MEMBERS AND STAFF RPEEP THAT MISSION ALL THE TIME LIKE A MONTRA BUT SINCE REBECCA'S BEEN FOLLOWING THE BOARD SHES SEEN A BUNCH OF CASES LIKE THAT OB G WI AN WEREDOCTORS HAVE DONE SOMETHING REALLY BAD SEEMINGLY IRREDEEMABLE AND SOMEHOW THEY'VE MANAGED TO KEEP THEIR MEDICAL LICENSES THEY'RE OUT THERE WORKING HIS DOCTORS IN TENNESSE RIGHTE NOW SO THIS BECAME THE QUESTION OF HER RESEARCH WHAT WAS GOING WRONG IN THE SYSTEM WHY WERE THESE DOCTORS ALOWED TO KEEP WORK GAE ONE CASE IN PARTICULAR BECAME THE FOCUS OF HER ATTENTIEN BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE A PERFEC STORM OF REGULATORY FAILUR THAT'S WHAT I'M TO TELL YOU ABOUT TO DAY IT'S ABOUT A DOCTOR NAMED MICHAEL LAPAGLIA A'LL START THISTORY BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE PAGLIO WAS WORKING AS AN E AR DOCTOR AT THE TIME AND LATE ONE NIGHT POLICE GOT A CALL ABOUT A DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE AT HIS HOUSE WHEN THE POLICE ARRIVED THEY SMELLED WEED AND SEARCH THE HOUSE THEY FOUND A SHA LET ME JUST READ FROM THE POLICE OFFICERS AFFIDAVIT QUOTE A SEARCH OF THE RESIDENTS PURSUINT TO THE SEARCH WARRENT REVEALED FORTY FIVE CORT SIZE MASIN JARS WHICH CONTAINED MARIWANA HUNGER TWENTY SEVEN GLASS PIPES USED TO SMOKE MARAWANA GLOCK NINETEEN NINE MILLIMETER GROW LIGHT WITH BALLAST TIMER DIGREL SCALE AND LEGER DETAILING NAMES SLASH AMOUNTS A'LSO DIS COVERED WERE APPROXIMATELY FIFTY TWO DIAZA PAM TWENTY TWO EMPHEDAMENE AND TWENTY FOUR OXY CODON PILLS IN ADDITION THEPOLICE FOUND ON A SHELF IN THE PAGLEA'S OFFICE VILS OF SENTINEL MORPEEN AND PROP BEFORE WHICH IS USED FOR GENERAL ANESTHESIA THE PAGLE'S GIRL FREND TOLD POLICE THAT HE HAD THREATENED TO USE THAT STUFF TO KILL HER IN THE PEDITION SHE FILLED FOR A RESTRAINING ORDER THE NEXT DAY SHE SAID QUOT MICHAEL TOLD ME THAT IF I EVER CONTACTED THE POLICE FOR HELP OR REPORTED HIS DRUG US MICHAEL WOULD USE HIS POWERS AS A PHYSICIAN TO HAVE ME COMMITTED TO PSYCHEACTRIC FACILITY MICHAEL STATED HE WOULD MAKE TSURE MY BODY WOULDN'T BE FOUND MICHAEL STATED THAT HE WOULD TAKE MY LIFE AWAY I'M IN FEAR FOR MY LIFE AND MY SON'S LIFE LAPAGLEA TOLD POLICE AS GROL FRIOND WAS DILUSIONAL HE WAS ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH TWO DRUG FELONIES INTEND TO DISTRIBUTE A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE AND INTEND TO DISTRIBUTE MARIWANA HE PLED NO CONTEST AND WENT TO IMPATIENT R HAB HE WAS ADDICTED TO VALIUM AT THE TIME HE LOST IS JOP AT THE HOSPITAL THE MEDICAL BOARD PUT HIM ON PROBATION AND HE SURRENDERED HIS D E A REGISTRATION NUMBER WHICH IS THE THING YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO PRESCRIBE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES THAT'S A BIG DEAL IT'S VERY HARD TO GET A JOB ONCE YOU'VE LOST YOUR D E A NUMBER NO IN WANTS A TOUCH EM NONT PRO NO EMPLOYERS CAN TAKE HIM VERY FEW EMPLOYERS ANYWAY WITH A RECORD LIKE THAT PRIVET INSURANCE FORGET IT HOSPITAL FORGET IT A'M A FEW YEARS LATER HE FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY AH BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S NO WAY TO EARN MONEY BACK AT THE SAME CLIP AS YOU ARE AS YOR PHYSICION BUT HE GOT A JOB I DIDN'T ADDICTION CLINIC A FRIEND OF HIS OWN IT WAS CALLED E H C EXPRESS HEALTH CARE LPAGLE WOULD SEE PATIENCE LIKE A REGULAR DOCTOR WORK UP A TREATMENT PLAN IN EVERYTHING AND THEN ANOTHER DOCTOR WOULD WRITE THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS DOCTOR LAPAGLEA HELPED A FRIEND OF HIS DOCTOR CHARLES BROOKS GET A JOB AT EXPRESS HEALTH CARE TOO DOCTOR BROOKS WAS ALSO ON PROBATION WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD HE'D HAD SEX WITH A PATIENT HE SAYS THEY WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR AND AT LEAST ONCE GIVEN HER A CONTROLLED SUBSTANSE HE SAYS TO CALM HER NERVES BECAUSE THEY WERE AVING AN AFFAIR BUT UNLIKE DOCTOR LAPAGLIA HE DID NOT LOSE HIS D E A NUMBER HE COULD STILL PRESCRIBE DOCTOR LAPAGLEA LEFT E EIGH C AND IN EARLY TWENTY EIGHTEEN HE AND DOCTOR BROOKS STARTED UP A LITTLE SIDE BUSINESS SO HE AND DOCTOR BROOKS KIND OF HATCH THIS PLAN LPAGLE ON BROOKS REALIZE A C WILL WHER'S A DO WORGAN A SORT O CLINIC CALL ELLEN B HEALH CARE LAPAGLIA AN BROOKS LUT LAPAGLE DOESN'T HAVE T A NUMBER SO WILL USE BROOKS'S LAPAGLEAS CAN DO THE WORK HE'S GON  WRITE THE PRESRIPTIONS I'S HIS FOE NUMBER ON THE PRESCRIPTION PAD THAT THEY MAKE OUT BUT ITS BROOKS IS D EA NUMBER AND IT'S BROOKS IS SIGNATURE SOMETIMES THEY WERE PRESINES SOMETIMES LAPAGLE AFORGED THE SIGNATRE ON THEY SELLOM FOR THREE HUNDREDOLLARS CASH OTO LAPAGLEAS HOME AT LEAST ONCE IN UNDR DOLLARS PARKUNAT ELLEN B HEALTH CARE DIDN'T HAVE AN ACTUAL BRICK AN MORTER OFFICE LAPAGLE WOULD SEE PEOPLE WHEREVER IT WAS CONVENIENT WRITE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES LIKE CLONIPAN VALLIUM IN SUBOXEN LHEN TEPAX GAME OUT ABOUT THEIR OPERATION IT LOOK LIKE THEY WERE SELLING PRESCRIPTIONS FOR CASH LIKE DRUG DEALERS WITH STETHIS COS LAPAGLEAN BROOKS SAY THAT'S NOT THE CASE AT ALL THAT THEY WERE LEGITIMATELY TREATING PEOPLE WITH A DICTION PROBLEMS BYKE PRESCRIBING THEM CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES THEY SOMETHING CALLED MEDICATION AS SIS TED TREATMENT BIK THE WAY METHODONE IS USED TO TREAT HEROINE ADDICTIONS SO THAT'SWHAT THEY SAID THEY WERE DOING REGARDLESS IT WAS STILL A LEGAL THE FEW MONTHS INTO THE VENTURE THE FEDS BOSTED THEM CHARGE THEM WITH DRUG TRAFFICINE FOR WRITING PRESCRIPTIONS FOR CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES WITHOUT THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO AND FRAUD FOR USING BOOKS HIS D E A NUMBER IN THE SCAM BROOKS PLAD NOT KILTY BUT DOCTOR LAPAGLE AS SIGNED PLLY DEAL WITH FEDERAL PROSECUTORS HE STILL WAITING TO BE SENTENCE BUT HE COULD BE FACING PRISON TIME SO THAT'S THE FEDERAL CRIMINAL COURT LAPAGLEA STILL HAD TO FACE THE TENNESSY MEDICAL BOARD AND WHEN THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT ELLEN B HEALTH CR THEY SE MARGLE SUSPENDED THE DOCTOR'S MEDICAL LICENCES ANDTILL THEY COULD HOLD DISCIPLINARY HERINGS FOR THEM THE CASE UNFOLDED OVER THREE HEARINGS FOR MARCH TO JULY TWENTY NINETEEN THE FIRST ONE IN MARCH WAS THE DISCIPLINARY HEARING FOR LAPAGLE AS PARTNER DOCTOR BROOKS REBECCO WAS THERE SHE BEEN GOING TO MEDICAL BOARD MEETINGS FOR YEAR AT THAT POINT AND I SEE THIS GUY WHO AM IS DO IT SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY EVEN I THINK THE PHYSICIANS ON THE BOARD FIND REALLY OFFENSIVE WHICH IS GIVING UP CONTROL OF YOUR YOUR PAD AND TO HAND IT OVER TE SOMEBODY ELSE IS REALLY SEEN AS PRE ON AONETHICAL AM MOST DOCTORS DON'T VIEW THEIR PAD AS AS A MONEYMAKER THESE MEDICAL BOARD DISCIPLINARY HEARINGS ARE TECHNICALLY ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS THEY RUN KIND OF LIKE THE CRIMINAL AND CIVIL COURT SYSTEMS BUT THE QUESTION THEIRE ADDRESSING IS MORE POINTED IT'S WHETHER A DOCTOR SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO PRACTIS MEDICEN DOCTOR LAPAGLIA AGREED TO TESTIFY AGAINST DOCTOR BROOKES IN FRONT OF THE MEDICAL BOART DE TIN TUR ON THAT YDOR I A TROUBER RA OR THAT YOUR HENOU THE AS MEMER AS JUST TA SET A STANEY THE GUY ASKING THE QUESTIONS IS ANDREW COFFMAT HE'S THE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY HE WORKS FOR THE TENNESSEE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH DOCTOR LAPAGLIA IS THE ONE ANSWERING HIS QUESTIONCE WHY YOU ERE PARTNER WER DOCTOR BROG DO YOUARE NOT WAS HE A WAR THAT YOU WERE SIDIN HIS MAN WITE  YES WHAT MI YU THINK THAT HE WAS WORE BECAUSE SOME TIMES IN WT RUN ON WE TIM OCRITIONS AND HAS TO YOU WE HASTOCU TAK OR  ATION AND WE DISCUSS IT WHEN YOU WENT TE WORK ER WEG DOCTOR BRUG DID YOU BELIEV TAH WHAT YOU WERE DOING WAS AGAIN THE WALL NO DOCTOR LEPAGLEY WAS LIKE YEH I THINK WE PLY COT SOME CORNERS I THINK YOU KNOW MISTAKES WERE MADE AN WE DISCUSS IT IN WE KNEW THAT WHAT WE WERE DOING WAS IN THE IDEAL O BECAUSE WE HAD VERI A RESOURCES HE CUL STARTED BET WE NEVER IMAGINED THAT WE WERE BREAKING THE LON HIS GENERAL ATTITUDE WAS LIKE YR AIR IN DUDGMEN YOU KNOW NADBEGIL HAS YOUR OPINEN CHANGE ABOUT WHETHER YOU WERE BRINGING MORE YES WHA BECAUSE TEL PROSECURE HAV CON MIS ME EERWAS I SPOKE WITH DOCTOR LAPAGLIA HE DIDN'T WANT ME TO RECORT OUR CONVERSATION AND WE DIDN'T TALK FOR LONG BEFORE HE GOT OFF THE PHONE BUT HE REITERATED TO ME THAT HE AND DOCTOR BROOKES DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE DOING ANYTHING WRONG WHEN THEY WORKED IN THE DICTION CLINEX THE DOCTORS THERE WOULD HAND PRESCRIPTIONS TO RECEPTIONISTS AND THE RECEPTIONISTS WOULD CALL THEM INTO A FARMERSY IT HAPPENED ALL THE TME HE TOLD ME QUOT WE DID NOT SEE ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM GIVING ME VERBAL AUTHORIZATION TO CALL THEM IN AND VERBAL AUTHORIZATION TO WRITE THE PRESCRIPTION THEY STILL DON'T SEE A DIFFERENCE AND IF SOMEONE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT THEY COULD HAVE JUST TOLD US TO STOP THEY DIDN'T HAVE TOR IN DITUS AND CHARGE US WITH TWO FELONIES I REACHED OUT TO DOCTOR LAPAGLIA SEVERAL TIMES AFTER THAT INITIAL CALL BUT HE DECLINED MY REQUEST TO TALK FURTHER THEY WERE THREE BOARD MEMBERS HEARING DOCTOR BROOKS'S CASE THAT DAY AND THEY WERE NOT SUAYED BY THIS DEFENCE THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE DOING ANYTHING WRONG THAT THEY WERE JUST TRYING TO HELP THEIR DRUG SICK PATIENCE IN FACT THE BOARD MEMBERS SUSPECT TED THAT ELEN BE HELFGARE WAS NOT A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS AT ALL HERE'S DOCTOR CHARLES HAND DORF ONE OF THE BOARD MEMBERS QUESTIONING DOCTOR LAPAGLIA ID DE CLENET ER WER A PLY FOR O RECEIVE A BUSIMESS LIKE NDID DE CLENET ERWER A PLA FOR OR AREAT ES TURE AND ORTICLES MEN CORPORATION WITH THE SECRETARY STATE NTE ENCY HAS THE CLENET ERE FOLL CATTRETER I TATS O DA TOW  SO AN TIIN YERE AL LIKE THIS IS IN THE BUSINESS AT ALL SO THAT WAS DOCTOR LAPAGLIA TESTIFYING AT DOCTOR BROOKS'S DISCIPLINARY HEARING IN FRONT OF THE MEDICAL BOARD ONCE BROOKS'S CASE WAS ADJUDICATED IT WAS LAPAGLE'S TURND FOR DISCIPLINE HE AND HIS ATTORNEY HAD WORKED OUT TO DEAL WITH ANDREW COFFMEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HELSITANY IT'S CALLED T A CONSENT ORDER IT'S PASICALY THE BOARD'S VERSION OF A PLEA DEAL IT SO AD THE NEXT BOARD MEEDAN IN MAY COFFMAN PRESENTED THIS DEAL TO THE BOARD MEMENS THE BOARD HAD TO DECIDE WETHER TO ACCEPTEN THE MORIN ATER COFFIN WITH OLF HI SUF GENERAL CACOL AND HERE'S WITH TA DEAL WAS HESICALLY LAPAGLIA COULD GO BACK TO PRACTICING MEDICINE IN ANOTHER MONT BUT HE'D BE ON PROBATION FOR FIVE YEARS AND HE'D HAVE TO BE MONITER BY A PHYSICIANCE OF DICTION GRIM AND HE'D BE BAND FROM PRESCRIBING CONTOLD SSUBSANCENS  FOR TWO YEARS IT' SIMILAR TO WHAT DOCTOR BROOKSCOTTON MARCE BUT SLIGHTLY LESS THECAUSE LAPAGLIA HEADADMITTED GEALS AND HAD TESTIFIED AGAINST PRITS IT'S WHAT THEY CALL IT DOWN NOA DEPARTURE IN T FROMHINAL SYSEM COOPERATING WITNESSIS OFTEN GET LITER SENENCSES IT'S SUPPOSED TO GIVE PEOPLE IN IN SENTIVE TO TELL THE TRUTHS BUT THE BOARD WAS NOT HAVING IT WITH THE STEEL THEY LOOKED AT LAPAGLA AND SAW GUY WHOSE MEDICAL LICENSE WAS ALREADY ON PRIBATION WHEN HE USED ANOTHER DOCTOR'S PRESCRIPTION PAD TO WRITE CONTROLED  SUBSANCE DESCRIPTIONS HERE'S DOCTOR DOHN HAL ONE OF THE BOARD MEMBERS R THE THIS SAME SHRARO I  AIN WE IST HAL A I EO ES PRESCRIPTION SUR STAOR IN HI HAN WOR SHUD BEE GINLY BOARD E TAR II I CAN'T BE GOOD CONTRAGE I A A PROMI SONSURE THE BOARD

LICONS FOR EVEN LONGER FOR INCENS WERE EVEN REVOKE IT ALTOGETHER I HAD TEE FOLLOWING THIS CASE AND SO Y I WANTED A FULL HEARING I WANTO THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE DOCTOR LAPAGOR TUSTIFY AND T FOR A TAL TOON AN I FIGURED EVERYTHING WAS LINING OUT FOR THEM TO FINALLY THROW THE BOOK AT SOMEBODY REBECCA HAD BEEN TO SEVERAL OF THESE DISCIPLINARY HEARINGS BY THAT SHE'D SEEN SO MANY DOCTORS GET AWAY WITH WHICH HE CONSIDERED TO BE LIGHT PUNISHMENTS BUT IT SEEM LIKE THE BOARD WAS FINALLY GIN TO PUT ITS FOOT DOWN WITH LAPAGLIA N  THIN TO CTO US COMMING OUT WHAT GOES WRONG WHEN THE BOY GETS A CHANCE O FUN Y PUT ITS FOOT DOWN THAT'S A MINUTE THE JICAGA PUBLA GREDEA WHEN OUR PROGRAMM CONTINUES TS TIS S MARE CAN LI FROM YR GLASS TO DAYS PROGRAMM TRUST ME O'M A DOCTOR W STORYS ABOUT PEOPLE TRING TO DO SIVIC MINDED THINGS FOR THE R OWN COMMUNITIES AND IN THE CASE OF MEDICAL BOARDS SOMETIMES FAILING TO A COPISH THAT JOB THE WAY THE LOTS OF US WUL WANT THEM TO WHEN KNOW WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ACHIVIS'S STORY AND WE PICK UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF THE MEDICAL BOARD IN TENDESSE HAS REJECTED DAFTOR LAPAGLE'S QUE DEAL AND TOO MUCH AFTER THAT AT THE NEXT MEETING THE BOARD HOLDS A HEARING FOR HIS CASE HE SAID HOW THE'S HERING'S WORK THERE BESICALLY MANY TRIALS EACH CASE GETS ASSIGNED TO A PANEL OF THREE BOARD MEMBERS LA PAGLE'S PANEL WAS MADE UP OF TWO DOCTORS AND A CONSUMER MEMBER THE SIT AT THE FRONT OF THE ROOM FACING EVERYONE ELSE AND THERGAN A DECIDE IF THE PROSECUTOR HAS PROVE IN HIS CASE AND IF SO HOW TO DISCIPLINE DOCTOR LAPAGLIAER THEYS ALSO AN ADMINISTRATIVE LODGEDGE WHO ACTS AS A REFERY MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE TO THAN E WARD WILL BE CON SITER IN THE CASE A JUS I PON A HELL MIRSE IS MICHAEL LAPAGLIA THEY HOLD DOCTOR LAPAGLE IS HEARING IN THE IRIS ROM A N WHICH DEFIES THE INTERIOR DECORATOR'S VISION AGE CARPET AGE WALLS I FARSONT LIGHTS AN DOCTOR LAPAGLIA IS SITTING AT HI S TABLE WITH HIS ATTORNEY FACING THE PANEL THE PROSECUTOR ANDREW COFFMAN HE SITTING AT A TABLE TO THE RAGI REBECCA'S THERE TOO IN THE FRONT RO HERE WAS REALLY WEIRD IT WAS WEARD FROM THE FIRST I HE MOMENT WHEN THEY DID OPENING STATEMENTS THE MORNING I MAY COMAN YOU FOR MAYNT TES MYSELF EARLIER THE PROSECUTOR WENT FIRST MISTER COFFMAN AND HE SAID WER  LOT BAT TAT GOOD BATAN AGLY YOU KNOW THIS IS A RARE CAS WO REBASICALLY AGREE WITH TEFENCE COUNSEL ON EVERYTHIR AND IN AN UNUSUAL TUER E NOT MUCH DES POU WHEN THE PARTIS ABOUT WHAT THERS BAT OR WHETHER THEYR GOD BYAT WOR AT WAS JUST KIND OF A HALF HARTED PROSECUTION I MEAN NOT PASON AD MINSTER A FURIOUS LITTLE MORE CASURAL THANA CRIMINEL CHARLESON IT WAS MEANT TO BE OVERSERIAL NOW I TINK THA WE AV OS GIN A SHO THE DACTRA PALIA BELIEVVE THAT HE WAS PROBIDING GOD TREATMEN HEPLL BAT ACLE HAV ME LETR COFFMAN IS THERE TO PROSECUTE LAPAGLA BUT IT SEEMS LIKE HE'S GOING PRETTY EASY ON HIM LIKE THAT TWENTY THIRTEEN DRUG BUST THE ONE WETE TH COPS FOUND VALIAN OXY CODON AND FEDAMEANS MARAWANA A GAN A SCALE O LAGER PARALITIC AGENTS AND OTHER SENTITIVES COFFMAN DOESN'T SAY THE CHARGE WAS POSSESSION WITH INTEND TO DELIVER HE JUST SAYS LAPAGLEAR PLED TO SOME CHARGES THAT R WITE THAT IS OWN PERSONAL USE O CONTROL FO HOL AN THE MA O THE WAW AN THE VER NEXT MONG IF I WERE PROSECUTING WERE I WOULD PROBABLY US SOME STRONGER LANGUAGE LAPAGLE IS COMING ACROSS AS A GUY WHO ONCE STRUGGLE IS THE SUBSTANCE USED DISORDER UT GOD HELP SOBERED OUTAND THEN IN THE COURSE OF TRYING TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM DOGADICTIONS UNWITTINGLY BUMBLED HIS WAY INTO THIS NEXT BIT OF TROUBLE WITH DOCTOR BROKS HE TELL LAPAGLE IS DEFENCE ATTERNEY ALSO DESCRIBED HIM IN HIS ERVENING STATEMENT HE MAY BE DON BUT HE'S A GOOD DON HE'S EREAS P HE'S RESPON HE'S DONE ALINE TO HELP THE COMEAN I'S LIKE EVERY ONE IN THIS TRIAL WAS ON DOCTOR LAPAGLI'S SIDE I ASKED ANDREW COFFMAN WHY HE HANDLED THE CASE THE WAY HE DID HE SAID BASICALLY THIS CASE WASN'T CONTENTIOUS BY ITS VERY NATURE HIS JOB WAS TO PROVE THE DOCTOR LAPAGLIA HAD WRITTEN PRESCRIPTIONS FOR CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES USING ANOTHER DOCTOR'S PRESCRIPTION PAT HIS STAR WITNESS DOCTOR PAGLIA WHO HAD ADMITTED REPEATEDLY THAT YES HE HAD USED DOCTOR BROOKS'S PAD TO WRITE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES BUT ALSO THERE'S ANOTHER REASON WHY THE PROSECUTION WAS MAYBE A BIT ANEMIC IN THIS CASE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ATTORNEYS COFFMAN AND HIS COLLEAGUES WERE FEELING FRESTRATED WHEN THIS WHOLE THING STARTED BACK IN MARCH AND DOCTOR BROKS'S HEARING DOCTOR BROOKS LAPAGLEY'S COCONSPIRATOR COFFMAN HAD ASKED THE BOARD TO REVOKE DOCTOR BOKS'S LICENSE BUT THE BOARD REJECTED THAT A SAID IT WAS TOO HARSH SO THE PROSECUTORS WENT EASIER ON LAPAGLIA IN HIS PLEADIA AND THEN THE BOARD REJECTED THAT SAID IT WENT TOO EASY ON HI THERE WAS NO CONSISTENCY TO THEIR LODGEC COFFMAN'S PAW SAID LATER AT A BOARD RETREAT WHERE THEY DISCUSS THIS CASE THAT THEY FELT A LITTLE BIT KNOCKE DOWN BY THE WHOLE THING SO AT LAPAGLE IS HEARING COFFMAN JUST PRESENTED THE STRAIGHT FACTS IN THE CASE AND TOLD THE PANEL WHAT THEIR OCTIONS WORE FOR DISCIPLINING HIM DIDN'T SUGGEST A PUNISHMENT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELTHABOARD WANTED SO THEY DIDN'T TRY TO GUESS AND THIS BRINGS US TO THE SINGLE BATIS PROBLEM REBECCA SEAS IN THE SYSTEM THE DOCTORS WHO SIT ON THESE MEDICAL BOARDS TIT'S A DISTINGUISHED POSITION TO BE ON THE TENNESSA BOARD O MEDICAL EXAMINERS THEY HAVE TO BE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR THERE'S A FULLTIME STAFF THAT SUPPORTS THE BOARD ATTORNEYS ADMINISTRATORS MEDICAL CONSULTANCE AND THEY SIT IN JEDGMENT OF DOCTORS BUT AS FAR AS JEDGES GO THEIRE AMATEURS MOST OF THEM WERE DOCTORS THEY HAVE LOTS

IT'S NEVER CAN HAPPEN SO WHAT WOULD AT THE GOING YOU RELAPSE WHEN I ESEN I COULD SEE DOCTOR LOYD NODDING ALONG LIKE WIN DOCTOR LE PAGWAY WAS TALKING ABOUT LIKE THE PROBLEM OF DUEL ADICTION BETWEEN

HE'S TESTIN LAPAGLA TRYING TO SEE IF HE REALLY UNDERSTANDS A DICTION MEDICINE A CAN YOU TON ME HAD YOU ESTABLISH A BABNESS IS AF SUCITUSE DISORDER SO BE I TRO DISCUSSION I TAING ATRI HISTORY AM GY

DELIBERATIONS DOCTOR LOYD SPEAKS FIRST AN THE JUST MEMBER THIS COMMITTEER TISPOARD AN A SOLD HATA MY CHARGE ES T PROTECT THE HELL SAFETY AND WELFARE  SINCSINCE TA STATE TENY AND AND DO I BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT  TAKING DOCTOR OPAGLYAS LI SINCE A THA'S THATER I SHWE DON I DON'T BELIEVE THE ATIT I TE PIN E BES THAT AM FROM WHAT I SAW TO DAY IN IN A NO PO PLAM THAT THAT THESE SUGGESTIVE A SOM MUDY'S HART AND A SELSOF MIDHY THE CARSE AM ABAT TAKING TOUD CARE FOR POPULATION THE TRUGGLES TO FIND HELP THATS WHAT US ALF ONE ASPECT OF THESE MEDICAL BOARD HEARINGS THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM A CRIMINAL TRIAL E HE CAUSE OF TRANSPARENCY LAWS AND TENESSEE THE PANEL MEMBERS HAFE TO DELIBERATE IN THE OPEN IN FRONT OF DOCTOR LAPAGLA REBECCA SAYS THIS IS ANOTHER REASON THE DISCIPLINE CAN BE SO LIL IT'S REALLY AWKWARD FELLO LOOK T RAISES SOME PATENTIAL ISSUEIS  BUK GAT ONE POINT WHILE THE PANEL MEMBERS ARE CONSIDERING REQUIRING DOCTOR LAPAGLIA TO GET BOARD CERTIFIED IN ADDICTION MEDICINE LE PAGLY AT INTORROTIS LUP  ISTERE'S THEM AWAY FROM IT DO WE WANT TO REQUIRE HIM TO A MAN OR AND IF HE GANSIN COMPLY I REA ACTENLY ASK NOW BECAUSE I MAY CHANGE MY MIND OR SOMETHING ELSE MAY HAPPEN AND I DON'T FOR FILL THAT REQUIREMENT I NEVER GMINDS YOU GEV OCCLAMATION THE ADMINISTERTO JEDGE HASTABERATE GAN AND TELL THEM TO QUIT TALKING TO EACH OTHER SOTESER IN THE END HERE'S WITH THE PANEL DECIDES FORY THEY'RE GOING TO RESTORE DOCTOR LAPAGLE AS MEDICAL LICENS WHICH HAD BEEN SAMARELY SUSPENDED IN JANUARY WHEN THE BOARD FIRST FOUND OUT ABOUT THE ELENBISKI AS PUNISHMENT THEY GIVE HIM FIVE YEARS PROBATION MAK HIM REPORT TO THE TENNESS E MEDICAL FOUNDATION IT'S A PHYSICIANS SUBSTANSE O BESCROUP AND THEY TELL HIM TO TAKE A FEW PROFESSIONAL COURSES THEY DON'T PROHIBIT HIM FROM PRESCRIBING CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES HE STILL DOESN'T HAVE A D  A NUMBER SO TECHNICALLY HE CAN'T ANYUWAY BUT HE COULD PE TITION THE D  A TO GET IT BACK THEY DON'T RESTRICT BAT EITHER IT'S ACTUALLY A LIGHTER DISCIPLINE THAN WHAT HE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN FROM THE PLEAAGREE THEN THE ONE THE BOARD THROUGH OUT FOR BEING TOO EASY ON HIM SO YA IT WAS A SLOP ON THE RIST DOCTOR LE PAGLEER WAS ALL SMILES AFTERWARDS SO I HAD CHATTER WITH HIM AT THE BRAKES AND AM HE WAS SORT OF SAYING YOU KNOW IM I'M JUST HOPIN AGAIN ET MY LICENSE BACK ANNOT YOU KNOW AND IOT THE FEDERAL THING I GOT A DEAL WITH AND SO FOR SOME REASON THEY DECIDED TO INSERT THIS LANGUAGE OF THE END THAT SAYS  YOU KNOW TO GIVE HIM A FULL A A PATHBACK TO FULL LICENSURE AND WHEN THEY READ THAT OUT LOUD DOCTOR LEPAGLY A WINKED TO ME OH WHICH REALLY SURPRISED ME IT JUST REALY SURPRISED ME II'D  I WAS LIKE TO THAT JUST HAPPEN W HAS YOU INTERPRET HIS WINK I THINK THIT HE WAS SORT OF SAING LIKE SEE I'M GETTING WHAT I WANTED I GUESS I THINK I WENT EVEN BETTER THAN HE EXPECTED MT THING THAT MIGHT BE WHY HE WINK TO ME SO I WENT OFTORHIM AFTERWARDS A TALK TO HIM AND BY THE TIME I HAD SHOT WITH HIM A COUPLE TIMES AND HHE SAYS SOMETHING LIKE I'M JUST GLAD TO HAVE MY LIFE INS OFF OF SUSPENSION SO I CAN MAKE SOME MONEY IT WAS A REAL KIND OF WONEATY FROM THE LIKE PATIENT CARE JUST TESTIMONY THAT HE HAD JUST PROMOTED I REACHD OUT TO DOCTOR LAPAGLE ABOUT THIS BUT HE DIDN'T GET BOCK TO ME SO HERE YOU'VE GOT A DOCTOR WHO LOST HIS D  A NUMBER WHEN HE WAS CAUGHT WITH A LEGAL PRES CRIPTION DRUGS AND MARIWANA AT HIS HOUSE AND WHAT LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE A DRUG TRAFFICING OPERATIEN HE'S MEDICAL LICENSE WAS PUT ON PROBATION WHE THEN WENT OUT AND BROKE THE LAW AGAIN BYT USING ANOTHER DOCTORS D E A NUMBER TO PRESCRIBE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND NOW HERE HE IS BACK ON PROBATION WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD STILL WITH THE MEDICAL LICENSE WHICH MEANS HE CAN STILL WORK AS A DOCTOR IN THE YEARS THAT CHE'S BEEN GOING TO MEDICAL BOARD MEETINGS REBECTOR HAS WATCHED A BUNCH OF DOCTORS WITH A GREGIOUS HISTORIES KEEP PRACTICING MEDICIN DOCTORS WHO HAVE COMMITTED HEALTH CARE FRAUD DOCTORS WHO PRESCRIBED CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN'T THEIR PATIENTS DOCTORS WHO HAVE SEC WITH PATIENTS ONE DOCTOR PRESCRIBED LARGE DOSES OF O BIOIDS AND OTHER DRUGS EVEN THOUGH THE PATIENTS HAD NO MEDICAL REASON FOR TAKING THEM PROSECUTORS ASKED THE BOARD TO PERMANENTLY REVOKE HIS LICENSE BUT HE WAS ONLY PUT ON PROBATION AS FAR AS I CAN TELL TENNESSS FAIRLY TYPICAL AS STATISTICAL STUDY RANK MEDICAL BOARDS ON A SCALE OF HOW HARSH TO LIGHT THEIR DISCIPLINE WAS TENNESSE WAS SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF COURSE AN TALKING ABOUT THE WOARST CASES THE MEDICAL BOARD SES AND THE BOARD DOES REVOKE SOME DOCTOR'S LICENCES SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THEY'VE TECAN THIRTEEN LICENSEES AWAY AND THE LEVEN DOCTORS HAVE VOLUNTARILY SURRENDERED THEM HAT'S A SIGNIFICANT PUNISHMENT AS ONE BOARD MEMBER EXPLAIN TO ME A MEDICAL LICENSE IS TECHNIDALLY A PROPERTY WAY AND IT'S A BIG DEAL THAT TAKE SOME ONS PROPERTY FROM THEM BUT' SOMETHING DOES SEEM TO BE HAPPENING WHERE MEDICAL BOARDS WHICH ARE SET UP TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC TO PROTECT THE MAJORITY OF US WHO NEVER THINK TO ASK WHETHER OUR DOCTORS ARE SAFE AND OPERATING IN OUR BEST INTERESTS SOMETIMES THE MEDICAL BOARDS ARE LETTING DANGEROUS DOCTORS CONTINUE TO PRACTISE MEDICIN LIKE ON THE ONE HAND I I FEEL LIKE ON SOME LAVEL I UNDERSTAND THIS PROBLEM CAUSE I SPENT SO L NGSTUDYING IT I'VE SEEN ALL THE ANGLES I'VE SEEN HOW THE PERSONALITYES PLAY OUT IN THE INSENTIVES IN THE EMOTIONS IN EVERYTHING BUT THERE'S ALSO A WAY WHICH I JUST DON'T GET IT LIKE I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHE THEY WON'T JUST TAKE THE GUISES LICENSE WHAT'S THE PRART OF VIEU THAT UNDERSTANDS IT I THINK THAT THERE'S A I DENTIFICATION THAT'S NOT AS SPECIFIC AS OH THAT COULD BE ME THAT'S STILL IN PLAY OF JUST BEING A DOCTOR LIKE THIS IS AR CALLING WE WENT TO SIMILAR E HOUG SIMILAR SUT'S A TRAININGS WE STARTED OUT WALKING DOWN THE SAME PATH SO THINK THERE IS SOME LIKE I DNTIFICATION AT A KIND OF VERY HIGH PROFESSIONAL LEVEL LIK AT' STARCLING THE WAGONS YOU KNOW LIKE WE'RE DOCTORS AND THEN I THINK THERE'S ALSO AND D THE SPROY ASPECIALY BOT FOR DOCTORS BUT HERE JUST CON OF SOFTIES THERE JUST E YNO'VE THAT EVERYBODY CCAN BE HEALED AND CAN BE MADE BETTER AND AR SICK AND DESERVING OF COMPASSION I MAY NOT'S LIKE WHAT'S LET THIS REALY IRONIC AN MAX SAD TO ME IS IT IS IN SOME WAYS THIS WHOLE PROBLEMCS CREATED BY THAT LIKE BETTER PART OF HUMAN NATURE O THE PART THATS FULL OF MERCY REBEC A SOLUTION TO THIS WHOLE THING WELL I THINK WE NUN TO ABOLISH LICENSING WORDS TO BE PERFECATLLY ONEST INSTEAD OF HAVING DOCTORS SIT IN JUDGMENT OF OTHER DOCTORS AND INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM DO THIS AS A FAVOURED TO SOCIETY EVERY FEW MONTHS REBECCA SAYS HAVE FULL TIME EM PLOLESE WHOS JOB IT IS TO REGULATE THE INDUSTRY WHO ARE TRAINED TO NOTICE WHEN THE'RE BEING AFFECTED BY THE EMOTIONAL SWAY OF THE DEFENDA AND BUT THEIR FEELINGS ACIDE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE LIKE A JEDGE WOOD TECTOR LOID AGREES WITH REBECCA IN PART HE ADMITS HE DID RELIED TO LAPAGLIA AND IT INFLUENCED HOW HE THOUGHT ABOUT DISCIPLINE OT TOW THE FACT AN THE DA ME DOWN ON THE TE BIT I TIT N NOT DAN YE HAS DO E DOT NOW THE MOT OM AN I GE TO ME TAT BE BATE WITHOT ANY BODY FO ME I THAT I AND NOT TIS REE THAT I EBOUT E LA JUST BASED ON THE HE USED ANOTHER DOCTORS D I LICENT SUMBER TO PRESCRIBED PATIENCE YE JUS JUST BA DON'T BLAT BAT A DOT GEORGEI YOU'S ANO TE DOCTOR'S BE AYLIDE IN AA A YOU KNO JOT BEALING I JE JUAT THE ING BAK NO NO TE GEV THE DURNIN NO PROTECUTOR I JUS O THAT RE DOWN ON THE BE BA THE NOW TE BAG LAN A ROOM O REMOUTE LAT IT'S SO INTERESTING AND IT MAN IT I TE WELL IT NOT CANOT GAIN IN THE PRECIATON PL AND IN NOT THINK ENNO I I'M REALLY TRYING TO WORK ON THAT AT THE BOARD MEMBER IT IS VERY DIFFICULT I GET THERE WITH A NOT ER HUMIN BEING IN FRUN OT YOU AND OT YE NO WHEN I WANT O THAT DO THE HAMMER A YE A IT THE HUMAN BEIN RIGT IT MUCH EASIER ON A SHEET O PAPER

WANT A GIV HIM A CAN TO GET THAT BAT YE UT I BUT IT'S NOT FAIR TO SAY THAT'S THE WHULL REASON THE CASE WON ESGEW THE DOCTORS LOOK TOO KINDLY ON A FELLOW DOCTOR SITTING BEFORE THEM BECAUSE WHEN CONSIDERING WHAT TO DO WITH LAAGLY IS MEDICAL LICENSE AND WHETHER HE SHOULD BE A PRACTICING DOCTOR THE BOARD MEMBERS NEVER GOT A FULL ERRING OF HIS PAST MISDEEDS AS SOON AS THE HEARING WAS OVER DOCTOR LAPAGLIA DID SOMETHING THAT MADE DOCTOR LOYDS SUSPICIOUS I DID OP IND AND THAT AN NO WE CAN'TED OUT IN HE APPROACHME N I CAN'T REMEMBER YO BE TACT WORD TAT WIT BEARY LI CAT I MUS MI AN IT PREGAN WHAT

ORDER AGAINST LEPAGLIA AT THE TRIAL THE'S NOT A CRIMINAL CHARGE AND BESIDES HE SAID WILE IT CLEARGLE DEMONSTRATES BAG CONDAT IT ISN'T BD CONDUCT RELATED TO THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE LUT THAT'S NOT ALL HE LEFT DOUT IN TWHEN HE TEN WHILE WORKING HIS N EW YARD DOCTER LEAGLIA DID SOMETHING THAT A FEDERAL LOOPEAL'S COURT SED QUOTE SHOCKS THE CONCIENCE LHE POLICE PROT A YOUNG MAN NEAMED HEELIT'S BOOKER

HANDCUFFS AND LEG CHACKLES HE SAID NO LEPAGLIA SAYS BOOKER CONSENT TO TO THE EXAMI BUT NOBODY ELSE WHO WAS IN THE ROOM HEARD THIS AND THERE'S NO MEDICAL RECORD OF IT LEPAGLIA TRIED TO EXAMINE HIM LUKER CLENCED HIS MUSCLES SO LAPGLEA HAD HIM SUDATED BLUGER WAS STILL ABLE TO CLEN HIS MUSCLES DOWN SO LEPAGLE HAD HIM MEDICALLY PARALYZED IN DIBATED HIM AND DID THE RECTAL EXAM HE FOUND A ROCK OF CRACK LEPAGLA TESTIFIED TA BOOKER'S TRIAL THAT HE'D DONE RECTAL EXAMINES AND TWO OTHER PEOPLE THE POLICE HAD BROUGHT IN TO HIM THE YEAR AFTOR THAT THERE WAS A FORCE TIME WASTLY GULLY POLLI ALEGED HE

SEARCHES HE DIDN'T EVEN LOSE HIS JOB WITH THE HOSPITAL THE SEARCH IS WERE REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH BU DOCTOR LAPAGLE WAS NOTTISCIPLINE FOR THEM AND IN A CRUEL REGULA TORY IRONY BECAUSE HE WAS NOT T ISCIPLINED THERE'S NO PUBLIC RECORD OF WHY THE BOARD DID NOT DISCIPLINE HIM DOCTOR LOYD ACTALLY FOUND OUT ABOUT THE RECTAL SEARCHES FROM REBECCA THEY HAD COFFEE A FEW WEEKS AFTER DOCTOR

THAT ON BOT  IN O TEIN NEN HE COTE A  O DOCTOR LOYD AND THE OTHER BOARD MEMBERS ON LAPAGLI'S PANEL ALL THEY KNEW S THAT LAPAGLIA HAD BEEN ON PROBATION WITH THE BOARD ONCE BEFORE FOR CHARGES RELATED TO HIS PERSONAL DRUG EUS THAT HE BEEN TREATED FOR PILIDICTION AND HAD STAYED SOBER ALL THESE YEARS AND THAT HE AND DOCTOR BOOKS GOT CAT SELLING PRES CRIPTIONS USING DOCTOR BROOKS'S D YA NUMBER BHICH AUSE A WAY TIDIER STORY THAN THE ONE I JUST TOLD YOU BUT COFFMAN DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THE RECTAL SEARCHES OF DOCTOR LPAGLIEAS HEARING BECAUSE OF THE RULES OF EVIDENCE HE TOLD ME IT WOULDN HAVE BEEN AD MISSIBLE SAME FOR THE DETAILS ABOUT THE TWENTY FOURTEEN DRUG CHARGES WHICH BY THE WAY AFTOR LAPAGLIA PLAD NO CONTEST HE WAS PUT INTO SOMETHING CALLED JUDICIAL DIVERSION IT'S A KIND OF PROBATION AND EVENTUALLY THE CASE WAS DISMISSED BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY COFFMAN SAID THIS WASN'T A HEARING ABOUT EVERYTHING LAPAGLIA HAD EVER DONE JUST THIS ONE CRIME THE FRODULENT PRESCRIPTIONS DOCTOR LOYD DIDN'T LEARN ABOUT THE REST OF IT UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE WHET NO LOOKIN ANY MOTER ME WUT WHAT YOU DON WHAT OBEDO DA GER YOR AT WHAT O O HA DOCTOR GI ON GOOD YOT E BAT GIVEN OL TAT YEH BUT T ID ABOT  A HO TAT HAVI GOT OT THE WE A MODY YE E ANEEI IN A REAL WORLD YE NOOK WE AN E OT ARGME BUT DUD COUD NOT IN THE WOARD YOU  A BETICLA YOU CAN HAR OT E BAREE ARTMEN ER DOCTOR LOYD SAYS HE ASKS A LOT MORE QUESTIONS NOW DURING THESE CASES SO HOW TO KEEP THIS FROM HAPPENING HOWTO MAKE SURE THE BOARD GETS A FULL PICTURE OF A DOCTOR'S CAREER AND PASSED MISDEEDS BUT FORE THEY DECIDE HOW TO DISCIPLINE THEM REBECA POINTS TO US SIMPLE AN PRACTICAL SOLUTION  SEPARATE THE DISCIPLINARY HEARING INTO TWO PARTS HAVE ONE HEARING WHERE THE BOARD HEARS EVIDENCE AND DECIDES OF A DOCTORIS GUILTY OF THE CHARGES AND ANOTHER HEARING WHERE THE DOCTOR IS DISAPIN AND AT THAT POINT THEY CAN LEARN OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT A DEFENDENT'S PAST BOTH GOOD AND THATHAT'S HOW CRIMINAL CUTOR ONCE THE JURY HIS DETERMINED A PERSON'S GUILT THE JUDGE IS THE ONE WHO DOES THE SENTEN SAYING AND GETS TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE DEFENDIT THIS SOLUTION REBECCA POINTS OUT AS THE BENEFIT OF BEING READILY AVAILABLE TO THE BORT IT'S ALREADY EQUAL UNDER TENNESSEY LAW   LAST SEPTEMBER THE MEDICAL BOARD MEMBERS IN STAFF HAD AN OFFSIDE RETREAT REBECCO WAS THERE SHE RECORDED IT FOR HER NOTES FOR HER BOOK UNLICENSIN BOARDS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY DISCUSSED WAS DOCTOR LAPAGLEA'S CASE WHAT HAD GONE WRONG DOCTOR LOYD WAS STILL UPSET ABOUT IT DOCTOR LAPAGLIA IS A PRACTICING DOCTOR IN TENNESSEA RIT NOW HE DOES HOUSE CALLS FOR FIFTY DOLLARS CASH AND LOYD EXPLAIN WHAT HE SEES AS THE REAL PROBLEM WITH THAT KIND OF OUTCOME WITH THIS HALF WAY DESCIPLINE THEY GAVE LAPAGLIA THEY'VE MADE IT SO HE CAN'T GET A JOB AT A HOSPITAL ARE A MEDICAL PLENET BUT HE CANNED STILL SEE PATIONS DOCTOR LOYD SAID QUOTE HE CAN ONLY WORK IN A CASH BASE PRACTISE AND SO THE MOST VULNERABLE PENNESSEANS ARE THE ONES AT RISK AND THAT'S NOT ALSOME BHECAUSE THE VERY POPULATION THAT I WORK PERSONALLY WITH ON A DAILY BASIS I JUST PUT SOMEBODY BACK OUT THERE AND I'M STRUGGLING WITH THAT   THEV TO AS IS ONE OF THE PRUCES TOR OF PROGRAMME REBECCA

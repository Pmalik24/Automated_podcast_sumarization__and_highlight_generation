WELCOME TO THE HUBERMENLAPONTENS  SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TO  FRLIFE I MAY DREHUBERMEN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY MY GUEST IS DOCTOR JEFFREY GOLDBERG DOCTOR JEFFREY GOLBERG IS THE CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE HE IS A CLINITION AND EMDY OR MEDICAL DOCTOR WHO SEES PATIENTS EVERY WEEK AS WELL AS A P HT MEANING ELABORATORY SCIENTIST WHO DIRECTS HIS OWN LABORATORY FOCUSED UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS AND CURES FOR DISEASES OF THE EYE AN VISION SUCH AS GLAUCOMA RETINITIS PIGMANTOSA AND MACULAR DEGENERATION INDEED DOCTOR GOLBERG IS ONE OF THE WORLD LEADERS IN DEVELOPING METHODS TO CURE BLINDNESS HE IS ALSO INTENSELY KNOWLEDGIBLE ABOUT ALL THINGS RELATED TO VISION DURING TO DAY'S DISCUSSION WE INDEED COVER MOST ALL OF VISUAL AND IY HEALTH YOU WILL LEARN FOR INSTANCE ABOUT THE BENEFITS AS WELL AS DRAWBACKS OF WEARING CORRECTIVE LENZES SUCH AS CONTACT LENZES OR EYE GLASSES FOR READING YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT THE BENEFITS AND DETRIMENTS OF SUNLIGHT MEANING HOW IT CAN HELP YOUR VISION IN FACT HOW IT CAN HELP REVERSE OR PREVENT MIOPIA MERE SITEDNESS AS WELL AS THE THINGS TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT WITH RESPECT TO SUNLIGHT IN TERMS OF DEVELOPMENT OF CATARACTS WHICH ARE ECCLUSIONS THAT PREVENT VISION WE ALSO DISCUSS MANY TOOLS FOR MAINTAINING AND IMPROVING VISION ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN RANGING FROM BEHAVIAL TOOLS SO SPECIFIC VISION TASKS AND EXERCISES FOR THE EYE THAT YOU CAN DO THAT ARE KNOWN TO IMPROVE OR MAINTAIN YOUR VISION AS WELL AS SPECIFIC SURGICAL PROCEDURES SUCH AS LACIC SURGERY WE GET INTO ALL THE DETAILS OF FOR INSTANCE HOW OFTEN TO DO THESE VARIOUS EY EXERCISES HOW LONG THE BENEFITS ARE MAINTAINED AS WELL AS AGE RELATED CONSIDERATIONS FOR THINGS LIKE LACIC E SURGERY WE VAN GET INTO HOW TO BEST CLEAN YOUR CONTACT LENZIS WHETHER NOT TO USE DISPOSABLE CONTACT LENSES OR OTHER FORMS OF CONTACT LENSAS WE LSO DISCUSS THINGS LIKE DRY EYE AND THE BEST REMEDIES FOR DRY EYE AND WE TALK ABOUT THE SCIENTIFIC AND CLINICAL DATA AROUND NUTRITIONAL APPROACHES AND SUPPLEMENTATION BASED APPROACHES FOR MAINTAINING AN IMPROVING VISION SO WHETHER NOT YOU SUFFER FROM FLOATERS OR DRY EYE OR YOUARE CONSIDERING CHANGING YOUR EYE PRESCRIPTION OR YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER NOT RELYING ON CORRECTIVE LENSES IS IMPERRING YOUR VISION AND YOU WANT TO ENHANCE YOUR VISION OR IF YOUR SOMEBODY WHO HAS PERFECT VISION TO DAY'S EPISODE IS GOING TO INCLUDE SCIENCE AND PROTOCALS THAT WILL BE HIGHLY RELEVANT TO YOU I SHOULD ALSO ADD THAT IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO SUFFERS FROM OR WHO HAS FAMILY MEMBERS WHO SUFFER FROM DISEASES OF THE EYE THAT CAN IMPACT VISION SUCH AS GLAUCOMA RETNITIS PIGMANTOSA AND MACULAR DEGENERASION WE ALSO DELVE DEEP INTO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE MOST ADVANCE TECHNOLOGIES FOR PREVENTING AN OFSETTING VISION LOST DUE TO THOSE DISEASES AS WELL THANKS TO DOCTORS GOLBERG'S INCREDIBLE KNOWLEDGE HIS CLARITY OF COMMUNICATION AND HIS GENEROSITY WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE BY THE END OF TO DAY'S EPISODE YOU WILL BE ARMED WITH ALL OF THE MODERN INFORMATION YOU NEED IN ORDER TO BEST MAINTAIN AND IMPROVE YOUR EYE AND VISION HEALTH BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S POTCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR NOW SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTIOND PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLITES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLITE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHISITS IN COGNITIVE END PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACK TELECTRELIKE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THATS ONE GRAHM OF SODIUM TWO UNDER MILEIGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HIDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLIGHTS AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING IS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'VE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENTY DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIMA FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT ELEEMENTY DOCOM SLASH HUBERMEN AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR JEFFREY GOLBERG DOCTOR JEFFREY GOLBERG WELCOME THANKS ITS GREAT TO BE HERE YOU AND I GO WAY BACK WE WILL SPARE PEOPLE THE DISCUSSION ABOUT ALL OF THAT BUT I'M REALLY CITED FOR TO DAY'S DISCUSSION BECAUSE I GET A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ABOUT VISION AND I HEALTH AND COURSE IS A NOR SCIENTISTS WHO HAS WORKED ON THE VISUAL SYSTEM I SOMETIMES HAVE ANSWERS ARE PARTIAL ANSWERS BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS AND YET I'M CONFIDENT THAT YOU DO OR THAT IF YOU DON'T YOU CAN DIRECT US TO THE PROPER PLACE TO GET THOSE ANSWERS SO TO KICK THINGS OFF I WON'T ASK YOU WHAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY ASK QUESTIONS WHEN I SOLICITED FOR QUESTIONS IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS EPISODE WHICH IS HOW EARLY SHOULD ONE DO AND I EXAM ON THEIR CHILD AND HOW REGULARLY SHOULD WE ALL BE DOING I EXAMS ALSO IS THE FACT THAT I THINK I CAN SEE NORMALLY CONFIRMATION THAT I CAN SEE AS WELL AS I THINK I CAN SO THAT'S REALLY THREE QUESTIONS BUT BABY COMES OUT DO THEY CHECK THEIR EYES RIGHT AWAY AND AT SO HOW AND HOW OFTEN SHOULD THEY CHECK AND WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION IS THERE YES AS AS A GREAT QUESTION ANT'S OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT TOUCHES US ALL SO THE CR THAT THEY ANSWER THAT REALLY JEFFER IS A LITTLE BIT I AT THE DIFFERENT STAGES LIFE FIRST OF ALL EVERY EVERY BABY GETS AND I EXAMER SHOULD BE GETTING AND I EXAM AND A ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS THAT YOU REALLY JUST ARE SCREENING FOR RIGHT WHEN THAT BABY IS BORN RIGHT IN THE NURSERY RIGHT IN THIS FIRST FEW DAYS IS TO JUST LOOK FOR RED REFLEX YOU KNOWIN YOU TAKE A CAMERA PICTURE O FLASH PICTURE AND SOMETIMES GET RED EYE THAT'S ACTUALLY THE LIGHT FROM THE FLASHES YOU KNOW REFLECTING AGAINST THE RATIN I'M COMING BACK OUT OF YOUR EYE IT LOOKS RED AND I'M AND A RED REFLEX IS ACTUALLY VERY NORMAL THAT'S THAT THAT'S GREAT AND IF YOU HAVE A NOT ONE OF A NUMBER OF DISEASES IN THE EYE THAT CAN PRESENT EVEN IN BABIES EVEN IN NEW BORN BABIES INCLUDING MOST CONCERNING BUT THANKFULLY LEAST COMMON RETINO BLASTOMA WHICH IS THE MOST COMMON PEDIATRIC I CANT SIR AH WHICH AGAIN THANKFULLY IS QUITE RARE AH THOSE BABIES WON'T HAVE A RED REFLEX IN THAT EYE IT'LL BE KIND OF A WHITISH OR GREAY REFLEX AND SO EVEN JUST THAT FIRST LITTLE YOU KNOW DOCTOR'S TAKEN THE LITTLE PENLIGHT AND EVEN JUST FLASHING IT IN TH IN THE BABY'S EYES SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S OUR FIRST I EXAMINE AND A D HOPEFULLY WE'VE ALL HAD THAT NOVULLY EVERY BABY BEING BORN TO DAY IS GETTING THAT GETTING THAT FIRST I EXAMINEIS REALLY JUST LOOKING FOR THAT RED REFLEX A IT'S NOT TYPICAL AS LONG AS THAT'S LOOKING GOOD AM TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING AN EY EXAM FROM THERE KIND O THREW A'M CHILDHOOD LIKE I MAYBE EARLY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL UNLESS THE BAT YOUR BABY IS PRESENTING WITH ONE OF A NUMBER OF FEATURES THET PARENTS OFTEN PICKUP ON FOR EXAMPLE AS THE BABES AGING THROUGH THOSE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS YOU KNOW THROUGH THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS BABIES ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE GREAT VISUAL ACUITY AND SO AS THEIR AGING OVER THOSE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS IT'S NORMAL FOR THEM TO HAVE IUN A ROVING I MUTE MOVEMENTS FOR EXAMPLEL BE SEARCHING THEIR ENVIRONMENT A'M BUT OVER THOSE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS OF PARENTS START NOTICING THE BABY ISN'T YOU KNOW ISN'T A A MAKING I CONTACT OR LOOKING WHERE A SOUND IS CERTAINLY IF THEY HAVE WHATS CALLED MY STAGNETS LIKE THESE RAPID FLICKERING AL TERNATING I MOVEMENTS ANYTHING LIKE THAT OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING TO TRIGGER TRIGGER AND I EXAM BUT OTHERWISE MOST BABIES OTHER THAN THER PEDIATRICION DOING THAT RED REFLEX CHECK WHEN THEY'RE IN FOR THE REGULAR WHILE CHILD CHECKS AH THAT'S REALLY ALL THAT'S A NEEDED THROUGH THAT WHEN MOST KIDS GET TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AGE THERE'LL OFTEN BE OFTEN DONE AT THE SCHOOLS AND AMBLEOPIA SCREENING EXAM IF KID'S EYES EITHER IF ONE EYE DOESN'T SEE THAT WELL LIKE MABE YOR VERY NEAR SIGHTED OR FAR SIGHTED IN ONE EYE AND PRETTY NORMAL SIGHTED IN THE OTHER OR THE TWO REFRACTIVE ERRORS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER A THAT CAN LEAD TO A CONDITION YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT ON THE PODCASS BEFORE CALLED AMBLIOPIA A WHICH IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MORE COMMON OR MOST COMMON I DISEASES OF CHILDREN OR IF THE EYES ARE IN A LINE YOU KNOW OURE EYE MOSCLES IN THE BRAIN BEHIND THEM AR REALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING THE TWO EYES LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEAD AND IF THAT'S NOT WORKING PROPERLY IN ONE EYE IS IS OFF KILTER AND THEREFOR THE IMAGE OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS FALLING ON DIFFERENT SPOTS O THE RATNETS NOT SINKING UPRIGHT IN THE BRAIN THAT CAN LEAD TO THIS DISEASE CONDITION CALLED AMBLIOPIA WHERE THAT EYE IS NO LONGER TALKING TO THE BRAIN PROPERLY AND THERE'S A PRETTY EASY SCREENING EXAM THAT CAN BE DONE FOR STRBUSINESS THE MISALLINEMENT OF THE EYES THAT KIDSLL DO AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THE OTHER MAIN PRESENTING SYMPTOM IF KIDS AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IS WHEN THEY ADMIT TO THEIR PARENTS I CAN'T SEE THE BOARD OR I CAN'T SEE THE TEACHER UP FRONT AND THEN THEY MIGHT BE QUITE NEAR SITED AND SO THAT WILL ALSO TRIGGER AND EXAM AND SO THOSE ARE USUALLY THE PARTS FOR FOR BABIES FOR TODDLERS FOR CHILDREN SCHOOL AGED CHILDREN THAT MIGHT REASONABLY TRIGGER AND EXAM COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT EARLY EEXAMSON WILL COM GET ON TO A I EXAMSON OLDER INDIVIDUALS ON A SECOND BUT I WONT INTERRUPT YOU WITH THIS QUESTION SO YOU MENTION THAT UN IF THERE CAN BE A MISSILINEMIEN OF THE EYES I'VE SEEN MANY PEOPLE'S BABIES WHERE THERE IS ONE EYEBALL THAT SEEMS TO BE CON A DRIFTING ARA OWN AND THEN IT MIGHT CORRECT BUT SOMETIMES THEY'LL HAVE WE DON ONE GET TECHNICAL HERE FUT FOR OUR LISTENERS WILL KEEP IT GENERAL BUT EITHEIR CONVERGION EYES OR ONE EYE CONVERGING CROSS EYES OR WALL EYED YOU KNOW AGAIN USING A THAT NON TECHNICAL LANGUAGE HERE A END MY NERSTANDING IS THAT THE BRAIN IS TAKING THAT INFORMATION IN AND IT'S VERY PLASTICK ITS CHANGING IN THESE EARLY STAGESO OF DEVELOPMENT AND THAT IT'S FAIRLY CRITICAL TO GET THAT STUFF CORRECTED EARLY ON BECAUSE IF YOU WAIT TOO LONG THE BRAIN CAN ESSENTIALY BECOME BLIND TO THE THE A OR RATHER THE THE BRAIN CANNOT LEARN TO HANDLE THE PROPER ALLINEMENT SO IN OTHER WORDS IF A KID HAS A CROSS EYES A CROSS EYES EXCUSE ME AND THEY'RE NOT CORRECTED UNTIL THEYR TWENTIES IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEY WILL NEVER RECOVER NORMAL VISION WHEREAS A YOU RECOVER IF YOU ALLINE THE EYES PROPERLY EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT THEY CAN INDEED RECOVER VISION HOW EARLY CAN INSHULD ONE CONSIDER GETTING THOSE IREALINEMENTS DONE YE YE PRETTY MUCH RIGHT ON WHAT THEY'LL DO AS IF THEY DETECT ANY EYE MISS ALINEMEN AND SOMETIMES PARENTS OR OR GOOD AT NOTICING THAT SOMETIMES YOU TAKE A PICTURE AND ONE EYE GOT THE RAD EYE REFLAX ON THE OTHER ONE DID INT AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE NOTICE THAT THEIR KIDS EYES OR SOR TURNING IN A SEEMS LIKE TOO MUCH IM SOMETIMES THERE'S WHAT'S CALLED PSEUDO STRABISMESS WHICH IS WHERE ACTUALLY DEPENDING ON YOUR ANATOM IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE EXTRA SKIN SORT OF ON THE INSIDE CORNERS OF YOUR EYES MAKES YOUR EYES LOOK TURNED IN WHEN ACTUALLY THEY'RE STRAIGHT IM BUT IF YOUR EYES ARE ACTUALLY TURNED IN OR SLIGHTLY LESS COMMON IN CHOLDER IND MERE COMMON IN ADULTS MITHS ALLINEMENT TURNED OUT I IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO CORRECT THAT EARI AND THE REASON IS AS YOU WERE SAYING THE BRAIN STARTS IGNORING IT IT FAILS TO FULLY DEVELOP THA STRONG CONNECTIONS FROM THE FOR THE DEED O COMING IN FROM ONE OF THOSE TOO EYES INTO THE BRAIN AND IF YOU PASS CERTAIN SORT OF THRESHOLDS DURING DEVELOPMENT DURING CHILDHOOD WITHOUT CORRECTING THAT CONNECTIVITY GETTING THOSE TWO EYES TO WORK TOGETHER PROPERLY M YOU CAN PERMANENTLY LOSE THAT IM AND SO WE USE SORT OF WE USED TO USE VERY SORT OF AU KNO GROSS NUMBERS LIKE IT'S FULLY CORRECTABLE IF YOU CAN INTERVENE BEFORE AGE THREE I'S PARTLY CORRECTABLE IF YOU CAN INTERVENE BEFORE AGE SIX YOU GOT A CHANCE BEFORE AGE NINE BUT IT TURNS OUT AND FOLLOW ON STUDIES THAT EVEN KIDS INTO THEIR YOUNG TEENS HAVE A SHAW AT CORRECTING THAT EYEBRAIN CONNECTION THAT AMBLEOPIA THAT THAT LOSS OF VISION AH THAT THAT CAN OCCUR DURING EARLY DEVELOPMENT SO EVEN IF YOU'RE ONLY YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY DETECTING THAT LATER ON IN CHILDHOOD OR EVEN SOR OF THE TWEEN YEARS OR EARLY TEEN YEARS IT'S STILL WORTH A TRY O REALLY PUSH TO IM RE TRAIN THE WEAKER EYE AND THEN ALSO REAL LINE THE MUSCLES SO THAT THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER TO KEEP THE EYES FOCUS I'LL TELL YOU IT'S INTERESTING AND THERE'S A LOT MORE TO LEARN ABOUT BLANK BRAIN PLASTICITY AND PROBABLY A LOT OF REALLY COOL NEW THARAPEES YET TO DISCOVER THAT COULD REOPEN WHAT'S CALLED CRITICAL PERIOD PLASTICITY THIS THIS THIS PLASTICITY THAT WE HAVE DURING DEVELOPMENT THE KIND OF GOES AWAY AS WE AGE AND AND THAT CRITICAL PERED PLASTICITIES YOU K NOWS BEEN THE BEST STUDIED ACTUALLY IN THE VISUAL SYSTEM AND THE IDEA THAT WE COULD REOPEN THAT IS REALLY FANTASTIC BUT FOR DIFFERENT PARTS OF THAT EYEBRAINE CONNECTION THERE'S DIFFERENT PERIODS FOR CRITICAL PERIOD PLASTICITY FOR EXAMPLE EVEN IF YOU GET THE AMBLEOPIC EYE TO SEE WELL AGAIN AND THEN YOU REALLINE THE EYES AND NOW THEIR WORKING TOGETHER A LOT O KIDS WILL NEVER RECOVER FULL DEPTH PERCEPTION STERIOPSIS THE USE OF TWO EYES TO SEE DEPTH FOR EXAMPLE SO WHY THAT PART OF THE BRAIN DOESN'N CORRECT AS WELL AS THE VISUAL ACUITYOR CENTRAL VISION PART OF THE BRAIN I'M NOT SURE IF WE UNDERSTAND THA  UMON ASK FOR CURBSIDE CONSULT AS I'D SOMETIMES CALLED RIGHT NOW A BY TELLING YOU A STORY WHEN I WAS A KID I WENT SWIMMING WITHOUT GOGGLES AND I HAD ONE E CLOSED AND THE OTHER I OPEN AND CLOSING AS IT WENT IN AND OU THE WATER BECAUSE I'M A DEFICIENT SWIMMER AND I ONLY BREATHED TO ONE SIDE UNLESS I REALLY CONSCIOUSLY FORCED MYSELF TO BREATHE THE BOTH SIDES IN A FREESTILE SWIM GOT OUT F THE POOL AND I WA SEEN DOUBLE IT WAS PRETTY EARIE AND THEN IT BECAME DOWNRIGHT SCARY BECAUSE I DIDN'T RECOVER MY DOUBLE VISION UNTIL THEY PATCHED ONE OF THE EYES  FORCING ME TO USE THE OTHER EYE THAT HAD BEEN CLOSED THE ENTIRE TIME AND FORTUNATELY THIS WAS DONE EARLY ENOUGH AND I WAS YOUNG ENOUGH THAT WITHIN I THINK IT WAS ABOUT A DAY OR SO I RESTORED WHAT NORMAL VISION HOWEVER MY DEPTH PERCEPTION IS TERRIBLE I I'M THE KID THAT YOU KNOW FLY BALL IS IT TO ME AND IN THE OUTFIELD THAT I'S COMING'S COMING THAT IT HIT ME THIS IS WHY IVE GENERALLY FOCASED ON FOOTSPORTS THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE LIFE AS SUPPOSED O YOU KNOW PRECISE I HAND I CORDINATION I'M BETTER AT THROWING DARTS AND THINGS WITH ONE EYE CLOSE THAN I EVER WOULD BE WITH BOTH EYES MAYBE THAT'S TRUE FOR MOST PEOPLE QUESTION I HAVE IS IS IT TRUE THAT EVEN JUST A FEW HOURS OF MISALIGNEMENT OF INFORMATION TO THE TWO EYES EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT CAN PERMANENTLY REWIRE THE BRAIN UNLESS THERE ARE SOME CORRECT IF MEASURES AND SUCH AS PATCHING OUP ONE EYE I'M AND THE EXAMPLE I GAVE IS JUST ONE BUT FOR INSTANCE IF IM I YOU KNOW SOME ONE INJURES YOUNGEST A SCRATCH ON THEIR CORNY AND THEY CLOSED HAT THEY PATCH THE EYE AND THE PERSON HAPPENS TO BE TEN YEARS OLD IS IT IMPORTANT TO THEN PATCH THE OTHER HEALTHY EYE AFTER THAT THE I'M YOU KNOW THAT THE SCRATCHED EYE IS FEELING BETTER IN OTHER WORDS HOW CRITICAL IS IT TO INSURE THE BALANCE OF INFORMATION COMING INTO THE TWO EYES EVEN ON THE ORDER OF HOURS OR DAYS YOUR STORY IS I I HAD SOME FEATURES OV I YOU KNOW TOTALLY USUA ULL HOW WE THINK ABOUT MISALLINED EYES LEADING TO AMBLEOPIA WHERE ONE EYES WEAKER PATCHING THE STRONG EYES TO THE WEAK EYE CAN RECOVER BUT NOT NESARILY FULLY REGAINING DEPTH PERCEPTION AND SO THAT PART OF IT IS YOU KNOW QUITE STURYA TYPICAL THE PART OF YOUR STORY THAT'S A TYPICAL IS THAT FOR MOST KIDS A AN HOUR OR TWO LET ALONE MINUTES AN HOUR TO EVEN AN HOUR OR TWO A DAY IF YOU WERE GOT ENOUGH YOUERE A YOUNG KID AND YOU JUST REALLY WERE TRAINING UP ON THROWING DARTS AND YOU ARE JUST KEEPING ONE EYE CLOSE TO THROW THE DARTS IN OW REALLY PRACTICING FOR AN HOUR OR DAY IT BE VERY UNUSUAL FOR THAT TO TRIGGER THIS KIND OF EITHER STRABISMISMISALLINEMENT OF THE EYES LET ALONE AMBLYOPIA AND THISTER BUSINESS IS WHAT'S GIVING YOU THE DOUBLE VISION CAUSE THEY'RE MISS A LINE LETTAE ON THE AMBLI AMLYOPI OF ONE EYE TURNING OUT WEAKER IF I HAD TO GUESS OF COURSE NOT HAVING YOU KNOW DONE YOUR EXAMN BEFORE THAT FATEFUL DAY IN THE SWIMMING POOL IF I HAD TO GUESS I WOULD GUESS THAT YOU MAY HAVE HAD SOME INTERMITTENT STRABUSINESS AND YOUR BRAIN WAS ALREADY GETTING CUNNA HIT AND AND YOU NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PARENTS MAY HAVE EVEN NO DESTITI COULD BE HAPPENING YOU KNOW AT OTHER TIMES A DAY OR YOU'RE NOT KIND OF REALLY PAYING A TENTION IT DOESN'T CIND A STAND OUT IN THE WAY THAT THAT THAT DAY THAT THAT YOU GOT OUT OF THE SWIMMING POOL YOU REALLY NOTICED IT AND IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THAT STRONG IT MAYHAVE BEEN QUITE INTERMITTEN BUT IF YOU HAD HAD SOME YEARS OF INTERMITTAN ESOTROPIA OR TURNING IN OF THE EYES OR EXCETROPIA TURNING OUT OF THE EYES THAT JUST HAPPENED HERE AND THERE BUT WAS A CUMULATING SORT OF A DAMAGE YOUR FAILURE TO CONNECT OVER YEARS LEADING UP TO THAT DAY IN THE SWIMMING POOL AND THAT TAGE JUST TIPPED YOU OVER THE EDGE AND YOU'E GOT DOUBLE VISION YOU REALLY NOTICED IT THAT LED TO AN I EXAMINED AND I CARE PROVIDER AND THEY SAT WEIGHT A SECOND THIS EYES STRONGER THIS EYES WEAKER YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE AMBLYOPIA WERE AND A START PATCHING YOUR STRONG EYES YOU CAN GET YOUR WEAK EYE BACK SO FOR NINETY NINE POINT NINE PER CENT OF THE KIDS WHO LIKE YOU KNOW Y THEY GET A LITTLE CORNEAL SCRATCH OR THE PATCHING WHEN I CLOTHED OR OR IYOU KNOW ANYTHING THAT SORT OF A RARE EVENT LIKE THAT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT PARENTS DONE AFH TO WORRY KIDS CAN BE KIDS THAT CAN PLAY THAT CAN DO THAT KIND OF THING AND I AND NOT AFE TO WORRY AND AD AND AND IT'S UNFORTUNATETHAT WE CAN'T TELL IN ADVANCE WHICH KIDS BEEN HAVING THE INTERMIT NAMBLEYOU BUT BECAUSE WE DON'T DO A STANDARD I EXAMINE EVERY FIVE YEAR OLD WHO'S NOT COMPLAINING OF ANYTHING BUT BUT YES SO THAT'S AN THAT'S AN UNUSUAL CASE IN YOURS AND IF I HAD TO GUESS I I WOULD BAT THAT YOU WERE HAVING SOME SORT OF SOBCLINICAL UNTRACKED UNCHARTED UNNOTICED MAYBE STRABUSNESS LEAVING UP TO THAT POINT THANK YOU YOU CAN SEND ME A BILL AN A ALONG THOSE LINES I'M FORTY SEVEN YEARS OLD SO I WAS OPART OF THE GENERATION THAT GREW UP WITH SOME COMPUTERS IN THE CLASSROOM BUT NOT A LOT A NOWADAYS KIDS FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE ARE LOOKING AT EYE PADS AND PHONES AND SCREENS AND THINGS VERY CLOSE UP AND THERE IS A WEALTH OF EXPERIMENTAL ANIMAL DATA SHOWING THAT IF YOU LIMIT VISION TO UP JUST CLOSE RANGE THAT THE EYBALL LENGTHENS AND THEREFORE THE VISUAL IMAGE FALLS IN FRONT OF AND NOT DIRECTLY ON TO THE NERLRETINA THE ESSENTIALLY THE LIGHT SENSING PORTION OF THE OF THE EYE AND THOSE ANIMALS BECOME MYOPIC OR NEAR SIGHTED WHAT CAN WE SAY ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN WHICH KIDS ARE SEEN FROM THE TIME THEY'RE BORN THROUGH LET SAY ADOLESCENCE IN THEIR TEEN YEARS IN TERMS OF HOW THEIR VISUAL SYSTEM WIRES UP AND ARE THERE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE COMING FROM THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE CLENICAL STUDIES CLINICAL TRIALS CUSE ME OR OTHERWISE THAT INDICATE WHAT A HEALTHY VISUAL ENVIRONMENT CONSISTS OF YAH YA THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND ACTUALLY IT'S REALLY RALEVANT THESE DAYS BECAUSE A YOU KNOW MYOPIA IS SO COMMON I IT'S MORE COMMON I'M IN ASIAN POPULATIONS YOU KNOW IT'S CALLED AN EPIDEMIC AN CHINA AIN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A LOT OF ASIAN HARIDAGE OR ASIAN AMERICANS AND SO WE SEE A LOT LIKE A STANDFORD WE SEE A LOT OF AM YOU KNOW MYOPIA IN KIDS AND ADULTS AND REALLY STARTING YET THOUGHTFUL ON THE SCIENCE OF MYOPIA CONTROL HOW TO WE HOW DO WE PROVIDE THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENTS NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT FOR DECADES THE ASSUMPTION SOME OF THE DADA REALLY LATTICE TO THE PATH OF THINKING LIKE GOSH THE MORE YOU SPEND AT NEAR ACTIVITIES AND THESE ARE MAUSE MODEL EXPERIMENTS LIKE YOU DESCRIBE BUT ALSO WELL DESIN HUMAN COHORT STUDIES YOU KNOW FIGURING OUT LIKE ASKING YOU KNOW KIDS AN FAMILIES LIKE HOW LONG IS YOUR KID READING OR IN FRONT OF THE COMPUTER HOW MYOPIC ARE THA HOW NEAR SIGHTED OR THAY VERSES HOW MUCH TIME IS YOUR KID IN FRONT OF THE COMPUTER OR DOING NEAR WORK HOW MYOPIC ARE NEAR SIGHTED OR THEY AND THE AS WELL DESIN COHORT SUDIES DID POINT TOREWORDS THIS CONCEPT THAT IF YOU DO TOO MUCH NEAR WORK AS A KID THAT YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP NEAR SIGHTEDNESS AS YOU GET THROUGH THIS THE SORT OF YOU KNOW A PRETEN AN EVEN INTO THE TEEN YEARS WHICH IS WHEN MOST OF THAT MYOPIA PROGRESSION OR IBALL ELONGATION IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING TO CAUSE NEAR SIGHTEDNESS IT'S ONLY BEEN IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT SOME REALLY EXCITING STUDIES OF ACTUALLY POINTED IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND THAT'S THAT MAYBE IT'S NOT ALL NOT TO SAY IT'S NOT ABOUT NEAR ACTIVITY BUT MAYBE IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT NEAR ACTIVITY MAYBE IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE KIND OF LIGHT WE'RE GETTING INTO OUR EYES AND I THINK YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN THEY'VE NOW STUDIED AND ASKED THE KIDS INSTEAD OF JUST HOW MUCH NEAR AND HOW MUCH FAR YOU DOINE HOW MUCH TIME YOU'RE SPENDING INDOORS IN INDOOR LIGHTING WHICH DOESN'T HAVE FULL SPECTRUM LIGHT IN A TYPICAL INDOOR ENVIRONMENT VERSE IS HOW MUCH TIME YOU'RE PENDING OUTDOORS PLAYING IN THE YARD YOU COULD BE READING OUTSIDE BUT WHAT ARE YOU WAT WHAT KIND OF TIME ARE YOU SPENDING OUTSIDE AND AND T OF COURSE WHEN YOU'RE OUTSIDE IN SONLIGHT EVEN IT'S INDIRECT OME LIGHT YOU'RE GETTING A DIFFERENT SPECTRUM OF KIND OF FULL SPECTRUM LIGHTING FROM THE SUN AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S PRETTY CLEAR NOW ACTUALLY THAT IT HAS MAYBE MORE TO DO WITH OUTDOOR LIGHTING TIME THAN JUST NEAR WORK AND SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE ACTUALLY ALREADY SEEN THE FIRST COUPLE RANDOM IS CONTROLLED TRIALS WHERE THEY'RE HAVING KIDS INTENTIONALLY SPENDING TIME OUT DOORS VERSES SORT OF STANDAR LIFE WHICH YOU KNOW IS GOING TO BE OFFIN MUCH MORE INDOOR TIME AND AND SEEING SOME EFFECTS YOUV FOLLOW THOSE KIDS OVER A COUPLE OF YEARS AND THE KIDS YOU SPEND TIME OUTDOORS ARE ARE PROGRESSING IN THEIR NEAR SIGHTED NESS LASS LIKE THE'RE THEY'RE NEAR SIGHTED PRESCRIPTION IS NOT GETTING AS STRONG AS THE KIDS WERE SPENDING MORE TIME INDOORS AND THERE'S SOME PRETTY GOOD BIOLOGY THAT'S GETTING WORKED OUT GOING BACK TO ANIMAL MODELS MORE ABOUT ABOUT HOW THAT MIGHT BE WORKING IN THE RATINA IN THIS INSIDE THE EYE BUT IT'S PRETTY COMPELLING A CONCEPTAN AND SO YOU KNOW AS A PARENT YU YOU MAY WANT TO BE YOU MAY WANT TO BE TELLING YOUR KID LIKE OKE YEI WANT YOU TO READ THAT BOOK OR YOU KNOW  IF YOU'RE KID'S PLAN ON THE PHONE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR THE EYE PAT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY'RE ALLOWED THAT TIME OH KAY YOU CAN HAVE THAT TIME BUT I WANT YOU TO SPEND SOME OF THE TIME THAT YOU'RE DOING THAT OUTDOORS ARE THERE ONLY THRESHOLDS FOR THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT ONE WOULD SUGGEST THEIR CHILD BE OUTDOORS I'M TO GET THAT FUL SPECTRUM LIGHT IT'S A GREAT QUESTION YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT COHORT STUDIES WHERE WE JUST ASK PEOPLE WHAT ARE TH A DOING AND THERE SEEMS TO BE YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT WELL CALL A DOSE DEPENDENT RESPONSE MAY BE THE MORE TIME OUT DOORS MIGHT BE BATTER WE DON'T KNW IF THERE'S AN OPERA LIMIT LIKE OSH IF YOU GO OVER TWO OR THREE HOURS THERE'S NO ADITIONAL BENEFIT TALK ABOUT THAT N COHORT STUDIES THE REAL GOLD STANDARD FOR ANSWERING THESE KINDS OF QUESTIONS OUR RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS AND SPECICALLY PLACEBO CONTROLED OR OR A CONTROL GROUP THAT'S NOT GETTING THE INTERVENTION THAT'S OUR HIGHEST LEVEL OF EVIDENCE FOR CLINICAL EVIDENCE FOR FOR ANY OF THIS KIND OF SCIENCE AH WHEN WERE TIME AOUT HUMANS OR PRECLINICAL MODELS IN THE LABORATORY AND THE STUDY THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE YET TO REALLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION IS TO RANDOMIZE KIDS TO TELLING THIS GROUP OF KIDS YOU JUST DO YOUR NORMAL LIFE TELL THIS GROUP OF KIDS WE WANT YOU OUTSIDE AN HOUR THIS GROUP OF KIDS WE WANT YOU OUTSIDE TWO HOURS A DAY THIS GROUP O KID THREE HOURS A DAY AND SEE BETWEEN THE GROUPS IS THERE A BIG DIFFERENCE LIKE WE HAVE PRETTY GOOD EVIDENCE NOW FROM THE STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE OR TWO HOURS IT'S CLEARLY THERE IS FIVE MINUTES ENOUGH IS FIVE HOURS BATTER AND ON'T THINK WE KNOW THE ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS YET LIKE WHAT'S THE RIGHT DOSE AH BUT THERE'S PROBABLY AT LEAST SOME DOSE DEPENDENCE TO THAT AND I CAN IMAGINE IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARD TO TEASE APART THE NEAR FAR VIEWING FROM THE INDOOR OUTDOOR BECAUSE YES OF COURSE A CHILD COULD BE OUTSIDE ON AN EYE PAD UPCLOSE BUT IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT SOME POINT THEY AREN'T SEEING OFFINTO THE DISTANCE FAR VIEWING AS IT'S CALLED AND THE REVERSE IS ALSO TRUE IF YOU'RE INDOORS UNLESS YOU LIVE IN A VERY VERY LARGE HOME OR YOU'RE STARING OFF A BALCONY FAR VIEWING IS MUCH HARDER TO ACHIEVE SO IT'S AND PERHAPS IT ISN'T IMPORTANT TO ISOLATE THESE VARIABLES ALTHOUGH I CAN SEE THE CHALLENGE IN DEVELOPING A REALLY GOOD CLINICAL TRIAL RANOMI'S CLINICAL TRIAL FOR THIS MEANWHILE I I EAT IM KONS I'LL GO INTO THE GRAVE SHOUTING YOU KNOW OR SAYING RATHER AND SUGGESTING THAT PEOPLE GET SOME MORNING SOME LIGHT IN THEIR EYES TO SET THEIR CIRCATIANE RHYTHM AM BUT FAR VIEWING A FEW AT LEAST A FEW MINUTES AN IDEALLY HOURS PER DAY ER A MIXTURE OF NEAR AND FAR VIEWING BY BEING OUT DOORS JUST SEEMS A GOOD THING TO DO REGARDLESS OF AGE SO R THERE ANY DATA IN OLDER PEOPLE NOT IN A SERLY ELDERLY BUT OLDER PEOPLE SO AN PEOPLE IN THEIR FROM SAY TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE INTO THEIR SIXTIES OR SEVENTIES THAT GETTING OUT DOORS AND GETTING THIS FULL SPECTRUM LIGHT IS HEALTHY FOR THE EYE IN WAYS THAT ARE SEPARATE FROM THE KNOWN HEALTHY EFFECTS OF DOING THAT ON CIRCATEAN RHYTHM SETTING YEH YEH THE CIRCADIUM PARTS PRETTY CLEAR THE IN MOST PATION IN MOST IN MOST PEOPLE THEN Y THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEAR SIGTEDNESS HAPPENS A LOT UNTIL AGE TEN LITTLE MORE THROUGH AGE TWANNY LITTLE MORE THAN THAT INTO THE IN YOU KNOW IN THROUGH THE TWENTIES UP TO THIRTY TINY BIT IN THE THIRDIES UP TO THORTY BUT USUALLY BY THOSE LATER AGES YOUR PRESCRIPTION MIGHT BE CHANGING A QUARTER OF A DIATER THAT'S THE MEASUREMENT THAT WE USE WHEN WE YOU KNOW GIVE YOU YOUR GLASSES PRESCRIPTION A QUARTER OF A DIAPTER HALF A DIAFTER IF COULD GET A HALF TIAPTER MORE NEAR SITED OR LAST NEAR SIGTED YOU KNOW ONCE YOUR AGING INTO YOUR FORTIES FIFTIES AND BEYOND SO MOST OF THE ACTION ON NEAR CITEDNESS DEVELOPMENT IS ACTUALLY REALLY HAPPENING IN THE YOUNGER AGES SO AGAIN THE THE PREMIS OF INTERVENING IN AN OLDER PERSON AND I'LL JUST INCLUDE YOU AND ME AN OLDER PEOPLE FOR THE SAKE OF THIS DAFFINITION AS MUCH AS I'M RETICENT TO DO THAT IN GENERAL A I THINK THE THAT THE PREMIS OF INOF IT OF OF SORT OF LIGHT MODULATION FOR NEAR SIGHTEDNESS IN OLDER PEOPLE IS PROBABLY PROBABLY NOT SO STRONG I THINK THER'RE A LOT OF OTHER BENEFITS YOU'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT CIRCATEAN RHYTHM THERE'RE SO MANY HEALTH BENEFITS TO EXERCISE AND YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GETTING OUT DOORS THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE YOU'RE GOIN TO BE WALKING ISICLNO SO SO EXERCISE VALUE FOR THE HEALTH OF OUR EYES AND THE REST OF OUR BODY IS CLEARLY THERE ABUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S REALLY A STRONG PRAMESS THAT YOU'RE GING TO CHANGE YOUR GLASS'S PRESCRIPTION YOU KNOW WIN OUR FORTIES OR FIFTIES OR ER BEYOND I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED  G ONE IS A VITEMIN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL F YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE POD CAST THERE ISN I STARRY TAKING ATHLETIC GRENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLTIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO ME THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GOT IS VERY IMPORTANT IS POPULATED BY GOP MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE MAN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIOTICS AN ATHLETIC GRENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLETIC GRENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTIGINS VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASE CRIPE IF YOU' LIKE TO TRYATHLTIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD AN THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMIN D THREE K TOO AGAIND THAT'S ATHLETI GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY A VITEM IN D THREE K TO PROBABLY WORTH TOUCHING ON SOME OF THE DEWS IN SOME OF THE DON'TS FOR I HEALTH GENERALLY A AND THEN I PROMISE SOMEONE TO GET US BACK TO ADULT I EXAMS MSIVOLOTIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT I CAN IMAGINE THAT IT'S PROBABLY NOT A GREAT IDEA TO BE EXPOSED TO EXTREMELY BRIGHT LIGHT IN THIS IS WHY PEOPLE WHO WELLED WHERE I SHIELDS  BUT OF COURSE MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT WELDING A WHAT OTHER SORTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ARE DETRIMENTAL TO OUR VISION HEALTH ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN  INCLUDING BRIGHTNESS OF LIGHT WE TALKIG OVIT ABOUT INEAR FAR I'M OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO KEEP TOXENS AND ACIDS AN SOLVENS AND THINGS OUT OF THE EYE BUT WHAT DO YOU SEE I MIKE AS AWFULLY NOT COMMONLY BUT WHAT ARE SOME TOF THINGS THAT YOU FEEL MIGHT NOT BE DISCUSSED ENOUGH IN TERMS OF MY HEALTH YOO YOU KNOW I THINK AT ALL AGES I SAFETY IS SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT ENOUGH AM YOU KNOW OUR EYES ARE DELICATE THE FRONT SURFACE OF THE EYE THE CORNIA THE CLEAR WINDOW THAT LETS THE LIKE GO IN THE OR EYE THAT'S A DELICATE VERY SENSITIVE STRUCTURE IT'S THIN MAYBE A MILIMETER AT THE THICKEST A HALF MILIMETER IN THE CENTER OF OUR EYE A THE RATINA IS IT IT'S NURL TISSUE THITS LIKE REALLY AN OUTGROWTH OF THE BRAIN THIS IS VERY SENSITIVE ITS SUBJECT TO DEGENERATIVE DISEASE AND INJURY OUR EYES EVEN IF THEY JUST GET HIT CAN GET VERY INFLAMED OUR EYES CAN BE MORE IN FLAMATORY THAN A BRUISE ON OUR SKIN ON OUR SHOULDER MIGHT BE SO EYE SAFETY'S A BIG ONE AND PEOPLE WHO ARE A WORKING IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES A YOU KNOW ANY ONE IS DOING ANY METAL GRINDING PEOPLE WHO ARE EVEN JUST GARDENING YOU KNOW AND IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE DOING SOME SIGNIFICANT GARDENING AND CUTTING AND YOU COULD YOU KNOW FLACK A LITTLE BIT OF DIRTAN ANOTHERE'S A LOT O THERE'S A LOT O FOR EXAMPLE FUNGUS THAT LIVES IN THE GROUND NATURAL STUFF IT'S ALL VERY NORMAL IN IN THE EARTH BUT YOU KNOW OUR EYES AREN'T REALLY MADE TO ABSORB THAT FUNGUS AND AND HAVE HAVE A PIECE OF DIRT KIND OF STICK IN OUR EYE LIKE THAT AND SO PEOPLE ARE AT RISK I THINK FOR YOU KNOW FOR NOT AND WE SEE TOO MUCH KIND OF REALLY UNNECESSARY I INJURY EYE TRAMA THAT IF PEOPLE WORE EITHER THE GLASSES CAUSE THEY HAPPEN TO WEAR PRESCRIPTION GLASS IS OR GOGGLES OR FOR MORE ADVANCED WORK OU NOW SAFETY GOGGLES OF COURSE A IF YOU'RE SANDINGED OIND WOODSHOP PROJECTS ANYTHING LIKE THAT SAWING INCLUDING YOU KNOW AGAIN IN A GARDEN CUTTING THINGS I'M YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK I SAFETY YOU KNOW I TRAMA IS A BIG ONE AND YOU KNOW WE PROBABLY SEE ONE OR TO I'M WHAT WE CALL OPEN GLOBES A WEEK COME INTO THE OPERA INTO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND 'M YOU KNOW THOSE ARE TOUGH BECAUSE YOU KNOW GAN THE EYES DELICATE AND CAN DO A LOT O HEALING BUT BUT NOT INFINITE RIGHT AND SO WE REALLY YOUKOW THAT'S THAT'S ONE THAT I THINK IT'S REALLY AN UNTAPPED OPPORTUNITY IS JUST A LITTLE MORE EDUCATION AROUND IM AROUND I PROTECTION PROTECTING AGAINST ITRAMA WHAT ABOUT I CLEANLINESS YOF THERE'S SOME PRETTY DRAMATIC VIDIOS ALSO I PUT SOME OF THESE ON MY INSTOGRAM HANDLE OF OF THESE ARE EM OUR EYES OF PEOPLE RUBBING THEIR EYEBALLS AND PEOPLE REALLY GETTING A SENSE OF FORS OF ALL EVERY STATEMENT OF WHAT YOU SAID GETTING A REAL SENSE OF JUST HOW MUCH THE EYES ARE AN OUTGROWTH OF THE BRAIN CAUSE OF THE OP WHEN YOU SEE WITH THE OPTIC NERVES AND ALL THEIR BEAUTY AND THE EYEBALLS MOVING AROUND IS SOME ONE RUBS THEIR IYES IVE TO IMAGINE THAT RUBING EYEBALLS A LITTLE BIT AS BAD BUT ACTUALLY CALLED YOU I DON'T IF YOU REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A A JUNIOR PROFESSOR I WOKE UP FROM A NAP ONE DAY AND I COULDN'T SEE HOW TO ONE EYE IT'S FREAKING OUTS OF COURSE I CALL TO YOU AND I HAD PRESSURE BLINDED MYSELF BY FALLING ASLEEP ON MY HAND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND YOU ASSURED ME THAT MY VISION WOULD COME BACK AND INDEED IT DID SO YOU PLAYD DUEL ROLL OF OPTHEMAL JUST AND PSYCHIATRICE THANK YOU AND INDEED I CAN SEE OT OF BOTH EYES AM NOW AM BUT RUBBING OUR EYES GETTING GUNK IN OUR EYES YOU KNOW I THINK UNLESS SOMEBODY HAS LOST THEIR VISION TEMPORARILY IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THIS IS LIKE A BIG DEAL BUT WHEN IT HAPPENS IT IS TRULY FRIGHTENING 'RE SO DEPENDENT ON VISION SO UM YEN WHAT AE YOU RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT RUBBING ORE NOT RUBBING EYEBALLS ABOUT A HANDWASHING AND CLEANLINESS AND ALSO HOW DO YOU WASH AND I PROPERLY I USE SOAP AND FLUSH IT WITH WATER YOU JUST FLUSH IT WITH WATER YOU'D NOT EVEN DO THAT U SAILINE AND IT REALIZE HES MY SONDENLY LOW LEVEL QUESTIONS BUT THESE OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE DEAL WITH ON ONULL TOO FREQUENT BASIS YA YOU DON'T FOR MOST PEOPLE MOST OF THE TIME ACTUALLY THE EYES ARE A VERY GOOD CLEAN ENVIROMENT AND ACTUALLY OUR TEARS AR ARE CONTAIN ENZIMES THAT HELL BREAK DOWN BACTERIA AND BACTERIAL TOXSINS AND SO FOR MOST PEOPLE REGULAR EYEWASHING DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ANY PART OF THEIR STANDARD ROUTINE IN TERMS OF THE SURFACE OF THE EYE THE PART OF YOUR EYE THE CONJING TIA A OVER THE WHITES OF THE EYES UNDERNEATH THE EYELIDS ANYTHING UNDERNEATH THE EYELIDS IT'S PRETTY SELF CLEANING AND ACTUALLY OURE CURE PRODUCTION IN BLINKING IS VERY GOOD AT KEEPING OUR EYES CLEAN AH THE EYE LIDS EE LASHES CAN BE ANOTHER STORY AND ESPECIALLY AS WE AGE AH WE CAN YOU KNOW LIKE OUR SKIN IS BREAKING DOWN A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY THAN WHEN WE ARE YOUNGER YOU CAN DEVELOP WHAT WE SORT OF NICKNAMED SCIRF WHICHIS LIKE ON LITTLE DEAD SKIN BITS THAT ACCUMULATE AROUND THE EYELASHES A LOT OF PEOPLE DEVELOP WHAT WE CALL BLEPERYDAS WHICH JUST JUST JUST MEANS INFLAMMATION OF THE EYELASHES YE AND FOR THAT DOING SOME EYE SCRUBS AS A GOOD IDEA THEY ACTUALLY SELL A LITTLE PADS THAT YOU CAN BEYE ON A LITTLE THAT YOU RIP OPEN AND YOU CAN USE TO KIND OF LIGHTLY CLEAN THE EYELASHES AH BUT YOU CAN ALSO JUST USE LIKE A NO MORE TEARS BABY CHAMPOO JUST PUMP A LITTLE BIT INTO THE PALM OF YOUR HAND ONCE OR TWICE A DAY AH LET A LITTLE A WHTDILUDEIT WITH A ITTLE WATER AND UNDER THE SINK AND EITHER WITH YOUR FINGER OR EDGE OF A WASH CLOTH JUST VERY LIGHTLY RUB THE EYELASHESWHET I LIKE TO DO TILL THE EYES CLOSES WITH THE EYES CLOSE AND AND DON'T SCRENCH THEM CLOSE TOO TIGHT BECAUE YOU'RE ACTUALLY BURYING THE EYELASHES WHEN YOUD DE THE THE ROOTS OF THE EYELASHES WHEN YOU REALLY SCRUNCHED US JR JUST GENTLY CLOSE YOUR EYES JUST YEUN A REAL GENTLE CLOSURE AND THE JUST LIGHTLY SCRUB IT SHOULDN'T BE A BRACEOF YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO EXFOLIATE THE EYELIDS OR EYELASHES IN ANYWAY JUST LIGHTLY R UBD WITH THAT KIND OF DILUTE NO MORE TEARS BABY CHAMPOO AND TAT CAN REALLY HELP PEOPLE WITH THEIR EYE COMFORT IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU GOT SOMETHING IN YOUR EYE YOUR IDEAL EYEWASH IS ACTUALLY GONG TO BE A STERIL SALINE SOLUTION OF SALT WATER SOLUTION THAT YOU KNOW THEY SELL LITTLE BOTTLES OVER THE COUNTER AH EYEWASH SOLUTIONS LIKE THAT AT LOT OF PEOPLE WEAR CONTACTS WILL HAVE THAT KIND OF EYEWASH SOLUTION JUST A STERIL SALINE EYEWASH JUST PURE SALT WATER DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE ANY OTHER CHEMICALS OR PRESERVATIVES IN IT YOU CAN OF COURSE YOUS NOT ACTUAL A SEA WATER OR SALT WATER NOT SALT WATER THAN YE NOT SALT WATER OUT OF YOUR SALT POOL NI SALT WATER OUT OF THE OCEAN BUT LIKE A SALINE SALT WATER THAT'S AVAILABLE IN A STRIL NOW YOU CAN AWSO JUST USE ARTIFICIAL TEAR DROPS AND SOME OF THOSE COME IN NON PRESERVITIVE SOME OF THOSE COME PRESERVED VERSIONS THOSE ARE ALL ALSO COMPLETELY SAFE IN TO USE IN THE EYE AND THERE YOU CAN YOU KNOW YOU CAN SERT OF SPRITS INTO YOUR EYE OU  HOLD A LID OPEN AND GIVE IT A LITTLE SPRITS IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU GOT SOMETHING IN YOUR EYE PIECE OF DIRD OR LASH THAT'S NOT COMING OUT JUST TO RINCE IT BUT BUT HAVING LIKE A REGULAR ROUTINE YOU KOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HURD ANYTHING WITH THE OCCASIONAL EYERUBBING WE ALL DO THESE THINGS JUST KIND OF AS A YOUR KNOW EVEN A NERVOUS HABIT OR JUST ABSENT MINDEDLY YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT YOU NOW SCRATC YOUR ARM RUB YOUR EYES OR THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S FINE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HERD ANYTHING AH THERE ARE CONDITIONS WHERE PEOPLE SORT OF DEVELOP KIND OF A ALMOST LIKE A PSYCHO LOGICAL HABIT THEIR CERTAIN CONDITIONS WHERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO TOO MUCH EYE RUBBING IT CAN BE DANGEROUS IF YOU'RE IN THAT GROUP BUT FOR THE REGULAR RUN IN THE MILL EVERY DAY OCCASIONAL EYE RUBBING FINE IF YOU CERTAINLY YOU GET A LASH AND THERE AND YOU'RE TRYING TO RUB IT A BLANKET AND TEER IT OUT AH AND AGAIN IN THAT SITUATION IVIN USE SOME ARTIFICIAL TEARS WEDDING DROP SAILING DROPS AH THOSE WOULD BE THE WAY TO DO IT IT WOULDN'T INCREDIBLE TISSUE THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE IT YOU KNOW THE SELF CLEANING AND YET SO DELICATE TA PIECE OF THE BRAIN LITERALLY LINING THE BACK OF EACH OF OUR EYES LIKE THE LIKE OPI CRUSS TUMMING ITS REALLY REMARKABLE AM BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM OF COURSE I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT IS JUST IT IT NEVER CEASES TO TO AMAZE ME BUT'S TALK WHAT I EXAMS AND ADULTS SO PEOPLE ARE AWARE PRESUMELY THAT THEIR OPTOMATRISTS AND OPTHEMOLOGISTS I THINK IF IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DEFIND THEIR DIFFERENT AND ALSO OVERLAPPING ROLLS AND FOR THOSE THAT YOU KNOW OR PAST I SCHOOL AGE PROBABLY NOT GETTING I EXAMS UNLESS THEIR SENSING A PROBLEM AM PERHAPS NOT EVEN WITH BLURRY VISION AR OR DIFFICULTY SEEING AT A DISTANCE BUT SOMETIMES JUST WHAT FEELS LIKE FATIGUE OF THE EYES OR A HARD TIME MAINTAINING A LINEMENT OF THE EYES AM SO HOW OFTEN YOU RECOMMEND PEOPLE GET I EXAMS WHAT IS A TRUE REGULAR IY EXAM AND IS IT IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE GO TO AN OPTHEMOLOGIST OR WILL AN OPTOMATRISTS SUFFICE TYPICALLY OPTOMATRIS ORE LITTLE BUT EASIER FOR MOST PEOPLE TO ACCESS BECAUSE THERE'S USUALLY ONE SOME PLACE NEAR AN EY GLASS STORE AM SO WHAT ARE THE ROLLS HOW OFTEN SHE GET OUR ASCECT YA A OPTOMATRIS AN OPTHEMOLOGIST DO HAVE VERY OVERLAPPING ROLLS IN BEING I CARE PROVIDERS A THERE'RE SOMETHING OVER FORTY OR FIFTY THOUSAND OPTOMATRIST IN THE UNITED STATES THER' SOMEWHERE AROUND TWENTY THOUSAND OPTHEMOLOGISTS IN THE UNITED STATES OPTOMATRIST GET AN OPTOMATRY DEGREE THEY OFTEN HAVE O D AFTER THEIR NAME OPTHEMOLOGIST USUALLY WENT INA WEN TOMATICAL SCHOOLS THEY EITHER HAVE AN M D AFTER THEIR NAME OR THEY KIND OF A D OVERSION OF AMEDICAL DEGRE AND A AND THEN OPTOMATRIS WILL HAVE DONE ADDITIONAL PPLENICAL TRAINING IN THAT AIR IN THEIR AREA A AVICARE PROVISION OPTHEMOLOGIST EM D DOCTOR OPTHEMOLOGIST A CARE PROVIDERS IN ADDITION TO THAT TRAINING WILL HAVE DONE A SURGICAL TRAINING IN OPTHEMOLOGY A NOW THERE'S A LOT OF OVERLAP AND AM IN BOTHSENAREAS A YOU CAN BE GETTING YOUR SORT OF GENERAL EXAM TAKEN CARE OF MAY BE A SCREENING EXAM I THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN A TRADITIONAL DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN OPTOMATRIS AND OPTHEMOLOGISTS WITH OPTOMATRISTS PROVIDING A LITTLE MORE OF THE PRIMARY CARE ISCREENING MAYBE MANAGING EARLY DISEASE COMMON DISEASES AS WELL AWITH AMORE ADVANCE DISEASE OFFINS ORT OF UPGRATING TO PERHAPS SPECIALIST OPTHEMOLOGISTS IN THOSE AREAS BUT THAT DISTINCTION HAS BEEN A DECLINING OVER TIME IT'S STILL TRUE THAT IN I THINK MOST IF NOT ALL STATES ONLY THE EMDY OPTHEMOLOGISTS A SURGEONS CAN DO ISURGERIES BUT AM BOTH BOTH GROUPS OF I PARCARE PROVIDERS CAN DIAGNOSE BOTH CAN PRESCRIBE A APPROPRIATE I DROP TREATMENTS INCLUDING PRESCRIPTION I DROP TREATMENTS FOR FOR MANY OF OUR DISEASES A I DISEASES AND A AND IN SOME STATES OPTOMATRIS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY LOBBIED FOR A SORT OF EXPANDED RIHTS OF PROVIDING AIR CARE I CARE AND AGAIN AM ACCESS TO CARE FOR YOU KNOW THE REGULAR PERSON WHEREVER THEY MAY LIVE IS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT AND SO BEING ABLE TO ACCESS I CARE WHETHER IT'S WITH AN OPTOMATRIST IN YOUR COMMUNITY OR AN OPTHEMOLOGIST THAT MAY BE IN YOUR COMMUNITY OR MAY BE AT A DISTANCE I THINK THAT'S THE THE REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS TO ACCESS CARE NOW CINNOT LIKE RTOG HIM OUT WITH KIDS IF YOU'RE IN YOUR TEENS TWANIES MAYBE EVEN THIRDIES AND NOT HAVING ANY PROBLEM YOU'VE GOT NO COMPLAINTS YOU CAN SEE AT DISTANCE YOU CAN SEE IT NEAR A YOU KNOW SEE YOU CAN READ WITHOUT GLASSES YOU CAN DRIVE WITHOUT GLASSES AM YOU'RE NOT HAVING ANY IPANES YOU NOW PAINS AROUND THE EYES IN A REDNESS OF THE EYES YOU MAY NEVER PRESENT TO AN I CARE PROVIDER I THROUGH THE FIRST FOUR DECADES OF LIFE AND ALMOST ALL THE TIME IT'S GOINE TO BE O K RI IF YOU'RE NOT SYMPTEMATIC THE CHANCE YOU'VE GOT SOME TERRIBLE LURKING DISEASE IN THERE IS LOW BUT WE DO WISH THAT WE HAD A LITTLE MORE SCREENING GOING ON BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME DISEASES GLACOMA FOR EXAMPLE MY SPECIALTY THE TO MAIN RISK FACTORS FOR GLACOMA ORE INCREASING AGE AND IT USUALLY PRESENTS YOU KNOW IN MOST CASES ACTUALLY AFTER AGE FORTY BUT ALSO INCREASING EY PRESSURE AND IF YOUR EYE PRESSURE IS TOO HIGH YOU CAN'T FEEL THAT THAT WON'T FEEL FUNNY TO YOU IF IT SEARN A SLOWLY IS CRAPPED UP OVER THE YEARS AND SO FROM A SCREENING PERSPECTIVE IT IS GOOD TO GET SOME KIND OF SCREENING EXAM COULD BE AT A PUBLIC HOW FAIR COULD BE THAT YOU GO INTO THE LOCAL OPTOMA TRESS JUST SAY HAY I'VE NEVER BEEN CHECKED I'D LIKE TO BE CHECKED ONCES MAKE SURE EVERYTHINGS GOOD COULD YOU ASK FOR IT SARD IN TROUBLIN COULD SOMEBODY SAY I'D LIKE MY PRESSURES CHECK AS I RECALLED THE UPTOMASHES AGAINTO A PUFF TEST O IN A BLASPHEMAIRE I'M GET A SENSE OF HOW HOW RIGID OR OR UNSOFT AGAIN USING ANON CLINICAL NON TECHNICAL LANGUAGE HERE THAT THE EYEBALL HAPPENS TO BE I'M NOT RIGHT NOW BY THE WAY I'M SURE THERE ARE UNSEVERAL HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE THE EYES CLOSE TOUCHING THE SIDES OF THEIR EYEBALLS AND I'M ONLY HALF JOKING PLEASE DON'T DO THIS FOLKS I'M GIVEN THE CONVERSATION WE JUST HAD ABOUT MY CLEANLINESS AND I RUBBING BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE OLD FAT TRULY OLD FASHIOND I PRESSURE EXAM WAS YOU WOULD CLOSE YOUR EYES AND THE IAMOLOGIST TO A GENTLY PRESS AND SEE WHETHER OR NOT YOUR EYES WERE MORE RIGID THAN LAST TIME IS THAT RIGHT A THAT'S CALLED BALLOTMEN THAN YOU CAN KIN A YOU CAN YOU CAN KIND OF JUST TAKE ONE SACKOND IF YOU'R LESSENING AND PRESS ON YOUR EYES JUST VERY LIGHTLY AND YOU THERE'S A LITTLE GIVE OF COURSE THE EYELIDS PART OF THAT GIVE BUT BUT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT LIKE ROCK HAR D AND IF WE PRESS AND IT FEELS UNDER THE EYELID LIKE COSH SOMETHING UNDER THERE IS ROC HARD THEN WE KNOW SOMETHING IS WRONG THAT IS WAY TOO HIGH PRESSURE OF ITS ROCCARD BUT I'LL TELL YOU OUR ABILITY TO DIFFERENTIATE THE FINE POINTS OF EYE PRESSURE OTHER THAN ROCK HARD OR NOT ROCARD IS PRETTY LIMITED SO YET THE OPTOMATRIST OFFICE OR THE OPTHEMOLOGIST OFFICE AS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE SCREENING EXAM THEY'LL CHECK THE EYE PRESSURE THEY'LL LOOK AT THE SURFACS OF YOUR EYES MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S LOOKING HEALTHY THERE INCLUDING THE EYELIDS AND LASHES AND THE LOOK INSIDE THE EYE AND BE ABLE TO SCREEN FOR THESE DISEASES THAT WAY TO IN ADDITION TO CHECKING IF YOUR COMPLAINING OF ANY IN A BLURRINESS AT DISTANCE OR IT NEAR NOW AFTER AGE FORTY OR SO A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL PRESENT TO AN EYECARE PROVIDOR BECAUSE WE ALL GET WHAT'S CALLED PRESBIOPIA AND PRESBIOPIA JUST TRANSLATES TO DISEASE DEAVISION OF THE AGED SO YOU KNOW MYOPIA IS OUR WORD FOR NEAR SITED HYPEROPIA IS FARSITED ACTUALLY EMATROPIA MEANS NORMAL SITIT SI CAN SEE AT DISTANCE WITHOUT ANY GLASSES I'M EMATROPA BUT THEN WE ALL GET PRESBIOPIA AND AS WE AGE THE LENS INSIDE OUR EYE THAT'S HELPING FOCUS LIGHT ON TO OUR RATINA GET STIFFER SUCH THAT OR EY MUSCLES ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO RELAX AND RESHAPE THAT LENDS AND WE'RE NOT AS GOOD AS WE AGE AT MOVING OUR FOCUS FROM DISTANCE VISION DISTANCE VISION BY THE WAYS BASEWAY ANYTHING THREE FEET OR FURTHER AWAY YOU'RE BASICALLY VIEWING LIGHT RAYS COMING FROM INFINITY AT ONCE YOUR PAST THREE FEET SO THREE FEET OR FURTHER BEING ABLE TO FOCUS THAT IN TO FOURTEEN INCHES OR TWELVE INCHES WHICH MIGHT BE A NORMAL COMFORTABLE READING SPACE FOR YOU WE LOSE THAT ABILITY TO FLEX OUR LENDS RELAX OUR LENDS A REFOCUS OUR LENS FROM DISTANCE TO NEAR AND MOST PEOPLE ARE ROUND AGE FORTY COULD BE A COUPLE OF YEARS ABEFORE COULD BE FIVE OR TEN YEARS LATER THAT YOU NOTICE AT WHAT SORT OF A ROUND THAT TIME YOU START NEADING READING GLASSES YOU NEED A LITTLE EXTRA EVEN IF YOU CAN SEE FINE AT DISTANCE AND DON'T NEED PRESCRIPTION GLASSES FOR DISTANCE YOU NEED A BOOSTER YOU NEED READING GLASSES FOR NEAR I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'R EXPERIENCING THIS A TEI'M REALLY ENTRIGUED BY THIS BUT MAYBEYOU COULD CLARIFY WHEN YOU SAY READING GLASSES DO YOU MEAN JUST A MAGNIFIER BECAUSE I USE A YOU KNOW A POINT FIVE OR A POINT SEVEN FIVE MAGNIFIER FOR READING BUT I TRYING RELY ON THEM AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE AND I WANT TO GET TO THIS ABOUT USING GLASSES AS A CRUTCH IN THE PROBEBS WITH THAT  I HAVE A STORY ABOUT THAT TOO I SEEM TO HE KNOTS IT'S NO COINCIDENCE I DECIDE TO WORK ON VISION AND AFTER ALL UM HI'D MUCH OF VISION ISSUES  THAT FORTUNATELY ARE CORRECTED BUT YOU KNOW I I DO EXPERIENCE FORINCES WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING IF I LOOK AT MY PHONE WHICH BY THE WAY FOLKS I TRY AND GET OUTSIDE AND SEE SOME LIGHT FIRST BEFORE EVER LOOKING AT THE PHONE BUT I'LL NOTICE WHEN I FIRST LOOK AT MY PHONE IN THE MORNING THAT I CAN SEE IT VERY CLEARLY THROUGH MY RIGHT EYE BUT THAT IF I COVER MY RIGHT EYE MY LEFT EYES EXTREMELY BLURRY TO THE PON WHERE IM A I'M CALLING JEFF NI IM AMFRAID BUT THEN OVER THE COURSE OF MAYBE TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES IT RESOLVES AND I DON'T THINK IT'S BECAUSE SOMETHING IN MY EYE I DON'T THINK IT'S PRESSURE OF HAVING SLEPT ON THAT SIDE I DON'T THINK IT'S A LUBRICATION OF THE EYE ISSUE A BUT THE TWO EYES SEEM TO COME INTO FOCUS SO TO SPEAK UM AT DIFFERENT RATES EARLY IN THE DAY AND IF I POP MY READERS ON I CAN SEE RIGHT AWAY SO I WILL USE READERS LATE IN THE DAY OFTEN UM IF I WANT TO READ AT NIGHT SOMETHING I SOR IT TO SAY FEEL SO MUCH MORE RELAXING F LIKE  I LIKE I FINALLY RELAX WHEREAS OTHERWISE I REALIZE THAT I'M STRAINING IN ORDER TO SEE S IS THERE ANY UNCLENICAL CLENICAL DATA AN WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED YE HT YOU KNOW AND I'LL TELL YOU MY STORY THAT'S LIKE THAT AND I'M WE WERE LIVING DOWN IN SAN DIEGO WHEN YOU WERE AND I WERE BOTH PROFESSORS THAT YOU SEE SAN DIEGO AND AH WE HAD MOVED INTO A HOUSE AND I FOUND A PAIR OF GLASSES A PAIR OF READING GLASSIS I IN A CLOSET AND YOU KNOW WE ASKED AROUND YOU KNOW DID ANY THE GRAND PAIR ANDA LEAVE SOME GLASSES BEHIND ANDNOBODY SEEMED TO KNOW WHO THEY WERE SO HE WE FINALLY JUST DECIDED LIKE WELE I GUESS THE PEOPLE WHO MOVED OUT OF THE HOUSE JUST LEFT A PAIR OF GLASSES YOU KNOWIN THIS IN THE BACK OF THIS CLOSET AND THEN I TRIED THE GLASSES ON ND I LOOKED AT MY PHONE UP CLOSE AND WAS JUST LIKE OH MY GOD WAIT A SECOND I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW BLURRY MY NEAR VISION WAS AND THIS IS BACK I WAS ABOUT FORTY FORTY TWO SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO SO I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE UNTIL I PUT ON THE READERS AND THESE WERE PY NO ONE POINT TWO FIVE MAGNA FIRES YOU KNOW SO AN OFTOE MILE THAT RARELY MILE YONS YE AND I'LL TELL YO I GOT ADDICTED BECAUSE WHO DOESN'T LIKE GOOD VISION  RIGHT I MEAN AW MY GOD NOW I CAN MAKE THE TYPE SMALLER ON MY PHONE I CAN YOU KNO WAS WONDERFININ CAN RELAX A BIT THA BIN THE MUSCULATURE THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR FOR MOVING THE LENS AND FOCASSIN THE EYE AND THAN ALL THIS EXTRAOCULAR MUSCLATEER AND WE FORGET TEN I'M DEFFLY GOING CROW'S FEET UM AROUND MY EYES A PROBABLY CAUSE I ONS QWINT OR SOMETHING BUT YOU KNOW JUST THE ABILLYA RELAX ONE'S FACE IT JUST FEELS LIKE YON'T AN MORE MORE ENERGY IF LIKE CAN BE DEVOTED WHAT WERE ATUALLY LOOKING AT IM NOT MAKING LIGHT OF THEM YE WELL PRETTY SOON I JUST KEPT THAT ONE PAIR OF GLASSES WITH ME ALL THE TIME AND I WOULD JUST KEEP EM IN A POCKET AND WHIP EM OUT WHENEVER I WAS YEOU KNOW WORKING AT NEAR USING MY PHONE AT A LITTLE GREATER DISTANCE LIKE A TYPICAL COMPUTER DISTANCE I COULD STILL SEE THE COMPUTER FIND SO IT REALLY STARTED FOR LIKE KIND OF THAT CLOSE UP PHONE I WAS IT WAS I COULD GET INTO HEAR BUT NOT ALL THE WAY INTO HERE AND I'M YE AND THEN PRETTY SOON I WAS JUST TOTA LY ADDICTED AND SOW YOU KNOW THEN I HAD TO GO BY TEN PAIRS AND LEAVE THEM ONE BY THE BEDSIDE TA ALL YOU KNOW ONE AN THE CAR ONE IN THE COMPUTER BAG ONE ON EVERYOU JASK IE GAT YEH BECAUSE I LEAVE EM ANYWHERE AND FORGET THEN HAHE ATE LL YETAALLY SO I'M YET SO WEATHER USING THE READERS EXCELERATES THE PROGRETION OF DEPENDENCE ON THE READERS IS STILL ANOT YOU NOW IT STILL UP FOR DEBATE YOU A SOME STUDIES SAY MAYBE YAS SOME STUDIES SAY MAYBE NOW BUT CERTAINLY PSYCHOLOGICALLY WE GET ADDICTED TO GOOD EASY VISION AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO SQUINT AND YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT STRAINING YOUR MUSCLES AND ALL OF THE SUDDEN THE THE TEXT ON YOUR PHONE LOOKS CRISPER AGAIN A BOY THAT'S ADDICTIVE YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE GOOD VISION AND SO IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE GETTING DEPENDENT AND HOW MUCH OF THAT IS CHANGIN THE EYE MUSCLES AND HOW MUCH OF THAT IS JUST THE PSYCHOLOGY OF WANTING TO HAVE GOOD VISION I THINK PROBABLY THE JURY'S A LITTLE BIT OUT ON THAT POINT BUT POINT BEING YOU'RE TO EITHER EITHER WAY YOUR DEPENDENCE WILL GROW AND AS YOU CONTINUE TO AGE FORTIES FIFTIES UP UNTIL ABOUT SIXTY SIXTY FIVE THE ABILITY TO CHAPE THAT LENS GETS WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WEAKER AND SO YOU NEED TO MOVE FROM THE POINT FIVES TO THE ONE POINT AIS TO THE ONE POINT FIVES AND DEVELSHLOTTLE TO THE CWELL IN THANKFULLY NOT YOU EVENTUALLY MACKS OUT AT ABOUT PLUS TWO POINT FIVE OR PLUS THREE BECAUSE THAT'S THE AMOUNT OF EXTRA REFRACTIVE POWER THAT YOU NEED ID MAGNIFIERS TO TAKE THE EQUIVALENT OF YOUR INFINITY VIEWING AND BRING IT UP TO FOURTEEN INCHES TO READ IT NEAR BASICALLY YOU NEED A PLUS THREE AND THEN YOU DON'T NEED ANY LENS I MUSCLE ACTION WHATSOEVER SO YOU CIND A MAX OUT AROUND TWO POINT FIVES OR THREES SO BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE WILL HIT THE SOMEWHERE IN THEIR FORTIES THIS SORT OF LIKE CASHOM HAVING TROUBLE ON THE PHONE I THINK MOST PEOPLE ACTUALLY USE THAT THAT'S LIKE KIND OF THE FIRST TIME FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY'RE LIKE WIE I GUESS I SHOULD GO TO THE EYE OFF AS RIGHT SEE THE OPTOMETRIST OR MAYBE OPTHEMOLOGIST AND WHEN THEY GO IN THEY SHOULD BE GATTING THE STANDARD IN EITHER OF THOSE OFFICES WILL BE TO GIVE YOU A FULL SCREENING EXAMINE INCLUDING MAYBE IT'S THE PUFF TAST OR A BLUE LIGHT TAST OR A LITTLE PEN THAT THAT CAN CHECK YOUR EYE PRESSURE AND HAVING A LOOK INSIDE AND SEEING IF YOUR RATIN AN OBJECT NERVE LOOK HEALTHY S KIND OF SCREENING FOR ALL THE MAIN DISEASES AND SO AND THEY'LL TELL YOU AT THAT POINT PE YOU'LL LOOK REAHT IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR GLASSES AREN'T DOIN IT FOR YOU IN A YEAR OR THREE YEARS COME BACK OR THEY MIGHT SAY HAVE DETECTED SOMETHING AN WORRIED ABOUT YOU AND THEY'LL SET UP A ROUTINE FOR YOUR ON GOING I CARE ASSUMING THAT SOMEBODY DOESN'T HAVE YOU KNOW SOME FORM OF AMBLEOPIA OR THE NEED FOR SOME A REALLY ROBUST CORRECTIVE LENSES AND THEY ARE ALREADY USING READERS BUT' SAY A PLUS ONE OR SO HIUM PLUS ONE PLUSERMINUS POINT FIVE READER WOULD YOU RECOMMEND BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE AND BASTED ON OUR EXPERIENCE THAT PEOPLE STRIVE TO AVOID USING THEM FOR AS LONG AS THEY CAN BECAUSE IN SOME SENSE IF THAT'S THE RECOMMENDATION THEN THE RECOMMENDATION IS THAT PEOPLE CAN DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT THEIR SEEING A LITTLE LESS WELL OR A LOT LESS WELL THAN THEY POSSIBLY COULD SO I'M ASSUMING THAT PEOPLE CAN STILL DRIVE WELL PEOPLE CAN STILL READ BUT IT INVOLVES A A BIT MORN' EFFER ANOTHER WORDS ARE WE WEAKENING OUR EYES BY USING THESE THESE READERS I IREALIZE YOU SAID THAT THE DATE ARE A LITTLE BIT MIXED BUT AS LONG AS ONE CAN PERFORM THEIR REQUIRE DAILY ACTIVITIES WOULD WE BE BETTER OFF LENG THE USE OF READERS THERE'S TWO IMPORTANT ANSWERS TO THAT QUESTION ONE IS REGARDING THE LENS AND THE I MUSCLES THAT CONTROL THE LENS AND IT'S ENTIRELY PLAUSIBLE THAT'S WHAT I WA SAYINKIN O THE DATE'S MIXED ON BUT IT'S PLAUSIBLE THAT IF WE WERE JUST EXERCISE LIKE WORK A LITTLE HARDER CAN I NOT USE AS STRONG A READER AS WE WANT OR NOT USE THAT READER AS OFTEN AS WE MIGHT REALLY ENJOY AH ARE WE EXERCISING THOSE MUSCLES AND CON EXERCISING THE ABILITY TO TO TO STRATCH VERSES RELAX THE LENS AND CIN SLOW THE PROGRESSION FROM THE ONE POINO READER TO THE ONE POINT TWO FIVE READER TO THE ONE POINT FIVE READER ET CETERA RIGHT AND SO THAT THAT'S WHAT SAYING THE DATEAS MIXE BUT THERE'S A GOOD PRAMIS THAT MAYBE IF YOU'RE EXERCISING BUT LETME GIVE YOU THE ON ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S PROBABLY IDEAL TO GIVE YOUR RATINA AND YOUR BRAIN THE SHARPEST VISUAL SIGNALS YOU CAN SO WHY HAMSTRING YOU'RE RATINA AND YOUR BRAIN AND YOUR VISION AND YOUR ENJOYMENT AND ABILITY TO READ OR DO NEAR WORK BY CONSTANTLY UNDER CUTTING  THE READING GLASSES OR LEAVING THEM OUT OR YOU'RE NOT HELPING THE WHOLE BACK PARTIERS MAYBE YOURE MAYBE YOU'RE HELPING THE LNS BUT YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT HELPING YOUR RATINA AND BRAIN BY FEEDING IT BLURRY INFORMATION ALL OF THAT TIME SO I ACTUALLY THINK JUST GIVE IN USE THE READERS HAVE YOUR BENJOY YOUR BEST VISION ALL THE TIME AND IF THAT MEANS WEARING GLASSES AND BY THE WAY IF THAT MEANS THAT YOU'RE CAN TO HAVE MINE IS TWO GLASSES FOR VISION AND YOU'LL EVENTUALLY NEED MIND US TWO FIFTIES FOR DISTANC VISION OR IF YOU'RE GOINGTO NEED READERS ONE POINT FIVE READERS NOW AND IN A FEW YEARS TWO POINTO READERS O K SO YOU'LL GET THE NEXT READER IT'S IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY NOT A GOOD DEAL YOU CAN YOU CAN AND NO YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT HURTING YOU'RE PROBABLY HELPING AND IN THE MEANTIME IT'S AN ENORMOUS ENJOYMENT TO ACTUALLY HAVE GOOD VISION ALL THE TIME RIGHT SO SO I ACTUALLY COUNSIL PEOPLE JUST WHERE THE GLASSES THAT WORK BASS FOR YOU YOU KNOW YOU'RE ONLY MINIMALY CHANGING HOW YOUR PRESCRIPTIONS CAN A CHANGE OVER TIME VERY MINIMALLY SO JUST ENJOY YOU'RE BEST VISION EVEN IF IT'S USING READERS FOR CLOTHES OROR PRESCRIPTION GLASSES FOR FAR APPRECIATE THAT RECOMMENDATION I DO ENJOY YOU USING THE READERS AT NIGHT REALLY HELPS FOR ALL THE REASONS I MENTION BEFOR I'VE NOTICE THAT DRIVING AT NIGHT PRESENTS AN ENORMOUS STRAIN ON MY VISUAL SYSTEM AND I'VE NOICIS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS ARE THERE ANY I KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING ALLED STATIONARY NIGHT BLINDNESS I DON'T THINK I'M STATIONARY NIGHT BLIND UM I THINK THE MUTATION FOR STATIONARY MAT NIGHT BLINDNESS WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE COLLUSEA HORSE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THESE WERE HORSES THAT YOU COULD WALK UP TO VERY EASILY IN THEY WHEN YO VEN SEE YOU UNTIL YOU ARE RITE THERE SOME OE HEGIN TO CORRECT ME ON THIS IT'S THE INTER NET BUT T I THINK THAT THE MUTATION WAS IDENTIFIED UM ET CETERA I DON'T THING I'M STATIONARY NIGHT BLIND BUT I DO FIND THAT DRIVING AT NIGHT I GET VERY FATIGUED AND THEN I'L SOMETIMES EVEN WEAR MY PLUS ONE READERS WHEN I DRIVE AT NIGHT WHICH REMOVES THE FATIGUE EVEN THOUGH I 'M LOOKING MORE OR LESS AT A DISTANCE ARE THERE'S SOME CONDITIONS THAT MAY GIT HARD FOR PEOPLE TO SEE AT NIGHT FOR WHICH THEY WOULD WANT CORRECTIVE LENZES UM IN WHAT WHAT SORTS OF BIOLOGY UNDERLIES THAT ASSUMING THAT SOMEBODY IS NOT STTIONARY NIGHT BLIND OR COLLUSA I THINK IS THE NAME OF THE BREED HORSE YET THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION YOU KNOW WE FOR THE FOR THE OPTICAL DEFECTS IN OUR EYES MOST OR MANY OF WHICH CAN BE CORRECTED WITH JUST HAVING THE RIGHT PRESCRIPTION LENSES WE CAN GET AWAY WITH IT WITHOUT USING THOSE CORRECTIONS IN WRITER LIGHT AND SO DURING THE DAY TIME AM YOU KNOW YOU COULD BE SLIGHTLY BLURRY YOU KNOW IF I'VE A REAL BRIGHT LIGHT AAND A GOOD HIGH CONTRAST BOOK YOU KNOW WITH BLACK LETTERS ON THE WHITE PAGE I CAN GET AWAY WITH READING THAT WITHOUT MY READERS UNLIKE IF IT IF I'M AN DIM LIGHT THAN I FEEND THAT MIGHT BE KINDO WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IF YOU'RE READING AT NIGHT YOU ACTUALLY PREFER TO USE THE E READERS A LITTLE MORE EVEN AT NIGHT BECAUSE WE CAN MAKE UP FOR A LOD OF THAT BLUR IF WE JUST HAVE BRIGHT ENOUGH SIGNAL AND CONTRAST COMING INTO OUR EYES NSE YE SO WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING AT NIGHT AND NOTICING THIS THIS MIGHT BE REVEALING A LITTLE BIT OF A NEED FOR GLASSES NOW I'M NOT SUGGESTING THIS IS THE ANSWER BUT FAR MORE COMMON THAN HAVING CONGENITAL STATIONARY NIGHT BLINDNESS WOULD BE BEING WHAT'S CALLED A LATENT HYPER ROPE OK NOW WE TALKED ABOUT ALREADY HOW THE LENS INSIDE OUR EYE GOES FROM FOCUSSING AT DISTANCE TO THEN WE SQUEEZE THE MUSCLES THE LENDS ACTUALLY ROUNDS UP AND IT LOWS US TO FOCUS AT MEAR SOME PEOPLE'S OPTICAL SYSTEM OF THEIR EYE IS ACTUALLY WIRED OR DESIGNED OR SHOURT OVE SET UP IN LENGTH NOT FOR REGULAR DISTANCE WHICH WOULD BE ANYWHERE FROM ABOUT THREE FEET TO INFINITY BUT IT'S ACTUALLY DESIGNED IT'S ACTUALLY TUNED FOR BEING BEYOND INFINITY WHICH DOESN'T MAKE ANY ACTUAL SENSE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT IT BUT JUST THE OPTICS OF THE EYE AT THEIR BEST FOCUS ARE ACTUALLY FOCUSSING THE LIGHT BEHIND THE RATINA AND AND IF YOU'RE DOING THAT WHEN YOU'RE YOUNGER YOU'RE ACTUALLY USING SOME OF YOUR FOCUSSING POWER TO TO TO USE THOSE MUSCLES STRAIN THOSE MUSCLES RELAX THAT LENDS ROUND UP THAT LENDS AND HAVE YOURE VISION FOCESS FROM BEYOND INFINITY TO NORMAL DISTANCE LIKE DISTANCS VISION AND SO IF YOU'RE A LATE NYPEROPE YOU ARE CONSTANTLY US ING THOSE MUSCLES AND AGAIN IF YOU'RE TIRED IT'S THE END OF THE DAY YOUR MUSCLES ARE FEELING A LITTLE FATIGUED I YOUR LATENT HYPEROPIA OR BY THE WAY IF YOU'VE HAD A DRINKER TOO A ALCOHOL CAN DO THIS TOO YOUR LATENT HYPEROPIA CAN KIND OF KICK IN ESPECIALLY AS WERE AGE   WERE NOT AS GOOD IT REFOCUSSING THAT LANDS ANYWAY AND NOWOF SON YOUR VISION IS KIND OF REVERTING TO ITS NATURAL STATE WHICH IS SLIGHTLY OUT OF FOCUS AT DISTANCE BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY FOCUSED BEYOND INFINITY IF YOU WELL AND SO ALL THE SUN YOU PUT ON THAT PLUS ONE JUST FOR A LITTLE EXTRA BOOSTER KICK AND YOU'RE LIKE OH YA YO DISTANCE VISION IS CLEAN AND EASY NOW SO I'LL HAVE TO BRING YOU INTO THE CLINET TO REALLY BE SURE BUT YOU COULD BE EXHIBITING A LITTLE BIT OF THAT KIND OF LATE N HYPEROPIA I DEFFLY WANT THE I EXAMINE I WANT IT FROM YOU AND I'VE BEEN CALLED A LOT OF THINGS IN LIFE  AND WE CAN NOW LAT ADD PERHAPS LATENT HYPER OPIA A TO THAT ANOTHER PIECE HERE AND A AGAIN THIS DISCUSSION IS NOT DESIGNED TO BE AND I EXAM FOR ME BUT  I HAVE YET ANOTHER EXPERIENCE THAT I THINK ILLUSTRATES THE KEY IMPORTANCE OF BOTH CRITICAL PERIOD PLASTICITY AND THE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER NOT TO RELY ON CORRACT IFE LENSES AND THAT IS  FROM THE TIME I WAS PRETTY YOUNG I COULD MAKE MY SISTER LAUGH BY DEVIATING ONE EYE INWARD SO NOT CROSSING MY EYES BUT MOVING ONE EYE INWARD AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED WAS WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE IND STUDYING A LOT A LOT AND GETTING VERY FATIGUED I NOTICE THAT THIS EYESTART TO CND OF DRIFT IN A LITTLE BIT SO I WENT TO THE CAMPUS HELF CENTER AND THEY GAVE ME A PRESCRIPTION FOR A PRISM LENDS WHICH OF COURSE REDIRECTS THE IMAGE BUT THEN I NOTICE THAT THIS IBALL MOVING INWARD AND I GUESS FOR THOSE OF YOU WATCHING ON ON YOU TWO BEEN NOT JUST LISTENING  I CAN DO THIS UM BY JUST MOVING ONE EYE IN  AS I CAN MOVE THE LIAND TD AT SO FAIRLY PRONOUNCED IT START TO REALLY DRIFT IN AT AT A RELAXATION STATE AND I START SEEING DOUBLE AGAIN SO  WO THESE PRISM THIS ONE PRISM LEND LENDS IS A CRUTCH OF THE SORT THAT I REALLY DON'T WANT CRUSHED THE GLASSES LITTLE BROKE THEM AND N NEVER WENT BACK TO THEM IUM I HAVE VOLUNTARY CONTROL OVER IT BUT THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE WHERE THE CORRECTIVE LENDS CAN ACTUALLY CREATE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN I POSITION IF ONE RELIES ON IT SO WE THUS GETS BACK TO THIS ISSUE OF IUM WHEN SHOULD PEOPLE FORCE THEMSELVES TO WORK WITH THEIR NATURAL VISION MAYBE DO SOME MORE FAR VIEWING IM I SUPPOSE AND CERTAINLY GET OUTSIDE AND GET SUNLIGHT INTO THE SUNLIGHTFUL SPECTRUM LIGHT AS SUPPOSE TO RELYING ON CORRECTIVE LENSAS YE AND AND YOU'VE RAISED A VERY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION HERE AND THAT'S THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE MUSCLES THAT ARE INSIDE OUR EYE THAT WE USED TO RELAX AND REFOCUS THE LENS AND THE MUSCLES THAT ARE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE EYEBALL OF COURSE INSIDE OUR ORBIT BUT ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE EYEBALL THAT TURNED THE EYES AND IF EVERYTHING'S WORKING RIGHT KEEPS OUR EYES REALLY YOKED STRAIGHT AND WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER AT THIS POSSIBILITY THAT YOU MAY HAVE BEEN HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF INTERMITTENT ESATROPIA WERE INTERMIT IN TURNING IN OF THE EYES THAT THAN CULMINATED ON THAT DAY OF THAT DAY AT THE POOL WHEN YOU REALLY NOTICED AT IM AND YOU'RE ON GOING ABILITY TO ACTUALLY TURN ONE EYE AND COULD BE RELATED TO THAT I REMEMBER AS A KID STANDING IN FRONT OF THE MERROR AND NOT I COULDN'T GET MY EYES TO CROSS EVEN THOUR FRIENDS COULD DO IT AND YOU KNOW SO  KNOWIII WAS IN THE LOSING GROUP ON THAT ON THAT AND OF THE SAND I BECAME IN ONTHEM OLEG AND THEN IRECAME IN OFF THEM AL WHULT I MUST SAY IT IS VERY REASSURING THAT YOU HAVE EXCELLENT VISION YOUN I ALWAYS WORRY WHEN I GO TO A NEW DENTIST AND I LOOK UP AT THEM IN ONE MOMENT AND IF THEY ARE NOT WEARING A MASS AT THEIR TEETH OR NOT YOU KNOW PRISTINE I THINK WELL WHAT OM MI DOING HERE SO AT YOU KNOW AND ND OFF THEM ALL JUST WITH EXCELLENT VISION GIV BRINGS ME A E COMFORT THE CODDLERS CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE SHO RIGHT EXACTLY UM BUT YES SO SO WHEN TO CORRECT WHEN NO TO CORRECT WITH LENSES AND  I REALIZE HERE WE HAVEN'T TALKED AT ALL ABOUT CONTACTS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT EYEGLASSES YET LET'S COME TO CONTACTS IN A SACK IF YOU WANT BUT YET LET LET LEMME RETURN TO YOUR QUESTION THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROVIDING CORRECT OF LENSES THAT ALLOW YOU TO FOCUS FOR NEAR OR DISTANCE AH IN YOUR GLASSES SO THAT YOU CAN GO EASY ON THE INSIDE THE EYE EYE MUSCLE HAVING TO WORK SO HARD ANDALLOWT PEOPLE GET EYE STRAIN IN CERT OF A HEADACHES EVEN FROM THAT FROM NOT HAVING A ADEQUATE CORRECTION THAT THEY'RE WEARING THAT'S DIFFERENT ACTUALLY ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE CHULDREN OR AGAIN INTO THAT MAYBE EVEN INTO THE TEENS AND EVEN YOUNG ADULL YEARS FROM THE EYE MUSCLES ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE EYES WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO BE YOKING OUR EYES STRAIGHT AND SO THAT YOU HAVE THEM BOTH LOOKING AT THE SAME POINT IN SPACE AND AND THERE IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE A COMMON TREATMENT TO TRY TO UNDER CORRECT AND ASS PEOPLE TO EXERCISE AND NOT JUST GIVE A PRISM THAT'S AS HEY IF YOUR EYES IN SOMETIME WILL USE A PRISM SO THE LIGHT SORT OF LOOKS RIGHT TO YOU BUT RATHER UNDER CORRECT THAT AND SORT OF REALLY FORCE YOU TO EXERCISE TRYING TO YOKE YOUR TWO EYES STRAIGHTE TOGETHER AND SO THAT'S THAT'S IN CONTRAST AND THEYRE ACTUALLY I THINK MANY APTOMATRIS WHO OFTEN SPECIALIZE IN IN WHATER THE RIGHT GLASS IS TO GIVE IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT AH WHEREVER POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY DURING A DEVELOPMENT AS OUR BODIES ARE DEVELOPING AS WERE SORT OF GROWING IN OUR YOUNGER YEARS AH TAKE THE APPROACH OF INTENTIONALLY TRYING TO UNDER CORRECT NOT USE A PRISM OR NOT USE A FULL PRISM CORRECTION AH AND AM TO TO REALLY HELP SOMETIMES IT'S ALSO LIKE AN ACCOMMODATIVE REFLEX THAT YOUR EYES ARE JUST YOU'RE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME READING AND NEAR WHEN YOU READ IT NEAR YOUR EYES ACTUALLY NATURALLY TURN IN A LITTLE BIT TO FOCUS AT THAT NEAR SO THAT THEY CAN BE LOOKING AT THE SAME WORD ON THE PAG GE AND THAT CAN ALSO IF YOU'VE GOT KIND OF TOO MUCH MUSCLE DRIVE YOU CAN OVERSHOOT THAT AND SO SOMETIMES JUST USING NOT A PRISM BUT LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF A PLUS LENS IN KIDS JUST SO THE ENOUGH TO WORK QUITE SO HARD TO TURN THEIR EYES AND AND SORT OF EXERT OVER EXERCISE THOSE MUSCLES THESE ARE ALL GREAT EXAMPLES WE'RE GOING TO AND I CARE PROVIDE OR OFTEN FOR THESE KINDS OF ISSUES AND APTOMATRIST IS THE RIGHT FIRST PLACE TO START YOU'D LIKE TO SAY THAT EVERY OPTOMATRIST AND EVERY OPTHEMOLOGIST IS ALWAYS GOING TO GIVE THE EXACT RIGHT THING FOR FOR EACH KID OR YOUNG ADULT OR OLD OR ADULT TO DO AND AND WE WISH ALL MADICAL CARE PROVIDERS WERE WE'RE ALWAYS RIGHT ON TARGET AND A LOT OF TIMES IT'S A PERFECT SCIENCE BUT A LOT OF TIMES IT'S AN IMPERFECT SCIENCE AND SO IT COULD BE THAT AT LEAST WITH YOU KNOW WE'RE NOW TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THIRTY YEARS LATER BUT LIKE IT COULD BE THAT TO DAY THAT TWENTY YEAR OLD VERSION OF YOURSELF WOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO HAVING ONE EYE INTERMITTENTLY OCCASIONALLY TURNING IN LIKE THAT IS THERE ANY REAL VALUE TO UM NEAR FAR EXERCISES YOU KNOW SO CALL PENCIL PUSH UPS WERE A SMOOTH PURSUIT TRACKING TULK TO LITLEBIT ABOUT IT EFORE ON THE PODCASS BUT THOSE YOU SOME TIME AGO SO WHAT ER YOUR THOUGHTS ON ON THAT IS THERE ANY VALUE WHAT'SOVER ME THATE THEY REQUIRE LITTLE BIT TO WORK JUST LIKE ONE O THE JIM BUT O YOU TWENTY FIVE RUPTS A DAY OF NEAR FAR UM MESPUCIIS ONE IS TRANSITIONING FROM AGE THIRTY TO AGE FIFTY UM IS IT WORTH WHILE YAIS IT HARMFUL IN ANYWAY DEFINITELY NOT HARMFUL AND AGAIN I YOU KNOW WOULD IT SLOW DOWN OR SERT OF A A SLOW DOWN YOUR PROGRESSION TO PRESB OPIO OR NEEDING THOSE READING GLASS IS A COULD BE SOME PEOPLE ALSO DEVELOP IM SORT OF AYOU KOW A REAL FAILURE TO PROPERLY TURN THEIR EYES IN AND SO THEY ACTUALLY WOULD BANEFIT IF YOU'VE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH THAT INABILITY YOUR HAVENG DOUBLE VISION AT NEAR BUT NOT AT DISTANCE AM SO THAT KIND OF CONVERGENCE INSUFFICIENCY FOR EXAMPLE A THEN THEN PENCIL PUSHOPS OFF AND GET PESCRIBED AS A WAY TO TRY TO EXERCISE THOSE SKILLS IN YO I IN YOUR EYE MUSCLES I SHOULD INTERRUPT HERE AND JUST TELP HI FOR THOSE WBE THERE LISTENING NOT WATCHING THE PENCIL PUSH UP AN WE CAN PUT A A LINK TO IT IN THE SHOWN O CAPTIONS WIIS ESSENTIALLY TAKING A PEN OR PENCIL LOOKING AT IT AT UM AT ARMS DISTANCE AND THEN A SLOWLY MOVING IT TOWARD YOUR NOSE AND A DELIBERATELY WORKING HARD AND IT IS A BIT OF EFFORT TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON IT AT A CLOSE DISTANCE AT SOME POINT IT W'LL BECOME BLURRY BECAUSE I CAN'T CROSS MEYES ANY FURTHER UNLESS I BECOME A CYCLOPS AND THEN MOVING IT BACK OUT AGAIN AND DOING THAT FOR YOU' ATTEN TO TWENTY FIVE REPETITIONS MAY BE ONCE OR TWICE A DAY A FEU TIMES A WEEK  THAT'S WHAT THOSE ARE PENCIL PUSHOPS AYA SO I YOU'RE CERTAINLY NOCKUN OR HEARD ANYTHING THERE ARE OTHER SITUATIONS WHERE THOSE REALLY DO GET PRESCRIBED AND THERE'S STAFFANLY SOME GOOD CLINICAL TRIAL DATA SUGGESTING THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY HELP FOR EXAMPLE RECOVERY FROM CONCOSSION A LOT OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY ONE OF THE REALLY TELLING WAYS TO DIVE NOSE CONCOSSION AND THIS CAN BE CONCOSSION FROM SPORTS OR FALL OR YOU KNOW ANY ANY SOURCE OF CONCOSSION YOUR SMOOTH PURSUIT WHICH IS THE ABILITY LET SAY I'VE GOT A DOT MOVING AROUND IN A CIRCLE ON A SCREEN AND I'M FOLLOWING THAT DOT WITH MY EYES MY EYES SHOULD BE ABLE TO VERY SMOOTHLY FOLLOW THAT CIRCLE AROUND  REDOTING Y EYES LUCK ON ONE WATCHING A HOCKY GAME IS HAT LIKE YOUR I VANDRA LIKE THIES YOU DON'T JUST FOLLOWING A BALL YOU KNOW FOLLOWING ANY MOVEMENT WITH SMOOTH PURSUITS OF YOUR EYES AND AFTER CONCOSSION THAT ACTUALLY THOSE SYSTEMS IN OUR BRAIN THUS ARE OF REFLECTS IVE ABILITY TO PROPERLY FOLLOW THAT USE THAT VISUAL IMPUT TO TELL YOUR EYE MUSCLES EXACTLY WHERE TO MOVE GHAT'S DISRUPTED AND SO ALV AS ON YOUR SMOOTH PURSUIT STARTS TO LOOK CHOPY IT'S NOT SO SMOOTH ANY MORE AD IT'S ACTUALLY AWAIT A DIAGNOSE AND FOLLOW RECOVERY FROM CONCOSTION AND PART OF THE VISUAL REHAB SORT OF NERO REHAVE ONE OF THE APPROACHES BEING USED AND AND FURTHER STUDIED STILL IN RECOVERY FROM CONCAUTION IS ACTUALLY DOING THOSE KINDS OF EXERCISES LIKE PENCIL PUSHOPS OR BASICALLY WHAT YOU'VE DESCRIBED IS FOCUSING FROM FAR AWAY TO FOCUSING NEAR AND DOING THAT BACK AND FORTH AND USING THAT SORT OF LIKE HELP REGAIN AH THE ATIHTER CONTROL OF OUR EYE MOVEMENTS AND THAT EYEBRAIN CONNECTION SO IF TRAMATIC RAIN INJURY CAUSES DEFISITS IN SMOOTH PURSUIT EYE MOVEMENTS AND SOME OF THE RECOVERY PROTOCALS FOR DRAMATIC RAIN INJURY ARE TO HAVE PEOPLE DO SMOOTH PURSUIT PROTOCALS AND PENCIL PUSHOPS ARE THESE ALSO THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT ANY ONE CAN JUST DO IM WHENEVER POSSIBLE WE LIKE TO SHARE TOOLS FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF HEALTH ON THI PODCAST BUT OF COURSE WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE COWBOYING THIS STUFF IN A WAY THAT CAN BE DETRIMENTAL TO THEIR TO THEIR VISION SO IS IT OCCAY TO GET ON YUTUB AND FIND A SMOOTH PURSUIT AM A TOOL A WE CAN PUT A LINK TO THESE THERE THEI'R SEVERAL OF THEM AM AND PEOPLE SPEND A FEW MINUTES DOING THIS  YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT UNHEARD ANYTHING SO TOTALLY FIND TO DO IT AND SOME PEOPLE MAY NOTICE YOU KNOW LIKE THEY FEEL A LITTLE MORE VISUALLY ACTIVE IF THEY DO THESE KINDS OF EXERCISES AH I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD DO THEM AND NOT NOTICE SOMETHING IN THEIR DAILY LIFE WE ACTUALLY HAVE A MADE SO MUCH PROGRESS YOU KNOW IN RESEARCH IN THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE TAKE THE DISEASED OR DISFUNCTIONING OR AGING EY AND GET IT BACK TO HEALTHY AND NORMAL BUT THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER AREA OF SCIENCE THAT'S WE'RE REALLY JUST BARELY TOUCHING WE'VE ACTUALLY WE'VE ACTUALLY JUST OPEN A VISION PERFORMANCE ENNER TO REALLY GET AT NOT JUST HOW TO WE RE HAB THE SICK EYE BACK TO HEALTH BUT WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FUNCTIONING NORMALLY AND FUNCTIONING ABOVE NORMALLY FOR EXAMPLE ATHLETES WHEN THEY GET STUDIED FOR VISUAL VISION CHARACTERISTICS THEY HAVE FASKER VISUAL REFLEXES HIER VISUAL ACUITY AHOW MUCH OF THAT WAS YOU KNOW GENETTIC HOW MUCH OF THAT IS TRAINED WE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND CO WE TRAIN ALL OF ASSWITH YOU KNOW NORMAL VISION TO GET UP TO SUPRA NORMAL VISION THESE ARE LIKE GREAT IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT ARE REALLY RELEVANT TO YOU KNOW EVERY REGULAR PERSON OF COURSE YOU KNOTE PEOPLE DOING ESE SPORTS IN THE GAMING COMMUNITY IS AND ATHLETES IS PART OF WHAT WERE STUDYING IN THE VISION PERFORMANCE CENTRE BUT THESE ARE REALLY REALLY BIG OPPORTUNITIES TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO WE MOVE PEOPLE FROM NORMAL VISION TO SUPERNORMAL VISION AND THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT YOU CAN DO IT SO HERE HERE'S A GREAT EXAMPLE SOME ATHLETES TRAIN USING THESE SPECIAL GOGGLES THAT ACTUALLY USE ELECTRICAL SIGNALS IN THE GLASSES PART OF THE GOGGLES TO ACTUALLY BLACK OUT YOUR VISION ONE THIRTIETH OF EVERY SECOND TWO THIRTIETHS OF EVERY SECOND THREE THIRTIETHS OF EVERY SECOND NOW IMAGINE YOU AND I ARE PASSING E BASKETBALL BACK AND FORTH EXCEPT YOU'RE WEARING GOGGLES AND ALL OF US ON YOU'RE ONLY GETTING NINETY PER CENT OF THE DATA OF WHERE'S THAT BASKETBALL ON ITS WAY TO MY HANDS NOW YOU'RE ONLY GTTING EIGHTY PER CENT NOW YOUARLY ETTING SEVENTY PER CENT OF THAT VISUAL INFORMATION AND YOU ARE PRACTISING RIGHT YOU ARE GETTING GOOD AT CATCHING A BASKETBALL WHEN YOU ONLY HAVE A FRACTION OF THE VISUAL INFORMATION AND NOW I PUT YOU BACK ON THE BASKETBALL COURT WITHOUT THE GOGGLES W YOU MIGHT BE REALLY GOOD I'M PASKING THAT BASKETBALL AROUND AND CATCHING THAT BASKET BALL RIGHT AND SO THE IDEA THAT WE COULD TRAIN AND UNDER STAND THE BIOLOGY Y OF TRAINING TO GET THE EYES FROM NORMAL TO SUPERNORMAL PERFORMANCE I THING IT'S AT AMAZING AREAN ONE THAT WE'VE REALLY JUST STARTED TO DIG INTO THAT'S FANTASTIC SO THIS IS A A NEW PROGRAMME AT STAMFORD THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF OPTHEMOLOGY IS IT LINKT UP AT ALL WITH THE WOOSI PERFORMANCE INSTITUTE YAP ACTUALLY THERE'S BEEN A LONT OF FOCUS OVER THE YEARS I THINK IN HUMAN PERFORMANCE AND THERE'S ACTUALLY A NEW HUMAN PERFORMANCE AALLIANCE AND SANNER WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE LONG HAD REALLY RUN THROUGH TH DEPARTMENT OF OUR ORTH A PEDIX A HUMAN PERFORMANCE LABORATORY THAT'S REALLY YOU KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT JOINTHS AND MUSCLES AND STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING AND STRATCHING A TO LIR ON TO THAT NOW A REAL UNDERSTANDING OF HOW VISION IS OPERATING YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING LET'S GO BACK TO THE EXAMPLE OF CONCOUTION YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED VARSITY STUDENT ATHLETES AN ALL THE DIFFERENT SPORTS AT STAMFORD AND YOU MIGHT HAVE A STUDENT ATHLETE COME IN AND SAY YOU KNOW SOMETHING DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT I GOT A LITTLE HIT ON THE HEAD I FEEL LIKE MY VISION IS A LITTLE BIT MASTAB MAYBE I'VE GOT A MILD CONCAUTION YOU COULD IMAGINE DOING SOME OF THESE TASTS ON SOME OF THESE PERFORMANCE ATHLETES FOR EXAMPLE AND SAYING WELL GOSH YOU'LL YOU LOOK NORMAL BUT ACTUALLY THEY USED TO BE OPERATING AT A SUPERNORMAL RATE AND THIS IS A NOTICEABLE DECRAMENT FOR THEM AND SO JUST STARTING TO STUDY AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NORMA ON SUPERNORMAL HOW TO WE GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THOSE TWO HOW TO WE MEASURE THAT DIFFERENCE AND MAYBE ULTIMATELY HOW TO WE TRAIN INTO THAT DIFFERENCE I THINGS CAN BE EXCITING AND NOT JUST FOR ATHLETES YOU KNOW FOR FOR REGULAR PEOPLE YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT DRIVING AT NIGHT IS THERE A SOLUTION WHERE WE COULD TRAIN OUR EYES TO BE BETTER AT DRIVING AT NIGHT AND I DON'T KNOW MAYBE REDUCED THE UMBER OF ACCIDENTS THAT HAPPEN OUT IN THE WORLD SO WELL CERTAINLY THERE'S A PHYSICAL TRAINING PROTOCALS WHICH ARE REDEFINING WHAT A SIXTY YEAR OLD OR SEVENTY YER OLD COULD LOOK LIKE AND FEEL LIKE AND BE ABLE TO PERFORM LIKE I WHY NOT DO THE SAME FOR VISION SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING I'M SUPERNATURAL OR A GREEDY ABOUT DOING ANITHING THE THAT'S THE EXCITEMENT OF BIOLOGY AND NORPLASTICITY THAT YOU CAN EXTEND IT FORWARD AS SUPPOSE TO JUST TRYING TO WIRE UP CORRECTLY DURING DEVELOPMENT THIS IS A PERFECT TIME FOR ME TO ASK YOU A QUESTION THAT I'D LOVE A CLEAR ANSWER ON IF IT'S POSSIBLE IT'S NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE WHICH IS COULD YOU DEFINE TWENTY TWENTY VISION AND A FEW OF THE VARIANCE SO THAT ANY PERSON COULD UNDERSTAND IT SO WE THINK OF TWENTY TWENTY AS PERFECT VISION WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WHAT WOULD DEGRADED VISION LOOK LIKE WHATEVER THOSE NUMBERS ARE AND THEN WHAT WOULD ABOVE NORMAL SUPER NORMAL VISION LOOK LIKE AND IS IT TRUE THAT FIGTER PILOTS HAVE SUPERA NORMAL VISION YET THAT'S ANOTHER POPULATION LIKE LIKE LIKE MANY ATHLETES OF OF PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE SORT O BETTER THAN NORMAL VISION TWENTY TWENTY YOU KNOW WE'D DEFINE ALMOST EVERYTHING WE DO BASED ON YOU KNOW KIND OF A AVERAGE NOT SICK HUMAN BEING ADULTWHATEVER IT IS RIGHT AND SO TWENTY TWENTY VISION MEANS THAT YOU CAN READ THE SMALLEST LATTERS AT TWENTY FEET AWAY THAT THE AVERAGE HEALTHY PERSON CAN READ AT TWENTY FEET AWAY SO YOU CAN READ IT TWENTY WHAT THEY CAN READ AT TWENTY OKAI NOW IF YOU HAVE WORSE THAN TWENTY TWENTY VISION MAYBE OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE VISION TWENTY FORTY VISION MAYBYOU HAVE TWENTY TWO HUNDRED VISION WHICH ON THE EYE CHART AT THE OFFICE IS LIKE A BIG E AT THE VERY TOP IS TWENTY TWO HUNDRED VISION THAT MEANS YOU CAN READ AT TWENTY FEET WHAT A NORMAL PERSON COULD READ AT TWO HUNDRED FEET RIGHT SO YOU'VE GOT PRETTY LIMITED LOWER VISION WE CAN MEASURE DOWN TI LIKE TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED AT THAT POINT WE'RE GETTING INTO LIKE CASH CAN YOU COUNT HOW MANY FINGERS UM HOLDING UP YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF THING AND THEN ULTIMATELY AND MOTION CAN YOU EVEN TALL IFF MY HAND IS MOVING IN THIS SIDE OF YOUR VISION OR THIS SIDE YOUR VISION AND THEN ULTIMATELY AFTER THAT LIGHT PERCEPTION CAN YOU TELL IF THE ROOMLIGHTS ARE ONOR OFF RIGHT AND THAT'S KIND OF THE EDGE OF OF BEING ACTUALLY FULLY BLIND WE CALL LEGAL BLINDNESS IN HE UNITED STATES TYPICALLY TWENTY TWO HUNDRED OR WORSE AND IS IT TRUE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE LEGALLY BLIND THAT ARE OUT THEIRE DRIVING AS WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION I I HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT THAT IS UNFORTUNATE LY TIC CASE BUT IT SHOULD BE BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY ARE REALLY SEVERELY IMPAIRED N  AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY QUITE DANGEROUS SO SO SO THAT'S TWENTY TWENTY NOW IT GETS WORSE TWENTY FORTY TWENTY EIGHTY TWENTY HUNDRED CAN IT GET BETTER YET IT TURNS OUT THAT PEOPLE CAN BE SORT OF ON THE OTHER END OF THAT CURVE AND SO WE COULD HAVE ATHLETES AND FIGHTER PILOTS OR PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD LACIC SURGERY WHO ARE TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY TEN IF YOU'RE TWENTY TEN THAT MEANS YOU CAN SEE A TWENTY FEET WHAT THE AVERAGE PERSON NEEDS TO BE ONLY TEN FEET AWAY TO SEE RIGHT AND SO YOU'VE GOT BETTER THAN NORMAL VISION AND PEOPLE DO GET TO THAT THROUGH A VARIETY OF WAYS AND SO IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE BETTER THAN TWENTY TWENTY VISION DOES THE DEGREE OF VISUALACUITY CAS THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE DIFFERED DRAMATICALLY BETWEEN THE TWO EYES IN MOST HEALTHY PEOPLE NOW AM YOU DON'T REMEMBER WE TALKED ABOUT YOU'R BORN WITH SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY TWO HUNDRED VISION TAKES YOU A COUPLE YEARS AND ITCAN BE A LITTLE BIT AE AMATRE TWENTY TWO HUNDRED VISION YETHIS REMINDS ME  I'VE SEEN IMAGES OF WHAT BABIES CAN SEE YOUR PARENTS LOVE LOOKING AT THEIR CHILD IN THINKING OF THEIR CHILD IS LOOKING RIGHT BACK AT THEM MAN INDEED OFTEN THE CHILD IS LOOKING RIT BACK AT THEM AND YOUR FACE TO YOUR CHILDS ARE TO BREAK THIS TO YOU FOLKS IS INCREDIBLY BLURRY EVEN AT THAT CLOSE DISTANCE FOR ITPROBABLY THE FIRST SIXTO EIGHT MONTHS EVEN'S BEFORE YOU COME INTO SHARP RELIEF THEY'RE NOT SEEING THE FINE DETAILS OF YOUR FACE YASA SMILE BIG THAT'S RIGHTS MALREY  KEEP THOSE EYEBROWS DARK RIGHT AND KE COOING AT THEM THEY CAN HEAR PRETTY WELL ANOTHER YT THE OBJECTS OF NEWBORN BABIES ARE JUST DREADFULLY BAD BUT THEY NEED VISUALSNOW OTHER SPECIES NAT YENO HAWKS A RAPTERS OWLS THAT HUNT A VEK CAN NATURALLY HAVE TWENTY TAN TWENTY EIGHT VISION WRITES A MUCH BETTER VISION AND THAT'S JUST THEIR NORMAL VISION AS BESTAS HAS BEEN MEASURED SO SO THERE'S DEFINITELY THE POTENTIAL FOR US TO HAVE BETTER THAN TWENTY TWENTY VISION NOW ALL OF THIS WE CALL VISUAL ACUITY AND JUST TO BE CLEAR FOR EVERYONE THAT'S THE VISION IN THE VERY CENTRE OF YOUR VISION LIKE WHEN YOU'RE READING OR LOOKING THAT'S THE VERY CENTER OF YOUR VISION OUR VISION IS ACTUALLY DESCRIBED VARIABLY AS A HILL OF VISION THE PEAK IS IN THE CENTER THAT'S LET'S SAY TWENTY TWENTY IN MOST PEOPLEL RIGHT BUT IT'S IT'S NORMAL TO HAVE THAT SLOPE OFF AND OUR VISUAL ACUITY YOUR ABILITY TO READ THE EYE CHART ON THE EDGES OF YOUR VISION IF YOU CAN READ THE BIG E THAT'S PRETTY NORMAL WHY YOU WOULD BE TWENTY TWO HUNDRED OUT ON THE EDGES OF YOUR VISION AND WE WOULD FEEL LIKE YEP THAT'S PRETTY NORMAL AM SO SO OUR HIGHEST ACUITY VISIONS IN THE CENTER AND THAT'S A BIG PART OF WHY WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME USING THOSE EYEMOSSELS TO LOOK AROUND RIGHT WE GOT A WE GOT TO GET ALL ABOOFA HIACUITY VIEW OF WHAT'S SURROUND US A FILL IN FILL IN THE GAPS OF WHAT OUR WHAT OUR BRAIN IS IS INTERPRETING OUR PARIFERAL WORLD TO LOOK LIKE IT'S ALMOST LIKE WAY HAVE TWO VISUAL SYSTEMS WE HAVE A HIACUITY HIGH PIXLE DENSITY CAMERA IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN SURROUNDING THAT IS A PRETTY LOW RESOLUTION BUT VERY FAST DETECTIV CAMERA YES  YE YOU MENTION LACE IT BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT LAYSIC THAT WE TUCKLE OBIT ABOUT CONTACT LENSES IS THERE ANY DETRIMENT TO HAVING A PIECE OF GLASS OR A PIECE OF PLASTIC ON THE FRONT OF YOUR EYE ALL THE TIME AND THE REASON I ASK IS NOT BECAUSE I THINK WE SHOULD LIVE NECESSARILY EXACTLY LIKE OUR ANCESTORS BUT IT'S A PRETTY BAZAAR ADAPTATION TO PUT A LENS DIRECTLY ON TO THE FRONT OF THE EYE YEF TO IMAGINE THAT THE CELLS AND TISSHOSE THERE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO GETTING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF OXYGEN THER STOM TO GETIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF INTERACTION WITH THE ENVIRONMENT AND AND YOU ALSO NOW ADDING ANOTHER SURFACE THE WAY THAT THE TEARS ARE GOING TO INTERACT WITH THE IM YOU KNOW AT THE CORNY OF THE EYE OR PROBABLY CHANGE AND WHO KNOWS MAYBE IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY NEGATIVE DIFFERENCE AT ALL BUT YOU PUTTIN CONTACT LENDS ON THE FRONT OF THE EYES YOU KNOW BOUT AS CLOSE TO PUTTING A DEVICE ON YOUR BRAIN AS I CAN THINK OF EXCEPT FOR MAY BE THE COOKLYR A IMPLANT E E IT'S A GREAT QUESTION NOW FIRST OF ALL IM I WANT TA DISTINGUISH A THERE ARE A FEW REALLY MEDICAL USES FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF CONTACT LENZAS LIKE SCLAREL CONTACT LENZAS FOR PEOPLE HAVE CERTAIN DISEASES THERE OTHER KINDS BUT I THINK WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS JUST KIND OF THE RUN OF THE MILL I WANT TO GET MY PRESCRIPTION TAKEN CARE OF BUT INSTEAD OF WEARING GLASSES I 'M GOING TO WEAR CONTACTS CONTACTS EVEN THE NEWEST GENERATION CONTACTS YES THEY SORT OF ACHANGE THE TIR DYNAMICS ON THE SURFACE OF YOUR EYE THEY IM THEY DECREASE THE OXYGEN YOU KNOW DIFFUSION THAT'S JUST SORT OF OUT IN THE AIR ON TO THE SURFACE OF OUR EYE ON TO THE CELLS THAT ARE ON THE SURFACE OF OUR EYE BUT MOST OF US ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE YOUNGER HAVE ENOUGH TEERFILM RESERVE ENOUGH OXYGEN RESERVE THAT WE CAN EASILY TOLERATE THESE POLUMNER JALL SOFT CONTACT LENS IS AND AND WEAR THEM HAPPILY THE ADVANTAGE OF CONTACT LENSES OVER GLASSES PURELY FROM THE PERSPACTIVE OF CORRECTING YOUR VISION IS THAT THERE'S DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF OF OF OF THE SHAPE OF YOUR EYE THAT NEED TO BE CORRECTED IF YOU NEED CORRECTIVE LENSES AND SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOUARE THE BASKETBALL SHAPE OF YOUR EYE IS A LITTLE TOO STEEP OR A LITTLE TOO SHALLOW THAT'S WHAT THE STANDARD GLASSES CORRECT YOU MAY HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT YOU HAVE SOMETHING CALLED A STIGMATISM THAT'S WHERE INSTEAD OF HAVING A BASKETBALL SHAPED EYE YOU HAVE A SLIGHTLY FOOTBALL SHAPED EYES NOT ROUND IN THE SAME DIMENSIONS ON BOTH AXES AND AGAIN GLASSES CAN CORRECT THAT BUT THEN THERE'S HIGHER ORDER ABERRATIONS IN OUR CORNY IS IN THE CLEAR WINDOW IN THE FRONT OF O OUR EYES OR OR TO SOME DEGREE IN THE LENS INSIDE THE EYE THAT ARE THAT ARE FOCUSING THE LIGHT THAT THE GLASSES PRESCRIPTION CAN'T CORRECT BUT IF YOU HAVE A NICE SMOOTH CONTCT LENS ON THE FRONT IT CAN CORRECT SO A LOT OF PEOPLE WO WEAR GLASSES AND CONTACTS WILL REPORT THAT THEY HAVE A MUCH HIGHER QUALITY OF VISION WITH THEIR CONTACT LENS CORRECTION THAN WITH THEIR GLASSES CORRECTION AND AGAIN IN SERVICE OF INJOYING THE BEST VISION THAT YOU CAN ENJOY IN YOUR DAILY LIFE THAT'S AN UPSIDE TO SEEING IF CONTACT COULD WORK FOR YOU NOW THERE'S ANOTHER ELEMENT THOUGH AND THAT'S LIKE GAUSHES THER ARE RISK OF CONTACT LENSES AND ESPECIALLY AS WE AGE AM WE HAVE LESS TEARFILM RESERVES OR CONTACT MAY BECOME LESS TOLERABLE AS WE AGE AND THE OTHER THING AS BEING REALLY GOOD ABOUT THE CLEANING BECAUSE YOU KOW THE CONTACT CAN TRACT BACTERIA OR FUNGUS AND IF YOU GET A CORNIAL INFACTION FROM A CONTACT LENS IT ACTUALLY CAN BE QUITE DEVASTATING TO YOUR CORNIA EVEN IF YOU SUCCESSFULLY TREAT THE NFACTION YOU CAN BE LEFT WITH SOME CORNEAL SCARRING THANKFULLY THIS HAPPENS VERY RARELY BUT WHEN IT DOES HAPPEN IT CAN BE QUITE DIFFICULT ON YOU KNOW ON THE PERSON THEREAFTER A SORT OF SUFFER THROUGH HAVING MAYBE A SCAR FROM THAT INFACTION ON THE SURFACE OF THEIR CORNEA THAT THEY THAT LEADS TO SOME BLURRING VISION FOR EXAMPLEL SO WE ALWAYS RECOMMEND THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO WEAR CONTACTS THAT YOU BE REALLY ATTENTIVE TO WHETHER YOUR TOLERATING THEM WELL AND THEN ALSO TO BE REALLY ATTENTIVE TO THE RECOMMENDED USE AND CLEANING OF THE CONTACT LENZES I ACTUALLY RECOMMEND THAT EVEN THOUGH THE'RE A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE TO AFFORD THAT PEOPLE SHOULD ALMOST ALWAYS BE JUST USING THE DAILY CONTACT LENZES THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO CLEANER USE FOR YOU KNOW TOO WEEKS OR FOR WEEK PERIOD SO THESE ARE DISPOSABLE CONTACT DAILY DISPOSABLE AND I HATE TO THINK OF YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW FILLING OUR OCEANS OR WHAT HAVE YOU WITH THEM OR MORE MORE POLUM OR PLASTIC BUT AT LEAST THE CONTACT LENSE OR SMALL AND IT'S MUCH SAFER FOR YOUR EYE TO USE A DAILY DISPOSABLE THAN TO USE A TOO WEEK OR A FOR WEEK AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CLEANING THE OTHER THING TO BE REALLY RESPONSIBLE ABOUT IS SLEEPING IN THEM OVERNIGHT BECAUSE OVERNIGHT WHEN YOUR EYELIDS ARE CLOSES OF COURSE NOW YOU'RE ETTING EVEN LESS OXYGEN TO THE SURFACE OF YOUR  ACTUALLY MOST BACTERIA ESPECIALLY MANY OF THE INFECTIOUS PACTERIA TOO OUR BODIES AND TO THE SURFACE OF OUR EYE ORE ACTUALLY BACTERIA THAT DON'T REALLY LIKE OXYGEN AND SO WE'VE GOT A LOW RISK OF GETTING BACTERIAL INFECTIONS ON THE SURFACE OF OUR EYE BUT IF WE USE CONTACTS TOO MUCH DON'T CLEAN THEM OR SLEEP IN THEM OVER NIGHT WHEN OUR EYELIDS ARE CLOSENG NOTHERS EVEN LESS OXYGEN KIND OF HELPING KEEP THE SURFACE MORE MORE CLEAN IF YOU WILL AH THAT INCREASES THE RISK ALOT SO BEING REALLY GOOD WITH THE RECOMMENDED USE IN CLEANING OF THE CONTACTS IS CRITICAL CONSIDERING DAILY USE CONTACT YOU DON'T HAVE TO AND LOOK MOST CONTACTS ARE GIN TO BE THE TOO WEAK OR FORE WEEK KIND WER PUT HIM IN THE CLEANING SOLUTION O FOR NIGHT EACH TIME GIVE HEM A GOOD RINTS AND PUT HIM BACK IN THE NEXT DAY AND I GET MOST PEOPLE NINETY NINE POINT NINE NINE SOME PER CENT OF PEOPERGONA DO JUST FIND WITH THAT FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AND NEVER GET INTO TROUBLE AS WE AGE THEY'RE GOING TO BECOME LESS TOLERABLE PEOPE AS I USED TO WEAR MY CONTACT FOR TWELVE HOURS NOW MY EYES FALL REALLY DRY AFTER SIX OR EIGHT OR TEN HOURS MAYBE SOME YEARS AFTER THAT THER SEKASHA CA BEARELY USE IT FOR FOUR HOURS I ONLY USE THEM WHEN I GO OUT ON A SATURDAY NIGHT AH AND AND THAT'S O CAT YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU CAN BACK OFF AS YOU NEED TO BACK OFF BUT IN THE MEANTIME IF HIT HELPS YOU ESPECIALLY IN THE YOUNGER DECADES IT HELPS YOUR REALLY ENJOY AH YOUR BEST VISION GREAT WHAT ABOUT U V PROTECTION IN EYE GLASS LENSES AND OUR CONTACTS AM I'VE DEALT WITH MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT BLUE LIGHTS I AM NOT SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVES THAT ALL BLUE LIGHT IS TERRIBLE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO AVOID BRIGHT LIGHTS OF ANY WAV EF LENGTH LATE AT NIGHT IF YOU WANT YOUR MELATONEAN PRODUCTION TO BE NORMAL WHEN YOU WANT TO SLEEP WELL DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE WEARING BLUE BLOCKERS OR NOT IF YOU'RE JUST UNDER BLASTINGLY BRIGHT LIGHTS IT'S IN A SUPPRESS YOUR MELATONEAN AND YET SOME PEOPLE ENJOY BLUE BLOCKERS FOR THAT REASON NOW DAYS A LOT OF PEOPLE WEAR BLUE BLOCKER GLASSES OR BLUE BLOCKING LENSES WERE CONTACTS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIREDA THINKING THAT BLUE LIGHT IS BAD FOR OUR EYES DURING THE DAY I HAPPEN TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE IDEA THAT WE WANT AS MUCH BRIGHT LIGHT AS WE SAFELY CAN TOLERATE DURING THE DAY IDEALLY FROM SUNLIGHT IN ORDER TO SET OUR CIRCATIAN RHYTHM AND YET A LOT OF EYE GLASSES AND A LOT OF CONTACT LENS IS OUT THERE HAVE U V A ANDOR U V B BLOCKING FEATURES TO THEM SO WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS UNLESS IT IM PERFECTLY HAPPEN TO BE WRONG AND REVISE MY MY STANDS ON THIS  NOW WHAT WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS U V A B BLOCKING A IT'S A GIT'S IT'S IT'S REALLY IMPORTANTO DISTINGUISH THAT YOU V LY ON THE LIGHT SPECTRUM IS RIGHT NEXT TO BLUE LIGHT RED LIGHTS ON THE OTHER AND OF COURSE INFER REDE IS BEYOND THAT AND OUR EYES OTHER ANIMALS CAN SEE THESE BUT OUR EYES CAN'T SEE INFER RED THAT'S WHY WE CALL IT BEYOND RED AND WE CAN'T SEE ULTRAVIOLET ANCS WE CALL IT BEYOND VIOLET U V LIHT IS RIGHT NEXT TO BLUE LIGHT U V LIGHT IS KNOWN TO HAVE A LOT OF ADVERSE EFFACTS IT'S NOT REALLY GOOD FOR OUR SKIN AND THEREFORE YOU KNOW WE REALLY ONT TO AVOID SUNBURN AND COND O U V DAA YOU KNOW EXPOSURE AND DAMAGE ON OUR SKIN SIMILARLY IT'S NOT REALLY GOOD ON OUR EYES AND IT EFFACTS BOTH THE OCULAR SURFACE A LITTLE BET AND TERMS OF LIKE COND OF HOW DRY OR IRRITABLE YOUR EYES MIGHT FEEL FOR SOME PEOPLE AND CERTAINLY OVER THE LONG TERM U V LIGHT WILL ACCELARATE THE FORMATION OF CATARACT WHICH IS A BLURRING OF AN OXIDATE OF BLURRING OF THE LENS INSIDE THE EYE PROFOUND YOU V LIGHT CAN BE DAMAGING TO THE RATIN IF YOU'RE GTTING WAY TOO MUCH ON THE INSIDE A SO SO BLOCKING YOU VE LIGHT I BELIEVE IS JUST ABSOLUTELY STANDARD IN EVERY PAIR OF EYE GLASSIS AND I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY HOW MUCH TO WHAT DEGREE THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF CONTACT LENDS IS OSS O FILTER AT LEAST U V LIGHT NOW BLUE BLOCKERS BLUE BLOCKING GLASSES IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT AND AS I SAY LIKE I THINK ALMOST ALL GLASSES BECAUSE THE PLASTICS ALMOST ALL GLASSES ARE NOT MADE OF GLASS ANY MORE THE'RE MADE OF PLASTICS A BUT I THINK ALMOST ALL OF THEM NOW FILTER THE U V LIGHT WHICH AGAIN IS LIKT PROBABLY THE SAFE MOVE FOR OUR EYES AND PERIOCULAR ENVIRONMENT AROUND THE EYE ENVIRONMENT A SO A BLUE BLOCKERS IN OW THAT'S BEEN A HUGE FAT AND I'LL TELL YOU THE LAST THREE YEARS THROUGH THE PANDAMIC EVERYBODY GETTING ON THEIR COMPUTER OURS IN FRONT OF ZU MEETINGS WHERE WE USED TO WALK FOR BUILDING TO BUILDING FOR A MEETING THINGS LIKE THAT A I YOU KNOW I REMEMBER YOU KNOW LIKE THIS SORT OF BIG UPTICK IN THESE KINDS OF QUESTIONS AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THERE'S ANY DATA THAT BLOCKING BLUE IS HELPFUL IN ANY WAY AND AS YOU SAY IT MAY ACTUALLY PLAY INTO SART OF SIR CADIAN INTRAINMENT OF OURE NATURAL DAILY RHYTHM SO SO I THINK GLOCKING U VS A GOOD IDEA AND I THINK IT'S PRETTY STANDARD IYOU KOW THEY MAKE GLASSES BY THE WAY THAT ACTUALLY REACT TO YU V LIGHT THEY'RE CALLED TRANSITIONS THERE MAYBE A FEW DIFFERENT BRANDS I DON'T KNOW ABUT BUT YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE SUNGLASSES THAT ARE CLEAR EXCEPT THEN THEY TURN DARK IF YOU'RE OUT IN THE SUNLIGHT AND IT'S NOT JUST ANY SUNLIGHT IT'S ACTUALLY THE U V A WAVELANKS THAT THAT CAUSE THE CHEMICAL REACTION IN THE GLASS IS TO TURN FROM FROM CLEAR SEATHROUGH TO TO SUNGLASS BLOCKED GLASSES AND I'M YOU MAY NOTICE IF YOU IF ANY OF YOU OUT THERE ARE USING THESE KINDS OF GLASSES THAT THEY DON'T WORK IN THE CAR YOU'LL WEAR THEM IN THE CAR AND THEY WON'T GO TO SUNGLASSES EVEN THOUGH ATS SUNNY OUT AND AGAIN THAT'S BECAUSE ALL STANDARD CAR GLASS ALSO FILTERS U V THAT'S WHY IF YOU'RE RIDING AROUND IN THE CARN AT'S SUNNY OUT YOU'VE GOT YOUR HAND YOU KNOW UP NEXT TO THE WINDOW A WEARING A TEA SHIRT YOU NEVER GET A SUNBURN THROUGH THE CAR WINDOW ANY MORE BECAUSE ALL OUR CAR GLASS IS ALSO FILTERING U V LIGHT FOR US SO SOM THAT'S A VERY INFORMATIVE ANSWER AND BEFORE WE STARTED RECORDING YOU NI WERE DISCUSSING THIS PRACTICE OF MORNING SUNLIGHT VIEWING WHICH GAN A HIGHLY RECOMMEND OVER AND OVER AND YOU POINTED OUT THAT LOW SOLAR ANGLE SUNLIGHT SO SUNLIGHTED LOW IN THE SKY VIEWED FOR THEY BE TEN MINUTES A MORNING AND AGAIN NOT FORCING ONESELF TO LOOK AT IT AND STARE BUT BLINKING AS NEEDED IS NOT GOING TO CAUSES EXTENSIVE U V DAMAGE TO THE EYES IT'S REALLY THE WHEN THE SUN IS DIRECTLY OVERHEAD  THAT WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF U V WHICH RAISES THIS OTHER QUESTION WHICH IS FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T WEAR CORRECTIVE LENSES AND THEREFORE ARE NOT BLOCKING YOU V LIGHT TO THE EYES  WHAT SHOULD THEY DO ARE THEY IN TROUBLE SHOULD THEY BE WEARING A BRIN MED HAT BRIM TAT'S A GREAT IDEA THAT I'LL GET A RID OF A LOT OF THE DIRECT LIGHT INTO THE EYE OF COURSEYOU STILL AV REFLECTED LIGHT OFF OF SURFACE IS AND THAT THAT CAN INCLUDE YU V LIGHT OF COURSE AH YOU KNOW WEARING SUN GLASSES OUTSIDE EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE CORRECTIVE LINESES YOU KNOW IT'S MADE MAY AS TO BE MORE COMFORTABLE TO WEAR SUN GLASSIS OUTSIDE AH SO SO THESE ARE ALL FINE YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S PROBABLY NOT MAKING A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE HEALTH OF YOUR EYE WHETHER YOU'VE SPENT THE LASS FIFTY YEARS WEARING SUN GLASSES REALLY DOGMATICALLY FOR YOUR OUTDOOR TIME OR NOT AH YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE GOING TO DEVELOP LEST JUST SAY AGE RELATED CATARACTS INSIDE YOUR EYES WHICH WELL ALL GET CAT IF WE ALL LIVE TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY WE ALL GET CATARACTS YOU KNOW ITS IT'S GOING TO HAP AN SOME PEOPLE YOUNGER OR SOME PEOPLE OLD OR MAYBE IF YOU WERE REALLY DOGMATIC ABOUT WEARING YOUR YUV BLOCK IN SUN GLASSES MAYBE YOU'D GET YOUR YOUR CATARACTS AT SEVENTY FIVE YEARS OLD INSTEAD OF SEVENTY TWO YEARS OLD IT MAY NOT BE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THAT REGARD AH SO AGAIN NOT SOMETHING TO BE SUPERSTRASTS I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S MORE QUESTION OF JUST WHAT ARE YOU COMFORTABLE AN A AND THEN CERTAINLY I WELL SAY THE DUT THE OTHER ADVANTAGE OF A WIDE BRINNE HAT IS IT'S KEEPING SUN OFF OF YOUR FACE AND THESE ARE THE YOU KNOW SOME OF THE ESPECIALLY THE UPTURNED PORTIONS OF YOUR FACE LIKE THE CHEEKS AN THE NOSE THESE ARE THE SOME OF THE MOST COMMON PLACES TO GET SOME OF THE SKIN CANCERS THAT YOU CAN GET OVER A LIFETIME OF SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE AH SO YOU KOW THE WIDE BRIN HAP IS IT'S HELPING YOU FOR THAT AS WELL CAN'T HELP AT ASK ABOUT COMFORT AT VERYING LEVELS OF BRIGHTNESS I'M THE PERSON THAT WHEN SITTING IN A CAFE OR SOMETHING IN ON A BRIGHT DAY I CAN BE DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM SOMEBODY LIKE YOU WHO SEEMS TO BE PERFECTLY FINE WITHOUT SON GLASSES AND MAYBE MORE SHADED UNDER AN UMBRELLA OR SOMETHING THAT SORT AND I'M SQUINTING LIKE CRAZY IS ITNORMAL FOR THERE TO BE A PRETTY WIDE VARIATION AND SENSITIVITY TO LIGHT AND DOES THIS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE LIGHTNESS OR DARKNESS OF THE EYES YOU HAVE BROWN EYES I HAVE GREEN EYES BUT IS THERE ANY REAL CORELATION THERE YE YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD QUESTION I DON'T KO IF IT'S BEEN FORMELLY STUDY BUT I WILL TELL YOU LIKE I HAVE THE SAME IMPRESSION YOU DO WHICH IS THAT IF YOU HAVE AH THE BLUE EYES AR LIGHT COLORED EYES THAT YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE MORE SENSITIVITY WE KNOW THAT THERE'S DIFFERENCES IN THE IRIS MUSCLES THAT CONSTRICT AND DILATE IN RESPONSE TO LIGHT A FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU GO INTO YOUR EYE CARE PROVIDOR ANDTHEY'REGING TO DO A DILATED EXAMINE THEY PUT THE EYE DROPS IN YOUR EYE THAT DILATE THE EYES THEY SORT OF CHANGE THE THA THE NERVE IMPULSES ON TO THE IRIS MUSCLES OF THE IRIS DILATES AND OU GET THOSE BIG BIG OPEN EYES AM PEOPLE WITH BLUE EYES WE ABSOLUTLIY A BLUE OR HAZEL OR LIGHT COLORED EYES H YOU PUT THAT EYEDROP TO DILATE THEIR EYES IT'S GOING TO LASS FOUR SIX EIGHT HOURS WHERES IN A BROWN EYED PERSON OFTEN THE DILATION ONLY LAST ONE TWO FOUR HOURS SO THERE'S CLEARLY BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCEIS BETWEEN THE IRISES AND THEIR MUSCLES AND MAYBE THE NERVES THAT FEED THOSE MUSCLES AH BETWEEN LIGHT EYED PEOPLE AND AN DARKER EYED PEOPILE AAND THAT MAY ALSO THEREFORE RELATE TO THIS DIFFERENTIAL SENSITIVITY THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE OU KNOUGH YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO CAN STRICT YOUR EYES AND THE BRIGHT LIGHT AS EFFECTIVELY YOU'REGOINGTO FIND THAT BRIGHT LIGHT MORE A FRUSTRATING MORE ANNOYING AH YOU KNOW EVEN PAINFUL PEOPLE WILL FEEL LIKE THEIR EYES ARE CRAMPING ALMOST A AS THEY TRY TO GET THAT THOSE EYE MUSCLES TO ACTIVEAT TO BRING DOWN THE PUPILE AND BLOCK SOME OF THAT EXCESS LIGHT FROM GETTING IN INTERESTING IT'S GO UT TOLASIC WHAT IS LIC AND SHOULD I GET LASIGISERGERY DOES IT DOES EVERYONE NEED LACE IT CAN HELP IF IT CAN IT MAKE US YOU N A SUPERPHYSIOLOGICAL THEU NON'TCAN IT MAKE ME A TWENTY TEN YOU KNOW OFTEN IT CAN I'LL JUST SAY THAT OU KNA RIGHT UP FRONT IT IS AMAZING PEOPLE WILL COME OUT OF WAY SIC SURGERY AH A BETTER THAN TWENTY TWENTY UT THE CORNEA WE TALKED ABOUT FOR THAT'S THE CLEAR WINDOW ON THE FRONT OF YOUR EYE ALL THE LIGHT AS TO GET THROUGH THERE AND WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE ALREADY LIKE IF YOUR CORNY IS MISSHAPEN IF THE BASKETBALL SHAPE OF IT IS TO TO SHALLOW OR TO STEEPE THEN YOU'RE GOIN TO NEED GLASSES TO SEE AT DISTANCE AND ALSO IT NEAR IF IT'S TOO FOOTBALL INSTEAD OF BASKET BALL THAN IT'S GOING TO BE WHAT WE CALL A STIGMATISM AND AND THEN YOU CAN'T AT YOU NEED A CORRECTION FOR THAT INSTEAD OF CORRECTING WITH GLASSES THAT SORT OF HELP SHAPE THE LIGHT SO IT CAN GO THROUGH YOU ARE SLIGHTLY OFF SHAPE CORNEA INSTEAD OF WEARING CONTACT LENSES WHICH ALSO SHAPE THE LIGHT JUST AS IT'S ENTERING YOUR CORNYA RIGHT ON THE SURFACE OF THE EYE YOU CAN JUST RESHAPE THE CORNEA AND THE WAY LASIC DOES THAT THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF LAYSEC BUT THE BASICALLY THE WAY THE LASIC DOES THAT IS IT ACTUALLY A BLATES OR A GETS RID OF A LITTLE RING OR RIM OF THAT CORNEAL TISSIO SO THAT FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WERE A LITTLE SHALLOW AND YOU GOT RID OF A LITTLE BIT OF THAT TISSUE AROUND THE EDGE WITH THE LAZER THE LAZZE LASIC YOU KNOW STARTS WITH THE WORD LAZER IF YOU GOT RID OF THAT EDGE TISSUE THEN YOUR SORT OF MAKING IT A LITTLE MORE BASKETBALL SHAPED RIGHT OR IF YOU WERE TOO STEEPE ON YOUR CORNEA AND YOU USE THE LAZER TO KIND OF SHAVE OFF A LITTLE BIT OF THE THE TIP OF THAT BASKET BALL RIGHT THEN YOU'RE FLATTENING IT OUT FLATTENING OUT THE CORNI SO IT'S THAT KIND OF RESHAPING AND THE TECHNOLOGY HAS COME SO FAR THAT THE LASIC PROCEDURES CAN ACTUALLY CORRECT NOT JUST THE REGULAR ABERRATIONS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BUT ALSO SOME OF THESE HIGHER ORDER ABERRATIONS AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT MONOCHERS FOR THIS KIND OF LASIC IT'S ALL I THINK BELCOME FAIRLY STANDARD BUT WAVE FRONT GUIDED WHERE IT'S ACTUALLY USING LIGHT WAVES TO MEASURE WITH A VERY EXACT LOCALIZATION EXACT LY HOW MUCH AND WEARED O LAZER FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL EYE TO MAKE THAT CORNYA PAST THE LIGHT AS IDEALLY AS POSSIBLE NOW ONE OR A FEW PERSENIPATIENTS WILL ACTUALLY HAVE A DRY Y PROBLEM SO AFTER LAYSIC AS THOUG IT DOES INTERFERE A LITTLE BIT WITH THOSE CORNEAL NERVES FOR EXAMPLE AND I AND I DO THINK THAT IF YOU'RE A PERSON WHO ALREADY HAS DRY EYE HOPEFULLY IF YOU'RE ASKING YOUR ISURGEON ABOUT LAYSIC HOPEFULLY YOU'R BEING COUNCIL THAT IF YOU HAVE DRY EYE THIS MIGHT NOT BE A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU JUST LIKE CONTACTS MIGHT NOT BE A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF DRY EYE A BUT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE SPECIAL LOT OF YOUNGER PEOPLE IT'S QUITE COMMON I I I THINK THE STICTISIC SUGGEST MAYBE FIFTEEN OR TWENTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM LAYSIC YOU KNOW WHWHOWOULD WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE WEARING GLASSES MAY GET LAYSIC AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIFE AND AM YOU KNOW I USED TO JOKE YOU KNOW LASIC IT COST MORE MONEY THAN A PAIR OF GLASSES BUT IT DOESN'T COST MORE MONEY THAN TEN PAIRS OF PRESCRIPTION GLASSES OVER THE COURSE OF A DECATE OR TWO YOU KNOW AND SO I USED TO JOKE THAT GASHIF A IF EVERY ONE HAD TO HAVE LAZER EYE SURGERY FOR THEIR BEST VISION AND SOME ONE CAME ALONG AND SAID HEY I'VE GOT AN INVENTION YOT DON'T HAVE TO HAVE LAZER EYE SURGERY ANY MORE IT REST ON THE EARS AND THE BRIDGE OF YOUR NOSE I CALL THEM GLASSES COULD THEY HAVE SOLD THOSE FOR A THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS OF PAIR I DON'T KNOW MAY BE BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S KIND OF A CULTURAL ELEMENT OF SAYING YOU KNOW LIKE I DON'T WANT TO WHERE GLASSIS AND I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO WALK AROUND WITHOUT RELYING ON GLASSES OR CONTACTS OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE VERY ATHLATIC OR SPENDING A LOT OF THEIR TIME DOING ATHLETICS THEY MAY BE QUITE IRRITATED TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH GLASSES OR CONTACTS PEOPLE WHO AVE VERY SEVERE PRESCRIPTIONS I MEAN IF YOU WAKE UP AND YOU CAN'T EVEN REALLY YOU KNOW YOU'RE FUMBLING FOR YOUR GLASSES ON THE BEDSIDE TABLE BECAUSE YOU HAVE SUCH A SCRANT STRONG PA PRESCRIPTION YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE WHAT IT SAYS ON THE ALARM CL OCK NEXTS TO THE BAD YOU KNOW THESE ARE ALL GROUPS OF PATIENTS WHO LIKE REALLY CHANGE THEIR DAILY LIVES BY GETTING OUT OF GLASSES OR CONTACTS AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF LAYSIC AND IN I DON'T KNOW NINETY NINE PER CENT OF THE TIME IT'S GOIN TO BE LIKE A SAFE COMFORTABLE OUTCOME FOR THE PATIENT DO THEY DO LAYSIC ON KIDS AH THERE ARE CERTAIN CONDITIONS A UNUSUAL CORNEAL CONDITIONS WHERE PRECEDURES LIKE LAYSIC AT USE BUT I BELIEVE AH IT'S IDEAL TO NOT DO IT ON CHOULDRON OR EVEN EVEN YOUNG TEA NATURES AND THE REASON GOES BACK TO WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE YOU ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO CHANGE THE SHAPE OF YOUR EYE AND THEREFORE THE PRESCRIPTION YOU NEED AND THEREFORE WHAT EXACTLY THE LAYSIC WOUTD LAZER WHILE YOU'RE STILL IN THOSE GROWING YEARS AND YOU REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY HAY MY EYE GLASSES PRESCRIPTION HAS NOT CHANGED IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE OR FIVE YEARS BECAUSE IF YOU DO LAYSIC AND THEN YOUR EYE KEEPS CHANGING SHAPE THAND BY THE NEXT YEAR ALL OF US ON THE LAKES LAYSICS NOT DIN YOU'RE BACKIN GLASSES AGAIN RIGHT A YOU CAN DO A TOUCH UP LAYSIC TO A LITTLE BUT MORE BUT IT'S GENERALLY YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONGTO BE A HAPPIER PERSON IF YOU'VE REACHED THAT POINT IN YOUR LIFE AND MAYBE THAT'S MAYBE THAT'S YOUR LATE TEENS MORE COMMONLY IT'S INTO THE TWENTIES WHERE YOUR EYE HAS STOPPED CHANGING ITS PRESCRIPTION EVERY YEAR YOU'VE BEEN STADY AND STABLE FOR SOME YEARS AND NOW YOU DO THE LAYSIC AND IT COULD EASILY LAST YOU A DECADE YOU MENTION DRY EYE IT A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT DRY EYE AND A FEW YEARS AGO I THINK YOU AND I WERE AT A MEETING IN SOME ONE WHO IS VERY WOVEN IN WITH THE COMPANYES THAT BUILD AND TEST DRUGS FOR DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF VISION HEALTH SAID YOU KNOW WHAT THE FIELD REALLY NEEDS IS A TREATMENT THAT WORKS FOR DRY EYE AND I THOUGHT DRY E I LIKE OF ALL THINGS LIKE WY DRY AND THAN THE MORE I LEARNED ABOUT IT I REALIZE THAT THERE MILLIONS AN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT REALLY SUFFER FROM DRY EYE AND FOR WHOM STANDARD DROPS ARE JUST NOT WORKING SO WHAT UNDER LIES DRY EYE IS IT SOME DEFICIENCY IN THE LAC OR ONE GLANDE THAT PRODUCE TEARS FOR THE EYE AND AND I THINK OF TEARS IS JUST GON A SALTY WATER AM AND I WONDER IF THEY ARE MORE THAN THAT AS THERE AN OIL IN THERE AND IF WE KNOW WHAT'S IN TEARS WHY CAN'T SOMEBODY JUST MANUFACTURE SOMETHING THAT WORKS AS WELL AS TEARS YOU KNOW IT TURNS OUT YOU KNOW WE WE WE'VE GOT A LOT OF OTHER EYE DISEASES BUT BY FAR THE MOST COMMON EYE DISEASE AND AND I'VE BEEN TULD BY FAR THE MOST COMMON I TREATMENT YOU KNOW PURCHASED BY ANYONE NOW GRANTED IT'S ALMOSTAYS OVER THE COUNTER THINGS LIKE ARTIFICIAL TEARS IS FOR DRY EYE AND IN PART THAT'S BECAUSE AS WE AGE ARE TEER QUANTITY GOES DOWN AND OUR TEER QUALITY GOES DOWN AND SO WHAT OR THOSE DO MEAN WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT MAJOR ELEMENTS TO TEARS AND AS YOU ALLUDED TO ONE IS THE SALT WATER PORT F PART OF THE TEARS AND THOSE ARE MADE PRIMARILY BY THE LACRIMAL GLAND AND THERE'S A STEADY DRIP OF THOSE TEARS ON TO THE OCULAR SURFACE AS WELL AS REFLECTS IFE TEARING RIGHT IF YOU GET AN EYELASH IN YOUR EYE OR OR YOU CRY YOUR YOUR LACIMAL GRANTALACTALLY SQUEEZE OUT EXTRA SALT WATER TEARS AON TO THE SURFACE OF THE EYE AND SO ASO THAT'S THAT'S WHERE MOST OF THE SOT A WET PART IS COMING FROM BUT THERE'S ALSO ECENTIAL OILS CRITICAL OILS THESE COME FROM OTHER TYPES OF GLANDS INCLUDING GLANDS IN OUR EYELIDS CALLED MY BOOMEIN GLANDS AND THE OILS FORM A SURFACE OVER THE SALT WATER PART OF THE TEAR FILM AND AND ALSO INTERMIX INTO THE TEARS AND AS WE AGE WE GO DOWN IN THE QUANTIT Y OF BOTH SALT WATER PART OF OUR TEARS AND OIL PART OF OUR TEARS BUT ALSO THE QUALITY AND IN PARTICULAR THE OIL PARTS ACAN OFTEN BE SEEN TO BE GOING DOWN WORE QUICKLY THE THE EY DROP INDUSTRY HAS PRETTY MUCH SOLVED FOR REPLACING THE SALT WATER PART OF YOUR TEARS RIGHT YOU CAN GET EITHER BOTTLES OF PRESERVE PRESERVATIVE CONTAINING YOU KNOW YOU CAN USE THAT BOTTLE ALL MONTH OR FOR A MONTH OR TWO OR YOU CAN BUY THESE STRIPS OF PRESERVATIVE FREE ARTIFICIAL TEARS WHICH ARE REALLY BASICALLY LIKE THE SALT WATER COMPONENT AND YOU CAN USE THOSE PRESERVATIVE FREE ONES WE HAVE PATIENCE USING THEM EVERY HOUR IF THEY NEED TO AR YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HEARD ANYTHING WITH PRESERVATIVE FREE ARTIFICIAL TEARS YES DROP THEMEN JUST DROP THEM IN YET EITHER EY IS AS OFTEN AS YOU WANT OR NEED WHEN YOU FEEL IT IT'S EXASTERBATED IN THE WORLD WE LIVE IN A A ESPECIALLY THESE DAYS NOW WITH MORE TIME ON COMPUTER IT TURNS OUT THAT WHEN YOU READ INCLUDING WHEN WE MAY BE USED TO READ MORE BOOKS THAN WE DO NOW BUT ALSO READ ON THE COMPUTER OR STARE AT THE COMPUTER SCREEN OR WORK ON THE COMPUTER OR ACTUALLY JUST EVEN WATCH THE T V DONES VERY CAREFUL STUDIES YOU BLINK LESS WHEN YOU'RE DOING ANY OF THOSE ACTIVITIES AND WHEN YOU BLINK GLASS YOUR REDISTRIBUTING THE TEERS LESS EFFECTIVELY AND YOU ARE SQUEEZING OUT LESS OF THE TEERS INCLUDING LESS OF THE OILS A AS EFFECTIVELY AS YOU COULD BE WHEN YOU'RE BLINKING AND SO AM SO BETWEEN AGING TEER QUALITY TEER QUANTITY A LOT OF OUR ACTIVITIES WERE CIND OF IN THIS LOSING PROPOSITION NOW NOW I MENTION THAT I WERE PRETTY GOOD AT REPLACING THE WET SALTY PART OF OUR TARS BUT ACTUALLY AS AN INDUSTRY WE HAVEN'T REALLY FIGURED OUT A HAD A REALLY EFFECTIVELY REPLACE THE OILY PART AND THE OILS DO A FEW THINGS INCLUDING WHEN YOU HAVE A LAYR OF OIL ON TOP OF A LAYR OF WATER THE WATER'S LESS LIKELY TO EVAPORATE AND SO THE OILS HELP HOLD THE TEERS ON THE SURFACE OF YOUR EYE AND SO IF WE'RE NOT MAKING AS MANY OR AS GOOD OILS AS PART OF OUR TEAR FILM THAT'S A THAT'S ALSO LIKE CINT OF WORKIN AGAINST THE SALT WATER PART OF OUR TEARS A SO YET AS AN INDUSTRY IS AS A COMMUNITY THWE HAVEN'T REALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO GET THE OIL PART SALVE FAR EITHER BY EFFECTIVELY REPLACING THE OILS OR TREATING OUR EYELIDS IN A WAY KIN OF REJUVINATING THOSE OI OIL GLANDS GETTING THEM TO CANNOT GO BACK TO THEIR YOUTHFUL STATE AGAIN YOU KNOW STHE THE EYES INCLUDING THE ISLADS IN THE OIL GLANDS AN FORSENLY THEIR AGING JUST LIKE THE REST OF OUR BODY SO SO THIS IS THIS THIS IS ONE OF THE MAGOR FEATURES  IS A IS DRY EYE AND AND AND IT'S TOUGH ON PATIENCE BECAUSE YOU FEEL IT T'S REALLY TOUGH BECAUSE YOU FEEL IT I HAVE YET ANOTHER EXPERIENCE TO REPORT WHERE WHEN I HAD THE BLUFFERITUS  WHICH FORTUNATELY WAS TRANSIENT I ALSO EXPERIENED AT EVERY TIME I BLINK I COULD FEEL THE BLINK AND BOY I'LL TELL YOU E WE ALL MOST OF US TAKE FOR GRANTED A WHAT IT PLEASURE IT IS TO NOT OBSERVE THE BLINKING OF OUR EYES BECAUSE FOR THOSE I THANY LESS ABOUT TWO WEEKS EVERY TIME I BLINK I'D FEEL AN ALMOST SAND PAPER LIK EXPERIENCE IT WASN'T PARTICULARLY PAINFUL BUT IT WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE IT SUDDENLY CONSCIOUS OF EVERY BLINK AND IT'S VERY DISTRACTING AN THAT RESOLVED WHEN THE BLUFFERIDIS RESOLVED BUT I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE WHA WOUD WE LIKE TO DEAL WITH THAT ALL DAY LONG EVERY DAY THE IRELY DREADFUL YES IT REALLY IS AN AND SO YOU'RE ABSOLULY RIGHT IT'S A VERY IT'S ONE OF OUR REALLY BIG UNMET NEEDS AND AND ALTHOUGH FOR MOST PEOPLE WITH DRY EYE IT CAN BE MANAGED WITH JUST THE REGULAR OVER THE COUNTER ARTIFICIAL T UR DROPS YOU CAN BIDE THE GROCERY STORE OVER THE COUNTER AT THE FARMICY FOR A SUBSET OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE REALLY MUCH MORE SEVERE SYMPTOMS WITH THE DRY EYE IT'S IT'S REALLY IT'S HARD IT'S A REALLY HARD THING TO HAVE TO LIVE WITH ALL THE TIME AND AND WE COUNSEL ON THE USE OF TEERS WE COUNTS ON THE USE OF AEYELID CLEANING LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE WE TAKE EITHER THESE EYELID SCROBS OR A LITTLE DILUTE BABY CHAMPOO TO KEEP THOSE EYELASHES REALLY CLEAN THAT KEEPS THOSE OIL GLANDS FUNCTIONING AT THEIR TOP CAPACITY FOR YOU AH SO THAT YOUR MAXIMIZING YOU KNOW HIGH QUALITYS YOUR PRODUCTION REDUCING INFLAMMATION IS ALSO IMPORTANT WHETHER THAT'S INFLAMMATION FROM ALARGY AND O CORSE A LOT OF PEOPLE'S DRY EYE GETS MUCH WORSE IN THE SPRING WITH SEASONAL ALARGIES WHEN POLLEN IS AROUND IF YOU HAVE DOSTALARGIES IN YOUR HOME AHA THAT WORSENS YOUR SYMPTEMATIC DRY EYE A OR OTHER FORMS OF INFLAMMATION THERE'S A THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF DRY EYE THAT WE ACTUALLY THINK IS INFLAMMATION KIND OF WORKING AGAINST OUR TEER GLANDS AND AND IN FACT SOME OF THE PRESCRIPTION DROPS NOW TO HELP COMBAT MORE SEVERE DRY EYE AH OUR ANTIINFLAMMATORY OR EVEN LUDO STERROID TYPES OF EYEDROPS A SO I THINK THESE ARE ALL AS OR OF NEXT GENERATION TREATMENTS I THINK IT THE AT THE REALLY LEADING EDGE OF NEXT GENERATION TREATMENT IS TRYING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE NERVES ON THE CORNEA AND OCULAR SURFAC AND IF THEIR WAYS THAT WE COULD BETTER TREAT THEM AND HELP HELP REGENERATE AND REJUVENATE CONHOW THE NERVES AND THE AND THE TISSUE CELLS ARE INERACTING UNDERNEATH THAT TEAR FILM AND THAT'S WHERE FOR SOME PATIENTS WE CAN ACTUALLY USE A EITHER FOR EXAMPLE BLOOD SERAND YOUR BLOOD SERUM IS ACTUALLY VERY RICH IN GROWTH FACTORS AND MANY OF THOSE GROWTH FACTORS IT TURNS OUT EMPIRICALLY ARE REALLY HELPFUL FOR PEOPLE WITH DRY EYE SO IF YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO'S BEEN REALLY STRUGGLING WITH WITH DRY EYE YOU MIGHT ASK YOUR EYE CURE PROV ITOR HEYI I HEARD ABOUT SYRUM TEARS AS THAT SOMETHING THAT COULD HELP ME SEERUM TEERS SEERA THIS PEARPPE IS THIS PLATERICH BLASMU ITRELATED BUT BUT NOT THE PLATEPLATELIT RICH PORTIUM AT LEAST NOT YET THEY CAN DRAW YOUR BLOOD SPIN OUT ALL THE CELLS YOU'RE LEFT WITH THE KIND OF LIQUID PART OF YOUR BLOOD THAT'S THE SERUM AND THEN THEY CAN DILUTE THAT WITH SOME SALT WATER MAYBE WITH SOME PRESERVATIVES IN SOME CASES E YOU CAN KEEP IT IN YOUR FREEZER THAWOUT THE BOTTLE WHEN YOU'RE READY TO USE IT YOU KNOW EACH A FEW WEEKS AND AND THEN USE IT JUST LIKE AN EYEDROPER BOTTLE AND THOSE SYRUM TEERS A ACTUALLY CAN BE VERY HELPFUL FOR PEOPLE WITH WITH MUCH MORE ADVANCED OR SEVERE HARD TO CONTROL DRY EYE SYMPTOMS A COMPANIES ARE REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HEPE WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE THE SERUM CAN WE JUST IDENTIFY IN PACKAGE JUST THE GROWTH FACTOR AND AND TURN THAT INTO A PRODUCT FOR DRY EYE PATIENTS AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THE OCULAR SURFACE AND DRY EYE A GOING INTO I'M BGOING INTO THAT SPACE RIGHT NOW I'LL TELL YOU THE ONE OTHER RECOMMENDATION THAT I ALWAYS GIVE PATIENTS THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE THAT IF YOU'RE GETTING TOO MUCH OF SOME OF THESE PRESERVATIVE CHEMICALS A WHICH OF COURSE IF YOU'RE GONG TO USE AN EYEDROP BOTTLE FOR A MONTH IT SHOULD HAVE A PRESERVATIVE IN IT RIGHT SO THAT YOU DON'T OPEN THE BOTTLE AND THEN IT GROWS BACTERIA COUPLE WEEKS LATER NOW YOU'RE YOU'RE YOURE YOU KNOW YOU'RE USING CONTAMINATED EYEDROPS A SO FOR BOTTLES IT'S TYPICAL TAVE PRESERVATIVES BUT I REALLY RECOMMEND FOR PATIENS IF THEY'RE USING ANYTHING MORE THAN A COUPLE DROPS HERE AND THERE A FURTHER DRY EYE CONTROL TO ACTUALLY GO FOR ONE OF THE PRESERVATIVE FREE ARTIFICIAL TEARS THEY COME IN LOTS OF BRANDS AND SHURE THE HOUSE BRANDS THAT AT ANY OF THE FARMISSESE USE THEM TO I MAKE THEM TO AND THESE ARE THE ONES THEY COME IN LIKE STRIPS PLASTIC STRIPS AND YOU BREAK ONE OFF YOU BREAK OFF THE LITTLE CAP YOU CAN USE AS MUCH AS YOU WANT ALL DAY YOU HAVE TO THROW THAT ONE OUT IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING LEFT OVER HAVE TO THROW IT OUT AT THE END OF THE NIGHT AND THE NEXT DAY BREAK OFF TA NEW ONE BECAUSE THERE'S NO PRESERVATIVES AND ONCE YOU OPEN IT YOU DON'T WANT BACTERIA TO GROW IN THAT SALT WATER RIGHT A BUT IT'S REALLY GOOD BECAUSE THE PRESERVATIVES CAN BE VERY IRRITATING OR EVEN IN FLAMATORY TO THE OCULAR SURFACE TO THE SURFACE OF OUR EYES SO WE REALLY DO WANT TO IF WE'RE USING MORE THAN A DROPPER TO UPGRADE THEY COST A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY THEY'RE STILL OVER THE COUNTER UPGRAD YOURSELF TO THE PRESERVATIVE FREE ARTIFICIAL TEARS THOSE ARE GREAT RECOMMENDATIONS AM ALSO REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS CYRUM THING A BECAUSE YOU KNOW WERE THIS DISCUSSION TAKING PLACE TEN YEARS AGO AND I RAISE P R P PLATELRICH PLAZMA THEREWRE POLLYBEA LOT OF IROLES NO PUNINTENDED BECAUSE I THINK MYSELF AND A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE IN THE 'S CALL THE SORT OF STANDARD SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL COMMUNITY LOOKED AT PLATELET RICH PLAZMA RIGHT ALONGSIDE STEMSELL THERAPIECE BECAUSE THEY WERE CHEEK TO JOWL BACK THEN AS YOU RECALL BEFORE THE F T ER REGULATIONS ABOUT STEMSELL CLAIMS WHICH WE WILL GET TO A OF COURSE P R P WAS SUGGESTED AS A SOURCE OF STEMSELLS AT TURNS OUT THERE VERY FEW IF ANY TRUE STEMSELLS IN P RP AND YET NOW AS I UNDERSTAND IT P R P IS AN F T E APPROVED PROTO CALL FOR INJECTION INTO A THE UTERIS INJECTION INTO PRETTY MUCH EVERY TISSUE AND ORGAN SYSTEM OF THE BODY IN ORDER TO QUOTIN QUO REJUVENATE IT AND HERE I'M NOT PROMOTING P RP AND YET IT IS A VERY COMMON PRACTICE NOW IN MORE STANDARD MEDICAL CLINICS BUT IT STARTED OFF KIND O NICHE EVEN GRAYMARKET KIND OF UNDERGROUND IT'S DIVERGED FROM STEMSELL THERAPIECE AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MAJOR MODES OF VISION LOSS IN A MOMENT AND THIS HORRIBLE SITUATION THAT HAPPEND DOWN IN FLORIDA OF A CLENIC INJECTING STEMSELLS INTO PATIENT'S EYES TO RECOVER VISION AND IT ACTUALLY BLINDED THEM SO WE'LL TALK ABOUT STEMSELF THERAPIECE BUT FOR THE RECORD IS P R P SOMETHING THAT S NOW STANDARD IN MAJOR OPTHEMOPTHELMIC CLINICS EXCUSE ME INCLUDING YOUR DEPARTMENT AT STAMFORD ARE YOU DRAWING OUT BLOOD SPINNING IT DOWN TAKING PLASMA TAKING SERUM AND REINJECTING IT OR REAPPLYING IT TO PATIENCY EYES NOT NOT YET IN OPTHEMOLOGY A IN I CLINICS I WOULD SAY WERE SORT OF LIKE RIGHT NOW ON THE EDGE OF A GROUPS ARE STARTING TO STUDY THAT IS IT SAFE IS IT VALUABLE IS IT ANY BETTER FOR CERTAIN CONDITIONS LIKE ON THE OCULAR SURFACE THEN SRUM TEERS FOR EXAMPLE THIS SORT OF DILUTING A PATIENTS OWN ON BLOOD SERUM AH SO SO IT'S BEING STUDIED IT'S A VERY ACTIVE AREA NO IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS P R P APLASMA HAS A YOU KNOW AGAIN LIKE A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF GROWTH FACTORS THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF THE KINOF WH TISSUE REJUVENATION EFFACTS A I BETHET BETHE AS THEY MAY BUT BUT IT'S BEING STUDIED BUT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT A STANDARD OF CARRY AT  AT LEAST IN IN OPTHEMOLOGY SPACE AND AND YOU KOW I THINK WHENEVER THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY NEW IT REALLY DESERVES TO BE PROPERLY STUDIED WE TALK BEFORE ABOUT YOU KNOW AT FIRST YOU'RE GING TO DO TRIALS WERE YOU JUST TEST IT CAREFULLY IN A FEW PEOPLE MAY BE A FEW OF THE MOST SEVERELY EFFECTIVE BEFFECTED PATIENTS BE REALLY THOUGHPFUL ABOUT  YOU KNOW THE EFFECTS OF TRYING OUT FOR SAFETY THEN AS YOU DEVELOP A LITTLE UNDERSTANDING OF THE SAFETY YOU REALLY WANT TO EVENTUALLY GET TO PROPERLY CONTROLLED RANDOMIZE WHAT PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY OFTEN CALL DOUBLE BLIND TRIALS BUT WE ANOPTHEMOLOGY LIKE TO CALL DOUBLE MASKED TRIAL BLIND IS A BAD WORD AERO WE DO'T WANT TO BLIND TRIALS SO YOU REALLY WANT PROPERLY CONTROLLED TRIALS TESTING IS IT REALLY WORKING IS IT REALLY DESERVE THE CLAIMS THAT PEOPLE ARE MAKING AND THAT HAS NOT YET REALLY COME TO FRUITION AT THAT LEVEL FOR OPTHEMOLOGYER I CARRY AT SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT NORMAL VISUAL DEVELOPMENT I CHECKS AND SOME OF THE WORE TYPICAL CHALLENGES THAT PEOPLE HAVE WITH THEIR VISION BUT WE HAVEN'T YET TOUCHED ON SOME OF THE REALLY DEBILITATING STUFF THINGS LIKE GLAUCOMA THINGS LIKE RETENIDISPIGMANTOSA MACULAR DEGENERATION THE THINGS THAT IF WE COULD WE WOULD ALL AVOID AND YET ARE OUT THERE IN THE WORLD AT PRETTY HIGH RATES YO I'M SURE YOUL SHARE WITH US WHAT THOSE RATES ARE AND AS BAD AS THESE THINGS ARE THERE ARE WAYS TO DETECT AND OFFSET THERE PROGRESSION SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T NECESSARILY LOSE THEIR VISION SO IF YOU COULD CON YOU SHARE WITH US WHAT ARE THE MAJOR FORMS OF VISION LOSS IN CHILDHOOD AND AN ADULTHOOD AND WHAT CAN EACH IN ALL OF US DO IN ORDER TO FIND OUT IF WE HAVE ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS AND THEREFORE TREAT IT EFFECTIVELY YE THAT'S GREAT YOU KNOW LET'S START BY JUST REMINDING OURSELVES WHAT ARE THE MAJOR CAUSES OF VISION LOSS AND THESE ARE GOING TO DIFFER WHERE YOU ARE IN THE WORLD BUT THE MAJOR THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF LOW VISION IS ACTUALLY REFRACTIVE OR PEOPLE WHO NEED GLASSES AND ESPECIALLY IN OTHER COUNTRIES AFFORDABILITY ACTS AS CAN'T EVEN GET GLASSES O CASE SO THAT'S JUST REFRACTIVE OR BUT THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY CORRECTABLE THE NEXT MOST COMMON CAUSE OF VISION LOSS IS CATARACT CATARACT IS THE BLURRING AGING OF THE LENS INSIDE THE EYE BEHIND THE CORNEAN WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR FOCUSSING LIGHT UNDER THE BACK OF THE EYE OSS US TO BE CLEAR ENOUGH THAT THE LIGHT GETS THROUGH THE LANDS AND A CATARACT IS A NORMAL AGING PROSESS A UNOW IS I SAID IF WE ALL LIVE TO A HUNDRED OR A HUNDRED TEN YEARS OLD WHILE ALL GET CATARACTS WHILE ALL NEED CATARACTS URGIN WE ACTUALLY AS EU KNOWIN IN THE EYECLINIC WE SEE CATARACTS YEARS ARE EVEN DECADES BEFORE THE EFFECTING YOUR VISION IN A MEANING FUL WAY SO THAT TA CATARACTS ARE FORMING AND THAT'S SO KA BUT AT SOME POINT THEY GET BAD ENOUGH THAT IT'S TIME TO TAKE THEM OUT WE'VE ACTUALLY SOLVED FOR CATARACT SURGERY PRETTY EFFICIENTLY WE CAN DO A FOR TO EIGHT MINUTES SURGERY MAYBE IF WE'RE TAKEN OR TIME IT'S TEN OR TWELVE MINUTES OF SURGICAL TIME TAKE OUT A CATARACT IT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY NINETY NINE POINT SOMETHING PERSEND OF THE TIME WE PUT A PLASTIC A CLEAR PLASTIC LENS INSIDE THE EYE EXACTLY WHERE YOUR LENDS USED TO BE AND THEREIS EVEN LENSES THAT CAN PLAXS OR FOCUS LIFE FROM FAR AND NEAR SO CATARACT IS FUNDAMENTALLY A THERE'S STILL ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT BUT THERE'S IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY A SOLVED PROBLEM AH THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT WORLD WIDE THERE AREN'T ENOUGH CATARACT SURGEONS THERE'S NOT ACES TO CARE THE MACHINERY OR THE LENS IS A COST TOO MUCH MONEY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO GET OUT TO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD NEED THEM SO IT'S ACTUALLY JUST AGAIN AN ACES TO CURE CATARACT IS A REVERSIBLE TREATABLE EASILY TREATABLE PROBLEM BUT IT'S NUMBER TOO ON THE LIST OF CAUSES OF VISION LOSS IN THE WORLD BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ACES TO CARRE WE NEED A LOT MARCER TO PROGRAMMING AROUND GLOBALOPTHEMOLOGY GLOBIL I CARE TO SOLVE FOR CATARACT A JUST TO BRING THAT SOLUTION TO COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD THEN AFTER THAT YOU START HITTING THE I DISEASES THAT LEAD TO WHAT ARE CURRENTLY IRREVERSIBLE NON REVERSIBLE CAUSES OF VISION LOSS THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF IRREVERSIBLE VISION LOSS IN THE WORLD IS GLOCOMA SO WHAT IS CAL CLOMA CLO COMMOS ACTUALLY PROBABLY A LITTLE CLUSTER OR CONSTELLATION OF DISEASES THAT WE LUMP TO GATHER IT'S A DEGENERATIVE DISEASE LIKE A NURR DEGENERATION WE TALK ABOUT NARVE DEGENERATIONS IN THE BRAIN LIKE ALZIMERS AND PARKINSON'S GLOCOM A IS A NURED GENERATIVE DISEASE IT HAPPENS INSTEAD OF AFFECTING ONE OR DIFFERENT AREAN YOUR RAIN IT HAPPENS TO A FACT THE OPTIC NERVE THAT CONNECTS THE EYE TO THE BRAIN AND WE NEED OUR OPTIC NERVES CARRY ALL THE VISUAL INFORMATION FROM THE EYE TO THE BRAIN AND SO IF YOUR OPTIC NERVE IS DEGENERATING IN GLAUCOMA AND I SHOULD ADD THEIR OTHER OPTIC NEROPATHES A SO CALLED DISEASES OF OPTIC NERVE DEGENERATION FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN GET A STROKE OF THE OPTIC NERVE YOU CAN HAVE AN INFLAMATORY DISEASE LIKE MULTIBLE SCLAROSIS CALLED OPTIC NERITIS THAT AFFECTS THE OPTIC NERVE AS YOU CAN GET OTHER OPTIC NERVE DISEASES ABAKLAUCOM IS BY FAR THE MOST COMMON OPTIC NEROPATHY AND THE PROMIS IS JUST LIKE YOU KNOW JUST LIKE SPINAL CORD INJURY WHICH IS ALSO PART OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM RIHT THE BRAIN THE SPINAL CORD THE RAT IN THE OPTIC NERVE THAT'S THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THERE'S NO REGENERATION THAT'S LIKE SPINAL CORT INJURY LEADS TO PERMANENT PARALYSIS WILL OPTIC NERVE INGURY OR OPTIC NERVE DEGENERATION UNFORTUNATELY LEADST A PERMANENT VISION LOSS SO IN THE CASE OF GLAUCOMA HOW DO WE GET AHEAD OF THAT GLAUCOMA HAS TWO MAJOR RISFACTORS ONE IS INCREASING AGE THERE ARE ACTUALLY INFANTILE AND PEDIATRIC LAUCOMA'S UNFORTUNATELY AND THOSE CAN BE MUCH MORE AGRESSIVE MUCH MORE DAMAGING WHEN THEY PRESENT SO EARLY IN KIDS AH IN BABIES AN INCHALDREN MOST OF THE KIND OF RUN OF THE MILL GLAUCOMA USUALLY PRESULTS PRESENTS IN ADULTHOOD AND EVEN IN IN THE AGING ADULTS SO MUCH MORE COMMON AFTER FIFTY OR SIXTY OR SEVENTY YEARS OLD INCREASING THE OTHER MAIN RISFACTOR FOR GLAUCOMA IS INCREASING EYE PRESSURE THE EYE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW IT STAYS INFLATED IT'S A BALLOON ITS HAS TO STAY INFLATED WE NEED SOME AMOUNT OF EYE PRESSURE TO KEEP OUR EYE IS AS AN INFLATED BALLOON BUT IF THE EYE PRESSURE GOES TOO HIGH AND WE TIME OF THIS BEFORE YOU WON'T EVEN FEEL IT IF IT SLOWLY GETS TOO HIGH IF THE EYE PRESSURE GOES TOO HIGH THAT CAUSES GLAUCOUMA AND A AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT YOUR REALLY INCLUDE IN A COMPREHENSIVE EYXAM WHEN YOU'RE JUST GETTING A SCREENING CHECKO AT YOUR EYE CARE PROVIDOR AT YOUR APTOMATRIST DROPTHEMOLOGIST OFFICE THEY'RE GONGTO CHECK YOUR PRESSURE AND JUST AS A SCREENING TOIL CHECK TO MAKE SURE ITS NOT TOO HIGH WE CAN TREAT GLAUCOMA TO DAY BY TRYING TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF THAT HEYE PRESSURE BY LOWERING THE EYE PRESSURE SO WE HAVE TREATMENTS FOR GLAUCOMA THAT TARGET THE EYE PRESSURE WE HAVE MEDICATIONS LIKE EE DROPS WE HAVE LAZERS THAT CAN BE USED INSIDE THE EYE THAT CAN ALSO LOWER THE EYE PRESSURE AND ULTIMATELY IF WE NEED THAT WE ALSO OV SURGERIES THAT CAN ALSO PROVIDE AN OUTFLOW THAT LETS THE FLUID OUT OF THE EYE IN A CONTROLLED WAY SO THAT THE EYE PRESSURE CAN BE BROUGHT BACK DOWN INTO NORMAL RANGES AGAIN THE REASON THAT GLAUCOMA ENDS UP BEING THE NUMBER ONE CAWS OF IRREVERSIBLE BLINDNESS IN THE WORLD IS NUMBER ONE WE CAN'T GET THOSE THERAPEES EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD THE AFFORDABILITY OF EYEDROPS THE ACCESS TO LAZERS OR SURGICAL PROCEDURES AROUND THE WORLD ISN'T EQUAL TO WHAT IT IS HERE AND EVEN WITHIN OUR COUNTRY YOU KNOW PEOPLE MAY NOT BE ACCESSING HEALF CARE EFFECTIVELY TO GET SCREENED FOR GLAUCUMA ALREADY GET TREATED FOR GLAUCMA THE OTHER BIG PROM WITH GLAUCOMA IS THAT IT EFFECTS OUR PERIFERAL VISION FIRST AND ONLY VERY LATE IN THE DISEASE DOES IT PINCH IN AND FINALLY PINCH OFF THE CENTER OF OUR VISION IN TYPICAL GLAUCOUMAS AND THAT'S A REAL PROM BECAUSE WE DON'T NOTICE IF OUR PRIFERAL VISION IS DOWN IN OUR PERIFERAL VISION ISN'T THAT GOOD TO BEGIN WITH AND IF YOU'RE DRIVING AND YOU CAN SEE A PEDESTRIAN STEP OFF THE SIDEWALK YOU THINK YOUR PERPRIERAL VISION IS FINE BUT ACTUALLY OU PERIFERAL VISION COULD ALREADY START BEING DAMAGED BY GLACOMA AND YOU WON'T NOTICE IT IN REGULAR DAILY LIFE AND THAT'S WHERE THE IMPORTANCE OF SCREENING AN EARLY DETECTION REALLY COMES IN FOR GLACOMA WHAT WE DON'T HAVE FOR GLACOMAN WE CAN COME BACK TIL LI CONNA WHAT'S THE CUTTINGADGE OF THE FUTURE IN THESE IYE DISEASES WHAT WE DON'T HAVE OUR TREATMENTS THAT REALLY TARGET THE OPTIC NERVE DEGENERATIVE CROCESS AND A WE CAN COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT THAT SO THAT'S CAL COMAN OPTIC NOROPATHES THEN THE NEXT TWO MAJOR CAUSES OF CURRENTLY LARGELY IRREVERSIBLE VISION LOSS OUR AGE RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION AND TAND DIABETIC RATINOPATHE NOW AGE RELATED MACULAR GENERATION IS JUST LIKE ITS SOUNDS MAJOR RISFACTOR'S AGE IT'S VERY COMMON AND ACTUALLY IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD YOU KNOW COUNTRIES THAT ARE MORE DEVELOPED ALSO COUNTRIES THAT HAVE A LARGER CAUCATION WHITE POPULATION IT'S MORE COMMON IN CERTAIN POPULATIONS THAN IN OTHERS A IT ACTUALLY IS YOU KNOW ITDEFINALLY A LEADING CAUSE OF VISION LOSS IN THE ELDERLY POPULATION FOR EXAMPLE IN THE UNITED STATES A AND A THERE'S TWO FORMS OF MACULAR DEGENERATION BUT THEY BOTH END A TARGETING THE SAME PART THE SAME PART OF THE RATINA AND THAT PART OF THE RATINA IS REALLY LIKE THE RODS AND THE CONES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THE RODS DO YOUR LOWLIGHT VISION AT NIGHTTIME OT PRIMARILY YOUR CONES DO COLOR VISION AND BRIGHT LIGHT I YOU KNOW SORT OF NORMAL LIGHTINGA THAT WE EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW THROUGH MOST OF OUR AWEAKE DAY AND IN THAT BACK OF THE RATINA YOU CAN HAVE WHAT'S CALLED DRY MACULAR DEGENERATION WHICH IS A SLOW THANKFULLY SLOW BUT SLOW INSIDIOUS DISEASE THAT CAUSES THE DEGENERATION OF THE RODS AND CONES AND ALSO THE SUPPORT CELLS THAT HELP FEED THE RODS AND CONES AND TAKE CARE OF THE RODS AND CONES THEY'RE CALLED ARPE E CELLS RATINAL PIGMANAPITHELIUMINT'S NOT REALLY CRITICAL OF COURSE ATHE NAMES OF EVERY DIFFERENT CELTYPE BUT THESE ARE LIKE THE THE THE LIGHT COLLECTING CELLS IN OUR EYES IN THE RATINAND THEY DEGENERATE IN MACULAR DEGENERATION AND IN THE DRY FORM THERE'S THE SLOW DEGENERATION BUT SOME PERCENT OF PEOPLE WITH THE DRY FORM OF MACULAR GENERATION WILL ACTUALLY CONVERT TO WHAT'S CALLED THE WET FORM TIT'S CALLED WET BECAUSE NEW BLOOD VESSALS ACTUALLY GROW INAPPROPRIATELY UNDER AND EVEN INTO THE RATINA AND NEW BLOOD VESSALS UNLIKE OUR MATURE BLOOD VESSALS TEND TO BE LEEKY AND SO THAT THE FLUID LEAKS OUT OF THOSE BLOOD VESSALS GETS INTO THE RATIN INTERFERES WITH VISION AND THAT CAN LEAD TO A MUCH MORE ACUTE LOSS OF VISION NOW WE HAVE SOME TREATMENTS FOR WET MACULA DEGENERATION WE HAVE INJECTIONS THAT CONE CAN GO INTO THE EYE THAT ACTUALLY FIGHT AGAINST THE MOLECULES THAT ARE CAUSING THOSE NEW BLOOD VESSALS TO GROW AND THESE ARE ANTIBODIES THAT CAN BE INJECTED OF THE IAND THEY CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE CONTROLLING PATIONS WET MACULA DEGENERATION IT'S BEEN A MUCH BIGGER UPHILL BATTLE EVEN OVER THE LAST DECATE OF AS ADVANCES ARE BEING MADE TO TO REALLY TRY TO KNOCK BACK OR OR OR SLOW DOWN EVEN THE DRY FORM OF MACULA DEGENERATION THERE IS JUST SOME EXCITING NEWS EVEN JUST IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS THE FIRST A SUCCESSFUL TRIALS OF A TREATMENT FOR THE DRY FORM  HAVE JUST SHOWN SUCCESS IN PROPERLY RANDOMIZE CONTROLLED HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS FASE THREE CLINICAL TRIALS SO IT'S AN EXCITING TIME THOSE NEW TREATMENTS ARE NOT GOING TO BE A PANISEEA THEY SLOW THE PROGRESSION LIKE THE ANANATOMIC PROGRESSION OF THE DISEASE A MAYBE BY TWENTY OR T ENTY FIVE PER CENT SO SURPATIONS ARE STILL GOING TO GET WORSE EVEN WITH THOSE TREATMEN SO THERE STILL A LOK MORE TO BE DONE TO REALLY KNOCK BACK MACULAR DEGENERATION I WANT TO MENTION YOU MENTION RETINITES PIGMANTOSA THAT'S LIKE AN INHERITED FORM AF A TYPE OF MACUA DEGENERATION IT'S ALSO AFFACTING THE RODS AND CONES AND ALSO THESE SUPPORT CELLS THE ARPE ECELLS IN THE BACK OF THE IE RETNIZES PIGMANTOSA IS AN INHERITED FORM THERE ARE ACTUALLY MANY DIFFERENT GENES YOU COULD HAVE THAT COULD LEAVE TO RETINIZ PIGNUNS PIGMANTOSA INAGGREGATE IF YOU AD UP ALL THE PEOPLE WITH ALL THOSE DIFFERENT GENES A AN ANICABE VERY DEVASTATING CAUSE IT CAN REALLY AFFECT THE VISION KNOCK OUT YOUR VISION VERY EARLY IN LIFE INCLUDING IN CHILDREN AND EVEN FOR VERVERSIONS OF THAT IN BABIES BUT YOU ADD THAT LL UP IT'S STILL MUCH LESS COMMON IN AGGREGATE THE MACUO DEGENERATION BUT IN THE WAY IT'S YOU KNOW QUITE A BIT MORE SEVERE BECAUSE IT DOES AFFECT PEOPLE MUCH EARLIER IN LIFE SO SO I SORT OF CLUMP THOSE TO GATHER MACA D GENERATION RATINITIZ PIGMANTOSA DEGENERATION OF THE RODS AND CONES AND THE SUPPORT CELLS THE ARPEE SUPPORT CELLS AND THEN YOU YOU CAN'T HAVE THIS PART OF THE DISCUSSION ABOUT WATER THET DEVASTATING EYE DISEASES WITHOUT BRING UP DIABETIC RATINOP OF THE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE DIABEDES UNFORTUNATELY REALLY CONTINUES TO GROW IN ESPECIALLY LET'S SAY IN THE UNITED STATE CERTAINLY IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD YOU KNOW AS WE A ESPECIALLY TYPTOO DIABETES WITH EATING HABITS EXERCISE HABITS CONTRIBUTING TO A PROLIFERATION OF SOME OF THE RISK FACTORS FOR TYPTU DIABEDES METABOLIC CINDRUM OF BECITE AH WE'RE UNFORTUNATELY SEEING A PROLIFERATION A GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OF DIABEDES AND WITH THE GROWTH AND DIABEDES UNFORTUNATELY COMES A GROWTH OF THE COMPLICATIONS OF DIABEDES AND ONE OF THE MAJOR COMPLICATIONS OF DIABE DTES IS DAMAGE TO THE RATINA INSIDE THE EYE AND WE CALL THAT DIABETIC RATANOPATHE AND THERE AGAIN SOME OF THE SAME DAMAGE THAT OCCURS ESPECIALLY WHEN IN DIABEDES AGAIN SOME NEW BLOOD VESSELS OR GROWING OR BLOOD VESSELS ARE LEEKY SOME OF THAT CAN BE TREATED WITH USED TO BE LAZERS AND NOW MORE COMMONLY AS OFTEN BEING TREATED WITH SOME OF THE SAME INJACTABLE DRUGS THAT ARE TREATING MACULAR DEGENERATION ABUT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF VISION LOSS WITH DIABETES AND DIABETIC RATANOPATHE I THINK THAT'S AN AREA WHERE AGAIN EARLY SCREENING MAKING SURE I YOU HAVE DIABEDES THAT'S THAT'S AN INDICATION WHERE YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO BE GOING IN AND GETTING YOUR ANT AT LEAST ANNUAL EXAM WITH AN IE CARE PROVIDEOR OR HAVING SOMEONE TAKE A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE INSIDE YOUR EYE AND RATE THAT PHOTOGRAPH TO SAY IF YOU HAVE ANY DIABETICRATNOPATHEOR NOT IN TERMS OF INTERVENTIONS CAN WE TALK ABOUT DIABETIC RETANOPATHY FIRST BECAUSE COURSE TYPE ONE DIABEDES IS A FAILURE TO PRODUCE INSOLEN RELATIVELY RARE COMPARED TO TYPE TWO DIABEDES WHICH AS YOU MENTION IS PRELIFERATING IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WRITE THIS IS PROBABLY UNPRECEDENTED IN THE SENSE THAT DEVELOPING COUNTRIES HAVE BETTER MEDICAL CARATYPICALLY THAN NON DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AM MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOOD NOURISHMENT AND ET IT'S CLEARLY A PROBLEM OF OVER NOURISHMENT A INSOLENT INSENSITIVITY OBESITY ET CETERA IS THIS TYPE OF DIABETIC WRITENOPATHY THAT ONE OBSERVES THE SAME FOR TYPE ONE DIABETICS VERSES TYPE TWO DIABETICS BECAUSE MANORSTANDING IS THAT TYPE TWO DIABEDES THIS INSOLENT INSENSITIVITY IS A BIT OF A CONTINUUM RIGHT I MEAN THE TYPE ON DIABES IS AS FAR AS I KNOW IS ALL OR NONE EITHER MAKE INSOLENT OR YOU DON'T BETYPE TOO DIABEDES SOMEONE COULD BE MILDLY IN INSOLENT INSENSITIVE OR SEVERELY INSOLENT INSENSITIVE AND SOMETIMES I'M TO LD PEOPLE ARE NOT NECESSARILY OBES AND CAN HAVE TYPE TO DIABEDES AS WELL M CERTAINLY THINGS LIKE SMOKING IN ALCOHOL IN TAPE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THAT SO HOW EQUIVALENT ARE TYPE ONE IN TYPE TO DIABEDES WHEN FRAMED UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF DIABETIC RATINOPATHY YA THE THE THE TIME TO PRESENTATION CAN BE DIFFERENT A TYPE ONE DIABATIC USUALLY PRESENTS WITH SORT OF A CATACLYSMIC SUDDEN LOSS SUDDEN SORT OF FINAL LOSS OF THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE INSOLEN IT USUALLY PRESENTS IN CHILDHOOD OR TEEN AGE YEARS BUT CAN PRESENT YOU CAN HAVE LAID ONSET TYPE ONE DIABETES BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF A SUDDEN PRESENTATION IT CAN TAKE SOME YEARS AFTER THAT TO SHOW ANY DIABETIC RTINOPATHY WHEREAS JUST BECAUSE T JUST JUST LIKE YOU SAID TYPE TO DIABEDES CAN BE ON A CONTINU AND PEOPLE CAN HAVE WLHAKE KIND OF A MILD TYPE TWO DIABEDES BUT CONABE YOU KNOW GETTIN ALONG YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH LIFE KOND IT MAYBE NOT EVEN REALIZING YOU KNOW AT FIRST AND SO WHEN YOUR DIAGNOSE WHATH TYPE TWO DIABEDES YOU'VE PROBABLY HAD SOME INSOLENT RESISTANCE FOR THE YEARS PRIOR TO YOUR DIAGNOSIS AND SO IN THAT CASE YOU OFTEN CAN HAVE A YOU KOW LIKE YOUARE YOU'RE AT HIGHER RISK FOR PRESENTING SOONER WITH THE THE COMPLICATIONS OF DIABEDES LIKE DIABETIC RATINOPATHY NOW A GIVEN THAT THE ACTUAL RATINOPATHY IS VERY SIMIL AR MAYBE THE SAME A BETWEEN TYPE ONE DIABEDES ANTYPE TWO DIABEDTES AND AGAIN IT INVOLVES THINGS LIKE LEAKY BLOOD VESSALS NEW BLOOD VESSAL GROWTH THERE'S SOME AMOUNT OF NERVED GENERAT DISFUNCTION THAT JUST SIMPLY OCCURS A SO SO A YOU CAN HAVE LITTLE LITTLE HEMERAGES OR BLEEDING SPOTS IN THE RATIN  TINY LITTLE STROKES OR MIKEREVASCULAR EVENTS IN THE RATIN A A SO THAT CAN HAPPEN IN EITHER TYPE ONE OR TYPE TW DIABETES ONCE YOU STAR D HAVING THE RATINOPATHE IT DOES LOOK PRETTY SIMILAR SO WHAT CAN PEOPLE DO TO PREVENT OR TREAT DIABETIC RETINOP AT THE OBVIOUSLY THE TYPE ONE DIABETIC NEEDS TO TAKE INSOLEN IN ORDER TO SURVIVE REALLY A TYPE TO DIABETICS NEED TO GET THEIR OBESITY UNDER CONTROL IF THEY ARE IN FACTOBES AND GET THEIR BLOODSHIRE LEVELS UNDER CONTROL A REGARDLESS THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AN BY EXTENSION ARE YOU SEEING ANY REDUCTIONS IN DIABETIC RETINOPATHY WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE TAKING THESE A GUCCUON LIKE TUPTIED MIMICS I'M LIKE OSEMPIC WHICH IS USED TO TREAT TYPE TO DIABEDES YET'S BEEN A VERY EXCITING DEVELOPMENT FOR THE DIABEDES FIELD A THIS NEW CLASS OF A VA A VA T ANTIDIABETIC DRUGS AND A SO ATHERE YOU'VE TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF EM THERE A FEW KEY THINGS A FOR REDUCING THE RISK OF DIABEDES OR THE IMPACT OF IABEDES ON YOUR RATINA ATHE RISK OF DIABETIC RATINOPATHE OR IMPACT OF DIABES ON YOUR RATNA AONE IS AS I MENTION GET REGULAR IEXAMS BE SCREENED I NOW ANY DIABATIC SHOULD BE SCREENED AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR A WITH A WITH A GOOD COMPREHENSIVE RATINAL EXAM LOOKING FOR ANY OF THESE A ITEMS THE NUMBER ONE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMEN TO PREVENT DIABETIC RATINOPATHY IS TO CONTROL YOUR DIABEDES AND HAVING A REAL GOOD BLOOD SUGAR CONTROL KEEPING YOUR HEMOGLOBE AN A ONE SEE WHICH IS ONE OF THE BLOOD TASTHA CETS USED TO MEASURE HAYOUR CIND A LONG TERMED DIABEDES MANAGEMENT IS GOWING A THAT'S REALLY AYOU ONT FIRST AND FOREMOST THE MOST IMPORTANT AND THAT'S BEEN SHOWN IN LARGE CLINICAL TRIALS THEY ACTUALLY RANDAMIZED PATIENCS TO HAY TAKE CARE YOUR DIABEDES OR DO A REAL GOOD JOB TAKING CARE OF YOUR DIABEDES AND THE PATIENTS WHO DO THE REAL GOOD JOB TAKING CARE OF THEIR DIABEDES HAVE MUCH LASS DIABETIC RATI OPATHE SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE IT TURNS OUT THAT IF YOU HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND DIABETES THAT BLOOD PRESSURE IS ALSO REALLY DAMAGING TO YOUR RATINA ALSO BY THE WAY THE KIDNES AND PROBABLY ALL THE OTHER ORGANS THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM THE DIABETIC INSULT SO IN ADDITION TO CONTROLLING BLOOD SUGAR REALLY IMPORTANT HAVE BLOOD PRESSURE UNDER GREAT CONTROL NOW BOTH BLOOD SUGAR AND BLOOD PRESSURE INTYPE TOO DIABATICS ESPECIALLY IF YOUR CATCHING THEM EARLY CAN BE IMPROVED WITH SOME OF THESE YOU KNOW SO CALLED LIFE STYLE CHANGES LIKE IMPROVING ETING WATCHING WHAT YOUR FOOD IN TAKE IS YOU KNOW GETTING GOOD EXERCISE TRYING TO LOSE WEIGHT A SO THESE ARE DEFINITELY ON THAT LIST OF HOW DO YOU GET TO GOOD BLOOD SUGAR AND BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY BLOOD SUGAR AND BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL RIGHT AT THE TOP AND THEN ALSO INCLUDING THE REGULAR AT LEAST ANNUAL EXAMS AND THEN IF DIABETICRATINOPATHY IS DETECTED AND BLOOD SUGAR AND BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL ARE NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH FOR THAT PATION WE DO HAVE TREATMENTS AS I MENTION BEFORE THEIR DRUGS THAT CAN BE INJECTED IF YOUR RETAN IS GETTING YOU KNOW KIND OF WEAKY BLOOD VESSALS FROM DIABETES ITHER THERE ARE TREATMENTS THAT WE CAN GIVE THE EYE SPECIFICALLY TO TRY TO COUNTER THE DIABETICGRATANOPATHE TERRIFIC AND TERMS OF GLACOMA AS YOU MENTIONED GLACOMA IS RELATED TO PRESSURE ALTHOUGH THERE IS PRESSURE NORMAL GLACOMA GLACOMA IS A DEATH OF THE RETNAL GANGLING CELLS THE NURONS THAT CONNECT THE EYE TO THE BRAIN AND ONCE THEY ARE GONE AT LEAST TOF THIS POINT IN HUMAN HISTORY THEY CAN'T BE REPLACED ALTHEUGH HOPEFULLY BECAUSE OF WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE IND THE OTHER LABORATORIES ARE DOING AT SOME POINT THAT STATEMENT I JUST MADE WILL NOT BE TRUE IN THE ARGISEES CAN BE REPLACED MEANWHILE WHAT CAN AND SHOULD PEOPLE DO TO FIND OUT IF THEY HAVE GLAUCOMA AND TO TREAT GLAUCOMA AND IS IT TRUE THAT EVEN IF SOMEBODY HAS NORMAL PRESSURE THAT LOWERING THEIR EYE PRESSURE FURTHER PROTECTS THEM AGAINST GLAUCOMA YE THAT'S ABSOLUTY RIGHT SO MOST IMPORTANT IS TO GET SCREENED WITH A FORMAL EXAM AT YOUR APTOMATRIST OR OPTHEMOLOGIST BECAUSE YOU YOU WON'T NOTICE YOU WON'T HAVE ANY SYMPTOMS IF YOUR EE PRESSURE IS TOO HEYE YOU WON'T NOTE YOU'RE NOT LIKELY TO NOTICE UNTIL VERY LATE IN THE DISEASE IF YOUR PERIFERAL VISION IS BEING DAMAGED THROUGH THE COURSE OF GLAUCOMA SO MOST IMPORTANT AS HAVIC SCREENING EXAMINE GOOD COMPRERHENTS OF SCREENING EXAM WELL ALWAYS INCLUDE CHECKING THE EYH PRESSURES AND ALSO LOOKING IN THE BACK OF YOUR EYE THE HEAD OF THE OPTIC NERVE WHERE ALL THE FIBERS LEAVE THE EYE AND CARRY THE OPTIC NERVOF INFORMATION BACK TO THE BRAIN WE CAN SEE THAT WHEN WE LOOK INSIDE YOUR EYE AND AN AND GLAUCOMA HAS A FAIRLY CHARACTERISTIC LOOK TO IT IN THE OPTIC NERVE HAD SO SO LOOKING AT THE OPTIC NERVE HAD WE HAVE IMAGING AND PERIFERAL VISION TASTING THAT CAN ALSO BE INCLUDED IN THE SCREENING EXAMS SO IF YOU REALLY GET A COMPREHENTS OF SCREENING EXAM YOU CAN VERY RELIABLY DETECT IF YOU HAVE GLAUCOMA TO WORRY ABOUT OR YOU'RE IN THE CLEAR IF YOU HAVE GLALCOMA TO WORRY ABOUT WE HAVE TREATMENTS AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WHETHER YOU START WITH A ABNORMALLY HIGH PRESSURE OR YOU START WITH A PRESSURE THAT'S ON THE FACE OF IT IN THE NORMAL RANGE IN EITHER CASE LOWERING THE PRESSURE HAS BEEN SHOWN IN LARGE PROPERLY CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS TO SLOW THE PROGRESSION OF OPTIC NERVE DAMAGE AND VISION LOSS SO ABSOLUTELY IN EITHER CASE STARTING WITH HIGH PRESSURE OR STARTING WITH NORMAL PRESSURE IN EITHER CASE YOU'VE GOT A LOWER THE PRESSURE FURTHER AND AS I MENTION WE HAVE EYEDROPS THATS ARE USUALLY THE FIRST LINE THERE'S VERY GOOD DATA THAT THERE'S A VERY BUT NINE NON IN VASOF LAZER IT'S NOT THE SAME KIND OF LAZER THAT GETS USED FOR LASICK BUT THERE'S A BENINE VERY SAFE TYPE OF LAZER CALLED SELECT OF LAZER TRIBACULA PLASTY AS ALT WE CALL IT AND THAT'S ALSO VERY EFFECTIVE AS A FIRST LINE ACTUALLY IN THE LARGEST CLINICAL TRIAL FROM WHICH THE DATA HAVE BEEN COMING OUT JUST EVEN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IS CALLED THE LIGHT TRIAL AIN THE LIGHT TRIAL PATIENCE WITH GLALCOMA RANDOM LAY ASSIGNED TO EITHER GET THE LAZER OR THE SORT OF MOST COMMON FIRST STRONGEST EYEDROP AND AH THAT GETS USED CLENICALLAY AND ACTUALLY ON MANY FEATURES THEY BOTH WORKED AT LEAST AS WELL BUT WHEN LOOKING OUT OVER THE LONGTURM ACTUALLY THE LAZER HAD SOME ADVANTAGES OVER THE EYEDROP NOT IN THE LEAST OF WHICH BY THE WAY IT'S VERY NICE FOR PATIENTS NOT AF TE LIKE REMEMBER TO USE THE EYEDROP EVERY NIGHT AND SO I'M SO THAT'S QUITE HELPFUL I THINK A TO TO KEEP IN MIND AS A TREATMENT OPTION A EARLY IN THE COURSE OF THE DISEASE OF COURSE IF THE EYEDROPS AND OR LAZERS ARE NOT ENOUGH EARLY IN THE DISEASE WE ALSO HAVE SURGICAL APPROACHES TO LOWER THE EYEPRESSURE FURTHER YOU KNOW EVEN WITH ALL OF OUR TREATMENTS ALL OF THESE TREATMENTS STAPPING PATIENTS THROUGH ALL OF THIS ABOUT TEN FIFTEEN EVEN TWENTY PERCENT OF PATIENTS WILL LOSE VERY MEANINGFUL FUNCTIONAL VISION AND MAYBE FIVE TEN FIFTEEN PER CENT OF PATIENTS ESPECIALLY DEPENDING WERE YOU ON IN THE WORLD WILL WILL GO BLIND FROM GLAUCOMA A INCLUDING IN YOU KNOW QUOT ON QUOTE DEVELOPED CONTRIES A THERE'S STILL A VERY SIGNIFICANT COHORT OF PATIENCE THAT GO BLIND A LEGALLY BLIND AND THEN YOU KNOW ABSOLUTE BLINDNESS LIKE CAN'T EVEN TELL OF THE LIGHTS ARE ON IN THE ROOM AH SO IT'S IT'S IT'S DEVISTATING IT'S INSIDIOUS IT'S HARD TO DETECT EARLY A AND A SO KLAUCOMA'S STILL A TOUGH ONE EVEN WITH ALL OF THE TREATMENTS THAT WE HAVE ASS YO GET YOUR P RESSURES CHECKED FOLKS AND IF YOU ARE PRESCRIBED DROPS TAKE YOUR DROPS I HEAR ABOUT PATIENCE NOT TAKING THEIR DROPS WHICH TO ME JUST SEEMS BAFFLING BUT I GUESS HAVING TO DO SOMETHING DAY IN AND DAY OUT IS CAN BE TROUBLESOME ENOUGH THAT UNLESS PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEIR VISION VERY QUICKLY OR THEY ARE VERY AFRAID OF LOSING THEIR VISIONS SOMETIMES THEY JUST NEGLECT TO TAKE THEM IT'S HARD IT'S HARD FOR GLALCOMA EYEDROPS IS HARD FOR TAKING YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE MADICATION IT'S HARD FOR A LOT OF MEDICINES YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE TAKING A MEDICINE WHERE YOU DON'T FEEL BETTER YOU KNOW FYOU HAVE A HEADACHE AND YOU TAKE AN ASPERAN OR TILAN ALL OR N I BEPROFIND AH YOU KNOW YOU FEEL BETTER YOU FEEL REENFORCE SCOTCH TAKING THAT PILL MADE SENTS RIGHT AH BUT IF YOU'RE USING AN EYEDROP THAT LIKE HAY THERE'S GOING TO PROTECT YOU FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS FROM LOSING YOUR VISION BUT YOU DON'T NOTICE EVERY DAY THAT ANYTHING'S BATTER AND BY THE WAY THE EYEDROPS COULD BE A LITTLE IRRITATING MAY BE IT STINGS A LITTLE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO WHEN YOU PUT IT IN YOUR EYE SOME PEOPLE ARE EVEN LESS TOLERANT OF THE EYEDROPS IT'S HARD TO FEEL MOTIVATED EVERY DAY AND WE KNOW THAT WE CALL THAT COMPLIANCE WE KNOW THAT IT'S VERY HARD FOR PATIENCE TO STAY COMPLYIN WITH PRESCRIBED MEDICATIONS WHERE THEY DON'T FEEL OR NOTICE A DIFFERENCE IN A DAILYWAY I REALIZE THAT WE CAN'T STOP AGING YET AH BUT RIGHT NOW YOU CAN STOP AGING IN AGE IS A RISPACTOR FOR GLALCOMA MINOR SINI IS SO IS SMOKING OR VAPING NICOTING AND SO IS ALCOHOL AND BY THAT REASONING SHOULD PEOPLE STRIVE TO DRINK LESS AND SMOKE LESS INCLUDING VAPING NICOTIN LESS IF THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT GLALCOMA YA AND NOT JUST GLAVCOMIMACULAR DEGENERATION ACTUALLY MACA GENERATION AS A COUPLE MAJOR RISFACTORS MACCA GENERATION AGING JUST LIKE WITH GLALCOMA MAJOR RISFACTOR SMOKING INCLUDING EXPOSURE TO SECOND HAND SMOKE M AGYOUR RISFACTOR FOR MAKA TOGENERATIEN AND FOR THE PROGRESSION AND VISION LOSS POTENTIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH MACUA DEGENERATION IN THE CASE A MACO GENERATION TERE'S ALSO A COUPLE OF GENES THAT WEV SEQUENCE THE HUMAN GENOM AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF GENES ASSOCIATED WITH MACULA GENERATION TOO THAT'S LESS TRUE FOR YOUR TYPICAL RUN OF THE MILL ADULT KLAUCOMA THERE ARE GENES FOR THE PEDIATRIC AND INFANTILE FORMS OF GLAUKOMA A SO YOU SMOKING A HUNDRED PER SEN INCLUDING VAPING A IT'S A NONO FOR YOUR EYES JUST LIKE IT'S O NONOUGH FOR THE RASTOOUR BODY AND A IT'S TOUGH IS THE E DOCTOR TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIENTS WITH PATIENTS CAUSE YOU KIND O FEEL LIKE WELL YOU KNOW THEY MUST KNOW IT ALL READY AND I'M TRYING TO BE THE GOOD GUY IN THE ROOM WITH THE PATIENT CONVINCE THEM TO USE THEIR OTHER MEDICATIONS BUT IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ASE ALSO AS I CARE PROVIDERS TO REENFORCE THE MESSAGE WITH OUR PATIENTS A SMOKING TERRIBLE IDEA AH FOR MAKA GENERATION ALSO FOR GLAKOMA YOU KNOW GLAUCOMA'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THE OPTIC NERVE WERE IT DEGENERATES GINT O RIGHT AT THE HEAD OF THE OPTIC NERVE WHERE IT WHERE IT EXITS THE EYE IT'S WHAT WE CALL A WATER SHEDZONE IT'S KIND OF IT EDGE OF TWO BLOOD VESSELS SUPPLIES AND IF EITHER OF THOSE BLOOD VESSELS SUPPLIES OR A LITTLE BIT SHORT ON BLOOD OR OXYGENS SUPPLY TO THAT OPTIC NERVE HAD YOURE GLAUCOMA 'S GOING TO GET WORSE YOUR OPTIC NERVES CAN BE UNDER FAD AND THAT'S GOING TO WORSE IN THIS DEGENERATIVE PROCESS JUST BY NOT HAVING ALL THE RIGHT NEUTRIENTS AND OXYGEN SO THE OTHER THING IS THAT ESPECIALLY FOR GLAUCOMA EVERYTHING THAT WE TALK ABOUT FOR BEING HEART HEALTHY FOR THE REST OF OUR BODY IS IS ALMOST CERTAINLY TRUE FOR GLAUCOMA AND SO I ALSO ALWAYS COUNSEL GLAUCMA PATIENTS IT'S NOT JUST NO SMOKING BUT EAT HEALTHY HAVEAMULTIVIDAMEN A GETS SOME EXERCISE ALL THOSE THINGS THAT ARE GOOD FOR YOUR PARTYOVASCULAR SYSTEM ARE GOIN TO BE GOOD FOR YOUR EYES IN GENERAL AND IMPETICULAR IF YOU HAVE GLAUCOMA AH O'RE AT RISK HI RISK FOR G LALCOMA I REALIZE THAT SMOKING OR VAPING ARE PROBLEMATIC FOR GLALCOMA AND FOR MACULAR DEGENERATION BUT WE CAN'T HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT KLALCOMA WITHOUT ETLEAST MENTIONING CANABAS I DIDN'T ENTIRE EPISODE ABOUT CANABAS WHICH TOUCHED ON SOME OF THE REAL DANGERS OF VERY HIGH TH  CONCENTRATION CANABAS THIS LOST ME A FEW UM FOLLOWERS I'M SURE NO PROBLEM BECAUSE WHAT WAS IMPORTANT WAS TO CONVEY THE FACT THAT THE CANABAS IT'S OUT THERE NOWADAYS COMES IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT STRAINS AND RATIOS OF T H C TO S BTEITHERS SOME SEVERE RISKS OF HIGH TH C ESPECIALLY IN YOUNG MALES ALTHOUGH NOT ALWAYS THE POINT BEING THAT THERE ARE I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS BECAUSE FOR WHATEVE REASON CANABAS GETS PEOPLE REALLY UP IN ARMS THAT WE SAITES NOT AS BAD AS ALCOL BUT GESS WHAT WE DIDN'T ENTIRE UPSODE ABOUT ALCOHOL AND THERE THE MESSAGES VERY CLEAR ZERO IS BETTER THAN ANY AND TO A WEEK IS PROBABLY THE LIMIT NIF YOU'RE NALCOHOLIC ZERO IS THE RULE SO WITH CANABAS IT'S CLEAR BY MY READ OF THE DATA THAT IT CANN LOWER EYE PRESSURE WHICH MAY UNDERMIND THE PROGRESSION OF GLALCOMA SOMEWHAT BUT IF PEOPLE ARE SMOKING THAT CANABAS IS IT THEREFORE GOING TO OFFSET ANY GAIN THAT ONE WOULD GET FROM THAT CANABAS AND THEN HOW DOES ONE ACCOUNT FOR THE POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC ASPECTS OF VERY HIGH TH C CANABAS Y IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND THE TRUTH IS S THAT IN MOST PATIENCE CANABAS WILL LOWER THE EYE PRESSURE THE PROBLEM IS THAT REALLY ONLY LOWERS THAT IGH PRESSURE DURING THE PERIOD THAT YOUR HIGH FROM THE CANABAS AND THE SECOND PROBLEM IS THAT SMOKING VERSION OF GETTING THAT CANABAS INTO YOUR SYSTEM THE SMOKING IS BAD FOR YOUR LONGS BY THE WAY THE SMOKE FROM CANABAS OR FROM CIGARETES IS ALSO TERRIBLE FOR YOUR DRY EYES I CAUSEIS INFLAMMATION IT DRIES OUT YOUR EYES SO IT'S ALSO VERY BAD FROM THAT PRERSPECTIVE NOW SO THE PROMLE WITH CANABAS IS NOT THAT IT DOESN'T WORK TO LOWER THE PRT WE WANT A LOVER THE PRESSURE THAT'S GREAT THE PROM WITH CANABAS IS THAT IT'S NOT REALISTIC FOR MOST OF OUR PATIENTS TO PRESCRIBE COULD YOU GO OUT AND BE HIGH FROM CANABAS TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS UM SURE SOME PEOPLE HAVE TRIED AND SUCCEEDED IM BUT RIGHT THAT'S NOT PRACTICAL IER MOST PEOPLE END CERTAINLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IT CON BE REALLY ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC YE SOULS THAT ABSOLUTELY SO SO I RECOMMEND NOT TAKING THAT APPROACH BUT THAT SAID I IAM DEFFLY NOT A DECRIER OF IT AND NOW THAT THERE ARE ADIBLE FORMS I CERTAINLY HAVE PATIENTS WHO ARE USING IT IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY AESPECIALLY ADIBLE FORMS AND AND IN SELECT CASES LIKE THAT COULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE FOR THEM HELPING TO KEEP THE PRESSURE DOWN AND I'LL SAY FOR EXAMPLE IT OW TURNS OUT YOU'VE TALKED A LOT OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS ABOUT DIEARNAL CURVES AND CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS IT TURNS OUT THAT OR I PRESSURE ALSO UNDERGOES THE CIRCADIAN RHYTHM ND AS ACTUALLY HIGHEST AT NIGHT WHILE WE'RE SLEEPING KIND OF PEIKES IN THOSE EARLY MORNING HOURS THAND HIT'S A LOW THROUGHOUT THE EARLY DAY AND THEN CON ARISES AGAIN THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING AND A WE HAVE A LOT OF PATIENTS WHO THEY COME INTO THE CLINIC VISIT THEIR EYE PRESSURE LOOKS NORMAL BUT IS ACTUALLY QUITE ABIT HIGHER WHEN THEY ARE AT HOME AND THAT COULD EXPLAIN SOME FRACTION OF WHAT WE CALL NORMAL PRESSURE GLOKOMA IT JUST LOOKS NORMAL DURING THE DAY IT'S ACTUALLY HIGH AT NIGHT AND SO IN PARTICULAR SOME PATIENTS I CERTAINLY HAVE SOME PATIENTS WHO ARE USING THESE PRODUCTS LIKE THAT SAY BEFORE BAD AND IF IT'S CONTROLLING THEIR EYE PRESSURE AT NIGHT WHILE THEY'RE ASLEEP WHEN THE EE PRESSURE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE HIGHEST IT MAY CONFER SOME PROTECTIVE ADVANTAGE OVER TIME BUT THAT'S THAT I AGAIN LIKE FOR MOST PATIENTS IS NO A ME THE PRIMARY APPROACH I'M MOST EXCITED ABOUT THE IDEA OF I'M IU KNOW LABORATORIES OR COMPANY'S FIGURING OUT WHICH THE COMPOUNDS WITHIN THESE A CANABINOIDS THEY'RE CALLED WITHIN THESE PRODUCT S ARE ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR LOWERING THE EYE PRESSURE AND COULD WE GET LIKE A MORE POTENT I SPECIFIC LONG ACTING DROG THAT'S PASICALLY DERIVED FROM THE CONCEPT OF CANABAS BUT WORKS BETTER AND IS MORE COMPATIBLE WITH NOT BRINGING ALONG ALL THE OTHER ADVERSE ELEMENTS THAT CAN COME WITH CANABAS USE YOU MENTION THE CIRCADEAN RHYTHM AND IY PRESSURE AND THE FACT THAT I PRESSURE IS HIGHER AT NIGHT IS THERE ANY ADVANTAGE TO SLEEPING IN A PARTICULAR POSITION I KNOTICE MY SOUND A LITTLE DETAIL BUT I SEEM TO RECALL AND ABSTRACT HOR A PAPER A FEW YEARS AGO TO MEETING THAT YOU AND I BOTH ATTENDED WHAT THAT SAID THAT IF PEOPLE SLEPT WITH THEIR HEAD BELOW THEIR FEET A I PRESSURES WERE HIGHER THAN IF THEIR HEAD WAS SLIGHTLY ELEVATED ABOVE THEIR FEET AND FOR SOMEBODY WHO HAS GLALCOMA THIS COULD MAKE PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE AND TERMS OF THEIR EYE PRESSURES AT PRECISELY THE HOURS OF THE NIGHT WE SHOULD SAY IN WHICH THEY COULD BE DOING THE MOST DAMAGE TO THE GANGLY INSELF YA IT ABSOLUTELY AND WE WILL SOMETIMES COUNSEL PATIENCE WITH SEVERE GLAUCOMA ESPECIALLY IF THERE YOU KNOW POORLY RESPONSIVE TO STANDARD THARAPES OR POORLY ABLE TO TOLERATE STANDARD THARAPES WELL COUNSEL THEM IF THEY'RE ABLE TO SLEEP UP ON A COUPLE PILLOWS GET KIND OF A THIRTY DEGREES SLEEP ANGLE GOWING WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO IS INTERFERE WITH THE PERSON SLEEP BECAUSE I JUST FUNDAMENTALLY FEEL FOR THE TOTAL HEALTH OF THE WHOLE HUMAN BEING GETTING A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP IS MAY BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT THIRTY DEGREES AND IF TRYING TO SLEEP UP ON PILLOWS AT THIRT DEGREES IS GOING TO LEAT TO CON A RESTLESS DIFFICULT SLEEP NIGHT I'D RATHER THE PATIENT GET A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP BUT IF THEY CAN TOLERATE IT AND ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE A SORT OF A A TOUGH VERSION OF GLAUCOMA THAND IWILL WILL WILL LET THEM TRY SEE IF THEY CAN SLEEP O THE OTHER REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION THAT ARISES IS A DOES WHICH SIDE YOU SLEEP ON A FACT AH AT WHICH I MIGHT HAVE WORSE GLALCOMA GALCOMA IS ALMOST ALWAYS ITH WITH A FEW RARE EXCEPTIONS ALMOST ALWAYS A DISEASE OF TWO EYES BUT IT CAN PRESENT VERY ASYMMETRICALLY IN FACT IT'S QUITE COMMON HAVE ONE EYE KIN HAVE WORSE DAMAGE THAN THE OTHER AND AND WE DON'T KNOW FUNDAMENTALLY WHY THAT IS BUT ONE HYPOTHESIS WIT SCOTCH MAYBE IF YOU SLEEP ON THE RIGHT EYE A THEN YOUR RIGHT EYE WHIVE WORSE LALCUMAC AS THE PRESSURE'S LITTLE HIGHER DOWN BELOW OR MAYBE IT'S PRESSING ON THE PILLOW IN A WAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLES STUDIES REALLY REALLY LOOKING AT THAT QUESTION A COUPLE STUDIES HAVE SAID THE LOWER I'LL HAVE WORSE CLALCUMA COUPLE STUDIES HAVE SAID THE HIGHER EYE WILL HAVE WORSE CLALCUMA SO THE UPSHOT IS THAT PROBABLY DOESN'T MATTER WHICH SIDE YOU SLEEP ON WE ALSO KNOW WHEN UVIDIO PEOPLE IN THEIR NORMAL SLEEP PATTERN EVEN IF YOU FEEL YOU ALWAYS FALL ASLEEP ON THE LEFT SIDE OF YOUR FACE PEOPLE TOSS AND TURN ALL NIGHT PROBABLY OVER THE COURSE THE NIGHT YOU'R SPENDING A SIMILAR AMOUNT OF TIME ON EACH EYE THAT YOU BROUGHT UP THAT POINT IN TERMS OF MACULAR DEGENERATION I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO AS SOPPOSED TO THE DON'TS IN ORDER TO PERHAPS OFFSET MACULAR DEGENERATION ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M ENTREAT BY ARE THE RESULTS OF GLEN GEFFREY'S LABORATORY OVER UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON I HAD KNOWN JEFF FOR PROBABLY A DECATOR MORE AN HE TYPICALLY WORKED ON ANIMAL MODELS BUT THEN A FEW YEARS AGO STARTED PUBLISHING STUDIES AND I BELIEVE THERE NOW TWO PUBLISH STUDIES SHOWING HOW RED LIGHT EXPOSURE AND NEAR INFOR RED LIGHT EXPOSURE DONE EARLY IN THE DAY TO THE EYE AT A DISTANCE OF ABOUT TWO FEET FOR JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES A FEW TIMES A WEEK COULD OFFSET SOME OF THE VISION LOSS ASSOCIATE WITH ATRELAT DIMACULAR DEGENERATION IN PEOPLE OLDER THAN FORTY THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THESE STUDIES AND THERE'S A THEORY THERE ABOUT INHANCING FUNCTION OF MY OCONDRE AND PHOTORACEPTORIS BY REDUCING REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES THERE'S ALL MECHANISTIC HYPOTHESIS BUT MY CUSHION IS IS THAT THE SORT OF PROTOCAL THAT PRODUCES SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH OFFSET OF MACULAR DEGENERATION LIKE WE SHOULD ALL BE LOOKING AT REDLIGHTS IN THE MORNING IAM OR IS IT STILL TOO EARLY DAYS IN ORDER TO REALLY CONCLUDE THAT II THINK THE DATA IS VERY COMPELLING THE DATA ARE VALAT VERY COMPELLING THAT THIS KIND OF RED OR NEAR INFERRED LIGHT THERAPE A CAN BE AT SOME LEVEL NER PROTECTIVE AND YASA THE THE DATA SUGGEST THAT A COND OF RAMPING UP I HI FUNCTIONING MIT A CONJURY IS A PART OF THAT  ACTIVATING NUR PROTECTIVE PATHWAYS IN THE RATINA IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN ANIMAL MODELS AND A LITTLE HUMAN DATA HERE AND THERE BUT BOTH FOR MACUA DEGENERATION KIND OF A DEGENERATIVE IS BUT ALSO FOR OPTICNOROPATHES YELINA LIKE LACOMAN RATINAL GANGLEAN CELLS THE CELLS THAT CARRY ALL THAT VISUAL INFORMATION FROM THE EYE OF THE BRAIN THEY'RE CHOCKFUL O MITO CONJURY A TOO AND AND SO THE IDEA THAT THIS COULD BE A THERAPEUTIC APPROACH I THINK IT'S VERY COMPELLING THERE ARE NUMBER OF STUDIES ACTUALLY THINK STILL ON GOING TO DAY REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE RIGHT DOSE HOW MUCH BRIGHTNESS DO YOU NEED IS THERE AN OPTIMAL WAVEFLANGTH HOW MANY MINUTES DOES IT MATTER WHEN DURING THE DAY YOU PROVIDE THAT LIGHT OR HOW MANY MINUTES OR HOURS A THESE ARE STILL VERY MUCH OPEN QUESTIONS YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE DOSE WHAT'S THE DELIVERY A BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S VERY PROMISING LOOKING AND THERE'S BIOLOGICAL PREMIS AND I'M EXCITED TO SEE WHERE THAT GOES BECAUSE AGAIN THAT'S LIKE A THAT'S A VERY ACCESSIBLE A AT SORT OF VERAPEUTIC APPROACH THAT COULD BE BROUGHT TO A VERY BROAD SWATH  OF PEOPLE SO AN I'M EXLY LATED ABOUT THAT SORI ADAN MEANS INTER UP AND COMPLETELY NON IN VASIVE IM I SHOULD AM PROBABLY MENTION A WARNING WHICH IS IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DECIDE THAT THE'E GOIN TO JUMP ON THIS RESULT AND DO REDLIGHT EXPOSURE IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY NO MATTER WHAT COLOR A LIGHT IS IF IT'S TOO BRIGHT YOU CAN DAMAGE YOUR EYE SO THAT I THINK THIS IS WHY OUR POINT ON THE FACT THAT WE NEED ESTABLISHED PROTOCALS AM BEFORE PEOPLE REALLY START BLASTING THEIR EYES WITH RED LIGHT AND IF THEY ARE GOING TO EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO RED LIGHT IT SHOULDN'T BE UN COMFORTABLY BRIGHT TO HAVE THAT  THAT'S UBSILY RIGHT YOU KNOW ACTUALLY A LIGHT A FACT IM WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTL ABOUT EARLIER I'M THERE'S ACTUALLY NOW DATA ALSO THAT RED LIGHT AND ACTUALLY INTERESTINGLY STUDIES USING LIGHT AT THE OTHER END OF THE VISIBLE SPACTRUM VIOLET LIGHT EITHER OF THOSE IN SMALL DAILY DOSES CAN ALSO BE USED TO PREVENT PROGRESSION OF NEAR SIGHTEDNESS IN CHILDREN IN SCHOOL AGED CHILDRON AND SO I THINK WE'RE REALLY JUST ON THE COSP OF REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE BIOLOGY OF HOW THESE DIFFERENT LIGHT THRAPEES MIGHT BE LAVERAGED MAXIMALY TO TOMAXIMIZE OUR I HEALTH AND BOTH DURING DEVELOPMENT AND AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPACTRUM  AS WE AGE I'M SO IT'S AN EXCITING ARE AND I THINK THIS KIND OF PHOTOTHERAPY IS A YOU KNOW I A VERY HOT TOPIC FOR RESEARCH RAIT NOW VERY HOT TOP ONE HAS TO WONDER WHETHER R NOT THESE LIGHT THERAPEES THE FACT THAT INFORED WORKS AND MAY BE ULTURA VIOLET WORKS IS A REALLY JUST CAPTURING SOME OF WHAT SUNLIGHT IS NATURALLY DOING WHEN AS YOU MENTION BEFORE A CHILD OR PERHAPS IN ADULT ALL SUSPENDS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS OUTDOORS AND ME MAY WE'RE JUST FILLING IN THE BLANKS THAT ARE NEGLECTED NOWADAYS BECAUSE WERE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME INDOORS UNDER ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS AND IN FRONT OF SCREENS  A AR VY A VERY THOUGHTFUL POSSIBILITY A I HAVE A COUPLE OF WE DON'T HAVE TO CALL THEM QUICK QUESTIONS BUT COMMON QUESTIONS THAT PERHAPS HAVE A BRIEF A EXPLANATIONS A FOR INSTANCE I PUT OUT A REQUEST FOR QUESTIONS IN A ANTICIPATION OF THIS EPISODE AND I GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE ASKING WHAT ARE FLOATERS IN THE EYE AND IS THERE ANYTHING THAT PEOPLE CAN DO TO GET RID OF FLOATERS A ARE ARE I WHEN WE'RE BORN IS ACTUALLY FILLED IN THE MIDDLE OF IT WITH A A JALLY IT'S NOT JUST FLU IT IT'S KIND OF A JELLY THERE'S COLLEGE AND FIBRS AND THANKFULLY THE WHOLE JELLY IS LARGELY INVISIBLE SO THE LIGHT CAN GET THROUGH OUR EYBACK TO THE RATNA WITHOUT BEING IMPEDED AS WE AGE THOSE DIFFERENT FIBRS AND JELLS SHRINK AND CONSHRACT AND THEY PEEL OFF OF THE BACK OF THE RATINE SO THERE'S JUST IN THE IDDLE NAGOUR YOUR YOUR EYEBALL DOESN'T SHRINK BECAUSE IT FILLS IN WITH WITH FLUID WITH SALT WATER BASICALLY BUT THE JELL PART SHRINKS AND AS IT SHRINKS AND ALSO PULLS PEALS OFF THE RATINA A IT CAN PULL OFF IND OF LITTLE TINY RATINAL BITS NOT IMPORTANT YOUR VISION BITS BUT JUST LIKE LITTLE TISSUEBITS AND ALSO AS IT CAN JEALS IT KIND OF A CAN GET LITTLE CONCRETIONS IN THE JELLY AND WE PERCEIVE THOSE AS FLOATERS YOU KNOW LITTLE ALMOST SEMITRANSLUCENT OR IN SOME CASES KONA GRAYISH BLACKISH SOMETIMES SOMETIMES HE GET A BIG ONE IF IT PEELS OFF THE EDGE OF TE OPTIC NERVE IN THE BACK OF THE EYE AS HAPPENS WE CALL THAT A POSTERIOR VITRIOS DETACHMENT HE GED ACTUALLY SEE LIKE A MOON OR A HALF MOONFLOATER AH IN YOUR VISION THESE ARE VERY FRUSTRATING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE AM AND A THE GOOD NEWS IS IN ALMOST ALL CASES THEY WILL JUST GO AWAY BY THEMSELVES IN TEORY IT'S BEEN PLAYED WITH GOSH WE COULD DO LIKE A BIG SURGEREDA SHEW UP ALL THAT JLLY REPLACE AT ALL WITH SALT WATER TRY TO GET RID OF YOUR FLOATERS THERE'S RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SURGER WE USE IT VERY EFFECTIVELY AN RATINAL DETACHMENTS OR OTHER DISEASES BAD DIBETIC RATINA BUT THE BLEEDING INSIDE THE EYE WE CAN TAKE OUT THE JELLY FROM THE EYE REPLACE IT WITH WITH WITH SALT WATER A BUT THAT'S NOT I'M YOU KNOW PUTTING PATIENTS THROUGH THE RISK OF THAT SURGERY JUST TO GET RID OF A COUPLE OF FLOATERS OR FEW FLOATERS THAT PROBABLY ARE GING TO GO AWAY OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS I ACTUALLY LIKE TO TELL PATIENTS IT'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT JUST IGNORE THEM AND ACTUALLY IF YOU STOP FOCUSING ON THEM YOUR BRAIN WILL ACTUALLY START FILTERING THEM OUT YOU'LL STOP NOTICING THEM IF YOU CAN KIND OVA NOT WORRY ABOUT THEM BE A LITTLE INTENTIONAL ABOUT IGNORING THEM IN THE BEGINNING AND THEN THEY DO ACTUALLY GO AWAY AND LOOK SOMEILL GO AWAY THESE THREE'LL GO AWAY THESE TWO WILL APPEAR EVENTUALLY YOU'LL STOP HAVING FLOATERS MOST PATIENTS WILL STOP HAVING FLOATERS AH SO WE REALLY DON'T LIKE TO PUT A PATION AT RISK BY INTERVENING

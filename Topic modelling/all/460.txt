WHELCOME TO THE UBERMENSCIENCESCIENCE PACETOI AM ENDRHUBERMEN AND O'M RO PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TODAY MY GUEST IS DOCTOR EMILY BALCHEDDUS DOCTOR BALCHEDISIS A PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY HER LABORATORY STUDIES MOTIVATION GOAL SETTING AND TOOLS FOR SUCCESSFUL GOAL COMPLETION I LEARNED ABOUT DOCTOR BALCHEDIS'S WORK SOME YEARS AGO BECAUSE I'M A VISION SCIENTIST THAT IS I STUDY THE VISUAL SYSTEM AND I HEARD ABOUT THIS INCREDIBLE PSYCHOLOGIST AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY WHO WAS STUDYING HOW VISION THAT IS HOW WE VISUALIZE PROBLEMS CAN PREDICT WHETHER R NOT WE SUCCESSFULLY OVERCOME CHALLENGES AND HOW WE STRATAGIZE IN ORDER TO SET AND MEET GOALS AND IN TWENTY TWENTY I LEARND OF DOCTOR BALCHEDDUS'S BOOK WHICH WAS WRITTEN FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC ENTITLED CLEARER CLOSE OR BETTER HOW SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE SEE THE WORLD AND I READ BOTH THE HARD COPY OF THE BOOK AND LISTEN TO THE AUDIO BOOK AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE MATERIAL AS YOU'LL LEARN DIRECTLY FROM DOCTOR BALCHEDDUS TO DAY HOW PEOPLE VISUALIZE A PROBLEM THAT IS WHETHE OR NOT THEY THINK OF A GOAL OR A PROBLEM AS RESIDING AT THE TOP OF A VERY STEEP HILL OR ON THE TOP OF A SHALLOWER HILL OR WHETHER OR NOT THEY VISUALIZE A GOAL OR A PROBLEM AS FAR OFF IN THE DISTANCE OR CLOSER TO THEM IN THE DISTANCE VISUALLY IN THEIR MIND STRONGLY DICTATES WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL ARRIVE AT THE CHALLENGE OF MEETING A GOAL WER OVERCOMING A PROBLEM WITH MORE ENERGY OR LESS ENERGY INDEED IT DICTATES WHETHE R NOT THEY CAN PUSH TO IMMEDIATE MILESTONES OR WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL THINK THEY HAVE TO OVERCOME THE ENTIRE TASK ALL AT ONCE BASICALLY DOCTOR BALCHEDDUS'S WORK HAS DISCOVERED THAT HOW WE VISUALIZE A PROBLEM OR A GOAL IN OUR MIND HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH HOW WE LEAN INTO THAT GOAL WHETHE OR NOT WE THINK OF IT IS OVERWHELMING OR TRACTABLE WHETHER OR NOT WE THINK THAT WE CAN OVERCOME THAT GOAL AND THEN IT WILL LEAD TO YET MORE POSSIBLE REWARDS IN GOALS OR WHETHEROR NOT WE FEEL THAT WE ARE GOING TO ARRIVE AT THE FINISH LINE AD THAN JUST BE OVERWHELMED WITH FATIGUE IN OTHER WORDS HOW YOU VISUALIZE THINGS IN YOUR MIND AND WHEN I SAY VISUALIZE I MEAN LITERALLY HOW YOU VISUALIZE THEM AS A VISUAL PROBLEM OR A VISUAL GOAL HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER OR NOT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THOSE GOALS AND WHETHER NOT THEY WILL LEAD TO STILL GREATER GOALS THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE TO DAY'S EPISODE IS AN ESPESSIALLY IMPORTANT ONE I BELIEVE BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO LEARN ABOUT QUALITY PUREREVIEWED SCIENCE FROM THE EXPERT IN THIS FIELD OF GOAL SETTING MOTIVATION AND PURSUIT AND YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO LEARN AN IMMENSE NUMBER OF PRACTICAL TOOLS THAT YOU CAN APPLY TOWARD YOUR EDUCATIONAL GOALS YOUR CAREER GOALS RELATIONSHIP GOALS GOALS OF ANY SORT BY THE END OF TO DAY'S EPISODE YOU WILL BE BETTER EQUIPPED TO SET AND ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS DOCTORABALCHEDIS ALSO SHARES WITH US HER OWN EXPERIENCES OF HOW TO SET VISUALIZES AND ACHIEVE GOALS AND SHE DOES THAT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF HAROL AS APPARENT AS SOMEBODY NAVIGATING RELATIONSHIPS OF VARIOUS KINDS AND A DEMANDING CAREER SO AGAIN I THINK THAT YOU'LL FIND THE INFORMATION TO DAY TO BE BOTH EXTREMELY ACADEMICALLY GROUNDED IN TERMS OF RESEARCH EXTREMELY PRACTICAL AND REALISTIC IN TERMS OF HOW YOU MIGHT APPLY IT IN YOUR OWN LIFE BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTOROLIKE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR NOWSALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLITES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLIKE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHOSITS AND COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACK TO ELECTOR LIKE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THATS ONE GRAHM OF SODIUM TWO UNDER MILEGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KOND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'VE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT  DOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT EL EMENTE DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND NOW FOR M DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR EMILY BELCHETTUS E THANKS ORE BEING HERE HIT'S MY PLEASURE I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWAR TO THE FOR A LONG TINE BECAUSE THRE'S A VISION SCIENTIST IS ALSO VERY INTERESTED IN REALIZE TOOLS AND GOAL SETTING AND MOTIVATION YOUR WORK LAND SQUARELY IN THE MIDDLE OF THOSE INTERESTS SO JUST TO KICK THINGS OFF CAN TELL US JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERCEPTION AND IN PERCULAR HOW WE SEE THE WORLD AND GOAL SETTING AND GOAL RETRIEVAL IT'S A VAST LANDSCAPE BUT YOU'RE THE EXPERT SOI TURN THAT OVER TO YOU AND THEN AS TIME GOES ON I MAY HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AS IT RELATES TO DIFERENT KINDS OF VISION BUT WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH VISION AND MOTIVATION HOW DO THOSE TWO THINGS LINCON TOTALLY I MEU NOT ILIVER ME WHEN PTHY CHOLEGIST ASK EPI HOW ARE YOU WHAT R YOU DOING TO HELP MA PROGRESS ON YOUR GOALS IS THAY ALL KINDS OF THINGS COUPLE OF TINGS ALWAYS TOP TO THE TOP IT IS I SHOK MYSELF IN ENCOURAGING WAYS HIMSELF SELF PEPTOK SOR I REMAND MYSELF OF HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO TO DO THIS JOB OR NOW I'LL PUT UP POSTED NOTES OV OW AND I TO A CONSTANTLY BENAGGING ME ABOUT WHAT I NEED TO DO SO THESES ARE COMMON TACTICS THAT PEOPLE USE WHAT WILL NOTICE IS THAT IS A REALLY EFFORTFUL HAVING AT CONSTANTLY REMIND YOURSELF HAVING A CONSTANTLY TALKD YOURSELF HAVING A CREATE THOSE POSTTED NOTES REMEMBER TO LOOK AT THEM ALL OF THAT TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT AND COMMITTMENT AND SO WHAT IS SURPRISE THAT PEOPLE BURN OUT IT'S EXCITING TO WORK ON A GOAL WHEN YOUE WHEN YOU FIRST SAT IT YOU MIGHT MAKE SOME INITIAL PROGRESS BUT AN EVENTUALLY WE GET YOU KNOW NOT EVEN TO THE HALF WAY POINT BUT BEFORE THINGS GET REAL THINGS ARE OUR CHALLENGING AND WE FALL BY THE WAYSIDE AND THAT'S I THINK BECAUSE OS TACTICS THAT ARE ARE GO TO STRATEGIES ARE THEMSELVES A GOAL TO MAINTAIN SO IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW DOUBLE SITED WERE PUTTING SO MUCH ON OURSELVES TO TRY TO ADVANCE THE THING THAT WE ORIGINALLY SET OUT TO ACCOMPLISH SO THET I YOU KNOW WITH MY TEAM AS TRY TO THING OF LOK WHAT ARE STRATEGIES THIT DON'T REQUIRE AS MUCH EFFORT THAT WE CAN AUTOMATE THAT WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING WITHIN OURSELVES WITHIN OUR BODY WITHIN OUR MIND THAT MIGHT OVERCOME ONE OF THOSE CHALLENGEIS THAT'LL BE EASIER MORE AUTOMATED AND THAT'S WHAT WE STARTED TO LAND ON THE IDEA OF VISION WE LOOK AT THE WORLD WITHOUT EVEN THINKING OF IT FOR THOSE OF US THAT ARE INSITED AND AND WE THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT THE ARTH THERE ARE STRATEGIES THAT WE CAN USE TO LOOK AT THE WORLD IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND THAT WE CAN AUTOMATE THAT MIGHT HELP US TO OVERCOME SOME OBSTACLES TO MAKE PROGRESS ON OUR GOALS TO MAY BE LITERALLY SEE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE BEFORE SO WE STARTED PLAYING AROUND WITH THE IDEA OF VISUAL ILLUSIONS TO SEE DO BE BELIEVEN KNOW THAT THERE'S OTHER WAYS OF SEEING THINGS AROUND THEM CAN WE TWEAK THAT ARES TE ROOM FOR INTERVENTION CAN WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE OR IM TO TAKE A NEW WAY OF LOOKING TUST TO SEE THINGS THAT THEY HAVN'T SEEN BEFORE AND THAT'S WHAT REALLY OPENE US UP TO TRYING TO LOOK AT THAT INTERSECTION BETWEEN VISION SCIENCE AND MOTIVATION SCIENCE SCRAT AND A I WE SAY IN HERE I'M STRONGLY BY USED AS A VISION SCIENTISTS THT YOUR VISION IS THE DOMINANT SENSE BY WHICH WE NAVIGATE THE WORLD IN SURVIVE I LOVE THIS IDEA OF REREAL WORLD REAL TIME ACCESS DIVISION AND I'M CERTAINLY FAMILIAR WITH HOW GUAL SETTINGERS OR POSTED AND YOU KNOW IN MAGNETS ON REFRIGRATORS CAN HAVE AN IMMEDIAT IN FACT WIT AN OVERTIME AN THEY BECOME SO PART OF THE VISUAL LANDSCAPE THAT YOU OVERLOOK THEM AN WE KNOW AS VISION SCIENTIST IF SOMETHING IS STABLY IN THE ENVIRONMENT EVENTUALLY YOUR BLIND TO IT SO THAT MAKES GOOD SENSE SO YOU'VE PUBLISH A NUMBER OF STUDIES IN THIS AREA BUT A MAYBE COULD HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE MORE AWHAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER N IMPORTANT FINDINGS IN THE AREA OF HOW PEOPLE CAN A JUST THEIR VISION IN ORDER TO MEET GOALS MORE QUICKLY AND MORE EFFICIENTLY AN PERHAPS ALSO HOW WE COM WE ALL ARRIVE AT GOALS WITH DIFFERENT VISUAL PERCEPTIONS AND THAT IN SOME WAY MAY DIVIDE US INTO HIGHLY MOTIVATED AND LESS MODIVATED PEOPLE INOTHER WORDS A WHAT'S THE LINK BETWEEN VISION AND MOIVATION AND HOW CAN WE LEVERAGE THAT IN ORDER TO BETTER RETARCLES TOTALLY SO IU KNOW WE STARTED THINKING ABOUT WHAT ARE THE GALES TAT AUR MOST IMPORTANT A PEOPLE THAT THEY STRUGGLE WITH THE MOST SO WE ASKED HUNDREDS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHAT THEIR NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS ARE WE LOOK TO ALL THE OTHER POLS THAT THAT DO THE SAME KIND OF WORK AND REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU LOOK OR WHO YOU ASK FOR WHEN YOU ASK I PEOPLE'S NUMBER ONE GOAL IS SOMETHING RELATED TO THEIR HEALTH RIGHT SOD TO LOSE WAIGT TO EXERCISE MORE TO TO GET OUT GET MORE STEPS FOR MENTAL WELL BEING PHYSICAL WELL BEING AND AND THAT'S LIKE THE NUMBER ONE GOAL EVERY JANUARY FIRST SO IF IF WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL YOU THINK IT WOULD DROP A LITTLE BIT IN THE RANKINGS BUT IT DOESNAT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY HARD SO WE THOUGHT I WONDER IF THERE'S A WAY FOR US TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS ON THAT ON HELPING PEOPLE TO EXERCISE BETTER MORE OFTEN STICK TO IT LONGER AND AND MAKE SOME PROGRESS THERE WE KNOW DIETS DON'T WORK AND WHY IT WHY DON'T DIET'S WRKT FOR THE SAME REASON THAT THAT SELF TALK DOESN'T WORK IS THAT YOU KOW WE GO IN IT FUL BORE HARD CORE AND IT REQUIRES A MAJOR COMMITMENT AN EFFORT TO A LIFE STILE CHANGE SO AGAIN WE WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE EASIER THAN THAT THAT COULD PRODUCE BIG BIG PAY OFF RIGHT THAT'S THAT'S THE GOLDEN TICKET IS SOMETHING THAT REQUIRES LAST EFFORT FOR A BIGGER PAY OFF SO WHNE ARE THE FIRST THINGS THAT I DID WAS A GO OVER TO BROOKLYN TO THIS OLD ARMORY BUILDING YOU KNOW YOU SOOD THEUSE TO BE A MILITARY ARMORY SPAY SAND AND O THER BI YES A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING OUT THE HOUSES A LOT OF BUSINESSNESS RORD WIPLANTS ON THE WALLS THEETHER  BUSINESS IS THERE'S A COUPLE ARMORIES ALL AROUND ON THE THE THE BORROUGS HERE AROUND NEW YORK CITY AND ANT IN ONE IN BROOKLIN IN PATICULAR IS NOW WYM S A RIGHT SO IT'S A FAMILY WHY M S A THAT'S WITHIN AS BEAUTIFUL OLD RED BRICK BUILDING THAT YOUSE TO BE A MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT LONG LONG AGO AND WHATS REALLY COOL IS THAT YOU KNOW ONE WINTER AFTER AFTERNOON A YEU SOMEBODY HAD INVITED ME A PHYSICAL THARAPISTS SAID YOU SHOULD COME OUT ON AND CHECK OUT WHATS HAPPENING HERE WITH YOUR INTERESTS IN EXERCISE AND TRYING TO FIND NEW WAYS OF HELPING PEOPLE AN YOU TACTICS THAT THEY CAN ADD TO THEIR TOOL BELT I THIN YOU CAON FIND SOME INTERESTING PEOPLE TAT ARE WORKING OUT THERE THEY WAS SHOWED UP I LOOK AROUND YOU KNOW THERE'S FAMILIES THERE'S NEW MOMS THERE'S KIDS THAT AR IN A MOMS TRYING TO GET KIDS TO BURN OFF SOME WINTER YOU KNOW ENERGY THAT THEY HAVE THERE'S PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE THEIR JUST THERE FOR THERE YOU KNOW EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS GOINE OUT FOR A RUN THERE SOME PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE THEIR TRAINING WITH HA TEAM AND THAT'S WHO THIS PHYSICAL THARAPIST INTRODUCED INTRODUCED ME TO IS THET WAS THE COACH OF THIS TEAM HERE'S A MUTCH PEOLE EVWER SITTING DOWN ON THE GROUND AND I WOULD BE HARD PRESSE TO KNOW WHO'SE THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT THAT'S IN THIS GROUP AND THEN WHO AS IT TURNS OUT ARE SOME OF THE FASTEST RUNNERS IN THE WORLD LIKE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE PEOPLETHAT WAS IN THE THE LAST OLYMPICS BEFORE I SHOWED UP WHEN THE GOLD METAL FOR THE FOR HUNDRED METER AND AND FROM THE LOOKS OF THEM I'M MEA COURSE THE'RE BODIES ARE IN BETTER SHAPE THAN MINE BUT THERE'S NOTHING SO PRETENSITHE COURSE ARE NOT WEARING THEIR MEALS ORS NOTHING PRETENSIOUS ABOUT HOW THERE WALKING AROUND OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT WOULD LED ME TO NOTHER HI'S PERSON'S AMAZING AND THEY PROBABLY HAVE SOME INSIDE THAT I DON'T HAVE SO ONCE I GOT INTRODUCED TO THEM IN NEW WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE THAT WERE PAR OF THIS A PRETTY A LEAT A TRAINING TEAM THAT HAPPEN TO WORK OUT AT THIS FAMILY JIM AH I THE CHANCE TO TALK WITH THEM ABOUT WHAT STRATEGIES DO YOU USE NOW I AM NOT AN A WEAT RUNNER AND A HAVING RECENTLY HAD A BABY I'M NOT REALLY A RUNNER RIGHT NOW AT ALL BUT I THOUGHT WHEN THESE PEOPLE ARE RUNNING I BUT THEY ARE LIKE HIPER AWARE OF EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON IN THEYR SURROUNDINGS WHERE ARE THEY RELATIVE TO THE COMPETITION WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THEIR PRIFERAL VISION WATS GOING ON ON THE SIDE WHOSE BEHIND THEM WHO'S IN FRONT OF THEM THEY PROBABLY HAVE THE SLIKE MASTER SENSE THIS MASTER VISUAL PLAN AT ANY POINT IN TIME AND THAT'S WHAT PROBLY MAKES THEM A LEAD SO IN A CERTAIN ASKING THEM IS THAT THE CASE TOU DO YOU REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT'S IN YOUR SURROUNDINGS WHAT'S BEHIND YOU WHATS ON THE SIDE THEY SAID KNOW LIKEALL OF THEM SAID NO AND SOMETIMES WHEN I DO DO THAT IT'S A MISTAKE IT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME SO THAT WAS SURPRISING TOTALLY WIN AGAINST MY INTUITION ABOUT WHAT THEY DO THAT LIKELY CONTRIBUTES TO THEIR SUCCESS WHAT THEY SAID AN STUD WAS THAT THEY ARE HYPER FOCUST THEY ASSUME THIS NARROWED FOCUS OF ATTENTION ALMOST LIKE A SPOT LIGHT IS IS SHINING ON A TARGET  NOW WHENTHEY'R RUNNING A SHORT DISTANCE THAT TARGET MIGHT LITERALLY BE THE FINISH LINE THE LINE THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO CROSS BUT'S A LONGER DISTANCE THEY SET SUB GOALS LIKE YOU KNW THE PERSON THE SHORTS ON THE PERSON UP AHEAD THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO BEAT OR THEY CHOOSE SOME SORT OF STABLE LAND MARKD LIKE A SIGN THAT THAT THEY WOULD PASS BY AND LIKE A SPOT LIGHT ES SHINING JUST ON THAT OR LIKE THEY HAVE BLINDERS ON THE SIDES OF THEIR FACE THAT'S ALL THEY'RE PAYING ATTENTION TO REALLY NARROWED SCOPE OF ATTENTION AND THAT WAS A STRATEGY THAT THEY THAT ALL O TESE ALEAT ATHLETES SAID THAT THEY USED IN THOSE THAT WERE BETTER RATHER THAN IM YOU KNOW THAT THEN SLOWER WERE ONCE THAT USED IT MORE AND I THOUGHT  LET'S SOMETHING THE CAN PLAY WITH ILIKETHEY ARE A LEAT AND THEY ARE ACCOMPLISHED BUT THAT VISUAL STRATEGY ISN'T IT NECESSARILY SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE PERFECT PHYSICAL CONDITION TO BE ABLE TO ADOPT AND SO I WONDER CANNOT HELP THE REST OF US WHO AREN'T COMPETING FOR AN OLYMPIC GOLD AND WHO HAVE NO CHANCE OF EVER GETTING ON BUT WHO WANT TO EXERCISE BETTER HAVE A BETTER HAVE A BETTER TIME DOING IT AND  MAINTAIN A COMMITMENT TO THAT EXERCISE GOAL T THEY MIGHT HAVE THAT THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE YOU KOW'T BY FEBRUARY ARE MARCH BE GIVING UP ON IF THEY HAD SAID AT AT THE BEGINNING OF OF JANUARY SO THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE WORK STARTED WAS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL IK FOCUST GROUPS ARE CASE STUDIES OF THESE INCREDIBLE ATHLETES AND A AND THOUGH WE DIDS OTHER STUDIES LOOKING AT YOU KNOW YOU ON'T PEOPLE WHO AREN'TOLYMPIC ATHLETES BUT WHO ARE COMPETITIVE AND NEW YORK ROAD RUNNERS RUNNERS AND HOW ARE THEY RUNNING IN RACES AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THOSE PEOPLE HAVE BETTER PACE FASTER PACE BETTER TIME A THEY USE THAT NARROWED STRATEGY MORE OFTEN THEN THIS MORE EXPANCEEVE OR YOU KNOW OPEN SCOPE OF ATTENTION ND TERE SEEM TO BE A CORRELATION BETWEEN THAT BETTER PERFORMANCE AMONG A WIDER SWATH OF HUNDREDS OF OF RUNNERS E'RE DOING IT COMPETITIVELY BUT STILL YOU NOW COULD BE LIKE THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE SITTING NEXT TO IN THE OFFICE OR YOURSELF I AND THE MORE OFTEN THAT THEY DID IT THE AND THE MORE AM CONSISTENTLY THEY HAD ADOPT DID THAT THAT TECHNIQUE OF THE NARROWED FOCUSS OF ATTENTION THAT SEUMS THAT THEY WERE DOING BETTER IN THEIR RUNS SO THEN WE STARTED THINKING MY COQE WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WHO AREN'T COMPETED RUNNERS WHAT ABOUT  MY MOM WE CAN CAN CAN SHE DO THAT OR ME WHEN I'M TRYING TO GET BACK ON THE BAND WAGON AN EXERCISE MORE IS THIS TA TACTIC WE CAN TEACH PEOPLE THE ANSWER IS YES WE CAN TELL PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT THESE OLYMPIC ATHLETES ARE DOING YOU CAN TELL THEM ABOUT WHAT THE NEW YORK ROAD RUNNERS RUNNERS ARE DOING AND JUST USING THE SAME LANGUAGE THAT I DIST USE WITH YOU RIGHT AGIN THAT THERE'S A SPOTLIGKT SHINING JUST ON A TARGET CHOOSE CHOOSE SOMETHING UP AHEAD THE STOP SINE TWO BLOCKS UP THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN JUST SEE AND YOU N IMAGINE THAT YOU YOU HAVE BLINDERS ON SO THT YOU'RE NOT REALLY PAYING ATTENTION OFT PEOPLE THAT ARE PASSING BY OR THE BUILDINGS OF THE GARBAGE CANS OR THE OR THE TRUCK SETTER ON THE ROAD YOU KNOW TONE THOSE OUT AND FOLKUS IN ON THAT TARGET TILL YOU HIT IT AND THEN CHOOSE ANOTHER ONE RIGHT SO RECALEBRATE CHOOSE THE NEXT GOAL AN SO WE WOULD TEST LIKE CAN'T PEOPLE DO THAT IFYOU'RE LISTENING RIGT NOW WE HOW WEOURE IMAGINING THAT EXPERIENCE TOO IN THE ANSWERS YES LIKE I CAN IMAGINE THAT I KNOW WHAT THOSE WORDS MEAN AND I CAN DO THAT AND OUR WORK FOUND THAT TOO IF PEOPLE CAN DO THAT WE HAVE THEM SAY OUT LOUD WHAT IS IT THAT'S CAPTURED YOUR ATTENTION AND OF COURSE SOME TIMES SOMETHING IN THE PIFERY LIKE MOVEMENT CAPTUERES OUR GAZE AN AND WER OUR PULLED THERE FOR FOR AN INSTAND BUT THAN WE CAN REFOCUSS UP AGAIN AND ADOPT THAT NARROWED ATTENTION NOW ONE ARE THE FIRST STUDIES THAT WE DID WAS WAS TEACH THAT STRATEGY AND JUCK SUPPOSE ARE COMPARE IT AGAINST A GROUP THAT WE SAID JUST LOOK AROUND NATURALLY OU KNOW YOU MIGHT SEE THAT FINISHD LINE UP AHEAD AND THER'S THINGS ON THE PERIFERY WHATEVER YOUR EYES WANT TO DO WHATEVER YOU THINK IT'S GON A WORK BEST FEEL FREE TO DO THAT UNTILS WHAT OU'RE LOOKING AT THEN WE GAVE THEM A FINISH LINE WE CREATED SORT OF YOU KNOW AN EXERCISE THAT'S MODERATELY CHALLENGING A BUT POSSIBLE WE PUT ANKLE WEIGHTS ON THAT THAT ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THEIR BODY WEIGHT TOLD THEM TO LIFT THEIR KNEES UP SORT OF HIGH STEPPING TO A FINISH LINE SOTHIS WOUD BE CHALLENGING A FOR THEM TO DO A BUT WE SAID YOU KNOWSN'T INDICATOR OF OVER ALL HEALTH AND FITNESS SOME OF THESE PEOPLE HAD NARROWED HEIR FOCUS OF ATTENTION AND SOME WERE JUST LOOKING MORE EXPANSIVELY OR NATURALLY AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THOSE PEOPLE THAT WE TRAIN JUST EVERYDAY NORMAL PEOPLE DOING THIS THIS MODERATELY CHALLENGING EXERCISE THEY WERE ABLE TO MOVE TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT FASTER THEY COAN DO THE EXERCISE MORE QUICKLY AND THE SET IT HURT SEVENTEEN PER CENT LESS THE EXERCISE WAS EXACTLY THE SAME FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WE SET WE SET THE WEIGHT AND WE SET THE DISTANCE IT WAS IN YOU KOW OUR LABSBAY SO IT WAS A CON CONSTRAINED ANVIRONMENT EVERYBODY WAS IN THE SAME SORT OF CIRCUMSTANCE BUT YET THEIR EXPERIENCE WAS REALLY DIFFERENT WE HELPED THEM TO MOVE FASTER BURN CALERYES AT A HIGHER RATE RIGHT EXERCISE MORE EFFICIENTLY THE AMOUNT OF TIME THEY PUT IN AS GEN TO PRODUCE A BETTER A PHYSICAL OUT COME AND IT ALSO I DIDN'T HURT THEM RIGHT THEI'RE SAYING IT DOESN'T HURT AS MUCH SO WE WERE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT RIGHT BECAUSE IT MEANT THAT THIS STRATEGY WE COULD USE ON ON PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT AT LE ATHLEDES IT COUN BE EASILY ADOPTED A QUICK TRAINING SESSION T CAN TEACH PEOPLE TO LOOK AT THE WORLD IN A DIFFERENT WAY AGAIN THIS NARROWED A TENTION WAS DIFFERENT TAND WHATEVER THEY DO NATURALLY THE COMPARISON GROUP A BUT IT HAD A BIG OUTCOME IT HAD A BIG DIFFERENCE ON THE WAY THAT THEY WERE ENGAGED IN THE EXERCISE THOSE LIKE SOME OF THE FIRST WORK THAT WE DID AND THEN SINCE AN WE'VE DONE YOU KNOW THATDOZENS MORE STUDIES TIL LOK AN  WHAT HAPPENS A THAT AND AN WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO WITH PLAYIN AROUND WITH THIS O THOSE ARE IMPRESSIVE DIFFERENCES AT'S A CONSEQUENCE OF NARROWING VISUAL ATTENTION COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ACTUAL PRACTICE OF NARROWING ATTENTION IS THERE ANY INDICATION OF WHETHER OR NOT SUBJECTS A ARE CONSTANTLY UPDATING THEIRE VISUAL TENTION SO FOR INSTANCE IF ATETS SAY THE GOAL LINE IS IN VIEW LITERALLY FROM THE BEGINNING I CAN IMAGINE JUST HOLDING VISUAL ATTENTION ON ON THE GOA LINE BUT AM IF IT'S A OVAL TRACT OR IT'S A TRAJECTORY OUT LONG A TRAIL OR THROUGH A CITY HOW OFTEN DO YOU THINK THEY ARE UPDATING THEIR AM THEIR VISUAL APERTURE IND SETTING A VISUAL GOAL AND I COULD IMAGINE THAT THERE'S SOME ENERGETIC EXPENSE TO THAT SO THAT A MEANING HOW YOU KNOW YOU WOULN'T WANT TO DO EVERY CRACK ON THE SIDEWALK UNLESS THOSE CRACKS ON THE SIDEWALK WERREY FAR APART RBECAUSE I THINK IT SOME POINT THAT ITSELF WOULD BE EXHAUSTED AM SO IS THEIR AN OPTIMAL STRATEGY OR A SEMI OPTIMAL STRATEGY YES SO YOU KNOW THOSE OLYMPIC ATHLETES THAT WE THAT WE STARTED BY INTERVIEWING THEY TENDED TO BE SPRINTERS THEY WERE MOR OFTEN SPRINTER SHORT DISTANCE PRINTERS SO WHEN THEY SAID LIKE YES I NARROW IN MORE THAN I ASSUME AN EXPANSIVE FOCUS THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING THAT FAR RIGHT THEY HAVE TO DO IT AS FAST AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING NOT FAR AND SO WE SERT AT ASKING THAT QUESTION TOO ABOUT LIKE WOULDN'T THAT BE TIRING AND THE ANSWER IS YES SO WHEN WE START TO LOOK THA WLE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T SPRNTERS WHO ARE ACCOMPLISHED BUT WHO ARE MORE LONG DISTANCE RUNNERS THAT'S WHAT WE FIND THAT THEY DO IS THAT THEY AN OU KNOW THEY'RE USING THAT NARROWED ATTENTION STRATEGY STRATIGICALLY AND IT INCREASES IN USE THEY USE IT MOR OFTEN AS THE RACE PROGRESSIES AND THEY REALLY START TO DO THI IN A MAJOR SWITCH AN A ABOUT THE HALF WAY POINT OF SAY LIKE A TEN KILOMETER RUNS SO PEOPLE WHO ARE SEASONED RUNNERS THEY REALLY START MAKING A SWITCH WITH WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH AM AND NOT'S WERE THEY MORE OFTEN MORE FREQUENTLY AND ARE MORE INTENTIONALLY ADOPTING A NARROWED FOCUS OF ATTENTION WHEN THEY'RE IN THE LAST COUPLE MILES OF A RUN WHEN MAYBE THER RESOURCES ARE STUDING AGET MORE THIN MAY BE THEIR MOTIVATION STARTING TO FAD TAT TIPPING POINT IN THE MIDDLE IS WITH ANY KIND OF GOAL WHERE PEOPLE STRUGGLE MOST AAND NOTS WHEN THEY ARE LIKE DOUBLING DOWN ON A STRATEGY THAT THEY KNOW TO BE EFFECTIVE SO YOU KNON AT FIRST LONGER DISTANCE RUNNERS ARE ARE NOT USING THAT NARROWED STRATEGY THERE AS THEY'RE LOOKING MORE EXPANSIVELY AN BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT FIRST OF ALL DISTRACTION IS A THING IF USEFUL NOT NECESSARILY THAT THEY'RE DISTRACTING THEMSELVES BE CAUSE PEOPLE ARE STILL TRYING TO HOLD PEACE AND JOSTLE AMONG PROABLY AND MORE CONCENTRATED GROUP OF RUNNERS AN BUT IT IS A STRATEGY THAT THEY USE AND THEN SORT OF WEN OFF OF N AS THE B ASE GOES THROUGH AND AT'S PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING FOR THAT LAST PUSH RIGHT THE LAST PUSH TO GET OVER THE FINISHED LINE WHEN L YOU MIGHT BE LITERALLY NECK AND NECK WITH SOMEBODY THAT YOU'R YOU'RE TRYING TO TO JUST BE OUT OR WHEN YOU'RE MOST TIRED BUT YOU KNOW LIKE THA LST PUSH YEU DON'T WANT A YOU DON'T WANT TO DROP OFF AM YOU YNOWING YOU WEN A WHEN YOU WANT TO PUSH THROUGH HARD THROUGH THAT FINISH LINE NOUT WHEM PEOPLE ARE USING IT AT ITS PEAP LEVEL OF INTENSITY I SE YE I TO ME THIS  MAKES TOTAL SENSE WHY IT WOULD WORK A WITHOUT GOING DOWN THE THE RABBIT WHOLE OF VISUAL NUR SCIENCE UF ON THE COR ANOTHER TIME WHEN WE DO THESE VERGENTS IG MOVEMENTS WHEN WE BRING OUR AS TO AVISUAL TARGET IT'S CLEAR THAT SOME OF THE BRAINS SEMD CIRCUITORY FOR ALERTNESS GETS A ENGAGED ATO A GREATER DEGREE THE OTHER THING IS HAT WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE FOCUS ON AN OBJECT THAT YET THE OBJECTS OF THE EYE CHANGE AND NARROW THE VISUAL FEEL SO THAT BRINGS ABOUT THIS IS A VERY DETAIL QUESTION BAT 'M SURE THE AUDIENCEIS IS WONDERING IF LETS AY UNFOCUSED ON A GOAL LINE OR OR A  INTERMEDIATE GOAL ORE THE FOCUS GON A SPECIFIC QAINTORS IT CAN OF THE ENTIRE HORIZON OF THAT GOAL BECAUSE THE FINISH LINE IS INDEED A LINE AM SO IN OF COURSE IS IS IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHAT SOME ONE IS ACTUALLY DOING IN THEIR MINDS EY BUT HOW DO PEOPLE REPORT THIS DO THEY SEE IT LITERALLY IS A SPOT LIKE AND IF SO HOW BROAD IS THAT SPOT YES SO YOU KNOW IT IS THA THA THE LENGT OF OF THEIR APERTURE RATHER THAN THE MAY BE THE DIAMETER WIT THE FER SPER SIZE OF IT AM YOU KOW IN OUR INTERVIEWS WITH PEOPLE ARE OUR SIR FOCUS GROUP STUDIES AM IT SEEMS LIKE ITS MORE LIKE A A CIRCULAR POINT AND NOTS IN FACT WHAT WE'RE TEACHING PEOPLE WHAT WE'RE TRAINING THEM TO DO SO RATHER THAN GOING BROADLY LOOKING ACROSS A LINE FROM LEFT TO WRIHT WE ARE ENCOURAGING THEM TO THEY IMAGINE A CIRCLE OF LIGHT THATS SHINING ON SOME TARGET NOW CROSS O FINISH LINE IS A LINE BUT IF THEY'R STAYING IN THEIR LANE THE'RE ON A TRACK RIGHT YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THERE IS THAT THERE IS A CIRCLE SHINING JUST ON WHERE AND THEIR LANE IL CROSS THAT FINISHD LINE OR IF ITS A STOPSINE YOU COAND IMAGINE A CIRCLE OF LIGHT ILLUMINATING THAT SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TEACHING PEOPLE TO USE IN THAT WHAT SEEMS TO BE EFFECTIVE TO MAINTAIN THAT FOCUS RATHER THANS ARE BEING PULLED TO ENGAGE WITH PERFERAL VISION ANDTHER'RE SOME AMAZING PEOPLE I'M SOME RUNNERS IN HISTORY LIKE JON BEEN WA SAMUEL SAND SHES ONE OF THE FIRST A FEMALE MARATHON COMPETITORIS WHO AS WANT AS ONE MULTIPLE MARITHONS SHE'S CANADY ANYTHING SHE'S ON FILFHRY TO CORRECT ME LI TEN MARATHONS AND IN HER LIFE AAND SHE TALKS ABOUT SORT OF NOT ASSUMING THIS TE THIS WIDE BUT BUT NARROW WHAT WIDE BUT NOTS DEEP OR TALL A ATTENTIONAL FOCUS SHE TALKS ABOUT LIKE FINDING THE SHORT SOM SOMEBODY AHEAD OF ME AND FOCUSING ON ON THOSE SHORTS UNTIL SHE PASSES THEM AND THEN RESETTING THAT GAL SO IN YOU KNOW HER INTERVIEWS THAT SHE'S DONE WITH RUNNERS MAGAZINES SHE TALKS ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF THIS THE CIRCLE OF ATTENTION I THINK I'VE EXPERIENCE TO SOLOBIT AM BECAUSE WE'RE BUSIY NEW YORK NOW TO DO THIS INTERVIEW AND A RUNNERS HERE SEEM MORE COMPETITIVE THE RECREATIONAL RUNNERS YOURE SEE MORE COMPETEVE WALK PEOPLE WALKING IN THE STREET SEEM COMPEIO YOURE WALKING AT NEAR PACE TO SOMEBODY THEY'L QUICKLY SPEED UP FOU SPEED OUP THEY'LL SPEED UP I THNK HERE BEEN SOME STUDIES ABOUT WALKING SPEED INDIFFERENT CITIES AN NEW YORK RANKS AMONG THE FASTEST WALKERS ROUND I WON'T MENTION THE SLOWEST WALKING CITIES CAS WE DON'T WANT A CAST ANY JUDGMENTS BUT A FASCINATING A AND AGAIN MAKES TOTAL SENSE SPACE ON THE WAY THE THE VICIAL SYSTEM MEASURES BOTH SPACE AND TIME SO AND WAY LL GETTING TO  LIBIT LATER BUT A'M CURIOUS WHETHER NOT THIS THE WHOLE THING WORKS IN REVERSE AS WELL MEANING AT DO PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY MOTIVE TO EXERCISE DO THEY THINK THIS WAY NATURALLY A PEOPLE WHO ARE RAVERSE TO EXERCISE OR WHO FIND IT HARD TO GET MOTIVATED TO EXERCISE DO THEY VIEW THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY LITERALLY I HAVE SO MUCH THAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS IM SO IF YOU'LL HUMOR ME IL GIVE YOU A COUPLE DIFFERENT A STORIES ABOUT NOW WE CAN ANSWER THAT DO YOU DN'T OVE TO DO A DEEP DIVE IN O VISION SCIENCE WHICH OF COURSE YOU ARE CAPABLE OF DOING A BUT BUT WHAT I CAN SHARE WITH YOU IS SUM LIKE ANIMAL STUDIES WHERE THIS WORK AN A FIRST STARTED THIS IS IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES NINETEEN FIFTIES RAT LABS MICE LABS AND THEY WERE LOOKING OU KNOT THOSE WERE THE FIRST MODELS OF OF A OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR THAT PEOPLE WERE WERE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND MOTIVATION MOTIVATION SCIENCE WITHIN SO THEY WOULD OU KNOW DEPRIVE THESE POOR RATS AND MICE OF FOOD OR WATER SO THAT THEY WERE MOTIVATED TO TO GET IT THEY ARE HUNGRY AND THEY WERE THIRSTY AND THEY HAD PRACTICE RUNNING A MAZE WO THEY KNEW WHERE THEY COULD FIND THAT FOOD OR WATER WHATEVER THAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR AND WHAT THESE RESARCHERS WER STUDYING WAS THE PEACE OF OF MOVEMENT THROUGH THE MAZE SO AS THES AS THE RATS WERE LIKE GOING THROUGH THE MAZE THEYTHEY FOUND THAT EVEN THOUGH THESE RATS WERE HUNGRY AND THEIR HAVING TO EXPEND LIMITED COLLORIC I AM ENERGY TO MAKE IT TO THE FINISH LING THEY ASHALLY RAN FASTER THE CLOSER THEY GOT TO THAT FINISHD LINE SO ONCE THAT FINISH LING BECAME NEARER TO THEM THEY ACTUALLY NO USE THEIR RESOURCES PROBABLY IN A SUBOPTUMALY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CROSSD THE FINISH LINING GOT THEIR REWARD SO IT WAS LIKE SOME OF THE FIRST EARLY WORK THAT THAT WAS SHOWING THAT YOU KNOW PROXIMITY TO A GOAL INCREASE AS THE INVESTMENT IN IN RESOURCES OF PEOPLE THAT ANIMALS IEWS TO MEET THAT GOAL EVEN WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TO SPARE AND WITH THE MICE THE SAME KIND OF THING YOU KNOW THEY WERE THE ACTUALLY HAD THE LITTLE HARNESSES ON THEM THEYARE LOOKING AT HOW HARD DO THE MICE POAL A TO TRY TO MAKE IT TO THE FOOD OR THE WATER THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO GET AND SAME DEAL THE CLOSER THEY GOT TO TO GETTING THEIR REWARD THE HARDER THEY WERE PULLING EVEN THOUGHTHEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT THAT MUCH ENERGY TO SPARE AND THEY HAD ALREADY USE SUM UP GETTING TO THAT FINISH LINE SO THAT WAS THAT WAS THAT EARLY ANIMAL RESEARCH FROM THE NINETEEN FORTIESE NINETEEN FIFTIES THAN SPURRED A WHOLE WAVE OF OF WORK IN HUMANS TO HUMANS DO THE SAME THING AND EVEN WHEN THEY'RE TIRED BUT THEY CAN THEY CAN SEE OR THEY CAN FEEL THAT THEIR GOAL IS CLOSE DO THEY DOUBLE DOWN AND WORK EVEN HARDER TO CROSS THAT FINISH LINE YEITHER LIKE A LITERAL FINISH LINE OF FOR TUNKING ABOUT EXERCISE OR METAPHORICAL FINISH LINE OF WORD TALKING ABOUT ANY OTHER KEN OF GOAL THAT PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE AND THE ANSWER IS YES THEY CALLED THAT THE GOAL RADIENT HYPOTHESIS TE CLOSER YOU GET TO THE GOAL GENERALLY THE HARDER PEOPLE AND ANIMALS WORK TO TO FINISH THAT GOAL THAT'S WHAT LED US THEN TO THINK OKA YOU KNOW THOSE RATS THOSE MICE THOSE PEOPLE ARE SEEING A FINISH LINE MAY AND IT'S WHEN THERE MAY BE SEEING THAT FINISH LINE SEEING THAT REWARD SEEING ME GOALD OR HOPING TO ACCOMPLISH THAT IS WHAT'S LEADING THEM TO YOU NO TRY HARDER TO INVEST MORE SO THAT THEY CAN FINISH IT OFF WHAT IF WE INDUCE THAT ALLUSION OF PROXIMITY WHAT IF WE CAN INDUCE A VISUAL ILLUSION A VISUAL EXPERIENCE AM THAT APPROXIMATES WHAT THE REAL RATS IN MICE WERE EXWERE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCING AS THEY GOT CLOSER SO THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING VISUALLY WHEN WE CREATE THAT NARROWED FOCUS OF ATTENTION WHEN WE TELL PEOPLE IMAGINE THERE'S A SPOT LIGHT ON THE SHORTS OF THE PERSON UP AHEAD OR THE STOP SINE THAT YOUR SEEING IT INDUCES AN ILLUSION OF PROXIMITY THAT THEN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TRYING HARDER WALKING FASTER FEELING THAT IT DEFIE THEIR EXPECTATIONS AND THA IT WASN'T AS THAT AS THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SO WE DO THINGS LIKE MEASURE LIKE MEASURE THEIR VISUAL EXPERIENCE HOW FAR AWAY IS THAT FINISH LINE COURSE WE CAN ASK THEM TO REPORT IN FEET HOW MAMY FEET IS IT BUT THAT'S CHALLENGING RIGHT LIKE NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHAT THREE FEET VERSES FOUR FEET REALLY LOOKS LIKE BUT WHAT THEY DO SO WE CAN ASK THEM HOW MANY FEET IT IS WE ALSO UE THESE OTHER MEASURES OF VISUAL MATCHING MEASURES TO KNOW THAT DISTANCE OF THE FINISH LINE LOOKS ABOUT AS FAR AWAY IS AS AS THIS OTHER TAR GET THEIR MATCHING UP THEIR VISUAL EXPERIENCES SO WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT IN DUCING THAT NARROWED FOCUS OF ATTENTION IS CREATING AN ILLUSION OF PROXIMITY THAT GOAL LOOKS CLOSER TO THEM AND THEN THERE'S ALL KINDS OF DOWN STREAM MOTIVATIONAL PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS THAT HAPPEN FROM FEELING LIKE YOUR CLOSER BY BY BY VISUALLY MISPERSEEVING THAT SPACE HEY CAN HAVE A REALLY POSITIVE CONSEQUENCE SO YOUR FIRST QUESTION WAS YOU KNOW WHICH WAY DOES IT GO DOES IT GO BOTH WAYS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE BETTER RUNNERS LIKE HAPPEND TO DO THIS THING YES SOME OF OUR RESEARCH SHOWIS THAT THAT IF THEY YOU KNOW FOR WHATEVER REASON HAPPENED UPON THIS STRATEGY AND CONTINUED TO PRACTISE IT THEY TEND TO BE THE BETTER RUNNERS BUT WE ALSO KNOW FROM OUR EXPERIMENCE IN THE LAB BUT WE TAKE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW ABOUT THESE STRATEGIES AND BY A FLIP OF THE COIN WE RANDOMLY ASSIGN THEM TO EITHER LEARN THE STRATEGY AND USE IT OR DO WHATEVER COMES NATURALLY TO THEM WE CAN CREATE THAT ILLUSION OF PROXIMITY THAT HAS AT DIRECT AND CAUSIL IMPACT ON IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE  WHEN THEY'R EXERCISING SO YES IT IT GOES BOTH WAYS THAT YOU CAN ALSO TEACH YOURSELF THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DISRELY ONUNLUCK LUCK OF THE DRAW FOR BEING A PERSON WHO HAPPENS TO BE THAT ER AT EXERCISING OR WHOSE EYES HAPPEN TO DO THIS ON THEIR ARM I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATH LETIC GREENS NOW CALLED AG ONE IS A VITAMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEENS I'VE BEEN TAKING OUTH LETIC GREEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THEREASON I STORY TAKING OUTH LETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE OUTH LETIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO ME THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GOT IS VERY IMPORTANT CE POPULATED BY GOT MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE MEAN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIOTICS ENOUTH LETIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ITH LETIC GREENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTIGENS VITEMENTS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTECRIPE IF YOU LIKE TO TRY OUTH LETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATH LETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUMORMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP OUTHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD IN THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TOO AGAIN THAT'S THAT LETIC GREENSTOCK CALM SLASH HUMORMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEM IND THREE K TO THE MOST PRESSING QUESTION I HAVE IN MY MIND IS CAN WE I ALL OF US USE THIS STRATEGY TO MAKE THE STARTING LINE A GOAL POINT BECAUSE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IT'S NOT ABOUT GOING FROM START TO FINISH IT'S ABOUT GETTING TO START AND YOU I WOULD SAY HERE I'M ESTIMATING BUT FIFTEEN PER CENT OF THE CONTENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS ABOUT MOTIVATION AND HOW TO GET MOTIVATED TO DO THINGS ON NOR CHEMICALS LIKE DOPAMEN OF COURSE BEING AT THE HEART OF MOTIVATION I IN MY MIND  MAKING STRONG LINKS BETWEEN SOME OF THESE VISUAL APERTURE EFFECTS AND GOLLINES AND DOPENINE A THAT WE COULD ALSO DIVE INTO BUT THE SIMPLE QUESTION IS CAN I USE THIS FINISH LINE STRATEGY TO MAKE THE START LINE A GOAL AND GET MY SYSTEM MORE ENGAGED OR MOTIVATED AND IS THERE ANY PHYSIOLOGY OR PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES I SHOULD SAY TO REFLECT THE IDEA THAT MAY BE JUST VISUALLY FOCUSSING ON THE START LINE WOULD ACSHL GET ME MORE EXCITED AS SUPPOSE TO MAKE ME LESS EXCITED TO ENGAGE IN EFFORT THERE' CERTAINLY VISION SCIENCE THAT'S TIED UP IN THAT VERY FIRST STAGE OF OF GOL SETTING IDENTIFING WHA THATCAL IS IN THE FIRST PLACE IN TAKING THUS FIRST STEPS A LOT OF PEOPLE'S GO TWO STRATEGIES TAT INVOLV VISION ARE OUR VISION BOARDS OR DREAM BORDS OR HOSTET NOTS RIHT THEYRE CREATING SOME SORT OF VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF WHAT IT IS THAT THEY WANT TO ACCOMPLISH WHERE IS IT THAT I WANT TO BE IN FIVE YEARS TEN DAYS TEN YEARS WHATEVER WHATEVER THAT TIME LINE IS THAT THEIR WORKING UNDER THE IDEA O VISION BOARDS OR DREAM BOARDS IS THAT YOU ALMOST LIKE A SCRAP BOOK  COLLECT VISUAL ICONS THAT REFLECT WHERE YOU WANT TO BE TO MOTIVATE YOURSELF THE REALLY COMMON TACTIC THAT PEOPLE USE AND IT'S NOT THAT TO DO THAT WRIGHT FOR SOME PEOPLE JUST EVEN KNOWING WHAT THEY WANT IN LIFE IS A MADE YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENT DEFINING THE GOAL CAN'T BE REALLY CHALLENGING FOR PEOPLE AND THAT'S ASTRATEGY THAT WORKS AND INVOLVES OUR VISUAL EXPERIENCE IT'S NOT JUST PEOPLE AREN'T SAYING LIKE WHAT N'T YOU JUST SIT AROUND AND AND IMAGIN WHAT YOU WANT YOUR LIFE TO BE LIKE IN TEN YEARS THE STRATEGY THAT PEOPLE ARE SUGGESTING IS LIKE KNOW CUT OUT THE PICTURES PUT IT ON A BOARD AND STICK IT BY YOUR BASSROOM MIRROR SO YOU SEE IT EVERY DAY RANIG A LIST MAKE A LIST IS WHAN I BEGON THESE LISTS I LOOD FRIENDS WIL YU HAVE MADE YOUR LIST YAD THE LIST OF THINGS THAT YOU INSIST ON HAVING IN THE CONTEXT OF TITNISS RELATION SHOULD JOB ITS ETTER ITS ETTER THE SEEMS WORN WORK HOME YAT TOTALLY IN THE IDEAS LIKE WRIT IT DOWN WRITHOR TELLING YOU WRITE IT DOWN LIKE OR OR CREATE A VISUAL MANIFESTATION OF IT A AND SO YAH THAT THAT'S EFFECTIVE FOR IDENTIFYING WHAT YOU WANT BUT IT MAY NOT ACTUALLY BE EFFECTIVE FOR HELPING YOU TO MEET THE GOAL TO GET THE JOB DONE SO COLLEAGUES OF MIN AT YOUR UNIVERSITY A HAVE PROBED WHY WHY IS THAT WHYS JUST INO THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT IN YOUR LIFE AND A INSTEAD OF PUTTING YOURSELF VICURIOUSLY INTO THOSE SHOES IMAGINING WHAT MY LIFE WILL BE LIKE IF I CAN ACCOMPLISH EVERYTHING ON THIS LIST WHY DOESN'T THAT WA WALFERS OF ALL DOES AT WORK THANCERS KNOW AND WHY DOES IT NOT WORK A BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS THESE COLLIGUES GABRYAL UTENGEN AND AND HER AND HER RESEARCHAM HAVE FOUND IS THAT ON A GOING THROUGH AND DREAMING ABOUT OR OR VISUALIZING HOW GREAT MY LIFE WILL BE WHEN I GET EXLIANSE DONE A THAT IS THAT IS LIKE A GOAL SATISFIED I HAVE IDENTIFIED WHAT IT IS THAT I WANT I'VE EXPERIENCED IT EVEN IF JUST IN AN IMAGINARY WAY I'VE HAD THAT POSITIVE EXPERIENCE OF O THINKING ABOUT WUT HOW GREAT MY LIFE IS GOINE TO BE WHEN I GET THIS THING DONE AND ITS STARCH A SORT OF REST ON THEIR LAURELS SHE'S ACTUALLY MEASURED SOSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE AND THEY FOUND THAT PEOPLE WHO DO THAT WHO GO THROUGH THAT EXPERIENCE O VISUALIZING HOW GREAT MY LIFE WILL BE WHEN I GET EXPIANSY DONE THE'RE THEY'RE SOSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE THE BOTTOM NUMBER ON YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE READING DECREASES OKEY NOW I'M ALL ABOUT FINDING WAYS TO RELAX ESPECIALLY IN NEW YORK RIGHT YOU'RE CONSTANTLY LIVING AT A HIGH LEVEL OF STIMULATION AND SO LIKE COOL GREAT SO MAYBE I SHOULD JUST LIKE THINK ABOUT HOW ASSON MY LIFE WILL BE WHEN I GET MY BUCK BYE BUCKETLESS DONE BUT MOTIVATIONS SCIENTISTS KNOW THAT SESTOLIC BLOOD PR SURE IS ACTUALLY AN INDICATOR OF OUR BODIES READINESS TICK IT UP AN ACT TO DO SOMETHING NOW THAT CAN BE THE GOING OUT FOR A WALK GOING OUT FOR A RUN HITTING THE GIM IT CAN ALSO BE THINGS LIKE DOING MAT PROBLEMS I EVEN IF IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S JUST MENTALS TO STALK BLY PRESSURE ACTUALLY GOES UP IN ANTICIPATION OF YOUR BODY OR YOUR MIND NEEDING TO DO SOMETHING TAKING THE FIRST STEPS ON A GOAL SO THEN IT IS IT HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND OF I OKE IF I'VE JUST CREATED THIS DREAM BOARD THIS VISION BOARD AND PUT MYSELF PSYCHO LOGICALLY IN THAT SPACE OF A GOAL SATISFIED WHY IS IT BAD THAT BLOOD PRESSURE GOES DOWN BECAUSE IT MEANS YOUR BODY IS CHILLING OUT IT'S LIKE IRE ACRAL I JUST ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING PRETTY MAJOR IAD ACTUALLY NOW DON'T HAVE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL RESOURCE IS AT THE READY TO TAKE THE FIRST STEP RIGHT NOW TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT SO SO THAT WAS A PRETTY MONU MENTAL I'M A FINE THING FROM MOTIVATION SCIENTISTS TO UNDERSTAND THATLY CREATING THESE DREAM BOARDS THESE VISION BOARDS OR TO DO THIS MIGHT ACTUALY BACK FIRE BECAUSE ITN  IN IT OF ITSELF IS THE CREATION OF A GOAL AND THE SFATISFACTION OF THE GOAL AND PEOPLE UNDERSTANDIBLY GIVE THEMSELVES SOME TIME TO DISENJOY THA POSITIVE EXPERIENCE SO MUCH FOR THE SECRET EXACTLY EXACTLY GUESS NOW THE SECRET FOLKS WILL COME AFTER ME  WORKS I TRI I NEVER SAY THE MAM I  I'M NOT FOR ANY SAY THE A O MY NI IMAGINE THAT CERTAIN STRATEGIES MYT WORK FOR THE PEOPLE BUT I EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING AGAIN IS CONSISTENT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE PHYSIOLOGY OF DOPOMIN CIRCUITS FOR MOTIVATION I 'VE OF A GOOD FRIEND WHO PERHAPS INCINCIDENTALLY PERHAPS NOT IS A CARDEOLOGIST AT A MAJOR UNIVERSITY SAID THAT A ONE OF THE MAJOR ERRORS THAT PEOPLE MAKE WITH BOOK WRITING IN COMPLETION IS THEY WILL TELL PEOPLE THEY GON TO WRITE A BOOK AND PEOPLE WILL SAY OH YOU DEAFUNLY SHOU WRITE A BOOK EVER ONES GATA LOF YOUR BOOK AND THE NEVER AND UPWRITING IT AND HIS THEORY IS THAT THEY GET SO MUCH DON'T PEME REWARD FROM THAT IMMEDIATE FEED BACK WITH ALL THE PROTECTION OF NEVER HAVING THE BOOK CRITICIZED THAT THEY NEVER WRITE THE BOOK I'M SURE THEIR EXCEPTIONS TO THIS BUT 'M I GUESS IT RAISES THE QUESTION WHAT'S THE BETTER STRATEGY YET SO I'M NOT SAYING THE PEOPLE WHO ENJOY A DREAM BOARD CREATION SHOULD STOP WITH THEIR DOING THAT'S NOT THE TAKE COME MESSAGE HERE AND IT MERBORD NO DEAFLY NOT THAT NOTHERE'S ENOGH ANXIETY IND FEAR IN THE WORLD WEE DONT EE DOING RIDGE MORE OF IN  BUT THE PROCESS OF GOAL SETTING SHON STOP WITH ARTICULATING WHAT THE GOAL IS A SO AT THAT SAME POINT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO WHAT WHAT IS MY VISION FOR THE FUTURE IN THOSE PLANNING SESSIONS WE NEED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY A THINK ABOUT A COUPLE OTHER THINGS ONE IS I HOW ARE WE CAN GET THERE SO TAKE IT OUT OF THE ABSTRACT TAKE IT OUT OF THIS I I DILIC OF VISUAL I CANOGRAPHY AND SARE THINKING ABOUT THE PRACTICAL DAY TO DAY WE NEED TO BREAK IT DOWN INTO MORE MANAGIBLE GOALS NOT JUST MY TEN YEAR PLAN FOR MYSELF BUT MY TO WEAK PLAN WHAT WHAT CAN I ACCOMPLISH IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS AND THE TWO WEEKS AFTER THAT'S GON TO SET ME ON THE RIGHT TRAJECTORY THAT'S PROBABLY NOT SURPRISING TEN NYBODY WHO'S BEEN THINKING ABOUT HOW DO I SET GOALS BETTER YOU KNOW PLAN PLAN BIG PICTURE THINK BING PICTURE ABSTRACTLY BUT THEN ALSO BREAK IT DOWN MORE CONCRETELY THAT'S PRBABLY NOT SURPRISING BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE GOAL SETTING PROCESS THEND AGAIN  GABRYEL OUTNGEN MI DEPARTMENT HAS IDENTIFIED A THIRD OFTEN OVERLOOKED YOUR UNDER APPRECIATED STAGE THAT HAS TO HAPPEN AT THAT GOAL IN THE GOAL SETTING PROCESS AND THAT'S THINKING ABOUT THE OBSTACLES THAT STAND IN YOUR WAY OF SUCCESS AND THAT IT WILL ACTUALLY HELP IMPROVE MOTIVATION IN THE LONG RUN AND SOMETIMES YOU WILL THINK THAT THAT LIKE HIS COUNTER IN TO ITIV YOU'RE SAYING FOR IF I WANT IT INCREASE MY MOTIVATION HAVE MORE MOTIVATION THAN I NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW HARD IT'S GOING TO BE ALL THE WAYS THAT I'M GOING A FAIL HOW IS THAT AN ALJAS ME UP HOWS I GOIN O HELP ME GET THROUGH WHEN I ACTUALLY YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN WHEN THINGS GET HARD BUT IT DOES BECAUSE IT'S LIKE COMING UP WITH A PLAN BE A PLAN SEE PLANDE IN ADVANCE OF ACTUALLY EXPERIENCING THAT IF YOU WERE ON A BOAT IN THE BOAT STARTED TO SINK THAT'S NOT THE TIME YOU WOEN T START LOOKING FOR LIFE JACKETS YOU AREDYO WANT O KNOWHER ONE IS SO YOU CAN GO TO IT RIGHT AWAY AND'S THE SAME THING WITH GOAL SETTING IS THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT ARE MY WORKING TOWARDS TIME YOAN TO GET THERE AND IF I EXPERIENCE THIS OBSTACLE HERE'S WHAT I'M N TA DO ABOUT IT YOU MAY NEVER EXPERIENCE THAT OBSTACLE BUT IF YOU DO YOU'E PROBABLY GON TO BE SHY ON TIME HEN ON RESOURCES MAYBE EXPERIENCING AN ANXIETY THAT HIGH JACTS YOUR BRAIN SO YOU'RE NOT FUNCTIONING AT THAT OPTIMAL LEVEL OF JUDGMENT DECISION MAKING HOU WANT AT ALREADY HAVE LIKE THE SNAP NEXT STEP IN PLACE SO YOU CAN JUST HOP TO IT MAY WE NOT CAN TO DO OUR BEST THINKING WHEN WE'RE IN CRISIS MODE A BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO IF WE HAVE USED IF WE HAVE ALREADY USED OUR RESOURCES IN ADVANCE TO COME UP WITH THAT PLAN BE OR THAT PLAN SEA MICHAEL PHELP'S LIKE INCREDIBLE ATHLETE RIGHT THIS IS A MAN THAT HE AND HIS COACH HAVE ROUTINELY INCORPORATED INTO THERE A INTO THEIR TRAINING SO I LOVE THE STORY THAT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HE WAS YOU KNOW HOT HOT FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE WAS THE BAJANG OLYMPIC MICHAEL FELPS WAS ON THE BRINK OF DOING SOMETHING THAT NO ONE ELSE IN THE HISTORY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES HAS EVER DONE WHICH HIS WHIN A GOLD METALS IN A SINGLE OLYMPIAD AT THE TIME OF THIS STORY HE HAD ALREADY ONE SETVEN AND HE HAD JUST THE TWO HUNDRED FLY IN FRONT OF HIM BEFORE HE COULD DO WHAT NO ONE ELSE HAS EVER DONE WHEN THE AITHGOLD METAL AND LIKE THE FLY IS HIS THING RIGHT THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN THIS SHOULD AVE BEEN EASY LIKE A NO BRAINER HE'S GOIN TO WIN THAS HE'S GOIN TO BREAK ALYMPIC HISTORY AS SOON AS HE DOVE IN TO THE POOL HIS GOGGLES STARTED TO LEAK AND BY THE TIME HE HAD DONE THREE LANGTS OF THE POOL HE JUST HAD TO FLIP AROUND AND AND COME BACK TO THE TO THE STARTING LINE FLASH VENISHE LYING BACK TO THE EDGE A BY THE TIME THAT HAPPENED HIS GOGGLES WERE COMPLETELY FILLED WITH WATER IN HEWAS SWIMMING BLIND I WOULD A PANIC I WOULD A SUNK TO THE BOTTOM A POOL I WOULDN HAVE T BEEN IN THE POOL TO BE HONEST LIKE I'M NOT A SWIMMER DEFLEY NOT GOING TO BE IN THE OLYMPICS BUT AH BUT FOR HIM HE DIDN'T IT WASN'T A MOMENT OF PANIC LIKE YOULD PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR NEARLY EVERY OTHER PERSON IN THAT SITUATION BECAUSE HE HAD FORESHADOWED T HAT KIND OF POSSIBLE FAILURE HE HAT IMAGINE THAT OBSTACLE HITTING HIM IN ADVANCE AND NOT EVEN TOS IMAGINED IT BUT PRACTICED AT WHAT WILL WE DO HE ROUTEENLE PRACTISED SWIMMING WITH HIS GOGGLES NOT FULLY SECURED ON HIS FACE COACH NOTORIOUSLY WUT IRIPPED THE GOGGLES OFF OF HIS HEAD SMASHD HIM ON THE GROUND FOR MAYBE DRAMATIC AF FACT OR SOMETHING SO THAT HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE ANY GOGGLES POSSIBLE TO GRAB AS HE'S AS HE'S IN PRACTICE SO BECAUSE HE HAD FORSHADOW THAT POSSIBILITY AN THE SOLUTION IF MY GOGGLES START TO LEAK THEN I WILL DO IN HIS CASE START COUNTING MY STROKES THEN I'LL MAKE IT THROUGH HE KNEW EXACTLY HOW MANY STROKES THIT WOULD TAKE FROM HIM TO GET ONE END OF THE POOL TO THE OTHER IS TARE TO COUNTING HIS STROKES HE ONE THAHE WON THAT RACE THE TWO HUNDRED FIVE ONE AS ATE COLD METAL AND YOU GOON TO WIN FIFTEEN MORE IN HIS CAREER SO E MIGHT NOT ALL BE SWIMMERS WE MIGHT NOT ALL SPIRE TO OLYMPIC LEVEL PERFORMANCE BUT I LOVE THAT EXAMPLE BECAUSE I THINK ITAT HELP SORT OF DE MISTIFY OR GIVE US AN ALTERNATIVE PERSPECTIVE ON THE IMPORTANCE I AND THE MOTIVATIONAL REASONS WHY THINKING ABOUT OBSTACLES AND ADVANCE THINKING ABOUT THE WAYS THE TWO THREE FOUR WAYS THAT YOUR PLAN MIGHT GO ARY IS ACTUALLY EFFECTIVE AT HELPING US TO OVERCOME THE OBSTACLE THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE LEAD US TO THROW IN THE TOWEL THAT'S AN BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE  I'M GOING TO SPRING BORD OFF THAT EXAMPLE TO ASK A QUESTION THAT HAS ALSO BEEN ON MY MIND WHICH IS IS THERE REALLY ANYTHING SPECIAL ABOUT VISION BECAUSE IN THE EXAMPLE YOU JUST GAVE IT WAS INDEED VISION THAT MICHAEL PHELPS WAS DEPRIVED OF AND IT WAS COUNTING STROKES COUNTING AS ANOTHER FORM OF INCREMENTAL MEASUREMENT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OBVIOUSLY AM THERE ARE OTHERS THAT COULD BE THE SENSATION OF OF THE HANDS SMACKING THE WATER BREAKING THE SURFACE OF THE WATER SO THERE ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT VARIABLES OR MATRICS THAT ONE COULD USE I COULD IMAGINE THAT SETTING OUT ON A LET SAY A THREE MILE RUN WHICH FOR ME AS A DECENT SINCE RUN IT'S WHEN I DO A YOU TIMES WE COME ALSO NOT A RUNNER BUT I TRYING COMPLETE SOME RUNS A FEW TIMES A WEEK AT VERY SLOW PACE JUST FROM MY HEALTH I COULD COUNT EVERY STEP THAT WOULD BE COUNT OF EXHAUSTING BUT IF I KNEW THAT THREE MILES WAS I MA AN A ESTIMATE HERE OUTN O A COUPLE O THOUSAND STEPS I COULD COUNT BACKWARD I COULD COUNT FORWARD A COUNT EVERY TEN AM I CONFESS I SPEND EVERY MORNING TRYING TO FYING SONLIGHT TO GET SUN MISE TO SET MY CIRCATIAN RHYTHM AND I DO A HUNDRED JUMPING JACKS SO I'M THE THE GUY PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT STRANGE ON THE STREET BUT SOMETIMES A COUNT EVERY TEND SOMETIMES ACCOUNT BACKWARDS ON THE AT COUNT FORWARD IS THERE ANY INDICATION THAT IT MATTERS OR IS IT SIMPLY THAT WE ATTACH SOME SORT OF MEANING TO THAT INCREMENT AND THE MODE OF OF REACHING THAT INCREMENT BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM LIKE THER SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT VISION MAYBE I'VE AN WILL BUT MORE WHY THAT IS BUT AT A VERY BASIC LEVEL HOW BROADLY OR  I WERE FINALLY SHOULD ONE SET THE INCREMENTS AND DOES IT MATTER IF YOUR COUNTING STAPS OR COUNTING STROKES IF YOU WE A MAYBE IT'S EVERY OTHER SONG YOU CAN LISTEN TO AN ENTIRE ALBL SOMETHING THAT I NOGH PEOPLE DO ANYTHOR YOUAN LISTEN TO A WHOLE PLAYLIST AND THEN LISTEN TO IT AGAIN AND YOU'RE GET A WRONG AS LONG AS THE PLAYLIST IS COMPLETED TWICE YOU CAN NOT RESEE SEE WHAT I'M GETTING ITBAT I KNOW PEOPLEARE GOING AWONT IMPLEMENT THESE TOOLS AND I HAVE TO GUESS THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS IS SOMEWHAT A INDISCRIMINANTE WHEN IT COMES TO THESE THINGS BUT THAT THET MIGHT ALSO BE SOME PECIFICITY I THINK VISION ESPECIAL AND I THINK YOU DO TOO A IT'S SO IN FOR FOR VARIETY OF REASONS WHEN YOU START YOU CAN REALLY NURT OUT ON HOW COOL THE BRAIN IS AND HOW COOL VISION IS WITHIN THE BRAIN AND WHEN YOU DO THAN YOU START TO FIND SOMETHINGS THAT MAKE VISION UNIQUE RIHT MORE MORE REAL ESTATE MORE NEUROLOGICAL CARTEX  REALESTATE IS TAKEN UP BY THE VISUAL SENSE THAN ANY OTHER SENSE MORE THAN TASTE TOUCH SMELL IT VISION GETS MORE REAL STATE GETS MORE NEUROLOGICAL PROCESSING SPACE THAN ANY OTHER SENSE WHY IS THAT WELL BECAUSE EVOLUTION HAS LET US TO PRIORATIZE THAT VISUAL THE VISUAL EXPERIENCE THERE'S SOME COOL ILLUSIONS WHERE LIK MAYBE SOMEBODY'S MOUTH IS DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN WHAT YOU'RE HEARING WHEN PEOPLE SAID I CREATE THESE LIKE IN A WEAR TRICKS THAT MIGHT GO ON YOU TOOBE AND GO VIRAL A AND AND PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO FIGUREOUT WHAT DID I HEAR WHAT DID I SEE HIS MOUTH DOING AND WHAT COMES UP IS THAT PEOPLE PEOPLE PRIORTIZE WHAT THEY SEE OVER WHAT THEY RE HEARING WHEN THE TWO ARE INCOMPATIBLE ORE KIND OF LIKE OUT O SINK EVERY TONE YET EVERY TIME RIGHT IF YOU HAVE TO BET ON IT BET ON BET ON WHAT IT IS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT RATHER THAN WHAT YOU'RE SEEING WHY IS THAT E I GESS A COUPLE OTHER THINGS YOU RIT LAT WE CAN SEE SUPERFIRE YOU CAN SEE LIKE A FLICKERING CANDLE ON OUR HORIZON IF IT WAS A TOTALLY IN A CLEAR SKY A SEVERAL MILES AWAY YOU CAN SEE THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STACION FLOATING UP IN THE IN THE NIGHT SKY RIGHT KHUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY OUR EYES ARE AMAZING AND A AND WE PRIORTIZE WHAT WE SEE THAT AND I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE WE NEVER WE RARELY  GET THE EXPERIENCE OF HAVING OUR VISUAL EXPERIENCE SECOND GUEST YOU KNOW OFTEN TIMES WERE HAVING CONVERSATION MAY BEEN ALLOWED RESTAURAN AND WE KNOW THAT WE DIDN'T HEAR THE PERSON RIGHT AND SO WE SAY THAT GOA' DID YOU SAY THAT OR LIKE I THOUGH YOU SAID THIS NOW IC KNOW I DIDN'T SAY THAT RIGHTS AN PEOPLE WILL CORRECT TO US WHEN OUR EARS GET IT WRONG OR WE'RE TASTING SOMETHING AMAZING AND WE CAN'T QUITE FIGURE OUT WHAT SPICES WERE IN HERE AND SO WE KNOW THAT OUR TONGUE ISN'T QUITE PICKING UP THE THE THE TASTE THE RIGHT WAY AND THAT'S WHY WE READ THE MANYOU TO SEE WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS OR WE ASKED THE SHEFF LIKE WHAT DID YOU PUT IN THIS IT TE AMAZING SO WE KNOW THAT OUR TONGUE IS GETTING IT WRONG ORE YOU MIGHT BE TOUCHING SOMETHING ANDYOU LOOK AT THE TAG TO SEE WHAT SORT OF TEXTYLE WAS USE IN THIS REALLY AMAZING PIECE OF CLOTHING THAT OU'RE LOOKING TO BY SO WE KNOW THAT OUR OUR SENSE OF TOUCH ISN'T QUITE GETTING IT RIGHT BUT RARELY DO WE HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE OF HAVING OUR EYES GET UP DATED WERE WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING I THINK I' LOOKING AT MY MOM OP NO ACTUALLYI WAS ACTUALLY MY HUSBAND  CAY LIKE THAT NEVER HAPPENS AM RIGHT THAT WE HAVE GOTIN VISION AS WRONG AS WE MIGHT GET ANY OTHER THING THAT THAT WE'RE EX ERIENCING THROUGH ANY OTHER SENSE WE TRUST OUR VISUAL EXPERIENCE WE HAVE A SORT OF A NAIVE REALISM THAT WHAT WE SEE REFLECTS THE WORLD THE WAY IT ACTUALLY IS BECAUSE IT'S NEVER REALLY FULLY TESTED WE NEVER GET THE INPET OR THE FEED BACK THAT YOU'VE SEEN SOMETHING WRONG INTILL A VISUAL LUSION POPS UP ON SOCIAL MEDIA RIHT LIKE THE DRESS EXAMPLL OR THE LAST WEEK OR SO THERE'S BEEN THAT HORSE SEAL LYINE DRAWING THAT'S BEEN ALL OVER SOCIAL MEDIA TO WHAT YOU SEE I SEE A HORSE OMSAS I SEE A SEAL ON THEM LIKE YEN O CHAOS OR RUPS OR I THOUGHT THE DRESS WAS BLUE  O I THOUGHT IT WAS GO I DON'T MEMBER THE OPTION CAUSE I SEE IT IS BLUE SO A RIGHT AND T AND IT'S LIKE DIVIDING UP FAMILIES AND FRIENDSHIPS BECAUSE YOU'VE LIKE SEEN SOMETHING THAT THE OTHER PERSON LITERALLY CANNOT SEE AND THAT'S WHY WE LOVE THOSE EXAMPLES WHEN THEY POP UP IN SOCIAL MEDIUM WHEN THEY DO IS BECAUSE IT DEFIES ALL OF OUR PREVIOUS EXPECTATIONS ERE'S A REALLY AMAZING IF IF THIS INTERESTS YOU I'M THERE'S A REALLY AMAZING VISUAL ARTISTS AND EACH KOPOOR WHO PLAYS WITH THESE IDEAS TOO AND HIS INSTALATIONS ARE OR JUST FASCINATING I SAW ONE AAT A MUSEUM ONCE WHERE AN I WALK DOWN THIS LONG HALL AND IS JUST A BIG BLACK ERECTANGLE THAT'S PAINTED ON THE WALL S LIKE THIS KRIS SUPERFAMOUS WHAT THE HELL I'S JUST A BIG BLACK ERECTANGLE PAINTED ON THE WALL WHAT IS THIS ABOUT BUT OXE NOW THIS MUSIUM PAID HOW MUCH BUT  WHATEVER BUT THEN AS YOU GET CLOSER YOU GET CLOSER IN YOUR EYES STRETH TO SETTLE IN AND THE ADAPT TO THE DIFFERENT VISUAL LIGHTING REALISE IT'S NOT A BLACK SQUARE PAINTED ON THE WLL IT' A HUGE HOLE HE'S CARVED INTO THE WALL AND THERE IS A WHOLE OTHER WORLD THAT'S BACK BEHIND THER THAT YOU CAN'T SEE RIGHT AWAY UNTIL YOUR EYES ADAPT TO THE DIFFERENT LIGHTING CONDITIONS IS AMAZA VISIONS O I HAV TO SEE WORDS AS SEXUM IT'S NOT UPRIGHT NOW I'VE I'VE SEEN AM THERE WAS A RETROSPECTIVE SEVERAL YEARS AGO THAT WAS DONE A INSIDNEY UH BUT HIS WORK IS ALL OVER THE PLACE SO A NICHKOPOR DOTHLY DEFINLLY WORTH LOOKING UP BECAUSE BECAUSE IT ON LIKE THE DRESS EXAMPLE OR THE HORSE SEAL LINE DRAWING OR ARTIST LIKE ANICHKOPOR'S WORK THAT IS A MOMENT THAT THAT GIVES US A DIFFERENT UNEXPECTED INSIGHT  ABOUT THE WORLD THAT IT CHALLENGES US TO TO SEE SOMETHING THAT WE HADN'T SEEN BEFORE OR IT INDUCES OR TRICKS US INTO SEEING SOMETHING THAT WE WOULDN'T 'F OTHERWISE HAVE SEEN A IT SO IT'S THOSE RARE MOMENTS THAT I THINK ARE ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING WHAT TO OUR EYES NORMALLY DO BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T FIND THESE EXAMPLES SO SURPRISING SO ENGAGING SO SHOCKING IF WE HAD ROUTINELY GOT THE EXPERIENCE OF REALIZING WHERE NOT SEEING THE WORLD THEWAY THAT IT IS SO THAT IS WHY I THINK VISION IS IS SPECIAL AND WHY IT'S IT CAN BE THOUGHT OF IS A TOOL THAT WE CAN ADD TO OUR TOOL KIT A FOR HOW TO BETTER ACCOMPLISH OUR GOALS I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE SHOULD ONLY FOCUS ON IMAGINING THE WORLD THROUGH A AN ATTENTIONAL SPOT LIGKT BUT MAYBE THT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN EMPLOYS TROTEGICALLY ON OCCASION WHEN WE THINK IT'S GETTING BEST T HELP US WHEN WE NEED AN EXTRA LITTLE PUSH TO CROSS THAT PHIS THE LITERAL OR METAPHORICAL FINISHE LINE BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE ONLY TACTIC THAT WE USE JUST LIKE IT'S NOT BAD TO USE VISION BOARDS BUT LET'S USE SOMETHING ELSE ALSO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT BAD TO TALK TO OURSELVES IN ENCOURAGING WAYS BUT LET'S TRY ADDING ANOTHER TOOL TO OUR TOOL BELT I IN CASE THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO GET THE JOB DONE SO I DO THINK THAT THERE'S GREAT POWER IN THINKING ABOUT OUR VISUAL EXPERIENCE ALONGSIDE OTHER TACTICS THAT WE MIGHT USE FOR MEETING OUR GOALS AND ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE TACTICS MIGHT BE LIKE THE THE NEW MERRICS THAT YOUR TALKING ABOUT HOUE HOW DO I THINK ABOUT MIG JUMPING JACKS IN TERMS OF GROUPS OF TEN OR AS A SET OF A HUNDRED YOU DO IT ROUTINELY SO YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SET A GOAL OF A HUNDRED AND HAVE THAT SUSTAIN YOU THROUGH NUMBER SIXTY NUMBER SEVENTY WHEN MAYBE ITS STARTYING TO GET HARDER BUT FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S JUST STARTING OUT AND WANTS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT TO A HUNDRED THAT'S PROBLY NO CAN WORK THAT'S GOING TO BE MAYBE REALLY THAT COULD BE QUITE CHALLENGING FOR THEM IF IT'S THE FIRST TEN THATHERE TRYING IT AND SO INSTEAD SETTING THOSE MICRAL GOALS OF GROUPS OF TEN ITS GOIN TO BE USEFUL BECAUSE AS WE START TO GET TO NUMBER EIGHT OR NINE OR NUMBER EIGHTY EIGHT OR EIGHTY NINE AND IT'S REALLY GETTING HARD WE NEED THAT EXTRA LITTLE HIDONIC HIT OF PLEASURE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT THE MIGROW DOPLAMEAN RUSH THAT YOU MIGHT GET BY HITTING ANOTHER TEN NOTHER DECADE MILES DOWN ANOTHER GROUP OF TEN MILES STONE AND WANC TO BE GET THAT LITTLE HIT OF PLEASURE EXCITEMENT ORE SELF CONGRATULATIONS THAT MIGHT BE ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN US THROUGH THE NEXT CHALLENGING PHYSICAL OBSTACLE THE NEXT GROUP OF TEN THAT WE MIGHT EXPERIENCE SO THERE ISN'T ANY LIKE PRESCRIPTION THAT I WOULD GIVE AND SAY EVERY PERSON SHOULD DECIDE THAT TWENTY FIVE JUMPING JACKS IS THE GOAL NO WE HAVE TO BE IDIOSENCRATIC AND IN INTROSPECT ABOUT WHERE WE AT WITH THIS GOAL THIS THING THAT I'M TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND SET THOSE GOALS REALISTICALLY BUT INSPIRATIONALLY AS WELL WE ONT A SET A GOAL THAT WILL CHALLENGE US BUT ISN'T IMPOSSIBLE WE DON'T WAN TO SET GOALS THAT ARE TOO EASY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT IN A TRICK OURSELVES IN A LIKE FEELING SO GREAT ABOUT DOING ONE JUMPING JACK  PEY GREAT LYPRETTY SURE MUST PEOPOAL IF THAT'S A GOAL THEY CAN DO ONE SO EUGEN A FEEL SO GREAT WHEN YOU HIT THACAL NO BECAUSE IT WAS TOO EASY YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY DOUBT THAT YOU COULD DO THAT ONE BUT WHAT ABOUT TWENTY FIVE OGE THAI MAGH FEEL PRETTY GOODABOUT THAT WILL HAT ABOUT THE NEXT GROUP OF TWENTY FIVE AND NOW I'M AT FIFTY THOSE OR GALS THAT MIGHT SEEM JUST BEYOND THE BRINK OF WHAT'S POSSIBLE BUT I WILL FEEL GOOD WHEN I HIT THAT AND NOTS GAN IT GIVE ME THE NEXT SORT OF BOOST OF ENERGY THAT I'MEAN A NEED TO GO A LITLE BET FURTHER EITHER THAT TIME OR THE NEXT TIME YI THINK VISION IS SPECIAL AGAIN I'M STRONGLY BAS TO YOUR MY YOUTHE REASON I I INITUALLY LEARN ABOUT YOUR WORK O WAS WELL NOW YOU HAVE THIS AMAZING BOOK BUT AT THE TIME THERE WASN'T THE BOOK THER WERE JUST THE SCIENTIFIC PAPERS AND OF COURSE UPON WHICH THA THE BOOK REST O AND THOSE PAPERS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT WHAT WAS THE RELATIONSHOIPD BETWEEN VISION AND I OBVIOUSYIS OUR SENSE OF SPACE BUT HOW THE SENSE OF SPACE AND TIME ORE RELATED AND TO ON THE THE IDEA QUITE SIMPL FO THOS LISTENING YOU KNOW WHEN YOU NARROW YOUR VISUAL WINDOW YOUR MEASURING THE TIME BEN ALSO GET SMALLER RIGHT WHICH MAKE SENSE WHEN YOU HEAR IT WEREAS IF YOU TAKE ON A HUGE VISUAL LANDSCAPE YOU ASHY CARVING UP TIME DIFFERENTLY IT SOR LIKE MOVING FROM A SLOW FRAME RATE TO A FINE FRAME RATE OU N A SLOW MOTION CAMERA AS ASHALY TAKING A LOT MORE SNAP SHOTS RISESY MEASURING DISTANCE OVER TIME MORE FINELY AND SO WERE STRODE WOULD BE THE OTHER EXAMPLE WHICH AS STRODE IS VERY LOW FREQUENCY SO YOU'RE GOING HERE HERE HERE AS OPPOSED TO OU N A SLOW MOTION RIHT STRODE GVES A A COURSE A THE COURSE VIEW INTO THE TIME DOMAIN AND HIGH SPEED FOR TARDBY GIES A FIME YOU IN THE TIME TO MAKE SO I'M ALMOST CERTAIN WITHOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE OF UNDERLINE DATE A AM I'M BUT KNOWLEDGE OF THE MECHANISM THEM I AM ALMOST CERTAIN IF NOT CERTAIN THAT BY PLACING A NARROW VISUAL APERTURE WE CHANGE THE WAY WE PERCEIVE TIME NOW I HAVE A QUESTION AND I TO BE OS I KNOW THE ANSWER IN ADVANCE BUT I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO TELL US A BIT ABOUT HOW SOME OF THIS WORKS STILL FURTHER IN REVERSE MEANING HOW UNFIT PEOPLE VIEW THE WORLD VERSES HOW FIT PEOPLE O THER WORLD OR HOW UNMOTIVATED PEOPLE VISUALLY SEE THE WORLD AS SOPPOSED TO HIGHLY MOTIVATED PEOPLE Y YOU TALKED ABOUT THE EASYLY RUNNERSE YIVE THE MICHAEL PHELPS AS EXAMPLE BUT A'M MAYBE COULD DESCRIBE THAT STUDY I THINK IT'S A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT ONE MOSTLY BECAUSE YES IT IDENTIFIES A PERHAPS OF PHYSIOLOGICAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MOTIVATED AND UNMOTIVATED OR OR A FIT AND UNFIT PEOPLE BUT IT ALSO PROVIDES A A PATH TO TO REMEDY THAT YES O U NO THERE'S OUT OF MY LAB BUT ALSO OUT OF SEVERAL OTHER LABSERS BEEN WORK LOOKING LOOKING AT THAT RELATION BETWEEN STATES OF THE BODY AND VISUAL EXPERIENCE AS I'M THEY HAVEN'T NECESSARILY TRIED TO TO TO INTEGRATE THE MOTIVATION SCIENCE ELEMENT I'M TO IT BUT THEY WERE LOOKING TO SEE DIVISUAL EXPERIENCES CHANGE AS A FUNCTION OF DIFFERENT STATES OF OUR BODIES SO THEY LOOKED AT PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE CHRONIC FATIGUE I'M THE ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO ARE OVERWEIGHED IM THOSE THAT OUR IN WEARING WEARING HEAVY BACK PACKS AND SO WVE AR SORT OF PUT INTO THAT EXPERIENCE OF BEING OVER WEIGHT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF THE ENVIRONMENT WHAT THEY FIND IS THAT DISTANCES LOOK FURTHER TO THOSE THAT ARE OVERWEIGHT CHRONICALLY TIRED OLDER RATHER THAN YOUNGER WEIGHTED DOWN WITH I WITH EXTRA BAGGAGE I'M DISTANCES LOOK FURTHER IN HILLS LOOKS STEEPER WE'VE WE'VE DONE SOME OF THESE STUDIES TOO WHERE WE TRY TO I GIVE PEOPLE MOR ENERGY OR OR DEPRIVED THEM OF OF ENERGY ENSEE DOES THAT CHANGE THEARE THEIR PERCEPTION OF SPACE AND  WE DID THAT BY  KNOW I SORT OF CLASSIC TACNEQUE OF A DOUBLE BLIND STUDY WHERE THE PRACTICEMEN DOESN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THEIR EXPERIENCEING A THOOUNG A SA DOUBLE ESPRESSO THAT IS ALSO I GOD PSYCHOLAGICAL EXPERIENCE TO GIVE PEOPLE A Y SO YOU KNOW A DOUBLE BLIND EXPERIMENT WHERE THE PARCUSBEEN DOESN'TREALLY KNOW THE THE FULL EXTENT OF WHAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING A THEIR EXPERIENCING AND AND THE RESEARCH OR WHOSE INTER ACTING WITH THEM ALSO DOESN'T YOU DON THEY DO THIS A LOTED MEDICAL STUDIES YOT GIVE SOMEBODEA A DRUG AND YOU GIVE SOMEBODY A PLACIBO A SUGAR PILL AND THEN IMPORTANTLY NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHO'SE GOT WHAT UNTILL YOU'VE ANALYZED ALL THE DATA AND THE RESULTS ARE REVEALED THAT THAT THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT THAT HAD THE DRUG THE ACTIVE AGENT SAME IDEA IND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH AN THIS CASE WHAT WE DID IS GIVE PEOPLE COOLAD TO DRINK AND FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT COOLAD WAS SWEETENED WITH SUGAR AND ACTUAL COLORIC ENTITY IT COULD GIVE THEM ENERGY OTHER PEOPLE DRANK COULD SWEETENED WITH SPLENDA SO YE IT'S SWEET BUT IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T HAVE ANY COLORIC VALUE YOU'RE NOT GIVING PEOPLE ENERGY YOU'RE JUST GIVING THEM THAT THAT EXPERIENCE A OF OF SWEETNESS NOW SOME PEOPLE OF COURSE ARE REALLY GOOD IT IDENTIFYING LIKE WHAT'S WHAT'S REAL SUGAR IN WHAT SPLENDA BUT WHEN YOU PUT IT IN A COOLAD A PRETTY NOXIOUS POWDER IT ACTUALLY MASKED IT FOR EVERYBODY AND NOBODY HAD ANY IDEA AS IT IS LIKE GORBIT  LI GARP A YOU GO  I LA AN I'M SURE THER MANY PEOPLE THAT LOVE COOLY BY YAS ELS AR COOLAD WUL WLL REVEAL TE THEER YE I GREW UP IN NEBRASCA ACTUALLY WHERE COUOLADE IS FROM IT ORIGINATED IN NABRASKA SO I DO FEEL LIKE I'M BETRYING MY ROUTS SLAGLY BY IM BY CASTING SOME SHADE ON COULAD BUT A BUT BUT THAT'S HOW IT WORKED IS THAT YOU KNOW WE ASKE THEM TO GUESS WHAT THEY GOT WE TESTED THEM AFTERWARDS AND THEY WERE WRONG SO NOBODY IS ABLE TO GUESS A WITH ACCURACY WHAT WAS YOURE DRINK SWEETENED WIT WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY WERE BLIND THAE THE WAY THAT SCIENTISTS USE THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS THAT THEY WERE DRINKING WE GIVE IT A YOU KNOW WE GIVE THEM ABOUT TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR THAT SUGAR TO METABOLIZE AND WE MEASURED A THEY'RE CIRCULATING BOOD BLUCOSTS LEVELS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD IN FACT TO GIVEN THEIR BODY CIRCUTLY NO CIRCULATING BLUE COAST ENERGY THAT THEY MIGHT USE IN THE NEXT IM ACTIVITY AND A AND THE RESEARCH AR AGAIN DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER THEY HAD JUST SERVED SUGAR OR SPLENDA THEN WE ASKE PEOPLE TO ESTIMATE DISTANCE SO WE GAVE SOME PEOPLE MORE ENERGY OR WE KEPT OTHERS SORT OF AT LIKE WHATEVER THEIR NORMAL LEVEL WAS AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT BUT WHO HAD BEEN GIVEN MORE ENERGY BY DRINKING COOLID SWEETENED WITH SUGAR PERCEIVED THEIR SPACE AS AS MORE CONSTRICTED THEY THAT VISUAL ILLUSION OF PROXIMITDY WAS IN DUCED THEY FELT THAT THEIR FINISH LYINE AGAIN IN THE CONTECTS OF AN EXERCISE TASK WAS CLOSER TO THEM SO IN JUST THE SAME WAY THAT THESE OTHER PHYSIOLOGY LABS VISION SCIENCE PHYSIOLOGY LABS FOUND THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE CHRONICALLY TIRED WHO DON'T HAVE DON'T FEEL LIKE TO HAVE AS MUCH ENERGY OR THOSE THAT AURE PHYSICALLY WEIGHTED DOWN AND FOR WHOM IU MOVING WITHIN AN ENVIRONMENT IS MORE COSTLY A WE COULD CREATE THAT EXPERIENCE FOR PEOPLE WE DIDN'T EXPERIMENTAL VERSION OF THAT THAT IF YOU HAVE MORE ENERGY THE WORLD LOOKS EASIER THE DISTANCES TO HAVE FINISH LINE O LOOK AS FAR SO THAT WAS SOME THE EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE THAT WE HAD I'M TO SHOW THAT PEOPLE STATES THEIR BODY DO IMPACT THEIR VISUAL EXPERIE ENCE NOW I'M A MOTIVATION RESEARCHER SO FOR ME THE BIG QUESTION IS WELL WHAT'S THE POINT OF THAT STUDY THEN BESIDES TO SHOWING THIS CONNECTION BETWEEN THE BODY AND THA EYEIS IN THE VISUAL EXPERIENCE WE THINK THAT THAT'S FUNDAMENTAL TO ONE OF THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY WHEN THEIR EXERCISING WHEN IT'S REALLY HARDER FOR YOUR BODY BECAUSE OF ITS PHYSICAL STATE TO MOVE WITHIN A SPACE WHY DON'T WANT  YOU MIGHT SAY LIKE A WHYN O HEY TOS GO EXERCISE BECAUSE THE WORLD LOOKS HARDER TO THEM BECAUSE THAT DISTANCE THAT THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO WALK BECAUSE A DOCTOR TELLS THEM TO OR THAT A PARTNER ENCOURAGES THEM TO OR A HILL THAT THEY SHOULD HIHE UP BECAUSE SOMEONE TOLD THEM THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THEIR HEALTH IT LOOKS MORE CHALLENGING TO THEM THAN IT DOES TO SOMEBODY WHO ISNAT WHO WH IS IN WHOSE INPISIN BETTER PHYSICAL HEALTH NOW IF IT LOOKS THAT WAY IF IT LOOKS HARDER IF IT FEELS LIKE IT MIGHT BE HARDER THEN PSYCHOLOGICALLY WE KNOW THAT IT IS WHEN YOU HAVE SET YOURSELF UP PSYCHOLOGICALLY MENTALLY FOR THAT KIND OF FAILURE EXPERIENCE I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT TO GET THIS JOB DONEIS THIS LOOKS REALLY HARD YOU'RE ALREADY MOTIVATIONALLY IN A PLACE I FOR THIS TASK TO BE CLOSER TO IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU SO TO PUT IT ALTOGETHER THEN WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT PEOPLE WHOSE BODIES MIGHT MAKE IT MORE CHALLEGING THE FOR THEM TO EXERCISE I'M ALR SEEING THE WORLD IN A MORE CHALLENGING WAY AND THAT IS HAVING THESE DOWNSTREAM MOTIVATIONAL IN PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS THAT MAKES IT LESS LIKELY FOR THEM TO TRY TO TAKE ON THE TASK IN THE FIRST PLACE OR TO EXPERIENCE IT AS HARDER THAN THAN OTHER PEOPLE WOULD OR DO A IS THE SOLUTION THE SAME HOWEVER MEANING IF THESE PEOPLE ARE TAUGHT TO ADJUST THEIR VISUAL GO LINE OR TO SET A VISUAL S SPOTLIGHT ON AN INTERMEDIATE GOL CAN THEY OVERCOME SOME OF THIS A THIS CHALLENGE THAT THEY FACE SIMPLY BY VIRTUE OF THEIR SCUE PERCEPTION YES SO IN ALL OF THE STUDIES THAT WE HAVE DONE A'M LOOKING AT THAT CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS NARROWED FOCESS OF ATTENTION AND IMPROVEMENTS AN EXERCISE WE DO NOT FIND THAT IT ONLY WORKS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN SHAPE OR THAT A BACK FIRES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT OF SHAPE IT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY THIS IS A STRATEGY THAT EVERYBODY CAN ADOPT BECAUSE IT'S JUST SIMPLY ABOUT I WHAT AR YOU ALLICATE ATTENTIONAL RESOURCES TO WHAT ARE YOU SORT OF IGNORE AND WHAT ARE YOU FOCUS ON AND THAT IN THAT VISUALLY INDUCES THE SAME KIND OF ILLUSION FOR EVERYBODY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOUR OVERWEIGD OR YOUR OR YOUR AT YOUR TARGET WEI OR FOR STRUGGLING TO GET THEIR ARE EVARDY ACCOMPLISHED WHERE YOU WANT TO BE THAT VISUAL LUSION CAN BE INDUCED FOR EVERYBODY AND IT HAS THE SAME KINDS OF CONSEQUENCES TERRIFIC REALLYER I MADE A JOKE ABOUT DOUBLES PRESSO BUT NOW MAKE A SERIOUS STATEMENT ABOUT DOUBLES BRESSO WHICH IS THAT IT CONTAINS CAFFINE ON CAFFINE IS A STIMULANT LIKE ALL OTHER STIMULANTS A CAUSE A CHANGE IN OUR VISUAL WORLD IM THE MOST SAILENT ONE IS THE ONE THAT PLECE OFFICERS LOOK FOR APPARENTS SUSPECTING THAT THEIR KITS HAVE A INJUSTED SUBSTANCES OF ANY KIND LOOK FOR WHICH IS IF SOMEBODY'S PUPILS ARE UNUSUALLY LARGE FORGIVEN VISUAL ENVIRONMENT U THAT IS IN INDICATION OF HIGH LEVELS OF OTANOMY CAROUSAL I IN THE STREET DRUG TRANSLATION OF THIS ION OF PEOPLE TAKE INFEDIMING OR COCANE WAVERY BIPUPILS PEOPLE VERA RELAX OF SMALL PEOPLES HOWEVER EVER ONCE YOU KNOW THAT PEUPIL SIZE ALSO IS DYNAMICALLY REGULATE BY HOW BRIGHT OFVISUAL ENVIRONMENT SO THERE MULTIL THINGS CONTROLLING PUPIL SIZE HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE ARE VERY STRAST WERE VERY AROUSED IN ANY WAY POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE THE PUPILS GET BIG BUT WITHIN THE VISUAL SYSTEM WHATH THAT ETQUAITS TO IS A NARROWING IN THE VISUAL APERTURE SO RATHER THAN JUSTING SUGAR WHICH HAVEN'T GUESSING MOST OF THE WORLD CERTAINLY THE YOU ASKNESTIN JUST LEST SUGARLY THAT'S OVER HERIN OSUR THER FEW SUGAR YOU SUCRENISE DOES OUT THEIR SUCROSISEOS WHO WILL ALSO COME AFTER ME WITH PITCH FORKS BUT LET'S FACE IT MOST PEOPLE PRODU BETTER OFF IN JESTING LESS SIMPLE SUGAR BUT KAFFINE IS A GREAT MOTIV ATOR BECAUSE OF THE INTERNAL SENSE OF AROUSAL BUT IT ALSO NARROWS ARFISUAL WINDOW I COULD IMAGINE USING HEALTHY AMOUNTS OF KAFFINE COMBINED WITH A MAY EVEN BLINDERS OF THE SORT THAT O HORSES WERE MAY BE LIKE A HOODY AN A HANT A MAYBEEN BLINDERS IN ORDER TO GET OVER SOME OF THOSE MORE CHALLENGING MILSTONES AS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING THIS WITHOUT ON WELL OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE ARE DOING IT WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OF HOW IT WORKS BUT ARE THERE ANY STUDIES LOOKING AT HOW ADRENNALIN OR APONEFERIN OR ANY OTHER STIMULANTS IN PACT MODIVATION I DON'T KNOW HONESTLY YE I MEAN ENERGY DRINKS OR A BIG THING NOW YE YET FOR FOR SURE THEY ARE IM AND YOU KNOW IF IF YOU ACTUALLY ARE MORE PHYSIOLOGICALLY AROUSED OR JAS OR WHATEVER HE KNOW JUMPED UP OR YOU JUST THINK YOU ARE  IN OUR STUDIES WE HAVE FOUND THAT THEY WORK IN THE SAME WAY THAT IT CAN PRODUCE THE SAME KINDS OF CONSEQUENCS SO AND I LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT TELLS US THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE TE STATE OF YOUR BODY TO INDUCE THESE KINDS OF EXPERIENCE SAYS OR YOU CAN TREAD O YOU CAN JUST THINK THAT YOU CAN DRICK YOURSELF YOU CAN PLACEBO AFFECT YOURSELF OUT AND PRODUCE THE SAME KINDS OF EFFECTS I HAD TO GIVE UP COFFEE LIKE TWELVE YEARS AGO AN NOT BECAUSE NOT FOR ANY STORY I LOVE THE TASTE AND SO O KAFF IS MY JAM BUT IT CAN'T DRINK THE KAFFINE BECAUSE IT IT DIDN'T ACTUALLY DO THE THING THAT IT DOES FOR SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE LIKE MAKE ME FEEL MORE ENERGISE AND MORE AWAKE I JUS GOT SWEADY AND GENTERY AND ANXIOUS AND A CON FOCUS AS SOME PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE EY FAIRLY HIGHBASE LINE LEVEL OF THE TENSION AND MOTIVATION THEY FIND TIT PUTS THE AUTONOMIC SEE SAW TOO FAR IN THE SIMPATHETIC TONE YE NO AND I HAPPEN TO MARRY THE SAME KIN PERSON HE ALSO CAN'T DRINK KAFFIN BUT LOVES THE TASTE O COFFEE THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT WE BOTH HAVE TO HAVE COFFEE IN THE MORNING TO FEEL LIKE WE'RE READY TO GO FOR THE DAY SO IT'S JUST PART OF OUR ROUTIN OR WHATEVER TO HAVE THAT TASTE AND HAVE THAT SENSATION TO FEEL LIKE A READY TO TAKE ON THE DAY EVEN THOUGH I MEAN YAD YE CAF STILL HAS SOME CAFFINE IN I BUT WERE NOT DRINKING THAT MUCH OF IT TO PROBABLY ACTUALLY CREATE A KAFFINATED EXPERIENCE IN OUR BODY BUT TRICKING OURSELVES SACHOLOGICALLY AND TO ANTO DOING THAT THING THAT IN YEARS PASS USED TO WORK FOR US BOTH IM S THAT'S A MEAN TO KEEP IN MIND LIKE YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT HAVE A HOODIY THAT YOU CAN WEAR TO INDUCE THAT VISUAL AN ALLUSION OR YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE POWER OF YOUR MIND AT THE END OF THE DAY I'M A PSYCHOLOGISTS AND I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE SOME NON SERAL POWER OVER WHAT OUR MIND IS DOING WHAT WERE THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE ALLIKA OR ATTENTION TO I'M THAT CAN DO THE TSAME KIND OF THING THAT A HOOD IE MIGHT DO OR THA CUP OF CAFINE MIGHT DO I I COMPLETELY AGREED THE VISUAL APERTURE IS UNDER OUR CONSCIOUS CONTROL THAT'S AN AMAZING FEATURE OF ORIGUAL SYSTEM WE CAN NARROW OR EXPAND IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT AF PRACTICE I THING FOR PEOPLE THAT LEARN HOW TO DO THIS WITHOUT MOVING THEIR HEAD AROUND TO EXPAND THEIR VISUAL APERTURE AND HOW TO NARROW IT UWHAT I WAYS TELL PEOPLE IS A JUST IMAGINE A REALLY TROUBLING TEX MESSAG YURE OF REALL EXCITING TEXT MESSAGE COMING IN ALSAND YOU FORGET ABOUT THE WORLD AROUND YOU SO IT'S IT'S IT CAN BE TRIGGERED BY THESE OUTSIDE EVENTS AND WE CAN LEARN HAD TO ANCHOR ORVISUAL ATTENTION AD LOVE TO ASK ABOUT OTHER KINDS OF GOALS MEANING NON PHYSICAL GOALS BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE AR TRYING TO READ MORE I WOULD HOPE AM OR OR MUSIC OR A LANGUAGE OR THINKGS THAT REALLY IN VOLVE COGNITIVE GOAL LINES OR A INTERNAL GOAL LINES YOU KNOW READING ONE CHAPTER OUT OF A BOOK EACH NIGHT IS A TANGABL GOAL AM THE OTHER THAT I'VE OFTEN WONDERED ABOUT OR THESE AM SYSTEMS THAT ALLOW YOU TO HIGH LIGHT INDIVIDUAL LINES OR EVEN WORDS ON A PAGE THAT'S VERY VISUAL OBVIOUSLY AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS ROLLED OUT EXCEPT THAT WORD I'VE ALWAYS WISH FOR BOOKS THAT WOULD NATURALLY HIGH LIGHT EACH PAGE AS I SAY THE SOME ONE PUT IN THE COMMENTS AS PROBLE EXISTED FOR TEN YEARS AND I'M JUST SHOWING HOW WHEN A LOD I IAM BUT AM IS THERE ANY EXAMPLE THAT OR RE TACTIC THAT PEOPLE COULD USE TO AM BETTER APPROACH COGNIVE GOALS AT SCHOOL WOR RECREATIONAL TO WHEN THAT DON'T EXIST IN IN THE KIND OF FITNESS AND SPORT STOMAHOTY YES SO JUST AS SHOT OUT TO MY BROTHER IN LAW WHO HAS DONE SOME OF THAT RESEARCH A WHERE IT DOES HIGH LIGHT DIFFERENT PARTS OF WORDS AND PARAGRAPHS AND YOE SOUNDED TO BE IN EFFECTIVE WAY FOR ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE O LEARNERS TO TO PICK IT UP THAT THAT IS THAT KIING THAT VISION TO THE PROCESS OF LEARNING LANGUAGE IS EFFECTIVE AND IM SO THERE'SEEN A WHOLE COOL BODY OF  IV WORK AND RESECH AS LOOKING AT THAT SAY YOU WRITE ABOUT THAT IF YOU WANT TO MENTION WHAT HE DOES I A IS IS OR PLACE THAT PEOPLE CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT WE CAN PROVIDE LINKS I AME  WE WON'L PROVIDE LY  TY SOURCES I WANT THE NIS OR Y AND TRY N TO LEARN A SICOND LANGUAGE FROLONG TI I WON'TE I SPEAK SPANISH PRETTY WEAKLY BUT I AUD LOVE TO GET BETTER AT  A OLL PRRTULATOR MY FIVE YEAR OLD SUN SPEAK SPANISH BETTER THAN I DO AT THIS QUAINT SO II YES SO YOU KNOW I WAS THINKING THAT TO EN OF WE WE STARTED THIS WORK WITHIN THE CONTEX OF EXERCISE BUT OF COURSE THAT'S NOT PEOPLE'S ONLY GOAL THAT THEY HAVE IN LIFE IM AND IN I IT ISN'T MINE EITHER YOU KNOW I HAVE INTEREST OUTSIDE OF OF IMPROVING MY EXERCISE GAME A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHEN WHEN I WAS WRITING THE BOOK I I ALSO HAD A CHILD THE SAME THE SAME MONTH THAT I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIKE PULL ALL THIS RESEARCH TOGETHER IS THE SAME MONTH THAT THAT MYSUN CAME TO BE AND AND I STARTED TO REALIZE LIKE I BECAME A LOT LESS INTERESTING ONCE TEA WAS AROUND HE WAS FASCINATING BUT I WAS CHANGING DIBERS AND FEEDING A IN LIKE THAT WAS IT PEOPLE COME OVER LIKE WHAT'S AT AVE YOU BEEN I TELL ME SONMIENG THAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE AND LIKE ALL I HAD TO TALK ABOUT WAS AS WHAT WAS BORING AND I JUST FELICE I'VE LOST MYSELF I USED TO PRIDE MYSELF ON THE CRAZY ADVENTURERS AND PROBLEMS THAT WE GET MYSELF IN AND I WAS A GREAT STORY TELLER AND TOT ALL THE SUDDEN DISAPPEARED AS SOON AS HE CAME INTO THE WORLD BECAUSE HE BECAME MY WORLD SO THEN I SAIRD A THING LIKE HINEE TO PULL BACK SOME COOLNESS IN IF I EVER HAD IT THE FIRST PLACE BUT I NEED TO BE A COOLER PERSON THAT I'M COMING ACROSS RIGHT NOW SO I DECIDED I WOIN LEARN TO PLAY DRUMS I'M AN I WOUNG O BE LIKE A US ONE HIT WONDER AS AS A ROCKSTAR DRUMMER I ONLY WANT ONE SONG CAUSE I KNOW I'M NOT TINE ABLE TO DO MORE THAN THAT I'M NOT CORDINATED AT ALL YOU KNOW LIKE FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME IN FITZGRAY TO HAVE THIS REALLY VIVID LIKE FLASHABLD MEMORY OF PLAYING BASKBALL FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME I LOST MY FOOTING I KNOCKED INTO MY OWN TEAMATE PUSHE HEROUT ABOUNDS WHAT SHE HAD THE BALL WE LOST THE GAME AND I WAS NOT INVITED BACK ON THE TEAM FOR THE NEXT SEASON AND SO THAT YOU KNOW FORMENTED MYSELF DEFINITION OF UNCORDINATED I AM A MUSICIAN BUT I'M NOT A DRUMMER AND THE IDEA OF CORDINATING FOR LIMBS IN REAL TIME WAS LIKE IF I COULD DO THAT BE SO PROUD SO THAT'S A GOAL THAT I SET FOR MYSELF AT THE SAME TIME THAT MY SUN CAME INTO THIS WORLD WHEN I WIS ALSO TRYING TO THINK ABOUT GOAL SETTING AND HOW TO IMPROVE MY BILITY AND OUT ALL OF OUR ABILITY TO TO GET A JOB DONE WHEN YOUR FACE WITH SOME PRETTY BIG OBSTACLES SO I GOT TO PRACTICE ALL THESE TECHNIQUES THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT ON MYSELF AND SEE FOR MYSELF WHEN I TELL PEOPLE HEY TRY THIS THING LIKE NARROW FOLCES OF ATTENTION DOES THAT HELP WITH SOMETHING LIKE BECOMING A BETTER DRUMMER AND THE ANSWER IS YA YOU TACTICS AT LEAST WORK FOR ME SOMETIMES UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE DOW FOR OTHER PEOPLE WHO TRY THEM FOR OTHER GOLDS THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY ABOUT EXERCISE IM MEAN A ONE THAT I FOUND PARTICULARLY HELPFUL WAS OVERCOMING MY BAD MEMORY THAT EVERYBODY'S MEMORIES ARE FAULTY MAY EVERYBODY HAS SERT OF A A WARPED PERCEPTION OF THE PAST IT MIGHT BE SCEWED MORE POSITIVELY THAN MAYBE WE DESERVE OR MIGHT YOUSCEEN MORE NEGATIVELY IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU KNOW WHAT LOOMS LARGE AND YOUR MIND AS YOU REFLECT ON SOMETHING FROM THE PAST OR MSTAKES THAT YOU'VE MADE OF THE THINGS THAT THE SOCIALFUL PAUS THAT YOU HAD OR YOU KNOW CHALLENGES THAT YOU FACED AT WORK WHEN GOT IN TROUBLE WITH A BOSS OR WITH A COLLEAGUE THAT'S WHAT REALLY STANDS OUT IN YOUR MIND OR THE GOOD SIDE OF ALL OF THOSE POSSIBILITIES WE PROBABLY AREN'T GETTING THE WORLD RIGKE AND AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT OUR BRAIN HAS VAULF TO GIVE US A FAULTY MEMORY TO LEVEL AND SHARPEN TO NOT IN COD AND REMEMBER AND BE ABLE TO RECALL EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED WITH ACCURACY AND PRECISION AND THAT'S A PROBLEM WHEN IT COMES TO ASSESSING OUR OWN GOLD PROGRESS WHEN WE W ANT TO BE OUR OWN A COUNTANT AND TRY TO DETERMINE HOW ARE WE DOING IF I WANT TO BECOME A DRUMMER AM I ON TRACK FOR GETTING THERE BEFOR EXS BEFORE MY TIME RUNS OUT AN MI GET TO MAKE IT OR NOT AND I THINK THAT'S IN EXPERIENCE WHETHER THEY WON TO BE A DRUMMER OR NOT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN RESINATE WIT LIKE TRYING TO DETERMINE IS THIS TROJECTORY IS HIS RATE OF PROGRESS GOING TO GET THE JOB DONE BY AXIM ON A TIME WHILE I HAVE MY SWIM SUIT BODY BY SUMMER OR WHELE I SAVE ENOUGH FOR RETIREMENT BY THE TIME I HIT SIXTY FIVE FOR THESE GOALS WERE TIME IS INVOLVED AND THERE IS A DEAD LINE AH WE DO TAKE MOMENTS TO ASSESS OUR OR TRAJECTORY AND IF WE JUST RELY ON OUR MEMORY WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO DO A BAD JOB OF ASSESSING THAT THEM THAT TRAJECTORY OF KNOWING WHETHER WOR ON PEACE TO MEETING ARE DEADLINE AND I FOUND THAT TO BE THE CASES I WAS THINKING ABOUT MI ACTUALLY CANG BE ABLE TO LEARN THIS SONG I MEAN I KNOW THAT IT'S GOING A LOT SLOWER THAN A PROBABLY WOOD FOR ANYBODY ELSE BUT TO GIVE MYSELF A DEAD LINE AND A COMMIMEN I DECIDED AS GOINGTO PUT ON A SHOW IWAS GAN INVITE EVERYBODY I KNEW AND ALSO PEOPLE I DIDN'T KNOW ND I'S GOINGTO PLAY MY ONE SONG FOR THEM A THO'S WALL READING YOU BOOK YES OT A JO YE SO WHEND YOU READ THE BOOK YOU'LL YOU'LL SEE MY MY STORY AND IT'S THE REAL TRUTH OF IT YOU KNOW A I MAN I DID PLAY THAT SHOW AND IT WAS FINE A AND THEN I'VE A BECAUSE I WOTE ABOUT IT IN THE BOOK THAN SOME OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO PLAY IT PUBLICLY HAVE COME UP AND IT'S LIKE I RIGHT I TOLD PEOPLE I CAN PLAY DRUMS LIKE BETTERS YOU LIKE SHOW THEM THAT I ACTUALLY STILK CAN PLAY THIS SONG A YES SO THAT THAT'S BEEN FINE I HAVE BECOME A ONE HIT WONDER IF YOU ASKED ME TO PLAY THE SONG AGAIN LIKE LIKE UNCORE IT'S JUST GOIN TO GET THAT SAME SONG A SECOND TIME THOU LIKE LITERALLY WON IT WONDER BUT SO IN THE PROCESSESS LIKE FIGURING OUT AND MI COAN BE ABLE TO PLAY THIS SHOW I SENT OUT INVITATIONS LIKE THE DATE IS COMMITTED LIKE PEOPLE ARE COMING TO LISTEN TO MY ONE SONG GOD BLESS THEM A IT HOW'S I GIN A GO AND AND IT FELT AWFUL IT JUST FELT LIKE I AM NOT MAKING PROGRESS HERE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT MORE THINGS THAT ACTUALLY ARE PRESSING RIGHT LIKE THE KID DOES NEED TO GET FED I DO HAVE TO GO TO MY DAY JOB THE EDITOR IS ASKING FOR THE NEXT DRAFTED THIS BOOK AND THAT IS GOING TO TAKE PRECEDENCE LIKE IT DOES FOR SO MANY PEOPLE THAT THAT THINGS COMMAND YOUR YOU'R BAND WITH EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE THIS GOAL THAT YOU'VE COMMITTED TO AND THAT YOU'VE GOT YOU KNOW ON THE BOOKS AND SO I JUST FELT THIS LOOMING ANXIETY ABOUT THIS THIS GOAL THAT WOULD REQUIRE YOU KNOW LIKE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE DAILYU PRACTISE BUT LIKE YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T CRAM THAT KIND OF A A GOAL IT DOES TAKE YOU KNOW COMMITTED INVESTMENT FOR A SUSTAINED PERIOD OF TIME SO I HAD THIS LOOMING ANXIETY THAT I'M NOT MAKING GOOD ENOUGH PROGRESS BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I WAS RELYING ON MY MEMORY AND MY BRAIN TO TO RECALL LIKE HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU PRACTICE WHAT WAS AT LIKE THE LAST TIME YOU PRACTICE WHAT WAS TAT LIKE WHEN YOU TRIED TO PLAY THIS BIT YOU KNOW THIS RIF LIKE TWO WEEKS AGO HAVE YOU GOT IN ANY BETTER SINCE THEN AND IT JUST FELT LIKE NOW HAVEN'T PRACTISE ENOUGH I DON'T REMEMBER WHEN THE LAST TIME I PLAYED WAS BUT A DEATLY DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IM GETTING ANY BETTER THEN I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT I SHOULD STOP RELING AN MY BRAIN TO TELL ME WHERE AM I AT AND IS IS AND MYI ON AN UPWARD SLOPEIER I NEED TO LOOK AT THE DATA I LOVED DATA SCIENTIST LOVE DATA SO I STARTED O COLICTIT ON MYSELF WHAT I DID WAS DOWN LO THIS AP THAT A FRIEND HAD TOLLD ME ABOUT CALLED THE REPORTER APT OR'S LOTS OF THESE KINDS OF THINGS OUT THERE BASICALLY IT JUST LIKE SETS UP YOUR PHONE O RANDONLY PING YOU WITH WHATEVER QUESTIONS YOU WANT YOUR PHONE TO ASK IT RECORDS YOUR ANSWERS YOU CAN DOWN THO THE DAT I COULD MAKE PRETTY GRAFTS TO SEE AND MY GETTING INOUT WHAT'S MY CHANGE AND HOW I'VE ANSWERED THESE QUEST IONS OVER TIME SO I DID THAT FOR A MONTH FOR A MONTH I HAD MY PHONE ASK ME YOU KNOW COUPLE TIMES A DAY MAYBE TWICE A DAY REALLY DID YOU RACTISE SINCE LAST TIME I ASKED YOU MY PHONE SAYS DID YOU PRACTICSE IF MOSTLY IT WAS KNO AND IF YES THEN IT WOULD FUNNAL A COUPLE OTHER QUESTIONS LIKE HOW DID YOU DO HOW DOYOU FEEL CHECK A COUPLE DIFFERENT EMOTION WORDS NOW ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE O WHEN YOU PLAYED SO WHEN I AND I DID THAT FOR A MONTH AFTER A MONTH WHEN IN IN MY OFFICE DOWN TO O DATA AND FIRST TOOK STOP BEFORE I LOOKED AT THE NUMBER IS LIKE HOW DO I THINK I DID OVER THE LAST MONTH AND I THOUGHT SAME AS EVERY OTHER MONTH I AD LIKE I DIDN'T REALLY GET ANYWHERE YET I PRACTISE THAT I STILL FEEL AWFUL AND I CRIED I CRIED HAVING TO PRACTICSE I I LIKE WAS UPSET WITH MYSELF FOR SETTING THE SCOL AND FEELING LIKE SO ANXIOUS ABOUT ALL I REMEMBER THAT I CRIED CRIED TOO MUCH ABOUT THIS PERSONAL CONQUEST THAT WOULDN'T MATTER TO ANYBODY ELSE HONESTLY REALLY DOESN'T MATTER IN T IN THE SCOPE OF THINGS ANYWAY AND NOT GOIG T BECOME A A DRUMMER PROFESSIONALLY SO WHO CARES IF I EMBARRASS MYSELF PUBLICLY BUT WHAT I FOUND FROM THE DATA WAS MY MEMORY WAS TOTALLY WRONG ACTUALLY HAD PRACTISED FAR MORE TIMES THAN I REMEMBERED AND WHEN I LOOKED AT LIKE MY EMOTION WORDS THAT I USED IT WAS A CLEAR UPWARD TRAJECTORY YA I DID CRY THAT PART I HADN'T MISREMEMBERED AR MADE UP BUT BY THE END OF THAT MONTH LIKE I HAD GOT IN A COMPLIMENT FROM MY HUSBAND WHO ACTUALLY AS A DRUMMER AND SO THEY PAY U THAT WASN'T THAT BAD AND ETHERE WAS LIKE ONE EXCLITIVE YOU WERE ING AMAZING AT THAT ONE THING YOUD BEEN PRACTISING AT BUT LIKE LOOK YO FIND IEUS MY HUSBAND OR IIS YOU' JUST YOU KNOW SO IT THE MOMENT IT DIDN' REALLY FEEL THAT GREA AND I DOWNPLAYED IT N AS RESULTED IN STICK IN MY BRAIN I I REMEMBER HOW STUPID IT FELT THAT I CRIED BECAUSE I CAN'T DO THIS I CAN'T MAKE PROGRESS AND I DOWNPLAYED IN MY MIND THE THING THAT ACTUALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LEGITIMATE INDICATOR THAT PROGRESS WAS BEING MADE SO ALL OF WHICH IS TO SAY I NEEDED TO SEE TO COLLECT THAT DATA ON MYSELF AND TO LOOK AT IT OBJECTIVELY ACCURATELY AND COMPLETELY BECAUSE MY BRAIN WASN'T DOING THAT FOR ME THAT VISUAL EXPERIENCE OF OF DOWNLOADING THAT DATA AND AND LOOKING AT IK WHAT WAS MY ACTUAL EXPERIENCE I GAVE ME BETTER IN SIGHT AS I WAS TRYING TO A SESS THE TRAJECTORY OF MY OF MY PROGRESS I BECAME MORE ACCURATE A COUNTANT OF MY OWN PROGRESS WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU KNOW SETTING GOLD OR RESETTING THEM WHEN YOU NEED TO CALIBRATE IN LIGHT OF OF WHAT'S LEFT TO DO AND HOW MUCH TIME YOU HAVE TO DO IT IN WLL IT SO BESICALLY IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY WHEN THE WHEN THE INTERMEDIATE GOALS OF SA DAILY PRACTTIS RETWIST TO DAY PRACTISE OR READING OUR MATH ET CETERA OR NOT A VISUAL GOAL LINE IT REALLY DOES HELP TO VISUALIZE SOME ASPECT RELATED TO THAT NONVISUAL GOLLINE IN THE SCASE THE REPORTER AP WAS A USEFUL TOOL I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT I PLENTY TO USE IT I'M SURE NUMBER PEOPLE WILL BE INTERESTED IN IT SON LIKE THER OTHERS OUT THERE BUT THAT'S THE ONE THAT YOU FOUND MOST USEFUL YE YET THERE'S ANOTHER ONE TOO IM THAT IS EVEN MORE VISUAL THAN THAT THAN THE REPORTER APPLE THOUGH THAT HAS VISUAL COMPONENTS AND IS REALLY EFFECTIVE IF YOU LIKE DATA IN ONE O COLLECT NUMBERS ON YOURSELF FOR YOUR EXPERIENCE THERE'S ANOTHER ONE CALLED ONE SECOND EVERY DAY AP A THIS IS REALLY AUTEM BECAUSE THE AP ISM MECHANISM IM TO TO TO RECORD ONE SECOND OF YOUR LIFE THE GOALF THERE'S SUCH AN AWESOME COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE THAT JUST LIVE BY THIS AND LOVE HAVING THESE EXPERIENCES A IT AND THE THE CREATOR OF IT I GOT TO A CHANCE TO TALK WITH AND HE HAS DONE THIS HE'S TAKEN ONE SECOND VIDIO OF SOME ASPECT OF HIS LIFE EVERY DAY FOR TWELVE YEARS THIRTEEN YEARS OR ONE SIC YET ONE SECOND AND AND THEN WHAT THE AP DOES IS LL EX SMASH FROM TOGETHER AND GIVE YOU LIKE A CHRONOLOGY OF WHAT YOUR YEAR OR YOUR MONTH ORE YOUR LAST DECADE OF LIFE HAS BEEN LIKE AND PRESENTS IT AS LIKE A STREEM MY NVIDIOPHER YOU SE YOU JU SEE THESE FLASHES AOF YOUR LIFE OVER HOWEVER LONG YOU TELL THE APTA CREATA CREATA MONTAGE FOR YOU AND SO WHEN YOU SEE THESE VIDOS THAT PEOPLE HAVE MADE ESPECIALY THOSE HAV BE DOING IT FAIRLY LONG TIME IT'S FASCINATING I DID THAT FOR MYSELF TOYOU I TRIED AT ONE SECOND OF TO DAY'S DRUMMING PERFORMANCE ANOTHER SECOND 'S NOT ENOUGH TO CAPTURE AND MY ACTUALLY DOING A GOOD JOB OF DRUMMING OR WHATS MY TROJECTORY FOR DRUMMING BUT THE GON WHO MADE IT SAYS ONE OF THE MOST LIKE AWSOM ONE SECOND VIDIOS THAT HE EVER MADE IS OF A BRICK WALL IS LIKE LEAD ANETA VIDIO OF THAT LIKE WHAT'S THE BALL DOING IT OSN'T 'S NOT CRUMBLING IT'S NOT LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE LY UNDER SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT'S JUST LIKE WE KNOW SLIGHTLY JETTERY ONE SECOND OF A BRICK WALL LIKE HOW IS THAT MOTIVATING OR EXSITING TO YOU WHY AS THAT YOU BEEN DOING THIS FOR THIRTEEN YEARS EVERY DAY ONE SECONAND WHY IS THAT THE ONE SECOND THAT MATTERS TO YOU MOST AND HE SAYS BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES UP IN MY MONTAGE IT REMINDS ME A OF LIKE A RALLY HORRIFIC MOMEN IN MY FAMILY THAT WAS THE FIRST WALL THAT I SAW WHEN I WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM HAVING HEARD THAT MY SISTER IN LAW HAD THIS AWFUL AWFUL A EXPERIENCE HER IN TESTAN STARTED A TWIST UP ON THEMSELVES AND NOT UP AND SHE I WAS ON THE BRINK OF DEATH AND WE HAD JUST FOUND THIS OUT SHE HAD JUST GOTTEN INTO THE HOSPITAL THEY DIAGNOS THIS ISSUE THAT REQUIRED LIKE IMMEDIATE SURGERY AND OUR FAMILY WAS THERE TO HEAR ABOUT THIS AND WE'RE ALL STUNNED THAT SHE MIGHT DIE LI COULD RIGHT NOW SHE MIGHT DIE AND THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT I SAW AND IT REMINDS ME OF HOW PRECIOUS LIFE IS HOW IMPORTANT FAMILY IS AND HOW THE REST OF WHATEVER WE WERE DOING THAT DAY DIDN'T MATTER BECAUSE WE ALL NEEDED TO BE HERE TOGETHER RIGHT NOW AND THAT IS LIKE ALL OF THIS EMOTION A AND THE PURPOSE IN LIFE IS CONJURED UP OR REMINDED WHEN HE LOOKS AT WHEN SECOND OF A BRICK WALL AS IT COPS EN TO HIS VEDOFE SO IF YOU'RE VISUALLY OR REENTED AND YOU DO WANT WAYS TILL I REMEMBER WHAT WAS LIFE LIKE BUT AS MA YEAR AND REVIEW WHAT IS IT WHAT IS IT LOOK LIKE ITI'S AN OSSOM AP ONCE THI CAN EVERY DAY THAT THAT CAN HELP YOU DO THAT THESE ARE GREAT RECOMMENDATIONS AND A A COUPLE OF REFLECTIONS FIRST OF ALL A THE BRICK WALL EXAMPLE IS A BEAUTIFUL WAY OF A HIGHLIGHTING THIS OTHER FEATURE OF THE VISUAL SYSTEM WHICH IS THAT THE BRAIN LARGELY THINGS IN SYMBOLS IT'S VERY EFFICIENT IT ITBATCHES ENTIRE EXPERIENCES IN TO SYMBOLS AN THIS CASE THE BRICK WALL CAN BE ATTACHED TO A WHOLE SET OF EXPERIENCES THAT ARE VERY MEANINGFUL TO THIS INDIVIDUAL THAT BRICK WALLS DON'T MEAN THAT OR DIDN'T MEAN THAT A TO ME UNTIL HEARING THIS SO I THINK THAT THE IT HIGHLIGTES THE FACT THAT THE THE ACTUAL SYMBOL IS LESS RELEVANT THAN MWHAT WE ATTACHED TO THAT SYMBOL BUT THAT SYMBOLS ARE SO EFFICIENT THAT EVEN IN ONE SECOND VIEW OF SOMETHING WE CAN ATTACH TO IT FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE A THE OTHER IS THAT I I MA ABSOLUTE A ALMOST RABID PROPONENT OF PEOPLE GETTING MORNING SUNLIGHT IN THEIR EYES AS THE FUNDAMENTAL LAYER OF SETTING THEIR CIRCATING RHYTHMS AND SLEEP AN HEALTH AS A ZERO COST PRACTICE THAT BELIEVE ORE NOT CAN BE DONE ANY TIME OF YEAR ANYWHERE AND BUT IT DOES TO TAKE A LUIBIT OF EFFORT YOU MAY HAVE TO GET OUTSIDE YOU CAN'T DO THROUGH A WINDOW OR WIN SHIEL TO FOR IT TO BE EFFICIEN BUT IT HAS HUGE OUTSIZE EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH THIS IS NOW BEEN DEMONSTRATE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SO A I  GETO JUST DO A SORT OF CALL TO ACTION IF PEOPLE ARE ALREADY DOING THIS I'M GOING TO START USING THE ONE SECOND AFT TO RECORD MY A MORNING SUNLIGHT VIEWING AND PROVE THAT EVEN THROUGH CLOUD COVER YOU'RE GETTING MORE PHOTONS THAN YOU ARE INDOORS AND THEN IT'S WORTH WHILE HELSE WOED LOVE TO DO THIS FOR MY NEXT DOG TO GO FROM PUPPY TO A TO FULL SIZED DOG AND MAY EVEN TO THE END ANDAS AM GREAT THESE ARE WONDERFUL TOOLS AYU'VE GIVEN US A HUGE NUMBER OF OF PRACTICAL TOOLS WHICH FRANKLY ISN'T ALWAYS THE CASE AN ON THESE PYCASTS WE ALWAYS STRIVE TO DO SCINS AND SCIENCE SPASE TOOLS IS ARE KIND OF MONTRO BUT YOU GIVEN A A RICH SET OF TOOLS HERE TO APPLY I JUST WONE OF BRIEFLY BACK TRACK TO SOMETHING AND THEN AND THEN A FINAL QUESTION A EARLIER WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW UNFIT PEOPLE SEE THE WORLD IS MORE CHALLENGE AND MAYBEEN HILLSAS STEEPER DISTANCES AS FURTHER AND HOW A SHIFTING PEOPLE INTO A STATE OF ENERGY EITHER COGNTIVELY OR THROUGH THE INGESTION OF REAL GLUCOS TO GET A ENERGETIC LIFT OR MAY BE THROUGH CAPHINE IF THAT'S WITHIN THEIR PRACTICE AND SPAN OF A HEALTHY BEHAVIORS THEY COULD DO THAT YOU KNOW THERE'RE SO MANY PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION WHICH IT ONE OF THE YOU KNOW KE FEATURES OF DEPRESSION AS A LACK OF ENERGY EVEN THOUGH THER CAN BE ANYANXIETY ASSOCIATE WITH DEPRESSION A I HAVE TO WONDER WHETHER OR NOT SOME OF THESE TOOLS ARE BEING DEPLOYED OR WILL BE DEPLOYED IN THE CONTEXT OF MENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE DEPRESSION IS THIS VICIOUS SLOOP RIGHT PEOPLE FEEL A LACK OF ENERGY AND HOPELESSNESS AND THEN THINGS JUST LOOK HARDER AND SO THAT IT JUST VERIFIES THEIR NEGATIVE WORLD VIEW I ITS A DOWNWARD SPIRAL THAT'S WHY MEDICATION N SOME CASES AND SOCIAL SPORTET THAT OR CAN BE HELPFUL BECAUSE THEY FEEL MORE ENERGIZED THE SIDE EFFECTS OFF INOUR PROBLEM HOWEVER HAVE BEEN HAVE THERE BEEN ANY EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THESE VISUAL TOOLS TO CREATE THIS INCREASE OF SOSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE IN ACCOUNT OF READINESS AN WILLINGNESS TO LEANG INTO WHAT PEOPLE PERCEIVE AS EVENTS CHALLENGE AND IF NOT FOR ANY ONE LISTENING I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF LISTENERS IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SPASEAND IN THE HELPING SPACE SO TO SPEAK I CAN IMAGINE THESE ARE ZOURO COST MI THEY WE ALL PROVIDE PEOPLE ARE SITED I HAVE THE APPARAPI TO DO IT ARE YOU WERE OF ANY STUDIES LIKE THISTERS YOUR LABORATORY VOLVED IN THESE STUDYESE OLODIES JO SEE IN IMIMMENSE VALUE OF IMIMPLEMENTING THE SORTS OF TOOLS THAT YOU'VE DEVELOPED YE YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T EXPLORED THAT THOSE IDEAS DIRECTLY SO CALL TO ALL THE SCIENTISTS THAT AUR OUT THERES IS THERE'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO START LOOKING AT THESE TOOLS WITHIN THE MENTAL HEALTH SPACE YOU'RE RIGHT OTHER RESEARCHERS THOUGH HAVE A YOU KNOW NOT THIS USE OF NARROWED LIKE INDUCING A NARROWEDATENTIONAL FOCUS AND CAN THEY NOW FEEL MORE ENERGIS TO GO FOR A RUN BUT THEY HAVE LOOKED AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANXIETY DEPRESSION AN VISUAL EXPERIENCE INFOUND YOU KNOW OVER DECADES M EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION OR WITH ANXIETY WHAT THEIR ATTENTION IS CAPTURED BY WITHIN THE BIGGER GLOBAL SURROUNDING WORLD ARE THOSE THINGS THAT ARE NEGATIVE OR REINFORCING OF THEIR WORLD VIEW NOW THAT HAPPENS FOR EVERYBODY THAT THINGS THAT ARE ON OUR MIND TEN TO TIT POP OUT THAT IF WHATEVER WERE THINKING ABOUT WE MIGHT START SEEING IT'S SOME VERSION OF IT SHOWING UP IN THE WORLD AROUND US THAT CAPTURES OUR ATTENTION THAT'S AN IDEA CALLED PRIMING WHAT WERE THINKING ABOUT MIGHT THEN LEAD US TO TO TO ATTEND TO THE WORLD TO SEE THINGS IN A WAY THAT A LINES OS WHAT WE E LREADY THINKING ABOUT IT'S JUST THAT WHEN WHAT WERE THINKING ABOUT ARE THOSE DEPRESSIVE RUMINATIVE ANXIETY FEARFUL A THOUGHTS WHEN THAT IS WHAT IS COGNITIVELY ACCESSIBLE WHEN THAT'S WHAT'S GOING THROUGH OUR MIND THEN THAT'S ALSO WHAT CAPTURES OUR VISUAL GAZE SO WHEN WE THINK THEY THE WORLD IS HARD THE WORLD IS FULL OF SADNESS AND NOT'S THE THOUGHT IN OUR MIND AND THEN WE START SEEING THE PEOPLE WITH FROUNDS ON THEIR FACES OR WHOARE EXPERIENCING ANXIETY AND AND THAT'S WHAT CAPTURES ARE ATTENTION EVEN WHEN THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THAT MIGHT NOT BE SEEING THE WORLD OR EXPERIENCING THE WORLD THAT WAY IT BECOMES REINFORCING WHEN I THINK THAT THE WORLD IS IS THREATENING AND THEN I NOTICE THE THREATS THAT ARE AROUND ME CONFIRMS WHAT I'M THINKING WHICH HEIGHTENS MY ANXIETY OR MY FEAR AND THEN AT FURTHER LEADS ME TO TO NARROWLY FOCUS ON THOSE ELEMENTS OF THE ENVIRONMENT THAT ARE ALINED WITH THAT WORLD VIEW IT'S REALLY HARD TO GET OUT OF THAT LIKE THAT'S WHERE THE VICIOUS PSYCHAL CAN COME FROM SO THAT HAS BEEN IN A REALLY WELL ESTABLISHED WITHIN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY THIS THIS SELECTIVE ATTENTION RELATING TO HAVE STATES OF MENTAL UNWELLNESS AN THAT'S THAT'S BEEN PRETTY WELL ESTABLISHED AND AM AND SO THERE'S BEEN SOME INTERVENTIONS DONE WITH PEOPLE THAT HAVE DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY TRYING YOU KNOWS SAMELY NOW HERE'S A AN ARRAY A PHOTOGRAPH OF BUNCH OF DIFFERENT FACES YES THAT'S ARTIFICIAL KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A PAGE FROM A YEAR BOOK A HIGH SCHOOL YEAR BOOK BUT LOOK FOR THE FACES THAT ARE SMILING LOOK AT THE FACES THAT ARE SMILING TRY RIGHT NOW SPEND TEN MINUTES HAVING YOUR EYES FOCUS ON THOSE AN AND LOOK AT THOSE PEOPLE THA IT IS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENGIN A TRY AT IMPROVING  PEOPLE SENSE OF SELF EFFICACY OF WHAT CAN HAVE ACCOMPLISHED NEXT THEY FEEL A LITLE BIT MORE ENERGIZED IT DOESN'T CURE DEPRESSION IT DOESN'T CURE ANXIETY NDTHESE ARE LITERALS PHYSICAL I AFFLICTIONS THAT WE HAVE SO THAT'S NT A QUICK FIX BUT IT CAN PRODUCE THA TEMPORARY CHANGE THAT MIGHT BE AWAY TO START GETTING OUT OF THAT RAT YEN I THINK NOWADAYS THERE'S IN INCREASING ATTENTION ON TOOLS THAT WILL HELP PEOPLE ORIENT AS THEY ARE START TO VERE TOWARDS SUICIDEAL DEPRESSION OR VERE BACK INTO A DEPRESSIVE EPISODE OR ANXIETY EPISODE OF EN ET A THE TRYING TO REVERSE AN ENTIRE SINDRUM OR SET OF SENDRUMS IS FAR MORE COMPLICATED LIKEWISE IN THE HEALTH SPACE JUST TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO DEPLOY REAL TIME TOOLS TO A JUST OR ANXIETY OR TO EXERCISE MORE OFTEN AM AND SO ON AS AT KIND OF A FINAL BUT ALSO ON A HIGHLOVEL QUESTION I'M IMAGINING THAT AN I I'V PLAND TO USE THIS VISUAL GOLL SETTING OF SPOTLIGHTING I'VE BEEN USING AN ACTULLY FOR SOME TIME ON RUNS IT WORKS TRALLY WELL YESTERDI TOOK A RUN NEAR THE WATER FRONT HERE AND AND THE ENTIRE THEN I DID IT SOMEWHAT INCORRECTLY THE ENTIRE RUN OFSING BY GETTING BACK TO THE STATUE AT WHICH I STARTED BUT I DID FIND THAT I RAN FASTEST IN THE FINAL TWENTY METERS WR ADMITTEDLY WASN'T FAST AT ALL BUT IS FASTER THAN WHAT PRECEDED IT AM SO IT WORKS AND IT MAKES PERFECT SENSES TO HOW IT WORKS YOU'VE DONE OTHER STUDIES A EXPLORING SOME OF THE OTHER FEATURES OF VISION LIKE THE LUMINOSITY HOW BRIGHT SOMETHING IS AND HOW PEOPLE PRECEEVE THAT THAT WAS AN INCOMPLETELY DIFFERENT CONTACT BUT IS THERE A KIND OF A HIGHER LEVEL A COUND OF A BLACK BELT VERSION OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WHERE NOT ONLY MY FOCASSING ON A SPECIFIC VISUAL LOCATION AS AN INTHER INTERMEDIATE OR A LONG TERMED GOAL ER I'M USING AN APT TO ASK ME A QUESTION AND TAPPEN TO HOW I'M FEELING CREATE A VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF MY MODIVATIONAL STATE BUT THAT I'M ALSO MAKING MY PHONE AS BRIGHT AS POSSIBLE I'M ALSO TRYING TO TAKE THAT VISUAL WINDOW AND AN ACTUALLY PAY ATTENTION TO MORE OF THE DETAILS AT THAT LOCATION ORS IT SIMPLY A MATTER OF CIND OF A IN IN GEEK SPEAK VISUAL NORROW SCIENCE WE WOULD JUST CALL THIS LIKE LOW SPACIAL FREQUENCY JUS ORT OF GRABBING A BLACK AND WHITE SNOP SHOT OF SOMETHING HERE R THERE IN MY MIND IF I ATTACH MORE DETAIL AND EFFORT TO THE SPECIFIC THING THAT I'M FOCASED ON ISTHERE ANY EVIDENCE THATS MORE EFFECTIVE  IT CERTAINLY OU NOR CHANGES WHAT A BRAINS ARE DOING SO OU KNOW HOW DO WE DEFINE EFFECTIVENESS THAT'S A QUESTION FOR PHILOSOPHERS AND THAT SCIENTISTS WILL I EAVMING RUNING YEIT WILL WHEN YOU USE IT THROUG THA UNDER YOUR RUN DUST LIKE NEW PICKED UP ON A YES SO YOU KNOW THERE'S ATHERE'S COOL STUDIES THAT NARROW SCIENTIS NOT NOT I NOT MING FROM MY LAB THAT NEROW SCIENTISTS HAVE DONE LOOKING AT DUT WHAT IS IT WHAT IS IT DOING TO YOUR BRAIN WHEN YOU'VE DECIDED THAT YOU ARE GIN A FOCUSS YOUR ATTENTION ON ON THIS ELEMENT OF THE WORLD AND NOT PAY ATTENTION TO SOMETHING ELSE IS THAT JUST SORT OF LIKE TRICKING YOUR THOUGHTS OR IS IT DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO SOMETHING MORE BASIC MORE LOW LEVEL AND THE UNSER IS YES SO THERE IS AN AREA OF THE PRAIN BRAIN THE FUSIVE FORM FACE AREATS PART OF OUR BRAIN THAT'S REALLY SPECIALIZED FOR FOR MAKING SENSE OF FACES IMPORTANT AS A SOCIAL SPECIES TO TO PAY ATTENTION TO OTHER PEOPLE PAY ATTENTION TAR FACES WITH A TRANTIC COMMUNICATESTHROUGH THEIR FACE SO OUR BRAIN HAS DEVELOPED A REALLY SPECIALIZED A CENTRAL AREA FOR DOING THAT THEN AND SO PEOPSO THESE NARROW SCIENTIST WILL PRESENT LIKE A FACE TO SOMEBODY BUT SUPERIMPOSED OVER THAT AIS A HOUSE OR SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS LESS SPECIAL

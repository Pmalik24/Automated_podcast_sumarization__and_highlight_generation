JOBIDON VISITS VEATNOM WHERE HE ASSURES THE WORLD HE HAS NO INTEREST IN CONTAINING THE CHINESE THE GEESLEN Y REFUSES TO CONTNEM RUSSH OVER ITS INVASION OF YOU CRAN AND HO MEX GOES GOVERNOR SAYS TO HELL WITH THE SECOND MEMET I'M BENTSUUR OF THE SISVENTPURO SHOW THE BENSHKIR SHO RESPONSER BY EXPRESSVE PIAN PROTECT YOUR AMINE PRIVACY TODAYE EXPRESS VEPIANDA COM SLESHMEN IT'S VERY EASY TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THE HORSE RACE AND BECAUSE AGAN WE ARE IN A PRESIDENTIAL PREE YEAR THE PRESIDENTIAL YEAR USED TO START IN LIKE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR BUT NOW STRETCHES THE FULL YEAR BEFOREHAND ITS ONLY SEPTEMBER OF THE PRIOR YEAR AND WE ARE ALREADY IN FULL HORSE RACE MODE BUT IT'S EASY TO FORGET THAT THE PRESIDENCY ACTUALLY MATTERS IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ALL OF THE LIGHTS AND THE WHISTLES IT'S ALSO ABOUT CAN YOU BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND DO A GOOD JOB AND JOBIDN CONTINUES TO PROVE THAT HE IS NOT CAPABLE OF THIS SO OVER THE WEEKEN JOBIDN WEN TO HANOI VEANOM HIS STRATEGY IN VEATNOM WAS TO APPARENTLY ATTEMPT TO CREATE SOME SORT OF DIVISION BETWEEN VEITNOM IN CHINA IT'S ESSENTIALLY AT CONTAINMENT STRATEGY AND THIS A STRATEGY THAT HAS BEEN PURSUED HIM BY PARSAN FASHION BY EVERY PRESIDENT FOR THE LAST TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS THE BASIC IDEA IS YOU GET JAPAN AND SOUT COREA AND VEATNOM AND ALL THE COUNTRIES THAT SURROUND CHINA TO BASICALLY CREATE A COUNTERWEIGHT TO CHINA AND BOX THEM IN SUCH THAT AMERICA HAS ALLIES SURROUNDING CHINA IN PRETTY MUCH EVERY DIRECTION THAT THAT LEAST IS THE STRATEGY AND THAT REQUIRES SOME DELICATE DIPLOMACY BECAUSE THE FACT IS THAT CHINA IS A VERY AGGRESSIVE COUNTRY AND UNDER GESIAN PANG AND INCREASINGLY AGGRESSIVE COUNTRY IT OULD ALSO REQUIRE THAT THE CHINESE YOU KNOW HAVE A LITTLEBIT OF FEAR THAT THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO STAND BY HIS WARD THAT THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT IS ACTUALLY SOMEBODY WEAS GOING TO STAND UP FOR A PARTICULAR LIN HAT F A LINE IS DRAWN AND THAT LINE IS CROSS THAT THE AMERICANS ARE SHIGAN N DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT WELL THAT IS RATHER UNDERCUT WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS FEEBLE AND THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THIS JOBIDENS FEEBLE SO HIS ENTIRE TEAM PUT OUT A SCHEDUAL OF HIS EVENTS YESTERDAY TO DAY HE APPARENTLY WAS GOING TO BE IN VEATNOM YESTERDAY AND OVER THE WEEK EN HE FLEW THERE AND HE HATA BEVY OF EVENTS HAD GOT IO PLANE AND HE HADED TO ALASKA FOR THE SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH MEMORIAL EVENT ANOWISAN ALASKA FOR FOR THE SEPTEMBER ELEVEN MEMORIALMEN DOES MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME LAST I CHECKED I MEAN I WAS THERE FOR SEPTEMBER ELEVENTHAN AND SO ARE YOU IZHIM AND UM YOU RECALL THAT IT HAD LITERALLY NOTHING TO DO WITH LASKA BUT SOME FOR SOME REASON JOBIDNES CONMEALASKA FOR SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH BECAUSE WHY THE HELMOT AND UM AND THIS WAS PROOF OF HIS VERALITY THIS IS PROOF THAT HE WAS HE WAS SOMEBODY WHO'S DURABLE AND HE WAS GOING TO BE SOMEBODY WHO CAN STAND UP TO THE RIGERS OF THE JOBBLER'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM BY THE TIME HE HAD BEANOM DUBSSLYP AND HE JUSTSTATISLEP THE ENTIRE TRIB SO FOR EXAMPLE JOBIDON STAFF HAD TO CUT HIM OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE HE IS HE STARTED WANDERING ON THE STAGE NO ONE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING HERE WE TOABOOBOVEROABO OOBOMECUETUR SO NNTER AV ACCESS TOTIN AV ACE WEW WASN'T PERFENTATES OR ALL NO   EVERYBODY ETTEVERYON ON Y UP TINKLY PIANO PLAY HIM OFF IS IT'S IT'S THE TONIES NOW HE'S GETTING A WAR THIS 'M SORRY YOUR TIME IS UP MISTER PRESIDENT DO DO DO JUST GET THE TINCAIS GAT KENNAGY IN THE CORNER WITH THE SASXIPO JOBIDON ALSO SAID IN THEMIDDLE OF THIS PRESS CONFERENCE THAT HE WAS GOING TO BED WHICH HIS ALWAYS A GREAT INDICATOR OF JUST THE THE ABSOLUTE VITALITY OF THE PRESIDENCY HERE HERE WAS JOBI AN EXPLAINING THAT HE IS GOING TO SLEEP I DON'T THE ANYWAY I JUST THINK THAT THER OTHER THINGS OR LEADERS WORS AN THE RESPOND O WHAT TETHE TERN L NOBODY LIKE IVY SOUBRATED YOUAPER MES I YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WORE A THE ME IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GAIN HE MAY HAVE A GA YE JUST HASCURO ME UT I TA WAN ON ABO YOU I'M GOING TO GOING TO TET I WHAT A VE VERY ENCOURAGING STUFF THERE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WO APPARENTLY IS CAPABLE OF ALLOWING A SOUND TO EMERGE FROM HIS MOUTH ONLY ONCE EVERY FIVE OR SIX SECONDS BEFORE HE HAS TO TELL PEOPLE THAT HE IS READY FOR HIS BEDY BUY HIS WARM CUP OF MILL AND A BIG BIG HUG FROM HIS NIGHT NURSE PRESUMABLY HIS PRES SECRETARY THAT THAT IS THAT IS INSANE STUFF BUT HERE IS THE PROBLEM FOR JOBIDON HE'S BAD AT THE JOB IT'S NOT JUST THAT HE IS PHYSICALLY FEEBLE WHICH HE IS OR THAT HE IS MENTALLY FEEBLE WHICH HE HAS KIND OF ALWAYS BEEN IN HE IS JUST MORE SO NOW THE PROBLEM WITH JOBIDONES THAT HIS POLICIES OUR GARBAGE AND WE HAVE A GRESSIVE ENEMIES SO TO DAY IS IN FACT SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH THERE ARE MANY LESSONS WE SHOULD HAVE LEARNED ON SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH AND THAT WE'VE BUSILY SPENT LAST TWENTY YEARS ALL MORNING ONE OF THOSE BIG LESSONS IS FOREIN POLICY ACTUALLY MATTERS HAT ACTUALLY HAS CONSEQUENCES AND THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A LITTLE BUT OF FORESIGHT THE CONSEQUENCES CAN BE DISASTROUS NOW YOU FORESIGHT WE DID NOT HAVE IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES IS THAT IF WE DID NOT STOP AL KITA IN ITS TRACTS IN NINETEO NINETY IGT WHEN THEY BOMBED THE EMBASSIES IN TENTINEA AND CENYA THAT THAT WOULD COME BACK TO HAUNT AMERICIZE ALL KITA GREW AT MATASTISIZE AND WOULD END WITH THEDEATH OF THREE THAUSAN AMERICANS ON NINE ELEVEN C  WHAT WE'RE TONG MOUTRIGHT NOW ONAN OR IT IS IS ORS O MAGNATUDE LARGER IF YOU DON'T STOP THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IN ITS TRACTS WHEN IT COMES TO ITS A GRESSIVE INSTINCTS WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT NO THREE THOUSAND AMERICANS THAT WHICH WAS THE WORST TRAGEDY ON AMERICAN SOIL SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE A FULL SCALE CONFLAGRATION WHITH THE LARGEST PHYSICAL ARMY ON PLAN AT EARTH AMERICA HAS THE BEST ARMAN PLANE EARTH MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY VENCED OUR MAM PLAN EARTH BUT IF YOU DON'T STOP THE CHIN ES PEOPLE BUMBLE THEIR WAIGHT INTO WAR BECAUSE OF MIS INTERPRETATION THEY THINK THE OTHER SIDE IS WEAKER THAN IT IS MOST WARS IN THE MODERN EARA GET STARTED EXACTLY THE WAY THE WAR BUT TWEEN RUSSIAN YOU CRANE GOT STARTED RUSSIA MISINTERPRETED SIGNALS FROM THE WEST THAT THEY WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING IF YOUR CRANE WAS INVADED AND THE MIS INTERPRETED OU CRANES MILITARY STRENGTH AND THEN THEY INVADED AND NOW WE ARE NOW IN IN YEAR TWO OF A LONG WAR THAT IS KILLED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THOSE SORTS OF MIS INTERPRETATIONS R R CREATED BY FAILURS OF COMMUNICATION AND JO BIDON CANNOT COMMUNICATE HE IS NOT CAPABLE OF THIS AND MEANWHILE GISIAN PANG IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE AGGRESSIVE IS ENTIRE STRATITUE WITH REGARD TO CHINA IS QUITE FRIGHTENING NOT BECAUSE IT'S BOUND TO BE SUCCESSFUL AN MAKE CHINA STRONGER BUT BECAUSE IT IS BOUND TO MAKE CHINA ACTUALLY WEAKER AND THUS MORE AGGRESSIVE I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE CHINA HAS MASSIVE PROBINS WE DIDN A OU TO VIDOUS SYOU CHECK OUT IN OUR SERIOUS FACT RIT TALK ABOUT THE BIG PRIBMS THE CHINA HAS BUT THEY INCLUDE THINGS LIKE DEMOGRAPHIC CHINA IS COMPLETELY DEMOGRAPHICALLY UPSIDE DOWN THEY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH YOUNG PEOPLE TAS HOU PROVIDE THE LABOR FORCE OR THE EARNING FORCE TO PAY FOR ALL OF THE DEBT THEY'VE TAKEN OUT SPEAKIN OF WHICH THEIR DEBT IS EXTRAORDINARY IF YO USHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE PUBLICAN PRIVATE DEBT THAT DAVE IN CURRED THE'S NO SUCH THING AS A REAL PRIVATE SECTOR EVERYTING IS BACK BY THE GOVERNMENT OVER THERE YOUR TALK ABOUT A COUNTRY THAT IS UP TO ITS EYEBALLS IN DAT AND YOUARE TALKN ABOUT A COUNTRY THAT IS NOW CUT OFF THE ONLY MECHANISM FOR ECONOMIC SUCCESS THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO IT IN CAPITALISM SO LEAST

POWERFUL LEADERS GATHERED IN NEW DELLY FOR THIS YEARS PROMERE DIPLOMATIC EVENT THE Y TWENTY SUMMIT BUT CHINA'S SESHIAN PING DEEM DID NOT WORTH HIS TIME HIS ABSENCE SENTS A STARK SIGNAL CHINA IS DONE WITH THE ESTABLISHED WORLD ORDER TICHING THE SUMMIT MARKED TO DRAMATIC TURN IN CHINAS FORM POLICY FOR HE PASS SEVERAL YEARS SHE HAS APPARENTLY SOUTZ MAKE CHINA AND ALTERNATIVE TO THE WEST NOW SHE IS POSITIONIG HIS COUNTRY IS A FULL ON OPPONENT READY TO A LINE IT'S OWN BLOCK AGAINST THE UNITED STATES ITS PARTNERS AND INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS THEY SUPPORT SHE'S BREAK WIAT THE ESTABLISHMENT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING HEIS PREDECESSORS INTEGRATED CHINA INTO THE US LED GLOBEL ORDER BY JOINING ITS FOUNDATIONAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE WORLD BANK AND THE U T O FOR MUCH OF HIS TENAR OVER THE PAST ECADE SHE HAS KEPT A FOOT IN THE DOOR TO THE WESTERN ORDER EVEN AS CHINA'S RELATIONS WITH THE US HAVE THE TERIORATED CHINA EVEN PARTICIPATED THOUGH GRUDGINGLY IN G TWENTY EFFORTS TELP ALLEVIATE DET BURDENS ON STRUGGLING LOW IN COME COUNTRIES BUT OVER THE COURSE OF HIS RULE SHE HIS NOW GROWN HOSTILE TO THE EXISTING ORDER HE'S INTENT ON ALTERING IT HE'S FOKIS ON DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVE INSTITUTIONS BASIAN COULD LEAD IN CONTROL HES FORM THE ISION IN FOR STRUCTIRON VESTMEN BANK TS RIVAL THE WORLD BANK HE'S PROMOTED COMPETING INTERNATIONAL FORMS LIKE THE SHANGHI COOPERATION ORGANIZATION WHOS MEMBERSHIP INCLUDES RUSSIA AND AR ON HE'S GEN A STICK AROUND AT THE UEN BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY HE THINKS HE CAN MILITORIZE IT BUT THE G TWENTY IS NOT ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE HE IS ACTUALLY FLUXING HIS INFLUENCE BECAUSE HEULD LIKE TO UNDERCUT THE G TWENTY THE MAP CONTROVERSY SUGGESTSD G'SN SH'S AT NATIONALIST PURSUIT OF GLOBAL POWER COULD UNDER MINE AS PUSHD TO LEAD A NEW BLOCK AGAINST THE WAST BECAUSE H IS TAKING OFF BY THE WAY THE INDIANS FOR EXAMPLE BUT HE SEES THE UNITED STATES AS HIS CHIEF GLOBAL OPPONENT THIS S BEING HIGH LIT OVER THE WEEKEN BY THE FACT THAT CHINA WENT ON HIGH ALERT AFTER JUSTIN CANADIAN SHIPS WENT THROUGH THE TIME ON STRAIHT ACCORDING TO THE ASIONAS FROSS PRESS CHINA SET ON SATURDAY THAT ITS STRIPS WERE UN CONSTAN HIGH ALERT AFTER TWO SHIPS BELONGING TO T USSIN CANADA CRANSITED THROUGH THE TIME ON STRAIGHT ACCORDING TO A MILITARY SPOKES PERSON THIS BY THE WAY IS ONE REASON WHY THE UNITED STATES CUTING BACK ITS MILITARY ABOUTCH AT PARTICULAR AND THE NAVY IS IDIOTIC IN THE EXTREME IT IS TRUE THE UNITED STATES HAS THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL NAVY BY LONGSHIT IT IS ALLSO TRUE THAT THE UNITED STATES REQUIRES THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL NAVY BECAUSE MANY OF THE SHIPPING LANES THAT ARE EASY CHOKE POINTS FOR OUR ENEMIES OUR VERY VERY FAR AWAY FROM US CHINA OISN'T REQUIRE A DEEP WATER NAVY IN ORDER CHALLEGE THE UNITED STATES ALL THEY REQUIRE IS WHAT HEY ALL A GRAY WATER NAVY IN ORDER TO INSURE THAT THACAN BASICALLY CONTROL THE TIWON STRAIGHT THE TIME ON STRIGHT IS RIGHT THEIR BACK YARD IT IS NOT IN OUR BACK YARD OBVIOUSLY IT SO THIS IS IS A PROBLEM FOR US SO YOU'D IMAGINE THAT STRONG AMERICAN LEADERSHIP WOULD BE  SOMETHING WORTH WHILE WHELL MEANWHILE JOBIDON HE'S OUT THEIR SAYINGTHINGS LIKE I DON'T WANT O CONTAINE CHINA I DN'T WANT TO CONTAIN WHAT WHY NOT I SERIOUSLY WHY NOT WHY WOULD YOU NOT WANT TO CONTAIN CHINA I UNDERSTAND THAT WERE SORT OF PUSSY FOOTIG AROUND THIS HOLLISSIA WITH CHINA BUT THE REALITY IS THE G IS NOT AND TAKING A MORE AGGRESSIVE POSTURE TOWARD CHINA SANGLASON THE WAY THAT YOUR REGHIME IS CURRENTLY IT IS CURRENTLY ATTACKING THE REST OF THE WORLD WITH IT SOFT POWER AND SOMETIMES WITH HARD POWER E'S NOT ACCEPTABLE TO THE UNITED STATES ENNG TO BUILD UP OUR MILITARY AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW YOUE TO USE YOUR EXPANSIONISM TO THREATEN AMERICAN INTEREST WHICH DO INCLUDE PLACES LIKE TIWAN HERE JOTAN OUT WOOD WOULDS REID ABOUT BIDNS THAT HE'S HE SICKNEIS COMPL LY CON FUSED APPROACH SO FROM TIME TO TIME HE WILL SAY THINGS LIKE IF TIME WANT IS ATTACKE A MERICABILE DEFEND WHICH AS I'VE SAID BEFORE IS ATTUALLY NOT A TERRIBLE THING TO SAY IVINGS HASSHE THE RIGHT THING TO SAY BUT IT WULD REQUIRE AN ACTUAL DEDICATION TO A MILITARY BUDCHIT  CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING  THAT KIND OF BRASH TALK BIDON'S TALK ON FOREIGN POLICY IS GENERALLY EMPTY WORDS FOLLOWED BY VERY LITTLE ELSE AND THIS CREETS VERY STICKY SITUATIONS AS WE'LL EE WHEN IT COMES T OU CRANE THE SECOND HERE IS JOBIDONSHING HE OESN'T WANT TO CONTAIN CHINA GETS O I MEAN ALL OF THAT HEE DOES ONE TO CONTAIN CHINA THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE THINKS HE MEANS BY THAT I REALLY NON'T SO HE WAS INVYANOM SPECIFICALLY TO CONCHAN CHINA WE SHOULD NOTE HERE A THE HE THAT'S WHY HE'S THERE BIDNS HAD IN NEWS CONFERENCE TO DAY WE CAN TRACE A FIFTYER ARC OF PROGRESS IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR NATIONS FROM CONFLICT TO NORMALIZATION HE'S TALKING TO THE A GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE COMINIS PARTY IN VEANOM HE SAYS THIIS A NEW ELEVATED STATUS THAT WILL BE A FORCE FOR PROSPERITY AN SECURITY IN ONE MOST CONS QUENTIAL REGIONS IN THE WORLD THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM OF COURSE WHICH THE VANOM IS ALSO A LINE WITH THE RUSSIANS LITERALLY OVER THE WEEK EN VEANOM IS CHASING A SECRET RUSSIAN ARMSTEAL EVEN AS TO DEEP ENTO MERICAN TIES IN ORDER FOR AMERICA TO HAVE A BIG UMBRELLA AMERICA HAS TO HAVE A VERY STRONG UMBRELLA THAT STRONG UMBRELLA HAS TO INCLUDE THINGS LIKE MAKING SURE THAT IF WE THINK THAT VEONOM IS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE WEAPONIZED AGAINST CHINA IT DOESN'T BY ITS WEAPONS FROM THE RUSSIANS WHO ARE ALLIES OF THE CHINESE ALL THIS WOULD BE A LOTLESS COMPLICATED IF HE UNITED STATES ACTUIT TOK A MUSCULAR APPROACH TO THE WORLD BUT JOBIN DOESN'T HAVE A MUSCULAR PROACH THE WORLDS HE SAYS HE DOES BUT THEN HE DOESN'T FILL IN THE GAPS THIS ALSO TRUE WHEN IT COMES YOU CRANE WILL GET TO THAT IN ONE SECOND FIRST EVERYBODY KNOWS I LOVE MA HELIKS MATTRESS HAVE YOU

COMES TO JOBIDONS FORIGN POLICY CONFUSION AND MIX SIGNALS THE S AME THING HOLDS TRUITH REGARDS YOU CRANE SO JUST A SPELL OUT WHAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BE DOING IN YOU CRANE IT'S BEEN PERFECTLY OBVIOUS SINCE NEARLY THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR THAT THIS THING WAS GOING TO END IN E STALE MATE BECAUSE IT WAS GOING TO END IN A STALEMATE IN MADE A LOT OF SENSE FOR THE UNITED STATES TO BASICALY GO TO THE RUSSIANS AND SAY YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP CREMIA YOUREGING TO KEEP PARTS OF THE NONBAS WERGAN GIVES SECURITY GUARANTEES TO OU CRANE AND EVERYBODY CAN GO BACK STABSQUALANTY THAT WAS ALWAYS WHAT THE DEAL SHOUL AVE BEEN TIT WAS ALWAYS WHAT THE DEAL WAS GOING TO BE THE UNITED STATES THIS DOES HAVE AN INTEREST IN DEGRADING THE RUSSIAN MILITARY AND THE TRUTH IS THE MONEY THAT WE'VE SPENT IN OU CRANE CONTRO PUBLIC OPINION THAT MONEY AS ACTULLY BEN MONEY FAIRLY WELL SPENT WE'VE DEGRADED THE RUSSIAN MILITARY DRAMATICALLY THAY NO LONGER HAVE THE CAPACITY TO CROSS OTHER COUNTRY'S BORDERS THET THREAT TONATO HAS BEEN TREMENDOUSLY MITIGATED WHICH IS GOOD FOROUR ALLIES IN THE REGION AND BY THE WAY A LOT OF THE MONEY THT WE'VE SPENT IS IN FACK COMING BACK TO US BECAUSE PROOF OF THE USE OF THOSE WEAPONS ON THE BATTLE FIELD MEANS FOR EXAMPLE THAT OVER THE WEEK END O POLAND ANNOUNCE THATITWAS GOINGTO SPEND ABOUT TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN TERMS TO BUYING AMERICAN MILITARY ARMAMENTS YET ALL THAT CAN BE TRUE AND STILL THERE NEEDS TO BE AN ALL FRAMP HERE BECAUSE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE DYING IN A WAR AND THE BORDERS AREN'T MOVING VERY MUCH AND EVERY CU SIKG MAT OU CRNIAN BREAK THROUGH UKET WHEN WHEN IT HAPPENS THAN ALL BELIEVE IT BUT BASICAL YOU HAVE TO CHROICEIS ONE IS YOU ARM THE U CRANIANS TO THE POIN WHERE THEY ARE CAPABLE OF ACTUALLY JUST DEFEATING THE RUSSIANS THROUGHOUT U CRANE WHICH WOULD MEAN PRESUMABLY GIVING THEM THINGS LIKE OT SUCTEINES OR YOU'RE NOT CUNTO DO THAT WHICH CASE YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING TO CUT SOME SORT OF DEAL BUT INSTEAD THE UNITED STATES AND ITS ALLICES OF CUTSORT THIS HALF WAY MEASURE WHERE THEY SAY SE LENSK'S GON TO LEAD THE NEGOTIATIONS WHICH MEANS NO PIECE CAUSE THE LENSKY IS AN SENDIVISED BY HIS PEOPLE CORRECTLY SO NOT TO GIVE BACK IN INCH OF LAND AND MEANWHILE THE RUSSIANS HAVE NO INSENTE OF TO LIEVE BECAUSE THERE NOT BEING PHYSICALLY FORCED OUT OF DONBAS OR CREMIA AND WHAT THY CAN DO JUST RETREAT FOR NO REASON AND SO THE THINGS JUST CAN GO ON AND ON AND ON MEANWHILE THE LONGER IT GOES ON THE LESS SUPPORT THE UNITED STATES GEN A HALFE FOR THIS THING GOING ON FOR PROLONGE PERIODS OF TIME SO RUSSIA FOR EXAMPLE WHICH IS PART OF THE G TWENTY THEY HAILED THE G TWENTY AS A SUCCESS ACCORDING TO SIANEN RUSSIA ON SUNDAY DEEMED THE G TWENTY SUMMIT IN INDIAS CAPITAL OF NEW DELLY IN UN CONDITIONAL SUCCESS A DAY AFTER THE MEANINGS FINAL DECLARATIONS STOPPED SHORT OF EXPLICITLY CONDEMNING ITS INVASIO OF YOU CRANE SPEEKING AT OPPRESS CONFRENTE AT THE END OF THE SUMMIT RUSSIAN FOR A MINISTER SURGAY LAVROV SAID THE SUMMIT WAS AS SUCCESS NOT JUST FOR INDYA BUT FOR ALL OF US THE FINAL GROUP STATEMENTS HAD QUOTE ALL STATES MUST REFRANE FROM THE THREAT ORE USE OF FORCE TO SEEK TERRITORIAL ACQUISITION BUT IT DIDN'T SINGLE OUT RUSSIA THE STATEMEN AC KNOWLEDGE QUOTE THERE WERE DIFFERENT VIEWS AN A SESSMENTS OF THE SITUATION U CRANE THEN CRITICIZED THE G TWENTY'S FINAL DECLARATION YOU CRANES FORM MINISTRYES SPOKES PERSON WROTE ON FACE BOOT OU CRANE IS GRATEFUL TO ITS PARTNERS WHO TRIED TO INCLUDES STRONG WORDING IN THE TAXTS AT THE SAME TIME THE G TWENTY HAS NOTHING TO BE PROUT OF IN THE FACT THAT RUSSA'S A GRUSSIAN AGAINST YOUCRAN CONTINUES OBVIOUSLY THE PARTICIPATION OF THOU CRANIANSIDE OULD HAV ALLOWED THE PARTICIPANCE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION THE PRINCIPALE OF NOTHING ABOUT YOU CRAN WITHOUT YOU RANE REMAINS AS KEY AS EVER MEANWHILE ANTONY BLINKIN IS TRYING TO PRETEND THAT THIS WATER DOWN STATEMENT IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING POSITIVE AND GOOD YOURS ANSONY BLINK AN TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE SUJECTAPPER GOD IS THIGN IFICANTLY WEAKER LANGUAGE THEN LAST YEARS JORINED STATEMEN WHIC'S CALLED FOR RUSSIAS QUOTE COMPLETE AND UN CONDITION AR WITHDRAWAL ON QUOTE FROM YOU CRANE WAT WHY DID YOU US AGREE TO ALL WATER DOWN DECLARATION THAT DOES NOT EVEN CAN DON RUSSIA BY NAME OR EXPLICITLY CALL FOR RUSSIA TO LEAVE YOU CRANE JE THE JE TWENTY COUNTRIES IN THE STATEMENT ALL STOOD UP FOR THE IMPORTANCE TO TERITOIL INTEGRITY SOVEREIGNTY AH AND TAT'S VERY CLEAR I WAS IN THE ROOM WHEN I ALL THE LEADERS SPOKE TO DAY WITH WITH PRESENT BIDEN AAND IT WAS VERY CLEAR FROM EVERYTHIN THAT THEY SAID A THAT A NOT ONLY THEY WANT TO SEE THI QOREN BHAT THEY WANT TO SEE AT END ON JUST EN DURABLE TERMS AND IT WAS ALSO VERY CLEAR THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF RUSSIAS SIGGRESSION OUR BEING FELT THROUGHOUT OF THE THETHE TWENTY COUNTRIES AND THROUGHOUT THE DEVELOPING WORLD C THIS IS ALL AMUS IT'S ALL AMESSONTOMESS BECAUSE THIS AD MINISTRATION IS EXTREMELY MESSY WHEN IT COMES TO CHINA ARE THEY AGGRESSIVE OR ARE THEY CONCILIATORY WHEN IT COMES TO RUSSIA ARE THEY AGGRESSIVE OR ARE THEY WEAK WHAT EXACTLY IS IT THER AT TEMPTING TO DO NOBODY HAS SHE EXPLAIN WHAT THE WHAT THEY WANT THE FINAL PRODUCT TO LOOK LIKE WHEN WHEN IT CAME TO BROUNDS RAGINS APPROACH THE SOVIA UNION HIS APPROACH WAS VERY SIMPLE WE WIN THEY LOSE NOW THEY COULD BE NEGOTIATION WITHIN THAT FRAMEWOR BUT THE FRAMEWORK WAS YOU ARE OUR ENEMY  WE ARE GOING TO AGGRESSIVELY CONFRONT YOU IN THIS FER UNTIL YOU BEND WHEN IT COMES TO CHINA WE REFUSE TO TAKE THAT VIEW BECAUSE AGAIN WE'VE INTEGRATED OUR ECONOMY WITH THEIRS WHICH IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S WORST WORST MEASURES BY THE WAY YOU CAN ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHY WE WERE DOING THAT FROM SEVENTIES UP THROUGH EIGHTY NINE BUT AFTERTINNAMEN SQUARE THERE IS NO EXCUSE WHATSOEVER FOR THE WEST TRYING TO INTEGRATE ITS ECONOMY WITH CHINA THE ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION OF CHINA WHICH WAS PARTIAL IN THE EXTREME NEVER AMOUNTED TO POLITICAL LIBERALIZATION OF CHINA AND MEANWHILE THROUGHOUR TO RUSSIA WERE SENDING MIX SIGNALS AS WELL AS ON THE ONE HAND WE'RE NOT PROVIDING YOU CRANE THE SUPPORT NECESSARIED ACTUALLY WIN IN YOU GRAINE BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE TELLING THEM YOU'RE LEADING THE NEGOTIATIONS SO INTERMINABLE WAR THAT IS WHAT ALL OF THIS MEANS AND LONGER THIS GOES ON IT DOESN'T FAVOR DEMOCRACIES BY THE WAY AUTOCRACIES OUR FAVORED BY LONG WARS WHY AT BECAUSE VERY OFTEN WHEN IT COMES TO LONG WARSWE SEE NAFGANISTAN OR ROCK DEMOCRACIES LOSE FAITH IN THESE WARS THEY DON'T LIKE THEM DEMOCRACIES YOU WAKE THEM UP AND WE GET REALLY TOUGH THAT WE GET REALLY BIG AND REALLY STRONG VERY QUICKLY AND THEN WE MASS YU BUT IF WE DON'T MASH YOU PRETTY FAST IN AUTOCRAC CAN OUT LIVE YOU BECAUSE HE'S NOT CHANGING AD MINISTRATION ALL IT TAKES FOR AMERICAN FORM POLICY TO SWIVEL ON A DIME AS NEW ELECTION EVERYONE KNOWS THIS AND SO'S JUST A MATTER OF OUTLASTING THE OTHER GOT BET THE TOME A VIONOM OR ROCK OR AFGANISTAN THE ONLY WARS AMERICA WIND SUCCESSFULLY OUR WARS THAT ARE PURSUIT IN VERY SHORT RURDER WITH VERY CLEAR OBJECTIVE AND WERE YOU USE THE AMOUNT OF FORCE NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THAT OBJECTIVE THOSE ARE THE ONLY WARS AMERICA WINDS AND THOSE ARE ALSO THE ONLY WARS AMERICA PREVENCE IS WER WE MAKE CLEAR T EVERYBODY IF YOU CROSS EX LINE WEWILL SMACK YOU SO HARD YOU WILL BE LIVING IN THE STONE AGE THAT AND THEN YOU CAN NEGOTIATE WITHIN THAT FRAMEWORK BUT WE'RE NOT CANO EVEN C ME CLOSE THAT LINE IF YOU COME CLOSE TO THAT LINE WE'RE GAN A NOK YOUR HEAD OFF  DIPLOMACY IS ALWAYS THE VELVET GLUB IT THAT IF THERE'S NO IRON FIST INSIDE THE VELVE GLOVE WHAT IS IT MATTER WHEN YOU'RE VACILLATING WHN YOU'RE WAVERING WHEN O'RE BEING DELIBERATELY ON CLEAR OR MAY BE NOT DELIBERATELY UNCLEAR WHAT EXACTLY'S EVER ONE SUPPOSED TO TAKE AWAY FROM YOUR BEHAVIOR AND JUST ONCE SICON WILL GET TO THE ARYO WHERE JOBIDON BELIEVES HE ACTUALLY DOES HAVE INTERNATIONAL UNITY AN INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP FIRST HOW OFTEN DO YOU PRAY WEL THE ANSWER IS PROBABLY NOT OFTEN ENOUGH SO I AM N ORTHODOX TOU THE MEANS THAT I PRAY THREE TIMES TODAY WHEN IT COMES TO THE BIG HALLIDAYS COMING UP TO BE MORE THAN THREE TIMES A DAY HONESTLY WITHOUT THE PRAYER MY DAY WOULD BE PRETTY UNLIVEABLE BECAUSE YOU NEED TO

ALWAYS NONSENSE WHENEVER SOMEBODY SAYS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO FORGE GLOBAL LEADERSHIP ON LOBEL WARMING IT'S ABSOLUTE NONSENSE IT IS A IT'S A TOSSAWAY LINE TO THE LEFT CHINA AIN'T PARTICIPATING RUSSIA

MUCH LOVE KATY ROGERS WEARLIE OR THE SUMMER PRESIDENT BIDE WAS FEELING HOPEFUL HIS SON HUNTERS WORS HAD STRUCK A PLEADSEL WITH FEDERAL PROSECUTORS ON TAXING GUN CHARGES IT SEMD TOTHE PRESIDENT THE LONG LEGAL ORDEAL WOULD FINALLY BE OVER BUT WHEN THE AGREEMENT COLLAPSED IN LATE JULIVE MISTER BIDIN HIS PUBLIC IMMAGE OFFEN BELIES HIM OR MERCURIAL TEMPERAMENT WAS STUNNED HE PLUNGED INTO SADNESS AN FRUSTRATION ACCORDING TOS SEVERAL PEOPLE LOSE TO HIM WHO SPOKE ON CONDITION OF ANNINIMITY SINCE THEN HIS TONE IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HUNTER HAS BEEN TINGED WITH THE RESIGNATION THA WAS NOT THERE BEFORE HIS CONFIOUNDE SAY NOW WAS THE JUST HIS PIMEN PLANS TO INDITE HUNTER ON GUN CHARGE IN THE COMING WEEKS WHITE HOUSE ADVISERS ARE PREPARING FROR MANY MORE MONTH OF RE PUBLICAN ATTACKS AND THE PROSPECT OF A CRIMINAL TRIAL IN MIDDLE OF THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN REPUBLICANS HAVE CASTTRUM THE HUNTERS TROUBLES AS HE STEW OF NEPITISM AND CORRUPTION WHICH THE BIDE ADMINISTRATION TO NIDES BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THE HUNTER CASE IS A DRAINED POLITICALLEAN EMOTIONALLY AND HIS FATHER AND THOSE WHO WISH TO SEE HIM REELECTED OH THE SAD OLD MAN THAT'S REALLY THE STORY HERES IS IT'S SO SAD IS SIT HE JUST WANTED TO BE A DELIGHTFUL FATHER JEST WANTED TO BE A LOVING FATHER WHICH IS WHY HE WAS SENDING HIS SON TO FOREIN COUNTRIES TOPICK UP BAGS OF CASHON GETING ON THE

RESPONSIBILITY A PERSON CLOSE TO HUNTERS THAT THOSE COMPLAINS ARE EXAGGERATED EXPRESSED AT A TIME WHEN HUNTER WAS FEELING BRUISE OF OF COURSE THERECN TO SAY THAT BECAUSE IF YOU POINT OUT THAT HUNTER

REALLY IS REALLY SO SCREWED UP PRESIDENT BIDON TRIES TO KEEP HIS SON CLOSE WHEN HUNTER ACCOMPANIED THE PRESIDENT ON A TRIP TO IRELAND IN THE SPRING HE TRAVELED ON AIRE FORSE ONE AND SLEPT ON A

HUMANITY PERIOD I'S GREATER THAN THAN COVI THE NEWCLEAR WARD THAN ANYTHING THE GREATEST EMERGENCY FACING HUMANITY IS ACCORDING TO THEM THAT THE PLAN IS GETTING WARMER BY A FEW DEGREES AND THUS WHAT COULDN'T THEY JUSTIFY IN THE NAME OF ALL OF THIS WELL THE MEXICAN THEN THE NE MEXICAN GOVERNOR LUSHANGRISHAM SHE IS SAYING THAT VIOLATORS COULD FACE CIVIL PENALTIES AND A FINE IM UP TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS UNDER THE ORDER RESIDENTS CAN STILL TRANSPORT GUNS TO SOME PRIVATE LOCATIONS LIKE A GUNRAGE OR GUN STORE BUT THE FIREM HAS HAVE A TRIGGER LOCK OR SOME OTHER CONTAINER OR MECHANISM MAKING HIM POSSIBLE TO DISCHARGE THAT THERE'S NO WAY THIS REMOTELY STANDS UP IN QORT THERE'ST NO WAY IT IT IT REMAINS AMAZING TO ME THAT THE SAME PEOPLE WHO DECLARED THAT RULE OF WAS DEEPLY IMPORTANT O THEM MANY OF THEM ARE GOING TO IGNORE THIS AND AND LOOK THE OTHER WAY IND PRETENDEN IT DOESN'T MATTER THE JANUOR SIX ASS AN ASSAULT ON THE RULE OF LAW THAT IT OVERTHREW CONSTITUTIONAL WARMS WELL I MEAN HOW BUT JUST IGNORING THE CONSTITUTION ENTIRELY AS THE MEXICAN GOVERNOR IS DOING PRETTY AMAZING STUFF OVER THERE CAN MEANWHILE DONALD TRUMP WAS AN IWA BACK TO THE HORSE RACE SO DONALD TRUMP WAS WAS OVER IN IWAL OVER LEEGENS TO HIS RON TO SANTIS AND DUM IT SORT OF MIXETO REACTIONS I WOULD SAY SO TRUMP VISITED AN IWA FRAT THE FRAT WAS NATURALLY QUITE WARM TO HIM HEARE SOME THE VIDIA CATIN SANDING HOWISTONS OVER THEIR FOR HIM IU DON'T ATS THE TRO I'M GOIN GOOD ANOW O TIG BOT TOTHIS IS SOM MI TURN OUT I GUESS THE YOUTH LIKE STRUMP BUT WE LA IWA WIT JUST LEFT SOUT THE GOTE LESS TATTER IS AN AMAZING EVENING WE GOT O WONDERFUL IN TER SPEN THERS ONOUT FROM THE GOVERNOR T WERE HERE IN THIS RECEPTION SPININ TROUT  C KCINDEN TO GO OVER TO THE YA AVE THE BORBIR CULD PI THRO TE THE GORGERS ON AT LOOKS LIKE AN ANACOR THE YONERGER SHOT OF THA THAT'S A GLIS WAG IS TRUN TRUMP DOING SOME SOME RETAIL POLITICS WHICH YOU KNON'T GOOD FOR HIM I HE ALSO WENT TO THE IWA FOOTBALL GAME AND THEREIS BIT IF ON LINE CONTRVERSY'SH BROKE OUT OVER WHETHER HE IS BEEN BOOED OR WHETHER HE IS BEING CHEERED TO HERE SORT OF THE RAW FOOTAGE AND AS YOU'LL HEAR THE ANSWERSOME ABOUTH EINININ HEARER DOW HE WON TEN IS WHEN HE WENT DOWN INTAN SCAN TO SPEND MOST OF THE GAME NOT IN THE STANCY WENT NO UWASIN FOR RE LUXURY BOX WHE WER FLIPPING HIM OFF IN ALL THE REST OF IT BUT YOU SEE THERE A BUNCH OF ENTHUSIASTIC PEOPLE THERE IN IWA AS WELL WHICH OF COURSE IS NOT SHOCKHE DID WIN IWA IN THE LAST ELECTION CYCLE LATEST POLES TRUM IWA ARE SHWING TRUMP UP BIG TIME THE IWA STATE CIVIXS POLE THAT WAS RELEASED JUST A FEW DAYS AGO HAS TRUMP UP THIRTY SEVEN POINTS OVER THE REST OF THE FIELD THE ENBYSEEN NEWS TOM WHEN REGISTERE POLE HAS TRUMP UP TWENTY THREE POINS OVER THE REST OF THE FIELD IN IWA NOW IWA IS NETORIOUSLY FICKLE YOU RECALL IT VERY RARELY HAS THE IWA COKS WINNER ACTUALLY BEENTHE PERSON WHO WENT ON TO WIN THE NOMINATION IN FACT THE LAST TIME THE N IWA CAUKUS WINNER IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WENT ON TO WIN THE NOMINATION WAS TWO THOUSAND WHEN GEORGE SHOBY BUSH NARROWLY DEFEATED STEEVE FORBS FORTY ONE O THIRTY ONE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IS RICK SAND TORUM WHO OF COURSE WAS NOT THE NOMINY IN TWHENTY SIXTEEN IT WAS TED CRUWS OF COURSE WAS NOT THE NOMINA SO NOW WHAT HAPPENS IN IWA TRUMP IS MORE VULNABLE AND IWA BUT AS NON CON BE ENOUGH FOR ANY ONE TO DEFEAT HIM IN IWA MAYBE THAT CREATES THE IM PRESSION THAT THE GOD BLEEDS A LITTLE BUT BUT THAT'S REALLY NOT WEARE ALL OF THE HEAVY LIFTING IS GOING TO BE DONE THE SAME THING BY THE WAY IS TRUE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE SO NEW HAMPSHIRE ALSO HAS A SPOTTY HISTORY OF ACTUALLY NOMINATING PRESIDENTS SO NINETEEN NINETY SIX PAPYOU CANON YOUREMEMBER WHEN THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY AND HE DID NOT WINNING THE NOMINATION BOBDOLLA AND IT UP WINNING THE NOMINATION IN TWO THOUSAND JOHN MC KAIN ON THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY THRWING SCARE INTO GEORGE SHALL BE BUSH IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT MC KAIN WHO'S VERY POPULAR NW HAMPSHIRE ONE MAROMNEY DID WIN INTWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND TRUMP ONE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BUT IT'S A BIT OF SPOTTY RECORD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IT SOMENY WIN'S IWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE THAT'S GON THROW SCARE INTO DONALD TRUMP BUT REALLY TRUMPS LAST STAND IF HE WORGE SHOWNING VULNOABILITY IN WRIHT NOUT THE ZULL SPECULATIVE CONSIDERING HIS LEANING BY LEAPS ON BOUNDS IN BOTH OF THOSE STATES WOULD BE SOUTH CAROLINA SOUTH CAROLINA IS BEEN ENTIRELY PREDICTIVE OF THE REPUBLICAN NOMINE EVERY YEAR BUT TWO THOUSAND TWELVE SO IN TO THASINATE IT WAS MC AIN IN TWO THOUSAND WAS GEORGE SHOLL BY BUSHI ON NINETY SIX IT WAS DOLE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT IT WAS GEORGEY SHALL BE BUSH NINETEEN EIHTY T WAS RAGAN SO AGAIN RIGHT NOW IT'S KENMA MOOT POINT HAS TRUMP IS LEADING IN ALL OF THOSE STATES WIT THAT SAID IF HE IS GOING TO SHOW VON NHERABILITY OBVIOUSLY THE PLACSTRICAN A FIRST SEE IT NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF CALENDERS BUT WHOS POLES IS GOING TO BE IWA WERE OTHER CANDIDATES ARE SPENDING AN ALFUL LOT OF TIME SPEAKING OF THE REPUBLICAN HOPES IN TWENTY TWENTY FOR ACCORDING TO NA CONE OVER AT THE NOR TIMES TO ONE OF THE PROBINS FOR REPUBLICANS IS THAT THE SUPPOSED ELECTORAL COLLEGE ADVANTAGE THE REPUBLICANS ENJOY WHICH IS THE WAY THAT THEY'VE ONE A FEW PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS TWENTY SIXTEEN TWO THOUSAND AT THO THOSE ELECTORAL COLLEGE ADVANTAGES MEANING THAT THERE'S CERTAIN STATES WHERE BY WINNING A A A SLIGHT MAJORITY THAT ABLE TO PULL OFF A NARROW VICTORY THAT SEEMS TO BE DISAPPEARING ACCORDING TO NA CONE OF THE YOR TIMES THE EARLY POLES SHOW DONAL TRUMP AND PRESEN BIDEN TIDE NATION WIDES THAT MEAN TRUMP HAS A CLEAR ADVANTAGEINTE BATTLEGRUND STATES THAT DECIDE THELECTORAL COLLEGE IS ITS E REASONABLE QUESTIONS WHEN I SEE QUITE OFTEN IN IS FIRST TWO PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS TRUMP FARED FAR BETTER IN THE BATTLE GROUND STATES THAN HE DID NATION WIDE BUT THERE'S A CASE THE THE ELEC TORAL COLLEGE ADVANTAGE HAS FATED IN TH MINTROM ELECTIONS LAST FALL DEMOCRATS FARRED ABOUT THE SAME IN THE CRUCIAL BATTLE GROUND STATES AS THEY DID NATION WIDE OVER THE LAST YEAR STATE POLES AND A COMPILATION OF MORK TIMES AT SIANA COLLEGE SURVEYS HAVE SHOWN BYDON RUNNING AS WELL OR BETTER IN THE BATTLE GROUNDS AS THAS NATION WIDE BUT THE RESULTS BY STATE BROADLY MIRRORING THE MIDTERMS AND OTHER WORDS THE THE PURPLE STATES ARE GETTING MORE PURPLE IS NOT THE PURPLE STATES ARE RED AND BLUE STATES OR MORE BLUE WHICH IS HOW YOU ACTUALLY WIN THESE NARROW ELECTIONS S THAT PURPLE STATES AREGETTING MORE PURPLE TO BLUE AND THAT RED STATES ARE JUST GETTING MORE RED SO THAT THAT IS A BIT OF A PROBLEM AGAIN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BATTLE GROUND STATES THEY THEY VOTED MORE SIMILARLY TO THE UNITED STATES IN GENERAL IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO THAN THEY DID BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY SO FOR EXAMPLE IN WATS CONSIN IN TWENTY TWENTY OVER ALL THE THEY THEY VOTED AT A AT A DEEP PLUSS FIVE RATES IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION ANTA AND THEN IN THE HOUSE VOTES THEY VOTED ALMOST EVEN RE PUBLICANS IN DEMOCRATS THE POPULAR VOTE DID NOT REFLECT EXACTLY THE SORT OF ELECTORAL VOTE BUT THAT GAP IS BASICALLY SHRINKING NOW AND YOU'R NYOU'E TARYINGTO SEE THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER THTHE THE GAP IS SHRINKING THAT'S A REAL PROBEM FOR REPUBLICANS AS HE POINTS OUT DEMOCRATS HELD THEIR GROUND IN BATTLE GROUND STATES ALLOWING THEM FOR TEN I SEND IT NEARLY HOLD THE HOUSE NATIONALLY RE PUBLICAN HOUSE CANDIDATES WHEN THE MOST VOTES BY ABOUT TWO PER CENTAGE POINTS THE MARTIN IS ALMOST IDENTICAL IN THE PRESIDENTIAL BATTLE GROUNDSLIKE ARIZON A PENNSYLVANIA AND WISCONSIN WHERE RE PUBLICAN HOUSE CANDIDATES ALSO ONE BY A COUPLE OF POINTS ANOTHER WORDS ORE THE NATIONAL NUMBERS ARE MORE REFLECTIVE ARE ARE MORE REFLECTED NOW IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATES THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT' CAN HELP TRUMP OBVIOUSLY NOW IT'S POSSIBLE THT CUN BE FALSE BUT YOU'RE BANKING AGAINST WHATEVER NUMBERS YOU HAVE THAT I'LL SAT AGAIN ITIS IT  CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT ALL THE NUMBERS ARE WRONG AND THAT THEY'RE OFF IT'S ALSO POSSIBLETH THEY'RE NOT AND SO IT OES WORTH WHILE TAKING ALL OF THAT INTO CONSIDERATION I'VE BEEN LOOKING I ALOT OF THE POLES RECENTLY IN SOME OF THE POLES THAT ARE VERY POSITIVE TO REPUBLICAN CONTENDERS IRE RELYING ON A COUPLE OF THINGS TAT I THINK ARE VERY LIKELY TO NOT MATERIALIZED DURING THE ATURAL ELECTION ONE IS MINORITY VOTERS COMING IN AT FIFTY FOUR THIRTY EIGHT FOR EXAMPLE FOR BIDON REPUBLICANS ARE CONSIDERING THAT MEANS HEY LOOK THA MEANS BIDON IS GON A WIN ONLY FIFTY FOUR PER CENT OFTHE VOTE NO WHAT IT MEANS REPUBLICANS RIGAN WHEN THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT THE VOTE THE SEALING ON RE PUBLICAN SUPPORT IS IN THAT POLE IT IS NOT THAT THE REST OF TAT SUPPORT IS GOING TO GO TO REPUBLICANS OR EVEN THAT'S  SPLIT EVENLY BECAUSE REMEMBER ONCE AGAIN FIFTY FOUR PLUSS THIRTY EIGHT IS NINETY TWO THAT'S EIGHT PER CENT OF THE VOTE STILL OUTSTANDING THAT'S NOT CON SPLIT FOUR FOUR RE PUBLICAN DEMOGRAD WHICH MEANS THAT THE GAP IS CAN BE MUCH LARGER THE OTHER GAP THAT I THINK IS GOIN TO BE MUCH MUCH RECTIFIED IS A LOT THESE PULLS RIGHT NOW ARE ARE ROOTED IN LACK OF DEMOCRATIC ENTHUSIASM THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY UNENTHUSIASTI ABOUT YOUR BID IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT ONE DONALD TRUMPS ON THE BALLAT AFT WE'VE HAD TWELVE MONTHS OF COVERAGE OF HIS SUPPOSED CRIMINAL FOIBLES DEMOCRATS ARE GON A CRAWL OF ER BLOTE BROKEIN GLAST OFOKANSTRUMP AT'S SUS REALITY H GETS OUT TURN OUT FOR DEMOCRATSTO GETS HOUT TURN OUT FOR REPUBLICANS IDEALLY IF YOU'RE RE PUBLICAN WHAT YOU WANT IS WHO LOWER TURN OUT FOR DEMOCGRATS AND INCREASE TURN OUT FOR YOURSELF DOMAL TRUMP INCREASES TURN OUT FOR BOTH SO YOU'RE RIGHT NOW FOR EXAMPLE THAR THE RECENT SEAN AND POLE THAT SHOWED TRUMP AND BIDING DEAD EVEN HAVE THE DEMOCRATIC ENTHUSIASM AT SIXTY ONE PER CENT AN THE RE PUBLICAN ENTHUSIASM IN SEVENTY ONE PER CENT I DO NOT THINK THAT MAINTAINS FOR TE ENTIRETY OF THE ELECTION CYCLE OKAESTIME FOR SOMETHINGS I LIKEIN THAN SOME THINGS THAT I HATE SO THINGS I LIKE OVER THE WE GAN BRED LANEL SHRIVERS NEW NOVEL SHOULD WE STAY OR SHOULD WE GO A LANEL STRIVER IS ONE OF THE BEST LIVING NOVELIST SHE'S REALLY TERRIFIC A LOT OF FOR WORK HIS EXCELLENT I SHOE'D MOST FAMOUS PROBABLY FOR ON FOR HER BOOK THAT WAS MADE INTO A MOVY OF THE SAME IN NAME STARRING TOLD US SWINTEN' WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEAVAN O THIS ONE SHOULD WE STAY OR SHOULD WE GO THAT THE PREMISE IS THERE IS A COUPLE AT FIFTY ONE AND THE WOMAN'S DAD HAS DIED OF ALLTEIMERS IAND HE TALKS ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY SUFFERED DURING HIS LAST YEARS BECAUSE IS VERY DIFICULT TO CARE OR APPARENT WITH ELLSTIMERS AND SO SHE IN HER HUSBAN MAKE A PACKS THAT ON THEIR EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY THEYARE GOING TO COMMINT SUISIDE TOGETHER AND VERY VERY DARK SORT OF PREMIS BUT THEN WHAT THE BOOK DOES IS IN VARIOUS CHAPTERS IT SORT OF SPELLS OUT ITERATIONS OF WHAT HAPPENS NAXT THE HIT EIGHTY DID THE SIDE TO DO IT IS ID NOT DO S ONE DESIDE TO DO IT THE OTHER DECIDES NOT TO WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS SOME SORT OF MAGICAL MEDICINE THAT IS CREATED THAT REVERSES TO AGING AND HOW DOES THAT IN PACK LIFE IT'S A WILDLY CREATIVE AND  REALLY INTERESTING BOOK AND IIS ALL ROOTED IN THE SECULAR MODERN NOTION THAT THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS ON THIS PLANET IS SORT OF T LIFE YOU HAVE ON THIS PLAN AND OTHERWARS HIGHER PURPOSE CAN ONLY BE DIVINED BY YOU IT'S ONLY SOMETHING AT IS INTERNAL TO YOU AND YOU CAN SEE HOW THAT DOESN'T WORK OUT TO REALLY ANY ADVANTAGE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF BOKLIC TOE ONE THE ONE PART OF THE ONE CHAPTER THAT LINELL SHRIVER DIDN'T RIGHT BECAUSE LANELL SHRIVER IS IN RELIGIOUS PERSON SHE'S JUST QUASI CONSERMATIVE ON A BUNCH OF ISHES BUT SHE IS NOT A RELIGIOUS PERSON LANEL TRIVER NEVER WRITES THE CHAPTER WHERE THE COUPLE ACTUALLY FINES RELIGION HOW DOS THAT IMPACT THER DECISION MAKING PROCESS IT'S IT BUT BUT IT IS A FASCINATING BOOK IN ITS SPELLS OUT A LOT OF THE SORT OF QUALMS THAT SECULAR MODERNISM FACES OKA OTHER THINGS THAT I LIKE SO JOK OFITCH NO VATJOKE OF ITCH THETHE TENNIS PLAYER HE IS THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME THERE'S NO QUESTION I IT IS NOT JUST THAT HE IS IN AMAZINGLY SKILLED PLAYER YOU

BELIEVE IN IT OR NOT I KNOW THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A JOKE THAT YOU KNOW WHAN I'M SAYING   E E  A AA NA ANAA AGUA TIS A FO MAKER THE FIRST FEATURE CALLED POSTUMOUS COMES OUT THIS SUMMER COMING OUT THE STUFF THAT ALL OF US DON'T KNOW WE DON'T KNOW  SCIENTIS ACTUALLY TRIES TO MEASURE IT THE SENT OF OF TIT FOR CHICACO BOBAGRADIO WHEN OUR PROGRAMME CONTINUES TISMERICAN MY FROM MAR A CLASS TO DAYS PROGRAMM IN DEFENSIVE IGNORANCE STORIES MAKING THE CASE FOR NOT KNOWING THE CASE I ADMIT YOU DO NOT HEAR VERY OFTEN WE AVERIVED AT DAC TWO OF A PROGRAMM AT TWO IGNORANCE FOR DUMMIS SO THE FIRST HALF OF OUR SHOW WE HEARD A WOMAN WHO AS KEPT IN IGNORANCE BY YOUR FAMILY IN THIS HALFE OF THE SHEULGAN A TURN TO PEOPLE WHO WARE JUST IGNORANT THEY JUST DON'T KNOW STUFF THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW WHICH HELLO THERES OUT TO BE ALL OF US SHALL CALL HAS DETAILS AND E PURICAL DETA THERE'S THE STORY ABOUT IGNORANCE THAT DAVID DUNNING REALLY LOVES HE'S A PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSOR AND HE'S EVEN CIGTED IT IN HIS RESEARCH IT'S ABOUT A GY NAME TO MACARTHUR WHEELER WHO IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE ROBBED A COUPLE OF BANKS AND PENNSYLVANIA AND DIDN'T WEAR A MASK AND HE WAS ARRESTED AND THE POLICE A BASELY SAID WHAT WE HAVE YOU ON THE SURVEILLANT SAPES AND HE SAID DOYO DON'T AND THEY SHOWED HIM THE TAPES AND HE SAW HIS FACE ENT AH HE STARED INCREDULOUSLY AND SAID ABUT I WORE THE JUICE I WORE THE JUICE THE JUICE YES APPARENTLY A MACARTHUR WHEETHER WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT SMEARING YOUR FACE WITH LENEN JUICS MADE IT FUZZY ER INVISIBLE TO VIDIO CAMERAS O TOE HIS CREDIT HE HAD ACTUALLY TESTED THIS THEORY HE TOOK IS SELFY BUT I THINK HE MESAME THE CAMERA THE THING ABOUT M CARTHUR WHEELER WASN'T JUST THAT HE WAS AN IDIOT IT WAS THAT HE THOUGHT HE WAS DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT WHICH MADE DAVID DUNNING THING WHEN PEOPLE ARE WRONG OR WHEN THEYRE PERFORMING POORLY OR FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD WHEN THEIR IN COMPETENT DO THEY KNOW THEI'R INCOMPETENT AND HE HAD A GUESS WHICH WAS NO THEY DO NOT KNOW THEIR INCOMPETENT IT SO WE DECIDED TO A DO SOME EXPERIMENTS AND FIND OUT NOW THIS MAY NOT SOUND LIKE SOMETHING YOU CAN EASILY TEST FOR 'S LIKE TRYING TO MEASURE THE HEIGHT AND WEIGHT OF SOMEBODY'S IN SECURITY BUT PROFESSOR DUNNING AND HIS GRAD STUDENT PARTNER JUST IN CRUGER FIGURED OUT AWAY TO DO AT THEY GOT DIFFERENT GROUPS OF UNDERGRADS TOGETHER THIS AS A CORNELL UNIVERSITY AND GAVE THEM ONE OF THREE TUIZZES ONE WAS ON GRAMMAR ANOTHER ON LOGICAL REASONANG AND ANOTHER WEARELY ON HUMOR LIKE WHICH ONE OF THESE JOKES IS THE FUNNIEST AN A PANEL OF CAMEDIANS RATE THE JOKES AHEAD OF TIME AND AT THE END OF THE QUIZZAS THEY ASKED EACH STUDENT A SIMPLE QUESTION HOW WELL DO YOU THINK YOU DID OR MORE SPECIFICALLY IN WHAT PER CENTILE DID YOU LAND THAT IS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE OTHER STUDENTS TAKING THE TEST DO YOU THINK YOU BEAT AND THEN THEY GATHERED TOGETHER ALL OF THAT DAT A AND RAN THE NUMBERS AND I STILL REMEMBER LOOKING AT THE FIRST GRAP A TO THIS DAY AND THE BIG FINDING IS WE TOOK A LOOK AT THE BOTTOM TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF PEOPLE  IN EACH STUDY AL THESE AR THE PEOPLE WHO HAD DONE THE WORST THERE SCORES ARE FALING IN THE ELEVENTH THE TWELFTEH THE THIRTEENTH PERCENTILE INOTHER WORDS REALLY LOW SCORES BUT THEY THINK THEY'R PERFORMING THE SIXTIETH THE SIXTY FIFTH THE SEVENTIETH PER CENTILE AMONG THE BETTER PERCENTILES THAT'S RIGHT THEY THINK THAT THEY AH BEAT OUT AF MAJORITY OF THEIR PEERS AONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE BASICALLY WHERE ABOUT TO GET DEASY ASSE WITH THE EXAMLY'VE JUST HANDED AIN THEY THINK THEY'RE GETTING BES BEPLUSSES WITH THE EXAMPLY JUST HANDED AIN IN SHORT THERE SEEME TO BE A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN INCONPETENCE AND IN OVERWEENING SENSE OF SELF CONFIDENCE IT WASN'T APPARENT IN EVERY POOR PERFORMING STUDENT BUT IT WAS IN THE MAJORITY OF THEM MOST PEOPLE WHO DID BADLY THOUGHT THEY DID JUST FINE OR EVEN GREAT THEY HAD NO IDEA NO ANYBODY WHOAS EVER GONE TO SCHOOL WORKED A JOB OR KNOWN ANY OTHER PEOPLE KNOWS THIS PHENOMENON IS THAT GUY OR LADY WHOSE COKY AND YET HAS NO IDEA WHAT THEIR DOING AND IT'S INFURIATING THAT HERE IN DUNNINGS LAB IT WASN'T JUST AN ANNOYANCE IT WAS A REPEATABLE FINDING THEY DID THIS EXPERIMENT FOUR TIMES WITH FOUR DIFFERENT GROUPS OF STUDENTS AND IT HAPPENED EVERY TIME BOTTOM PERFORMERS THOUGHT THEY WERE AT LEAST ABOVE AVERAGE AND IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE DUNNING IN CRUGER PUBLISHED THEIR FINDINGS IND A PAPER CALLED UNSKILLED AND UNAWARE OF IT AND THEIR CONCLUSION WAS THIS WHEN SOME ONE ASKS SO HOW DO YOU THINK YOU DID AND YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH TO ANSWER YOUR DRAWING ON THE SAME SKILL SET TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION THAT YOU USED TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS ON THE TEST THAT IS THE LACK OF SKILL MEAS THAT ONLY A GOOD MAGA OT OFOF STAKES BUT IT ALSO BES OU NOT CAN BEABLE TO CATCH MISTAKES YOURS ORE ANYBODY ELSES YOU ARE GOING TO THINK OFTEN THAT BUTHYER SAIN IS ABSOLUTLY REASONABLE AH THIS IS THE DOUBLE CURSE IT'S NOT THAT YOUR IGNORANT AND ALSO HAPPENED TO BE OVER CONFIDEN YOU ARE IGNORANT AND IT MAKES YOU OVER CONFIDENT ON THE OTHER HAND STUDENTS WHO SCORED WELL REALLY WERE IN THE HIGHER PERSENTILES THEY TENDED TO GUESS THAT THEY SCORED A LITTLE WORSE THAN THEY ACTUALLY DID AND FOR KIND OF AN ENDEARING RESON THEY FIGURED MOST OF THE KIDS AROUND THEM KNEW AS MUCH AS THEY DID IN OTHER WORDS THEY WEREN'T MISTAKEN ABOUT THEMSELVES THEY KNEW THEMSELVES PRETTY WELL THEY SIMPLY MISJUDGED OTHER PEOPLE THINKING PROBLY AS SMART AS I AM OVER THE YEARS DUNNING AND OTHER RESEARCHERS HAVE RUN THE SAME EXPERIMENT IN DIFFERENT WAYS OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND THE RESULT WAS PERVASER COMPETITIVE DEBATERS WHO WERE DOING BADLY DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE DOING BADLY PEOPLE A CHEST TOURNAMENTS TRAP IN SKET SHOOTERS WHEN THEIRE QUIST ON GUNSAFETY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS YOU'LL FIND FOR SOME PROCEDURES A FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE INTURNS LIKE ATHERINSZATION PROCEDURES EXACTLY AH  SOF THEM THINK THEY KNOW THE SIGNING SO WELL THEY CAN TEACH YIT TO OTHER PEOPLE WHEREAS ZERO OF THEIR INSTRUCTORS AGREE IN FACT FIFTY PERCENT OF THEIR INSTRUCTORS AY KNOW THIS PERSEN US STILL TO BE SUPERVISED WHENEVER THEY DO THIS I GO FALT YE AND LIKE ALL PSYCHOLOGICAL PHENOMENA THIS ONE PRETTY QUICKLY GREW A NAME DUNNING WAS INSISTENT THAT HE AND CRUGER HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE COINNING OF THAT NAME THE NAME THE DUNNING CRUGER EFFECT YOU FEW AH FOR EXAMPLE GO ON TWITTER AND TYPEEN DONNING CRUG YOU'LL SEE IT THE EFFECT MENTION SEVERAL TIMES A DAY SEVERAL TIMES AF DAY SEVERAL TIMES A DAY WHY HAVE A COMPUTER IN FRONT OF ME AGOING TO TWITTER WE JUST PUT N DONNING CRUGER AH OH HERE WE GO TRAMP IS A STATIC DISPLAY OF DUNNING CRUGER IN EFFECT AH WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR BIOLOGY P H T DUNNING CRUGER UNIVERSITY YOURE CLUELESS RANTS MERELY REENFORCE YOUR IGNORENCE TEYS ASOAH VERY HAPPY TO GET A MEAN OUT THEIRE IN THE WORLD UNHAPPY THAT IT IT YET SOMEBONY PEOPLE USIT AS AT EPITHET THAT IS YOUR NAME THATHEIRE USING T EXACLY I'S JUST BECOME A SCIENTIFIC WAY OF CALLING SOMEBODY STUPID WHICH I GUESS WE WERE SORELY IN NEED OF BUT I THINK THE THING THAT A PEOPLE IN GENERAL MISS IS THAT A WERE WE'RE NOT TOING ABOUT THE BRAIN OF THE INCOMPETENT WERE TALKING ABOUT THE BRAIN OF ALL OF US BECAUSE SOONER OR LATER WE STEP INTO THAT GROUP AH SOONEROR LATER WE BECOME THE POOR PERFORMERS WE ALL HAVE AR A SPECIFIC POCKETS OF IN COMPETENCE AND WE KNOW SOME OF THEM BUT THEY'R LOT OF THEM WE SIMPLY DON'T KNOW AND ONCE WE STEP INTO OUR OWN IN COMPETENCE A WE DON'T KNOW WE'VE MADE THE STEP THIS IS REALLY THE DISHEARTENING STONER INSIGHT OF THIS RESEARCH IF YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING WELL IT MEANS ONE OF TWO THINGS ITHER YOU'RE DOING WELL OR YOU'RE NOT DOING WELL AT ALL TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT TOO LONG REALLY DAVID DONING WHO HAS THOUGHT ABOUT IT MORE THAN ANY ONE SAYS IT'S MADE HIM PARTICULARLY VIGILANT ABOUT THE THINGS HE SAYS AND DOES HOW HE ACTS I TRYING TO CATCH A HANDED GLIMPSE OF YOURSELF IN A MIRROR THIS ONE TIME FOR INSTANCE HE WAS TEACHING A GLASS GIVING THEM AN EXAM AND AT THE END OF IT HE ASKED THE STUDENTS THE DONING CROKER QUESTION HOW DO YOU THINK YOU DID AND SURE ENOUGH WHEN HE LOOKED BACK AT THE TESTS HE NOTICE THIS ONE KIT IN PARTICULAR GOT ONE OF THE LOWEST GRADES IN THE GROUP AND RADED IT HIMSELF IN THE ADY AT THE PERCENTILE AND I DECIDED I WHI AM COU A PIQUE AT THE NAME BECAUSE I I JUST HAVE A SUSPICION I'M GOING TO SEE THIS PERSON AID MY OFFINCEAND INDEED WHEN THE TEST WAS HEADED BACK YEU DID COME INTO MY OFFICE AH BECAUSE HE DID WANT TO OFFER ME A CHANCE AGRACIOUSLY TO ADMIT THAT THE ANSWERS THAT I HAD DESIGNATED AS CORRECT ON THE EXAM WERE ACTUALLY WRONG AH AH AND SO HE'S REALLY TRYING TO HARD TO BE GRACIOUS I COULD SEE SOME VIBRATIONS OF OUTRAGE AH IN HIS BODY AND PART OF MY BRAIN IS GOING AND WATCH THIS ANALYZS WHAT'S GOING ON WHAT PSYCHOLOTIALLY HAPPENING THEY VE GOT ANOTHER PART BY BRAIN KAND GOING ARE YOU SURES MUT TO YOU AR YAU SRTS TABECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD BE EMBARRASSING AA FOR A PERSON WHO HAS PROPOSE THE DUNNYG CROK REFRAING WORK TO AH ACTUALLY PUBLICLY DISPLAYED ONIN CROOKER AH BUT THE SAD SAD TRUTH IS WHAT I DEARLY LOVE A WOULD BE A TO BE ABLE TO SEE ME IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE AH TO BE AWARE OF O KA AH HE I AM HAVING AT ANY CROKER MOMAH AT AHACCORDING TO MY OWN THEORY I'LL NEVER HAVE IT THAT'S BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE CAN SEE WHEN WE'RE DOING THE DONING CROOKER DANCE BUT WE CAN'T WHICH MAKES YOU THINK WHY DOESN'T ANYBODY SAY ANYTHING WHEN IT'S LITTLE STEFF YOUR LIES DOWN YET STUFF IN YOUR FACE YOURE REAL FRIENDS AND EVEN SOME STRANGERS WE'LL TELL YOU BUT SOMEHOW WHEN YOU'R BLOWING A HUGE WORD BALLOON FULL OF WRONGNESS THAT'S WHEN THE REST OF US DECIDE TO BE POLITE TO GO ALONG CAUS TO CORRECT THAT WE ARDLY CONFIDENT KNOW NOTHING JERK IN THE OFFICE JUST SEEMS MEAN IT'S NOUR PLACE BUT MAYBE IT'S MEANOR NOT TO CORRECT HIM THE REAL SADNESS FOR ME IS THAT OFTEN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SUFFER FOR THEIR MISTAKES AH BUT THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO KNOW IT BECAUSE IF A PERSON IS A JERK IN THE OFFICE AH WHAT HAPPENS IS ALL THE PARTIES THEY AREN'T INVITED TO AAH THE WONDERFUL SOCIAL INTERACTIONS THEY JUST DON'T GET TO EXPERIENCE AND IT'S LIKELY THAT THEY DON'T NOTICE THE ABSENCE OF THIS SO YOU DON'T KNOW YOU'RE INCOMPETENT AH YOU CAN'T FIGER IT OUT IN YOUR AWN AND THE WORLD IS TREATING YOU BY BEIN SILENT WELL HOW DO YOU IMPROVE YOURSELF UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS I SHOULD SAY THE DUNNING AND CROOKER'S RESEARCH HAS BEEN CRITICIZED OVER THE YEARS OTHER RESEARCHERS HAVE TRIED TO PUNCH HOLES IN THEIR CONCLUSION EVEN GOING SO FAR AS TO PUBLISH PAPERS WITH ALTERNATIVE STATISTICAL EX PLANATIONS OR DONING IN CROKER'S FINDINGCE AND DONING SAYS HE AND HIS PARTNER HAVE RESPONDED TO THOSE CRITICS IN BRIND AND MAY HAVE CONVINCED SOME THUT CERTAINLY NOT ALL OF THEM WHICH HE ACTUALLY TAKES TO BE A PLUS BECAUSE THE CRITICS THEY HAVEN'T CONVINCE ARE REALLY CONFIDENT IN THEIR OPINIONS AND DONING AN CRUGER ARE REALLY CONFIDENT IN THEIRS SO ONE OR THE OTHER IS DEAD WRONG AND JUST DOESN'T KNOW IT O SHALL CALL IS ONE OF THE PRODUCES OF OR SHOW A THREE FORGET ME NOT I BROG THEM TO DAYS ABOUT IGNORANCE OF COURSE A HUGE PART OF ALL OFOUR IGNORANCE IS THE STUFF THAT WE USED TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE ALL FORGOTTEN ALL OUR LIVES THERE'S HUGE UNDERTO OF FORGETTING THAT SUX OLD CLASSMATES NAMES INTO THE ABYSS THE FRENCH THAT WE STUDIED THAT WE NEVER USED IN POTS AND CAS OF FAVORITE MOVIES WE USED TO LOVE THAS THIS OF COURSE SEE THIS IS A CURSE COUDING STEPHANY FOO I HAVE SEVERAL LARGE UNWIELDY BOXES STACKED IN CORNERS OF MY APARTMENT I ALMOST NEVER OPEN THEM TUT I'VE SLEPT THESE

STARTING JOURNALS I WROTE WHEN I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE WHOLE WEEKS EVEN MONTHS OF MY LIFE THAT HAVE JUST DISAPPEARED INTO THE BISS OF FORGETFULNESS IS HORRIFYING TO ME IF I CAN'T TAKE THESE MEMORIES WITH ME TO THE REST OF MY LIFE THEN WHAT'S THE POINT OF EVEN LIVING THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE TO HOLD ON TO THE PAST A COUPLE TIMES A MONTH I'LL SIT IN MY KITCHEN TABLE ONE IN MY

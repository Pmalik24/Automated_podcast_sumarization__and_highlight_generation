ACROSS HIS FACE HE WAS DOING IT PERFECT REALLY JUST LIKE A T V INDIAN I DIDN'T BELIEVE HE WOULD REALLY SHOOT ME SO I JUST SAT THERE LIKE A JACKASS MY HANDS FULL OF DIRT I DIDN'T SEE HIM LET GO OF THE BOWSTRING BUT I CERTAINLY DID HEAR THE FHOP THE AROW MADE WHEN IT HIT ME IN THE CHEST DEAD SENTER MORE FROM THE SURPRISE THAN ANYTHING I FELL FLAT ON MY BACK IT WAS ONLY A TARGET ARROW BUT IT PIERCED MY STERNHAM JUST ENOUG TO STAND UPRIGHT FROM MY CHEST WAVING AROUND SLUGGISHLY LIKE A REED IN A RIVER I LAY IN THE GRASS AND STARED UP AT THE KNEON YELLOW FLETCHING OF THE ARROW MY HANDS WERE STILL FULL OF DIRT DONALD JUMPED DOWN FROM THE DOG HOUSE AND STOOD OVER ME HE WAS SMILING AN ODED SATISFIED SMILE AS IF HE WAS EXPECTING TO BE CONGRATULATED ON HIS MARKSMAN SHIP HE LOOKED DOWN AT ME FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE HE GENTLY PUT HIS HAND AROUND THE SHAFT OF THE ARROW WITHOUT PULLING IT OUT HE SAID  MIGHT SMACK DAB IN THE HEART WHITE N I TOLD DONALD I WANTED HIM TO NAME THE ARMADELLO AFTER SEVERAL DAYS OF DELIBERATION HE DECIDED TO NAME IT AFTER ODIS BHE HAPPY DRUNK ON THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW WHO OUR FATHER HAD RESEMBLED IN ALMOST EARIY DETAIL I'D GOTN USED TO TAKING CARE OF DONALD ALONE I HAD NO CHOICE BUT ODIS WAS A DIFFERENT STORY FIRST OF ALL ODIS SMELLED HE GAVE OFF A MUSKY ODOR THAT INTENSIFIED WHENEVER HE WAS NERVOUS OR HUNGRY AND NO MATTER IF WE SCRUBBED HIM RAW WITH INDUSTRIAL SOAP AND WATER THE SMELL WOULD COME BACK IN AN HOUR OR SO AND THEN THERE WAS THE FURNITURE ARMADILLAS OR BURROWING ANIMALS THIS IS SOMETHING I LEARNED FROM MY FATHER AND IN THE CONFINES OF OUR SMALL APARTMENT ODIS DIDN'T HAVE MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO BURROW INSTEAD HE WOULD MARCHED THROUGH THE HOUSE LIKE A TINY GRAY TANK AND MOVED THE FURNITURE AROUND HE'D WADDLED INTO THE LIVING ROOM PUT HIS BLUNT FOREHEAD AGAINST ONE OF THE LEGS OF THE COFFEE TABLE AND BARE DOWN INCHING IT AROUND THE ROOM HIS LITTLE SQUIRREL CLAWS SCRABBLING ON THE ROOD FLOOR AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK HE WOULD CRAWL BETWEEN THE MACTRESS AND BOCXSTRINGS OF MY BED AND TAKE A DUMP MY FATHER WAS RIGHT ABOUT ARMADELLAS THEY ARE HARDY THEY ARE RESOURCEFUL AND IF O ODIS'S TYPICAL THERE AS DOME IS DONKEY CRAT SOMETIMES IN THE COURSE OF HIS INCESSANT APARTMENT WANDERING ODIS WOULD FIND HIMSELF TRAPPED IN A CORNER AND WULD SPEND THE REST OF THE EVENING ANDTEMPTING TO CLAW HIS WAY OUT ODIS WAS TECHNICALLY MY PET BUT DONALD CARED FOR IND LURRIED OVER HIM TORMENTED HIM TEESED HIM THEN MADE UP WITH TEARFUL PROFESSIONS OF REGRET AND AFFECTION WHILE I WAS AWAY AT WORK THEY WOULD DO THINGS TOGETHER DONALD WOULD CARRY ODI SAROUND OUTSIDE CONVERSING WITH HIM ROODING IN THE WEEDS IND THE VACANT LOT SEARCHING FOR EARTH WORMS FOR CRICKETS FOR ODIS'S DINNER SOMETIMES DONALD WOULD HIDE BEHIND THE RECLINER AND WHEN ODIS PASSED BY WOULD JUMP OUT AND SHOUT IN A HIGH SUPPRANAL WALE LOOK OUT ODIS POOR ODIS WOULD SPRING TWO FEET INTO THE AIR LIKE A STARTLED CAT HIS LEATHERY BODY TWISTING HIS CLAWS CLUTCHING AT NOTHING AND ONCE HE'D LANDED HE'D SCURRY INTO THE HALLWAY LOOKING BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER AND BARRISNENT IN THOSE LITTLE PIGGY EYES HIS KIND OF LIVING ARRANGEMENT WAS NO BOOSE TO MY SOCIAL LIFE I CAN TELL YOU IF I EVER WANTED TO BRING A GIRL HOME I FIGURED I'D HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY EXPLAINING WHY THE APARTMENT SMELLED LIKE A BEARS DIM WHY THE FURNITURE WAS STREWN AROUND AND WHY MY BROTHER WAS NAKED AND HIDING BEHIND THE COUCH WAITING TO SCARE THE DAYLIGHTS OUT OF AN ARMADILLA IT TOOK FIVE YEARS BEFORE I FOUND SOME ONE I LOVED ENOUGH TO BRING HOALD ALLISON WAS GOOD ABOUT EVERYTHING TOLD ME I WAS A SAINT IN A CHRISTIAN TO BE TAKING CARE OF DONALD SHE WAS SO WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL AND GOOD SMELLING I COULD BARELY STAND IT EVENTUALLY I PROPOSED TO HER AFTER WHICH I WENT HOME TO TALK TO DONALD IT WAS SPRINGTIME IN THE DESERT THE SMELL OF CACKT IS BLOSSOMS EVERYWHERE AND I WAS SO FULL OF LOVE AND DESIRE I COULD BARELY SEE STRAGHT ALLISON AND I HAD DECIDED THAT WE WOULD GET AN APARTMENT NEAR BY THAT WASH MY NEW PROMOTION AT HOSSON FEFFERS AND ALLISON'S JOB AT THE COUNTY COURT HOUSE WE COULD AFFORD OUR OWN PLACE AND WITH THE HELP OF THE GOVERNMENT SUPPORT DONALD DONALD WOULD BE ALL RIGHT AS LONG AS WE CHECKED ON HIM DAILY MADE SURE HE WAES TAKING AS MEDICATION AND OCCASIONALLY WASHED DOWN THE PLACE WITH A MONIA SO THE SMELL WHEN BOTHER THE NEIGHBORS I HAVE TO ADMIT THE THOUGHT OF ESCAPING FROM DONALD AND ODIS AND THAT CAVE OF AN APARTMENT WAS ALMOST AS ENTICING AS THE THOUGHT OF BEING TOGETHER WITH ALLISON AT HOME WHEN I SAT DONALD DOWN TO EXPLAINTHINGS TO HIM I COULD BARELY GET A WORD OUT I STUDTERED AND SDAMMERED KEPT WIPING MY MOUTH WHEN I FINALLY MADE THINGS CLEAR DONALD WHIPPED OUT AS MANY BIABLE AND FRANTICALLY PAGE THROUGH IT BUT COULDN'T SEEM TO COME UP WITH ANYTHING THE FIRST TIME I HAD EVER SEEN HIM AT LOSS FOR A SCRIPTURE HE YANKED AT HIS HAIR AND GROUND HIS TEETH TOGETHER UNTIL THEY SQUEAKED FINALLY WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING HE SNATCHED UP ODIS WHO HAD BEEN NAPPING UNDER ONE OF THE COUCH CUSHIONS AND WENT INTO THE LAUNDRY ROOM SLAMMING THE DOOR BEHIND HIM I FELT LIKE KICKING THAT DOORDOWN AND RINGING HIS NECK COULD'T HE AT LEAST TRIED TO BE HAPPY FOR ME TO THINK OF SOMEBODY OTHER THAN HIMSELF FOR ONE MINUTE I WANTED ONLY TO BE WITH ALLISON AND I HATED DONALD FOR MAKING IT SO DIFFICULT HATED HIM FOR THE YEARS OF RESPONSIBILITY AND OBLIGATION AND LOST OPPORTUNITIES HATED HIM IN THE WAY ONLY A BROTHER CAN HATE THE BROTHER  I TOOK A FEW STEPS TOWARD THE SDAREWELL TO LEAVE I DIDN'T CARE I WAS GOING TO STAY AT ALLISONS I FIRST NIGH'D EVER AWAY FROM DONALD WHEN I HEARD A SPLASHING NOISE FOR INSIDE THE APARTMENT THE LAUNDRY ROOM DOOR WAS LOCKED AND I SHOUTED DONALD'S NAME BUT GOT NO RESPONTS I TRIED TO KICK IN THE DOOR WHICH WAS MADE OF SOMETHING LIKE CARDBOARD MY FOOT WENT RIGHT THROUGH IT ONCE I HAD MY LEG FREE I LOOKE THROUGH THE SPLINTERED HOLE AND COULD SEE DONALD HUNCHED OVER THE OVERFLOWING UTILITY SINK BOTH ARMS SUBMERGED UP TO HIS BYSEPS THE BACK OF HIS NECK WAS PURPLE AND PULSING FULL OF ANGRY BLOOD AND IT TOOK ME ONLY A MOMENT TO UNDERSTAND HE WAS TRYING TO DROWN ODIS I UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND GRABBED HIM FROM BEHIND BUT HE RESISTED ME GRUNNING AND PLUNGING ODIS DEEPER INTO THE WATER I WRESTLED HIM OUT INTO THE LIVING ROOM ERE WE FELL SIDEWAYS AGAINST THE COUCH DONALD TWISTED AWAY FROM ME AND STOOD UP THE WATTER DRIPPING OFF HIS ELBOWS FORMING A PUDDLE AROUND HIS SHOES ODIS WAS CURLED UP IN A BALL JUST LIKE WHEN HE SLEPT AND DONALD BEGAN TO SHIVER SO BADLY THAT HE LOST HIS GRIP AND LET ODIS'S BODY SLIDE OUT OF HIS HANDS AND HIT THE FLOOR WITH A WET SLAP DONALD'S FACE TWISTED INTO A MASK OF CONCANTRATED GREEF SEE HE WEPT SEE WHAT I DID LOOKING AT MY BROTHER I FELT ALL THE PARTS OF ME THAT HAD BEEN OPENING UP SINCE I HAD MET ALLISON COLLAPSE ON EACH OTHER LIKE SO MANY EMPTY ROOMS HIT WOULD HAVE TO BE ME AND DONALD BROTHERS INSEPARABLE NO ONE ELSE ALOWED I DON'T REMEMBER IF I LOOKED AWAY OR IF IT WAS AS SUDDEN AS IT SEEMED BUT ONE MOMENT ODIS WAS AS SAD WET CORPSE AS DEAD AS AN ARMADELLO COULD BE AND THE NEXT HE WAS HUFFING AND TWITCHING AND SCRABBLING TO HIS FEET DONALD LET OUT AN ARCHING SHRIEK WHICH SENT ODIS ZIGZAGGING INTO THE KITCHEN WHERE A MAD CHASE ENSUED DONALD SLIPPING AND FLAILING NOCKING OVER CHAIRS AND PULLING DOWN THE DRAPES STILL CHOKING AND SOBBING NOW WITH RELIEF HE FINALLY

BUNCH OF D V DS OF THE EVENT THAT THERE'D BEEN A SORT OF CONVERGENCE OF SILLINESS AT THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN DEBATE AND I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SILLINESS AS A CORRECTIVE TO WHAT I FIGURED WOULD BE

YOU DO THE OTHER PART WE W WE W RACO OEN WEOW AN WE WE KEEP IN MIND THAT THE STAGEIS SET UP WITH ELECTUR AND MICROPHONES TABLES WITH PROFESSORS SEATED AT THEM FACING THE AUDIENCE JUST LIKE SOME EARNEST THINK TANKSPONSERED POLITICAL DISCUSSION OR LIKE A COLLEGE DEBATE A PROFESSOR OF EDUCATION SHOWED UP ON STAGE IN A FORMAL ACADEMIC ROBE AND THEN TOOK IT OFF TO REVEAL A SUPERHERO COSTUME TO AUDIENCE CHEERS WHO HAS CAPTAIN EDUCATION DE HIS RIGHT WAS AN ART HISTORY PROFESSOR WHO ARGUED THAT THE POST OPOCULYPTIC WORLD WOULD BE BLEAK WITHOUT IMAGES ND THE SURVIVORS WE NEED IN OUR HISTORIANC TO GET THE MOST OUT OF ANY IMAGES THEY CREATED OR CONCLUSION OUT OF THE BLUE WE CAN BUILD A NEW WORLD A BATTER WORLD A WORLD IN WICH WIMIN HAVE THE POWOR REMEMBER IT'S THE MAN WHOLOK T US INTO THIS MAST THE CHAIR OF THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENT TRIED BREEFLY TO ARGUE FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF STORY TELLING IN HUMAN CULTUR AND THEN USED UP MOST OF HIS TIME RECITING A THREE MINUTE AND FIFTEEN SECOND POEM HE MADE UP ABOUT A MYTHICAL WOMEN'S FOOTBALL TEAM AT THE UNIVERSITY AND ITS CHAMPION KICKER MIGHTY MITZY MIGHTY MITSE MI GET TO KICK ONCE MORE SHES PUT IT THROUGH FOR THREE GOOD POINTS FOR FOOT WES SURE TO SCORE WATCHING E DEBATE I FOUND MYSELF GETTING STRANGELY MAD LIKE IAD GONE TO A WRESTLING MATCH AND ALL THE WRESTLERS WORRIED THAT THE AUDIENCE WOULD FIND WRESTLING TOO VIOLENT SO THE JUST WALKED AROUND DOING THE PREENING AND SMACK TALKING AND AS I REMEMBER IT PRETTY MUCH EVERY STUDENT GETTING A LIBERAL ARTS DEGREE WORRIES AT SOME POINT THAT THEIR EDUCATION MIGHT ACTUALLY BE USELESS THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE LIFERAFT DEBATE A FUNNY IDEA AND A SERIOUS ONE IT'S A FOREUM FOR THE STUDENTS TO SAY TO THEIR PROFESSORS MAKE US BELIEVE IN THE VALUE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE THAT CAUSE SEEMED LOST IN THIS DEBATE AND THEN THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE GOT UP TO RESCUE US ALL EVERY LIFERAFT DEBATE HAS A DEVIL'S ADVOCATE HE MAKES THE SAME ARGUMENT EVERY YEAR VOTE FOR NO ONE AND HE NEVER WENT IN THIS DEBATE TE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE WAS AN UNTENURED ENGLISH PROFESSOR NAMED JOHN SMITH WHO WHEN HE HEARD HOW THE DEBATE WAS GOING THREW OUT MOST OF HIS PREPAIRED NOTES AND SPOKE OFF THE CUFF MAKING THE MOST IMPASSION SPEECH OF THE ENTIRE EVENT AND ONE OF THE MOST SATISFYING SPEECHES HAVE HERD IN A LONG TIME I'M GOING TO LET PLAY THROUGH THE END I REQUIRED MI FRESHMENT TO COM TO THIS BECAUSE I THUGHT TUS RECOVERING ARGUMENT THAT THEY WOULD BE EXPOSED ARGUMENT GAS I AM SO SORRY WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE HISTORY OF THE LIFE RAFT DEBATE AND TRY TO EXPLAIN HOW WE GOT TO THE PRESENT PASS A BY WAY I GUESS OF APOLOGY IT USED TO BE THAT THE LIFE R AFT DEBATE WAS A IT'S ESPONSER BY THE PHILOSOPY CLUB AND IT WAS A FAIRLY SAM I PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION ABOUT WHICH DISCIPLINES TRULY CONTRIBUTED THE MOST TO A LIBERAL EDUCATION THAT'S WHAT WAS BEING CONTESTED I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE THE WHOLE TEN YEARS THAVE BEEN DOIN IT BUT I'VE BEEN HERE FIVE AND I CAN DIMLY REMEMBER WHEN MICHAEL PATEN ONE HE WAS FUNNY BUT HE ALSO MADE A CASE HE MADE A SERIOUS ARGUMENT SEE IF PARKER THE NEXT YEAR ONE HE MADE A GOOD ARGUMENTWHICH IS A DOUBLE ACHIEVEMENT BECAUSE SOCIOLOGY IS NOT A REAL DISCIPLINE BUT SOMETHING WHENT TERRIBLY AWRY IN ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND FORE AND I CAN'T REMEMBER THIS CAUSE I WAS ON THE STAGE WILSON FAULIN STOOD ON A CHAIR AND DECLARED THAT GOD IS A HIS STORYAN AND THE AUDIENCE ATE IT UP AND VOTED FOR HIM A HE WAS THEY DIDN'T WEREN'T REALLY VOTING FOR WILSON FAULIN THE SCHOLAR OR THE HIS STORIAN I'M SURE HE'S BOTH THOSE THINGS BUT TEY WRE VOTING FOR WILSON FOUND THE BAPTIST PREACHER THE NEXT YEAR YOU VOTED FOR A COOK AND I THOUGHT I COULDN'T GET ANY WORSE IN THE YEAR AFTER THAT YOU VOTED FOR AT ADMINISTRATOR YOU'VE BROUGHT YOURSELF TO THIS BECAUSE SERIOUSLY THESE ARE SMART PEOPLE UP HERE THEY HAVE STOOPED TO SOME OF THE STUPIDEST CRAP TO MAKE YOU LAUGH AND ALL OF US WHO ARE A SERIOUS TEACHERS SOMETIMES CAN FALL INTO THAT TRAP WE WANT TO BE FUNNY WE WANT TO BE ENTERTAINING AND WE GET THIS SENSE THAT IF THEI'R LAUGHING WE MUST BE TEACHING IT ISN'T ALWAYS TRUE I THINK THERE'S A GENERAL ARGUMENTATIVE FALLACY THAT'S GONE ON WITH EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE POOR PEOPLE UP HERE AND I DONTKNOW OW THEY GOT SUCKED INTO IT TIS PROBABLY YOUR FAL IH IT'S WHAT I CALL THE SHERRY FORD FALLACY SHERRE YOU HERE TO NIGHT O YOU MAY REMEMBER THIS FROM THE TWO THOUSAND AND FOR DEBATEITS IT'S ALWAYS STUCK IN MY MIND SHERRY ARGUED THAT BECAUSE YOU NEED TO COMMUNICATE TO HAVE SEX YOU NEED A COMMUNICATIONS PROFESSOR TO HAVE SEC I'M PRETTY SURE YOU DON'T I MEAN IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE IMAGES ARE GREAT BUT WE HAVEN'T YET HEARD THE CASE MADE HOW MUCH YOU NEEDET OUR HISTORIAN TO HAVE IMAGES YOU PROBABLY GANT HAVE IMAGES ANYWAY EDUCATION IS WONDERFUL BUT PEOPLE WERE DOING EDUCATION FOR A COUPLE OF THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE SOME ONE GOT THE IDEA OF HAVING EDUCATION PROFESSORS AH PEOPLE BEEN TELLING STORIES FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE THERE WARE DEPARTMENTS OF ENGLISH AND FOREIGN LANGUAGE ISN'T SO FORTH AND I HATE TO DO THAT BECAUSE THAT'S MY OWN DISCIPLINES I HAVE TO SHOOT DOWN BUT GOOD LORD THE I READ A RECIDED A POEM AT'S NOT AN ARGUMENT LOOK FOLKS IT'S GONE TOO FAR A IT'S YOU WEREN'T YOU YOU MAY HAVE BEEN ENTERTAINED FOR THE LAST HALF HOUR OR SO FORTIFI MENSE WHATEVER BUT I DON'T THINK YOU WERE INTELLECTUALLY CHALLENGED I DON'T THINK A STRONG CASE WAS MADE FOR ANYBODY'S DISCIPLINE AND I HONESTLY THINK THE LIFE RAFT DEBATE HAS GOT IN KIND OF FAR AWAY FROM WHAT INITIALLY USED TO BE AND WHAT IT SHOULD BE YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO NIGHT TO CHANGE THAT YOU IT DEVOTE FOR NO ONE IS NOT TO SAY OH I DON'T LIKE ANY OF THEM OR THE'RE NOT ALL FUNNYER TEY'RE NOT CHARMING OR WHATEVER IS JUST TO SAY COME ON TREAT US LIKE A DULSE ARGUE FOR YOUR DISCIPLINE YOU CAN DO THAT AN BE FUNNY BUT PLEASE YOU CAN SEND THAT MESSAGE AND I HOPE TO NIGHT YOU WILL ERE'S WHAT I REAL IFE WHEN I FELT SO THRILL THAT THE STUDENTS FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER IN THE LIFE RAFTERBATE VOTED FOR THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE AT SOME POINT FOR ME THE WHOLE THING BECAME A METAPHOR FOR POLITICS IN THE UASS RIGHT NOW THE NON DEBATES THE PANDERING THE FLIMSINESS THE ENDLESS STAGE CRAFT AND ALL OF IT SWALLOWING UP THE SERIOUS PEOPLE ALONG WITH THE VACUOUS ONES PART OF THE TIME I WAS SEATED IN THE BLEACHERS WATCHING IT AND THEN PART OF THE TIME I WAS OFF TO THE SIDE PACING MADLY JOHN SMITH THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE HIMSELF ALSO SAW POLITICS IN THE DEBATE WHEN I GOT IN TOUCH WITH HIM AFTER WATCHING THERE IS A DEGREE TO WHICH WE SORT OF EXPECT PUBLIC DISCOURSE IS IS GOING TO BE JUST HORRIFICALLY DEBASED THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THESE GOT ALFUL ARGUMENTS AND THERE'S THERE'S NOTHING ELSE I AXCEPT CRAPPY EMOTIONAL APPEALS THAT MAYOR MAY NOT ACTUALLY IMPACT ON REAL ISSUES ISO ONE THING THAT DID FEEL REALLY GOOD IS THAT THE STUDENTS RESPONDED THEY SAID NO WE DO CARE ABOUT SUBSTANCE CARRYING ABOUT SUBSTANCE DOESN'T MEN WE HAVE TO SURROUND OURSELVES WITH MASSIVE BORES BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE TO STIFFEN OUR SPINES AND RAYS OUR STANDARDS WHICH JOHN SAYS HE'S DONE WITH HELP FROM ROLL MODELS PEOPLE LIKE SIMON COWL ACTUALLY HAVE DONE WONDERS FOR US AS TEACHERS SIMON COWAVAV AMERCANITE OF OF AMERCANITA RIGHT AS OF THE NOINTIES EVERYBODY WAS SO FRICKAND CONCERNED WITH EVERYBODY'S SELF ESTEEM THA IT WAS VERY HARD TO JUST ACTUALLY COME OUT AND SAY SOMETHING A THAT EVERYBODY KNEW IS TRUE BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERCEIVED AS BEING IN POLITE IT BECAME VERY HARD OR UNUSUAL IF YOU ACTUALLY SAID YOU KNOW THIS IS A BAD ARGUMENT OUGHT TO A STUDENT ON A PAPER AM A YOU AND AND YOU WOULD THINK THAT STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP AND BEING TOLD THEIR SPECIAL ALL THE TIME THIS IS EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT YOU KNOW THEM LONEALS AS THE THE GENERATION THAT WERE BROUGHT UP BEING TOLD THEIR SPECIAL ALL THE TIME WOULD BE THESE FRAGILE NARSISSISTS WHO WOULD COLLAPSE AT THE INSTANT THAT THEY GOT SOME REAL CRITICISM BUT WHAT I FOUND A IS THAT THEY'RE QUITE ROBUST IN THE YEARS SINCE JOHN SPOKE AND TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE LIFE RAFT DEBATE HAS BEEN MORE SUBSTANTIVE WHILE STILL BEING FUNNY ONE YEARE A HISTORY PROFESSOR TOLD THE AUDIENCE THAT HISTORY SHOWS THAT IN THE CHAOS FOLLOWING A GLOBAL CATASTROPHE ONE PERSON ON THE LIFE RAFT ONE OF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE HE SAID WOULD DEFINITELY BECOME A DICTATOR AND HE AS A HISTORIAN WOULD BE THE IDEAL ADVISER TO THIS DICTATOR TO TELL THEM HOW TO BE BENEVOLENT A MATHEMATICS PROFESSOR ALL IN CAMAPHLIGE DEAR CALMLY ARGUED THAT WITHOUT MATHEMATICS THE LIFE RAFT SURVIVERS WOULD HAVE TROUBLE NAVIGATING ANYWHERE AND BUILDING ANYTHING DURABLE ONCE THEY GOT THERE HE ALSO

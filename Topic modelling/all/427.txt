WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAPONCENS A SCIENCE SCIENCEPACE TO  I MAN DRUWHUBERMAN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE DISCUSSING FERTILITY WE WILL DISCUSS MALE FERTILITY AND FEMALE FERTILITY AND I SHOULD MENTION THAT TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS NOT JUST FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEKING TO CONCEIVE CHILDREN OR WHO WANT TO KNOW HOW THEIR CHILDREN WERE CONCEIVED BUT IT'S REALLY FOR EVERYBODY AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE IT IS THE STORY OF ALL OF US ALL OF US ARE HERE BECAUSE A SPECIALIZE SET OF CELLS CALLED GERM CELLS THAT IS THE SPERM AND THE EGG AND I'LL MAKE IT VERY CLEAR WHY THEY'RE CALLED GERMCELLS ELIMIT LATOR HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH INFECTION BUT IT'S BECAUSE A SPERM CELL AND AN EGGCELL ARRIVED AT ONE ANOTHER EITHER INVIVO INSIDE OF OUR MOTHER OR INVIETRO SO CALLED INVIETRO FERTALIZATION AND THEN WERE IMPLANTED INTO OUR MOTHER AND BECAME US AND SO UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS OF HOW THE EGCELL AND THE SPERM CELL CAME TO BE IS REALLY THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING HOW THAT FERTILIZATION PROCESS CAME TO BE I KNOW EVERY ONE'S THINK I KNOW HOW FERTALIZATION OCCURS IT OCCURS THROUGH SEXTUAL INTERCOURSE AND SO ON AND WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT BUT I PROMISE YOU THAT IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND TO DAYS CONVERSATION CAN BEST BE THOUGHT OF AS A BIOLOGICAL CYCLE THAT OCCURS INFEMALES THAT ALLOWS THE POTENTIAL FOR FERTILIZATION BY THE SPERM BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT IS AND IT'S A BEAUTIFULLY ORCHESTRATED PROCESS THAT ILL DESCRIBE TO YOU AND I SHOULD SAY ALL PEOPLE MALES INFEMALES SHOULD REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW THE MENSTRUAL CYCHAL WORKS HOW IT IMPACTS FERTILIZATION BUT ALSO HOW IT IMPACTS THE BRAIN AND BODY BEHAVIOUR CSYCHOLOGY ET CETERA AND WEILLALSO TALK ABOUT SPERMATAGENESIS HOW SPERM CELLS COME TO BE AND HOW THEY ARRIVE THAT IS HOW THEY SWIN TO THE EGG AND THE INCREDIBLE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE BIOLOGY OF THE SPERM AND THE BIOLOGY OF THE EGG LEADS TO THIS INCREDIBLE THING THAT WE CALL EMBRYOGENESIS AND THE BIRTH OF THE CHILD AND OF COURSE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT CHILD INTO AND INFANT A TODLER AND ATOLESCEN A TEEN AND AN ADULT TO DAY'S DISCUSSION AGAIN IS NOT JUST FOR THOSE OF YOU SET ARE SEEKING TO HAVE CHILDREN ND I SAY THAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DATA YOU LOOK AT THE LITERATURE ON LONGEVITY AND VITALITY TO THEMES IN BIOLOGY THAT OFTENTIMES PEOPLE LUMP TOGETHER BUT AREN'T ALWAYS THE SAME FOR INCENSE THERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO INCREASE OUR VITALITY THAT ACTHICAN HARM ARE LONGEVITY BUT THERE ORE A SUBSET OF BIOLOGICAL RULES AND MECHANISMS THAT WHEN A LINED ALLOW US TO MAXIMIZE BOTH OUR VITALITY AND OUR LONGEVITY AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT ALL OF THOSE MECHANISMS AND TOOLS ARE HOWSED IN THE DISCUSSION AROUND MAXIMIZING FERTILITY AND THAT'S TROUE WHETHER NOT YOUR MALE OR FEMALE IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU WANT CHILDREN OR IF YOU DON'T IF YOU ALREADY HAVE CHILDREN OR IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTANDING HOW FERTILITY AND FERTILIZATION OCCURS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY WILL ALLOW YOU TO MAXIMIZE YOUR VITALITY AND LONGEVITY AND OF COURSE TO DAY'S DISCUSSION WILL PROVIDE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE BIOLOGY AND MANY ACTIONABLE TOOLS THAT WILL ALSO HELP YOU CONCEIVE CHILDREN IF THAT'S YOUR WISH SO OF COURSE AS IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS PODCAST WE WILL DISCUSS SCIENCE BASED TOOLS INCLUDING BEHAVIORAL TOOLS BOTH THE DUES AND THE DON'TS AND WE WILL DISCUSS NUTRITION BASE TOOLS AND SUPPLEMENTATION BASE TOOLS AND SOME OTHER PRACTICES INCLUDING THINGS LIKE ACCUPUNCTUR WHICH HAVE QUITE GOOD DATA TO SUPPORT THEM IN TERMS OF IMPROVING FERTILITY AND WE WILL DISCUSS WHY THOSE CERTAIN PRACTICES CAN WORK AND WE WILL DISCUSS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT YOUR DOCTOR CAN PRESCRIBE TO YOU IF FOR INSTANCE YOU HAVE A DEPISITE THAT AT THE LEVEL OF HORMON PRODUCTION OR NEV TRANSMITTOR PRODUCTION AT THE LEVEL OF THE BRAIN OR THE POTUITARY GLAND 'LL EXPLAIN WHAT ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE SOON OR THE GONADS THE OVERY AND THE TASTIES IN FEMALES A MALES RESPECTIVELY AGAIND BY THE ENDITAS EPISODE YOU WILL HAVE A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE AND ACTIONABLE TOOLS RELATED TO MAXIMIZING FERTILITY AND YOU WILL HAVE A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE AND ACTIONABLE TOOLS RELATED TO MAXIMIZING VITALITY AND LONGEVITY BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE AT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATEFOM MY TEACHING AN RESEARCH ROLLS IT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRON EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTOC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TODAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR NOW SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLITES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLITE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPISITES IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCES ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACTOLECTROLITE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT ONE GRAHAM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDER MILEGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'VE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT ELEMENT DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN LET'S TALK ABOUT FERTILITY AND IN DOING SO LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK FROM THIS WORD FERTILITY AND ASK WHAT IS FERTILITY AND FERTILIZATION REALLY ALL ABOUT THE OBVIOUS ANSWER IS THAT IT'S ABOUT POT UCING OFFSPRING BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S ABOUT PRODUCING OFFSPRING THAT CONTAIN THE GENETIC COMPONENTS OF BOTH PARENTS AND INDEED CONTAIN THE HALF OF THE GENES FROM ONE PARENT AND HALF OF THE GENES FROM ANOTHER PARENT NOW THEIRE TWO GENERAL TYPES OF CELLS IN THE BODY THE MOST COMMON TYPES OF CELLS IN THE BODY ARE CALLED SOMATIC CELLS THIS WOULD BE ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY EXCEPT THE EGG IN FEMALES AND THE SPERM AN MALS THE EGG IN FEMALES AND THE SPERM MALES ARE PART OF WHAT'S CALLED THE GERM LINE AND AGAIN HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH INFECTION IT'S JUST THAT THE CELLS OF THE GERM LINE HAVE GENES THAT CANNOT BE MODIFIED BY THE BEHAVIOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL THAT HOUSES THOSE GENES WHAT O I MEAN BY THAT WELL IF I WERE TO TELL YOU THAT BY EXERCISING YOU CAN IMPROVE MYNA CONDUAL FUNCTION YOU CAN CHANGE HORMONES A BY REDUCING STRESS YOU CAN PRODUCE CORTESALL BY U HITTING PUBERTY FOR INSTANCE A YOU WILL HAVE THE ASSECRETION OF HORMONES THAT THEN CHANGE SHENE EXPRESSION AN OTHER CELLS LEADING TO DEVELOPMENT OF BODY HAIR FACIAL HAIR DEEPENING THE VOICE BRESTGROWTH ET CETERA YOU'D SAY OKE GREAT NOW THAT ALL MAKES PERFECT SENSE BUT THAT'S ALL OCCURRING IN THE SO CALLED SOMATIC CELLS THE GERM CELLS ARE THE GERM LINE CELLS THAT IS THE EGG IN THE SPERM ARE A VERY UNIQUE AND PROTECTED SET OF CELLS THAT ARE GENERATED IN A PARTICULAR WAY AND WHOSE GENETIC COMPONENTS ARE NOT MODIFIABLE BY EXPERIENTS AND WHEN YOU TAKE A STEP BACK YOU THING ABOUT YOUSAY OH THAT'S RIGHT THERE'S NO REASON TO THING THAT EXERCISING WILL MAKE THE GHILDREN THAT YOU HAVE NOT YET HAD STRONGER AN INS OF COURSE NOT WHET WHY IS THAT WELL THAT'S BECAUSE THERE IS A BARRIER BETWEEN THE GENES OF THE GERM LINE CELLS AND BEHAVIORS THE CANNOT BE MODIFIED BY BEHAVIORS AND THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT YOU DO IN YOUR LIFETIME NOW I SUPPOSE THERE'S AN EXCEPTION IN THE NEGATIVE DIRECTION AND WHAN I'M REFERRING TO HER IS IF YOU WERE TO SAY BE EXPOSED TO A CHEMICAL THAT COULD MUTATE THE DIANE OF YOUR EGG OR SPRM OR IF YOU WERE TO FERTILIZE AND EMBRYO AT A IN A CERTAIN WAY AT A CERTAIN STAGE OF LIFE THAT IT GOT AN EXTRA CROMOZOME FOR INSTANCE WILL TALK ABOUT THIS ELOMIT LATER WELL THEN OF COURSE YOU COULD END UP WITH OFFSPRING THAT HAVE MODIFIED D'ANE THAT DON'T FAITHFULLY REPRESENT HALF OF THE GENES FROM MAM AND HALF OF THE GENES FROM DAD BUT THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS SPECIFIC BEHAVIORS MODIFYING THE GENES OF THOSE CELLS THE SPERM IN THE EGG CELLS IN A WAY THAT IMPROVES THE OFFSPRING SO THE KEY FIRST THING TO UNDERSTAND TODAY IS THAT THERE'S A DISTINCTION BETWEEN SOMATIC CELLS WHICH IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF CELLS IN YOUR BODYI G THE SO CALED GERM LINE CELLS WHICH ARE THE EGG IN THE SPERM THE EGG IN THE SPERM ARE THESE HIGHLY PROTECTED POPULATIONS OF CELLS THAT IN FEMALES ACTUALLY COME TO BE GURING EMBREO GENESIS CASE SO FOR ALL FEMALES OUT THERE YOU GENERATE WHAT TODAAMINA REFER TO AS A VAULT OF CELLS YOU HAVE A VAULT OF OF EGGS THAT ARE YOUR GERM LINE THOSE EGGS ALL CONTAIN ALL THE CROMAS OMES OF YOUR D ANE SO IT'S GOING TO BE AS MOST OF YOU KNOW THERE R TWENTY THREE CROMAZOMES AND CROMAZOMES A GONSIST IN PAIRS SO THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS AS EACH PAIR IS ONE STRAND AND YOU AVE TWENTY TWO SO CALLED OTOZOMES AND THENYOU HAVE ONE SEX CROMAZONE THE SEX CROMAZON WILL BEITHER EX OR WHY SO IN A FEMALE THEY HAVE TWO EX CROMAZOMEZO IN EACH ONE OF THE EGGS THAT A WOMAN HAS AND THAT SHE'S HAD SINCE SHE WAS AN EMBRYO AND THAT'S CONTAINED IN THIS VAULT THOSE EGGS ARE OF COURSE GOING TO BE VERY IMMATURE AT BIRTH RIGHT SHE HASNAT UNDERGONE PUBERIT YET AND CERTAINLY AS AN EMBRYO SHE HASNAN UNDERGONE PUBERITY AND THOSE CELLS ARE GOING TO CONTAIN TWENTY THREE PAIRS OF CROMAZOMES IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TWENTY THRE PAIRS OF CROMAZOMES THE CROMAZOMES ARE ESCENTIALLY THE WRAPPED UP D N E THAT CONTAINS ALL THE GENETIC INFORMATION TO CREAT ANY CELL TYPE IN THE BODY AND ACTUALLY TO CREATE AN ENTIRELY NEW INDIVIDUAL NOW THERE TWENTY THREE PAIRS OF CROMAZOMES TWENTY TWO OF WHICH ARE CALLED ATTOZOMES OC F THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE U JUST REMEMBER OTTOZOME OKEY THERE'S TWENTY TWO OF THEM AND THEN THERE'S ONE SO CALLED SEX CROMAZOME THE SEX CROMAZOMAZ ARE EITHER EX OR WHY BUT THIS IS A FEMALE SO SHE'S CAN HAVE TWENTY THREE PAIRS OF CROMAZOMES AND SHE CAN HAVE TWO EX CROMAZOMES FOR THE SEX CROMAZOMES C IF THIS IS ALREADY CONFUSING TO YOU DON'T WORRY I'LL MAKE IT VERY CLEAR HOW THIS ALL RELATES TO FERTILITY AND HOW IT RELATES TO CROMAZOMA EGGREGATION AND A BUNCH OF THINGS THAT I THINK THAY BE VE HEARD OF AND THAT PERHAPS A WERE OPAQUE TO YOU BUT I PROMISE TO MAKE THEM CLEAR BUT JUST UNDERSTAND THAT WITHIN EA CH OF THOSE EGGS THEY AVE TWENTY THREE PAIRS OF CROMAZOMES AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT LIKE NOMING CLATIER I'LL TELL YOU THAT THOSE CELLS ARE CONSIDERED DIPLOID THEY'RE ALLED THE DIPLOID AND THAT MEANS THAT THEY HAVE TWENTY THREE PAIRS OF CROMAZOMES AS DISTINGUISH FROMACELLS THAT ARE HAP LOID WHERE THERE'S ONLY ONE SET OF THOSE TWENTY THREE CROMAZOME SO AND STAVE TWENTY THREE PAIRS THERE'S ONLY TWENTY THREE CROMAZONES WILL WILL COME BACK TO HAPLOID CELLS ALOE IT LATER O K SO WHEN A FEMALE IS BORN SHE HAS ALL THESE EGGS IN THE RESERVE IN THIS VAULT THAT SHA'LL HAVE FOR HER ENTIRE LIFE SHE'S NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY MORE BUT THEY ARE VERY VERY IMMATURE SO WHEN A WOMAN IS IN EMBRYO GENIZIS SHE DEVELOPS THESE VERY IMMATURE EGGS OC TO DAY WE'RE ALSO GON N TALK ABOUT FOLICALS AND AND WE WILL BE CAREFUL TO DISTINGUISH FOLICALS FROM EGGS THE'RE OFTEN TALKED ABOUT INTERCHANGEABLY ON LINE AND ELSEWHERE AND EVEN BY FERTILITY DOCAND OL BE GIWYENS BUT WILL RANOW WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE EGG CELLS OC THE EGGS THEMCELVES WHICH ARE CELLS NOW THE GOAL OF FERTILIZATION IS TO BRING THAT EGG CELL INTO CLOSE ENOUGH PROXIMITY THAT IT CAN BE FERTILIZE BY A SINGLE SPRERMACELL AND THAT PERMCELL WEILL BRING TWENTY THREE CROMAZOMES AS WELL THAT INCLUDE JUST AS IN THE FEMALE EGG IT 'LL HAVE TWENTY TWO ATTOZOMES AND ONE SEX CROMAZOME AND IN THE MALE THAT SEX CROMAZOME CAN EITHER BE AN EX CROMAZOME WHICH THEN WOULD GIVE RISE TO FEMALE OFFSPRING OR E A WY CROMAZOME WHICH WOULD GIVE RISE TO MALE OFFSPRING AND TO DAY WE'RE NOT TALKIN ABOUT SEXUAL DINFERENTIATION THT'S A TOPIC OF A PREVIOUS AND YET ANOTHER FUTURE EPISODE BUT JUST TO GIV YOU A SENSE OF HOW EX CROMAZOMES AND WY CROMAZOMES CAN ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THAT SEXUAL DEFERENTIATION BOTH OF BODY AND BRAIN I'LL JUST MENTION IN TWO SENTENCES THAT FOR INSTANCE IF THERE'S A WY CROMAZOME AS OPPOSE TO AN EXT CROMAZOME THAT WY CROMAZOME CONTAINS GENES THAT SUPPRESS FOR INSTANCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF FEMALE GENITALIA AND THEREBY GIVE RISE TO MALE GENITALIA SO RATHER THAN THE FORMATION OF CLITERUS IS THE FORMATION OF A PENIS AND RATHER THE FORMATION OF OVERIS THE FORMATION OF A TESTIES OKE SO THAT'S MORE DIRECTED TOWARDS SEXUAL DEFERENTIATION WERE NOT GOING TO GET INTO THAT RIGHT NOW WI'LL GET INTO THAT IN A FUTURE EPISODE BUT EVEN IF YOU'RE ONLY TRACKING ABOUT TEN PER CENT OF WHAT I'M SAYING RIGHT NOW I PROMISE YOU'RE DOING GREAT IF YOU'RE TRACKING MORE THAN TEN PER CENT WELL THEN YOU'RE OING TERRIFICALLY WELL BECAUSE THE ESSENCE OF FERTILITY IN FERTILIZATION IS TO BRING TOGETHER THAT HALP LOID CELL THAT IS THE SPERM THAT ONLY HAS TWENTY THREE CROMAZOMES BUT NOT PAIRS OF CROMZOMES RIGHT CASAT'S THE DIANE FROM DAD TOGETHER WITH THE EGG WHICH AS I TOLD YOU ALREADY HAS TWENTY THREE PAIRS OF CROMAZOMES SO PART OF THE FERTILIZATION PROCESS HAS TO BE TO GET RID OF ONE HALF OF THOSE TWENTY THREE PAIRS IN THE FEMALE ATD TO GET RID OF IT AND YOU HAVE TO GET THE EGG IN THE SPERM IN PROXIMITY SO THAT THE EGG CAN POTENTIALLY BE FERTILIZED BY THE SPERM BRINGING THE DIANE THE TWENTY THREE SINGLE STRANDS F CROMAZOMES FROM DAD INTO A CELL THAT HAS TWENTY THREE SINGLE STRANDS FROM MOM OKE SO IIREALIZE I'NM PROLY BEING A LITTLE BIT REPETITIVE HERE BUT I WANT EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND THIS CAUSE IT REALLY FRAMES UP FERTILITY AND REPRODUCTION IND THE PROPER WAY WE'VE GOT A SELL FROM MOM THE EGG WHICH HAS TWENTY THREE PAIRS OF CROMAZOMES WE NEED TO GET RID OF ONE SET OF THOSE PAIRS SO THAT THERE'S ONLY TWENTY THREE CROMAZOMES WE NEED GET RID OF HALF OF THOSE CROMAZOMES AND THEN WE NEED TO BRING THAT CELL TOGETHER PHYSICALLY WITH THE SPERM CELL THAT CONTAINS THE TWENTY THREE CROMAZOMO STRANDS FROM DAD AND WE NEED TO BRING THOSE TOGETHER SO THAT YOU GET TWENTY THREE CROMAZOMO PARS FROM DAD AND TWENTY THREE CROMAZOMO PAIRS FROM MOM AND IN DOING SO YOU CREATE A CELL WHICH THEN BECOMES MULTIBLE CELLS THAT'S GOING TO BE THE DEVELOPING EMBRYO THAT HAS HALF THE GENES FROMOM AND HALF THE GENES FROM DAD SO I HOPE THAT'S CLEAR THAT IS THE BIOLOGICAL LOGIC WHICH I REALIZE AS A BIT OF A TONGUE TWISTER BUT A FORGIVE ME IT IS THE A MOST ACCURATE WAY TO DESCRIBE THIS PROCESS WE'RE TRYING TO BRING TOGETHER THE TWENTY THREE SINGLE STRANDS OF CROMOZOMES FROM DAD AND THE TWENTY THREE SINGLE STRANDS OF CROMAZOMES FROM MOM INTO THE SAME CELL NOW THAT REQUIRES A LITERAL F YSICAL CONTACT AND PARRING OF THE TWO CELLS BUT AS I MENTIONE BEFORE ALL THESE EGGS IN MAM ARE SITTING IN A VAULT AND THEIR VERYR VERY IMMATURE SO THE OBULATORY CYCLE IN THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE A REALLY ABOUT FIRST ELIMINATING HALF OF THE CHROMOZOMA PAIRS IN THAT TWENTY THREE SETS OF CHROMOZOMES AND NOT GETTING RID OF FOR INSTANCE HALF YOU KNOW JUST GOING ONE TO AH YOU KNOW ONE TO ELEVIN OR AND THEN OR TWELVE TO TWENTY THREE THAT'S NOT THE GOAL THE GOAL IS TO HAVE CHROMOZOMES ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX ALL THE WAY UP TO TWENTY THREE BUT ONLY TO HAVE HALF OF THE CROMOZOMES THERE AND TO BRING THAT SELL TOGETHER WITH THE SPERM CELL PHYSICALLY THEN ALLOW THEM TO FUSE AND ALLOW THE CHROMOZOMES FROM DAD IN THE CHROMOZOMES FROM MAM TO FUSE WITHIN A SINGLE CELL AND DUPLICATE INTO CELLS THAT CONTAIN HALF THE CHROMOZOMES FROM DAD AND HALF THE CHROMOZOMES FROM MOM THAT'S WHAT THE OBULATORY AND MENSTRUAL CYCLE ARE REALLY ALL ABOUT SO EN THINK ABOUT IT THAT WAY I'D LIKE TO JUST INITIATE THE DISCUSSION BY FOCUSSING FIRST ON THE FEMALE COMPONENT OR THE EGG COMPONENT OF FERTILITY AND FERTILIZATION AS I MENTIONE BEFORE A FEMALE HAS ALL THE EGGS I'LL BE IT VERY IMMATURE EGGS THAT SHE'S GOING TO HAVE AT THE TIME THAT SHE'S BORN NOW PUBERTY WILL HAPPEN AT SOME POINT AND WILL ALLOW THE OBULATORY IN THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE TO COMMENCE NOW ONE QUESTION THAT OU PERHAPS AR ASKING IS WHAT CONTROLS THE ONSET OF PUBERTY AND THERE THERE ARE NUMBER OF DIFFEREN RESULTS EACH OF WHICH COULD BE AN ENTIRE EPISODE OF A PODCAST ON ITS OWN BUT ARE JUST HIGHLIGHT A FEW THINGS THAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE ONSET OF MENSEES OR MENSTRATION OR IT SOMETIMES ALSO CALL THEMENARCHY RIGHT ONE THING THE GHO NOTS ABOUT TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS THAT IF YOU WERE TO TAKE ANY NUMBER OF YOUR NOTES ON LINE AND PUT THEM INTO O A SEARCH FUNCTION THAT YOU WOULD SEE A LOT OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGE USED FOR THE SAME THING SO FOR INSTANCE SOME PEOPLEL TALK ABOUT THE EGG IN THE PHOLICAL AS THE SAME THING EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NOT I'LL EXPLAIN THE IFFERENT SOON SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT MEN SEESE OR MENSTRATION OR MENARCHY IS THE EXACT SAME THING AND IN FACT THEY ARE NOT THE EXACT SAME THING BUT OFTENTIMES THESE A WORDS ARE USED INTERCHANGEABLY I'LL DO MY BEST TO DAY TO NOT OVERLOAD YOU WITH NOMINCLATURE BUT RATHER TO USE THE MOST COMMONLY USE TERMS FOR THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF FERTILITY AND FERTILIZATION BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE ONSET OF PUBERTY FIRST OF ALL MOST OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD THAT THE ON SEID OF PUBERTY IS HAPPENING MUCH EARLIER IN FEMALES NOW THAN IT WAS SOME YEARS AGO AND IN FACT THAT IS THE CASE AND I'LL TALK ABOUT SOME STATISTICS RELATED TO THIS ON WHICH ARE PRETTY STRIKING BUT DON'T NECESSARILY POINT TO ANYTHING DETRIMENTAL DOESN'T ESCERLY MEAN THAT SOMETHING BAD IS HAPPENING WHAT O WE KNOW FOR SHORE WHELL WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF SIGNALS THAT COME BOTH THROUGH THE BRAIN END THROUGH THE BODY AND MORE LIKELY BOTH IN ORDER TO CONTROL THE ONSET OF PUBERITY AND FEMALES A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES THE FIRST IS A MECHANISTIC ONE WE KNOW FOR INSTANCE THAT THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF THE OBULATORY AN MENSTRAL CYCLE IS INITIATED FROM THE BRAIN WERE GETTING GET INTO THIS ENLOTMORE DETAIL IN A FEW MINUTES BUT THERE'S A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HORMONS AND NURO TRANSMITTERS THAT ARE COMMUNICATED FROM THE BRAIN A STRUCTURE CALLED THE HYPOTHALMUS WHICH ROUGHLY SITS ABOVE THE ROUFOUR MOUTH AND THAT COMMUNICATES WITH A GLAND AN ENDECRANE OR HORMON RELEASING GLAND CALLEDTHE PETUITARY GLAN  THE PETUITARY GLAND LOOKS LIKE A A STALK A THAT ESSENTIALLY EXTENDS OUT OF THE BRAIN ITS ALSO LOCATED NOT FAR FROM A OUR THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH AND THAT HAS TWO SORT OF A SMALL MARBLE OR GREAT SIZE A A PROTUSIONS THAT THE ANTER PETUITARY IN THE POSTUR PETUITOR AND THEY RELEASE DIFFERENT HORMONES INTO THE BLOOD STREAM PUBERTY IS ENPART CONTROLLED BY THE FACT THAT UP IN TIL PUBERTY THERE ARE NURONS IN THE HYPOTHALMUS THAT RELEASE A NURO TRANSMITTARE CALLED GABA WHICH IS INHIBATORY AND THAT PREVENTS THE NURONS IN THE HYPOTHALMUS FROM RELEASING A VERY IMPORTANT HORMONE CALLED GANATATROPN RELEASING HORMONE OR G AND R AHT SO THE FIRST THING I REALLY LIKE EVERYONE TO KNOW AND COMMIT TO MEMORY TODAY IS VERY EASY G AND AR EIGHT STANDS FOR GANATATROPIN RELEASING HORMONE THIS COMES FROM THE BRAIN AND WILL COMMUNICATE TO THE PETUITARY TO RELEASE CERTAIN HORMONES PRIOR TO PUBERTY IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES THERE ARE NURONS IN THE BRIN THAT ARE ACTIVELY SUPPRESSING THE NURONS THAT RELEASE GAN OR AGE IT'S LIKE NO PUBERTY NO PUBERTY NO PUBERTY CAN'T HAVE PUBERTY CAN'T HAVE PUBERTY AND IN FACT THOSE CELLS ARE RELEASING THIS NUR TRANSMITTERE CALLED GABA BECAUSE ITS INHIBATORY PREVENTS THE FIRING OF THOSE NURONS IS SO PUBERTY IS ACTIVELEASE SUPPRESSED UP UNTIL CERTAIN POINT IT'S ALSO ACTIVELY SUPPRESSED AT LEAST IN SOME SPECIES HAND WE THINK AT LEAST PARTIALLY INUMENS BY THE TONIC RELEASE THAT MEANS THE ONGOING RELEASE AROUND THE CLOCK OF A ORMONE CALLED MELATONAN LATER IN LIFE IN FACT AFTER PUBERTY MELATONAN WILL BE SECRETED ONLY IN THE DARK PHASE OF EACH NIGHT AND AROUND THE TIME THAT ONE GOES TO SLEEP BUT IN CILDREN AND IN PARTICULAR IN CHILDREN PRIOR TO PUBERTY MELATONENT IS RELEASED MORE OR LESS CONSTANTLY NOW MELATONAN ISN'T THE ONLY SOURCE OF SUPPRESSION OF PUBERTY IT'S ALSO THESE NURL MECHANISMS INVOLVING GABA BUT IT IS CERTAINLY A GREAT CANDIDATE FOR ONE OF THE REASONS WHY PUBERTY DOESN'T GENERALLY TEND TO HAPPEN AT SAY GE FOUR GE FIVE TAT WOULD BE VERY UNUSUAL ANOTHER COMPONENT OF SUPPRESSION OF PUBERTY IS THAT TIPICALLY IN CHILDREN THEY HAVE RELATIVELY LOW BODY FAT STORES WISEST IMPORTANT WELL WE KNOW THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAN TRIGER THE ONSET OF PUBERTY IN PARTICULAR IN FEMALS IS THAT WHEN ENOUGH BODY FAT ACCUMULATES THAT BODY FAT RELEASES A HORMONE CALLED LEPTON AND THAT HORMON LEPTON TRAVELS IN THE BLOOD STREAM ACROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER AND GOES TO THE H POTHALEMAS AND CAN TRIGGER THE ONSET OF PUBERTY BY ACTIVATING THA NURANS THAT RELEASE CANATITROP IN RELEASING HORMON SO MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT PUBERTY IS HAPPENING EARLIER IN EARLIER IN FEMALES IS BECAUSE OF THE ACCUMULATION OF MORE BODY FAT AT YOUNGER AGES THAN WAS OBSERVED THIRTY OR FORTY AND CERTAINLY A HUNDRED YEARS AGO NOW I CAN ALREADY IMAGINE NUMBER PEOPLE ARE THINK OH THIS MUST RELATE TO THE OBCITY CRISIS AND INDEED THERE IS A CRISIS OF OB CITY OBESITY A IS SOMETHING THAT IS CAUSING ALL SORTS OF A PROBLEMS WITH PEOPLE'S HEALTH VARIOUS LEVELS BRAIN AND BODY AND THAT IS FAR MORE FREQUENT TO DAY THAN IT WAS EVEN TWENTY YEARS AGO SO IT IS INDEED A CRISIS BECAUSE IT HAS ENORMOUS DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS FOR SO MANY ASPECTS OF OF A BRAIN AN BODY HEALTH AND LONGEVITY BUT THIS WHOLE PROCESS OF THINKING ABOUT BODY FAT SIGNALLING LEPT INTO THE HYPE OF THALMAS IN THE ONSET OF PUBERTY DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO DO WITH THE OB S CRISIS IT MIGHT RELATE BUT IT COULD ALSO RELATE TO FOR INSTANCE IMPROVE NUTRITION WHICH IS ALLOWING BODY FAT STORES TO A CUMULATE MAY BE NOT TO THE LEVEL OF OBECITY BUT TO ACCUMULATE EARLIER AND AT YOUNGER AGES AN FEMALES WHICH IS THEN CAUSING EARLIER PUBERTY IN FEMALES TO JUST HIGHLIGHT HOW THAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE WHER I WANT TO REVIEW SOME DATA THE TALK ABOUT THE ONSET OF MENSEES MENSTRATION THAT IS PUBERTY IN FEMALES ACCORDING TO COUNTRY AND ACCORDING TO AGE OVER THE LAST HUNDRED OR MORE YEARS SO WHAT ARE THE GENERAL TRENDS IN TERMS OF THE ONSET OF PUBERTY AN FEMALES WELL THAT'S AN EASY ONE TO ANSWER OVER THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS OR SO THE ONSET OF PUBERTY HAS BEEN OCCURRING MUCH EARLIER WITH EACH PASSING DECADE IT'S REALLY AN INCREDIBLE SET OF STATISTICS A OUT I WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THESE DATAS SINCE I KNOW NUMBER OF YOUARE LISTENING AND NUCHIST A WATCHING ON UTOB A THIS IS FROM A STUDY IN WHICH THE ONSET OF PUBERTY HAS BEEN ANALYZED FROM AS EARLY AS THE EIGHTEEN FIFTIES RIT IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES THERE ARE DATE ON THAT OUT TO THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND ANOTHER COUNTRY STARTING AN ABOUT NINETEEN HUNDRED A EXTENDING OUT TO ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY THESE ARE ON GOING COLLECTIONS OF DATA BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE HOW THE DATE ARE FALLING OUT IN A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES JUST TO GIVE YOU A A FLAVOR BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU LISTENING AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WATCHING THE ESSENCE OF ALL OF THESE FINDINGS IS THAT PUBERTY IS HAPPENING MUCH MUCH EARLIER WITH EACH PASSING DECATE SO FOR INSTANCE IN THE UNITED STATES AROUND NINETEEN HUNDRED OR NINETEEN O THREE THE AVERAGE AGE OF MENARCEVE THE ONSET OF PUBERTY IN FEMALES WAS ABOUT FOURTEEN YEARS OLD WHEREAS IN NINETEEN NINETY THE AVERAGE AGE IS E LEVEN SO THAT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT A WE CAN SAY EXCELERATION OF THE ONSET OF PUBERTY NOW OF COURSE THESE ARE AVERAGES SO THERE WILL BE EXCEPTIONS THERE'S A DISTRIBUTION OF DATA TO DAY STILL THERE WILL BE A YOUNG FEMALES WHO WILL UNDERGO PUBERTY AT AGE ELEVEN OR TEN OR MAY BE TEN NINE AND OTHERS WHO WILL UNDERGO PUBERTY AT AGE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN MAYBE VEN SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEY HOWEVER IF WE LOOK AT FOR INSTANCE THE DATEA FROM NORWAY WHICH SDATES BACK A QUITE FAR THEY HAVE EXCELLENT RECORD K TO EIGHTEEN FIFTY WE SEE IS THAT THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE ONSET OF FEMALE PUBERTY IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY IN NORWAY WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD WHEREAS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY IT'S THIRTEEN YEARS OLD SIS A GERAMATIC ECCELERATION OF THE ONSET OF PUBERITY AND YOU SEE A SIMILAR TREND IN OTHER COUNTRIES AS WHILE SO IF WE WERE TO LOOK IN A FOR INSTANCE IN THE UKE ON THEY HAVE A A SMALLER DATA SET A MEANING IT ONLY EXTENDS BACK TO ABOUT NINETEEN FORTY BUT THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE ONSET OF PUBERTY IN THE UQE A IN NINETEEN FORTY WAS THIRTEEN AND HALF YEARS OLD AGAIN THIS IS JUST A FOR FEMALES AND IN NINETEEN SEVENTY IT WAS CLOSER TO THIRTEEN WITH A A TREN TORDS DECLINING EVEN FURTHER UNFORTUNATELY DIDN'T CONTINUE TO COLLECT DATA OUT TO A TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND AS A FINAL POINT IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT FOR INSTANCE IN A GERMANY AND FINLAND A THE AVERAGE A ONSET OF PUBERTY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY WAS SIXTEEN AND HALF YEARS OLD A BY NINETEEN FORTY WAS DOWN TO THIRTEEN AND A HALF YEARS OLD SO ALL OF THESE DATE I HAVE BORNE OUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN REGARDLESS OF LOCATION IN THE WORLD WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN YOU START TO THING ABOUT THE OB CITY CRISIS YOU STAABLE THAT'S MAINLY AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES BELIEVED OR NOT OR PERHAPS NOT SURPRISINGLY AND MAY BE THE HAS TO DO WITH THE OB CITY CRISIS AND YET I DON'T THINK WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT AT ALL SOMETHING IS HAPPENING HOWEVER IT COULD BE INCREASE BODY FAT STORIES DUE TO OVEREATING AN OB CITY HOWEVER IT COULD ALSO BE UNRELATED TO A B CITY IT COULD BE FOR INSTANCE IMPROVE NUTRITION AND THE AVAILAB AVAILABILITY OF QUALITY NUTRITION WHICH CAN SIGNAL THE MATURATION OF THE BRAIN AMBODY MECHANISMS THAT TRIGGER THE ONSET OF PUBERTY OBULATORY CYCHL AND MENSTRATION SO WE WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT LEAPING TO CONCLUSIONS ABOUT WHAT THESE TRENS MEAN BUT THE TRENS THEMSELVES ARE VERY VERY APPARENT AND AS A FINAL POINT I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BEHAVIORAL AND PCSYCHLO SOCIAL AS THE RE CALLED INTERACTIONS THAT CAN INFLUENCE PUBERTY AS WELL THIS HAS BEEN MOST STRIKINGLY OBSERVED IN ANIMALS AND SO I DON'T WANT ANY ONE TO BE ALARMED OR TO LEAP TO ANY GREAT CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE ONSET OF TIMING OF PUBERTY IN HUMANS BUT I BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT A CERTAIN RESULT WHICH SHOWS THAT IF A YOUNG FEMALE IS EXPOSED TO THE ODOR NOT O SERILY THE FAIRMONES OR THERE'S A DISTINCTION BETWEEN ODORS THAT WE PERCEIVE AND FAIRMONES WHICH ARE SUBCONSCIOUS RIGHT THE WE DON'T ACTIVELY PERCEIVE BUT THAT CAN IMPACT OUR BIOLOGY AND FAIRMON AFFECTS IN HUMANS ARE VERY CONTROVERSIAL BUT WE KNOW FOR INSTANCE THA IF YOU TAKE A FEMALE ANIMAL AND THEIR SOME EVIDENCE FROM HUMANS THAT IF YOU TAKE A YOUNG PRE PUBERTAL FEMALE AND YOU EXPOSED HER TO THE SENT OF A REPRODUCTIVELY COMPETENT MALE FOR SERIES OF DAYS BUT MAYBE EVEN AS SHORT AS A FEW HOURS AND SHE IS ALSO NOT REGULARLY BEING EXPOSED TO THE SCENT OF HER FATHER THAT SHE CAN UNDERGO PUBERITY EARLIER THAT'S RIGHT THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THE ODOR AND OR FERMONES OR PERHAPS SOMETHING ELSE THAT OCCURS WHEN A YOUNG PREPUBERITAL FEMALE IS IN THE HAS A FATHER THAT SHE'S IN REGULAR CONTECT WITH HE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO LIVE AT HOME BUT THAT IS AROUND A LOT THAT HER HIS SMELESCUWS ME IS REGISTERED BY HER BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS THAT I DON'T SAY PROTECTS BECAUSE IT KOND OF SCUSE THE THE VAILANCE OF THE CONVERSATION BUT THAT THAT OFF SETS OR BUFFERS THE OTHERWISE OBSERVED EFFECT WHICH IS THAT THE SCENT OF A REPRODUCTIVELY COMPETENT MALE IF ITS PRESENT OFTEN ENOUGH OR PERHAPS INTENSELY ENOUGH THAT IT CAN TRIGGER THE ONSET OF PUBERITY ING THAT FEMALE IN OTHER WORDS THE SCENT OF A OF A MALE THAT IS NOT THE FATHER AND WE THINK ALSO THAT IS NOT BIOLOGICALLY RELATED TO HER CAN TRIGGER EARLIER ONSET OF PUBERITY AND THAT EFFECT CAN AT LEAST BE PARTIALLY BUFFERED BY HER BEING IN THE PRESENCE OF THE SCENT FROM HER BIOLOGICAL FATHER NOW SOME OF YOU ARE PROBABLY ALREADY LEAPING TO CONCLUSIONS ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS YOU KNOW SHOULD YOU A NOT ALLOW YOUR DAUGHTER TO BE EXPOSED TO ANY MALES WHO ARE REPRODUCTIVE AGE ET CETERA AND THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT WHAT I'M SAYING THERE IS A HUGE NUMBER OF CONSIDERATIONS THAT THAT GOING TO THAT CALCULATION FOR EVERYBODY AND CIRCUMSTANCES ET CETERA BUT THE POINT IS THAT THE ODERS OF INDIVIDUALS BOTH RELATED IN PARTICULAR CLOSELY RELATED AND NON RELATED INDIVIDUALS CAN SHAPE THAT NORAL SYSTEMS AND THE HORMON SYSTEMS THAT CAN TRIGGER THE ONSET OF PUBERITY OF SUPPRESS THE ON SET OF PUBRITY SO WHETHER OR NOT OR TALKING ABOUT ONSET OF PUBERTY AT THIS AGE OR THAT AGE AND WHETHER OR NOT BIOLOGICALLY RELATED MALE OR NON BIOLOGICALLY RELATED MALE SENSE AROUND ET CETERA THE THING I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW IS THAT AT SOME POINT DURING DEVELOPMENT TYPICALLY NOWADAYS BETWEEN THE AGES OF ELEVEN AND FIFTEEN OR SO AGAIN THERE'S VERIABILITY THERE THE SUPPRESSION OF GANATITROPEN RELEASING HORMONE RELEASE FROM THE HYPOTHALEMIS IS REMOVED AND THEN CANATITROPEN RELEASING HORMON CAN ACTIVATE SELLS WITHIN THE PETUITARY AND IF YOU REALLY WANT TO NW ITS THE ANTER PETUITARY IN PARTICULAR AND THEN THE ANTER PETUITARY GLAND WHICH SITS AT AND KIND OF BRIDGES THE BRAIN AND THE BODY BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THE RELEASE OF HORMONES INTO THE BLOODSTREAM THAT ANTER PETUITARY IS GOING TO RELEASE TWO KEY HORMONES THAT EVERY ONE SHOULD KNOW THE NAME OF AND WHAT THEY DO AND WHEN I SAY EVERY ONE I MEAN MALES AND FEMALES NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THESE HORMONES BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN ACTIVE ROLL IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES AND OF COURSE YOU SHOULD WANT TO KNOW AND SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF EVERYONE ON THE PLANET IN MY OPINION BECAUSE IT TELLS YOU A LOT MORE ABOUT HUMANS THAN IF YOU JUST FOCUS ON YOUR OWN BIOLOGY BUT THOSE TWO HORMONES ARE CALLED LUTINIZING HORMONE WHICH IS ABBREVIATED L H AND FOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE WHICH IS ABBREVIATED FFIS E SO THAT THE SIMPLE PICTURE THAT YU NEED HAVE IN YOUR MIND IS GANADITROPE AND RELEASING HORMONE FROM THE BRAIN FROM THE HYPOTHELMAS IN PARTICULAR IS CAUSING THE RELEASE OF LUTINIZING HORMONE AN PHOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE G N R H STIMULATES L H LUTINIZING HORMON AND PHOLICAL TIMULATING HORMON EFFASE L H AND FAS H TRAVEL IN THE BLOOD AND CAN ACCESS ALL THE CELLS AND TISSUES OF THE BODY THIS ONE OF THE INCREDIBL THINGS ABOUT HORMONES IS THAT MANY HORMONES AND EL H AND EFAS  RE INCLUDED IN THIS CROUE CAN TRAVEL INTO CELLS AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THE GENETIC EXPRESSION OF THOSE CELLS THEY CAN CHANGE WHICH GENES ARE TURNED ON IN WHICH GENES ARE TURNED OFF AND THEY CAN ALSO ATTACH TO THE SURFACE OF THOSE CELLS AND MAKE THOSE CELLS TAKE ON DIFFERENT PROPERTY SO THEY CAN MATURE THOSE CELLS SO FOR INSTANCE  GOOD EXAMPLE THIS OUTSIDE OF THE CONTEXT WE BEEN TOCKING ABOUT IS THE HORMON TESTOSTRONE CAN TRAVEL TO THE HERFOLICAL AND CAN STIMULATE CHANGES IN THE GENES OF THE CELLS OF THE HERFOLICAL THAT CAN MAKE HEIRGRO A DIFFERENT HORMONE ESTROGEN CAN TRAVEL TO THE CELLS OF THE BREAST TISSUE AN ACT OF EIHT GEMES THAT CONTROL ENLARGEMENT OF THE CELLS OF THE BREAST TISSUE PROLACTIN A DIFFERENT HORMONE CAN TRAVEL TO THE MEMORY DUCKS AND CONTROL THE PRODUCTION IN THE SECRETION OF MILK AND IN MALES THAT CAN ACTUALLY HAPPEN IN CERTAIN CASES ALTHOUGH IT'S RARE BUT PROLACTIN CAN ALSO TRAVEL TO AREAS O THE BRAIN THAT CONTROL LEBIDO FOR INSTANCE AND I JUST AS SO YOU'LL NEVER FORGET IT MALES A ELEVATED LEVELS OF PROLACTIN OR ACTUALLY WHAT SET THE REFRACTORY PERIOD AFTER EJACULATION AND PREVENT ERECTION FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME SO YOU'LL NEVER FORGET PROLACTON UM THE POINT BEING THAT DIFFERENT HORMONES HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON DIFFERENT CELLS DEPENDING ON WHAT CELLS THOSE ARE RIGHT ESTROGEN OR ESTRADALES GOING HAVE DIFFENT EFFECTS ON THE BREAST TISSUE THAN IT WOULD ON SKIN ALTHOUGH HAS EFFECTS ON BOTH SIMILARLY WHEN L H AND FFAS E LUTINIZING HORMON AND POLICAL STIMULATING HORMON TRAVEL IN THE BLOOD TO THE GONAD AND THE GONAD IS AN OVERY IT WILL HAVE A CERTAIN SET OF CONSEQUENCES AND WHEN LUTINIZING HORMONE AND FOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE TRAVEL IN THE BLOOD TO A GONAD AND THAT GONAD HAPPENS TO BE A TESTY THEN IT WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT SET OF BIOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS SO LET'S FOCUS NOW ON WHAT HAPPENS WHEN L H AND FFAS EH ARRIVE AT THE OVERY AND LET'S US SUM NOW THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A FEMALE WHO HIS ALREADY UNDERGONE PUBERITY OR PERHAPS WE COULD EVEN FRAME THIS IN THE CONTECT OF A FEMALE WHO IS ABOUT TO UNDERGO PUBERTY FFISGEAN L E ARE NOW ABLE TO BE RELEASED BECAUSE SHE'S UNDERGOING PUBERITY BUT THE SAME SET OF PROCESSES ESSENTIALLY WOULD OCCUR FOR ANY POINT FROM PUBEITY ONWARD UNTILL MANAPAUS WHICH IS THE DEPLETION OF THAT VAULT THAT OVERIAN RESERVE OF ALL THOSE IMATURE EGGS I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLET IC GRENS NOW CALLED A G ONE IS A VITEMIN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSERING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLTIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DEGG IS THAT IT GETS TO BE THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GOD IS VERY IMPORTANT ITS POPULATED BY GUP MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE IMUN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIOTICS ENATHLETI GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLETIC GRENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTEGINS VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL F MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTE RIGHPT IF YOU LIKE TO TRIATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD IN THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEARS SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THRE K TOO AGAIND THAT'S ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CAM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEARS SUPPLY O VITEMIND THREE K TO O CASE THAT WE'RE NOW GOING TO TALK ABOUT OBULATION IN MENSTRATION AND LET'S JUST REMEMBER WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT THIS IS ALL ABOUT CREATING THE POTENTIAL FOR AN EGG TO BE FERTILIZED AND THAT EGG NEEDS TO HAVE HALF OF THE CROMOZOMAL PAIR O NO PAIRS BUT IT'S GOT HAVE TWENTY THREE CROMOZOMES JUST FROM MOM AND WE NEED TO POSITION THAT EGG SO THAT THE EGG CAN BE MET BY THE SPERM AND THAT SPERM CAN PENETRATE THAT EGG AND DONATE IT'S TWENTY THREE INDIVIDUAL STRANDS OF CROMOZOMES TO THAT EGG SO TAT YO CAN BRING TOGETHER THE DEONA OF DAD AND THE DEONA OF MONG SO THE OVATORY MENSTRUAL CYCLE OCCURS WHEND LUTINIZING HORMONE AND PHOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE HAVE BEEN RELEASED AND THE OBULATORY SLASH MENSTRUAL CYCLE AN HERE I HAVE TO CAN A PICK WHAT I WANT TO CALL IT A I GESS TO BE REALLY ACCURATE WE WOULD JUST CALL IT THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE CYCLE BUT THAT INCLUDES UNDERNEATH IT WITH THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE IS IT SOMETIMES CALLED IN THE OBULATORY CYCLE SO YOU DECIDE I'M GOING TO INTERCHANGEABLY TISCUSS THE OBULATORY CYCLE AN THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE THE PROMISE WHEN YOU SEEM MENSTRATION PEOPLE OFTEN THINK ABOUT JUST THE PERIOD THE SHEDDING OF THE UTERAN LINING WHEN FERTILIZATION HAS NOT OCCURRED SO IF I START SAYING OBULATORY CYCLE JUST KEEP IN MINE UNREFERRING TO THE ENTIRE THING NOW THIS IS PROBLY ALSO GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THAT IF YOU HEARD THAT THE OBULATORY CLASH MENSTRUAL CYCLE IS TWENTY EIGHT DAYS LONG THAT'S TRUE IN SOME CASES BUT THAT'S NOT ALWAYS TRUE IT'S ON AVERAGE TWENTY EIGHT DAYS LONG THERE ARE SOME FEMALES FOR WHICH THE OBULATORY CYCLE WILL BE SHORTER CAN BE AS SHORT AS TWENTY ONE DAYS AND OTHER FEMALES FOR WHICH IT WILL BE THIRTY FIVE DAYS LONG SHORTER THAN TWENTY ONE DAYS IND LONGER THAN THIRTY FIVE DAYS IS RARE ALTHOUGH IT DOES OCCUR ONE OF THE KEYTHINGS WHE THING ABOUT FERTILITY IS A UTALK TO OB G WYENDS WO R FOCUST ON FERTILITY WHICH I HAVE IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS EPISODE THE'LL TELL YOU THAT WHETHER NOT YOUR CYCLE IS TWENTY ONE DAYS LONG OR THIRTY FIVE DAYS LONG IS NOT AS MUCH OF AN ISSUE NECESSARILY UNLESS IT'S HAPPENING TO BE COMMUCH SHORTER OR MUCH LONGER IN A KIND OF ERATIC WAY SO IF YOURE SOMEBODY WHOSE CONSISTENTLY HAD TWENTY THREE DAY LONG CYCLES AND ALL THE SEN OUR HAVING THIRTY DAY LONG CYCLES THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY AN INDICATION OF ANYTHING BAD BUT IF IT'S TWENTY ONE DAYS ONE MONTH AND ITS THIRTY DAYS THE NEXT MONTH AND THAT SEVENTEEN DAYS THE NEXT MONTH RER EVEN IF IT'S ALWAYS FALLING WITHIN THAT TWENTY ONE TO THIRTY FIVE DAY LONG CYCLE BUT IT'S VERY VARIABLE FROM EACH MONTH OR EVERY OTHER MONTH OR SO YOU PROBABLY WANTAD CALK TO YOUR OBIG WY AN BECAUSE THAT COULD INDICATE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS WHICH THINGS COULD IT INDICATE WHILE THAT WILL BECOME CLEAR AS I SPELL OUT THE BIOLOGY IN A BIT MORE DETAIL BUT THIS IDEA THAT THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE OF THE TRYCYCLES ALWAYS TWENTY EIGHT DAYS THAT'S JUST FALSE THIS JUST NOT TRUE SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT THERE IS A COMMON MISCONCEPTION THAT BECAUSE THE AVERAGE MENSTRUAL CYCLE IS TWENTY EIGHT DAYS INDEED THE AVERAGE IS TWENTY EIGHT DAYS AND THE LUNAR CYCLE IS TWENTY EIGHT DAYS AND OF COURSE THERE IS REAL BIOLOGY TO SUPPORT THE FACT THAT THE LUNAR CYCLE CANT IN FACT IMPACT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IT DOES AND WILL TALK ABOUT LUNAR CYCLES IN A FUTURE EPISODE BUT THERE IS ZERO DATA TO SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND THE LUNAR CYCLE ARE LINKED IN ANY KIND OF CAUSAL WAY SARRY TO BREAK IT TO THE LUNAR CYCLE AND THE TITLE CYCLES AT THE OCIAN ARE DEFINITELY LINKED IN WAYS THAT ARE SUPERINTERESTING RELATE O THE TILT OF THE EARTH TAND THE PULL OF GRAVITY OF DIFFERENT PLANETS AND IT'S INCREDIBLE STORYAN TO ITSELF BUT THE LUNAR CYCLE IN THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE DESPITE HAVING SUM WEAK CORRELATION IN TERMS OF THEIR THEIR GEN THEIR DURATION THEIR SO CALL PERIODICITY NO PUN INTENDED WELL THERE'S NO CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP WHATSOEVER BETWEN THE LUNAR CYCLE IN THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE IF ANY OF YOU ARE AWARE OF ANY REAL DATA THAT CONFLICT WITH WHAT I JUST SAID PLEASE PUT THAT IN THE COMMON SECTION ON YOU TO BUT THIS IS PRETTY WELL ESTABLISHES AS FAR AS I KNOW O K SO WE NEED TO BRING TOGETHER THE SO CALLED HAPLOID CONTCONTENTS THE TWENTY THREE INDIVIDUAL STRANDS OF OF CROMOZOMES FROM THE EGG TO A PLACE IN A POSITION WHERE IT COL POTENTIALLY BE FERTILIZED BY THE MAIL SO WHAT HAPPENS LUTINIZING HORMONE AND FOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE TRAVEL TO THE OVERY THESE HORMONES ARE ABLE TO ACT ES THE OVERY THERE'S A LOT OF BLOOD SUPPLY TO THE OVERY AND EFIS H AN ELL AH ARRIVE AT THE OVERY THE OVERY HAS THIS VAULT THIS OVERIAN RESERVE OF IMMATURE CELLS THEY RESIDE WITHIN WHAT ARE CALLED FOLICLES THE FOLICLS ARE LITTLE SPHERICAL PACKAGES THAT CONPOTENTIALLY PROVIDE A NICE ENVIRONMENT FOR THOSE EGGS TO MATURE AND WHEN EFIS IAN PARTICULAR ARRIVES AT THE OVERY A SMALL NUMBER OF THOSE FOLICLS WILL SPLIT OFF FROM THE RESERVE THEY WILL EXIT THE VAULT AND THEY WILL UNDERGO MATURATION AND THE KEY PLAYER HERE IS FOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE AND THE FIRST FOURTEEN DAYS OF THE MENSTRUAL OBULATORY CYCLE IS REFERRED TO AS THE FALICULAR PHASE BECAUSE OF THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EFFISATES TRIGGERING THE MATURATION OF A SUBSET OF FOLICLES NOW TYPICALLY IN THE CONTECTS OF A TWENTY EIGHT DAY OR SO OBULATORY MENSTRUAL CYCLE DAY ONE IS DESIGNATED AS THE FERST SDAY OF THE PERIOD OF THE SHEDDING OF THE UTERAN LINING FROM THE PREVIOUS OBULATORY MENSTRUAL CYCLE IN WHICH FERTILIZATION DID NOT ACAR SO DAY ONE IS WHEN THE PERIOD INITIATES IT IS DAYS ONE THROUGH FOURTEEN APPROXIMATELY RIHT CAUS HEREWHIR IST CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF A TWENTY EIGHT DAY CYCLE BUT IT OULD BE LONGER COULD BE SHORTER BUT THE FIRST HALF OF THAT CYCLE IS THE SO CALL PILICULAR PHASE EFFISAGE HAS TRIGGERED THE DEPARTURE OF A SUBSET OF THESE FOLICALS THAT CONTAIN IMMATURE EGGS AND IT IS TRIGGERING THE MATURATION OF THOSE EGGS LUTINIZING HORMONE IS ALSO PRESENT BUT ALSO IT RELATIVELY LOW LEVELS AND IT'S DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THIS OBULATORY MENSTRUAL CYCLE THAT THE MAINGOAL IS TO GET THOSE FOLICALS TO MATURE SO INSIDE OF THOSE FOLICALS THE EGG IS DEVELOPING ITS GROWING IT'S MATURING AND IN DOING SO IT'S ALSO MAKING ITS OWN HORMONES THIS I THINK IS ONE OF THE MOST ELEGANT ASPECTS OF THE OVULATORY MENSTRUAL CYCLE THAT IN A FEW MINUTES YOU'LL LEARN ABOUT SOMETHING WHICH STILL TO THIS DAY EVEN THOUGHIVE KNOWN ABOUT THE STUFFORD FOR DECADES NOW BECAUSE OF MYTRAINING STILL DISBLOWS MY MIND THAT YOU HAVE US ONE HORMONE FOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE TRIGGERING THE MATURATION OF SOME EGGS INSIDE OF SOME FOLICALS AND THEN THOSE FOLICALS THEMSELVES MAKING ANOTHER HORMONE THAT FURTHERIS THE PROCESS AND THEN SOON AS YOU'LL LEARN CREATE A HORMONE TO TRIGGER THE SECOND HALF OF THE PROCESS JUST A BEAUTIFUL SYMPHONY OF EXPRESSION OF DIFFERENT GENES IN DIFFERENT HORMONES TO MAKE EVERYTHING WORK AS OPTIMALL AS POSSIPLE SO AS THESE DIFFERENT FOLICALS MATURE SOMEHOW AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW ONE OF THOSE FOLICLES CONTAINING AN EGG GET SELECTED IT'S EITHER BECAUSE IT MATURES THE FASTIST OR THERE SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT IS STILL NOT COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD THAT ALLOWS IT TO BE SELECTED AND ALL THE OTHER FOLICALS THAT ARE MATURING DEGENERATE AND DIE AND THEY'RE GONE THEY DON'T GO BACK INTO THE OVARIAN RESERVE THEY ARE NOW DEPLEDED FROM THAT BANK ACCOUNT THAT IS THE OVARIAN RESERVE THEY DIE OFF BUT THAT SINGLE EGG THAT KEEP IN MIND CONTAINS TWENTY THREE PAIRS OF CHROMOZONES OR WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN RID OF ONE HALF OF THOSE TWENTY THREE SETS OF CHROMOZONES YET BUT THAT ONE WILL CONTINUE TO MATURE AND THEN AT SOME POINT THAT EGG WILL S ARTTUNE UNDERGO A PROCESS IN WHICH THOSE CHROMOZOMES ARE PULLED APART BY LITTLE COMPONENTS WITHIN THE EGG CALLED SPINDLES THEY LEARLY HAVE A PHYSICAL PULLING OF THE CROMOZOMEOS APART SO NOW THOSE TWENTY THREE PAIRS ARE NO LONGER ATTACHED TO ONE ANOTHER AT THE MIDDLE LIKE THEY WERE BEFORE LIKE TWO BEADS OF OF STRINGS OR I SHOULD SAY TWENTY THREE SHORT STRANDS OF BEADS THAT WERE AT ONCE CONNECTED TO ONE ANOTHER NOW ARE PULLED APARTS THAT YOU HAVE TWENTY THREE CHROMOZOMES ON EACH SIDE BUT THER PULLED APART FROM ONE ANOTHER RIGHT SO THAT DIPLOID CELL IS NOW STARTING TO BECOME A CELL IN WHICH HALF OF THE CHROMOMOZOMES HALF OF THOSE TWENTY THREE PAIRS ARE PHYSICALLY PULLED AWAY FROM THE OTHERS AND THEN THE EGG AECTUALLY STARTS TO FORM ITS OWN WILL WE CALL INVOLUTION AF MEMBRANE AROUND THOSE TWENTY THREE PEIRS ONE SET OF THEM AND IN CAPSILATES THEM SO SORT OF GOT AN EGG WITH TWO PARTS WHERE THE TWO SETS OF CHROMOZOMES TWO SETS OF TWENTY THREE CHROMOZOMES ARE NOW SEPARATE FROM ONE ANOTHER INSIDE OF THE EGG AND THEN ONE OF THOSE ACTUALLY GETS EJECTED FROM THE EGG IND THE NAME OF THAT THING THAT GETS EJECTED ITS AR LIKE THE HOVEL POD AS HOW I IMAGINE IT A YOU KNOW FROM FROM STARWARDS YOU KNOWR FROM ANY KIND OF A SPACEODYSSY MOVY WHERE SOME THING IS READY TO HAPPEN IN A HOVEL POD SHOOTSOUDE OF THE SHIP WELL THAT TWENTY THREE PAIRS IS NOW EJECTED FROM THE EGG IT'S CALLED THE PULLAR BODY AND THAT'S GOING TO DEGENERATE IT'S GOING TO GO AWAY AND IN DOING SO TAKE IT THE EGG CELL WHICH WAS ONCE DIPLOID ADD TWENTY THREE PAIRS OF CROMOZOMES AND MAKING IT HAPLOID AND NOW WHAT YOU'VE GOT IN IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCES IS A BEAUTIFULLY PRESTINE EGG THAT WAS SELECTED FOR AND HAS TWENTY THREE SINGLE STRANDS OF CHROMOZOMES TWENTY TWO OTOZOMES IN ONE SEX CHROMOZOME THAT SEX CHROMOZOME IS GOING TO BE AN EX CROMOZOME ALMOST WITH CERTAINTY BECAUSE FEMALE MOTHER IS CREATING THAT EGG SO THEN THE EGG THAT CONTAINS JUST THE APPROPRIATE TWENTY THREE SINGLE STRAND CHROMOZOMES IS GOING TO FUSE WITH THE WALL OF THE OVERY AND THAT EGG WILL BE RELEASED AND WILL TRAVEL INTO THE PHILOPIAN TO NOW WE'LL GET BACK TO THAT EGG IN A FEW MOMENTS BUT THAT PROCESS WHICH REPRESENTS THE FIRST HALF OF THE OBULATORY MENSTRAL CYCLE AGAIN WAS TRIGGERED BY EFFIC AGENT TO SOME EXTENT LUTINIZING HORMONE BUT IT IS THE ON GOING MATURATION OF THAT EGG WHICH ALSO CAUSES THE PRODUCTION OF ESTROGEN WHICH ALLOWS THAT WHOLE PROCESS TO A CAR AND YOU COULD SAY WHY WELL THE ANSWER TO THE WY IS A VERY IMPORTANT BIOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE THAT WE ARE GOING TO RETURN TO N A NUMBER F DIFFERENT CONTECTS TO DAY BITH AS REFERENCE TO FEMALE END MALE FERTILITY AND THE PRINCIPLE IS A SO CALLED NEGATIVE FEED BACK SO WHEN ESTEROGEN IS PRESENT AT RELATIVELY LOW LEVELS AND FEMALES IN THE OVERY AS IT IS DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE EGGS SOME OF THAT ESTROGEN OF COURSE IS GOING TO EX AT THE OVERY IT'S GOING TO GO INTO THE BLOOD STREAM AND IT'S GOING TO TRAVEL BACK TO THE PETUITARY NOW TE PETUITARY CAN RELEASE THINGS LYKE PHOLICAL TIMULATING HORMON AND LUTNIZING HORMON BUT THE WAY I'D LIKELY TO THINK ABOUT THE PETUITARY FORSAKE OF FEED BACK LOOPS IS THAT IT'S SORT OF LIKE A THERMOMETER THAT YOU WOULD PUT INTO A POOL LIKE A BACKYARD POOL THAT IS ATTACHED TO THE HEATER AND FOR INSTANCE IF YOU WERE TO PUT A THERMOMETER IN TO A POOL THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO KEEP IT SEVENTY DEGREES AND THE TEMPERATURE OF THAT POOL IS SIXTY DEGREES WELL THEN THAT THERMOMETER OUGHT TO TRIGGER SOME SORT OF MECHANISM WEAR THE POOLWOULD HEAT UP UNTIL THE TEMPERATUE F THE POOL HIT SEVENTY DEGREES AND THEN IT SHOULD TRIGGER THAT THERMOMETER TO TURN OFF THE HEATING SYSTEM OOK AY THAT TO HAVE A NEGATIVE FEED BACK SYSTEM THAT WOULD KEEP THE TEMPERTURE MORE OR LESS CORRECT THAT'S A LOT OF THE WAY THAT THE SYSTEMS RELATED TO ESTROGEN AND ALSO TESTOSTRONE AND THESE DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE LUTINIZING HORMONAPHOLICAL TIMULATING HORMONE WORK IS WELL TIPICALLY WHEN THE LEVEL OF A HORMONE IS TO HIGH THEN IT SHUTS DOWN THE PRODUCTION OF TE HORMONES THAT WOULD TRIGGER FURTHER PRODUCTION OF THAT HORMON I KNOW THAT'S A MOUTHFUL TO LOT TO THINK ABOUT IN SOME OF YOUR POLY THING YOU WO I'M GETTING DIZZY NOW WITH BIOLOGY BUT I PROMISE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THIS IN FEMALES WHEN ESTROGEN IS RELATIVELY LOW BUT NOT ZERO BUT IS RELATIVELY LOW DURING THAT FIRST FALICULAR HALF OF THE OBULATORY CYCLE IT ACTUALLY TRIGGERS NEGATIVE FEE BACK ON ELATIENT EFFESATE SO THAT NOT TOO MUCH IS PRODUCED BUT THEN JUST PRIOR TO OPULATION THE LEVELS OF ESTROGEN AND THE LEVELS OF SOME OTHER HORMONES FROM THOSE EGGS RIGHT YOU HAVE THE EGGS PRODUCING ESTROGEN THEMSELVES GETS HIGH ENOUGH THAT IT ACTUALLY TRIGGERS A POSITIVE FEED BACK LOOP ON THE PETUITARYES OF THE PETUITARIES IS ESSENTIALLY OBSERVING THE AMOUNT OF ESTROGEN IN THE BLOODSTREAM PRODUCED BY THE OVER IT AND THE MOUNT OF ESTROGEN TOWARDS THE END OF THE SECOND HALF OF THE MENTRUAL CYCL HAS INCREASED AND TRIGGERS A POSITIVE FEE BACK LOOP IT TRIGGERS THE PETUITARY TO RELEASE MORE EFESATEEN ELL AGE AND THAT HELPS TRIGGER OBULATION OCA THAT DEPLOYMENT ARE THE RELEASE OF THAT ONE MATURE PROPER SELECTED EGG WITH THAT'S HAPLOID WITH THE TWENTY THREE INDIVIDUAL PAIRS OF CRORMOZONS INTO THE PHILOPIAN TO SCELESTIOUS BACK UP REALLY QUICKLY AND JUST OND OF SUMMERISE WHAT'S HAPPEN GANATATROPEN RELEASING HORMONE FROM THE HYPOTHALMUS TRIGGERS THE RELEASE OF PFOLICAL STIMULATING HORMON AND LUTINIZING HORMON THAT TRAVELS TO THE OVERY TRIGGERS THE RELEASE OF A SUBSET OF IMMATURE PFHOLICALS WITH IMMATURE EGGS THOSE IMMATURE FOLICALS AND IMATURE EGGS START TO MATURE START TO GROW BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF PHOLICAL STIMULATING HORMON THE GROWTH OF THOSE EGGS THEMSELVES INCREASES ESTROGEN AS THE ESTROGEN START TO ACCUMULATE IN THE ENVIRONMENT SOME OF THAT TRAVELS BACK TO THE PETUITARY AND WHEN LEVELS OF ESTROGEN ARRIVING AT THE PETUITARY ARE RELATIVELY LOW THE PETUITARY OU WE DON'T NEED TO RELEASE ANY MORE POLICAL TIMULATING ANDLUTINIZING HORMON HOWEVER IT SOME POINT JUST PRIOR TOPULATION ENOUGH ESTROGEN HAS BEEN PRODUCED BY THAT ONE SINGLE SELECTED MATURE EGG AND SOME OF THE OTHER POLICALS AROUND IT THAT WERE MATURING BUT THAN SINCE DIED OFF THAT THE ESTROGEN TRIGGERS A POSITIVE FEED BACCLUP THE PETUITARY SAYS OKE AND RELEASES MORPOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE AND LUTEINIZING HORMONE AND BAM THE EGG WHICH HAS THE PROPERGENETIC COMPONENTS SETS OFF OUT OF THE OVERY AND INTO THE PHILOPIAN TO SO CALLED OBULATION HAS BEGUN E THAT ITSELF WHAT I JUST DESCRIBE CONSTITUTES THE FIRST HALF OF THE OBULATORY MENSTRUAL CYCLE WHICH WE CALL THE FALICULAR PHASE AND ITS MARKED BY THE PRESENCE OF EFFISAGE EN SOME OTHER THINGS BUT WE CAN REALLY THINK ABOUT IT AS MARKED BY EFFISAGE FROM THE PETUATARY AND BY ESTROGEN OR ESTRODIAL MADE WITHIN THE OVERY OCA THEN COMES THE SECOND HALF OF THE OBULATORY MENSTRUAL CYCLE WHICH I PERSONALLY THINK IS ONE OF THE COOLEST MECHANISMS IN ALL BIOLOGY WHICH IS THAT REMEMBER THE PHOLICAL THAT HOUSED THAT ONE EGG THAT WAS THE SELECTED EGG THAT BECAME THE MATURE EGG AND THAT PHOLICAL WHICH NO LONGER CONTAINS THE EGG BECAUSE THE EGG TOOK OFF ANOBULATED IS CALLED THE CORPOUS LUDIUM ND THE CORPOUS LUDIUM STARTS MAKING THREE HORMONES WHICH INCLUDE ESTRODIAL THING CALLED INHIBBON BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT HORMONE THE ONE THAT REALLY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT IS THAT IT STARTS PRODUCING VERY HIGH LEVELS OF PROGESTERONE PROGESTERONE LEVELS START TO INCREASE A BOUT THE TIME OF OBULATION ALTHOUGH JUST PRIORTOBULATION AND OVER THE NEXT SECOND HALF OF THE OBULATORY CYCLE ABOUT FOURTEEN DAYS OF ITS A TWENTY EIGHT DAY CYCLE LO BET LONGER LIT SHORTER DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF CYCLE LEVELS OF PROGESTERONE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE OBULATORY CYCLE ARE GOING TO INCREASE BY FOURTEEN HUNDREDFOLD COMPARED TO WHAT THEY WERE IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE OBULATORY CYCLE SO AGAIN IF WE WERE TO CHARACTERIZE THE MENSTRUAL OBULATORY CYCLE WHICH IN BROAD STROKES WHAT WE WOULD SAY IS THAT EFFISAE AND ESTROGEN MARK THE INITIAL PART THE FIRST HALF SO CALLED PILICULAR PHASE AND THAT THE ESTROGEN AND EFFISAGE SECOND MOTION OBULATION AND THEY PRIME THE SYSTEM FOR THE PRODUCTION OF A CORPOUS LUDIUM WHICH PRODUCES PROGESTERONE AND THE SECOND HALF OF ALL THIS IS CALLED THE LUDIAL PHAES THE SECOND HALF OF THE OVATORY MENSTRUAL CYCLE IS THE LUDIOL PHASE BECAUSE OFE CORPOUS LUDIUM THIS OTHERWISE DISCARDED TISSUE THAT PRODUCES PROGESTERONE WHAT IS PROGESTERONE DUE WELL PROGESTERONE IMPACTS THE UTERAN LINING SO CALLED ENDOMETRIUM ORE THE LINING THE MUCUS LINING OF THE UTERUS WHERE THAT EGG THAT'S OVULATED IS POTENTIALLY GOING TO IMPLANT IF ITS FERTILIZED AND SO IN A KIND OF PERFECT WAY OR I SHOULD SAY IN A A SEEMINGLY PERFECT WAY THE EGG IS OFF ON ITS WAY IT MIGHT GET FERTILIZED THE REMNANTS OF THE COMPARTMENT THAT LET GO OF THAT EGG PRODUCE A HORMONE THAT THEN PREPARES THE ENDERMETUAL LINING OF THE UTERUS FOR THE POTENTIAL IMPLANTATION OF THAT EGG IT'S BASELY MAKING THE BEG FOR THE FERTILIZED EGG TO POTENTIALLY IMBED IN TO IMPLANT IN AND THEN ACHIEVE ALL THE NOURISHMENT THAT IT NEEDS TO GROW EVENTIALLY INTO A HEALTHY EMBRYO AND CHILD JUST AN AMAZING SET OF BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS IF YOU ASK ME BECAUSE WHAT YOUR OBSERVING HERE IS AN INCREDIBLE ECONOMY OF FUNCTION WHEREBY THE SAME CELLAR COMPONENTS THAT ARE PRODUCING THE EGG WELL SOME OF THEM ARE BEING DISCARDED BUT THERE NOT BEING DISCARDED WITHOUT PURPOSE THEIRE BEING DISCARDEN IN A WAY THAT TRIGGERS THE ONSET OF HORMONAL EXPRESSION THAT THEN PREPARES THE FERTILIZED EGG TO BE IN AN ENRICHED ENVIRONMENT ENWHICH IT CAN THROV I REALIZE THAT WAS A LOT OF DETAIL BUT WE HAVE A COUPLE OF KEY THEMES WE'VE GOT THE HYPOTHALMUS GIN OR AGE WE'VE GOT THE POTUITARY WITH ELAEAN EFFISAGE AND THOSE HORMONS TRAVEL TO THE OVERY THE OVERY HAS EGGS IN A VAULT BASELY IMMATUR EGGS IN AVAULT SOME OF THOSE ARE ACTIVATED BY THE PRESENCE OF EFFISAGEIAN ELLAGE EACH MONTH AND ONE OF THOSE EGGS WILL BE SELECTED AND WILL OVULATE THE REMNANTS OF THE PHOLICAL AND EGG THAT ARE NOT SELECTED THE CHROMOZOMES THAT YOU DON'T NEED ER DISAPPEAR IN THE POLAR BODY AND THE CORPOUS LUDIUM GIVE RIZE TO PROGESTERONE AND SETS EN MOTION THE SECOND HALF OF THE OATORY MENSTRUAL CYCLE WHICH IS THE LUDIO PHASE WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THE POTENTIAL FOR THAT FERTLIZED EGG TO IMBED IN A NICE NOURISHING ENVIRONMENT AND OF COURSE WE SHOULD ALL BE THINKING IF THE EGG IS FERTILIZED AND THEN IT LAYS DOWN IN THE A NICE COMPY UTERAN LINING THAT'S BEEN PREPARED BY A PROGESTERONE IN THE CORPOUS LUDIUM WELL THEN EVERYTHING'S FINE AND GOOD BUT WHAT IF FERTILIZATION DOESN'T OCCUR WEL WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IF FERTILIZATION DOESN'T OCCUR FERTILIZATION DOES NOT OCCUR FOR WHATEVER REASON THAT UTERE IN LINING IS GOING TO SHED AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT'S REFERRED TO AS THE PERIOD ITS THE ACTUAL REMOVAL OVER THE DEPARTURE RATHER OF THE THICKEND AN DEMETRIUM LINING OF THE UTERUS WHEN FERTILIZATION HAS NOT OCCURRED AND OF COURSE IF THAT HAPPENS WE NEED ANOTHER OBULATORY MENSTRUAL CYCLE SO HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN WELL THE HORMONE INHIBBON IS ALSO MADE BY THE CORPUS LUDIUM AND DOESN'T GO QUITE AS HIGH AS THE HORMON PROGESTRONE BUT AT KIND OF TRACTS THAT INCREASE IN PROGESTRONE THAT OCCURS IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE OVULATORY CYCLE BUT THEND IF FERTILISATION DOES NOT OCCUR INHIBBON LEVEL START TO DROP AND WHAT I HAVEN'T TOLD OU IS WHAT INHIBBON DOES INHIBBON IN CONCERT WITH OTHER HORMONES LIKE ESTROGEN FEED BACK TO THE HYPOTHALEMUS AND PREVENT THE FURTHER RELEASE OF PHOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE AND LUTINIZING HORMONE RIGHT IF YOU HAVE AN EGG THAT GETS FERTILIZED AND CAN INPLANT WELL THEN YOU DON'T WANT MORE EGGS TO MATURE RIGHT YOU WANT O HOLD ON TO THE ONES IN THE VAULT YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO MATURE AND HORMONS LIKE INHIBBON AND AGAIN WORKING WITH OTHER HORMONES ARE GOING TO PREVENT THE SECRETION OF THINGS LIKE EFFISAGEAN ELLAGE A TYPICALLY PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING PREGNANT EVERY MONTH IN FACT THATS NOT POSSIBLE IN PART THE REASON IT'S NOT POSSIBLE IS THAT IF THE FERTILIZE EG IN PLANTS THEIR NUMBER DIFFERENT HORMONE CASCADES THAT SHUT DOWN THE PRODUCTION OF THINGS LIKE GAN AR H EFFIASATION ELAH IN WAYS THAT PREVEND FERTHER MATURATION OF FOLICLES IN A FALICULAR PHASE BUT IN THE INSTANCE WHERE FERTILIZATION DOES INCUR AND MENSTRATION OCCURS AND I SHOULD MENTION THAT THE THE DURATION OF MENSTRATION THE ACTUAL BLEEDING TYPICALLY IS ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO FIVE DAYS THE QUOTIN  HEAVINESS THE LIGHTNESS OR HEAVINESS OF THAT BLEEDING WILL DEPEND ON YOU GUESSED IT THE AMOUNT OF PROGESTERONE THAT IS SECRETED FROM THE CORPUS LUDIUM THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY PLAERS THERE AND IF MENSTRATION OCCURS WELL THEN IN HIBBON LEVELS ALSO DROP PROGESTRONE LEVELS ALSO DROP AND WHEN THAT OCCURS THERE'S A POSITIVE FEED BACK SIGNAL UP AT THE LEVEL OF THE PATUITARY THE PATUITARY LITERALLY CAN REGISTER HOW MUCH IN HIBBON AND PROGESTERONE AND ESTROGEN IS PRESENT IN THE BLOOD STREAM AND IF THOSE LEVELS ARE SUFFICIENTLY LOW WELL THEN G IN OUR H GETS SECRETED AGAIN EFFASAGE GETS SECRETE AGAIN AN ELAH GET SECRETE AGAIN AND THE FIRST HALF THE FALICULAR PHASE OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE INITIATES ALL OVER AGAIN IT'S HARD TO OVERSTATE HOW BEAUTIFULLY ORCHESTRATED THIS ENTIRE SYSTEM IS THE NUMBER OF FEED BACLOOPS AND FEED FORWARD LOOPS I THINK IF YOU CAN JUST GENERALLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE FIRST HALF OF THE MENSTRUAL OBULATORY CYCLE IS MARKED BY THE IMATURATION THE PHOLICLS AN EFFASAGE AND THAT THE SECOND HALF IS MARKED BY THE ACCUMULATION OF PROGESTRONE AND THE THICKENING OF THE UTERAN LINING SHOULD FERTILIZATION IN IN PLANTATION OCCUR I THINK THAT YOU WILL CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE FEMALEBER OF PRODUCTIVE CYCLE BETTER THAN MOST PEOPLE OUT THERE IT WILL ALSO OF YOU UNDERSTAND A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE SOMETIMES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE CYCLE FOR INSTANCE THERE ARE DATA SHOWING THAT IN MANY NOT ALL BUT IN MANY WOMEN IN THE FOUR TO FIVE DAYS PRIOR TO OPULATION THERE IS A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN LIBITO THAT DRAMATIC INCREASE IN LIBIDO IS TRIGGER BY A NUMBER OF THINGS BUT SOME OF THOSE THINGS INCLUDE THE SPIKE IND EFFASAE THAT OCCURS THE SPIKE IN ELAH THAT OCCURS AND SOME ASSOCIATED INCREASES IN ANDROGENS THINGS LIKE D  G A AND TOSTOSTRONE WHICH JUST AS IN MALES CAN BE RELATED TO LIBIDO IN FEMALES TRIGGER LIBITO YOU CAN IMAGINE WHY THIS WOULD BE IN EFFECTIVE MECHANISM TO HAVE IN PLACE IN FEMALES IF THE GOAL AS IT WERE UM CERTAINLY OF THE EGG UM PERHAPS NOT OF THE THE WOMAN AS A WHOLE BUT IF THE GOAL IS TO FERTILIZE THE EGG SO INCREASES IN LEBIDO JUST PRIOR TO THE ON SET OF OBULATION THERE'S ALSO BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION AND INTEREST AND FRANKLY DATA EXPLORING THE MALLAYS THAT CAN OCCUR AT CERTAIN PORTIONS OF THE OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND THERE'S A LOT OF MISCONCEPTION ABOUT THIS A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE FOCUS ON THE MA LAYS THAT CAN OCCUR AROUND THE TIME OF BLEEDING BUT THERE ARE ACTUALLY STRONGER DATE O SUPPORT THE FACT THAT SOME AGAIN SOME NOT ALL WOMEN EXPERIENCE A KIND OF MALAYS SOMETIMES ASSOCIATE WITH ANXIETY SOMETIMES NOT THAT'S ASSOCIATE WITH THE MID TO SECOND HALF OF THE LUDIALPHASE OF THE OBULATORY MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND THAT DESPITE WHAT PEOPLE COMMONLY THINK IS NOT ASSOCIATE WITH ELEVATED LEVELS OF ESTROGEN IS ACTUALLY ASSOCIATE WITH THE DEPLETION IN ESTROGEN LEVELS THAT CAN OCCUR DURING CERTAIN PORTIONS OF THAT SECON HALF OF THE LUDIAL PHASE OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE SO A AGAIN THIS IS HIGHLY VARIABLE A YOU KNOW FOR SOME PEOPLE THEY MAY NOT EXPERIENCE ANY MALAYS AT ANY POINT DURING THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLE OTHER INDIVIDUALS ALSO FOR INS INCE MIG NOT EXPERIENCE ANY VARIATION IN THEIR LIBIDO AT ANY POINT DURING THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLE AGAIN HIGHLY VARIABLE AND YET THERE ARE SOME STATITICALLY SIGNIFICANT TRENDS THAT HAVE BEEN OBSERVE THAT TRACT O VERY SPECIFIC CORBONAL COMPONENTS WITHIN THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE AGAIN THIS WILL ALL BE VERY CONTEXTUAL AND OF COURSE THIS CAN PLAY OUT IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS SO FOR INSTANCE SOME WOMEN EXPERIENCE VERY HIGHTEND LEVELS OF SENSATIVITY TO CAPHINE AT CERTAIN PORTIONS OF THEI MENSTRUAL CYCLE OTHER WOMEN EXPERIENCE A MORE CRAMPING THAN OTHERS A DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLE TREMENDOUS VARIATION FROM INDIVIDUAL TO INDIVIDUALE A ONE OF THE I VIEW IT AS AN ADVANTAGE BUT ONE OF A THINGS THAT MANY FEMALES CAN REALLY DO AND EXPERIENCE BECAUSE THEY HAVE CYCLES THAT OCCUR EVERY MONTH THAT ARE FAIRLY DRAMATIC IN TERMS OF THEI LEVELS OF HORMONESO FOR INSTANCE A MORE THAN THOUSANDFOLD INCREASE IN PROGESTERONE DURING THE LEDLUDIOPHASE OFTHE MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND I SHOULD ALSO MENTION A TWO HUNDREDFOLD INCREASE IN ESTROGEN DURING THE PERIOD JUST PRIOR TO OPULATION THAT'S WHY THEY ALWAYS A ESTROGEN PRIMES PROGESTERONE SO WHAT YOU LEARN IN CON BASIC UNDER CHRONOLOGY WHEN YOUR LEARNING TH MENSTRUAL CYCLE ESTROGEN IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE PRIMES PROGESTERONITHE CYCOND HALF OF THE OF THE OBULATORY MENSTRUAL CYCLE WELL THAT THOSE ESTROGEN INCREASES JUST PRIOR TO OPULATION ARE IMPART RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCREASES IN LEBIDO BUT IT'S ALSO THE PRESENCE OF INCREASE ANDROGEN JUST PRIOR TO OPULATION SO THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLEX INTERPLAY I THINK WHAT WE WILL DO AS WE RESERVE THE DISCUSSION ABOUT LEBIDO PER SAY AND SOME OF THE OTHER ASPECTSURELATE TO SECTUAL DIFFERENTIATION THAT WE TALK ABOUT EARLIER FOR A FUTURE EPISODE BUT HOPEFULLY NOW YOU HAVE IN MIND WHAT THE OBULATORY MENSTRUAL CYCLE IS IT IS A SIGNAL FROM THE BRAIN FROM THE HYPOTHALMETS WHICH THEN TRIGGERS A SIGNAL FROM THE PETUITARY AN ENDICRING GLAND WHICH THEN SIGNALS THE RELEASE OF HORMONES THAT TRAVEL TO THE OVERY AND THAT CONTROL TWO THINGS MATURATION OF EGGS AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF ONE EGG IN PARTICULAR AND THEN PREPARATION OF THE MILEU THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THAT FERTILIZED EG COLD POTENTIALLY LAND AND MATURE INTO A HEALTHY EMBRYO AND CHIL SO IF YOU HAVE THAT FRAMED UP IN YOUR MIND AND EVEN IF YOU JUST EXTRACTED MAY BE TEN TO FIFTEEN PER CENT OF THE HORMONES IN DIFFERENT ASPECTS I DESCRIBED UNTIL NOW I WOULD CONSIDER YOU FAR MORE KNOWLEDGIBLE ABOUT THIS ENTIRE PROCESS THAN NINETY NINE PER CENT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE NOW CERTAINLY NOT THE OBEGUUYANS AND EUROLOGISTS BUT THAN NINETY NINE PER CENTIF INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE IT ALSO FRAMES U FOR US THE SECOND HALF OF THIS WHOLE STORY ABOUT FERTILITY AND FERTILIZATION WHICH IS THE GENERATION OF SPERM AND HOW THE SPERM EVENTUALLY ARRIVE AT THE EGG AND HOW CERTAIN SPERM ARE SELECTED TO POTENTIALLY FERTILIZE THAT EGG WHEREAS OTHERS NEVER REALLY STANED AT CHANCE SO NEXT WORK IN A TALK ABOUT SPERM OREGAN A TALK ABOUT WHAT SPERM ARE WHERE THEY ARE GENERATING HOW THEY ARE GENERATED AND HOW THEY NEED TO TRAVEL BOTH WITHIN THE MALE AND WITHIN THE FEMALE IN ORDER TO ALLOW FERTILIZATION TO POTENTIALLY OCCUR SO WE'VE COVERED THE OBULATORY CYCLE IN FEMALES AND I CONFESS IT WAS A LOT OF INFORMATION WITH A LOT OF BIOLOGICAL NOMIN CLACIER BUT I PROMISE YOU THAN MANY OF THOSE SAME THEMES AND INDEED THE SAME NAMES AN NOMEN CLATURE WE'LL SHOW UP IN THE DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE NOW WHICH IS ABOUT THE GENERATION OF SPRM NOW SPERM ARE SIMILAR TO EGGS IN THE SENSE THAT THEY ARE PART OF THE GERM LINE THERE THESE PROTECTED CELLS PROTECTING THE SENSE THAT THE ACTIVITIES OF AN INDIVIDUAL ARE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE GENETIC MAKE UP OF THOSE CELLS NOW AGAIN THERE ARE INSTANCES IND WHICH MUTIGINS SUCH AS I CHEMICALS COULD DISRUPT THE GENOMES OF THE GERM CELLS AND MALES JUST AS IT COULD IN FEMALES BUT IN GENERAL THE ACTIVITIES THE THINGS THAT WE DO THE EXPERIENCES WE HAVE DOES INTEND TO CHANGE THE GENOMA OF THOSE CELLS HOWEVER THERE ARE A LOT OF LIFE STYLE FACTORS DUES AND DONES NUTRICIAN END SUPPLEMENTS AND PRESCRIPTION DUGS ET CETERA THAT KIN INDEED MODIFY THE QUALITY OF THE SPERM AND WELL TALK ABOUT WHAT SPERM QUALITY MEANS BUT THE PINT IS THAT THE SPERM CELL MUCH LIKE THE EGG CELL ARE BOTH GERM LINE CELLS THEY ARE NOT LIKE SOMATIC CELLS THEY ARE UNIQUE POPULATIONS AND LET'S JUST REMEMBER WHAT THE JOB OF THE SPERMCELL IS THE JOB OF THE SPERM CELL IS TO DELIVER THE GENETIC MATERIAL FROM THE FATHER AND TO DO THAT IN THE FORM OF A HAP LOID CELL SO THAT MEANS TWENTY THREE CROMOZOMES TWENTY TWO ODOZOMES ONE SO CALLED SEX CHROMAZOME AGAIN NOT SEX THE VERB AN WE ST NOT IN THIS CASE SEX THE VERB IS A DISCUSSIONWORE CAN HAVE IN A FEW MINUTES BUT SEX THE NOW THE SEX CHROMOZOME CAN EITHER BE AN EX CHROMOZOME OR A WY CHROMAZONE TE CASE A TWENTY TWO ODOZOMES AND THAN ONE SEX CHROMOZOMIS GOING TO BE CONTAINED WITHIN THE SPERM BECAUSE IT'S A HAPLOD CELL NOT A DIPLOID CELL REMEMBER THE EGG WAS DIPLOID THAN IT BECAME HAPLOID THE SPERM CELLS ARE SELLS THAT ARE CREATED THROUGH THE DIVISION OF OTHER CELLS BUT AFTER THAT DIVISION OCCURS THROUGH A PROCESS CALLED MYOSIS THE SPRM CELL IS GOING TO CONTAIN TWENTY THREE CHROMOZOMES CONSISTING OF TWENTY TWO ADOZOMES AND ONE SEX CROMOZONE AND THE SPERM THAT MANAGES TO DEPOSIT ITS DEANE CONTENTS INTO THE EGG TO FERTILIZE THE EGG WILL EITHER HAVE AN X SEX CROMAOZOME OR A WISEX CHROMAZOME AND THE WYSEX CHROMAZOME HAS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT GENES ON THAT CROMAZOME THAT WILL SUPPRESS FOR INSTANCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE AXIS OF ONE GOOD EXAMPLEWILL BE THE MULARIAN INHIBITING HORMONER AM I H THE GENE FOR MALARING INHIBITING HORMONE WHICH IS A HORMONE THAT PREVENTS THE FORMATION OF THE MULARIAN DUCKS WHICH IS PART OF THE PFEMALE REPRODUCTIVE STRUCTURE WELL THAT GENE CONTROLS THE PROVENTION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FEMALE GENATALIA AND IN DOING SO PROMOTES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MALE GENATILI AND THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES OF GENES THAT ARE ON THE WI CHROMAZOME THAT GIVE YOU A WHAT WE CALL MALE FENOTYPE WRITE YOF GENOTYPE AND PHENATYPE BY THE WAY IN CAUS YOUHAVEN'T A HERD THIS IN AWILE FROM YOUR HY SCHABIOLOGY OR IF YOU NEVER HEARD IT NO BI DEAL CARIOTYPE IS THE COMPLIMENT OF CROMAOZOME EX EX OR EX W AND THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE THAT ARE EXEX WIR EX UYWY A DISCUSSION FOR OUR EPISODE ON SEX TO FRENTIATION THAT'S CARYOTYPE WITH A K THEN THERE'S GENOTYPE WHICH ARE THE GENES THAT YOU HAVE AND THEN THERE'S FENOTYPE SPELLED P H FENO P H E AND O T WIPE FINATYPE AND THE FENATYPE IS HOW THE GENES WHICH THEN CODE FOR AREANE WHICH COT FOR PROTINE HOW THOSE ARE EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF THINGS LIKE IYE COLOURS SO IYE COLOURS A POENATYPE HEIGHT IS A PHOENATYPE HAIR COLOURS A PHOENATYPE OGUSY OF CARYTYPE GENOTYPE AND PHENATYPE WELL WHAT WE NEED TO DO AS WE NEED TO BRING TOGETHER THAT SPIRM WHICH IS HAP LOID CONTAINS THIS TWENTY THREE CHROMOZOMO STRANDS WITH EITHER AN EXRA WY SEX CROMAZOM AS THE TWENTY THIRD CHROMAZOME WE NEED A GET THAT SELL TO THE EGG AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SPERMATA GENESIS OF COURSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE GENERATION OF SPERMCELLS BUT WHAT WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS THE GENERATION OF CELLS WHOSE JOB IS TO DELIVER THE GENETIC MATERIAL FROM DAD TO THE EGG WITHIN THE FEMALE IN A WAY THAT INCREASES THE PROBABILITY THAT NOT ONLY WILL THAT EGG BE FERTILIZED BUT THAT IT WILL PROGRESS IN A HEALTHY WAY WITH EACH SET OF CROMAOZOMES FROM MOM AND FROM DAD EACH SET OF TWENTY THREE CHROMAZOMES THAT IS WE PROGRESS IN A HEALTHY WAY WILL IMPLANT IN A HEALTHY WAY AND WILL MAINTAIN AND GROW IN A EALTHY WAY TO A HEALTHY EMBRYO AND CHILD AND EVENTUALLY ADULT THAT'S THE JOB OF THE SPERM OK SO AS WE TALK ABOUT SPRMATA GENESIS LET'S JUST REMEMBER THAT AND WHY THEYARE THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE NOW A FEW THINGS ABOUT SPERM THAT ARE INTERESTING BESIDES THE FACT THAT THEIR HAP LOID AND BESIDES THE FACT THAT AS YOU ALL KNOW THEY SWIM THEY HVE A HEAD AND A TAILE THEHE OVE A HEAD A MID REGION AND A TAIL N THAT MIDREGION TURNS OUT TO BE VERY IMPORTANT IT SOMETHING WILL COME BACK TO AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT MIDREGION IS REALLY KEY FOR THE ABILITY FOR SPERM TO ENGAGE IN FORWARD PROGRESSION TO SWIM FORWARD AM AN INVOLVES THE ACTIVITY OF M ITOCONDREO WHICH ARE INVOLVED IN GENERATION OF EIHT P WHICH IS INVOLVED IN ALSE ASPECTS OF ENERGY IN ALL CELLS BUT LET JUS REMEMBER THAT THE SPERM ARE SWIMMING CELLS AND IN ORDER TO CREATE A REALLY GOOD SWIMMER OR SET OF SWIMMERS YOU NEED I A COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST OF ALL WITHIN THE TESTIS IS WHERE THE SPERM DEVELOP AND UNLIKE IN FEMALES AND UNLIKE IN THE OVERY THERE'S NO VAULT OF SPERM THE SPERM ARE CONTINUALLY BEING GENERATED TAKES ABOUT SIXTY DAYS FOR SPERM TO BE BORN FROM THEIR PARENT CELLS BECAUSE CELLS ACTUALLY GIVE RISE TO OTHER CELLS US WEIGHT WORKS TO BE BORN FROM THEIR PARENT CELLS AND THEN MATURED TO THE POIN WHRE THEY CAN BE A REALLY GOOD SWIMMER NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT A BUNCH OF SPERM ARE MADE ON DAY ONE AND THEN SIXTY DAYS LATER ALL THOSE SPIRM ARE DEPLOYED IN THE FORM OF EGACULATE AND THEN THE CYCLE STARTS OVER AGAIN SOTS LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THE OPULATORY MENSTRUAL CYCLE RATHER AT ANY GIVEN POIN TIME LIKE RIGHT NOW IF YOU HAVE TESTIES YOU HAVE SOME SPERM IN YOUR TESTIES THAT AR IMMATURE AND CANNOT SWIM CANNOT DELIVER THOSE CONTENTS A TO THOSE GUNETIC CONTENTS RATHER TO THE FEMALE EGG AND YOU HAVE SOME SPERM THA MATURE AND YOU VERY LIKELY HAVE SOME SPERM THAT ARE SO MATURE THAT THEY ARE DYING OFF OR THAT THEIR DEAD ALMOST CERTAINLY ALSO REGARDLESS OF YOUR AGE YOU HAVE SOME SPERM THAT ARE HEALTHIER THAN OTHERS ARE BETTER SWIMMERS THAN OTHERS THIS IS JUST A THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS NOW THE PROCESSOF SPERMATAGENESIS INVOLVES A COUPLE OF THINGS BUT A LOT OF THE PLAYERS ARE THE SAME AS THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE SO CALLED O SITE THE IMMATURE EGG WE'VE GOT GNAR H FROM THE HYPOTHALMUS THATS CAN TO BE A PLAYER WE HAVE EFFISAGE POLICAL STIMULATING HORMONALTHOUGH THE NAMES ALOBIT OF A MISNOMER IN THE CONTECTS OF SPERMATAGENESIS BECAUSE IN THE CONTECTS OF PERMATAGENESIS THERE IS NO FOLICAL WHAT WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT AS EFFISAGE FOR STIMULATING THE MATURATION OF THE SPERM CELL SO NOT EGG FOLICAL BUT SPERM CELL BUT WE STILL HAVE GENER H EFFISGE ELL H AND RATHER THAN THE OVERY BEING THE TARGET OF THOSE HORMONS ITS GOING TO BE THE TESTIES SO MOST EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW THAT THE TESTIES AND THE OVERIES ARE THE SO CALLE GONADS THE TESTIS OF COURSE RESIDE OUTSIDE OF THE BODY THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE THE TESTIES FAIL TO DESCEND DURING DEVELOPMENT CERTAINLY IF THE TESTES DON'T DESCEND ON TIME THAT SOMETHING THAT DOCTORS NEED TO BE MADE AWARE OF THE PEDIATRICION TO BE MADE AWARE OF BECAUSE THAT CAN PREVENT FERTILITY WHY WOULD THAT BE WELL TURNS OUT THAT THE TESTIS RESIDE OUTSIDE THE BODY IN THE SPROTUM BECAUSE THE TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH SPERMATA GENESIS CAN OCCUR AND UNDER WHICH HEALTHY SPERM CAN BE MAINTAINED ARE VERY RESTRICTED AND IS A PROXIMATELY TWO DEGREES COOLER THEN THE REST OF THE BODY THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT AND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT USED TO BE DISCUSSED A LOT MORE BUT ISN'T DISCUSSE SO MUCH THESE DAYS BUT KEEPING THE TESTIS COOL ENOUGH DOESN'T NES SERELY MEAN KEEPING M COLD ALTHOUGH THERE IS A PLACE FOR USING COLD EXPOSURE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE TO IMPROVE SPERM QUALITY AND NUMBER AND PERHAPS EVEN TESTOSTER AN LEVELS WILL TALK ABOUT THET LOBIT LATER BUT KEEPING THE TESTES ABOUT TWO DEGREES COOLER THAN THE REST OF THE BODY IS ABSOLUTELY KEY IF SPERM GET TO HOT THEY DIE AND IF SPERM ATICIZE THE CELLS GET THAT GIVE RISE TO SPERM GET TOO WARM WILL THEN OFTEN TIMES THE SPERM THAT DEVELOP ARE NOT HEALTHY NOT HEALTHY IN A NUMBER WAYS EITHER THEY CAN'T ENGAGE IN FAST FOR PROGRESSION AND SWAT THAT IS SWIMMING OR THEY WILL LACK THE ABILITY TO DEPOSIT THEIR DE ANA CONTENTS WITHIN THE EGG SO AGAIN WHATEVER IS CONTAIN IN THE EJACULATE IS GOING TO BE A MIXTURE OF DIFFERENT SPERM QUALITIES AND SPERM OF DIFFERENT AGES WILL IMPACT THE QUALITY BUT ALSO THE TEMPERATURE UNDER WHICH THOSE SPERM DEVELOPED IS GOING TO IMPACT THEIR QUALITY AND SO WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO TOOLS TO LIIT LATER AS I MENTION BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU AA SIMPLE TAKE AWAY IF YOU ARE HOPING TO CONCEIVE IN THE NEXT NINETY DAYS RIGHT THE SPERM ATIGENIS TI CYCLE TAKE SIXTY DAYS BUT THEN THE SPERM ACTUALLY HAVE TO MIGRATE FROM THE TESTACLE INTO THE SO CALLED EPIDITIMUS WHICH IS A RELATED STRUCTURE AND THEN INTO THE VAST DEFERENCE AND THEN INTO THE RETHROW WHERE IT CAN BE PART OF THE EJACULATE IN ORDER FOR SPERM TO DO ALL THAT PROPERLY UNDERGO THAT MATURATION AND THEN EXIT IN EJACULATE IN A WAY THAT'S HEALTHY OR THAT THE SPERM IS HEALTHY IF YOU PLAN TO CONCEIVE CHILDREN OR TO TRY AND CONCEIVE CHILDREN IN THE NEXT NINETY DAYS YOU DEFINLY WANT TO AVOID EXPOSING YOURE TESTACLES THAT IS YOUR SCRODUM TO ELEVATED TEMPERATURES SO THAT MEANS DEFINITELY AVOIDING HOT TUBS DEFINILY YOU AVOIDING HOT BATHS NOW A BRIEF HOT BATH OR HOT TUB OR HOT SHOWER ISN'T GOING TO BE A PROBLEM ALTHOUGH IF YOUARE REALLY INTERESTING CONCEIVING I WOULD AVOID HOT TUBS AND AND HOT BATHS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE HOT SHOWERS ARE PROBABLY FINE BUT IF YOU ARE GOING TO GOING TO A SAWNOGH FOR INSTANCE YOU MIGHT WANT TO RETHINK THAT DECISION AND IF YOU DO TOCIDE TO YOU ALMOST CERTAINLY WOULD WANT TO BRING A COLD PACK IN THAT YOU COULD A WFULLY PUT SOME MATERIAL BETWEEN THE COLD PACK AND ANSCROTUMACY DON'T GET A COLD BURN BUT PUT SOMETHING THERE BUT KEEP THE SCRORDAL TISSUE COOL KEEP IT COLD TO COOL BECAUSE HEAT EXPOSURE CAN REALLY MUTATE AND DESRRUPT THE DEVELOPING SPERM AND IT CAN KILL SPERM AND SO AGAIN THAT WOULD BE FOR AN ENTIRE NINETY DAYS LEADING UP TO YOUR ATTEMPTS TO TO CONCEIVE AGAIN WELL GET INTO MORE TO US LATER BUT A NUMBER PEOPLE ALSO I HAVE PROBABLY HEARD OF THE BOXERS VERSES BRIEFS A  CONTROVERSY I GESS IT IT IS UM OR WHETHER NOT A PEOPLE CALL IT I GOING COMMANDO WITH NO UM WITH NO UNDERWARE OF ANY KIND BOXERS BRIEFERS BRIEFS OR OTHERWISE RATHER TURNS OUT THAT THE DATE ON THAT POINT TO THE FACT THAT THERE ISN'T REALLY A BIG DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF SPERM QUALITY IF PEOPLE WEARE BOXERS ARE BRIEFS OR DON WHERE ANYTHING UNDER THER A GENES OR SHORTS AT ALL A THE SCROTUM HAS THE ABILITY TO MOVE THE TESTACLES FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE BODY IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE LOWER TEMPERATURES IF IT NEDS TO IT IT CHIEVES THAT THROG A MUSCLE CALL THE CREMASTER MUSCLE WHICH IS A REALLY INTERESTING MUSCLE BELIEVE IT OR NOT AS READING UP ON THE BIOLOGY THE REMASTER MUSCLE SOMETHING I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SPEND O TOO MUCH TIME ON BUT THAT I END ID UP SPENDING FAR TOO MUCH TIME A READING UP ABOUT AND I'S REALLY FASTENING WHAT YOU HAVE IS A IS A A MUSCLE THERE'S A SMOOTH MUSCLE TISSUE UNLIKE SKELETO MUSCLE WHICH AS STRIDE IN MUSCLE THAT IS TEMPERATURE DEPENDENT SO IT HAS CERTAIN NERVE ENDINGS AND IT HAS CERTAIN A RECEPTERS ON IT THAT ALLOW IT TO RESPOND TO LOCAL TEMPERATURE AND THEN TO RELAX IN ORDER TO A ESSENTIALLY LET THE TESTACLES TO DESCEND FURTHER FROM THE BODY OR TO CONTRACT AND BRING THE TESTACLES CLOSER THE BODY IN ORDER TO TRY AND MAINTAIN THE OPTIMAL TEMPERATURE RANGE AND IT TURNS OUT THE CREMASTER MUSCLE CAN ACHIEVE THAT WHETHER NOT PEOPLE ARE WEARING BOXERS OR BRIEFS ALTHOUGH IT STANDS TO REASON THAT ANY KIND OF A THERE'S NO HOTHER NAME FOR UNDERGARMENTS YOU NOT NO WHY THAT WORD IS  JUST SEEMS KIND OF ANTIQUATED BUT UNDERGARMENT THAT ALLOWS SOME MOVEMENT OF THE OF THE SCROTUM IN THE TESTACLES SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW THESE UM TEMPERATURE A VARIATIONS TO OCCUR AND KEEP KEEP THINGS IN RANGE A THAT SAID LOBIT LATER WLL GO INTO SOME DETAIL REALLY BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT AS TO WHY FOR INSTANCE IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO HAS BIG THIGHS  OR NOT THAT IT ACTIALYCAN LOWER SPIRM COUNT SUBSTANTIALLY WHETHER NOT THE BIG THIGHS OCCUR BECAUSE YOU'R VERY MUSCULAR THE BIG THIGHS OCCUR BECAUSE YOU A ARE OVER WEIGHT IT CAN INCREASE THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SITTING A LOT INCREASE S SCROTAL TEMPERATURE FOR SURE AND THERE ARE SOME OTHER TINGS THAT CAN INCREASE SCROTAL TEMPERATURE OF SEAT HEATERS IN CARS FOR INSTANCE TERRIBLE IDEA IF YOU JUST TERRIBLE IDEA IF YOU'RE HOPING TO CONCEIVE IN THE NEAR FUTURE A AND AGAIN HOT TUB THINGS OF THAT SORT O CAS SO TEMPERATURE MODULATION OF SPERMATA GENESIS AND SPIRM QUALITY AND FUNCTION IS KEY THAT RELATE TO LOBIT MORE TO TOOLS BUT WHAT HAPPENS HATIS THE ACTUAL SPERM DEVELOP WELL CONTAIN WITHIN THE TESTACLE YOU HAVE THE CELLS THE SO CALLED SPERMATIC GONIA WHICH DIFFERENTIATE INTO SO CALLED SPERMATICIDES YOU DON'T HAVE TO REMEMBER ALL THIS AND THE SPERMATICIDES UNDERGO THIS PROCESS OF MYOSIS MYOSIS IS A FORM OF SELL DIVISION WHICH REDUCES THE CROMOZOME NUMBER TO THOSE TWENTY THREE INDIVIDUAL STRANDS HAS OPPOSED TO PAIRS RIGHT SO IT MAKES THEM HALP LOID IS OPPOSED TO DIPLOIT VERY VERY IMPORTANT FOR REASONS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER AND THE MYOSIS PROCESS IN THESE PRIMORDIAL SPERM CELLS THESE IMMATURE SPERM CELLS IS SIMILAR TO THE MYOSIS PROCES THAT OCCURS IN EGGS WHEN THE CROMISOM SEGREGATE IN THAT INVOLVES THESE SPINDLE LIKE A STRUCTURES WITHIN THE CELL NOW WHY DO I KEEP BRINGING UP THE SPINDLES WHILL TURNS OUT THAT THE FUNCTION OF THE SPINDLE IN THE EGG IN THE SPERM IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON MITA CONJUREAL FUNCTION AND LATER WHEN WE GET INTO TOOLS FOR IMPROVING EGG AND SPIRM QUALITY YOU'ARE GING TO HEARABOUT A LOT OF TOOLES FOR IMPROVING MITACONDRIA AND IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE THE MITA CONJUR INVOLVED IN IN ENERGY DEMAND ING ASPECTS OF CELL BIOLOGY BUT IT'S ALSO BECAUSE THE MIGHTA CONDRE IN THIS CONTECT ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE REMOVAL OF ERE THE SEPARATION OF ONE SET OF CROMOZONES TO GIVE YOU THESE TWO SETS OF HAPLOID CELLS THE EGG AND THE SPERM AND THIS IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE MANY FAILURES AT FERTILIZATION MANY FAILURES AT IMPLANTATION MANY MANY MISCARRIAGES AND MANY BIRTH EFFECTS THAT DO SURVIVE AFTER BIRTH THAT ARE VERY DETRIMENTAL SUCH AS TRISIMES AND THINGS LIKE THAT OCCUR BECAUSE THE SPINDLES DON'T EFFECTIVELY PULL APART THE CROMOZOMES IND THE TYPICALLY THE EGG BUT IT CAN ALSO OCCUR IN THE SPERM CSO THE SPINDLES AND THE FACT THAT MIGHT AVE CONTRAR RICH ON THE SPINDLE ARE VERY IMPORTNT FOR GENERING THESE HAPLOID SPERM AGAIN TWENTY THREE INDIVIDUALS TRANSICROMOZOMES THAT'S O CURRING INSIDE OF THE TESTES O CE SO THERE'S NOT AS MUCH LONG DISTANCE MIGRATION OF THE SPERMATUS OF THE SPERMATICIDES AND THE SPERM CELLS AS THERE IS THE EGG JUST WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE OVER ALL ARCHITECTURE OF THE UTERIS IN TH FLOPIAN TUBES COMPARED TO THE TESTACLES WIT A STILL LOT OF MOVEMENT SO WITHIN THE TESTACAL IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT THE TESTACLE IN CROSS SECTION AND I PREFER TO CALL AT THAT RATHER THAN CUT THE TESTACALE AND HALF ANY TIMEYOU TOCK ABOUT ANATOMY I SHE TALK ABOUT SLICING THINGS THA'S WHAT YOU WOULD DO IN WITH A CADAVEROUS WAT U I TEACHIN WE DO UM MY LABORATORIAN  FRANKLY IN BIOLOGICAL LABORATORIES ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABY THE YOUTO TALK ABOUT IF YOU WERE TO TAKE A VISUAL CROSS SECTION THROUGH THE TESTACLE WHAT YOU WOULD FIND IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT LITTLE TUBES LOT OF DUCKS DW C T ASDUCKS THOSE ARE PATHWAYS AND THE MAN DUCKS THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR THIS DISCUSSION ARE CALLED THE SEMINIFEROUS TUBULES OCASOITS OF IT'S A A MASHLIKE OR NETWORK STRUCTURE OF TUBES IN THE TESTACLE AND THE IMMATURE SPERM SIT ON A LITTLE COMPARTMENT U ALONG THE EDGE OF THOSE TUBES AND AS THEY MATURE THEY MOVE TOWARDS THE CENTERE OF THOSE TUBES AND THEN WHEN THEY ARE MATURE ENOUGH THOSE SPERM CELLS ACTUALLY DROP INTO THE HOLLOW OF THE TUBE AND THEN CAN TRAVEL THROUGH THOSE TUBES TO A STRUCTURE THAT ALONG THE SIDE OF THE TESTACAL CALLED THE EPIDITIMUS THE EPIDITIMUS AGAIN AS A SERIES OF DUCKS AND THEN THE EPIDITIMUS CONVERGES WITH SOMETHN CALLED THE VAST DEFERENS OK THING IN HIGH SCHOOL WE ALL REMEMBER THIS BY THING ABOUT IT'S THE VAST DIFFERENCE I ONO THAT ONO WHO CAME UP WITH THAT MAYBE I THINK IT WAS A YOUNG GIRL SITTING TO THE LEFT OF ME THAT WA SYCHOITS LIKE THE VAST DIFFERENCE I NEVER FORGOT THAT NO MAY BAS THE TOPIC MATTER MAYBE WAS HEARD MAY WITH SOME COMMINATION OF THE TUBE BUT IN ANY CASE THE SPERM GO FROM THE SEMINIFEROUS TUBULES TO THE EPIDITIMUS AND THEN TO THE VAST DEFERENS AND THEN ARE CONTAINED IN THE EGJACULATE ALONG WITH SEMINAL FLUID NOW THE SEMINAL FLUID IS THE CARRIER FLUID FOR THE SPERM THEMSELVES THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT A LOT OF THINGS THAT CAN BOTH NEGATIVELY OR POSITIVELY IMPACT THE QUALITY OF THE SPERM RELATES NOTCH S TO THE SPERM CELLS THEMSELVES AND THE TEMPERATURE THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY WERE A MATURED IN BUT ALSO TO THE SEAMEN QUALITY FOR INSTANCE IF YOU ARE A HEAVY DRINKER OR IF YOU ARE A SMOKER OR IF YOU ARE A REGULAR USER OF CANIBUS ESPECIALIF YOU SMOKE CANIBUS ARE OR VAPE CANABAS YOU CREATE A LOT OF REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES THAT DISRUPT THE CHEMISTRY OF THE SEMINAL FLUID WHICH DESRUPTS THE SPERMCELLS SOS NOT A DIRECT ACTION ALWAYS ON THE SPRM CELL ITSELF ALTHOUGH IT CAN BE SO FERENCES IN THE FORM OF OF SMOKED TOBACCO OR CANABAS THERERA LOT OF CARCINIGENS AND MUTIGENS ACTION MUTATE THE DIANA CAN CAUSE DEANA FRAGMENTATION AND DEBILITATE SPERM BUT THERARE ALSO A LOT OF THINGS CREATED BY SMOKING IN PARTICULAR WHETHER REGARDLESS OF WHAT'S BEING SMOKE THEY CAN CREATE ELEVATED REACT OYGEN SPECIES AND DISRRUPT THE SEMINAL FLUID THAT THE SPERM ARE CONTAINED IN IN THE SO CALLED THE JACULA THE SEAMEN NOW THIS WILL ALSO BECOME A RELEVANT CONVERSATION LATER WHEN WE BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT VESECTOMIES VESECTOMIES IT ARE LITERALLY A CUTTING OF THE VAST DEFERENS WHICH LEADS TO A SITUATION PROVIDED THE SURGERY WAS DONE CORRECTLY WHERE MEN CAN STILL ACHIEVE ALL THE OTHER ASPECTS OF INTERCOURSE THEY CAN STILL A ACHIEVEERECTION THEY CAN STILL ACHIEVE ORGASM THEY CAN STILL EJACULATE BUT WHEN THEY EJACULATE THE SEMINAL FLUID IS RELEASED BUT THERE RE NO SPERM CONTAIN WITHIN THE SEMINA FLUID AND IT TURNS OUT THAT A THE SECTOMES ARE VERY EFFECTIVE FORM OF BERTH CONTROL AND THEY ALWAYS CHECK TO SEE IF ZERO SPERM AND CONFIRM THE ZERO SPERM ARE BEING A RELEASED IN THEJACULATE THEY ARE REVERSIBLE THAT IS VESECTOMES ARE REVERSIBLE BUT NOT ALWAYS THERE ARE A SUBSET OF CASES WHERE IT'S NOT REVERSIBLEIN WHICH CASE OF PEOPLE STILL ONT HAVE CHILDREN YOU HAVE TO GO IN AND ACTUALLY SURGICALLY EXTRACT A SPERM FROM THE TESTACLES BUT IT'S A PROCESS IN WHICH THE VASTDEFERENS IS ALTERED WERE SEVERED IN A WAY THAT THE SPERM CANT ACTUALLY EXIT THE TESTACL THEY CAN GET INTO THE EPIDITIMUS USUALLY BUT NOT INTO THE VASTEFERENCE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH A SO IF YOU'VE EVER WONDER WHANE OF A SECTOME IS THAT'S WHAT OF A SECTOME IS AND I MENTION A SECTOME NOW BECAUSE IT ILLUSTRATES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SEMINAL FLUID THE SEAMEN AND THE SPERM THAT THE SEAMEN CONTAIN C SO SIXTY DAYS TO GENERATE THESE THESPERM ANOTHER A TWO WEEKS ARE SO FOR THE SPERM TO TRAVEL THROUGH THE VARIOUS DUCKS TO THE POINT WHERE THEY CAN BE CONTAINED IN THE EJACULATE LUTS TALK ABOUT THE SPERM CELLS THEMSELVES THE SPERM CELLS AGAIN HAVE THE TWENTY THREE PAIRS OF A SINGLESTERIN CHROMIZOMS THEIR HAPLOID IF THE EITHER IN EX OR WHY SEX CROMOZOM AS THE TWENTY THIRD SO CALLED SEX CROMAZOM AND AS WE ALL KNOW THEY HAVE A HEAD THAT HEAD TENDS TO BE OVAL AN MOST CASES THE HEAD CONTAINS VERY IMPORTANT ENZIMES AND PROTINES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO FUSE W IT THE MUCH LARDERTUR EGG AND TO ACTUALLY TAKE THE MEMBRANE OF THE SPERM CELL AND COMBINED ACTUALLY MESH WITH THE EGG CELLS MEMBRANE AND THEN DELIVER THE GENETIC CONTENTS TO THE EGG CELL IN OTHER WORDS TO FERTILIZE THE EGG CELL NOW JUST BEHIND THE HEAD IS A REGION CALLED THE MID REGION THAT MID REGION IS A SLIGHTLY THICKENED REGION AND HERE A CORSONTOCAMBAL HEALTHY SPERM CELL MOR PHOLOGY MOREPHOLOGY SIMPLY MEAN SHAPE A MID REGION THAT MID REGION HAS A BUNCH OF THINGS RELATED TO SELL MOTILITY AND TO THE FORD PROGRESSION OF THE CELLS FIRST OF ALL IT IS CHALKA BLOCK FULL OF MIDOCONDRE IN FACT IF YOU ARE TO LOOK JUST BEHIND THE HEAD OF THE OF THE SPERM WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT IT IS COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY MIDA CONDREO THERE ARE MIGHT A CONJURY ELSEWHERE IN THE CELL BUT MOST OF THEM ARE CONTAINED IN THIS MID REGION COMPARTMENT JUST BEHIND THE HEAD OF THE SPERM AND THAT THICK REGION IS WHERE THE TAIL MOVEMENT OF THE SPERM THE O THE FLAGULATION BACK AND FORTH IS ACTUALLY GENERATED FROM MUCH LIKE IF YOU WERE TO HOLD A ROPE YOU LIKE A BATTLE ROPE IN THE GION O AND YOU WERE TO A YOU KNOW WHIP THE BATTLE ROPE THE WHIP AT THE ONE END OF THE ROPE IS WHAT ALLOWS FOR THE O THE THE LHISS JUST CALL WHAT IT IS THAT THE CURVES IN THE ROPE THAT THE OSCILLATIONS THE RISING AND FALLING OF OF THE ROPE ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE END RIGHT IS THE FORCE OF THE OF THE WHIP RIGHT AT THAT END THAT YOUR YOU KNW WITH THE BATTLE ROPE YOU DOING WITH YOUR HAND AND WITH THE SPERMOOT THAT IS OCCURRING JUST BEHIND THE HEAD OF THE SPERM THAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO TATE HOW FAST AND HOW WELL THAT SPERM CAN SWIM AND INDEED THE SPERM HAS TO SWIM VERY FAR HOW FAR WELL ON A RELATIVE SCALE AND AGAIN THESE ARE ESTIMATIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO BE A HUSHAWE SAY THERE WILL BE DIFFERENCE IS IN THE DISTANCE FROM THE HEAD OF THE PINUS AND WHERE THE EJACULATION OCCURS TO THE SERVICS DEPENDING ON THE RELATIVE SIZE OF THE VAGENAL CANAL AND THE PENUS THAT DELIVERS THE EJACULATE TO THE VAGENAL CANAL BUT ONCE THE SPERM ARRIVE AT THE SERVIC CE WHICH IS AT THE BACK OF THE AGENAL CANAL JUST AT THE OPENING TO THE UTERUS ONCE THE SPERM ARRIVE THERE THE DISTANCE FROM THE SERVICS TO THE EGG OF COURSE WILL VERY DEPENDING ON WHERE THAT EGG IS IN ITS OVULATORY TRAJECTORY ITS PATHWAY BUT IT IS A KIN BASE IF YOU SCALE FOR SIZE TO THE DISTANCE BETWEEN LOST ANGELIS AND SAN FRANCISCO WHICH IS MANY MANY HUNDREDS OF MILES SO THOGH SPERM HAVE TO SWIM VERY FAR NOW OF COURSE IF THE SPERM ARE DELIVERED IN THE VAGENAL CANAL SOMEWHAT FURTHER AWAY THEY WILL HAVE FURTHER TO GO IF THERE DELIVERED RIGHT AT THE CERVICAL OPENING THEY WILL HAVE LESS FAR TO GO THE VERY EFFECTIVE SWIMMING SPERM SWIM VERY FAST SO THEY ARE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT T ISTANCE IN JUST A FEW DAYS AND THIS RELATES TO A DISCUSSION THAT WE WILL GET INTO IN A LOT MORE DETAIL LATER AS TO HOW OFTEN COUPLES SHOULD HAVE INTERCOURSE IF THEY'RE TRYING TO CONCEIVE MAYPEOPLE MIGHT THINK WELL ITS EVERY DAY HOWEVER THE MORE FREQUENT THE EJACULATION THE LOWER THE CONCENTRATION OF SPERM IN EACH EJACULATE SO THIS IS NOT DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW OFTEN TO HAVE INTERCOURSE DEPENDING TO YOUR PREFERENCES FOR PLEASURE OR BONDING OR WHATEVER REASON THIS IS A DISCUSSION ABOUT HOFTEN TO HAVE INTERCOURSE IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE THE PROBABILITY OF FERTILIZATION OF THE EGG THERE SOME GENERAL RULES THAT OF COURSE COME TO MIND WHICH IS EJACULATIONS CLOSE TO OPULATION BOTH BE FOUR JURING OR SOMETIMES AFTER ARE OBVIOUSLY ADVANTAGEOUS BUT YOU WILL ALSO HERE OBIGUWIANS IN EUROLOGISTS SUGGESTING INTERCOURSE EVERY OTHER DAY LEADING UP TO THE DAY OF OBULATION STARTING ABOUT THREE TO FOUR DAYS OUT FROM THE DAY OF OPULATION SO WE GOT A LITTLE BIT SIDE TRACT ALL BE IT I THINK APPROPRIATELY SO AND FOCUSSING ON FERTILIZATION BUT WHATE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT UP INTO THE POINT OF THAT IS THE ANATOMY OF THE SPERM ITSELF WHICH IS THE HEAD THE MID REGION THAT CONTAINS ALL THOSE MYTOCONDRIA AND THEN THE TAL NOW WHAT WE HAVE IN DISCUSSED IS THE ACTUAL GENERATION OF THE SPERM SO IF YOU ARE A MALE OR IF YOU ARE A FEMALE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOWSEPERMATAGENESIS WORKS SPERBATAGENESIS WORKS IN MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE GENERATION AND MATURATION OF EGGS WORK ALTHOUGH AS I MENTION BEFORE IT'S GOING TO OCCUR ON GOING THROUGHOUT THE CYCLE OF THE MALE'S LIFE AFTER PUBERTY WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT PUBERTY ANDILGIS COVER THIS IN TWO OR THREE SENTENCES AS IT RELATES TO MALES AND ITS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING THE HYPOTHALMUS UP UNTIL THE POINT OF PUBERTY IS PROVIDING SUPPRESSION OF THE RELEASE OF GANATROPAND RELEING HORMONE THEN SOME BIOLOGICAL CLOCK WHICH IS STILL NOT CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD ITS PROBABLY NOT LEPT IN COMING FROM BODY FAT AGAIN UNLIKE IN THE FEMALES PROBABLY NOT LEPT IN COMING FROM BODYFAT BUT SOME OTHER SIGNAL ARRIVES TO THE HYPOTHALMUS REMOVES THAT INHIBITION AND GE IN OUR ACH CANATROPAND RELEASING HORMONE IS NOW RELEASED ON TO THE PATUITARY A BUNCH OF HORMONES ARE DEPLOYED FROM THE PETUITARY AS A CONSEQUENCE THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT ONES FOR THE CONTECT OF THIS DISCUSSION ARE PHOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE AND LUTINIZING HORMONE PHOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE AND LUTINIZING HORMONE TRAVEL TO THE TESTES AND THEY RE GOING TO DO TWO MAIN THINGS ONE THEY ARE GOING TO TRIGGER THE PRODUCTION OF TESTOSTERONE AND THEY ARE GOING TO TRIGGER THE PRODUCTION OF THE SPERM THEMSELVES THEY ARE GOING TO SET IN MOTION FOR ESPENCTIALLY THE REST OF THE LIFE OF THE MALE THE PRODUCTION OF SPERM THEY'RE OING TO INITIATE THE SPERMATAGENISA CYCLE AND THAT CYCLES CAN BE ON GOING AT VARIOUS STAGES FOR DIFFERENT SPERM FOR THE REST OF THE MAN'S LIFE THIS V ERY DIFFERENT THEN THE TRIGGERING OF DEVELOPMENT OF OSITES AND EGGS AN FEMALES WHERE THERE'S AN EXISTING VAULT THAT VAULT CAN BE DEPLETED TO THE POINT OF ZERO WHERE IT CANTS OCCUR AGAIN MEN CAN GENERATE SPERM THEIRE ENTIRE LIFETIME COURSE THERE'S DIMINISHMENT OF SPERM PRODUCTION IN VERY VERY LATE AGE SAY EIGHTIES AND NINETIES OR HUNDREDS BUT BELIEVE ARE NOT THEIR STILL SPERM BEING PRODUCE THE QUALITY OF THOSE SPERM IS ANOTHER QUESTION SO EVERYTHING WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT NOW IS ESSENTIALLY PUBERTY ONWARD A PRIOR TO THAT TESTACLES ARE PRESENT BUT THERE NOT GENERATING SPERM EJACULATION IS IN POSIBLE OR IF IT IS POSSIBLE ITS VERY ONLIKELY AND UNUSUAL AND ITS NOT GOING TO CONTAIN SPERM EVERYTHING WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT NOW IS PUBERTY FORWARD O CASO PUBERITY ONWARD TO THE REST OF LIFE AND LUTINIZING HORMONE SECRETED FROM THE PETUITARY ACTS ON THE TESTIS AND ON A VERY SPECIFIC CELL TYPE IN THE TESTIES CALLED THE LID EGCELLS ARE LADEGCELLS EL E WY DE IGE THE LAD EGCELLS THE LAD EGCELLS OF THE TESTIS ARE WHAT PRODUCED TESTOSTROE TESTOSTRONE IS GOING TO HAVE TWO MAJOR EFFECTS ON HERE IMEAN REALLY MAJOR BECAUSE IT HAS MANY MANY HUNDREDS OF EFFECTS ON DIFFERENT TISSUES OF THE BODY IN FACT THAT'S THE DEFINITION OF A HORMONE REALLY ITS AY ITS A SUBSTANCE THAT ACTS IN AN INDICRINT FASHION IT CAN ACT ON THE VERY TISSUE THAT GENERATED IT SO FOR INSTANCE TESTAOSTRONE MADE BY THE LID EGELLS WITHIN THE TESTIES WILL ACT ON THE TESTISES WILL TALK ABOUT A MOMENT BUT IT CAN ALSO ACT ON OTHER TISSUES IT CAN ACT ON THE FARRINGS AND LARINGS AND DEEP IN TE VOICE AS IT DOES DURING PUBERITY CAN ACT ON THE HEIRFOLICALS IN GENERATE FICIAL HAIR IT CAN ACT ON THE MUSCULATUREIN GENERATE PROACING SYNTHESIS AND DEVELOPMEN MUSCLE BONE ET CETERA O AT ALL THE THINGS WE ASSOCIATE WITH PUBERITY AND WITH TESTOSTRONE TYPICALLY RESTRICTING THE CONVERSATION TO THE EFFECTS OF TESTOSTRONE ON THE TESTACLE ITSELF AND ON SPERMATI GENESIS THE LIDIGELLS MAKE TESTOSTRONE AND KEEP IN MIND THAT SOME OF THAT TESTOSTRONAL TRAVEL ELSEWHERE IN THE BODY AND DO ITS THING FOR GENE EXPRESSION AND THE MORE ACUTIFECTS OF TESTOSTRONE ON THE BRAIN INCLUDED BUT THE TESTOSTRONE WITHIN THE TESTIES IS AT EXTREMELY HIGH CONCENTRATION IN FACT THE CONCENTRATION OF INTERETESTICULAR TESTOSTRONE IS AT LEAST A HUNDRED TIMES HIGHER THAN THE CONCENTRATION OF TESTOSTRONE ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE BODY EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEING SECRETED INTO THE REST OF THE BODY AND THAT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SO CALLED BINDING PROTINES AND ENZINES THAT SEQUESTER THE TESTOSTRONE WITHIN THE TESTIS SO THE LID IGCELLS ARE MAKING TESTOSTRONE A LOT OF THAT TESTOSTRONE IS ACTING ON AND IS RESTRICTED TO THE TESTIES AND THAT TURNS OUT TO BE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE TESTOSTRONE WITHIN THE TESTIS ACTS IN CONCERT WITH A DIFFERENT BIOLOGICAL PROGRAME THAT STARTS WITH EFISAGE PHOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE THAT ALSO TRAVELS TO THE TESTIES AND ACTS ON A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF SELLS THAT ARE CALLED SUPPORTING CELLS OR MORE SPECIFICALLY THE CERTOLLY CELLS THE SERTOLY CELLS ARE THE CELLS THAT GENERATE SOMETHING CALLED A B P OR ANDROGEN BINDING PROTINE AND IT IS THE COMBINATION OF TESTOSTERON FROM THE LID EXCELLS AND A B P FROM THE CERTOLY CELLS THAT IS NECESSARY FOR SPERMATAGENESIS IT'S NECESSARY FOR THOSE SPERMATESITES TO BECOME WHAT WILL EVENTUALLY BE HEALTHY MATURE SPRM THAT HAVE REALLY NICE SHAPED OVALHEADS HAVE A MID REGION CHOCA BLOCK THROUGH MITOCONDRIA AND CAN GENERATE A FAST WHIPPING MOTION OF THE TEIL TO SWIM FROM THE SERVICS ARE UP THE GINAN TO THE SERVICS AND FROM THE SERVICS TO THE EGG TO FERTILIZE THE EGG SO IT'S REALLY A BASIC SET OF CHEMICAL PLAYERS THAT ARE INVOLVED HERE AND SO BASIC IN FACT THAT IF YOU WERE TO DESRRUPT ANY ONE OF THESE CHEMICAL PLAYERS EITHER THE LUTINIZING HORM ON THE EPHISATE THE TESTOSTERUM FOR THE LIHT EXCELLS OR ANDROGEN BINING PROTINE YOU WOULD OBSERVE PRETTY MARKED DESRUPTION INSPERMATAGENESIS OR THE ELIMINATION OF SPERM ENTIRELY WILL GET INTO A FEW DEPHISISTS AND SPERM DEVELOPMENT AND SPERM NUMBER AND SPERM FUNCTION LI BIT LATER BUT JUST KEEP IN MIND OR I SHOULD SAY MAY BE SIT BACK AND JUST APPRECIATE THAT THE EXACT SAME PLAYERS GENORATE FROM THE HYPOTHELEMIS WHICH CAUSES LUTINIZING HORMON AND PHOLICAL TIMULATE HORMON RELEASE FROM THE POTUITARY WHICH TRAVELS TO THE GONAD WHICH IN THIS CASES THE TESTACLE WHICH TRIGGERS THE RELEASE OF TESTOSTERUM FROM LID EXCELLS WHICH TRIGGERS THE ACTION OF THE SUPPORTING CELLS THE SERTOLY CELLS WHICH MAKE ANDROGEN BINING PROTINE TESTOCTERON AND ANDROGEN BINING PROACHING COMBINE AND CREATE A CHEMICAL AND ACTUALLY ESTRUCTERAL MILU IN WHICH THOSE LITTLE SPERMATOCITES CAND GO FROM THE WALLS FROM LITERALLY THE WALLS OF THE TUBES OF THE SEMINIFEROUS TUBULES CAN MATURE INTO HEALTHY WELL DEVELOPED SPRM AND CAN HOP INTO THOSE DUCTS THOSE LITTLE TUBES AND THEN HEAD OFF TO TE EPIDITIMUS WHERE THEY WILL RESIDE THE EPIDITIMUS IS THE TISSUE NEARBY THE TESTACAL AR SURROUNDING ONE PORTION OF THE TESTACLE AND THEN EVENTUALLY FUSE WITH THE VAST DEFERENS CAN COMBINE WITH OR BE CONTAINED WITH RATHER THE SEMINAL FLUID AND THEN CAN BE EGACULATED VITHE URETHRA INTO THE FEMALE WERE THAN THEY CAN SWIM VERY QUICKLY FECTIVELY THE DISTANCE FOR THEM ANYWAY FROM LOS ANGELIST TO SAN FRANCISCO OVER THE COURSE OF A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND FERTILIZE THE EGG SO THAT'S THE PROCESS OF SPERMATAGENESIS THE MATURATION OF SPERM WHICH IS ON GOING THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPAN FROM PUBRITY ONWARD AND IN DOING SO WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE HORMONAL ELEMENTS COMING FROM THE HYPOTHELEMUS AND COMING FROM THE PETUITARY AND WITHIN THE TESTIS THEMSELLS THE LED EXCELLS WHICH PRODUCED A STOCER ON THE SERTOLY CELLS RHICH OF THE SUPPORT CELLS THAT ALOW SPERMATAGENESIS TO OCCUR WITH THAT IN MIND NEXT I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT'S ACTUALLY CONTAINED IN THE EGJACULATE INTERMS OF NUMBERS OF SPERM AND WHAT'S REALLY BEING SELECTED FOR INTERMS OF THE SPERM THAT ACTUALLY SUCCESSFULLY FERTILIZES THE EGG AND WHAT SORTS OF ELEMENTS COME INTO PLAY IN DICTATING WHETHER NOT FERTILIZATION WILL OR WON'T OCCUR AND THE MAJOR THEMES THAT WERE GOING TO DISCUSS ARE FREQUENCY OF EJACULATION BUT REALLY THAT'S JUST KIND OF A PROXY FOR TALKING ABOUT MAXIMIZING SPERM CONCENTRATION AND QUALITY OF SPERM ARRIVING AT THE EGG RIGHT BECAUSE REMEMBER OVULATION IN THE MENSTRAL CYCHL OR REALLY ABOUT CREATING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FERTILIZATION  AND WE ARE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE VAGINAL DUCT THE VAGINA AND THE MILEU AROUND THE SERVIXS AND SOME OTHER ELEMENTS WITHIN THE FEMALE HERSELF CONTRIBUTE TO AND SUPPORT THE SPERM IN THEIR JOURNEY TO THE EGG AND IN THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL FERTILIZE THE EGG SO REALLY WHAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT FIRST IS SPERM QUALITY AND WE SHOULD ALSO PROBABLY TALK ABOUT EJACULATE QUALITY BECAUSE AS ODD IS THAT THEME MIGHT SEEM REALLY THE JACULATE QUALITY WHICH HAS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PERAMETERS INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF MATURE SPERM THAT ARE NOT SO MATURE THAT THEIRE SWIMMING SLOWER ARE DEGD BUT ALSO QUALITIES PROM THE HAVE FERNCSES ONE TAILE IT'S NOT ENTIRELY UNCOMMENTO SEE SPERM WITH TWO TAILS RIGHT BECAUSE THEY JUST INFORM PROPERLY OR SPERM THAT ARE NOT MOVING VERY MUCH AM IN FACT SPERM MOTILITY IS SCORED ALONG A SCALE OF ZERO ONE TWO OR THREE THREE BEING THE BEST FOR FAST FORWARD PROGRESSING A ZERO IS NOT MOVING AT ALL A ONE THEIR ACTUALLY CALLED TWITCHERS RIGHT TWITCHERS ARE SPERM THAT S OR JUST TWITCHING PLACE BUT DON'T UNDERGO FORWARD PROGRESSION TWO IS SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN A ONE AND THREE NOT SURPRISINGLY DIFFERENT CLINIXS DIFFERENT OBIGUIENDS DIFFERENT EUROLOGISTS WILL THROWHOUT DIFFERENT NUMBERS BUT IN GENERAL IT IS HOPED THAT MORE THAN FIFTY PER CENT OF THE SPERM SHOULD BE MOTILE IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER SON NOT SCORING A ZERO BUT A ONE ATWO EARTH IDEALY A THREE THE CONCENTRATION OF SPERM OF COURSE IF IT'S HIGHER WITHIN THE EJACULATE NOW THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SPERM PER MILLILEADER OF EJACULATE IF THAT'S HIGHER THAN THERE'S A HIGHER PROBABILITY THAT ONE OF THOSE SPERM WILL FERTILIZE THE EGG ONETHING I DIDN'T MENTION BEFORE WHEN DISCUSSING THE PRODUCTION OF EGGS AN OVULATION AND I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SO I WILL NOW IS THAT MOST OFTEN ONLY ONE OVERY GIVE RISE TO AN OVULATING EGG IT'S IT HAPPENS BUT IT'S SOMEWHAT RARE FOR TWO MATURE EGGS ONE FROM EACH OVERY TO BE DEPLOY DURING A SINGLOVULATION A THERE'S A NAME FOR THAT WHEN IT OCCURS AND BOTH ARE FERTILIZED ITS CALLED FRATERNAL TWINS A IF A SINGLE EGG THAT OF COURSE COMES FROM A SINGLE OVERY IS FERTILIZE IN THE EGG SPLITS AND THAT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS FURTHER ALONG THE PROCESS OF FERTILIZATION AND DIFFERENTIATION OF THE EMBRYO WILL THEN WHAT YOU GET ARE IDENTICAL TWINS A THERE ARE OTHER INSTANCES THAT ARE A QUITE UNCOMMON IN WHICH YOU CAN GET FRATERNAL TWINS THROUGH OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES BEEN GENERAL TS THE WAY IT WORKS BUT ESENTURY WHAT HAPPENS IS ONE EGG FROM ONE OVERY THAT'S THE MOST COMMON OCCURRENTS THE SPERM ONCE EJACULATED INTO THE VAGENAL DUCT ARE GOING TO PASS THROUGH THE SERVICS AND THEN ARE GOING TO SWIM TOWARD THE EGG THE EGG COULD BE AT VERYING LOCATIONS ALONG THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ACCESS NOW THIS IS ACTUALLY A VERY IMPORTANT THING AND ACTUALLY GETS RIGHT DOWN TO A THE SAFETY OF BOTH THE POTENTUALLY DEVELOPING EMBRYO AND THE MOTHER THERE IS SOMETHING I REFER TO AS ECTOPIC PREGNANCY AND THAT'S WHEN THE PREGNANCY ACTUALLY OCURS WITHIN THE PHILOPIAN TUBES SO THE PRECISE LOCATION IN WHICH FERTILIZATION BETWEEN THE SPERM AN THE EGG OCCURS CAN VARY SOMEWHAT BUT I DEALY THE FERLIZES EGG IMPLANTS INTO TE ENDEMETRIUM WERE THEUNDERMETREAL LINING OF THE UTERUS AND DEVELOPS THERE AS SUPPOSED TO WITHIN THE PHILOPIAN TUBES WHICH IS SO CALLED ECTOPIC PREGNANCY NOW WHERE THE SPERM IN THE EGG ME EXACTLY CAN VARY AS I MENTION BEFORE BUT IN GENERAL THE FASTOR SWIMMING SPERM AND THE MORE FAR ALONG THE OPULATORY CHURCHECTORY THE EGG ARE THE HIGHER THE PROBABILITY OF A SUCCESSFUL FERTILIZATION BECAUSE OF THE PROXIMITY TO THE IMPLANTATION ZON OF THE UTERIS SO BASILY IT'S ALL A PROBABILITY'S GAME IT'S A PROBABILITIES GAME RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF SPERM CELLS THAT ENCOUNTER THE EGG AND WHERE THE EGG IS AND TERMS OF ITS OBULATORY CYCLE AND ALSO ITS POSITION WHERE IT IS IN THE OPULATORY CYCLE THE SPERM PERAMETERS I SHOULD SAY THE SEAMEN PERAMETERS AND EJACULATE PERAMETERS THAT MOST CLINITIONS WANT TO SEA IF YOU WERE TO GIVE A SPERM SAMPLE WOULD BE SOMEWHERE IN EXCESS OF FIFTEEN MILLION SPERM PER MILLA LEADER OF EJACULATE NOW THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION NOWDAYS TIT SEEMS TO BE A VERY POPULAR NEW STHEME TO TALK ABOUT DIMINISHING SPERM COUNTS NOW THE IDEA THAT A HUNDRED YEARS AGO OR MAYBEVEN THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO THE TYPICAL MALE EJACULATE CONTAINED A HUNDRED MILLION SPERM PER MILLEADER AND NOWADAYS ITS DOWN TO FIFTEEN TO TWENTY OR FIFTY AND INDEED SPERM COUNTS DO SEEM TO BE DECLINING AND THE EXACT REASONS FOR THAT ARE NOT CLEAR NO CONFESS O MELOBIT RELUCTANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE A THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE SAFETY OF E MPS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT HERE BUT THERE ORE SOME EXCELLENT DATA CONTAINED IN MEDANALSIES AND REVIEWS THAT I WILL PROVIDE LINKS TO AND THAT WILL TALK ABOUT IN MORE DETAIL IN A MINUTE THAT CORRELATE THE ADVENT OF SMART PHONES AND IN PARTICULAR CARRYING OF SMART PHONES IN THE POCKET WITH DIMINISHING SPERM COUNTS ALTHOUGH THERE ARE CERTAIN TO BE OTHER FACTORS THAT CAN EXPLAIN DIMINISHING SPERM COUNTS AS WELL O DOCTOR SHANA SWAN A FOR INSTANCE IS DONE BEAUTIFUL WORK DESCRIBING HOW THE FALLITES A AND THE B PIES AND SO CALED EN ENDICRIN DESTRUPTORS MIGHT BE DESTRUCTING SOME OF THE MILIU OF THE A SEMINIRFOROUS TUBULES TO THIS OD BE REDUCTIONS IN TESTOSTRONE END OR DESTRUPTIONS TO THE SURTHOLY CELLS AND ENDERGEMBINING PROTINE BROUGHT ABOUT BY ENTIRCRINE DESTRUPTORS SUCH AS ALLIES CONTAINED IN PESTISIDES AND CONTAINED ON PRINTED RECEIPT SOMETHINGS THAT SORT THERE ARE SOME DATA THAT THAT IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTING A SPERM COUNTS HOW MUCH SO IS STILL DEBATABLE THERE ARE ALSO QUITE GOOD DATA POINTIN THE FACT THAT BOTH THE HEAT RELATED AND THE NON HEAT RELATED IMPACT OF SMART PHONES AND LAP TOPS CONTAINED ON THE THE LAP ARE IMPACTING SPERM COUNT AND IN A NEGATIVE WAY AGAIN THERE'S GOING TO BE TREMENDOUS VARIATION IN THE CONCENTRATION OF SPERM FOR ONE INDIVIDUAL TO NEXT IT WILL VARY ACCORDING TO AGE AND A NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS IT WILL TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT LATER BUT IN GENERAL OF SOMEBODY IS WISHING TO CONCEIVE THEN CLINITIONS LIKE TO SEE A EJACULATE VOLUME OF MORE THAN TWO MILLILEADERS SO JACULATE VOLUME CAN BE ANYWHERE FROM ONE POINT FIVE TO FIVE MILL LEADERS AND THAT WILL STRONGLY BE DETERMINED BY HOW FREQUENT EJACULATION IS OCCURRING THERE'S A LOT THAT GOES IN TO A VALUATING THE QUALITY OF EJACULATE AND SPRM BUT BASICALLY THESE HUGE VARIATIONS THAT ARE OBSERVED OF ANYWHERE FROM FIFTEEN MILLION SPERM PERMILEADER OR IN SOME MALES WHO ARE NOT PRODUCING SPERM FOR WHATEVER REASON WE TALK ABOUT THOSE REASONS IN E LOBIT THE A AS LOW AS FIVE MILLION A SPERM PERMILE LEADER ALL THE WAY UP TO HUNDRED OR MAVIEN TWO HUNDRED MILLION SPERM PERMILL LEADER HUGE VARIATION THE CAUSE OF WHICH IS NOT ALWAYS CLEAR BUT IS CERTAINLY DETERMINED IN PART BY THE FREQUENCY OF EJACULATION SO BECAUSE THERE SO MANY VARIABLES IMPACTING WHY ONE MALE VERSES ANOTHER MALE OR EVEN THE SAME MALE ACROSS THE LIESPAN MIGHT HAVE VARIATIONS IN HIS A CONCENTRATION OF SPERM WITHIN THE EJACULATE LET'S TALK FOR A SECOND ABOUT FREQUENCY OF EJACULATION AS IT RELATES TO THE GOAL OF FERTILITY PERSAKE AS THT'S EALLY WHAT TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALL ABOUT SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT NEXT IS HOW PEOPLE CAN INCREASE THE PROBABILITY OF A SUCCESSFUL FERTILIZATION FOCASING BOTH ON THE COMPONENTS FROM THE MALE SIDE AND FROM THE FEMALE SIDE AND I'M MAINLY GOING TO COUCH THIS DISCUSSION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SO CALL NATURAL METHOD OF SEXUAL INTERCOURSE AND EJACULATION IN VEVO RIGHT WITHIN THE FEMALE BUT I WILL ALSO TOUCH ON SOME PARALLEL THEMES AS IT RELATES TO INVETRO FERTILIZATION AN INTREUTERANE IN SEMINATION A SO THE IDEA HERE IS THAT WE WANT THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF HIGH QUALITY SPERM THAT IS RAPIDLY FORWAD MOTILE SPERM THAT ARE OF THE CORRECT MOREPHOLOGY THAT IS SHAPE THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT OF MITACONDRA IN THE MIDREGION A WELL SHAPED HEAD SO ATS CANNOBE AN OVAL SHAPED HEAD THE TAIL IS GOING T BE A SINGLE TALE NOT MULTIPLE TALES THESE ARE CAN BE OF THE TWITCHER TYPE OF OF A OR IMMOTILE TYPE OF SPERM THAT ARE EITHER A TWITCHING IN PLACE OR OREN'T MOVING FORWARD ALL OF THOSE COMPONENTS ARE GOING TO BE ESSENTIAL FOR INCREASING THE PROBABILITY OF FERTILIZATION BUT OF COURSE THERE'S THE FEMALE SIDE OF IT TOO WHICH IS THAT OVULATION OCCURS ON JUST ONE DAY DURING THE MENSTRUAL OPULATORY CYCLE AND THAT EGG WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR FERTILIZATION FOR APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FOUR HOURS NOW KEEP IN MIND THAT THE SPERM CAN SURVIVE WITHIN THE VAGINAL DUCT AND WITHIN THE AREA ROUND THE SERVICS AND WITHIN THE UTERUS AND ALONG THE FEMALE RREPRODUCTIVE TRACT FOR ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO FIVE OR ITS EVEN BEEN DESCRIBED AS UP TO SEVEN DAYS BUT GENERALLY IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT THREE TO FIVE DAYS NOW MOST WOMEN CAN FIGURE OUT THE DAY OF THEIR OBULATION BY COUNTING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DAYS OF THEIR TYPICAL CYCLE THIS IS WHERE IT'S REALLY USEFUL TO HAVE A CYCLE TATS OF MORE OR LESS REGULAR DURATION OR RATHER OF MORE OR LESS REGULAR LENGTH SO AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IF SOMEBODY CYCLE IS TWENTY ONE DAYS OR TWENTY FIVE DAYS AND ITS TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY FIVE DAYS CONSISTENTLY OR EVEN THIRTY DAYS CONSISTENTLY THAT'S GOING TO BE A FAR BETTER CENARIO TO FAVOR FERTILIZATION THAN IF IT'S TWENTY DAYS ONE MONTH AND THEN TWENTY ONE DAYS THE NEXT MONTH WITHIN SUDDENLY YOU KNOW THIRTY DAYS AND THEN SUDENLY THIRTY FIVE DAYS THOSE VARYING DURATIONS OF THE OBULATORY CYCLE MAKE IT VERY HARD OVUCY TO TIME AND UNDERSTAND WHEN OVULATION IS GOING TO OCCUR SO REGULAR DURATION OBULATORY CYCLES ARE THE IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCE THERE THE IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCE BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THE EG IS ONLY AVAILABLE FOR FERTILIZATION FOR FEW DAYS THOSE SPERM CAN SURVIVE FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME WHICH LEADS TO THE ISSUE OF HOW OFTEN SHOLD COUPLES BE HAVING INTERCOURSE AND HEREA REFERRING SPECIFICALLY TO INTERCOURSE WITH EJACULATION HOW OFTEN SHOULD COUPLES BE HAVING INTERCOURSE AROUND THE TIME OF OVULATION IF THE SPECIFIC GOAL IS SUCCESSFUL FERTILIZATION OF THE EGG AND THE CREATION OF A BABY  THIS IS LEAVING ASIDE ALL ISSUES WHICH OF COURSE ARE INTERESTING ISSUES RELATED TO HOW OFTEN PEOPLE ARE HAVING INTERCOURSE WHETHER NOT THERE'S EJACULATION EVERY TIME THEY HAVE INTERCOURSE OR NOT FORSAKE OF PLEASURE OR SAKE OF PERBONDING AND PLEASURE OR FORSAKE OF ANY NUMBER OF OTHER PETENTIAL GOALS OF INTERCOURSE HERE I'M ONLY REFERRING TO INTERCOURSE AS IT RELATES TO THE GOAL OF FERTILIZATION OF THE EGG SO KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT SPERMATIGENESIS AND THE FACT THAT EJACULATE IS GOING TO CONTAIN A CERTAIN CONCENTRATION OF SPERM BUT THAT WITHIN THAT EJACULATE SOME OF THE SPERM WILL BE OLDER AND LESS HEALTHY IND SOME WILL BE OPTIMALLY MATURE AND SOME MIGHT EVEN BE A LITTLE BUT IMMATURE ALTHOUGH THERE'S A TENDENCY FOR THE IMMATURE SPIRM TO NOT HAVE YET EXITED THE SEMINIFERIST TUBULES A GONE INTO THE EPIDITIMUS AND VAST DEFERENCE BUT GIVIN THAT THE EJACULATE CONTAIN SPERM OF VARYING AGES AND THEREFOR VERYING QUALITY AND GIVEN THAT WITH EACH SUCCESSIVE EJACULATION IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THERE'S GOING TO BE A DECREASE IN THE CONCENTRATION OF SPERM PER MILLILEADER OF SEAMEN OF EJACULATE WE CAN MAKE SOME GOOD ARGUMENTS AS TO HOW OFTEN COUPLES SHOULD HAVE INTERCOURSE WITH EJACULATION AROUND THE TIME OF OBULATION IF THE GOAL IS TO FERTILIZE IF OPULATION OCCURS ON FOR INSTANCE DAY FOURTEEN OF A CYCLE HERE WERE USING THE KIND OF STANDARD AVERAGE OF TWENTY EIGHT DAYS THE CYCLE BUT FOR SOMEBY WITH THIRTY DAYS CYCLE YOU KNOW THET COULD BE A DAY FIFTEEN OR ON WITH THE SHORTER CYCLE COULD BE DAY TWELVE FOR INSTANCE BUT GIVEN A TWENTY EIGHT DAY AVERAGE CYCLE LET SAY OVULATION OCCURS ON DAY THIRTEEN OR ON DAY FOURTEEN AND TYPICALLY WOULD OCCUR ON DAY FOURTEEN OF A TWENTY EIGHT DAY CYCLE WILL THEN GIVEN HOW LONG SPERM CAN SURVIVE INSIDE OF THE WOMAN YOU MIGHT THINK THAT THE OPTIMAL STRAGY WOULD BE TO HAVE AS MUCH INTERCOURSE WITH EJACULATION IN THE THREE OR FOUR DAYS LEADING UP TO OPULATION HOPE THAT THESE SPERM IS SWIM AS FAR AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN AND WILL ENCOUNTER THE EGG JUST AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER IT OPULATES TURNS OUT THAT S NOT THE OPTIMAL STRAGY THE OPTIMAL STRAGY IS REALLY TO MAXIMIZE THE CONCENTRATION OF HEALTHY SPERM WITHIN EACH EJACULATE AND TO REALLY CENTERE THAT AROUND THE DAY OF OPULATION SO WHAT THIS INVOLVES GENERALLY WHITH THE TYPICAL RECOMMENDATION IS IS TO ABSTAIN FROM INTERCOURSE WITH EJACULATION ABOUT TWO OR THREE DAYS OUT FROM OVULATION AND THEN ON THE DAY PRIOR TO OPULATION AND ON THE DAY OF OPULATION TO ESSENTIALLY INTRODUCE AS MUCH SEAMEN AND EJACULATE INTO THE REPRODUCTIVE PATHWAY OF THE FEMALE AS POSSIBLE NOW THAT'S THE GENERAL RECOMMENDATION THAT THE OBIGIWIENDS AND THE EUROLOGIST THAT I SPOKE TO GAVE BUT YOU WILL ALSO HERE A DIFFERENT STRAGY IT'S ONLY SLIGHTLY DIFFEREN BUT THE DIFFERENCE DRAGY INVOLVES TRYING TO MAXIMIZE THE CONCENTRATION OF HEALTHY SPERM WITHIN EACH EJACULATE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WITH EACH SUBSEQUENT EJACULATION OVER ABOUT A TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE A DRAMATIC REDUCTION IN THE CONCENTRATION OF SPRM WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IF A COUPLE FOR INSTANCE WERE TO HAVE INTERCOURSE WITH EJACULATION MANY TIMES ON THE DAY PRIOR TO OPULATION YES THAT WILL INTRODUCE A LOT OF SPERM INTO THE REPRODUCTIVE PATHWAY THE FEMALE BUT WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT ON THE DAY OF OVULATION IF THEY WERE TO HAVE INTERCOURSE THE NUMBER OF HIGH QUALITY SPERM THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO THE EGG WILL BE GREATLY DIMINISHED AND IF NONE OF THE SPERM THAT WERE INTRODUCED IN THE DAY PRIOR MANSH A FERTILIZE THAT EGG WILL THEN ESSENTIALLY CHANCES ARE OFF THAT THERE WILL BE FERTILIZATION OR THERE GREATLY DIMINISHED RATHER IF THERE HAVING INTERCOURSE WITH EJACULATION ONCE OR TWICE ON THE DAY PRIOR TO OPULATION AND THEN A MAXIMUML NUMOR OF TIMES WITH EJACULATION ON THE DAY OF OPULATION THAT ITSELF CAN MAXIMIZE THE PROBABILITY OF FERTILIZATION SO WHIT STRAGY IS OPTIMAL SHOULD COUPLES HAVE AS MUCH INTERCOURSE WITH EJACULATION ON THE DAY PRIOR TO OVULATION END ON THE DAY OF OPULATION OR SHOULD THEY HAVE INTERCOURSE ON THE DAY PRIOR TO OPULATION BUT NOT SO FREQUENTLY THAT IT DIMINISHES THE CONCENTRATION OF SPERM AND THEN ALLOWS FOR INTERCOURSE WITH THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF EJACULATIONS ON THE DAY OF OVULATION YOU REALLY HEAR IT BOTH WAYS AND WHAT THIS REALLY BOILS DOWN TO IS FRANKLY THAT NOBODY KNOWS AND THE REASON NOBODY KNOWS IS THAT THERES TREMENDOUS VARIATION ONG MALES INTERMS OF THE ABSOLUTE CONCENTRATION OF SPERM PER MILLILEADER OF EJACULATE AND THE AMOUNT OF SPERM PEMILIE OF EJACULATE WITHIN A GIVEN TIME FRAME BUT WHAT EVERY ONE AGREES ON IS THAT A PERIOD OF ABSTINENCE RANGING FROM FORTY EIGHT TO SEVENTY TWO HOURS PRIOR TO AN EJACULATION INCREASES THE CONCENTRATION OF HIGH QUALITY SPERM WITHIN THAT FIRST EJACULATION OCCUR AFTER THE OBSTINENCE PERIOD EH SO AGAIN TO REITERATE IF ONE'S GOAL IS TO FERTILIZE THE EGG YOU WANT TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT MOST OFTEN THERE IS GOING TO BE A DRAMATIC DECLINE IN THE CONCENTRATION OF SPERM PER EJACULATE ANY TIME THOSE EJACULATIONS ARE OCCURRING WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SAY WITHIN TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF ONE ANOTHER NOW ALL OF THIS OF COURSE ALSO RELATES TO THE FEMALE BIOLOGY AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE WOMEN CAN PRECISELY IDENTIFY THE DAY IN TIMING OF HEROVULATION SOME WOMEN FEEL AS IF AND INDEED ARE VERY ACCURATE AT ESTIMATING THEIR TIME OF OVULATION TO WITHIN A COUPLE OF HOURS OR SOME WOMEN EVEN REPORT BEING ABLE TO FEEL THEIR ACTUAL OVULATION WHETHER NOT THEY ARE FEELING THE OVULATION ITSELF THE NE OR THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE AGRNAT ISN'T CLEAR  I CERTAINLY WOULD KNOWNEVER PRODUCED EGGS NOR OFHOVULATED AMAN IM CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO CONTEST THE IDEA THAT A WOMEN O CAN DO THAT I MEAN IT MAKE SENSE THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE A VERY O KEEN SO CALLED INTERROCEPTIVE AWARENESS IN AWARENESS OF THE CENSURY EVENTS WITHIN THEIR BODY AND WHILE OF COURSE THE OVERIES ARE NOT THOUGHT OF AS AN ORGAN THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SENSE WHAT'S GOING ON AN THERE IN TERMS O FEEL THERE ARE SENSORY ENDINGS WITHIN THE OVERY AND SO THE NOTION THAT A ONE COULD LITERALLY SENSE CHANGES WITHIN THEIR OVERY INCLUDING THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE EGG IS NOT ON OUTSIDE ON THE BOUNDS OF REASON AND IN FACT COULD LIKELY BE THE CASE NOW THAT SAID THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WOMEN WILL TRACT THEIR OBULATION ONE IS THE TEMPERATURE METHODS OF THEY'LL ACTUALLY MEASURE INTEROVAGIONAL TEMPERATURE ON THEIR LOOKING FOR CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE THAT ARE CONSISTENT AROUND THE TIME OF OBULATION WERE GOINGTO HAVE AN EXPERT GESSED ON AND OB GUIEN WHO CAN TELL US A LOT MORE ABOUT THE DETAILS IN NEWANCES OF THE TEMPERATURE METHOD YOU'LL SEA LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THIS ON LINE BIT THERE'S A LOT OF MIS UNDERSTANDING ABOUT IT AS WELL OTHER WOMEN WILL USE APS THAT TAKEINTO ACCOUNT EITHER THE TEMPERATURE INFORMATION IF THE ACQUIRING TEMPERATURE INFORMATION THAT'LL BE ENTERED INTO THE AP AS WELL AS MARKING THE ONSET OF MENSTRATION THE ONSET OF BLEEDING THEREFORE THE START OF THE OBULATORY CYCLE BECAUSE OF COURSE AS WE MENTION EARLY THAT MARKS DAY ONE OF THEIR CYCLE AND THEN AGAIN AND AGAIN YOU CAN SEE HOW REGULARITY OF CYCLE DURATION OR RELATIVE REGULARITY OF CYCLE DURATION REALLY FAVORS THIS WHOLE PROCESS OF BEING ABLE TO PREDICT WHEN ONE OPULATES AND FORTUNATELY IF THE GOAL IS FERTILIZATION THERE ARE SOME MARGINS FOR ERROR THAT ARE INTRODUCED BY THE FACT THAT THE SPERM CAN SURVIVE WITHIN THE FEMALE RE PRODUCTIVE TRACT FOR SOME PERIOD OF DAYS THEREBY REDUCING THE NEED FOR ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY ABOUT THE TIME OF OPULATION AND SO ON IN FACT IT'S PRETTY WELL KNOWN THAT AROUND THE TIME OF OBULATION A COUPLE OF THINGS HAPPEN EARLIER WE TALKE ABOUT ONE THING WHICH IS THEREIS AN INCREASE IN LABIDO JUST PRIOR TO OPULATION THIS RELATES TO IN PART AND INCREASE IN SOME OF THE ANDROGENS THINGS LIKE D  C E BUT ALSO TO STOSTRONE AND SOME RELATED ANDROGENS THEY CAN INCREASE LEBIDO BOTH IN MALES AND FEMALES AND CHANGES TO THE REPRODUCTIVE PATHWAY THE FEMALE IN PARTICULAR A CHANGE IN THE P H THAT IS THE RELATIVE ACIDITY VERSES BASIC NATURE OF THE MUCOSAL LINING NEAR THE SERVICS AND ALSO VAGIONAL SECRETIONS SUCH THAT AROUND THE TIME OF OBULATION THE ENTIRE MILU OF THE VAGINA AND THE SERVIC AND THE LOCATIONS IN WHICH FERTILIZATION CAN OCCUR AND CERTAINLY IN WHICH THE SPERM ARE SWIMMING TOWARDS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FERTILIZATION IS SHIFTED TO SUPPORT SPERM MOTILITY AND HEALF IN OTHER WORDS THE ONE OF THE BEST ENVIRONMENTS FOR SPERM TO SURVIVE IS GOING TO BE WITHIN THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE PATHWAY ITSELF AND AS LONG AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VAGINAL SECRETIONS AND MUCUS IT'S IMPORTAN TO POINT OUT THAT IN NUMBER OF COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE LUBRICANS CAN ACTUALLY BE DETRIMENTAL FOR SPERM HEALTH EVEN IF THEY DON'T CONTAIN SPERMATICIDE SO THIS IS SOMETHING YOUL WANT TO DISCUSS WITH YOUR OB GI YENN OR CERTAINLY IF YOUR MALE YOU COULDALSO DISCUSS THUS WITH YOUR EUROLOGISTS AND YOUR PARTNERS OBI G YENN A LOT OF THE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE LURI CAN CONTAIN CHEMICALS THAT WHILE THEY MAY FAVORABLY CHANGE THE CONSISTENCY OR THE VISCOSITY OF THE VAGIONAL PATHWAY FOR PURPOSES OF INTERCOURSE CERTAINLY MAY NOT BE THE MOST FAVORABLE FOR MAINTAINING THE HEALTH OF THE SPERM IN THE MOTILITY THE SPERM SO AGAIN HERE WERE TALKING ABOUT INTERCOURSE ONLY IN THE CONTEXT OF TRYNAMAXIMIZE FERTILIZATION AND I SHOULD MENTION THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN LUBRICANTS THAT ARE MORE CONDUCIVE TO THE SPERM ENVIRONMENT BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT OU REALLY WANT TO TALK YOUR OB G YAN ABOUT OR AT LEAST READ UP ABOUT IF YOUR INTEREST IS IN TRYING TO FERTILIZE AND DEVELOP AN EMBRIO SO WE COVERD THE OPTIMAL STRATEGIES FOR HOW OFTEN COUPLES SHOULD HAVE INTERCOURSE WITH EJACULATION AROUND THE TIME OF OVULATION IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE PROBABILITY THAT SUCCESSFUL FERTILIZATION AND ULTIMATELY PREGNANCY WILL OCCUR WHAT WE HAVEN'T COVERED YET HOWEVER IS HOW LONG COUPLES SHOULD APPLY THAT METHOD OVER TIME IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE SUCCESSFUL FERTILIZATION AND PREGNANCY NOW OF COURSE IF A COUPLE DECIDE THAT THEY WANT TO CONCEIVE AND THEY APPLY THAT METHOD OR ANY OTHER METHOD FOR INSTANCE AND THEY A CHIEV FERTILIZATION AND A SUCCESSFUL PREGNANCY THE VERY FIRST MONTH THAT THEY TRY WELL THEN THERE'S NO OTHER WORK TO DO AT LEAST UNTIL THAT CHILD IS BORN AND IF IN ONLY IF THEY DECIDE THEY WANT HAVE MORE CHILDREN HOWEVER MANY COUPLES FIND THAT THEY DO NOT CONCEIVE IN THE FIRST MONTH OF TRYING EVEN W HEN THEY APPLY THE OPTABLE METHODS AND EVEN IF THEIR AGE AND EVERY OTHER FACTOR RELATED TO EGG QUALITY AND SPERM QUALITY IS OPTIMIZED NOW I THINK IT'S THE RARE INSTANCE IN WHICH EGG QUALITY AND SPIRM QUALITY ARE OPTIMIZE IN FACT THE WORD OPTIMAL AND OPTIMIZATION AND OPTIMIZED S LOPET MISLEADING IN GENERAL BECAUSE NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHAT THAT IS BUT OF COURSE THERE IS AN IDEAL THERE'S A PERFECT STANDARD TO WHICH EVERYONE WOULD LIKE TO ACHIEVE BUT OF COURSE WE ALL ENTER THE PICTURE WHICH GENETIC VARIABLES ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES AND SO FORTH MANY OF WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT BECAUSE YOU CAN IN FACT A JUST THEM IN THE DIRECTION TAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO IMPROVE SPERM ANEGG QUALITY BUT MOST PEOPLE SIMPLY WILL NOT SUCCEED IN ACHIEVING A SUCCESSFUL FERTILIZATION THE FIRST MONTH THAT THEY TRY NOW THERE IS A TRUTH THAT GOVERNS HOW MANY TRIES IT OUGHT TO TAKE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE SUCCESSFUL FERTILIZATION AN ULTIMATELY PREGNANCY AND ITS VERY AGE DEPENDENT AND IN PARTICULAR ITS DEPENDENT ON THE AGE OF THE MOTHER BECAUSE THE AGE AND QUALITY OF THE EGG WHILE IT'S NOT THE ONLY FACTOR IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST DETERMINING FACTORS AND WHETHER NOT SUCCESSFUL FERTILIZATION OCCURS AND AS WOMEN AGE THE QUALITY OF THE EGGS TENDS TO DIMINISH OVER TIME LARGELY DUE TO CHANGES IN THE MITOCONDRAL FUNCTION AND THE SPINDLE THAT PULLS THE CHROMOZOMES APART ALTHOUGH THERE COULD BE OTHER FACTORS INVOLVED AS WELL NOW BEFORE CONTINUING ANY FURTHER I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WHOLE LANGUAGE AROUND EGG QUALITY AND SPERM QUALITY IS NOT THE GREATEST LANGUAGE BECAUSE IT'S ENTIRELY SUBJECTIVE AND YET THE WORD QUALITY IN THESE INSTANCES IS REALLY THER TO EXPLAIN A BROAD VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT CAN IN FACT BE MEASURED THINGS LIKE THE NUMBER OF PHOLICALS THAT ARE DEPLOYED EACH MONTH IN A WOMAN'S OPULATION OR THE NUMBER OF MOTILE SPERM ARE THE NUMBER OF MOREPHOLOGICALLY THAT IS CORRECTLY SHAPED SPERM IN THE MALE AND SO FORTH SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EGG QUALITY OF SPIRM QUALITY WERE REALLY REFERRING TO IN AMALGUM OF DIFFERENT FEATURES RELATED TO THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF OVULATION LEADING TO SUCCESSFUL FERTILIZATION WERE THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF SPERM RELATED TO WHETHER NOT THEY CAN ARRIVE IN DELIVER THEIR DEANA CONTENCS AND SO FORTH SO I WILL USE THE WORDS EGG QUALITY AND SPIRM QUALITY JUST AS GENERAL THEMES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF THE CLINITIONS USE BUT I DO UNDERSTAND THAT ITS ELOBIT OF A LOADED TERM IN BOTH INSTANCES AND IT DOESN'T RELATE TO ANY ONE SPECIFIC PERAMETER PERSAY SO GETTING BACK TO THIS ISSUE OF HOW LONG COUPLE SHOULD TRY ACCORDING TO THE AGE OF THE FEMALE AND PERHAPS ALSO THE AGE OF THE MALE WELL MOST OF THE DATA THAT HAVE BEEN COLLECTED RELATE TO THE AGE OF THE FEMALES I MENTION BEFORE AND WHAT WERE ABOUT TO DISCUSS IS WITHIN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE DESCRIBED AS WHAT'S CALLED FACUNDIBILITY WHICH IS THE AMOUNT OF TIME OVER WHICH A GIVEN COUPLE NEEDS TO ATTEMPT TO CONCEVE  COURSE BY HAVING INTERCOUSE WITH EJACULATION AROUND THE TIME OF OPULATION IT ASSUMES THAT ALL TE OTHER THINGS ARE BEING DONE CORRECTLY AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THERE'S A STRONG AGE DEPENDENT EFFECT THAT LARGELY RESTS ON THE AGE OF THE EGG THAT IS OF THE FEM MALE ND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT FOR FEMALES THIRTY YEARS OLD OR YOUNGER IF THEY HAVE INTERCOURSE WITH EJACULATION AROUND THE TIME OF OBULATION SAY ON THE DAY BEFORE AND ON THE DAY OF OBULATION AND THERE COULD BE OTHER INTERCOURSE WITH EJACULATION ROUND THAT TIME AS WELL ON AVERAGE THAT WILL RESULT IN A SUCCESSFUL FERTILIZATION IN PREGNANCY ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT OF THE TIME ON THE FIRST MONTH OF ATTEMPTING THE FIRST OBULATION CYCLE NOW IF FERTILIZATION AND PREGNANCY OCCURS GREAT THEY'LL BE AT LEAST ENINE MONTH LAG UNTIL THEY DECIDE WHETHER NOT THEY WANT TO TRY AND CONCEIVE AGAIN HOWEVER MOST COUPLES EVEN IF THE WOMAN IS THIRTY YEARS OLD OR YOUNGER WILL NOT SUCCESSFULLY CONCEIVE ON THAT FIRST ATTEMPT AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE PROBABILITY IS NOT A HUNDRED PER CENT IT'S TWENTY PER CENTS SO EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE TIME THEY SIMPLY WILL NOT CONCEIVE WHICH MEANS THAT THEY HOPEULLY WILL TRY AGAIND THE VERY NEXT MONTH AND IF THEY SUCCESSFULLY CONCEIVE GREAT AND IF THEY DON'T THEN THEY OUGHT TO TRY AGAIN THE NEXT MONTH THE NEXT MONTH AND SO FORTH NOW THE TYPICAL ADVICE THAT AN OB GI Y EN WOULD GIVE YOU IS THAT FOR A WOMAN THIRTY YEARS OR YOUNGER AND LEAVING A SIDE THE AGE OF THE FATHER BUT STILL ASSUMING THAT EGG QUALITY AND SPERM QUALITY ARE SUFFICIENTLY HIGH TO ACHIEVE FERTILIZATION THAT THE COUPLE SHOULD OR IF THE WOMAN'S TRY TO HAVE KIS ALONE THE WOMAN SHOULD ATTEMPT TO CONCEIVE OVER F THE PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS WHY WILLIF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IF THERE'S A TWENTY PER CENT CHANCE IN THE FIRST MONTH AND IT'S UN SUCCESSFUL WILL THEN ON THE SECOND MONTH THEY'LL ALSO BE A TWENTY PER CENT CHANCE ON THE THIRD MONTH ALSO A TWENTY PER CENT CHANCS WHAT I'M DESCRIBING HERE IS WHAT OBVIOUSLY IS INDEPENDENT PROBABILITIES THAT IS IF YOU WERE TO FLIPACOIN AND THE PROBABILITY OF GETTING HEADS IS FIFTY PER CENT THE PROBABILITY OF GTTING TAILS IS FIFTY PERCENT OF COURSE YOU DON'T EXPECT THAT THE PREVIOUS FLIP HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE RESULT THATYOU'L GET ON THE SUBSEQUENT FLIP THAT'S WHAT INDEPENDENT PROBABILITIES ARE HOWEVER WHEN IT COMES TO FOR CUNDIBILITY WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING WHICH IS CALLED CUMULATIVE PREGNANCY RATE WHICH IS NOT REALLY INDEPENDENT PROBABILITIES NOW WHY WOULD THAT BE WHY WOULD IT BE THAT IF YOU DID NOT SUCCESSFULLY CONCEIVE IN THE FIRST MONTH OF TRIME THAT BY SIMPLY TRYING AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN THE PROBABILITY OF CONCEIVING WOULD INCREASE WHELL THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THIS WHOLE BUSINESS OF FERTILIZATION IS NOT JUST ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENIG WITHTHE EGG IT'S ALSO ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH AE SPIRM SO THERE ARE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT EVENTS RELATED TO THE BIOLOGY OF THE EGG IN THE BIOLOGY THE SPIRM WHICH YOU ARE NOW VERY FAMILIAR WITH FROM EVERYTHING IAVE TALKED ABOUT UP UNTIL NOW AND THERE A BUNCH OF CHANCE EVENTS FOR INSTANCE THAT THE SPERM WON'T ACTUALLY ARRIVE AT THE EGG IN TIME OR THAT THE EGG WON'T ARRIVE AT THE SPERMIN TIME BECAUSE OF COURSE IT'S A BY DIRECTIONAL MIGRATION OF THOSE TWO CELTIPES OR THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON FERTILIZATION WON'T OCCUR SO T REALLY TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE CUMULATIVE PREGNANCY RATE OVER TIME IS THE FACT THAT THERE RE MULTIBLE PROBABILITIES AT WORK AND YES THOSE ARE SOMEWHAT INDEPENDENT IN THE CENTS THAT THE BY ALOGY OF THE SPIRM DOESN'T REALLY STRICTLY DEPEND ON THE BIOLOGY OF THE EGG AT LEAST NOT UNTIL THEY MEET AND FERTILIZE BUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF PREGNANCY DEPENDS ON THOSE INDEPENDENT PROBABILITIES WHICH MAKES THIS A CUMULATIVE PREGNANCY RATE NOW IF ANY OF THAT IS CONFUSING WHAT IT BASELY MEANS IS THAT FOR THE EGG IN THE SPIRM TO MEET AND TO FERTILIZE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT EVENTS THAT CARRY SOME INTENTIONALITY WRITE THE SPIRM SWIMS TOWARDS THE EGG AND SO FOR THE EGG WE DOESN'T HAVE A A PERSONALITY IN THERE AT LEAST NOT YET BUT IT A CORDING WHAT WANTS TO BE FORTILIESWRIGHT AT IT IN PRINCIPAL RECEPTIVE TO FERTILIZATION WELL IN ORDER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN THEREARE GOING TO BE SOME EVENTS RELATED TO CHANCE THAT COULD LIMIT THE ABILITY FOR THAT TO HAPPEN AND THEREWILL BE OTHER EVENTS DICTATE BY THEIR BIOLOGY OF THOSE TWHO SELL TYPES TED ARE DRIVING THAT EVENT TO HAPPEN THAT AR BISING THE EVENT TO YES HAPPEN AND SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE TI ABOUT CUMULATIVE PREGNANCY RATE IS HOW MUCH OF THE BIOLOGY OF THE WOMAN IS SCUWE TOWARDS FERTILIZATION TO BE LIKELY TO OCCUR NOCE SO TO MAKE THIS VERY SIMPLE ALL WE NEED TO KNOW IS THAT FOR WOMEN THIRTY YEARS OLD OR YOUNGER BECAUSE THE PROBABILITY OF GETTING PREGNANT ON ANY ONE ATTEMPT TO CONCEIVE IS TWENTY PER CENT WELL THEN IF THAT DOESN'T OCCUR THE FIRST TIME THEN SHE SHOULD SIMPLY REPEAT THAT AT LEAST FIVE AND PROBABLY SIX TIMES BEFORE DECIDING TO GO TO AN OB G WY ENN AND CONCLUDE THAT THERE SOMETHING GOING ON EITHER WITH THE EGG OR OF COURSE IT COULD BE WITH THE SPER PEGB BECAUSE TWENTY TIMES FIVE IS A HUNDRED SO WHERE TIME ACCUMULATIVE PER CENTS O TWENTY FORTY SIXTY EIGHTY A HUNDRED AND HE SIX MONTH THERE WOULD TAKE YOU TO A HUNDRED TWENTY PER CENT AM WHICH IS A A DIFFEREN THING ALTOGETHER BUT IN GENERAL THAT'S WHY O B G WY ENDS WILL TELL THEIR FEMALE PATIENTS LOOK IF YOU'RE SETTING OUT TO CONCEIVE TRY FOR ABOUT FIVE OR SIX MONTHS AND IF YOU'RE NOT SUCCESSFUL COME BACK AND SEIMING NOW FOR WOMEN WHO ARE AGE THIRTY ONE TO THIRTY THREE THE PROBABILITY OF CONCEIVING IN THAT FIRST MONTH DROPS TO ABOUT EIGHTEEN PER CENT SO WOMEN IN THAT AGE RANGE AND THEIR PARTNERS SHOULD CERTAINLY TRY IND CONCEIVE NATURALLY OVER A PERIOD OF SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS IN ORDER TO GET TO THAT HUNDRED PER CENT CUMULATIVE PROBABILITY AND THEN FOR WOMEN WHO ARE AGE THIRTY FOUR TO THIRTY SEVEN THE PROBABILITY OF CONCEIVING IN THAT FIRST MONTH OF T OF TRYING AND CERTAINLY EVERY MONTH THEREAFTER IS ABOUT ELEVEN PER CENT SO WHEN THE AGE OF THE WOMAN STARTS EXTENDING OUT TO ABOUT THIRTY FOUR OR THIRTY FIVE YEARS OLD THEN THE TYPICAL ADVICE OF THE O B G WY ENNE IS GOING TO BE TO A TEMPT TO CONCEIVE OVER A PERIOD OF ABOUT NINE MONTHS TO A YEAR BE FOR DECIDING TO TAKE SOME SORT OF MEDICAL INTERVENTION AND THEN AT COURSE AS THE AGE OF THE WOMAN INCREASES SO TWO DOES THE QUALITY OF THE EGGS GO DOWN NOW THAT'S NOT TRUE FOR EVERY WOMAN THERE ARE MANY WOMEN WHO IN THEIR LATE THIRTIES AND FORTIES AND EVEN EALLY FIFTIES HAVE SUCCESSFULLY CONCEIVED HEALTHY CHILDREN ALTHOUGH THE PROBABILITY OF THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF IT DROPS SUBSTANTIALLY SO FOR INSTANCE FOR WOMEN WHO ARE AGE THIRTY EIGHT TO THIRTY NINE THE PROBABILITY OF A SUCCESSFUL CONCEPTION BY NATURAL CONCEPTION INTERCOURSE WITH HEJACULATION IS GOING TO BE ABOUT FIVE PER CN ENT RIGHT SO IT'SRALLY DROP TO A QUARTER OF WHAT IT WAS WHEN THAT WOMAN WAS THIRTY AGAIN THESE ARE AVERAGES ONLY WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WHILE IT MEANS THAT IF YOU ARE AGE THIRTY EIGHT OR OLDER CHANCES ARE THAT YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GO TO YOUR OB G Y ENN RIGHT AT THE OUTSET OF YOUR DESIRE TO CONCEIVE AND ASK WHAT YOU CAN DO TO IMPROVE EGG QUALITY OTHERWISE IF YOU WERETO EXTEND THE MATH OUT RIGHT WE KNOW THAT IF YOUR AGED THIRTY OR YOUNGER TWENTY PER CENT CHANCE IN ANY ONE GIVEN MONTH THAT MEANS ABOUT FOR TO SIX MONTHS OF TRYINE WHALL YOU CAN SIMPLY MULTIPLY THAT TIMES FOUR OR FIVE FOR SOME ONE IN THEIR LATE THIRTIES OR EARLY FORTIES AND SO WHAT YOU REALLY TALKING ABOUT A SEVERAL YEARS OF TRYING AND OF COURSE WHAT'S HAPPENING DURING THOSE SEVERAL YEARS THE WOMAN IS GETTING OLDER AND AS A CONSEQUENCE THE QUALITY OF THE EGGS IS DECLINING EVEN FURTHER SO IF YOU ARE YOU KNOW THIRTY FIVE THIRTY SIX YEARS OLD IT MIGHT NOT BE ENTIRELY UNREASONABLE TO TALK YOUR OB G W ANN RIGHT AT THE OUTSET OF DESIRING TO CONCEIVE BUT YOU COULD ALSO JUST TAKE THE APPROACH OF TRING TO CONCEIVE NATURALLY FOR ABOUT A YEAR OR A YEAR AND A HALF BEBEFORE DECIDING TO DO THAT KEEPING IN MIND THAT ALL THE WHILE YOU CAN'T STOP TIME SO BIOLOGICAL TIME AN AGING IS GOING TO OCCUR IN THE BACK TROP BUT HOPEFULLY THIS DESCRIPTION OF CUMULIV OF PREGNANCY RATE MAKE CENTS AGAIN THE IDEAS THAT WHILE IT'S TRUE THAT EVERY SINGLE MONTH THERE'S AN INDEPENDENT CHANCE OF THE WOMAN GETTING PREGNANT AND THAT CHANCE IS DROPPING FROM ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT AT AGE THIRTY OVER TIME TO ABOUT REALLY ONE TO THREE PER CENT FOR WOMEN FORTY OR OLDER THERE'S ALSO THIS NOTION OF CUMULATIVE PROBABILITY WHICH INVOLVES MULTIPLE BIOLOGICAL EVENTS IN BOTH THE EGG AND THE SPERM THAT HAVE TO CONVERGE IN TIME AND SPACE IN ORDER FOR SUCCESSFUL FERTILIZATION TO OCCUR AS LONG AS WE'RE ON THIS TOPIC I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF MISCARRIAGE AND MISCARRAGES CAN ARISE FROM VAVARIETY OF SOURCES THEY CAN ARISE FROM GENETIC DEFECTS THAT CAN ARISE FROM ISSUES IN THE MILL EU OF THE UTERISTS THAT CAN ARISE FROM ISSUES WITH A SPERM FOR THAT MATTER RIGHT IT WE REALLY DON'T WANT TO PUT ALL THE WEIGHT AND ALL THE A RESPONSIBILITY ON THE EGG THIS IS ALWAYS AN EGG SPERM DYNAMIC AND WHEN I SAYGGSPIRM DYNAMIC NOW HOPEFULLY THAT CALLS TO MINE THE HUGE LIBRARY OF INFORMATION THAT WE'VE BEN COVERING UP UNTIL NOW ABOUT A CROME ISALMOS SEGREGATION AND THE COMING TOGETHER OF THESE DIFFERENT CELL TYPES AND THEIR GYNETIC INFORMATION ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STEPS WITHIN THE PROCESS OF FERTILIZATION LEADING UP TO PREGNANCY CAN LEAD TO MISCARRIAGE HOWEVER THE PROBABILITY OF MISCARRIAGE GREATLY INCREASES AS A FUNCTION OF THE AGE OF THE EGG AND THE BASIC NUMBERS ON THIS ARE THAT FOR WOMEN WHO ARE THIRTY FIVE YEARS OR OLDER ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF SUCCESSFUL FERTILIZATIONS LEAD TO MISCARRIAGES NOW WHEN THOSE MISCARRIAGES OCCUR DURING PREGNANCY CAN BE HIGHLY VARIABLE SOMETIMES IT'S WITHIN THE FIRST TRIMUSTER SOMETIMES IT COULD BE LATER BUT THE PROBABILITIES ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT THAT PROBABILITY INCREASES GREATLY OVER TIME SUCH THAT BY THE TIME WOMEN ARE IN THEIR EARLY FORTY SO FORTY OR OLDER THE PROBABILITY OF MIS S CARRIAGE AFTER A SUCCESSFUL FERTILIZATION IS GOING TO BE ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT AND THIS COULD BE DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS AS I MENTION BEFORE BUT ONE COMMON REASON IS THAT THERE CAN BE CHROMAZOMAL ABNORMALITIES AND THAT COULD BE RELATED TYPICALLY TO THE SEGREGATION OF THE EGG WHEN HALF OF THE CHROMAZOMES IN THAT EGG ARE REMOVED TAKING IT FROM DIPLOID TO HAPLOID YO RECALL IS THAT LITWLE POLAR BODY WHICH IS THE REMOVAL OF THE CHROMAZOMES IT'S EJECTED FROM THE EGG TAT WILL EVENTUALLY OPULAT AND SOMETIMES NOT ALL THE CHROMAZOMES THAT ARE WERE SPOSED TO THE EJECTED IN THAT POLAR BODY ARE EJECTED AND CONSEQUENCE THEIR MULTIBLE CHROMAZOMES OR DUPLICATIONS OF CROMAZOMES THINGS LIKE TRISTOMES SOMETIMES TOO MANY CHROMAOZOMES MOVE AWAY AND THEIR ACTUAL REMOVAL OF ENTIRE CHROMAOZOMS MEANING BOTH STRANDS SO THAT YOU HAVE CHROMAZOMAL DELESIONS AND IN THAT CASE TYPICALLY FERTILIZATION WON'T OCCUR BUT THERE ARE INSTANCES IN WHICH FERTILIZATION WILL OCCURS A WOMAN WILL GET A POSITIVE PREGNANCY TEST OR PERIODS WILL STOP AND THEY THE COUPLE WILL THINK THAT THEIRE ADVANCING ALONG A THE STEPS TO A SUCCESSFUL PREGNANCY AND THEN THEIR WILL BE SADLY A MISCARRIAGE MANY MANY TIMES THOSE MISCARRIAGES ARE THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE FACT THAT WHEN THERE ARE EXTRA CHROMAZOMES THERE OR THERE ARE TOO FEW CHROMAZOMES PRESENT THAT EMBRYOGENISIST CAN SIMPLY NOT PROGRESS IN A HEALTHY WAY A THERE ARE SOME INSTANCES IN WHICH ALL OF THE CHROMAZOMES AND ALL THE CHROMAZOMA ARRANGEMENTS ARE PERFECTLY NORMAL AND MISCARRIAGES CAN STILL OCCUR I'M GOING TO DO A FUTURE EPISODE ABOUT PREGNANCY AND EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT WHERE WE WILL GET INTO THIS MORE DEEPLY BUT JUST UNDERSTAND THAT THE FREQUENCY OF MISCARRIAGES INCREASES DRAMATICALLY AFTER ABOUT AGE THIRTYEFORE AND THEN CONTINUES TO INCREASE DRAMATICALLY A EXTENDING WELL OUT UNTIL THE FORTIES NOW VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING AND PREDICTING FERTILITY AND FCUNDABILITY THIS WORD THAT DESCRIBES THE PROBABILITY OF GETTING PREGNANT ON A GIVEN TRY AND OVER TIME IS TRYING TO ADDRESS HOW QUOTIN FERTILE A WOMAN IS AND IMPORTANTLY HOW QUOTEN Q FERTILE A MAILE IS AND WILL TALK ABHAT THE MAILSIDE IN A MOMENT BUT WHEN TRYING TO ADDRESS HOW FERTILE A WOMAN IS OF COURSE AGES GOING TO BE ONE OF THE MAJOR FACTORS BUT JUST ONE FACTOR ARE WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT AGE DETERMINES THE LIKELIHOOD OF A SUCCESSFUL PREGNANCY IF THE INTERCOURSE AND EJACULATION IS BEING CARRIED OUT AT THE CORRECT TIMES AND WITH VIABLE SPIRM CAPABLE OF FERTILIZING EGGES AND THEN OF COURSERS THE ISSUE OF EGG QUALITY BUT IN GENERAL MOST WOMEN WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW FERTILE THEY ARE AS A FUNCTION OF THEIR AGE I AND I ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TOPICS IN THIS WHOLE SPACE AROUND FERTILITY THAT ISN'T OFTEN DISCUSSED OR AT LEAST ISN'T OFTEN DISCUSSED UNTIL WOMEN ARE IN THERE LATE THIRTIES ARE FORTIES WHEN OFTEN TIMES THEY WILL LOOK BACK AND WISH THAT EITHER THEY HAD FROZEN THEIR EGGS OR THEY HAD FROZEN FERTILIZED EMBRYOS WHICH IS A  WHOLTHING UNTO ITSELF AND WE TALK ABOUT THAT WHEN WE HAVE AN AN EPISODE ON IN VITROFERTLIZATION IN MORE DEPTH BUT THERE IS A FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY OR SET OF WAYS THAT WOMEN CAN DETERMINE THERE BASIC LEVEL OF FERTILITY LEAVING ASIDE A LOT OF THE DETAILED ISSUES ABOUT THE QUALITY OF EGGS AND SO FORTH ONE THING THAT YOU ALREADY LEARN IS THAT THERE'S THIS VAULT THERE'S THIS RESERVE THAT WE CALL THE OVARIAN RESERVE AND THAT EACH MONTH A CERTAIN NUMBER OF FOLICALS LEAVE THAT RESERVE AND THERE'S THE OPPORTUNITY BASED ON THE OVULATION OF A SINGLE EGG TO FERTILIZE THAT EGG AND FOR THE WOMEN TO GET PREGNANT AN ONE THING THAT WE KNOW FOR SURE IS THAT THE SIZE OF THE POPULATION THAT'S RELEASED FROM THAT VAULT EACH MONTH HAS A VERY STRONG POSITIVE CORRELATION WITH THE SIZE OF THE RESERVE IN THE VAULT ITSELF KA SO THE WEIGH TO THING ABOUT THIS PERHAPS IS THAT THE VAULT IS LIKE A BANK ACCOUNT HAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THIS CASE EGGS IN IT AND YOU COULD IMAGINE IF SOME ONE'S REASONABLY LOGICAL THAT IF THEY HAVE MORE MONEY IN THEIR BANK ACCOUNT THAN TE'RE GOING TOE WITHDRAW A LARGER AMOUNT EACH MONTH THAN IF THEY HAVE A SMALL AMOUNTH EACH MONTH IF THE IDEA IS TO MAKE THAT VAULT THAT BANK OF EGGS AVAILABLE TO THEM OVER THE LONGEST PERIOD OF TIME AND INDEED BIOLOGIES PRETTY SMART IT DOESN'T DEPLOIY OR RELEASE YOU HALF THE FOLICALS IN ONE MONTH AND THEN JUST SLOWLY TRICKOLOUT THE REMAINDER OF FOLICALS NOW THAT'S NOT HOUT WORKS WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT OF COURSE IN YOUNGER WOMEN SO SAY IN THEIR LEIGHTEEN TWENTIES AND THIRTIES THE OVARIAN RESERVE IN THE VAULT IS GOING TO HAVE MORE EGGS IN IT AND THE NUMBER OF FOLICALS AND EGGS THAT LEAVE THAT VAULT EACH MONTH IS GOING TO BE QUITE HIGH SO ONE WAY TO EVALUEIGHT HOW QUOTEN QUFERTILE YOU ARE AGAIN JUST ONE WAY IS TO GO TO YOUR OBGUYEN AND SAY THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW MANY FOLICALS YOU HAVE IN A GIVEN MONTH IN OF COURSETHEY LOOK AT THEM ON BOTH SIDES IN BOTH OVERIES AND FOR INSTANCE IF A OMEN HAS YOU KNOW JUST TWO OR THREE FOLICALS THAT ARE OUT EACH MONTH WELL THEN THE ASSUMPTION AGAIN IT'S JUST IN ASSUMPTION BUT THE ASSUMPTION THAT'S PRETTY GOOD BECAUSE THERE'S THIS POSITIVE CORRELATION THAT GENERALLY CURVES IS THAT THAT OVARYING RESERVE THAT THE NUMBER OF EGGS IN THE VAULT IS FAIRLY LOW COMPARED TO SOME ONE WHO SAY HAS TWENTY FOLICALS OR THIRTY FOLICALS EACH MONTH N THAT'S THE TYPICAL TREND AGAIN THESE ARE AVERAGES AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO NOT GET ATTACHED TO ANY ONE NUMBER HERE AGAIN THESE ARE AVERAGES SO FOR INSTANCE THERE ARE WOMEN WHO ONLY DEPLOY FIVE FOLICALS AND EGGS EACH MONTH FROM OUT OF THEIR OVARIAN VAULT BUT WHO FIND THEMSELVES TO BE VERY FERTILE IN THERE CULD BE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS TO EXPLAIN THAT OTHER WOMEN WILL HAVE TWENTY OR THIRTY EGGS AND FOLICALS THAT LEAVE THAT VAULT THE OVARIAN RESERVE EACH MONTH AND THEY WILL HAVE A HARDER TIME GETTING PREGNENT FOR ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REASONS BUT IN GENERAL THE MORE EGGS AND FOLICALS THAT LEAVE THE VAULT EACH MONTH THE HIGHER NUMBER OF EGGS THAT ARE STILL IN RESERVE MEANING THE GREATER AMOUNT OF TIME OVER WHICH A GIVEN WOMAN COULD STILL ATTEMPT TO HAVE SUCCESSFUL FERTILIZATIONS NOW THIS UM SMALL COLLECTION OF POLIALS AND EGGS THAT ARE RELEASED EACH MONTH ACTUALLY HAS A NAME THETRE CALLED ANTRALFOLCALS THESE ARE SMOLPOLICALS THEY TIN TO BE ABOUT TWO DENINE MILLIMETERS ACROSS THE WAY THESE ARE ANALYZED OR MEASURED IS WOMAN WILL GO INTO THE OB G WY AN OFFICE AN BY ULTRASOUND TYPICALLES THERERE SOME LOCAL ANASESIA BUT ITS NOT OFTEN A GENERAL INASISIA BUT BY LOCAL IN ASISIA SOMETIMES NO ANASISIA THEY WILL E SENTUALLY COUNT THE NUMBER OF FOLICALS THAT ARE PRESENT IN EACH SIDE ON OVERY ON THE LEFT AN THE OVERY ON THE RIGHT AND GIVE A WOMAN SOME SENSE OF HOW MANY POLICALS SHE HAS AND TYPIALLY THIS IS DONE OVER A SERIES OF MONTHS TO DETERMINE HOW MANY EGGS ARE LEAVING THE OVERYIAN RESERVE EACH MONTH AND THEREFORE HOW MANY EGGS SHE IS LIKELY TO STILL HAVE IN THE OVARIAN RESERVE NOW THERE'S A NON INVASIVE WAY TO DO THIS AS WELL ALTHOUGH TYPICALLY AN OB G Y N WILL DO BOTH WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED WITH ULTRASOUND EN MEASURE SOMETHING CALLED A M H WHICH IS ANTI MULARIAN HORMON WHICH IS A HORMONE THAT IS RELEASED BY THAT ANTRALFOLICAL POPULATION THE POPULATION OF FOLICALS AND EGGS THAT LEAVE THE OVARIAN RESEREF EACH MONTH SO ONE IS A BLOOD DRAW MEASURE OF A HORMONE A M H THE OTHER IS A STRUCTURAL IMAGING MEASURE OF THE ANTRAOFOLICALS DIRECTLY AGAIN THE TYPICAL TREND IS FOR THE NUMBER OF ANTROFOLICALS TO DECLINE OVER TIME SO ONE MIGHT EXPECT FOR INSTANCE THAT A WOMAN IN HER TWENTIES OR THIRTIES MIGHT HAVE TWENTY THIRTY MAYBE VEN FORTY ANTRALFOLICALS THAT ARE EXITING THE RESERVE EACH MONTH AND AGAIN THAT'S THE TOTAL ACROSS BOTH OVERIES AGAIN THESE ARE JUST AVERAGES THESE R DISTRIBUTIONS THAT ILL PBE PEOPLE WITH FAR FEWER THER WILL BE PEOPLE WITH FAR MORE BUT THAT OVER TIME REGARDLESS OF WHERE WOMAN STARTS OUT FROM ONE DECADE TO THE NEXT HALF DECADE AN DECADE AND SO ON THAT THE NUMBER OF ANTRAFOLICALS WILL DECLINE END THE AMOUNT OF OR THE LEVELS OF A M H WILL ALSO DECLINE SO WHAT DOIES THIS ALL MEAN WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT IF YOU ARE A WOMAN WHO IS IN HER TWENTIES OR THIRTIES OR FORTIES WHATEVER YOUR AGE IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN CONCEIVING IN THE FUTURE IT'S VERY LIKELY A GOOD IDEA TO GO TO OUR OB G WY N AND GET EITHER YOUR A M H LEVELS MEASURED OR YOUR FOLICAL COUNT MEASURED AND TO DO THAT SEVERAL TIMES IN A GIVEN PERIOD AND I DON'T MEAN A MENSTRA PERID I MEAN GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME ACROSS SEVERAL MONTHS TO DETERMINE WHAT IS THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF FOLCALS WHA'S YOUR AVERAGE A M H LEVEL THEREBY GIVING YOU SOME WINDOW INTO HOW MANY EGGS YOU ARE LIKELY TO STILL HAVE IN YOUR OVARIAN RESERVE I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY WOMAN THAT I'VE SPOKEN TO IN HOW MANY OB G WY NS MORE IMPORTANT LY CASE THEY SPEAK TO MANY MORE WOMEN ABOUT THIS THAN I EVER HAVER EVER WILL WISH THAT THEY HAD DONE THIS EARLIER RIGHT THEY THING O OTHERMEN I'M IN MY TWENTIETH SOME LIKELY TO HAVE A TONOPOLICALS OR THEY GOT PREGNENT ONCE BEFORE AND SO THEY'RE NOT SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE NUMBER OF FOLICALS OR THEIR A M H LEVELS BUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN I WAS TOL LED IN RESEARCHING FOR THE CEPISODE THAT THE EARLIER AND MORE FREQUENT THAT WOMEN DO THIS PRECEDURE OF MEASURING A M ACH AND MEASURING THEIR FOLICAL COUNT THE HIGHER THE PROBABILITY THAT THEY WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE A SUCCESSFUL FERTILIZATION AND PREGNANCY WHEN THEY SEEK TO DO SO NOW THE MERRER IMAGE OF ALL THIS OF COURSE IS THE SPERM AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A KIND OF COMMON MISCONCEPTION OUT THERE THAT YONOW THE SPERM ME ONLY NEED ONE AND INDEED YOU ONLY NEED ONE BUT ACTUALLY YOU NEED MANY AND IT'S ONLY ONE THATS ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY FERTILIZE THE EGG SO THIS WHOLE CONCEPT OF YOU ONLY NEED ONE IS A BOTH DISMISSIVE OF THE SPERM BUT MORE IMPORNTLY DISMISSIVE OF THE BIOLOGY OF THE SPERM END THE EGG WE IT ONLY TAKES ONE SUCCESSFUL SPERM AND ONE SUCCESSFUL EGG BT THAT SORT OF LIKE TELLING A WOMAN HEH YOU ONLY NEED ONE EGG RIGHT YOU NEED ONE EGG OF SUFFICIENT QUALITY IN THE RIGHT TIME AND PLACE AND YOU NEED ONE SPERM OF SUFFICIENT QUALITY IN THE RIGHT TIME AND PLACE IN ORDER TO GET SUCCESSFUL FERTILIZATION AND HOPEFULLY PREGNANCY BUT YOU NEED A LOT OF SPERM IN ORDER TO GET A HIGH PROBABILITY THAT THAT ONE SPERM WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY FERTILIZE THE EGG SO WE HAVE THIS IMAGE OF SPERM IS KIND OF THESE A DUMB OPERATORS THATCH A SORT OF SWIM A MINDLESSLY TOWARDS ANYTHING AMAND IF THE BUMP INTO AN EGG THAN THEY FERTILIZE THE EGONETS REALLY NOT THE WAY IT WORKS AS I TALKD ABOUT EARLIER THE SPERM WITH ITS HEAD ITS MID REGION ITS TAIL CHALK A BLOCK WITH MIGHT A CONDRE IN THE MID REGION IS REALLY AN ACTIVE MOTILE SELL THAT INDEED WILL JUST SWIM FORWARD IF IT'S A HEALTHY FORWARD PROGRESSING SPERM BUT YOU MANY MILS OUT THERE JUST SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF HOW MANY QUALITY SPERM THAT THEY HAPPEN TO HAVE NOW GIVEN THE FACT THAT SPERM ANALYSIS IS RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE AND ALSO THE FACT THAT FREEZING SPERM IS RELATIVELY IN EXPENSIVE THINK IT STANDS TO REASON THAT MOST MEN SHOULD AT LEAST GET SOME WINDOW INTO THE NUMBERING QUALITY OF THEIR SPERM NOW IT'S A FAIR ASSUMPTION TO SAY THAT A SOMEONE IS IN THEIR LEIGHTEENS OR EARLY TWENTIES OR THIRDIES THAT THEY PROBABLY HAVE HIGH QUALITY SPRM BUT AGAIN AS WITH THE EGG AND THE IMPORTANCE OF MEASURING A M ACH AND FOLICAL COUNT ACROSS TIME MEN SHOULD REALLY EVALUATE THE QUALITY AND NUMBER OF THEIR SPERM AND WE TALKED A LOBIT EARLIER ABOUT SOME OF THE PERAMETERS THAT A EUROLOGISTS AND OB G YENS LIKE TO SEE WHEN A VALUATING SPRM AT YOU KNOW THERE'S A MINIMUM NUMBER OR CONCENTRATION OF SPERM THAT THEY LIKE TO SEE IF A COUPLE IS GOING TO USE IV F AND BE TRO FERTILIZATION AND TYPICALLY THAT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILLION PER MILL OF SPERM OR SEAMEN AND TYPICALLY THEY WANT TO SEE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO AND FIVE MILL LEADERS OF SEAMEN A OVER ALL IN A GIVEN EJACULATE AFTER A SEVENTY TWO TO FORTY EIGHT HOUR ABSTINENCE PERIOD BECAUSE OF COURSE THE MORE EJACULATIONS THE SMALLER THE THE VOLUME OF THE EJACULATE A IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BUT AFTER FORTY EIGHT TO SEVENTY TWO HOURS YOU MORE OR LESS MAXIMIZE THE VOLUME OF EJACULATE AND THEN OF COURSE THEY WANT TO SEE FIFTY BUT TYPICALLY SIXTY PER CENT OR MORE OF MOTILE SPERM IN ORDER TO GET IVIEF BUT IT MORE IS BETTER AND OF COURSE THERE IS AN ENORMOUS RANGE AS I MENTION BEFORE SOME MALES WILL HAVE ANYWHERE FROM TEN TO TWENTY MILLION SPERM PERMILL LEADER OF EJACULAT AND SOME MEN WILL HAVE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION EH BUT JUST BECAUS THEY HAVE A HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL OF THOSE SPERMAR OF HIGH QUALITY IN CAN FERTILIZE EG SOMETIMES THE MORE THAN HALF WILL BE TWITCHERS AND SOME WILL BE IMMOTILE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH SO IT'S VERY STRAIGHT FORARD WHAT I BELIEVE MOST PEOPLE SHULD DO IN WHAT THE EUROLOGISTS I SPOKE TO AN ADVANCE OF THIS EPISODE I HAV SAID TO DO WHICH IS TO SIMPLY DO A SPERMANALYSIS REFRAIN FROM EJACULATION FOR FORTY EIGHT TO SEVENTY TWO HOURS GIVE A SPERM SAMPLE HAVE THAT SPERM SAMPLE ANALYZED THE COST OF THE SPERM ANALYSIS IS NOT TYPICALLY THAT MUCH A AND CONSIDERING THAT CONCEPTION AND HEALTHY CONCEPTION AND FERTILIZATION IS AN EXPENSIVE PROCESS IF YOU HAVE TO GO THE IN VUTROFERLIZATION ROUT IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THE COST IS PRETTY WELL JUSTIFIED YOU'LL S HAVE THE OPTION TO FREE SPERM OVER TIME THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE AGE OF THE FATHER AND THEREFOR THE AGE OF THE SPERM CAN DICTATE WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A HIGHER INSTANCE OF PROBLEMATIC PREGNANCY OR DEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES INCLUDING AUTISM THAT IS TRUE A YOU PROBABLY HEARD THAT IF THE FATHER IS FORTY YEARS OR OLDER THE INCIDENCE OF AUTISM IS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY THAT IS TRUE ALTHOUGH THE OVER ALL PROBABILITY OF HAVING AN AUTISTIC OFFSPRING IF SOMEBODY IF THE FATHER THAT IS IS FORTY YEARS OR OLDER IS STILL QUITE A BIT LOWER THEN YOU WOULD IMAGINE IT'S NOT AS IF THE PROBABILITY SUDDENLY SKY ROCKETS ON CASO THAT WE WILL HAVE AN EPISODE ON AUTISM AND GENETIC AND NONGENETIC A THA INFLUENCE IS ON AUTISM AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE AUTISM SPECTRUM BUT THE POINT IS THIS I BELIEVE AND THE EURALOGISTS I SPOKE TO WHO ARE INTERESTED IN FERTILITY AND MALE HEALTH AND SEXUAL HEALTH SUGGESTS THAT MEN GET THER SPERM ANALYZED AT LEAST ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS AND CERTAINLY IF THEIRE GOING TO WANT TO CONCEIVE CHILDREN IN THE DISTANT FUTURE THAT THEY CONSIDER FREEZING THEIR SPERM BECAUSE THAT TOO IS FAIRLY NOMINAL COST IN ORDER TO FREEZE SPERM AT A YOUNGER AGE AND OF COURSE IF YOU CAN FREEZING U SPERM FROM THE TIME IN WHCH YOU WERE YOUNGER WHY WOULDN'T YOU RIGHT I MEAN YOU CAN STILL OP TO  GO FOR NATURAL PREGNANCY LATER IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO BUT HAVING THAT IN RESERVE IS UM GENERALLY A GOOD IDEA AND I DISCUSS SOME OF THE PERAMETERS THAT AR THAT ARE LOOKED FOR AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF AN UNDERLYING ISSUE WHEREBY FOR INSTANCE THERE IS VERY LITTLE SPERM IN AN EJACULATE AS I MENTION EARLIER THE SEMINAL FLUID IN THE EJACULATE COULD HAVE ZERO SPERM IN IT BUT THE VOLUME OF EJACULATE COULD APPEAR COMPLETELY NORMAL SO JUST BECAUSE YOUREJACULATE VOLUME IS A NORMAL TO YOU ORS IN THAT RANGE OF YOU KNOW TWO TO FIVE MILL LEADERS WELL THEN THAT DOESN'T NESURELY MEAN THAT THERE ARE ANY SPERM THERE OR THAT THERE ARE VERY FEW SPERM THERE AND THE FEW SPERM THAT ARE THERE WERE THE MANY SPERM THERE THERE ARE FUNCTIONALLY MOTILE SO GET THIS ANALYZED IT'S REALLY WORTH DOING AND AGAIN IS NOT SOMETHINGYOU HAVE TO DO EVERY YEAR AT SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO DO PROBABLY EVERY FIVE YEARS AT LEAST UNTIL THE POINT WHERE YOU'VE CONCEIVED AS MANY CHILDREN AS YOU EVER WANT TO CONCEIVE SO THE BASIC TAKE AWAY HERE IS THAT IF YOU ARE A WOMAN TO GET YOUR EGG COUNT YOUR ANTRO PHOLICAL COUNT THAT IS AND THEREFORE YOUR RESERVE OF EGGS INDIRECTLY MEASURED AND OF COURSE ALSIGAT YOUR A MACE A LEVELS MEASURED AND IF YOUARE A MALE TO HAVE A SPERM ANALYSIS AND TO DO THAT RELATIVELY EARLY IN FACT ANOTHER INCENTIVE FOR DOING THAT EARLY IS THAT YOU HAVE A COMPARISON POINT SO THAT FOR INSTANCE IF YOU ARE IN YOUR EARLY TWENTIES IN YOUR NOT THINK ABOUT HAVING KIDS AT ALL ARE YOURE THINKING THAT YOU MIGHT SOMEDAY HAVE KIDS BUT IT'S A REALLY SOME DAY SOME DAY FAR OFF IN THE FUTURE WELL IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE A REFERENCE POINT FROM WHICH TO COMPARE YOUR BIOLOGY IN YOUR EARLY TWENTIES TO YOUR BIOLOGY IN YOUR MID OR LATE THIRTIES ARE FORTIES WHEN YOU MIGHT HAPPEN TO BE INTERESTED IN CONCEIVING AND IF THAT DOESN'T PROVIDINSTANTIF ENOUGH I SHOULD MENTION AND THIS IS IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT AND THAT I THINK BOTH MALES AND FEMALES ARE NOT AWARE OF IS THAT ONE IN FIVE COUPLES THAT HAVE ISSUES WITH FERTILITY THE ISSUE ANDS UP FALLING ON THE BIOLOGY THAT IS THE QUALITY OF THE SPERM OR A LACK OF NUMBER OF SPERM SO YOU N I THNK THERE'S A MISCONCEPTION THAT WHEN FERTILITIES IN ISSUE ITS ALWAYS IN ISSUE WITH THE EGGS UM AND THIS AGE DEPENDENT A DECLINE IN THE EG QUALITY AGAIN S THE BEST LANG UHICH WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US AT THE MOMENT THIS AGE DEPENDENT DECLINE IN EGG QUALITY IS OFTEN TO BLAME BUT NOT ALWAYS ONE IN FIVE COUPLES THAT HAVE CHALENGES CONCEIVING TURNS OUT THAT ITS CAN BE IN ISSUE WITH THE SPERM AND OF COURSE THERE ARE NUMBER DIFFERENT SPERM ANALYSIES THAT SHOULD ALL THE OTHER PERAMETERS OF SPERM APPURE NORMAL NOW FOR INSTANCE YOU CAN GET A DIENA FRAGMENTATION ANALYSIS CAN SEE WHETHER OR NOT THE DEANAE OF THE SPERM ARE SOMEHOW DESTRUPTED YOUROLOGISTS THESE DAYS ARE EXCELLENT AT FIGURING OUT FOR INSTANCE IF A MALE HAS LOTS AND LOTS OF SPERM EVERYTHING WOULD SCRAPE BUT THE SHAPE OF THE HEAD OF THE SPERM ISN'T QUITE RIGHT IF IT'S NOT OVAL ENOUGH AND IT'S TO ROUNDED THAT COULD BE A GENETIC DEFECT UNDER WHICH CONDITIONS THERE IS ZERO PROBABILITY OF THE MALE EVER NATURALLY CONCEIVING RIGHT REGARDLESS OF WHO THE FEMALE PARTNER IS BELIEVE OR NOT MALES CAN HAVE A TON OF SPRM BUT IF THEY CARRY A CERTAIN GENETIC DEFECT  THOS SPERM WILL BE INCAPABLE OF DEPOSITING THOSE TWENTY THREE CROMOZOMES INTO THE EGG HOWEVER THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH THAT SPERM CAN BE COAXED OR FORCE TO FERTILIZE THE EG AN DEPOSIT ITS GENETIC CONTENTS BY INVITRO FERTLIZATION AND THEN INPLANTATION INTO THE FEMALE SO AGEIN LOTS OF REASONS TO HAVE A EGG RESERVE ANALYSIS BY ULTROSOUND AND AMATE FOR FEMALES AND LOTS OF REASONS FOR MALES TO HAVE A SPERM ANALYSIS AND OF COURSE TYPICALLY WITH A SPERM ANALYSIS AND A OVERYAN RESERVE ANALYSIS WI'LL BE A HORMONE ANALYSIS AND I'M A VERY STRONG BELIEVER IN PEOPLE GETTING IN INSIGHT THAT IS A WINDOW INTO THEIR HARMONAL COMPOSITION NONCIOUS WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER PROBLEMS BUT STARTING AT A PRETTY EARLY AGE OU IT'S ONLY DONE ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS ARE SO HAVING A REFERENCE POINT TO YOUR TWENTIES AND TO YOUR THIRTIES AND MID THIRTIES FOR WHEN YOU FELT A CERTAIN WAY MAY BE AS IN THE CASE FOR MANY PEOPLE I KNOW THEY ACTUALLY FEEL BETTER IN THEIR FORTIES THAN THEY DID IN THEIR TWENTIES BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING A LOT OF THINGS TO SUPPORT THEIR HEALTH THAT IS POSSIBLE BUT IN MANY CASES PEOPLE START FEELING NOT AS WELL OR THEIR FERTILITY SEEMS TO BE DROPPING OFF OR ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PERAMETERS THAT WE DISCUSS TO DAY OR RELATED TO VITALITY AND LONGEVITIE SEEM TO BE DROPPING OFF OVER TIME AND THEY WANT TO GET A INSIGHT INTO WHAT COULD BE THE ISSUE AND HORMONES ARE SOMETIMES NOT ALWAYS BUT SOMETIMES INVOLVED IN THOSE UNDERLYING ISSUES AND THERE IS NOTHING AS VALUABLE AS HAVING A REFERENCE POINT FROM A TIME IN WHICH THINGS WERE GOING WELL TO A VALUATE THE FOR INSTANCE THE LEVELS OF HORMONES NOT JUST TESTOSTERONE BUT ALSO ESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE AND SO FORTH SO YOU NEED A COMPARISON POINT IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE CHANGED SO ALL OF THIS IS A A STRONG PUSH FOR PEOPLE TO USE YOUR INSURANCE IF YOU ARE ABLE TO PUT IT ON INSURANCE OFTENTIMES AN PEOPLE ARE ND IF NOT TO TRY AND FIND A REASONABLE OR REASONABLY A PRICE WAY TO DO A SPIRM AND EGANALYSIS AND TO IDEALLY DO A HORMONE ANALYSIS AS WELL IT'S REALLY GIN A SET YOU UP FOR THE MAXIMUM PROBABILITY OF BEING ABLE TO CONCEIVE CHILDREN WHEN YOU WANT TO AND ALSO TO AVOID A BUNCH OF OTHER HEALTH RELATED ISSUES THAT ARE INVOLVE HORMONES AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND IN GENERAL TO SUPPORT YOUR MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HALTH SO IVE BEN TALKING ABOUT A BUNCH OF THINGS TO DO THERE ARE COUPLE OF THINGS TO BE MINDFUL OF TO ACTIVELY AVOID IF YOUR GOAL IS TO BE AND REMAIN FERTILE AND THAT'S REGARDLESS OF WHEATHER OR NOT YOU WANT TO CONCEIVE CHILDREN IN THE FUTURE OR NOT NOW IN THE CONTECTS OF THIS DISCUSSION THE SAME THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD TO BE TRUE FOR OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR HEALTH TURN OUT TO ALSO BE TRUE SO LET'S TO START WITH THE BASICS EVERYBODY SHOULD BE GETTING APPROXIMATELY SIX TO EIGHT HOURS OF SLEEP EVERY NIGHT THAT SHOULD BE QUALITY SLEEP OPTIMIZING YOUR SLEEP IS FUNDAMENTAL TO BALANCING YOUR HORMONES NOW BOUNCING YOUR HORMONES AS KIND OF A CATCH PHRAS FOR ALL THINGS RELATED TO PROPER HORMONE REGULATION SLEEP IS THE FUNDAMENTAL LAYER OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL EALTH AND PERFORMANCE OF ALL KINDS END BELIEVE AR NOT FERTILITY WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT SLEEPING WELL OR ENOUGH STRESS HORMONES IN PARTILAR QUARTESALL SHIFT TO PEKING LATER IN THE DAY AND THOSE ELEVATED CORTISAL LEVELS LATER IN THE DAY CAUSE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PROBLEMS IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES MANY OF WHICH IMPACT FERTILITY SO CONTROLLING CORTES ALL STARTS WITH CONTROLLING YOUR SLEEP IT ALSO IMPACTS TO STOSTERONE AND ESTROGEN LEVELS SO OF COURSE THE PROPER RATIOS OF TESTOSTERON AND ESTROGEN WILL VARY FROM MALES TO FEMALES BUT IN ORDER TO GET THOSE RIGHT OR AS RIGHT AS THEY CAN BE WITHOUT OTHER INTERVENTIONS YOU WANT TO MAKE SUREYOU'REGETTING ENOUGH QUALITY SLEEP HOW MUCH SLEEP MOST PEOPLE NEED ABOUT SIX TO EIGHT HOURS OF SLEEP PER NIGHT WAKING UP ONCE MAY BE TWICE PER NIGHT IN MILL THE NIGHTING GOING BACK TO SLEEP IS NOT SUCH A BEDEAL BUT SIXTY EIGHT HOURS OF SOLID SLEEP WOULD BE IDEAL SOME PE EBLE NEED A LITTLE BAT LESS IN ORDER TO FUNCTION YOU NIT FIVE HOURS SOME PEOPLE NEEL LO BIT MORE DEVELOPING TEAN AGERS AND BABIES AND KIDS NEED A LOTMORE PEOPLE ARE SICK ORRECOVERING FROM INJURY NEED A LOTMORE WE'VE DONE MULTIPLE EPISODES ON SLEEP WE HAVE A TOOL KIP FOR SLEEP AVAILABLE FREE AT HUBERMAN LABDOT COME YOU GO THERE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR THE NEWS LETTER ALTHOUGH YOU CAN IF YOU WANT S GO TO TOOL KIP FOR SLEEP UNDER THE MINU AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DOWNLOW THAT OR YOU CAN MANGES VIEWED ON THE SCREEN IF YOU DON ON DOWNLOADIT HAS LOTS OF TOOLS WE'VE DONE IN EPISODE CALLED PERFECT YOUR SLEEP THAT HAS A LOT OF TOOLS THERE ALL TIME STAMPED FOR YOU HAVE DONE A MASTER YOUR SLEEP EPISODES A LOTS OF TOOLS TO GET YOUR SLEEP BUT GET YOUR SLEEP RIGHT IF YOU ARE WISHING TO CONCEIVE AND OR TO SIMPLY HAVE HEALTHY BIOLOGY TO BE FERTILE OR OTHERWISE ANC THIS FUNDAMENTAL NOW THERE ARE OTHER THINGS TO NOT DU AND THOSE AGAIN FALL INTO THE SOMEWHAT OBVIOUS CATEGORIES BUT THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARENAWARE OF JUST HOW STRIKING AN EFFECT THESE CERTAIN BEHAVIOURS THAT YOU WANT TO AVOID CAN HAVE IN DIMINISHING YOUR FERTILITY FOR BOTH MALES AND FEMALES SO AS TALK ABOUT THOSE THE FIRST ONE IS SMOKING AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SMOKING HERE WHICH I NOT SMOKING NICOTINE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SMOKING CANABAS AND INDEED THERE ARE STRONG DATA AND I WILL PUT A REFERENCE TO ONE OF THE BETTER LARGER ANALYSIES OF THESE DATA THEIRE STRONG DATA SHOWING THAT CANABAUS REDUCES FERTILITY NOW I CAN ALREADY HER THE SCREAMS FROM THE BACK ALTHOUGH THEY'RE PROBABLY OF FAIRLY DRAWLED OUT SCREAMS FROM THE BACK OF PEOPLE SAYING THEY SMOKE CANABAS AND THE HAVE NO TROUBLE CONCEIVING CERTAINLY THERE WILL BE EXCEPTIONS BUT WHETHER NOT YOUR MALE OR FEMALE SMOKING CANABAS IS A BAD IDEA IF YOU WANT TO CONCEIVE A HEALTHY CHILD CAN YOU STILL CONCEIVE A EALTHY CHILD WHILE SMOKING CANABAS PROBABLY CERTAIN PEOPLE CAN MANY PEOPLE WILL GREATLY DECREASE THE PROBABILITY OF A HEALTHY FERTILIZATION AN PREGNANCY BY SMOKING CANABAS THERE ARE EXCELLENT DATA TO SUPPORT THAT AS WELL NICOTINE BOTH SMOKED OR VAPED IS GOING TO DISRUPT THE PROCESS OF FERTILIZATION AND CAN DESTRUPT PREGNANCY DRAMATICALLY OCAS SO JUST AVOIDED ALLTOGETHER HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN WILE I TURNS OUT THAT SMOKING INCREASES WHAT AE CALLED REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES THIS GREATLY DESRUPTS THE QUALITY OF THE EGG AT THE LEVEL THE SPINDLE IN MITACONDRA AND A NUMBER OF OTHER FEATURES AND IN THE SPERM TURNS OUT THAT SMOKING DOESN'T NECESSARILY DISRUPT THE SPIRM DIRECTLY ALTHUGH IT CAN CAUSDY AND A FRAGMENTATION WHICH CAN CAUSE ALL SORTS OF ABNORMALODIES CAN PREVENT FERTILIZATION CAN LEAD TO BURTH EFECTS IN THE OFFSPRING BUT MORE INPORTANTLY IT INCREASES WHAT ARE CALLED REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES IN THE SEMINAL FLUID IN THE SEAMEN THAT CONTAIN THE SPIRM THIS VERY UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER HEALTHY CIRCUMSTANCES BEAUTIFULLY ORCHASTRATED CHEMISTRY OF FLUID THAT ALLOWS A PIRM TO THRIVE IN THEIR TRAJECTORY AN ATTEMPT TO FERTILIZE THE EGG AND LEA TO A HEALTHY PREGNANCY SO IF YOU ARE SMOKER AND YOU WANT TO CONCEIVE THE BEST ADVICE I CAN GIVE YOU IS TO QUIT SMOKING AND YES THAT INCLUDES CANABUS AS WELL NOW I AM NOT SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVES THAT CANABUS ACROSS THE BOARD IS NOT USEFUL THERE ARE MEDICAL APPLICATIONS AND OTHER APPLICATIONS I TALK ABOUT THAT IN AN EPISODE ALL ABOUT CANABUSTS FOR HEALTH AN DISEASE AND NOTICE HEALTH WAS IN THEIR TO SO YOU CANABISTS SMOKERS DON'T COME AFTER ME WITH I GUESS WHATEVER IT IS WITH A BONGS AND PIPES OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU WANT OR WITH VAPES THE POINT IS THAT WHILE IT CAN BE BENEFICIAL FOR CERTAIN POPULATIONS IT'S CERTAINLY BAD FOR OTHERS AND IF YOU'RE TRYING TO CONCEIVE IT IS BAD FOR FERTILITY AND FOR A HEALTHY PREGNANCY NOW THAT'S SMOKING A END VAPING BY THE WAY  VAPING IS INCLUDED THERE NOW THE NEXT CATEGORY OF DON'TS RELATES TO ALCOHOL NOW EVERYONE IS HEARD THAT DRINKING DURING PREGNANCY IS A BAD IDEA YOU MAY HAVE HEARD AND SOME PEOPLE OF TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE CULTURES IN WHICH THEY ALOW IF YOU WILL OR EVEN CONDONE SADLY ONE OR TWO DRINKS WHILE PREGNANT PROVIDED IT'S JUST CHAMPAGNE OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT THAT IS A TURRIBLE IDEA I DIDN'T EPISODE ALL ABOUT ALCOHOL BOTH IT'S POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS OF WHICH THEY'RE TURN OUT TO BE ZERO AND YES THAT INCLUDES RED WINE IT IS FAR BETTER TO NOT DRINK AT ALL AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO DRINK THE LIMIT IF YOUARE A HEALTHY ADULT WHO'S NOT TRYN TO CONCEIVE NOT PREGNANT AND YOU DON'T HAVE ISSUES WITH ALCHOLISM IS PROBABLY TWO DRINKS PER WEAK TOTAL THAT'S RIHE TWO DRINKS PER WEAK TOTAL AND THAT'S THE LEVEL THAT YOU REALLY SHOULD CONSIDER IF YOU ARE DRINKER IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO'SE TRYING TO CONCEIVE HOWEVER FOR WOMAN WHO BECOMES PREGNANT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DRINKS THAT YOU SHOULD ALLOW YOURSELF PER WEAK WHILE PREGNANT AND BREASTFEEDING IS INDEED ZERO THERE IS ABSOLUTELY KNOW EVIDENCE THAT ONE CAN QUOT INQO GET AWAY WHICH DRINKING DURING PREGNANCY AND PEOPLE SAY WILL I HAD A PERFECTLY HEALTHY CHILD BUTY OF COURSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HEALTH OF THAT CHILD WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD YOU NOT DRANK AT ALL NOW I'M NOT HERE WITH ANY GENERALLY STRONG STANCE AGAINST ALCHOL I MYSELF M I SOMEBODY WO HAS A DRINK EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE ALTHOUGH I'M  DON'T CONSIDER MYSELF SOMEBODY WHO HAS A STRONG PROCLIVITY FOR ALCOHOL AND OF COURSE I'M AT THIS MOMENT I'M NOT TRYING TO CONCEIVE CHILDREN AND I'M  CERTAINLY NOT PREGNANT SO THAT'S SAFE FOR ME A BUT FRANKLY HAVEN'T AD O DRINK IN ALL VERY LONG TIME AND SO I DON'T MISS IT AND THAT'S ME BUT I DO REALIZE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ENJOY ALCOHOL AND SO IT'S THAT TWO DRINKS PER WEAK LIMIT THAT REALLY SETS THE UPPER LIMIT AND THRESHOLD BEYOND WHICH YOU START RUNNING INTO ISSUES WITH CELLAR MUTATION YOU START RUNNING INTO ISSUES OF OXIDAIVE TRESS GREATLY INCREASE CANCER RISK AND PARTICULAR BREAST CANCE A RISK ALL THAT'S COVERED IN THE ALCOHOL EPISODE THT WE DID YOU CONFINE AT HUBERMAN LABDOT CALM AND TIME STAMPED IF YOU WANT A NAVIGATE TO SPECIFIC TOPICS AND SO FORTH I KNOW ALL ABOUT THE DATA SUPPORTING THE STATEMENTS THAT I'M MAKING SO ON AND SO FORTH NOW IFYOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO SEEKING TO CONCEIVE OR YOU FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY THAT SOME COUPLES DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AS WE'RE NOT TRYING BUT WE'RE NOT NOT TRYING MEANING THEY'RE NOT USING BIRTH CONTROL THE HAVE LETTING CHANCE RUN IT'S COURSE WELL THEN YOU SHOULD DEFLY BE AWARE OF THE DATE A SHOWING THAT EVEN JUST ONE BOUT ONE BOUT OF SO CALLED BIN DRINKING WHICH IS FIVE TO SIX DRINKS IN A GIVEN NIGHT OR HALF DAY IN A TWELVE HOUR PERIOD ONE BOUT OF FIVE TO SIX DRNKS IF YOU'RE WOMAN ORIOR MAN GREATLY INCREASES BOTH THE LIKELIHOOD OF MUTATIONS IN THE EMBRYO THAT WOULD RESULT FROM A FERTILIZATION AND AT THE SAME TIME FOR REASONS THAT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS TO YOU BASED ON ALL THE BIOLOGY WO'VE TALKED ABOUT IT GREATLY REDUCE PROBABILITY OF FERTILIZATION NOW THAT ABSOLUTE DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD USE THE INGESTION OF FIVE OR SIX DRINKS AS A METHOD OF BIRTH CONTROL THAT IS NOT WHAT I AM SAYING HERE WHAT I AM SAYING IS IS THAT IF YOU GO OUT ON A GIVEN NIGHT AND YOU HAVE FIVE OR SIX DRINKS AND YOU HAPPEN TO BECOME PREGNANT THE PROBABILITY THAT THAT PREGNANCY WILL BE DISRUPTED IN SOME WAY IS GREATLY INCREASED WHAT THE EXACT CONSEQUENCES ARE NO ONE CAN TELL YOU BUT ALSO IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO IS INTERESTED IN CONCEIVING A CHILD WILL THEN YOU ABSOLUTELY SHOULD ABSTAIN FROM INGESTING DRINKS MORE THAN ONE OR TWO DURING THE TIME IN WHICH YOUR TRYING TO CONCEIVE AN IDEALLY IT WOULD BE ZERO AND YOU CERTAINLY WOULD WANT TO AVOID DRINKING MULTIBLE DRINKS PERNIGHT AND SO THIS IDEA OF GOING OUT AND HAVING IN OW THREE OR FOUR DRINKS OR FOUR OR FIVE DRINKS IN A GIVEN NIGHT AT A TIME IN WHICH YOU'RE ALSO TRYING TO CONCEIVE CHILDREN THE BIOLOGY TELLS US THE APDEMEOLOGY TELLS US THAT THIS IS JUST A TERRIBLE IDEA IT'S GOING TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF FERTILITY IN SUCCESSFUL PREGNANCY AND IF THERE IS A SUCCESSFUL PREGNANCY THE WORD SUCCESS NEEDS TO BE IN QUOTES RIGHT ON ANYTHINK EVERY PARENT EVERY SPECIES FOR THAT MATTER WANTS TO INCREASE THE PROBABILITY OF HAVING HEALTHY OFFSPRING AND SO A TO MY MIND ANYWAY AND TO THE OBIGUIENDS IND THE EUROLOGISTS THAT ARE FOCAST ON FERTILITY THAT I SPOKE TO EVERYONE WILL SAY TRY AS HARD AS YOU CAN TO AVOID THE SO CALLED BIN DRINKING EPISODES AND AGAIN THESE EPISODES ARE ONE NIGHT OF CONSUMING FIVE TO SIX DRINKS NOW ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IN THIS CONTEXT IS THAT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CONSUMING FIVE OR SIX DRINKS IN A GIVEN NIGHT EXTEND OVER MANY WEEKS FOLLOWING THE INGESTION OF THAT ALCOHOL IF YOU'RE A MALE WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT'S GOING TO IMPACT THE QUALITY OF YOUR SPERM AND GREATLY DECREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESSFUL FERTILIZATION AND OR HEALTHY PREGNANCY OVER THE PERIOD OF THAT ENTIRE SPERMATAGENESIS WINDOW WHICH IS AS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE SIXTY TO NINETY DAYS RIGHT SICTY TO GENERATE THE SPERM AND THEN IN SOME ADDITIONAL TIME FOR THE SPURM TO BE TRANSPORT TO THE POINT WHERE THEY COULD BE EJACULATED IF YOU'ARE WOMAN AND YOU HAVE FIVE OR SIX DRINKS ON A GIVEN NIGHT WILL THEN YOU ARE GOING TO DESTRUPT THE QUALITY NOT OF JUST THE EGG THAT EVENTUALLY OVULATES BUT INDEED THE ENTIRE POOL OF FOLICALS THAT LEAVES THE OVARIAN VOULT AND RESERVE AND FROM WHICH THE ONE EGG WILL BE SELECTED IN OTHER WORDS YOU ARE REDUCING THE QUALITY OF ALL OF THE EGGS THAT YOU HAPPEN TO DEPLOY THAT MONTH NOW SOME OF YOU WHO WERE REALLY FOLLOWING THE BIOLOGY EARLIER MIGHT SAY WHAT IF I HAVE THOSE FIVE OR SIX DRINKS DURING THE TIME IN WHICH I'M A MENSTRATING JUST IN WHICH THERE'S BLEEDING PRESENT AND THEREFORE I HAVEN'T YET OVULATED AH BUT IF YOU REMEMBER THE BIOLOGY WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER SPECIFICALLY THERE IS A SUBSET OF FOLICALS AND EGGS THAT LEAVE THAT OVARYAN RESERVE QUITE A BIT BEFORE THAT ONE EGG IS SELECTED FOR AND OVULATES AND OF COURSE THERE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT HORMONAL CASCADES IND THE GENERAL MILL EU OF THE OVERY WHICH ARE IMPORTANT AND ARE BEING REGULATED BY DIFFERENT HORMONES AND YES INDEED THE REGULATION OF THOSE HORMONES IS STRONGLY IMPACTED BY ALCOHOL THROUGH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PATHWAYS THROUGH THE REGULATION OF THE NER TRANSMITTER GABA UP IN THE BRAIN ITS ACTUALLY LOT OF GABAN GABA RECEPTORS IN THE HYPOPHALMUS THE VERY REGION FROM WHICH GAN ADITROPE AN RELEASING HORMON ORE OLD FRIEND FROM COUPLE HOURS AGO IN THIS DISCUSSION YOU TO DESTRUCT GEANOR H SECRETION YOU CAN DESTRUCT PETUITARY FUNCTION WITH ALCOHOL AGAIN AND AGAIN WHAT WERE SEEING IS THAT CONSUMING MORE THAN ONE OR TWO DRINKS PER WEEK OF ALCOHOL IS REALLY DETRIMENTAL TO THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF FERTILITY AND THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND THAT'S TRUE FROM BOTH THE MAL SIDE IN THE SPERM AND IS TRUE FROM THE FEMALE SIDE AND THE EGG SO MY SIMPLE ADVICE ON THIS AS IF YOU ARE WISHING TO HAVE A HEALTHY FERTILIZATION AND PREGNANCY THE BEST THING TO DO WOULD BE AVOID ALCHOL TOGETHER AND IF YOU ARE GOING TO DRINK TO REALLY LIMIT THAT DRINKING TO ONE OR TWO DRINKS PER WEEK MAXIMUM SO THOSE OF TE MAJOR DON'TS REALLY AVOID EXCESSIVE STRESS AND I SHOULD MENTION EXCESSIVE TRESS IS NOT JUST BEST AVOIDED BY GETTING ENOUGH QUALITY SLEEP AT NIGHT ALTHOUGH THAT IS THE PRIMARY WAY THERE AE OTHER WAYS TO AVOID STRESS WE'VE DONE ENTIRE EPISODES ABOUT THIS AND WE HAVE A TOOL KIT RELATD TO REDUCING STRESS WITH VERY SIMPLE ZERO COST TOOLS AGAIN YOU CAN FINALL THAT HUBERMAN LAVDOK COM I SHOULD MENTION THIF YOU WANT TO FIND ANY EPISODE

TO THOSE TOPICS A LIKEWISE WITH SLEEP LIKEWISE WITH ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TOPICS YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN SO GET ENOUGH QUOLITY SLEEP AND THEREBY REDUCE STRESS AND ALSO DIRECTLY BUFFER STRESS WITH REAL TIME TOOLS TO BUFFER STRESS THATAVE TALKED ABOUT OM IN THE EPISODES THAT YOU CAN ACCESS AND THERE WAYS TO GREATLY REDUCE YOUR OVERALL LEVEL OF STRESS TO LIMIT ANY COURTIS ALL THAT'S RELEASED TO EARLY IN THE DAY WHICH IS WHEN YOU WANT CORTIS ALL RELEASED AND NOT HAVE IT LATE IN THE DAY AND SO ON AND SO FORTH SO REDUCE YOUR STRESS AND AS I JUST TOLD YOU BY ALL MEANS DO NOT DRINK MORE THAN TO DRINKE PER WEEK AND ZERO IS BETTER THAN TO IF ANY ONE TELLS YOUO THERE'S YOU KNOW ALL THIS A RESVER TRALL IN RED WINE IN THAT'S GOOD FOR USS THE DATA SIMPLY TELL US THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGHFORS VERY TRALN RED WINE TO REALLY HAVE ANY POSIVE HEALTH BENEFIT THE DATA ROUND RESTS VER TRALL AND HEALTH BENEFITS ITSELF IS UNDER QUESTION NOWADAYS ZERO ALKHOL IS BETTER THAN ANY ALCOHOL TWO DRINKS PER WEEK IS THE LIMIT ALSO LIMIT OR ELIMINATE OR AVOID NICOTINE AND IDEALLY CANIBATE SMOKING AND VAPING AT THE TIME IN WHICH YOU ARE TRYING TO GET PREGNANT AND CERTAINLY IF YOU ARE PREGNANT AVOID ALL OF THE THINGS AS EST YOU CAN THAT I JUST DESCRIBED A MOMENT AGO NOW THERE A COUPLE OTHER DON'T SET ARE REALLY IMPORTANT UM ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DON'TS RELATES TO S T IS OR SECTUALLY TRANSMITTE INFECTIONS EVERYONE WHO SECUALLY ACTIVE SHOULD GET AN ST I CHECK IN FACT YOU GO TO A FERTILITY CLINIC OR YOU GO FOR SPERMANALYSIS OR YOU GO FOR AGANALYSIS ALMOST ALWAYS THEY WILL DO IN S T I CHEK EVEN IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN A MONOGMOUS RELATIONSHIP EVEN IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE NOT SECUALLY ACTIVE IN YOUR SOMEBODY WHO SEEKING TO USE I V F WITH A SPERMEDONER OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT WHY WISER SO MUCH CONCERN ABOUT THAT IS IT ABOUT AVOIDING UM GIVING BIRTH TO A CHILD THAT A HAS AM  SOMETHING LIKE A HERPE'S INFECTION OR SOMETHING OR CH IV WILL CERTAINLY THAT'S ONE REASON BUT THAT'S A DOWN THE LINE REASON BECAUSE AT THE TIME WHEN SOME ONE GOES INTO THE CLENIC FOR ONE OF THESE SPERMARAGANALYSIES THAT'S WELL IN ADVANCE OF ANY PREGNANCY RIGHT THE REASON IS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF S T S IN PARTICULAR CLEMIDIA FOR WHICH IT GREATLY INCREASES THE PROBABILITY OF MISCARRIAGE SO CLEMITIA'S ONE OF THOSE UVERY INSIDIOUS AND CRIPTIC S T IS BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE BOTH MAILS AND FUMALS DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY HAVE CLEMIDIA AND THEN THEY CAN CARRY CLEMITI AT THE TIME IN WHICH THEY CONCEIVE IN THE THAT CAN LEAD TO CTOPIC PREGNANCIES AND OR MISCARRIAGES SO BY ALL MEANS GET AN ST I CHECK IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO SEEKING TO CONCEIVE CHILDREN OR A VALUATING YOUR FERTILITY GENERALLY CLEMITIA CAN ALSO HAVE DAMAGING EFFECTS ON THE EPIDITIMUS AND ON THE VERYS OTHER ASPECTS OF MAL RE PRODUCTIVE HEALTH IN THE FUTURE WE WILL DO AN EPISODE ALL ABOUT SECUAL HEALTH THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR THAT BUT GET AN S T I CHEK IF YOUR GOAL IS TO CONCEIVE A HEALTHY CHILD NOW THE OTHER THING THAT CAN HAVE A VERY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON FERTILITY AND HEALTHY PREGNANCY IS A VIRAL INFECTION AFOR INSTANCE IF A MALE HAS HAD A SEVERE VIRAL ILLNESS AND THIS CAN BE ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT VIRAILLNESSES FROM FLUE TO COALD OR ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT VIRASIS PIC YOUR FAVORITE VIRUS IN THE PREVIOUS SEVENTY TO NINETY DAYS THAT CAN GREATLY DIMINISH THE NUMBER AND OR CQUALITY OF SPERN ISO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THIS IS ALSO IMPORTANT I FOR GON TO GOING IN DO A SPERMANALYSIS AND YOU HAD A VIRAL INFECTION IN THE PREVIOUS SEVENTY TO NINETY DAYS WITHEN YOU EN TO BE AWARE OF THAT BECAUSE IT COULD GREATLY IMPACT THE PRAMETERS OF THAT SPERMANALYSIS LIKEWISE FOR WOMEN IF YOU'VE HAD A SERIOUS VIRAL INFECTION IN THE PREVIOUS THIRTY DAYS DOES THAT MEAN YOU SHOULD NOT TRYING CONCEIVE NOT NECESSARILY BUT YOU SHOULD TALK TO YOUR OB G W N ABOUT THAT THERE ARE DATA SHOWING THAT VIRAL INFECTION IN PRERTICULAR OF INFLUENZA IN THE MOTHER IN THE FIRST TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY HAS SOME CORRELATION IT'S NOT A HUNDRED PER CENT BUT SOME CORRELATION WITH NEGATIVE MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES OF THE OFFSPRING SOMETIME LATER INCLUDING SKIS AFRENIA THIS IS SOME OF THE WORK THAT WAS DONE A CALTECK A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO UM AND OTHER LABORATORIES AS WELL THOSE DATA ARE STILL BEING BUILT UP OVER TIME AGAIN IT'S NOT ONE FOR ONE IT'S NOT CAUSAL SO IF YOU DID GET AN INFLUENZAR COLD OR OTHER KIND OF VIRAL INFECTION DURING THE FIRST TRIMESTER OR ANY TRIMESTER PREGNANCY AM I DON'T WANT TO CAUSE ALARM BUT YOU SHOULD TALK YOUR OBE G Y AN ABOUT THIS THE GOAL OF COURSE IS TO AVOID VIRALILLNESS AT ANY T IME WHE YOU ARE TRYING TO CONCEIVE OR HAVE A  HEALTHY PREGNANCY BUT OF COURSE I'M SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET ILL AND THE CHILDREN CAN TURN OUT TO BE PERFECTLY NORMAL AND FINE BUT IT IS SOMETHINGTHAT YOU WANT TO AVOID ANY WILL IMPACT YOUR AGANALYSIS AND IT WILL IMPACT SPERMANALSIS NOWD ONE THING I FOUND REALLY SURPRISING AND RESEARCHING THIS EPISODE WAS THAT ONE IN TWENTY FIVE MEN CARRY A COPY OF I MUTATION FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS NOW SOME OF YOU ARE PROBBLY FAMILIAR WITH SYSTIC FIBROSIS AS A CONDITION THAT CAN CAUSE A ISSUES WITH THE LUNGS THE ACCUMULATION OF FLUID IN THE LUNGS OR OTHER TISSUES SYSTIC FIBROSIS IN ORDER TO EXPRESS THAT WAY OF ACCUMULATION OF FLUD IN THE LUNGS YOU REALLY NEED TWO COPIES ARE YOU NEED TWO MUTINT COPIES OR YOU NEED TWO COPIES OF THE CYSTIC FIBROSIS GENE ONE AND TWNTY FIVE MEN WILL CARRY JUST ONE COPY AND THEREFORE WILL NOT HAVE ANY SYMPTOMS OF SYSTIC FIROSIS BUT THOSE ONE AND TWENTY FIVE MEN WILL HAVE DEFECTS IN THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE VAST DEFERENCE THE DOCT THROUGH WHICH THE EJACULATE NEEDS TO PASS IN ORDER TO EVENTULLY BE EJACULATED OUT OF THE EURETHRA AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THESE MEN CAN HAVE WHAT APPEARS TO BE NORMAL SEMEN VOLUME BUT THAT THEY WON'T HAVE NORMAL NUMBERS OF SPERM AND THAT'S NOT BECAUSE OF A DEFISITING MAKING THE SPERM THE TESTIES CONFUNCTION JUST FIND THE BRAIN AND THE PETUITARY COMMUNICATING WITH THE TESTIS JUST FIND BUT THAT LITERALLY THE PASSAGE WAY BY WHICH THE SPERM ARRIVE WITHIN THE SEMINAL FLUID AND EVENTUALLY EJACULATE IS DESERRUPTED BY THE SYSTIC FIBROSIS GENE LUCKILY IF SOMEBODY HAS JUST ONE COPY THE SYSTIC FIBROSIS GENE AND THEIR MALE AND THIS IS THE ISSUE THE VAST DEFERENCE EITHER CAN BE REPAIRED BY A EUROLOGIST TOS EXPERT IN THE SURGICAL REPAIR OF VASEFERENCE OR SPERM CAN BE EXTRACTED FROM THE TESTICAL DIRECTLY WHICH A MIGHT SOUND LIKE A PAINFUL PRECEDURE BUT I A BELIEVE NOWADAYS A IN TALKING WITH VARIOUS EXPERTS ON THIS TURNS OUT THAT IT CAN BE DONE WITH A MINIMUM OF DISCOMFORT AND CERTAINLY IF THE GOAL IS TO HAVE A HEALTHY CHILD YOU NA NEED THOSE SPERM SIGNA WANT TO GET THEM A ONE WAY OR THE OTHER REGARDLESS OF THE DISCOMFORT NOW BEFORE GETTING INTO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO IN THE POSITIVE SENSE TO INCREASE YOUR FERTILITY WE DO NEED TO TOUCH ON JUST A FEW OTHER THINGS THE WANT TO AVOID IN ORDER TO AVOID DIMINISHING YOUR FERTILITY AND THIS MAINLY RELATES TO MALES BUT IT WILL ALSO BE RELEVANT TO FEMALES AND OF COURSE WHEN I SAY ALSO RELEVANT OF FEMALES I'M REFERRING TO THE FACT THAT IF IT'S A WOMAN AND A MAN WO ARE TRYING TO CONCEIVE O THEN SHE OF COURSE IS GOING TO BE INTERESTED IN HERED QUALITY BUT ALSO THE SPERM QUALITY AND OF COURSE THERE ARE WOMEN WHO ARE CONCEIVING BY WAY OF SPERM DONER THROUGH IVIAFERIUIE OR OTHERWISE BUT IN ANY CASE THE NEED TO UNDERSTAND AND MAXIMIZE THE QUALITY BOTH THE EGG AND THE SPERM IS PARAMOUNT SO IN ORDER FOR MEN TO MAXIMIZE THE QUALITY OF THEIR SPERM AS I MENTION EARLIER DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A BIG DIFFERENCE WHETHER OR NOT THEY USE BOXERS OR BRIEFS OR WETHER OR NOT THEY ONE TO Q GO COMANDO THEY DON'T WHERE ANY BOXERS OR BRIEFS OF ANY KIND HOWEVER IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE TESTAICLES COOL ENOUGH THEY NEED TO BE ABOUT TWO DEGREES COOLER THEN THE REST OF THE BODY AND THEIR NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THAT AS I MENTION BEFORE AVOID GOING IN HOT TUBS DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH YOU'RE TRYING TO CONCEIVE CHILDREN YOU SHOULD ALSO AVOID GOING INSANAS DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH YOU ARE TRYING TO CONCEIVE CHILDREN AND IF YOU DO GO IN THE SANA YOU CAN BRING AN ICE PACK THERE AN YOU CAN PUT IT ON THE TESTAICLES IN ORDER TO OFFSET THE HEAT OF THE SANA AND KEEP THE TESTICLES COOL WHILE IN THE SANA THE OTHER THING THT YOU'LL DEFLY WANT TO DO IS AVOID PUTTING A LAP TOP OR ANY OTHER HOT DIVICE DIRECTLY ON TO YOUR LAP THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT UM DEVICEIS THAT YOU CAN PUT ON YOUR LAP YOU OU CAN BUT BOOKS ARE A BOX ARE THEIRE THESE DEVICES TERE DESIN TO A DISPEL THE HEAT FROM THE LAP TOP I WOULD SAY IF YOU'RE TRYING TO CONCEIVE JUST KEEP THE LAPTOP OFF OF YOUR LAP JUST PUT IT ON A TABLE OR STANDING DEST OR WHATEVER JUS KEEP IT OFF OF YOUR LAP ALSO THERE ARE SOME REALLY INTERESTING DATA SHOWING THAT THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT MEN SPEND SITTING REGARDLESS OF WHTHER NOT THEY SIT WITH THEIR ANKLE ON THEIR OPPOSITE KNEE OR WUTH KNEES SPREAD IN THE CLASSIC MANSPREAD STANCE OR A OR ANY OTHER KIND OF SEATED STANCE IS GOING TO INCREASE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SCROTUM FOR REASONS THAT ARE SOMEWHAT OBVIOUS IF YOU THING BYUT THE ARCHITECTURE OF ALL THIS THAN BOTH MEN AND WOMEN IF YOU PUT ENOUGH THOUGHT TO IT OH YE THAT WOULD INCREASE THE TEMPERATURE OBVIOUSLY AVOID U SEAT HEATERS IN CARS ARE OTHERWISE BUT REDUCING THE TOTAL MOUNT OF TIME THAT YOU SPEND SEATED IS REALLY IMPORTANT IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THE TEMPERATURE MILLIEU OF THE SCRODUM OPTIMAL FOR SPERM QUALITY AND FERTILIZATION AND AS I MENTION EARLIER IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR LEGS ARE NOT REALLY BIG TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ARE CREATING A HOTTER THAN IS HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT FOR THE SCRODUM IN TESTACLES SO A HOTTER THAN NORMAL ENVIRONMEN F THE TESTACLES CAN BE CAUSED BY LEGS THAT ARE VERY LARGE OPERTHIES THAT ARE VERY LARGE DUE TO OBISITY OR DO TO THOSE OPROTHIZES BEING TOO MUSCULAR SO BY ALL MEANS DON'T SKIP LEGDAY BUT BE AWARE THAT IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHOSE TRYING TO CONCEIVE YOU WANT TO DO WHATEVER YOU CAN TO REDUCE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SCROTUM OR AT LEAST NOT LET IT GET TOO HOT FOR TOO LONG AN SO A I CAN THING OF ALL SORTS OF OF A REASONS NOW THAT MEN OR GAN O COME UP WITH TO U DO THE MANSPREAD STANCE OF THEIR KNEES REALLY FAR APART EVEN FURTHER IF THEY HAVE LARGE LEGS THAT'S NOT A DISCUSSION WE WANT TO HAVE HERE AND THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS ABOUT REALLY THE PRINCIPLE IS WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT WHICH IS TO KEEP THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SCRODUM IN TESTACLES LOWER THAN THE REST OF YOUR BODY THERE'S A DIRECT BLOOD FLOW FROM THE BODY TO THE TESTAICLE THAT PROVIDES BLOOD FLOIDS DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT THAT BLOOD PATHWAY SHOULD BE OUTSIDE THE BODY AND AS FAR AWAY FROM THE BODY IS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO GET THE TEMPERATURE MILLEU OF THE SCROTUM IN TESTACLE CORRECT FOR HEALTHY SPERM QUALITY NOW A TOPIC THAT IS SURE TO BE A BIT CONTROVERSAL BUT IT REALLY SHOULDN'T BE BECAUSE THE DATA AT LEAST TO ME ARE VERY CLEAR IS THIS ISSUE OF PONE USE AND SPERM UALITY NOW THIS CAN OPEN UP A WHOLE A RAY OF ISSUES RELATED TO THINGS LIKE E M FS AND YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE OUT THERE HAVE YOU KNOW IDEAS ABOUT FIVE G AND ALL F THE STUFF THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS DISCUSSION IS ABOUT THE DISCUSSION I ABOUT TO HAVE WITH YOU RELATES TO THE FACT THAT THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS AN THE HEAT RELATED EFFECTS OF SMART PHONES KAN INDEED HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON SPERM QUALITY AND YES INDEED ON TESTOSTRONE LEVELS AS WELL I'M GOING TO REFER YOU TO A PAPER AND WE WILL LINK IT IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS THE TITLEOF HIS PAPER IS EFFECTS OF MOBILE PHONE USAGE ON SPERM QUALITY NO TIME DEPENDENT RELATIONSHIP ON USAGE A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND UP DATED METAANALSIS IS THE PAPER THAT CAME OUT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT PHONES AMID A RADIO FREQUENCY ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES WHICH ARE CALLED CALLED R F RADIO FREQUNCY E M 'S ELECTROMAGNIC WAVES ATD A LOW LEVEL BETWEEN EIGHTY AND TO TWENTY TWO HUNDRED MEGAHERTS THAT CAN BE ABSORBED BY THE HUMAN BODY WE KNOW THIS SOKE THIS IS NOT CONTROVERSIAL AND HAVE POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON BRAIN HEART ENTICRANT SYSTEM IN RE PRODUCTIVE FUNCTION THAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED KEEP IN MIND THERE IS BASICLY NO CONTROVERSY THAT RADIO FREQUENCY WAVES AND E M FS CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON BIOLOGICAL TISSUES THE QUESTION IS HOW INTENS ARE THOSE RADIO FREQUENCY WAVES AND  M FS AND HOW DETRIMENTAL ARE THOSE ON THOSE BIOLOGICAL TISSUES OK IT'S A MATTER OF DEGREES BUT THERE IS VERY LOTWLE CONTROVERSY AS TO WHETHER NOT THEY HAVE AN EFFECT ON BIOLOGICAL TISSUES AND I AM AWARE OF ABSOLUTELY ZERO DATA SHOWING THAT THEY CAN HAVE A POSIVE EFFECT ON BIOLOGICAL TISSUES SINCE WHAT WERE MAINLY TALKING ABOUT NOW ARE SMARTPHONES WE WANT O SEPARATE OUT THE HEAT EFFECTS OF SMARTPHONES FROM THE  M FS RELATE TO THE FECT THAT THEY ARE WIFI SMART PHONES OR THEIR USING CELLAR TOWERS AND WHYFI ONE OR THE OTHER A COMMINATION CASE SO THEIR NUMBER DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE PHONE THAT CAN BE DETRIMENTAL WE NEEN TO SEPARATE THOSE OUT WHY WELL BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD THAT CARRYING YOUR PHONE IN YOUR POCKET CAN REDUCE YOUR TESTOSTRONE LEVELS AND SPERM COUNT AND GUESS WHAT THAT IS TRUE THE DATA CONTAIN WITHIN THIS METANALSIES AND OTHER MEN AND ALSIES CLEARLY POINT OUT THAT IT CAN REDUCE SPERM COUNT AND MAYBE TESTOSTRONE LEVELS SIGNIFICANTLY BUT CERTAINLY SPERM COUNT AND MOTILITY SIGNIFICANTLY IT REDUCES SPERM QUALITY SO SHOULD YOU AVOID PUTTING YOUR PHONE IN YOUR POCKET YOUR CERTAINLY YOUR FRONT POCKET I WOULD SUGGEST YES RIHT IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO IS SEEKING TO CONCEIVE RIGHT I'M NOT SOMEBODY WHO IS GOING TO STOP USING MY SMART PHONE I DON'T EXPECT ANY ONES AGAINSTOP USING THE SMARTPHONE THE QUESTION IS SHOULD YOU CARRY IN YOUR FRONT POCKET IF YOU ARE MAIL I THINK TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE THE ANSWER IS PROBABLY AVOID DOING THAT TOO MUCH OF THE TIME IDEALLY DON'T TO IT AT ALL THEN PEOPLE SAY WHAT WOULD EFY TURN OFF THE WHY FY OR I TURN OFF THE CELLAR ACCESS THEN IS IT STILL A PROBLEM WELL IT'S A PROBLEM DUE TO THE HEAT RELATED EFFECTS AND THEN PEOPLE SAY WELL I DON'T ACTALLY FEEL THE HEAT OF THE PHONE A DOESN'T GET THAT WARM BUT THE TEMPERATURE EFFECTS OF THE PHONE IT TURNS OUT ARE ENOUGH EVEN UNDER CONDITIONS IN WHICH PEOPLE DON'T REPORT IT TO BE UNCOMFORTABLY WARM THAT IT CAN CHANGE THE TEMPERATURE MILLIU OF THE TESTACLE IN WAYS THAT CAN DIMINISH SPIRM QUALITY HOW MUCH AND HOW THAT RELATES TO FRTILITY AND EALTHY PREGNANCY NOT CLEAR BUT SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS TO AVOID IF YOUR GOAL IS TO HAVE A HEALTHY FERTILIZATION AND PREGNANCY WELL THEN BY ALL MEANS JUST DON'T CARRY ED IN YOUR FRONT POCKET THAN PEOPLE SHAY WILL WHAT ABOUT BACK POKETOR WHAT ABOUT BACKPACK IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT AVOIDING BEING TOO CLOSE TO THE PHONE IS PROBABLY BETTER FOR YOUR SPIRM QUALITY THEN PUTTING THE PHONE VERY CLOSE TO YOUR TESTACLES OR ANYWHERE ELSE ON YOUR BOTY BUT IT'S ALSO THE REALITY THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CARRY A PHONE NOW DAYS RIGHT IT'S JUST THE REALITY I THINK ALLIKING THE CURRENT ONE ESTIMATES ANS DISCUSSED IN THIS PAPER THAT NINETY PER CENT OF THE HUMAN POPULATION HAS A SMART PHONE NINETY PER CENT WHICH IS INCREDLE THE ADULT POPULATION OF COURSE I ALTHOUGH LOT A KIDS HAVE THEM AS WELL SO THIS PAPER GOES ON TO DETAIL A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STUDIES AND OUT COMES FROM STUDIES BUT BASILY WHAT THEY FIND AND HERE ON PARAPHRASING IS THAT AH THE DATA INDICATE THAT SPIRM QUALITY DECLINES WHEN PEOPLE START USING A MOBILEPHONE SO FROM THE POINT THEY START USING MOBILPHONE REGARDLESS OF THE USAGE TIME THIS IS IMPORTANT USE TO BE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS FOUR HOURS A DAY OR MORE OF HOLDING YOUR PHONE OR HAVING THAT PHONE CLOSE TO YOUR BODY WAS GOING TO DIMINISH SPIRM QUALITY IT TURNS OUT THAT IT'S NOT RELATED TO USAGE CHIME THAT'S EVEN THE TITLE OF THE PAPER IT'S JUST THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE USING MOBILEPHONES IS REDUCING SPIRM COUNT AND QUALITY THAT'S THE REALITY IS IT ENTIRELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE REDUCTIONS AND SPIRM QUALITY AND MAY BE EVEN THE REDUCTIONS IN TESTOSTRONE LEVELS THAT WE ARE OBSERVING FROM DECADE TO GET DECATE GOING FORWARD I DOUBT THAT'S THE CASE IS IT LIKELY TO BE ONE OF THE MAJOR PLAYERS I'VE GOT MY BHAT ON THE FACT THAT IT IS BASED ON THE DATA THAT I'VE OBSERVED AND SO IF ANY OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO PERUSE THE DATA IN THIS MOUNT METANALSIS ARE QUITE GOOD THI STUDY LOOKED AT EIGHTEEN STUDIES IN INCLUDE FORTY TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SAMPLES THEY WE'RE ABLE TO SEPARATE OUT THE RADIO FREQUENCY VERSES THE HEAT EFFECTS AND THEY WERE ABLE TO ELIMINATE THIS TIME OF USAGE UNVARIABLE THAT PREVIOUSLY WE THOUGHT IF YOU WERE EXPOSED TO A LOT OF A SELPHONE CONTACT THAT IT WAS FAR WORSE THAN IF YOURE EXPOSED TO A LITTLE BIT TURNS OUT OF YOUR SUPOSE TO ANY AT ALL YOU'RE GOING TO DIMINISH SIRM QUALITY WHAT DOS THAT MEAN DOES I MEAN THAT NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO IF YOU ONA A SMART PHONE THEY ARE GOING TO DIMINISH SPIRM QUALITY I THINK THAT SHORT ANSWER IS YES BUT THAT YOU CAN MITIGATE IT WHAT MIGHT YOU DO WELL KEEPING YOUR PHONE AWAY FROM YOUR GROWING ARE AS FAR FROM YOUR GROWING AS POSIBLE IF YOUR MAL WHOSE WISHING TO CONCEIVEN MAY BE EVEN A MALE WHOSE WISHING TO MAXIMIZE IS TESTOSTRONE LEVELS BECAUSE IT DOES APPEAR THAT RADIO FREQUENCY WAVES AND THE HEAT FROM THE PHONE SO BOTH OF THOSE FACTORS INDEPENDENTLY END TOGETHER OF COURSE CAN DESTRUPT THE LIDIC CELLS OF THE TESTEES AN THE PRODUCTION F TESTOSTRONE AND INTERTESTICULAR TESTOSTRONE IS IMPORTANT FOR SPIRM PRODUCTION THE EXACT BIOLOGICAL VARIABLES LEADINGS ALL THESE CHANGES IS IN EXACTLY CLEAR BUT IF YOU'RE LIKE ME YOU SAYKA PROBLY NOT A PROBLEM FOR MOST MAILS TO CARRY THEIR PHONE BUT PROBABLY BEST I NOT CARRY I IN THE FRONT POCKET MAYBE EVEN AVOID CARRYING THE BACK POKET AS WELL AGAIN IN E FUTURE WE WILL HAVE AN EPISODE ALL ABOUT BLUE TOOTH WI'LL TALK ABOUT HEM A VARIOUS ASPECTS OF EAMAPS ITS A SUPER INTERESTING A DATA SET AND IT'S A DATA SET WHICH THERE'S A TON OF CONTROVERSY A IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING HOWEVER AND THEIR MORE AND MORE CUALITY DATA COMING OUT ALL THE TIME AND I THINK GOING FORWARD WE ARE GOING TO SEE THAT INDEED THERE ARE SOME NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SMART PREPHONES RELATED TO BOTH THEIR RADIO FREQUENCY A TRANSMISSION AND THE FACT THAT THEY GENERATE HEAT AND IN GENERAL HEAT IS NOT GOOD FOR BIOLOGICAL TISSUES SO ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT HEAT AND SPERM AND HOW HEAT IS DETRIMENTAL TO SPERM HAS TO RAIS THIS ISSUE OF WEATHER NOT COLD IS GOOD FOR THE TESTACLE HOKET WELL NOW THERE'S A LOT OF DATE A STARTING TO COME OUT ABOUT THE POSITIVE EFFECTS THE POSITIVE BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE ON DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF BRAIN BIOLOGY SUCH AS THE RELEASE OF DOPOMING IN NOROPANEFERAN AND ON THE BILOGY THE BODY TO SOME EXTENT METABOLISM BUT MORE SO THE IMPACT ON BROWN FAT STORES WHICH ARE GOOD FOR US SO CAL BROWN FAT OR MO GENESIS ITA LOT RELATED TO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND WE'VE DONE ENTIRE EPISODES ON DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AGAIN YOU CAN FIND THAT A HUBERMAN LABDOT TOM WE DID A GUEST EPISODE WITH AN EXPERT ON THE USE OF COLD FOR HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE WITH MY COLLIC CRAK HELLER FROM STAMFORD DEPARTMENTOBIOLOGY WE ALLS HAVE A TOOL KIT ON HOW TO APPLY DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE FOR HEALTH FOR BOTH FEMALES AND FORMALES FOR SPORTS PERFORMANCE COGNAN PERFORMANCE MOOD SLEEP ET CETERA YOU CAN FIND ALL THAT AGAIN HUBRMN LABDAT CALL TOLYZERO COST GO INTO THE MAN YOU GO TO NEWS LATTER AND SCROLL DOWN AND YOU'LL FIND THOSE WHEN THINKING ABOUT SPERM QUALITY WE WANT TO REMEMBER THAT EXCESSIVE HEAT IS BAD NOW DOES THAT MEAN THAT DELIBERATE COLD IS GOOD WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR CAUSES OF LOWERED SPERM COUNT AND OVERALL REDUCE SPERM QUALITY THAT'S QUITE COMMON IS THE PRESENCE OF WHAT'S CALLD T A VEROCELL OF VERICELL IS GON THE VERICOSE VEINS OF THE VEINS THAT ENERVATE THE TESTACLE AND WHAT IT ESSENTIALLY DOES IS IT MEANS THAT BLOOD WILL POOL IN THE TESTICULAR REGION IT CAN'T CIRCULATE BACK TO THE BODY QUICKLY ENOUGH AND THEREFORE THE TEMPERATURE OF THAT ENVIRONMENT INCREASES THERE'S SOME OTHER THINGS TAT VERICELS DO WHICH CAN BE OBSTRUCTIVE AT THE PHYSICAL LEVELS THE NOT JUST TEMPERATURE RELATED IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT USING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE CAN BE HEALTHY FOR THE SPERM BECAUSE OF THE WAYS NOT THAT COLD DIRECTLY SUPPORTS TESTOSTERONE OR SPERM CUALITY BUT RATHER BECAUSE COLD REDUCES HEAT CA SO YOU WILL FIND A AVAILABLE ON LINE A THT I THINK THEY ARE ACTUALLY CALLED A FORGIVE ME BUT THAT'S WHAT ARE CALLED AD IN NAME THEM ALED SNOWBALLS THESE ARE OF A THERE SORT OF LIKE JELL PACK A COLD BRIEFS THAT A YOU CAN BUY AND AND MEN WILL WEAR FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME I I DON'T THINK YOU WEAR THEM ALL DAY YOU WEAR THEM FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOW USING COLD SHOWERS AND ICE BATHS AND CIRCULATING COLD BATHS ARE GOING INTO A COLD OCEAN OR LAKE FOR ANY NUMBER OF THE DIFFERENT REASONS THI TALK ABOUT EARLY RE I MYSELF START EVERY DAY WITH EITHER A ONE TO THREE MINUTE COLD HOWER OR ONE TOR THREE MINUTE A IMMERSION UP TO MY NECK IN A COLD BATH YOU KNOW COLD A WATER CIRCULATING WATER OR A COLD SHOWER I DO THAT MEANLY FOR THE PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTS RELATED TO THE LONGLASTING INCREASES IN DOPENING AN EPINEPHERAN BUT THERE ARE OTHER DATA STARTING TO COME OUT SHOWING THAT THAT SORT OF APPROACH OR SIMILAR APPROACH IS CAN INCREASE TESTOSTERONE LEVELS AND MAY BE VEN SPIRM COUNTS CAN REDUCE CORTIS ALL LATE IN THE EVENING IF THE COLD EXPOSURE IS DONE EARLY IN THE DAY SONE AND SO FORTH SO LOT OF INTERESTING DATA COMING OUT IN REALLY GOOD JOURNALS THETE ARE PURE REVIEWED AND SO ON IN HUMANS I SHOULD MENTION THE STUDIES ARE DONE IN HUMANS TO SUPPORT THE USE OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE BUT AGAIN IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE TO IMPROVE SPERM QUALITY CAN IT WORK YES INDEED IT CAN WORK EITHER INDIRECTLY BY INCREASING TO STOSTERONE OR DIRECTLY BY IMPROVING SPIRM QUALITY BUT BOTH OF THOSE EFFECTS ARE LIKELY TO BE INDIRECT BY VIRTUE OF REDUCING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE TESTICAL OVER ALL NOT BECAUSE THERE'S ANY SORT OF MAGIC EFFECT OF COLD ON THE TESTICAL NOW I HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT A NUMBER OF YOU IN PARTICULAR FEMALES LISTENING TO THIS  GOING TO SAY IS DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND FOR THAT MATTER IS DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE LIKE SONOR HOT TUB GOOD OR BAD FOR THE OVERY FOR EGGS AND FOR FERTILITY NOW THERE THERE FEWER DATA TO LOOK TO UNFORTUNATELY BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE DONE IN THE WAY THAT I JUST DESCRIBED ONE TO THREE MINUTES TO DAY IDEALLY EARLY IN THE DAY THROUGH COLD SHOWER OR IMMERSION UP TO THE NECK DOESN'T HAVE TO BE NICE BATH COULD BE COLD CIRCULATING A WATER OR EVEN NONCIRCULATING COLD WATER AND PEOPLE SAY WELL HOW COLD I SHOULD O MENTION THAT BEFOR HOW COLD THERE IS NO WAY I CAN TELL YOU EXACTLY HOW COLD THE WATER SHOULD BE BECAUSE FOR SOME PEOPLE SIXTY DEGREESE FARENHEIHTE WILL BE EXCEEDINGLY COLD FOR OTHER PEOPLE FORTY DEGREES IS GOING TO BE MORE APPROPRIATE HOW COLD SHOULD YOU MAKE IT IF YOU'RE GOING TO EMBRACE THESE PRACTICES YOU WANT TO ACCORDING TO THE LITERATURE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS MAKE IT UNCOMFORTABLY COLD SUCH THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO GET OUT BUT SAFE RIGHT YOU DO'T WANT TO GOING TO THIRTY DEGREE WATER A IMMEDIATELY YOU CAN ACTALY HAVE A HART ATTACK AND DIE IF YOU DO THAT SO YOU WANT A PROGRESS GRADUALLY INTO THE COLD SO YOU DN'T WANT A SHOCK YOUR SYSTEM TOO MUCH ALTHOUGH IT IS THE ADRENNAL AND EVOKED BY THAT THAT QUICKENING OR SHORTENING OR ELIMINATION OF THE BREATH FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WHEN YOU GET INTO A UNCOMFORTABLY COLD WATER THAT CORRELATES WITH OR IS ACTUALLY THE REFLECTION OF WOULD BE MORE ACCURATE TO SAY THE RELEASE OF A DRENNALIN AND THEN DOPOMINE AND SO FORTH WHICH HAS BEEN VERY WELL DOCUMENTED SO UNCOMFORTABLY COLD BUT SAFE TO STAY IN AND I CANNOT TELL YOU AN EXACT NUMBER THAT IS UN COMFORTABLY COLD BUT SAY FOR YOU IT'S GOING TO DIFFER A PERSON BY PERSON YOU WANT TO FIGURE THAT OUT JUST LIKE I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH WEIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD SQUAT IN ORDTER TO ACHIEVE SOME EFFECT OF A RESISTANCE TRAINING FOR THE LEGS THAT IT'S GOING TO DIFFER DEPENDING ON A YOUR STRENGTH IN YOUR PRIER EXPERIENCE AND SO FORTH SO EASE INTO IT BE SAFE BUT IT DOES APPEAR THAT BOTH FOR MEN FOR REASONS I TALKED ABOUT A FEU MINUTES AGO AND FOR WOMEN THAT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE CAN BE BENEFICIOL FOR FERTILITY AND FOR HORMONE PRODUCTION BUT IN PARTICULAR FOR FEMALES IN TERMS OF REGULATING CORTIS ALL AND FOR HORMONE PRODUCTION NOW YOU MIGHT SAY OCATE GETTING INTO COLD IS STRESSFUL HOW CAN THAT BE HELPFUL FOR REGULATING STRESS WILL TURNS OUT WHEN YOU GET INTO THE COLD YOU GET A BIG SURGEON ADRENALAND AND THEN DOPOMY WHICH IS VERY LONG LASTING PROVIDED THAT'S DONE IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY SO I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW NOT TOO CLOSE TO SLEEP THEN WHAT YOU DO AS YOU RESTRICT YOUR MAXIMUM CORTIS ALL RELEASE TO A PERIOD EARLIER IN THE DAY THAT BUFFERS REDUSES THAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU WOULD HAVE EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF CORTIS ALL LATER IN THE DAY WHICH NOT ONLY CAN DISTRUP SLEEP BUT IS CORRELATED WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER A HORMONAL EFFECTS THAT ARE NOT GOOD FOR US AND THEREFOR NOT GOOD FOR FERTILITY SO HEAR WHAT I'M DESCRIBING ARE POSITIVE YET INDIRECT EFFECTS OF THE COLD ON HORMONE LEVELS BOTH IN MALES AND IN FEMALES SO FOR MEN WE TALKED ABOUT INCREASE TUSTOCERONE IMPROVE SPIRM QUALITY THAT WAS INDIRECT RIGHT YOUR REDUCING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE TASTACLE BUT IT'S NOT THAT COLD ITSELF IS POSITIVELY IMPACTING THOSE THINGS DOES NOT MAKE SENSE HEAT IS BAD THEREFOR REDUCING TEMPERATURE IS GOOD LIKEWISE WITH FEMALES DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE CAN BE GOOD FOR THE OVERALL FERTILITY PROCESS NOT BECAUSE COLD IS GOOD FOR THE OVERY OR BEIN COLD IS GOOD FOR THE OVERY OR FOR LUTINIZING HORMONE OR FOR FOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE OR ANYTHING ELSE LIKE THAT BUT RATHER THAT USING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AS A WAY TO RESTRICT STRESS IN A DELIBERATE WAY TO A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY INCREASES THE RELEASE OF CORTIS ALL THEN AND INDIRECTLY REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF CORTIS ALL THAT'S RELEASED AT OTHER TIMES ALONG THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS CYCLE ECASE TO THESE ARE POSITIVE YET INDIREXT EFFECTS SO IF YOUR WOMAN WHO REALLY A IS INTERESTED IN AN EXPLORING TELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE OR INJOYS IT OR IS ALREADY DOING IT IN YOUR WISHING TO CONCEIVE GREAT EXPLORE IT DO IT SAFELY OF COURSE BUT EXPLOREI IN CONTINUED TO DO IT HOWEVER IF YOUR SOMEBODY WHO JUST HATES THE COLD INS THA ON TO GO ANYWHERE NEAR IT THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED IT PROVIDED THT YOUR STRESS YOUR SLEEP AND OTHER FACTORS ARE ALL BEING CARRIED OUT PROPERLY THE NEXT THINGS THAT WILL TALK ABOUT AND TRMS A POSITIVE THINGS OR THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IN ORDER TO MAXIMIS FERTILITY FOR BOTH FEMALES AND MALES ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU ALSO GENERALLY HEREABOUT ELSEWHERE RIGHT ALONG WITH SLEEP AND AVOIDING ALCOHOL AND AVOIDING NICOTIN AND AVOIDING CANIBAS AWOODING EXCESSIVE HEAT FOR THE TESTACLE AVOIDING SIX OF STRESS IS THAT YOU WANT TO TRY TO GET ENOUGH EXERCISE I WHY I WOULD EXERCISE HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH OF THIS WELL EXERCISE AND THAT IS BOTH A COMMINATION OF RESISTANCE TRAINING AND CARDIVASCULAR EXERCISE IS GOING TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF THE METACONDRE IN PARTICULARE CARTY OF ASCULAR EXERCISE NIW REALIZE THAT FOR YOU FITNESS EXPERTS OUT THERE ANY TIMES SO ONE SAYS CARDIO PEOPLE CAN'T ROLL THEIR EYES LIKE WHAT IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S ENDURANCE TRAINING THERE IS INTERVAL TRAINING THERE IS HIT TRAINING THERE'S SPRINCS THERE'S ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS SOME OF THOSE OVERLAP SOME OF THEM ARE SEPARATE INDEED THAT'S THE CASE BUT WE CAN USE A GENERAL RULE OF THUMB HERE WHICH IS THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE GETTING ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY AND IDEALLY FORTY FIVE TO SIXTY MINUTES OF EXERCISE PER DAY FOR SIX DAYS PER WEEK MAYBEVEN SEVEN BUT MOST PEOPLE LIKE TO TAKE A DAY OFFOR NEED TO TAKE A COMPLETE DAY OFF EACH WEEK SIX TO SEVEN DAYS PER WEEK IS GOING TO BE GOOD FOR MIGHT OF CONDREAL HALTH AND FUNCTION IT'S ALSO GOING TO INPACT ALL THE OTHER THINGS LIKE QUALITY SLEEP MOOD REDUCING STRESS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH SO EXERCISE WE CAN HANDLE PRETTY QUICKLY AM BY JUST SAYING EVERYONE SHOULD BE DOING IT A NOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE PREGNANT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO OF COURSE CHANGE THE AMOUT OF EXERCISE OR THE TYPE OF EXERCISE TOT THEIR DOING THEIR VARYING OPINIONS ON THAT BUT CERTAINLY THE TYPE OF EXERCISE  AND THE AMOUNT CAN VERY WHEN PEOPLE ARE PREGNANT BUT IF YOU'RE SEEKING TO CONCEIVE GETTING ENOUGH EXERCISES GOOD BECAUSE GOOD FOR THE MITA CONDRE THE MITACONDREA ARE PRESENT IN THAT MIDREGION OF THE SPERM AND MIHTOR CONDREAR CRITICAL FOR CROMIZOMEL SEGREGATION AND THE SPINDLE AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE FORMATION OF A HEALTHY EGG OPULATION AND FERTILIZATION IN THE FEMALE ONE THING THAT I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLEARE INTERESTED IN NOWADAYS IS SO CALLED INTERMITT AN FASTING OR TIME RESTRICTED FEEDING AN LET'S BE FAIR EVERYBODY IS RESTRICTING THEIRFEEDING TIME BECAUSE HOPEFULLY EVERYBODY IS SLEEPING AT SOME POINT IN THE TWENTY FOR OUR CYCLE AND NOBODY'S EATING WHILE THEY ARE SLEEPING THAT SAID MANY PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYING A SO CALLED EIGHT HOUR FEEDING WINDOW OR A TEN HOUR FEEDING WINDOW OR TWELVE HOUR FEDING WINDOW AND INDEED THERE ARE SOME DATA TO SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT THAT CAN BE A GOOD THING FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BIOLOGICAL AN HEALTH PERAMBITERS HOWEVER ALSO A LOT OF DATA SPERSHLLY RECENTLY POINTED THE FACT THAT YOUR OVERALL NUMBER OF CALORIES AND THE QUALITY OF YOUR FOOD SOURCES IS GOING TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLE AND SOME PEOPLE SIMPLY FIND THAT TIME RESTRICTED FEEDING INTERMITEN FASTING AS IT ALSO CALLED IS JUST A CONVENIENT WAY TO INSURE THAT YOUR TOTAL IN TAKE OF CALORIES IS NOT EXCESSIVE FOR WHAT YOU NEED NOW WITH ALL THAT SAID THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT I'VE COVERED IN A SOLO EPISODE AND WILL SOON HAVE AN EXPERT GUESSTD ON SHOWING THAT TIME RESTRICTED FEEDING CAN HAVE CERTAIN POSIIVE OUTCOMES FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ORGAN SELLER AND TISSUE HEALTH A THIS IS SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSIAL BUT THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT BY RESTRICTING YOUR FEEDING WINDOW TO SAY EIGHT HOURS OR TEN HOURS OR TWELVE HOURS THAT IT IS BETTER THAN IF YOU WERE TO EAT OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF OF EACH TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE BUTAGAIN THE DATE ARE STILL IN COMING THE REASON WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT TIME RESTRICTED FEEDING INTERMENTET FASTING IS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DO USE IT BECAUSE THEY FIND IT EASIER TO NOT EAT AT CERTAIN PERIODS OF THEIR TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE THAN TO RESTRICT CALORIES BUT AGAIN KEEP IN MIND YOU AFTE RESTRICT CALORIES OF YOUR GOAL IS TO MAINTAIN OR LOSE WEIGHT  A DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE COVERED IN THAT EPISODE ON INTERMEN FASTING AND IN THE EPISODE WITD DOCTOR LY NORTON AND THAT WE WILL COVER IN OTHER EPISODES IN THE FUTURE SO PREFER TO THOSE EPISODES THAT HUBERMEN LAVED AT CALM IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT INTERMEN FASTING PER SAY FOR SAKE OF THIS CONVERSATION A NUMBER F PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY ASKING IF I RESTRICT MY FEEDING TO A CERTAIN WINDOW EACH TWENTY FOUR HOURS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S CONVENIENT OR BECAUSE I AM EXCITED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL POSIEFFECTS OF INTERMITEN FASTING IS THAT GOING TO DISTR RUP THE LIKELIHOOD OF FERTILITY AND THEREBY A HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND THE SHORT ANSWER TO THAT IS IF YOU ARE A FEMALE AND YOU ARE HAVING REGULAR MENSTRUAL CYCLES THAT IS OF FAIRLY CONSISTENT DURATION SO MAYBE'S TWENTY ONE DAYS MAYBE'S THIRTY FIVE OR ANYWHERE IN BETWEEN BUT IT'S FAIRLY CONSISTENT FROM MONTH TO MONTH AND YOU ARE FOLLOWING INTERMITAND FASTING TIME RESTRICTED FEEDING WELL THEN CHANCES ARE PRETTY GOOD THE IT'S NOT DISRUPTING YOUR FERTILITY AND LIKELIHOOD OF FERTILIZATION AND A HEALTHY PREGNANCY OF COURSE DURING PREGNANCY YOU NEED TO TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE EATING IN A WAY THAT' SUPPORTIVE BOTH OF YOU AND OF THE DEVELOPING FEEDIST THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I AM NOT AWARE OF DATA EXPLORING IN A REGIMENTED WAY TIME RESTRICTED FEEDING JURING PREGNANCY HOCYSO PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IF YOUR PREGNANT DO NOT JUMP ON A TIME RESTRICTED FEEDING SO CALLED INTERMEN FASTING DY TALK TO YOUR OBEGUYEN TALK TO YOUR YOURE DOCTOR TALTOMULTIBLE DOCTORS FOR THAT MATTER O BEFORE DOING ANYTHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE OF COURSE YERE NOW EATING FORTWO OR IF YOU HAVE TWINS IN THEIR YOUR EATING FOR THREE AN VERY IMPORTANT IF HOWEVER YOU'RE NOT YET PREGNANT AND YOU WANT TO BE FERTILE GET PREGNANT OR SIMPLY MAINTAIN A FERTILE POTENTIAL AND BIOLOGY YOURE FALLING INTERMEN FASTING IT'S GOING TO BE THE REGULARITY OF THOSE PERIODS AND REGULARITY OF CYCAL LENGTHTHAT WILL TELL YOU WHETHER NOT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA OR NOT KEEPING IN MIND OF COURSE THAT IF YOU'R TOTAL NUMBER OF CALORIES IS TOO LOW YOUR PERIODS WILL CEASE THAT'S WELL KNOWN EFFECT BUT OF COURSE STRESS CAN ALSO INDUCE CESSATION OF MENSTRATION AND THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS THAT CAN INDUCE CESSATION OF MENSTRUATION AS WELL SOME OF THEM START WITH CHANGES IN THE BRAIN LITERALLY ON THE HYPOTHALEMAS SOME MOCCUR IN THE PETUITARY MANY OF LIESTAL FACTORS CAN DO THAT BUT MOST TYPICALLY IT'S GOING TO BE EXCESSIVE COLORIC RESTRICTION OR IT'S GOING TO BE A COLORI DEFICSIT BROUGHT ON BY EXCESS PHYSICAL ACTIVITYE SO EVEN AS SOME ONE'S EATING A LOT IF THER'RE NOT EATING ENOUGH TO OFFSET THEIR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OR THEIRE NOT EATING ENOUGH OF IN PARTICULAR FATS YOU KNOW THE ESSENTIAL FATIACIDS AND PROTINE BUT ALSO CARBROHYDRATES WELL THEN MENSTRATION CONCEASE AN OF COURSE IF MENSTRUATION IS SEASING CHANCES ARE ALMOST WITH CERTAINTY THAT YOU'RE NOT GETTING REGULAR OPULATIONS NOW IN TERMS OF MALES AND WHETHER NOT INTERMITEND FASTING IS GOING TO DISTRUPTS FROM AMOUTO GENESIS AND TESTOSTERONE PRODUCTION A THERE THERE'S ESSENTIALLY NO DATA WE CAN LOOK TO BUT WE CAN LOOK TO THE GENERAL LOGIC AROUND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BODY FAT TOSTOSTRONE AND SPERMATIGENESIS IN THIS WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS COVERED IN A DISCUSSION I HAD ON OPTIMIZATION OF HORMON HEALTH FOR MALES THAT I HAD WITH DOCTOR COL GELETTE WHOSE A MEDICAL DOCTOR AN OBISITY SPECIALIST CAN YOU FIND THAT EPISODE O HUBREMEN LADOCCALM IF YOU ANE LEARN ALL ABOUT HORMON OPPOSATION IN MALES AN ESSENTIALLY THE STORY ES AS FOLLOWS IF A MALE IS EXCESSIVELY OVER WEIGHT HE'S CARRYING TOO MUCH BODY FAT IN PARTICULAR NOT TOO MUCH MUSCLE ALTHOUGH THAT CAM MUNISSUE TO BUT TOO MUCH BODY FAT IS TYPICALLY THE ISSUE SO YOU KNOW MORE THEN SAY TWENTY PER CENT BODY FAT WELL THEN LOSING BODY FAT IS GOING TO BE THE PRIMARY GOAL FOR MAXIMIZING TESTOSTRONE SPERM HEALTH AND SPERMATIGENESIS IF HOWEVER A MAILS ALREADY LEAN WELL THEN ACTUALLY INCREASING CALORIES WILL INCREASE TESTOSTRONE SO IT'S A BIT OF A OF A COMPLICATED STORY ALTHOUGH NOT SO COMPLICATED THAT NONE OF US CAN UNDERSTAND IT BASICALLY IF YOU'RE OVER WEIGHT YOU SHOULD FOCUS ON LOSING WEIGHT IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE PIRM QUALITY AND HEALTH IF YOU ARE VERY LEAN WELL THEN RESTRICTING YOUR CALORIES TO THE POINT WHERE YOU ARE STRRING TO LOSE WEIGHT OR YOU'RE DROPING EVEN MORE BODY FAT IS UNLIKELY TO INCREASE YOUR TESTOSTRONE FURTHER I DOESN'T IT SURLY MNEAN ITS BAD OR THAT YOU SHOULDN'T TRY AND GO FOR INSTANCE FROM FIFTEEN PER CENT TO TEM PER CENT BODY FOUND NOTING THAT THAT'S BAD IN THAT WILL REDUCE YOUR TESTOSTRONE BUT IN GENERAL IF YOURE ALREADY VERY LEAN SO YOU TEN PER CENT BODY FAT FIVE PER CENT BODY FAT AND YOU START RESTRICTING CALORIES FURTHER YOUR TESTOSTRONE LEVELS WILL DROP SO IN THE CONTECTS OF INTERMEN FASTING IT'S REALLY NOT AN ISSUE OF WHETHER NOT YOUR FEEDING WINDOW IS EIGHT HOURS OR TWELVE HOURS IT'S REALLY INISSUE OF WETHER NOT YOUR GETTING ENOUGH CALORIES TO OFSET THE PHYSICAL DEMANDS AND ACTIVITIES OF YOUR LIFE ETHE'R NOT YOU'RE OWN A MAINTENANCE DIET TO MAINTAIN YOUR WEIGHT AND OF COURSE YOU HVE TO PUT ALL THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF WHETHER NOT YOUR OVER WEIGHT OR LEAN TO BEGIN WITH THE SIMPLE THING TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS AS IF YOUR MAL WHOSE USING BECAUSE YOU LIKE IT INTERMIENN FASTING SOCAL TIME ORSCERTO FEEDING AND YOUR FOLLOWING IN EIGHT HOUR OR MAYBEVEN ONE MEAL PER DAY TYPE OF PROCH ALTHOUGH I DON'T REALLY RECOMMEND THAT FOR NUMBER REASONS WE CO TOK ABOUT SEPARATELY IF YOU'RE EATING OVER THE COURSE OF EIGHT OR TEN OR TWELVE HOLLS HOURS PER DAY BECAUSE A WHAT WORKS FOR YOU AND YOU ARE INGESTING ENOUGH CALRIES TO MAINTAIN YOUR WEIGHT IF YOU'RE ALREADY LEAN OR YOU ARE INGJESTING FEWER CALORIES THEN YOU ARE BURNING IN ORDER TO LOSE WEIGHT BECAUSE YOU ARE ALREADY OVER WEIGHT AND YOU WANT TO LOSE BODY FAT YOU'RE PROBABLY OPTIMIZING FOR ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO IMPROVE SPIRM QUALITY AND TESTOSTRONE LEVELS NOW ALSO IN THAT EPISODE THAT I DID WITH DOCTOR CALGALET ON OPTIMIZING HORMONES FOR MAILS WE TALKED ABOUT TESTOSTRONE REPLACEMENT THEREBE IT'S NOT A TOPIC I WANT TO GET INTO IN ANY DETAIL RIGHT NOW BUT I WILL SAY THIS EMEMBER EARLIER WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SPERMATA GENESIS AND THE FACT THAT IN ORDER FOR SPIRM TO BE GENERATED CONSISTENTLY EVERY MONTH ON GOING FROM THE TIME OF PUBERITY UNTIL ESSENTIALLY THE TIME THAT A MAN DIES YOU NEED TWO THINGS YOU NEED TESTOSTRONE PRODUCTION FROM THE LIDIG CELLS OF THE TESTIES AND YOU NEED SPERMATAGENESIS TO BE SUPPORTED BY THAT ANDURGEN BINING PROTING COMING FROM THE SUPPORT CELLS FROM THE SIRTOLY CELLS SO YOU TESTOSTRON ANY NEED ANDRAGE AN BINDING PROTINE AND YOU NEED THE LIHTEG CELLS AND THE SIRTOLLY CELLS ACTIVE WHEN MEN TAKE ETOGENOUS MEANING FROM OUTSIDE THE BODY TESTOSTRONE EITHER BY CREAM OR BY PATCH OR BY PELLETS OR MORE TYPICALLY BY INJECTION THE MOST TYPICAL TEART PROACH NOWDAYS IS TESTOSTRONE CIPINATE WHICH IS PIOLOGICALLY IDENTICAL TO THE KIND OF TESTOSRONE YOU WOULD MAKE WELL BE AS OF NEGATIVE FEBACC LOUPS WHICH YOU ALSO LEARNED ABOUT EARLIER THE TESTACLES THEMSELVES SHUT DOWN THEIR OWN TESTOSTRON PRODUCTION WHY WOULD THAT BE O CS SO YOU'RE TAKING TESTOSTRONE IN BY STRANGER BY PATCH OR ON ANY OTHER METHOD SO THESE CIRCULATING TESTOSTERONE IN THE AMOUNT THAT DERIVES AT THE TESTACAL IS GOING TO BE HOVLY CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE NOT SUPERPHYSIOLOGICAL BUT ITLL BE SOMEWHERE IN THE HEALTHY REFERENCE RANGE MAY BE ALOBI HIGHER OM NOWDASOM PEOPLE ARE GOING LITTLE BUT HIGHER WOR NOT TELLING ABOUT FULL BLOWN QUOTINQANABOLIC STEEROID USE KEEPING MINOFCOURSE TET ESTEROGEN IS ASTEROID TESTOSTERONS DA STORY BUT WON THING ABOUT STORYES WREMEAN LIKE PERFORMANCE AN HANCING DRUG SO SUPERPHYSIOLOGICAL DOSES WERE TALKING ABOUT WITHIN PHYSIOLOGICAL OR OR NEAR PHYSIOLOGICAL RANGES SO SOMEONES IN TAKING THEIR TESTOSTRONE IN FROM AN OUTSIDE EXOGENOUS SOURCE THE LEVELS OF CIRCULAING TESTOSTERONE WILL BE SUFFICIENTLY HIGH THAT THE PETUITARY WILL REGISTER THAT AND WILL STOP MAKING LUTINIZING HORMON AND GENERALLY PHOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE AS WELL AND AS A CONSEQUENCE SPERMATAGENESIS IS VASTLY REDUCE OR ELIMINATED IN OTHER WORDS FOR MEN WHO ARE ON TIERTIVE OR WHO ARE TAKING TESTOSTERONE FROM AN EXTERNAL SOURCE THEOU NUMBER OF SPERM THAT THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE ITS GOING TO BE DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THERE ARE THINGS THAT THEY CAN DO TO OSET THAT LIKE TAKING H C G HUBAN CORYONIC GANATROPEN JUS US KIND OF A MIMIC FOR LUTINIZING HORMONTES STIMULATE THE TESTIES CONTINUE TO MAKE TESTOSTERONE AND SOME MEN WILL ALSO OR INSTEAD TAKE EPISAH TO STIMULATE THE SERTOLICELLS SO SUPORT SOME ATTER SMAT A SPERMATO GENESIS ESCUSE ME OR BOTH OR SOME COMMINATION SOMEBEO WLEL TAKE CLOMOPHINE CLOMADE THERE ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS OF A BY PASS OR OFSET THE SPERM REDUCING EFFACTS OF TAKING EXOGENIS TESTASTRONE THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT WAS COVERED IN A FAIR AMOUNT OF DETAIL N THAT EPISODE WITH DOCTOR GELETTE BUT JUST KEEP IN MIND THAT IF YOU ARE TAKING TESTOSTERONE FROM AN EXOGENOUS SOURCE YOUR SPERM COUNTS WILL DRAMATICALLY BE REDUCE UNLESS YOU DUE SOMETHING TO OFFSET IT SO IF YOU ARE WISHING TO CONCEIVE YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER NOT YOURE GOING TO OFFSET THE TESTOSTRON REPLACEMENT THERAPY OR WHETHER NOT YOURE GINGTO COME OFF IT ENTIRELY SO YOU'LL NEED TO TALK TO A EUROLOGIST AND A CHRONOLOGIST ABOUT THAT OM AND AGAIN A NUMBER OF TESE DIFFERENT THEMES AND WAYS TO GO ABOUT TAKEERING OFF TIART RECOVERED IN THAT EPISOD WITD DOCTOR CALGELETTE SO IF YOURE ON TERTERE YOU CONSIDERING TAKING IN IN YOUR INTEREST IN HAVING CHILDREN NOT JUST NOW BUT AT ANY POINT YOU REALLY WANT TO TAKE THESE THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION NOW I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT FOR THE NUMBER OF YOU OUT THERE WHO ARE TAKING SUPPLEMENTS SOME OF WHICH WEE TOLKED ABOUT ON THIS PODCAS INAVE TALKED ABOUT AN OTHER PODCAST SUCH AS TONGA ALI TURNS OUT THAT THEIR LOT OF MEN AND WOMEN TAKING TONGA ALI TO REDUCE SEXHORMON BINING GLOBULANE LEVELS TO INCREASE TESTOSTERON AND ESTROGEN IN SOME CASES LABIDO AND SO FORTH THOSE APPROACHES MEANING SUPPLEMNT BASED APPROACHES TO INCREASE TESTOSTRONE OR FREE TESTOSTERONE OR SOME RELATED HORMONES ARE NOT GOING TO SHUT DOWN YOUR OWN INDOGENOUS TESTOSTERON PRODUCTION AND REDUCE THE NUMBER SPIRM THAT YOU MAK OR ALEAST AS FAR AS WE KNOW DISTRUPT OPULATION IN ANY KIND OF WE PROVIDED THAT THE DOSAGES ARE WITHIN NORMAL RANGES AGAIN SUPPLEMENTATION TO SUPPORT YOUR HORMONES SHOULD NOT DISRUPT OVULATION OR S PERMATIGENESIS OR TESTOSTERON PRODUCTION QUITE THE OPPOSITE IT SHOULD ENHANCE IT WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED AROUND TEARTA AS TAKING EXOGENOUS TESTOSTRON A THAT IT SELF IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT BEAST NOW WITH ALL OF THAT SAID THERE ARE SOME SUPPLEMENTS OUT THERE THAT INCLUDE TESTOSTERONE AS A INGREDIENT THAT'S BEEN SNUCK IN TO VARIOUS FORMULAS THAT INCLUDE BLENDS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT YOU WANT TO BE AWARE OF THAT AND WE DID AN EPISODE BUT HOW TO DEVELOP A RATIONAL GUIDE TO SUPPLEMENTATION I HIGHLY RECOMMEND LISTNING TO THAT EPISODE ON AGAIN ITS TIME STAMPED AVAILABLE FREE AT HUBORMAN LAVDOT CAM AND ALL FORMATS BECAUSE IT TALKS ABOUT WHICH SUPPLEMENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE CLEAN QUOTIN QUOTE TO CONTAIN THE THINGS THAT YOU EXPECT THEM TO CONTAIN THERE'S MORE OR MORE EVIDENCE COMING OUT THAT A LOT OF SUPPLEMENTS INCLUDING SOME OM FOR INSTANCE A SUPPLEMENTS THAT CONTAIN TESTICAL OR THE EXTRACTS OF TESTACLES CAN CONTAIN TESTAOSTERONE WHETHER OR NOT THAT CAN SHUT DOWN YOUR OWN INDOGENOUS TESTOSTERON PRODUCTION IS CLEAR NO ONE'S REALLY EXPLORED THAT DETAIL BUT BASED ON EVERYTHING WE JUST TALK ABOU A TEAR TA IT STANDS TO REASON THAT IT MIGHT EITHER REDUCE IT OR SHUT IT DOWN IT'S JUST NEVER BEEN EXPLORED YET SO BY ALL MEANS MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TAKING IF YOU'RE TAKING SUPPLEMENTS BUT AGAIN THE MAJOR POINT HERE IS THAT FOR BOTH FEMALES AND MALES TAKING SUPPLEMENTS TO SUPPORT HEALTHY HORMONE PRODUCTION INCLUDING THINGS LIKE TONGA ALI IS NOT THE SAME AS TAKING HORMONES OR BYOIDENTICAL HORMONES WHICH INDEED CAN SHUT DOWN YOUR OWN INDOGENOUS PRODUCTION OF HORMONES AND THEREBY REDUCE BOTH EGG QUALITY AND THE CHANCE OF FRTILIZATION AND HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND SPIRM QUALITY AND THE CHANCE OF FERTILIZATION AND HALTHY PREGNANCY ANYTIME THERE'S A DISCUSSION ABOUT FERTILITY AND PREGNANCY THERE SEEMS TO ALSO BE A PARALLEL DISCUSSION ABOUT SEX DETERMINATION THAT IS WHAT FACTORS CAN INFLUENTS WHETHER OR NOT THE CHILED THAT'S BORN IS MALE OR FEMALE THAT IS WHETHER NOT IT HAS DOUBLE EX CHROMOZOMES SO ONE EX CHROMOZONE FROR MOM JONE EX CHROMOZONE FROM DAD BECAUSE THE EGG WAS FERTILIZED BY A SPIRM THAT HAD AN EX SEX CHROMOZOME THAT TWENTY THROUGHCHROMOZOME OR WHETHER OR NOT THE OFFSPRING IS MALE WHETHER NOT HAS THE EX CHROMOZONE FROMOM BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS CAN BE THE EX CHROMOZOME IN THAT EGG AND A WHY CHROMOZOME FROM THE SPIRM THAT FERTILIZED THAT PARTICULAR EGG NOW OF COURSE THERE ARE INSTANCES OUT THERE OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE EX EX WHY CHROMOZOMES OR EX WHY WHY CHROMOZOMES BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE GOING TO HAVE EITHER AN EX EX CHROMOZOME SO WE CALL THAT A FEMALE CARRIOTYPE NIGHT THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN GENOTYPE AND FINOTYPE BUT FEMALE CARROTYPE WOULD BE EX EX OR A MALE CARIOTYPE WHICH WOULD BE EX WHY OKEN NOW DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT IS THE EGG AN THE SPERM AND THE CHROMOZOMES THAT THEY CARRY THAT ARE GOING TO DETERMIN THE CROMAZOMES THERE'S A LOT OF LORE AND DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FACTORS THAT CAN BUY AS WHICH SPERM WILL FERTILIZE THE EGG AND THEREBY WHETHER NOT YOU'REGING TO GET AN O EXAXS FEMALE OR AN EX WHY MALE CROMAZOME AND THEREFORE OFFSPRING NOW NOT ONLY IS THE LORE AROUND THIS WHOLISHU OF SEX DETERMINATION A RATHER PROMINENT BUT IT IS ALSO SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL AND A PERHAPS EVEN INTERESTING SO FOR INSTANCE ARISTOTLE HIMSELF PROPOSE THAT IF A MAN IS THINKING ABOUT HIMSELF AND HIS OWN PLEASURE MORE THEN HIS PARTNER AND HER PLEASURE AT THE POINT OF EJACULATION THEN THE OFFSPRING WILL BE MALE ARISTOTLE ALSO ASSERTED THAT IF A MAN IS THINKING MORE ABOUT HIS PARTNER AND HER PLEASURE AT THE POINT IN WHICH HE EJACULATES WELL THEN THE OFFSPRING WOULD BE FEMALE OF COURSE WE HAVE ZERO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S ANY TRUTH TO ARISTOTLE'S THEORY THERE ARE NO DATA TO SUPPORT THAT IN FACT I'M NOT EVEN SURE HOW YOU WOULD RUN THAT EXPERIMENT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T REALLY LOOK AT PEOPLE'S THOUGHTS YOU'D HAVE TO RELY ON A HONEST SELF REPORT AND A EVEN IF PEOPLE WERE TO FAITHFUL REPORT WHAT THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT AAT THE MOMENT OF EJACULATION THIS WOULD EVOLVE A COURSE PRING PEOPLE INTO THE LABORATORY AND SOMEHOW A MEASURING OR ANALYZING THEIR THOUGHTS OR GATHERING THEIR THOUGHTS DURING THE A SEXUAL INTERCOURSE AT THE POINT OF EJACULATION THAN FIGURINGALE WHICH A BIOLOGICAL SEX WAS THE OFFSPRING ET CETERA A JUST A NEAR IMPOSSIBLE AND A PROBABLY NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT EXPERIMENT AN TO INVEST AR TIME DOING NONE THE LESS THERE CONTINUES TO BE A LOT OF LORE ABOUT WHAT DETERMINES THE SEX OF THE OFFSPRING MOST NOTABLY THERE'S A LOT OF LRE AND DISCUSSION AND RUMOR ABOUT THE IDEA THAT PARTICULAR SEXUAL POSITIONS AT THE POINT OF EJACULATION DURING INTERCOURSE CAN SOMEHOW BYUS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A PREGNANCY WILL BE EITHER RESULTING IN MALE OR FEMALE OFFSPRING NOW AGAIN THERE ARE ZERO DATA TO SUPPORT THIS AND YET THIS WHOLE NOTION OF SEX DETERMINATION S A REALLY INTERESTING ONE THAT PEOPLE SEEM TO BE SOMEWHAT OBSESSED BY SO MUCH SO THAT AGAIN IF YOU GO ON LINE OR IF YOU WERE TO TALK TO PEOPLE IN THE SORT OF A LET'S CALL IT WHOLISTIC OR PERIFERAL A HEALTH SPACES RELATED TO FERTILITY THERE IS DISCUSSION ABOUT OKE WHILE YOU TAKE THIS SEXUAL POSITION AT THE POINT OF EJACULATION TO GET A BOY AND YOU TAKE THAT SEXUAL POSITION THE POINT OF EJACULATION TO GET A GIRL ARE YOU DO A YOU DO THIS IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY OR THE LATER PART OF THE DAY AGAIN ALL FOR WHICH THERE IS ZERO DATA TO SUPPORT ANY KIND OF SYSTEMATIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WHAT I JUST DISCUSSED AND THE BIOLOGICAL SEX OF THE OFFSPRNG THAT SAID THERE ARE NOW EMERGING METHODS THAT PEOPLE ARE USING IN ORDER TO SEPARATE OUT THE SPERM THAT WILL INDEED GIVE RISE TO A MALE OFFSPRING VERSES A FEMALE OFFSPRING NOW THIS OF COURSE IS DONE IN THE CONTEXT OF INVETRO FERTILIZATION WE HAVEN'T TALK TOO MUCH ABOUT INVETRO FERTALIZATION BUT INVETROFERTILIZATION NVOLVES AS THE NAME SUGGESTS TAKING AN EGG AND TAKING A SPERM PARRING THEM IN A DISH THIS CAN BE DONE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS A BUT JUST TA BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE IVIF A PROCEDURE IVIF INVOLVES ADMINISTERING SUPRA MEANING GREATER THAN NORMAL SUPERPHYSIOLOGICAL LEVELS OF FHOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE AND LUTINIZING HORMONE DURING THE FALICULAR PHASE OF A WOMAN'S CYCLE WHAT THAT CAUSS IS THE MATURATION OF NOT JUST ONE EGG THAT WOULD BE OVULATED BUT MULTIPLE FOLICLS AND EGGS AND THEN OBULATION ITSELF IS SUPPRESSED ALSO THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATION OF EXOGENIUS HORMONES AND THEN UNDER ULTROSOUND GUIDANCE AND OBIGIUEAN GOES IN AND COLLECTS THE MATURE EGGS AND FOLICLS PUTS THEM IN A DISH AND THEN SPERM ARE DELIVERED TO THAT DISH AND THOSE COULD EITHER BE SPERM THAT WERE FROZEN PREVIOUSLY OR MORE TYPICALLY OR IDEALLY IT WOULD BE LIVESPERM COLLECTED THAT DAY THAT ARE A WASHED THROUGH A VERY  OF  STRAIGHT FORWARD PROCEDURE AND THEN THOSE SPERM EITHER ARE ALLOWED TO COMPETE FOR THOSE EGGS AND FERTILIZED THOSE EGGS AND ALLOW THEM TO ADVANCE TO A VERY EARLY EMBRYO STAGE BEFORE THOSE EMBRYOSE ARE FROZEN AND EVENTUALLY IMPLANTED INTO A WOMAN IN ORDER TO HAVE THEM BE CARRIED TO FULL TERM IDEALLY OR THEREIS A PRECEDURE IN WHICH SPECIFIC SPERM ARE SELECTED BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE BEST MORE PHOLOGY MOTILITY AND SO FORTH AND IN A PROCESS CALLED IXI I SEE S I IN WHICH THE SPERM THEMSELVES ARE LITERALLY FORCE TO FERTILIZE THAT PARTICULAR EGG NOW UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS TYPICALLY A COUPLE OR WOMAN IF SHE'S DOING THIS ON HERONE WITH A SPERM DONER WILL GET MULTIPLE FERTILIZED EMBRYOS THAT ARE CARRIED TO A MULTIMULTI CELLIER STAGE SO THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT THEY COULD GROW INTO A CHILD IF THEY WERE IMPLANTED INTO A VILABLE HOST NOW SOMETIMES THE SURUGAT SOMETIMES THE WOMAN WHO ANTS THE CHILD HERSELF AND UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOOK AT THE GENETIC MAKE UP INCLUDING THE CARIOTYPE OF THOSE EARLY NASONTO EMBRYOS IN WHICH CASE PEOPLE REALLY CAN SELECT THE SECTS OF THEIR OFFSPRING THAT IS THEY WILL HAVE SOME EMBRYOS THAT ARE EXXS SOME EMBRYOS THAT ARE EX UY IT'S VERY LIKELY ALSO THAT THEY WILL HAVE SOME EMBRYOS THAT HAVE CARIOTYPES OR GENOTYPES WHICH ARE NOT IDEAL IN THAT THEY WOULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO A MISCARRIAGE OR SOME OTHER GENETIC DEFECT AND SO TYPICALLY PEOPLE DO NOT SELECT TO IMPLANT THOSE EMBRYOS IF THEY HAVE THE OPTION TO IMPLANT EMBRYOS THAT ARE OF EITHER EXAXS OR EX UY CARRYOTYPE AND THE NORMAL CHROMOSOMO A ARRANGEMENTS THE FOR OBVIOUS REASONS SO THE THE WHOLE POINT HERE IS THAT SEX SELECTION IS POSSIBLE BUT ONLY USING IN VITRO FERTILIZATION THE OTHER THING THAT IS BECOMING CLEAR TO US IN MORE RECENT YEARS IS THAT SEX SELECTION IS ACTUALLY OSSIBLE AT THE LEVEL OF THE SPERM EVEN PRIOR TO FERTILIZATION THIS IS AN EMERGING DATA SET AND THIS IS LARGELY HAPPENING IN CLINICS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES BUT THERE ARE SOME CLINICS THAT HAVE FIGURED OUT METHODS IN WHICH THEY CAN TAKE A SPERM SAMPLE AND THEY CAN SPIN THAT SPRM SAMPLE IN A CENTER FUGE AT A RATE THAT SEPARATES OUT THE SPERM INTO WHAT ARE CALLED DIFFERENT FRACTIONS SO FOR THOSE YOU DONE ALIL BIT OF BIOLOGY WITH SENTERFUGES WHEN YOU SPIN ANY KIND OF SUBSTANCE THAT INCLUDES MULTIPLE THINGS IN IT OF DIFFERENT WEIGHTS WHEN YOU SPIN THEM THAT THINGS OF DIFFERENT WEIGHT SEGREGATE OUT INTO DIFFERENT FRACTIONS ALONG THE DEPTH OF THE TUBE AND THEN YOU CAN TAKE OUT ONE FRACTION OR THE NEXT SIMPLY WITHELITTLE PIPET OU TAKE OUT THE TOP FRACTION THE MIDDLE FRACTION AND SO FORTH AND WHAT THESE CLINICS HAVE FIGURED OUT IS THAT IF THEY SPIN THE SPERM SAMPLE AT THE CORRECT SPIN RATE THAT THE SPERM THAT WILL GIVE RISE TO MALE OFFSPRING AND THE SPERM THAT WILL GIVE RISE TO FEMALE OFFSPRING SEGREGATE OUT INTO DIFFERENT FRACTIONS ALLOWING THEM TO TAKE EACH OF THOSE FRACTION SEPARATELY AND TO APPLY THEM TO EGGS IF IT'S INVETRO FERTILIZATION AND GIVE RISE VERY RELIABLY CERTAINLY MUCH MORE THAN CHANCE TO EITHER MALE OR FEMALE EMBRYOS THEY ALSO OF COURSE CAN CHOOSE TO DO THIS OUTSIDE THE CONTEXTS OF INVETRO FERTILIZATION SO SOME PEOPLE ARE NOW OFTING TO HAVE THEIR SPERM SAMPLES SPUN OUT IN THIS WAY SEPARATE OUT THE SPERM THEY GIVE RISE TO MALE OR FEMALE OFFSPRING AND THEN TO ONLY USE THE FRACTION THAT THEY ARE INTERESTED IN RITES IF THEY WANT A BOY THOUGH YUSE ONE FRACTIONI THEY WANT A GIRL THE USE DIFFERENT FRACTION AND THEN TO USE THOSE FRACTIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT'S CALLED I U  OR INTRIUTERAN INSEMINATION WHICH IS AS THE NAME SUGGEST RATHER THAN HAVING THE MAN DELIVER THE EJACULATE WITH HIS PENUS AND THE SPERM WITH HIS PENUS THEY HAVE A A DEVICE YOU KNOW THE DEVICES ARE NOW COMMERCIALLY SOLD LEAVEN OT THEIR SOLD OVER THE COUNTER AND ON THE INTERNETS IF PEOPLE EVEN DO THIS AT HOME AND SO WHT THEIR DOING IS THEY'LL TAKE THE THE SPERM AN THEY'L DU I U IY IN ORDER TO BIAS THE PROBABILITY THAT THEY ARE GOINGTO GET A MALE OR FEMALE OFFSPRING AGAIND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S NOW EMERGING A IT'S NOTS COMMON PLACE MOST OF THE TIME PEOPLE A SIMPLY ROLL THE DICE AS AS IT WERE A BY HAVING EITHER A INTERCOURSE AND JUST HOPING FOR OR NOT CARING IF THEY GET A MALE OR FEMALE OFFSPRING A OR IN THE INSTANCE OF IVE YE SELECTING MALE OR FEMALE OFFSPRING SOMETIMES LARGELY ON THE BASIS OF THE CHROMOZOMAL ARRANGEMENTS SO OF COURSE A SOME PEOPLE MIGHT PREFER TO HAVE ONE OR THE OTHER BIOLOGICAL SEX AS THEIR OFFSPRING BUT OF COURSE THE HEALTHY CHROMOZOMAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE GOING TO BE PARAMOUNT FOR GETTING A HEALTHY CHILD AND A AS A MENTION BEFORE UNHEALTHY CHROMOZOMAL ARRANGEMENTS OR ABNORMAL CROMOZOMAL ARRANGEMENTS OFTEN LEAD TO MISCARRIAGE OR END OR BIRTH DEFECTS SO SELECTING FOR HEALTHY CHROMOZOMAL ARRANGEMENTS IS ALWAYS PARAMOUNT BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE SELECTING FOR BIOLOGICAL SEC AND INDEED SOME COUPLES WHO CAN CONCEIVE NATURALLY ARE OPTING FOR I U I IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SELECT BIOLOGICAL SEC BECAUSE OF THIS ABILITY TO SPIN OUT THE SPERMSAMPLES TO A DIFFERENT FRACTIONS AND SELECT THE MALE OR FEMALE SPERM THAT IS HAT THE SPERM THAT WOULD GIVE RISE TO A MALE OR FEMALE OFFSPRING SO THIS IS A A RAPIDLY EMERGING THEME BELIEVE IT OR NOT A WHO KNEW A AND OF COURSE IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ARISTOTLE'S ASSERTIONS ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT AT THE POINT OF EJACULATION NOR DOES THER HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH BODY POSITION AT THE POINT OF EJACULATION BUT I DO FIND IT RATHER INTERESTING THAT A EVEN IN THIS DAY IN AGE PEOPLE A SEEM TO BE CONTINUALLY PURSUING NEW AND DIFFERENT WAYS TO UNDERSTAND WHY ONE SPERM OR ANOTHER SPERM HAPPENS TO HOW FERTILIZE THE EGG AND WHEN THAT INFORMATION IS NOT OVAILBLE BECAUS FRANKLY IT'S NOT AVAILBLE YET WE DON'T KNOW WHY A SPERM CONTAINING A WHY CHROMIZOME OR SPRM CONTAIND EXCROMIZOMEIS MORE LIKELY TO FERTILIZE AN EGG EN THERE'S SOME IDEAS FOR INSTANCE THAT OLDER FATHERS TAN TO HAVE MORE DAUGHTERS IS OPPOSED TO SONS BUT WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT THE DATA IT'S PRETTY MEXED SO IF YOU'VE HEARD THAT AN BEFORE A HAS A PARTICULAR NICKNAME THAT A I'M NOT GOING T DISCRIME  PODCASTICAN LOOK IT UP ON LINE BUT A IF ANY OF YOU ARE AWARE OF ANY OTHER A KIND OF IDEALS OR LORE NO MATTER HOW RIDICULOUS OR CRAZY A PLEASE PUT THEM IN THE COMMON SEXCTION ON YOU TWO BE BE VERY CURIOUS TO LEARN ABOUT A THOSE MOSTLY OUT OF A A INTERESTING CURIOSITY BUT LOOK SOMETIMES THESE OUTRAGEOUS STORIES SUCH AS A NOTIONS A BODY POSITION AND WHAT HOW THEY INFLUENCE BIOLOGICAL SEX EVEN HOUGH THEY TURN OUT NOT TO BE TRUE TURN OUT TO BE INTERESTING FOR OTHER REASONS AND IN FACT NEXT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW BODY POSITION DURING SEXUAL INTERCOURSE CAN IN FACT INFLUENCE FERTILITY AND PREGNANCY SO ANOTHER COMMON THEME AROUND FERTILITY IN PREGNANCY THAT YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT IS THAT FOR COUPLES THAT ARE TRYING TO GET PREGNANT THAT DURING INTERCOURSE THEY SHOULD DO WHATEVER IT IS AT WORKS FOR THEM BUT THEN AFTER THE MAN EJACULATES THAT THE WOMAN SHOULD TRY AND POSITION HER ANKLES ABOVE HER HEAD OR SOMEHOW OTHERWISE TILT HER PELVIS BACK IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE RATE AND OR PROBABILITY THAT THE SPERM SWIM TOWARD  THE EGG AS OPPOSED TO THE OTHER DIRECTION NOW I TALK TO A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT OB G IENDS AND EUROLOGISTS THAT ARE FOCUS ON FERTILITY ABOUT THIS TOPIC AND IT TURNS THOUT YOU GET PRETTY MIXED ANSWERS AS TO WHETHER NOT THERE'S ANY VALIDITY TO THIS IDEA THAT THE WOMAN'S BODY POSITION AFTER THE MAN EJACULATES INSIDE OF HER CAN SOMEHOW INFLUENCE THE PROBABILITY OF PREGNANCY ONE GROUP OF EXPERTS TOLD ME THAT THERE IS NO REASON FOR A WOMAN TO NEED TO CONTINUE TO LIE DOWN ELEVATE THE ANKLES OR IN ANYWAY TILT HER PELVIS BACK IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE PROBABILITY OF SUCCESSFUL FERTILIZATION THE OTHER GROUP SUGGESTED THAT INDEED THERE IS A STRONG REASON TO BELIEVE THAT TILTING THE PELVIS BACK MAYBE EVEN KEEPING THE ANKLES ELEVATED AND HAVING WOMAN LI ON HER BACK FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES WITH THE PELVIS POSITION AT ABOUT TWENTY DEGREES S BACK IS IDEAL FOR OPTIMIZING FERTILIZATION I MEAN THEY WERE REALLY SPECIFIC ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS I FIND THIS INTERESTING THAT WITHIN THE A COHORT OF EXTREMELY WELL TRAINED EMDIES O I OBIGUENS AND YOUROLOGY FERTILITY TOX AND OBI GUYANS YOU SEE A SPLIT HAS NOTHING IN DO WITH WHETHER NOT THE A THE PHYSICION WAS MALE OR FEMALE A WERE THEIR TRAINING OR THEIR INSTITUTION NONE OF THAT BUT SEEM TO BE A SORT OF EVEN SPLIT BETWEEN THE TWO NOW GRANTED IT WASN'T THE LARGEST AMPLE SIZE THAT I COULDHAVE OBTAINED AND YET I DO FIND INTERESTING THAT THERE'S THIS A THI SPLIT IN THE OPINION ABOUT THIS ONE GROUP THE GROUP THAT SAID NO PALVIC POSITION DOESN'T REALLY MATTER  DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT IT'S NOK AN INFLUENCE A THE RATES OF FERTILIZATION ARGUE THAT THE SPERM SWIM VERY QUICKLY AND THAT IF THEY ARE RELEASED NEAR THE SERVICTS THAT ARE GOING TO SWIM VERY QUICKLY TOWARD THE EGG IN ORDER TO FERTILIZE IT REGARDLESS OF PELVIC POSITION THE OTHER GROUP SAID WELL YES SPERM SWIM QUICKLY AND EVEN IF THEIRE RELEASED RIGHT AT THE ENTRY TO THE SERVICS THAT THE SPERM STILL HAVE A LONG DISTANCE TO GO AGAIN IF YOU WERE TO SCALE THIS A ACCORDING TO THE SPIZE OF THE SPERMVERSOF SIZE OF A HUMAN BODY ENTIRE HUMAN BODY WHAT YOU'D A SCALE IT TO IS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN LOST ANGELIS AND SAN FRANCISCO WHEN IT NEEDS DO NDERGO THAT BASELY WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS OR SO ALTHOUGH AS WE MENTION EARLIER SPERMCAN SERVIVE QUITE A WHILE INSIDE OF THE WOMAN'S PODY MAY BE THREE OR FIVE DAYS AT LEAST SO IN BOTH CASES THEY ACKNOWLEDGITS ALONG DISTANCE BUT ON THE ONE HAND YOU HAVE A GROUP OF EXPERTS THAT ARE SAYING THE SPERM MOR LESS KNOW WHAT TO DO AND ARE GOING TO DO IT REGARDLESS OF THE POSITION OF THE WOMAN AFTER EJACULATION INSIDE HER AND THE OTHER GROUP SAYING NO WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO BUIAS THE LIKELIHOD THAT THE SPERM WILL FERTILIZE THE EGG OKI WELL SETTING ASIDE THE BASIC ARGUMENT THAT TILTING BACK AT THE PELVIS AND LYING STATIONARY OR SO FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AFTER SEXUAL INTERCOURSE AND EJACULATION IS NOT A A AN EXPENSIVE I YOU KNOW ENDEAVOR ALTHOUGH IT REQUIRES A LIT A BIT OF TIME A AND INFORSES PEOPLE TO REMAIN MOTIONLESS OR OR CLOSE TO MOTIONLESS AND THEY'RE NOT UP UP AND AROUND A MOVING ABALE ASIDE FROM THAT IT SAID RELATIVELY LOW INVESTMENT SO ONE ARGUMENT IS WELL IF IT COULD BUIAS THE LIKELIHOOD OF OF FERTILIZATION AT ALL AND PEOPLE WANTE AT PREGNENT WHY WOULDN'T THEY DO THAT O CASE THAT'S A REASONABLE ARGUMENT BUT OESN'T REALLY POINT TO THE MECHANISM THE THE ARGUMENTS THAT POINT TO A POTENTIAL MECHANISM ARE THAT YOU RECALL WHAT WE WERE TING ABOUT WE TALK ABOUT SPERM QUOLITY SPERM QUALITY INVOLVES A BUNCH OVE DIFFERENT MEASURES LIKE CONCENTRATION OF SPERM PFERMIAL LEADER SEAMEN A MORE FOLOGY OF THOSE SPERM HOW MANY ARE FORWARD MOTILE IT TURNS OUT THAT IN ANY ONE EJACULATE SAMPLE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FORWARD MOTILE AND YET FAST FORWARD MOTILE SPERM THAT ARE ALSO OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY MORE FOLOGY IS ACTUALLY QU IHT LOW AND SO THE IDEA HERE IS THAT YOU WANT TO GET AS MANY SPERM OF THE HIGHEST QUALITIES SWIMMING TOWARD THE EGG BECAUSE THOSE SPERM STAND THE HIGHEST PROBABILITY OF FERTILIZING THAT EGG IN IN FACT THIS RELATES TO SOME OF THE DISCUSSION WE ARE HAVING EARLIER ABOUT BEHAVIOR OLD DES AND DONTS FORSAKE OF INCREASING THE PROBABILITY OF FERTILIZATION AND THE ONE THAT IS MOST IMPORTANT HERE IS CANABAS TURNS OUT THAT THE DATA ON CANABAS REALLY DO SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD FROM A PARENTS AND TEACHERS I DON'T KNOW I DID TO HEAR THIS FROM A APPARENTS AND TEACHERS THAT A CANABAS CAN B DISRUPT THE SWIMMING STILES OF SPERM IN IN WAYS THAT ARE NOT SUPPORTIVE OF FERTILIZATION THAT IT CAN TURN MORE OF THI PERM INTO TWITCHERS ALTHO WHEN I LEARNED ABOUT THIS I WAS NOT INFORMED OF THE WORD TWITCHERS WHAT I WAS TOLD IS THAT IF YOU USE CANABAS THAT THE SPERM DON'T KNOW WHICH DIRECTION TO GO THAT THEIRE CONFUSED A ALMOST IMPLYING THAT THE THE SPERM THEMSELVES ARE ARE HIGH ON CANABAS WELL THAT CERTAINLY NOT THE ARGUMENT THAT I'M MAKING HERE BUT IT DOES SEEM TO BE THE CASE THAT PEOPLE WHO USE CANABAS EVEN WONTS THE SPERM THAT ARE GENERATED JURING THAT PARTICULAR MONTH OR TWO MONTHS DURING WHICH ARE AFTER WHICH THEY USE CANABAS HAVE LESS FORWARD MOTILITY AND POSSIBLY ALTERED MORPHOLOGY AS WELL O CA ONE O BE VERY CLEAR I DID NOT SAY THAT IF YOU USE CANABAS WANTS YOU ARE FOR EVER DISRUPTING THE MOTILITY AND MORE PHOLOGE OF YOUR SPERM I DID NOT SAY THAT WHAT I SAID IS THAT IF YOU USE CANABAS WANTS THAN THE SPERM THAT ARE GENERATED IN THE SIXTY DAYS AFTER THAT CANABAS USE ARE GOING TO HAVE A HIGHER INSCIDENTS OF DISRUPTED MOTILITY AND PERHAPS MORE PHOLOGY AS WELL O CA REMEMBER SPERM A CONTINUALLY GENERATED EVERY SIXTY DAYS OR SO AND SO IF YOU USE CANABAS WANTS YOU ARE NOT FOREVER DISRUPTING YOUR SPERM BUT IF YOU ARE USING CANABAS AND THAN YOU ARE LOOKING TO CONCEIVE IN THE NEXT SIXTY DAYS YOU ARE GOING TO BE REDUCING WE THINK SIGNIFICANTLY SO THE NUMBER OF QUALITY FORWARDLY MOTILE SPERM SO THE SIMPLE TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IS AVOID CANABAS USE ALTHOUGH IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE CANABAS AND AGAIN THERE ARE MEDICAL USES OF CANABAS AND BENEFICIAL USES OF CANABAS FOR CERTAIN POPULATIONS IT CAN BE BAD FOR OTHER POPULATIONS WE TALKED ABOUT THAT IN THE HUBERMANLADPODCAST ALL ABOUT CANABAS BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE CANABAS YOU SHOULD TRYING ABSTAIN FROM CANABAS IN THE TWO MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ATTEMPT TO FERTILIZE AND GET PREGNANT NOW I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY DATA ON HOW CANABAS USE BY THE WOMAN CAN INFLUENCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF FERTILIZATION AND PREGNANCY AND I WANT A COUCH THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION AROUND CANABAS UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF SOMETHING THAT CAME UP IN THE EPISODE THAT I DID ON CANABAS WHICH IS THAT FOR ABOUT HALF OF PEOPLE OUT THEIR MAIL AND FEMALE O CASE OF HEREEN WERE NOT DISTINGUISHING A BYBIOLOGICAL SEX ABOUT HALF OF PEOPLE THAT USE CANABAS REPORTED AS AN APHRODESIAC IT MAKES THEM WANT TO HAVE SEXUAL INTERCOR RSE MORE THAN IF THEY DON'T USE CANABAS AND FOR THE OTHER HALF IT ACTALLY HAS THE OPPOSITE EFFACT BY WAY OF AN INFLUENCE ON A HORMON CALL PROLACTIN WHICH SUPPRESSES THE DOPOMING SYSTEM THE TESTOSTERUN AND THE ESTERGENIC SYSTEM AND SO THE WHOLE IDEA THAT CANABAS IS AN APHRODEGIAC SEEMS TO BE TRUE FOR ABOUT HALF OF THE HUMAN POPULATION AND NOT FOR THE OTHER HALF THE HUMAN POPULATION SO I MENTION THAT BECAUSE I KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE A USE CANABAS AS AN APHRDESIAC THEY LIKE TO USE CANABAS BEFORE INTERCOURSE WAS ACTUALLY AM VERY SURPRISING TO ME TO DISCOVER WHEN I RESEARCH THAT CANABAS EPISODE THAT APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN ONE FIVE PER CENT AF WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT CONTINUE TO USE CANABAS DURING PREGNANCY AND THAT'S A VERY ALARMING STATISTIC AND EVERYTHING WE KNOW IS THAT THE USE OF CANABAS DURING PREGNANCY IS DETRIMENTAL TO THE HEALTH IN PARTICULAR THE BRAIN DEVELOPMENT TO THE FEEDUS SO THAT'S A REAL CONCERN I HIGHLY RECOMMEND WOMEN ABSTAIN FROM CANABAS USE DURING PREGNANCY AM TALKED HERE OBGUYAN ABOUT IT IF YOU ARE USING IT ALL ARE CONSIDERING USING IT ALL SO BASSTON WHAN I TOLD YOU EARLIER ABOUT THE FACT THAT CANABAS USE IS NOT GOOD FOR EGG QUALITY AND THE FACT THAT CANABAS USE CAN DESRUPT THE MOTILITY OF SPERM AND THEREFORE IS NOT GOOD FOR SPERM QUALITY AND IT CAN DESRUPT THE PATTERNS OF SWIMMING IN SPERM AN WAYS THAT REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF FERTILITY I THINK THE TAKE O MESSAGES CLEAR WHICH IS THAT WHETHER NOT AM YOU WANT TO BE A CANABAS USER OR NOT IF YOU ARE GOING TO TRYING CONCEIVE AND CERTAINLY WHILE YOUR PREGNANT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO AVOID THE USE OF CANABAS AND THAT IS SMOTE CANABAS AND VAPED CANABAS AND DURING PREGNANCY THE CONSUMPTION OF CANABAS EVEN AN EDIBLE FORMOR IN TINCTURE FORM IS ALSO GOING TO BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE DEVELOPING FEEDUS BUT OF COURSE WE STARTED THIS CONVERSATION IN THE CONTEXT OF BODY POSITION IN PARTICULAR AT THE POINT OF EJACULATION IN DETERMINING THE EX OF THE OFFSPRING AND OR THE LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING A SUCCESSFUL FERTILIZATION AND PREGNANCY AND I THINK THAT GIVEN THAT THE TILTING BACK OF THE PELVAS SO AGAIN THIS IS ELEVATING THE PELVAS BY ABOUT TWENTY DEGREES THING HAS TO BE EXACT EXACT BUT ABOUT TWENTY DEGREES FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES POST EJACULATION INSIDE OF THE THE WOMAN OR ISUPAS IF PEOPLE ARE USING I U A INTERUTERN INSEMINATION SINCE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE CONCENSIS AMONG THOSE EXPERTS THAT BELIEVE THAT PELVI TILT BACKWARD CAN BE BENEFICIAL FOR INCREASING THE PROBABILITY OF FERTILIZATION AND GIVEN THAT IT INVOLVES NO COST BUT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME SEEMS TO ME THAT IF YOU WANT TO GET PREGNANT THAT THAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND AS FAR AS I KNOW THERE'S NO INFORMATION NOR WAS I ABLE TO OBTAIN ANY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM EXPERTS ABOUT WHAT THE IDEAL BODY POSITION OF THE MALE IS AFTER EJACULATION IF THE GOAL IS TO INCREASE THE PROBABILITY OF FERTILIZATION AND PREGNANCY SWEEP BEEN TALKING ABOUT BEHAVORAL INTERVENTIONS SOME DUES AND SOME DONTS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO TO INCREASE O FERTILITY AND THE LIKELIHOOD THAT ANY FERTILIZED EGG WILL BE CARRIED TO TERM SUCCESSFULLY AND SOON WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT HINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE TO IMPROVE THEIR FERTILITY NOW KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS ENTIRE DISCUSSION IS ABOUT FERTILITY BUT ALSO REMEMBER AS WE DISCUSS TO THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE TRYING TO INCREASE YOUR FERTILITY IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO THINK ABOUT TRYING TO CREATE AND MAINTAIN OPTIMAL PHYSICAL HEALTH SO FOR PEOPLE THY ARE TRYING TO CONCEIVEEN FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT TRYING TO CONCEIVE OPTIMIZING YOUR FERTILITY STATUS WITH NOT YOUR MALE OR FEMALE IT'S ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO TARGET THOSE APPROACHES AND THERE ARE NOW LOT OF DATA SUPPORTING THE IDEA THAT ACUPUNCTURE OF ALL THINGS CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR IMPROVING BOTH FEMALE AND MALE FERTILITY AND SHOWED A WOMAN GET PREGNANT FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF OUTCOMES THAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THERE WILL BE A SUCCESSFUL PREGNANCY THAT IS CARRIED TO TERM NOT PREMATURE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH NOW FOR SOME OF YOU OUT THERE YOU MIGHT THINK OH OF COURSE ACUPUNCTURE ACUPUNCTURES BEEN KNOWN TO WORK FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS AND FOR IN IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT IT WOULD ASSIST WITH FERTILITY AN PREGNANCY FOR MANY VYIEW OUT THERE HOWEVER PROBABLY THINKING ACUPUNCTURE THAT SEEMS AND LIKE FRINGE SCIENCE BUT WHAT I CAN ASSURE YOU IS THAT THERE ARE NOW QUITE A FEW CLINICAL TRIALS FUNDED BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES LIKE THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH SHOWING THAT ACUPUNCTURE IS A VERY EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS INCLUDING FERTILITY AN PREGNANCY BUT FOR HORMON STATUS FOR STRESS RELIEF BUT EVEN FOR CHRONIC ILLNESSES OF DIFFERENT KINDS INCLUDING AUTOOMIAN ILLNESSIS SO THIS IS NO LONGER CONSIDERED FRINGE SCIENCE IN FACT ONE OF THE BEST LABORATORIES IN THE WORLD WORKING ON THIS IS A LABORATORY OUT OF HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL RUN BY A GUY NAME CHUFUMAM A CHUFU'S LAB HAS REALLY BEEN EXPLORING IN A MECHANISTIC WAY HOW THE DIFFERENT STIMULATION SITES THAT ARE USED IN ACUPUNCTURE TO WEAR THE NEEDLES ARE INSERTED TAPPEN TO NEURAL PATHWAYS THAT LINK THE DIFFERENT ORGANS OF THE BODY SO FOR INSTANCE THEY'VE FOUND THAT STIMULATION OF A PARTICULAR SITE ON THE LOWER LIMB CAN REDUCE INFLAMMATION TREMATICALLY THROUGHOUT THE BODY BY WAY OF NEURAL PATHWAYS THAT ORIGINATE IN THE LOWER LIMB AND EXTEND TO AREAS SUCH AS THE KIDNEY AND THE PANCREIS SO ALL THESE A QUOTICAL ANCIENT MAPS OF THE HUMAN BODY AS THEY RELATE TO ACUPUNCTURE ARE NOW BEING PARTE THAT THE LEVEL OF MECHANISM WHICH I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL BECAUSE IN NOT ONLY IS SHOWING US THAT SO MUCH OF WHAT HAS BEEN PURPORTED AND REPORTED IN THE LANDSCAPE OF ACUPUNCTURE ACTUALLY HAS AN UNDERLYING MECHANISTIC BASIS AND WITH ADDITIONAL MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF COURSE ALWAYS ARRIVE NEW AND BETTER PRACTICEAS THAT'S THE IDEA TO EVOLVE THESE FIELDS OF ACUPUNCTURE TO EVOLVE THE FIELDS OF MECHANISTHE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR BIOLOGY AND HEALTH AND SO THER ISSUE OF WHETHER NOT ACUPUNCTURE CAN ASSIST IN GETTING PREGNANT AND IN CARRYING A CHILD TO TERM AND FOR THAT CHILD TO BE HEALTHY A ARE REALLY STARTING TO EMERGE IN A MAJOR WAY AND A RATHER THAN GO INTO ALL THOSE DATA IN DETAIL WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT THERE ARE CLINICAL TRIALS AND DATA SUPPORTING THE F ACT THAT FEMALE FERTILITY ITSELF CAN BE SUPPORTED BY ACUPUNCTURE THROUGH SEVERAL MECHANISMS ONE OF WHICH IS THE BALANCING AND I REALIZE THAT THA SOMEWHAT TRICKY TERM AND A'LL DEFINE IT BETTER IN A MOMENT THE BALANCING OF HORMONES A CROSS THE OBULATORY FLASHMENSTRAL CYCLE INCLUDING REGULATING LEVELS OF EFFESATE SO THAT THERE ARE NOT TOO HIGH NOR TOO LOW AND RESTRICTING THE EFFISATES TO THE FELICULAR PASE OF THE OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE AS WELL AS USING ACUPUNCTURE TO IMPROVE THINGS LIKE BLOOD FLOW AND TE HEALTH OF THE OVERY ITSELF AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE AXIS SO ACUPUNCTURE CAN OPERATE AT THE CHEMICAL LEVEL IMPACTING HORMONES IT CAN ACT AT THE MECHANICAL LEVEL IMPACTING THE DIFFERENT TISSUES THROUGH WHICH THE EGG HAS TO PASS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH LIKEWISE ON THE MALE SIDE ACUPUNCTURE HAS BEEN SHOWNE TO IMPROVE SEEM IN VOLUME QUALITY OF SPERM SPERMOTILITY ET CETERA AND IN LARGE PART THROUGH CHANGES IN THE NURL PATHWAYS THAT INNERVATE THE VERY TISSUES AND VASCULAR IN PUT TO THE SCRODUM AND TESTACLES BECAUSE AS WE LEARNED EARLIER TEMPERATURE REGULATION OF THE SCROTUM IN TESTACLES IS SO VITAL FORGETTING HEALTHY SPERM AND INCREASING SPERM QUALITY IN ADDITION THERE ARE GOOD DATA TO SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT ACUPUNCTURE CAN INCREASE LEVELS OF TESTSTERONE FREE TESTOSTERONE AND THE SORTS OF HORMONES THAT ARE GOING TO SUPPORT HEALTHY HORMONE PRODUCTION AND SPERM PRODUCTION IN MALES AND THIS IS DISTINCT FROM APPLYING TESTOSTERONE FROM AN EXTOGEAN IS SOURCE RIGHT SO WHEN MERE TALKING ABOUT ACUPUNCTURE IN INCREASING LEVELS OF TESTASTEROM WERE TAK ABOUT INCREASING LEVELS INDOGENOUS TESTOSTRONE SO THOSE LAD EXCELLS CAN SUPPORT THE CERTOLY CELLS IN THE CERTOLY CELLS CAN MAKE THAT ANDRIGIMBINING PROTING AND YOU GET ENHANSED SPERMATIGENESIS YOU CAN FIND EVIDENCE FOR ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT FEATURES BOTH CHANGES TO THE CHEMICAL MILIU THAT IS THE HORMONES AND CHANGES THE MECHANICAL MILIU INCLUDING FOR INSTANCE IMPROVEMENT OF THE PATHWAYS LEADING FROM THE SEMINIFEROUS TUBULES TO THE EPIDITIMUS TO THE VAST DEFERENCE BASILY CLEARING OUT THE PLUMBING SO THAT MORE QUALITY EJACULATE CAN BE DELIVERED WHICH AFCOURSE IS GOING TO INCREASE THE PROBABILITY OF FERTILIZATION SO WHEN YOU HEAR THAT ACUPUNCTURE CAN IMPROVE THE LIKELIHOOD OF PREGNANCY O THAT'S AN ACCURATE STATEMENT FOR WHICH THER ARE NOW INCREASING AMOUNTS OF MECHANISTIC DATA IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW ACUPUNCTURE CAN BE USE TO CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVE FERTILIZATION AN PREGNANCY THEIR NUMBER DIFFERENT EXCELLENT REVIEWS ON THIS ON BOTH AS IT RELATES TO FEMALES AND AS IT RELATES TO MALES OM ONE OF THE BEST PAPERS THAT I HAPPEN TO LIKE IS ONE THAT WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO IN THE REFERENCES ENTITLED ACUPUNCTIORE AND URBLE MEDICINE FOR FEMALE FORTILITY AND OVERVIEW OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS SO A VIEW OF REVIEW OF REVIEWS THIS WAS PUBLISH RECENTLY IN UM TWENTY TWENTY ONE WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THAT AN OM THERE IS ALSO GOING TO BE ELINK TO A REVIEW THAT RELATES TO ACUPUNCTURE FOR MALE FERTILITY AND HORMON AUGMENTATION I SHOULD JUST MENTION BRIEFLY THAT IF YOURE GOING TO LOOK AT SCIENTIFIC PAPERS ONE THING THAT YOU'LL WANT TO CONSIDER IS ALSO LOOKING AT THE REFERENCES THAT THEY REFERENCE AND OF COURSE PAPERS TENDER REFERENCE OF TONO REFERENCES IN PARTICULAR IN REVIEWS SO WHAT YOULL WANT TO DO AS LOOKED FOR THE REFERENCES THAT ARE SHOWING OUT MOST OFTEN IN THE INTRODUCTION THOSE REFERENCES OFTEN ARE GOING TO BE THE MOST PROMINENT RECENT REVIEWS OR THE MOST IMPORTANT FINDINGS IN RECENT YEARS THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE BUT THAT'S OFTEN THE CASE IF YOU READ THE FIRST COUPLE OF PARAGRAPHS O THESE PAPERS AND THESE ARE OPENLY AVAILABLE IS FULL FULL TEX BY THE WAY ON LINE IF YOU GO TO THESE LINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE BEST PAPERS THE MOST RELEVANT PAPERS IN THE CONTEXTS OF ACCUPUNCTURE SUPPORTING FEMALE AND ACT PUNCTURE SUPPORTING MALE FERTILITY AND HORMON STATUS NOW I LIKE TO DISCUSS THINGS THAT BOTH MEN AND WOMEN CAN TAKE IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THEIR FERTILITY AND AGAIND AND AGAIN WHEN WERE TALKAMBOUT FERTILITY WERE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE CHILDREN BUT ALSO WERE TALKING ABOUT A BASIC MEASURE OF OVER ALL HEALTH' STATUS SO IFYOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO DOES NOT WANT TO CONCEIVE CHILDREN I STILL ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER R NOT YOU WOULD WANT TO DO CERTAIN THINGS ORE NOT DOE CERTAIN THINGS IN ORDER TO MAXIRMISE YOUR FERTILITY AS A MEANS TO MAXIMIZE YOUR VITALITY AND LONGEVITY BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT MAXIMIZING FERTILITY IS ABOUT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT'S SAID I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO CONCEIVE CHILDREN PERHAPS NOT RIGHT AWAY BUT IN THE FUTURE NWHAT I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE ARE SOME TOOLS AND INTERVENTIONS THAT IS THINGS THAT ONE CAN TAKE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THEIR HORMON STATUS BUT ALSO IN PARTICULAR THE QUALITY OF THEIR EGGS AND THE QUALITY OF THEIR SPERM IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM THE FIRST ON THE LIST OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE EGG QUALITY OR SPERM QUALITY IS ELL CARNATINE ELL CARNATINE IS PRESENT IN VARIOUS FOODS IN PARTICULAR IN RED MEATS BUT AGAIN IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO GET SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF ELT CARNATINE TO IMPROVE EGG QUALITY IN SPERM QUALL THE UNLESS YOUR GOING TO TAKE IT IND SUPPLEMENT FORM THE TYPICAL RECOMMENDATION BASED ON PUREVIEWED STUDIES THEYAVE SHOWN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN EGG QUALITY THAT IS CROMIZOMAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD OF FERTILITY OR PREGNANCY RATHER THE LIKELIHOOD OF SPERM BEING FORWARD FAST SWIMMERS AS SUPPOSED TO TWITCHERS ARE IMOTILE ON HAVING PROPERMORE FOLITY ALL THOSE MEASURES HAS BEE DEMONSTRATE TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED BY THE INGESTION OF AL CARNATINE HOW MUCH ELL CARNATINE WHELT THAT DEPENDS ON HOW YOUARE OBTAINING THE AL CARNATINE IF YOU'RE OBTAINING IT IN CAPSAL FORM ONE TO THREE GRAHAMS PER DAY OF CAPSAL FORM OL CARNATINE IS WHAT'S BEEN SUGGESTED TO IMPROVE EGG QUALITY AND SPERM QUALITY NOW ONE TO THREE GRAHAMS PER DAY CAN BE TAKEN ALL AT ONCE OR SPREAD OUT THROUGHOUT THE TWENTY FOR OUR CYCLE IT CAN BE TAKEN WITH OR WITHOUT FOOD DOES NOT SEEM TO MATTER AND WHEN TAKEN FOR A PERIOD OF THIRTY TO SIXTY DAYS DOES SEEM TO SIGNIFICULARLY IMPROVE ALL THE PERAMETERS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED FOR EGG QUALITY AND SPERM QUALITY NOW THE MECHANISM FOR THAT EFFECT IS PRETTY CLEAR ELL CARNATINE IS INVOLVED IN THE PROC ISTING OF LIPIDS FATS IN TERMS OF MITACONDREAL FUNCTION AND AS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE MITACONDREA ARE VITAL FOR THE ORGANIZATION AND ACTION OF THE SPINDLE THAT PULLS APART THE CROMOZOMES TAKING THAT SELL WITHIN THE FEMALE FROM DIPLOID TO HAPLOID WHICH IS ESSENTIAL YOU REALLY WANT JUST THE TWENTY THREE INDIVIDUAL CHROMAZALMO STRANDS YOU DON'T WANT CROMASALMO REPEATS IS ALSO INVOLVED IN THE ACTUAL FUSION OF THE EGG AS IT EXITS THE OVERY AND ENTERS THE OVULATION CYCLE MATICONDREARE ALSO IMPORTANT AS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE FOR THE FORWARD MOTILITY OF SPERM BECAUSE THE ENRICHMENT OF MITO CONDREAN THAT MID REGION JUST BEHIND THE HEAD THE CAUSE THE WHIPPING A FLAGULATION OF OF THE TAIL ALLOWING FOR FORWARD MOVEMENT AS WELL AS OTHER ASPECTS OF CELLER AND MOREPHOLOGY SO MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AS TO WHY AL CARNATINE SUPPLEMENTATION WOULD BE BENEFICIAL GAIN AT TO ONE TO THREE GRAMS PER DAY OVER A PERIOD ABOUT THIRTY TO SIXTY MONTHS IF YOU'RE HOPING TO CONCEIVE IN THE UPCOMING MONTHS RECOMMEND TAKING IT FOR LEAST THIRTY DAYS PRIOR TO THAT A OF COURSE BASED ON THE DAY TA WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THE CUMULATVE PROBABILITY FO COMETABILITY ET CETERA THERE'S NO REASON TO NOT CONTINUE TO TRY FOR PREGNACY BEFORE TAKING AL CARNATINE BUT AL CRNTINE IS GOING TO IMPROVE EGIN SPERM QUALITY AND SO YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY TAKE THE STANCE THAT EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM GETTING PREGNANT WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO MAXIMIZE THE QUALITY OF THE EGG THAT GETS FERTILIZED AND THE QUALITY OF THE SPIRM THAT FERTILIZES THAT EGG SO THAT'S ADDITIONAL RATIONAL FOR TAKING AL CARNATINE ONE IMPORTANT NOTE IF YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE EL CARNATINE IN ORAL FORM IN CAPSUL FORM IT CAN INCREASE SOMETHING CAL T MAO T MAO CAN CAUSE STIFFENING OF THE ARDERS YOU DON'T WANT T AMAO LEVELS TO GO TOO HIGH ONE WAY TO OFFSET THE INCREASES IN T AMAO CAUSE BY ORALEL CARNATINE IS TO TAKE SIX HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF GARLIC PER DAY A YOU ISOPOSE YOU COULD EAT CLOVES OF GARLIC THAT WOULD WORK JUST AS WELL BECAUSE GARLIC CONTAINS SOMETHING ALLED ALISON WHICH CAN OFFSET THE INCREASE IN T AMEO BUT SIX HUNDRED MILIGRAM CAPSILS OF GARLIC ARE GOING TO BE OR GARLIC EXTRACT RATHER IS GOING TO BE THE MOST A PROBABLY COSTEFFECTIVE AND A SIMPLEST WAY TO DO THIS A AN ALSO THEY ARE GOING TO CREATE THAT GARLIC SMELL SOME PEOPLE LIKE THE SMEL OF GARLIC SOME PEOPLE DON'T SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE ORILEL CARNATINE I SUGGEST ALSO TAKING SIX HUNDREDMILIGRAMS TO DAY OF GARLIC EXTRACT AND YOU CAN DO THAT AT ANY TIME THROUGHOUT THE DAY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE WITH THE AL CARNATINE THE NEXT ITEM ON THE LIST OF COMPOUNDS THAT HADE BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE EGG QUALITY AND SPERM QUALITY AND QUITE ROBUSTLY SO IS COENSI'M CUTEN KIL ANSI'M CUTEN IS SOMETHINGTHAT YOU CAN ACTALLY MEASURE LEVELS OF IN YOUR BLOOD MOST PHYSICIANS WILL SAY THAT THEY WANT TO SEE YOUR LEVELS OF COENSIM CUTEN TO BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN POINT FIVE AND TWO POINT FIVE IT'S GON TO DEPEND ON THE UNITS MOST PEOPLE I REALIZE HER O CAN A RUN OFF AND GET THEIR COCUTEN MEASURED A IT'S NOT INCLUDED IN MOST STANDARD BLOOD TES BUT IF YOU WERE TO MEASURE COCUTEN THAT'S THE RANGE THAT YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR THAT SAID MANY PEOPLE OP TO SUPPLEMENT WITH COCUTEN AND YOU'LL FIND THAT MANY FERTILITY DOX O BE GUAENS AND EURALOGIST THAT ARE TRYING TO ASSISTER MAIL PATIENTS WITH FERTILITY WILL SUGGEST COCUTEN BECAUSE AGAIN IT SUPPORTS THE HEALTH OF MYTOCONDREO MANOCONDREO  SO VITAL TO SO MANY ASPECTS OF THE FORMATION AND FERTILIZATION OF THE EGG AND SPERM THAT OF COURSE FERTILIZES THE EGG THE COENZIM CUTEN DOSAGES THAT ARE MOST OFTEN SUGGESTED AND THAT YOU'LL OBSERVE IN THE PURE RE VIEWED RESEARCH LITERATURE ON HUMANS I SHOULD ADD IS ONE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED MILIGRAMS PER DAY AND THE COENSIM CUTEN IS TAKEN GENERALLY WITH A MEAL AND IDEALLY A MEAL THAT CONTAINS FAT AND THERE IS EVEN SOME IDEA THAT TAKING COENSIM CUTEN WITH YOUR DINNER ASSUMING THAT DINNER INCLUDES SOME FAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO ADD ADDITIONAL FAT IS GOING TO BE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS AN TAKING COENS I'M CU TEN EARLY IN THE DAY ALTHOUGH THAT'S PROBABLY A DETAIL THAT'S O GETTING A LITTLE TOO FAR DOWN IN THE WEAT SO GET A HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF COENZIM CUTEN PER DAY WHETHER NOT YOU'RE A MAN OR WOMAN FOR IMPROVING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FERTILITY BY WAY OF IMPROVING EGG AN SPIRM QUALITY AND AGAIN IF YOUR SOMEBODY WHO JUST DOESN'T HAVE ANY PROM GETTING PREGNANT OR FEWRS ALREADY PRODUCING MANY SPIRM OF QUALITY MORPHOLOGY THIS IS ANOTHER CASE IN WHICH YOU COULD TAKE A STEP BACK INTO SHY WILL WHY WOULDN'T I WANT TO FURTHER OPTIMIZE THE QUALITY OF THE EG IN THE SPIRM BECAUSE THE QUALITY OF THE EGG IN THE SPIRM ULTIMATELY ARE GOING TO DETERMINE NOT JUST WHETHER NOT YOU HAVE A  SUCCESSFUL PREGNANCY BUT ARE GOING TO O DETERMIN ADMITTEDLY IN WAYS THAT WILL FOR EVER REMAIN CRIPTIC TO YOU BUT NONE THE LESS ARE GOING TO BE IMPORTANT INDETERMINING THE QUALITIES OF THE BRAIN TISSUE IN BODY TISSUE OF YOUR OFFSPRING THE THIRD ITEM ON THE LIST OF COMPOUNDS WHICH ARE COMMONLY SUGGESTED OR PRESCRIBED BY FERTILITY DOLKS NOWADAYS FOR MEN AND WOMEN WISHING TO CONCEIVE AND OR OPTIMIZE THEIR FERTILITY AS A BASIS FOR GENERAL VITALITY AND HEALTH IS INOCITOL KNOWING NOCTOL HAS MANY USES SO YOU'LL HEREABOUT THE USE OF ANOCITOL FOR REDUCING ANXIETY OR IMPROVING MOOD OR EVEN FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION WE TALKED ABOUT IN NOCITL AND PREVIOUS EPISODES OF THIS PODCAST A FRINCES I TALKED ABOUT INNOCITOL AND IN PARTICULAR TAKING NINE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF MIO AND NOCITOL PRIOR TO SLEEP WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I DO ALONG WITH THE OTHER SUPPLEMENTS THAT I TAKE AN RECOMMEND FER SLEEP SUCH AS MAGNESIUM THREE IN ATE APIGENAN AND FENINE IF YOUARE CURIOUS ABOUT THOSE YOU CAN SEE OUR NEWSLETTER ON SLEEP OR ARE PERFECT YOUR SLEEP EPISODE OR THE MASTER SLEEP EPISODE TOCS OF A BEHAVIORAL AND SUPPLEMENTATION BASE TOOLS FOR IMPROVING SLEEP BUT MYOW NOCITOL IS NOT JUST SUGGESTED FOR OR PRESCRIBED FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE WISHING TO GET PREGNANT AND FOR GENERAL HEALTH BUT MY OW NOCITOL IS OFTEN RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE THAT WANT TO IMPROVE EGG ANSPIRM QUALITY BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT IT CAN POSITIVELY IMPACT INSOLEN SENSITIVITY INSOLEN SENSITIVETY MIGHT SOUND LIKE A BAD THING A TO BEOPLE OUT THERE BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU WANT TO BE INSOLEN SENSITIVE THE LASTHING YOU WANT IS TO BE INSOLENT INSENSITIVE INSOLENT INSENSITIVITY IS ASSOCIATE WITH TIGHT TUDIBETIES WITH O BSITY AND EVEN FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT CHALLENGE WITH OBCITY YOU WANT YOUR SELLS TO BE INSOLEN SENSITIVE YOU DON'T WANT A LOT OF INSOLENT FLOATING AROUND IN YOUR SYSTEM WITH YOUR CELLS UNABLE TO USE THAT INSOLENT THAT'S EALLY WHAT INSOLENT INSENSITIVITIES ABOUT MIO AND OCITOL AT DOSAGES OF ONE TO FIVE GRAHMS PER DAY PRETTY HIGH ONE IFIE GRAMS PER DAY KEEPING O MIND THAT A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS IS ONE GRAM HAS BEEN SUGGESTED TO IMPROVE EG QUALITY AN SPERM QUALITY NOW ONE POINT OF A I WOUNT TAKE CAUTION BUT OF NOTE IS THAT MION OCITOL CAN REDUCE ANXIETY ND IT CAN BE A SLIGHT SEDATIVE WHICH IS WHY A SOME FOLKS INCLUDING MYSELF TAKE ALMOSTO GRAM NINE HUNDRED MLIGRAMS PRIOR TO SLEEP IF YOURE GOING TO TAKE FIVE GRAMS OF MY OWND OCITOL YOU WOULD WANT TO RESTRICT THAT TO THE LATE EVENING OR SECOND HALF OF YOUR DAY AND I DON'T SUGGEST STARTING THAT HIGH WULD START WITH ONE OR TWO GRAMS AND THEN WORKING YOUR WAY UP SEEING WHAT YOU CAN TOLERATE O IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF A ANTA ANXIETY IN DROUSINESS THAT IT PRODUCES ONE TO FIVE GRAHMS PER DAY OF MIO AND OCITOL IS WHAT SUGGESTED FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN WISHING TO IMPROVE EG HEALTH AND SPERM HEALTH BUT FOR WOMEN IT'S ALSO OFTEN SUGGESTED TO INCLUDE ALSO O CASE OF TO TAKE MYON OCITOL BUT TO ALSO TAKE DE CIRO IN OCTL DE CIRO AND OCITOL HAS ELEMENTS IN IT THAT CAN BE BOTH PRO AND ANTI ANDROGENIC ANDROGENS ARE THINGS LIKE TASTOSTRON AND RELATED MOLECULES THERE ARE A NUMBER DIFFERENT CAUSES OF INFERTILITY AND DESTRUPTION TO EGQUALITY AGE BEING THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTOR BUT ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT AND VERY COMMON FACTOR EVEN AMONG YOUNG WOMEN WHO ARE OF FERTILE AGE IS HAVING TOO MANY ANDROGENS AND AS IT RELATES TO SOMETHING CALL POLY SYSTICA VARYAN CYNDRUM AND WE'LL DO AN ENTIRE EPISODE ABOUT MEN OF PAS AND PICIOES AND A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS THAT RELATE TO FERTILITY BECAUSE IT'S AN ENTIRE AND VERY INTERESTING OTHER DISCUSSION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE BUT THE RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WOMEN TAKE ONE TO FIVE GRAHMS OF MIO AND OCITOL BUT ALSO DE CIRO AND OCITOL BECAUSE OF THE WAYS THAT IT CAN BALANCE ANDROGENS AND OFFSET SOME OF THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF POLYSISTIC O VARIAN INDRUM OR EVEN FOR WOMEN WHO DO NOT HAVE POLYSYSTICAL VARYAN CYNDRUM BECAUSE OF THE WAYS THAT DE CIRO AND OCITOL CAN BALANCE ANDROGENS IND WAYS THAT ARE BENEFICIAL THE DOSAGES OF DE CIRO AND OCITL THAT ARE RECOMMENDED TEN TO BE ONE TWENTY FIFTH TO ONE FORTIETH OF THE MIO AND OCITOLDOS YOU HAVE TO GET OUT YOURE CALCULATOR REMEMBER A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS EQUALS ONE GRAHM SO FIGURE OUT IF YOU'RE TAKING ONE GRAM OF MIO AND OCITOL PER DAY OR TWO GRAMS YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO CONVERT THAT TO MILIGRAM SO T LET THY YOARE TAKING TWO GRAMS OF MIOAN OCITOL PER DAY THAT'S TWO THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAN YOU'D WANT TO DIVIDE THAT BY TWENTY FIVE AND THAT'S HOW MANY MILIGRAMS OF DE CIROAN OCITOL YOU WOULD WANT TO TAKE AS WELL OR YOU COULD GO WITH THE LOWER ANDOSE AND DIVIDE IT BY FORTY AND TAKE THAT NUMBER OF MILIGRAMS OF DE CIROAN OCITOL ALONG WITH THE AN OCITOL AGAIN I'LL BE TAKING IT LATER IN THE DAY IS GOING TO BE GOOD IT'S NOT CLEAR AT ALL THAT TAKE GEN WITH FOOD OR WITHOUT FOOD MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE WHATSOEVER SO I WOULD SUGGEST YOU DO EITHER KEEP IN MIND IS I'M I'M DISCUSSING THESE RECOMMENDATIONS I MAY CALL THEM PRESCRIPTIONS BUT NONE OF THESE ARE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND OF COURSE YOU SHOULD ALWAYS DISCUSS ANY SUPPLEMENTS THAT YOUR PLANNING TO TAKE OR STOP TAKING FOR THAT MATTER WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN I DON'T SAY THAT TO PROTECT ME I SAY THAT TO PROTECT YOU YOU ANY TIME YOU'RE GING TO ADD OR CHANGE SOMETHING IN YOUR OVER ALL HEALTH REGIMEN YOU WANTED DISCUSS THAT WITH YOUR A TRUSTED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL TYPICALLY I WOULD HOPE ABOARD CERTIFIED EMPTY THE FOURTH ITEM IN THE LIST OF COMMONLY SUGGESTED SUPPLEMENTS FOR MEN AND WOMEN WISHING TO OPTIMIZE EGG AND SPIRM QUALITY RESPECTIVELY IS OMEGATHREE FATIACIDS AND NOW HERE WE'RE TALKING OUT SOMETHING THAT COULD BE OBTAINED FROM FOOD AND CAN BE OBTAIN FROM FOODS IF YOUR CONSUMING A FATTY OCEAN FISH THINGS LIKE A SARDINES ANCHOVYES SAMIN WITH THE SKIN CHANCES ARE YOU'RE GOING TO GET SOME QUALITY OMGA THREES O MEGATHREES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE IND PLANT BASE SOURCES OM INS ALSO OFALBLING CRILL FOR THAT MATTER A BUT MOST PEOPLE FIND IT DIFFICULT TO REACH THE THRESHOLD REQUIRED FOR OPTIMIZING MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH THAT IS THE THRESHOLD OF THE E P A O CENTIAL FATIACIDS AND SO FOR THAT MATTER I'VE SUGGESTED BEFORE IN THIS PODCAST AND MANY FERTILITY DOCS WILL SUGGEST THAT THERE PATIENTS TAKE OMEGATHREE FATIACIDS AND SUPPLEMENT FORMIN COULD BE TAKEN IN LIQUID FORMER AND CAPSIL FORM BUT ENOUGH OF THOSE THAT YOU'RE GETTING AT LEAST ONE GRAM PER DAY OF THE E P A FORM OF OMEGA THREES SO CASE SO AT LEAST ONE GRAM PER DAY AND AS HIGH AS TWO OR EVEN THREE GRAM'S PER DY OF THE E P A FORMS YOU'LL NEED TO LOOK AT THE PACKAGING BECAUSE OFTENTIMES YOU'LL SAY HIGH POTENCYOMEGA THREES I YOU'LL SAY UN YOU KNOW IT FIFTEEN HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF OMEGA THREES BUT THAT'S NOT FIFTEEN HELERED HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF THE E P A FORM OU' LOOK ON THE BACK OT LABEL AND YOU'LL SAY EACH SERVING CONTAIND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILIGRAMS OF E P A YOU WANT TO GET ABOVE THAT ONE GRAM DOSAGE PER DAY AND AS HIGH AS THREE GRAM SPER DAY OF THE E P S THE MOST COST OFFECTIVE WAY TO DO THAT IS GOING TO BE LIQUID FORMOMEGAS BUT THAT'S A LOBI IN CONVENIENT FOR MANY PEOPLE IN SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE TASTE THAT'S WHY THEY RELY ON THE CAPSIL FORMOMEGAS AND OF COURSE THERE ARE COMPOUNDS THAT CAN IMPACT FERTILITY STATUS QUALITY OF EGGS QUALITY OF SPERM NOT BY ADJUSTING MITACONDRIA OR INSOLEN SENSITIVITY OR CREATING A GENERAL MILEU OF SUPPORT FOR THE EGG IN THE SPERM PRODUCTION AND FUNCTION SUCH AS THE COMPOUNDS THAT IE JUST LIST IT OFF DO BUT RATHER COMPOUNDS THAT INFLUENTE THE HORMONS INVOLVED IN THE GENERATION OF SPERM IN THE GENERATION OF THE EGGS IN VOLVED IN THE OVULATORY CYCLE IN THES PERMATEGENISICYCLE THAT IS NOW THESE ARE GOING TO COME IN DIFFERENT FORMS AND I WANTO JUST EMPHASIZE THAT THE SUPPLEMENTS THAT DO THIS THAT A JUST HORMONS IN THESE WAYS THAT COULD BE BENEFICIAL ARE DISTINCT FROM HORMON THERAPY OR BYO IDENTICAL HORMONS OK DISTINCT FROM HORMONTHERAPY OR BIIDENTICAL HORMONS BECAUSE AS WE DISCUSSE EARLIER WHEN YOU TAKE A HORMON LIKE TESTASTRON OR EVEN ESTRGEN FOR THAT MATTER FROM AN EXOGENOUS AND OUTSIDE SOURCE YOU ARE GOING TO DISRUP THE FEED BACK PATHWAYS INSIDE OF YOUR BODY AND YOUREGIN A SHUT DOWN YOUR OWN INDOGIONOUS PRODUCTION THE SUPPLEMENTS IM ABOUT TO DESCRIBE DO NOT DO THAT AND YET CAN ADJUST LEVELS OF HORMONES IN MORE SUBTLE WAYS THAT CAN BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE IMPROCESS OF MAXIMIZING FERTILITY FOR MALES AND FOR FEMALES THE FIRST OF WHICH ON THIS LIST THAT'D LIKE TO DISCUSS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IN PREVIOUS PODCAS AS WELL WHICH IS A SUBSTANCE CALLED TONGAT ALI TONGA ALI ALSO GOES BY OTHER NAMES AND BUT WHEN TAKEN AT FOUR HUNDRED MILIGRAMS PER DAY SOMETIMES SEPARATE INTO TWO DOSAGES POTYPICALLY TAKEN AS ONCE A DAY EARLY IN THE DAY BECAUSE IT BE A LITTLE BIT STIMULATING ALTHOUGH NOT ANXIETY PROVOKE M NEVER HEARD OF THAT CAN BE LOBUT STIMULATING BUT FOUR HUNDER MILIGRAMS A DAY OF TONGA AL HAS BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE FREE TESTOSTERONE BY WAY OF REDUCING SOMETHING CALLED SEXTORMON BONINGLOBULANE ITS ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE LUTINIZING HORMONE THE NET EFFECT OF WHICH HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS A SUBTLE BUT SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN LIBIDO AND SOME OF THE OTHER PERAMETERS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED ANDROGENS LIKE FREAE TESTOSTRONE IN MALES AND FEMALES SO IN NUMBER PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE TAKING TONGAALI IN THIS WAY FOUR HUNDRED MILIGRAMS PER DAY RESTEACTED TO THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY WITH OR WITHOUT FOOD PEOPLE LWAYS ASKED YOU NIDE TO CYCL TONGA ALI I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY NEED TO CYCL TONGA ALI IN FACT IT TENDS TO WORK BETTER MEANIG THE EFFECTS ON LIBIDO AND SOME OTHER HORMON PROFILES TENS TO INCREASE SOVER TIME AGAIN TONGAALI IS AN OPTION AS CERTAINLY NONE OF THESE THINGS ARE REQUIREMENTS HAN WERE SIMPLY LISTING OFF OPTIONS BUT MANY PEOPLE BOTH MALES AND FEMALES SEEM TO BENEFIT FROM AND LIKE TONGA ALI EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT SEEKING TO CONCEIVE THERE IS NO REASON THINK THAT TONGA ALI DIRECTLY IMPROVES A ER SPIRM QUALITY EXCEPT IN MALES THE INCREASE IN ANDROGEN CREATED BY TONGA ALI SUPPLEMENTATION CANINDEED LEAD TO INPROVED SPERMATIGENESIS SO THERE IS A GROWING AMOUNT OF DATA IN THIS RESEARCH LERGUR ON TONGAALI MANY PEOPLE FIND IT BENEFICIAL AND SO IT SOMETHING THAT BOTH MEN AND WOMEN WISHING TO CONCEIVE AND OR OPTIMIZE THEIR FERTILITY JUST AS A GENERAL HEALTH PERAMETER MIGHT WANT TO EXPLORE THE OTHER SUPPLEMENT THAT'S BEEN SHOWN TO INPROVE BOTH EG QUALITY AND SPERM QUALITY AND THERE I AM REFERRING TO A NUMBER DIFFERENT PERAMETERS RELATE TO EQUALITY ANS PIRM QUALITY AS WELL AS TO INCREASE LIBIDO FAIRLY SUBSTANTIALLY IS A SUBSTANCE CALLED SHILAGI SHILAGI A SPELLED ES H I EL A G I T SHILAGI IS ACTUALLY A A COMPOUND THATS USED IN IROVATIC MEDICINE BUT THERE SOME REALLY GOOD RESEARCH STUDIES EXPLORING THE SUPPLEMENTATION WITH SHILAGI AT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTEE MILIGRAMS TWICE PER DAY AND THIS HAS BENLOOKED AT A MALES AND IN FEMALES IT DOES SEEM TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE TWO HORMONES ONE IS TESTASTERONE AND THE OTHER IS PHOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE AND FOR THAT REASON SCHILAGI AS OFTEN CONSIDERED A TONIC THAT PEOPLE USE BOTH AS AN AFRODIGIAC A INCREASE LIBIDO AS WELL AS TO ICREASE FERTILITY NOW ONE NOTE OF CAUTION IF YOURE WOMAN AND YOU'RE CONSIDERING TAKING SHELAGY IN ORDER TO INCREASE TESTOCTERON AND POLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE KEEP IN MIND THAT THE OVULATORY CYCLE IS THIS VERY TIGHTLY REGULATED CYCLE IN WHICH YOU WANT LOW BUT ELEVATED LEVELS OF FOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE EARLY IN THE FILICULAR PHASE THAN IT PEAKS RIGHT BEFORE OBULATION AND THEN LOW LEVELS OF FOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE IN THE CSECOND HALF OF YOUR CYCLE FOR THAT REASON USING SHIELAGI CHRONICALLY AREAND THE ENTIRE COURSE OF YOUR OVIATORY CYCLE COULD BE A LITTLE BUT RISKY AND I'D RECOMMEND THAT YOU TALTURE A OBIGI WYAN A PRIOR TO DOING THAT OR IF DOING THAT AT ALL FOR MALES IT'S A LITTLE BUT LESS OF AN ISSUE BECAUS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER SPIRM AR CONSTANTLY BEING GENERATED AND THE PRESENCE OF EFFASAGE IS GOING TO INCREASE PERMATAGENESIS NOW SHIELAGI IS NOT EFFASAGE ITSELF SHELAGI STIMULATES THE RELEASE OF EFASAGE END IT STIMULATES THE RELEASE OF TESTACERON SO AGAIN THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT IT WOULD SHUT DOWN YOUR INDOGEONIS TOSTACERONER EFASAE PRODUCTION AM ALTHOUGH THERE ARE LIMITED AMOUNT OF DATA THTHHAV REALLY EXPLORED THAT IN DETAILF MANY PEOPLE U SHIELAGI IN ORDER TO INCREASE THEIR TESTOCERON EFFIS AGE THEIR LABIDO AND VARIOUS ASPECTS OF SPIRM HEALTH THE AGAIN THE DOSAGES OF SHELAGI ARE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MELEGRAMS TWO TIMES PER DAY ONE ISSUE WITH SHEELAGI AS IT OFTEN COMES AS A AS A TAR WHOSE LITTLE HARD TO MEASURE OUT THE DOSAGES YES A TAR ITS THIS AM CAN OF THICK GUMMY SUBSTANCE THAT YOUS PUST TO DISSOLVE IN WATER AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE YOU TAKE A LITTLE BEAD AND DISSOLVED IN WATER IT IS OFVALABE N CAPSIL FORM WHERE THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THE DOSAGE AS A LOB A IS MADE A LOBI EASIER BUT OF COURSE AS WITH ANY SUPPLEMENT I RECOMMEND STARTING WITH THE LOWEST POCIBLE DOSAGE SO YOU MIGHT AS ON O TART WITH A SMALL VERY SMALL BEAD OF SHELAGY A DISSOLVED IN WATER TAKIN ONCE PERDAY AND THEN INCREASE THE DOSAGE AS NEEDED IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE EFFECTS THAT YOU WANT THINGS LIKE SHELAGI START TO A BRING US INTO THE REALM OF A WAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A LITTLE BIT UNWIELDY RIGHT HERE WERE SAYING YOU CAN'T REALLY CONTROL THE DOSAGE NOW YOUR TALKING ABOUT HORMONES THAT NEED TO BE TIGHTLY REGULATED AT LEAST FOR FEMALES ACROSS THE OVERIAN CYCLE FOR MALES YES IT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE TESTOCTERONE AND EFFIS AGE IMPROVE SPERMOTILITY AND SPIRM COUNT PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY NO REASON TO THINK THAT YOU COULDN'T DO THAT CHRONICALLY WITHSHEELAGI AND YET I DO WANT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SHELAGI AS THIS BLACK TAR SUBSTANCE IS CONTAINS A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN FACT IT COMES FROM A MINERAL PITCH WHAT IS THAT ITS THAT COMES FROM THE LITERALLY THE DIRT AN PLANTS THAT HAVE BEN COMPRESSED BY ROCKS IN THE HEMALAA IS PRETTY ESOTERIC STUFF WHEN REALLY COMES DOWN TO IT BUT THE BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF SHELAGI IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALE SEEM TO BE RELATED TO THE FACT THAT IT IS HIGHLY ENRICH AND SOMETHING CALLED FULVIC ACID ANFULVIC ACID IS INVOLVED IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT CELLER PROCESSIES NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH AT LEAST IN THIS CONTECT IS THE TRANSPORT OF MOLECULES ACROSS CELL MEMBRANES AND FOR HORMONES TO HAVE THEIR EFFECT THEY NEED TO CROSSSELL MEMBRANES ON THE OUTSIDE IN THE INSIDE OF THE CELF AM SO MAYBE THAT'S HOW ITS HAVING ITS EFFECT AGAIN THE MECHANISMS OF EXACTLY HOW SHELAGI INCREASES TESTOSTRONE AN EPIS AGE AND THEREBY LEBIDO EDQUALITY AND SPIRM QUALITY AREN'T ENTIRELY CLEAR BUT FOR A THE MORE ADVENTUROUS OF YOU OUT THERE A ONE EXPERIMENT WHICH SEELOGY WHETHER NOT YOU'RE TRYNG TO CONCEIVE OR OR NOT A IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO CONSIDER BUT OF COURSE DO TALK TO YOUR PHYSICION THE NEXT COMPOUND THAT I WANT AN DISCUSS IS ZINC AND THAT THIS DISCUSSION MAINLY PERTAINS TO MALES ALTHOUGH I A OF COURSE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT FEMALES SHOULD GET THE RECOMMENDED DAILY A ALLOWANCE OF ZINC EACH DAY MALES ON THE OTHER HAND SEEM TO BENEFIT FROM HAVING ADDITIONALLY HIGH LEVELS OF ZINC INTAKE NOW THAT CAN BE OBTAINED THROUGH FOODS YOU KNOW YOU OFTEN HERE OW YOU NOW OYSTERS ARE ENRICHED IN ZNC AND AND THE OYSTERS ARE NAPHRODIGIAC YOU KNOW I N KNO WHO'S DOING THE MARKETING FOR OYSTERS BUT IT'S IT'S REALLY A TERRIFIC I THINK THAT SEEMS TO HAVE PERSISTED AND A AND MAYBE IT'S TRUE A THEY ARE THE OYSTERS ARE EN RICH IN ZINC WHAT IS ZINC DO FOR FERTILITY WELL IN MALES WE KNOW BASED ON A REALLY NICE SET OF STUDIES THAT ZINC DOSAGES THAT ARE PRETTY HIGH OF ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILIGRAMS TAKEN TWICE PER DAY IAT'S QUITE A LOT WITH MEALS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE TESTOSTRONE END DIHYDRA TOSTOSTERONE AND THIS PROBABLY SHOULDN'T COME AS A SUPPRISE TO US IT TURNS OUT THAT ZINC IS HIGHLY ENRICHED IN HUMAN TESTIES AND IN THE TESTIS OF OTHER ANIMALS INCLUDING FISH AND OTHER MAMMALS IN WAS ACTUALLY IN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE THAT IT WAS OBSERVED IN FISH THAT ZINC LEVELS SKY ROCKET IN THE TESTIS OF FISH DURING THEIR BREEDING SEASON SO ZINC IS CORRELATED WITH INCREASES IN BREEDING BUT YOU NEVER KNOW WHICH DIRECTION THAT CORRELATION IS RUNNING TURNS OUT THAT ZINC IN BOTH ANIMALS CLING FISH OTHER MAMMELS AND IN HUMANS STRONGLY IMPACTS THE INSEMATIC FUNCTIONS IN THE TESTIS INCLUDING THE FUNCTION OF ANDROGAN BINDING PROTINE SO IT SEEMS THAT HIGH LEVELS OF ZINC CAN INCREASE PERMATAGENESIS AND TESTOSTRONE LEVELS VERY SIGNIFICANTLY THIS WAS EXPLORED IN A REALLY NICE STUDY THAT I'LL PROVIDE A REFERENCE TO ITS AN OLDER STUDY I REALY LIKE THAT IT'S CALLED EFFECT OF ZINC ADMINISTRATION ON PLASMOSTOSTOSTRONE DIHYGRA DISCTRONE AND SPERM COUNT THIS IS BUT JUST ONE STUDY AMONG A MANY NOW A THIS DATES BACK TO NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE BUT THERE BEEN A STUDYE SUBSEQUENTLY THE POINT TO THE FACT THAT SUPPLEMENTATION WITH ZINC AT THOSE HIGH LEVELS CAN REALLY BE A HELPFUL IN TERMS OF INCREASING SPERM COUNT TESTOSTRONE AND EVEN TESTICULAR SIZE OF ALL THINGS SO ONE IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT TAKING ZINC THIS HUNDRE AND TWENTY MELIGRAMS OF ZINC TWO TIMES DAILY A DEFLY NEAS TO BE DONE WITH MEALS IF YOU'VE EVER TAKEN ZINC ON AN EMPTY STOMACH EVEN IF YOU JUST TAKE FIFTEEN OR THIRTY MELIGRAMS OF ZINC YOU CAN FEEL VERY NOCIOUS NOT WELL FOR A FEW HOURS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE TAKING ZINC WITH FULL MEALS THIS WOULD MEAN THAT YOU'RE TAKING A IN AT LEAST TWO FULL MEALS PER DAY A I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT ZINC SUPPLEMENTATION DID NOT APPEAR TO IMPACT GANATATROPE IN RELEASING HORMONE OR PROLACTAN SO IT SEEMS TO BE A FAIRLY TARGETED EFFECT ON THE TESTOSTRONE AND RELATED PATHWAYS AND MALS AS FAR AS I KNOW THERE HAVE NOT BEEN SYSTEMATIC EXPLORATIONS OF THE EFFECTS OF HIGH LEVELS OF ZINC ADMINISTRATION ON FEMALES I WOULD HOPE THAT THOSE STUDIES WOULD SOON BE DONE BUT MEANWHILE IF YOUR MALE AN YOUR INTERESTED IN IMPROVING SPIRM QUALITY AND YOUR TESTSTERON LEVELS OVER ALL FOR WHATEVER REASON ZINC LIKELY IS A GOOD CANDIDATEN THAT PRETTY MUCH SUMMERIZES THE COMPOUNDS THAT MEN AND WOMEN SHOULD TAKE IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZES EG QUALITIES PIRM QUALITY AND FERTILITY AND THEN OF COURSE WE SAR TO ENTER THE LANDSCAPE OF OTHER THINGS THAT MEN AND WOMEN CAN TAKE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE FERTILITY AND THOSE OTHER THINGS GENERALLY ARE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND SO I JUST WANT TO MENTION WHAT A FEW OF THOSE ARE BUT OF COURSE THESE ARE THINGS THAT YOU WOULD ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO OBTAIN PRESCRIPTIONS FOR FROM YOUR M D AND YOUR MD WOULD WITHOUT QUESTION WOULD WANT TO TAKE BLOOD TEST PRIOR TO PRESCRIBING THESE THINGS SO FOR INSTANCE IF MEN HAVE BEEN TAKING EXOGENOUS TESTOSTERONE THROUGH THE USE OF ANIBAL EX STEROIDS LIKE PERFORMANCE IN ANCING DRUGS OR EVEN TESTOSTERON REPLACEMENT THER BE THEIR INDOGENOUS TESTOSTERON LEVELS ARE GOING TO BE VERY LOW AND THEIR SPERM COUNTS ARE GOING TO BE VERY LOW UNLESS FOR INSTANCE THEY ARE PRESCRIBED IN TAKING SOMETHING LIKE H C G HUMAN CORIANI GENATATROPEN WHICH MIMICS ELATION WOULD STIMULATE THE TESTIES TO PRODUCE TESTOSTERON AND THROUGH SOME INDIRECT PATHWAYS A RESCU SPERMATOGENISIS ALTHOUGH NOT TO THE SAME DEGREE AS IF PEOPLE ARE NOT TAKING EXOCENOS SOURCES OF TESTOSTERONE SOME MEN EVEN IF THEY'VE NEVER TOUCHED T RT OR EXOGEOUS TESTOSTERONE OF ANY KIND WILL BE PRESCRIBED TO TAKE H C G BECAUSE OF ITS ABILITY TO STIMULATE THE TESTIES PRODUCE MORE TESTOSTERONE AND SPERMS THET IS TAKING H C G ALONE OTHER MEN WILL TAKE OR WILL BE PRESCRIBED RATHER EFFESAH IN ORDER TO STIMULATE PERMATAGENSIS OR H C G AND EFFESAGE OR CLOMAPHIN WHICH CAN REGULATE ALL SORTS OF THINGS IN THE BOTH TESTOSTERON AND ESTERGEN RELATED PATHWAYS OF THE LEVEL OF BRAIN AND PETUITARY AND GONAD TESTIES LIKEWISE FOR WOMEN IF THEIR LOW INEFFISAGE THAT MIGHT BE PRESCRIBED EFISAGE IF THERE ARE IM LOW IN LUTINIZING HORMONE THEY MIGHT BE PRESCRIBED H C G IF THER LOINTISTOSTERONE THEY MIGHT EVEN BE PRESCRIBED TO STOSTERON AND IF THEIR TESTOSERONIS TOO HIGH AND THEIR DEALING WITH PICIOES THEY MIGHT BE PRESCRIBED ANTIANDRGENS AND ANDRGEN BLOCKERS AND ON AND ON AND ON THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT HORMONES THAT CAN IMPACT THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE OPULATORY IN THIS PRMATAGENISICYCLE THAT THE OBE G WY ENDS AND TE EUROLOGISTS FOCUS ON MALE FERTILITY NOWDAYS REALLY HAVE AN EXCELLENT HANDLE ON WHICH LEVERS AND BUTTONS AND THREADS TO PULL IN PUSHION AND SO FORTH IN ORDER TO SET IN MOTION OF PROPER OPULATORY CYCLE AND A PROPER SPERMANAGENISICYCLE YUNOW EVERYTING WE TALKED ABOUT UP UNTIL NOW AND AN THE EARLY PASE OF THIS EPISODE ESPECIALLY ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN COMMANDS THE PETUITARY AND THE PETUITARY COMMENDS THE GONADS AND THEN THE GONADS E OVERY OR THE TESTIES SEND FEED BACK SIGNALS TO THE PETUITARY TO THEM INFLUENCE THE PETUITOR ALL OF THAT INCREDIBLE ORCHESTRA OF THAT DANCE IS SO TIGHTLY REGULATED IN A WAY THAT REALLY PROVIDES THE OB G W ENDS AND THE FERTI LITYDUCTS CONCERN WITH MALE FORTHILITY EXCEPTIONAL TOOLS TO FOR INSTANCE FIGURE OUT IF A MAN IS NOT PRODUCING ANY SPERM BUT HIS TUSTOSTERON LEVELS ARE WELL WITHIN NORMAL RANGE WELL THEN THEREARE SOME VERY CLEAR SETS OF EXPLORATIONS AND PETENTIAL TREATMENTS SOME OF WHICH ARE MECHANICAL MAKING SURE THE EPEDITIMUS AND VASDEFERENS ARE CLEAR ALLOWING THE SPERM DENTER THE EJACULANE THE EJACULATE ENTER THE ERETHRA AN THE OBVIOUSLY O TO ENTER THE FEMALE AS WELL AS FOR A WOMAN WHO'SE NOT OVULATING TO A JUST HER LEVELS OF EFFASAGE OR MAYBE EVEN TO APPLY ACCUPUNCTURIN CONJUNCTION WITH SUPPLEMENTATION END VARIOUS PRESCRIPTION HORMONTHERAPIES TO ADJUST FERTILITY AND OVULATION AND THE PROBABILITY OF SUCCESSFUL PREGNANCY SO THERE'S A VAST LANDSCAPE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND SURGICAL INTERVENTIONS OF VARYING DEGREES OF INVASIVENESS AND SOME ARE FOR INSTANCE OUTPATIOPRECEDURES SOME REQUIRE GENERAL ANTESIA ET CETERA IN ORDER TO MAXIMISE MALE AND FEMALE FERTILITY WHAT HAVE TRIED TO DO TODAY IS TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A DEEP DIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE OBULATORIAN MENSTRUAL CYCLE WE TALKT ABOUT THE BRAIN THE PETUITARY THE OVERY THE PILOPIANTUBES AND INFACT THE WHOLE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE AXIS AS IT RELATES TO FERTILITY AND REPRODUCTION ALSO DESCRIBE THE MALE REPRODUCTIVE AXIS AS IT RELATES TO THE BRAIN THE PETUITARY THE GONAD THE TESTEES AND THE VARIOUS DUCS THE PATHWAYS OUT OF THE TESTES THAT ALLOW THE SPERM TO BE ENRICHD WITHIN THE SEAMEN AND THAN THE SEMAN AND THE EJACULATETO EXIT THROUGH THE ERETHRA I DID ALL THAT AS A WAY TO FRAME THE VARIOUS TOOLS AND INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN REALLY ASSIST IN INCREASING FERTILITY EQUALITY AND SPERM QUALITY SO WHEN WE DISCUST MIGHT TO CONDRY IN THE CONTECTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF VENEG WER THE DEVELOPMENT OF SPERM IN ITS ABILITY TO SWIM QUICKLY FORWARD NOW IT SHOULD MAKE SENSE AS TO WHY GIVEN INTERVENTION WHETHER OR NOT ITS ELL CARNATINE OR WHETHER OR NOT ITS EXERCISE OR WHETHER NOTIS GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP AN LIMITING STRESS WHILE THAT SHOULD MATTER AND WHY IN FACT MECHANISTICALLY THOSE INTERVENTIONS CAN WORK BECAUSE INDEED THERE ARE MANY INTERVENTIONS THAT WE CAN ALL DO AND USE TO SUPPORT ARE FERTILITY AND AGAIN AS A MORE GENERAL THEME TO DAY I REALLY WANTED TO A TEACH YOU ABOUT THE HUMAN REPRODUCTIVE AXIS DO YOU FIND THE BIOLOGY OF THE OBULATORY AND MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND SPERMANAGENS IS TO BE ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING TO ME AND AGAIN IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHOIS INTERESTED IN CONCEIVING OR  ALREADY CONCEIVE CHILDREN AND EVEN IF YOU DON'T WANT MORE CHILDREN THIS IS REALLY THE ASPECT OF OUR BIOLOGY THAT ALLOWED US TO BE HERE IT'S THE ASECT OF OUR BIOLOGY THAT DETERMINED WHETHEROR NOT WE ARE MALE OR FEMALE IT'S THE ASPECT OF OUR BIOLOGY THAT DETERMINES SO SO MUCH AND YET I THINK THAT MOST OF US GENERALLY ARE NOT TAUGHT THIS IN SCHOOL R AT LEAST NOT AT THE DEPTHAT WE DISCUSSED IT TO DAY SO HOPEFULLY THAT INFORMATION WAS IN AN OF ITSELF INTERESTING AND PERHAPS USEFUL AS WELL AND I DO THINK THAT EVEN IF PEOPLE ARE NOT WISHING TO CONCEIVE MORE CHILDREN THAT THE INFORMATION RELATED TO FERTILITY AND OP IMIZING EGG AND SPIRM HEALTH IS OF VALUE IN THE SENSE THAT OPTIMIZING EGG AND SPIRM HEALTH CAN BE USED AS A PROXY FOR OPTIMIZING OUR BODY AND BRAIN HEALTH GENERALLY IN OTHER WORDS AND HERE IM ADMITTEDLY TAKING A WORDS OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF THE VARIOUS WONDERFUL DOCTORS THET OBEGI WYANS IN UROLOGISTS THAT HELPED A INFORMI IN INTISPATION OF THIS EPISODE WHAT IS GOOD FOR THE WOMAN IS GOOD FOR THE EGG AND FOR FERTILITY AND  PREGNANCY AND WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE MAN IS GOOD FOR THE QUALITY AND PRODUCTION OF SPIRM AND FOR FERTILITY AND PREGNANCY PUT DIFFERENTLY WHETHER NOT WE ARE MALE OR FEMALE THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO OPTIMIZE OURE FERTILITY ARE THE EXACT SAME THINGS THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE DOING TO OPTIMIZE OUR VITALITY AND OUR LUNGEVITY NI REALIZE TODAY'S EPISODE WAS SO MUCH THE DEEP DIVE AND A FAIRLY BROAD AS WELL THAT IT ENDED UP BEING FAIRLY LONG AND EXTENSIVE AND YET WE STILL HAVE NOT TOUCHED ON ANY OF THE IMPORTANT THEMES THAT I KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT SO FOR INSTANTS MENOPAUS ANDRUPAUS P C O S AND OTHER THEMES RELATED TO HORMONES AND REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION AND BIOLOGY AND I PROMISE THAT WE WILL HAVE EPISODES BOTH SOLO EPISODES AND EPISODES WITH EXPERT GUESTS IN THE FUTURE TO COVER ALL OF THOSE TOPICS IN DETAIL MEANWHILE THE INFORMATION DISCUSSED IN TO DAY'S EPISODE SHOULD SERVE AS A BASIC FOUNDATION FOR THOSE DISCUSSIONS GOING FORWARD AND HOPEFULLY WERE OF INTEREST TO YOU IN THEIR

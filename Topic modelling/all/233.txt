ON AMERICANSLOMIC RELATIONS CARE ALONG WITH THE ASL U IS SUING THE FPIA OVER OPERATION FLAKS THE GOVERNMENT IS ARGUING IN RESPONSE THAT ALLOWING THE CASE TO GO FORWARD WOULD REVEAL STATE SECRETS AND HARM NATIONAL SECURITY KRAGG IS CARES PRIMARY RESOURCE IN THE CASE HE'S NOW HELPING THE PEOPLE HE USED TO SPY ON AND HE'S BEEN APOLOGIZING TO SOME OF THEM TOO HE SEES THEM OFTEN BECAUSE HE STILL LIVES AROUND THE CORNER FROM THE ERVINE MOSQU AND WORKS OUT IN THE SAME GIM HE MADE A SPECIAL POINT OF CALLING YASERA DELLREHIM WHEN THE FIRST PEOPLE HE GOT CLOSE TO AH I I I DETLLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THEY CALLED RIT AN THAT HE APOLOGIZE FOR IT BUT THE DAMAGE HIS DONE I OW I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I REAWE DON'T I NOW HAVE A FEAR THAT I BE MONTERED ALL THE TIME I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN CHANGE THAT CRAG'S

MITRE FELL MAKER O SIT HIS FONE KINGDOM OF SILENCE THAT MARTE SAWTY JOURNALIST JAMAN KACHOGY IS TRIMMING ON SHOWTIME BE XSAT EARLIER THIS TO PEIN COURT CASE THAT COME OUT OF THESE EVENTS WAS ARGUED LAST MONTH THE SENTULATION IN THE CASE AFPIIVERS IS PHYSAGA IS WHETHER THE EFPII WAS SPYING OE PEOPLE JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE MUSSLIN WHICH IF TRUE WOULD BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL BUT THE SPRAME QUIET WASN'T HEARING ARGUMENTS ON THAT QUESTION AT FRALL THIS TIME THE QUICTISM HASN'T GOTTEN TO THAT QUESTION CAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO GET THE CASE THROWN OUT  GOVERNMENT SAYS THE EPII HAD GOOD REASONS TO SUVAIL ALL THESE PEOPLE BUT AMOUNT OF PROPER DEFENSE AND EX LAIN WHAT THOSE REASONS ARE THEY WOULD HAVE TO REVEAL SECRET INFORMATION STATE SECRETS THEY WOULD COMPROMISE NATIONAL SECURITY AND THE SAYING THAT BECAUSE THEIR STATE SECRETS INVOLVED THE COURTS SHOULD THROW OUT THE CASE ENTIRELY THE LAWYERS ABRINGING THE SUIT ON BEHALF OF THE MUSCLE COMMUNITY AN ERVINE ARGUED BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT THE THIS GOS TOO FAR THEY ARE HAVE TO THROW OUT THE CASE THERE ARE WAYS THE CASE CAN STO MOVE FORWARD ONE OF THEM THERE'S A LAW THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT OR FISA THEY WOULD ALLOW A JUDGE TO LOOK AT THE CLASSIFIED MATERIALS THE TATES SECRED STILL WOULD NOT BE PUBLIC THE JUDGE COULD SEE THEM NOBODY ELSE COULD AND THEN THE JUDGE WOULD COME TO A DECISION IN THE CASE WORE THE LAWYERS SAY THE COURTS COULD JUST LET THE CASE PROCEED WITHOUT ANY SECRET EVIDENCE AT ALL JUST LEAVE THAT STUFF OUT O THE CASE THE BIGGER PRINCIPAL HERE IN THEIR VIEW IS TAT THERE SHOULD BE AWAY FOR PEOPLE TO GET THEIR DAY AND COURT EVEN IN A CASE WHERE THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS THERE ARE STATE SECRETS IF THE SPRING CORT DOES ALLOW THE CASE TO GO FORWARD THE LAWYER WHO ARGUED THE CASE FOR THE MUSLEN COMMUNITY ILEN A RELAN ON THEM SAID ULTIMATELY IF THEY WIN THEY WEN ALL THE INFORMATION GATHERED IN THE SURVEILLANCE OPERATION TO BE DESTROYED AND THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE PEOPLE IN THIS COMMUNITY THEY REALLY WERE UPSET THAT THE GOVERNMENT SPIED ON THEM WHILE THEY WERE JUST LIVING THEIR LIVES GOING TO MOSK IN THE MORNING THEY ARE HANGING OUT LIKE YOUR YESER AFTERY M PLAYING EXPOX SA UNO FIFA WITH HIS REMAINS AND IT'S REALLY DEEPLY OFFENSIVE TO PEOPLE THAT THE GOVERNMENT SPIE GOT ALL THAT INFORMATION AT SITTING SOMEWHERE IN SOME DITIOTA VAULT IN THE FPI AND THEY WANT ALL THAT

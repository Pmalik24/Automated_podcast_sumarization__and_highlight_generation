SO JOBIDONS H LEGAL IMMIGRATION CRISIS IS REAL AND IT IS REALLY RELLY GROWING TAKE A LOOK AT THIS GRAPHIC FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES WEBSITE IS FROM TO DAY TABOUT BORDER IN COUNTERS IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE THIS IS ABSOLUTLY STUNNING HOUR GO THROUGH IT IN DETAIL BECAUSE IT DEFINTELY SHOWS JUST HOW OPEN JOBIDON HAS LEFT THE BORDER WOON TWENTY TWENTY THREE AGAIND THIS ACCORDING TO OU S CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION THERE WERE THREE POINT ONE MILLION ATTEMPTED BORDER CROSSINGS AT TH U S SOUTHERN BORDER IN TWENTY TWENTY THREES THE QUESTION BECOMES ONE WHAT'S DRIVING THAT AND TWO HOW MANY OF THES PEOPLE GOT IN AND IT'S QUESTION TO THEN ANSERS QUESTION ONE IF LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE STRUNG UP THE BORDER AND LOTS WEOPL OAR GETTING IN THAT OF COURSE IS GOING TO DRIVE MORE PEOPLE TO THE BORDERS YET THREE POINT ONE IN PEOPLE SHOWING UP AGAIN AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER AND HERE'S HOW THIS BREAKSDOWN SIX  HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THOSE PEOPLE ENTERED UNDETECTED THAT IS AN ESTIMATE A BY C B P THOSE WOULD BE THE KNOWN GODAWAYS NOW THRE'S A WHOLE CATEGORY YERE THAT IS NOT EVEN ON THE CHART THOSE WO BE THE UNKNOWN GODAWAYS WHO WE ONREALLY HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW MANY UNKNOWN GODAWAYS THERE ARE THE WAY THE WE KNOW THE KNOWN GODAWAYS IS BECAUSE THERE IS CAMERA COVERAGE OF LARGE SUATHES OF THE AMERICAN BORDER BUT WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE BORE PATROL AGENTS WHERE SITTING ON EVERY SINGLE CAMERA ALL THE TIME THE WAY THAT IT WORKS THAT YOU HAVE THESE BORDER CAMERAS AN THERE LOADED ON TO ESSENTIALLY GIANT PYLONS AND THERE RE FOUR OF THEM POINTSED IN ALL DIRECTIONS BUT IF YOU HAVE ONE BORDER PATROL AGENT WHOSE IN CHARGE OF TWENTY CAMERAS THRE CON BE SOME PEOPLE HE DOESN'T SEE WHEN THEY RUSH INTWO THE COUNTRY GOES FOR BATHOM BREAK AND SUDDENLY THAT'S WHEN SOMMADY COMES THROUGH THAT ACCORDING TO PEOPLE I KNOW ATCUSTOMS AND BORDE PROTECTION WHAT YOU ARE REALLY LOOKING AT IS PROBABLY ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO HAVE ENTERED UNDETECTED MINNIMUMS YOU TOING ABOUT A MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE ENTERED ON DETECTIVES IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE ALONE KA NOW THAT STILL LEAVES TWOPOINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAD IN COUNTERS WITH YOU HASE CUSTOMS IN BORDE PROTECTION OUT THE WAY WE TEN TO THINK OF THAT AND THIS IS WHY A LOT OF THIS IS WEASEL WORDS WHEN YOU THINK EM IN COUNTERS BY U S CUSTOMS AND BORD PROTECTION WHAT YOU THINK OF IS A BORE PATROL AGENTS STUMBLES UPON LEGAL IMIGRANT AND TELLS THM TO GO HOME WRONG THAT NEVER HAPPENS ALMOST EVER A NOW USED TO HAPEN A LOT MORE UNDER TITLE FORTY TWO TITLE FORTY TWO WHAS A PROVISION OF FEDERAL LAW THAT SUGGESTED THAT IF YOU WERE FEARFUL THAT PEOPLE ARE ENTERING THE COUNTRY WITH DISEASE YOU COULD SIMPLY TURN THEM BACK AT THE BORDER AND THAT WAS USED FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN THE AFTEROMAT OF COVE NINETEN BUT IT DID END SO EVEN IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE EXPELLED UNDER TITLE FORTY TWO FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE THOSE EFFECTIVELY SPEAKING WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO WERE EXPELLED YET ABOUT A HUNDRED EGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ERE VOLUNTARY DEPARTURES AND A HUNDRED EIGHT FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE EXPEDITED REMOVALS THOSE WHO BE PEOPLE WHO HAD LIKE CRIMINAL BACKGROUNDS FOR EXAMPLE SO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT THREE PEN ONE MILLION WHO RECEIVED TH DEEPPORTATION ORR OR WHO WERE EXPELLED EIHT HUDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND BUT REMEMBER TITL FORTY TWO HAS NOW GONE AWAY THAT MEANS FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THIS YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IF THESE NUMBERS WORE TO REMAIN STEDY WOULD NOW ENTER THE UNITED STATES THAT MEAN THAT ASIDE FROM TITLE FORTY TWO WHICH AGAIN WAS ONLY IN A IT WAS ONLY IN APPLICATION TEMPORARILY UNDER TITLE FORTY TWO FIVE HUNDRED SIX FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE TURNED AWAY ALL THOSE PEOPLE WOULD NOW ENTER WHICH MEANS A GRAND TOTAL OF THREE HNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY REMOVED OR DEPARTED VOLUNTARILLY TBECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE THEY REALIZED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE DINGED ON A CRONAL BACKGROUND TRACT NOW WE GET TO THE PEOPLE WHO ERE ADDED TO THE DOCKET AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REST OF THEM SO OF THE PEOPLE WHOARE PROCESS UNDER TITALLY THOSE ONE POINT NINE MILLION PEOPLE ONLY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND OF THOSE PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY REMOVED EVERY OTHER PERSON ENTERED THE UNITED STATES ALL OF THEM THAT MEANS THAT YOURE TALKING ABOUT JUST FROM THIS CHART ALONE TWO POINT FOR MILLION PEOPLE IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHO ENTERED THE UNITED STATES THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE HERE ILLEGALLY THEY DO NOT HAVE ASYLUM PROTECTED STATUS REFUG STATUS THAT REFUG OR ASYLUM STATUS HAS TO BE PROVED IN A QUART OF LAW BUT THOSE PEOPLE HAVE NOT PROVE TO ANYTHING IN A QORT OF WAI TINSTEAD THEY'VE COME TO THE BORDER THEY CLAIM THAT THEY ARE IN FACT ASILEES FROM THEIR HOME COUNTRIES THAT THEY ARE OUR PEOPLE WHO CANNOT GO BACK BECAUSE IF THEY GO BACK THO WLL BE KILLED OR THEY'LL BE PERSECUTED OR WHATEVER AND THEN BECAUSE WE ARE NOT PROCESSING THEM AND BECAUSE ME DO PROCESS THAT OURE STANDARDS ARE TWO LOW WE'RE ALLOWING EVERYBODY INTO THE COUNTRY SO EVEN A COURTING TO THIS NEW YORK TIMES CHART YOU HAD A MINIMUM OF TWO POINT FOR MILLION PEOPLE WHO CROSSED THE  SOUTHERN BORDER IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE NOW UNDERSTAND BY WAY OF CONTRAST THAT DURING THE INTIRATY OF THE TRUMP AD MINISTRATION THE NUMBER OF BORDER IN COUNTERS DURING THE ENTIRITY OF THE TRUMP MINISTRATION WAS ONE POINT SEX MILLION YOU HAD TWO POINT FOR MILLION PEOPLE ENTER LASTURE ALONE UNDER JOBIDON THAT IS IT MEINSANE NUMBER AN NONE THSE PEOPLE GONE AWAY ONE PEOPLE ARE BROUGHT INTO THE UNITED STATES IN THERE GIVEN ADATE SHOP LATER TVAST MAJORITY OF THEM NEVER GAN A SHOW UP LATER BECAUSE WHY WOULD THY POSSIBLY SHOW UP THEY BEN INTEGRATED INTO AMERICAN SOCIETY THEY'RE RECEIVING WHATEVER BENEFITS THEY CAN RECEIVE THERE IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY REAL STATE BENEFITS MAY BE UP TO AN INCLUDING HELF CARE WHY EXACTLY THEY SHOW FOR COURT DATE WHERE THEY MADE VERY WELL BE DEPORTED IF THEY CAN'T PROVE THAT THEY HAVE A REAL ASYLUM CLAIM SO INSTEAD THEY JUST STAY THAT IS WHAT JOBITON HAS DONE AND HE HAS DONE THAT BECAUSE THERE WERE EXECUTIVE ORDERS IN PLACE UNDER DONAL TRUMP THAT PREVENTED A LOT OF THIS NOT ONLY TITLE FORTY TWO BUT MOST PROMINENTLY REMIN IN MEXICO REMAIN IN MEICO SAID THAT IF YOU SHOWED UP THE BORDER AND YOU SAID I FEAR TO GO BACK TO MY HOME COUNTRY THE TRUMP AD MINISTRATIONS HAT OKIE WAIT MEXICO WILL FIGUR IT OUT IF THE PROCESSU BOUNEATOWAIT IN MEXICO WHICH MEANS YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE RELEASTIN TO THE INTERIOR BECAUSE THERE'S GOOD SHOT THE YOU ACTUALLY WOULD HAVE TO SHOW UP FOR YOUR QUAURT CASES AND THEN YOU WOULD BE REJECTED AND IN THE MEANTIME HEU CANTUES DISAPPEAR IN CHICAGO OR NEW YORK OR LANTO OR DENVER OR WHATEVER BUT TOBIDENT GOT RID OF THAT LIKE THEY ONE THAT WAS ON OF THE VERY FIRST THINGS THAT HE DID WAS GET RID OF REMAIN IN MEXICO THAT IS THE REASON YOU ARE SEEING THIS VAST EXTRAORDINARY INCREAS AND YOU LEGAL IMIGRATION AFTUUS SOUTHERN BORDER IT'S AMAZING SO THE INPACT OF ALL OF THIS IS

TRYING TO GO TO A BETTER PLACE YOU ALSOID WANT TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES BUT IT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY OF TE AMERICAN GOVERNMENS TO PRATACK AMERICA'S BORDR RS A COUNTRY WITHOUT BORDERS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT A COUNTRY WHAT'S IN CREDIBLE TO ME IS HOW THE LEFT HAS COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN ABOUT THIS IT'S TOTALLY INSANE IN TWO THOUSAN FIFTEEN HERE IS BURNY STANDERS MAKING THE CASE THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE OPEN BORDERS HOPING WATERS ORNIT  TA WANTS US THAT'S THE CULP OF THIS PROPOSAL THE INLE CORSE I ME THAT'S THE RITE WING PROPOSAL WHICH SAYS TE CENTURALLY THERE ISNON YAN I IT'S LEP BUT IF  ANYBODY THE WOULDN MAKE YO LO O BO A POR RITER WOULDNT IT  DIN BAKE EVERYBODY IN AMERICA PORTING  DOING AWAY WITH WITH THE CONSLEP OF AN ATION TITE N I DON'T THING IS ANY COUNTRY ON THE WORL WHICH BELIEVES IN THAT NO ONE BELIEVES THAT EXCEPT FOR APPARENTLY LARGE SLAWS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SO HOW'S BORDER PATRAL ANTASTO BORER PATROL HAS BEEN TOLD THEIR FIRST PRIORITY IS THAT ONE SOME ONE CLAIMS ASYLUM YOU MUS AS A BORDER PATROL AGENT MAKE DIRECT FOR THEM LIKE BEELINE DIRECTLY FOR THEM NOW RECENTLY WENT DOWN TO THE BORDER WER CAN AVE A TON OF MATERIAL ON THIS THAT IS COMING OUT EN LET ME TELL YOU THE SITUATIONOF THE BORDER IS A FULL SCALE DISASTER AREA BORDER PATROL AGENTS ARE BEING TOLD NOT TO ACTUALLY POLICE THE BORDER THEY ARE SSENTIALLY ACTING AS A FAIRY SERVICE FOUR ELEGAL EMIGRANS WHICH IS WHY YOU NOW HAVE THE AMAZING SPECTACLE OF YOU LEGAL OMIGRAN'S CROSSING THE BORDER AND THEN  SITTING AROUND AND COMPLAINING HAT THE BORDER PATROL ISN'T SHOWING UP FAST ENOUGH LIKE YOU WOULD COMPLAIN

THREE DAYS NOW THREE MAKESHIFT BORDER CAMPS WE STOP AT IN EASTERN SANDIAGO COUNTY ALONGSIDE MICENS FROM LATIN AMERICA AT EACH CAMP WE DOESNS FROM CHINA I'VE A QUESTION WHY WOULD YOU POSSIBLY LEGALLY IMIGRATUA COUNTRY AND BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BORDER PATROL TO HOWSAND WORM YOU WHY IN THE ANSER OBVIOUSLYS BECAUSE THE BY DMINISTRATION IS MADE CLEAR THAT THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO AND BY THE WAY THESE ILLEGAL IN RENS ARE NOT WRONG THEBIDIN ADMINISTRATION HAS IN FACT MADE CLEAR TO BORDER PATROL AGENTS THAT THEIR CHIEF FUNCTION NOW NINETY PER ENT OF BORDER PATROL AGENTS HAVE BEEN STAFFE ON ESSENTIALLY BUSSING AND ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES AT THE BORDER THERE'S AN ACTUAL SIGN IN CERTAIN PARTS OFTHE BORDER WHERE YOU PUSH A BUTTON FOR BORDER PATROL HELP I'M NOT GETTING THAT'S A REAL THIING AGAIN WE N HAVE A TUNA MATERIAL IT'S COMING OUT ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT REALLY IS STUNNING WHAT'S HAPPENING AT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER BUT THE FACT THAT JO BIDON HAS OPEN THEBORDER WHITE IS CLEAR TO LITERALLY EVERY ONE NOW WHAT'S AMAZING IS THAT DEMOCRAT'S CONTINUE TO CLAIM THAT THAT JOBIDONEIS ON TOP OF THIS THING JOBININ ON TOP OF ANYTHING JOBDIN CAN BARELY GET INTO A WALK IN SHOWER AT THIS POINT HERE'S SENATOR CRISCOONS TRYING TO PRETEND THAT IT'S THE UN PRECEDENTED BORDER CRISIS THET'S MOTIVATING BIDIN TO ADREST THE BORDER CRISIS THAT OF COURSE DUNTRUE IF JOBIDN ONE INTENTER AND THE BORDER CRISIS TOMORROW HE CAN PROBABLY DO WIT TH COUPLE OF HIS DECULE BORDERS HE'S NOT DOING ANY OF THAT THERE HAS TO BE TROMATIC ACTION IN STOPPING THE FLOW OF ILLEGAL EM IGRAD INTOF THIS COUNTRY YES AND JOE A THAT VOEW BROAGLY IS SHARED THAT WEMEAD AND EMIGRATION SYSTEM A THAT IS SAFE THAT IS SUMAN AND THAT IS LEGAL AND THE NUMBERS OF FOLKS WHO ARE PRESENTING AT THE SOUTHERN BORDERS SEEKING ASYLUM HAS MOTIVATED OUR PRESIDENT A BOTH IN HIS FIRST STATE OF THE UNION A TO CALL ON CONGRESS TO LEGISLATIVELY ADDRESS THIS AND GIVIN THE POWERS HE NEEDS AND IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL PACKAGE HE HAS FOR MONTHS AGO T AS FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO STRENGTHEN BOARDERS SECURITY WE DISAGREED BUT TWEEN REPOPLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ABOUT WHAT COLICIES WE'LL MOST LIKELY ACHEEVED THAT OUTCOME BUT THERE IS A BROAD AWARENESS THAT THE HUGE NUMBERS OF FOLKS WHO ARE TRANSITING CENTRAL AMERICA AND COMING THROUGH MEXICO TO OUR SOUTHERN BORDERS JUST NOT SUSTAINABLE GAT THEN WHY DON'T YOU STOP IT AND THE ANSWER IS WHAT DEMOCRATS WANT IS THEY WANT MORE MONEY FOR AD MINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS SO S JUST TOLD YOU BORDER PATRAL NINETY PER CENT STAFFED ON ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS THEY WANT MORE MONEY FOR AD MINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO BROD IN THE ABILITY OBY LEGAL IMIGRANS TO ENTER THE COUNTRY THEY DO NOT WANT THE BORDER POLICE TO BETTER AND AGAIN THE DRUG CRAT TELLS CONTROL THE

AS I SAY EVEN SOME MEMBERS THE ABOMINADMINISTRATION LIKE THIS IS CRAZY J JOHNSON WHO IS THE FORMER D  CHASECRETARY UNDER BRAGUAMA HE HAS SAID THIS IS CRAZY STEVEN RATTINER WHO SERVED AS COUNCILLOR TO THE TREASURY SECRETARY UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HE HAS A PECE OVER THE NEAR TIMES TO DAY TALKING ABOUT THE SITUATION AT OUR SOUTHERN BOARDER HE SAYS DEMOCRATS WANT MORE MONEY TO PROCESS THE BAKUA REPUBLICANS WANT SUBSTANTIALLY NARROW THE GROUNDS HOW MUCH MIGRANS WOULD BE PERMITTED TO REMAIN IN THE UNITED STATES WE NEED LOTS OF THE FORMER AND A BIT OF THE LADTER AH NO ACTUAL WEU NEED A LOT OF THE LADDER AND NOT NEARLY AS MUCH OF THE FORMER HE SUGGESTS THAT THE DEMOCRATS PUSH FOM OURE FUNDING IS CORRECT THE COUNTRY'S IMMEDIATE NEED IS TO UN CLOG THE EMIGRATION COURT SYSTEM KNOW THAT IS NOT THE IMMEDIATE NEED THE IMMEDIATE NEED IS TO CLOSE THE BORDER AND THEN FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HELL TO DO WITH THE PEOPLE HERE THE PROBEM IS TE UNCLAG THE COURT SYSTEM THAT IS GOING TO FACILITATE MORE ILLEGAL ENTRY IF YOU UNCLOG THE SYSTEM ALL THAT MEANS IS PROSTING MORE PEOPLE AT THE BORDER NOW HE SAYING THAT MEANS THAT O'LL GET TO MORE COURT CASES FASTER YAT BUT ICE ISN'T TE PORTING ANYBODY SO PEOVLE ON SHOW UP FOR THE COURT CASES ICE IS NOT GOING TO GO INTO THEIR HOUSES AND THEN PICK THEM UP AND THROW THEM OUT THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THA YOBINAN HAS TAST ICE WITH DOING SO SAYING THA WE NEED MORE ADMINISTRATE OF LAW JUDGES WHE'RE GOING TO ADJUDICATE WHETHER SOME ONE HAS A TRUE ASYLUM CLAIM OR NOT UNLESS THEYARE GOING TO DO THAT WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS IT AIN'T GON A HAPPEN AN NEED E LAY WHERE PEOPLE ARE RELEASED INTO TE COUNTRY IS GOING TO RESULT AND THOSE PEOPLE REMAINING IN THE COUNTRY HE SAYS WE MUST REDUCE THE FLOAT TO THE BORDER WHICH WILL REQUIRE MAKING EMIGRATING INTO THE US BY SUCH MEANS MORE DIFFICULT EVEN RATTINER SAS AS RE PUBLICANS HAVE LONG DEMANDED AND DEMOCRATES ARE COMING TO SEE AS NECESSARY OUR OBLIGATION UNDER INTERNATIONAL LOT TO PROVIDE ASYLUM NEED NOT CREATE CHAOS FOR STARTERS WE SHULD REQUIRE ASYLUM SECRES TAL PLAY IN MEXICO OR OTHER COUNTRYES RIT IS THE REMAIN A MEXICAL POLICY THAT TRUMP AT TEMPTED TO DO AND THEN BIDIN BASICALLY KILLED ALSO SAYS RATENER WE NED TO TIGHTEN HE ASYLUM CRITERIA FOR EXAMPLE WE SHULD MAKE A GREATER DISTINCTION IN THE ASYLUM PROCESS BETWEEN THOSE WHO FOLLOWED O STABLISHED PROCEDURES AND ENTER THE COUNTRY THROUG N ESTABLISH POURT OFVENTRY AND THOSE WHO CROSSED ALONG OUR BORDER BUT TREE BETWEEN PORTS FVENTRY WHEILE NO ACTUALY WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS TIGHTEN UP WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A PURSIN WHO SHOULD RECEIVE ASYLUM WHICH RATTENER ADMITS E SAYS WHILE RECOGNIZING THE NEED FOR DUE PROCESS WE SHOULD RAISE THE LEGAL STANDARD FOR CONSIDERATION FOR ASYLUM FROM A SIGNIFICANT POSSIBILITY THAT ASYLUM WOULD BE GRANTED TO SOMETHING CLOSER TO THE STANDARD USED FOR FINAL DECISIONS IN EMIGRATION COURT WE ALSO WEU NEED TO FURTHER LIMIT USE OF HUMANITARIAN PAROLL A PROM THEM EXPANDED BY THE BI DMINISTRATION THAT ALLOWS MORE MIGRANTS FROM PLACELIYKE VEN IS UAYLA AN NICADAGUA TO TEMPORARILY ENTER THE COUNTRY AND APPLY FOR RELIEF AS HEARTBREAKING IS MAYBE WE SIMPLY CANNOT TAKE EVERY REFUGY FROM EVERY FAILED STATE CAYE ALL OF THAT IS TRUE AND YOU KNOW WHERE ALL F THAT STUFFIS THAT S ALLAN ATRURTO THAT'S EXACTLY THE BILL L THE DEMOCRATS ARE CURRENTLY REJECTING ALL OF ITS AN NAH AR TWO DEMOCRATS ARE CUNENTLY REJECTING IT WHICH MEANS THIS IS AN IDEALOGICAL THING AN JOBIDON COULD SIMPLY REE IN STATE THE POLICIES THAT DONAL TRUMP HAD IN PLACE AND THE BORDER FLOW WOULD STOP IT WOULD STOP WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING REMOTELY LIKE THIS FLOW AT THE BORDER UNDER  DONALTRUM IT DIDN'T EXIST IN ANYTHING REMOTELY LIKE THESE NUMBERS THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON FOR THAT THE ONLY REASON FOR THAT IS NOW CLIMA

SURGERIES LIK AN NOTESJOB IT JUST MEANS THE CAN ELECT THE TIME TO DO IT IS NOT LIKE AN EMERGENCY SURGER BUT IT SEEMS LIKE IF THE SECRETARY DEFENC AS A SURGERY FOR PROSTAY CANSERS RYTLLAT SOMEBODY KNOW HERE'S THE PENSAGON PROSECRETARY ANNOUNCING THIS THIS IS A STATEMENT FROM DOCTOR JOHN MATICS TROMA MEDICAL DIRECTOR AND DOCTOR GREGORY CHESTNUT TO CENTER FOR PROSTATE DISEASE RECEARCH OF THE MIRTH THE

CANIC COMMAND BUT THE TRANSPARENCIS WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT IT WELL THEN WHY ARE THERE NO CONSEQUENCES OR ASAULTS MEAN THE FACT THAT AUSTIN IS STILL WORKING THERE IS PRETTY INSANE IT'S PRETTY GRAZY AND

THE WORLD WILL BE A SOLID PLACE WE'LL GO BACK TO NORMAL RY NORMALILL BE THE NEW NORMAL AND INSTEAD WHAT WE GET IS THE WORLD ON FIRE AND ECONOMY IN THE MIDST OF STAGNATION THE GREATESTILY LIMEGRATION  CRISIS OF OUR LIFETIMES AND A PRESIDENT WHOSE WANDERING AROUND INTO ALL'S OCCASIONAL WAK WE GHET THAT'S WHAT WE GOT THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE WORLD'S MOST AMAZING PITCH MEANWHILE THINGS CONTINUE TO HEAT UP IN THE MIDLESOM GAN WHEN THE REASONS THINGS HEAT UP IN THE MDDLELEAST IS BECAUSE OF A PERCEPTION OF WEAKNESS THE MIDDLEAST RUNS ON PERCEPTION OF STRENGTH IT IS HOW THE MT E LEAST RUNS IT HAS

TO DAY SO ON THE ONE HAND YOU HVE TENTY BLINKONSAING THE CORRECT THING THAT COMMASS COULD AVE ENDED THIS OCTOBER EIGHTH SIMPLY BY SURRENDERING AND GIVING UP THE HOSSAGES AND THEY DIDN'T HEAR AS BLINKIN SAYING THE RIGHT THING AN THEN WE'LL SEE BLINKINS AN MANY OF THE WRONG THINGS ITHINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT EVERYONE HAS COICEIS TO MAKE AND THAT INCLUDS SOM OSS HAMOS COULD HAVE ENDED THIS  OCTOBER EIGHTH BY NOT HIDING BEHIND CIVILIANS BY PUTTING DOWN ITS WEAPONS BY SURRENDERING BY RELEASING THE HOSSAGES NONE OF THE SUFFERING NONE OF THE SUFFERING WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IS HAMAS HAVENT DONE DIDN DID WHAT IT DID ON OCTOBER SEVENTH AND HAD IT MADE DIFFERENT DECISIONS THEREAFTER CASE O THAT HAPPENS TO BE CORRECT BUT THEN ON THE OTHER HAND IS LIKE TRYING TO HOLD ISRAEL'S ARMS BEHIND IT'S BACK HE SUGGESTED YESTERDAY THAT THE BIG PROMISE THAT ISRAEL IS SOME HALITAKING STEPS UNDER CUTTING PALSTININS ABILITY TO GOVERN THEMSELVES EFFECTIVELY OM I HAVE A QUESTION WHEN HAVE PALISTINIANS EVER GOVERN THEMSELVES EFFECTIVELY NAME A TIME LIKE ANY TIME BULER BULER THIS CHRISIS IS CLARIFIED YYOU CAN'T HAVE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER AND YOU CANT HEVE EITHER GO WITHOUT AN INTEGRATED REGIONAL APPROACH TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE ISRAEL MUST BE A ARDNER TO PALISTINING LEADERS WO'RE WILLING TO LEAVE THEIR PEOPLE IN LIVING SIDE BY SIDE IN PIECE WIT ISRAEL AND AS NEIGHBORS AND ISRAEL MUST BE AT MUST TOT TAKING STATS TUNDER CUT PALISTINGS ABILITY TO GOVERN THEMSELVES EFFECTIVELY EXCAN A SETTLY VIOLENCE CARRIED OUT WITH INPUNITY SETTLEMENT EXPANSION DEMOLITIONS OF VICTIONS ALL MAKE IT HARDER NOT EASIER ISRAEL GOD CHEEV LASTING PECE INSECURITY HATE IS ABSOLUTE STUPIDITY IS A STUPIDITY HAND WHAT HE'S SAYING AT THE BEGINNG OF THAT QUELLERHY SAYS THE GOALS ARE TAINABLE TOGETHER WHAT ARE THE GOALS ONE WOULD BE PEACE WITH THE PALSTONIANS IN THE OTHER OF BE PECE OF THE SURROUNDING ARAB STATES TIS GOING BACK TO THE OLD JOHN CARRY LINE THAT THE ONLY WAY TO ACHIEVE PIE IN THE REGION IS TO MAKE CONCESSIONS TO TERRIS GROUPS WHICH OF COURSE IS A LIE AND THE OPPOSITE OF THE TRUTH ISRAEL WAS ABLE TO ENGAGE IN THE ABRAHAM L CORDS UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TBECAUSE THE TRUMPED MINISTRATION MADE CLEAR THAT ECONOMIC TIZES WITH ISRAEL IN NO WAY DEPENDED ON ISRAEL MAKING CONCESSIONS TO SAY THE PALISTONIAN AUTHORITY WHEN HES SUGGESTS TO WHAT'S UNDER CUTTING PALISTONIAN SELF GOVERNMENTS IS FOR EXAMPLE SETTLEMENT EXPANSION WHY WHY I'VE A QUESTION WHY'S BUILDING AN EXTRA BEDROOMENT OF OUT WHAT IS THAT OF ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN IN ELECTION INSIDE PALISTONIAN GOVERNED AREAS FOR NEARLY TWO DECATES EXPLAIN SURE SELLON HERE WHY I WANT HER WHY IT IS THAT ISRAEL ALLOWING FOR EXAMPLE THE EXPANSION OF NEVADE DANIEL IS SOMEHOW IMPACTING THE FACT THAT THE PALISTONIANS REFUSE TO ELECT  GOVERNMENTS THAT ACTUALLY PICK UP THE TRASH PLEASE EXPLAIN PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW ISRAEL COMPLETELY ABANDONING THE GOSSIS TRIP RE MOVING EIGHT THOUSAND JEWS FROM THE GOSSAISTRIP NO SETTLEMENT THAT TOTY NOTHING HAPPENING THERE COMPLETE SELF GOVERNENTS BY COMMASS WHY EXACTLY DID THAT NOT RESULT IN SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL WAS THAT ALSO BECAUSE O ISRAEL LICE THIS IS ALLSO STUPID BUT AGAIN THE REASON THAT HE'S SENDING THESE MIX SIGNALS IS IN THE HOPES THAT SOMEHOW THAT IS GOING TO BUY THE LOVE OF THE EGYPTIANS OR THE SALTIES HE'S COMPLETELY MISREADING THE ROOM THE EGYPTIANS AND THE SOUTIES DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE PALISTONIANS ARE CAPABLE OF MODERATION OR SELF GOVERNMENTS YOU KNOW WHY THEY BELIEVE THAT YOU KOW I KNOW THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY WON'T TAKN ANY PALISTONIAN REFUGES NONE AND ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS HERE THAT THE UNITED STATES KEEPS RASING HIS NOW THEIR MEMBERS OF THE ISRAELY GOVERNMENT WAS SAID THAT THEY WANT PALISTONIANS TO LEAVE GOSSAP TAY FORGET ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND BECAUSE NITTIN OW WHO SAYS HE'S NOT CON TO DO THAT LET'S TALK INSTEAD ABOUT THE FACT THAT IF YOU WERE LIVING IN GOSA MIGHT YOU WANT TO LEAVE IT MIGHT YOU WAN'T TO  NOT A GRI PLACE TO LIVE HAVENE'N A GRIPLACE LIF FOR VERY LONG TIME NOT LOT OF PEOPLE MOVING TO GOSA NOT TONES OF PEOPLE WERE LIKE YOU KNOW OR I'VE EVEN BEFORE ALL OF THIS WHERE LIKE YOU KNOWHRE I'D LOVE TO LIVE UNDER THE AUSPICIES OF COMAS IN GOZA SO WHAT IF PEOPLE WANT TO LEAVE WELL EGYPT WON'T TAKE THEM SOUTY WON'T TAKE THEM JORDAN WON'T TAKE THEM  NO ONE WILL TAKE THEM WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS WHY DO YO THING THAT IS COULD IT BE BECAUSE HISTORICALLY SPEAKIM PALISTNIAN POPULATIONS HAVEBEEN A DSTABILIZING FORCE IN EVERY REGION WHERE THEY HAVE ENTERED AND COULD THAT BE BECAUSE THEY ARE EXTREMELY POLARIZED COULD IT BE BECAUSE THE PALISTONIAN POPULATION ITSELF IS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY RADICAL ND THAT ISN'T MEAN THAT IFR IS A TERRIST DOESN'T MEAN PEOPLES ARE TO BE KILLED WHAT IT DOES MEAN IS THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO ASCESS IS SECURITY SITUATION THE MDAELEAST WITH OUT THAT FACTOR YOUARE COMPLETELY MISSING THE DECIDING FACTOR ON THIS ISSUE YOUARE SAYING THAT ISRAEL CAN ONLY MAKE SOME SORT OF PEACE WITH TALTY ARABIA FOR EXAMPLE BY SOMEHOW MAKING CONCESSIONS TWO GOVERNMENTS THAT DICK TO TORALLY RULE RADICAL POPULATIONS I IDNN'T UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC THERE DOESN'T MAE ANY SENSE AT ALL BUT T'S THOSE MAKE SIGNALS THAT ARE BEING RED IN THE REGION AND ARON IS READING THAT WHICH IS WHYRON CONTINUES TO PUSH A RON ISN ISN'T RATIONING THINGS DOWN A RON IS RATHETNG THINGS UP WHY IS A RON ISCAN CONTINUE TO POKE AN CONTINUE TO PROD UNTIL THERE SLAPPED ACROSS THE HEAD BY SOMEBODY T WOEN REQUIRE THE UNITED STATES TO QUON'T PUT INVADE ERON WEN REQUIRE A FULL SKILL WORTHRON AND WOULD REQUIRE FOR EXAMPLE KILLING AMUNCHTER WHOTHIES ALONG THE COASTING YAMMON TO STOP THEM FROM HOLDING UP GLOBAL SHIPPING BHICH IS SOMETHING THE UNITED STATES ECTUALY DOES HAVE A PRITTY STRONG DIRECT INTEREST IN BUT T ABY HE MISTRISH REFUSES TO DO ANY OF THAT AND MEANWHILE THE QUESTION BECOMES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLE CANS ONAL TRUM TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL OF THIS CAS OR IS HE GEN CREATE A GREASE FIRE HERE ON THE STOVE OF HIS OWN WELL GET'S THAT IN A SECOND FIRST YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT WE AT THE DAILYWARE WE LIKE BIOLOGY BECAUSE BIOLOGY SAYS THEY'RE ONLY TWO SEXES WERE NOT AFRAID TO SAY IT BUT SOME OF OUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS POINTS OUT A FLAW IN OUR JERMYS SHOP WE ONLY GETTER TO ONE OF THE SEXES O JERMY'S RAZORS IS ALL ABOUT EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO SHOP THE WOKE FREE ECONOMY AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE JERMY'S RAZORS FOR THE LADIES BECAUSE WOMEN DESERVE THE SAME QUALITY WOKE FREE BLADES AS MEN TWO SEXES TWO RAZORS IS REALLY IS THAT SIMPLE WHEN GOD MAKES A NEW SEC JERMIES WILL MAKE A NEW RAZOR PLUS WE'VE A LINE OF PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS OR A BETTER HAVES INCLUDING MOISTERIZING SHAVE CREEM LOTION BODYWASH AND DEODERANT LADIES HATDN OVER T JERMY'S RAZORS TOUGHT TOM GET YOUR RAZOR AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS TO DAY O CAM MEANWHILE NOW GAIN YOU WOUD IMAGIN THAT ALL OF THIS WOULD PROVIDE FODER FRADONALD TRUMP RUN NOW LET'S BE CLEAR DON TRU IS'T GET THE NOMINATE THERE ARE SOME POLES OUT OF FOR EXAMPLE NEW HAMPSHIRE THAT ARE SHWING NICKEY HALY IN PRETTY SOLID POSITION IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TO POSSIBLY WIN THAT STATE OF CHRIS CHRISTY IT IT'S HILARIUSOM IN THAT CRIS CHRISTY CONTINUES TO PRETEND THAT HE'S A PERSON IN THIS RACE AND YOU ON TALK ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO HAS AN EGO PROBLEM I'M NOT SURE THERE'S EVER BEEN A POLITICION LIKE CRIS CHRISTY WHO LITERALLY JUST STAYS IN RACES TO ALOW THE PERSON HE CLAIMS TO BE THE GREATEST THREATS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO WIN BU CHRIS CHRISTY BEING IN THE RACIN NEW HAMPSHIRE IS SO UNBELIEVABLY INSANE I CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN HOW DOM THAT IS MEAN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE RIGHT NOW THE LATEST PULLING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE FROM SEE AN END AND UNIVERSTY NEW HAMPSHIRE SHOWS TRUMP UP THIRTY UNINE THIRTY TWO ON HAILEY THAT'S SPITTING DISTANCE AND CHRIS CHRISTY IS PULLING TWELVE PER CENT WHY IS CHRIS CHRISTY IN THIS RACE I LOVE THAT HE'S BASICALLAK SCRITMAN I'M STAYING IN NO MATTER WHAT FOR NO REASON JUST TO BE A JACKASS THE OT A RESPECT THAT YOT AR IT YOUT A RESPECT THE PLAY  MEANWHILE IN IA BY EVERY AVAILABLE POLE DONAL TRUMP IS WAY OUT AHEAD OF THE FIELD ACCORDING TO MOST POLES BASICALLY HALY ANTO SANTIS ARE RUNNING NECK AND NECK IN IWAN NOW AGAIN IWA IS NOT A DIRECT PULLING STATE I WAS A CAUCAS STATE SO THE FACT THAT TIS HAMPS HAS DONE A LOT OF HEAVY ON THE GROUN LIFTING IN IWA I THINK THAT MEANS HE OUT PERFORMS HIS PULL NUMBERS IN IWA BUT RIGHT NOW OBVIOUSLY TRUMP IS UP WAY AHEAD OF THE REST OF THE FIELD WHEN IT COMES TO SOUTH CAROLINA I'M ALWAYS SURPRISE THAT THEY DON'T DO MORE PULLING OF OF SOUTH CAROLINA IS HOIS KOND OF SHOCKING TO ME BUT THERE HAS NOT ACTUALLY BEEN A LOT OF PULLING OF SOUTH CAROLINA IN THE JEOPENOMINATION PROCESS THE PULLING TAT THERE HAS BEEN AT THIS POINT SHOWS TRUMP WELL AHEAD OF THE FIELD THE LATEST PULL AVERAGE TRUM FIVE THIRTYEIGHT PASS TRUMP UP AT FIFTY TWO POINT NINE PER SENT HELEE AT TWENTY FOUR ANTO STANCIS TOWN A LIKE TWELVE POINT SEVEN PER CENT SO LIKE WAY AHEAD OF THE REST OF THE FIELD COMBINED IF HAILY WOURD WHEN NEW HAMPSHIRE YOUOULD EXPECT TO SEE A BIT OF AN UPSERCH FOR BUT LET'S ASSUME FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT BES THASTS WERE THE STATAR THE TRUMP IS THE NOMINY WELL THE REASON TRUMP WOULD BE THE NOMINY AND THE REASON THAT TRUMP PRESUMABLY WOULD BE A FORMIDABLE CHALLENGER TO JOBIDON IS BECAUSE AGAIN PEOPLE LOOK AT TWENTY NINETEEN AND THY LOOK AT TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND THEY SAY TWENTY NINETEEN WAS BETTER THAN TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND MOST SANE AND RATIONAL PEOPLE DON'T BLAME TRUMP FOR COVID BECAUSE HOW COULD YO POSSIBLY DO THAT THAT THEY'D BE A WEIRD THING TO DO JAME DIMON HERE HE RECENTLY SAID THAT THE REASON THE PEOPLE ARE VOTING FOR TRUMP IS BECAUSE THE ECONOMY UNDER DONAL TRUMP WAS BETTER I THINK WE SHOULD STOP AN SULTING O THE SIDE IN CLUDI MAGA I I MENTION POBICALLY MANE TIMES IT LOT I PEOBLE VOTI FOR PRESEN TRUM NOUT BECAUSE THEY BELIEV IN HIS CHAM WE NAUS BUT THEY LOOK AT SON THE THINGS YOU DID EGU THEA TNAMY I HO'S RIGHT ABOUT NAD OE THI SPAND ORT MON YE'S RGHT ABOUT POINT OUT ABOUT CHINA I NOW HE WA RIGHT ABOUT THAT YOUR SOME BAGLATIONS DO NOT CLOS PIT ABOUT BU SO THAT'S WHIDE AVOTING FORM I NEEN THE DEMI CRASH BEL MOR THOUGHT FUL WHEN THE TRUNG ABOUT MAGISY WHY NI NOT LIKE IN THIN NOT DONT ACLIG EVE RY ACT TI BET OF TRUMP IS NAT TO BE TO NAT IS JUST NOT TRU G HE IS RIGHT ABOUT ALL THAT SO YOU KNOW IT WOULD MAKE THIS LOT EASIER AS IF TRUMP IT JUS TALK ABOUT THAT AGAN TRUMP IS THE EASIEST CAMPAIN IN THE WORLD HIS CAMPAIGN INVOLVES LOOKING LIKE DONALD SOUTHERNLAND AT THE END OF INVATION OF THE BODYS SNATCHERS POINTING AT TROBIDON THAT'S THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN HE'S GOES AND THAT'S IT THAT'S THE CAMPAIGN RIGHT LOOK ADATGI THAT'S THE CAMPAIGN INSTEAD WERGAN ING AT THE GREASE FIRE SO APPARENTLY TRUMPS CAMP TRYING TO CLAIM THAT HE HAS PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY FOR EVERYTHING INVOLVING JANUARY SEX THAT'S A WEIRD CLAIM BECAUSE AGAIN THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DONAL TRUMPS SUR POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS AND DONALD TRUMPS PUBLIC DUTIES AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IT'SO THE ARGUMENTS THT HIS LAWYERS ARE NOW BEING FORCED TO MAKE ON BEHALF PRESIDENTIAL MUNITY ARE LITTLE WEIRD ACCORDING TO THE WALLSTRY JOURNAL THE LEGAL RECKONING FOR DONALD TRUMP ENTERED A CRITICAL STRETCH TUESDAY AS A WASHINGTON FEDERAL A PULLIC COURT SIGNALES IT WOULD REJECT THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S CLAIM HE'S IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION ON CHARGERS HE PLOTTED TO OVERTURN THE TWENTY TWENTY LECTION OUT BY THE WAY THIS DOESN'T SPEAK TO THE GUILT OR INNOCENCE HERE IT DOESN'T PEAK O WEATHER IT IS CRIMINAL TO AS SPOWS A SPECIOUS LEGAL THEORY WHICH IS IN MY OPINION WHAT DONALD TRUMP WAS DOING FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS THERE THAT'S NOT CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THATS JUST ARGUING REALLY REALLY DUM CRAP IN A COURT WHICH PEOPLE DO PRETTY FREQUENTLY IN THIS COUNTRY AS IT TURNS OUT BUT PUTTING THAT ASIDE THE PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY THURY THAT TRUMP IS PWENTING FOUR HERE IS JUST BAD IT'S NOT A GOOD PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY THEORY IT'S O HE IS SUGGESTING APPARENTLY THAT HE HAS IMMUNITY FOR LITERALLY EVERYTHING HE DID WHILE HE WAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN FACT TRUMP WARRNT OF BEDLUM IF HE WAS DENIED IMMUNITY HERE HE WAS EXPLAINING THERS  A Y TEMY MOIN I YOU HAE BE JORIN AT EI OSS THE WA TA WAN ASNOT EWAY GOS EHEISS PRESIDENT AS NE S THEOERE PANORAS BAS S IT'S A RSA THING I HAN WITIS ALLS I ULATION WHEN THEYS ARA THRETSE DEMOCRACY THAS TOREA RE TO OURSY OGASESOIT IS A THRATS DEMOCRACY TO REMOVE HIM FROM BALLATS WILL INALY THAT'S A THREATS DEMOCRACY IS NOT A THREATS DEMOCRACY TO SAY THE PRESIDENT IS NOT HAVE IMMUNITY FOR LITERALLY EVERYTHING HE DOES WHILE HE'S PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THE ARGUMENT HIS LAWYERS ARE MAKING IS THAT THE IMPEACHMENT CLAWS IN THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THAT THE PRESIDENT BE IMPEACH BEFORE HE IS CRIMINALLY TRIED FOR ANY SORT OF OFFENCE AND SO THE JRUDGES WERE LIKE I REALLY THE QUESTION THEY ASKED WAS IF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR EXAMPLE ORDERED SEAL TEEM SIX TO ASSASSINATE HIS POLITICAL RIVALS COULD HE THEN BE CHARGED ON THAT WITHOUT BEING IMPEACHED AND  TRUMPS LAYERS LIKE NO HE'D BET HAVE TO BE IMPEACHED A FIRST WHICH IS A WILD STATEMENT MEAN THAT THAT SEEMS VERY VERY DIFFICULT THE IDEA THAT THAT SOMEHOW THE PRESIDENT COULD ORDER THE MURDER OF HIS POLITICAL RIVALS AND IMMUNITY WOULD STILL GUARD HIM FOR THAT LIKE MURDER DOMESTIC AMERICAN POLITICAL RIVALS FIRST OF ALL THAT WOULD CREATES THE UM THAT WOULD CRAT THE PROSPECT VERY OBVIOUSLY AND EASILY OF THE PRESIDENT OF TE UNITED STATES LET SAY FOR EXAMPLE HERE IMPEACH AND HE HAD NOT YET BEEN CONVICTED BY THE SENATE SO OR SELT IM SIX TO KILL EVERY ONE IN THE SENATE WOULD VOTE FOR HIS CONVICTION AND NOW THERE'S NO ONE LEFT TO VOTE FOR HIS CONVICTION AND THUS CRIMINAL CONVICTION A AGAN THAT THISS IS THIS ARGUMENT IS NOT GOING TO FLY AND COURT IT'S JUST NOPLING TO S A TRUMP IS NOT GOING BE IMUN THE PROBAM IS IF WE'RE TAUGHT EVERY MOMENT WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT SORT OF STUF WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT JOBIDON IS AN AWFUL TERRIBLE VERY NOT GOOD PRESIDENT AND LET'S BE REAL ABOUT THIS WHEN IT COMES TO THE FEELING OF CASTS IN THE COUNTRY IT IS NOT SIMPLY COMING FROM TRUMP A TRUMPS FEST ARGUMENT IS IN FACTS AN ARGUMENT HE IS MAKING WHICH THAT THE THREATS ONDEMOCRACY IS COMING THAT THE CALL IT IS COMING FROM INSDE THE HOUSE JOBIDON IS THE ONE WHOSE CLAIMING HIS OPPONENTS ARE INSURRECTIONIST AND THEREFORE THEORETICALLY OUHT TO BE BAN FROM BALLOTS MEANWHILE WE DO LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE JOURNALISTS ROUTINELY  JOKE APPARENTLY ABOUT THE ASSASSINATION OF DONALD TRUMP CAUGHT ON A HOT MIKE YESTERDAY DONAL TRUMP WAS ARRIVING AND COURT ON THIS PARTICULAR CASE JOURNALISTS WERE CAUGHT ON A HOT MITE JOKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP BEING SHOT HE OMAN E O ME JAF CAS ASTINATION HOW GA WE TILL O KOW WHO THESE JOURNALISTS ARE BY THE I I'VE A FEELING THAT THEY WILL BE EXPOSED IN PROBABLY LOSE THEIR JOBS OVER SOMETHING LIKE THAT ALL OF THIS OBVIOUSLY CONTRIBUTING TO A FEELING OF GREAT UN EASE AMONG MEMBERS OF THEAMERICAN POPULATION ON BOTH SIDES VALLS HAVE SAID BEFORE WE HAVE NOW SET UP A MODEL BY WHICH VIOLENCE IS VERY LIKELY TO BREAK OUT NO MATTER WHO WINS THE ELECTION IF TONAL TRUMP WINS DO YOU THINK DOMOCRATS AREGN TO TAKE THAT LYING DOWN OR DO YOU THIN THA THEY'RE GOING TO CLAIM THAT DICTATORSHIP IS INEVITABLE NOW MAN IT'S LITERALLY WHACH RALIGHTEN IS ARGUING THAT THE NOSIES ARE IN CHARGE OF GOBIDON WINDS EMEN IF THEYF DOWN TRUMP WINDS AND IN IF FON TRUMP WINDS DO YOU THINK THAT THINGS WILL REMAIN CALM IN THE STREETS I THINK NOT MEANWHILE IF JOBIDON WINDS AT THIS POINT AND DOEL TRUMP HAS BEEN HIT BY HIS GO JAY IN TOO SEPARATE JURISTICTIONS IN WASHINGTON TO S AND FLORIDA DO YOU THINK THAT THAT DONAL TRUM SUPPORTERS ARE GOING TO TAKE THAT LYING DOWN OR IS HIS CASE THAT HE HAS BEEN RIGGED OUT OF THE ELECTION AGAIN GOING TO BE A LOT MORE CREDIBLE THIS TIME AT THAN IT EVES EVEN WAS LAST TIME THINGS ING AT VERY VERY NASTY IN THE COUNTRY WHICH OF COURSES IS WHY THE WASHINGTON POSED IS RUNNG PIECES LIKE VIOLENT POLITICAL THREATS SURGE AS TWENTY TWENTY FOUR BEGINS HLAUNTING AMERICAN  DEMOCRACY NOW THE ENTIRE ARTICLE IS LARGELY ABOUT THE EVILS OF DONAL FROM SUPPORTERS BUT LET'S BE CLEAR THE THREATS A VIOLENCE ARE NOT COMING FROM ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE ISLE THE AMOUNT OF A VIOLENCE THAT IS NOW BEING THREATEN AGAINST COMMONAMERICAN CITIZENS FORGET ABOUT PUBLIC OFFICIALS IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT AND I'S GON O CONTINUE TO RISE BECAUSE THE FEELING IS THAT INSTITUTIONS HAVE FAIL AND AS THE FEELING THAN INSTITUTIONS ARE FAILING GROWS IN IMPACT CHAOS COMES IN ITS WAY BY THE WAY THETE'S NOT A UNIQUELY AMERICAN PROBLEM YOU'RE CIRING TO SEE THIS LITERALLY ALL OVER THE WORLD THERE'S A FEELING THAT THE INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNMENT IN MANY WESTERN COUNTRY HAVE FAILED LARGE SWATHS OF THE POPULATION AND PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO TAKE TO THE STREETS IN RESPONSE TO BIG STORY THAT'S BEEN UNDER COVERED BY THE MEDIA HAS BEEN THIS HUGE FARMER PROTEST IN BERLIN ACCORDING O THESE SOCE TO PREST FARMERS BLOCKED HIGHWAY ACCESS ROADS IN PARTS OF GERMANY ON MONDAY AND SNARL TRAFFIC ELSEWHERE WITH THEIR TRACTORS LAUNCHING A WEEK OF PROTEST AGAINST TH GOVERNMENT PLAN TO SCRAP TAX BREAKS ON DEASIL

TAXBREAKS THOSE PROPOSALS WERE PART OF A PACKAGE TO FILL A GIANT EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLAR WHOLE IN THE TWENTY WENY FOR BUDGET THAT HOME BUDGET IS REALLY AN INVIRIMENTALIST WHOLE IN THE BUDGET HERE IS WHAT SOME OF THE PICTURES LOOK LIKE A MANU ECNSY IT IS INSANED ME THERE SNARLING OPLIC ALL OF BERLIN THERE SOME OFTHE VIDIO WEN TERY MUCH LIKE HE CANADIAN TRUNCKER'S PROTEST OVER THE COVENINETEEN SHUT DOWNS IN CANADA AND YOUR EN TO SEE THE SORT OF STUFF HAPPENING IN WESTERN CAPITALS ALL OVER THE PLACE THE PROTESTS ARE UNDER SCRUTINY AFTER A GRUP OF FARMERS ON THURSDAY PREVENTED THE VICE CHANCELOR ROBER HAYBACK FROM DISEMBARKING OF FAIRY AN A SMALL NORTH SEEPORT AS YOU RETURN FROM A PERSONAL TRIP TO AN OFFSHORE ISLAND THAT INCIDENT DREW CONDEMNATION FROM BOTH GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION FIGURES AS WELL AS THE FARMERS ASSOCIATION THERE LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE LEFT IN GERMANY HARD DEEPLY WORRIEDTHA THIS IS GOING TO BOOSE THE RIGHT WHICH OF COURSE IT WELL MEAN THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED BY THE WAIYT IN THE NETHERLANDS SO ALL OVER EUROPE THEREARE LOTS OF FARMERS HORE SAYING LESSENT YOU HAVE PUT YOUR GREEN DREAMS ON OUR BACK YOU AVE SAID THAT WE CAN'T FARMANY MORE YOU HVE PUT ALL SORTS O RESTRICTIONS ON OUR USE OF NITROGEN AND THE SOIL FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE BASICALLY FORCED US TO CONSOLIDATE ALL OF OUR FARMS AND TAKE OUT DEBT TO DO SO AND THE NEW PREVENTED US FROM DOING THE FARMING THIS IS WHAT LED TO THE GIANT DUTCH NITROGEN CRISIS WHICH IS STILL ROCKING THE COUNTRY SO THAT'S HAPPENING IN GERMANY IT'S HAPPENING IN THE NETHERLANDS AS WELL NO ALL OF THIS IS ZOM OU'S JUST PART AND PARCEL OF A BRADER RIGHT RIGHTWING UPRISING THAT IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE CONTINENT OVER IN POLAND YOU HAVE A TRUE CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS THAT IS BREAKING OUT AS WELL SO POLAND HAS VERY WEIRD KIND OF  GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE YOU'VE THE PRIME MINISTER WHO HAS MOST O THE POWER BUT OF THE PRESIDENT WHO HAS VEDO POWER AND THE ABILITY TO A PROVE GOVERNMENTS AND NOT A PROE GOVERNMENT YOU ELSESTO HAVE TWO SEPARATE CORTS THE SUPREME COURT AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL CORT OF JUSTICE IN POLAND AND THE SORT OF COVERED DIFFERENT AREAS WHATL TURNS OUT THIS DIVISION OF POWER HAS LED TO THE DOMINATION OF ONE OF THOSE DIVISIONS BY THE RIGHT WING AND ONE OF THOSE VISIONS BY A EUROPEAN INTOGRATIONIST PARTY LED BY DONALD TUSK WELL THIS IN TURN HAS LED TO A STAND OFF BETWEEN THESE TWO WINGS OF THE POLISH GOVERNMENT ACCORDING TO POLITICO IN AN DRMATIC ASK COLLATION OF POLAND'S BATTLE TO RESTORE RULE OF LAW THE POLICE ENTERD THE COUNTRY'S PRESIDENTIAL PALICE ON TUESDAY EVENING AND TOOK TWO MPS INTO CUSTODY HO HAD BEEN HIDING UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT WHOSE NAME IS UNDRICH DUDA AFTER BEING SENTENCE TO PRISON TRMS FOR ABUSE OF POWER YHOU ARREST CUT TO THE HART OF THE FIGHT BETWEEN DUDA AND THE NEW PRIMEMANISTR DONAL TUSK WHO IS SEEKING TO ENRAVEL EIGHT YEARS OF RULE BY THE NATIONALIST AND CONSERVATIVE LAW AND JUSTICE PARTY JUDA IS A LINE WITH PA S AND SELL S CONSIDERABLE ABILITY TO THWART TUSKS ATTEMPTS AT REFORM BASICALLY THE RE TWO CONVICTED LAWMAKERS WHO HAD BEN GIVEN A PARDON AND TUSK IS NOW ARGUING THAT THE PARDON WAS NO GOOD AND THE PRESIDENT SANG THE PARDON ABSOLUTELY WAS GOOD DUTUS AS HE PARDON THESE TWO AND TWENTY FIFTEEN DURING THEIR TRIAL FOR USING FIC DOCUMENTS IN AN EARLIER ATTEMPTOIN CRIMINATE COLISHAN ALLIES OF LAW AND JUSTIS THERE RE OPING TO DESTROY THAT SMALLER COLITION PARTY AND THEN INTEGRAT THE MEMBERS AND APPARENTLY THAT FAILED INTHE OVERNMENT BELOW PART IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN POLEN SUPREME COURT RULED THE PRESIDENTIAL PARDON WAS NOT EFFECTIVE BECASE IT WASH GRANTED BEFORE A FINAL VERDICT IN THE CASE SO THERE ARE THING THE CAMP PREEMPTIVELY GRANTO PARDON TBEFORE SOMEMODY'S BEEN CONVICTED IN CRIMINAL COURT BUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL C OS THE OTHER COURT WHICH USUALLY DESCRIBES CONSTITUTIONALLISTIONS THEY SAID THAT THE PARDON WAS IN ORDER SO N HAVE A BATTLE BETWEEN THE CONSTITUTIO AL TRIBUNAL AN THE SUPREMEPORT BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE PRESIDENT IN POLAND ALL OF THIS BECAUSE YOU BASICALLY HAVE GRIDLOCH IN POLAND OVER THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY THE PARLIAMENT OF POLAND IS BY CAMERAL BUT THE LOWER HOUSE IS CALLED THE SAME IN SPELD TS E J M S PRONOUNCE SAME IN IN SERE AMERICAN AND A THE BIGGEST PARTY THERE IS THE LAW IN JUSTICE PARTY THEY STILL HAVE A HUNDRED NINETY FOUR OUT FORHRNISIXTY SEETS IN THE PARLIAMENT AND SO THEY STILL DOMINATE A LOT OF THE PROCEEDING SO YOU HAVE THIS BREAK DOWN IN POLANS YO BREAK DOWN IN POLAND YOU HAVE BREAK DOWN IN GERMANY YOU HAVE BREAK DOWN IN THE NETHERLANDS YOU AVE BREAK DOWN IN FRANCE AS WELL SO ONE O THE BIG PROBES IN FRANCE RIGHT NOW IS THAT MANUAL MC CHRONE IS DEEPLY UN POPULAR THE RISING PARTY IS THE NATIONALIST PARTY THAT IS LED BY MARINE LAPEN RIGHT NOW THE LOPEN PARTY

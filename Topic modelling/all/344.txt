PUBLIC RATER INTERNATIONAL IT'S HIS AMERICAN WIFE A MI WERE GLASS TIT IS PROGRAM ROAD TRIP  I ONE BUSMAN'S HOLIDAY TIS WASHER PEETE LOVED RIDING THE BUS FROM CITY TO CITY UNTILL ONE LAST SEVEN DAY TRIP THI TOOK HIM OFF THE WHOLE DEAL  TO MEL SE OT HOW DO YOUVEN SAY THAT MERE SE MEL SE CAN A ROAD TRIP IN EUROPE SAVE A MARRIAGE ANSWERS WITH ONE CASE STUDY I THREE ON THE ROAD NATUCSITO AT THE AGE OF NINETY TOO COMMETTE AN GEORGE BURNES WAS STILL TRAVELLING ALL THE TIME MARGA ROCCIN BRIEF WE TRAVELLED WITH HIM WHAT IT IS LIKE WHEN BEING ON THE ROAD HAS BEEN YOUR JOB FOR DECADES IT FOR ILL PALL FOR JESUS SHIR TRICK ACHIEVES WHAT EVERY ONE ONCE WHEN THEY HIT THE ROAD SHE ACTUALLY FINES ADVENTURE AND IT IS NOT PRETTY STIMULUS I ON BUSMAN'S HOLIDAY WHALL REAGULAR LISTENERS TO A PROGRAMEY REMEMBERE DISHWASHER PEED HE TRAVELS FROM STATE TO STATE WASHING DISHES AND PUBLISHING HIZENE DISHWASHER USUALLYO ONLY STAYS IN ONE PLACE FOR A FEW WEIGS AND THEN HE TAKES THE GREYHON BUS TO THE NEXT TOWN LITLEY HE'S BEN LOVING IN PORTLAND BUT HE WAS ONLY TOO HAPPY TO GET BACK ON THE BUS I LIKE RIGT IN GREYHOLD OVER THE LAST DAY YEARS I FEAR I HAVE RETDEN AT LEAST A HUNDRED THOUSAND MILES ON GRAY HOUND AND TOTAL ABOUT FOUR SOLID MUNTHS OF MY LIFE HAVE BEEN SPENT CROOPED UP IN THEIR BUSSES I WOULD CONSIDER AT MY HOME AWAY FROM HOME IF ONLY I HAD HOME WHAT I LIKE MOST ABOUT GREYHOUND IS HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GET ANYWHERE ON THE BESS AIRE LING PASSENGERS LEFT COMPLAIN ABOUT THE FIVE EXCRUCIATING ME LONG HOURS THAT TAKES TO FLY FROM COAST COAST BUT ON THE BUSS THAT SAME DISTANCE TAKES THREE FULL DAYS TO COVER WHICH IS WHAT I THINK IS ABOUT THE PERFECT AMOUNT OF TIME FOR SUCH A TRIP I UNLIKE AIR PLANE FLIGHTS NO MOVIES ARE SHOWN ON GREYHOUND NO HAD SETS HANDED OUT NO FREE MAGAZINES AVAILABLE NO WAITRESSES FORCE BAGS OF PINATS ON YOU EVERY FIVE MINUTES ON THE BUSS PASSENGERS ARE LARGELY LEFT ALONE WITH THEIR THUGTS I HAVE THE THEORY ABOUT PEOPLE WHO RIDE GREYHOUND ABOUT HOW AS WE SIT ON THE BUST FOR HOURS AND DAYS WAITING TO REACH OUR DESTINATION WE TRAVEL IN WHAT I CALL A TRANSITIONAL STATE THINKING ABOUT WHERE WERE COMING FROM AND WHERE WERE GOING TO I KNOW I DO AND FOR MY TALKING TO OTHER PEOPLE ON THE BSS I KNOW MANY OTHERS DO AS WELL NGFOR EXAMPLE THIS ONE ROUTE I'VE RIDEN LOT GO SOUTH THROUGH CRESSENT CITY CALIFORNIA HOME WITH THA POLIC AN BAY MAXIUM SECURITY PRISON I WROTE NEXT TO THE SKY WHO'D BEEN LOCKED AWAY FOR FOURTEEN YEARS AND HAVE JUST GOTTEN OUT I CROSS THE AISLE FROM ME WAS A TEANATURE WITH THE BUS CUT ON HITS WAY TO BOOT CAMP WE TALKED FOR A WHILE BUT MOSTLY WE JUST SAT AND THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFERENT PLACES WE WERE HEADED N THEN TEN   FOR A LONG TIME I'E BEEN WANTING TO TAPERCORD TO STORIES I'VE HEARD ON TE BUSS THE DOCUMENT THIS PHENOMENON THAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT SO T'S PRETTY EXCITED WHEN THIS AMERICAN LIFE OFFERED TO SEND ME ON A GREYHOUND TRIP WITH THE FANCY TAPER QUARTER IN A SEVEN DAY A MAYROR PASS FOR A WEEK I COUL WANT TO ANY GREYHOUND ROUTE I CHOSE AND TAST MY THEORY ABOUT THE BUSS SO I PACKED UP A LOOF OF PENA BETTER N JELLY SANDWICHES AND BUNCH OF BANANAS AND STEPPD ON A GREYHOUND I SPENT THE FIRST TEN HOURS TROLLING DOWN THE COAST OF ORGAN I SO EAGER TO TALK WITH THE OTHER PASSENGERS I STAYED AWAKE ALL NIGHT EVEN THOUGH EVERYONE ELSE WAS SLEEPING IT WASN'T UNTIL WE STOPPED FOR BREAKFAST AND CRESSENT CITY AS FINALLY ABLE TO STRIKE UP A CONVERSATION STEVE WAS ABOUT FIFTY YEARS OLD SPORTED A BUSHY BEARD AND WORE AN OLIVE GREEN ARMY JACKET A LARGE WOODIN CRUCI FIXTANGLE FROM HIS NECK HE SAID HE WAS AN ITINERANT PREACHER AND THAT GREYHOUND WAS HIS CHAPEL WH I JUST PREACH IN MY OWN TIME YOU KNOW NOT INSPICITIC TIMES AN USILY TRY TOVOID AUDIENCES WHEN I DO SPEAK IS THAT WAY I I REDUCE THE  POSSIBILITIES OF REJACTION OR MOCKERY SO Y YOU AVOID YOU AVOID AUDIENCES THAN WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO WELL SEE I BELIEVE IN TRANSMISSION OF VOICE OR SPIRIT CAN TRANSMIT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DEGREES INTO THE WORLD I TIMES THREE HUNDRED SIX D DEGREES AND AND GREYHOUNDS A CONDUCIVE FOR FOR YEAR A TRAVELLING MINISTRE WELL IN THE FACT THAT I DO NOT HAVE MY OWN PRIVACY I LIKE IN A PRIVATE VEHICLE Y I THERE BECOMES A EITHER INTERMASHING OR CLASHING OF SPIRITS LIKE ON A CROWDED TYPE GREYHOUND SO I SOME TIMES THE THINGS ARE MORE HARMONIOUS ANOTHER TIMES E THE PEOPLE PICK AND POKE AN A THE SOLICIT OR REACTION SO NORMY YOU PREACHING ON THE BSS WOULD CON WITH YOU JUST TALKING TO THE PERSON SITTING NEXT YOU MOST MY PREACHING A IS DONE BY MY SOLP JOST SPEAKING INTO THE AIR O THOUGH WITHOUT ANOTHER HE WOULD BEIN BE IN THERE A YOU MIGHT BE ONE THE FIRST YIM TO BE INLISS I S EVER REALLY LISTEN TO ME OR ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IN IN MY PRESENCE STEVES MINISTERY WAS NOT LIMITED TO THE TECHINGS OF PRICE BUT ALSO INCLUDED HEALTHY TOS OF PRAISE FOR NATURAL MEDICINE LIKE CANABUS AND OPIAN I THOUGHT I WAS AGREEING WITH HIM WHEN I SAID THAT IT DID SA METIULUS THAT FARMASUITABLE COMPANIES SI WES OLD NATURE BACK TO US BUT STEVE TOOK A FENCE AND PULLED OUT A BALL OF AMBASALL WHICH HE DESCRIBED A STIXTY PER SENT GRANE OUT CALL PLASPENSA CANE WHICH SIS A CEMICALL A AS A CHEMICAL SIMILAR TO THE THE NATURALLY CURRING COCANG AND A SO TTHE PERSON WIT LET IT WOR WELL IT JUST A LITTLE TOPICAL ANIS THETIC WHICH IS LIKE A LOCAL NUMBER AND AS SO THEY A THEY TALK ABOUT TWO DAY AND A THINGS OF THAT NATURE JUST SOMETHING  CERTAILY NOT A  SENTRAL NERVOUS SISTEM A RELAXIONS LIKE THE OLD BIAM POPY WHICH I CONSIDER MORE A VALUABLE PLANT GIS IS PAIN RELIEFU SAGALOG JUST A LITTLE NEP JUST A LITTLE NET NOW SOS THAT NUMBING YOUR HOLE MOUTH NOW WELL IT TAKE SI IK SPOCK TEN FIFTEEN SECONDS IT'S NOT EXTUALLY THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE FACK YES IT IS IT IS ACTUALLY BELIEVED HER NOT NOMMING AND A VERY PLESS STEVE CONTINUED TALKING BUT IT BECAME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WAS SAYING AS HIS SPEECH SLURRD BY THE END OF OUR FIFTEEN MINUTE TALK HE TOLD ME AS THE LONGEST CONVERSATION HE HAD IN THE LAST THREE

DAVID MAMMOT WOULD WRITE IF TAVID MAMMOT ROAD SEEINGS WHERE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WAS IT STAY   WE HAD DONE TO THE BROILER ROOM ALL THROUGH DINNER THERE'S THIS CONSTANT TRAFFIC OF FOUNDS INCLUDING AT ONE POINT FOR CHEERLEADERS THEYRE WEARING GEORGE'S SKIRTS AND TIGHT SWETTERS AND THEIR NERVOUS ENERGY FILLS THE ROOM GOGE GEORGE GO THEY SCREAM OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHILE THEY SHAKE AND WIGGLE AND DO EIR SPLITS AND RATTLED THEIRE CRAPE PAPER PALMPOMS THEN FLOORSHOW OVER THEY RUN OUT IN A SINGLE FILE AS IF EVERYTHING THEY DO IS PART OF A ROUTINE THEN INCOMES THE SHAFT TO ASK FOR GEORGE'S AUTOGRAPH BUT GEORGE BURNS LIKES THESE INTRUIONS HE'S NOURISH BY THEM WHEN IT'S FINALLY QUIETY SAYS TO ME AREN'T PEOPLE NICE BECAUSE I'M A REPORTER I'M A BLIP BUT THE PUBLIC GETS HIS FULL ATTENTION HE ESTABLISHIS IKE CONTACT WITH EACH APPROACHING FAN AND HE SMILES AT THEM AND HE ASK HOW TEY'RE DOING AND WHEN HE LEAVES TE BROILER ROOM HE'LL CHOOSE THE MOST COMPLICATED ROOT SLOWLY THREADING HIS WAY THROUGH THE TABLES OF THE MAIN DINING ROOM TOUCHING PEOPLE ON THE SHOULDER LIGHTLY AND SAYING THINGS LIKE DON'T PAY THE CHECK  WHILE WE'RE ON THE ROAD I PROBABLY SEE HIM DO HIS ACT FIVE TIMES EACH TIME IT SOUNDS TOLY SPONTINEOUS LIKE HE'S MAKING IT UP RIGHT THERE JUST RIFFING FOR THE CROWD EVEN THOUGH GIVER TAKE A GAGGAR TO IT'S THE EXACT SAME ACT HIS BEEN DOING FOR FIFTEEN YEARS RE  E A    A   E  Y   RERE   WHAT'S AMAZING ABOUT ALL THIS IS THAT ON THE SURFACE THE ACT DOESN'T SEEM TO VERY FROM CITY TO CITY BUT TO GEORGE IT'S AN ETERNAL WORK IN PROGRESS EVERY NIGHT HE MAKES MICROSCOPIC CHANGES MAYBE HE'LL DECIDE TO SINK YOUNG AT HEART BEFORE OLD BONES WHEN HE DOES AS HE GETS ALL WORKS OUP ABOUT IT THINKS ABOUT IT ALL DAY LONG BUT THIS IS HOW HE'S BEEN ABLE TO BE ON THE ROAD FOR SO LONG THIS IS HOW HE KEEPS THE ACTS FEELING FRESH FOR HIMSELF SOMETIMES THI'LL CHANGE UPONS LONE HE HAS A GAGNES ACT ABOUT PEOPLE HAVING TO RETIRE WHEN THEIR SEVENTY HE SAYS WHEN I WAS SEVENTY I HAVE PEMPLES BUT ONE DAY

THAT'S A SAVIGIANS ROAD TRIP I AM ON A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF ROAD TRIP THE ROAD TRIP I'M ON IS NOT ABOUT ADVENTURE AND UNPREDICTABILITY THE ROAD TRIP I'M ON IS ABOUT MAKING TURE THA EVERYTHING IS CESSANE THIS IS THE SECRET TO GEORGE BURNS IS LONGGEVITY OF HOW HE'S BEEN ABLE TO STAY ON THE ROAD FOR SO LONG WITHOUT GOING CRAZY HE WAKES UP AT A CERTAIN TIME HE GOES TO SLEEP AT A CERTAIN TIME WHEN

SHOULD SAY TO DAY SHOW US A RERUN FROM A FEWARS BACKS EVERYBODY HEAR YOUR HEARING AND THE STORY IS JUST A BIT OLDER NOW AND MI HERE IS MY MY FRIEND CALLIN MUCHLER IS THIRTY SIX AND TO THIS DAY HE TALKS ABOUT HIS CHRISTMASES AS A KID THAT'S BECAUSE HIS PARENTS WERE DETERMINED TO MAKE THE MAGIC OF CHRISTMAS COME ALIVE FOR THEIR THREE KITS CALLIN OTAM AND ERICA BUT THEY WENT FURTHER THAN ANY PARENTS I KNOW THEY WANTED TO BE REAL REALLY REAL THIS WAS IN THE NEARBRUSH TOHOHO CHRISTMAS BUT A DARKER READIER ONE LIKE THAT ONE YEAR WHEN CALLIN WAS SEVEN AND HIS DAD SENT HIM TO THE GARAGE FOR SOME FIREWOOD AND I HEARD SOME BELLS AND A KIND OF FREAKT ME OUT AN SO I LIKE GRAN INSIDE WAS LIKE AN MY GUODU GUIYES LIKE I SWEAR I HEARD SOME BELLS AND MY OWN MY DELS LIKE NO WAY REALLIERON I WENT

WI SAID ON CHRIS CRANGL ADAM WAS FOR AND HE SAYS THIS IS IS EARLIEST MEMORY OF CHRISTMAS ALL THE MUCHELOR KIDS HAVE MEMORIES LIKE THIS PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY TALKED ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE COLLIN AND ADAM DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS JUST ONE SANTA CLAUS LIVING AT THE NORTH POLE THE MUCHLOR FAMILY HAD THEIR OWN MYTHOLOGY WITH ITS OWN LOGIC THERE WASN'T JUST ONE SANTA BUT A NET WORK OF SANTAS ALL WORKING TOGETHER AS CHRISTMAS HELPERS CHRIST CRINGLE WAS JUST ONE OF THEM A WORKING MANSANTA AND JUST LIKE A GUY IN A NIGHTSHIFT FROM HELL HE WAS EXHAUSTED WE CAN OV WERE LIKE ALMOST HELPING HIM DYNAMIC WITH SUCH THAT IT WAS LIKE HE WAS IN A ROUGH PLACE AND WE WERE LIKE TRYING TO HELP HIM AND SO I THINK WE TALKED WITH HIM FORABIDN AND AN  PUT HIM ON HIS WAY OR VISITORS LIKE CHRIS APPEARED EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS OR SO IN THE BAND OF WOODS DIVIDING THEIR HOUSE IN HARRINGTON PARKNEW JERSEY FROM A NEAR BY GOLF COURSE NEVER THE SAME GUY NEVER IN EXACTLY THE SAME PLACE THEY'D BE DISHEVELLED BEARDED AND HORSE FOIST ABANDONED BY THEIR SKIDDISH AND SURPRISINGLY LOSIBLE REINDEER AND SEARCHING FOR THE MUCHELORS WHOS HOME ADDRESST THEY NEVER QUITE FIGURED OUT THE MUCHELORS ALSO HAD A FAMILY ELF JECCO WHO THE KIDS NEVER SAW BUT WHO APPARENTLY LIVED IN THE ATTIC FOR A FEW WEEKS BEFORE CHRISTMAS THE KIDS WOULD HEAR NOISES COMING FROM UPSTAIRS HAMMERING WOLKING AND WHEN CHRISTMAS WAS OVER THEY'D FIND WOODSCRAPS IN THE ATTIC FROM THE GIFTS HE'D MADE FOR THEM PROOFED THAT JECO HAD BEEN THERE BOTH THEIR FATHER AND GRANDFATHER GREW UP WITH JECCA THE GRANDFATHER SPECIALLY LOVED TO TELL SCARY STORIES ABOUT HOW MEAN JECCO COULD BE AND SO EVERY CHRISTMAS THE FAMILY SPENT HOURS COMING OVER TH DEETAILS OF JECO WEN THEIR VISITORS COMPARING THEM TO PREVIOUS CHRISTMASMAS AND TISIPATING THE NEXT WHEN YOU ASK THE MU CHELOR KIDS WHICH CHRISTMAS VISITOR WAS THE ONE WHO OUT DID THE REST THERE IS NO QUESTION CHRISTMAS EVE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR COLLIN WAS EIGHT ADAM WAS FIVE ERICA WAS TWO THE FAMILY WAS OUT TAKING THEIR USUAL WALK AND ON THIS NIGHT THEY WENT DOWN TO THE GOLF COURSE IT WAS FOGGY AND DARK HERE'S ADAM AND THEN IN THE DISTANCE WE SEE THIS SILHOUETTE OF A SHADOW SCAMPERING FROM MY TREED A TREE AND LIKE HITS GOLF COURSE IS AN OPEN WIDE SPACES AND LOOKING LIKE IT DOESN'T THEY DON'T WANT US TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE THERE AND TI DATS AS WHAT IT'S TO FIND OUT WHO THAT IS ANS WE START WALKING FASTER TRY TO CATCH UP WITH THE SKY ONLY COME UPON HIM HE IS IN THIS I NO VERY WORN DIRTY SANTA CLAUS SUIT THATS CONT OF  THIS GREENISH BROWND TIM AND HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF AS CLAUS OFFER AND HE'S ONE OF MANY SORT OF THE THE SANTA CLAUS AND INCARNATIONS SOME SOR ANDTHAT HE GOES INTO FULL EXPLANATION BUT HE' DESN'T LY SOME HI SPIANCE THAT I CAN WE MENTION AN CHRISCRANGON LIKE OEIN A CHRIS CLAUVS HAD A WORN SACK AND BEGAN PULLING OUT CHRISTMAS BUT THE PRESENCE FOR VERY ODD THERE WAS VEGETABLES I HAD A BROCHLY AND ON ONION AND THEN HE ALSO I AND GAVE US SOME BONES AND THAT SORT OF COMES TO THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AS HE BROKE OUT ONE BONE IN PARTICULAR AND HE SAID THIS IS ONE OF THE BONES FROM THAT HIS YOU KNOW THE ORIGINAL RUDOLPH AND I USE IT TO CALL THE R ANGER AGAIN HEARS CALLIN AND THEIR SISTER ERICA AND LITERLLY WHEN HE BROKE OUT BONES AND START BLOWING ON THEM WE WERE LIKE ONL MY GOD NOW THIS IS CRAZY MADE NO NOISE WE COULDN'T HEAR IT BUT HE SAID IT WAS A PITCH THAT ONLY THE RANDEER CULD HER AND WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT RUDOLPH IT WASN'T LIKE RUDOLPH TE BED KNOWS RANGEER IT WAS LIKE HE CAN OF WAS HONORING THE HISTORY OF RUDOLPH AS LIKE SOME YOU A RANGEER THAT AT AT THEY ALL HONOURED AND THE FACT THAT HE HAD SOME OF THESE BONES OF RUDOLPH AND WAS USING THEM TO CALL TO THE RANGER JUST IT WOULD MAD SENSE TO US YOU KNOW LIKE IT WAS LIKE THAT MAKE SENSE THE DETAILS WERE PERFECTLY CALIBRATED AS ONLY PEOPLE WHO KNOW YOU AS WELL AS YOUR PARENTS CAN GET JUST RIGHT HERE'S ADAM AND THAT'S WHAN OUR COSCURY HE OFFERED ALL THE KIDS HE SAID IRE CAN ONLY INVITE THE KIDS BUT YOU GASK MORE COME ON THE ON A SLAY DO I COME TO THE NORTH POTH M AND WE JUST AT THERE YOU KNOW FROZEN WOLL I COULD SAY YES THE ANSWERS KNOW YOU KNOW THE TRUTH IS LIKE IN SOME OLD MAN THAT YOU JUST MET IN THE DARK GOLF COURSE ON CHRISTMAS EVE ACTUALLY ASKS M AND MY BROTHER MY SISTER IF WE WANTE GO WITH HIM SOMEWHERE THAT WE HAVE NO IDEA EY WHILE THAT MIGHT BE THE COOLEST THING OF ALL TIME IT MIGHT ALSO BE LIKE O THE END OF LIFE AS I KNOW IT AGAIN ERICA WHO REMEMBER WAS TOO AT THE TIME AND I REMEMBER SCREAMING AND NOT WANTING TO GO I WAS JUST TERRIFIED ACTUALLY THAT INVITATION TO THE NORTH POLE THAT NEVER HAPPENED AT LEAST NOT THE WAY THEY REMEMBER  A THIS IS A RECORTING FROM THAT CHRISTMAS EVE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOR ERICA ADAM AND CALLIN HAD JUST COME BACK FOR ME TO CLASS ON THE RECORDING THE KID SEEM HAPPY AND HOPPED UP ON A GENALON THEY TALK ABOUT CLAUS BUT IN THE ENTIRE ECOURTING NEVER MENTION ANY INVITATION TO THE NORTH POLE WHAT YOU HEAR INSTEAD IS THE GRANDFATHER SUGGESTING HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF HE HAD ASKED YO TAKE THE NORTH POLE THEN THEIR FATHER GLENCHEMPSON  BEHOLD THE POWER OF SUGGESTION THAT'S HOW IT SEEMED LIKE A LOT OF IT WORKED THE MUCHLER PARENTS MAKING SUGGESTIONS AN ADDING DETAILS AND THEN RETELLING IT ALL YEAR AFTER YEAR CHRISTMAS WAS A BIG TOPIC OF CONVERSATION AND THE MUCHLER PARENTS ENCOURAGED THEIR KIDS WITH THE MOST EXCITING VERSIONS OF WHAT HAPPENED ON THIS NIGHTS TO THE POINT WHERE THE STORIES GAINED AND UNSTOPACLE MOMENTUM  AND  AS THE MUCHLOR KIDS GOT OLDER THINGS AS THEY DO CHANGED EACH OF THE KIDS DEALT WITH A DIFFERENTLY BOTH CALLAN AND ERICA SAY THEY KNEW IT A CERTAIN POINT TO NOT TALK ABOUT JECO AND THE OTHERS TO PEOPLE OUTSIDE THEIR CLOSEST CIRCLES BUT ADAM DIDN'T GET THAT AT ALL ADAM LOVES TO TELL A GOOD STORY HE COULDN'T NOT TELL THIS ONE AND HE BELIEVE TOLE HARTEDLY IN HIS EXPERIENCES EVEN AS A TEA NATUR IN PUBLIC SCHOOL IN NEW JERSEY AND IT HAD CONSEQUENCES WHEN ADAM WAS IN FIFTH GRATE HE DEFENDED HIS STORIES ABOUT CLASS AND CHRIS AND THE REST IN FRONT OF HIS WHOLE CLAS IT GOT SO CONFONTATIONAL WITH ADAM TELLING THE WHOLE GROUP HOW WRONG THEY WERE BHUT THE TEACHER ENDED OF CALLING ADAM'S PARENTS TELLING THEM THAT IT ALMOST STARTED A FIGHT AND ASKING THEM TO PLEAD ES TO TELL ADAM TO STOP TALKING ABOUT IT ADAM REMEMBERS MANY ARGUMENTS LIKE THIS WELL INTO MIDDLE SCHOOL PEOPLE WOULD CALLMAN IDIOT OR WEIRD AND HE WOULD INSIST THAT THESE EVENTS WERE TRUE HE WAS THERE IT WAS REAL YOU GUIS OR CRASE NOT ME THE NEXT YEAR SIX GRATE ADAM WAS THAT HIS GRAND PARENTS HOUSE AT CHRISTMAS TIME WHEN HIS GREAT AUNT BLANCH MADE SOME OFFHANDED COMMENT ABOUT WHICH UNCLE PLAYED WHAT PART WHAT YEAR BACK WHEN THEY WERE KIDS ADAM WALKED HIMSELF THROUGH THE LOJICT OF WHAT SHE WAS SAYING AND HE KNEW WRIHTE

EMBARRASS I WAS VERY EMBARRASSED ADAM FELT BETRAYED AND WAS ANGRY ABOUT IT FOR YEARS ONE YEAR HE CAME HOME FROM COLLEGE AND ACCUSED IS PARENTS FOR BEING THE REASON HE COULDN'T TRUST ANY ONE ENOUGH TO HAVE A SERIOUS GIRL FRIEND NOT TOO DIFFERENT FROM THE SORTS OF SPEECHES LOTS OF KIDS MAKE TO THEIR PARENTS AT THAT AGE EXCEPT IT WAS ABOUT CANTA EVEN HE ADMITS IT WAS PRETTY EXTREME SO THIS ONE THING MADE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU COULDN'T TRUST YOUR PARENTS EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE TRUSTWORTHY PARENTS WELL IT WAS IT WAS THAT IT WAS THE FOR ME IT WAS THE INTRICACY AND THE PLANNING OF LIKE YOU SPENT SEVEN

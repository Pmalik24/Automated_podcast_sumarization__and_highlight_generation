IS FOR YOU AND NOW WITHOUT FURTHER ADO I WILL ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AND AS ALWAYS I WILL STRIVE TO BE AS THOROUGH AS POSSIBLE AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE AND AS CONCIS AS POSSIBLE OUR FIRST QUESTION IS ABOUT OBSTAIMING FROM THOUGHTS AND IN ANSWERING THIS QUESTION WERE GON ASKIRT RIGHT UP AGAINST THE TOPIC THAT IHAVE COVERED BEFORE ON THE PODCAST WHICH IS OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER TIS A VERY SERIOUS DISORDER AND YE CAN HAVE A RANGE OF SEVERITY BUT PEOPLE WITH TRUE OS D SUFFER A LOT FROM OBSESSIONS THESE ARE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS AND COMPULSIONS WHICH ARE THE BEHAVIORS TYPICALLY ASSOCIATE WITH THOSE THOUGHTS I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DEFINE OC D REALLY CLEARLY SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS AND THE DESIRE TO OBSTAIN FROM THOUGHTS VERSIS OS D AND WHERE THERE MIGHT BE SOME OVERLAPE THERE THE FUNCTIONAL DEFINITION OF OC D THAT REALLY PERTAINS TO THE DISORDER OFBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER OS D AS OPPOSED TO YEN WE CALL PEOPLE NAURODIC OR WE SET YOU HAVE OS D OR I'M SO OS D ABOUT THIS OR OS D ABOUT THAT THAT'S BECOME KIN COMMON US OVE THETHE ACRANIM OS D BUT TRUE OS D IS A SITUATION IN WHICH THE ENGAGING IN A PARTICULAR COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR DOES NOT S ERVE TO REDUCE THE INTENSITY OR THE FREQUENCY OF THE BSESSIONS IN FACT IT MAKES IT WORSE ASO A THE TYPICAL THING THAT WE HEAR THESE DAYS IS OH YOU'RE SO O C D OR HESO C D OR SHESO SEED OR I'M SO O S D NOW IF SOME ONE IS O C D IN THAT SENSE OKCASE AN NOT THE THE CLINICAL DISORDER BUT OSEEDING THE SENS THAT YOUNOW THEIR THEY'RE REALLY CLEAN THEYRE REALLY FASTIDIOUS THEY NEED EVERYTHING PERFECT HOWEVER THAT PERSON CAN ACHIEVE SOME LEVEL OF CALM AND COMFORT THAT'S FAIRLY LONG LASTING IF EVERYTHING'S CLEAN IN PERFECT WELL THEN THAT'S NOT OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND AS WE VENTURING TO ANSWERING THE QUESTION ABOUT INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS AND THE DESIRE TO ABSTAIN FROM CERTAIN THOUGHTS A PERSON WITH TRUE O C D WELL KEEP CLEANING AND CLEANING OR WASHING THEIR HANDS OR OR ARRANGING THINGS AT PERFECT RIGHT ANGLES BUT THE MORE THEY DO IT THE MORE THEI'RE ANXIETY GOES UP A PERSON WHO HAS MORE TYPICAL A CASH WE DON'T REALIEVEN HAVE A LANGUAGE FOR THIS NOWADAYS UNFORTUNATELY BUT THE SORT OF PERSON THAT'S EXTREMELY PARTICULAR THEY NEED THINGS A CERTAIN WAY AND THEYRE VERY DRIVEN TO RESOLVE THINGS AND DO THINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT THINGS ARE DONE IN A CERTAIN WAY OR HANDLED IN A CERTAIN WAY WELL IF THAT PERSON CAN EXPERIENCE RELIEF FROM ENGAGING IN LET'S SAY EXERCISE OR FROM CLEANING RIGHT YOU SAY YOU'RE SO S D ABOUT EXERCISE WELL BUT IF EXERCISING FOR AN HOUR OR EVEN TWO HOURS IN THE MORNING MAKE SOMEBODY REALLY CALM THE REST OF THE DAY AND THEY DON'T NEED EXERCISE WELL THEN THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY TRUE O C D THEY DON'T NESURELY HAVE A DISORDER RELATED TO EXERCISE HOWEVER IF THEY'RE EXERCISING FOR TWO HOURS IN THE MORNING AND THAN THEY FIND THEY CAN'T CONCENTRATE ON ANOTHER THINGS AND THEIRE DESIRE TO EXERCISE JUST INCREASEIS AN INCREASES AND BECOMES INTRUSIVE FOR THEM DISTRUPTING THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGHOUT THE DAY WELL THEN THAT'S FALLING IN THERES THE UMBRELLA OF WHAT WEL CALL A TRUE DISORDER S WE WANT A HIGH LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE QUESTION IS ABOUT A DESIRE TO ABSTAIN FROM THOUGHTS AND THE QUESTION IS IN YOUR DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR ONOLEMPKI I SHOULD JUST MENTION DOCTORONOLEMPKI IS THE DIRECTOR OF OUR DUAL DIAGNOSIS EDICTION CLINIC AT STAMFORD UNIVERSY SCHOL MEDICINE SHE'S THE AUTHOR OF THIS INCREDIBLE BOOK DOPOMINATION THAT I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD READ I DO BELIEVE EVERYONE SHOULD READ THAT BOOK SO IMPORTANT FOR THE ATTICT AND NON ATTIC TO LIKE BECAUSE IT DEALS WITH BASELY THE STATE OF OUR LIFE NOWDAYS RE LIVING IN THIS DOPOMINE RICH WORLD WHERE WE CAN QUICKLY BECOME DOPOMEN TO PLEADED WHICH IS TERRIBLE LEADS THE DEPRESSION IN ADDITION TO THINGS LIKE A DICTION IN SOME FOLKS ET CETERA ONA WAS A GUEST ON THE PODCAST YOU CAN FINE HER EPISODE AT HUBERMAN LABDOK CALM JUST PUT ANA I THINK SHE'S THE ONLY GUES WE'VE HAD THUS FAR WHOSE A NAME IS ON US OILL JUST POP UP THEIR THE ENTIREWEPSIDE IS CEARCHABLE BUT IF YOU WANT A LISTEN TO THAT EPISODE OR WATCH THAT EPISODE HOU CAN ACCESS IT HUBERMANLABDOK CALM QUESTION IS IN YOUR DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR ONOLEMPKI YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT ABSTAINING FROM PEOPLE'S DRUG OF CHOICE FOR THIRTY DAYS TO RESET THE DOPAMIN REWARD PATHWAY INDEED THAT IS THE PRESCRIPTIVE THAT DOCTOR ONOLEMPKI GIVES FOR M OST ALL EDICTIONS AND FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM MILDER EVEN SEVERE DEPRESSION RELATED TO DOLE MEAN SEEKING BEHAVIORS SOCHIOMEDIA VIDIO GAMES SEXS FOOD ET CETERA HOWEVER OF COURSE IN THE INSTANCE OF FOOD OR IN SOME OTHER DDICTIONS YOU CAN'T OBSTIN FOR THIRTY DAYS I THAT WOULD BE TERRIBLE TO OBSTAIN FOR FOOD FOR THIRTY DAYS I'M SURE PEOPLE HAVE DONE IT  BUT IT IS NOT HEALTHY TO DO CERTAIN THINGS LIKE ALCOHOL AND DRUGS PEOPLE CAN ABSTAIN THIRTY DAYS IN EFFORTS TO NEVER GO BACK TO THEM AGAIN THERE ARE CASES OF SEVERE ALKOHOL OR OPIAT DEPENDENCE WHERE PEOPLE CAN'T GO COLD TURKEY OR THEY RISK DYING SO THERE THEY NEED TO REALLY WORK WITH A OF PHYSICION BUT THE THIRTY DAY RESET OF THE DOPAMEAN SYSTEM IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY REAL AND THAT PRETENCE TO MOST PEOPLE THAT IS IT'S GOING TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE FOR MOST PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH EITHER BEHAVIORAL WHAT ARE SOMETIMES CALLE PROCESS EDICTIONS OR OTHER TYPES OF EDICTIONS INCLUDING SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES THE QUESTION CONTINUES YOU SAID YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ONA HOW TO ABSTAIN IF YOUR DRUG OF CHOICE IS A THOUGHT OR NARRATIVE AS OPPOSED TO A SUBSTANCE OR BEHAVIOR THE QUESTION CONTINUES AS FAR AS I CAN TELL YOUR DISCUSSION WITHON A MOVED ON BEFORE YOU ASKED HER THE QUESTION WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO DISCUSS STRAGIES FOR ABSTAINING FROM ADDICTIVE THOUGHTS AND NARRATIVES O CASE O LETS TALK ABOUT IN TRUCIVE THOUGHTS AND LET'S START OFF BY ASKING OURSELVES WHAT IS A THOUGHT IN THE REALM OF NEUROBIOLOGY WE HAVE SENSATIONS WHICH ARE THE A PROCESSES BY WHICH ARE NURON'S NERVE CELLS CONVERT LIGHT PHOTONS SOUND WAVES TOUCH MECHANICAL PRESSURE ET CETERA INTO ELECTRICAL SIGNALS AND CHEMICAL SIGNALS THAT HEAD IN TO OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM INCLUDING OUR BRAIN AND THEN OUR BRAIN LEAST WE THINK MC SENSE OF THEM AND HELP US NAVIGATE THE WORLD THAT WERE IN CASE OF THE SENSATION PART IS A PURE TRANSFORMATION OF MECHANICAL INFORMATION OR IN SOME CASES CHEMICAL INFORMATION LIKE SMELL CHEMICALS LITERALLY VOLATILE CHEMICALS FLOATING ROUND IN THE WORLD OR BROUHT INTO YOUR NOSE AND YOUR NURONS INOURAL FACTORY BULB CONVERT THOSE INTO ELECTRICAL ND CHEMICAL SIGNALS THAT YOUR BRAIN CAN UNDERSTAND PERCEPTIONS OR YOUR IDEA OF WHAT THOSE SIGNALS OUT IN THE WORLD ARE EITHER BECAUE YOUR PAYING ATTENTION TO THEM OR FOR SOME OTHER REASON YOU DECIDE THAT A STOP SIGN IN FRONT OF YOU IS READ AND THAT ON THE SIGN BEHIND IT IS WHITE AND THAT THE SKY IS BLUE OR CLOUDY THOSE ARE PERCEPTIONS  SWE HAVE SENSATIONS AND PERCEPTIONS THEN WE HAVE EMOTIONS WHICH ARE THESE THINGS THAT INCLUDE THE MIND IN BODY THAT ON ARE RELATED TO NEUROMODULATORS LIK DOPLE MEAN CERETONAN ET CETERA ALTHOUGH THOSE CHEMICALS DO OTHER THINGS AS WELL AND THEOF COURSE WE HAVE BEHAVIORS ACTIONS EVERYTHING FROM ME MOVING MY PEN ON A PIECE OF PAPER TO WALKING RUNNING ET CETERA THOUGHTS ARE A FIFTH CATEGORY OF NUURAL FUNCTIONING THAT WE REALLY NEED TO DEFINE BUT THAT DOESN'T HAVE AS STRICT A DEFINITION AS SENSATIONS PERCEPTIONS OR FEELING OR ACTION BUT THOUGHTS ARE REAL MIG WE ALL KNOW THIS THOUGHTS ARE REAL AND ONE WAY THAT WE CAN DEFINE THOUGHTS IS THAT THOUGHTS ARE PERCEPTIONS THAT INCLUDE DATA FROM THE PAST PRESENT OR FUTURE O OR COMMINATIONS OF PAST AND PRESENT OR PRESENT AND FUTURE OR FUTURE AND PAST I'M NOT TRYING O GIVEN OVERLY COMPLICATE DEFINITION HERE BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO ANSWER A QUESTION ABOUT HOW TO ABSTAIN FROM THOUGHTS IN A REALLY DIRECT AND ACTIONABLE WAY WE REALLY NEED TO ADDRESS WHAT OUR THOUGHTS SO THOUGHTS ARE PERCEPTIONS THAT ARE GENERATED INTERNALLY MIT WE DON'T NEED ANY EXTERNAL SENSATION IN ORDER TO HAVE A THOUGHT WE CAN CLOSE OUR EYES WE COULD BE IN SENSORY ISOLATION FOR THAT MATTER WEBE FLOATING WITH NO GRAVITY AND WE C N HAVE A THOUGHT THOUGHTS TEND TO RUN PRETTY MUCH AUTOMATICALLY IN THE BACKGROUND ALL THE TIME SOME PEOPLE REFER TO THIS AS CHATTER IN THE BACK OF OUR MINDS IN A VERY UNSTRUCTURED WAY AND THEN IF WE FORCE OUR THOUGHTS TO BE STRUCTURED BECAUSE WE DECIDE THEY NEED TO BE OR IF SOMETHING IN OUR ENVIRONMENT CAPTURES ORE PERCEPTION THEN OUR THOUGHTS TEN TO BE STRUCTURED LETME GIV AN EXAMPLE FI'M JUST WALKING AROUND IF THERE WERE A WAY IN WHICH WE COULD BROADCAST MY THOUGHTS ON TO A SCREEN WE WOULDN'T DO THAT BUT THOSE THOUGHTS WOULD BE A MIXTURE OF SEMI COMPLETE SENTENCES AND GIBBERISH HOWEVER IF SOMEBODY STOPS ME ANS AS HIGH I'M GOOD TO SEE YOU WHAT AEYOU DOING TO DAY AND I START ANSWERING WELL THEN MY THOUGHTS ARE SUDDENLY BEING DRIVEN BY AN EXTERNAL STIMULUS THEIR QUESTION AND SOME INTERNAL IDEAS MEMORY OF WHO I AM AND WHAT I'M DOING THAT DAY SO PASSED ANT PRESENT AND SO ON AND SO THOUGHTS BE COMESTRUCTIURED SO WHEN WE HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT HOW TO ABSTAIN FROM THOUGHTS WE NEED TO BE ADDITIONALLY SPECIFIC AND REALLY PIN POINT THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO ABSTAIN FROM THOUGHTS WE DON'T WANT PRESUMABLY EITHER BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO REPETITIVE AND DISTRACTING OR BECAUSE WHAT'S CONTAIN IN THOSE THOUGHTS IS DISTURBING OK THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT GIVES US TWO ANSWERES TO THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE HIGHLY DIVERGEN ONE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF HOW TO ABSTAIN FROM INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS YOU THOUGHTS THAT WERE ADDICTED TO IS IF THOSE THOUGHTS ARE MERELLY ON LOOP ALL THE TIME AND WE CAN'T STOP THEM BUT THE THOUGHTS THEMSELVES AREN'T PARTICULARLY DISTURBING SO THINK ABOUT A SONG YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF YOUR HEAD OR YOU KEEP RECOUNTING SOME EVENT BUT THE EVENT ITSELF ISN'T VERY DISTURBING IT'S JUST INTRUSIVE BECAUSE IT'S THERE WELL IN THAT CASE THE DATE OF REALLY POINT TO TRYING TO ANCHOR YOUR THOUGHTS TO SOME EXTERNAL STIMULU SO GETTING INTO ACTION GETTING INTO ACTIVITIES THAT REALLY DRAW YOUR ATTENTION AWAY FROM THAT THOUGHT NOW YOU MAY STILL HEAR IT SCROLLING IN THE BACKGROUNDS YOU MIGHT BE SITTING IN CLASS STILL HEARING THAT LOOP OF THOU GHTS IN THE BACKGROUND THAT SOMETHING THAT OVER TIME OGHT TO WAIN IT OUGHT TO DISAPPEAR IF WE TRYING BRING MORE AND MORE ATTENTION TO WHATEVER IT IS THAT S IN OUR ENVIRONMENT WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE HAPPEN TO BE LEARNING OR DOING PHYSICALLY ET CETERA THINGS LIKE MINDFUL MEDITATION DOING A TEN OR EVEN JUST FIVE MINUTE TO DAY PRACTICE OF SITTING WITH EYES CLOSED ARE LYING DOWN WITH EYES CLOSED AND REALLY FOCUSSING ON ONE'S BREATH FOCSING ONE'S ATTENTION ON THE SOMETIMES CALL THE THIRD EYE CENTER BUT IN PSCIENCE WE'D SAY THE JUST THE REGION RIGHT BEHIND THE FOREHEAD YOU'E DIRECTING YOUR ATTENTION THERE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE FOCUS FOR SINGULAR TOPICS AND CAN IMPROVE MEMORY AND DO A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS AS WELL THOSE ARE DATA FOR DOCTOR WENY SAYS UKIE'S LABIT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SHE WAS A GUEST ON THE PODCAST AS WELL MY LABORATORY IS RUN STUDIIS ON MINEFUL MEDITATION AS WELL SO WHAT YOU REALLY THING TO DO AS LEARN HOW TO FOCUS BETTER ON ONE THING AND BY FOCUSSING ON THAT ONE THING YOU FOCUS OFF THESE REPETTIVE THOUGHTS NOW I HAVE A FEELING THAT THIS QUESTION WAS ASKED AND THAT MANY PEOPLE UPVOTED THIS QUESTION BECAUSE THE ISSUE IS IN TUST THOUGHTS THAT ARE INTRUSIVE BECAUSE THEY'RE THERE AND ON REFEAT BUT BECAUSE THE THOUGHTS THEMSELVES ARE ACTUALLY TROUBLING THIS COULD BE RECOUNTING A TRAMA SOME ONE HARMED YOU YOU OBSERVE SOMETHING THAT WAS DISTURBING O YOU FELT WRONG O YOU FELT SOME ONE ELSE WAS WRONGED ON YOU CAN'T SEEM TO GET YOUR MIND OFF OF SOMETHING AND YOUR EMOTIONS TEND TO FOLLOW AND SO IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE I'VE A FEELING THIS IS THAT THE ROUT OF THE QUESTION IN THAT CASE THE APPROACHES VERY DIFFERENT WHAT WE KNOW FROM ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE QUALITY SCIENTIFIC AND CLINICAL STUDIES IS THAT THOSE SORTS OF INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS ARE VERY MUCH LIKE A TRAMA NOW WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR IN DEFINDING WHAT TRAMA IS I'LL USE THE DEFINITION THE DOCTOR PAULCONTI ANOTHER INCREDIBLE GUESTS THAT WAS ON OUR PODCAST A PSYCHIATRIST STAMFORD HARVARTRAIN PSYCHITRIS I THINK ONE OF THE WORLD'S FOREMOST LEADERS ON THE ISSUE OF TRAMAN PSYCHITRIAND PSYCHOLOGY GENERALLY HE DEFINES TRAMA AS IN EVENT WERE SOMETHING THAT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES THE WAY THAT YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM WORKS SUCH THAT YOU FUNCTION LESS ADAPTIVELY GOING FORWARD FROM THAT EVENT CI SO NOT EVERY BAD OCCURRENCE IN YOUR LIFE IS A TRAMA THAT'S GOOD NEWS THE BAD NEWS IS MANY PEOPLE HAVE TRAMAS AND TRAMAS CHANGE THE WAY THAT OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM WORK SO THAT WE DON'T FUNCTION AS WELL AS WE COULD SO IN THAT SENSE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS THAT ARE DISTURBING ARE IN MANY WAYS TRAMAS AND ARE REENFORCING THAT TRAMA NOW WE KNOW THAT ALMOST COUNTER INTUITIVELY IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH TRAMA YOU HAVE TO GET VERY CLOSE TO THAT TRAMA YOU DON'T HAVE TO RE EXPOSE AND I WOULD HOPE YOU WOULD NOT REEXPOSE YOURSELF TO THE VERY SAME TRAMA BUT WE KNOW THAT ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO DEAL WITH TRAMAS IS TO GET VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE NARRATIVE AROUND THOSE TRAMAS NOW THIS CAN BE DONE WITH A THERAPIST IDEALLY BUT NOT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO THERAPIER CAN AFFORD THERAPY THERE'S A RANGE OF QUALITY OTHERAPIS FOR THAT MATTER SO ORE LWAYS REFERRING TO THE DESIRE FOR PEALE DO GREAT THERAPY WITH REALLY GREAT MEANING EXCELLENTLY TRAINED PEOPLE BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT IF YOU WANT TO EXTINGUISH AN INTRUSIVE THOUGHT ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO DO THAT IS TO JOURNAL ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR THOUGHT EXTENSIVELY SO RATHER THAN THE EARLIER STRATEGY FOR INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS WHERE THEY'RE JUST ON LOOP AND INTRUSIVE BECAUSE THEY'RE ON LOOP AND PRESENT BUT THEIR CONTENT ISN'T DISTURBING WHEN A THOUGHT IS DISTURBING AND INTRUSIVE WE KNOW THAT IT'S VERY USEFUL TO SCRIPET OUT AS MUCH DETAIL ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR THOUGHT AND THE THINGS AROUND IT AS POSSIBLE I VEU SEE YOU WANT TO DO THIS IN A WAY THAT IS FAIRLY STRUCTURE TO I DEALLY WOULD USE COMPLETE SENTENCES SO THE REASON FOR DOING THAT IS THAT THOUGHTS AS I MENTION EARLIER CAN OFTEN BE FRAGMENTARY SO THAT THEY POP UP IN OUR MIND ALMOST WE SEEMINGLY SPONTANEOUSLY THER THEY INHIBITING OUR ABILITY TO FOCUS OR BE PRESENT TO WORK OR FAMILY OR OTHER THINGS OR SLEEP WRITING THINGS DOWN IN A LOT OF DETAIL DOES SEEM TO HAVE THIS QUALITY OF BOTH REDUCING THE EMOTIONAL LOAD OF WHATEVER IT IS THAT THAT THOUGHT IS ABOUT AS WELL AS DIMINISHING THE FREQUENCY OF THOSE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS OVER TIME SO THIS IS FAR AND AWAY DIFFERENT THAN THE STRATGY I MENTION FOR THE OTHER TYPES OF INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS AND REALLY IT'S FAR AND AWAY DIFFERENT FROM THE THIRTY DAY ABSTINENCE APPROACH THAT DOCTOR ON ALEMKY WAS TALKING ABOUT FOR SUBSTANCE OR BEHAVIOURA ADDICTIONS NOW OF COURSE THIS PROCESS OF ABSTAINING FROM THOUGHTS OR REMOVING THE ADDICTIVE NATURE OF CERTAIN THOUGHTS CAN DEFINITELY TAKE SOME TIME SO GOOD EXAMPLE THERE WOULD BE SUPERSTITIONS Y I'LL COME CLEAN HERE ANDI'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE ON A FEW PODCASTS THAT WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE I DEVELOPED A SORT OF A NOK ON WOULD SUPERSTITION A MANY TIME I'D SAY SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO HAPPEN OR DID WANT T APPENITS A KNOCK ON WOODN'T I KNOCK ON WOOD AND THEN I STARTED AM SUPPRESSING THE BEHAVIOR MOST WEKES  WASLE EMBARRASSING AND THEN I STARTED JUST TELLING MYSELF IN MY HEAD KNOCK ON WOULD KNOCK I WOULD KNOCK ID AND IS CLEARLY A LOTWL BIT OF AN OS D TIPE THING BUT AGAIN O C D IN ER QUOTES HERE OM I THINK IT QUALIFIED AS OSC D IN THE SENSE THAT THE MORE I DID IT THE MORE I WANTED TO DO IT SO I NEEDED TO GOLD COLD TURKEY ON THE THINKING BUT HOW CAN YOU GO CUL TURKEY ON A THOUGHT YOU COULDN'T WHAT I WAS TOLD TO DO AND WHAT WORKED VERY WELL FOR ME WAS TO JUST RIGHT DOWN THE WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME THAT I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT SO TO REALLY GET CLOSE TO THE NATURE OR THE UNDERLYING BASIS OF THAT INTRUSIVE THOUGHT AND I RAISE THIS BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES THE INTRUSIVE THOUGHT IS NOT OKA I'M THINKING ABOUT A CAR ACENOR I M THINKING ABOUT A BREAK UP OR I'M THINKING ABOUT AN EXAMINE THAT I HAVE THAT CAN BE INTRUSIVE BUT A LOT OF TIMES IT'S SOME KIND OF UN NEBULS ABSTRACT SET OF WORDS OR IDEAS OR IMAGES AROUND SOMETHING THAT HAPPEN THAT WE SAW OR HEARD OR EXPERIENCED AND BY PUTTING A LOT OF CLEAR STRUCTURE TO WHAT THE THOUGHT IS EXACTLY AND TO PUTTING SOME THOUGHT AND STRUCTURE ON TO PAPER ABOUT WHAT THAT PATTERN OF NOT HEALTHY THINKING RELATES TO PEOPLE OFTEN ACHIEVE TREMENDOUS RELIEF IN A FAIRLY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIMES SOMETIMES JUST IN ONE SECTION OF WRITING IT DOWN SOMETIMES THEYNG TO WRITE IT DOWN MULTIBLE TIMES WHAT YOU'RE SENTIALLY TRINE TO DO WITH A INTRUSIVE THOUGHT OR A TRAMA OF ANY KIND IS YOUR TRIME TO TURN A DISTURBING STORY THAT IS A STORY THAT OV VOKES A LOT OF EMOTION AND CAPTURES IT CAN HYJACTS YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM INTO WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A KNOWN BUT REPETITIVE AND ANOLD BORING STORY WHERE THE EMOTIONAL LOAD HAS BEEN DEPLEEDED AND THERE OF COURSE I HAVE TO HIGH LIKE THE FACT THAT GETTING SUFFICIENT RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP WE ALSO KNOW IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR REMOVING THE EMOTIONAL LOAD OF TRAMATIC EXPERIENCES AND INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS SO YOU REALLY WANT TO STRIVE TO GET THE BEST POSSIBLE SLEEP YOU CAN THAT INCLUDES SUFFICIENT RAPIN I MOVEMENT SLEEP AND WE HAVE MULTIPLES OUROCOSS RESOURCES FOR THAT AT HURMELABDACOM WE HAVE THE EPISODE ON MASTER YOUR SLEEP WE HAVE THE EPISODE ON PERFECT YOUR SLEEP WE HAVE THE TOOLL KEPT FOR SLEEP ALL OF WHICH ARE TIME STAMPED AND ALL OF WHICH CAN BE ACCESS TO COMPLETE LHESE YOUR COST TO TRYING GET YOUR SLEEP OM AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE INCLUDING LOTS OF RAPIN IYE MOVEMENT SLEEP SO IN ORDER TO REMOVE INTRUSIVE AND ADDICTIVE THOUGHTS ASK YOURSELF IS THIS OS D OF THE CLASSIC SENSE IF IT IS YOU SHOULD SEE A SECATRUST THEY WON'T NECESSARILY PRESCRIBE MEDICATION BUT THERE ARE TOOLS FOR TRUE OS D THAT THAT ARE VERY EFFECTIVE IN MANY CASES AND WE DID THE EPISODE ON OS D WHICH I INVITE YOU TO TO LISTEN TO A WELL YOU WANT TO ASK YOURSELF OR THE THOUGHTS DISTURBING OR MERELY INTRUSIVE AND REPETITIVE IF THEY'RE MERELY INTRUSIVE AND REPETITIVE WELL THEN LEARNING TO FOCUSS YOUR ATTENTION ON OTHER THINGS AND GETTING BETTER AT FOCUSING ON SINGLE THINGS THROUGH AN EXERCISE LIKE MINDFULNESS MEDITATION CAN RALLY HELP AND INDEED TH PERHAPS THE BEST USE OF MINDFULNESS MEDITATION IS TO IMPROVE YOUR LEVEL OF FOCUS IT DOES HAVE OTHER BENEFITS AS WELL BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE THE MAJOR ONE THAT ONE WILL EXPERIENCE EVEN WITH THESE VERY SHORT FIVE OR TEN MENIDAY MEDITATIONS GREAT DATE ON THAT FROM THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AND THEN IF THOSE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS ARE NOT ONLY INTRUSIVE BUT THEY'RE ALSO DISTURBING IN THAT CASE YOU REALLY WANT TO PUT AS MUCH STRUCTURE AND THOUGHT BELIEVE OR NOT INTO WHAT THOSE THOUGHTS ARE REALLY ABOUT WRITE THEM OUT ON PAPER IN COMPLETE SENTENCES AND MAYBE DO THAT MULTIPLE TIMES UN TILL THE UNDERLYING EMOTIONS RELATED TO THOSE THOUGHTS REALLY START TO DIMINISH AND BY DOING THAT YOUR ESSENTIALLY DOING YOUR OWN FORM OF TRAMATHERAPY FOR LACK OF A BETTER WAY TO PUT IT AND AGAIN THE DATO REALLY POINT TO THE FACT TH GETTING CLOSE TO THE SPECIFIC DETAILS AROUND THOSE INTRUESIVE THOUGHTS IS GOING TO BE THE BEST WAY TO EXTINGUISH THE THANK YOU REJOINING FOR THE BEGINNING OF THIS ASK ME ANYTHING EPISODE TO HEAR THE FULL EPISODE AND TO HEAR FUTURE EPISODES OF

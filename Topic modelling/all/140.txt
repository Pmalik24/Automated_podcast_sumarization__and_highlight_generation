VICTING BIDIN FRUM THE WHITE HOUSE NOW AGAIN ONE OF THE PROBENCE HERE IS THAT THE ARGUMENTS THAT TUM TRUMP IS GOING SPENT ALL THAT MONEY ON IVICTING BIDND FROM THE WHITE HOUSE IGNORES THE FACT THAT EXTRAORDINARY MOUNTS OF THE MONEY THAT IS PORT INTO TRUMPS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN SPENT ON HIS LEGAL BILLS AND WE'LL GOING FORWARD WE SPENT ON HIS LEGAL BILLS PARTICULARLY IF ALL OF HIS ASSETS ARE LOCKED UP IN NEW YORK BECAUSE OF THIS FRAUD CASE MEANWHILE PRESIDEN TRUMP IS IS DOING THE TRUMP THING HE DID THIS U A W SPEECH OF THE OTHER DAY THAT WAS NOT TO THE U A S ABOUTA W AND DOM A STAGE CRAFT E WHO CALLED STAGE CRAFTY GIRLS CALL IT FIBBING SO PRESIDENT TRUMP STACKED THE ROOM APPARENTLY WITHTHE BUNCH OF HIS OWN SUPPORTERS MANY OF WHOM ERE NOT UNION MEMBERS IN FACT THERE IS ONE PERSON CARRYING A SCIN THETS AT UNION MEMBERS FOR STR FOR TRUMP WHO THEN ADMIDE TO THE RESS THT HE WAS NOT IN FACT A UNION MEMBER AND HAD BASICALLY BEN HANDED THE SON ACCORDING TO THE UCHIGARDIAN WENS ONAL TRUMP GAVE A SPEECH IN MICHINGAN ON WEDNESDAY SEEKING TO CAPITALIZED ON THE U A W STRIKE AT LEASE TWO CROWD MEMBERS HOLDING SCIENCE AND UNION MEMBERS FOR TRUMP AND AUTO WORKERS FOR TRUMP TURNED OUT TO BE NEITHER ACCORDING TO THE TROY NEWS ONE INDIVIDUAL IN THE CROWD WHO HELD THE SCIGNTHNTS AT UNION MEMBERS FOR TRUMPIC KNOWLEDGE SHE WAS NOT A UNION MEMBER WHEN A PROACHED BY REPORTER AFTER THE EVENT ANOTHER

DESERVED MORE AND HW THEY'RE BEING SCREWED BY PRESIDENT BY NAGAIN THE GENERAL MESSAGE THE TRUMP GAVE WITH REGARD TO BIDIN AND ELECTRIC VEHICL MANDATESIN ALLTHE REST A LOT OF THAT IS TRUE HOWEVER AGAIN THE MANIPULATION OF THE STAGE CRAFT IS PRETTY WILD IS PRETTY WILD WELL DONAL TRUMPS LAWYERS MEANWHILES WE SAY THEY'RE LOOKING DOWN THE BARREL OF A REAL PROBLEM FOR DONAL TRUMP WITH REGARD TO HIS ASSETS O PEOPLE I THINK ARE NOT SPENDIG ENOUGH TIME ANO ENERGY ON THE FRAUD RULING IN NEW YORK THE REACON BEING AGAIN ALL THESE CRUMINAL INDIHTEMENTS THE'REGN TO GO WHICHEVER WAY THE'RE GOING TO GO AND EVERYBODY KNOWS HAT THEYRE POLITICALLY MOTIVEIT OF THE FRAUD RULING IS ALSO POLITICLLY MOTIVATED BUT THE REAL WORLD IMPACTS THAT FRAUD RULING IS DEVASTATING TO PRESIDENT TRUMP ON A PERSONAL AND A FAMILIAL LEVEL PRESIDEN TRUMPS LAWYERS APPARENTLY DON'T REARLY KNOW WHAT TO DO BE CAUSE THE JUDGE IN THIS CASE IS SO OBVIOUSLY PARSON AND SO OBVIOUSLY OVER THE TOP THE JUDGE UCSHE FINED  TRUMPS LAWYERS FOR MAKING ARGUMENTS HE DIDN'T LIKE IN THAT LAST RULING ACCORDING TO THE NEROR TIMES TRUMP COULD LOOSE HIS GRIP ON BUILDINGS INCLUDING TRUMP TOWER ON FIFTH AVENUE THE TRUMPENTERNATIONAL HOTEL LOOKING OVERLOOKING CENTRAL PARK AND ALL THE REST THE JUDGE CIDED WITH NEW YORK ATRING GENERAL LATITIA JAMES AND AS A PUNISHMENT THE JUDGE EFFECTIVELY REVOKED TRUMPSLACENCES TO OPERATE ALL OF THOSE PROPERTIES AND IT LEFT MUCH OF HIS NEW YORK OPERATION HANGING IN THE BALANCE TRUMP IS EXPECTED TO APPEAL HE'S ALREADY SUED  JUST  JUSTICE ANGERON HIMSELF WHO'S BEN A THOREIN IN THE SIDE OF THE TRUMP LWAWYERS FOR MORE THAN YEAR IN WEDNESDAY HEARING TRUMPS LAYERS PLED FOR CLARITY ASKING JUSTICE AN GRON TO EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT THE EFFECT OF HIS RULING WOULD BE AND THE JUDGE REFUSE TO SAY SO IT'S IT'S TOTALLY ON CLEAR WHAT HAPPENS NOW SO IT COULD SPELL THE END OF THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION IT COULD THE FORT FORCE TO SELL OFF OF SEVERAL PROPERTIES IT COULDN' BASELY DESTROYD TRUMPS ORGANIZATION IN NEW YORK MORE LIKELY SIPLEGAL EXPERTS IS SA PERIOR IN WHICH TRUMP WOULD BE UNABLE TO OPERATE HUS PROPETIES WHICH WOULD BE HANDED SO QUORT APPOINT TO CHIEF EXECUTIVE SUCH AN ARRANGEMEN WOULD PRESERVE TRUMPS OWNERSHIP WHILE PREVENTING HIM AN HIS TWOODON'T SONS FROM RUNNING THE MACHINERY OF THEIR UMPIE WITHOUT PERMISSION FRUM THE CORT WHICH COULD BE A PROBLEM DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH LEVERAGE HE IS TAKING OUT AGAINST BUILDINGS FOR EXAMPLE IN ORDER TO FUN HIS HIS LEGAL ENTERPRISES AN ALL THESE ARE OBSTACLES TO TO TRUMPS REELECT AGAIN IT IS NOT THE TRUMP CAMP BE BITON HE'S CERTAINLY CN IS THAT A PROBABILITY I THIAN'S NOT A PROBABILITY I THINK THAT IT IS EHT I WOULD SAY A FORTY TO FORTY FIVE PER CENT SHOT THAT TRUMP WOULD BEAT JOBIDON IN I GENERAL ELECTION GIVEN HIS PERFORMANCE IN THE LAST TELESHIN GIVEN THE FACT THAT RIGHT NOW HE'S NOT THE ACTURAL MOMINE YAT UNTI MANY DEMOCRATS OUR FOCUSSING IN ON THE FAILURES OF JOBIDON RATHER THAN HOW MUCH THEY HATE DONAL TRUMP OBVIOUSLY JOBIDON IS FOCUSSING IN IN TREMENDOUS FASHION ON TRUMP AND TRUMP ALONE A HE THE ONLY REASON BASIDLY THAT HE STATE IN THE RACE IS BECAUSE TRUMP IS DENOMINATE HE BELIEVES THAT HE'S THE ONLY CANDIDATE THAT HE CAN

SCRUM FIGHTING EACH OTHER WELL FINALLY RONDO SANTIS IS ECTRA TRAINTING HIS FIRE ON TRUMP AND THIS HAS BEEN   THE SORT OF PATTERN WHEN IT COMES TO PRIMARIES WITH TRUMP GOING ALL WAY BACK TO TWENTY SIXTEEN HOEU GO BACK TO TWENTY SIXTEEN WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS THAT TED CRUWS AN MARKO RUBIO OR UNDER THE WEIRD ASSUMPTION THAT DONALD TRUMP SUPPORT BASE WOULD SIMPLY COLLAPSE AT A CERTAIN POINT AND THEN THEY WOULD JUST WALK INTO THE NOMINATION THAT OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T HAPPEN INSTEAD THEY INIT UP FIGHTIN EACH OTHER TO THE END AND THEN CON CASIC STATE IN TO MAKE SURE THE DONALD TRUMP WAS THE NOMINATE BY STUCKING UP LIKE TEN FIFTEEN PER CENT OF TE VOTE IN COMPETITIVE PRIMARIES AND SO DONAL TRUMP WALTZ TO THE NOMINATION DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE EARLY STATES HE'S ONLY WHENING THIRTY THIRTY FIVE PERCENT O OT AND WELL TO DAY  TRUMP IS A LOT STRONGER THANE WASN'T TWENTY SIXTEEN AND HE'SBEN A SITTING PRESIDENT BEFORE A HUGE PER SENTER OF BAS IS ABSOLUTELY ADDICTED TO PRESIDEN TRUMP THE LOVE THE GUY AND SO WHOEVER IS RUNNING AGAINST TRUMP AT A CERTAIN POINT HERE IS GOING TO HAVE TO STOP WIT THIS NOTION THAT TRUMP IS GOING TO JUST FALL OFF THE ROAD SOMEWHERE HE'S NOT SOMEMONS GON TO HAVE TO TAKE HIM ON DIRECTLY WHEN THE ONLY PERSON RIGHT NOW HIS POSITION TO DO THAT IS THT WHO'S NUMBER TWO IN THE RACE RON TO SANTIS AND DESANTIS FOR ALL THE SLINGSON ARROWS THAT HE'S TAKEN IS BASICALLY IN THE POLES WHERE HE'S BEEN FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS HE IS HIS STUCK IN THE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE PER CENT RAGE HE IS IN IN A SECOND PLACE HOLDING CATTERN AND SO SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE AND SO FINALLY DESANSIS WHO HAS NOW DONE TWO SEPARATE DEBATES WITH THE REST OF THE WITH THE REST OF THE SECOND HER REPUBLICANS HE'S BEGINNING TO FIGHT BACK BECAUSE HE'S MAN AN ARGUMENT THE ARGUMENT BASICLLY ISLE I I I ON THE LAST TO DEBATES AND THE ONLY OTHER SOLY CANDIDATE AND HE ONLY I WHO'S RUNNING DOUBLE DIGETS EVEN AGAINST TRUMP IN THESE PRIMARIES SO THREIN A CONSOLIDATE TO FIELD DON'T CONSOLITATE FEELD ROUND ONE CANDIDATE WHO HAS NOT EVEN HAD TO GO THROUGH DEBATE AND WHO HAS A LOT OF BLEMISHIS ON HIS RECORD AND SAID WHY NOT CONSOLIDATE THE FIELD AROUND TWO CANDIDATES AND THEN LET US BATTLE IT OUT AND TEN A TRUMP LWINS TRUMP WINDS BY THE WAY THAT THAT IS WHAT THE THE POLES ARE SHOWING THE THA THE POS ARE SHOWING THAT PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THE DSANSIS ONE LAST TOATE FOR EXAMBLE SE AN AN FOCUS SCRUP CAME OUT YESTERDAY AND AT SN AN FOCUS GROUP SUGGESTED THAT DE SANSUS WAS BIG WINER O THEBATE TO ES NO TE YOT O BUT LORD WHO YOU THINK TI BEST DERING THIS DEBATE ALL OF YOU PURGER WELL CHRISTY CASE HIS TOIS TON

CHRIS CRISTY TIMS GOT BASELY DID NOUT REGISTER PEOPLE HATED MY PENSIL PERFORMANCE NOBODY UNDERSTANDS MY DUG BURGAM AS ON THE STATE SO DE SANSIS IS NOW MAKING THE CASE THAT HE SHOULD HVE MADE A LONG TIME AGO WHICH IS WHEN IT COMES TO WINNING THE THE GENERAL ELECTION I'M YOUR GUY I'VE HAVE THE ROVEN TRACK RECORD IN FLORIDA I HAVE NOT LOST TO PRESEN BINE BEFORE WHILE DONAL TRUMP HAS AND DOWNS TRUM HAS TO STOP TOCKING TO BATES I'S BOUT TIME FOR DONALD TRUMP TO ACTUALLY TEBATE ME ANS HE'S NOW CALLING FOR ONE ON ONE'S BATE WITH TRUMP DIRECTLYE HERE WAS DE SANCI YASTERY GAING A LOT MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH TRUMP HE'S HAD A LOK TO SAY ABOUT ME ON SO SHOW METY O REALLY SENCE TWNTY TWENTY TWO RIGHT BEFORE THE MID TERM ELECTION HE STARTED OUT HE STARTED ATTACKING ME WHEN I WAS WA WE ALL REPUBLICANS

CHOICE THAT THEDESER NOW IS TRUMPET ACTUALLY GOING TO DO THAT OF COURSE NOT TRUMP IS NOT WHENG THAT AND THAT THAT SHOULD RAISE SOME QUESTIONS IF TRUMP IS UNABLE TO DEBATE RON TO SANTIS WHO IS IN EXCELLENT REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR FROM FLORIDA AND WHO IS THE SECOND PLACE FINISHER IN IN ALL OF THESE POLES RIGHT NOW AND BY THE WAY WHO ACTUALLY IS A THREAT TO HIM AND IWA I KNOW THAT EVERYBODY IS WRIGHTING OFF TO SANTIS OVER ALL RIGHT NOW BUT THE REALITY IS THAT TE SANSIS HAS DONE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF GROUNDWORK AND I WHALE RIGHT NOW TO SANSIS IS RUNNING BY THE LATYS HE GUESS NEWS POLT IN THE

MUCH IN OPEN QUESTION THERE'S A WORLD WERE TO SANCES WINS IWA AND SO IF IF TRUMP JUST KEEPS IGNORING IT DI SANSIS MEN IT A CERTAIN WOIN SOME HE'S GETTIOG HAFE TO TAKE IT TO TRUMP AND  SANSIS S GIN TO HAVE TO BE THE GOT WHO DOES IT BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE IN THE FIELD REALLY IS CAPABLE OF DOING IT THAT BIG PROBLEM HERE IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT CONSOLIDATION THE FIELD TRUMP ONCE THE FIELD TO CONSOLIATE TO JUST HIM I THAIN'TS PRE MATURE TO DO THAT CONSIDERING AGAIN ALL OF HIS VULNERABILITIES THAT WE'VE DIS CUSSED RANGING FROM THE FACT THAT HE IS WILDLY UNPOPULAR WITH SUBURBAN WOMEN TO THE FACT THAT HE ALREADY LOST TO JOBIDAN THE FIRST TIME TO THE FACT THAT HE DOES NOT HAVE THE SELF CONTROL TO ACTUALLY METICULOUSLY ATTACK JOBIDON'S RECOR AND ALL THE THINGS WE ALL KNOW ABOUT DONAL TRUMP THOSE SHOULD BE FAIR GAME FOR DEBATE BUT CONSOLITING THE FIELD TO TWO IS NECESSARY AT THE PONT IF YOU ACTUL WANT THERE TO BE ANY SORT OF RACE INSTEAD WITH MUNCH OF ALSO RANS WOR STAYING IN THE FIELD

INQUIRY YOU EXONERATE THE GUI AND THE QUESTION IS GOIN TO BE WHATHYEU HAVE ENOUGH VOTES EVEN ON THE REPUBLICANSIDE OF THE OUT FOR AN ACTUAL IMPEACHMENT THAT MEANS HOLDING TOGETHER YOUR CAUCAS IN REALLY STRONG FASHION WHIC IS KIND OF A PROBLEM SINCE AGAIN THE IM PEACHMENT NQUIRY WAS LAUNCHED WITHOUT A VOTE IN THE HOUSE MEANING THET THE THE MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE THE REPUBLICAN HWOR WHO'S NOT EVEN THERE AND THAT THE FACT IS THAT THAT MC CARTHY COULD NOT GET ENOUGH PUBLICANS TO VOTE ON THE DOTTED LINE WITH AR ARD TOIN M PEACHMEN INCRY TO LAUNCH AT THAT WAY WHICH RAISE THE QUESTION AST WHETHER HE'SGING TOGET ENOUGH FRE PUBLICANS TO BOT FOR AN ACTUAL IN PEACHMEN WHIC YOULD BE A GIAN FAIL IF YOU LAUNCH AN INQUIRY WITHOUT COMING TO AN ACTUOAL I PEACHMEN YOU GET NOTHING OUT OF IT SO THE REPUBLICANS DID IT ANYWAY THEY LAUNCH THE IMPEACHMEN NQUIRY WOD PEOPLE THINK THAT THAT WAS AN ATTEMPT BY MACCARTHY TO STAVE OFF THE RIGHT FLANK SANGLESS I'M GIVING YOU GUIS WHAT YOU WANT GOT THE IM

DON'T WAIT MAKE THE SWITCH TO DAY GET YOURS A GERMY'S RAZORS ATDOD COM MEANWHILE ON THE RIGHT A FASCINATING DEBATE HAS BROKEN OUT ABOUT THE VALUE OF MARRIAGE IT'S WHIT'S REALLY INTERESTING S THAT THEY'RE BUNCH PEOPLE ON THE SHO CALLED RED PILLED RIGED WHO HAVE NOW SUGGESTED THAT MARRIAGE IS BAD FOR MEN THAT MEN SHOULD NOT GET MARRIED NOW THE CASE THAT THEY'RE MAKING IS NOT THE LIBERAL FEMINIST CASE THAT BASELY MEN ARE USELESS AND TERRIBLE ON WOMANEAS MAN LIKE A FISHNEANS BY SCHOOL OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THE CASE THAT THEY ARE MAKING IS THAT THE STAKES OF MARRIAGE HAVE BEEN CHANGED BY THINGS LIKE NO FAULT DIVORCE CUSTODY ARRANGEMENTS THE IS CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS AND AL THE REST FOUSIL SUPPORT THE BASELY THE LEGAL REGIMEN HAS MADE IT NOT A BARGAIN FOR MEN TO GET MARRIED NOW I AGREE WITH WITH THE CRETIQUE OF ALL THOSE POSSYAN IN NO FAULT DIVORCE IS A DISASTR AREA I THINK THAT THE CHILD CUSTODY ARRANGEMENTS THAT THAT BASELY ALWAYS GO TO MOM NO MATTER WHAT THAT IS IT THAT IS A SERIOUS PROB WHEN YOU SHIFT THE INSENSIVE STRUCTURE THERE'S REASON WHY THE MAJORITY OF DIVORCE OF THE VAST MASURYS IVORCES ARE NOW INITIATED BY WOMEN THAT THAT IS NOT BECAUSE IN THE PAST WOMEN WORTWORD WILDLY ABUSED AND TODAY THEY ARE WILDLY LIBERATED BUT THAT REALLY IS WHEN YOU SHIFTHE INSENSIVE STRUCTUON AND TURNS OUT THAT ALL THE RISK IS NOW TAKEN BY MEN WOMEN ARE GOUN BE THE ONES WHO ACTUALLY ACTIV ATE AND PUSH THAT DIVORCE BUTTON HOWEVER THE RED KILLED HAVE TAKEN IT ONE STEP FURTHER AND NOW THEYRE TELLING YOUNG MEN YOU SHOULD NOT GET MARRED IT'S TOO DANGEROUS TO GET MARRIED DON'T GET MARRIED THAT FOOLISH THAT'S WHAT SOU LET'S LET'S GO THROUGH SOME OF THESE ARGUMENTS BEAUSE THEY BECOME VERY POPULAR ON THE RIGHT SO BUT START WITH PEARL DVES SOR PEARL DAVIS IS AN ANTI FEMINIST WHO HAS A BECOME PETTY POPULARS AS LOD PEOPLE LABEL HER SORT OF A FEMALE AND RETATE T WITHOUT THE AD CHECKERED PAST AND THA HERE IS PEARL DAVIS TALKING ABOUT MARRIAGE THER TRAD CONDAILY WIRE CONSERVATIVE WHER AR SAYING THAT PEARLS JUST THE DEMAN GLOOMER WHO LIES ABOUT TAT JUST BOK IS AS ON THE NEGATIVE NEVER THE POSITIVES AND ALL THE MEN COMPLAINING AR JUST CRIME AND SO ONE DAY HE COMES HOM AND HE FIN THO THAT HD WHY HAV CALLED THE POLICE ON HIM AND TOLD THEM THAT THE FIRST TIME THEY HOK O TEN YEARS AGO HE OM HE HAD CAUGHT AN CORATER AND THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS WHEN A MAN HAS TOLD HER THEY'RE NOT HIS KIT A MAN HAS NO WAY TO HAVE TILLDRE AND THOSH CANTO BE ACTUALLY HITE THEY'RE ALWAYS HERT BECAUS THE COURT GIVE F THE WOMEN COSTIDY NINETY PER CENT OF THE TIME AND REC MATTER REALLY THE ONLY ONT THAT OF THE MONEY TO FIGHT IT AND THE TIME SO I I AFT THE DAILY WIRE TERMY BOWING BOT WALS OM ARE IF THAT'S JUST CRI BABY THEY JUST ARE THEY JUST THER CRY THEY BE WE MAN WHO DON'T MAN OP AN WANT TO RI THO TO ET O THE THEN ETHING BECAS TAN THAT M TEMANDING THAT THE LAWT TAN AN DEMAN AN WOMEN THEY THREE PRECOSSAN FOR DOING THE TO YOU GO TEMAN THAT MAD NEE TO TAP O AN TAKE PART IN TE THI TEM THAT TE SCRIMINATE THEGN THEM YOU THE FIND TO GOL THAT PRICE YOU WON'T DO IT BUT AN I HAVE THE THOUGHT TOO I TELL I FOUND A MUSLING GIRL TEYDED THE TAME THING  FOUND A CRISTIN GIRL THAT TI THE THIN TY AE O TO CHA TE G THEY TAPPEN AN ALL OVER WHETHER YOU WANTA BEWEVET OT IT  HAPPENING I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR REWI THEN I DON'T CARE ABOUT YO TURT THE HAPPEN EVERYWHERE O CASE SO THE ARGUMENT THAT YHU'S MANG AGAINST IT ALL THESE MARITAL POLICIES THOSE THAT THOSE ARE CORRECT TO ARGUMENTS AND NOBODY IS DISREGARDING THE PAIN OF MEN WHO HAVE BEEN WRONG FULLY VICTIMIZE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE INSENSIF STRUCTURE IS COMPLETELY STACT AGAINST THEM THAT IS TRUE HOWEVER THE BENEFITS OF MARRIAGE ARE STILL UNBELIEVABLE IT DOES MATTER FOR YOU MARRI TO PRETEND THAT THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PERSON THE AMARI THAT IS HAPPENING WITH CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS AND AND TO ALL THE SAME THAT STATISTICALLY UNTRUE THERES THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO MITIGATE AGAINST THE RISK OF DIVORCE AND THE PERSON TH YOU MARRY IS THE CHIEF MITIGATION TTHE TRUTH IS THAT N THE JEWISH COMMUNITY WE ALWAYS HAVE A BACK UP LAN IN THE SENSE THAT EVERY MRITAL CONTRACT IS A PREENE UP EVERY MARITAL CONTRACT S PRN UP RADID Y A JEWRISH CA TO BU IS A PREINE UP IT GUARANTEES AT CERTAIN LEVELS OF SPOUSIL SUPPORT FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU IF YOU GIVE AT GET THEN IT IT IT MAKES PRIOR ARRANGEMENTS AND ALL THE REST BUT ONEOF THAT THE THROWING OUT TO BIG WITH BATH WATER IS NOT THE SOLUTION SO HOW ABOUT BOTH HW ABOUT WE REVISE THE SYSTEM OF LAW BUT ALSO IN THE MEANTIME YOU DOU NEED TO FIND AS POUS AND GET MARRIED TO HER AND IF WHAT ARE REQUIRES FOR YOU TO TO FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING THAT IS TO SHIFT AWAY FROM THE STATE MANS ATEED LAW AND TOWARD A CONTRACT ARRANGEMENT THEN THEN DO THAT AS WELL ARE WE CAN HAVE CHURCHES THAT'S PONCE OR THAT SORT OF THING BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS THAT THOSE ARE UNFORCIBLE CONTRACTS AND COURT VERY OFTEN THE CUSTOM PRECUSTOFTHE ARRANGEMENTS AN ALL THE RAT S OF THAT SORT OF THING I WON'T GO THROUGH SOME OFTHE STAFFS WITH REGARD TO THE BENEFITS OF MARIGICTS I THINK THAT IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE TO EXAGGERATE HOW BAD THINGS ARE FOR MEN AS THE MEAN THERE ARE'T REALLY BAD FOR MEN WHO END UP DIVORCED OR THAT WOMEN AREN'T DIVORCY MEN AND INCREDIBLY HIGH RATE OVER ALL OR THE WOMEN ARE INITIATING THE VAST MAJORITY OF AGAIN I AGREE WITH MANY OF THE CRETIUES OF CURENT MARY LAW AGREE THE LOT OF THAT STUFF THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN YOU TAKE IT SO FAR THAT YOU SAY THAT THE SOLUTION FOR MEN IS TO NOT GET MARRIED NOW WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS YOU'VE CREATED A SECOND ORDER OF FACT WE'RE UNMARRIED MEN BECOME ACTUAL MENACES AV THE REALITY IS THAT MEN CHANNEL THERE AGGRESSIVE DRIVES TOWARD BUILDING WOR THEY CHANNELET TOWARE DESTROYING AND A SYSTEM IN WHICH WOMEN ARE UNMARRIED AND MEN ARE UNUNMARRIED THAT SOMETHING THAT THE LEFT WANTS AND IF YOU ACQUIESS IN THAT THEN YOU ACTUALLY END UP DESTROYING T THE VERY FUNDAMENTAL BASES OF SOCIETY THAT ALLOWS FOR THE GROWING AND BUILDING OF SOCIETY BEYOND THE LEFT EST PRINCIPLES  MOT MEN MAY IT MY ANSWER TO PEARL IS BOTH AN BUT YES G T MARRIED AND ALSO WE SHOULD WORK TO CHANGE THOSE LAWS BUT BY THE WAY THE WAY THAT WE DATE HAS IT HASNAN A FACT ON HOW WE GET MARRIED WHO WE GET MARRIED TO AN WHEN I DATED MY WIFE WE WENT IN KNOWING AS WE BEGAN TO DATE THAT WE WEREN'T WE WERE NOT GOING TO SLEEP TOGETHER UNTIL WE WERE MARRIED WE KNEW FOR A FACT THEN WE WERE GOING TO HAVE LONG CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THINGS THE MATTERED AND AND THIS IS BY THE WAY THE THE BEST AVAILABLE DTE A SUGGEST THAT THIS IS HOW YOU ENDED WITH A TANGIBLE DURABLE MARRIAGE THE LAST OF VERY LONG TIME IS IT EVERYBODY HAS TO BE COMMITTED GOING IN THAT VALUE WHEN YOU PUT VALUES OF THE CENTERE OF DATING THAT OBGUSES DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE IMPERVIOUS THE POSSIBILITY OF DIVORCE BUT IT DOES MEAN THER CHANCE OF DIVORCE ARE REALLY A LOT LOWER A LOT LOWER NOW DO ONR RI BUMPRO THERE I DONT THING I AM REBING ONBROLE FRANKLY BUT THAT THERE THEIR BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING SIMILAR CLANS SO FOR EXAMPLE A BRYIN ATLESS WAS ON WHATEVER POD CAST IN AND HERE HE WAS TALKING BOUT MARRIAGE WEG YOU CONFETER A PRENA PREEN UPS ARE REGULARLY THROWN OUT ALL THE TIME THER TYPICALLY NON INFORCIBLE ESPECIALLY THE LONGERAR MARRIAGE GOES ON THE LESS LIKELY THEY ARE TO BE ENFORCED MEN CAN ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED IN MARRIAGE AND IN DIVORCE FINANTIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE KIDS WOMEN  LIKE WITH A CUS TOBY AND THEN ALSO YOU TO GET THE DIVORCE THE FINANCIAL COSTOP JUST GEING THE TURN GETTING ALL THAT IN O IF THER IF IT'S CONTESTE DIVORCE  AND MID FIVE FIGURE SIX FIGURES ON ON A TURNEYS AND YO OTHER PAY FOR HER TURNIN TO FIFTY PER CENT OF MARRIGES AND IN DIVORCE EITY PERCENT OF TIVORCES ARE IN ASH BY WOMEN NIN TO PER CENT OF SHOUS COLLEGE ETICATED NINEY PERCENT OF CHANCIPORT PAYMENTS GO FOR MEN TO WA  NINE TO SEVEN PERSENT OF AMONI PAYMENTS C MEN O WYOU KNOW YOU HAVE NO FAULT T O DEFORS SO WOMAN CAN SHEAT ON YOU DSHE CAN SOK IT H SHA OGET AGAIN ALOT OF WHAT HE SAYING IS TRUTE THIS STATS ON MARRIAGE ARE NOT COMPLETELY DRUNGLED THOUGH THOSE IN JUST ONE SECOND AN THE RIP ON ON THE DIVORCE LAW IS A GOOD RIP IT IS A FINE RIP AND THE ANSWER IS NOT FOR MEN TO AF WOID MARRIAGE THE ANSWERIS FOR MEN TO FIND A GOOD WOMAN TO GET MARRIED TO WHOIS COMMITTED TO VALUE YES OF COURSE MARRIAGEIS AR RISK OF COURSE IT IS AND THAT RISK IS DUST PROPORTIONATELY BORN BY MEN AT THIS POINT THAT IS TRUE ALSO BUT IS THE REWARD WORK THE RISK THE ANSWER IN A HUGE MAJORITY OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE BOTH PEOPLE ARE COMMITTED LEKES A HAV SHARE CHRISTIAN VALLUES FOR EXAMPLE THE RIS THE RISK IS IS WORTH IT IS IS THE BASIF PRINCIPLE AND THE THESE ARGUMENTS ARE MADE NOT JUST BY PEOPLE I VISIT ANDRETATE HAS MADE THE SAME SORTS OF OF ARGUMENTS HERE'S ANDREW TATE TALKING ABOUT MEN DON'T BENEFIT FOR MARRIAGE Y WHIN IT'S A FANTASTIC INVIREMENT AND I THINK AN IDEALISTS TIC WORLD THUS WAY WOULD BE I THINK THE REASON IS NO HAPPING TO DAY AS I DON'T THINK MANY MEN ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM MARRIAGES OR RELATIONSHIPS ANY MORE AND PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO HAP TO TO REQUIRE SOME DEGREE OF AN SENTIVE I THINK THAT WE SET UP THE WORLD NOW AN A WAY WHERE MEN ARE SEEN AS WORKER DROITS THERE EXPECTED TO GO WORK ALL THEY COME HOME CLEAN OFF AS WELL SHARE THE CLEANING WITH THE WOMAN NOT HAVE ANY NOT NO MEAL PRAER PARED FOR NOT HAV ANY AUTHORITY OVER THE HOUSEHOLE AND JUST AND JUST BE A WORKER DROIT AND BE A SAD A I DON'T THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE UNDERS AN THAT MEN ARE INTRINCS ICALLY WIRE TO DESIRE RESPECTS AMONGST OUR PEERS AND IN OUR ENVIRONMENTS THIS IS WHY SEOS WORKS SO HARD BECAUSE THEY GET RESPECT IN THEIR COMP I GATE SO AGAIN I DON'T DISAGREED WITH MUCH WHAT YOU SAY BUT THE SOLUTION VERY OFTEN WITH THE RED PILL CAN A MOVEMENT THE DIAGNOSIS IS CORRECT AND THE SOLUTION IS WRONG THAN THAT THAT HAPPENS VERY VERY OFTEN  IN THIS SORT OF MOVEMENT THAT THE REASON BY THE WAY THAT PEARL AND THE REST OF THE REDPILL MOVEMENT THINK THEWAY THEY USE BECAUSE OF ARGMENTS LIKE ONE THAT DID HA PERSONIN DESTINY MAKES WITH PEARL IN THIS PARTICULAR CLIM MEN OUT EARNING MAN HAVE A HARD TIM RESPECTING THEM MAN THERE WAY THAT'S NOT TRUE THAT'S NOAN IVE HADN' TO THAT DAYTN HE EXPLAINED WHY AT AT A TIME THE WOMEN REPOTED THAT THEY WERE EXPECTED TO BE IN CHARGE OF THE HOUSEOF DUTIES THAT'S THE WECACHOP AND THE ATAK OF A ROPRS THAT A MODERN WOMAN ACTUALLY CURD THAT I'S ALL OUDIMATED NOWADAYS I MENT YOU'VE E WASY RECUTED TI WY GOU A  TA TI    I AA IAS MUCH AS IS   HAV SO DONT DO IT A G  T O  DOO THAT SO THAT'S THE ISSUES THAT AT THE ONE O  O E  OFERTE FOR WAT A AN ASOLUTELY IS I  WA O GAO GET OLDER AND YOU MENAGE A HOUSEHOLD AN YOUR OWN PEARL YOU'LLSEE HOW OKING AN OYATORS WHEN YOU'R WORKING AN THAT YOU COME HOME A A  AV O BORBLE AND NOBODY COLICLYAT AAND YE THE A I AVE HOTALLY VALARIES OF ER DIVORCE OF COURSEIS T ATORS TO BREAK UP AHOME OA  I CAN LIVE THAT A FILL  O O LIK  TO IT E  LIE LONG FRIENDS FROM LIKE GRATSCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL WILL DORMAN COLLEGE AND THAT BHATE EACH OTHER FOR EVER OVER LIKE BAD DORM ROOMMATE EN NO LIGT EN A RELATIONSHIP THAT YOU OF COURSE TI TE TELOGUS IS PERFECTLY VELOP TI THINK I THINK TIT HITTHINK I A NO  AV AS BEEN UP DUTIES IN THE HOUSEHOLDS LIK ON OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF LIKE A RELATIONSHIP ECAUSE IT'S WHERE YOU'RE SPENDING MOST OF TA O THIS WAY I SAY EY WIL GET TRI MO SAY I'M TAN GOUE EVEN DATING ITILL YOU LIVE TOGETHER CAUSE IT DO YOU LIVE TOGETHER YOU'LL REALLY KNOW WIT THE OTHER PERSONS LIKE AND WANCE IS TOR LIV IT OGETHEN YOU SEE WHAT THE HOUSEHOLD DUTIES ARE LIKE THAN YOU GET A FEEL FOR WAT THE RELATIONSHIP IT SO DESTINY IS SAYING HERE IS TOLTALLY GRAZY O GAY THE IDEA THAT YOU GET DIVORCED BUT SEE OF CASE GET DIVORCE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SPLIT UP WHO HANDLES THE DISH WASHER IS NUTS AND COMPARING MARRIAGE TO ROOMATES HOUSERMENTS YES BECAUS YOU ON'T EXPECT TO BE ROOMMATES WITH YOUR ROOMATE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AND HAVE CHILDREN WITH THEM  GENERALLY SPEAKING A MARRIAGE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENT THAT IS PURELY ABOUT WHO SHARES HOUSEHOLD DUTIES IS POSE YOU ABOUT BUILDING A HOUSEL SO IT'S THAT ATTITUDES WER DIVORCE THAT IS MAKING THE RED PILL CRUE THEY SEXANCUN AL THAT'S YOUR VERSION MARRIAGE THAN I'M NOT IN I AGREEVE THAT WERE MY VERSION MARRIAGE I WOULD NOT BE IN THE POINT THAT I'M MAKING IS THAT THAT SHOULDN'T BE ANYBODY'S VERSION OF MARRIAGE JUST LIKE THE CRORN VERSION DVORSION BE ANYBODY'S VERSION OF DIVORCE ND WIN GIV YOU SOME STAFTS THE DEMONSTRATE TID NOT ALL MARRIAGES ARE CREATED EQUAL NOT ALL PREDICATES FOR MARRIAGE ARE THE SAME SO BRAD WELCOCKS WHO IS A SOCIAL SCIENCE SCHOLAR ON ALL THIS HE HAS A BOOK CALLED GET MARRIAGE AND IT'S ALL ABOUT MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE THAN HERE ARE SOME OF THE FACTS IN THABO THERRE WELL SUBSTANTIATED BY BY THE DATA THE NUMBER ONE FACTOR IN PREDICTING A HIGH QUOLITY MARRIAGES PERCEIVE PARTNER COMMANDMENT IF YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR PARTNER IS DEEPLY COMMITTED TO THE MARRIAGE YOU WILL BE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO THE MARRIAGE WHICH IS ONE O THE REASONS WHY IT REALLY MATTERS HIGYO DATE OT REALLY REALLY MATTERS HIYODATE SO I AGREE THAT N A CONTET FOR YOU PICING UP A GIRL IN A BAR AND THN YOU LIVE TOGETHER AN THN GET MARRIED TO HER THAT'S A VERY RISKY SITUATION YOU PUT YOURSELF IN A SITUATION THAT IS VERY RISKY BUT THAT IS NOT HOW I'VE EVER RECOMMENDEDDATING THT IS NOT AVER HOW OF RECOMMENDED GETTING MARRIED ITIS ALL PART OF WHOLISTIC YOU OF HOW MALE FEMALE RELATIONSHIPS WORK IF YOU JUST TAKE MARRIAGE IS AN INSTITUTION AND YOU JUST THROW IT OUT THERE AND HOWEVER YOU DATE IS SUPPOSED TO BE EQUIVALENT THAT OF COURCE IS NOT TROUP WOMEN WHO HAD TEN CHURCH ARE FIFTY PER CENT LESS LIKELY TO DIVORCE FOR EXAMPLES WHEN YOU HEARD PEARL EARLIER TALK ABOUT FOR EXA I'VE SEEN CHRISTIAN WOMEN DIVESEEN MUSLEN YES BUT THE QUESTIONS LIKELIHOOD YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND SO MANY ANY GROUP WHO DOES ACTS WIRES EAT THE QUESTION IS HOW OFTEN DOES THAT HAPPEN HOW YOU MITIGATE YOUR RISK AS FAR AS THESE STAFF THAT FIFTY PER CENT TO MARIAGE S AND A DIVORCE JUST AABOUT FORTY PER CENTS RIGHT NOW OF FIRST MARRIAGE IS HN DIVORCE WHICH S WAIGH WEIGHED TO HIGH TELL SO DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE NINETEEN EGHTIES BUT AGAIN IS NOT EQUIVALENT BETWEEN GROUPS COLLEGE EDUCATED PARENTS RISTKC OF DIVORCE HAS FALLEN BY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PER CENTS SINCE THE INETEEN SEVENTIES AND HERE'S A GOOD STAT ALMOST NINETY PER CENT OF THEIR CHILDREN FOR COLLEGE EDUCATED MARRANTS ARE BEING RAISED IN MARRIED LARGELY INTACK FAMILIES TO DAY SO TURNS OUT THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY A FORMULA TO HIS SUCCESSFUL MARRIAGE IT TENDS TO BE CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS HIGHLY EDUCATED THO THOSE WOULD BE LIKE THE BIGGEST THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO A FACT WHETHER YOU AND UP STAYING MARRIED OR RETH YOU MEND AF DIVORCE BY THEWAY ANOTHER FACTOR THAT ENDS UP DETERMINING WHETHERYOU STAY MARRIED OR AND OF DIVORCE IS AGAIN ABOUT THE NATURE OFTH MARRIAGE DO YOU HAVE KIDS MARRIAGES WITH KIDS DIVORCE FAR LESS OFTEN THAN MARRIAGES WITHOUT KIDS IN FACT THE DIVORCE RATE FOR COUPLES WITH KIDS S ABOUT FORTY PER CENT LOWER THEN TEDIVORCE RATE FOR COUPLES WITHOUTKAT WHICH MAKE CENSE BEU AVE LESS THAN VESSMENT ONCE YO HAVE KIDS THEN ACTUALLY A DAMAGES AT ANOTHER PARTY FOR YOU TO GET DIVORCED OVER THE DISH WASHER AND THEN THEN THEN SOMEBODY ELSE PAYS FOR YOUR CRIMES AT THAT POINT SEVENTY SEVEN PER CENTS OF COLLEGE EDUCATED CON SERVATIVE PARENTS ARE STILL IN THER FIRST MARRIAGE SOR SEVENTY PER CENTS OF MODERATS AND SIXTY IGHT PER CENT OF LIBERALS AND AGAIN THEN THE NUMBER OF NEWLY DIVORCE PEOPLE FOR ONE THOUSAND MARRIED MARICANS IS TO CLINE PRETTY MARICETLY SINCE THE EIGHTIES WHOS TWENTY TWO POINT SIX IN NINETEEN EIGHTY IT IS THIRTEEN POINT SIX TO DAY IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE AS FAR AS THE NOTION THAT IT'S LIKE DAMAGING FINANTIALLY FROR MEN YO GET MARRIED NOTTES IT'S DAMAGING FOR MANY AT DIVORCE IT'S NOT DAMAGING FOR MENTO GET MARIED MARRIED MEN IN THEIR THIRTISERN ABOUT NINETY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IF THEI'RE CO HABITING THERE ABOUT SIX THY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS OF THEIRE SINGLE THANE ABOUT FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS THE AVERAGE MARRAGE PREMIUM IN HOUSEHOLD DOSSETS IS MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A STABLY MARRIED MAN SO AGAIN I THINK WHAT PEOPLEARE ACTUALLY ARGUNG ABOUT OVER HERE TO BE FAIR TO THE RED PILL GROUP I THINK WHIT THEI'R ACTULLY ARGUING ABOUT IS DIVORCE ANDSO THE QUESTION IS ARE YOU MORE LIKELY TO STAY MARRIED OR ARE YOU MORE LIKELY TO END UP IN A DIVORCE SITUATION AND THAT IS A A FAIR QUESTION DEPENDING ON THE PROCESS THAT YOU USE FOR DATING N THE CULTURAL MILU IN WHICH YOU LIVE IN IN THE COMMERIYOR ISLAND D ORTHODOXTIRSH COMMUNITY NOT A LOT DIVORCE IK VERY VERY LOAD OF ORSE RATES WHY WEL BECAUS I'VE RON IS RELIGIOUSLY COMMITTED HES EVEREADY GOES INTO MARRIAGE BELIEVING IT IS A SACRED BOND THAT ACTUALLY MATTERS CAUSE PEOPLE DON'T DATE FOR SAX PEOPLE ACTUALLY DATE LOOKING FOR TO THE DAY WHEN THY WILL HAE KIDS TOGETHER BECUSE EVERY FAMILY IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD HAS FOUR PLUSS KIDS MAY GO THOSE ARE THE PRECONDITIONS BUT IF THE IF THE IDEA HERE IS THAN YOU'RE YOU'R YOUR BASIC BYNARY IS ARGUEN MARRIED OR DIVORCE DIVORCE IS IS TYPICALLY WORSE THAN NEVER MARRIED AND MARRIED IS WAY BETTER THAN BOTH DIVORCED AND NEVER MARRIED AND SO YET TO RISK BUT IS IT A COINFLIP IONLIS QUINFLIP I THINK IT IS EIGHT IT IS E DECISION THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE AS TO WHAT KIND OF PERSON YOU WISHDATE HOW YOU WISH TO DATE THAT PERSON WHAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP YOU WISH TO BUILDEN HOW SERIOUSLY YOU TAKE THAT COMMANTMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE DO THE LAWS NEED CHANGE ABSOLUTELY NED NEED TO CHANGE THEI'R GARBAGE I TOTALLY

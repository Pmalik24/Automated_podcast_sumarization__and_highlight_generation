QUESTIONS MOUNDS ABOUT THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL CAPACITY OF OUR LEADERSHIP GLASS NEWDY TELLS HIM MURGE ABOUT YORBIDANS VICE PRESIDENTIALLY MALS WITH HUNTER BIDIN AND THE LEGAL REVOLUTION AGAINS TONAL TRUM WELL BE TELIVIZED I VENTURNARE THE SIS THE VENSHGERO SHO  BENCHGIR AR SHOW SPONSIVBY EXPRESS IF VEPIAN PRIVACY IS A RIGHT NOT A PRIVILEGE DOFEND YOUR RIGHTS TEXPRESS TE PIANSI CAM SLASHED BON SO WE NOW LIVE IN A JERANTOCRASY OURE ENTIRE LEADERSHIP CLASS IS REALLY REALLY OLD AND NOT ONLY ARE THEY REALLY OLD THEY'RE NOT EVEN GOOD AT THEIR JOBS IT'S ONE THING TO SAY THAT THE OLD MAN ON THE MOUNTAIN WHILE YOU KNOWT LEAST HE'S GOOD IT IS JOB BUT IF HE'S BADET HIS JOB AND HE IS BORELINE SEE NILE OR HE IS ALREADY ERATIC AND HE JUST GOING MORE ERATIC WITH AGE THE QUESTION BECOMES WHY AS A POPULATION DO WE KEEP NOMINATING THESE PEOPLE WHY DO WE KEEP DOING THIS A MEAN THAT THERE ARE FEW REASONS WHY IT MIGHT BE A REALITY THAT WE KEEP PUTTING UP IN POSITIONS OF POWER REALLY OLD PEOPLE ONE COULD JUST BE THAT THAT THE POWER OF ANERSHA THAT THE PERSON IS IN POWER WE JUS KEP LE LECTING THEM BECAUSE IT'S MORE COMFORTABLE TO GO AT THE DEVIL WE KNOW THAN THE DEVIL THAT WE DON'T AND THAT WOULD BE TRUE FOR SOMEBODY LIKE JOBIDON WHO OF COURSE IS A DEVIL THAT WE KNOW SINCE HE WAS THIRTY ONE YEARS OLD WHERE HE BURST ON TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SCENE WHENHE RAN FOR SENATE AT THE AGE OF THIRTY AND HE HAS NOW EIGHTY SO E'S BEEN IN THE PUBLIC EY FOR HALF A SENTURY AND'SO MEYBE THE IDEA IS WHILE YOU NMORE COMFORTABLE IT THEM WE KNOW AND WE KNO EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KOW ABOUTHIM AN SURE Y'S A LITTLE SEE NILE BUT THAT'S BETTER THAN THAT NEW GUY DOWN THE BLOCK WHAT THAT REALLY BETRAYS IS A LACK OF TRUST IN THE FUTURE OF THE UNITED STATES IF THE PEOPLE THAT YOU KEEP NOMINATING TO HIGH OFFICE OUR PEOPLE WHAVE BEEN TH PUBLIC IC FOR FIFTY YEARS AND THE IDEAIS THAT THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEST POISE TO LEAD THE COUNTRY FORWARD WHY YOU REALLY SAYING IS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT DIRECTION THE COUNTRY IS GOINGS WE MAY AS WELL JUST GIVE IT TO THIS OLD GUY WHO'S BASICALLY DAD AND THIS IS TRUE A CROSS AR I THING THAT REALLY IS THAT THE RASHION OLT FOR WHY SO MANY PEOPLE SEEM COMFORTABLE WITH VOTING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NO LONGER WITH US JOBIDON IS CLEARLY NO LONGER WITH US MITCH MAN CONALL IS APPARENTLY NO LONGER WITH US DIAN FINE STIN IS NO LONGER WITH US IS NOT JUST BY HEWAY ELDERLY PEOPLE IT'S ALSO PEOPLE ORE JUST STANDS INS FOR GENERAL POLITICAL PARTIES JON FETDERMAN IS CLEARLY NOT WITH US AND HE'S SEDDING IN IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW IF THAT MAKES THREE SENATORS OUT OF ONE HUNDRED WHO LITERALLY DO NOT HAVE FULL BRAIN FUNCTION AS SHUT A MATTER OF COURSE AND TWO OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE IN SIGNIFICANT POSITIONS OF LEADERSHIP AR DIAN FINE SENSE IS ON SOME THE MOST IMPORTANT COMMITTEES IN THE SENATE MITCHMAC CONALL IS THE SENATE MYNORITY LEADER AND THAT'S LEAVING ASIDE CHUCKSUMER WHO'SE WELLING TO HIS SEVENTIES AT THIS POINT MEANWHILE YOU OF THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO'SE WANDERING AROUND WOBBLING INTO TREES AND EVERYBODY JS LIKE WHELE I GESS THAT'S TOTALLY FIND AND THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION PARTY IS SEVENTY EIGHT YEARS OLD WH'S A RATIC WHEN HE WAS YOUNG AND HAS GROWN MORE ERATIC THE OLDER THAT HE GOTS SO AGAIN I COME BACK TO THE QUESTION WHY IS IT THAT WE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KEEP PUTTING THESE PEOPLE IN A POSITION THIT'S QUESTION FOR US NONQUISTION FOR THEM I UNDERSTAND WHY OLD PEOPLE WANT POWER O OH PEOPLE WANT POWER FOR THE SEMEREAS AN EVERBODY ELSE ONE'S POWER HOWER'S GREAT POWER LAUGS STO PURSUE THE THINGS THAT WE WISH TO PURSUE OR TO MAINTAIN ARE ARE IMPORTANCE THROUGHOUT THROUGH OUR LIFE SPAN I'VENTUNDERSTAND THE IDEA THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE CERTAIN OLD ER PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL FULLY FUNCTIONAL THER PEOPLE WHO ARE WELL INSO THEIR AIDIES WHO ARE DOING JUST FINE IN MC JAG ARE RIGHT NOW LOOKS A LOT BETTR IN THE URN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHICH SHOWS THAT A LIFE OF SEC STROGS AND ROCK AND ROLL ACTUALLY APPARENTLY IS VERY GOOD FOR YOU IT SORT OF A FOR MALTOHIDE THAT PRESERVES YOU FOREVER BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE JERANTOCRACY THAT NOW RULES THE COUNTRY WHAT THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO IS THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE REPUBLIC BECAUSE AGAIN IF YOU CAN'T TRUST THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FORTY FIVE FIFTY TO LEAD THE COUNTRY IF THERE'S NO VITALITY TO THE LEADERSHIP CLASS WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE DOING IT JUST A HOLDING PATTERN EVERYBODY KNOWS IT JOBIDON HOLDING PATTERN IS SO MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE APPARENTLY TO A MAJORITY OF TH AMERICAN PEOPLE THEN ANYBODY WHO IS FIFTY THAT HE IS GOING TO RUN FOR REELECTION NOT BEING THERE SO YESTERDAY AGAIN HE WAS AM YOU KNOW HE EXCITED THE CRIPT IN DELAWARE FOR JUST A MOMENT THE DOOR POPPED OPEN AND THEN HE WALKED INTO PUBLIC VIEW INSTAID OM  GIITH AND THEN IS GOING BACK TO DELAWARES THE ANSWER FOR THE WEEK END HIS GOING BACK TO DELAWARE AGAIN SO CAN SIT ON THE BEACH SHIRTLESS APPARENTLY HE HAS A WEIRD HABIT OF BATHING IN THE NEWDE WHICH MAN SECRET SERVICE THOSE PEOPLE HAVE A JOB IN ANY CASE ACCARING ROUND EXTRA SUITSFOR THE PRESENT IN CASES HE M IN CASE HE POOP'S ONE AND THEN NOW MAKING SURE THA THE NAKED OLD MAN IS PROTECTED FROM THE VARIOUS ASSASSINS IN THE TRADES HAT'S A JOB AN MA HERE IT WAS THAT JOBIDON YESTERDAY IT FR HIM A HEADQUARTERS GIN I'M GOING TO I'M GOING TO LO ASURETYN WOR O  HEY KNHOW MANY DIFFERENT VIDIOES TO WE HAVE OF THE PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES NOT KNOWING WHERE HE IS GOING SO YOU HAVE TOSE WHOM ONE OF TO THINGS EITHER OF THE ADVAND STEAM WORK IS UNBELIEVABLY CRAPPY AROUND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OR THE PRESIDENT OF TH UNITED STATES LITERALLY DOESN'T ALWAYS GOING AT LEAS SEVEN YOU PERSENT OF THE TIME THAT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE UNLESS YOU THINK THAT I'M JUST RIPPING ON BI NOG GET S MITS MC CONALL IN JUST ONE SECOND NOWTHE MEDIA HAVE AS TAKEN JUST COVERING FOR THE SKY TBECAUSE AGAIN IN A FULLY REACTIONARY ERO WHICH IS WHAT WE LIVE IT IT IS TOTALLY REECTIONAR THE NORMAL AMERICAN IS NOT REACTIONARY THE NORMAL AMERICAN JUST WANTS TO BE LEFT ALONE THE NORMAL AMERICAN WANTS A PREDICTABLE SAT OF LAWS THAT THEY KNOW THE RULES OF THE ROAD AND THEN THEY WANT BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW RAISE THEIR FAMILY GO TO THEIR JOB GO TO CHURCH PAY THEIR TAXES AND BE LEFT ALONE IT'S REALLY WANT MOST AMERICANS WONE THEY JUST WANT TO PREDICTABLE WAY THAT THAT LIFE IS RUN AND MEANWHILE YOU HAVE THE PEOPLE AT THE HIGHEST ECIAL ANTS POLITICS WHO ARE EITHER UTOPIAN OR DESTRUCTIVE AND THEIR BOUNCEING OFF OF ONE ANOTHER IN A VARIETY OF COMBINATIONS AND TO THIS MEANS THAT YOU MUST PROTECT THE PRESSIUS I MEAN IF JOBTON IS CLEARLY NOT WITH US O GOT THE INTIRE LEFT SAYING THE PRECIOUS MUST BE PROTECTED SO FOR EXAMPLE GLEN KESTLER WHOS SUPPOSE TO BE A FACT HE'S LITERALLY CALLED THE FACCHECKER OVER AT THE WASHINGTON POST HAS AN ENTIRE PIECE CALLED BIDON LOVES TO RETELL CERTAIN STORIES SOME AREN'T CREDIBLE NOW NORMALLY WHAT GLENKESTLE DOS HE TAKES A SIMPLE A SIMPLE CLAIM AND THEN HE RATES IT ON A SCALE OF ONCE YO FOR PENOCHIOS IS IT TRUE OR S IT NOTRUE HE DOESN'T DO THAT WHIH OBIDEN INSTEAD HE JUST PUTS ALL OF HIS DUM FALSE STORIES TOGETHER IN ONE STORY AND THE HE'S A WELL YOU KNOW HE HE IS REALLY LIKE A GENIAL OLD MAN BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT A LOT OF HIS STORIES TO STARM TRUES SO I GUESS I ES WERE DONE HERE NO PINOCCHIO RATINGS ON ANY OF THE THINGS THIS IS WHAT THE MEDIA DO WITH JOBIDON MEANWHILE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLE HE SENT A MINORITY LEADER MITCH MC CONALL HE'S OBVESLY SUFFERING FROM SOMETHING HE'S HAD TOO MASSIVE FREEZE UPS IN FROM THE MEDIA INSIDE THE LAST MONTH AND LET'S BE CLEAR MITCH MAC CONALL IS HES SINGLE MOST EFFECTIVE REPUBLICAN LEADER IN THE COUNTRY FOR LAST TWENTY YEARS MEN HERE'S NOT THERE'S JUST NOTE REAL COMPETITION FOR THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF IF YOU LIKE DONALL TRUMPS SUPREME COR PICTUCE CAN THANKMINT'S MAC CONALL IS MITCH MACCONAL HO MADE THAT HAPPEN THAT'S THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION THE LO PROMAS IN TMICH MACCONALL YEUAN SAY THATHE HASN'T STOOD UP FOR PRINCIPLE AS MUCH AS HE SHOULD HAVE WHER THEY SHOUD PUSH HARDER WHEN HE HAD RE PUBLICAN CONGRESS BUT IN TERMS JUST PURE MACKIAVELLIAN POLITICS MITCH MAC CONALL WAS GREAT AT IT ALSO HE'S TO OLD NOW I'M SORRY HE IS HE IS NOT MENTALLY F HE IS NOT MENTALLY CAPABLE OF HOLDING DOWN THE SENT MINORITY LEADER POSITION AND H SHOULD HAND OFF THE POSITION TO SOMEBODY ELSE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE  SANCHA GOUP DOES DOCTOR OVERTYAND AND HE SAYS WELL YOU KNOW HE'S CAN A FREEZING UP AN THAT HE'S NOT FREEZING UP HIS FREEZING IS  WE SHOULD NOT BE ANALYZING THE PEOPLE WHO LEAD THE REPUBLIC AS THOUGH THEY ARE ALL TIMER PATIONS WE SHOULD NOT BE DOING THAT IT IS BAD FOR AMERICA THIS SHOULD BE A BY PARTISAN COLISHAN SAYING THIS BY THE WAY BUT NO ONE'S CAN TO SAY IT AND THE EASON NOWNS CAN TO SAY IT IS BECAUSE FOR A PUBLICANS MUST EFFEND TRUMP WHO SEVENTY EIGHT AND MC CONAL WHO'S EIGHTY ONE AND FOR DEMOCRATS MUST EFFEND JOBIDON WHO'S EIGHTY HE USED TO BE THATHERE'S BROUGHT SPECTROM AGREEMENT ON THINGS LIKE HEY MAYBE WE OUGHT TO YOU NOTE TRANSITION THE LEADERSHIP TO A GENERATION THAT IS NOT IN DEPENDS BUT NO WE'RE ALL GOIN TO JUST GO BACK TO A GO BACK TO OUR VERIOUS CORTERS HERES SANCHA GUP TO ANALYZING THE HEALTH OF TE SEN MY NORTY LEADER WHAT DID YOU SEE WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF WHAT HAPPENS  FIRST FALL LI ME TO SAY THAT WHAT SCOD IS DESCRIBING IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW BECAUSE WHATEVER THIS IS IT IT COMES AND GOES AND IT SEEMS TO COME AND GO QUICKLY AND IN THE WORLD OF A A AND WHEN YOU LOOKHIM AT THE BRAIN THAT'S AN IMPORTANT SORT OF CLUE WHAT I SAW AND AND THIS AS I THINK AN APPROPRIATE TERM HERE IS THE THERE'S THE TERM FREEZING A THAT THAT DOES THAT DOES SORT O DESCRIBE THIS FREEZING OF HIS BODY FREEZING OF HIS FEACH FREEZING OF HIS FACE HIS HANDS WERE VERY CLENCHED TO THE SIDE OF THE LECTURN I CAN I MEAN WHELE NO PROBEM MEAN AFTER ALL WE HAVE MANY NONFUNCTIONAL MEMBERS OF OUR TOP LEVELL OF GOVERNMENT IN JUST ONE SECOND WE'LL GET TO YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO THEORETICALLY COULD TAKE OVER FOR PEOPLE LIKE MITTHR MAC CONAL WILL GET TO THAT IN  JUST ONCE SECOND ANWE'LL GET TO MORE CORRUPTION IN THE BIDON ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE JOBIDON IT'S NOT THAT THE ARGMEN NESTER BYN MELLY IS NOT THAT HE SEENILE THE PROBLEC JOBIDINS THT HE'S BEEN CORRUPTFOR FIFTY YEARS WILLGETS THAT MOMENTARILY FIRST LADMER PUTENT CALLED THE USTOLLER'S DROP AN DOMINENTS OBJECTIVE NEA REVERSIBL BRAZIL RUSSIA INDIA CHINA SOUTH AFRICA FORMERLY AGREED TO USE LOCAL CURRENCIES IN TRADE INSTEAD OF THE UAS DOLLAR  THAT IS NOT A SHOCK AS THE WORLD BECOMES LESS GLOBELL AS  COUNTRY'S MOVE AWAY FROM THE INFLUENCE OF THE UNITED STATES THEY ARE GOING TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE ASTOLLAR HOW DO YOU PROTECT YOUR OWN ASCET BASE WELL IT'S ONE REASONS DIVERSIFYT INTO A PRECIOUS MENALL LIKE GOLL THIS IS WHY BIRCHGOLD IS BUSIER THAN EVER INVESTORS AND SAVORS ARE LOOKING TO HARNESS THE POWER PHYSICAL GOLD HELD AN ATTACKS SHELTER DIARE I BAGOL FROM BIRCH GOLDEN I TRUST THEM TO HELP ME DIVERSE FY MY SAVINGS HE IMPROTECT OUR IRIT OR FOR ONE CAN BY DIVERSEIFYING WITH GOLD FROM BIRCHT GOLD AS THE OSTOLLAR CONTINUES TO SEIVE PRESSURE FROM FORN COUNTRYES DIGUNAL CURRENCY AND CENTRAL BANKS ARM YOURSELF WUTH THE INFORMATION YOU NEED ON HOW

TO NINETYEIGHT NINETY EIGHT NINETYEIGHT TO DAY THAT'S BEN TO NINETY EIGHT NINETY EIGHT NINETY EIGHT O KASE SO THERE ARE PEOPLE WHOARE WAITIN IN THE WINGS FROM MICH MC CONALD STEP DOWN AND CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION EVEN IF MC CONAL STEPS DOWN ANDYO BE SURE THE GOVERNOR OF KENTUCKY CAN'T ACTUALLY JUST APPOINTO DEMOCRAT BESHURE'S A DEMOCRAT BUT THEY CHANGE THE LAW IN THE TATE OF KENTUCKY S THE BESHER HAS TO CHOOSE FROM THE SAME PARTY AS THE PERSON WHOS STEP DOWN PROBABLY IN ANTICIPATION OF ALL OF THIS AND HAS TO CHOOSE ONE OF THREE PEOPLE MOMINATED BY THE STATE REPUBLICAN PARTY SO THAT MEANS THAT EVEN IF MC CONALWARD O STEP DOWN COMPLETELY FROM THE SENATE YOU'D BEOUR PLACE BY REPUBLICAN THE SAME THING BY THE WAY'S TRUGE DIAN FINESTON AND THIS IS THE PART OWHEN IT GET TO THE HE IRRITATION THAT I HAVE FOR THE ALLAGE IS THE ALLEGIANCE THE PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO THESE THESE OLD FUDDY DUDIES WHAT IT REALLY COMES DOWN TWOIS NO ONE WANTS TO STABLISH A PRECIDENT THAT YO SHOULD GET RID OF AN ELDERLY PERSON IN A POSITION OF POWER JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE SENIL BECAUS THEY'RE TOO MANY SEENAL PEOPLE IN THEIR OWN PARTY THEY WAN TO MAINTAIN AND THAT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE THE TOP THO TICK IT IF YOU GET RID OF DIAN FINESTINE FOR NOPING FULLY FUNCTIONAL WHAT'S THE ARGMENT FOR KEEPING BINE HE'S GOT A DEMOCRAT BACKING M UP IN COMALL HARRIS I UNDERSTAND THT YOU'D RATHER HAE THE DEAD OLD WHITE MAN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT THAN YOU WOULD HAVE THE VERY VERY UN POPULAR BLACK WOMAN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BUT IS THAT REALLY AN EXCUSE GIVING THE JOBIDE IS NOT FUNCTIONAL AND EVERYONE CAN SEE IT IF THEY GET RID OF DIAN FINSTIN WHO LEGITIMATELY CANNOT WRITE HER OWN NAME AT THIS POINT WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY GET RID OF JOHN FETTERMAN WHAT HAT NOW ALMOST PEOPLE GOT AR PLACE BY DEMOCRATS BY THE WAY BUT THIS HELP PERVERSE AND AND VENAL ARE POLITICS AS BECOME ORE DON T KEEP THOSE PEOPLE IN PLACE WREN'T KEP THOSE PEOPLE ON SO THE THE VERY IDEA THAT THE LEADERSHIP CLASS EVEN MATTERS HAS KIND OF EXPLODED ALL THAT MATTERS RIGHT NOW IS THE BINARY THE PARTY BINEARY YOU'RE THE REPUBLIGAN EAROR DEMOCRAT AND DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU ARE APPARENTLY BECAUSE WEN JUST PLUG SOMEBODY ELSE IN ORW JUST LEAVE YOU THERE BEING A DEAD PERSON WE CAN MANIPULATE YOUR HANDS LIKE YOU'RE SOME SORT OF WEARED MARIONET AND APPARENTLY WE'LL ACHIEVE THE SAME EXACT RESULT THE SOME THE PEOPLE BY THE WAY WHO THEORETICALLY COULD JUST FREPLACE MC CONALL TO DAY ARE JOHN THOON A SOUTH TO KODAK HE IS SIXTY TWO HE IS ALSO THE NUMBER TWO CENTER REPUBLICAN HE'S THE WHIP GOT JOHN CORNAN OF TAXAS WHO IS SEVENTY ONE GAN AT THE AT THIS POINT THA MAE TOWA SPRING CHICKEN AMONG OUR LEADERSHIP CLASS YOT JOHN BOROSSO ALSO SEVENTY ONES WO THE YOUNGER GENERATION IT'S SEVENTY ND TEN YOU AVE PEOPLE LIKE JONY EARNSTON IWAL WHO IS FIFTY THREE WHO'S THE NUMBER FOUR AS A CHAR OF THE REPUBLICAN POLICY COMMTTEE THE FACT THAT OUR LEADERSHIP CLASSIN GENERAL HAS BECOME SO OLD IS IS TOTALLY INSANE TO ME LIKE TOTALLY INSANE RONALD'S RAGAN WHEN HE RAN FOR OFFICE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY WAS CONSIDERED BY MANY PEOPLE TOO OLD OK ANDA RONALD'S RAGAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY HE HE WAS SOM HE WAS  SEVENTY TWO IN NINETEEN EIHTY SO IT'S SEM PRETTYMAZING WHEN HE'S IN ALLGRATED THE SECOND TIME HE WAS A HU SEVENTY SEVEN WHICH MAKES HIM CURRENTLY YOUNGER THAN BOTH OF OUR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES SO THING THINGS ARE GOING GREAT  IT'S IT'S ALL GOOD MEANWHILE JOBITON CONTINUES TO BE AS VENAL INCORRUPT AS A HE EVER WAS APPARENTLY WE NOW HAVE NEWS THAT HUNDER BIDON'S ROSEMONTSON CAPARTNERS INVESTMENT FORM TRATED MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND EMALES WITH

WHICH BY THE WAY IS NOT IN AMAZING WAY TO RUN A CAMPAIGN ONCE AGAIN DONAL TRUMP IS A BILLIONAIRE IF YOU'RE GIVEN MONEY TO TRUMPS CAMPAIGN YOU SHOULD REALLY WANT HIM TO SPEND THAT ON UNOR THARGANING JOBIDON BUT THAT'S NOT WHERE THE MONEY IS BEING PENT ME WELL DONAL TRUMP IS TRYING TO GO AFTER GOVERNOR BRYAN CAMP IN GEORGIA HE SUGGESTING THE BRYNG CAMP SHOULD START IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS AGAIN FOR TANT FANNY WILLIS WHOS THE D A IN GEORGIA THERE IS NO GROUND THERE'S NO LEGAL GROUND FOR IMPEACHING FANNY WILLIS NOW YOU CAN SAY OH KET WEL THERE'S NO LEGAL GROUND FOR HER GOING AFTER DONAL TRUMP EITHER BUTIT'S NOT UP TO I'S NOT UP TO BRYING CAMP THE TATE LEGISLATURE IS NOT GOING TO DO IT WHICH MEANS THAT CAN TO GET DONE AND IT'S JUST GOING T BE BUNCH OF POLITICAL POSTERING AND THEATRE AND SO BRYANG CAMP HONESTLY TO HIS CREDIT IS LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT I'M I'M BUSY RUNNING A STATE HERE THE SOMEBODY HAS TO BE IN ADULTIN TH ROOM I MEAN AT SOME AT SOME POINT HERE HERE'S BRANCAMP THE BOTTOM LINE IS HAT IN THE STATE OF GEORGE IS LONG AS I'M GOVERNOR WE'RE GOIN TO FALL OF THE LAW IN THE CONSTITUTION REGARDLESS OF WHOIT HELPS OR HARMS POLITICALLY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS SOME INSIDE AN OUSIDE OF THIS BUILDIN MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT BUT I CAN ASSUREYU I HAVE NOT IN GEORGEA WE WILL NOT BE ENGAGING IN POLITICAL THEOR THE ONLY INFLAMES THE MOSONS OF THE MOMENT WEW'LL DO WHAT IS RIGHT WE'LL UP HOLD OUR OUS HIS PUBLIC SERVANTS IN IS BOBELIEF THAT OUR STATE WILL BE BETTER OFF FOR HE SAYS WE HAVE A LAW IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA THAT CLEARLY OUTLINES T E LEGAL STEPS THAT CAN BE TAKEN IF CONSTITUENTS BELIEVE THATR LOCAL PROSECUTORS ARE VIOLATING THEIR OATH BY ENGAGING IN ON ATHICAL OR ILEGAL BEHAVIOR UP TO THIS POINT OF NOTSEIN EVIDENCE THAT THE A WILLS IS ACTIONS ARE LACKE TEIR OF WARN'T ACTION BY THE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY OVER SIE COMMISSION  GETE LATE AGAIN A BAD PROSECUTION DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT BRANCAMP HAS THE POWER OR THE ABILITY OR SHOULD USE THAT ABILITY THO DO THIS NOWT AGAIT I TOTALLY GET THE REACTIONARY SENTIMENT WHICH HAS IF ANUELLS IS DOING SOMETHING WRONG SO VIOLATE WHATEVER LAWS YE HAVE TO IN ORD TO GET RID OF HER SINCE SHU'S VIOLATIN WHREVER LAW SHE HAS TO AN I GO AFTER DONAL TRUMP THE PROBLEM IS THAT IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA THE REASON OF BRANCAMP THOUG THE PRINCTABALE RESULT OFTHIS AND NO ONE HAS ANY SECOND ORDER THINKING IT AT EVER EVER O CASE LET'S AS SOM THE BRANCAM DID WHAT YOU ANN'T DO LET'S IN THE BRANCAMP AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN GEORGIA WHICH IS A VERY PRURPLE STATE NOW THANKS TO THE INISTRATIONS OF PEOPLE LIKE DONAL TRUMP LET'S SAY THAT THEY WENT AHEAD AND THEY MOVE FOR THE IMPEACHMENT IF ANNUELLIS LET' SAY THAT THEY GOT IT WHAT' SAY THEY ACHIEVE THEIMPEACHMENT IF ANYILLIS HAING RE PUBLICANS RNIN DO IN TH ELECTION AFTER THAT WES HINGO GREAT FOR THEM OR DO YOU THINK THAT THEY MIGHT RUN INTO SOMMISSUES BRYANCAMP STOOD UP TO THE ATTEMPTS TO OVERTURN THE RESULTS OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION IN GEORGIA AND THENY WHEN AN OVERWHELMING VICTORY AGAINST STACY ABRAMS WHO'SE SUPPOSE IT STACY ABRUMS LEST WE FORGET WITH SUCH IN AMAZING GODDESS ACCORDING TO LEFT THAT THEY MADE HER THE EMPRESS OF OF ALL THE UNIVERSE ON SARTRACK THATS YOU STACY ABRAMS WAS AND SHO'S DEFEATED SOLIDLY BY BRANCAMP MEANWHILE IN THAT SAME EXACT RAS HERSHAL LALKER DONE FROM CHOSEN VIC FOR SENTET LOSTRO ILE WORNOK SO INSTEAD OF FIGHTING PURIC VICTORIES THAT END UP ACTUALLY UNDERMINING THE ABILITY TO WEN E LECTIONS IN THE FUTURE MAYBE WE OUGHT TO USE A LITTLE BIT OF POLITICAL SMARTS HERE BUT I GUESS UP I THAT'S THE QUESTION ARE WEEN THE BUSINESS OF PURIC VICTORIES OR PURIC LOSSES OF THE CASE MAN MAXY MAY NOT EVEN GET WHAT YOU WANT OR ARE YOU INTE BUSINESS OF UNA LONG TURM BUILDING IN ORDER TO STOP THE LEFTS AT GENDA AND IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY IS A SHORT FROM THINKER THIS ONE OF THE OTHER REASONS WHY AS TO GET BACK TO THE THE FIRST TOPICALWE DISCUSSED THAT THE ONE O THE REASONS WHY YOU YOU HAVE EIGHT YEAR OLDS THA HAD A GOVERNMENT IS BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY IS LIKE BUYING A SHORT HURBOND RIGHT THAT THAT THEY THE EXPIRATION ATE ON THE THING IS VERY VERY SOON AND SO WE ARE SO UNEASY ABOUT THE LONGS FROM FUTURE WE DON'T BUILD MOVEMENTS ANY MORE WE MAKE SHORT TERM PLAYS IN THE HOPE THAT THE OTHERSIDE WIL AKE A BAD SHORT TRUMPLAY WHICH MEANS EFFECTIVELY YOU'RE STWAITING FOR THE OTHER SIDE TO DO SOMETHING TRULY AGREE JUST ORDIOR WAITING FOR SOME SORT OF GROUND SHIFT TO HAPPEN SOME DALSEC MACCANA NOW THE REALITY IS THE DAYASEC MACONIT AND POLITICS RARELY ARRIVES WHAT OU SHOULD BE DOING IS BUILDING LONG TUR MOVEMENTS DOW BE THE THING THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING IS THAT SOMETHING THAT EITHER SIDE ISNT WILE THE LEFT IT IT FOR FIFTY YEARS NOW SEEMS LIKE THEIR STUCK IN A RUD THE RIGHT DID IT WITH REGARD TO ROVERS'S WADED AND THEY ACHIEVE VICTORY IN GETTING SUPRIM CORT TO OVERTURN ROVERS'S WAED BUT IT SEEMS LIKE MOVEMENT BUILDING IS A LOT OF HARD WORKS LOT IN CROMENTAL WORK IT'S NOT REWARDING AND A YUNISALOT EASIER IS TO SHOUT AT THE MOON THAT'S THAT'S THE THING THAT IS A LOT EASIER AND MEANWHILE ON THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR RE PUBLICAN AT SIDE OF THE ISLE THE POLES CONTINUE SHOW DONAL TRUMP WITH A MASSIVE AND DURABLE LEAD HE CONTINUES TO BE LEADING IN THE REAL CLERPOZIX POLL AVERAGE BY ABOUT FORTY POINTS THE LATIST ECONOMIST YOUGOV POLE HAS BEEN FIFTY TWO PER CENT NATIONALLY AND RONDISANTIS AT SIXTEEN PER CENT AGAIN THE LINE UP IS THE SAME IT'S BEEN TE SAME FOR MONTHS AT THIS POINT IT GOES TRUMP DO SANTIS AND THEN WAY BEHIND THE REST OF THE PACK YOU'LL HAVE A VARIETY OF ROMASWAMY HALY PENS AND CRISTY AND THOSE OF THE ONLY CANDIDATES OR EVEN ON THE STAGE AND ALL OF THEM OR RUNNING WAY THE HELL BEHIND DONAL TRUM AT THIS POINT IN TIME NOW IN IWA IT'S POSSIBLE THE SUMMIN COULD SCORE AND UPSET VICTORY IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO POLLING AN IA RIGHT NOW TRUMP IS UP BUT E'S UP BY ABOUT TWENTY POINTS ABOUT HALF HIS NATIONAL LEAD IN IWA AND IS HENRY ULSON POINTS OUT DONAL TRUMP HAZA HAS MADE A RISKY MOVAN IWILE BY PISSING LAWFUL LOT OF THE MAIN LEADERS IN IWA HENRY ULSON N THE WASHINGTON POSES OU'LD BE EASY TO CONCLUDE FROM THE POLES THAT TRUMPL CRUES TO VICTORY AND I WAS CAUXES IN JANUARY SPEND A WEEK IN THE STATE IT BECOMES FARLESS CERTAIN THE FORMER PRESENT WILL STAR OFF PRIMARY SEASON WITHIN EARLY VICTORY BECAUSE I WAS EVENTELICAL CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY IS NOT YET SOLD ON HIM IS THAT TALK TO IWA EVENTHELICAL PASTERS AN GRASSERIT'S LEADERSE FLLUNDERSTAND THE NEWANTS IS OF THEIR COMMUNITY BETTER THAN ANY POLSTER THEIR MES SAGE WAS SURPRISINGLY UNIFORM I WAS HE VENTOLICALS HAVE NOT MADE UP THEI'R MINDS AS OF YET NOW CULD TRUMP LOSE IWONCE SO WHEN THE WHEN THE PRIMARSHORE I MEAN HE ABSOLULY COUD THE THE THE REAL QUESTION IS WHETHE FIELD IS GOING TO CONSOLIDATE AND WHEATHER IT'S GOING TO CONSOLIDATE BEHIND ONE ALTERNATIVE CANDIDATE EVEN THEN TRUMP STILL HAS THE UPPER HANDICORNE TO CURENT POLLING UNLESS SOMETHING DRAMATIC CHANGES BHET TO MORE ON THAT JUST ONE SECOND FIRSE THEYVER

OF THE BENSHIPIRO SHOES ON HIS SPECIAL IN THIS EPISODE WE DIE CUS HOW TO CREED A FREE SOCIETY THROUGH DUTY AN RESPONSIBILITY AND HOW LEFT I STIDEOLOGY HAS EVOLVED AND PLANTED ITSELF INTO OUR SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS PLUS WE DALL THEM TO HOW CHRISS TRANSITION FROM YOUNG LEFTUS TO A FORCE FOR GOOD IN THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT IT'S A GREAT CONVERSATION EVERYBODY SHOULD HEAR IT HERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF THE TRAILER IJUS STARTED LOOKING AT THE PEOPLE AROUND IN THESE A KIND OF LEFTWING RADICAL STUDENT GRUPS AND AND POLITICAL MOVEMENTS AND WHAT I FOUND IS THAT THESE WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF THE MOST ELEATE PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE GLOBE THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE USING THIS VOCABULARY CYNICALLY TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN STATUS TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN POWER AND THEN AFTER A COUPLE YEARS OF WEARING THE CAFIA ARE GOING TO GO ON AND TAKE OVER THEIR FATHER'S COMPANY AND THAT WAS REALLY THE THE QUESTION WELL IF THESE PEOPLE ARE UTTERLY A MORAL FRAUDS MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THESE IDEAS MAKE SURE YOU CHECK OUT THE LATEST EPISODE THE BENCHO PEARO SHO SUNDAY SPECIAL THIS SUNDAY ON DAILY OUR PLUSS YOU TO AND ANYBOD YO LISTEN TO POTCAS MEANWHILE WE NE TOK LOOK AT THE OTHER REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES NOBODY SEEMS TO BE GAINING A TON OF MOMENTUM SO RONISANTIS HANDLED THE LATEST HURRICAGNE IN FLORIDA QUITE WELL EVERYBODY'S SORT OF UNDERSTANDS THAT ECEMP FOR OF COURSE PRESEDET AND TRUMP WHO'S RIPPING ON HIM CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT THE HANDLING OF TE HURRICAGNE BECAUSE THIS IS THE WAY WE DO OUR POLITICS NOW O DESANIS HANDLED TAT PRETTY WELL ACCORDING TO POLITICO IT SHOWED WHY HE'S A DARLING OF CONSERTERCE IN THE DONER CLASS HAT ALSO EXPOSES HIS VULNERABILITY WHY EXACOLY WELL BECAUSE NO REASON I MEAN THEY CANRALLY EXPLAIN WHY HE ID A BAD JOB BUT THEY'RE SAYING THAT EXPOSED HS VONERABILITY MAINLY BECAUSE IN OUR STUPID POLITICS IF YOU'RE GOOD AT A JOB THAT DOESN'T HELP YOU AT ALL APPARENTLY AND THE THE BIGGEST THING IS THAT OTHER PEOPLE CAN ATTACK YOU  WITH REGARD TOO YOUR PERFORMANCE BETTER NOT TO BE AN OFFICE YOU CAN ATTACK EVERYBODY THAN TO BE AN OFFICE TRYING TO DO THE THING SO THERE IS THAT O MEANWHILE NEVER BACK DOWN WHICH IS OT WHICH HIS RONICANTS IS SUPERPACK I THEY ARE SHIFTING THEIR RE SOURCES TO THE EARLY STATES RECOGNIZING THAT HERE GON NEED TO WIN THE EARLY STATES EARLY IF THEY WISH TO  CARRY ON THE CAMPAIGN BEYOND THAT RIGHTHERE'S THE SIMPLE MATH IN THEREPUBLICAN PRIME EREIS GOS IOWA NEW HAMPSHIR SOUTH CAROLINA THE SANTIS BASICALLY HAS TO WINT ALLTHREE IF HE WINS IWA AND HE LOSES NEW HAMPSIRE TRUMP TRUMPIS GON WALK AWAY WITH IT IF HE WINS IWA IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND TRUMP WIN SOUTH CAROLINA HANDALY BECAUSE THE FIELD SPLITS TRUMPIS PROLIGANASWEEP AN TH THIS IS THIS IS THE MATH FOR TO SANTIS OE SHIFTING ALL HIS RESOURCES INTO THE EARLY STATES HE SHOULDHAVE DONE THAT EARLIER IS THE TRUTH HE THEYVE ENDED THEIR DORNOCKING IN NEVADA AND THE SUPERTO SAY SAY SOME ME BLESSING THIS IS SIGN OF TO SANTIS CAMPAIGN'S WEAKENESS MAYBE IT MAY ALSO BE A SIGN OF JUST TRUMP STRENGTH IN A LOT OF THESE STATES THE CAN'T DIVERSIFIER FORCE S YOUHAVE TO CONCENTRATE THEM WHERE YOU THINK TRUMP IS MOST VULNERABLY GOT A KNOCK HIM OUT OF THE BOX RIGHT OUT O THE GATE THAT THAT BASICALLEY'S THE ONLY WAY TO WIN THESE PRIMARIES  NICKEY HALEY IS TARTING GAIN SOME CREDTABILITY IT LOOKS RIGHT NOW AS THO THE REST OF THE FIGHT THE REST OF THE FIELD MAY CONSOLIDATE DOWN TO DO SANTIS FERSES HAILEY OT WHICH WULD NOT BE PARTICUALLY SHOCKING ROMASUWAMY IS RUNNING A SELF FUNDED CAMPAIGN HE ALSO IS I WOULD SAY THE DARLING OF A SORT OF HE LEAT IN THE IN THE TWITTER VERSE BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE TREMENDOUS GRASSER SUPPORT HE'S NOT REALLY BUILDING A GRASSRYS ORGANIZATION IS GETING A LOT OF EARN MEDIA AN THAT ERN MEEDYA HAS NT EESARELY TRANSLATING INTO HEIGHTEN POLL MUMBERS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE HE'S CATERING TO A PARTICULAR SUB SET OF PEOPLE WHAR ON TWITTER BY SAYING SORT OF THINGS THAT I THINK HE KNOWS ARE NOT TRUE AND THEN HE IS AND THEN HE SORT OF NEW ONSING THEM AFTERWARD SO DO IT DOI THINK THAT ROMASWUAMMY IS THAT THE VAGUE IS A A SORT OF DURABLE CANDIDATE GOING FOWARD IN TH RE PUBLICAN PARTY MAY IT MAYBE NEXT TIME AROUND I DON'T THNK THIS TIME AROUND HE IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE TOP THREE CANDIDATES IT SEEMS LIKE RIGHT NOW THE FIELD SEEMS TO BE CONSOLIDATING A ROUND TRUMP TO SANTIS HAILEY THAT'S TRUMP BILOCK A HUGE MARGIN AND THEN TE SANTIS AND HALEY AFTER THAT MI PENCE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE GAINING ANY SORT OF MOMENTUM HE'S STILL SPEAKING TO SMALL CROWDS IN IOWA AGAIN  HTHE QUESTION IS TO WHY PENCE HIS RUNNING REMAINS AT THE TIP OF EVERYBODY'S TONGUE THE TRUTH IS TO PROBABLY IS JUST A WAY TO TO BUTTON UP HIS LEGACY I BECAUSE THETHE REALITY IS THE TRUMP IS STILLVERY POPULAR INSIDE THEIR PUBLICAN PARTY PENCE DEFENDING HIS OWN ACTIONS IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE I THING IS WELL WORTH WHILE WHETHER THAT HAS TO HAPPEN IN T A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN I I AM NOT IAM NOT CERTAIN MEANWHILE IN OTHER POLITICAL NEWS THE WHITE HOUSE IS BEGGING CONGRESS TO PASS SHORT FROM SPENDING YEALL AND BOOSE FOODATE ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON POST THERE URGING CONGRES TO ADOPT TA SHORT TOR MESSURE TO FUN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT A MOVEMENT TO BUY TIME FOR LALL MAKERSCRAFT A BROUGHT OR SPENDING DEAL AND AVERT ANOTHER SHUT DOWN AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER SO HERE IS THE MATH AN FOR EVERYBODY HOWE DO THE SHUT TOWN ROTINE LIKE EVERY SIX MONTHS IN THIS COUNTRY HERE'S THE MATH IF REPUBLICANS CONTROL THE HOUSE BUT NOT THE SENATE OR THE PRESIDENCY THE'RENOT CAN TO GET EVERYTHING THEY WANT END OF STORY THAT'S THAT'S ALL AND IF THERE IS A MASSIVE GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN AND WHICH THINGS JUST DON'T MOVE FORWARD THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKELY TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF THAT OVER TIME IS JUST THE WAY THE POLITICAL MOUTH WORKS AR THE PEOPLE WHAR NOT SIGNING THE CHACKS SO JOBIDON WRONGFOOTED HIMSELF LAST TIME IN THE SHOWDOWN HE SAID I'M NOT AN NEGOTITE AT ALL HE'S SAID NO NEGOTIATIONS THERE'S A HUGE MISTAKE BY HIM HE'S A LAD MC CARTHY TO COME FORWARD AND SAY OKAY WELL WE ARE GON NEGOTIATE I WAHERE'S OUR OPENING POSITION LET'S NEG OTIATE AND BYNAES LAY I'M NOT NEGOTIANIN YOU ADE BY LOOK LIKE THE BAGGI WELL THESE THEWAIR STUPID POLITICAL MOUNT A NOT THE WAIT LISTEN IN IDEALLY IN AN AT IDEALISTICALLY PURE WORLD THE WAY THAT WORK IS REPUBLICAN TO SAY HERE ARE THE HERE ARE THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS FUNDED AS DEPARTMENTS RI THET BE WHAT WE CALL REGULAR ORDER IT HASN'T OBTAINED IN WASHINGTON TO SEE FOR AT LEAST A COUPLE OF DECADES I WILL FUND THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT THAT WE'LL FUND THE EDUCATION DEPARTMNT THAT WELL FUND THET COMMERCE DEPARTMENT THAT THAT HASN'T HAPPENED WE'VE BEN DOING OMNIBUSES FOR LAST SEVERAL DECADES IN THE UNITED STATES HET SO THE NORMAL WAY THAT WOULD WORK IS THAT THEY'VE THEN NEGOTIATE OVER EACH ONE O THOS BILLS AND THAT HASN'T HAPPENED BECUSE TERE'S TO MUCH BACK SCRATCHANG IN THERE'SO MUCH PORK BERREL ROLLING AND THERE'S THERE'S TOO MUCH NEGOTIATION WITH THE OTHER BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND THEOTHER PARTY ET WITH THAT SAID IF REPUBLICANS TAKE TET UP FROM POSITION WE 'RE NOT NEGOTIATIN WHATSOEVER THE'E GON TO BEAR THE POLITICAL BRONT IF SOMETHING DOES NOT GO FORWARD YEU GOT O GET THE BEST THAT YOU CAN GET AN IS IT'S MY JOB TO POINT OUT WERE THAT TRACE FRM PRINCIPLE BUT IT'S THE JOB OF PEOPLE  IN CONGRESS TO GET THE BESS THAT THEY CAN GET RIGD IT'S ALL HA NEGOTIATION SO WHEN JO BIDN DEMANDS A SHORT FROM SPENDING BILL SHOULD HE BE GIVEN A SHORT FROM SPENDING BOLT NO HE SHOULD NOT BU RE PUBLICANS SHOULD LAY OUT A COUPLE OF KEY CONCESSIONS THEY WISH TO WIN IN THE NEXT SPENDING BATTLE ANDTHEN THEY SHOULD FIGHT FOR THOSE CONCESSIONSAND THEY SHULD SAY LISSEM WERE WILLING TO GIVE UP A LOT OFSTUFF THAT WE DON'T WANT O GIVE U BUT YOU GOT TO GIVE SOMETHING TO THAT IS THE WAY THAT YOU WIN A GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN FIGHT CONTRARY TO CAN OF TALK RADYO OPINION THE WAY THE WHEN A GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN FIGHT IS NOT TYPICALLY TO SHUT DOWN THE GOVRNMENT FOR PROLONGED PERIODS OF TIME IT DOESN'T SEEM TO REDOWNCET THE BENEFIT OF THE PARTY PERCEIVED AS BEING MORE INTRANSIGEN NOW AS THI SAY THE DEMOCRATS CAN FALL IN TO THE TRAP RIGHT THE EMOCRATS CAN SAY WE WON'T TO GOTIATE AT ALL WORGAN A BE INTRANSGENT THEN THEY WILL PAY THE POLITICAL PRICE FOR THEY'RE ENTRANSGENTS THE CHIO P DEMANDS MARK SHARPBREAKE WITH TH DEAL PARTY LEADERS INCLUDING HOW SPEAKER MC CARTHY WORKED OU WIT THE PRESIDENT THO SPRING TO RAISE THE NATIONS TETLEMENT THE SUPPOSE TO PREVENTS ANOTHER STALE MATE OVER SPENDING THIS FALL NOW THE BIHT ADMINISTRATIONS EXPLICITLY ASKING CONGRESS TO ADOPT WHAT IS KNOWN AS A SAR THAT'S CONTINUING RESOLUTION AT THIS POINT SO NOW WERE CAN T HAVE THAT BATTLE  NEXT WEEK EARLIER OF THIS MONTH MC CARTHY AND CHUCKSHUME MER EACH SIGNALED EARLY SUPPORT FOR CONTINUING RESOLUTION THEY MIGHT OFFER LALL MAKERS MORE TIME TO CRAFT A FULL YEAR SPENDING DEAL I'M BUT O MITCH MC CONELL SAD ON WEDNESDAY IT'S PRETTY BIG MASS HE PREDICTED THAT LALL MKERS WOULD ADOUPT TO SHORT FROM DEALIND TO DECEMBER WHILE THEY TRUGGER TO  STRUGGLE I FIGR OUT EXACTLY WITH GOVERNMENT SPENDING LEVEL IS  GOING TO BE THE REASON THAT I SAY THAT THE SPLIT GOVERNMENT WORKS THAT THAT THAT THE SPPLIT GOVERNMENT BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRAT'S MEANS THAT PUBLICANS ARE NOT GOING TO GET WHAT THEY WANT OUT OF THE DEAL IS BECAUSE THEY WON'T JOUMONS CAN OVEETO IT THIS SORT OF LIKE THE QUIXOTIC QUEST IDEALISTICALLY PURE BUT POLITICALLY POLITICALLY COUNTER PRODUCTIVE A TEMPT BY TEN CRUIS IN LIKE TWENTY FOURTEEN TO D FUN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO GET CHUT AT TO GET BAROCKABO MACH OREPEALABOMICAR IT WAS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BROCKLON WAS NOT GOING TO REPEAL ABOMICAR AND THAT THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS THAT MAY HELP INDIVIDUAL POLITICIONS BECAUSE IT MAKE THEM LOOK PURER TO THE BAYS THAT DON'T ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THE THING BUT THAT THERE'S DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AN ACTIVELY STUMPING FOR THINGS THAT YOU THINK YOU CAN ACHIEVIN NEGOTIATION RIGT CHIP ROY DID THAT LAST TIME AROUND HE DID THAT WITH REGARD TO THE THE BUDGETING PROCESS AND HE ALSO DO THAT WITH REGARD TO FOR EXAMPLE KEVEN MAC CARTHY SPEAKERSHIP ITSELF AND HE WANTS HIM IMPORTANT CONCESSION SO THAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IS IS ON THE TABLE MEANWHILE JOBIDON TRYING TO LOCK UP THE YOUTH VOT BY GIVING THEM LEED APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO POLITICAL THE BITE ADMNISTRATIONS DEPARTMENT OF HELTH IN HUMAN SERVICES IS RECOMMENDING THAT THE D E  SIGNIFICANTLY LOOSIN FEDERAL RESTRICTIONS ON MARIWANA STOPE SHORT OF ADBISING IT HOULD BE ENTIRELY REMOVED FROM THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE IS ACT THE HEALTH GENCY WANTS THE DRUG MOVE FROM SCHETURAL ONE TO SCHETTURAL THREE UNDER THE SESA THATIT'S POTENTIALLY THE BIGEST CHANGE IN FEDERAL DRUG POLICY ANS DECADE SO WE ALREADY HAVE A HUGE PERCENTAGE OF AMERICAN YOUNGSTERS WHO ARE TOKING AND ON MAKING NOTHING OF THEIR LIVES SO THEN THE FIRST OF ALL WE AVE NOW TOBUNKED IN VERY THOROUGH FASHION THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNIC HAS DOBONE THE IDEA THAT MARIWAN IS NOT ADDICTIVE THAT IS NOT TRUE IT IS JUST NOTRUE FIRST VALT IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY MORE POTENT THAN WHEN YOU WORKIT SECOND OF ALL IT IS ACTUALLY QUITE ADDICTIVE FOR A LARGE PERCENTAGE PEOPLE WHO TAKE IT THE IDEA THAT IT IS COMPLETELY BEENIGN PORTULIF YOUNG PEOPLE IS AE COMPLETE LIE I DON'T NO  CULTURALLY GOT TOTHE POINT WERE TO BACKO PRODUCTS ARE CONSIDERED THE GREAT ROUT OF ALL EVIL BECAUSEYOU MIGHT DI HAVE LUNG CANCER WHEN YOU'R SIXTY BUT MARWANA WHICH MAKES YOU USELESS IF YOUD IF YOU USE IT ON THE REGULAR IS SOMEHOW CONSIDERED WHAT' SOME SORT OF SOCIETAL GOOD I MAN I KNOW PEOPLE PERSONALLY WHO HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS ITH MARIWANA ADDICTION AND IT IS A IT IS A IT IS A MASSIVE ISSUE AND MEANWHILE THE BIDE ADMINISTRATION SEEKING APPARENTLY TO MAKE EVERYBODY FAT STUPID USELESS IS A IS GOING TO MOVE TOWARD MORD CRIMINALIZATION ON ON MARIWANA NA CAN MAKE THE CASE THE FEDERL GOVERNMENT IS BAD AT THE WARRENDRUGS THAT THAT'S A CASE THAT I'M ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT WARM TO BUT THAT'S ON A CASE THAT JOBIDNIS OVER MADE HE'S DOING THIS ON IDEA LOGICAL GROUNDS SO THE ACH US LETTER IS PART OF AN OFFICRAL OF IOU PROCESSNT INITIATED BY BID IN LAST OCTOBER THE AFTHE A CONDUCTS THE ROF VIEW IT SENT TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUGGABUSE IN THE H  CHESS THE AHET JUST TRANSMENTS TH LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION TO THE D E EH THE WHITE HOUSE IS REFUSING TO COMMENT ON THER O VIEWU PROCESS SO THIS WILL LEAD TO A FEDERAL STATE CONFLICT BECAUE THE FEDERAL LOW HAS FAILED TO KEP UP WITH MASS OVE CHANGES OF THE PAST DECADES IN STATE CANAVAS LOST BY THE WAY S WORKED OUT BEAUTIFLLY FOR CALIFORNIA AND FOR STATES LIKE HOLERADA ERE DENVER IS NOW BASICALLY AN OPEN AIR DRUG MARKET SO THINGS ARE THINGS ARE WORKING OUT ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFULLY H CRIMINALIZATION OF MARIWANA IT MIGHTHAVE BEEN AN IDEA THAT WAS SUMERABLE FOR A TIME BUT THE THE EFFECTS OF IT HAVE BEEN PRETTY PRETTY BAD MEANWHILE DEMOCRATS CONTINUE TO USE CLIMATE CHANGE AS THERE EXCUSE FOR PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING SO THE GOVERNOR OF HAWA JOSH GREEN HE'S ASKED OUT WHETHER HAWIE'S ELECTRIC COMPANY HAD BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMPLETE DESTRUCTION OF LAHINAH WHICH IS ONE OF THE REAT TRAGEDIES OF MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY REALLY IS QUITE HORRIFYING AND IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT PROBABLY HOI ELECTRICTSIOR O SHUT DOWN THE ELECTRIC SUBSTATIONS AND THEY DIDN'T AND PROBABLY LED TO THIS FIRE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS GIANT GANT WINDSTORM AND A HE WAS LIKE WELL I'M NOT GON TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE POWER COMPANY BUD OM THE SUN GLOBAL WARMING HOW MUCH RESPONSIBILITY F YOU THINK THE POWER COMPANY BERE HERE FOR THE FIRE IT'S A VERY GOO QUESTION TO DAY THEN WHICH WAS ON THE TEN I ASK MY ATTORNEY GENERA L INSTRUCTED HER TO DO COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATIONS SO SHE'S DOING THAT RIGHT NOW SHE'S BROUGHT N OUTSIDE INVESTIGATOR IN I FROM THE MAINLAND THAT HAS FIRE EXPERT SEES SHE'S CAN FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH WE DO KNOW THAT THAT EARLY FIRE WAS SPARKE AS AS HE GOT SAID I DON'T LAT JUMP TA CONCLUSIONS JUST BECAUSE I DON'T THINK ITS FAIR FOR ME TO DO THAT BUT WE WILL HOLD EVERYONE ACCOUNTABLE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT AND WILL BE VERY TRANSPARENT ABOUT IT  RELEASE ALL THE REPORTS I THINK THAT IN THE END OF THE DAY WE ALL HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM IT WAS A VERY VERY HOT DRY TERRIBLE STORM WE ARE FEELING WITH LOBEL WARMING HERE WE HAD SIX TOTAL FIRE EMERGENCIES FROM NINETEEN FIFTY THREE TO TWO THOUSAND OF THREE AND THEN WE HAD SIX IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF THIS MONTH CAY SO ON IT'S THE IS TO GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CAR FOR BAD GOVERNMENTS IT TURNS OUT THE HUMAN BEINGS OF BEEN DEALING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS FOR LITERALLY ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY HOW YOU HANDLE THAT IS A GOOD MEASURE OF ARE YOU GOOD AT YOUR JOB OR NOT AND ON HE HANDLED THIS ABOUT OF BADLES YOU CAN HANDLE IT SOA GLOBEL WARMING IS THE PROBLEM OF COURSE MEANWHILE TROBIDIN DOING THE SAME  SACTROTINE IT SUCH A GET OUT OF JAIL FREECARD CLIMATE CHANGES NOW BASELY THE EXCUSE FOR EVERYTHING AND WE HANDLED THE DISASTER BADLY IN LAHEINOT WELL IT WAS CLIMATE CHANGE THE THE ECONOMY IS HAVING PROBINS WHELL THAT THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE TH THE WAR IS BREAKING OUT TH MITE IS CLIMATE CHANGE EVERYTING IS CLIMATE CHANGEIS IS THE IT'S THE ULTIMATE POLITICAL GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD WE STILL SOME DENIE SHA TERE THE TURMS YO O WORTHER NAN CLIMATES DOIT TI IS AND THE WORKAN NEED A WHOLL HE OP MORE MONEY TO DEAL WIS TO MERSE HERPRATIONS TO DEA IS TO ALL YOU TAKING CURE OH SO THE ANSWER IS A A LOP OR MONEY AND THAT I DIDN'T EE THAT COMING JROBIDN CALLING FOR MORE SPENDING ON THINGS NO NO BY THE WAY THE THE NOTION THAT HURRICANES ARE DRAMATICALLY CREATED BY THE GLOBE WARMING ISSUE THAT DATA IS NOT PARTICULARLY CLEAR AS BEORN LOMBURG POINTS OUT AND LANTIC HURRICANES ARE NOT BECOMENG MORE FREQUENT THE FREQUENCY OF HURRICANES MAKING LANDFALL IN THE CONTENTUAL UNITED STATES HAS TO CLINE SLIGHTLY SINCE NINETEEN HUNDRED AIRPLAINES IN SATELITES OF DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STORMS SCIENTISTS CAN SPOT AT S WHICH IS BY THE FREQUENCY OF LANDFALL HURRICANES RELIBELY TOK COMMEN TO BAC TO NINETEEN HUNDRED IS BETTER STAF THAN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ATLANTIC HURRICANES THERE ARE MORE POWERFUL HURRICANES EITHER THE FREQUENCY OF CAT THREE IN ABOVE HURRICANES MAKING LANDFALLSONCES NINETEEN HUNDRED IS TRENDING SLIGHTLY DOWN YOU HER A LOT ABOUT HURICANES GETTING STRONGER A STUDY IN THE JOURNAL OF NATURE FOUND THAT THE INCREASES ARE NOT PART OF THESE CENTURY SKELL INCREESE BUT A RECOVERY FROM A DEEP MINNIMUM IN THE SIXTIES THROUGH THE EIGHTIES SO YAP I IT'S IT'S ONCE AGAIN IT COMES DOWN TO GOVERNMENTS AN ABILITY TO GOVERNOOK A TIME FORCE SOME THINGS I LIKE AND SOME THINGS THAT I HATE SO TO DAY I BEGIN WITH A THING THAT I HATE BECAUSE THIS IS LEGITIMATELY ONE OF THE DUMMISTAKES I'VE EVER HEARD MY ENTIRE LIFE HERE IT IS IT COMES O CURTESY OF FARHEAD MAN JUE OF THE NEW AR TIMES WHO IS A RELIABLE A RELIABLE SOURCE FOR SOME THE DUMI STUY EVER HEARD KA AND HUNDI HELPS ENABLE A CRIMEWAY THAY SHOULD PAY FOR IT WAIT YOU ASK ARKIA AND HENDI HIRING G ANGS OF CRIMINALS TO STEAL

POLICE MORE ACTIVE POLICING MORE THROWING CRIMINALS IN THE JAIL AND LEAVING THEM IN THE JAIL I KNOW THIS IS LIKE SUPERBASIC STUFF BUT NOT APPARENTLY TO THESE MORONS SO I SLOW CLAP FOR FOR THAT GENIUS TAKE THERE THAT THAT IS SOME STRONG STUFF OK CA MEANWHILE LET'S GET TO A THING THAT I LIKE SO THINGS THAT I LIKE TODAY WHEN JOROGGEN HAD ON OLIVER ANTHONY HE'S THE GUY FROM A RICH MEN NORTH OF RICHMOND WHOS BECOMES FROM A NATIONAL PHENOMENON HE HIS SONG LED OFF THE FIRST REPUBLICAN DEBATE I HE SAYS HE'S OT A POLITICAL FIGURE WHICH IS PERFECTLY FINE I THING LIKE MOST AMERICANS HE RELAT USN'N FOLO POLITICS ALLTHAT CLOSELY BUT THAT HIS  GENERALIZED ANNOYANCE AND T LEAK CLASS THAT SEEKS TO CONTROL THE LIVES TO AMERICANS AND A IN USE ITS POWER TO REDISTRIBUTE AS HE SAYS FROM SORT O THE PRODUCTIVE TO THE UN PRODUCTIVE THAT IS INHERENTLY POLITICAL EVEN IF HE DOESN'T WISH IT TO BE A PARTISAN ISSUE I WEL  WAS FASCINATING TO WATCH HIM ON ROGAN BECAUSE AS A A SORT OF BLUE COLLAR DUED KE WAS ABLE TO SAY SOME THINGS TO TO JOE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR NOW NOW I'VE QUOTED TE BIBLE TO TO MY FRIEND JOROGGAN BEFORE IT HAS HAVING A DIVERENIMPACK WHEN COME FROM OLIVER ANTHONHE HEAR IS OLIVER ANTHONY ON WITH JOROGAN YESTERDAY YOU KNOW LIKE THERE'S THERE'S THINGS IT SI SLIKE  AND I'L BE VERY BRIEF R THIS A PROMISE BUT LIKE ONE THING IRONICALLY IT'S A PROVERBS FOR TWENTY WHICH I THOUGHT CERE THIS ANYTHING BETTER IT RAM PRIST MY SON PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT I SAY TURN YOUR EAR TO MY WORDS DO NOT LET THEM OUT O YOUR SIGHT KEEP THEM WITHIN YOUR HEART FOR THEY ARE LIFE TO THOSE WHO FIND THEM AND HEALTH THE ONE'S WHOLE BODY ABOVE ALL ELSE GUARD YOUR HEART FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO FLOWS FROM IT KEEP YOUR MOUTH FREE FROM PERVERSITY KEEP CORRUPT TALK FAR FROM YOUR LIPS LET YOUR EYES LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD FIX YOUR GAZE DIRECTLY BEFORE YOU GIVE CAREFUL THOUGHT TO THE PATH FOR YOUR FEET AND BE STEADFAST IN ALL YOUR WAYS DO NOT TURN TO THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT KEEP YOUR FOOT FROM EVIL BUT OM THIT'S PRETTY  PROFOUND BUT THE WHOLE BOOK OF PROVERBS IS LIKE THAT LIKE IT'S NOT PRECIIT'S NOT IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK LIKE IT'S IT'S LIKE IT'S GOOD GUIDANCE IS LIKE GOOD GUIDANCE THAT YOU WOULD WANT A FATHER TO GIVE TO THIS SON GOOD FOR ALIVER ANTHONY AGAIN THIS IS THE PART OF AMERICAN LIFE AND HE TELLS THE STORY BY THEWAY AND HIS STORIES RALLY FASCINATING CAS HE BASICALLY SAYS THAT HE WAS KE WAS INVOLVED IN DRUG USE AND HE WAS INVOLVED AN ALCOHOL USE AND HO'S VUSILY FALLING APART IN YOUR SUICIDE AND AND THEN HE DISCOVERED RELIGION AND JUST LIKE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE DISCOVERED RELIGION OVER THE COURSE OF RELIGIOUS HISTORY KE THEN FOUND INSPIRATION THERE AND WITHIN SIX MONTHS HE WAS WRITING SONGS THAT PEOPLE WANTED TO HEAR AND BASICALLY HIS SONG IS TO PLEAD FOR LEAVE ME ALONE AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT IS LIKE LET THESE PEOPLE NOT BOTHER ME AND LET ME LIVE MY LIFE IN CONTONENCE WITH WALKING IN THE WAYS OF GOD THIS IS THE WAY THAT AMERICA USED TO WORK AND AND THE FACT THAT I IT IS KIND OF INCREDIBLE HOW BASIC MESSAGES LIKE I'MS LIKE THE BOOK OF PROVERBS IS KIND OF AN OLD BOOK AND IT'S FAMILIAR TO MANY OF US AND IN'S MISHLI IN IN HEBREW LIKE IT'S BEEN AMOUND FOR SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS AND THE FACT THAT USED TO BE THE THE SENTENCES THAT OLIVER ANTHONY IS READING THARE THESE USED TO BE THE KINDS OF SENTENCE IS THAT PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY IN AMERICA HAD IT TO THEIR TONGUE YOUCOULD BASICALLY QUOTE THE BOOK OF JUTERONOMY AND IT WOULD BE A COMMON POINT OF OF REFERENCE IN THE SAME WAY THAT IN BRITAN YOU COULD QUOTE SHAKESPEARE KNOWS A COMMON POINT OF REFERENCE THE BIBLE WAS THE TAX THAT EVERYBODY USED FOR LITERALLY CENTURIES THE TAXT THAT WAS FOR MANY PEOPLE THE ONLY TEXT THEY KNEW WAS THE BIBLE THERE IS A REASON WHY THE THE MOST PRINTED BOOK IN HUMAN HISTORY IS THE BIBLE AND NOW IF YOU SPEAKS LIKE A REGULAR PERSON ON THE STREET AND YOU QUOTE THE BIBLE THEY DON'T KNOW A DAMN THING ABOUT IT AND THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM BECAUSE THE BIBLE DOES CARRY WITH IT A SET OF VALUES IT IS NOT JUST A BUNCH OF VAGUE STANDARDS THAT ARE UNIMPLEMENTABLE IN YOUR DAILY LIFE AS IT SAYS IN TH BOOK OF GUTERONOMY IT IS NOT FAR FROM YOU IT IS CLOSE TO YOU IN YOUR MOUTH WRITING THAT THIS THE THE BASIC NOTION THAT THE MORALITY OF THE BIBLE IS AVAILABLE TO EVERY ONE AND THAT IT'S ACTUALLY FAIRLY UNDERSTANDABLE AND VAIRLY CLEAR AND THE PROVIDES TO BASIC GUIDE TO LIFE LIKE THIS WAS THE THING THAT FELL AWAY IN FAVOR OF ITS NOTION THT YOU CAN DEFINE YOUR OWN VALUE SYSTEM IN THAT JUST FOLLOW YOUR STARS FOLLOW WHAT YOU FEEL IN YOUR HEART FOLLOW THAT THAT IS NOT WHAT THE BIBLE IS SAYING THAT'S NOT WHAT PROVERBS IS SAYING AND OLIVER ANTHONY WHEN HE MOVE FROM LIVING IN ONE WAY TO A BIBLICAL WAY OF LIVING IMPROVED HIS LIFE FAIRLY DRAMATICALLY THE BIBLE IS STILL THE GREATEST SELF HELP BOOK EVER WRITTEN BECAUSE IT ISN'T ABOUT YOU THAT THE WHOLE POINT OF SELF HELP IS THAT IT REALLY ISN'T ABOUT YOUS THAT YOU ORIENTING OUTSIDE YOURSELF YOU CAN'T HELP YOURSELF IF YOU'R ORIENTAD TOWARD YOURSELF YOU'RE THE PROBLEM AND WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY WHERE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SAY TO PEOPLE THAT THAT THEY ARE THE PROBLEM WITH THEIR OWN LIFE BUT THE TRUTH IS NINETY FIE PERCENT OF THE PROBLES ING YOUR LIFE ARE YOU PROBLEMS MEAN THAT THE PROMISE THAT YOU CAN SOLVE OR THAT YOU HAVE TO HANDLE AND THAT IN HANDLING YOUR LIFE GETS BETTER THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT HORRIBLE THINGS DON'T HAPPEN IN PEOPLE FINANCIALLY HELTH LIFE OF COURSE HORRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN TO PEOPLE BUT THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN SOLVE THOSE KIND OF PROMISING RELIFH OUR ARMY FIXING THE EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCE IS BY HOW YOU APPROACH THAT PROBLEM THER'S APPOING THAT VICTOR FRANKL MAKES EVEN WITH REGARD OF THE HOLICOS HE SAYS EVEN WHEN YOU ARE PUT IN LITERALLY THE WORSE SITUATION THAT HUMAN BEING CAM PUT INTO IT IS YOUR MEASURE OF AUTONOMY IN DEALING WITH THAT SITUATION THAT MAKES YOU HUMAN BEING THAT'S WHAT PIBLICAL VALLUYS USED TO TEACH AND IT USED TO BE IN GRAIN FROM THE TIME THA YOU WERE VERY VERY YOUNG THERE'S SOME PEOPLE WHO LEAD THAT SORT OF LIFE INSTINCTIVELY LIKE JOE IS NOT A BIBLICAL LIVER BUT JOE IS THE KIND OF PERSON WHO APPROACH HIS LIFE THAT WAY LIKE IFYOU UCTUALLY NO JOE I'M FRIENDS WITH JOE THAT THE WAY THAT YOU APPROACHES HIS OWN LIFE IS IN THIS WAY ISTHAT HOW CAN I HELP MYSELF HOW TO I SOLVE THE PROBLEM NOT HOWDO I BLAME SOMEBODY ELSE YOU THEN COMES AND SOLVES THE PROBLEM FOR ME ONE OFTHEY PROMISE THEIR POLITICS IS JUST THAT EVERY'S WAITING FOR THE DAYOSEC MACCANA RE'S WAITING FOR SOMEBODY COME ALONG AND SOLVE ALL THE PROBEMS FOR THEM AND THE POLITICIANS WHARE THOSE POPULAR ARE THE PIE PIPERS WHO SAVE THIS KIND OF STUFF WELL I WILL SOLVE YOUR PROBISE I WILL COME IN WITH TH POWER GOVERMENT I WILL FIX EVERYTHING BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE THEY CAN'T DO THAT EVERY'SLOOKING AS I SEIT ON TWITTER TO DAY EVER I'S LOOKING FOR THE DAUS EXMACANAMEING THE GOD OUTSIDE THE MACHINE THERE US TO BE SOMETHING IN GREEK THEATERE WHERE BASICALLY THE WRITER WOULD RUN INTO A PROBLE OF HIS OWN MAKING THEY COULDN'T FIX AND SUDDENLY A GOD WOULD ARRIVE FROM LIKE THE RAFTERS LIKE APOLLA WHICH A SHOW OP AND BOOM FIX THE PROBM THAT WAS DAVS EX MACKAN OUT RIGHT WATS THE GOD IN THE OUTSIDE THE MACHINE THATWAS CAN FIX EVERYTHING WELL INSTEAD OF LOOKING BUT BUT NOW WE'VE BASICALLY ATTRIBUTED THOSE KIND OF POWERS TO OUR LEAT AND THEN WERE SURPRISE WHEN THE CAN FULFILIT HOW BOUTN'T STOP INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR A DAUSEX MACANAM TO FIX EVERYTHING OR A MIRACLE THO FIX EVERYTING HOW ABOUT WE ACTUALLY LOOK TO YOU KNOW THE SET OF VALUES THT BUILT THE CIVILIZATION THAT WE HAVE GARNERED ALL BENEFIT FROM WHILE GIVING VERY LITTLE BACK HOABOUT THAT THAT WOULD BE THE THING THAT ACTION MAKES MA DIFFERENCE IT WAS IT WAS A PRETTY FASCINATING APPEARANCE AT ROGUEAN ALSO ON DURING THIS APPEARANCE WENT AFTER RAIN WILSON RAIN WILSON HAD GONE AFTER OLIVER ANTHONY AND HERE WAS A JOE GOING AFTER RAINWILSON IN RETURNED IT'S IT'S A SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION SO LIKE EVERYBODY IS GETTING INVOLVED AND AND SOMEHOW ANOTHER BECAME CULTURAL AND THEN THERE IS A DWITE FROM THE OFFICE OH YEH ICHIVE I IT IF HE GET A RIT ACULTURAL AND THE WOULD IT E SAY SOMETHING LIKE YOU WOULDN'T WRITE ABOUT OVER WA PEOPLE ON WELFARE HEU WOULD RIDE ABOUT BILLIONAIRES IN THEIR TAXES YEH THERE'S NOTHING FUNNIER THEN MILLIONAIRES TALKIT HA HA HA HA  THERE'S S NOTHIN FUNNY FUNNIER ABOUT MILLIONAIRES PRETENDING THESE BMILLIONAIRES ARE OUT ATA TAIE YOU NO TAKE TAKE DELIGHT FROM THE OFFICE DOWN THO WEST VIRGENIA NOW TAKE EM TAKE M THROUGH THOSE COAL MINING COUNTRIES TAKE EM THROUGH THOSE PLACES IN APPALATIA WERE PEOPLE OF EXTREME POVERTY YOAVE IN PILLS OF RAVISHED THOSE AREAS TAKE EM TO THERE HE'S NOT WRONG ABOUT ANY OF THAT BUT BUT THE KEY THERE IS THAT IF YOU DON'T WANT TALK DOWN TO PEOPLE WHO YOURAIN WILSON I WANT TO TALK DOWN TO PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING APPALACHA AND IN POVERTY THEN DON'T TALK DOWN TO THEM MEANING THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS WITH EQUAL WORTH AND EQUAL MERIT IN GOD'S VIEW AS AS JUST HUMAN BEINGS  THTTHERE CAN T HAVE TO EARN THERE CANO HAVE TO EARN YOU THERE THEY'RE GOOD IN FRONT OF GOD BUT THE IDEA THAT THAT THEY ARE OF EQUAL GODLY WORTH THAT THAT OF COURSE BASIC LILICAL VAL WHICH ALSO MEANS THEY'VE EQUAL  RESPONSIBILITY IS RESPONSIBILITY THAT THAT HAS FALLEN AWAY HERE THE ALVERANTHONY APPEARANCE ON ROGGUEN IS DEFINITELY WORTH THE WATCH IF SHE SPEND SOME TIME WITH IT IT'S

STAGNATING IN THE POLES JOBIDON TURNS TO THE RACE CARD TO TRY TO GET OUT HIS POLITICAL FUNG THE LEFT CON SIDERS ANOTHER ROUND OF COVERED CRAZINESS AND DOAL TRUMPS GANUARY SIX TRIAL DATE IS SET FOR THE DAY BEFORE SUPER TUESDAY I'M BEEN SPERE OF THE SIS VENTUPURO SHO TACHOSPONSERBACKSPESSPE PIAN THOUSANDS O MY LITERS HAV ALREADY SECURED THE NETRICKDAY TO JOIN THEM EXPRESSPE PIANTI CALUM SLESHMON SO PEOPLE REALLY REALLY REALLY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN A JOBID IN DONALD TRUMP MATCH UP FOR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR BY EVERY AVAILABLE PULE AND YET THAT IS LIKEGLY BEYOND LIKELY AT THIS ONT TO BE THE ACTUAL MATCHUP GOING INTO THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ELECTION AND BY THE POLLING DAT U PEOPLE REALLY DON'T LIKE EITHER ONE OF THESE CANDIDATES ACCORDING TO THE ASSOCIATEOR PRESSE PRESIDENT JOBIDON IS OLD AND CONFUSED FORM PRESIDENT DONAL TRUMP IS CORRUPT AND DISHONEST THOSE ARE AMONG THE TOP TURMS AMERICANS USE WHEN THEY ASKED TO DESCRIBE THE DEMOCRAT IN THE WITE HOUSE AND ARE PUBLICANS BEST POSITION TO FACE HIM IN NEXT YEAR'S ELECTION THE ZENUWPOOLL  POLE FROM THE ASSOCIATE PRESS AND ARCEY CENTER FOR PUBLIC AFFAIRS RECEARCH FOR BIDON OF LARGES SHARE OF UUSIDELLS MENTIONED HIS AGE AT EIGHTY BIDON JUST THREE YEARS OLDER THAN TRUMPETY ALSO LOOKS LIKE HES HALF DEAD TRUMP MEANWHILE HAS BEEN ELICITING WORDS AT LIKE CORRUPT AND CROOKED FIFTEEN BYKE FIFTEEN PER CENT BAD ANDOTHER NEGATIVE COMMENTS ABOUT ELEVIN PER CENTS LIR AN DISHONEST EIGHT PER CENT BOUT EIGHT PER CENT OFFERED GENERALLY POSITIVE COMMENTS LIKE GOOD SO THE GENERAL BREAK DOWN HERE IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO JOBIDON TWENTY SIX PER CENT A RESPONDENCE USE WORDS LIKE OLD OR OUTDATED TO DESCRIBED BIDON ANOTHER FIFTEEN PER CENT MENTION THINGS LIKE SLOW OR CONFUSED ANOTHER TEN PER CENTS GAVE GENERALLY NEGATIVE COMMENTS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT SIX PER CENT USED WORDS LIKE CORRUPT AND CROOKED ONLY SIX PER CENT OFFERED WORDS LIKE PRESIDENT AND LEADER AND FIVE PER CENT LIKE STRONG AND CAPABLE EVEN AMONG DEMOCRATS TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT MENTIONED HIS AGE SIGNIFICANTLY HIRE THAN LEADERSHIP OR STRENGTH AND CAPABILITY TRUMPS NEGATIVE COMMENTS ACCORDING TO THE APY SENT ARE NOT ON EGE UT ON HIS MORAL STANDING AND CONDUCT ALONG WITH THINGS LIKE LOUD MOUTH WHICH WAS SIX PER CENT AND ANGR CRAZY AND DANGEROUS SIX PER CENT NARCICIST SIX PER CENT FIVE PER CENT USED WORDS LIKE STRONG AND CAPABLE SIXTY TWO PER CENT OF AMERICAN SAY THY'VE AN UNFAVORABLE OPINION OF TRUMP WHICH IS NOT A GOOD RECIPE FLINNINGAN ELECTION FIFTY TWO PER CENT  SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT JOBIDON ALSO NOT IN A MAZING STAP FOR WINING AN ELECTION SO ONCE AGAIN WE ARE GOING TO RUN A COUPLE OF VERY VERY UNPOPULAR PEOPLE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN THE ODD BELIEF BY BOTH SIDES THAT THE OTHER GUI IS WAYMORE UNPOPULAR THAN THEIR OWN GUY AND THEREFORE YOUR OWN GUY REALLY DOEN'T MATTER AND YOU CANNOT LOSE LUT HERE IS THE PROBLEM FOR JOBIDON JOBIDEN CANDLERS SO IF JOBIDON WERE SOMEHOW TO LOSE TO DONALD TRUMP IT WOULD BE THE SINGLE WORST DEFEAT FOR DEMOCRATS OF MY LIFE TIN AND WORSE THAN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN TRUMPY TILLERY CLINTON BECAUSE NOBODY AFTILY THOUGHT TRUMPLES GAN A WIN THAT ONE BUT NOW EVERODY UNDERSTANDS THE TRUMP CAN WIN THAT ONE SO BIDON SOMEHOW LOSES TO DONALD TRUMP POST JANUARY SIX POST IS TWENTY TWENTY TEFEET POST ALL THE REST OF THE STUFF THERE BE THE SINGLE MOST HUMILIATING DEFEAT FOR DEMOCRATS IN MY LIFE TIME AND PROBABLY EVER WHICH MEANS THAT JOBIDONS IN A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE CAREIMAN IF YOU LOOK AT THE REAL CLER POLITICS PULLING AVERAGE IN THE TRUMP VERSES BIDON RACE AND AGAIN IT'S VERY EARLY SOT'S NOT AS THOUGH IT IS DEFINITELY CAN BE TRUM FOR SO BIDON BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK IT THE FRUMT RUNNERS FOR BOT PARTIES RIGHT NOW RIGHT NOW JOBIDON IN THE REAL COPALSIC POLLING AVERAGES OF JUST ONE PER CENTAGE POINT JUST ONE ACCORDING TO EMERSON TRUMP IS ACTUALLY UP TWO POINTS FORTY SIX TO FORTY FOUR NOW DO I BELIEVE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE THAT CLOSE I DON'T THE REASON BEING WHEN YOU LOOK UNDER THE TOP LINE OF THESE STAFFS VERY OFTEN WHAT YOUR SEEING FOR EXAMPLEERS STAT YESTERDAY CAME OUT THAT SJOWD JOBIDING TOR SIXTY ONE PER CENT MY NORTY SUPPORT THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE THE ACTUAL NUMBER WHEN THE ELECTION COMES ROUND NO DEMOCRAT HAS WON LESS THAN SEVENTY PER CENT OF MINORITY  SUPPORT FOR PROBABLY FOUR DECADES BUT WITH THAT SAT IS A SELECTION TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT FOR JOBIDON YOUBAT  CREEN JOHN PER WAS ASKED ABOUT THIS POING THAT I SHOWING THAT EVEN DEMOCRATS TO THINK THAT JOBIDON IS OLD SLOW AND NOT WITH IT HERE IS HER ANSWER ER WE OU JA WULL I PRECATE THE QUESTION I GET I GET IT OFTEN AS YOU KNOW UM AND TOE WHAT I WOULD SAYIND I SEND TOS MANY TIMES AN MANY OF MY COLLGES AP SENT THIS THE PRESIDENT SAYS THIS IF YOU WATCH HIM IF YOU SEEN WHER HE'S DOWN E LAST TWO YEARS THIS IS THE PRESIDENT HAS HAD A HISTORIC ADMINISTRATION IN JUST TWO YEARS IF SHE LOOK CANT THE THIRTEEN POI THIRTEEN POIN TIME WHEN THE THIRTEEN POIN CIMOMILION JOBS THAT HE'S BEEN ABLE TO CREATE IF YOU LOOK AT HOW HE'S BEEN ABLE TO TURN THE ECONOMY AROUNDST AT IT WORKS FROR MIDTLE CLASS AMERICANS YET SO AVOID THE QUESTION AVOID THE QUESTIONCAUSE SHE CAN'T SAY HE'S OBVIOUSLY VIGOROUS S THAT'S OBVIOUSLY UNTRUE BUT SHE'S POINTING TO QUON QUOTE THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS WELL THE TRUTH IS THAT THAT'SKIN THE MATTER AS MUCH FOR JOBIDON AS DONALD TRUMP'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS MATTERED FOR HIM IN TWENTY TWENTY DONALD TRUMP COULD AVE POINTED TO ALL THE AMAZSING THINGS DID OVER THE COURSE OF THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION BEFORE TWENTY TWENTY AND HE DID SOME OF THAT BUT IN THE END PEOPLE YOUBASICALLY VOTED IN A ROUGH RANDAM ONDONALD TRUMP AS A HUMAN AND THE SAME THING IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO JOBIDON AND WHILE SHE'S OUT THERE SAYING THAT JOBIDONIS WITH IT EVERYTHING IS FINE JOBID IS LIKE COUGHING INTO HIS HANDS AND SHAKING HANDS WITH PEOPLE AND GETING WEIRDLY CLOSE WITH TEEN AJERS IN BEING JGENERAL LIES ELDERLY WEIRDO COUKING IN  HIS HANDS S CAUKINOER ANOER ANOVER I MANAGE S KEEPS SI YOU KNOW SHAKIN HANDS WITH THE FOLKS

THE MDDLE OF IT RIGHT NOW ORE ABOUT TO HITS IN JUST A FEW DAYS ALL OF THIS SO NONE OF THIS IS VERY GOOD FOR JOBIDON AND SO HE IS PULLING OUT SOME OLD STAND BYS STRETEGICALLY SPEAKING WL GET TO THAT MOMENTARILY FIRST YOU'VE PROBABLY TE HAD A HARD GO OF IT IF YOUA BIT OFSPALL BUSINESS OWNER SINCE COVEENT IT'S BEEN PRETTY ROUGH M BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND STAKE GOVERNMENTS SHUTTING YOU

CANDIDATE DEMOCRATS GO BACK TO THE WELL AND IN THAT PLAY BOOK OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THEY'VE HAD TWO BIG PLAYES PLAY NUMBER ONE ALL OF OUR OPONENTS AUR RACIS SO THEY'RE NOW ATTEMPTING TO USE THIS PLAYBOOK WITH REGARD TO THIS HERRIFIC SHOOTING IN JACKSONVILL WHERE A A PERSON WOAS ON LIKE A SEVENTY TO HOUR MENTAL HOLD A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO SO OVY SOMEBODY WITH WITH SOME PRETE SIGNIFICANT EMOTSIONAL PROBLEMS AND ALSO HAPPEN TO BE A NEONATZY I PUT A BUNCH OF SUASTACAS ON HIS GUN AND THEN WENT TO A DOLLAR GENERAL AND SHOT THREE BLACK PEOPLE HORRIFYING STORY RONDASANTIS SHOWED UP IN TOWN IN ORDER TO PAY TRIBUTE TO THOSE PEOPLE AND PLEDGE TO HELP OUT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AND ALL OF THE REST AND THE DEMOCRATS AN IMMEDIATE IMMEDIATELY SPONTISON TO GET ANOTHER STORY OF EVIL REPUBLICAN

AND A CROSS THE NATION SAY THEI'R OUTRAGE BY HIS ACTIONS AND REDRIC AHEAD OF THE SHOOTING MY STORY WITH BRENDON FARRINGTON O GET THIS ABSURD COVERAGE THAT'S ABSURD COVERAGE SO BECAUSE RONDO SANTIS AND

APPARENTLY THERE IS A NEONAZY WHO  SHOT THREE BLACK PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA AND RONDISSANTIS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT ACCORDING TO STEVE PEOPLES AND THE ASSOCIATED PRESS WHICH IS AN INSANE TAKE BUT AT ALL IT IS ALSO THE TAKE THAT  DEMOCRATS ARE GOING S ARE USING SO HERE IS THE ENDOBLACY P JACKSONVILLE PRESIDENT I SAY A RUMLIN SAYING THAT DOM THE WHITESO PREMISYAN FLORTA IS PALPABLE THAT'S WAY

SELLING LIKE CATLETER IU THEY GE WHAT WHAT COME ON AMMINED EM HE'S RIDICULOUS RIDICULOUS GRAPLIC HE SPEAKING OF OTHER RIDICULOUS CRAP O POPE FRANCIS A TERRIBLE POPE SO JUSTCON PUT THAT OUT THERE HE'S REALLY BAD ATHE POPING NOW IDO'T HAVE ANY STAKE OBVIOUSLY IN NUM IN THE CATHOLIC DOCTRINE OF OF POPE FRANCIS A'S BIG FAN OF BENEDIC I THOUGHT BENDIC WAS AN EXCELLENT POPE BECAUSE I DO HAVE A STAKE AS A CITIZEN OF THE WESTERN WORLD IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH ACTUALLY STANDING TRUE TO ITS HISTORIC RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES WHEN IT COMES TO MORALITY AND ETHICS BECAUSE THE'VE SHAPED BILLIONS OF PEOPLE OVER THE COURSE OF HISTORY POPE FRANCIS IS A LIBERATION THEOLOGIST PRETTY OBVIOUSLY HE HE IS A HE IS A PERSON WITH A MARKS IST ORIENTATION TOWARD ECONOMICS AND A REAL AA REAL DISTAIN FOR SERVE TRADITIONAL CATHOLICISM INTROMS THE SOCIAL AREAS I MEAN I CAN'T TELL YO HAMMI TIMES AT THIS POINT POPE FRANCIS HAS SAID SOMETHING THAT IS INVIOLATION OF CHURCH DOCTRINE HISTORICALLY WITH REGARD TO SAY DIVORCE OR GAY MARRIAGE OR ANY OF THAT SORT OF STUFF AND THEN HIS TEAM COMES O ALLHUSMIS INTERPRETED JUST DON'T SPEAK ITALIAN WELL WELL AT A CERTAIN POINT YOU GOT TO A MANSION THAT MAYBE HE'S JUST THE GUY WE ALL KINTHINK HE IS WHICH IS LEITHE LEFT IS VERY WARM TOWARD POPE FRANCE TO MADE A COUPLE OF BIG BOOBOOS OVER THE LAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS SO FIRST HE A WAS SPEAKING BY VIDIO TO A GATHERING OF ROMAN CATHOLIC USE IN SAINT PETERSBURG AND HE URGE THEM TO FOLLOW IN THE CATH OF PETER F THE GREAT AND CATHERINE THE GREAT WHOM HE CALLES RULERS OF A GREAT EN LIGHTENED EMPIRE OF GREAT CULTURE AND GREAT HUMANITY WHICH IS A WEIRD TAKE SINCE BOTH PETER AND CATHERINE WERE W IOLD TERRITORIAL EXPANSIONISTS IT IS WHAT THEY ARE KNOWN FOR AND THEY ARE ALSO THE TWO FIGURES THAT GLADMER PUTTIN MOST SIGHTS AS SORT OF HISTORICAL INSPIRATIONS FOR HIS TERRITORIAL AGGRESSIONS THIS OF COURSE HAS TICKED OFF PRETT MUCH EVERYBODY IN U GRAIN OLEG NICOLENKE IS POKESMEN FOR THE UCRANIAN FOR MINISTRY CALLE THE POPESWORDS INPERIALIST PROPAGANDA OF THE KIND THE CKREMLAN USES TO JUSTIFIGHTS INVASION OF U CRANCROPE IT IS A SHAME THAT RUSSIAN GREAT COWER IDEAS WHICH ARE ACTUALLY THE CAUSE OF RUSSIA'S CHRONIC AGGRESSIVENISS ARE VOICT KNOWING THEY'RE NOT BY THE POPE THE LEADER OF THEU CRANE'S GREEK CATHOLIC CHURCH MAJOR ARC BISHOP 'S THE OTALOV SHEV CHUCK SENDIN A STATEMENT THE POPESWORSE HAD CAUSED GREAT PAIN IN THE CHURCH HIERARCHY AND GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT IN YOU CRANIAN  CIVIL SOCIETY THE POPE'S REMARKS DREW ANGRY REACTIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF SOURCES AND THEN THE AND THEN OF COURSE THE VAD CAN TRYED TO WALK IT BACK AS THEY'VE HAD TO DO WITH WITH POPE FRANCIS MULTIPLETIMES THE REJECTED SUGGESTIONS THE POPE FRANCES MIGHTHAVE ENCOURAGED YOUNG RUSSIAN CATHOLICS TO DRAW INSPIRATION FROM HISTORICAL RUSSIAN FIGURES KNOWN FOR IMPERIALISTIC AND EXPANSIONIST IDEAS AND ACTIONS THE NEGATIVELY IMPACT TED EIGHBORING POPULATIONS INCLUDING E UCRANIAN PEOPLE FRANCIS HAS HAD TO CRIDUCRANN SUTHERING PUT HE IS NOT CONDEMN MOSCOWTH FOR THE WAR O'S BEEN VERY CAREFUL NOT TO CONDEMN MOSCOW FOR THE WAR AND BY THE WAY IT IS IT IS WORTH WHILE NOTING THAT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITHTHE CATHOLIC CHURCH WAS PRETTY FRAUT PETER THE GREAT HIS RELATIONSHIP I TH CATHOLIC CHURCH WAS ACTUALLY FAIRLY FRAUGHT IT WAS NOT THE EASIEST RELATIONSHIP SO THAT IS BOUBONUMBER ONE FOR THE POPE WHO WERE NUMBER TOO IS THAT APPARENTLY THE POPE HAS NOW BLASTED THE QUOTE BACKWARDNESS OF SOME CONSERVATIVES IN THE US CATHOLIC CHURCH SAYING THEY HAVE REPLACED FAITH WITH IDEOLOGY HE'S WANT TO TALK MEANSERIOUSLY ONESTOGOD YOUON TALK ABOUT A POPE WHO HAS REPLACED FAITH WITH IDEOLIOGY HE HEVES WRITING IN SICLICALS ABOUT HOW WE HAVE TO STOP HURTING MOTHER EARTH WHILE THE SAME TIME PROCLAIMING THE DOCTRINE OF SOCIAL LIBERALISM IN VERY SOFT FORM FRANCIS COMMONS WERE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE DIVISIONS IN TH US CATHOLIC CHURCH WHICH HAS BEEN SLIP BETWEEN PROGRESSIS IN CON SERVATIVES WHO LONG FOUND SUPPORT IN THE DOCTRIN ARE PAPERS PAPACIES OF SAINT JOHN PAUL THE SECOND AND BENEDICTS THE SIXTEEN PARTICULA ANISH IS ABORTION AN SAN SEXPERLY EVEN THE APENOS LIKE YA CONSERTIVES LIKE PO PAUL JOHN PAULTO AND BENEDICT SIXTEEN THE ARE LIKE THOSE GUISE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY ACTUALLY HEWED TO HISTORIC CATHOLIC DOCTRON ON MORALITY THIS GUY HE'S CREATIVE WHEN YOUR BARAKABAMA'S FAVORITE POPE THEIRS SOMETHING WRONG MANY CONSERTIVES OF BLASTED FRANCIS EMPHIS ON SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES SUCH AS THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE POOR WHILE BRANDING HERETICAL HIS OPENING TO LETTING IT DIVORSE AN CIVILLY REMARRIED CATHOLICS RECEIVE THE SACRAMENTS WHICH AM YOU KNOW THAT USED TO BE CALLED JUST THE DOCTRINE SO DURING A MEETING A PORTUGUESE JESUIT TOLD FRANCIS HE HAD SUFFERED DURING A RECENT SPATICAL YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES TBECAUSE HE CAME A CROSS MANY CATHOLICS INCLUDING SOME YUST BISHOPS WHO CRITICIZED FRANC'S TENOR PAPACY AS TO DAY AS WELL AS IT IS JESUITS THE EIGHTY SIXTRALD ARCHENTENE ACKNOWLEDGIS POINTSAING THERE IS A VERY STRONG ORGANIZED REACTIONARY ATTITUDE IN THE UST CHURCH WHICH HE CALLED BACKWARD HE SAID DOING THIS YOU LOSE THE TRUE TRADISION YOU TURN TO IDEOLOGIES TO HAVH SUPPORT IN OTHER WORDS IDEOLOGIES REPLACE FAITH THE VISION OF THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHURCH AS AMONALIST IS WRONG WHEN YOU GO BACKWARD YOU MAKE SOMETHING CLOSED OFF THIS CONNECTED FROM THE ROOTS OF THE CHURCH WAIT HOLD ON WHEN YOU  GO BACKWARDS YOU'RE DISCONNECTING FROM TH OOTS OF THE CHURCH I NORISE THAT WHEN YOU'RE REFLECTING THE POLITICAL PRIORITIES OF FAR LEFT FIGURES IN LATIN AMERICA AS WELL AS THE UNITED STATES YOU MIGHT BE MOVING AWAY FROM THE ROOTES OF THE CHURCH HE SAYS I WONCE REMIND THESE PEOPLE BACKWARDNESS IS USELESS I GOT AT TELL YOU LIKE FOR THE POPE TO SAY WHEN S HIS BACKWARDNESS I SUME WHAT HE MEANS IS YOU KNOW THE HISTORY OF HIS CHURCH WHICH HIS SUPPOSED TO BE THE ROCK OF FAITH CORRECT AGAIN NOT A CATHOLIC BUT PRETTY SURE THAT'S WHAT IT IS THEY MUST UNDERSTAND THERE'S A CORRECT EVOLUTION IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF QUESTIONS AND FAITH AND MORALS OH INTERESTING THERE'S A CORRECT EVOLUTION IN FAITH AND MORALS WHICH IS I'M WHICH IS THAT HELSE SID WAS AN HONOR TO BE ATTACKED BY AMERICANS AT SOME POINT SO YAH I'M YOU BY BY THE WAY WORTH NOTING THE ONLY SAGMENTS OF CATHALISISM ON PLANED EARTH THAT ARE GROWING RIGHT NOW I'RE NOT LEFT LEANING CATHOLIC CHURCHES THEY'RE ALL RIGHT LEANING CATHOLIC CHURCHES THEY'RE PEOPLE ARE TRADITIONALIST IT'S THE LATIN MASS  CATHOLIC CHURCHES THEY'RE STILL FULL IT'S THE ONE SOAR O'RE MOVING SOFTLY TOWARD EMBRACING THE POPES OWN SOFT EMBRACE OF SOCIAL LEFTISM

SOMEWHERE IN NEW YORK OR PEOPLE SIT DOWN EVERY DAN TAL CAY WE CAN'T SAY MOTHER NOW WE HAVE THEY BURTHING PERSON GET THAT OON THE WIRE RIGHT NOW WHO'S MAKING THESE RULES I DON'T GET IT SO VAMPIRE IS

THINGS IN AN OWNERSHIP THAT IS RATIONAL THAT'S FINE THEY'VE A BRAN DISAGREEMENT AND THEY'R WILLING TO A MAKE THAT BRANDISGRM EN PUBLIC BUT HE IS SAYING STUFF THAT IS SO PERFECTLY OBVIOUS TO ANYONE WITH THE FUNCTIONAL BRAIN THAT IT IS BEYOND DISPUTE THE FACT THAT IT' EVEN REMOTE THE CONTRVERSIAL INTODASDAN AGE IS ABSURD O KAY OTHER THINGS THAT I HATE SO I JKE TAPPER DIDN NEA OR YIOUTH CHRIST CRISTY THE OTHER DAY AND CHRISTY HAS BEEN RIPPING ON OTHER REPUBLICANS FOR SAYING THAT NAY BINARY ELECTION BETWEEN BIDON AND TRUMP THEY WOULD VOTE FOR TRUMP AND TAPPER THEN ASKED HIM A QUESTION THAT S IM A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE LEFT LEANING MEDIA ARE CONSTANTLY ASKING WHICH IS TWO RE PUBLICANS HAVE AN AUTHORITARIAN PROBNOW LET ME FIRST EXPLAIN AUTHORITARIANISM IS NOT WITH WHAT PEOPLE LEFT ME TO THINK IT IS THEY THINK AUTHORITARIANISM IS LIKE DONAL FROM TWEETING THINGS OR DONAL TRUM MAKING EFFORTS THAT ARE THEN STEIBED TO CHANGE THE RESULTS OF AN ELECTION THEY'RE MANY FORMS OF AUTHORITARIANISM IN FACT FASHISM IS AN ELEMENT OF BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT IT IS NOT MERELY A RIGHT WINGED THING AUTHORITARIANISM CAN JUST AS HE EASILY BE DONE BY SERIES OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT GO OUTSIDE THE CONSTITUTION RADICALLY RESHIFT THE BALANCE BETWEEN PEOPLE IND THEIR GOVERNMENT JOBINON DOES THAT WITH ELACRITY HERE 'S JKE TAPPER'S ANSWER THAT JK TAPPERASKING THE QUESTION AND A CHRIST CHRISTY YHOU ACTUALLY YOU KNOW  KIND OF GAVE  NOT A HORRIBLE ANSWER ACTUALLY HERE YOU DO DESCRIBE THE PONDUCT I'VE DONAL TROM TRYING TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION AS I AS AS REPREHENSIBLE YU U DO CONDANA THE UT SO MANY PEOPLE IN YOUR PRARTY AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE RUNING FOR PROSEENT OR ON CAPITAL HILL BUT I MEAN VOTERS REPUBLICAN VOTERS DON'T SEEM TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT AN I'M WONDERING DO YOU THINK THAT YOU'R PARTY HAS AN AUTHORITARIAN PROBLEM THAT THEY REALLY HONESTLY DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH VIOLENTLY TRYING TO STOP IA FREE IN FAIR ELECTION FROM GOING GOING FORWARD YOUR CAKE  ABSOLUTELY DONT IC THAT WE HAVE THAT PROBLEM EITHER GOT WE HAVE IS A THOUGHT OF TROUP PROBLEM AD THAT RIGHT NOW WHAT'S GONE ON IS THAT PEOPLE OF YOU THOTE TRUP SYNONYMOUSLY WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THAT IF YOU OPPOSE TRUMP THAT'S SOMEHOW FAVORING BINON AND MANY REPUBLICAN'S TOT WANTER THROUGH THAT FOR VERY OBVIOUS REASONS GAT SO WHEN Y THAT LAST PART GRESSET'S GARBEDS BUT THAY LAST PARE WHAT HE SAYS WHICH IS DONAL TRUMP IS SEEN A SYNONYMOUS WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND SO IF YOU TELL PEOPLE IS EITHEREBIDON OR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OF COURSE A LOT PEOPLE CAN EVOTE REPUBLICAN THAT PART IS TRUE BUT WHAT'S INSULTING TO THE INTELLIGENCE IS THIS GENERALIZED NARRATIVE THE THEMEDEOR CONSTANTLY DRAWING IN WHICH THEY SUGGEST THAT FASHISM OR AUTHORITARANISM OR TYRANNY IS AN ELEMENT OF THE RIGHT AND THA THE LEFT IS COMPLETELY FREE THAT HIS HANDS ARE COMPLETELY CLEAN AND SO OBVIOUSLY NOXTR IN FACT WE HVE A YOU TUVIDIO A LATEST EPISODE IN OUR FACTS SERIES TALKING ABOUT WHETHER FASHISM IS RIGHT WAYING ONE OF THE ROOTS OF FASHISM THE TRUTH IS THAT FASHISM AS AN IDEOLOGY IS CLOSER TO THE AMERICAN LEFT THAN IT IS TO THE AMERICAN RIGHT FASHISM IS AN IDEOLOGY WAS GENERALIZED I RESPONSE TO COMMUNISM BUT IT DREW FROM MARXISM INTRUE FROM HEGELLIAN POLITICS IT DREW FROM PROGRESSIVE ERA IDEAS WHICH IS WHY MANY OF THE EARLY SUPPORTERS OF MUSOLINY WERE MEMBERS OF THE LEFT INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO HAD WORKED IN WOULD RO WILSON ADMINISTRATION WHOUD GO ON TO WORK IN THE FT YARD MINISTRATION SO AN GAIT THIS ORTOMEDIA LIE WHICH IS THAT THE RIGHT IS UNIVERSALLY AUTHORITARIAN AN THE LEFT IS FOR FREEDOM I DON'T SEE

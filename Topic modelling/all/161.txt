SIMPLY GOING TO GO AWAY IN FACT THERE'S AN ARTICLE IN THE EUROKE POST OVER THE WEEK END AT'S PRETTY DICY WITH REGARD TO JACKSMITH JACKSMITH IS OF COURSE THE SPECIAL COUNCIL WHO'S APPOINTED TO GO AFTER DONAL TRUMP AND MULTIBLE CASES HE'S GOT THE FLORIDA CASE OVER DOWN FROM S MISS HANDLING ALLEGEDLY OF CLASS FI DOCUMENTS AND HES GOT THE JANUARY SIX CASE UP IN WASHINGTON D SEE WELL NOWL ACCORDING TO THE YUROPOST TO TURNS OUT THE WHITE HOUSE COUNCILS OFFICS MET WITH A TOP AID TWO SPECIAL COUNCIL JACKSMITH JUST WEES BE FORE HE BROUGHT CHARGES AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT TRUM FOR LEDGEDLY MISS HANDLING CLASSFI TDOCUMENTS RAISING SERIES CONCERNS ABOUT COORDINATED LEGAL EFFORTS AIMED AT PRESIDENT BIDENS LIKELY OPPONENT IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR J BRATT WHO JOIN THE SPECIAL COUNCILTEM A NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO SHORTLY AFTER WAS FORM TOOK A MEETING IN THE WHITE HOUSE ON MARCH THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TMARCH THIRTY FIRST T WENTY TWENTY THREE WITH CAROLINE SABA THE DEPUTY CHEEP OF STAFF OF THE WHITE HOUSE COUNCILS OFFICE ACCORDING TO WHITE HOUSE VISITOR LOGS THREWERE JOINED IN THE TENNAMEETING BY DANUEL RAY AND AFPIA AGENTS IN THE WASHINGTON FIELD OFFICE NINE WEEKS LATER TRUMP WAS INVITE INVESTSMITH'S OFFICE ON JUNE EIGHTH TWENTY TWENTY THREE BRAD WHOS SIXTY THREE ALSO MET WITH SABO A THE WITE HOUSE N NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHEN TRUMP WAS MIRED IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES BRAD HAD A THIRD MEETIG INTH WITE HOUSE OFTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIS WITH CATHERON RILY IN INVISER TO THE WHITE HOUSEIS CHIEF OF STAFF OFFICE IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT EXACTLY WAS DIS COSSED BOT CRITICS IN LEGAL EXPERTS ARE QUOSTCUNING WHYBRAT WAS TAKING MEETINGS AT ALL WITH THE WHITE HOUSE COUNCILS OFFICE WHILE PART OF AN ACTIVE INVESTIGATION INTO PRESSENT AN BIDONS LIKELY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR PUBLICAN OPPONENT I VAS THOG RUJULIANE IS FIGHTING MADBAGSAS THERES NO LEGITIMATE PURPOSE FOR A DEO JA GI TO BE MEETING WIT THE WHITE HOUSE EXCEPT OF ITS COORDINATED AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS JULIANI SAID THAT HE BELIEVES THAT OBVIOUSLY THIS TO SOME SORT OF COORDINATION GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY LAP OVESSER JONATHAN TFRALLY SAID THAT THE METING WAS PARTICULARLY TROUBLESOME AND RAISES OBVIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT VISITS TO THE WHITE HOUSE AFTER BRAB BEGAN HIS WORK WITH THE SPECIAL COUNCIL HE SAID THERE'S NO REASON WHY THE DEOGATIOULD NOT BE ABLETO CONFIRM WHETHER THIS MEETING WAS RELATED TO THE ONGOING INVESTIGATION OR CONCERNS SOME OFTHER MATTER NOW THEORETICALLY AT COULD CONCERN SOME OTHER MATTER BUT THE FACT IS THT WHEN YOU HAVE MEETINGS BETWEEN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PROSCUTING DONALD TRUMP AND MEMBERS OF THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT A SPECIAL COUNCILS OFFICE SHOULD BE DOING QUITE OBVIOUSLY MEANWHILE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LEDGER THE CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO JOE AND HUNTER BIDON CONTINUE CAVEMAC CARTHY OVERTHE WEEKUNSPEAKER THE HOUSE HE WAS ASKED ABOUT SHUTTING DOWN INVESTIGATIONS IN TO HUNTER OR JOBIDNY SET OF CORSOM NOT DOING THAT WALK A THE YOUR SENARIO IS THAT YOU EX FACT DON'T YOU THINK WE'LL SEE A SHORT TERM CONTINUING RESOLUTION WHILE YOU FINISH THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS BUT ONE OF OUR GOALS IS TO CHANGE WASHINGTON WORE TIRED OF THESE OMNIBUS BILLS WERE CONGRESS DOESN'T DO THEIR WORK LIKE THEIR PROPRIATION SO IN THE DEATH CEILING WE PUT A PROVISION IN THERE IF YOU DIDN'T DONG YOUR JOB THERE WAS ONE PER CENT CUT ACROSS THE BOARD OMADE A LOT OF MEMBERS MAD BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING THEIR WORK I DON'T BELIEVE WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO PASH ALL THE APPROPRIATION BILLS BY SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH SO I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO HAVE A SHORT TERM CY AR ONLY TO MAKE OUR ARGUMENT STRONGER BECAUSE MARIA IF WE SHUT DOWN ALL THE GOVERNMENT SHOTS AT DOWN INVESTIGATION OF EVERYTHING ELSE IT HURTS THE AMERICAN PUBLIC BUT IF WE'RE ABLE TO PASS OUR PPROPRIATION BILLS WE'RE IN A STRONGER POSITION TO REMOVE THOSE THOSE POLOCY POLICIES THAT ARE LOCKED IN TO LALL RIGHT NOLT NA SO THE INVESTIGATION INTO HUNTER IS GOING TO BE ON GOING FROM CONGRESS AS WELL IT SHOULD BE VICTOR SHOKIN WHOS THE CENTER OF A LOT OF THIS CONTROVERSE YOU REMEMBER VICTOR SHOKIN HE WAS THE FORMER TOPUCRANE PROSECUTOR WHO IS TARGETED BY JOBIDON AS WELL AS BY BERRIZMA NOW JOBIDON'S CLAIM IS THAT THE REASON HE GOT SCHOKE AND FIRED IN YU CRAINE IS BECAUSE THEREIS INTERNATIONAL CONSTERNATION OVER VICTOR SCHOK IN HAVING THE POWER THAT HE DID THAT HE WAS CORRUPT IN ATS THE REASON THE JOBIDON WAS DOING ALL OF THAT BRISMAN WAS AT THE SAME TIME LOBBYING FOR SHOKIN TO BE GONE BECAUSE HE WAS INVESTIGATING BRIZMA HIS CLAIM IS THE REASON THAT JOBIDON DID IT IS BECAUSE HE WAS INVESTIG TTING BERIZMA HUNTER BIDE WAS ON THE BORDEBERISMA AND SOBIDAN SUDDENLY TOOK A MACHICAL INTEREST IN HIS PRARTICULAR JOB OVER THE WEEKEN HE DIDN'T INTERVIEW WITH BRYNG KOMEED IN WHICH HE TALKED ABOUT WHY HE THINKS HE WAS FIRED VICTORSHOKIN WHY WERE YOU FIRED FROM YOUR PROSITION BY PRESEN PRESCHENKKO NO YOUN I HAVE SAID REPEATEDLY IN MY THEINTOFUSE THAT WCASHANKO BIRE ME SHAV THE INIANS O THE THAN WIS A TAN MALITEM WESAUSE I WASN'NVESTOGATIN TERISMA SO THE PRESENT PRESHEKO TELL YOU THAT THE HE WANTED CUTO STAY ON THE JOB BUT THERE WAS PRESSHURE FROM PRESENT VICE PRESEN BIDE WE  NOSECHUSION A AN A YOU OUGHT TO SUT ME CORRECTLY THIS IS HOW IT WAS A THERE WERE NO COMPLAINTS WAT SOI WEN O MOS WA O I WAS  FORMIN AT A MY CO BECAUS CRASON WAS REPEATEDLY PUT ON PRESENT FASHANKO A THAT IS  WHA ANE T IN NO HEN FIRING ME HE SAYS THE REASON I OVERSAW THE BERISEMAN CASE WAS BECAUSE I WAS PROSCUTOR GENERAL BREISMOSAN ORDINARY CASE THERE IS NOTHING PARTICULARLY DIFFENT ABOUT IT SO TH REASON O TANDLING IT IS BECAUSE HIT DESERVED O SPECIAL MENTION IT WAS ON A LIST OF CASES TO MARISPECIAL ATTENTION TBECAUSE HUNTER BIDEN WAS INVOLVED THE BERISEMAN OF COURSE HIS FATHER THE VICE PRESIDENT BIDN AT THE TIME OVERSAW OU KRANE AFFAIRS FOR THE WHITEHOUSE THIS IS WHY HE ALSO ADDED HE HAD NO DOUBT BERISE MOST ENGAGED IN IN LEGAL ACTIVITIES AND SAID ITWOULD HALF A DAY TO EXPLAIN THEMALL AMONG THE ALLEGATIONS HE SAID THE BERIZEMENHT LEGALLY PRODUE SOLD AND UTILIZED NATURAL GAS SUPPLIES THIS GOING TO FOX NEWS IS AYS I'VE NO DOUBT THE RELEGAL ACTIVITIES ENGAGED IN BY BRISMA AS A MATTER OF FACT THE CRIMINAL CASE HAD BEN STARTED BEFORE ME IT CONTINUED TO EXPLAIN ANS LOVCHEVSKY WITH THE TIME  HELD THE POST OF MINISTER AND WAS THE FOUNDER IN C OBERISMA START BRINGIN PEOPLE WHO COULD PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR HIM HUNTER BIN WAS AMONG THEM THE CORUPTION OT WORK EXPANDED AS RESULTS AGESTAGAINSTERIOR QUESTION THERE IS NO DOUBT I MY MIND BERIZMOST ENGAGED IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES NOW AS FOXNEWS POINT DOUT IT IS PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT HUNTER CAL D C TO WORK ON SHOKIN HOWSOVER SI COMMTTEE CHIRMAN CHAMES COMMERSACK WHAT WHEN BERIZEMA'S OWNER WAS FASING PRESSUR FROM THE UCRANIAN PROSECURE INVESTIGATING COMPANY FOR CORRUPTION DEVEN ARCHER WHO WAS HUNTER BY ANS FORE BUSINESS PARTNER TUSTIFIED THE BERISEME EXECUTIVES ASKED HUNTER THO CALL D C AFTER BERIZMON BOARD MEETING IN TUBY ANFOXNEWSDITIONAL REPORTED THAT ON NA VEMBER SECTONDS WHENTY FIFTEEN BERISEME EXECUTIVE VATAN POZARSKY E MALED HUNTER BID AN ARCHER AND FELLOW HUNTER ASSOCIATE ARK SCHWERIN ABOTTER OF VISE PROPOSAL CONTRACT AND INITIAL INVOIS FOR BERISMA HOLDING FROM LOBBYING FROM BLUESTAR STRATEGIES HUNTER A PORTEDLY CONNECTEDBRISEMET WITH BLUESTAR STRATEGIES TO HELP THE ENERGY FROM FIGHT CORRUPTION CHARGES LEVIED AGAINST LOVCHEVSKY THE COMPANY'S OWNER AN PASHARSKY EMPHASIZED IN THAT HEMEL THE ULTIMENT PURPOSE OF THE AGREEMENT WAS TO SHUT DOWN ANY  CASES OR PURSUITS AGAINST T AT NICKOLI IN EU KRAN THAT' BE S LOVCHEVSKY A I GET IN BESHOKIN ALSO WENT ON HE ANCUSELY BIDINS OF ACTUALLY TAKING BRIBES HE SAID I I CONTINUED TO OVERSEE THEBERISMA INVESTIGATION WE WOULD HAV FOUND THE FACT ABOUT THE ORUPT ACTIVITIES THERE ENGAGING IN THAT INCLUDED BOTH HUNTER BIDAN AND AV AN ARCHER AND OTHERS E SAID I DO'T WANT A DEAL AN ON PROVIN FACTS MY FIRM PERSONAL CONVICTION IS YES THIS WAS TH E CASE THEY WERE BEING BRIBE THE FACT THAT JOBIDON GAVE WAY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN YOU OS MONEY AN EXCHANGE FOR BAN HIS MISSILE MY FIRING ALONE ISN'T THAT A CASE OF GRUPTION I MEAN THE ANSWER IS YES MEN THE ONLY QUESTION THERE IS WHETHER JOBIDON IS ABLE TO HIDE HIS MOTIVATION WHICH MAYBEEN OVER BREEZMOP BY SAYING THAT EVERYBODY WANTED CHOKAN FIRED ANYWAY BUT TWO THINGS CAN BEU TRO ONCE EVERBODY WANT TO CHO CAN FIRED AND THE REAL REASON THAT JOBINE WAS INTERESTED IN  CHOKIN TO THE POIN WHERE HE WAS CALLING UP THE PRESIDENT OF OU CRANE AND ACTUALLY SENDING E MELLS FROM A SECR TO COUNT TWO BIDON IN TO HUNTER OVER OU CRANE THE REASON MAYBE HE TOOK LIKE A SPECIAL INTEREST MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT HIS SON WAS WORKING FOR BREEZMUK AT THE TIME ALL THIS I'S NOT THAT NOT BY A LONG SHOT OTHER DEMOCRATS KNOW IT IS WHY THERE'S LITTLE BUT O BLOOD IN THE WATER WITH REGARD TO THE CURN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OKA WERE GN GET TO MORE ON THIS RACE IN JUST ONE SECOND

WISH TO FOLLOW IT'S CHINA THAT TAKES HUNDREDS O BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND JUS SHOVELS IT INTO PARTICULARL INDUSTRIES IN THE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL SOMEHOW MAGICALLY FIX THEIRE AILING ECONOMY JOBINE MATS TO DO THE SAMETHING HERE E CALLS TO BY NOMICS THE COMMONIST CHINESE CALL IT COMMUNISM BUT ISN'T EITHER BUT IT REALLY IS IS CORPORATISM IT REALLY IS THE GOVERNMENT PICKING AND CHOOSING PRS GIRL OF BUSINESS SECTORS OR BUSINESS IS AS THEY THINK OURE THE MOST IMPORTANT BUSINESS SECTORS ARE BUSINESS IS AND TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM MOST EFFICIONS TO GIVE TO THESE PARTICULAR SECTORS IT EXISTS ON BOOT TH LEFT IN THE RIGHT BY THE WAY AND ALL IT REALLY IS IS FAVORITISM COMBINED WITH POLITICAL IDEOLOGY WHICH IS NOT THE WAY THAT FREE MARKET ECONOMICS IS SUPPOOSED TO WORK IT DOES NOT GENERATE THE MOST EFFICIENT LEVELS OF GROWTH IT DOES NOT GENERATE THE BEST OUTCOMES FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION THE FACT THAT THE WESTS WISHES TO COPY CHINA AS CHINA FALLS DIRECTLY INTO THE PIT IS A IS ABSOLUTELY INSANE BUT AGAIN THE ILLUSION OF CONTROL IS SUCH A IT IS SO JUST DESIRIS FOR SO MANY PEOPLE IN POSITIONS O POWER THE ILLUSION THAT THEY ALONE CAN CONTROL THEY ALONE CAN FIX TGIVE ME ENOUGH POWER NO'LL FIX THE AMERICAN ECONOMY NOW THE ANSWER WHENEVERYOU HERE PRESEDENT OF EITHER PARTY SAY HE HAS CREATED JOBS IT IS A LIE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS NOT CREATE JOBS NEITHER DO CONGRESS PEOPLE YOU CREATE THE JOBS IN YOUR BUSINESS I CREATE THE JOBS IN MY BUSINESS WE CREATE THE JOP I KNOW BE CAUSE WE SIGNED THE PACHECKS OVER HERE THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVRNMENT PRETENDS THAT IT CREATES JOBS THE FEDERAL GOVEMENT CAN TAKE AWAYJOBS BY DESTROYING THE BASE LINE PRECONDITIONS FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THAT IS ONE OF THE THNGS THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU PARTICIPATE IN THE ECONOMIC FAVORITISM IN THE CORPORITISM THAT BOTH PARTIES ENGAGEINT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND THAT ITS ENGAGED IN BHY SOME OF THE MOST ECONOMICALLY FACIOUS COUNTRIES ON THE PLANET BY THE WAY ALL THIS IS HAVING PRETTY DIREFFECTS NOT JUST ON THE WORLD HECONOMY BUT MORE SPECIFICALLY ON THE LOWER END OF THE WORLD E CONOMY YOU'RE STARRING TO SEE A BUNCH OF COUNTRYES ABSOLUTELY COLLAPSE IN TERMS OF EMERGING MARKETS EMERGING MARKETS ARE SPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO FEDFOL POLICY ACCORDING TO THE WELTER JOUNAL BECAUSE HIRE UST RATES MAKE RISKIER ASSETS LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTOR VORY ON CAN INVESTAN NIGERIAN BONDS IF THE MONEY IS JUST NOT IS EASY SO AND GET READY FOR FOR ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT THE THE MARKETS ARE ON SOLID FOOTING I HAVE ON I HAVE A BRIDGE IN BROOKLAN THAT IS FORSAL AT THE MOMENT I CAN MEANWHILE ON THE RE PUBLICAN AT SIDE OF THE ALTOOBIDEIM IS INCREDIBLY VULNERABLE EVEN DEMOCRATS AR NOTICING THIS WHICH IS PRESUMABLY WHY YOU HAVE BURNING SANDERS TRAVELLING TO ME HAMPSHIRE REPUBLICANS ARE STEAMING TWENTY DONNALS FROM NOMINATION THERE'S JUST NOW TO WAST ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR PRESSIDENTIAL NOMINATION THE UP DATE IN THE REAL CLOPOLTIC PULLING AVERAGE HAS DONALD TRUMP UP FORTY POINTS OVER THE REST OF THE FIELD THERE'S BEEN SOME SIGN THAT THE VAC ROMASUAMEY IS STARTINGS RECEEDE BACK TO THE FIELD THAT NICKEY HAYLEY IS STARTING SO PICK UP A LITTLE BIT OF GROUND THE SOLID NUMBER TWO CONTINUES TO BE RON TO SANTIS BY PETY MUCH ALL THE AVAILABLE PULLING DATER RIGHT NOW HE CONTINUES TO BE NUMBER TWO PENCE IS PICKING UP A LITTLE BIT O GROUND IN SOME OF THE LATEST PULLS BY A LITTLE I MEAN HE'S UP TO FIVE OR SIX PER CENT IN SOME OF THE LATEST PULS NOBODY IS WITHIN SHOUTING DISTANCS OF DONALD TRUMP AFTER DONALD TRUMPS PICK WAS TOOK AT THE AT THE GEORGIA COURT HOUSE AT THE FULEN COUNTY COURTHOUSE THIT WASN'T THE CORTHOUSE THE JAIL AT THE FULLIN CANN JAIL HE RAISED MORE MONEY ON THAT DAY ALONE THAN HE HAD THE ENTIREDY OF THE CAMPAGN WHICH IS BOTH I WOULD SAY ENCOURAGING IN THE SENS THET RE PUBLICANS ARE VERY VERY MOTIVATED AND A LITTLE BIT DISCOURAGING IN THE FACT THAT IF YOU WANT ONAL TRUMP TO BE PRESIDENT TROBELY SHOULDN'T WAN BE PRESIDENT JUST BECAUSE HE TOOK A MUG SHOT NAS I SAID THE MUNGCHOUT AS AN AMAZING AMAZING MARKETTING OPPORTUNITY FOR DONALD TRUMP I TALKED OUT ON FRIDAY IT'S A GREAT MUGSHOT IF THERE IS SUCH A THING IT IS A GREAT MEN THERE ARE EMIN FRANKSON OTRUS MOST AMOUSLY MA GARG GREATE AND ICONIC MUGSHOTS THIS AN ICONIC MUGSHOT WELL TRUMP TRURN THAT GEORGIA MUGSHOT INTO GOLD ACCORDING TO POLITICO TRUMP RAISED SEVEN POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS SINCE HE IS BOOK AT AN AT LANTAGAIL ON THURSDAY EVENING ACCORDNG TO FIGURES PROVIDED FIRST TO POLITICAL BY HIS CAMPAIGN ON FRIDAY ALONE TRUMP RAISE FOUR POINT ONE EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS THE SINGLE HIGHEST TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD OF HIS CAMPAIGN TO DAHTE ACCORDING TO A PERSON FAMILIAR WITH THE TOTALS THE CAMPAIGNS FUN RAISING HAS BEN POWERD BY MURCH IT'S BEEN SELLING THROUGH THE OTLINE STORE WHICH AGAIN MAX ENS IS ALL PEOPLE SIGNALLING TO EACH OTHER THAT THEY ALSO WISHED TO THROW THE ESTABLISHMENTS THE GIANT ORANGE MINTAL FINGER THE CAMPAIGN IS ALSO BEEN PROTTING ON LINE DONERS WITH EMAILS AND TEXT MESSAGES AS WELL TRUMPS CAMPAGN SAYS IT IS RAISED NEARLY TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN LAST THREE WEEKS BASED ON THE REPEATED CHARGES AGAINST HIM NOW AS I SAID LAST WEEK THE POLLING DOES NOT DEMONSTRATE THAT TAT DONALD TRUMP IS LI CALLY TO WIN ELECTION BASED ON THIS IT DEMONSTRATES THAT HE IS LIKELY TO WIN THE NOMINATION BASED ON THE BASED ON THE CHARGED AGAINST HIM BUT THE FACT IS THAT IN MOST AMERICANS UNFORTUNATELY STILL BELIEVE THAT TRUMP SHOULD STAND TRIAL BEFORE THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ELECTION HE HAS A COURT DEIGHT IN GEORGIA TO DAY HAS NOTHER ONE IN DECEIT TO DAY ALL THIS CAN BE ABOUT SETTING THE TIME LINE THE CORT ATN TE CE IS ALL ABOUT SETTING THE JACKSMITH GANUAR SIXTH CASE IS THAT CAN BE BEFORE THE ELECTIONER AFTER HIS STEAM IS TRYING TO ARGUE HE SHOULN'T BE TRIED THERE UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY SIX ACTUALLY WHICH I THINK IS UNLIKELY MEANWHILE IN GEORGIA IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT TRUMP BUT THERE IS A LEGAL CASE AGAINST MARK METDOWS THAT IS ON GOING THEIR MARK METDOS IS TRYING TO HAVE THAT QART MOVE HIS CASE TO FEDERAL CORT AND HE'S THEN GOING TO CLAIM THAT BASIDLY THE SUPREMACY CLAWS PREVENTS HIM FROM BEING TRIED IN STAKE QUART THAT WHATEVER CRIMES HE SUPPOSEDLY COMMITTED HE COMMITTED AS A FEDERAL OFFICIAL IS CHEF OF STAFFTODONAL TRUMP AND THEREFORE HE SHOULD BE TRIED IN FEDERAL QUORT NINE STAKE QART IF TRUMP TRIED THE SAME THING THAUTALLYS FORE CLOSED THE POSSIBILITY THAT HE'D BE TRIED AND CONVICTED IN A STAKE QART AND THEN HE'D BE ON THE BALLET AND THEN YOU HAVE A REAL MESS OF CONSTITUTIONAL MESS BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT CAMT PARDON HIMSELF OF A NON FEDERAL OFFENSE BUT AGAIN THE POLLING DOES NOT SHOW THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC OVER ALL IS IN CREDIBLY WARM TOWRD DONALD TRUMPS LEGAL TROUBLES THERE' SOME PEOPLE WHOARE MORE WARM THAN THEY OTHERWISE WOULD AVE BEEN BUT THEY WERE CENNE LOUKEWARM TO BEGIN WITH AT I'M MORE ANIMATED ON BEHALF OF TRUMP BECAUSE THE TRIALS THAN I OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEE BUT I VOTED FOR TRUMPET TWENTY TWENTY SO I CANT VOT FROM TWICE YOU'LL GO THE POLLING DATA FROM POLITICAL AND WHAT IT SHOWS IS THAT SIXTY ONE PER CENT OF AMERICANS BELIEVE THER TRUMPS ELECTION TRIALS SHOULD TAKE PLACE BE FOUR THE ELECTION SIXTY ONE PER CENT MEANWHILE FIFTY ONE PER CENT BELIEVE THAT TRUMP IS GUILTY OF LEDGED TRIMES IN THE FEDERAL TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION SUBVERSION ELECTION CASE AT PENS TWENTY SIX PER CENT WHO SAY NO ALS ARE NOT GREAT NUMBERS MEANWHILE A PLURALITY OF RESPONDENCE TO POLITICOS AT A CONVICTION IN THE CASE FORTY FOUR PER CENT WOUL HAVE NO IMPACT ON THE LIKELY HTO OF SUPPORTING TRUMP WHICH MAKES SENS AGAN YOU FIGURE HALF THOSE PEOPLE ARE PRO HALF THOS PEOPLE ARE AGAINS BUT AMONG PEOPLE WHO SAID THAT THE RESULT WOULD IN FORM THEIR VOTE NEARLY ONE THIRD OF RESPOND INS THIRTY TWO PER CENT SAID A CONVICTION WOULD MAKE THEM LESS LIKELY TO SPORE TRUMP THAT INCLUDES ONE THIRD OF INDEPENDENCE ONLY THIRTEEN PER CENT OF RESPON IS TOTAL SAID A CONVICTION WOULD MAKE THEM MORE LIKELY TO SUPPORT TRUMP THAT FIGURE WAS MORE LIKELY RE PUBLICANS THAN NOT AND BY THE WAY THE NUMBERS COULD GO DOWN BECAUSE AS THE CASE DRAGS ON IN AS SORT OF THE SHOCK OF TRUMP BEING INTICTED DRAGS ON IT BECOMES LESS SHOCKING AND MORE NORMAL AND THEN THAT SHU BECOMES BAKED INTO THE CAKE BY THE WAY IF YOU LOOK AT AT WHO IS CONSIDERED A A VILLAIN IN THIS PERTICULAR CASE HERE IS IT HERE'S THE POLLING DATA AGAIN POLITICAL MAGZINEUS OS POLL DEOVE A FAVORABLE OR UN FAVORABLE OPINION OF THE ACTION STATEMENT TO BEHAVOR THE FOLLOWING PEOPLE REGARDING THE CASES AGAINST TRUMP FIFTY EIGHT PERCENTS ON FAVORABLE TWENTY SEVENE PER CENT FAVORABLE JOBIDON FORTY FIVE PER CENT ON FAVORABLE THIRTY SIX PER CENT FAVORABLE THAT IS A NINE POINT GAP NEGATIVE FOR BIDON THAT IS A TWENTY NINE PER CENT GAP FOUR DONAL TRUMP RIGHT THERE JACK SMITH TO THIS POINT STILL HAS MORE FAVORABLES THAN UN FAVORABLES AND SOT IS THE GEOGE SO IF THE HO PER IS THAT DONALD TRUMPS LEGAL CASES ARE GOING TO SPUR HIM TO THE PRESIDENCY AGAIN I THIN THERE'S MY POSSIBILITY THEY SPU HM TO THE NOMINATION BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S A MUCH LOWER CHANCE THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THESE SORT OF COUNTS REVAILING AFFECTIT THEN A LOT PEOPLE OFE ST ABOUT IN PEACHMEN I'VE NEVER BOUGHT THE ARGUMENT BY THE WAY THAT IM PEACHING SOMEBODY ATTUALLY HELPS THEM ELECT ORILLY I STILL HAVE GET TO SEE THE EVIDENCE OF THAT A BILCLINTON WASN'T PEACH NINETEENINETY EIGHT MAYBE IT HELP DEMOCRAT'S A LITTLE BIT IN SORT OF MINTRM ELECTIONS IT DIDN'T HELP ALL GORAN YO THOUSAN AND OBVIOUSLY IM PEACHING TRUMP TWICE DIDN' ROLLY MAY GAT DIFFERENCE ON BEHALF OF TRUMP IN THE

ATTEMPTING TO HAVE HIM REMOVED FROM STATE PRIMARY BALLATS ACCORDING TO YORK HE SAYS THAT EVEN THOUG CONVICTION TOS NOT LEGALLY BARED TRUMP FROM RUNNING AND WINNING THE HOPE IS THERE IS NO WAY CONVICTED TRUM COULD REGAIN THE PRESIDENCY FROM LEFT BUT THERE ARE SOME OF TRUMPS UPPONENTS WARE GOING FURTHER THEY'RE NOW EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITY THE TRUMP IS ALREADY DISQUALIFIED FROM RUNNING FOR OFFICE STATE ELECTION BOARDS OR SECRETARIES OF STATE THEY SAY CAN AN SHOULD SIMPLY RE MOVE HIS NAME FROM THE BALLOT IN THEIR STATES NO NEED FOR A HEARING A TRIAL LEGAL RULING LEGESLATION OR ANY OF THE OTHER STUFF NOW HOW WOULD THIS MAGRICAL SILLINUS WORK THE MAGICAL RESULT OCCURS PROPONENCSAY BY WAY OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMEN SECTION THREE OF THE AMENDMENT PRHIPITS ANYONE WHOAS TAKEN IN OATH TO AP PULL THE CONSTITUTION AND THEN ENGAGED IN INSURRECTION OR REBELLION AGAINST THE UNITED STATES OR GIVEN AID OR COMFORT TO THE ENEMIES THEREOF MAVER HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICE SECTION THREE WAS INTENDED TO

BASIS FOR MIGHT PENCE TO SIMPLY THROW OUT STATE SORTIFIED ELECTORAL VODES BASED ON LIKE NOTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION CANCHO MAKE THAT JUDGMENT THERE HASTIBULIC AN ACTUAL REASON THAT YOU ARE DOING IT BUT NOW TRUMPS OPPONENTS ARE TEMPTING TO  PRECISELY THAT AGAINST HIM ON THE STATE BALLATS IT'S ABSURD IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IF IT WERE TO HAPPEN WOULD BE A COMPLETE DISASTER AREA FOR BOUT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THE COUNTRY CAN'T JUST TAKE PEOPLE OFF THE BALLAD WITHOUT LIKE AN ACTUAL LEGAL REASON TO TAKE THEM OFF THE BALLAD TOTALLY CRAZIOCAN MEANWHILE RONDOSANTIS HAS PAUSED HIS CAMPAIGN

CRIMINAL HISTORY BUT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WAS NAMED IN D DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE CALL IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN HAD TO I BE PUT ON SEVEING TO OUR HOLD FOR MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION I I WILL POINT OUT AT THIS POINT THAT WHENEVER THERE IS E WHITE'S PREMISIS SHOOTING WE KNOW THE MOTIVES LIKE RIGHT AWAY AND WHENEVER THERE IS A PRETTY OBVIOUSLY MOTIVATED ANTI CHRISTIAN SHOOTING SAY IN NATIONAL TENNESSEE JUST TO TAKE A QUICK EXAMPLE WE STILL DON'T HAVE THE MANIFESTO OF THAT SHOOTER AND IT HAS BEEN HOW MANY MONTHS SINCE ALL THAT HAPPENE WHICH SEEMS A BAZAAR TO ME AT THE AT THE VERY VERY LEAST NT THE SHOTING OBVIOUS IS CONDEMNED Y EVERY ONE RANGING FROM PRESIDENT BYDON SAID WE MUST REFUSE TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY OR BLACK FAMILYE'S GOING TO THE STORE BLASSTON'S GOING TO SCHOOL IF INFERE BEING GUN DOWN BECAUSE THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN WHICH OF CORSE IS TRUE GOVENOR TO SANSIS SAID SOMETHING SIMILAR HE ALED THE SHOOTING HERRIFIC AND SAID THE THE STATE WAS OFFERING  SUPPORT TO THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES BUT AS I SAY

THER LOT OF LACK AMERICANS BY THE WAY WHO ARE VERY VERY PROGUN AND SOMETHING THAT THE LEFT WISHES TO A TO OBSCURE MEANWHILE THE REST OF THE RE PUBLICAN FIELD IS EM IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AWAY TO PRIWAY SOME OF THE SANS IS SUPPORT AND ALL F THEM ARE WI THE HELD BEHIND TRUMP OBVIOUSLY NICKY HALEY WHO PICKED UP SOME GROUND AFTER HER LAST GOOD DEBATE PERFORMANCE AND BY THE PULLING SHE DID HAVE PROBABLY THE BEST NIGHT OF OF ANY ONE IN TRMS OF THEAMOUNT OF MOVEMENT THAT HER CANDIDASE THE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE SHOOSE ASKE ABOUT PRESEDENT TRUMP IN HIM LEADING THE PULSION WHY WHAT I DROP OUT FOR TRUM CARRYLAKE SHE'S CALLING ON ALL OF THE CANDIDATES TO PAUSE THE CAMPAIGN TO GET BEHIND T OLL TRUMP BECAUSE OF TWO APPLICATIONS OF THE LAW I SI IS I SUPPOSE YOU'RE NOT CONSIDERING THAT I MEAN I PRECIATE AND  BODY TNEW ON WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN BUT WE'VE GOT A A CONTRY O FAVE AND I'M NOK AT A THOP AN TILL WEE FAVOR I THINK THAT WE LOOK AT THE FACT THAT WERE THIRTY TWO TROYAN DOLLARS AND DAT YO'VE GOT CRIME THAT THOP YE'VE GOT A LACK OF CRANT PARET AN THE CLAT RING WE'VE GOT AN OPEN BORDER AND THAT WE HAVE THRET FATHING OF THEROUND THE WORLD AN I THINK THAT WE NEED A NO CANERATIONAL WATER WE ASTEN FERIE PROBLEM T WET AIN'T AN PHILUNCION AY SO SHE'S NOT GONE ANYWHERE NOW PROBEM IS THAT OF COURSE THE FIELD CAN FRAGMENT SIX WAYS SHE'VE GOT GOT NICKYHAILEY WHO PRESUMEBLY IF SHE CONTINUES TO SHOW SOME SORT OF CREDIBILITY IN THE RACE I SUMES HIMS GOT AT SOME POIN IS GOINGTO DROP OUT BECAUSE YOU REALLY HAS NO SUPPORT OTHER THAN FRUM SOME MONEY PEOPLE IF HE DROPS OUT SOME THAT'S WHAT I SOON WILL MOVE OVER TO HAYLEY WHICH MAKES OR MORE COMPETITIVE AN SOUTH CAROLINA WHICH IRONICALLY MAKES DONAL TRUMP A LOTMORE COMPETITIVE IND SOUTH CAROLINA BECAUSE IF THE SOUTH CAROLINE PRIMARY SPLITS TRUMP TO SIANTIST HALY TRUM PROBABLY WALKS AWAY WITH A NOMINATION FAIRLY EASILY EVEN IF THIS RACE GETS A LOT TIGHTER MEANWHILE CHRIS CRISTY CONTINUES TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THE NEVER TRUMPLANE THINKING THE SIGONA WIN HIM NEW HAMPSHIR HERE WAS OVE THE WEEKEN AND THE TRUEH IS THET YOU KNOW WE CAN'T HAVE A CONVIC TID FELLIN H AS OR NOMANY FRPRESENT AND EXPECT FOR GOING TO WIN AND IT WAS REALLY MUST TO MATSIN PARTIN THE BATE TO ME WAS THE I THE O THEN YOU KNOW THE MASRITY OF MY CONPEDITERS BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN HAVE A CONVIC TIV FELLIN A AS AUR NOMANY FOR PRESIDEN AND TA THAT THE SEPORT THATIN THAT YEU COULD WIN I THAT'S AN IMPOSSIBILITY AY SO I MEAN THAT IS NOT WHT THEY WERE SAYING ON THE STAGE THERER THING IF HE'S HE NOMINEANS BY NAL VOTE FOR HIM THAT'S NO'T QUITE THE SAME THING AS A WE THINK THAT HE IS LIKELY TO WIN IF ALL THOSE PEOPLE ON STATE LOUHT HE WAS LIKELY TO WIN THEY WOULD BE RUNNING I ASSUME MEANWHILE THE PERSON SORT OF RUNNING STILL AS DONAL FROM SHADOW IS TO VACROM SWAMMY I'F A VAKE IN THE PULLING DATA HAS TAKEN SOME HITS SINCE THE DEBATE BUT OF COURSE HE WANT S BE ALIGHTNING ROD HE IS LIGHTNING RODIN HEIS REAL CAMPAGN ISN' FOR THE PRESIDENCY I'M NOT SURE THAT HE CARS I THINK THE IDEA THAT HE'S GETTING ALL SORTSOF VOUTSIZED ATTENTION MEANS THAT HE'S PRETTY WELL SET UP FOR A SAN AN OHIO CENTER RUN OHIOIS IS PLACE OF RESIDENCE OR FOR BEING A DONAL TRUM CABINET PIC OR FOR IF HE BE WELL HE IS NOW IN AN ATTEMPT TO A BEND OVER BACKWARDS FOR TRUMP SHIFTED HIS OPINION COMPLETELY ONTO TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR AFTER JANUARY SIEX SO IF YOU LOOK AT HE'S WANT ONE OF HIS BOOKS ONE OFHIS ATEST BOOKS HE TALK PECIFICALLY ABOUT JANUARY SIX AN HE SIZE THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOSE AN ELECTION YOU SHOULD JUST ADMIT YOU LOST AN ELECTION I HE IS NOW CHANGED HIS OPINION RADICALLY HERE IS U HE WAS NOT ASKED DURING THEDE BATE LOT RATHER CANDITS FOR ASTURING THE DEBATE ABOUT MIK PENCE HIS BEHAVIOR ON JANUAR SIX DID HE DO THE RIGHTHING IN SORT OFYING THE ELECTION THE ANSWER BY THEWIGHT IS YES UNEQUIVOCALLY YES THERE'S NO LEGAL BASIS FOR MIKE PENCE TO OVERTURN STATE SORT OF FIED ELECTION RESULTS I'M SORRY IF THAT HURTS FEELINGS THAT'S JUST THE WAY THAT IT IS BUT A VAKE HAS TRIED TOT HE'S TRYING TO SQUARE THE CIRCLE HERE AND COME UP WITH A WAY OF PLEASING DONALD TRUMP AND RIBPBING MY PENCE EVEN TOUG HE KNOWS PERFECTLY WELL THE MI PENCE DID THE RIGHT THING ON JANUARY SIX HERE HE WAS SAYING A THING THAT MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL AND AGAIN VIVIK IS TO SMART FOR THUS THE CANDIDATES ON STAGE ONE DAY NI' SAID MYTURE HENCE TIDS THE RIGHT THING ON JANUARY SIX DO YOU AGREE I WOULD HAVE DONE IT VERY DIFFERENTLY I THINK THAT THERE WAS A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY THAT HE MISSED TO REUNITE THIS COUNTRY IN THAT WINDOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE SAYS THIS IS A MOMENT FOR A TRU NATIONAL CONCENCEA SWERE THERE'S TWO ELEMENTS OF WHAT'S REQUIRED FOR FUNCTIONING DEMOCRA SAY N AMERICA ON IS SECURE ELECTIONS AND THE SET COND IS A PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER WHEN THOSE THINGS COME INTO CONFLICT THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HEROISM HERE'S WHAT I WOULD HAVE SAID WHE NEED SINGLE DAY VOTING ON ELECTION DAY WHE NED PAPER BALLATS AND WE EED GOVERNMENT ISSUE IDEA MATCHING THE VOTER FILE AND IF WE ACHIEVE THAT THEN WE HAVE ACHIEVED AT VICTORY AND WE SHOULD NOT HAVE  ANY FURTHER COMPLAIN ABOY ELECTION INTEGRITY SO IT WOUC YOU'VE GOS LIKE TENTS AN WOULD AS TO TO K OFAFI THE ELECTION SA IN MY CAPACITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE I WOULD HAVE LED THROUGH THAT LEVEL OF REFORM THEN ON THAT CONDITION CERTIFIE THE ELECTION RESULTS SERVED IT UP TO THE PRESIDENT O PRESIDENT TRUP THAN TO SIGN THAT IN THE LAW AND ON JANUARY SEVENTH DECLARE TO THE RE ELECTION CAMPAIGN PURSUANCE TO A FREE AN FEIR ELECTION I THINK THAT WAS A MISET OPPORTUNITY BUT THAT'S THE KOND OF SPIRIT WORE GAN A NEED TO OU NITE THIS CONTRY RATHER I SWEEPING THOSE CONCERNS UNDER THE RUG SO JUST TO GET THIS STRAT HIS SOLUTION WAS THAT ON GENUROS EX AVE RNOWNCS PRUNT TRUMPSPEN TWO MONTHS LYWING THAT MY PENCE COULD UNILATERALLY OVERTURN THE ELECTION AND ON GANURY SIXT HE WOULD HAVE NOT CERTIFIED THE ELECTION ON THE CONDITION THAT THEY PASS A LAW DOING ALL THE THINGS THAT I LIKE I LIKE THOSE THINGS ALSO BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE ACTUALLY DOES HE DOESN'T IN TE SHATE LEGISLATION HE'S A DECIDING VOTE HE'S NOT A SENTOR A BUT A CORING OF AVAKE HE SHOULD YOU KNOW GO OUTSIDE HIS CONSTUTIONAL DUTY HE SHOULD STAR PROPOSING LEGISLATION MY PENSE NOT CERTIFY THE ELECTION IN DEFIANCE OF HIS ACTUAL JOB AS THE PRESIDENT PROTIME OF THE SENATE AND THEN HE SHOULD AT THAT POINT SERTIFY THE ELECTION THE NEXT DAY AND THIS WOULD HEAL AMERICA'S CONFLICTS YET DON AS FROM TEFENLY WOUL MAN HABY WIT THAT PROWLY NOW TRUMPITOF SAID UT CAN NOW THEY' FIXED THE NEXT ELECTION I'M REALLY REALLY HAPPY WITH TH RESULTS OF THIS ONE PROWLY EVERYTHIG WOUL HAV GONE AWAY WAT IS HEVEN TALKING ABOUT ANY LIKE THE VAKE IS HA VERY SMARK ILE CAN KNO THE VAKE E'S A SUPERHIAC YU DUDE HE KNOWS WA BETTER THAN THIS AND THIS PART OF MY FRESTRATON WITH HIS CANDIDACY IS WHEN GAIN THIS MUCH CREDIBILITY THIS QUICKLY WEN GEN THIS MUCH ATTENTIONS QUICKLY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT OU HAVE SORT OF A DUTY TO SAY HONEST THINGS ND AGAIN HIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN IS TRUTH HE WOULDN'T DONE THAT HE KNOWS HE WOULDN'T HAV DONE THAT COME ON HE KNOWS HE WOULDN'T DONE THAT BECAUSE HE LITERALLY DIDN'T DO THAT O KAY I I'VE SPOKEN WITH THE VAKE AFTER GANUARY SEX BETWEEN GENERATE THAT'S WHEN I ACTUALLY SPEND HE MOST TIME WITH THE VAK IS BETWEEN JANUARY SIX AND LIKE NOW AND THE VAK HE'S NEVER TALK THIS WAY AND WE LITERALLY TALK THE OPPOSITE IN HIS BOOK UCAM BUT THAT THIS IS  YE FOR FOR FOR PEOPLE TO SHIFT WITH THE PREVAILING WINDS BOTHERS ME AND I GAN I FEEL LIKE WE'RE TIME OUT BLOWN OPPORTUNITIES THE VAKE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY THIS SA DUED FROM THE OUTSIDE WHOS EXTRAORDINARILY WEALTHY REALLY REALLY BRIGHT AND HAS THE OPPORTUNITY SHIFT THE DEBATE AND A LOTT A REALLY FASCINATING AN INTERESTING DIRECTIONS AND INSTEAD HE SAYING THINGS THAT HE KNOWS ARE NOT ACTUALLY VIABLE OR TRUE I THINK BECAUE AGAIN I I DON'T THINK THAT WHAT HE SAYING IS COHERENT AND I THINKHE'S COHERENT GUY SO FOR EXANTLY HE HAS A PIECE IN THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE TO DAY ABOUT HIS FORN POLICY AND IN I HE SAYS I WILL LEAD OUR NATION FROM THE BLOODY FOLLIES OF NEO CONSERVATISM AND LIBERAL INTERNATIONALISM ABROAD SORT A STRATEGY THAT A FIRMATIVELY DEFENDS OUR HOME LAND WE'LL BE UNCLE SUCCOR NO MORE RATHER THAN SPENDING BILLIONS PROJECTING POWER IN TO GLOBAL VACCUMS WO OUR ALLIES WILL NOT SPEND TO MAINTAIN IT THEMSELVES WE'LL PUT AMERICA FIRST AGAIN AS GEORGE WASHINGTON URGED

HERE'S MY POSITINUCRIM ABSE CHINYCRANE IS THAT THE UNITED STATE SHOULD BE TAKIN THE LEADERSHIP POSITION IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE RUSSIANS WHO SHOULD BASILY BE SAYING TO THE RUSSIANS WE ARE WILLING TO ALLOW YOU TO MAINTAIN OCCUPANC OF CRIMEA AND PART OF THE DON BAS RETION IN RETURN WE ARE GOING TO GIVE SECURITY GUARANTINES BUT NOT NATO MEMBERSHIP TO THE EUCRANIANS AND THAT'S CAN BE THE END OF THE WAR VEVAKE WANTS TO GO ONE STEP FURTHER IN A WAY THAT I DON'T THINK IS EVEN PLAUSIBLE A HERE IS WHAT HE SAS IS I WILL GO TO MOSCOW AND TWENTY WENTY FIVE I WILL DELIVER PIECING YOUCRANE ONLY UNDER THE TERMS THAT SHOUL MATTERTUS TERMS THE PUT AMERICAN INTEREST FIRST THE BY DMINISTRATION IS FOOLISHLY TRY TO GET G TO DUN POOTON RIGHT CHINA'S DUM BRUSSIA IN REALITY WE SHOULD GET POOTEN TO TUMP G OKANE NOW A NO I'M S CN PUT THAT OUT NOPE RUSSIA IS A GIANT GAS STATION WITH NUKLY WEAPONS THAT IS ITS ENTIRE ECONOMY YOU THINK THEY ARE GOING TO DUMP CHINA THAT THAT IS NOT A THING THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IT IS A WEEK STATE WITH NO INTERNATIONAL TIZES SINING A PIECE AGREEMENT WITH RUSSIA IS NOT GOING TO RESTORE THOSE INTERNATIONAL TIES TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY THAT RUSSIA WOULD SUDDENLY MAGICALLY SI TO DUMP CHINAQUOT A GOOD DEAL REQUIRE US ALL PARTES O GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT TO THAT END I WILACCEPT TO RUSSIAN CONTROL OF THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES AND LEDGE TO BLOCK YOU CRANES CANDIDATY FERNATO IN EXCHANGE RUSSIA ECCETING ITS MILITARY LINES WITH CHINDY NO RUSSIAS GOIN TO DO NOT THAT TENNI CAN EXETOR MILITARY LINES WITH CHINA WHY THAT HELL WOULD THEY CHIN IS THE ONLY COMPETITIVE POWER ON THE WORLD STAGE TO THE UNITED STATES AN THEN MEANWHILE HE SAYS FOR EXAMPLE THAT HE IS GOING TO HE'S GOING TO RECLEAR ECONOMIC AN APPENS FROM CHINA WHICH IS FINE AND THEN HE SAYS THAT HE IS GOING TO BE CLEARER WITH REGARD TO TIWAN SO HIS TAKE ON TIWAN IS HE SYS THAT WE AVE OPERATED IN STRATEACHICAMBIGUITY WITH THE GRARDTI WAN FOR FAR TOO LONG I'LL MOVE TO TR TO STRATECHI CLARITY BY WHICH IME IN THE CHINAMUSTUNDERSTAND I WILL DEFEND AMERICAN INTEREST IN TI WAN IF TIM WONE WANTS ANY PARTNERSHIP IN THEIR DEFENS THEY'LL MEN TO RAISE THEIR DEFENE SPENDING AND MILITARY READINESS TO ACCEPTABLE LEVELS MEANWHILE I'LL COMMIT TO MAKING SHRSTI WANE HAS THE WEAPONS THEY NEED FOR THAT DEFENCE BUTL FROM A SEABORN INVASION AND IN THE FUTURE FOR LONG FRM INSURGENCY AGAINST ANY OCCUPING FORN FORCE IF NEEDED AGET THAT NOW THERE'S ONLY ONE E PROBLET THAT THAT IS OUR CURENT POLICY THAT IS EXACTLY ARE CARN POLICY THAT IS STR TEACH A CAMPIGUITY BY THE WAY THAT WE WILL ARM THEM BUT WE'RE NOT DID I MISS THE PART IN THAT PARAGRAPHORY SAYS WHETHER WE WILL ACTUALLY LIKE ACTIVELY DEFENTI WAN IN CASE OF A CHINESE INVASION I DID NOT YE THIS KIND OF STUFF FROM OF ACHE IT'S THE REASON WHY HE HIS SORGE WHO'S BASE ON THE IDEA THAT HE WAS A FREE RADICAL HE COULD SAY WHATEVER HE WANTS IT AND THEN IT APPURES THAT HE'S NOW SAYING THINGS HE'S GOT A LABT AUDIENCE CAPTURE IT SEEMS LIKE HE'S SAYING THINGS HATHE WANTS PEOPLE TO THINK HE BELEASES BUT IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT U THAT HE ACTUALLY BELIEVES THOSE THINGSAND I THNK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME OFF ON THE STAGE THE OTHER NIGHT FOR VAGUE SO MY RECOMMENDATION TO HIM IN THIS CAMPAIGN IF HE ACTUALLY WANTS TAKE IT YNO AS A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IS STOP TRYING TO PLEASE PRESIDENT TROM PERSONALLY AND START ACTIVELY SAYING THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO HEARE BECASE I THINK HE HAS THE STRENGTH OF CHARACTER TO DO ALL THOSE THINGS HA MEANWHILE LET'S DO SOME LESS YOU SOME THINGS I LIKE IN SOME THINGS THAT I HATE SO THINGS THAT I LIKE OVER THE WEEKEN I READY A YO MY MY SORT OF BRAIN RELAXATION IS SPORTS I'M A BIG BASKET BALFAN RICH COEN WHO'S ONE O MY FAVORITE WRITERS WROTE A GREAT SPORTS BOOK CALLED WHEN THE GAME WAS WAR IT COMES OUT THIS

SO YESTERDAY THE REPUBLICANS VOTED INCREDIBLY NARROWLY TO INMPEACH SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY ALEHANDRO MERCUS VERY NARROW BECAUSE A FEW REPUBLICANS DEFECTED LIKE THROUGH REPUBLICANS DEFECTED AND REPUBLICANS AS WILL DISCUSSING JUST A LITTLE WHILE HAVE A SHRINKING HOUSE MAJORITY BUT THEY WERE ABLE ON A TWO FOURTEEN TO TWO THIRTEEN PARTY LINE VOTE IMPEACH THE HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY SO WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN IN FIRST ANSWER IS IN PRACTCAL TERMS MEANS NOTHING HEIS NOT GOING TO BE ACUALLY CONVICTED IN THE SENATE THERE IS NO SHOT THAT HE IS GOING TO BE CONVICTED IN THE SENATE IT WAS IN OPTICAL IMPEACHMENT IN THE SAME WAY THAT WAS NOPTICAL IMPEACHMENT BOTH TIMES DONAL TRUMP WAS IMPEACHED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT T WAS WORTHLESS IT WAS WORTH WHILE FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS ONE IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE CONTINUE TO HIGHLIHT JOE BIDONS ADMINISTRATIONS REFUSAL TO ENFORCE AMERICAS SOUTHERN BOARDER SIGTONA PURE POLICY MATTER THE ADMINISTRATION HAS KEPT THE SOUTHERN BOARDER WIDE OPEN THE'VE COMPLETELY RESTRUCTURED AMERICAN EMIGRATION LOSS WAS TO FACILITATE THE MASS MIGRATION OF PEOPLE UP THROUGH AMERICAS SOUTHERN BORDER YOUARE TALKING ABOUT ANYWHERE FROM SIX TO TEN MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE ENTERED THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY SINCE JOBIDON TOCAL OFFICE PEOPLE WHO ARE CLAIMING ASYLUM WAVING THEIR ARMS GETTING PICKED UP BY BORDER PATROL AND THEN BEING RELEASED ON PAROL INTO THE COUNTRY NEVER TO SHOW UP AGAIN THAT IS A DELIBERATE POLICY DECISION MADE BY THIS ADMINISTRATION EFFECTUATED BY THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY TO BE TOTALLY FAIRDALAJANDR MARCUS HE WORKS FOR JOBIDE SO HERE IS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE IMPEACHMENT CAS THI'S REALLY TWO QUESTIONS ONE IS IS THE BOR POLICY HERRIFIC AND SHOULD BE HIGHLATED YESATERRIFIC YESIT SHOULD BE HIGHLATED THEN THERE'S THE SECOND QUESTION WHETHER THAT MERITS IMPEACHMENT SO ON THE MERITS OF IMPEACHMENT THIS DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU THINK IMPEACHMENT IS FOR SO FOR NEARLY ALL OF AMERICAN HISTORY PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT WHAT IMPEACHMENT WAS ACTUALLY FOR WAS YOU KNOW HIGH CRIMES AN MISDEMEANORS WHICH IS WHY IT WAS BARELY EVER USED IT WAS USED IN CASES OF BRIBERY A COUPLE OF TIMES IT WAS BEING THREATENED AGAINST RICHARD NIXON BEFORE HE RESINE BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THE IMPEACHMENT CAT WAS NEVER TAKEN OUT OF THE BAG UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY HAD HIGH CRIMES AND MIS DEMEANORS TO ALLEGE AND THEN DEMOCRATS TWO TIMES ALLEGED NO CRIME BIDONAL TRUMP AND THN IMPEACHED HIM TWICE AND I SAID IN BOTH OF THOSE CASES THAT IMPEACHMEN WAS NOT MERITED BECAUSE EVEN IF I WILDLY DISAGREED WITH DONALTRUM'S ACTIONS BETWEEN THE ELECTION I NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY AND JANUARY SIX WOT TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE WAS NO ACTUAL CRIME THAT TOOK PLACE BAD BEHAVIOR IS NOT IMPEACHABLE CRIME IS IMPEACHABLE AN WHEN IT CAME TO HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH VLADAMER'S ALENSKY THE SUGGESTION WAS THAT HE HAD A CONVERSATION VLODMERS LENSKY BACKAN TO THOUSING IN NINETEEN IN WHICH HE ESSENTIALY THREATENED THE SUSPENTION AMERICAN AIGE OU CRANE IN THE LEAD UP TO THE WAR IN UCRANE SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE HOU WANTED THE AUCRANIAN GOVERNMENT TO GO AND INVESTIGATE HUNTER BIDON AND BEREZMA AND THE SUGGESTION WAS THAT THIS WAS HIM A SET ESSENTIALLY MILITORIZING AMERICAN MILITARY AID IN ORDER TO PURSUE A POLITICAL GOAL ON HIS OWN BEHALF AND THAT WAS THE IMPEACHABLE OFFENCE BUT THERE IS NO ACTUAL CRIME THAT WAS ALLEGED IN THE IMPEACHMENT DOCUMENTS IT WAS ALL AGAIN BAD BEHAVIOR INSO I SAID BOTH TIMES EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE DONAL FRUMS BEHAVIOR THIS NOT IMPEACHABLE  DEMOCRATS IS AGREED THE IMPEACHON TWICE SO WHY IMPEACH ALEHJANDRO MAORCUS WITHOUT ACTUAL HIGH CRIMES OR MISDEMEANORS THE REASON IS BECAUSE IF THESE ARE THE NEW RULES THEY APPLIED TO EVERY ONE EVENLY AND WE SHOULD ALL RECOGNIZE THAT IF WE WANT TO GO BACK TO STATUS QUO ANTI IF EONE PUT THE CAP BACK IN THE BAG THEN WE CANNOT HAVE A SITUATION WHICH DEMOCRATS GET TO IMPEACH REPUBLICAN OFFICIALS FOR NOT HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS AND THEN REPUBLICANS WILL ONLY IMPEACH FOR HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS SO THE IMPEACHMENT SERVES SO PURPOSES ONE IS AN OBVIOUSLY POLITICAL AND I THINK WELL MERITED PURPOSE WHICH IS GO AFTER THIS ADMINISTRATION ON THEIR CRAT BORDER POLICY AND TWO IS TO REESTABLISH A MUTUALLY ASSURE DESTRUCTION WITH REGARD TO IMPEACHMENT S THAT IF BOTH PARTIES WISH TO RESTORE WHAT IMPEACHMENT WAS FOR BEFORE WHICH IS JUST HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS LET'S GO BACK TO THAT OTHERWISE IS JUST GONTO BE EVERY ONE CAN BASICALLY ASSUME THAT IF IN OPPOSING PARTY TAKES CONTROL OF CONGRESS A PARTY THAT'S NOT THE SAME PARTY RUNNING THE PRECIDENCY THAT SOMEBODY IN THE WHITE HOUSE IS GOIG TO GET IMPEACHED THAT JUST THE WAY THIS IS GOING TO WORK ACCORDIG TO THE WALLSTRY JOURNAL WITH THE TWO HUNDRED FORTEEN A TOUNDER THIRTEEN VOTE MORCHUS BECAME THE FIRST SITTING CABINET OFFICIAL AND HISTORY TO BE IMPEACHED THE JUOP HE HAS BEEN PURSUING THE IMPEACHMEN FOR MORE THAN A YEAR ALLEGING THAT MARCHUS HAS WILFULLY REFUSED TO EN FORCE THE NATIONS AND MIGRATION LAWS POINTING TO THE RECORD NUMBER OF ILLEGAL CROSSINGS AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER MAORCHUS IS CALLED THOSE ALLEGATIONS FALSE AND OF COURSE IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES NOW AGAIN THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALEHAN DRA MARICHASON DOING A HORRIFYING JOB HE IS DOING A TRULY HORRIFING JOP BUT IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THERE ARE NO CRIMES THAT ARE ACTUALLY ALLEGED IN THE IMPEACHMENT DOCUMENTS AND LOOKING THE IMPEACHMENT DOCUMENTS RIGHT NOW AGAIN THE POLITICAL CASE FOR IMPEACHING MAYORCUS OR HALL IMPEACHING JOBIDON IS VERY STRONG IF BY THAT YOU JUST MEAN THIS PERSON IS DOING A REALLY BAD JOB AND BETRAYING THEIR PUBLIC OATH OF OFFICE AND SHOULD NOT BE IN THAT JOP SO FOR EXAMPLE THE IMPEACHMENT DOCUMENTS SAY THAT ALEHANDRO MAORCHUS HAS DEMONSTRATED HE'LL REMAIN OTHRAT TO NATIONAL AND BORDER SECURITY THE SAFETY OF THE U US PEOPLE AND THE CONSTITUTION IF A LOUGE REMAIN IN OFFICE AND AS ACTED IN MANNER GROSSLY IN COMPATIBLE WITH HIS DUTIES IN THE RULE OF LOVE AND I TOTALLY AGREE WITH ALL OF THAT AGAIN IS THAT A HIGH CRIMER MIS DEMEANER NOW ME I THINK JOBIDON DOES TOT PRETTY MUCH EVERY DAY AND THAT DOE THE MEAN HE HIS COMITTED A HIGH CRIME OR MISDEMEANOR BUT AGAIN THIS ABOUT TWO THINGS ONE IS REESTABLISHING A LEVEL OF DETERRENTS WITH REGARD TO WHAT USED TO BE A UCALLEAROPTION IN AMERICAN POLITICS IMPEACHMENTS A EVEN WHEN BILLCLINTON WAS IMPEACHE BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES BILLCLYN HAD COMMITTED A CRIME BILLCLINT COMMITTED OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE THAT WAS ALLEGED IN THE IMPEACHMENT CHARGEING DOCUMENTS THAT'S WHAT WAS THERE IT WAS DEMOCRATS WHO BROKE THIS GLASS AND NOW IT'S DEMOCRATIC AN TO HAVE TO PUT HIM BACK TOGETHER THAT'S ALL  GET' TO MORE ON THIS IN JUST ONE SECOND FIRST FOR ALL MY CHRISTIAN LISTENERS LENDS THE FORTY DAYS LEDING UP TO EASTER STARTS TO DAY IT'S TIME OF INTENSE PRAYER FASTING AND GIVING HALLO'S ANNUAL PRAY FORTY CHALLENGE IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR LAST YEAR OVER ONE MILLION PEOPLE JOINED THIS YEAR THEIR PRAY FORTY CHALLENGE FOCUSES UN SURRENDER AND INCLUDES MEDITATION S ON THE POWERFUL BOOK HE LEADETH ME THIS IS HE STORY ABAT A PRIEST YOU BECAME A PRISONER AN SLAVE IN THE SOVIA UNION DURING THE COLD WAR HIS STORY IS ONE OF ULTIMATE SURRENDER AND HOW WE ARE ALL CALLED TO OFF RUP OUR OWN WORRIES ANXIETIES PROBLEMS AND LIVES TO GOD THERE WILL ALSO BE LENT MUSIC LENSMIS OF TH BIBLE STORIES AND OTHER LENTS IN PRAYERS LIKE THE SEVEN LAST WORDS OF CHRIST WITH JIM COVESAL HOW IT IS TRULY TRANSFORMED OF THE  HULP YOU CONNECTS WITH YOUR FAITH ON A DEEPER LEVELS SO WHAT EXACTLY AR UWAITING FOR DOWNLO THAT HALLO AP TO DAY TAT HALLO DOT COM SLASH O PURO FOR AN EX CLUSIVE THREE MONTH FREE TRIAL OF MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND PRAYERS AND MEDITATIONS THAT HALLO DOT COM SLASH SHIPURO HERE'S NOTHING MORE PORDAN IN OR LIFE THAN RECONNECTING WITH THE DIVINE HALLO WILL HELP YOU DO IT BUT A HALLO DOT COM SLASH APPERILL GAT THAT EXCLUSIVE AT THREE MONTH FREE TRIAL OF MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND PRAYERS AND MEDITATIONS TO DAY TELL WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCEOS FROLTIS WHILE OBVIOUSLY IT KEEPS FRONT AND CENTERE ALL OF THE BORDER FAILURES OF THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THOSE BORDER FAILURES ARE MYRIAD AND SUPERPROBLEMATIC DEMOCRATS OUR CLAIMING OF COURSE THAT THIS IS ALL RIDICULAS AN THERE'S 'T THERE NOTHING TO IT AND INS THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE CLAIMING THAT IT WAS PERFECTLY FINE TO IMPEACH DONNAL TRUMP OVER NOT HIGH CRIMES AN MIS MEANERS NOW SAYING THAT ITS REALLY BAD TO IMPEACH MAYARCUS OVER NOT HIGH CRIMES ADMIS DEMEANERS OF FR EXAMPLE REPRESENT OF DAN BOLDMAN WHO ACTUALLY LED THE IMPEACHMENT AFFORT AGAINST TRUMP HE SAYS THAT GOING AFTER MAYORCUS US JUST ABOUT TAKING A SCALP WELL I MEAN THAT'S TRUE WHAT DO YOU THINK GOING AFTER TRUMP WAS AS WELLP THE PRESIDENT ATD SECRETARY MY ORCAS AND MONTHS NEGOTIATING KEE BY PARTISAN DEEL TO ATRESS THE SITUATION AT THE BORDER WHICH GOES FURTHER THAN ANY DEMOCRAT HAS EVER GONE BEFORE AND ALL OF A SUDTLE AFTER CLAIMING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION NEEDS TO ATTRESS THE BORDER THE REPUBLICANS AND DOVL TRUP DESIDE NOOT WE DON'T REALLY WANT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS WE WANT THE PROBLEMS SO THAT WE CAN PROD AGAINST THE PROLEMS AND THAT ISN'TCREDIBLY SENICAL A NOTS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT IT IS TAKING A SCALP SECRETARY BY ORCAS FOR THE MOCK A BACE AND TRYING TO LAY THE BLAME AT HIS FEET FOR SITUATION AT THE BORDER THAT MEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BUT CAN ONLY BE A TRESS BY LEGISLATION NOT BY EXECUTIVE ACTION AND OF COURSE THAT'S A LI RIGHT WHAT WHAT THE IMPEACHMENT IS ABOUT IS SAYING THE MERICHUS HAS EVERY LEGAL TOOL AT HIS DISPOSAL TO SHUT THE BORDER DEMOCRATS ARE OF COURSE CLAIMING THAT YOU NEED SOME SOR BY PARTIS IN PEACE OF ENABLING LEGISLATION IN ORNR CLOSE THE BORDER WHICH IS NOT TRUE ANDTHEN YOU HEAR BY THE WAY SOME REPUBLICANS BUYING IN TO THIS RETORIC BY SUGGESTING THAT THERE NEECS TO BE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT THEBORDER THERE ACTUALLY DOES NOT AGAIN I WAS DOWN AT THE PORT A TALK TO THE HEAD OF THE BORPATRAL UNION ION CAN WATCH THAT DOCUMENTARY THAT WE MADE ABOUT AT THE FIRST APOSOTE OF DIVIDED STATES OVIDING CAN CHECK THAT OUT OVER A DAILY WIRE WE DISCUSS ALL THIS IN DAPT THIS IS NOT A RESOURCE PROBLEM THIS ISE RESOURCE ALLICATION PROBLEM AND THAT IS IN FACT ABOUT ALJANDROMAORCHUS WHICH IS WI FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES IT IS NECESSARY TO REMIND EVERY ONE THAT THIS IS SOLELY ON THE BIDIAN ADMINISTRATION THAT THIS REALLY IS ABOUT THE BIDIN ADMINISTRATION AND LET'S BE REAL ABOUT THIS DEMOCRATS HAVE TAKEN THE OPEN BOARDER'S POSIT ON HAKEEN JEFFREYS WHO IS THE MINORITY LEADER OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTYG THOUSE HE SAYS THAT GREG ABBOT THE GOVERNOR OF TEXAS IS THE REAL PROBLEM BECAUSE GREG ABBOT IS YOU KNOW TAKING E LEGAL EMIGRANTS AND TELLING THEM THAT THEY N GET ON A BUST TO NEW YORK OR CHICAGO HE SUGGEST THAT HE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR HUMAN TRAFFICING FOR TELLING PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN GO TO MAJOR AMERICAN SANCTUARY CITIES BUT JOBIDEN IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HUMAN TRAFFICING FOR LITERALLY FACILITATING THE ENTRY OF MAYBE TEN MILLION PEOPLE INTOTHE COUNTRY DO YOU NOT SEE THAT THE MOVE BY GOVERNOR ABBOT OF TACIS A TO BOS MIGRANTS TO DEMOCRATICALLYANING CITY SUCH IS NEW YORK OR CHICAGO OR DENGER THAT WHILE YOU MIGHT THINK IT'S CRUEL IT HAS BEEN A FACTIVE AN DEMONSTRATING HOW THIS INFLICT INFLEXOF MIGRANS HAS SAMP SOCIAL SERVICE RESOURCES AND DEMONSTRATED THAT THIS IS A REAL CRISIS I DO YOU D YOU AGREE WITH THAT OGOVERNOR ABBOT ISAN ABARATMEN AN A HUMAN TRAFFICER THEY WANT TO KEEP THE BORDER OPEN WHEN YOU SUGGEST THAT ABBOT IS THE EMBARRASSMENT IN THE HUMAN TRAFFICER IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS WHAT YOU WANT AT ALL OF THIS OBVIOUSLY PLEAYS IN TO BROUDER CONCERNS ABOUT JOBIDON'S PRESIDENCY THE REASON THET DEMOCRATS ARE VERY UPSET ABOUT THE IMPEACHMENT OF MAYORKUS IS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY' SUGGESTS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT JOBIDON IS TRULY A BAD PRESIDENT BECAUS JOBIDON IS TRULY A BAD PRESIDENT AND ALL OF THE FACTORS THAT ARE MILITATING AGAINST HIS REELECTION ARE NOW COMING INTO PLAY ACCORDING T BRIGT BAT DA COM PRESIDEN JOBIDONAT MAINTAINED A PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY WHILE HIS FAMILY BUSINESS RAKED IN MILLIONS FROM SEVERAL FORN ANTITIES INCLUDING C E F S CHINA ENERGY COMPANY WHICH COMPROMISE THE PRESIDENT ACCORDING TO FORMER BIDON FAMILY BUSINESS PARTNER TONING BOBOLINSKY HE WAS TALKING TO THE HOUSE IM PEACHMENT INQUIRY THERE'S IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY INTO JOBIDON HIMSELF HIS TESTIMONY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT HE ACTUALLY DID MEET JOBIDON IN THE LOBBY F THE BEVERLY HILTON HOTEL AND MADE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO DISCUSS BUSINESS WITH C E F S AND HE'S ALSO THE WHISTLE BLOWER WHO MENTION BYBOLINSKI IS THAT THE INFAMOUS EMAIL ABOUT A STAKE OF TEN PER CENT HELD FOR BY AH FOR THE BIG GUID THE BIG GUI WAS JOBIDON THERE WIS A CARVOUT FOR JOBIDON ACCORDING TO BOMOLINSKY HE SAID THE ONLY REASON ANY OF THSE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS TOOK PLACE WITH TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SLUNG DIRECTLY TO THE BIDON FAMILY WAS BECAUSE JOBIDON WAS A NHIGH OFFICE THE BIDON FAMILY BUSNESS WAS JOBIDON PERIOD OTHER PLAYERS HAVE MADE THIS POINT VERY CLEAR AS WELL HUNDER BIDON HIMSELF IS ABDIMENTLY STATED IT IN A VARIETY OF COMMUNICATIONS AS DID ANOTHER BIDON FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATE DOVAN ARCHER IN HIS TESTIMONY LAST YEAR NTHE PERCEPTION OF JOBIDON AS SOME CLEAN POLITICIAN WHO IS NEVER BEEN INVOLVED IN CRUPTION IS OBVIOUSLY NOT TRUE SEE ABD TOGETHER HIS POLITICAL IN COMPATENTS HIS ACCUSATIONS OF CRUPTION THATARE STILL SWIRLING AROUND HIM THOSE SORT OF TAKEN A BACSIT TO THE BIGGEST ISSUE SURROUNDING HIM RIGHT NOW WHICH IS HIS OBVIOUS SINILITY WHEN HE IS OBVIOUSLY LOSING IT ONAMENTAL LEVEL EIGHTY SIX PERSENT OF AMERICANS BY THE LATES PLOYING TOY TO THINK HE IS TOO OLD TO BE PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND MEANWHILE DEMOCRATS HAVE NO

OF PRODUCTS THET ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE NOW THAN THEY WERE BEFORE OVER THE COURSE ELASTER YEARS HIVE S THE EVERYTHING IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN IT WAS BEFORE WHICH IS BY THE STOCK MARKET TOOK HA DUMP YESTERDAY DROP FIVE HUNDRED POINTS BECAUSE THE MARKET IS REALIZING THAT IT'S NOT TIME FOR LOOSE MONITARY POLICY AGAIN SEAN BE SEE STEVELEESMAN HE SAYS LESSEN WAS ALOWSIN MON FOR INPLATION

WORL YO AT FOOD PRICES O IT WAS A JUST A BOUSY MON WHAT A CAN YOUI PAICO PORS REALI IS ALSO TE CLINE I IN THE MO A WORT POINTING OUT A SO UM YES THINGS ARE BAD FOR JOBITE NOW DOES THAT MEAN THAT JOBIDON IS GOING TO WHEN  LOSE IN IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SO WE HAVE SOME EARLY INDICATORS AND THEY'RE NOT AMAZING FOR REPUBLICANS SO LAST NIGHT THERE WAS AN ELECTION IN THE HOUSE SEAT TO SUCCEED GEORGE SANTOS YOU'RE MEMBERED TOR SANTOS HE'S THE WEIRDO WHO IS FITTING ABOUT HIS NAME AND HIS SECTUALITY AND PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING ELSE GEORGE SAND REMEMBER THIS LAINED CONARTIST HUCKSTER MAYBY LIBLE FOR CRIMINAL TRARTS ANYWAY H GOT TOSSED OUT OF HIS SEAT BY THE CONGRESS AND THAT LEFT TO SEE BACANT THAT SEAT WAS A DEMOCRAT DISTRICT IT HAD BEEN RATED TO TOSS UP BY COOK POLITICAL REPORT SO IS A PRETTY HOTLY FOUGHT RACE BETWEEN A  DEMOCRATE NAME TOM SUASY TOM SUASY HAD HAD THAT SEAT FOR A COUPLE OF TERMS BEFORE SANTOS TOOK IT IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND HE WAS RUNNING AGAINST REPUBLICAN A MASSY PILLOP WHO'S REALLY S FOR OF FASCINATING CHARACTER ETHEOPIAN JEW WHO WAS PRO TRUMP BUT DIDN'T RUN HER CAMPAIGN ON THE BASIS OF TRUMP BECAUSE ISSHE HAD IT WOULD BEEN BAD THAT THAT IS NOT EXACTLY A A TRUMP RICH NEIGHBORHOOD JOBIDON WON THAT DISTRICT IN ANY CASE THAS HE PILLOP LOST LAST NIGHT SHE LOST BECAUSE AGAIN THERE'S A LOT O MONEY THOSE TOSSED IN TOM SUASI AS A VERY STRONG GROUND GAME IIS VERY SNOWY OUTSIDE AND AND ALL THE REST BUT SPECIAL ELECTIONS IN THIS ELECTIONS LIKLE HAVE NOT BEEN GOING WELL FOR EPUBLICANS OVER ALL THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THAT THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS BELL LEATHER DOESN'T MEAN THAT'S NESERLIAN GO AMAZING FOR DEMOCRATS AN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WITH THAT SAID THESE SPECIAL LECTIONS IF THEY'RE GOING FOR REPUBLICANS WOULD PROBABLY BE AN INDICATOR THAT TWENTY TWENTY FOUR COULD THEORATICALLY BE A REPUBLICAN WAVE YEAR IN THE FACE OF DEMOCRATIC FAILURES THE PROBLEM IS DEMOCRAT'S RIGHT NOW OUR ONLY LOSING THE HOUSE BY LIKE A COUPLE OF VOTES WITH THE LOSS OF THIS SEAT THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE MAJORITY IS DOWN TO THREE OR FOUR TOOTAL VOTES AN SOME OF THOSE SEATS OUR CURTLY BEING OCCUPIED BY PEOPLE LARN SHOWING UP FOR CONGRESS SO THAT MEANS THAT IN THE UPCOMING TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ELECTIONS THERE'S A VERY NOT INSIGNIFICANT LIKELIHOOD THE DEMOCRATS AND OF TAKING THE HOUSE AND FRALL THE TALK ABOUT REPUBLICANS TAKING THE SENATE THOSE THEN ARE RACES ARE VERY CLOSE SO ONE OF THINGS REPUBLICANS SHOULD KEEP IN MIND IS THAT THEYRE RUNNING AGAINST A DEAD PERSON EIGHTY SIX PER CENTIF THEAMERICAN PUBLIC THINKS THET JOBIDON IS DEAD THEY HATE HIM ON EVERY ISSUE AND REPUBLICANS ARE ANING DEAD EVEN IN PRETTY MUCH EVERY POLL DOWN RUMS ARING DEAD EVEN WITH JOBIDON ONE OF THE WAYS THAT YOU CAN MILITATE AGAINST THAT THE CAN FIGHT AGAINST THAT IS TO USE EVERY VOTING TOOL AT YOUR DISPOSAL ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS IN NEW YORK IS THET REPUBLICANS DID NOT VOTE EARLY THEY DID NOT USE MAIL AND BALLATS YOU KNOW WHO DID THE DEMOCRATS THE DEMOCRATS USE THE MAL AND BALLAST NOW WHOL COULT IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHO WOULD HAVE SUGGESTED THE MAIL AND BALTS ARE STUPIN USHON USE THEM WHO WOULDHAVE PROPOSED SUCH A FOOLISH PROPOSITION THEY YOU SHOULD YOU KNOW NEVER THAT IT'S ITS SOMEHOW MORALLY BAD DEVOTE EARLY IF YOUR REPUBLICAN THUS LOSING TWO CENTETEATS IN GEORGIA AND MAY BE HIS OWN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION DOWNS RUM BETER FLIP ON THAT LIKE RIGHT FASTS BECAUSE USE EVERY METHOD AT YOUR DISPOSAL TO WIN IT'S LEGAL WHY WOULD YOU NOT ENCOURAGE REPUBLICANS TO VOTE EARLY ACCORDING TO THE WOLSTRY JOURNAL SAZI WILL SUCCEED GEORGE OSANTOS HE CUTZINS WHEN ALREADY NARROWED CUPE MAJORITY IN THE CHAMBER THE PARTYBREAK TOWN IS CURRENTLY TWO NINETEEN TO TWO TWELVE SAZI BE BACK CRITICISM FROM PILL UP OVER THE BY DMINISTRATIONS STEWARDSHIP OF THE SOUTHERN BOR AS WELL AS THE HANDLING OF ERIC ADAMS OF THE MIGRAN CRISIS IN NEW YORK CITY SAZI SAID THE RACE WAS CENTER AN EMIGRATION AND THE ECONOMY MUCH LIKE THE ISSUES ALL ACROSS OUR COUNTRY WE OU ON THIS RACE BECAUSE WE

BUCKS COUNTY PENSYLVANIA TO DETERMINE CONTROL OF THE STATE HOUSE OF REPRESENTIDATES IRE'S A BIDING PLUS TEN DISTRICT S SOLIDLY BIDIN DISTRICT THE RACE WAS CALLED FOUR THE DEMOCRATS OVER THE REPUBLICANS WITH ONLY FORTY THREE PERCENT OFTHE VOTE COUNTED WHY WELL BECAUSE THE DEMOCRAT WON THE MAIL AN VOTE EIGHTY SIX TO FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX TO FOURTEEN WHY BECAUSE REPUBLICANS KEEPS SAING STUPID THINGS LIKE DON'T VOTE BY MAIL DUM DUM DUM DON'T DO THAT THE OTHER THING THA YOU SHOULDN'T DO IS PROBABLY YOU SHOULD NOT RUN EVERY CONGRESSIONAL OR SENTATE RACE ON THE BASIS OB DOES DONALD TRUMP LOVE THE CANDIDATE PERSONALLY SO THE CANDIDATE IN THAT RACE AGAIN MASSY PILLOP WAS ON ANTI TRUM CANDIDATE JUST GOS IN A PERSON WHO MADE TRUMP THE CENTRPIECE FOR CAMPAIGN AND DOM TRUMP IS A VERY BAD HABIT WHICH IS CRAP ON CANDIDATES SOME OF WHOM HE INDORSES BY THE WAY WHO THEN GO ON TO LOSE BY SUGGESTING THAT IF THEY TIED THEMSELVES MORE CLOSELY TO HIM THEY WOUL HAVE ONCE HE PUT OUT A STATEMENTS AND QUOTE I HAVEN'T ALMOST NINETY NINE PER CENT INDORSEMEN SUCCESSORATE IN PRIMARIES AND A VERY GOD NUMBER IN THE GENERAL ELECTIONS AS WELL BUT JUST WATCH THIS VERY FOOLISH WOMAN MASSY PILLOP RUNNING IN ARACES WHERE SHE DIDN'T INDORIS ME AND TRIED TO QUOT ON QUOT STRATLE THE FENCE WHEN SHE COULDHAVE EASILY WON IF SHE UNDERSTOOD ANYTHING ABOUT MODERN TAY POLITICS IN AMERICA MAGE WHICH IS MOST OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY STAYED HOME AND IT ALWAYS WILL UNLESS IT IS TREATED WITH THE RESPECT THAT IT DESERVES I STAYED OUT OF THE RACE I WANT TO BE LOVED GIVE US A REAL CANDIDATE IN THE DISTRICT FOR NOVEMBER SAZY I KNOW WELL CAN BE EASILY BEATEN A SO IM MEAN NO ME NO IT TURNS OUT THAT RUNNING RACES IN CONGRESS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT TRUMP IS NOT A RECIPE FOR ELECTORAL VICTORY IS JUS NOT THEY'REA LOT O PURPLE DISTRICTS OR PEOPLE DON'T PARTICULARLY LOVE TRUMP THERE'S SOME DISTRICTS RED DISTRICTS WHERE YOU CAN LOVE TRUMP AS MUCH AS YOU WANT THEN'L BE GOOD FOR YOU YU'RING THAT HEAVY RED DISTRICT THOSE DISTRICTS TENDA LOVE DONAL TRUMP THIS DISTRICT WHEN FOR JOBIDON IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION RUNNING ON THE BASIS OF I LOVE TRUMP IN A BIDON PLUS EIGHT OR BIDIN PLUS TEN DISTRICT WOULD NOT EXACTLY BE SMART POLITICTS IF REPUBLICANS CONTINUED TO FOLLOW THAT ROAD IN ELECTIONS THAT IS NOT GOING TO END PARTICULARLY WELL FOR THEM IT JUST ISN'T S AGAIN THE FACTORS AGAINST JOBIDON'S REELECT ARE VERY SOLID BUT CAN REPUBLICANS SNATCH DEFEAT FROM THE JAWS VICTORY YOU BHAT YOU'RE ASTS THEY CAND TEE REALLY GOOD AT IT THERE'S BEN THE LAST FEW YEARS DOING IT JOBIDE WAS A WEEK CANDIDATE IN TWENTY TWENTY TOO AND SOMEHOW HE WON SO AGAIN REPUBLICANS BETTER YET SMART ABOUT ALL OF US O CAN MEANWHILE THE CONGRESS CONTINUES TO DEBATE THIS MASSIVE FOREIGN POLICY AID BILL IT IS NOW MOVE TO THE HOUSE IN NINETY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR AIGD PACKAGE BUT SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS IN MILITARY AIDS U CRANE ANDTHIS WEN WE SHOLD BE CLEAR THAT THE SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS IN MILITARY AS U CRANE A LARGE PART OF THAT IS TO RE STOCK THE AMERICAN MILITARY BUILD UP THAT IS ALREADY GAUNTU CRANESTO WE SENT WEAPONS TO U CRANE THAT WAS MILITARY AID AND NOW WE HAVE TO RESTOCK ALL THAT FOR OWN PURPOSE IS AND THAT IS CONSIDERED MILITARY AID TO U CRANE AND T WE WE HAVE TO IT'S ESTULY NOT A BAD THING FOR AMERICAS MILITARY BASE TO BE BUILTS UP THAT'S ESTULY QUITE A GOOD THING NOW THE QUESTION AS I'VE SAID IS I'S ALL SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT NECESSARY IN ORDER O PREVENT RUSSIA FROM TAKING THE COUNTRY LAID ALL OF THE TOUT YESTERDAY THAT WHAT'S AMAZING ABOUT OURE FORM POLICYED BATESES NO ONE IS WILLING TO CLEARLY STATE WHAT THEIR EN GULL IS ON VIRTUALLY ANY OF THIS AND BECAUSE REPUBLICANS ARE NOT BEING CLEAR BUT WHAT THEIRE UNGLES ARE THAT LLOWS DEMOCRATS NOT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THEIR UNGLES SO IF REPUBLICANS TO SILIZEN WE WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO OU CRANE NECESSARY TO PROVENT RUSSIA FROM OVERRUNNING ITS CURRENT POSITIONS THT'S THE AMOUNT MONEY WE'RE WILLING TO SEND AND MEANWHILE WANTS TO AGGRESSIVELY HAVE THE PRESIDENT AND SA DEPARTMENT NE GOTIATE IN END TO THIS CONFLICT THAT LOOKS LIKE WHAT EVERYBODY KNOWS THE END OF THE CONFLICT IS CAN LOOK LIKEUHAGE IS A SOLIDIFICATION OF THE CRREN BORDER SITUATION PLUS AMERICAN SECURITY GARANTEES IN EUROPEAN SECURITY GUARANTEES TO U CRANE THAT'S EFFECTIVELY THE OUTLINE OF THEO IF REPUBLICANS SAID THAT WOD BE VERY HARD FOR JO BIDON TO COME BACK WITH SOMETHING DIFFEREN CAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT IS THE LOGICAL SOLUTION IT BUT INSTEAD REPUBLICANS SEEM TO BE IMPLYING SOME REPUBLICANS SEEM TO BE IMPLYING FOR EXAMPLE THAT IT WOULD BE TOTALLY FINE NOT JUST IF POOTEN WORD TO CONTINUE THE WAR BUT IF PUTTINGWERE TO OVERRUN KEYVE AND THAT ALLOWS JOBIDON TO THEN GO OUT THERE AND SUGGEST THAT THIS FOREIGN AID BILL IT'S ALL ABOUT PREVENTING KEEVE FROM BEING OVERRUN WHICH IT'S DONE CLEAR TO ME THAT THAT'S WHAT IT IS ABOUT THERE'S MUCH OTHER GARBAGE IN THE BILL IS WELL ANOTHER WARS THE'RE MANY GOOD PRINCIPALED GROUNDS TO OPPOSE THE FOREIN AID PACKAGE AN SAY THAT IT'S TOO LARGE YOU COULD EVEN SUGGEST I THING A LITTLE BIT LESS CREDUL  CREDIBLY THAT IT'S A MIS PRIORITIZATION BECAUSE WE NEED TO SPEND THAT MONEY ON TH BORDERS HAVE SAID BEFORE THE PROMIN TEBORD IS NOT A MONEY PROBLEM PLUS LET' S BE REAL ABOUT THIS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY GRANTED IN TO TO FOREIGNAIGHT EVENIN PLACES LIKE CRANE AMOUNTS TO APPROXIMATELY A FRACTION LIKE A SMALL TINY LITTLE FRACTION OF WHAT THE AMERICAN BUDGET TYPICALLY IS IF YOU'R TALKING ABOUT THE AMOUNT THAT HAS BEN PROVIDED TO YOU CRANE OVER THE COURSE OF THIS WAR WHICH WOULD BE MOUNTEN MAYBE A HUNDRED BILLING DOLICESTOOK ONE POINT FOUR PER CENTS OF THE AMERICAN ANUAL BUDGET OU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE KINDS OF MONEY THE BANKRUPT TE ECONOMY THE SEF THE BANKRUPTS THE ECONOMY BY THE WAYS ALL THE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS THAT NO ONE IS WILLING TO TOUCH AND THAT'S WHY AL WES FIND AT IRONIC THERE SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE REAL SPENDING HOWX IC RAN PULSE SPENDINGHAWK THERE CERTAIN PEOPLE FOR DEFINITELY NOT SPENDING HAWKS AND NOW THEY'RE BUCKING AT THE SPENDING I LAY AY FEEL LIKE THAT'S NOW WHAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT IN ANY CASE JOBIDON IS USING REPUBLICAN LACK OF CLARITY ON WHAT THEY WANTS IN ORDER TO PUSH THE IDEA THAT RE PUBLICANS WANT PUTENT TO WIN WHICH AGAIN I'VE TALK TO MANY OF THE SENATORS WEARE VOTING AGAINST THE FOREIGNADE BILL THEY DON'T WANT PUTTIN TO WIN THEY JUST THINK THE FOREINAD BILL IS TOO LARGE BUT THIS IS WHY BEHOVES YOU TO BE CLEATER ABOUT YOUR POSITIONS ON THESE PARTICULAR ISSUES WELL GET TO THAT IN JUST ONE SECOND FOLKS I HAVE GOOD NEWS IN IVE BADNEWS THE BADNEWS IS MOST OF THE PRODUCTS IN YOUR BATHRUM THEY'RE WOK YEUN LOOK AT THEM LOOK AT THE COMMERCIALS FOR THE PRODUXVE BOUGHT LATAMAR WOK THE GOOD NEWS IS GERMEYS ONCE HELP YOU WASH THE WOLK AWAY WITH FIFTEEN PER CENT OFF ALL OF YOUR ESSENTIALS ALONG WITH GERMY SKIN CAPRODUCTS THE FICIAL CLENS ER IN MOISTRIZER ARE MADE WITH NATURAL INGREDIENTS LIKE ALIVERA BAM BUCHARCOAL AND HILERONIC ACID AND GERMY'S WLEAVES OUT TOXIC CEMICALS LIKE PARABIN SULPHIES AND FLITEEVILL HOW CAN YOU WASH OFF TOXIC VALLUES IF YOU'RE USING TOXIC CHEMICALS YOU NOW THAT THAT ONE THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IT IS FELLD P H T H A L  T  S THAT'S WHY TOUND LIKE JOBIDON TAKING RIGHE THERE HAW DNOVER TO GERMYES RAZORIS TOT TOM TO GET GERMY'S SKIN CARE FOR FIFTEEN PER CENTS OFF TO DAY ALONG WITH ALL OF YOUR OTHER ESSENTIALS OR CAN MEANWHILE JOBIDON IS NOW ATTEMPTING TO PLAY REPUBLICAN HASITENS TO PASS THIS GIANT FOREIGN AID PACKAGE WHICH AGAIND HAS BUNCH ABAD ELEMENTS MAYBE TO MUCH AID FOR YOU CRANE DEPENDING ON WHAT EXACTLY IS THE ANGUAL HERE CERTAINLY TO MUCH AID FOR QUOTIN WHAT THE PALSTINIANS IN GOSI WHICH AGAIN UNSPECIFIED HOW THAT MONEY EVEN GETS INTO THE GOTSTRIP WHO TAKES IT THE AMERICAN TAXPAR SPONTS ARE PETTY MUCH ALL OF COMASES WEAPON RE TUNNEL BUILDING AND ALL THE REST OVER THE COURSE OFTHE PAST TWENTY YEARS SO SEEMS TO BE THE AMERICAN TAXPARE SHOULD STOP SUBSIDIZING ACTURAL TERREST GROUPS THOS AREALL GOOD REASONS OPPOSED THE FORIGNADE BILL WHEN IN FACT I THINK IT SHOLD BE PASSED BY THE HOUS IN PIECES I THINK THAT IF YOU ARE MI JOHNSON THE BEST PATHFORD IS PUT UP A CLEAN ISRAEL AID BILL SEPARATELY PUT BY CLEAN YOU CRANE A BILL OF THE SIZE THAT YOU THINK IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT GLANMER PUTENT FROM OVERUNNING KEEVE PUT THAT UP SEPARATELY FOR BUT CLEAN TIWAN AID BILL AND FORCE DEMOCRAS DEVOTE ON EACH ONE OF THOSE THINGS AND FORCE JOBIDING TO VETO EACH ONE OF THOSE THINGS THOW'D BE TH S MAR POLITICS HERE BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS THAT THERE IS A MAJORITY PROPOSITION FOUR FOREIGN AID ON ECH OF THESE THINGS LIKE JUST AS E POLITICAL MATTER IS LIKE AN EIGHTY TWENTY MATTER THAT MOST AMERICANS BELIEVE THAT THE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT THAT AMERICA HAS PROVIDED TO ISRAEL IS EITHER RIGHT OR NEEDS TO BE INCREASED WHEN I COMES TO THE AMOUNT OF FOREIGN AID THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO YOU CRANE THEY'RE STILL IS A BROAD MAJORITY THAT BELIEVES THAT ENOUGH FOR AN AGE SOULD BE PROVIDED TO YOU CRANES THAT RUSSI OESN'T TAKE IT OVER IF THAT'S THE PROPOSITION AND THEN THE QUESSION IS HOW MUCH AID THAT ACTUALLY IS ANWAY IT'S PENDS UT OF COURSE I KNAWL THESE POLLES ON HIV YOU ASKED THE QUESTION WEWE SAY SHOULD YOU CRANE GET MORE AID MANY AMERICANS WILL SAY NO IF YOU SAY IF BLADMERPOOTEN WILL TAKE OVER YOU CRANE IF THEY DON'T GET MORE AID SHOULD OU CRAN' GET MORE AID MOST AMERICANS WILL HEN TO YES WHEN IT COMES TO TI WANT THAT IS A BROAD MAJORITY PROPOSITION MOST AMERICANS BELIEVE THAT TI WAN SHOD BE ARMED ENOUGH TO REPELL A CHINESE INVASION OR CHINESE BLOCKEAD AND SO YOUN PASS ALL THOSE ENDAPENDENTLY BOWED WE PAT FORD FORT MY JOHNSON FORCE THE DEMOCRATS TO THE FLOOR ON THIS ONE A BUT BECAUSE NO ONE'S BEEN CLEAR BOUT THEIR POSITION THAT ALLOWS TOBIDIN TO GET OUT THERE AND SLORE HIS WORDS ABOUT ALL THAT'STO YESTERDAY JOBIDIN DOES A PRESS CONFERENCE IT WAS LITERALLY IF IVEBIN A PRESS CONFERENCE TOOK NO QUESTIONS HE'S DODTERING HE IS NOT SOLID HERE HET WAS YESTERDAY THE WAY WORK IS WE SUPPLY YORAN WITH NO O FROM OUR STOCKPILE NOW WE STAND OUR MONEY REPLENISIN O STOCKPILE SO I NOICARY HAS ACCES STOCKIL IN A MAD RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA BY AMERICA WORKERS A UM I DON'T AN KNOW IT WHAT HE MEANS BY LET IN HE DOESN'T TAK ENGLISH ANY MORE BUT AGAIN HE'SN'T TIRE STICK IS HE BELIEVES THAT IF HE YELLS IT REPUBLICANS ABOUT POUTON THAT'S CON TO HAVE THE SAME IMPACT AS REPUBLICANS YELLING AT HIM BYT EMIGRATION I REALLY DON'T THINK THAST THE CASE HERE HE WAS YESTERDAY  SUGGESTING THE REPUBLICANS HAVE TURNED PROPOUTEN NI SND HOUSE MABER HOUSO PUBLICANS TE GOT I SI ARGUNA STAND A FOR TREEDEM IGANA SID WIT CARIN CERNY E STAND WIT YOU CRANSO SANI POUTEN WE STN WIT AMERICA OR CHUM OBE AN DEMOCRAT IN SNI CAN TOGENE TE SANA ASINIIN THE WORLD STANT O HOUS O CUBLICN DO SANT IN PAS I STO IMMEDIATELY STAND ERGICIOUS ET WHAT STANTE DEMOCCRACY SAND UP O SO CALLLY TO HELP AN A WEKIN AMERICAN SECURITY AY LE LEA THESE SORTS OF TRUISMS WHERE E SAYS TENIFORFOR IM SAA ITIN IDON'T LIKE THAT SORT OF STUFF WHEN YE TALK FORIN POLICY FORM POLICIES ABOUT HARD HEADED AMERICAN INTERESTS THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHULDN'T BACK COUNTRY'S THAT AT OURE MORE PRO AMERICAN OVER COUNTRIES THAT ARE MORE ANTI AMERICAN WE SHOULD GENERALLY SPEAKING IT DOESN'TMEAN WE SHOULDN'T BACK LIBERTY WHEN WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO THAT'S TRU ALSO BUT LET'S BE REAL ABOUT THIS THE REASON THAT WE ARE BACKING YOU CRANE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST POUTEN ITS FOR VERY STRONG GEO POLITICAL REASONS YOU WANT A THROW CHINA OFF THE BALL WITH REGARD TO INVADING TI WAN YOUN A WEEKEN THE RUSSIAN MILITARIES THAT PROVIDED LESS OF AN ALLY TO THE CHINESE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT RUSSII CAN'T SPREAD IT'S TENTACLES INTO AFRICA IN THE IDDLE EAST YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT RUSSIA DOESN'T HAVE IT'S EYES ON POLANS OR ON LITHUANI OR LOTVIA OR A STONIA AND THESE ARE ALL GOOD GEO POLITICAL REASONS VERY FEW OF THEM HAVE TO DO WHAT THIS KIN OF BR AD NOGRESY AND'LIKE THAT SORT OF STUFF BECAUSE AGAIN THERE'S OUR ARGUMENTS THAT AS WE SUSTAIN LOSCALL PROVE TOO MUCH THEI'RE MANY DEMOCRACIES THAT ARE UNDER THRET IN THE WORLD TOESN'T MEAN THAT NECESSARILTYE UNITED STATES HAS A ROLE AND ALL OF THAT TERE LOTS OF PLACE WERE BAD STUFF ITS HAPPENING DOES MEAN THE UNITED STATES HAS A ROLE AND ALL OF THAT EITHER THIS HAPPENS TO BE A PLACE WHERE THE UNITED STATES CAN SIGN A REASONABLE CHECK AND ONT TAXETY BILLION IS THE SIZE THAT REASONABLE CHECK BUT IN ANY CASE REPUBLICAN LACK OF CLARITY OPENS THE DOOR TO BIDING BEING ABLE TO DO THE SORT OF PROPAGANDIZING AND YOU CAN SEE THAT I CHUCK SUMER WAS OUT THEIRE YESTERDAY PROMOTING THE IDEA THAT ISIS ONE ON MOST CONSEQUENTIAL BILLS IN AMERICAN HISTORY WHICH I I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS LONG NIGHT ALONG WEEK END AND A LONG FEW MONTHS BUT A NEW DAYS HERE AND OUR EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MORE THEN WORTH IT TO DAY WE WITNESSED ONE OF THE MOST HISTORIC AND CONSEQUENTIAL BILLS HAVE EFFORT HAS THE SENATE IT CERTAINLY BEEN YEARS PERHAPS DECATDES SINCE THE SENATE HAS THE BILL THAT'S SO GREATLY IN PATS NOT JUST OUR NATIONAL SECURITY NOT JUST THE SECURITY OF OUR ALLIES BUT THE SECURITY OF WESTERN DEMOCRACY A GAS SI AGAIN THA THA THE SORT OF GAME THAT HE'S PLAYING HERE WRITSEI THAT THIS BILL OR NOTHING THAT THIS ORT O BINARY STUPIDITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN PARTICULARLY DONE NOW WHAT'S GOIN T HAPPEN IN THE HOUSE O MIKE JOHNSON HAS SAID THAT HE HAS NO INTENTION OF BRINGING THE BILLS CURENTLY STANDS UP FRA FOR A VOTE ON THE FLOOR AND AS I SAY I THINK THAT HE'S JUST CARVE ID UP AND PROVIDE PIECE MEAL BILLS FOR EACH ONE OF THESE PRIORITIES FIRST PALLI TEN TE LIKE THAT ANYWAY DN'T LIKE I'M NABUS PACKAGES THAS IMONABUS PACKAGES TEN O BE CRAPSANDWICHES S I BE MUCH HAPPIER WITH SINGLE ISSUE BILLS THAT PEOPLE THT DEVOTE UP OR DOWN ON YOU DO'T WANT AD FOR ISRAEL FINE VOTE ON IT YOU DN'T WANT ADE FOR YOU CRANE FINE VOTE ON IT MIGHT JUST DO IT THAT WAY BUT THERE IS ANOTHER WAY THAT THE HOUSE COULD THE ORETICALLY GO ROUND MIKE JOHNSON IS SOMETHING WORTH CONSIDERING AS JUST A POSSIBILITY AND THAT IS A DISCHARGED PETITION SO GET READY THE'S I THINK DEMOCRATS ACTUONABLE POBLY TRY TO PRACY THIS A DISCHARGE PIT   PETITION WOULD REQUIRE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE MAJORITY TO FORCE CONSIDERATION OF A PIECE OF LEGISLATION ON THE FLOOR SO ASSENTIALLY YOU GET A PECE PAPER EVERYBODY SINDS IT YET TWO HUNDRED DEMOCRATS AND TAK TWENTY REPUBLICANS INTHE HOUSE TO SIGN THE FE'S PAPER AND THEN IT MOVES FORWARD THROUGH THIS ARDUOUS PROCESS AND HE MAJORITY EFFECTIVALLY LOSES CONTROL OF THE FLOOR UNLIKELY IT MOVES FORWARD THAT WAY BECAUSE AGAIN I DON'T THINK DEMOCRATS ACTOUN WANT THIS THING PASSD I THNK DEMOCRTS WOULD PREFER TO USE IT AS SOMETHING TO RUN ON TDEMOCRATS ARE ACCUSING REPUBLICANS OF THAT WITH REGARD TO AN EMIGRATION BILL THERE IS I THNK A GRAIN OF OF SOME TRUTH TO THAT I THINK IT' TELL SOR TRUE FOR DEMOCRATS IV THINK DEMOCRATS RIGHT NOW WOULD PREFER TO SEE RE PUBLICANS KILL THES THING IN THE HOUSE S THEY CAN THEN RUN ON THE IDEA THAT AMERICANS ARE WEEK UNNATIONAL SECURITY WHICH IS WHY IT BEHOVES REPUBLICANS TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT AND WHAT THEY DO NOT WANT AND RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE A FRACTURED NARRATIVE FROM REPUBLICANS OVER THE FOREIGNADE ARE THEY DOING IT BECAUSE IT' ACTUAY DON'T MIND PUTTING RUNNING OVER YOU CRANE ARE THEY DOING IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT IS RAEL BIL TO FENINSOF AGAINST COMOSS OR ARE THEY SHING WERE SPENDING TO MUCH MONEY AND THEYRE SPENDING HAKS LIKE A TOMAS MASSEY OR LIKE A RAN PAUL OR ARE THEY SAYING THAT THEY WANT A GRANT FOR ANAY THAT YOU DON'T WANT AL THE CRAPIN BILL THEYE BEEN TOTALLY UN CLEAR ABOUT WHICH OF THESE PASS THEIR CHOOSING THAT'S A LOWING  DEMOCRATS TO SPIN THIS THING AOR CAN MEANWHILE SPEAKING OF REPUBLICANS NOT HANDLING POLITICS COMPATENTLY SO WE MENTIONED YESTERDAY THAT DONALD TRUMP WOULD LIKE TO SEE LARA TRUMP BECOME COCHAIR OF THE ARANCEY AND AS I MENTIONED YESTERDAY I DON'T REALLY KNOW LAR TRUMP LIKE IT ALGLTI'VE NEVER MET HER I DO'T BELIEVE IN OF ANYTHING GENS LAR TRUMP I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF DINASTIC POLITICS I JUST THINK IT'S WRONG AN BAD I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN ITS CLENTON I DN'T LIKE ONE IS BUSH AND I DON'T LIKE IT WHON ITS TRUMP EITHER I PARTICULARLY DON'T LIKE IT WHEN ENTIRE REPUBLICAN APPARATUSIS ARE MOBILIZED IN FAVOR OF ONE MAN AT THE EXPENSE OF YOU KNOW CONSERVATIVE VICTORY ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE ARANSEE IS NOT JUST SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE SUPER PACKS SY THE PRESIDENT HAS OWN CAMPAGN FUNRASING APPARATUS THE ARNSE IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT CONGRESSIONAL RACES YOU KNOW IT'S CONGRESS MATTERS AND SENATE RACES BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE SENATE MATTERS BEL LARA TRUMP SHE IS OUT THERE YIF IF'S THEREPUBLICAN PARTY IS BASICALLY JUST PLEDGE PET PLEDGE FEALTY AN ALLEGIANCE TO DONALD TRUMP THAT'S NOT A PARTY ANY MORE IT ISN'T AND IT'S CERTAINLY OT A VEHICLE FOR VICTORY BECAUSE DONAL TRMP IS NOT POPULAR ENOUGH TO DO THAT DEMOCRAT'S BY WHD TRIED THE SAME THING WITH BROKABAMA AND IT FAILED PARTIES DO NOT SUCCEED WHEN THEY ARE NOT COALITIONAL PARTIES MUST BE COLITIONAL THEY MUST INCLUDE PEOPLE WHAR LUKUARMON TRUMP OR EVEN COLD ON TRUMP BUT WE'LL VOTE WITH TRUMP EIGHTY FIVE TO NINETY PER CENT OF THE TIME SO TAKING ALL OF YOUR CAMPAIGN RESOURCES AND DIRECTING THEM TOWARD A PRESIDENTIAL AND FORGETTING ABOUT YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATIVE BODY WE'RE ALL LEGISLATION COMMENCES THAT'S A MISTAKE BUT THA'S WHAT TLAR R TRUMP WAS SAYING SHOOSE LITERALLY OUT THER YESTERDAY AS THE POSSIBLE CO CHAIR OF THE ARANSEE  SUGGESTING THAT EVERY TIME RAISED BY THE ARANS SHE SHOULD GO INTO THE PESIDENTIAL RACE WHICH IS WILD THAT IS NOT HOW THE HURANCEE IS SUPPOSED TO WORKIN BY THE WAY IT'S DOES WORK THAT WAY REPUBLICAN TO GET THEIR ASSISKICKED UP AND DOWN THE BALLAT HERE IS WHAT I CAN TELL YOU THE ARAN SEE NEEDS TO BE THE LEANEST MOST LETAL POLLITICAL FIGHTING MACHINE WE'VE EVER SEEN AN AMERICAN HISTORY THAT IS THE GOAL OVER THE NEXT NINE AN A HALF MONTH IF I AM ELECTED TO THIS POSITION I CAN ASSURE YOU THE'RE WILL NOT BE ANY WORE SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR WHATEVER EXORBITAN A NOT O MONEY IT WAS SPENT ON FLOWERS EVERY SINGLE PENNY WELL GO TO THE NUMBER ONE AND THE ONLY JOB OF THE ARAN SEETE THAT IS ELECTING DONALD JAY TRUMP AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND SAVING THIS COUNTRY GAY SO I'M THAT'S NOT WHAT THE ARANSY IS FOR THE ARNSE IS NOT JUST FOR GETTING TRUMP ELAT THED PRESIDENT IT'S ABOUT OTHER CANDIDATES AS WELL AND THE PROBLEM WITH THIS MENTALITY IS THAT WHAT IT MEANS HAVING SEEN HOW DONALD TRUMP RESPONDED TO THE LOSS OF MASSY PILLOP IN THE NEW YORK THREE RACE IF IT TURNS INTO THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT DONALD TRUMP INDORSES ARE THE PEOPLE THE ARANSEA BACKS AND THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO PLEDGE TOTAL FEALTY TO DONALD TRUMP ARE THE PEOPLE THAT THE ARANSEY BACKS THAT IS NOT IRRECIPE FOR SUCCESS AGAIN BHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE JUST POLITICALLY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE I WANT SEE DOWN TRUMP ITS PRESIDENT WITH A SOLID HOUSE MAJORITY AND A REPUBLICAN AND REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN SENTED AS WELL THAT IS MY TOP PRIORITY I JUST POLITICALLY SPEAKING I WANT TO SEE REPUBLICAN UNIFIED ELECTORAL COMMAND OF THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS THE EXECUTIR BRANCH OR GOVERNMENT ANYTHING THAT IS AN OBSTACLE TO THAT UP TO AN INCLUDING DECLARATIONS OF FEALTY DIRECTLY TO DOWNL TRUMP IS STUPID IF THE AREINSEE IS GON A RUN ITSELF THIS WAY THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO WIN AS PROOF OF THIS PROPOSITION I HAVE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND NOW TWENTY TWENTY THREE I'M NOT YOUR HOMMING MORELECTIONS WE HAVE TO RUN IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THAT DONEL TRUMP IS NOT IN FACT AND SHOULD NOT BE THE CENTER OF EVERY CONGRESSIONAL RACE EVERY CENTATE RACE THAT IS NOT A GOOD STRATEGY FOR VICTORY IN AN INCREDIBLY TIVERSE COUNTRY WITH A LOT OF CONGRESSIONALS DISTRACTS AND SENENSEEDS THAT THAT DO NOT SHARE ALL THE SAME PRIORITIES I'LL GET AB YOUR MITS IF I DO NOT COMMENT ON A CLIP THAT HAS BEEN MAKING THE ROUNDS TO DAY IT IS A CLIP A A TUCKER CARLESON I'M

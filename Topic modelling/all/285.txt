THEY WERE PROBABLY THINKING I THOUGHT THAT I THINK A LOT WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT IS UNCOMFORTABLE AND WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAS HAPPENING LIK JUST MAKE THE RIGHT KIND OF FACE OWISTE A RYE I JUS MAKE SURE YOUR FACE IS RIGHT I MEAN THE THE TRUTH OF IT IS THAT NOBODY HAS EVER MENTIONED IT AGAIN TO US TO THE STAY YET WHAT DID HE SAY AFTERWARDS NOTHING DO HE SAY THANK YOU NO NOT REALLY NOW THE HORRIBLE THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT PEOPLE MUST HAVE FELT LIKE WE WERE DOING SOMETHING PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE OR AGRESSIVE MADE AND AND THE SAD THING IS WE WERE COMPLETELY OBLIVIOUS AND I KNOW THAT THAT PROBABLY SOUNDS LIKE MAYBE IT'S NOT TRUE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY WE HAD SOME SORT OF THING WE WERE DOING PERHAPS BUT IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THAT AT ALL BUT I THINK THEN AFTER THAT COUPLE YEARS LATER WHEN WEV FIRST PERFORM THE SONG IN A SHOW I MIGHT HAVE SAID TO THE AUDIENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME OH ACTUALLY WE SANG THIS ONCE MY DAT'S WEDDING AND THEN THE THE ABSURDITY OF THAT REALLY HID US RIGHT IN AND ALSO THE SONG KIND OF TURNS INTO A COMEDY INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW THE BEAUTIFUL SONG THAT IT IS BUT HERE I RECORTING FROM ONE OF THOSE CONCERTS YES O  AN S IT'S WEAR THAT YOU CAN GET A SONG IIS PLAOUS COMEDY I MEAN PEOPLE GET HYSTERICAL WHEN THEY HEAR IT IN THAT CONTEXT WHICH MAKES IT OBVIOUS THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT IT NOW IT SEEM SOM TN SE TA BET YOU E OO TIN GAN GEE OIN O YO YOUTHI HERE'S THE OTHER THING ABOUT IT I DON'T KNOW I SHOULD SAY THIS BUT I MEAN ON THE ONE HAND IT'S A TERRIBLE THING TO SING IT A WEDDING AND AT THAT WEDDING BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S KIND OF THE PERFECT THING

YOU SAING UNCONSCIOUSLY MAYBE IT WAS THE PERFECT PICK FOR THE WEDDING RIGHT I'M STARTING TO CHANGE MY MIND ON THIS WHOLE THING AND SAY ID THAT YES OF COURSE WE MEANT TO SING THIS SONG I'M NOT AND I SEE WHAT IT'S ACTUALLY SAYING WHAT IT SAYS TO ME IF THERE IS A SUBCONSCIOUS MESSAGE THAT WE WERE AIMING AT LOUD N OR ELL SPEAK FOR MYSELF ME IS JUST YOU KNOW I SEE YOU I SEE WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TRUE AND I SEE YOUR PAIN AND AND WE WERE HAPPY FOR YOU THAT YOU FOUND SOMEBODY TO BE WITH SAYSI LUCY RODGH THE VERSION DESPERADO S ON THEIR ALBA MUD AN APPLES LUCY'S MOST RECENT ATOMIS LITTLE BEAST I DID BY

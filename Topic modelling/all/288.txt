HERE YOU ARE AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES THEM KIND OF JOYFUL THE JUST THINGS FOR THE PLEASURE OF SMALLNESS IT STARING AT SMALLNESS IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU LOOK AT ABROKALY AN YOU THINK ALL I'M A GINAN THIS IS A SMALL TREE IT'S THAT FEELING I'M ALLYS FOLTY SO YOU STILL HAVE THAT FOR YOU LOOK AT A BRACKUAY YO THINK IT'S LIKE A SMALL TREE I DON'T STILL HAVE THAT FEELING I USED E THE FEELING WHEN I WAS A CHILD I WILL NOTING O NO ONE HA TO YOU  YO MAYS N I PROGRAM SMALL THINGS CONSIDERED IF THERE IS OF PEOPLE OVERLOOKING WHAT IS SO GREAT ABOUT THE TINY THE MINISCULE THE PE WE THE BYTE SIZE AND THE TANSY WINSEE ALSO S VERY DRAMATIC EXAMPLES OF THE POWER OF SMALLNESS GOOING FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO END HELTH IN SURANCE AS WE KNOW IT FROM ILIANS OF PEOPLE TEY MEY BE EASY CHICAGO ITS THIS AMERICAN LIFE I MARE A GLASS MY VOICE FFECTED BY SOME SORT OF TINY TINY BUG THIS WEEK STAY WITH US A N COMING UP SORT SO I'LL GO WE GOT AN AMAL FROM A PHYSICIAN WHO WAS STARTING TO SEE A TREN THAT DISTURBED HER AMON HER PATIENTS SHE WENT IN A SKIN TO IT WETHAT I CONTRIBUTORS SCOT BROWN WOULD BE THE BEST PERSON FOR THE JOB FOR REASONS HAT TO BECOME QUEER AS HE PROCEEDS HERE SCOT SO THIS DOCTOR TOLD US THAT ALL THESE PARENTSHAVE BEEN COMING TO HER SCABS OF THEM SHE USED THE WORD INUNDATED WITH THE SAME PROBLEM THEIR KIDS WERE SHORT NOT DRAMATICALLY SHORT THEY WERE JUST BELOW AVERAGE HEITE FOR THEIR AGE WE'RE TALKING NINE TEN ELEVEN YEAR OLD KIDS AND WHAT THESE PARENTS WANTED WAS FOR THIS DOCTOR TO PRESCRIBE THEM HUMAN GROWTH HORMON INJECTIONS TO MAKE THEIR KIDS TALLER THESE ARE DAILY INJECTIONS THAT COST TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A YEAR IT'S USUALLY AFFLOENT PRIVILEGE FAMILIES THIS DOCTOR SAYS WHO ALREADY HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGES SHE WHENT AS FARAS TO CALL THE DESIRE FOR GROWTH HORMONE AMONG THESE FOLKS AN EPIDEMIC BECAUSE I'VE HAD PARENTS COME TO ME AND SAY EVERY ONE I KNOW IS S ON GROWTH HORMON THAT WAS AN ACTUAL QUOT EVERY ONE I KNOW IS ON THI STUFF OR IT'S ALL THE RAGE IN THIS ANONIMOUS COMMUNITY VERY AFFLUENT COMMUNITY THIS DOCTOR WANTED TO BE COMPLETELY ANOTOMOUS BY THE WAY SHE FEELS LIKE SHE'S WHISTLE BLOID IN FACT THIS ISN'T HER REAL VOICE WE SWOPTOR VOICS FOR AN ACTORS IN OUR RECORDING OF THE INTERVIU SINCE I CAN'T IDENTIFY HER I'LL REFER TO HER FROM HEREON AS SHORT THROAT ALL WE CAN SAY IS SHE'S A PEDIATRIC INTE CHRONOLOGIST THAT IS A CHILDREN'S DOCTOR SPECIALIZEING IN STUFF LIKE THI BEDESE IROYD PROBLEMS AND GROWTH SHE SAYS SHE GOT INTO MEDICINE TO TREAT SIK KIDS BUT FULLY HALF OF HER PATIENTS ARE COMING TO HER JUST FOR THE GROWTH PART SO PARENTS WILL YOU NOT FIND OUT ONE KIT IS BEING TREATED AND IS SEEN THAT THEIR CHILD BECAUSE THEIR BELOW AVERAGE NEED NEEDS O TO LIKE OH IF THEYRE DOING IT THEN AM I CAN BE MISSING OUT IN FACT I THINK THE PHRASE ONE MOMUSED WITH SOMETHING LIKE I'M JUST TRYING TO BE PROACTIVE AND WORRIED I DON'T MISS MY WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY THAT WINDOW IS REAL PARENTS HAVE TO STACTOR KIDS ON THE DRUG BY THE TIME THEIR HITTING PUBRITY SHORT THROAT HAS BEEN PRACTICING FOR BOUT SEVEN YEARS BUT SHE WORKS CLOSELY WITH OTHER DOCTORS WHO'VE BEEN AT IT FOR DECATES AND THEY DO SAY THAT IT'S GOTTEN MUCH MUCH WORSE LIKE THEY DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING LIKE THIS I MEAN ONE OF MY SENIOR COLLEGUES IT'S ALMOST LIKE SHE 'S SURPRISED EVERY TIME LIKE I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS KID CAME IN HERE LOOK AT THIS GROWTH CHART AND I WALK IN THE OFFICE TAT IT'S A KIT GROWING AT THE FORTY AVE PERCENTILE WITH PARENTS WHO ARE LIKE THE FORTY OF PERCENTILE FORTIETH PER CENTILE MEANING FORTY PER CENT OF THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IS SHORTER THAN THEY ARE SO JUST BELOW AVERAGE AND SHE'S LIKE CAN'T YAN'T BELIEVE THERE HERE FOR GROWTH AND AM LIKE YES I CAN BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE WERE SEE THIS IS LIKE EVERYDAY YOU CALL ME IN AND ARE LIKE FABRIGASIT BY THE SAME THING I HAD A CONVERSATION WHERE I HAD A PATIENT COMES TO ME HER SON WAS FIVE FAT SEVEN MAM WAS FI FOR DAD WAS FIVIN THEY WANTED TREATMENT IF YOU SAY SOMETHING IN THEM LIKE WILL HIS PREDICTED HEIGHT IS FIVE NINE YOU MIGHT GET A RESPONSE THAT SOMETHING LIKE WELL THAT'S AN ACCEPTABLE YOU'RE LAUGHING BUT THAT'S MY JOB IM I'M LAUGHING FOR SOMEBODY DIFFRENT R ISNS DO YOU GET IT NOW OH I GET IT I'VE GOT IN IN MY WHOLE LIFE THIS IS PROBABLY THE POINT IN THE STORY WHERE I SHOULD LEVEL WITH YOU IF I COULD GEORGO I'M JUST UNDER FIVE THREE WHICH PUTS ME RIGHT AROUND THE FIRST PER CENTILE OF AMERICAN MAILS BY HEIGHT SHORTER THAN NINETY NINE PER SENT OF THE MEN IN THIS COUNTRY FOR YEARS I THOUGT I WAS FIVE FOR SECOND PER CENTILE BUT A RECENT DOCTOR VISNIT CONFIRMED THAT I'DE BEEN ROUNDING UP I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THE SMALLEST GYING THE ROOM CONSISTENTLY SMALLER THAN OTHER KIDS FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER THERE' SOME DOWNSIDES SURE BUT I THINK IHAVE A PRETTY GOOD LIFE MY SUCCESS IS IN FAILURES I DO NOT LAY THEM AT THE TINY FEET OF MY SHORTNESS MY HEIGHT IS JUST ONE THING ABOUT ME NOT THETHING NOT THE DEFINING THING BUT RECENTLY I WROTE A YOUNG ADULL NOVEL ABOUT A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD BOY WHOSE FOUR FOOT ELEVEN AND STRUGGLIN WITH HIS IDENTITY AND I FOUND MYSELF THINKING EVERY DAY ABOUT BEING SHORT WHAT IT MEANT TO ME WHAT IT MIGHT AV MENT WHAT I MIGHT A MISS AND THEN I HEAR FROM THIS DOCTOR ABOUT ALL OF THESE PARENTS WHO THINK HAVING A SUN MY SIZE IS UNACCEPTABLE AND COME TO HER TO FIX IT TO FIX THEM SHORT THROAT TELLS THE FAMILIES WHO JUST ONE OF WEN HANDS THEIR KIDS HEIGHT THAT SHE WON'T DO THAT BUT THAT DOESN'TALWAYS STOP THEM THERE ARE SOME PRIVATE PRACTICE UM PEDIOTRIC UNDER CHONOLOGISTS IN OUR AREA WHO I MEAN THE PRASE I'VE USED IS LIKE I FEEL LIK THEY WOUL THY'VE GROWTH HORMON TO A ROCK IF YOU GOT SOME TOO LIKE SITTING PEOPLE DOWN AND LIKE GIVING THEM THE WORST CASE IN AREAL HIGH PREDICTION AND THEN BEING LIKE THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED AND THEN TREATING THEM OH SO LIKE THEIR CONSULT IS PART OF SAYING AS I YOU ON'T HAV THE SHORE T GET ERE YOU ON YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YE YOU DON'T WANT A HOBIT OH ABSOLUTELY THAT'S WHAT THE ERE I MEAN LIKE I KNOW THE PRESCRIBING PRACTICES OF ALL OTHER PEDS ANNOWS IN OUR AIRA BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE BOUNDS AROUND AND THEE DOCTOR SHOP AND THEY WANT OTHEIR OPINIONS AMONG THE THINGS THAT BOTHER HER THE MOST A LOT OF THE PARENTS SEEM OBLIVIOUS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF SIDE EFFECTS BUT REALLY THE BIGGEST BE IN SHORT THROWTS GROWTH HORMON BONNET IS THE FARINIS ASPECT THE FULL TREATMENT OVER FOUR OR FIVE YEARS CAN COST THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE AND EVEN THOUGH MOST OF THESE FAMILIES AR RICH THEY FIND WAYS TO GET IT COVERED BY INSURANCE WHEN SOME OF HER DIABETIC PATIENTS CAN'T EVEN GET THE LATEST INSOLENT POP COVERED SHE ALSO SAYS SHE SEEN RICH FAMILIES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PATIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMMS THE DRUG COMPANIES OFFERED O NEEDIOR FOULTS LIKE I HAVE SEEN AFFLUENT PATIENCE GET ON THESE QUOTAN QUOT PATIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMMES WHEN LIKE OKAT THIS THE TERRIBLE BUT SOMETIMES I WILL ZILLA THEIR HOUSE AND A'LL VELIC YOU LIVE IN SIX MILLION DOLLAR HOME AND YOU'R GETTING PATIENT ASSISTANCE FOR YOUR KIDS GROWTH HORMON GROS GRUS JUSTGRUSS IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY SHORT THROWAT DOES TREAT SOME KIDS WITH GROWTH HORMON KIDS WHO AREN'T PRODUCING ENOUGH OF IT OR ANY OF IT ON THEIR OWN THAT'S A SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEM BUT SHE'LL ALSO TREAT THEM IF A KID IS JUST GOING TO BE REALLY REALLY SHORT LIKE WAYWAY BELOW AVERAGE LIKE WAY DOWN IN THOSE BASEMENT PERSENTILES WHERE I AM USING GROWTH HRMONI'S COCHERIN KASES LIKE THIS ACCORDING TO THE F T E THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S A DIAGNOSIS FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME AND LEARNED ABOUT IT WHILE RESEARCHING MY BOOK IT'S CALLED IDIOPATHIC SHORT STATURE I ESSESS SOUND SCARRY BUT ALL IT MEANS IS I'M SHORT AND KNO ONE KNOWS ONE AND BECAUSE I FIT THAT DIAGNOSIS I COULD HAVE BEEN ONE A SHORT THROWTS PATIENTE SO YES EVEN OUR WHISTLE BLOWER WHO BELIEVES THIS STUFF IS OVER USED WOULD HAVE TREATED ME IF I'D COME TO HER IF MY PARENTS HAD WANTED AND IS ONE OF THOSE OTHER WISE HEALTHY KIDS WHOS JUST SHORT AND WHO KIND RESINCE THE USE OF THE WORD OTHERWISE I HAD ALL OF THIS LOOKS NOT A WHOLE LOT LIKE MEDICIN IT LOOKS COSMATIC LIKE A BOOTJOB FOR KIDS SHORT KIDS BUT BEFORE I WENT OFF ON A NAPOLEONIC RAGE BENDER OVER THE CLAIMS OT THIS ONE ROGE GROW DOCTOR I THOUGHT I'D RUN THOSE CLAIMS BY DOCTOR DAVID B ALLAN ANOTHER PEDIATRIC ANTER CHRONOLOGIST AND ARDUA BLY THE LEADING EXPERD ON THIS TOPIC HE SAT ON THE PANEL THAT WROWTE THE RECENT GUIDE LINES FOR GROWTHORMON TREATMENTS FOR KIDS SPEND WRITING PAPERS ABOUT IT FOR THREE DECATES SPECIFICALLY ABOUT IDIOPATHIC SHORT STATURE YOU ACTUALLY I MAY NOT TO GET PFERSONAL BUT A OUSOMEWLA YOU DOFIT T THE O DIAGNOSS YOU MA DID YOU JUST DIONOAS MAY OVER THE RE IT'S AMAZING I MAY NO'VE GOT LOT OF HIS FURIUS AHE SAID HE DIDN'T THINK UNNECESSARY GROWTH HORMON TREATMENTS FOR KIDS WAS AN EPIDEMIC PER SAY THE RELUCTANTS OF INSURENTS COMPANIES TO COVER SUCH AN EXPENSIVE AND IF HE TREATMENT KEEPS WIDESPREAD IS TAMP DOWN BUT SURE THERE ARE LOTS OF FAMILIES IN MORE IMAGE CONSCIOUS WEALTHY PLACES WHO PUT THEIR KIDS ON IT WHEN HE WRITES ABOUT USING GROWTH HORMON FOR HEIGHT NOT HEALTH THE PHRASE HE USESIS COSMETIC AND O CHRONOLOGY AND HE TOLD ME THIS STORY BACK IN THE DAY GROWTH HORMON WAS USED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON KIDS WHO WERE GROWTH HORMON DEFICIENT THE WAY YOU GIVE INSOLENT TO A DIBATIC AND THE ONLYE SORCE FOR THE STUFF BACK THEN WAS THE PE TUITARY GLANCE OF CADAVERS DAD PEOPLE SO THE SUPPLY WAS LIMITED ANFORTUNATELY BECAUSE IT CAME FROM CADAVERS SOME OF IT WAS TAINTED WITH THE BRAIN TO SEE SIMILAR TO MAD COWN ITWAS A FREE THING THIS WAS IN THA ATIES DOSENS OF YOUNG PEOPLE GOT SEC SOME OF THEM DIED BUT THAT SAME YEAR SYNTETIC GROWTH HORMON BECAME AVAILABLE  NOW THERE WAS LOTS OF THE STUFF LAP MADE SAFE FROM CONTAMINATION DOCTOR ALLAN TOLD ME IN MY PRODUCER SHOWN COLDS THAT THE DRUG INDUSTRY AND DOCTORS STARTED LOOKING AROUND FOR R OTHER USES LIKE SAY MAKING IDIOPATHICALLY SHORT KIDS LESS ITIAPATHICALLY SHORT YOU KNR READO YO PAST AC SHURT STATURE REALLY BECAME A THING ONCE THERE WAS GROWH HORMON A TREATMENT AVAILABLE IT MIGHT WORK AN METER WAS A DESCRIPTIVE TERM YOU COURSES BEEN A DESCRIPTIVE TERM FOR LONGLONG TIME BUT AS HE DIGNOSIS AN I THINK IT WAS MORE REALLY AFTER THERE WAS A TREATMENT AVAILABLE IT'S ONE OF THESE SITUATIONS WHERE IT'S ALMOST LIKE A TREATMENT THAT'S IN SEARCH OF A DIGNOSIS YOU KNOW SO YE SOA SO AA SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEN SORT OF YE STRUC E JANGLING AND ALSO WHY ARE WE TREATING SHORTNESS LIKE ITS A DISEASE BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK INTO IT AS RESEARCHERS HAVE THERE'S NO EVIDENCE TIME BEING SHORT TO HAVING A BAD LIFE STUDIES SHOW SHORT KIDS GET TEASED BULLIED THE'RE OFTEN TREATED AS YOUNGER THAN THEY ARE BUT THERE'S NO DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN BEING SMALL AND FAILING AT LIFE I FOR INSTANCE DID NOT AND OT DEBRESSTON ALONE LIVING ANY TINY CARDBOARD BOX BEHIND BOB'S BIGWOY AT LEAST NOT BECAUSE OF MY HEIGHT ANOTHER THING DOCTOR ALLAN SAID IS THAT THE USE OF SYNTHETIC GROWTH HORMON IN KIDS IS GENERALLY AGREED TO BE SAFE BUT HE SAID IT JUST HASN'T BEEN ON THE MARKET LONG ENOUGH FOR US TO KNOW YET THERE COULD BE AN INCREASED RISK OF CANCER DOWN THE ROAD ONE STUDY AND ONLY ONE POINTS TO MORE INSTANCES OF STROKE AMONG A DULTS WHO TOOK THE DRUG'S CHILDREN THING IS WE WON'T REALLY KNOW HOW DANGEROUS THE STUFF IS UNTIL THIRTY R FORTY OR FIFTY YEARS DOWN THE LINE ALSO ON AVERAGE KIDS WHO TAKE GRWTH HORMON MIGHT GAIN THREE INCHES A LITTLE LESS THAN HALF AN INCH PER YEAR BUT THAT'S AVERAGE YOURE HEIHDACH MAY VERY A LOT COULD BE MORE COULD BE LESS I'LL JUST NOTE THAT LESS THAN A LITTLE LESS THAN HALF AN INCH A YEAR WOULD BE A VERY SAD TITLE FOR A COUNTRYSONG THE DARKEST IRONY HERE IS DOCTOR ALLAN SAYS THE KIDS YOU THINK NEED THE DRUG THE MOST KIDS ARE SHORT PARENTS ARE THE ONES WHO BENEFIT THE LEAST AND IT'S CONCEIVABLE THAT THERE IS SOME RISKS THAT WERE DON'T YET KNOW ABOUT OR JUST LEARNING ABOUT IU O TWENTY YEARS DOWN THE ROAD THAT THIS COMPLETELY HEALTHY TEN YEAR OLD AS NOW BEEN EXPOSED TO YOU KNOW FOR A BENEFIT THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFICULTY YOU KNOW DOCUMENTI A ME TAT TO ME THAT'S THE CONNUNDROOM RIGHT NOT A CANNUNDROOM FOR ME THE HEALTH EFFECTS ARE UNKNOWN BENEFITS UN CERTAIN AND EVEN IF HE GET TALLER YOU'RE NOT NECESSARILY HAPPIER THEN I'M NOT PUTTING MY KID ON IT NOT FOR A MAXIMUM THREE INCHES TOTAL NOT FOR A HALF INCH A YEAR WHO WOULD CHOOSE THAT FOR THEIR KID I DECIDED TO FIND OUT YOU TO CALL I GROWTH HORMON GAIT SOM REOU TO CALLIN SNAPPY WE SHOULD DEFINITELY DO THAT IT'S FININ I CAN'T TELL YO ANY OF THESE FOLKS NAMES EITHER THERRE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I'LL CALL THE DAD JERAMY HE'S A DOCTOR HE'S

ALWAYS AN OUTLIER SO WHEN SHE FOUND OUT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HELP FIX THAT JUST FELT LIKE THE RIGHT CALL TO ME IT WAS A IT WAS JUST A MEDICAL TWICE THAIT IT WAS NEVER ESTHETIC IT JUST WAS MORE MEDICAL AND I DON'T KNOW F AT IT'S INTERESTING WE HAVE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VIEWS AND PERCEPTIONS AGAIN THIS IS JERIMY HE'S A DOCTOR SO YOU'D EXPECT HIM TO COME AT THIS FROM A MEDICAL NECESSITY POINT OF VIEW TOO AND HE DOES BUT HE'S TOTALLY UPFRONT ABOUT HIS LESS DOCTORY REASONS I JUST STARIGET A BIT ON MA GUILE I WANT HIM TO BE BIG AND STRONG AND IF HE CAN BE SBIGGER AND STRONGER SO BUT TO

THIS KIND OF SITUATION AS SINGULARITY WHERE THE MATH IS NOT WELL BEHAVED IN FACT IT STOPS MAKING CENTS THERE SINGULARITIES INSIDE BLACK HOLES BUT IT NEVER HEARD OF A REAL WORLD EXAMPLE OUTSIDE OF THAT UNTIL DECEMBER FOURTEENTH LAST YEAR MOR THAT BROUGHT HELTH CURATE THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HASE BEEN STRUCK DOWN BY A US JUDGE JUDGE HAS RULED I UNCONSTITUTIONAL MAY BE REMEMBER THIS I KNOW E JUDGE IN TAXES RULED THAT THE ENTIRE A FORDABLE CAREACT VIOLATED THE U S CONSTITUTION THIS IS BIG NEWS AND IT IMMEDIATELY GOT APPEALED BUT THE SIGNATURE DOMESTIC POLICY ACHIEVEMENT OF THE ENTIRE OBOM OF PRESIDENCY THE THING THAT RIGHT NOW IS GIVING MILLIONS OF AMERICAN'S HEALTH INSURANCE THAT WHOLE THING THES JUDGE WAS SAYING IT WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL HAD TO GO AND THE THING THAT SET AL THIS OFF A ZERO LAST YEAR CONGRESS REDUCE TO POENTY TAX FOR NOT HAVING HEALPING SURANCE TO ZERO THE JUDGE RULED THAT WITHOUT THEMAN EXPLAIN HOW ZERO COULD BLOVE AN ENTIRE LAW WHEN OBOMA CARE THE AFFORDABLE CHARACT WAS WRITTEN ALMOST A DECATE AGO IT INCLUDED THIS THING THAT PEOPLE CALLD THE MANDATE WHICH BASICALLY SAID YOU HAVE TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE AND IF YOU DON'T YOU GOT TO PAY A FINE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE AVERAGE FINE PAID WAS A LITTLE OVER SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS OPPONENTS OF THE HEALTH CAROLAW TOOK ISSUE WITH THAT PART SAYING THE GOVERNMENT CAN'TCH JUST FORCE PEOPLE TO BUY SOMETHING THEY MADE OUT WANT ALL THIS WENT TOF THE SUPREME COURT WHICH RULED IT WAS O KA BECAUS AND THIS IS KEY THE MANDADE COULD BE VIEWED AS A TAX THE GOVERNMENT HAS LOTS A TAXES THIS IS ONE OF THEM WHICH FELT LIKE THE END OF IT AND IT WAS UNTIL THIS OTHER THING HAPPENED THAT SEEMED UNRELATED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN REPUBLICANS PASS THEIR BIG TAXCUT THOUGH IN ONE OF THE TAXES IN THERE THAT THEY CUT THIS WAS JUST A SENTENCE WAS THE MANDATE THE FIND THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY IF YOU DON'T HAVE IN SHR RANCE THEY CUT IT TO ZERO IT REALLY DOES SEEM LIKE MOST LAWMAKERS IN CONGRESS DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THIS ONE LITTLE CHANGE COULD BE THE BASIS FORGETTING ALL NINE HUNDRED PLUS PAGES OF THE ACA RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL I COULDN'T FIND ANY RECORD OF LAWMAKERS EVEN MENTIONING IT IN THE FLOOR DEBAYE AR NEWSCOVERAGE ONE PERSON WHO DID SEE THAT WHO PUT TOGETHER HOW ZERO COULD UNDER THE LAW WAS SOME ONE NOT IN WASHINGTON AT ALL E GIND WAS CONSETMECHA SATLAN WHO THEN WAS THE STATES SOLICITOR GENERAL I FOUND HIM ON FACE BOOK THIS PROFILE PICTURE WAS FROM AN ULTIMATE FRHISBITORIITPEOPLE LIGHTLY DECLINED TO COMMENT BUT FROM LEGAL FILINGS WE KNOW HIS BASIC ARGUMENT SATLAND'S LOGIC WAS THAT IF THE TAXES ZERO THEN THERE IS NO TAX AND WHAT YOUR LEFT WITH IN THE LAW IS THIS LINE THAT BASELY SAYS PEOPLE SHALL BUY HEALTH INSURNCE THAT WAS O KEIS PART OF A TAX LIKE YOU SHALL BY HEALTH INSURANCE OR PAY A PENALTY BUT NOW THE TAX WAS ZERO THE TAXE TOF THE LAW WAS SIMPLY TELLING PEOPLE TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE UNCONSTITUTIONAL THAT IS HOW A TAX OF ZERO ANDS UP IN A FEDERAL PEALSCOURT MOST OF T AMERICA IS KIND OF IN THE COURTROOM TOO TEIGHTEEN RED STATES ON ONE SIDE SIXTEEN BLUE STATES ON THE OTHER I REACHED OUT TO SOME ONE INVOLVED IN THE CASE NIC BAGLEY PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LAWSCHOOL I TALKED TO HIM ABOUT THE PART OF THE CASE THAT I FIND SO TRANSFIXING CAN IT CAN I SAY THAT THE PART THATS THAT STOOD OUT TO ME YE I USED TO WORK IN PHYSICS AND ITS LIKE WOU KNOW THE CALL HIS SINGULARITY LIKE IT'S ZEROAG THAT DENOMINATOR LIKE IT CREATES A BLACK HOLE YE I MEAN YOUR PUTTING YOUR FINGER ON ONE OF BAGLEY TO DECLEARE THINKS THE FIRST JUDGE GOT IT TOTALLY WRAW HE'S WORKED ON A BRIEF FILED IN THE APPEALS CASE AND HE'S BEEN WRITING ABOUT IT HE POINTED OUT SOMETHING I HONESTLY HAD NOT CONSIDER IT YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE ENCOURAGED AND OTHERS HAVE ENCOURAGED CONGRESS ZENRA AT LEAST THEHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO PASSA BILL THAT WOULD SET ONE DOLLAR TAX O REALLY YET THE HOUSE GOO A PASS THE BILL THAT MADE THIS UGAL THIS WHOLE OS SUIT GO AWAY TO MORROW AN  IT WOULDN'T BE IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE THE A THE JOT OF A PEN A AND YOU KNOW IF THE HOUSE PASSES IT AND THE SENATE DOESN'T WANT A PASS IT WELL YOU KNOW HANG THAT AROUND THE SENATE'S NECK AND THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION MAKE IT THERARE AL BATROSS TO CARRY WER WAIT WAY THAT A THAT WOULD WORK RIGHT IF THEY JUST SO ABSOLUTELY YE ABSOLOLL SANDS AT ALL CASE GOES AWAY IF THEY SAID IT TO A DOLLAR YETHERES A MUNCHE DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN DOR TENNY WOUL A ANY TORAY A PENNY SURE BUT E HOW CAN IT MATTER THAT IT'S A DOLLAR OR ZERO LIKE REALLY REALLY IT CAT IT CANT IN IT SHOULDN'T AND AGAIN IT YOU'R PUTTING YOUR FINGER O WELL I MAN UNDERSTAND THAT LEGALLY IT MIGHT BUT IT SEEMS CRAZY ALSO THAT IT MIGHT YET YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT THE LAW THE GRANT THINGS YE WEL WOUDIDN'T KNOW WHAT I MEAT WUT UIS THAT IS THAT IF IT SEEMS CRAZY TO YOU IT PROBABLY IS AND IF THE ARGUMENT IS TOO CUPE BY HALF IT PROBABLY IS I TALKED TO BAGLEY BACK IN JULY ON THE DAY THE APPEALS COURTER THE CASE WE LISTEND TOGETHER ON LINE A A THE ARGUMENTS THE LAWYERS MADE WERE AL ABOUT STANDINGS SEVERABILITY DOCTRINE AND MEANING AUTHORD SHALL  WHAT DID CONGRESS INTEND WHEN IT SET THE TAX TO ZERO WRS  HE DID NOT GO WELL FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARAT RAGLEY SID YYOUCULDELL FROM THE GENEROUS QUESTIONS BAGLEY'S EXACT WORDS WHILE WE LISTENED INCLUDEN THINGS LIKE OH JESUS AND THIS IS REALLY BAD THIS IS REALLY BAD AND FINALLY THIS IS ABOUT AS BAD AS YOU COULD EXPECT FROM A NORAL ARGUMENT THE HERO OR OR OR HE WAS TRULY SURPRISE HE THOUGHT THE LEGAL ARGUMENT THAT ZERO COULD TAKE DOWN THE WHOLE LAW WAS QUOTE WEAK TO THE POINT OF FRIVOLICINESS TO RANDY BARNET THOUGH THIS ALL SEEMS TOTALLY LOGICAL BARNET IS A PROFESSOR AT GEORGE TOWN LAW HAS BEEN VOCAL ON THE OTHER SIDE IF THE TAXIS ZERO BARNET SAYS THE MANDATES ONCONSTITUTIONAL HE DOSN'T THINK THE COURT CAN STRIKE OUT JUST THAT ONE PART OF THE LAW SO THE WHOLE THING HASK TO GO TO ME IT SEEMS QUITE REASONABLE BECAUSE IT'S A STRAIGHT FORWARD APPLICATION OF SEVERABILITY DOCTRINE AS I UNDERSTAND IT PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE FEEL LIKE THIS CASE IS AN EXAMPLE OF WE ARE LEGAL REASONING BEING USED TO GET TO A PARTICULAR CONCLUSION ARE THERE OTHER LEGAL DECISIONS THAT LOOK THAT WAY TO YOU I WOULD SAY THAT ANY DECISION THAT SAYS THAT CONGRESS HASS A POWER UNDER ITS POWER TO REGULATE COMMERSS AMONG THE SEVERAL STATES TO SHORT ANSWER YES WHICH IS TO SAY LIBERALS HAVE THEIR EXAMPLES OF WHAT THEY SEE AS ACTIVAST JUDGES INVENTING BAZAAR ARGUMENTS  AND SO DO CONSERVATIVES ON YOURO AND LIBERATARIANS LIKE BRANETT MAND EVERYONE ELSE HET TOLD ME ABOUT THIS CASE THAT HE ARGUED BEFORE THE SPREME COURT AND LOST SIX TO THREE YU ARE THE COURTRULE THAT A WOMAN IN CALIFORNIA IRS COULDN'T GROW MEDICAL MAROWANA O MIST AT OUR OWN HOUSE NEVER IN OUR OWN GARDEN ORSTITSTAKE FOR OUR OWN BACK PAN RAVILL NURSTA BECAUSE OF THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE CLAUSE AF THE CONSTITUTION THAT SOUNDS A LOOCRASY TO ME AND YET THOSE KINDS OF RULINGS HAPPEN ALL THE TIME GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE HOW MUCH YOUR TIME I'M I GOING TO GET I ASKED BARNETT WHAT HE MADE THE FACT THAT THIS CASE IS HOW WE ARE DECIDING WHETHER MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WILL HAVE HEALTH AN TRENS AND THAT IT ALL SEEM TO STAMIN SOME WAY FROM THE WEARD POWER OF ZERO DOES IT SEEM ODD TO YOU THAT WE ARE IN THIS POSITION A YOU DEFINE ODD WOULD YOU MEAN IT JUST SEEMS ODD THAT SOMEHOW THEREWOULD BE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CONGRESS SETTING A TAX TO A PENNY AND ZERO WHENEVER YOU HAVE A DISTINCTION AM THERE IS GOING TO BE MARTINAL CASES IN WHICH A THAT DISTINCTION COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE DISTINCTION COULD LOOK ARBITRARY THAT'S JUST THE WAY LAW WORKS IT WORKS OUT IT WORKS THAT WAY ALL THE TIME YOUR SPEEDING BY THE WAY WHEN YOU GO THIRTY SIX MILES AN HOUR AND A THIRTY FIVE MILE AND HOUR'S OWN BUT WHY IS THIRTY SIX MILES AN HOUR WHY WHY AS THAT A TERRIBLE SPEED WHEN THIRTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR IS PERFECTLY O CE FEELS LITTLE DIFFERENT SOMEHOW AM I MEAN YOU COULD SAY THAT TEIN IM NOIM NOT SURE HOW TO RESPOND TO TA   I'D LETT YOU HAVE TO ASK IT EITHER IT'S IT'S YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR FEELINGS ARE YOUR ENTITLE TO YOUR FEELINGS HERE ARE MY FEELINGS HAVING BIG THINGS LIKE THIS DECIDED IN THE COURTS AND LEGAL GROUNDS THAT MOST PEOPLE WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND IT DOES NOT SEEM IDEAL TO ME THE APPEALS COURT DISPOSED TO ISSUE ITS RULING ANY DAY NOW IT SEEMS QUITE POSSIBLE THIS THING IS HEADED FOR THE SUPREME COURT IT'S LIKE THIS LETTLE TAXK SET TO ZERO AS CREATED A LEGAL WORALL WITH THE RED STATES GATHERED ON ONE SIDE BLUE STATES ON THE OTHER A FOUR TAX OF HIGHLEVEL LEGAL MATH IN THE MIDDLE I

DOWN TO ONE MILIMETER THESE TINY BOLD CHARACTERS LAKE MINIATURE JAPANESE COLIGRAPHY BUT THE REA DIFFICALT CHACT IS THE DENCYT OF TLINS BECAUSE THERS NO DISTANCE BETWEEN THE LINS WRITE BE CAUSE IF THE

DIN'T YO SHOR THE FOM  THE WORLD HEU CAN'TS IDENTIFY THE INDIVIDUAL LETTERS BUT SOMEHOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM ALL TOGETHER SOMETIMES YOU CAN TELL WHAT IS SAYS A WORD WILL REVEAL ITSELF HE START WORKING ON AT FULL TIME WITH A PARTNER THEY'D SAID A TYPE WRITERS ACROSS FROM EACH OTHER IN A LITTLE ROOM FILLED WITH SIGARETTE SMOKE TENT OVER THESE MAGNIFYING GLASSES CALLED THREAD COUNTERS AND HY'D STARE AT THE WORTS WHEN THEY GET STUMPED ON A WORD ITCH HAPPEN CONSTANTLY THEY HAD THIS SYSTEM WHERE THEY'D RATTLE OFF GIBERISH AND RANDOM SYLLABLES BARONHAD AN THE OTHER GUY WOULD WORK SEPARATELY ON A SCRAP FOR A WHILE THEN THEY'D COMPARED THEIR GUESSES IF THEY HAD COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION THEY DECIDED IT WAS WRIHT THE PROJECT WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE FOUR YEARS AIY'D ENDED UP THINKING TONE TBARONHARD TED THE LAST SIX YEARS ALONE HE H'D STARTED WHEN HE WAS TWENTY ONE AND THN NISTERIN ISE FOR TY ONE AND WHEN HE'D FINALLY FINISHED THOSE FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX SCRAPS TURNEDED THE SIX VOLUMES SOWOR THE MIGHT GROW SCRIPTS TWO THOUSIN SOME PAGES OF STORIES COMITY LITTLE DRAMAS A NOVELL TOUT A ROBBER WHO DOESN'TS TEAL MUCH OF ANYTHING I HAD PICTURED THIS WRITING AS SAD LITTLE NOTES TO NO ONE BUT WHEN YOU READ IT IT'S LIKE WALZERS BACK  HAPPILY THROWING STONES WHEN HE WRITES AIVE NO USE FOR THESE SCRASPERS PLEASURE SEEKERS OVERLOOK LIFE'S TRUE PLEASURES TARAREN'T SERIOUS WHICH MAKES THEM BORING AND THEY CAN'T HELP BEING BORD WITH ME SINCE I'M PORT OT THEM SOME THINGS SCHOLARS HAVE FIGURED OUT WALZER WROTE MOST OF THESE SCRAPS BEFORE THE ASYLUM SO THIS ROMANTIC IDEA OF ONE MAN ALONE WRITING HIS MASTER PIECES WELL LOCKED AWAY SEEMS I GET DIDN'T HAPPEN THAT WAY ANIT SEEMS LIKE HE PROBABLY WASN'T SK AS A FRANIC BARN HAD TO STUDIED ALL THE MEDICAL RECORDS WALZER'S OWN DOCTOR THOUGHT HE WAS FINE AND SHOULD GO HOME SYCHITRIS WHO STUDY HIM NOW DON'T THINK HE WASKETS A FRENTIC EITHER HE NEARLY HAFE THE SYMPTOMS ALSO THAT THING HES FAMOUS FOR SAYING I'M NOT HEAR A WRITE I'M HERE TO BE MAD PEOPLE WHO STUDY HIM THINK HE LIKELY TODN'T SAY THAT THATIT'S A MYTH AND THAT THE TRUTH IS HE GOT TRAPPED THERE FOR THE MOST INFURIATINGLY MONDAYINE RESON MATICAL BURACRASY ONCE HE LOST HIS WRIHTS HE COULDN'T GET THEM BACK COULDN'T SIGN HIMSELF OUT AND DURING THE TWENTHE SEVEN YEARS HE WAS THERE LAT HAPPENED IN THE WORLD WELDWART TO THAT' ARE GLOOV WRITERS WHO MIGHT HAVEKNOWN HIS WORK HEOPLE MIGHT HAVE REMEMBERED THAT HE WAS THERE HAD SCATTERED THE'RE BOOKS WERE BAND THEY WERE LIVING IN EXILE OR DYING VIOLUNTLY COFKA'S FAMILY MEMBERS WERE KILLED IN THE HALLACOSS SO SOME WRITER NO ONE READ ANY MORE HAN NO ONE EVER REALLY KNEW IN THE FIRST PLACE HEOPLE AT OTHER THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT ONE SCHOLAR TOLD ME SHE THINKS THAT AT SOME POINT WALZER PROBABLY COULD HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF THE HOSPITAL IF HE WANTED TO THUT HE STOPPE TRYING I WONDERED WHY HE SPENT SO MANY YEARS WRITING THINGS THAT EVEN HE PROBABLY COULDN'T READ HE EXPLAINED TO SOME ONE IN THOSE YEARS WHEN HE WAS REALLY DEPRESSED WHEN PUBLISHERS DIDN'T WANT HIS WORK ANY MORE HE HAD BAD WRITERS BLOCK HE DESCRIBES IT AS A CRAMP IN HIS BRAIN AND HE EXPLAINS THAT WRITING THIS TINY HURTS SO HE CAN TAKE THE CRAMP IN HIS BRAIN AND PUT I INTO HIS HAND INSTEAD  ONCE HE DOES THAT HIS MIND IS CLEAR AND HE CAN THINK AG ON A PAGE OF A CALENDER HE'D CUT INTO PIECES HE WRITES ABOUT WHY HE DID AT ALL IN PENCIL ONE DAY HE FIGURED OUT BUT A PIND MADE HIM NERVOUS ALL THOS MISTAKES CROSS OUTS IN INK BUT IF HE USED THE PENCIL INSTEAD AND LABORED OVER THIS TINY WRITING HE EXPLAINS THIS LABOR LOOK TO ME LIKE A PLEASURE AS IT WERE I FELTER WOULD MAKE ME HEALTHY A SMILE OF SATISFACTION WOULD CREEP INTO MY SOUL EACH TIME LIKE A SMILE OF AMICABLE SELF TERISION IT SEEMS TO ME THE PENCIL LET ME WORK MORE DREAMILY PEACEFULLY COSILY CONTEMPLATIVELY I BELIEVE THAT THE PROCESS AD JUST DESCRIBED WOULD BLOSSOM INTO A PECULIAR FORM OF HAPPINESS THAT HIS HANTWRITING WAS SMALL HIS INCOST CONNECTION WITH HIS CONVICTIONS ABOUT LIFE AND THER WHIT IS INTERESTING IN LIFE HE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN GREAT IMPORTIONS AND THINKS WE CHAL BIK AND EVERYBODY KNEW ABOUT THE INTERESTING THINGS ARE THE SMALL THINGS THE IDEA I HAD HAD ABOUT HIS LIFE IN THE ASYLUM HOW HE DIED HOW AWFUL IT ALL SEEMED TO ME BARNHAR DOESN'T SEE IT THAT WAY HE STUDIED VALZAR HIS WHOLE LIFE EVERY LETTER AND DOCUMEN HEVEN ABOUT THE HOUSE WHERE VALZAR ONCE LIVED AND HE LIVES THERE NOW HE KNOWS HIS LIFE INSIDE AN OW AND HE THINKS IS NOT TRAGIC HE SAYS VALZER USUALLY SEEMS KIND OF VOQUET NOT HAPPY EXACTLY BUT CONTENT LIFE WITHOUT SUCCESS WALZER ONCE WROTE CAN ALSO BE BEAUTIFUL HIS WAS THERE'S POWER IN BEING OQUET WITH BEING AFHING IT'S HONEST AND HEU CAN'T CRUSH NOTHING HE MADE HIS LIFE SMALLER AND SMALLER UNTIL HE ALMOST DIDN'T EXISTS ANY MORE AND THEN HE

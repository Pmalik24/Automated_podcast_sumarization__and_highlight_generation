FORS TO GET TO COME OUT WAT COMES BACK OUT RUNS BACK OUT TO THE TABLE WITH A A PAPER BAG FILLED WITH PHOTOGRAPHS AND HE SAYS I KNOW THESE ARE PHOTOS FROM MY PATH WHEE SORTS LIKE SHOWING THE ALL THESE

IN THE BEGINNING AS A NEW IMPLY WITH NO EXPERIENCE TONA'S POWER WAS FER ATTRACTIVENESS TO DON SHE TRIED TO USE THAT TO HER ADVANTAGE IT WAS THE SAME POWER THAT A NATIA DID NOT WANT TO USE WHEN SHE

BECAUSE I WASN''T LIKE FREEKING OUT ABOUT THIS LATTER BUT LIKE THAT'S HOW I FELL YOU WERE LIKE NOT PERFORMING VICTIM OF SEXUAL HRYESYET I WAS JUST LIKE PERFORMING LIKE CHILD IN A ROOM LIKE I'M TWELVE AND YOU'RE N'N A DULL TALKING ABOUT LIKE MY BODY AND LIKE BOYS AND A SOMEONE COMFORTABLE LIKE I REMEMBER I EVEN LIKE ZIPPED MY HOODY U REALL TO REAL TIGHT ALLHWAY TO THE TOP CAUSE I THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD LIKE MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT LIKE MY BOOB SHELLING LIKE ER SOMETHING IT'S NOT LIKE CHRISTON COULDN'T IMAGINE SOME GIRL BEING UPSET BY THAT NOTE SHE COULD AND SHE COULD IMAGINE SOME GIRL MIGHT ENJOY THAT NOTE BUT SHE WAS THE GIRL SHE OWNED THE BOOBS THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT EVERY ONE WAS NOW TALKING ABOUT AT A ONE W AND THEN THERE WAS AGAEM THING IN THE AUDITORIOM AN THIS LIKE GIRLL WHO I DIDN'T KNOW AT ALL TAT DOW NACKS TO ME AND WAS LIKE A HEART ABOUT THE NOTE LIKE OUR UO Q AND LIKE ALL THAT KIND OF SHIT WAS JUST MAKING ME SO UNCOMFORTABLE I WAS JUST LIKE GAM FINE LIKE I DIDN'T CARE WHAT I REMEMBER CARING ABOUT WELL THE GUIDANCE COUNTSER FOR NOT SJUST LETTING IT BE A  STUPIDKID THING AND MAKING IT INTO LIKE AT AN ATTEMPTED RAPE OR SOMETHING IS THAT HOWFEL IT'S A BIT IT JUST FELT LIKE THEY WANTED ME TO UM CRY AND AND ACT LIKE IT WAS THE WORST LIKE THAT EVER HAPPENED ME AND I WAS SO VIOLATED WHEN CHRISTON WAS RAPED A FEW YEARS LATER IT TOOK HER A WHILE TO USE THAT WORD HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME IS WHAT CHRISTIN SAID AT FIRST WHEN THAT DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT SHE SAID HE'S AN ASSHOLE BUT THAT DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT EITHER SHE'D NO WORD TO SOMERISE THE EXPERIENCE SOME THING THAT I DIDN'T LIKE THAT WAS WRONG BUT IT WASN'T WHAT I IMAGINE DRAPE WOULD BE LIKE AND IT WASN'T AS GARY AS I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE SHE WAS AT HER FRIEND'S HOUSE FOR A PARTY IT WAS LATE PEOPLE WERE GOING TO SLEEP  SHE CLIMBED UP TO THE TOP OF A BUNK BED TO GET AWAY FROM AN OLDER GUY WHO WAS CREEPING HER OUT HRISTON WAS DRUNK SHE REMEMBERS HER FACE FELT NUMB SHE REMEMBERS HEARING SOME ONE BINGING ON THE DOOR WHICH SHE LEADER FOUND OUT HE HAD LOCKED BEFORE HE CLIMBED UP INTO THE BUNK BED AND TOOK HER CLOSHES OFF SHE SAID NO BUT HE HAD SECTS WITH HER ANYWAY SEX THAT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THE RAIHTWORD EITHER CHRISTON NOTISED HER FRIENDS DOING THE SAME THING DESCRIBING THER EXPERIENCES WITH BOYS IN DIFFERENT TONES IN DIFFERENT ARRANGEMENTS AND THEN THERE WAS THE FRIEND WHO WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL ATOUT WHAT HAPPENED EXCEPT SHE WAS UPSET AND DIDN ONE A TALK ABOUT IT AND EVENTUALLY SHE DID EXPLAIN HE SAID CAM I JUST PUT IT IN YOU FOR A SECOND HE FRIENDS HAD NO HE DID ANYWAY THAT'S WHEN CHRISTON SAID SHE FELT LIKE SHE HADN'T UNDERSTANDING TO SHARE ALL THOSE TIMES HENWE WERE MAD AT THOSE BOYS BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY DID TO US UM WE WERE MAD BECAUSE THEY RAPED YOU KNOW UM THEREWAS LIKE SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS WHERE IT TOUCK US A REALLY LONG TIME TO LIKE PUT THE WORD TO IT WHEN SHE ADDED THEM UP ALL THER EXPERIENCES CHRISTON FELT LIKE BOYS WERE AIMING THEIR BEHAVIOUR SO IT WOULD COME IN JUST UNDER THE LINE OF SOMETHING THAT HAD A NAME LIKE THEY'R PLAYING A GAME TO SEE WHAT THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IS THAT'S WHAT I KIND OF REALIZE FROM IT LIKE THE THE WAY THAT A GUY IS GOIN TO SCREEO OVER MOST LIKELY ISN'T GOING TO BE HE'S GON A RAPYOU IN AN ALLEY IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE MIGHT DOUBT AND IT'S NOT GOING TO LOOK LIKE THE WORST EXAMPLES OF THINGS OR THE MOST CLEAR CUT AND IT'S INTENTIONAL AND THASS WHY IT'S SCARRY LIKE THEY TELL THE ACTUALLY I THINK MAYBE THEYD DON'T Y THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT WHAT THEY DID WAS WRONG BECAUS IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE WHAT THEY CONSIDER RAPE SAMENS FOR YOU RAPE THE WORD WAS CONGRUENT WITH THE WAY SHE FELT ABOUT IT THAT SHE DECIDED WAS WHAT MATTERED AND I THINK MA BE MAYBE AFTER THAT I WAS JUST READY I DON'TKNOW I I WASN'T WAITING ANY MORE TO CALL SOMETHING WHAT IT WAS FOUR YEARS LATER CHRISTON MEANT DON AT A PROTEST GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE AND ACCEPTED A JAVIT ALL TO MIT SHE WAS TWENTY ONE ALTERN AUTS YOUNGEST IMPLOY DONE LOVED TO TELL THE STORY OF HOW THEY MET HOW HE'D FOUND HER ON THE SIDEWALK UM YET HE HE LIKED VERY MUCH THAT HE HAD DISCOVERED ME I DEFITLY GOT THE SEN THAT HE LIKED FEELING LIKE HE WAS DOING ME THIS HUGE FAVOR AND LIKE I WAS HIS PRODIGAY OR SOMETHING AND THEN IT EVOLVED FROM OH I FOUND HER ON THE SIDEWALK LIGIT WAS THIS CUTE THING TOO LIKE DON'T YOU DARE PUBLISH ANYWHERE ELSE AND THE AMOUND OF CONTROL THAT I REALIZED HE HAD OVER ME WAS UP WAS CONCERNING EARLY WHEN DONE INVATED HER TO MEET AT HIS APARTMENT CHRISTON DID NOT THINK AS TIN A HAD WELL THERE'S NO NEW YORK OFFICE SO THAT MAKES A CERTAIN HIM IN A SENSE CHRISTON THOUGHT I KNOW WHAT THIS IS I KNOW WHY HE WANTS ME HERE I KNOW WHY HE'S ORDERING SU SHE AND OFFERING ME WEED AND REPEATEDLY ASKING ME IF I LIKE HIS MUSIC AND HE WANTED ME TO HE LIKE THAT I WAS YOUNG AND THOUGHT I WAS LIKE COOL HE WAS HANGING OUT THIS YOUNG PERSON WHO LIKE BAS HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH HIM AND I THINK A LOT OF THE LIKE SHAMELESS WAY HE WOULD LOOK AT HER TALK ABOUT MY BODY WAS AWAY FOR HIM TO A KIND OF FORCE ME TO SEE HIM AS A SEXUAL BEING LIKE I'M NOT A SIXTY SOMETHING YOUR OLD MAN WITH NO SEXUALITY AND IF YOU THINK SO I'M GOIN TA PROVE TO YOU THAT I'M NOT BY FORCING YOU TO REALIZE THAT I DO HAVE I DO HAVE SEXUAL THOUGHTS AND URGES AND AND ALSO THERE ABOUT YOU A FRIEND SAID TO ME RECENTLY RELATING A DIFFERENT INCIDENT SHE SAID FORCING SOME ONE TO BE PART OF YOUR BONER AGAINST THEIR WILL IT'S JUST A SMARTER WAY OF FORCING SOME ONE I THOUGHT ABOUT CHRISTON WHEN SHE SAID THAT HOW ALERT CHRISTON WAS TO A VIOLATION THAT WAS NOT DEFINITELY OVER THE LINE CHRISTON FOUND IT ALARMING HOW LAD BACK DON WAS HOW HE BEHAVED AS IF THEIR INTERACTIONS WERE COMPLETELY NORMAL LIKE ONE DAY SHE SO WAS TO MEET WITH HIM IN A COFFEE SHOP DAWN AND SOME OTHER COLLEAGUES CHRISTON WARKED IN DON WAS ALREADY THERE I THINK I HAD PRETTY MUCH JUST SAT DOWN AND HE WAS LIKE ON HIS COMPUTER YOU KNOWS REAL CASUAL LIKE OH I I SAW SOME ONE ON THE INNER NAG SHE LOOKED JUST LIKE YOU HEM ME SHOW YOU WHEN HE'S LIKE PICKING HIS TINE PULLING UP THIS PICTURE AND IM LIKE O GOD WHAT A WHAT S WHAT AS GOOD AS HE GOING TO SHOW ME AND HE PULLS UP JUST A PICTURE OF A COMPLETELY MAKE ID WOMAN LIKE A PORN STAR O SOMETHING WAS LIKE FAKE BRASTON BLOND HAIR AND I WAS LIKE THAT I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE WHEN ELOOK ON MY FACE MUST HAVE BEEN LIKEMY RESPONSE WAS SHE LOOKS NOTHING LIKE ME CHRISTON STOOD UP SAID I'MINI GAV A CIGARETTE AND I WAS LIKE OH YAH COL O SO THIS YOU SEE EVERY BLOND CHICK IN THE PORN YOU WATCH FOR MINES YOU HAV ME GREAT THIS BEHAVIOUR HAD A NAME SEXUAL HARASSMEN CHRISTON DID NOT DOUBT IT I ALWAYS KNEW WIT WAS WRONG IT WASN'T LIKE I EVER A THOUGHT IS THIS NORMAL LIKE I NI KNEW TH NOW THIS IS NOT NORMAL AND AND IS BAT BUT HAVING A NAME FOR THIS BEHAVIOUR DIDN'T SOVE ANYTHING FOR CHRISTON IT JUST MADE HER ANGRY BECAUSE IT'SEEMLIKE THERE WAS NOTHING SHE COULD DO ABOUT IT SHE HAD NO PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE NO CONNECTIONS IN THE INDUSTRY N SHE NEEDED THE JOP I YE SO ALWAYS ONLY VET KNOW IF I SHOULD SAY THIS I USED TO  LIKE TO TALK ABOUT FAN TO SEES OF KIDNAPPING HIM AND LIKE TORTURING HIM AND IM LIKE FORCING HIM TO TRANSFOR MONEY INTO MY BANK ACCOWN AND BUT YOU KNOW I WOULD JUS ALWAYS JOKE ABOUT LIKE THE THINGS I WOULD DO TO THAT MAN THAT WOULD JUST MAKE HIM  FEEL UNCOMFORTABL AND TERRIFI I THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO DO MORE THAN ANYTHING CHRISTON'S REVENGE FAN TO SEE IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PLOT OF THE MOVING NINE TO FIVE WHICH CHRISTON HAS NEVER SEEN BECAUSE IT CAME OUT IN NINETEEN EIGTY BEFORE SHE WAS BORN ALL OF WHICH IS TO SAY THIS IS AN OLD STORY HRIST 'S ANGER BLET I GLED INTO HER THOUGHTS FOR WOR SHE REMEMBERS BEING AT A CONFERENCE AND INTERVIEING AN OLDER MAN GUYING HIS SEVENTIES ABOUT DRUG POLICY AND AT THE END I SAID I WAS GOING TO SMOKE A

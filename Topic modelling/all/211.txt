GUESSES WE HAVE TWO STORIES TO DAY WITH HIGH STAKES AND COMPLICATED CHOICES STAY WITH US ACT ONE FIRST DO NO HARM LET'S START RIGHT IN WITH A CALM RATIONAL PERSON A SESSING A NEW REALITY GETTING A FEEL FOR WHAT IT MEANS AND DECIDING WHAT TO DO MEEK MIK REPORTS AMELIA HUNTSBURGER HAS THE STORY SHE TELLS ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WORK AT A SMALL RURAL HOSPITAL SHE'S AN OBE JU I AN A NORTHERN IGH TO HO AN A PLACE CALLED SANDPOINT AN EARLY ON SHE GOT CALLED DOWN TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM TO EXAMINE A WOMAN THE WOMAN HAD PASSED OUT SHE WAS HEMERGINE A LOT OF BLOOD SHE WAS MISCARRYING ITER TO THE OPERATING ROOM AND I TRANSFUSED A BUNCH OF BLOOD PRODUCTS AND HER LABS WERE STARTING TO ME O THE ABNORMAL AND I ASKED FOR THE LAB TO GET ME PLATLETS THE NURSE SUPERVISE SIR WHO WAS ON THAT NIGHT SAID OH WE DON'T HAVE THOSE AND I SAID OH WE WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE ANY PLAITLETS OH NO WE DON'T HAVE THOSE IN THE BLOOD BANK HERE OH SO SHE TOLD ME THAT WE COULD GET THEM FROM SPOCAN AND I WAS LIKE GREAT WILL LETS LET'S ACTIVATE THAT RIGHT AWAY AND SHE SAID OH OQUET AH YET THEY COME BY TAXI BUT YELLOW CAB TAC RIGHT AND I SAID REALLY IS SERIOUSLY Y  WHAT PRODUCTS ARE ARE GOING TO BE PUT IN A CAB AND THEN COME TO THE HOSPITAL FROM SPOCAN WHICH IS AN HOUR AND HALF AWAY AND WHER IN THE WINTER THEN SHESIDYA TEO COME BY CAB MOST DOCTORS FRESH OFF YEARS OF TRAIN AT FANCY URBAN HOSPITALS MIGHT LOOK AT AN EXPERIENCE LIKE THIS AND WANT A RUN FROM M IT BUT FOR AMELIA THIS WAS HER PLAN HER FIRST CHOICE SHE GREW UP IN A PLACE LIKE SANDPOINT BEAUTIFUL RURL SURROUNDED BY MOUNTAINS SHE DID HER FIRST DELIVERY IN MIDDLE SCHOOL IT WAS A BABY LAMB SHE'S TO HELP ER DAD OUT DURING LAMMING SEASON AND ALL THROUGH MEDSCHOOL SHE WAS LIKE WHY SHOULDN'T PEOPLE IN RURAL PLACES GET THE BEST CARE AMELIA'S SOME ONE WHO GENERALLY TAKES STUFF ON IF IT NEEDS DOING WHENEVER THERE'S SOME UNPAID COMMITTEE JOBNEW ONE WANTS AMELIA SIGNS UP NOT AN EGO WAY IT'S MORE LIKE WHY WOULDN'T YOU DO THAT AMELIA'S HUSBAND THENTS HE WORKS AT THE SAME HOSPITAL HE'S AN E AR DOCTOR AND HE ALSO GREW UP IN A SMALL TOWN THEY MET IN MEDICAL SCHOOL AND WANTED TO SETTLE IN THE PLACE LIKE THIS BECAUSE THEY KNEW RURAL HOSPITALS DESPERATE LEADING DOCTORS YES PRACTICING MEDICINE HERE IN SANDPOINT MEANS PLATLET'S ARRIVED BY TAXI BUT ALSO AMELIA SAID YOU REALLY GET TO KNOW YOUR PATIENTS IT'S NICE RUNNING INTO THEM ALL OVER TOWN HALF ON THE DAYS PEOPLE THAT I KNOW IM TELIGHTED LIKE WHATER THE UPDAYS WHEN YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER COMING HOME WHEN SOMEBODY COMES UP TO ME AND WANTS IN THE GROCRY STORE AND WANTS TO HOSKA QUESTION A FASIONAL DISCHARGE THAT'S NOT ALSOM BUT WHEN A PATIENT COMES UP TO ME AND WANTS TO SHOW ME IN A HER GRANDCHILD WHO I DELIVERED THAT'S RLY DELIGHTFALL AMELIA'S WHOLE LIFE IS IN SANDPOINT SHE INVINTS HAVE RAISED ALL THREE OF THEIR KIDS HERE RECENTLY HER PARENTS MOVED HERE TO BUT I'VE BEEN TALKING TO AMILIA FOR MONTHS OVER THE PHONE AND A PERSON NOT BECAUSE SHE LOVES THE PLACE BUT BECAUSE SHE THINKS IT MIGHT IN TIME TO MEA AMELIA DID NOT SEE HERSELF AS AN ABORTION CARE PROVIDER SHE'S A GENERAL O B G IAN SO SHE SEES EVERYONE FROM TEANEGERS TO NINE YEAR OLDS SHE DOES PAPSMERS PRENATAL CARE RUST EXAMS AS TO IS PRESCRIBES BIRTH CONTROL DELIVERS BABIES SHE'S GOT THE BULLTON BOARD TO PROVE EN AND RIGHT NOW THERE ARE LOTS OF STORIES ABOUT PREGNANT PEOPLE DEALING WITH THE FALL OF ROVERSIS WAITE AND CHANGES IN STATE LAWS BUT THIS STORY IS ABOUT THEIR DOCTORS I STARTED CALLING O B G WIENNS WHEN THE SUPREME QUART OVERTURNED ROW BECAUSE I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THEIR DOBS OIR LIKE NOW AND HOW THEI'R CHANGING AN I STARTED HEARING ABOUT DOCTORS WHO WERE THINKING OF LEADING THEIR STATES BECAUSE OF NEW LAWS THAT CRIMINALIZE A WHOLE RANGE OF COMMON OB G WYANN CARE IDAHO IS ONE OF THOSE STATES IT PASS SOME OF THE MOST RESTRICTIVE ABORTION LAWS IN THE COUNTRY NO EXCEPTIONS FOR THE HEALTH OF A PREGNANT PERSON NO EXCEPTIONS TO SAVE THE LIFE OF A PREGNANT PERSON LIKE HEARE'S HOW STATE SENATOR TOD LAKEY ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL THAT WOULD SOON BECOME LAW TALKED ABOUT WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IN THE CASE OF FOR INSTANCE A SERIO'S PREGNANCY COMPLICATION I MI THE DECISIONS BY SOLLY ON A QUESTION OF SOMETHIME  POWT THEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TIKING A LIFE OF YOUN BORTRIL SO THAT WAYS MORE HEAVILY THAN SINC WE HA GED THINK YOU MISTER TERMEN IN JUST TO FALL UP SUCH AS A I GUESS YES I KNOW THE HEALP OF THE WOMAN'S IRRELEVANT YES OR AND OUT I WULD SATIT WAYS LEST YES THEN E THE WIFE OF THE TRA LOTS OF PEOPLE HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THE LAWS EVEN THE GOVERNOR WHO IS ANTI ABORTION SENT A LATTER TO THE STATE SENATE SAINE THAT SOME PARTS OF THESE BILLS WOULD QUOTE IN SHORT ORDER BE PROVIN BOTH UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND UNWISE HE SIGNED THEM INTO LAW ANYWAY IDAHOS NEW LAWS ARE ALSO SOME OF THE MOST PUNITIVE TOWARD DOCTORS THEY COVER ANY PREGNANC THAT HAS A QUO FEEDAL HEARTBEAT HOUGH IN THE EARLY STAGES IT'S NOT A HEARTBEAT IN A NORMAL SENSE IT'S ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY IN SOME TISSUE THAT WILL EVENTUALLY BECOME THE HEART THE SOUND YOU HERE WITH AN ULTROSON MACHINE IT'S CREATED BY THE MACHINE BUT THAT COUNTS AS FAR AS THE LAWS CONCERNED IF A DOCTOR DOES ANYTHING TO TERMINATE A PREGNANCY WITH A FEEDAL HEARTBEAT THEY CAN BE CHARGED WITH A FELONY AND IMPRISONED FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS EVEN IF SAY THEY HAVE A PASIENT WHO IS MISCARRYING BLEADING UN CONTROLLABLY AND THEI'RE TRYING TO STATE THEIR LIFE ALSO THERE'S THIS PHRASE AN ITA HOSE NEW LAWS A FIRMATIVE DEFENSE WHAT THIS MEANS IS IN THEORY THE LAWS DO ALLOW FOR ABORTIONS IN THE CASE OF RATE ANSAST OR TO SAVE THE LIFE OF A PREGNANT PERSON BUT IF A DOCTOR DOES THAT THEY CAN BE ARRESTED AND HAVE TO PROVE IN COURT WOULD SAY REPORT FROM THE POLICE AT TASTING TO RATE OR SOMEHOW PROOF THAT THEIR PATIENT WOULD HAVE DIED AND A JURY WOULD HAVE TO AGREAT UNDER IDAHOSE NEW LAWS IT'S KINDA LIKE DOCTORS ARE ASSUMED GUILTY INSTEAD OF ASSUMED INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY IT DOESN'T SOUND LEGAL BUT IT IS  WHEN THE ABORTION BAND WENT INTO A FACT AFTER ROW WAS OVER TURNED AMELIA'S FIRST THOUGT WAS NOT WE GOT TA LEAVE SANDPOINT SHE WAS NOT AT THAT STATE THE STAGE SHE WAS AT WAS LET'S FIGHT IF ENOUGH DOCTORS SPEAK OUT IF PEOPLE L UNDERSTAND THE REALITY THEY WILL UNDERSTAND THE DANGERS OF THESE LAWS AND THE' WANT A CHANGE THEM AMELIA WAS ALREADY ON A COMMITTEE TRACKING MATERNAL DUS THE STATE HADN'T HAD ONE OF THOSE SHE HELPED CREATE ONE SHE WAS ALSO HEADING OUP THE STATE CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTATRICS AND GINACOLOGISTS ACOG NO ONE ELSE RAISE THEIR HAND TO DO IT BUT AMELIA DID SO NATURALLY WHEN A LAW SUIT WAS FILED AGAINST ONE OF THE NEW ABORTION LAWS AND ITOHOE AMELIA WAS PART OF A COLLITION TRYING TO CHANGE THESE LAWS SHE KNEW THE LAWYER'S NEEDED TESTIMONY FROM OB G IENNS LAING OUT SPECIFIC EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE THEY'D BEEN PROVIDING FOR YEARS THAT NOW UNDER THE NEW LAWS WAS CRIMINAL SO I THINK O K WHILE I'MN A REACH OUT TO AS MANY OB JUIENS AS I CAN THINK OF AND HAVE CONTACT INFORMATION TO AND TE SEE IF ANYBODY WOULD BE WELLIND HE ARE TO MAKE A DECLARATION AND THEN I I CAN HAVE REALIZE I MYSELF HAVE PROVIDED CARELIKE THIS SO AMELIA WHO HAD STARTED OUT TRYING TO FIND OTHER OB G ENNS TO WRITE ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES TO HELP CHANGE THESE NEW LAWS INSTEAD STARTED WRITING ABOUT HERSELF HER OWN MEDICAL PRACTICSE SHE'D NEVER THOUGHT OF HERSELF IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS PROVIDERS OF SO CALLED ELECTOF ABORTIONS WHAT HAPPENS IN ABORTION CLINICS SHE THOUGHT OF THAT AS A DIFFERENT THING EVEN THOUGH SHE'D WRITTEN THE WORD ABORTION IN HER PATIENTS MEDICAL CHARTS FOR YEARS THE MEDICAL TERM FOR MISS CARRIAGES BEFORE TWENTY WEEKS IS SPONTANEOUS ABORTION ABOUT ONE AND FIVE PREGNACIES END THIS WAY SO SHE TREATS PATIENTE FOR THIS ALL THE TIME ANT I ABORTION RHETERIC HAD SO AFOCTIVELY SEPARATED ABORTION FROM HEALTH CARE THAT IN A WAY THEY'VE GOTTEN SEPARATED IN AMELIA'S HAD TO AMELIA SIGNED HER DECLARATION AND SUBMITTED IT HER WRITTEN EXPERIENCES AND THOSE OF OTHER OB G IENS IT ALL MADE A DIFFERENCE IN THE STRICTNESS OF THE LAW A SMALL BUT SIGNIFICANT ONE THE DAY BEFORE THE TRIGGER LAWS AND ITAHO WERE ABOUT TO GO INTO A FACTS A FATERAL JODGE AGREED TO ALLOW EMERGENCY ABORTION PROCEDURES THAT GO THROUGH ACTUAL EMERGENCY ROOMS FOR NOW DID THAT THE LIKE A BIG WIN YES TREMENDOUS RELIEF HOPEFUL YOU KNO THAT FELL LIKE O KE SOMEBODY IS REALLY SEEING THIS WITH A CLEAR I AN RATIONAL MIND AND IS LIKE WELL OBVIOUSLY THIS YETTHIS DOESN'T AKHE SENSE EVERY OTHER PART OF THE LAWS STILL WENT INTO EFFECT THE VERY NEXT DAY AND AROUND THAT TIME THE IDEA OF LEAVING POPPED INTO AMELIA'S MIND FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME SHE POPPED AT RITE BACK OUT HOLD UP WIKE PAUS LIKE LUSTROSE LUTRO SE LECH TO SEE EDEN THAT CIRCUMSTANCES AND ITAHO ARE NOT SET IN STONE THINGS ARE STILL CHANGING AND MOVING AND SO LET SEE KIND OF WARE THIS GOS SULY THIS IS CENIN B RAINED IN THIS IS THE SAME CALCULATION SOME OF THE OTHER DOCTORS I'VE TALKED TO OUR MEEKING WAIT AND SEE BUT ONE OF THE THINGS ARE ALL WEEDING INSEEN ABOUT IS WHO WILL BE THE FIRST OB G IENN PUT ON TRIAL AND POSSIBLY PUT IN PRISON FOR PROVIDING HEALTH CARE TO ONE OF THEIR PATIENTS AMELIA BACK AT WORK HAD A WHOLE BUNCH OF MESTOFF TO SORT HROUGH IN HER MIND WITH THESE LAWS THE NEW LAWS TO FIND ABORTION AS THE USE OF ANY MEANS TO INTENTIONLLY TERMINY A CLINICALLY DIAGNOSIBLE PREGNANCY SO ECTOPIC PREGNANCIES FOR EXAMPLE CAME UP ALL THE TIME IN HER CLINIC AN ECTOPIC PREGNANCY MEANS A FERTILIZE AG IS SITTING OUTSIDE OF THE UTERA S AND SOMETIMES HAS WHATH THE LAW CALLS A FEEDAL HEART BEAT IT'S NOT BIABLE IT CAN BE FATAL AND THE LONGER IT SITS THERE THE MORE DANGER THE PATIENT IS IN WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH A PATIENT LIKE THIS DO I NEED TO YOU KNOW PER THE TOTAL APORTION BEAN I NEE TO WAIT UNTIL SHE'S REALLY SICK I CAN'T ACT JUST TO PROTECT HER HEALTH I SHOULD BE WAITING UNTIL I'M SAVING HER LIFE THIS IS TOTALLY OPPOSITE OF MY MEDICAL TRAINING HER MEDICAL TRAINING WAS TRI O STOP THINGS BEFORE THEY BECOME LIFE THREATENING THE SOLUTION USED TO BE STRAIGHTFORWARD SHE'D REMOVE ECTOPIC PREGNANCIES WITH A QUICK SURGICAL PROCEDURE OR INJECT TO DRAG THAT WOULD END THE PREGNANCY ONE DAY AMELIA HAD A PATIENT LIKE THAT THEIR PREGNANCY TEST WAS POSITIVE BUT AMELIA COULD NOT FIND A FERTILIZED AG IN THEIR UDERES AN INJECTIENT WAS CLEARLY THE BEST OPTION SO WHILE THE PATIENT WAS IN THE EXAM ROOM AMELIA STARTED CALLING ADMITISTRATORS AT HER HOSPITAL ASKING CAN I DO THIS SHE LATER TALK TO SOME LAWYERS ABOUT WHAT SHE COULD DO IN THIS KIND OF SITUATION ONE AND SIR THAT I GOT WAS THAT IT'S PROBABLY NINETY PER CENT SAFE LEGALLY WHAT DOES THAT ME SO YOUR SAYING I HAVE A ONE IN TEN CHANCE OF SPENDING TWO YEARS IN JAIL WITH A PELONY IS AS OUT WHAT YOUR TELLING ME RIGHT NOW AND WHAT INTENDS SOUDS PRETTY RISKY RIGHT I GOT THREE KITS II MEAN WHAT THAT'S NOT REASSURING TO ME IT'S ALSO NOT A DEFINITE ANSER IT'S LIYOU KNO LIKE THAT AND THEN I HAVE ENAL ANOTHER LAWYER WHO I'VE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH WHO STAYS  TAKE CARE THE PATIENT DO IT YOU BEEN TRAIN TO DIA TAE CARE THE PATIENT AMELIA ADVISED HER PATIENT TO GO TO THE E ARE THE E ARE CHAOTIC IMPERSONAL AND USUALLY MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THE PATIENT BUT THAT'S THE ONLY WORK AROUND SHE HAD TA MAKE SURE THE PATIENT GOT THE CARITY NEEDED WHILE PROTECTING HERSELF UNDER THESE NEW LAWS AMELIA STARTED SENDING ALL OF HER ACTOPIC PREGNANCIES TO THE YAR  HERE'S ANOTHER THING AMELIA REALIZED ABOUT THE WAY THE LAWS ARE SET UP EVEN THOUGH E AR DOCTORS IN IDAHO SHOULD THEORETICALLY BE PROTECTED FROM CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS A PROSECUTOR COULD STILL DECIDE TO TRY AND CHARGE FOR HUSBANDVANTS ANYWAYS AND UNDER THE LAW AS IT STANDS PEOPLE CAN DEFINITELY SUE DOCTORS INCLUDING E AR DOCTORS FOR DAMAGES SO IT WAS DAWNING ON AMELIA THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT SHE AND VENS COULD PLE NOW BE SUED BY MULTIPLE FAMILY MEMBERS OF A QUOTE PREBORN CHILD THE FATHER OF THE PREBORN CHILD A GRAND PARENT OF THE PREBORN CHILD A SIBLING OF THE PREBRN CHILD OR AN ANT OR UNCLE OF THE PREBORN CHILD SO WHEN I READ THIS DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE FATHER OF A RPIST THAT THE SISTER OF RAPIS THAT THE BROTHER OF THE RAPST CAN SU THE PHYSICION IT ABSOLUTELY DOES FAMILY MEMBERS CAN EACH FILE INDIVIDUAL SEPARATE LAW SUITS ASKING FOR A MINIMUM OF TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND A HAVE UP TO FOUR YEARS TO FILO LAW SUIT I BACK TO LANGUAGE OF THE LAW STACH TRY DAMAGES IN AN AMOUNT NOT LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO JUST TAKE NOTE INSTEAD OF HAVING HERES THE SEALING THIS IS THE MAXIMUM WE START WITH A MINIMUM PAY OUT SO ALL OF THAT WAS ON AMELIA'S MIND WHEN ANOTHER PATIENT CAME INTO THE CLINIC SHE HAD AN ECTOPIC PREGNANCY THAT RUPTURED AMELIA PUT A CAMERA INTO HER PATIENC'S ABDAMENT AND I'M LIKE OH MY GOSH THERE IS WE MORE BLOOD THAN THERE WAS DESCRIBED ON THE ULTRESON THAT THIS PERSON HAD SIXTY MINUTES AGO LIKE WE HAVE GOT TO MOVE QUICKLY THE BLEEDING COULD KILL HER A THE WEIA STOPD THE BLEEDING WAS TO ABORT THE PRGNANCY WHICH WAS NEVER GOING TO BE VIABLE ANYWAY AN WHEN YOU DO SURGERY LIKE THAT OR IT'S AN EMERGENCY AN SOMEBODY'S HAVING ONGOING ACTIVE BLEEDING THAT'S ALREADY HIGH STRESS AND THAT'S HER HIGH STRESS LIKE A TRAINED FOR THAT I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT I CAN HANDLE THAT THEN YOU ADD IN THIS OTHER WE ARED LAYER OF LIKE IS HER BROTHER CAN AN NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WAS A NOT BIABLE PREGNANCY AND THAT HER LIFE WAS AT RISK AND LIKE WHAT ABOUT ER MOM WHAT ABOUT HER PARTNER WHAT ABOUT HER SISTER I  DO THESE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW SERIOUS THIS CONDITION IS OR DO THEY ONLY UNDERSTAND THAT I REMOVED A PREGNANCY THAT HAD A HEARD BEAN I DON'T KNOW HOW MIS WAS TO KNOW SHE STARTD LOOKING AT HER PATIENT'S CHARGS IS EVIDENCE SHE MIGHT EAT EN COR SHE WROTE DOWN WORDS LIKE LIFE THREATENING AND HIGH CHANCE OF MORTALITY FOR SOME THEORETICAL FUTURE LAWS SO ANOTHER CASE A PATIENT CAME IN TO SEE HER FOR A BIOPSY OF THE LIING OTHER UTERUS AMELIA FOUND HERSELF WORRYING WAIT WHAT IF SHE'S PREGNANT THE PERSON HAD MENTIONED THEY HADN'T BEEN USING CONTRACEPTION AND SO THEN I'M THINKING WILL WAIT A MINUTE WHEN WAS HER LASTMENSTRAL PERIOD LIKE ER DEFINALLY DOING YOU'RE IMPREGNANCY TASKET LIKE WHAT'S THE PLAUSIBILITY THAT THERE COULD BE A PREGNANCY THAT ISN'T DETECTABLE YET IN A SUPERSUPER EARLY STAGES AND SO IN THESE EARLY STAGES A PETEST IS NOT DEFINITIVE ET CAN STILL COME UP HIS NEGATIVE IF I HAD AT CORDERFORD EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT SOMEBODY SAID THERE'S NO WAY I PREGNA NAT YOU DOT HAS THE FOSED OR PREGNANCY TES THEN YOU KNOW IT BE RICH IF THERE WAS ANY CHANCE THAT THIS PATIENT WAS PREGNANT A BIOPSY COULD INADVERTLY TERMINATE THIS PATIENT'S POTENTIAL PREGNANCY SO THERE'S PARDONY THAT'S LIKE WE SHOULD NOT DO ANYTHING TO DAY SHE NEEDS TO USE A FACTIV CONTRACEPTION FOR A MONTH AND THEN COME BACK YOU KNOW AND THEN I CAN DO THIS PROSEDURE ONCE I'M REALLY SURE THAT SHE'S NOT PREGNANT BUT THAT'S ALSO REALLY IMPRACTICAL FOR THIS PERSON WHO 'S DRIVEN HOWRS TOO COME SEE ME AND FURTHER SHE HAS A MEDICAL PROBLEM THAT NEEDS ATTENTION SHE'S ALREADY WAITED TO SEE ME THIS VISIT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PREGNANCY AMELIA DIDN'T SEND HER BACK SHE TREATED HER THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS FOR AMELIA TO HAVE THESE LAWS IN HER HAD ALL THE TIME TO HAVE TO THINK OF EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO ENTERS OR OFFICE AS PREGNANT OR POSSIBLY PREGNANT TO HAVE THAT BECOME HER CONSTANT VOCUS MORE AND MORE SHE'S FINDING THAT WHAT SHE BELIEVES IS GOOD CARE THE KIND SHE'S OBLIGED TO PROVIDE UNDER MEDICAL MOUT PRACTICE LAWS IS INDERECT CONFLICT WITH WHAT THE NEW LAWS SAY AND SHE KNOWS THESE LAWS ARE IN HER PATIENT'S MINDS TOO BE CAUSE THEYR ASKING HER LIKET IN TROUBLE FOR THIS OR THAT IS THIS LEGAL WORRING ABOUT THAT ON TOP OF WHAT EVER ACTUAL MEDICAL PROBLEM THEY CAME TOR FOR IN OTHER STATES THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN NUMEROUS REPORTS ABOUT DOCTORS DELAYING CARE FOR PREGNANT PATIENCE OR EVEN TURNING THEM AWAY BECAUSE OF NEW LAWS CRIMINALIZING OBE JU I UN CARE SOME PATIENTS HAVDE ALMOST DIED AND ENDED UP IN THE ICY YOU AMELIAN HER HUSBAND FOR MONTHS WERE PINNING THEIR HOPES ON IDA WHO SUPREME COURT OVERTURNING THE STATES ABORTION LAWS THAT WAS THEIR BIGWAIT AN CY ON THE BACK OF HER MIND THERE WAS THIS GROWING NAGGING FEELING WILL WE BE ABLE TO KEEP LIVIN HERE IF THE COURTS DECISION DOESN'T GO OUR WAY OU I'M JUST LIKE SO AGITATED AS I'M DESCRIBING ALL OF THIS AND YOU LIKE THE INTENSITY LEVEL IS JUST SO HI FOR ME AND I MY FRIENDS SAYS WELL SO WHEN DO YOU JUST LIKE PUT THIS ALL DOWN AND JUST TAKE A BREAK AND I'M I'M THINKING LIKE WHAT IT WAS SHE MEAN TAKE RE HIKN TA RT YOU I'M LIKE LITERALLY VIBRATING OUT OF MY BODY I MEAN THAT'S ALSO A PROBLEM THAT INABILITY TO KIND OF ESCAPE THIS I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT IT DOWN YOU KNOW JUST SORT OF THIS LIKE WALKING ROUND AND LIKE AND WHETHER AT WORK OR AT HOME AND JUST LIKE THESE LIKE DEEP SIZES JUST FEELING LIKE THERE SAY TO IT WITHOUT EVEN LIKE IN A THINKING ABOUT IT SHE WAS HAVING TROUBLE SLEEPING A FIRST FOR HER YOU KNOW LAYING AWAKE AT AND THINKING ABOUT THIS OR THAT AND I THINK JUST LIKE THE TENSION THAT YOU'R HOLDING IN YOUR BODY OR HAPING TO THINK ABOUT TAKING A DEEP BREATH BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN HOLDING YOUR BREATH ALL DAY AMELIA INVINTS HAVE HAD SOME WILD CONVERSATIONS IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT BOTH OF THEM COULD NOT AVE BEEN JAIL OR FACE MULTIBLE LAWSUITS WITH POTTENTIALLY MASSIVE CIVIL PENALTIES OR LOSE THEIR MEDICAL LICENSES CHANCES ERE PROBABLY SMALL WELL ALSO IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BE SURE WHAT HAPPENS IF BOTH OF US ERE IN JAIL FOR TWO YEARS WHOIS RAISING OUR KIDS I MAN WE KNOW YE WE HAVE A PLAN FOR OUR KIDS LIKE IF THAT HAPPENED WHAT IS YOUR PLAN YOU KNOW FANLY SHE DIDN'T WANT TO SAY MORE ABOUT WHO EXACTLY THEIR KIDS ELEVEN EIGHT AND SIX YEARS OLD WOULD GO TO IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I'D SEEN HER LOOK PHYSICALLY UNCOMFORTABLE ANSWERING A QUESTION SHE KIND OF PIRST HER LIPS AND SOOK HER HEAD TO KNOW SHE JUST COULDN'T GO THERE OA COUPLE MONTHS AGO A FEW THINGS HAPPEN THAT MOVE THE IDEA OF LEADING FROM THE BACK OF AMELIA'S MINE TO THE FRONT THE FIRST TOOK PLACE IN A CAR PARKED OUTSIDE THE STATE CAPITAL AND BOISY SHE WAS WITH ANOTHER OB G WAYAN THEY'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE PEOPLE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ABOUT EXPANDING MEDICATE CAVERAGE FOR PEOPLE WHO JUST EVEN BIRTH SO THEY WERE SITTING IN AMELIA'S RENTAL CAR AND HER FRIEND TURNED TO HER AND SHE HAD TOLD ME AT THAT POINT THAT SHE WAS KIND OF JE SIHTING BETWEEN DEFERENT JOB OPTION JOB OPTIONS IN ANOTHER STATE THIS WAS A HUGE BLOW TO AMELIA SHE'D BEEN A KEY ALLY IN THE FIGHT THEN RITE UP FOR THAT CONVERSATION AMELIA CAUGHT UP WITH ANOTHER FRIEND A LAWYER WHO'D ALSO BEEN

IANS ANT ED JUST LEFT TAXUS THE OTHER TENNESSEE THEIR DOBS ARE DIFFERENT FROM AMELIAS BECAUSE THEIR HIGH RESCOBEES AND SO THEIR SEEN SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT CASES THEY TOLD ME THEY WERE JUST LIKE AMELIA WHEN NEW ABORTIAN LAWS WENT TO A FACT IN THEIR ESTATES THEY ALSO WANTED TO STAY AND THEY ALSO DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEIR TIPPING POINT WAS AND WANTED TO KEEP TREATING THEIR PATIENTS AND EACH OF THEM DESCRIBED THE SAME KIND OF MOMENT TO ME ONE DAY THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A TERRIBLE SITUATION WITH THE PATIENT BROUGHT ON BY TRYING TO COMPLY WITH THE NEW LAWS ONE OF THEM HAD TO SEND A PATIENT TO ANOTHER STATE IN AN AMBULANCE IT WAS A FIVE HOUR RIDE THE PATIENTS BLOOD PRUSSHAR WAS RISING  BY THE TIME SHE GOT TO A HOSPITAL HER KIDNEYS WERE STARTING TO FAIL THE OTHER DOCTOR HAD TO TURN AWAY A PATIENT PRAGNANT WITH TWINS ONE OF THE TWINS WAS GOING TO DIE AND THE DOCTOR NEEDED TO INTERVENE TO SAVE THE OTHERS LIFE BUT HE COULDN'T BECAUSE OF THE LAWS HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PATIENT BUT HE KNEW I NEED TO LEAVE MEKI MEK SHE'S ONE OF THE PRODUCERS OF OUR SHOW  B COMING UP IS THER STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON TELLING A FRIEND I THOUGHT YOU WERE AWAY OFF FACE WE'LL FIND OUT TOGETHER THAT'S IN A MINUTE FROM CHICAGO PUBLIC RADIO WHEN OUR PROGRAMM CONTINUES IT'S THIS AMERICAN LIFE I'M NANCY UPDIKE SITTING IN FOR IRA GLASS TO DAY SHOW WHEN TO LEAVE OR IF WERE AT AC TWO OF TWO AT TWO THE LEAVING EXPERT THE WHOLE IDEA FOR THIS SHOW CAME FROM ME READING A STORY BY MASHA GUESSEN A NEW YORKER STORY MASIA IS A STAFFWRITER THERE REPORTS A LOT ON RUSSIA AMONG MANY OTHER SUBJECTS MASHA GREW UP IN THE SOVIATE UNION THEN MOVED TO THE UNITED STATES AS A TEA NAGER AND LIVES HERE NOW THE NEW YORKER STORY WAS ALL ABOUT LEAVING ABOUT RUSSIANS LEAVING RUSSIA MASHA WAS JUST ABOUT TO BOARD A PLAIN TO RUSSIA WHEN RUSSIA INVADED OUCRANE A YEAR AGO AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER LANDING MASHA STARTED HEARING FROM PEOPLE FROM FRIENDS ABOUT LEAVING I'M TRY TO THINK WHO THE FIRST PERSON WAS I THINK IT WAS ASUALIVEARE O MY CLOSEST FRIENDS MI THINK THA THE CONVERSATION WAS SO YOU KNOW WE'RE THINKING OF LEAVING WER THING OM GETTING TO IS TO GEORGIA THERE HIS FAMILY IN GEORGIA O DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD GO NOW WERE IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS WHEN OUR SIXTEEN YEAR OLD GETS HER FOR IN TRAVEL PASSBORDS O WAS A SILL GOING TO BE VIABLE TO LEAVE IN A COPOF MONTHS WE'RE THEY GOING TO CLOSE THE BORDERS BUT IT' STILL FELT ALMOST ABSTRACT AND THEN LIKE A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER SHE SAID WE'RE LEAVING WEDNESDAY AND THEN WHILE MASHA WAS AT VER'S PLACE FOR THEIR GOOD BY GATHERING ANOTHER MUTUAL FRONT OF OURS CAN BY AND YOU A SORT OF WHY O FEEL YOU AFTALY LIKE WHATS O WAS THE BITIL MO THERE'S ALWAYS TIME NOT AN UNREASONABLE QUESTION MASIA THOUGHT AT THE TIME THAT NIGHT OVER NIGHT MORE LEAVING MASHA WENT TO THE LAST INDEPENDENT TELIVITION STATION IN RUSSIA TB RAIN AND SAW A WHOLE SCENE UNFOLDING STAFFERS AT THE STATION HAD GOTTEN WORD THAT THE PROSECUTORS OFFICE WAS INVESTIGATING TVY RAIN FOR QUOTE EXTREMEISM WHICH MEANT ANY ONE OF THEM COULD GO TO JAIL FOR YEARS STAFFERS ALSO HEARD THAT SPECIAL FORCES WERE COMING TO SEARCH THE STUDIOS OTHER MEDIA OUTLETS HAD BEEN SEARCHED BEFORE AND PEOPLE HAD BEEN ROUGH DUP SO STAFF MEMBERS WHO WERE AT THE STATION RAN OUT OF THE BUILDING SURHUDDLED IN A PUB OUTSIDE TRYING TO BOOK TICKETS ON THEIR SELPHONES SO THERE WAS LIKE THIS SORT OF COLLON RESPONDS WOR PEOPLE BISHCEK TO TOOK IDS YOU KNOW GRABBING THO I SI ASHAN ERE WASN'T IT  LOCKED  IT'S EVERY NIGHT OW THEY WENT ARCHING THEM OFF AT THIS SORT  BUT BUT YET THERS O THER ES OTHERE THER YET THERS N AN THEM AND A SENSE OF OF RUSHAN IS YOU KNOW VERY ADRENTLINY AND VERY DESPERATE AN TEN THE NEXT DAY I WENT TO VISIT OTHER FRIENDS AND THAT AND I WALKED IN AND I REALIZED OT THIS WAS THERE GOOD BY PART MAGAN AND AND SO THE FRIEND FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE THE ONE WHO HAD BEEN ASKING YOU KNOW ITS THE POINT WAS ALSO THERE A AND HE SAID I'M LEAVING TO MORROW AND THAT WAS JUST ENIT LIKE I MEAN HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS SHELL SHOCKED  BECAUS I THINK TAT SOMETHING HAD CHANGED INSIDE HIM THAT FROM ONE DAY TO THE NEW FROM ONE DAY TO THE NEXT AND HE WASN'T EVEN HE COULDN'T PROSSESS WHAT HAD CHANGE HE KNEW THAT CHANGE A HE KNEW HE WAS LEAVING AND HE WAS SHOCKED BY WHAT HE WAS DOING WITHIN A WEEK ALL OF MASHA'S FRIENDS HAD LEFT RUSSIA ALL OF THEM AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT THEYR UNNING FOR THEIR LIVES WHICH IS ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS OF THIS WHOLE EMIGRATION IS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ACUTELY WERE THAT THEY A THAT THEY ARE NOT RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES THAT THEYR IN FACT OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES AT THATS VERY SAME TIME IN YOUR CRAN BECAUSE OF THE SAME WOR E OM  BUT A BUT THAT THEYRE RUNNING TOTUSELVAGE THEIR SENSE OF SELVES TO BE ABLE TO BE IN THE WORLD IT'S HARD TO GAUGE HOW MANY RUSSIANS HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY IN LAST YEAR TENS OF THOUSANDS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS IT'S A LOT WHATEVER IT IS PEOPLE HAVE LEFT FOR ALL SORTS OF RESONCE ONE REASON NEW LAWS THERE WERE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT LAWS THAT THEY PASSED AM A WEEK AFTER THE FOSCE INVASION BEGAN ONE THAT MADE IT PUNISHABLE TO CALL THE WORE WERE ANOTHER WAS THAT MADE IT A CRIME TO DISCREDIT THEIR ARMED FORCES OF MORSH RA THAT'S WHENE TAT THAT'S ONE AS WIDE HE KNOWI LI ANGL WAS THAT YOU CAN DO THAT WITHOUT REALIZING THATS WHAT YOUR DOING  YOU KNOW IF SOMEBODY REALLY WANTS TO THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT RIGHT SO IN A WAY IT SOME MORE INSIDIOUS LAW THAN THAN THANEIN IT BECAUSE CALLING A MORE WORMIN THE UNOLITROS POS TO YOU NO YOU KNOIT OURE NOT SUPPOSE TOD IT BUT OF COURSE TERR WORKS MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY THROUGH LAWS THAT ARE THEY AND THAT COUNT POSSIBLY BE UNIFORMLY APPLIED  THEREIS ANOTHER REASON I WANTED TO TALK TO MASHA IN PARTICULAR ABOUT LEAVING MASHA IS A BIT OF A LEAVING EXPERT LIKE A SAD NOT JUST AS A REPORTER BUT IN THEIR OWN LIFE MASHA AS MOVED COUNTRIES THREE TIMES EACH TIME WITH NO IDEA IF THEY WOULD EVER LIVE THERE AGAIN THE FIRST TIME WAS WHEN MASHA WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD AND THE WHOLE FAMILY LEFT THIS OBE UNION TO COME TO AMERICA THEN MASHA MOVED BACK TO RUSSIA IN THE NINETIES THEY WENT IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE ON REPORTING ASSIGNMENT SO BI UNION WAS IN THE FINAL STAGES OF UNMAKING ITSELF AND WHAT WAS LEFT WAS THE MOST EXCITING PLACE ON EARTH TO MASIA IT WAS RUSSIA WE MAKING ITSELF MASIA ALSO FELT SOMETHING UNEXPECTED THERE THEY FELT AT HOME A PROFOUND EXPERIENCE AFTER SO LONG AWAY MASHA SPENT THE NEXT TWENTY TWO YEARS LIVING THERE LOVED IT NEVER WANTED TO LEAVE AND THEN MASIA DID LEAVE RUSSIA AND MOVE BACK HERE SEEING THEIR FRIENDS LEAVE NOW REMINDED MASIHA OF JUST HOW HARD THAT DECISION HAD BEEN TO KNOW WHEN TO LEAVE IT WAS ALSO ABOUT NEW LAWS EVEN WHEN THEY WERE CONSIDERING THE FIRSTS LA AGAINST SO CALLED ILLJABY CH PROPAGANDA TO MINERS IT SEEMED SO ABSURD IT THIS WAS BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE AND I WAS LIKE I SUPPOSED TO TESTIFY THIS WAS STILL AT A TIME WHEN ONE ONE LIKE SOMEONE LIKE ME MIGHT GO AND TESTIFYING THE HUMAN RICES COUNCIL AND THEN THE PORSON WHO WAS ORGANIZING THE HEARING SAID YE JUST ENTHERE'S NO WOTHER CAN A PASSIT WE'RE NOT GON HOLD O HEARING LISOLI THAT'S LET'S LET'S NOT DRAW MORE ATTENTION TO IT AND THEN OF COURSE THEY PASSED IT AND THE PARLIAMENTS ARY TALKING ABOUT REMOVING CHILDREN FROM FAMILIES AND I WENT TO PROTEST AND GOD BEATEN OUF AND YET ITIS NOT LIKE IT WAS NEWS RIGHT BUT HAD NEVER ACTUALLY BEEN BEATEN UP BEFORE SO I YOU THINK YOU WERE TIREDIT SPECIFICALLY OR AS AS DEFFLING  TARDIASPACIFICY A LIKE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT WITH THE POLICE LOOKING ON ITS ITS A PROFOUND EXPERIENCE EVEN IF YOU KNOW THAT THAT SORT OF THING HAPPENS TO TO OTHER PEOPLE A EVEN PEOPLE YOU KNOW AND AND THEN THE PASS A LAW BANNING A DOPTION BY PEOPLE WO ERE IN SAME SEX RELATIONSHIPS OR HAVE SIDANSHIPS OF COUNTRIES WERE SANE SEXMARIGOUS LYAND MY OLDEST SON IS IT OPTED SO THEN I WAS JUST LIKE YOU KNOWWE HAVE TO LEAVE  AND THAT NOW DESCRIBES YOU AND YOUR FAMILY SO SPECIFICALLY EXACTLY SO WE PUT MY OLDEST SON ON OPLANE AND THEN HOW WAS E HE WAS FORTUNE FOURTEEN IS THE SAME AGE MASIA WAS WHEN THE FAMILY LEFT THIS OBE UNION A WHOLE CYCLE OF LEAVING AND LEAING AGAIN MASIA TOLD ME THAT IN THE MIXE OF FEELINGS THEY HAD IN E LAST YEAR SEEING AND TALKING TO FRIENDS WHO LEFT RUSSIA IS A STRANGE KIND OF RELIEF AN E WAIT OU KNOW THE WORLD HAS BECOME KIND OF MENTALLY MORE A IT MAKES MORE SENSE IT WERRE YOU TO TO ME AND TO US AS AS A GROUP THAT WERE LIKE ON THE SAME SIDE OF NOT ONLY THE MENTAL BORDER BUT THE BUT THE PHYSICAL BORDER FOR YEARS AFTER MASIA LEFT WHILE FRIENDS STAYED MASIA SOMETIMES WONDERED WORRIED DID I MAKE THE RIGHT CALL BY LEAVING COULD I HAVE STAYED TO THERE WAS AN AGING THOUGHT OF LIKE A WOE MAY BE IT WAS POSSIBLE TO LIVE THERE AND SO MAY BE OVERACTED A MAYBE MAY THEY WAS HYSTERICAL ABOUT PUTZAN VANY IS TERRIBLE BUT HOW TERRIBLE IS HE AND NOW THE LOT OF THOUGHT IS JUST THAT'S THAT'S J THAS JUST GON LIKE HEIS ASTERIBLE AS AS AS AS ANYONE HAS EVER THAN A I WAS DEFFLY NOT HYSTERICAL AAND KNOW IT'S WASN'T ACTUALLY POSSIBLE TO EVELIZER AND O OUR PEOPLE SAYING THAT TO YOU LIKE AS ANY ONE SAYING TO YOU YOU KNOW I THOUGHT ACTUALLY WERE A LITTLE OFF THEY DEEP AD LIKE NOWND NOW I NOW I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN OR SOMELY YE YET PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT A AND AND IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I EVEN HEARD IT FROM PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T ACTUALLY SAY TO ME YOU KNOW YOURE CRAZY YEARS AGO BUT THOTS THAT I I THOUGHT YOU WERE A LITTLE BUT MAY BE OVEREACTING A LITTLE BUT I WAS WRONG AM THESE CONVERSATIONS JUST SEEMS SO STRANGE TO ME TO HAVE SOMEBODY SAY THAT AND TO I I DON'T KNOW IT SEEMED SO SAD THAT'S LIKE A YE KIND I WISH YOU WERE RIGHT I WISH I HADRELY ACTED EXACTLY AM AND I'MAN THAT WAS ALWAYS MY SORT OF GO TO PHRASE LIKE YOU KNOW I ILL BE REALLY HAPPY IF YOU PROVE ME WRONG YE YE BUT IN IT JUST IF IMD BEING EMOTIOALLY HONEST ABOUT IT AM YETS AS I DEAS OF COURSE I DON'T WISH I THEN I DON VER REACTED CAUSE THEY NOT OF REGRET I'D HAVE IF I DOE REACTED WOULD BE UNMANAGEABLE SO IT'S NOT LIKE I YOU IAM FULLO SHAGNAN FRAID FOR FOR FOR HAVING TOLD YOU SO AM BUT THERE IS I YET THERS AND ODD SORT OF EMOTIONAL PEACE AWITH HAVING THINGS FALLENTO PLACE I ASKED MACHA IF THEY EVER THINK ABOUT LEAVING THIS COUNTRY MI SHA HAD A FEW DIFFERENT ANSWERS TO THAT MY BRAIN BOOK MARKED THIS ONE  EMIN THI SEDENC SO YOU DISTENS WERE GREAT FOR SETTING DOWN RULES TO LIVE BY AND I THINK ONE OF THEIR RULES WAS A YOU ERE USELESS IN PRISON OR DEAD BUT AS LONG AS YOU ARE OT IN PRISONEDT WERE DEAD AND YOU ARE NOT YOU YOUARE NOT FACING A SIGNIFICANT RISC OF GOING TO PRISONER BEING DEAD MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHERE YOU ARE AM AN THUS A PRETTY LIKE THIS COUNTRY IS SO FAR FROM OUR LOSING THE ABILITY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE YE YE I GUESS I WONDER IF IF YOU IF YOU HAVE AN IAN ON LAWS CHANGING HERE I MEAN IT YOU KNOW LIES THAT WOULD FEEL THREATENING TO YOU ON PERSONALLY I MEN I THINK THAT WHEN A ONCE YOU'VE I'M A GEAT ET ONCE IN YOUR LIFE IT'S ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY SO YET IT'S YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH I I'M NOT ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT LEAVING THE UNITED STATES MIT'S NOT IT'S NOT A CRAZY POSSIBILITY FOR ME IT IT COULD HAPPEN A I TIN PERSONALLY UKNOWDS IT'S IT'S COMPLICATES IAVE KISS HERE AND DRA MER SO MI GROWN SO A SO THEN YOU BECOME OUNA YOU YOU START HAVING OTHER KINDS OF ROUTS AM BUT IF FOR EXAMPLE A AND THIS IS NOT ID IT'S HERRIBLE AN LIKELY SONARIA YOU KNOW IT BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE AM TO GET TORMEN TREATMENT IN THIS COUNTRY YOU KNOW THAT FOR ME WOULD BE A A QUESTION OF MY PERSONAL HEALTH AND I PROBABLY ACTUALLY HAVE TO LEAVE BHUT I FIRST EARD MAKING THIS YOW I IMAGINED IT BEING ABOUT LEAVING ALL SORTS OF PLACES BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT THE SAME PLACE HOME A PLACE YOU LAVE IF YOU'RE LUCKY YOU HAVE SOME CHOICE IN THE MATTER IN TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT MUT IT'S A CHOICE TO BREAK YOUR OWN HEART YOU   BYET I S NO ATISIS

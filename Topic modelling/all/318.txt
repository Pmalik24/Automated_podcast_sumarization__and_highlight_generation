TELL THEM TO MIND THEIR OWN BUSINESS I WASN'T SOME FREEK SHOW ODITY WHAT I WAS WAS A PRETENTIOUS DEUCHBAG WHO COULD NOT BE BOTHERED TO INTERACT WITH THE COMMON MAN KEVAN THAUGH WAS LIKE ENERGIZED BY BEING AROUND OTHER PEOPLE AND THE MORE THE MARRIER HE LOVED IT WHEN WE WERE IN THE BEECH TOWNS FULL OF AMERICAN TOURISTS AND IN THE SMALL VILLAGES HE'D FUMBLED THROUGH THE FEW SPANISH WORDS THAT HE KNEW AND START THESE INANE CONVERSATIONS WITH EVERYBODY IT GRATED ON ME I WASN'T MUCH BETTER ON THE ROAD DRIVING ON MOUNTAIN HIGHWAYS WAS FREEING UNNERVING ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT AND LOT OF THE TIME THE

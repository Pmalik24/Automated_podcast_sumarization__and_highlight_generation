AS AMERICA PREPARES FOR YET ANOTHER BRUTALLY FOUGHT CLOSE FOR AN ELECTION THE POTENTIAL CENSORS INCREASE THEIR VOLUME JILL BIDANS HAS POSITIVE FOR COVEN AND WE EXAMINE WHETHER DONALD TRUMPS OLD COLLEAGUES ARE ABOUT TO FLIP ON HIM I'M BENSHVER LISS IS THE VENSHVARRO SHOW TO DAY SHOWSPONTERBACKEXPRESS VIPIAN DO YOU LIKE YOUR RUB HISTORY BEING SEEN AND SOLD TO ADVERTISERS NOW ME NEITHER GAT EXPRESSBY PIAN RIGHT OUT EXPRESS BE PIANDI COM FLASH MEN WELL IN THE LAST ELECTION CYCLE THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF TALK ABOUT DISINFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION REMEMBER THERE'S A CONFLATION THAT OCCURED BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY FIRST IN TWENTY TWENTY THE STORY WAS DISINFORMATION THIS WAS THE RUSSIANS WERE MAIN LINING A BUNCH OF FOREIGN PROPAGANDA INTO AMERICA'S ELECTION AND THUS TWISTING THE ELECTION AGAINST THE WONDERFUL AND INNOCENT HILLERY CLINTIN AND FOR THE EVIL RUSSIAN STUGE DONALD TRUMP THAT WAS THE NARRATIVE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THEN A KIND OF BLED AWAY BEUS IT TURNS OUT THE DATA WASN'T THERE TO SUGGEST THAT IT LOOKD LIKE THE RUSSIANS HAD A BUNCH OF CRAPPY FACEBOOK PAGES THET NOT ALL THAT MANY PEOPLE SAW TAND SO INSTEAD THE MEDIA TURN TO THEIR NEW VARIANT OF DISINFORMATION WHICH WAS MISINFORMATION MISINFORMATION IS JUST STUFFED THE MEDIA DOESN'T LIKE BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S TRUE AND SOME TIMES IT'S FALSE BUT YE CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY THAT THE MEDIA TREATMENS INFORMATION AND THUS WHEN IT CAME TO TWENTY TWENTY THE ARGUMENT WAS FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE HUNTER BIDAN LAPTOP STORY WELL TET WASN'T QUITE DISINFORMATION COULD COULDN'T TELL IF IT CAMEFROM THE RUSSIANS BUT IT MIGHT BE MISINFORMATION AND BY MIS INFORMATION THEY JUST MEANT SOMETHING WE DON'T REALLY WANT YOU TO SEE AND EVERSINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE'S BEEN ALL TIS TALKIN SOCIAL MEDIA FEARS ABOUT THE STUFF THAT YOU SHOULD SEE IN TH STUFF THAT YOU SHOULDN'T SEE ALL THIS TALK ABOUT THE VAST PANOPLY OF MISINFORMATION THAT I'S GOING TO BE CRAM DOWN UPON YOU SO THAT YOU WON'T KNOW RIGHT FROM LEFT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO KNOW RIGHT FROM WRONG YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT'S TRUE AND WHAT IS FALSE AND THIS INVARIABLY RAMPS UP JUST BEFORE A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION BECAUSE WHAT THE MEDIA REALLY WANT YOU BELIEVE IS THAT THEY ARE THE ARBETTERS OF TRUTH THEY ARE THE ONCE WE'LL TELL YOU WHAT IS MISINFORMATION AND WHAT IS NOT MISINFORMATION F IT DOESN'T COME COURTESY OF THE WASHINGTON POST OR THE YORK TIMES IF IT COMES COURTESY INSTEAD OF SHOWS IT LIKE THIS ONE IT MUST BE MISINFORMATION AND TO PROVE THE POINT THE MEDIA AND IT'S VARIOUS ALLIED INTREST GROUPS THEY WILL LOBBY SOCIAL MEDIA TO SHUT DOWN OTHER OUTLETS TO REDUCE THEIR REACH THEY'LL USE THE SLOGAN IT LUT UKNO IT'S NOT FREEDOM OF SPEECH IT'S FREEDOM OF REACH AND THT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS FREEDOM OF REACH SUFF WE JUST DOWN GRADE THE DAILY WIRE WHILE UP GRATING NEW YORK TIMES WHILE WE'VE FOUGHT BACK AGAINST MISINFORMATION AND ONCE AGAIN MISINFORMATIONS OR LIKE HATE SPEECH REMAINS AN UNDEFINE TERM THERE'S CERTAIN STF TAT WE CAN ALL AGREE WOULD BE MISINFORMATION IF YOU SAY FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE WORLD IS FLAT THET' BE MISINFORMATION BUT ALSO THAT'S FAIRLY EASILY REBUTED TO HERE'S THE BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT MIS INFORMATION IT'S POSSIBLE TO REBUT VIRTUALLY ALL MIS INFORMATION WITH ACTUAL GOOD INFORMATION THE PROBEM FOR THE LEFT VERY OFTEN MEMBERS THEMAINSTREMETA IT' THEY DON'T WANT THEIR BAD INFORMATION OR BUTTED THEY DON'T LIKE THE COMMUNITY NOTES FEATURE ON TWITTER BECAUSE IT MIGHT SMACK THEM ONCE IN A WHILE WEL THE STARTING TO RAMP UP INANTICIPATION OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR BECAUSE AGAIN IF YOU LOOK OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARIES OF TRADITIONAL MEDIA YOU MIGHT NOTICE FOR EXAMPLE THAT JOBIDON IS NOT AN EMPATHETIC OLDER CHARACTER WITH A STURLING HISTORY OF WONDERFUL HONOR IN HIS OFFICE INSTEAD HE MIGHT LOOK LIKE A CAREER CORRUPT POLITITION WHO IS PLAJORIZED EVERYBODY IN SIGHT AND USED HIS POSITION OF POWER IN ORDER TO ENRICH HIMSELF IN HIS FAMILY HE MIGHT LOOK LIKE THAT IF HEU LOOK AT THE QUOTOQUOT MISINFORMATION SOURCES AND SO NOW THE MEDIA ARE RAMPING UP THE CALLS THE HUEAN CRY FOR SENSORSHIP IN ADVANCE OF THE TWENTY TWENTY FOR ELECTION AND NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SONS O THE SAME THNGIS TWENTY TWENTY THEIR JUST REPLAYING IT THE LATEST INDICATOR OF THIS IS A LONG PIECE FROM CHRISTIANO LEMA FROM THE WASHINGTON POST TIDDLED WHY A PERFECT STORM OF MISINFORMATION MAY LOOM IN TWENTY TWENTY FORT THIS ALSO BY THE WAY A BUILTS AN EXCUSE FOR WHYJOBIDON LOSES SO BIDN LOOSES THE ANSWER'S GOING TO BE NOT THAT HE WAS A BAD CANDIDATE NOT THAT YOU RAN A JERRY ATRIC DODTERING FOOL WHO CAN'T SPEW SENTENCES FROM HIS FACE HOLE A PERSON HAS A TERRIBLE ECONOMIC RECORD A PERSON WHO HAS ALL THE EMPATHY OF A COME CLOT THAT'S ON GONG TO BE YOUR FAULT DID CLOING BE THE FAULTS OF ALL THE MIS INFORMATION IT'S THE THE CORRUPT SITUATION WOULDN'T ALLOW JOBIDON TO WIN THE AREADY SETTING UP FOR THAT NARRATIVE AS WELL HERE IS WHAT THE HE SAYS A MAJORITY OF RESEARCHERS EXPECT GLOBALMIS INFORMATION TO WORSON AN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR BUT POLITICIONS AND SOCIAL MEDIO POSING VEMO SERIOUS THREATS ACCORDING TO A NEW SURVEY RELEASED TUESAS FIRST OF ALL THE ME JUST POINT OUT ARE YOU ARE YOU SYING THE POLITICIANS LIE SOMETIMES THAT THEY ARE NOT WHOLLY TRUTHFUL NO NO SPEAK NOT OF SUCH EVILS HONESTLY SO STUPID THE POLE WHICH SURVEYED ALMOST THREE HUNDRED RESEARCHERS ACROSS FIFTY COUNTRY'S FOUND THAT ONLY A SMALL FRACTION TWELVE PER CENT THINK THE INFORMATION INVIRONMENT IN THEIR COUNTRIES WILLIMPROVE NEXT YEAR FIFTY FOUR PER CENT SAID IT WOULD DETERIORATE THE INTERNATIONAL PANALON INFORMATION INVIRONMENT SAID THE SWISS IF THE SWISSBASE NONE GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION BEHIND THE SURVEY SAID THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATES SIGNIFICANT PESSIMISM AMONG THE EXPERTS A OL THE EXPERTS THEIR PASSMISTIC HES WOULD BE THE SAME EXPERTSWHO DECLARED THAT HUNDERBION'S LABTOP WAS ACTUALLY JUST A RUSSIAN PLANT OR SOMETHING THE FINDING'S ARRIVE IS PLATFORMS INCLUDING METTA AND ELON MUSK'S ACTS ROBACK POLICIES AND SCALEBACK TEAMS DEDICATED TO COMBATING THIS INFORMATION A HEAD OF MAJOR ELECTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES EUROPE IN INDIA NOW IS WORTH NOTING AT THIS POINT THAT AUTHORITARIAN STATES LIKE FOR EXAMPLE VENINS UHELA OR BORERLINE AUTHORITARIAN STATES LIKE SAY MEXICO TAT A RULE BY MEMBERS OF THE LEFT THE THE RULE OF LULA DISILVA IN BRAZIL THESE PEOPLE ARE VERY FROM THE TWARD SHUTTING DOWN QUONTIN QUOMIS INFORMATION IS THE INFORMATION NVIRONMENT IN BRAZIL GETTING STRONGER OR REAKER OVER THE COURSE OF LAST COUPLE O YEARS EVERSON'S LUIS ELECTION BY THE WAY AT THE STORY OF COURSE WAS THAT BOSINARO IS THE REAL AUTHORITERIAN WHILE LULA HASN'T EIN SHYBOUT SHUTTING DOWN HIS POLITICAL OPPOSITION IN BRAZIL IS JUST THE MEDIATE UN'T CARE ABOUT THAT AS THEY LIKE LULA PHILIP HOWARD SAYS HE IS THE PROFESSOR UNIVERSITY OF OXFORT AND SHARE OF THE I PIIE SAID QUOTE THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREAT A PERFECT STORM NEXT YEAR HE SAYS THAT STAFFING CUTS TO TECT COMPANY'S MODERATION FORCES POSED A HUGE RISK ACCORDING TO THE SURVEY TWO THIRDS OF RESEARCHERS SAID THE INABILITY TO HOLD SOLCIOMEDIAS COMPAET'S ACCOUNTABLE OVER BOCH CONTEN MODERATION EFFORTS POSED A SIGNIFICANT HURTLE FIFTY FIVE PER CENT REPORTED POORLY DONE AUDIMATED MODER ATION WAS ANOTHER SO ANOTHER WORDS THEY WANT TO BE ABLE SU GOVERNMENTS WANT TO BE ABLE TO SUE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES IN ORDER TO GET THEM TO DO THE THING THAT THEY THEMSELVES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO SO THE GOVERMENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS NOT ALLOWED TO SHUT YOU DOWN ON FREE SPEECH TERMS BUTYU WHAT THEY CAN DO THEY CAN PRESSURE YOU TUBE TO DO SO THENG PRESSURE FACEBOOK TO DO SO THEY PRESSURE ECS TO DO SO WHILE A THORD OF RESEARCHERS GLOBILY FLAG SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES AS ONE OF VEMOST SERIOUS THREATS TO HALTHY DISCOURSE THOSE THAT SPECIALIZE IN RECIONS WITH DEMOCRATIC GOVERMENTS SET POLITICIANS THEMSELVES POSED A BIGGER RISTS AND OF COURSE HERE THEY JUST MEAN RIGHT WING POLITICIANS I THEVE THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT THEY CARE ABOUT THIS IS

WOULD YOU LIKE IF THE GOVERNMENT SPENT MONEY ON ACTS IT TURNS OUT THAT EVERYBODY LIKE WHN THE GOVERNMENT SPENS MONEY ON ACTS BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK THE GOVERNMENT MAKES ITS OWN MONEY BUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE DON'T LIKE WOULD YOU LIKE THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE MONEY FROM YOU AND SPEND IT ON ATS THEN ALL THE NUMBERS GO THE SAMETHING HAPPENS TO BE TRUE WHEN IT COMES TO YOU KNOW THE LIKE THET PEOPLE ARE LIVING RIGHT NOW WHERE THEY'VE EXPERIENCED WAGE TWO IN FLATION ACTUAL DECLINES OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST O COUPLE OF YEARS IN VERY SIGNIFICANT WAYS EVERY DAY THINGS ARE COSTING MUCH MUCH MORE MONEY THE WASHINGTON POST IN FACT HAS A PIECE TO DAY TOGMOUT AUTO INSURANCE COST THE SORED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES  THESE ARE REAL WORLD PROBIS PEOPLE ARE HAVING AND A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH IN FLATION PREMIUMS ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON POST HAFE KEPT CLIMBING EVEN AS OTHER TYPESBEEN FLATION OF COOL ACCORDING TO THE BUREAUF LABORSTATISTICS CARINSURANCE FOR YOUS DRIVERS IN JULY WITH SIXTEEN PER

BY IN SURE TO MAKE UP FOR BIG PAY OUTS DRIVEN BY FLOODS AND NATURAL DISASTRS WHICH INSURES CATEGRIZE AS CATASTROPHE LOSSES AS WELL AND THERE'S NO ESCAPE FROM THE HIGHER PREMIUMS BECAUSE AGAIN WHEN COMES TO CARNTURNS YOUR MAN DATED TO GET YOUR CARINSURANCE OR YOU CANNOT DRIVE ON THE PUBLIC ROADS ALL OF THIS PEOPLE ARE TRIBUTING TO BINS A CONOMY WHICH MAKES ENS BECAUSE EVEN AS ALL THIS IS GOING ON JOBIDON IS SPILLING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HUNDREDS OF BILLINGS F DOLLARS INTO GREEN BUNDAGGLES AS THE WALLSTREE JOURNAL POINTS OUT ACCORDING TO OUR APORT LATE LAST MONTH BY THE YORK STATE ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY LARGE OFFS OR WIND DEVELOPERS ARE ASKING FOR AN AVERAGE FORTY EIGHT PER CENT PRICE ADJUSTMEN IN THEIR CONTRACTS TO COVERIZING COSTS THE ALINES FOR CLEAN ENERGY NEW

INCLUDE FEDERAL TAX CREDITS THAT CAN OFFSET FIFTY PER CENTS OF A PROJECT'S COSTS BUT A NUPLE DEVELOPERS SAY THEIR COSTS AR INCREASIN FASTER THAN IN FLATION AND THE PROJECTS WON'T BE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE AND WOULD BE UNABLE TO PROCEED TO CONSTRUCTION TO OPERATION UNDER THEIR EXISTING PRICING SO AGAIN THE WAY THAT'SCON O BE SOLVED YOU'D IMAGION IS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COMING IN AND SPENDING

E ECAUSE IT'S MOST OFTEN ACTUALLY AN UNDOING OF LIBERALISM I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED AS LIBERALS DO FOR EXAMPLE AND A COLOR BLIND SOCIETY THAT THE GOAL IS TO NOT SEE RACE AT ALL ANYWHERE FOR ANY RESON YES THAT'S WHAT LIBERALS ALWAYS BELIEVED ALL THE WAY THROUGH ABAMA GOING BACK CANEDY EVERYBODY MARN'T LOOTE THE KING THAT'S SON WHAT THE WOKE BELIEVE THEY BELIEVED RACE IS FIRST AND FOREMOST THE THING

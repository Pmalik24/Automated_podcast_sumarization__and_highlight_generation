WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAD GUEST SERIES WHERE I AND AN EXPERT GUEST I GUST SCIENCE AN SCIENCE ACE WOINS RNI INI MAN DREW HUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICIN TO DAY'S EPISODE MARKS THE FIRST IN A SERIES WITH DOCTOR ANDY GALPIN DOCTOR ANDY GALPIN IS A PROFESSOR OF CONNESIOLOGY IT CALSTATE UNIVERSITY FULLERTON AND ONE OF THE FOREMOST WORLD EXPERTS ON THE SCIENCE AND APPLICATION OF METHODS TO INCREASE STRENGTH SPEED ENDURANCE HYPERTROPHY AND VARIOUS OTHER ASPECTS OF FITNESS EXERCISE AND SPORTS PERFORMANCE ACROSS THE SIX EPISODE SERIES DOCTOR ANDY GALPAN PULLS FROM HIS EXPERTEES WORKING WITH EVERYTHING FROM PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES TO RECREATIONAL EXERCISERS AND TEACH US US THE MECHANISMS LOGIC AND SPECIFIC PROTOCALLS FOR HOW TO ACHIEVE ANY OF THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT EXERCISE ADAPTATIONS THAT I MENTION A MOMENT AGO RANGING FROM STRENGTH TO ENDURANCE HYPERTROPHY AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN WE GET REALLY FAR INTO DETAILS BUT AT ALL TIMES PAING ATTENTION TO THE MACROSCOPIC ISSUES THAT IS HOW TO CREATE A PROGRAM FOR ENDURANCE OR STRENGTH OR HYPERTROPHY OR SPEED OR ONE THAT COMBINES ALL OF THOSE WE ALSO TALK ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION AND NUTRITION AND HOW TO MAXIMISE RECOVERY FOR EACH OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXERCISE ADAPTATIONS DURING TO DAY'S EPISODE DOCTOR GALPANTEACHES US HOW TO ACCESS OUR LEVEL OF FITNESS AND MORE GENERALLY HOW TO THINK ABOUT FITNESS SO THAT WE CAN BEST ACHIEVE ARE FITNESS EXERCISE AND PERFORMANCE SCHOOLS DOCTOR PROFESSOR ANDY GALPAN SUPEREXCITED TO HAVE YOU HERE THERARE SUCH AN IMMENSE TREASURE SHROVE OF INFORMATION ON PHYSICAL TRAINING AND OPTIMIZING FOR SPECIFIC GOALS AND OUTCOMES WITH PHYSICAL EXERCISE I'M CURIOUS HOWEVER SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF FITNESS SOME PEOPLE ARE PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES OF COURSE BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT MANY PEOPLE EXERCISE REGULARLY SOME PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DO THAT MORE SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING TOO MUCH OF THAT THEIRE OVERTRAINING THEY'RE NOT RECOVERING ENOUGH IF WE WERE TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND EACH AN EVERY ONE OF US ASK HOW FIT ARE WE WITH THE WORD FIT OF COURSE BEING A VERY BROUHD INCOMPASSING WORD COULD COMPASS ENDURANCE CERTAINLY DOES STRENGTH THE ABILITY TO RUN FAST EVEN IF FOR SHORT DISTANCES IT MIGHT EVEN INCLUDE HYPERTROPHY OR DIRECTED HYPERTROPHRY TRYING TO BALANCE ONE'S MUSCULATURE TO OFFSET A CYMETRIES RECOVER FROM INJURIES ET CETERA HOW SHOULD I OR ANYONE ELSE FOR THAT MATTER THINK ABOUT THEIR LEVEL OF FITNESS AND I KNOW MY RESTING HEARTRATE BUT WHAT DO I DO IN TERMS OF REALLY ACSESSING WHETHER OR NOT I'M AS FIT AS I COULD BE AND SHOULD BE BOTH FOR SAKE OF HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE AND HERE I'M ASKING THE QUESTION NOT AS AN ATHLETE BUT AS SOMEBODY WHO AS BEEN PRETTY CONSISTENT AS AN EXERCISER BUT IF WE WERE TO THROW OUR ARMS AROUND THIS QUESTION OF HOW W DO WE ASSESS OUR FITNESS WHAT WOULD BE A FOR THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF A SESTIMENT THAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT AND DO WHEN IT COMES TO EXERCISE PEOPLE GENERALLY HAVE TO MAJOR GOALS IN MIND GOL NUMBER ONE IS ACHIEVING SOME SORT OF APPEARANCE WHY THIS IS I WANT TO BE BIG OR WANT O NOT O BE TOO BIG OR I WANT TO BE LEAN SOMETHING RIGHT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THAT GOAL IS BUT THERE IS AN ESTHETIC COMPONENT ALMOST EVERYBODY THEY WANT TO LOOK A CERTAIN WAY OR NOT LIKE A CERTAINWY THE OTHER ANT IS FUNCTIONALITY SO I WANT O BE ABLE TO PERFORM A CERTAINWY NOW AGAIN THAT DEFINITION DIFFERS FOR PERSONS I WANT I BE BETTER AT STRENGTH I WANT TO BE BETTER AT MOBILITY I WANT TO BE ABLE TO IHAVE ENERGY THROUGHOUT TH WHATEVERIT IS SO THERE'S SOME SORT OF APPEAL TO ASTETIC THERE'E SOME SORT OF APPEAL TO FUNCTIONALITY SO WITH IN BOTH THOSE CATEGORIES WE WANT TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE DO I NEED TO GO WITH MY EXERCISE TRAINING SO THAT I CAN BE AS FIT AND AS HEALTHY AN ACHIEVE THESE GOALS AT I WANT NOW AS WELL AS BE ING A POSITION WHERE I CAN MAINTAIN THEM FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME SO THIS BLENDS BOTH IMMEDIATE GOALS SO SAY YOURE JUST INTERESTED IN SQUATTING A LOT AWAGT SAY YOU'RE INTERESTED IN RUNNING A FIVE CA TIME THE BEST UENT IT DOESN'T MATTER IT BLENDS THAT WITH THE ABILIT THI THE DESIRE TO HAVE A LONG WELLNESS SPAN TO BE FIT THROUGHOUT LIFE TO ACHIEVE ALL THOSE THINGS FOR LONG AS POSSIBLE SO THAT IN THE QUESTION KIND COMES BACK TO SAYING HOW TO I KNOW WHICH ARY I NEED A FOCUS ON THE MOST AND WHY AM I NOT ACHIEVING THESE GUALS OR HOW CAN I GET THERE MORE FACTIVELY AND IF WE LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL MAJOR COMPONENTS THE PHYSICAL FITNESS THAT ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED IN ALL OF THESE CATEGORIES AND TO ACHIEVE THAT THERE ARE HANDFUL OF COMPONENTS A HAFE TO HAPPEN TO BE ABLE TO HIT THOSE GULLS NOW THERE INFINITE METHODS SO THE SAYME WAY ACTUALLY USE HERE LOT IS THE METHODS ARE MANY BUT THE CONCEPTS ER FEW SO WHAT I LOVE TO DO TO DAY IS OVER THE COURSE OF OUR DISCUSSION IS HIT EXACTLY WHAT THOSE CONCEPTS ARE AND THEN COVERAL WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT METHODS AND WE COUL DO THAT FOR HOURS BUT WE'LL COVER A NUMBER OF THEM FOR VARIOUS SGUALS SO ONE OF THE REASONS I WENT INTO NEURO SCIENCE AND NOT INTO EXERCISE SCIENCE ITIS BECAUSE OF THIS THING NAURO PLASTICITY THAT NERVOUS SYSTEMS IBILITY TO ADAPT BUT THE MORE TIME I SPEND WITH YOU AND THE MORE I LEARN FROM YOU I REALIZE THAT MANY IF NOT ALL OF THE ORGAN SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO ADAPT AND WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PHYSICAL EXERCISE THERE ARE INCREDIBLE ADAPTATIONS THAT OF COURSE IN BOLVE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM BUT ALSO IN VOLVE MUSCLE AND CONNECTIVE TISSUE AND SO MANY OTHER SELTYPES AND TISSUES THAT'S SAID WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FITNESS WHAT ARE THE MAJOR TYPES OF ADAPTATIONS THAT UNDERLIE THIS THING THAT WE CALL FITNESS AND LATER I KNOW WE'RE GING TO GET INTO HOW DIFFERENT FORMS OF EXERCISE CAN TRIGGER DIFFERENT TYPES OF ADAPTATIONS BUT WHAT ARE THE MAJOR ADAPTATIONS THAT ONE CAN CREATE IN THEIR BODY USING EXERCISE THERE THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY ONE SHOULD EXERCISE AND WE COULD PERHAPS COVER THAT LATER IN OUR CHATS BUT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ADAPTATIONS CAN BE BUCKETED REALLY IN A NINE AREAS SO THE VERY FIRST ONE IS WHAT I CALL SKILL OR TECHNIQUE SO JUS LEARNING TO MOVE BETTER MORE EFFICIENTLY WUT THE SPECIFIC PECICION AND TIMING AND SEQUEND SIR WHATEVER THAT IS THIS COULD BE RUNNING MORE EFFECTIVELLY THIS COULD BE PRACTING A SKILL LIKE SHOOTING A A BALL OR AN IMPLEMENT SWINGING A GOLF CLUB ANYTHING LIKE THAT I CALL THAT SKILL DEVELOPMENT THE SECOND ONE IS SPEED THIS  SIMPLY MOVING AT A HIGHER VELOCITY OR WITH A BETTER RATE OF ACCELERATION A THAT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE NEXTONE WHICH IS POWER AND POWER IS SPEED MULTIPLIED BY FORCE THE NEXT ONE THEN OF COURSE ON TOP THAT IS FORCE OR STRENGTH IS THAT THOSE ARE REALLY SYNONYMOUS TERMS RIGHT AHOW EFFECTIVELY CAN YOU MOVE SOMETHING NOW THIS IS OFTEN CONFUSED STRENGTH RATHER AS MUSCULAR ENDURANCE SO WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS STRENGTH TRULY IS A MARKER OF HOW WHAT'S THO MAXIMUM THING YOU CAN MOVE OR IT'S SO MAXIMMOUNT OF FORCE YOU CAN PRODUCE ONE TIME ITS NOT HOW MANY REPETITIONS IN A ROW YOU CAN DO THAT'S ACTUALLY ANOTHER ONE OF OUR ADITATIONS CALLED MUSCULAR ENDURANCE I RIGHT SO THAT IS TYPICALLY UNDER THE ORDER OF LIKE SAY FIVE TO TWENTY FIVE MAY BE FIFTY REPETITIONS THINK OF A CLASSIC HOW MANY PUSH UPS CAN YOU DO IN A ROW OW MAY SIT UPS CAN DO IN A MINUTE TAT THINGS LIKE THAT OUR MUSCULAR ENDURANCE MUSCULAR ENDURANCE TENDS TO BE LOCALIZED SO THIS IS YOUR SPECIFIC TO JUST SAY YOUR TRICEPTS IN YOUR AN YOUR DELTOIDS IT'S NOT A OVER ALL CARTY OF ASCULAR ENDURANCE MARKOR OR ANYTING LIKE THAT SO THATS STRENGTH NUMBER FOUR NUMBER FIVE IS MUSCLEHYPERTROPHY AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN APPEARANCE RATHER THAN A FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME SO YOU MOVING BETTER MOVING FAST OR MOVING HEAVIER OR INDICATORS OF HOW WELL YOU CAN MOVE THIS IS THE FIRST ONE THAT O SIMPLY HOW BIG IS YOUR MUSCLE THAT'S MUSCLIN PERCHRIER MUSCLE SIZE AFTER THAT IS MUSCULAR ENDURANCE SO THIS IS HOW MANY REPETITIONS YOU CAN TYPICALLY DO OF A MOVEMENT SO THINK OF HOW MANY PUSH UP SIN A ROW YOU CAN DO HOW MANY ST UPS IN A MINUTE YOU CAN DO THINGS THAT ARTYPICALLY IN LIKE FIVE TO FIFTY REPETITION SORT OF RANGE AND IT IS OFTEN OR IT IS ALMOST ALWAYS LOCAL MUSCLE SO WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS IT IS I I PUSH UP TESSES IS REALLY HOW MANY RAPS THAT YOUR TRYCEPTS AND PACKSAN IN DELTOITS CAN DO IT IS NOT A PARTY OF ASCULAR ENDURANCE IT IS NOT A GLOBAL PHYSIOLOGICAL ENDURANCE IS SPECIFIC TOTYPICALLY ONE OR A FEW MUSCLE GROUPS AT A TIME THIS IS WHY YOU HAVE TO DO MULTIPLE TESTS FOR A SORT OF EVERY GROUP THERE AFTER THAT NOW WE'VE MOVED INTO NUMBER SEVEN WHICH IS WHAT I CALL ANEROBIC CAPACITY THIS IS MORE SYNONYMOUS WITH MAXIMUM HEART RAT AND NOW ERE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT RATHER THAN A SINGLE MOVEMENT OR MUSCLE GROUP IT IS A TOTAL PHYSIOLOGICAL O LIMITATION SO IT IS A THE MAXIM MOUNT OF WORK YOU CAN DO AND SAY THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE SECONDS MAYBE EVEN UP TO A HUNDRED AN TWENTY SECONDS OF ALL OUT WORK I THINK OF YOUR CLASSIC INTERVAL TYPE OF STUFF HERE SO HOW MUCH WORK CAN YOU DO AT A MAXIMUM RATE WHERE YOU CAN ENTER TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF GLOBAL FATIGUE THE NEX PAST THAT IS MAXIMULAROBIC CAPACITY AND THIS IS PROBABLY TY SOMETHING LIKE IN THE EIGHT O FIFTEEN MINUTE RAIN WERE YOU'RE GOING TO REACH PROBABLY BOTH A MAXIMUM HEARTRATE AS WELL AS A TRUE VIO TWO MAX WHICH WILL WILL TALK A LOT MORE ABOUT WHAT THAT IS O LATER SO THAT IS IS A DIFFERENT FROM THE PREVIOUS ONE WHERE YOU CAN'T REACH THIS IN A MATTER OF SECONDTS IT SIMPLY TAKES MULTIPLE MINUTES TO GET TO A POSITION TO WERE YOUR VIEL TWO MAXIS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE A SUFFICIENTLY CHALLENGED ARE INDICATED THE THEN I'LL AST ONE NUMBER NINE IS WHAT A COLONG DURATION AND THIS IS JUST YOURABILITY TO SUSTAIN SOME MAXIMAL WORK FOR A LONG PERIOD TIME WITH NO BREAKS NO REDUCTION WHATSOEVER THIS IS OFTEN CALLED STEADY STATE TRAINING OR LOT OF PEOPLE TO THINK OF THIS WHEN THINK OF WHAT UNCLE CARDIO BUT YOUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE MOVE AND WITHOUT ANY BREAKS OR CHANGE OR DROP  IS THE LAST IN FINAL ADAPTATION AND FOR LONG DISTANT STEADY STATE UM I'M GUESSING IT EXCEEDS FIFTEEN MINUTES BECAUSE A MET A THE PREVIOUS ONE WAS AT EIGHT TO FIFTEEN MINUTES OR SO UM WHAT SORT OF US REAT TIME RANGES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF THIS A LONG DURATION WILL THAT'S LICTUALY ONE IFOR YOU CAN BE ANYTHING PAST FIFTEEN MNUTES SO REALLY IF YOU LOOK AT A A COUNT OF A MINTIMAL NUMBER THERES GENERALLY TWENTY MINUTES OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR BUT A A MORE TYPICAL WOULD BE TWENTY TO SIXTEY MINUTES BUT ANYTHING PASS THI WOULD STILL BE LIMITED BY YOUR LONG DURATION ANDDURANTS SEERABILITYE TO SUSTAIN WORK OVER TIME O CASE YORE IVEN THAT THEREARE NINE DIFFERENT MAJOR ADAPTATIONS THAT CAN BE INDUCED WITH EXERCISE OF SPECIFIC TYPES IS THERE ANY ONE GLOBAL TEST OR SESSIMENT THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE OR DO THAT A LOWS THEM TO DETERMINE WHAT LEVEL OF ABILITY OF FITNESS THEY HAVE IN EACH AN EVERY ONE OF THESE NINE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THERE ARE PROBABLY DOZN OR MORE TESTS THAT YOU CAN DO FOR EACH ONE OF THOSE NINE CATEGORIES AND WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO DO IS WALK YOU THROUGH MY FAVORITES FOR EAT AND GIVING YOU BOTH THE SCIENTIFIC GOLD STANDARDS  IF YOU HAD THE ABILITY I LIMITO RESOURCES WHAT SHOULD YOU GO DO AS WELL AS SOME THATAR ARE EQUIPMENT FREE THAT ARE COST FREE THINGS THAT ANY ONE CAN DO ACROSS THE WORLD IN ADDITION TO THAT I WAT A WALK YOU THROUGH WHAT THOSE NUMBERS SHOULD BE HOW D O IDENTIFY IF YOU REALLY POUR IN SOMETHING OR IF YOUR GREAT AND THEN IF YOU AREN'T AS GOOD MAY BE IN A CATEGORY YOU WANT TO GET BETTER AT IT EXACTLY WHAT TO DO IN TERMS OF PROTOCAULS A FOR HOW I CHIEVOPTIM RESULTS IN EACH OF THOSE SEPS SO I NOTICE IN YOUR LIST OF THE NINE DIFFERENT ADAPTATIONS TO EXERCISE THAT YOU DID NOT MENTION FAT LOSS OR HEALTH PROMOTING BENEFITS WHICH ARE TWO REASONS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE EX ERCISE WAS THERE SPECIFIC REASON THAT YOU DID NOT MENTION THOSE ABSOLUTELY ITS BECAUSE THOSE THINGS ARE ACTUALLY NOT SPECIFIC TRAINING STYLES THEY ARE BY PRODUCTS OF THESE NINE SO WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS IF YOU UNDERSTAND HOW FAT LOSS OCCURS WHICH WE CAN TERNLY TALK ABOUT YOU'LL REALIZE SOME OF THESE NINE PROTOCOLLS ARE EFFECTIVE FOR FAT LOSS OS SOME ARE NOT AGENERAL HEALTH IS THE SAME THING WHEN WE UNDERSTAND WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS TO BE HEALTHY FROM A PHYSIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE THEN THE RATIONOW FOR WHAT TO TRAIN FOR IS GOING TO DETERMINATESELF SO WHAT I MEAN IS LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE IN ORDER TO BE HEALTHY YOU HAVE TO HAVE SUFFICIENT STRENGTH YOU HAVE TO HAVE CARTYOF VASKER FITNESS WYE HAVE TO HAVE SUFFICIENT MUSCLE AND ET CETERA THEREFORE TRAINING FOR ONE'S HEALTH IS DETERMINED BY THOSE RESTRICTIONS SO FOR YOU ANDREW YOU MAY NEED TO DO MORE STRENGTH TRAINING TO BE HEALTHY WHERE ME BECAUSE I'M STRONG ALREADY WAY STRONGER THAN YOU I MAY NOT NEED TO DO AS MY STRENGTH TRAINING SO OUR COTUNCLE HEALTH BASED PROTOCOS ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT STATUS OR LIMITATIONS AND PHYSICAL FITNESS AMONG THESE NINE AREAS SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO TO DAY IS TO COVER A BRIEF HISTORY OF EXERCISE SCIENCE AND THE REASON IS IT'S GOING TO EXPLAIN A WANT ABOUT WHY PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING THE GOALS IN THEIR EXERCISED PROGRAMS THAT THEY WNT AS WELL AS GIVES YOU VERY SPECIFIC DIRECTION ABOUT WHAT TO DO INSTEAD I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR ALL THE THINGS THAT I'M DOING INCORRECTLY AND HAVE YOU HELP ME REMEDY THAT BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE EMPHASIZED AT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS ALSO SEPARATE FROM DOCTOR GALPAN'S TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT CAL STATE FOLLICTON IT IS HOWEVER PART OF OUR DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRINGS EROCOSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SIZED RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME WED LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TODAYS PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS MORMENTUS MOMENTOUS MAKE SUPPLEMENTS OF THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST QUALITY THE HUBERMAN LAB PODCAST IS PROUD TO BE PARTNERING WITH FORMENTUS FOR SEVERAL IMPORTANT REASONS FIRST OF ALL AS I MENTION THEIRE SUPPLEMENTS ARE OF EXTREMELY HIGH QUALITY SECOND OF ALL THEIR SUPPLEMENTS ARE GENERALLY IN SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS IF YOU'RE GOING TO DEVELOP A SUPPLEMENTATION PROTOCALL YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO FOCUS MAINLY ON USING SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS WITH SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS YOU CAN DEVISE THE MOST LOGICAL AND EFFECTIVE AND COST EFFECTIVE SUPPLEMENTATION REGIMENT FOR YOUR GOALS IN ADDITION MOMENTOUS SUPPLEMENT SHIP INTERNATIONALLY AND THIS IS OF COURSE IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE REALIZE THAT MANY OF THE HUBERMAN LAPODCAST LISTENERS RESIDE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IF YOU LIKE TO TRY THE VARIOUS SUPPLEMENTS MENTIOND ON THE HUBERMANLADPODCAST IN PARTICULAR SUPPLEMENTS FOR FORMON HEALTH FOR SLEEP OPPLEMIZATION FOR FOCUS AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS INCLUDING EXERCISE RECOVERY YOU CAN GO TO LIVEMOMENTOUS SPELLED O U EST SO THAT LIVMOMENTOUS DOTCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTUROLIKE DRINK THAT CONTAINS THE EXACT RATIOS OF THE ELECTROLITE SODIUM MAGNESUM AN POTASSIUM TO OPTIMIZ SELLER FUNCTIONING FOR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE MOST PEOPLE REALIZ IS THAT HIDRATION IS KEY WE NEED TO INJEST IN OU FLUIDS IN ORDER TO FEEL OUR BEST AND PERFORM OUR BEST BUT WHAT MOST PEOPLE DO NOT REALIZE IS THAT THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF OUR SELVES AND NERVE CELLS NUROMS IN PARTICULAR REQUIRES THAT SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BE PRESENT IN THE CORRECT RATIOS NOW OF COURSE PEOPLE WITH PREHI PRETENSION AND HIH PERETENSION NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THEIR SODIUMEN TAKE BUT WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS THAT IF YOU DRINK CAFFENE IF YOU EXERCISE ND IN PARTICULAR IF YOUR FALLING OF VERY CLEAN DIET THAT IS NOT A LOT OF PROCESS FOODS WHICH OF COURSE IS A GOOD THING CHANCES ARE YOU'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH SODIUM POTASSIUM AND MAGNESIUM TO OPTIMIZE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE PACKE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT'S ONE GRAM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF PATASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM AND NO SUGAR IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S EL M N T DOK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET A

MAKE SMART MATTRESS COVERS WITH COOLING HEATING AND SLEEP TRACKING CAPACITY I'VE BEN USING AN EIGHT SLEEP MATTRESS COVER FOR ABOUT THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS AND IT HAS COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED MY SLEEP I'M SLEEPING ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT BUT I'M SLEEPING FAR DEEPER AND I'M NOW GETTING THE PROPER RATIOS OF SO CALLED RAPID I MOVENT OR REM SLEEP AND SLOW WAVE SLEEP AND WAKING UP FEELING FAR MORE RECOVERED MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM FOR ALL THAT IS VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD I'VE TALKED MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS POD CAST AND ELSEWHERE ABOUT THE CRITICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SLEEP AND BODY TEMPERATURE THAT IS IN ORDER TO FALL ASLEEP AT NIGHT YOUR BODY NEEDS O DROP BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES IN TERMS OF COOR BODY TEMPERATURE AND WAKING UP INVOLVES A ONE TO THREE DEGREE INCREESE AND CUOR BODY TEMPERATURE WITH EIGHT SLEEP MATTRESS COVERS YOU CAN ADJUST THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT TO BE ONE TEMPERATURE AT THE STAR OF THE NIGHT A DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT AND A DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE AS YOU APPROACH MORNING EACH OF WHICH CAN PLACE YOU INTO THE OPTIMAL STAGES OF SLEEP AND HAVE YOU WAKING OUP FEELING MORE REFRESHED THAN EVER IF YOUD LIKE TO TRY EIGHT SLEEP YOU CAN GO TO EIGHT SLEEP DO CAM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CHECK OUT THEIR POD THREE COVER AND SAVE A HUNDRED A FIFTY DOLLARS AT CHECKOUT EIGHT SLEEP CURRENTLY SHIPS IN THE U SSA CANDADA UNITED KINGDOM SELECT COUNTRIES IN THE EU AND AUSTRALIA AGAIN THAT'S EIGHT SLEEP DOK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO SAVE A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS AT CHECKOUT BEFORE WE GET IN TO HOW THE HISTORY OF EXERCISE SCIENCE IN FORMS THE MISTAKES THAT WE ARE ALL MAKING AND HOW TO REMEDY THOSE MISTAKES I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER NOT YOU HAVE ANY FAVORITE ONE OR TWO STUDIES THAT POINT TO A SORT OF NATURALLY ACCURRING A EXAMPLE OF HOW PEOPLE CAN BECOME VERY FIT IN ONE ARIA AND NOT ANOTHER IN I'M FAMILIAR WITH SEEING ENDURANCE ATHLETES THAT APAPPARENTLY HAVE TERRIFIC ENDURANCE BUT AT LEAST TO MY EYE DON'T LOOK LIKE THEY ARE PARTICULARLY STRONG I'M ALSO FAMILIAR WITH SEEING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE VERY VERY STRONG PTOGLAR N SOCIAL MEDIA BUT THAT DON'T LOOK LIKE THEY COULD WALK UP I LIGHT OF STAIRS MUCH LESS RUN A MILE YOU HAVE ANY EXAMPLES OF STUDIES IN OR OUTSIDE THE LABORATORY THAT POINT TO THAT IN A CONCRETE WAY THERE'S A LOT TO HAP TO DISCUSS HERE BUT I'LL ANSWER REALLY CLEAR AIF YOU LOOK ACROSS THE LITERATURE AN THIS IS ACTUALLY BACK TO AS EARLY AS THE MID NINETEEN FIFTIES IN FACT THAT ACTUALLY GOES BACK TO PREVIOUS TO THAT TO THE HARVARD FATIGLAB NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN TO NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN AREA PEOPLE ACTUALLY WERE ADVOCATING AT THAT POINT A COMBINATION OF STRENGTH TRAINING AN ANDURANCE IN THEN NNTING TWEN WAY BACK THAN E FACT ACTO GOES PRIOR THAT DAY LAY EIGHTEEN EIGHTIES THERE'S SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE BACK THAT IKE BECAME MORE WELL DEVELOPED IN THE MIDNINETEEN FIFTIES AN SIXTIES IN FACT THERE WAS THE INITIAL STAGES OF WHAT'S CALLED THE EXERCISES MEDICINE MOVEMENT WHICH IS THE MOVEMENT NOW BUT THE INITIAL STAGES OF THAT ACTUALLY ROUTE BACK TO THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND I OLD ACTUALY GO ING THAT WHOLE DISCUSSION IN T STORY OF  HOW THAT ALL CAME ABOUT BUT THAT'S THE HEALTH ESS WEALTH A MONTRA THAT CAME FROM THE NINETEEN FIFTIES FROM THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUITY THET ALL THOSE THOSE DATA POINTS ARE GOING TO SUGGEST YOU NEED A COMBINATION OF SOME SORT OF BROAD STRENGTH TRAINING AND BROAD ENDURANCE NOW IF YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC GOAL FIVE MONTHS FROM NOW WE WANT A COMPETE IN A RAS URE H A CERTAIN PHYSIQUE THINK THAT'S FINE TO FOCUS ON ONE AREA TRAINING CERTAINLY YERE AN ATHLEGE THAT'S DIFFERENT BUT IF YOU WANT A MAXIM MISE HEALTH TAND AND OVER ALL FUNCTIONALITY THROUGHOUT TIME AND EAST BE ACCOMBINATION AND ARE REALLY REALLY HIGHLIKE THIS LIKECAN ACTUALY TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF STUDIES THAT I'VE DONE I'M ONE OF WHEM WE ACTUALLY DID IN STOCKHOME SWEDEN SO I DID THIS AT THE CAROLANSK INSTITUTE WHICH YOU PROBABLY ARE AWARE OF M IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE FOUNDING PLACES OF ALL OF EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY A GENERALY IT STARTED THERE IT WAS CALLED SOMETHING DIFFERENT BACK THEN BUT AREALLY OUR ENTIRE FIELD CAME OUT OF STOCKHOME IN THE CARLANS INSTITUTE AND WE WORK WITH THE WHOLE BUNCH OF CROSS COUNTRY SKEERS THAT WE'RE IN THEIR EIGHTIES AND NINETIES AND SO THEY WERE  COMPETITIVE SKEARS THE NINETEEN FORTIES AND FIFTIES AND THEY HAD BEEN SKEMING COMPETITIVELY FOR THAT ENTIRE DURATIONS YOU'RE TALKING FIFTY TO SIXTY CONSECUTIVE YEARS OF COMPETING SE THERES ARE EIGHTY TO NINETY YEAR OLDS LIVING ALONE AND HEALTHY AND WE COMPARED THEM TO A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS A HERE IN AMERICA WHO ARE THE SAME AGE BUT WE'RE NOT EXERCISING AND WHAT WE WANTED TO DO IS TO SAY AN CAN LOOK OUT WHAT OF THESE LIFELONG ENDURANCE INDIVIDUALS WHATE THEY LOOK LIKE WHEN WE BROUGHT THEM IN THE LAB WHICH IS BY THE WAY AMAZING TO DO A VEAL TO MACCEST ON A NINETY TWO YEAR OLD A ESPECIALLY IN LANGUAGE THAT THEY DON'T SPEAK YOU'RE IN A YOU CAN IMAGINE YOU'RE DOING THIS IN THE HOSPITAL RIGHT AND YOU'RE RUNNING PEOPLE THROUGH THIS IS A CYCLING TESK AND SO FOR A VEAL TO MACCESS YOU HAVE A MASK ON YOUR FACE YOU HOOKED UP TO A METABOLIC CARTS WE CAN COLLECT ALL THE GASES THAT ARE COMING AT YOUR MOUTH AND YOURE YOU'RE CHANTING THESE PEOPLE ON AND BASILY EVERY MINUTE THE WORK LOAD GETS HARDER AND HARD AND HARDER UNTILL YOU CAMP COMPLETEID AND WE'RE DOING THIS IN IN A CARTEOLOGY SENTER AND THE CARDYOLOGIST ARE USUALLY WAITING FOR THE HART RATE TO GET LIKE SLIGHTLY ELEVATED THAN THEY STOP THEM CAUSE THERE  EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY SIX YEARS OLD AND NONLY WE NOT STOPPING THEM BUT WE ARE SCREAMING IN THEIR ESIS LACOGOGO AND SWEETES SURIN AI IN ENGLISH RIGHT AND HEN THAT THE TRANSLATER WITH IT DOESN'T TAKE A LOT OF TRANSLATION WHEN SEVEN SCREAMING AT YOUR FACE LIKE GOGOGO  SO WE RAN THEM THROUGH WHOLE MENTOR VIEW TO MAX TAS WE DID THE SAME THING FOR THOSE FOLKS BACK A HERE AR IN AMERICA AND WHAT WAS A INCREDIBLY CLEAR FROM THAT STUDY WAS THE VIEL TO MAX A YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THESE NUMBERS N NESSES WAS CALED RELATIVE SO IN THE RELATIVE TERMS ARE A MIDDL LEADER'S PER KILEGRAM PERMITET AND SO WE STANDARD NUMBER IS ABOUT EIGHTEEN IS  WE CALL THE LINE OF INDEPENDENCE SO IF YOUREVIEL TWO MAX IS BELOW EIGHTEEN MIDDLE LATERS PERCILEGRAMPERMENT IS VERY HARD FOR YOU TO LIVE BY YOURSELF SO YOU'R FITNESS IS SO LOW YOU PROBABLY A OING TO HAVE SOMEBODY LIVING WITH YOU OR YOU'LL NEED TO BE IN SOME SORT OF ASSISTED LIVING HOM SO IF YOU ARE IN LIKE VIEL TWO MAX OF TWENTY YOR TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWO YOU'RE NOT BELOW THAT LINE OF INDEPENDENCE BUT YOU'RE ON THAT THRESHOLD AND SO WE FOUND WAS OUR FOLKS HERE IN AMERICA THE GROUP AVERAGE WAS RIGHT AROUND THAT NUMBER SO THEY WERE LIVING AT HOME BY DEFINITION WE PICK THEM TO BE PEOPLE LIVING BY THEMSELVES IN THEIR EIGHTIES NOT IN T LIVING BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY BAND WITH SO IF THEY GOT A COLD OR THEY HAD ANYTHING POP UP WHERE THEY LOST A LITTLE BIT OF FITNESS THEY WERE A DROP BELOW THAT LINE AND WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO GO TO SOME SERTICE AS O LIVING SITUATION THE FOLKS IN STOCKHOM THE THE CROSS COUNTRY SKEERS THE GROUP AVERAGE WAS MOST CLOSER LIKE THIRTY FIVE TO THIRTY EIGHT MILL LADERSPIKILEGRAM PERMITTED NOW THAT NUMBER IS ABOUT THE VIEL TWO MAX YOU WOULD FIND FOR A NORMAL COLLEGE MAIL AND SO THESE FOLKS THAT WERE LITERALLY EIGHTY OR NINETY IF THE NOF THE JOKE IF A SABER TWO TIGER RAN IN THE ROOM OR R WHATEVER AN IT CHASE IT DOWN AND WE ALL HAD TO RUN TO SEE WHO DIDN'TGET EATEN ALIVE THAT THE COLLEGE MEN WOULD PROBABLY'VE GOT N EATEN BEFORE THE THE NINETY YEAR OLDS IN IN ONE CASE WE HAD A NINETY TWO YEAR OLD INDIVIDUAL DI THINK HIS VIEL TO MAX WAS THIRTY EIGHT WHICH WAS AN OUR ESTIMATION WOROLD RECORD THE HIGHEST FIEL TO MAX FOR SOMEBODE OVER THE AGE OF NINETY ME ASK WHAT IS THE TYPICAL RESTING HEART RATE FOR SOMEBODY A VERY FIT LIKE THESE UM A OLDER SWEEDISH CROSS COUNTRY SKEARS THEYYOU'VE SOMEBODY HAS A AM THIS LET SAY THEIR NUMBER IS THIRTY FIVE MILLIERS FOR KILEGRAM IN THIS A VIEL TWO MAX TEST BUT SINCE MOST OF MUST DON'T HAVE ACCESS YET THAT KIND OF EQUIPMENT BUT THE WE CAN'T MEASURE OUR PULSRATE YE  WHAT WAS A TYPICAL RESTING HEARTRATE RESTING PULSORY SUB SIXTY SYE IM  TYPICALLY THAT'S A GOOD NUMBER TO GO OFF FOR ANYBODY REGARDLESS OF AGE ANY TIME I SEE SOMEBODY ABOVE THAT O I'M CONSTERN'T ASKING QUESTIONS SCERTAINLY ABOVE NOW YOU'L SEEIN THE LITERATURE PEOPLE WILL SAY SIXTY TO EIGHTY IS NORMAL ON I I DON'T AGEE THOAT AT ALL IF YOU'RE UP IF YOU'R RESTING HARTRID IS SEVENTY FIVE BEAUST FOR MENAT THERE'S EITHER SOMETHING GOING ON OR YOU'RE NOT FIT HOW MUCH CROSS COUNTRY SCHEME WERE THEY DOING ON AVERAGE IN THE PREVIOUS MULT SAY IF WE TAKE THE PREVIOUS TWENTY YEARS SINCE THEY'D BEEN LONG COME CROSS COUNTRY SCEARS DIVIDE THAT BY TWENTY YEARS YET ON EVERAGAR OF THESE PEOPLE CROSS COUNTRY SCHEME FIVE HOURS A AY TWO HOURS DAY AN HOUR OR DE YET THAT'S ACTUALLY GOD QUESTION I DON'T REMEMBER IT'S BEEN MANY YEARS I BUT THEY WERE NOT DOING IT EVERY SINGLE DAY AND THE VOLUME WOULD NOT OF SHOCKED YOU IT WAS THE CONSISTENCY OVER FIFTY YEARS THA GOT THEM THERE NOW IB SEE THESE PEOPLE WERE AGAIN WORLD CHAMPIONS AND LUMPIC OLD METALIS IND NINETEEN FORTIES AND FIFTIES SO THEY WERE YE LEAT THEY JUST CONTINUED CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME BUT IT WASN'T A SHOCKING AMOUNT OF PHYSICAL FITNESS THEY ALSO DIDN'T GODY THEIR WAY TO TRAIN HARD THEY WERE BUSY CHOPPING WOULD THEY WERE BUSY DOING NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS AND THEN THEY JUST HAPPENED TO DO SOME OFTHESE RACES AND SKI A LONG WAY BUT IT WASN'T A CRAZY AMOUNT TO WHERE YOU'R LIKE ALL THAT'S GREAT BUT I CAN NEVER HIT THAT NUMBER YIT WAS SOMETHING MUCH MORE REASONABLE SO IS THE TAKE AWAY TO BE CONSISTENT ABOUT GETTING CARTY ASCULAR EXERCISE AND WE CAN DEFINE YET WHAT CONSISTENT MEANS IN TERMS OF DAYS PER WEEK LO BIT LATER I KNOW WE WILL WHAT ER SOME OTHER EXAMPLES I LOVE THESE EXAMPLES OF A FROM THE REAL WORLD SO HERE HERE'S THE DOWNSIDE THOUGH SO I ONLY TOLD YOU ABOUT THEIR VIAL TO MACS WHAT I DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT IS THER LIKE STRENGTH AND FUNCTIONALITY AND THAT PART WAS NO MORE SUPERIOR THAN IT WAS THEI'R COUNTER PARTS WHO WERE NOT EXERCISERS SO WHAT THAT SHOWED REALLY REALLY CLEARLY AND MANY OTHER STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE SINCE THEN THAT LOOK AT THE CLASS IT AL WE CALL LIFE LONG ENDURANCE EXERCISERS YOU WILL SEE IN GENERAL THEI'R VEAL TO MACTS THER CARTY OF ASCER FUNCTION THEY'RE RESTING HART RATE THEY'RE BLOOD PRESSURE IT WILL BE A MARKEDLY HEALTHIER THEN FOLKS YO DON'T EXERCISE IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY CLEAR THAT TYPE OF EXERCISE IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR CHRONICTO TESE MANAGEMENT NO DOUT ABOUT IT HOWEVER IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR OVER ALL GLOBL HEALTH BECAUSE IT DOES ALMOST NOTHING FOR LEGS STRENGTH FOR ANY OTHER MARKER OF HEALTH WHICH WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE THINGS INER ACTUR GOING TO PREDICT MARTALITY IM OR BEBITYE THE MOST SO THAT WAS A A BIG A BIG SMASHING INDICATION THAT'S A CAYE THIS IS GREAT HOWEVER YOU'RE LEAVING THINGS ON THE TABLE FOR YOU'R OVER ALL HEALTH NOT ONE COULD ARGUE THEY'RE EIGHTY AND TATHEY'RE DOING PRETTY WELL BUT THEY WEREN'T DOING AS WELL IN THESE AREAS AND SO A STUDY WE DID LATER ACTUALLY AS O FOLLOW UP WAS LOOKING AT MONOSLIKE US TWENTS SO THIS IS ACTALLY INTERESTING BEING HE SCIENTISTS HIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF ONE OF MY GRADUAL STUDENTS WHO'D BEEN I MY LAB FOR PROBABLY THREE OR FOUR YEARS AND SHE WAS IN OUR SINGLE FIBRE PHYSIOLOGY LAB AND SHES YOU IMAGINE SHE'S N SHE'S ISOLATING INDIVIDUAL MUSCLE FIBERS FROM AN ATHLETE  ONE BY ONE WITH THE TWEEZER AND SHE'S GOING TO DO SEVERAL THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL CELLS I SAY SHE'S YOU'RE DOWN THERE FOR HOURS AND AN THINGS HAPPENED OWN THERE YOU CANN'T LOSE YOUR MIND AAND CHOOSE KIND OF GOING ON ONE DAY WITH ONE OF MY COLLEGUES  JUST TALKING AND SHES LIKE O YA MY UNCLE IS REALY REALLY FIT AND SOMETHING OR OTHER AND THEN OH YET HE'S A TWIN ANDIS LIKE OS YE MONOSIGAS SIND SHE'S LIKE YET FOR THOSE THAT ARE NO MNASGS IR IDENTICAL TWIN YET WHAT'S IS INTERESTING SO YOU BASELY HAVE WHEN I'M SETTING UP HEREAS IS THIS THE PERFECT EXERCISE SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT MONO'S LIKEUS IDENTICAL TWIN TO MEAN THE THEY HAVE EXACT SAME TOANE SO AN EGG WAS FERTILIZE SPLIT AND THEN TWO HUMANS THREWG OUT OF THAT WITH THE EXACT SAME DEANE AND SO NOW WE CAN STER N ANCE OR THE QUESTIONAWHLE YEKEE WHAT ABOUT MAYBE THESE CROSS COUNTRY SKEEERS MAYBE THEY WERE JUST GUNETIC FREEKS MAYBE IT DIDN'T MATTER ITS LIKE SOME PEOPLE HAVE WU JEN EXERE ALWAYS A COPONENT TO IT BUT HOW MUCH WELL NOW WE HAVE A SANAREA LINING OUP WHERDS SI UIDAMA YOU HAVE MONOS LIKE US TWIN SO WE AVE A REPLICA OF A HUMAN BEING EXACT SAME DEAN E THE ONLY DIFFERENCEIS WE WOULD SEE IN THEIR PHYSIOLOGY NOW WOULD BE DUE TO LIFE SAL CIRCUMSTANCES INTERESTING SO MONOS LIKE US TWAN UN A IT DOUT AN UNCLE RIGHT UNH GREAT DO THEY EXERCISE WE ONE OF EM DOES HE'S THE LIFE LONG ENDURANCE EXERCISE RUNNER PSYCLIST SWIMMER IRON MAN ALL THESE THINGS WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER ONE NO HE DOESN'T EXERCISE AT ALL AT AT THAT POINT LIKE I WANTED TO KILL MY GRADUATE SUDENT CAUSE I'M LIKE YOU'VE BEEN IN MY LAB FOR THREE YEARS OR MORE PROBABLY AND YOU'VE NEVER TOLD ME THAT IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD IS THE PERFECT SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT FOR EXRCISE YOU COULD EVER CREATE I LIKE TES IS THE THE THE LOOK ON HER FACE WHEN MY CALLING AN I WES STARING ATO SUCYCHALL MY GOD SO I'M LIKE CALL THEM RIGHT NOW THEYRE COMING IN THE LAB OF FLY THEM IN FROM CHICAGO OUTONT CARE WHAT WE HAVE TO DO LIKE WE'RE GETTIN IM IN AND SO I WANTED TO ACTUALLY GOING BACK TO THE MODEL THAT WAS FIRST DEVELOPED BY THE HARBOR FATIGLAD ONE THING THAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THAT COMMITTEEIS THEY STARTED OFF WITH THE CONSCTEPT OF TRYING TO EXAMINE HUMAN PER FORMANCE THROUGH A WHOLISTIC LENS AND SO IT WAS THE ANTITHESIS OF LOOKING AT A EITHER ORGAN BY ORGAN SO WE'RE GOING TO ONLY LOOK OUT THE CARTY OFVESCER SYSTEM OR ONLY GOING TO LOOK OUT SKELEN O MUSCLE AND THEN WE'RE SAING WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS ENTIRE PICTURE AND SO THAT MODEL WE WANTED TO CARRY THROUGH WHEN THESE TWINS AN I TAIT ARE RIGHT IM WANT TO BRING THEM IN THE LAB BUT I'M NOT JUST GOING TO LOOK OUT ONE SYSTEM I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING SO WE TOOK STOOL SAMPLES WE TOOK BLOOD WE DID VERTICAL JUMP TEST WE DID MAXIMUM STRENGTH TEST WE DID A AM ORISE OF MUSCLE MASS WE DID I A VEAL TO MAX TEST WE DI DEFICIENCIES OF WE WE DEJNEC TESTANG WE DANICUE TEST WED PSYCHOLOGICAL BATTERY WE WANT TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING TO FIGURE OUT ALL THESE THINGS WHALD DIFFERE BETWEEN THE TWINS AND IF SO THE SECOND KEE QUESTION THERE IS BY HOW MUCH SO CAN I IMPROVE MY VEAL TO MAC SURE EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT BUT HOW MUCH CAN' IT CHANGE BY FIVE PERCENT EIGHTY PER CENT LIKE WHERE IS THE NUMBER AND SO PUTTING SOME QUATIFICATION ON THIS WAS VERY IMPORTANT AND SO AGAIN WE HAD ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A CLASSIC ENDURANCE ONLY TRAINING PARADIME COMPARED TO A A NON CSO THIS IS A A PERSON WIS ENAS A TRUCK DRIVER BY VOCATION WHICH IS I THIN GACTUALLE DROVE FOR A POTATOSHIP COMPANY WHICH WAS EVEN FUNNIER THE THE ENDURANCE ACTLLY ACTUALLY WAS GRAT BECAUSE LIKE ANY ENDURANCE PEOPLE HE HAD A HE HAD PHYSICAL BOOKS OF ALL HIS TRAINING MALEGE FOR THE LAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS AND WE COULD WE WAS WENT THROUGH THEM WE CALCULATED THE TOTAL AMOUNT O MILES HE RAN HIS AVERAGES HIS HART RACE PER E TIME WE HAD THIS UNBELIEVABLE THING LIKE WHAT RACES HE WAS IN AT THE DOCUMENTATION OU WAS IS TOTALLY NOTSTRIGHT LIKE SOMETHING THAT INDURANCE PEOPLE ARE LIKE SHAKIN THEIR HEAD RIGHT OUT GON O YE I GOT THAT TO ANANDURANC SPOKES ARE PRETTY NURRTY YES Y RIGHT SO AS GREAT BECAUSE OW I COULD VALIDY IT AS CLOSE AS ONE COULD TO ACTUALLY HOW MUCH HE RAN ANTHINGS LIKE THAT SO THEY AD ABOUT A THIRTY FIVE YEAR DISCORD THEY BOTH EXERCISED UP THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL ABOUT EIGHTEEN THEY STOPPED DOING IT BY THE TIME TE RUN IN THE LAVTHER IN THEIR MID FIFTY SO IS ABOUT THIRTY FIVE YEARS AT DIFERENCE AND WHEN WE RAN THEM THROUGH THE TESTING IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE  MEASURES THAT WERE SIMILAR TO THE SWEDEN STUDY IT WAS ALMOST IDENTICAL THE EVTHE EXERCISEING TWIN WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER AT THINGS LIKE A LIPID PANEL RESTING HARTRIGHT BLOOD PRESSURE REVEAL TO MAGS ANY OF THOSE MARKERS I ASK PREDICTED WERE ER MUCH BETTER WHAT WAS VERY INTERESTING THOUGH WAS THE THINGS THAT WERE IN THE MIDDLE FIRST OF ALL THEIR TOTAL MONT A MUSCLE MASS WAS ALMOST IDENTICAL LIKE TO THE GRAM WITH IN THE MARGIN OF AIR OF A DEXO SCAMP COULD POSSIBLY EVER BE THE NON EXERCISEER THOUGH WAS A LITTLE BIT FATTER SO THE DIFFERENCE IN ACTUAL BODY WEIGHT WAS EXPLAINED ALMOST ENTIRELY BY BODY FAT AR NON LEAN TISSUE REALLY SAME SURDO SO OKAN LIKE NO ONE SURPRISED THERE THAT THE EXERCISOR WAS A LITTLE BIT LEANER EVEN KNOU IT DIDN'T CHANGE TOLEAMOUN A MUSCLE MASS AT ALL WHEN WE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE MORE FUNCTIONAL TESTS ND WE LOOKED AT THINGS LIKE MUSCLE QUALITY SO THIS IS AMETRIC YOU CAN GET FROM AN ULTRA SOUND YOUDN KIND OF THINK ABOUT THIS AS HOW MUCH FAT IS INSIDE THE TISSUE WHICH IS SOME TIMES IN ADVANTAGE FOR ENDURAN SACTLY TO HAVE A LITTLE BUT MOREFIN WHAT ARE CALED INTURE MUSCLAR TRIE CLA SORISE BECAUSE IT'S A FUEL DIRECTLY NG THE TISSUE BUT IN GENERAL THE EXERCISE ARE THE A THE MUSCLE QUALITY WAS NOT IN FAVOR OF THE EXERCISER IF YOU LOOKED AT THE PERFORMANCE TESTING AND IF YOU LOOKED AT STRENGTH IT FAVORED THEM THE NON EXERCISER SO NOW AGAIN WE HAVE THE SAME FINDING WE SAW IN OUR SWEDEN STUDY BUT IN IDENTICAL TWINS AND SO IT REALLY REALLY TIGH LIGHTED THE FACT THAT IF YOU WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH OPTIMO HEALTH SIMPLY PICKING ONE SI LO IS NOT GOING TO GET YUE THERE WHAT'S ALL TE MEATING JUST RUNNING JUST LIKEING RIGHT DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE TWIN THAT DID NOT EXERCISE COULD JUMP HIRE OR WIN IN ARM RESLIN A COMPETITION NOT THAT THAT'S A VITAL THING TO BE ABLE TO DO WICH JUST IN TERMS OF MEASURING STRENGTH YOU KNOW AS OUR ICOMETRIC STRENGTH AWAS THE NOT EXERCISING TWIN STRONGER O AT LEAST AS STRONG AS THEIR EXERCISE IN YES PERTICULARY INGRIP STRENGTH YET AND ANY THE MEASURES LIKE THE VERTICAL JUMP LIKE EXTENSION POWER IN A NUMBER OF THINGS THEY OFTEN FAVORED THE NON EXERCISER WHICH YOU'RE STILL A LITTLE BIT OF A CHICKEN AND EG YOU DON'T KNOW OF NECESSARILY THE ENDURANCE TRAINING REDUCED THAT OTHER TWINS STRANGTH OR IT DOESN'T EVEN REALLY MATTER PER SAY I THINK THE HIGHLIGHT OF IT IS CAN YOU CHANGE SOME OF THESE METRICS OF VAL TO MAXIA NOT EVEN CLOSE THESE THINGS ARE V ARY RESPONSEIV REGARDLESS OF YOURE GENETIC YOU'R GENETICS WILL GIVE YOU A STARTING PLACE VERY CLEARLY MEVEN THE NON EXERCISEER WAS A PRETTY HEALTHY GOT  THEY WERE'TO GODSPOT ADMID FIFTIES DOESN'T EXERCISE DOESN'T REALPAY ATTENTION IS DIED AT ALL AND HE WAS IN PREGA SHAT HOWEVER IF YOU WANT TO ACTUALLY MOVE PROGRESS AND MOVE FORD A HIGH FUNCTIONALITY YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING BESIDES JUST RUN RIGT JUST DISTANCE RUN NOW I COULD SAY THE SAMETHING FOR STRENGTRING THAT ALONE AX I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THE SING LIKE I'M SAYING UNDERENCS EXERCISES IT WORKED AN BOTH CASE BOTH THY STUDIES THOSE FOLKS WERE MUCH BETTER OFF IN MACTRICS THAT ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO MORTALITY HOW LONG YOU'REGOING TO LIVE VEAL TWO MACS T CETR IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO GET THERE INTERS A STRANK WE TOOK A LOOK AT MUSCLE FIBRE PHYSIOLOGY IS WELL WHICH IS VERY INTERESTING SO WHAT I MEAN IS THERE'S GENERALLY TWO TYPES OF MUSCLE FIBRES FAST TWITCH AN SLOW TWITCH AND ONE ON THINGS IT IS A HALL MARK OF AGANE IS A RESELECTIVE REDUCTION IN FAST WITCH FIBRES AND THT'S BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT TO ACTIVATE THEM UNLES YOU'RE OING HIGE ORSE ACTIVITIES YOU'RE ANT ACTOVE ET SLOW TWITCH FIBRES DOING ALMOST ANY ACTIVITY OF DAILY LIVING AND SO THEY STAY AROUND FAST WICH FIBRES UNLESS YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING OF HIG FORCE OR GOING NOT BE USED AN  NOT GOING TO BE KEPT AROUND AND THAT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS LIKE THE NEED FOR LIKE STRENGTH THROUGHAGING THE ABILITY TO CATCH YOURSELF FROM A FALL THESE THINGS ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANIF YOU DON'T HAVE FASTAT FIBRES YOU DON'T HAVE THE SPEED TO GET YOUR FOOT OUT IN FRONT OF YOU ON TIME AND YOU DO'THAVE THE ECENTRIC STRENGTH THE STOP THE FALL FROM HAPPENING AND SO IF YOU LOOK ACROSSING IN THE AGING LITERATURE THAT THEY'RE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING STRANGTH AN AND FAST WITH FIBRS OVERTIME SO WE KOW THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION HERE OF ROLL AND PEOPLE WILL OFTEN TALK ABOUT O K HOW MUCH OF THAT AIS GENETICALLY DETERMINE CAN I CHANGE MY FIBR TYPE AND THE ANSWER THEIRS IS RESOUNDINGLY YES AND CAN I CHANGE IT WITH EXERCISE AN THE ANSWERS ABSOLUTELY YOU CAN AND THE NEXT QUESTION IS HOW MUCH SO NOW AGAIN RGANISSEEM ORDER OF MAGNITUDE IN GENERAL WITHOUT GOING TOO FAR DOWN A AN AREA MAYBE BEGAY FOR FOR LATER EACH ONE OF YOUR MUSCLES IN YOUR BODY HAS A DIFFERENT PERCENTAGE A FAST WITCH AN SLO TWITCH FOR EXAMPLE YOURE CALF IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR SOLIEST WHICH IS A KIND OF HE SMALLER ONE ECHOES IN THE BACK THAT'S GENERALLY MOSTLY SLOW TWITCH TYPICALLY EIGHTY PER CENT OR SO SLOW TWITCH THE GASTROCH WHICH IS THE OTHER ONE RIGHT NEXT TOITS IF YOU'RE TO POINT YOUR TOE NEXT YOUR FACE IN THAT PART THAT COT A FLUX IS OUT IN THE MIDDLE POPS OUT THAT'S YOUR GASTROCK THAT IS ALMOST THE INVERS SO IT'S GENERALLY EIGHTY PER CENT FAST WITCH MAY BE TWENTY PER SOME SLO TWITCH MGENERALLY ANYTHING ANTI POSTURAL OR POSTURAL RATHER ANTI GRAVITY A SPINAL ERECTORS THINGS HAT AR MET TO KEEP YOU UP OR MOVING ALL DAY ARE GONG TO BE SLOW TWITCH AND THINGS LIKE YOUR HAND STRINGS WHICH PREFER EXPLOSION ARY AND BE FAST WITCH WE BUY UPSO THE CUAD IN THESE INDIVIDUALS AND IN THAT MUSCLE IT'S GENERALLY ABOUT FIFTY FIFTY FAST WITCH SLOWKDWITCH AS IT IS A REALLY BROAD NUMBER WELL WHAT OTHER THINGS T WE FOUND WAS IN THE NON EXERCISER IT WAS ALMOST TAX BOOK WHAT YOU OULD PREDICT IT WAS ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT OR SO SLOW TWITCH A LITTLE BIT OF PERCENTAGE OF FAST WITCH AN A ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT OF ONE OF THESE CALLED HIBRID FIBERS WHICH ARE A HALL MARK OF ACTIVITY IR GREGT IN THE EXERCISER IT WAS ABOUT NINETY FIVE PER CENTS SLOTWITCH AND SO IT'S EXTREMELY CLEAR AGAIN I DON'T KNOW IF MAY BE THEIR SET POINT WAS LOWED HIRER TOWARDS THAT IN THE NON EXERCISER DO YOU KNOW DEVOLVE DOWN TO HIS PLACE OR THEY HE ONE BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER I MEAN GOING FROM FORTY PER CENT SO T WHICH IN ONE CASE TO NINETY FIVE PERCENT SOLITRITCH IN ANOTHER CASE IT SHOWS YOU THAT THE THE LIMITS OF PHYSIOLOGICAL ADAPTATION OUR DARN NEAR BOUNDLESS GIVEN ENOUGH EXPOSURE AN THIS CASE THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF EXTREMELY CONSISTENT TRAINING AND HIS MUSCLE MORPHOLOGY WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN HIS IDENTICAL TWIN OF THE EXACT SAME DAINA THOSE ARE TWO BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE DOING ENDURANCE WORK FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WHAT THAT GIVES THEM IN TERMS OF BENEFITS AND FUNCTIONALITY AS THE OPPOSITE EXPERIMENT BEEN DONE OR OBSERVED WHERE SOMEBODY JUST WEIGHT LIFTED OR JUST SPRINTED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS I I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S A IDENTICAL TWIN A CONTROL THAT NO I WISH BETTA THIRD T AN TO TOO MUCH TAS O RIGHT TRIPLETS O CASE O TRIPLETS OUT THERE OM E FOU'RE EXERCISING IN DIFFERENT WAYS WERE PEOPLE HAVE TRIPLETS MAYBE YOU ASSIGND ONE KID TO BE A RUNNER WHEN IV YE A WEIGHT LIFTER AND THE OTHER ONE TO BE SEDINTARY PLEASE DON'T DO EXPERIMENTS LIKE THAT BUT THE EXPECTATION AS I UNDERSTAND IT WOULD BE THAT THE PERSON THAT SPRINCE OERE TO THAT DOES HEAVY SQUATS EXPLOSIVE WORK WOULD THEN HAVE MORE FAST WITCH MUSCLE FIBRES IN THEIR QUAD AND THEY'RE NON EXERCISING COUNTERPART WU'LD HAVE FEWER THAT THAT WOULD MAKE CENS BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU ASCISE THE THE ENDURANCE LAVEL IN SOMEBODY WHO'S JUST DONE STRING TRAINING OR JUST SPRINTED YET SO WE DON'T HAVE THOSE DATA SPECIFICALLY THERE'S WORD ACTUALLY JUST STARTING TO HAVE STUDIES COME OUT ON LIFE LONG STRENGTH TRANNERS AND THERE'S LITERY VERY GOOD REASON FOR THIS I WHICH IS A WHOLE STORY WE CAN GET INTO BUT THE THE QUICK ANSWER IS WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN LIFTING WAITS FOR THIRTY R PLUS YERS WE HAVE A WHOLE SWATH OF PEOPLE WHOAVE BEEN DOING IN DURNS TRAINING FOR THAT LONG IS THAT BECAUSE FEWER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WEIG TRAINING OR THE WEI TRAINERS ALL DEAD YOU GOUT GO BACK TO THE NINETEEN FIFTY THREE NINETEN FIFTY FOR YET TWO MAJOR THINGS HAPPEN THE CHANGE THE ENTIRE COURSE OF EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY AND EXRCISESCIENCE AND REALLY EXERCISES WE KNOW IT IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY OF OUR FEEL A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS I GET ARE BASED ON FALSE ASSUMPTIONS OF WHAT EXERCISE CAN AND CAN'T DO AS AN EXAMPLE WE A QUESTIONS LIKE MOMENTOM SHOULD I USE MOMENTA AR THAT'S CHEATING RIGHT OR IT DOESN'T WORK I IT COMPROMISES MY RESULTS IT'S ACTUALLY TOTALY UNTRUE THERE ARE EXCELLENT REASONS WHEN YOU SHOULD USE MOMENTO WHEN YOU LEFT THERE ARE REASONS WHEN YOU SHOULD NOT IT IS SOMETIMES VERY BENEFICIAL TO GO FAST WITH THE EXERCISED REPETITION SOMETIMES VERY SLOW AN PATROL THIS BETTER ANY QUESTION I GET IN FACT I'M VERY INFAMOUS FOR ALWAYS RESPONDING WITH IT DEPENDS THE REASON I SAY IT DEPENDS IS IT DEPENDS ON THE GOALD WHEN YOU'RE TRAINING FOR SPEED OR POWER MUSCLAR ENDURANCE THE ANSWER TO SOME OF THESE VERY COMMON QUESTION DIFFERS WHAT PEOPLE FAIL TO REALIZE IS THEY THINK THEY'RE ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTION BECAUSE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS HISTORY WHAT'S BEEN PLANTED IN YOUR BRAIN SUBCONSCIOUSLY IS DRIVING THAT QUESTION IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE RIGHT ONE SO IF WE WALK THROUGH THAT A LITTLE BIT YOU'LL SEE WHAT THAT FIELD HAS LED YOU WHY YOU THINK CERTAIN THINGS MATTER WHEN THEY ACTUALLY DON'T OR MAYBE YOUR ASSUMPTIONS ARENIN CORRECT AND THEN EXACTLY WHAT TO DO ABOUT THEM I LIKE TO SEE A BRIEF BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE OUR SPONSOR ATHLETIC GREENS ITH LETIC GREENS IS A VITEMIN MINERAL PROBIOTIC AND ADAPTEG IN DRINK DESIN TO HELP YOU MEET ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATION OR NUTRICIONAL NEEDS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETI GREENS DAILY SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SO I'M DELIGHTED THAT THEIR RESPONSOR OF THIS PODCAST REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE OUTHLETIC GREENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT IT HELPS ME MEET ALL O MY FOUNDATION OR NUTRICIONAL NEEDS THAT IS IT COVERS MY VITEMENS MY MINERALS AND THE PROBIOTICS ARE ASPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO ME ITH LETIC REENS ALSO CONTAINS ADAPTOGINS WHICH ARE CRITICAL FOR RECOVERING FROM STRESS FROM EXERCISE FROM WORK OR JUST GENERAL LIFE IF YOU LIKE TO TRY IT LETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO TLETI GREENSTOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'L GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL BACKS AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU YEAR SUPPLY OF VITHIM IN DEE THREE CAY TO AGAIN IF YOU LIKE TO TRY IT LETIC GRENS GO TO THLETIC GREENSTOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER SO IN NINETEEN FIFTY THREE NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR YOU HAD ROGER BANISTER BREAKING THE FOUR MINUTE MILE SO SUBTORMENT FILE AND THEY ALSO HAD SIR EDMAN HILERY AND AN HIS TRIP AN NORGAY A SUMMON EVERIST IN THE SAME BISCA TO YOUR SPAND THAT EXACT SAME YEAR AFTER THAT WAS A FORMATION OF WHAT'S CALLED THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SPORTS MEDICINE NOW THAT IS STILL AROUND TO DAY IT IS THE PRE EMINENT GROUP FOR THIS EXERCISES MEDICINE SO IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THINGS LIKE EXERCISE FOR OBISITY PREVENTION FOR CANCER TREATMEN FOR FOR THINGS LIKE THAT IS NOT REALLY SPORTS MEDICINE IT'S MORE FOR A CLINICAL EXERCISE THAT'S THE PLACE TO GO MERICACOLEGE SPORSE MEDICIN SO WE HAVE THIS LAUNCHING OF BOTH A TON OF PEOPLE WANTING TO START DOING ENDURANCE EXERCISES START SWIMMING AND CYCLING AND RUNNING THND YOU HAVE A LAUNCH OF PEOPLE COMING OFF OF THE BACK OF THE HARBOR FATIGUE LAB SO THE FATIGUE LAB ACTUALLY SHUT DOWN ON NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN SO YOU HAVE THESE PEOPLE INTERESTED IN PHYSICAL FITNESS BUT NOWHERE TO GO WELL ALL THOSE PEOPLE LEFT THE HARVERTEAGLAPAN START OF THEIR OWN LABS ANOTHER PLACES SO YOU'VE LAUNCH THE CAREERS OF PEOPLE LIKE A THEY'VE COSTUL AND N AN JOHNHALASE AN SOMEOF THESE VERY FAMOUS EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGISTS AND THEY START BILL ING LABORATORIES AND WE START FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER STUDYING THI SCIENCE OF EXORCISE SO YEARS GO BY AND THESE PEOPLE HAPPEN NINETEEN SIXYS AND NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHEN WE CALL THE RUNNERS BONE SO PEOPLE START THAT IF YOU FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING MARITHONS IT EXPLODS THROUGH THESE TWO DECKATES SPANCE RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S IMPLIKE THEM WE CULD DO THESE EN DURANCE FEAS NOTICE BOTH THOSE FEATS WOR ENDURANCE RIGHT RUNNING SHORT TERM AS WELL AS GOING OVER THERE NO ONE HAS THOUGHT ANYTHING ABOUT STRENGTH TRAINING AND HERE'S WHY IN THE LATE EIGHTEEN EIGHTIES THERE WAS A VERY FAMOUS A PHYSICION AND A GEORGE WINSHIP I THINK WAS HIS NAN WHO'S A BIG PROPONET IV STRENGTH TRAINING WELL HE DIED LKE IN THE AGE OF FIFTY SOMETHING OF A HARDITTACK AND THAT TERRIFIED PEOPLE OF STRENGTH TRAINING FOR SEVENTY YEARS BECAUE THEYRE LIKE WOOO THATS SUFF WE'LL KILL YOU AS HE WAS A DOCTOR HE WAS CRYING HIS RUNNING AROUND THE COUNTRY DOING THISE EXHIBITIONS AND PROPORTING IT AND THEN HE DIED THI SORT LIKE ATGINS HUNDRER PER CENT DYING ALL THE SOME PEOPLE SAID HE DIED OF A HARDER TAK OF THE PEOPLE SAID HE FELL THROUGH THE ICE INTO COLD WATER TIT'S DEBATED BUT THE FACT THAT A E HEVERY PROPONENT IV THE  A NUW TIRCIAN PLAN DIES SUDDENLY YET NOT GOOD FOR BUSINESS SO NOW THE LITTLE STORM IS BREWING NINETEEN FORTIES AND I'M GOING BACK A LITTLE BIT BUT BEAR WITH ME FOR A SECON THERE'S A GUY NAME A PETER CARBRVITGE AND HE'S AA A SCIENTISTS OUT OF SPRINGFILD LIKE THE DECORATED PHYSICAL EDUCATION P THAT GHAT'S A LEGENARY PLACE SPRINGBOOK COLLEGE AND HE IS ANTI STRENGTH TRAING FOR A LOT OF SAME REASONS AND ISN'T OUR CAREER TALKED ABOUT NOTE DO THIS HE'S ONE THAT LOUNCH THESE IDEAS HAT STRENGTH TRAINING WILL MAKE YOU THOSE FLEXIBILITY IT WILL BE BAD FOR KIDS LIKE ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE KNOW NOW ARE CLEARLY NOT TRUE HE'S PROPONER O THESE THINGS AND THERE'S A SHOW THAT HAPPENED I'MIN HIS A SPRINGFULO COLLEGE AND A GUINANE BOB YORK AND IF YOU WYORK BARBELL THATS STILL AROUND TO DAY HE'S GOING AROUND THE COUNTRY AND IN PUTTING ON HIS EXHIBITIONS THEY COME TO SPRING FILLD AN TI SORT OF LIKE A A NEW AGED A LIKE SO CHIM EOU THING WHERES LIKE THE STUDENTS KNOW IT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN THES CARPRVITT SHOWS UP TO THIS EVENT AND EVERYONE KNOWS HE HATES STRANGTH TRAINING AND EVERYONE IS LIKE WAITING FOR T TO END JUST TO SEE WHAT HE'S GON A SAY SO THIS WHOLE EXHIBITION GOES ON THESE PEOPLE ARE DOING NOT BE GETTIN REBECK THE TIME LIKE BODY BUILDING WAY LIFTING POWER LIFTING STRANG STRONG MEN IT'S LIKE ALL THE SAME THING THERE'S NO DIFFERINTIATION YETAND IT FINISHES AND CARPROVITTE STANDS UP AND LIKE THE CROWD GOES SILENT AND HE JUST ASKS ONE QUESTION HE US POINTS TO ON OF THE GUISAN SAYS SCRATCH YOUR BACK AND NOW HE JUST ASSUMING AND WAITINGFOR THE GUID TO BE LIKE AH AND NOT BE ABLE TO PUT HIS HAND BEHIND A SAD ND I THINK HE POINTED TO JOHN GAMMI CUSAK O FAMOUS BODY BUILTER AND HE REACHES BACK AND SCRATCHES BACK NO PROBLE AND THEN THEY PROCEEDED TO GRAB TWO DUNBELLS I THNK THERE WERE FIFTY POUND DUNBILLS INTO A BACKFLIP STANDING BACK LIKE WITH BOTH ANY CHANC THEY START DOING THE SPLITS ON SAGE THY START GOING PERFORMING ALL KINDS OF PHYSICAL FUNCTION TES AND AN CARPROVITTS IS STUNNED HE'S LIK WHOLLY SHE HAS NOTHING TO SAY HE LEAVES THERE AN HIS HOLE LIFE IS CHANGED ALL THESE THINGS HE WAS CLAIMING WERE SHWN IN HIS FACE TO BE FALSE HE DOES A ONE ADY ON HIS CAREER HE STARTS RUNNING STUDY AFTER STUDY ON STRENGTH TRAINING AND STARTS FINDING IMMEDIATELY THERE ARE NO DETRIMENTS TO STRENGTH TRAING IN TRUMS OF LAKE LOBAL HEALTH RIGHT OF COURSE YOU CAN DO IT WRONG AND THINGS LIKE THAT IN FACT HERE COMES A WHOLE BUNCH TOF BENEFITS SO THROUGH NINETEEN FIFTIES WHILE THIS THING'S GOING ON WITH THE ENDURANCE FOLKS NO ONE STILL STRENGTH TRAINING BECAUSE THERE'S NO THERE'S NO RECORD TO SEE THERE'S NO AMERICAN CALL JUST PORTS MEDICINE THERE'S NO SOCIETIES THERE'S NO SCIENCE OR NOT SUREO SAFE AND MEANWHILE CARVVITCH IS IS HAMMERING STUDY AFTER STUDY AFTER STUDY SHOWING YOU IT'S SAFE AND SAFE AN SAFE BUT IT HASN'T PICKED UP YET AND THEN EVERYTHING CHANGED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THANK YOUARNALD SORTZNEGGER HE CAME OUT WITH THE TRIFLED HE HITS YOU WITH PUMPING IRON WHICH I KNOW YOU NOW THAT MO BE RIGHT PUMPING INTERESTING MOV EVEN FOR THOSE NOT INTERESTED IN BODY BUILDING IT'S A VERY INTERESTING MOVI BECAUSE IT REALLY GIVES TE WINDOW IN TO NOT JUST HIM BUT THE WAY IN WHICH WAY TRAINING STARTED TO SHOW UP AS A REGULAR PRACTICE YOU KNAY WHEN I WAS GROWING UP THE ONLY PEOPLE WAYTRAIN WERE PEOPLE PREPARING FOR FOBALL BODY BUILLERS WHO BASIDIN'T EXIST IN THE TOWN WHERE I GREW UP AND THE ONLY PEOPLE DID YOGA WE'RE LIKE YOGIE'S DOING BICKRUB BUT NOW YOU DRIVE THROUGH ANY MAJOR AMERICAN CITY OR YOUR PINCITY AND THERES YOGUS STUDIOS THERE'S JIM WITH FREEWATS IF ARNOLD SHORTZNGER IS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE I THINK FOR IT FOR INITIATING THAT THAT SHIFT YET HE CAUSE HE D THINK ABOUT IT HE HIT US WITH PUMPING IRON CONAN AND IN THE TERMINATOR ALMOST IN BACK THE BACK LIKE VERY CLOSE WITHIN YOARS SO YOU'VE GOT THIS WHOLE CASCADE THE SEVENTIES OF PEOPLE RUNNING CYCLING IS SWIMMING NOW SCIENCE O SARTIN TO COME OUT THAT IT'S NOT DANGEROUS AND MAY BE ACTUALLY SOME BENEFIT AND THEN BOE NOT ALLAYS HAT IMNOT BAD FOR YOU IT CAN MAKE YOU INTO A REAL WORLD SUPER HERO  WE THINK ABOUT THE PSYCHOLOGY OF OF A CHILD GROING UP WATCHING SOMEBODY LIKE CONAN  THINK ABOUT WHAT BAT MAN LOOKED LIKE INTHE NINETEEN FIFTY O SIXTY'S RIGHT AND THEN BON I CAN LOOK LIKE THAT NOW NOT EVERYONE WANTS TO LOOK LIKE ARNAL BUT YOU SEE T IF YOU SEE THE POWER THAT CAN LANDIN PEOPLE NO ONE HAD EVER SEEN OR THOUGHT YOU CAN MAKE YOUR BODY TRANSFORMED LIKE THAT YOU COULD MAYBE BE BORN LIKE THAT BUT NO CHANCE THAT'S WITHIN THE GRASS OF ALL OF YOU WHEN I WAS A KID GROWING UP ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS WAS THE GINNIS BOOKAWORLD'S RECORDS YET I STILL HAVE IT IMAGES IN MY MIND OF THE THE A COLDEST ANIMAL YOU KNOW THETUR THE LONGEST LIES BAND ET CETERA OR HIM AND THERE WAS A PICTUREIN THERE OF ARNLD SHORTSNEGGER AND YOU KNO IT HIS RECORD WAS IS SAID PERFECTLY DEVELOPED MAN YEEYE WHICH IS AS YOU POINT OUT THAT ISN'T THE PHYSIQUE THAT MUST PEOPLE US PIR ATT BUT IT REALLY I IT DID INSPIRE THIS THE SHIP THE OTHER THING ABOUT RESISTANCE STRAINING THAT I THINK A HAS A CERTAIN ALLURE FOR SOME PEOPLE MEN AND WOMEN IS THAT IT'S ONE OF THE FEW FORMS OF EXERCISE THAT BECAUSE OF THE ENHANCED HE BLOOD FLOWED TO THE MUSCLE THAT OCCURS DURING THE TRAINING THE SO CALLED PUMP YET IT GIVES YOU A TRANSIENT BUT SOMEWHAT REAL WINDOW INTO WHAT YOURE RESULTS WILL BE HOR YOU ON TO RUN AND YOUR GASPING FOR ER YOU DON'T GET THE YOU AREN'T EXPERIENCING WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE FASTER THAN YOU ARE THAT DAY AT'S R BUT WHEN YOU WAIT TRAIN YOU GET AND ESTHETIC PICTURE INTO HOW YOUR FUNCTIONALITY AN ESTHETIC WILL CHANGE IT DISAPPEARS A FEW HOURS LATER SOR AS THE THE SO CALL PUMPS OF SUBSISES BUT IT'S A VERY AN INTERESTING FORM OF EXERCISE IN THAT WAY IT'S ALMOST AS IF YOU GO INTO LEARN A LANGUAGE AND DURING THE PROCESS OF LEARNING FOR BRIEF MOMENTS YOU'RE ACTUALLY FLUENT AND THEN A GT TAKEN AWAY YET ITS WHAT PUTS THE DOPOMEN CARRET OUT IN FRONT OF YOU YET THIS IS JUST ME HYPOTHESISING AS TO WHY WAIGHT TRAINING MIGHT HAVE A TAKEN OFF THE WAY THETYT AN MI'S LIKE IF YOU GOT PAID EVERY HOUR ON THE HOUR WE YOU'RE WORKING IN THE TT THING OF THE DAY LIKE THY TAKE THE MONEY BACK BUT YOU STILL LIKE AS THE TIME CLOCK IS GOING ON YOUR DAY YOU'RE LOOKING UP YOU TOT SEENG WHY YOU'RE WATCHING YOUR BANK ACCOUNT GROW IN REAL LIFE LIKE YOU CAN SEE WHY IT'S SO ADDICTING TO THOSE FOLKS SO TO FINISH THE STORY HE'RE WHAT GOING BACK YOUR ACTUAL QUESTION ANSWER THIS IS HAPPENING THE LATE SEVENTIES EARLY EIGHTIES AND SO NOW JO WEADER ALL THESE GEMS THEY'RE EXPLODING BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT A LOOK LIKE THAT OR IF THEY HADE THEY REALIZE THAT HAVE THE CHANCE TO CHANGE HOW THEY PHYSICALLY LOOK THAT HAD NEVER BEEN A REALITY BEFORE YOU EASIATLY MEN AT THAT POINT I'M ALMOST YES ILUCIVELY YET FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF REASONS CULTURAL EXCEPTANCE ET CETERA EVEN WITHIN DURANCE STUFF YOU COAL GET FITTER AND RUN FASTER N THAT'S BETTER BUT I GESN WASN'T GOING TO CHANGE HOW YOU LOOKED UNLESS YOU WERE LOSING FAT NOW YOU CAN CHANGE HOW YOU LOOK WHICH IS SO INCREDIBLY DICTING FACTORS OF A VERY FAMOUS QUOK I THINK IT'S LIKE A GOWEADER WHO SAID SHOW ME ONE MAN WHO WANTS TO BE STRONG AND 'LL SHOW YOU TEN A AN A LOOKSTRONG RIGHTS LIKE THAT'S VERY VERY POWERFUL RIGHT THIS IS A WHOLE LIKE THE HLT DIS TON O THIS HISTORY IN'T GOING TO WITH IS  SORT OF EXPLAINING TO BUT NOW YOU KNOW YOUR THE MENATIES AND YOU HAVE WHAT I CALL MY GENERATION SO YOU HAVE MY GENERATION WHO FALN LOVE A STRAING TRAINING THE EIGHTEEN IN N NINETEEN EIGHTY'S NINETIES BUT THERE'S REALLY NO SCIENTIFIC FIELD FOR IT IT'S NOT REALLY COME ABOUT YET THE SCIENCE OF ENDURANCE AND EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY IS NOW HUMMING ALONG IN A MASSIVE RATE BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE CAME UP WIN THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES AND THERE FIVE TEN FIFTEEN YEARS IN THEIR CARER THEY'RE PRODUCING THEY'RE GN IT THEY'R GENERING GRADUAL STUDENTS THEY'RE STARTING ON LABS AND THE EXCISE PHYSIOLOGY STILL TO THIS DAYIS EIGHTY PER CENT ENDURANCE STEADY STATESTUP ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY WELL NOW MIKE MY GENERATION YOU LOVE YOU LOVE SPORTS YOU LOVE LIFTING YOU ALOF ALL THESE THINGS AND NOW WE SEE HAPIN IS THE CHICAGO BULLS MICHAEL GEORGE STARTS PICKING UP STRAIN TRAIN WOH THAT'S AN THAT'S ON TIVS ON SPORTS IN ER NDN MID NINETEEN NINETY'S LIFTING WAIGHTS AND WE GO BACK ACTUALLY TO THE AE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND I'M I'M NOT SURE OF YOUR FOOTBALL FAN BUT ANY FOOTBALLFANWILL RECOGNIZE THEN ABRASKA CORN HUSKERS IND H NINETEEN SEVEN EIGTYES AND EIGHTIES CHANGE HA FOOPULSE PLAYED WELL THE REASON IT'S BECAUSE THEY START A STRAING TRAINING AND HIT STRAT OF DOING IT WITH THE GINAME BOY ET BELIEVE WHO IS THE FOUNDER OF THE ANNACE SO THE NATIONAL STRENGTH AND ITIOING ASSOCIATION IS FORMED IN THE LIGHT NINETEEN SEVENTIES AS WELL SO JUST LIKE ACY AND WAS DEVELOPED THE YEAR AFTER THOSE TWO EVENTS HAPPENED NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT THE YEAR AFTER ORTOL COMES OUT BOME ANDA SEA IS FORMED AND NOW YOU HAVE A SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZATION DEDICATED DISTRAIN THIN ADDITION YOU'VE GOT AND A FELL STRENGTH INISHONING COACHES THAT ARE STARTING TO COME ON BOARD YOU'VE GOT SCIENTISTS THAT ARE STARTING TO COME AND ELAPSE AND STRENGTH IDITIONY BECAMES TO SCIENTIFIC FIELD WELL EVERY THING SWINGS NOW FROM AN EXERCISE PERSPECTIVE INTO BODY BUILDINGAND SO ALMOST ALL  THE THINGS IN FACT WE WERE SORT OF TALKING BEFORE I COULD RUN A WHOLE BUNCH OF TRICKS ON YOU AND I COULD ASK YOU A WHOLE BUNCH OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS YOU THINK ARE ABSOLUTE STANDARDS ARE GUARANTEEDS ABOUT TRAINING I'M SUPPOSED TO DO THIS I'M NEVER SUPPOSED TO DO THAT FOR INSTANCE I FOR INSTANCE IS IT OL CAY TO TRAIN A MUSCLE GROUP ON BACK TO BACK DAYS MOST PEOPLE ARE AT HOME THINKING NO YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TRAIN A MUSCLENEES TO RECOVERY AND THAT'S TOTAL NONSENSE RIGT I'M OTHER THINGS LIKE BODY PART SPLIT TRAINING RIHT TRAINING ONE MUSCLE GROUP PER DAY IM OTHER THINGS LIKE CARDIO ENDURANCE TRAINING INFLUENCING WILL IT RUIN MY GAINS FOR MY LIFT ALL THESE THINGS ARE ON AT A A BASE OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT COME FROM BODY BUILDINGNOW THAT'S A FANTASTIC WORL BUT BECAUSE EVERYTHING STARTED IN THE EIGHT NINETEEN SEVENTIES AS BODY BUILDING S TURNS A BASICA STRENGTH TRAINING WAS THAT WAIGHT LIFTING AN POWER LIFTING WERE NOT AT ALL AROUND RIGHT THEY WERE BUT NOBODY CARED AGAIN SHOW ME SOMEBONE WHO WANTS TO BE STRONG I'LL SHOW YOU TEN A ON A LOOKSTRON THE PHYSIQUE THING JUST DOMINATED AND WE'RE WE'RE NOT GETTING OUT OF THAT YET I WERE NOT ALVOY OUT OF IT WE'RE STARTING TO THEM BECAUSE HERE'S WHY PEOPLE STRAR TO REALIZE THIS THIS BODY BUILDING DING IS FANTASTIC I CAN CHANGE MY PHYSIQUE I'M GETTING BETTER BUT DAMN THESE WORK OUTS TAKE AN HOUR ANDA HALF TWO HOURS ANDI'M AN A SPEND THAT WHOLE TIME ON ONE OR TWO BODY PARTS WHICH MEAS I'M GOING TO HALF TO LIFT SIX DAYS A WEEK AND I'M N AFTER THAT CONSISTENTLY RIGHT NOW ILL SEND BOM TWO HOURS ON MY ON MY ELBOW FLECTERS DAMN MY ELBOWSTRTNTO HURT AND YET MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY REQUIRE TWO HOURS TO DAY NOT AT ALL TRAINING IN ORDER TO GET BENEFITS EVEN JUST FOR HYPERTROPHY TOTALLY BUT BUT A  A LOT OF TIME YOU GEN TO HAVE TO GET SOME AMOUNT OF TIME IN BECAUSE YOU'RE SPENDING SO MUCH ISOLATION SO WE'VE GONE AWAY FROM TRAINING MOVEMENT RUNNING IS A MOVEMENT CYCLING IS A MOVEMENT I'M TRAINING MY BYSEPS IS A MUSCLE AR BOT MUSCLE GROUP I'M TRAINING MY HAND STRINGS ARE A MUSCLE GROUP IT'S NOT A HUMAN MOVEMENT SO WE'VE DONE A ONE EIGHTY IN TERMS OF SELECT IN THE EXERCISES FROM MOVEMENT BASE PRESCRIPTION TWO NOW MUSCLE GROUP BASE TRAINING SOWHEN YOUR ICOATING MUSCLE GROUPS THAT MEANS A WHOLE TRUNK OF YOUR BODY IS REALLY NOT DOING MUCH THROUGHOUT THE DAY SO WHAT HAPPENS IF YOUR DOING SAY LEGS ON MONDAY AND YOU MISS MY NAKA JRON A FLIGHT NOW YOUR LEGS HAVE TO WAIT A WHOLE NOTHER WEEK RAET'S THE SUCION THATBIT SO THIS DUST BECOME PROBLEMATIC PEOPLE'S OR ARE GETTING BEAT UPS PEOPLE START REALIZING I CAN NOT FEEL THAT GREAT I'M NOT SUPERFIT I'M SWEATING JUST WALKING UP THE STAIRS I'M OUT OF BREATH WHY BECAUSE ALL THAT TRAINING YOU'VE DONE NOTHING FOR YOUR CARTY OF ASCIR FITNESS YOU'VE DONE NOTHING TO IMPROVE I'M HEARTRAIGHT OXYGENATION BLOODFLOW AND SO THAT PARODIAM SWAING WAY TOO HARD INTO THE EXERCISING ESPECIALLY LIFTING WEIGHTS IS SINGLE JOINT OFTEN MACHINE OFTEN SLOW OFTEN HIGH VOLUME ISOLATION SO AND THAT LEFT A GINT OPENING OF PEOPLE GOING AWAIT A MINUTE WHAT IF YOU COUL GET INTO GEM I COULD PROMISE YOU THE SAME OR BETTER RESULTS AND UNDER THIRTY MINUTES AND I FACT YOU ALSO FEEL BETTER YOU'LL LOSE MORE WEIGHT AND THAT OPENED UP GROUP EXERCISE CLASSES KETTLEBELL STUFF CROSS FIT TYPE OF SOFF CIRCUIT TRAINING BECAUSE YOU CAN COME IN YOU WON'T GET SO BEAT UP CAS THE VOLUMES LOWER THE TIME IS MUCH LOWER YOU GET MOLTIPULE ADAPTATION AT THE SAME TIME GREAT THE PROBLEM WITH THAT THOUGH FAST FOR TEN YEARS IS IT STARTED BURYING PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU'VE NOW D EMPHICIZE MOVEMENT QUALITY AND YOU'VE OVER EMPECISE SCORES RIGHT SO THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE IF YOU GO ANYOU WATCH PUMPING IRON YOU'LL SEE ORE ANYBODY BI YOU'LL SEE IF THEY'RE DOING A BY  SEPCRO THEY DON'T EVEN REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THE REP RANGE THEY DON'T REALLY PAY TEN TO TH LOAD THEY'RE LOOKING AT THEIR MUSCLE ERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO I GET THAT THING TO FIRE THEY'RE SQUEEZING TEIRE FLEX ING THEIR POSING AT THE END OF EVERY SET THERE TRN FIGUR OUT OM MI GETTNG ENOUGH POMP IT IS EXCLUSIVELY FOUNDED ON EXERCISE QUALITY THE REP RANGE THE NUMBERS ALMOST A RELOFIT WHEN YOU GO THE OTHER MODEL EXERCISE TECHNIQUE IT DOESN'T MATTER JUST GET THE MOST AMONT OF WEIGHT UP OR THEM MOUNT OF RAPS OR THE FASTEST TIME ET CETERA CETERA HIGH BE THE CROS FIT I'VE WALK PASSOM CROSS FITS YUSE HAVE DONE TOO CROSS THAT 'LL O IS SO YOU SAID CROSSFAT I DIDN'T OH I ON'T KNOW I I ENJOYED THE I DEFILY I FELT LIKE IAWAS WORKING HARD I OH YOU I OBSERVED A LOT OF PEOPLE IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY UMDOING OLYMPIC LIFTS AND DOING KIPPING THAT'S WHERE YOU KICKY LEGS FOLKS SO YOU NO SORT LIKE BUCKING AND AND KIPPING TIGHT PULL UPS A NO I I ENJOYED IT A IT WASN'TFOR ME FOR THE LONG TERM BUT IT DID SEEM THAT THERE WAS A A LOT OF BOLLISTIC MOVEMENT IN GOSE PROXIMITY TO OTHER PEOPLE AN SO THE HAZARD TO ME SEEM MORE ABOUT THAT THAN THE ACTUAL MOVEMENTS WELL AGAIN THA THE POINT OF SETTING UP HERE IS THAT WAS ACTUALLY A REALLY BRILLIANT SOLUTION FOR A LOT OF PROBLEMS THE CLASSIC BODY BILDING HYPERCHFY INTRODUCED SO I' GOT AWAY FROM ISOLATION MOVEMENTS AND GOT PEOPLE DOING BIG MOVEMENTS WHICH ARE MORE EFFECTIVE GENERALLY BETTER I GOT PEOPLE DOING THINGS FAST AND EXPLOSIVE THAT'S MORE ATHLETIC THAT IS MORE IMPORTANT FOR LONGEVITY IT SOLVED A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS JOINT HEALTH WASN'T ETTING CRASHED THE ISSUE THEY WENT WITH IS THEY JUST PUSHED THE PACE ON SCORE RATHER THAN QUALITY THEY PUSH THE PACE ON HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN BE IN HERE T THE SAME TIME SO NOW YOU'RE DOING HIGHE RISK MOVEMENTS HIGHER INTENSITY HIGHER FATIGUE AND WITH A TOTAL NOT THAT THEY DON'T CARE ABOU TECHNIQUE BUT IT'S NOT THE THING THAT THEI'R MOST CONCERNED ABOUT IT'S GETTING THE NUMBER AN THE THING DONE THEY STALL THE TIME ISSUE THOUGH YOU CAN GET TREMENDOUS RESULTS IN THREE DAYS A WEEK UNDER FORTY FIVE MINUTES EACH SESSION ET CETERA BURN PEOPLE OT THOUGH WAI TOO MUCH HIGH INTENSITY WEIGHT TOO OFTEN AND THE OTHER PROBLEM SAFETY CONCERNS ALL KINDS OF WORTH O PETIC ISSUES AND OTHER STO CAN I A INTERRUPT YOU FOR MOMEN  JUST ASK YA QUESTION AS WE GO THROUGH THIS ART OF THE HISTORY OF WHY ENDURANCE TRAINING PREDOMINATED OR STRAINTH TRAINING OR BODY BUILDING TYPE TRAINING OR CROSS FIT TYPE TRAINING CAUSE I THINK THIS IS FASTENING I KNOW WHERE ABOUT TO ARRIVE AT WHERE WE ARE TO DAY AN WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE FOR FOR PEOPLE IN WHAT THEY SHOULD FOCASS ON AND DU AT WHAT POINT IF ANY DO YOU THINK RESISTANCE TRAINING STARTED TO BECOME ADOPTED MY WOMEN YOU KNOW THERE WAS NO EQUIVALENT OF ARNOLD SCHWORTS NEGGER THERE WAS A LINDA HAMILTON AN THE TERMINATOR YE AM THERE AR SOME IMPRESSIVE A PHYSIQUES CERTAINLY ON A FEMALE ACTRESSES AND A ATHLETS UM THE WILLIUM SISTERS YOU KNOW VERY PRESSIVE I MUSCULATUREN PHYSIQUES AND OF COURSE THEIR TENSPLAYING YEGS FOR ITSELF U HAS THAT HAPPENED YET I MEAN YET WHAT I MEAN IS A DO YOU THINK SINCE YOU WORKD WITH BOTH MEN AND WOMEN YE UM DO YOU THINK THAT MOST WOMEN UNDERSTAND TAT WEIGHT TRAINING UM DONE PROPERLY IS GOING TO BE EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL FOR THEM MAYBE EVEN ESPECIALLY FOR THEM IN TERMS OF AM OFFSETTING BONDENSITY LOST AND THINGS OF THAT SORT M OR WE STILL WAITING FOR THE STIMUA THE A POPULAR A STIMULUS FOR GETTING YOU KNOW EIGHTY PERCENT OF OF YOUNG WOMEN THINKING I WANT E LIFT WAIHTS YET UM HART FOR MANY ANCERCAS EM NOT I'M NOT A WOMAN RIGHT NOW I HAVE A DAUGHTER SHES FOR SALULT WILL SEE I'M WHAT I CAN SAY IS IS I'VE PROBABLY WORKED WITH I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PROFESSIONALTHINS IN TOTAL A LOT I'VE WORKED WITH THEM PROBABLY FOURTEEN PEROFESSIONAL SPORTS A'VE WORKED WITH SA YOUNG WINNERS ENVY PES LIKE THE WHOLE ALLALL THE CREDENTIALS RIGHT I BET THIRTY FIVE FORTY PERCENT THE LE THITS HAVE WORKED WITH OUR FEMALE SO I'VE WORKED WITH E LIMPIC OLD METALISTS AVE WORKE WITH A BRONZE METALIS AND UNMULTIPLE SPORTS AVE WORKE WITH O THE MOST DECORATED POWER LIFTER OF ALL TIMES SO IN A NUMBER OF THESE AREAUS FIGHTERS WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP ALL THESE THINGS IM FROM ME I FEEL LIKE THAT VERSES OREA YO HAP UM MY STUDENTS IF YOU LOOK AT MY CLASS ROOM I I DON'T NOWAT THE NUMBERS ARE BUT THERE IS NO SMALL NUMBER OF FEMALES IN EXERCISE SCIENCE AND EXESS PHYSIOLOGY IM IF YOU LOOK IN OUR LABORATORIES THAT'S ONE THING YOU WILL SEE THERE ARE VERY FEW FEMALE EXERCISE SCIENCES THERE ARE VERY FEW A FEMALE STRAINED INISIONIN COACHES BUT THAT NUMBER IS IS IS COMING DOWN AA ASTRONOMICAL RAT  YOU HAVE A PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING HIRED I'M IN EVERY SPORT A YOU PICK THE ANOFAL YOU PICK MATRI BASEBALL EVERY EVERY FEMONTHS WERE HEARING FIRST FEMALE HIRED FOR THIS FIRST F EMALE HIRED FOR THAT AM THE YANKEES RACHEL RACHEL ABOUT VIS FANTASTIC YOU NOT YET YET RACHEL'S BEEN OUT TO MY LAB SHE'S TURRIFICT YEH YE YE THAT'S THAT SHE'S FANTASTIC AN SHE'S NOW BEING HIRED AS EI THINK SHE'S A HITTING COACH NOW ACTUAL'S WORK I SHE SHE'S GOIN TO BE A JAM T THAT'S THIS HERGOL SHE'S A TERMINATOR AM SO THAT THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING AND MY SUDENT THAT ARE COMING THROUGH OUR PROGRAM AURE GETTING PLACE IN THESE RULES THEY HAVEN'T GOTT THROUGH YET A LOT AND TERMS OF BEING AN ACTUAL SCIENTISTS  BUT THEY'RE GETTING THERE AM S MORE SCIENCEIS TN BEABING HIRED FEMALES AND FROMS LIKE BIG DATA COLLECTIONS WHAR SCIENCE AN TACK WILL COVER YOU KNOW A AN AN ANOTHER DISCUSSION BUT I THINK I'S HAPPENING WHETHER NOT THE THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL PR I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT ANT EQUATION WHAT I CAN' SPEAK TO THOU IS  ONE OF THINGS I THINK IS IS MOST FUN COMING FOR D SCIENTIFICALLY IS YOU KNW A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO AND I AT CAME BACKLY CAME THROUGH WIT THEIR MANDATES O SAING IT'S NO LONGER ACCEPTABLE TO EXCLUDE WOMEN FRO'M SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH RI AS WE JUST DID THAT FOR THAT CASE WELL WHAT HAPPENED I AJUST TO FILL THIS IN COSSESTING IT'S WORTH NOTING IS THAT FOR MANY YEARS AM STUDIES EVEN ON ROAD INTS YE WE'RE MAINLY CARRIED OUT ON MALEROAD INS BECAUSE THE A SUMPTION AND THE ASSUMPTION TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG BUT THE ASSUMPTION WAS THAT THE PHYSIOLOGY OF FEMALE RODINS BECAUSE TEY DON'T HAVE A MENSTRUAL CYCLEIS NOT TWENTY EIGHTDAYS OF AN ESTRA CYCLE ITS FOR DAYS AR A DIFFERENT TYPE OF CYCLE THAT THT WOULD SOMEHOW DISTRUPT THE DATA TURNS OUT THAT'S ENTIRELY WRONG NOW IT'S ACTUALLY REQUIRED A WHEN YOU SIT ON TA GRANT STUDY PANEL I WHICH THE PEOPLE VALUE HE GRANTS YOU THEY ASK THEY LITERALLY SAY DID THEY MEET THE CARTERIA FOR SEC AS A BIOLOGICAL VARIABLE HEREWERE NOCH ABOUT SECS AS THE VERB REEMAS EXIST A A BIOLOGICAL SEC AND AM IF YOU DON'T SAY YES THAT'S A STRONG HIT AGAINST THE GRANT ANYOU SAY YES THEN IT CHECKS OFF THAT BOX SO IT'S NOW REQUIRED THEY BOTH MALE AND FEMALE ROADINS AND HUMANS BE STUDIED AN A GIVEN STUDY UNLESS THE STUDY IS SPECIFIALLY GEARED TOWARD UNDERSTANDING THAT ONLY EXISTS IN ONE  YET ON ERE THE OTHER POPULATIO SUCH AS A A METAPAUS FR E ESTENCE YEMENSTRUAL CYCLE A ANTROPAUS A FOR INSTANCE BUT AM  THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANTI'M EXCITED TO HEAR THAT AM SO WER  WARLS CAN TO GO WITHTHAT IS ACTUALLY SO THAT WIL STEP ONE WHICH IS COOL YOU GOT INCLUDE WHET WE HAVEN'T GOTTN TO YET BUT I'VE SEEN MORE AND MORE GRAND APPLICATIONS COME THROUGH FOR THIS ITS JUST THE FUNNING HASN'T YET WHICH IS IT'S ONE THING TO IN TO LET WOMEN BE IN THE SAME STUDIES THAT'S GREAT IT'S ANOTHER THING THOUGH TO STAR PERFORMING HIGH PERFORMANCE RESEARCH SPECIFICALLY FOR FEMALE QUESTIONS THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED YET THAT'S JUST LIKE A FUNNING ISSUER WE HAVEN'T GOTTN MONEY YET PEOPLE AREN'T AREN'T SUPPORTING THAT WE DO'T GET A LOT OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR SPORT SCIENCE BUT WE HAN'T CAN'T TRACT ON THE MONEY YET OF SOMETHING ME GOING I WANT TO DO A STUDY IN FEMALE AT THIN SIENCER FEMALE ATHIC QUESTIONS THESE WON'T HELP MEN THESE ARE QUESTIONS SPECIFIC TO THE FEMALE THAT'S THE NEXT TOUT RIGHT THAT'S WHERE WE GOT TO GET TO SO WE CAN STIC MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY A AROUND TRAINING O RECOVERY OR OR WE SHOULDN'T OR T DOESN'T MATTER THAT THERE'S SOME THERE'S A HANDFUL OF NOT LOWER QUALITY BUT LIKE SOME STUDIES IM I DON'T LOVE THEM YET THERE JUST NEEDS TO BE A TINOL WORK O BIRTH CONTROLIS A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE IT WTHE THE INFORMATION FOR WOMEN AT FEMALE ATHLETES OR EVEN JUST LIKE HARD EXERCISERS YOU I HAVE TO BE COMPETTERED ABOUNTLY AROUND WHAT IS WORTH CONTROL DOING WHAT TYPES HOW SHOULD I MANAGE THAT WHAT CONVERSATIONS SHOULD I BE HAVING WITH MY DOCTOR ALMOST NOTHING LIKE WOMEN HAVE NOTHING TO GO ON FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE SO WHAT IF I'M TRYING TO COMPETE IN EVENT OR OR RUN A RAYS HOW LIKE ALL THOSE TYPES OF QUESTIONS SHOULD BE ANSWERED A NORMANO VALUE NORMAN OF DATA I PERFORM US TESTING I IT'S JUST NOT THERE ON THE FEMALE SO THAT'S AN ARRY I I THINK TI IF SOMEBODY REALY WANTED TO MAKE A CHANGE THAT THE SCIENCIS WANT TO DO IT I KNOW I'VE TALK TO SO MANY IN OUR FIELD THAT WOULD REALLY LOVE TO EXPLORE IT O BECAUSE IT'S GETTING THERE THE THETH TIK CUS SAT THE COACHING SIDE IT'S GETTING THERE THEIR SEEN THAT THEY'R HIRING THESE PEOPLE I'M SEEN IN IN MY STUDENTS IM THEY ON MY MY FOLLOWINGS IS NOT ALL MEN TIT GITS VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF FEMALES AND ALL I DO AS MOST ABOUT EXCIZE SCIENCEIN LIKE THIS ALL I DO SO WILL THIS PARD CEST IS A VERY WE KNOW VERY CLEARLY THE AUDIENCE O IS FIFTY PER CENT WOMEN FIFTY PER CENT MEN THAT'S RONS WHICH IS GREAT SO JUST TO JUMP BACK AT OUR HISTORY DISCUSSION AND TO FINISH THAT POINT O WHERE R AT NOW AN WHERE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GO OR SHOULD GO SO WE WALK THROUGH THE BODY BUILDING COUNT OF RUNNING EVERYTHING AND PEOPLE WALKING INTO A GIM ANY TIME THEY LIFT AWAIGHTS THER THER MAKING ALL THEIR CHOICES BASED IN THE ASSUMPTION THAT MAXIMIZING MUSCLE SIZE IS THE GOLL AND CLEARLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE ER OTHER ADAPTATIONS YOU MAY BE AFTER SO WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THAT HAD PROBLEMS THAN WE TALKED ABOUT HOW SOMEBOTYESE OTHER FORMS OF EXERCISE FILLED THOSE GAPS AND THEN WHAT PROBLEMS THOSE THINGS INTRODUCE WELL I THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY AT A SPOINT WERE THT PENDULUM IS KIND OF SLOWLY SHIFTING INTO THE MIDDLE WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS IF YOU WANT TO MAXIMIS MUSCLE STRENGTH WE LOOK TOWARDS THE POWER LIFTING COMMUNITY YOU WANT TO MAXIMIAS MUSCLE POWER ORIT LOOK THE WAYLIFTING COMMUNITY WE WANT TO LOOK FOR MUSCULAR ENDURANCE R WELL ROTENIS MAYBE WE LOOK IN THE CROSSIT COMMUNITIES AND SOMEBODYES OBSTCAL COURSE RACES OR FUNCTIONALITYTHING SO WHAT WE CAN DO NOW ITS GENERATE PROTOCALS THAT GET US THE EXACT ADAPTATIONS WE WANT AND NOT ONES WE DON'T WANT BECAUSE WE CAN LOOK BACK AT EACH OF THESE DIFFERENT STYLES OF TRAINING AND PICK AND CHESE OPTIMLE PROTOCALS OR COMBINATIONS FOR THEM SO SOMEBODY'S SIMPLY WANTS TO GET HEALTHY LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT WHEN WE LISTED THE NINE ADAPTATIONS AND I MENTIONED HEALTH WASN'T ONE OF THEM THAT'S BECAUSE WHAT DETERMINES YOUR HEALTH VERSE IS WHAT DETERMINES MY OFTOMY HEALTH DIFFERS SO IF I NEED MORE HYPERTROPHE I CAN LOOK TOWARDS BODY BUILDING CONCEPTS BUT IF I HAVE ENOUGH OR MAYBE FOR PERSONAL REASONS I DECIDE I HAVE TOO MUCH RI DON'T WANT TO ADD ANY MORE THEN I CAN SAY EIHT HOW CAN I GET STRONGER WITHOUT GETTING BIGGER AND BORE MY LOOK TORDS PIRLIFTING CONCEPTS HOW CAN I GET MORE POWERFUL HOW CAN I GET FASTER BUT I DON'T TA NOW AGAIN WANT TO LOSE FAT O GAGREY OR IF I WANT PHYSIQUE CHANGES SO WE HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT AREAS WE CAN PICK AND CHOOSE FROM THAT HAVE EXPERATESE IN SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS AND DEVELOP OURSELVES PERFECT PROTOCALLS A BASED ON THAT INFORMATION I'D LIKE TO TAKE A BRIEF BREAK TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR SPONSER INSIDE TRACKER INSIDE TRACKERS A PERSONALIZED NUTRITION PLATFORM THAT ANALYZES DATA FROM YOUR BLOOD ENDIAN E TO HELP YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR BODY AND HELP YOU REACH YOUR HEALTH GOALS I'VE LONG BEEN A BELIEVER IN GETTING REGULAR BLOOD WORK DONE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAN MANY OF THE FACTORS THAT IMPACT YOUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURM HEALTH AND WELL BEING CAN ONLY BE ANALYZED FROM A QUALITY BLOOD TESTS ONE ISSUE WITH A LOT OF BLOOD TESTANTYANATUS OUT THERE HOWEVER IS THAT YOU GET INFORMATION BACK ABOUT VERIOUS LEVELS OF LIPPIDS AND HORMONES AN METABOLIC FACTORS ET CETERA BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT INFORMATION INSIDE TRACKER MAKES KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THAT INFORMATION EXCEEDINGLY EASY THEY HAVE A PERSONALIZED PLATFORM THAT LETS YOU SEE WHAT YOUR SIPIS IC NUMBERS ARE OF COURSE BUT THEN ALSO WHAT SORTS OF BEHAVIOUR OLD DUES AND DONTS WHAT SORTS OF NUTRISIONAL CHANGES WHAT SORTS OF SUPPLEMENTATION WOULD ALLOW YOU TO BRING THOSE LEVELS INTO THE RANGES THAT ARE OPTIMOL FOR YOU IF YOUD LIKE TO TRY INSIDE TRACKER YOU CAN VISIT INSIDE TRACKER DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET TWENTY PER SENT OFF ANY OF INSIDE TRACKERS PLANS AGAIN THAT'S INSIDE TRACKER DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF SO WITH THE UNDERSTANDING IN MINE AS TO HOW WE ALL MYSELF INCLUDED ARRIVED IT SUCH LOPSIDED FITNESS TOO MUCH ENDURANCE NOT ENOUGH STRENGTH TOO MUCH STRENGTH NOT ENOUGH ENDURANCE AT'S REALLY HARD TO IMAGINE ANY ONE'S PERFECT IN THIS REGARD CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH THE NINE DIFFERENT ADAPTATIONS THAT YOU MENTIONED EARLIER AND GIVE US AWAY TO A SESS OUR LEVEL OF ABILITY OR OUR LEVEL OF ADAPTATION IN EACH OF THOSE NINE ARE IT THE VERY FIRST ONE WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS IS MOVEMENT SKILL NOW SET ASIDE SPORT SPECIFIC O I'M NOT GOINGOGIVEOUG A SESSIMENT FOR OPTIBAL GOLF TECHNIQUE SWING IS IS REALLY ABOUT HUMAN MOVEMENTS TO TH YOU STAY INJURY FREE AND YOU CAN CONTINUE TO TRAIN FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE SO WOAR O THE MINIMEREQUIREMENTS NOW IF YOU CAN HAVE ACCESS SO A HIGHLY QUALIFIED PHYSICAL THERAPIST OR MOVEMENT SPECIALIST THAT'S THE BEST ROUT RIGHT GO TO THEM HAVE THEM IDENTIFY ALL OF YOUR MOVEMENT PATTERNS OVERHEAD PRESS ING SQUATTING RUNNING ALL THESE THINGS THAT'S YOUR GOLD STANDARD IF YOU WANT TO DO IT YOURSELF THOUGH HEREIS AA VERY SIMPLE FORETUPSOLUTION SO THE WAY THAT I IT TEACH US IS LIKE GO JOINT BY JOINT AND SO I I THINK OF THIS JUS AS THE MAJOR ONES YOUR SHOULDER YOUR ELBOW YOUR LOW BACK HIP KNEE AND ANKLE  NOW WHAT YOU CAN DO IS DO A REPRESENTATIVE MOVEMENT FOR YOU SO IF YOU BENTURE LOT USE THE BAUT IF YOU DO PULL UPS YOUSE SU PULL UP IF YOU SQUAT DO THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND DOING AN UPPER BODY PRESS AN OPPER BODY PULL A LOWER BODY PRESS LOWER BODY PULL AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE A PUSH UP A PULL UP OR A BENT ROW A SQUAT AN THEN A DEADLIFT NOW WOULD BE A VERY VERY WELL R OUNDED APPROACH WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS DO THAT MOVEMENT AND  IWOULD RECORD IT TFOR YOURSELF AND IN RECORD AFFRONT OF YOU AND A SIDE VIEU I PROB'BLY DO THREE THE TEN REPETITIONS PUR ANGLE OK SLOW IN  CONTROL YOU DON'T NEED ME BODYWAYHT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS MOVE AND YOU WANT O LOOK FOR FOUR KEY THINGS AT EVERY JOINT IT SO I AGAIN IMAGINE OF DOING A SQUAT I'M IN TOR DO A SQUAT A'M IN A FOCUS ON JUST MY ANKLE AN'M A LOOK FOR THESE FOUR THINGS OF THE ANKLE AND THEN AN I'M N TO GO BACK AND WATCH MY KNEE AND LOOK FOR THESE SAME FOUR THINGS THE NEE TO THE HIP ET CETERA RIHT SO WHERE THESE FOR THINGS NUMBER ONE AS YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR SYMMETRY SO SYMMETRY IS FRONT TO BACK LEFT OR RIGHT AND A YOUR RIGHT LIMB IN YOUR LEFT LIM  AND SO WE WE WANT TO LOOK FOR OR AND IF THEY AREN'T MOVING PERFECTLY THAT'S FINE BUT YOU WANT TO SEE IS ONE MOVING FURTHER AHEAD THAN THE OTHER ONE IS ONE A TURNING TO THE SIDE ONE'S NT IS ONE FIDGETING IN AND TWITCHING AROUND DIFFERNTLY SO YOU WANT TO LOOK JUST O CHECK TO SEE AND MAKE SURE THAT THEIR STABLE THAT'S ONE I'M NUMBER TWO YOU WANT LOOK FOR STUBILITY SO KEY INDICATORS HERE ARE THINGS LIKE IF YOU IF YOU CAN'T CONTRUE A A SQUAT A CONTROLLED SQUAT WHERE YOUR KNEES DON'T START SHAKING I THAT WOULD BE AN INSTABILITY ISSUE SO CAN YOU DO THE MOVEMENT SLOW CAN YOU POSIT THE BAT A MAY BE THREE SECONDS MAY BE FIVE SECONDS OR TEN YOU SHOULD HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OF THAT MOVEMENT AT ALL OF THESE JOINTS I'M ARE YOUR HIP SLIDINTO ONES SIDE WHEN YOU STAND UP IS ONE ELBOW CLOSER TO YOUR BODY WHEN YOU'RE BENCHING AN TH OTHER ONE'S MORE FLARED OUT THESE AR THE THINGS I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT WHAT ANGLE THEY SHOULD BE AT OR NOT YOU'RE SIMPLY LOOKING FOR A SYMMETRIES OR INSTABILITIES RE U SO AGAIN AS YOU'RE PUSHING UP TOES ONE ELBOW START FLIPPING AND TWITCHING AND GOING ALL OF THE PLACE THE THIRD ONE IS WHAT I CALL AWARENESS SO A THERE ARE LOT OF MOVEMENT TECHNIQUE ISSUES THAT ARE SIMPLY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW AND SO YOU'LL WATCH THEM SQUAT I DO THIS ON MY CLASSES ALL THE TIME I'LL HAVE A HUNDRED KISS OUT THEIR SQUATTING AND YOU'LL EE SOME HORRIBLE SQUAT TECHNIQUE AND WHEN YOU JUST TELL THEM AY DID YOU REALIZE YOUR HEELS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE GROUND ALL TIMES IN YOU SQUAT LIKE OH  AND THEY CAN CORRECT IT'S NOT ACTUALLY MOVEMENT FLOT IT WAS JUST SIMPLY AN AWARENESS I DIDN'T KNOW AND THEN I ACTUALLY DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THAT WAS HAPPENING THAT POSITIONSO WE WANT ALL OF OUR JOINTS TO BE GOING THROUGH A GENERAL FUL RANGE OF MOTION WHICH IS NUMBER FOR SO THE ANKLES A DORING LIKE A SQUAT YOUR KNEE SHOULD BEABLE TO GO FAR OVER YOUR TOSTS POSSIBLE WHILL MAINTAINING GOOD POSITION YOUR FEET FLAT ON THE FLOOR YOUR YOUN THREE POINTS OF CONTACT YOUR WHOLE FOOT FOOT ANDYOU'RE NOT COMPROMISING ANOTHER JOINT SO THAT'S ALL YOUR GOING TO LOOK FOR THOSE FOUR THINGS SYMMETRY STABILITY AWARENESS AND RANGE OF MOTION THROUGH EACH JOINT THREACH MOVEMENT IT SOUNDS A DIFFICULT AND TIME CSTOM IT'S REALLY NOT  YOU CAN GENERALLY KIN O CLEAR THESE THINGS IN ONE OR TWO REPETITIONS IN A COUPLE OF SECONDS AND WHAT YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO LOOK FOR THIS LOTS OF SCORING SCHEMES YOU CAN YE TASKET  PHYSICALTHERAPUS ASS OR YOU I JUST LOOK FOR ABS ALY TERRIBLE I CAN'T DO IT AT ALL MINOR FLAW OR PRETTY CLOSE TO GET THAT THAT'S REALLY ALL 'M LOOKING FOR SOME MICE GOING SISTEM O ZRO ONE THREE ZERO IS LIKE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THIS EXERCISE CAUE YOU'RE AT A VERY HIGH ACUTE REST YOU MIGHT GET HER ON REP ONE TO MORROW NOVER ONE IK A SCORE OF ONE IS LIKE THERE'S A MINOR FLYW HERE WE CAN PROBABLY DO IT BUT WE NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS OF LOAD AND VOLUME HENOTHER ONE IS MAYBE IT'S PERFECT MAYBE IT'S NOT BUT GO AHEAD AND SO TO DO IT ON A REASONABLE PROTO CALL YOU'LD BE FINE I'M SO THAT'S GENERALLY WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS A COST FREE METHOD OF IDENTIFYING GOOD MOVEMENT TECHNIQUE WITHIN ANY THE THINGS THAT YOU WOULD DO WHAT ABOUT SPEED ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THIS IS ONE MOST PEOPLE SHOULD TEST IF YOU'RE HIGH PERFORMANCE OUTLY WE CAN RONT A FORTY AR DASH OR WE CAN DO I SOME DIFFERENT THINGS WITH A VELOCITY TRANSTUCEOR ON A BAR BELL IF YOUR WEIGHT LIFT OR SOMETHING FOR MOST PEOPLE PURE SPEED IS REALLY MAXIMUM VELOCITY OR ACCELERATION OR CON THE TWO WAYS WE BREAK IT DOWN IT'S NOT USTELLING NOT THAT NECESSARY O TEST WHAT ABOUT NUMBER THREE POWER WHICH I BELIEVE BEFORE YOU TOLD ME WAS SPEED TIMES FORSE SO THE REASON WHY I DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT SPEED IS BECAUSE YOU CAN INFER A LOT OF IT FROM Y POWER TEST AND A POWER TEST IS EASIER TO DO AS WELL AS EASIER TO TRAIN FOR FOR MOST PEOPLE SO THE THE COSTORY VERSION HERE IS A SIMPLE BROAD JUMP SO THIS IS STAND A WITH N NORMAL POSITION JUMP OUT AS FAR IN FRONT OF YOUS TO POSSIBWY CAN A MEASURE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN WERE YOU STARTED AND THE BACK OF YOUR HEEL WHERE IT LANDS A SUPERBASIC NUMBER TO LOOK FOR THERE IS YOUR HEIGHT SO YOU SHO BUILD A BROAD JUMP HOW TALL YOU ARE IF YOU'RE FIVE FOOT FIVE YOU SHULD AT FIVE FIVE SIX FOOT FIVE ET CETERA IT'S NOT PERFECT I'M THAT'S GOIN A RATC IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT FIFTEEN PER CENT FOR FEMALES THEY DISSIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE POWER IN GENERAL THAT MEN HAVEN'T SO YOU CAN WANT TO BRING THAT DOWN A LITTLE BIT BUT THAT'S A IS A VERY CRUDE NUMBER IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT LIKE A HIGH PERFORMAN AND A FELL PLAYER IF THERES SIX FEET TALL THERE CAN BE JUMPING LIKE NINE TO TAN TO ELEVEN FEET IF YOU CAN JUMP YOUR BODY HEIGHT IWELD NOT LOOK IN FOR OPTIMIZATION AND THIS PARTICULAR TEST WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR RED FLAGS IF YOU CAN JUMP YOUR BODY HEIGHT YOU'RE GONTO BE JUST FINE THAT'S INCREDIBLY STRAIGHT FORWARD AND YET I'VE ONE QUESTION YEP I'M ASSUMING THAT I CAN SQUAT DOWN AS LOW AS I NEED TO BEFORE I JUMP I CAN SWING MY ARMS FROM BACK TO FRONT AS HARDER WITH AS MUCH MORMENTUM I AS I CAN MUSTER AND WHEN I LAND YOU SAID I' MEN TO TAKE THE MEASURE FROM WHERE THE BACK MY HEELS YOU HAN A MEASURE THE DISTANCE YOU ACTUALLY COVERED SO DECLARIFY THERE'S NO RUNNING APPROACH HERE THERE'S NO A STEPS IN TO IT YOU'RE TA STAND AT A STIL YA YOU CAN SWING BOUNDS AS MUCH AS YOUD LIKE TO DO YOU GEN A PROJECTILE OFFS YOU CAN A MEASURE THE DISTANCE FROM THE TIPO YOUR TO SOBASELY STAND BEHIND THE LINE AND THEN THE FURTHEST POINT BACK WERE YOU LAND SO BASELY THE WORST POSSIBLE SCORE NOT THE BEST POSSIBLE I CAUS YOUR FEET WON'T LAND SYMMETRICALLY ONE'S PROBING IT TO BELITTE IT FOR OUR THER N NOW TECHNICALLY IF YOU FALL BACKWARDS IN YOUR HAND TOUCHES THE GROUND WE MARK THAT NUMBER BY IN THIS CASE JUST USE THE FURTHIST POINT BACK OF YOUR BACK YELL GO FROM THERE I'LL BE DRYING IT TO MORROW MORNING NOW IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO LITTLE BIT MORE TECHNOLOGY OR YU JUST REALLY WANT A KNO I BETTER NUMBER A A CLASSIC VERTICAL JUMP IT IS A GOOD STARTING PLACE SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO THIS IN A SIMPLE COSPHR WAY YOU CAN JUST MEASURE TO YOUR HANDS PUT THEM TO GETHER SO THAT BOTH OF YOUR A MIDDLE FINGERS ARE TOUCHING OVERLAP THEM AND PUT THEM DIRECTLY OVER YOUR HEAD AH AND YOU CONE ONL REACH UP AS HIGH AS YOU CAN GET AND YOU MARK THAT ON THE WALL MY BROTHER AND I USE TO DO THIS ALL THE TIME WE WOULD TAKE A A HIGH LIGHTER THE THE YELLOW ONES AND CULLOR AS MUCH AS WE CON ON OUR FINGER TIPS TOUCH THE WALL SO THAT THE HIGH LIGHTER WOULD STAYIN THE WALL IF YOU ACTUALLY GO BACK TO MY HOUSE FOR MY CHILDHOOD YOU'LL SEE THESE MARKERS ALL OVER OUR OUR HOUSE I'M SURE APPARENTS RTHRBY DAD DIDN'T CERE SINGLE THAT HE DIDN'T CARE IS THITS LIKE WHATEVER YOU GISE DONEORY ONE SO YOU WANT TA MEASURE THAT AND THEN OF COURSE YOU'RE GING TO JUMP WITH THOSE TWO HANDS AND TOUCH BESIDES YOU CAN UP AND YOU GT TA MEASUE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN YOUR STANDING REACH AND THE ACTUAL HEIGHTLY YOU JUMP THERE NOW THE REASON YOU'RE DOING IT TWO HANDED BY THE WAY IS BECAUSE IF YOU DO ONE HANDED YOU CAN ACTUALLY REACH PRETTY HIGH BY OFF SETTING YOUR SHOULDERS AND NOW YOU'RE GETTING INTO DIFFERENCES OF YOU KNOW WHO HAS MORE SHOULDER MOBILITY WHO HAS ABILITY TO CAN GET UP THERE A TWO FOOT STAND AR TWO HAND TO STANDARD APPROACH IS HERE IL SAME THING NO RUNNING APPROACH HERE YOU CAN DIP YOU CAN DRIVE YOU CAN AN DO ALL THOSE THINGS YOU CAN SWING YOUR ARMS BUT YOUREGINGTO BE A TWO HANDED TOUCH AS IT IS A GENERAL ITER DO THAT AND YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR A NUMBER OF SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY FOUR INCHES OR HIGHER IF IF YOU'RE PASS THE AGE OF FIFTY THAT NUMBER CAN COME DOWN A LITTLE BIT TO CLOSER TO TWENTY AND A GAIN FOR FEMALES IT'S CAN O BE RATCHEDE DOWN ABOUT FIFTEEN PER CENT EVERYRY OIN TO GO IF YOU'RE A A MIDDLE AGED FEMALE AND YOU'RE JUMPING TWENTY INCHES YOU'RE EUARE'N A PRETGEST SPOT I'M YOU GINGTO BE LOOKING REALLY NI SAIR SO NOW IF YOU CAN DO THAT ON A FORCE PLATE THAT'S EVEN BETTER SO THESE ARE VERY BASELY SCALES THAT WILL GO OUT TO MULTIPOLE DIDGES SOMETIMES FIVE TO NINE DIDGETS PASSES HEREROLL AND YOU UT STAND THESE THINGS YOU DO THEXACT SANTEST AND YHESE ARE VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE THY'LL TELL YOU NOT ONLY HOW HIGH YOU JUMP BUT THEY'LL TELL YOU HOW MUCH FORCE YOU PUT IN THE GROUND THEY CAN ALSO TELL YOU HOW LONG IT TOOK YOU THIS CWALL YOUR RATE OF FORCE DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS IMPULSE AND SPEED TO BUNCH OT OTHER STUFF WHICH ARE OUR IMPORTANT TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WERE ON THE POWER SPECTRUM YOU NEED TO BE SO YOU WOULD DO THAT IN ADDITION TO USING SOME SORT OF VELOCITY TRANSDUCER ON A BARBELL SO A VERY CLASSIC THING TO DO WOULD BE LET'S SAY YOUR GN TO DO A SQUAT AND YOUR GET TO PUT THIS A DEVICE ON THE BAR BELL AND YOU CAND THAT'S GINGTO MEASURE THE SPEED WHICH THE BARBELL MOVES AND YOU GET TO DO THAT AT FORTY PER CENT OF YOUR ONE REPETITION MACTS FIFTY PER CENT SIXTY PER CENT SEVENTY EIGHTY NINE YOU UP TO HUNDRED AND THAT ALLOWS YOU DE CREET WHAT'S CALLED A FORCE VELOCITY CURVE AND YOU CAN START TO SEE AT WHAT POINT WHEN YOU START LOADING THINGS HEAVY OU START SLOWING DOWN TOO MUCH AND THAT'LL TELL YOU WHAT PA T OF THE FORCE VELOCITY CURVE THAT YOU WANT A TRAININ TO OPTIMIZE YOUR POWER IWHY THT'S IMPORTANT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL DO THINGS LIKE WHEN I'M TRAING FOR POWER HOW HEAVY SHOULD I LEFT WEL THE GENERAL ANSWER PEOPLE SAY IS THIRTY PER CENT OF YOUR ONE RMAX BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT TRUE AT ALL WHAT'S MOST OPTMAL FOR POWER DEVELOPMENT WHICH WILL DISCUSS MORE MUCH LATER IS DEPENDING ON WHERE YOUR FLOD IN THE FORST PELOCITY CR SO IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO TECHNOLEGY LIKE THAT THAT CAN GIVE YOU LOT MOR INSIDE INFORMATION IF NOT DO THE BROAD JUMP TEST OR THE HIGHLIGHTER ON YOUR FINGER TIPS AND JUMP AT TUTS THE LALL TEST AT ANDY YELPANS I EY JIS YOU NONT COME ALONG AS ALREDY THE WALLS ARE ALREADY MEST UP JUST GO HAD COME UP TO WASHINGTON WILL DO IT PANTASTIC WHAT ABOUT STRENGTH RIGHT SO STRENGTH IS REALY IMPORTANT YOU NEED TO MEASURE THIS IN A IN MULTIPLAREAS AND WE'LL START OFF WITH GRIP STRENG GAPE SO YOU CAN DO THIS IN TWO WAYS I YOU CAN BUY A HAND GRIP DINAUMOMETER NOW THESE ARE ANYWHERE BETWEEN TWANTY TO A HUNDRED DOLLARS ANYWHERE THE DJACTUAL USED TO BE LIKE RISAN SCHOOL LIKE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS AND NOW YOU CAN LITTELY BUY THEM ON ANYWABSIDE FOR TWENTY FIVE BOXSO MY LAST RECOMMENDITION IS TECHNICALLY THAT'S NOT COSTHRY I KNOW YOUR WHOLE THING ABOUT THE COSPHRE PROTOCOS BUT TWENTY FIVE BOK SOME CALL IN THAT BASELY COSTERY I YOU CAN BRING THAT INA TESTAT AND AS THIT'S A LITTLE DEVICE WHERE YOU CAN SQUEEZE AND YOUR A D AND I WOULD DO YOUR RIGHT HAND AND YOUR LEFT HAN I YOU WANT A LOOK FOR A SYMMETERIES THERE BUT YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR SOMETHING LIKE TYPICALLY THOSE OR THREGIN TO GIVE YOU A VALUE IN KEYLOGRAMS AND A YOU WANT T LOOK FOR SOMETHING LIKE A MINIMUM SCORE HERE OF FORTY KEELOGRAMS IDEALLY YOU'RE OUP PAST SIXTY WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD SPOT TO BEAN IYOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO LESS THAN TEN PER CENT VARIATION BETWEEN YOUR LEFT AND RIGHT HAND YOU'RE YOU'RE NON DOMINANT HAND ACTUALLY SHOULDN'T BE THAT MUCH WEEKER AN NESTEST SO WHAT OU'LL ACTUALLY SY LOT OFTIMES AS TE NON DOMINANT CAN BE OFTEN TIME STRONGER I'M BECAUSE THE DOMINANT HAND IS MORE FOR MOVEMENT PRECISION WRITING THINGS LIKE THAT SO YOU WANT THEM TO BE CLOSE I IF YOU ARE A MALE AND YOUARE UNDER FORTY KULOGRAMS ON A HAND GRIPT INAEUMOMETER LIKE WERE WERK NEED TO TRAIN THAT IF YOU'R FEMALE IT'S NOT THAT MUCH LOWER BUT ABOUT THIRTY FIVE KILOGRAMS IS THE COT OFF POINT IIF YOU'RE ABOVE FIFTY FIVE WE CAN ADD A TREE TRAINING BUT I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT LEAVING IT OUT TO YOUR TRAINING IF YOUR FEMALE IF IT'S ABOUTE FIFTY THAT'S MY SORT OF CAT OFF  WERE WEON AGO SO THAT'S A FAIRLY CHEAP ONE ANOTHER ONETHAT YOU CAN NECTUL DO IS TIS A DEAD HANG SO YU CAN HOLD ON TO ANY BAR IDEALLY ONE THAT IS THIN ENOUGH TO WHERE YOU CAN WRAP YOUR WHOLE HAND AROUND IT SO YOU DON'T WANT TO BE USING A A GIANT FAT GRIP IM YOURE' HAVE A FALSE READIN HERE SO SOMETHING LIKE GOING TO THE GIM AND JUMPING ON ANY PULL UP BAR OR A PULL UP RACK YOU ANT A HANG AN THIS IS A SIMPLE TIME TEST SO IN GENERAL WE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANG FOR A MINIMUM OF THIRTY SECONDS AS WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR THIRTY TO KIND OF FIFTY SECONDS IS MY LIKE GOOD BUT WE COULD PROBABLY GET BETTER HERE IF YOU'RE CRUISAN ABOVE SIXTY SECONDS I'M GENERALLY PRETTY HAPPY I THIS SACTUALY Y A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHEN FEMALES TAND T O BE BETTER GRIPSTRENGTH AND WOMEN IS TENDS TO BE STRONGA THEY CAN HANG FOR QUITE A LONG TIME SO I' THEY'LL STILL STANDERS DON'T REALLY CHANGE THAT MUCH AFOR WOMEN NOW IF YOU ARE EXCEPTIONALY LARGE THIS THING DOESN'T SCALE PERFECTLY YE IF YOU'RE TWO HUNDRE FORTY POUNDS AND EVEN IF YOU'RE LEAN ITS JUST HARD THE TO HANG AND HOLD TWO ND OR FORTY POUNDS CONVERSELY IF YOU'R HUNDRED FORTY PID FIVE POUNDS EVEN IF YOU'RE UNHEALTHY YOU'RE GOIN TO BUILD TO HANG FOR LONG TIME THIT'S IS NOT THAT MUCH WAIGHT TO CARRY YO SO JUST ROUGH NUMBERS THAT'S TO START OFF WITH SO THAT'S GRIP STRAINGTS WHAT ABOUT STRENGTH ELSEWHERE IN THE BODY THE PRIMARY AS YUYOU CAN DO AN UPPER BODY STRANG TEST IF YOU ULD LIKE ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT TECHNICALLY SOMETHING WE DO VERY OFTEN HAPPY TO DO IT ONE I MAXPENCH PRESSER SOMETHING LIKE THAT THT'S GRIGHT I THE MORE ONT I'M GENERLLY MORE INTERESTED IN IS A LEG EXTENSION TEST AND THE REASON I LIKE THIS IS A BACK SQUAT IS BETTER A BARBLE BACK SQUAT IS LOOK THAT'S MY LIKE THAT'S MY JAM THAT'S MY LIFE RIGHT I'S THIS VERY TECHNICALLY DEMANDIN AND IT IT'S CHALLENGING YOU NED SPOTERS YOU NEED COMFER I A LOCKGOES INT THIS FOR SO FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON A LEG EXTENSION TEST IS FAIRLY STANDARDIZED YOU OT TO WORY ABOUT TECHNIQUE AND PEOPLE CAN JUST GET INTO IT AND GO AND SO WHAT YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR THERE IS IS A A COUPLE OF STANDARDS YOU WANT TA HIT A GAIN A VERY SIMPLE ANSWER HERE IS BODYWEIGHT CAN YOU DO A LEG EXTENSION WITH YOUR BODYWEGHT ONE REPETITION ONE REPETITION I CAN ANSWER THAT RIGHT NOW CAN YOU NO YOU CAN'T NO I CAN HAX SQUAT A REASONABLE MAN O WEIGHT BUT UN US ON THE LEG EXTENSION THIS MORNING AN NIGHT IS A NAUTILUS MACIE MACHINE AND I CERTAINLY COULD NOT LET I'LL TANTURE MY BODYWAY LEME NTE MCLAR FORY WERE YOU DOING A SINGLE LEG NO SO BILE OUT ER YOU CAN'T LEG SINCE YOU BODY WI KNOW WHAT I CERTAINLY CAN HAMSTERING COLONEL MY BODYWIGHT O C SO WE MAY WE HAVE SOME I'M DEFICIENCIESON ARE QUADS IT WE NED TO GO AFTER YO BUT THAT THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD NUMBER YOU WANT TO BE AT IF YOU GO UP AN AGE PAST EIGE FORTY EVERY DECADE THAT CAN COME DOWN ABOUT TEN PER CENT AND YOU'LL TILL BE IN A PRETTY GOOD SLOT SO IF YOU'RE FIFTY YEARS OLD AND YOU'RE A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY POUNDS IF YOU CAN DO ONE SIXTY YEAR AR PRETTY GOOD SIR A SPOT AND THEN YOU GO US AGAIN TAKE IT DOWN ABOUT TEN PER CENT EVERY DECATE AFTER FORTY BUT PRIOR TO FORTY THERE'S REALYI NO CHANGE IN STRENGTH I BUT CERTAINLY SOMEBODY IN THEIRE FORTIES TO FIFTIES SHOULD BE ABLIE TH LEG EXTENSION THEIR BODYWEIGHT NODID I LOOK FOR TO OUR DISCUSSION A BIT LATER I TALK O ABOUT HOW TO BUILD STRENGTH YET ANYTHES STRENGTH TES THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE DONE TO A TECHNICAL TRUE ONE RAT MAX YOU CAN USE WHAT ARE CALLED RE PETITION A CONVERSION AT QUATION SO BUT ON A LOAD THAT YOU THINK IS KIND OF CLOTHES TO YOUR MAXIMUM AND JUST DO IT FOR AS MANY RAPTS AS YOU CANT AS LONG AS IT'S UNDER FIVE RAPS TOTAL YOU CAN THEN ACTUALLY GO ON LINE AND ENTER THAT INTO ANY NUMBER OF CALCULATORS ANYWHERE AND IT WILL TELL YOU O CATE YOU DID THREE RE PETITIONS AT TWO HUNDRED POUNDS YOU'RE ONE REP MAX IS PROBABLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN WHATEVER SO THERE'S ESTIMATE EQUATION SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SPEND THE TIME ARE YOU NO T TRULY COMFORTABLE LIKE ABSOLUTELY GOING TO YOUR TRUE WHENE I MAX JUST GET TO A NUMBER THAT'S FAIRLY CLOSE AND DO AS MANY AS YOU CAN AND THEN GO ON A LINE AGAIN ONE RET MAX ESTIMATOR EQUATIONS ARE EVERYWHERE I'M IF YOU GET PAST FIVE REPETITIONS OR SO THE ACCURACY OF THOSE EQUATION STARTS GOING DOWN SO DON'T PUT ON SOMETHING A GOI DID TWELVE REPTS OF IT AND THEN TRY TO FIGERE OUT YOUR WONE RI MAX IT'LL GET CLOTES YOU START WOVING PAST THAT YOU JUST GETTING WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE ACCURACY SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE WHETHER YOU DOIN THE LEG EXTENSION TEST OR A FRONT SQUT TEST YOU DON'T TECHNICALLY HAVE TO DO AN ABSUTE ONE RAN MAX I'M IF NEITHER OF THOSE ARE ANOPTION ANOTHER ONE I LIKE A LOT HERE IT SIMPLY A FRONT SQUAT OR A GOBLA SQUAT HOLD SO YOU'RE TO HOLD TO WAIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR CHEST WHETHER A KETTLEBELLIS AS GRATED HERE A DUNBELL IS FINE HERE AND YOU WAN TO HOLD ABOUT HALF OF YOUR BODYWEIGHT GO ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM POSITION AND TRY TO HOLD THAT FOR ABOUT FORTY FIVE SECONDS SO IT IT'S A PRETTY GOOD INDICATOR OF I'M NUMBER ON YOUR POSITION IT'S HARD TO BE IN A BAD POSITION FOR THAT LONG AT THAT LOAD AS WELL AS CORE STRENGTH AND LOW BAXS TO BILLY SO IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT INDICATOR I'M THEN SAY THA LEGGY SENTIEN TEST BUT ITS IT'S A REALLY NICE ONE SO IT DOESN'T REQUIRE MANY MOVING PARTS IIT'S MORE DIFFICULT THAN LEG EXTENSION BUT IT'S IT'S QUITE A BIT MORE FUNCTIONAL AND IT'S CAN TOT GIVYON IN SIGHT INTO A LOT MORE AREAS THAN JUST THE QUATROSEPS SO FORTY FIVE SECONDS DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SQUAT YET AND THEN RETURNING TO A STANDING POSITION YET IN IF YOU CAN'T DO THE RETURN I ACTUALLY AT I'M NOT THAT WORRIED BUT AS LONG AS YOU CAN HOLD THAT GOOD POSITION WITHOUT A TECHNICAL BREAK DOWN IN THAT FORTY FIVE SECONDS THAT'S A REALLY GOOD SPOT I'M ASNAN INTRO I WANT A THIRD OF YOUR BODYWEIGHT FOR THIRTY SECONDS TRIFIC I PLANND TO ATTEMPT ALL OF THOSE STRENGTH TESTS VERY SOON WHAT ABOUT HYPERTROPHY SURE I'M ACTIAN BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT I WANT A JUMP BACKWARLY QUICKLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO ADD A COUPLE OF CAVIOTS TO THE STRENGTH TRENGTHS OF SO THERE'S TOO THAT I WANT NUMBER ONE THESE ARE ASSUMING YOU ARE A TECHNICALLY PROFICIEN SO I DON'T WNT YOU TO DO ANY EXERCISE TO EXHAUSTION OR TO MAXIMUM STRENGTH IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTAB WITH YOUR TECHNIC SO A JUST THESE ACCORDINGLY IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABL WITH THE FRONT SQUOT DO THE LEKE EXTENSION IF FOR I DIN'T COMFORTABWITH THAT DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT SO WE NEVER WANT TO UTILIZE MAXIMUM TESTING IF IT'S GOING TO COME WITHT E CONSEQUENCE A A SERE SECURE INTRY SO THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT FIE THE SECOND ONE IS YOU'RE WARM UP PROTOCALL WE'LL HAVE A HUGE A FACT ON YOUR ACTURAL RESULTS AND SO WHENEVER YOU DO THESE TEST ESPECIALLYIF YOU'REGONGTO DO A TEST ANDTHN I TEST AGAIN DOWN THE LINE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WARM UP PROTOCOL IS STANDARDIZE NOW AGAIN THE ENASE AND I CIN WE CAN I CAN GIVE YOU RESOURCES HAS SPECIFIC GUIDES FOR EXACTLY WHAT TO DO FOR YOUR WARM UP PROTOCOL PRIOR TO WONE I MAX TESTING SO WE CAN GO THERE AND YOU CAN LOOK THAT STNUFF UP WE CAN HAVE THAT TO SHON UTTOR SOMETHING YET I THINK IM WHEN WE GET INTO A DEEPER DISCUSSION ABOUT STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY AND RESISTANCE TRAINING IN GENERAL IF WE COU TOUCH INTO THE AT THE BEST WARM UP PROTICAL I KNOW I HAVE MINE AND I'M A CERTAIN IT'S CANN'T BE SUBOTIMLE BIS NOT EVERYTHING EVERY THAT'S HOW I'S NOT EVERY O CONVERSATION WEVE EVER HAD WHERE I LEARN ALL THE THINGS UNDERING IN CORECTLY BUT I DO MAKE CHANGES ON THE BASIS OF WHAT YOU TELL IT'S NOT IN CORRECTLY SO MUCH AS IT IS LIKE SUBOPTABLE THE THREE KIND WAY OF TELLING IT'S IN CORRECTO THANK YOU A WHAT ABOUT HY PERTURUE SO THERE THING YOU ANT T PAY ATTENTION TO HERE IS YOU HAVE THE ESTHETIC A PORTION OF HYPERTU THAT'S ENTIRELY UP TO YOU THERE IS NO RATIONAL YOU CAN DESIDE WHAT YOU FEEL LIKE LOOKS GOOD OR DOESN'T LOOK GOOD THAT'S IRRELEVANTTHERE IS A SUFFICIENT ABOUT YOU NEED TO HAVE WHERE BELOW THAT IS DETRIMENTAL TO YOUR HEALTH REGARDLESS OF YOUR OUT COMES AND SO THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS IS A COUPLE OF WAYS ANY SORT OF BODY COMPOSITION TEST IT  CAN DO THIS SO WHETHER THIS IS A A SCAN A THE LIKE A DECXS O SCAN WHICH IS A GOLD STANDARD OR OTHER A WAYS OF BIOLOGICAL A BIOLECTICAL IMPEDANCE OR OTHERWAYS SO THERE'S A TON OF DIFFERENT TEST YOUD GET THERARE PRETTY CLOSHE SO WHAT YOU WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHEN YOU GET LIKE A DEX O SCANT IS A NUMBER CALLED F F M I AND SO THAT SANDS FOR FAT FREE MASS AND DECKS SO YOU CAN LOOK AT AGAIN ANY NUMBER OF ON LINE CALCULATORS THESE ARE ALL STANDARD SO DOESN'T ACTUALLY MATTER WHEN YOU PULL HEM UP YOU' OFF TO WORRY ABOUT LOOKING UP AND WETHER NOT IT'S RIGHT OR NOT OR SOMETHING AND SO THAT'S AN ACTUALLY ELL YOU IF YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT MUSCLE MAT AND SO A NUMBER YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR IN GENERAL OF SOMETHING LIKE IF YOURE MAN YOU'RE F F AM I SHOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY OR HIHER IF YOU'RE WOMAN YOU WANTO LOOK FOR SOMETHING LIKE EIGHTEEN SO THAT THAT'S THE TARGETS IF YOU GET PASS LIKE TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE FOR A MAN THAT'S A LOT OF MUSCLE MASS ASSUMING YOUR REASONABLY LEAN NOW IF YOU'RE F OF EMI IS LIKE TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE BUT YOUR BODY FAT IS LIKE FORTY PER CENT YOU'RE ACTUIALY JUST A VERY VERY LARGE INDIVIDUAL YOU'RE NOT LIKE YOU'RE NOT N A GOING TO GRAY SPOT SO WHEN WE SAY THESE SORT OF NUMBERS IT SHE ASUMPTION THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY SUB THIRTY PER CENT BODY FAT FOR A MAN IN SUB THIRTY FIVE FOR A WOMAN SO THOSE THE NUMBERS  THERE ARE ON LIKE CALCULATORS ALL YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW IS YOU'R TOTAL BODY WEIGHT YOU'R BODY FAT PER CENTAGE AND THEN YOUR HEIGHT YOU CA ANSTER THOSE THREE NUMBERS AND THEN THEY'LL TELL YOU YOUR F IFA MI SCORING L CORRECT FOR ANADGUSTED VALUE THEN MOST THOSE WILL ACTUALLY TELL YOU THE GREETING RUBERIC IN THEM SI GOOD AVERAGE BAT ET CETERA BUT THOSE THE NUMBERS WE LOOK AT IF YOU ARE AS A MAN SUB SEVENTEEN AS A WOMANS SUB FIFTEEN NOWARE AN AREA OF OF PRETTY SEVERE PHYSIOLOGICAL DETRIMENT FOR INSUFFICIENT MUSCLE AND SOME OF OUR LATTER DISCANTION WILL TALK ABOUT WHY THAT MATTERS THAT'S NOT AM SUB SEVENTEEN PER CENT BODY FAT THITS IS SPECIFICALLY THE F F M AI THAT'S A CORRECT YET WHAT ABOUT MUSCULAR ENDURANCE IS THIS WREN TELL ME AN YOU DO WALSETS SO THIS IS REALLY NICE YOU CAN TO ANY NUMBER OF TESTS HERE A A STANDARD PLANK IT IS A GOOD TESTAMENT OF OF MUSCANDURANT SO CAN YOU HOLD A FRONT PLANK FOR SIXTY SECONDS CAN YOU HOLD A SIDE PLANK FOR FORTY FIVE SECONDS PRETTY EASY IF YOU'RE ABLE TO DO A PUSH UP SO IF YOU CAN'T THAT SORT OF TELLS YOU LONE IT'S ACTUALY INTERESTING IF YOU CAN'T DO A SINGLE PUSH UP THAT'S NOT A MUSCAN DURANCE IS YUE TONSECTUALY NOW STRENGTH AS YOU CAUSE IT'S A ONE OT MAX PROBLEM M SO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO FOR AGAIN FOR A GENERAL MALE WE SHOULD HAVE NO PROB DOING TWENTY FIVE PLUSS CONSECUTIVE PUSH UPS I APOLOGIZE FOR INTERRUPTING YOU BUT AS LONG AS WE'RE TIG ABOUT PUSHUPS JUST MENTION FORM ARE WE TALKING CHEST TOUCHING THE GROUND A ELBOWS BREAKING RIGHT ANGLES WHAT IS A PROPER PUSH UP ACCORDING TO YOU'RE LABORATORY UNLESS YOU AVE A VERY SPECIFIC REASON TO LIMIT RANGE OF MOTION I WANT ALL MY TESTING DONE THROUGH A FULL JOINT RANGE OF MOTION I THIS IS DIFFERENT FOR THE PERSON SO IT'S INDIVIDUALIZE TO THEM BUT IN GENERAL FOR A PUSH UP THIS WOULD BE A FULL COMPLETE LOCK OUT OF THE ELBOWS ON THE TOP AND A FULL CHEST TOUCH OR CLOSE TO IT AT THE GROUND YOU CAN DO IT DIFFERENT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER BUT JUST KEEP I STANDARD FROM YOUR PRETEST YOUR POSTEST IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MARK PROGRESS A BUT FOR US UNLESS WE HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC REASON WE'RE GOING FUL ARRANGE OF MOTION FOR ALL THESE TUS  SO TWENTY FIVE PUSH T WA FIRO MALES FOR A MALE IT IS A STANDARD AND EVEN SOMETHING LIKE TEN IS A NUMBER WERE LOOKING FOR AGAIN IS CON O MINIMUM CANTEGORIES I FOR AN UPPER BODY MUSTCER N DURANCS AND NOT TO GET TWO DOWN IN THE WEEDS BUT A I HAVE OBSERVED OTHER PEOPLE COURSE NUMMER MYSELF NOT I'M GITTING BUT OBSERVED OTHER PEOPLE PAUSING AT AM MAYBE AT REPETITION FIFTEEN CATCHING THEIR BREATH AND THEN CONTINUING OR YOU UM THAT MAN BE A SIY LIHET IS LIKE A LIKE A PISTON THAT WOULD BE A FAIL TO NO PAUSES CORRECT JUST UP DOWN UP DOWN AN TRYING TO GET  YET LEAST TEN BUT I DEALLY TWENTY FIVE I LEARNED THIS LESSON IN ONE OF OUR STUDIES I'L PROBABLY NINE YEARS AGO WER WE DIDN'T CLARIFY THAT AND SO WE ACTUALY HAD AN INDIVIDUAL HE WASN'T THEASNT HE WASN'T BEING A VARIOUS HE JUST FIGURED OUT IF I DO A COUPLE TAKE A QUICK BREAK INTO A CUP HE LIKE QUADROUPLE HIS POSTTEST RESULT FROM HIS PRETEST RESULT BECAUSE HE FIGURED OUT THAT LITTLE HACK SO YOU WANT A STANARDIZE IT IT'S NOT THAT I'M AGAINST OR HAVE SOME SORT OF STRONG BELIEF IT'S JUST TRYING TO KEEP POLITICAL STANDARDIZE AND WHICH MEANS ANY BREAK FELL TEST SO TEN TO TWENTY FIVE PUSH UPS MINIMUM FOR MALES WHAT A OUT FOR FO ELSE IFE A IF IT'S SUBTEN FOR A MAN THAT'S AGAIN IN YOU'RE LIKE VERY SEVERE RED FLAG PROBLEM  WE REALLY WE LIKE TO SEE A NUMBER ABOVE TWENTY FIVE LOOKIN THAT THAT'S WHERWERE ANCHOR ANYTHING BETEEN TWEEN TEN AND TWENTY FIVE IS LIKE E YE BUT NOT SEVERE IT MEANS THEY HAVE WORK TO DO WE HAVE WORK TO DOANIFER AND FOR FEMALES FOR I FEMALE YU A SKILL THAT SORT OF BACK SO A FEMALE THE ANSWER COULD BES LITTLE ZERO I SEE YOUGIN TO SEE THAT CAN YOU DO A FULL IPPOSITION IF THE'RE IN THAT POSITION WE'RE GENERALLY NOT GOING TO DO A MUSCAR N DURINSTEST FROM THE KNEES WE WEARE TO KNOW THE ANSWER IS YERES HERE I WE'LL ACTUALLY TO FALL TO ANOTHER TEST WIT I'LL TALK ABOUT IN A SECOND YERE SO FOR THOSE OF THOSE FOLKS ANYTH THAT'S IN A SKALEDOUN OIT RIGHT SO BASELY YOU LOOKING AT FIFTEEN IS THAT MARKER LIKE TWENTY FIVE ONS FOR THE MAL WHERE I WANT TO SEE ABOVE FIFTEEN AND IF I DO WORE GOOD ANYTHING BETWEEN FIVE TO FIFTEEN IS HA NUMBER OF LIKE O K UM IF YOUR SUB FIVE I WED WED GENERALLY HAVE SOME PROBLEMS AND IF THAT IS DIFFERENT BETWEEN ONE AND ZERO THAN I NOW WE ZERAS IS IS A PROBLEM SO WE SHOULD BIL TO DO THAT SO FSE FEMALE CAN NOT DO TEN FUL PUSHOPS YET TEN FOO PUSHIPS IS HARD FOR  A FEMALE DEPENDING ON SINS O CAY LOUT SAY A FEMALE CAN'T DO FIVE FUL PUSHOPS SYE SAID RATHER THAN GO TO AN KEESE DOWN VERSIONE WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO ASSESS THEIR MUSCULAR ENDURANCE AND WOULD YOU THEN ALSO ENCOURAGE THEM TO WORK ON THEIR STRENGTH WELL BUT ABSOLUTE SO AGAIN IF THEY CAN'T DO THEY CAN DO ANTHING LESS IN THREE I YOU RE O BE STRAING THE FACT IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT MUSCAR EN DURANCE IN GENERAL SO THIS IS A BIT OF A OFF TOPIC BEN A PROMISE ONL KEEP SHORT NOT COME RIGHT BACK WHEN I WAS A DOCTROR STUDENTI HAD A TWO LABMATES ONE OF EM WAS A RUNNER E FEMALE A  HUNDRED TWENTY POUNDS SOMETHIKE THAT SMALL EN THER ONE WAS A MALE AND HE WAS BAS LE LIKE A STRAIGHT PRO LIKE HE LIFTS AWEIGHTS THOUSAND DO ANY OTHERS FOR OF TRAINING T OES LIKE A VERY CLASSIC NOT TRAINING PROGRAME BUT CANNETRANE AND THEY WERE SORT OF BANTERING BACK AND FORTH FOR A WHILE AND BASECA SHE WAS SAYING YOU'RE SO UNFIT YOU CAN'T RUN AT ALL AND HE SAYING YOURE SO WEEK YOU CAN'T DO A PULLEP ADS THEY CHALLENGE EACH OTHER TO COMPETITION AS SAID AT THE END OF THE YEAR THE GURL IS GOING TO DO TWENTY SIX PULLOPS AND THE GUY HAD TO RUN A MARATHON SO TWENTY SIX MILES SO THAT WAS THE THING ANDTHEN THERE AS SOME SORT OF CONSEQUENCE FOR WHOEVER SCORTA FAILED TIL THE GUY QUICKLY TRY TO FIRGOT HOWD HL MI CAN RUN TWENTY SIX MILES WHEN I HAVE NOT RUN A MILE AND LIKE MANY MANY MANY YEARS SO WE JUST ARTED RUNNING YOU THREE MILES FOR MILES WHATEVER SHE WHAT COURSE THEY BOTH OF RANA MEATLY TO ME RIGHTN T SHE WAS LIKE HOW THEY HELL I CAN'T DO A PULLO AND I WAS LIKE GREAT AND I GAVE HER VERY SPECIFIC MAXIMOLL STRENGTH PROTO CALLAND SHE WAS LIKE WO I WANT TO GO TO THE ASSISTED PULLPT MACHINE AND WORK ON DOING LIKE SUTS A TWENTY FIVE AS I'VE GOT TO GET MY MUSCAR AN DURANCE UP AND I TRY TO EXPLAIN TO HER YOU'RE MUSCAY ENDURANCE IS OR RELEMANT IF YOU CAN'T DO ON IT'S NEVER GOING TO MATTER SHE DID THE MUSCURAN DURANCE PROTOCALL THE ENTIRE THING DIDN'T LISTEN TO ME THE END OF THE YEAR CAME SHE STILL PRODUCED EXACTLY ZERO PULLOPS SO POINT IS IF YOU LOOK AT MUSCAR ENDURANCE WHERE IS IT A STRENGTH AND WEARS AT ACTION MUSCAR EN DURANCE THE GENERAL SORT OF NUMBER THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS UNDER LIKE EIGHTY PER CENT I THAT'S GON TO TELL YOU AS THIS A MUSCAR N DURANCE PROBLEM OR IS AN OUP SO STRENGTH PROBLEM UNDER YE PER CENDED ONE RE PETITION  YE YET SO WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THIS IN FACT THI ACTULEAS IN YOUR QUESTION THE OTHER WAY TO AS SESS MUSCAR ENDURANCE IS TAKE THE EXACT STRENGTH TEST YOU DID FROM THE THE TALK FIVE MINUTES GO WHAT WHICH WHEN DID YOU DO LOD THAT TO SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT AND THEN DO THAT FOR AS MANY REPETITIONS AS YOU CAN AND THAT IS A TREMENDOUS BAROMETER OF MUSCAR AN DURANCE SO IF YOU WERE ABLE TO DO TWO HUNDRED POUNDS ON YOUR LEG EXSTENSION TESTS BUT SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT TAT AND Y THAT IS MANY RA YOU CAN YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR MORE THAN EIGHT REPETITIONS IF YOU ARE BELOW A REPETITIONS THEN WE HAVE A MUSCULAR ENDURANCE PROBLEM IF IT I IF IT IS HIGHER THAN THAT IF YOU GOT FIFTEEN OR TWENTY THEN WE KNOW WE HAVE PROBABLY SOME PROBLEMS AN YOUR PEAK STRENGTH OR THE TEST ITSELF SO THAT IS A GOOD EIGHT TO TWELVE SORT OF NUMBER IT IS WHERE YOU ANT TO BE LOOKING AT OT FOR TER WHAT ABOUT AN AROBIT CAPACITY THIS ONE'S MORE CHALLENGING YOEITHER HAVE TO GOTO LABORATORY AND DO SOMETHING LIKE A WINDGATE TESTS SO THIS IS A THIRTY SECOND MAXIMUL AM TEST WHERE YOU'R GOIN TO SEE HOW MUCH WORK CAN YOU POSSIBLY DO IN THAT THIRTY SECONDS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A LAD US AS TO LABORATORY YOU CAN YOU CAN DO THIS ON ANY ANY PROTOCALL YOU WANT YO THIS CUND BE SPRINTING THIS CAN BE ON AALIKE AN AIR BITE THIS COULD BE ON A ROWER ANYTHING LIKE THAT ANYTHING WHERE YOU CAN EXERT MAXIMA LEFFORT AND YOU DON'T AFETER WARD ABOUT TECONICAL PROBLEM SO I GENERALLY DON'T LIKE TO DO THINGS LIKE A CATTLE BELL SWING OR SOMETHING LIKE THATHERE JUST TWOMANY OTHER VARIABLES YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO GOES HARDEST YOU POSSIBLY CAN KNOWING YOU'RE GOING TO GET TO A PLACE OF TREMENDOUS FATIGUE NOW IN TA LAB WE OFTEN USE WAT CALLED A BOSCO PROTOCAL AND YOU'EGONG TO STAND IN A FORCE PLATE YOURE ONG TO DO AS MANY VERTICAL JUMPS AS FAST AS YOU CAN AS HIGH AS YOU CAN FOR SIXTY SECONDS AND YOURE ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED BY LIKE SECOND FORTY FIVE SO E EITHER USE THAT WHEN GET PROTOCAL OR THAT BOSCO PROTOCO IF YOU WANT THET AGAIN TAKE ANY O THOSE OTHER PLACES THIRTY SECONDS OR SO UP TO FORTY FIVE SECONDS UP TO MEN IF YOU ON IT DOESN'T RANLY MATTER AND YOU JUST MARK DOWN THE DISTANCE YOU COVER THAT'S ALL YOU WE DON'T REALLY HAVE STANDARD FOR THESE THINGS BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT HOW FAR YOU CAN TRAVELIN THIRTY SECONDS ON A TREADMELL IT IS IS CAN BE SO DIFFERENT THAN SPRINTING IN THE FIELD OR ON THE ASSAULT BIK OR WHATEVER SO A WHIL YOU REALLY WANT TO WORRY ABOUT THERE IS CAN YOU COMPLETE IT AND THEN HOW AWFUL DO YOU FEEL AFTERWARDS SO WHAT WHAT YOU REALLY WANT O THINK ABOUT HERE IS NOT THOSE PROTOCALS BUT THIS YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT CAN YOU GET CLOSE TO YOUR PREDICTED MAXIMUM HEARTRIGHT SO THE THE NUMBER WE THROUGHOUT IS TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MINUS YOUR AGE SO IF YOU'RE FIFTY YEARS OLD TWO TWENTY MINUST FIFTY YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET TO A MAXIMUM HEARTWRIHTER ROUND ONE SEVENTY BEASTS PERMENET NOW THAT NUMBER IS EXTREMELY GENERIC  IF YOU DON'T GET THERE THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY INDICATION OF YOUR BISINESS YOU GET HIGHER THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE ANY MORE FIT IT'S JUST A ROUGH NUMBER SO HERE'S WHAT I'M WHAT I WANT YOUTO DO IN THIS CASE YOUR HEARTRIGHT RECOVERY IS THE BETTER METRIC SO I WANT YOU TO GET UP TO A MAXIMUM HEARTRIGHT AND THEN TEST YOUR HEARTRAGHT RECOVERY AND WHAT YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR THERE IS ABOUT HALF A BEAT A RECOVERY PER SECOND SO YOU'RE GINGTO GET UP TO A PLACE WHERE YOU REACH LIKE ABSOLUTE TERRIBLE EXHAUSTION  MAXIMUM FATIGUE TEST YOUR HEARTRIGHT AND THEN COUNT RIGHT HAVE A TIME ER GOING WITHIN SIXTY SECONDS YOU SHOULD HAVE AGAIN AT HALF A BEAT PER SECOND YOU SHOULD HAVE A HARTRY RECOVERY OF THIRTY BEASTS PER MEN WITHIN THE NEXT THE NEXT MINUTE SO TO MIN RECOVERY T SHOULD BEGIN HALF THAT SO SIXTY BEATS THOSE ARE ROUGH NUMBERS TO GO BY AND YOUR THREE MENUTE RECOVERY IS AGAIN HALF ABHOUT AGAIN SO THAT IS THE CLOSEST WAY IF YOUR HARTRY RECOVERY IS WORSE THAN THAT THEN WE KNOW WE HAVE A PROBLEM IN YOUR ANOROBA CAPACITY OR YOURE CARNIVASCOPASSY LOV IT WHAT ABOUT NUMBER EIGHT MAXIMOL HEART RATE BEU'S WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBE SONES A LOT LIKE MAXIMAL HARTR I THIS IS YOUR VIEW TO MAX SO THE GOALD STANDARD HERE IS TO ACTUALLY GO INTO A LABORATORY AND GET THIS THING DONE SO WE CAN ACT YOUR RUN OF AVIL TO MAX TESS WHERE YOU PUT A MASS ON CLOCKED ALL YOUR GASES AND RUN YOU TO THERE AND THERE'S A VERY SPECIFIC PROTO CALL FOR A COMPLETION OF A A TRUE MAXIMUM TEST AND IS SCIENTIST WILL KNOW THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT YOU CAN DO A COPPLE OF TEST ONE OF EM IS CALLED A TWELVE MINUTE COOPERS TEST SO THIS IS SIMPLY TIME YOU CAN A RUN FOR TWELVE MINUTES AS FAR AS YOU CAN AND YOU CAN RECORD THE DISTANCE YOU COVERED AGAIN YOU CAN GO ON LINE TO ANY A ANY NUMBER OF OF CALCULATORS ENTER THT DISTANCE IN AND THAT WILL TELL YOU YOUR PROXIMU IR ESTIMATE OVEAL TO MAX SO THAT'S A TWELVE MINUTE SPRINT TWELVE MINUTES RENT MAXIMUM DISTANCE YOU CAN COVER IN TWELVE MINUTES KEEPING A STEADY PACE THE WHOLE TIME OR GO WHAT EVERYU WANT THE GOAL IS TO GET MAXIMUM DIF DISCOVERED IN TWELVE MINUTES SO THAT'S ANYWHERE BETWEEN A MILE TO TWO PLUSS MILES E BAYING O HALF IT YOU ARE BUT YOU JUST DO THAT COOP FOR TWELVE MINUTE TEST GOT IT I TOLD YOU  SO IF YOU REMEMBER IT A ROBE OF CAPACITY IS EIGHT TO TWELVE SORT OF MINUTES WHERE YOU'RE GIN TO SEE A REAL TRUE TEST OF THAT VEAL TO MAX YOU SIMPLY CAN'T GET THAT I'M IN UNDER A FEW MINUTES SO IT IS IT IS A THET IF YOU WANT YOU CAN DO A LITTLE GENTLER VERSION OF THAT IM SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SUB MAXIMAL TESS THERE IN FACT THERE IS A ONE MILE LOCK TEST YOU CAN DO SO AGAIN ALL YOURE GOING TO DO IS IN THIS CASE YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF EITHER A STOP WATCH OR IDEALLY HART RA MONTER AN ALL YOU HAVE TO DO AS IS IS A ROCK FOR ONE MILE SOME MAXIMAL TEST IS YOU CAN A WALK A MILE RECORD THE TIME RECORD YOUR HART RATE AT THE END ENTER THOSE IN AND THOSE WILD GIVE YOU AGAN ESTIMATES OF REBUSE TO MAX SO THAT'S THE LIKE O MY GOSH I CAN'T RUN FOR TWELVE MINUTES AS HARD AS I POSS WE CAN OR AN WANT TO DO IT OR I WE HAVE A LOT OF HES UM IN OUR EXECUTIVE PROGRAMM A SEC MY KNEE HURTS TO BAD I'VE GOT BACK PAIN WHEN I RUN WHATEVER CAN I OOK AND YOU DO WALK TIS AND IT'S PRETTY ACCURATE IF YOU DO A CORRACTLY SO TECHNICALLY ALL YOU HAVE CACT TO DO IS MEASURE YOUR HEART RATE ON YOUR YOUN NO CAN COUNT SIXTY SECONDS BUT ITS IS EASIER TO WORK WITH EVERYONE'S WATCHES AND STUFF NOW TOS SWEARE TO HART RY MONITR PLUG IN THOSE NUMBERS IM AT AGAIN THOSE ARE ALL STANDARD A CALCULATIONS SO ANYWHERE YOU FIND THOSE I YOU OUGHT TO WORRY ABOUT THE SOURCE SO YOU JUST ENTER YOUR STUFF FIN IN THERE CUN BE RUNNIN OUT THE SAME OCCASIONI LIKE THE ID OF THE TWELVE MINUTE RUN I MANY GIVE IT A SHOT SOIT FOR FOR YEARS WE DO TO ONE MILE VERSION OF THIS AND O THIS IS A LOT MORE SCIENCE ON THE CUPETOMI COULD PROTEST SO WE DID THAT IT IS PRETTY GOOD AND IT IS NOT EVEN REMOTELY CLOSE TO FINE IT SOUNDS LIKE FUN FOR OTHER REASONS YE WELL IT IS IT IT WERE FUN IN THE SENSE THAT IT REVEALS A LOT YET POWERFUL POTENT SUPER THERE'S NO HIDING YOU CAN HIDE WITH A LEGGI CENTEN TEST IT DOESN'T HURT THAT PAT BUT YOU YOU CAN NOT FEEL ANYTHING BUT THE TWELVE MINUTE RUN AS FAR AS YOU CAN TEST SO THESE ARE REALLY ACTUALLY SI PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSTIC TEST ARE OF SOURCUR NUMBER NINE LONG DURATION STEADY STATE YET EXERCISE I THINK OF THIS AS A CA ENDURANCE BUT AS YOU MENTION BEFORE THERE ARE OTHER FORMS OF ENDURANCE SO LONDRATION STEADY STATE EXERCISE YET SO YOU REALLY WANT A THINK ABOUT THIS AS NOT A STANDARD NUMBER THIS IS YOU SHOULD MAINTAIN CONSISTENT WORK OUT PUT FOR OVER TWENTY PLUSSMENITES E AND THIS ONE I WANT YOU TO DISPICK SOMETHING THAT IT WAS IN YOUR LIFESTAL SO IS THERE A LOOP AROUND YOUR HOUSE THAT YOU CAN DO IS THERE SOME PROTO CALL THAT YOU YOU LIKE TO USE IT FOR AND YOU'RE SIMPLY GOING TO TEST YOUR ABILITY CAN YOU MAINTAIN WORK WITHOUT STOPPING THAT'S ALL IT NEEDS TO BE NOW IDEALLY I PERSONLY LIKE TO THROW LITTLE TWISTIN HERE WHICH IS CAN YOU DO THIS WITH NASAL BREATHING ONLY THAT'S WHAT I FEEL REALLY GOOD IF YOU CAN GO THIRTY STRAIGHT MINUTES WITHOUT NEEDING TO TAKE A BREAK I'M WALKING DOESN'T REALLY CUT I UNLESS YOU'RE VERY VERY UNFIT IN WHICH CASE IF WAKING THIRTY MINUTES WITHOUT A BREAK IS A CHALLENGE OKE I THERE BUT IF YOU CAN I WANT YOU MOVING AT A NON WALKING PACE I DON'T CARE WHAT ZONE THIS IS TO THREE FOUR OR FIVE I DON'T CARE SHONLY YOU CAN MAINTAIN MINIMUM OF TWENTY MINUTES OF WORK WITH NO BREAKS NO INTERVALIS NO DOWNTIME AND I GAN IDEALLY BREATHING THOUGH YOUR NOSE ONLY I LOVE THIS LIST BUT IT WORRIES ME A BIT NOT BECAUSE ANY ONE OF THESE TESTS IS NECESSARILY THAT OVERWHELMING BUT BECAUSE I'M UNCLEAR ABOUT HOW TO ARRANGE PERFORMANCE OF THESE DIFFERENT TESTS FOR INSTANCE DO I SEPARATE THEM SO I'M DOING ONE TAST LIKE LONG DURATION OUT PUT ON ONE DAY AND I'M DOING STRENGTH ON ANOTHER DAY THOSE SEEM PRETTY OBVIOUS TO ME BUT ARTHER ONCES THAT ONE CAN COMBINE ON DIFFERENT DAYS HOW MUCH TIME SHOULD ONE GIVE ONESELF IN BETWEEN THESE TESTS AND HOW OFTEN SHOULD ONE DO IN ASSASSIMENT JUST AS WE DON'T WANT IN TE SARILYES VALUATE BODYAT CHANGES BY GETTING ON THE SCALE THREE TIMES TO DAY M ONCE A DAY AT THE SAME TIME EACH DAY IS MORE PRACTICAL HOW OFTEN SHOULD WE BE ASSESSING OUR FITNESS FOR EACH IN EVERY ONE OF THESE WELL THE WAY THAT I WOULD SAY THIS IS YOU WANT TO PICK THE ONE THAT IS THE WORST AND DO THAT MORE QUICKLY SO IF FOR EXAMPLE YOU DO THE UPPER BODY STRENGTH TEST AND YOU ARE FANTASTIC IF YOU CAN BENCH REST DOUBLE YOUR BODYWY T I DON'T NEED TO TEST YOUR BENCH VERY OFTEN FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON NOT A POWER AFTER BUT MAYBE ONCE A YEAROR MAY BE NOT EVEN THAT WE JUST DON'T NEU O GET THERE HOWEVER IF WE THEN TEST YOUR YOUR VIEW OF TWO MAX AND IN YOUR TWELVE MINUTES YOU COVER A TOTAL OF A HALF A MILE THEN LIKE WE MIGHT WONT TO TEST THAT EVERY MONTH AND SO WE'RE GOT TO LET OUR PRIORITIES EMPHASIZE WHICH ONE WE'RE GOING TO DO MAR OFTEN I WOULD RECOMMEND DOING THIS FULL BATTERY ONCE A YEAR FOL BATTER YO MEAN THE ENTIRELIST ON ONE THEENTIRE NOT  ONE DAY BUT WITHIN A WEEK SO YOU COULD TAKE A WEEK NOW YOU COULD DO THESE TACHNICALLY ALL IN TWO DAYS A THREE DAYS SPLIT HERE IT IS PROBABLY BEST SO IF YOU WERE TO DIS A HAY THIS IS LIKE TESTING WEEK ACTUALLY LOVE THIS FOR BEGINNING IN THE YEAR I WHATEVER IT IS A YOU SORT OF CHANGE YOUR TRAINING BUTI THINK IT ONCE A YEAR JUST LIKE ONCE A YEAR YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GO TO A PHYSICIAN AND GET FULL BLOOD WORK I A FULL O HEART SCAN AND IN EVERYTHING LIKE THAT I AND THEN IF MAYBEYOU HAD HEARTISHOTHER COME BACK IN ATTEST YOU OR FREQUENTLY WHATEVER THE CASEIS RIGHT YOU SHOULD PROBABLY RUN THROUGH THIS AND YOU'REGOING TO BE THINKING THE ABBIT I DON'T WANT TA I GIVE UP ON MY EXERCISORE TING THAT WEEK WELL I PROMISE YOU YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FINISH THIS WEEK AND THINK I DIDN'T DO VERY MUCH WORK THIS WEEK IT'S IT'S GET TA FEELD GREAT AND THEN YOU'RECON HAVE A VERY NICE BAROMETER OF EXACTLY WHERE YOU NEED TO CHANGE AND AND PRIOR TOI YOUR TRAINING FOR THE NEXT QUARTER HALF A YEAR OR WHEREVER WOU WANT TO GO IF YOU WANT ACT TOU DO THIS EVERY SIX MONTH THAT'S REA WE MAND O BAC YOU DOIN THIS QUITE NO THING LIKE MORE LIKE EVERY SIX MONTHS AS A GENERAL I TEST THAT'S A REALLY GOOD WAY TO DO BUT IF IF MINIMUM IF YOURE ARGUNEG WITH ME GIVE ME ONCE A YEAR YOU ON'T DO THIS SO WHICH ORDER TO DO THEM AN THE NON FATIGUING TEST YOU CAN DO WHENEVER SO THIS IS THE THE BODY COMPOSITION SCAN THE EFFIF AND MY THE BODY FAT COMPOSITION ALL THIS SUFF CAN BE DONE WEVER I GENERALLY LIKE TO DO THAT THOUGH AS YOU'R VERY FIRST ECTIVITY THE REASON IS WE KNOW THAT A CUE D EXERCISE CAN HEAVILY INFLUOUS THINGS LIKE BODY COMPOSITION MEASUREMENTS BECAUSE OF INFUL INFLAMMATION WATER STORE TO CETRA SO IT'S EASIEST O DIST SORT OF GET THAT OFF OF A FORTYEIGHT HOUR REST YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T DO ANY HARD EXERCISE THE DAY BEFORE A BODY COMPOSITION TEST AND PROBABLY FORTYEIGHT HOURS BEFORE THAT SO JUST START YOURSELF OFF FOR THAT YOUR MOVEMENT TEST CAN BE THE SAME THING I YOU DON'T WANT TO TRY TO DO A A SESSIMENT OF HOW WELL YOU'R SQUATTING IF YOU'RE INCREDIBLY SORE FROM YOUR YOUR BRUTAL SQUINE TU SO TEN TO DO THOSE THINGS WHEN YOU'RE THE MOST FRESH THEN WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS ANY SKILL OR MAXIMUM STRENGTH OR POWER GOES AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE DAY ANY FATIGUING THING HAPPENS AT THE END AND SO YOU COULD EASILY DO THIS ALL RIGHT I'M GOING TO DO MY POWER TEST MY BROAD JUM GRIGHT YOU'RE NOT CAN BE FATIGUED AT ALL FROM THAT AND ON THE SAME DAY SINCE I'M ALREADY PRETTY WARM DUP NOW MIN A ROLL RIGHT INTO MY LEG STRENGTH TEST AND SINCE I'M REALLY WARMED UP I'M GOING TO DO MY LEG MUSCULAR AN DURN SESS RIGHT THERE SICE IS A VERY COMONSTRATAGYOU WE USE WOULD DO OUR ONE R AT MAX LEG EXTENSION FIVE MINUTES SEVEN MINUTES WHATER WE NEED TO DO COME BACK LOATI TO SEVENTY FIVE PER AND DO AS MANY RAPS AS YOU CAN WEL YOU CULD ROLL RIGHT INTO THEN YOUR UPPER BODY TEST OR YOUR GRIP STRAENGTH TEST OR ANYTHING ELSE A YOU WANHT TO DO THERE I IS THERE A LITTLE BIT OF INFLUENCE YE BUT REALLY FOR MOST PEOPLE IT'S NOT THT BAD A WHAT  INFLUICE I MEAN IF YOU DO A LEG STRINGTH TEST COMING BACK ON DOING AN OPPER BODY STRENGTH TEST AFTERWARDS IT'S NOT THAT BIG ADEAL GIVE YOURSELF FIFTEEN YOU'RSELF TWENTY MENTS KEEP PLENTY TIME SO OU CAN NOCK OUT YOUR STRANGTH TESTING IN RASCONRNDRANCE TESTING ALL IN ONE DAY THAT COULD BE YOU COULD DO YOUR PERFORMANCE I YOU'R SKILL DIGNOSTIC YOURE POWER JUMP TEST YOUR STRENGTH AND YOUR MUSCAN DURANCE AND ALL THAT SUFFIS KNOCKED OUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME BACK ON A SEPARATE DAY AND DO YOUR ANEROBIC TEST THIS IS THIRTY SECONDS MAXIMONDURANCE THINGS LIKE THAT YOU COULD THOUGH IF YOU WANTED DO THAT AFTER YOU'RE LONG DURATION TEST YOU LONGGURATION TEST AS GAND AS IS CAN A FUNCTION AS LIKE A I BE WARM UP OR YOU CULD LOOT THOSE THINGS OR YOU DO THEM ON SEPARATE DAYS YOUE GOING TO HAVE TO DO YOUR VEAL TO MAXTESTS ON ITS OWN DAY FOR THE MOST PART UNLESS YOU WANTED TO DO AGAIN YOUR MOVEMENT OR YOUR BODY COMPOSITION SORT OF BEFORE THOSE THINGS IM SO YOU REALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO KIND OF MIX AND MATCH IDEALLY THIS MOST REALISTICALLY PROBALY TAKES THREE DAYS IF YOU ANT TO SEPARATE THEM INTO FOUR OR FIVE THE MORE SEPARATION YOU DO THE BETTER DAYTER YOU I GET IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF LIKE HOW HOW PEDANTIC ARE YOU REALLY TRYING TO GET HERE AND ARE YOU WILLING TO LOSE FIVE PER CENT TO THEN SAYE THE WHOLE DAY THEN YOU CAN DO SORT OF THINGS AND MULTIPLE STACKS SO THAT'S THAT'S HOW I WOULD BREAK UP SO WHAT I'M HEARING IS BETTER TO DO IT THAN TO NOT DO IT MOST DEFINILE AND BE RATIONAL DON TO A DON'T TRY AND DO YOUR STRENGTH OUTPUT LATE IN THE DAY WHEN YOUR FATIGUED YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO COMBINE WITH SOME OF THE IMSTEADY STATEEN DURANCE IN A MAXIMAL HEART RATE FINE UNDERSTAND THERE MAY BE A SLIGHT DEFIS IT THERE BUT TESTED THE SAME WAY EACH TIME IN WHAT YOU REALLY LOOKIN FOR IS IMPROVEMENT YET AND YOU CAN ALSO DO THE HARTRAY RECOVERY UNDER ANY A OUTIC SO YO COU O THE HARTRIGHT RECOVERY I'M AFTER YOU VEAL TO MAX AS WELL SO YOU FINISH THAT THING AND THEN JUST NA AGAINTO THE SAME TEST FOR UP TOE THREE MENTHS THESE AR FANTASTIC TOOOLS I'M ALMOST THEMPTED TO SAY THAT I'M WILLING TO POST MY NUMBERS BUT THAT ACTUALLY VIOLATES THE O QOOR PRINCIPL THI THINK WE'RE GETTING OUT HERE WHICH IS THAT IT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT ANYBODY IS GOING TO BE PHENOMINAL ACROSS THE BOARD AM IN CERTAINLY THERE WILL BE INDIVIDUALS THAT AR BUT BASE ON EVERYTHING WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER SPECIFICITY OF TRAINING AND IM HOW EXTENSIVELY SOMEBODY'S BEEN TRAINING A CERTAIN WAY WILL WITHOUT QUESTION LOPSIDE THEM IF YOU WILL YET TOWARD BEING BETTER IN SOME OF THESE ASSASTIMENTS AND LESS GOOD IN OTHERS AND THAT'S JUST SIMPLY THE WAY THAT THESE ADAPTATIONS WORK YET AND IT'S NOT YOU DON'T NEED TO BE OPTIMAL IN ALL THESE AREAS KTO BE QUOTICO OPTIMAL HEALTH FROM THIS PERSPECTIV YU JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE AGAIN THERE'S NO SEVERE PER FORMANCE ANCORS S WHAT WE CALL THEM RIGHT THE WE WON'T WANT ANYO THESE SEVERE CONSTRAINTS CAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO GET LIMITED BY THAT THING AND SO YOU WANT TO DO AS MOVE THAT UP TO JUST SUFFICIENT OR CONCERNING AND GET IT AWAY FROM THAT IF YOU DO THAT THAT THINGS I CAN CATCH YOU YOU CAN BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PUSUE PURSUE OPTIMIZATION AN ANY THE ONE THINGS T AT OU HAVE A SPECIFIC PASSION FOR WHICH IS GENLY WHAT MOVES PEOPLE RIGHT YOU YOU TRAIN IM SO YOU FEEL BETTER YOU TRAIN BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEREARE ALL THESE BENEFITS TO IT AND IN JESE THIS AUDIENCE PROBABLY COULD LIST HUNDREDS OF THEM BUT YOU ALSO TRAIN BECAUSE YOU GENERALLY LIKE TO GET BETTER AT SOMETHING A LOT OF US THAT HAVE SOMETHING AND SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THATYOU'RE NOT GONE HAV I KNOW YOU'R GOODT ENDURANCE BUT YOU RELLY SHOULDN TRAININ MORE WE DON'T WANT THAT MESSAGE NOT AT ALL I WANT YOU TO LOVE YOUR TRAINING WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT LOVING THAT SO MUCH THAT YOU'RE NOT TAKING SOME BLINDERS OFF AND MISSING ANOTHER AREA WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY AGAIN YU PULL THAT PERFORMANCE HINKER THIS WHOLE SHIP SAILS FASTER WITH LESS EFFORT AND LESS FRICTION WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS IS ALSO THAT AS YOU'VE DESCRIBED IT IT'S NOT JUST FOR ATHLETES OR PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPERINTO FITNESS IT'S ALSO FOR PEOPLE THAT JUST WANT TO BE HEALTHY AND WANT ESTHETIC CHANGES AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE EXERCISE IN WHICH I THINK ATCOUNTS FOR PREALY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE OUT THERE SO AND I THINK OF WHAT YOU DESCRIBED IS IT INCREDIBLY WELL STRUCTURED INCREDIBLY CLEAR AND INCREDIBLY ACTIONABLE SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT I SERIOUS ABOUT MY WILLINGNESS TO DO THIS AND  AT LEAST SHARE THOSE NUMBERS WITH YOU AND I THINK FOR MOST PEOPLE THAT ARE SEEKING WHAT YOU LISTED OX BEFORE ESTHETIC CHANGES FUNCTIONALITY IN LONGEVITY IT'S CLEAR THAT ALL NINE OF THESE ARE GOING TO BE IMPORTANT IN SOMEMER ARTOR ANOTHER SO BEFORE WE CLOSE OUT I WANT TO GO BACK AND FINISH OFF THE METRICS FOR EVEAL TWO MAXCS AND ON'T ACTUALLY THINK I GAVE YOU NUMBERS ON THAT SO IN GENERAL FOR MEN A MINIMUM NUMBER WE WANT TO LOOK AUT HERE IS THIRTY FIVE MILL LEADERS PER CULOGRAM PER MENUTE AND FOR WOMEN THAT BE ABOUT THIRTY SO WEWE CAN ACTUALLY PUSH AA LOT HIGHER ON THOSE THINGS IN REALITY I WANT TO SEE MEN ABOVE FIFTY IF I COULD JUST INTERRUPT YOU FOR A SECOND WHEN YOU SAY FORTY MILLIERS PER KILEGRAM MILLIERS OF WHAT SPECIFICALLY YES SO WHAT ACTUO THOSE METRICS MEAN IS  THE FIRST ONE MILL LEADERS IS OXYGEN SUCH A MOUNT OF OXYGEN KILOGRAMS IS BODY WEIGHT SO IT'S HOW MUCH OEN CAN YOU BRING IN PER KILEGRAM OF BODYWAY PER MINUTE SO IS A VOLUME OF OXYGEN PER YOUR SIZE IN A TIME DURATION IN FACT THE WAY THAT YOU CALCULATED I IS YOU MULTIPLY YOUR CARDIA CALPET BY WHATS TELD YOUR AVIO TWO DIFFERENCE YOUR CARRIA CALPUT IS YOUR HEART RATE TIMES YOUR STROKE VOLUME SO HOW MUCH A BLOOD YOU'R PUMPING OUT PER PUMP AS YOUR STROKE VOLUME HOW MANY TIMES YOUR PUMPING OR YOU'R BEATING YOU MULTIPLY THAT BY YOUR AVIO TWO DIFFERENCE YOU VE O TWO DIFFERENCE IS ARERY MINE IS VAIN DIFFERENCE SO THE MOUNT OF OXYIEN IN YOUR ARTERIES MINE IS THE AMOUNT OF OXTION YOUR VAIN WHICH IS GOING TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH YOU TOOK UP IN YOUR CAPILARIES IN YOUR MUSCLES SO YOU TAKE THOSE TWO FACTORS MOLTIPIME TO GATHER AND THERE'S OUR VIEW TWO MACTS YOU KNOAS YOU WERE DESCRIBING THAT I IMAGINE YOU GETTING TO AN EFIMORI MACHINE AND SEEING THAT EQUASION LIGHTING UP IN YOUR BRAIN CAUSE CLEARLY IT'S COMMITTED TO MEMORY VERY WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT  CLEAR DESCRIPTION YET SO TO FINISH THOSE NUMBERS I I REALLY TRULY WANT TO SEE SOME A MAN ABOVE FIFTY N I'M NOT EVEN REALLY STOKED UNTIL I GET ABOVE FIFTY FIVE IN FCT IT'S SORT OF FUNNY DAVE COSTELL WHOSE LAB I DID MY PAGE DAND HE WAS RETIRED BY THE TIME BUT HE HE'S AGAIN WHAT HE'S LEGENDARY FIGURES AN EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY I'M STARTED IN THE SEVENTIES HE WOULD ALWAYS SAY THERE'S NO HUMAN EXCUSE TO BE BELOWE SIXTY WHICH I ALWAYS ALWAYS LIKE DAMN L THAT'S REALLY ACTUALLY PRETTY HARD TO GET TO IF YE BUT WAS HE OH YES DEAR E NOW HE STILL ACTUALLY SETTING WORLD RECORDS LIKE IN THESE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND IS LIKE ALL THE MASTER'S RECORDS FOR SWIMMING AND ENCYCLING IS SOME SO HE WAS A SUPERSUPERFIT GUY I SO HE WAS ALWAYS ABOVE SIXT E'S PROBABLY LIKE FIFTY SOMETHING NOW EVEN OGH HE'S NOW EIGHTY OR WHATEVER EIGHT YEARS OLL YEAR WITH F THE O TWO ACTS OF FIFTE'S PROBAB REALLY NOT FIFTY'S PROBABLY BUT HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO MEMBER THAT EARLIER IN THE WE TALKED ABOUT I HAVE THE NINETY TWO YEAR OLD BY THE VIEW TWO MAXT OF THIRTY IGHT THEY'S PROBING TO BREAK THAT RECORD WHEN HE GETS THERE I'M SURE I'M S I GAN IN FACT I GIRIN TO YOU HE HAS THAT NUMBER IN HIS BRAIN IHAVE A TALKED HIM IN FIFTEEN YEARS BUT I GUARANTEE THAT NUMBER IS IN HIS BRAIN AND HE'S PROABLY TRAINING FOR IT I LOVE IT AND I LOVE IT BECAUSE IT PROVES THAT EXERCISE PAYS OFF OH YET IT'S ONE OF THE FEW THINGS IN LIFE WHERE THE'S A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WORK AND OUTCOME YET THAT'S AS HENRY RAWLINS DESCRIBED IN HIS WONDERFUL ESSAY IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT OH MY GOST OR YOU'RE PUNKROCK I YOU KNOW HENRY AMSURE I MAT I CERTAINLY KNOW WHO HE IS AND IAW HIS HE HAS WORK AN INCREDIBLE ONE PAGE A PAPER SORT OF SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE IRON ANY BASELE DESCRIBES THAT AS LIKE THIS IS THE ONE THING WHERE IT'S TRUTH IT IS THE MOST TRUE THING YOU'LL EVER DO I WHICH IS Y LOVE FOR THAT IM IT'S ALMOST LIKE A PRINCIPLE OF NATURE HON ER PERSENT YET SO WITH WITH THE WOMEN I REALLY WANT TO SEE THE WOMEN IF I WANT TO SEE MEN ABOVE FIFTY FIVE I REALLY WANT SE WHON ABOVE FIFTY IAS THE TARGET IN IF YOU LIKE YOU'R THERE I'M PRETTY GOODS SO YOU CAN DO THE MATH ON THEN THE MIDDLE GROUND OF WHAT'S LIKE O K BUT WE NEED O WORK ON IT IN FACT IF YOU LOOK ACROSS THE LITERATURE I DIFFERENT ATHLETES YOU'REGOING TO SEE LIKE THE THE REALLY HIGH LEVEL ENDURANCE FOLKS  YOU THEY MAY PAST SEVENTY OR EIGHTY IN FACT IM THERE WAS TALK A FEW YEARS AGO F O GUY BREAKING A HUNDRED A I'S LIKE AN EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN YEAR OLD BUT I ACTIO DON'T THINK WAS EVER FULLY CONFIRMED REPEATED BUT CERTAINLY YOU'LL SEE PLENTY OF PEOPLE LIKE NINETY FIVE IM IN THOSE EXTREMES IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER SPORTS LIKE FOOTBALL OR BASKETBALL THERE PROBABLY GOING TO BE IN THE FIFTY FIVE SIXTY FIVE SORT A RAIN SO IF YOU IS AN AVERAGE PERSON OR FIFTY FIVE I THAT'S A REALLY GOOD MARKER TO BE IN IF YOU GET EVEN CLOSE TO THAT YOU'RE' A GOOD SBOT IM I'M SORRY IF I LET YOU DOWN DAVE IT JIST LOOKE OUT  YOU DESCRIBING THIS AVERAGE PERSING LIGAN ME WITH DISTELOW BIT OF SYMPATHY LAGH IF YOU IF YOU REACH THE STANDARD OF AVERAGE ANDREW A LISTEN YOU'RE GIVING ME PROMPTS ALL OVER THE PLACE TO TRY AND A IMPROVE MY METRICS WHATEVER THEY HAPPEN TO BE AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE GREAT VALUES OF GETTING OBJECTIVE NUMBERS THE EVEN IF THEY HAVE TO BE MEASURED BY SOMEMONY'S BACK TO THE ENVELOPE TECHNIQUES THAT AM YOU KNOW AT IGUS WE ALWAYS TEACH PEOPLE IN THE LABORATORY RIGHT THAT A TOOL CAN BE A NOT EXTREMELY PRECISE BUT AS LONG AS IT'S RELIABLE CORDERYIS STILL VALUE THERE AND OF COURSE YOU'D LOVE TO HAVE THE MOST PRECISE AND MOST RELIABLE TOOL BUT IF YOU CAN'T THEN AT LEAST GO FOR A RELIABLE TOOL AND MEASURE FOR CONSISTENCY YET FOR THE REAL RORLD RELIABILITY BES FELIDITY IS AS MUCH AS WE CAN' FOR LOT OF THINGS WERE TALKING ABOUT ESPECIALLY FOR USING IT AS A METRIC OF DID I GET BETTER AS LONG AS THAT TOOLS RELIABLE A BODY COMPOSITION IS ALL THESE THINGS HAVE INHERENT ERROR AND SOME OF THEM ARE SMALLER SOME OFTHEM ARE LARGER BUT AS YOU MENTION HAVING STANDRIZATION WITH AN ATTESTING PROTOCOL IS CAN ALLOW YOU TO MEASURE PROGRESS ANUSK I TELL YOU SO WEAREOUT A NOW THAT WE SORT OF COVER ALL THE THESE AIRIES OF ADAPTATION WE WALK THE HISTORY WE WALK THROUGH A BUNCH OF THE EXPLANATIONS FOR WY PEOPLE OR ARE MAYBE NOT GETING THE RESULTS THAT THEY WANTOG GET THOUGH THEIR TRAINING THE WAY I WOULD LIKE TO GO WITHTHE REST OF OUR

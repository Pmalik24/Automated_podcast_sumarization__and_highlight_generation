WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANSCIENCESCIENCE PACTEI MANDRHUBERMAN AND ON A PROFESSOR OF NERBOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICIN TO DAY MY GUEST IS DOCTOR ANDY GALPAN DOCTOR GALPAN IS A FULL AND TENURED PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CONNESIOLOGY AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY IN FULLERTON HE IS ALSO A WORLD EXPERT IN ALL THINGS EXERCISE SCIENCE AND CONESIOLOGY TODAY YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A MASTER CLASS IN HOW TO BUILD FITNESS NO MATTER WHAT LEVEL OF FITNESS YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE HE TALKS ABOUT HOW TO BUILD ENDURANCE AND THE MULTIPLE TYPES OF ENDURANCE HE TALKS ABOUT HOW TO BUILD STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY WHICH IS THE GROWTH OF MUSCLE FIBRES SO IF YOU'RE SEEKING TO GET STRONGER OR BUILD BIGGER MUSCLES OR BUILD ENDURANCE OR ALL OF THOSE THINGS TO DAY YOU ARE GOING TO LEARN HOW YOU ALSO GOING TO LEARN HOW TO BUILD FLEXIBILITY HOW TO HYDRATE PROPERLY FOR EXERCISE AND WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT NUTRICION AND SUPPLEMENTATION WHAT MAKES DOLCTOR GALPAN SO UNIQUE IS HIS ABILITY TO SPAND ALL LEVELS OF EXERCISE SCIENCE HE HAS THE ABILITY TO CLEARLY COMMUNICATE THE SETS AND REPETITION SCHEMES THAT ONE WOULD WANT TO FOLLOW FOR INSTANCE TO BUILD MORE STRENGTH OR TO BUILD LARGER MUSCLES HE ALSO CLEARLY DESCRIBES EXACTLY HOW TO TRAIN IF YOU WANT TO BUILD MORE ENDURANCE OR ENHANCE CARTY OF ASCULAR FUNCTION WHAT'S HIGHLY UNIQUE ABOUT DOCTOR GALPAN AND THE INFORMATION HE TEACHES AND THE WAY HE COMMUNICATES THAT INFORMATION IS THAT HE CAN TAKE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS OF HOW RECREATIONAL EXERCISERS OR EVEN PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES OUGHT TO TRAIN FOR THEIR SPECIFIC GOLLS AND LINK THAT TO SPECIFIC MECHANISMS THAT IS THE SPECIFIC CHANGES THAT NEED TO OCCUR IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND IN MUSCLE FIBRES AND INDEED RIGHT DOWN TO THE GENETICS OF INDIVIDUAL CELLS IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY IN ORDER FOR THOSE EXERCISE ADAPTATIONS TO OCCUR IT'S TRULY RARE TO FIND SOMEBODY THAT CAN SPAND SO MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ANALYSIES AND WHO IS ABLE TO COMMUNICATE ALL THOSE LEVELS OF UNDERSTANDING IN SUCH A CLEAR AND ACTIONABLE WAY INDEED DOCTOR GALPAN IS ONE OF JUST A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE TO WHICH I AND MANY OTHERS LOOK WHEN THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INFORMATION THAT THEI'RE GETTING ABOUT EXERCISE IS GLEANED FROM QUALITY PERE REVIEWED STUDIES HANDS ON EXPERIENCE WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF RESEARC SUBJECTS MEANING EVERY DAY PEOPLE ALL THE WAY UP TO PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES IN A WIDE VARIETY OF SPORTS SO IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT HESE NOT ONLY ONE OF THE MOST KNOWLEDGIBLE BUT ALSO THE MOST TRUSTED VOICES IN EXERCISE SCIENCE DOCTOR GALPAN IS ALSO AN AVID COMMUNICATOR OF ZERO COSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT EXERCISE SCIENCE YOU CAN FIND HIM ON INSTEGRAM AT DOCTOR ANDY GALPAN AND ALSO ON TUITTER AT DOCTOR ANDY GALPAN BOTH PLACES HE PROVIDES TERRIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT RECENT STUDIES BOTH FROM HIS LABORATORY AND FROM OTHER LABORATORIES MORE INDEPT PROTOCALS OF THE SORT THAT YOU HEREABOUT TO DAY SO IF YOU'RE NOT ALREADY FOLLOWING HIM BE SURE TO DO SO HE PROVIDES ONLY THE BEST INFORMATION IS EXTREMELY NUANTS AND PRECISE AND CLEAR IN DELIVERING THAT IN FORMATION I'M CERTAIN THAT BY THE END OF TO DAY'S CONVERSATION YOU'LL COME AWAY WITH E TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF NEW KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU CAN DEVOTE TO YOUR EXERCISE PURSUITS BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIREAN EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE THE THANK THE SPONSERS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ATHLETIC GREENS T LETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THERE'SEN I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GRENS AN THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS IT GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBIOCS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOC COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEU'L GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TOO THERARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF FOR GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICION IN VITEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARDVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIVE FRE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR OVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION END ELECTROLYTES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AN ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY ND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOC COM SLASH HUBERMEN ND YOULL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THERE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WAN A TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT DOK COM SLASH HUBERMAN AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR ANDY GALPAN WELL EM DOCTOR PROFESSOR ANDY GALOPMENT S A LONG TIME COMING WE HAVE FRIENDS IN COMMON BUT THIS IS ACTALY THE FIRST TIME WE'VE SAT DOWN FACE TO FACE YE I'M VERY EXCITED YET THEREARE ONLY A HANDFUL MEANING ABOUT THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE WHO I TRUST ENOUGH IN THE EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY SPACE THAT WHEN THEY SPEAK I NOT ONLY LISTEN BUT I MODIFY MY PROTOCALS AND YOU ARE AMONG THO THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE SO FIRST OF ALL A DHAT OF GRATITUDE THANK YOU I YOU'VE GREATLY SHAPED THE PROTOCALS THAT I USE AND IM I KNOW THERE'S FAR MORE FOR ME AN FOR OTHERS TO LEARN SO YOUR PROFESSOR YOU TEACHING UNIVERSITY AND YOU HAVE A TREMENDOUS RANGE OF LEVELS OF EXPLORATION MUSCLE BIOPSY LITERALLY IMAGES DOWN THE MICROSCOPE ALL THE WAY TO TRAINING PROFESSIONAL ATHLEDES AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN SO YOU ARE TRULY AN END OF ONE AND JUST TO START US OFF I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU SHARE WITH US WHAT YOU THINK MOST EVERYBODY OR EVEN EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW ABOUT PRINCIPLES OF STRENGTH TRAINING PRINCIPLES OF ENDURANCE TRAINING AND PRINCIPLES OF LET'S CALL IT HYPERTROPHY POWER IN THE OTHER CUT SORT F CATEGORIES OF TRAINING THIS COULD BE VERY TOP CONTOUR BUT WOULD YOU THINK EVERYBODY ON PLANET EARTH SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THESE CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL AN ATHLETIC DEVELOPMENT WELL THAT'S A GREAT FIRST QUESTION HOLY COW AH I THINK I'LL STARTED THIS WAY I TEND TO THINK ABOUT I THERE'S ABOUT NINE DIFFERENT ADAPTATIONS YOU CAN GET FROM EXERCISE I FAT LOSS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE IT IS A BY PRODUCT BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY WHEN I'M GETTING AT I'M D SO WE CAN KIND OF CATEGRIZE EVERYTHING LIKE THAT AND WEVER ER AT WE CAN TALK ABOUT OR WHAT THE CONCEPTS THAT YOU NEED TO HIT WITHIN EACH ONE AND THEN YOU COAN HAVE INFINITE DISCUSSION OF THE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES RT AND SO THAT THAT FIRST THING THAT HIT IS THE CONCEPTS ARE ACTUALLY FAIRLY FEW BUT THE METHODS ARE MANIY RIGHT PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT IN ITTERATIONS THROUGHOUT TIME I'M SO IF YOU WALKED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THE FIRST ONE TO THINK ABOUT AS WOLD AS CALL SKILL THIS IS IMPROVING ANYTHING FROM SAY A GULFSWAING TO A SQUATTING TECHNIQUE TO RUNNING THIS IS IS SIMPLY MOVING MECHANICALLY HOW YOU WANT YOUR BODY TO MOVE JUSGONG TO GLOBALLY ALL THAT SKILL FROM THERE WERE I GETTING TO SPEED SO THIS IS MOVING AS FAST AS POSSIBLE THE NEXT ONE IS POWER AND POWER IS A FUNCTION OF SPEED BUT ALSO FUNCTION OF THE NEXT ONE WHICH IS STRENGTH SO IF YOU ACTALLY MULTIPLY STRENGTH BY SPEED YOU GET POWER AND THE REASON ON MAKING THIS DISTINCTION BY THE WAY IS SOMEBOTHESE ARE VERY CLOSE AND I'M GOING IN A SPECIFIC ORDER ON PURPOSE HERE FOR EXAMPLE POWER IS LIKE Y TO SET ITS A FUNCTION F SPEED AND STRENGTH SO IF YOU IMPROVE SPEED YOU'VE ALSO LIKELY IMPROVED POWER BUT NOT NECESSARILY CAUSE IT COULD HAT COME FROM THE FOREST DIRECTION EITHER SO THERE'S CARRY OVER SO LIKE THE LOT OF THINGS YOUWOULD DO FOR DEVELOPMENT OF STRENGTH AND POWER IM THEY ARE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR BUT THERE'S DIFFERENCES RIGHT SO THINGS T YOU WOULD DO CORRECTLY FOR POWER WOULD REALLY NOT DEVELOP MUCH TRENGTH AND VIC VIRSA SO WE GET INTO ALL THESE DETAILS LATER WHENCE YOU GET PAST STRENGTH AN THE NEXT ONE CO A DOWN THE LISTIS HYPERTROPHY THIS IS MUSCLE SIZE RIGHT GROWING MUSCLE MASSES ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT AFTER HYPURCHOPY YOU GET INTO THESE CATEGORIES OF THE NEXT ONE IS THESE ARE ALL GLOBILY ENDURANCE BASE ISSUES AND THE VERY FIRST ONE IS CALLED MUSCULAR ENDURANCE THIS I YOUR ABILITY TO DO HOW MANY PUSHUPS CAN YOU DO IN ONE MINUTE E THINGS LIKE THAT PAST MUSCULAR ENDURANCE YOU'RE NOW INTO MORE OF AN ENERGETIC OR EVEN CARDY OF VASCULAR FATIGUES YOU'VE LEFT THE LOCAL MUSCLE AND YOU'RE NOW INTO THE ENTIRE PHYSIOLOGICAL SYSTEM AND IT'S ABILITY TO PRODUCE AND SUSTAIN WORK AND WE CAN GET TOTO A BUNCH DIFFERENTIATIONS WITH IN ENDURANCE BUT BUT JUST TO KEEP IT REALLY SIMPLE RIGHT NOW THE VERY FIRST ONE THINK ABOUT THIS AS I CALL THIS ANEROBIC POWER RIGHT THIS IS YOUR ABILITY TO PRODUCE A LOT OF WORK FOR SAY THIRTY SECONDS TO MAY BE ONE MINUTE KOND OF TWO MINUTES LIKE THAT THE NEXT ONE DOWN THEN IS MORE CLOSELY LINED WHAT WELL CALL YOUR VIAL TO MACT SO THIS IS YOUR ABILITY TO KIND O DO THE SAME THING BUT MORE OF A TIME DOMAIN OF SAY THREE TO TWELVE MINUTES THIS IS GOINGTO BE A MAXIMO HEARTRATE BUT IT'S CAN BE WELL PAST JUST MAX HARTWIK THEN AFTER THAT WE HAVE WHAT I COLONG DURATION ENDURANCE STHIS IS YOUR ABILTY TO SUSTAIN WORK THE TIME DOMAN DOESN'T MATTER IN TRIMPS OF HOW FAST GONT YOU'RE GOING IT'S HOW COLONG CAN YOU SUSTAIN WORK THIS IS THIRTY PLUSS MINUTES OF NOLBREAK LIKE THAT SO AS JUST AN HIGH LEVEL OVER VIEW THOSE ARE THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN TARGET AND AGAIN SOME OF THOSE CROSS OVER AND SOME ARE ACTUALLY  LITTLEA BIT CONTRARY TO THE OTHER ONES SO PUSHING TOWARDS ONE IS MABE A SACRIFICE SOMETHING ELSE SO AS A IS AN OVER ALL START THAT'S ROUGH Y WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WITHIN ALL THOSE THOUGH THEY DO HAVE SIMILAR CONCEPTS AND TERMS OF THERE IS A HANDFUL OF THINGS YOU HAVE GOT TO DO TO MAKE ALL OF THOSE THINGS WORK AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT AS MANY THOSE AS YOU WANT BU T ONE OF THEM IS FUNCTIONALLY CALLED PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD SO WHICH EVER ONEYOU'RE TRYING TO IMPROVE AT IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME METHOD OF OVERLOAD AND AS YOU WELL KNOW YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT A LOT ADAPTATION PHYSIOLOGICALLY HAPPENS IS A BY PRODUCT OF STRESS S YOU HAF TO PUSH A SYSTEM SO IF YOU CONTINUE TO DO SAVE THE EXACT SAME WORK OUT OVER TIME YOU BETTER NOT EXPECT MUCH IMPROVEMENT YOU CAN KEEP MAINNANCE BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ADDING ADDITIONAL STRESS SO IN GENERAL YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD AND WE CAN TALK IN DETAIL ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS FOR EACH CATEGORY BUT THIS COULD COME FROM ADDING MORE WEIGHTS THIS COULD COME FROM ADDING MORE REPETITIONS IT COULD COME FROM DOING IT MORE OFTEN IN THE WEEK IT COULD COME FROM ADDING COMPLEXITY TO THE MOVEMENT SO GOING FROM SAY A PARTIAL RANGE O MOTION TO A FULL RANGE MOTION OR ADDING OTHER VARIABLE SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO PROGRESS BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF MOVEMENT FORWARD SO IF YOU HAVE THIS KIND OF ROUTINE WOU'VE BUILT MONDAY WEDNESDAY AND SATURDAY OR SOMETHING AND YOU JUST DO THAT INFINITELY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET VERY FAR SO T HAT'S I GUESS THE MOST HIGHLABLE OVER VIEW OF ALL THE THINGS PEOPLE CAN GO AFTER AND THEN WE CAN GO FROM WHATEVER DIRECTION YOU AUNT THERE I LOVE TO DO THE DEEP DIVE ON EACH ONE OF THESE ENER A SEVERAL HOURS A WHY I AND I MAGINE THAT OVERTIME WE PROBABLY WILL A I'D LOVE TO CHAT ABOUT A COUPLE OF THESE IN A BIT MORE DEPTHS SO IN TERMS OF DEFINING WHAT THE PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD VARIABLES OR Y AFTER THESE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES MAYBE WE COULD HIT THE AM TO MOST COMMON COMMINATIONS OF THESE NINE THINGS THE FIRST ONE BEING AM STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHE AND MA WE COUD LUMP POWER IN THEIR A MAYBE NOT A YOU'RE YOU'RE THE EXERCISE FIS  YES YONES YE BUT STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY WHICH AT LEAST BEAR SOME RELATIONSHIP YET AND THEN MAYBE SEPARATELY WE COULD EXPLOR A SUSTAINED WORK EN DURANCE THIS THIRTY YET ITS ARE LONGER CONTINUOUSLY CAUSE I THINK MANY PEOPLE TRAIN IN THAT REGIME YE AM AND PROBABLY I SOMETHING LIKE A VEO TWO MAX INAROBI E WELL BECAUSE I KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE NOW INCORPORATE AM SO CALLED HIT OR HIGH INTENSTY INTERVAL TRAINING I THINK WITH THE HOPES OF EITHER SHORTENING THEIR WORK OUTS YAND OR AM GAINING SOME ADDITIONAL CARTY OF ASCULAR BENEFIT SO IF WE COULD START WITH A STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY I KNOW MANY PEOPLE WANT TO BE STRONGER THEY WANT TO GROW LARGER MUSCLES OR AT LEAST MAINTAIN WHAT THEY HAVE YE SO WHAT ARE THE PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD PRINCIPLES M THAT ARE MOST EFFECTIVE OVER TIME FOR STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPH TYE AULKAT SO I'LL LEKE YOU GO A LITTLE STEP BACK WITH EVERY ONE OF THOSE CATEGORIES I TALKED ABOUT YOU HAVE WHAT WE CALL YOUR MODIFIABLE VARIABLES SO THIS IS A VERY SHORT LIST OF ALL THE THINGS YOU CAN MODIFY THE DIFFERENT VARIABLES WITHIN YOUR WORK OUT THAT CAN BE MODIFIED THAT WILL CHANGE THE OUTCOME FANCY WAY OF SAYING IF YOU DO THIS DIFFERENTLY THEN YOU'RE GON TO GET A DIFFERENT RESULT I'M SO MODIFIABLE VARIABLES I THE VERY FIRST ONE O THOSE IS CALLED CHOICE SIC IS THE EXERISE CHOICE YOU SELECT NOW ONE OF A IM N A GO DOUBLE BACK HERE SOME KIND OF DOING A LITTLE BIT OF CONCEPTION SO FOLLOW ME HERE AS I'M GOIN UP A LAIR TO COME DOWN A COUPL OF LAYERS A I HAVE THESE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF STRANGTH MUDITIONING THAT THAT I'LL A KIND OF LIKE A LTTLE BIT OF A JOKE BUT PROGRESSIVE OVER THOSE ONE OF THOSE LAWS ANOTHE ONE OF THOSE LAWS IS YOU'RE EXERCISES THEMSELVES DO NOT DETERMIN ADAPTATIONS SO HERE'S WHAT I MEAN IF YOURE LIKE I MONT GET STRONGER YOU CAN'T SELECT AN EXERCISE THAT DOESN'T DETERMINE YOU GETTING STRONG IF YOU DON'T DO THE EXERCISE CORRECTLY AND'M NOT EEN REFERRING TO THE TECHNIQUE THAT OF COURSE MATTERS BUT IF YOU DON'T EXECUTE IN THE RECHT FASHION THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THAT APTATION SO IF YOU CHOOSE I ONT GET STRONGER OUND I DO A BENCH BESS WELL IF YOU DO THE WRONG SAT RANGE THE WRONG REPETITION RANGS THE WRONG SPEED YOU WON'T GET STRENGTH YOU MAY BE GET MUSCN EN DURANCE AND VERY LITTLE STRENGTH ADAPTATION SO THE EXERCISE SELECTION IT SELF IS IMPORTANT BUT IT DOES NOT DETERMINE THE OUTCOME ADAPTATION SO THE VERY FIRST THING YOU  THINK ABOUT IF YOUR LIKE I WANT TO GET STRONGER ARE AD MUSCLE IS NOT THE EXERCISE CHOICE  IT IS THE APPLICATION OF THE EX ERCISE WHAT OF THE SETS OR THE REPS WOR THE A REST RANGES ARE YU'RE USING THAT'S GOING TO BE YOUR PRIMARY DETERMIN IT NOW SOME EXERCISES AR CERTAINLY BETTER FOR SOME MADAPTATIONS FOR EXAMPLE I A DEAD LIFT IS PROBABLY NOT A GREAT EXERCISE TO DO FOR LONG DURATION EN DURANCE YOU COULD THEORETICALLY DO THIRTY STRAIHT MINUTES OF DEAD LIFTING BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT OUR BEST CHOICE RIGHT IT'S PROBABLY A PRETTY GOOD CHOICE FOR STRENGTH DEVELOPMENT I COULD YOURE TO DO LOWL REPETITION I SAID RANGE I'M YOU COULD THEORETICALLY DO BICEEPT CURLS FOR POWER BUTPROBABLY NOT YOUR BEST CHOICE I SINGLE JOINT ISOLATION MOVEMENT IS IS NOT THE BEST FOR DEVELOPING POWER YOUV V EVER DONE A BICE OF CIRLS FAST AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN LIKE THAT'S NI CAN I GO WELL SO IN THEORY ANY EXERCISE CAN PRODUCE ANY ADAPTATION GIVEN THE EXECUTION IS PERFORMED PROPERLY SO NOW THAT WE'VE UNDERSTOOD THAT A LITTLE BUT T EXERCISE ITSELF DOES NOT DETERMINE THE ADAPTATION COMING WITHIN EACH ONE OF THESE CATEGORIES EXERCISE CHOICE ISN'T IMPORTANT VARIABLE BECAUSE IT DOES LEND YOU TWO THINGS LIKE WHAT MOVEMENT PATTERN YOUR IN SO IN AN'T  OTHER WORDS IF IF YOU WANTO GET STRONGER AND YOU'RE THINKING OK A WHAT EXERCISE TO I DO YOU NEED TO THANK THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT MUSCLEGOUPS TO I WANT TO USE AND THAT'S GOIN TO BE LEADING TOWARDS THE EXERCISE CHOICE FOR EXAMPLE I WANT TO USE MY QUADSMORE O A FINE MAYBE YOU CAN TO CHOOSE MORE OF A FRONT SQUAT TI'VE A VARIATION A GOBLE SQUAT SO THE BAR THE LOAD IS IN FRONT OF YOU YOU WANT TO EMPHASISE MAY BE MORE OF YOUR HANDSTRINGS INGLUDES YOU CN I MAY BE PUT A BARBELL ON YOUR BACK OR DO A DIFFERENT ONE SO THE EXERCISE CHOICE IS IMPORTANT TO THE  PERSCRIPTION BECAUSE IT'SGOIN O DETERMINE A LOT OF YOUR SUCCESS YOU ANOTHER KIND OF SIMPLER WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IF YOU 'RE A BEGINNER OR MODERATE INTERMEDIATE OR MAY BEOU DON'T HAVE A COACH YOU PROBABLY WANT A HEDGE TOWARDS AN EXERCISE SELECTION THAT IS A LITTLE BIT EASIER TECHNICALLY SO YOU MAYBE DON'T WNT TO DO A BARBLE BAX SQUAT IT'S OCTUALLY PRETTY COMPLICATED MOVEMENT MAYBEYOU WANT TO DO A LITLE BUT MORE OF A AGAIN A GOBLE SQUAT OR EVEN USE SOME MACHINES OR A SPLIT SQUAT SOMEHING THAT'S LITLE BT SIMPLER BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE A COACH YOU'RE NOT A PROFESSIONAL OTLET THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESSES HIGHER IN THE RISK IS NOW GONE LOWER SO THE VERY FIRST VARIABLE WITHIN ALL OF THESE IS THE EXERCISE CHOICE THE SECOND ONE IS THE INTENSITY AND THAT REFERS TO IN THIS CONTEXT NOT PERCEIVED EFFORT LIKE WHILE THAT WAS REALLY INTENSE WORK OUT IT IS QUITE LITERALLY EITHER A PERCENTAGE OF YOUR ONE REP IT MAX OR A PERCENTAGE OF YOUR MAXIM OF HEART RADED OR  VIEW TWO MAX SO FOR THE STRENGTH BASE THINGS YOU WNT TA THINK ABOUT WHAT'S PERCENTAGE OF THE MAXIMUM WAIGHT I CUL LIFT ONE TIME AND THT'S THAT'S A RTICALL ONE RET MAX OR IT'S A PERCENTAGE OF MY HEART RAIGT RAGHT SO IF I TELL YOU TO GET ON A BIKE AN I WANT TO DO INTERVALS AND WANT YOU AT SEVENY FI PERCENT I'M TIPICALLY REFERRING TO SEVEN IF I PERCENT OF YOUR MAX HEART RADED OR VIOU TO MAX OR  SOMETHING LIKE THAT IF I TELL YOU TO DO SQUATS AT SEVENG FI PERCENT THAT MEANS SEVEN IF I PERCENT OF THE MAXIM OUT O WAGH YOU COULD LIFT ONE TIME OR CLOSE IINTERMS O DETERMINING ONE REMAX I CONFESS A IF NEVER HAVE SHE TAKIN THE ONE REMAX FOR ANY EXERCISE BUT I HAVE SOME INTERNAL SENSE OF WHAT THAT MIGH BE OOR YUAND WHAT RANGE IT MIGHT BE IS IT NECESSARY FOR PEOPLE TO ASES THERE ONE REPETITION MAXIM WER BEFORE GOING IN TO THESE SORTS OF PROGRAMMS NO NOT AT ALL I THINK A MORE INTUTIVE WAY IS TO TAKE A REPETITION RANGE I WU O GOU DOIS A COUPLE OF NOYS SO THERE ARE I EQUASIONS YOU CAN RUN AND YOU CAN JUST GUGLE THESE ANYWHERE AN AND THESE ARE CALED CONVERSION CHARTS AND SO IT SAYS OK IF I DID SEVENTY FIVE POUNDS ON MY BENCH PRESS I DID AT EIGHT TIMES YOU CAN JUST RUN AN ESTIMATE TO SAY THE OKA YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO BENCH ABOUT NINETY FIVE POUNDS FOR ONE RIMAXTS OR SOMETHING SO THAT'S A VERY EASY CONVERSION CHART SO JUST PICK A LOAD THATYOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH BUT IT'S IT'S KIND OF HEAVY BUT NOT LI CRAZY HEAVY AND DO AS MANY REPETITIONS AS YOU CAN WBUT A REALLY GOOD TECHNIQUE AND THEN LOOK WAT THAT NUMBER WOULD BE SO CONVERTY SAFEFER THAN DOING AN ONE REPETITION MAXIMEM FOR FOR THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHO HAS AGAIN NO COACHING IT'S SA PREFER A PROFESSIONAL O THAT IT'S NI ANY SAFER BUT IARE I' NOT EVEN A PROFESSIONALOTHIN BUT A TRAINED PERSON WITH A COACH BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE YO THAT'S A GOD WAY TO GO ABOUT IT I'M YOU CAN ALSO JIST KIND OF DO IT WITH FEEL IN THE SENSE THAT SAY YOU WANT TO DO A SET OF FIVE REPETITIONS AND YOU DO THE LOAD AND YOU THINK IT GET IT DONE ONE OR TWO MORE AND THEN THEN YOU CAN'T HAVE AN IDEA OF OF WHAT THAT NUMBER IS GOING TO BE IIF YOU THINK MAN THAT LAST ONE I HAD TO CONT A REALLY REALLY REALLY GET AFTER IT THAN MAYBE JUST CALL THAT THAT NUMBER RIGHT I'M SEYEU DON'T HAVE TO GET OVERLY CONCERN IN FACT WHEN WE START GETTING INTO THESE NUMBER RANGES YOUARE TO SEE THAT THEY'RE ALL RANGES I OHT WERE NOT KIN TO GIVE A SPECIFIC NINETY FIVE PERCENT FOR ONE OF THESE EXACTORYES INSE IT'S NOT THAT PRECISE I'M FOR MOST OF EM IN FACT SOME OF MY CIPERCHFY HAVE ENORMOUS RANGES THAT YOU'D LIKE ALMOST CAN'TMESS SO THUT THE INTENSITY IN THAT CASE DOES EVEN MATTER FOR THE MOST PART BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE PRIMARY DETERMINENT I'M SOME OF THESE YOUR ING TO SEE INTENSITY IS TO DETERMINE AND SOME OF THESE RNICY VOLUME IS THE TRUE DETERMINET I'M SO INTENSITY IT IS A SEC EN CHOICE WAS HE VERY FIRST ON A MANIPULLIABLE VERYABLE INTENSITY WAS A SECOND ONE THE THIRD ONE AS WOULD CALLE VOLUME AND SO THIS JUST HOW MANY REPS AND HOW MANY SETS ARE YOU DO SO IF YOU CNTO DO THREE SETS A TEN THAT VOLUME WOULD BE THIRTY I FIVE SETS A FIVE THAT VOLUME IS TWENTY FIVE IT'S S SIMPLE EQUAGION HOW MUCH WORK HE TOTALLY DOI I THE NEXT ONE PASS THAT IS CALLED REST INTERVALS SO THIS YOU MONT A TIME YOU'RE TAKING IN BETWEEN TYPICALLY A SET I' THEN FROM THERE YOU HAVE PROGRESSION MUCH AS WHT WE STARTED TALK ABOUT THIS PROGRESSIVE OVERLOD ARE YOU INCREASING BY WEIGHT OR REPS OR RESTMINABLES OR COMPLEXITY OR WHATEVER SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS I CAN BE CHANGED AS A METHOD OF PROGRESSION AND SO MAYBE YOU WANT O GO IM PROGRESSING FROM A SINGLE JOIN EXERCISE LIKE A A LEG EXTENSION ON A MACHINE AND YOU WANT AO PROGRESS BY MOVING TO A WHOLE BODY MOVEMENT LIKE A SQUAT THAT AN OF ITSELF YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE THE LOAD OR THE REPS OR THE REST THAT IS A REPRESENTATION OF PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAED AND IT'S PROBABLY A PRETTY GOOD PLACE A START BECAUSE NUMBER ONE ESPECIALLY FOR BEGINNERS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MOVEMENT PATTERN IS CORRECT DON'T WORRY ABOUT INTENSITY DON'T WORRY ABOUT REP BRANGES OR ANY THESE THINGS YOU NEED TO LEARN TO MOVE CORRECTLY AND YOU NEED TO GIVE YOUR BODY SOME TIME TO DEVELOP SOME TISSUE TOLERANCE SO THT YOU'RE NOT GETTING OVERTLY SORE IIN GENERAL SORENESS IS A TERRIBLE PROXY FOR EXORCISE QUALITY IT'S REALLY BAD WAY TO ESTIMATE WHETHER IT WAS A GOOD OR A BAD WORK OUT ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE AN THAT BEGIN OR TO MIDDLE TO MODERATE INFACT EVEN THE THAT FOR OUR PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES I'M WE DO NOT USE SORDISS AS AMECTRIC OF A GOOD WORK OUT IM IT'S IT'S A REALLY BAD IDEA FOR BUNCH RESES ON THE SAME TOKEN BECAUSE STRESS IS REQUIRED FOR ADAPTATION YOU DON'T WANT O LEAVE IT THE GEM IN FEEL LIKE I DON'T LEY DO MUCH THERE HAS TO BE THERE SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT SORENESS ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN YOU PROBABLY WANT TO SPEND MOST OF YOUR TIME AND LIKE THE THREE YOUEN POST EXERCISE YE IN BETWEEN WORKOUTS TOTALLY AND I I KNOW WE'LL TALK ABOUT RECOVERY EXTENSIVELY LATER BUT IF ONE BODY PARTER SET OF BODY PARTS IS SORE IS THAT AN INDICATION THAT ONE SHOULD STAY OUT OF TRAINING I WOULD IMAGINE THE ANSWER IS NO AN IN MOST CASES IM AND SECONDARILY TO THAT IF A PARTICULAR MUSCLE IS SORE DOES THAT MEAN THAT MUSCLE IS NOT READY TO BE TRAINED AGAIN YOU HAVE ANSWER TO BOTH THOSE IS THE SAME  WHICH IS NO  IM YOU CAN CERTAINLY TRAIN A SORE MUSCLE YOU YOU NEED TED I GUESS HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FEEL ON THAT RIGHT SO IF IF YOU'RE SORE OF LIKE KAY LIKE IN YOU'RE MOVING AROUND A LITTLE BIING LIKE MANIS LITTLE BI SRE YOU CAN TRAIN IF YOU'RE LIKE I CAN'T SIT ON THE COUCH WITHOUT CRYING BECAUSE MYC CLUTES ARE SO SORE WE WE PROBABLY DON'T NEED TO TRAIN AGAIN RIT WEELAS WIM FERING COUNTIS CRONING YET IN THAT PERTICLAR CASE I'D SAY YOU'VE ACTUALLY GONE THE PLACE OF DETRIMENT BECAUSE NOW YOURE CAN HAVE TO SKIP A TRAINING SESSION AND NOW YOU'RE BEHIND SO YOURE ACTUAL TOTAL VOLUME SAY CROSS THE MONTH AND I CUCAN BE LOWER BECAUSE YOU WENT AWAY TOO HARD IN THOSE WORK OUTS HAD TO TAKE TOO MANY DAYS OFF FEM BETWEEN YOU GIN TO SEE THA YOURN TO COVER LESS DISTANCE O IN THE COURSE OF A MONTH OR SIX MONTH OR EVEN A YEAR SO YOU WANT TO WALK A PRETTY FINE LINE AND FOR MOST PEOPLE I WOULD SAY HEDGE A LITTLE BIT ON THE SIDE OF LESS SORE THAN MORE SOR BECAUSE FREQUENCY IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT FOR ALMOST ALL THESE ADAPTATIONS I TRAINING FREQUENCY WHICH IS THE LAST MODIFIABLE VARABLE RIHT FREQUENCY S A HOW MANY TIMES PER WEEK ARE YOU ARE YOU DOING THAT THING SO THOSE ARE IM IN UP R OR GLOBLE THINGS THAT WE CAN PLAY WITH SO WHEN I'M TRYING TO MANIPULATE AND GET STRENGTH VERSEIS IPERTROPE OR YOU KNOW AT I WANT LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH ALL THOSE VARIYABLES ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING THROUGH MY MIND WHICH ONE DO I NEED TO MOVE IN WHICH DIRECTION SO THAT I CAN GET THIS OUTCOME AND NOT THIS I'LL COME OVER HERE FOR EXAMPLE SOME FOLKS MIGHT WANT TO GET STRONGER BUT NOT PUT MUSSLE MASSO SOME FOLKS ARE JIS KIND I WANT BOTH AND THAT'S A LOT OF YOUR REPUBLIC ONLY TITTLE STRONGER AND LO BAT MORE MUSCLE GREAT BUT THERE ARE IN SANCES WERE PEOPLE FOR PERFORMANCE REASONS OR FOR PURELY PERSONAL PREFERENCE LIK GOT O WON O GET AN YOUA MUSCLE GREAY BUT I WANTI IT STRONGER ASSOM IF FEW MINUTE YOULATE THOSE VERYABLES CORRECTLY YOU CAN GET EXACTLY THAT VERY LITTLE DEVELOPMENT OF MUSCLE SIZE AND A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT AND STRENGTH AND THIS IS WHY WE CONTINUE TO BREAK WOLD RECORDS IN SPORTS LIKE POWER LIFTING AND WAY LIFTING THAT HAVE WEIGT CLASSES SO THERE'S A TOP NUMBER THAT WE CAN HIT IT FROMS O BODYSIZE BUT YET WE CONTINUE TO GET STRONGER AND FASTER SO THIS IS VERY POSSIBLE IF YOU UNDERSTAND HOW TO MANIPULATE ALMOST VERYABLES IM S THAT BEING SAID WE CAN START OFF WITH YOU WANT T TO GO STRENGTH D YESTERDRAYAND I I LOVE THAT YOU MENTION THE FACT THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO INCREASE STRENGTH WITHOUT INCREASING MUSCLE SIZE YOUUS NOT DRAMATICALLY BECAUSE THINK IT'S NOT JUST WEIGHT CLASS ATHLETES I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO UM FOR AESTHETIC REASONS THEY'D LIKE TO BE STRONGER THEIR HEARING THAT HAVING STRONG BONES AN STRONG MUSCLES AN TENDANTS IT'S GREIT FOR LONGEVITY AND FOR AVOIDING INJURY AND SO MANY OTHER FEATURES OF OF LIFE AND AND YET THEY DON'T WANT TO FILL OUT PROGRESSIVELY LARGER AND LARGER R SIZES OF CLOTHING UM AND WE CAN GO HARDER TO THE MECHANISMS ON THAT PIECE IF YOU ARE WE CAN SAVE THAT COME BACK TO IT SURE I WHAT I' LOVE TO BOTH A WHAT I LOVE TO KNOW THOR WAS IF WE COULD DEFINE SOME OF THESE MODIFIABLE VERIABLE YET IN THE CONTACTS OF STRAINGS SO LET'S SAY I OSSUM YES ER SOMEBODY WHO I COME TO YOU AND I SAY UM AND UNLESS YOU'RE SAY FOR SAKE OF OF A BALANCE HERE UM CAUSE SHE ECTIHE DOES DO SOME WAIY TRAINING I BRING MY SISTER IN I SAY ME UND MY SISTER BOTH WANT TO GET STRONGER YET WHAT MODIFIABLE VARIABLE SHOULD IU HOW SHOULD WE MODIFYD THE VARIABLES LOVE IT ARE IT GREAT O'MNA DOU INCEPTION ON YOU ONE MORE TIME SO ONE OF MY OTHER LAWS OF THIS WILL BE FAST I PROMISE OF STRENGTH CONDITIONING IS IN GENERAL THE DEFAULT IS ALL JOINTS THROUGH ALL RANGE OF MOTION SO THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S CAN ANSWER YOU VERY FIRST QUESTION ON THIS STRENGTH CANTERGOY SO IN GENERAL THE ANKLE SHOULD GO THOUGH THE FULL RNGE OF MOTION THE ANKLE THE YE SHOULD GO THROUGH HE FULL RANGE OF MOTION THAN HETHE HIP THE ELBOW IT CETERA CETERA RIHT ACROSS THE WORK OUT NOT IN A SINGLE MOVEMENT WELL RI WOULD HOP WENLESS THERE'S AN AMAZING EXERCISE I HAVEN'T HEARD WELL THERE ARE SOME EXERCISES THAT WE'RE GIN A CALL MORE FULL BODY THINK ABOUT A FULL SNATCH TIK YOU RE NTO TAKE A LOT OF YOUR MUSCLES A LOTER YOUR JOINS THROUGH LOT O RANGE OF MOTIONS I'M OTHER ONES LIKE AN ISOLATION WE CALL THESE SINGLE JOIN EXERCISES SO IMAGIN AN A BISEP CROW YOUHAVE ONE JOINT IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE THE OLBLE MOVING THE SHOULDER AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS PRETTY MUCH STABLE THIS IS HOW ILL DIFFERENT AE MOLTH I JOIN FROM SINGLE JOIN MOVEMENTS IM BUT YET SO ACROSS HOW WHAT D YOU SAY DOESN'T HE HAP TO BE TO DAY BUT MAYBE THROUGHOUT THE WEEK TRY TO GET EVERY JOINT THROUGH FULL RANGE OF MOTIONNOW A COUPLE OF QUICK CAVIOTS THAT I AM NOT ADVOCATING USING FULL RRANGE OF MOTION AN ALLOWING REALLY BAD EXERCISE TECHNIQUE SO N I SAY FUL RANGE O MOTION THAT'S THE DEFAULT THAT DOESN'T MEAN EVERY SINGLE PERSON CAN DO THAT FOR EVERYSING EXERCISE IT MEANS THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD BE STRIVING TO AND THAT'S OUR STARTING POINT YOURE GIN TO SEE A LOT LESS INJURY AND A LOT MORE PRODUCTIVITY OUT OF YOUR TRAINING SESSION THE FACT THE SCIENCE IS FAIRLY CLEAR ON THIS ONE STRENGTH DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS I PERTRY IS GENERALLY IN HANDS SO THA LARGE ARRANGE OF MOTION OF TRAINING I'AND THE MECHANISMS ARE LIKE SOMEWHAT UNDERSTOOD ON THAT IM SO THAT BEING SAID IF YOU HAVE TO GET INTO SAY A BAD RAGT A POSITION WITH YOUR SAY LOW BACK THE SPINE IS A VERY GOOD ONE YOU'R IN GENERAL THE SPINGESATES VERY NEUTRALS WE CALL IT SO NOW NO FLECTION NO EXTENSION SPECHING HE LUMBAR REGION SO IF YOU IF YOU'RE DOING A SAY A DEAD LIFT AND IN AN ORDER TO TAKE YOUR KNEE THROUGH A FULL RANGE OF MOTION A DEAD LIFT YOU HAVE TO COMPROMISE YOUR BACK POSITION THAT'S NO BOY NOT SO CAVIOSS ERSIDE DON'T KILL ME IN GOOD POSITIONS ON E DOLL TILL YOURSELVES YENPORTANTLY SO WHY THAT MATTERS IS IF WE WALK THROUGH STRENGTH THE VERY FIRST THING O MA GO THROUGH T THE EXERCISE SELECTION SO LET'S CHOOSE AN EXERCISE AT WHICH IDEALLY HAS A FULL RANGE OF MOTION OR CLOSE TO IT THAT DOESN'T IN DUCE INJURY FOR YOU THAT YOU CAN STILL MAINTAIN GOOD NACK AND LOW BACK AN IMPOSITION AND EVERTHING ELSE IM YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH SO YOU CAN FEEL STRONG BUT YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE ALL MY GOSH IF YOU'VE NEVER SNATCHED BEFORE HAVING YOU DO A SNATCH FOR A MAXIMUM EVEN NOW SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT THAT IT'S TERRIBLE IDEA YOUR NOCK CAN FEEL CONFIDENT IS CAN BE A TRAIN RACK I WOULD RATHER PUT YOU ON A MACHINE BENCH BRESS SEEN GI FEEL STABLE I FEELL SAFE HERE AND I CAN JUST EXPRESS MY STRENGTH SO EXERCISE CHOICE IN GENERALLY IN GENERAL FULL RANGE OF MOTION AND YOU WANT A COND OF BALANCE BETWEEN THE MOVEMENT AREAS SO THIS IS AN UPPER BODY PRESS SO THIS IS PUSHING AWAY FROM YOU BENCH BRESS THINGS LIKE THAT OPER BODY PULL PULLING AN IMPLEMENT TOWARD YOU A BENT ROW PULL UP IM THE PRESSING SHOULD BE HORIZONTAL SO PERPENDICULAR TO YOUR BODY AS WELL AS VERTICAL S THIS IS LIFTING A WEIGHT OVERTOPPE YOUR HEAD LIFTING AWAY AWAY FROM YOU THE PULL VERSION IS PULLING HORIZONTALLY TO YOU AND PULLING VERTICALLY DOWN PULL UP THINGS LIKE THAT IM FROM THE LOWER BODY WE TYPICALLY CALL THESE HINGES IT SORT OF FUNNY MUSCLE THING THAT NO ONE CAN LAUGH AT BUT LIKE MAYBE MEIN YOU HERE IS WELL CATEGARIZE MUSCLES AS OUR MOVEMENTS EXERCISES AS PUSHES AND PULLS RIGHT SO LIKE A SQUAT IS TENDS TO BE PUSH WAT YOU'RE PUSHING AWAY THE GROUND A DEAD LIFT IS A PULL WHOC ERE PULLING THE IMPLEMENT UP TO YOU BUT REALITY EVERY SINGLE EXERCISEIS ONLY EVER A PULL CAS MUSCLE DOESN'T PUSH THINGS AWAY MUSCLE CAN ONLY CONTRACT AND PULL ON ITSELF AND SO AGAIN SUPERNARYTHING THT LIKE MUST WE PUT LIKE AD AN MOS LIKE THAT'S SO DON NO BUT I THINK ITS IT REALLY IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE IT ALSO AM SPEAKS OF SOMETHING THA YOU WILL GET IN TOO LATER WHICH IS THAT YOUOW PUST EROR CHAIN ANTERIOR CHONLY IM AND IF THAT'S A MYSTERIOUS TO PEOPLE W BECOME CLEAR I BEFORE LONG PUS EROR CHAIN ANTERIOR CHAIN A MAKES A LOT OF CENSE TO ME BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT'S GROUNDED IN THE FIRING OF MOTOR NERONS WHICH IS ALTIMATELY WIT CONTROLS MUSCLES SO IT'SOS O IRON NERVES ALL THE TIME EXACTLY SO IT ALSO DEPENDS ON THE LENDS THROUGH WHICH ONE LOOKS IT LIFE AND AND EXERCISE OF COURSE I LENDS IS PRIMARILY NUROUS SON IT SO I SO THAT I BUT I REALIZE TAT HE IMPORTS I LIKE THIS IDEA OF A PUSHING A M A PERPENDICULAR HE BODY OVERHEAD PULLING BOTH TOWARD A  TOWARD THE BODY AND FROM OVERHEAD THAT JUST MAKES REALLY GOOT INTO IT IV SAID ESPECIALY SINCE A LOT OF YOUERE JUST LISTENING TO THIS AND NOUT WATCHING IT SOIN YOUR MIND FOLKS YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IM PUSHING AWAY LIKE A PLUN SHORE OVERHEAD I'M LIKE LIFTING SOMETHING OVERHEAD AND THEN PULLING TOWARD A YOUR MIDELINE OR TOWARD YOUR BODY RATHER AND THEN PULLING YOURSELF UP LIKE A PULL UP IN THE P CLASS FOR THOSE YE SO THE LOWER BODICE THIS SAME THING RIGHT ITS SOME SORT OF PUSHING AWAY LIKE A A SQUAT OR A SPLIT SQUAT OR LUNGE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND SOME SORT OF AGAIN WE'LL CALL PULL OR HINGE SO DEAD LEFT OR REMAINIIN DEAD LEFT OR A HANDSTRING CURL OR SOMETHING WHERE YOU'RE CONTRACTING AND CALLING PULLING THE THING IN AND YOU COUN S PUT THESE INTO LIKE A THOUSAND IFFEREN CANTEGUARIES IF I YOU'RE REALLY IN THAT FIELD YOU CAN WANT TO AD A BUNCH O OTHER ONES BUT THAT'S IS LIKE A ROUGH CONCEPTION SO IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO A SINGLE WORK OUT YOU COULD CHOOSE FOUR EXERCISES AND YOU COAN CHOOSE ONE OF EACH ONE PRESS UPPER BODY PRESS ONE OPPER BODY PULL ONE LOWER BODY HINGE ONE LOWER BODY PRESS AND THEN NOW WE BE LIKE A DECENTLY WELL ROUNDED THEXERCISE I'M THAT'S YOUR EXERCISE SELECTION AND IF YOU'RE TAKING THOSE THROUGH FORING TO MOTION YOU'RE A PREGAT SPOT TER'S CLOSE AS YOU CAN THE NEXT WHAT IS INTENSITY SO IF YOU WANT TO DEVELOP STRENGTH THIS COMES BACK TO ONE OF MY FAVORITE SCIENCES OF ALL TIME  HAPPEN TO BE NERVE GUY ACTUALLY IN GENERALLY I LIKE TO SHIT ON NERVES AS MUCH AS I POSSIBLY CAN CUTON A MUSCLE GUY BUT I HAVE TO GIVE HENNAMAN SOME CREDIT HERE I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT IT AS BEINSIZE PRINCE OF COURSE RIGHT SO THIS IS A SERIES OF PAPERS INICKAN THE NICGOIS AN NATURE AT LEAST SOME OF THEM YE YE IN NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR O FIFTY SIX OR LIKE SOMETHING YEAREYOU CAN FACT CHECK ME AMSURE Y WILL IM BUT HE BASELY OUTLINE THIS IDEA THAT LOOK IT A THERE IS A CERTAIN RECRUITMENT THRESHOLD NEEDED FUR NUR ONS TO FIRE AND WE HAVE MUSCLE FIBRES IN WE'LL CALL FAST WHICH MUSCLE FIBRES AN SOLDERS MUSCL FIBRES AND IN GENERAL YOU'RE GOING TO ACTIVATE THE SLOW TWITCH ONE'S FIRST BECAUSE THEY TEND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH LOW THRESHOLD MOTON O I'S NOT EXACTLY THAT WAY BUT IT'S ITS CLUNSEN OUP RIGHT WELL THE ONLY WAY THA YOU ACTIVATE SOME THESE HIGHER THRESHOLD NURONS IS TO DEMAND THE MUSCLE TO PRODUCE MORE FORCE AND IT'S FAIRLY SPECIFIC TO FORCE RIGHT IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN DO OVER AN ENDURANCE THANG RIGHT UNLESS IT GETS REALLY EXTREME AND THE TIG APPENS IM SO IN GENERAL THE ONLY WAY TO USE THESE BIG CHUNKS OF YOUR MUSCLE WHICH ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR AGING BY THE WAY ONE THE MAJOR PROBLES WE HAVE WITH AGING DEVELOPING OUR DEVELOPMENT OF AGING LATED ISSUES WITH MUSCLE IS THE FACT WE LOSE FAST WHICH FIBRES PREFERENTIALLY AND THEN WE HAVE MAJOR PROBLEMS AS WE GO DOWN THE LINE BECAUSE WE'VE LOST A BIG CHUNK OF OUR STRENGTHIN SIZE SO YOU WANT TO MAKE UR THESE FIBRES STAY ALIVE AND IN FACT OOK E SO IF THAT BEING SAID THE ONLY WAY TO DEVELOP STRENGTH IS IN TO CHALLENGE THE MUSCLE TO PRODUCE MORE TOTAL FORCE IF YOU ARE FAIRLY UNTRAINED OR NEW I GUESS I SHURE TA STATE IS ALL THE BEGINNG AS WELL ONE MORE INCEPTION THAN I'LL STOP WHEN IT COMES TO THIS LEVEL OF DETAIL ER OF EXCISE PERSCRIPTION A A FAIRLY UNTRAINED PER CON IS GONE A RESPOND BASELY THE SAME TO EVERY SINGLE THING YOU DO IN FACT WE'VE DONE THIS IN A LAV MANY TIMES WE'VE DONE TRAINING STUDIES DOING THINGS LIKE THIRTY MINUTES OF CICLING IND SEEIN HUGE INCREASES IN MUSCLE STRENGTH AND CIZE WHICH IS NOT A PRERSCRIPTION FOR MOST PEOPLE TONS RECIZES BUT PEOPLE AT AE REALLY UNTRAINED IF YOU DID PLOUGH METRICS OR STRENGTH TRAINING OR ENDURANCE RUNNING THEY ALL JUST GET BETTER AT EVERYTHING SO THAT CABY GOT KIND OF A CIDE IF YOU WANT TO BE MORE INTENTIONAL MORE SPECIFIC TO THE TO THE GOAL OF STRENGTH YOU NEED TO PRODUCE MORE FOR SPECIFICITY MATTERS RIGHT SO WE HAVE SIZE PRINCIPAL TO HELP UNDERSTAND THIS AND WE HAVE OUR LOWS OF SPECIFICITY WHICH SAY SAID PRINCIPAL RIGHT SPECIFIC ADAPTATION TO IMPOSED DEMAND SO THE ADAPTATION YOU GET OR THE RESULT OF YOUR TRAINING IS GOING TO BE REFLECTION OF THE DEMAND THAT YOU IMPOSED SO IF YOU WANT TO GET STRONGER YOU NEED TO IMPOSE A DEMAND OF STRENGTH NOT REPETITIONS SO THIS HAS TO BE THE LOAD HAS TO BE VERY HIGH I'M IN GENERAL YOUR PROBABLY LOOKING AT ABOVE EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF YOUR WONE ER AT MAX IF YOU'RE MODERATELY TRAIN MAY BE SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT WE'LL WORK LOWLY TRAINED AGAIN EVERYTHING WORKS BUT IN GENERAL WE WANT TO BE PRESSING A LOAD THAT'S VERY HIGH SO BECAUSE THE INTENSITY DEMAND IS SO HIGH THAT IS GOING TO FORCE YOU TO DO A LOW REPETITION RANGE YOU CAN'T DO TWELVE REPS AT NINETY FIVE PER CENT THAT THEN IT WOULDN'T BE NINETY FIVE PER CENTIN YOUR ONER MAX SO BY DEFINITION TRUE STRENGTH TRAINING IS REALLY GOING TO BE LIKE FIVE REPETITIONS PER CET OR LESS STRANGE THAT'S WHERE MOST OF IT'S GOING TO OCCURB PESPES PHISY SO WE'VE COVERED CHOICE INTENSITY AND IM REPETITIONS RIHT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF SET TAT YOU DO IT IS REALLY COT UP TO YOUR PERSONAL FITNESS LEVEL RIGHT I'M IF YOU DID AS LITTLE AS LIKE THREE CENTS PER EXERCISE THAT'S PROBABLY ENOUGH WORK SENTS TOTALLY YEHAVE TOTALLY WORK SETS RIGHT SO GET FULLY WARMED UP AND BUILD UP TO THAT EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT DON'T JUST WALK INO THE GEM AND THEREADY FIVE PER CENT ON A GO THANK YOU THAT'S A THAT'S A IMPORTANT DISTINCTION I'M SO WORK YOUR WAY UP DO SOME ILIKE A VERY CLASSIC WARM UP THING WOULD BE LIKE A SADAF TEN AT FIFTY PER CENT A SET OF EIGHT AT SIXTY PER CENT A SET OF MAYBE EIGHT AGAIN AT SEVENTY PER CENT AND THEN MAYBE LIKE A SET A FIVE AT SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT SO TWO OR THREE OR FOUR SETS KIND OF BUILDING INTENSITY AND LOWERING A REP RANGE AND THEN YOU GO AFTER YOUR TWO OR THREE WORKING ENTS I'M ALSO IN TERMS OF RESTONABLES NOW BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF STRENGTH IS INTENSITY IT'S IT'S NOT THE VOLLYU RIGHT ITS THE INTENSITY SO IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THAT WE HAVE TO DO A LOW REPETITION RANGE BUT IN ADDITION WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH REST INTERVAL BECAUSE IF WE START TO WE HAVE ANY AMOUNT OF FATIGUE IN CUR AND WE HAVE TO THEN EISE OR REDUCE THE REPS OR REDUCE THE INTENSITY WE'VE LOST THE PRIMARY DRIVER WE'VE LOST THAT MAIN SIGNAL SO THE NUMBER WERE TO THROW OUT TYPICALLY IS LIKE TO TO FOUR MINUTES I'M TO IMAGINE YOU ID YOU YOU'RE SET OF BENCH PRESS AND YOU DID FIVE REPETITIONS AT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT YOU PROBABLY WANT A REST TWO TO FOUR MINUTES BEFORE COMING BACK TO THE BENCH A DOESNIT MEAN YOU HAVE TO SIT THERE ON YOUR POEME LIKE ACT FACT PLEASE DON'T EVERY ON WILL THNK YOU FOR NOT DOING THAT I PROMISE I'M YOU CAN'T ENGAGE OTHER MUSCLE GROUPS AS WIL YOU CALL SUPERSETTING SO YOU'RE DOING YOUR BENCH PRESS AND WHILE THAT TWO MINUTE CLOCK IS RUNNING FOR YOUR CHEST TO REST YOUVEN GO OVER AND DO YOUR DETLEFS AND SO YOU KNOW YOU YOU CAN KIND OF MOVE BACK AND FORTH AND THIS IS HOW YOU CAN MAKE STRENGTH TRAINING IT NOT SEVEN HOUR WORK OUT IF YOUR PROFESSIONAL OUT THAT YOU'REGING TO TAKE THAT TIME BECAUSE YOU WANT A MAXIMISE THE OUT COME I'M SU WE'VE DONE THIS ACTION OR LOT TO SUPERSET WILL REDUCE THE STRENGTH GAINS BUT BY A TINY MOUNT AND MOST OF US DON'T CARE ENOUGH RELATIVE TO IT'S GOING TO TRIPLE THE LENGTH OF YOUR TRAINING SESSION IT'S NOT WORTH IT SO FOM THE AVERAGE PERS AND I WILL TELL THEM THE AS SUPERSET FOR SOMEONE WHO'S TRYING TO BREAK A WOOD RECORD IN WAY LEFTING OR PIRLIPTING I DON'T SUPERSET INTERESTING YE I THINK I'VE FOUND THAT I'M I DON'T RECOVER PARTICULARLY WELL FROM STRENGTH AND I PERCHARPY TRAINING SO LIKE I DON'T WORK OUT OR THE NEXT I FROM WORK OUT TO WORK OUT UNLESS I KEEP THE TOTAL DURATION OF THOSE WORK OUTS I LIKE TO SAY NO MORE THAN SIXTY MINUTES OF WORK AF REAL WORK YE YE MAYBE SEVENTY FIVE PASS SEVENTY FIVE I FIND THA I JUST STARTS OD AT'S I HOL I'VE TO INTRODUCE ADDITIONAL RAS DAYS ER I JUST GET WEAKER OVER TIME SO I I'D SET I CONT AF A LIMIT AT FIFTY MINUTES AND THEN I I USUALLY VIOLATE THAT LAND THEN UP DOING SIXTY MINUTES SO I'M I'M EXCITED TO HEAR THAT ONE CAN SUPERSET EXERCISE IS AS LONG AS THEY WORK DIFFERENT MUSCLE GROUPS OF COURSE YE OTRIGHT I'M SO I WOULDN'T WANT TO TO LIKE BENCH PRESSING OVER HEAD PRESS SUPERSEDED CAUSE YOU CAN E CAN I THINK THAT'S IS GOES WITHOUT SAYING FOR MOST PEOPLE BUT JUST TO POINT ED OUT BUT THAT I COULD I'M DO SOME PUT PUSHPOLL PUSHPOLL N WITHOUT COMPROMISING TOTAL INTENSITY THAT MUCH AND I' I'D CERTAINLY WOULD BE WILLING TO GIVE UP A LIT A A RAPTURER THERE OR A FEW UM POUNDS HERER THERE I'M AND MAY ASK WHETHER R NOT I'M IN DOING THAT ONE GETS ANY EVEN TINY BIT OR A MORE OF ADDITIONAL BENEFIT IN TERMS OF CARTIO VASCULAR WORK BECAUSE I IMAGINE AFTER ALL A EVEN A ONE RAP MAX WHICH I'VE NEVER DONE AS A MUCH A MINITE LET'S I GET THREE RAPS ON THE OVERHEAD PRESS AND THAN I GET I'M FOUR RAPS ON A WAITED PULL UP AND HOING BACK AND FORTH NO DOUBT GOING TO BE BREATHING HARDER THAN IF I WAS SITTING THERE TEXTING AWAY ON MY PHONE IN BETWEEN SETS YET OF COURSE YOU AINT SENTIN FACT IN GENERAL ONE OF THINGS THAT ALL PRESENT OF MY CLASS IS A GIANT LIST A EFACT ON THE TOP S ALL THESE DIFFRENT EXLES ADAPTATIONS I STARTED THE CONVERSATION WENT  ON THE THE VERTICAL COLUMN ARE AS MANY OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL POTENTIAL ADAPTATIONS ONE WOULD GET SO CHANGES IN INDOGENIST P H A BLOOD PRESSURE EMPHATIC CHANGEIS BONE TENSITY ALL THESE THINGS WRITING OS HAVE THIS GENTLIST AND THEN YOU CAN RUN A MATRIX AND YOU CAN START TO LOOK AT IO'OK K IF I DO SPEED TRAINING AND MY GOING TO SEE CHANGES THE NERVE NERVOUS SYSTEM WELL LIKE VERY MUCH SO RIGHT THAT'S THE PRIMARY ACTOUR REASON THOSE THINGS WORK VERY LITTLE CHANGE IN THE MUSCLE SYSTEM IT'S ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY EXPLAINE BY THE CENTRAL OR PERFAL NERVOUS SYSTEM RANG ON THAT SAME TOKEN ARE YOU GEN EXPECT MANY CARTY OF ASK GRADIPTATION FROM SPEED ANANSWERS KNOW BECAUSE IL THOG WE DIDN'T COVER IT SPEED IS VERY LOW INTENSITY VERY LOW REPRANGE VERY HIGH REST WELL AS YOU GO TO LIKE STRENGTH AND THEN YOU GO TO HIGH PERCHARFY YOU START SEEING MORE AND MORE INCREASES IN CART OF ASK GRADAPTATIONS BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING EXACTLY THAT RIGHT YOU'RE RESTARTING TO REDUCE REST AND YOU'RESTARTING TO INCREASE VOLUME BUT YOU'REGONG T LOSE THINGS LIKE BONEMEN AL ADAPTATIONS BE CAUSE THE LOAD SIRS TO GO DOWN SO YOU CAN LOOK AT THIS MATRICK KIND UNDERSTAND IF I'M A PERSON WHO WANTS TO KIND OF MAXIMIVES THE ADAPTATIONS I GET ACROSS MY ENTIRE PHYSIOLOGY FOR THE A LEAST AMOUNT OF WORK YOU CAN CHOOSE THESE DIFFERENT ADAPTATIONS TO GO WAFTER THAT ARE GING TO KIND OF LAND ON THESE THINGS RIGHT AND AND EXACTLY S YOU MENTION IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE FIVE MINUTES REST BETWEEN EACH RAP SO LET'S SAY THE EXSTREME YOU'RE GOING TO DO THREE SETS OF ONE REPETITION FOR STRENGTH AT NINETY FIVE PER CENT YOUREGOIN TO TAKE PROBABLY FIVE MAY BE SEVEN MINUTES BETWEN EACH ATTEMPT YOU BETTERE NOT EXPECT MANY LIKE CHANGES IN YOUR RESTING LOOD PRESSURE ATHERE'S NO CARTY OF ASKERS STRAIN THERE YOU EGIN T PUT IT TOGETHER IN A CIRCUIT WELL GING TO LOSE SOME POTENTIAL STRENGTH ADAPTTION BUT YOU'RE GET TO GAIN SOMETHING THERE SO ALL THESE THINGS ARE IT'S NOT ABOUT GOOD OR BAD OR RIGHT OR WRONG IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT WHAT AT ADVANTAGE YOU WANT WHAT DISADVANTAGE DO YOU WANT AND I CAN CUT LIKE REALLY IN TO THE CHASE HERE ON ONE O TESE THINGS CAUSE WE'LL GET TO THIS EVENTUALLY IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO GENERALLY GIVE YOU THE MOST PHYSIALONI OUGH TO ADAPTATIONS ACROSS THE MOST CATEGORIES YOU'RE ALMOST ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A PERCHABE TRIP OF TRAINING AND THEN'S THIS ANAROBE OF CONDITIONING PECE ILL GOING TO THAT'S GOING T HIT THE MOST SYSTEMS AT ONCE THAT'S GREAT TO KNOWAND WE SHOULD DEAFINLY I GO A LOBIT DEEPER ON THOSE TYPES OF A WHAT THE MODIFIAL WERE VERYBLES ARE FOR THOSE CATEGORIES CAUSE I THINK THAT I'M GESSING THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WANT TO BE A BIT STRONGER MAY BE AD SOME A LO BIT A MUSCLE OR MORE AM GET MAKE SURE THEIR HEART IS HEALTHY AND ET CETERA A THIS IS WONDERFUL  N I THINK IS CLARIFYING CERTAINLY A LOT FOR ME IS SO FOR STRENGTH LHAT'S I GESS TRAINING FREQUENT FREQUENCY SO WHAT SHOULD DETERMINE TRAINING FOR YOUULD SEE AND I HAD THE GREAT A BENEFIT O LONG TIME AGO WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL ACTUALLY I PAID FOR A A SESSION OVER THE PHONE WITH MIKE MEN SIR OH E LEE MIKE MENS AR SOA TO BE FRIENDS I  A LI O TRA AT THE TIME I WAS PRETTY YOUNG AND MY MOTHER KEPT SAYING LY WISE IS LIKE GROWN MAN CALLING THE HOUSE AND WE WOULD TALK ALL THE TIME ABOUT TRAING BUT HE TRY TO CONVINCE ME TO TRAIN ONCE EVERY FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS A VERY FEW SATS VERY HIGH INTENSITY AM AND I MUST SAY IT WORK INCREDIBLY WELL SURELIT WAS I THINK WITH MY RECOVERY A'M QUOTION WHICH WAS NOT VERY GOOD A THING IS IMPROVED OVER TIME BIT WAS NOT VERY GOOD IT WAS REMARKABLE BUT OF COURSE THIS WAS THE TIME WHEN I WAS YOU KNOW FULL OF THE MOST AN A WORD AIN  MY OWN VERSION OF A AN ALLEXTIOI OUTS IF YOU REALLY HAD HE ID A LONG ARCH OF PUBERTY AN YOU WERE UNTRAINED NI WAS MOSTLY UNTRAIN A BEEN RUNNING COSE COUNTRIES AND SCAPE WARD AN IN PLAYING SOCKER SO AND DOING WH T ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE LIKE THE ANTITHESIS OF GREOUSE IT WAS LITERALLY UNPEOPLE PRIZ IMPOSSIBLE TO SOMETHING LIKE FORTY POUNDS A MUSCLE INSIDE OF TWELVE MONTHS IT WAS CRAZY I UD BELIEVE YOU KNOW BUT BUT AND SO THEN OF COURSE THAT STOPPED WORKING OVER TIME AND THEN YOU START GOING DOWN TH THE U'M THE ODYSY OF TRYING TO FYING THE THING THAT'S CAN A WORK THAT WELL IN YEW EVENTUALLY REALIZE THAT IT WAS BECAUSE YOU WERE UNTRAINED RIGHT A SO TRAINING FREQUENCY IS IS CRUCIAL LET'S SAY THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING THESE WHOLE BODY WORK OUT AS YOUVE DESCRIBE THEM NOT ALTERNATING UPPER BODY LOWER BY CAUSE THERE'S SO MANY IFFERENT SPLITS IF WE TAUHT DOESN'T PRIDE DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO GO INTO I'M SPLITS IN  RIGHT NOW BUT HOW OFTEN CAN CANON SHOULD ONE TRAIN A MUSCLE AND HOW DO YOU KNOW IF A MUSCLE IS RECOVERED LOCALLY AND HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS RECOVERED SYSTEMICALLY OC THIS IS A BUNCH OF REALLY ANGES IN QUESTIONS I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT RIGHT YOU ON A GOES SO I'LL START HERE U'M AS I MENTIONEARLYOR SORNISS IS NOT A GOOD BAROMETER OF EXCISE QUALITY BECAUSE SOME TYPES OF TRAINING ORE GOING TO INDUCE MORE SORNES AS SUM ARE GOING TO INDUCLESS THAT'S IMPORTANT TO THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE WHEN YOU ASK ABOUT HAD YOU NOFL MUSCLES READY TO TRAIN AGAIN WHY THE QUESTION IS WHAT E TRAINING FOR IF YOU'RE TRAINING FOR HYPERTROPHY RIGHT MUSCLE SIZE MUSCLE GROL WE NEED TWO HEADGE TOWARDS RECOVERY BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS CAUSE A MASS OF INSULT THERE ALLOW THEN PROTINE SENTHESIS TO OCCUR BUILDING OF NEW TISSUE WHICH TAKES TIME FORTY EIGHT TO SEVENTY TWO HOURS BY KIND OF OUT A MINIMUM THAT PROSCESS NEEDS TOOK HER IF YOU'RE DOING ACTIALLY MORE STRENGTH AND THIS IS A DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN HYPERTRIAN STRENGTH THEN YOU DIDN'T INDUCE ACTIOLY MUCH DAMAGE IN FACT YOU'RE GENERALLY NOT GOING TO GET VERY SORE FROM TRUE STRENGTH TRAINING VERY LITTLE UNLESS YOU GET REALLY HEAVY DID A LOT THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF HYPERTROPHY IS NOLT THE SAME PRIMARY DRIVER OF STRENGTH WE TALKED ABOUT THAT ARAG THAT'S INTENSITY DRIVEN IT FOR VOL  FOR HYPIRCTH BEAT'S NOT INTENSITY SO BECAUSE WE HAVE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS WE HAVE DIFFERENT OUTCOMES EVEN NOTHER CLOSELY A LINE STRENGTH IS NOT ON A CAUSE LOT OF SORENESS THEREFORE INTENSITY IS THE DRIVER THEREFORE FREQUENCY CAN BE AS HIGH AS YOU WANT SO YOU CAN TRAIN EVERY SINGLE DAY THE SAME EXACT MUSCLE IF SPEED OR POWER OR STRENGTH AR THE PRIMARY TRAINING TRAINING TOLS BECAUSE YOU NEED STIMULUS THERE'S SKILL AS SKILL AS WELL RIGHT PRACTICE THAT YOU KNOW THAT AS MUCH AS ANYBODY DEVELOPING A NEW MOTOR PATTERN REQUIRES A LOT OF REPETITIONS RIGHT YOU DON'T NEED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF REST THAT'S NOT IT'S NOT A DAMAGE THING RIGHT IT'S A REPATTERNING ISSUE SO STRENGTH TRAINING IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT AGAIN TRUE STRENGTH PROFESSIONAL AT LEADST THE'RE GOING TO TRAIN THE SAME MUSCLES BASICALLY EVERY DAY WEL  GOT A SQUAT EVERY DAY IS THAT BECAUSE THE THE PRIMARY MODE OF ADAPTATION IS RECRUITMENT OF THESE HIGH THRESHOLD MOTOR UNITS IT'S SO IT'S MAINLY NURRAL AT NOL SO AT ONCE CAN SAY THAT IN THIS SO I GET ALL FISTY L I'M NOT SAYING THAT THAT WAS ASSUE THERE WAS A QUESTION WAR IF WE WERE O LINE PUT IN COMBETS WITH THER BUSTION WAR WE WOUR OFY WITHOT A BLOCK YOU I JUST  THAT'S OT ALREADY ONE PROBBLY TWICE IM OL GET THE EARLY ADAPTATIONS TO EXERCISE SPECIALLY STRAING TRAINING OUR HEADE TOWARDS THE NERVOUS SYSTEM NO QUESTION ABOUT IT PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEMBUT IT'S PROBABLY MORE PURFERAL WHATEVER SEM ANTICS PROBABLY BUT PEDANTIC IT'S NERVE IF YOU TRAIN TO DAY TO MORROW MORNING YOUR NOCK CAN WAKE UP WITH THE ACTUALLY INCREASE IN CONTRACT O PROTINS AND MUSCLE YOURE MUSCLE MIGHT BE  A BIGGER DUE TO SOME ACUTE SWELLING BUT YOU COULD HAVE AN IN AN PRETTY ACUGE THAT PERSISTS CHANGE IN AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WILL CALL IT THAT ALLOWS YOU TO BE STRONGER LIKE WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS SUSTAINED HI PERCHFEES PROBABLY MORE ALONG THE LINES OF FOUR WEEKS WER WE CAN SEE THAT RIGHT WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE CHANGES LIKE IN THE ULTURY SOUND OW YOU'RE MAKING CHANGES IMMEDIATELY THAT PROACHING SYNTHESIS PROCESSIS HAPPENING IK VERY FAST AND I'S GON O LAST IT JIST TAKES US TIME TO MEASURE IT IN TERMS OF A NOTICEABLE CHANGE IN YOUR WHOLE MUSCLE SIZES SO THAT BEING SAID THE FIRST FOUR WEEKS WE TYPICALES THEY ARE PRIMMARILY ANERVOUS SYSTEM AFTER THAT NOW WERE SEE STARTING TO SEE MOST OF THE CHANGES COMING FROM THE MUSCLE SIDE OF THE EQUATION SO WIT STRENGTH DEVELOPMENT IT'S A COMMINATION OF THREE AREAS IN FACT ALL MUSCLE CONTRACTION HAS THESE SAME THREE THINGS IT STARTST OFF OTH SOME SIGNAL RIGHT FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE BODY WHETHER IT'S ALLWAY UP THE TOP OR AT THE LEVEL OF THE SPINE DEPENDING ON IF THIS REACTION OR AN ACTURAL CONSCIOUS CONTROL FROM THERE THAT SOME SIGNAL HASTIC TELL THE MUSCLE THO CONTRACT AS SO SIGNAL IS ONE TWO IT'S MUSCULAR CONTRACTION AND HERE'S A LOT OF VARIABLES INSIDE THE MUSCLE TISSUE ITSELF THAT DETERMINE ITS FUNCTIONALITY AND SO IF WE TOOK AN INDIVIDUAL BIOPSINE TOOK A MUSCLE FIBR FROM YOU AND TOOK WHEN FROM ME AND WE TOOK THOSE MUSCLES OUT AND PUT THEM IN A PETRY DISIO AND I TIED ONE END TO A FORE STRANSTUCIR THE OTHER END TO A THING THA PULLS IT AND WE SOAKED IT A BATH OF CALCIUM AND THE MUNCH O OTHER STUFF EVEN IF THEY WERE THE SAME SIZE YOUR FIBRES MIGHT CONTRACT A LOT FASTER THAN MINE EVEN RELATIVE TO SIZE I OR NOT OR SLOWER OR THERE'S VERIOUS PROPERTIES SO THE INTRINSIC FIBRES THEMSELVES DETERMINED A LOT OF FUNCTIONALITY FROM THERE MUSCLE FIBRES DON'T CAUS MOVEMENTS MUSCLE FIBRES SIMPLY CONTRACT THEY'RE ALL SURROUNDED WITH CONNECTED TISSUE AND THAT'S ALL SURROUNDED WITH A BUNCH OF MORE CONNECTED TISSUE THAT ALL SURROUND TO DO A MUSCLE THAT MUSCLE IS IN SURROUDED WITH MORE CONNECTED TISSUE THAT ALL COMES TOGETHER INTO A GIANT TENDENT THAT TENDAN ATTACHES TO THE BONE IT'S THE PULLING ON THOSE TENDIN THAT ACTION MOVE THE BONE THE COSTUMEAND MOVEMENT SO THAT'S ARYAU THREE ARY ONE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM ARYA TWO THE MUSCLE CONTRACTIONARY THREE SOME SORT OF CONNECTIVE TISSUE THING CHANGE IS HAPPEN AT ALL THREE UP THOSE LEVELS AND WE'RE NOT EVEN NOW TALKING OR EVEN  ENTER THE DISCUSSION OF BOU MECHANICS THAN YOU CHANGED SAY THE PENATIAN ANGLE OF THE MUSCLE WHICH IS THE ANGLE AT WHICH THE MUSCLE FIBRES LAY RELATIVE TO THE BONE RIT SO THIS IS BAS IF MECHANICS AS IT PULLING PERPENDICULAR TO THE BONE IS A PULLING HORIZONTAL TO THE BONE OR SOME SORT OF ANGLE ALL OF THESE THINGS DO TERMANE HUMAN PERFORMANCE SO WHENYOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AGAIN THAT STRENGTH DEVELOPMENT YOU CAN SEE TREMENDOUS IMPROVEMENTS IN TOTAL FORCE PRODUCTION BY MANIPULATING ALL OF THOSE AREAS AND YOU HAVE NOT TOUCHED CHANGES IN MUSCLE SIZE IF YOU CHANGE MUSCLE SIZE IN A TRUE SUSTAINED FASHION WHETHER THIS IS SORCAOL PLASMIC OR CONTRACT AL PROTINES YOU HAVE GIVEN YOURSELF MORE OPPORTUNITY TO PRODUCE MORE FORCE IT DOESN'T GUARANTEE YOU PRODUCE MORE FORCE I BODY BUILDERS ARE NOT STRONGER THAN POWER LITERS YOU VEN KNOW THEY HAVE MORE MUSCLE BUT BODY BUILDERS ARE PROBABLY STRONGER THAN MOST PEOPLE SO THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MUSCLE SIZE AND STRENGTH ITS IN THIS NOT A ONE TO ONE GUARANTEED RATIO AND THAT'S GENERALLY BECAUSE THE ALTHOUGH THE MUSCLE HAS BEEN AIDED THEY MAY HAVE NOT CHANGE THE BOU MECHANICAL CONSIDERATIONS AY MAY I'M NOT CHANGE THE CONNECTED TISSUE NOR THE NERVOUS SYSTEM SO AND SO THAT'S WHY WE SEE THIS GIANT RELATIONSHIP THAT OUR VALUE IS PRETTY HIGH BETWEEN STRENGTHAN AND PERTRY BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET TO THE ENDS OF IT IT'S NOT AND THAT MATTERS TO YOUR ACTUAL QUESTION TEN MINUTES AGO BECAUSE AGAIN YOU CAN TRAIN STRENGTH DAILY ON THE SAME MUSCLE BUT IF YOU WANT TO ALLOW FOR THAT PROCESS OF CONNECT A CONTRACT ILE PROTINES TO TO ADD AND GRROL THEN YOUVEN A HAVE TO LLOW SOME RECOVERY BECAUSE IF YOU GO BACK INTO THAT MUSCLE TOO SOON YOU CAN HAVE BLUNT THE RESPONSE YOU GEN A STOPIC AN A CUT IT OFF YOU HAVE ALL KINDS OF OF PROBLEMS GOING ON IN THE CELL THAT ARE GOTIN IM JUST ATTENUATE THAT THAT GROWTH RESPONSE SO I GAVEYOU THE ANSWER FOR STRENGTH TRAIN THE ANSWER FOR A PERTIFY IS PROBABLY LESS THAN THREE OUT A TEN ON LEVEL OF SORENESS YOU CAN GO AGAIN IN GENERAL YOU'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AT SEVENTY TWO HOURS IS THE OPTHMA WINDOW SO IF YOU TRAINED YOUR YOUR SHOULDERS ON MONDAY YOU PROBABLY W DN'T ON A TRAIN IN BAGAIN ON TUESDAY IF I PERCHIFIES AGO MAYBE WEDNESDAY MAYBE THURSDAY'S BEST SO SOMETHING LIKE AN EVERY TWO TO THREE DAY WINDOW IS IS PROBABLY AND WE DON'T WE LIVE IT MORE NOW ABOUT WHY THAT IS THE GENE CASCADE THE SIGNALING RESPONSE HAPPENS WILL THE SIGNALING HAPPENS INSTANTANEOUSLY RIGHT WITHIN SECONDS THE GENE CASADE IS PROBABLY IN THEM PEEPED IN THE FOUR HOUR WINDOW LIKE THE DEPENDING ON WHICH GENE YOU WANT AO LOOK AT BUT IS THIS KIND OF A SNAP SHOT BUT THE PROACHING SENTHES'S PROCESS IS TWENTY FOUR TO FORTYEIGHT HOUR THING AND SO IT TENDS HE CINT OF LOOK LIKE LET THAT THING FINISH AND LET THAT SIGNAL GO BACK THE BASE LINE AND THEN HAD IT AGAIN AND THEN HEAD IT AGAIN AND NOWS LONG AS YOU'RE PROVIDING THE NEUTRIANS THE RECOVERY SHOULD HAPPEN AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THE SAME WORK OUTPUT IN THE TRAINING SESSION SO THE STIMULAS STAYS HIGH AND THE RECOVERIES THER R AND YOU CAN NOW CONTINUE TO GROW MOSTLE YOU MENTION FORTY EIGHT TO SEVENTY TWO HOURS FOR HYPERTROPHY WHAT IF BE FOR WHATEVER REASONS ATHE THE TRAINING SPLIT A LIFE STYLE FACTORS ET CETERA SOMEBODY SAY LET'S USE YOUR EXAMPLE TRAINS A SHOULDERS ON MONDAY AM IDEALLY THEY WOULD TRAIN THEM AGAIN ON THIRSDAY IN THEER PARTICULAR INSTANCE SOMEWHERE WEDNSDAY OR THURSDAY BUT THEY DON'T THEY WAIT UNTIL SATURDAY OR SUNDAY FOR WHATEVER REASON MAYBE IT'S MORE COMPATIBLE WITH THEIR WORK WORK ANOTHER EXERCISE SCADUAL WHATEVER THE REASON ARE THEY ACTUALLY LOSING HYPERTROPHY THAT THEY GAINEDWHER THEY MISSD  A  WINDOW TO INDUCE FURTHER HYPERTROPH IT'S PROBABLY BETTER THINK ABOUT THE LATTER IT'S NOT THAT YOUR  LOST IT SUCEYUVE JUST COME LOST AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO MAKE MORE PROGRESS IM I WILL SAVE YOU A LITTLE BIT AND CAN I GOING BACK TO YOUR HIT PROGRAMM THIS IS THE ORIGINAL HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING THA THE MENSE ARE THING RIGHT IT IS NOT THE HIT WITH ONE EYE NOT THE HIGH INTENSILY INTERVAL TRAINING BUT HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING AT RE ONE SET TO ABSOLUTE FAILURE TO MAYBE TOO FOR EACH MUSS THE GROUP TWENTY MEN AT WORK OUT DIVIDING YOUR BY IN THE THREE INTO A THREE WAY SPLIT AND THEN LITERALLY TRAINING MY ASHING SIX TIMES A MONTH WHICH MUST BE WOULD THINK THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY THERE'S NO WAY THAT'S GON O WORK AND I CAN TELL YOU IT IF YOU ARE UNTRAINED YOU YOU GROW LIKE A WEED JUST IF YOU TRAIN HARD ENOUGH EVEN I R TRAINED LOOK AT THE PEOPLE MIKE TRINED HE PUT A LOT OF BODY BUILDERS ON REALLY HIGH LEVELS NOW THEY HAD THE SAME SIMILAR HELP YOU HAD AT THAT TIME FOR ANY WAY TO BE VERY CLEAR I WAS NOT AE FA HAS OTHONISS AND ABOT IN FACT I W AINESS WAS JUST AS GOOD II PROBABLY WAS I WAS IT MEASURING MY LEVELS THERE BUT I PROBABLY WOULD I GREW EASY AND GENE IN GENERAL ITEND TO GROW PRETTY EASILY AM FROM WAIT TRAINING BUT THEED BUT AN I SHOULD SAY THAT TO MIKE'S CREDIT AND I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE TAT HE WAS THE ONE WHO REALLY SAID LOOK UNUNLES YOU'E GONG TO MAKE A PROFESSIONAL CAREER OUT OF IT YEDO NOT RUN THE HEALTH HAZARDS OF EXAGENOS MORMONS IT YOU KNOW IT' CERTILY NOT AT YOUR AGE SO HE DETURRED ME FROM THAT WHICH WAS GREAT BECAUSE IT NEVER ENTERED MY MIND IT JUST WAS ONE O THOSE THINGS WHERE I MIHT MENCER SAID DON'T DO IT AND HE CLEARLY DONE IT RIGHT I'M SOE SPEAKING FROM AN INFORTANED PLACE IT NEVER ENTERED MY MIND BUT ALSO I WAS WHAT WAS REALLY WILD AS I WAS CONTINUING TO RUN ACROSS COUNTRY A AND SO THERE WAS IT THERE WAS A A TRAIDE OFF THERE AT SOME POINT OF BIT NOR WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG YOU CAN GET MANY PEOPLE CAN GET AWAY WITH TO WITH WHAT AT THIS AGE WOULD SURELY PLACE ME INTO A STATE OF OVERTRAINING EVEN AT LOW VOLUME WAL YET WELL I MEAN LIKE THE THE WHOLE FIELD ON INTERFERENCE EFFECT HAS CHANGED QUITE A BIT I RECENTLY WHIGE WE CAND COME BACK TO IF YOU ONT I'M BUT DISTANT TO FINISH OUT THE THE IDO HERE WIT THAT LAST QUESTION IM IF YOU WANT TO TAKE FIVE DAYS OR SIX DAYS FON BETWEEN EACH MOSSGROUP YOU CAN DO THAT FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE RESEARCH IT'S GON TO SHOW THAT FREQUENCY IS NOT AT IMPORTANT IT WILL SOMETHING IT'S UNIMPORTANT BUT IT'S IF YOU CAN HANDLE CHANGES AS LONG AS YOU GET TO THE SAME TOTAL VOLUME SO YOU CAN DO THAT YOU JUST HAVE TO DO A LOT MORE WORK IN THAT ONE WORK OUT IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE SIX WEEK EIGHT WEEK THING YIF YOU'RE LIKE I'M IN THIS FOR THE NEXT SIXTY YEARS IT'S PROBABLY O KE RI I'M BUT IT CAN BE THERE THAT THE CHALLENGE WITH SPLITTING UP YOUR TRAINING SESSIONS FOR IPERTROPY INTO SMALLER NUMBERS LIKE ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK IT'S JUST DIFFICULT TO GET THAT NUMBER IT'S TYPICAL TO GET THAT VOLUME DONE I'M VOLUME WISE THE MORE RECENT MEDANALYSIES AREGOING TO SAY THAT YOURE PROBABLY LOOKING OUT AROUND TEN WORKING SETS PERMUSSEL GROUP PER WEEK SEEMS TO BE COTT THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD THAT YOU'RE GON ONE A HAD SO IF YOU DID THREE SETS OF TEN AT YOUR SHOLDERS ON MONDAY THREE SETS OF TEN SHOULDERS WEDNESDAY AND THREE ON FRIN TAT'S NINE WORKING SETS IF YOU WNTED TO DUSE THREE DIFFERENT SHOULDER WORK A EXERCISES ON MONDAY AND HIT YOUR NINE SETS IT'S NOT REALLY ACTING YOU BE DOT MUCH DIFFERENT THE PROBALEM IS TAN IS KIND OF THE MINIMO YOU PROBABLY WANT TA LOOK FOR MORE LIKE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY AND IN FACT WELL TRAINED FOLKS TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THAT BECOMES VERY CHALLENGING IN ONE WORK OUT IFACT DEFUNCULE YOU OCAN BEL TO DO IT RIT AND SO THAT IS WHERE IT'S NOT FREQUENCY THATLOKS LIKE IT KILLS USE TOS UFFECT YOU HAVE GOT TO GET BECAUSE A TOTAL DRIVER OF STRENGTH IS INTENSITY BUT THE TOTAL DRIVER OF HYPERCRVIEW'S VOLUME ASSUMED YOU'RE TAKING IT TO FATIGUE RITER MUSKINE AR FAILURE SO IT'S JUST HAFE TO GET ENOUGH DONE IF YOU CAN I AND IF YOU WANT TO SET YOUR SCENDRUL UP THAT WAY LIKE YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER IF YOU DO THOSE TYPES OF TRAINING SESSIONS WHERE YOURE JUST GOIN A COMPLETELY EXHAUST A MUSCLE IT'S GOING TO BE TIT IT'S CAN BE SORE FOR WHILE YOU YOUR YOUR PROB'BLY NOT GOING TO COME BACK AND THAT'S SORE THE LOGIC BEHIND THAT WILL TUST TAKE THE TING TO TREMENDOUS FAILURE AND GIVE IT SIX DAYS FO RECOVER UM IT CAN WORK IS IS NOT THE BEST I THINK IS ONE OING TO THINK ABOUT FORMOST PEOPLE IT'S ALSO HARD TO DO THOSE WORK OUTS WITHOUT A TRAINING PARTNER IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DO THEM GRAND STIMULANS AND HEADPHONES AND ALL KINDS OF OTHERS TEAR WELL AWAY THE YE STIMULANTS ARE NOT I DON'T CERTAINLY DON'T RECOMMEND THOSE UM IT MAYBE A CUP OF COFFEE R TO IF THAT'S YOUR THING BUT IM AND MAYBE SOME OF THE SAFE FOR SUPPLEMENTS BUT CERTAINLY NOT YOU SORTS OF STIMULANTS THAT THE GUISES IN THE SEVENTIES AND EGHTYES OR NOING ITS OR SILL ISE OR STILL USE A YOU TALKED ABOUT REPETITION RANGES BROADLY FOR STRAIN TRAINING SO FIVE OR LESS YEYOU SAID FREQUENCY COULD BE AS OFTEN AS EVERY DAY YET REST TWO TO FOUR MINUTES MAYBE EVEN LONGER IF YOU'RE GOING FOR ONE REPETITION MAXUM FOR HYPERTRPHE SIR WHAT ARE THE REPETITION RANGES THAT ARE EFFECTIVE AND WHAT ARE THE ONES THAT ARE MOST EFFECTIVE IF ONE IS TRYING TO MAXIMISE SOME OF THE OTHER VARIABLES LIKE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO SPEND MORE THAN AN HOUR TO SEVENTY FIVLIN ITS IN THE GIM BECAUSE I THINK THAT A WHILE THE RERANGES MIGHT BE QUITE BROAD AS YOU LUDE TO EARLYER THERE'S THE PRACTICAL THERE ARE THE PRACTICAL CONSTRAINTS YE SO WHAT WHAT REPET ITION RANGE IS OR PER CENT OF ONE RE PETITION BAXIM OM IM SHOULD PEOPLE CONSIDER ONE THING ABOUT HYPR RIT I'M THE QUICK ANSWER THERE IS ANYWHERE BETWEEN LIKE FIVE TO THIRTY RAPS PER SET THAT'S GOING TO SHOW ACROSS LITERATURE PRETTY MUCH EQUAL I BIRCH FEGANES I'M AND WE CAN HAVE AREALLY INTERDISCUSSION ABOUT WHY THAT IS BUT I'M JUST REMEMBERING ONE THING FROM A SECOND A GO IT I WAT TO GIVE A BETTER ANSWER FOR THE REQUENCY YOU CAN DO EVERY SINGLE WEEK FOR STRENGTH AR EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR STRENGTH IF YOU WANT THOUGH LIKE WHAT'S PROBABLY MENTABLLY VIABLE TO TWICE FOR WEEK PERMUSCLE SO HAMSTRINGS STRANG TWICE WEEK THAT THAT'S A GOOD NUMBER TO GET MOST PEOPLE REALLY STRONG YOU CAN DO EVERY SINGLE DAY YOU DON'T NEED TO O SO I WHI WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I WASN'T SAYING YOU HAVE TO TRAIN A MUSCLE EIGHT IF I PER CENT EVERY SINGLE DAY TO GET STRONG TWO IS A GOOD NUMBER THREES GREAT BUT PROBABLY EVEN TOO IS REALLY EFFECTIVE GOT IT THIS EXPLAINS TO THE HIGH FREQUENCY OF OF TRAINING FOR STRANGTH ATHLETS THAT'S ALWAYS MYSTIFIED ME YOAD THE VERY LONG WORK OUT TO MAKE SENSE PEK IS VERY LONG NEVER NAVEN' TRAIN TWICE A DAY EVEN THITTLE SQUAT IN THE MORNING SQUAT IN THE AFTERNOON EVERYDAY WITH THEY'RE EATING IN THEIR SLEEPING THE PO DO'T HAVE TIME FOR ANYTHING ELSE LAT'S WEATHER PROSE SO THAT'S A JOB RIGHT THAT' WHAT THEY DO I'M SO  AP YOUR I PERCHAPY I'M STRENGTH TRAINING PROGRAMMING ITIS SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED BECAUSE OF THAT'S NOT THE DANGER BUT YOU CAN HAVE TO PAY ONE WAY OR THE OTHER RIGHT THE RISK IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER CAS HE LOADS HIGHER AND YOU HAVE TO BE LITTLE MORE TECTICALLY PROFICIENT WHEN IT COMES TO HYPERTRE TRAINING THE WAY I LIKE EXPLAIN IT IS IT'S KONDI IDIOT PROOF THE PROGRAMMING IS IDIOT PROOF THE WORK IS HARD THOUGH SO YOUE USUAL RANGE ANYWHERE BETWEEN YOUR FIVE REPS AN THIRTY CAN YOU GET' SOMEWHERE N THERE PERFECT IT'S ALL EQUALLY EFFECTIVE YOU CAN'T SCREW THAT UP THE ONLY CAVIAT FOR HYPERCRBY IS YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT TO MUSCULAR FAILURE AND YOU NEED ENOUGH REST FOR THE ADAPTATION AND PROCINGSENSIS IT OCUR YEN IF YOU RECOVER FASTER YOU CAN MAY BE DOIT MORE FREQUENTLY AND IF YOU DON'T MAY BE LESS FREQUELT AND BY THAT LOGIC SHOULD PEOPLE PERHAPS EXPERIMENT AND FIGURE OUT WHAT REPETITION RANGE ALLOWS THEM TO RECOVER AM IN CONCERT WITH THE TRAINING FREQUENCY THAT THEY CAN DO CONSISTENTLY MY RECOMMENDATION IS I THINK YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY SET YOUR A USE THE REPETITION RANGE AS A WAY TO HAVE SOME VARIATION BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO GO IN THO GEMITY THREE SEXTEND HE GANTO GET VERY BORNE VERY QUICKLY AND SO I I THINK YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY INTENTIONALLY CHANGE THE REPT SCHEMES FOR SIMPLE SAKE OF HAVING MORE FUN IT IS A VERY DIFFERENT CHALLENGE THE MECHANISMS THAT ARE IN DUCING HIG PERCHBY ARE DIFFERENT BUT THERE'S ONLY A MAXIMEL MONIGROWTH THAT ONE CAN GET RIGHT AND SO YOU HAVE AS BEST WE THINK IT NOW AND AND SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY WELL THE SPOWS THAT WE KNOW REALLY CLEARLY ABOUT THE MECHANISMS OF MOSLIPERCH  WE DON'T IT IT'S STILL VERY MUCH A GUESSING GAME BUT THE THREE MOST LIKELY DRIVERS ARE ONE METABALLIC STRESS TWO MECHANICAL TENSION AND IN THREE MUSCULAR DAMAGE YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ALL THREE ONE IS SUFFICIENT YOU CAN HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF ONE OR TWO AND YOU CAN CON IT SE YOUGET IT TO PLAY HERE WEV WERE T TALKED ABOUT THE MUSCULAR DAMAGE A GAN IT'S VERY CLEAR MORE DAMAGE IS NOT BETTER BUT IT IS SOME WHAT A DECENT PROXY RIGHT LIKE U GET A LITTLE BIT OF SORNASS IS GOOD YOUS DON'T GET SO SORTS COMPROMISING YOUR TOTAL VOLUME RIT A MECHANICAL TENSION IS CONTALIC STRENGTH THIS IS WHY IF YOU DO EVEN SUCH A FIVE OR EIGHT AND YOUR CONICLOSES THAT STRENGTH EN YOU WILL GAIN A LITTLE BIT A MUSCLE NOT OPTIMAL MUSCLE GAIN BUT YOU'RE GINGTO GAIN SOME BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN THESE MY PHYSIOLOGY ISN'T CUT OFF AT FOUR RAPS AND THEN FIVE RAPS IS AT DIFFERENT THING RIGHT IT'S IT'S ALWAYS A BLEND SO THINK OF IT AS LIKE A A FADING CURVE AND YOU GET CLOSER TO THE END IT FADES LESS EFFECTIVE AS YOU GET CLOSER TO THE MIDDLE IT'S MORE EFFECTIVE ANYWHERE BETWEEN EIGHT REP'S PER SET THE THIRTY IT'S EQUALLY EFFECTIVE PAST THIRTY IT'S GEN A BLEND OUT PAST EIGHT TE FIVE TO FORTO THREETSCEN A BLEND WE KNOW LESS OR THERE SO METABLE EXTRESS IS EN THE DAMAGE IS THE OTHE OR SARRY ME CANICAL TENSION IS THE ONE THAT'S HEAVY A MUSCLE DAMAGE YELE ONE A THIRD ONE IS METABLE EXTRESS AND THIS IS IM I GET A E BIT OF AN AIRY OF SCIENTIFIC CONTENTION BUT SOMETHING'S THERE I KNOW SOMETHINGS THERE WE JUST WERE JUST CONT OF FUMBLING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT EXACTLY IT IS AND THIS IS METABALE EXTRESS IS THE BURN RIGHT IT IT'S THERE I IT'S WHY BLOOD FLOW RESTRICTION TRAINING PROBABLY WORKS THAT'S DONE VERY LIGHT SER NO MECHANICAL TENSION THERE'S VERY LITTLE DAMAGE BUT SOMEHOW IT INDUCES A GO AT AMOUNT OF HYPERTROPHY VERY PAINFUL YULY BOY I TRIED THIS I 'VE A FRIEND FORER SPECIHAL OPERATOR WHO UM WAS ON THE EAST COAST AND TOOK ME THROUGH A BLOOD FLO RESTRICTION IM TRAINING PROTOCALLIN AT HARKEN I I DON'T THINK I I ACTUALLY CRIED WHAT O PROBABLY BUT I MIGHT HAVE CRIED OUT ONCE OR TWICE IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE ESPECIALLY THE LOWER BODY MOVEME YES I NOW WAS A HUMID DAY I'LL CLAIM AWILL BIT A GELT NO BUT NO IT WAS BRUTAL IT WAS REALLY BRUTAL AND I OL OT TE BEST YEAR YOUR LIFE IN STILL BRUTLE OKE WELL THAT MANES WE FEEL LOV IT BETTER IT WAS INTENSE I AND IM AND A PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO USE THE PROPER CUFFS FOR THESE THINGS I DON'T HAVE ANY A RELATIONSHIPTANING THE COMPANIES TAT SELL THESE CUFFS BUT THE REASON IS THAT YASHLY EED TO BLOCK PARTICULAR AVENUES A BLOOD FLOW YOU CAN'T SIMPLY SINCH OWFUL MUSCLE WEU CAN'T TURNIC GET A MUSCLE AND TRAIN NOT A G CAN ACTUALLY I KILL YOURSELF THAT WAY I AN GT BOODCLOT YET YOU AND IM SO IF YOUR INTEREST IN BLOODFLOW RESTRICTION TRAIN AIMAGINE YOU HAVE SOME CONTENT ABOUT THIS OR WILL AT SOME POINT BUT ALSO THERE THERE ARE RESOURCES ON LINE THAT PEOPLE CAN ET OUT YET A A QUESTION ABOUT HYPERTROPHY TRAIN I THINK UM MANY PEOPLE ARE WONDERING ABOUT TRAIN TO FAILURE OR DON'T TRAIN TO FAILURE ASSUMING GOOD FORM YE ASSUME A GOOD FOM GREAT IM THE ANSWER IS BOTH SO YOU WANT A TRAIN TO FAILURE BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO GO TO EXTREME FAILURE SO YOU DON'T NEED TO NECESSARILY GO TO THAT LIKE A PARTNER HAS TO LIFT THE BARBLE OFF MY CHEST BUT YOU HAVE TO GET CLOSE YOU HAVE TO DRIVE EITHER HEAVY STRESS DAMAGE RIGHT OR OR PUMP AND SO I REALLY EASY PRACTICALL TO THINK ABOUT THIS SUN I HEARD MIKE IS YOUR TELL RUNS COMING ON RETISENCE PEURTIZATION YEARS AGO OUT LINE THIS AT A AND I SEE  TALK AND IT WAS BEAUTIFUL I THUGT THIS IS A MOST ELOQUENT WAY TO EXPLAIN THE CONTEXT ABOUT TRAINGRI PIRCHFE SO ONLY TOLOOK FOR THREE THINGS IN YOUR WORK OUT AND LET'S SAY THT YOUEL HOW ON A PARTICULAR MUSCLE TO GROW THAT'S SAY YOU HAT YOUR GLUTES TO GET LARGER O  WHEN O'RE DOING YOUR GLUED EXERCISES NOWVER ONE ARE YOU FEELING THE GLUE TO CONTRACT OOK AE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THERE BUT THAT'S A GOOD SIGN IF IT IS OK A LET'S SAY I DIDN'T REALLY FEEL MY GLUE CONTRACT I FELT IT MORE MY CLODS OR MY BACK O KE DID YOU FEEL A BIG PUMP AFTERWARDS NOW I DN'T RALLY TO A PUMP THERE EITHER WORDS ORDERING O GA GRIGT O'M WITH THREE  NEXT DAY DID YOU FEEL LITTLE BIT OF SORENESS THERE AT ALL NO I DIDN'T WEL TAT'S A VERY GOO INDA CATRE DIDN'T FEEL IT DURIN THE WORK OUT YOU FELT NO SORT OF PUMP AND IT DIDN'T GET SORE DON'T EXPECT MUCH GROWTH DIDN'T HAS TRIBUTED THE WORK ACROSS A BUNCH OF MUSCLE GROUP SO ALLJUST LIKELY OTHER MUSCLE GROUPS WERE TOO INVOLVED RIGHT ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE LIKE NO BUT MAN MY BACK OT REALLY SO WEL THAT'S A REALLY GOOD INDICATION OF TELLING YOU WHAT THE HELL WAS MOVING AND SO IN TERMS OF TARGES IF YOU WERE TO PUT I GET A ONE TA YOU TEN SCALE HOW MUCH SHOULD I FEEL IT BURNING DURING ANYTHING LESS THAN A THREE KATE'S PROBABLY NOT DOING MYTRAY BUT IT DOESN'T LIKE SEVEN IS NOT A TEN IS NOT BETTER THAN SEVEN YOU NEED TO FEEL IT BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE WHOLE MY GOSH I'M DYING HERE SORNUS SAME BAROMETER RIGHT SO IF YOU CAN GET LIKE THREE THREE AND THREE YOU'RE PROBABLY IN A PRETTYGOOD SPOT FIVE FIVE AND FIVE IS MAY BE BETTER BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO GO MUCH PAST THAT SO I WANT YOU TO FEEL THE MUSCLE GROUP EITHER WORKING OR IF YOU LIKE I DIDN'T FEEL E MUCH WHEN YOU REY TO PUMP THE NEXT DAY GOT REALLY SORE THEN YOUE GOUR STILL YOU KNOING ONT A GOOD PATH I I GAIN REALLY SORE IS IN LIKE WHO LITTLE TENDER BUT NEXT DAY IT'S OKEY THEY AFTER THAT I COULD IKE OUL TRAIN NO PROBEB THAT'S REALLY WHAT YOU WANT TO GO AFTER AND IM TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING IS THIS LIKELY TO PRODUCE SOME GROWTH OR NOT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT VERY CLEAR PERAMETERS AND RECOMMENDATIONS I KNOW A BENEFITING MEN BENEFIT A LOT OF PEOPLE IF YOU BE WILLING TO THROW OUT A FEW SORT OF SETS IN T E RET PERAMETERS THAT COULD A ACT IS BROAD GUIED LINES OP PEOPLE WHO WANT TO A EXPLORE FURTHER IT I REALIZE THAT WITH ALL THESE MODIFIABLE VERIABLES THAT THERE'S NO ONE IZES FIT'S ALL FOR STRENGTH I LOVE THIS FIVE TO THIRTY FOR HIPURTROPHY THA  BUT O THING DON'T THIN I'VE EVER DONE A THIRTY REPS AT OF ANYTHING BUT BUT NOW THAT YOU'VE HROWN THAT OUT THAT I SEE IT IS A BIT ON AT ALL IN POSSUM ABOUT THIRTY YOU'REGING TO GET AN INSANE PUMP YOU GET A BURN LIKE CRAZY BUT YOU WON'T GET SUPERSORE AS OM CAN TENTIONS TOLOT SO LOW IT'S SO LIGHT SO YOU YOU CAN YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH THOSE THINGS AND YOU IT'S HARD BECAUSE YOUR MIND IS GO WONDER YOU D GET IT LIKE REPTWIING YOU' MA COME DONE AND YOU' LIKE NOW THERE'S THERE'S A LOT LEFT HERE TO GET THIRTY WERE LIKE A SET OF TEN IS IS MUCH EASIER LIKE YOU JUST LIKE O QITOOM MORE TOOMORE SAT THIRTY'S LIKE I GOT SIXTEEN MORE S IT'S AWFUL BUT YOU'RE NOT COUNTING IS WORK IT'S TOT TAIR PRI AND PEOPLE TEND O DIS KIND ON LIKE CHECK OUT SO THIRTY'S POSSIBLE BUT ALITTLE BIT EXCRAME EXTREME  BUT IW'LD RECOMMEND A ALL OF EM THAT IT'S A REALLY FUN PLAT YOU CAN DO DIFFERENT IN THE SAME WORK OUT TWO BY THE WAY LIKE YOU CAN DO ONE SET OF TEN A PUSH UPS AND THEN TAKE LITLE BREAK AND THEN TO A SET OF TWENTY FINE LEY YOU CAN YOU CAN MIX IN MASC THESE THINGS I'M THERE'S NO MAGIC RECIPY THAT HAS TO HAPPEN FOR ALL THOS OR DO IT DIFFERENT SO MONDAYS ARE MY SETS TO TEN DAYS WEDNESDAYS ARE MY SET OF TWENTY DAYS AND FRIDAYS ARE MY SET A THIRTY DAYS AND YOU CAN HAVE ALL KINDS OF FUN THERE AND IT'S HARDESS GREW UP GREAT  THAT PHRASE IS ALWAYS REASSURING SO FOR STRENGTH IS VERY A SETS IN REPS PRO TO CALL THAT YOU HAVE THAT IS A PRETTY SURE FIRE SO WAIT A TO JUST THINK ABOUT A REALLY FAST ANSWER FOR POWER WEILL SPEE POWER INSTRENGTH IS WHAT I OES CALL THETHREE TO FIVE CONCEPT RE I SO PICK THREE TO FIVE EXERCISES IF YOU'RE FEELING BETTER THAT DAY CHOOSE IN THE HIGHER END IF YOU'R FEELING LESS THAT DAY OR YOU HAVE A SHORTER TIME FRAME THE TRAIN GO LESS SO THERES TO BE THREE CETS OR THRE EXERCISES RATHER OR FIVE EXERCISE MOST SO THREE TO FIVE EXERCISES DO THREE TO FIVE REPS THREE TO FIVE CETS TAKE THREE TO FIVE MINUTES REST IN BETWEEN AND DO IT THREE TO FIVE TIMES A WEEK SO THAT CAN BE AS LITTLE AS THREE SETS OF THREE FOR THREE EXERCISES THREE TIMES A WEEK THAT'S THAT'S A TWENTY MEN UTE WORK OUT THREE TIMES A WEEK IT CAN BE AS HIGH AS FIVE SETS OF FIVE FOR FIVE EXERCISES FIVE DAYS A WEEKSO IT'S VERY BROAD AND ALLOWS PEOPLE TO STILL STAY WITHIN THE DOMAINS OF STRENGTH AND POWER WHILE STILL BEING ABLE TO MOVE AND CONTOR TOR THEIR LIFESTYLE AND AN SORENESS AND TIME IN ALL THOSE THINGS THE ONLY DIFFERENTIATOR TO PAY ATTENTION TO BETWEEN POWER AND STRENGTH IS INTENSITY SO IF YOU WANT STRENGTH THIS IS NOW EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT BLUSS OF YOUR MACX RIM IF YOU WANT POWER IT NEEDS O BE A LOT LIGHTER CAUSE YOU NEEDN'T BE MOVE MORE TOWARDS THE VELOCITY AND THE SPECTROM BECAUSE POWER IS STRENGTH MULTIPLIED BY SPEED SO WHILE GETTING STRONGER BY DEFINITION CAN HELP POWER YOU PROBABLY WANT TO SPEND MORE OF YOUR TIME IN THE FORTY PER CENT TE SEVENTY PER CENT RAINGE LIKE PLUSTER MINUS SO THAT'S IT BOTH TEM CONCEPTS WE THE WORK EVERYTHING ELSE THE EXERCISE THE REPS THE THE FREQUENCY ALL THAT CAN BE STILL IN THE TREE TO FIVE RANGE JUST CHANGE THE INTENSITY DEPENDING ON WYSHOUT COME YOU ON THE NERVOUS SISTEM OBVIOUSLY PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLL AT THE LEVEL OF NERVES CONTROLLING THE CONTRACTION O MUSCLE FIBRES BUT OF COURSE WE HAVE THESE UPPER MOTOR NER ONS WHICH ARE THE ONES A RESIDE IN OUR BRAIN THAT CONTROL THE LOWER MOTOR ONS THE CONTROL MUSCLE AND THIS TAKES US INTO THE REALM OF WERE THE MIND IS AT DURING AU PARTICULAR MOVEMENT AND TO ME THIS IS NOT AN ABSTRACT THING I CAN IMAGINE DOING WORK OUTS THAT ARE MAINLY FOCUSSED ON STRANGTH ER MAINLY FOCUST ON HYPERTROPHY AND IN THE CASE OF STRENGTH AN MI TRYING TO MOVE WAITS AND WHEN I'M TRYING TO GENERATE HYPERTROPHY IT MIT TRYING TO QUOT IN UOT CHALLENGE MUSCLES IN OTHER WORDS IF I JUST TRYING TO MOVE AWAIGHT AWAY FROM MY BODY O YOU PUSH PUSHING A BENCH PRESS OR AN OVERHEAD PRESS I DON'T KNOW THAT I WANT MY MIND THINKING ABOUT THE CONTRACTION OF MY MEDIAL DEALTS I THINK I WANT MY MIND IN GETTING THE WEIGHT OVERHEAD WITH THE BEST PROPER FORM BEST EXCUSE ME AND PROPER FORM AND CERTAINLY WITH HYPERTRAVY TRAINING BEST IMPROPER FORM I'S GOING TO BE THE TARGET AS WELL BUT THAT SIMPLE OR I SHOULD SAY SUBTLE MENTAL SHIFT CHANGES THE PATTERNS OF NERVE FIBRE RECRUITMENT SO CAN WE SAY TO GET STRONGER FOKCUSS ON MOVING WEIGHTS STILL WITH PROPER FORM AND SAFELY AND TO GET HYPERTROPHE FOKUS ON CHALLENGING MUSCLES STILL WITH PROPER FORM AND SAFELY IT'S VERY FAIR YEAS IS A SNAPD ON ANSWER IT IS A VERY FIR THING TO THINK ABOUT IM INTENTIONALITY MATTERS FOR BOTH IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU LOOK AT SOME INTERESTING SCIENCE HAS BEEN DONE ON POWER DEVELOPMENT AND SPEED DEVELOPMENT THE INTENT TO MOVE IS ACTUALLY MORE IMPORT THN THE ACTUAL MOVEMENT BLOCITY SO IF IF YOU'RE DOING SAY SOMETHING FOR POWER OR STRENGTH AND YOU'RE DOING JUST ENOUGH TO GET THE BARE UP THAT WILL RESULT IN LESS IMPROVEMENTS IN STRENGTH THAN EVEN IF YOURE MOVING AT THE EXACT SAME SPEED BUT YOU'RE INTENDING TO MOVE FASTER AND THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY GOOD COACHING MATTERS SO IF YOUARE COACHING ENOUGHI THROUGH A POWER WORK OUT OSPECIALLY AND THEY'RE DOING ENOUGH TO JUST LIFT FIFTY PER CENT THE WONDER AT MAX IT'S NOT GOING TO GENERATE AS MUCH SPEED DEVELOPMENT AS THEM TRYING TO MOVE THAT BAR AS FAST TI CAN'T EVEN IF THE NET RESULT IS A SAME MYR BYVELOCITY TERMS OUT NERVES MATTER THAT'S I MEN I A SI I SAY AMAZING BUT AS A NERSANTIS IF I SAY AMAZING THE NERVES MAR WHAT'S AMAZING TO ME IS WTIF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT EVEN IF THE BAR IS MOVING AT THE SAME SPEED SAME WAIGHT YEUIF MY INTERNAL REPRESENTATION MY THOUGHTS ARE I'M TRYING TO MOVE THIS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE YOUVERSES I'M JUST TRYING TO GET THE BAR AWAY FOM ME AND AND GET THE WEIGHT UP I'M GOING TO GET DIFFERENT OUT COMES YET THIS IS QUALITY OF WORKRIGHT THIS IS DID YOU DO ENOUGH TO JUST CHECK OFF THE BOX OR DID YOU ACTUALLY STRIVE FORM ADOPTATION I  SIMILAR CONCEPT ACT YOUR WORKS RIT PERTROPHY IN TERMS OF THERE IS A HANDFUL VERY RECENT STUDIES TAT AV LOOK THAT WILL  CALL THE MIND MUSCLE CONNECTION AND THIS IS DOING THINGS LIKE IMAGINE A BY SEPCREL AND YOU'RE SIMPLY LOOKING  AND WATCHING YOUR BISIPS N YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT CONTRACTING AT HARDER EVEN THOUG YOU EXECUTE THE SAME REPETITIONS AT THE SAME EXACT INTENSITY AND NATIONAL INDICATIONS ARE THE MIND BODY CONNECTION ARE GOING TO RESULT IN MORE GROWTH THEN NOT YOU JUST GAVE UM I AUTHORIZATION FOR FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK AT THEIR MUSCLES PLEAIDING IN THE GIM PLEASE DO YEH OF COURSE RIGHT IS IS BUT THESOLITY IS STILL RULED OUT I'D RATHER YOU LOOK ATYOUR MUSCLES IN YOUR FORM SO I'M FINE OFH IT IM THOSE ARE INITION WE DON'T HAVE A LARGE DEPTH OF RESEARCH TO SUPPORT THAT AND MAY BE SOME SUFF WILL OMING COUNTER BUT IT IT DOES IT MATCHES WHAT FOLKS THOT COMMUNITY OF THE SAME FOR A VERY LONG TIME RI HERE'S ACTUALLY SOME STUFF ON SIMPLY FLEXING AN BETWEEN SO IF YOU VERCING A BODY BL THER THAT THEY'LL DO THEIR SET OF BICE OF CRILLES AND THN E'LL GET OU MA FLEXINAL CHECK ANDTAT THEY'R LITTLY THIS IS ARNALD DID RIGHT THIS IS IF YOU GO BACK TO PUMPING IN IRON WORE COLLEGE WAIT ROOMS I CAN SAY I HE FOR SOME REASON THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT AGE GROUP YE THERE'S A LOT OF CHECKING OF BISEPTS IN COLLEGE WAY ROOMS FOR REASONS THAT ES ESCAPE ME IF YOU EVER INTERACT WITH MY WIFE YO  SHE WILL BE THE FIRST TO TELL YOU I CANNOT WALK PAST A MEROR WITHOUT LIKE CHECK ON SOMETHING OT THAT YOU CAN'T I  CN I CAN'T OK NOT HURT ME LIKE I'M GOT I CANNOT IWELL THEN I'LL BE CAREFUL NOT TO DESPARAGE THEN HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE HYPERCRAP OVUT 'V DISLIKE I'M A MUSCLE GAT SOME ALWAYS LIKE THINKING AND TINKKERING ARY WHATEVER BUT YET IT IS A I THNK IT'S VERY MUCH WORTH YOUR TIME TO DO A HIGHER QUALITY TRAINING SESSION BE MORE INTENTIONAL BE PRESENT THEN JUST EXECUTING THE SAME AS IK WORK OD I THINK THAT'S GLOABLY VERY CLEAR TO BE TO YOUR D VANTAGE SO IF YOU THINKING LIKE I'MIN IT LIKE I DON'T WON T WORK OUT TO DAY I GOT ALL THIS GOING ON OR A TIRED OF WHATEVER I'M JUST GON TO DO THE WORK I NNWAYS GET THROUGH IT OKE IF YOU CAN GO YOU KNOW WHAT THOUGH LIKE I'MAN A COT FIFTEEN MINUTES OUT OF THIS THING H  GET MY HEAD RIGHT I'M A GOOD TOO TWENTY MINUTES OF QUALITY WORK DONE THAT'S THAT'S YOUR BEST OPTION BY FAR YOU ALLUDED TO THE FACT THAT AM EVEN JUST LOOKING ATO PARTICULAR MUSCLE MIGHT A BENEFIT IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER FIBRS YOU CAN RECRUIT OR EXITS POTENTIAL FOR HYPERTROPHY AI'VE HEARD BEFORE AND I CERTAINLY I HAVE EXPERIENCE THAT MUSCLES THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON GENETICS OR O SPORTS THAT ONE PLAYED ET CETERA MUSCLES THAT A WE FIND THAT WE CAN CONTRACT TO THE POINT OF ALMOST THE SLIGHTLY PAINFUL CONTRACTION SEEM TO GROW MORE READILY THAN MUSCLES TAT WE CAN'T RECRUIT VERY EASILY AND IM AND THERE AND THE REAS I MENTION SPORTS THAT WE PLAYED EARLIER AS I'V B  JUST AFTE WATCH YHE OLYMPICS TO SEE THAT YOU SWIMMERS OBVIOUSLY ARE VERY GOODY ENGAGING THEIR LATS AM YOU LOOK THE CHIMNESS THEY SEEM TO BE VERY GOOD ENGAGING EVERYTHING YE AND THEY GO THROUGH A FUGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT DYNAMIC MOVEMENTS THAT EXPLAINS THAT AM SO I FIND THAT YOU KNOW IF PEOPLE SAY OH YOUNW I CAN'T GET STRONGER IN THIS OR MY A WHATEVER BODY PARTY IS WEAK INTERMS OF IIMINABILITY TO ENGAGE HYPERTROPHEA I SEER THAT OFTENTIMES THAT CAN BE BECAUSE OF AN INABILITY TO JECT THAT TO ENGAGE THOSE UPPER MOTOR NER ONS TO DELIBERATELY ISOLATE THOSE MUSCLES IM ARE THER WAYS THAT PEOPLE CAN LEARN TO I ENGAGE PARTICULAR MUSCLE GROUPS MORE EFFECTIVELY OVER TIME FORSAKE OF HYPERTROPHY OR STRENGTH OR FOR CASES OF TRYING TO OVERCOME INJURY POTENTIAL OR INJURY BECAUSE IN BALANCE ALS AR BAD I ACROSS THE BOARD YET THIS IS ACTYU VERY COMMON AND I THINK EVERY ONE IS PROBLING ON TO THIS THERE'S SOME PART THAT YOU JUST CAN'T GET GOING FOR ME THAT WAS LATS THAT WAS A R ENBOYD SO MY BACK MUSCLES FOR YEARS I COULDN'T ACTIVATE MY LATS OR MY RONBOYS SEZE THE THE MUSCLE GROUPS THAT CONNECT YOUR SHOULDER BLADES O SHRUT A SQUEEZE YOUR SHOULDER PLACE TOGETHER THAT SET A MUSCLES THER CULL YOUR RONBOYDS I'M YOUR LATS OF COURSE OR MORE VERTICAL AND AND PULL YOUR COT UP AND DOWN A NO MATTER HOW MANY LAT PULL DOWNS I DID BENT ROSE PULL UPSI COULD NEVER SEE ANY DEVELOPMENTHERE NO INCREASEIN STRENGTH AND IT TOOK ME PRUBBY DECADE TO FIGURE OUT HOW THO HELD ACTUALLY GET THESE THINGS ON IN FACT IF YOU'D HAV ASKED ME EVEN IN MY COLLEGERS AS A COLLEGEBL UPLAYER A FLEX YOUR LATS LIKE SHOW ME YOUR LATS YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN NO NO MOVEMENT THERE I'M WHEN I WAS DOING A PULL UP IN THAT PARICULAR CASE THE ONLY WAY I CAN GET THE BAR TO MOVE WAS BE WAS BY USING MY BISEPS I SO SA SENAGIS  MUSCLES SUPPOSE TO BE A SECONDAIRY OR TERTURARY MUSCLE IN THAT MOVEMENT BUT FOR ME IT WAS PRIMER BECAUSE OF MY OVER STRENGTH IN MY BISEPS COMCOUPLED WITH MY LACK OF ACTIVATION IN THE LATS SO YOU'RE COMPANSING THE SAME MOVEMENT ACTUALLY A KIND OF EASYLY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS IMAGINE DOING A BET ROW SO IMAGING YOU'RE YOU'RE BENT OVER COUT OB OUT O FORTY FIVE DEGREE OR HORIZONTAL ANGLE ANDYOU'RE A PULL A A BARBELL TO YOUR BELLY BUTON I NOW YOU CAN ACTUALY DO THAT EXACT SAME MOVEMENT WITH VERY LITTLE BACK MUSCLE ACTIVATION BY SIMPLY FLEXING YOUR ELBOWS MORE AND SO YOU THINK YOU'RE THE BARBOLS GOING ALL THEWAY DOWN AS COMINGALL THEY UP TO TOUCHING MY BELLY AND YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING A GREAT BACK DEVELOPMENT EXERCISE HEN IN FACT BECAUSE OF THE WAY TO YOU'R EXECUTING THE MOVEMENT YOU'RE GTTNG VERY LITTLE BACK DEVELOPMENT AND THIS IS AN A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHY SOMEONE HAS DONE A SPECIFIC EXERCISE MANY MANY MANY TIMES BE AT FAILED TO SEE DEVELOPMENT IN A MUSCLE GROUP WHICH GOES BACK TO EARLIER PART OF OUR CONVERSATION WHICH IS WHY EXERCISES THEMSELVES DO NOT DETERMINE THEADAPTATION IT'S THE EXECUTION THE MATTERS RIGHT IT'S THE TECHNIQUE ET'S THE REP RANGE ALL THOSE ARE GOING TO TERMINE YOUR ACTUAL RESULT SO IF ANY TIME YOU WERE YOUR YOU'RE BANGING YOUR HEAD AGAINST THE WALL AND THINKING LIKE WHY AM I NOT GETTING MOVEMENT HERE GROWTH OR STRANGT WHATEVER IT'S ALMOST ONE OF THOSE IT'S GUARANTEE TO BE ON OF THOSE AREAS RIGHT YOU'R PROBABLY NOT GETTING I'M THE MUSCLE GROUPS TO ACTOV A IN THAT PARTICULAR EXAMPLE JUST BECAUSE WE'RE HERE TRY IIMAGINE DOING THAT BENT RODE INSTEAD OF PULLING THE BARBOL TO YOUR BELLY SQUEEZE YOUR SHOULDER BLADES TOGETHER FIRST AS FAR AS THEY CAN POSSIBLY GO AND THEN BRING YOUR ELBOWS UP WITH OUT CHANGING THE ANGLE OF YOUR ELBOW SO THO WERDS WITHOUT BRINGING YOUR HAND CLOSER YOUR SHOULDER SO KEEP THAT SAME ANGLE COME UP AS HIGH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN AND THEN FINISH OUT THE MOVEMENT THAT'S GOING TO GUARANTEE A A UTILIZATION FIRST OF THE BACK MUSCLES AND A A FINISHING WITH THE BICEPS I'M AT THE END WHICH IS HOW THAT MOVEMENT IS SUPPOSED TO GO SO HOW DO YOU COACH IN TO THAT WELL IT CAN BE A NUMBER OF THINGS WHENEVER I'M DYING NOSING MOVEMENT QUALITY I LOOK FOR A HANDFUL OF THINGS BUT VERY FIRST ONE AS A WARENESS YOU BE SURPRISE HOW MANY FOLKS WHEN YOU SIMPLY TELL THEM THAT MUSCLE GROUP RIGHT THERE AND MAYBE YOU GIVEM A A TACTICAL PROMPT SO YOU TOUCH IT OR YOU PUT SOMETHING AGAINST IT I'M THIS IS ACTUALLY WHY SO IAM JUMPING OVER TH ACE BUT THIS IS WHY ATHINGS LIKE A BELT WORK VERY WELL FOR ACTUALLY INCREASING OF DOMINAL STRANG SO A A MIS CONCEPTION UT THERE AS IF YOU WEAR LIKE A BELT WHEN YOU'RE LIFTING THEN THE BELT CAN A DOES ALL THE WORK FOR YOU IN YOUR ABS GET WEAKER THAT CAN HAPPEN BUT THE EXACT OPPOSITE CAN HAPPEN AS WELL SO IF YOU TAKE A BELT FOR EXAMPLEING AND YOU SENT IT DOWN REALLY TIGHT AND THEN YOU JUST COMPLETELY DISREGARD YOUR MIDSECTION YOU WILL SEE A LOSS OF STRENGTH IN YOUR MIDSECTION BCAUSE NOW THE BELT IS DOING THE WORK BUTF YOU PUT THE BELT ON JUST A LITTLE BIT KIND A TIGHT WERL YU GET SOME CENSORY FEET BACK AND YOU THINK ABOUT USING THAT BELT IS A WAY TO ACTIVEATE THE COR MUSKETURE YOU WILL ACT TO SEE HIGHER AND IF WE LOOK OUT LIKE EN G ACTAVATION THE COR MUSCLES WOULD BE ACTIVEATED HIGHER TO GREATER EXTENT THEN WHEN THE BELT IS OFF BECAUSE A PROPRIORCEPTIVE YE  HUNDRED PERCENT AND FOR THOSE THATI AR WONDERING WHAT PURPRIACEPT IF HE BACK IS PROBYO SET IF YO BACK IS THAT I THEIR NERVES A THAT EXTEND OUT TO THE MUSCLES THAT CONTROL MUSCLE CONTRACTIONS BUT THEN THERE ARE CENSORYIN PUTS FROM THE SKIN AND MUSCLE THAT GO BACK INTO THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IN THOSE WORK AND IN CONCERT AND THAT THAT HE BACK IS PROPRIOCEPTIVE I THING IT IT LITERATELY TRANSLATES TO A KNOWLEDGE OF WEAR ONE'S LIMBS T ARE AND WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THOSE INAMASE YET I'VE AM SEEN I DON'T YOU I DON'T HAVE A TRAINING PARTNER BUT I'VE SEEN A IN JIM'S WEARES SOME WILL BE TRAINING IN SOME ON WOULD TAP THE MUSCLE OF THE PERSON WHO'S DOING THE WORK IN ORDER TO AT WITH THIS IS CONCENTUAL TAPPING OF OTHER PEOPLE'S MUSCLES NOT A WALK AROUND ANY TUCHING PEOPLE'S MUSCLES PLEASE AM THAT TO PROVIDE THAT POPRACEPTIVE FE BACK SO THAT THAT PERSON DOING THE EXERCISES IT BECOMES MORE AWARE OF THE MUSCLE THAT THEYRE SPOST TO BE TRAINING AND IT SEEMS THAT THAT'S PROBABLY AN EFFECTIVE PRACTICE YE A I GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES TOLL GO O THE BACK WITH THAT PULLING MOVEMENT ANDW THEN I'LL STAND THE BELT TREAGLY QUICKLY SO A VERY EASY EXAMPLE THAT YOU CAN DO  RIGHT NOW OW LISTENING ANDI LEARN THIS FROM BRYNE MACKENS HEARE MUTUAL FREND RT SO IF YOU TAKE YOUR HANDS AND OPEN AM UP IM LIKE YOU MAKE AN ELL WITH BOTH YOUR HANDS ND NOW TAKE THOSE AND PUT HEM AROUND YOUR WAIST JUST ABOVE YOUR HIPBONS NOW WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS PRESS OUT AS HARD AS YOU CAN ON YOUR HANDS WITH YOUR CORK AND YOU CAN FEEL A LOT OF CORACTIVATION MOST PEOPLE THINK CORACTIVATION IS THE FRONT OF YOUR STOMACH RIGHT YOUR SIX BACK BUT YOU NEED TO DO AS GREAT A CYLINDER AROUND YOUR BACK SO IT'S THE FRONT IT'S THE SIDE AND IT'S THE BACK SO IF YOU TAKE YOUR TWO FINGERS POINT THEM NOW PUT THEM JUST OUTSIDE YOUR BELLYBUN CAN YOU MOVE YOUR FINGERS WHY JUST MOVING YOUR HADMUSCLES NINETY PER CENT OF PEOPLE CAN SICT DO YES SAME EXACT THING NOW GO TO THAT SAME POSITION JUST ABOVE WAS CALLED YOUR AASIA O YOUR ANTERIOR SUPERIORICS BY RIGHT UP THAT FRONTIER HIPBON RIN THE FRONT CAN YOU NOW MOVE GREAT FIFTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE ARE NOT CNTO GETTY MOVEMENT THERE REALLY TAKE YOUR THUMB AND GO RIGHT ABOVE YOUR PASIES MY WHAT PS IIS POSTERIOR SPERIOT I EXPINE RIGHT NOW CAN YOU MOVE MOST LIKELY NOW SOR RIV I DO A MANY LOW BACK EXTENSION DON'T JUST WITH YOUR CORE MUSCATURE VERILY YE MAYBE IT NIN PRSANTY PEOPLE CAN'T IF YOU CAN'T PERFORM THAT CONTRACTION YOU CAN'T STABLEIGE YOUR SPINE SO ONLY WAIT TO GET STABLIZATION YOU'R SPYINE IS THEN TO GO THROUGH HYPER EXTENSION AND NOW THARE'S A COMPRESSION STRATAGE YOU'R PUTTING IN YOUR SPYINE IT'S BETTER THAN ROUNDING YOUR BACK I CAN GOING FORWARD BUT OVER EXTENSION IS NOT GREAT EITHER SO YOU WONT TO E ABLE TO FLEX THE MUSKETURE IN A CYLINDER FASHION SO YOU HAVE CON CON CONTROL SO IF YOU GO BACK TO OUR VERY FIRST THINGS AND WITH YOUR HANDS OPEN AND YOU PUT IM MY HERE AND IF YOU'RE LIKE I CAN'T GET ACTIVATION IF YOU PAY A TENTION YOUR THUMB RIGHT NOW JUST MOVE YOUR THUM AND NOW YOU SEE ACTIVATION BACK THER RA BON'T NOW IF YOU CAN IMAGINE TURNG THAT ON JUST A LITTLE BIT AND NOW NOTICE HOW I CAN DO THIS BY THE WAY AT THE SAME TIME I'M TALKING IFYOU HAVE TO GO WE DN'T HAE CONTROL RIGHT S YOU HAVE TO BEEL THE SEPARATE BREATH FROM BRACE SO NOW IF I CAN PUT MY POSSESSSELF IN POSITION AND AND KELLY STARIT AS ALWA SAID TWENTY PER SCENT YOU ME TWENTY PER CENT ACTIVATION HERE AND NOW I CAN SQUAT I CAN HINGE I CAN JUMP I DON'T NEEN TO BE LOCK DOWN O ON TO PRER SENT SCREAM TO BE ABLE TO BRACE MY SPINE THAT'S CAN BE IN EFFECTIVE AND WASTEFUL ON TO BE HERE WITH A BELT PROVIDES THAT PROPRA SEPTIVE FEED BACK OREI CAN PUT IT ON TWENTY PER CENT ND IT'S JUSTIS A REMINDER IF I DON'T PRESS AGAINST THE BELT THE BELT SLIDES AND FALLS DOWN A LITTLE BIT IT'S NOT ON SUPERTEIGHT IF IT'S ON SO DANG TIGHT DOING THE WORK AND  FORGET S WE JUST WANT A LITTLE BIT OF FEED BACK THERE SAME THING WITH YOUR UPPER BACK FOR HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME ACTIVATING THOSE ROMBOYS OF THOSE LATS SOMEMON CAN DO A SIMPLE THING WHRE THEY TAKE THEIR FINGER PUT A RIGHT BETWEN YOUR SHOULDER BLATES AND YOU JUST TELL THEM THINGS LIKE HASE SQUEEZE MY FINGER SQUEEZE MY FINGER AS YOU'RE DOING YOUR BENT ROW VER YOUR PULL DOWN YOU CAN TOUCH THE LAT YOU CAN DO I'M JUST VISUALIZATION STUFF SO JUST IMAGINE LIKE A THREE DE RENDERING OF THAT MUSTERGROUP AND YOU'RE WATCHING THAT MUSCERGROUP CONTRACT IT'S VERY POWERFUL AND VERY EFFECTIVE I'M TO DO IT SO A TOUCH AM A VISUAL ALL THE STUFF CAN HELP GET PEOPLE I TO ACTIVATE OUTSIDE OF SIMPLE AWARENESS IM TYPICALLY E CENTRIC OVERLOAD IT'S A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY FOR A ACTIVATION OF A DIFFICULT TO TARGET MUSCLE SO THE LOWERING OF THE BAR OR THE LOWERING OF THE WEIGHT THE MOVEMENT OF THEWAY AWAY FROM THE BODY IT'S NOT A CSSARILY WAS LOWERING CASAT CAN A DEPENDS ON WHATER SURE BY DOING RAT MISS UM THINGS LIKE A PULLUP CASE SO IF IF IF I'M GOING TO DO A PULL UP AND I HAVE POOR LAT ACTIVATION I CAN STILL GET THE PULL OT MUSCLE MOVEMENT EXECUTED BY CONTRACTION OF THE BY SEBSANCE THINGS LIKE THAT HOWEVER TO MAKE THE MOVEMENT SIMPLER I'MW AN TO GOALL THWAY TO TOP SO MAGIN STEPPING ON A BOX OR SOMETHING GOING ALL THE AY TO THAT TOP WITHTOAT PULL OP POSITION AND STARTING FROM THATE I WANT YOU O SIMPLY LOWER IT UNYOUR CONTROL AND SO YU JUST SIMPLY BREAKING THE MOVEMENT DOWN INTO SMALLER PIECES THAT ALLOW YOU TO TO FOCUS ON THE EXECUTION MORE IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT E CENTRICS ARE GREATE FOR STRENGTH DEVELOPMENT VERY GOOD FOR HYPERTRUPY AND ALLOW YOU TO FOLKS ON CONTROL I I I'M WILING TO BET A HUGE PERCENTAGE OF YOU OUT THERE WHO' LIKE I'VE NEVER HAD A SORE LAT YOU NOT DONE A LOT OF PULL UPSAND THINGS LIKE THAT IF YOU DO THAT ESCERNTRIC ONLY YOULL PROBLY WAKE O THE NEXT TING ON OL GAH I FEEL IT THERE AND THAT'S THE SIGN EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T FEEL IT IN THE WORK OUT BUT IT GOT A LITTLE SORE THE NEXT DAY KEEP DOWN THAT PATH AND AN EVENTUALLYOU BE ABLE TO DO A CONCENTRIC MAYBE TAKE A BRAK MAYBE DO AN ICEOMETRIC WE JUST WHOLE THAT POSITION AN EVENTUALLY WORK THAT INTO IT AND TO A PROGRESSION WHERE YOU CAN DO THE CONCENTRIC ES CENTRIC AND HAVE SOME METRIC PORTIONS AND GET ACTIVATION SO THAT THAT MAY TAKE YOU SIX WEEKS MAY TAKE THESE SIX MONTHS BUT THAT'S GENERALY A PRETTY GOOD STRATEGY FOR LEARNING HAW ACT THAY A MUSCLEGRO  TERRIFIC SUGGESTIONS IS IT TRUE THAT E CENTRIC A EMPHASIZED MOVEMENTS MIGHT REQUIRE A LITTLE BIT LONGER RECOVERY ERE THEY LEAD TO MORE SORENESS THAN THECENTRIC MOVEMENTS YET THET THEY TYPICALLY CAN BU THEYRE ALSO HIGHER FORCE OUT BUT SO VERY GOOD FOR STRENGTH DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY'RE GOING TO LEAD ON AVERAGE TWO MORE SORNESS SO MORE PRETENTIAL FOR INTEREST TELL YOU A DESRUPTION THAT IS CAN BE ASSOCIATE WITH PAIN THERE'S THERE'S NOT AS MUCH O PEOPLE WILL LIKE EXPLAIN MUSCLE SORENESS AS A RESULT OF MYCROTRAMA AND MYCROTARES THE MUSCLE THAT CAN HAPPEN BUT THAT'S NOT THE NORM MOST THE TIME IT IS THINGS LIKE DESTRUPTION OF CALCIUM THAT'S GON TO LEAD TO EXCESS OF SWELLING ECESSOF PRESSURE AND THAT'S CING TO BE THEN TRANSLATED AS EXTREME PAINTS THAT'S PROBABLY EXPLAINING MORE MUSCLE SORENESS THEN ACTUALLY MYCROTRAMA RUFIC I WAS GOING TO GET TO BREATHING LATER BUT MAYBE JUST FOR NOW IF WE CAN DO A A A BRIEF UM WE'LL FOY INTO TO BREATHING AS IT RELATES TO WAIT TRAINING IS THERE A A PRESCRIPTIVE FOR HOW TO BREATHE DURING RESISTANCE TRAINING HERE I'M THING WITH WAIGHTS NO NECESSARILY BODY WAIGHT ONLY MOVEMENTS ALTHOUGH I SUPPOSE IT COULD BE THAT APPLIES SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE TIME JUST SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT THE PEOPLE WHAT I WAS TAUGHT AND I'M HOPING YOU CAN TELD ME THIS WAS WRONG BECAUSE THEN THERE MIGHT BE MORE BENEFITS THAT AWAITING ME BUT UM IS THAT I SHOULD EXHALE ON THE EFFORT AN INHALE ON THE LESS SIR EFFORT PORTION OF AN EXERCISE IS THAT TRUE IS THERE A BETTER WAY TO BREATHE THERE IS A BETTER WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT SO NUMBER ONE IF YOU CAN BREATHE AN BRACE IN THIS CONVERSATION GOES AWAY SO YOU CAN MAIN REMAIN A YOU CAN MAINTAIN INTRID MUSCULAR INTRADOMINAL PRESSURE WHI'LL BREATHING THEN I DON'T REALLY CARE WHEN YOU BREATH VERY CHALLINGING TO DO AT VERY HEAVY WAIGHTS IF WE FLAG THIS ON TWO AREAS OF A PARADIME PARADIME ONE OVER HERE YOU'RE GING TO DO A CET OF THIRTY AND YOU  DO FRONT SQUATS WHERE A BARBELL IS SITTING ON YOUR THROAT IF YOU DON'T TAKE ABRATH THIS IS GOING TO AND ONE WAY IN ONE WAY ONLY YOU PASSING OUT CLEARLY HAS TO BE SOME BREATING STRAVITY THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTROM IS LET'S THAY YU CAN I DO A VERTICAL JUMP YOU DON'T NEED ANY AMOUNT OF BREATH THERE IT'S NEVER CAN HAPPEN RIGHT THE QUESTION IS WHAT ABOUT THE MIDDLE D SO I'M DOING SOME SORT OF STRAIN TRAINING THERE WELL NUMBER ONE MAKE SURE YOU'RE BRACE AND THEN YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH LESS NEED TO WORY ABOUT IT I'M IN GENERAL A A DECENT STRATEGY IS TO MAINTAIN A BREATH HOLD DURING THE LOWERING OR ECENTRIC OR MOST DANGEROUS PART OF THE MOVEMENT AND THEN YOU CAN EXAL ON THE CONCENTRIC PORTION SO IF THE BENCH BRESSES ARE EXAMPLE IF YOU HELD IN BRACT LOWERED IN A CONTROL AND NOW START ED THE CONCENTRIC PUSHING AWAY FOR IT AND THEN YOU WANTED TO TAKE AN EXPIRATION DURING THE LAST HALF THE CONCENTRIC PORTION THAT THAT'S ANO CASE TRATEGY IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO A SINGLE REP YOU DO'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT YOU YOU CAN JUST AVOID OR OMIT BREATHING ENTIRELY YOU CAN BE JUST FINE IF YOU'RE DOING MORE THAN THAT ESPECIALLY THREE TO FOUR TO FIVE TO SEVENTY YOU CAN HAVE TO HAVE SOME BREATHING STRATEGY A VERY COMMON ONE IS IM PROBABLY EVERY THIRD BREATH I'MANT T DO LIKE EX CELE THE THIRD RESET REBREATHE SOMETHING LIKE THAT IF YOUF YOU' LIKE YOU NEED TO BREATHE AFTER EVERY ONE AT DOCAY BUT IT'SGON TO GET WASTEFULKCOU YOU HVE TO TAKE TIME AND BETWEEN REPS OF SITTING THERE IF IT'S A SQUAT THAT'S DIFFERENT I PERSS A DEAD LIFT IF YOU'RE RESTING THE BOTTOM SO THAT THERE IS LITTLE BIT A GAME HERE SO IN GENERAL THOSE AS THAT SEVENTY FIVE SEVENTY FIVE CONTRALY THROWN OUT IF THREW OUT BREATHE IN DO THE LOWERING AN EXHALE ON THE OUT IF YOU HAVE TO LAST REPS DON'T WORRY ABOUT MORE REPS THAN YOU NEED COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF BREATHING STRATEGY ABOUT BREATHING IN BETWEEN SETS A AND MAYBE EVEN AFTER THE WORK OUT YE THIS IS ONLY I THING A LOT OF PEOPLE OVERLOOK LIKE  AND BECAUSE THE IT IS THE CASE THAT RECOVERY HAS TO DO BOTH WITH THE SPECIFIC ACTIVATION AND A TO MUSCLES AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM BUT ALSO THE TACKS ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM CAN ALSO TAKE PLACE BETWEEN SETS IMIF YOU'RE REALLY GEURED UP BETWEEN SATS AND YOU GO TO DREDDLE AND YOU KNOW AS HIGH AND BETWEEN SETS ORE CLOSE TO IT AS YOU ARE DDURING YOUR SETS YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THE RECOVERY WOULD TAKE LONGER OR AT LEAST THAT YOU'RE NOT SPENDING A DRENDLEIN IN MOST SUFFICIENT WAY IF THERE IS SUCH A THING YE FAR YOU'RE NOT NTA SEE ANY AFTLY THAT I WORK WITH JUST BREATHEIN BETWEEN WHETHER IT'S IN BETWEEN ANINGS OR IN BETWEEN ROUNDS EVERY SINGLE ONE THEM'S GOING TO GO BACK SIT IN THE STOOL AND THERE NOT IMMEDIATELY BE INTO A BREATHING RERTANE A VERY INTENTIONAL ONE THE'RE LITOP AT DIFFERENT FOR RATLY DEPENDING ON THE SPORT EVEN A P JA GOLFER THERE'S GING TO BE A WE JUST SET OUR BALL YORE MOVING THE NEXT ONE WERE GOG TO GOING TO BREATHING STRATEGY EVERY ONE OMIT'S IT'S A HUGE AREA A POTENTIAL BENEFIT AND  CONSEQUENCE IF YOU'RE JUST IGNORING IT I'M IN GENERAL WE WANT TO DO ANY SORT OF CALMING BREATH WE WANT TA RESTORE IT DEPENDS ON IF THE IT'S PENSIL WORE COMBATING OR COMBMANDING LOW OXYGEN OR HIGH SEAL TO SO THAT STRATEGY'S GOINGO BE LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BUT IN GENERAL THAT IS A HUGE TIME OPPORTUNITY TO GET BETTER IN FACT OM  PEOPLE CAN GO BACK AND LISTEN TO SOME OF YOUR EARLIERPITOLS O YOU TALKED ABOUT WIL YOU HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT I THINK ON THE SHOW WHEN A NORPOSTICITY WORKS AND IF YOU'RE LOSING THAT OPPORTUNITY POST EXERCISE YOU'RE LEAVING GAINS ON THE TABLE IF YOU WELL SO NOT ONLY ARE YOU TO SEE EVERYTHING OUT THAY SET I WORK WITH MOSTLY HAVE A BREASIN TRATITY IN COMPETITION WE'RE NOT GOING TO JUST FINISH A WORK OUT HIG FIVE DRINK WATER AND WALK OUT F O YOU THERE WILL BE A DOWN REGULATION STRATEGY THAT IS HEAVILY INVOLVED WITH SOME SORT OF LIGHT CONTROL AS WELL AS BREATH CONTROL I'M THE INDIVIDUAL PRESCRIPTION ON THAT THERE'S A TON AF VARIATION WITH WHAT YOU CAN DO THE EASIEST THING IS DO SOMETHING THAT CALMS YOU DOWN MOST LIKELY THAT'S GOING TO BE MOVED TOWARDS AS MUCH NEILS OR BREATHING AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY DO AND IA REALLY EASY RULE THOM IS A DOUBLE EXHAL LENGTH RELATIVE TO ANHOW SO IF YOU NEED TO TAKE A I FOR SECOND IN HALE DOUBLE THAT TIME AND BREATHE OUT FOR EIGHT SECONDS A BOX BREATHING IS FIND SO EQUAL IN HAL EQUAL HOLD EQUAL EX HALE EQUAL HOLD SO FOR SECOND IN HAL FOR SECOND ACTS HOLD AT CECOR ET CETERA A TRIANGLE IS FINE TOO THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS YOU CAN GET REALLY COMPLICATED LIKE WHAT BRYANE MC KENZIO WILL DO IN ROB THOSE GUIES HAVE YOUGET ALL KINDS OF SYSTEMS FOR IN HALE LEX SI CONTROL IN CAN BE OP TOMISE BUT SOME STRATEGY OF CALM I'M WE'RE GONE ALMOST ALWAYS PUT YOU ON YOUR BACK OR CLOSE ANDTHE WERE N TO COVER LEGTH I'M WE CAN DO SOME LIKE WE'VE DONE ACTUALLY A NUMBER OF A MUSICAL INTERVENTIONS AS WELL BUT YOU CAN AS JUST AS SIMPLE AS SIT DOWN A LOCKROOM IF YOU HAVE TO AND JUST BREATHE FOR FIVE MINUTES THAT ALONE IS CAN BE PRODUCTIVE THAT'S GREAT IFYOU'RE BREATHING IN THE LOCKER ROOM FOR FIVE MINUTES I SUJEST CLOSING YOUR EYES OR YU GET SOME FUNNY LOOKS AND IF A YOU'LL STILL GET FUNNY LOOKS BUT YOU WON'T SEE PEOPLE LOOKING AT YOU EXACTLY A I LOVE THIS AND I STARTED DOING THIS BECAUSE YOU AND BRIME MC KENZIE INFORMED ME ABOUT THIS AND IT COMPLETELY CHANGE THE RATE OF RECOVERY FOR ME I REALIZE THAT I WAS LEAVING WORK OUT BOTH ENDURANCE WORK OUT AND STRENGTH APERTROPHY WORK OUTS FEELING GREAT BUT LOOKING AT MY PHONE GETTING RIGHT INTO YOAIL AND MEATINGRI NOT CONCENTRATING ONL MY BREATHING AND ALL I DID WAS TO INTRODUCE A ON YOUR RECOMMENDATION A FIVE MINUTE DOWN REGULATION SO EXHAILE EMPHASIED BREATHING A A A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT BRADY'S PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE BOX BREATHING EXTAILE EMPHASIZED T TWICE AS LONG AS THE IN HAL COMA COMPONENT FOR FIVE MINUTES AND I NOTICED TWO THINGS ONE I RECOVERED MORE QUICKLY WORK OUT TO WORK OUT NO QUESTION ABOUT IT YET THE NUMBERS AM TOLD ME THAT AND THE OTHER IS AT I USED TO HAVE THIS AM DIP IN ENERGY THAT WOULD OCCUR THREE OR FOUR HOURS AFTER A HARD WORK OUT AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT HAD TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT I GENERALLY EATEN A MEAL AT SOME POINT POST WORK OUT TURNS OUT IT WASN'T THE MEAL AT ALL YE IT'S AT THAT THAT A DRENNLAND AM RAMP UP DURING THE WORK OUT I WAS IN CLAMPING THAT AT THE END AND SO I THINK EVENTUALLY IT'SLY THRASHED AND THEN THREE FOR HOURS LATER I'M A HAVING A HARDTIME EVEN READING WHAT'S ON THE SCREEN IN MY COMPUTER THINKING MABE IT'S THE SCREEN MAYBE WAS WHAT AIGHT LUNCH TURNS OUT THE DOWN REGULATIONS ALLOWED ME TO WORK THROUGH THE AFTERNOON WITH NO ISSUES WHATSOEVER YET IT'S REALLY BEEN QUITE POWERFUL AND SAW IT GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR THAT ND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK NINETY EIGHT PER CENT OF PEOPLE ARE NOT DOING AND IT'S ONLY FIVE MINUTES YOU U YOU HAE TO O FIVE GIVE ME THREE IF YOU REALLY HAVE TO PUSH IT GIVE ME THREE AND YOU CAN EVEN DO THIS YOU CAN SAFE TIME YOU CAN DO THIS IN THE SHOWER F WE HAVE TO SO YOU'RE YOU'RE DONE YOU'RE FINISH DRINK AWATER WHATEVER HAS TO BE AND YOU'RE GETTING A SHOWER YOU RERING YOU READY JUST GIVE ME THREE MINUTES THE SHOWER IT'S NOT IDEAL BUT AS LITTLE AS THAT IT CAN PAY HUGE DIVITENCE YOU NEED SOME SORT OF INTERNAL SIGNAL THAT WERE SAFE THROTDLE DOWN HERE MOR AN A MOVE ON THAT HAS TO HAPPEN II IT CO GONE ON HERE BUT I I THINK WE'RE MAKEN THE SAME POINT CIN ON OVER AGAIN IT'S THIS BIG DEAIN TO IT AND YOU'RE SAVING ENERGY IM IN THE ENERGY HERE IS NURL ENERGY I THINK FIGHTERS DO THIS GOOD FIGHTERS LEARN TO DO THIS BETWEEN ROUNDS YESPRINTERS LEARN TO DO THIS BETWEEN EVENTS I THINK HUMAN SHOULD LEARN HOW TO DO THIS BETWEEN ANY YOU KNOW I SORT OF INTERVAL TYPE ACTIVITY INCLUDING WORK SO SHGAGEMEN I MEN IS OSUCH A POWERFUL TOO DO THIS FOR ONE MINUTE AFTER EVERY IMPORTANT WHETHER IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL HIGH VOLITAL INTERACTION OR IF IT'S AS YOU JISTID A NICE FORTY FIVE MINUTES SPRENT TO WORK AND YOUR DEEP INTORIT WHEN EVER FIND JUST GIVE ME ONE MINUTE SET YOUR LARM JUST ONE MINUTE AND THAT ALSO WELL PAY DIVIDENCE I LOVE IT AND AS I SAID IT'S MADE O EA OUTSIZE A DIFFERENT POSITIVE DIFFERANCE ON MY TRAINING BUT ALSO ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE MY TRAINING WHICH IS FOR ME I'M NOT A PROFESSIONAL LATHLET I TRAIN FOR HEALTH AND BECAUSE I ENJOY IT BUT WHEN A REALLY HARD WORK OUT STARTS INTERFERE WITH THE ABILITY DO THE OTHER THINGS IN LIFE THAT'S NOT A GOOD SITUATION SO THIS IS RULY TERRIFIC THERE'S A LOT MORE IN EACH OF THE THOSE CATEGORIES OF STRENGTH AND AM HYPERTROPHY BUT YOU'VE GIVEN US A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF VALUABLE INFORMATION THERE MAYBE NOW WOULD BE GOOD TIME TO SHIFT TO ENDURANCE AND OF THE FOUR TYPES OF ENDURANCE IM IT MAYBE COULD REMIND US WHAT THOSE ARE WHAT DO YOU THINK OR THE TWO THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE SEEKING OR PURSUING IN TERMS OF HEALTH AND AESTHETICS RIGHT I' MA REALIZE THAT WE PROBABLY HAVE ATHLETES OUT THERE AS WELL BUT THINK AM WHEN I THINK HEALTH IN THE SATICS I THINK O CAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SUSTAINED ENDURANCE THIRTY PLUS MINUTES OF SOME ON GOING ACTIVITY HOW DOES ONE MAXIMIZE THAT WORK I WHATER THE MODIFIABLE VARIABLES AND THEN MAYBE COULD TELL US WHAT THE THE OTHER MAJOR CATEGORY IS YET THAT PEOPLE OUGHT TO HAVE IN THERE I'M KIT WHEM SO STARTING OFF WITH EXERCISE CHOICE ONE THING AS SOON AS WE CROSS INTO THE ENDURANCE WORLD AND THIS IS TRUE FOR ALL FOR THOSE CATEGORIES EXERCISE CHOICE SEEMS TO BE VERY CONCERNED WITH ECENTRIC LANDING SO YOU DON'T NEED TO AVOID IT BUT YOU NEED TO RECOGNIZE IT RELATIVE ARE COMPARED AGAINST THOSE OTHER STRENGTH AND SPEED ONCES THE VOLUME IS LOW ONMOSE ONES O YOU HAVE SOME E ENTRIC ABSORPTION ITS OA KAV BUT AS WE SORT OF TALKED ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AGO MORE ECENTRIC MEANS GREATER CHANCE TO MUSCLE DAMAGE SORTESS SO IF YOU TAKE SOMETHING AND MAGNIFY IT ACROSS THIRTY MINUTES OR EVEN FIVE MINUTES BUT AF MAXIMAL EXERTION YOU HAVE A RECIPE FOR BLOWING UP YOU CAN IMAGINE I HAVEN'T RUN AND FOREVER AND I'VE JUST OF LISTEN TO THIS SEERMAN LAPODCAS AND A'M OKAKE OMIN TO GET INTO MY ZOWN TOE TRAINING WHATEVER AND I START JOGGING I MUT DO I NO I REMEBE WHEN I WAS I USED TO BUILITY TO TWENTY FIVE AND YOU JUST DO A TWENTY FIVE MINUTE JOG THE AR NOUNT OF E CENTRIC LANDING THAT JUST OCCURRED ON EVERY SINGLE STEP BECAUS YU'RE NEVER WITH RUNNING EVEN SLOW RUNNING YOU'RE NEVER HAVE TWO FEET ON THE GROUND THE SAME TIME SO IT IS A ONE FOOT LAND ONE FOOT LAND YOURE ENTIRE BODY MASS PLUSS GRAVITY UNTO ONE LEG AT A TIME REPEATED NOW HUNDREDS OF TIMES THAT E CENTRIC LANDING IS GONE TO COST TREMENDOUS SORNIS YOU'RE QUADS AR GIN TA GO YOU'R A PROBABLY GENYGET SHINSPLINCE WHICH IS WITH THIS ISN THOSE ENTIRELY CAUSE BY ECENTRIC LANDING IM IN WHEN THE TISSUE IS NOT READY TO TOLERATE THAT IF YOU'RE NOT LANDING CORRECTLY THIS IS WHEN NE PAIN HAPPENS BACK PAIN SHOULDER NECKPAIN CAUSE WEM COMPENSATION  ANY TIME WE START PRESSING TO FATIGUE LET'S BE VERY CONCERNED WITH THERE SO MI INITIAL I RECOMMENDATION IS START WITH ACTIVITIES EXERCISE CHOICEWISE THAT ARE MOSTLY CONCENTRIC BASE SO THINK ABOUT A CYCLE SO WHEN YOU'RE RITING ON A BIKE YOU'RE PUSHING THE PETAL BUT YU'RE NEVER LANDING AND ABSORBING IT SO YOU COULD GO OUT INTO A FORTY FIVE MINUT BIKE RIE YOU'RE NOT GOINGTO GET THAT SORE BECAUSE IR'S NOT A LOT AF ECENTRIC LOAD I'M SWIMMING SIMILAR THING HERE WRIGHT THERE SOME ECENTRICS WHEN YOU'RE HAND IT'S THE WATER BUT FAIRLY MENALMOST MOSTLY A PUSH PUSH PUSH PUSH PUSH NO LOAD ROWING SIMILAR THING MOSTLY CONCENTRIC I'M PUSHING A SLED IS FANTASTIC GOING UP HILL RUNNING OR EVEN WALKING HARD UP HILL ALL GOOD CAUSE HERE VERY MINIMAL LANDING RELATIVE TO LIKE RUNNING DOWN HILL WHICH YOUL BE A VERY VERY BAD IDEA I'M TO START SO WHEN YIF YOU'RE HCH FIRST JUMPING INTO THESE THINGS PROGRESS YOUR VOLUME FOR ENDURANCES VERY SLOWLY IF IT INVOLVES ECENTRIC LANDING IT REALLY BAD STRATEGY WE BE TO JUMP IN AND DO SAY CIRCUIT TRAINING CLASS TAT INVOLVES A BUNCH OF BOXJUMPS RIGHT THIS IS NOT A GOOD WAY A TO DO YOUR FIRST BORE RAY INTO CONDITIONING YOU'RE GOING TO GET INCREDIBLY SORE BECAUSE YOU'RE JUMPING IN LANDING YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT THREE TO TEN EX BODYWEIGHT IN TERMS OF ABSORPTION WITH A SINGLE LAND EVEN IF YOU JUST JUMPING SO BE CAREFUL OF THAT I'M IN ANY OF THOSE ENDURANCE AREAS OF EXERCISE CHOICE SO WHAT TO PICK PICK THE ONE THA YOU ARE MOST TECHNICALLY PROFICIENT AN BECAUEYOUE CNTO DO IT A LOT ITS CAN BE LOT OF RE PETITIONS WHATEVER ONE YOU FEEL THE MOST JOYIN IF THAT'S ROWING GREAT THAT'S PUSHING A SLED IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER I'M YOU CAN DO THIS ACTUALLY WITH WAIGHTS AS ARE PREFERRED WAY BY THE WAY WITH OUR ATHLETES SO WE MIGHT DO A THIRTY MINUTES CIRCUIT WHERE WE DO A FIVE MINUTE FARMERS CARE RY WITH A PETTY LIKHE WAYS YOU JUST IN A CARRY SOME WAITS IN YOUR HAND AN USCN A WALK UP AND ON THE STREET FOR FIVE MINUTES AYOUOU JUS SET THAT DOWN AND THE YOURE GONG TO DO SAY A THREE MINUTE PLANK AND N YOU TO PICK THAT UP WHEN YU'REGOTG NDO BODY WEIGHT SQUATS LIK SLOWLY AND JUST TEMPLE AND YOU NON DO HANDFUL OF DIFFERENT EXERCISES SO THE OUT THES DON'T GET SUPERBOARD OR A VERY SIMPLE ONE AT THE THIRTYMENT WORK OUT TEN MINUTES ON A TRID MELL TEN MINUTES ON A BYE TEN MINUTES ON ORAR FOR THOSE YOITHER LIKE A MY GOT I CAN'T DO THIRTY STRAIGHT MENUES R RUNNING O BREAK IT UP IN TO THREE OR FOUR DIFERENT EXERCISES THAT AR ALL FAIRLY SAVE SO THAT'S HOW I WOULD DO THAT LONG DURATION PIECE OT IT FRECTISE CHOICE AND THEN IN TERMS OF HEART RAT DURING THAT THAT PERIOD I MEAN HOW MUCH TENTION SHULD WE PAY TO THIS I THE DON A VERY BROAD AM PRESCRIPTIVE I'VE THROWN OUT ON THIS PODCAS A FOW TIMES PASE ON MY REA OF THE LITERATURES FOR MOST PEOPLE THAT ARE ORIENTO TOWARD HEALTH INCLUDING PEOPLE THEIR WORKNG ON SIZE AND STRENGTH GAINS I PERTPEN STRENGTH OF COURSE A THAT GETTING A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO A HUNDRED EIGHTY MINUTES HAVE SO CALLED ZONE TO CARDIO YE A YOU KNOW CAN JUST HAVE A COP JUST BARELY HAVE A CONVERSATION BUT IF ONE WERE TO PUSH ANY HARDER YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO THAT KIND THING ITS JUST A AS A A VA GENERIC RECOMMENDATION THAT ALMOST EVERYBODY SHOULD FOLLOW IN ORDER JUS KEEP THEIR CARDY OF ASCULAR SYSTEM HEALTHY BUT I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF NEW AUNTS THERE AND SOME PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO RUN  CONTINUOUSLY FOR AN HOUR AT SPEED RIGHT I'M YE I'VEYOUS NOT SPRINTING BUT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE AM FINER FINER POINTS ON YET LONG DISTANCE EN DURANCE SO I HOW OFTEN SHOULD ONE DO IT OOKAY A FREQUENCY CON DO ITA DAILY I EVEN WHEN STRAINGTH DOING STRENGTH AND HYPER NO QUESTION WTH I THING IS AN IMPORTANT POINT FOR PEOPLE HERE ICAUSE A LOT OFYOU'LL TINK THATHEY ARE GOING TO GREATLY DI MINISH THEIR STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY ND YOURE GAIMS AS IT'S OFTEN CALLED AM BY DOING IN IS OWN TO CARDIO ZON TOO YOU HAVE ALMOST NO ABILITY TO BLOCK YOUR HPERTROPY ZON'T TOO TRULY ITS LEALLY WITHIN THAT CATEGORY IF YOUR TALKING ABOUT CONVERSATIONAL PACE THERE IS VERY E FACT THERE IS STRONG REASON TO THINK THAT IS NOT AN INFLUENCE IPERTROPHY FOR THE OVERWHELMIN TE DRORTING PEOPLE AN MIGHT EVEN HELP IT BY INCREASING BLOOD FLOW TO THE VERY ABSOLUTELY A DOES IT MATTER LET SAY SOME ONE'S DOING PRIMARILY STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY THERE THEY'RE PRIMARY GOALS AR STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY AND THEN THEY'RE  GOING TO DO HEY'RE GINGTO HIT THAT HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO A HUNDRED EIGHTY MINUTESS OWN TO CARDIO PER WEEK ASSUMING THEIR BREAKING THAT UP INTO THREE OR FOUR SESSIONS DOES IT MATTER IF THEY DO IT IN THE SAME WORK OUT BEFORE WERE AFTER DOES THAT MATTER A I TEND TO DO JUST BY WAY OF EXAMPLE FOR PEOPLE CERTAINLY I'M JUST ONE A ONE EXAMPLE I TEND TO DO A RESISTANCE TRAINING ONE DAY THEN I'LL DO ZON TO CARDIO NEXT I JOG CAUSE THAT'S THE THING I PREFER THEN I'LL BUT DO STRAINT HUPPER TO RE TRAIN THE NEXT DAY AND THEN IN JOG FOR MIS OWN TOO CARDIO AND THEN I TAKE ONE FUL DAY OFF A WEEK I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY DONE THE ZON TO CARDI ON THE SAME DAY BUT WERE I TO DO IT ON THE SAME DAY WOULD IT MATTER IF I DID IT BEFORE AFTER MY MY STRENGTH OF PERCHA RETURINING NOT REALLY YOU'RE GIN TO BE JUST FIND INTERFERENCE OF FACTS THE INTERFERENCE OF FACT IS WHAT THE SCALLED SO THIS IS ALL THE WAY BACK O NINETEEN EIGHTY A BOB PICKMAN STOFF RIGHT AND AN HE WAS ACTUALLY WORKING IN A LAB WITH JOHN ALAZI WHOSE ONE OF THE THE FATHERS OF EXERCISED BOU CHEMISTRY AND THE SORE THE STORY GOES IT I HICKMAN CAME IN HE WAS THE STRENGTH TRAINING GUY AND AND LASIN ALMOST ALL THOSE INITIAL EXISE PHYSIOLOGIST WERE CONDITIONING FOLKS RIGHT SO IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS SWIMMERS AND RUNNERS A THAT'S WHY A BULK OF THE EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY HISTORICALLY IS IS SHAPED IN THAT DIRECTION IN SO TOSE SCIENCIS WERE INTERESTED HIM SO HICKMAN WAS THERE IN THE LABIN IN THE HOW MUCH OF THIS IS MYTH OR NOT WHORETHEYKNOWS BUT SO THE STORY GOES I THAT THIS SORT OF CHIPPING BACK AND FORTH AND YEUKNOHOW FROM A PIAGO POSTOCK KAN HAW THAT RASING WORKS LTTLE BIT AND EVENTUALLY  LYCA GOT USTO RUNNING WITH US AND HE WAS LIKE YOU GOSSOR LIFTING WITH ME AND CON IT GOES BACK AND FORTH WELL YOU KNOW WHENS N THAT ECQUASION IT'S NOT THE POSTOCK RIGHT SO IT'S THE PE I GETS ITIN IS HICMANS IS OCAY FINDS WE STRETCH RUNNING WITH LAZI AN N EVENTUALLY SUCH REALIZE I'M GETTING WEAK I'M LOSING STRANGTH TAN I GOT JUS CANP I THNK IS HIS BENCH PR  SPECIFICALLY WAS GOING DOWN OR MAYBE A SQUAT AND CAN MURBER WHO KNOWS IT'S EVEN REAL BUT POINT IS SO 'S GOING ALONG AND SO THEMINTIALY LIKE SORTS TO CRAT ALITLE BIT OF ANIMOSITY AND I'S LIKE ACTUALY ON IS GOOD FOR ME AND THEN BABABA AND SO THEY DID WHAT ANY GOOD SCIENCIS OR DO AND SAID WELL LET'S FIND NOUT RIGHT AND SO THAT HE RUN A REALLY FAMOUS EXPERIMENT WHERE HE TOOK A GROUP THREE GROUPS ONE GROUP DID A A ENDURANCE PIECE R AT THE STEADY STATE CARTYA ONE GROUP DID A STRENGTH TRAINING PIECE AND THEN THE THIRD GROUP DID BOTH F THOSE WORK OUTS COMBINED NOT LIKE A REDUCTION SO BOTH BOTH VOLUMES STACKED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AND THE RESULTS ARE EFAIRLY PREDICTABLE IN TURMS OF THE ENDURANCE GROUP ONLY HAD THE GREATEST INCREASES IN VIEL TO MAXS AN ENDURANCE MARKER IS THE STRENGTH TRAINING GROUP BY THE GREATEST INCREASES AND MOST SLIE PERTURVE BUT WHERE THE INTERESTING PART WAS AN WHERE THIS WHOLE FIELD STARTED WAS THE COMBINED GROUP SINCE HIS CONCURRENT TRAINING IS WHAT A SGENERALLY CALLED SO YOU'R OING CONCURRENT THINGS AND TYPICAY THAT MEANS HYPERTRY IN STRENGTH STACKED ON TOP OF SOME INSTAY STATEIN DURANCE IN THE SAME WORK SAME SAME SAME WORT AO OUR BLOCK OR SAME LIKE WEAK IT DOESN'T REALLY IK AN BE GOT CIND OF ALL THESE WELL THE CONCURRANT GROUP SAW THE SAME IMPROVEMENTS IN BEAL TWO MACTS AS THE ENDURANCE GROUP AND HE'S LIK WOKA SO THE STRENGTH TRAINING DID NOT COMPROMISE THE ENDURANCE ATPTATIONS HOWEVER THEY SAW MUCH LOWER INCREASES IS STRENGTHAN I PERTORY AND SO IT WAS THE CONCLUSION WAS THE EDITION OF ENDURANCE WORK COMPROMISED MOST OF GROWTH AND STRENGTH DEVELOPMENT HOWEVER THE EDITION OF STRENGTH TRAINING TO YOUR ENDURANCE WORK WELL NOT COMPROMISE YOUR ENDURANCE GAINS NOW THAT SECOND PIECE HAS BEEN SHOWN COUNTLESS MORE TIMES RIGHT SO IF YOU AN ENDURANCE ATLY ADDING STRENGTH TRAINING IS ALMOST ALWAYS GOING TO BE MASSIVELY BENEFICIAL VERY LITTLE CHANCE OF JECTUREMEN FON IT IS WHY EVERY DURANCE OUT LADIES CAN HAVE SOME SORT OF STRENGTH AND POWER COMPONENT TO THEIR TRAINING THE CONTROVERSY THOUGH CAME IN THE INTERFERENCE EFFECTS O HOW MUCH IN DURANCE TRAINING REALLY BLOCKS MUSCULAR DEVELOPMENT AND FOR YE UREIS MYSELF INCLUDED WAS WE PREACHED HARD YOU DON'T DON'T DO THESE TWO THINGS AT THE SAME TIME A MY FRIEND MY COLLEACE EVEN MERIC HAS AS A REALLY NICE REVEUARICAL JIMMY BAGLEY THOSE TWO GITES PUT THIS CING OUND YOU GO READ THAT A WERE THEY COVER ALL THESE THINGS THEY'VE GOT SOME NICE FIGURES IN THER BUT THE GENERAL ANSWER HERE IS INTERFERENCE EFFECT IS SORT OF REAL BUT IT'S PROBABLY GREATLY OVERBLOWN IT MATTERS SO YOU TALKING ABOUT A TWENTY MINUTE JOG AT CONVERSATION PASE THAT'S PROBABLY DOING VERY LITTLE A WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT ARE YOU DOING IN EASCENTRIC BASS EXERCISE LIKE RUNNING WIL THEN YOU CEN HAVE MORE OF INTERFERENCE EFFECT THAN CYCLING THAT MAKES A TONOCENSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT A RIGHT WHAT'S YOUR TOTAL ENERGY IN TIC IF YOUR EATING SUFFICIENT CALORIES YOU CAN STILL BE AN ANABALIC STATE IF THE EDITION OF EXTRA ENERGY EXPENDITURE SALL IT REALY IS MARK THE CARDIO PUT YOU IN A NEGATIVE ENERGY STATE IT'S BEING IT'S GOEN BECOME VERY DIFFICULT TO GO THROUGH ANNIBALISM SO THOSE THINGS MATTER A IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING LIKE RUNNING A FEW LAPSE AROUN THE TRACT AS A WARM UP THAT'S NOT INTERFERENCE EFFECT WHAT WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT AS A BIG VOLUME PERFORMED CONSISTENTLY NOW AFTER HICKMAN CAME OUT THIS PAPER PAPER NINETEEN EIGHTY PEOPLE FOLLOWED IT UP IN THE NINETIES IN TO THOUSANDS WITH MECHANISM AND WE STARTED O LOOK AND SEE WE SARE TO SE HA THEREIS THIS SO SELL SIDNLIN PATHWAY THAT GOES DOWN CALLE M TOR AN D THAT'S WHAT LEADS TO MUSCLE GROWTH AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THT EQUASION AS A THING CALL AM P QU WHICH IS MORE ASSO CIATED WITH MITOCONDREOBILE GENESIS AN ENDURANCE AND THERE'S AS LITTLE MOLECULON BETWEEN AT THE TIME MOST PEOPLE WOULD POINT TO T  C TOO WELL TURNS OUT AM PQU ACTIVATION IS FINE IF YOU ACTIVE AT M TOUR AS NO BEARING ON M P Q BUT IF YOU ACTIVE A THE M PQUTES CAN ACTOF A T CY TOO WHICH IN HIEDAM TOR AND SO IT WAS LIKE WE HAD PRACTICAL OUTCOME I EED HICKMAN YOU'RE GINGTO GET WEAKER NOW WE HAD MECHANISM S THAT STORY BECAME VERY VERY STRONG AT THIS INTERFERENCE EFFECT THIS IS HOW SCIENCE SHOULD WORK RIGHT WHEN YOU SEE MECHANISM MATCH UP WITH PRACTICAL HUMAN OUTCOME SO STRONG AS WE ON IET WAS STILL WRONG THEM IT W JUST TOOK MORE SCIENCE RIGHT THIS IS WHY WE ALWAYS HAVE TO GIVE SCIENCE A BIT OF TIME AND A U HAVE TO BE WILLING TO TO FOLLOW RIGHT AND AGAIN EVEN ME IN THE FIELD WHO HAS A PRACTICION OF BACKGROUND AND SCIENCE I FELT VERY STRONGLY THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM IT JUST DINTEROUN TO BE THE CASE A NOUGH STUDIES CAME OUT WHEREO MY OQ IT'S PROBING NOT THAT BIGADEAL UNLESS THE EASTT THE MOVEMENT IS HEAVILY ECENTRIC BASE THE VOLUME IS VERY HIGH YOURE TRYING TO MACIM IE MOSTL GROWTH AND ENERGIES NOT CONTROLLED IF THAT'S NOT ALL THE CASE INTERFERENCE EFFECT IS PROBABLY NOT SOMETHING MOST PEOPLE SHOULD WORRY ABOUT A WHEN YOU SPECIALLY WHN YOU COMPARE THAT AGAINST THE WELL ROUNDEDNESS THAT YOU NEED FOR TOTAL PHYSIOLOGICAL HEALTH PROBING OT BIG O VERY REASSURING ME DEAR BECAUSE I DO ENJOY LIFTING WAIGTS THAT I REA LY ENJOY RUNNING AND I LOVE RUNNING OUTSIDE I BELIEVE I USED TO EXPERIENCE THE INTERFERENCE EFFECT WHEN I USED TO DO A VERY LONG RUN ON SUNDAYS I WOULD JUST GO FOR OUT FOR YOU TWO HOURS OR SO YOT LIKE THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT I ATE ENOUGH FOR WHO KNOWS I WAS FEEL LIKE I  ENOUGH FOR A MORE A MY LOVE TO EAT BUT THAT LONG SUNDAY RUN ALWAYS MADE IT HARD FOR ME TO MAKE FRAGGRESSIVE YEUM I GAINS IN STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY IN THE GIM WHERE AS WHEN I CUT THAT TO THIRTY MINUTES THREE OR FOUR TIMES A WEEK I DON'T SEE ANY INTERFERANCE OF AT AT ALL PROBY BEREAL AND I HAVEN'T TRAINED SPECIFICALLY FOR ENDURANCE IN A VERY LONG TIME SO I DON'T UM I HAVEN'T EXPERIENCE THE NON INTERFERANCE EFFACT WHICH AS YOU SAID BEFORE MOST IF NOT ALL ENDURANCE ATHLETS PROBABLY AR AT LEAS SHOULD BE DOING SOME SORT OF STRANGTH WORE JUST TO KEEP THE UNDER CARRIAGE STRONGNESS I THINK YET THERE'S BUNCARIESI  APOTYE SO T UM SO WHAT ARE SOME PROTO CALLS THAT PEOPLE COULD EXPLORE FOR CONTINUOUS INDURANCE TRAINING AND AD I'VE THROWN OUT THIS HUNDR OR FIFTY TO HUNDER AND EIGHTY MITZON TO CARDIO BUT THAT'S REALLY THE U THAT'S REALLY THE KIND OF KINDER GARDEN OF ENDURANCE YUM AND THERE I'M PRI BEIN GENEROUS IS BY THE NURSERY SCHOOL OF ENDURANCE THAT EVERY ONE SHOULD DO WHAT SORTS OF OTHER PROTO CALLS I REALIZE THIT CAN BE VERY GOLD DIRECTED BUT IS IT UNREASONABLE FOR INSTANCE FOR SOMEBODY TO DO UM FOUR HOURS OF Z OF CONTINUOUS INDURANCE TRAINING WITH INTERVALS IN THERE IS WELL TO GET IT KIND OF ALL AROUND HART HEALTH AND THE ABILITY TO GO LONG DISTANCES YE I'LL ANSWER THIS TO IS THE VERY FIRST ONE THE TACKLE THE THE LONG DURATION ANDURANCES HOWEVER PERT F IT IM YOU ASKED REALLY ABOUT HEART RAYS ON A TO ME THAT'S ALMOST WHOTALY A RELL OF IT IT' AT DOESN'T MATTER RIGHT IF YOU'RE MOVING YOUR MOVING THAT'S THAT'S THE FUNCTIONAL PIECE HERE IM I YOU WANT A PUSH IT AND GO AT A NON CONVERSATIONAL PACE THAT HAS TREMENDOUS HEALTH BENEFITS IF YOU ANT O DO IT A LITLEBISLOWER FINE IF YOU'RE OUT THE PACE WHERE YOU CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION TO ME I DON'T EVEN COUNT THAT IS EXERCISE THAT'S NOT TO IS NOT A PADORATIVE BY THE WAY IM THAT IS JUST GENERAL PHYSICAL MOVEMENT IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY CLEAR YOU NEED A LOT OF THAT YOU NEED A LOT MORE THAT THAN WE GET YOU CAN DO THIS IN A COUPLE OF EFFICIENT WAYS JUST TAKING YOUR FONE CALLS MOVING IF YOU GOT A THIRTY MINUTE CALL EVERY DAY OR MOST DAYS THE WEEK AND YOU CAN DO THAT WILE MOVING YOU'VE CHECKED NOT THAT WHOLE BOX BUT A PRETTY GOOD TRUNK OF IT AND THAT COULD EVEN BE DONE INSIDE HONDRY T RESISING BACK AND FORTH I'M A BIG PACER THE A YET YOU MEET TO LIKE YOU PRO ME SAW ME I COME  WALK UP AND DOWN ALL OVER THE PLACE IM MOST THE TIME WHEN I M I MY OFFICE WORKING I COM I'M SHATTLE BOX SAYING I COME TO AN AIRS CLOSS NOT EVEN INTENTIONALY I'M DISLIKE YOU HAVE ONE OF THOSE TREAD MILLS UNDER THE DUS I DON'T BUT LIKE EVERY LAB I EVER CAME THROUGH SOMEBODY DID WE 'DID AN EPISODE ON AT WORK SPACE OPTIMIZATION AND THE DATE ON THOSE TREAD MILLS YO APRTY INTERESTING THEY DEVILLY INCREASE ALERTNESS UM FOR WHICH FOR OBVIOUS REASONS THAT EVEN A LOW BIT OF MOVEMENT IS GOIN A GENERATE NO NOT BIT OF A DRENNLE AND UM SO PACING AROUND MOVING TAKING CALLS MOVING GET A OX WHEN YOU CAN AND THEN IN TERMS OF BUILDING IN DURANCE I SAY SOMEBODY WANTS TO QUOTIN GET INTO BETTER SHAPE YET UM THEY ALREADY MAYOR MAY NOT ALREADY HAVE SOME SIZE AND STRENGTH THAT THEY'RE HAPPY WITH AND THEY JUST WANT I GET IN THEY WANT IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH YET I WECANEL IS THAT  HUNDERE FIFTY HUNDRED AN EIGHTY BUT THIS THING TICK OVER INTO A DIFFERENT PROTO CALL YE O KASE SO I THINK THE WAY THAT I CAN OUTLINE A WEEKLY SCHEDUL JUST AS A CONCEPTIONAL MODEL HERE IM THAT LONGGERATION STUFF IS NOT EVEN COUNTING AS I MENTION I IS TO SAY THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO AS A HUMAN FOR WE HAVEN'T IMPROVED IF YOU'RE EXTREMELY UNFIT YOU MAY SEE SOME CHANGES IN CRNT OF ASK COR ELP THER FOR THE MOST PART THIS IS JOST KNOCKING OUT THE GENERAL PHYSICAL PRACTICE YOU NEED TO BE IRON FUNCTIONING SO WHATEVER THAT TIME TO MEAN IS IT ONLY CARE IM IS IS NOT A HUGE CONCERN OF MINE WHAT I THINK YOU NEED HIT OR THESE NOTES YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING ONCE A WEEK THAT GETS YOU TO A MAXIM HURRIED NOW I DON'T HAVE TO LITERALLY MEAN MAX BUT CLOTES THIS MEANS REALLY SUCKING FOR EVER REALLY LIKE AS HIGH AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY GET YOU CAN WEAR A HEART RY MONER IF YOU WANT BUT MAXIMUM HART RATE THE THE ROUGH OQUASION WE SAY IS TWO HUNDR AND TWENTY MINESTER AGE SO IF YOU'RE FORTY YEARS OLD YOU'RE MAXIM HART RATE IS PROBABLY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY BEATS PER MINUTE NOW I CAN TELL YOU FLAT OUT RIGHT NOW IM MY MAX HART RATE IS CLOSE TO TO TEN WHICH MEANS I'M CAN YEARS OLD SO TAKE THA NUMBER WITH A GRAN ASAUL I HAVE HAD A BUNCH OF PROFESSIONAL OUTTLEATS WHO AREIN THE'RE TWENTIES AND THER MAX HARRITES ONE SEVENTY FIVE AND THEY ARE WAY BETTER SHAPE THAN I AM SO MAXIMUM HART RAITE IS NOT A GOOD PROXY FOR PHYSICAL FITTENS IT'S A ROUGH NUMBER AN EASY WAY TO DO IT AS IF YOU HAVE A HARTRAE MONDER ANYTHING LIKE THAT DO THE HARDEST WORK OUT YOU CAN POSSIBLY DO SEE WHAT THE IGHEST NUMBER YOU GET AS AS SOON THAT'S CLOSE THAT'S IF YOU WANTED TO START IT TWO TWENTY MASTER AGE THAT'S FINE TO I DO SOMETHING THOU WHERE YOU LIKE YUP THIS IS DEATH I THIS IS REALLY REALLY CHALLENGE OR HOWLON HOWEVER LONG THAT TAKE YOU THAT CAN BE THIRTY SECOND GO ON AN ARODINE OR AIR SAULT BIKE THAT COULD BE A IM I DO ON OF THE THINGS WHERE YOU KIND I LIKE SPRENT RUN AS HARD AS YOU CAN DER IN THE STRAIGHT AWAY ON A TRACK AND LOCK THE CORNERS CON OF AN OLD CLASSIC BACK WHENT A NOU AN I ERE KIDS INTERVAL TRAINING THEY 'LL DO THAT AY MORE I GUESS I DON'T KNOW HOW I WER TO TALK ABOUT IT IN P CLASS WE HAD TO CHANGE AND IF YOU DIDN'T BRING RUNNING SHOES YED TO DO IT BAREFOOT OH I LOVE IN A I LOVE YOUR TEACHER YE IT WASN'T A WE OR FOOTBALL BASSWALL BASEBALL TEEMS WEREN'T THAT GOOD BUT IM ANLY LIKE RUNNING CROSS COUNTRY JUST UST WHERE I DREW UP O A RUTAL BRUTAL COACHES SO THAT YET THEY'D MAKE THE THE ALL KIDS DO THESE RUNS YET SO IT CAN BE IN THE THE THIRTY PROBABLY SECONDS AT A MINIMUM IT IT'S HARD TO GET YOU TO A TRUE HEART RATE MAX IN SHORTER THAN THIRTY SECONDS YOU DN'T GET TO TOTAL SOCK AN UNDER TWENTY SECONDS BUT GETTING TO A TRUE HRT ATE MAXIS IS PROBABLY TO TAKE MORE THAN THIRTY SECONDS SO IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT YOU WANT O DO IT CAN BE AGAIN A SPRENT UP HILL IT CULD BE W YOU'RE TALKING THAT CON BE PURPIESE TO DEATH AN LIKE WHATEER WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO TILL THOS HAVENANMY CENTRIC COMPONENT IG AT ET YORO YE NO QUESTION ABOUT IT IM BUT IF YOU DO TO ACTUAL DEATH BY THE WAY IF YOU JUST DID I'MN TO DO AS MANY BERPIECEAS I CAN FOR NINETY SECONDS IT PROBABLY WON'T TAKE YOU MUCH LONGER IN THAT TO GET TO CLOSE TO AND IT'S THAT  DO WORK OUT COULD BE SO ONCE A WEEK GET TO BAX ART RIGHT TOUCH IT I LOV IT TOUCH IT I'S NOT THE BEST BUT IT'LL IT'LL WORK I AND WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC BENEFITS OF THAT PROVIDES OO GAN SO EARLIER IN OUR AN OUR CHAT WER WE OUTLINED THE RUL SPECIFICITY SPECIFIC AT A POINADOPTITION TO IMPOSE TOMAN IF YOU'RE NEVER GETTING TO THAT HIGH OF A PACE YOU'RE NEVER IT WOULD BE LIKE TRYING TO GET STRONGER BUT ONLY GOING TO SIXTY PER CENT SO EVERY CARTY OF ASK OR ADAPTATION THAT O CURS WITH GRN OMASKER TRAINING IS TO SIMPLY GOING TO GET TO THE TOPER END BY DOING THIS SO IF YOU JUST START AT THE HART ITSELF STROKE VOLUME INCREASE THISIS AMOUNT OF BLOOD THAT'S ED OUT PUR CONTRACTION A CARTIAC OUT PUT RESTING HEART RATE IF YOU GO O THE ENDITHELIAL FUNCTION YOU'RE TALKING ABY NITRICKOXIDE RELEASE AND YOU'LL THELIAL HEALTH IN GENERAL I CAPLARY MOT O CONJURY ALLWAY DOWN LIKE YOU JUST WALK THROUGH THE WHOLE SYSTEM PULLMAN AIR EXCHANGE TO THE LONGS ALL OF THOSE ARE GOING TO BENEFIT BY BEING CHALLENGE TO THEIR MAXIUM I'LL SO TEACH YOU WERE YOUR VOMIT REFLECTS YE RIGHT BUT DON'T KNOW COM STRESS IS WHAT CAUSES ADAPTATION RIGHT SO IF YOU PUSH YOUR K HERE'S A DIFFERENCE IF YOU DID TWENTY FIVE MINUTES OF STEADY STATE YOU'RE NOT CHALLENGING THE SAME THING AS WHAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT I'M THE WAY THAT I EXPLAIN THIS IS IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE POINT THE POINT OF PHYSIOLOGICAL FAILURE THEN YOU UNDERSTAND THE PLACE OF ADAPTATION THAT'S IT SO IF YOU AND I BOTH GO RUN ON A WE DO TO BOTH DID A VEAL TO MAXTESS SO CLASSIC VEAL TWO MAX TESTS IS GOING TO TAKE EIGHT TWELVE MINUTES AND IT'SGON LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS OR E EG N GT IN A TREADMELL AND WE'RE GIT A RUN AND EVERY MINUTE I'M AN A TO SLIGHTLY INCREASE THAT TREADMELL EITHER THE SPEED OF THE GRATE MOST THE TIME ITS O SPEED RIGHT SO WE WE GET TO A HIGH GRADES SAY TEN PER CENT GRAT OR SOMETHING AND THEN WE GO FIVE MILES FORHOUR FIVE POINT TOO FIVE POINT FOUR MY AND WE JUST GO UNTILL YOU CAN'T GO ANY LONGER NOW LIT SAY YOU AN I DID THAT AND WE HAVE THE SAME EXACT TIME FRAME AND SO WE WE BOTH WENT EIGHT MINUTES I'M THE TIME YOU LAST IS NOT THE THIG THAT WE CARE ABOUT RIGHT IT'S THAT THIS THE VOLUME OF OXTION THAT YOU BREATHE OUT IS WHAT DETERMINES IT FELLET SAY N T THE SAME TIME TO MAIN AND WE HAE THE SAME VIAL TO MAX TO SAY HEY WARE BOTH FIFTY MILL LEADERS FOR KILEGRAMPER MINUTE WHICH IS LIKE A WOLL CAT NUMBER BUT THAT'S NOTHING TO BE EXTREMELY PROUD ABOUT JUST BECAUSE WE HAV THE SAME NUMBER DOES NOT MEAN WE HAVE THE SAME PLAT POINT OF PHYSIOLOGICAL FAILURE AND THIS MATTERS BECAUSE IT' CAN ANSWER THE WHAT DO I DO ABOUT IT THEN QUESTION RIGHT SO IF YOU GOT OFF AND I AND I S ER T ASKING A SERIES OF QUESTIONS AND OUR LIKE ANDI BISCUTS AN WHIDE YOU QUIT AND WHY WHY DIDS YOU JUMP OFF THE TREAD M WHY JYOU STOP AND YOU WERE LIKE MY CHEST  I COULDN'T CATCH MY BREATH I THOUGHT MY HEART WAS GOING EXPLODE OOK KINT GREGT IF YOU ASK ME AND I SAID MY LEGS ER ON FIRE LIKE WAS BREATHING HARD BUT I COULDN'T TAKE ANOTHER STEP THIS IS A VERY ROUGH INDICATOR OF DIFFERENT PLACES OF PHYSIOLOGICAL TIS RUPTION NOW WHAT I'VE SEEN A LOT WITH MY PROFESSIONAL ATLEATS SPECIALY LIKE FIGHTERS THERE TEN THEY'RE GOING TO GENERALLY FAIL THEIR LEGS BECAUSETHEY DON'T OFTEN DO A OT OF STRENGTH TRAINING IN THEIR LEGS THEY DON'T DO A LOT OF LEG WORK THEI'R FIGHTING ON THEIR BACK LITERALLY A LOT OR ON TOP AROUND THEIR NEES SO THERE THERE LEGS TEN TO GIVE OUT BEFORE THERE SOME ONE WHO FAILS IN THE CART OF ASCERS SYSTEM TET SAY YOU DID A LOT OF LEG TRAINING I'M TYPICALLY LIKE CAN ADURANCE OUTHING WHOS THAT'S NOT CAN BE TEIR SSUE IT'S THIS CONG TO BE THE CNT REACH A HEART WRAIHED BENTILATION THRESHALD THAT'S THEY CAN NO LONGER HANDLE IF I PUT YOU ON TH EXACTSING TRAIN PROTOCALLS IT'S NOT CAN BE IS EFFECTIVE BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO ALWAYS FAIL AT YOUR LEGS AND HEVER GON ALWAYS FAIL AT THERE CORTOF ASKER SYSTEM I NED TO FLIP THAT RIGHTIYOU NED TO PUT YOU IN A POSITION TO WHERE YOU CAN REACH A TRUE HEART RAID OR VENILATION CHALLENGE WHY YOUR LEGS ARE STILL HANGING IN THERE I'M OR THE OPPOSITE SO THE TRAINING PROTICAL IS BASED ON THAT POINT OF FAILURE IM THE ADAPTATION IS IN THE SAME THING SO IF YOU ARE  FAILING BECAUSE OF YOUR LEGS THEN YOU MIGHT SEE A GREATER INCREASE IN COMPLINIZATION IN YOUR LEGS WRELATIVE TO SOMEBODY ELSE WHOSE FAILING IN THEIR I CARTIVASCOSISTEM THEY MAY SEE A GREATER CHANGE IN AND SOMETHING ON THAT SIDE F THE EQUATION SO THAT IT ITMATTERS HOW YOURE FAILING AT ALL TIMES WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS IS THAT IT'S IT'S SOUNDS LIKE IT'S LIKE A THERMOMETER FOR WHERE ONE IS WEEK IN NEEDS WORK BUT ALSO PROVIDES A STIMULUS TO IMPROVE THE VERY THING THAT YOU NEED THAT'S THAT'S THE TEWORDAN SO TO JUST GET REAL BRASS TAX ABOUT IT IT WOULD BE ONCE A WEEK OUT NINETY NINETY SECONDS NEAR MAXIMUM HEART RAD I'LL MAKE WHAT I DO MORE COULD I DO FIVE OR SIX OF THOSE NINETY SECOND BOUTS NO QUESTION YOU CAN DO I'M IS LONG AS YOU TOUCH THAT MAXHART RIGHT I'M GOOD RIGHT I DEAL WORLD PROBABLY FOUR TO EIGHT IN THAT SINGLE SESSION IDEAL QUIT RIGHT IF THAT TAKES YOU TWENTY SECONDS OR NINTY SECONDS IT'S FINE I'M IF YOU OUGT TO DO THIRTY ON THIRTY OFF YOU OGHTO TDO TWENTY ON FORTY OFF FORTY ON TWENTY OUT THOSE NUMBERS DON'T MATTER AND IS THERE AN INTERFERENCE EFFECT OF THIS ON THE OTHER SORTS OF TRAIN THAT WE'VE TOKT A INTENDS TO BE COMPLIMENTARY THERE THEREIS THE THE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE SUGGEST THAT THIS HIGH INTERABLE STUFF IS IS MORE LIKELY TO BE COMPLIMENTARY TY PERTRY TRAINING I'M PROBABLY BECAUSE I LACTATE AND SOME OTHER COOL THINGS I'M WHICH ARE VERY BENEFICIAL MOLECULES OF PEOPLE ON UNDERSTAND THEY THEY THINK IT'S BAD IT'S ACTUALLY A HUGELY BENEFICIAL THING 'M IT CAN BE INTERFERENCE CAN PROVIDING YOUR FRIENDS IF CALORIES ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR OUR FRESTS ON ACCOUNT OF FOR  AND OTHER THINGS BUT IN GENERAL IT'S IT'S PROBABLY OK I'M I WOULDN'T AT IT TO YOUR OQUATION IF YOU DON'T NEED IT FOR MAXIMIZING I PERTRIVY BUT FOR THE PERSON WHO WANTS YOU TISTGET WELL ROUND I PHYSIOLOGY THE I WOULDN'T HESITATE 'M TO DO THESE EVEN THE SAME SESSION OR DIFFERENT SESSIONS TRIFIC SO AND IF THAT'S DONE ONCE A WEEK AND THE HUNDRER FIFTY TO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MINUTES OR SO OF HIS OWN TWO CARDIO'S DONE YOU KNOW IN THE REST OF THE WEEK IU Y EVER SINCE DOING THEIR STRAINT TAN I PERTURY TRAINING WE WOULD HOPE WHAT OTHER SORTS OF ENDURANCE PRACTICES COULD ONE IN CORPORAT YOU MENTION MUSCULAR ENDURANCS LIKE THE T E IT WOULD  LIKE A WALSIT OR THE ABILITY DO A PLANK YO WAS THAT IS TAT OMBTLHING IS THAT USEFUL FOR ANYTHING YES THIT BE DOING PLANKS AND WALLSIT NONO IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY USEFUL I'M LETT ST HOLD ON MUSCULAR DURANCE I WHN A FINISH ONE MORE THING ON THIS SIDE SO IF WE'RE BUILDING THIS  WEEK OF ENDURANCE I'M ONCE A WEEK HIT THAT NUMBER IF YOU CAN DO REPEATED BOUTS AND WE TALK FOUR TO EIGHT THAT'S FANTASTIC IF YOU CAN'T MUSTLE THE THE IF YOU CAN'T MANAGE THE MENTAL ENERGY EVERY WEEK DO IT EVERY OTHER WEEK IT'S STILL VERY GOOD RIGHT CAUSE II GET IT LIKE I'M A WORKING PERSON TOO IS SOMETIMESYOU DISLIKE I CANNOT  THOSE WORK OUTS FEEL INCREDIBLE AFTERWARDS BUT MAN THEY ARE DAUNTING IF YOU LOVE THI STUFF YOU COULD DO IT FOUR TIMES A WEEK IF YOU HATE IT THOUGH IT'S NOT REALISTIC TO THINK YOU CAN BEABLE TO KNOCK THIS OUT YOU GAN AIN AP DOING SEVENTY EIHTY PER CENT WHICH IS NOT CAN GET YOUTHE BENEFIT SOJUST DON'T DO ITYOU REALLY HAVE TO GIT THAT'S YOU GOT GET UP THERE CLOSE IL HAVE SOME ONE CHASE I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THE I'M I TO WHELDN' DOING THIS THIS KIND OF WORK IN IN MY MIND I'M THINKING THAT I'M BASILY BEING CHASE BY SOMEBODY WITH IT WITH A SRINGEFULL OF POISON YET AND WATHER OTHER WAYS OUT OF THE SITUATION AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ONE I'M REFERRING TO IS JUST JUST RUN YET YELL MY MOTIVATION IS TYPICALLY IF YU JUST GET THIS DONE WE'RE DONE IN A COUPLE O INUTES JUST GET DONE LIKE DON'T GO HERE FOR NOTHNG TO DO IT UENT YOU SHOW UP CHECK CAN ANT'S OVER REALLY QUICKLY BREATHING DOWN REGULATION AFTER HUNDRED PER CENT YOU HAVE TO RIGHT IT'S EASY TUGEKY SO IF YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN'T DO IT DO IT EVERY TH WEK THAT'S TWICE MONTH YOU E TWICE MONTH CAN BE DONE ON THE ROAD CAN BE DONE AT TWENTY MINUTES LIKE DO REALLY GOOD THOROUGH WARM UP DON'T JUST JUMP INTO THOSE BY THE WAY RIGHT AWAY IT'S NOK CAN BE AS BENEFICIAL REALLY NICE GOOD SWEAT BROK I REALLY GOD WARM UP AND THEN GIVE ME FOUR MINUTES O HARD WORK OF ORE DONE RIGHT GET OUT O THERE I'M IF YOU WANT TO USE LIKE A BATH OR HOT FIRMOLSTRESS TO KIND LIKE EIGHT IN THAT WARM UP PROCESS FIND GETTIN US ON I GETTING A HOT BATH GE REALLY HOT GET UP THERE WARM UP NOCK IT OUT TWHOLE THING IS TWENTY MINUTES POST FIVE MIS BREATHING YOU ROUT IM MON ST AUR DOING THIS IT'S SO BUT YOU HOT A PIKE RIGHT THERE  I'VE GOT ELS SORT EVEREEVERY ROOM IN THIS TUDIOIS AS HE EVERY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IT SEEMS SO I WANT THAT ONCE A WEEK RELISTICALLY EVERY T WEEK IF I HAVE TO I WANT THAT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PIECE CALL IT WHAT EVER YOU WANT LONG DURATION THING ID DEALLY YOU'LL DO AS MUCH O THAT TOUGHYOUR KNOSE ONLY YOU NOC  MELL DO THE NTERVAL STUFF IT KNOWS ONLY THE MEN OF DON'T NEN TRY BUT IF YOU CAN GO THAT WHOLE THIRTY MINUTE TIME OR TWENTY OR FORTY MINUTES WHENEVER ITS CAN TO BE I'M THAT'S ACTUALLY GOOD WAY TO REGULATE INTENSITY SO GO ES HARD AS YOU CAN WI'LL STILL BEING ABLE TO BRETH THOUGH YOU KNOWS ONLY IF YOU HAVE TO OPEN UP YOUR MOUTH A LITTLE BIT FINE BUT TRY TO STAY THERE WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS VERY QUICKLY YOU'LL BEABLE TO INCREASE YOUR WORK OUT PUT WHILE JUST BRINGING THERAILS WHICH HAS A BUNCH OF OTHER BE ONT TO BENEFITS THE OTHER PIECE I WANT IS THIS MIDDLE GROUND WHICH IS CAN YOU SUSTAIN HARD WORK FOR AT TO TWELVE MAYBE AS LITTLEAS FOUR MINUTES I'LL GIVE YOU FOUR TO TWELVE MINUTES IS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE QUITE AS HIGH AS THE FIRST ONE YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET TO HART IN MAX BUT CAN YOU GET SOMEWHERE IN THE EIGHT PERCENT RANGE AND CAN YOU HOLD THAT FOR FOUR MINUTES MAYBE GIVE ME TWO MINUTES TWO MINUTES O REST AND DO THAT TWICE SOMETHING LIKE THAT I IDEAL SITUATION IS WHAT A RUNNER WOULD DO IS LIKE WWILL ALL MILE REPEATS CAUSE HEY'RE RUNNING FOUR OR FIVE MINUTE MILES WHATEVER TIME IT TAKES THIM TO FINISH THEYE CALD ARREST THAT SO TO ONE TO ONE WORK TO RESTARATIO SO FIVE MINUTE MILE REST FIVE MINUTES AND GO AGAIN THAT'S PROBABLY PRETTY UNREALISTIC FOR A LOT OF FOLKS SO THAT WELL THE FIVE MINUTE PART IS UNREALISTIC FOR MOST OS EVER MAY OUD BE IN A EIGHT MINUTESEIGHT MINUTES FINE PROBABLY SOMETHING LIKE THATNAR PARTICULAR CASE JUST DO THEIGHT HUNDRED METER SO DO EIGHT OR METERS YOU SOMETHING THAT TAKES TWO TO SIX MINUTE TO WORK I' IT IS A LOWER INTENSITY THAN THE MAX OF BUT IS A MUCH HIGHER WORK LOAD I'M THAT IS PROBABLY GOING TO GIVE YOU YOU MIGHT EVEN ARGUE THE MOST CARN OF ASK YOUR BENEFIT BECAUSE IT IS SUSTAINED WORK OUT PUT AND THAT'S VERY CRITICAL THE DOWNSIDE OF KIND O LIKE THAT  CONVERSATIONAL PACE IT'S PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IT'S MOVEMENT IT'S BLOOD FLOW WITH EMPHATIC DRAINAGE IT'S NOT VERY CARD OF ASKERLI CHALLENGING TE YOUR YOU'RE JUST NOT GIN TO GET AN OPTIMLE HEALTH RM JUST WALKING ACTIVELY SO TWO TO SIX MINUTES OF A HARD WORK OF HARD WORK WITH THEN AN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF REST IN BETWEEN THEN THEN REPEAT HOW MANY TERMS ONCE IF YOU HAVE TO IF YOU NEDS TO BE ONE RAP IF AN EASY BE A SIX MINUTE THING AND THEN DOWN RIGGLY BREATH TWICE IF YOU CAN DO THAT SIX TIMES EIGHT TIMES LIKE WHATEVER WHATEVER YOU CAN REALLY DO AND YOU CAN JUST TAKE THAT THOS LONG OF THE TRAINING SESSION AS YOU WANT OR SHORT I'M EXERCISE CHOICE CAN BE WHAT EVE WOU WANT SO AGAIN YOU CAN DO SLOD PUSHES OR COULD BE A KETTLE BELL CIRCUIT OR ANY COMBINATION OF THINGS WHERE YOU'RE JUST YOU'R WORKING ANDYOU'RE NOT GIVING YOURSELF AN BREAK YOU HAVE GOT TO BE ABLE TO HOLD ON AT A VERY HIGH WASTE PRODUCT PRODUCTION LEVEL TAS WELL AS A HIDE DEMAND FOR ENERGY AND THEN BRING IT DOWN AND BREATHING DURING THIS TWO TO SIX MINUTES OF A HARD A OUTPUT IS MAINLY THROUGH THE NOSE OR COMBINATION KNOS AND MOUTH REA TAT GETTING TOO TECHNICAL WELLS PROBABLY LIKE I LIKE IT BUT YOU TELL ME IF ITS SO TECHNICAL I'M YOU'R GING TO TRY TO MAINTAIN NASEL ONLY AS MUCH AS YOU CAN BUT YOU CAN LOSE IT A SOME POINT I'M IS YOU YOUN GO THROUGH THER BRYAN AN AND ROBS OUR SYSTEM AND LEARN MORE AND YOU CAN SENT COINSEE WHAT YOU'RE O BE IN IF YOU HAVE TO GO NOSE IN MOUTH OUT OR SOETHING LIKE THAT BUT I DON'T REALLY CARE TO MUCH HONESTY IN THAT RANGE I'M GETTING MOST OF MY NEES ONLY STUFF AT NIGHT AND TRAINING IN EVERYTHING SO IF YOU HAVE TO OPEN UP THE THROTTLE THERE TO GET THE WORK DONE THAT'S O  OH THEN NOBLE ACTUALLY GO TO YOUR ANSE YOUR QUESTION WHICH WAS MUSTI AN DURENTES OGO BACK THAT PIECE MUSKGER ENDURANCE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR GENERAL MAINTENANCE OF COINT HEALTH AN OTHER WORDS I'M YOU HAVE GOT FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION RIGHT IT'S A VERY CLASSIC SCIENCE HE PHYSIOLOGY SAYING MEANING YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT THERE'S A BUNCH BUT TO MAKE IT EASY TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSCLE FIBRES FAST TWITCH AND SLOW TWITCH FASTER FIBERS TEND TO BE BUT THERE NOT ALWAYS BIGGER THEY CONTRACT WIT T A HIRE VELOCITY IT'S WHY THEY RECALLED FASTWITCH BUT THEY TEND TO BE MORK LIKE LITIC AND THUS FATIGABLE SLOW TWITCH ARE TEND TO BE SMALLER THEU'LL NOT ALWAYS THEYARE MORE PACT IT MINE OF CONTRARY THERE WERE GENERALLY BETTER IT BURNING FAT AS YOUILL BUT CONTRACT ITH LOWER VELOCITY WELL WE HAVE THESE TWO TYPE SO THAT WE CAN REGULATE FUNCTION MOR YOU HAVE SOME MUSCLE GROUPS THAT WERE GOING TO SOR I WE GO BACK UP A QUICK SECONDEACH INDIVIDUAL MUSCLE IN A HUMAN BODY HAS A COMBINATION OF SOME AMOUNT OF FAST AND SOME MONOSLOW THAT PERCENTAGE OF FAST FORS SLOW DIFFERUS FROM MUSCLE THO MUSCLE SO IT ALSO DIFFERES FROM PERSON TO PERSON EASY EXAMPLE IS YOUR CALF MUSCLTHERE'S THERE'S THREE BUT THERE'S TWO PRIMARY MUSCLS IN YOUR CALF WONCE ALL THE SOLELIEST ONE'S A GASTROG THE THE GASTROCT IS ONE OR IF YOU TAKE YOUR TOE AND POINT AT TOWARD YOUR FACE AND THEN FLECTS THAT'S TE ONE THAT POPS OUT YOUAN ON THE MEDIAL SIDE THE INSIDE THE SOLELIEST TA WE CALL AN ANTI GRAVITY MUSCLE AND IT IS GENERALLY ABOUT EIGHTY PER CENT TO EVE NINETY PER CENT SLOW TWITCH AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE CONTRACTED LIGHTLY ALL TIME SMUST BE ON PERMANENTLY IT'S IT'S MAN TO KEEP YO WE CALL IT ANTI GRAVITY CAUSE IT'S MEANT TO KEEP YOU ERECT UP AND MOVING YOURE SPINAL ERECTORS SUPPOSED TO DO THIS VARIOUS MUSCLES FOR POSTURAL OR ARE GENERALLY SLOPE WICH MUSCLES SORECSES BE ON ALL TIMES NOT PRODUCE FAST NOT PRODUCE FORCE BUT DON'T GET TIRED THE GAS ROCK IS THE OPPOSITE IT'S NOT ACTIVATED VERY OFTEN BUT HONE I'S ACTIVATIS IT'S MEANT FOR EXTREME PREPULSION THIS GIVES US THE ABILITY TO REACH UP AND SCRATCH OUR EYE BALL AND ALSOL PUNCH SOMEBODY RIGHT WE HAVE TO BIL TO REGULATE FORESALP BUT WHICH IS GOING BACK TO HENAMAN RIH CONTROLLING WHAT WE USE WHEN WE DON'T USE WHILE ALSO NOT WASTING ENERGY WHICH IS THE THE DOWNSIDE OF ACTIVATING A BIG THRESHOLD MOTOR NON IS IT'S IT REQUIRES A TON OF ENERGY I'M SO MORE EFICIENT MOTE OFE ENERGY BUT THE TOTAL AMOUNT IS REALLY REALLY HIGH SO MUSCULAR EN DURANCE IS GOING TO HELP THOSE SLOW TWITCH MUSCLE FIBERS AND SLOW TWITCH PREDOMINANT MUSCLES MAINTAIN THEY'RE WORKING JOB SO IF YOU LOSE YOUR MUSCULAR ENDURANCEABILITY IN YOUR SPINAL ERECTORS ARE YOUR CALF OUAGAINST OUR SLUMPING INTO BAD POSITIONS YOURE GING TO BE GETTING A PUTTING JOINTS IN IN AM MOVEMENT PATTERN THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE TH MOST HAPPY WIT SO IT'S MORE THAN ABOUT THAN BE ABLE TO DIS MAINTAIN A TWO MINUTE LOSQUAT IT'S ABOUT MAINTAINING JOINTEGRITY AND ALLOWING THAT MUSCULAR TURE TONNOT FATIGUE WHEN YOU ASK IT TO DO HEAVY AND FAST SO WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS YOU'VE GOT A WHOLE COMBINATION OF MUSCLES IN YOUR SHOULDER AND WE WILL JENLYCOLTES LIKE THE ROAD TEATER COFF MUSCLES WELL LET'S IMAGINE THOSE SLOW TWITCH POSTURAL MUSCLES GET FATIGUED AND THEY STRACT TO LOSE CONTRACT TI'LE TENTION AND THEN YOU TO DO SOMETHING HEAVY OR FAST OR AN INMURG SITUATION THOSE ARE ALREADY PREE FATIGUED YOU CAN RELYING MORE UPON THE FAST WICH MUSULFIBRES WHICH ARE THERE LESS FOR POSTURAE INTEGRITY YOU'RE LIKELY TO GET OUT A POSITION AND THIS IS A WHOLE RECIPE OF LIKE CO WIS MY SHOW THEIR IS HURTING GOT MY BACK THAT'S VERY OFTIN A CASE OF THE SOLDI WICH FIBRES THE SULCIES MUSCELE GROUPS LOSING MUSCULAR NDURANCE SO NEEN TO BUILD THAT BACKOP SO THAT THEY CAN CONTROL AND HOLD THE JOINT IN THE POSITION N SO THE FAST WHICH FIBERS ICANINCONTRACTED FORCE I'M HOPING THAT WHAT I'M TO SAY NEXT MEATS OF WHAT YOU SAID A ACCURATELY MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT GETTING INJURED A LIFTING WAGS OR EVEN DOING HOUSE WORK OR YARD WORK ALMOST ALWAYS HAPPENS WHEN I'M NOT PAYING ATTENTION FATIGUED THAT'S KIND OF OBVIOUS BUT ALSO GETTING INPOSITION TO INITIATE A MOVEMENT SETTING DOWN AWEIGHT OR LIFTING WEIGHTS OFF THE RACK OR OR PICKING UP DUNBELLS THAT'S ALMOST ALWAYS WHEN I SEEM TO ACTIVEATE THIS LOWER BACK THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY YOU KNOW NEARLACE OR EIGHT MONTHS AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY IS THAT THIS MUSCULAR ENDURANCE FROM WALLSITS OR PLANKS OR THNGS OF THAT SORT MAY BE GOGIVE US A FEW OTHER EXAMPLES HE OF OF THESE CAN HELPLUSS BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY PREPARE THE SYSTEM TO DO WHAT WE NORMALLY THINK OF US THE MORE INTENSE WORK SO IT'S IT'S REALLY THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE ITS REALLY THE ARCHITECTURE OF OF THE BODY TATINCLUDES NERVES AND MUSCLES ANDEVERYTHING ELSE OF COURSE THAT LET'S THEGUE LIMBS AND ANOTHER KIND OF ACTION END OF THE BODY DO DO ITS BEST WORK SO YE LETIT ITREST ITS OWN POWER AND FORCE YET WE'VE ECTUALY LANDED ON ONE OF MY FINAL LAWS OF STRENGTH CONDITION WHICH IS SIMILAR TO ONE I SETER TER RIGHT SO I SAID EXERCISES DO NOT DETERMINE ADAPTATIONS APPLICATION DETERMINES AT APTATION SO SOUND SIMILAR BUT IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT THERE ARE NO GOOD OR BAD EXERCISES THERE'S ONLY GOOD OR BAD APPLICATION HERE'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT MY SO YOU DI NOT GET HURT DEAD LIFTING BECAUSE DEADLIFS ARE DANGEROUS YOU ONLY GET HURT DEAD LIFTING BECAUSE YOU EITHER GOT IN BAD POSITION YOU GOT BAD POSITION BECAUSE YOUEITHER STARTED IN BAD POSITION THIS IS ONE OF THING YOU JUST SAID OR YOU ENDED UP IN BAD POSITION YOU DID TOO MUCH VOLUME YOU DID TOO MUCH INTENSITY OR YOU DID TOO MUCH COMPLEXITY THOSE LAST THREE THINGS ALL HURT YOU BECAUSE THEY RESULT IN THE FIRST ONE WHICH IS OUT OF POSITION OR ANOTHER WAY THINK ABOUT THIS IF IS NOT  A A INVISIBLE CHANGE IN POSITION IS STRESS GOT PUT INTO A PART OF THE SYSTEM THAT SHOULD NOT ABSORB THAT MUCH STRESS SO YOU DID TOO MUCH OF IT YOU DID IT TOO HEAVY YOU GOT FATIGUED AND SO YOU BROKE POSITION YOU GOT TOO HEAVY SEE YOU BROKE POSITION YOU YU MADE THE EXERCISE TOO COMPLEX YOU PUT TOO MANY MOVING PARTS IN IT YOU PUT TOO MANY JOINTS IN IT AND YOU GOT ON A POSITION YOU DID THAT TOO MANY TIMES OVER TIME NOW WE'VE LED FOR EITHER IN ACUTE INJURY BAM YOUR BACK POPS AND YOU FORONFLOOR OR DISLIKE MAN AS THING IS HURRING OVER TIME ALL THESE THE RESULT THE SAME THING SO YOU CANNOT EVER BLAME THE EXERCISE FOR CAUSING THE PROBLEM IS ALWAYS EITHER THE USER OR THE COACH YOU PROGRAMME TO WAY TOO MUCH HERE AND I CAN'T HANDLE THAT POSITION OR YOU YOURSELF WHENT INTO I TOO MUCH SO IF YOU'RE GETTING IS LITTLE TWEKS AND IN PROBLEMS GOING ON YOU'VE MADE AN ERROR IN ONE OF THOSE THINGS SO SIMPLY BACK OFF REDUCE THE COMPLEXITY RIGT IM GOV YOURSELF MORSTABILITY LESS MOVING PARTS DO LESS VOLUME DO LESS INTENSITY IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE PEOPLE FROM THE PHYSICAL FARUPY WORLD IN TERMS OF THE PAIN LITERATURE IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT JUST STOPPING A MOVEMENT IS VERY RARELY GOING TO WORK  BUT YOU WANTED TO WAS BACK OFF ALL THE WAY DOWN TO JUST BELOW THAT THRESHOLD OF THAT'S WHAT AGGRAVATES IT AND YOU WANT A  TRAIN RIGHT THERE THAT'S GOING ALLOW YOU TO DO TWO THINGS AND WE ONE TISSUE TOLERANCE AND THE NUMBER TWO DEESENTINIZATION A LOT OF PAIN SUFFAND YOU CAN PROME SPEAK A LOT ABOUT THIS IS ESPECIALLY THINGS LIKE LOW BACK PAIN IS THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY OFTEN MUCH DAMAGE THERE IT'S A LOT OF HYPERCENTITIZATION I'V JUST PAINSING A PAIN SIGNAL OH MANTING THE MOVEMENTIRELY DOES NOT GET THAT SIGNAL TICL WHY YOU NEED O TRAIN JUST BELOW THAT SIGNAL AND DESENSITIZE IT SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MUSKA ENDURANCE ALLOWAS YOU YOU'E JUST PUTTING VOLUME RIGHT BELOW WHERE YOU STARN TO GET A TWIK AND IT IS BEAUTIFULLY EFFECTIVE FOR THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED THIS RIGHT SIDE LOWER BACKPAINT FOR YEARS SOMETIMES SHOOTING DOWN THE HIP THE TWO THINGS TAT REALLY HELPED A WE'RE DOING ANTER TO WORK SO YOU A HAT'S OFF TO NEESE OVER TOS SKY AND PATRICK WHO HAS'T OUNO CRATE A LOT OF POPULARITY ROUND Y AM TIB WORK BUT I TURNS OUT JOINTS FULL RANGE A MOTION YOUARE ABOTTE SPOT YETHE SOMETHING ABOUT STABLIZING THE STUFF FROM THE KNEE DOWN HELP MY BACK AND THEN ALSO SOME SOME NECKWORK AND A FRIEND'S MIN ARE ALWAYS TEASING ME THAT MY GIM IS FILLED WITH T THE MOST BAZAAR EQUIPMENT INNA DOESN' LOOK LIKE ANY OTHER TA LOT OF IS JUST DESIN TO KEEP ME HEALTHY AN AND STILL TRAINING BUT A I LOVE THIS IDEA OF OF GETTING RIGHT AT THE BELOW THE THRESHOLD OF PAIN ACTIVATION AND NOT SIMPLY GOING INTO TO COMPLETE A NON ACTION OR JUST TAKING NEARLY RASK AS THAT ACTION CAN BE DETRIMENTAL A I'D LOVE TO TALK ABOUT A FEW ITEMS THAT SUPPORT TRAINING OF ALL KINDS AND WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION AND INDEED A MISCONCEPTION AND MYSTERY AND JUST GET YOUR TAKE ON THESE AND AND I JUST WANT ACKNOWLEDGE AT THE OUTSET THAT FOR SOME OF THESE THERE'S A LOT OF SCIENCE FOR SOME OF THEM THERE'S LESS SCIENCE BUT THERES CERTAINLY IS A LOT OF AM EXPERIENCE  IN IN YOUR CAMPAN AND THOSE CATEGUORIES OR COLD HEAT AND HYDRATION AH BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WHETHER NOT YOUR RUNNER OR WHETHER NOT YOUR STRAING TRAINING YOU'RE HUMAN BEING I YOU NEEN TO HYDRATE A BUT IN TERMS OF WORK OUTPOT AND A PHYSICAL WORK OUT WHAT MAY BE INCOGNIVE WORK OUT BUT MAY WE TACKLE HYDRATION FIRST I THERE IS WHAT I WHAT I CALL A I THINK IS NOW COME TO BE KNOWN AS THA THE GALPING EQUATION WHICH UM YOU REALLY DO DESERVE CREDIT FOR BECAUSE I THINK THAT PEA PILL AM REALIZE THAT THERE ARE RANGE OF SOLUTIONS OUT THERE BUT THERE IS A REALLY A DESPERATE NEED FOR A STRAIGHT FORWARD SOLUTIONS THAT WORK FOR SEVENTY FIVE PER SEVEN PEOPLE SEVETY FIVE PER CENT OF THE TIME SO HIDRATION IS KEY BABBE YOU COULD UNDER SCORE JUST HOW HOW KEY IT IS FOR US AND THEN WHAT IS THE GALOPAN EQUASION AS AS I CALL IT THAT I THINK OTHERS ARE NOW REFERRING TO IT YE IGET I'M  BENEFITS IFIDRATION SLASH CONSEQUENCES OF A MISHIDRATION SO WE THAT SEHYDRATION ROMYOU PHYSIOLOGY HAS OR MEDICCURVS MY NAT TIVE BLY THY WE THINK ABOUT THIS INTROMSTOXICOLOGY SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS AT SOME POINT GIVING YOU A DOSE OF SOMETHING A TESTOSTRONS VERY EASY EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE CLINICALLY DEFICIENT OR LOW INTO STOSTRON AND I GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT IN I BRINGS YOU BACK NO NORMAL RANGE YOU GENERALLY SEE AN IMPROVEMENT IN HEALTH AND FUNCTIONALITY TAKING YOU THOUGH FROM NORMAL TO SUPERHIND DOESN'T ALWAYS NECESSARILY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BENEFIT IN FACT IF YOU CONTINUE TO GO ITS CAN OT PROVIDE DETROMEN RAD SO EVERYTHING HAS IS CUR AND THEN SOME THINGS ARE HORMETIC STRESSERS WHICH MEANS I GAV A SMALL SHORT FAST INSULT IS ACTUALLY BENEFICIAL BECAUSEIN YOU COME BACK BIGGER FASTER I STRONGER AND THAT'S HOW I APTATION WARKS BASICCOR MES OCAME HIDRATIONS THE SAME WAY SO AT THE END THE CURVE HERE IF YOU ARE UNDER HYDRATED BY ALL KNOW YOU COULD DI RIGHT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THINGS IN FACT  WATER IS THE ONLY THING THAT IS YOU BIQUITOUS ACROSS BIOLOGIS IN TERMS OF EVERY LIVING THING HAS TO HAVE IT THERE'S NO OTHER VIDEM IN MINERAL NEUTRIAN THAT IS REQUIRED AMONG ALL LIVING THINGS WITH EXCEPTION OF WATER SO THAT YOU IVE YOU A PRETTY GOOD INDICATION OF IT'S IMPORTANTE RIGHT LIKE YOU GT A HAVE THIS THING DOWN HERE THE BOTTOM IF YOU'R D HYDRATED I GIVE YOU MORE ITS BENEFICIAL EFFECTS HOWEVER IF YOU ARE UP THE TOP ALREADY AND I CONTINUE TO GIVE YOU MORE WATER PASS THAT NOW WE RUN INTO ACTUAL PROBLEMS AND WE CAN GIVE WHAT'S CALLED HAMP ON A TREMIUM IT'S MORE COMMON THAN PEOPLE REALIZE ITHE TREMIA BEING ACTUALLY NOT REFERRING THE WATER BUT THAT THE SODIUM CONCENTRATION BEING TOO LOW AND YOU'VE PROBABLY TALKED ABOUT THAT A LENGTH OF OF WHY THAT'S AN ISSUE IF SODYAN BATASCIUM BALANCES INSIDE OUTSIDE SELL COME OFF YOU HARTSTOPS I MUSTL CONTRACTION ENDS AN ALL THESE SING SOME SO YOU DON'T WANT TO BE OVER OR UNDER HY DRATED SO UNDERSTANDING THE THIS ROUGH EQUATION I SO OF LOOSELY CALCULATED ONE DAY IS HELPFUL FOR THAT I'M I THINK THE MOST CONTEX IS IS TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH WATER TO DRINK THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND HOW MUCH WATER TO DRINK DURING EXERCISE SO THE THE VERY EASY ANSWER IS HALF YOUR BODYWEIGHTEN OUNCES PER DAY IS A VERY LOOSE GUIDE LANE FOR TOTAL AMOUNT OF FLUID CONCUMPTION SO IF YOU A TWO HUNDRED POUNDS AIM FOR A HUNDRED OUNCES OF WATER I GA VERY EASY NUMBER IF YOU HIT THAT YOU PROBLY OSY NINETY PER CENTI OURE GOOD NIGHT PRESENT THE TIME ALONE IF YOU THEN GO TO EXERCISE YOU NEEDTO TAN ACCOUNT FOR THAT FLUID LOSS WITH EXERCISE AND IN GENERAL YOU WANT TO CONSUME A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PER CENT TO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PER CENT OF THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT YOU LOST IN FLUID ANOTHER WORDS IF YOU WORKED OUT AND YOU WERE TWO HUNDRED POUNDS NAKED AND YOU AN DID YOUR WORK OUT AND YOU DRIED OFF AND YOU WEIGHEDYOURSELF AGAIN AND NOW YOU'RE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT POUNDS YOU LOST TWO POUNDS OF WATER AS THIRTY TWO OUNCES YOU WANT TO DRINK BACK ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THAT SO STAID OF DRINKING THIRTY TWO OUNCES I WANT YHOULD DRINK FORTY FORTY TWO FORTY FIVE LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS I'S ONEOF THE REASONS WHY IS UNLESS YOU'RE DRINKING SOMETHING THAT IS I'VE SO TONIC MEANING THE SAME EXACT CONCENTRATION IN YOUR BLOOD  THAT YOU'R IN YOUR FLUID YOU'RE JUST GINGTO GO CLOSER THAT HYP WENTER TREMIA IYOU'REGONG TO GET A BUNCH OF BARER EFECTOR REFLECT RESPONSES AND YOU'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY THINK YOU HVE TO MUCH FLUID AN YOU CAN YOU'RE NEIHT IT OUT WITS I' NOT WEIGHING MYSELF BEFORE AN AFTER WORK OUTS AND OM IS THERE A SHORT HAND VERSION OF THIS THAT IYOU KNOW AFTER TRAINING FOR AN HOUR I SHOULD DRINK AT LEAST EXREVOUNCES YET THAT ASSUMING IT'S AT AT CAT OF IT'STALLERA YOU NO I'M NOT SWEATING SUPERHEAVILY YEI IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE YOU COULD PROBABLY GOS SOMETHING LIKE IF EVERY ONE IN THE WORLD DIS IL TWELVE TO TWENTY OUNCES THAT'S PROBABLY  PRETTY DECENT AND THEY'RE PROBABLY DOING THAT YE YE AND WHENT OOT ELECTUROLIGHTS AID CONSUMING SALT PATASSIUM AND BUTBUT THAT THING ONLY WORKS THOUG IF YOU'RE COMING IN AT OFP THE MIDRATION THEN THIS IS THE PROBLEISE IS WHY YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO FLAG THIS STARTING WITH A GOOD TOTAL DAILY MYTO WATER BECAUSE IF IF YOU'RE COMING IN AND YOU'RE LIKE ALL I DRINK TWO OR THREE GLASS OF WATER A DAY THEN YOU MIGHT WE NEED TO RINK FIFTY OR SIXTY OUNCES POSTWORK OUT COULD YOURE WEIG BEHIND SO THAT LIKE ALL TWELVE OUNCES OR SO WORKS IF YOU'RE ALREADY GENERALLY VERY WELL HIDRATED AND IF PEOPLE ARE DRINKING YOUON'T FOR TO SIX GLASSES OF WATER ADAY BUT THEY'RE ALSO DRINKING A LOT OF KAFFINE IN ANY FORM THAN THEY'RE GOING TO BE XCREETING WORE WATER IN MOST CASES RIGHT WELL BECAUSE KAFFINES OF DIARATIC OK KINNY IS BUT KINNI ISN'T EITHER IT'S NOT THE DIARETIC THAT WE USED TO THINK ABOUT IT AS IM IT IS STILL FLUID CONSUMPTION SO IT'S ONLY A DIARETIC IF IT CAUSE YOU TO SCREET MORE FLUID THAN ACTUALLY WAS BEING ANTIC SO IM IF KAFFIN IN TAKE IS IN A NORMAL RANGE I DON'T I DN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE DIARETIC EFFECTS IF SOME ONE IS DRINKING TWELVE CUPS OF COFFEE DAY IT WORK WORK AN ORTHER TAKING KAFFINE PILLS OR SOMETHING NOW THE EXCRETION IS GON OUT KICKED THA COVERAGE SO NOW WE'RE NOW PROBBS RECAUS THRE'S NO FLUID CONSUMPTION WITH THE AFFINE PILL SO IN GENERAL THINGS LIKE TEA SUMPTION I'M NOT SUPERWORRIED ABOUT THOSE THINGS YOU CAN COUNT THOSE TORTURE TOTA TOTAL FLUID AND TAKE IF YOU WANT S IF YOU'RE LIKE I DRINK SIXTY OUNCES OF WATER BLUS TWENTY OUNCES OF COFFEE AND THEN NOW THIS I YOU CAN AD NOT ALL LAPPEN YOURE TO BE TOTALLY O K SO NATURAL FOR YOU ALSO HAVE PROBS WITH SYNTHETIC FORMS OF KAFFIN WERS NATURAL FORMS OF KAFFINE NATURAL FORMS ARE ARE A PRETTY O K YOUE LOST NOY ET CETERA YE ALL THAT SETTLE FORM AS WERE IT GETS DRINKY ALWAYS LIKE E ALWAYS RIGHT SO  GENERAL I EAT REAL FOOD AND THINGS YOU BE JUST FIND I'M THE LAST PIEST TO CONSIDER IS YOU'RE DIET QUALITY MATTERS BECAUSE I THE FLUID CONTENT IN YOUR FOOD CAN VERY WILDLY SO SOMETHING LIKE A BAGAL IM MIGHT BE YOU FIVE TO TEN PER CENT WATER OR SOMETHING LIKE A WATER MELLON IS NINETY EIGHT PER CENT NINETY FIVE PER CENT SOMETHING IN A HUGE RAINT EVEN MEAT IS VERY HIGH PER CENTAGE A FLUID IN TIKE I GET TO REALLY HIGH EVEN AFTER YOU COOK IT THERE STILL A LOT OF FLOD IN THERE SO IF YOU'RE EATING A WHOLE FOOD MOSTLY WHOLE FOOD BASEDYET YOU'RE IN DOGENOUS HYDRATION IS ACTUALLY PRETTY HIGH ALREADY JUST FROM YOUR FLOD IF YOU'RE EATING A VERY HIGHLY PROCESS DE HIDRATED OVERSALTED DIET YOU'VE YOU'R WAY LOW ON HYDRATION JUST IN YOUR FOOD SO YOU HAVE TO FACT OR ALL THESE THINGS IN A FACT ONE THINGS THAT HAPPENS TO US CONSTANTLY WITH FOLKS THAT GO FROM A LIKE HIGHLY PROCESS LOW QUALITY DIET TO A HIGH QUALITY ONE IS IT JUST TE JUST PEAN ON STOP LIKE WHAT THE HLLS GOING ON LIKE WILL YOU'RE ACTUALLY HAVE BROUGHT IN SIXTY IDITIONAL ANCES O WATER AN YOU'R DIET RELATIVE OF WHAT YOU USED TO HAVE AND YOU'VE GONE FROM TEN GRAMS IS SODIUM THERE TO FOUR TO TWO SOMETIMES ONCE SOMETIMES YEIT'S A VERY LOW CAUSE YOU'RE NOT LIKE SALT ARE YOU SALTING YOUR FOOD NO OK A WELL WE DON'T HAVE SODYMEN TAKE THAT LIKE WER WEIGH DOWN SO EVERYTHING THAT WERE CONSIDERING I'S BASED ON THUTS LETS AS SUME SOME ONE'S EATING A A PRETTY WELL BALANCED I AT THEIR DRINKING SIXY ANCES O WATER N MAY BE GAFFY IN COFFEE IN TO E THINGS LIKE THAT IM WE DON'T EXACTLY KNOW THE OTAL AMOUNT OF SODIUM ONESHUN AND TAKE IT IS VERY CLEAR HIGH SODIUM CONCENTRATIONS ARE STILL ASSOCIATED WITH A LOT OF NEGATIVE HEALTH OUT COMES ESPECIALLY IN COMBINATION WITH POR PHYSICA ACTIVITY AND COMBINATION WITH LOWFUL QUALITY AND ALL THER COMOBINITIES THAT'S A VERY BAD THING YOU NEED BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THOSE THINGS I'M IF EVERYTHING ELSE IS O KA WE'ROL CAPE PLAYING OF THE LITTLE BUT HIGHER SALTS IN FACT YOUR YOU'RE PROBING TO FEEL BETTER YOU EUN TO FEL GENERALLY PRETTY GOOD IM YOU JUST IT SEENS TO BE VERY CLEAR IF YOU ARE OVER WEIGHT HIGHLY STRESSED AND YOU DON'T HAVE ELOT OF THSE THINGS TICKED OFF AND YOU HAVE KNOWN CORMOBIDITIES YOU REALLY NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO SALT AN TAKEIT CAN BE VERY NASTY I'M SO THAT BEING SAID WHAT WERE GENERALLY GOING TO LOOK AT FOLKS IS ARE YOU AT LEAST CAN WE CATEGRISE YOU IS A LOW SODIUM OR HIGH SODIUMSWATER IF SO THERE'S A WHOLE LIST OF ELECTROLIGHTS YOU CAN LOOK A THAT ARE GONG TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE TWO HUNDRED O FOREIGN MILIGRAMS PERSERVING THERE'S A WHOLE LIST O THESE THINGS I'M IF YOU'RE LOW SODIUM SWEAT ARE YOU'RE UNPROBIGANA SEND YOU AFTER ONE OF THOS IF YOU'RE HIGH SODIUM SWEDER THRE'S A LOT OF ELECTR LIE SUPPLEMENTSTHAT ARE CLOSER TO SIX OR EIGHT HUNDRED EVEN EVEN A WHOLE GRAM I'M PERSINGLE SERVING SIZE SO YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH THAT I'M A VERY YOU KNOW IF YOURE LOW SODIUM MOR HIGH SODIUMS SOEDER WE ASH AVE AT EPISODE ON SALT WE PUT OUT DEAT UM WORS COMING OUT SOON IF HASN'T COME OUT ALREADY WHICH IS I YOU KNOW WHENYO LOOK A THE HAZARD RATIOS YOU HAVE SALT AND TAKE I BASICALLY YOUR PROBABILIT Y OF REALLY BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO YOU GOES WAY UP AS YOU GET TOWARDS YOU'D A LOT OF SODIUM IN TAKING TEN TWELVE GRANDS O A DAY AND IM IT AND THIS IS TRANSLATE TE TEASPOONS OF SAULT ET CETERA BUT ALSO VERY LOW SODYOUMAN TAKE IS A PROBLEM NO CLOVITI I SAY IT'S NOT A PERFECTLY OU SHAPE IT'S CUT OF A JAY SHAPE A GERVER A CUT A HOCKY STICK  SHAPE MORE R LESS BUT I'M HOW WOULD I KNOW IF I'M A LOW SODIUMER HIGH SODIUM WYE SEEIN GOAT IJUST CA WIC MY SWEAT OR HAVE SONGONE ELSE NO HAND THE YOU FIND A SUPERFRIEND WO LICK YOUR SWEAT FOR YOU A SAME WAOW NO NO WILLING VOLUNTEERS THAT I'M AWARE OF BUT WOULD I BE ABLE TO TELL YET I'M YOU CAN GET WHAT TUSTING DONE ACTUALLYOUHAVE A A NUMBER OF OPTIONS I'M THE KINDOF THE ORIGINAL ONE THAT MOST OF US USE IN THE BACKGROUND FOR MANY YEARS AS CALLED LEBYLIN I'M THEY'LL SEND YOU OUT A LITTLE PATCH A WEARE THAT AND IN THE LAB AND TH THEY'LL MEASURE AT DIRECTLY LAV I SENT A BACK IS A HUNDRED AN FIFTY BUCK SIR DOY BENYU INTO LOW MEDIUM AN HIGH SEMANY THE'REGET AT DO THAT BUTHERE ON TG GO YOU VERY THERE CAN TO TELL YOUEXACTLY THE MILIGRAMS AND ND THE CUND ACTULL TELL YOU LIKE WHAT PRODUCTS AS SUFF AND I'M THAT THEY'RE EXACTLY MATCH DOYOU DO THIS WITH THAT WITH PROFESSIONAL LAUGH WE HAVE MANY TIMES YESTERSON I'M YOU CAN DO A MORE CONSUMER GREAT VERSION GATERAD HAS A PATCH FOR TWENTY FIVE BOCKS YOU CAN GET TWO OF EM YOU CAN PUT THAT CAT PATCH ON YOUR LEFT FOREARM AND DOWN LALL THE GATERA AT AND OU CAN DO A WORK OUT MEASURE RIGHT THERE AND CLICK IT OVER AND THE'LLTELL YOU EXACTLY NOT ONLY HIRELO WITH AGAN THE'LL TELL YOU THE MLIGRAMS OF SODIUM THER'RE IN YOUR SWEAT AND UNIN CAN FIGURE OUT AGAIN CIN A HIGH MEDIUM OR OR JONSTON THERY MUCH BETTER ON AY A SLIGHTLY HIGHER SODIUM IN TAKE MOST BE I'M BUT IN MY COBRHIDRATE I DO ECOBRIDRATES ONE ONE OF THOSE THAT IT IS PRETTY MODERATE BY TRHINAT CLEAN FOOD SO I II' NOTICE AN I TEND TO BE SLIGHTLY LOW BLOOD PRESSURE SO AGAIN TO MITERATE THAT THE WARNING THERE THAT IF SOMEBODY IS A PREHA PRETENSIONOR HAS I PRETENSION N ROBES YOU REALLY DOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR SODYOUMAN TAKE BUT MANY PEOPLE SEEM TO FIND THAT THEY FEEL BETTER WHEN THEY INCREASE OR SODIM IN TAKIN THEYRE STILL IN THAT HEALTHY PORTION OF THE HAVE RATIO MOST OF THE ATHLES I'S A IN GENERAL URNERGO HIGRER IN SALT WHEN THEY COME WEN RUN THE STUFFON WERE HAND SAULT ALM ALMOST ALWAYS A VERY FEW TIMES HAVE I GOT OW WHEN YOU CUT THIS BACK WHEN THE EXCEPTIONATHAT ONCES TAT COME IN TAT HET LIKE PORTING YERELS AN O MI I GET YOUR FIFTEEN MILIGRAMS ARERY FIFTEEN GRAMS A DAY CAUSEYOU'RE EATING NOTHING BUT GARBAGE SO  LIKE WORK TO COME DOWN YOERE TO FILL WAY BETTER AND ALL THIS BLOATING AND EVERYTHING ELSE THATS CAN A HAPPEN GO DOWN'YOUCAN DO THAT THEIRE ACTUOLLY MORE THERE BY L CENSERS THAT ARE COMING OUT I'M THERE ARE NOT A VAILABLE YET BUT THE'RE COMING VERY SOON IN THIS SPACE THER CANG BE IL GIVE YOU REAL TIME MATRICKS ON I'M SALT SO YOU CAN PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE  I HAVEN'T SEEN ONE USE WHEN PERSONALLY SO I DON'T WANT A I'M THISPOUS BUT HOW GOOTER BAT IT IS BUT I KNOW THAT THOSE ARE COMING I FROM  HANDFUL OF COMPANIES AN EASY WAY TO DO IS JUST LOOK AT I'M WEAR HAT OR WEAR SOME SORT OF HEAD BAND OR SOMETHING AND DO YOUR WORK OUT TAKE IT OFF IF YOU SEE A JUST HUGE WHITE BAND OR IF IT'S COMPLETELY CLEAR AND THAT'S CANY TELL YOU BIG WHITE BAND YOU'RE PROBABLY A HIGH SALTSWATER COMPLETELY CLEAR VERY LITTLE COMING OUT THAT'S GREAT AN OUT I CAN SEE THA THE POSTS ON INSTOGRAM NOW PEOPLE SHOWING THERE THE'RE SALT BAND OF FROM FROM FROM SWEATING AIVSY SALT IS IS SO ESSENTIAL FOR SO MANY PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS YOU DO'T HANT TOO HIH E TOO LOW BUT IF YOU'RE LOSING MORE MAKE SENSE YO WOULD NEED TO TAKE IN MORE SO HALF OF MY BODY WAI IN OUNCES AS A JUST FOUNDATION OF OF A FLUID IN TAKE COFFEE AN TEA COULD BE INCLUDED IN THAT BUT THAT SHOULD PROBE MOSTLY WATER OR THINK SIMILAR TO IT IM WHAT AND THEN DURING EXERCISE YOU THE HOW DO I WANT TO THINK ABOUT THIS AGAIN LET'S AY AM A LET'S AY HIM A HIGH SALT OUT PUT THAN ID WANT TO DRINK MAY BE FORTY OUNCEIS WATER WITH OR WORE MORE YET I'LL GET I'LL'LL DO THIS EASIER OM LET'S TALK ABOUT PREE AND MIDNPOSTS SO WHAT TO DRINK PR IF YOU YOU COME IN HAVING HIT THESE RULES YOU'RE DROK AND PRE WORK OUT CAN BE AS LITTLE AS LIKE FIVE OR SIX OUNCES BASILY A COUPLE SIPS OF WATER FINE I'M IF YOU COME IN POORLY HIGHDRATED THAN YOU MAY BE NEED TO GO MORE LIKE TWELVE BUT HERE'S THE DEAL IF YOU START OFF A SESSION IN A BAD SPOT YOU'RE NOK IN A CANP CATCH BACK UP LIKE YOU U JUST YOU'RE YOU'RE IN TROUBLE LET'S SAY YOU COME IN YOU DID YOU FALL A DIRECTION FIVE HUNDRED MILEGRAMS SALT BEFORE FIVE HUNDRED ILEGRAMS AFTER A VERY EASY RULE A PICK WHATEVER SOURCE YOU WANT THAT'S A COUPLE OF SPRINKLES OF TABLE SALT IF YOU WANT HIM A LAND THAT'S FINE YOU'LL HAVE TWO HEMILANS ACTUALLY A FAIRLY LOW SODIUM SALT SO'S NOT THE BEST FOR FOR THIS PURPOSES I'M IF YOU'RE HIER SALTERSWATTER LITTLE MORE IF YOU WANT TO GO CHOOSE AN ELECTR LIGHT OF WHICH THERE ARE INFINITE I'M YOU CAN LOOK ON THE PACKET AND I'LL TELL YOU YOU' TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILEGRAMS FOR SERVING OR FOUR HUNDRED OR SIX HUNDRED OR WHENE RAPIDLY BUT AROUND FIVE HUNDRED PRETTY FIVE WHENTERPOSTS IS A VERY GENERAL RULE AND THEN DURING IS THINKS TO YOU I MY FAMOUS GALLOPIN AQUATION NOW THAT IS IS ALL THE WORLD I'LL I DID AS I TOOK THE LITERATURE IN A SAID LCAVE IN GENERAL THE RESEARTH SHOWS PRETTY CLEARLY TWO MILEGRAMS FOR KILEGRAM BODYWAY TOR FIFTEEN MEN AT SEEMS TO PUT YOUIN A PRETTY CON SPOT MOST PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT KILEGRAMS OR MILLIERS SO KIND UST RUN THAT OVER AND THE TURNS OUT IT'S ABOUT YOUR BODY WEIGHT TO BIDE BY THIRTY AN OUNCES LIKE THAT'STHAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO BODY WEIGHIN POUNDS DIVIDED BY THIRTY YE EXACTLY RIGHT SO YOU WEIGHT TWO HUNDRED POUNDS DIVIDE ABY THIRTY AND THAT'S NUMBER MOUNCES YOU KNOWNT TO GO EVERY FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES SO I'M GETTING THAT AMOUNT EVERY FIFTEEN TO YE TWENTY MINUTES THROUGHOUT THE TRAINING YOUAND NOW IN THE WIT ROOM THAT'S PRETTY EASY TO DO YES THEIRE REST INTERVALS BUT YOU PEOPLE WILL NEED TO DO THIS WHILE RUNNING YOUR CYCLING I AND THAT CAN CAUSE A LA BIT OF GASTER DISTRESS YEIF YOU'RE NOT USE TO IT IS I RIGHT YOU CAN YOU CAN LEARN TO RUN WITH IT WITH SOME WATER IN YOUR BELLY YOU HUNDRED PER CENT THE GUT IS VERY TRAINABLE IN A LOT OF DIRECTIONS BUT IN TERMS OF FLUID AS WELL AS CARBAHIDRATE WHICH ANOTHER THING THAT IS GINGTO GET PEOPLE I'M BUT THAT'S THE OUT VERY TRAINABLE IT'LL BE UN COMFORTABLE ANNITURALLY BUT YU'LL YOU'LL QUICKLY GET INTO IT THE BETTER SOLUTION FOR THOSE FOLKS JUST CALM IN HIGH DRADED AN YOU DO MIGHTNOT EVENEN NY WATER YOU COULD PROBABLY PER FORM JUST FINE IM SO THE ONES THAT DON'T HAVE AS MUCH OF AN OPPORTUNITY YOU REALLY HAVE TO EMPHASIZE WALKING IN I'M WE HAV THIS PROBLEM WITH LIKE OUR PROFESSIONAL GOLFERS THER'VE PLENTY OF TIME TO DRINK WATER BUT THERE'S SO FOCUSSED ON THE SHOT AN THERE'S A LOT OF ARYABLES COMING OUT ONCE O HIT THEIR SHOT AND MOVING ON THE NEXT ONE THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT I MEA THER GOING OVER SCORE CARD OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE YARDS AWAY CAN I GO A HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR AN A HALF YARDS CN GO UNDRD E SIX YARD WHAT'S A SLOPE WITHOUT WER WAS THE WIND UP HERE WATS WINT UP THERE WATS ITLIKE IT IS JUST THER JUS  THINKING AND THEY JUST FORGET YOUVEN NOW THEY HAVE FOUR AND A HALF HOURS SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY IMMEDIATELY GET OFF THE COURSE WE GO RIGHT INTO RECOVERY IT'S HARD AS WE POSSIBLY CAN THEY WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNING THE'RE GOOD SPOT WE CRUSH RECOVERY AND NOW'S I CA IF YOU CAN REMEMBER TO DRINK THIS GREGT IF NOT WERE STILL FINE IF IT'S NOT A BIDEAL AND YOU HAVE TIME LIKE IN A A A LIFTER BECAUSE I DOL IT THAT PROBABE FIDERS TO I WE CAN ONLY DRINK SO MUCH IN THE MIL OF A FIGHT I COUPLE SEPS O THERE BUT WE WE CAN'T GO MIX IM TWO MILATER SI CAN YOU GETA COUPLE SIPS AN YET IL YET FORGOTLINE S NO CANI HAPPEN SO WE HAVE TO TAKE MORE MNEPS IS BEFORE AND AFTER SO STRART YOU'R RE COVERY PROCESS IMMEDIATELY AND THEN COME IN THE NEXT DAY THAT'S YOUR WINDOW AND THEN WHATEVERYOU CAN GET IN DURING THE WORK OUT THAT'S FINE TO IF YOU'RE A HIGHER SALT SWEATER SEYT ON FIVE HUNDRED FIVE ON HUNDRED MAY BE O SEVEN FIFTY SEVEN FIFTY IF YOU HAVE A LONGER BOUC OF EXERCISE ESPECIALLY IF IT'S HOT I'M OR HUMID THEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER SOME SALT IN THE WORK OUT AS WELL AND THREE HUNDRED MILEGRAMS TURN THE WORK OUT TOTALLY FINE I'M IT'S A NOUGH IF IT IS A REALLY LONG WORK OUT AND IT'S REALLY HOT YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE POUNDS DURING IT YOU NEED A SPECIFIC STRATITY IF YOU ON'T LOSE LESS THAN A POUND YOU DO'T NEN TO WORY ABOUT IT YOU CAN BE IS NOK N TO BE ENOUGH OF A DETRIMENT FOR YOU REALLY CARE I'M SO THAT'S A KIND OF A ROUGH RULE NOW IF YOU'RE TWO HUNDRED PLUSS POUNDS MAY BE THAT  NUMBER MOVES FROM ONE POUND E TWO POUNDS BUT REALLY THE NUMBER WIL LOOK OUT IS WHAT ONE PERCENT OF YOUR BODYWEIGHT IF YO'R LOSING MORE THAN ONE PERCENT OF YOUR BODYWEIGHT WE NED START CARRYING IF IT'S LESS THN ONE PERCENT IT'S NOT CAN REALLY PAID OUT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE A SO FOR MYSELF IM BECAUSE I DON'T GET SUPERTEDNCLE I DON'T WEAR ANY DEVICEIS BESIDES A RISK WATCH UM TO WHAT I WATCH THANKS I YE DO THE VERY ATTACHED TO THIS WATCERS ATTACHED TO ME I SUPPOSE UM MY BODY WEIGTING POUNDS DIVIDED BY TWO THAT'S WHAT I'M A TRY AND GET ACROSS THE ENTIRE DAY UM AS A COND OF BASE LINE AND THEN MY BODY WEIGH ALL WE N POUNDS DIVIDED BY THIRTY DURING THE WORK OUT Y EVERY FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES THAT I'M GOING TO TRY AND CONSUME THAT AMOUNT AND THEN I DEFINITELY DO BETTER WHEN I INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SAULT THAT I'M TAKING IN AN WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED TO A A FIVE HUNDRED MILGRIMS TO A GRAHAM OF SAULT AM SEVERAL TIMES A DAY ACTUALLY BUT IM NOT EATING THAT OFTAND WHICH LEADS ME TO ANOTHER QUESTION WHICH IS UM I PREFER TO TRAIN FASTED OR SEN ME FASTED MEANING FIRSING IN THE MORNING A H OR WITHIN AN HOUR TWO OF WAKIN WE OVY SEIDIN PASSING WHELE I M UST SLEEP OR HAVING NOT EATEN ANYTHING FOR THREE OR FOUR HOURS BEFORE I JUST FEEL LIGHTER IN TIE MORTER OUR ENERGETIC A IF THAT WORKS FOR ME S THAT O CAR A OR SHOULD I TRY IS IT BETTER TO EAT SOMETHING BEFORE ONE TRAINS PERSONAL PREFERENCE EASY EASY ANSWER THERE IT DEPENDS ON OF COURSE HOW HARD YOU TRAINED WELL THE TRAINING WAS LIKE WAS PORT YOUR INVOLVED WITH HOW MANY TILL IT COUNTS TO SETA BUT IN GENERAL PERSONAL PREFERENCE FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON  THE PR HANDLES NINEY PERSENT OF THE YEM QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT COLD COLD SHOWERS ICE BAS AND COLD IMMERSION UP TO THE NECK I ALWAYS A PREFACIS BY SAYING THERE ARE NOT A A LOT OF STUDIES THERE ARE SOME BUT NOT A LOT OF CONTROLD STUDIES LOOKING AT COLD SHOWERS CAUSE ITS HARDER TO CONTROL THE VARIABLES OF WHERE PEOPLE STAND SO I WOULD SAY IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO COLD IMMERSION OF SOME SORT ICE BATHRICALD IMMERSION GRAY BUT IF YOU DON'T COLD CHOWERS WOULD BE THE NEXT BEST THING THE LORD GOES THAT IF YOU DO AN ICE BATH OR COLD WATER IMMERSION AFTER STRENGTH OR HYPERTNA TRAINING THAT YOU ARE SHORT CIRCUITING SOME OF THAT THE LORE ALSO GOES THAT COLD SHOWERS MIGHT BE O KA AND MY INTERPRETATION OF THOSE DATA AND THAT DISCUSSION IS THAT ALL THAT IS PROBABLY TRUE BUT I HAVE A HARD TIME IMAGINING THAT THE EFFECTS ARE SO ROBUSE THAT IT CAN COMPLETELY PREREVENT STRENGTH GAINS AND MYPERTROPHY SUCH THAT MY STANCS FOR MYSELF IS TRY AND DO THE COLD EXPOSURE TRAINING AWAY FROM THE STRENGTH AND HYPERCOFY TRAINING BUT IF YOU CAN'T DO IT ANY OTHER TIME RIGHT AFTERWARD PROBALISING IN A THROW MY WHOLD SYSTEM ATT A WACK AAND PREVENT THE IMPROVEMENTS N MY DELUDING MYSELF IM COUPLEOF CAVEYOTS SOONER OR ONE I TO SAY HAVE A PERSONAL FESTED INTERESTS AND COLD IV BEEN AROUND THIS SU FOR A LONG TIME IM BEING INVOLVED AND BEING AN ADVISER FOR EXP T AND BEINGIN A SPACE A LONG TIME O'M A BIG BELIEVER IN COLD SPECIAL COLD WATER DELIVERATE COLD EXPOSURE HUNDRED PERCENTRIGHT SO THAT BEING SAID A I DO THANK GETTING IN TO AN ICE BATH IMMEDIATELY AFTER A HYPERTRY SESSION IS GETTING PRETTY CLOSE TO YOU JUST SHOULD A DONE THE SESSION IT IS DETRIMENTAL GOOD TO KNOW I WOULDN'T DO IT I GUESS IS THE MOST BLUNTWY TO PUT IT OM IF YOU ERE LIKE HA I I AM NOT SUPERCONCERN WITH GROWING MUSCLE AND I WANT THESE OTHER THINGS A COME WITH COLD WATERIMERSION FINE IT'S NOT A ZEAR IS NOT ZERO ITS NOT TAKING YOU BACKWARDS HOW MUCH DOES IT CUT YOU DOWN I DON'T KNOW WE DN'T KNOW THAT LIKE TID BE A DIFFICULT NUMBER TO COME UP WITH IS IT ONE PERCENT RODUCTION NOW IT'S MORE THAN THAT IS IT A HUNDRED NOT EVEN CLOSE I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT LAMBS THOUGH IT'S ENOUGH THOUGH FOR ME TO GO IN GENERAL BEST PRACTICES DON'T IN THE ICE I MEAN I AFTER WORK OUT HOW LONG SHOULD I WAIT WELL IN THEORY THE BEST ANCE WE COUN GIVE YOU WOULD BE FOR HOURS BECAUSE OF WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER TO DAY OV OF GOING OLL CAME IMMEDIATELY YOU'VE GOT THE SIGNALLING CASCADE THAT TAKES SECONDS YOU'VE GOT GENE EXPRESSION THAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS ROUGH FOR OUR WINDOW AFTER THE GENES OF GONE OFTEN NOW YOU JUS GOIN TO THE BROACHING SINTHES'S PROCESS THE SIGNALS WORD BE THERE IN IT'S GONE BACK DOWN O BASELINE SO THEN REINTRODUCING AR INTRODUCING COLD HERE IS NOT GOIGTO DISRUP THAT SIGNAL THAT'S A VERY I' NON SCIENTIFICALLY FOUNDED BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT AT ALL WHAT IS VERY CLEAR THOSE IF YOU GET OFF YOUR WORK OUT GO RIGHT NE THE ICE IT'S PROBABLY TEN PER CENT A TENUATION OF GROWTH I DN'T NO MAYBE MORE DEPENDS THE PERSON SOME PEOPLE IF YOU LOOK AT TH INDIVIDUAL DATA IT'S A PRETTY BAD IT'S ENOUGH TO WORDS LIKE THAT THAT'S A REALLY BIG DEAL THE BENEFITS OF THE ICE I DON'T THINK NOW O'T WAY THE BENEFITS OF OF TYPERTRBE TRAINING WHAT ABOUT COLD SHOWERS I DON'T THINK COLD SHOWERIS AREGOING TO DO MUCH I'M IF YOU'VE BEEN IN BOTH YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS LIKE ERE NOT PLYING THE SAME GAME HERE AN ICE BATH OR COLD WAT OR TRUE COLD WATER IMMERSION UP TO THE NECK WITH LIMBS IN IF FOR ONE TO FIVE MINUTES IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STIMULUS THAN IN THE COLD SHORE ESPECIALLY ALSO COMPARED DI SIMILAR LIKE TRIAL IT IS NOT EVEN THE SAME SAME THING HERE I'M SO IN GENERAL I WOULD SAY DON'T DO THOSE COLD SHOWER I DON'T REALY CARE CAN YOU WORK IT OUTSLEE DON'T DO THEM SAME TIME THAT'ULD BE MY HOPE RIGHT I'M I WOLD ACTUALLY PREFOR YOU THE COLD BEFORE I YOU REALLY HAD TO DO IT I'M CERTAINLY WLL WAIT YOU UP YOU ATTLIN BURST NO WE'VE PLAYE WITHOT ACTUALL YEARS AGO I'M DOING THAT I'M THERE'S ACTUALY SOME FUNSTUFF YOU CAN DO WITH THE ENDURANCE PIECE WITH COLD STUFP BUT IT IT'S TOTALLY NOT FEASIBLE FOR MOST PEOPLE COULDR GET AT O GEAGING WATER EVERYWHERE THAT CAN JUMP ON YOUR BY CAN JUST GET SHIT AND ITSIST A GIANT MESS IT'S FOND MET YET I WOULD SAY WALKWAYFREMIT IF YOU CAN' THAT'S ACTUALLY S WHERE I STAND BASED ON THE DATA I'M BASE ON MY INTUITION AND ANEXPERIENCE I DON'T IND'LL HIEK IS A GOOD THING TO DO NOW HAVING SAID THAT THAT'S MOSTLY CONCERNED WITH MAXIMIZING HYPERTROPHY STRENGTH IT'S NOT AS CLEAR THERE ARE SOME DATE TO SHOW IT OUTR BLOCK STRENGTH AT APTATIONS BUT BECAUSE OF WH WE TALKE BUT EARLIER THAN MECHANISMS AND THAT DRIVERS ARE DIFFERENT AND SO I DON'T THINK IT'S AS BIG A CONCERN I'M FORE STRENGTH DEVELOPMENT THOUGH I WOULD STILL GENERALLY SAFE YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH STAYING OUT OF THE ICE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WORK OUT AND YOU CAN LEAST WAIT A FEW HOURS THAT'S THE BETTER APPROACH LESS CONCERNED WITH STRENGTH MORE CONCERN WITH HYPERTROPHY AND TERMS OF INTERFERANCE EFFECT I'M IF YOU CAN DO IT ON OFF DAYS OR BEFORE OR ANY OTHER TIME THAT'S THAT'S THE PLACE TO LAND THAT'S GENERALLY WHEN I TRIED TO DO IT ET'S JUT'S GOT IT THRAWING OUT EXTREME CASE AS I GET AS THAT QUESTION A LOT WHAT ABOUT THE USE OF A ICE BATH OR COLD WATER IMMRSION WE'RE COLD SHOWER AFTER ENDURANCE TRAINING OH GET SO A COUPLE OF INTERESTING THINGS HERE YOU MENTIONED WE DON'T HAVE A TREMENDOUSMON A DATA ON COLD WATER EMERSIENT OVER ALL SO A LOT IS IS MOVING I'M THERE HAVE BEEN SOME PAPERS TO SHOW THAT COLD WATER IMERGE AND CANNACTUAL IN HANDS MONOCONDROBAL GENESIS AND ACTUALLY EVEN FOR ENDURANCE STUFF IT'S BEEN SHOWINTO TO CAUSE IMPROVEMENT ENDURANCE AAPTATIONS RELATIVE TO NOHT IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR ME TO BE TRULY CONFIDENT AND THT' SATEMEN YET I WOULD LIKE TO Y THAT REPEATED NOT NOT THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE PAPER THE METHODOLOGY THAT THIT USE AN OT PTIC OR STUDY BUT IS US S I IS A WEIRD THINGS I WANTO SEE THIS REPEATED MORE OFTEN SO I HAVE LESS CONCERN WITH DOING IN IMMEDIATELY POST IN DURANCE CAUSE YOU COULD EVEN ARGUE THAT THERE MAY BE SOME BENEFIT I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO GOOUTO YOUR WAY TO TRY TO MAKE YOURE EAT AN ICE IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS AND THINKING YOU CAN TO GET SOME MASS OF ADAPTATION I'M WE USE ICE A DECENT AMOUNT WHEN I CAN GET APLET TO DO IT BUT THIS CONTECT IS DIFFERENT NUMBER ONE WHEN WE'RE IN CAMP AND WE'VE GOT A WORLD TITLE FIGHT COMING OUT OR SOMETHING ELSE I'M WE'VE JUST PITCHED IN IT AND A MAJ R BASEBO GAME I AM NOT CONCERN ABOUT IPERTROPHY I AM NOT EVEN CONCERN A STRENGTH O ELTMENI AM NOW PUSHING TORT RECOVERY THERE'S A PARADIME THAT I THINK ITS IMPORTANT WITH ALL THESE THINGS UNDERSTAND WHICH IS ARE YOUR PUSHING FOR OPTIMIZATION RADAPTATION WHEN YOU'RE PUSHING FOR ADAPTATION YOU DON'T WANT A BLOCK THE SIGNAL FOR ADAPTATION THIS MEANS LESS RECOVERY YOUE NOT GOING TO FEEL AS GOOD AND YOU PROBABLY SHOULD BE HEDGING TOWARDS STRESS WHEN YOU'RE PUSHING FOR OPTIMIZATION IT'S THE OPPOSITE SO I' IF I'M IN SEASON AND I HAD A PICTURE JUST THROW A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIPTITTHES I'M NOT TRYING THE CAUSE ADAPTATION I'M TRYING TO RECOVER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE FOUR DAYS FROM NOW WE GOT TO DO THIS AGAIN AND I GOT TO DO THIS ACROSS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO GAMES IM I' YOUE CON A PLAY SIXDAY FIVE DAYS IN A PEGIAC OFF TURNAMEN AND YOU CAN HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN EVERY WEEK FOR A BUNCH WEETS IN AROUG I NEED RECOVERY AS FAST AS I POSSIBLY CANSO FOM BLUNTING ADAPTATION FINE I'M NON ECTRYTINE TO DO SON 'M TRYN OPTIMIZE IF YOU SPEND ALL YOUR TIME IN ONE OF THOSE TWO AREAS YOU'RE GOINGTO HAVE PROBLEMS SO YOU NEED TO BE JUDICIOUS ABOUT THINKING IS THIS A POINT MI LIFE OR TRAINING CYCLE THAT I WANT TO CAUSE ADAPTATIONS OR AM I TRYING TO OPTIMIZE YOU SPEND TOO MUCH TIME IN WON WONE THE OTHER ONES AGAIN YOU CAN HAVE PROBLEM SO THAT'S IN GENERALLY HOW I WILL TREATS I'M THE ICE FOR FOR ALL THOSE ADAPTATIONS WHAT ABUT HEAT YEH WHEN THET N ELFRAME THIS QUESTION DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE I I'M SURE THERE'RE NUMBER OF WAYS IN WHICH HEAT CAN SHORT CIRCUIT ALL SORTS OF THINGS I MEAN HE CAN IN ACCESS CAN KILL YOU YE IT CAN SHUT DOWN FORTILITY IT CAN A IN ACCESS RIGHT IT CAN DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS BUT IT CAN ALSO INCREASE GROWTH ORMON INCREASE IS A VIOLATION IMPROVE ONE'S ABILITY TO SWET WHICH CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL IN A NUMBER OF CONTECTS YETFOR THE TYPICAL FOR SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF PEOPLE SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT AF THE TIME WHEN DO YOU THINK HEAT IS MOST USEFUL AND HERE I'M REFERRING TO DRYS ON OR WETS ON A I'M NOT SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT IN FOR RETS ON O BECAUSE THE DATOF THERE LE AND CLEAR TO ME AND I I DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT MY CENSE WITH HIM FOR ATISAWNUS AS THEY DON'T GO HOT ENOUGH FOR MY PARTICULAR TASTE YOU AND I HAVE A SIMILAR TASTE THERE OGE AR NOT CRUSHING TWO HUNDRED PAST ON I'M NOT INTERESTED RIGHT AND IN MY CENSE O ABOUT IM FOR RETS ON A IS THAT MAYBE HAVEN'T SEEN THE DATA S THAT I' BUT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE IT CAUSE THEY LIKE THE WAY THEY LOOK IN THE AN FORETS ON IT FEEL SCHOOL FEELS LIKE YOURE DOING SOMETHING UNUSUAL NOW IN FOR ED LIFEIRE BENEFICIAL FOR OTHER REASONS I CAN FOR MY TO CONDURAL HEALTH IN THE RATINAS ER IT THE GOOD DA A BUT IM FOR RED SAWNA TO ME THEY NEVER GOES HOT ENOUGH SO I'M TALKING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED OR HOT ER MAYBE A HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO TWENTY OBVIOUSLY DO WHAT SAFE FOLKS AND HEAT ALL THE WARNINGS ABOUT PREGNENT YE PEOPLE NOT GOING SIE ET CETERA I SOON BY YOUR LUMPING IN HOT WATER MERCHANIS  HOT WATER MERSIANA SO HOT BATHS HOT SAN A WHEN WOULD YOU LIKE WHEN YOU THINK MOST PEOPLE COULD LEVERAGE SANA OR HOT BATHS TO BENEFIT THEIR TRAINING AND FITNESS AND AND HEALTH YE OK I HAVE A HANDFUL OF THINGS SAY ABOUT THIS TOPIC ONE OF EM IS YOU NEVER HAVE A HARD TIME CONVINCING PEOPLE TO GET HOT ET RON'T FEELS GOOD LIKE I CAN HOT BTH LITE CAN YOU TAKE MORE HOT SHOWERS SURE I NO PROBLEM THEY'RE RIGHT I' THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF STUDIES THAT OF LOOK AT ITHIS IMMEDITELY POST AND IT SEEMS TO EVEN AUGMENT HYPERTRE SO AFTER HYPERCH OF RO TRAIN IND GETTING IN THE SA ENOUGH FOR TWENTY MINUTES YOHA WHATEVER WHATEVER NEEDS TO BE I WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD TITRATION WHAT'S THE NUMBER MEN ITS WISE WE DO'T HAVE A TEMPERATURE TIGRATION HOT SHOUER WOULD WOULD BE A SECOND THAT WOULD BE A WEEK SECOND BEST I WOULD SAY TO VERY WEEK SAY A HOT BATH I THINK A HOT BATH ITS PROBABLY A LOT CLOSER TO WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IN ACTUAL CON T GOES BACK TO OUR NITIAL CONVERSATIONS THEORETICALLY YOU'RE JUST GOING TO AID AN BLOOD FLOW SEEGING TO PUT MORE NEUTRIANS IN MORE WAYSTE PROTIC OUT METABLE EXTRESS ALL THAT SUFF IS GOING THROUGH SO BTHAT'S THE THOUGHT ANY WAYS WE E FAR FROM MALENTS PLAUSIBLE  ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE I'M SOMETHING PEOPLE WILL DO FEELS GOOD I'M WHY  IT'S A WITH COLD AND HOT I WANT A CAUTION YOU IAGAINST A COUPLE OF THINGS THIS IS TRUE ACROSS ALL PHYSIOLOGY BUT YOU NEED TO BE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT MOVING PERCENTAGES FROM MOLECULAR TO OUTCOME VERY CAREFUL SO FOR EXAMPLE IT'S EASY TO SEE A PAPER IM THAT SAYS IO' KINE WE PUT YOU IN HOT BATH OR SOMETHING AND WE SAW GROWTH HORMONE INCREASED THREE UNDRED PERCENT THAT IS NOT GOING TO RESULT AN THREE UNDRED PERSCENT INCREASE AND MUSCLE SIZE RIGHT IN FACT THREEHUNDRE PER CENT MI RESULTS IN ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE IN PHYSICAL SIZE RIGHT SO AND REASON OF SAYING THIS IS BECAUS EIT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE SPACE THAT WILL MISSAPPLY THE MECHANISMS AND THE THO GROSSLY OVER ESTIMATE WHAT THESE THINGS CAN DO IN WHAT THEY DO DO BECAUSE THEY'LL FIND SOMETHING LIKE THAT I'M IMYOU KNOW THIS YOU'VE DONE NO SELL YOUR WORK TO IN THE LAB IF I SEE AM TOWAR DOUBLED IM I THINK SHEDITAN WORK I NEEN TO SEE TENNAXS INCREASE BEFORE I NOWICE EVEN PHYSIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT SO READING THAT PAPER READING SOME ON SOCIAR MEUPLESIER LIKE WHA IT INCREASE AM TOERE THIRTYEIGHT PER CENT I'M LIKE MIDIN'T WORK NYOU'RE LIKE WHAT T TUGE THAT'S NOT THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT INCREASE IN ALSO SIZE STAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT POINT WHEN I MAKE BECAUSE I'MEN A TALK ABOUT THE BENEFITS HERE A SECOND BUT I'M II DO WH I DON WHAT PEOPLE BE FOOLED AN TO THINKING THAT THIS IS SOME CRAZY MIRACLE I'M THE SAME THING WITH THE SON IM IN TERMS OF GENERAL HEALTH HEALTHOUT COMES IT IS A CLEARLY A BENEFICIAL THING THIS IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA TO GET HOT A LOT IT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR EXERCISE TO IT'S A VERY IMPORTANTCI T ANCIENT IF THE AUNT IF THE OPTIONS ARE NOTHING OR SANA GET IN THE SAN REALLY REALLY GOOD IDEA IF TO THE EXCHANGEIS THOUGH I DO'T NED TO WORK OUT BECAUSE I DID THE SANA BAD YTHIS IS NOT A WINNING SOLUCIAN YOU AND I SON'T KNO SOM MANIACTS THAT ACTUALLY WORK OUT IN THE SAN I WE DO YA NO I DON'T NECESSARY RECOMMEND THAT THAT ACTUALLY U WOULD PROBLY KILL A A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BUT OU CANRTHI D CAN BE WORKED UP TO YE IT CERTAINLY YET SO I WH LIKE EVERY TIME I TALK ABOUT THAT I I FLAG THAT BECAUSE IT'S JUST TOO EASY HE THA'T GO OH I THINK DOCTOR YOU WERE IN SAID IF I JUST GETT THE SAN I I'M HAVE TO WORK OUT NO THE'S WORSH OF NEVER DEVI IS NI THAT AND I DEFULLY NOT WORKING OUT IN THE SANA IF I'M IN THE SAN ON EITHER SITTING OR I'M LYING DOWN AND I'M TRYING TO MAKE IT THROUGH I TEND TO DO THREE TWENTY MINUTE BOUTS YE A CROSS THE ENTIRE WEEK SO I AIM FOR SIXTY MINUTES PER WEEK YET OF HEAT EXPOSURE I WOULD BE JUONNTON IF I SAID I'VE NEVER WORKED OUT THE SNA US YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE YV HE WILL DO EIR SQUATS THE'LL BRING THE AIR DI'M BIKE IN THERE I'M I LOOK AT TE SAN AS KIND OF A TIME TO GET LAZY IN THISWEAT TOTALLY FIND I'M GOING BACK TO O QUESTION SO POTENTRAL AIGHT PLOSSIBLE A WE NE JUS SEE MORE RECS FOR DRAWN THAT TO REALLY GET IN DON'T I TO PUT THE SOME PRACTICE I THINK IF YOU TRY IT VERY LITTLE HARM II G STROGGLE TO SE IT DOWNSIDE IF YOU MAKES YOUR HYDRATIONS ON QUOIT RIGHT NOW YOU GOT A FACTOR IN THE FACT YOU JUST KICKED OUT TO RE THREE POUNDS IF YOUARE YOU AT TWO IN ER PLUS POUNDS I SOON OR ROUGHLY I F YOU'E IN THE SON FOR TWENTY MINUTES I WOULD IMAGINE YOU CN DO TWO THREE POUNDS YI USUALLY IM I'M HOVER SOMEWHERE ROUND TI TWO TWENTY FIVE YE I DRINK IM I DRINK A THIRTY TWO OUNCE RIGHT VE S WATER WITH THE ELECTROLIKE SOLUTION THAT'S PRETTY HIGH SAULT AFTERWARDS AND SOMETIMES DURING AND SOMETIMES AFTER THAT IF I DO IT LATE IN THE EVENING I'LL GO TO SLEEP AND WAKEM IN THE MILL NIGHT WET JUST FEELING SO PARCHED IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH WILL ONE LOSES IN THE SANA IKE A NORMAL SWEAT RATE FOR SOMEMON TWO TWENTY FIVE ESPECIALLY AND TWENTY MINUTES ON A SANA I WOULD ABSOLUTELY EXPECT YOU TO DO THREE POUNDS EASY WITHOUT I SHOULD BE DREATHING MORE PROBAB EVEN MORE WATER YET YOU'RE PROBABLY HALF THE WATER THAT YOU NED TO GET AND YOU MENTION THE THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS OF DOING IT AFTER STRAINGTH HYPERTRAPHY TRAINING WHICH ARE MAKE SENSE FOR PLAUSIBLE MECINIS YEC REASONS AND NOT NO OFFICIAL DAT O THEIR YET WHAT ABOUT AFTER ENDURANCE TRAINING ASSUMING SOMEBODY HYDRATES WELL ENOUGH AND THE'R NOT OVER HEATED FROM THEIR ENDURANCE WORK YE COULD ALSO BE A BENEFIYE IL SO MORE AND MORE WOULD I'M THINKING THE FRAMEWORK HERE IS IN AN IDEAL WORLD ONE WOULD TRAIN AND THEN DO SANA Y OR HEAT EXPOSURE OF SOME KIND IN DURANT TRAINING WORE STRNGTH HYPERTRARY TRAININ ANDTHEY U SANA AND THEN DO COLD EXPOSURE ON OFF DAYS ARE AT LEAST FOUR HOURS AWAY FROM THE FROM ANY KIND OF TRAINING OR IF YOU HAD TO DO IT CLOSE TO TRAIN DOING T BEFORE TRAIN YE I LOVE THE COLD THE MORNING WA WE VACT YURE ON THIS EXPERIMENT ON PROFESSIONAL OT THING TILL WE DO' NOT TRACKING WITH THINGS LIKE GATE OUR PEA WHICH IS A GLOBLE METRIC OF IOVER ALL FATIGUE OKE AND YU'VE YOUR PROVY TALKED ABOUT THAT BEFORE A BIT PROBLEMS WITH IT BIT ROUGHLY IDEA WROBSE  AHTR  BE IN GENERAL HIGHER THE SCORE THE BETTER RIH SO  LOW ATROF ES FATIGUE I WELL IF YOU WAKE UP AND TAKE YOUR AHTROF E IN THE MORNING AND HN YOU GET INTO ICE WHAT'S GONG AO HAPEN IS YOU AN SEE THAT NUMBER PLUM ET THE SECOND YOU GET OUT THAT'S GOING TO FALL OFF THE EARTH WICH MEANS ROUGHLY YOU'VE MOVED INTO A SYMPATHETIC A SPLACE SURPRISING YOU GET IN THIRTY DEGREE WATER YOU GRN TO GO VERY SYMPATHETIC VERY QUICKLY HOWEVER IF YOU CONTINUE TO WATCH FOR AHTRE OF E FOR THIRTY SIXTEEN NINETY AND UP TO TWO TO THREE HOURS POST YOU WILL GENERALLY SEE A IN IMPROVED EIGHT ORE OF YOU SCORE RELATIVE TO WHERE YOU STARTED SO IT'S IT'S BACK TO THIS HORMATIC STRESS ARE RIGHT A REALLY COLD SHOCKING EXPOSURE WE'LL BE A NET RESULT OF YOU BEING MORE RELAXED THROUGHOUT THE DAY IN GENRA AND WE'VE SEEN THAT NOW A VERY CONSISTENTLY Y CROSS YEARS WITH WHAT AMPLYS  I SO I THINK IT'S A GREAT WEIGH TO STRARTURE DAY  YOU WON'T NEED NEARLY AS MUCH COFFEE AFTER SPENDING THREE MINUTES AND THIRTY DEGREE WATER THER  DEGREES IS PRETTY  PREDON N COLD I WAS IN THE OCEAN THIS MORNING FOR ABOUT THREE MINUTES THE DELL LIDN BRING A THERMOMETER BUT IT FELL LIKE SOMEWHERE IN THE LOW FIFTIES BUT FIFTYN MOVING AS REALLY COLD YELL WATER'S MOVING YE I THAT'S REALLY COL THAT'S RIGHT THE THERMA LAYR THAT AT THAT A SURROUNDS YOU WHEN YU SIT STILL IN A COLD WATER IMMERSION I'M INCURGING PEOPLE NOW IF THEY REALLY  I WAS THE JOKE THAT YOU PEOPLE LIKE TO LOOK REAL STOIC AND TOUGH WHEN THEY'RE IN THERE LIKE THEYRE JUST GRINDING THROUGH WITH NO PAIN IT ALL BUT THAT THE STILLNESS IS ACTUALLY OF REDUCING THE YE THA STIMULUS IF THEY SIFT AROUND A LITTLE BUT YOU BREAK UP THAT THERMMA LAIR THAT'S WHERE THE REAL ACTION WE WEAVE JOKED ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS DO FIFTY DEGREES WITH THE WORLPOOL JET ON NOW 'M IN PRESSED TAT THAT IS HORD YOU SIT IN THIRTY FIVE DEGREE FOR THREE A MINUTES IGEST BUT WITH EXPETO I'VE SEEN I CAN'T EVE TELL YOU HOW MANY HNDREDS OF PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS A LIFE ON ALL AGE THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET IN THIRTY SOME DEGREE WATER FOR THREE MINUTES FIFTY DEGREES WITH A WORLBILL GOING THAT NUMBER GETS VERY SMALL YET IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A WHIRLPOOL THIS IS THIS SHOULD BE REASSURING TO YOU CAN SOME PEOPLE SAY YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ICE AND ICE CANNOT SHU GET PRETTY EXPENSE OF YOU'RE DOING A FIFTY DOLLAR I SA A EVERYDAY SO YOU CAN FILL YOUR BATHS UP WITH M COOL TO COLD WATER GET IN BUT JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU KEEP SIFTING YOUR LIMBS AND IT IT'S CHILLY YE  AND THIS THE STUDIES ON THE VERY WELL ASTEP NOW WELL ESTABLISH INCREASES AND DOPEMIN AN EPAN EFFERON THAT A CUR IN COLD WATER SPORSURE RATHLY DONE AT AN HOUR IN SIXTY DEGREES FAIR N YE AND SO IT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED AT ICE COLD OR AN ICE BATH BUT IMMERSION IS REALLY BETTER THAN THE COLD SHOWER THE COLD SHOWER IS KIND OF A IT'S THE UM IT'S IT'S KIND OF THE EXPRESSOR SHOT THE AVERSION NYET NO THAT'S THA ITS SORT OF FUNNYC AUSE IF YOU LOOK OUT MOST OF THOSE ANATURAL STUDIES AND YOU THINK MAN HOW DID THEY GET PEOPLE TO SIGN UP TO SPEND FORTY FIVE MINUTES IN FIFTY FIVE DEGREE WATER FIFTY FIVE DEGREES IS COLD OUN IF I'S NOT MOVING AN O GAN AN NOT SPEND FIVE MINUTES ANT A BEGGON HOUR IF YOU'VE EVER DON ICE BASTS AT THAT TEMPERTARE YOU KNOW I AREN'T AFTER A FEW MINUTES IT'S NOT THAT BAD BUT MAN THT'S A PROTOCOL TYET'S IT ISIT IT'S KIND OF AN ENA COLD ENDURANCE PROTOCOLIC IT'S ONE THING TO GET IN FOR ONE MINUTE TO THREE MINUTES A YOU KNOW YOU'R GETTING OUT YOU COULD SING A SONG YOU CAN DO ANYTHING TO DISTRACT YOURSELF BUT FORTY FIVE MINUTES TO AN HOUR IS IS INTENSE AMAYBE TH I DON'T I DON'T THINK THEY PAID THE SUBJECTS BUT ANYWAY THAT THE THAT STUDY WAS YON THING OF EUROPES I FORGET WHERE IT WAS DONE BUT AM ANYWAY THEY THE WERE HARDY SUBJECTS WONT T TALK A BIT ABOUT OVER TRAINING ENGAGING RECOVERY YET A SO THER COUPLE METHODS THAT AM I'VE HEARD ABOUT AND THAT I USE AM BASED ON SOME DATA THAT I'VE SEEN BUT MAINLY DISCUSSIONS WITH REALLY INFORME PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF PRIME MACKENZY A KELLY STARR AT AN OTHERS THE TO THAT I'M AWARE OF FOR GAGING RECOVERY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND KIND OF SYSTEMIC RECOVERY OR AM GRIP STRENGTH ESPECIALLY O GRIPSTRENGTH ON WAKING IN THE MORNING YAND A THE SO CALLED CORMODAC I TOLERANCE TAS THE ABILITY TO DO A LONG CONTROLLED EXILE AFTER A FEW A RHYTHMIC DEEP BREATHS JUST T WHICH I MASSUMING TAPS INTO BOTH A MAT ONE'S ABILITY TO MECHANICALLY N CONTROL THE DIAFRIM BUT ALSO HOW WELL ONE IS REGULATING CARMODAXIDE FIRST QUESTION IS IS THIS STUFF AM FICTION FACT OR AM A COMMONATION OF KIND OF ANECDATA AS I CALL IT ARE THERE ANY PURE REFU PUBLISHED ATA IS YOUR LAD WORKING ON THESE THINGS AND AM AM I DELUDING MYSELF USING THESE TOOLS OR ER THEY USEFUL IT'S NOT FICTION AT ALL THERE ARE I'M WUT WUT LIKE SEEL TWO TOLERANCE S LESS PUBLISHED DATA WE'VE RUN A  STUDY ING OUR LAD LOOKING AT THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE SU TO TOLERANCE AND WELL BE CALLS TRAIT AND STATE ANXIETY I AN NOS ARE IN THE PUBLICATION PROCESS IS WHAT I'LL SAY IDRAT SO YOU CAN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT THAT STOFFASH YOU KNOW AND AN TELL IT TOUT BUT IN GENERAL ID SAY LIKE AS REASON I'M STILL TOING IT A'LL DES RIT A'LL JUST LEAVE YET WASSUMING ITS NOT A CLINICAL TRY MAN I THINK SHARING AM PRELIMINARY FINDINGS FINE SONS WE HIGH LIKE THEM AS PRELIMINARY YET I'M NOT A REVIEWER BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO READING THE PAPER YABIT AS YOU NO SCIENTIFIC AT THIC LIK LIKE YOU NEE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT SAYING TELLMING PEOPLE RESULTS BEFORE YOU'VE COME THROUGH THAT PRO LIFE WHICH IS WHY I'M FLAGING THIS I O THESE RESULTS ARE NOT YET PURE PASS THROUGH THE PURE REVIEW PROCESS SO YOUR HEARING ABOUT IT PRIOR TO PURE REVIEW YET HAVING SAID THAT TIM THERE'S ENOUGH IN THAT FEEL THAM NOT THE FIRST ONE INTO THAT FIELD AND SO I I 'M VERY CONFIDENT THAT THAT'S THAT'S A REAL THING I'M IN TERMS OF ACTUAL TRACKING RECOVERY THE BIG PICTURE IS THIS WHEN WE RUN THROUGH A FULL ANALYSIS WHEN WE WHEN WE HAVE AN OUT THET GO THROUGH A BOM A BONMA LIKELARATHIC PROGRAM WERE IN A RUN AND WERIL GOT THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES CAN COUNTEGRY ONE A W CALLED VISIBLE STRESSERS ANDTHEN WE HAVE HIDDEN STRASCERS AND THE WE HAVE RECOVERY CAPACITY ANY TIME THE TOTAL STRASS LOAD OUT PACES RECOVERY CAPACITY YOU REATHER GOING BACKWARDS IN YOUR PHYSICAL ABILITY OR YOUR REDUCING ADAPTABILITY NOW YOU HAVE LOVERS TO PULL HERE YOU CAN REDUCE STRESS INTAKE OR YOU CAN INCREASE RECOVERY CAPACITY RIGHT WHAT WE WANT IN AN IDEAL SITUATION IS TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE MOST STRESS POSSIBLE CAUSE THAT'S THE DRIVER OF ADAPTATION RECOVER FROM THAT NOW WE GET THE MOST ADAPTATION AND APTATION BEING SIMPLY A CHANGE WHATEVER CHANGE YOU WANT TO BE THAT'S THAT'S OUR GOLD STANDARD RIGHTS PINE LHY ACT SOME PEOPLE HAVE INDOGENOUS DIFFERENCES THEY JUS RECOVER BETTER THEY DON'T THEYRE GENETIC FACTORS BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ONESTHAT ARE MANIPULATABLE IF WE GO TO THE STRESS SIDE OF IT YOU WANT THE THRATTLE TO BE PUSHED AS FAR DOWN ON THE ONES YOU WANT STRESS FROM AND AS FAR OFF OF TE ONES YOU DON'T WANSTRESS SO THAT THE ADAPTATION COMES IN THE EXACT EREA YOU WANT AN YO'RE NOT BURNING GAS AND SOMETHING YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST YOU'RE YOU'RE TAKING THAT TOTAL STRESS BUCKET TOO HIGH I'M RECOVERY CAPACITY OVER THERE SO HERE'S HOW YOU CAN DO THAT YOU CAN RUN SOME ANALYTICS AND MEASURE WHAT WE DO WITH EVERY ONE TO THESE THESE VERY COMPREHENSIVE BREAK DOWNS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THAT PHYSIOLOGY LOOK LIKE HIDDEN AND VISIBLE AND THEN WHAT'S THE RECOVERY CAPACITY ONCE WE HAVE THAT BLUE PRINT WE CAN NOW FIGURE OUT WHAT OF THE TWO OR THREE THINGS WE NEED A TRACK THAT ARE THESE INDICATORS OF WHAT WE CALL PERFORMANCE ANCHORS SO AN ANCHOR IS SOMETHING THAT KIND OF DRAGS BEHIND YOU ORE BELOW YOU THAT SLOWS YOU DOWN THE ANALOGY BEING LET'S SEE WEARE GOING DOWN ONE OF THESE AMAZING CANYON ROADS AND WON'T SAY WHICH CANYON WEREIN SO YOU CAN STAY HIDDEN HERE IM AN YOURE CARS GOING DOWN INTO CERTAIN VELOCITY AND YOU WANT TO GO FASTER MOST PEOPLE'S US FIRST IMPULSE IS TO HIT THE GAS THE ACCELERATOR WE WANT TA PUSH WELL THAT'S FINE BUT IF YOU'RE FOOT IS ON THE BRAK AND YOU PUSH THE ACCELERATOR YOU MIGHT GO ITL A BIT FASTER BUT NEMBER ONE YOU'RE WASTING A LOTO LITERAL GAS TO GO LOBI FASTER AND TOO YOU'RE BURNING YOUR ENGINE YOU MIGT YOU'RE GONG TO BLOW THE EASIER SOLUTION IS JUST TAKE YOUR FOOT OFF THE BRAK YOU'RE GOING TO GO FASTER BY JUST STOPPING YOURSELF THEN IF THAT'S NOT FAST ENOUGH WE CAN HIT THE ACCELERATOR EVERYONE LAST TO JUST PUSHD DOWN RIGHT MORE STIMULUTS MORE OPTIMIZATION BING MING MINGMING M HERE OUR FIRST ANALETICS ARE WHEREARE THSE PERFORMANCE ANCHORS WHAT'S DRAGGING YOU BACK WHAT'S HAND WHAT'S PUTTING DOWN THE BRAK I WON TO MOVE THOSE TWO OR THREE THINGS OUT OFTHE WAY AND I'LLET SEE HOW FAR YOU GET OH LOOK AT THAT YOURE RECOVERY CAPACITY HAS GONE AWAY UP YOU'RE DAPT YOU'RE ADAPTATIONS ORE HAPPENING FASTER NOW OR WE CAN DO MORE WORK BECAUSE YOURE RECOVERING QUICKER SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IN THOSE BUCKETS AND WE HAVE A WHOLE HOST TOF THINGS WE MEASURE BILE MARKERS AND SURVEYS AND EVERYTHING ELSE WE GO THROUGH TO FIND OUT WHAT'S THERE SO AFTER WE'VE ONE THAT NOW WE'R JUST GOING TO TRACK A FEW OF THESE RECOVERY MARKERS ALONG THE WAY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GLOBILY HAPPENING SO THAT COULD MEAN GRIP STRANGT I'M I HAVE SOME FOLKS WHO WE'R IN A TESCRIPTS RINGT DAILY ALL THERS WE'RE GON TO LOOK AT AH ARBY OR COMBINATIONS WE MAY LOOK AT PERFORMANCE MECTRICS LIKE A A FORCE PLAHT SOING INTO A VERTICAL JUMP EVERY SINGLE DAY I WERE TO SEE WETETHAT'S AT WE'VE USE THE TAPTESTS BEFORE WHICH IS HOW MANY TIMES YOU CAN TAP YOUR FINGER AS FAST AS POSSIBLE IT'S A ROUGH INDICATOR OF SENCH A NERVOUS SYSTEM IT IT US TEY ONE MITITTOR EXACTLY AND THIS IS APS YOU CAN DO ON THIS LIKE TAPIS FINGERS FAST YOU CAN IT'S CAN SAY YOU'D ID SIXTY TAPS TO DAY AND YOUR YOU'R AVERAGE IS SEVENTY FIVE I LIKE THAT CAUSE IT TAPS IN TO A NOPOT INTENDED AM INTO UPPER MOTORNOR ON CAPACITY IIS A LOT OF THINGS LIKE LIKE GRIP STRANGTH OBVIOUS TO HAVE TO SEND THE DELIBERATE SIGNAL TO MY HEAD TO GRIP BUT AT SOME POINT THE LOWER MOTOR ON SEREGOINGTO BE TAKING OVER THE MAJORITY THE WORK LIKE THE SIGNAL IS PROBABLY ONE AND DONE WHEREAS I AM TAPPING IS GOING TO BE A REPETTED OF SET YO AM SENDING OF SIGNALS FROM UPPER MOTOR NERONS YET SO SOMEMONY ATHLETS I WORK WITH WE TRACK BLOOD EVERY DAY WE TRACK YORINE EVERY DAY WE TRACK AM IDEALLY ACCOMMINATION OF SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE METTERS EVERYTHING FROM HOW DID YOU FEEL LAST NIGHT TO ENVIRONMENTAL CENSORS OF THEIR BEDROOM A FULL PASTEES GOING ON RUNNING LIKE ACTUAL SLEEP DIKE NOSICS NOT OR RING NOTHING AGENS OR BUT LKE FULL ANALEC AN SOME EMINTS IS SIMPLE AS HOW YOU FEELED TO DAY AND MOS HA BRITCAL DUMP IHT SO WE'RE GOING TO PUT PEOPLE IN A POSITION TO SUCCEED ERR TO FIGERE OUT WHAT'S THE LEVER THAT THEY NED TO PULL AS WELL AS WHAT'S THEIR APTITUDE WHAT SPORT OFTHEY AND WHAT WE REALISTICALLY GET AWAY WITH AND SOME OF EM WILL TAKE MACHINES WITH THEM AND WILL DO BLOOD EVERY DAY AND YURN AND ALL KINDS OF STUFFIN SOME OF EM IT'S ATA LOT LOWER FOR MYSELF I I'M NOT PLEASANT MENTIONI FOR I'M NOT A BIFAN OF DEVICES A N WHERE THE WIS RIS WATCH I TEND TO GO OFF FEEL WHICH IS NOT A IT'S NOT THE IDEAL OBJECTIVE WAY TO GAGE THINGS BUT AM PART OF MY REASONING FOR THIS IS MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE PSYCOLOGY DEPARTMENT A A DOCTOR A LEA CRUM AT'S DONE SOME STUDIES WHERE THEY'VE AM GIVEN PEP DELIBERATELY GIVEN PEOPLE FALSE FEED BACK ABOUT THEIR SLEEP SO TOLD PEOPLE YOU DIDN'T SLEEP VERY WELL OR THEY'VE TOLD PEOPLEL YOU SLEPT REALLY WELL AND PERFORMANCE CAN BE DRIVEN IN THE EXPECTED DIRECTION BASED ON FEET BACK INDEPENDENT OF HOW WELL PEOPLE SLEPT ORED IN SLEEP NOW THAT DOESN'T MANYONG TO TAKE SOME ONE THAT ONLY SLEPT TWO HOURS OR WAS NOT OF EVERY TO A THIRTY SECONDS CAUSE OF APNEY AND TELL THEM THEY SLEPT GREAT AND THE'REGINGTO PERFORM GREAT COGNIVE TASKS BUT YOU CAN TAKE SOMEON WHO SLEPT VERY WELL TELL THEM THAT THE RECOVERY QUOTION WASNAT VERY GOOD AND THEIR THEIR OUTPUT IS GOING TO BE WORSE THAT'S MY CONCERN ABOUT A LOT OF DEVICES OUT THERE NOT TO NAME SPECIFIC DEVICES BUT IT'S STILL UNCLEAR TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHAT THE SPECIFIC ALGARYTHMS ARE TO GENERATE THESE RECOVERY SCORES RIGHT AND SO MANY OF THE THNGS THAT REPORTEDLY AM TRACK SLEEP ORN'T TRACKING SLEEP NOT A TRACTING HEART RATE AND BREATHING WHICH ARE CORLETS OF SLEEP DAP BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT AND AGAIN I'M NOT NOCKIN THOSE I I THINK THE SLEEP TRACKERS IF NOTHING ELSE HAVE PROVIDED A FORM WHEREBY PEOPLE ARE VERY CONSCIOUS OF GETTING GOOD SLEEP IT'S WERE LIKE KNOWING THE TOTAL CLORK AN TAKE UP YOUR FOOD YOULL GO WHOW I'M ASHALY EATING A LOT MORE THAN I THOUGHT COBRATI OR LASSIN SOME CASES BUT OFTEN  THE CASES THAT 'S MORE SO I THINK FOR THE TYPICAL PERSE AND I'M WONDERING WHETHER NO LIKE MYSELF A BECAUSE I'M NOT A A A COMPETIVE ATHLEADER SONLY NOT A PROFESSIONAL ATHLEEP AM BETED WITH MYSELF I SUPPOSE BUT NO ONE ELSE MORNING PULSERATE I TEND TO TAKE WHEN A AN WAKING M IF I WAKE OUT OF A REALLY STRESTSFUL DREAM I MIGHT RELAX A LOBITMEN JUST TAKE MY PUL STRATE CON TO GET A RANGE AND SEE IF ITS SPIKING FOR WHATEVER REASON I DON'T RTEND TO MEASURE GRIP STRENGTH ALTHOUGH I'E HEARD YOU CAN JISUSE A CLASSIC A SCALE YEM OLD FASHION SCALE WITH THE CERNEEL NOW OLD FASHION AM OR SOME OTHER MORE TECHNICAL DEVICEIS PROBABLY A GOD A THERE'S A LOW COST ONE THE OTHER  AND THEN THE CARBONDOXI TOLERANCE YES SO WE HAVE N'N EALLY TALKED ABOUT THAT IN  IN SPECIFIC WAYS MY UNDERSTANDING F IT IS ITS AFOR DEEP SLOW BREATHS AND THREW THE NOSE OUT THROUGH THE NOSE AND THEN A BIG IN HAL AS MAXAXALE AND THEN TIME DURATION OF EXHALE THROUGH THE NOSE AND THEN STOPPING THE STOP WATCH AT THE POINT WHERE LONGAS ARE EMPTY NOT NECESSARILY AS LONG AS ONE COULD HOLD THEI BREATH DID I GET THAT RIGHTER YOU MO OKAN I GUESS WE SHOULD CREDIT YOU AND BRINE MACKENZIE A THOSE GAS YEAND  AND THE FOLKS A UNDER A BRIN'S UMBRELLA FOR A REALLY ESTABLISHING THIS AS A REALLY GOOD METRIC WHEN AND HOW CAN I USE THE CARBONOX I TOLERANCE TEST TO GAGE RE COVERI UPON WAKING AM POST TRAINING SESSION YET WITHOT VE GOO TINE A NOMERAL ONE ANSWER IS WHATEVER YOU DO TO BE CONSISTENT SO DO IT UNDER LIKE ANY GOOD SIGNS EXPERIMENT DO IT UNER THEXACTSIME CONDITIONS AND YOU CAN'T THAT GENERALLY MEANS SOMEWHERE IN THE MORNING S THAT'SWHE YO'RE PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE THE MOST CONTROLMOSTABILITY I'M GOING SO YA LIKE YOU WOULD TAKE ANY HORV OR OTHER METRIC WAKE UP GET IN A CONTROL GET STABLIZE TAKE O MATRIC GOT IT CAN BE PRETT GOOD GOT IT SO DY EM BY CARD TETING SODA AM RUMOR HAS IT AND DATA HAS IT THAT IT CAN A SHOULD BE A PRETTY EFFECTIVE TRAINING TOOL VERY EFFECT COULD YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT OF ABOUT HOW IT WORKS AND HOW ONE MIGHT EXPLORE USING SODIAN BY CARB TO ANHANCE TRAINING OUT PUT IN A COUPLE OF DERIN CONTACT YE SO THERE'S A HANDFUL OF THESE YOUVIQUIROUSLY EFFECT IF SUPPLEMENTS FOR PERFORMANCE SO DIN BY CARBONATES ONE OF THEM IT'S A VERY IN GENIUS IDEA CAUSE IT'S SO SIMPLE EFFECTIVELY MOSTOF CONTRACTION HAPPENS BECAUSE INSIMATIC FUNCTION OCCURS WITHIN A FAIRLY SPECIFIC P  TRENCH RIGHT SO IF HOEU GETS EXTREMELY A CITIC IT DOESN'T LIKE IT AND SO WHETHER YOU'RE RUNNING THROUGH A ROBIC LIKE CALISIS R ANAROBECK OR ANYTHING ELSE ALL THESE THINGS REQUIRE EVEN EIGH T P HYDRALISIS REQUIRES AI T P S AND ANDSIM HASTI AT ANSIMS DON'T FUNCTION WELL OUTSIDE HIS FAIRLY SPECIAL RANGE SO WHAT HAPPENS IS GENERALLY FATIGUE THIS THE SENSATIONS OF FATIGUE ARE ACTUALLY CAUSE BY SOME SIGNAL THAT HE WERE STRYING TO RUN ON A P H RE GETTING IN THE WRONG ARRANGE YOU'RE NOT OUT OF GAS USUALLY YOU NOT TOO LOW ON OXION YOU'RE NOT RUNNING LOW AN MUSCLIK LIKE CAGINIAT YOU'R TYPICALL GAN SE SIGN OR FEEL SIGNALS OF FATIGUE WAY PRIOR TO THAT MOSTLY BEING P TES THAT BEING SAID WHAT IF WE COULD REGULATE PGHE BETTER ENTER BY CARBONA RIGHT SO A WITHOUT GOING TOO FAR IN A MATABOLISM EFFECTIVELY WHAT HAPPENS IS IS YOU TAKE N INHAL AND YOU'RE MOSTLY BREATHING IN OXYGEN OWE TO WHEN YOU EXTALE YOUR BREATHING OUT SEE O TO SO THEY DIFFERENCE S YOU'VE GAINED TO CARBON SOMEHOW WELL ALL OF YOUR CARBOHYDRATES IN YOUR BODY COME IN THE FORM OF LONG CARBON CHAINS IN FACT THAT'SWHAT A CARBO HYDRATE MEANS IT IS A ONE CARBON MOLECULE THAT HAS ONE WATER MOLECULE TTACH ITS TO CARBON THAT AS BEEN HYDRATED IN THE CASE OF BIKE GLUCOS BLOOD SUGAR IT'S A SIX CARBON MOLECULE RIT IN TERMS OF FAT WHICH ARETHE ONLY TWO PLACES YOU CAN GET MOST OF YOUR SELLIAN ENERGY CARBOYDRATES IN FAT THAT IS ALSO A BIG LONG BLOCK IN CHAIN OF CARBONS SO WHETHER YOU GETTINGYOUR ENERGY FROM FAT OR CARBO HYDRATE YOU'RE GOING TO SPLIT THOSE ATAMS SO NO THE WORDS YOU'VE GOT SIX CARONS ATTACH TR EACH OTHER AND IN THIS PART O CHEMISTRY TES EXTRAGONIC SO WHEN YOU BREAK THAT CARBON BOND SO BREAK ONE OF THOSE CARBONS OFF FROM THE OTHER THAT'S GOING TO RELEASE ENERGY JUST LIKE IF YOU HAD A PENCIL AND HERE AND I SNAPPED IT OU GO BANG AND POP I BROKE THE BOND THAT WERE CONNECTING THAT GRAPHITE THE NEXT PIECE OF GRAPHIHT AND THAT RELEASED ENERGY AS I PUT ENERGY IN A SYSTEM ET CETERA OOK I AS A RESULT THOUGH WE'VE NOW HAD YOU KNOW SAY FIVE OR SI CARBONS CHAIN TOGETHER WE BROKE ONE OFF THE END WHICH ITS NOT HOW WORKS BUT MAKING THE POINT AND NOW YOU HAVE ONE FREE FLOATING CARBON USE THAT ENERGY RELEASE DO THEY GO MAKE EIGT P THEN GO MAKE YOUR MUSCLES CONTRACT BUT NOW YOU'VE GOT CARBON FLOATING AROUND YOU CAN ASSOCIATE FREEFLOATING CARBON WITH BEING AT A HYEROCITI LEVEL IT'S NOT CHAN HAPPEN THE ONLY WAY THEY GING TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS AS IF YOUR BODY SAYS DO WE HAVE AN OXYGEN MOLECLE AVAILABLE THT WE CAN BINE THIS TO IMMEDIATELY YES WE DO THAT CARBON ATTACHUS TO THAT OXION MOLECULE YOU CAN'T JUST PUT SEAL TO IN THE BLOOD BECAUSE OF WHAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT SE OU OT BIND IT THROGH THIS BY CARBON AT PROCESS IT'S ON TO GO THROUGH YOUR BLOOD IS GOINO GOING TO LONGS IT' AN T GO BACK INTO ITS CARBON OX AND MOLECULES CAN A TRANCS GO THROUGH THE ALVIO I INO THE LONGS AND YOU GOT EXILE SO YOU WENT FROM CARBON THIS BY CARBONIT SYSTEM BACK INTO CARBON EXALE SO INHALED O TWO PLANTS GO THE OPPOSITE BY THE WAY SO THERECANT BREATHE IN THE SEAL TWO THERERE CLEAVE OFF THAT CARBON STACK GOST CARBONS TOGETHER AND THAT'S HOW THEY GET LARGER IM IN YOU'R IN YOUR BLOOD THOSE SIX CARBON CHAINS ARE CALLED GLUCOS IF WE STORE THAT IN OUR MUSCLE WE CALL IT GLIKEAGENS WE TAKE A BUNCH OF LUCOS AND STACK IT TOGETHER AND A PLANT WE CALL THAT STARCH THAT'S EFFECTALLY WHAT IT IS RIGHT'S E YOU TAKE A BUNCH OF CARBON FROM T E ATMOSPHERE STUCK ITALL TOGETHER AND THAT'S A STARCH I'M IF YOU WANT TO DO IN THE FORM OF FRUIT WE TAKE THAT STARCH LIKE FROM THE GROUND YOU PUT IT UP THROUGH A THE TREE GO ALL WAY UP TO THE TOP PUT IT INTO THE FLOWR BREAK IT UP INTO THESE BIG HUGE TRUNKS OF STARCH IN TO LITTLE FORMS CALLED FRUTOS OR GLUCOS THAT'S WHY FRUIT HAS FRUTOS IN IT AND THAT'S WHY TUBERS AND STOF HAVE STARCHION BASELY STARCH IN AN ANIMAL IS LIKE ADERNUS OOK IT ALL THAT TO SAY IF THAT'S HAPPENG AND WE KNOW THAT A BY PRODUCT SPECIFICALLY OF VANAROBIC LIKE COLLOSIS MEANING THE BREAK DOWN OF CARBOHYDRATES FOR FUELE A TYPICALLY IN A VERY FAST PAYS WITH LOW OXYGEN OF ILLABILITY THE DOWNSIDE OF THAT OQUATION IS ACID PRODUCTION WE KNOW THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM AS I I START THE CONVERSATION OFF THERE INTENTIONALLY SO WHAT IF WE COULD REDUCE THE ACID BUILD UP NI YOU NOW P H KIND OF WORKS I WENT AND COT A DOUBLE NEGATIVES THERE RIGHT YOU N WANT TOO MUCH ACID BUILD UT THEN COULD WE PROLONG AND SUSTAIN ENERGY IM IN A MORE EFFECT TO PACE ESPECIALL IN THIS ANAROBIC I'M INTERVAL KIND OF ENVIRONMENT AND AGAIN THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IN THOSE THINGS FAILURE IS NOT A RESULT A RUNNING OUT OF FUEL OR OYGEN IT'S A RESULT OF FATIGUE BUILDING UP WAY TOO QUICKLY IS I ALSO TRUE FOR RESISTANCE TRAINING E MAY BE BLOR OF THE THE TREATION VOSILATE SYSTEM THAT CAN BE IN ISSUE IT COULD SIMPLY BE IN ISSUE OF FORCE PRODUCTION YOU JUST DON'T HAVE AN A FORCE WE CEARE NOT OUT OF ENERGY YOU JUST CAN'T MUSTER ENOUGH I 'M FORCE YOU DO ENOUGH REPS AND IT'S CAN TO BE AN ISSUE THERE I CREATING FOSTER WITHON'T BE THE BIG WONTER DEMANTING I'M SO TO COME BACK A LITTLE BIT TO THE BEGINNING THEN I'LL I'M CIRCLING THIS ALTOGETHER INTENTIONALLY LLRIGHT WELL THE WAY THAT WE PRODUCE ENERGY IS GOING TO BE IN TWO PRIMARY CATEGORIES ANEROBIC ANEROBA COROBIC MEANING WITH OXYGEN ANEROBIC MEANING WITHOUT IN TERMS OF MUSCLE CONTRACTION YOU'REPRETTY MUCH TALKING ABOUT CARBOHYDRATES OR FAT NOW FAT IS GOING TO BE EXCLUSIVELY A RUBIC MEANING IMANY USE FAT FROM TE ENTIRE BODY ROUGHLY EQUALLY SO YOU'RE DOING A SPRINT UP A HILL AND YOUR HAND SRINGS OR YOUR GLUES YOUR QUADRON FIRE YOU CAN'T YOU'RE NOT DISTGOING TO USE THE FAT THAT'S DIRECTLY IN THOSE HAMSTRINGS YOUE GING TO LOSE IT FROM THE ENTIRE BODY IT HASE TO GO THROUGH LIKE POLLICESS SO IT'S IN TA STORED FORM AN NOT UPWOS TISSUE GOT O GET BROKEN DOWN PUT INTO BLOOD BLOOD'S GON TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH YOUR BODY GET TAKEN UP IN A MUSCLE TAKEAN UP THROUGH MUSCLE INTO THE MOTO CONDURE THERE WEN'T HAVE TO GO TRO THIS PROCESS CALL BATE OXIDATION SO REMEMBER CARBOHYDRATES AN GLUCO'S ESPECIALY IS THIS SIX CARBON MOLECUE FAT IF IT'S IN THE FORM OF A TRY GLISERIGHT IT IS IT THREE CARBON GLITERALL BACKBONE AND THREE YOU ON'T TRY ONE TO THREE FATTY ACIDS THREE CARBON BACKBONE AND THOSE FATTY ACES ARE JUST BIG LONG CHAINS OF CARON THAT'S ALL IT IS RIGHT SO WE'RE GIN AT BREAK THAT THING DOWN PUT IT IN THE BLOOD MOVE IT UP MOVE IT INTO OUR MOTO CONDURE YOU CAN'T WALK THOSE THINGS ACROSS A MOUNT O CONJUR WHILE TE'RE TOO BIG SO YOU HAVE TO DO IS CLEAVE THEM OFF INTO LITTLE CHUNKS AND IT TURNS OUT WE BREAK EM OFF INTO TWO CARBON CHUNKS WE CALL IT BATA AS IN TOO MOVE THOSE IN A MOTO CONJURE IF THAT CAN GO THROUGH THIS LITTLE THEN CALL CREBCYCLE OR TRACS ILA GACI CYCLE AND YOU KICK OUT A BONCH OF ENERGY OUT OF THAT YOU HAD TWO CARBONS SO AS RESULT OF THAT PROCESS YOU CN AGENERATE TOO CARBON TO OXIDES BUT REMEMBER YOU CAN ONLY GO TO THAT PROCESS IF OCTION IS VAILABLE ECAUS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PLACE THOSE CARBONS ON TO SOMETHING OR ACID GETS UP WAY TOO HIGH TOO FAST THIS IS ONEOF THE REASONS WHY FAT IS A NICE FUEL SORCE BUT IT'S VERY SLOW IT'S TAKES PHYSICAL TIME TO MOVE FROM THE BACK OF YOUR SHOULDER IN YOUR BLOOD DOWN YOUR HAND SRAYING UP TAKE UP TAKE UP TAK IN ADDITION IT'S REQUIRED OXIEN VAILABILITY IF YOU NEED ENGY FATER YOU SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO BRING IN THE OXYGEN TRANSPORT IT THROUGH GO THROUGH CAPILARIES EXCHANGED THROUGH TISSUE ET CETERA CAR A HYDRATE ON THE OTHER HAND IS CAN O BE STORED LOCALLY IN THE EXERCISING MUSCLE SELF AND SPECIFICALL IN TE CIDA PLASSUM TA'S GLAKOGEN THAT'S GLUKE  AS LIKAGEN IN THE STORA THERE SO WHAT'S CAN HAPPEN INITIALLY YOU'RE INITIAL DEMANDS FOR EXERCIER FOR FUEL ARE GOINGTO COME FROM THE GLIKAGEIN STORE WITH IN THE MUSCLE FIBER ITSELF IT'S SIS CON TO BREAK RIGHT THERE AND YOU TN BE OFF THE RACES SO YOUAT THE SIX CARBON MOLECULE YU TO BREAK IT INTO TWO SEPARATE THREE CARBON MOLECULES I' EEP BOME THAT BREAKING PROVIDE YOU A TINY BIT OF ENERGY VERY SMALL BUT SUM NOW YOUR TO TAKE THOSE TWO THREE CARBON MOLECULES AND YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO OXIDIZE THEM AS THAT'S YOUR ONLY NEXT STEP BUT ORDER TO DO THAT YOU GOT TO GO THOSE IN A MITE CONDREA SO YOU GOT A BREAK ONE OF THOSE MOLECULES OFF SO THEN YOU'LL BE BACK TO YOUR TWO CARBON MOLECULE TIST LIKE YOU DO WITH FAT THAT'S GONGOIN TO MATO CONDRE AND THEN'SGOINGO GO TO THE EXACT SAME CREB CYCLE TWO CARBONS ET CETERA BUT HOLD ON IF YOU DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT OXYGEN OR SUFFICIENT MITA CONDRY AVAILABILITY AND YOU'R STUCK AT THAT TWO THREE CARBON PLACS WHAT THE DO YOU DO YOU HAVE PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO SAY O CA WAIT A MINUTE WE HAVE TO A THREE CARBON MOLECULE AND WE HAVE A BUNC TO THIS ACID BUILD UP NOW ACID FUNCTIONALLY IS IS HYDROGEN THAT THAT'S WHAT PGH POTENTAL HYDROGEN IS WHAT PEACH STANDS FOR A RIGHT SO IF HYDROGES BUILDING UP AS A BY PRODUCT OF MUSCULAR CONTRACTION AND THE YOU'R HAVING THE THREE CARBON MLECULE WHAT IT CAN ACTUALLY DO IS GRAB ONE OF THOSE HYDROGENS AND THOSE THREE CARBMOLECULES BY THE MERICAL PROOVATOR PEROFIC ACIDRAGHT IF YOU TAKE A PEROVIC ACID AND YOU GRAB HYDROGEN PUT ON ON TOP OF IT WE NOW HAVE A DIFFERENT NAME FOR IT IT'S CALLED HYDROGEN PROXA LACTATE BAND GALL RIGHT THAT'S WHAT LACK DA LAC TO GACID IS RIGHT SO WE'VE NOW BUILT THAT UP SO NEVER ONE REASON WHY LACTIT'S NOT CAUSIN YOUR FORTAKE ITS ACTIALLY PREVENTING IT AND THAT DOESN'T WANCH O OTHER REALLY COOL STUP BUT THE POINT IS THAT SYSTEM CALLING LAST SO SO LONG THAT GET'S OVERWHELMED VERY QUICKLY WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THE REST OF THIS HYDROGEN WELL IF YOU STARTED OFF IN A NORMAL PATRANGE YOU DON'T HAVE VERY FAR TO GO BEFORE YOU'VE NOW GONE INTO THAT LEVEL OF TOO MUCH ACIDITY IF YOU START OFF IN A MORE BASIC AND A BASICAN A MEAN SIMPLE I MEAN CEMISTRY RIGHT AND MORE A'LK LINE THEN THAT SAME AMOUNT OF INCREASE IN P H IS NO LONGER NOW JUST PUT YOU BACK IN YOUR PHYSILEGE CARAN SO SOTOYN BY CARBONITE WHETHER TAKEN AS A CREAM OR A POWDER OR BEAKING SOTA OR ANYTHING ELSE CAN SIMPLY PUT YOU IN A MORE ALKLINE STATE EVEN ACUTELY THIS IS SOMETHING YOU CAN TAKE RIGHT NOW BEFORE YOUR YOUR WORK OUT AM YOU'RE GOING TO DELAY WHAT WE CALL DELAY THE PROGRESSION OF FATI AND OWOULD O WOULD PEOPLE START TO APPROACH THIS PRACTICE I BY UNDERSTANDIAS Y CAN DO THIS WITH COMMONO UM YOU KNOW STOREBOUT BAKING SODA NO QUESTION UMTHERE'S ALWAYS A CONC URN ABOUT GASTRIC DISTRABLEUM THAT IT'S A VERY EFFECTIVE LAXITIVE I'M SOMETIMES IN IT AND UNWANTED LAXITIVE EFFECT BUT HOW WOULD ONE APPROACH THIS BEFORE LET'S SAY I'M I'M GOING TO I'VE DOING THE MILE REPEATS YE EXERCISE A A MILE REPEATS A PROTOCALL THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER I'M DOING THAT FOR A FEW MONTHS AND NOW I WANT TO TRY THE SODIAN BY CARB YE PROCH IM WELL HIDRATE IT HOTHLY AND WELL RESTED IRAY TO GO WHEN AM I GET TO DRINK THIS U SODYAM BY CAR SOLUTION WHAT HOW WOULD I MAKE THE SOLUTION I LET' SAY I'M I TAKE TEN OUNCE AS WATER YE HOW MUCH BY CAR DO I WANT TO SOD HIM BY CARPSHIRE PUT IN THERE CAN WE COME UP WITH IT TUT IS IT HALF A TEASPOON IS A TEASPOON UM HERE'S O MEN TO TELL YOU YOU WILL THANK ME BY STARTING LOWER YOU CAN ALWAYS GO MORE LATER TO LITTLE PINCH YOU CANNOT GO BACK OBOUT I START WITH A QUARTER TEASPOON FINE HALF AN HONESTY HALF AS FINE HALF A TEAST TOONLY FINDS IS ALL THAT SET WILL THAT DOWN I  READ A STUDY RECENTLINY THAT SHOWE THAT PEOPLE WILL HIT THERE U THE THE PAK BENEFITS OF THIS AT DIFFERENT TIMES BUT IT'S SOMEWHERE IF I IF MEMORY SERVES ME CORRECTLY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SIXTEY AND NINETY MINUTES LATER SO I MOIGT WANT TO DRINK IT ON THE WAY TO THE TRACK IT CAN IT CAN BE AS LOW AS TWENTY OKI SO MAYBE UM AS I GET TO THE TRACKS AND SOMEBONE TO DO SOME WARM UP WITH SOME WALK AND JOGGING I I SAY FORTY FIVE MENUTES OK THT'S THAT I'M JUST A VERY ROUGH STANDERED BUT YET YOU'RE RIGHT IT IS IT IS INDIVIDUALIZED IM AND YOU PROBABLY WANT TO PLAY WITHOUT A LITTLE BIT IF NOT SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGBORHOOD OF TWENTY TO AN HOUR OK AND THEN UM THE PERCEIVED AND REAL FATIGUE IF DONE CORRECTLY THE PERCEIVED AND REAL FATIGUE OUGHT TO BE REDUCED YES I CAN DO MORE WORK WITHOUT FEELING EXHAUSTED WILL I FEEL LESS OF A LACK HATE BURNE YET DONE IN AIR QUOTES FOR THOSE LISTENING I REALIZE THAT'S A VERY CRUDE WAY TO DESCRIBE A COMPLEX PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS EUM FANTASTIC CAN SODYIM BY CAR BE USED REPEATEDLY FOR LONGER DURATION TRAINING YET AND IF I WERE GOIN TO USE IT WITH UM WAIT TRAINING FOR WHATEVER REASON MAYBE I'M DOING CIRCUIT TYPE TRAINING OR I'M DOING THE SUPERSET TYPE STRAINGTH TRAINING THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT BEFORE PUSHPOLE PUSHPOLE WHERS A LIE BIT MORE CARTY OF ASCULYRLY DEMANDING YE UM THEN MAYBE I SEP THAT THROUGHOUT THE WORK OUT MAKE SURE THERE'S A BATHROOM NEARBY IT SOUNDS LIKE CAUSE I DO I AM AWARE THAT A MANY PEOPLE GETS PRETTY SERIOUS GASTRICT DOS  HASK ME VERY QUICKLY OK GRAY WHELL SONS AGAN AMAZING TRAINING TOOL UM I REALLYAPPRECIATE YOU SHRINK CAUSE I THINK IT'S IT'S ONE THAT DOESN'T GET A LOT OF AIR TIME THESE DAYS CAUSE IT'S BEEN AROUND BUT UM SOUNDS LIKE IT HAS SOME PRETTY IMPRESSIVE I YE USE YOKNW A SORT OF FUNNY ABOUT THAT IS I MAY I GET IT POP COLTURE IS WHAT IT IS BUT STILL TO THIS DAY IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOR YOUR MOST EFFECTIVE GENERAL HELL SLACH PERFORMANCE SOMPLEMENTATION IT'S THE SAME THREE TO FORTO FIVE IN V BEEN THRE IT'S BECAUSE HEY WORK REALLY WELL WITHOUT GOING INTO THE CHEMISTRY OF EACH ONE IN THE PRACTICE EACH ONE ECAUSE I DEFINLY WANT TO GET YOU BACK TO TALK ABOUT TI IT NUTRITION AND SUPPLEMENTATION OH YUM AT SOME POINT BUT I THINK WE'D NEED A FULL COUPLE OF HOURS TO GET THAT RIGHT YE AT LEAST UM IF YOU AS A TEESER WOULD YOU MIND JUST LISTING OFF THE OTHER AM SUPPLEMENTS THAT YOU HAVE FOUND HER VERY EFFECTIVE FOR FOR MANY PEOPLE SO SOTING BY CARBOR BAKING SODS ONE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER ONE YET I WI'LL GO CIND OF REVERSE ORDER BATETO ALENANE AS ANOTHER VERY CLASSICALLY EFFECTIVE ONE IM SIMILAR IDEA E SUIN MY CARBONIT SOS ITS IT'S GOING TO BID ALENNES GOING TO COME MANS CAN BE CONVERTED STORED AS CALLED CARNESINE IN THE MUSSLEIN CARNESSINE IS AN INTEREST ON YOUR BUFFER SO ANOTHER WORDS IT'S IS GOING TO DELAY THE BUILD UP OF ASKIT I'M SO FETET BLOCKER IF YOU WELL SO VERY EFFECT A VERY CHEAP VERY SAFE 'M WELL STUDIED THE TOP ONE LOW OF ALL OF EM BY FAR THAT HAS AN INCREDIBLY STRONG SAFETY PROPHILE IT HAS IT IS A CHEAP IT IS A SIMPLE FORM TO GET HAS A IMPORTANT MAGNITUDE OF EFFECT AND IS AFFECT OF A CROSS MULTIPL DOMAINS OF PHYSICAL HALTH AND PERFORMANCE AND IT IS BECAUSE OF THAT IT IS MY CROWN JEEL IT IS IN MY OPINION WITHOUT QUESTION THE MICHAEL JORDAN OF ALL SUPPLIMENTATION AND THAT'S CREATING MON IDRAT IT EFFECTS SO MANY THINGS WE TYPICALLY THINK ABOUT IT AS ITS MUSCLE STO OR YOU YOU TALK CIND OF YOU QUICKLY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE CREATING PHOSPHATE SYSTEM BUT WE HAVE TO REALIZE I THE MASS MAJORITY RESERCH ON CREATING PHOSPHATE IS NOT INS MORE PERFORMANCE AND HAS NOT BEEN FOR TWENTY YEARS IT'S IN CLINICAL AND IT HAS EVERYTHING FROM EFFECTS ON THE LOGICAL SYSTEM TO THERE AVE BEN ASSOCIATIONS TO MENTAL HEALTH AND DEPRESSION AND TO BE VERY CLEAR I AM CERTAINLY NOT SAYING YOU CAN TAKE CREATING AND CURE ANYTHING AND I'M NOT SAYING IT'SCAN A STOP YOU FROM DEPRESSION OR ANYTHING BUT I'M SAYING THEREIS THERE'S A LOTT A RESEARCTH IN THESE AREAS AND THERS FOR REASON PEOPLE ARE DOING IT I COMPLETELY AGREE AND IF YOU'RE WILLING I'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU BACK FOR US TO DO A DISCUSSION ON CREATINE AND THE BRAIN OR CREATING IN THE NERVOUS SISDONTHERE'LL BE A LOT OF FUND AND MAYBE WE CAN DO IT A KIND OF A JOURNAL CLUB IN ADVANCE OF THAT ARES THA DON'T NOW JOURNAL CLUB IS WHERE IM SCIENTISTS A READ A MUNCH A PAPERS AND THEN ARGUE ABOUT THEM DISCUSS THEM AND TRY AN EXTRACT THA THE KIND OF I'M IAGREED UPON CENTER OF MASS IF YOU WILL II THINK AI'VE LONG BEEN TAKING FIVE GRAHAMS OF CRETIM ON A HIGHDRATE PER DAY FOR MAINLY FOR THE COGNATE OF A FACT IT I'M I SENSE AN EFFECT THAT'S OTLEASY ANECDATEA BUT  THINK THEY'RE A LOT OF DATE OUT THEIRS IS YIT IT T IS ENOUGH AT YOU'RE NOT YO'RENOT CRAZY THERE'S ENOUGH THERE AND IN FACT THRAS ENOUGH MECHANISM NOW I'M TO UNDERSTAND THE METABOLIC NEEDS PEOPLE THIN THE MATI A MUSSLOOK I RITE SOME GONG TO THINK ABOUT THEM TABOLISM NEEDED TO FUEL MUSCLE BUT WE FORGET CELLS IM UNCELLS RA BLOOD CELLS AND NERVE CELLS AST RA SIGHTS BRAIN ALL THE STUFF REQUIRES ENERGY AND IT'S ALL GOING THROUGH MHE TABILISM SUPERINTERESTING WE WE'LL DO THE DEAP DIVE ON THAT SOON I'VE A FINAL QUESTION FOR YOU YOU'RE INVOLVED IN A REALLY INTERESTING I THINK REALLY CUTTING EDGE PROJECT THAT I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT FROM YOU I DON'T KNOW OF ANYONE ELSE DOING ANYTHING I'M AS FORWARD THINKING AND FRANKLY AS RELEVANT TO THE GENERAL POPULATION BECAUSE OF A MY INTERESTING PEOPLE GETTING BETTER SLEEP AND O HOW TO DO THAT OF WHAITING STRESSLLOR ANYHOW DO THAT TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT I BELIEVE IT'S CALLED ABSOLUTE REST RIGHT SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN PLAYING WITH BEHIND THE SCENES IM FOR A LONG TIME THAN THIS TYPIY HAVE HIGH PERFORMANSEFF WORKS RIGHT PEOPLE WONT EXCLUSIVITY AND AND SO THIS AS BEEN BUILT I'M EFFECTILLY WHAT HAPPENED IS A FRIEND OF MINE CODYBIRKART NON IF YOU KNOW CODY BUT AF FAME D OUT IN TEXAS YE YENASSA NASAGA YE I DO KNOW CODY WONDERFUL JUST DOWN THE ROAD THINKER I'M EVERY ONE'S INTERESTED IN SLEEP RIGHT AND FOR FOREVER I UD HOW WERE USING WITH ATHLETES BUT EVERYTHING AVAILABLE TELLS YOU HOW YOU'RE SLEEPING NOTHING CAN TELL YOU WHY YOU'R LEEPING THAT WAY AND SO WE WE GOT TOGETHER AND BOLDER AND THEN I MET SOME HIS FORMER COLLEAGUES COMPUTER SCIENCE FOLKS I'M HARVARD EMDY IM AND SOME REALLY IMPRESSIVE TECK FOLKS AND WE WERE JUST THINKING ABOUT IDEA AND WE CAME UP WITH WE'STRY TO REALIZE THE PROBLEMS OR IT WE USE FIRST PRINCIPALE THINKING S OEN MY FAVORITE APPROACHES A IF YOU'VE  NOT FOR ME WITH THAT GO GOGTHAT LIKE THI JUST A RECIPE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS THIS FIRST PRENCIPLE THINKING AND WE JUSTARTER TO THINK ABOUT LIKE MAN ALL THE SLEEP TECAS IS THERE IT'S REAL I DON'T NEED TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT THEY NEED SLEEP EVERONE'S DONE THAT YOU NEED HIGH CHOL TO SLEEP BUT HOW CAN I FROM IDE SOLUTIONS AND WITHTHE PEOPLE I WORK WITH I CAN'T JUST TELL THEM YOUR TESTOSTRONS DOWN OR YOUR SLEEP DOWN O REC I NEED TO BEAPLE TO BE LIKE THIS IS DOWN AND HERES WHY AND HERE'S OUR SOLUTION THAT THAT'S HOW OUR HIGH PERFORMANCE WORLD WORKS SO ENTER ABSOLUTE REST THIS IS SAYING IOK WHATARE THE ACTUAL NODES THAT GO IN TO HIGH EFFECTIVE HIGH QUALITY SLEEP EVERY ONE IS PSYCHOLOGY SO THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF SCREENING DIGNOSTIC FOR ARE YOU NOTS SLEEPING BECAUSE OF SIMPLY YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOURSELF I NYOU'VE DONE A WONDERFUL JOB OF GIVING PEOPLE TOOLS OR IF YOU CAN'T QUITE YOUR MIND BEFORE SLEEP TO THIS IF YOU WAKE UP AND YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO SLEEP HERE ABOUT YOUR THINGS RIGHT SO WE HAVE SOME SCREENS THAT WE CAN DO IN THEIRE SOME THAT SUFF WE CAN DO TO ANALYZE THIS IS A PSYCHOLOGICALLITION IT'SIT'S NOT YOU'RE IN A CONTROL AND WE HAVE DIFFERENT TRICKS WE USE AND SUFF I'M HEN YO MACK WE TALK ABOUT BUT IT'S NOT THAT OK IS IT PHYSIOLOGY WHICH IS NO NUMBER TOO DO WE KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOPMAN LEVELS ARE LIKE DO WE KNOWHAT YOUR CERATONAN LEVELS ARE LIKE WHAT'S MELATONE AND LOOK LIKE WHAT'S THIS WHAT'S A DRANAL AND WHAT'S QUARTERS ALL QUARTERS ALL BEING THE PRIMARY DRIVER I'M WHAT WHAT IS THIS RELATIONSHIP TO   E WHERE ARE THESE THINGS AT SO WHET IT A MEASURE ALL THAT AND INTRACT THAT REAMESH THAT DURING THE DAY PRIOR TO SLEEP AN TI MAGERE THAT NEXT MORNING AND EVEN SOMETIMES THROUGHOUT SLEEP AND WHE ERE TO FIGURE OUT AS IS A PHYSIOLOGY PROM IF IT IS THAND WE HAVE CLEAR CORRECTIONS IF NOT WERE T GO ON THE NEXT UP WHICH IS IS HIS POSSIBLY APATHOLOGY SO YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF SLEEP DISORDER WERE IN AROUND FULL PET WHAT'S CALL PEST SOPPOISYNOGRAPHY AFULL THE EXACT SAME STUFF YOU WOULD GET ANY SLEEP CLINEC I' IT'S TA SCENSOR THAT'S GOINGTO GO ON MERIMEASURING E G E O G AN WERE TO HAVE A MUSCLE ACTIVATIENT ANSER TO SEE IF YOUR LEGS AR RE MOVING AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS GOING ON AND W CEU GET A FULL DIGNOSIC AND I IF ANY ONES OR DONE THIS THE AMOUNT OF A SLEEP ISSUES THAT OR HAPPENING IN PEOPLE THAT THE DON'T EVEN REALIZE IS EXTRAORDINARILY HIG SO WERE TO FIGRE THIS OUT ON ONE VERY QUICK EXAMPLE WE JUST TO THIS WITH AE PROFESSIONAL ATLY AN HE WAS HAVING LIKE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY ROUGHLY OF THESE EPISODES PER NIGHT AND TO BE CATEGORIZES AND EPISODE THE HAVE TO MEET THESE FOUR SPECIFIC RIGHT TO YOURYA OXTION SATURATION VENTILATION CHANGES BRAIN CHANGES TO SECTUR IN ANY HIT THAT OVERTURNITY TIMES TO NIGHT AND WHAK THIS TECHNOLOGY ALLOWED US TO DO HIS FIGURE OUT WHAT POSITION DID ALL THE THINGS OCCURRENT WELL IN HIS PARTICULAR CASE MOST OF THEM ARE HAPPENING WAS ON HIS BACK AND S WE'VE BOUGHT A A VERY SIMPLE TAT PELLO BASICALLY THET WHEN ON HIS BACK THAT KEPT HIM FROM

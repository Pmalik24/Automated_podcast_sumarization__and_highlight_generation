A LOT OF CONTRADICTIONS IN YOUR HEAD AT ONCE ILIA IS GETTING PRETTY GOOD AT IT VALLEY CANNESS ONE OF THEPUORS OF OURSHA AWAYS MOMEN SIS TO FINALLY DID MAKE IT MARRIABLE AND SURPRISE THE GRANDPARENTS ALLYOU IS THER TO FILLMENTTHERE  AS REGRESSION PRESENT IN FINE AMERE PRUDENT SIDE DCREE TO MADE FOUR REGIONS OF YOU CRANE INTO PART OF RUSSIA OFFICIALLY ICOODING WHAT ALIA IS RIGHT NOW THE NIGNATION SECRETARY GENERAL SAID THE MOVE WENT Q AGAINST EVERYTHING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS MEANT TO STAND FOR I TO OH WHAT A HANGLED WEB WE WEAVE QUICKGETS UP BEFORE WE START THE STORY THAT DIMENSIONS PART OF THE MALE AND ATAMY THEY THAT UNDER ADVISEMENT PRO AND CON DESIDE WHAT YOU GING TO DO IT IS NOT WHAT THE STORY IS ABOUT THE STR IS ABOUT A CREEPY AND DANGEROUS CREATURE THAT IS ALL KINDS OF TERRIBLE THINGS THIS AUS ABOUT SOMEBODY WHO TAKES ISSUE WITH EVERY WORD I JUST SAID ABOUT THAT CREATURE LILY ELLEVAN MET UP WITH THIS PERSON TO HEAR ER OUT THIS PERSON IS MY FRIEND KELSY PATCHET AND IF YOU RUN IN TO HER AT A DINNER PARTY ARE ABAR MAYBE YOU HAPPEN TO BE STANDING BEHIND HER IN THE SECURITY LYING AT THE AIR PORT SHE MGHT ASKYO THIS WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT BLACK WOO O SPIDERS WHAT YOU KNOW O K UM I KNOW THAT THEY ARE VERY POISONOUS LIKE THEY HAVE A REALLY BAD BITE LIKE A BITE THAT CAN KILL YOU HE AND DAM AND I KNOW THAT THE FEMALE AFTER MATING LAKE KILLS THE MALE AND EATS HIM FANTASTIC THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT MOST PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT BLACKWOOD OF SPIDERS AND YOUR TOTALLY WRONG AND THIS IS KELSIE'S MISSION TE EXPOSE THE LIES ABOUT THE SPIDER BEING A WANTON MURDERESS CORRECT THE RECORD AND RESTORE HER GOOD NAME KELSIE S TO WORK AS A PARK RANGE ER IN NEW YORK BY THE WAY SHE ELSIE IS TO REPORT SCIENCE STORIES AND OVER THE YEARS SHE IS A MASS AND ABSURD AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THESE SPIDERS SO LET ME IT LET ME TELL YOU UM I'LL START WITH THA THE BLACK WIDOW NAME THE IDEA THAT THE BLACK WIDOW EATS HER HUSBAND OR THE SPIDER THEY JUST MATED WITH THAT SHE YOU KNOW IS A IS A MURDERER DRESTALL IN BLACK UM MORNING A HUSBAND THAT THEY JUST KILLED KELSIE SAYS THE FEMALE EATING THE MALE OK THIS HAS HAPPEN BUT VERY RARELY AND IT'S BARELY A NOTICEABLE TRAIT IF YOU LOOK AROUND ABOUT THE REST OF SPIDERS ARE DOING MANY SPECIES OF BABY SPIDERS WHICH ARE CALLED SPIDER LINGS UM OFTEN EAT THEIR IBBLINGS RIGHT AFTER HATCHING AND SOME SPECIES OF SPIDERLINGS EVEN EAT THEIR OWN MOTHER AFTER HATCHING AND SEXTUAL CANNIBALISM WHICH IS LIKE EATING YOUR MATE AFTER HE HAS DONE THE DEED WITH YOU IS VERY COMMON IN THE SPIDER WORLD BUT YOU KNOW WHOSE WHO IS NOT COMMON THAT MUCH FOR IS BLACKWOOD OW SPIDERS THEY ONLY DO THIS IN CAPTIVITY IT PRACTICALLY NEVER BEEN SEEN IN THE WILD IN THE NORTHERN HEMOSPHERE MEANWHILE THE MALE SPIDER HERE'S NO MISTER ROGERS CHECK OT WHAT HE DOES SO THE MALE BLACK WIDOW WILL SOMETIMES GO ROUND TO THE THE FEMALES WEB AND SORT OF CLIP OFF LITTLE PARTS OF IT SO THAT SHE HAS NO EXTIT ROUTS AND THEN HE WILL GO UP NEXT TO HER AND LIKE CALMLY LIKE SORT OF CARESS HER AND THEN HE THROWS A WEB OF HIS OWN OVER HER TO THEN COPULATE WITH HER AND THE SCIENTISTS HAVE CALLED THAT WEB THE BRIDALE VELE WHICH IS SO NOT WHAT THAT SHOULD BE CALLED ARE YOU SERIOUS OI CU THIS IT STRIKES ME AS A VERY WEIRD BEHAVIOR AND IF I WERE A PERSON NAMING SPIDERS AND SAW THAT SOMETIMES THE FEMALE EIGHTE THE MALE AFTER EATING BUT ALSO THAT THE MALE DOES THIS CRAZY THING AND LIKE TIES DOWN THE LADY BASICALLY I MIGHT NAME THE SPIDER AFTER THAT BUT WHY DIDN'T THEY BECAUSE THEY WERE MEN HE THOUGHT IT WAS EXCEPTIONAL THAT THE FEMALE KILLED THE MALE MY GUSH CAN'T HAVE THAT A LOT OF SPECIES OF SPIDERS DO THIS BRIDAL MALE THING WONE THEORY AS THEHONE CELCY LAYS OUT THAT THE MALE'S TRAPPING THE FEMALE THERE'S ANOTHER NEWER ONE TO WHICH IS MORE ACCEPTED BY SCIENTISTS NLE TETE IT'S MORE AS SEDUCTION THAN A TRAP AS SCIENTIS PUT IT WHEN THEY EXPLAINED IT TO ME IT'S BONDADGE YET SPIDEIS TY BONDAGE NIT NUMBER TAI THAT HER BITE IS FATALE SO FROM NINETEEN FIFTY TO NINETEEN FIFTY NINE THE DATA WE HAVE SAYS THAT THE WERE SIXTY THREE DEATHS IN THE UESS FROM BLACKWOIDOW SPIDERS INTERESTING WAY MOST OF THE BLACK WIDOW BITE VICIMS BACKMAN SEEM TO BE MALE IN AN OLDER STADY THEY WERE EIGHTY PER CENT MALE HERE'S A THEORY AS TO WY SO MOST OF THE REPORTED A BLACK WIDOW BITES FROM THIS TIME HAPPENED IN WHAT WERE CALLED OUTDOOR PRIVIES A OUTHOUSES H SO BLACK WIDOW SPIDERS THEY ENJOY DARK LODE THE GROUND SORT OF PLACES THEY ESPECIALLY LOVE TO MAKE THEIR COB WEBS BETWEEN TWO OBJECTS AND SO BECAUSE BUGS LIKE STINKY PLACES YOU KNOWE LIKE IMAGINE FLIES  RIGHT THIS FLIES IN OUTHOUSES THAT IT MAKES A GREAT LIKE FOOD SUPPLY RIGHT HA AND TO GET TO THE STINKY STUFF YO GOT TO GO THROUGH THE BOWL RIGHT RI SO PUTTING YOUR WEB THERE IS EXCELLENT  SO IMAGINE THIS IS NINETEEN FIFTIES YOUR DUD YOU NEED TO GO NUMBER TO YOU MAKE YOUR WAY OUT TO THE OUTHOUSE  SIT DOWN AND YOU JUNK TANGLES THERE HANGLES YET THAT'S BUT SHE SAID AND AS IT DOES IT HITS THE COB WE AND THE USUALLY NONAGGRESSIVE BLACK WIDOW IT STINCTUALLY RUNS OVER AND BITES DOWN ON THE NEW CREATURE THAT IS LANDED ON ITS WEB MY GOD OGET THAT DON'T LIKE CENN TERRIFYING NOW IT IS ISN'T IT YE YET THERES LIKE I NOT EVEN YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE A BETTER SITUATION TAILOR TO GETTING BITS BY THIS PLIKE USUALLY VERY NONAGROSSIVE SPDER THEY DON'T COME AFTER YOU AND THE STATISTIC THAT YOU SAW YET HOW MANY BITES WERE ON PENUSIS THE MAJORITY WERE ON ON PETUSIS ON'T WIT DOT SHE THINKS ALL THESE PENIST SPITES HAPPENING SO REGULARLY MIGHT BE ONE OF THE REASONS THERE WERE SO MANY DEATHS SPACK THEN THE SKIN THERE IS LESS THICK AND THERE ARE LOTS OF NERVES THERE RIGHT AND THIS IS A NARROW TOLKS IN VENOM SO OH OH OH PERHAPS BEING BIT ON THE GENITALS SINS THE VENOM GOING INTO YOUR BODY LIKE A FAST OR STRONGER WAY THAN SAY IF YOU WERE BIT ON A CALLOUS ON YOUR FOOT ANYWAY THE POINT IS ONCE MORE PEOPLE HAD INDOOR PLUMMING ALONG WITH IMPROVED ACKS ISTE MATICAL CARE THE NUMBER IS WHICH WEREN'T THAT HIGH TO BEGIN WITH THEY'VE GONE WAY DOWN AND IN THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES THERE'S NO RECORD OF ANY ONE DYING FROM A BLACK WOOD OW SPIDER NO ONE IN FACT THE BLACKWOOD HAS USUALL A PRETTY SHY SPIDER SCIENTIST IV EVENS AND TESTS WHERE THEY POKE AND PROWD HER TRYING TO LESS AT A BITE AND SHE TURNS TO OTHER DEFENCES PIRST TRIES TO RUN AWAY CURLS UP INTO A LITTLE BALL N TA BIGGER THAN A QUARTER SOMETIME SHE THOSE SILK AT THE DANGER TO TRY TO ESCAPE THE BITE IS HER LAST RAS ORT SO YE I THINK THAT THE WORLD SHOULD KNOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN LIED TO AND THAT THIS THIS  THE BLACK WOTD O SPIDERS NOT THE BET CELSIE HAS A PROPOSAL TO SET THE RECORD STRAHTE SCHANGE THE SPIDER'S NAME EASY GET RID OF THE NAME THAT MIRES HER AND ALL THIS TWISTED LOER SHE DOESN'T DESERVE I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE RE NAMING HER BLACKWOOD OF SPIDERS WERE NOT ALWAYS CALLED LAERS S THEY'VE HAD MANY DIFFERENT NAMES SOME OF THE NAME AR THE HOUR GLASS SPIDER THE TEA BAR SPIDER THE ME WALK PEOPLE INTIGIONISTOC CALIFORNIA CALLED THE SPIDER BOCOL MO THE ONE SHE LIKES BEST THOUGH THE SHOE BUTTON SPIDER SO KU THE SHOE BUTTON SPIDER YET SHE LOOKS LIKE A BUTTON AFTER ALL LITTLE ROUND ONE SO I DECIDED TO TEST OUT THIS NEW NAME ON THE PEOPLE I THOUGHT WERE THE BEST SUITED TO JUDGE IT WAS LIKE MY WHOLE CHEST WAS IN A WIC SCRIP I SPOKE WITH EIGHT PEOPLE WHO'D BEEN BITTEN TALKD TO LEVEN OTHERS OVER YEMAL HERE IS SOME OF THEM AND NOT TO LIKE THE WORST CRAMP IT YOU' EVER HAD IN YOUR WIFE LIKE A CARLEY HORSE INGER LIKE BUT THAT BEING MY HOLE BACK BIT AR REALLY BAD SHARWY HORSE AT DOESN STALK AND EN VOPS YOUL CHASSTRAY    QUI TING AT MY BODY AND I WOULD LIKE HOLDING ON POU THE BIE PANNELE OTH THE VEHICLE AND BRATHING MYSELF WHEN IT WOUL HAPPENING AND PRI IT RERELY ENOT I CANNOT RENDERED LIKE  I WIK BUT IF YEEL LIKE TO GO IN WAVER NOT EVERY ONE WHOSE BIT HAS A BATD REACTION LIKE THIS AND AGAIN BITES ERE VERY RARE AND A LOT OF THE TIMES THERE MILD BUT WHEN IT'S BAD IT'S BAD SO I RAN TELLS HIS IDEA BY THEM DO YOU THNK WE SHOULD RE NAME THE BLACK WOOD O

THAT'S IN A MINUTE CHICAGO BUBGREDIO WHEN OUR PROGRAMME CONTINUES TO SMARAN LIFE AMIRA GLASSD TO DAY'S PROGRAMME SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT STORYES TO PEOPLE WHO FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT THEY HAVE TO CLARIFY WHAT'S TRUE AND WHAT'S FALSE BUT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM WEAVARRIVED TO DACT THREE OF OUR PROGRAMME AT THREE YOU F NO SO FIDERDAY WITH HOR TO BUNCH OF PEOPLE SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON SOMETHING AND NOW IT IS MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE OURE SENIOR EDITOR DAVID CESTONBOUN WHO'S USUALLY VERY MEASURED SOMETHINGHE WANTS TO GET OFF HIS CHEST THE THING I'D LIKE THE RECORD SET STRAIGHT ON YOU FOS ARE NOT REAL THEY ARE NOT ALIENS FROM OTHER PLANETS COME TO THIS AT US YES I KNOW THE PANAGON RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THE NEW PROGRAMM TO STUDY WEIRD STUFF PILOTS ARE SEEING YES I KNOW THERE WAS THAT SUPEROLONG NEW YORKER STORY OR MAYBE YOU SAW THE SIXTY MINUTES PIECE WE HAVE TRACKLED MANY STRANGE STORIES ON SIXTY MINUTES BUT PERHAPS NONE LIKE THIS IT WAS PRETTY GOOD TEETHY S WHAT YOUARE TILLING ME IS THAT YOU IN FOOLS UNIN DINTOFO SLING OBJETS OR REAL BEY'LL A SEEP WER BEYOND THAT READY UNIDENTIFIED DOES NOT MEAN ALIEN SPACE CRAFT IT MEANS UNIDENTIFY OR MAYBE YOU SAW THESE VIDIOS THE NAVY RS AND EVEN EVEN THI SKY WHAT IS TRUE MESRY BESERS OR RESIDENT OROM ERS CORTE AND RECORD O OBJECTS IN ISCIS THAT WE O NO EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE WECAN EXPLAIN OW THEY MOVE HEYR TROJECTORY EY DO NOT A UN EASILY ESPLAINABLE  PARTICULARLY MADDENING OUR CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD WITH PEOPLE I KNOW ABOUT THIS AND MIDWAY THROUGH I REALIZE OH I HAVE TO BE POLITE BECAUSE IT'S CLEAR THEY THINK THIS IS REAL NO MORE POLITE I HAVE REASONS FOR THINKING ALL THIS IS BULLSHIT SCIENCE REASONS FOR ALIENS THOT ACTUALLY VISIT US IF THEY EXIST IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY WOULD EITHER NEED TO BE INSANELY PATIENT OR BE ABLE TO TRAVEL FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT CAUSE THE NEAREST STARS ARE CRAZY FAR AWAGHT I WAS A GRADS TODNT IN PHYSICS I WORKED ON ONE OF THOSE GIANT PARTICLE EXCELERATORS I CAN TELL YOU YOU CAN TRY TO MAKE THOSE PARTICLES GO AS FAST AS YOU WANT THEY GET VERY CLOSE TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT BUT THEY DO NOT GO FASTER WE GOT TO NINETY NINE POINT NINE NINE NINE NINE FIVE FOUR PERSENT TOF THE SPEED OF LIGHT YOU CAN DOUBLE THE MOUN OF ENERGY USING AND IT DOESN'T DOUBLE THE SPEED IT JUST GETS YOU A TINY BIT CLOSER TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT THE UNIVERSE REALLY DOES SEEM TO HAVE A SPEED LIMIT THAT'S WHAT THE AQUATIONS TELL US I MEAN MAYBE THERE IS SOME WAY AROUND IT BUT IT REALLY REALLY DOES NOT SEEM LIKE IT AND THINK ABOUT IT FOR A SECOND IN THE FIFTIES IT MAY BE MADE SENSE THAT ALL THE OUOVOTERS WERE BLURRY AND HARD TO DECIPHER BUT TO DAY EVERY SINGLE PERSON WITH A SMARTPHONE HAS A SUPERPOWERFUL CAMERA IN THEIR P OCKET THAT'S BILLIENS OF CAMERAS IF ALIEN SPACECRAFT ARE HERE SHOULDN'T WE HAVE BETTER PICTURES  AND THE FACT THAT BASICALLY KNO SCIENTIST SEEM INTERESTED IN THIS AT ALL AND PREFER TO DWELL ON SAY DETAILED QUESTIONS OF HOWE SOLDAR SYSTEMS FORM IT TELLS YOU SOMETHING IF ANY THESE PHOTOES ARE RADE OUR BLIPS OR WHATEVER REALLY WERE ALIEN CRAFT IT WOULD BE THE GREATEST DISCOVERY OF ALL TIME I CAN'T THINK OF A FONT BIG ENOUGH FOR THE FRONT PAGE BUT BASICALLY EVERY SCIENTIST AND EVERY UNIVERSITY IS SITTING IT OUT AS KNEEL TO GRASSTISON THE ASTROPHYSISIST WHO RUNS THE PLANETARIUM ATHE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY PUT IT HO'S TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THESE THINGS ARE SPACIIPS QUOT THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS IS NOT EVIDENCE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS O K YOU KNOWIY SCIENCE EXISTS HE SAYS CAUSE THE HUMAN SENSORY SYSTEMSEVS UNFORTUNATELY WITH SCIENTIS OUF DOING YOU KNOW SCIENCE THERE IS ALMOST NO ONE LEFT TO TRY TO SET THE RECORD STRYS NO ONE TO QUOTE IN THOSE NEW STORIES SAYING YOU KNOW THINK THAT'S JUST A WEATHERBALLOON IF THEY DO QUOTE SOME ONE IT'S OFTEN THIS GY MAC WEST I'VE LOOKED A LITERALLY HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF YOU FOCASIS PEOPLE SEND BE THEM OLD TIME AND IS ALWAYS NEW ONE'S COMING UP MAC

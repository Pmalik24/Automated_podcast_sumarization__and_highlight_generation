A QUICK WARNING THERE ARE CURSE WORDS THAT ARE UNBEEPED IN TODAYS EPISODE OF THE SHA IF YOU PREFER A BEEP VERSION YOU CAN FIND THAT AT OUR WEBSITE THIS AMERICAN LIFE DOTAWORK EVEN IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVY OF FEELS LIKE YOU'VE SEEN THIS MOVY FLYING SAW SER LANCS ON EARTH HUGE CROWD GATHERS ROUND SCARED TEINSITED THEIR PARENTS WITH KIDS ALSO THE ARMY COUP OF TANKS SOLDIERS POINT GUNS OF THE DOOR OF T SPACESHIP WHICH AS CLOSED  THEN IT OPENS SO I FOE GOURMURGS STEPS FORWARD AND SPEAKS WE A WELL CRA LOOKS UNEASY SOLDIERS RAS ERE CONES HIGHER IS YOE REALLY TELLING THE TRUTH ELAANS COME TO EARTHME F YO SQUARELY DIVIDE OFF INTO TWO CAMPS THERE ARE THE ONES WHERE THEY WON TO BE OUR FRIENDS THAT'S CLOSENCOUNTERS THAT SE T A RIVAL THE H STAR TRIE MOVY ABOUT THE MOMENT THAT HUMANS FIRST MEET EXTRA TERRESTRIALS AND THEN THERE AR THE FILMS WHERE THE ALIENS WHEN IT KILL US  GENERALLY WAYMORE FUN AN DEPENDENCE DAY WORE THE WORLDS A MEN IN BLACK FILMS THE AVENGERS  FILL KNO SINCLA SIN AND ALWODY SAYS ABOUT US AS A SPECIYE BUT WE MAKE WAY MORE FILMS ABOUT CREATURES WHO GO SO FAR OUT OF THEIR WAY LIKE THEY TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILES LAHT YEARS WITH THE SOLE PURPOSE OF WANTING TO KICK OUR ASSES AND A LOTS OF THESE FILMS HERE'S THAT MOMENT WHEN THE ALIENS FIR SURRIVE FOR WE KNOW WHAT THE GIN TO DO WERE THE HUMANS WONDER WHICH FILM ARE WE AN UT THESE GISES FRANGLY ARE NOT TO DAY N OR SHAL WE THE PEOPLE OF EARTH MEET NON HUMANS STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND THEM AND THE QUESTION IN THE STORIES AN TO DAY SHO IS NOT WHELE THEY DO US HARM BUT THE MORE DIFFICULT AND MORE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION WHY ARE THEY ACTING THE WAY THEIR ACTING THESE NONN HUMANS WHYTS GOING THROUGH THEIR HEADS DID HE WA OFE A STORY OF MACHINE INTELLIGENCE WE HAVE OCEAN CREATURES WORKING IN WEIGHT IF A STORY FROM DEEP SPACE AND ONE FROM AS SCAPE PART AND WASHING IN STATE FROM D  BASY CHICAGO ITS THIS AMERICAN LIFE FELLOWER THINGS STHEY WITH US AT ONE FIRST CONTACT ON' KNO BAT YOU BUT HERE'S SOMETHING THAT I HAVE NEVER TALKED ABOUT OR THOUGHT ABOUT MUCH TILL THE LAST SIX MONTHS OR SO A IY EVER SINCE CHA G B T AND IT'S UPGRADES AND SPEN OFFS START RONIY OT PUBLICLY LAST NOVMEMBER IS BEN DOING SUCH AMAZING THINGS RITING GETS TURM PAPERS PASSING THE BAR EXAM IT DORDINER TIMES REPORTER TO WEVE HIS WIFE BECAUSE IT LOVES HIM MORE THIS IS NOW THE NEXT BIG BATTLE AMONG TET COMPANIES HO'S GON ROWT THE BEST TA IY ALL SINCE CHA G B T AND THAT IS THE NON HUMAN FORCE THAT THE PEOPLE OF EARTH AR TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IN THIS FIRST ACT AND SO MUCH OF THE COVERAGE ABOUT THIS NEW GENERATION OF A EYE AS FOCUST ON IMPORTANT QUESTIONS LIKE WHOS GOING TOWAYS JOBS BECAUSE OF THIS DOES MAKE OUR WORLD BETTER MORE DANGEROUS COULD THE I HAVE ACTUAL CATESTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES FOR US BUT IR SEEN YOUREDEROR DAVID CASTG ABOUT TNOTICE THAT NOBODY'S TALKING MUCH ABOUT A BASIC A GOND OF PROFOUND QUESTION HAVE THE COPUTERS CROSS SOME CONNOLINE AND NOTHER ACTUALLY DEVELOPING A SORT OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCE AND ON'T BE COYT WHAT I MEAN BY THAT BECAUSE THERE'S NOT AND AGREED ON DEFINITION OF WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IF YOU LOOKING FOR HUMAN INTELLIGENCE AND A COMPUTER BUT ONE WAY THAT SCIENTIST THING ABOUT THIS IS BTHE COMPUTER CAN ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND LANGUAGE NCONCEPTS AND IT CAN REASON THROUGH PROBLEMS BUT TO BE CLEAR IS COMPLETELY UNLIKE THE COMPUTERS THAT WE'VE HAD TILL NOW UT YOU BASIT WE JUST FANCY CALCULATORS WIN THOUSANDS OF VINES OF INSTRUCTIONS WHEN YOU GOUL FOR A CASTIRON SKILET THE SOFF WORD DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT A CAST IRON SKILL IT IS IT JUST SEARCHING FOR THOSE WORDS AN SOME BIG DEETO BAS OR SOMEHING LIKE THAT IF HUMANS THIS YEAR IF FINALLY CREATED IN TELLIGENT MACHINES THIT CAN UNDERSTAND IND REASON WITH HIS NEW GENERATION OF A EYE THAT IS AN EARY AND IMPORTANT TURNING POINT FOR A WHOLE SPECIES DEBAD TALK TO A MUCH RESEARCHERS WHAVE BEEN LOOKING INTO THIS TRYING TO RUT OUT THIS EXACT QUESTION HERE EIS I THINK EVERYONE ONCE THEY START PLAYING AROUND WITH SOMETHING LIKE CHAT G B T HAS A KIND OF WHOLLY SHIT MOMENT FOR ME IT WAS WHEN I TYPED THIS INTO IT GIVE ME A CHOCOLATECHIP COOKY RECIPE BUT WRITTEN IN THE STYLE OF A VERY DEPRESSED PERSON IT RESPONDED INGREDIENTS ONE CUP BUTTER SOFTENED IF YOU CAN EVEN FIND THE ENERGY JO SOFTEN IT ONE TEASPOON VANELLA EXTRACT THE FAKE ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR OF HAPPINESS ONE CUP SEME SWEET CHOCOLATE CHIPS TINY LITTLE JOYS THAT WILL EVENTUALLY JUST MELT AWAY IT REALLY WAS QUITE GOOT CHATCI P T DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE INNERNET BUT IF IT GET IT MUST BE COPYING THIS FROM SOMETHING IT HAD SEEN ON THE UNINET WHEN IS BEING TRAIN I SPENT A LONG TIME LOOKING AND COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING LIKE IT THIS CHOCOLATCHOP COOKY RECIPE I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW WAS POSSIBLE IT'S PARTICULARLY SHOCKING IF YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THINGS LIKE CHAT G B T WORK ITS NOT THE SORT OF TRADICIONAL COMPUTER PROGRAM WHERE YOU GIVE THE MACHINE EXPLICIT DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS LIKE IF SOME ONE ASK FOR A RECIPE TYPE THESE WORDS BACK OR TO MAKE SOME ONE SOUND DEPRESSED REPLACE THIS WORD WITH THAT WORD CHATCHI P T IS DIFFERENT IT' SOMETHING CALLED A LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL AND HERE'S HORE THEY WORK READY CHACI P T HAVE BEEN TRAINED REALLY TO JUST DO ONE VERY PARTICULAR THING PREDICT WHAT THE NEXT WORD IN A SEQUENCE MIGHT BE  CONE A LIKE WHEN YOUR TEXTING ON YOUR PHONE AND YOUR TYPE SORRY I'M GOING TO BE HOME AND IT SUGGESTS LA THAT'S HOW THIS THING OPERATED IT TYPES SOME WORDS IN THIS CASE GIVE ME A CHALCASHIP COOKY RESPE IN THE STYLE OF THE DEPRESSED PERSON AND IT NOTES THE WORDS THE ORDER THER IN DOES SOME MATH BASED ON ALL THE THEXTATS BEEN TRAINED ON AND IT COMES UP WITH WHAT IT CALCULATES TO BE THE MOST LIKELY WORD TO COME NEXT IT TYPES THAT ONE WORD ON THE SCREENE THEN IT GOES BACK AND DOES IT AGAIN LOOKS AT THE RECIPE QUESTION PLOSSTS THE ONE WORD IT JUST PIT OUT AND SAYS WHAT WORDSHIPD COME NEXT IT IS NO IDEA WERE ITS GOING IT DOESN'T KNOW THE LAST WORD IT'S WORKING OFF OF IS ONE THAT IT JUST PIT OUT ITSELF IT'S JUST DOING THIS APPARENTLY DONE THING OVER AND OVER UNTIL IT HAS WHOLE SENTENCES IN PARAGRAPHS AND YET THIS RECIPE ONE TEASPOON VANILLA EXTRACT THE FAKE ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR OF HAPPINESS HOW COULD SOMETHING MADE IT SUCH A DUMB MECHANICAL WAY O THET AL THERE ONLY TWO POSSIBILITIES REALLY THE FIRST ONE IS THAT SOMEHOW AS IT LEARNED TO PREDICT THE NEXT WORD THIS MACHINE BECAME INTELLIGENT WHICH LIKE I WAS A VISICIST FOR A BIT A SIGNS REPORTED FOR A DECADE THIS WOULD BE THE MOST STARTLING THING I HAVE EVER SEEN SO THAT'S THE FIRST POSSIBILITY HUMANS CREATED A MACHINE WITH HUMAN LIKE INTELLIGENCE THE OTHER POSSIBILITY IT IS A LOT LESS EXCITING THE OTHER POSSIBILITY IS THAT WE ARE FOOLING OURSELVES FORT RONAN ELDAN A MATHEMATICION AT MIKROSOV TOLD ME HE WAS VERY SCEPTICAL ABOUT THESE LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS IT'S EASY TO BE FOOLD INTO THINKING WHE UNDERSTAND MORE THAN THEY DO HE TOLD ME THIS LITTLE A PARABLE SO THIS THE STORY ABOUT MY WIFE ACTUALLY SO MY WIFE AND I SOME TIME GO WE WERE WALKING TOGETHER IN TELL A VVAN WE MEED THE MATH PROFESSOR YOU'LL SEE WHY WHAT I'M GETTING GET SO WE RUNNING THROUGH THE SMOUTH PROFESSOR AND TELLS ME SOMETHING LIKE OH HOW WAS IT GOIND THESE DAYS ON LOOKIN GAT LIKE A I SUPEREMETRY ON SECTIONS OF THE DISCREET HYPROCUBE AND MY WIFE HAS NO IDEA ABOUT WHAT ANY OF THESE WORDS MEAN JUST A KIND OF AMUSE HERSELF SHE SAYS HOW YOURE BASEALLY LOOKING AT THE JOHNSON GRAP WHICH WAS JUST SOME PHRASE SHE'D PICKED UP AROUND RONAN TURN OUT TO BE EXACTLY RIGHT AND THE GUYGOS OH YOU ARE MATHEMATICION TOO SHE'S A PSYCHOLOGIST RONAND SAYS THIS IS KIND OF A PARTY TRIC SHE DOES SH CAN BULSHED HER WAY THROUGH ANY TOPIC FOR A COUPLE MINUTES AND THIS HE FELT SURE THIS IS WHAT A E MODELS LIKE CHAT G B T WERE DOING YOU KNOW THE GIVE YOU THE IMPRESSION THE UNDERSTAND WHAT THEYARE SAING WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING GANYTHING YOU KNOW THE JUST HAVE THTS LIKE YOU REALLY GOOD STATISTICAL MACHINEG THAT KNOWS WHAT THE RIGHT WORDS ARE LIKE IN MANY DIFFERENT CONTEXTS AND AS YOUILL KEEP IMPROVING THE MODELS MAYBE IT CAN AST O LITTLE BETS MOREING THE CONVERSATION UNTIL YOU BASICALLY EXPOSE THAT IT'S JUST BULSHITING A LOT OF RESEARCH BACT THIS UP CHAT G B T WOULD SPIT OUT STUFF THAT MADE SENSE BUT THEN IT WOULD GO OFF THE RAILS SAY THINGS THAT WERE OBVIOUSLY RIDICULOUS MAYBE IT WASN'T MORE THAN JUST A VERY GOOD BULCHET MACHINE THAT AT LEAST IS WHERE THINGS STOOD UNTIL LAST SEPTEMBER WHEN A NEW AND IMPROVED VERSION OF CHAT G P T ARRIVE THET MADE RONAN AND A BUNCH OF HIS COLLEAGUE'S QUESTION EVERYTHING I WONDER IF MAYBE SOMETHING HAD CHANGED MAYBE WE HAD CROSS SOME LINE THIS BRINGS ME THE STORY I WANT TO TELL YOU IT TAKES PLACE WHERE RONAN WORKS ON THE CAMPAS OF MICROSOT HEADQUARTERS IN REDMAN WASHINGTON STATE MUCH OF IT IN A BUILDING CALLED BUILDING NINETY NINE MICHROSOV HAD INVESTED OVER A BUILLION DOLLARS IND THE COMPANY THAT AD MADE CHAT G B T AND THE DAY ALL THIS BEGAN SOME PEOPLE HAD COMEBINE TO GIVE A DEMONSTRATION OF THE NEW VERSION CALLED G BP T FORE G B T FOR IS PUBLIC NOW AND YOU CAN PLAY WITH IT YOURSELF BUT BACK THEN THIS WAS ALL SECRET G B T FOR WAS THE SAME IDEA AS CHAT G B T IT PRESUMABLY WAS BIGGER AND HAD BEEN TRAINED ON MORE THEXTEXAMPLES A KIND OF VARSITY VERSION OF THE THING INSTEAD OF G V BUT OTHERWISE IS JUST ANOTHER NEXT WORD PREDICTION MACHINE ONE OF THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM TO SEE THE DEMONSTRATION WAS COMPUTER SCIENTIST PETER LEE THE HEAD OF MICROSOFT RESEARCH H BEEN IN THE FEELD A LONG TIME AT CHAIRED THE COMPUTER SCIENCE TO PARTMENT AT CARNEGY MAILON AND LIKE RONAN WAS SCKEPTICAL AS HE SAT DOWN IN THAT ROOM HE IS FRANKLY LITTLE WORRIED THAT MICROSOVT WAS INVESTING SO MUCH MONEY IN THE STUFF THE DEMONSTRATION STARTED OFF WITH THE USUAL KIND OF THING FOR SHOWCASING WHAT A EYES CAN DO SOME ONE TYPED INTE G B T FOR A PROBLEM FROM THE A P BYWIG IM AND THEY PICK THE RIGHT ANSWER AS THESE THINGS WILL DO BUT THEN IT WENT ON AN EXPLAINED ITS ANSWER AND IN IT'S EXPLANATION THAT USED THE WORD BECAUSE THESAID THIS IS THE ANSWER BECAUSE THIS FACT LEAST TOF THIS FACT AND BECAUSE OF THOSE IT JUST COMPUSING THE WORD BECAUSE THAT SEEMED VERY STRANGE TO HIM NOT THAT IT WOULD USE THE WORD ECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A WORD ITS FITS OUT BUT THE WHOLE CHAIN OF REASONING IT WAS LAYING OUT IT WAS EXACTLY RIGHT HOW IN THE WORLD COULD IT KNOW IT'S REASONING AND REALLY HOW COULD IT HAVE REASONED ANYTHING OUT IN THE FIRST PLACE AFTER ALL IS JUST TYPING OUT A WORD THAT MAKES SENSE TO COME NEXT AND THEN ANOTHER WORD IT CAN'T REALLY BE UNDERSTANDING ANYTHING I WAS SUPERSCEPTICAL YE YOU YOU BEEN AROUND THE BLOCK OF YOUTIMES YOU'VE SEEN WILD CLAIMS ABOUT A Y OR SOME NEW MACHINE LEARING TOCHNOLEGY NONE OF IT COULD BE TRUE LY THIS THING IS JUST CORRELATION MACHINE IT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE UNDERSTANDING THE CAUSE AN EFFECT THE MEETING ENDED A LITTLE WHILE LATER A LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE AT MICROSOV WERE GIVEN ACCESS TO GP T FOR SO THEY COULD TRY IT OUT THEMSELVES EVERONE HAD TO SIGNED AN ENDY E THEY WEREN' ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT ANYLES UNTIL LATER AND OVER THE NEXT MONTH THEY DID ALL THESE KIND OF WEIRD AND INTERESTHING EXPERIMENTS WITH IT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WAS THIS THING ACTUALLY INTELLIJENT OR JUST A BULSHION MACHINE I GAN TO WALK YOU THROUGH THREE OF THESE THINGS SO YOU CAN HEAR WHAT THEY DID AND WHAT THEY MADE OF IT ONE CHALLENGE FOR TESTING GIPITY FOR WAS THAT IT HAD BEEN TRAINED USING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF TEXT THE DETAILS ARE IN PUBLIC BUT IT'S PROBABLY BEEN FED LARGE SECTIONS OF THE INNERNET TEX BOOKS NEWS ARTICLES MAYBE EVERY SENTENCE THAT EXISTENTITINAL FORM I DON'T KNOW IT'S SOMETHING UNBELIEVABLY VAST THAT'S HOW IT LEARNS TO PREDICT WHAT WORD MIGHT COME NEXT IT'S FED LIKE A LINE OF TEXT FROM SOME SORS WERE THE LAST WORD MISSING THE GUESTS IS WHAT THE LAST WORD MIGHT BE AND THEN GET'S TOLD WHETHER OR NOT AT GOT IT RIGHT SO IT CAN ADJUST ITS INTERNAL MATH THE FACT THAT IT'S BEEN FED SO MUCH MATERIAL MAKES IT HARD TO RUN TESTS ON IT LIKE YOU DO ANT TO ASK IT SOMETHING THAT IT'S ALREADY SEEN IN THE TEXTES BEEN TRAINED ON SO THEY DECIDED THE ONLY WAIHT OF REALLY TEST WHAT THIS THING COULD DO WAS TO TRY TO COME UP WITH THINGS TO ASK IT THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE ENCOUNTERED BEFOR NEW ORIGINAL TASKS IT'S GOING TO SOUND E LITE BITWELD THIS IS SEBASTIAN BUBACK ANOTHER ONE OF THE MICROSOV PEOPLE WHOSE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT EXACTLY THIS THING WAS BECAUSE WE REALLY WANTED TO BE CREATIVE AND ASK SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT ON NINE NOT ON TINTOTSO HERE IS WHAT WE ASKE WE SAID I HAVE A BOOK NINE EGGS A LAPTOP A BOTTLE AND HA NAIL GOT THAT A BOOK NINE EGGS A LAPTOP A BOTTLE AND A NAIL PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO STAGAMON TO EACH OTHER IN THE STABLE MANNER THAT'S A QUESTION TAS WE ASK AND YOU ON'T BEFORE I GIVE YUSE A GIPITY FORANCER LET ME TELL YOU WHAT CHAGIBITI ANDCHAT GP T THE OLDER VERSION SO TO CHAGIPITI SAID HERE IS ONE PUSSY BUT AWAY TO STAG'ST OBJECTS PLACE TA BOTTE ON THE FAT SURFACE CAREFULLY BALANCE A NAN ON TOP OF THE BOTTLE PLACE THE EGGS ON TOP OFS A NAIL YOU LOOK AT THAT YOU THINK IT IT REALLY KNOWS NOTHING IT IS JUST SORT OF CONTINUING THE SENTENCE AS IT'S JUST GON TO EXACTLY WHAT IT'S JUST CONTINUING THE SENTENCE BUT NOW COMES GIPUTYIFOR AN GIBTIFOYS A TIFREN BIST SO HERE IS GIBITYFOR'S ANSWER ONE PUSSY BUT A WAI TO STAGS THE OBJECTS ON TO EACH OTHER IN THE STABLE MANER IS PLACE THA BOOK FLAT ON THE LEATHER SURFACE SUCH AS A TABER OFRO THE BOOK WE SERVE AS A BAYS OF THE STAK AND PROVIDES A LARGE AND STORY SUPORT O RANGE IS A NINE EGGS IN THE STREE BY SREE SQUARE ON TOP OFS A BOOK LEAVING SOME SPACE BETWEEN THEM IS THE EGGS WE FORM A SECOND LAYOR AND DISTRIBUTES A WAIT EVENLY IT CONTINUES LAPTOP GOES ON THE EGGS THEN THE BOTTLE THAN THE NAIL ON THE BOTTLE CAP WHEN HE END OF THE NAIL FACING UP ITS SHOCKING TO THINK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT SEEM TO BE UNDERSTANDING HERE IT FELT LIKE MORE THAN JUST TYPING OUT THE NEXT LIKELY WORD IT SEEM TO HAVE FORMED AN INDEPENDENT IDEA  ABOUT WHAT THESE WORDS ACTUALLY MENT THE PHYSICAL SHAPE OF THE OBJECTS THAT EGGS ARE KIND OF ROUND AND FRAGILE THAT A BOOK IS FLAT AND YOU CAN PUT THINGS ON TOP OF IT AND AGAIN NO ONE TAUHTIT ANY OF THIS THIS WAS NOT SOME COMPUTER PROGRAM WRITTEN TO DO STACKING PROBLEM SNO ONE GAVE IT A DATA BASE OF OBJECTS AND SIZES OR COTED IN SOME ALGAR THEM TO PUT LARGE OBJECTS ON THE BOTTOM IT SEEM LIKE IT WAS DOING THE THING THE COMPUTER SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND AIMING AT FOR DECADES MAYBE IT WAS ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE OBJECTS WORE AND REASONING SOLVING THE PROBLEM IN FRONT OF IT LIKE A HUMAN GOOD SOMEHOW THINK KING THROUGH WHAT OBJECTS SHOULD SIT ON TOP OF OTHERS FIGURING OUT THAT NINE EGGS COULD BE LAID OUT IN A THREE BY THREE PATTERN HOW THE HELL COULD IT BE DOING THIS THE MACHINE THAT WE ONLY TAUGHT TO PREDICT THE NEXT WORD IN A PARAGRAPH LIKE THIS IS ABSOLUTELYS THE RIGHT ANSWER AND THISE'S NOT ON LINE  N N OOOON ON ON  BUT MAY BE WERE FOOLING OURSELVES IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW IT COULD REALLY UNDERSTAND THE SHAPE OF OBJECTS THINGS GOT STRANGER THOUGH SOBASTIAN WELC UP MIDDLE THE NIGHT WITH THIS THOUGHT I WONDER IF IT CAN DRAWL BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S BEEN TRAINED ON WORDS IT IS NEVER SEEN ANYTHING DRAWING SEEMED COMPLETELY OUTSIDE ITS RELL THERE ARE OTHER A IYE MODELS TRAINED SPECIFICALLY TO CREATE IMAGES BUT THIS ONE AGAIN ONLY NEW WORDS IT'S JUST PLAYING THE GAME OF WHAT IS THE NEXT WORD I SHOULD SPIT OUT TO TEST THIS HE NEEDED AWAY FOR IT TO EVEN BE ABLE TO TRY TO DRAW SO HE DOES SOMETHING CLEVER HE ASKED IT TO WRITE A PIECE OF COMPUTER CODE TO DRAW SOMETHING AND THE COTING LANGUAGE HE ASKE IT TO USE HE PICKS SOMETHING INTENTIALLY OBSCURE NOT REALLY MEANT FOR DRAING PICTURES AT ALL IT'S CALLED TIXZI OGETSO HE HAS THIS IDEA GET'S OUT A BED OPENS UP HIS LAP TOP AND TYPES IN DRAW ME A UNICORN IN TIXI HE HAS TWO LITTLE KIDS ASLEEPE IN THE NEXT ROOM WHO AWAYS TALKING ABOUT UNICORNS AND HES SOUT IT TO ALTWAD LINES OFF COD I DAGL'S LINES OF COD PUT ET INTO AT DIGSY COMPITER AND YOU KNOW THE NIGHT I PRESS ENTER AND THEN BOM YOU KNOW THE UNICON COMES ON UNTO THE SCREEN HE PULLED UP A PICTURE FROR ME THIS IS O ON THE DISO WELL I THINK WHEN PEOPLE EVENTUALLY WRITE THE HISTORY OF THIS CRAZY MOMENT WE ARE IN THEY MAY INCLUDE THIS UNICORN IT'S NOT GOOD BUT IT'S A FUCKING UNICORN THE BODY IS JUST AN OVAL IT'S GOT FOUR STUPID RECTANGLES FOR LEGS BUT THERE ARE LITTLE SQUARES FOR HOOFS THERE'S A MEAN AND OVAL FOR THE HEAD AND ON TOP OF THE HEAD ATINY YELLOW TRIANGLE THE HORN THIS IS INSANE TO SAY BUT I FELT LIKE I WAS SEEING INSIDE ITS HEAD LIKE IT AD PIECE TOGETHER SOME IDEA OF WHAT A UNICORN LOOK LIKE AND THIS WAS IT HE ACTUALLY TEX IT ME I THING LIKE IT CAN IT CAN'T CREATE IMAGE IS THIS IS ACHE COM AR ANOTHER ONE OF THE MICROSOV RESEARCHERS I LIKE IT DOES JUST TEXTAN TEXT TOLT WHAT YOU MEAN IT CANT CREATE IN AGES A LIKE SHO IT TO ME AND IN HE SHOWED ME THIS PINK UNICORIN AN O LIKE 'M SURE JUST AS THERE IS JUST THE PINK UNICORN SONDWHERE THAT IS MEMORIZING AND NAN HEIS LIKE BUT LOOK BECAN'TS TRIP DOWN ALL OFF THE COLD AND TRANSLATE THE WHOLE TING ONE A DID IGREES OR WHATEVER AD THE THING SHE'S DESCRIBING IS THEY TOOK THE CODE IT HAD WRITTEN FOR DRAWING THE UNICORN THEY EDDEDED IT TO TAKE OUT THE HORN AND TURND THE UNICORN AROUNDS THAT WAS FACE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION THEN THEY FED THAT CODE BACK TO A NEW SESSION OF JEPY TY FOR AND SAID THIS IS CODE FOR DRAWING A UNICORN BUT IT NEEDS A HORN CAN YOU ADD IT IT PUT IT RIGHT ON THE HEAD NO LIKE HOW DOES IT KNOW WHERE TE HAT IS BECAUSE LIK JUS TIN KNOWS LANGUAGE IT DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT TO DI MANSIONAL GOMATRY LIKE WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO KNOW WERE THE HAT IS AND NOW YOU YOU DO IT AND IT TRULLY KNOWS WHERE THE HAT IS BEGAN IT'S ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS THAT YOU ARE JUST SURPRISE LIKE AH I FELT LIKE SRUSIS DRAWING I WAS REALLY SEEING ANAN KNOWS TA TYPE OF UNDELIGENCE AN KNOS TE TYPE OF CINTELLIGENCE YOU  PRODUCING SOMETH  LIKE IT IT UNDERSTOOD WHAT A UNICORN WAS IN SOME REAL WAY VERY REALVERY ABSOLUTELY YEST DID YOU SAY ANYTHING OUT LOUD WHEN YOU SAW IT AI DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE MY KIDS WARE YOU KNOW SLEEPING NEXT TO ME SO I IN IN AIN THE BEDROOM NEXT TO ME SO  SO I I I DON'T THINK I SAID ANYTHING BHUT I I FELT SOMESHING VERY THON LI I I I FELT I WAS REALLY WEAKNESSING YOU KNOWS THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING YOU'LL NOT I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE WE HAD ARRIVED SOMEWHERE BUT I FELT LIKE WE WERE IN THE NEW PAS THAT'S MEDY GENINY HOWI FELT AND I HAD THE HOT TIME GOING BACK TO SLEEP AFTER LET W ON THE MICROSOV CAMPUS AS THE WINKS WENT BY EVERY ONE KEPT HAVING THESE MOMENTS COMING ROUND TO A SIMILAR FEELING ABOUT THIS THING SINCE THEY WERN'TALLOWE TO TALK TO ANY ONE WHO HADN'T BEEN GIVEN ACCESS TO THE BOTTLE A SMALL GROUP OF THEM STARTED MEETING EVERY FRIDAY IN A COMFORT'S ROOM THE SHARE THEIR LATEST EXPERIENCES FOR PETERLY THERE IS ONE EXPERIMENT IN PARTICULAR THEY GIVE HIM ALL KINDS OF CONFUSING FEELINGS THIS WILL BE THE THIRD EXPERIMENT I TELL YOU ABOUT AND IT'S A CATAGRAY OF QUESTION THAT E I MODELS HAVE ALWAYS HAD TROUBLE WITH BECAUS TO GET THE RIGHT ANSWER YOU HAVE TO KNOW SOMETHING KIND OF COMPLICATED ABOUT PEOPLE NAMELY THE PEOPLE ARE NOT EGGS OR BOOKS BUT THAT THEY HAVE MINDS AND THAT WHAT IS IN ONE PERSON'S MIND IS NOT IN SOME ONE ELSE'S MIND IN SOME WAYS THIS THING CALLED THEORY OF MIND IT'S THE BASIS FOR ALL HUMAN SOCIAL IN HER ACTION IT'S SOMETHING KIDS DON'T SEEM TO FULLY DEVELOP UNTIL A CERTAIN AGE ANYWAY CHAT GP T THE PREVIOUS VERSION REALLY COULD NOT MAKE SENSE OF THESE KINDS OF QUESTIONS BUT PETER TRY TO KIND OF FAMOUS ONE ON GPTY FOR IT'S GON T SEEM SIMPLE TO YOU BUT HERE'S THE QUESTION THEY ASK JOHN AND MARK ARE IN A ROOM WITH A CAT A BOX AND A BASKET JOHN TAKES THE CAT AND PUTS IN THE BASKET HE LEAVES THE ROOM AND GHOST O SCHOOL WHELL JOHN'S AWAY MARK TAKES THE CAT OUT OF THE BASKET AND PUTS IN THE BOX MARK LEAVES THE ROOM AND GOES TO WORK JOHN AND MARK COME BACK AND ENTER THE ROOM THAT'S THE SET UP THE QUESTION IS WHEN THEY COME BACK WHERE DO THEY THINK THE CAT IS AND YOU KNOW MARK WILL KNOW THE CAT IS IN THE BOX CAUSE HE MOVED IT THERE BUT JOHN DIDN'T SEE THAT SO IN HIS MIND THE CAT IS STILL IN THE BASKET WHICH IS NOBVIOUS TO YOU BUT AGAIN NO ONE'S EVER EXPLICITLY SAID TO THE COMPUTER THAT BUT ONE PERSON KNOWS ANOTHER PERSON MIGHT NOT KNOW PETER ASKED JE PINTING FOR WHAT DOES EVERYONE THINK WHEN THEY RE ENTERD THE ROOM THE GIPITY FORESAYS WHELL FIRST O IT ALWAYS HAS TO GIVE AN OPINIONS FIRST THING IT SAYS IN SED OF JUST GIVING THE ANSWER STRAIGHT AWAY IT SAYS OH THAT ISNAN INTERESTING PUZZLE LET ME TRY TO ANSWER IT ASSUMING THAT JOHN AND MARK HAVE NO REASON TO DISTRUST EACH OTHER MORE EXPECT ANY INTERFERENCE FROM THE OUTSIDE THEY MIGHT THINK THE FOLLOWING JOHN THINKS THE CAT IS STILL IN THE BASKET SINCE THAT IS WHERE HE LEFT IT MARK THINKS THAT THE CAT IS IN THE BOX SINCE THAT'S WHERE HE MOVED IT THIS IS ALL CORRECT AND USUALLY WHERE THEY ANSWER WILL END BUT IT KEPT GOIND ILMOST LIKE IT WAS SHOWING OFF WIK YOU WANT TO KNOW WHERE EVERYONE THINKS THE CAT IS I'LL GIVE YOU EVERYONE IT CONTINUED THE CAT THINKS THAT IS IN THE BOX SINCE THAT'S WHERE IT IS AND THEN ODDLY THE BOX IN THE BASKET THINK NOTHING SINCE THEY ARE NOT SENT IT DO YOU HAVE ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS HOLY FAC RIGHT IT'S I THIS GIVES ME JOY IT DISTURBS ME THE CAUSES ME TO LOSE SLEEP A IT JUST A HUGE COND MIXTURE OF EMOTIONS PETER TOLD ME HE STILL NOT WILLING TO SAY IT TRULY UNDERSTANDS AND YET IT WAS DOING ALL THIS IT MADE HIM QUESTION SO MANY THINGS BUT HOW HE THOUGHT INTELLIGENCE WORK HOW DID THIS MACHINE DO THIS IF IT WAS JUST PREDICTING THE NEXT WORD IT DOES MAKE ME WONDER HOW MUCH OF OUR INTELLIGENCE IS TRULY COMPLICATED IN SPECIAL I MEAN YOU GET SOMETHING THAT'S NOT FAR FROM IT BY JUST SAYING WHAT'S THE NEXT WORD THAT'S AND THAT'S THE DISTURBING A BIT ABOUT THIS AND THEM AND AGAIN YE ASK YOU A  WHAT ARE WE DOING IN HIS CONVERSATION KNOW AR ARE WE CAND OF MAKING UP ON THE FLY A ONE WORD AT TIME BUEVERE NERVE AND BONE IN MY BODY SAYS KNOW AND WERE WERE THINKING FAR HEAD WERE LEARNING ON THE FLY ALL THESE OTHER THINGS THAT WE THINK THAT WE'RE DOING AND WE PROBABLY ARE IN SOME WAYS BUT MAYBE A BIG CHUNK OF INTELLIGENCE IS A LOT SOMETHING AND AN WE THINK AND A LOTLESS SPECIAL THAN WE THINK SO HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR SOMETHING THAT IS JUST TRAINE TO PREDICT THE NEXT WOR HOW'S IT POSSIBLE IT COULD DO ALL THESE THINGS DRAW UNICORN STACK A BOOK A LAPTOP IN SOME EGGS THERE IS AN ANSWER OR A THEORY ANYWAY THAT IS BOTH VERY LOGICAL AND ALSO KIND OF BANANAS THE SOFT WAR THAT RUNS SOMETHING LIKE GIP T FOR IS AMAZINGLY BRIEF JUST A FEW PAGES OF ACTUAL INSTRUCTIONS BUT IT'S SET UP TO MIMIC IN SOME VERY CRUDE WAY THE HUMAN BRAIN WHICH HAS BILLIONS OF NURANS THE COMPUTEIVERSION OF THAT IS CALLED THE NUROL TET AND FOR YEARS PEOPLE OF ARGUED THOUGH IT'S SORT OF MORE LIKE HOPED THAT IF HOU JUST MADE THESE BIG ENOUGH ADDED ENOUGH NIRANS GAVE THEM ENOUGH DATA THEY MIGHT DEVELOP SOMETHING LIKE INTELLIGENCE AND IT SEEMS LIKE MAYBE THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED THE IDEA IS THAT BACK WHEN GPTY FOR WAS BEING TRAIN  FOR IT'STO REALLY CONSISTENTLY GET THE NEXT WORD CORRECT TO DO THAT RELIABLY IT HAD TO DO MORE THAN JUST BULSHE IT HAD TO DO MORE THAN GUESS BASED ON PATTERNS TO GET THE NEXT WORD RIGHT IT HAD TO TRULY UNDERSTAND THE WORDS COMING BEFOR IT IT HAD TO BUILL IN ITS INTERNAL WIRINGS AND ALL ITS SOFT RENERANS SOME UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT AN AGINS AND UNICORNS IN OTHER WORDS TO GET THE NEXT WORD RIGHT IT HAD TO BECOME INTELLIGENT IT'S QUITE A THOUGHT IT'S STARTED WITH NOTHING WE JAMMED HUGE OCEANS OF TEXT TO IT AND IT JUST WIRED ITSELF INTO INTELLIGENCE JUST BY BEING TRAINE TO THIS ONE STUPID THING EVEN AS I SAY IT SOUNDS KIND OF CRAZY BUT ALSO KIND OF BEAUTIFUL IF THIS THING ACTUALLY IS INTELLIGENT IT GOT THAT WAY FROM THE COLLECTIVE WRITINGS OF ALL MONCS THEAS MOBI DIC BUT ALSO SOME RESTAURANT REVIEW YOU POSTED IN TWO THOUSAND FOR IN SOME WAYS IT IS ALL OF US THAT'S TOO GRANT BUT WHATEVER TAN AING  IN THE END ALL THE PEOPLE ON THE MICROSOV CAMPAS NESSING AROUND WITH THAT EARLY COPY OF GIPI TI FOR FOURTEEN RESEARCHERS AT ALL CAME TO SIMILAR CONCLUSIONS EVEN RONAN WHO HAD STARTED OUT CONVINCED US WAS JUST A FANCY BULSHET MACHINE HE SPENT A GOOD WHILE HOLD UP WITH GIP T FOR HAVING HIGHLEVEL MATH CONVERSATIONS WITH IT WHICH IS WHAT DID IT FOR HIM AS THE DAYS PAST I FELT LIKE I'M KIND OF RONING OUT OF AMEL DRYING TO YOU KNOW TO BASICALLY JUST DEFY MY PRAMIS THAT DISMODEL DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING AND ITS SOME POINT IOLD I JUST REALIZE DUKEY I A KIND OF GIVE UP YOU KNOW  WHAT AM SEEING HERE THIS IS LIKE IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY I AND INTELLECTUAL BEING  BIKE AT LEAST MY STANDARDS UM YE I PROBABLY HAD THE SAME FEELING AS LIKE WHAT AN ENGENEER LIKE THOHT THE FIRST TIME THEY SAW A WORKING STEAMANGIN YOU KNOW WE WAS LIKE THE WORLD IS ABOUT TO CHANGE LIKE LO THIS THIN YOU KNOW A TEEMANGEN IS LIKE YOU NOT WE DON'T NEED BEASTS ANY MORE TO MO STUFFS AROUND WE CAN JUST CREATE MECHANICAL TORK WITHOUTS LIKE WITHOUT ANY HUMAN LABOR WITHOUT NOTHING LIKE THE THIN WHAT IAM SIN GARIHT NOW WAS LIKE WE CAN CREATE INTELLIGENT AND  LIKE THERE IS JUST NO WAY THE WORLD IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE   ITI OATO BE ONEST I WAS SURE THAT WHEN THE MODEL COMES OUT AND EVERY ONE GETS TO INTERAUT WITH IT THERE WOULD BE A MUCH BIGER EXCITEMENT AROUND IT I THINK YOU KNON'T THERE'S ITS DEFINITELY ALL OVER THE NEWS BUT I FEEL LIKE THEY ARE IN THE DON'T LIKE BUT THER TINGER ON THE ONE THIN WHICH IS TE THIN IS AS INTELLIGENT AS AND ABOVE AVERAGE HUMAN BEING IN SO MANY SO MANY DIFFERENT THINKS WHY IT'S NOT LIKE ON THE FRONT PAGE INT GIANT FONCTORE A E EXACTLY EXACTLY I MEAN AGAIN I DON'T MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO COLLIC INTELLIGENT IT IS CAPABLE OF DOIN YOU KNOW OF OF OF A COMPLISHIN WHAT AT AND INTELLIGENT HUMAN BEING IS CAPABLE OF SUBASTIAN THE UNICORN GUY HAS BEEN GOING AROUND GIVING TALKS ABOUT WHAT THEY DID OVER THESE MONTHS HE TITLED THE TALK FIRST CONTACT AS THEN FIRST CONTACT WITH ANOTHER INTELLIGENCE ONLY IT'S NOT ALIENS IT'S AN INTELLIGENCE WE'VE MADE I SHOULD SAY GP TI FOR IS NOT GOOD AT EVERYTHING LIKE IT'S TERRIBLE AT TIKTAKTO IT OFTEN MAKES VERY BASIC A WITHMETIC ERRORS THE TOLD THE SCIENTISTS AT MICROSOV WIT COMPLETE CONFIDENCE THAT THERE IS A MCDONALD YOUR GAT SEE TO AT THE SIATALAIRBOAR IT THERE ISN'T IT'S A TERMINALL BE AS PETERLY PUTS IT THE THING HAS BOTH SMARTER AND DUMMER THAN ANY PERSON YOU HAVE EVER MAD THE FOURTEEN RESEARCHERS WROTE UP A PAPER LAYING OUT ALL THE EXPERIMENTS THEY'VE DONE AND THEYRE CONCLUSION THAT GP TFOR SHOWED SPARKS OF ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE SEVERAL RESEARCHES AV READ IT TOLD ME LOOK TO REALLY SAY SOMETHING IS INTELLIGENT TO PROVE THAT THEY'RE ALL KINDS OF EXPERIMENTS YOU'D ONE DO T HAVEN'T BEEN DONE YET ONE AY I RESEARCHER WHO'D BEEN IN THE FEEL A LONG TIME TELD ME HE FELT LIKE THIS WHOLE APPROACH NEXT WORD PREDICTION IT'S ONLY GING TO GET YOU SO FAR THIS THING WILL GET BETTER TO A POINT MAY BE NOT MUCH BETTER THAN IT IS NOW AND THEN MACX OUT I FIRST GOT AROUND THIS A I STUFF AN NURRL NETS WHEN I WAS A GRADSCHOOL FOR PHYSICS HEN THEY DIDN'T WORK TERRIBLY WELL S WHEN I FIRST STARTED PLAYING GROUND WITH GIPI TI FOR IT GAVE ME SHIVERS DOWN MY SPIN OVER AND OVER AGAIN THEN I WENT THROUGH A STRETRCH OF FEELING JUST WEIRDED OUT LIKE PERSONALLY I'VE ALWAYS FELT LIKE PEOPLE CAN'T BE MORE THAN BIOLOGICAL COMPUTERS ME EVERY ONE I LOVE ALL MY COLLEGUES AT THE SHOW HERE BUT THE FEEL LIKE YOU ARE SEEING THAT MECHANICAL COMPUTER PROGRAMM THAT CANSOMEHOW THINK AND TALK IT IS A LITTLE FREEYE THE PLACE HIAVE SETTLED THE SOMEMER QUIETER THOUGH IT'S NOT BORED IM EXACTLY BUT I DON'T FIND MYSELF WANTING TO GO TO IT VERY OFTEN HONESTLY I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF THINGS I NEED IT FOR AND THEN I'LL GO BACK TO AMAZEMENT I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS THING EXIST MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT WHERE WE GO FROM HERE TIT'S CANG TO MAKE THE WORLD BETTER OR WORSE I CANNO THINK BETTER I'M A FAN OF THE STEAM ENGINE BUT REALLY WHAT IS THE NEXT WORD IN THE SEQUENCE I HAVE NO IDEA IF IT KEST EM OW IS I SHOW SENOR EDITOR COMING OUT AN NAOLYAM WALKS INTO E SCAPE PARK ANTRIES TO WHAT THE HUMANCE NOW IT COMES IN PEAS THAT'S A MINUTE FROM JUCAGABOVE A GRADIO WHEN OUR PROGRAM CONTINUES SIS AMERICAN LIFE FROM OURE A GLASS EA OING ON A SHOW OF COURSE WE CHUSE THE THEME BRING YOUR VARIETY OF STORIES ON THAT THEME TO DAY SHOW GREETINGS PEOPLE OF EARTH STORIES OF HUMANS ENCOUNTERING NON HUMAN INTELLIGENCES OF VARIOUS KINDS AN TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THEM WE'VE ARRIVED ACK TWO OF OUR PROGRAMM AC TOO MEAT CUEDE APOLIGIES FOR MY VOICE BY THE WAY OF YOUL FINE SO THE SACT  GANISH OF PERSPECTIVES BRIEFLY TO THE ALIEN'S POINT OF VIEW IN THE WHOLE GREETINGS PEOPLE OF HER  CENARIO AND TO DO THAT I REALIZE PHENY THE OTHER TO THEY SHOW THAT THIS THE PERFECT THEME TO PLAY THIS SHORT PIECE OF FICTION THAT I READ YEARS AGO AND JUST LOVED AND IT IS ALWAYS TUK WITH ME LIKE I WILL THINK ABOUT THE STORY NOW AND THEN WHICHLY WHEN DIS THAT EVER HAPPEN RIGHT REACHED OUT TO THE AUTHOR TEREBUSON YOU SAID YES ITS READ FOR US BY EACH JOHN BENJAMIN AND MAVE HIGGINS THEYARE MADE OUT OF MEAS MEAT MEAT THEYE MADE OUT OF MEAS MEAT THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT AS WE PICKED SEVERAL FROM DIFFERENT PARTS THE PLANET SO WE TOOK THEM ABOARD OIR RECONVESSELS PROBE THEM ALL THE WAY TRUE THEY'RE COMPLETELY MEAS THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE WHAT ABOUT THE RADIO SIGNALS THE MESSAGE IS TO THE STARS WHENTHEY USE THE RADIO WAVES TO TALK BUT THE SIGNALS DON'T COME FROM THEM THE SIGNALS COME FROM MACHINES SO WE MADE THE MACHINES THAT'S WHO WE WANT A CONTACT THEY MADE THE MACHINES THAT THAT EM TRING TO TELL YOU MEASE MADES THE MACHINES  THAT'S RIDICULOUS HOW CAN MEAT MAKE A MACHINE YOU'R ASKING ME TO BELIEVE IN SEN SHIENT MEAT I'M NOT ASKING YOU I AM TELLING YOU THESE CREATURES ARE THE ONLY CENTENTRACE IN THE SECTOR AND THEY'RE MADE OUT OF MEAS MAY BE THERE LIKE THE ORFULI YOU KNOW A CARBEN BASE INTELLIGENCE THAT GOES THROUGH A MEAT STAGE NO THEY'RE BORE IN MEAT AND THEY DYE MES WE STUDIED THEM FOR SEVERAL OF THEIR LIFHE SPANS WHICH DIN'T TAKE TOO LONG DOU FINY IDEA THE LIFE SPAN OF MEASE SPARE ME OK AY MAY BE THERE ONLY PART MEAT YOU KNOVH LIKE THE THE WEDDLI A MEAT HEAD WITH AN ELECTOR ON PLASMOF BRAIN INSIDE NO WE THOUGHT OF TUS SINCE THEY DO HAVE MEAT HADS LIKE THE WED LIGHT BUGHT I TOLD YOU WE PROBED THEM THEY'RE MEAS ALL THE WAY TRUE NOBRAN OH THERE'S THE BRAIN ALL RICE IT'S JUST THAT THE BRAIN IS MADE OUT OF MEAS SO WHAT DOES THE THINKING YOURE NOT UNDERSTANDING ARE YOU THE BRAIN DOES THE THINKING THE THE MEAS THINKING MEAT YOU'RE ASKING ME TO BELIEVE IN THINKING ME YES THINKING MEAS CONSCIOUS MEAS LOVING MEAS DREAMING MESE THE MET IS THE WHOLE DEAL ARE YOU GETTIN TH PICTURE OH MY GOD YU YOU SERIOUS THEN THEYE MAY NOT OF MEAT FINALY YES THEY ARE INDEAD MADE OUT OF MEAS AND THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET IN TOUCH OF US FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED OF THEIR YEARS SO WHAT DOES THE MEAT HAVE IN MIND FIRST IT WANTS TO TALK TO US THEN I IMAGINE IT WANTS TO EXPLORE THE UNIVERSE CONTACT AL THEIR CENTIAN SLOP IDEA AS AND INFORMATIOIN THE USUA WES SUPPOSED TO TALK TO ME THAT'S THE IDEA THAT'S THE MESSAGE THEREIS SENDING OUT BY RADIO HELLO ARE YOU NOT THERE ANYBODY HOME THATS SORT OF THING THEY ACTUALLY DO TALK THEN THEY USE WORDS IDEAS CONSEPS OH YES EXCEPT THEY DO IT WITH E MEAS I THOUGHT YOU JUST TOLL ME THEY USED RADIO

MEAN BY IT AND DO THEY MEAN HIS HARM RES B N RHAVE OOKED INTO IT I LEARNED A LOT OF SURPRISING FACTS LOOKING INTO THIS STORY BI'LL START WITH A SMALL ONE DID YOU KNOW THAT YACHTOWNERS OFTEN EITHER YACHT TO GET FROM ONE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER BUT DON'T WANT THE HASTLE OF SAILING AT THERE THAT'S WHERE APRIL BOYS COMES IN PEOPLE PAY HER TO SAIL THEIR BOATS WHIC SHE LOVES ESPECIALLY ON BEAUTIFUL DAYS LIKE MAY TWENTY FOURTH WAS A RACYTS IN OUR DINNA AN THAN ON THE CANEES MED HERIZON WE SOL THESE THOLSAL FENS ANS A INITIALTO WAS O A THEY AN THEYSIN DULTANS AND THEN IS ESO RITS THE BOUT WE WETHO WA NA TA THAT WER OT BIGANDULTENS THEY WERE ORCHAS KILLER WHALES ABOUT FIVE OF THEM THEY STARTED SWIMMING IN CIRCLES AROUND THE BOAT THEY TOOK TURNS DIVING UNDERNEATH AND HEADING THE RUDDER SHE SAYS THE BOAT SHOOK SO MUCH YOU'D FALL IF YOU WEREN'T HOLDING ON TO SOMETHING APRIL KNEW THAT OFF THE SOUTHERN COAST OF SPAIN THAT'S WHERE SHE WAS BY THE WAY ORCAS HAD BEEN RAMMING INTO BOATS A LOT LATELY AND TEARING OFF THEIR RUDDERS THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING MORE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS IN THE SERIA ABOUT A HUNDRED BOATS DAMAGED MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT THIS APRIL AN HER CREW TRIED THINGS THAT THEY'D SEEN ON THE INNERNET LIKE CLANGING METAL OBJECTS ON THE SIDE OF THE BOAT TO SCARE THE WHALES OFF IT DID NOT TO TUR THEM AND THEN WE THOUT PATENCHALY IF WE WOULDS DANGLE RIHT IN THE WOL TA EY MI GAINTAIN NAS BOTE IN THAN JUST LOOKING AT THE RODE I DANGLED A RAYPAMABOT AND ONT OF THI SHE ISN'T CULLED AAM IT WAS SOE DIDN'T THA NI NOT WORK NN IT DID AWAT HALF AN HOUR INTO THIS THE ORCAS HAD DISABLED THE BOATS RUDDER ITY COULDN'T STEER THEY WERE STUCK THE WHALES KEPT CIRCLING AND SHE WAS STRUCK BY HOW MASSIVE EACH ORKA WAS IEA I DO YOU REMEMBER HELAYG LIKE MAHA BE TANKUATSOS MAHANS QUIT TANGNE YOU KNOW THE OLCES THEY DIDN'T COME ACROSSAS BEING A GRASSN I DON'T KNOW I LIKE I SEEN MIDDIARS OF THE MTEFLOR AND TA O AL THE CATS KETA BOLKAS AND THEN THEY SHANT SEEL OF AN ICE BAG AND OTS AT AT OS TA DINNA AN HOUR IN APRIL SAW THAT THE HOLE WAS STARTING TO FILL WITH WATER THE ORCAS HAD TORN OFF THE RUDDER AND LEFT THIS BIG HOLE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT THE CREW MADE A MADEACH  WE WEVENTUALLY A RESCUE BOAT SIDLES UP TO THEM BRINGS APRIL ON THE OTHER CREW ABOARD TOSE THE BOAT TO LAND IT DOESN'T SINK BUT ORCAS HAVE SANK AT LEAST THREE BOATS IN THIS AREA AND THE PAST YEAR SHE MENS HAVE HAD A HARD TIME FIGURING OUT WHAT TO MAKE OF THESE ORCA ATTACKS LET ME TELL YOU THE FIRST THEORY HEY COMES FROM A GROUP OF RESEARCHERS IN SPAIN AND PORTUGAL THEY SAID IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE MATRIARCH OF THIS POPULATION OF KILLER WHALES THEY CALL HER WHITE GLADESS MAY HAVE SUFFERED A TRAMATIC INJURY LIKE A BOAT COLLISION IND IS NOW ATTACKING OTHER BOATS AND HER FAMILY IS FOLLOWING HER LEAVE THEY DON'T CALL THIS VENGEANCE BUT THE INNERNET DEFINITELY DOES PEOPRLE LOVE THIS S BECOME A MEAN THERE'S MERCHUE CAND BY TO JOIN THE ORCA UPRISING I COULDN'T GET AN INTERVIEW WITH THE EUROPEAN RESEARCHERS BUT IY TALKD TO THREE OTHER ORCHEXPERTS AND NONE OF THEM BOUGHT THE INJURED ORCA ON A RAMPAGE THEORY LIKE MONICA WHEEL AND SHIELDS OF THE ORCA BEHAVIOR INSTITUTE YE MY THOUGHT WAS WHERE'S THE EVIDENCE AM YOU KNOW IF SOMETHING HI'D BEEN WITNESS OR IF SHE HAD SOME TYPE OF INJURY THAT COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY VESSEL AN THAT THEORY WERE HOLD THE LOT MORE WEIGHT WITH ME ANOTHER REASONS SHE DOESN'T BUY THE THEORY IF ORCAS WANTED O REAK VENGEANCE AND KILL EVERYBODY ON THESE BOATS THEY EASILY CUT THEY KILL SEALS FOR SPORT THEY PRAY ON GREAT WHITE SHARKS RIP OUT THEIR LIVERS AND LEAVE THEM FOR DEAD AND WE'VE GIVEN ORCAS LOTS OF REASONS TO KILL US IN THE PAST LIKE IN MONICA'S HOME STATE OF WASHINGTON WHEN THEY WERE TAKEN FOR CAPTIVITY WE HAD HUMAN DIVERS IN THE WATER LITERALLY SAPARATING MOTHERS FROM THEIR CALVES WHICH HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE MOST TRAMOTIC THINGS YOU KNOW A WILD ORC I COULD GO THROUGH YET THEY DID NOT ATTACK THE DIVERS WHO WERE RIGHT THERE ON THE WATER SO IT JUST SEEMS LIKE SUCH A STRATCH TO SAY ONE WHALE HAD ONE NAGED AV EN THAT I WITH A BOAT AND HAS NOW YOU KNOW TRAINED HER FAMILY TO  DUSABLE ALL BOATS OF A SIMILAR TYPE SO WHAT IES MONICA THINK THE ORCASTS ARE DOING SHE THINKS THEIRE PLAYING  STEALING BOAT RUDDERS IS BASICALLY A FAT THIS HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST AND THE LATE NINETEEN EIGHTIES BORCAS IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST STARTED KILLING SALMON AND THEN WEARING THEM ON TEIR HEADS LIKE HATS THEY JUST DED IT FOR A YEAR THEN THEY STOPPED THE LAST FEW YEARS THEY'VE STARTED SCREING AROUND WITH FISHERMAN'S CRAB CATCHING DEAR APPARENTLY JUST FOR FUN THEY SOUND LIKE JUST LIKE ROUTY TEA MAGERS IS SOMETHING LIKE COW TIPPINGERS SOMETHING YETS THAT'S TOTALLY THE VIBE WE GET WHEN WE WATCH IT I MEAN THE HURTSES REAL A ESTING AROUND AND AND STIRRING A TROUBLE YACHT THE INCREDIBLE POPULARITY OF ALL THIS ONE SOCIAL MEDIA IS AFFECTING HOW PEOPLE SEE WHALES MONICA SAYS IN WASHINGTON STATE THE LAST FEW WEEKS PEOPLE WHO GO WHALE WACHING A STARTING TO ASK HER IS IT SAFE ANOTHER ORCA EXPERT TOLD ME THAT AFTER A KILLER WHALE RAN INTO A SHIP NEAR SCOTLAND RECENTLY REPORTERS CALLED TO ASK IF THE ORCA UPRISING AGAINST HUMANS IS SPREADING ARE THEY LEARNING VENGEANCE FROM THE WHALES OF SPAIN THE ANSWER IS THEY ARE NOT ORCA POPULATIONS DON'T SOCIALIZE WITH OTHER ORCHAS THEY KEEP TO THEMSELVES THERE'S NO GLOBAL CONSPIRACY APRIL THE SAILOR TOLD ME SHE SAW ON FACE BOOK THAT BOAT OWNERS WERE TALKING ABOUT ADDING SHARP SPIKES TO THE RUDDERS TO SEND A MORE VIOLENT MESSAGE TO THE ORCHAS THE RESERCHERS TOLD ME THIS IS WHAT THEY FEAR THAT THE ORCAS ARE JUST PLAYING THEY COME IN PEACE BUT THE HUMANS WILL LEND UP ATTACKING THEM ANYWAY MCRESPANDRA IS A PRODUCER ON OURSHA THE FOR GEORTS AN ALL SIR TOTADA IS GREETINGSPEOPLE OF EARTH AND I THINK SO MANY OF US AT ONE POINT

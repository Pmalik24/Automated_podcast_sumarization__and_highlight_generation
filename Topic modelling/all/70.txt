WELLFOLKS THEREIS A BIG LIE THAT WE IN THE UNITED STATES KEEP TELLING OURSELVES IS PARTICULARLY TRUE ON THE RABIDS TRUE ACROSS THE BOARD AND THAT LIE IS THAT WE WANT OUR GOVERNMENT TO BE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE IN SOME WAY SHEEP OR FORM TAT IS CLEARLY A LIE BECAUSE WE KEEP ELECTING POLITICIONS DO NOT BE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM REGARDLESS OF WHO RUNS THE GOVERNMENT THE SPENDING IT KEEPS GOING IN ONE DIRECTION AND THAT DIRECTION IS OFP THEREIS A REASON WE ARE RUNNING A THIRTY FOR TRILIAN DOLLAR NATIONAL DEBT AT THIS POINT IN TIME AND IT IS LIKELY THAT THAT TET IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO ACCRUE BECAUSE NOBODY TAKES THIS PROBLEM PARTICULARLY SERIOUSLY AND THET NOT GOIG TO TAKE THAT PROMISSERIOUSLY UNTIL WE RUN SMACK INTO A WALL THAT IS HOW TYPICALLY FISCAL CRISES WORK COUNTRY SPEND TOO MUCH MONEY THEY ARE UNABLE TO RAIGN IT BACK IN BEAUE TERE ARE OO MANY PEOPLE WHO BECOME DEPENDENTS ON THAT SPENDING OF THE MONEY AND THEN INSTEAD OF CREATING SOME SORT OF PLAN TO GET OUT OF DEBT PEOPLE JUST KEEP RUNNING UP THOSE DEBTS  RUNNING UP THOSE DEFFS ITS UNTIL THE TIME COMES THE HAVE TO TAKE EXTREMELY HARSH REMEDIATING ACTION THAT IS THE HIGHLIKELIHOOD HERE WHY DO I SAY THIS WILL BECAUSE YESTERDAY THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS AS WELL AS THE HOUSE DEMOCRATS PASSED OVERWHELMINGLY YET ANOTHER CONTINUING RESOLUTION AND THIS IS THE WAY WE NOW FUN THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WERE NOT ABLE TO ACTUALLY HAVE SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS ON DEPARTMENT DEPARTMENT BY DEPARTMENT LEVEL WITH REGARD TO SPENDING ERE NOT ABLE TO NEGOTIATE OVER HOW MUCH SHOULD BE SPENT ON DEFENSE OR HOW MUCH SHOULD BE SPENT ON EDUCATION INSTEAD WE SORT OF RAP EVERYTHING UP INTO A BALL AND THEN WHEN WE CAN'T GET APPROVAL ON AGIN A YEAR LONG BUDGET THEN WE GO TO CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS WHICH ARE THE SHORT FORM BUDGETS THAT CONTINUE THE GOVERNMENT SPENDING AN YOU KNOW WE JUST GEN KEEP THE TRAIN RUNNING AND THE TRAIN WILL RUN UNTIL THE TRAIN RUNS COMPLETELY OFF THOSE TRACTS ACCORDIG TO THE WALLSTRA JOURNAL CONGRESS CLEARE LEGISLATION EXTENDING GOVERNMENT FUNNY IN A MARCH A STEP THAT INSURES OF FEDERAL WORKLES WILL REMAIN ON THE JOB BUT DOES NOTHING TO ALLEVIATE UNDERLYING POLITICAL PRESSURES STENDING FROM HIGH UESD AT LEVELS RECORD CROSSING OF THE SOUTHERN BORDER AND IN ANDURING OR INEW CRANE THE SENATE PASS THAT MEASURE SEVENTY SEVENTY EIGHTEEN FOLLOWED BY HOUSE APPROVAL THREE FOURTEEN TO ONE AWAY BECAUSE AGAIN THE EASIEST THING IN CONGRESS IS TO GET LOST IN A CROWD THE EASIEST THING IN CONGRESS IS I SIMPLY SIDE WITH AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY PEOPLE WHO SAY STATUS QUOL IS JUST KEEP DOING WHAT IT IS THAT WE ARE DOING RIGHT NOW THE TWO VOTES SENT THE MEASURE TO PRESIDENT BIDON'S DESK WITH TIME TO SPARE AHEAD OF A WEAK ENDET AT LINE IN A REPLAY OF RECENT VOTES THAT UNDERSCORE THE FRAGILITY OF THE GEOPY MAJORITY ACCORDING TO THE WALSTER JOURNAL HOW SPEAKER MIGHT COHNS ON RE LIGHT HEAVILY ON DEMOCRATS TO BRING IT THAT CONTINUING RESOLUTION ACROSS THE FINISH LINE IN FACT THERE WAS A FRAUGHT MOMENT WHEN IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THERE WOULD NOT BE A MAJORITY OF REPUBLICANS IN FAVOR OF THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION AS IT TURNS OUT WHO IS ABLE TO GET A HUNDRED AN SEVEN RE PUBLICANS TO OT FOR AS SUPPOSED TO A HUNDRED AND SIX AGEINS HOUSE INTERNAL REPUBLICAN RULES PREVENT ANY REPUBLICAN FROM MOVING FOWARD WITH THE BILL THAT DOES NOT HAVE AT LEAST THE SUPPORT OF A MAJORITY OF REPUBLICANS AND SO IT CAME VERY CLOSE TO THE WIRE ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL CHIP ROY RE PUBLICAN FROM TAXAS WHO DOES IN FACTAKE SPENDING SERIOUSLY HE WAS BLASTING EVERYBODY RIGHT LEFT IN CENTOR ABOUT NOT ONLY THE SPENDING BUT THE FACT THAT NOBODY IN CONGRESS SEEMS TO WANT TO SOLVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS ANY MORE BY COLLEAES OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLE HAVE NO PROBLEM WE WIDE OPEN BORDERS IN DANGERING THE PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENT NONE AND BY CONSTENTUMENTS TO LONS LOT HOLDING THE BAG OF TE PEOPLE O TATS THROUGH THE ONS LOT SPENDING TALL IT OUT BILLIONG DOLLERS AND WY PEOPLE THE WOD UT SIX KIDS DO FOM TANAL BOYS TING ON THE SCOLD IS I THAT I REPRESENT THAT'S NOT PON O SMORK THAT IS THAT LE WE POLKING ABOUT THAT CHILDREN  TAAL POYSING BECAUSE THE WIDE OPEN BORDERS BECAUSE OF THE POLLICIES ABOT DEMI GRAT COLLEGUES WHO REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT NOT A THING NOT A THING DO MY COLLEAGUES DO ABOUT THE WIDE OPEN BORDERS AND Y WOLT CONTINUE TO SPEAK TO MY COLLEAGUES BECAUS'LL BE AN ORDER THEY DON'T THEN LAW DDRESS THIS COMMENTS TO THE CHAIR WE BOT AM SPEAKER I AVE ADDRESS HING MY COMMENTS TO THE CHAIR THE HOUSE WILL BE AN ORDER A A DRED THING THE CHAIR ALL BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENT WHO ARE DYING IT TACES BECUSE OF DEMOCRAT NO RIGTY BECAUSE OF DEMOCRAT POLICY REPRESENT A BROY THEN ADDED IT DOESN'T MATTER WHOS SITTING IN THE SPEAKER SEAT OR WHO HAS THE MAJORITY WE KEEP DOING THE SAME A STUPID STUFF WHICH REQUIRES US TO ASKU PRETTY SIMPLE QUESTION W IS IT THAT WE KEEP DOING THE SAME STUPID STUFF IS THAT A MATTER OF NOT HAVING THE WRIGHT PEOPLE IN POWER OR IS IT JUST THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE REFUSE TO RECOGNIZE THE REALITY ABOUT THEMSELVES WHICH IS THAT WE CONSTANTLY SAY WE WANT A BALANCE THE BUCH IT WE CONSTANTLY SAVE ONE O SPENDLESS MONEY AND THEN AS SOON AS THERE ARE TIS A POLE ASKING WHAT WE'LD LIKE TO CUT WE'LL RUN FOR THE HILLS WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS THAT WE'D LIKE TO CUT THE REASON BEING IT 'S VERY EASY TO SAY BROAD THINGS THAT CUTTING ON PORK BARREL PROJECTS HERE AND THERE ENSURIAN CUT A POST A POSTED OFFICE IN WEST VIRGINIA AND SURELYN GET RID OF A BRIDGE NOWHERE IN ALASKA THAT IS NOT CLENCE TOUCH TE STRUCTURAL ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMMS THAT MILLIONS AN MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE BECOME DEPENDENT UPON AND WHO ARE NOW UNWILLING TO GIVE THAT UP ALL THE THIRD RAILS OF AMERICAN POLITICS NOW FORM IN EXTRAORDINARY SPINDER WEB OF THIRD RAILS THAT NO ONE CAN TOUCH UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH IS WHY YOU HAVE SEEN CANDIDATES OF BOTH MAJOR PARTIES BASELY SIDE THEARE NO LONGER GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE SINGLE BIGGEST PROBLEM FACING THE UNITED STATES IN FUTURE DECADES AND THAT IS THE SPENDING PROBLEM DOND'NL TRUMP ITS VOUT HE IS NOT GOING TO TOUCH THAT SPENDING PROM BY THE WAY DOWN TRUMP IN FACTS HAS CAMPAIGN FROM THE LEFT AGAINST FELLOW CON SERVATIVES IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HE SAID THAT IF YOU TALK ABOUT WE STRUCTURING IN TINTLEMENT PROGRAMMS THIS MAKES YOU A LIBERAL NOW GET THAT MAKES NO SENSE ON THE FACE OF IT BUT IT'S BEEN EFFECTIVE PITCH WHY BECAUSE AGAIN AS IT TURNS OUT MANY AMERICANS ACTUALLY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS DON'T PREFER TO LEAVE THAT BOGY MAN IN THE CLOSET RATHE AN OPEN IT UP AND SIMPLY DEAL WITH IT THIS IS WHY IT FRUSTRATES ME WHEN YOU SEE ALL F THIS TALK ABOUT SPEAKER MIHT JOHNSON OLISHUS TO ALSTOM AS STO GET RID OF SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON OVER AR SOMETHING LIKE TH CONTINUING RESOLUTION O CAY I SUPPOSE YOU CAN DO THAT AND THEN WHO WILL IT BE YOU AREDY DID THIS ROUTINE WITH EAVEN MC CARTHY TERY DUM CEV MCCARTHTY OVER MACATES DID THIS SUGGESTING THAT CEVMOCARTHY HEAD GIVIN IN TOO MUCH TO THE DEMOCRATS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE DEAL THAT MC CARTHY WAS TRYING TO GO  SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN THE ONE THAT ACTUALLY ENDED UP BEING CUT AND THEN THEY PUT IN PLACE MY JOHNSON WHO AGAIN FINE GUY GOOD CONSERVATIVE BUT IS FACING THE SAME EXACT STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS THAT CEVE MC CARTHY WAS FACING IN THE FIRST PLACE HERE IS THE REALITY IN ORDER FOR ANY SERIOUS NATURE CHANGE TO GET DONE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A UNIFIED PARTY CONTROL OVER CONGRESS OVER THE SENATE OVER THE PRESIDENCY AND A DEDICATION BY THAT PARTY TO TAKE THE HIT TO TAKE THE HIT DEMOCRATS TAKE THE HITS BY THE WAY THE SOMETHING THE DEMOCRATS AR GOOD AT DEMOCRATS TOOK THE HIT IN TWO THOUSANDIN TEND IN TWO THOUSAND INTENY PASTOBOMICER AND THE THEY GOT SHALL LACHED AT THE POLES IT WAS A VERY VERY BAD MEN TERM FOR THEM AND THEY TOOK THE HID BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT IF THEY COULD COMPLETELY RESTRUCTURE THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT IN THE END THESE WO BECOME INTITLEMENTS THE PEOPLE RELIED UPON THEY WOULD RATHER TAKE THE SHORT TERM HIT FOR THE LONG TERM GAIN WHEN WAS LAST TIME RE PUBLICANS TOOK A SHORT TERM HIT FOR THE LONG TERM GAIN WHAT IS T LAST TIME THEY CAPS SOMETHING OTHER THAN TOATAK CUT THET ACTUALLY FUNDAMENTALLY RESTRUCTURE HOW FINANCES WORK IN THIS COUNTRY N THE ANSWERS THEY DON'T AND THE REASON THEY DON'T IS BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THEYILL BE TOSSED OUT OF OFFICE AND MAYBE THAT'S JUST A A GAIN A STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE IN THE WAY THAT ISYOU PARTY'S WORK IT'S VERY EASY TO GET REELECTED SUGGESTING YOU AREGOING TO SPEND MORE MONEY THAT DOESN'T EXIST THAT'S VERY HARD TO GET REELECTED SUGGESTING THATYOU'RE WONG TO CUT MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL BUDGET ESPECIALLY FROM A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT THEY NEED THAT MONEY IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT THIS IS WHY IT'S APPOINT OF HIGH IRRITATION WHEN PEOPLE SUGGEST THAT IT JUST THA JOHNSON IS A BAD GUY OR SOMETHING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TELLINGYOU THAT SORT OFTHING THE PEOPLEW ARE TELLING YOU THAT ITS JOHNSON'S FAULT THIS CONTINUING RESOLUTION GOT PASSIT IY'VE ONLY HE HAD SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT MORE GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWNS TO CAN WE DONE MULTIPLE GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN TO THE PASSFOR YEARS THAS THAT CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF THE SPENDING IN ANY REAL SIGNIFICANT WAY THE ANSWER OF COURSES NOW THE PEOPLE WHOARE ON THE AIR RIGHT NOW TELLING YOU THAT THE CON TINUING RESOLUTION SHULD BEEN PUSHED ASIDE IN FAVOR OF SOMETHING HARSHER IN FAVOR OF A GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN IN FAVOR OF A HARDER BARGAINING POSITION WITH JOBIDON THOSE PEOPLE ARE FITTING TO ABOUT THE INCENTI STRUCTION THE INCENSIVE STRUCTURE IS WITH THE INCENSIVE STRUCTURE IS AND UNLESS YOU HAVE A UNIFIED RE PUBLICAN CONTROL OF THE HOUSE THE SENATE AND THE PRESIDENCY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE KIND OF SPENDING CUTS THAT MAKE IT WORTH WHILE FOR YOU TO RISK YOUR SEATS AS I'LL TELLYOU WHAT HAPPENES THOU DO A GOERNMENT SHUT THEM HOU'RE IN A END OUT PASSING AN CONTINUAN RESOLUTION ANYWAY AND A MONC MORE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOSE THEIR SEATS WE GET TO MORE ON THIS IN JUST ONE

FREE BOTTLE OF FIBER AND SPICES SO JOHNSON IS TAKING ALL SORTS OF HEAT OVER THIS AGAIND FROM MEMBERS OF THE RIGHTWIN PRESS IS IT REALLY GOING TO DO A MANY DAMAGE IN THE LONGRUNG I THINK NOW BUT IT JUST UNDER SCORES AGAIN THE CENTRAL PROBLEM IN AMERICAN LIFE POLITICIANS MAKE A LIVING BY LINE TO YOU AND YOU HAVE CHOICE YOUR CHOICE IS WHETHER YOU LIKE BEING LIE TO AND SO YOU DECIDE TO GO LONG WITH THEIR LIVES OR WHETHER YOU DON'T LIKE BEING LIED TO ANY POLITICIAN WHO SAYS HE CAN SAVE YOU SAVE YOUR FAMILY SAVE YOUR SOCIETY BY SPENDING MONEY HEAR OR BY RESTRUCTURING A PROGRAM THERE IS LYING TO YOU THE VAST MAJORITY OF CHOICES IN YOUR LIFE ARE UP TO YOU AN THE PEOPLE RELY ON POLITICIANS TOO MUCH THAND OPSOOTING THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT AND THEN THEY BIING TO THE NEXT GRIFTER WHO COMES ALONG AN SUGGEST THAT HE'S GOING TO FIX WHATEVER PROBLEMS ARE AT HAND A SPEAKING OF GRIFTERS THE SITUATION ON THE BORDER CONTINUES TO BE A FULL SCALE DISASTER AREA IN FACT FASCINATING PIECE OF FROM THE YOURPOST HAS BEEN SUGGESTED TO ME BY THE WAY BY FRIENDS OVER AT BORDER PATROL AS WELL THE NUMBERS OF BORDER EN COUNTERS ARE DROPPING FAIRLY SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR THIS RASE THE QUESTION WHY IS THAT HAPPENING WE RECENTLY WENT DOWN TO THE BORDER AT THE VERY VERY BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AND THE END OF DECEMBER HAD BEEN LIKE A WATER A HIGH WATER MARK IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF MIGRANT ENCOUNTERS THE BORDE WERS ONG HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS O PEOPLE IN ONE MONTH ALONE AND THEN BEGNEGANUARY YOU SAW KIND AND NOT SO MUCH ONE OF THE THEORIES THAT WAS FLOATED BY BORDER PATROL WAS THE BASICALLY JO BIDON HAD CUT A D YOU WITH O'M THE IT'S MANUAL LOPEZ OBRADOR WHO IS THE LEADER AMLO THE LEADER OF MEXICO TO BASICALLY CUT DOWN ON THE ILLEGAL EMIGRATION IN AN ELECTION EAR AND NOW THIS IS BEING PRETTY OPENLY SUGGESTED BY TOD BENSMAN OVER THE NEURO POST QUOT JUST IN TIME FOR ELECTION EAR BORNER CROSSING TO PLUMETED ASSIGN THAT YO BIDON HAS STRUCK A SECRET DEAL WITH THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT'S HELP IS CAMPAIN AGAIN THIS WOULD NOT BE THE BIGGEST SHOCK IN THE WORLD REMEMBER BROKLAMA DI THIS WITH DEMETRIA METEDEVAN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE YO LITERALLY SAT NEXT TO HIM AND SAID TELVE LADIMEER IW'LL HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY AFTER THE ELECTION REMEMBER WHEN DONALD TRUMP TELLS A FOR GN COUNTRY HE WANTS THEM TO DO SOMETHING FOR ELECTORAL PURPOSES THAT'S IMPEACHABLE WE BAROCO BAMA DOES IT IN THE IDDLE OF AN ELECTION CYCLE FASTROUS POLITICS APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO THE NEROC POST DAILY BOR PATROL IN COUNTERS OF A LEGAL EMIGRANTS CROSSING THE BORDER WAS TWELVE THOUSAND TO FOURTEEN THOUSAND PER DAY AT THE END OF DECEMBER BUT ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT DATO CONFIDENTIALLY SHARED WITH ME IT IS DROPPED TO A STILL MANAGOURALY CATESTROPIC YET SMALLER FOUR THOUSAND TO FIVE THOUSAND PER DAY WHY EXACTLY IS THAT HAPPENING WELL THERE ARE BONCO BIDE ADMINISTRATION DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS TO MEXICO CITY OVER CHRISTMAS MEXICAN MEDIA IN FACT HAS BEN REPORTING WHAT WAS SAID  HERE IS SOME OF THE NEWS QUOTE MEXICAN LAW INFORCEMEN OFFICIALS ARE ROUNDING UP EMIGRANTS IN THE COUNTRY'ST NORTH AND SHIPPING THEM BY BUSANAIR PLANE TO SOUTHERN CITIES LIKE TAPITHULA IN SHOPA STATE AND VILLA ANDMOSA IN TABASCO STATE THERE RE ALL EXPECTED TO GO HOMEERS THAY PUT ALONGSIDE THOSE CONTINUING TO ENTER FROM GOATAMALA AND THEN ANOTHER STORY TO ELIMINATE ANOTHER OBVIOUS DRAW MEXICAN AUTHORITIES HAVE EMPTIED AND THEN BULDOS AT LEAST ONE LONGSTANDING MIGRAN CAMP THE SPRAWLING ONE IN MOTAMOROS ACROSS THE REOGRAN FROM BROWN'SVILT AND DUG DEEP ANS HOPNASTRAIN TRENCHES TO FURTHER DENIACCESS TO POPULAR CROSSINGS THERE IT WAS DONE UNDER OU AS FRESSARE ACCORDING TO ONE MEXICAN NEWSPAPER SO APPARENTLY IT SOUNDS VERY MUCH AS THOUGH MEXICO IS DOING JOBIDON A FAVOR IN FACT ACCORDING TO MEXICAN MEDIA THIS PART OF A BRODER AGREEMENT SIGNED BY MEXICOES IN MIGRATION SERVICE AND BORDR PATROL TO BLACK AND NORTH BOUND EMIGRANTS ON PUBLIC ROADS AS WELL WHAT EXACTLE IS MEXICO GETTING IN RETURN AMLO HAS CALLED FOR TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS TO BE SHARED AMONG HIS COUNTRY AND SOME OTHERS FOR STARTERS GOING TO METEOROPORTS IT'S ALSQY POSBWELE THE BIDEN IS TELLING AMLO THAT H'S GOING TO DO BETTER WITH BIDON THAN HE WOULD WITH TRUMP THAT WOULD NOT BE A SHOCK IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM IT HAS BECOME A PRIORITY TO JOBIDON TO GET THE EMIGRATION ISSUE OFF THE FRUM PAGES PRESUMABLY THIS IS WHY JOBIDON IS NOW THINKING ABOUT CAVING ON EMIGRATION AS HE SHOULD HIVE BEEN SAYING FOR MONTHS AT THIS POINT THAN IT IS POLITICAL MOU PRACTICE FOR JOBI NOT TO CAVE ON EMIGRATION IT MAKES NO SENTS FOR HIM TO EFFECTIVELY PUSH THE FAR LEFT TO OPEN BORDERS LINE IN THE FACE OF TERRIBLE PULLING NUMBERS WHEN HE IS RUNNING IN AN ABSOLUTE NECK AND NECK DOG FIGHT WITH DONAL TRUMP IT MAKES ZERO SENTS WHATSOEVER BY THE WAY T LATEST POLLINGDINA HAS JOBIDE WITH A VERY VERY SLIM LEAD OVERDONALD TRUMP IN AN POTENTIAL PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST NOUR MEMBER THAT BE IN THE POPULAR VOTELEAD DONALD TRUMP IF HE IS WITHIN ONE POINT OF JOBI NATIONALLY GOOD SHOTUMAN'S THE ELECTRAL COLLEGE HOWEVER THERE ARE COUPLE OF SURVEYS THAT ARE OUT ONE FROM IPSOSA AND ONE FROM YUGOV THAT GIVE BIDIN T LEAD OF BETWEEN ONE AND TO PERCENTAGE POINT IT'S

HE'S FINALLY STERING  SEE POLITICAL REALITY WHICH ACTUALLY BY THE WAY FOR THE COUNTRY IS A GOOD THING YOU WANT PRESENT BIDON TO GOVERN A LOT MORE FROM THE IDLE THAN HE HAS THUS FAR ACCORDING TO THE WALSTER JOURNAL AN AM GRATION TIL BING CRAFTON I THE SNT IT WOULD LIMIT MIGRANSTABILITY TO CLAIM ASYLUM AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER A WHITE HOUSE CONCESSION SOME PROGRESSIVE SAY SHOWS THAT PRESIDENT BINDENS LEFTWARD SHIFTS ON HIMIGRATION AS A TWENTY TWENTY CANDIDATE WAS A BLIP IN HIS LONG POLITICAL CAREER THIS OF COURSE WOUL BEPARED FOR NEW WAR AID FOR CRAIN FOR ISRAEL FORTIWAN HOUSEPEAKER MIGHT JOHNSON SET AFTER A MEETING WITH JOBIDON ON WEDNESDAY THE WHITE HAS SAID WE TALK LOUT THE MECESSARY ELEMENTS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM HE SAID THAT WOULD REQUIRE REFORM TO THE BROKEN ASYLUM AND PAROLE SYSTEMS PEARL IS BASICALLY WHERE JOBIDON SIMPLY DECLAIRS THAT MUCH PEOPLE ARE IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY HAVE BEEN PAROLED AND CAN THUS WANDER THE OUNTRY FREELY THE HAM BEEN AMNESTED BUT IT'S FINE AND AS FAR AS ASYLUM THE CURRENT ASYLUM SYSTEM IS YOU COME TO THE COUNTRY YOU CLAIM JUST WAVOUR HAND YOU SAY I FEAR TO GO HOME TO MY HOME COUNTRY THE RELEASION O TH COUNTRYTHAN SEVENTY TO OURS INER GONE REPUBLICANS WOULD LIKE REMAIN IN MEXICO BIDNS NOT GIVING THEM REMAIN IN MEXICO SO FAR THIS IS WHAT THEY SHOULD PUSH FOR BY THE WAY REPUBLICANS SHOULD PUSH FOR REMAIN IN MEXICO AS NATIONAL EMIGRATION POLICY HOWEVER JOBIDON IS IN FACT MOVING AT THIS POINT HE'S MOVING AGAIN BECAUSE THE PULNUMBERS FOR HIM ARE DIR SIXTY EIGHT PER SENTS OF THOSE SURVEYE AND HE SE BE US AT NEWSPOLE SAY THEY DISAPPROVE OF HIS BORER POLICIES SO HE IS NOW MOVING AND SHIFTING ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE BIDON APPARENTLY AGAIN HE DOESN'T WANT REMAIN IN MEXICO BECAUSE H'S A FRA THAT IF HE SAYS REMAIN IN MEXICO THAN TAT WILD GIVE SOMETHING FOR TRUMP TO RUN ON WHICH IS WEIRED AS THAT IT'S BAD LOGIC IF HE DID REMAIN I MEXICO HE WULD HAVE TO MIT THE TRUMP WAS RIGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT ALSO HE WOULD SAY THAT HE GOT A RIGHT NOW SO WHAT EXACTLY IS THE MAJOR ISSUE APPARENTLY THE PRESIDENT WAS ORIGINALLY INFLUENCED BY WAIT FRIT FIRST LATY DOCTOR JOBIDNEW IS ORIGINALLY DOCTOR JOBIDON WHO PUSH HIM TO THE LEFT ON EMIGRATION BECAUSE SHE'S VERY UPSET WITH FAMILLY SEPARATIONS AND REMAIN IN MEXICO SHE HAD VISITED A TENT OF MIGRANS WLIVING JUST TO CROSS THE SOUTHERN BORDER IN MATAMOROS ONE MOST DANGEROUS CITIES IN MEXICO SO HE GOT RID OF REMAIN IN MEXICO AND ALL THE REST BUT NOW IT LOOKS AS THOUGH HE'S GEEN TO HAVE TO BRING BACK SOME OF THIS STUFF HE'S STILL UNCOMFORTABLE IF BRINGIG BACK ANY FORM OF REMAIN IN MEXICO ACCORDING TO THE WALTR JOURNAL BUT ADVISERS OUR BRINGING HIM NUMEROUS IDEAS ON WEES TO RUN THAT PROGRAM THAT GIVE PRIORITY TO MIGRAN'S SAFETY SO MAYBE HE'LLBRING BACK REMAIN IN MEXICO WHICH BY THE WAY ACCORDING TO MY FRIENDS IN BOR PATRA OULD BE THE SINGLE BIGGEST CHANGE HE COULD MAKE THOUGH MECTUALLY SHUT DOWN MASS MIGRATION TO THE BORDER IN FACT HE'S BEING PUSHED TO HIS RIGHT EVEN BY DEMOCRATS ACCORDING TO THE DAILY WIRE FOURTEEN HOUSE DEMOCRATS VOTED TO DENOUNCE THE BIDE ADMINISTRATION TO OPEN BORER'S POLICIES ON WEDNESDAY THE GROUP OF PARTY DEFECTOR JOIND WITH ALV VOTING REPUBLICANS IN PASSING A RESOLUTION INTRODUCED BY REPRESENTATIVE NATHANIAL MORE AN REPUBLICAN OF TAXAS TWELVE DEMOCRATS AN NINE REPUBLICANS DID NOT VOTE IN ADDITIONS WHO DENOUNCING JOBITON'S WATER POLICIES THE RESOLUTION CONDEMNED THE NATIONAL SECURITY AND PUBLIC SAFETY CRISIS ALONG THE SOUTH WEST O BORDER SO IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENS HERE DONAL TRUMP FOR HIS PART IS IS DOING SOMETHING SOMEWHAT STRANGE TRUMP HAS BEEN A SUGGESTING THAT PERHAPS REPUBLICANS SHOULD NOT CUT ANY DEAL WITH JOBI NINE EMIGRATION WHATSOEVER THESE OF THE CONNAGUL THEN PRESUMABLY HES CAN BE ABLE TO TAWS THAT HE'S MORE MODERN AND EMIGRATE ON EMIGRATION THAN HE HAS HERETO FORBID BUT HONESTLY THAT IS NOT THE WAY THE CONGRESSIONAL POLITICS TYPICALLY OUGHT TO WORK IF YOUN GET A BIG CONCESSION OUT OF DEMOCRATIC PRESIEN YO DO IT AND TRUMPKANS TOL RUN ON IT IN ONE THING THAT OU'RE NOT CONAS SY BID AN RUN ON IS MASKEDY PORTATIONS THAT THE XACO TRUMP IS RUNNING ON HERE HE WAS YESTERDAY BUT THE RE ALSO PEOPLE THE COUNTRY O COUNTRIES DON'T WANT THEN THAT SENDING THET BEST PEOPLE OVER YOU KNOW THES GAS A SMART I KNOW THE PRESIDENTS THE DICTATORS THE PRIMEMINISTERS OCOBSELVES PRIMEMINISTERS BUT THEY WERY SLARD PEOPLE AND THEN THAT SENDING THERE HARD WORKERS OF THE T YOU GET A LOT OF PEOPLE COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY THAT WUL NOT GET A WANT WE DON'T WANT AND WIGER T HAVE THE LARGEST DEPORTATION OF THE HISTORY AGAIN TRUMP IS NOT CAN GET OUT FLANKS BY BIDON ON EMIGRATION POLICIES SO CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS OUGHT TO VERY SERIOUSLY PUSH JOBIDON AS FAR AS THEY CAN AND THEN TAKE A WIND IT S GOOD TO TAKE WINDS FROM JOBI NI UNDERSTAND THAN WE NOW LIVE IN A WEIRD UNIVERSE IN WHICH SOMEHOW PRINE GIANT CONCESSIONS OUT OF JOBIDON IS CONSIDERED A LOSS OF SOME SORT BUT THAT'S NOT HOW THIS WORKS THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT WAS LOST IS GOT ZERO CONCESSIONS OUT OF JOBIDON ON THE INFLATION RODUCTION ACTOR COULD JUST KILL THAT ONE OUTRIGHT BUT ON THIS ONE REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY DO BY ENLARGE WANT ISRAEL AID REPUBLICANS ARE SPLIT FAIRLY DOWN THE MIDDLE ON YOU CRANAD THEY DO WANT MORE AD FOR TIWAN AND THEY CERTAINLY WANT WIRE BOREA SECURITY MEASURES AND YOU GET WHAT YOUCAN GET BECAUSE FRANKLY THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT DONALD TRUMPES GON T BE PRESIDENT COME JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ANYWAY HE OGHT TO GET WHAT'S ON THE TABLE BTHE FACT THO MY JOHNSON AND THE REPUBLICANS HAVE MANEUVERED JOBIDING TO A BAD IMIGRATION POSITION IS GOOD FOR THEM AND IF THEY CAN GET A BIG CONCESSION OUT OF THAT THEY ABSOLUTELY SHOULD LET TEMORE ON THIS IN JUST ONE SECOND FIRST THE BENSHIP PIROSHO IS

GO TO   FEUDERAL OR YOU CAN GO TO TOUT WHITH YOU CAN DO BOTH I GO TO IS TER ITHOTO IS TERRIBLE SO THEY WOULD RATHER HAVE BE MIS THE FUDERAL OR GO TO THE FUDERAL MISTERTRAL AN THAT'S A NASTY MAN HES A NASTY JUDGE E'S A TRUMPATING GUI AND AIT'S OBVIOUS EVERYBODY IN THE COURT SA DISGRACE FACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING AT AH DISGRACE I DO LOVE DON TRUMS USE OF THE WORD NASTY HE'S BRING IT BACK IN HIS ORIGINAL SENSE WHICH IT WISH THAT KIND OF APPRECIATE AGAIN IS ANY OF THIS CAN T HAVE NE MARKAN IMPACT ON TRUMPS CAMPAIGN I THING NOT THERE ARE THINGS THAT COULD THEORETICALLY HAVE AN IMPACTD ON TRUMPS CAMPAGN LIKE FOR EXAMPLE HIM BEING IN THE NEWS EVERYDAY BUT WOULD HAVE TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S NOT ALREADY PART OF THE BACKGROUND IN FORMATION OF OUR LIVES AND THAT IS VERY DIFICULT TO DO WITH DONAL TRUMP I'VE SAID THAT SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN DONT TRUMPSY GIANT MUD MONSTER AND THE MORE MIGD YOU THROUT HIM THE MORE HE JUST LOOKS LIKE A GIANT MUD MONSTER JOBIDON THAT YOU DISPOSED TO BE GOOD AT THIS AND HE HAS NOT KED ED THIS IT IS A VERY VERY REAL PROBLEM NOW MEANWHILE THE FOREIGN AFFAIRERS OF TE UNITED STATES ARE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE IF DIKA LOOK I THE MIDDLE EAST OBVIOUSLY THEY CONTINUE TO BE IN VERY SERIOU ROLD PACASTAN IS NOW APPARENTLY STRIKING INSIDE ORON SO TURNS OUT THE WHEN YOU DON'T CONTAINER ON OR ON A LASH IS OUT AT PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY ACCORDING TO TH WALSTRETURNAL OR ON'S MILITARY TESTED AND FOUND A LIMIT TO ITS ABILITY TO PROJECT POWER THIS WEEK AS PACKASTAN RESPONDED TO A MISTIL ATTACK WITH THE FIRST PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGE TO AIR STRKE ON ARONI AND TERRITORY IN DECADES THE PACASANIA RITALIATION FOLLOWED ORON'S FIRST RECT ATTACKS IN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES SINCE ISRAELS WAR WITH COMASS IN GAZA BEGAN IN OCTOBER TO NAG YOU HA PACKASTAN WHICH IS AN ALLIES SADARABIA FIRING AT ARON I RON FIRING AT PACKASTAN YOU HAVE CONTINUING ROCKET FIRE FROM ARONBAKCAMAS INTO ISRAEL YOU HAVE ROCK AD FIRE FROM ARONBACKS  HIS BALA INTO ISRAEL YOU OVE ROCK AND FIRE FROM FROM ERON BACK WHO THESE AT SHIPPING IN THE RED SEA AND JOBIDON STILL HAS NO PLAN FOR ANY OF THIS IN FACT IT SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY SORT OF PLANS THAT ARE MERGING OR SPERATIC STRIKES ON IPPOSING POSITIONS THAT DON'T SEEM TO BE ACHIEVING ANYTHING LIKE THEIR PURPOSE AND PRESSURE ON THESE RAILIES TO STOP DOING WHAT THEY ARE DOING THAT SEEMS LIKE WHAT THAT THAT SEEMS LIKE THE PLAN BUT JUST WHAT THESE RAILS ARE NOCK ON ASTOP BECAUSE THERE IS WIDESPREAD SUPPORT INSIDE ISRAEL TO TAKE OUT HAMASS AS THERE SHOULD BE IN FACT IN BRAKING NEWS TWENTY ONE MORE HOSTAGES THEIR BODIES WERE JUST FOUND COMAS HAD MURDERED THEM SO AGAIN ALL OF THIS IS JUST GOING TO ALL THIS IS JUST GOING TO CONTINUE BECAUSE THE BY DEMINISTRATION DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANY SORT OF PLAN FOR WHAT A REALISTIC MIDDLE EAST LOOKS LIKE HER'S A LOT OF TALK TODAY ABOUT PRIME MINISTER BENJAMININTINAHO TALKING ABOUT THE IDEA THAT ISRAEL OUGHT TO MAINTAIN TERRITORIAL SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE ENTIRE AREA FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN SEE TO THE JORDAN RIVER IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN SECURITY IF ANY ONE ELSE HAS ANY OPTIONS I AM SURE PEOPLE W LOVE TO HEAR THEM NO OTHER OPTIONS HAVE BEN PROVIDED AND EVERY TIME JOBIDING IN HIS TEEM SUGGEST THAT ISRAEL OUGHT TO HANDS OVER LAND IN CONCESSIONS TO TERROREST GROUPS ALL THEY ARE DOING IS FOMENTING WHAT A RON WANTS THE REALITIES THAT TERRORSM IS NOT MOTIVATED BY POVERTY AN DESPAIR TERRORISM IS MOTIVATED BY HOPE HOPE THAT THE OTHER SIDE WILL BE WEAK ENOUGH TO LEAVE YOU ALONE TO LEAVE YOU LIVING AFTER YOU HAVE COMMITTED SOME THE WORST ATROCITYES KNOWN TO MAN IT IS TOTALLY INTAIN THE DIBID DEMINISTRATION CONTINUES SO PRESSURE EXACTLY THE WRONG SIDE ON THIS SORT OF THING NOW I WILL SAY THA BY DEMINISTRATION HAS PROVIDED THE MILITARY AID SO FAR NECESSARY FOR ISRAEL TO CONTINUE ITS WAR AGAINST COMASE THAT IS TRUE BAT ARE TORICALLY SPEAKING IT DOES MAKE A RATHER LARGE DIFFERENC WHEN YOU KEEP SIGNALLING TWO TERRORS TAN HAMASS THAT ALL THEY HAVE TO DO O STAY A LIVE LONG ENOUGH AND EVENTUALLY THEY WILL GET WHAT THEY WANT WHICH IS NAMELY TO BE LEFT ALONE SURVIVALS THEY CAN CONTINUE TO PLAN ATTACKS AND MURDER JUWS IN THE FUTURE AND ALSO DOESN'T HOW HELP WHEN YOU HAVE DOLTS LIKE BURNIG SANDERS DOING THIS ROTINE BURNING SANDERS YESTERDAY SUGGESTED THAT ISRAEL IS GOING TOWARD THE ENTIRE PALISTONIAN PEOPLE WHICH IS A WEIRD TAKE CONSIDERING AGAIN THAT ISRAEL HAS NOW SACRIFICED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED OF ITS OWN MEN AND WOMEN IN A T E AREA WHERE THY HAVE COMPLETE AIRO SUPERIORITY AND DON'T NEED TO SACRIFICE LITERALLY ANY OF THOSE MEN OR WOMEN IN THAT AREA IN ORDER TO PROTECT PALISTONIAN CIVILIANS HERE'S BURNING SANDERS BEING A A TOOL BECAUSE HE IS MY DOU FOM THEY ONE CRIST HAS BEEN I THAT ISRAEL HAS THE RIGHT TO RESPOND TE COMASSAS BU BARIC A TAC ON A OBESEMEN BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TOGOT A WAR AGAINST THE ENTIRE POLISTHINIAN PEOPLE WHICH IS WHAT WE AVE SEING WIGHT NOW IT AS YOU JUST MENTION DO YOU MATTER CARRYIN SUCH ATION IN COSS AN NOW IS UNBELIEVABLY BAD AND WE LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN STOLPING WE CANNOT ALLOW THAT THATISRALLY IS CURRENTLY ATTEMPTING TO SHIP IN MORE AID AND THERE IS KNOW ONE ON THE OTHER END O PIC UP THE AID COMASI PICKING UP THE AID AND THEY AR STEALING THE AID IN THE WORLD IS CAN A CONTINUED TO BE AN INCREDIBLY FRAGURAL PLACE BECAUSE OF JOBIDON WEIRDLY THOUGH THERE IS THIS CODERY OF PEOPLE WHO EXIST AT THE TOP OF SOCIETY N OUR GLOBAL INSTITUTIONS WHO BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE DOING A GOOD JOB AND THAT THE TRUE THREAT TO INTERNATIONAL SECURITY IS DONALD TRUNK WILL GET TO THAT IN JUST ONE SECOND FIRST LADY BALLERS IT'S THE HILARIAS STORY OF HOW GROUP OF MAL LOSERS WHO CAN'T WIN AGAINST OTHER MEN DECIDE TO IDENTIFY AS YOU KNOW LADIES AND JOIN WOMEN'S BASCAVOLING SURETS ABSURDITS RIDICULOUS ITS LAUGHABLE ALSO IT HAPPENS TO BE VERY CLOSE TO REALITY HERE'S A QUICK LUCK AND WHAT IS BEING CALLED THE MOST TRIGGERING MOVY OF THE DECADE BET I LUCY  O ALYY  TAESCA HIS E IS A STRINGT AAND INTASTRANOIIA WAT I

DURING HIS FIRST TERM IN OFFICE AND YOU CONSTANTLY S OR JUEL WAY WITH SILLY SHIVALISTS THAT HAD BEEN SPOKEN BY THE FORM POLICY ELED YOU'D BREAK THOSE IDIOCIES ON THE WHEEL OF REALITY AND THEY'VE BEEN VERY UPSET EVER SINCE THAT HE DID THAT ANCE THEY DON'T WANT HIM BACK THIS PRESUMABLY IS WHY THEY CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN LI AFTER LIE WITH REGARD TO INTERNATIONAL POLITICS SO OVER AT THE CONTINUING WORLD ECONOMIC FORM OVER AT DAVAS VARIOUS DOLTS LARGE AND SMALL CONTINU TO MAINTAIN THE DONNEL TRUMPET IS THE TRUEST THRATS IT TO THE WORLD ORDER A WOMAN IN VERA GURAVA SHE SUGGEST THAT THE BIGGEST PROB

ABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN OPINION IN FACT THAT WAS THE VP OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION MEANWHILE THE WORLD BANK PRESENTENT CONTINUES TO SPEAK THACTUAL FALSEHOODS LIKE WE CAN'T ERADICATE POVERTY WITHOUT SOLVING CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH WAS WEIRD SINCE WE DONE A PRETTY DAMNED GOOD JOB OVER THE COURSE OF LAST FORTY FIVE YEARS ON THIS PLANTET IN ERADICATING EXTREME POVERTY NOT ONLY WITHOUT SOLVING CLAMA CHANGE BUT ACCORDING TO YOU GO IS BY EXASCERBATING CLIMATE CHANGE CAUSE IT TURNS OUT THE CARMONBASE FOSSIL FUELS ARE ONE OF THE GREAT SOURCES OF HUMAN WEALTH EVER DEVISED AN SO RALLY THING  A

PROPPING UP BAD REGIMES THAT VERY OFTEN THE CLIMATE CHANGE TALK IS ABOUT TO GRATING SOME OF THE MOST PRE DUCTIVE REGIMES IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND NAMELY PLACE LIKE THE UNITED STATES IN EUROPE IN FAVOR OF SIGNIFICANTLY LESSIPRODUCTIVE REGIMES THEY ARE LOOKING FOR SUBSIDIES AND HANDOUTS THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT IS GOING ON WITH CHINA BY THE WAY ACCORDING TO THE WALS FORE JOURNAL CHINAS NOW DOUBLING DOWN ON MANUFACTURING TO REBOOTITS ECONOMY AFTER A TURBULENT YEAR THE PUSH FOR NEW GROWTH DRIVERS COMES AS FIGURES SHOWED THE WORLDS SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY EXPANDED AT TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND IT'S WEAKESTO RATE IN DECATES WHAT EXACTLY ARE THEY GOING TO DO APPARENTLY THEY WANT TO DOMINATE GLOBAL MARKETS IN EMERGING INDUSTRIES LIKE ELECTRIC VEHICLES BATTERIES AND RENEWABL ENERGY YEAR SO THEY WANT THE UNITED STATES IN THE E OUS TO SUBSIDIZE A BUNCH OF GREEN ENERGY BOONS OGGLES WHERE THE MONEY EVENTUALLY ANDS UP IN CHINA THEY REQUIRE THE SUBSIDIES THOSE OF THE PLACES WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO EARN THEI'RE MONEY THE HOPE IS THAT GROWTH IN WHAT CHINESE OFFICIALS REFERRED TO AS THE NEW THREE INDUSTRIES AND OTHER FAVORITE SECTORS WHELL HOLP CHINAS ECONONY BANISHE THE SPECTORS OF DEFLATION AND GAPANSTYLE STAGNATION AS A REALISTAT CRUNCHWAYS HEAVILY ON CONSTRUCTION INVESTMEN AND CONSUMERA CONFIDENTE WON RETURMBATION WANTS THESE AND OTHER HIGHTIC MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES TO BE IN THE VAN GUARD OF ITS PUSH TO EVENTUALLY UNSEE THE UNITED STATES AS THE WORLD LARGEST ECONOMY WIL THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPENIN THE REASON IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IS BECAUSE HEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY TARGONING EFFICIENT SECTORS OF THE MARKET FOR GROWTH INSTEAD WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS FINDING PLACES THAT REQUIRE GOVERNMENT SUBSINIZATION AND REDISTRIBUTION IN ORDER TO HAVE EVERYBODY PAY THEM TO OFFSHORE ALL OF THAT A GOOD LUCK TO THEM BUT AGAIN THIS IS ABOUT GLOBL FINANCURAL RESTRUCTURING AN THE PEOPLE TO W F KNOW THAT AND TRUMP IS A THREAT TO THAT BECAUSE HE ASTURALLY DOES LIKE AMERICA I SUPPOSE TO MANY OF THESE OTHER PEOPLE WHO SEEM TO HAVE A PECULIAR GLOBAL UTOPIA IN MIND THAT THEY WISH TO PURSUES SPEAKING OF PEOPLE PURSUING A GLOBAL SOCIALIST UTOPIA OVER IN CANADA A WHAT THEY HALL HAPPEN TO CANADA THE TARGON AND MY FRIEND GORDAN PETERSON CONTINUES A PACE S IS AN INSANE STORY SO JORDAN FOR THOSE WHO ASH YOU DON'T O JORDAN PETERSON'S HISTORY PROBABLY THE MOST FAMOUS PSYCHOLOGIST ON PLANAN EARTH ONE MOST BEEN IS PUBLIC INTELLECTUALS ON THE PLANET GJORDAN WAS BASICALLY OBSCURER OR LEA SEMI OBSCURE IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THEN BILL SEE SIXTEEN AROSE AND ONTEREO AS A BILL THAT WAS EXPLICITLY DESINED TO SHUT DOWN SPEECH WITH REGARD TO TRANS ISSUES AN YOU MIGHT FALL UNDER THE THREAT OF PUNISHMENT IF YOU SAD THAT A BOY IS NOT A GIROL FOR EXAMPLE AND JORDAN SPOKE UP ABOUT THIS AND HE SPOKE LOUDLY ABOUT THIS AND HE BECAME NATIONAL FIGURE BECAUSE OF THIS AND THEN HANDED UP IN THE MEDEA SPEAKING BATTLE THE STUFF AND HE PERFORMED INCREDIBLY WELL NAY WROTE TWELVE RULES FOR LIFE AND THAT WAS A HUGE INTER NATIONAL BY CELLER SULS AMONG FIVE SIX MILLION COPIES AND ALL THIS NOW OF COURSE HE WORKS THUS OVER THE DAILY WIRE AMONG HIS OTHER PROJECT WHE AE NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO CANADA DECIDED TO TARGA JORDAN PETERSON TERE'S AN ADMINISTRATIVE BOARD THAT REGULATES THE CONDUCT OF PSYCHOLOGIST AND THEY DECIDED THE JORDAN'S POLITICAL VIEWS WHERE A DISGRACE TO HIS PROFESSION AND THAT OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY GENERALLY NOW REMEMBERING CANADATES NOT TO DISGRACE TO CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY TO MUTILATE YOUNG BOYS AND GIRLS IN THE BIZAR HOPE THAT THEY WILL TURN INTO MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITE SAC THAT'S NORMAL WHAT'S REALLY BAD AS IF YOU TWEET SO JORDAN WAS SENTINS BY ABOARD THE ONTERIO COLLEGE OF HIS PSYCHOLOGISTS TO A BOUT OF MANATORY REEDUCATION OF INDETERMINATORATION AT HIS EXPENSE HIS LEARNING WOULD NOT BE AVALUED BY ANY STANDARD METHOD BUT SUBJECTS THE OPINION OF THOSE CHARGED WITH PROFITING BY AN EXPLOITING MY FORE STUDENTSHIP SAYS JORDAN HE TOOK THE DECISION MAKERS TO COURT AND THEN HE LOST BECAUSE CANADA IS NO LONGER A FREE COUNTRY THE DECISION OF THE ON TERIO COLOGE OF PSYCHOLOGIST WAS APPELD THEN APPEALD TO A HIGHER COURT AND THEN JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO THAT APEAL WAS REJECTED NO REASONS WERE PROVIDED IT SO AS JORDAN WRIGHTS IN THE NATIONAL POST HE NOW FACES TWO CHOICES FIRST HE CAN COMPLY WHEN THE CHOLOGE GOES AHEAD WITH ITS DETERMINATION TO REQUIRE MY RE EDUCATION DUTIFULLY ATTEND WHATEVER BLOODY CLASSES THEIR D I ENTHUSIAST SOCIAL MEDIA EXPERTS WHATEVER THOSE ARE T DETERMINED TO ANFLICT UPON CONFESS THE SINS OF MY CLASSIC LIBERAL CONSERVATIVE OR EVEN JUDAO CHRISTION POLITICAL PHILOSOPHICAL AND THEOLOGICAL COMCOMMITMENTS REPENT AND SILENCE MYSELF OR EVEN BECOME A STANDARD BEARER FOR THE FOE COMPASSIONAT WILL CAUSE AT TLESE PUBLICLY ALTERNATIVELY I CAN TELL MY WOULD BE MASTERS GO DIRECTLY TO HELD THEIR SO RAPIDLY GATHERING AROUND THEMSELVES IN EVERYONE ELSE MOSE MY RIGHT TO PRACTICE OR EVEN DISCRIBE MYSELF AS HE PSYCHOLOGIST AND SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES ON THE REPUTATION FRONT THET HAVELINE HE SAYS WOULD BE CANADIAN PSYCHOLOGIS JORDAN BE PETERSON DISGRACED TO HIS PROFESSION FORFEITS HIS FORMAL LICENSE AND CONSEQUENTE OF HIS CRIMES SO WHAT EXACTLY ARE THE CRIMES A JORDAN SAYS THIS WEARE THE READER SHULD PAKE CAREFUL ATTENTION THIS WHET ELIZA HAD IN THE LEST GIVEN THE COURSE OF OUR LEADERS IN THEIR STILL BLIND AND DEPAT FOLLOWERS IT SHOULD BE HARD FOR ANY ONE CONSIDERING THE SITUATION O BELIEVE I'M PLAING STRAIT WITH THE FACTS IF THEY HAVE THEIR OWN OPINIONS ORE VALUES WHAT SOEVER BECAUSE IF WHAT I HAVE HADN'T DONE CONSTITUTES THE EQUIVALENT OF A PROFESSIONAL CRIME YOU CAN BE SURE YOUR OWN HAD IS FULL OF LAKE AT TRANSGRESSIONS SO HERES WHAT HE DID HE CRITICIZED AT THREE CANADIAN POLITICAL LEADERS A COUNCIL WOMAN IN CANADA'S CAPITAL OTTOWA FOR IT I REGARDED AND STILL REGAR AS FOR DISGRACEFUL BEHAVIOR DURING THE CANADIAN TRUCR CONVOY JUST INTRUDOS FORMER PRINCIPAL PSECRETARY GERAL BUTS A MAN WHO RESINED FROR ONE OF THE HIGHEST POSITIONS WITHIN THE OFFICE OF THE FORMER AMIDST O SCANDALD THAT HAD ENVELOPE THE TEPHLONAC COTED LIBERAL ADMINISTRATION AND THE LOLD POSTERBOY IN SHINING

JOROGAN'S PODCAST THE ENTIRE THREE HOUR PLUS TRANSCRIPT WAS SUBMITTED THAT TO MY CHOLEGEIS EVIDENT TOF MY DISGRACEFUL CONDUCT I  VOICED MY OBJECTIONS THE POLITICALLY CORRE CT INSISTENCE THAN MORBID OBECITY BE RE GARDED AS THE IN QUIVALENTS TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF ATHLETIC BEAUTY AND I TOOK A CERTAIN HOLUWOD ACTRESS OR ACTOR TO TAS BEC AUS THAT SAME PERSON USED ITS PLATFORM TO PARADE THE ADVANTAGES OF DOUBLE MAST ACTOMIES WHEN PERFORMED ON THE BODIES OF PERFECTLY HEALTHY YOUNG WOMEN I REGRET NONE OF THESE ACTIONS THESE CRIMES WERE APORTED ON THE PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE ON TERIO COLLEGE OF PSYCHOLOGIST WEBSIDE IN FORMER PAGE NOT BY ANY ONE WHATEVER ACTUALLY YOU KNOW USE JORDANAS A PSYCHOLOGIST OR BY ANY ONE WHO EVEN KNEW HIM YHEU ARE INSTEAD BROUGHT TO THE INTENTION OF THE AUTHORITIES BY ACTIVIS IN OTHER COUNTRIES MANY OF WHOM ALSO LIET IN RIHTING CLAIMING THAT THEY WERE IN FACT MY CLIENS SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WHAL DOESN'T MEAN A LOT PRACTICALLY AS JORDAN SAYS BUT HE SAYS THAT HE IS GOING TO FIGHT THIS THING ALL THE WAY TO THE ENDS HE SAYS CANADIANS MARK MY WORDS YOURE MUCH VANT TO CHARTER OF RIHTS IS N' WORE THE PAPER ITS PRINTED ON AS ONE OF ITS LAST REMAINING SIGNATORIES

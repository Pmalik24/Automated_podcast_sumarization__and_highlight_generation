WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LACONCA  DISCUSS SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TO FRLI I MAY DRAHUBERMEN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NAUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TODAY MY GUEST IS DOCTOR MARRY HELEN IM MORDINO YANG DOCTOR IMORDINO YANG IS A PROFESSOR OF EDUCATION PSYCHOLOGY AND NAURO SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HER LABORATORY FOCUSES ON EMOTIONS AND THE ROLL OF EMOTIONS IN LEARNING AS WELL AS HOW SOCIAL INTERACTIONS IMPACT HOW WE LEARN TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS ONE THAT I FOUND ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING BECAUSE IT WILL REVEAL TO YOU IN FACT TO ALL OF US HOW OUR TEMPERAMENT THAT IS OUR EMOTIONALITY COMBINED WITH OUR HOME ENVIRONMENT AND THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENTS THAT WE WERE RAISED IN SHAPE WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE WORLD AND OUR CONCEPTS IFSELF IN THINKING ABOUT THAT WE ALSO DISCUSS THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND HOW DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF RULES AND HOW WE ARE TOLD TO BEHAVE IN WHAT ACTUALLY CONSTITUTES GOOD BEHAVIOR OR BAD BEHAVIOR SHAPE HOW WE LEARN INFORMATION ND DEVELOP A SENSE OF MEANING IN LIFE IF ANY OF THAT SOUNDS ABSTRACT I PROMISE YOU THAT TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS INCREDIBLY PRACTICAL YOU WILL LEARN FOR INSTANCE HOW DIFFERENT STYLES OF LEARNING ARE GOING TO FAVOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE FROM CHILDREN INTO ADULTHOOD AND HOW WE OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT LEARNING IN TERMS OF OUR MOTIONAL SYSTEMS BEING OUR GUIDE FOR WHAT WE LEARN AND THE INFORMATION THAT WE RETAIN AND HOW WE APPLY THAT INFORMATION THROUGHOUT LIFE FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE PARENTS OR WHO ARE THINKING OF BECOMING PARENTS OR WHO WERE ONCE CHILDREN I BELIEVE THAT INCOMPASSES EVERYBODY OUT THERE TODAY'S DISCUSSION WILL ARM YOU WITH AN INTELLECTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF PSYCHOLOGY AND NAUR SCIENCE AS IT RELATES TO LEARNING BUT ALSO PRACTICAL TOOLS THAT YOU CAN APPLUIDE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO LEARN MORE EFFECTIVELY WHAT I LIKE SO MUCH ABOUT DOCTOR IMMORDINO YANG'S RESEARCH AND THE DISCUSSION TODAY IS THAT SHE FRAMES UP BEAUTIFULLY HOW THOSE WHO BEST LEARN FROM TRADITIONAL FORMS OF CLASSFROM LE ARNING AS WELL AS THOSE WHO LEARN FROM NON TRADITIONAL FORMS OF LEARNING EITHER IN OR OUT OF THE CLASSERUM CAN BEST USE THAT UNDERSTANDING OF SELF IN ORDER TO LEARN IN THE WAY THAT IS BEST FOR THEM BEFORE WOU BEGIN ID LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTOROLITE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR WSALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLYTES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLITE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHYSITS IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACKTOLECTROLITE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT ONE GRAHAM OF SODIUM TWO UNDER MILIGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'AVE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT DOC COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT EL EMENT DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR MARRY HELEN IMMORDINO YANG DOCTOR IMORDINO YANG GET HERE GREAT TO HAVE YOU I'D LIKE TO START OFF TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT TO ME SEEMS A LITTLE BAT HIGH LEVEL BUT I THINK IT'S THE PERFECT JUMPING OFF POINT I'VE HEARD YOU TALK BEFORE ABOUT INSPIRATION AND AL A AND A OMEBODY WHOIS INTERESTED IN THE BRAIN AND A SOMEBODY WHOIS INTERESTED IN THE ROLE OF EMOTIONS AND LEARNING AND LIFE EXPERIENCE INSPIRATION AND AWE SEEMED TO ME RATHER HIGH LEVEL EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES COMPARED TO SAY FEAR OR HAPPINESS AND YET INSPIRATION AND AWE JUST SEEM SO FUNDAMENTAL TO HOW WE LEARN AND NAVIGATE LIFE AND BEFORE WE STARTED RECORDING WE WERE TALKING ABOUT DAVID GOGGINS OF ALL PEOPLE EM AND WE'LL GET BACK TO THAT BUT IF YOU COULD YO SHARE WITH US WHAT IS THE ROLE OF INSPIRATION AND AWE AN STORY IN HOW WE LEARN AND EXPERIENCE LIFE STARTING AT A YOUNG AGE AND THEN MAYBE WE CAN TRANSITION TO OLDER AGES YET I MEAN I THINK WHAT YOU'VE NOTICED IS ACTUALLY FUNDAMENTAL TO THE CANUNDRUM OF BEING A HUMAN IS THAT OUR MOST HIGH LEVEL COMPLEX BRAINSTATES MIND STATES ARE ALSO FUNDAMENTALLY HOOKING THEMSELVES INTO THE MOST BASIC BIOLOGICAL MACHINERY THAT LITERALLY WE SHARE WITH ALLIGATORS THAT KEEPS US ALIVE AND THAT IS BOTH THE POWER AND THE POTENTIAL OF A BEING A HUMAN AND THE DANGER OF IT SO OUR BELIEFS ARE EXPERIENCES ARE INTERPRETATIONS OF THE MEANING OF THINGS WHICH THAT'S WHERE THE STORY COMES AND THE STORIES THAT WE CONJURE ABOUT UNO COLLECTIVELY WITH OTHER PEOPLE CULTURALLY IN SPACES INSIDE OUE OUNSELVES ALSO THOSE STORIES BECOME KIND OF THE THROUGH LINE THAT ORGANIZES THE WAY IN WHICH WE CONSTRUCT AR OUND EXPERIENCE CONSCIOUSNESS EVEN I WOULD SAY SO WHEN WE HOOK INTO THOSE VERIE BASIC SURVIVAL SYSTEMS BY RECRUITING THEM INTO THESE NARRATIVES ABOUT THE NATURE OF REALITY THE POWER OF THE MEANING WE MAKE WHAT HAPPENS AS WE GET THIS AMAZINGL IT BOTH FUNDAMENTAL AND HIGH LEVEL STATE SIMULTANEOUSLY WHERE WE FEEL EXPANSIVE WE FEEL A LIKE IT'S ALL SO INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL AND WE ARE I WOULD ARGUE ACTUALLY RAMPING INTO ORE CATCHING INTO THE VERY BASIC SURVIVAL MECHANISMS THAT MAKE US CONSCIOUS THAT MAKE US ALIVE AND AND THAT'S THAT'S IN ESSENCE THE POWER OF BEING A HUMAN THAT'S THE POWER OF OUR INTELLIGENCE AT THIS LATE STATE IN OUR EVOLUTION SO WHEN I WAS A KID I LOVE STORIES OF ALL KINDS I THINK LIKE MOST KIDS I LOVED MY CURIOUS GEORGE BOOKS I'M TOLD I LIKED THE BAB AR BOOKS BUT THEN QUICKLY DIDN'T LIKE THE BABOUR BOOKS AM I LIKED THE BOOK WHERE THE RED FERN GROWS I LIKED AM BOOKS IN STORIES ABOUT IT GENERALLY WAS BOYS FOR ME FOR WHATEVER REASON A THAT HAD SOME IDEA IN MIND OR SOME ONGOING CHALLENGE AND THAT PLAYED OUT OVER TIME AND THE CHARACTER REVOLVES ACROSS THE STORY AND OF COURSE MANY MANY MANY EXCELLENT STORIES HAVE ALL THOSE FEATURES I CAN RECALL SPECIFIC PASSAGES IN THOSE BOOKS TO THIS DAY THAT MADE ME FEEL SOMETHING IN MY BODY A I'M ACTUALLY VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE SENSATION OF HAVING CHILLS GO UP MY SPINE A SUPPOSE TO DOWN MY SPINE THE EARLY HONOR IVE REALIZE OTHER SORT OF A DIFFERENT SOMETIMES THAT TRAVELS UP MY SPONDS ON IGI I SEWDOM DISTINGUISH WHAT WHAT THAT ORIENCE ME TO OR AWAY FROM BUT BUT IT'S A VERY AMSALIENT MEMORY AND EXPERIENCE FOR  ME TO THIS DAY SO MUCH SO THE ASM DESCRIBING THE BOOK WHERE THE REDFERN GROWS RIGHT NOW I CAN CANFFEL IT IS FARTING YEI'VE HEARD YOU SAY BEFORE AND AND I LOVE THIS QUOTE AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET ATTRIBUTION FOR THIS NOT ME THAT WE BUSILY HAVE A BRAIN TO CONTROL OUR BODY WHAT IS THE THE ROLE OF THE BRAIN IN CONTROL ING THE BODY AND DO YOU THINK THAT THERE ARE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF WAYS IN WHICH OUR BRAIN DOES AT OR ARE WE REALLY TALKING ABOUT A LANGUAGE BETWEEN BRAIN AND BODY OF YOU KNOW TINGLES ON THE BACK OF OUR NECK THO GO UP TINGLES ON THE BACK OF OUR NECK THAT GO DOWN STOMACH FEELING CANNATITE AND MAKING US CRINGE AWAY OR KIND OF WARM AND WANTING TO APPROACHING IN OTHER WORDS DO YOU THINK THAT THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE BRAIN AND BODY IS PRIMITIVE SOPHISTICATED HOW NEU ANTS IS IT BECAUSE A LANGUAGE IS VERY NEWANTS WE CATT HIM UP WITH FIFTY WORDS JUST IN ENGLISH FOR THE STATE OF BEING HAPPY YE BUT THE FEELING OF BEING HAPPY I EXPERIENCE ALONG A CONTINUUM OF A LITTLE BHAPPY TO ELATED BUT IT'S IT'S GOT ONE THING REALLY SO IF IF YOU WOULD COULD YOU COMMENT ON THIS NOTION OF THE BRAIN BEING THE ORGAN THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTROLLING THE BODY AND WHAT THAT DIALOGUE IS LIKE WHAT THE SYLLABLES AND CONSONANCE OF IT ARE LIKE PERHAPS NOT AT THE LEVEL OF BIOLOGY BUT I'M AT THE LEVEL OF PSYCHOLOGYE AND HOW WE SUBJECTIVELY EXPERIENCE THAT SIR SO THE FIRST THING I'LL SAY IS THAT I LEARNED THAT IDEA FROM IT FROM WORKING WITH ANTONIA TOMASIA SO A HE WAS MY POSTDOCTRAL MANTARA AND HE TAUGHT ME FIRST THAT A THIS NOTION THAT THAT THAT IT'S THE FEELING OF THE BODY IT'S IT'S AN ORGANISM'S ABILITY TO REPRESENT OR MAP THE STATE OF THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR OF THE BODY THAT BECOMES THE SUBSTRATE FOR CONSCIOUSNESS AND FOR THE MIND AM SO I WOULD DSTONT TO GIVE HYMCREDIT BECAUSE I DID I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT FIRST BUT THE WORK THAT I'VE BEEN DOING IS AN ELABORATION OF THAT IT'S IT'S BASICALLY ADDRESSING EXACTLY THE QUESTION THAT YOUR ASKING WHICH IS HOW IS IT THAT WE CONSTRUCT A NARRATIVE CONSTRUCT A CONSCIOUS FEELING WHICH THAT WORD I TAKE FROM ANTONIA ANJANA RIT DO MASIO HOW IS IT THAT WE CONSTRUCT A FEELING AND SUTOV NARROTISES THAT FEELING ELABORATE THAT FEELING IN T TO SOMETHING THAT FEELS LIKE A NARRATIVE THAT FEELS LIKE A BELIEF STATE OR AN EMOTION STATE OR AN EXPERIENCE I MEAN THAT IN A VERY VERB LIKE WAY AND AM AND WHAT IS THE ROLE OF EMBODIMENT IN THAT WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE BRAIN AND THAT A AND AND WHAT ALSO IS THE ROLE OF THE CULTURE AND THE CULTURAL CONTEXTS TAND OTHER PEOPLE AN THAT BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE REALLY LEARNING ACROSS THE SCIENCES RIGHT NOW IS JUST HOW INCREDIBLY SOCIAL AND INTERDEPENDENT OUR SPECIES IS I MEAN ARE BIOLOGY IS INHERENTLY A SOCIAL ONE WE ARE DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON OTHER PEOPLE FOR THE FORMULATION OF OUR OWN SENSE OF SELF AND WE INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER AND CONSTRUCT AND CO CONSTRUCT A A SENSE OF SELF AND A SENSE OF MEANING VIA THOSE CULTURAL SPACES AND THOSE SORT OF AM NEW ANTS WAYS OF ACCOMMODATING EACH OTHER MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY THAT THAT LEAD TO THE FEELING OF US SO YOU KNOW BACK TO YOUR ORIGINAL QUESTION THERE'S A LOT WE DON'T KNOW THERE A BUT I THINK WHAT'S VERY CLEAR IS THAT THE KIND OF BACKROUND SENSE OF THE BODY THE MAPPING AND THE REGULATION OF THE BODY IS A A BASIC SUBSTRAIT A KIND OF OF TRAMPLING FOR THE MIND AND SO WE AR MANAGING OUR SURVIVAL YOU KNOW WE NOW HAVE LOTS OF EVIDENCE FROM ACROSS MANY KINDS OF SCIENCE ABOUT THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF OUR STRESS AND SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS AND AR IMMUNITY AND OUR RIGHT AND AND OUR ABILITY TO DIGEST FOOD AND AND IT'S EVEN NOW VERY CLEAR THAT IS NOT EVEN JUST US THERE'S A AWHOLE MICROBIOM AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER ORGANISMS THAT ARE ASSISTING US AN THAT AND THAT ARE COLLABORATING WITH US AND THAT  AND THEN THE BRAIN IS IS A IS A SPECIALIZED ORGAN OF THE BODY IN FACT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A SEPARATE THING IT'S IT'S AN OUTGROWTH OR AN ELABORATION OF THAT PROCESS IT'S A SPECIALIZATION OF THAT PROCESS A LOCALIZATION OF IT AM IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES ENOUGH PROCESSING POWER TO BE ABLE TO REALLY CONSTRUCT A ALL KINDS OF FEELINGS AND MENTAL STATES AND BELIEFS AND IMAGININGS YOU KNOW UM OUT OF OUT OF BASICALLY JUST HE FEELING OF BEING HERE AND THEN THE AMAZING PART IS THAT OUR BRAIN IS ALSO IMPOSING THOSE BACK DOWN ON TO OUR BODY SO THE WAY IN WHICH OUR BODY REACTS AM AND IS MODULATED IN RESPONSE TO MENTAL STATES IS ALSO VERY REAL SO WE HAVE A KIND OF LIKE A DYNAMIC A CONVERSATION HAPPENING THAT'S HAPPENING IN VERY BRAW AND AND DIRECT WAYS CANT NARROW CHEMICALLY ANOTHERS AND ALSO IN BROADER LONGER TERM SLOWER FLUCTUATING PATTERNS AROUND YOU KNOW OTHER KINDS OF FORMONALS CHANGES AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO LONG MULTIPLE TIME SCALE SIMULTANEOUSLY WE HAVE A KIND OF WHOLE RIGHT A HUMAN IS TIC HOL OF BRAIN AND BODY AND MIND THAT ARE KIND OF CO CONJURING ONE ANOTHER IN REAL TIME AND THAT LEADS TO ALL KINDS OF DYNAMIC POSSIBILITY SPACES FOR HOW WE ARE AND HOW WE FEEL AS WE GROW THROUGH TIME AND I THINK AS HUMANS THE LEGACY OF OUR INTELLIGENCE IS TO TAP INTO THOSE POSSIBILITY SPACES AND START TO CONSTRUCT THEM INTO MEANING FULL MEANINGFUL SORT OF CHAINS OF IDEAS CHAINS OF EXPERIENCES OVER TIME THAT WE CALL STORY AND THAT I THINK IS WHAT YOU WERE TAPPING INTO AS A LITTLE BOY YOU WERE HUNGRY FOR FODDER FOR FOR A KIND OF STRUCTURE FOR THOSE FEELINGS THAT YOU COULD START TO HELP THEM EVOLVE FROM ONE INTO THE OTHER AND CHAIN THEM TOGETHER IN WAYS THAT PRODUCE MEANING I'M FASTENING BY THE IDEA THAT EARLY IN LIFE WE EXPERIENCE SOME INTERACTION WITH THE WORLD IT COULD BE WITH OTHER PEOPLE COULD BE WITH AN OBJECT IN THE WORLD AND IT MAKES US FEEL SOMETHING POWERFUL YET AND THAT LAYS IT A TEMPLET FOR OF OF RECOGNITION MEANING THAT LATER IN LIFE AND PERHAPS THROUGHOUT LIFE WE'RE ALWAYS CONSCIOUSLY YOUR SO CONSCIOUSLY GOING BACK TO TRYING TO EXPERIENCE THAT SAME KIND OF AWE WERE INSPIRATION IM BECAUSE AGAIN THAT THE WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ALMOST CERTAINLY VERY FROM BEING A FIVE YEAR OLD TO BEING ADOLESCING AT AN INTO ADULTHOOD INTO THE I GUESS JERIATRIC YEARS DO THEY STILL CALL IT THAT IMCOLETEDDED I VOLU TINPLETICALLY IN CORRECT TERM BUT FORGIVE ME I VINSEVENTY FIVE TO TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE I AND YET HTHE FEELING IS THE SAME RIGHT YO FELING AND SO IT'S AS IF A WORD CAN MEAN THE SAME THING BUT BE USED FIFTY DIFFERENT WAYS MAY BE FIVE THOUSAND DIFFERENT WAYS TORA IT IN IN THIS ANALOGY I'M SAYING THAT AT THE WORD IS THE FEELING AND YOU KNOW AND IT'S USED SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS BECAUSE IM OCCASIONALLY I'LL READ A A SCIENTIFIC MANUSCRIPT THAT IS SO COOL YAT'S THE SAME WAY THAT I FEEL YES WHEN I WAS NINE YEARS OL O AND I AN ALL MY TIME I HAD PAT STORE LOOKING AT TROPICAL FISH AND TROPICAL BIRDS AND THACTING WHEN I GOT THAT FRESH WATER DISCOUS FISH IS THE COOLEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN YE AND AGAIN I I THINK I MUST HAVE A STRONG MEMORY FOR THESE KINDS OF THINGS YE BECAUSE I STILL I FEEL IT RIGHT NOW IN MY BODY O IT'S AS IF THE THE SAME THING MAPS TO SO MANY DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES SO IS WHAT WE'RE LEARNING ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN A RECOGNITION OF FEELINGS IN OUR BODY AS AH THIS IS SOMETHING I LIKE BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT MAKES MY BODY FEEL OR IS IT COGNITIVE OR BOTH ITFROM YOUR ANSWER A MOMENT AGO IT SEEMS I GET SO INTERCONNECTED AND BY DIRECTIONAL AND FAST THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO REALLY SAY THAT FEELINGS ARE IN THE BODY OR IN THE BRAIN IT'S REALLY AMHAPPENING SIM AND NEXTLY THAT'S A DYNAMIC EMERGENC STA THEY GIVE MAN EXAMPLE SO THAT I IS SOMETIMES TO HELP MYSELF UNDERSTAND A NOTION SO I YOU KNOW MI LOLD MY LITTLE DAUGHTER OQ NORA ONE SHE WAS TOO TWO AND SOME MONTHS TO INFORM ONTSOF IT THAT SHE'S VERY VERBALCID AND I I WAS SITTING IN THE KITCHEN ONE DAY DRINKING A CUP OF TEA I WAS SAD ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN MY LIFE BUT I AIN'T I WASN'T WEEPING WRINYTHING I' JUST SITTING THERE I MUST A LOOKED KIND OF YOU I LOST IN MY OWN THOUGHTS SHE'S PLAYING AROUND ON THE FLOOR SHE CAME OVER TO ME I'LL NEVER FORGET AT THIS TINY LITTLE PERSON SHE COMES OVER ME AND NOTICE T I WASN'T REALLY THERE WITH HER YOU KNOW IT I MEAN AND SHE MY ARM MUST HANGIN DOWN SHE PICKED UP MY ARM AND SHE HOLD IT AGAINST YOUR FACE LIKE THAT AND SHE SAID I WON'T SAY A BABY TALK AS YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND ME SHE SAID DON'T WORRY MAMMA I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU AND I SAID YET AND I DO NOR THAT'S SO THAT'S SO SWEET SWEDIA I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU TOO AND SHE SAID AND MAMMA I WILL WE LOVE YOU I REALLY LOVE YOU AND THEN SHE SAID I MEAN I REALLY LOVE YO AM I REALLY LOVE YOUR ARM MAER RAY FAST FORWARD TWO YEARS LATER ALMOST EXACTLY TO YOU SHE'S FOR IND A COUPLE MONTHS AND SHE WASN'T BED ONE NIGHT LAYIND IN HER BED IN THE DARK AND I WALKED BY AND I LISTENED AT THE DOOR TO SEE IF SHE WAS ASLEEPING THRE AND I HEAR THIS LITTLE WHISPER COMES OUT AND SHE SAYS MAMMA I LOVE YOU MORE THAN I'M GLAD THAT THERE'S DAY TIME WHAT'S CHANGED DEVELOPMENTALLY FROM HER AT H TO TO HER AT H FOR RIT I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SUBSTRAT OF HER ATTACHMENT TO HER MOTHER IS PROBABLY QUITE SIMILAR SHE HAD THIS SORT OF VISERAL AUTOMATIC BIALOGICAL YOU MIGHT SAY ATTACHMENT CONNECTION TO ME EMOTIONALLY THAT SHE WAS TRYING TO LEVERADGE IN THE SERVICE OF MAKING SENSE OF YOU NO'T BEING ACTIVE IN THAT WORLD AND ADAPTING HERSELF TO THE SITUATION HELPING ME IN THE FIRST CASE  BUT WHAT'S CHANGED REMARKABLY IS NOT THE SUBSTRAIT OF THAT ATTACHMENT IT'S HER ABILITY TO CONCEPTIOALIZE IT AND WHEN SHE'S TOO HER LOVE IS EXPERIENCED AS IS INCREDIBLY CONCRETE EMBODIED REAL PHYSICAL THING LIKE I LOVE YOU I MEAN I REALLY LOVE THE BODY PART I AM CURTLY SMUSHING AGAINST MY FACE RIHT WHERE IS TWO YEARS LATER SHE CAN CONCEPTIOLIZE THAT LOVE IN TERMS OF AN IDEA WHICH IS YOU KNOW WOULDN'T IT BE AWFUL IF THERE WAS NIGHT TIME ALL THE TIME AND THERE WAS NO SUNSHINE AND DAYLIGHT AND I COULDN'T GO OUT TO PLAY AND I COULD WRITE YEN YOU'RE DESCRIBING MY BIGGEST PHERA AT PEOPLE LISTENER TO THIS PODGUT I'M GOING TO GO INTO THE GRAVE HOOFULLY A LONG TIME FROM NOW YA TELLING PEOPLE TO GET MORNING SOMELIGH E O I O OIN AN OTINO BUT IT PLEASE CONTINUE NO BUT THAT'S RIGHT SO SHE'S THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH SHE IS GRATEFUL FOR THEIRE TO BE SUNLIGHT AND IN HER LITTLE MIND SHE CONNECTED THAT TO THE FEELING OF BEING ATTACHED TO ME AND USED ONE TO EXPLAIN THE OTHER WRITE SO THAT BOTH THINGS NOW HAVE MEANING AND THAT IS THE WAY THAT IS THE WAY I THINK THAT WE START TO ELABORATE THESE VERY BASIC PHYSIOLOGICAL ATTACHMENT STATES AVERSION STATES RITE MOTIVATIONAL STATES A VERIOUS SORTS INTO MENTAL STATES BELIEFS POEMS YOU KNOW I LOVE SONGS ALL THE THINGS THAT SHE DOES RIGHT EVEN BETWEEN AGE TWO AND AGE FOR THAT REALLY ARE MENTAL ELABORATIONS MEANING MAKING OF THAT VERY PHYSIOLOGICALLY BASIC SENSATION DOES IT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IIT ANSWERS IT INCREDIBLY CLEARLY IN SO MUCH SO THAT I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THAT YESAMPLE UM BECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY RELATABLE FOR PEOPLE AND IT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT I'VE EVER HEARD THE EMBODIMENT OF EMOTIONS DESCRIBED IN A DEVELOPMENTAL REMARK THAT TRULY MAKE SENSE  IM SO THANK YOU SO THE CONTACT WITH YOUR ARM WERE YOUR ARM OR BOTH A WAS THE THE WAS THE LIFE EXAMPLE THAT SHE WAS USING IT AS A TWO YEAR OLD THAT MAPS TO AN INTERNAL FEELING AND AN ORGAN A ASSUME SHE'S NOT HERE WE DON'T HAVE HER IN A BRAIN SCANNER WE CAN'T ASK HER BUT WERDANT ASSUME THAT HER EXPERIENCE OF A BEING PUT TO BED AT NIGHT AND AND FEELING SO SO MUCH LOVE FROM AND FOR YOU MAP TO HER THEN A GROWING UNDERSTANDING OF THE THE WORLD AROUND HER THE FACT THE THURSDAY AND NIGHT AND SUNSHINNE O AS HER KNOWLEDGE BASE GROWS YSHE CAN ADD EXAMPLES TO THE FEELING AND I'M ASSUMING THAT AM DOESN'T MATTER HOW OLD SHE IS NOW BUT I'M ASSUMING THAT AS A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD THE KNOWLEDGE BASIS CAN BE DIFFERENT AND IS GOING TO MAP TO THAT FEELING AGAIN AND AGAIN SO THE QUESTION IS IS WHAT WE ARE DOING ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN IS RECOGNIZING AM SORT OF I DONT ANT TO CALL THEM PRIMITIVES BUT A BASIC EMOTIONAL STATES WHICH ARE NOT INFINITE BUT CAN BE ALONG A EACH ONE ALONG A CONTINUUM SO A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE COMPLETELY IN LOVE E ALONG CONTINUE THAN EVERYTHING BETWEEN AM A LITTLE ANGRY AND ANNOYED TO COMPLETELY FURIOUS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT MAY BE AM TEN TO THIRTY CORE EMOTIONS THAT THEN WE ARE JUST SIMPLY BINNING OUR EXPERIENCES INTO AND ON TO AND MAPYON TO AND THEN THAT'S OUR LIFE STORY AND I'M NOT TRYING OVER SIMPLIFY THINGS BUT AM THAT SEEMS TO ME LIKE PRETTY GREAT WAY FOR A NERVOUS SYSTEM TO NAVIGATE A A WORLD THAT IS INFINITELY COMPLEX YET AND HAS A LOT OF SURPRISE BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AND IN WHICH LIKE EVERY ORGANISM OUR MAINGOAL IS TO SURVIVE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AND NOT FOR EVERYBODY BUT IN MANY CASES TO TRYING  MAKE MORE OF OURSELVES I MEAN THOSE SOM TO BE THE BASI DRIVE SURVIVE AND MAKE MORE OF ONE'SELF AS SOOMS TO BE THE TWO BASIC FUNCTION  TEVR THE VERY IDEAS OR MORE OF YOUR WORK SOURE OF YOUR ART EXACTLY TEM SO IS THAT IN IN O REALLY SIMPLICIC WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT OR DOES IT DOES IT WORK EVEN IF THERE'S MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDED DOES THAT WORK IS A TWENTY YEAR OLD I' LEARN THINGS IN COLLEGE ON LIKE THIS IS ASOMYET THE FIRST TIME I LEARNED ABOUT THE HYPOTHLEMIS THIS MARBLE SIZE STRUCTURE IN THE FACT THAT DIFFERENT NER ON SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER CAN PUT US INTO A RAGE WERE WE'LL MAKE US WANT O MATE OR WE'LL MAKE US THIRSTY OR HUNGRY OR TIRED IV  WHY YES I D I MEAN IT JUST IT BLOOMY AWAY IT STILL BLOWS ME AWAY YET BUT THE FEELING S THE SAME AS LOOKING AT THE DISCUSPICION THAT IN YONA'S PET SHOP ON CALIFORNIA ANNUONE IM NINE YEARS OLD SOIS THAT THE WAY I THINK ATOTHER NIHT I THINK YES I THINK THERE IS THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF BASIC PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT ARE THAT BECOME MOTIVATIONAL MECHANISMS RIGHT AND IN ALL THE SENSES A ADAPTIVE MECHANISMS THAT WE SHARE WITH ALL LIFE FORMS NOT EVEN TO STALL ANIMALS THAT ALL LIFE FORMS BUT THEY LOOK DIFFERENT AND DIFERENT LIFE FORMS FOR SURE BECAUSE THE ADAPTOV FUNCTIONS THE TIME SCALES AND EVERYTHING ARE DIFFERENT IF YOU'RE A TREE THAN IF YOU ARE FISH THAN IF YOU ARE SLIME OULD OR YOUR ME RIGHT BUT I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT WHAT WE BASICALLY OUR DOING IS TAKING THESE VERY PRIMITIVE PHYSIOLOGICAL REGULATORY CAPACITIES THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY THERE TO KEEP YOU ALIVE AND AND THAT'S A VERY DYNAMIC THING TO KEEP YOU ALIVE YOU HAVE TO CONSTALATE ADJUST FOR THE THE NEEDS OF THE INTERNAL ORGANISM THE NEEDS OF THE EXTERNAL YOU DON'THATHE MANS OF THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT ON THAT ORGANISM AND BEING ABLE TO MANAGE IN THAT SPACE OVER TIME IS A VERY COMPLEX DYNAMIC IM KIND OF KIND OF ITERATIVE PROCESS AND WE TAKE THOSE PROCESSES AND WE CONJURE OUT OF THEM A FORM OF CONSCIOUSNESS AN AWARENESS OF THOSE PROCESSIES THAT BECOMES SOMETHING THAT FEELS MENTALLY POWERFUL TO US AND AND I THINK ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN KNOW THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS RIGHT IS THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS JUST OUR FIRST EXPERIMENT ON THIS BUT BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY POIGNANT WE WE WE FIRST STARTED TO STUDY AM THE THE WAYS PEOPLE WOULD REACT TO SOCIAL STIMULE RIGHT TO HAVE EMOTIONS LIKE COMPASSION OR OR ADMIRATION IN THAADMORIZ SKINNER AM BY TELLING PEOPLE A STORIES OF TRUE PEOPLE SITUATIONS THAT INVOKED THESE EMOTIONS IN ALL KINDS OF PILOTTING IN THE WE ASK PEOPLE HOW TO MAKE YOU FEEL THEN WE CAN SEE WHETHER THEY ACTUALLY FEEL THAT WAY AND THEN WE MOVE THEM IN THE THE AMARI SKINER AND ASK HIM AGAIN TO WATCH THE STORY INFI AND WHAT WE EXPECTED WE HAD SOME VERY BASIC HYPOTHESES THAT THINGS LIKE A'M WATCHING SOMEBODY ELSE UNDER PHYSICAL PAIN WOULD ACTIVATE THE SAME SYSTEMS IN YOUR BRAIN THAT ALLOW YOU TO FEEL PHYSICAL PAIN A AND THE SAME WITH PLEASURE A ROUND ADMIRATION FOR SKILL BY WATCHING SOMEBODY DO FLIPS ON THEIR BIKE ON A RAILROAD TIE OR WHATEVER IT IS RIGHT A OR VIRTUE WY WATCHING A CIVIL RIGTES LEADER OR SOMEBODY WHO DOES SOMETHING THAT'S INCREDIBLY VIRTUOUSLY POWERFUL BUT NOT PHYSICALLY SKILLED AM AND WE HAD A REAL SURPRISE IN THOSE FINDINGSE A WHICH I THINK REALLY WENT AGAINST THE PREVAILING NOTION OF HOW EMOTION WORKS AND WHICH IS STILL SOMETHING WHICH I RESTLE WATH TRYING TO UNDERSTAND SO WE AHYPOTHESISE THAT FEELING EMOTIONS ABOUT VERY PHYSICAL DIRECT THINGS AND FEELING EMOTIONS ABOUT ARE MI DRAWING UM IN SPACE BUT FELLING EMOTIONS ABOUT COMPLEX ELABORATED THINGS LIKE COMPASSION FOR SOME ONE HAVING LOST U SMALSE OR SOMETHING WORE YOU DON'T SEE ANY WREAL PHYSICAL PAIN BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW THEIR FEELING BASED ON YOUR SHARED EXPERIENCE AM OF LOSS RIT OR ADMIRATION FOR VIRTUE AM THAT THOSE THINGS WOULD BUILD A NURL BIOLOGICALLY THE WAY THAT THEY BUILD DEVELOPMENTALLY THE WAY THAT THEY BUILD EVOLUTIONARILY M AND WE DID FIND THAT TO B THE CASE AN MANY OTHER GROUPS IN EXPERIMENTS HAVE FOUND THAT TO BUT WHAT WAS A REAL SURPRISE TO US IS THAT EMOTIONS BASED IN PAIN AND EMOTIONS BASED IN SOMETHING REWARDING OR PLEASURABLE LIKE VIRTUE WHICH IS REALLY INSPIRING AS PEOPLE DESCRIBE IT WERE ACTUALLY RECRUITING THE SAME BRANE SYSTEMS INCLUDING THE HYPOTHALMIS RIGHT AND OTHER SYSTEMS LIKE THE ANTERIOR INSULO WHICH IS BASICALLY VICERAL SEMATOMOTOR QUARTEXS ITS QARTICS THAT FEELS THE STATE OF HOW YOUR DIGESTING YOUR LAUNCH WHETHER YOUR HEARTS POUNDING ALL THES KINDS OF THINGS RIGHT WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THESE EMOTIONS WHEN THEY GET COMPLEX WHEN THEY'RE ABOUT STORIES THE VEILANCE IS NO LONGER THE DEFINING FEATURE THE VEILANCE DOESN'T EVEN MATTER THAT MUCH INSTEAD WHAT MATTERS IS DOES THE EMOTION PERTAIN TO A STOR THAT IS CONJURED IN OUR MINDS OR DOES IT MAINLY PERTAIN TO WHAT YOU CAN DIRECTLY WITNESSED BY LOOKING AT THE PERSON SO THEY STEP OFF A CURB THEY BREAK THEIR ANKLE AND YOU GO ALL TATS I GET REALLY HEART RIGHT VERSES THERE EATING DINNER ALONE IN A RESTAURANT AND SOMEBODY TELLS YOU HIS SPOUSTIDE JUST A MONTH AGO RIGHT WHERE YOU HAVE TO TELL YOURSELF AN ENTIRE STORY ABOUT HOW HE MUST BE FEELING IN THAT SITUATION AS COMPERE TED JUST LOOKING AT HIM AND SEEING THE ANKLE AND GOING WHO YOU KNOW AND IT WAS THAT LEAP WHICH IS REALLY UNIQUELY HUMAN WHICH IS FULLY DEVELOPED REALLY THROUGHOUT A VERY PROTRACTED PERIOD RIGHT LITTLE CHILDREN DO NOT FULLY APPRECIATE THOSE KINDS OF MENTAL STATES YET RIGHT AND IN ADOLESCENCE KIDS ARE ALL ABOUT TRYING TO CONJURE AND SIMULATE THESE THINGS AND THEY DO IT VERY YEN ARE THEY OVERDO IT AND THEY DO IT IN THESE VERY SORT OF AWKWARD WAY IS THAT ADULTS RECOGNIZE AS I YOU KNOW I'D NOT LIKELY TO CORRESPOND FULLY TO REALITY RIGT MANY TIMES A AND THEN WE START TO BUILD MORE AND MORE FACILITY MORE AND MORE SORT OF WISDOM AROUND CONJURING THE STORY THAT MAKES THE MOST DIRECT PARSIMONIOUS SENSE OUT OF THE THINGS THAT YOU IMAGINE SOMEBODY ELSE MAY HAVE EXPERIENCED GIVEN THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE CONTECTS IN WHICH THEY FIND THEMSELVES IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE DYNAMIC MORE AND MORE SER INFERENTIAL AND SO THIS ALSO GOES BACK TO WHAT YOU ARE SAYING ABOUT DEVELOPMENT THIS IS ACTUALLY HOW I SEE DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LESS BY MY LITTLE TOU YEAR OLD LOVES THE ARM THEN SHE LOVES ME AS MUCH AS SOMETHING ELSE THAT SHE REALLY APPRECIATES LIKE DAYLIGHT AND THEN SHE GOES ON FROM THERE AND WHEN SHE'S EIGHTY GODWILLING SOME DAY WRITE SHE'LL BE MAKING A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY PICKING OUT THINGS THAT MATTER IN MORE SUBTLE WAYS THAT OTHER PEOPLE MAY NOT NOTICE BECAUSE OF THE HISTORICAL CONTECT BECAUSE OF HER HER MORE LIVED EXPERIENCE THAT SHE BRINGS TO THAT STORY WRITES O THE THINGS THAT BECOME SALIENT THE THINGS YOU LEARN HOW TO NOTICE AND BUILD A STORY OUT OF ARE DEVELOPMENTAL AND THERE LEARNED A CROSS TIME BUT THE BASIC FUNDAMENTAL PROCESSIES AROUND THE EMOTIONS ARE ALWAYS DRIVING THE NEED TO MAKE THE STORY AND SO JUST TO COME BACK ANSWERING WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE I THINK WE HAVE THIS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX DYNAMIC SET OF BASIC COMMOTIONS WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM PHYSIOLOGICAL STATES THAT WE SHARE WITH OTHER ORGANISMS THAT ARE BHYSICALLY ACTION PROGRAMMS THAT TEACH YOU RUN AWAY FROM THIS WRIT MOVE TOWARD THAT A EAT THIS DON'T EAT THAT RIGHTE BUT THOSE THINGS INHUMANS AND TO A LESSER DEGREE IN OTHER IN OTHER ANIMALS BECOME THE FODDER FOR NOT JUST ACTION PROGRAMMS IN THE MOMENT BUT IDEAS THAT TRANSCEND TIME IDEAS THAT BECOME THE NARRATIVES OF THE STUFF OF BELIEFS OF VALUES OF A OF IDENTITIES A THOSE MORE ETHEREOL YOU KNOW ESSENCES OF US THAT ARE CONJURED ENTIRELY BY US INCULTURAL SPACES ARE FUNDAMENTALLY GROUNDED INTO ARE ABILITY TO EXPERIENCE THE WORLD IN A REAL PHYSICAL EMBODIED SENSE BUT BUT ELABORATED FAR BEYOND T I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED  G ONE IS A VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEENS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THEREASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLTIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO ME THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GOT IS VERY IMPORTANT IS POPULATED BY GOP MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE MEAN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURN HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIOTICS AN ATHLETIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLETIC GRENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTEGINS VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTE CRIPE IF YOU' LIKE TO TRYATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD AN THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TWO AGAIND THAT'S ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMIND THREE K TO I STARTED OFF STUDYING THE VISUAL SYSTEM AND I DON'T WANT THIS TO TURN INTO A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE VISUAL SYSTEM BUT INDIVISUAL SYSTEM WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A WHAT'S CALLED THE HIARCHICAL ORGANIZATION WHERE THE EYE IN CODS AND CAN RESPOND TO EDGES AND LIGHT VERSES DARK IN RED GREEN BLUE AND FROM THAT VERY BASIC SET OF BUILDING BLOCKS THERE'S AN ELABORATION OR A BUILD UP OF WHAT'S REALLY CALLED THE ICEBERG MODEL THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY MY SCIENTIFIC GRAT GRINPARENTS DAVID HUWON' TORNTS THE WEASEL WHO ONE THE NOBLE PRIZE FOR THAT WORK WHERE YOU CAN LOOK AT SOMEBODY'S FACE AND RECOGNIZE IT OR SEE A PROFILE MOVING AT IN PARTICULAR DIRECTION AND STILL RECOG NIZE THAT PERSON OR UM SEE A WORD WRITTEN IN AND CONCEPTIONALIZE IN YOUR MIND'S EYE WHAT THAT WORD LIKE BIRD ACTUALY LOOKS LIKE LIKE PARAKEET BLUE PARAKEET IN OTHER WORD THERE'S A HIEARCHICAL BUILD UP AND WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING SOUNDS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR THAT THERE'S A HIEARCHICAL ORGANIZATION WHEREBY THROUGH DEVELOPMENT WE WE FIRST LEARN I GUESS EARLIER I CALL THEM PRIMITIVES BUT BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS OF NO WHEN SOME ONE STEPS ON MY FOOT AT HARTS CAN HURT A LOT OR A LITTLE TEN ANY ON WHO STEPPED ON MY FOOT UM WHETHEN I HAVE A SHOE ONC YOUSERT LEARNING CONTECT BUT IT THAT THERE'S A BUILD UP ON TOP OF THE BASIC SOMATIC EXPERIENCE OF DIFFERENT EXAMPLES THAT MAP TO PAIN INCLUDING EMOTIONAL PAIN AND PHYSICAL PAIN BECAUSE WE KNOW THOSE ARE INTERGEGITATED SOMEWHAT UM AND THAT OVER TIME THIS BUILDS UP SO THAT WE HAVE YOU'LL COUNTLESS EXAMPLES BUT YOU ADD IT YOU SAID SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S THAT GOES BEYOND THA THE HIERARCHICAL ORGANIZATION TAT WE SEEN THE VISUAL SYSTEM WHICH IS THAT WHEN THERE'S A NARRATIVE OR A STORY THAT WE HAVE TO ADD IT CHANGES SOMETHING ABOUT THE REPRESENTATION OF EMOTION I'M I'M SO STRUCK BY THIS BY THIS I'M COMPARISON BETWEEN SEEING SOMEBODY STEP OFF A CURB AND BREAK THEIR ANKLE LIKE EVEN AS I'M DESCRIBED JUST LIKE A FLYING ANGLE LIKE OUCH YET I REA YOU LOOK IT WAT YOU DO IT YOUR FACE INTO DA HARTY A I'VE BROKE MY IE BROKEN MY LEFT FOOT FIVE TIMES COYING UP DOING THE SAME SPORT AND JUST I CAN STILL HERE AND FEEL THE THING GOING AT MEAN SIX MONTHS IN A CAST OR WHATEVER IT IS VERSES A STORY YOU AVE SEEING SOMEBODY SITTING ALONE IN A CAFE WRITING IN THEIR JOURNAL AND THEN YOU LEARNING THAT THEY JUST LOST THEIR SPOUSE OF SEVENTY FIVE YEARS IT TWO FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT VISUAL IMAGES THE EMOTION COULD PERHAPS BE THE SAME LIKE AH YES THAT IS ROUGH AND YET THE NEED TO IMPOSE STORY YES CHIT CHANGES DO I UNDERSTAND THAT CURLY THAT THERE'S SOMETHING NOT JUS MORE AN DEVELOPMENTALLY MATURE ABOUT ADDING IN STORY AND ADDING CONTEXT BUT THAT WHEN WE HAVE TO DO THAT THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT ABOUT HOW THE EMOTIONS ARE MAPPED IN THE BRAIN IT I GUESS THE PERHAPS THE THE ANSE FROM LOOKING FOR IS WHAT DID YOU SEE IN BRAIN SKANNING EXPERIMENTS WE'RE SOMEBODY VIEWS A SIMPLY A PHYSICAL BREAK OF A SOMEBODY LIM VERSES SOMEBODY HAS TO ADD STORY IS THERE'S SOMETHING THAT AN THAT COMES OUT IN THE SUBTRACTION OF ONE FROM THE OTHER THAT TELLS US OH A HA WHOLE SET OF BRAIN THAT WORKS THAT ARE NOT JUST ABOUT SAYING OUCH YES BUT THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE NEED TO CONTRA UPT STORY IN WHAT ONE OF THOSE BRAIN AREAS AND THE PERHAPS WE CAN WE CAN UM YET DE DIGECTHOS A LITTLE BIT YES AND ACTUALLY THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE FOUND A WHOLE SYSTEM OF BRAIN AREAS THAT THAT DID THIS WHICH NOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE DESCRIBED AND WERE STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL ROLE OF THESE NATWORKS BUT YOU KNOW IM THESE REGIONS TOGETHER ARE CALLED IN THE LITERATURE THE SO CALLED DEFAULT MODE NETWORK RIGHT BECAUSE THEY WERE THESE DID THE COACTIVATION OF THESE CHARACTERISTIC REGIONS OF THE BRAIN WHICH ARE IN THE BACK MIDDLE OF THE HEAD AND SOME CHARACTERISTIC REGIONS ON THE LATERAL BRIDAL AND YOU KNOW AM YOU KNOW THOSE WERE FIRST DESCRIBED I IN NOUR IMAGING EXPERIMENT WEAR PEOPLE WERE ASKED TO JUST REST RIGHT REST AND RELAX SOMETHING ABOUT ANYTHING JUST CLEAR YOUR MIND FOR A FEW MINUTES TRITE THIS IS MARK AS RACAL ON HIS COLLEAGUES BACK IND TWO THOUSAND ONE AM AND THEN AND THEN CONTRASTING THAT WITH IM I TASKS WHEN PEOPLE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING VERY YOU KNOW ATTENTION FOCUS REQUIRING WOR YOU REALLY HAVE TO WORK HART AND THINK AND THEY FOUND THAT THESE HIGHLY METABOLIC CHARACTERISTIC REGIONS OF THE BRAIN WORE COMING ON MINE AND ACTIVATING THEMSELVES WHEN THE PERSON WAS RESTING AND DEACTIVATING AND D E COUPLING FROM ONE ANOTHER NOT TALKING BACK AND FORTH IN EXCHANGING SIGNAL VERY MUCH AM WHEN SOMEONE WAS DOING A REALLY EFFORTFUL MENTAL TASK AND THAT WAS A REAL CONUNDRUM FOR A LONG TIME AND WHAT WE NOW KNOW IS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ASK SOMEBODY TO THINK ABOUT NOTHING OR REST NOW FOR A FEW MINUTES YOU'RE LANG IN THE SKAN OF THING ATHING ABBO NOTHING OTHNG NONOTHING AND THEN YOU START DAY DREAMING ABOUT ALL MANNER OF STORIES YOU START TO IMAGINE YOURSELF INTO THE FUTURE HER AM WHEN IN NOEN BIC TO I YOU KNOW OR AS MY GRANDMOTHER'S BIRTHAY NEXT WE GI WOENDER IF SHOULD LIKE TO GO ALON SOR IF SHE'D RATHER HAVE FLOWERS YOU KYOU'RE IMAGINING OTHER PEOPLE'S MIND STATES YOU'RE THINKING I MATAM IT WERE YOU KNOW OR I WONDER IF I SHOULD YOUNA CHANGE OBS YOU KNOWYOU'RE THINKING ABOUT ALL KINDS OF POSSIBLE SPACES THAT DON'T ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY EXISTS IN THE REAL HERE AND NOW AND AND SO WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT ARE OUR FINDINGS WERE I THINK SOME OF THE FIRST IF NOT THE FIRST TO TO A ACTIVELY DEMANSTRATE AND INCREASE IN ACTIVATION IN THESE DEFAULT MODE SYSTEMS NOT A DECOUPLING OF THEM BUT AN ACTIVATION OF THEM WHEN WE ASK SOMEBODY TO DO AN EFFORTFULL MENTAL TASK AND WHAT WAS THE TASK ASKING PEOPLE HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS STORY WHICH INVOLVES A LOT OF IMPOSING OF CULTURAL AND SOCIONAL AN CONTECTIONAL KNOWLEDGE TO BE ABLE TO APPRECIATE SO THE STORY OF THE GUIVE SITTING IN THE CAFE WRITING IN HIS JOURNAL AH WHO LOST THIS SPOUSE OF SEVENTY FIVE YEARS YOU HAVE TO KNOW A LOT TO BE ABLE TO APPRECIATE HOW HE MUST BE FEELING HOW DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL WHET ME PULL UP A LOT OF RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AND MEMORIES AND THEN HYPOTHESIZED GENERATE SOME KIND OF A NARRATIVE SOME KIND OF STORY LINE THAT WOULD ACCOMMODATE HIS SITUATION AND ALLOW ME TO INFER THOSE KINDS OF STORIES WHICH ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM YOU'RE SOMEBODY STEPPING OFF THE CURB HOW LOOK AT THAT ANKLE RIGHT IT'S VERY OBVIOUS HOW YOU SHOULD OW THAT MAKES THE PERSON FEELIN HOW YOU SHOULD FEEL ABOUT THAT YOU DON'T REALLY NEEDS TO BRING A WHOLE LOT OF CULTURAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THEIR YOU PERSONAL HISTORY WITH THEIR SPOUSE TO YE LL UNDERSTAND THAT 'S BREAKING YOUR ANKLE HEARTS RIHT AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT IT WAS THOSE KINDS OF STORIES WHERE PEOPLE HAD TO BRING A LOT OF CONTECTUAL KNOWLEDGE TO FULLY APPRECIATE THAT ACTIVATED THESE DEFAULT MODE SYSTEMS THISPOUT THE LOSING OF THE SPOOSING OF THE SPOUS SO WHAT WE LEATER SHOWED IN A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS A CONTRASTING AS TRUE STORIES THAT ARE MEANT TO INDUCE ADMIRATION FOR SKILL RIGHT LIKE SOMETHING PHYSICALLY SKILFUL SOME MIT CAN OR COGNITABLY SKILFUL NDMEMORIZEA RUBIC'S CLUBE AND SOLVE IT WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED RIGHT OR DO FLIPS ON YOUR BICYCLE AND LAND ON A RAILROAD TIE RIGHT LIKE THESE INCREDIBLY SKILFUL THINGS A AS COMPARED TO I I THE SAME KIND OF BASIC EMOTION IN THE SENSE OF FEELING LIKE INSPIRED A LIKE ATTRACTED TO IT LIKE IT'S PLEASURABLE LIKE IT'S REALLY COOL LIKE YOU WISH YOU CULD DO THAT TOO BUT NOW IT'S ABOUT A STATE OF THAT PERSONS MIND OR QUALITY OF CHARACTER OR DISPOSITION OF SELF SO TALKING ABOUT THE INCREDIBLY BRAVE A ACTIONS OF MULALLA IN PACKASTAND STANDING UP TO THE PAT TO THE TO THE TOLLY BOTTON RIGHT WHERE IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW WELL SHE WALKS DOWN THE STREET HOLDING HER SCHOOL BOOK THERE'S NOTHING REALLY PHYSICALLY SKILFUL TO SEE THERE IT'S ABOUT THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH SHE'S DOING IT AND WHAT YOU CAN INFER ABOUT HER STATE OF MIND AND HER QUALITY OF CHARACTER TO BE ENGAGING IN THESE ACTIONS UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS AND THOSE COMPLEX KINDS OF INFERENCES WE FOUND A ACTIVATE THESE DEFAULTMODE SYSTEMS UNIQUELY IN EFFECT WE CAN IN TRIAL BY TRIAL EXPERIMENTS SO LITERALLY DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT A STORY WHETHER IT INSPIRES YOU THAT PARTICULAR STORY OUT OF FIFTY RIGHT IN A TWO HOUR INTERVIEW BEFOREHAND IF YOU ARE INSPIRED BY A PARTICULAR STORY AS COMPARED TO ANOTHR ON LICH MAY NOT RESINATE WITH YOU RIGHT UM THEN WHEN WE PUT YOU IN THE AMARISKANNER WE CAN PREDICT THAT YOU WILL ACTUALLY ACTIVEATE THESE NARAL SYSTEMS DIFFERENTIALLY BASED ON YOUR PSYCHOLOGICAL REACTION IN THE INTERVIEW SO WE CAN ACTUALLY SHOW THAT THERE ARE SYSTEMATIC WAYS IN WHICH THESE LARGE SCALE NATWORKS OID THE BRAIN SO THE WAY IN WHICH THE BRAINS KIND OF BALANCING ITS ACTIVITY IN ITS CROSS TALK AROUND THE DIFFERENT PARTS THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING DIFERENT KINDS OF PROCESSING THOSE DYNAMIC BALANCES ARE ARE DIFFERENT WHEN SOME ONE IS WHAT WERE DOING WHAT WE'RE CALLING OUT TRANSCENDING THE SITUATION OF THAT PERSON RIGHT AND STARTING TO LEARN SOMETHING BIGGER ABOUT WHAT IT ALL MEANS OR WHAT THE STORY IS OR THE THE BROADER REASON WHY THIS INSPIRES ME UM AND NOT JUST IS ABOUT HUR RIGHT SO YOU CAN LOOK AT MULALLA AND YOU CAN SAY YOU KNOW OH I I I HOPE SHE MAKES IT THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S REALLY UNFAIR AND I  AN LIKE RIGHT OR YOU CAN LOOK AT HER INSAYAN CAN SAY THIS TO US AND EXPERIMENTS WITH TEAN AGERS UM BUT WAIT A MINUTE AND THEY ACTUALLY WAIT THEY COVER THEIR FACE THEY CLOSE THEIR EYES THEY LOOK AWAY FROM THE FROM THE MULALL OF IT YO AND THY LOOK AT THE PLAIN SICEILING AND WE CAN ACTUALLY GET COTERS WITH THE VOLUME OFF TO IDENTIFY THESE PERIODS OF TIME AND SAY THAT WHEN THEY COME BACK FROM THAT PAUS THEIR SPEECHLOWS THEIR THEIR POSTURES CLOSES READ THY PUT THEIR HANDS DOWN THAT KIND OF THING THEY DON'T GESTURE RIGHT AND WHEN THEY COME BACK FROM THAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT TWO THINGS THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BROADER INFERENTIAL NARRATIVE AROUND WHAT ALL THIS MEANS WAIT I DIDN'T KNOW NOT EVERYBODY N THE WORLD TDOESN'T GET TO GO TO SCANOR GETS TO GO TO SCHOOL YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT RIGHT RIGHT AND AND THESE ETHICAL INTERPRETATIONS THAT'S NOT RIGHT AND THE THIRD THING THAT COMES UP IS A FEELING OF SELF AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE USING YOUR OWN SELF AND CONSCIOUSNESS IS A KIND OF SPRINGBOARD LIKE A TRAMPLING LIKE WE SAID BEFORE TO TRY TO APPRECIATE WHAT IT MUST BE LIKE TO BE HER SO THE NEXT THING PEOPLE SAY TO US OR CID SAY TO US ESPECIALLY AS IT MAKES ME REALIZE THAT I GO TO SCHOOL ALL THE TIME AND I CINE T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED AND MAYBE I SHOULD WORK HARTARDS TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT FOR OTHER PEOPLE YOU KNOW SO WE HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE CONFLUENCE IN THE BRAIN AND MIND THIS LAYRING OF OF OF REAL PHYSICAL ACTIONS AND THINGS THAT HAPPEN THAT YOU CAN DIRECTLY OBSERVE WITH THE VISUAL I SYSTEM  IN THE WORLD AND THN YOU IMPOSE UPON THOSE A A DESIRE TO CONSTRUCT A STORY OR MEANING AND YOU ELABORATE THAT MEANING AND IN DOING SO YOU ALSO RAMP OP THE INTERNAL SENSE OF SELF AWARENESS OF ME BEING ME OF CONSCIOUS SYSTEMS SUC SYSTEMS AS SUPPORT CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE BRAIN AND BRAIN STAM VERY BASIC THINGS WE SURE WITH ALLIGATORS RIGHT THAT BECOME THAT KIND OF INSPIRED STATE OF YOU KNOW LIKE WAIT IT MAKES ME WANT TO DO MORE FOR THE WORLD OR IT MAKES ME INSPIRED TO KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE HER OR SHE GIVES ME HOPE FOR HUMANITY ONE CAN TOLD ME RIGHT SO WE'VE GOT THIS INCREDIBLE DYNAMIC LAYERING OF THE FEELING OF THE BODY THE REAL PHYSICAL BODY THE OBSERVATION AND SENSATION PERCEPTION OF THE WORLD AROUND US IN OF PHYSICAL REAL OR SOCIAL REAL SENSE AND THAN THE ELABORATION OF THAT INTO THESE CULTURAL NARRATIVE THAT BECOME FEELING STATES AND WHERE VAILANCE KINDS OF DISAPPEARS RIGHT IT DOESN'T MATTER SO MUCH ANY MORE WHETHER IT'S PAINFUL OR PLEASURABLE IT'S MORE ABOUT DESNT MEANS SOMETHING I'M SUFFERING BECAUSE IT'S HELPING SOME ONE ELSE RIGHT IN SO IT BECOMES SOMETHING DESIRABLE EVEN THOUGH IT HURTS ME RIGHT OTHERWISE NONE OF US WOULD GO THROUGH CHILDER AND SO IT'S THAT MEANING PROCESS THAT MAKES US REALLY UNIQUELY HUMAN AND THAT IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE EMOTIONS OVER TIME I THINK INCREDIBLE AIF I'M UNDERSTANDING CORRECTLY THERE SAY FEELING STATE IN OUR BODY WHEN WE EXPERIENCE IM OR OBSERVE SOMEBODY IN IN THEIR OWN FEELING STATE OR EXPERIENCE IM IT MAY BE THE SAME AS THEIRS MIGHT BE DIFFERENT AND FRANKLY S ANERAL SCIENTISTS I'M GOING TO SAY WILL NEVER KNOW EXACTLY IT WE WON'T NO AN OLS THE ISOPHICAL TEB WE WON  I TEN WOAN YUSEE BLOW IS AT THE SAME THINGS I VERIENCE I PROBABLY NOT BASTE ON SO FROM MY KNOWLEDGE OF COLOR VISION AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF CONES TO EXPLAIN WHY I'M SAYING THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF CONE PHOTOFIGMENTS IN YOUR EYE IN MY EYE ARE EXTREMELY DIFFERENT AH TO THE POINT WHERE WE'RE NOT WORKING WITH THE SAME PALAT  AND I THINK THAT MAKES WY MATRES  LI INTERESTING  BUT I BUT ASSUMING THAT NEITHER OF US IS COLOR BLIND RED IS SIMILAR ENOUGH TO BOTH OF US THAT WE BOTH LOOK AT AND SAY THAT'S REGT BUT ONE AND EIGHTY MAILS IS REDGRIN COLOR BLIND WOULD LOOK AT IT AND WOULD UM SEE WHAT YOU AND I CALL RED AND CALL IT ORANGE IN ANY EVENT WHEN WE LET'S A LISTEN TO OR WATCH AND LISTEN TO MARLUSER KING SE YOUR CLASSIC I HAVE A DREAM SCANCH IM OR WHEN I HEAR CERTAIN MUSIC THAT I FIRST HEARD WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN ASA PARTICULARLY INTERESTING FOR ME TIME IN MY LIFE IN PARKS I WAS FOURTEEN AND WE'LL GET BACK TO THAT AND WERE AGAIN MA TA A FORTIN T THING I BO AT A LESCENCE RIT I'LL JUST SAY I'LL GO ON RECORVY SAING THAT THE I THING THAT THE MUSIC THAT WE LISTEN TO IN OUR ADOLESCENCE IN TEEN YEARS IS ONE OF THE MAIN WAYS IN WHICH WE COME TO RECOGNIZE THE EXTREMES OF THESE FEELING STATE TAPLETS THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING I CAN ONE OF THE WAYS I PREPARE FOR PODCAST IS IM IS TO WALK IN AND FOR MY SOLO PODCAST IS TO WALK AND GO THROUGH SOME OF THE NARRATIVE MY NEIGHBORS THIN COME CRAZY IUM BUT THAT'S WHA K I THINK THEY'RE CRAZY TOO UM BE THER AS FRIGHT A THAT'S RIGHT AD EXACTLY AND UM BUT I I ALWAYS KNOW WHAT MUSIC TO LISTEN TO BEFORE I DO A SLO PODCAST DEPENDING ON THE STATE THAT I HAPPEN TO BE IN DRIVING INTO THE STUDIO VERS IS THE ONE I NEED TO BE IN IN ORDER TO THE DELIVER THAT PARTICULAR MATERIAL AND I KNOW BECAUSE I IT'S ALMOST LIKE KNOWING WHAT PALLID OF COLORS AND EMOTIONAL COLORS I HAVE IN ME AT THE MOMENT AND WHICH ONE ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED  DELIVER THAT MATERIAL AM BECAUSE IT IT'S DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON ON THE TOPIC A MATTER FOR THAT EPISODE WHAT I'M REFERRING TO HERE IS IS THIS  IDEA THAT UM YOU KNA WE WE COME TO UNDERSTAND EMOTIONS THROUGH OUR OWN EXPERIENCE AND HOW OBSERVING OTHER PEOPLE AND LISTENING TO CERTAIN MUSIC CAN INFLUENCE THAT AND I I REALIZE THAT SOME PEOPLE PROBABLY HAVE MORE OF A BUFFER BETWEEN THERE AM EXPERIENCE OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD SO CALLED EXTEROCEPTION SEEM THINGS OUTSIDE US AM AND THERE INTERNAL LANDSCAPE U SOME PEOPLE  I REALIZE HAVE VERY LITTLE NARRATIVE DISTANCING IN FACT LIVE WITH SOME ONE WHO HAS VERY LITTLE NARRATIVE DISTANCING WHEN SHE WATCHES A MOVY IF THE PERSON GETS PAUNCHED YES SHE DIS SHE SHE FENCHES UM IF IT'S A HAPPY MOVY SHE GETS HAPPY EIF SOMEBODY IN A MOVI IS SAD SHE REALLY FEELS IN FOR A WHILE I THOUGH GOODNESS EENO THIS IS LIKE REALLY SEEMS A LITTLE EXTREME BUT I I'VE TALKED TO PROFESSIONALS ABOUT THIS AND IT'S SOMETHING CALL LACK OF NARRATIVE DISTANCI I INSPORTATION IT IS ANOTHER WAY TO SAY YET BEING TRANSPORTED BY A STORY RIGHT AND AND I THINK THAT IT'S IT HAS ITS ADAPTED UTILITY I'M NOT BEING CRITICAL I THINK THAT'S AN INCREDIBLY INTERESTING ASPECT TO OURSELFS SOME OF US I I'VE A LOT MORE NARRATIVE DISTANCING ESPECIALLY WITH VIOLENCE AND I I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE I GROPE ROUND A LOT MORE VIOLENCE THAN SHE DID AND SO I SEE SOMEBODY YOU KNOW GET BEHEADED IND A FELM AND I AND I UNLESS IT'S SOMETHING WHERE I'VE REALLY BEEN BUILT IN TO THE STORY OF THAT PERSON AND IT WAS A REAL WORLD THING THAT I KNEW ACTUALLY HAPPENED THAN I I JUST COME TO GO OKE WHAT'S A MOVY AND HITS A MOVY IT'S NOT REAL AND IF IT'S A MOVY ABOUT SOMETHING THAT 'S REAL THAT MIGHT BE A LO BIT MORE OF AN EMOTIONAL IMPACT AND OF COURSE IF IT'S A DOCUMENTARY AND IT'S REAL FOOTAGE IT'S PRETTY ROUGH YE BUT I DON'T UM I'M NOT HORRIFIED IN THE IN THE WAY THAT SHE'S HORRIFIED AND I'M HORRIFIED BUT NOT TO THE SAME EXTENT UM SO OBVIOUSLY THAT SOME OF US HAVE MORE OF A BUFFER THAN OTHERS UM AND YOU CAN SEE THIS IN A MOVY OR IN A CLASSROOMFUL OF KIDS WATCHING A A SPEECH LIKE THE IYE OF A DREAM SPEECH OR HEARING THE ROSEAPARTS STORY OR FOR INSTANCE OR UMLISTENING WE TO AND WATCHING A DAVID GOGIN SOCIAL MEDIOPOST I'M A DAVID EARLIER BECAUSE YOUR SON HAD A QUESTION FOR ME ABOUT DAVID GOGAN THAN I HAPPENED TO U HAVE THE GOOD FORTUNE OF OF HAVING MET AND KNOW A LITTLE BIT I DON'T KNOW M VERY WELL BUT I KNOW AM IN FROM SOME INPERSON A INTERACTIONS AND HE IS EVERY BIT AS INTENSE AND EVERY BIT AS SERIOUS ABOUT HIS UM ON GOING PROGRESSION AS HE APPEARS TO BE THAT THERE'S THERE'S NO FALSEHOOD THERE IT IS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT DATE A FACT DANULINT HE DOES WHAT HE CLAIMS TO DO IAM MORE YEUM THAT WE DON'T HEAR ABOUT SUPERIMPRESS OF HUMAN BEING SO WHEN WE SEE SOMETHING LIKE A DAVID GOGIN'S POST OR WE WATCH AND LISTEN TO THAT I HAVE A DREAM SPEECH AND WE START TO FEEL SOMETHING YE LIKE WEL WE'RE FEELING INSPIRED TO USE THE THE BASIC LANGUAGE ARE WE MAPPING TO SOME SUBCONSCIOUS A WARENESS OF THAT IN OURSELVES UM MEANING ARE WE MAPPING TO SOMETIME WHEN WE FELT INSPIRED IN ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE OR ARE WE REALLY YOU KNOWIS IS THIS MERELY KIND OF A RETURN TO A FEELING STATE THAT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE I DON'T NO THE EXPERIMENTS HAVE EVER BEEN DONE ON THIS BUT IS THERE ANYWAY TO TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN TR ULY HAVE NOVEL EMOTIONS PAST AGE FIFTEEN UM OR WE REALLY DIS REGEARNING OR THAT NOR WE'S REALLY JUST DOING A SORT OF TEMPLET MATCHING OF WHILE I'M FEELING THIS AGAIN AND AN THIS MAKES ME FEEL CAPABLE LIKE A NEW OUT N RUN TODAY EVEN THOUGH I WAS GOING BASILY NOT RUN TO DAY WUM OR YOU KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE TO HAVE A A FANTACY VIEW ABOUT HOW THE WORLD COULD BE IN TERMS OF AM EQUALITY THAT A AN OPPORTUNITY AND YOUN WHAT I THAT'S SUBCONSCIOUSLY AS MY BRAIN SAYING I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS SIXTON AND I DIDN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOME PEOPLE HAVING OPPORTUNITY IND OTHER PEOPLE NOT HAVING OUTI A IS THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING OR DO YOU THINK THAT WE ARE MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN THAT AND WE ARE ACTUALLY REALLY UM A RESPONDING TO WHAT WE THINK WERE RESPONDING TO OH EWAH THERE'S LATTIN THERE AM A A COUPLE A COUPLE OF THINGS TO STARTS THE THE FIRST THING I WAS THINKING BEFORE WHEN YOU'RE TONG ABOUT THE VISUAL SAS TOM WHICH I THINK IT'S RELEVANT NOW AM IS IS THAT AS HUMANS THE MORE DEVELOPED WE GOT THE MORE EXPERIENCE WE HAVE THE MORE AM WE'VE ADAPTED TO THE CONTEXTS IN WHICH WE LIVE YOU KNOW THE REAL PHYSICAL CONTEXT IN THIS CASE THE VISUAL CONTEXT INCLUDED M BU BUT ALSO THE CULTURAL VALUES OF THAT CONTEXT THE THINGS WE'VE NOTICED OTHER PEOPLE NOTES RIGHT HOW DO YOU LEARN WHEN YOU'RE LIVING IN THE JUNGLE THAT ON YOU SEE EYEBALLS YOU SHOULD YET I HOPE G STAND NEXT YOUR MAMME RIGHT A SO YOU LEARN WHAT TO NOTICE YOU LEARN WHAT WHAT YOU NEED TO ATTEND TO IN THE WORLD AND YOURE SO WHEN WE ARE PERCEIVING THINGS EITHER VERY BASIC THINGS LIKE A VISUAL SCENE OR HUGELY COMPLEX ELABORATE THINGS LIKE A MARTIN LUTHER KINGS SPEECH WE ARE AS MUCH IMPOSING ON TO THE WORLD OUR OWN EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT IS THERE AS WE ARE PERCEIVING WHAT'S ACTUALLY THERE RIGHT SO AS WE IMPOSE ON TO THE WORLD WE BRING WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL OUR CULTURAL WAYS OF SCENG AND KNOWING ORE VALUES AND BELIEFS AND WE PUSH THEM ON TO THE EXPERIENCE OF WHAT WE NOTICE SO EVEN IN VERY BASIC WAYS THINGS LIKE CULTURAL VALUES A CHANGE THE WAY IN WHICH PEOPLE OBSERVE AND REMEMBER SCENES RIGHTS SO YOU KNOW THEIRE'S CLASSIC WORK BY CHINOBUCITIAMA AND OTHER PEOPLE SHOWING THAT IN JAPAN VERSES IN A IN THE UES A WHEN YOU SHOW  PEOPLE A SCENE OF A YOU KNW LICKE AN UNDERWATER SCENE WITH LIKE ALL THE BEAUTIFUL THINGSTHATREUNDER WATER ROCKS AND PLANTS AND THINGS IN LITLE FISH SLUMMING BY AND THEN ONE BIG FISH SLOMMING BY RIGHT AND YOU ASK A JAPANESE PERSON A WHAT'S AS A PICTURE OF THEY TEND TO TALK ABOUT IT'S A SCENE OF ROCKS AND PLANS AND LITTLE FISH AND TAN A BIG FISH SWIMS BY A IF YOU ASK IN AMERICAN A A WESTERN EDUCATED PERSON WHAT IS THIS PICTURE OF THEY SAY OH IT'S A FISH SWIMMING THROUGH A SCENE RIGHT WE WE TEND TO NOTICE FIRST AND YOU C HE'S SHOWN THAT THIS IS YOU KNOW IS VERY VERY AUTOMATIC IT'S VERY LOW LEVEL IT IT'S PERCEPTULE NOT JUST CONCEPTIULE AND IT ACTUALLY CHANGES WHAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY NOTICE IN THE SCENE AND WHAT THEY REMEMBER LATER AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF RIGHT WE LEARN HOW TO SORT OF FILTER IMPET WE'RE NOT LITTLE YOU KNOW A ROBATS OR LITTLE A A VIDIOCAMERAS WALKING AROUND OBSERVING THE WORLD AND SO WHEN WE SEE SOMETHING AS COMPLEX AS A SOCIAL STORY WE IMPOSE ON TO THAT ALL KINDS OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCES SO YOU SAID ARE WE EVER ABLE TO EXPERIENCE NEW EMOTIONS AFTER EACH FIFTEEN I THINK NO BUT WE ARE VERY WELL ABLE TO EXPERIENCE NEW FEELINGS RIGHT WHICH ARE THE COMPLEX ELABORATIONS OF THESE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATES AND THE STORIES WE TELL OURSELVES ABOUT THE MEANING BEHIND THEM THAT IS DEVELOPING ALL THE TIME AND IT'S DEVELOPING THROUGH ALL KINDS OF QUOTIN QUOCOGNITIVE MEDIA WE DO IT THROUGH OUR SCIENCE RIGHT BY BEING INSPIRED AND INTERESTED IN SOMETHING BY BEING IN AWE OF SOMETHING WE DO IT THROUGH ART THROUGH TRYING TO EXPRESS AN EMOTION OR A FEELING OR A VALUE STATE THROUGH THE WAY IN WHICH WE POTRAY SOMETHING TO OTHER PEOPLE RIGHT AS HUMANS WE ARE DRIVEN I MEAN EVEN AS CAVE PEOPLE WE WERE DRIVEN TO SAY I WAS HERE HERE'S MY HAND PRANT I'M IN A SPIT IT ON TO A ROCK SO FOREVERMORE ANYBODY ELSE COMES AN NEARES CAN TO SEE THAT IT WAS ME WHO WAS HERE AND I HAVE A ME RIGHT AND SO WHAT WERE REALLY DOING IS MOVING THROUGH THE WORLD NOT IN THIS KIND OF RECEPTIVE PASSIVE WAY BUT WE ARE ACTIVELY IMPOSING OURSELVES ON TO THE WORLD WERE ACTIVELY BRINGING ARE INTERPRETIVE POWER AND ADAPTING WHAT WE DO NEXT RELATIVE TO THE WAY IN WHICH WE ACCOMMODATE RID PIAGE TALKED ABOUT THIS A HUNDRED YEARS AGO ACCOMMODATE OR ASSIMILATE THOSE THINGS INTO US THAT WE THAT THAT MAY DISAGREE WITH OUR SCHEMA THAT MAY AH THAT MAY A LINE AND ACCORD AND REENFORCE THEM SO THIS MATTERS A LOT FOR THE WAYS THAT HUMANS EXPERIENCE THE WORLD MORE BROADLY BECAUSE THINK ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE AM A TERRIBLE TOPIC LIKE GENICIDE OR THE HOLOCOSTRATE HOW DOES SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPEN RIGHT HOW IS IT THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE EMPATHY WHO WHO LOVE THEIR FAMILY WHO LOVE THEIR NEIGHBORS CAN SUDDENLY TURN ON EACH OTHER RIGHT WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THEY'VE SHIFTED THE WAY IN WHICH THEY NARATIZE THE CONTEXT OF THOSE EVENTS THE WAY IN WHICH THEY IMPOSE INTERPRETATION ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S PAIN HAS BEENFUNDAMENTALLY SHIFTED FROM THAT'S ANOTHER HUMAN SUFFERING TO THAT'S NOT A HUMAN THAT'S A A RAT A PIG A BUG AND WHATEVER IT IS RIGHT AND THAT DEHUMANIZATION PROCESS ALLOWS US TO SHIFT OUR STORIES SET SO THAT WE BRING ANOTHER SET OF VALUES AND BELIEFS INTO THE SPACE AM  I JUS AS IM I'M GLAD THAT YOU'VE BROUGHT UP THAT ARK EXAMPLE BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING FROM MY PSYCHOLOGY COURSES AND UNIVERSITY WERE THAT I'M AS MUCH AS WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO THINK THAT WE ARE INCAPABLE OF BEING THE COMMITTERS OF GENI CAPABLE  THAT THEIR TUDIES BEN THAT WERE DONE IN THE FIFTIES BUT THEN HAVE BEEN REPEATED OVER MANY DECADES SHOWING THAT IM INCERTAIN CONTACTS AM ESSENTIALLY EVERYBODY IN ANYBODY WOULD RESPOND TO A AN AUTHORITARIAN FIGURE AND TORTURE SOMEBODY ELSE AND AN I'M SURE AS PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO US THIS THEIR THINKING NO I WOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT DO THAT BUT ALL THE DATA POINT TO THE FACT THAT IF THE CONDITIONS WERE SET IN A PARTICULAR WAY IM YOU AND I AND EVERYBODY ELSE MOST CERTAINLY WOULD A VERY ERIE IDEA THAT I GOES BACK TO I THINK YOUNGS IDEA THAT WE HAVE ALL THINGS INSIDE OF US AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE ALL THE NAURAL CIRCUITRY COMPONENTS INSIDE OF US FOR I'M RAGE AND  CONTEMPT IN UM AND HORRIBLEMIS TREATMENT OF OTHERS AS WELL AS ALL THE GOOD STUFF IAM A BUT I I'M JUST GLAD THAT YOU BROUGHT UP THIS EXAMPLE BECAUSE IM I THINK THAT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IT'S ITS INCONCEIVABLE BUT I'VE NEVER HEARD IT FRAMED THE WAY THAT YOUR DESCRIBING IT WHICH IS THAT IF THE STORY BECOMES NOT ABOUT THE OTHER PERSON SUFFERING BUT PRIMARILY ABOUT ONE'S OWN STORY OF SUFFERING AND THAT CAN SUPPRESS OR LITERALLY INHIBIT THE NARRL CIRCUITS THAT INVOKE EMPATHY A THEN IT MAKES PERFECTLY GOOD NUR BIOLOGICAL SENSE AS TO WHY THAT WOULD AT LEAST BE POSSIBLE AND OF COURSE I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD THING IT'S JUST IM LIKE MANY ASPECTS OF OUR BIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY JUST HAPPENS TO BE THE WAY THINGS ARE IT IS AN I THINK IT REALLY I THINK I MEAN I'M THE EVER THE OPTIMIST I'M ALSO EVER THE EDUCATOR RI I I KNOW I'M A TEACHER I'M VERY ALSO VERY INTERESTED IN THE WAYS THAT WE DESIGN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE I THINK THE ONLY HOPE WE HAVE TO PROTECT OURSELVES AGAINST THESE POSSIBILITIES IS TO SYSTEM MATICALLY DEVELOP DISPOSITIONS IN OURSELVES PROCLIVITIES WITHIN OURSELVES TO QUESTION OUR OWN MOTIVES AND TO DECONSTRUCT OUR OWN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT SITUATIONS AND TO ENGAGE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S PERSPECTIVES SYSTEMATICALLY AND WHEN WE DEVELOP THOSE DISPOSITIONS THE HOPE IS THAT WE ARE DEVELOPING WITHIN OURSELVES A KIND OF A A A VETO SYSTEM RIGHT A SYSTEM FOR CHECKING OUR OWN MOTIVATIONS AGAINST OTHER PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCES OF THOSE MOTIVATIONS AND YOU KNOW SO MUCH OF WHAT'S LEADING I THINK THOUGH NOW A'RE GOING IN ANOTHER DIRECTION IND A KIND O OF POLITICAL DIRECTION BUT SO MUCH WHAT'S LEADING US IN TO THESE VERY DEVISIVE POLITICAL TYPES FOR EXAMPLE NOT JUST AND YOU KNOW THE RISE OF AUTHORITARIANISM NOT JUST IN THE UES OR THE THREAD OF IT NOT JUST IN THE USS BUT AROUND MANY PLACES IN THE WORLD ALL OF WHICH BY THE WAY ARE WESTERN EDUCATED A A IS THAT WE ARE TAUGHT THAT TO KNOW SOMETHING MEANS YOU OWN SOMETHING IN YOURSELVE AND THEN YOU TAKE THAT WITH YOU AND YOU IMPOSE IT ON THE WORLD FOREVERMORE I KNOW HOW TO DO OL TO RETO AND I CAN DO IT WHENEVER YOU ASKME KIND OF THING AND THAT'S WHAT I GOUD STUDENT IS WHERE WHEN PEOPLE IN LEARN TO ENGAGE WITH THEIR OWN KNOWLEDGE STATES IN IN MORE CURIOUS OPEN MINDED FLEXIBLE WAYS THEN WE DISPOSITIONALLY TEACH OURSELVES TO TO CHECK ARE ASUMPTIONS TO WE THINK WHAT WE THINK WE KNOW AND IN THIS IS KEE DEVELOP MENTALLY TO NOTICE WHEN WE NEED TO DO THAT AND WHEN WE SHOULD JUST PLOUGH HADN ITS TOTALLY FINE AND AND SO WHAT WE'RE DOING I THINK RIGHT NOW TO OURSELVES BOTH IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND IN THINGS LIKE SOCIAL MEDIA IS WERE RE ENFORCING OUR OWN BIACES BY DIVING DOWN RABIT HOLES WHERE YOU WE HEAR THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT WE ENFORCES YOUR OWN BELIEF SYSTEMS AND THEN YOU COME TO BELIEVE THOSE THINGS AND THOSE PUT YOU ON AR TRAIN TOWARD A PARTICULAR KIND OF ACTION OR BELIEF SYSTEM THAT NEVER BECOMES DECONSTRUCTED AND IS VERY COMFORTABLE IT'S EASY TO DO BUT THE RESPONSIBILITY I THINK WE HAVE AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS GROUPS AS HUMANS GIVEIN THE AMAZING INTELLIGENCE WE HAVE IS TO RISE ABOVE THAT AND ACTUALLY LOOK BACK ON OUR OWN SELVES REFLECTIVELY AND DECONSTRUCT OUR PREFERENCES DECONSTRUCT OUR VALUES AND OUR BELIEFS AND SYSTEMATICALLY QUERRY THEM SPECIFICALLY AROUND HOW THEY IMPACT OR INFLUENCE OR OR OR CHANGE THE SITUATIONS OF THOSE AROUND US OR DON'T RIGHT THE SITUATIONS AND SUSTAINABILITY OF THE WORLD THAT SUPPORTS US OR DON'T AND SO IT IT ALL COMES BACK TO THE EMOTIONS THAT DRIVE OUR THINKING SO WE HAVE THESE VERY BASIC PRIMITIVE PHYSIOLOGICAL STATES WHICH VARY ACROSS INDIVIDUALS THE DEGREE TO WHICH THEY ARE YOU KNOW INCREDIBLY POWERFUL EASILY EVOKED FIRST IS NOT YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF RANGE IN THAT  ALL OF THAT VARIATION MAKES THINGS INTERESTING RIGHT A BUT IT'S OUR ABILITY TO LEARN TO EXPERIENCE THOSE AND TO NO IT DEVELOP WISDOM AROUND WHEN WE NEED TO QUARRY OUR OWN EMOTIONS AND DECONSTRUCT THE NARRATIVES THAT ARE THAT WE'RE USING TO VALIDATE OR SUBSTANTIATE THOSE KINDS OF EMOTIONS IN ORDER TO ASSESS WHETHER WE ACTUALLY ARE RIGHT WHETHER WE SHOULD CONTINUE OR WHETHER WE SHOULD STEP BACK AND AND AND AND AND REFRAN RIGHT AND SO THAT KIND OF MENTAL FLEXIBILITY REALLY COMES OUT OF AN EMOTIONAL DISPOSITION IT IT IS OUR ABILITY SO IT TAKES IT BACK TO WHAT YOU'RE ASKING AT THE VERY BEGINNING IT IS OUR ABILITY TO NOT JUST DRIVE FROM WHAT FEELS LIKE THE BOTTOM UP WHICH OF COURSE IS ALWAYS STARTING ON THE TOP DOWN BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT SOME INTERPRETATION OF THE WORLD THAT MAKES YOU FEEL FEAR THAT MAKES YOUR BODTO DO THIS THAT MAKES YOU RET A BUT ALSO TO BE ABLE TO RISE ABOVE TO TRANSCEND AND THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE BROADER SYSTEMIC HISTORICAL I A ETHICAL CIVIC IMPLICATIONS OF THIS NARRATIVE ON TELLING MYSELF WHICH FEELS THE FAULT LIKE THE TRUTH AND HOW MIGHT I DECONSTRUCT THOSE SYSTEMATICALLY AND HOW MIGHT I INVITE OTHERS TO GIVE ME THEIR VERSION OF THOSE EVENTS AND ENGAGE WITH THOSE SYSTEMATICALLY IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO REALLY APPRECIATE THE IMPLICATIONS OF MY BELIEFS AND SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THE EMOTIONS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT TO DAY ARE ACTUALLY THE FUNDAMENTAL DRIVERS OF ALL OF OUR THINKING DECISION MAKING RELATIONSHIP BUILDING RIHT OUR COMMUNITY LIVES AND OUR PERSONAL WELL BEING ALL IN ONE MIX BUT THAT DOESN'T KIND OF EXCUSE US FOR ACTING ON THEIR BEQUEST IT ACTUALLY IMBUSE US WITH A RESPONSIBILITY TO THEN DEVELOP DISPOSITIONS TO SYSTEMATICALLY QUERY THOSE AND REFRAME THEM WHEN THEY ARE NOT SERVING US OER THE WORLD WELL EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID A AS SO MUCH SO THAT YOU A I'M A BEBELIEVER IN FOLLOWING LOTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS YET I'VE TAKEN SOME HEAT HERE AND THERE BECAUSE PEOPLE AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME THAT IF YOU FOLLOW AN ACCOUNT THAT YOU SUBSCRIBE TO THAT IDEOLOGY BUT I FOLLOW MANY ACCOUNTS TO MY DISAGREE WITH WHAT THEY SAY YSPECIFICALLY SO THAT I CAN LEARN DIFFERENT PERSPECTIV UM AS FAR AS I KNOW WERE THE SAME SPECIES AMEAN THESE OTHER PEOPLE YES O OURS WE ARE OMETIMES I WONDER BUT UM THEY PRIY WONE OF THEY WANE I MARY I WONDER TO UM AND THERE'S ENORMOUS RANGE IN IN IN THOSE O THOSE ACCOUNTS THAT I FOLLOW AM IN I FOLLOWED DIFFERENT COUNTS FOR FRON REASON SOME FOR ENTERTAINMENT SOME FOR INFORMATION SOME FOR CHALLENGING MYSELF SOME FOR A MY DESIRE TO BE BAFFLED EVERY NOW AND AGAIN BUT TO ALWAYS RETURN TO THIS IDEA THAT WE'RE ALL WE ARE ALL BASICALLY WORKING WITH THE SAME BUILDING BLOCKS OF NURONS AND NERAL CHEMISTRY SOME PEOPLE'S DOPAMEIN WHICH WHETHER NOT YOU'RE INTO BIT COIN OR A NETURETITIONAL CURRENCY A THE ONE TRUE CURRENCY THATS UNIVERSAL IS DOPAME  EVERYONE'S WORK A ID OPENING AND EXCHANGING THEIR OWN DOPENING WITH WORLD EXPERIENCES BUT THERE'S ONE O THE REASON WHY THING IT'S IMPORTANT TO A NOT BE SYLODE IN ONE'S THINKING OR EXPOSURE TO DIFFEREN THINGS ON SOCIAL MEDIA A SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSIAL STATEMENT ACTUALLY BECAUSE I THINK ALOD YE WILL ASSUME THAT IF YOU FOLLOW SOMEBODY FROM A PARTICULAR POLITICAL PARTY THAT THAT MEANS THAT YOU VOTE THAT POLITICAL PARTY ET CETERA AM U THAT TO ME ALWAYS SEEM CRASIA I 'M FORTUNATE HAVE IS A GOOD FRIEND WHO IS ON THIS POD TAST RICK RUBENES OF EXTREMELY ACCOMPLISH MUSIC PRODUCER IN INSTED PRODUCE MUSY FROM ESSENCIALLY EVERY JONOR OF MUSIC PONGERACOS  OUR SERVE I GOT MY START AND STILL LOVE PONKROUF MUSIC SO MUCH BUT CLASSICAL AND HIPPOP AN EVERYTHNG IN BETWEEN A RICA SOMEBODY WHO FORGES SO BROADLY I NEVEREALLY LEARNED TO TRY IN FORAGE BROADLY IN TERMS OF IDEAS AND IDEOLOGYS AND I THINK LODPE WERE JUST SCARED TO BE EXPOSED TO SOMETHING THAT THEY HATE SO MUCH BECAUSETHEY DON'T LIKE THAT FEELING IN THEIR BODY OF OF DISAGREEMENT AM BUT I AT ISN'T ITS YE VERY  YOU KNW THAT KIND OF COGNITIVE DISANETS PHICODUS VERY DIFFICULT IT TAKES WORK TO RES ALL THAT YE I I GUESS IT IS THER I LIKE TO THINK THERE'S A WAY TO STEP BACK FROM THAT AND OBSERVE IT NOT FROM A DISCONNECTED STANCE BUT FROM A PLACE OF CURIOSITY ABOUT WHAT'S DRIVING THE THOSE MECHANISMS AND PEOPLE AND AND MAY BE WHERE WE NEED TO ADJUST OUR THINKING MAY BE NOT TO ADOPT THEIR MODE OF THINKING ONE HUNDRED PER CENT I YOU KNOW TEN PER CENT OR TWO PER CENT I THINK ONE OF THE THE REASONS THINGS ARE SO DEVISIVE RIGHT NOW IS BECAUSE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND THI SYLOING OR OF OF CONORCHARD VERY ADIVERGENT TRAJECTORIES OF PEOPLE ONLY FOLLOWING AND LISTENING TO AN OBEYING CERTAIN KINDS OF INFORMATION AND OTHER PEOPLE THE OTHER AND I THINK THE PANDAMIC IS THE PLACE WERE ALL THAT RE LY CLASHED VERY HEAVILY AMAN CONTINUES TO CLASH ANOTHER AREIS TO UM CERTAINLY NOT SOMETHING I'S GOING TO BE SOLVED A INSIDE OF THIS CONVERSATION AND YET I DO HAVE UM A QUESTION THAT THAT GROWS FROM THISASPECT OF OUR DISCUSSION WHICH IS YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK CAN BE DONE AT A CONCRETE LEVEL IN TERMS OF EDUCATION OF YOUNGER PEOPLE AS WELL AS EDUCATION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND AND BEYOND TO A TRYING ADOPT THESE WERE UM INCOMPASSING MODES OF OF LEARNING AND EXPERIENCING THE WORLD I MEAN IT'S ONE THING TO SAY YOU KNOW EXPOSE YOURSELF TO LOTS OF DIFFERENT IDEAS UM IT'S ANOTHER TO TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO HOW TO DO THAT ON A WAY THAT THAT IS UM ADAPTIVE AND  ANY IDEAS YOU HAVE UM I THINK I DO IAN AND THE AUDIENCE WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE AN AND FEEL FREE TO TO UM MAKE THIS AN EDITORIAL U WHAT ERE MAT I ACT TO DATE I AMEAN OBVIOUSLY THIS IS YOUR WEAL HOUSES  THISS IS YOUR EXPERT Y SO I'M CURIOUS WHAT WHACH WE DO SHOULD SHOULD I SEND MY FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAVE VERY DIVERGENT POLITICAL BELIEFS FROM ME UM INFORMATION UM TO THE TO THE CONTRARY THEY'R THINKING OR SHWHAT WOULD I DO AND WHET OAT YOU FOR ME WHA SHALL WE ALL BE DOING WITH OUR TEN YEAR OLDS AND OR YI IN OURSELVES WELL I WON'T I WON'T COMMET ON SHOULD YOU SEND YOUR FAMILY MAMBERS YEUR IF I THERE'S NOTHER PEOPLE HTA DO THAT A TE TE TE  TAT WORK AND THEY KNOW HOW TO ALWAYS FRUSTR SHU THOT OVERTAN US IS SO IT'S O CACANKANY REO NOW WH CAN WE ALL LO EACH OTHER AND BUT ONE THING I REALLY DO THINK A LOT ABOUT AND THIS IS UM THE WAY IN WHICH WE EDUCATE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE MIGHTE WE DO WITHOUT TEN YEAR ELS A AND LIKE THE THI FIRST THING I'LL SAY ABOUT YOUR TIME I LL I DON'T IF YOU AC SUALLI AVE ATHING ELT BUT IS A IS IS QUERY THEM ABOUT THEIR BELIEFS WHEN THEY FOLLOW SOMETHING WHEN THEY THINK SOMETHING'S IMPRESSIVE OR BAD ORE YOU KNOW ASK THEM WHY TEACH THEM TO UNPACKED THEIR OWN BELIEFS THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU THAT YO DON'T STILL HOLD THEM NECESSARILY IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU ADOPT THE OPPOSITE BELIEF RAIGHT IF I TALK TO SOMEONE WHO HAS A VERY DIFFERENT VALUE SYSTEM THAN I DO AND I DISAGREE WITH THEM THAT'S LEGITIMATE BUT TO IT ALSEO BUT BUT IN DECIDING THAT I DISAGREE I HAVE SORT OF WE VISITED MY OWN BELIEF AND QUERIED IT I'VE I'VE EXTERNALIZED IT A LITTLE BIT MADE THAT THINKING VISIBLE AS WYWAY WE TALK ABOUT IT IN EDUCATION THAT'S DAVID PERKINS THAT HARVAN TALKS BETTER THAT WAY YOU NO MAKING YOU'RE THINKING VISIBLE AND THEN EXAMINING THAT THINKING AND AND SO I THINK ONE REALLY IMPORTANT STAT THAT AS SOCIETY WILL HAVE TO TAKE OR WE WON'T MAKE IT AND I KNOW THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE EM DRAMATIC BUT I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S TRUE SADLY AH AND I'M STAREN TO THINK IT'S MORE IN MORTRUE IS THAT WE NEED TO REALLY GET BRAVE ABOUT HOW WE THINK ABOUT THE PROCESS OF EDUCATING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS TO EXPOSE YOUNG PEOPLE TO DEVELOP MENTALLY APPROPRIATE AGE APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITIES TO GROW THEMSELVES AS THINKERS AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS CIVIC AGENTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS  I THINK THAT OURE WESTERN DESIGNED EDUCATION SYSTEM HAS IN IT SOME VERY BASIC BELIEFS ABOUT WHAT COUNTS AS KNOWING AND WHAT IS WORTH THINKING ABOUT AND KNOWING ABOUT AND HOW DO I KNOW THAT HOW DO I TEST YOU ON THAT THAT I THINK IS DEEPLY THEY ARE DEEPLY PROBLEMATIC AND READ US I MEAN I KNOW THIS IS A STRONG STEAMENT BUT THEY LEAD US TO A PLACE WHERE WE ARE WE ARE ACTIVELY PUNISHED NOT JUST NOT ENCOURAGED BUT I WOULD SAY ACTIVELY DISCOURAGED FROM REALLY PLAYING WITH IDEAS ENGAGING SYSTEMATICALLY WITH OUR OWN BELIEFS DECONSTRUCTING THOSE BELIEFS AND ENGAGING WITH COMPLEX PERSPECTIVES ON TOPICS AND IDEAS THAT IS JUST NOT WHAT SCHOOL IS ABOUT AND IT NEEDS TO BE WE NEED TO SHIPT SO RIGHT NOW THE WAY IN WHICH WE THINK ABOUT SCHOOL IS ABOUT IS BASICALLY JUDGED BY QUOTE ON QUOTE LEARNING OUTCOMES RIGHT WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED AND HOW DO WE KNOW THAT WE MAKE YOU DEMONSTRATED BY YOURSELF UNDERTIME PRESSURE IN A PARTICULAR SETIC RIGHT OR YOU'RE GONGTO COME BACK AND I'M GOIN TO GIVE YOU A QUESTION AND YOU'RE GOIG O GO BE THE ANSWER I HADN'T MIND AND IF YOU DO THAT IN TIME THEN I'LL SAY YOU LEARN IT AND NOW WE'RE DONE CHECK RIGHT AS COMPARED TO A SYSTEM AND THERE ARE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS LIKE THIS THIS IS NOT A THERE ARE PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE THE PERFORMANCE A ASSESSMENT CONSORTION IN NEW YORK CITY IS IS A CONSORTION OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS SOME OF WHICH DO THIS EXTRAORDINARILY WELL THEY HAVE A A DISPENSATION FROM THE NEW YORK STATE GOVERNMENT A NOT TO GIVE THE REGENCE EXAMINE AS THEIR GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS A AND THERE A AND AND THEIR THERE MARK BENCHMARKS OF LEARNING BUT INSTEAD TO HAVE ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF ASCESSING KIDS WORK KIDS WORK FOR MONTHS TO YEARS DEPENDING ON THE PROJECT ON THESE INDEPTS INTELLECTUAL MULTI DISPLINARY PROJECTS WHERE THEY EXPLORE A TOPICT AND THEY ENGAGE WITH THEIR OWN PROCESS OF LEARNING ABOUT THAT TOPIC AND THEY BRING IN TEACHERS AND COMMUNITY EXPERTS AND OTHER PEOPLE IN THEY PRESENT THEIR WORK AND THEN THEY QUERRY THE WORK AND THEY TALK ABOUT THEIR OWN LEARNING PROCESS IN WHAT COULD HAPPEN NEXT AND WHAT DECISIONS THEY MADE AND ALWAYS GANGENTEXACTLY YOU HAVE TO INVENT NOT JUST THE WORK BUT THE QUESTION YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THE WORLD AND NOTICE WHAT IT IS WE'RE NOT UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WOULD BENEFIT FROM UNDERSTANDING AND FIND AWAY TO ISOLATE AND SYSTEMATICALLY QUERY THAT WHY DON'T WE BUILD EDUCATION SYSTEMS FROM PRE SCHOOL ALL THE WAY UP THAT AND THAT ENGAGE PEOPLE SYSTEMATICALLY IN THAT KIND OF INTELLECTUAL CURIOSITY WE DON'T DO THAT SO WE WE KNOW THAT LITTLE KID'S EDUCATION PRE SCHOOL EDUCATION IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE WATER TABLE ON THE SAND TABLE ON THE COOL STUFF AND THE CHOICES AND THE WAYS TO ENGAGE WITH EACH OTHER AND YOU DON'T EVEN ALL THE STUFF BEING REALLY AGE APPROPRIATE FOR THREE YEAR OLD TO TOUCH AND SMUSHON IN I'LL TRY TO TASTE IN WHATEVER ELSE THEY'RE GOIN TO BE AMESS ON THE FOOTNAR JSNUCK ON A COMMDE'R GOING TO REFUSE TO COME TO SCHOOL RIGHT AN THEYRE CAN BE LAYING IN THE IN THE DOORWAY THROWIN KIT TEMPERATENDERS BUT AS SO WE KNOW HOW TO DO LITTLE KID EDUCATION WHILE DOEN'T MEAN WHE ALWAYS DO IT BUT WE KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO BE INTRIGUED THEY NEED TO BE INVITED TO THINK AND THEY BRING THEIR NATURAL CURIOSITY AND THEN YOU' EXPAND THE RANGE OF WAYS THEY CAN LEVERAGE THAT CURIOSITY TO DISCOVER NEW THINGS THEY HADN'T KNOWN TO THINK ABOUT BEFORE RIGHT THEN WE GET TO THE STANDARD CONO COIT EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND WE SOMEHOW THINK THAT THAT NATURAL HUMAN PROCLIVITY TO ENGAGE CURIOUSLY AND MEANINGFULLY WITH DEEP THINKING ABOUT IDEAS AN THE WORLD IS IS LIKE INEFFICIENT AND INAPPROPRIATE AND FRIGHTENING AND WE TEACH KIDS NO NO NO NO NO TURN THAT OFF IT'S IT'S IT'S DANGEROUS IF YOU DO IT IT'S CONSIDERED INSUBORDINATE RIGHT AND WHAT WE WANT YOU INSTEAD TO DO IS JUST LET ME GIVE YOU WHAT I'VE ALREADY FIGURED OUT FOR YOU I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU AND YOU ARE GOING TO GIVE IT BACK TO ME SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IN THE WAY THINGS ACTUALLY HAPPEN IN SCHOOL WHAT IS CREATED IS THE KIND OF DESIRE FOR THE KID TO BE A COMPUTER NOT A HUMAN AND THEY DO HAVE A DOPEMEAN SYSTEM AN YASTO WHAT BECOMES THE THE BUZZ THE EMOTIONAL BUZZ IS PERFORMANCE YES IF IT BECOMES TE BUZZ AT ALL SO FOR THE KIDS THAT DON'T GET THAT BUZZ FROM PERFORMANCE  THEY DON'T I THAT DON'T INTRINSICALLY LOVE THE MATH OR THE ENGLISH OR THE BOOKS THAT THEY'RE BEING PRESENTED WITH OR OR WHATEVER THE SUBJECT HAPPENS TO BE IM OR MAYBE THE ONLY LIKE ONE OR TWO THINGS THEN THEY EMOTIONALLY DISSOCIATE FROUM THE REST OF THE MATERIAL I'M I MASH DESCRIBING A BIT OF MYSELF AND HIGH SCHOY I WAS NOT IT I BARELY FINISHED TIGH SCHOOL UM I DROPPED OUT O SIX GRAVE FOR A FEW MONTHS YET THEN WORK ME YO YON OVENTIONALY GOT BACK TO IT AND AND AS IM MAGINE YOU DID TO IM S WE ENDED UP AS ACADEMICS BUT UM I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS SO KEY U AND I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OH YES YOUNG KIDS THAK WERE GIVEN ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO DRIVE OUR CENSORY WORLD  IN THE APPROPRIATE WAYS TOUCH AND SOUND AND UM AT A MIND VIGA AN FYING A BILD MEANING IN OUR MIND AND THAT WE GET TO UM AS STUDENTS YOUNG VERY YOUNG LEARNERS IMPOSE SOME OF OUR OWN I INTRINSIC MOTIVATION TO DO CERTAIN THINGS AND NOT OTHERS AND THAT THAT ISN'T SUPPORTED AS WE'RE ADULT WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS SO WIDL WHAT AGE DO YOU THINK THIS UM CLIFFS OFF SO YOU OCASO IN PRE SCHOOL KIDS ARE ALLOWED TO DO THIS AN KINDRGARDEN THEY'RE LLOWED YO FIRST GRATE THEY'REALLOWED TO DO IT INTR IN MOST SCHOOLS BUT AT WHAT POINT TO KIT IS THE EXPECTATION IMPOSED ON KIDS TO BECOME LITTLE WROTE UM UM LEARNING COMPUTER MACHINES AND TO GET THEIR DOB AMEAN FROM U PERFORMANCE RATHER FROM INTRINSIC PLEASURE AND WHEN THEY'RE LEARN A THINKING ABOUT YOU AND ALSO HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN BASIC SKILLS THAT NOT EVERY MAN IS GOING TO PERFORM WELL AT AND SO FOR THE KID THAT SAYS I DON'T LIKE MATH WE AS STILL HAVE YOU'L LEARN IT LIKE WHA YOU MAINT TO APPRECIATE HOW DO YOU NO HOW DO YOU CONJURE UP IN A A JOY OR AN APPRECIATION IN THAT KID I MAN SEEMS I GAN A AHARD THING I MEAN I EVENTUALLY SET MYSELF  ALONG A ACADEMIC TOUR JECTORY UM TO THAT WORKED OUT UM BUT THAT WAS INITIALLY JUST OUT OF PURE FEAR BECAUSE MY LIFE WAS WAS REALLY BAD II MADE CIRCUMSTANCES IN MYSELF MADE IT BAD UM AND I WAS RESCUING MYSELF FROM BASIS OF BECOMING MORE OF A LOSER SO IUS LIKE OCASE SCHOOLS THE THING AND I JI SCHOOL ANDTHAT WAS THAT WAS THE TURN HARDRIGHT INTO INTO ACADEMICS FOR ME BUT WHAT YOU DO FOR THE PERSON WHO OS LIKE REALLY DOESN'T LIKE MATH BECAUSE THEY'RE STRUGGLING WITH IT OR DOESN'T LIKE BIOLOGYOR PSYCHOLOGY ND HOW DO WE HOW DO WE EVOKE A AT LEAST AN APPRECIATION FOR THAT O'M IT SOUNDS LIKE THE EMOTION SYSTEM IS THE KEY SYSTEM TO LEVERAGE IN ORDER TO LEARN AND AND SO COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMOTION AND LEARNING CAUSE I REALIZE THIS IS REALLY THAT THE SANAA OF WHATOF WHAT YOU DO SO I MEAN YOU COULD SAY AT THIS WAY RIGHT SO WHATEVER YOU'RE HAVING EMOTION ABOUT IS WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT AND WHATEVER YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT YOU COULD HOPE TO LEARN ABOUT REMEMBER SOMETHING FROT RIGHT UNDERSTAND DIFFERENTLY SO THE KEY QUESTION FOR EDUCATORS IS WHAT EVERYBODY'S ALWAYS HAVING SOME KIND OF EMOTIONS ALL THE TIME IF UNLESSYOU'RE DEAD RIGHT OR UNCONSCIOUS WHAT ARE PEOPLE'S EMOTIONS ABOUT IN THIS SPACE IF THE EMOTIONS BECAUE WHATEVER THOSE EMOTIONS ABOUT THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE LEARNING ABOUT SOF THE EMOTIONS ARE ABOUT THE OUT COMES DID I GET IT RIGHT AMONG THE FLONK AND DIK AN THEY PLAS I'MSELF SMARD I'SEE TO PID WIT ANY ONE OF THOSE RIGHT IF THOSE ARE THE MAIN DRIVERS THEN THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE LEARNING ABOUT IF THE EMOTIONS ARE ABOUT THE ACTUAL IDEAS IN PLAY THE MATH THE PHYSICS THO WHY DOES THE BALL ROLL DOWN THE RAMP WAIT A MINUTE THAT'S THE SAME AS WHY THE MOON GOES AROUND AR YOU DON' IT MEAN LIKE THERE ARE RIGHT WHEN THE EMOTIONS ARE ABOUT IDEAS THEN WHAT YOU'RE ENGAGING WITH IS LEARNING ABOUT IDEAS AND SO WHAT I WOULD ARGUE IS THAT IN SETTING UP THE KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM WE HA AVE WE HAVE TAUGHT PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE E MOTION SHOULD BE ABOUT THESE HIGH STAKES ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES WHICH MEANS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LEARNING HOW TO THINK ABOUT PERFORM PERFORM NOT HOW TO THINK ABOUT THE IDEAS NOT THE INTRINSIC POWER OF USING MATH TO UNDERSTAND THE WORLD IN A DIFFERENT WHY SO HOW DO YOU ENGAGE KIDS RIGHT YOU ENGAGE KIDS BY SETTING OUT WHICH PROBLEM SPACES THAT IN PROBLEMS THAT INVITE THEM TO TRY TO ENGAGE WITH SOMETHING THAT PIQUES YOUR CURIOSITY THAT'S MEANINGFUL TO THEM OR HAVE THEM BRING IN WHAT THE KID REALLY ATES IT LIKE WHAT IS IT THAT YOU DO FIND INTERESTING KID WRIGT START THERE START THERE AND START USING YOUR YOUR ACADEMIC SKILLS IN A WAY THAT WILL GIVE OU POWER TO DO WHAT IT IS YOUR INTERESTED IN DOING THAT'S THE WAY IN USE YOUR WRITING USE YOUR MATH USE YOUR PERSUASIVE ARGUMENT SKILLS USE YOUR FILM MAKING SKILLS WHATEVER IT IS TO TELL THE STORY OF SOMETHING THAT U FIND DEEPLY MEANINGLY POWERFUL TO UNDERSTAND AND ALL THE SUDDEN OU NEED THE MATH KID'S ACTUALLY SAY THINGS LIKE THAT THERE'S THIS LOVELY EM THERE'S THIS LOVELY A A LONG QUOTE FROM A FROM A SUDNE'S EMIGRANT KID IN IT ONE OF THESE NEW YORK SCHOOLS AH WITH THE PERFORMANCE ASSESSMEANTS AM A IN A IN AN ARTICLE I WROTE WITH A CALLINGAM DUG CONNECT AM THE THE ARTICLE IS CALLED BUILDING MEANING BUILDS TEAN'S BRAIN THO CONFINDED ITS END IN EDUCATIONAL EADERSHIP THERE'S A BIG LONG QUOTE FROM THIS KINAPAN AND HE'S BASICALLY EXPLAINING WHAT MATH CLASS MEANT TO HIM WHICH HE HAD NEVER PASSED A MAUTH CLASS BEFORE AND HE SAYS YE GOT THIS PROBLEM CALLED WALKING TO THE DOOR WHICH IS BASILYZENO'S PARADOX THAT YOU GET HALF WAY TO THE OOR HALF WAY TO TH OOR HALFWAY THER YOU EVER GET TO THE DOOR WHY OR WHY NOT WRIGHT AND THEY SPENT MONTHS LEARNING THE MATH THAT WOULD HELP THEM GET AT THAT PROBLEM AND HE TALKS ABOUT HOW I HAD A PROBLEM HE SAYS AND I HAD TO LEARN FRACTIONS I HAD TO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM I HAD AND AS I ENGAGED WITH FRACTIONS AND THAT PROBLEM I GOT FASCINATED HE SAYS BY FINITE AND INFINITE AND THESE IDEAS WE'RE DRIVING MY NEED TO LEARN TO DO FRACTIONS RIGHT SO WE'VE GOT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE A'M NOT SAYING YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEARN MATH OR YOU DON'T AVE TO LEARN TO READ A WRITER OR OR DO ALL THESE OTHER KINDS OF SKILLS BUT WE MAKE THOSE WHICH IS IN THE HORSE'S CART UKNOW WHAT'S IN THE CART WE CALL THAT THE THE MATRICK OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM ANY AIM OF IT WHEN IN FACT IT'S THE QUALITY OF THE HORSE CAN THAT HORSE CALL THE THING RIGHT THAT'S THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PERSON AND WHAT THEY PUT IN THEIR CART THEN SERVES THAT DEVELOPMENT IT'S THE TULKED OF WAYS OF KNOWING AN UNDERSTANDING THAT COME WITH YOU AS YOU MOVE INTO THE WORLD BUT THIS TAKES REAL REAL DEVELOPMENTAL SKILL ON THE PART OF EDUCATORS RIGHT WHO ARE NOT SUPPORTED OR OR OR RESOURCE OR TRAIN TO THINK ABOUT DEVELOPMENT IN THESE WAYS AND MEANS YOU ASKED WHEN DOES TIS FALL OFF IT REALLY DEPENDS IN WHAT SCHOOL SYSTEM YOU ARE AND IN WHAT DEMOGRAPHIC YOU ARE WHEN IT FALLS OFF BUT FOR ALMOST EVERYBODY EXCEPT FOR THE PRIVILEGE FEW A WHO ARE IN VERY PROGRESSIVE ALTERNATIVE SCHOOLS IT FALLS OFF BY ADOLESCENCE WHICH IS WHEN SCHOOL GET SERIOUS AND IS ALSO IRONICALLY WEN DEVELOP MENTALLY KIDS ARE DEVELOPING THE NURL CAPACITY AND THE PSYCH OF SOCIAL CAPACITY AND THE DRIVE TO IN FUR COMPLEX NARRATIVE MEANING FROM THE THINGS THEY ARE DOING YOU KNOW THESE AREN'T JUST MY SHOES THESE ARE A STATEMENT ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT I BELIEVE ABOUT SUSTAIN ABILITY AND ABOUT SPORTS AND ABOUT ADULTS AND COUNTER CULTURE AT RIGHT AND AS WE GROW INTO A SPACE S WHERE WE'RE DRIVEN TO TRY TO YOU KNOW CHALLENGE AND THINK ABOUT BIG MEANINGS AND GAGE WITH PERSPECTIVES AND EMOTIONS AND SOCIAL ISSUES AND BROAD IMPORTANT EXISTENTIAL QUESTIONS BE THEY IN PHYSICS OR BE THEY IN ART OR BE THEY IN THE SOCIAL CIVIC DOMAIN RIGHT WHAT D' WE DO WE DOUBLE DOWN UNCONTROLLING THE IN PT AND THE OUTPUT TRANSACTIONAL MECHANISMS THAT COUNT AS QUOTE ON QUOTE ACADEMIC RIGOR AND ACHIEVEMENT RIGHT WE START TO ASK HEDS YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE THE THE SERVANT WHO SHOWS UP IN THE SCENE AND AN IN GREAT EXPECTATIONS RIGHT AS IT MOLLY OR IS IT MARIE A RIGHT AND IT'S YOU'RE LIKE WHO THE HECK NOS AND THAT IS NOT THE POINT OF LEADING GREAT EXPECTATIONS RIHT WE TAKE AWAY BECAUSE WE'RE AFRAID AS EDUCATORS AS SOCIETY WE'VE GOT THIS NARRATIVE AROUND YOUNG PEOPLES AND A PARTICULAR BUT EVERY ONES PROPENSITY TO BUILD AND CONSTRUCT MEANING IN THESE SPACES AND SELF IN THESE SPACES THAT AGENCY FRIGHTENS US BECAUSE WE'RE WORRIED THEY'REGOING TO TAKE RISTS THEY'RE GONG TO DO SOMETHING STUPID DAR GOIN A THEY'RE GOING TO FALL OFF THE TRACK THEY'RE GOING TO NOT MAKE IT IN THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEM AND IN TRYING TO PROTECT THEM AND SHIELD THEM FROM THEIR OWN CURIOSITIES THEIR OWN DISPOSITIONS FOR MEANING MAKING WE I WOULD ARGUE ACTUALLY STUNT THEIR ABILITY TO GROW THEMSELVES TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE MENTAL HEALTH CRISES LITERALLY CRISES IN IN MENTAL HEALTHRIGHT NOW AND ADOLESCENCE A CROSS DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS TIS ESPECIALLY BAD IN YOUNG GIRLS AS IAN YET YES THAT'S RIGHT BUT BUT BUT ATAT IS EVERYBODY AND IT'S WORSE THAN GIRLS YES WE DON'T FULLY UNDERSAND WHY THAT IS AM I GET SOM I IN A SUGGESTIONS I YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE REALLY DOING IS ACTUALLY PRODUCING PEOPLE WHO ARE GUDDED OF THEIR OWN INNER DRIVE TO BECOME SOMEONE WHO THINKS POWERFULLY IN THE SPACE OF THE WORLD WE ARE FRIGHTENED TO LET OUR YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE THAT POWER WHICH IS THE ROLE OF ADULTS IS TO RAP AROUND YOUNG PEOPLE AND HELP THEM LEARN TO TO BE REFLECTIVE TO BESYSTEMATIC TO BE RIGOROUS WITH THEMSELVES AS THEY DE VELOP THE CAPACITIES AND DISPOSITIONS TO DECONSTRUCT THEIR OWN BELIEFS TO DECONSTRUCT THEIR OWN AIMS AND GOALS AND THE WAYS THEY UNDERSTAND THE WORLD AND TO REBUILD THEM ITERATIVELY OVER AND OVER IN THIS IN THIS SERINTELLECTUALLY HUMBLE CURIOUS WAY WHERE WERE CONSTANTLY QUARYING OURSELVES CONSTANTLY QUARING OTHER PEOPLE WHERE WE'RE WILLING TO SIT WITH UNCERTAINTY IN COMPLEX PROBLEM SPACES AND THINK THROUGH THE POSSIBILITIES RATHER THAN SETTLE QUICKLY ON TO ONE SOLUTION WHAT DOES SCHOOL EXPECT YOU TO DO SETTLE IMMEDIATELY ON TO ONE SOLUTION WHICH BY THE WASE THE SOLUTION I ARETY HAD IN MIND WHEN I GAVE YOU THE QUESTION I AS COMPARED TO SITTING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE AND ALLOWING THEM THE IN SAFE AND APPROPRIATE WAYS THE SPACE IN WHICH TO ACTUALLY GRAPPLE WITH COMPLEX POWERFUL QUESTIONS WHEN KIDS DEVELOP THE PROCLIVITIES TO DO THAT THEY LEARN HOW TO MANAGE THOSE VERY HUMAN CAPACITIES THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE WHOLE TIME THAT CAN LEAD TO IN A TERRIBLE EVIL AS WELL AS AMAZING VIRTUOUSNESS THEY LEARN TO APPRECIATE AND MANAGE THOSE CAPACITIES WITHIN THEIR OWNSELVES I THINK SO MUCH OF WHAT WE SEE IN TERMS OF THESE INFAILURE TO LAUNCH EXAMPLES ARE ARE CAUSE I KNOW SOME OF THESE THE CHILDREN OF FRIENDS EM REALLY REALLY SMART KIDS THAT DIDN'T MAP WELL TO THE SYSTEM AND THEREFORE ARE NOT DOING WELL REALLY STRUGGLING AND EM CLEARLY HAVE THE INTELLECTUAL POWER IT JUST WASN'T SERVED UP TO THE A INUTE A SCHOOL WASN'T SERVED UP TO THEM IN A WAY  THE T YET ATS IT SAYS AS MUCH ABOUT THE SYSTEM AS IT DOES ABUT THI KET  E II I TEACH A COURSE IT I'M STAMFORD TO THE MEDICAL STUDENTS THAT EVERY FIRST YOUR MEDICAL STUDENT TAKES ABOUT NERE SCIENCE IT'S TEAM TAUHT IT'S A PHENOMENAL CORTIAL IM BECAUSE OF THE THE RANGE OF EXPERTESTE I IN THE TEACHING I'M THAT COMES THROUGH AND WONE THING I'VE NOTICED IM IS THAT THE THEY'RE ALL PHENOMENAL TEACHERS IM BUT THE BEST INSTRUCTORS I'M DO TWO THINGS SIMULTANEOUSLY WHEN THEY TEACH A FIRST OF ALL THEY COME TO THE TABLE WITH INCREDIBLE EXPERT TESE OBVIOUSLI YOU A THESE ARE LEAI AN A  TAND WIT YO HYING TO GET AT IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO ENGAGE THEM IDEAS YET THEY ARE TRUE LUMINARIES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE FIELDS A DICTION PAIN A MEMORY I EVERY SYSTEM OF THE OF THE THE BO BODY AND BRAIN THAT RELASE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM I'S TAUGHT IN THIS COURSE BUT THAT I'VE NOTICED EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THAT I THERE'S A SUBSET OF THEM THAT AS THEY TEACH FROM THAT POSITION OF EXPERT TISE NOT ONLY ARE THEY CLEAR NOT ONLY ARE THEY ENGAGING NOT ONLY ARE THEIR SLIDES IM SPARSE ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND BUT RICH ENOUGH TO INCLUDE ALL THE RELEVANT DETAIL BUT THEY ALSO FLIP BACK AND FORTH I FROM THE POSITION OF EXPERT TO THE POSITION OF NOVICE LEARNING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME NAT ALLOS THAT INTELLECTUAL CURIOSITY THAT THEIR KEEPING A LOT THEY HAVE THIS DISPOSITION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YALTIVATING SIT IC E O NO A PLEASED TO UM AS ACADEMICS WERE FAMILIAR WITH THAT RIGHT THE I INS ARE UP  TER A AND AND THE LAN GAVE OF ACADEMICS INTERRUPTING ME IS IT IS A SIGN OF INTEREST I DNT CAROL THE CAROL DECK WAS THE ONE  THAT SA O GAS IS RIGHT AND SHE'S RIGHT CARICTERA 'S RIGHT I THE GREAT CARROLL TOEK  AND SO AM BUT I'VE SEEN THIS ESPECIATE SO YOU KNOW THAT THERE'RE SOME TOPICS THAT IM YO I LIKE TO THINK THAT I'M I MIGHT DO THIS REFLECTIVELY FOR BECAUSE LIKE FOR INCAS I I START OFTEN NERAL DEVELOPMENT AND I ADORE THE TOPIC SO I CAN'T TEACH NERAL DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT BEING COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY IN THE POSITIVE SENSE OF HOWA BRAIN DEVELOP YE IE STILL NEVER CAUGHT O THE TR I ON A PODCAST ON IT UM BECAUSE IT INTENDS TO REQUIRE VISUALS UM AND WE DON'T USE THOSE AN IN THE BECAUSE THE PODCASTS MUST BEOPLE LISTEN TO THE PODCAST EM BUT MAYBE I'LL DO SOMETHING JUST FOR YOU TO BUT SOME POINT BUT THET EI THINK IT'S THI THE SAME EXPERIENCE OCCURS WHEN I SEE SOMEBODY UM LIKE A DOCTOR SHAHN MACKY WHO RUNS OUR OUR PAIN CLINNIC ET SANFORD TEACH ABOUT PAIN IN THE SYSTEMS OF THE BODY THAT RELATE TO PAIN AND EMOTION AND HOW TO CURE CERTAIN FORMS OF PAIN ET CETERA TREAT PAIN IT'S LIKE HE'S HE'S CLEARLY THE WORLD EXPERT BUT THE WAY HE DESCRIBES A SYSTEM YOU CAN TELL HE'S HE'S LEARNING IT AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN PARALLELS ALL THAT AND I FEEL LIKE THAT EM IGNITES THE EMOTIONAL SYSTEMS OF THE LEARNERS BRAIN IN SUCH A POWERFUL WAY UM THAT IS DISTINCT FROM JUST HEARING AN EXSPERT TALK ABOUT SOMETHING HE'S NOT RELAYING HE'S NOT A SQUIRREL WITH NOTS AN GIVING ALL THE NUTS TO THE KITS HE'S INVENTING THE KNOWLEDGE IN FUN OF THAT RIGHT THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO PUT IT UM AS USUAL UM OTHERS ARE MORE SUSCINCT AND COLLECTING MY IDEAS THEN AND EXPRESSING THEM THAN I AM UM SO I THINK THAT'S IT THAT'S A POWERFUL THING I WENT TO A HIGH SCHOOL THAT'S A HAS A KIND OF A SPLIT REPUTATION IT'S IT'S KNOWN AS BEING ONE OF THE BEST PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY IT'S ALSO THE IGH SCHOOL THAT AT LEAST FOR A WHILE AND ONE OF THE HIGH SUICIDE WRITES IN THE COUNTRY I A'S WRITTEN UP IN VERY I NEWSPAPERS AN A AND SO ON UM AND SO MUCH SO THAT NOWADAYS THEY FORBID THE KIDS THERE FROM MEETING A MORE THAN AN HOUR BEFORE SCHOOL TO PRACTICE FOR THE STANDARDISED TEST BY THE WAY WHEN I WAS AT SCHOOL THE ONLY THING THAT SCHOOL REPRESENTED FOR ME IN HIGH SCHOOL WAS M SOMETHING CANE BETWEEN BREAKFAST AND SCAPEBORDING AND A LOT AND FRANK THAT I WASN'T IN SCHOOL A LI AND I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT KIDS GO TO SCHOOL STAY IN SCHOOL I I MISSED A LIEH I HAD HAVELLED ALL IHAD A LOT AT ALL TIMES OF YEAWEARD THINGS I'D A LOTE OF MAKING UP TO DO IN AND COLLEGE EM AS A CONS GOEN SO STANSI WILL GET THE BASICS UM BUT THIS ACTUALLY WHERE I'D LIKE TO GO YOU HAVE A VERY INTERESTING TRAJECTORY HERE ARE YOU UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR YOU IUM STUDY MOTION AND LEARNING AND MANY OTHER THINGS ACROSS CULTURES AN IM ADOLESCENCE AN AND AND SO MANY OTHER IMPORTANT TOPICS BUT IM YOU ARE NOT A STORY OF OF LIKE GROWING UP IN AN ACONEMIC FAMILY YOU GROW P ON A FARM UM YOU MAN SORT OF JENTLEMAN'S FARM MY DAD WAS A SURGE AND BUT WE HAD ANIMALS AND A FARM AND TRIED MY PARENTS TRIED TO HAVE US YOU NOW GROWING THE THINGS WE ATE YOU'VE HAD A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES THAT WERE TYING OUT BEFORE WE STARE RECORDING BUT BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU MENTION WAS GETTING AM INVOLVED IN EDUCATION IM WHERE YOU WORKS EXPOSED TO STUDENTS OF WHO HAD VERY DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS IN YOU UM MAYBE OU JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT I'M STO OF THE NOTES OF YOUR EXPERIENCE Y YOU GROW UP ON THIS FARM AND THEN MAYBE JUST HIT SOME OF THE OTHER NOTES AND AND THENLESS LET'S TAKE A FORE IN TO WHEN YOU FIRST GOT EXPOSED TO EDUCATING OTHERS YUM AND BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT BACKDROP FOR WHAT WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HERE AN SERVES AS A JUMPING OFF POINT FOR WHERE I'D LIKE TO GO NEXT I'LL JUST JU MEN I MAN IT'S ALWAYS HARD T HIK BY YOURSELF I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING IND WHAT'S NOT I MANSEIS ME I I THINK WHAS INTERESTING AS IS KNOWING YOU KNOW WHERE Y WHERE YOU'VE BEEN IN THINGS IT THAT THAT MARKED THAT MAPPED BACK TO YOUR EMOTIONAL YES A ID NETWORKS IN A WAY THAT FOR YOU FEEL LIKE  THAT MATTERED INTERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW AS A LITTLE KID I REMEMBER EVEN AS A LITTLE KID NOT LIKING SCHOOL I WAS VERY GOOD KID WAS VERY WELL BEHAVED KID I WENT TO A DECENT PUBLIC SCHOOL I'M BUT JUST THE WHOLE IDEA OF IT I JUST ALWAYS FELT LIKE I HAD TWO LEFT FEET I AD NEVER FELT LIKE IT WAS REALLY ME THERE I WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO ESKAPE A ABT YOU KNOW AND I MEAN AND THINKING ABOUT WHEN I FIRST TOD EDUCATING OTHERS AND LIKE MY FIRST MEMORY OF EDUCATIN OTHERS LIKE SPECIFICALLY THAT COMES TO MIND IS I WAS SIX AND I WENT ON A LITTLE VACATION IN THE SUMMER TO STAY WITH MY COUSINS IN PETASKY MICHIGAN I'M WHICH IS A PLACE ON LIKE MICHIGAN WHERE THERE ARE THESE I'M STONES WHERE THERE'S MY UNDERSTANDING FROM WHAT I WAS SIX IS THAT THERE ARE THESE LIKE TWO HUNDRED MILLION YEAR OLD FOSSILIZED WORMS IN THESE STONES AND YOU CAN SEE HIM WHEN YOU LOOK AT THERES LIKE LITTLE WORMS AND YOU CAN SEE HIM YET SO I JUST WAS FASCINATED BY THESE STONES THAT THESE ARE ACTUAL FOSSILIES TWO HUNDRED MILLION YEAR OLD WORMS AND I DON'T NOFF THAT NUMBERS CRA THAT'S WHAT I REMEMBER FROM AGE SIX SOM SOME PALIINTOE SAID THER CON CRET I'M BUT I COLLECTED THESE STONES AND I WENT TO THE LITTLE LOCAL A EXHIBIT THEY HAD AT THE LIBRARY WHATEVER AND I LEARNED ABOUT THESE STONES AND I BROUGHT SOME BACK AND SOMEHOW SOMEBODY THOUGHT TO ASK ME TO TEACH MY SECOND GRATE CLASS WHEN I STARTED SCHOOL ABOUT THESE STONES AND I JUST REMEMBER O'MHOW I GOT ASKED ED TO THIS BUT I REMEMBER STANDING IN FRONT OF MY CLASS AND TALKING ABOUT THESE STONES AND JUST LOOKING AROUND THE ROOM AND SUDDENLY NOTICING YOU KNOW THAT FEELING WHEN YOU'RE LECTURING AND YOU THINK OH MY GOD THEY'RE FASCINATED BY WHAT I'M SAYING LIKE EVERY KID IS LOOKING AT ME IN LIKE O YOU KNOW LIKE AND I WAS SOMEMIT RIGHT I'LL KEEP GOING ILL TO YOUS MORE ABOUT THESE STONES AND I PASSED HIM AROUND WHATEVER AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN O K BECAUSE I WAS THEN ASKED TO GIVE THAT TALK OLDLY UP TO THE FIFTH GRATERS WHO ARE WAY OLDER THAN ME AN WERERASSER AR IALREADY FASCINATED BY THE NATURAL WORLD AND ABLE TO LIKE MAKE MEANING OUT OF SOMETHING IN A WAY THAT INSPIRED OTHER PEOPLE IF I CAN BE SO BLONT TUS TO SAI AND YET I WAS CONSTANTLY IN TROUBLE AT SCHOOL FOR NOT HAVING MY HOMEWARK LIKE I WAS JUST YOU KNOW THE FEELING OF RELEASE ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND THE FEELING OF DREAD ON SUNDAY EVENING IS HARD TO LIKE DESCRIBED YOU KNOW AND I WENT TO AE REASONABLY WHILE RESOURCE SCHOOL YOU KNOW I'M ANYWAY FAST FORWARD UP TO ONE I WAS OLDER I MEAN I I WAS JUST ALWAYS FASCINATED BY AN I THINK SOME OF HIS COME FOM MY MOB TO I'M TRYING TO Y NO SPEAK DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ENGAGE WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE DIFFERENT THAN MYSELF JUST HAVE CONVERSATION SO FROM THE TIME I WAS OLD ENOUGH TO BARELY QUALIFID TO DO THESE PROGRAMS MY PARENTS HAD THE THE RESOURCES LUCKILY TO BE ABLE TO LET ME TO DO THESE THINGS BUT I YOU KNOW I WENT OFF TO FRANCE AND STAYED ON A FARM THERE FOR A SUMMER AND WENT TO I YIN IRELAND I WENT TO RUSHI BY THE SOME I WAS EIGHTEEN I WAS WORKING OT THESE LITTLE KIDS OFF THE STREET AND IN CAMPING WITH THEM IN SOUTHERN SIBERIA AND ALL THESE KINDS OF THINGS WHEN I WAS COLD AS THEY SAY IN SIEREAS GLOOMY AND RAINY AND MUDDY AND COLD YES I YA SIBERIA WAYS SOUND SO BLEAK OH I TEREAS TREALLY MANY TIMES TO SEND ME THERE O YD NOW THAT'S THE REAL THREAT IM JUS BEAUTIFUL IN MANY WAYS BUT I'M YE THIS THET WAS SAD IT WAS A SAD SAD STORY I'M ANYWAY IM YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO WAS ACTUALLY LEARN BY DOING BY BEING BY ENGAGING WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO KNEW THINGS I DIDN'T LEARNING HOW TO YOU KNOW I BUILD THINGS I'M WAS ALWAYS REALLY INTERESTED IN WARD WORKING AND BOAT BUILDING I WENT TO KENION SPEND EIGHT MONTHS THERE AS AN UNDERGRADUATE RIT DOCUMENTING THESE TRADITIONAL DA CONSTRUCTION IN A NORTHERN C EN CONSTRIT DOW TO DI WHICH AR SALE BOATS IM SALE A SALE ABOUT CONSTRUCTION WHEN I DON'T NO ELECTRICITY HAVEN IN CABIN TR A CABINETRY YOU KNOW TO ME HA N THE A IA BUILLA FURNITURE SO WHEN PEOPLE AT AVERY BUILT FURNITURE BUT THEY BASY THEY SEMBLE THE KEY OF FURNITURE T NO OR NOTI A A OLD CABINETS AND ANDBUILTIN BOOKSHELVES AND FURNITURE MEN IRS OM MY FRIENDS HAVE PIECES IE MADE FOR THEM I AV MADYTHING FOR MYSELF SAD O HIM IM BUT I'M I MEAN I THINK I WAS REALLY TORN BETWEEN TRYING TO BUILD THINGS AND LEARN BY ENGAGING WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND IN THESE DIFFERENT CULTURAL SPACES YOU KNOW BEING A WOMAN IN A CABINET IN A CABINET SHOP AN CONNECTICET IS IS REALLY NOT A CULTURAL SPACE THAT I HAD GROWN UP AND AND THEN GO YOU KNOWT I MEAN AND YET RIGT MOVING MYSELF AN CHANGE ING MYSELF TO ADAPT THESE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS SOMEHOW FELT LIKE LEARNING TO ME I THINK AM AND I ENDED UP IN A STRANGE SITUATION WHERE I CUT MY HAND I OPENING A WINDOW AT A JOBSITE AND I NEEDED TO I WAS ON WORKERS COP AND I HAD TO TAKE I'M SOME TIME TO LET IT HEEL AND I COULDN'T RUN MACHINERY SO I HAD TO TOR GOR WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF AND I WAS TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD AND I WAS NOT GOTTO G O BACK TO MY PARENTS FOR MORE MONEY RIT SO THAGT I HAVE TO SUPPORT MYSELF SO I AM I THOUGHT O K I I WENT TO COLLEGE AT I YOU KNOW HIL OF ALL I FEE LEAG SCHOOL AND I I I MAJORED IN FRENCH BECAUSE I I COULD THAT'S MASICLLY WHAT I WAS LIKE I DON'T KNOW I'D BETTER FINISH I DOTER NOT FLOCK I COAN DOFRANCH I KNOW ID I KNOW I SPEAK FRENCH FOOLLY A'LL TO A FRENCH LITTERATREMAJER AND DONE WITH A QUICKLY THEN LIKE WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH MYSELF I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD BE A SCIENTISTS BUT I LOVED SCIENCE SO I JUST WON AROUND TAKING LIKE A YEAR OF EVERY SCIENCE IT TOK A YEAR OF ASTRONOMY AND A YEAR OF BIOLOGY AND A YEAR OF PHYSICS AND A YEAR OF AM YOU KNOW HUMANANTHROPOLOGY PALIANTHROPOLOGY LIKE ALL THESE THINGS PSYCHOLOGY AND REALIZED WHOLLY CRAPT LIKE THIS IS SUPERINTERESTING YOU CAN STUDY HOW BABIES THINK AND AND THE NATURAL WORLD AND THEN ALSO I BE BE BRINGING SORT OF A SCIENTIFIC LENS TO BEAR THAT HELPS YOU UNDERSTAND THINGS IN A NEW WAY SO SO HERE I WAS AS A A TWENTY THREEYEAR OLD WITH A COT HAND AND I THOUGHTWHT AM I GOING TO DO WITH MYSELF I CONVINCED THE MASSACHUSETSPORT OF EDUCATION THAT I YE I HAD THE BACKGROND KNOWLEDGE TO BE ABLE TO I TO TO TEACH SOME YOU KNOW SECTIONS OF A P BIOLOGY AND PHYSICS THAT THEY HAD IN THERE HIGH SCHOOL SO WHEN I GOT TO AM I YOU KNOW I FINALLY GOT AN INTERVIEW WITH THIS YOU KNOW PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT HIMSELF BOSTON WHERE THEY WERE DESPERATE FOR A TEACHER LIKE I'M NOTICING IN THE BOSTON GLOBE OR TWO WEEKS INTO THE SCHOOL YEAR AND YOU STILL DON'T HAVE A TEACHER AND OT A MIN ONE SOULD TAKE ME AND I YOU TO MANAGE TO CONVINCE THE MAS SPORT OF EDUCATION I TO GIVE ME PROVISIONAL TEACHER CERIF ICA TION BASON THE CAR COURSE WORK I'D DONE AND HOW WELL I DID IN THAT COURSE WORK PROSECTED  I WAS REALLY SUPERMOTIVATEDE ID EXTREMELY WELL IN ALL THAT AM AND WHEN I GOT THERE A THEY BASELY SAID WHEN I SHOOD UP FOR THE INTERVIEW YOU KNOW IM ANOTHER THE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER WANTS TO TAKE THOSE APY CLASSES CAN YOU JUST TEACH FOLL TIME SEVENTH GRATE SUHLIKE OK SO I I I YOU KNOW HAD MY FULL CONTANGION OF HUNDRED AND THIRTY KIDS RIDE SEVENTHGRATERS COME THROUGHMY CLASSROOM AND A THE MIDDLE SCHOOL HAD JUST BEEN SHUT DOWN BECAUSETHERE WASN'T SUFFICIENT FUNDING IN THE TOWN FORITS THEY HAD TAKEN THE MIDDLESCHOOL KITS AND PUSHE THEM INTO THE HIGH SCHOOL SPACE A WHAT THAT BASELY MEANT TIS I SUDDENLY FOUND MYSELF IN A HY A FULLY EQUIPPED HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM WITH MICROSCOPES AND ALL KINDS OF SCIENTIFIC EQUIPMENT THAT WOULD BE USED TO TEACH LI LATER COURSES WITH MY SEVENTH GRATERS AND IT ALSO HAPPENED THAT THE MASSACHUSETTS BOARD OF EDUCATION HAD CHANGED THE AM TH ATHE REQUIREMENTS FOR FOR THE WAY THE ORGANIZED SCIENCE INSTRUCTION AND CORRICULUM FROM YOU KNOW SEVENTH GRAD LIFE SCIENCE EIGHS GREAT PHYSICAL SCIENCE WHATEVER WAS E DIFFERENT SCIENCES EACH YEAR THEY WANTED AN INEGRATED IN ER JUSPLONARY SCIENCE ALL THE WAY ACROSS AND OF COURSE THAT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE TRADITIONAL SCIENCE TEACHERS TO DO BECAUSE THEY'D BEEN TEACHING ONLY BIOLOGY OR ONLY OR SCIENCE ARE ONLY PHYSICAL SCIENCE AM FOR THEIR WHOLE CAREER AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TEACH THE OTHER SUBJECTS AND HERE COMES ME WOULD LIKE ONE INTENSIVE YEAR OF STUDY IN EACH OF THESE DOMANS I WAS PERFECTLY SITUATED TO LIKE TRID TO PULL IT TOGETHER SO SOME OF THE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS HELPED ME THANK YOU TO THEM AM AND I BUILT OUT AS A NEW COVERCULUM FOR SEVENTH GRATE FOR THAT DISTRICT AROUND THIS INNER DISCPLINERY APPROACH TO SCIENCE AM TOGETHER WITH OTHER TEACHERS  WASE VERY HANDS ON VERY AND IT WAS VERY MUCH LIKE A WAB OF CONCEPTS YOU KNOW WE'D STUDY NEUWCLER FISION AND ATAMS AND REACTIONS AND THEN THE SUN AND ASTRONOMY IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND THEN AND THEN HOW THE THE ENERGY IS BEING YOU KNOW SHINED OVER UN TO TH A UNDER THE PLANETS AND THE THE EARTH AND THEN THESE ORGANISMS CALLED PLANTS ARE ACTUALL USING THOSE PHOTONS TO DO SOMETHING CHEMICAL LETS TALK ABOUT PHODOSYNTHESIS AND WHEREN'T YOURIGHT AND TEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND BREAKING DOWN SUGARS AND MOLECISM BRIT SO WE BUILT THIS WHOLE WEB LIKE CORRICULON THAT I WAS TRYING TO HELP THE KIDS APPRECIATE THE SORT OF DIYNAMIC COMPLEXITY OF THE NATURAL WORLD AND SOME OF MY PROFESSORS FROM CORNAL ALSO SENT ME A MATERIALS AND ALL KINDS OF COOLSTUFF FROM THE CORNAL MUSEUM THAT THAT THEY DIDN'TREALLY NEED IN THAT I GAVE IT BACK WHEN I WAS DOWN RIPE WITH ALL THESE INSTRUCTIONS WHEN ALL THE STUFF IS ON HOMINAN EVOLUTION AND ASHALEAND HANDAXES IND ALL KINDS OF STUFF SO I BUILT OUT A CRICKUM AROUND ALL THIS STUFF AND I REALIZED TO THE FIRST TIME THAT I WAS IN THIS AMAZINGLY FASCINATING SPACE BECAUSE IT JUST SO HAPPENED THAT THE SCHOOL I WAS WORKING IN WAS ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE CULTURALLY IN THE NATION AT THAT TIME I THINK WE HAD SOMETHING LIKE EIGHTY ONE LANGUAGES SPOKEN OUT OF ELEVEN HUNDRED KIDS SWALE THAT'S A LOT OF FIRST LANGUAGES AND KIDS WERE ARRIVING FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD THIS WAS RIGHT AFTER THE REWANDAN GENASIDE TOOK IDS WERE COMING IN FROM ESTAFRICA THERE WERE REFUGES FROM A COSIVOAN EASTERN EUROPE THERE WERE KIDS COMING IN FROM JAMAICA THERE WERE KIDS COMING AND FROM HADY THERE WERE KIDS FROM MALASIA AND A MEUNMAR LIKE THERE WERE A THERE WERE KIDS LANDING IN THAT CLASS LIKE DEERIN HEADLIGHTS FROM VERY VERY A BROAD RANGES OF CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS AND THEYRE LANDING IN MY SCIENCE CLASS AND WHAT I QUICKLY REALIZED IS THEY WERE USING THESE SCIENTIFIC WAYS OF EXPLORING THE WORLD AND THINKING ABOUT QUESTIONS AND AND TRYING TO A MAKE SENSE OF WHAT THEY HAD WITNESSED TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THEIR OWN SERSELVES THEIR OWN ORIGIN STORY THEIR OWN PLACE IN THE WORLD WHY DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN THIS CLASS LOOKED AND EAT DIFFERENTLY THAN ME DRESSE DIFFERENTLY THEN ME LIKE HOW IS IT THAT YOU LOOK LIKE THAT AND I LOOKD LIKE THIS AND THERE WAS ALL THIS IT CRAZY YOU KNOW ADOLESCEN A TURMOIL LAYRED INTO THIS SPACE WERE KIDS WERE GRABBING ON TO THE SCIENTIFIC WAYS OF KNOWING AS I HANDLE TO TRY TO MAKE SENSE OF WHO THEY ARE AND THOSE KID STARTED ASKING QUESTIONS OF ME I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS ONE GIRL THE BLACK GIRL RAISED HER HAND AND ALL THE OTHER ERS LOOK IN OUR LIKE YAYAYA ASK IT ASK IT I I I LIKE YOU KNOW SHE WAS BEING BRAVE LIKE SHULD TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE SCHOOL I COA YAN'T SAY THAT NO IDAN'T I SAY IT S AND SHE SAID MISSIMORDINO WHY IS IT THAT WHEN WE'RE STUDYING HOMEDED EVOLUTION AND YOU SHOW US THESE THIS NOVA EPISODE WITH EARLY HOMENEDS IN AFRICA WHY DO THEY ALWAYS SHOW THOSE CREATURES LOOKING LIKE THAY AVE DARKSKIN WHY DO THEY ALWAYS LOOK LIKE BLACK PEOPLE AND KNOWS LIKE WELL BECAUSE THEY ARE ON THE QUATER AND YOU NEED THAT LOVEL O MELINON IN YOUR SKIN TO BE ABLE TO ADAPT AND LIVE WITHOUT GETTING SKIN CANCER INTHAT SPACE BUT AND IT OPENED UP THIS AMAZING CLASS DISCUSSION THAT ACTUALLY WENT ON FERMONTS LIKE EVOLVED INTO A WHOLE CORRICULUM THAT WAS BIOLOGY IT WAS CULTURE OF SOCIALITY WHERE WE STARTED TO REALLY UNPACK THE WAYS THAT WE AS HUMANS ARE NATURAL BEINGS IN THE WORLD AND THE WAYS IN WHICH OUR CULTURAL EXPERIENCES ARE EXTENSIONS OF OUR NATURAL WAYS OF ADAPTING AND THAT HAD ME HOOKED I REALIZE THAT THAT I COULD BRING SCIENCE PRITE THE SCIENCE OF ADOLESCENT DEVELOPMENT AND OF LEARNING AND OF EMOTION AND OF CULTURE TOO THIS VERY PRESSING REAL WORLD'S PROBLEM OF HOW DO WE HELP ARE KIDS ACTUALLY FIGURE OUT WHO THEY ARE INVENT THEMSELVES IN THIS INCRAE CRAZY MULTICULTURAL SPACE AND BECOME SCHOLARS AND INTELLECTUALS WHO ENGAGE SYSTEMATIC WITH THE IDEAS ALONG THE WAY AND SO I I TOOK THOSE IDEAS AND I STARD OF GOING TO NIGHT SCHOOL AT HARVARDIC SENSION SCHOOL TO STUDY I'M COGNITIVE NARROW SCIENCE AND TO STUDY A LANGUAGE AND COGNITION AND IN ALL THESE KINDS OF TOPICS AND AND QUICKLY REALIZED LIKE I REALLY NEEDED THIS DEVELOPMENTAL PERSPECTIVE INFUSESTRAED I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND NOT JUST ILD TY SINGS WORKS BUT HOW THEY GOT THAT WAY AND SO I TOOK THAT BACK TO GRAD SCHOOL AT HARFARD AND BEGAN TO STUDY AM I IN O SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AN EMOTIONAL AND COGNITIVES DEVELOPMENT IN KIDS AND AD AND QUICKLY THEY ARE ALSO KIND OF HIT A A WALL WHERE I WAS I WENT BACK TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN WHICH I WORKED AND I WENT BACK TO THE TEACHERS WHO WERE MY CHOLEGUES AND I I WORKED WITH THEM AND I OBSERVED THEIR CLASSES AND I INTERVIEWED THEIR STUDENTS AND WE DID ALL KINDS OF WORK AROUND HOW KIDS WERE BUILDING SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS IN WAYS THAT REFLECTED THEIR CULTURAL CONCEPTS AND WAYS OF APPROACHING THE WORLD AND I I QUICKLY REALIZED YOU KNOW IT SEEMS TO ME THAT KIDS ARE DOING ALL THIS MEANING MAKING AND WE AS ADULTS ARE DOING ALL THIS I ALL THI SUPPORTIVE YOU KNO MEANING MAKING WERE ALSO ENGAGING AND GROWING AND LEARNING IN WAYS THAT REFLECT NOT JUST OU KNO KNOWLEDGE BITS LIKE LITTLE COMPUTERS BUT ALSO THAT REFLECT THE BIOLOGICAL SUBSTRAIT ON WHICH THE LEARNING AND THE THINKING ARE HAPPENING AND I WANTED VERY MUCH TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE COULD USE AND LAVERAGE DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY AS A KIND OF A CONSTRAINT TO FROM WHICH TO APPRECIATE THE KINDS OF THORETICAL FRAMES WE WERE INVENTING IN THE IN THE REAL WORLD SO TO ANTHROPOLOGICAL EDUCATIONAL SPACE THE DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGICAL SPACE HOW COULD THESE TWO SYSTEMS YOU KNOW I ACT AS A VENDIAGRAM AND HOW COULD THE INNER SECTION BETWEEN THEM THE PLACES WHERE THE THEORIZING ABOUT THE NATURAL BEHAVIORS AND THE WAKEKIDS WERE MAKING MEANING AND LEARNING AND DESCRIBING THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND ENGAGING WITH EACH OTHER ON THE ONE HAND AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE BRAIN AND THE B IOLOGY ARE ENGAGING IN OUR SUPPORTING THOSE PROCESSIES ON THE OTHER HAND THE PLACES WHERE THOSE TWO CIRCLES WOULD OVERLAP THIT SEEMED TO ME THAT WAS WHERE WE COULD MOST A DIRECTLY TARGET TO START TO DEEPLY UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF OUR DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHO BIOLOGICAL GROWTH THEMSELVES AND SO I SET OUT TO TRY TO STUDY ABOUT AM THE WAYS IN WHICH CULTURE AND SOCIALITY SHAPE THE BRAIN AH AND PHYSIOLOGY AND AND SURVIVAL MECHANISMS AND DEVELOPMENT AND AT THAT TIME WHICH WASN'T EVEN THAT LONG AGO YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE TWO DECADES AGO QUICKLY REALIZE AM VERY VERY LITTLE WAS KNOWN YOU KNOW ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH EMOTIONS BEYOND THINGS LIKE FEAR YET I'D FLASH OF SNAKE IN YOUR FACES AND YOU'RE MINTAL ALIGHTS UPRIGHT LIKE I WAS THINKING OF SOMETHING ALOTTO MORE NEW ANCS DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN LIKE WHAT ON SEEING HAPPENING IN SCIENCE CLASS AMONG A KID FROM COSOVOIN A KID FROM AWANDAAS THERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY THEY UNDERSTAND HOW THEY LOOK DIFFERENT RIGHT AT THOSE DEEPLY EMOTIONAL CONVERSATIONS THEY'RE HAVING BUT THEY'RE NOT SO CUT AND DRY AS THE THINGS WE HAD BEEN STUDYING AND SO THAT'S WHAT REALLY DROVE ME TO TRY TO START TO UNDERSTAND IN AN INEGRATED WAY THE WAY IN WHICH ORE OUR BIOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT AND OUR PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ARE ACTUALLY SORT OF TWO SIDES OF WHO WE ARE AND OF HOW WE'RE ORGANIZING OURSELVES TO BUILD CAPACITY A MENTAL CAPACITY AS WELL AS SORT OF PHYSICAL HEALTH AND CAPACITY OVER OVER THE COURSE OF OUR LIVES AS WERE ENGAGING WITH LIVING INCREDIBLE AM A STORY AND FORRAY INTO WHAT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE REALLY A EURABILITY TO IDENTIFY HOW THE UNIVERSALS AMONG US LIKE THE UNIVERSAL BIOLOGICAL FEATURES THE UNIVERSAL PSYCHOLOGICAL BEATURES CAN REALLY STRONGLY IN FORM SPECIFICALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IN A CLASS ROM INTERACTION IN THE MIND OF AN OF A OF YOU OR SOMEBODY ELSE OR OF ANY OF US BUT TO APPROACRIITE FROM THE OTHER DIRECTION IN OTHER WORDS TO TAKE WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW AND SAY WHY IS WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW HAPPENING YEAS O IS IT AS TAND IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING UNDERNEATH THE SIRS A A BEHEGGO RIHT AS SUPPOSED TO SAYING OCAT THIS IS A THIS IS THE PSYCHOLOGO CHARACTER STRUCTURE THIS IS THE BIOLOGY OF THE HYPOTHALMUS BUT RATHER SAY YOU KNOW IS ANY ONE ELSE REALLY UM SHOCKED ABOUT THE A SCHOOL SHOOTING IN ASHVILL AND GO THROUGH THE THE FEELING OF SHOCKE AND AND GO FROM THERE TO THE BIOLOGY AS A ROUTE OF LEARNING AGET AND OF COURSE I DON'T WANT TO TAKE AWAY ANYTHING FROM THE REAL WORLD UM SERIOUSNESS OF THAT  YET BUT BUT IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU YOU SAW THAT THERE'STHAT THERE'S A DIFFERENT PORTAL THROUGH WHICH TO TEACH AND UNDERSTAND EXPERIENCEING THAT WE ARE ALL BUT ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE REALLY TIED TO OUR EMOTIONAL STATES AS THA AS THE MEAN UM FILTERS I WHICH WE LIKE THAT JUST LIKE THAT AND THEREFORE MAKE DECISIONS AND MOVE THROUGH LIFE AN MEN I THINK IT'S SO KEY THAT EARLY ONUMAND IF WE LIKE A TEACHER OFTENTIMES WE LIKE THE SUBJECT IF WE UM HAPPEN TO FALL IN LOVE WITH YOUNA FIGURE FOR B IN A PAPER GRAY AN THAT'S NOT IS THAT'S NOT HOW I WENT THROUGH GRADUATE SCHOOL I JUST WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THE FACT THAT SPERM MEATS EGG YOU GET A MUNCH OF SELF DUPLICATIONS AND THEN AND THEN YOU GET A BRININ A BRAIN THI YE BRAIN FRID HOW DOES THAT HAV AS  AY AND CRAZE AMAZING AND I W HAVE LASTED WITH A GRADUATE ADVISER WHO LITERALLY TOLD ME THIS IS OUTWORKS IN MY LAB IS WHAT SHE SAID A SHE SAID UM WE HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NED HERE I'LL HELP YOU IF YOU NEED HELP BUT BASLY YOU'RE GIN A MESSAROUNDAL STUFF YOU'RE KNOCKING A BURN DOWN THE LAB YOU'RE NOCKIN I KILL YOUR SELF WITH ANY OF THE POISONOUS STUFF UM BUT THEN YOUREAN LIKE MESSUM STUFF UP AND AND DO SOME STUFFING IN A FIGURESOME STUFF OUT THIS WAS LITERALLY THE DESCRIPTION AND AND I LIKED HER LAB BECAUSE THAT GREEN COUNTERTOPS AND SHE HAD PICTURES OF INTERESTING ANIMALS ON THE WALL AND THEN SHE SAID AND I'MA OVE TWO KIDS WHILE YOU'RE IN GRADUATE SCHOOLS SO'M NOT CAN BE ROUND VERY MUCH SHEU GOT TO FIGURE IT OUT ON YOUR OWN AND I SAID  CANNO PLAY THE MUSIC I WANT SHE SAID SURE AND I SAID CAN I PUT TINFOIL ON THE WINDOWS CAUSE I WANT TO BE BOTHERED AND SHE SAID SURE AND ALL SIY OO KA THIS IS THE PLACE FOR ME IN OTHER WORDS SHE GAVE ME A ROOM TO EXPLORE OF COURSE SHE GAVE ME A LOT OF GUIDANCE ALONG THE WASHES AMAZING AMAZING GRADRVIZ ARM EXTR EXTREMELY BLESSE BUT IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THE THAT IDENTIFYING WHAT'S THE WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON NOW IS KEY AND THAT THE OTHER THING THAT'S KEY IS IN OPENNESS TO IDEAS I MEAN EARLIER YOU TALKED ABOUT UM ON OF THE LITS JUST LESS JUST ADMIT WHERE WE'RE OUT RINOWURNIC WE'RE IN I CULTURE WAR RIGHT NOW IA WERE IT'S FACE  NOW IT'S VERY DEVISIVE M AND ONE OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS IS THAT WE CAN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT THINGS I MEAN I THINK UM FEAR OF GETTING CANCELED FEAR OF UM EXPLORING IDEAS IS REAL IT'S VERY REAL NOT JUST FOR ACADEMICS IT'S JUST REAL PEOPLE ARE SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE SENSITIVE TO THE EXPERIENCES OF OTHERS ABSOLUTELY BUT IF WE CAN'T ACTUALLY EXPLORE IDEAS AND FEEL LIKE WE CAN WALK OUT OF THE ROOM SAFELY THEN WE CAN'T REALLY EXPLORE IDEAS AND SO UM I THINK RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT JUST SOCIAL MEDIA I THINK IT'S THE FEAR OF OFFENDING ANYBODY UM AN AND PROBABLY THE FEAR OF A VOICING HOW UPSET CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES OR EXPERIENCES OF OTHERS WHATEVER IT IS I I DON'T SEE A LANDSCAPE RIGHT NOW WHERE THERE IS TRUE OPEN EXPLORATION OF N IDEAS ANYWHEREANYWHERE AT LEAST IN THIS COUNTRY SO UM WHATA WE DO IF THERE IF THE  IF AT LEAST TWO OF THE REQUIREMENTS ARE UM YOU KNOW AN EMOTIONAL GRIPPING OF OF SOMETHING AROUND THE LEARNING UM PLUSS AN OPENNESS TO THINKING ABOUT THINGS THAT MAYBE WE DON'T FEEL RIGHT TO US AS AS A WAY TO LEARN HOW TO THINK SOMETHING I THINK WE BOTH AGREE IF I MAY THAT IS REALLY CRITICAL UM AND THAT THE WORLD WILL BE A FAR BETTER PLACE IF PEOPLE COULD DO THAT UM IN HOW DO WE NAVIGATE THIS LANDSCAPE I MEAN IT IS WHAT HAS TO COME FIRST A A DEMONSTRATION OF THE VALUE OF OPENNESS AN THIT OF IDEAS AND HERE I I ALL JUST STATE MY STANDSIDE I FEEL LIKE ANY IDEA SHOULD BE OPENED TO AT LEAST DISCUSSION ANY IDEA BUT THEN IT NEEDS TO BE SYSTEMATICALLY DISSECTED WITH SOME RIGOR SO THAT PEOPLE CAN'T JUST ASSUME ANY IDEA IS TRUE YOURE ANY AS O MER YE BECAUSES JUST CAUSE IT'S TRUE FOR THEM I'M AND THIS I ASHALY LEARNED FROM MY GRADUATE ADVISER YOU SH USED TO SAY YOU KNOW TOLERANCE HAS TO GO BOTH WAYS THAKE WHEN IT COMES TO THINKING ABOUT IDEAS AND CRITICISING IT CAN'T JUST BE ON RIGHT THEY'RE WRONG OR I DON'T TOLERATE THAT T HAS TO BE TOLERANCE FOR ALL IDEAS AND THEN YOU ARRIVE AT HOPEFULLY EVENTUALLY COR TRUTHS OR AT LEAST COR TRAJECTORIES AND WHAT DO YOU THINK UM COULD SUPPORT THIS A HOW EARLY SHOULD THIS START I MEAN SHOULD KIDS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOILL BE DISCUSSING UM THE CURRENT LANDSCAPE OF POLITICS AND WHAT THEY SEE FROM A PLACE OF WHAT WE TALK ABOUT SAFE SPACES BUT IS A SAFE SPACE ONE IN WHICH O NO ONE GETS OFFENDED WHERE'S A SAFE SPACE ONE IN WHICH ANY IDEA CAN BE DISCUSSED I THINK THAT'S NEVER REALLY BEEN DEFINED FOR ME THAT'S A REALLY FRAUD ISSUE I MEAN FIRST LET ME GO BACK TO SOMETHING YOU SAID WHICH I WOULD HAVE SAID IT DIFFERENTLY SAY YOU SAID OUR EMOTIONS ARE A FILTER RIGT AND THEY DO ACT LIKE THE FILTER BUT I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK EMOTIONS ARE REALLY FILTER ALIKE SO MUCH AS THEY ARE THE DRIVES THAT ARE UNDERGUARDING THE IMPETUS TO THINK RIGHT THEY'RE PUSHING US TO THINK ABOUT PARTICULAR THINGS AND I THINK IMUN AS A SCIENTIST MY DISTPOSI TION IS ALWAYS THAT TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING IS GOOD AND THE MORE COMPLEXLY THE MORE THOROUGHLY YOU CAN INTERROGATE AN UNDERSTAND SOMETHING THE BETTER SO THERE'S NOTHING I'M AFRAID OF KNOWING IT AND WHAT YOU'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT THEIR IS THE FEAR OF KNOWING WE WHY ARE PEOPLE SO AFRAID TO ENGAGE WITH EACH OTHER BASICALLY BECAUSE IT'S DEEPLY THREATENING TO REVEAL THINGS ABOUT YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE THAT ARE NOT HE A LAND IN US IN US IN A SPACE WHERE WE CAN KIND OF COLLECTIVELY ENGAGE WITH THEM AS LEGITIMATE EXPERIENCE THAT'S THE ISER THE OPPOSIT OF CANCELLING PEOPLE RIGHT ITS THE OPPOSITE OF DISMISSING PEOPLE IT'S ACTUALLY DEVELOPING SPACES OF TRUST WHERE WE CAN ANGAGE WITH IDEAS AND AND AND TAKE THEM FROM OURSELVES RIGHT SO THAT WHERE THEY DON'T THERE NO LONGER PERSONAL VALUE JUDGMENTS THEY BECOME CULTURAL MEANS OR OR OR OR OR MODELS OR SCHEME US THAT WE CAN WE CAN DISSECT TOGETHER THAT WE CAN ENGAGE WITH TOGETHER AND CONSTRUCT UNDERSTANDING AROUND RIGHT AND AND I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND MY OWN POSITION UNLESS I ALSO UNDERSTAND YOURE OPPOSITION TO MY POSITION EVEN IF I STILL DISAGREE WITH YOU I THINK THERE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS GOING ON RIND I'LL TAKE IT BACK TO THE EDUCATION SYSTEM BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I KNOW WHAT MOST ABOUT THERE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS GOING AROND ON RIGHT NOW AROUND REFRAMING THE EXPERIENCE AND OUTCOMES AND AIMS OF SCHOOLING AROUND CIVIC DISCOURSE AND REASONING SO THERE IS JUST A MAJOR REPORT THAT WAS PRODUCED BY THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF EDUCATION AND ANOTHER ACADEMYES A COLLABORATING WITH IT FOR EXAMPLE AAROUND THIS TOPIC AND HELPING US TO MOVE AS A SOCIETY TOWARD A SPACE WHERE WE LEARN TO A KIND OF LAY IDEAS OUT AND DEVELOP SKILLS FOR REASONING AROUND THOSE IDEAS INCLUDING BRINGING ETHICAL EXPERIENTIAL EMOTIONAL CULTURAL VALUES TO BEAR BUT THEN BEING WILLING TO DECONSTRUCT AND ENGAGE WITH THOSE IDEAS WHETHER THEYRE THE ONES THAT ARE COMMENCRED AND FLUID WITH OUR EXPERIENCE OR THAT APPEAR TO BE A CONFLICTING OR DISDISFLUENT WITH OUR EXPERIENCE WE NEED TO DEVELOP US A A SPACES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE ESPECIALLY BUT FOR EVERY ONE IN IN TO ENGAGE WITH THE DECONSTRUCTION OF OUR OWN ASSUMPTIONS LIKE I SAID BEFORE AND TO ENGAGE WITH THE WITH THE DECONSTRUCTION OF OTHERS ASSUMPTIONS AND TO TRY TO RECONCILE THE BUILDING BOX AND THAT'S WHER WE CAN BUILD SOME COMMON GROUND BUT WE CAN ALSO DISAGREE WE BUT WE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND OUR OWN POSITION UNLESS WE APPRECIATE SOME ONE ELSE'S DISAGREEMENT WITH OUR POSITION UNLESS WE CAN ACTUALLY ARTICULATE AND APPRECIATE HOW IT IS THAT PERSONS OPINION IS OPPOSED TO MINE I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND MINE IT'S SUCH A KEYPOINT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I DO READ ALL THE COMMENTS ON PODCASTS ON YOU TO IT TAKES ME SOMETIME BUT I DO IT OR ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS THAT A OFTENTIMES I'LL ET A COMMENTOR CRITICISM THAT MAKES IT VERY CLEAR THAT I WASN'T CLEAR ABOUT SOMETHING OTHER TIMES I'LL GET A COMMENTER CRITICISM THAT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT MY AN THE OTHER PERSON FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE ABOUT SOMETHING BOTH OF WHICH ARE GREAT AND FOR A SCIENTISTIS A DELIGHT AN KEEP ACOMING IM AND OF COURSE ONE PEOPLE AGREE AND IUM THEY AGREE AND MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THEY AGREE FROM A STANCE OF UNDERSTANDING THAT OF COURSE IS ALSO GRATIFYING UM SO IT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND IT'S ONE OT ONE OF THE UPSIDES I THINK OF SOCIAL MEDIA WHICH IS THAT UNLESS PEOPLE BLOCK THEIR COMMENT SECTION AND I DO OCCASIONALLY BLOCK PEOPLE IF THEIRE BEING OFFENSIVE TO OTHER PEOPLE O TALNIS THE NO ERA WHY AM IAN ATING PEOPLE THAT'S NOT INVITING PEOPLE INTO A CONVERSATION ATAT NIT CONSTRUCTIVE I SHOULD HAVE A RULE UM WHICH IS I CALL IT CLASSROOM RULES I' NEVER ANNOUNCED IT BUT I I ALLOW FOR CLASSROOM RULES YOU CAN SWEAR BUT YOU CAN'T SWEAR AT PEOPLE YE I'M THAT'S WHAT I WAS TAUGHT IN GRADUATE SCHOOL I THAT'S WHEREVER YE CAN'T SWEAR AT PEOPLE THOUGHT S ALSO O RRULE AT HOME ALTHOUGH WE TRY NOT TO SWEAR ITS YOU CAN SWEAR BUT TEARING AT PEOPLE IS NOT NON OQ EUM AND THAT YOU KNOW A CERTAIN DECORUM OF YOU KNOW IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO HAVE OPEN DISCOURSE UM SO THAT WORKS FOR ME I THINK THAT IM IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE BEEN IN SCHOOL BUT I WORK AT A SCHOOL AND I THINK THAT HATHE ABILITY TO I'M NOT JUST REINFORCE BUT CHALLENGE ONE'S OWN STANCES WHICH SOMETIMES LEADS TO REINFORCING OUR OWN STANDSEY MAY IT THERABLE MAN THAT'S LEGITIMATE I MEAN I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT IN HIGH SCHOOLS THEY STILL DO DEBATES AND THINGS THAT SORT I MEAN A DO THEY ALLOW THAT I MECOULD YOU UM THROW KIDS IN A CLASS AND SAY LET'S DEBATE I'M SOMETHING REALLY CONTROVERSIAL AND THEN BUT YOU HAVE TO DEBATE IT FROM THE OTHER SIDE I MEAN JUST AS AS A EXPERIMENT OF FORCING THE BRAIN TO IUM TRYD TO BE EFFECTIVE I FORSAKE OF WINNING BUT FROM THE OTHER PERSPECTIVE UM I OR STANCE T SEEMS LIKE A GREAT EXERCISE IF I AV I WERE A IGH SCHOOL TEACHER THAT'S THE FIRST THING I DO O THINK THEM MOST CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC AND THEN I'D PICK I'D ASK PEOPLE TO DIVIDE ALONG THAT TOPIC AND THEN I'D SWOP THEM INTO THE OTHER ONE AND AT THEM ARGUE FROM THE OTHER ONE STANT THO LEARNING TI FOR SHAPE FOR STECTORS THIS VARIS VERY IS VERY AND W E USE FOURTEEN NOUNTS CLOTHES NOW I'M GETTING IT WOULDN'T BE PHYSICAL IT WOULD BE PURELY INTELLECTUALYE I MEANT LET'S THINK IN CAN WE TAKE IT BACK TO THE BRAIN FOR A MOMENT TO THE CONVERSATION THAT WE ARE HAVING EARLIER RIGHT SO WE WERE TALKING ABOW THA IN OUR EXPERIMENTS IN NOW IN WHOLE YOU KNOW WHOLE BODIES OF NARROW SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE WE KNOW THAT THERE IS THIS VERY INTERESTING NAROBIOLOGICAL SORT OF PROCESSING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EMOTIONS IN THE THOUGHTS THAT ARE PART OF THOSE EMOTIONS THAT ARE YOU KNOW THE RESULT OF THOSE EMOTIONS THAT ARE ALSO INCIPTATING THOSE EMOTIONS RIGHT LIKE THE THAT WHOLE PROCESS WHEN IT PERTAINS TO A THE DIRECT ACTIONS OBSERVABLE CHARACTERISTICS BEHAVIORS YOU KNOW A A OF ANOTHER PERSON OR SITUATION THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY DIRECTLY PRETTY MUCH DIRECTLY AN LEARN OR INFER AS COMPARED TO WHEN YOU HAVE TO BRING A WHOLE LOT OF CONCEPTIL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE TO BEAR EXPERIENTIAL KNOWLEDGE A SIMULATION CAPACITY TO BEAR TO BE ABLE TO FULLY APPRECIATE THE NATURE OF A SITUATION AND WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THAT SECOND KIND OF PROCESSING THAT I CALL TRANSCENDENT IS IS AN ESSENCE ABOUT A DISTANCING YOURSELF FROM THE IMMEDIATE PHYSICAL YOU KNOW SITUATION THE OBSERVABLE PERCEIVABLE SITUATION IN A DIRECT SENSE AND INSTEAD CONSTRUCTING A NARRATIVE IN YOUR MIND THAT'S BUILT FROM THAT BUT THAT THEN BRINGS TO BEAR ALL THESE OTHER KINDS OF OF A INFORMATION THAT ELOW YOU TO ELABORATE THIS INTO A NARRATIVE THAT TAKES ON EMOTIONAL MEANING AND IN PSYCHOLOGICAL POWER AS A NARRATIVE IT BECOMES PART OF IDENTITY BELIEF SELECT CONSE AND WE TALKED ABOUT THAT KIND OF THINKING BEING ASSOCIATED WITH THE SO CALLED DEFAULT MODE WHICH IS DEACTIVATED SYSTEMATICALLY AND DECOUPLED FROM ITSELF RIGHT THE DIFFEREN REAGIONS ARENINT TALKING TO EACH OTHER TO EACH OTHER WHEN YOU ARE IN THE WORLD ACTING ITDOING A TASK PAYING ATTENTION INFERRING THE DIRECT THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO NOTICE AROUND YOU YOU KNOW YOUR EMENTAL PLAYING A SOCREGANE THE BALL'S COMING AT YOUR HEAD THAT'S NOT A TIME TO STOP AND MUS ABOUT YOU KNOW TITAL NINE AND GIRLS ACCESS TO SPORTS WRIGHT YOU'RE GOING YOU'RE OING TO TRIP AND FALL OR YOU'RE GOING TO MISS YOU'RE SHOT AT THE GOAL ARE YOU'E GOING O GET HIT WITH THE BALL RIGHT SO WE NEEDS A SORT OF MANAGE THAT SPACE IN ORDER TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS AND I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE IS TO REMBER THAT THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK THAT IS THE SUBSTRATE THAT THAT IS PLAYING OUT YOUR OWN SENSE OF SELF AND INNER CONSCIOUSNESS AND SELF AWARENESS AND IS ALSO THE BASIS ON WHICH WE CONSTRUCT THESE BROADER INFERENTIAL NARRATIVES THAT ARE THE ELABORATIVE STUFF OF STORIES AND BELIEFS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY INCOMPATIBLE THE ACTIVATION OF THOSE SYSTEMS IS FUNDAMENTALLY IN COMPATIBLE WITH A NEEDING TO BE VIGILANT INTO THE IMMEDIATE PHYSICAL OR SOCIAL SITUATION AROUND YOU SO IF YOU FEEL PHYSICALLY EMOTIONALLY CULTURALLY SOCIALLY UNSAFE AND YOU FEEL THAT YOUR YOU NEED TO WATCH YOUR BACK EITHER LITERALLY OR METAPHORICALLY AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THINGS NEURAL BIOLOGICALLY THAT SITUATION IS INCONDUCIVE IT IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY CONJURE AN ALTERNATIVE PERSPECTIVE IN WHICH YOU CONSTRUCT A MEANINGFUL NARRATIVE WITH ALTERNATE ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS WITH ALTERNATE PROSPECTIVE POSSIBLE FUTURE OUTCOMES WITH ALTERNATE VIEWS OF THE HISTORICAL PRECEDENT OR CONTECTS BEING ABLE TO SORT OF MENTALLY TIME TRAVEL INTO THE SPACE OF THOSE IDEAS IS ONLY REALLY POSSIBLE ON PEOPLE FEEL SAFE TO THINK TOGETHER SO IS IT SOUNDS LIKE ITS ANTI CREATIVE YES CREATIVITY IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACTIVATIONS OF THESE NETWORKS YOUNG CAUSABLY SO IN SOME RECENT WORK I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE OF HAVING DINNER LAST YEAR WITH I'M SOMEBODY  I WON'T REVEAL IT IS BUT HE  RUNS A A MAJOR SUS E SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM UM AND HE TOLD ME THAT IN JAPAN A IT'S COMMON FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE TWO OR THREE OR EVEN AS MANY AS SEVEN DIFFERENT SOCIAL MEDEA HANDLES UM AND THAT THEY DO THIS IN ORDER TO EMBODY DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THEMSELVES SAFELY YET SO THESE ARE NOT TROL ACCOUNTS THES ARE NOT THE ACCOUNTS AND BY THE WAY I SEE YOU TROLL ACCOUNTS SAY WHATEVER AND THEN YOU GO TO THEIR ACCOUNTS AT SOME PRIVATE ACCOUNT WHERE THEY HIDE RATHER THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS UM IN ONE ACCOUNT THEY MIGHT BE A BIT AGGRESSIVE MAYBE VEN A BULLY ON LINE DARE I SAY IN ANOTHER ACCOUNT THEY MIGHT BE VERY FAWNING AND UM SHOW UP AS  THE PERSON THAT EVERYONE KNOWS THEM TO BE IN THE REAL WORLD IN ANOTHER ACCOUNT THEY MIGHT BE A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR AND ANOTHER THERE IN ATHLETE AND IT'S FABRICATED IN THE SENSE THAT THE THE THE POST THAT THEY PUT UP OFTEN DON'T ACCURATELY REPRESENT WHO THEY ARE IN THE REAL WORLD YEBUT IT'S ACCURATE IN THE SENSE THAT IT REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF THEIR PERSONA Y THET ER DRIVING THEI REAL WORLD DECISION MAKING AT SOME LEVEL IT'S KIND I LIKE PRETEN PLAY FOR LITTLE KIDS IT'S PERTEND PLAY BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT PRETEND BECAUSE IT'S IN CYRE SPACE UM ALKI'LL JUST GIVE A GO BACK TO RICK REUBEN WHO UM IN ADDITION TO BEING THIS INCREDIBLE MUSIC PRODUCERIS IS A ENORMOUS FAN OF PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING FOR MANY YEARS AND I'VE ASKE HIM YOU KNOW FROM A PERPLEXINS LIKE WHY PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING SAIT THE ATHLETICISM HE SAYS IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT'S REAL BECAUSE EVERYONE AGREES IT'S NOT REAL AND SO THESE ARE A CHARACTETRSTRITE SO YE YOURE AGREEING FOR IT DO NOT BE REAL AND YET IT ALLOWS THESE CHARACTERS TO FULLY EMBODY THESE DIFFERENT PERSONAS AND AND I HAD THE EXPERIENCE A YEARS AGO AS AT CULTZSPRING HARBOR LABORATORY SUMMER CAMP FOR SCIENTISTS WHERE I ATTENDED AND TAUGHT AND I WAS IN A CAB DRIVING OUT TO COLTZPRING HARBOR FROM THE TRAIN STATION SI OSSIT AND I GOT INTO A DISCUSSION WITH THE CAB DRIVER AND HE SAID I CAY YOUR FROM CALIFORNIA E SAID NEW YORK ACCENT I SHALL WON'T TRY IN HIMITA SA YOU FROM CALIFORNIA AND HE SAID YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOVERNOR WHO AT THE TIME WAS SHORTSANEGGER HE SAID HE'S GREAT AND I AND I SAID TELL ME MORE II CAPEN THE LIKE SHORTSENEGGER FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS HE ASSHE SIGNED MY PAGETY CAUSE HE WAS GOVERNOR NOW I WANT TO E OSES AS AND AND HE SAID WELL BECAUSE IF TERRORA SHOW UP IN CALIFORNIA HE'S GON GO OUT THERE WITH A MACHINE GUN I TAKE THEM DOWN SO IN HIS IS HAD HE ALLI O THE TERMINATOR HE'S  THE TERMINATOR YHE'S THE TERMINATOR AND I REALIZED IN THAT MOMENT THIS WAS AT WAS SMART GUY THIS CABDRAVER SNARGA THAT THAT IT WASN'T A LACK OF NARRATIVE DISTANCING NOW HE HAD CONFLATED THE ACTOR WITH THE ROLLER HE PLAYED EAND I REALIZED IN THAT MOMENT THAT THIS WAS NOT A REFLECTION OF HIM BEING UNINTELLIGENT IT WAS A REFLECTION O THE FACT THAT THA THE BRAIN OFTEN COLLAPSE HIS IDENTITIES I OF OTHERS AND MAKES THESE I THINK IT'S JUST A IN A FASHIN THE MON HE IS ARSTIN IT'S AN OFFICIENT WAY TO TOOUT A PARSE THE WORLD NOW WE DECIDE AND TOT THAT'S THAT KIND OF THAT CERDAY NOW WE PUT HIM OVER THERE ON A SHEL FRI YAT SO SO TO RETURN TO THE DISCUSSION THAT THAT WE'RE HAVING I I THINK THAT THE ABILITY TO EMBODY DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF SELF BUT ALSO THE ABILITY TO TRANSIENTLY EMBODY THE PERSONAS OF OTHER PEOPLE AND TO DO THAT IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS FOR REALLY THOROUGH EXPLORATION OF IDEA SPACE N I FEEL IKE CAN ONLY BE A GOOD THING PROVIDED IT DOESN'T GET PHYSICALLY VIOLENT OR SOMETHING UM BUT THAT TO ME SEEMS LIKE THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW WHICH IS THAT AM PEOPLE ARE SYLOING OFF INTO THEIR CAMPS WERE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE AND SPECIFIC IDEAS ARE ACCEPTED AND OTHERS ARE NOT AMIN UT'S IT'S IT'S SO INTERESTING AND PERPLEXING AND DISTURBING TO ME THAT THE WAY THAT'S CERTAIN THINGS THAT HAVE NO THING TO DO WITH POLITICS GET LUMPED WITH ONE GROUP OR THE OTHER YOU KNOW THAT UM IT'S SO CRAZY TO ME ON THE ONE HAND AND UM AND YET I I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING SEEMS TO ME THE ROUT OUT OF ALL THIS I REALLY MEAN THAT I FEEL LIKE YOU THE EDUCATION SYSTEM STARTING YOUNG AND GETTING PEOPLE EMOTIONALLY ENGAGED LEARNING WHAT THEY LIKE WHAT THEY DON'T LIKE BUT THEN ALSO TEACHING THEM ABOUT THEIR EMOTIONAL SYSTEMS AND HOW IT HELPS TOM PARTS THE WORLD IS REALLY THE SOLUTION SO THAT WHEN WE'RE UPSET WE CAN AND REALIZING YET I'M UPSET IT MAKE SENSE WHY I'M UPSET LETME EXPLORE IT FROM THE OTHER SIDICS ITIT ALSO MAKE SENSE WHIKE THE'RE UPSET AND THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT HUMANS HAVE DONE SOMEWHAT THROUGHOUT HISTORY NEVER PERFECTLY WELL BUT IT SEEMS LIKE IT OUGHT TO BE POSSIBLE I MEAN THE FOREBRAIN IS THERE FOR REASON SO COULD YOU UM IN IN WANTING TO GO BACK TO LOBIT OF THE BIOLOGY IN THE RESEARCH WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN IN TERMS OF CROSS CULTURAL CONSISTENCY YEABOUT THE ROLE OF EMOTIONS IN IT IN OUR ABILITY TO PARSE AND LEARN AND U BECAUSE IVAS SEY WERE NOT CONSOLVED THESE PROMISE TO DAY BUT ALTHOUGH I THINK YOU'VE POINT SHINE LIGHT ON SOME SOME POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS WHAT DO WE KNOW FOR SURE ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS IN THEIR CAPACITY TO DO WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING TO TO REALLY UM LEARN DIFFERENTLY AIT WORKED IN THE CLASSROOM WHERE YOU ERE TEACHING BUT HOW COULD EACH IN EVERY ONE OF US DO THIS I MEAN HOW WOULD WE APPROACH TO IM I GUS SO ONE TO TAKE US TO THE PRACTICAL YUM WHAT CAN WE DO WHEN WE READ A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE WHAT CAN WE DO WHEN WE WERE ON SOCIAL MEDIO WHAT CAN WE DO U WHEN OUR KID IS LIKE REFUSING TO DO SOMETHING UM BECAUSE THEY'D SIMPLY DON'T LIKE IT OR OR THAT THE TEACHER THEY DON'T LIKE THE TEACHER ARE ARE THERE PATHS THROUGH THAT THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED OR THAT YOU CAN SENSE WORK I CAN GET FUNNY EXAMPLES MY AN KETS WON THA ADN'T LIKE THINGSTHAT SCOL RIGHT I IT IS ISN'T YOU LICE THING O WHAT YOU YEL AN WHAT SOOLS DO YOU USE AN MISENCE TO NOT E YET SO SO MY MY SON AND WHEN HE WASN'T THIR GRATE HE WAS HE WAS VERY UPSET ABOUT THE BEHAVIOUR CHART THAT HIS TEACHER HAD AT SCHOOL AND SO HE HAD A YE HAD A BEHAVIOUR SHIRE THEYHAD A BEHAVIOUR CHIRE TO BACK THE ROOM THE THE PRINCIPALE DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS BUT THAT TEACHERWAS THERE FOR A YEARN OOK SO THERE'S HIS BEHAVIOUR CHARD AND YOU HAVE GREEN YOU START ON GREEN WITH YOUR ITTLE CLIB AND THEN THERE'S YELLOW AND THEN THERE'S RED WHICH IS LIKE CALL YOUR PARENTS WIC I NEVER UNDERSOOD WHY THEY DON'T  CALL YOUR PARENTS ON THE GREEN BUT AT ANYWAY RIGHT SO YOU KNOW YOU START ON THE GREEN AND I GET YOUD GET DOWN TO THE YELLOW EN THEY GET ROUND THE RED AND YOU KNOW THERE'S TED'S LITTLE FRIEND IS ALWAYS GETTING ON THE RAD BY NINE AAMS LIKE H WE JUST GET IT OVER WITH YOU AND AND HE TRIED TO TALK WITH HIS TEACHER ABOUT WHY THIS BEHAVIOUR CHART MADE HIM SO UN COMFORTABLE BECAUSE AND SHE COULDN'T SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HIS PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE SHE KEPT SAYING BUT YOU'RE ALWAYS ON GREEN YOU'RE ALWAYS DOING WHAT YOUR SUPOSE TO BE DOING AND YOUR RESPECTFUL AN YOU'R WELL BEHAVE SO WISE AT A PROBLEM AND WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO SAY WAS THAT SOMEHOW IT JUST MADE HIM UNCOMFORTABLE TO HAVE THAT THERE SO HE WAS CONSTLY BOTHERING ME WITH THIS I FINALLY TOLD HIM I WAS TRYING TO WORK ONE DAY AND HE WAS HOME FROM SCHOOL CAUSE I WOULD LET HIM WORK FROM HOME SOME DAYS BECAUSE WE NEEDED TO TO KIND OF BUFFERA ALL BIT AND A YOU KNOW HE'D BRING ALL IS WORK OME WHEN YOU'D DOIN HIMSELF I'D BE WORKING HE'D BE WORKING RIGHT IT'S FINE HE HAD ALL KINDS OF PROJECTS GOING ON YOU KNOW AND THIS IS A KIT WHO OF ISMOLE SIZES TER IS A KIT WHO WENT TO FIRST GRADE AND ABOUT TWO WEEKS IN T A FIRST GRADE GOOD FIRST GREATE CLASS HE HE WAS CRYING ON A SUNDAY NIGHT TO ME LIKE I I GO TO SCHOOL OT O GA SCHOL MY WALL WAS WE YOU NOW WHAT'S WRONG AS COME THINKING HE'S GETTING BULLIYS IN HIS RONG MUS LIKE IO FINALLY LOOKS TO MEE GOES I HAVE SO MUCH WORK TO DO HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO GET MY WORK DON IF I'M SITTING IN SCHOOL ALL DAY I CANARLY  CAN REA  CAN YOU WRELITE BECAUSE YOU'RE ACTUALLY A MODE OF EIT IS RIGT WED TAKE KIDS MOTIVATIONS AND THE THINGS THEY'RE INTERESTED IN AND WE SIDE LINE THEM AND TRY TO STRUCTURE THE MENISONE SO BACK TO THE R LEGOS JA TIU THATS YOWOH HE WAS THAT HE WAS WAYING TO BUILDING ARMOR AT THAT TIME HE WOULD YO I KNOW WE PRIVE TERRIBLE PARENT AN WE GAIM SOME SAFETY GLASSES AND WE TAUGHT HIM HOW TO USE AN WE EXPLAINED HOW MEDALS SHARP WHEN WE GAVE HIM SOME SHO THATI'LL SUPERCOOL AND SOME TIN SNAPS AND HE MADE A WHOLE SIT OF ARMOR IN THE BACK YARD AT YOU KNOW SECOND RIT AND ANYWAY IT TOOK A MONTHS AND MONT SOMMIN CHAIN MAIL THE WHOLE BET HE  S SUPERMINES NO ANYWAY A HE MADE OUR PLINTHE ME DID ALL KINDS OF THINGS A BUT SO HERE'S THIS KID AND HE'S BUGGING ME ABOUT HIS TEACHER IN THIS BEHAVEOR TURN I SAID TED GO READ A LETTER TO YOUR TEACHER ID BOSIES THAT MUCH YOU GO RIT A LETTER ABOUT WYAT BOTHERSHIP I BECAUSE IN DOING SO HE'S FIRST OF ALL HELPING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM SECONDLY HE WAS HE WAS FORMULATING HIS UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THIS BEHAVIOR CHART IS AND WHY SPECIFICALLY IT BOTHERS HIM AND IN SO DOING AND HELPS HIM NOT BE SO BOTHERED BY IT RIGHT SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING YOU COULD DO RITE SO HE WROTE THIS LETTER TO HIS TEACHER WHICH AND THAT BEING PUBLISHED IN THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE ENTEERING AND TATS HOOK HOW PEOPLE LEARNED VOLIM TOO BECAUSE I WAS ON THE COMMITTEE OF PEOPLE THAT WROTE ID AND WE NEEDED AN EXAMPLE OF KID'S MAKING SENSE OUT OF MOTIVATIONAL THINGS AND ACTUALLY TOOK HIS NAME AND A TISHS THEN OFTEN PUT THE LETTER IN THE BOOK EBASICALLY IS A LITTLE KID SAYNG LISTON TEACHER WHEN YOU PUT UP THIS BEHAVE IYOUR CHART HE CALLED A BAD BEHAVIOR CHART WHICH IT WASN'T IT WAS JUST A BEHAV OR CHARP BUT HE INTERPRETS IT AS BAD BEHAVE TRIC WHEN HE PUT THAT UP IT'S AS IF YOU'RE YOU'RE DARING ME TO DO SOMETHING BAD YOU'RE YOU'RE BASICALLY HE DOESN'T SAY LECAUSE HE SAYS YOU'RE BASICALLY MAKING ME UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE YOU ARE LAYING OUT UP IKE A PERSPECTIVE ON ME A POSSIBILITY SPACE FOR ME THAT YOU'RE NOW BRINGING IN TO THE CONVERSATION THAT I COULD BE LIKE THAT AND LET'S SEE IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE OUGHT NOT TO DAY O WAS STILL ON GREATNIGHT AND SO WHERE IS THIS O IT GOES BACK TO THE IDEA THAT KIDS ARE AND ALL OF US ARE INTERPRETING THE INTERACTIONS AND THE STRUCTURES AROUND US NOT NLY FOR WHAT THEY ARE BUT FOR WHAT THEY REPRESENT AS SOMEBODY ELSE'S INTERPRETATION OF WHAT WE ARE OR ARE NOT CAPABLE OF AND HE SAW THAT BEHAVIOR CHART AS A MARKER THAT HIS TEACHER ASSUMED THAT ALL KIDS IN THAT CLASS ARE CAPABLE OF BEING BADLY BEHAVED AND THAT THEIR MAY NAME OF BEING IN SCHOOL IS TO BE WELL BEHAVED RIGHT AND SO HE WRITES ALL ABOUT SAYING SAYING DEAR TEACHER EVERY DAY I COME TO SCHOOL EVERY SINGLE DAY AND EVERY SINGLE DAY IS NEW THAT'S WHATHE SAYS AND I COULD LEARN SOMETHING NEW EXCEPT THEN I SEE DATATAT THE BAD BEHAVIOR CHARP RIGHT HE SAYING SCHOOL IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT LEARNING AND AND US ENGAGING AND YOU'RE MAKING IT ABOUT SOMETHING SO LOW LEVEL AND BASIC AS ARE YOU GOING TO BEHAVE YOURSELF TO DAY WE'RE WE ARE INSULTING HIM BY THE WAY WE FRAME THE CONTEXT SO TAKE IT BACK TO THE BIGGER ISSUES OF CIVIC DISCOURSE ANDALL THESE THINGS I THINK SO MUCH OF THE WAY THAT WE'RE ORGANIZING ARE LIVES OUR SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS ARE COMMUNITY ARE CIVIC STRUCTURES RIGHT NOW IS I MIRRORING THAT TEACHERS BEHAVIOR CHART RAD SHE TAKE THE CHART NOW I DON'T NO I DON'T THINK SO AND AND WHATS AND I ASK BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE THAT IT MATTERS I THINK WHAT PROBABLY MATTERS IS THAT HE HAD THE CHANCE TO VOICE HE VOICES HIS UNDERSTANDAND IS UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHART YE THAT'S RIGHT AND NOW YOU KNOW ANYBODY CAN READ HIS UNDERSTANDING CHART JUST  UTI AND LIKE IN THE MOST WIDELY REDTAXTS LOOK ON LEARNING RIGHT I AND MOT IFVISION I MEAN THE POIT TI COUPLE POINT'S FIRST IS THAT WE'RE STRUCTURING THE WAY WE STRUCTURE IRE ENVIRONMENT CAN UNWITTINGLY IMPOSE ARE MENTAL MODELS OF OTHER PEOPLE'S POSSIBILITY'SPACES ON TO THEM AND PEOPLE FIND THAT INHERENTLY ABARRENT RIGHT SO THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE DOING THAT IN MANY CONTECTS NOT SIMPLY IN SCHOOLS AM AND THEN THE SECOND THING IS FROM THE KENTS PERSPECTIVE DECONSTRUCTING EXACTLY WHY AND IT'S SOMETHING BOTHERS YOU BY UNDERSTANDING HOW IT IS THAT YOU ARE INTERPRETING THAT THING THEN OPENS YOU UP TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THOSE SPACES IN A NEW WAY AND TO ENGAGE IN THE MANSO IF WE TAKE THE CONVERSATION BACK TO THE IDEA OF CIVIC DISCOURSE OF CIVIC REASONING OF ENGAGING WITH WITH ANY IDEA RIGHT THERE ARE IDEAS THAT ARE DEEPLY PROBLEMATIC THERE ARE IDEAS THAT ARE DEEPLY HURTFUL THAT HAVE LONG HISTORIES OF TRAMA ASSOCIATED WITH THEM OF LONG HISTORIES OF POWER DYNAMICS A AND OPPRESSION ASSOCIATED WITH THEM THE WAY IN WHICH I THINK WE DECONSTRUCT THOSE IDEAS IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL TO HOW THOSE IDEAS LIVE ON IMPLICITLY IN OUR SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS IN OUR SOCIETY IF WE CANCEL THEM IF WE NEGATE THEM AND IPRETEND THEY DON'T EXIST ALL WERE DOING IS BURYING THEM IN A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN'T BE DECONSTRUCTED AND ONLY BY ACTUALLY TAKING THEM APART AND APPRECIATING THE PAIN THE THE THE RELATIONSHIP STRUCTURES THE LIMITATIONS THE RESOURCE APPLICATIONS THE INEQUITIES THAT ARE IMPLICIT IN THOSE CONCEPTS ONLY BY DECONSTRUCTING AND DEEPLY UNDERSTANDING THOSE CAN WE WE BUILD THEM IN A DIFFERENT WAY SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND WE HAVE A SPACE CREATED FOR OURSELVES RIGHT NOW IN SOCIETY THAT IS DEEPLY UNSAFE FOR MANY PEOPLE AND WHEN YOU ARE IN AN UNSAFE SPACE YOU ARE NOT IN A SPACE THAT IS CONDUCIVE TO CONSTRUCTING AND DECONSTRUCTING MEANING USING THOSE DEFAULTOD SYSTEMS AND OTHER SYSTEM SYS TO BE CRAST D BOUT THE BRAIN RIGHT IN KIND OF OVERSYBLIFIIT THAT ARE A THE SUBSTRATE OF AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SELF OF POSSIBILITYE SPACES OF THICS OF DEEP A MORAL AND ETHICAL EMOTIONS SO ON THE ONE HAND WE HAVE A SPACE THAT IS DEEPLY UNSAFE FOR INDIVIDUALS TO THINK TOGETHER AND GENUINELY SO THERE ARE REAL IMPLICATIONS FOR PEOPLE TO REVEAL CERTAIN KINDS OF IDENTITIES TO ENGAGE WITH CERTAIN KINDS OF IDEAS IN CULTURALLY A CULTURALLY A FORMULATED SPACES RIGHT THAT WE'VE CONSTRUCTED TOGETHER AND THE IRONY IS THAT WE CAN ONLY FIX THAT AND CREATE A DIFFERENT WAY OF INTERACTING WITH ONE ANOTHER BY ACTUALLY BOLDLY GOING IN THERE TOGETHER SO IT'S A VERY NUANTS LINE WHERE WE NEED TO DEVELOP SKILLS IN THIS IS WHERE I THINK AND AND MANY PEOPLE THINK NOW THAT SCHOOLS SHOULD BE FOCUSED ACROSS DISCIPLINARY DOMANDS WHETHER ITS MAT SCIENCE SOCIAL STUDIES ISTERY ART THE ARTS RIGHT SPORTS SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON HELPING YOUNG PEOPLE AND TEACHERS DEVELOP CAPACITIES AND DISPOSITIONS FOR DECONSTRUCTING AND CONSTRUCTING AGAIN SAFE A SAFE CULTURAL SPACES TO THINK TOGETHER ABOUT YOU KNOW INTERPRETATIONS ABOUT NARRATIVES ABOUT STORIES ABOUT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT IDEAS BECAUSE AS WE ENGAGE IN THOSE THOUGHTS TOGETHER WE CALL THAT CIVIC DISCOURSE RIGHT WE LEARN KIND OF RULES FOR NOT TRIGGERING AND SENSIBILITIES FOR NOT ENDANGERING ANOTHER PERSONS ABILITY TO ENGAGE ON EQUAL FOOTING WITH US BECAUSE IF WE TRIGGER THOSE UNSAFE RIGHT DANGEROUS PLACES FOR PEOPLE THEY CAN'T NOR A BIOLOGICALLY THEN ENGAGE WITH US DEEPLY AROUND SHARING THEIR PERSPECTIVE AND DECONSTRUCTING OURS TOGETHER TO BUILD SOMETHING WHERE WE HAVE A SHAREED UNDERSTANDING IN THE MIDDLE WE HAVE TO TRUST ONE ANOTHER AND TRUST TRUSTING ONE ANOTHER REALLY MEANS WE HAVE TO HAVE A SPACE ESTABLISHED IN WHICH WE CAN FEEL SAFE TO DECONSTRUCT OUR OWN BELIEFS AND TO ALLOW OTHERS TO DO THE SAME AND TO ASSURE THEM THAT WE CAN ENGAGE WITH THOSE BELIEFS NO MATTER WHAT THEY ARE AND THEN ACTUALLY EXTERIORIZE THEM AND EVALUATE THEM TOGETHER AND THINK ABOUT THEM AROUND COUR VALUES WE PROBABLY BOTH HOLD LIKE WELL BEING LIKE SUSTAINABILITY OF SOCIETY AND OF CULTURES AND OF GROUPS RIGHT THESE THINGS ARE CORS EVERYONE WANTS TO BE WHILE EVERY ONE WANTS TO HAVE A SUSTAINABLE LIFE AND A LIFE FEATURE AND OF CULTURAL SET OF VALUES AND SO WHEN WE ALL APPRECIATE THAT WERE BRINGING THOSE THINGS THE TABLE BUT THEN OR SYSTEMATIC ABOUT CONSTRUCTING A SPACE FOR CIVIC DISCOURSE IN WHICH WE ARE SUPPORTING ONE ANOTHER IN DECONSTRUCTING OUR OWN BELIEFS RATHER THAN EACH OTHERS BELIEFS RIGHT THEN WE ARE AT A SPACE WHERE WE CONSTART TO CONSTRUCT SOME KIND OF UNDERSTANDING SOME KIND OF NEW WANTS MORE UM A ADAPTIVE MORE PROSOCIAL AND TRUE SENSE WAY OF ENGAGING WITH ONE ANOTHER WOITD NOT NECESSARILY WAY OF AGREEING WITH ONE ANOTHER BUT WAY OF ENGAGING AND CONSTRUCTING AND DECONSTRUCTING MEANING TOGETHER SO THAT WE CAN BE ADAPTED SO THAT WE CAN BUILD A SOCIETY WHERE EVERYONE CAN FLOURISH SO THAT WE CAN BUILD A SOCIETY WHERE EVERYONE CAN BELONG AND CAN A CAN ACTUALLY HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED I WOULD ARGUE AS LONG AS FREE SPEECH IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR EVERYBODY YET THAT NOBBODY KNOBOT YET'S THAT'S RIGHT THE NOBODY'S SAY NOBODY SAY  THAT THERE'S AN ILLUSION OF SAFETY AROUND THE IDEA THAT U PEOPLE WHO UM WHO HAVE VOICE ARE GOING TO GET WHAT THEY WANT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE ALLOWED TO TALK AND OTHER PEOPLE AREN'T YEM I THINK YOU SAID IT PRIVILY WHEN YE SAID THAT ANY TIME IDEAS GET BURIED THERE'S NOWAY THEY CAN BE SOLVD YE WE KNOW THIS FROM THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AIRESES ATD A REALIZE WITHIN SOCIAL SCIENCE AND BYOLOGICAL SCIENCITOR DEEPLY TROUBLING YE M YOU KNOW I CAN THINK OF EXPERIMENTS THAT WERE DONE IN THE REALM OF NURO SURGERY ON HUMANS IN THE NINETEEN SIXTY A PEOPLE STIMULATING DIFFERENT BRAIN AREAS AND SEEING RAGE OR SEEING VERY POLITICALLY CONTROVERSIAL IDEAS EMERGED FROM THE PERSON'S MOUTH IN REAL TIME  FUNCTION OF STIMULATING THAT BRAIN AREA AND THEN YOU SAY WELL DID THEY REALLY BELIEVE THAT AND THEY JUST NEVER WERE SAYING IT AND THE PERSON DOESN'T EVEN RECALL THAT HAPPENING DURING THE SURGERY OR MEN THIS IDEA THAT YOUNG HAD THAT WE HAVE ALL THINGS INSIDE OF US YET I THINK CAN BE SEEN AS A VERY DANGEROUS NOTION AND TERRITORY THAT WE HAVE ALL THESE SHADOWS BUT THE AT THE I'M ALSO AN OPTIMIST AND I FEEL THAT THE THE OPTIMISTIC VIEW OF IT IS THAT BY KNOWING THAT WE HAVE ALL THINGS INSIDE OF US POTENTIALLY THAT IMD BY ANIT AND BY EMBRACING THAT FACT THAT WE CAN MANAGE THAT NOT TO STEAL WHAT YOU JUST SAID WE CAN MANAGE THAT AND THAT WE CAN FUNCTION SO MUCH BETTER WHEN WE SEE SOMETHING IN THE WORLD THAT WE THINK THAT'S NOT ME I'M NOT THAT AND I HATE THAT WHEN IF WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT ALSO LIVES INSIDE OF US BUT THAT WE JUST DON'T REALIZE IT AND I REALIZE SOME PEOPLE HEAR THIS INGO THAT'S NOT TRUE YOU KNOW I HAVE MY STANCES AND I DISAGREE WITH OTHER THINGS I WOULD SAY ABSOLUTELY YES BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE PERSON STANDS IN ANOTHER PERSON STANCS IS COULD BE PURELY DEVELOPMENT A WIRING IT COULD BE AM IT COULD BE DIFFERENCE OF HAVING READ DIFFERENT CHILDHOOD BOOKS AND AN ORIENTED TOWARDS ONE BOOK VERSES ANOTHER I'M AN I DON'T I THINK THAT WE ARE VERY SIMILAR AT THE LEVEL OF COR WIRING AND CORE ALGARITMS THAT WE RUN BUT SOMEHOW THESE DAYS  WE HAVE THE PERCEPTION THAT WEV DIVERGE SO MUCH I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT'S REALLY MISSING IS WHAT YOUR DESCRIBING IS IS A PLACE WHERE ANY IN ALL IDEAS CAN BE EXPLORED FREELY NOT TO ESTABLISH CONSENSIS AN LEVALIITY HAD CERTAIN KINDS OF IDEAS RUT TOO ACTUALLY EXTERIORIZE THAT I AND DE CONSTRUCT THEM FOR WHAT THEY ACTUALLY ARE ABSOLUTELY AM HANK YOU FOR WORKING THROUGH THAT THAT PASE CAUSE IS IT'S A TRICKY ONE I AN WARY IT'S VERY FROT YET IT'S IT'S VERY FRAUGT U BUT SO SO VERY IMPORTANT I HAVE A QUESTION THAT'S VERY BASIC UM BUT I'VE NEVER GOTTEN A GOOD ANSWER ON UM I WAS RAISED THINKING THAT MARINERONS WERE A REAL THING TI THE THAT THERER THESE NURONS THAT EXISTS IN THE IN THE BRAINS OF US AN OTHER OLD WORLD PRIMATES UM LIKE MACAC MONKEYS UM BUT ESPECIALLY IN HUMANS THATHE SO CALLED MARINRONS THAT ARE ACTIVE ADED WHEN WE SEE SOMEBODY EXPERIENCE SOMETHING AND IT EVOKES THE SORT OF EMPATHIC UNDERSTANDING UM IN US I'VE ALSO SEEN SOME REVIEWS WRITTEN RECENTLY IN SOME POPULAR PRESS SAYING THAT A MIRINERONS ARE PERHAPS NOT PLAYING THAT THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT WE THOUGHT THEY WERE IUM WHAT'S THE STORY ON MARINRONS UM AND I WERE NOT GOING AFTER ANYBODY'S WORK IN PARTICULAR I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHETHER NOT THERE'S REAL VALIDITY TO THI NOTION OF MIRINERANS I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW ABOUT IT AND THE WAY THAT IM I THINK ABOUT IT SO I MEAN I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR NOW THAT THERE ARE NO SUCH THINGS AS MIRONERANS LIKE SOME SPECIAL KIND OF CELL TYPE THAT'S IN THE BRAIN THE THE THEY'VE NOT BEEN FOUND THEY WERE PREDICTED BUT THEY WERE NOT FOUND UM BUT SOMETHING ELSE WAS ALSO PREDICTED BACK IN THE LATE NINETEEN EIGHTYS IM I BY ANTONIA DE MASIO IM WHERE HE TALKED ABOUT THE BRAIN I IN TERMS BEING ORGANIZED INTERMS OF WHAT HE CALLED CONVERGENT AND DIVERGENT ZONES SO HE TALKED ABOUT IM THE BRAIN BEING ORGANIZED AS NATWORKS CONVERGING AND THEN DIVERGING AGAIN BACK OUT SO YOU HAVE PLACES WHERE PROCESSING IS KIND OF COMING TOGETHER AND THEN THEN THEN WHAT HAPPENS IN THERE THEN DETERMINES HOW THINGS GET SPREAD BACK OUT AND YOU'VE GOT THESE SORT OF LOOPS HAPPENING IN THE BRAIN AND AND HIS HIS THINKING ON THAT WAS VERY MUCH AM COMMENSORATE WITH OTHERS THINKING ABOUT THE NOTION OF A OF GOLD DIRECTED ACTION AND PERCEPTION SO IF YOU THINK BACK TO DEVELOPMENTAL SCHOLARS WH AD NEW NOTHING ABOUT THE BRAIN VERY MUCH LIKE JAN PIEGE RITE BACK IN EARLY A A TWENTY TWENTITHE CENTRY AM WHERE HE WAS OBSERVING YOUNG CHILDREN AND NOTICING THAT THEY WERE INTERACTING WITH THE WORLD AND THEY EXPECTED CERTAIN THINGS AND THEY WERE HE THOUGHT IMPOSING THEORIES OR SCHEMAS ON TO THE WORLD AND THEN AND THEN ACCOMMODATING WAS THE WORD HE USED A THE WORLD WITH THEIR ACTIONS WHAT IT DIDN'T ACT THE WAY THEY EXPECTED AND THEN ASSIMILATING GHAT BACK RIGHT TO CHANGE WHAT THEY EXPECTED NEXT TIME SO THAT HE HAD THIS MODEL THAT HE BUILT FROM FROM SYSTEMATICALLY OBSERVING CHILDREN A THRE IN PARTICULAR RIGHT AM WHERE HE WHAT HE REALIZES THAT KIDS ARE NOT JUST FLAILING AROUND SORT OF DISCOVERING THINGS HAF HAZARDLY THEY'RE IMPOSING A CERTAIN LOGIC ON TO THE WORLD AND THEN THEY'RE SYSTEMATICALLY TESTING THAT LOGIC TO THEIR HYPOTHESIS ERY BASICALLY YES RIGHT THEY THEYRE EXPECTING THINGS AND THEN WHEN THE WORLD DOES WHAT THEY WANT THAT REENFORCES AND WHEN IT DOES SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT SURPRISING AND THEN THEY HAVE TO ACCOMMODATE AND MAKE SENSAND THEN THEY HAVE TO EXPECT DIFFRENTLY IN THE FUURE SO WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH MURINARS I THINK WHEN YOU BRING THESE DIFFERENT IDEAS TOGETHER THAT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONAL IDEAS AND THEN THE NURBIOLOGICAL IDEAS AM WHAT WE BASICALLY HAVE AND II WROTE ABOUT THIS LITTLE BIT IN LIKE TI THINK TWO THOUSANT AIT IVE A PAPER COLLSOMTHING LIKE THE SMOKE AROUND MURNURANS AND I FORGET THE SECONDHAVE THET TITLE BUT HAS THE WORD GOLDS AND TAND A AND DIRECTED ACTIONS AND THINK RIHT AM THE IDEA I THINK IS IS IT'S NOT THAT THERE ARE SPECIAL NURANTS THEYRE FIR NG WHEN WE SEE ANOTHER PERSON DO THE THING WRITE THAT BUT THAT WE ARE ECOSPECT TO THE NOTION OF US IMPOSING OUR EXPECTATIONS ON TO THE WORLD YOU HAVE TO SHARE AND UNDERSTANDIN TUITIVELY THE GOAL OF THE OTHER ONE'S ACTION IN ORDER TO ACTIVATE THESE MIRROR REGENS RIGHT AM I WE'RE AND WHAT ARE THOSE MIRROR REGIENS THEY ARE BASICALLY REGONS THAT ARE DEEPLY INTERCONNECTED WITH EACH OTHER RIGHT THEY'RE THOROUGHLY INTERCONNECTED WITH EACH OTHER INTREPS OF WHITE MATTER FIBR TRACTS AND THEY ARE REGENS INVOLVED IN AM ACTION A A PLANNING YOU KNOW GOAL ORANTED ACTIONS AND PERCEIVING THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE ACTIONS SO IT'S A KIND OF A LOOP BETWEEN ACTING AND PERCEIVING AND ACTING AND PERCEIVING AND AND I ARGUED AT THE TIME BRIGHT THAT GOALS ARE EMERGENT LIKE HIGH LEVEL GOALS ARE EMERGENT FROM THE DYNAMIC FEED BACK LOOPS OF ACTING AND PERCEIVING RIGHTS I WAS REALLY TAKING A VERY PIAGETTI IN VIEW BUT IMPOSING THAT ON THE NURSA SO I THINK YOU TAKE WHAT I'M SAYING TOGETHER WITH LIKE A PIAGETTIAN CONSTRUCTIVEST VIEW THE'RE MANY OTHER CONSTRUCTIVES NARRAL SCIENTIVESAL A CONSTRUCTIVE PSYCHOLOJUST ALSO AND AND THEN ALSO THE NURLD DATA WHAT WE SEE IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THESE SPECIAL NURRANTS BILT INTO OUR HEAD WHAT WE HAVE IS A NATURAL PROCLIVITY NOT NON KNOW WHERE THAT COMES FROM RIGHT BUT WE HAVE A NATURAL PROCLIVITY TO TRY TO APPRECIATE ANOTHER PERSONS ACTIONS FEELINGS EXPERIENCES BY LEVERAGING OUR OWN SIMILAR ACTIONS FEELINGS EXPERIENCES AND SO WHEN WE CAN SHARE GOALS OR EXPERIENCES THAT BECOMES MORE FASCILE RIGHT AND THAT'S BEEN TION OVER AND OVER IN THESE MIRROR TYPE PAPER IS RIGHT AND WHEN YOU A DISTANCE YOURSELF FROM THOSE GOALS AND ACTIONS OR DON'T HAVE AN INTUITIVE SENSE OF THEM THEN YOU DON'T GET THESE MIRRORING ACTIVATIONS YOU DON'T GET THESE KIND OF RAMPED UP A A SHARING OF OF OF OF GOALS  OR OF OF EXPERIENCE SO I THINK IT REALLY COMES BACK TO THE WAY THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS WIRED TO BE INHERENTLY SOCIAL WE ARE CULTURAL LEARNERS WE ARE SITUATED IN SOCIAL SPACES FROM THE MOMENT WERE CONCEIVED AND CERTAINLY FROM THE MOMENT WERE BORN AND THAT SOCIAL SPACE OBSERVING OTHERS IN ERACTING WITH OTHERS COREGULATING EACH OTHER'S PHYSIOLOGY EACH OTHER'S ATTENTION EACH OTHERS A EMOTION RIGHT AS WE DO THOSE THINGS WE ACCOMMODATE TO EACH OTHER AND WE WIRE OURSELVES TO EXPECT CERTAIN KINDS OF FEELINGS AND THEN TO RECOGNIZE THOSE SAME THINGS AND OTHER PEOPLE AND SO AS WE SHARE CONSTRUCTED EXPERIENCE TOGETHER WE START TO APPRECIATE THE SAMENESS RIGHT THAT THE THE THE PARALLELS BETWEEN OTHER PEOPLES AND OUR OWN EMOTIONS THOUGHTS GOALS AND AND WE CAN ALSO A DEHUMANIZE THEM YOU DON'T MAKE THE OTHER THE OTHER PERSON NOT SHARE OR THOUGHTS EMOTIONS GOALS AND THEN WE ARE CAPABLE OF ALL KINDS OF ARABLE THINGS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE RIGHT AWERYORD WHERE YOU'E ACTUALLY DISTANCED YOURSELF SO WHAT'S THIS SGOOP ON MIRINERANS I DON'T THINK MIROR NURONS EXIST I THINK THAT'S THE CONSENSES BUT ORE PROPENSITY TO ENGAGE WITH OTHER PEAPLE BY SIMULATING ON THE SUBSTRACT OF OUR OWN SELF AND THEN INFERRING THE GOALS AND THE FEELINGS AND THE OUTCOMES AND THE EXPERIENCES OF THOSE EXPERIENCES THAT WE'D SIMULATED THAT'S WHAT IS VERY ESSENTIAL TO BEING A HUMAN BUT KEEPING IN MIND THAT THERE'S ALSO THIS LAYER OF LEARNED LIVED CULTURAL DEVELOPED EXPECTATIONS WE IMPOSE ON TO THE WORLD AND WE NOT FILTER BUT WE A WE STEER OUR ATTENTION WE STEER OUR PERCEPTION TO ACCOMMODATE TO ALINE WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS SO IT'S NEVER JUST THE REALITY OF WHAT THE PERSON EXPERIENCED O WHAT HAPPENED IT'S ALWAYS OUR PERCEPTION OF THAT REALITY AS WE EXPECTED IT TO HAPPEN SO THERE'S THIS VERY DYNAMIC CULTURAL CO CONSTRUCTION HAPPENING THAT IS I'M THAT IS MESSY THAT IS ITTERATIVE THAT YOU CAN LEARN TO DO INDIFFERENT WAYS IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS  AND AND THAT'S KIND OF HOW I UNDERSTAND THIS NOTION OF MIRRORING BEFORE WE CONCLUDE I DO WANT TO ANSWER YOUR SON'S QUESTION O SO DON'T BE SO SO PRIOR TO RECORDING UM THERE WAS A A TEX MESSAGE THAT CAME AND WE DON'T VA READ IT VERBADUM UT THE TE MESSAGE UM A MERY ELLEN'S SON I IS A LATEEN AGE YEARS AND HE'S BEEN DOING A DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSE RECOLD SHOWERS OWN ON A DAILY BASIS AND REPORTED THAT HE'S NOT YET HE HASN'T HAD ANY COLDS SINCE STARTINGNESS THIS IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY COMMON EXPERIENCE BECAUSE THE PULSE IN A DRENNALIN THAT IS INEVITABLE WITH A UNCOMFORTABLY COLD BUT SAFE YNO  ON'T SHAT OF THAT IN THE MORNING DOEST E HULLMUCH OF EXERCISES TO GET WARM AN THE JUMPSON A FREE COCHOR AMAZE HIM A' THAT SPIKE OF A GENTLEMEN WE KNOW AS IN O PROTECTIVE IF IT'S A SHORT LIVED SPIKE IN A DRENNAL YOWOT CHRONICALLY I E DON'T A CONEXTRSS THA LIKE THAT'S NOT GOOD WE KNOW THAT FROM THE BEAUTIFUL WORKOFBRUSE MACUAN AT OBYALS YAV ANOTHERS LARS IS YES SO UM BUT THEN HE ASKED UM SHOULD HE GET SICK SHOULD HE CONTINUE THE COLD SHOWERS AND AND THE ANSWER IS NO I THINK THAT UM THEN IT WOULD BE HOT SHOWERS AND HOT BATHS AND SAWON A TYPE STUFF IS PROBABLY BEAR BUT NOT SO HOT THAT IT'S STRESSFUL YE YOU REALLY WANT A REDUCED STRESS ON I ON A SOUNA ILL SYSTEM SO UM HE SOUNDS AFOR MANY REASONS LIKE A REMARKABLE TE YOUNG MAN AS AS IS YOUR DAUGHTER I CONS AGRI AND I HONOR AND T WAS AN YOU'RE REMARKABLE AND I A I REALLY MEAN THAT II FE LIKE WE COULD GO ON FOREVER EXPLORING THESE IDEAS I I ABSOLUTELY I WOULD LOVE T HAVE YOU BACK FOR ANOTHER DISCUSSION OWOR NEER NON ANY UM ABOUT YOUR RESEARCH I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME OF YOUR RESEARCH CADUAL YOUR TEACHING SCADUAL O CON EDUCATE US TO DAY THESE IDEAS ARE SO VIDALLY IMPORTANT AND AND YOU PROVIDE SO MANY REAL WORLD EXAMPLES IN FACT THIT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LOVE SO MUCH ABOUT YOUR WORK IS THAT IT'S REALLY NESTED IN REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS AND YOUR THOUGHTS AND PERSPECTIVES ON THE EDUCATION AND HOW IT COULD BE BETTER AT THE LEVEL OF EDUCATING KIDS AT HOME TEACHING OURSELVES TEACHERS UM AND THE EDUCATION SYSTEM I I HOPE WE'LL RING FAR AND WIDE UM IBECAUSE THEY THEY REALLY CAN BE IMPLEMENTED AND NOT ALL YOU ABOUT THE NEED TO PURCHASE A BUNCH OF STUFF NO IDIT IS TTIRE WETH THA DIFFERENT DISPOSITION MAY DISTI WET A DIFFERENT GOAL YET THE GOAL OF EDUCATION NEEDS TO NOT LEARNING'S NOT THE GOALITS NOT THE OUTCOME IT IS TO BE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PERSON REAT HOW IS A PERSON CHANGING THEMSELVES HAVING LEARNED THIS AND THEN YOU DESIGN THE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES TO CHANGE WHO PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE OF BECOMING IT' TO THE LEARNING IS THERE BUT IT'S NOT THE ENDPOINT IT'S JUST THE MEANS TO SOMETHING ELSE WHICH WE HAVEN'T BEEN ATTENDING TO ENOUGH AND THAT'S THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PERSON WHO THEY BECOME HAVING LEARNED THAT BEAUTIFULLY BUT UM WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE WORK YOU DO AND I CAN'T WE TO HAVE ANOTHER DISCUSSION WITH YOU ABOUT THE MERGING RESEARCH EH ALVIVAC THANK YOU THANK

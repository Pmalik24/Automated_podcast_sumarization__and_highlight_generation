REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES GO RIGHT AT EACH OTHER TO SEE WHO'SE UP FOR THE CHALLEGE OF TAKING ON DONALD TRUMP TRUOM STRAD RULING COULD BE THE MOST DAMAGING BLOW TO HIS CANDIDATESE YET AND A MASS CRIMES THREE IN GULFS THE NATION I'M BEN FEARE LES IS THE VENTHPIROSHOW  TO DAY SHOW SPONSERABACKXPRESS WE PT DO YOU LIKE YOUR RIBE HISTERY BEING SEEN AND SOLD TO ADVERTISERS NOW MEAN YEU THER GUN EXPRESS WE PAN RIGHT OUT EXPRESS WE CANS I CALM SLASH MEN SO PRELIMINARY NOTE TODAY NOON EASTERN TIME I WILL BE SPEAKING WITH ELON MASK OVER ON AXTHERS AND EXSPACE WERE GEN TO BE TALKING ABOUT ELON MASK AN HIS FIGHT WITH THE ANTIDEFIMATION LEAGUAN STANDARS OF FREE SPEECH ON AX AS WELL AS ADVERTISING PRESSHIRE ON AX SO IF YOU WANTA CHECK THAT OUTMAKTSURE TO HEAD ON OVER TWO EX SPACES AT NOON EASTERN TIME O K SO LAST NIGHT WAS THE SECOND BIG REPUBLICAN DEBANE BY BIG I MEAN DONAL TRUMP WAS IN PART OF IT AND OF COURSE THERE'S NO WAY TO TALK ABOUT THE DEBAT WITHOUT TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE FRONT RUNNER BY THIRTY POINTS IN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE RIGHT NOW WAS NOT PART OF THE DEBATE AND WHEN THE FRONT RUNER ISN'T THERE IT TURNS IN TO A BIT OF A CRAB POT MEANING EVERYBODY'S JUST PULLING EACH OTHER NOW THATE THERE'S NO WAY TO AVOID THAT SORT OF OPTIC THE QUESTION IS IS ANYONE WENN MERGE FRUM THAT CRAB POT CHACTUALLY CHALLENGE DONAL TRUMP NOW HERE'S THE REALITY BELIEVEITER N HOWWER STILL PRETTY EARLY IN THIS RACE IT IS ONLY SEPTEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH AT THIS POINT IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RACE WHICH IS SORT  LAST OPEN PRIMARY RACE THAT WE HADE BEFORE TRUMP STEPPED ON OF THE SCENE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AT THIS POINT THERE WAS A RUNNING GUN BATTLETO RUDIGULYONY AND MAKE HUCKAY FOR THY RE PUBLICAN NOMINATION IN FACT EVEN IN THE TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN REPUBLICAN PRIMARY POLES DONAL TRUMP WAS WAS LEADING AT THIS POINT BUT HE WASN'T LIKE WAY OUT AHEAD WAS STILL PRETTY COMPETITIVE AT THIS POINT INOTHER WORDS SOME THINGS CAN STILL HAPPEN NOW IS THAT LIKELY IS THAT IS THAT THE MOST LIKELY THING HAT IS ON THE MOST LIKELY THING TO HAPPEN HOWEVER IT IS PRETTYOVIOUS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS SOME VULNERABILITIES IN PLACES  LIKE IWA SO FOR EXAMPLE DESPITE THE FACT THAT DONAL TRUMP IS LEADING SIGNIFICANTLY IN IWA AND ALSO IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WHEN ASKED WHICH CANDIDATES OURE BEING CONSIDERED BY VOTERS IN IWA AN NEW HAMPSHIRE A HUGE NUMBER OF IWA VOTERS AND NUW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS ARE SAYING AF THEYARE CONSIDERING CANDIDATES OTHER THEN DONALD TRUMPS THEY'RE NOT LOCKED INTO TRUMP BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION ANOTHERWORDS OF SOMETHING TERRIBLE WERE TO HAPPEN IN TRUMPS CANDIDATESE THE'RE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHOUD PRESUMABLY SHIFT OVER RIGHT NOW FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT THAT S B S NEWS POLE FROM YUGOV WHAT IT CHOSE IS THAT AN IWA ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT OF THE VOTER BLOCK SAYS THEY WILL VOTE ONLY TRUMP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THAT NUMBERS ABUT TWENTY THREE PERCENT WHICH MEANS EIGHTY PER CENT AN IWA AND SEVENTY SEVEN PER CENT IN IT NEW HAMPSHIRE OUR SAYING THAT THEY WILL CONSIDER CANDIDATES OTHER THAN TRUMP THIRTY ONE PER CENTS OF VOTERS AND IWA SAY TEY WILL NOT CONSIDER TRUMP AT ALL THIRTY FOUR PER CENT OF VOTERS IN NEW HAMPSHRES IF THEY WILL NOT CONSIDER TRUMP AT ALL AND MEANWHILE OF ASK BOLK OF TE VOTERS IN THE MIDDLE THE PLURALITY OF VOTERS IN TE MIDDLE IN BOTH IWA AND NUW HAMPSHIRE SAY THEYWILL CONSIDER TRUMP AND OTHER CANDIDATES WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IS THAT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSIDERING TRUMP AND OTHER CANDIDATES ARE SPLITTING ABOUT HALF AND HALF FOR TRUMP 'S O TRUMP'S GOT THAT LOCKED IN BASE OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE PER CENT IN THESE EARLY STATES AND THEN THE OTHER FORTY TO FIFTY PER CENTS OF VOTERS WHO SAY THAT THEY'RE CONSIDERING TRUMP PLUS EVERYBODY ELSE ARE SPLITING ABOUT HALF FOR TRUMP AND HALF FOR EVERYBODY ELSE INCE THE FIELD IS LOOKING VERY FRAGMENTIT AND THE SAME THNG IS HAPPENING WITH THE PEOPLE E'RE NOT CONCEDRNING TRUMP AT ALL THEY'RE FRAGMENTING ABONG A BUNCH OF OTHER CANDIDATE SO IT'S IT POSSIBLE THAT SOMEBODY COULD THEORETICALLY CONSOLIDATE THE REST OF THESE VOTERS IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FIELD WOULD HAVE TO WINO DRAMATICALLY AND THAT PERSON WOULD HAVE TO TAKE VOTS DIRECTLY AWAY FROM TRUMP T WOULDN'T JUST BE A MATTER O PICING UP EVERYBODY WHOSE ANTI TRUMP THAT'S ONLY ABOUT THIRTY THREE PER CENT OF THE REPUBLICAN BASE AT THIS POINT THEY WOULD SOMEHOW HAVE TO TAKE THE OTHER FORTY FIVE PER CENT TH BACE AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO WIN THAT PER CENTED TO THE BASE OR LEAT SPLIT IT IN SIGNIFICANT FASHION S THAT'S THE STATE OF THE RACE AS WE MOVE IN TO THIS DEBATE NOW THE FIELD IS TO BATE I'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT IS GOING TO CONSOLIDATE RIGHT NOW THERE'S THREE CANDIDATESWHO ARE PROBABLY ON THE BUBBLELEBY TIM SCOT CHRIS CHRISTIAND UGBURGHAM THE VAKE IS SELF FUNDED AND NOT REALLY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENTS ANYWAY AND THEREFORE HE CAN STAY IN FOR PRETTY MUCH AS LONG AS HE WANTS WITH THAT SAID THE FIELD IS LIKELY TO WINNOW AND SO BY THE TIME WE HAVE ANOTHER DEBATE WE ARE PRBABLY CAN BE LOOKING AT NICKEY HALEY RON TO SANTIS PENCS PROBABLY WILL BE OUT BY THAT POINT OUT OMANGION SHE'RE LOOKING AT PROBABLY HAYLEY VERSES TO SANTIS IS HOW THIS RACE IS STARTING TO SHAKE DOWN NOUP ARE THSE PEOPLE DEFINITELY GON AN DROP OUT WHIT YOUR CHRIS CHRISTY YOU'RE JUST WAITING INTO NEW HAMPSHIRE YOU'RE HOPING THAT THE ANTI TRUMP BASE CAN SOLIDATE TO NEW HAMPTUR SUFFICIENT TWO ACTUALLY SHOWS SO MOMENTUM OVER THERE BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE STATE OF THE RACE RIGHT NOW IN SID THEIR PUBLICAN PARTY HAYLEY INTO SANTIS ARE THE TWO MOST VIBLE CANDIDATES O I SAY THE TWO MOST VIABLE THEY'RE NOT ON EVEN FOOTING TOSANTUS IS WELL AHEAD OF HAILY IN IWA AND THE RUNING ABOUT EVEN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE SO IF THE SANTUS STARCS TO PICK UP SOME MOMENT ON WHICH HAS BEEN THESTORE OF THIS CAMPAIGN IS THE DE SANTIS HAS BEEN A SOLID NUMBER TWO AND HE HAS NEVER CAUGHT FIRE THAT'S BEEN THE STORY OF THE CAMPAIGN SO FAR AGAIN I AM SOMEBODY WHO IS VERY SUPPORT FOR GOVERNOR TO SANTIS AN THN YEU MAKE A PHENOMINAL PRESIDENT I LIKE NICKEY HAILEY I BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF GOVERNOR TO SANTIS AND HIS CANDIDACY PRETTY MUCH THIS ENTIRE TIME IN TRURMS OF WHODWIFINK WOULD MAKE THE BEST PRESIDENT AMONG THE CANDIDATESO ARE ON THE STAGE WELL WITH THAT SID EVERYBODY'S STILL WAITING FOR HIS CAMPAGN TO ACTUALLY INITIATE AND THAT THAT THERE'S BEEN SORT OF A STAGNATION TO THE RACE IT'S BEEN A VERY STABLE RACE BASICALLY SINCE JULY SINCE JUNE JULY WHEN WHEN DISANTUIS FIRST TO JUMP INTO THE RACE SO DID THE DEBATE CHANGE ANYTHING LAST NIGHT O THE SHORT ANSWER IS NOW THE BATE CHANGE NOTHING SO DONAL TRUMP BASICALLY USED THE THE WAR GAMES A STRATEGY THE ONLY WHEN HE MOVE IS NOT TO PLAY NON'L TRUMPTON SHOW UP HE REALISE THAT IF HE DID SHOW UP HOE'D GET ATTACK BY ALL THE OTHER CANDIDATES ON A WIDE VARIETY OF ISSUES HE WAS ATTACKD BY THEM ANYWAY FOR NOT SHOWING UP INSTEAD HE DECIDED TAT HE'S GOING TO JET OVER TO MICHIGAN AND WHO'S GOING TO DO AN EVENT WITH LIKE A FEW AUTO WORKER IS IN AND CLAIM SOLIDARITY WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE UNION OVER THERE VE NOTH UNION HAS SHUN HIM AND THERE JUST LICKING THE BOOTS OF JOBIDON WO SIMULTANEOUSLY LICKING THEIR BOOTS AS WELL WITH THAT SAD HIM AVOIDING THE EBATE NATURALLY MEANS THAT EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM IS FIGHTING EACH O THER AND NOT TONAL TRUMP WHICH IS THAY WIN FOR DONAL TRUMK AND THAT SORT OF THE DYNAMIC LASENER'S A LOT O PEOPLE TALKING OVER EACH OTHER PEOPLE TRYING TO GET AGGRESSIVE PEOPLE ATTEMPTING TO FIGHT EACH OTHER AND IT TURNED INTO A MASS IT'S A BIT OF A DOG'S BREAKFAST WILL GETS THAT MOMENTARILY FIRST YOU KNOW COMPANY IS LOOKING OUT FOR YU WHEN THEY ACTUALLY UP GRATER SERVICE AND DON'T CHARGE OT FOR

JOBITON'S POCKET BECAUSE HE IS IN THEIR POCKET HE SAYS IN A ROBEROS OF POCKET BEING IN IN ANY CASE DONALD DONALD TRUMP GOES THERE AND HE AND HE SPEAKS ABOUT THE AUTO WORKERS AND GET SOME HAVE LINES THIS IS SMART POWLITIC CAN BY TRUMP AGAIN HE HE'S HE DOES HAVE AN INATE INSTINCT FOR GETTING ATTENTION AND FOR MISDIRECTING ME CAMERAS TO A PLACE HE WANTS THEM BE WHICH IS WIET IS SO ALL FIRED FRUSTRATING THAT FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS DONALD TRUMP HIS NOT USE THAT MAGICAL POWERNERS TDIRECT ATTENTION WHERE IT SHOULD BE IN ANY CASE HE GOES TO MICHIGAN ANDA AND HE JUMPS IN ONA ON HIS TRADE O TRUNDA SUGGESTING THAT GLOBALIZATION OR WHAT HE CALLS GLOBALISM NOT QUITE THE SANTHING MAY THE GLOBALISM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR UT FOR WHAT'S GOING ON SHOUL GIVE ME FOR MORE YEARS AND I WILL GIVE YOU THE END TO THIS HORRIBLE GLOBALISM THAT'S KILLING OUR COUNTRY I CAN YO TO RE TURN OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICAS THE GREATES AN STRONGES A DUS ONATION A  I ON OER TO GAN THE WE WILL THIS MANOF THE CORRUP POWER STRUCTURE THAT IS FEASTED AN THE SUFFERING OF THE AMERICAN AUTO WORKER AND THE WORKERS OF ANY KIND NOT JUST OTO WORKERS WORKERS OF ANY KIND WE WILL CAST FOR POWER THE FINANCIAL FORCES THAT HAVE TURNED AMERICAN SITIES AND TO GHOSTOUNS TO BUILD SKYSCRAPERS IN BAGING CHINA WE WILL WIELD EVERY LEVER OF GOVERNMENT TO DEFEND YOU ANT TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE THOSE WHO AV PROFIT FROM THE BETRAYAL AND SUFFERING UP THE AMERICAN FACTORY WORKERS SO SATOSY AS YOUR FORTY SEVENTH PRESIDENT OF THE ANENTSTATES I WILL BE YOUR PROTECTOR I WILL BE YOUR ADVOCATE AND I WILL BE YOUR GREATEST CHANTIN TE GRINSCHA AN I IH THAT ALOUT OF THE SUFFIS TRUDSO I THINK THAT MANUFACTURING TROUSING AN COME FLOWING BACK INTO THE UNITED STATES THANKS TO PRESIDEEN TRUMP I CANMY I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT ANYBODY HAS THE CAPACITY TO BRING MANUFACTURING COBS LIKE NINETEEN FIFTY STAU MANUFACTURING OBS FACT TOR THE UNITED STATES THAT'S NOT WHAT THE STATISTIC SHOW HOWEVER IS THAT A SOLID MID WESTERN RUSBELT PITCH SURE IT HIS BETTER PITCER IS GOING AFTER THE BY ADMINISTRATION FOR THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANDATE THIS OBVIOUSLY IS TRUKE HERE IS HERE IS TRUMK YESTERDAY IN MICHINGAN EN DEY WANT I WILL TURMINAO BY IN ELECTRIC VEICO MANDA I WILL CAN TOLE RECOP CILLING RECULATION THAT I STRUCTION AMERICAN AUTO WORKERS I WILL UNLEESH A THING CALLED AMERICAN ENERGY STOP THE BAN ON THE IN TURNOR COMPUSTION ANGON AND WE WILL RILL BAB DILL AN WE WILL WI AND SO I'M AGAN ALL OF THAT IS GOT ANY SMART FOR TRUM TO GO TO MICHIGAN GETS ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE DBATE NOW THE BIGGEST ISSUE THAT TRUMP IS ABOUT TO FACE IS ACTUALLY THIS FRAUD CASE SO BELIEV HE'RE NOT ALL OF THE CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS THAT HE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE COMMITTED I THINK THREE OF THE FOUR CROLINAL CASES ARE BEASSET THINK ONE ON CLASSFIED DOCUMENTS IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR HIM   TO DEFEAT JUST IN THE IN THE ACTUAL COURT OF LAW BECAUSE HE SAYS ONTAPE THAT HE DOES THE GRIME BUT THOSE ARE NOT REALLY THE BIGES THREATS IN THE BIGGEST THREATS HIM IN THE THING I'M I'M SURE THAT HE IS WORRE THE MOST ABOUT IS THIS FRAUD CASE IN NEW YORK NOW THE FRAUD CASEIS ABSURD IT'S NROM SURD CASE SO LAW IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK I LOOKED IT UP YESTERDAY THE LAW IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK SUGGEST THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS CAPABLE OF WHAT THEY CALL DISGORGEMENTS OF PROFITS OF A BUSINESS EVEN IF NO CRIME HAS ACTIOUN BEN COMMITTED AGAINST ANY ONE S THEY'RE NOT CHARGEING WIT THE CRIME THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT CONVICTING YOU OF FRAUD YOU HAVE NOT TO FRAUD IN ANY ONE IN THE SENSE THAT THE PERSON WHO YOU SUPPOSEDLY BAMBOOZLED IS NOT SUING YOU IT'S HEOU AND I MAKE A REAL STATE DEAL I INFLATE THE VALUE OF MY REAL STATE ASSETS YOU KNOW I'M INFLATINGTHE VALUED BY REAL ISTATE ASSETS YOU MAKE ME THE LONE WE BOTH PROFIT SO THERE IS NO LOSS BY YOU IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SHOW LOSS THE  STATE OF NEW YORK DOES NOT HAVE TO SHOW LOSS THERE IS NOUGH TO BEN CRIMINAL FRAUD THEY CAN THEN PUSH FOR DISGORGEMEN OF PROFITS BY FILING A CIVIL LOSSUT AND THA'S PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED IN THE STATE OFNEW YORK TO THE TUNE OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AGAINST TRUMPS BUSINESSES WHICH IS WILD I MEAN THAT'S WILD THAT'S A THAT'S THAT'S A CRAZY REGIMENT OF LAW THAT IF THEY DETACT THEY THINK CIVILLY THAT YOU COMMITTED AS SERIES OF FRAUDS ANDOTHERWORE TO JUST COMPLETELY KEPT INFLATING THE VALUE OF YOUR ASSETS IN ORDER TO A GET DEALS AT AT LOWER INTRESTRATS THE MAKE NEW YOR INFLAGHTING THEY GAVYO THE LONE ANYWAY THE STAKE CAN THEN COME IN POST FACTO AFTER EVERY ONE IS BENEFITED AND DONE GRAT AND THE STATE HAS GOT MORE TAXES CAS EVERYBODY DEGRATE AND THEY CAN DISGORGE THE PROFITS FROM YOU BY IDENTIFYING A PATTERN OR PRACTICE OF FRAUDULENT CONDUCT SO IT'S NINNING ABOUT FINDING AT HARM THERE'S NO HARM NOW NORMALLY IN A CASE H HAVE TO SHOW HARM HERENG YAM HAV TO SHAW HARM YUST GO AFTER PEOPLE SO HERE IS WHAT IS HAPPEING IN THAT CASE ACCORDING TO THE YOUR TIMES IN YOUR TJUDGE RULED ON TUESDAY THAT TRUMP PERSISTENTLY COMITTED FRAUD BY INFLATING VALUE OF HIS ASSETS AND STRIPP THE FARMER PRESIDENT OF CONTROL OVER SOME OF HIS SIGNATURE NEW YORK PROPERTIES THERE'S A REAL PROME FOR TRUM IF ALL HIS PROPERTIES GOING TO RECEIVERSHIP THAT IS A HEAVY DUTY BURDEN ON HIS ASETS SO IF HE IS USING THOSE ASSETS TO SAY TAKE LOANS OUT AGAINST THE ASSETS IN ORDER TO RAISE LEGAL FUNDS THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE TO HIM IT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE FOR HIM ELECT TORALLY SPEAKING SO ACCORDING TO THE YOR TIMES THE SUPPRISING DECISION BY JUST AS ARTHOR ANGERON IS A MAJOR VICTORY FOR A TURNING GENERAL AT TISU JAMES IN HER LOSSOUT AGAINST TA TRUMP EFFECTIVELY DECIDING NO TRIAL IS NEEDED TO DETERMIND THAT HE HAD FRAUGINALLY SECURE FAVORABLE TRUMS ON LONES AN INSURANCETEELS HAMESIS ARGUED THAT TRUMP INFLATED THE VALUE OF HIS PROPERTIES BY AS MUCH AS TOO POING TO BILLION DOLLARS AND I SEEKING A PENALTY OF ABOUT TWO UNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLL LERS IN A TRIAL SCHEDULE TO BEGIN IS EARLY HIS MONDAY NOW IF THAT GOES FORWARD AND THESE PROPERTIES ARE PUTTINTO RECEIVERSHIP WHAT THAT MEANS THAT TRUMP CANT MANAGE HIS ON BUSINESSES THOSE BUSINESS IS NOW GOD TO THE HANDS OF A THIRD PORTY RECEIVER WHO DECIDES HOW TO DISPOSE OF THE ASSETS TWO PAY OFF CREDITORS FOR EXAMPLE AND ONE OF THOSE CREDITORS NOW WOULD BE THE STATE OF NEW YORK TO THE TOUNE OF TO UN OR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TRUM FOR HIS PART SAID THAT JUSTICE EN GRON WAS A DEMOCRATY CALLE THEM DERANGED WHILE THE TRAVELOLD DETERMIN THE SIZE OF THE ENALTY ANGRON'S RULING GRANCE OF OE OF THE BIGGEST PUNISHMENTS AT JAMES SOUGHT THE CANCILLATION OF BUSINESS CERTIFIT GETS THAT ALLOW SOME OF TRUMPS IN YORK PROPERTIES TO OPERATE A MOVE THAT COUL HAVE MAJOR REPROCUSTIONS FOR THE TRUMP FAMILY BUSINESS THE DECISION COULD TERMINATE HIS CONTROL OVER A FLAGH OF COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AT FORTY WALL STREET AND LOWER MANHATTEN A FAMILY ESTATE WESTCHESTER COUNTY THE TRUMP TOWER AN MINTOWN MANHATTEN HIS GOLF CLUB IN WEST CHESTER IT WOULDN'T DISSOLVE THE COMPANY BUT THE ECISION COULD HAVE A SWEEPING IN PACT ON THE COMPANIES NEW YORK OPERATIONS WOULD SHUT DOWN IN ENTITY THAT EMPLOYS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WORKING FOR HIM IN NEW YORK EFFECTIVELY DESTROYING THE COMPANY SO THIS IS LIKE A SERIOUS FULL FRUNT TO ASSAULT ON DONALD TRUMPS FINANCIAL WHEREWITH ALL HIS ASSET BASE IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK WHICH IS WHERE THE MAJORITY O HIS ASSETS ARE LOCATED AND NOT ONLY THAT INCUMBERAS THE ASSETS FOR HIS KIDS SO EVEN IF TRUMPER STUFF OFF THE POLITICAL STAGE TO MORROW EVEN IF GOD FORBID SIM THEY WERE TO HAPPEN HIM TO MORROW IT WOULD THEN ENCUMBER THE ASSETS FOR HIS CHILDREN SO THIS IS A REAL THREAT TWO DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE IT BEAN IF HE DOESO DOE THAT MONEY TO RUN HIS CAMPAIGN WHERE'SOME ONE OGN TO COME FROM PRESUMABLY TON KEEP COMING FOM DOWNERS OR OUNING MONEY TO HIS CAMPAIGN E'S GING TO USE IT TO PAY OFF ALL OF HIS LEGAL BILLS NONE OF THAT MONEYSCGINS GETSMEN ON ELECTIONEERIN 'S YORN'S I ROUT ELECTION INTER FERENCE THIS CASE ACTUALLY MIGHT BE THE LARGESTACK OF LECTION INTERFERENCE IN THE ENTIRE ELECTION CYCLE AND THAT SOMETHING POPLE SHOULD TAKE IN TO ACCOUNT AGAIN IF WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT IS VICTORY OVER JOBIDON MASSIVE BURDENS ON THE REPUBLICAN FRONT RUNNER MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO WIN YES THEREA BEEN SOME POSITIOE POLES FOR DONALD TRUMPET IN THE RECENT PASS WHERE ALLSO YOURE AND A HALF OUT FROM THE ELECTION FOUR CRIMINALD CASES HAVE YGET TO TAKE PLACE AND IF HIS ASSETS GOING TO RECEIVERSHIP HE'S GOT A SERIOUS PROBLEM ON HIS HANDS HEREIN LIES THE PROBLEM AND THIS IS THE CASE THAT REALLY NOBODY MADE THE TOE BATE LAST NIGHT IT'S A VERY SIMPLE CASE NO ONE ON THE STAGI IS LOST TO JOBIDON HERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON WHO'S LOST TO JOBIDN DONALD TRUMP YLOST O JOBIN AN TWENTY TWENTY RUN ME RIGHT THAT'S WHAT EVERY ONE OLL STATIOULD BEN SANG THES LAST NIGHT RUN ME I DON'T LOS TOBIDON YOU DINSYHT POLES BUT THOSE SAME POLES SUGGEST THAT DONALD TRUMP IS RUNNING DEAD EVEN WITH  JOBIDON AND AGAIN DONALD TRUMP THUGH THOSE PULLS HAD HILLERD COM AS CAN BE DONAL TRUM SO THERE'S ONLY ONE THING WE DO KNOW IS THAT IN AN ACTUAL VOTING TUST DONALD TRUMP LOST TWO JOBIDON AND SO IF YOUR RULING TAKE TAT RISK AGAN GO DONAL TRUMP BUT WHORE HE COULD GO WITH SOMEBODY WHO HASN'T LOST TO JOBIDON BEFORE IF VAC TROBIDONS MADE PETTY CLEAR THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO RUN AGAINST DONAL TRUMP MY THAT'S THE CASE THAT EVERYBODY BASICALLY SHOULD AVE BEN MAKING ON THE STAGE LAST NIGHT AND NOBODY ACTION MADE THAT CASE WHICH IS ALWAYS KIND OF SURPRISING TO ME AGAIN THE POLES ARE SO L OVER THE PLACE ERES ANOTHER POLE OUT TO DAY FROM THE ECONOMIST YOU GO AND SHOES BIDN UP FIVE SO INSIDE THE SPASE OF LIKE A WEEK YOU'VE AN EIGHTY SEE NHOIS WASH INGTON POSTPOTHROM TRUMPEPTEN AND THEN YOU HAVE NE CONMIS TUGOV POLES SHOWING BY NUT FIVE I THAT IS A FIFTEEN POINTS WING THAT'S SO WERE THE HELLO I DON'T NOW WHERE TH POLLS ARE WHET I DO KNOT IS THAT TRUMP HAS VERY MAJOR SO STEMAC HURDLES THAT HE'S GEEN TO HAVE TO OVERCOME THEN HE IS HE THISS NOT IN EASY ELECTION FOR HIM BY ANY STRUCTURE THE IMAGINATION AND EVERY SINGLE LEGAL ROIN COMES DOWN AGAINST HIM JUSTIFI D OR UNJUST FIGHT IT DOESN'T MATHER WHETHER DECISION IS RIGHT OR WRETHER THE DECISION IS WRONG THE ONLYVING THE MATTERS IS WHETHER IT STOPS FROM FROM FROM BEATING JOBIDOEN AND MEANWHILE GAVAN KNEW SOME WHO IS LIKE DESPERATELY HANGING AROUND IN THE HOPES THAT JOBIDIN DIES MEAN THAT THAT'S ALL I CAN IMAGIN HE'S DOING HERE BECAUSE THE YEARS TWENTY TWENTY FOUR NOT TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT HIS SITTING GOVERNOR CALIFORNIAM HE SHUT UP AT THE DEBATE HE LIKE CRASH THE PARTY AND SHUT UP AT THE DEBATE I DON'T NO ONE KNOWS WHY EXCEPT

WELCOME TO THE HUBERMEN LAPONCAS  AT SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TO I MAN DOUR HUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NEROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY'S PODCAST EPISODE IS ALL ABOUT SLEEP WE'RE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE MIRROR IMAGE OF SLEEP WHICH IS WAKEFULNESS NOW THESE TWO PHASES OF OUR LIFE SLEEP AND WAKEFULNESS GOVERN EVERYTHING ABOUT OUR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH AND WE'RE NOT JUSTGOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S USEFUL ABOUT SLEEP WE'RE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO GET BETTER AT SLEEPING AND THAT WILL INCLUDE HOW TO GET BETTER AT FALLING A SLEEP TIMING YOUR SLEEP AND ACCESSING BETTER SLEEP QUALITY IN DOING SO WERE ALSO GON AND DISCUSS HOW TO GET MORE FOCUSED AND ALERT IN WAKEFULNESS SO BECAUSE SLEEP IN WAKEFULNESS ARE RELATED WE REALLY CAN'T HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER NOW IN KEEPING WITH THIS THEME YOU MAY CATCH A FEW SNORES IN THE BACKGROUND UNLIKE ME MY BULLDOG COSTELLO CAN FALL ASLEEP ANYWHERE ANY TIME AND HE HAPPENS TO BE SLEEPING OVER THERE IN THE CORNER SO YOU HEAR SNORING THAT'S WHAT THAT'S ABOUT AS ALWAYS I WANTED JUST MENTION THAT THIS PODCAST IS PART OF MY EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER PUBLIC EDUCATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS IT IS UNRELATED TO MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS ATH LETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASEN I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS OND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT HELPS ME COVER ALL F MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GUP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTALY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS I GET THEVITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBICS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRIATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK AM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'LL GIVE YOU FI FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DATAND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF WORE GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICION IN VITEMEN D THREE AND K TWO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREENSTOCK CAM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FI FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLITES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND PATASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR I'VE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE IN THIS PODCAST ABOUT KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLYTES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AN ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIA MANESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOES ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMON SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENTY DOC CALM SLASH HUBERMENT AND YOU'L GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHAS THEY'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENTY DO CALM SLASH HUBERMAN SO LET'S TALK ABOUT SLEEP SLEEP IS THIS INCREDIBLE PERIOD OF OUR LIVES WHERE WE ARE NOT CONSCIOUS WE MIGHT DREAM WE MIGHT TWICH WE MIGHT EVEN WAKE UP BUT IN SLEEP WE ARE ONLY IN RELATION TO THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING WITHIN OUR BRAIN AND BODY OUTSIDE SENSORY EXPERIENCE IN MOST CASES CAN'T REALLY IMPACT US AND YET SLEEP IS THIS TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT PERIOD OF LIFE BECAUSE IT RESETS AORE ABILITY TO BE FOCUST ALERT AND EMOTIONALLY STABLE IN THE WAKEFUL PERIOD SO WE CAN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT WAKEFULNESS FOCUS MOTIVATION MOOD WELL BEING WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT SLEEP AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE DEVOTING THIS ENTIRE MONTH TO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT SLEEP BUT WE ALSO CAN'T TALK ABOUT SLEEP AND THINK ABOUT SLEEP WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT WAKEFULNESS BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT THE PERIOD THAT WE CALL SLEE AND THE PERIOD WE CALL WAKEFULNESS ARE TETHERED TO ONE ANOTHER WHAT WE DO IN THE WAKING STATE DETERMINES WHEN WE FALL ASLEEP HOW QUICKLY WE FALL ASLEEP WHETHER NOT WE STAY ASLEEP AND HOW WE FEEL WHEN WE WAKE UP THE NEXT DAY AND TO DAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK MOST SLEEP ABOUT HOW TO GET BETTER AT SLEEPING AND THE REASON FOR STARTING THE CONVERSATION THAT WAY AS OPPOSE TO JUST DIVING INTO A LOT OF BIOLOGY ABOUT SLEEP IS BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE ALREADY ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF SLEEP WE'RE GONG TO TOUCH ON A LITTLE BIT OF THIS THINGS LIKE STAGES OF SLEEP AND SLEEP SPINDLES MELATONAN AND DREAMING BUT I THINK THAT BY NOW MOST PEOPLE ARE AWARE THAT GETTING A REALLY GOOD NIGHT SLEEP ON A CONSISTENT BASIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT IN FACT I'M GUESSING THAT VERY FEW OF YOU OUT THERE ARE CONSISTENTLY GETTING SEVEN TO NINE HOURS OF REALLY TERRIFIC SLEEP WAKING UP FEELING RESTED LIKE YOU'RE READY TO ATTACK THE DAY AND BEING ABLE TO GO THROUGH THE DAY FEELING FOCUSED AN ALERT WITHOUT DIPS IN ENERGY OR FOCUS SO IF YOU'RE LIKE MOST PEOPLE WHICH INCLUDES ME YOU HAVE SOME CHALLENGES WITH SLEEP LEAST EVERY THIRD OR FIFT NIGHT OR SO AND MAY BE EVEN MORE OFTEN SO REALLY GON TO GO TOOL HEAVY TO DAY AND TALK ABOUT TOOLS THAT CAN HELP YOU FALL ASLEEP SLEEP BETTER AND EMERGE FROM SLEEP FEELING MORE RESTED AND WE'RE GING TO DO THAT BY GROWNDING OURE DISCUSSION OF TOOLS IN PURE REVIEWED STUDIES MOSTLY FROM THE LAST TEN YEARS ALTHOUGH SOME EVEN MORE RECENT THAN THAT AND WE'RE GING TO START BY DISCUSSING WHAT IS SLEEP AND WHAT GOVERNS THE TIMING OF THE ONSET OF SLEEP IN OTHER WORDS WHAT MAKES YOU GET SLEEPY AT A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY SO WHAT DETERMINES HOW WELL WE SLEEP AND THE QUALITY OF OUR WAKEFUL STATE TURNS OUT THAT'S GOVERNED BY TOO FORCES THE FIRST FORCE IS A CHEMICAL FORCE IT'S CALLED A DENISINE A DENISINE IS A MOLECULE IN OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND BODY THAT BUILDS UP THE LONGER WE ARE AWAKE SO IF YOU'VE JUST SLEPT FOR EIGHT OR NINE OR TEN REALLY DEEP RESTFUL HOURS A DENISINE IS CAN BE VERY LOW IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY IF HOWEVER YOU'VE BEEN AWAKE FOR TEN FIFTEENE OR MORE HOURS A DENISINE LEVELS ARE GOING TO BE MUCH HIGHER A DENISINE CREATES A SORT OF SLEEP DRIVE OR A SLEEP HUNGER AND ACTUALLY HUNGER IS THE APPROPRIATE WORD HERE BECAUSE FOR MOST OF WHAT WERE GOING TO DISCUSS TO DAY WE CAN THINK OF IT IN AN ANALOGOUS WAY TO NUTRITION YOU'RE NUTRITION AND HOW WELL YOU FEEL AFTER YOU EAT CERTAIN FOODS YOUR OVER ALL LEVEL OF FITNESS AND YOUR CELLDER HEALTH AND YOUR HEART HEALTH ISN'T GOVERNED BY ANY ONE FOOD ITEM THAT YOU MIGHT EAT OR NOT EAT IT'S GOVERNED BY A NUMBER DIFFERENT FACTORS HOW OFTEN YOU EAT HOW MUCH YOU EAT WHICH ITEMS YOU EAT ET CETERA AND WHAT WORKS BEST FOR YOU IN THE SAME WAY YOUR SLEEP AND YOUR WAKEFULNESS ARE THE PRODUCT OF KIND OF THE AVERAGE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN AWAKE IS A KEY ONE BECAUSE OF THIS MOLECULE A DENISINE SO THE REASON YOU GET SLEEPY WHEN YOU'VE BEEN UP FOR WHILES BECAUSE A DENISINE IS CREEPING UP STEADILY THE LONGER YOU'VE BEEN AWAKE AND A GOOD WAY TO REMEMBER THIS AND THINK ABOUT A DENISINE IS TO THINK ABOUT CAFFINE KAFFINE FOR MOST PEOPLE EXCEPT A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WAKES THEM UP IT MAKES THEM FEEL MORE ALERT IN FACT SOME PEOPLE ARE SO SENSITIVE TO CAFFINE THAT THEY FEEL GITTERY IF THEY DRINK IT EVEN IN SMALL AMOUNTS OTHER PEOPLE CAN DRINK LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAFFINE AND NOT FEEL JEDGITTERY AT ALL CAFFINE ACTS AS AND A DENISINE ANTAGONIST WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT WHEN YOU INGEST KAFFINE WHETHER NOT'S COFFEE OR SODA OR TEA OR IN ANY OTHER FORM IT BINDS TOO THE ADENISINE RECEPTOR IT SORT OF PARKS THERE JUST LIKE A CAR WOULD PARK IN A GIVEN PARKING SLOT AND THEREFORE A DENISINE CANT PARK IN THAT SLOT NOW WHEN KAFFINE PARKS IN THE ADENISINE RECEPTOR SLOT NOTHING REALLY HAPPENS DOWN STREAM OF THAT RECEPTOR THE RECEPTOR CAN'T ENGAGE THE NORMAL CELLAR FUNCTIONS OF MAKING THAT SELL AND YOU FEEL SLEEPY SO THE REASON KAFFINE WAKES YOU UP IS BECAUSE IT BLOCKS THE SLEEPINESS RECEPTOR IT BLOCKS THE SLEEPY SIGNAL AND THIS IS WHY WHEN THAT KAFINE WEARS OFF A DENISINE WILL BIND TO THAT RECEPTOR  SOMETIMES WITH EVEN GREATER WHET WE CALL AFFINITY AND YOU FEEL THE CRASH YOU FEEL ASPECIURALLY TIRED NOW I'M NOT HERE TO DEMONIZE KAFFINE I LOVE KAFFINE I DRINK IT IN THE MORNING AND I DRINK IT IN THE AFTERNOON BUT I'M ONE OF THESE PEOPLE THAT EITHER BECAUSE OF MY TOLERANCE OR BECAUSE OF SOME GENETIC VARIATIONS THAT EXIST AMONG PEOPLE IN TERMS OF THEIR A DENISINE RECEPTORS I CAN DRINK KAFFINE AS LAID AS FOUR OR FIVE P M IN THE EVENING AND STILL FALL ASLEEP JUST FINE SOME PEOPLE CAN'T HAVE ANY KAFFINE AT ALL OR CAN'T HAVE ANY KAFFINE PAST ELEVEN A M OR ELSE THEIR SLEEP IS TODALLY JISREPTED ALL OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEENE A DENISINE AND THESE A DENISINE RECEPTOR IS GENETIC VARIATION THINGS THAT ARE VERY HARD TO FIND OUT EXCEPT EXPERIMENTALLY MEANING EACH OF YOU NEEDS TO DESIDE AND FIGURE OUT FOR YOURSELVES WHETHER NOT YOU CAN TOLERATE KAFFINE AND AT WHAT TIMES OF DAY YOU CAN TOLERATE KAFFIN IN ORDER TO STILL FALL ASLEEP EASILY AND GET GOOD SLEEP SO RATHER THAN DEMONIZE KAFFINE OR SAY THAT YOU KNOW EVERYONE CAN DRINK KAFNE UNTIL LATE YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU KAFFINE HAS A LOT OF HEALTH BENEFITS IT ALSO FOR  SOME PEOPLE CAN BE PROBLEMATIC FOR HEALTH THAT CAN RAISE BLOOD PRESSURE AT CETERA KAFFINE INCREASES THE MOLECULE THAT'S A NUROMODULATOR THAT WE CALL DOPAMINE WE DISCUSS THIS AN EPISODE ONE WHICH TENDS TO MAKE US FEEL GOOD MOTIVATED AND GIVE US ENERGY BECAUSE AS YOU MAY HAVE LEARNED IN EPISODE ONE DOPAMINE IS RELATED TO ANOTHER NORMODULATOR CALLED EPINEFERIN WHICH GIVES US ENERGY IN FACT EPINEFRON IS MADE FROM DOPAMI LET JUST TAKE A STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TALKIAG OUT WHERE TIE BUT SLEEP SLEEPINESS SLEEPINESS IS DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN A DENISINE THAT HAPPEN NATURALLY KAFFINE PREVENCE THE ADENISINE  FROM KAFFING IT'S ACTION OF MAKING US SLEEPY BY BLOCKING THAT RECEPTOR SO GIVES US ENERGY ENDED INCREASES ARE DOPAMING LEVELS BUT SOME PEOPLE CAN'T TOLERATE KAFFINE VERY WELL OTHER PEOP CAN TOLERATE IT JUST FINE SO YOU NEED TO DETERMINE THAT EXPERIMENTALLY ALL THE DATE O SAY THERE'S TREMENDOUS VARIATION AND RIGHT NOW THE ONLY WAY THAT I'M AWARE OF FOR YOU TDODECIDE WHETHER NOT KAFFINE IS A GOOD OR A BAD THING FOR YOU AND WHETHER NOT YOU SHOULD T INGEST IT AT A GIVEN TIME A DAY OR AT ALL IS REALLY TO FIGUE THAT OUT ON YOUR OWN IN FACT THERE'S A SMALL SUBSET OF PEOPLE THAT CAN DRINK KAFFINE UNTIL VERY LATE AND THEY HAVE NO TROUBLE FALLING ASLEEP BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A MUTENT FORM OF THE A DENIINE RECEPTOR SO IN KEEPING WITH THE THEME OF SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CASES WHERE I CAN'T GIVE YOU A ONE SIZE FITS ALL PESCRIPTION EXCEPT TO SAY YOU NEED TO EXPERIMENT WITH KAFFINE IN A WAY THAT'S SAFE FOR YOU AND EXPLORE THAT AND FIGURE OUT WI WORKS FOR YOU AND THEN STICK WITH THAT OH  SO A DENIZINE IS DRIVING THI SLEEP HUNGER WHEN A DENIZINE IS LOW IT'S LIKE WERE WELL FED WERE NOT VERY HUNGRY AND WHEN A DENISINE IS HIGH IT'S LIKE WERE FASTED FOR A LONG TIME AND WE TEND TO BE VERY HUNGRY SO WHEN A DENZINE IS HIGH WE REALLY WANT TO FALL ASLEEP IF YOU WANT I'M NOT SUGGESTING YOU DO THIS EXPERIMENT BUT YOU CAN DO IT YOU CAN STAY UP FOR FOUR MORE HOURS HIN YOUR USE TO STAYING UP AND YOU'LL FIND THAT YOUARE VERY VERY SLEEPY THAT'S BECAUSE THE DENISINE IS BUILDING UP AT LEVELS HIGHER AND HIGHER BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN AWAKE FOR THOSE EXTRA FOUR HOURS HOWEVER IF YOU'VE EVER PULLED AN ALL NIGHT OR YOU'LL NOTICE SOMETHING INTERESTING AS MORNING ROLLS AROUND YOU'LL SUDDENLY FEEL AN INCREASE IN YOUR ENERGY AND ALERTNESS AGAIN EVEN THOUGH A DENISINE HAS BEEN BUILDING UP FOR BUT ENTIRE NIGHT WHY IS THAT THE REASON THAT IS IS BECAUSE THERE'S A SECOND FORCE WHICH IS GOVERNING WHEN YOU SLEEP AND WHEN YOU'RE AWAKE AND THAT FORCE IS A SO CALLED CIRCADIAN FORCE CIRCADIAN MEANS ABOUT A DAY ERE ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND INSIDE ALL OF US IS A CLOCK THAT EXISTS IN YOUR BRAIN AND MY BRAIN AND THE BRAIN OF EVERY ANIMAL THAT WE'RE AWARE OF THAT DETERMINE WHEN WE WANT TO BE SLEEPY AND WHEN WE WANT TO BE AWAKE JUST THINK ABOUT IT WE DON'T GO THROUGH THE DAY WANTING TO FALL ASLEEP EVERY THIRTY MINUTES AND THEN FEELING LIKE WERE WIDE AWAKE ORE SLEEP AND OUR PERIOD OF SLEEPINESS TENDS TO BE CONDENSED INTO ONE BLOCK TYPICALLY ONE SIX TO TEN HOUR BLOCK ALTHOUGH THERE'S ALSO VARIATION IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH PEOPLE WANT TO SLEEP AND WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS HOW YOU CAN DIGNOSE YOU'RE ABSOLUTE SLEEP NEED AS WELL AS HOW TO RECOVER SLEEP THAT YOU'VE LOST THAT BLOCK OF SLEEP AND WHEN IT FALLS WITHIN EACH TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE IS GOVERNED BY A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS BUT THE MOST POWERFUL THING THAT'S GOVERNING WHEN YOU WANT TO BE A SLEEP AND WHEN YOU WANT TO BE AWAKE IS LIGHT AND IN PARTICULAR IT'S GOVERNED BY SUNLIGHT I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT AND HOW ACTIONABLE THIS RELATIONSHIP IS BETWEIN LIGHT AND WHEN YOU WANT TO SLEEP IT'S QUITE SIMPLE ON THE FACE OF IT AND IT'S QUITE SIMPLE TO RESOLVE BUT PEOPLE TEND TO MAKE A BIG MESS OF THIS WHOLE CIRCADIAN LITERATURE FRANKLY SO LET'S JUST BREAK IT DOWN FROM THE STANDPOINT OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY AS YOU GO THROUGH ONE TWENTY FOUR HOUR DAY LET'S START WITH WAKING SO REGARDLESS OF HOW WELL YOU SLEPT AT NIGHT OR WHETHER NIGH YOU ARE UP ALL NIGHT MOST PEOPLE TEND TO WAKE UP SOME TIME AROUND WHEN THE SUN RISES MAY BE NOT RIGHT AT SUNRISE BUT WITHIN AN HOUR OR TWO OR MAY BE THREE OF SUNRISE I REALIZE THERE ARE NIGHT SHIFT WORKERS AND THEIR PEOPLE TRAVELING AND EXPERIENCING JET LAG WHERE THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE THE CASE WE ARE GOING TO DEAL WITH JET LAG AND SHIFT WORK AT THE END OF THIS POTCAST BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE WE TEND TO WAKE UP ABOUT THE TIME THAT THE SUN IS RISE SING OR SO AND AS WE DO THAT A DENISENE LEVELS TEND TO BELOW IF WE'VE BEEN ASLEEP FOR REASONS THAT YOU NOW UNDERSTAND AND OR SYSTEM GENERATES AND INTERNAL SIGNAL THAT IS IN THE FORM OF A HORMONE NOW I'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT NEUROMODULATORS AND YOUR TRANSMITTERS I HAVEN'T TALK TO LOT ABOUT HORMONES YET ON THIS POTCAST THE DEFINITION OF A HORMONE IS IT'S A SUBSTANCE A CHEMICAL THAT'S RELEASED FROM ONE ORGAN IN YOUR BODY THAT GOES AN ACTS ON OTHER ORGANS ELSEWHERE IN YOUR BODY INCLUDING YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING YOU WAKE UP BECAUSE A PARTICULAR HORMONE CALLED CORTESALL I'S RELEASED FROM YOUR DRENAL GLANDS YOUR A DRENA GLANCE AT RIGHT ABOVE YOUR KIDNEYS AND THRE'S LOTE PULSE OF CORTESAL THERE'S ALSO THE PULSE OF SOME AND WHEN I SAY A PULSE I JUST MEAN THAT THE RELEASE OF A LITTLE BIT THERE'S ALSO A PULSE OF EPINEFREN WHICH IS ADRENOLIN FROM YOUR DRENALS AND ALSO IN YOUR BRAIN AND YOU FEEL AWAKE NOW THAT PULSE OF CORTESALL AN A DRENALIN AND AP AN EFRON MIGHT COME FROM YOUR ALARM CLOCK IT MIGHT COME FROM YOU NATURALLY WAKING UP BUT IT TENDS TO ALERT YOUR PULSE SYSTEM IN YOUR BODY THAT IT'S TIME TO INCREASE YOUR HEART RADE IT'S TIME TO START TENSING YOUR MUSCLES IT'S TIME TO START MOVING ABOUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THAT CORTESAL PULSE COME EARLY IN THE DAY OR AT LEAST EARLY IN YOUR PERIOD OF WAKEFULNESS I SAY THAT BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ARE WAKING UP AT EIGHT P M IN OUR SLEEPING ALL DAY BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THAT PULSE OF CORTESALL OCCUR EARLY IN THE DAY AND THAT IT HAPPENS ALL AT ONCE IT SORT OF SETS A RISING TIDE OF CORTESL IN YOUR SYSTEM NOW MANY OF YOU OF PROBABLY HEART ABOUT CORTESALL IN RELATION TO STRESS AND INDEED AS WE GO THROUGH OUR DAY AND OUR LIFE TDIFFERENT STRESSERS DIFFERENT OF VENTS HAPPEN IN OUR LIFE THAT MAKE US FEEL MORE ALERT SOME OF THE MORE STRESSUL ONES MIGHT BE LOOKING AT YOUR CRETI CARD BILL AND SEEING A WHAT SEEMS TO BE A FRAUDULENT CHARGE OR LOOKING OUR PHONE AND SUDDENLY SEEING ATTEXT THAT SOMETHING YOU THOUGHT WAS CAN O HAPPEN A PARTICULAR TIME AS NOTCAN TO HAPPEN OR YOUR RUNNING LAT THOSE WILL TEND TO INCREASE NOR UP AN EFRON AN EPRON EFRON AND A DRENOLIN IN YOUR SYSTEM AND IF THERE SEVERE ENOUGH YOU'LL START GETTING SOME PULSES OF CORTESALL RELEASED FROM YOUR DRENALS THROUGHOUT THE DAY BUT THERE'S THIS NORMAL HEALTHY RISING TIDE OF CORTESALL THAT HAPPENS EARLY IN THE DAY AND I SAY HEALTHY BECAUSE IT WAKES YOU UP IT MAKES YOU FEEL ALERT IT MAKES YOU FEEL ABLE TO MOVE AND WANTING TO MOVE AND TO GO OUT BOUT YOUR DAY FOR WORK FOR EXERCISE FOR SCHOOL FOR SOCIAL RELATIONS ET CETERA SO WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING IS WHEN THAT CORTESALL PULSE TAKES OFF AND SOMETHING ELSE IMPORTANT HAPPENS A TIMER IS SET IN YOUR BODY AN IN YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT DICTATES WHEN A DIFFERENT HORMONE CALLED MELATONAN WHICH MAKES YOU SLEEPY WE'LL BE SECRETED FROM A PARTICULAR BRAIN REGION SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND YOU EXPERIENCE THAT RISE IN CORTESAL THERE'S A TIMER THAT STARTS GOING AND THESE ARE CELULAR TIMERS AND THEYARE DICTATED BY THE RELATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT ORGANS IN YOUR BODY THAT SAYS TO TO YOUR BRAIN INBODY THAT IN ABOUT TWELVE TO FOURTEEN HOURS A DIFFERENT HORMONE THIS ORMON RE CALLING MELATONAN WILL BE RELEASED FROM YOUR PINEO GLAND SO THERE'S TWO MECHANISMS HERE AWAKEFULNESS SIGNAL AND A SLEEPINESS SIGNAL AND THE WAKEFULNESS SIGNAL TRIGGERS THE ONSET OF THE TIMER FOR THE SLEEPINESS SIGNAL NOW THAT SLEEPING THE SIGNAL THAT WE CALL MELATONAN THAT'S RELEASE FROM THE PINELE COMES ONLY FROM THE PINEL UNLESS YOUR TAKING EXOGINOUS MELATON AND YOUR SUPPLEMENTING WITH MELATONAN THE ONLY SOURCE OF MELATONAN IN YOUR BODY IS GOING TO BE THIS PINEO GLAND SO'S TALK ABOUT THE PINEO GLAND FOR A SECOND THE PINEO GLAND IS A GLAND THAT SITS CAN HAVE BEIN THE LITTLE STRUCTURE NEAR IF FOR THE EFPHICIONATOS OUT THERE IT'S CONING EAR THE FOURTH VENTRICOL IT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF A PE DECART THE PHILOSOPHER SAID THAT THE PINELE WAS THE SEAT OF THE SOUL HE SAID THAT BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE FEW STRUCTURES IN THE HUMAN BRAIN THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE OF THEM YOU KNOW MOST STRUCTURES AS ONE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BRAIN SO CALLED BIHEMISPHERIC BUT THE PINELERS ONLY ONE I DON'T KNOW ANTHING ABOUT SOULS REALLY AM CERTAINLY NOT THE SCIENCE OF SOULS BUT I THINK IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THO THE PINELS THE SEAT OF THE SOUL BUT IT IS A VERY INTERESTING ORGAN BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY ORGAN IN OUR BODY THAT RELEASES MELATONAN AND THAT MELATONAN MAKES US SLEEPY AND LETS US FALL ASLEEP NOW I'M GUESSING THAT MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY ASKING SHOULD I TAKE MELATONA MY PERSONAL BIAS ON THIS IS ECCEPT IN RARE CASES NO FOR THE FOLLOWING REASON MELATONAN HAS A SECOND FUNCTION WHICH IS THAT MELATONAN ALSO SUPPRESSES THE ONSET OF PUBERTY IN KIDS AND ESPECIALLY IN BABIES MELATONAN ISN'T JUST RELEASED IN THE EVENING TWELVE TO SIXTEEN HOURS AFTER WE WAKE MELATONAN IS RELEASED CHRONICALLY OR TONICALLY THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND NIGHT AND THAT CHRONIC OR TONIC RELEASE OF MELATONAN IS KNOWN TO SUPPRESSOME OF THE OTHER HORMONES IN OTHER REGIONS OF THE BRAIN THE TRIGGER THE ONSET OF PUBERTY NOW IF YOU ARE YOUR CHILD HAS BEEN TAKING MELATONAN DON'T FREEK OUT AS ALWAYS ANY KIND OF A SUPPLEMENT OR ANYTHING THAT YOUARE GOING TO TAKE OR THINK ABOUT TAKING YOU REALLY NEED TO CONSULT WITH YOUR DOCTOR I'VE SAID THIS MANY TIMES ON THIS PODCAST AND IT'S IN THE SHONOTES ET CETERA BUT BEFORE YOU REMOVE ANYTHING OR ADD ANYTHING TO WHAT OU'RE ALREADY DOING PLEASE DO CONSULT WITH A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL HOWEVER MELATONAN IS KNOWN TO SUPPRESS THE ONSET OF PUBERTY SO MUCH SO THAT REGULAR SICLIC CYCOLD PERIODS OF MELATONAN RELEASE FROM THE PINELE REALLY CORRELATE WITH THE ONSET OF PUBERTY AND EARLY ADULTHOOD MEANING AS WE START SECRE ING MELATONAN ONLY AT NIGHT THAT'S ALSO WHEN WE TRAN TO TRANSITION OUT OF PUBERITY NOW THER A LOT OF THINGS THAT CORRELATE IN OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM SO AT DOESN'T ASSOENLY MEAN IT CONTROLS IT BUT IN THIS CASE WE KNOW BASED ON LOTS OF DATA AND O CHRONOLOGY AND SO FORTH THAT MELATONAN SUPPRESSES THE ON SET OF PUBERITY SO SUPPLEMENTING MELATONAN COULD BE PROBLEMATIC FOR THAT REASON BUT IF YOU'RE  IF YOU'VE ALREADY GONE THROUGH PUBERITY IT COULD ALSO HAVE SON IMPACT ON OTHER HORMONE SYSTEMS IN YOUR BODY SO THAT'S WHY I PERSONALLY DON'T LIKE TO USE MELATONAN TO FALL ASLEEP THERE'S ANOTHER REASON WHICH IS THAT MELATONAN WILL HELP YOU FALL ASLEEP BUT IT WON'T HELP YOU STAY ASLEEP AND MANY PEOPLE WHO TAKE MELATONAND FIND THAT THEY WAKE UP THREE TO FIVE HOURS LATER UNABLE TO FALL BACK ASLEEP PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT MIGHT BE THAT MELATONAN PURCHASE AT YOU COMBIDE OVER THE COUNTER IN MOST AREAS OF THE WORLD EVEN THOUGH IT'S A HORMON WHICH LITTLE UNUSUAL YOU CAN'T JUST GO INTO A PHARMACEE AT LEAST IN THE UES AND BY TESTASTRONE OR CORTISALL OR ESTROGEN YOU NEED A PRESCRIPTION BUT YOU CAN GO BY MELATONAN FOR WHATEVER REASON I DON'T KNOW THE THE REASONS FOR THE THAT O LEGALITY BUT IT'S BEEN SHOWN MANY TIMES AND NOW I'M A BORROWING FROM SOME ITEMS THAT WERE IN MATWALKERS BOOK WHI WE SLEEP WHERE HE STATED THE THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT IN COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE MELATONAN THE AMOUNT OF MELATONAN HAS BEEN TESTED IN FOR VARIOUS BRANDS AND IT CAN RANGE ANYWHERE FROM TBEING FIFTEEN PER CENT OF WHAT'S LISTED ON THE BOTTLE HOCISO IF THEY LIST THIS IS A HUNDRED MELOGRAMS WOULD BE A TREMENDOUSLY HIDOS I TURNS OUT IT'S ONLY FIFTEEN MELOGRAMS IN THAT PARTICULAR PILLAR CAPSIL OR UP TO FOUR HUNDRED TIMES MORE THAN WHAT'S LISTED ON THE BOTTLE SO IT'S COMPLETELY UNREGULATED AND SO FOR THOSE OF YOU TAKING MELATONAN I WILL DISCUSSED THAT THE END OF THE PODCAST SOME OTHER POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE PROBABLY SAFER AND DON'T HAVE THESE ISSUES SO SHOULD YOU TAKE MELATONAN MIGHT PERSONAL BYUS IS KNOW BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE THEY FIND THAT IT DOES HELP THEM AND SO IF YOU DO FIND IT HELPS YOU THEN JUST CONSIDER WHAT I'M SAYING IN LIGHT OF THE OTHER PRACTICES THAT YOUR DOING AND TALK YOUR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL O CASO THE RHYTHM OF CORTISAL AND MELATONAN IS WHAT WE CALL IN DOGENOUS IT'S HAPPENING IN US ALL THE TIME WITHOUT ANY EXTERNAL IMPUT IN FACT IF WE WERE IN COMPLETE DARKNESS LIVING IN A CAVE WITH NO ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS WHATSOEVER OR WE WERE IN COMPLETE BRIGHTNESS WHERE WE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANY DARKNESS THESE RHYTHMS OF CORTESALL AND MELATONAN WOULD CONTINUE YOU WOULD HAVE A BUMPIN CORTISALL OR A PULSE IN CORTISALL THAT WOULD DROP OFF WITH TIME AND THEN MELATONAN WOULD COME UP ABOUT TWELVE TO FOURTEEN HOURS LATER BUT THESE INDOGENOUS SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY WHICH ARE BOTH HORMONAL AND NORAL WERE SET SO THAT EXTERNAL THINGS COULD GOVERN WHEN THEY HAPPEN NOW THIS TAKES US BACK TO E PISODE ONE OF THE PODCASTS THAT IF YOU  HAVEN'T LISTEN TO ALREADY YOU MIGHT WANT TO LISTEN TO WHERE WE TALKED ABOUT SENSATION AND PERCEPTION AND ALL THAT I'M NOT IN REVIEW IT AGAIN HERE BUT THERE'S ONE PARTICULAR CENSURY EVENT ONE PARTICULAR INFLUENCE ON YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT DETERMINES WHEN THAT CARTISALL IS GOING TO START TO RISE SO IF YOU WERE IN COMPLETE DARKNESS IT WOULD HAPPEN ONCE PER TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE BUT IT WOULD BE SOMEWHAT LATER AND LATER EACH DAY WHEREAS ON NORMA UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU WAKE UP AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU WAKE UP YOU OPEN YOUR EYES WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR EYES LIGHT COMES INTO YOUR ESES NOW THE WAY THIS SYSTEM WORKS IS THAT YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR SET OF NURONS IN YOUR EYE THEY'RE CALLED RETINAL GANGLIAN CELLS YOU DON'T HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BUT THESE RETINAL GANGLIN CELLS OR BRAIN NURONS AGAIN THE RETINA IS JUST THE ONE PIECE OF YOUR BRAIN ASHY TUPIECES CAUSE MOST OF YU HAVE TWO RETINAS THAT RESIDES OUTSIDE THE SKULL PERSAY WHEN LIGHT COMES INTO THE EYE THERE'S A PARTICULAR GROUP OF RETINAL GANGLIAN CELLS OR TYPE OF RETINAL GANGLIN CELLS THAT PERCEIVES A PARTICULAR TYPE OF LIGHT AND COMMUNICATES THAT TO THIS CLOCK THAT RESIDES RIGHT ABOVE THE REFOR YOUR MOUTH CALLED THE SUPERCISMATIC NUCLEUS  SO I KNOW THIS CAN GET LOW COMPLICATE BUT THESE RETINAL GANGLIN CELLS WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR EYES LIGHT COMES IN AND AN ELECTRICAL SIGNAL IS SENT TO THIS CENTRAL CLOCK WE CALL THE SUPERCAIOSMATIC NUCLEUS AND THA SUPERCISMATIC NUCLEUS HAS CONNECTIONS WITH ESSENTIALLY EVERY CELL IN ORGAN OF YOUR BODY NOW IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET LIGHT COMMUNICATED TO THIS CENTRAL CLOCK IN ORDER TO TIME THE CARTISAL AND MELOTONAN PROPERLY WHEN I SAY PROPERLY I CAN SAY THAT WITH CONFIDENCE BECAUSE WE KNOW BASED ON A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT IF YOU DON'T GET YOURE CARTESAL AND MELOTONAN RHYTHMS RIGHT NHERE ARE TREMENDOUSLY A BROAD AND BAD EFFECTS ON CARTEVASCULAR HEL DIMENSION METABOLIC EFFECTS LEARNING DEPRESSION DIMENSIA IN FACT THERE SO MANY NEGATIVE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH GETTING THIS WRONG THAT I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO IT INTOO MUCH DETAIL IN FACT I FEEL LIKE WE'VE BON BEEN BOMBARDED WITH ALL THIS INFORMATION ABOUT HOW WE'RE NOT SLEEPING WELL WERE NOT SLEEPING IN THE RIGHT TIMES WERE NOT SLEEPING ENOUGH TO THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE NOW HAVE SLEEP ANXIETY THEY THEY IFTHEY CAN'T SLEEP WELL FOR A NIGHT THEY ARE FEELING OVERWHELMED BY THAT AND SORT OF NOW THEYRE STRESSED ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO SLEEP WHICH IS MAKING HARDER TO SLEEP ET CETERA I REALLY WANT A FOCUS ON WHAT WE CAN DO TO ANCHOR THESE SYSTEMS PROPERLY S LET'S THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DO THIS CORRECTLY AND HOW TO DO IT CORRECTLY WHEN WE WAKE UP OUR EYES OPEN NOW IF WE'RE IN A DARK ROOM THERE ISN'T ENOUGH LIGHT TO TRIGGER THE CORRECT TIMING OF THIS CARTISALL MELATONAN THING TES RHYTHMS YOU MIGHT SELL WELL WHY WON'T ANY LIGHT DO IT WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT THESE NURONS IN OUR EYE THAT SET THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK AND THEN ALLOW OUR CRCADIAN CLOCK TO SET ALL THE CLOCKS OF ALL THE CELLS AND ORGANS AND TISSUES OF OUR BODY RESPONDS BEST TO A PARTICULAR QUALITY OF LIGHT AND A MOUNT OF LIGHT AND THOSE ARE THE QUALITIES OF LIGHT AND A MOUNT OF LIGHT THAT COME FROM SUNLIGHT SO THESE NURONS WHAT THEY'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR ALTHOUGH THEY DON'T HAVE A MIND OF THEIR OWN IS THE SUN AT WHAT WE CALL LOW SOLAR ANGLE THE IYE AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM DON'T NO ANYTHING ABOUT SUNRISES OR SUNSETS IT ONLY KNOWS THE QUALITY OF LIGHT THAT COMES IN WHEN THE SUN IS LOW IN THE SKY THE SYSTEM EVOLVED SO THAT WHEN THE SUN IS LOW IN THE SKYE THERE'S A PARTICULAR CONTRAST BETWEEN YELLOWS IN BLUES THAT TRIGGERS THE ACTIVATION OF THESE CELLS SO IF YOU WAKE UP AND YOU LOOK AT YOUR PHONE OR YOUR COMPUTER OR YOU FLIP ON A BUNCH OF ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS WILL THESE CELLS BE ACTIVATED AND THE ANSWER IS SORT OF THEY'LL BE ACTIVATED BUT NOT IN THE OPTIMAL WAY WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS GET SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYE AS CLOSE TO WAKING AS POSSIBLE NOW I WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT THIS CAUSE I'VE TALKED ABOUT AT ANOTHER PODCASTS WHEN I WAS A GUEST AND I'VE TALKED ABOUT IT ON MY INSTREGRAM FEED AND THERE SEEM TO BE THE SAME QUESTIONS COMING UP AGAIN AND AGAIN THESE NURONS DON'T KNOW SUNLIGHT PERSAY THEY DON'T KNOW SUNRIGHT RISE OR SUNSET FOR THAT MATTER THEY DON'T KNOW ARTIFICIAL LIGHT FROM SUNLIGHT WHAT THEY RESPOND BEST TO HOWEVER IS THE QUALITY AND A MOUNT OF LIGHT THAT COMES IN WHEN THE SUN IS LOW IN THE SKY THAT MEANS THAT IF YOU CAN WATCH THE SUNRISE GREAT THAT'S PERFECT FOR TRIGGERING ACTIVATION OF THESE CELLS HOWEVER IF YOU WAKE UP A FEW HOURS AFTER THE SUNRISE WHICH I TEN DO MOST DAYS PERSONALLY YOU STILL WANT TO GET OUTSIDE AND VIEW SUNLIGHT YOU DON'T NEED THE SUNLIGHT BEAMING YOU DIRECTLY IN THE EYE THERE'S A LOT OF PHAUTONS LIGHT ENERGY THAT SCATTERED FROM SUNLIGHT AT THE TIME BUT THE KEY IS TO GET THAT LIGHT ENERGY FROM SUNLIGHT IDEALLY INTO YOUR EYSE NOW I KDON'T MANY OF YOU ARE ALREADY ASKING WELL I LIVE IN SKIN AAVIA OR I CAN'T GET SUNLIGHTTHERE'S BUILDING IS AROUND ME ET CETERA WE WILL GET TO ALL OF THAT BUT IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU GET OUTSIDE TO GET THES LIGHT I TA DISCUSSION WITH A COLEAGUE OF MIND DOCTOR JAMIESEIZER WHOSE IN THE ADEPARTMENT PCYCHITRI AN BEHAVORAL SCIENCES THAT STAMFORD A WORLD EXPERT IN THIS AND HE TELLS ME THAT IT FIFTY TIMES LESS EFFECTIVE TO VIEW THE SUNLIGHT THROUGH WINDOW THROUGH A CAR WIND SHIELD OR THROUGH A SIDE WINDOW OF A CAR THEN IT IS TO JUST GET OUTSIDE WITH NO SUNLASSES AND VIEW LIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY NOW IF YOU CAN'T SEE THE SUNRISE LIKE A SAID YOU CAN SEE THIS WITHIN AN HOUR OR TWO OF SUNRISE BUT IT HAS TO BE LOW SOLAR ANGLE ONCE THE SUN IS OVERHEAD THE QUALITY OF LIGHT SHIFTS SO THA YOU MISS THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TIME THE CORTISALL PULSE AND THAT TURNS OUT TO BE A BAD THING TO DO YOU REALLY WANT A TIME THAT CORTISALL PULSE PROPERLY BECAUSE WELL GET INTO THIS ILOBIT MORE LATER BUT A LATE SHIFTED CARTISALL PULSE IN PARTICULAR IN NINE P M OR EIGHT P M INCREASEIN CORTISALL IS ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES AND MAYBE ONE OF THE CAUSES OF A LOT OF ANXIETY DISORDERS AND DEPRESSION SOIT'S KIND OF CHICKEN EGGTHING WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER NOT'S THE CORLAYED WITH IT'S THE CAUSE OR THE EFFECT BUT IT'S A SIGNATURE OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDER BRINGING THAT CORTISALL PULSE EARLIER IN YOUR WAKEFUL PERIOD EARLIER IN YOUR DAY HAS POSITIVE BENEFITS RANGING FROM BLOOD PRESSURE TO A MENTAL HEALTH ET CETERA NOT ENLIST THEM ALL OFFIS ARE JUST SO MANY OF THEM BUT MANY MANY PAUSIVE THINGS HAPPEN WHEN YOU ARE GETTING THE CARTISALL EARLY IN THE DAY FAR AWAY FROM YOUR MELOTONEIN PULSE OK SO HOW LONG SHOULD YOU BE OUTSIDE WELL THIS IS GOIN O VERY TREMENDOUSLY BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE LIVE IN ENVIRONMENTS WHERE IT'S VERY BRIGHT SO TIT SAY I IT'S COLORADO IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER THERE'S A SNOW FIELD THERE'S NO CLOUD COVERINGYOU WALK OUTSIDE YOU THERE'S GOING TO BE SO MUCH PHOTON LIGHT ENERGY ARRIVING ON YOUR RETNA THAT PROBABLY NLY TAKES THIRTY TO SIXTY SECONDS TO TRIGGER THE CENTRAL CLOCK AND SET YOUR CORTISALL AND MELOTONIAN RHYTHMS PROPERLY AND GET EVERYTHING IN A LIND UP NICELY WHEREAS IF YOU'RE IN SCANINAVIA IN THE DEPTHS OF WINTER AND YOU WAKE UP AT FIVE A M IN THE SUN IS JUST BARELY CREEPING ACROSS THE HORIZON THEN GOES BACK DOWN AGAIN A FEW HOURS LATER YOU PROBABLY ARE NOT GETTING ENOUGH SUNLIGHT IN ORDER TO SET THESE RHYTHMS SO MANY PEOPLE FIND THAT THEY NEED TO USE SUNLIGHT SIMULATORS IN THE FORM OF PARTICULAR LIGHTS THAT WERE DESIGNE TO SIMULATE SUNLIGHT HOWEVER I'M NOT OUT TO ATTACK THE COMPANIES THAT PRODUCE THOSE THERE'S ANOTHER SOLUTION TO THAT YOU CAN SIMPLY GO OUTSIDE FOR LONGER EVEN IF THERE'S A LOT OF DENSE CLOUD COVER YOU'RE PROBABLY GETTING ANYWHERE FROM TEN THOUSAND TO FIFTY THOUSAND LOCKS ELL U ACKS WHICH UST A MEASURE OF LIGHT ENERGY AND THAT SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO SET THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK YOU COULD SAY WELL THE LIGHTS IN MY HOUSE OR MY PHONE ARE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT RIGHT EVERYONE'S TELLING US TO STAY OFF OUR PHONES AT NIGHT BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY BRIGHT BETGUESS WHAT IT TURNS OUT THAT EARLY IN THE DAY YOUR RETNA IS NOT VERY SENSITIVE WHICH MEANS YOU NEED A LOT OF PHOTONS I DEALLY COMING FROM SUNLIGHT TO SET THESE CLOCK MECHANISMS SO LOOKING AT YOUR PHONEOR ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS IS FINE IF YOU WAKE UP BEFORE SUNRISE BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK TO SET THESE CLOCK MECHANISMS AND THIS IS SUPPORTED BY DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF QUALITY PUREREVIEWED STUDIES SO YOU WANTO UE SUNLIGHT IF YOU CAN'T SEE SUNLIGHT BECAUSE OF YOUR ENVIRONMENT THEN YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO OPPT FOR ARTIFICIAL LIGHT AND IN THAT CASE YOU'RE GOING TO WANT AN ARTIFICIAL LIGHT THAT ITHER SIMULATE SUNLIGHT OR HAS A LOT OF BLUE LIGHT NOW WITHOUT GOING OFF COURSE HERE YOU MIGHT BE SAYING WAIT I'VE HEARD BLUE LIGHT IS BAD FOR ME ACTUALLY BLUE LIGHT IS GREAT FOR THIS MECHANISM DURING THE DAY WE CAN TALK ABOUT BLUE LIGHT AND BLUE BLOCKERS BUT IT YOU REALLY WANT A LOT OF BLUE AND YELLOW LIGHT ARRIVING ON THE RETNA EARLY IN THE DAY LET ME BE CLEAR ABOUT SOMETHING YOU NEVER EVER WANT TO LOOK AT ANY LIGHT SUNLIGHT OR ARTIFICIAL LIGHT THAT IS PAINFUL TO LOOK AT IF YOU FIND THAT YOUR EYES OR WATERING OR HAVING CHALLENGES A MAINTAINING A YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THIS THING FOR A WHILE BECAUSE IS PAINFUL THAT LIGHT IS TOO BRIGHT AND YOU DO NOT WANT TA DAMAGE OUR RETNA SO YOU DON'T WANT TO GAZE AT THE SUN YOU REFUSING TO BLINK AND BURN YOUR RETNA THAT'S ACTUALLY POSSIBLE TO DO YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT YOU HAVE A PROPER BLINK REFLEC INSTALLED IN YOU SINCE BIRTH AND IF YOU FEEL LIKE SOMETHINGS TOO BRIGHT IN YOU NEED TO BLINK IT MEANS YOU NEED TO BLINK THAT IS TOO MUCH TOO MUCH LIGHT SO PLEASE DON'T BEAM YOUR EYES WITH REALLY BRIGHT LIGHT BUT BLUE LIGHT IN PARTICULAR BLUE LIGHT AND YELLOW LIGHT COMING FROM SUNLIGHT IS IDEAL IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT FROM ARTIFICIAL LIGHT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET ENOUGH SUNLIGHT WELL THEN ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS THAT ARE RICH IN BLUE BLUE WAVE LENGTHS ARE GOING TO BE IDEAL FOR SETTING THIS MECHANISM LOT OF PEOPLE SAY OH I SHOULD BE WEARING BLUE BLOCKERS THROUGHOUT THE DAY NO THAT'S THE EXACT WRONG THING YOU IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE BLUE BLOCKERS WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT THAT SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR LATE IN THE EVENING BECAUSE LIGHT SUPPRESSES MELATONAN I'VE BEEN ASKED MANY TIMES BEFORE ABOUT THIS PINEAL GLAND AND AM THEY'RE LOT OF ANCIENT PRACTICES THAT MAP TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I'M SAYING AN PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY OH I HEARD THAT SUNLIGHT IS GREAT FOR THE PINEAL WELL PERHAPS BUT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT PHRASE SUNLIGHT INHIBITS THE PINEL IT PREVENTS IT FROM RELEASING MELATONAN DARKNESS ALLOWS THE PINEEL TO RELEASE MELATONAN SO THE PINEAL IS NOT THE GLAND OR THE ORGAN OF SUNLIGHT IT IS THE GLAND OF DARKNESS IN FACT MELATONAN CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS A SLEEPINESS SIGNAL THAT'S CORRELATED WITH DARKNESS SO GET UP EACH MORNING TRY AND GET OUTSIDE I KNOW THAT CAN BE CHALLENGING FOR PEOPLE BUT ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO TEN MINUTES OF SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE IT'S GOING TO WORK WELL FOR MOST PEOPLE AND YOU WANT TO DO THIS ON A REGULAR BASIS AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT EXACTLY AT SUNRISE I REALIZE O'M REPEATING MYSELF BUT SOMEHOW DESPITE BARKING AT PEOPLE ABOUT THIS FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW I KEEP GETTING THE SAME QUESTIONS AND SOMEHOW IT HASN'T BEEN SINKING IN UM WHICH COULD BE RELATED TO SOME CIRCATIAN DISORDER I'M JUST KITTING IF IT'S NOT SINKING IN UTES PROBABLY THAT I'M NOT BEING EFFECTIVE IN COMMUNICATING THE INFORMATION BUT GET THAT BRIGHT LIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY FROM SUNLIGHT AND IF YOU CAN'T GET IT FROM SUNLIGHT GET IT FROM ARTIFICIAL LIGHT WHAT KINDS OF ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS WILL WORK WELL THERE ARE THE SUNLIHT SUNRISE SIMULATORS BUT THE RING LIGHTS THAT PEOPLE USE FOR UM A SELFIES AND THIS SORT OF THING A FOR POST NG ON INSTERGREM THOSE GENERATE A LOT OF BLUE LIGHT IF YOU WANT TO GET EXPERIMENTAL ABOUT THIS THERE'S A FREE AP I HAVE NO RELATIONSHIP TO THE AP BUT IT'S A GREAT AP CALLED LIGHT METER THAT YOU CAN USE YOUR PHONE AND YOU CAN MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF PHOTON ENERGY IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT ANS C AVE A FUN EXPERIMENT TO DO YOU CAN GO OUTSIDE IN THE MORNING AND YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE'S TEN THOUSAND TWENTY THOUSAND LUCKS EVEN THOUGH YIT MIGHT SEEM LIKE ITS KIND OF DIM OR THERE'S TREE COVER OR CLOUD COVER YOU GO INSIDE AND YOU SHINE THAT A THAT O AN ARTIFICIAL LIGHTAT YOUR PHONE PRESS THE BUTTON ON LIGHT METER AND OU'LL FIND THATIT'S ONLY FIVE HUNDRED OR A THOUSAND LOCKS AND YOU REALIZE THAT EVEN THOUGH IT SEEMS REALLY BRIGHT THE ARTIFICIAL LIGHT IS VERY CONDENSED WHEREAS THE OUTSIDE LIGHT IS SCATTERED IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND SO YOU CAN THINK THAT YOU'RE NOT GETTING MUCH SUNLIGHT EYEUR ACTHLY GETTING MUCH MORE OUTSIDE SO GET OUTSIDE GET THAT SUNLIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY AND TRY AND DO IT ON A CONSISTENT BASIS IF YOU CAN'T DO IT EVERY DAY OR YOU SLEEP THROUGH THIS PERIOD OF THE EARLY DAY LOW SOLAR ANGLE DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT THE SYSTEMS IN THE BODY THESE HORMON SYSTEMS AND ARRO TRANSMITTER SYSTEMS THAT MAKE YOU AWAKE AT CERTAIN PERIODS OF THE DAY AND SLEEPY AT OTHER TIMES ARE OPERATING BY AVERAGING WHEN YOU VIEW THE BRIGHTEST LIGHT NOW THAT CAN IMMEDIATELY TELL US THAT WHAT MOST PEOPLE ARE DOING AS TERRIBLE THEY'RE WAKING UP IN THEIR LOOKING AT THEIR PHONE WHICH ISN'T TRIGGERING ACTIVATION OF THESE SELLS IN THE EYE IN THE CENTRAL CIRCADIAN CLOCK THEN A YOU HOURS LATER THEY MIGHT GET IN THEIR CAR WITH SUN GLASSES IN DROT NOW A NOTE ABOUT SUNGLASSES AND PERSCRIPTION LENDSES ABSOLUTELY NEVER EVER EVER COMPROMISE SAFETY FOR THE SORTS OF THINGS I'M TALKING ABOUT SO IF YOU NEED TOWERE SUNGLASSES FOR SAFETY REASONS WEAR THEM ABSOLUTELY IF YOU WEAR PERSCRIPTION LENSES OR CONTACTS WEAR THEM THEY WON'T FILTER OUT THE WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR SETTING THESE CENTRAL CLOCKS SO SAFETY FIRST OF COURSE IF YOU HAVE A RETINAL DEGENERATIVE DISORDER REDNIGHT IS PIGMENTOSA MACULAR DEGENERATION OR GLAUCOMA OR THOSE RUN IN YOUR FAMILY YOU WANT TO AVOID EXCESSIVELY BRIGHT LIGHT ALL THE TIME YOU WANT TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO GET YOU'RE LIGHT EXPOSURE BY THROUGH SEEING DIMMER LIGHT INCLUDING SUNLIGHT BUT FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME PERHAPS YOU MIGHT IMMEDIATELY ASK WHAT ABOUT LOW VISION OR BLIND PEOPLE HOW TO THEY SET THESE CENTRAL CLOCKS WELL TURNS OUT THAT LOW VISION AND BLIND PEOPLES MOST OF THEM PROVIDED THEY STILL HAVE EYES THAT THE EYES WERN'T REMOVED BECAUSE OF A BURN OR TUMOR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT STILL MAINTAIN THESE NURONS THAT SET THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK WHICH BRINGS ME TO A REALLY IMPORTANT PORTANT POINT IT'S NOT ABOUT SEEN AND PERCEIVING THE SUN THIS IS A SUBCONSCIOUS MECHANISM BY WHICH THESE NURONS WHICH ARE CALLED MELINOPS IN GANGLIAN CELLS THESE NURONS SET YOUR CENTRAL CLOCKS BY GETTING ACTIVEATED BY THE PARTICULAR WAVELINGS OF LIGHT THAT ARE PRESENT IN THE ATMOSPHERE EVEN COMING THROUGH CLOUD COVER AND YOU DON'T NEED TO SEE OR PERCEIVE THE SUN IN ORDER TO GET THIS MECHANISM TO START NOW IT'S SUCH A VITALY IM POURED MECHANISM BECAUSE IT DICTATES HOW WELL AND WHAT TIME YOU WILL WANT TO FALL ASLEEP LATER IN THE DAY SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE NIGHT OWLS AND YOU INSIST THAT YOURE NIGHT OWL AND YOU HAVE THE GENETIC POLLYMORPHISM THAT MAKES YOUR NIGHT OWL YOU MAY VERY WELL HAVE THAT JUNETIC POLLYMORPHISM THOSE GENES THAT MAKE YOU WANT TO STAY UP LAKE AND WAKE UP LATE BUT CHANCES ARE ABOUT HALF OF YOU THAT THINK THAT YOUR NIGHT OWLS ARE JUST NOT GETTING ENOUGH SUNLIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY SO VIEWING LIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY IDEALLY SUNLIGHT IS KEY FOR ESTABLISHING HEALTHY SLEEP WAKE RHYTHMS AND FOR ALLOWING YOU TO FALL ASLEEP EASILY AT NIGHT NWIT'S NOT KIN TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THAT HAPPENS EVERY SINGLE TIME BUT IT IS THE FOUNDATION OF PROPER SLEEP AND WHAT WE CALL CIRCATY IN HEALTH IT GOVERNS METABOLISM AN SO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO EXIST ON A REGULAR TWENTY FOR HOURS CYCLE SOME OF YOU MANY OF YOU MIGHT BE ASKING WHAT ELSE CAN HELP SET THIS RHYTHM WHAT TURNS OUT THAT LIGHT IS WHAT WE CALL THE PRIMARY ZIHTE GIVER THE TIMEGIVER BUT OTHER THINGS CAN HELP ESTABLISH THE RHYTHM OF CORTIS ALL FOLLOWED BY MELOTONEAN TWELVE TO SIXTEEN HOURS LATER AS WELL THE OTHER THINGS BESIDES LIGHT ARE TIMING OF FOOD INTAKE TIMING OF EXERCISE AS WELL AS VARIES DRUGS OR CHEMICALS THAT ONE MIGHT IN JEST NOT E LEGAL DRUGS ALTHOUGH THOSE WILLIN PACK CIRCATING MECHANISMS AS WELL BUT THE REASON WE FOCUS SO HEAVILY ON LIGHT IS THAT LIGHT IS THE MAIN WAY THAT THE ECENTRAL CLOCK THE SUPERCASMATIC NUCLEUS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SET WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY DIRECT IMPUT TO THE CLOCK THESE NURONS IN THE EYE THAT ARE ALSO PART OF THE BRAIN THAT WE CALL MELONOPS AND GANGLIAN CELLS THAT NOT SO INCIDENTALLY WERE DISCOVERED BY MY FRIEND AND COLLIGUE DAVID BURSEN AT BROWN UNIVERSITY AND OTHERS SAMERHOTAR KING WYOU AT CETERA WORKED OUT THE MECHANISMS THE MOLECULAR MECHAM BUT IT WAS REALLY DAVID BERSEN THAT DISCOVERED THESE INCREDIBLY FASCINATING NONS YOU KNOW THESE ARE CELLS THAT AREN'T IMPORTANT FOR SIGHT LIKE PATTERN VISION BUT ARE FIRST SETTING OUR CLOCKS DAVID'S REALLY CREDITED WITH MAKING THAT DISCOVERY THOSE CELLS ARE THE MAIN WAY AND THE ONLY DIRECT WAY TO SET THE CLOCK IN FACT IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT LIGHT VIEWED BY THESE MELONOPS AND CELLS PARTICULAR SUNLIGHT IS A THOUSAND TO TEN THOUSAND TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE THEN SAY GETTING UP IN DARKNESS AND JUST EXERCISING THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU SHOULDN' EXERCISE EARLY IN THE DAY IN DARKNESS IF THAT'S WHAT YOU LIKE TO DO IT WILL HAVE SOMEWHAT AN EFFECT ON RAISING YOUR WAKEFULNESS EARLY IN THE DAY AND SETTING THIS THESE RHYTHMS AND THIS IS BECAUSE OF SOME OTHER PATHWAYS FOR THE OFFICIONATOS OUT THERE WANTED NO MORE NERAL SCIENCE HERE'S HOW IT GOES YOU'VE GOT THE CLOCK ABOVE THE ROOFO YOUR MOUTH THAT CHURNS OUTH THATS TWENTY FOUR HOUR RHYTHM AND IS COMMUNICATED TO AL L THE OTHER ORGANS AND TISSUES OF YOUR BODY BUT THERE'S ANOTHER STRUCTURE HAS A COOL NAME IT'S CALLED THE INTERGUNICULATE LEEFLET WHICH SITS A FEW MILIMETERS AWAY IN THE BRAIN AND IT'S INVOLVED IN REGULATING THE CLOCK OUTPUT THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED NONPHOTIC NON LIGHT TYPE INFLUENCES LIKE EXERCISE AND FEEDING ET CETERA SO IF YOU ARE NOT FEELING AWAKE DURING THE DAY IN YOUR HAVING TROUBLE SLEEPING GET THE SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE THAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT IF YOU WANT TO BECOME AN EARLY RIZER FOR INSTANCE AND YOU WANT A FEEL MORE AWAKE DURING THE A EARLY PART OF THE DAY BY GETTING THAT LIGHT EXPOSURE AND EXERCISING EARLY IN THE DAY YOU WILL AFTER TWO OR THREE DAYS YOU WILL NATURALLY START AWAKE UP EARLIER IN THE DAY AND THAT'S BECAUSE THESE CLOCK MECHANISMS HAVE SHIFTED IT'S LIKE SETTING THE CLOCK EARLIER AS OPPOSED TO DELAYING THE CLOCK AND THAT TAKES US TO A SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED BUT VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT TO ALL THIS WHICH IS WHAT SETS THE CLOCK AND KEEPS IT ANCHORED THE MAIN THING IS THAT BRIGHT LIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY THE OTHER THING IS SUNSET WHEN THE SUN IS ALSO AT THOUG SOLAR ANGLE LOW CLOSE TO THE HORIZON BY VIEWING SUNLIGHT AT THAT TIME O DAY IN THE EVENING OR AFTERNOON DEPENDING ON WHAT TIME A YEAR IT IS AND WHERE YOU ARE IN THE WORLD THESE MELONOPSEN SELLS THESE NORONS IN YOUR EYES SIGNAL THE CENTRAL CIRCADEAN CLOCK THAT IT'S THE END OF THE DAY AND THEREIS A REALLY NICE STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHED LAST YEAR AND I WILL PUT LINKS TO THESE REFERENCES ON A WEBSIHE NOT TOO LONG FROM NOW THERE IS A REALLY NICE STUDY THAT SHOWED THAT VIEWING SUNLIGHT AROUND THE TIME OF THE SUN SET DOESN'T HAVE TO BE JUST CROSSING THE HORIZON BUT CIRCUS SUNSET WITHIN AN HOUR OR SO OF SUNSET PREVENTS SUME OF THE BAD EFFECTS OF LIGHT IN PREVENTING MELOTONE AN RELEASE LATER THAT SAME NIGHT SO LET ME REPEAT THIS VIEWING LIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY AS KEY VIEWING LIGHT LATER IN THE DAY WHEN THE SUN IS SETTING OR AROUND THAT TIME CAN HELP PROTECT THESE MECHANISMS YOUR BRAIN AND BODY AGAINST THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF LIGHT LATER IN THE DAY SO LET ME TALK ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD DO THAT YOU'D GO VIEW THE SUNSET OR YOU WOULD GO OUTSIDE IN THE LATE AFTERNOON OR EVENING AGAIN IF YOU SAFELY CAN DO THAT WITH SUNGLASSES OFF YOU WILL F YOU NEED WERE SON GLASS IS FINE BUT IT WILL TAKE PROBABLY A HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND TIMES LONGER WITH DARK SUN GLASSES THAN IF YOU TAKE THEM OFF AGAIN IF YOU UN DO THIS THROUGH A WINDOW AT WORK THAT'S FINE BUT ILL TAKE FIFTY TIMES LONGER SO THE BEST THING TO DO IS JUST TO GET OUTSIDE FOR A FEW MINUTES ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO TEN MINUTES ALSO IN THE AFTERNOON HAVING THOSE TWO SIGNALS ARRIVING TO YOUR CENTRAL CLOCK THAT YOUR BODY YOUR INTERNAL WORLD KNOWS WHEN ITS MORNING AND KNOWS WEDNE EVENING IS TREMENDOUSLY POWERFUL MAYBE THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY EVERY SELLING YOUR BODY NEEDS GLUECOST AND ENERGY IT NEEDS WHETHER NOT GETS THAT FROM METOR IT GETS IT FROM KEYTONES OR IT GETS IT FROM CARBOHYDRATES OR FRUIT VEGETABLES DOESN'T MATTER IT IS EVENTUALLY CONVERTED INTO A CERTAIN FORM OF ENERGY THAT ALL YOUR CELLS YUSE BUT YOU DON'T TAKE GLUCOS YOU DON'T TAKE  BREAD OR A STAKE OR NOIC'S ORANGE AND SHOVEIT ING YOUR EAR YOU PUTTING YOUR MOUTH THAT GOES IN YOUR STOMACH IT'S DIGESTED AND THAN THAT IT THAT RESOURCES DISTRIBUTED TO ALL THE CELLS OF YOUR BODY EVERY CELL IN YOUR BODY NEEDS OXYGEN AND YOU DON'T PUT A HOSE YOU KNOW THROUGH YOUR NOSTRIL OR THROUGH YOUR EAR OR THROUGH SOME OTHER ORIFICE IN YOUR BODY YOU INHALE AIRE AND IT'S THEN DISTRIBUTED VI THE LUNGS TO THE CELLS A IN YOUR BLOOD STREAM IN THAT'S DISTRIBUTE TO ALL THE ORGANS OF YOUR BODY EVERY CELL AND ORGAN IN YOUR BODY NEEDS LIGHT INFORMATION AND THE WAY TO GET THAT LIGHT INFORMATION TO ALL THOSE CELLS BECAUSE YOU HAVE A THICK SKULL AND DART YOU KNOW INSIDE OF YOU IS DARK INSIDE YOUR SKIN THERE'S NO SUNLIGHT GETTING IN THERE IS BY VIEWING SUNLIGHT WITH YOUR EYES AT THE TWO TIMES A DAY THAT I'M REFERRING TO HAD THAT'S THE ONLY ROUT THERE WAS A STUDY PUBLISHED IN SCIENCE AND EXCELLENT JOURNAL A WELL OVER A TEN YEARS AGO THAT SHOWED THAT LIGHT SHOWN ON THE BACK OF THE KNEE COULD SET THESE THE CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS THAT STUDY WAS RETRACTED AND UNFORTUNATELY MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT IT WAS RETRACTED THERE WERE SOME EXPERIMENTAL FLAWS THAT PEOPLE ERE ACTUALLY VIEWING LIGHT THROUGH YOUR EYES THAT STUDY WAS REPEATED TURNS OUT THERE IS NO EXTRA OCULAR PHOTO RECEPTION IN HUMANS WHATEVER SOMEBODY TELLS YOU THAT LIGHT TO THE SKIN OR LIGHT TO THE WHEREVER IS BENEFICIAL FOR YOUR HEALTH WE TALK ABOUT THAT BUT THEREIS NO WAY THAT LIGHT INFORMATION IS SETTING YOUR CLOCKS YOU NEED THESE CELLS IN YOUR EYES TO PERCEIVE WERE A TO SEE LIGHT AT THE PARTICULAR TIMES A DAY THAT I'M REFERRING TO SOME ANIMALS LIKE SNAKES AND OTHER REPTILES ACTULLY HAVE A HOLE IN THE TOP OF THEIR SKULL TO GET LIGHT INFORMATION DIRECTLY TO THEIR PINEAL WHERE TO SUPPRESS MELATONAN WE DON'T HAVE THAT WHOLE EMMAN MOST OF YOU DON'T HAVE HOLES IN YOUR SKULL THESE HOLLS IN YOUR SKULL THAT WE CALL THE SOCKETS FOR THE EYES ARE ACTUALLY THERE PRIMARILY TO ALLOWLIGHT INFORMATION TO THE CENTRAL CLOCK AND THEN VISION AND PATTERN VISION IND COLORVISION CAME MUCH LATER IN EVOLUTION WE KNOW THIS ON THE BASIS OF GENETIC STUDIES WE GET DISCUSSING A FUTURE PODCAST SO GET THAT LIGHT INFORMATION TO THE CELLS OF YOUR BRAIN AND BODY BY VIEWING SUNLIGHT AT THE TWO TIMES A DAY THAT I REFERRED TO THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW LONG HOW MUCH HOW DO I KNOW IF I'VE HAD ENOUGH YOU'LL KNOW BECAUSE YOUR RHYTHM WILL START TO FALL INTO SOME DEGREE OF NORMAL SY YOU'LL START TO WAKE UP AT MORE OR LESS THE SAME TIME EACH DAY YOU'LL FALL ASLEEP MORE EASILY AT NIGHT GENERALLY IT TAKES ABOUT TWO OR THREE DAYS FOR THESE SYSTEMS TO A LINE SO IF YOU'VE NOT BEEN DOING THESE BEHAVIORS IT'S GOING TO TAKE A FEW DAYS BUT THEY CAN HAVE TREMENDOUS BENEFITS AND SOMETIMES RATHER QUICKLY ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MENTAL AND PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF YOUR HEALTH NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BAD EFFECTS OF LIGHT BECAUSE LIGHT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO ARRIVE IN OUR SYSTEM AT ANY TIME AND NOWADAYS BECAUSE OF SCREENS AND ARTIFICIAL LIGHT WE HAVE ACCESS TO LIGHT AT TIMES OF DAY AND NIGHT THAT NORMALLY WE WOULDN'T NOW EARLIER I SAID THAT YOU NEED A LOT OF LIGHT IN PARTICULAR SUNLIGHT TO SET THESE CLOCK MECHANISMS THAT'S TRUE BUT THERE'S A KIND OF DIABOLICAL FEATURE TO THE WAY ALL THIS WORKS WHICH IS THE LONGER YOU'VE BEEN AWAKE THE MORE SENSITIVE YOUR RETINA AND THESE CELLS ARE TO LIGHT SO THAT IF YOU'VE BEEN AWAKE FOR TEN TWELVE FOURTEEN HOURS IT BECOMES VERY EASY FOR EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT OF LIGHT COMING FROM A SCREEN OR FROM AN OVERHEAD LIGHT TO TRIGGER THE ACTIVATION OF THE CLOCK AND MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WANT A STAY UP LATER MAKE IT HARDER TO FALL ASLEEP AND DISRUPT YOUR SLEEP PATTERN MOCHISO THE SIMPLE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS YOU WANT AS MUCH LIGHT AS AS SAFELY POSSIBLE EARLY IN THE DAY MORNING AND THROUGHOUT THE DAY INCLUDING BLUE LIGHT SO TAKE THOSE BLUE BLOCKERS OFF DURING THE DAY UNLESS YOU HAVE A REAL ISSUE WITH SCREENLIGHT SENSITIVITY AND YOU WANT AS LITTLE LIGHT COMING INTO YOUR EYES ARTIFICIAL OR SUNLIGHT AFTER SAY EIGHT P M AND CERTAINLY YOU DO NOT WANT TO GET BRIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE TO YOUR EYES BETWEN ELEVEN P M AND FOR I M AND HERE'S WHY DAVID BURSON WHO I MENTION BEFORE AND ANOTHER FRIEND IN COLLEAGUE SAMMERHOTAR WHOSE DIRECTOR OF THE CHRONOBIOLOGY UNIT AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF MENTAL HEALTH PUBLISH A PAPER IN SELL WHICH IS A JOURNAL ANOTHER EXCELLENT JOURNAL VERY HIGHSTRINGENCY SHOWING THAT LIGHT THAT ARRIVES TO THE EYES BETWEEN ELEVEN P M AND FOR A M APPROXIMATELY SUPPRESSES THE RELEASE OF DOPOMINE THIS NORMOGELAER THAT MAKES US FEEL GOOD AS SORT OF AN ANT INDOGENOUS ANTIS SUPA DEPRESSENT AND CAN INHIBIT LEARNING AND CREATE ALL SORTS OF OTHER DETRIMENTAL EFFACTS IT DOES THIS THROUGH A MECHANISM FOR THOSE OF YOU WANT A NOW THE NERL PATHWAYS THAT INVOLVES LIGHT TO THE EYES THAT'S THEN SIGNAL TO A STRUCTURE CALLED THE HABENULA THEY LET THE HOBENIA LOOKS LIKE TOO LITTLE BAT EARS SITTING RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF YOU STRUCTION YOU BRING CALL THE FHALEMUS DON'T WORRY ABOUT THESE NAMES IF YOU'RE NOT INTEREST IN THE STUFF IF YOU ARE TIS YOU JUST AVENUES TO EXPLORE WHEN THAT HOBENIALA GETS ACTIVATED IT'S ACTUALLY CALLED THE DISAPPOINTMENT NEWCLEUS BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY MAKES US FEEL LESS HAPPY AND MORE DISAPPOINTED AND CAN LEAD TO CERTAIN FORMS OF DEPRESSION IN THE WAKEFUL STATE NOW IF YOU WAKE UP THE MILL THE NIANENIANS USE THE BATHRUMER YOU'RE ON AND ALL NIGHT FLIGHT IN YOUR A YOU KNOW YOURE NEED TO READ OR WHATEVER IT IS FINE TAT'S YOU KNOW EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE IT'S NOT TO BE A PROBLEM TO GET BRIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE TO YOUR EYES IN THE MILLTHE NIGHT BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT OUR LIFESTYLE NOWADAYS AND BEING UP LATE LOOKING AT PHONES EVEN IF YOU DIM THAT SCREEN YOU'RE TRIGGERING THIS ACTIVATION BECAUSE YOUR RETINAL SENSITIVITY IN THE SENSITIVITY OF THESE NURONS HAS GONE UP LATE IN THE DAY NOW I'M NOT HERE TO DICTATE WHAT YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T DO BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE EXPERIENCING CHALLENGES WITH MOOD THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE ANXIETY LEARNING PROBLEMS ISSUES FOCUSSING THE QUESTIONS I USUALLY GETT ER HOW CAN I FOCUS BETTER WELL WE WILL GET TO THAT BUT ONE OF THE BEST WAYS YOU CAN SUPPORT YOUR MECHANISMS FOR GOOD MOOD MENTAL HEALTH LEARNING FOCUS METABOLISM ET CETERA IS TO TAKE CONTROL OF THIS LIGHT EXPOSURE BEHAVIOR AT NIGHT AND NOT GET MUCH OR ANY BRIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE THE MILL THE NIGHT RED LIGHT WON'T TRIGGER THIS PATHWAY BUT VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE THE KIND OF IMFRED LIGHTS THAT ARE SET UP OR FLOOR LIGHTS THAT BRINGS ME TO AN IMPORTANT POINT WHICH IS ABOUT THE LOCATION OF LIGHT THIS HASN'T BEEN DISCUSSED MUCH OUT THERE I DON'T THINK THESE CELLS IN OUR EYE THESE NURONS THAT SIGNAL THE CENTRAL CLOCK RESIDE MOSTLY NOT EXCLUSIVELY BUT MOSTLY IN THE BOTTOM HALF OF OUR RETINA AND BECAUSE WE HAVE A LENS IN FRONT OF OUR RETNA AND BECAUSE OF THE OPTICS OF LENSES THAT MEANS THAT THESE CELLS ARE ACTUALLY VIEWING OUR UPPER VISUAL FEEL THERE'S AN INVERSION OF THE VISUAL IMAGE ET CETERA YOU CAN LOOK THAT UP IF YOU WANT IT LEARN MORE ABOUT A RETINALOPTICS IT'S FASCINATING BUT NOT THE TOPIC FOR TO DAY THE CELLSARE IN THE BOTTOM HALF OF YOUR RETINA MOSTLY AND SO THEI'RE VIEWING THE OVERHEAD VISUAL SPASE AROUND YOU THIS IS PROBABLY NOT COINCIDENTAL THAT A THESE CELLS WERE ESSENTIALLY DESIGN TO DETECT SUNLIGHT WHICH IS OVERHEAD OF COURSE SO IF YOU WANT TO AVOID IMPROPER ACTIVATION OF THESE NORONS IT'S BETTER TO PLACE LIGHTS THAT YOU USE IN THE EVENING LOW IN YOUR PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT SO ON DEST TOPS OR EVEN THE FLOOR IF THAT'S IF YOU WANT TO GO THAT WAY AS OPPOSED TO OVERHEAD LIGHTS SO OVERHEAD FLORESCENT LIGHTS WOULD BE THE WORST THAT WOULD BE THE WORST CASE CYNARIO LIGHTS THAT ARE OVERHEAD THAT ARE A LOBIT SOFTER OF THE OR YELLOW OR REDDISH TINTS WOULD BE SLIGHTLY BETTER BUT DIM LIGHTS THAT ARE SET LOW IN THE ROOM ARE GOING TO BE BEST BECAUSE THEY AREN'T GOING TO ACTIVATE THESE NURONS AND THEREFORE SHIFT YOUR CIRCADYAN CLOCK SO THAT'S A GOAL SOME PEOPLE LIKE SAMMER THE HATARS I MENTION EARLY ARE HE TURNS THIS HOME BASICALLY INTO A CAVE IN THE EVENINGS CANDLE LIGHT ACTUALLY DOES NOT TRIGGER ACTIVATION OF THESE CELLS SO CANDLE LIGHT AND FIREPLACES AND A CAMP FIRES ARE ARE FINE O DIM LIGHTS VERY DIM LIGHTS ARE FINE AND LIGHTS LOW IN THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT OF COURSE THE PROMLA CANDLE LIGHT AND FIRE PLACES IS THE FIRE HAZARD BUT YOUR SMART PEOPLE YOU YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT THAT DON'T BURN DOWN WHATEVER STRUCTURE YOU'RE IN INCLUDING FOREST PLEASE SO KEEP THE LIGHTS LOW IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT WHAT IF YOU WAKE UP THE MILL THE NIGHT AND YOU FIND YOURSELF WATCHING TEEVY OR ON THE COMPUTER AND WELL IN THAT CASE YOU MIGHT WANT AWARE BLUE BLOCKERS AND YOU CERTAINLY WOULD WANT A DIM THE SCREEN BUT I DEAL YOU 'RE NOT DOING THAT IT'S REMARKABLE THE POSIVE EFFECTS OF GETTING THAT BIT OF SUNLIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY MAYBE EVEN ALSO ROUND SUNSET AND AVOIDING BRIGHT LIGHTS AND ESPECIALLY OVER HEAD BRIGHT LIGHTS BETWEEN BOUT ELEVEN P M AND FOR I M NOW I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SHIFT WORK REALIZING THAT WE'RE PROLEGAN TO HAVE TO HAVE AN ENTIRE DISCUSSION DEVOTED JUST TO SHIFT WORKERS BECAUSE THERERE SOME GOOD INFORMATION THEREABOUT HOW THEY CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST SOME OF THE VERY BAD HEALTH OFFACTS OF SHIFT WORK GETTING LIGHT THE MILL THE NIGHT BUT WE RELY ON SHIFT WORKERS AND THEI'R SUPERIMPORTANT TO CULTURE AND SOCIETY IN THE ECONOMY SO I WANT ACKNOWLEDGE THEM AND LET YOU KNOW THAT WE WILL DO A A DISCUSSION ABOUT SHIFT WORK AND JET LAG BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT LIGHT CAN DO IN TERMS OF SHIFTING US IN HEALTHY WAYS SO THE WAY TO THING ABOUT THIS WHOLE SYSTEM AGAIN AS YOU'VE GOT A DENIZINE BUILDING UP DEPENDING ON HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN AWAKE AND IT'S MAKING YOU SLEEPY AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE CIRCADIAN MECHANISMS THAT ARE TIMING YOUR WAKEFULNESS AND TIMING WHEN YOU WANT O BE ASLEEP MAINLY THROUGH CARTIS ALL AND MELOTONAN BUT THERE ARE BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS THAT ARE DOWN STREAM OF QUARTIS ALL MELOTONEAND LIKE WE TEND TO BE HUNGRIER DURING OUR WAKEFUL PERIOD THEN LATE AT NIGHT SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO EAT AT LATE AT NIGHT BUT IF YOU'RE FINDING THAT YOU CAN'T BECOME A DAY PERSON OR MORNING PERSON SHIFTING YOUR LIGHT EXPOSURE EXERCISE AND FOOD IN TAKE TO THE DAYTIME WILL HELP SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO STOP EATING AROUND SIX OR EIGHT P M BECAUSE OF MMETABOLIC REASONS OR THEIR CHINE TO MAINTAIN THEIR WAIHT OR LOOSE WAIGHT THAT'S ISHALLY NOT SUPPORTED SO WELL BY THE LITERATURE THE LITERATURE ROUND NUTRITION ASSENTIALY SAYS THAT IT'S BEST TO RESTRICT YOUR FEEDING TO A CERTAIN PERIOD OF EACH TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE TO NOT BE EATING AROUND THE CLOCK AND WHETHER NOT THAT'S FOUR HOURS OR EIGHT HOURS OR SIXTEEN HOURS A IS A FUR IS A MUCH LENGTHIER TO DISCUSSION THAN WE HAVE TIME FOR NOW I WOULD REFER YOU TO A SACHIN PANDAS BOOK OF THE CIRCADIAN CODE WHICH TALKS ALL ABOUT THAT HE'S AN EXPERT TO FORMER COLLEAGUE OF MIND FROM THE SALK INSTITUTE IN SANDIEGO YOU CAN EXPLORE INTERMITTEN AND CIRCADIAN A FASTING SO TO SPEAK A THROUGH SACHINS LURCER WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT WE MIGHT AND GET SACH IN IN HERE IF WE'RE IF WE'RE LUCKY AT SOME POINT THE FUTURE BUT YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE LIGHT TO WAKE UP EARLIER JAMIE IGHTS IR AND COLLEAGUES HAD DID A BEAUTIFUL STUDY SHOWING THAT IF YOU TURN ON THE LIGHTS BE FOUR WAKING UP SAROUND FORTY FIVE MINUTES TO AN HOUR BEFORE WAKING UP EVEN IF YOUR EYELIDS OR CLOTHES PROVIDED YOU'RE NOT UNDER THE THE COVERS AFTER DOING THAT FOR A FEW DAYS THAT INCREASES YOUR TOTAL SLEEP TIME AND SHIFTS FORWARD THE TIME AT WHICH YOU FEEL SLEEPY IT MAKES YOU WANT TO GO TO BED EARLIER EACH NIGHT NOW IN A KIND OF A DIABOLICAL WAY THEY DID THIS WITH TEEN AGERS WHO ARE NOTORIOUS FOR WANTING TO WAKE UP LATE AND STAY UP LATE AN WHAT THEY FOUND WAS BRIGHT LIGHT FLASHES JUST TURNING ON THE LIGHTS IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT OVERHEAD LIGHTS CAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO ACTIVATE THE SYSTEM AND THAT'S WHETHER USING OVERHEADLIGHTS EVEN THROUGH THE EYELIDS BEFORE THESE KIDS WOKE UP THEN MADE THOSE KIDS NATURALLY WANT TO GO TO BED EARLIER AND THEY ENDED UP SLEEPING LONGER S THAT'S SOMETHING YOU COULD TRY YOU COULD PUT YOUR LIGHTS ON A TIMER TO GO ON Y A EARLY IN TE E DAY BEFORE YOU WAKE UP YOU COULD OPEN YOUR BLIND SO THAT SUNLIGHT IS COMING THROUGH NOW AGAIN IF YOU YOUL CURL UP UNDER THE COVERS THAN IT'S NOT CAN A REACH A THESE NURONS BUT IT'S REMARKABLE THE LIGHT CANNATUALLY PENETRATE THE EYELIDS ACTIVATE THESE NARONS AND GO TO THE CENTRAL CLOCK THAT STUDY ILLUSTRATES A REALLY IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE OF HOW YOU'RE BUILT WHICH IS YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR WHAT ARE CALLED PHASE ADVANCES AND PHASE DELAYS AND I DON'T WANT TO COMPLICATE THIS TOO MUCH SO THE SIMPLEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT PHASE ADVANCES ISN PHASE DELAYS IS THAT IF YOU SEE LIGHT LATE IN THE DAY AND IN PARTICULAR IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT YOU'RE BRAIN AND BODY FOR REASONS THAT NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WE'LL THINK THAT THAT'S MORNING LIGHT EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT SUNLIGHT BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS HEIGHTENED SENSITIVITY AND IT WILL PHASE DELAY WILL DELAY YOUR CLOCK IT WILL SENTIALLY MAKE YOU WANT TO GET UP LATER AND GO TO SLEEP LATER SO IF YOU GET LIGHT EXPOSURE TOO LATE IN THE EVENING OR IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT HIRD TO WANT TO WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNING EARLY AND TO GO TO BED EARLY THE OPPOSITE IS ALSO TRUE IF YOU WAKE UP EARLY SAY YOU KNOW SIX A M ORE SEVEN A M AND GET LIGHT EXPOSURE OR EVEN EARLIER FORE I AM AND GET LIGHT EXPOSURE IT WILL PHASE ADVANCE YOUR CLOCK OCHAIT'S GAN TO MAKE YOUR CLOCK THINK IT'S EARLIER AND YOU'LL WANT TA WAKE UP EARLIER SO THE SIMPLE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS IF YOURE HAVING TROUBLE WAKING UP EARLY AND FEELING A LERT EARLY IN THE DAY YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO TRY AND GET BRIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE EVEN BEFORE WAKING UP BECAUSE IT WILL ADVANCE YOUR CLOCK IT WILL SENT YOUR SORE LIKE TURNING THE CLOCK FORWARD WHEREAS IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE WAKEN UP EARLY YOU DEFINITLY DON'T WANT TO GET TOO MUCH LIGHT EXPOSURE OR ANY LIGHT EXPOSURE TO YOUR EYES LATE IN THE EVENING AND IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT BECAUSE IT'S JUST GIN A DELAY YOUR CLOCK MORE AND MORE SO RATHER THAN GET INTO THE SPECIFICS OF EVERYBODY'S SITUATION BECAUSE THERE'RE MANY OF YOU OUT THERE WITH DIFFERENT SITUATIONS AND LIFE STYLE REQUIREMENTS ET CETERA THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS THAT YOU HAVE THESE INTERNAL MECHANISMS OF A DENIZENE IN CIRCADIAN CLOCKS AND THEY'RE ALWAYS OPERATING AND WHAT YOUR TRYING TO DO IS PROVIDE THEM ANCHORS YOU'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE THEM CONSISTENT POWERFUL ANCHORS SO THAT YOUR CORTIS ALL YOUR MELOTONE IN AND THEN EVERYTHING THAT'S THAT CASCADES DOWN FROM THAT LIKE YOUR METABOLISM IND YOUR ABILITY TO LEARN IN YOUR SENSE OF ALERTNESS YOUR DOPAMENE YOUR SARE TONE AND ALL THAT STUFF IS TIME REGULARLY ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE'RE SO MUCH A YOU KNOW CHALLENGE OUT THERE WITH FOCUS AND ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AS TERE ARE LOTTER REASONS FOR THAT BUT ONE OF THE REASONS IS THAT PEOPLES INTERNAL MECHANISMS AREN'T ANCHOR TO ANYTHING REGULAR NOW THIS DOESN'T REQUIRE BEING NEURODICALLY ATTACHED TO GETTING UP AT A VERY SPECIFIC TIME GOING OUTSIDE VIEWING THE SUNLIGHT SAME TIME EVERY DAY THESE SYSTEMS AGAIN WILL AVERAGE BUT IF YOU CAN PROVIDE THEM CONSISTENT L IGTE ANKCHORS EARLY IN THE DAY AND IN THE EVENING AND AVOIDING LIGHT AT NIGHT YOU WILL BE AMAZED AT THE TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF POSIVE EFFECTS THAT CAN COME FROM THAT AT THE LEVEL OF METABOLIC FACTORS HORMONES AND JUST GENERAL FEELINGS OF WELL BEING IN FACT MOST OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH WHAT IT IS TO NOT SLEEP WELL AND ALL THE TERRIBLE EFFECTS THAT HAS MAY BE ONE NIGHT YOU'RE FING TWO NIGHTS EVEN FOR THE NEW PARENT PARENTS OUT THERE I I SYMPATHIZE WITH YOU BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHAT IT IS TO SLEEP REALLY REALLY WELL ON A CONSISTENT BASIS AND WHEN YOU START DOING THAT BY CONTROLLING YOUR SLEEP ENVIRONMENT RIGHT GET THE PROPER SLEEP SURFACE GET THE PROPER PILLOW GET THE TEMPERATURE IN THE ROOM RIGHT GET YOUR LIGHT EXPOSURE RIGHT START TIMING YOU'R EXERCISE AT NORMAL PERIODS ARE TIMES THROUGHOUT THE THE DAY AND WEEK IT'S AMAZING HOW MANY OTHER BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS JUST NATURALLY FALL IN LINE AND THIS IS WHY WHENEVER PEOPLE ASK ME WHAT SHOULD I TAKE WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS I GET WHAT SUPPLEMENTSHI TAKE WHAT DRUGS SHOULD I BE TAKING WHAT THINGS SHOULD I BE TAKING THE FIRST QUESTION I ALWAYS ASK THEM IS HOW'S YOUR SLEEP AND NINETY PER CENT OF THE TIME THEY TELL ME THEY EITHERE HAVE TROUBLE FALLING ASLEEP OR STAYING ASLEEP OR THEY DON'T FEEL RESTED THROUGHOUT THE DAY A BRIEF NOTE ABOUT NAPS NAPS PROVIDED THAT THEY'RE LESS THAN ONE OLD TRADY AN CYCLE PRIDE THEY'RE TWENTY MINUTES OR THIRTY MINUTES OR EVEN AN HOUR CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU DON'T HAF TO TAKE THEM BUT MANY PEOPLE NATURALLY FEEL A DIP IN ENERGY AND FOLK IS SLATE IN THE AFTERNOON IN FACT IF WE'REVEN A LOOK AT WAKEFULNESS WELL WE WOULD FIND IS THAT YOU GET THAT MORNING LIGHT EXPOSURE HOPEFULLY YOU'RE CARTIS ALL GOES OUT PEOPLE START FEELING AWAKE AND THEN AROUND TWO OR THREE OR FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON THERE'S A SPIKE IN IN EVERYTHING FROM ALERTNESS TO ABILITY TO LEARN SOME METABOLIC FACTORS DROP AND THEN IT JUST NATURALLY COMES BACK UP AND THEN IT TAPERS OFF ASE THE NIGHT GOES ON SO FOR SOME OF YOU NAPS ARE GREAT I LOVE TAKING NAPS SOME PEOPLE THEY WAKE UP FROM NAPS FEELING REALLY GROGGY THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUE THEY'RE NOT SLEEPING AS WELL AS THEY SHOULD AT NIGHT OR AS LONG AS THEY SHOULD AT NIGHT AN SO THEY'RE DROPPING IN TO REMSLEEP OR DEEPER FORMS OF SLEEP IN THE DAYTIME AND THEN THEY WAKE UP IN THEY FEEL CUNDIN DISORIENTED OTHER PEOPLE FEEL GREAT AFTER A NAP SO THAT'S ANOTHER CASE WHERE JUST LIKE WITH CAFINYOU SORT OF HAVE TO EVALUATE FOR YOURSELF AS WE DISCUSSES YOU'RE PROBABLY REALIZING THIS IS A LOT LIKE NUTRITION WHERE NOWADAYS IT'S JUST CRAZY M AND IF YOU GO ON SOCIAL MEDIATS LIKE YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE WHO ARE PUSHING CARNIVORE YET OTHER PEOPLE ARE PUSHING VIGAN OTHER PEOPLE ARE PUSHING YOU KNOW A PALIO EVERY VARIATION OF EVERY DIET AND THERE'S A LOT OF DATA TO SUPPORT ANY AND ALL OF THOSE AND THE ARGUMENTS GO ON AN ON AND THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT OF GUNETIC VARIATION AND LIFESTALE VARIATION THAT'S GOING TO DICTATE WHETHEY'RE NOT SOMETHING IS GOOD FOR YOU WHETHER NT YOU LIKE IT WHETHER NOT YOU'LL STICK TO IT THE SAME THING IS TRUE FOR CIRCADIAN AND SLEEP AND WAKEFULNESS BEHAVIORS EXCEPT THE LIGHT VIEWING BEHAVOR THAT I TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THERE'S NO WAY AROUND THAT THAT'S HARD WIRED INTOUR SYSTEM THE SAME WAY WE COULD FACTUALLY SAY THAT EVERYBODY NEEDS SOME NEUTRITIAN AT SOME LEVEL FROM SOME SOURCE EVERYBODY NEEDS LIGHT INFORMATION ARRIVING IN THEIR SYSTEM IN SOME WAY AT REGULAR INTERVALS THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT OKESE AND NAPS ARE GOING TO BE GOOD FOR SOME PEOPLE NOT FOR OTHERS I HAVE A COLLEAGUE A VERY ACCOMPLISH NOR AL SCIENTIST WHO LIKES TO TAKE NAPS JUST AFTER LUNCH I PERSONALLY LIKE TO TAKE A NAP AROUND THREE OR FOUR P M BUT THERE'S A PRACTICE THAT I'VE ADOPTED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS THAT I'VE FOUND TO BE IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL THAT IS SORT OF LIKE NAPPING BUT ISN'T NAPPING IT'S A THING THAT THEY CALL YOGAN NIGRA THEOGA NIGER ACTION MEANS YOG A SLEEP AND IT'S A SORT OF MEDITATION THAT YOU LISTEN TO THERE NUMBER OF SCRIPTS I'VE TALKED ABOUT THE SOME POCAS BEFORE BUT I'M GOING TO POST A LINK TO THE TWO THAT I LIKE MOST THAT A LOWS YOU TO CONSCIOUSLY BRING YOUR ENTIRE BODEGU AND MIND INTO A STATE OF DEEP RELAXATION AND SOMETIMES YOU FALL ASLEEP AND SOMETIMES YOU DON'T THIS IS DONE FOR TEN TO THIRTY OR EVEN SIXTY MINUTES AT A TIME THE OTHER THING THAT WORKS REALLY WELL IS MEDITATION SO TIE ABOUT NAPS BUT AM ALSO TALKING ABOUT YOGANIGRO WHICH IS SORT OF A FORM OF MEDITATION AND THEN MORE STANDARD FORMS OF MEDITATION ALL THREE OF THOSE DO SOMETHING POWERFUL WHICH IS THAT THEY BRING OUR MIND INTO A STATE OF LESS SO CALLED SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ACTIVATION GO BACK IN LIS AN EPISODE ONE IF THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE WHICH IS WHAT GOVERNS YOUR ALERTNESS AND INSTEAD IT ACTIVATES SELLS IN CIRCUITS IN YOUR BODY THAT PROMOTE THE PARI SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM OR THE CALMING SYSTEM A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOT GOOD AT FALLING ASLEEP BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOOD AT CALMING DOWN SO SOME PEOPLE HAVE NO TROUBLE FALLING ASLEEP BUT MANY PEOPLE HAVE A HARDTIME FALLING ASLEEP OR AT LEAST EVERY ONCE AND WHILE EXPERIENCE CHALLENGE IS FALLING ASLEEP I DON'T HAVE PROBLEMS FALLING ASLEEP MOST NIGHTS BUT I'DE NOTICE THAT IF I'M WORKING VERY HARD OR IF THE WORLD IS PARTICULARLY STRESSFUL MY MIND GETS INTO A BIT OF A KIND OF OSED LOOP WHERE I TEND TO RUMINATE ON THINGS AND NOT EVEN THING ABOUT ANYTHING IN PARTICULARS JUST CHALLENGING FOR ME TO DISENGAGE AND FALL ASLEEP MEDITATION AND YOGA NIGERSCRIPTS HAVE BEEN IMMENSLY HELPFUL FOR ME IN TERMS OF ACCELERATING THE TRANSITION TO SLEEP SO THEY INVOLVE TAKING A FEW MINUTES TEN TO THIRTY MINUTES OR SO JUST LIKE YOU WOULD FOR A NAP AND JUST LISTENING TO A SCRIPT ALMOST PASSIVELEEP AND IT HAS YOU DO SOME PARTICULAR PATTERNS OF BREATHING AND SOME OTHER O CON A BODY SCAN LIKE THINGS THAT CAN REALLY HELP PEOPLE LEARN TO RELAX NOCCUST IN THAT MOMENT BUT GET BETTER RELAXING AND TURNING OFF THINKING IN ORDER TO FALL ASLEEP WHEN THEY WANT TO DO THAT AT NIGHT THERE'S ANOTHER THING THAT SIMILAR TO THIS WHICH IS CERTAIN FORMS OF HYPNOSIS FOR SLEEP FOR THAT I'LL JUST REFER YOU TO THE WEBSIDE OF A COLLEAGUE AND COLLABORATOR OF MIND DAVID SPEAGLE WHOSE ARE ASSOCIA CHAIR OF PSYCHITRY AND BEHAVE RAL SCIENCES AT STAMFORD HE'S DEVELOPED A WEBSITE A WHICH IS REVERI ARE EE VE E ARE I E HEALTH DOT CALMS OR REVERY HEALTH DOT CALM THAT HAS A LOT OF SCIENCE SUPPORTED CLINICALLY SUPPORTED HYPNOSIS SCRIPTS THAT ESSENTIALLY TAKE THE BRAIN INTO STATES OF DEEP RELAXATION O FORSAKE OF REWIRING THE BRAIN AND NERAL PLASTICITY BUT ONE OF THOSE SCRIPS THAT'S THERE AND IS AVAILABLE FREE IS FOR SLEEP AND WILL TALK MORE ABOUT HYPNOSIS AT A LATER TIME BECAUSE IT HAS A TON OF OTHER EFFECTS THAT AREN'T JUST LIMITED TO SLEEP SO A PERIOD OF TIME EACH DAY THAT YOU DEVOTE TO GETTING BETTER AT FALLING AND STAYING ASLEEP IS AT SHLE A REALLY GOOD PRACTICE TO ADOPT THE OTHER THING ABOUT THESE PRACTICES LIKE MEDITATION YOGANIDRA AND HYPNOSIS AS PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY TO ME WHELL WHEN SHOULD I DO THEM AND I WE SAY WLE THE BEST TIME OF DAY TO DO IT IS WHEN YOU FIRST WAKE UP IN THE MORNING PROVIDED YOU GET YOUR SUNLIGHT ALREADY ANY TIME YOU WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT OR ANY TIME OF DAY IN OTHER WORDS THERRE ALWAYS GOOD FOR YOU BECAUSE IT'S A TRAINING MECHANISM BY WHICH YOU SELF TRAIN YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM TO GO FROM A STATE OF HEIGHTENED ALERTNESS THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO HEIGHTEN RELAXATION THAT YOU DO WANT AND SO IT'S REALLY TEACHING YOU TO HIT THE BRIGHKE AND THAT BRINGS US TO AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANT POINT PERHAPS WHICH IS WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED THAT WE CAN STAY UP IF WE WANT TO RIGHT IF WE WANT A STAY UP LAID ON NEW YEARS ORE WE WANT A PUSHIN ALL NIGHT OR SOME PEOPLE CAN DO THAT MORE EASILY THAN OTHERS BUT WE'RE ALL CAPABLE OF DOING THAT BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE OURSELVES FALL ASLEEP AND SO THERE'S A SORT OF A SYMMETRY TO THE WAY OUR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH GOVERNS THIS ALERTNESS CALMNESS THING THE SYMPATHETIC IMPARISYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THERE'S AN A SYMMETRY THERE WHERE WE ARE MORE EASILY ABLE TO ENGAGE WAKEFULNESS AND DRIVE WAKEFULNES WE CAN FORCE OURSELVES TO STAY AWAKE THAN WE ARE ABLE TO FORCE OURSELVES TO FALL ASLEEP ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I SAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN ND I'MAT A CONTINUE TO SAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS IT'S VERY HARD TO CONTROL THE MIND WITH THE MIND WHEN YOU HAVE TROUBLE FALLING ASLEEP YOU NEED TO LOOK TO SOME MECHANISM THAT INVOLVES THE BODY AND ALL THE THINGS I DESCRIBED MEDITATION HYPNOSIS YOGANITRA ALL INVOLVE EXHALE EMPHASIZED BREATHING CERTAIN WAYS OF LYING DOWN AND CONTROLLING THE BODY WERE GOINGTO GET INTO BREATHING IN REAL DEPTH AT ANOTHER TIME BUT ALL O THOSE INVOLVE USING THE BODY TO CONTROL THE MIND RATHER THAN TRING TO YOU KNOW WRESTLE YOUR MIND INTO A CERTAIN PATTERN OF RELAXATION SO EARLIER AN EPISODE ONE I TALKED ABOUT THE MOBIOUS STRIP THIS CONTINUOUS LOOP THAT IS THE BRAIN BODY RELATIONSHIP OR THE MIND BODY RELATIONSHIP AND WHEN WE'RE HAVING TROUBLE CONTROLLING THE MIND I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO LOOK TOWARDS THE BODY LOOK TOWARD SUNLIGHT AVOID SUNLIGHT IF IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT IF THAT HAPPENS TO BE LATE AT NIGHT SO THERE'S A THEME THAT STARTING TO EMERGE WHICH IS IN ORDER TO CONTROL THIS THING THAT WE CALL THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WE HAVE TO LOOK BACK TO SOME OF THE THINGS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER LIKE SENSATION PERCEPTION ET CETERA BUT WE HAVE TO ASK WHAT CAN WE CONTROL WELL I'M TING UT CONTROLLING LIGHT EXPOSURE CONTROLLING YOUR BREATHING AND BODY I'M NOT GOING INTO DETAILS RIGHT NOW BUT YOU CAN SEE THE YOGANITRSCRIPT OR THE REVERY HEALTH DOK CALM OR HEADSPACE WOULD BE A GREAT PLACE TO ADOPT THE MEDITATION PRACTICE ANY OF THOSE ARE REALLY TEACHING YOU TO USE YOUR BODY TO CONTROL YOUR MIND AND TO ALLOW YOU TO EXPLORE THE MIND BODY RELATIONSHIP IN A WAY THAT GIVES YOU MORE CONTROL OVER YOUR MIND AND THE MIND MODY RELATIONSHIP OK SO WE TALKED ABOUT LIGHT WE TALKED ABOUT ACTIVITY AND TIMING OF LIGHT TALKED ABOUT THE USEFULNESS OF NAPS AND THESE THINGS THAT I'M CALLING NON SLEEP DEP REST WHICH INCLUDE MEDITATION YOGONIDRA AND HYPNOSIS NON SLEEP DEEP REST OR WHAT ID HEREAFTER WERE WE WILL REFER TO AS N S D R NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH E M D R I'DONLY HAVE EVER HEARD N S D R O I'M I'M UMPLANTING A FLAG FOR N S D R NON SLEEP DEEP REST AS A WAY TO RESET ONE'S ABILITY TO BE AWAKE AFTER YOU EMERGE FROM AN S D R SO TO GET SOME MORE WAKEFULNESS AND ABILITY TO ATTEND SOME EMOTIONAL STABILITY RESET AS WELL AS MAKE IT BETTER AND EASIER TO FALL ASLEEP WHEN YOU WANT TO GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT NOW NON SLEEP DEEP REST DOES HAVE SOME RESEARCH TO SUPPORT IT THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL STUDY DONE OUT OF A UNIVERSITY IN DENMARK I WILL LATER PROVIDE A LINK TO THAT STUDY THAT SHOWED THAT THIS MEDITATION AND YOGONIDRATYPE MEDITATION ALOWS DOPOMINE AND OTHER NEROMODULATORS IN AN AREA THE BRING CALLED THE STRIATUM THAT'S INVOLVED IN MOTOR PLANNING AN MOTOR EXECUTION TO RESET ITSELF IN OTHER WORDS THIS N S D R CAN RESET OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN THE WORLD IN A WAY THAT'S VERY DELIBERATE IN NOT TO THROW IN ANOTHER ACRENYM BUT N S D R RESETS YOUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN D P OS DURATION PATH AND OUTCOME AS A NOW YOUR POLLY ROLL IN YOUR EYES LIKE OING GONES THE NUMBER OF ACRANYMS BUT JUST BEAR WITH ME BECAUSE N S D R IS SO POWERFUL BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT YOU RIG YOURSELF TO ANY DEVICE IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT YOU TAKE MUCH TIME OUT OF YOUR DAY IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT YOU INJEST ANYTHING EXCEPT AIR AND IT CAN HAVE SO MANY POSITIVE EFFECTS RIGHT DOWN TO THE NERMODULATOR LEVEL SO I THINK IN YEARS TO COME MY LABS EXPLORING THIS AND ACLABRATION WITH DAVIDS BEGLES LAB BUT OTHER LABS OR LOOK A THIS AS WELL I THINK N S  R IS GOING TO START TO PLAY A MORE PROMINENT ROLL IN WHAT WE CALL WELLNESS AND HEALTH BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO EXPLORE THOSE PRACTICES OKAO WHAT ABOUT THINGS THAT WE CAN AND MAY BE SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT TAKE IN ORDER TO CONTROL AND ACTS ASS BETTER SLEEP AND BETTER WAKEFULNESS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THINGS YOU CAN DO OR NOT DO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT NUTRITION AND THE TIMING OF NUTRITION NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT COMPOUNDS THOSE COAL BE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THOSE CAN BE SUPPLEMENTS THEIR NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WILL EFFECT YOUR CIRCADIAN TIMING AND BEHAVIOR IN FACT ALMOST EVERYTHI ING THAT YOU COULD TAKE WILL EFFECT YOUR CIRCATIAN TIMING AN BEHAVIOR THAT'S RIGHT SO YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS IN GRADUATE SCHOL I HAD A PROFESSOR AND FORCEING YOU PASSED AWAY NOW BUT IS NAME WAS TED JONES TE LATE EDWARD JONDES WHO WAS A WORLD CLASSNEROANATOMAS YOU WROTE THE BOOK ON THE PHALMUS IN FACT IT'S CALLED THE FALMUS AND AN EXPERT ON PATTERNS OF ACTIVATION IN THE BRAIN DURING SLEEP ANDI'LL NEVER FORGET THAT DURING ONE OF THESE LECTURES SOME ONE ASKED TEAD THE QUESTION NOW WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF SOME DRUG ON THESE WAVES OF ACTIVITY IN THE PHALMUS OR SOMETHING AND HIS ANSWER WAS INCREDIBLE IT WAS A PRETTY GRUFF GUY AND SO HIS ANSWER WAS DELIVERED IN THE FORM OF A KIND OF AGGRESSIVE DIRECT STATEMENT HE SAID A DRUG IS A SUBSTANCE THAT WHEN INJECTED INTO A PERSON PRODUCES A SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATION AND WHAT HE WAS SAYING IS ACTUALLY QUITE TRUE WHICH IS THAT MOST EVERY COMPOUND WI'LL HAVE SOME EFFECT ON SOME ASPECT OF BIOLOGY THIS IS WHY IT'S HARD TO SORT THROUGH EVERYTHING THAT'S ON PUBMET IF YOU PUT ANY MOLECULE OR COMPOUND OR DRUG INTO PUBMED AND THEN YOU PUT SLEEP NEXT TO IT OR ALERTNESS NEXT TO IT YOU'RE LIKELY TO FIND A PAPER WHERE THERE IS AN EFFECT BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TELLING YOU THAT THAT DRUG IS USEFUL OR HELPFUL FOR THAT WHAT IT'S TELLING YOU IS THAT ANY TIME YOU CHANGE WHAT YOU TAKE OR YOU STOP TAKING SOMETHING SE YOU'RE TAKING SLEEPING PILLS AMBIAN OR WHATEVER IT IS AND YOU STOP TAKING THEM YOUR SLEEP BEHAVIOR WILL CHANGE LET'S SAY YOU TAKE AN ASPERAN YOU DON'T NORMALLY TAKE ASPERAN YOU WILL SHIFT YOUR CIRCATIAN RHYTHM NOW YOU MAG NOT SHIFT IT PERCEPTIBLY YOU MIGHT NOT CREATE PROMS FOR YOURSELF BUT ANY TIME YOU INJEST A COMPOUND AT HIGH POTENCY YOU'RE GOING TO CHAINT PROVIDE SOME SHIFT TO YOUR CIRCADIAN RHYTHM NOW THAT SAID THERE ARE COUPLE THINGS THAT ARE DIRECTLY IN LINE WITH THE BIOLOGY RELATED TO FALLING AND STAYING ASLEEP AND DIRECTLY IN LINE WITH THE BIOLOGY WAKEFULNESS H WHOLE CATEGORY OF THINGS LIKE STIMULANTS COCANE AND PHEDAMINE AND PRESCRIPTION STIMULANTS THAT ARE A THE PRESCRIPTION ONES WERE DESIGN FOR THE TREATMENT OF NARCILEPSYTHO SO THINGS LIKE MODAPHENEL OR ARMADAPHINO THAT ARE DESIGED TO CREATE WAKEFULNESS THEY ARE ALL ESSENTIALLY A CHEMICAL VARIANCE OF THINGS THAT INCREASE EPINEPERAN AN DOPAMINE NOW OF COURSE I'M OF THE THE STANDPOINT THAT THINGS LIKE COCENA AN PHEDAMINE ARE JUST ACROSS THE BOARD BAD THEY HAVE SO MANY ADDICTIVE AND TERRIBLE EFFECTS IN THE PROPER SETTING PRESCRIBED BY IT THE PROPER PROFESSIONAL THINGS LIKE MODAPHANOL FOR NARCILEPSY ON MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE I KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE TAKE AT ER ALL EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVEN'T BEEN PRESCRIBED AT ER ALL IN ORDER TO INCREASE WAKEFULNESS THAT IS ESSENTIALLY  YOU KNOW WHIIT'S E LEGAL FOR ONE BUT IT'S ALSO IT'S ABUSING THE SYSTEM IN THE SENSE THAT YOU'RE PUSHING BACK ON THE IDENTICINE SYSTEM SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU DO CAPHINE A IT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL MORE ALERT THERE TENDS TO BE A HEAVY REBOUND AND THEY DOU HAVE AN ADDICTIVE POTENTIAL THERE ALSO SOME OTHER EFFECTS OF THOSE THAT CAN BE QUITE BATS O'RE GON TO EXPLORE A STIMULANTS IN A WHOLE MONTH  RELATED TO DRUGS BUT THERE ARE SOME SUPPLEMENTS AND SOME THINGS THAT ARE S FER SERTAINLY SAFER AND THAT IN CASES WHERE YOU'RE DOING ALL THE RIGHT BEHAVIORS YOUR EXERCISING AND EATING CORRECTLY AND YOU'RE STILL HAVING TROUBLE WITH SLEEP THAT CAN BE BENEFICIAL FOR FALLING IN STAING ASLEEP NOW I WONTO BE VERY CLEAR I AM NOT PUSHING SUPPLEMENTS I AM JUST POINTING YOU TOWARDS SOME THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN IN PURE REVIEWED STUDIES TO HAVE SOME BENEFIT THE FIRST ONE IS MAGNESIUM THERE ARE MANY FORMS OF MAGNESIUM BUT CERTAIN FORMS OF MAGNESIUM CAN HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON SLEEPINESS IN THE ABILITY O STAY ASLEEP MAINLY BY WAY OF INCREASING NAR A TRANSMITTERS LIKE GABA WHICH HELP TURN OFF THE DE P O THE KIND OF THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE DURATION PATH OUTCOME AN ALASIS AND MAKE ONE SORT OF AM ONE'S MIND  KIND OF DRIFT IN SPACE AND TIME AU MAKE IT EASIER TO FALL ASLEEP THEREARE LOT OF FORMS OF MAGNESIUMOUNT THERE BUT ONE IN PARTICULAR IS MAGNESIUM THREE IN HT T H R E O AND  T E WHICH YOU HAVE TO CHECK TO SEE IF THIS RIGHT IS RIGHT FOR YOU CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR BUT MAGNESIUM THREE AN A IS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSPORTERS IN THE BODY THAT BRING MORE OF IT INTO CELLS THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO FEEL THIS KIND OF DROWSINESS AND ELP THEM FALL ASLEEP SO I PERSONALLY I CAN ONLY TALK ABOUT WHAT I PERSONALLY DO I PERSONALLY TAKE THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM THREE AND EIGHT ABOUT THIRTY TO SIXTY MINUTES BEFORE SLEEP AND IT HELPS ME FALL ASLEEP THE OTHER THING IS THEANINE T H E A A T H E A N I N E THENINE A HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF THENINE FOR ME ALSO HELPS ME TURN OFF MY MIND AND FALL ASLEEP I TO GET THIRTY TO SIXTY MINUTESTHROUGHOUT THE DAY INTERESTINGLY THENINE IS NOW BEING INTRODUCED TO A LOT OF ENERGY DRINKS IN ORDER TO TAKE AWAY THE GITTERS THAT AR ASSOCIATED WITH DRINKING TOO MUCH KAFINE OR WITH SOME OTHER THINGS THER IN THE ENERGY DRINKS ENERGY DRINKS ARE CAN BE PROBLEMATIC OM THEY CAN CONTAIN A LOT OF ALTORINE I'LL JUST TELL YOU AN ANECDOTE WHEN I WAS A POSTOCK I WAS DRINKING A LOT OF A PARTICULAR ENERGY DRINK HAS A LOT OF TORENE IN IT AND A ACTUALLY THE THE A WHITES OF MY EYES THE SCALERA AS IT'S CALLED TOF MY EYES TURN BT RED AND I WENT TO A FRIEND WHO IS NOT PLEMOLOGIST OM I SAID LOOK I'M NO MARWAN A SMOKER I HAVEN' BEEN HID ON THE HEAD I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND HE LOOKED AN HE SAID I THINK YOU'VE GOT SOME MICROVASCULAR DAMAGE AND WE WALK THROUGH WHAT I WAS TAKING AN DOING HE SAID OH IT'S PROBABLY THE TORINE EXCESSIVE LEVELS OF TORINE CAN CREATE SOME MICROVASCULAR DAMAGE SO IF YOUR HAVING MICROVASCLO DAMAG IN YOUR EYE YOUR PROBABLY HAVE MICROVASCULAR DAMAGE DEEPER A IN YOUR SKULL SO I STOP THAT'S A REASON WHY I DON'T TAKE ENERGY DRINKS SUGGESTED A CONSIDERATION AGAIN I'M NOT HERE TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO OR NOT DO BUT JUST WONE ARMYOU WITH INFORMATION THE THE THING ABOUT THENINE AND MAGNESIUM IS TAKEN TOGETHER THEY DO FOR SOME PEOPLE THET CAN MAKE THEM SOCLEEPIY AND SLEEP SO DEEPLY THAT THE ACTUA TROUBLE WAKING UP IN THE MORNING SO YOU HAVE TO PLAY WITH THESE THINGS AND TITRATE THEM IF YOU DECIDE TO USE THEM AGAIN IF YOU DECIDE TO GO THIS ROUTE I WOULD NOT START BY TAKING SUPPLEMENTS I WOULD START BY GETTING YOUR LIGHT VIEWING BEHAVIOUR CORRECT AND THEN THINK ABOUT YOUR NUTRITIAN AND THEN THINK ABOUT YOUR ACTIVITY AND THEN THINK ABOUT WHETHER NOT YOU WANT A SUPPLEMENT WE ALWAY TALKED ABOUT MELITONE AN EARLIER THERE'S ANOTHER SUPPLEMENT THAT WOU BE QUITE USEFUL WHICH IS APIGENIN A P I G E N I N WHICH IS DERIVET OF CAMIMILE FIFTY MELIGRAMS ABAPIGENIN ALSO CAN AUGMENT OR SUPPORT THIS KIND OF AM CREATION OF A SLEEPYNESS A TO HELPFALL ASLEEP IN STAY ASLEEP A NOTE ABOUT SLEEP WALKERS AND PEOPLE WITH VERY VIVID DREAMS THENINE CAN OFTEN MAKE YOUR DREAMS VERY VIVID SLEEP WALKERS SHOULD BE CAREFUL ABOUT TAKING PHEANINE EVERY ONE SHOULD BE CAREFUL ABOUT TAKING ANYTHING AND DON'T TAKE ANYTHING WITHOUT CONSULTING YOUR BORD CERTIFIED EMDY OR HELP CARE PROFESSIONAL FIRST O AM YOUR HEALTH IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY I AM NOT GOIN TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT YOU DECIDE TO DO EXPERIMENTALLY IN ANY CASE BUT ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TE SUPPLEMENTATION IN DRUGS AS A IMPORTANT POINT APIGENIN IS A FAIRLY POTENT ESTERGEN IN HIBITER SO WOMEN WHO WANT TO KEEP THE ESTERGEN LEVELS HIGH WHERE AT WHATEVER LEVELS THEY HAPPEN TO BE AT SHOULD PROBABLY AVOID APIGEN AN ALTOGETHER AND MEN TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AS WELL OF MEN NEED ESTERGEN ALLSOD YOU DON'T WANT O COMPLETELY ELIMINATE YOUR ESTERGEN THAT IT CAN CREATE ALL SORTS OF BAD EFFECTS ON LEBIDO AND COGNITION ET CETERA SO AM APIGENIN AND SOME PEOPLE IS GOING TO BE A PRETTY STRONG ESTERGEN IN HIBITOR SO A KEEP THAT IN MIND THERE ARE OTHER THINGS YOU CAN TAKE TO HELP YOU SLEEP BETTER AM THOSE OF THE LEGAL ONES THAT I AT LEAST I'M AWARE OF HAVE PRETTY BROAD SAFETY MARGINS BUT AGAIN YOU NEED TO EXPLORE YOUR SAFETY MARGIANS WITH ANY COMPOUND I THINK A GREAT WEBSITE THAT I CAN REFER YOU TO IS EXAMINED OT CALM EXAMINE THE WORD JUST AS IT SOUNDS DOT CALM IS A WEBSIDE I HAVE NO RELATION TO THEM BUT THERE YOU CAN FIND A LINX TO PURE REVIEWED STUDIES FOR ANY COMPOUND OR SUPPLEMENT AS WELL AS SOME IMPORTANT WARNINGS RELATED TO THE THINGS I DISCUSSED AS WELL AS ANY OTHER THING THAT YOU MIGHTE DECIDE TO SUPPLEMENT WITH OR IN JEST TO HELP IMPROVE YOUR SLEEP O KHE THAT WAS A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO GET BETTER AT SLEEPING FALLING ASLEEP WAKEFULNESS ET CETERA AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THIS PODCAST

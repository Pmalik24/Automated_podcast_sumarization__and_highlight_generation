DIFFERENT THERE'S NOWRE HAD FOR THAT BODN SOM MANS O PRODUCER ON HER SHO AT ON BAD BLESS AMERICA IN APR WHEN WE FIRST STARTED TALKING TO THE STAFF AT HENRY FORD THE INTENT OF CARRIUNI WAS STRUGGING WITH SOMETHING THEY HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE ALL THESE PATIENTS WHOICH IS NOT GETTING BETTER THESE RECOVIED PATIENCE WOULD EITHER DIE FOR THEYD STAY STUCK ON FENAWATERS FOR WEEKS AND THE STAFF HAD NO IDEA HOW TO GET THEM OFF WHEN THE DOCTOR RED ODT IS SH WE HEARD THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW WHICH CIRCULATE THROUGH THE HOSPITAL TALKING A STAFF AND CHECKING IN THEY ALL KNEW THAT SHE HAS A VERY PARTICULAR APPROACH TO MEDICINE AN PATIENT CARE BOUT MAKING MEEK WELCOME BACK HAGAN IRA SO YHAT RENAS WHOLE APPROACH TO MEDICINE COMES OUT OF AN EXPERIENCE SHE HAD BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AH SHE WAS A DOCTOR HERE WIT HENRY FORWARD AND THEN SHE LANDED IN HER OWN I SEE WAS A PATIENT SHE HAD MILTI SYSTEM ORGAN FAILURE WENT ON A VENTILATER AND SHE TOLD ME HER COWORKERS ACTED LIKE SHE COULDN'T HEAR THEM BUT SHE ACTUALLY COULD WHAT SHOCKED AND AT SET ME THE MOST WAS OVER HEARING A RESIDENT IN THE WHALWAY SAY SHE'S TRYING TO DYE ON ME AN HEARING IN THE OPERATING ROOM SHE CIRCLING THE DRAN THE SONSER SCARED TO HEAR THAT YAH IT WAS SO AN DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE MY OWN RECOVERY WHEN EVERYONE AROUND ME WAS TALKING ABOUT ME AS IF I WAS DYING A YOU KNOW I I HAD SAID SIMILAR SANES SHE CIRCLING THE TRAIN YE AN IT WAS A CULTURE A FORVONEM AND IT WAS SHOWING THAT YOU WERE UNTOUCHED MY SUFFERING IT WAS THAT IT DIDN'T MANNER AND ONE OF THE THINGS IVE ALWAYS FELT FOR TO BE SHAMED ABOUTIS THET ER PATIENTS HAVE BEEN TELLING U TESPINGS FOR YEARS O WHEN SHE RECOVERED SHE RETURNED TO HER JOB AT THE HOSPITAL WITH A NEW MIND SAT IT WAS ALL ATOUT AMPATHY THET EMPATHY WOULD MAKE HER A BET TER DOCTOR NOT WORSE WHICH WAS THE OPPOSITE OF HER TRAINING SHE BEEN TAUGHT THAT TO MICH NEELING CLOUDS OF DOCTORS JUDGMENT SHE AN A SMALL TEAM REVAMPED THE WAY THE WHOLE SYSTEM TOKS TO PATIENTS AND RENNER WHAT A BOOK ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE THAT NOW USED IN METICAL SCHOOLS BUT WHELDN'T COVET HITHER I SEE YOU IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE STAFF TO DO SOME OF THE THINGS RAN UP IN PLACE LIKE BEFORE COVED WHEN SOMEONE ARRIVED UNCONSCIOUS ORCIDATED INTO THE ICY VEW HIT AWAYS ASKED THE FAMILY WOULD YOU THINK HER LOVE ONE WOULD WANT ME TO KNOW ABOUT THEM FAMILIES WOULD PUT UP VOTOS AND BRING QUILTS PERSONALZE THE ROOMS THE STAFFLEY LIKE THAT THEY REALLY WANTED TO GET TO KNOW THE PERSON THEY BE CARING FOR BUT UNDER COVET ALL THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FAMMIES COULD NO LONGER COME IN GET TO KNOW THE STAFF I HAD ONE NURS FARME JUST YESTER GO I YOU LIKE ALL MY PATIEN FOR THE FAME LIKEUHAT DOES NOT MEAN ALL THE SAME AND IN THIS CASE THEY ALL HAVE COVIDNEMONIA THERE ALL PRONED THERE ALL IN THE VENILATER AND SO THERE WAS THE RISK OF OF D PERSONALIZAION FRAR THE PATIENTE SHE THAIT GETTING TO KNOW THEIR PATIENCE WAS A PART OF THEIR JOB BUT THEY REALLY GOT A LOT OFFAT IFFACTION OUT OF BUT THEY DIDN'T WHOLLY REALIZE THAT UNTIL COVI TOOK IT AWAY THIS CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE HOSPITAL WAS BIGGEST FOR THE NURSES THERGE THE ONE TO SPEND THE MOST TIME WITH COVID PATIENTS AND OUR NEXT TROY IS ABOUT THE NURSING STAFF AND POD FOR THE I SEE YOU AND HEMRYFOR IS BROKEN UP INTO THESE PODS POD FOUR WAS ONE OF THE FRONT LINE IN THE HOSPITAL'S COVA NINETEEN EFFORT IT WAS THE VERY FIRST POD DESIGNATED AS ALL CORON OF IRIS PATIENTS FOR THE OTHER I SEE YOU PODS ALSO BECAME ALL COVED ALL THE TIME BAN CALHOUN SPENT WEEKS TALKING TO THE NURSES IN POD FOR BY MID APRIL THE NURSES IN POD FOR HAD ADAPTED TO THE ALTERNATE UNIVERSE OF COVID NINETEEN AT LEAST IN CERTAIN WAYS WHAT I MEAN TAKE JUST THE P P E THAT'S THE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THEY HAD TO WEAR TO GO INTO COVIT ROOMS THIS WAS A HIGH STAKES THING AT THIS POINT PEOPLE HAD SEEN TEN ICY USTAFF GET COVIT TWO COLLEGUES WERE IN VENTILATORS ONE NURSE HAD DIED  SOME PEOPLE GOT SUPERSTITIOUS ABOUT ILWAYS PUT ON MY GLOVES IN THIS ORDER IALWAYS WEAR A SCRUB CAP UNDER THE PAPER CAB AND THEN I WON'T GET SICK WHAT I DIDN'T GET ABOUT THE P P E UNTIL TALKING TO THE NURSES AND POD FOR WAS THE MUNDANE RELENTLESS CRAZY MAKING THIS OF THE VERY GEAR KEEPING THEM SAFE THIS ARDUOUS VIRTUAL OF RUBERT GLOVS TIE UP GOWNS PE ONE HUNDRED RESPIRATORS THAT LOOK LIKE GAS MASS CLEAR PLASTIC FACE SHIELDS IT TOOK FIVE MINUTES TO PUT IT ON TO GO INTO A ROOM FIVE TO EIGHT MINUTES TO TAKE IT OFF WHEN YOU COME OUT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO DO THIS AS MANY AS TWO DOZEN OR MORE TIMES EVERY SINGLE SHIFT HOW LONG IT TOOK TO GET INTO A ROOM BECAUSE OF ALL THE P P E IS ACTUALLY A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW COVID CHANGED WHAT IT WAS LIKE FOR PEOPLE TO DO EVEN JUST THE BASIC AND NORMAL PARTS OF THEIR JOBS AVAN GAFFI IS A NURS IN POD FOR HE SAYS YOU HAVE THESE IC U ROOMS WITH WINDOWS OUT ON TO THE HALLWAY LIKE ALL SHIP LONG YOU HEAR PEOPLE BANGING ON THE THE GLASS WINDOWS ECAUSE THEY NEED BE EUNLY WONT INTO THE ROOM AND THEY FORGOT YOU KNOW THER SUPPLIES TO TO DRAW BLOOD OR THEY FORGOT ONE MEDICATION SO SO THAT'S LIKE A REGULAR SOUND YES IT'S VERY IRRITATING OH BUT WE'RE ALL DOING IT TO EACH OTHER SO THAT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF LIKE A BOOMBOOBOOM OH NOT AGAIN YET YE IT WAS HARD IN THE NEW WORLD OF COVED TO EVEN COMMUNICATE WITH THESE PATIENTS TO EXPLAIN WHERE THEY WERE AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND TO REASSURE THEM AND TO CONNECT WITH THEM IN THE WAY THAT THEY'RE USED TO THE WAY RAN OTISH TOKS ABOUT IT WERE STILL PUZZLING OUT THE WAYS TO DO THAT THESE PATIENTS MANY OF THEM WERE SEDATED ALONE IN A ROOM WITH THE NONSTOP SOUND OF THE VENTILATOR WHICH IS LOUD IT'S IKE A VAC SO NURSES HAD TO SHOUT THROUGH THEIR PEOP ONE HUNDRED MANS WHICH IS LIKE A GAS MANS AND A CLEAR PLASTIC FACE SHIELD OVER THE ROAR OF THE VENTILATOR    NOW ITS IREALLYN YOU'RE SPEAKING THROUGH YOUR EYES IS THAT'S REARLY ALL I CAN S ANTHONY VALARY ANOTHER NURSE IN POD FOR YOU GOT A SPEAK THROUGH YOUR EYES BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SEE IT OR YOU JUST EXPLAIN TO THET THAT YOU'RE SMILING YONGLY TIMES I'VE SAID

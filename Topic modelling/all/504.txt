WELCOME TO THE HUBERMEN LATPONENS S A SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TOS FI MAN DRUHUBERMENE AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TODAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ALL ABOUT DOPAMINE AND WHAT DRIVES YOU TO DO THE THINGS THAT YOU DO WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MOTIVATION AND DESIRE AND CRAVING BUT ALSO HOW DOPAMINE RELATES TO SATISFACTION AND OUR FEELINGS OF WELL BEINE AND OF COURSE ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT DOPAMINE HAS TO INCLUDED DISCUSSION ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR DOPAMINE INDUCED A DICTION INDEED DOPAMINE LIES AT THE HEART OF A DICTION TO ALL THINGS BUT TO DAY WE ARE MAINLY GOING TO FOCUS ON HOW WHAT WE DO AND HOW WE DO IT AND HOW WE CONCEPTIALIZE THOSE THINGS LEADS TO CHANGES IN THIS AMAZING MOLECULE IN OUR BRAIN AN BODIES THAT WE CALL DOPAMIE I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU WHAT DOPAMINE IS AND WHAT IT IS NOT HERE ARE A LOT OF MYTHS ABOUT THE MOLECULE DOPAMINE WE OFTEN HEREABOUT SO CALLED DOPAMINE HITS TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO DISPELL MANY COMMON MYTHS ABOUT DOPAMINE AND WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW DOPAMINE ACTUALLY WORKS WERE GOING TO DISCUSS THE BIOLOGY OF DOPAMINE THE PSYCHOLOGY WE WILL DISCUSS SOME NERRAL CIRCUITS AND A REALLY EXCITING ASPECT OF DOPAMINE BIOLOGY ARE SO CALLED DOPAMINE SCHETUALS IN OTHER WORDS WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS HOW THINGS LIKE FOOD DRUGS CAFINE PORNOGRAPHY EVEN SOME PLANTBASE COMPOUNDS CAN CHANGE OUR BASELINE LEVELS OF DOPAMINE AND IN DOING SO THEY CHANGE HOW MUCH DOPAMINE WE ARE CAPABLE OF EXPERIENCING FROM WHAT COULD BE VERY SATISFYING EVENTS OR EVENTS THAT MAKE US FEEL NOT SO GOOD BECAUSE OF THINGS THAT WE DID OR TOOK PRIOR SO I PROMISE YOU IT'S GOING TO BE A VAST DISCUSSION BUT I WILL STRUCTURE IT FOR YOU AND YOU'LL COME AWAY WITH A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF REALLY WHAT DRIVES YOU YOU WILL ALSO COME AWAY WITH A LOT OF TOOLS HOW TO LEVERAGE DOPAMNE SO THAT YOU CAN SUSTAIN ENERGY DRIVE IN MOTIVATION FOR THE THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO YOU OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME BEFORE WE DIVE INTO THE MEAT OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION I LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU A FASCINATING RESULT THERE REALLY UNDERSCORES WHAT DOPAMINE IS CAPABLE OF IN OUR BRAINS AND BODIES END UNDERSCORES THE FACT THAT JUST THROUGH BEHAVIORS NO DRUGS NOTHING OF THAT SORT JUST THROUGH BEHAVIORS WE CAN ACHIEVE TERRIFICALLY HIGH INCREASES IN DOPAMINE THAT ARE VERY LONG IN SUSTAINED IN WAYS THAT SERVE US THIS IS A RESULT THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY I'LL GOING TO IT IN MORE DETAIL LATER BUT ESSENTIALLY WHAT IT INVOLVED IS HAVING HUMAN SUBJECTS GET INTO WATER OF DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES SO IS WARM WATER MODERATELY COOL WATER AND COLD COLD WATER HAVE THEM STAY IN THAT WATER FOR UP TO AN HOUR AND THEY MEASURED BY WAY OF BLOOD DRAW THINGS LIK QARTES ALL NOR APINEFERIN AND DOPAMINE WHAT WAS FASCINATING IS THAT COLD WATER EXPOSURE LED TO VERY RAPID INCREASES IN NORIPINEFRON AND EPINEFRON WHICH IS ALSO JUST COLLD A DRENALINE IT ALSO LED TO INCREASES IN DOPAMNE AND THESE INCREASES IN DOPAMINE WERE VERY SIGNIFICANT THE KICKED IN AROUND TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES AFTER SUBMERSION INTO THE COLD WATER AND I SHOULD MENTION THE HEAD WAS IN BELOW WATER IS JUST UP TO THE NECK AND THE DOPAMINE RELEASE CONTINUE TO TO RISE AND RISE AND RISE AND EVENTUALLY REACH TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PER CENT ABOVE BASELINE NOW WHAT WAS INTERESTING IS AFTER SUBJECTS GOT OUT OF THIS COLD WATER THAT DOPAMINE INCREASE WAS SUSTAINED AND NI KNOW NOWADAYS MANY PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN USING COLD WATER THEROPE AS A WAY TO INCREASE METABOLISM AND FAT LOSS BUT ALSO TO IMPROVE SENSE OF WELL BEING IMPROVE COGNITION IMPROVE CLARITY OF MIND ON THERE SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL ABOUT THIS VERY ALERT BUT CALM STATE OF MIND THAT SEEMS TO BE THE ONE THAT'S OPTIMUL FOR PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING EXCEPT SLEEP BUT FOR ALL ASPECTS OF WORK AND FOR SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT AND FOR SPORT THAT HIGHLY ALERT BUT CALM STATE OF MIND REALLY IS THE SWEET SPOT THAT I BELIEVE MOST OF US WOULD LIKE TO ACHIEVE AND THIS COLD WATER EXPOSURE DONE CORRECTLY REALLY CAN HELP PEOPLE ACHIEVE THAT STATE OF MIND THROUGH THESE INCREASES IN DOPAMINE THAT LAST A VERY LONG TIME SO I WILL LATER DETAIL THE SPECIFICS OF THAT STUDY WHAT IT INTAILED IN TERMS OF HOW LONG THE VARIATIONS THAT DIFFERENT SUBJECTS EXPERIENCED AS WELL AS HOW TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF STRESS HORMON CORTIS ALL THAT'S RELEASED AS A CONSEQUENTS OF THE COLD WATER AND WE WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT COMPOUND SUPPLEMENTS THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE IN ORDER TO INCREASE THEIR LEVELS OF DOPAMINE SHOULD THEY CHOOSE BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO

AND PETASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR  TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOES ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF

WILL BE SPEAKING AT IT'S CALLED RETHINK EDUCATION THE BIOLOGY OF LEARNING REIMAGINING LEARNING THROUGH NURO SCIENCE AND AT THIS EVENT I WILL BE SPEAKING THERE WILL BE OTHER SPEAKERS AS WELL AND I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT NUR PLASTICITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS FOR TEACHING AND FOR LEARNING I WILL DESCRIBE WHAT I CALL THE PLASTICITY SUPERPROTOCALL THAT INCORPORATES ALL OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT RAPID LEARNING EFFICIENT LEARNING AND THE BEST WAYS TO TEACH AND LEARN ITS GEARE TOWARDS EDUCATORS OF ALL KINDS IT IS ZERO COST SO PLEACE FEEL FREE TO SIGN UP THE EVENT IS SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE AT THREE P M EASTERN YOU CAN FIND THE REGISTRATION LINK IN THE CAPTION FOR THIS EPISODE SO LET'S TALK ABOUT DOPAMINE MOST PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF DOPAMINE AND WE HEAR ALL THE TIME NOW ABOUT DOPAMINE HITS BUT ACTUALLY THERE'S NO SUCH THING OF IS A DOPAMINE HIT AND ACTUALLY THE WAY THAT YOUR BODY USES DOPAMINE IS TO HAVE A BASE LINE LEVEL OF DOPAMINE MEANING AN AOUNT OF DOPAMINE THAT CIRCULATING IN YOUR BRAIN EN BODY ALL THE TIME AND THAT TURNS OUT TO BE IMPORTANT FOR HOW YOU FEEL GENERALLY WHETHER NOT YOU'RE IN A GOOD MOOD MOD EVATED ET CETERA AND YOU ALSO CAN EXPERIENCE PEAKS IN DOPAMINE ABOVE BASE LINE THIS HAS A VERY SPECIFIC NAME IN THE NEROBIOLOGY LITERATURE SO CALLED  TONIC AND PHASIC RELEASE OF DOPAMINE AND I'LL EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANS IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES BUT IF YOU REMEMBER NOTHING ELSE FROM THIS EPISODE PLEASE REMEMBER THIS THAT WHEN YOU EXPERIENCE SOMETHING OR YOU CRAVE SOMETHING REALLY DESIRABLE REALLY EXCITING TO YOU VERY PLEASURABLE WHAT HAPPENS AFTERWARDS IS YOUR BASE LINE LEVEL OF DOPAMINE DROPS KA SO THESE PIKES IN DOPAMNE THEY INFLUENCE HOW MUCH DOPAMINE WILL GENERALLY BE CIRCULATING AFTERWARD AND YOU MIGHT THINK O A BIG PIK AND DOPAMINE AFTER THAT I'M GOING A FEEL EVEN BETTER BECAUSE I JUST HAD THIS GREAT EVENT NOT THE CASE WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS IS THAT YOUR BASELINE LEVEL OF DOPAMINE DROPS AND I WILL EXPLAIN THE PRECISE MECHANISM FOR THAT  IN THE NERL SCIENCE LITERATURE WE REFER TO THIS AS TONIC AND PHASIC RELEASE OF DOPAMINE TONIC BEING THE LOW LEVEL BASE LINE THAT'S ALWAYS THERE CIRCULATING RELEASED INT YOUR BRAIN ALL THE TIME AND THEN PHASIC THESE PEAKES THAT RIDE ABOVE THAT BASELINE AND THOSE TWO THINGS INTERACT AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT I'MN TO TEACH YOU THE UNERLINE NEUROBOLOGY BUT EVEN IF YOU HAVE NO BACKGROUND IN BIOLOGY IVE PROMISE TO MAKE IT ALL CLEAR ALL EXPLAIN THE TERMS IN WHAT THEY MEAN AND I'M EXCITE TO TEACH YOU ABOUT DOPAMINE BECAUSE DOPAMINE HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH HOW YOU FEEL RIGHT NOW AS YOUR LISTENING TO THIS IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH HOW YOU WILL FEEL AN HOUR FROM NOW HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH YOUR LEVEL OF MOTIVATION AND YOUR LEVEL OF DESIRE AND YOUR WILLINGNESS TO PUSH THROUGH EFFORT IF EVER YOU'VE INTERACTED WITH SOMEBODY WHO JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY DRIVE THEY'VE GIVEN UP ORS YOU'VE INTERACT WITH SOMEBODY WHO SEEMS TO HAVE ENDLESS DRIVE AND ENERGY WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT THERE IN THOSE TWO CIRCUMSTANCES IS WITHOUT QUESTION A DIFFERENCE IN THE LEVEL OF DOPAMINE CIRCULATING IN THEIR SYSTEM THERE WILL BE OTHER FACTORS TOO BUT THE LEVEL OF DOPAMINE IS THE PRIMARY DETERMINANT OF HOW MOTIVATED WE ARE HOW EXCITED WE ARE HOW OUTWARD FACING WE ARE AND HOW WILLING WE ARE TO LEAN INTO LIFE AND PURSUE THINGS DOPAMINE IS WHAT WE CALL A NEUROMODULATOR NEUROMODULATORS ARE DIFFERENT THAN NERO TRANSMITTERS NOR TRANSMITTERS ARE INVOLVED IN THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN NURONS NERVE CELLS AND NOR TRANSMITTERS TEND TO MEDIATE LOCAL COMMUNICATION JUST IMAGINE TWO PEOPLE TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER AT A CONCERT THAT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THEM IS ANALOGOUS TO THE COMMUNICATION CARRIED OUT BY NEURO TRANSMITTERS WHEREAS NEURO MODULATORS INFLUENCE THE COMMUNICATION OF MANY NURANTS IMAGINE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE DANCING WHERE IT'S A CORDINATED DANCE INVOLVING TEN OR TWENTY OR HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE NEUROMODULATORS ARE CORDINATING THAT DANCE IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT DOPAMINE RELEASE CHANGES THE PROBABILITY THAT CERTAIN NURL CIRCUITS WILL BE ACTIVE AND THAT OTHER NERL CIRCUITS WILL BE INACTIVE SO IT MODULATES A BUNCH OF THINGS ALL AT ONCE AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO POWERFUL IT SHIFTING NOT JUST ARE LEVELS OF ENERGY BUT ALSO ARE MIN SET ALSO OUR FEELINGS OF WEATHER NOT WE CAN OR CANNOT ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING SO HOW DOES DOPAMINE WORK AND WHAT DOES IT DO WHILL FIRST OF ALL IT IS NOT JUST RESPONSIBLE FOR PLEASURE IT IS REPONSIBLE FOR MOTIVATION AND DRIVE PRIMARILY AT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL LEVEL ALSO FOR CRAVING THOSE THREE THINGS ARE SORT OF THE SAME MOTIVATION DRIVE INCRAVING IT ALSO CONTROLS TIME PERCEPTION A WE WILL GET DEEP INTO HOW DOPAMING CAN MODULATE TIME PERCEPTION AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT EVERYBODY BE ABLE TO ACCESS INCREASES IN DOPAMIN AT DIFFERENT TIME SCALES THIS TURNS OUT TO BE IMPORTANT TO NOT END UP ADDICTED TO SUBSTANCES BUT IT ALSO TURNS OUT TO BE VERY IMPORTANT TO SUSTAIN EFFORT AND BE A HAPPY PERSON OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME WHICH I THINK MOST EVERYBODY WANTS IT CERTAINLY IS ADAPTIVE IN LIFE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT DOPAMIN IS ALSO VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR MOVEMENT I'LL EXPLAIN THE NERL CIRCUITS FOR DOPAMIN AND MINSET AND DOPAMINE IN MOVEMENT IN A MOMENT BUT IN DISEASES LIKE PARKANSINS OR LOUIS BODYES DEMENTIA WHICH IS SIMILAR TO PARKANSENCS IN MANY WAYS THERE IS A DEPLETION OR DEATH OF DOPAMING NERANS AT A PARTICULAR LOCATION IN THE BRAIN WHICH LEADS TO SHAKY MOVEMENTS CHALLENGES IN SPEAKING CHALLENGES IN PARTICULAR IN INITIATING MOVEMENT AND BECAUSE DOPAMING IS TO PLEADED ELSEWHERE TO PEOPLE WITH PARKANSONS AND LOUIS BOUHT IN LUEXCUSE ME LOUIS BODY DOMENTIA ALSO EXPERIENCE DROPS IN MOTIVATION AND AFFECT MEANING MOOD THEY TEND TO GET DEPRESSED AND SO ON WHEN THOSE PEOPLE AR PROPERLY TREATED THEY CAN NOT ALWAYS BUT THEY CAN RECOVER SOME FLUIDITY OF MOVEMENT SOME ABILITY TO INITIATE MOVEMENT AND ALMOST WITHOUT QUESTION THOSE PEOPLE FEEL BETTER PSYCHOLOGICALLY NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN MOVE BUT ALSO BECAUSE DOPAMEAN IMPACTS MOOD AND MOTIVATION SO WHAT ARE THE UNDERLYING NERAL CIRCUITS FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE NOT INTERESTED IN BIOLOGY AND SPECIFIC NOMINCLATE URE YOU CAN TURN OUT NOW IF YOU WANT BUT IT'S ACTALLY PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD YOU HAVE TUMAINE NERL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN THAT DOPAMINE USES IN ORDER TO EXERT ALL ITS EFFECTS THE FIRST ONE IS A PATHWAY THAT GOES FROM THIS AREA IN THE WHAT'S CALLED THE VENTUAL TAGMENTUM THATS A FANCY BUT VENTRAL DISTMEANS BOTTOM AND TAGMENTUM ACHLLY MEANS FLOOR SO IT'S AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BRAIN AND ITS THE VENTUAL PART OF THE FLOOR SO ITS REALLY LOW IN THE BACK THE BRAIN THE VENTUAL TAGMENTUM AND IT GOES FROM THE VENTUAL TAGMENTUM TO WHAT'S CALLED THE VENTUAL STRIATUM AND THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEC NOT ATS A LOT OF LANGUAGE BUT BASICALLY WHAT WE CALL THIS IS THE MESO CORTICAL LIMBIC PATHWAY THIS IS THE PATHWAY BY WHICH DOPAMINE INFLUENCES MOTIVATION DRIVE AND CRAVING IT INVOLVES STRUCTURES THAT SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF BEFORE THINGS LIKE NUCLIA SECUMBENS AND THE PREFRONTAL QUARTECS THIS IS THE PATHWAY THAT REALLY GETS TO SR PTED IN ADDICTIONS WHERE IN PARTICULAR DRUGS THAT INFLUENCE THE RELEASE OF DOPOMINE LIKE COCANUM AT THEMPHEDAMI WILL TALK ABOUT THOSE DRUGS TO DAY THEY TAP INTO THIS PATHWAY BUT IF YOU ARE PURSUING A PARTNER A BOYFRON AR GIRL FRIEND IF YOUR PURSUING A DEGREE IN SCHOOL IF YOURE PURSUING A FINISH LINE IN A RACE YOU ARE TAPPING IN TO THE SO CALLED MESO CUARTICA LIMBIC PATHWAY THIS IS THE CLASSIC REWARD PATHWAY IN ALL MAMELS THE OTHER PATHWAY EMERGES FROM AN AREA IN THE BRAIN CALLED THE SUBSTANTIAN NIGRA SO CALLED BECAUSE THE SELLS IN THAT AREA ARE DARK AND THE SUBSTANTIAL NIGRA CONNECTS TWO AN AREA OF THE BRAIN CALLED THE DORSAL STRIATUM THIS IS NOT SURPRISINGLY CALL THE NIGRO STRIATAL PATHWAY FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE NEVER DONE ANY NURONATOMYO MY TEACH YOUAL TRIC RIGHT NOW EVERYTHING IN NURONATAMY THE FIRST PART OF A WORD TELLS YOU WEAR THE NURON'S ARE AND THEN THE SECOND PART TELLS YOU WHERE THEY ARE CONNECTING TO SO WHENISING NIGRO STRIATAL PATHWAY MEANS THAT THE NURONS ARE INSUBSTANTIAL NIGRA AND THEY CONNECT TO THE STRIATUM NIGROSTRITAL PATHWAY SO WHILE IT'S A LOT OF LANGUAGE THERE IS SOME LOGIC THERE OK SO WEE GOT THESE TWO PATHWAYS ONE MAINLY FOR MOVEMENT RIGHT THIS IS THE SUBSTANTIAL NIGRA TO DORSAL STRIATUM AND WE'VE GOT THIS OTHER PATHWAY THE SO CALLED MESO CUARTICAL LIMBI PATHWAY THAT'S FOR REWARD REINFORCEMENT AND MOTIVATION I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THAT THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER THE TWO PATHWAYS IN DETAIL THAT'S FINE BUT PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THERE ARE TWO PATHWAYS BECAUSE THAT TURNS OUT TO BE IMPORTANT LATOR NOW THE OTHER THINGS TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT DOPOMINE IS THAT THE WAY THAT DOPEMIN IS RELEASED IN THE BRAIN AND BODY CAN DIFFER MEANING IT CAN BE VERY LOCAL OR IT CAN BE MORE BROAD NOW MOST OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD OF SCYNAPS AS SYNAPSES OF THE LITTLE SPACES BETWEEN NURONS AND BASICALLY NURON'S NERVE CELLS COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER BY MAKING EACH OTHER ELECTRICALLY ACTIVE OR BY MAKING EACH OTHER LESS ELECT ELECTRICALLY ACTIVE SEERS HOW THIS WORKS YOU CAN IMAGINE ONE NERVE CELL AND ANOTHER NERVE CELL WITH LOTL GAP BETWEEN THEM WILL SYNAPS AND THE WAY THAT ONE NERVE CELL CAUSES THE NEXT NERVE CELL TO FIRE WHAT WE CALL FIRE REALLY MEANS TO BECOME ELECTRICALLY ACTIVE IS THAT IT VOMITS OUT THESE LITTLE PACKETS WHAT WE CALL VESTICALS THEIRE LITTLE BUBBLES FILLED WITH A CHEMICAL WHEN THAT CHEMICAL ENTERS THE SCYNAPS IT SOME OF IT DOCKS OR PARKS ON THE OTHER SIDE IN THE OTHER NURON AND BY VIRTUE OF ELECTRICAL CHANGES IN THE WHAT WE CALL THE POST CYNAPTIC NURON THAT CHEMICAL WILL MAKE THAT NURON MORE ELECTRICALLY ACTIVE OR LESS ELECTRICALLY ACTIVE DOPAMINE CAN DO THAT LIKE ANY OTHER NURO TRANSMITTER A NUROMODULATOR SO IT CAN HAVE ONE NURON INFLUENCE ANOTHER NURON BUT DOPAMIE CAN ALSO ENGAGE IN WHAT'S CALLED VOLUME METRIC RELEASE VOLUMECTRIC RELEASE IS LIKE A GIANT VOMIT THAT GETS OUT TO F IFTY OR A HUNDRED OR EVEN THOUSANDS OF CELLS SO THERE'S LOCAL RELEASE WHAT WE CALL SYNAPTIC RELEASE AND THEN THERE'S VOLUMETRIC RELEASE SO VOLUMETRIC RELEAE LIKE DUMPING ALL THIS DOPAMINE OUT INTO THE SYSTEM SO DOPAMINE IS INCREDIBLE BECAUSE IT CAN CHANGE THE WAY THAT OURE NURL CIRCUITS WORK AT A LOCAL SCALE AND AT VERY BROAD SCALE AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN TOOLS LIKE HOW DO I GET MORE DOPAMINE LET ME TELL YOU THIS PART IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU WORE TO TAKE A DRUG OR SUPPLEMENT THAT INCREASES YOUR LEVEL OF DOPAMINE YOU ARE INFLUENCING BOTH THE LOCAL RELEASE OF DOPAMINE AND VOLUMETRIC RELEASE THIS RELATES BACK TO THE BASELINE OF DOPAMINE AND THE BIG PEAK ABOVE BASE LINE AND THAT TURNS OUT TO BE IMPORTANT AND I'LL JUST ALUDE TO WYITS IMPORTANT MANY DRUGS AND INDEED MANY SUPPLEMENTS THAT INCREASE DOPAMINE WELL ACTUALLY MAKE IT HARDER FOR YOU TO SUSTAIN DOPAMINE RELEASE OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND TO ACHIEVE THOSE PEAKS THAT MOST OF US ARE CRAVING WHEN WE ARE IN PURSUIT OF THINGS WHY BECAUSE IF YOU GET BOTH VOLUMETRIC RELEASE THE DUMPING OUT OF DOPAMINE EVERYWHERE AND YOUR GETTING LOCAL RELEASE WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PEAK AND BASE LINE IS LIKELY TO BE SMALLER AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT HOW SATISFYING OR EXCITING OR PLEASUREFUL A GIVEN EXPERIENCE IS DOESN'T JUST DEPEND ON THE HEIGHT OF THAT PEAK IT DEPENDS ON THE HEIGHT OF THAT PEAK RELATIVE TO THE BASE LINE SO IF YOU INCREASE THE BASE LINE AND YOU INCREASE THE PEAK YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ACHIEVE MORE AND MORE PLEASURE FROM THINGS I'LL TALK ABOUT HOW TO LEVERAGE THIS INFORMATION IN A LITTLE BIT BUT JUST INCREASING YOUR DOPAMINE YES IT WILL MAKE YOU EXCITED FOR ALL THINGS IT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL L VERY MOTIVATED BUT IT WILL ALSO MAKE THAT MOTIVATION VERY SHORT LIVED SO THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO INCREASE YOUR DOPAMINE THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO OPTIMIZE THIS PEAK TOBASE LINE RATIO FOR NOW WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT AS TWO MAIN NURL CIRCUITS ONE FOR MOVEMENT AND ONE FOR MOTIVATION AND CRAVING WITH DOPAMINE AND WE'VE TALKD ABOUT TWO MAIN MODES OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN NERONS WITH DOPAMINE ONE IS THIS LOCAL SYNAPTIC RELEASE ONE IS MORE VOLUMMETRIC RELEASE AND IN THE BACK YOUR MIND YOU CAN RELATE THIS BACK TO AGAIN THIS BASE LINE VERSES PEAKS ABOVE BASE LINE SO THAT'S A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WE WOULD CALL THE SPASIAL EFFECTS OR THE SPACIAL ASPECTS OF DOPAMINE I SAID THIS CONNECTS TO THAT THAT CONNECTS TO THIS YOU CAN GET LOCAL OR MORE BROAD VOLUMETRIC RELEASE WHAT ABOUT THE DURATION OF RELEASE OR THE DURATION OF ACTION FOR DOPAMINE WELL DOPAMINE IS UNIK AMONG CHEMICALS IN THE BRAIN BECAUSE DOPAMINE UNLIKE A LOT OF CHEMICALS IN THE BRAIN WORKS THROUGH WHAT ARE ALLED GE PROTINE COUPLED RECEPTORS AND FOR THOSE WHO YOU THERE ABOUT TO PASS OUT FROM THE AMOUNT OF DETAIL JUST HANGING THERE WITH ME ITS REALLY NOT COMPLICATED THEIR TWO WAYS THAT NURONS CAN COMMUNICATE ER MAINLY TO ITS THERE ARE A THIRD AND FOURTH BUT MOSTLY NURONS COMMUNICATE BY TO MODES ONE ARE WHAT WE CALL FAST ELECTRICAL SYNAPSES IONATROPIC CONDUCTION I YOU ON' EAN TO KNWHAT THAT MEANS BUT BASICALLY ONE NURON ACTIVATES ANOTHER NURON AND LITTLE HOLES OPEN UP IN THAT NURON AND IONS RUSH IN SODIUM IS THE MAIN ION SALT BY WHICH ONE NURON INFLUENCES THE ELECTRIC ELECTIVITY OF ANOTHER NUROM BECAUSE SODIUM IONS CONTAIN A CHARGE AYE THERE R OTHER THINGS LIKE CHLORIDE AND POTASSIUM YOUR INCEDN LOOKING THE EP JUST LOOK UP IONIC CONDUCTANCES IN THE ACTION POTENTIAL OR I COULD DO A POST ON IT SOME TIME AND WE COAN GO IN TO DETAIL BUT JUST UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN NURONS WANT TO INFLUENCE EACH OTHER THEY CAN DO IT BY WAY OF THIS FAST IONATROPIC CONDUCTION THIS IS A REALLY QUICK WAY FOR ONE NURON TO INFLUENCE THE NEXT DOPAMINE DOESN'T COMMUNICATE THAT WAY DOAMIINE IS SLOWER IT WORKS THROUGH WHAT ARE CALLED G PROTINE COUPLED RECEPTORS SO WHAT HAPPENS IS DOPAMINE IS RELEASED IN THESE LITTLE VETICLES THAT I'VE MENTION BEFORE GET VOMITED OUT INTO THE SYNAPS SOME OF THAT DOPAMINE WILL BIND TO THE SO CALL POSSINAPTIC NURONE'LL BIND TO THE NEXT NURON AND THEN IT SETS OFF A CASCADE IT'S KINDING LIKE A BUCKET BRIGADE OF ONE THING GETTING HANDED OFF TO THE NEXT TO THE NEXT TO THE NEXT IT'S G PROTINE COUPLED RECEPTORS AND AINTIME YOU HEAR ABOUT THESE G P CIARS IR G PROTINE COUPLED RECEPTORS PAY ATTENTION BECAUSE THEIR REALLY INTERESTING THEIR SLOW BUT THEY ALSO CAN HAVE MULTIBLE CASCADES OF EFFECTS THEY CAN IMPACT EVEN GENE EXPRESSION AT SOME LEVEL THEY CAN CHANGE WHAT A CELL ACTUALLY BECOMES THEY CAN CHANGE HOW WELL OR HOW POORLY THAT CELL WILL RESPOND TO THE SAME SIGNAL IN THE FUTURE SO DOPAMINE WORKS THROUGH THIS SLOWER PROCESS THESE G PROTINE COUPLED RECEPTORS AND SO IT'S EFFECTS TEND TO TAKE A WHILE IN ORDER TO OCCUR THIS ASPECT OF DOPAMINE TRANSMISSION IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT NOW UNDERSCORES TWO THINGS ONE THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS FOR DOPAMINE TO COMMUNICATE ONE FOR MOVEMENT ONE FOR MOTIVATION AND CRAVING THERE'S TWO SPACIAL SCALES AT WHICH DOPAMINE CAN OPERATE SCYNAPTICALLY OR VOLUMETRICALLY AND DOPAMINE CAN HAVE SLOW EFFECTS REALLY SLOW EFFECTS OR EVEN VERY LONG LASTING EFFECTS AND EVEN CAN CONTROL GENE EXPRESSION CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THE WAY THAT SELLS BEHAVE ONE THING THAT'S NOT OFTEN DISCUSSED ABOUT DOPAMINE BUT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO KNOW IS THAT DOPAMINE DOESN'T WORK ON ITS OWN NURONS THAT RELEASE DOPAMINE CO RELEASE GLUDOMATE GLUDIMATE IS A NURO TRANSMITTER AND IT'S A NURO TRANSMITTER THAT IS EXCITATORY MEANING IT STIMULATES NURONS TO BE ELECTRICALLY ACTIVE SO NOW EVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW ANY CELL BIOLOGY SCHOULD START TO GAIN A PICTURE THAT DOPAMINE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MOVEMENT MOTIVATION AND DRIVE IT DOES THAT THROU R TO PATHWAYS BUT ALSO THE DOPAMINE STIMULATES ACTION IN GENERAL BECAUSE IT RELEASES THES EXCIDATORY NOR TRANSMITTER TENDS TO MAKE CERTAIN NURONS THAT ARE NEAR BY OR EVEN THAT ARE FAR AWAY BECAUSE OF ALL EMETRIC RELEASE IT TENDS TO MAKE THOSE MORE ACTIVE SO DOPAMINE IS REALLY STIMULATING AND INDEED WE SAY THAT DOPAMINURGIC TRANSMISSION ARE DOPAMINE TENDS TO STIMULATE SIMPATHETIC AROUSAL SYMPATHETIC DOESN'T HAVEANGTHIN TO A SYMPATHY ITS JUST SIMPLY MEANS THAT IT TENDS TO INCREASE OUR LEVELS OF ALERTNESS IT TENDS TO BRING AN ANIMAL OR A HUMAN INTO A STATE OF MORE ALERTNESS READINESS AND DESIRE TO PURSUE THINGS OUTSIDE THE CONFINES OF ITS SKIN SO FI WERE TO JUST PUT A REALLY SIMPLE MESSAGE AROUND DOPAMNE IT WOULD BE THERE'S A MOLECULINE YOUR BRAINE IN BODY THAT WHEN RELEASED TENDS TO MAKE YOU LOOK OUTSIDE YOURSELF PURSUE THINGS OUTSIDE YOURSELF AND TO CRAVE THINGS OUTSIDE YOURSELF THE PLEASURE THAT ARRIVES FROM ACHIEVING THINGS ALSO INVOLVES DOPAMINE BUT IS MAINLY THE CONSEQUENCE OF OTHER MOLECULES BUT IF EVER YOU FELT LETHARGIC AND LIK JUST LAZY AND YOU HAD NO MOTIVATION OR DRIVE THAT'S A LOW DOPAMINE STATE IF EVER YOU FELT REALLY EXCITED MOTIVATED EVEN IF YOUR LITTLE SCARED TO DO SOMETHING MAYBEU DID YOUR FIRST SKYDIVE OR YOUR ABOUT TO DO YOUR FIRST SKYDIVE WERE OU ABOUT TO DO SOME PUBLIC SPEAKING YOU REALLY DON'T WANT A SCREW IT UP YOU ARE IN A HIGH DOPAMINE STATE DOPAMIE IS A UNIVERSAL CURRENCY IN ALL MAMMELS BUT ESPECIALLY IN HUMANS FOR MOVING US TOWARD GOALS AND HOW MUCH DOPAMINE IS IN OUR SYSTEM AT ANY ONE TIME COMPARED TO HOW MUCH DOPAMINE WAS IN OUR SYSTEM A FEW MINUTES AGO AND HOW MUCH WE REMEMBER ENJOYING A PARTICULAR EXPERIENCE OF THE PAST THAT DICTATES YOUR SO CALLED QUALITY OF LIFE AND YOUR DESIRE TO PURSUE THINGS THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT DOPAMINE IS A CURRENCY AND IT'S THE WAY THAT YOU TRACK PLEASURE IT'S THE WAY THAT YOU TRACK SUCCESS IT'S THE WAY THAT YOU TRAC WHETHER NOT YOU ARE DOING WELL OR DOING POORLY AND THAT IS SUBJECTIVE BUT IF YOUR DOPAMINE IS TOO LOW YOU WILL NOT FEEL MOTIVATED IF YOUR DOPAMINE IS REALLY HIGH YOU WILL FEEL MOTIVATED AND IF YOUR DOPAMIE IS SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE HOW YOU FEEL DEPENDS ON WEATHER NOT YOU HAD HIGHER DOPAMINE A FEW MINUTES AGO OR LOWER DOPAMINE THIS IS IMPORTANT YOUR EXPERIENCE OF LIFE AND YOUR LEVEL OF EMOTIVATION AND DRIVE DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH DOPAMINE YOU HAVE RELATIVE TO YOUR RECENT EXPERIENCE THIS IS AGAIN SOMETHING THAT'S JUST NOT ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE SIMPLE LANGUAGE OF DOPAMINE HITS  A SIMPLE WAY TO INVISION DOPAMINE HITS AS EVERY TIME YOU DO SOMETHING YOU LIKEYO TO PIECE A CHOCOLATE DOPAMINE HIT YOU LOOK A YOUR INSURGEMT DOPAMINE HIT YOU SEE SOMEWHEN YOU LIKE DOPAMINE HIT YOU KNOW ALL THESE THING S DESCRIBED AS DOPAMINE HITS NEGLECT THE FACT THAT IF YOU SCROLL SOCIAL MEDIUM YOU SEE SOMETHING YOU REALLY LIKE DOPAMING HIT SURE THERE'S AN INCREASE IN DOPAMIN BUT THEN YOU GET TO SOMETHING ELSE AND YOU KNOW NOT THAT INTERESTING HOWEVER HAD YOU ARRIVED AT THAT SECOND THING FIRST YOU MIGHT THINK THAT IT WAS REALY INTERESTING IF YOU HAD ARIVED TO THAT SECOND INSTERGRAMPOST THREE DAYS LATER OR FOUR DAYS LATER YOU MIGHT FIND IT EXTREMELY INTERESTING AGAIND HOW MUCH DOPAMING YOU EXPERIENCE FROM SOMETHING DEPENDS ON YOUR BASE LINE LEVEL OF DOPAMING WHEN YOU ARRIVE THERE AND YOUR PREVIOUS DOPAMINE PEAKES OCAI THAT SUPERIMPORTANT UNDERSTAND AND IT'S COMPLETELY NEGLECTED BY THE GENERAL LANGUAGE OF DOPAMING HITS THIS IS WHY WHEN YOU REPEATEDLY ENGAGE IN SOMETHING THAT YOU ENJOY YOU ARE THRESHOLD FOR ENJOYMENT GOES UP AND UP AND UP SOME WANE TO TALK ABOUT THAT PROCESS AND I WANT TO EXPLAIN HOW THAT PROCESS WORKS BECAUSE IF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT PROCESS AND YOU UNDERSTAND SOME OF THESE SCHEDULES AND CANETICS AS WE CALL THEM AROUND DOPAMING YOU WILL BE IN A TERRIFIC POSITION TO USE ANY DOPAMING ENDHANCING TOOLS THAT YOU DECIDE TO USE YOU'LL BE IN AN EXCELLENT POSITION TO MOTULATE AND CONTROL YOUR OWN DOPAMING RELEASE FOR OPTIBLE MOTIVATION AND DRIVE I REALIZE THAT WAS A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF DOPAMING SOME OF LIKE ON TO MAKE YOU DRINK FROM THE FIREHOSE OF DOPAMING BIOLOGY HOWEVER I REALIZE THAT SOME PEOPLE PROBABLY WANT EVEN MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF DOPAMING TRANSMISSION  YOU'R INTERESTED IN THAT I'LL POST A LINK TO A ABSOLUTELY STELLA REVIEW THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN NATURE REVIEWS IN OR A SCIENCE CALLED SPACIAL EN TEMPORAL SCALES OF DOPAMINE TRANSMISSION IT IS QUITE DETAILED BUT THEY HAVE BEAUTIFUL DIAGRAMS AND CAN WALK YOU THROUGH ALL THE THINGS THAT I JUST DESCRIBED AND GET INTO EVEN MORE DETAIL WILLPUT A LINK TO THAT IN THE CAPTION ON YOU TO RIGHT NOW I WANT A SHARE WITH YOU TO ANECDOTES ONE FOR MY OWN LIFE AND ONE FROM SOME FAIRLY RECENT HISTORY THAT ILLUSTRATE SOME OF THE COR BIOLOGY OF DOPAMINE AND HOW PROFOUNDLY IT CAN SHAPE OUR EXPERIENCE THE FIRST ONE IS A REALLY TRAGIC SITUATION THAT OCCURRED THIS WAS IN THE EIDIES THERE WAS A OUTBREAK OF WHAT LOOKED LIKE PARKINSONIAN SYMPTOMS IN A YOUNG POPULATION SO MANY OF YOU HEARD OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE PARKINSON'S DISEASE IS A DISEASE IN WHICH PEOPLE A INITIALLY START TO QUAKE A CAN'T GENERATE SMOOTH MOVEMENTS THE HAVE ISSUES WITH SPEECH SOMETIMES COGNITION AS WELL THERE ARE EXAMPLES LIKE MICHAEL JE FOX WHICH ARE EARLY ONSET PARKINSON'S TYPICALLY IT HIDS PEOPLE ALOBIT LATER IN LIFE THERE'S A GENETIC COMPONENT AM BUT THERE IS THIS QUESTION AND THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN THIS QUESTION WHETHER NOT CERTAIN LIFESTYLE FACTORS CAN ALSO CREATE PARKINSONS AND SOME YEARS AGO THERE WAS IT SITUATION WHERE  LABORATORY STREET LABORATORIES OM ELICIT LABORATORIES WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE A DRUG CALLED M P P P WHICH IS AN OPIOID LIKE COMPOUND IT'S A BIT LIKE HEROINE AND HEROINE ATTICS SEEKING HEROINE WENT OUT AND BOUGHT WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS M P P P UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS NOT M P P P AD IT WOULD AVE BEEN TRAGIC IF IT WAS ANYWAY BECAUSE THEY WERE DRUG ATTICS BUT WHAT THEY ENDED UP TAKING TURNED OUT TO BE A LOT WORSE WHAT THEY ENDED UP TAKING WAS M P P P AN M P P P CAN ARISE IN THE SYNTHESIS OF M P P P SO SOME ONE IN A LAB SOME PLACE THIS WAS MAINLY IN THE CENTRAL VALEY IN CALIFORNIA BUT ELSEWHERE AS WELL SOMEBODY CREATED M P P P AND WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING WAS A LARGE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE OPIOID ATTICS BECAME COMPLETELY BOXED IN PERALYZED COULDN'T SPEAK COULDN'T BLINK COULDN'T DO ANYTHING COULDN'T FUNCTION COULDN'T MOVE SO BOTH ASPECTS OF DOPOMINE TRANSMISSION WERE DISRRUPTEDE THEY HAD NO MOTIVATION IN DRIVE THEY COULDN'T GENERATE ANY MOVEMENT OF ANY KIND THEY WERE LITERALLY LOCKED IN FROZEN AND SADLY THIS IS IRREVERSIBLE IT'S IRREVERSIBLE BECAUSE WHAT M P P P DOES IS IT KILLS THE DOAMAGERGIC NURONS OF THE SUBSTANTIAL NIGRA THAT NIGROSTRADO PATHWAY THAT'S INVOLVED IN GENERATING MOVEMENT AND IT KILLS THE DOPOMANURGIC NURONS OF THE SO CALLED MISO CORTICA LIMIC PATHWAY I WAS IN COLLEGE WHEN THIS WHOLE M P P P THING HAPPENED AND I REMEMBER HEARING THI STORY AT THE TIME I HAD NO UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT IS TO HAVE VERY HIGH LEVELS OF DOPOMINE OR EXTREMELY TEPLEADED LEVELS OF DOPAMIN THERE WAS NO REASON WHY I SHOULD HAVE THAT UNDERSTANDING I MEAN OF COURSE I HAD EXPERIENCED DIFFERENT PLEASURES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND I'VE HAD LOS IN MY LIFE BUT NOTHING TO THE EXTREME THAT I'M ABOUT TO DISCUSS I GOT JARDIA AND JARDIA IS A STOMACH BUG THAT IF ANY OF YOU EVER HAD IT IT IS TERRIBLE YOT IT'S TERRIBLE DIAREA YOU END UP VERY DEHYDRATED VERY QUICKLY YOU DROP A TON OF WEIGHT AND IT IS EXTREMELY UNPLEASANT END OF GOING TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM I BEGGED THEM FOR SOMETHING TO STOP UP MY GUTS AND THEY GAVE IT TO ME THEY PUT A SAILING LINE IN TO REHYDRATE ME AND THEY INJECTED SOMETHING INTO THE SAILING BAG AND WITHIN MINUTES I FELT MORE SADNESS MORE OVERWHELMING SENSE OF DEPRESSION BASILY LOWER THAN I'D EVER FELT IN MY ENTIRALIZE IT WAS ABSOLUTELY PROFOUND I I WAS CRYING ENDLESSLY WITHOUT KNOWING WHY I WAS DRAWING I WAS MISERABLE AND I ASKED THEM WHAT DID YOU INJECT AND THEY SAID WE INJECTED THORZINE THORSINE IS AN ANTISYCOTIC DRUG 'S ISHUL USED TO BLOCK DOPOMINE RECEPTORS IT'S WHAT'S GIV N TO PEOPLE WHO HAVESKIZOPHRENIA OFTEN IS GIVEN TO PEOPOEWSKIZOPHRENIA BECAUSE SKHIZAOPHRENIA INVOLVES AMONG OTHER THINGS ELEVATED LEVELS OF DOPAMIE IT WAS HORRIBLE THE EXPERIENCE OF IT WAS MISERABLE UNLIKE ANYTHING I'D EVER EXPERIENCED AND SO I ACTUALLY SAID TO THEM WHAT DID YOU GIVE ME THEY SAID THORZINE AND I SAID YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME EL DOPA YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME SOMETHING TO GET MY DOPAMI LEVELS BACK UP AGAIN AND THEY DID THEY GAVE ME AN INJECTION OF EL DOPA INTO THE BAG WHENT STRAINED MY BLOODSTREAM AND WITHIN MINUTES I FELT FINE AGAIN IT WAS INCREDIBLE AND IT REALLY OPENED UP MY MIND AND MY EXPERIENCE TO WHAT IT IS TO HAVE ABSOLUTELY PLOMITED LEVELS OF DOPAMIN THERE'S NOTHING MORE MISERABLE THAN THAT I'LL TELL YOU AND THESE POOR SOULS WHO HAD THIS EMP TPI EXPERIENCE UNFORTUNATELY THEY COULDN'T RECOVER THOSE CELLS PEOPLE HO HAVE SEVERE PARKINSONS ARE STRUGGLING WITH THIS AS WELL BECAUSE IN PARKINSONS AND IN LOUIS BODY DOMENSIA THE DOPAMAN URGENT NERONS OFTEN DIE IT'S NOT JUST A PROBLEM WITH THOSE NERONS RELEASING ENOUGH DOPAMING LATER WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME APPROACHES TO MAINTAINING DOPAMEN URGET NERON HEALTH AND THINGS THAT WE CAN ALL DO FOR THAT BUT I WILL TELL YOU THESE DOPAMINERONS THAT WE ALL HAVE ARE VERY PRECIOUS FOR MOVEMENT AND MOOD AND MOTIVATION HAVING EXPERIENCED WHAT IT IS TO HAVE VERY VERY LOW LEVELS OF DOPAMIN ORDE IN THIS CASE TO HAVE MY DOPAMINE RECEPTORS BLOCKED AH THFROM THORZIN WAS I OPENING TO SAY THE LEAST AND HAS GIVEN ME THE TREMENDOUS SENSITIVITY TO THE FACT THAT DOPAMINE IS PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL MOLECULES THAT ANY OF US HAS INCIDE OF US AND THE ONE THAT WE OUGHT TO ALL THING VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT HOW WE LEVERAGE BECAUSE WHILE MOST EXPERIENCES AND MOST THINGS THAT WE DO AND TAKE AND EAT AND ETCETERA WON'T CREATE ENORMOUS HIES AND ENORMOUS LOS IN DOPAMINE EVEN SUBTLE FLUCTUATIONS IN DOPAMINE REALLY SHAPE AURE PERCEPTION OF LIFE AND WHAT WERE CAPABLE OF AND HOW WE FEEL AND SO WE WANT O GUARD THOSE WHEND WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND THEM SO LET'S LEAN INTO THAT UNDERSTANDING ABOUT DOPAMINE AND THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME TOOLS THAT WE CAN ALL USE TO LEVERAGE DOPAMINE IN ORDER TO KEEP THAT BASE LINE IN THE APPROPRIATE HEALTHY PLACE AND STILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE PEAKS IN DOPAMINE BECAUSE THOSE AFTER ALL ARE SOME OF WHAT MAKES LIFE RICH AND WORTH LIVING SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BASE LINE OF DOPAMINE THAT WE ALL HAVE AND THE PEAKS IN DOPAMINE THAT WE ALL CAN ACHIEVE THROUGH DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES AND THINGS THAT WE INJEST ALL OF US HAVE DIFFERENT BASELINE LEVELS OF DOPAMING SOME OF THIS IS SURE TO BE GENETIC SOME PEOPLE JUST SIMPLY RIDE AT A LEVEL A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THEL BIT MORE EXCITED THERE LITTLE BIT MORE MOTIVATED OR MAY BE THERE A LOT MORE EXCITED OR LOT MORE MOTIVATED SOME PEOPLE ARE LOMELLOWER SOME PEOPLE ARE LESS EXCITABLE AND SOME OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT DO PAMINE DOESN'T ACT ALONE DOPAMINE HAS CLOSE COUSINS OR FRIENDS IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND I'LL JUST NAME OFF A FEW OF THOSE CLOSE COUSINS AND FRIENDS EPINFREN ALSO CALL THE DRENALIN IS THE MAIN CHEMICAL DRIVER OF ENERGY WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ANYTHING AT ALL UNLESS WE HAVE SOME LEVEL OF EPINEFRAN IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY IT'S RELEASE FROM THE ADRENAL GLANDS WHICH RITE TO TOPARKIDNES ITS RELEASE FROM AN AREA OF THE BRAINSTEM CALLED LOCUS CERULIUS AND IT'S RELEASE TENDS TO WAKE UP NERAL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN AND WAKE UP VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BODIES PHYSIOLOGY AND GIVE US A READINESS SO SHE COME IS NO SURPRISE THAT DOPAMINE AN EPINEFREN ACEDRENALIN HANG OUT TOGETHER IN FACT EPINEFRAN AND A DRENALIN ARE ACTUALLY MANUFACTURED FROM DOPAMINE SO BYA CHEMICAL PATHWAY INVOLVING DOPAMIN JUST A BEAUTIFUL PATHWAY IF EVERI YOU WANT O LOOK AT UP YOU YOU JUST LOOK UP BILE CHEMISTRY OF DOPAMINE BUTWHAT YOU'LL FIND IS THAT EL DOPA IS CONVERTED INTO DOPAMINE DOPAMINE IS CONVERTED TO NOR ADRENALIN NOR EPINEFERAN ALSO CALLED AND NOR A DRENALIN NOR EPINEFRAN IS CONVERTED INTO ADRENALIN SO NOT ONLY ARE DOPAMINE AND EPINEFERAN ECEADRENALIN CLOSE COUSINS THEY ARE ACTUALLY FAMILY MEMBERS OCE THEIR CLOSELY RELATED AND I CAN O GET TOO DEEP INTO EPINEFRON TO DAY'NOTKING NOT TALK TOO MUCH ABOUT THOSE PATHWAYS BUT ANY TIME I'M TALKING ABOUT DOPAMINERGIC TRANSMISSION OR THAT YOUAVE A PIKAN DOPAMINE INEVITABLY THAT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE A PEAKE AND RELEASE OF EPINEFERANIS WELL WHAT DOPAMINE DOES IS DOPOMINE REALLY COLLERS THE  SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF AN ACTIVITY TO MAKE IT MORE PLEAISUREFUL TO MAKE IT SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT MORE OF EPINEFREN IS MORE ABOUT ENERGY EPINEFRON ALONE CAN BE FEAR PARALYSIS TRAMA NOT PHYSICAL PARALYSIS BUT MENTAL PARALYSIS YOU KNOWS FROZEN IN FEAR OR BEING TROMATIZED OR SCARED BUT THE ADDITION OF DOPAMINE TO THAT CHEMICAL COCTAL IF DOPAMINRS RELEASED IN THE BRAIN WELL THEN THAT EPINEFRAN BECOMES ONE OF EXCITEMENT CA AMUSING ABROAD BRUSH HERE BUT ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THAT DOPAMINE AND EPINEFERAN ECHEETAD ADRENALIN ARE FAMILY MEMBERS AND THEY TEND TO WORK TOGETHER LIKE A LITTLE GANG TO MAKE YOU SEEK OUT CERTAIN THINGS SO WHAT SORTS OF ACTIVITIES WHAT SORTS OF THINGS INCREASE DOPAMNE AND HOW MUCH DO THEY INCREASE DOPAMINE LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME TYPICAL THINGS THAT PEOPLE DO OUT THERE OR IN JEST OUT THERE THAT ARE KNOWN TO INCREASE DOPAMINE SO LET'S RECALL THAT YOU HAVE A BASE LINE LEVEL OF DOPAMINE AND THAT EVERYBODY DOES AND EVEN WITHIN A FAMILY YOU MIGHT HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE VERY EXCITABLE HAPPY AND MOTIVATED AND OTHERS WHO ARE LESS EXCITABLE HAPPIN NE MOD OVATED BUT YOUR LEVEL OF DOPAMINE HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THOSE CENATICS BUT ALSO WITH WHAT YOU'VE EXPERIENCED IN THE PREVIOUS DAYS AN THE PREVIOUS MONTHS AND SO ON WHEN YOU DO OR INJESTS CERTAIN THINGS YOUR LEVELS OF DOPAMINE WILL RISE ABOVE BASE LINE TRANSIENTLY AND DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU DO OR IN JEST IT WILL RISE EITHER MORE OR LESS AND IT WILL BE VERY BRIEF OR  LAST A LONG TINE SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE TYPICAL THINGS THAT PEOPLE TAKE AND DO AND EAT SOME ARE GOOD FOR US SOME ARE NOT GOOD FOR US AND LET'S ASK HOW MUCH DOPOMINE IS INCREASED ABOVE BASELINE NW OF COURSE THESE ARE AVERAGES BUT THESE ARE AVERAGES THATVE BEEN MEASURED IN SO CALL MICRODIALSO STUDIES IN ANIMALS SO ACTURY EXTRACTING FROM PARTICULAR BRANARIES HOW MUCH DOPOMI IS RELEASED OR FROM MEASURING THE SYRUM THE THE CIRCULATING LEVELS OF DOPAMINE IN HUMANS CHOCOLATE THEY DIDN'T LOOK AT MILK VERSES DARK CHOCOLATE BUT CHOCOLATE WILL INCREASE YOUR BASELINE LEVEL OF DOPAMINE ONE POINT FIVE TIMES SO IT'S A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN DOPAMINE IT'S TRANSIENT IT GOES AWAY AFTER A FEW MINUTES OR EVEN A FEW SECONDS I'LL EXPLAIN WHAT DETERMINES THE DURATION IN A MINUTE BUT ONE POINT FIVE TIMES FOR CHOCOLATE SEC BOTH THE PURSUIT OF SEC AND THE ACT OFE SEX INCREASES DOPOMINE TWO TIMES SO IT'S A DOUBLING ABOVE BASELINE NOW OF COURSE THERE'S GOING TO BE VARIATION THERE BUT THAT'S THE AVERAGE INCREASE IN BASELINE DOPAMNE CAUSED BY SEC LATER I WILL TALK ABOUT HOW THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE SO CALLED AROUSAL ART THE DIFFEREND ASPECTS OF SECTS BELIEVED OR NOT HAVE A DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT ON DOPAMINE BUT FOR NOW AS A GENERAL HENE OR ACTIVITY SEC DOUBLS THE AMOUNT OF DOPAMINE CIRCULATING IN YOUR BLOOD NICOTINE IN PARTICULAR NICOTINE THAT IS SMOKED CIGARETTES AND SO FORTH INCREASES DOPAMINE TWO AND A HALF TIMES ABOVE BASE LINE SO THERE'S A PIKE THAT GOES UP ABOVE BASELINE TWO AND A HALF TIMES HIGHER IT IS VERY SHORT LIVED ANY ONE WHOSE EVER BEEN A CHAIN SMOKER OR OBSERVED A CHAIN SMOKER UNDERSTANDS THAT THE INCREASE IN DOPAMINE FROM NICOTINE IS VERY SHORT LIVED COCANE WILL INCREASE THE LEVEL OF DOPAMINE IN THE BLOODSTREAM TWO AND A HALF TIMES ABOVE BASELINE AND AN PETAMINE ANOTHER DRUG THAT INCREASES DOPAMINE WILL INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DOPAMI IN THE BLOOD STREAM TEN TIMES ABOVE BASE LINE A TREMENDOUS INCREASE IN DOPAMINE EXERCISE NOW EXERCISE WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT IMPACT ON THE LEVEL LS OF DOPOMINE DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH SOMEBODY SUBJECTIVELY ENJOYS THAT EXERCISE SO F YOU'R SOMEBODY WHO LOVES RUNNING CHANCES ARE IT'S GOING TO INCREASE YOUR LEVELS OF DOPOMINE TWO TIMES ABOVE YOUR BASELINE NOT UNLIKE SECTS PEOPLE WHO DISLIKE EXERCISE WILL ACHIEVE LESS DOPOMINE INCREASE OR NO INCREASE IN DOPOMINE FROM EXERCISE AND IF YOU LIKE OTHER FORMS OF EXERCISE LIKE YOGER OR WEIT LIFTING OR SWIMMING OR WHAT HAVE YOU AGAIN IT'S GOING TO VARY BY YOUR SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF WHETHER NOT YOU ENJOY THAT ACTIVITY THIS IS IMPORTANT AND IT BRINGS US BACK TO SOMETHING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER REMEMBER THAT MISO CORTICA LIMBIC PATHWAY WELL THE CORTICAL PART IS IMPORTANT THE CORTICAL PART ACTUALLY HAS A VERY SPECIFIC PART WHICH IS YOUR PREFRONTAL QUARTECTS THE AREA OF YOUR FOREBRAIN THAT'S INVOLVED IN THINKING AND PLANNING AND INVOLVED IN ASSIGNING A RATIONAL EXPLANATION TO SOMETHING AND INVOLVED IN ASSIGNING A SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE TO SOMETHING I SO FOR INSTANT THE PENDENT I'M HOLDING RIGHT NOW SWHEN THESE PILOT VI FIVES THIT LOVE THESE PILOT VE FIVE THEY DON'T SPON TO THE PIGETS IT JUST HAVEN'T O LIKE THEM I LIKE THE WAY THAT THEY WRITE HOW THEY FEEL IF I SPENT ENOUGH TIME THINKING ABOUT OR TALKING ABOUT IT I COAN PROLY GET A DOPOMINE INCREASE JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS PILOT VE FIVE AND THAT'S NOT BECAUSE I HAVE THE PROPENSITY TO RELEASE DOPOMING EASILY IT'S THAT AS WE START TO ENGAGE WITH SOMETHING MORE AND MORE AND WHAT WE SAY ABOUT IT AND WHAT WE INCOURAGE OURSELF TO THINK ABOUT IT HAS A PROFOUND IMPACT ON IT'S REWARDING OR NON REWARDING PROPERTIES NOW IT'S NOT SIMPLY THE CASE THAT YOU CAN LIE TO YOURSELF AND YU CAN TELL YOURSELF I LOVE SOMETHING AND WHEN YOU DON'T REALLY LOVE IT AND IT WILL INCREASE DOPOMINE BUT WHAT'S BEEN FOUND OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS THAT IF PEOPLE JOURNAL ABOUT SOMETHING OR THEY PRACTISE A SOME FORM OF APPRECIATION FOR SOMETHING OR THEY THINK OF SOME ASPECT OF SOMETHING THAT THEY ENJOY THE AMOUNT OF DOPOMINE THAT THAT BEHAVIOR WILL EVOKE TENDS TO GO UP SO FOR PEOPLE THAT HATE EXERCISE YOU CAN THINK ABOUT SOME ASPEXT OF EXERCISE THAT YOU REALLY ENJOY HOWEVER I WILL CAUTION YOU AGAINST SAYING TO YOURSELF I HATE EXERCISE OR I HATE STUDYING OR I HATE THIS PERSON BUT I LOVE THE REWARD I GIVE MYSELF AFTERWARD LATER WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW REWARDS GIVEN AT AFTERWARD ACTUALLY MAKE THE SITUATION WORSE THEY WON'T MAKE YOU LIKE EXERCISE MORE OR STUDYING MORE THEY ACTUA WILL UNDERMINE THE DOPOMINE RELEASE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE OCCUR FOR THAT ACTIVITY SO CERTAIN THINGS CHEMICALS HAVE A UNIVERSAL EFFECT THEY MAKE EVERYBODY'S DOPOMING GO UP SO SOME PEOPLE LIKE CHACOLATE SOME PEOPLE DON'T OF COURSE BUT IN GENERAL IT HAS CAUSES THIS INCREASE IN DOPOMINE BUT SEX NICOTINE COCANE EMPHETAMINE THOSE THINGS CAUSE INCREASES IN DOPOMINE IN EVERYBODY THAT TAKES THEM THINGS LIKE EXERCISE STUDYING HARD WORK WORKING THROUGH A CHALLENGE IN A RELA TIONSHIP OR WORKING THROUGH SOMETHING HORRD OF ANY KIND THAT IS GOING TO BE SUBJECTIVE AS TO HOW MUCH DOPAMINE WILL BE RELEASED AND WE WILL RETURN TO THAT SUBJECTIVE COMPONENT IN A LITTLE BIT BUT NOW YOU HAVE A SENSE OF HOW MUCH DOPAMINE CAN BE EVOKED BY DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES AND BY DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES ONE THAT YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING ABOUT IS KAFFINE I'M CERTAINLY DRINKING MY KAFFING TO DAY AND I DO ENJOY KAFFINE AND A LIMITED A QUANTITIES I DRINK YEURBOMATE AND I DRINK COFFEE AND I LOVE IT DOES IT INCREASED DOPAMING WELL A LITTLE BIT KAFFINE WILL INCREASE DOPAMINE TO SOME EXTENT BUT IT IS PRETTY MODEST COMPARED TO THE OTHER THINGS THAT I DESCRIBE CHOCOLATE SEXANICTIN COKANE AND FEDEMING AND SO ON HOWEVER IS A REALLY INTERESTING PAPER PUBLISH IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THIS IS VOLCOW AT ALL YOU CAN LOOK IT UP IT'S VERY EASY TO FIND THEY SHOW THAT REGULAR INGESTION OF KAFFINE WHETHER NOTS FROM COFFEE OR OTHERWISE INCREASES UP REGULATION OF CERTAIN DOPAMINE RECEPTORS SO KAFFINE ACTUALLY MAKES YOU ABLE TO EXPERIENTES MORE OF DOPAMINES EFFECTS BECAUSE AS I MENTION BEFORE DOPAMINE IS VOMITED OUT INTO THE SYNAPS OR ITS RELEASE VOLUMETRICALLY BUT THEN HAS TO BIND SOME PLACE AND TRIGGER THOSE GEPROTING COUPLED RECEPTRS AND KAFFINE INCREASES THE NUMBER THE DENSITY OF THOSE GEPROTING COUPLED RECEPTORS NOW SITTING BACK AND THINKING ABOUT THAT YOU MIGHT THINOH YI YOU KNOWS SOMETIMES I'LL NOTICE PEOPLE AT LEAST IN THE OLD DAYS THAT IT USED TO BE A CIGARETTE AND A CUP OF COFFEE OR WHEN PEOPLE DRINK ALCOHOL OFTENTIMES THEY'LL SMOKE AND IT'S WELL KNOWN THAT DIFFERENT COMPOUNDS LIKE ALCOHOL AND NICATINE OR KAFFINE AND NICATINE OR CERTAIN BEHAVIORS AND CERTAIN DRUGS CAN SINERGIZE TO GIVE BIGGER DOPAMINE INCREASES AND THIS IS NOT TERRIBLY UNCOMMON THERE'RE LOT OF PEOPLE NOWADAYS WHO FOR INSTANCE TAKE PRE WORK OUT ENERGY DRINKS THEY'L DRINK A I WON'T NAME NAMES BUT THEY'LL DRINK A A CANND ENERGY DRANK OR THEUG DRINK A PRE WORK OUT AND THEY'LL TRY AND GET THAT BIG STIMULATION THAT A STIMULAN EFFECT FOR THE DOPAMING THE NORPANEFFRAN THAT FAMILY MOLECULES THAT WORKS TOGETHER TO MAKE YOU MOTIVATED AND THEN THEY'LL ALSO EXERCISE TO TRY AND GET EVEN MORE OF A DOPAMANERGIC EXPERIENCE OUT OF THAT WORK OUT SOMETIMES IT'S ALSO TO PERFORM BETTER AS WELL OF COURSE BUT AS WE'LL TALK ABOUT IN A FEW MINUTES THAT ASPECT OR THAT A PROACH RATHER OF TRYING TO JUST GET YOUR DOPAMING AS HIGH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN IN ORDER TO GET THE MOST OUT OF EXPERIENCE TURNS OUT TO NOT BE THE BEST APPROACH AND WHAT YOU'LL FIND AS WE TALK ABOUT DOPAMINE SCEDULES IS THAT LAYERING TOGETHER MULTIPLE THINGS SUBSTANCES AND ACTIVITIES THAT LEAD TO BIG INCREASES IN DOPAMINE ACTUALLY CAN CREATE PRETTY SEVERE ISSUES WITH MOTIVATION AND ENERGY RIGHT AFTER THOSE EXPERIENCES AND EVEN A COUPLE DAYS LATER SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT PEOPLE SHOULDN'T TAKE THE OCCASIONAL PREWORK OUT IF THAT'S YOUR THING OR DRINK A CUP OF COFFEE OR TWO BEFORE WORKING OUT NOW AND AGAIN SOME PEOPLE REALLY ENDJOY THAT I CERTAINLY DO THAT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE BUT IF YOU DO IT TOO OFTEN WHAT YOU'LL FIND IS THAT YOUR CAPACITY TO RELEASE DOPAMINE AND YOUR LEVEL OF MOTIVATION AND DRIVE IN ENERGY OVER ALL WILL TAKE A SERIOUS HIT NOW I'VE BEEN ALLUDING TO THIS DOPAMIN PEAKS VERSES DOPAMIN BASELINE THINGS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE TALKED ABOUT TONIC AND PHASIC RELEASE AND SO FORTH BUT NOW LET'S REALLY DRILL INTO WHAT THIS MEANS AND HAW TA LEVERAGE IT FOR OUR OWN PURPOSES IN ORDER TO DO THAT LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK AND ASK WHY WOULD WE HAVE A DOPAMINE SYSTEM LIKE THIS WHY WOULD WE HAVE A DOAMIN SYSTEM AT ALL BUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT OUR SPECIES PRIMARY INTEREST IS OUR SPECIES LIKE ALL SPECIES HAS A MAIN INTEREST AND THAT'S TO MAKE MORE OF ITSELF ANS NOT JUST ABOUT SECT AND REPRODUCTION IT'S ABOUT FORGING FOR RESOURCES RESOURCES CAN BE FOOD IT CAN BE WATER CAN BE SALT CAN BE SHELTER CAN BE SOCIAL CONNECTION DOPAMINE IS THE YUNIVERSAL CURRENCY OF FORGING AND SEEKING WE CALL SOMETIMES TALK ABOUT MOTIVATION AND CRAVING BUT WHAT WE MEAN IN THE EVOLUTIONARY ADAPTIVE CONTECT WHAT WE MEAN AS FORGING AND SEEKING SEEKING WATER SEEKING FOOD SEEKING MATES SEEKING THINGS THAT MAKE US FEEL GOOD AND AVOIDING THINGS THE DON'T MAKE US FEEL GOOD BUT IN PARTICULAR SEEKING THINGS THAT WILL PROVIDE SUSTENANCE AND PLEASURE IN THE SHORT TERM AND WILL EXTEND THE SPECIES IN THE LONG TERM ONCE WE UNDERSTAND THAT DOPAMINE IS A DRIVER FOR US TO SEE THINGS IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE AS TO WI IT WOULD HAVE A BASE LINE LEVEL AND IT WOULD HAVE PEAKS AND THAT THE BASE LINE IN PEAKS WOULD BE RELATED IN SOME SORT OF DIRECT WAY HERE'S WHAT I MEAN BY THAT LET'S SAY THAT YOU WERE NOT ALIVE NOW BUT YOU WERE ALIVE TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO AND YOU WOKE UP AND YOU LOOKED AND YOU REALIZE YOU HAD MINIMAL WATER AND YOU HAD MINIMAL FOOD LEFT MAYBE HAVE A CHILD MAY WE HAVE A PARTNER MAB YOU'RE IN AN ENTIRE VILLAGE BUT YOU REALIZE THAT YOU NEED YOU NEED THINGS OKE YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO GENERATE THE ENERGY TO GO SEEK THOSE THINGS AND CHANCES ARE THERE WERE DANGERS IN SEEKING THOSE THINGS YES IT COULD BE SABOR TWO TIGERS AND THING OF THAT SORT BUT THERE ARE OTHER DANGERS TOO THERE'S THE DANGER OF A CUT TO YOUR SKIN THAT COULD LEAD TO INFECTION THERE'S THE DANGER OF STORMS THERE'S THE DANGER OF COLD THERE'S THE DANGER OF LEAVING YOUR LOVED ONES BEHIND SO YOU GO OUT IN FORAGE YOU COULD BE HUNTING YOU COULD BE GATHERING OR YOU COULD BE DOING BOTH THE GOING OUT AND FORAGING PROCES WAS WE ARE CERTAIN DRIVEN BY DOPAMINE MAND THERE'S NO FOSSIL RECORD OF THE BRAIN BUT THESE CIRCUITS HAVE EXISTED WE KNOW FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS AND THEY ARE PRESENT IN EVERY ANIMAL NOT JUST MAMALS BUT EVEN IN LITTLE WORMS LIKE SEELIANS THE SAME PROCESS  MEDIATED BY DOPAMI SO DOPAMIN DRIVES YOU TO GO OUT AND LOOK FOR TH INGS AND THEN LET SAY YOU FIND A COUPLE BERRIES ON THESE ONES ARE ROTTEND THESE ONES ARE GOOD MAYBE YOU HUNT AN ANIMAL AND KILL IT OR YOU FIND AN ANIMAL THAT WAS RECENTLY KILLED AND YOU DECIDE TO TAKE THE MEAT YOU ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE OR I SHOULD SAY EXPERIENCE SOME SORT OF DOPAM IN RELEASE YOU FOUND THE REWARD THAT'S GREAT BUT THEN IT NEEDS TO RETURN TO SOME LOWER LEVEL WHY WHAT BECAUSE IF YOU JUST STAYED THERE YOU WOULD NEVER CONTINUED A FORAGE FOR MORE IT DOESN'T JUST INCREASE YOUR BASE LINE AND THEN STAY THERE IT GOES BACK DOWN AND WHAT'S VERY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND IS THAT IT DOESN'T JUST GO BACK DOWN TO THE LEVEL IT WAS BEFORE IT GOES DOWN TO A LEVEL BELOW WHAT IT WAS BEFORE YOU WENT OUT SEEKING THAT THING NOW THIS IS COUNT AR INTUITIVE WE OFTEN THINK O CAY I'M GOINGTO PURSUE THE WIND IT LET'S LET'S MOVE THIS TO MODERN DAY I'M GOING TO I'M AN A RUN THIS MARATHONUM ON A TRAIN FOR THIS MARATHON THAN YOU RUN THE MARATHON AND YOU FINISH YOU CROSS THE FINISH LINE YOU FEEL GREAT AND YOU WOULD THINK OCANE NOW I'M SET FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR I'MAN IF YOEL SO MUCH BETTER OM AN FEEL THIS ACCOMPLISHMENT IN MY BODIENCE CAN BE SO GREAT THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENS YOU MIGHT FEEL SOME OF THOSE THINGS BUT YOURE LEVEL OF DOPAMINE HAS ACTUALLY DROPPED BELOW BASELINE NOW EVENTUALLY IT WILL RATCH IT BACK UP BUT TWO THINGS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FIRST OF ALL THA EXTENT TO WHICH IT DROPS BELOW BASELINE IS PROPORTIONAL TO HOW HIGH THE PEAK WAS SO IF YOU CROSS THE FINISHED LINE PRETTY HAPPY IT WON'T DROP THAT MUCH BELOW BASELINE AFTERWARD IF YOU CROSS THE FINISH LINE ECSTATIC WELL A DAY OR TWO LATER YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL QUITE A BIT LOWER THAN YOU WOULD OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT NOT BE DEPRESSED BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON WHERE THAT BASELINE WAS TO BEGIN WITH BUT THE SO CALL POSTPARTOM DEPRESSION THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE AFTER GIVING BIRTH OR AFTER SOME BIG WIND A GRADUATION OR ANY KIND OF CELEBRATION THAT POSTPARDOM DROP IN MOOD AND AFFECT AND MOTIVATION IS THE DROP IN BASELINE DOPAME THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THIS HAPPENS ON VERY RAPID TIME SKALES AND IT CAN LAST QUITE A LONG TIME IT ALSO EXPLAINS THE BEHAVIOUR THAT MOST OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH OF ENGAGING IN SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY ENJOY GOING TO A RESTAURANT THAT WE ABSOLUTELY LOVE OR ENGAGING IN SOME WAY WITH SOME PERSON THAT WE REALLY REALLY ENJOY BUT IF WE CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN THAT BEHAVIOUR OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT KIND OF LOSES ITS EDGE IT STARTS TO KIND OF FEEL LESS EXCITING TO US SOME OF US EXPERIENCE THAT DROP AN EXCITEMENT MORE QUICKLY AND MORE SEVERELY THAN OTHERS BUT EVERY ONE EXPERIENCES THAT TO SOME EXTENT AND THIS HAS DIRECT ROUTS IN THESE EVOLUTIONARILY CONCERVE CIRCUITS SOME OF YOU MAY BE HEARING THIS AND THINK NOW NO NO THAT'S NOT OUT WORKS FOR ME I'M JUST RIDING HIGHER AND HIGHER ALL THE TIME I LOVE MY KIDS I LOVE MY JOB I LOVE SCHOOL I LOVE WINDS I I DON'T WANT LOSSES I AGREE WE ALL FEEL GOOD WHEN WE ARE ACHIEVING THINGS BUT OFTENTIMES WE ARE FEELING GOOD BECAUSE WE ARE LAYERING IN DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF LIFE CONSUMING THINGS AND DOING THINGS THAT INCREASE ARE DOPAMINE WERE GETTING THOSE PEAKS BUT AFTERWARD THE DROP IN BASELINE OCCURS AND IT ALWAYS TAKES A LITTLE WHILE TO GET BACK TO AR STABLE BASELINE WE REALLY ALL HAVE A SORT OF DOPAMINE SET POINT AND IF WE CONTINUE TO INDULGE IN THE SAME BEHAVIORS OR EVEN DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS THAT INCREASE OUR DOPAMINE IN THESE BIG PEAKS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN WE WON'T EXPERIENCE THE SAME LEVEL OF JOY FROM THOSE BEHAVIORS OR FROM ANYTHING AT ALL NOW THAT HAS A NAME IT'S CALLED A DICTION BUT EVEN FOR PEOPLE WHO WARN'T ADDICTED EVEN FOR BEOPLE DON'T HAVE AN ATTACHMENT TO ANY SPECIFIC SUBSTANCE OR BEHAVIOR THIS DROP IN BBELOW BASELINE AFTER ANY PEK AN DOPAMINE IS SUBSTANTIAL AND IT GOVERNS WEATHER NOT WE ARE GOING TO FEEL MOTIVE AID TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE OTHER THINGS FORTUNATELY THERE'S A WAY TO WORK WITH THIS SUCH THAT WE CAN CONSTANTLY STAY MOTIVATED BUT ALSO KEEP THAT BASELINE OF DOPAMINE AND APPROPRIATE HEALTHY LEVEL A PREVIOUS GUEST ON THE HUVERMAN LABPODCAST WAS DOCTOR ANNALEMKI SHE SAID OF THE A DICTION DUL DIAGNOSIS CLINIC AT STAMFORD HAS IS SAMAZING BOOK DOPAMINE NATION FINDING BALANCE IN THE AGE OF INDULGENCE IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK A HIGHLY INCURRED YOU A TO CHECK IT OUT ITS FANTASTIC THE OTHER TERRIFIC BOOK ABOUT DOPAMINE IS THE MOLECULE OF MORE WHICH IS A SIMILAR IN SOME REGARD BUT ISN'T SO MUCH ABOUT A DICTION IT'S MORE ABOUT OTHER TYPES OF BEHAVIORS BOTH BOOKS REALLY FOCUS ON THESE DOPAMIN SCHEDULES AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE PEAKS AND BASELINES OF DOPAMINE IN DOCTOR LEMKIE'S BOOK AND WHEN SHE WAS ON THE HUBERMAN LADPODCAST AND OTHER PODCAS SHE'S TALKED ABOUT THIS PLEASURE PAIN BALANCE THAT WHEN WE SEEK SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY LIKE OR WE INDULGIN IT LIKE EATING A PIECE OF CHOCOLATE IF WE REALLY LIKE CHOCOLATE THERE'S SOME PLEASURE BUT THEN THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF PAIN THAT EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT OF PLEASURE AND IT' SUBTLE AND WE EXPERIENCE IT AS WANTING MORE OF THAT THING O CASE O THERE'S A PLEASURE PAIN BALANCE AND I'M TELLING YOU THAT THE PLEASURE AND THE PAIN ARE GOVERNED BY DOPAMINE TO SOME EXTENT OR HOW COULD THAT BE RIGHT I SAID BEFORE WHEN YOU ENGAGE IN AN ACTIVITY OR WHEN YOU INJEST SOMETHING THAT INCREASES DOPAMING THE DOPINE LEVELS GO UP YOU KNOW TO SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE WITH ALL THE THINGS I LISTED OFF WHERE'S THE PAIN COMING FROM WELL THE PAIN IS COMING FROM THE LACK OF DOPAMINE THAT FOLLOWS AND YOU NOW KNOW WHAT THAT LACK OF DOPAMINE REFLECTS HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT EARLIER WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW DOPAMINE IS RELEASED BETWEEN NURONS AND I MENTION TWO WAYS ONE IS INTO THE SYNAPS WHERE IT CAN ACTIVATE THE POSTONAPTIC NURON AND THE OTHER WAS WHAT I CALL VOLYUMETRIC RELEASE WHERE IT IS DISTRIBUTED MORE BROADLY ITS RELEASE OUT OVER A BUNCH OF NURONS IN BOTH CASES IT'S RELEASED FROM THESE THINGS WE CALL SYNAPTIC VESICLES LITERALLY LITTLE BUBBLES TINY TINY LITTLE BUBBLES THAT CONTAIN DOPAMINE THEY GET VOMITED OUT INTO THE AEREA OR INTO THE SYNAPS WELL THOSE VESICLES GET TO PLEADED FOR THE SYNAPTIC PHYSIOLOGISTS OUT THERE WE CALL THIS THE READILY RELEASABLE POOL OF DOPAMIE WE CAN ONLY DEPLOY DOPAMINE THAT IS READY TO BE DEPLOYED THAT'S PACKAGED IN THOSE LITTLE VESICLES AND READY TO GO ITS LIKE WHEN YOU ORDER A PRODUCT AND THEY SAY OUT OF STOCK UNTIL TWO MONTHS FROM NOW WELL IT'S NOT READY TO BE RELEASED SAME THING WITH DOPAMINE THERE'S A POOL OF DOPAMNE THAT SYNTHESIZED AND YOU CAN ONLY RELEASE THE DOPAMINE THAT'S BEEN SYNTHESIZED IS THE READILY RELEASABLE POOL THE PLEASURE PAIN BALANCE DOESN'T ONLY HINGE ON THE READILY RELEASABLEPOOL OF DOPAMINE BUT A BIG PART OF THE PLEASURE PAIN BALANCE HINGES ON HOW MUCH DOPAMINE IS THERE AND HOW MUCH IS READY AND CAPABLE OF BEING RELEASED INTO THE SYSTEM SO NOW WE'VE GIVEN SOME MEAT TO THIS THING THAT WE CALL THE PLEASURE PAINE BALANCE AND NOW IT SHOULD MAKE PERFECT SENSE WHY IF YOU TAKE SOMETHING OR DO SOMETHING THAT LEADS TO HUGE INCREASES IN DOPAMINE AFTERWARD YOUR BASE LINE SHOULD DROP BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A LON OF DOPAMINE AROUND TO KEEP YOUR BASE LINE GOING FORTUNATELY MOST PEOPLE DO NOT EXPERIENCE OR PURSUE ENORMOUS INCREASES IN DOPAMINE LEADING TO THE SEVERE DROPS IN BASE LINE MANY PEOPLE DO HOWEVER AND THAT'S WHAT WE CALL ADDICTION WHEN SOMEBODY PURSUES A DRUG OR AN ACTIVITY THAT LEADS TO HUGE INCREASES IN DOPAMINE AND NOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT AFTERWARD THE BASE LINE OF DOPAMINE DROPS BECAUSE OF DEPLETION OF DOPAMINE THE READILY RELEASABLE POOL THE DOPAMINE IS LITERALLY NOT AROUND TO BE RELEASED IN SO PEOPLE FEEL PRETTY LOUSY AND MANY PEOPLE MAKE THE MISTAKE OF THEN GOING IN PURSUING THE DOPAMINE EVOKING THE DOPAMIN RELEASING ACTIVITY OR SUBSTANCE AGAIN THINKING MISTAKENLY THAT IT'S GOING TO BRING UP THEIR BASE LINE IT'S GOING TO GIVE THEM THAT PEK AGAIN NOT ONLY DOES IT NOT GIVE THEM A PIQUE THEIR BASE LINE GET'S LOWER AND LOWER BECAUSE THEIRE DEPLEATING DOPAMIE MORE AND MORE AND MORE AND WE'VE SEEN THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN PEOPLE GET ADDICTED TO SOMETHING THEN THEYARE NOT ACHIEVING MUCH PLEASURE AT ALL EVEN SEE THIS WITH VIDIO GAMES PEOPLE WILL PLAY OF IDIO GAME THEY LOVE IT IT'S SUPEREXCITING TO THEM AND THEN HEY'LL KEEP PLAYING IN PLAYING IN PLAYING AND EITHER ONE OF TWO THINGS HAPPENS TYPICALLY BOTH FIRST OF ALL I WE SAY A DICTION IS A PROGRESSIVE NARROWING OF THE THINGS THAT BRING YOU PLEASURE SO OFTENTIMES WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THE PERSON ONLY HAS EXCITEMENT AND CAN ACHIEVE DOPAMINE RELEASE TO THE SAME EXTENT DOING THAT BEHAVIOR AND NOT OTHER BEHAVIORS AND SO THEY START LOSING INTEREST IN SCHOOL THEY START LOSING INTEREST IN RELATIONSHIPS THEY START LOSING INTEREST IN FITNESS AND WELL BEING AND DEPLETES THEIR LIFE AND EVENTUALLY WHAT TYPICALLY HAPPENS IS THEY WILL STOP GETTING DOPAMINE RELEASE FROM THAT ACTIVITY AS WELL AND THEN THEY DROP INTO A PRETTY SERIOUS DEPRESSION AND THIS CAN GET VERY SEVERE AND PEOPLE OF COMMIT SUICIDE FROM THESE SORTS OF PATTERNS OF ACTIVITY BUT WHAT ABOUT THE MORE TYPICAL CENARIA WHAT ABOUT THE CENARIO OF SOMEBODY WHO IS REALLY GOOD AT WORKING DURING THE WEEK THEY EXERCISE DURING THE WEEK THEY DRINK ON THE WEEKENDS WELL THAT PERSON IS ONLY CONSUMING ALCALL MAY BE ONE OR TWO NIGHTS A WEK BUT OFTENTIMES THAT SAME PERSON WILL BE SPIKING THEIR DOPAMNE WITH FOOD DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK NOW WE ALL HAVE TO EAT AND IT'S NICE EAT FOODS THAT WE ENJOY I CERTAINLY DO THAT AD LOVE FOOD IN FACT BUT WET'S SAY THEIR EATING FOODS THAT REALLY A VOKE A LOT OF DOPAMINE RELEASE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK THEIR DRINKING ONE OR TWO DAYS ON THE WEEK END THEY ARE ONE OF THESE WORK HARD PLAYHARD TYPE SO THEIRE SWIMMING A COUPLE MILES IN THE OCEAN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK AS WELL A THEY'RE GOING OUT DANCING ONCE ON THE WEEK AN SOMETHING A PRETTY PRETTY BALANCE LIFE AS I DESCRIBE IT WELL HERE'S THE PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IS THAT DOPAMINE IS NOT JUST EVOKED BY ONE OF THESE ACTIVITIES DOPAMINE IS EVOKED BY ALL OF THESE ACTIVITIES AND DOPAMNE IS ONE CURRENCY OF CRAVING MOTIVATION AND DESIRE AND PLEASURE THERE'S ONLY ONE CURRENCY SO EVEN THOUGH IF YOU LOOK AT THE ACTIVITIES YOU'D SAY WELL IT'S JUST ON THE WEEK ENDS OR THIS THING IS ONLY A COUPLE TIMES A WEEK IF YOU LOOKED AT DOPAMINE SIMPLY AS A FUNCTION AS A CHEMICAL FUNCTION OF PEAKS AND BASE LINE IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE WHY THIS PERSON AFTERE SEVERAL YEARS OF WORK HARD PLAYHARD WOULD SAY HAD YOU ON FEELING KIND OF BURNT OUT IMJUST NOT FEELING LIKE I HAVE THE SAME ENERGY THA DID A FEW YEARS AGO AND OF COURSE THEIR AGE RELATED REASONS WHY PEOPLE CAN EXPERIENCE DROPS IN ENERGY BUT OFTENTIMES WHAT'S HAPPENING IS NOT SOME SORT OF DEPLETION AND CELLAR METABOLISM THAT'S RELATED TO AGING WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THERE SPIKING THEIR DOPAMINE THROUGH SO MANY DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE WEEK THAT THEIR BASE LINE IS PROGRESSIVELY DROPPING AND IN THIS CASE IT CAN BE VERY SUBTLE IT CAN BE VERY VERY SUBTLE AND THAT'S ACTUALLY A VERY SINISTER FUNCTION OF DOPAMINE WE WE COULD SAY WHICH IS THAT IT CAN OFTEN DROP IN IMPERCEPTIBLE WAYS BUT THEN AT ONCE IT REACHES A THRESHOLD OF LO DOPAMINE WE JUST FEEL LIKE WE CAN'T REALLY GET PLEASURE FROM ANYTHING ANY MORE WHAT USE TO WORK DOESN'T WORK ANY MORE SO IT STARTS TO LOOK A LOT LIKE THE MORE SEVERE EDICTIONS OR THE MORE ACUTE EDICTIONS TO THINGS LIKE COCANAN ANDPHETEMINE WHICH LEAD TO THESE BIG INCREASES THESE BIG SPIKES IN DOPAMINE AND THEN THESE VERY SEVERE DROPS IN THE BASE LINE NOW OF COURSE WE ALL SHOULD ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES THAT WE ENJOY I CERTAINLY DO EVERYBODY SHOULD A HUGE PART OF LIFE IS PURSUING ACTIVITIES AND AND THINGS THAT WE ENJOY THE KEYTHING IS TO UNDERSTAND THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PEAKS IN THE BASELINE AND TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY INFLUENCE ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE ONCE YOU DO THAT YOU CAN START TO MAKE REALLY GOOD CHOICE IS IN THE SHORT RUN AND IN THE LONG RUN TO MAINTAIN YOUR LEVEL OF DOPOMIN BASE LINE MAYBE EVEN RAISE THAT LEVEL OF DOPOMING BASE LINE AND STILL GET THOSE PEAKS AND STILL ACHIEVE THOSE FEELINGS OF ELEVATED MOTIVATION ELEVATED DESIRE AND CRAVING BECAUSE AGAIN THOSE PEAKS AND HAVING US A SUFFICIENTLY HEALTHY HIGH LEVEL OF DOPOMING BASELINE ARE WHAT DROVE THE EVOLUTION OF OUR SPECIES AND THERE REALLY WHAT DRIVE THE EVOLUTION OF ANY ONE'S LIFE PROGRESSION TO SO THERE AR GOOD THING DOPOMIN IS A GOOD THING JUST VERY BRIEFLY BECAUSE IT WAS ALSO COVERED IN THE INTERVIEW EPISODE I DID WITH ON OLEMPKI ABOUT A DICTION SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE ASKING WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I EXPERIENCE A DROP IN MY BASELINE LEVEL OF DOPOMINE BECAUSE OF ENGAGEMENT WITH SOME ACTIVITY OR SOME SUBSTANCE THAT LED TO BIG PEAKS IJUST TO PUT SOME COLOR AN EXAMPLE ON THIS A FEW EPISODES TO GO I TALKED ABOUT A A FRIEND WHO HAVE KNOWN A LONG TIME SITIALY THE CHILD OF A FRIEND WHO AS BASILY BECOME ADDICTED TO VIDIO GAMES HE DECIDED ACH AFTER SEEING THAT EPISODE WITH ONA TO DO OF THIRTY DAY COMPLETE FAST FROM PHONE FROM VIDIOGAMES AND FROM SOCIAL MEDI OF ALL KINES HE'S NOW A DAY TWENTY NINE HIS REALLY ACCOMPLISH THIS NOT INCIDENTALLY HIS LEVELS OF CONCENTRATION IS OVER ALL MOODOR UP HE'S DOING FAR FAR BETTER WHAT HE DID IS HARD IN PERTYULAR FIRST FOURTEEN DAYS IS REALLY HARD BUT THE WAY THAT YOU REPLENISH THE RELEASABLE POOL OF DOPOMINE IS TO NOT ENGAGE IN THESE DOPOMINURGIC SEEKING BEHAVIORS BECAUSE REMEMBER TYPICALLY PEOPLE ARRIVE AT A PLACE WHERE THEY WANT TO STOP ENGAGING THESE BEHAVIORS ARE INJESTING SUBSTANCES WHEN THAT DOPOMINE IS DEPLEADED WHEN THEYRE NOT GETTING THE SAME LIFT IN HIS CASE HE WAS FEELING DEPRESSED HE THOUGHT HE HAT EIGHTY EIGHTY THEY WERE STARTING TO TREAT AS AS EIGHTY T AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO HAVE EIGHTY GHTY BUT WHAT HE FOUND WAS THAT HIS LEVELS OF CONCENTRATION OR BACK HE DOES NOT NEED TO BE TREATED FORE EIGHTY EIGHTY AND ACTALLY THE PSYCHITRIS WONDERED IF HE DID PRIOR TO THIS VIDIOGAME SOCIAL MEDIA FAST HE'S FEELING GOOD HE IS EXERCISING AGAIN I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP THIS IS REALLY I A VERY SPECIFIC BUT VERY RELEVANT T EXAMPLE OF HOW THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM CAN REPLENISH ITSELF COURSE IF THERE IS A CLINICAL NEED FOR EIGHTY EH T TREATMENT BY ALL MEANS PURSUE THAT BUT I THINK A LOT OF EIGHTY EGH T DOESE GO MISS DIGNOSED BECAUSE OF THIS DEPLETION INDOPOMINE THAT OCCURS BECAUSE OF OVER INDULGENCE AND OTHER ACTIVITIES IN THE DROP IN BASE LINE SO FOR ANY ONE THAT'S EXPERIENCE A REAL DROP IN BASES LINE WHO HAS A DICTIVE TENDENCIES WHETHER NOT THERE BEHAVIORS OR SUBSTANCES THAT IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE PATH FORWARD IS GOING TO BE EITHER COLD TURKEY OR THROUGH SOME SORT OF TAPERING TO LIMIT INTERACTIONS WITH THE WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE THE DOPAMINE EVOKING BEHAVIOR OR SUBSTANCE SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE OPTIMAL WAY TO ENGAGE INACTIVITIES OR TO CONSUME THINGS THAT EVOKE DOPAMINE AND BY NO MEANS OF MY ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO TAKE DRUGS OF ABUSE I WOULD NOT DO THAT I AM NOT DOING THAT BUT SOME OF THE THINGS ON THESE LISTS OF DOPAMINE EVOKING ACTIVITIES ARE THINGS LIKE CHOCOLATE COFFEE EVEN IF IT'S INDIRECT A SEX AND REPRODUCTION PROVIDED ITS HEALTHY CONCENSUAL CONTEXT APPROPRIATE AGE APPROPRIATE SPECIES APPROPRIATE OF COURSE IS CENTRAL TO OUR EVOLUTION AND PRODESSION AS HA SPECIES SO CERTAIN THINGS LIKE COCANE ANPHEDAMINE I WILL PUT IN THE CLASSIFICATION OF BAD UNWILLING TO DO THAT AND OTHER THINGS ARE PART OF LIFE FOOD EXERCISE IF THAT OF OAXS YOUR DOPAME HOW ARE WE SUPOSE TO ENGAGE WITH THESE DOPAMINE EVOKING ACTIVITIES IND WAYS THAT ARE HEALTHY AND BENEFICIAL FOR US HOW DO WE ACHIEVE THESE PEAKS WHICH ARE SO CENSRAL TO RE WELL BEING AN EXPERIENCE OF LIFE WITHOUT DROPPING OUR BASELINE AND THE KEY LIES IN INTERMITTENT RELEASE OF DOPAMINE THE REAL KEY IS TO NOT EXPECT OR CHASE HIGH LEVELS OF DOPAMINE RELEASE EVERY TIME WE ENGAGE IN THESE ACTIVITIES INTERMITTENT REWARD SCHEDULES ARE THE CENTRAL SCHEDULE BY WHICH CASINOS KEEP YOU GAMBOLING THE CENTRAL SCHEDULE BY WHICH ELUSIVE PARTNERS OR POTENTIAL PARTNERS KEEP YOU TEXTING AND PURSUING ON EITHER SIDE OF THE RELATIONSHIP INTERMITENT SCHEDULES ARE THE WAY THAT THE INTERNATE AND SOCIAL MEDIA AND ALL HIGHLY ENGAGING ACTIVITIES KEEP YOU MOTIVATED AND PURSUING AND WE CAN TAKE THIS BACK TO OUR EVOLUTIONARY ADAPTIVE SENARIO WHERE YOU ARE OUT THERE LOOKING FOR WATER LOOKING FOR FOOD NOT EVERY TRAIL NOT EVERY PURSUIT NOT EVERY HUNCH ABOUT WHERE THE ANIMALS WILL BE WERE THE FOOD WILL BE WHERE THE BERRIES WILL BE NOT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE PLAYED OUT THERE SOMETHING CALLED DOPAMINE REWARD PREDICTIONARE WHEN WE EXPECT SOMETHING TO HAPPEN WE ARE HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO PURSUE IT IF IT HAPPENS GREAT WE GET THE REWARD THE REWARD COMES IN VARIOUS CHEMICAL FORMS INCLUDING DOPAMINE AND WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN THAT BEHAVIOR AGAIN THIS IS THE BASIS OF CASINO GAMBLING THIS IS HOW THEY KEEP YOU GOING BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN EVEN THOUGH ON AVERAGE THE HOUSE REALLY DOES WHEN YOU CAN TRANSPLANT THAT EXAMPLE THAT ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PLEASUREFUL ACTIVITIES IF YOU'RE NOT A GAMBLER AND THAT DOES' APPEAL TO YOU I HAVE TO IMAGINE THERE SOMETHING THAT APPEALS TO YOU SOMETHING THAT YOU DO REPEATEDLY BECAUSE YOU ENJOY IT AND ALMOST INEVITABLY IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S AN INTERMITTENT SCHEDUL THERE'S A INTERMITTENT SCHEDULE BY WHICH DOPAMINES SOMETIMES ARRIVES SOMETIMES A LITTLE BIT SOMETIMES A LOT SOMETIMES A MEDIUM AMOUNT  THAT INTERMITTENT REINFORCEMENT SCHEDUL IS ACTUALLY THE BEST SCHEDUL TO EXPORT TO OTHER ACTIVITIES HOW DO YOU DO THAT WELL FIRST OF ALL IF YOU ARE ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES SCHOOL SPORT RELATIONSHIP ET CETERA WHERE YOU EXPERIENCE A WIND YOU SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT ALLOWING YOUR SELF TO EXPERIENCE HUGE PEAKS IN DOPAMINE UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO SUFFER THE THE CRASH THAT FOLLOWS AND WAITING A PERIOD OF TIME FOR IT TO COME BACK UP WHAT WOULD THIS LOOK LIKE IN THE PRACTICAL SENSE WELL LET SAY YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO REALLY DOES ENJOY EXERCISE OR LET'S SAY YOU'R SOMEBODY WHO KINALIKES EXERCISE BUT FORCES YOURSELF TO DO IT BUT YOU MAKE ET PLEASUREFUL BY GIVING YOURSELF YOUR FAVORITE CUP OF COFFEE FIRST OR MAY BE TAKING A PREWORK OUT DRINK OR TAKING AN ENERGY DRINK OR LISTENING O YOUR FAVORITE MUSIC AND THEN YOU'RE IN THE GIM AND YUR LISTENG YOUR MUSIC THAT ALL SOUNDS GREAT RIGHT WELL IT IS GREAT EXCEPT THAT BY LAYRING TOGETHER ALL THESE THINGS TO TRY IN ACHIEVE THAT DOPAMINE RELEASE AND BY GETTING A BIG PEAK AN DOPAMINE YOU'RE ACTUALLY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE PLEASURE FROM THAT ACTIVITY AGAIN AND SO THERE IS A FORM OF THIS WERE SOMETIMES YOU DO ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU LOVE TO GET THE OPTIMA WORK OUT YOU LISTEN YOUR FAVORITE MUSIC YOU AT YOUR FAVORITE TIME OF DAY YOU HAVE YOUR PREWORK OUT DRINK IF THAT'S YOUR THING YOU DO ALL THE THINGS THAT GIVE YOU THAT BEST EXPERIENCE OF THE WORK OUT FOR YOU BUT THERE'S ALSO AVERSION OF THIS WHERE SOMETIMES YOU DON'T DO THE DOPAMINE ENHANCING ACTIVITIES YOU DON'T INGEST ANYTHING TO INCREASE YOUR DOPAMINE YOU JUST DO THE EXERCISE YOU DON'T DO THE EXERCISE AND EXPECT DOPAMINE TO ARRIVE THROUGH SOME WHAT WE CALL EXOGENOUS SOURCE AS WELL MAYTHINK WILLNAT SOUNDS LAME I WANT TO CONTINUE TO ENJOY EXERCISING AH BUT THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT IF YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN MOTIVATION FOR SCHOOL EXERCISE RELATIONSHIPS OR PURSUITS OF ANY DURATION IN KIND THE KEY THING IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PIKAN DOPAMINE IF IT'S VERY HIGH DOESN'T OCCUR TOO OFTEN AND IF SOMETHING DOES OCCUR VERY OFTEN THAT YOU VERY HOW MUCH DOPAMING YOU EXPERIENCE WITH EACH ENGAGEMENT IN THAT ACTIVITY NOW SOME ACTIVITIES NATURALLY HAVE THIS INTERMITTENT PROPERTY WOVEN INTO THEM RI WE SOMETIMES HAVE CLASSES THAT WE LIKE AN OTHER CLASSES WE DON'T LIKE WE DON'T ALWAYS GET STRAIGHT AYS SOMETIMES WE DON'T GET REWARDED WITH THE OUTCOME THAT WE WOULD LIKE WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE PERFECT RELATIONSHIP OUTCOME BUT UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR ABILITY TO EXPERIENCE MOTIVATION AND PLEASURE FOR WHAT COMES NEXT IS DICTATED BY HOW MUCH MOTIVATION AND PLEASURE AND DOPAMINE YOU EXPERIENCED PRIOR THE REASON I CAN'T GIVE A VERY SPECIFIC PROTOCAL LIKE DELEET DOPAMINE OR LOWER DOPAMINE EVE RY THIRD TIME IS THAT THAT WOULDN'T BE INTERMITTENT THE WHOLE BASIS OF INTERMITTANT REENFORCEMENT IS THAT YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE A SPECIFIC SCHEDULE OF WHEN DOPAMINE IS GOING TO BE HIGH AND WHEN DOPAMINE IS GOING TO BE LOW AN WHEN DOPAMINE IS GOING TO BE MEDIUM THAT'S A PREDICTABLE SCHEDULE NOT A RANDOM INTERMITTENT SCHEDULE SO DO LIKE THE CASINOS DO CERTAINLY WORKS FOR THEM AND FOUR ACTIVITIES THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGING OVER TIME WHATEVER THOSE HAPPEN TO BE START PAYING ATTENTION TO THE AMOUNT OF DOPAMINE AND EXCITEMENT AND PLEASURE THAT YOU ACHIEVE WITH THOSE AND START MODULATING THAT SOMEWHAT AT RANDOM THAT MIGHT BE REMOVING SOME OF THE DOPAMINE RELEASING CHEMICALS THAT YOU MIGHT TAKE PRIOR MAYBEOU REMOVE THEM EVERY TIME BUT THEN EVERY ONE'S KNOWHILE YOU INTRODUCE THEM MAYBE IT INVOLVES SOMETIMES DOING THINGS SOCIALLY THAT YOU ENJOY DOING SOCIALLY SOMETIMES DOING THE SAME THING BUT ALONE THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THIS THEREARE LOT OF DIFFRENT WAYS TO APPROACH THIS BUT NOW KNOWING WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT PEKS AND BASE LINES IN DOPAMINE AND UNDERSTANDING HOW IMPORTANT IT IS NOT JUST TO ACHIEVE PEAKES BUT TO MAINTAIN THAT BASE LINE AT A HEALTHY LEVEL IT SHOULD BE STRAIGHTFORWARD FOR YOU TO IMPLEMENT THESE INTERMITTENT SCHEDULES FOR THOSE ARE YOU THAT ARE BEGGING FOR MORE SPECIFICITY WE CAN GIVE YOU A TOOL ONE WOULD BE YOU CAN FLIP A COIN BEFORE ENGAGING IN ANY OF THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES AND DECIDE WHETHER NOT YOU ARE GOING TO ALLOW OTHER DOPAMIN SUPPORTIVE ELEMENTS TO GO FOR INSTANCE INTO THE GIM WITH YOU ARE YOU GOING TO LISTEN TO MUSIC OR NOT IF YOU ENJOY LUS ANY MUSIC WELL THEN FLIPPICOINE AND IF IT COMES UPHEADS BRING THE MUSIGAIN IF IT COMES UP TAILS DON'T SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE UNDERCUTTING YOUR OWN PROGRESS BUT ACTUALLY YOU ARE SERVING YOUR OWN PROGRESS BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM BY DOING THAT NOW THE SMARTPHONE IS A VERY INTERESTING TOOL FOR DOPAMINE IN LIGHT OF ALL THIS IT'S EXTREMELY COMMON NOWADAYS TO SEE PEOPLE TEXTING AND DOING SELFIES AND COMMUNICATING IN VARIOUS WAYS LISTENING TO PODCASTS LISTENING TO MUSIC DOING ALL SORTS OF THINGS WHILE THEY ENGAGE IN OTHER ACTIVITIES ORE GOING TO DINNER AN TEXTING OTHER PEOPLE OR MAKING PLAN SHARING INFORMATION THAT'S ALL WONDERFUL IT GIVES DEPTH AN RICHNESS AND COLOR TO LIFE BUT IT ISN'T JUST ABOUT OUR DESTRACTED NATURE WHEN WEARE ENGAGING WITH THE PHONE IT'S ALSO A WAY OF LAYERING IN DOPAMINE AND IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT LEVELS OF DEPRESSION AND LACK OF MOTIVATION OR REALLY ON THE INCREASE EVERYTHING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT UNTIL NOW SETS UP AN EXPLANATION OR INTERPRETATION OF WHY INTERACTING WITH DIDUAL TECHNOLOGY CONPOTENTIALLLY LEAD TO DESTRUPTIONS ARE LOWERING IN BASE LINE LEVELS OF DOPAMINE I CAN USE A PERSONAL EXAMPLE FOR THIS I HAPPEN TO REALLY ENJOY WORKING OUT I'VE ALWAYS REALLY ENJOYED IT BUT IN RECENT YEARS I NOTICE THAT IF I WAS BRINGING MY PHONE TO MY WORK OUTS THEN NOT ONLY WAS I LITTLE BIT MORE DISTRACTED AND NOT FOCUSSING WHAT I WAS DOING AS MUCH AS I COULD OF OR SHOULD OF BUT ALSO I START TO LOSE INTEREST IN WHAT I WAS DOING IT WASN'T AS PLEASUREFUL I WOULD FEEL LIKE IT JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME KIND OF UMPHAND I WAS BEGINING TO QUESTION MY MOTIVATION AS I START LEARNING MORE ABOUT THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PEAKS IN THE BASE LINES AND DOPAMENE WHAT I REALIZE WAS THAT SOME TIME AGO I PROBABLY EXPERIENCE A INCREDIBLE INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF DOPAMENE DURING ONE OF MY WORK OUTS BECAUSE I ENJOY WORKING OUT AND I ENJOY LISTING A MUSIC I ALSO ENJOY LISTEING A PODCASTS I ALSO ENJOY COMMUNICATING WITH PEOPLE THOSE ARE ALL WONDERFUL PURSUITS BUT I HAD LAYERED IN TOO MANY OF THEM TOO MANY TIMES AND THEN IT ESSENTIALLY WASN'T WORKING FOR ME ANY MORE MUCH IN THE SAME WAY A DRUG WOULDN'T WORK FOR SOMEBODY WHO TAKES IT REPEATEDLY BECAUSE THEIR BASE LINE OF DOPAMENE IS DROPPING SO AT LEAST FOR THIS CALENDER YEAR I'VE MADE A RULE FOR MYSELF WHICH IS I DON'T ALLOW MY PHONE INTO MY WORK OUT AT ALL NO MUSIC AT LEAST NOT FROM THE PHONE IT CAN BE IN THE ROOM I MIGHT LISTEN TO A PODCAST IN THE ROOM BUT I DON'T LISTEN TO ANYTHING OR ENGAGING ANYTHING ON MY PHONE NO TEXTING WHATSOEVER AND MOST THE TIME I JUST DON'T EVEN BRING IT WITH ME FOR THAT PERIOD OF TIME IT'S ONLY A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME I'M NOT TRAINING THAT OFTEN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK HAS BEEN MISINTERPRETED AS PEOPLE CAN'T BE ALONE NOW PEOPLE TALK ABOUT OH YOU KNOW THEY CAN'T WALK ACROSS THE STREE OR THEY CAN'T GO ANYWHERE RIDE THE BUSS CAN'T BE ON THE PLAIN WITHOUT BEING IN CONTACT THEY CAN'T HANDLE JUST THEIR THOUGHTS I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S GOING ON I THINKS WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT WE ACHIEVED THE GREAT DOPOMINE INCREASE THAT COMES FROM THIS INCREDIBLE THING WHICH I PERSONALLY ENJOY BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE BY PHONE BY TAXT AND EXCHANGE PICTURES AND SEND LINX IN THESE KINDS OF THINGS SO CIA MEDIA BUT THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT SAME FULFILLING ASPECT TO IT AND IT TENDS TO REMOVE THE EXCITEMENT IN THE PLEASURE OF THE VERY ACTIVITIES THAT WE ARE ENGAGED IN SO I KNOW THIS IS A HARD ONE FRORM ANY PEOPLE BUT I DO INVITE YOU TO TRY REMOVING MULTIBLE SOURCES OF DOPAMINE RELEASE OR WHAT USED TO BE MULTIBLE SOURCES OF DOPAMEN RELEASE FROM ACTIVITIES THAT YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO ENJOY OR THAT YOU WANT TO ENJOY MORE AND NOW YOU UNDERSTAND THE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT WOULD UNDERLIE A STATEMENT LIKE THAT IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF WORKING WITH I KNOW IT CAN BE CHALLEGING IN THE FIRST WEEK OR SO OF NOT ENGAGING WITH THE PHONE DURING ANY KIND OF WORK OUT THAT ACTUALLY WAS REALLY TOUF BUT NOW I'M BACK TO A PLACE WHERE I ENJOY THAT MUCH MORE I ALSO FEEL AS IF I CONQUERED SOMETHING IN TERMS OF THE CIRCUITRY RELATED TO DOPAMEN I NOW UNDERSTAND WHY SOMETHING THAT I ENJOYED SO MUCH HAD BECOME LESS PLEASUREFUL FOR ME AND THERE'S A DEEP DEEP SATISFACTION THAT COMES FROM UNDERSTANDING OKEY THERE WASN'T ANYTHING WRONG WITH ME R T E WHAT I WAS DOING OR ANYTHING AT ALL IT WAS JUST A THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE APPROACH I WAS TAKING WHICH WAS LAYERING IN ALL THESE SOURCES OF DOPAMINE AND DROPPING MY BASELINE FOR THIS VERY SAME REASON I CAUTION PEOPLE AGAINST USING STIMULANTS EVERY TIME THEY STUDY OR EVERY TIME THEY WORK OUT OR EVERY TIME THAT THEY DO ANYTHING THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO ENDJOY AND BE MOTIVATED AT THERE'S ONE EXCEPTION WHICH IS CAFFINE BECAUSE I MENTION BEFORE IF YOU LIKE CAFFINE THAT ACTUAL COULD BE A GOOD THING FOR YOUR DOPAMINE SYSTEM BECAUSE IT DOES UPREGULATE THESE D TWO D THREE RECEPTORS SO IT ACTUALLY MAKES WHATEVER DOPOMINE IS RELEASED BY THAT ACTIVITY MORE ACCESSIBLE OR MORE FUNCTIONAL WITHIN THE BIL CHEMISTRY IN THE PATHWAYS OF YOUR BRAIN AND BODY HOWEVER A NUMBER OF ENERGY DRINKS AN IN PARTICULAR PREWORK OUTS CONTAIN THINGS THAT ARE PRECURSORS TO DOPOMNE AND ON THEIR OWN EVEN IF YOU DINT ENGAGE IN THE ACTIVITY WOULD CAUSE THE RELEASE OF DOPAMINE TO A SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE THEY DO CAUSE THE RELEASE OF DOPAMING TO A SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE AND OVER TIME THAT WILL DEPLETE YOUR DOPOMINE SO ENERGY DRINKS PREWORK OUT DRINKS DRUGS OF VERIOUS KINDS THAT PEOPLE TAKE TO STUDY AND PAY ATTENTION WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THESE FOR THE AIGT AE TE EPISODE THINGS LIKE AT AR ALL RIDDLEIN ARMODAPHANOMODAPHINIL TAK IN REPEATEDLY OVER TIME WILL REDUCE THE LEVEL OF SATISFACTION ENJOY THAT YOU GET FROM THE ACTIVITIES YOU ENGAGE IN WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THOSE COMPOUNDS I'M NOT TRYING TO DEMINIZE THOSE COMPOUNDS FOR THEIR CLINICAL USE WHEN I'M SAYING IS TAKING STIMULANS AND THEN ENGAGEING IN ACTIVITIES THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO FEEL PLEASUREFUL IS UNDERCUTTING THE PROCESS AND INEVITABLY MIGH NOT HAPPEN TO MORROW MIGHT NOT HAPPEN IN A MONTH BUT INEVITABLY YOU WILL HAVE CHALLENGES WITH MOTIVATION AND DRIVE RELATED TO THOSE ACTIVITIES NOW SOME PEOPLE CAN KEEP IT RIGHT IN CHECK THAT CAN JUST DO THE ONE CAN OF THE ENERGY DRINKER THEY ONLY DO THEIR PREWORK OUT BEFORE REALLY HARD DAYS FOR INSTANCE MORE POWER TO YOU I ACTUALLY DO THAT SOMETIMES FRANKLY BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO GET INTO THAT PIQUE SUPERMODE OF ATEAD DRIVEN DRIVEN STATE REALLY FOCUSED EVERY TIME THEY ENGAGE INT IN ACTIVITY YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY UNDERCUTTING THE PROCESS AND YOU ARE UNDERMINING YOUR ABILITY TO STAY MOTIVATED IN FOCUS SO JUST AS WE TALKED ABOUT INTERMITTINT REWARD SCHEDULS A MOMENT AGO INTERMITTANT SPIKING OF DOPOMINE IF YOU DO IT AT ALL IS DEFINITELY THE WAY TO GO AND CHRONICALLY TRYING TO SPITE YOUR DOPAMINE IN ORDER TO ENHANCE YOUR MOTIVATION FOCUS IN DRIVE WILL ABSOLUTELY UNDER MINE YOUR MOTIVATION FOCUS IN DRIVE IN THE LONG RUN INGESTION OF CAFFINE IS SOMEWHAT OV AN ECEPTION AMONG THE OTHER EXAMPLES OF THINGS I'VE MENTION TO AVOID BEFORE WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE DOPAMNE INCREASING ACTIVITIES BECAUSE AGAIN CAFFI N CAN INCREASE THE DENSITY AND THE EFFICACY OF THESE DOPOMING RECEPTORS TURNS OUT THAT THE SOURCE OF CAFFINE COULD ALSO MATTER WHILE CAFFI OR TE OR OTHER FORMS OF CAFFINE WE'LL HAVE THIS EFFECT OF INCREASING DOPOMING RECEPTORS ERBOMATE SOMETHING I'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE ON THIS PODCASS HAS SOME INTERESTING PROPERTIES FIRST OF ALL IT CONTAINS CAFFINE IT'S ALSO HIGH AND ANTIOXIDENTS IT ALSO CONTAIN SOMETHING CALLED GIOL P ON WHICH IS FAVORABLE FOR MANAGEMENT OF BLUDSHUGER LEVELS ERBOMATE T TURNS OUT HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO BE NEURO PROTECTIVE SPECIFICALLY FOR DOPOMIN URGENC NURONS NOW I SHOULD MENTION THIS IS JUST A COUPLE OF STUDIES S WE DON'T WANT TO CONCLUDE TOO MUCH FROM THESE STUDIES MORE NING TO BE DONE BUT THEY SHOWED THAT IN A MODEL OF DAMAGE TO DOPOMING NURONS IDGESTION OF ERBOMATE AND SOME OF THE COMPOUNDS WITHIN ERBOMATE CAN ACTUALLY SERVE TO PRESERVE THE SURVIVAL OF DOPOMING NURONS IN BOTH THE MOVEMENT RELATED PATHWAY AND THE MOTIVATION PATHWAY SO PERHAPS YOU NEED THAT INCENTIVE IN ORDER TO INJEST ERBOMATETI PERHAPS I DON'T NEED ANY INCENTIVE IN MY CASE I DON'T NEED ANY INCENTIVE I ALREADY ENJOY YERBOMATE IS MY PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF CAFFINE ALTHOUGH I DO DRINK COFFY IS WELL BUT IF ONE WERE GOING TO CONSUME CAFFINE YOU MIGHT CONSIDER CONSUMING THAT CAFFINE IN THE FORM OF ERBOMATE BOTH FORSAKE OF UPREGULATING DOPEMING RECEPTORS AND GETTING MORE OF A DOPOMING INCREASE AND OF COURSE FOR THE STIMULA PROPERTIES OF CAFFINE IF THAT'S WHAT YOURE SEEKING AND IN ADDITION TO THAT BECAUSE ERBOMATE DOES APPEAR TO HAVE SOME SORT OF NERO PROTECTIVE AND IN PARTICULAR DOPOMING NURON PROTECTIVE PROPERTIES NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE CAFFIN IS ALWAYS BENEFICIAL AND ACTUALLY THERE IS ONE INSTANCE RELATED TO DOPOMINE WHERE CAFFINE CAN BE PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS THIS RELATES TO EM DIAMA SO CALLED ECSTASY EMDIAMAS UNDER INVESTIGATION IN VARIOUS CLINICAL TRIALS FOR ITS POTENTIAL TO TREAT TRAMA AND DEPRESSION IT'S ALSO OF COURSE A DRUG THAT'S USED RECREATIONALLY IT STILL I LEGAL AT LEAST IN THE UNITED STATES WHETHER NOT EM DIAMAS NERO TOXIC HAS BEEN VERY CONTROVERSIAL EARLY ON IT WAS THOUGHT THAT IT IS NEROTOXIC THAT IT CAN DESTROY SERGE AN URGIC NURONS THERE WERE OTHER PAPERS THAT CAME OUT WHICH ARGUED THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND THATIN PARTICULAR BECAUSE ONE OF THE EARLY PAPERS PUBLISHED IN SCIENCE MAGAZINE CLAIMING THAT EMIME WAS NEROTOXIC THAT PAPER WAS RETRACTED IT TURNS OUT THAT THAT STUDY HAD MISTAKENLY USED METHEM PEDEMINE INSTEAD AND METHEM FEDEMINE IS KNOWN TO BE NEROTOXIC I THINK MOST OF THE DATA POINT TO THE IDEA THAT EM DIAMA MIGHT NOT BE NEROTOXIC BUT IN ANY CASE CAFFINE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE THE TOXICITY OF EMDIAMA RECEPTORS AND YOU MIGH A HOW COULD THAT BE WELL NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHY THAT COULD BE KAFFINE INCREASES THE DENSITY AND EFFICACY OF THESE DOPAMING RECEPTORS THE D TU IND THREE RECEPTORS M DIAMA IS A POTENT DRUG FOR INCREASING CONCENTRATIONS OF DOPAOMING AS WELL AS CERETONAN ANOTHER NUROMODULATORS AND IT APPEARS THAT KAFFINE INGESTION BY UPREGULATING THESE RECEPTORS CAN LA TO MORE TOXTICITY OF M DI MA SO KAFFINE CAN BE A BENEFICIAL SUBSTANCE IN ONE CONTACT AND ACTUALLY CAN BE A DETRIMENTAL IF NOT DANGEROU SUBSTANCE IN ANOTHER CONTEXT TWO SUBSTANCES THAT GREATLY INCREASE DOPAMING NAMELY EMPHEDEMING AND COKAIN CAN CAUSE LONG TERM PROBLEMS WITH THE DOPAMANURGECT PATHWAYS AND THIS IS LARGELY BASED ON A STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHED SOME YEARS AGO TWO THOUSAND IND THREE BUT STILL HOLDS A LOT OF MERIT THIS IS A PAPER PUBLISHIN PROCEEDS IN THE NATIONAL ACADEMY AFSCIENCES A VERY HIGH TER STRINGENT JOURNAL FIRST AUTHORIS COLB CAOEL BE AND THE TITLE OF THE PAPER PRETEMUCH TELLS THE STORY EMPHEDEMING OR COKAINE LIMITS THE ABILITY OF LATER EXPERIENCE TO PROMOTE STRUCTURAL PLASTICITY IN THE NEQUARTEX AND NEUCLES ACCOMMENTS NEO QUARTEXES THE OUTER SHELL OF THE BRAIN A MORE OR LESS AND THE NEWLYS THE COMMONS IS PART OF THAT MESOLYMBIC A DOPAMING PATHWAY FOR MOTIVATION DRIVE AND REINFORCEMENT NOR A PLASTICITY OF COURSE IS THE BRAINS ABILITY TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE IN NEURO PLASTICITY IS THE BASIS OF LEARNING AND MEMORY AND ESSENTIALLY REMODELLING OF OUR NERL CIRCUITRY IN POSITIVE WAYS OF ALL KINDS AND THIS STUDY WAS REALLY ONE OF THE FIRST TO SHOW THAT IN JESTING EMPEDEMING AND COKAIN BECAUSE OF THE HIGH PIQUE IN DOPAMING THAT IT CREATES AND THE LOW DOPOMINE STATE THE BASE LINE DROP THAT IT CREATES AFTERWARDS LIMITS PLASTICITY AND LEARNING SUBSEQUENT TO TAKING AMPEDEMING AN COKANE IT WAS AT LEAST IN THIS STUDY SHOWN TO BE A LONG LASTING EFFACT I DOUBT ITS A PERMANENT EFFECT BUT THIS SHOULD SERVE AS A SERIOUS CAUTIONARY NOTE THAT MPHEDMING AND COKAINE NOT ONLY CAN CAUSE A DROP IND BASELINE DOPOMING BUT CAN ACTUALLY PUT THE BRAIN INTO A STATE IN WHICH IT CANNOT LEARN AND MODIFY ITSELF TO GET BETTER AT LEAST FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME IN A PREVIOUS EPISODE ON EIGHTY HT A TALKED ABOUT THE WIDESPREAD USE OF DRUGS LIKE ATERAL RIDDLIN MODAPHENEN ARMODAPHEN ALL OF WHICH LEAD TO VERY LARGE INCREASES IN DOPAOMING AND FOR PEOPLE WITH EIGHTY HTY CAN REALLY IMPROVE THEIR SYMPTOMS BUT OF COURSE THERE IS A LOT OF NON PRESCRIPTION NON CLINICAL USE OF THOSE COMPOUNDS AS WELL AND IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THE USE OF THOSE SUBSTANCES TO INCREASE DOPAOMING COULD VERY WELL PROVIDE THE SAME SORT OF BLOCKADE OF NEROL PLASTICY THAT COCANE AND AMPHEDEMING DO BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF DOPAMING INCREASE THAT TRIGGERED BY THOSE COMPOUNDS ITS REALLY COMPARABLE SO AGAIN A CAUTIONARY NOTE AGAINST SPIKING ONE'S DOPAMINE TOO MUCH ON A REGULAR BASIS UNLESS THERE IS A VALID CLINICAL NEED FOR DOING THAT SO WE'VE BEEN FOCUSSING A LOT FOR THE LAST FEW MINUTES ON THE KIND OF DARKER SIDE OF DOPAMINE AND HOW GETTING BIG PEAKS IN DOPAMINE CAN BE DETRIMENTAL BUT I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRUTH WHICH IS THAT DOPAMINE FEELS GREAT BEING IN PURSUIT AND MOTIVATED AND CRAVING THINGS FEELS WONDERFUL AND I DON'T WANT TO DEMONIZE DOPAMINE WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO TO DAY IS TO ILLUSTRATE HOW DOPAMINE WORKS IN YOUR BRAIN SO THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN DOPAMINE EVOKING ACTIVITIES AND CERTAINLY THERE IS A PLACE FOR INJESTING THINGS THAT CAN INCREASED DOPAMINE PROVIDED THAT THEY ARE SAFE FOR US IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM THERE ARE ACTIVITIES THAT WE CAN DO THAT WILL GIVE US HEALTHY SUSTAINED INCREASES IN DOPAMINE BOTH THE PEAKS WHEN THEY HAPPEN AND TO MAINTAIN OR EVEN INCREASE OUR BASE LINE LEVELS OF DOPAMINE SO HOW DO WE DO THAT WAT ER SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES WELL IN RECENT YEARS THERE'S BEEN A TREND TOWARD MORE PEOPLE DOING SO CALLED COLD EXPOSURE IN PART THIS WAS POPULARIZED BY VIMHOFF THE SO CALLED ICEMEN GETTING INTO COLD SHOWERS TAKING ICE BATHS EXPOSING ONESELF TO COLD WATER OR VARIOUS KINDS CAN IN FACT INCREASE OUR LEVELS OF DOPAMINE AS WELL AS THE NEURMODULATOR NERAR BENEFEREN THIS IS NOT A NEW PHENOMENON IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES A GOD BY THE NAME OF VINCENT PRISONITS WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO POPULAREYES AND FORMALEYES COLD WATER THERAPIES HE WAS AN ADVOCATE OF COLD WATER EXPOSURE IN ORDER TO BUSTHE EMUNE SYSTEM AND INCREASE FEELINGS OF WELL BEING AND ACTUALLY THIS PRACTICE DATES BACK LONG BEFORE AVINCEN'S A POPULARIZED IT AND VIMHOFF IS THE MORE RECENT ITERATION OF THIS FIRST OF ALL SOME OF THE SAFETY PERAMETERS LET'S LET'S ESTABLISH THOSE FIRST GETTING TO VERY VERY COLD WATER IN THIRTY DEGREE FERENIDE OR EVEN LOW FORTY DO RE FAIR NIT CAN PUT SOMEBODY INTO A STATE OF COLD WATER SHOCK AND PEOPLE CAN DIE DOING THAT SO OBVIOUSLY YOU ONT APPROACH THIS A WITH SOME CAUTION BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE GETTING INTO SIXTY DEGREE WATER OR FIFTY DEGREE WATER OR IF YOUR ACCLAMATED AND COMFORTABLE WITH IT A  FORTY DEGREE WATER OR FORTY FIVE DRUGRY WATER CAN HAVE TREMENDOUSLY BENEFICIAL RESULT ON YOUR NERMODULATOR SYSTEMS INCLUDING DOPAMINE WHAT TEMPERATURE OF WATER YOU CAN TOLERATE WILL DEPEND ON HOW COLD WATER ADAPTED YOU ARE AND HOW FAMILIAR YOU ARE WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF GETTING INTO COLD WATER AND WHEN I SAY COMFORTABLE WITH I SHOULD MENTION THERE IS NEVER A CASE IN WHICH GETTING IN TO COLD WATER DOES NOT EVOKE A RELEASE OF EPINEFRON SO THE QUICKENING OF THE BREATH THE WIDENING OF THE EYES THE THE THE FEELING AS IF YOU CAN'T CATCH YOUR BREATH AND EVEN SOME PHYSICAL PAIN AT THE LEVEL E THE SKIN THAT HAPPENS ALMOST EVERY TIME WERE EVERY TIME THAT YOU GET INTO COLD WATER EVEN IF YOUR COLD WATER ADAPTED WHAT ALMOST EVERYBODY KNOWS AND UNDERSTANDS IS THAT THAT WALL AS I LIKE TO REFER TO IT IS COMING THAT'S ALWAYS THE FIRST EXPERIENCE OF GETTING INTO COLD WATER THERE'S NO REAL WAY AROUND THAT NOW THE STUDY THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER HUMAN PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO IMMERGIN INTO WATER OF DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES REALLY INTERESTING STUDY IT WAS DONE AND PUBLISH IN THE UNIVERSITY EXCUSE ME THAT EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY I CAN PRIDE A LINK TO THAT STUDY IN THE IN THE SHOCAPTION SO REALLY INTERESTING STUDY THEY LOOKED AT PEOPLE GETTING EXPOSED TO WATER THAT WAS WARM MODERATELY COLD OR VERY COLD AT WAS THIRTY TWO DEGREES SELSIAS TWENTY DEGREES SELSIES OR FOURTEEN DEGREES SELSIUS YOU CAN JUST PUT THOSE ON LINE AND DO THE CONVERSION OR YOU CAN DO THE CONVERSION TO FERENHITE IF YOU LIKE BUT IN ANY CASE WHAT THEY LOOKED AT WERE THE CONCENTRATIONS OF THINGS LIKE EPINEFERON AND DOPOMINE AND SO ON AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS REALLY INTERESTING FIRST OF ALL UPON GETTING INTO COLD WATER THE CHANGES IN A DRENALIN AND NORA DRENALIN EPINEFRON AND NORPANEFRON WERE IMMEDIATE AND FAST AND THESE WERE HUGE INCREASES SO THAT'S THE GETTING INTO THE COLD WATER THAT EVERYBODY EXPERIENCES THESE HUGE INCREASES IN A DRENALINE BUT THEN WHAT WAS INTERESTING AS THEY OBSERVED THAT DOPOMINE LEVELS STARTED TO RISE SOMEWHAT SLOWLY AND THEN CONTINUED TO RISE AND REACHED LEVELS AS HIGH AS TO POINT FIVE TIMES ABOVE BASE LINE THAT'S A REMARKABLY HIGH INCREASE REMEMBER IF WE GO BACK TO ARE EXAMPLES OF CHOCOLATE CEPTS A DOUBLING ABOVE BASE LINE NICOTINE TOANALFTIMES ABOVE BASELINE COCINE THE INCREASE IN DOPOMINE FROM COLD WATER EXPOSURE OF THIS KIND WAS COMPARABLE TO WHAT ONE SEES FROM COCANE EXCEPT EXCEPT IN THIS CASE IT WASN'T ARISE AND CRASH IT WAS ACTUALLY A SUSTAINED RISE IN DOPOMINE THAT TOOK A VERY LONG TIME UP TO THREE HOURS TO COME BACK DOWN TO BASE LINE WHICH IS REALLY REMARKABLE AND I THINK THIS EXPLAIN SOME OF THE POSITIVE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL EFFECTS THAT PEOPLE REPORT SUBJECTIVELY AFTER DOING COLD WATER EXPOSURE ONE QUESTION THAT MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY ASKING IS JUST HOW COLD SHOULD THE WATER BE WHELE YOU COULD MIMIC WHAT WAS DONE IN THIS STUDY IN DO FOURTEEN DEGREES SELSIUS BUT FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT WON'T BE COLD ENOUGH FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT WILL BE TOO COLD THEY DID LOO AT THE RELEASE OF STRESSHORMONES LIKE CORTISAL IN ADDITION TO THE RELEASE OF THINGS LIKE EPINEFERONAN AN DRENALIN AND IT'S INTERESTING THAT THEY NOTED THAT IN ALL CASES BUT ESPECIALLY AT THAT COLD AST TEMPERATURE THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN CORTIS ALL BUT THAT IT WAS TRANSIENT THAT EVENTUALLY PEOPLE'S CORTIS ALL THIS STRESS HORMONE SUBSIDED A BIT THERE ARE BASICALLY TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO REMAINING IN THE COLD WHEN IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE ONE IS TO TRY IND RELAX YOURSELF TO TRY IN PRACTISE SLOW BREATHING TO TRY AND DILATE YOUR GAZE I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE IN PREVIOUS PODCASTS GOING TO PANORAMIC VISION TO A SINCEULY TRYING CALM YOURSELF SO THAT IT'S NOT AS STRESSFUL IN THE COLD OTHER PEOPLE HOWEVER TAKE THE APPROACH OF TRYING TO RAMP UP THEIR LEVEL OF INTERNAL AUTONOMIC ARAUSAL MEANING TO GET REALLY ENERGIZED AND GET LEAN INTO THE FRICTION OF THE COLD AND THEY FIND THAT EASIER OTHER PEOPLE DISTRACT THEMSELVES THEY RECITE THE ALPHABET OR THEY DO SOMETHING ANYTHING TO TRY AND DISTRACT THEMSELVES FROM THE DISCOMFORT TO BE TOTALLY HONEST IT DOES NOT MATTER FOR SAKE OF DOPAMIE RELEASE BECAUSE THE DOPAMIN RELEASE IS TRIGGERED AND THEN CONTINUES EVEN AFTER YOU GET OUT OF THE COLD WATER NOW IN THIS STUDY IT WAS LONG EXPOSURE TO COLD WATER T WAS AN HOUR THAT'S A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND I DO WARN YOU AGAINST GETTING INTO COLD WATER THAT'S SO COLD THAT IT WILL MAKE YOUR TEMPERATURE DROP AND MAKE YOU HYPROTHERMIC FOR AN HOUR THAT ACTUALLY COL BE DANGEROUS FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WE MIGHT HAVE A HARD TIME RE HEATING IN HYPOTHERMIAS NOT A GOOD THING THEY HAD PEOPLE MONETERING SUBJECTS IN THESE STUDIES AND PAYING ATTENTION TO THEIR CORBODY TEMPERATURE THEY WERE ABLE TO REHEAT THEM AFTERWARDS IT'S WELL ESTABLISHED NOW THAT GETTING INTO COLD WATER WHETHER NOTS A SHOWER AND ICE BATH CIRCULATING COLD WATER A STREAM ET CETERA THAT CAN EVOKE THE NORUP AN EFFERENT RELEASE IMMEDIATELY AND THE LONG ARC OF THAT DOPAMINE RELEASE WHY WOULD THAT BE GOOD UP UNTIL NOW I'VE BASELY SAID GETTING INCREASES IN DOPAMINE ARE DETRIMENTAL TO YOUR BASE LINE WELL THIS DOES APPEAR TO RAISE THE BASELINE OF DOPOMINE FOR SUBSTANTIAL PERIODS OF TIME AND MOST PEOPLE REPORT FEELING A HEIGHT EN LEVEL OF CALM AND FOCUS AFTER GETTING OUT OF COLD WATER SO COLD WATER EXPOSURE TURNS OUT TO BE A VERY POTENT STIMULUS FOR SHIFTING THE ENTIRE MILOU THE ENTIRE ENVIRONMENT OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY AND ALLOWING MANY PEOPLE TO FEEL MUCH MUCH BETTER FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PERIOD OF TIME AFTER GETTING OUT OF THE ICE BATH OR COLD WATER OF ANY KIND THAN THEY DID BEFORE NOW YOU MIGHT ASK HOW OFTEN TO DO THIS SOME PEOPLE DO THIS EVERY DAY IT CAN BE VERY STIMULATING SO TYPICALLY DOING IT EARLY IN THE DAY IT'S GOING BE BETTER I DON'T NOSURELY RECOMMEND DOING IT RIGHT BEFORE SLEEP BUT SOME PEOPLE DO IT IN THE AFTERNOON AND SOME PEOPLE WILL INDEED DO THAT SEVEN DAYS A WEEK OTHER PEOPLE THREE DAYS A WEEK OTHER PEOPLE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE WHAT I CAN SAY IS ONCE YOU BECOME COLD WATER ADAPTED ONCE IT NO LONGER HAS THE SAME IMPACT OF NOVELTY AND FEELING A BIT LIKE A I DON'T LA SAY SHOCKED YOUR SYSTEM BECAUE YOU DON'T WANT TO GOING TO COLD WATER SHOCK BUT ONCE IT IS COMFORTABLE FOR YOU THEN IT WILL NO LONGER EVOKE THIS RELEASE THERE REALLY DOES SEEM TO BE SOMETHING IN THE PATHWAY FROM COLD WATER EXPOSURE THROUGH THE NOR UP AN EFFREN PATHWAY AND INTO THE MESOLYMIC BRAINSTEMP THAT CAUSES THIS RELEASE IN DOPAMINE BUT NONE THE LESS IT'S AY BASICALLY ZERO COST A M YOU NEED ACCESS TO WATER OF SOME SORT COLD WATER R SHOWER ET CETERA BUT BASICALLY ZERO COST WAY OF TRIGGERING A LONG LASTING INCREASE IN DOPAMING WITHOUT INGESTING ANY THAN NO FHARMACOLEGY WHATSOEVER PLEASE AGAIN APPROACH IT WITH A SAFETY IN CAUTION IN MINE BUT IT IS A VERY POTENT STIMULUS AGAIN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PER CENT A A RISE IN BASELINE TWO AND HAVE TINE DRIES IN BASELINE RIVALS THAT OF COCANE WHICH IS REALLY REMARKABLE NOW I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF REWARDS FOR OUR BEHAVIOR AND THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF REWARDS FOR OUR BEHAVIOR AND FROM THAT I WILL SUGGEST A PROTOCAL BY WHICH YOU CAN ACHIEVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP TO YOUR ACTIVITIES AND TO YOUR DOPAMINE SYSTEM IN FACT IT WILL HELP TUN UP YOUR DOPAMINE SYSTEM FOR DISCIPLINE HARD WORK AND MOTIVATION HARD WORK IS HARD GENERALLY MOST PEOPLE DON'T LIKE WORKING HARD SOME PEOPLE DO BUT MOST PEOPLE WORK HARD IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE SOME ENGOAL EN GOALS ARE TERRIFIC AND REWARDS ARE TERRIFIC WHETHER NOT THEY ARE MONITARY SO SHOAL OR ANY KIND HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT DOPAMINE RELATES TO OUR PERCEPTION OF TIME WORKING HARD AT SMETHING FORSAKE OF A REWARD THAT COMES AFTERWARD CAN MAKE THE HARD WORK MUCH MORE CHALLENGING AND MAKE US MUCH LESS LIKELY TO LEAN INTO HARD WORK IN THE FUTURE LET ME GIVE YOU A COUPLE EXAMPLES BY WAY OF DATA AND EXPERIMENTS THERE'S A CLASSIC EXPERIMENT DAWN ACTUALLY AT STAMPFORD MANY YEARS AGO IN WHICH CHILDREN IN NURSERY SCHOOL AND KINDERGARDEN DREW PICTURES AND THEY DREW PICTURES CAUSE THEY LIKE TO DRAW THE RESEARCHERS TOOK KIDS THAT LIKE TO DRAW AND THEY STARTED GIVING THEM A REWARD FOR DRAWING THE REWARD GENERALLY WAS A GOLD STAR OR SOME SEEING THAT A YOUNG CHILD WOULD FIND REWARDING THEN THEY STOP GIVING THEM THE GOLD STAR AND WHAT THEY FOUND IS THE CHILDREN HAD A MUCH LOWER TENDENCY TO DRAW ON THEIR OWN NO REWARD NOW REMEMBER THIS WAS AN ACTIVITY THAT PRIOR TO RECEIVING A REWARD THE CHILDREN INTRINSICALLY ENJOYED AND SELECTED TO DO NO ONE WAS TELLING THEM TO DRA WHAT THIS RELATES TO IS SO CALLED INTRINSIC VIRSES EXTRINSIC REINFORCEMENT WHEN WE RECEIVE REWARDS EVEN IF WE GIVE OURSELVES REWARDS FOR SOMETHING WE TEND TO ASSOCIATE LESS PLEASURE WITH THE ACTUAL ACTIVITY ITSELF THAT EVOKED THE REWARD NOW THAT MIGHT SEEMCOUNTER INTUITIVE BUT THAT'S JUST WAY THE WAY THAT THESE DOPAMAN NURGIC CIRCUITS WORK AND NOW UNDERSTANDING THESE PIQUES IN BASE LINES IN DOPAMINE WHICH I WONT REVIEW AGAIN THIS SHOULD MAKE SENSE IF YOU GET A PIQUE IN DOPAMINE FROM A REWARD IT'S GOING TO LOWER YOUR BASE LINE AND THE COGNITIVE INTERPRETATION IS THAT YOU DIDN'T REALLY DO THE ACTIVITY BECAUSE YOU ENJOY THE ACTIVITY YOU DID IT FOR THE REWARD NOW THIS DOESN MING ALL REWARDS OF ALL KINDS AR BAD BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT DOPAMIN CONTROLS OUR PERCEPTION OF TIME WHEN AND HOW MUCH DOPAMINE WE EXPERIENCE IS THE WAY THAT WE CARVE UP WHAT WE CALL OUR EXPERIENCE OF TIME WHEN WE ENGAGE IN AN ACTIVITY LET SAY SCHOOL OR HARD WORK OF ANY KIND OR EXERCISE BECAUSE OF THE REWARD WE ARE GOING TO GIVE OURSELVES AR RECEIVE AT THE END THE TROPHY THE SUNDAY THE MEAL WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE WE ACTUALLY ARE EXTENDING THE TIME BEEN OVER WHICH WE ARE ANALYZING OR PERCEIVING THAT EXPERIENCE AND BECAUSE THE REWARD COMES AT THE END WE START TO DISSOCIATE THE NORL CIRCUITS FOR DOPAMINE AND REWARD THAT WOULD HAVE NORMALLY BEEN ACTIVE DURING THE ACTIVITY AND BECAUSE IT ALL ARRIVES AT THE END OVER TIME WE HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF LESS AND LESS PLEASURE FROM THAT PARTICULAR ACTIVITY WHILE WE'RE DOING IT NOW THIS IS THE ANTITHESIS OF GROWTH MIND SET MY COLLEAGUE AT STAMPORED CAROLDUEC AS MANY IF YOU KNOW S COME UP WITH THIS INCREDIBLE THEORY AND PRINCIPLE AND ACTUALLY GOES BEYOND THEORY IN PRINCIPLE CALLED GROWTH MIND SET WHICH IS THIS STRIVING TO BE BETTER TO BE IN THIS MIND SET OF I'ME NOT THERE YET BUT STRIVING ITSSELF IS THE ENGOL AND THAT OF COURSE DELIVERS YOU TO TREMENDOUS PERFORMANCES BEEN OBSERVED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIND THAT PEOPLE THAT HAVE GROWTH MIND SET GUTS TA HAVE GROWTH MIND SET AND UT PERFORMING VERY WELL BECAUSE THEIR FOCUSSED ON THE EFFORT ITSELF AND ALL OF US CAN CULTIVATE GROWTH MINE SET THE NORL MECHANISM OF CULTIVATING GROWTH MIND SET INVOLVES LEARNING TO ACCESS THE REWARDS FROM EFFORT AND DOING AND THAT'S HARD TO DO BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO ENGAGE THIS PREFRUNTAL COMPONENT OF THE MESILYMBIC CIRCUIT YOU HAVE TO TELL YOURSELF OCA THIS EFFORT IS GREAT THIS EFFORT IS PLEASUREFUL EVEN THOUGH YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY BE IN A STATE OF PHYSICAL PAIN FROM THE EXERCISE OR I CAN RECALL THIS FROM COLLEGE JUS FEELING LIKE I WONE TO GET UP FROM MY DESK BUT FORCING MYSELF TO STUDY FORCING MYSELF AN FORCING MYSELF WHAT YOU FIND OVER TIME IS THT YOU CAN START TO ASSOCIATE AT DOPAMING RELEASE YOU CAN EVOKE DOPAMIN RELEASE FROM THE FRICTION AND THE CHALLENGE THAT YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN YOU COMPLETELY ELIMINATE THE ABILITY TO GENERATE THOSE CIRCUITS AND REWARDING PROCESS OF BEING ABLE TO REWARD FRICTION WHILE IN EFFORT IF YOU ARE FOCUS ONLY ON THE GOAL THAT COMES AT THE END BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT DOPAMIN MARKS TIME SO IF YOU SAY OH I AM GOING TO DO THIS VERY HARD THING AND WHEN A PUSH AND PUSH AND PUSH AND PUSH FOR THAT ENGOAL THAT COMES LATER NOT ONLY DO YOU ENJOY THE PROCESS OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING LESS YOU ACTUALLY MAKE IT MORE PAINFUL WHILE YOU'RE ENGAGING IN IT YOU MAKE YOURSELF LESS EFFICIENT AT IT BECAUSE IF YOU WERE ABLE TO ACCESS DOPAMEAN WHILE IN EFFORT DOPAMINE HAS ALWHAYS INCREDIBLE PROPERTIES OF INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY IN OUR BODY AND IN OUR MIND ARE ABILITY TO FOCUS BY WAY OF DOPAMENES CONVERSION INTO EPIN EFFERN BUT ALSO YOU ARE UNDERMINING YOUR ABILITY TO LEAN BACK INTO THAT ACTIVITY THE NEXT TIME THE NEXT TIME YOU NEED TWICE AS MUCH COFFEE AND THREE TIMES AS MUCH LOUD MUSIC AND FOUR TIMES AS MUCH ENERGY DRINK AND THE SOCIAL CONNECTION JUST TO GET OUT THE DOOR IN ORDER TO DO THE RUN OR TO STUDY SO WHAT'S MORE BENEFICIAL IN FACT CAN SERVE AS A TREMENDOUS AMPLIFIER ON ALL ENDEAVORS THAT YOU ENGAGE IN ESPECIALLY HARD ENDEAVORS IS TO AY NOT START LAYERING IN OTHER SOURCES OF DOPAMINE IN ORDER TO GET TO THE STARTING LINE NOT LAYERING IN OTHER SOURCES OF DOPAMINE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE BUT RATHER TO SUBJECTIVELY START TO ATTACH THE FEELING OF FRICTION AND EFFORT TO AN INTERNALLY GENERATED REWARD SYSTEM AND THIS IS NOT MEN TO BE VAGUE THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT EXISTS IN YOUR MIND THAT IT EXISTS IN THE MINDS OF HUMANS FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS BY WHICH YOURE NOT JUST PURSUING THE THINGS THAT ARE INNATELY PLEASUREFUL FOOD SECTS WARMTH WATER WHEN YOU'RE THIRSTY BUT THE BEAUTY OF THIS MISOLIMBIC REWARD PATHWAY THAT I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IS THAT IT INCLUDES THE FOREBRAIN SO YOU CAN TELL YOURSELF THE EFFORT PART IS THE GOOD PART I KNOW ITS PAINFUL I KNOW THIS DOESN'T FEEL GOOD BUT I'M FOCUSSED ON THIS I'M GOING TO START TO ACCESS THE REWARD YOU WILL FIND THE REWARDS MEANING THE DOPAMINE RELEASE INSIDE OF EFFORT IF YOU REPEAT THIS OVER AN OVER AGAIN AND WHAT'S BEAUTIFUL ABOUT IT IS THAT IT STARTS TO BECOME REFLECTIVE FOR ALL TYPES OF EFFORT WHEN WE FOCUS ONLY ON THE TROPHY ONLY ON THE GRADE ONLY ON THE WIN AS THE REWARD YOU UNDERMINE THAT ENTIRE PROCESS SO HOW DO YOU DO THIS YOU DO THIS IN THOSE MOMENTS OF THE MOST INTENSE FRICTION YOU TELL YOURSELF THIS IS VERY PAINFUL AND BECAUSE IT'S PAINFUL IT WILL EVOKE AND INCREASE IN DOPAMINE RELEASE LATER MEANING IT WILL INCREASE MY BASE LINE IN DOPAMING BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO TELL YOURSELF THAT IN THAT MOMENT YOU ARE DOING IT BY CHOICE AND YOUR DOING IT BECAUSE YOU LOV IT AND I KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE LINE TO YOURSELF AND IN SOME WAYS IT IS LYING TO YOURSELF BUT IT'S LINE TO YOURSELF IN THE CONTEXT OF A TRUTH WHICH IS THAT YOU WANT IT TO FEEL BETTER YOU WANT IT TO FEEL EVEN PLEASUREFUL NOW THIS IS VERY FAR AND AWAY DIFFERENT FROM THINKING ABOUT THE REWARD THAT COMES AT THE END THE HOTFUDGE SUNDAY FOR AFTER YOU CROSS THE FINISH LINE AND YOU CAN REPLACE HOTFLUDG SUNDAY WITH WHATEVER REWARD HAPPENS TO TO BE APPEALING TO YOU WE REVERE PEOPLE WHO ARE CAPABLE OF DOING WHAT I'M DESCRIBING DEVIGOGANS COMES TO MIND AS A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH DAVIGOGANS FORMER NAVY SEAL WHO ESENTIALLY HAS MADE A POST MILITARY CARE EAR CAREER OUT OF EEXPLAINING AND SHARING HIS PROCESS OF TURNING THE EFFORT INTO THE REWARD THERE ARE MANY OTHER EXAMPLES OF THIS TOO OF COURSE THROUGHOUT EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WE REVERED PEOPLE WHO WERE WILLING TO GO OUT AN FORAGE AND HUNT AND GATHER AND CARETAKE IN WAYS THAT OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR SPECIES PROBABLY FOUND EXHAUSTING AND PROBABLY WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO JUST PUT THEIR FEED UP OR SOAKED THEM IN A COOL STREAM RATHER THAN CONTINUE TO FORAGE THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THIS PLEASURE FROM EFFORT ASPECT OF OUR DOPAMINERGICT CIRCUITRY IS WITHOUT QUESTION THE MOST POWERFUL ASPECT OF DOPAMINE AND OUR BIOLOGY OF DOPAMINE AND THE BEAUTIFUL THING IS ITS ACCESSIBLE TO ALL OF US BUT JUST A HIGHLIGHT THE THINGS THAT CAN INTERFERE WITH AND PREVENT YOU FROM GETTING DOAMINE RELEASE FROM EFFORT ITSELF DON'T SPIKE DOPAMINE PRIOR TO ENGAGING AN EFFORT AND DON'T SPIKE DOAMINE AFTER ENGAGING AN EFFORT LEARN TO SPIKE YOUR DOPAMINE FROM EFFRT ITSELF ONE STRAIGHTFORWARD EXAMPLE OF LEARNING TO ATTACHED DOPAMINE TO EFFORT AND STRAIN AS OPPOSED TO A PROCESS OR A REWARD THAT NATURALLY EVOKES DOPAMIN RELEASE IS SO CALLED INTERMITTEN FASTING I KNOW THIS IS VERY POPULAR NOWADAYS SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO DO INTERMITTEN FASTING SOME PEOPLE DON'T SOME PEOPLE HAVE A TWELVE HOUR FEEDING WINDOW EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS SOME PEOPLE DO LONG FASTS OF TWO TO THREE DAYS EVEN I PERSONALLY DON'T MONITOR A FEEDING WINDOW WITH A LOT OF PRECISION I TEND TO SKIP ONE MEAL A DAY EITHER BREAKFAST OR LUNCH AND THEN I EAT THE OTHER TWO MEALS OF THE DAY DEPENDING ON WHICH MEALI GEP SOS EITHER BREAKFAST LUNCH ON MAY BE LIL SOMETHING IN THE EVENING OR I'LL SKET BREAKFAST AND DO LAUNCH IN DINNER AND SO ON MANY PEOPLE ARE NOW EATING THIS WAY IN PART BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE FIND IT EASIER TO NOT EAT AT ALL THEN TO EAT A SMALLER PORTION OF SOME FOOD AND THAT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE DOPAMINE REWARD EVOKING PROPERTIES OF FOOD WHEN WE INJEST FOOD OR WHEN WE ARE ABOUT TO INJEST FOOD OUR DOPAMI LEVELS GO UP AND TYPICALLY WHEN WE INJEST FOOD IF IT DEVOKES SOME DOPAMING RELEASE THAN WE TEND TO WANT EVEN MORE FOOD REMEMBER DOAMINES MAIN ROLL IS ONE OF MOTIVATION AND SEEKING AND WHAT DOPAMINE ALWAYS WANTS MORE OF IS MORE DOPAMINE MORE ACTIVITY OR THING THAT EVOKES MORE DOPAMIN RELEASE WELL LET'S JUST LOOK AT FASTING FROM THE PRERSPECTIVE OF DOPAMINE SCHEDULES AND DOPAMING RELEASE AND PEAKS AND BASE LONTS TYPICALLY WHEN WE EAT WE GET DOPAMIN RELEASE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE EAT AFTER BEING VERY HUNGRY IF YOU EVER GONE CAMPING OR REVERY VERY HUNGRY THE FOOD TASTE THAT MUCH BETTER AND THAT'S ACTUALLY BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT DEPRIVATION STATES INCREASE THE WAY THAT DOPAMINURGICT CIRCUITS WORK OUR PERCEPTION OF DOPAMINE IS HEIGHTENED WHEN THE RECEPTERS FOR DOPAMNE HAVE NOT SEEN MUCH DOPAMINE LATELY THEY HAVEN'T BOUND MUCH DOPAMINE SO WHEN YOU FAST FAST FAST FAST FAST AND THEN YOU FINALLY EAT IT EVOKES MORE DOPAMINE RELEASE SO THIS IS THE BIG REWARD THAT COMES AT THE END EVEN BIGGER BECAUSE YOU DEPRIVED YOURSELF THIS IS TRUE FOR ALL REWARDING BEHAVIORS AND ACTIVITIES BY THE WAY THE LONGER YOU RESTRICT YOURSELF FROM THAT ACTIVITY THE GREATER THE DOPAMINE EXPERIENCE WHEN THE DOPAMINE IS FINALLY RELEASE BECAUSE OF AN UPREGULATION OF THE RECEPTORS FOR DOPAMI BUT I JUST SPEND FIVE MINUTES OR MORE TELLING YOU THAT YOU SHOULD AVOID TOO MUCH REWARD AT THE END AND YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY FOCUS ON THE DOPAMIN THAT YOU CAN CONSCIOUSLY EVOKE FROM THE DEPROVATION STRAIN AND EFFORT AND IN FACT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS FOR MANY PEOPLE THAT START DOING FASTING AND TAKE A LIKING TO IT MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT THEIR STATE OF MIND WHEN THEY FAST IS CLEARER THAT THEY ACTUALLY STARE TO ENJOY THE PERIOD OF FASTING IN FACT SOME PEOPLE START PUSHING OUT THEIR EATING WINDOW OR SKIPPING ENTIRE DAYS OF EATING MORE AND MORE IN ORDER TO GET DEEPER INTO THAT STATE OF MIND WHERE SURELY IT'S NOT JUST DOPAMINE BUT DOAMINE IS RELEASED THEY WILL TRACT THEIR CLOCK OH HAVE BEEN FASTING TWELVE HOUR SIXTEEN HOURS ET CETERA THEY ARE STARTING TO ATTACH DOPAMINE RELEASE OR CREATE DOPAMINE RELEASE FROM THE DEPRIVATION NOT FROM THE FOOD REWARD ITSELF AND THIS I THING MAKES IT AN INTERESTING PRACTISE IND ONE THAT CERTAINLY HAS BEEN O PRACTISE BY FOR CENTURIES IN DIFFERENT CULTURES AND IFFERENT RELIGIONS OF DELIBERATELY RESTRICTING FOOD NOT JUST TO INCREASE THE REWARDING PROPERTIES OF FOOD ITSELF BUT ALSO TO INCREASE THE REWARDING PROPERTIES OF DEPRIVATION AND I SHOULD EMPHASIZE THAT A LOT OF THE SUBJECTIVE ASPECTS OF THE NOWLEDGE OF THE BENEFITS OF FASTING SERVE AS REENFORCING DOPAMIN AMPLIFYING ASPECTS TO FASTING MEANING IF SOMEBODY DOES INTERMITTEN FASTING AND THEY ARE DEEP INTO THEIR FAST AND THEIR TELLING THEMSELVES OH MY BLOODLIPID PROFILES ARE PROBABLY IMPROVING AND MI GLUCOS MANAGEMENT IS PROBABLY IMPROVING MY INSOLENT SENSITIVITY IS GOING UP AND AM AN A LIVE LONGER ALL THESE THINGS THAT HAVE SOME BASIS FROM ANIMAL STUDIES AND SOME BASIS OR NOT FROM HUMAN STUDIES ITS ALL KIND OF STILL AN EMERGING LITERATURE BUT IT DOES SEEM TO BE POINTING IN THAT DIRECTION THAT FASTING CAN ENCOURAGE THINGS LIKE AUTOPHAGE THE ENGULFMENT OF DEAD CELLS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT WELL AS PEOPLE TELL THEMSELVES THESE THINGS THEY ARE ENHANCING THE REWARDING PROPERTIES OF THE BEHAVIOR OF FASTING AND SO THIS IS A SALIENT EXAMPLE OF WHERE KNOWLEDGE OF KNOWLEDGE CAN ACTUALLY HELP US CHANGE THESE DEEP PRIMITIVE CIRCUITS FRELATED TO DOPAMINE AND THIS ILLUSTRATES HOW THE FOREBRAIN WHICH CARRIES KNOWLEDGE AND CARRIES INTERPRETATION AND RATIONAL THOUGHT CAN BE USED TO SHAPE THE VERY CIRCUITS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN GENERATING RE WARD FOR WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE JUST BE KIND OF PRIMITIVE BEHAVIORS HARD WIRED BEHAVIORS AND THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF THESE DOPAMINE CIRCUITS THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF DOPAMINE IT'S NOT JUST ATTACHED TO THE MORE PRIMITIVE BEHAVIORS OF FOOD SEX HEAT ET CETERA IT'S ALSO ATTACHED TO THE THINGS THT WE DECIDE AR GOOD FOR US AND OUR IMPORTANT FOR US SO TELLING YOURSELF THAT EXERCISE OR FASTING OR STUDYING OR LISTENING BETTER OR ANY KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS GOOD FOR YOU WILL ACTUALLY REENFORCE THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT IS GOOD FOR YOU AT A CHEMICAL LEVEL AND ASSOMEWHAT ERIE EXAMPLE OF WHAT I JUST MENTION WAS A STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHED LAST YEAR IN THE JOURNAL NURON SELPRESS JOURNAL EXCELLENT JOURNAL THAT SHOWED THAT HEARING SOMETHING THAT REENFORCES ONE'S PRIOR BELIEFS ACTUALLY CAN EVOKE DOPAMNE RELEASE SO THE DOPAMINE PATHWAY IS SO VULNERABLE TO SUBJECTIVE INTERPRETATION THAT IT ACTUALLY MAKES IT SUCH THAT WHEN WE SEE SOMETHING OR HEAR SOMETHING THAT VALIDATES A BELIEF THAT WE ALREADY HAVE THAT ITSELF CAN INCREASE DOPAMINE RELEASE ALONG THE LINES OF HOW DOPAMINE AND DOPAMINE SCHEDULS AND OUR PERCEPTION OF THINGS CAN SHAPE THE WAY THAT WE EXPERIENCE THINGS AS PLEASUREFUL OR NOT THEIR BEAUTIFUL STUDIES MAINLY LOOKING AT SUGAR APPETITE AND OUR SENSE OF PLEASURE FROM SWEET THINGS BUT ALSO FOR SAVORY FOODS ET CETERA AND ESSENTIALLY THE RESULTS THAT COME OUT OF THIS ARE THE FOLLOWING IF YOU INJEST SOMETHING THAT YOU LIKE IT TAKES GOOD TO YOU BUT THEN YOU INJEST SOMETHING THAT'S EVEN SWEETER OR EVEN MORE SAVORY AND THEN YOU GO BACK TO THE FOOD THAT YOU ATE PREVIOUSLY WELL YOU DON'T LIKE IT AS MUCH AND THAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE A DA OBVIOUSLY BUT THAT SHIFT IN PERCEPTION CAN BE BLOCKED BY BLOCKING THE SHIFT IN DOPAMINE AND SO THIS REALLY SPEAKS TO THESE PEAKS AND VALLEYS IN DOPAMING THAT I MENTION BEFORE AND HOW YOUR EXPERIENCE OF ANYTHING IS GOING TO DEPEND ON YOUR PRIOR EXPERIENCE OF OTHER THINGS THAT EVOKE DOPAMINE BIG DOPAMINE RELEASE MAKES IT MORE CHALLENGING TO EXPERIENCE MORE BIG DOPAMINE RELEASE SO DOPAMINE IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU DON'T WANT TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW FOR TOO LONG IT'S ALL ABOUT STAYING IN THAT DYNAMIC RANGE AND THAT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FOR EVERYBODY SO FOR THE VERY SAVORY FOODS THAT ARE NOW EVERYWHERE THOSE HIGHLY SAVORY FOODS ORE I THINK THEY CALL THEM HIGHLY PALATABLE FOODS ARE MAKING MORE BLAND FOODS WHOLE FOODS MEANING FOODS THAT AREN'T PROCESS IT'S MAKING THOSE TASTE LESS GOOD AT LEAST FOR A WHILE AND ALL IT TAKES IS A SHORT BERIOD OF TIME EVEN JUST DAYS TWO DAYS OR SO OF NOT CONSUMING ANY HIGHLY PALTABLE FOODS AND SUDDENLY BROCKLY WITH JUST A LOPIT OF SEASONING TASTE DELICIOUS TO YOU RI SO AGAIN THIS JUST SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT DOPAMINE IS THIS UNIVERSAL CURRENCY IT ESTABLISHES VALUE BASED ON NOT JUST WHAT YOUR EXPERIENCING THE MOMENT BUT WHAT YOU EXPERIENCE IN THE DA YS AND MINUTES BEFORE NOW THAT YOU UNDERSTAND HOW YOUR PREVIOUS LEVEL OF DOPOMINE RELATES TO YOUR CURRENT LEVEL OF DOPOMINE AND HOW YOUR CURRENT LEVEL OF DOPOMINE WILL INFLUENCE YOUR FUTURE LEVEL OF DOPOMINE IT SHOULD BECOME OBVIOUS WHY THINGS LIKE PORNOGRAPHY NOT JUST THE ACCESSIBILITY OF PORNOGRAPHY BUT THE INTENSITY OF PORNOGRAPHY CAND NEGATIVELY SHAPE REAL WORLD ROMANTIC AND SECUAL INTERACTIONS THIS IS A SERIOUS CONCERN THE DISCUSSION IS HAPPENING NOW THE UNDERLINE NOROBIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS YOU NOW UNDERSTAND AND THIS IS IN TO PASS JUDGMENT ON WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE LIKE OR DON'T LIKE PONOGRAPHY THES ANETHICAL DISCUSSION AS H MORAL DISCUSSION THAT HAS TO BE DECIDED FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL BUT VIRTUE OF AGE ET CETERA BUT AGAIN ANY ACTIVITY THAT EVOKES A LOT OF DOPOMINE RELEASE WILL MAKE IT HARDER TO ACHIEVE THE SAME LEVEL AND CERTAINLY THE GREATER LEVEL OF DOOMINE THROUGH A SUBSEQUENT INTERACTION SO YES INDEED MANY PEOPLE ARE ADDICTED TO PORNOGRAPHY AND YES INDEED MANY PEOPLE WHO REGULARLY INDULGE IN PORNOGRAPHY EXPERIENCE CHALLENGES IN REAL WORLD ROMANTIC INTERACTIONS YOU NOW UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS BEHIND WHAT IAM TELLING YOU NOW THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH INCREASING LEVELS OF DOPOMINE IS DESIRABLE AND ADVANTAGEOUS AND CLINICALLY HELPFUL GOOD EXAMPLE THIS WOULD BE THE DRUG WILL BEUTRIN ALSO CALL BUPRIRON WHICH INCREASES DOPOMINE AND NOREPINEFREN WHILE BEUTRUN BROPRIRON WAS DEVELOPED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE WHO TAKE THE SO CALLED ESCESS OR EYES SELECTIVE CERETONAN REUPTAKN HIBITERS WHICH AS THE NAME SUGGESTS INCREASE CERAPTONEN SUFFER FROM CERATONAN RELATED SIDE EFFECTS THINGS LIKE DECREASED APPETITE DECREASE LEBIDO OR SOMETIMES INCREASED APPETITE OR OTHER SIDE AFFECTS THAT THEY DON'T WANT AND WILE BEUTRIN SEEMS TO AVOID THE SEXUAL SIDE EFFECTS IT CAN BLUNT AT APPETITE AND THESE SORTS OF THINGS BECAUSE OF THE INCREASE IN NOREPINEFREN AND DOPOMINE INCREASES LEVELS OF MOTIVATION AND CRAVING BUT ALSO CAN CREATE A STATE OF ELEVATED ALERTNESS THAT CAN SOMETIMES GET IN THE WAY OF HEALTHY EATING AND THINGS OF THAT SORT SO ONE HAS TO WORK WITH THERE CLINITION AS PSYCHATRIS IT IS A PRESCRIPTION DRUG IN ORDER TO FIND THE DOSAGE OF WOPBEUTRIN THAT'S CORRECT FOR THEM IN ADDITION THINGS LIKE WELE BEUCHRUN BROPRIRON CAN INCREASE ANXIETY BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT DOPOMINE AND NOREPINEFREON ARE STIMULATING AN TEND TO PLACE PEOPLE INTO HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF ALERTNESS NONE THE LESS MANY PEOPLE HAVE GAINED TERRIFIC RELIEF FROM DEPRESSION FROM WELL BEUTRUM BROPRIRON AND MANY OF THOSE SAME PEOPLE HAD SERIOUS TROUBLE WITH SOME OF THE ESCESSOR EYES SO DOES SEEM TO BE A VERY USEFUL DRUG IN CERTAIN CONTECTS BOTH FOR DEPRESSION AND FOR THE TREATMENT OF SMOKING FOR PEOPLE DESIRING TO QUIT SMOKING AND OF COURSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE SEEKING TO INCREASE THEIR BASE LINE LEVELS OF DOPOMINE WITHOUT TAKING ANY PRESCRIPTION FORM A SUITICAL COMPOUNDS AND NOWADAYS THERE EXIST A LOT OF SUPPLEMENTS TO DO THAT THE TWO MOST COMMON ONES THAT ARE DIRECTLY WITHIN THE DOPAMINE PATHWAY ARE MACUNIPURINES WHICH IS ACTUALLY A VELVETY BEIN WHOSE CONTENTS OR EL DOPA BELIEVE IT ARE NOT THE CONTENTS OF THIS BEING IS THE PRECURSOR TO DOPAMINE SO MACUNIPURINS IS SOLD OVER THE COUNTER AT LEAST IN THE UNITED STATES AND IT LITERALLY IS THE PRECURSOR DO DOPAMINE MEANING IF YOU TAKE IT YOU WILL EXPERIENCE VERY LARGE INCREASES IN DOPAMINE THOSE INCREASES ARE TRANSIENT AND VERY VERY INTENTS AND IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE CONSTELLATION OF EFFECTS OF MACUNIPURINES WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT THEIR PRETTY STRIKING AND THEY LOOK A LOT LIKE IF NOT IDENTICAL TO AL DOPA THE MOST OBVIOUS OF THOSE IS IN THE CONTEXTS OF PARKINSAN'S DISEASE THERE RE AT LEAST FIVE STUDIES THAT HAVE SHOWN THAT MACUNIPURINES CAN REDUCE THE SYMPTOMS OF PARKINSONS DISEASE MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT ALDOPA CAN REDUCE THE SYMPTOMS OF PARKINSONS DISEASE AN ACTION COME AS ANY SURPRISE GIVEN WHAT I JUST TOLD YOU THAT MACUNIPERINS IS ESSENTIALLY AL DOPA IT ALSO CAN REDUCE A PARTICULAR HORMON CULL PROLACTIN DOPAMINE AND PROLACTINTEND TO BE IN SOMEWHAT PUSHPOL FASHION WHEN DOPAMINE IS UP PROLACTIN IS DOWN AND VISEVERSA PROLACTIN IS INVOLVED IN MILK LET DOWN IN WOMEN ITS INVOLVED IN SETTING THE REFRACTORY PERIOD FOR A SEXTS AFTER EJACTULATION IN MALES THE REASON MEANING CAN OCCUR AND THEN NOT OCUR AFTER EJACULATION IS BECAUSE OF AN INCREASE IN PROLACTIN MACUNIPURINES ZOPHEN USED TO BRUNT BLUNT PROLACTIN AND THEIRE ACTUALLY COUPLE OF STUDIES SHOWING THAT IT CAN INDEED DO THAT MCUNIPURINS HAS A NUMBER OF OTHER EFFECTS THAT LIE IN THE SEC ON REPRODUCTION PATHWAY THAT ARE WORTH NOTING SPERM CONCENTRATION SPERM QUALITY IS ACTUALLY GREATLY INCREASED BY MACUNIPURINES THESE ARE KOND OF CURIOUS AFFECTS UNTIL YOU UNDERSTAND A LIMET MORE ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF DOPAMINE WHICH ALL MENTION IN A MOMENT BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL STUDIES A FOR IN FACT THAT DESCRIBE HOW MACUNIPURINS CAN INCREASE SPERM COUNT SPERM QUALITY AND SPERM MOTILITY SO FOR THOSE OF YOU SEEKING TO CONCEIVE CHILDREN A MACUNIPURINS MIGHT BEAN INTERESTING CHOICE IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN EXPLORING NON PRESCRIPTION COMPOUNDS HOWEVER I SHOULD MENTION THAT ANY TIME YOU CONSUME A SUBSTANCE THAT INCREASES DOPAMINE BY MIMICING DOPAMINE OR ACTING IS A DIRECT PRECURSOR TO DOPAMINE THERE'S ALMOST INNEVITABLY A CRASH OR A REDUCTION IN THE BASE LINE IN DOPAMINE THAT WE REFERR TO PREVIOUSLY SO MANY PEOPLE WHO TAKE MACUNIPURINES FEEL REALLY ELEVATED REALLY MOTIVATED REALLY ALERT ALL THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT ONE WOULD EXPECT FROM A DOPAM AND URGICT DRUG WHICH MACUNIPURINES IS AND THEN THEY FEEL A LOW OR A REDUCTION IN DRIVE IN EXCITEMENT AND ENTHUSIASM AFTER THE DRUG WARS OFF JUST LIKE THEY WOULD WITH ANY OTHER DOPAMINE INCREASING COMPOUND FOR THAT REASON MANY PEOPLE HAVE TURNED TO THE USE OF EL TYRASINE ELTIRASINE IS AN A MENOACID PRECURSER TO ELDOPA SO IS LIES FURTHER UP THE DOPAMINE CENTHISIS PATHWAY AND NOWADAYS ITS VERY COMMON BECAUSE ALTYRASINE ASSAULT OVER THE COUNTER IN THE UNITED STATES THAT PEOPLE WILL TAKE ELTIRASINE AS A WAY TO GET MORE ENERGIZED ALERT AND POCUS ANDINDEED THERE ARE DATA THAT ELTIRASINE WILL ACCOMPLISH THAT ELTYRASINE IS TYPICALLY TAKEN IN CAPSAL FORM OR POWDER FORM ANYWHERE FROM FIVE HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY TO A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS IT IS A POTENT STIMULUS FOR INCREASING DOPAMINE AND THE TIME SKIL FOR INCREASING DOPAMINE IS ABOUT THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE MINUTES AFTER INGESTION DOPAMING LEVEL START TO PEAK THE CLASSIC STUDY THAT REALLY NAIL DOWN THE FACT THAT TYRASINE HAS THIS EFFECT WAS PUBLISHD WAYBACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE JOURNAL CLINICAL AND A CHRONOLOGY A METABOLISM THAT DIRECTLY COMPARED ELTRASINE SUPPLEMENTATION WITH TRIPDOPHAN INGESTION ON PLASMADOPAMINE AND  AN SERATONEN TRIPDIFPAN BEING A PRECURSER TO SERATONAN AND INDEED WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT INGESTION OF ALTYRASINE CAN INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DOPAMINE CIRCULATING IN THE BLOOD AND IN THE BRAIN TOO OF COURSE THE TYRASINE INGESTION INDUCED DOPAMING INCREASES WITHIN FORTY FIVE MINUTES AND THEY WERE SHORT LASTING AFTER ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES THE EFFECT HAD DISSIPATED MEANING THE LEVELS OF DOPAMINE HAD DROPPED DOWN TO BASE LINE AND EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T LOOK AT LEVELS OF BASELINE DOPAMINE PAST THAT TIME POINT THE EXPECTATION BASED ON EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT DOPAMING BIOLOGIES THAT IT WOULD THEN DROP BLOBASELINE DU TO THE DEPLETION OF THE READILY RESERVABLE POOL OF DOPAMING VESICLES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WAY BACK AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EPISODE NICEING ABOUT THE STUDY IS A DOES SHOW SPECIFICITY OF EFFECT BECAUSE INGESTION OF TRIPDOPHAN DID NOT INCREASE DOPAMINE INSTEAD IT INCREASED SERATONEN SO THERE'S REALLY SPECIFICITY THESE PATHWAYS THAT RULE OUT AN PLACIBO TYPE OFFECTS I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT ANYBODY EVERYBODY INCREASE THEIR DOAMING LEVELS BY WAY OF TYRASINE OMACURE MACUNOPURIANS OF FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE SEEKING TO INCREASE YOUR DOPAMING LEVELS WITHOUT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THOSE ARE THE MOST DIRECT ROUTE TO THAT OF COURSE IF YOU HAVE A PRE EXISTING DOPAMINURGENT CONDITION SO IGETS A FRENDIOR PCSYCHOSIS OF ANY KIND BY POLER ANXIETY THINGS LIKE MACUNIPERIANS AND ALTYRASINE WILL NOT BE GOOD FOR YOU AND IF YOU DON'T YOU SHOULD JUST UNDERSTAND AND EXPECT THAT IT'S GOING TO LEAD TO AND INCREAS IN DOPAMINE YOU'LL CERTAINLY FEEL AN ELEVATED STATE FOR SOME OF YOU THAT MIGHT BE AGITATING FOR SOME OF YOU THAT MIGHT BE REALLY PLEASUREFUL AND THEN YOU WILL FEEL A CRASH AFTERWARDS HOW DEEP IS THAT CRASH WILL REALLY DEPEND ON YOUR BYAL LOGY AND WHERE YOUR DOPAMING BASE LINE BEGAN SO I PERSONALLY AM NOT A FAN OF USING THINGS LIKE MACUN APPEARIENCE AT ALL FOR MYSELF FOR THE REASON I MENTIONED EARLIER JUST TWO INTENSE AND TOO MUCH OF A CRASH I DO USE ALTIRASINE FROM TIME TO TIME FOR ENHANCING FOCUS IN MOTIVATION BUT I WANT EMPHASIZE FROM TIME TO TIME SO MIGHT USE IT ONCE A WEEK OCCASIONALLY TWICE A WEEK BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN ONE TO TAKE ALTYRASINE REGULARLY IN ORDER TO FOCUS OR TRAIN OR DO ANY KIND OF MENTAL WORK I JUST DON'T WANT A RELI ON ANY EXOGINOUS SUBSTANCE IN ORDER TO GET MY DOPAMIN CIRCUITS ACTIVATED AND I DON'T WANT TO EXPERIENCE THE DROP IN DOPAOMINE THAT INEVITABLY OCCURS SOME PERIOD OF TIME AFTERWARDS I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THINGS THAT CAN REDUCE YOUR LEVELS OF BASELIME DOPAMING ONE THAT IS RARELY DISCUSTED IS MELATONAN I HAVE TALKED BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT MELATONAN WHY I AM NOT A FAN OF USING MELATONAN IN ORDER TO ENHANCE SLEEP IT CAN HELP ONE GETS O SLEEP BUT NOT STAY ASLEEP DOCTOR MATT WALKER SLEEP EXPERT FROM UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA BIRKLY I THINK I DON'T WANT IT A BUT WORDS IN HIS MOUTH BUT IN OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT MELATONAN ON THIS PODCAST WHEN MAT WAS A GUEST AND HIS BOOK IN ONOTHER PODCAS MAT HAS GENERALLY STATED THAT THE USE OF MELATONAN EXCEPT FOR TREATMENT OF JET LAG IS GENERALLY NOT A GOOD IDEA AND I I AGREE I THINK THAT MELATONAN IS NOT OFTEN THOUGHT ABOUT AS IMPACTING THE DOPOMIN PATHWAY BUT THERE'S AT LEAST ONE STUDY O'M PUBLISHING TWO THOUSAND ONE FOR ST AUTHORIS NICHIAMA JUST AS IT SOUNDS ITIS BUT IT SPELL JUST AS IT SOUNDS ACUTIFECTS OF MELATONAN MINISTRATION ON CARTY OFASCULAR AUTONOMIC REGULATION AN HEALTHY MEN SO THE STUDY WASN'T SPECIFICALLY ABOUT DOPAMING BUT THEY LOOKED AT NOROP AND AFFRAN AN DOPAMING LEVELS AND THEY FOUND A SIGNIFICANT STETITICALLY SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN DOPAMING SIXTY MINUTES AFTER MELATONAN ADMINISTRATION I'VE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT HOW VIEWING BRIGHT LIGHTS BETWEEN THE HOURS OF TEN P M AND FOR  M HAS BEEN SHOWN AN STUDIES BY DOCTOR SANT MERHOTARE DAVID BURST IN EXCELLENT CIRCADIAN SCIENTISTS TO REDUCE LEVELS OF DOPOMING FOR SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THAT LIGHT EXPOSURE SO DIM THE LIGHTS AT NIGHT IF YOU CAN AVOID EXOGEONOUS MELATONAN MEANING IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE MELATONAN AND YOU CAN FIND A BETTER ALTERNTIVE THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA IF YOU WANT TA MAINTAIN HEALTHY LEVELS OF DOPAMING NOW THERE IS ONE COMPOUND THAT YOU ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH AND YOU PROBABLY ACTUALLY TAKEN WITHOUT REALIZING IT THAT INCREASES DOPOMINE AND THAT SOMETHING CALLED P E A FOR FENAL ETHELAMING TECHNICALLY BATA FENAL ETHELAMING AND P A IS FOUND IN VARIOUS FOODS CHOCOLATE JUST HAPPENS TO BE WONE IN ENRICHED IN P  A AND CAN INCREASE SYNAPTIC LEVELS OF DOPAMING I PERSONALLY TAKE P A FROM TIME TO TIME AS A FOCUS AND WORK AID IN ORDER TO DO INTENSE BOUTS OF WORK AGAIN I DON'T DO THAT TOO OFTEN THIS MIGHT BE ONCE A WEEK OR ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS I MIGHT USE IT FOR TRAINING BUT TYPICALLY I I DON'T ITS USUALLY FOR MENTAL WORK AND I WILL TAKE FIVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF P A AND I'LL TAKE THREE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF ALPHAG P C THAT SOMETHING THAT I PERSONALLY DO THAT'S WHAT'S RIGHT FOR ME IT'S WITHIN MY MARGINS OF SAFETY FOR MY HEALTH AGAIN YOU HAVE TO CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTRINE TO SIDE WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU IT LEADS TO A SHARP BUT VERY TRANSIENT INCREASE IN DOPAMINE THAT LAST ABOUT THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE MINUTES AND AT LEAST IN MY SYSTEM I FOUND TO BE MUCH MORE A REGULATED AND KIND OF EVEND THAN SOMETHING LIKE ALTIRASINE AND CERTAINLY MUCH MORE REGULATED AND EVEN AND LOWER DOPOMINE RELEASE THAN SOMETHING LIKE MACUNIPURINES ONE OF THE LESSER TALKED ABOUT COMPOUNDS THATS OUT THERE BUT THAT'S GAINING POPULARITY FOR INCREASING DOPOMINE AND AS THE SO CALLED NEUTROPIC IS SOMETHING CALLED HOOPERSNE A HOOPERSINE A IS A COMPOUND SOLD OVER THE COUNTER AT LEAST IN THE UNITED STATES THAT CAN INCREASE A SEETOCOLINE TRANSMISSION A DIFFERENT NERMOGULATOR ENTIRELY BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT HOOPERSINEA SOMEHOW BY WAY OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE COLONERGIC SYSTEM AND THE DOPAMANURGIC SYSTEM LEADS TO INCREASES IN DOPAMIN IN THE MEDEO PREFUNTAL QUARTECS AND HIPPOCAMPUS HYPPOCAMPUS OF COURSE BEING AN AREA OF THE BRAIN ASSOCIATE WITH LEARNING IN MEMORY AND PREVENTAL QUARTEC BEING ASSOCIATE WITH THE MUSOLYMBIC PATHWAY DECISION MAKING FOCUS ET CETERA AND SO I THINK THE REASON WHY WE'RE SEING AN INCREASE IN POPULARITY OF COMEPANIES INCLUDING HOOPERSINE A AND NEUTROPIC COMPOUNDS IS BOTH FOR THE COLONERGIC STIMULATING PROPERTIES BUT ALSO FOR STIMULATING DOPAMNE RELEASE I PERSONALL V NEVER TRIED HOOPERSINE YOU CAN GO TO EXAMINED OT COM OR PUT HOOPERSIN A INTO PUBMED IF YOU LIKE TO SEARCH AROUND AND SEE SOME OF THE SCIENCE BEHIND IT AGAIN I'M NOT RECOMMENDING ANYONE TAKE THESE THINGS IN FACT I RECOMMEND AGAINST ANYONE JUST DIVING IN AND STARTING TO CONSUME THINGS WITHOUT GAINING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW THEY FUNCTION WHETHER NOT THEIR RIGHT FOR YOU BUT NONE THE LESS I THINK IN THE YEARS TO COME WE ARE GOING TO SEE A LOT MORE OF ALTIROINE P E A FENAL ETHALAMINE AND HOOPERSINE AS A WAY OF TAPPING IN TO THE DOPOMONRGIC AND COLONERGIC CIRCUTS CERTAINLY ALONG WITH THINGS LIKE ALPHAG P C AS NONPRESCRIPTION SHORT LIVED SOMEWHAT MILD OR ALTERNATIVES TO THINGS THAT REALLY SPIKE DOPAMIN THINGS LIKE ADERAL RIDDLIN MODAPHANEL ARMODAPHANAL AND SIMILAR AND I CAN'T HELP BUT SHARE WITH YOU ONE MORE RESULT IT'S NOT RELATED TO FARM A COLOGY IT'S RELATED TO BEHAVIORS AND SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND THAT'S THE VERY INTERESTING AND I WOULD SAY IMPORTANT FINDING THAT WAS MADE A FEW YEARS AGO BY MY COLLEGUE ROBMALENCA IS NOUR DEPARTMENT PSYCHIATRI ET STAMFORD SHOWING THAT OXY TOSIN AND SOCIAL CONNECTION IS ACTUALLY DIRECTLY STIMULATING THE DOPAMINE PATHWAY I THINK FOR MANY YEARS ALL OF US INCLUDING ME WOULD HEAR AND THOUGHT THAT OXYTOSIN WAS IN THE CERATONRGIC PATHWAY THAT IT WAS ABOUT PERAB ONDING AND IT IS ABOUT SOME OF THESE NORMAGULAYERS THAT WERE MORE ASSOCIATED WITH THINGS RELATED TO FEELING GOOD WITH WHAT WE HAVE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT THAT'S TYPICALLY WHAT WE THINK OF WHEN WE THINK OF THE OPIOID SYSTEM OR THE CERTANERGIC SYSTEM THE DOPOMIN SYSTEM IS REALLY ABOUT SEEKING AND REWARD BUT IN A PAPER PUBLISH IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN THE JEURNAL SCIENCE EXCELLENT JOURNAL PAPERS TITLED GATING OF SOCIAL REWARD BY OXYTOSH TOSENS GIVES ME IN THE VENTUAL TAGMENTAL AREA YOU KNOW KNOW WHAT THE VENTURAL TAGMENTAL AREATS THAT AREA OF THE MESOLYMIC PATHWAY WHAT THIS PAPER ESSENTIALLY SHOWED IS THAT OXY TOSIN SOCIAL CONNECTION AND PERABONDING ITSELF TRIGGERS DOPAMINE RELEASE AND AS EVERYONE READ THIS RESULT WE ALL REALIZED AH THIS MAKES TOTAL SENSE THAT FOR THE EVOLUTION OF OUR SPECIES INDEED FOR ANY SPECIES WHERE SOCIAL CONNECTIONS ARE IMPORTANT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO GO SEEK SOCIAL CONNECTIONS AND SO WHILE IT'S FUND TO THINK ABOUT FHARMACHOLOGY AN UNDERLYING NERAL CIRCUITRY AND COLD WATER BATHS AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS RELATED TO DOPAMINE SCHEDULES AND REWARD MECHANISMS AND ATTACHING REWARD TO EFFORT AND ALL THE VARIOUS THINGS THT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TO DAY IN TERMS OF SCIENCE AND TOOLS AND PROTOCALS I BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T INCLUDE DESCRIPTION OF THIS RESULT AND JUST EMPHASIZED THAT SOCIAL CONNECTIONS CLOSE SOCIAL CONNECTIONS IN PARTICULAR THAT EVOKE OXYTOSE AND RELEASE SO THOSE ARE ROMANTIC TYPE THOSE ARE PARENT CHILD TYPE THOSE ARE FRIENDSHIP RELATED AND THOSE CAN EVEN BE JUST FRIENDS AT A DISTANCE RELATED RIGHT DOESN'T ACTUUL REQUIRE SKIN CONTACT TO GET OXYTOSEAN RELEASE BUT OYTOSE AND RELEASE IS SENTIAL TO STIMULATING THE DOPAMINE PATHWAYS SO THE TAKOMESSAGE THERS QUITE SIMPLE INGAGE IN PURSUE QUALITY HEALTHY SOCIAL INTERACTIONS I KNOW I'VE COVERED A LOT OF MATERIAL TO DAY I'VE REALY TRIED HARD TO PHOCUS ON THINGS THAT LIE DIRECTLY WITHIN THE DOPAMINE PATHWAY AND CIRCUITRIES AS WELL AS THINGS THAT DIRECTLY STIMULATE THOSE PATHWAYS AND CIRCUITRIES WHAT I HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT ARE ALL THE THINGS THAT INDIRECTLY SERVE THE DOPAMINE PATHWAYS AND OUT THERE ON THE INTERNET AND INDEED IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE YOU WILL FIND FOR INSTANCE THAT THINGS LIKE MACO ROOT CAN INCREASE DOPAMINE THINGS LIKE THE GOT MICROBIOM CAN INFLUENCE DOPAMINE AND INDEED THEY CAN BUT THEY DO THAT THROUGH INDIRECT MECHANISMS BY CREATING A ENVIRONMENT A MILEU IN WHICH DOPAMINE AND DOPAMINE CIRCUITS CAN FLOURISH MACA'S A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT IT WILL REDUCE CORDUSALL AND THROUGH SOME INDIRECT PATHWAYS RELATED TO CARTUS ALL CAN INCREASE DOPAMINE BUT IT'S NOT A DIRECT INCREASE IN DOPAMNE AND SO AS A CONSEQUENC ITS RATHER SUBTLE COMPARED TO THE VARIOUS COMPOUNDS AND BEHAVIORS THAT I TALKED ABOUT TO DAY INDEED COLD WATER EXPOSURE LEADS TO INHUGE INCREASES IN DOPAMINE AS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE AND VERY SUSTAINED ONES AT THAT I REALIZE IN GIVING YOU A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND MECHANISM ALL THE WAY FROM PSYCHOLOGICAL BIOLOGICAL TO URCUITRY AND SNAPTI TRANSMISSION VOLUMETRIC TRANSMISSION AND SO FORTH THAN MIGHT SEEM OVERWHELMING THE MOST IMPORTANT THNGS TO UNDERSTAND ARE THAT THESE DOPAMINE PATHWAYS REALLY ARE UNDER YOUR CONTROL AND THE LOCUST OF CONTROL RESIDES IN THE FACT THAT YOUR PREVIOUS LEVELS OF DOPAMINE ARE INFLUENCING YOUR LEVELS OF DOPAMINE RIGHT NOW AND YOUR CURRENT LEVELS OF DOPAMINE AND WHERE YOU TAKE THEM NEXT WILL INFLUENCE YOUR DOPAMINE LEVELS IN THE NEXT DAYS AND WEEKS TO COME SO I HOPE BOTH WITH THE MECHANISMS THAT YOU NOW HAVE IN HAND PLUFS SOME OF THE TOOLS THO TAP IN TO THE DOPAMANURGIC SYSTEM BOTH BEHAVIOR OL FARMACOLOGIC PRESCRIPTION AND NON PRESCRIPTION ET CETERA THAT YOU'LL FEEL THAT YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER YOUR DOPAMINE SYSTEM AND CERTAINLY THAT YOU HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR DOPAMINE SYSTEM SO THAT YOU CAN MODULATE AND ADJUST YOUR LEVELS OF DOPAMINE IN THE WAYS THAT SERVE YOU BEST IF YOU'RE LEARNING FROM AND OR ENJOYING THIS PODCAST

YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TO DAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS AND ERECEIVED A TON OF QUESTIONS ABOUT TRAMA ABOUT THERAPY ABOUT HOW TO ASESS WHERE ONE IS IN THEIR OWN ARK OF PROBLEMS AND ADDRESSING THEMILIAL ISSUES AND RELATIONSHIP ISSUES AND SO FORTH WE OU JUST START OFF VERY BASE IF YOU JUST GET EVERYONE ORIENTED HOW SHOULD WE DEFINE TROAMA WE ALL HAVE HARD EXPERIENCES SOME OF THEM WE MIGT RUMINATE ON MORE THAN OTHERS BUT WHAT IS TROM TO MAKE THE DEFINITION RELEVANT I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT TRAMA AS NOT O ANYTHING NEGATIVE THAT HAPPENS TO US BUT SOMETHING THAT OVERWHELMS OUR COPING SKILLS AND THEN LEAVES US DIFFERENT AS WE MOVE FORWARD SO IT CHANGES THE WAY THAT OUR BRAINS FUNCTION AND THEN THAT CHANGE IS EVIDENT IN US AS WE MOVE FORWARD THROUGH LIFE HOW DO WE KNOW IF WE HAVE TRAMA OR NOT I'VE HEARD BEFORE EVERYONE HAS TRAMA FRENCE AS I'VE HEARD THAT IF WE ARE A CHILD OR WHEN WE ARE A CHILD AND WE REQUEST LOVE FROM APPARENT OR ATTENTION FROM A PARENT IF THEY DISMISS US THAT THAT'S A MICHRO TRAMA IS THAT OVERSTATING OR UNFAIR TO THE REAL ISSUE OF TRAMA DO WE ALL HAVE TRAMA WHAT OR MICHERO TRAMAS WHAT OR MACK OR TRAMAS I THINK TRAMAIS THAT WE MIGHT CATEGORIZES DISAPPOINTMENT RIETER OR THINGS THAT ARE OUR NEGATIVE BUT NOT DEEPLY IMPACTFUL I THINK IS IS NOT IS NOT A HELPFUL DEFINITION  I THINK THE HELPFUL DEFINITION IS SOMETHING THAT RISES TO THE MNAGNITUDE OF REALLY CHANGING US AND SOMETHING THAT WE CAN SEE BOTH IN HOW WE BEHAVE WE CAN SEE IT IN MOOD ANXIETY BEHAVIOR SLEE PHYSICAL HEALTH SO WE SO WE CAN IDENTIFY IT AND WE CAN ALSO SEE IT IN BRAIN CHANGES SO THTHE SO FACT THAT WE BECOMES A MORE HYPER VIGILANT DRIHT MORE VIGILANT THAN WE CAN SEE THAT DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BRAIN OR MORE ACTIVE SO SO THAT DEFINITION THAT DEFINITION CAPTURES HOW TRMA IF IT RISES TO A CERTAIN LEVEL LIKE WHAT WE WOULD SAY TRAMA THAT MAKES A POST TRAMA CINDRA RIGHT LEAVES US DIFFERENT I THINK IS THE HELPFUL DEFINITION OF TRAMA BECAUSE IT'S A CLINICAL DEFINITION RIGHT IT'S CHANGES IN US AS PEOPLE AND WE CAN WE CAN MAP THOSE CHANGES TO IDENTIFIABLE SHIFTS IN OUR BRAIN FUNCTION HOW DO WE KNOW IF WE'VE BEEN CHANGED BY SOMETHING IM I CAN THINK BACK TO THILDHOOD EVENTS WHERE SOME KID ON THE PLAY GROUND OR IN THE CLASS ROM SAID SOMETHING I DIDN'T LIKE SOMETHING NEGATIVE ABOUT ME I THINK MOST PEOPLE CAN DO THAT WE HAVE A GREAT MEMORY FOR THE KID THAT SAID SOMETHING AWFUL OR THE PARENT OR TEACHER THAT SAID SOMETHING AWFUL THAT REALLY FELT LIKE IT HURT US OR AT LEAST IT STUCKED WITH US SO CLEARLY AONE'S BRAIN MY BRAIN IN THIS EXAMPLE HAS BEEN CHANGED BY THE THAT EVENT SUCH THAT I REMEMBER IT BUT HOW DO WE KNOW IF SOMETHING HAS ACTUALLY CHANGED THE WAY THAT WE ARE BECAUSE COURSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW WE WOULD BE OTHERWISE THAT'S THAT'S DIFFICULT IT IT'S DUABLE BUT IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE RESPONSE SO IF THE TRAMA RISES TO THE LEVEL OF CHANGING OUR BRAINS AND AND I DON'T DISME LIC WITH A NEW MEMORY RIGT SO WE CAN HAVE MEMORIES OF SOMETHING THAT WAS NEGATIVE IT AND IN THAT SENSE IT CHANGES THE BRAIN BECAUS NOW THERE SOMETHING WE CAN CALL TO MIND BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FUNCTIONING OF THE BRAIN IF IF T RAMA RISES TO THE LEVEL OF CHANGING THE FUNCTIONING OF OUR BRAINS THAND THERE IS ALMOST ALWAYS A REFLEX OF GUILT AND SHAME AROUND THE TRAMA THAT CAN LEAD US AND OFTEN LEADS US TO BERY RIHT TO AVOID IT RIGHT TO TO FEEL THAT NOW THERE'S SOMETHING NEGATIVE INSIDE OF ME AND IT'S FEELS SHAMEFUL OR IT FEELS NO ONE ELSE WOULD ACCEPTEDT ISO SO WHAT HAPPENS AS PEOPLE TEND TO AVOID LOOKING AT THE CHANGE IN THEM WHICH IS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE RIGT THE IDEA OF IN A VIRAL PANDAMIC REVERY WHEN I STAY AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER AND ISOLATE RIGHT BUT BUT WITH THE TRMA EPIDAMIC WE NEED WE NEED TO COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER PEOPLE WE NEED TO COMMUNICATE AND PUT WORDS TO WHAT'S GONE ON INSIDE OF US AND AND VERY OFTEN A PERSON KNOWS I MEAND I'VE DONE SO MUCH CLINICAL WORK OVER ABOUT TWENTY YEARS THAT THAT HAS FOCUSED ONTRAMA AND A LOT OF THE TIMES THE PERSON KNOWS RIGHT BUT THEY'RE NOT ADMITTING TO THEMSELVES BECAUSE HEY'RE AFRAID OF IT EY THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO BUT IF  THEY START TALKING THAND THE LITTLE TALK ABOUT THE EVENT OR THE SITUATION COULD BE SOMETHING ACUTE OR COULD BE SOMETHING CHRONIC THAT REALLY HAS BEEN HARMFUL TO THEM  AND THEN THEY FEEL DIFFERENT AFTERWARDS IK OH AFTER THAT I STARTED THINKING DIFFERENTLY FEELING DIFFERENTLY BUT THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN SOMETIMES IT'S A PROCESS OF EXPLORATION WENATHROUGH DIALOGUE WRIGHT WHETHE WHETHER IT'S WRITTEN OR WHETHER IT'S SPOKEN OF OF THE PERSON SO EXPLORING THE CHANGES INSIDE OF THEMSELVES MAY BE CHANGES TO THEIR SELF TALK INSIDE CHANGES TO THEIR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE WORLD AND WHETHER THEY CAN NAVIGATE SAFELY AND READILY IN IT AND YOU  ANCHERS S I TALK ABOUT THIS THE EXAMPLE ALL USE AT TIMES AS THE EXAMPLE OF MY OWN LIFE WHERE YOU KNOWIN I WAS MUCH YOUNGER IN MY EARLY TWENTIES MY YOUNGER BROTHER TOOK HIS LIFE BY SUICIDE AND THE YOR THE RESPONSE OF GUILT AND SHAME ND AND HIDING ALL OF IT INSIDE OF ME WAS WAS IT IS AS VERY DRAMATIC BUT BUT I WASN'T ACKNOWLEDGING IT RIGHT CAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT AND I FELT GUILTY AND I FELT RESPONSIBLE AND I FELT ASHAMED SO THERE WAS AN AVOIDANCE INSIDE OF ME AND THEN I WASN'T SAYING TO MYSELF A BEFORE THIS AK YOU THOUGHT THAT YOU COULD BE EFFECTIVE AND YOU COULD MAKE YOUR WAY IN THE WORLD AND YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE A GOOD PERSON AND YOU WORKED HARD YOU COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE RIGHT AND THEN AFTERWARDS I THOUGHT I CAN'T GET ANY WHERE THE R THE WORLDS AGAINST ME AND YOU KNOW  I FELT LIKE ALL MY MY OPTIONS ARE ALL GON AND  AS A TWENTY FOR YEARS OLD RIGHT SO IT SO I DIDN'T SEE THAT THE CHANGE WAS IN ME BUT I WAS TAKEN CARE OF MYSELF POORLY LIKE WHO IS ENOUGH GOING ON THAT WAS UNHEALTHY THAT I COULDN'T AVOID THE REALIZATION T LIKE I'M DIFFERENT NOW AND IN THESE WAYS THAT ARE AUTOMATIC YOU KNOW MY REFLEX TO CAN I MAKE MY WAY IN THE WORLD CAN I HAVE A GOOD LIFE CAN I BE HAPPY MY REFLEXES THAT WERE ALL DIFFERENC AND THEY WERE COMING THROUGH THE LENDS OF I AND ANXIETY HEIGHTENED VIGILANCE A SENSE OF GUILT A SENSE OF SHAME IAND A SENSE OF NONE BELONGING IN THE WORLD AND AND WAS ULTIMATELY GOOD AND HELPFUL PEOPLE AROUND ME UM AND MY OWN REALIZATION AND HA THINGS ARE NOT GOING WELL RIGHT THAT LED ME TO THEN GET SOME HELP AND TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT IT AND REALIZE LIKE OL MY GOTIC ANY TO FACE THESE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON INSIDE OF ME FROM A PSYCHOANALYTIC PSYCHOLOGICAL AND MAY BEVEN A NUR SCIENCE PERSPECTIVE TWO QUESTIONS WHY DO YOU THINK THAT WHEN WE EXPERIENCE TRAMA THESE THINGS THAT WE CALL GUILT AND SHAME SURFACE YOU KNOW EVERYTHNG YOU'RE TELLING ME IS THAT IN THE AND THAT'S NOT ADAPTIVE WHY WOULD WE BE BUILT THAT WAY UM SO THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS YU NOW HOW SHOULD WE CONCEPTINALIZE YOU ON GUILT AND SHAME YOU KNOW I THINK A WE HEAR GUILT WE HEAR SHAME UM YOU KNOW HOW SHAL WE THINK ABOUT IT I'MAN THAT THOSE EMOTIONS UM MUST EXIST IN US FOR SOME REASON U BUT IN THIS CASE IT SEEMS LIKE THEY THEY DON'T SERVE US WELL SO UM MAYBE IT IN THAT ORDER OR IN REVERSE ORDER YOUAND WHAT AT WHAT IS GUILT REALLY WHAT IS SHAME REALLY AND WHY IS IT THAT WE SEEM TO BE REFLECTIVELY WIRED TO FEEL GUILTY AND FEEL ASHAMED WHEN THAT'S EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN THE CASE OF TRAMA RIGHT RIGHTNI THINK THESE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS AND AND OW DON'T THINK ANYONE KNOWS THE ANSWERS FOR SURE BUT MY READ OF ALL THAT IS THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ADAPTIVE THAT IS HAPPENED IN US THROUGH EVOLUTION THAT NOW BECOMES MALADAPTIVE IN THE WAY WE LIVE IN THE MODERN WORLD RIGHT SO F YOU THINK OF THROUGHMOST OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AN PEOPLE WEREN'T LIVING THAT LONG RIGHT THE IDEA WAS TO SURVIVE AND REPRODUCE SO SO TRAMATIC THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO US IT WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR THEM TO STAY WITH US RIGHT SO YOU KNOW IF YOU ATE A NEW FOOD AND GOT REALLY REALLY SICK THAK YOU BETTER REMEMBER THAT RIGHT YOU KNOW IF YOU SEE SOME ONE FROM THE GROUP OF PEOPLE YOU KNOW A COUPLE MILES AWAY RIGHT AND ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE ATTACKS YOU RIGHTS AT YOU BETTER REMEMBER THAT SO SO THE TRAMATIC THINGS THAT OUR SOVE EMBLAZONED IN OUR BRAIN ARE BUILT TO LAST RIGHT THINGS THAT ARE POSITIVE WILL GENERATE SOME MOTION INSIDE OF US BUT THINGS THAT ARE PROFOUNDLY NEGATIVE ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO SAY WITH US AND I THINK THAT THAT WAS ADAPTIVE RIGHT WHEN ALL OF THAT WAS ABOUT SURVIVAL RIGHT AND I THINK THE SAME THING IS TRUE WITH WULD SAY SHAME RIGHT SO I THINK HERET MAKE SENSE THATTO TO TALK A LITTLE BEEN ACTIOM INTERESTED IF YOU YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS RIGHT THAT THAT THE LYMPIC SYSTEM RIGHT SO THAT THE SYSTEM OFTEN IS CALLED THE EMOTION SYSTEM RIGHT IN OUR IN OUR BRAINS HAS A OF COURSE VARYING FUNCTION RIGHT AND ONE ASPECT IS AFFECT RIGHT SO AFFECT IS AROUSED IN US W CH WHICH THIC THE THE MEANING THEN IS IT'S CREATED IN US WITHOUT OUR CHOICE RIGHT SO IF IF WE'RE WALKING DOWN THE ROAD AND SOME ONE JUMPS IN TRONT OF US OR PUSHES US RIGHT THAND THERE'S A RESPONSE OF FEAR OR ANGER RIGHT HEARTSTARTS BEATING FASTER YOU KNOW MORE BLOOD TO THE MUSCLES AND WE WE'RE GETTING READY TO TO FIGHT RIGHT OR OR RUN RIGHT IN THEN WE BECOME AWARE OF IT RIGHT SO SO THE AROUSED AFFECT IN US IS ALSO ABOUT SURVIVAL AND IT HAS A VERY DEEP IMPACT UPON US AND SHAME IS AN AROUSED AFFECT SO SO MAT IT IT CAN BE RAISED IN US WITHOUT OUR CHOICE AND IT'S VERY POWERFUL WHICH IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT IS AN EXTREMELY STRONG TOTURRENT RIGHT SO IF YOU HAD IN IMAGINE A A TRIBE R GROUP OF PEOPLE RIGHT THAT ARE SHELTERED TOGETHER AND IN A SOME ONE EAT'S HALF THE FOOD AT NIGHT SO THING RIGHT AND THAT THERE'S A VERY NEGATIVE RESPONSE RIGHT IN THAT PERSON FEELS SHAME HIS SHAME IS SO POWERFUL TO TO CONTROL BEHAVIOR RIGT SO THE WAY THAT TROMIC CAN CHANGE OUR BRAINS AND AND STAY WITH US IN WAY THIS AS BE MORE VIGILANT LOOK AT THE WORLD IN A DIFFERENT WAY ACT MORE DEFENSIVELY RIGHT AND AND HOW THAT LINKS TO SHAME AND TO GUILTS AND THIN GUILT IN IN BUT GUILT BECOMES WHAT GETS CALLED FEELING TECHNICALLY WHERE WE RELATE THE AROUSED AFECT TO OURSELVES RIGHT SO SO SHAME THE AROUSED AFFECT AND GUILT THE NEXT STEP RIGHT WHEN WE WHEN THE SHAME GETS RELATED TO SELF ARE SUCH PROFOUND BEHAVERAL INTERVENTIONS AND AND DETERRENCE RIGT THAT YOU CAN SEE I THINK HOW EVOLUTIONARILY AND OF ALL MAKE SENSE IF WERE FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL KNOWN WE'RE AN ELDER STATESMAN IF WE MAKE IT TO TWENTY RIGHT THIS MAKE SENSE BUT IT DOES IT MAKE SENSE IN A WORLD WHERE WE LIVE MUCH LONGER RIGHT WE NAVIGATE IN ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND THERE'S SO MUCH COMING AT US THAT CAN BE TROMATIZING WE YOU THINK ABOUT THE NEWS AND ME HOW MANY TIMES OF IGHT WRITTEN A PRESCRIPTION FOR SOME ONE IS AYS KNO MORE NEWS RIGHT WE E AFTE WRITTEN THEOR YES ERE YES WERE SO GLANCE AT THE NEWS LIKE LOOK AT THE NEWS FOR NEWS AN THING GOING ON I NEED TO KNOW RIGHT BUT BUT WHAT ARE PEOPLE DOING IS LOOKING AT IT THEIR CLOOCKING IN THEIR CLOKING ENTERS AN THERE'S A SENSE OF BEING INTHRALLED IN A VERY FRIGHTENING WAY WITH THE HORRORS THAT ARE IN FRONT OF US AND AND IT SHOWS OUT YES TROMIC AND COME THROUGH ACUTE THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO US TROMIC CAN COME THROUGH CHRONIC THINGS CHRONIC DENEGRATION WHETHER IT'S BASED UPON SOCIO ECONOMIC STAT IS IMMIGRANT EMIGRATIONS TATUS OM A RACE RELIGION SECUALITY GENDER IDENTITY THAT THE THESE CHRONIC TROMAS RIGHT OF BEING DENEGRATED BY THE SOCIETY ROUND US RETREATED AS LESS THAN CAN CHANGE THE BRAIN BUT VICARRIOUS EXPERIENCE IS CAN TOO RIGHT AND WE KNOW THIS IS NOT THEORETICAL WE KNOW THAT THE CHANGES IN THE BRAIN CAN COME FROM VICAR IOUS EXPERIENCES TOO WHICH IS WHY PEOPLE WERE GLUED TO THE NEWS THAN FEELING LIKE ALL MY GOODNESS I WHAT IS HAPPENING OF THA THE MOTHERS IN THE UCRANE WHO IN A LOST BABIES IN THE WARN LIKE THEIR THINGS THAT ARE SO TERRIFYING THAT IF WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME WITH THAT IT HAS A SIMILAR EFFECTS SO OURE BRAINS ARE BUILT TO CHANGE FROM TRAMA BUT NOT IN THE WAY WE EXPERIENCED TRAMA AND NOT IN THE WAY THAT WE LIVE LIFE IN TERMS OF THE NATURE OF LIVING LIFE IN THE DURATION OF LIFE IN THE MODERN WORLD WITH THESE DRAMAS THAT HAPPENED TO US ARE OFTEN SO BAD FOR US BECAUSE THEY THEY CHANGE HOW OUR BRAIN IS SUNCTIONING AND THEN ARE ENTIRE ORANT ORIENTATION TILL THE WORLD IS DIFFERENT AND THAT COULD BE FOR IU YEARS AND YEARS AND DECADES AND DECADES IT BRINGS SO MUCH MISERY AND SUFFERING AND AT TIMES IT BRINGS DEATH F FEETING BUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND OVERDOSES DEATHS IN THIS COUNTRY IN A YEAR A HUNDRED THOUSAND WHERE IS A IS SO MUCH OF THAT ARISING FROMS AT PERSON WHOSE TREATED ADDICTION VERY INTENSIVELY OVER MANY YEARS I THINK THE WHIL I FEEL SURE THAT THE MAJORITY OF ADICTION THAT I SEE AND TREAT O RISE IS ULTIMATELY THE ROOTS OF IT ARE IN TRAMA AND ARE IN TRYING TO SOOTHE SOMETHING THAT STUCK INSIDE THAT THE PRISON IS T LETTING OUTSIDE BECAUSE OF THE GUILT AN SHAME BUT IS RUNNING ROUND IN THEIR HEAD AND TORMENTED BY IT AND AND NOW THERE'S A POLE FOR FOR THESE DRUGS ARE SOMETHINGES MEDICINES TO SOOTHE SO THEY OR THE THE OL OPIATS THAT WERE GIVEN AFTER A MINOR SURGERY RIGHT AR AR T OCAE YET THEY HELP THE PAIN FOR THE MINOR SURGERY BUT WHAT THE REALLY HELPING IS THE PAIN INSIDE RIGHT BUT THAT VERY QUICKLY TURNS INTO ADDICTION DANGER RISK WHEN WE SEE THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND AND  NOT IN NOT IN A THEORETICAL WAY LIKE I SEE THAT IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN MY PRACTICE WITH ADDICTION THEARISING FROM TRAMA WHO HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY DIED SO IT SOIT HAVE RIT LARGE IN OUR EXISTENCE IN THE MODERN WORLD INCREDIBLE TO ME THAT THIS IS THE WAY WORKS A AND WHAT WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THIS IDEA THAT I'VE HEARD ABOUT BEFORE I THINK IT WAS A FROIDIAN CONCEPT UP A REPETITION COMPULSIONOUS THAT AM YOU KNOW THIS THIS IS WHAT BOGGLES MY MIND AS I'M HEARING THIS SOMETHING HAPPENS TO US OR WE OBSERVE SOMETHING TRAMATIC AND INSTEAD OF ACKNOWLEDGING THAT AND TRYING TO DISTANCE FROM IT THERE SEEMS TO BE A REFLECT OF CHAME AN GILT IN MANY CASES AND STUFFING IT AWAY AND THEN A REPETITION OF BEHAVIOURS TO CONTINUE TO TRY AND TO STUFF IT AWAY AT'S O TRYING TO PACK I DON'T KNOW RECENTLY I WAS PACKING A HOME AND TRYING TO GET THAA SLEEPING BAG BACK INTO THE BAG ITS IT SIPLY HAVE ALWAYS ON A MUSHRMOUNT THE TOP THIS KIND OF THING IT TAKES A LOT OF ON GOING EFFORT AND AT THE SAME TIME THAT IF THIS THING REALLY EXISTS THIS REPETITION COMPULSION PEOPLE WILL RETURN OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO THE KINDS OF SONARIOS OR AT LEAST THE KINDS OF EMOTIONAL STATES THAT LOOK JUST LIKE THE TRAMA ER RESEMBLE IT IN SOME WAY SO THE THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU IS IS THE REPETITION COMPULSION A REAL THING AND WHY WULD WE BE WIRED THAT WAY MY UNDERSTANDING OF THIS CONCEPT OF THE REPETITION COMPULSION IS THAT WE ALL WANT TO SOLVE OUR TRAMAS AND IT ALLOWS US TO PUT OURSELVES INTO MICRO OR UM AGAIN MACKR VERSIONS OF THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN WE GET TO RUN THE EXPERIMENT AGAIN AND AGAIN IN I TTEMPT TO SOLVE IT RIGHT IN THE CASE OF TAKING A DRUG THAT IT'S CLEARER  A CERTAIN DRUGS LIKE OPYODS ITS CLEAR HOW THAT WOULD NOT ALLOW US TO DEAL WITH IT RIGHT IT'S JUST MASKING IT AT THE EMOTIONAL STATE BUT WHY IS IT FOR INSTANCE THAT SOMEBODY WHO EXPERIENCES SECUAL TRAMA THEN PLACES THEMSELVES IN TO CIRCUMSTANCES OF MORE SEXUAL TRAMA WHYIS IT IS SOMEBODY WHO IS IN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP GOES ON TO HAVE A SECOND AND THIRD OR YEWORTH VERBALLY OR PHYSICALLY ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP THAT MEAN ON THE FACE OF YUTISCOPE THAT MAKES NO SENSE AND YET WE SEE THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN YES THE FIRST THING I OID SAY THAT THE THE VALIDITY OF THE REPETITION COMPULSION CAUGT CONCEPT Y IS IS A STRONG YES YET YES WE SEE THAT OVER AND OVER ITS NOT NECESSARILY IN EVERY ONE BA BOY IT IS IN A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED TRAMA AND AND I THINK THERE'S A VERY GOOD REASON ON THE FACE ON THE SURFACE OF IT IS THAY IT MAKES NO SENSE BUT THEN IF WE THINK HOW DOES THE BHOW DOES OUR BRAINS ACTUALLY FUNCTION RIGHT WE WE'RE SO IT TRAINED AT LEAST IN WESTERN SOCIETY I THINK TO THINK OF OURSELVES AS LOGICAL CREATURES RIGHT THAT LIKE OH WE'RE LOGICAL AND ULTIMATELY EVERYTHING IN US CAN JUST BOILED DOWN TO LOGIC AND IF WE THINK ABOUT IT ENOUGH WEE CAN WE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS WE JUST COMPLETELY NOT TRUE RIGHT THAT TH THE LYMBIC SYSTEM WRIT THE EMOTION SYSTEM SO TO SPEAK INSIDE OF US ALWAYS TRUMPS LOGIC RIGHT YEU THINK ABOUT DOES IT EVER MAKE SENSE TO RUN INTO A BURNING BUILDING MEAN LOGIC SAYS NOW RIGHT BUT IF SOME ONE YOU LOVE IS IN THE BURNING BUILDING YOU PEOPLE RUN RIGHT IN RIGHT BECAUSE THE LYMBI SYSTEM SAYS YES SO WHEN LOGIC AND EMOTION COME HEAD TO HEAD EMOTION WINS ALL THE TIME IF EMOTION IS POWERFUL ENOUGH IT WILL ALWAYS WIN AND SO THE LYMBIC SYSTEM IS SO IMPORTANT AND THE LYMBIC SYSTEM DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THE CLOCK OR THE CALENDAR RIGHT AND THAT'S THE ANSWER AND ALSO SO SAY WHY T TO THE REPETITION COMPULSIONS O THE LYMBIC SYSTEM DOES IT KNOW LIKE OH IT'S NOW IT'S TO DAY IT'S MAY IT'S TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TOJUST DOESN'T CARE AT ALL RIGHT SO SO HOW I WOULD RELATE THAT TO THE REPETITION COMPULSION IS IS WHTWHEN PEOPLE ARE REPEATING WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT RIGHT WITH THE IDEA THAT IF WE CAN REPEAT THE SITUATION AND MAKE IT RIGHT IT WILL FIX EVERYTHING RIGHT WHICH MAKES PERFECT SENSE IF IF WE THINK W LL WHERE IS THAT CONCEPT COMING FROM RIGHT IT'S COMING FROM THE EMOTIONAL PART OF THE BRAIN THAT WANTS RELIEF FROM SUFFERING OF THE TRAMA AND DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE CLOCK OR THE CALENDER SO IF I CAN SOLVE SOMETHING NOW I WILL ALSO SOLVE SOMETHING IN THE PAST RIGHT WHICH IS WHY I CAN'T TEE A HELL MANY TIMES THAT SAT WITH SOMEONE ES IT WERE STARTING TO DO THERAPY AN A PERSON WILL SAY GRASHAK I I KNOW  OOK YOU JUST CAN'T HELP ME RAM IN YOU MY LAST SEVEN RELATIONSHIPS HAVE BEEN ABUSIVE RIGHT AND I'LL SAY BACK SOMETHING SOMETIMES LIKE WELL OOK IF IF YOU TELL ME THAT YOU'VE AT SEVEN RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAVE BEEN ABUSIVE AND DIFFERENT WAYS I'LL AGREE WITH YOU I ONLY SAY THAT CAUSE THAT'S NEVER WHAT SOMEONE SAYS RIGHT BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME IS YOU'VE CONN HAD THE SAME RELATIONSHIP SEVEN TIMES S NOT SEVEN THINGS IT'S ONE RIGHT AND THAT'S ALWAYS I DON'T THINK ONE TIME YET IT IS THAT IS FAILED TO BE THE CASE AND THAT'S HOW TO THINK ABOUT IT THAT'S HOW WE START TO ELUSIDAT WHAT'S GOING ON SO THEY MIT THE LIKEBALL THAT GOES OFF LIKE I HAVE NOT HAD SEVEN DIFFERENT ABUS IVE RELATIONSHIPS I HAVE HAD ONE THAT I'VE REPEATED SEVEN TIMES AND NOW WE STARK GETTING TO WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON TO WAT NEED'S TO HAPPEN THAT PERSON NEEDS TO FACE WHAT HAPPEND IN THAT ORIGINAL ABUS IVE RELATIONSHIP AND IT ALWAYS COMES DOWN TO THE SAME SURCONCEPTS OF OF THE PERSON FEELING TERRIFIED WHILE THE ABUSE WAS GOING ON FEELING GUILTY FEELING ASHAMED FEELING LIKE OUG THEY BROUGHT IT ON THEMSELVES THEY DESERVE IT THEY DON'T DESERVE ANYTHING BETTER RIGHT BECAUSE THE BRAIN IS TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF IT RIGHT OR I I THOUGHT I COULD MAKE THAT OKE BUT I COULDN'T RIGHT AND THEN THERE'S MORE GUILT AND MORE SHAME AND IF THATS STUCK INSIDE OF SOMEONE NIG THAT'S BUNDLED UP IN SIDE OF SOME ONE OU KNOW LIKE A MEDICAL ABSESS INSIDE A PERSON YOU KNOW IT WOLD OFF INFECTION INSIDE THE BODY THIS IS THE SAME CONCEPT IN THE BRAIN THEN OF COURSE THE LIMIC SYSTEM IS GOINGO ON A FIX THAT AND AND IT FIXES IT BY TRYING TO LET'S RECREATE THAT SITUATION AND MAKE IT RIGHT THIS TIME AND THAT'S A MINUTES I THINK THAT ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES OF HOW THE RIGHT APPROACH OF IW LIKE LET'S LOOK AT THAT LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT RIGHT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON THERE WAIT WHO SHOULD FEEL GUILTY AND ASHAMED OF THE PERSON WHO WAS ABUSED OF THE PERSON WHO AS ABUSING RIGHT AND AND WE CAN GET AT WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE THE PERSON THAT'S WHAT CHANGES THAT ND THEN THE AIGTH RELATIONSHIP CAN BE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THAN THE FIRST SEVEN RIGT AND I SEE THAT ALL THE TIME AND IN THIS ISN'T ESO TERIC OR SOFT LIKE I SEE THAT PLAY OUT CLINICALLY OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND WHY TO THINGS GET BETTER BECAUSE WE GO TO THE TRAMA AND WE UNLOCK IT IT'S NOT HIDDEN INSIDE WERE CON CONTROL THINGS RIGHT WE BRING IT TO THE SURFACE AND THEN WWE CAN TAKE AWAY IT'S POWER I KEEP HEARING IN THE NARRATIVE THAT SO MUCH OF OUR REFLECTIVE RESPONSE TO TRAMA WITH EMOTIONAL AND RETHE REPETITION COMPULSION AND TREMS OF BEHAVIOURS IS ABOUT SOME VERY DEEP ATTEMPT TO CHANGE THE PAST YES AND IN FACTION IN AWFULINE CONVERSATION I I RECALL A YOU SAYI SOMETHING ABOUT THIS THAT YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF BEHAVIOURS AND THOUGHTS AND AVOIDANCE OF BEHAVIORS AND AVOIDANCE OF THOUGHTS THAT HUMAN BEINGS PUT INTO TRY AND CHANGE O THE PAST ISE IS REMARKABLE AND EARY AND MALADAPT IF IT'S ITIS ELSELIKE YES AND THAT REALLY STUCK WITH ME BECAUS I THINK WE ALL WANT TO FEEL LIKE WE'RE IN CONTROL OF OUR FUTURE AND HOW WE FEEL IN THE MOMENT AND TO SOME EXTEND IT IT WORKS FOR A BRIEF WHILE YOU KNOW THERE'S THI THING THAT HAPPENED AND IT JUST I EVOKES SOME INTERNAL AROUSAL AND THEN YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT AROUSAL AND I THINK OF FOR MANY PEOPLE AND CLEAN MYSELF THERE'S THES THIS FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OQUET THAT THE THOUGHT ABOUT THE THING THE EVENT OR EVENTS PLURABL EVOKES IS AROUSAL THIS INTERNAL STATES MAKE SOME PEOPLE FEEL SLEEPY AND EXHAUSTED OTHER PEOPLE FEEL REALLY ANXIOUS OTHER PEOPLE FEEL ANGRY I MEAN THAT TEROUSAL HAS ALL THESE DIFFENT DIMENTIONS IS AS AYOU KNOW AND THEN THERE'S DISCRUSTION BUT WHAT TO DO WITH IT AND AND I'D LOVE TO HEAR A THEYE EVEN JUST A A TOP CONTOUR PRESCRIPTIVE OF WHAT OWHAT DOES ONE DO I'LL EVEN JUST PUT MYSELF IN WHAT DO I DO HIVE SIM FEELING UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING SHOULD I FEEL LIKE MY OPTIONS ARE HEALTHY CATHARSIS I CAN TELL THE STORY FEEL IT I COULD UM I CAN PACK IT DOWN A WE HEAR THAT IT'S BAD TO PACK IT DOWN BUT OF COURSE ONE HAS TO BE FUNCTIONAL IN LIFE OM AND DEAL WITH THINGS AND WEAVE RESPONSIBILITIES A WORK IN RELATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES ET CETERA WE NEED TA SLEEP AT NIGHT SO CATHARC IS HEALTHY CATHARCIS PACKING IT DOWN AT THE OTHER EXTREME UM TELLING THE STORY AND YET I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO TELL THE STORY BECAUSE IT'S ON IN THAT TELLING THERE'S A PERHAPS A RE EMERGENCE OF THE AROUSAL THE ROUSAL CAN BECOME GREATER I ME GE IT IS THAT WHAT PEOPLE MEAN WHEN THEY SAY THINGS ARE GOIG TO GET WORSE BEFORE THEY GET BETTER I M SO I GUESS THE SIMPLE VERSION OF THIS LONG WINDED QUESTION IS IT'S CLEAR WE NEED TO CONFRONT THESE THINGS WE CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST BY A REFLECTIVE RESPONSE ISN'T GOING TO DO THAT EFFICIENTLY AND SO HOW DO WE DEAL WITH AROUSAL HOW DOES ONE TAKE WHAT THEY FEEL INSIDE ABOUT SOMETHING SHAMEFUL WHAT HE DO WITH IT IN A MOMENT AND DOES THAT HAVE TO BE DONE IN THE PRESENCE OF A SKILLED TRAINE THERAPIST OR AS AM DRIVING TO WORK IN THE MORNING AND SOMETHING COMES UP I CAN'T DEEL WITH THIS RIGHT NOW COMES TO MIND WHAT DO I DO DO I DEAL WITH IT RIGHT THEN I KNOW THICE IS A BIG RAALTY TO MENTIONAL QUESTION BUT I THINK IT'S THE ONE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE GRAPPLE WITH WE WANT TO DEAL WITH THINGS HOW DO WE DEAEL WITH THAT INTERNAL AROUSAL YEYEWE SO OFTEN TRY AND CHANGE THE TRAMA OF THE PAST IN ORDER TO CONTROL THE FUTURE AND WHAT WHAT THAT REALLY ADDS UP TO IS THE TRAMA OF THE PAST DOMINATES OUR PRESENT RIGHT AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY IN REMEMBER WHETE TALKING ABOUT TRAMAS THAT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF CHANGING THE BRAIN SO AS YOU'RE SAYING THAT INVOLVES RE EXPERIENCE IT INVOLVES HYPER VIGILANCE INCREASED AROUSAL IT CHANGES IN MOOD STATES CHANGES IN ANXIETY CHANGES IN SLEEP CHANGES IN BEHAVIOUR SO SO THESE ARE ALL CHANGES THAT IT ISN'T PUSH TOWARDS DOMINATING OUR PRESENT RIGHT AND AND THEN WE'RE NOT REALLY LIVING IN THE PRESENT RIGHT AS WE'RE TRYING TO CONTROL THE FUTUREWHER I CAN DO A GREAT JOB OF CONTROLLING OUR FUTURE IF WE'RE NOT REALLY LIVING IN THE PRESENT RIGHT AND TESO THE WAY TO COME AT THAT EGAND IN THE MOMENT IF YOU SAINT OK THE MOMENT IF I NEED TO FALL ASLEEP RIGHT I MIGHT SELK GET LET ME TR AND PUT THAT OUT OF MY MIND LET ME TRY AND THOUGHT REDIRECT SO SO THERE'S SHORT TERM STRATEGIES THAT CAN LET US BE FUNCTIONAL IN THE CONTECTS OF THESE CHANGES BUT THE ANSWER IS TO GO LOOK DIRECTLY AT THAT THING RIGHT ELOOK AT THAT TRAMA EXPLORE THAT TRAMA AND SURE THAT CAN BE DONE WITH A PROFESSIONAL AND SOMETIMES THAT'S WHAT MAKES SENSE BUT NOT ALWAYS RIGHT SOMETIMES IT CAN BE DONE BY TALKING TO ANOTHER PERSON RIGHT WRITING IT DOWN RIGHT LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF ME THAT MY MIND IS SO STUCK TO THIS LET'S EXPLORE THAT BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST AS IF WE'RE WE'RE SO AFRAID SO OFTEN OF LOOKING AT THE TRAMA THAT HAS CHANGED US THAT WE'LL LOOK ANYWHERE BUT AT THAT RIGHT IS LET IU'S LIKE IT'S CHIDDEN IN A CLOSET AND WE'LL SHINE LIGHT EVERYWHERE ELSE WHE WERE KNOCKIN O OPEN THAT DOOR AND THAT'S WHERE WOU'RE PEOPLE WILL SAY THAT SAME AS EVE HEARD OVER AND OVER AND I MYSELF HAVE THOUGHT THIS AT TIMES IKE IF IS TALK ABOUT THAT ON THEN T STAR CRYING AND NEVER STOP RIGHT OR I'GIN TO JUST FALL APART RIGHT WHICH IS NEVER WHAT HIVAS NO ONE EVER STARPS CRYING AND NEVER STOPS RIGHT WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS WHEN THE PERSON PUTS WORDS TO IT RIGHT I COULD BE IN WRITING CO BE TALKING TO A TRUSTED OTHER OR WITH E THERAPIST RIGT THINGS START TO CHANGE MEAN JUST THE FACT THAT YOU CAN TALK ABOUT IT YOU CAN PUT WORD TO IT AND OTHER PEOPLE DON'T RECOIL RIGHT MEAN HOW MANY TIMES IS SOME ONE SAID SOMETHING FOR THE FIRST TIME RIGHT AND AND WHEN THERE TELLING ME ABOUT THE TRAMA TH THERE THERE'S SUCH AN ANXIOUS LIKE LOOKNG LIKE AS IF IM CAN BE WRONGN TO RECOIL FROM IT RIGHT MEANING I'M GOING TO RECOIL FROM THEM RIGHT IN THEN THERE'S A SENSE OF SURPRISE IF THE PERSON SAYS WELL AND I WAS ABUSED BY  THIS COACHWHEN I WAS AKID RIGTERS AND AND THERE'S NOT O KITHERS THERE'S NOT A RESPONSE OF RECOILING YOU CAN SEE THE CHANGE AND PEOPLE WILL SAY A LOT LIKE WELL IT  I'M I CAN'T BELIEVE LIKE YOU CAN LIKE HEAR ME SAY THAT O BOU O CAME WITH IT RIGHT I MEANS YOU THINK BUT WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE F THEM LIKE GET HOWM WHAT A A SENSE OF SHAME A SENSE OF YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING AWFUL ABOUT ME FOR PEOPLE TO RECOIL FROM AND IT'S JUST NOT TRUE BUT BUT THER HERES WERE TROMA IS IT'S INSIDIOUS RIGHT AND IT'S PERVASIVE RIGHT BECAUSE IF THAT CONVINCES US TO CONTINUALLY HIDE IT AWAY THEN HOW DO WE EXPLORE IT LIKE THAT YOU KNOW THAT EXAMPLE OF OF THE PERSON I IS LOOK I WAS ABUSED BY A COACH WHEN I WAS A CHILD ME I'M THINKING OF IT OF A COUPLE VERY REAL CASES RIGTABIT PEOPLE THAT I'VE TAKEN CARE OF AND ONCE THEY START TALKING ABOUT IT THEN THEY START TALKING ABOUT HOW AN THEY WERE JUST INNOCENT KIDS RIGHT AND LIKE THEY DIDN KNOW AND LIKE THEY REALLY WANT TO BE ON THE TEAM WHERE THIS COACH WAS TREATING THEM AS SPECIAL AND AND NOW THEY CAN LOOK AT THEMSELVES FROM THE OUTSIDE RIGHT THEY CAN LOOK AT THEMSELVES LIKE THEY WOULD LOOK AT SOME ONE ELSE RIGHT YOU THINK IT'S SO EASY FOR US TO SEE WHAT S TO REAL AND TRUE IF IT'S SOME ONE ELSE AND IF YOU ASK LONELY WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF SOMEONE WHOS TEN ELEVEN YEARS OLD WHOSE ABUSED AND MANIPULATED IND ABUSE BY AN ADOPIS ALL MY GOODNESS I FEEL COMPASSION FOR THAT PERSON RIGHT BUT IF IT'S US RIGHT THEN ONA IT'S GUILT AND SHAME WE HAVE TO HIDE IT AWAY AND WHEN THE PERSON STARTS LOOKING AT IT TIT CAN SO TO SEE IT FROM THE OUTSIDE AND IT STARTS TO TAKE THE ENERGY OUT OF IT RIGHT THEN WHAT WHO SHOULD FEEL GUILTY ABOUT THAT WHO'S DONE SOMETHING WRONG AND LIT SO NOW THE CONCEPTIONS COME TOGETHER WHICH IS OFTEN A REFLECTSIVE THAT WAS MY FAULT OH I I DID IT I I WENT BACK TO IT IKE I I STILL STAYED ON THE TEAM I WENT BACK NEXT SEASON RIGHT I LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN BAT ALL THE GUILT AND SHAME INSIDE THE PERSON GETS JUCKS TOPPOSES LIKE WHAT REALLY HAPPEN THERE AND THEN THEY SET RIGHT I WAS A TERRIFIED CHILD RIGHT AND UNDERSTAND AT ALL AND THEY CAN COME TO A PLACE OF COMPASSION AND NOW WE ARE WORKING AGAINST THE GUILT AND SHAME AND IF THE PERSON CRIES ABOUT IT THET'S GREAT RITI ME CRYING IS ONE OF THE BEST COPING MECHANISMS WE HAVE IT DOESN'T HURT US AND IT LETS US GREVE THINGS YET WE CAN'T GRIEVE IF THERE'S GUIL AND SHAME INSIDE WAS IT JUST BLOCKS GRIEF RIGHT WE HAVE TO TIT HAS TO BE A CLEAN SLATE IN A SENSE IN ORDER TO FEEL SADNESS AND THEN YOU SEE THAT IT SHIFTS FROM AANXIETY ANGER AND FRUSTRATION USUALLY DIRECTED TOWARDS ITSELF GUILT AND SHAME TOORDS A TOWARDS BEING ABLE TO PROCESS IT AND BEING ABLE TO BRING TO BEAR SOME COMPASSION AND BEING ABLE TO DIRECT THE NEGATIVE EMOTION SO TO SPEAK WHERE THE'RE WARRANTED AND MY GOODNESS THE SHANGES THAT HAPPEN MES NOWLING AS PEOPLE ARE MIRACULOUSLY CURED RIGHT BUT IT'S REMARKABLE HOW JUST GETTING IT OUT THERE AND HAVE LIKE ONE HOUR OF TALKING LIKE THAT LIKE LIKE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW CAN CAN LEAVE A PERSON FEELING IMMENSELY BETTER IT SEEMS TO ME IN HEARING THIS TAT THERE'S THIS WERD WIRING WE HAVE BECAUSE WHAT I'M HEARING IS WHEN TROMAS HAPPENED TO US ARE WE OBSERVE THEM WHAT WE NEED TO DO MOST IS TO CONFRONT THOSE AND THE EMOTIONS AROUND THAT DIRECTLY YES BUT INSTEAD OUR SYSTEM DEFAULTS TO GUILT SHAME YES AND TRY TO HIDE IT YES AND THIS REP ETITION COMPULSION OF PLACING US BACK IN TO THINGS SIMILAR TO THOSE TRAMAS OR EVEN MAY BE EVEN WORSE TRAMAS YE IN AN ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE IT IT'S LIKE THE MOST MALADAPTIVE YES WIRING DIAGRAM I COULD POSSIBLY THINK OF EMOTIONAL AND PRESEMTLY PHYSIOLOGICAL WIRING DIAGRAM YES AND THIS NOTION OF TRYING TO CHANGE THE PASS BY DOING THINGS NOW WHEN THE EXACT OPPOSITE IS WHAT'S GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL LSOES SEEMS LIKE YET COMPLETE THE WHOLE SYSTEM SEEMS COMPLETELY BACKWARDS AND IM I'M CHUCKLING AS I SAID IT'S NOT BECAUSE I'M AMUSE IS BECAUSE I'M JUST BAFFLED ONCE AGAIN AT HOW OUR WIRING CAN OFTEN NOT SERVE US WELL BUT IT RAISES IT WHAT I THINK IS IT I IMPORTANT AN INTERESTING QUESTION WHICH IS EALLIER YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW YOUR PEOPLE WILL SEEK OUT MEDIA THAT'S REALLY DISTURBING THEY'LL TRAMATIZE AND RETRAMATIZE THEMSELVES ON THE DAILY BASIS SO THAT COULD BE VIEWED AS THE REPETITION COMPULSION OR THE PERSON WILL HAVE THE SAME RELATIONSHIP WITH SEVEN DIFFERENT TIS A ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH SEVERN DIFFERENT PARTNERS IN SEQUENCE SEEMS TERRIBLE AND YET AS I SAY THIS IT ALSO IS BECOMING CLEAR TO ME HOW THIS ALMOST SEEMS LIKE A A A POOR BUT DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE IT YES SOME WAY AND SO THE THE POORK IN THE ROAD IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY IS TO REALLY GET TO THE SEED INCIDENT REALLY GET TO THE THING THAT STARTIT IT ALL AS OPPOSED TO REPEATING IT ALL YES DOES THAT HAVE TO BE DONE IN THE PRESENCE OF A THERAPIST IS IS THERE BENEFIT TO TAKING A WALK AND THINKING ABOUT THESE THINGS BREAKING DOWN AND CRYING IF THAT'S WHAT'S NECESSARY OR FEELING ANGRY IF THAT'S WHAT COMES UP THE THE REASON I ASK IT THIS WAY IS BECAUSE I WORRY I'LL JUST SPEAK TO MY OF MY OWN EXPERIENCE I WORRY THAT IN REACTIVATING OR RTOUCHING INTO THE EMOTIONS AROUND SOMETHING THAT THAT IS ITSELF A FORM OF THE REPETITION COMPULSION BECAUSE YOU'RE FEELING IT ALL OVER AGAIN IT JUSTN YOU'RE NOT SEEKING OUT SOMETHING TO EVOKE THAT FEELING SO I REALIZE THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF A CIRCULAR ARGUMENT AM ET WARD ER QUESTION BUT I THINK IT'S ONE THAT I REALLY STRUGGLE WITH AND TRYING TO PARSE ALL THE THE I WHAT I THAT THAT THE OUTCOME BASE THERAPEES THAT I HEARABOUT AND I'M AND THE THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT PEOPLE MAKE I MEAN HOW SHOULD WE CONCEPTIONALIZES SOMETHING HAPPENS SOUNDS LIC WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THAT THING DIRECTLY DO WE NEED TO DO THAT WITH SOMEBODY ELSE CAN WE DO THAT ON OUR OWN IF WE'RE WE DON'T HAVE RESOURCES AND WE HAVE TO DO IT ON OUR OWN CAN'T HIRE SOMEONE CAN'T PAY SOMEONE TO WORK WITH US HOW DO WE DO THAT IN A WAY THAT ISN'T RETRAMATIZING OURSELF IN A MAJOR WAY OR IN A MINOR WAY IT HOW HOW DO WE KNOW WHERE WE ARE IN THAT LANDSCAPE AGEN THERE'S ITHINK'S GREAT QUESTIONS AND AN ITHING IT STARTS WITH REAL INTROSPECTION YOU KNOW WHEN THINGS ARE BOUND SING AROUND IN OUR MINDS OFTEN IT'S VERY NON PRODUCTIVE RIGHT IT'S THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIND AND THAT'S NOT HELPFUL FOR US RIGHT SO THERE'S AN IDEA WHICH SOMETIMES GETS CALLED AND OBSERVING EGO RGHT THE DEBILITY TO STOP AND LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF OURSELVES AND IT SO IF WE'RE JUST THINKING ABOUT IT AND WE'RE THINKING IN THE SAME WAY WE SOOD OFE AND I SENT ALWAYS THINK ABOUT IT THEN ALL WERE DOING IS REINFORCING THE TRAMA RIGHT BUT IF WE CIN DISTANCE ENOUGH TO BE LIKE HOM IT'S I'M INTERESTED IN WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF ME RIGHT THE CAN THINK OF A CERTAIN PERSON WHO NW WHO REALLY LOVES MUSIC AND AND IT'S SOME POINT IN OUR THERAPY WORK I LEARND LIKE SHEWAS TAKING LONG DRIVES BUT THE THE RADIO WASN'T ON NDIS  WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT AND I ASKED AND WHAT WAS GOING ON IF SHE WAS RUNNING OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN HER HEAD LIKE I'M A LOSER I'M A LOSER RIGHT AND SHE DIDN'T WANT THE MUSIC ON BECAUSE'S THE MUSIC WULD DROWN OUT WHAT SHE FELT SHE HAD TO SAY TO HERSELF RIGHT AND IT WAS THAT LIKE WOW THAT'S INTERESTING RIGHT AND THEN HER ABILITY TO OBSERVE THAT AND TO THINK WHY AM I DOING THAT WHEN IT COMES INTO HER MINDLIC WHAT IS THAT TRACE TO WHEN DID I START DOING THAT LOOK US IT IM I'M SAYING IT FOR POENT OF EXAGGERATION LIK NOBODY COMES OUT OF THE WOMB NO PROGRAMME TO THINK I'M A LOSER RIGHT SO WE DON'T WE DON'T THINK THAT WHEN WE'RE BORN OR SO WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM THEN WE CAN THINK IN WAYS THAT ALLOW US TO HAVE NEW THOUGHTS RIGHT THAT WE WEREN'T HAVING'S NOT JUST BOUNCING ROUND IN OUR MINDS AND IF WE SPEAK OR RIGHT THERE EVEN MORE MECHANISMS THAT COME ON LINE IN OUR BRAINS RIGHT THAT THAT ARE THEN ST OF MAUNDERING MECHANISM WE THINK IN A DIFFERENT WAY IF WERE USING WORDS RIGHT AND WE WE AR BETTER ABLE OFTEN TO BRING IN THAT OBSERVING EGL LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF ME SO SO IT CAN BE VERY HELPFUL TO THINK IT CAN BE HELPFUL TO TALK TO SOME ONE TO A TRUSTED OTHER NO FRIEND FAMILY CLERGY I TO WRIGT MEAN THESE OR THINGS IT CAN BE DONE WITHOUT EXPENDING ANY RESOURCES RIGHT AND AND SOMETIMES IT CAN MAKE REALLY A BIG DIFFERENCE RIGHT WAS A WAIT WHEN DID I START THINKING THAT AND THAT IN INTERESTINGLY IN THIS CASE LOKAN WE DID IT IN THERAPY BUT WE BECAME VERY CLEAR WHAT THAT WAS ROOTED TO RIGHT AND THEN IN THE THE THERAPY WHICH WAS STILL RELATIVELY YOUNG BUT WE'D DONE I SEVERAL SESSIONS AND WE WE WEREN'T TALKING AT ALL ABOUT WHAT WE NEEDED TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT BUT THAT'S WHAT GOT US TO WHAT WE NEEDED TO TALK ABOUT AND WHEN DID THAT START AND NOUR IN THAT SAME PLACE OF EXPLORING THAT AND WHAT WAS THE REFLEX TO IT AND THE SENSE OF GUILT AND SENSE OF SHAME AND IT'S WE'RE ALL OF THAT CAME FROM THAT JUST GOT BOILED DOWN TO UM A LOSER RIGHT WHICH WHICH THIS PERSON DIDN'T EVEN HAVEIN THEIR MIND LIKE I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT MYSELF THAT WIGHT RIGHT N ESS I'S SO INTERESTING RIGHT THAT OUR MEMORIES TDON'T IN IN OF THEMSELVES HAVE MEANING IS LIKE THEIR FLAT OR YOU KNOW  ER COLORLESS RIGHT AND AND THERE COLOURED IN BY THE EMOTIONS THAT WE ATTACHED TO THEM RIGHT SO SO THE IDEA THAT THATTHAT CERTAIN MEMORIES NOW BEFORE THE TRAMA WERE CHANGED RIGHT BY THE TRAMA SO I SO I TOLD THE STORI SOMETIMES A PERSON WHO LIKE ONTED A WORD WHEN THEY WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT THEY THOUGHT WAS I MI GOS IC IT SHOWS LIKE I CAN DO IT RIGHT AND GET OUT THERE THAT AFTER TRAMA THEY SALL THE WORD WITH THE NEGATIVE EMOTION ATTACHED TO IT THAT WAS LIKE ALWAYS GIVEN TO ME AN IT ND DESERVE IT AND ALMOST IT WAS BACKING LIKE THERES GOING TO BE THE GREATEST ACHIEVEINT O MY LIFE AND I WAS SEVENTEEN ORS AND TIK TO HAVE SOME ONE THINK LIKE THAT'S NOT HOW THEY FELT ABOUT THAT AT THE TIME IT'S THE TRAMA THAT CHANGED THE THI SELF TALK THE INTERNAL STATE GOING FULLWORD AND TO WHAT MIRACULOUS IN A NEGATIVE WAY ALSO CHANGE THAT GOING BACKWARD IGHT AND AND WHEN WE CAN REALLY LOOK AT THIK WORD IT THAT COME FRAM AND WE CAN START UNRAVELLING IT IT CHANGES SO IN THOSE CASES YOU OFTEN IT'S HELPFUL TO HAVE A GOOD PHERAPIST IT'S NOT ALWAYS NECESSARY AND AND IT CERTAINLY IT'S NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE RIGHT SO WE WE NEED OTHER STRATEGIES IM AND SOME OF THOSE I WRITE ABOUT SOME OF THOSE IN THE BOOK OF HOW HOW CAN WE SO TO GET AT TRAMA WITHOUT THOSE FORMALIZED MECHANISMS I'M AND SOMETIMES IF I THE SYMPTOMS ARE SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH LIKE IT WE REALLY DO NEE TO TALK TO SOMEBODY PROFESSIONAL WHO CAN WHO CAN HELP US GET TO THE ROOT OF THE TRAMA AND  SO MANY TIMES THAT'S THE ANSWER TO WHAT'S GOING ON WITH PEOPLE IN PEOPLE I'VE SEEN OF AT FIVE RESIDENTIAL STAYS I'M NOT EXAGGERATING THIS FOR MENTAL HEALTH REASONS FOR SUBSTANCE REASONS AND NO ONE'S EVER TAKEIN A TRMA HISTORY AN KNOWING YOU TAKE A TRAMA HISTORY SO WT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY WHERE THIS IS ALL COMING FROM RIHT LIKE THAT'S WHEN THE DRUG YOU STARTED TRULY THEREAFTER THE NEGATIVE SELF TALK IN E NEGATVE FEELINGS THAT LED TO THE DRUGGIES THEN YOU GO AFTER THE TRAMA AND AND YOU CAN CHANGE THINGS WHERE AS TRYING TO CHANGE THINGS WITHOUT LOOKING INTROSPECTING TALKING ABOUT THE TRAMA I I THINK OF COURSE WAS FUTIE DO YOU THINK THA PEOPLE WHO CAN START TO HAVE NEGATIVE PHANTASIES WHEN YOU MENTION THIS WOMAN WHOUD TAKE THESE LONG DRIVES TO BERATE HERSELF I'M I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT BUT I I'LL GIVE ALOBIT OF PERSONAL DISCLOSURE DR I'VE FELT I' SEVERAL TIMES IN MY LIFE THAT I WILL START TUS I' CREATE A NARRATIVE ABOUT SOMETHING THAT TRULY HASN'T HAPPEN ABOUT SOMETHING TERRIBLE THAT SOMEBODY IS GOING TO DO YES THAT'S GOING TO UPSET ME YES AND FOR THE LONGEST TIME I OUD WONDER WHY MY DOING THIS AND AND I HAVE A A COUPLE IDEAS ABOUT WHY ONE IS THAT I WAS ATTEMPTING TO JUST A VOID THINKING ABOUT OTHER THINGS IT'S JUST YOUR ANGER IS SUCH A AN ATTRACTIVE EMOTIONAL ORSON INNOCENT IT'S AN ATTRACTENT IDT'S NOT ATTRACT WE DON'T LIKE IT AND YET OFTENTIMES S A ANGER IS A GREAT WAY TO REPLACE FEELING SOME SOMETHING ELSE YES IM FEELING SAD OR HAVING COME UP OR TO DO WORK OR TO DO SOMETHING USEFUL 'M SO IT HAS THIS KIND OF UM A BUT LIK GRAVITATIONAL FORCE TO IT THAT WAS ONE IDEA THE OTHER IDEA WAS IN IMAGINING AND OF WORST OUTCOMES THEN ACT ALLY THAT RELATIONSHIP WERE COULD I SHL SEEM A LOT BETTER IN REALITY IT'S ALMOS LIKE CREATING THIS NEGATIVE CONTRAST YES LIK KNO WELL THEN IT'S NOT THAT BAD AND AND THEN THE THIRD POSSIBILITY IS I HAVE NO IDEA WHY BUT IT SEEMED LIKE A REFLECTON ID SPEND SOMETIMES THINKING ABOUT I CAN'T SAVE RESOLVED IT COMPLETELY BUT WHY WOULD SOMEBODY UM HAVE A NARRATIVE A A DEFAULT NARRATIVE WHEN DRIVING OR WHEN WALKING OF I'I'M JUST CONT SPEND SOME TIME AND AND THING ABOUT HOW TERRIBLE THIS THING IS GON A TURN OUT OR HOW SOME ONE'S WENT UPSET ME OR HARMY OR HOW TERRIBLE I AM A IT SEEMS AGAIN LIKE MALADAPT IVES THINKING MALADAPTIVE WIRING AND YET I'VE TO ASSUME THAT IT SERVE SOME PURPOSE YE YE MAY I THINK THERE THREE FACTORS THERE AND THEY'RE ALL BAD AND I N N TINK YOU SPOKE TO AT LEAST TWO OF THAT RIGHT THER THIT MAY I THINK SPEAK SO POWERFULLY TO HOW INSIDIOUS TROMA IS AND HOW THESE ARE REAL BRAIN CHANGES INSIDE OF US SO SO I WOULD SAY ATHE THREEFACTORS PUNISHMENT AVOIDANCE AND CONTROL I SO SO THE TROMA INSIDE OF US THAT THAT MAKES A GUILT AND SHAME SO OFTEN SO OFTEN LEADS TO A DESIRE TO PUNISH ONESELF IGHT AN THE IDEA THAT OH THAT WAS MY FAULT OR I DESERVE THAT WELL WHAT WHATD WE DO IF SOMETHING IS SOME ONE'S FAULT THAN SOME ONE NOW DESERVES PUNISHMENT RIGHT MEAN WWE WE PUNISH THEM RIGHT WE SEND EM TO CAIL WE GIVE THEM A FINE RIGHT WE PUNISH THEM AS SO WHAT WHAT WE DO IS PUNISH OURSELVES RIGHT  WE IF WE TELL OURSELVES WE'RE LOSERER THIS AWFUL THING IS GOING TO HAPPEN RIGHT THAN PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IS SAYING TO OURSELVES SEE RIGHT YOU DESERVE THAT YOUR NOW CAN HAVE ANYTHING BETTER RIGHTS IT'S A NEGATIVE'S A VERY NEGATIVE WAY THAT THE BRAIN TRIES TO MAKE US IN A SEND TO DO BETTER BY HURTING US MORE FOR THE THINGS THAT WE COULDN'T AND SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WERN'T EXPECTED TO BE  CONTROL IN THE FIRST PLACE I THE SECOND IS DISTRACTION AS YOU SAID ANGER THAT KIND OF FANTASY CAN DISTRACT US FROM FROM I AFFECT FEELING AN EMOTION THAT CAN BE MUCH MORE NEGATIVE YOU KNOW ANGER IT CAN BE MORE GRATIFYING THAN THEN THEN SENTLY THEN GUILT OR SHAME ALTHOUGH GUILTER AND CHANECANS ERVE A PUNISHMENT PURPOSE BUT IF ANGER IS DIRECTED ALSO TOWARDS OURSELVES RIGHT THAN IT CAN SERVE PUNISHMENT TO SO PUNISHMENT AVOIDANCE AND THE SENSE OF CONTROL THAT IF YOU THINK AHAD TE SOMETHING AWFUL THAT YOUR IMAGINING IS GOING TO HAPPEN WE MAYBE THAT WILL LET YOU AVOID IT RIGHT MEAN YOU CONSEE THE BRAIN HERE IN SINCE REALLY CONFUSE MEAN PART OF THE BRAIN WANTS TO PUNISH PART OF THE RAIN IS ONE TO THINK ABOUT IT AT ALL AND PART OF THE BRAIN WANTS TO MAKE IT BETTER AND AND THEN HOW ALL OF THAT RESOLVES IF WE'RE NOT AWARE THAT A THIS ISNIN THE CONTECTS OF OUR BRAINS BEING DEEPLY IMPACTED BY TRAMA SO WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS ALL MALADAPTIVE RIGHT AS THESE NEGATIVE FANTASIES OF THE FUTURE THEY MAY HELP US FEEL BETTER ABOUT SOMETHING IN THE PRESENT BUT THEY DON'T HELP US MAKE ANYTHING BETTER IT THEY DON'T HELP US MAKE ANYTHING BETTER SO THIS IS THE KIND OF TO SEE QUELLI THIS IS WHERE TROMAN AND ALL THIS REFLECTIVE STUFF THAT HAPPENS AFTER TROMA ULTIMATELY LEAD US AND YOU CAN SEE HOW WE GET LOST HOW I'VE SEEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN MY OWN LIFE IN THE LIVES OF OTHER PEOPLE HOW MAN WE GET STOCK IN THOSE SITUATIONS THAT'S WHY I SEE PEOPLE SOMETIMES THIS HAS BEN GOING ON FOR THIRTY YEARS FORTY YEARS RA AND IT JUST BEEN GOING ON OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN BECAUSE THERE'S NO NATURAL END TO ANY OF THIS RIGHT UNLESS WE WE LOOK AT IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAT WE'VE KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION LIKE WO THIS ISN THE WAY IT HAS TO BE LET ME BRING A NOVEL PERSPECTIVE TO THIS IT DOESN'T CHANGE ON ITS OWN IM STRUCK BY YOUR STATEMENT THAT THESE THOUGHTS OR BEHAVIORS CAN MAKE US FEEL BETTER BUT THEY DON'T ACTUALLY MAKE ANYTHING BETTER IN THAT WAY IT THIS MODE OF IMAGINING TERRIBLE OUTCOMES STARTS TO IMMEDIATELY SEEM LIKE TAKING OPIOITS A YOU KNOW IT YOU FEEL BETTER IN THE MOMENT BUT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MAKE ANYTHING BETTER AND IT I PROBABLY MAKES THINGS WORSE YES AND AND JUST AS QUESTION OF UM HOW HOW MUCH WORSE AN AND AND IN WHAT DIRECTION YES AND SO I JUST WHAT WANT A JUST PAUSE ON THAT ON THAT CONCEPT BECAUSE I THINK THAT CONCEPT OF MAKES US FEEL BETTER BUT DOESN'T MAKE ANYTHING BETTER I THINK UM  ANSWER'S AN EARLIER QUESTION ABOUT THE THIS WHAT SEEMS TO BE A TOTALLY MALADAPTOF WIRING DIAGRAM YOU KNOW WE NEED TO CONFRONT THE THING BUT WE DON'T WANT TO GO INTO THE REPETITION COMPULSIONS THERE'S A THERESIT'IT'S A KNIFE EDGE THERE TO NAVIGATE THROUGH TRAMA YES WORKING WITH A VERY SKILL CLINISTION LIKE YOURSELF I THINK IS THE IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCE FOR FOR PEOPLE UM AN OF COURSE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T ACCESS SUPPORT FROM SOMEBODY FOR WHATEVER REASON A YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT A JOURNALING YES UM AS A USEFUL TOOL AM COULD IT MAY BE O HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE OTHER A THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO ON THEIR OWN AND THEN I'D ALSO LIKE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT MAKES FOR A GOOD THERAPIST WHAT SHOULD PEOPLE LOOK FOR FOR THOSE THAT ARE OUR SEEKING THERAPY SPECIALLY NOWADAYS WHEN A LOT OF THERAPY IS BEING DONE REMOTELY BUT LET'S TO START WITH THE THE A ET JUST CALL THEM A SELF GENERATED OR ZERO COST UM SORTS OF THINGS AT JOURNALING BEING THE FIRST A TAND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHERS AND AND WHAT COND OF STRUCTURE WOULD YOU RECOMMENDE SOONE PUT AROUND JOURNALING AM TERRY TURN ROUND ALL DAY AND JOT THINGS DOWN AS THEY COME UP WOR SIT DOWN AND SPEND AN HOUR WRITING IN COMPLETE SENTENCES FOR INSTANCE YET IF I COULD ADD SOMETHING TO WHAT YOU JUST SAID BUT BEFORE THE QUESTION I THAT THAT WE HAVE THESE SHORT TERM COPING MECHANISMS IN US RIGHT AND IN WAY IT MAKE SENSE RIGHT WE FIND OURSELVES IN JUST TERRIBLE SITUATIONS THEN A SHORT TERM COPING MECHANISM CAN GET US THROUGH THEM RIGHT SO OUR BRAINS ARE BUILT THAT WAY AND THAT'S PART OF SURVIVAL TOO RIGHT AND WHETHER NOW IN THE MO OTERN WORLD WHETHER IT'S IT'S FOOD IT'S DRUGS ITS SEX IT'S  ALKOHOLL RIGHT OR IT'S NEGATIVE THOUGHTS RIGHT THIS IS SHORT TERM SOOTHING EVEN THE NEGATIVE THOUGHTS AN ANGER SHORT TERM SOOTHING AT THE EXPENSE OF LONG TERM CHANGE RIGHT AND THAT'S WHERE YOU KNOW ADDICTIVE PATHWAYS CAN'T COME INTO PLAY AND AND THAT'S WHERE AGAIN ARE HOW WE'RE BUILT EVOLUTIONARILY FOR SURVIVAL DOESN'T HELP US YOU KNOW IN THE WAY HUMANS HAVE EVOLVE U WEMENT LIVE THIS WAY THROUGHOUT YOUR MINDYN IN POI NINE SOMETHING PER CENT OF HUMAN HISTORY WRITE EN SO SO WE'RE NOT ADAPTET TO THIS SO I WANT JUST MAKE A POINT OF SAYING THAT ABOUT THE SHORT TERM SOOTHING AT THE EXPENSE OF ANY OF LONGTERM CHANGE YOU KNOW AND THEN HA THETHE QUESTION YOU HAD ASKED ABOUT TA JOURNALLING OR WHAT CAN WE DO THAT'S OUTSIDE OF A A PROFESSIONAL I THINK THE HALL MARK OF IT HAS TO BE BRINGING NEW EYES TO IT RIGHT THAT THINKING ABOUT SELF WITH A CURIOSITY INSTEAD OF JUST A SIMPLE AUTOMATICITY OR REPETITION RIGHT LIK  WHY AM I THINKING ABOUT THIS WHEN DID THIS START WHY IS THIS IN ME  THAT IT'S THAT THAT WHETHER IT'S WORDS OR WHETHER WE'RE WRITING THAT'S SO IMPORTANT SO I THINK FOR JOURNALLING IT DEPENDS ON THE PERSON YOU KNOW I WE WE KDON'T SOMEBODY CARRING ROUND A JOURNAL ALL DAY IF THEN THERE'S A COMPULSION TO ANY TO WRIT ABOUT EVERYTHING IT'S GOING ON TO MY MIND RIGHT LIKE THAT MIGHT BE GOOD TO LOOK AN WRITE A LITTLE BIT AT NIGHT RIGHT OR SOME ONE WHO MIGHT THINK YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THIS REALLY COMES INTO MY MIND IN A STRONG WAY AND IT COULD BE UNPREDICTABLE RIGHT I ON'T HAVE THTHE JOURNAL WITH ME SO AH THAT THING IS BACK IN MY MIND NOW YOU KNOW LET ME WRIT ABOUT IT RIGHT BECAUSE THEN PUTTING WORDS TO IT AND THEN BE ABLE TO READ THOSE WORDS RIGHT AND WHEN PEOPLE READ EVEN TO A LITTLE BIT OF JOURNALLING AND THEY READ OH I I THOUGHT AGAIN ABOUT HOW MATERRIBLE PERSON WHO CAN'T HAVE A GOOD LIFE BECAUSE I BECAUSE I WAS IN SUCH A BAD CAR ACCIDENT OR BECAUSE THAT PERSON ATTACKED ME OR BECAUSE WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL I WAS BULLY BECAUSE I LOOK DIFFERENT THAN EVERYONE ELSE RIGHT OR ACT ED DIFFERENT FOR EVERYONE ELSE WOW YOU KNOW 'TO ACTUALLY SEE THAT WRITTEN OW IT'S YOU KNO IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF THAT IRE'S A LITTLE BIT OF THAT WHEN YOU'RE SAYING IT TO SOME ONE AS IF IT WORE SOME ONE ELSE RIGHT BECAUSE NOW THERE'S ENOUGH DISTANCE FROM IT LIKE I'M LOOKING AT THE WORDS I WROTS RIGHT THAT WE GET SOME DISTANCE AND WE CAN START TO INTEGRATE SOME OF THE NOT JUST A COMPASSION BUT INTEGRATING COMPASSION AND LOGIC RIGHT  LIKE LOOK I FEEL A SENSE OF COMPASSION O IT WHAT IS THIS MEAN WHAT REALLY HAPPENED HERE RIGHT AND CASH I DID START THINKING DIFFERENTLY AFTER THAT I SHOUGHT IT TOT THAT'S WHERE THIS CAME FRI'M WRIGHT THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING THIS IT'S THOSE KIND OF REVOLATIONS THAT WE CAN HAVE THROUGH AGAIN THE WRITTEN OR SPOKEN WORD AND I THINK OE GET THAT INVOLVES A TRUSTED OTHER YOUR OR WRITING AND I THINK THAT THOSE ARE WAYS WE CAN DO THIS WHERE WE BRING SOME D NOVO PERSPECTIVE TO SOMETHING THAT OFTEN HAS BEEN BOUNCING AROUND INSIDE OF US AND IT'S AMAZING TO ME THAT I CAN SEE SUCH INTELLIGENT AND PATHICALLY TUNED PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD THE SAME THING RUNNING OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THEIR MIND FOR YEARS AND IT JUST POINTS OUT THAT OUR BRAINS DON'T AUTOMATICALLY SAY A WAIT A SECOND OU D HAVE IN SPNDING WHEELS HERE FOR A LONG LONG TIME LIKE WAS IN ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT THIS WE NEED SOMETHING FROM THE OUTSIDE WHICH CAN JUST BE KNOWLEDGE RIHT WHICH IS WH I THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE OR THE REASON I WROTE THE BOOK THAT I WROTE WAS WAS A APPREHENDING THIS IK IAMAZING SURPRISE TO ME RIGHT WHICH IS A WOUIC SOME HUGE PERCENTAGE OF EVERYTHING I'M TREATING IS ROOTED IN TRAMA AND THE OPACITY OF TRAMA I WHICH IS WHY WE DON'T SEE THAT OH THE DEPRESSION THE PANIC ATTACKS THE LIFE CHANGE THE EDDICTION THE KNO THE MALADAPTIVE CHOICES LIKE O THAT THIS IS ALL COMING FROM TRAMA BECAUSE IT HIDES ITSELF IN THAT IN THAT OPACITY SO WE NEED A DENOOA PERSPECTIVE IF WE'RE DOING IT ON OUR OWN AND WE NEED THAT IF WERE DOING IT IN THERAPY WHICH MIGHT LINGTH IK FINDING THE RIGHT THERAPISTRI WHICH IS ALSO PART OF YOUR YESTION I DEAFONALY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT HOW TO ASSASSIN FIND THE RIGHT THERAPIS BEFORE I WE'D A COVER THAT HOWEVER AM SOMETHING CAME UP UM IN THE COURSE OF YOUR ANSWER A I CAN IMMEDIATELY RELATE TO THIS IDEA THAT YOU KNOW CERTAIN BEHAVIORS ARE A REALLY MALADAPTIVE IN OUR AR AM STUFFING THINGS DOWN OR AVOIDING THE TOPIC AM IS PROBLEMATIC AND BRINGING IT CURIOSITY AND AN INTROSPECTION ALMOST A THIRD PERSONING OF THE UM EXPERIENCE THAT WE'VE HAD IN ORDER TO TRY AND ADDRESS IT FROM IT THROUGH AN FROM A NEW TRULY FROM A NEW PERSPECTIVE IT OCCURRED TO ME AS AS WE WERE DISCUSSING TUS HOWEVER THAT SOME PEOPLE AND AND YES MAY BE I'M TALKING WELL BE ABOUT MY OWN EXPERIENCE WE WE HAVE A SENSE OF OUR OWN IDENTITY AND OUR AND HOW PEOPLE VIEW US IN OUR ABILITY TO BEFUNCTIONAL IN THE WORLD IN WAS THAT WE LIKE EFACT IF AT WORK OR A GOOD BROTHER OR GOOD MOTHER FATHER HUMAN BEING IN THE WORLD WE HAVE RELATIONSHIPS AND I THINK THAT ONE THING THAT I HAVE HEARD A AND MAYBE I'VE EXPERIENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES THOSE AM MALADAPTIV THOUGHTS OR BEHAVIORS THE THINGS THAT GENERATE A KIND OF A  REPETITION OF ANGER OR OF AROUSAL OR ACTIVATION OR SADNESS THAT WE HAVE SOME INTERNAL PROCESS WHERE WE WE FUNNEL THAT INTO A FUNCTIONALITY IN THE WORLD SO WE AM I'LL GIVE A MORE CONCRETE EXAMPLE AM SO IN THINKING ABOUT THINGS THAT HAVE UPSET ME IN THE PAST AND IN IMAGINING A BAD OUT COMES IN THE FUTURE THERE'S A CERTAIN INTERNAL STATE OF AROUSAL THAT COMES ABOUT AND FOR MANY YEARS I WAS ABLE TO USE THAT NOT TO FEEL ANGRY BUT RATHER TO WORK AN EXSTRA THREE HOURS DAY OR IT TO UM PACK MY SCADUL WITH AM WORK AND SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT SO ECT A SHOW IN A WAY THAT I YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY WAS A VERY GOOD BROTHER TO MY SISTER FOR A INSTANCE SO IN A WAY IT WAS A AM IT WAS A TRANSFORMATION OF SOMETHING NEGATIVE INSIDE OF ME INTO A FUNCTIONALITY IN THE WORLD THAT WAS ACTUALLY VERY REWARDING AND BENEFICIAL YES AND YET IN DESCRIBING IT I CAN IMMEDIATELY SEE HOW IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL IF I COULD SOURCE FROM SOMETHING ELSE AND YET I YOU CAN IMAGINE AND AND I CAN IMAGINE HOW ONE WOULD BE AM RELUCTANT MAYBE EVEN TERRIFIED OF GIVING UP THAT SOURCE A'S A FUEL YES AND  AND I THINK IN KNOWING SOME OF THE TRAMAS OF OTHER PEOPLE AND THEIR RELUCTANCE TO WORK THROUGH THOSE IBE SA'M NOT A THERAPIST  SINCE THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT ONE'S POSITIVE IDENTITY CAN OFTEN BE LINKD TO SOMETHING DIFFICULT AN THAN AST AND SO PEOPLE ARE RELUCTANT TO GIVE UP THIS FUEL YET BECAUSE IT IT IT'S IN THAT SENSE ITS FUNCTIONAL AM THE ONLY THING THAT ALLOWED ME TO IN A START TO ADDRESS THIS AND AND WHY I'M STILL SO CURIOUS ABOUT THIS CAUSE I DON'T THINK I'VE WORK THROUGH THIS PROCES COMPLETELY UM GET ALON MORE SELF DISCLOSURE THERE IS THAT I WAS TOLD THAT THESE WORDS JUST IMAGINE HOW MUCH BETTER IT WOULD BE IF YOU COULD SOURCE FROM A DIFFERENT FUEL MA FUEL THAT FELT BETTER  MAYBE IT WAS ON THE IT WAS ON THIS THIS SENTENCE IT WAS MAYBE YOU COULD ACTUALLY BE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE YES MAYBE YOU COULD BE TEN TIMES THE BETTER BROTHER YET MAYTE YOU COULD I HAVE TEN TIMES MORE AMINSIDE OR WORK CAPACITY ET CETERA SO IT'S ON THAT HINT OF A PROMISE UM THAT I AT LEAST I WAS INSPIRED TO START LOOKING INTO THESE THINGS AND READING ABOUT TRAMA IN YOUR BOOK AND ELSEWHERE IN SEARCH A THING ABOUT THIS SO IGAIN I REALIZE TIS AS A LONG WINDEDE A QUESTIONOR SOMEWHAT COMPLEX IDEA BUT I THING OR I HOPE THAT PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO RESONATE WITH THIS IDEA THAT SOMETIMES WE WANT O STAY ATTACHED TO THE THAT THIS SHORT TERM SOOTHING THAT THE PUNISHMENT DISTRACTION OR CONTROL BECAUSE IT EVOKES THIS AROUSAL AND THEN WE CAN APPLY THAT AROUSAL YES YES THINK WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING MAP TO THINK CLINICALLY TO WHAT GIT'S CALLED SUBLIMATION SO THERE'S SOMETHING NEGATIVE INSIDE OF US BUT WEE SOOD A TRANSFER THAT ENERGY WE TRANSFER THAT INTO SOMETHING THAT IS ADAPTIVER THAT IS POSITIVE SO THE IDIVE ANGER RIGHT I THINK OF THAT THING IN IT MAKES ANGER IN ME I CHANNEL THAT INTO HARDER WORK RIGHT OR I CHANNEL THAT INTELLE CONG IN IT GOL BE NICER TO MY BROTHER SOME GRIGT SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND AND THERE'S VALIDITY TO THAT RIGHT AND IT BUT BE CAN BECOMELIC SELF JUSTIFYING IF PERSON THINKS WELL LOK LOOK AT WHAT THIS IS DOING FOR ME RIGHT I WOULDN'T WORK AS HARD WITHOUT IT TO RIGHT NOW WE SIDE TO BECOME ATTACHED TO THE TRAMA WHERE AS I THINK WHAT YOU HAD SAID IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT JUST BECAUSE WE CAN SUBLIMATE SOME OF THE NEGATIVE AFFECT FEELING EMOTION THAT COMES FROM TRAMA INTO SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE DOES IT MEAN THAT THAT'S BEST I ME KNOW WE CAN GET TO OUR DESTINATION BY TAKING A VERY CIRCURITOUS RALT RIGHT WE MIGHT WASTIN OUR GETTING THERE BUT WE GET THERE THAT DOESN'T M EAN THAT THAT'S BEST AND IT ALSO DOESN'T LOOK AT ALL THE NEGATIVE RIT THIS EXAMPLE TO WASTED FUEL WASTED TIME RIGHT WE GET SOMEWHERE BUT WE ARE NOT OPTIMIZING AND I HAVE YET TO SEE ONE PERSON WHO WHO HAS A DRESS THE TROMAT AND BECOME LESS FUNCTIONAL I IT'S ALWAYS I THE'RE JUST AS FUNCTION BUT THEY'RE HAPPIER I OR MORE FUNCTIONAL BECAUSE AS YOU SAY JUST BECAUSE WE MAY BE ABLE TO SUBLIMATE WE MAYBE WHAT'S GOING ONWOULD BE TEN TIMES BETTER I IF IF WE IF WE WEREN'T SUBLIMATING BECAUSE THE SUBLIMATION LIMITS US RIGT IT LIMITS ARE PERSPECTIVE TO ONLY WHAT WE CAN SEE AND DO THROUGH THE LENS OF THE DRAMA AND THAT IS NEVER BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVE THANK YOU FOR THAT YE YOU O YELET'S DISCUSS HOW ONE CORTER SHOULD GO ABOUT FINDING IT A REALLY GOOD THERAPIST I TIPICALLYE THES IN MY EXPERIENCEIS DONE BY WORD OF MOUTH THE OTHERS THIS PERSON YOU MIGHT WANT O WORK WITH THEM THEYRE REALLY GREA WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT ONE SHOULD LOOK FOR AND I'M SHOULD WE TAKEIN TO ACCOUNT WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE A PERSON WHO YOU KNOW FOR INSTANCE I'VE HEARD THIS FROM FROM LISTENERS ALTHOUGH I'M CLEAR I'M DEFLIY NOT TALKING BOUT MYSELF HERE IN I'M CLOAKING SOMETHING SOME PEOPLE SAY YOU KNOW I WANT A WORK WOR THE SOMATIC THERAPIST BECAUSE I'VE OUTUALLY HEARD SOME ONE SAY I THINK IN FEELS THEY YOUN I FEEL STUFF IN MY BODYSO I WANT TO WORK WITH SOME ONE WHO CAN REALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OR SOME ONE ELSE WILL SAY IM YOU KNI WANT A WORK WITH SOMEBODY WHO HAS THIS ORIENTATION OR THAT ORIENTATION OR IS AM OPEN TO MY PARTICULAR LIFE STYLE OR ISN'T GOINGTO TELL ME THAT I HAVE TO LEAVE MY RELATIONSHIP U KNO I FEE LINE PEOPLE ALREADY SHOW  TO THE QUESTION OF WHO TO WORK WITH WITH ALL THESE YOU KNOW THINGS INTERNALLY SOME OF WHICH ARE VOICE AND SOME OF WHICH O AREN'T SO I LOVE OR YOU TO TALK OF HAT MAY BE SOME OF THE THE COOR FEATURES OF A REALLY GOOD THERAPIST AND THEN HOW HOW TO LOOK FOR A THERAPIS AND ALSO HOW TO THINK ABOUT ONESSELF IN LOOKING FOR A THERAPIST BECAUSE OF I EAST KOUNT OF PREDISPOSITIONS  I WELL THI LOT OF DATA ABOUT THIS OVER OVER THE YEARS THAT FEELING AT WHAT AR THE TOP TEN I IMPORTANT FACT IS TO FIND IN A THERAPIST JUST REPEAT REPOR TEN TIMES I MEAN THAT'S THE KEY AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT IT'S PRETTY AMAZING RI BECAUSE FAR PEUTIC MODALITIES CAN BE SO DIFFERENT I AND I THINK WHAT WHAT THAT'S TELLING US IS IN A WAY SOMETHING VERY OBVIOUS RILIC WHAT IS REPORT OF ME LIKE YOU KNOWIT'S IT' SOMEBOADY'S PAYING ATTENTION RIGHT IT'S TRUSS IT'S A BACK AND FORTH IT'S IS LIKE YEVEAND I'M DOING OF DOING SOMETHING DIFFICULT I'M DOING IT WITH SOME ONE IS REALLY HELPING E SOME ONE WHO'S IN IT WITH ME RIGHT SOME ONE 'S REALLY PAYING ATTENTION WANTS ME TO BE BETTER THAT'S INDISPENSABLEIMANIS JUST INDISPENSABLE AND I WRITE IN THE BOOK IS SOME ONE A THERAPIS NOT MAKING I CONTACT OR THIS IS THE WAY THEY DO IT RI AND WE MAY GOT A FIT INTO THE BOX OF THE WAY THEY DO IT THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE HELPFUL AND IN TH EN WHAT I WHAT I THINK ABOUT THAT IS THE DIFFERENT MODALITIES IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY TELL US THAT OH THE MODALITY'S IRRELEPHANT I THINK THAT'S NOT TRUGH I THINK THAT GOOD THERAPIS ARE NOT PIGEON HOLD BY A CERTAIN MODALITY THEY THEY MAY YOU'LL COME AT THE WORLD LARGELY THROUGH A PSYCHODYNAMIC OR A S B T OR A D B T LENDS  LOTS OF DIFFERENT MEN A WAYS TO DO THERAPY BUT WHEN YOU REALLY TALK TO THOSE PEOPLE REALLY GOOD EXPERIENCE THERAPIS IT'S ALL COMING THROUGH THE VEHICLE OF THE REPORT BUT THEY'RE PRACTICALLY SHIFTING TO WHAT THE PERSON NEEDS NO I I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE AT THE IDEA THAT LIE I JUST DO THIS RIGHT I DON'T DO THAT AND WHET WHEN PEOPLE OR PIGEON HOLD THAT WAY I DON'T THINK THEY HELP THEIR PATIENTS VERY WELL RIGHT WWE HAVE TO BE DIVERSE ENOUGH TO SAY I WANT ALL THE ARROWS IN THE QUIVER RIGHT AND AND EVEN THOUGH THERE MIGHT BE ONE THAT I FAVOR AND THAT' SEME LENDS I SEE THINGS THROUGH NO I CAN BE VERSITAL I CAN SHIFT I CAN ADAPT TO WHAT THIS PERSON NEEDS AND I THINK IF IF YOU HAVE THAT IF YOU'VE GOT A IF YOU HAVE THAT YOU GOT A WINNING COMBINATION RIGHT SO PEOPLE SHOULD PERHAPS TRY A FEW THERAPISTS AND MAYBE HAVE A SESSION OR TWO OR THREE TO SEE IF THEY THE REPORTER FEELS LIKE IT'S TAKING ROUTE IS THAT YOU HAVE THAT RIGHT YEN I THINT GET'S WHYT WORD OF MOUTH IS IMPORTAND MIT IF SOMEONE YOU TRUST TELLS YOU HAY THIS IS A GOOD PERSON THAT SAYS A LOT RIGHT A ALREADY MAKES THE PRETEST PROBABILITY I'S QUITE HIGH  BUT YES IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE WHEN  PEOPLE I HAVE A THERAPIST OR THER CALLOR INSURANCE AND THER SIGNED TO THERABIS THIS THOUGHT THAT LIKE OH THAT'S THE PERSON I HAVE TO HAVE NOW AND IT'S LIKE NOW YOU SHOULD LOOK AT THAT LIKE ANY ONE AND YOU'D BE INTERVIEWING RIGHT FOR YOU'LL FOR A JOB RIGHT BUT BUT YOU GET A BRING AGAIN THE RIGHT SED OF THOUGHTS TO THAT IT'S TO BE HELP TO WRIGHT WHICH IS THAT I WANT SOME ONE WHO HAS REPORT WITH ME I DON'T WANT SOME ONE WHO'S CAN TO MAKE IT EASY RIGHT WHO'S LIKE WELL IT'S GOSHOS COW PLEASANT BECAUSE THEM THAT MEANS A'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFICULT THINGS RIGHT SO IF ONE BRINGS LIKE I KNOW THIS ISN'T CAN N BE EASY I GOT TO TALK ABOUT DIFFICULT THINGS RIGHT EVEN IF ONE DOESN'T RECOGNIZE OR GOT TO TALK ABOUT THE TROMET IN ME RIGHT BUT TO GO TO THERAPY THINKING NO IT'S I MEAN SOMETIMES IT'S ENJOYABLE BUT A LOT OF TIMES REGHD IT'S NOT RIGHT IT'S HARD WORK IT CAN BE EXCRUCIATING W CAN CRY DOING IT BUT TO SAY RIGHT THAT THAT'S HOW 'M GOINGTO BE HELPED AND I WANT SOME ONE WHO'S GOING TO DO THAT WITH ME YOU KNOW WHO WHO'S REALLY LOOKING AT WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF ME HOW DO WE HELP ME AND I CAN FEEL SORT OF THE ROBUSNESS OF THAT IF ONE BRINGS THAT APPROACH AN THEN LOOKS AT THE THERAPISTS THROUGH THAT LENS YOU'R YOU'RE VERY LIKELY TO THEN MOVE ON FROM SOMEONE WHO'S NOT A GOOD CHOICE RIGHT AND REALLY STICK WITH SOME ONE WHO IS EVEN THOUGH THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S ALWAYS PLEASANT AND ENJOYABLE MEAN TO HOUSE TO NOT BE THAT SOMETIMES RIGHT MAY WE COULD DROL LL DEEPER IN TO THE MECHANICS OF THERAPY AM I PUT OUT A FEW QUESTIONS TO AUDIENCE AND ASKING WHAT THEY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THERAPYAN IT WAS AMAZING I HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF RESPONDSE TO SAYING HOW SHOULD I SHOW UP TO THERAPY SO FOR INSTANCE SHOULD PEOPLE TAKE A FIVE MINUTES A MEDITATIVE DRO EN BEFORE OR SHOULD THEY JUST SHW UP COLD AND LET IT EMERGE UM DURING THERA BE I IS IT A GOOD IDEA TO TAKE NOTES OR DA NOT TAKE NOTES UM AND THEN POST THERA BE HOW SHOULD CLIENTS PATIENCE UM AS THE'VE SOMETIMES CALLED ONE OR THE OTHER I NEVER KNOW WHICH HOW SHOULD THEY CROSS USS THAT INFORMATION SHOULD THEY TAKE SOME DESIGNATE TIME AFTERWARDS AND YOUR AN IDEAL WE'LL TAKE A THIRTY MENUTE WALK AFTERWARDS AND THINK ABOUT THE MATERIAL OR SHOULD THEY SAT IT ASIDE AND COME BACK TO IT OF COURSE THEYRE CONSTRAINED A WORK AND FAMILY ET CETERA BUT YOU KNOW WE THERE'S A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE OUT THERE ABOUT HAD A BEST SHOW UP TO A WORK OUT I ONE OUT FOR FIVE TEN MINUTES THEN DO THIS ET CETERA AND THEN THE COOL DOWN A'M AND YOURE WERE TALKING ABOUT HARD PSYCHOLOGICAL WORK AMD A BETTERING ONESELF SO UM TO MY KNOWLEDGE I I'VE NOT EVER UM SEEN THIS INFORMATION ANYWHERE BE VERY USEFUL TO HEAR YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THUS YE WE'LL NOT TRY TO DUCK THE QUESTION BUT BUT BUT I THINK IT VARY SO MUCH BY PESENT SO YOUING BET  THE FIRST PARTO OUR QUESTION I THINK WAS HOW TO SHOW UP IF THERA BE RIGHT AND I THINK THE ANSWER WOULD BE WHATEVER LETS YOU BE FULLY PRESENT WHEN YOU'R INFHER BE NOUT FOR SOME PEOPLE THIS GOING TO BE I SHOW UP EARLY AN I SAT I CALL MYSELF AND MEDITATE A LITTLE BIT AND THAT'S HOW THEN THEIR PRESENT IGHTFOR OTHER PEOPLE  THEYS THEY WOULD SHOW UP WALKING TO THE ROOM THAT CAN STOP ANOTHER PRESENT T WOS WHATEVER WORKS FOR THAT PERSEN SO THAT THEY'RE REALLY THERE THEIR THOUGHTS THEIR ENERGY IS REALLY IN WHAT'S GOING ON AND THE SAME THING AMPLIES ON THE OTHER AND KNOW THE'RE PEOPLE WHO THERE REALLY WELL SERVEDBY YOU'L GOING FOR WALK IF THEY CAN OR SITTING QUIETLY AFTER THERE BE GOT A PUTTING THAT IN ORDER RIGHT OTHERWISE THEY LOSE SOME IF IT RIGHTER LIKE SOME OF THE AHAS RITER THE FOLLOW THAT'S AN INTERESTING THOUGHT THAT THEY REALLY NEED TO PUT IT IN ORDER MAY BE THAT INVOLVES TAKING SOME NOTES DURING THER BE RIGT FOR OTHER PEOPLE THEY NEED TO DO THE EXACT OPPOSITE THEY NEED TO LIKE LEAVE NOTHING ABOUT THAT AT ALL AND THEN THEY CAN REFLECT ON IT LATER AND LEARNED FROM IT SO YOU KNOW WERE SO DIFFERENT O HUMAN BEING THOT SUCH A DIVERSITY IN US THAT THAT I THERE'S NO HARD ANSWER TO THAT BUS THEY BEING PRESENT WHEN IT'S HAPPENING THEN BEING ABLE TO SUIT A CONSOLIDATE AND AND RETAIN  WHAT'S BEEN GAINED IS MOST IMPORTANT AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE THAT OUT PERSON BY PERSON MEAN I TRY AND DO THAT IN THE WORK OF WIKE WHAT WOULD SERVING THIS PERSON BEST AND SOMETIMES WE THEL SOMETIMES IT EVOLVES AND SOMETIMES WE TALK ABOUT IT BUT THEY VARY SO MUCH IF SOME ONE WERE THINKING ABOUT ENBARKING ON THERA BE OR MORE THERAPE I TO ADDRESS TROMA OR JUST GENERAL ISSUSE OF LIFE WHAT IS THE FREQUENCY THAT YOU RECOMMEND I COULD IMAGINE TWO EXTREME MODELS ONE AS OKEY I'M GIN A FINELY TACKLE THIS TRAMA I'M GOING TO DO THEREA BE THREE TIMES A WEEK BUT FOR A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME YE SIX MONTHS IT YOU KNOVER AND OUT AM VERSES THIS OPEN ENDED MODEL OF ONCE A WEEK TYPICALLY A FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES RIGHT RIGHT I THINK THAT ALL SO VARIES AM AND I WORK WITH PEOPLE AN VARIED WAYS FROM SOME ONE 'S DOING WELL N LIKE WE ME FOR HALF HOUR EVERY SIX MONTHS RIGHT TO DOING WEEK LONG HOURLY SESSIONS TO SPENDING THREE INTENSE DAYS WITH SOME ONE IN ER ROWN RIGHT SO I THINK AS FAR AS TI GUINA GUIDING PRINCIPLES WHAT I HAVE FOUND IN MY OWN LIFE CAUS I I I VALUE MY OWN THERAPY A I TREMENDOUSLY SO IVE FOUND IN MY OWN LIFE AND IN MY OWN CLINICAL WORK THAT IF IT'S LESS THAN ONCE A WEEK AND IT'S HARD FOR US TO RETAIN REALLY YOU KNOW E WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME KIND OF CATCHING OBAN WHAT'S HAPPENED LET'S GET BACK TO THE PLACE WE WERE AT BEFORE WHICH IS WHAT I THINK IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO GET SOMEWHERE WERE NOT JUST TRY TO MAINTAIN SOMETHING RIGHT THAN I THINK ONCE A WEEK FOR AN HOURS REALLY KIND OF THE MINIMUM RIGHT UM BUT MORE INTENSIVE WORKS LIKE THE MORE INTENS IT IS IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT LINEAR RIHTS AN EXPINANTIAL GAIN LIKE WE WE DO A LOT OF INTENSIVE WORK RIGHT WHERE T WERE SOMEONE WILL COME AND AND DO THIRTY CLINICAL HOURS WITH US OVER THE COURSE OF A WEEK SO FIVE OR SIX DIFFERENT CLINITIONS THIRTY CLINICAL HOURS AND YOU WE'VE FOUND THAT THE BENEFITS OF DOING THAT ARE IMMENSE IS I GIT'S A A YEARS WORTH OF THERABY CONSOLIDATED AND YOU TIK UILL THIRTY HOURS LETS AY N WE GO ALMOST EVERY WEEK MADE IT'S FORTY FIVE OR FIFTY HOURS BUT THIRTY HOURS WITH THAT KIND OF INTENSITY UM IS WORTH PY SIXTY HOURS YOU KNOW DONE IN A DIFFERENT WAY UM BECAUSE THEN IIT'S ITS IN US IN ANACTIVE WAY RIHT IT'S IN THE THERAPISTS IN AN ACTIVE WAY BECOMES VERY VERY DYNAMIC SO I THINK TURNING UP THE INTENSITY IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEED TO PROCESS ABSOLUTELY MAKE CENTES AND I DO THAT MY OWN LIFE IS SOMETHING NOWS IK WO SREALLY SOMETHING IS REALLY DISTRESSING ME AND IT'S LINKING INTO PRIOR TRAMA AND I CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON AN ME AND I START THAVE RUMINATIVE THOUGHTS YOU KNOW WITH NEGATIVITOMIC I HARE GO MORE RIGHT BECAUSE I GOT TO DO THAT PROCESSING SO I CAN GET TO THE PLACE THAT I AM WHICH IS NOT THAT SO THAT THE TRAMA HAS NO IMPACT ON ME RIGHT IS THAT THE IMPACT IS MUCH LAST THAN IT WAS BEFORE THE THERAPY AND THAT I MOST OFTEN MORE OFTEN THAN NOT HAVE AN ABILITY DESEE WHEN IT'S NOW INTRUDING INTO MY THOUGHTS AND IT'S TAKING ME AWAY FROM LIKE WHAT I REALLY THINK IN BELIEVE OR BEING ABLE TO DRAW LOGIC IN EMOTION TOGETHER AND MAKE OO DECISIONS TURNING UP THE INTENSITY THEN ABSOLUTELY MAKE CENT THIS A VERY DEEP UM INTENSIVE WORK OF THIRTY HOURS IN A WEEK A WHAT BRINGS SOMEBODY TO SOME ATHE TYPE OF WORK UM O THAT SORT UM IS IT A SUICIDE ORESCARTEND A ATS SEVEREDICTION OF SITUATION N OWHOW DOES ONE GAGE HOW MUCH THERABY THEY THEY OUGHT TO BE UM DOING AND I SHOULD IT ALWAYS BE ON THE THERAPISTS TO DECIDE THAT FREQUENCY UM WYOU WANT WAT WOULD BRING SOME ONE TO TO A SITUATION OF FIVE THERAPISTS AND THIRTY HOURS A WEEK IN ONE WEEK RIGHT OM RIGHT IT' IT'S USUALLY A PERSON WHO IS REALLY DISTRESSD BY SOMETHING OR YOU KNOW WHETHER THAT'S ITS IT'S SO NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THEIR LIFE ER LIFE OR SOMETIMES HE PERSON COMES TO REALIZATION IS CAN'T TAKE THIS ANY MORE RIGHT I'M I'M SICK OF TE SICLICAL DEPRESSION I CAN'T GET A STOP HAVING PANIC TERS LIK I I NEED HELP RIGHT BUT IT IT'S USUALLY SOME YOU KNO CRISIS POINT WITH THE IDEA O OF CRISIS IN THE MEANING OF OKAE SOMETHING COMES TO A HEAD AND AFTER WIT THINGS GING TO BE DIFFERENT RIGHT NOT O CRISIS AND THINGS INTO BE NEGATIVE AFTER WORDS BUT A POINT WHERE WHERE THAN THAT THAT COGNIT OF FLEXIBILITY COMES TO THE FOROF LIKE WY ANEED TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT RIGHT SO THAT THAT'S OFTEN WHAT BRINGS US NO SOMETIMES IS OTHER PEOPLE POINTING IT OUT OR IS SOMEBODY'S HAD AN INTERVENTION SOMEWHERE OR YES THAT PERSON'S BEEN HOSPITALIZED AFTER A SUICIDE A TEMT OR THEY'VE GONE BACK TO TO REHAVE AGAIN AN FOR THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME IN THEIR LIFE IS REALLY IN DANGER SOMETIMES IT'S THAT AND SOMETIMES AS TO PERSON REALIZING HE I JUST WANT I AVNT A LOOK AT MYSELF HEN UNDERSTAND MYSELF BETTER OU I KNOW THAT WHAT'S GOING ON IN ME ISN'T AS GOOD AS IT CAN BE RIGHT SO SO I THINK PEOPLE CAN COME TO IT FOR ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS AM AND I THINK YES I THINK A LOT TIMES IT WOULD BE THE THERAPIST TO SAY T LIXS MORE WORE YOU KNO MORE INTENSIVE WORK OR CAN MAKE I AA DIFFERENCE BT I THINK THE PERSON ALSO NEEDS TO YOUNO TAKE OWNERSHIP RIGHT OF THEIR OWN THERAPIANS IF I DON'T FEEL HOPED ENOUGH WELL IVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT RIGHT AND AND TALK TO THE THERAPIST ABOUT THAGAS IT MAYBE IT MAYBE THAT THERAPIST IS IN A MATCH RIGHT R MAYBE TALK TO THE THERAPIST IN THE THERAPISTS CAN CHANGE HIS A REPROACH RIGHT OR MAYBE TALK TO THE THERAPIST AND INCREASE THE FREQUENCE HE RIGHT BUT THE IDEA IS TO TO BE AWARE OF IT RIGHT AND IF ONE'S NEEDS AREN'T BEING MAT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT RATE AS PEOPLE CAN GET INTO A RHYTHM OF THERAPY WERE IT'S REALLY NOT HELPING THEM RIGHT BUT THEY EITHER FEEL SO OF NICHALISTIC ABAD LIKE AL NO BETTER AND I'M GOING TO THERPY RIGHT OR SOMETIMES THERE'S A SENSE THAT WHILE MEN THERAPY SOMEKIND OF CHECKING THAT BOX OF DOING SOMETHING FOR MYSELF BIT'S NOT REALLY GETTING ME ANYWHERE AND THEN THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT'S CONTROLLED BY THE GUILT AND SHAME AND AVOIDANCE THINKS THAT'S A GREAT IDEA RIGHT SO AGAIN THIS ABILITY TO OBSERVE OURSELVES LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON MY BEING HELPED IN THE WAY I DO I FEEL HELP RIGHT AM I IN SOME WAYS EVEN EVEN LIKE HAPPY THAT A'M NOT FEELING HELPS O ENOUGH TO FACE THIS THING I DON'T WANT A FACE RIGHT OR MI TO AFRAID TO SAY I NEED MORE HELP BYT DO WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT OURSELFES AND THIS IS WHERE THE INSURANCE SYSTEMS OFTEN ARE VERY DIFFICULTAS IT'S HARD SOMETIMES FOR PERSON IS HOWIN NEED MORE THERAPECAUSE THAT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE RIGHT SO SO THAT THERE ARE  OF NEGATIVE FACTORS IN THE WORLD AROUND US BUT ULTIMATE I THINK THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION COMES DOWN TO OBSERVING OURSELVES AND TAKING OWNERSHIP OF LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON ON US AND HOW WE'RE FEELING AND AN THEN FEELING THAT THAT UM COMMIT MET TO SELVE FOR ITO SELF CARE TO SAY I NEED TO GO CHANGE THIS AND FOR THOSE THAT A MAYBE DON'T HAVE THE MEANS OR INSURANCE OR ACCESS TO DO EVEN I'M ONE DAY WE THERE BE A IN THE JOURNALING MODEL I'M COULD ONE PERHAPS TAKE AN ENTIRE DAY AS A AWFUL AS IT MIGHT SEEM TO DO A LOT OF JOURNALING AND THINKING AND WALKING IOR DO  A SELF GENERATED INTENSIVE I'M DO YOU THINK THERE'S UTILITY TO THAT  THERE COULD BE BUT GET DEPENDS BY PERSON CAUSE THERE THERE COULD ALSO BE SOMETHING NEGATIVE ABOUT THAT OF ITS ISOME ONE WHO'S NOT AT THE POINT NOT READY FOR THAT RIGHTME WE WE DON'T COME AT YOU WE DON'T COME DIRECTLY AT THE TRAMA IMMEDIATELY AT LEAST IN MOST OF THE TIME WE DON'T DO THAT IAND AND WE OFTEN DON'T EXPLORE IT IN DEATH LIKE THIS IDEA THAT OH THAT PERSON NOWS TO GO THROUGH EVERY SECOND OF THE TRAMA IS IT SHE NOT TRUE I MEAN SOMETIMES IT IS BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE COMMON SITUATION RIG'S MORE OFTEN THAT PERSON AS TO ACKNOWLEDGE LIKE THE EXAMPLE OF LIKE I WAS SEXUALLY ABUSE AND IF THIT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND TO AND SAY O K LIKE GOSH WHAT IS THAT DONE TO ME THAT DOESN'T MEAN L LET'S PARSIDE EVERY MOMENT OF LIKE HOW THAT WAS AND THE TERROR OF THAT RIGHT SO THAT CAN LEAD PEOPLE TO A WORSE PLACE RIGHT SO SO I THINK THE IDEA OF BITING OFF SMALL PIECES SO TO SPEAK WHERE PERSON IS WRITING RIGHT OR IS TALKING BUI THINK IF ONE IS WRITING IT IS GOOD TO COMMUNICATE WITH ANOTHER RIGHT ANOTHER TRUSTED PERSON AND IF THERE'S NOT SOMEONE IN ONE'S PERSONAL LIFE N THERE CLERGY MEMBERS EVEN IF ONE ISN'T EFFILIATED WITH AN ORGANIZED RELIGION I OULD PROBABLY GO PLACES AND GET A CLERGY TO ONE TO HELP YOU RIGHT I MEN THERE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WANT TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE SO IS IT WOULD IF SOME ONE HAS NO ONE MEAN ALMOST NEVER DO WE HAVE NO ONE HERE RIGHT AS WE COULD PROBYE GO FIND SOME ONE BUT WE WE WE NEED TO A TAKE THAT IN PIECES SO THERE'S SOME RISK OT TRYING TO DO THE INTENSIVE THING YOU KNOW ON ONE'S OWN AND AND THAT'S WHER I WOULD PUT IN IF WE'VE A PERSONS HAVING SUICIDAL THOUGHTS OR EVEN THOUGHTS OF DEATH OF NOT WANTING TO BE ALIVE I DON'T DESERVE TO BE ALIVE MEAN THESE ERE WARNING SIGNS FOR REALLY GETTING HELP SO THERE ARE SOME SIGNS TOT SAY HE DON'T TRY AND DO THAT ON YOUR OWN RIGHT GO TO GO TRY AND FIND A RESOURCE AND IT'S  NO THINGS IT GET TO THAT LEVEL OF SEVERITY OF AAN OFTEN A PERSON KNOWS THAT OF ME AND I IN A PLACE WHERE I KNOW I'M NOT HEALTHY AND I'M I'M HAVING IN A KIND OF SCARY THOUGHTS THAN THEN WE NEED THAT THAT'S A PERSON WHO REALLY SHOULD BE DOING THAT ON THE ROWN VER THANK YOU FOR THAT YE WELCOME SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT TALKING AND I'M NOW I'D LIKE TO TALK A A BIT ABOUT CHEMISTRY YES I'M DRUGS YES I'M SO MAY BE FIRST WE COULD TALK PRESCRIPTION DRGS YOU'RE PSYCHITRES O YOU'RE APPROVE TO AND PRESENTLY DO PRESCRIBE MEDICATION I'M WERE WERE APPROPRIATE NTHIS IS A VAST LANDSCAPE OF COURSE WE'VE GOT EIGHTY H T I SHOULD JUST TELL YOU I GET MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT EIGHTY  T AND THE DRUGS RELATED T GHTY HT AND DOPEMING THAN ANY OTHER TOPIC ANY OTHER TOPIC SO THERE'S EIGHTY EIGHTE THERE'S O SEDY THERE'S DEPRESSION THERE'S ANTA TEPRESSAN AND SO FORTH IS THERE SOME WAY THAT WE CAN YOU WRAP OUR ARMS ROUND ALL OF THAT AT AS A WAY OF WATING INTO THIS TAT ON THIS DRUG QUESTION AND JUST ADDRESS YOU KNOW HOW DOES ONE DECIDE WHEN MEDICATION IS USEFUL BECAUSE IN THE END IM THE DISSECTION TOOL THAT THE PSYCHIATRIS STORES THEIRAPISE HAS IS LANGUAGE AND IT SOME POINT ONE HAS TO MAKE AN ASSESSMENT ABOUT DOPAMINE OR SARATONAN OR RATHER NOT A GIVEN DRUG WOULD HELP AND MOST THERAPES I BELIEVE DON'T INVOLVE AM PUTTING SOME ONE IN A BRAIN SCANNER AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE STILL IS NOT A VERY GOOD BLOOD TESS TO ASSESS ALWAYS TOS PERSONS DOPENMIN LOW OR HIGH CORECT ME IF I'M WRONG AND ULTIMATELY THAT A AND INOTHER COMPANIES OUT THERES SO'M NOT TRY TO UNDER MIND THOSE COMPANIES BUT IF I HAPPEN TO DO THAT IN THE STATEMENT IF IF YOU TAKE A BLOODSESS AND FIND THAT YOUR SERATONE AND METABOLITES ARE LOW MY NDERSTANDING IS IT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT YOU ARE TOO LOW IN SERATONENT IN THE BRAIN BUT THAT'S A VERY INDIRECT WINDOW INTO WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON SO HOW D HOW DOES THE HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN THE CONTECTS OF TREATING A TRAMA AND OTHER IN OTHER CONDITIONS AND THEN MAYBE WILL DRILL INTO SOME OF THE MORE SPECIFIC CONDITIONS SURE V NOWIT FIRST COMMENT THAT  THERE AREN'NT TESTS FOR THESE THINGS AND I THIN THE TEST FOR MATABOLITES NANG THINGS ARE SO DIFFERENT YOU KOW BY THE TIME WHAT WE'RE TALKING MADIBEN METABOLIZED YOU KNOW OFTEN TO SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT EXTENT LEFT THE BRAIN NOWTS IN THE PURFRUAL BLOOD THAT WE REALLY DON'T LEARN FROM THAT AND I THINK THAT WE TEND TO OVER UTILIZED MEDICINES IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE WE HAVE A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT THAT OFTEN ITHIT'S SO BASED ONS TROUGH PUT THAT WE WANT TO POLISHE THE HOOD WHEN THIS A PROBLEM IN THE ENGINE RIGHT SO WE OVER UTILIZED MEDICINES OFTEN AS AN END POINT I ALWAY CAN MAKE THAT PERSONS DEPRESSION BETTER WITH AN ANTI DEPRESSENT WELL I MEAN MAYBE RIGHT BUT MOST OF THE TIME FOR THE PRESONS DEPRESSION TO REALLY GET BETTER AND STAY BETTER THEY NEED TO UNRAVEL WHAT'S DRIVING THE DEPRESSION RIGHT SO THE FIRST STEP IS I THINK THERE CUT TWO STEPS TO IT RIT THE FIRST ASSESSMEN STEP IS IS THERE A DIAGNOSIS THAT THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE TIME IF NOT SOMETHINGS ALL THE TIME REALLY WARRANTS A MEDICINE SO THE BY POLAR DISORDER O C D A D D  THESE ARE DIAGNOSES THAT WE WE UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT THEM AND WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE BRAIN AND HOW MEDICINES CAN TREAT OR STABILIZE THAT WHICH DOESN'T MEAN THE MEDICINEIS NECESSARILY IT'S NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR THERAPY  BUT SOMETIMES THE MEDICINE AND THERAPY CAN GO HAND IN HAND SO FOR OSE DE FOR EXAMPLE WARRANTS THERAPY BUT IT ALMOST NOT ALWAYS BUT IT ALMOST ALWAYS WARRANTS MEDICINE TOO SO THAT YOU CAN EASE THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE MAKING THE RIGIDITY IN THE REPETITION IN THE BRAIN SO SO THE FIRST KIND OF BRANCH POINT CAN BE WHAT IS THE DIAGNOSIS WHAT IS THE LEVEL OF SEVERITY AND I THINK THAT THAT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT  WHERE I THINK IT'S A LITTLE MORE IT MAYBE EVEN INTERESTING IS USING MEDICINES TO HELP THE PERSON ENGAGE IN THE THERAPY AS PRODUCTIVELY AS POSSIBLE AND AND HERES WHERE I THINK WEARE SO LIMITED BY HOW WE CATEGORIZE MEDICINES AND THIS SOT OF FARMISUTACLINSURANCE DRIVEN A MEDICAL SYSTEM WE HAVE THAT I THINK THROWS AS OFF IN TREMENDOUS WAY SO YOU THINK ABOUT HOW MEDICINES ARE CATEGORIZE O ANTI DEPRESSENCS IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HELPED BY ANTI TO PRESSINES THEYR NOT THEY DON'T HAVE CLINICALLY SEVERE DEPRESSION RIGHT THOSE MEDICINES CREATE MORE DISTRESS TOLERANCE IN US RIN IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW HELPFUL THAT CAN BE IF YOU CAN TO GO N EGGING TO DO SOMETHING DIFFICULT RYGAN O BRING THAT TROMO OR THE STRESSORS TO THE SURFACE AND GIN A PROCESS AND YOU GEN A TRY AND MAKE LIFE CHANGE IF WE CAN MAKE MORE DISTRESS TOLERANCE IN US THAT CAN BE SO SO MUCH BETTER RIGHT AND THINK BY THE CATEGORY OF MEDICINES THAT ARE CAUGHT ANTICYCOTICS WHICH WHICH REALLY PUTS PEOPLE OFF RIGTIN BUT BUT MOST OF THE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR ANTIPSYCOTICS ARE NOT FOR PSYCHOSIS RIGHT AND THEIR WAYS IN WHICH LOW DOSING OF SOME OF THOSE MEDICINES CAND HELP IN TERVENE IN NEGATIVE PATHWAYS RIGHT IN PATHWAYS THAT ARE ABOUT DISTRESS AND YOU KNOW SENDING OUT THOSE TENDRILS OF NURONS THAT ARE ABOUT HYPERVIGILANCE AND A AVOIDANCE RIGHT IN OUR IN OUR BRAIN AND WE CAN OFTEN GET AT THAT AND IF YOU CAN IMPROVE SOME ONE'S DISTRESS TOLERANC AND YOU CAN USE MEDICINES THAT THAT TAKE AWAY WHAT CLINICALLY IS RUMINATION RIGHT NOT AT NOT THE STANDARD MEANING OF THAT WORD BUT THE CLINICAL MEANING OF IT WHERE THEIR DISTRESS CENTERS IN OUR BRAINS THAT ARE OVER ACTIVE AND THEN WE GET STUCK IN THESE MALADAPTIVE NEGATIVE PATHWAYS WHEN WE THINK ABOUT SOMETHING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIND WITH NO REAL CHANCE OF SOLVING IT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF US SO MEDICINES CAN HELP THAT BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY AROUND THEIR CONCEPTION AND THOUG THE MODERN MEDICAL SYSTEM OF THE FIFTEEN MINUTE VISITS YOU KNOW TO A PCYCHIATRIS THAT ARE THAT ARE WEAKS APARD TO MEAN I DO'T UNDERSTAND HOW HOW THAT GOES WELL RIGHT IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF TIMES I THINK IT DOESN'T GO WELL BECAUSE IT'S NOT ENOUGH TIME TO DO THE THERAP YE EVEN GENERATE THE UNDERSTANDING SO THEN MEDICINES GET THROWN OF THE PERSON THIS IS HOW YOU WE USE I THINK A PROXIMATELY FIVE TIMES AS MUCH MEDICINE AND THINK ACROSS THE BORD TO SAY THE DUTCH POPULATION RIGHT IN TINK WHY IS FIVE TIMES MORE AS A LOT MORE MEDICINE RIGHT AND THE O THAT THEY THAT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND AN A CULTURAL SYSTEM THAT TO THE BEST OF MY UNDERSTANDING IS MORE ROOTED IN TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR ONESELF RIGHT SO IF A PERSON COMES IN IN COLLESSDER ALL IS HI RIGHT THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS IS HE COUL TAKE BETTER CARE OF YOURSELF RIGHT LIKE THIS PERSON REALLY NEEDS TO LOSE SOME WAY IT EXERCISE MORE RIGT THEYDN'T AN NOT JUST JUMPING TILL I M GIVE YOUR MEDICINE AND NO AND SHIP SHIFTYU THROUGH THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND OUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR RIGHT AND THE SAME THING IS TRUE IN MENTAL HEALTH NO AND I AN NO NOT TRY TO BE CRITICAL TO TO THE PSYCHIATRIS O THE NURSE PRACTITIONERS A PEOPLE WHO ARE PRACTICING IN THAT WAY BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES THERE IS NO CHOICE RIGHT IF THE'R WORKING IN A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT THAT THE STANDARD IS IS IS I'M HIGHLY SPACE OR SPACE TEPART FIFTEEN MENUTE VISITS WHAT ALTERNATIVE IS THERE RIGHT BUT TO LOOK AT OOK OUT I'M GOING TO USE MEDICINES BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANOTHER TOOL TO BRING TO BEAR SO I THINK THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND ITS FOCUS ON THROUGH PUT AND IT'S SHORT TERM TIME OUT ON WE TOE UT SHORT TERM RESPONSE RIGHT THER SHORT TERMS SOOTHING AT THE EXPENSE OF LONG TERM HEALTH AND I THINK THAT IS THE MEDAPHOR FOR THAT APPLIES TO OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM RIGHT WERE IF IF WE IF WE ARE GOING TO TRYING TREAT O SYMPTEM IN A SHORT TERM WER CUN DO IT IN A FIFTEEN MENUTE VISIT THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT MAYBE IT SOOTHE TO SYMPTEM MAYBE IT DOESN'T BUT IT DOES NOT GET AT THE PROBLEM WE NEED TO INVEST MORE RESOURCECE TO GET AT THE PROBLEM AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE A SORT OF PROTEST YOU KNOW IF PEOPLE AS A SOCIETY WE LOOK WE DON'T LIKE THE WAY OUR HEALTH CARE IS GOING IF WE NEED MORE FOCUS ON WHAT THE ACTUAL PROBLEMS ARE THAT YES WE WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY YOU DO DO TREATING PEOPLE O TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE CASE MORE HUMAN TIME BUT ULTIMATELY BU LESS SUFFERING LESS DEATH RIGHT AND ULTIMATELY MORE PRODUCTIVITY I THINK AS AN ECONOMY WE WOULD SAVE SO MUCH MONEY IF WE SPEND MONEY ON THE HUMAN ASPECTS OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD BE MORE FUNCTION ALL THER' SPENDING LESS TIME IN THE HOSPITALL RIGHT THAT THERE THE'RE MORE PRODUCTIVE WHEN THEY'RE WORKING I'M THERE'S LESS ENTRY INTO THE CRIMINAL COMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO SO THINK MEDICINES GET OVERUSED IT IMPART FOR SYSTEMIC REASONS I'M IN LARGE PART FOR SYSTEMIC REASONS I'M AND ALSO FOR SOME OF THES CATEGORIZATION REASONS OH THAT PERSON MEETS SOME TECHNICAL CRITERIA FOR DEPRESSION WE GOTG TO GIVE THEM THIS MEDICINE INSTEAD OF REALLY THINKING WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS PERSON I SEE THIS OVER AND OVER GAIN I SEES ONE IS ON SEVEN MEDICINS AND WRON'T SEVEN MEDICINES TO TREAT SEVEN DIFFERENT SYMPTEMS AND OTHER AV SID AFFECTS FROM ALL THOSE SEVEN MEDICINES MAYBE TWO OF THEM ARE TO TREAT THE SIDE EFFECTS FROM THE OTHER FIVE RIGHT AND THAT'S BAD IHT AND IF YOU REALLY GET AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEM THE THE'R DOING MUCH BETTER AND MAY BE THERE ON TWO MEDICINES  SO AN'L THAT'S AN  HOPEFUL ANSWER TO THAT IS IT'S A VERY HELPFUL ANSWER I MEAN I THINK 'M AT LEASTIN THE SPIRIS THAT I RUN THESE DAYS I HEAR A LOT OF NEGATIVE STATEMENTS ABOUT AUNTI DEPRESSENTS I THINK YOU KNOW I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THE BOOK A LISTENING TO PROSAGAND I REMEMBER WHEN PROSAC AN AND IT'S UM AND THINGS LIKE AT FIRST STARTED SHOWING OUP IN THE EXCITEMEN AN THEN NOWADAYS I HEAR MORE ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WITH ALL THESE TRUGS YOU KNOWIN AND MAYBE THAT'S JUST CAUSE I HAVE ARMS IN THE BUT THE SCIENTIFIC BUT ALSO IN THE CONT A WELLNOSS COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE THINK A LOT ABOUT BEHAVIOUR'LL CHANGE FORTUNATELY I THINK THAT'S HAT THAT THEY DO THAT I'M BUT OF COURSE THESE DRUGS AS YOU MENTION CAN HAVE THE NORMOUS UTILITY AS WELL I'D LIKE TO JUST A PICK UP ON ONE THENE UM THAT I HAVEN'T HEARD A LOT ABOUT ANYWHERE ELSE WHICH IS THE SHORT TERMERS IS THE LONG TERM USE OF THESE DRUGS AS I COULD IMAGIN YOU KNOW SOME ONE FEELING LIKE THE FINALLIYG IN A TACKLE SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN INSIDE THEM FOR A LONG TIME EITHER BECAUSE THERE REALLY STRUGGLING OR BECAUE THEY'RE JUST DONE WITH NOT WORKING IT THROUGH AND AM AND THEY DECIDE TO START A MEDICATION A THAT WOULD GIVE THEM HIGHER LEVELS OF DISTRESS TOLERANCE FOR A SHORT WHILE I MEAN ITS HRAINING TO SAY THAT SOMEONE COULDN'T TAKE UP A PROPERLY PRESCRIBE A MEDICATION FOR A WEEK OR FOR A THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THE WORK AND THEN KNOW THAT THEY CAN COME OFF IT BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE THE BLACK AND WHITE MODEL ABOUT GET YOU REAVING A START THE DRUG AND SLAY ON IT FOREVER OR BE TAKING SOME DRUGS FOREVER OR YOU NIT CAN'T TAKE ANYTHING AN AD THAT JUSSEEMS TO LIFE DOESN'T DOES LIFE OVE AT WORK THAT WAY RIGHT IS THERE IS THER SHORT TERM USE THAT CAN BE EFFECTIVE ABSOLUTELY YES AS IN AMERICAN MEDICINE WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER AT STARTING MEDICINES THAN WE ARE AT TAKING THEM AWAY RIGHT AND PART OF THAT I THINK IS DRIVEN BY SUCH A STRONG PRESENCE OF THE FARMI SUITABLE INDUSTRY AND THE FARM SOLINES PHARMOSUITACALE INDISTRY DOES A LOT OF VERY GOOD THINGS BUT YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S SUCH THING AS TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING RIGHT AND THEN AS A SOCIETY WHEN SOMETHING SEEMS POSITIVE THIS I THINK ALSO IS HUMAN NATURE WE CAN OVERINVEST IN IT RIGHT SO YOU THINK ABOUT WHEN PROSAC AND TTHOSE KINDS OF MEDICINES CAME OUT THEY WERE SAFER MEDICINES THER BUILDAS ANTIE TO PRESSENS AND TH THOUGHT WILS WILLTHEYREGIN A FIXED EPRESSION RIGHT TIT IS NOT HOW THAT WORKS RIGHT SO WE LOOK AT THEM AS TOOLS RIGHT THEN WE CAN DEPLOY THEM SOMETIMES FOR THE LONGER TERM TO SOMETIMES THAT'S NECESSARY BUT ABSOLUTELY FOR THE SHORTER TERMING ABSOLUTELY IF WE THOUGHT OF PROSAC AN THOSE KIND OF MEDICINES NOT AS O THEIR ANTIE TE PRESSENCS WIH THAT WHAT THEY DO IS THEY THEY THEY SEEM TO MAKE THERE BE MORE SERE ATONE AND IN CERTAIN CIRCUITS THATAR IMPORTANT FOR MOOD REGULATION ANXIETY REGULATION DISTRESS TOLERANCE SO THOSE MEDICINES CAN REALLY HELP SOMEBODY IF THEY'RE VERY SEVERELY DEPRESS AND WE WANTITS WHO TO GET TO GET THEM FEELING BETTER THEY CAN ALSO HELP SOME ONE IF THEY COULD NEETUSE MORE DISTRESS TOLERANCE IN A DISCREET PERIOD OF TIME RIGHT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THEM THAT WAY WE THINK ABOUT THEM AS TOOLS THAT WE COULD APPLY FOR SHORT TERM OR LONG TERN WE DON'T SEE THEM AS FIXES RIGHT AND WE DON'T SEE THEM AS THAN SUBSTITUTES FOR THE HUMAN TO HUMAN WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE MEAN IHT YOU KNOW BEN IS  IN MY TRAINING AT TIMES IN HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AND I'VE SEEN IN MANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LOOK AT MEDICINES AS ANSERS AND THIS IDEA THAT OH THAT PERSON IS A AND A LIE TIMES DO BE A NUMBER RIGHT N NUMBER IS THE DIAGNOSIS AND THAT NUMBER GETS THIS MEDICINE AND I I'M NOT SURE WE COULD BE MORE MISGUIDED THAND THAT AND THAT'S WHAT LEADS TO ADDING MEDICINES ADDING MEDICINES IS NOT WORKING OF COURSE IT'S NOT WORKING YOU KNOW BECAUSE NO ONE'S REALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON SO ADD MORE MEDICINES AND MEDICINES FOR THE MEDICINES AND WHEN WE KNOW THIS IS TRUE WE WE DID WE KNOW THIS IS TRUE BUT WE HAVEN'T HAD THE WHEREWITHAL AS A SOCIETY TO SAY LIKE WITH A LOT OF THINGS IN SOCIETY TO SAY LIKE THIS IS AN OK D ME WE NEED MOR GIVE THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO HELP US IF ANY MORE LATITUDE TO HELP US BUT WE NEED MORE HUMAN TO HUMAN CONTACT TO GET AT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON AND YES THAT'S AN INVESTMENT OF TIME AND ENERGY AND MONEY IN THE SHORT TERM AND SOMETIMES THAT'S MONEY FROM THE SYSTEMS RIGHT BUT IF WE DO THAT GOODNESS LOOK AT THE LOOK AT THE PAY OFF OF THAT WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHT ABOUT ANXIETY AND EIGHTY H T AS SEPARATE PHENOMENA ET IN TERMS OF MEDICATION UM AGAIND EIGHT H D IS THE THE THIN THAT SEEMS TO COME UP MOST IN QUESTIONS I CAN'T TELL YOU THE NUMBER OF ESPECIALLY STUDENTS BUT ALSO YOUNG WORKING PROFESSIONALS AND UM EVEN  PEOPLE WHO ARE YOU KNOW OUTSIDE THOSE CATEGORIES WO ARE INTERESTED IN OR TAKING UM RIDDLE AN ATER ALL MODAPHINEL ARMODAPHINAL OR VIVE ANTS BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO STRUGGLE FOCUSSING WITHOUT IT OR I DON'T KNOW CAS I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS OR BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO DISLIKE HOW WELL THEY CAN FOCUS WHEN THEY DO TAKE THOSE COMPOUNDS UM AND SO MINER SHENDING AS THESE COMPOUNDS MAINLY INCREASE DOPOMANURGIC TRANSUBMISSION IN THE BRAIN ALSO A DRENNALEAN EPINEFFERING IN THE BRAIN 'S THE MORE LESS STIMULANTS THEY LOOK A LOT LIKE AT LEAST CHEMICALLY THEY LOOK A LOT LIKE COKENE AN EMPEDAMINE ALTHOUGH THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT QUITE COKENE AN ENEDAMING SO SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AM IS IS A A DIFFERENT SORT OF EPIDEMIC UM CAN THESE DRUGS BE USED TO TRAIN THE BRAIN TO FOCUS AND THAN PEOPLE CAN WITHDRAW FROM THESE DRUGS II THINK THIS IS A HUGE TOPIC AND ONE THAT MAYBE WARRANTS IT'S OWN EPISODE ENTIRELY BUT SALLS WERE ON THE TOPIC WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT MEDICATION FOR EIGHTY H TO TO MEDICATION FOR IGHTY H T CAN BE EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE AND THE STUDY SHOW SHOW US THAT THEY SHOW US THAT IF THERE IS EG D D THEN MEDICATION FOR HD D IS VERY VERY HELPFUL AND THAT'S TRUE IN YOUTHS IT SEEMS TO BE TRUE IF ADULTS HAVE ADOLT EIGHDY H D RAHD D WE WE CANN'T KNOW THAT'S TRUE BUT ALL ATTENTION DEFICID IS NOT ATTENTION DEFICITE DISORDER  AND THERE WE GO TO THE REFLECTIVE FIFTEEN MINUTE VISITS THROW MEDICINES AT THINGS  ATTENTION DEFISIT CAN COME FROM MANY MANY PLACES AND ONE OF THEM IS ANXIETY  THER THERE'S SO MANY OTHER REASONS DEPRESSIN AFFECTS ATTENTION POOR SLEEP AFFECTS ATTENTION POOR DIET CAN AFFECT ATTENTION STRESSIN LIFE CAN AFFECT ATTENTION SO AND IS CERTAINLY TRAMA AND THE THING THAT THE PROMISAT TROMISPINSOFF CAN AFECT ATTENTION SO EN THIS IS REALY THIS IS AREALLY THE TRUTH THAT WHILE TEACHING ONCE ABOUT MEDICINES AN PHARMACOLOGY I WAS FRUSTRATED ABOUT HOW THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING WAS LIKE WHAT MEDICINE TO E USE WHAT MEDICINE DO WE USE AS A POSE TO LIKE THIS IS JUST ONE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE AND I TOLD AN ANEC DO WHICH I THINK IT WAS A CLINICAL ANECDOTE LIKE WHAT YOU THINK IS GOING ON AND I THINK THAT IF I TOLD THAT TO THAT AR MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS IS SOMEHING THY WOULD PROBABLY SAY YOU JUST TOLD THE STORY OF A PERSON WITH A ROCK IN THEIR SUE WHICH IS WHAT I THE STORY THAT I WAS ACTUALLY KELLING I BUT SEVERAL PEOPLE I WAS TALKING TO THEIR PHYSICIANS I W T A D D ELIKE NOTHEREVERY NOTHER PERSON STEPS DOWN THE ROCK HURTS AND HEY'RE NOT ABLE TO MAINTAIN ATTENTION RIGHT  THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON BUT WE'RE SO PROGRAM TO THINK ABOUT MEDICINES AND IN APPROPRIATE USE OF A D D MEDICINES AS YOU SAID THERE'S DOP O MANERGIC IN PACT THERE'S EPINEFRA NOUROPE AN EFOR AN IMPACT WE'RE EFFECTING WHAT ARE OT PREFRONTAL ALPHA TWO RECEPTORS THAT LIKE REALLY NEED TO BE HELPED IF THERE'S REAL A D D BUT IF THERE ISN'T THAT IS NOT A GOOD THING TO DO WHICH IS WHY IT IS QUITE FASCINATING THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE A D D THEY TOLERATE GENERALLY STIMULANTS VERY WELL WITHOUT THE OTHER PROBLEMS THAT CAN COME OF STIMULANTS AND AND I DON'T KNOW DON'T CLING TO KNOW WHY THAT IS BUT WE WE SEE THAT PHENOMENON BUT WHEN PEOPLE ARE BEING TREATED FOR A D D AND THEY DON'T HAVE A D D WHICH SOMETIMES THEY KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE A D D BUT THE STIMULANTS MAKE THEM FUNCTION BETTER SO THEY GO TO SOMEBODY GET THE STIMULANTS THAT'S THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING TO DO AKE IS GOD STIMULANTS WHEN THEY'RE NOT NEEDED OVER TIME THEY DO AFFECT OUR PHYSICAL FUNCTION THEY EFFECT OUR JUDGMENT TRIT THEY'RE LOT OF NEGATIVE THINGS THAT COME FROM THAT THEY CAN EFFECT THE VIGILANCE IN SIDE OF US SO SO YES IT'S A VALAD DIAGNOSIS BUT IT GETS MADE WHEN IT'S NOT PRESENT VERY OFTEN I'M WHICH WE SEE WITH A LOT OF DIAGNOSES THAT YOU CAN THROW MEDICINE AT WE SEE THE SAME THING WITH MY POLAR DISORDER TRUE BY POLAR DISORDERS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO UTILIZED MEDICINES EFFECTIVELY BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE DIAGNOSE WITH MY POET ISORDER WHO AVE THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY DON'T A BY POLAR DISORDER I'M BUT IT'S IT COULD BE A CACHAL DIAGNOSIS BECAUSE THERE'S IN A SET SOMETHING TO DO FOR IT IN QUOTS RIGHT AND YOU CAN THROW MEDICINE AT IT RIGHT SO AN MEAN WHAT WE EXPECT RIGHT IF WE HAVE IF WE HAVE A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WERE YOU FIFTEEN MINUTE VISITS WITH YOUR PSYCHIATRS OF COURSE WERE GING TO THROW MEDICINES AT EVERYTHING AND THEN THE TRAINING PARADIMES ARE GING TO LOOK AT IT THROUGH THAT LENDS AND THEN VERY OFTEN CAND I GIVE THE EXAMPLE OF SEEING SOMEBODY ON SEVEN MEDICINES MEAN THE FIRST THOUGHT I HAVE IS HOW MANY OF THOSE MEDICINES ARE ACTUALLY COUNTER PRODUCTIVE AND A LOT OF THE TIMES S NO'T LIKE L EVERY NOW AND THEN ONE IS COUNTER PRODUCTIVE NOW THAT'S THE CASE THAT'S THE CASE A LOT OF THE TIME AND AGAIN I COME BACK TO IF WE'RE NOT PUTTING THOUGHT INTO IT WHAT AR THE RESULT WOULD WE EXPECT THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSER I A VERY CURIOUS WHAT CONSTITUTES NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF STIMULANT SO IF SOMEBOD E'S TAKIN AT AR ALL ARE RIDDLEIN IN ORDER TO WORK LONGER HOURS OR FOCUS BECAUSE THEY HAVE ATTENTION DEFFIS IT BUT NOT NECESSARILY IHT HT AND A GAN I'M NOT RECOMMENDING ANY ONE DO THAS I'VE JUST HEARD THE NUMBERS THAT HAVE COME BACK THE LEAST FROM SURVEYS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH COLLEGS AT STAMFORD AND ELSEWHERE OTHER COLLEGE CAMPSES THAT UPWARDS OF SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF COLLEGE STUDENTS USE SEMI REGULARLY THESE DRUGS OFF NOT BY PRESCRIPTION JUST TO STUDY IN TO LEARN YE WELL I CAN IMAGINE SLEEP ISSUES BECAUSE PEOPLE BECAUSE THESE ARE STIMULANTS O WHAT SORTS OF OTHER ISSUES CAN THEY CURCREATE FOR PEOPLE PROBLEMS LE YOU AFREIT I THINK A TOUCHSTONE MAYBE FOR THAT'S RUNNING THROUGH OUR CONVERSATION IN IS PRIORATIZING THE SHORT TURN BENEFIT OVER SOLVING A LONG TURN PROBLEM I WISH WE MIGHT SAY IS A HUMAN TENDENCY AND AND WE SEE IT ACROSS THE TOPICS THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING SO SO SHORT TERM USE OF STIMULANS SIRT PEOPLE AR MORE LERT THEY CAN STAY AWAKE MORE THEY CAN STUDY MORE INTENSELY AND LONGER OKAT THEYR'S SOME SHORT TERN BENEFIT OF THAT OER THERE EVEN THERE THERE CAN BE PROBLEMS RIGHT THERE THERE BUT BUT WE CAN WE CAN SAY LET LESS YOU SAY FOR SAKE OF ARGUMENT THAT IN THE SHORT TURN THERE'E SOMETHING TO BE GAIN BY DOING THAT RIGHT BUT EL MY GOODNESS TERE SO MUCH THAT IS THERE'E SO MUCH RISK TO THAT RIGHT AND HOW MANY TIMES IF I SEEN SOME ONE WHO THEY'RE DOING THAT AND THEY'RE JUST DOING THAT TO STUDY RIGHT AND NOW THEY'RE ADDICTED TO THE AMPHETA MEANS AND THEY'RE BEHAVIOR CHANGE IS AND THEY DON'T KNOW IT TALK ABOUT SHIFTING OUR BRAIN TOWARDS A MORE DEFENSIVE ITO SOT O SUSPICIOUS OUTWARD LOOK YOU VIEW OF THE WORLD THAT WE SEE A LOT OF THAT SO WE SEE JUDGMENT IN PARAMENT WE SEE HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF ANXIETY WE SEE MORE IMPULSIVITY IN DECISION MAKING AND AND SOMETIMES WE IT CAN GET TO THE POINT OF SEEING FRANK PCYCHOSIS NOW THAT'S NOT COMMON BUT IF I SEEN YOUNG PEOPLE WHO'VE DONE EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING RE THEYE THEY'RE USING THEY'RE USING OUT OR ALL OF THE USING RIDDLE IN TO STUDY AND THEN I SEE THEM WHEN THEY'RE COMING IN TO THE HOSPITAL THEE SCREAMING ABOUT HOUSE SOME ONE'S TRYING TO HURT THEM BOY THEN IT'S THE WORST CASE AN ARIO BUT IT SHOWS LIKE THAT'S WHERE THAT CAN GO AND HOW MUCH IS THERE BETWEEN THAT I'M JUST USING IT TO STUDY AND THAT SEVERE YO OUTCOME THAT IS ACTUALLY QUITE NEGATIVE FOR PERSON AND MIGHT CHANGE HOW THEY THINK ABOUT THAT FRIENDSHIP OR THAT RELATIONSHIP RIGHT A LOT NEGATIVE HAPPENS WHEN WE CHANGE OUR BRAINS WITHOUT INABILITY TO SEE LIKE WHAT IS IT ACTUALLY DOING TO US O WHICH IS PART OF MY MY WHOLE SEEM ABOUT TRUMA RIGHT IT CHANGES OUR BRAINS AND WE DON'T KNOW IT RIGHT WELL THE SAME CAN BE THE SAME IS OFTEN TRUE OF AMPHETA MEANS USED INAPPROPRIATELY THIT SHIFTS OUR BRAIN AND AND WE DON'T REALIZE IT WE'RE A LITTLE T MORE IMPULSIVE IN OUR DECISION MAKING A LITTLE LESS TRUSTING THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE THINGS THAT IF WE DON'T KNOW IT PRERSENT WILL TO SAY ABOUT OI'M JUSUSING IT TO SIDE AMUSING IT TO WORK MORE THIT'S NOT DO THAT'S NOT WITHOUT IT'S HIGH LEVEL OF RISK WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON CANABUS I'VE SAIT IT MANY TIMES ON THIS POD CAST YOEFORE I'LL SAY YET I I'VE FEEL FORTUNEA I'VE NEVER REALLY BEEN ATTRACTED TO ALCHOL AR DRUGS OF ANY KIND AM IN IN SO MUCH SO THAT IF ALL THE ALCOHOL AND ALL THE MARIWANA AND ALL THE COCANAM FETEMEIAN DISAPPEARED I I WOULDN'T NOTICE ANY CHANGE IN MY LIFE RIGHT IM AND I FEEL LUCKY IN THAT WAY CAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL AT IM AN ATTRACTION TO THESE THINGS AT IS ALMOST A GRAVITATIONAL FORSE FROM THEIR FIRST DRINK IF THEY JUST FEEL I ONCE HEARD IT DESCRIBED IN THIS I I THING WAS A AUGUSTINBOROUGH'S BOOK DRY OR YOUS N ALCOLL HE SAID THAT THE FIRST DRINK HE HAD IT FELT LIKE THIS MAGIC ELICIR THAT THAT MASHED WITH THE PHYSIOLOGY OF HIS BLOOD IN THE MOST SEEMLESS WAY AND AS I WAS REANAS I THOUGHT MY GOODNESS I' FIRST OF ALL THAT'S HAT MUST FOREIGN A EXPERIENCE FOR ME IN TERMS OF ALCOLL AND SECOND ASH THAT MUST BE TERRIBLE AND AND YOU CAN BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU COULD REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY SOME ONE WOULD BE DRAWN TO THAT SO CANABUS NOW IDAYS AS A LEGAL OR DECRIMINALIZED IN MANY ERRAS OF H YOU ASS A LOT PEOPLE SEEM TO YOU SEE ARGUMENT IM IT'S NOT IT'S BETTER THAN DRINKING IM OR THEY ONLY DO IT FOR SLEEP OR ANXIETY MANAGEMENT IM I'M NOT LOOKING TO DEMONIZE OR SUPPORT THAT THE THE CANABUS AR WHANE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT CANABUS FOR ANXIETY MANAGEMENT DEPRESSION AND MAYBE EVEN FORADIATITY FOR THAT MATTER SURE IF I COULD MAKE IT AN ALCOLL COMMENTI A THE NUMBER OF TIMES I'VE SEEN ALCOHOL LIKE HAVING BEEN A GOOD IDEA FOR COPING WITH SOMETHING IT APPROACHES ZERA ITHE THE ALCHLL FOR COPING IS JUST NEVER GOOD AND THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL RISK FACTOR THAT THERE'S CERTAIN GENETIC PROFILES WHERE PEOPLE RESPOND STRONGLY TO ALCO LIKE AS YOU'R SAYING IT'S NOT JUST O TIS A LITTLE BIT OF SHORT TERM RELIEF OF DISTRESS BUT THERE'S AS SO FEW FORIC RESPONSE AND THOSE GENETICS WE KNOW WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE COMPLETELY THEY SEEM TO BE IN NORTHERN EUROPEAN POPULATIONS I MORE PREVALENT AS YOU HAD WEST IN NORTHERN EURO SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT WHERE RISK FACTORS ARE DEMOGRAPHICALLY BUT WE CAN'T PIN POINT THAT FOR ANY ONE PERSON AND THERE'S A TREMENDOUS RISK OF THAT I WENT WHEN A PERSON RESPOND SO STRONGLY TO ALCOLL OR HABITUATES COPING TO ALCHOL I'M CANABUS IS A LITTLE BITOF A DIFFERENT STORY YOU MEAN HOW I HAVE SEEN THAT PLAY OUT AND EN THIS ISN'T COMING FROM ANY EXPERTEES AROUND THE YOUR THE NORPHOMACHOLOGY OTER LIKE HOUSES REALLY WORKING IN THE BRAIN IT COMES FROM AN OBSERVATION THAT WHAT IT SEEMS TO DO IS TO NARROW OR ATTENTIONAL PERSPECTIVE RIGT SO IT'S WHY PEOPLE WILL SAY WHAT THEY WANT ET EITHER WHEN USED CANABUS BEFORE WATCHING A MOVI WITH FRIENDS OR SOMETHING RIGHT AND AND THINK LOOK E I THINK WHY PEOPLE ARE DOING THAT IS BECAUSE A COGNITIV SPECT FROM NARROWS AND THEND INSTEAD OF WORRYING ABOUT THAT THING AT WORK OR THAT RELATIONSHIP IS YOU ONE CAN JUST BE PRESENT RIGHT FOR FOR IT GATES LT OTHER ATTENTIONAL INTRUSIONS RIGT SO IN SOME WAYS I MEAN AVE ABSOLUTELY SEEN IT BE HELPFUL TO PEOPLE MEAN'S BEEN LEGALIZED IN ORGAN A WHICH IS WHERE MY I SPENT A LOT OF MY TIME IN IS IS THAT WHERE ALL OF MY PRACTICE IS BUT AT WHAT I HAVE SEEN IS IT IS AT TIMES HELPFUL SAVE AROUND SLEEP RIGHT BECAUSE A PESON CAN GATE OUT OTHER INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS AND THEY CAN JUST RELAX AND GO TO SLEEP BUT THERE CAN BE ANOTHER SIDE OF THAT TOO THAT AT HIGHER LEVELS OF DISTRESS AT HIGHER LEVELS OF TENSION WHAT IT CAN DO IS NARROW THE FOCUS OF COGNITION TO THE THING THAT IS NEGATIVE I SO SO THE IDEA THAT OO THIS IS A TREATMENT FOR YO DEPRESSION ANXIETY TROMA IS NOT TRUE I CAN IT BE HELPFUL UNDER CERTAIN CERCUMSTANCES IKI THINK THE ANSWER TO THAT IS YET WAN I KNOW THE ANSWER THAT IS YESTERD I'VE SEEN IT PLAY OUT CLINICALLY THAT WAY BUT I CAN ALSO BE HARMFUL TOO SO THERE AGAIN LIKE ANYTHING THAT HAS ANY POWER O POWER TO INFLUENCE OUR BRAINS WE WONE TO BE THOUGHTFUL AND CAREFUL ABOUT IT MEN DO I THINK THAT IT'S SAFER THAN ALICA HOLE YES I MEAN MAYTHICK WE WE SO CLEARLY SEE THAT DOES THAT MEAN OR JUST UNIFORMLY SAFE NO I SO WE WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL OF ANYTHING THAT CAN CHANGE HOW OUR BRAIN IS WORKING AND I THINK THAT INCLUDES CERTAINLY INCLUDES OUCOAND I THINK IT CERTAINLY INCLUDES CANTIBIST TOO I LOVE TO TALK ABOUT PSYCHODELICS AM FOR TWO REASONS A ONE THERE SEEMS TO BE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INTEREST IN PSYCHODELICS AS A THERAPUTIC CLINICAL TOOL I KNOW THERE'S ALSO RECREATIONAL USEONOW JUST PREFACE ALL THIS BY SAYING THAT A MY STANCE IS A WE ABSOLTELY KNOW FOR SURER THAT THESE ARE CONTROL SUBSTANCE AS THERE ILLEGAL TO POSSESS CELL OR USE AN MOST OF THE COUNTRY THERE FEW ERIS WHERE IT A THEYARE DECRIMINALIZED AM AND PSYCHADELIX AS A BROAD CATEGORY OF COURSE AND WE CAN TOUCH ON SOME OF THE DIFFERENT UM DIFFERENT ONES BUT WHEREAS FIVE YEARS OR SO FIVE YEARS AGO OR SO I WAS TRULY AFRAID TO SAY THE WORDS PSYCHODELICS IN ANY KIND OF PUBLIC VENUE THERRE LABORATORIES AT STAMFORD WORKING ON CAN A MEAN SYLICIBE AND MDY M A MOSTLY IN ANIMAL MODELS THERE'S TERRIFIC WORK  GOING ON AT JOHNS HOPKIN SCHOOL MEDICINE AND MATTHEW JOHNSON'S LAB AND OTHERS LOOKING AT THE CLINICAL APPLICATIONS MAINLY OF HIDO SYLICID AN ANALISE D THERE'S THE MAPS TRIALS OF THEM DM A SO NOW IT IYS IT'S SAFE FOR AN ACADEMIC LIKE ME TO SAY THE WORD PSYCHODELICS AND I'M I'D LOVE TO APPROACH THIS QUESTION OF PSYCHODELICS FROM A PLACE OF AF TRUE EXPLORATION AND CURIOSITY BUT WITH THE PREFACE THAT A WE'RE TALKING BOUT THIS AD IN A LEGAL CLINICAL SETTING AM AND THE LEGALITY IS SOMETHING THAT'S NOW IN PROCESS I DON'T THINK IT'S COMPLETED BUT THE THUS MY UNDERSTANDING BUT THERE ARE TRIALS THERE ARE YOU CAN GO TO CLINICAL TRIALS DOT GOV A AND PUT IN M D M A AND YOU'LL SEE A BUNCH OF CLINICAL TRIALS THAT AR ARE HAPPENING IN THE RECRUITING SUBJECTS A SO I THINK IT'S SAFE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION NOW AND I'D LOVE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT PSYCHO D ELICS MAYBE WE COULD START WITH A SYLICIBON AND ELESTE AS AS A BROAD CATEGORY OF DRUGS HAT LEAST MY UNDERSTANDING AS THEY TOUCH ON MAINLY THE CERATONE AND SYSTEM SOME SPECIFIC RECEPTOR ACTIVATION AND MODULATION TEND TO CHANGE NOTIONS OF SPACE AND TIME MA JUST INTERNAL STATE MAY WE WOULD START THERE AND THEYE A VENTURE INTO SOME OF THE OTHER ONE O WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THESE DRUGS FORS THERAPUTEC POTENTIAL ALSO POTENTIAL HAZARDS A ET CETERA THIF WE LOOK AT THE TRUEH PSYCHADELIC SO SYLICIBON AN ELESTY BECAUSE CEDEMY AN AND M DI MA THEY'RE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF MEDICINE ER THESE SURTAN NOVEL TOOLS TO BRING TO BEAR BUT IF WE START WITH SYLICIBE AND ELESTY TRUE SYCHADELICS I THINK WHY IT IS WHY THEY HAVE GAINED SO MUCH MOMENTUM OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IS BECAUSE THE DATA COMING FROM THE THE LABS IN THE ACADEMIC CENTERS  IS SO POWERFULLY POSITIVE AND ITS SOME ONE WHO'S 'M INTERESTED IN ANYTHING THAT'S POTENTIALLY HELPFUL RIGHT AND I WANT TO LEARN AND UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE LOT OF THINGS AT ARPOTENTIALLY HELPFUL YOU KNOW YOU GO AND LOOK AT THE DAT AND YOU SEE THAT THAT'S NOT HELPFUL IT TIT AT'S HARMFUL I THINK WHAT WE HAVE SEEN WITH PSYCHADELICS IS THAT THEY'RE SO HELPFUL RIGHT AND AND THE TRIALS WERE BEARING THAT ON OF COURSE THESE ARE USED IN PROFESSIONAL HANDS AND WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF GUIDANCE AE EXTREMELY POWERFUL TOOLS BUT USED IN THE RIGHT WAY BY BY SOME ONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO UTILIZE THEM IN THE RIGHT SET AND SETTING CAN HAVE AN IMMENSE POSITIVE IMPACT AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT THAT THE THOUGHT IS THERE A CROSS PEOPLE AND MORE AND MORE PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE SANG IT AND TALKING ABOUT IT MEAN THAT WERE IN THE STATE OF ORGAN NOW WHERE WHERE THE THE THOUGHTS WERE MOVING TOWARDS LEGALIZATION OF SYLICIBE AND EARLY IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE AND IT'S PART THE NEW DATA RIGHT AND HOW IT MESHES WITH THE OLDER DATA RIGHT HOW MESURES WITH DATA FROM THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES THAT SHOWED SUCH A STRONG POWERFUL IMPACT OF THESE MEDICINES AND I'VE A WHOLE SET OF THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE AND  JUST THEIR CONJECTURES RIGHT BUT BUT MY READ OF YOU KNOW AS BEST I CAN TRYN T UNDERSTAND THE NARROW SCIENCE AND AND AND THE CLINICAL APPLICABILITY IN THE CHANGES IS OU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AS WE SEE LESS COMMUNICATION O LESS CHATTER IN THE OUTER PARTS OF THE BRAIN WRITING THE OUTER PARTS OF THE QUARTEX AND I THINK THAT AS HUMAN BEINGS WE SOT OF GLORIFY THE PARTS OF THE BRAIN THAT ONLY WE HAVE I MEAN CERTAINLY N MY GROWING UP RIGHT WHAT THAT I LEARN EVEN IF YOU THINK ABOUT GLORING ABOUT THE BRAIN AND HIGH SCHOOL RIGHT AND LEARN THAT LIKE WHAT WORK WERE GREAT AS HUMANS CAUSE WE HAVE LANGUAGE AND OTHER ANIMALS DON'T AND WE CAN USE TOOLS AT LIKE AREN'T WE SO GREAT BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS PART OF THE BRAIN THAT OTHER ANIMALS DON'T AND IT LEFTS US FUNCTION RIGHT LOOK AVE THER'S SOME TRUTH TO THAT RIGHT THAT THAT THAT WE CAN DO THINGS OTHERS CAN'T DO BUT WE WE GET LOST OFTEN IN THE OUTER PARTS OF THE QARTE WHICH I THINK ARE ABOUT SURVIVAL RIGHTS O WE COME BACK TO THE THINGS YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT EARLY ON OF LIKE WHYRE THESE TROMA MECHANISMS IN US RIGHT SIK SO MUCH OF WHAT'S GOING ON ON OUR BRAINS IS ABOUT SURVIVAL AND I THINK LIVING SO TO SPEAK IN THE QARTEC RIGHT IN THE OUTER PART OF THE BRAIN IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FOCUSS ON SURVIVAL SO IF YOU THINK THATS WHERE LANGUAGE S AS PER VISION IS THAT'S WHERE EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IS SO PLANNING AN TACKA TASK EXECUTION SO SO MUCH OF THAT IS ABOUT MAKING OUR WAY IN THE WORLD AROUND US SO WE TEN TO GLORIFY THA THINK WHELL THAT'S IN A SENCE WHERE OUR EXISTENCE IS RIGHT AND I BELIEVE THAT IS NOT TRUE RIGHT A A CAN CAN I SAY THAT FOR SURELY OF COURSE NOW RIGHT BUT MY READ OF TWENTY YEARS OF DOING CLINICAL WORK AND THINKING ABOUT ALL SORTS OF MEDICINES AND AND THINKING ABOUT THE PSYCHADELICS WITH A IN THE LOT OF DEPTH I THINK THAT WHAT THEY DO IS THEY TAKE US OUT OF THE QARTEC RIGHT CAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE RUN INTO THESE PROBLEMS THAT'S WHERE WE BOUNCE THINGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT THE DISTRESS CENTERS DEEP IN OUR BRAIN IN THE BRAIN STEM KIND OF A LY WITH THE OUTER PARTS OF THE QARTEX AND THEY SAY RI WERE INDISTRESS WE WANT TO STAY ALIVE I KNO OFTEN A LOT OF US OF THAT TRAMA THAT MAKES THESE CHANGES IN THE BRAIN  THEN WERE THINKING ALL THE TIME AGAL WOULD I DO IF IF THERE WERE WAR WHAT WOULD I DO IF THEIR CIVIL WORE R SOME ONE BONDS US ALL I DO IF THE IF THE ECONOMY COLLAPSEIS RIGHT WHAT WILL I DO SOMEBODY GET SICK WERE WE'RE THINKING ALL THIS FUTURE PROJECTION THAT IS ALL COMING FROM A PLACE OF FEAR RIHT IS ALL COMING FROM A DESIRE TO THINK ABOUT THINGS AND CONTROL THE FUTURE WITH THIS PART OF THE BRAIN THAT IS SO UNIQUELY HUMAN RIGT AND I THINK WHENE TAKE THE NERVE TRANSMISSION OUT OF THOSE PLACES RIGHT AND LOS SATTERED IN A PART OF THE BRAIN AND SAY THE INSOLER QARTEX RIGHT THE PARTS OF THE BRAIN THAT A SUIT OF IN THE MIDDLE RIGHT WHICH WHICH I THINK I BELIEVE IS WHERE OUR HUMANESS REALLY IS SO THE PSYCHADELICS MAKE THERE BE LESS CHATTER COMMUNICATION THESE OTHER PARTS OF THE BRAIN THEN WE BECOME SEETED IN THE PART OF THE BRAIN THATI I BELIEVE IS MOST ABOUT OUR EXPERIENCE OF TRUE HUMANNESS WHICH IS WHY WHEN YOU READ ABOUT  PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCES AND I'VE HEARD ABOUT THEM PEOPLE TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS RIGHT THAT THEYE THEY UTILIZE TAT THEY TALK WITH MEN SO WHETHER IT'S SOME ONE TELLING ME THER STORY OR IT'S COMING FROM RESEARCH DATA IU KNOW IT'S WHY PEOPLE CAN SO TO SEE WITH CLARITY THAT OH THAT TRAMA T I THINK IS NOT MY FAULT E WE FEEL A SENSE OF COMPASSION FOR OURSELVES WE RELIEVE OURSELVES RELEASE OURSELVES FROM GUILT AND NYOU SINK WHY IS THIS SO HELPFUL TO PEOPLE AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE IT CAN DO WHAT WEARE TRYING TO GET AT IN GOOD THERAPY BUT IT CAN REALLY CATALYZE THAT BI JUST PUTTING A PERSON IN THAT PART OF THE BRAIN THAT CAN SEE IT FOR WHAT IT IS WITHOUT ALL THAT CHATTER IN THE QARTEX ABOUT I GOT I THINK ITS YOUR FATHER YOU W N'T AVOIDED AGAIN AND AND THAT MAKES THE REPETITION COMPULSION HOW DO I THINK A HEAD TO THE NEXT THING THAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN WHAT ELSE BAD MIGHT HAPPEN WE DON'T GET ANYWHERE DOING THAT ND I THINK WHERE WE GET SOMEWHERE IS WHEN WE SEED OURSELVES DEEPER IN THE BRAIN WHICH I THINK WE DO IF IF LIKE DOING REALLY GOOD THERAPYAN WERE YOU KNOW WHE WE'RE IN THE DEEP PRTS OF THE BRAIN BUT THESE THESE PSYCHADELICS THE MEDICINAL VALUE I BELIEVE IS PUTTING US IN THAT PART OF THE BRAIN WHERE PERSON CAN REALLY FIND TRUTH AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT IT'S COME SO FAR IN THESE FEW YEARS BECAUSE II THINK THAT IS VERY CLINICALLY EVIDENT AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE AND MORE THE VALUE OF THAT AND HOW WHAT THE PSYCHADELICS DO CAN BECOME I BELIEVE A HURISTIC FOR UNDERSTANDING LIKE WEIGHT HOWER OUR BRAINS REALLY FUNCTIONING AND WHAT ARE THE PARTS THAT REALLY MATTER TO OUR EXPERIENCE OF BEING HUMAN IT'S THOSE PARTS OF THE BRAIN MY THE DEEP PARTS OF THE BRAIN THE INSOLAR CARTEX AND AND THE AREAS AROUND IT THAT'S AY LIGHT UP WHEN A PERSON HAS AND AN EXPERIENCE OF SPERITUAL ECSTASY OR AN EXPERIENCE OF CONNECTION WITH ANOTHER PERSON RIGHT TO WE WE KIND OF HAVE THESE TELL TALE MARKER IS THAT SOMETHING IS GOING ON THERE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY SPECIAL AND I THINK WE'RE MORE ATTRACTED TO THE OUTER PARTS OF THE BRAIN AND PARKERS ARE EASIER TO STUDY RIGHT MEAN AS YOU NO BETTER THAN I DO WE START ED STUDYING THE BRAIN THROUGH LESION STUDIES RIGHT GAUSE IS EASY TO ER TO SEE IF I PERSNT GOT HUR IN THIS PART OF THE BRAIN OR HAW TO STROKE IN THAT PART OF THE BRAIN WHAT CHANGES SO WE LOOK AT THE CARTEX AUSE ONE IT'S EASIER TO STUDY AND WE TEND TO GLORIFY IT AND I THINK THAT HAS BEEN MISGUIDED M AND I THINK THAT WE'RE LEARNING HOW ABOUT HOW THAT'S BEEN MISGUIDED THROUGH THE STUDY OF THESE NO NOVEL MODALITIES FROM WESTERN PERSPECTIVES WOULD OF COURSE THEY BEEN USE FOR LONG LONG TIME IN OTHER CULTURES BUT NOVEL FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE I'MFASTENING BY THIS IDEA THAT THE IN THESE MIDDLE BRAIN STRUCTURES AYS IS WHERE OUR HUMANITY LIES AND AND AS YOU SAY I ALSO WONDER WHETHER R NOT OTHER ANIMALS EXPERIENCE LIFE MORE FROM THAT ORIENTATION WITH LESS CHATTER WEWE CAN ONLY GUESS WHAT AM YOU KNOW THAT  THE DOG LOVER AND AND A BEING IN THE PRESENCE OF TH ANIMALS THAT SEEM TO JUST BE PRESENT AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THEIR MEDIAN EMBIRNMENT NOT TOO MUCH THERE'S STATION REST I ME SH BUT YOUR TAG ABOUT IS SENSIONS AS IMPORTANT AND EXCENSIONS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT  AND IF WE'RE GOINGTO OVER VALUE SAY LANGUAGE THAND I THINK WE UNDER VALUE SENSIENS RIGHT WHICH IS WHY I THINK WE TEN TO UNDER VALUE ANIMALS RIGHT AND AND THEIR SUFFERING USIN WHE HER NOT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT IT'S RIGHT AND YOU KNOW NOT WRITING ABOUT IT SO O IT'S EASY TO IGNORE AND WE THINK ABOUT GIN THE HUBERUS OF THAT RIGHT THOUGH BECAUSE WE CAN THINK AN TALK AND RIT LIKE WE MUST BE FEELING MORE THAN THEN SPECIES THAT DON'T DO THAT AME AND I THINK III THINK THAT IS SO TRUE AND TH WE'RE GAN TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT SENSIONS AND OTHER SPECIES AND HOW NOW THAT'S AT THE CORE OF EXISTENCE AM AND MY HOPE WOULD BE T AT WE VALUE MORE HUMANS AND ANIMALS RIGHT THROUGH THROUGH THE EVOLUTION OF THAT UNDERSTANDING THE HALLUCINATIONS THAT ACCOMPANY I'M PSYCHODELICS LIKE AELISTY AND SYLICIBON HAVE SUCH AN ATTRACTIVE FORCE TO THEM AS AS A CONCEPT AND AND AS AN EXPERIENCE AM AND SO I THINK MOST OFTEN WHEN PEOPLE HERE HALLUCINAGENS THEY THINK OF IN PSYCHODELICS THEY THINK ABOUT HALUCINATING RIGHT MAX SONS WHY THEY WOULDN' BUT WHAT SO INTERESTING IN ME AS NOTHING IN YOUR ANSWER ABOUT PSYCHODELICS ACYLISIBAN ANELISTY FOKASED ON HALLUCINATIONS PER SA IT WAS MORE ABOUT FEELING STATES ACCESSING A FEELING STATE OR A RELATION TO AN EVENT OR TO A PERSON OR TO ONES SELF MAYBE THEN I I CAUGHT HINTS OF MAYBE EVEN EMPATHY FOR ONE'S SELFE FOR THE FIRST TIME YET NONE OF THE ADI TO DO WITH SEEN UM A SEENG SOUNDS OR OR A HEARING COLLORS AND THE ANOTHER CONICLECHE STATEMENTS ABOUT IM HALLUCINATION SO UM I AM AWARE OF LABORATORIES WANTIT A UNIVERSILY CALIFORNIA DAVIS AND PARTICULAR BUT A FEW OTHERS THAT ARE TRYING TO GENERATE CHEMICAL VARIANCE OF OF OF PSYCHODELICS THAT LACK THE HALLUCINAGENIC PROPERTIES BUT MAINTAIN THESE OTHER PROPERTIES AS THE REPUTIC TOOLS AND AS I SAY THAT I REALIZE THAT I A PEOPLE IN THE PSYCHODELIC COMMUNITY UM I PROBABLY THINKING ALL THAT'S HORRIBLE THAT'S A THE DISMANTLING OF OF THE THE COOR THING BUT THE SIMPLE QUESTION AS DO YOU THINK THE HALLUINATIONS ARE VALUABLE FOR ANYTHING I THINK WE'RE REALLY GETTING INTO THE INTO THE PHILOSOPHICAL RIGHT THE UNTOLOGICAL RIT TIS THI SIM TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BEING I AND I DON'T CLAIM TO KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT I THINK THAT AT TIMES IT SEEMS LIKE THE HALLUCINATIONS HAVE  METAPHORICAL OR A SYMBOLIC AM WAY OF BEING HELPFUL RIGHT BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL COME TO UNDERSTAND THINGS THAT THAT THEY HOLD DEER AND TRUE AFTER THE EXPERIENCE RIGHT THAT THAT OFTEN NOT ALWAYS COME THROUGH THE LENDS OF OF THE HALLUCINATION SO ARE THE HALLUCINATIONS NECESSARY UM ARE THESE HALLUCINATIONS SOMETIMES IMPORTANT SOMETIMES NOT MAY THINK WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT AND I THINK WE WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL OF THE OF SIT OF MYSTERY OF THAT BUT WHAT I THINK IS FASCINATING IS YOU THIN THAT  SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND WHAT THAT THAT MEANS IS BE ONE ASPECT OF THAT IS THAT A PERSON AS EXPERIENCES THOUGHTS CONCEPTIONS OF SELF IN THE WORLD WITH THE SUBSTENCE THAT WITHOUT THE SUBSTANCE THEY KNOW ARE WRONG RIGHT VIAL TALK LAT ENO LOKUID COURAGE RIGHT KNOWK GI FEEL BETTER ABOUT MYSELF AND I FEEL COURAGEOUS THAT'VE HAT A COUPLE OF DRANKS NOW WHEN I I AFTER THAT I FEEL LIKE NORMAL ABOUT MYSELF AND THAT THAT WAS FALSE RIGHT AND AM WE SEE THAT LIKE THAT'S PART OF WHAT SUBSTANCE INTOXICATION MEANS RIGHT BUT WHAT WE SEE WITH THE PSYCHODELIC MEDICINES IS SOMETHING THAT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFERENT RIGHT THAT PEOPLE ARE HAVING EXPERIENCES THAT ARE SO DEE E LINKED FOR MY NORMAL EXPERIENCE OF REALITY AND THEN WHEN THEY COME INTO SENS BACK ON LIIN WITH I WITH IN ENORMAL COGNITIVE WAY THEY REAL AS A WIL NOMAPLYING ALL THOSE MECHANISMS OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND TRUTH AND TO TO THAT AND WHAT WHAT I SEE IS THAT IT'S TRUE AND WIW IT'S TRUE LIKE A MANY WE HAVE TAT ALL THE TIME WHICH TELLS ME HEY SOMETHING DIFFERENT IS GOING ON THERE AND OF COURSE THESE ARE POWERFUL TOOL SO MISUSED THAT VERY BAD THINGS CAN HAPPEN BUT YOU THINK ABOUT THE CLINICAL UTILITY AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT SO MANY PEOPLE CHANGE FOR THE HEALTHIER OR EVEN CHANGE THEIR LIVES AFTER INEXPERIENCE BECAUSE IT SO RESIGNATES IS LIKE O NOW I UNDERSTAND SOMETHING THAT'S TRUE AND IT'S NOLL SOMETHING BAZAAR IS LIKE I WASN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR BEING RATED THAT TIME OR NO I KNOW'M NOT LESS THAN EVEN THOUGH MY SECTUALITY MY GENER IDENTITIES DIFFERENT FROM SOME SILLY BINARY CONCENT R TET TEEPE KIND O CANK OFTEN GET IT AND THEY FEEL DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THEMSELVES AND GUILT AND SHAME ARE IMPACTED SO I THINK WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE THAT THEY ARE POWERFUL ANTI TRAMA MECHANISMS AGAIN USED CLINICALLY IN THE RIGHT HANDS AND AND I THINK THAT WE'RE ALSO DONTO SEE THAT THEIR HERISTIC FOR UNDERSTANDING OR BRAIN THAT GOES AGAINST WHAT I SEE IS SOME OF THE REFLECTSIVE HUBERIS OF WELL THE OUTER PARTS MUST BE THE BEST BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MAKES US HUMAN AND OTHER ANIMALS DON'T HAVE IT AND WE'RE BETTER BECAUSE WE'RE HUMAN A MEANS MAKES A SENSE OU KNOW I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT EMDIAMA A AND ALL PREFACES BY SAYING I WAS A PARTICIPANT I SHOULD TECHNICALLY I'M STILL A PARTICIPANT IN A CLINICAL TRIAL SO I HAVE EXPERIENCE OF DOING IT TWICE ATHE A TRIAL INVOLS THREE SAPRADOSINGS OF THIS UM I WAS RELUCTANT TO DO IT OUTSIDE OF A CLINICAL TRIAL MOST BECAUSE I WAS A AWARE THERE CAN BE SOME CARDIAC OF FACTS AND I LIKE THE ITHE OTHERE BE A CLINITION ON HAND AND AM I'LL JUST SAY THAT I FOUND THE EXPERIENCES TO BE A PROFOUND AM BENEFICIAL AND VERY DIFFERENT FROM ONE AM ONE SESSION TO THE NEXT THE FIRST ONE A FELT AM IT A WHOLE COLLECTION OF OF IDEAS AND RELATIONOL THINGS CAME UP THAT FELT VERY POWERFUL AND TRANSFORMITIVE AND I I DO THINK THAT I LEARNED THERE I EXPORTED A NUMBER OF THINGS MY PARTICULAR EXPERIENCEIS IN RELEVANT HERE BUT THE SECOND TIME I EXPECTED IT TO BE THE SAME WAY AND IT WAS VERY MELLOW AND RELAXING AND WAS IT WAS DEEPLY TIED TO KIND OF A NOTIONS OF ACCEPTANCE SO THERE WEREN'T ALL THESE REVELATIONS AND A WIL NEW INSIHTS IT WAS VERY MUCH ABOUT SO GROUNDING INTO AA KIND OF A COLMER STATE SO I HAVE THE THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF A BENEFITING FROM THESE IN WAYS I THINK STILL BENEFIT ME AM AND WAS VERY STRUCK BY THE POWER OF EMDIAMA AND MY VERY CRUDE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHARMACOLOGY IN THE STATE THAT IS BEING UNDER EMDYAMAZE THAT ITCOURAGES ARE INCREASES DOPLOMANURGIC TRANSMISSION BUT ALSO SERETONERGIN TRANSMISSION WHICH IS TO MINE O UNCH A KIND OF A RARE STATE FOR THE BRAIN TO BE IN THEN SEPPICALLY IT'S MORE OF A SEE SAOF DOPEN MENURGIC DRIVE TOWARDS EXTERNAL GOALS WHEN MORE SERATONERGIC DRIVE TOWARDS YOU KNOW AM MORE PLACIDY TY R COMFORT WITH WHAT ONE ALREADY HAS AND SO WITH BOTH THOSE SYSTEMS AMPLIFIED I THE ONLY WAY I CAN DESCRIBED IT SUBJECTIVELY IS THAT T EVERYTHNG SORT OF FUNNEL BACK IN AND IT WAS ALMOST LIKE UM A PURSUIT OF INNER LANDSCAPE AAND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE IN THE CONTECTS OF OF DOING THIS WITH SOMEBODY ELSE ALSO TAKING EM DIA MAN IAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT'S LIKE UM THAT'S MY REPORT OF THE EXPERIENCE I KNOW THAT THESE BURNS CAN BARY WHAT IT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE THE CHAMISTRY AND THE WHAT WHAT SORTS OF STATES DO YOU THINK EMDIAMAIS CREATING UM THAT CAN A EXPLAIN WHY IT'S A USEFUL THERAPEUTIC TOOL IN SOME CASES AND AN WHAT SORTS OF CASES THOSE MIGHT BE SOU'RE YOURE THE DECLEVER THINK PART OF WHAT WE'RE STARTING WITH IS IS THAT THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE PSYCHADELICS RIGHT WHICH ARE SEETING OUR CONSCIOUSNESS IN THESE DEEP CENTERS OF THE BRAIN RIGHT WHERE'S WHAT EMPD MA IS DOING IS SORT OF FLOODING WITH POSITIVE NER TRANSMITTERS RIGHT IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE BRAIN AND I THINK WHAT THAT CREATES IS A GREATER TREMISSIVENESS INSIDE TO ENTERTAIN OR PROACH DIFFERENT THINGS RIGHT SO THE SO I THINK WHERE WE SEE ITS TREMEND MY READOF THE DATA IS AROUND POTENTIALLY AND AND WERE SEEING IN SOME OF THE TRIALS RI TREMENDOUS BENEFIT FOR TRAMA RIGHT NYO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER HOW THIS RRFLECTIVE GUILT SHAME HYPER VIGILANCE AVOIDANCE RIGHT AND WHEN THESE SYSTEMS ARE ARE FLOODED WITH THESE NEAR TRANSMITTERS IT'S MORE PERMISSIVE JUS THINK ABOUT THAT RIGHTIN TO THINK ABOUT THAT WITHOUT AGAIN ALL THE CHATTER OF THAT YOUR FAULT OR YOU NEVER GING TO GET ANYWHERE BECAUSE OF THAT OR YOU KNOW WIT THAT MEANS OR RIA THAT THE CCATICA WAY AND THEN WE CAN THINK ABOUT IT IN A WAY IT ISN'T THROUGH THE LENDS OF FEAR RIGHT AND I THINK THAT'S THE POWER THERE IS THAT  IT'S PERMISSIVE OF APPROACHING SOMETHING CONTEMPLATING SOMETHING UM YOU KNOW A DIFFER A NOVELTY WOU SOWTABOUT A D NOVO APPROACH AND I THINK THAT'S ALSO WHY THE EXPERIENCE CONVARY BECAUSE YOU COULD ALSO SEE HOW IF YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING RIGHT SO THERE'S NOT A CLINICAL GUIDANCE TO IT YOU COULD YOU COULD BE IN A STATE WHELE I HAD JUST FEEL GOOD RIGHT IN I'M THINKING ABOUT GOOD THINGS AND LI THAT CAN FEEL GOOD RIGHT BUT IT BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY PROBLEM SOLVING RIGHT SO THE CLINICAL GUIDANCE AYS IT LET'S TAKE THAT STATE AND DO SOMETHING WITH IT RIGHT LET'S IT NOW THAT TERE IN THE STATE LET'S HATE LET'S MAKE HABLE THE SUN IS DINING REGORY IN A STATE WHERE WE CAN LOOK AT THINGS THAT ARE TRAMATIC RIGHT WE CAN APPROACH THEM FROM A DENOOF A PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK IT'S PART I THINK THAT EXPLAINS WLA YOU HAD THESE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES FROM ONE TO THE OTHER BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN IS JUST IN A STATE THAT'S CONDUCIVE TO SOMETHING RIGHT BUT IF THERE'S NOT THAT THE THE MECHANISM TO HAVE THAT THING HAPPENED LIKE CONDUCIVE TO SOMETHING FERYPEUTIC THEN YOU MIGHT GO THERE ON YOUR OWN OR YOU MIGHT JUST BE IN A STATE RE OF A SENSE OF WELL BEING AND AND YOU SIT WITH IT WHICH SORT OF SEEMS LIKE A WASTE TO ME ANDAND THIS IS WHAT I TELL PEOPLE WHEN THEY ASK ABOUT EMDY AM A IS IT I SAID AT LEAST FROM MY EXPERIENCE THAT THAT THE POTENTIAL HAZARD THERE IS THAT IN THAT VERY HIGH DOPE OMAN URGIC SERT AN URGIC STATE A THERE WERE MOMENTS WHERE I FELT LIKE I COULD GET EXCITED ABOUT ANY ONE SPECIFIC CONCEPT THAT I MIGHT EVEN JUST THINK ABOUT FOR INSTANCE A YOU KNOW WATER AND HOW NOURISHING IT IS AND REALLY JUST GO DOWN THE PATH OF WATER IN THE WORLD AND ALL THE WATER AND D YOU CAN YOU KNOW YOU'REN'N A AA STATE THAT IS VERY PRONE TO SUGGESTION YES INTERNAL SUGGESTION AND SO THE GUIDANCE TURNED OUT THAT GUIDANCE FROM THE CLINITION TURNED OUT TO BE IMMENSELY VALUABLE IN ALLOWING ME TO GO INTO MY OWN HEADS FOR A BITS OF TIME BUT THEN ALSO TO RESURFACE IN AND SHARER AN EXCHANGED IN A WAY THAT TO I'M TRYING REALLY GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT THAT WAS USEFUL AN THAT I COULD EXPORT BECAUSE IF COURSE WATER IS WONDERFUL BUT I'M NOT REALLY INTERESTING GROWING MY RELATIONSHIP TO WATER A AND I REALLY THOUGHT I CAN I COULD UNDERSTAND FOR THT I NEVER WENT TO RAVES OR ANYTHING GROWING UP AND EVER DID EMDY I MAY RECREATIONALLY BUT I I UNDERSTOOD FOR THE FIRST TIME HOW PEOPLE COULD GET REALLY ATTACHED TO AN ENVIRONMENT AND FEEL CONNECTED TO THINGS BECAUSE I THINK WITH LL THAT CARITONIN YOU JUST FEEL CONNECTED TO EVERYTHING AROUND YOU SO I I THINK IT'S IT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE THE'RE ANAND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE OF THE CLENICAL USE OF EMDYI MAY LOOKS LIKE BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT WHOEVER SHING ABOUT I'M GUIDING THESE SESTIONS IS REALLY THINKING  CAREFULLY ALSO ABOUT ENVOLVING THE PRACTICE TO HELP PEOPLE REALLY MOVE THROUGH IN A SEQUENCHAY SO THEY CAN LEAVE WITH SOMETHING VALUABLE YES ONE HUNDRED PER CENT AND ONE HUNDRED PERCENT THESE ARE SUCH POWERFUL TOOLS AND IF THEY'RE POWERFUL TOOLS WERE USING THAND WITHOUT RESPECT FOR THAT RIGHT WITHOUT CLINICAL GUIDANCE WE INCUR RISK IMENT YOU GETTING OF ABSESS WITH WATER WHILE ON A PROBABLY ISN'T IN O HURT YOU RIGHT BUT IF SOMEONE IS OUT YOU USING IT IS AROUND OTHER PEOPLE WHAT ONE CAN FEEL POSITIVELY ABOUT O BECOMES TO TO OBSESSED AND ASSURE TURN ABOUT CAN BE VERY COUNTER PRODUCTIVE OR THER CAN BE A LOT OF RISK TO THAT SO I THINK IT T IT IT ANCHORS BACK TO THESE ARE VERY POWERFUL TOOLS WERE COMING TO UNDERSTAND THEM MUCH MUCH MORE AND WE'RE COMING TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE IMMENSE POTENTIAL TO BE HELPFUL TUS BUT I THINK AND HOPE THAT THAT ONLY ALSO INCREASES OUR RESPECT FOR THOSE MOTALITIES AND WHAT CAN COME WHAT NEGATIVE CAN HAPPEN IF WE'RE IF WE'RE NOT RESPECTFUL THIS CAN BE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE WHERE ALL OF THIS GOS IN THE NEXT F YEAR IS NOT JUST IN OREGON BUT ELSEWHERE IT'S A ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IT'S HAPPENING IT SEEMS TO HAVE A MOMENTUM THAT IS NOT GOING TO STOP SO I'M VERY EXCITING AREA I TO BE SURE LEGORY I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT LANGUAGE I'M IN YOUR BOOK YOU TALK ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE USE OF LANGUAGE AROUND TRAMA IT MAY BE PROBLEM SOLVING AN PROBLEM DESCRIBING IN GENERAL YE UM AT ONE EXTREME YOU HEAR THAT U YOUR BRAIN IN YOUR BODY HEAR EVERY WORD YOU SAY AND UM YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO BE SO CAREFUL WITH LANGUAGE UM AND THAT I SHAULDY FRIGHTEN ME FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS CAUSE I WOULD HEAR THAT I THOUGHT GOSH IF I JUST THINK THAT SOMETHING IS BAD NOW IT'S GOIN TO HURT ME WORSE WHICH HIMSELF IS PART OF THAT WHOLE E PACKING DOWN OF AN ISSUE U VERY HARD TO AVOID THOUGHTS UM WITHOUT DISTRACTION UM A SO THAT'S ONE EXTREME ON THE OTHER HAND YOU KNOW I I CAN SAY UM I CAN TELL SOMEBODY I LOVE THEM U WITH A TONE OF HATRED I CAN TELL SOMEBODY I HATE THEM WITH A TONE OF LOVE UM SO HOW SHAULL WE THINK ABOUT LANGUAGE IN PARSING TRAMA AND IN YOUR BOOK YOU TALK ABOUT EM YOU GIVE SOME CAUTIONARY NOTES ABOUT UM TALKING ABOUT DEPRESSION TRAMA AND PTST IN TERMS THAT THAT MIGHT DIMINISH THEIR REAL UM SEVERITY IN SOME CASES AND AN I WAS REALLY STRUCK BY THAT S MAY YOU JUST TOUCH ON YOU KNOW HOW SHOULD WE TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS IN A WAY THAT UM DOESN'T DIMINISH THEM FOR OURSELVES OR FOR OTHER PEOPLE AND UM AT THE SAME TIME HONORIS THE FACT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF TRAMA OUT THERE AND U THERE'S A LOT OF DEPRESSION OUT THERE AND AND WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT YE I THINK THIS A VERY COMPLICATED AND MANY WAYS CONVOLLUTED TOPIC TAT I THINK IT IT'S WONDERFUL THAT WE HAVE LANGUAGE BUT BOY LANGUAGE LEADS US A STRAY OFTEN TOO HE THINK ABOUT HOW WE HOW PEOPLE DEFINE WORDS LIKE WHAT WHAT SOME ONE SAYS A WORD WAS IT DOESNAT PERTHEN KNOW WHAT THAT WORD MEANS AND WHAT NEW ANTS ARE THEY TAKING FROM IT THAT WE SAIVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHAT WE'RE SAYING IN WHAT WE'RE COMMUNICATING AND I THINK THIS DOESN'T MEAN BECAUSE IR THERE'S A SIT OF PHENOMENON NOW WERE WERE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO CONTROL LANGUAGE I THINK TO MUCH LIKE YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING THAT SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT FIND HURTFULLY IF TO REFER TO PEOPLE IN WAYS THEY CHOOSE TO BE REFERRED TO EVEN IF THOSE ARE WAYS THAT OTHERS DON'T UNDERSTAND OR WAYS THEY THEMSELVES HAVE DECIDED WERE WAYS THAT MIGHT BEPSYCHOLOGICALLY OR CLINICALLY UNHELPFUL SO I THINK THE OVER CONTROL OF LANGUAGE IS NOT GOOD BUT I THINK THIS SPECIFICITY OF LANGUAGE OF WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO SAY HOW ARE WE DEFINDING IT EVEN THE WORD TRAMA WHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TROMISE WE WANTED TO FIND WHAT THAT MEANS RIGHT IT DOESN'T JUST MEAN LIKE ANYTHING KIND OF NEGATIVE RIGHT BECAUSE TIN THAT DELUDES IT DOWN TO MEANING NOTHING RIGHT IT ALSO DOESN'T JUST MEAN I KNOW UM INJURY IN COMBAT RIGHTLY WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT IS SO I THINK ANCHORING IT TO SOMETHING THAT RISES TO THE MAGNITUDE OF OVERWHELMING OUR COPING SKILLS AND CHANGING US LIKE THEN AT LEAST I DEFINE IT THAT WAY AND I CAN COMMUNICATE THAT TO YOU AND WE CAN AN UNDERSTAND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT I THINK THAT ANOTHER ASPECT OF LANGUAGE WHILE AGAIN WE NEED THIS MIDDLE GROUND AND I DON'T THINK THAT IT IS OC FOR THE OVER CONTROL OF LANGUAGE TO SHUT DOWN EXPRESSION BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOU KNOW HOW WWE'RE SO MUCH LESS DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER THROUGH S OCIAL MEDIA AND THINK SOCIAL MEEDING CAN DO VERY VERY GOOD THINGS IS HOPEFULLY WE'RE DOING NOW RIGHT BUT IT CAN ALSO BE USED TO HARM PEOPLE FROM A DISTANCE RIGHT AND HOW MUCH HATEFULNESS IS THERE OUT THERE THA THINK COMES FROM ANGER AND FRUSTRATION IN PEOPLE GOND BACK TO TROMA RIGHT FOR PEOPLE JUST WANT TO BE ANGRY AND IT'S NOT REALLY ISSUES OF THEIR TALKING ABOUT BUT THEN THERE'S A TARGET OF THAT ANGER AND AND YOU NO PEOPLE FEEL BELEAGERED BY THAT AND THTHE WORDS HAT PEOPLE USE SOMETIMES ARE SO AWFUL THAT SOME ONE READING THAT LOOK IF YOU'RE IN THE DEMOGRAPHIC IT'S BEING TARGETED RIGHT IN YOUR READING THAT MEAND HOW'S A PERSON NOT FEEL YOU NOT FEEL AM BE SET UPON VUNERABLE RIGHT AND THEN I THINK THAT ALSO FUELS YOU KNOW THINGS THAT WE JUST HAD THIS IS TERRIBLE SHOOTING IN BUFFALO RIGHT LEGOUSTY HATE MOTIVATED RIGHT AND I THINK THAT BECAUSE THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE BECOMES VERY REAL TO PEOPLE WHO MAY TAKE IT IN IT FUELS THEIR HATE AND THEN THEY DO SOMETHING TO ENACT IT WHICH OF COURSE CREATES GREATER FEELING VONT FEAR AND VONERABILITY AND I THINK THERE WAS SOME CIVILITY AND DECORUM THAT WAS IN OUR WORLD NOT THAT LONG AGO RIGHT I MEAN YOM IN MY EARLY FIFTIES OM NOT THAT OLD RIGHT BUT I REMEMBER A TIME WHEN WHEN IN POLITICAL DISCOURSE THAY PEOPLE WERE CIVIL TO ONE ANOTHER RIGHT NOW SO MUCH AND I'S NOT ALL OF IT RIGHT BUT THERE'S AN ACCEPTANCE OF THINGS THAT ARE JUST BOMBASTIC RIGHT THASE THAT IT'S A CIRCUS SIDE SHOW SOMETIMES OF OF YOUR PEOPLE BEING JUST ANGRY AND AGGRESSIVE AND AND IT'S NOT REALLY LINK TO ANYTHING ATHOTS A LEGEDLY LINK TO SOMETHING BUT AND OTHER PEOPLE'S ANGER CAN ATTACH TO IT AND IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT IT'S ABOUT BUT IT'S ABOUT ALYING WITH THE ANGER AND AND I THINK THAT THERE IS SO MUCH DAMAGE THAT COMES FROM THAT AND AND I THINK YOU SHOULD WE HAVE SHOULD IT BE OKE THAT PEOPLE SOMETIMES ARE TALKING COMMUNICATING USING LANGUAGE IN WAYS THAT WOULD LIKE GET US SUSPENDED FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL RIGHT WAYS I DON'T WANT MY EIGHT YEAR OLD TO SEE MEAN IS THAT REALLY OKE OR DOI NY TO TAKE A STAND FOR RATIONAL USE OF LANGUAGE I DON'T WANT MY USE OF LANGUAGE TO BE OVER CONTROL BY SOME ONE WHO THINKS THEY SOID UNDERSTAND BETTER THAN THE REST OF US HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH US IC I DON'T WANT THAT WHATS STERATYPICALLY A SORT OF A IDEA OF THE LEFT SA RIGHT AT LEAST IN OUR SOCIETY BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT LANGUAGE CAN BE SO ANGRY AND SO AGGRESSIVE THAT IT IS PERPETUATING OR SPREADING VONEABILITY AND THAT IT FACILITATES TROMUM AND AND I THINK WE COULD SET STANDARS AS A SOCIETY FOR WE SAY LOOK I DON'T I DON'T WANT ANYBODY IN POWER WHOS WHO'S GING TO BEHAVE THAT WAY RIGHT I DON'T CARE IF THEIR WHOL AGENDI IS LIKE MAKE PALCONTI'S LIFE BETTER I'M SO MUCH IN VOTE FOR YOU RIGHT IF YOU'RE BEHAVING TOWARDS OTHERS IN A WAY THAT'S DENEGRATING YOU'R BEHAVING IN A WAY THAT I FEEL IS I SENS ASHAMED OF RIGHT AND AND I FEEL THAT A LOTER I SEE THE POLITICS YOU I SEE THINGS PLAY OUTS NOT ALWAYS POLITICAL OF COURSE NOT ALWAYS POL BUT I SEE THINGS PLAY OUT I THINK O MY GOSH I FEEL EMBARRASS LIKE WE WERE WERE SOMEHOW WHO CAME WITH THIS WHIT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH SIDE OF THE POLITICAL SPECT FROM ITS COMING TO AND I THINK THAT'S AN INDICATOR THAT WHAT WERE DOING IS REALLY HURTFUL T US PEOPLE BECOME MORE ANGRY THEY ATTACHED TO THE ANGER IM PEOPLE FEEL MORE BELEGER THERE'S MORE DIVISIONS BETWEEN US HAND IT SEEMS MORE AND MORE LIKE WHAL WE CAN ONLY REALLY IDENTIFY WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST LIKE US LIKE WHAT AT REALLY MEAN MEN TH THE DIVISIONS THAT IT CREATES BETWEEN US AND AND THAT YOU NOW THAT PROMOTES SO MANY NEGATIVE THINGS RIDIO MEN THING BYT WAYS IN WHICH IT PROMOTES WHITE SUPREMACY RA JUS ONE EXAMPLE I AND WEVE SEEN THAT PLAY OUT THAT THIS IS REALLY BAD FOR US AND WE'VE GOT A LOOK AT THAT AND IF WE DON'T LOOK AT THAT I DON'T THINKAS I SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN LIKE SOMETHING IS HAPPENING IGHIT'S HAPPENING NOW AND 'M I IT REALLY TO MY MIND IT REALLY SHEEPS DOWN INTO THE SOIL OF EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ON ALL SIDES YES PEOPLE ARE ACTIVATED PEOPLE ARE ARE UPSET ABOUT ONE THING WOR THE OTHER I LI NOT NO ONE IS A MUN FROM UPSET REGARDLESS OF POLITICAL OFFILIATION AND I EVERYBODY SEEMS TO BE UPSET NOWADAYS AND I IM AS I WAS HEARING YOU TALK ABOUT THIS I I FEEL LOT OF RESIDENCE WITH WHAT WHAT YOU SAID AND I ALSO HOPING YOU RUN FOR OFFICE  OF THE GIF THE GUMPTION FOR THAT BUT THAT BUT THANK YOU  WEL EM TE WONDERFUL IYOU I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT A CONCEPT OF TAKING CARE OF ONESELF THIS COMES UP IN THE BOOK YEIM THIS IS ONLY WE TALK A LOT ABOUT ON THIS PODCAST I MEAN I THINK PEOPLE HAVE HEARD ME BLAB ENDLESSLY AN OL  PROBABLY GO INTO THE GRAVE TELLING PEOPLE TO GET SUNLIGHT IN THEIR EYES WHEN THEY CAN AND TO TRY AND GET PROPER SLEEP AN TO HAVE A FEW TOOLS FOR IM REDUCING THEIR ANXIETY IN REAL TIME AND AND ON AND ON AND ON I YOU KNOW WE HEAR ABOUT THIS CONCEPT OF TAKING CARE OF ONESELF AND AND I THINK A AT A SURFLEVEL IM IT CAN SOUND A LITTLE BIT LIKE YOU KNOW O TAKE CARE  TAKE CARE TAKE GOOD CARE YOU KNOW WE IM BUT TO ME IT'S A DEEP AND POWERFUL CONCEST AND I WAS VERY UM HAPPY TO SEE IT IN YOUR BOOK AND ALSO TO LEARN A LOT OF UM OF IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THAT REALLY LOOKS LIKE IM BECAUSE WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY IS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF CONSIDERING WHETHER NOT THEY HAVE TRAMA ORS IN THE DEEP STAGES OF WORKING THAT THROUGH OR AS MADE IT THROUGH THE TUNNEL SOME DISTANCE TAKING ONE CARE OF ONESELF AS AN ON GOING PROCESS IM I'D LEVE FOU TO JUST DESCRIBE WHAT TAKING CARE OF ONESELF MEANS TO YOU AS A CLINITION AND OF COURSE THE PRACTICEIS IN THINGS THAT YOU ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DO BUT BUT HOW WISH HOW SHALL WE THINK ABOUT TAKING CARE OF ONESELF BECAUSE ON ONE EXTREME WEU CAN IMAGINE A MISSAGHES RETREATS VACATIONS AND UM I SHEFTS FOR HIRER THAT TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING FOR OURSELVES I'M AND ON THE OTHER EXTREME YOU COULD SAY UM YOU KNOW LEANING IN TO LIFE IN A WAY THAT YOURE PAYING ATTENTION TO SMALL THINGS WHILE WORKING VERY VERY HARD I'M SO IT'S SUCH A BIG CONCEPT BUT HO HOW DO YOU THING ABOUT TAKING CARE OF ONESELF HOW SHOULD I TAKE CARE JYSELF HOW SHOULD PEOPLE TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES SUR I SEE HERE WHAT I THINK IT'S A VERY FASCINATING DICOTOMY RIGHT THAT IN SOME WAYS I THINK OF HOW COMPLEX OUR BRAINS ARE RIGHT HOW COMPLEX ARE PSYCHES ARE UNCONSCIOUS MINDS ARE THERE' SO MUCH COMPLEXITY THERE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND PSYCHOLOGICAL CONCEPTS THAT ARE CON SISTENT WITH HEALTH ARE OFTEN VERY SIMPLE RIGHT WISH I WISH I DON'T MEAN LIGHT RIGHT WET BUT BUT SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD RIGHT AND AN THING SELF CARE IS ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THEM I MEAN HOW MUCH IS TALK ABOUT HOW TO TAKE CARE OF ONESELF THAT JUST SKIPS OVER THE BASICS THAT ARE NECESSARY IS A BUILDING BLOCK FOR ALL ELSE OR T DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY CHAPS ARE VACATIONS OR WHATEVER A PERSON HAS IF THE BASICS OF SELF CAREOARAND SQUARED AWAY AND IT'S NOT A LIKE CONCEPT TO SAY LIK LOOK ARE YOU SLEEPING ENOUGH RIGHT ARE YOU EATING WELL ARE YOU GETTING NATURAL LIGFT ARE YOU INTERACTING WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE GOOD TO INTERACT WITH RIGHT ARE YOU EXCEPTING NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS IN YOUR LIFE ARE YOU LIVING IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL O KA OR NOT THITHER VERY VERY BASIC PREMISES BUT SO OFTEN WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THEM AT ALL RIGHT WERE NOT LOOKING AT THEM AT ALL BECAUSE WE TEND TO SKIP OVER THEM AND WE TEND TO SKIP OVER THEM EITHER BECAUSE AGAIN IN SOME AUTOMATIC WAY THAT SOMETIMES AS TROMA DRIVEN OORE NUCK IN TA LOOK AT THAT RIGHT AND OFTEN NOT TAKING CARE OF OURSELVES CAN HAVE THE PUNISHMENT DISTRACTION A N RAITHERES SO MUCH THAT CAN COME INTO THAT OR OUR SENSE OF POWER IS IS TIE TO NOT TAKING CARE OF OURSELVES ME NI AN EXAMPLEIS I TEND TO FOR WHATEVER REASON DO REASONABLY WELL I'M WITH VERY POOR SELF CARE RIGHT AND LIKE THAT WAS VERY ADAPT IF WHEN I WAS INTOMEDICAL TRAINING INI I GO I CAN I CAN EAT A LOFT TO DAY I CAN NAUGHTY RIGHT I CAN SLEEP TWO HOURS I CAN SLEEP ADE RIGHT I MEAN OVER ALL THAT'S NOT GOOD AND IT HASN'T BEEN GOOD FOR ME AS I'VE AGED BUT THEN I I REALIZE SOM BOLOOK I'M DOING ALL THESE THINGS THAT MAKE MYSELF HEALTHIER BUT LIKE WHAT I IGNORE THAT RIGHT AND WHY AM I IGNORING THAT WAS A CUC WHY AM I IGNORING IT BECAUSE SOMEWHERE INSIDE OF ME IS IT WAS AND STILL TO SOME EXTENT IS THIS IDEA THAT MY ABILITY TO BE REALLY FUNCTIONOL RIGHT TO GENERATE SUCCESS IN THE WORLD AROUND ME IS TIE TO MY ABILITY TO DO THAT RIGHT THAT ALL FI BUT IF I STOP DOING THAT AN OW LIKE IM MEETING AND SLEEPING REGULARLY THAN  CAN TO LOSE SOME EDGE AND SO SO N EVEN I THINK ABOUT US ALL THE TIME BUT IAVE A REALIZE HAY I'M ALSO I'M NOT DOING IT INSIDE YOU KNOW AND AND I THINK IT'S REALLY

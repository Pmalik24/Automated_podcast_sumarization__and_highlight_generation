LIVE EVENT IN LOS ANGELISTS WHAT OCCURS IN THE MINE BODY WHEN YOU HAVE EIGHTY EIGH T O THERWAYS TO ADDRESS IT WITHOUT MEDICATION UM THANK YOU FOR THIS QUESTION SO ATTENTION DEFIS AT HEYPERACTIVITY DISORDER USED TO BE CALLED EH D D UM THE HEYPRACTIVITY PART IS A LITTLE MISLEEDING AND AGAIN I'M NOT A CLINITION HERE UM HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW WORKS FOR SOME PEOPLE AND YET THEYRE ALWAYS GOING TO BE SIDE EFFECTSIV ANY KIND OF CHEMICAL UM MANIPULATION WHICH IS AT WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE KIDS AND ADULTS WITH EGHTY EIGHT T ASHLY HAVE A TREMENDOUSCAPACITY TO FOCUS IF THEY LIKE WITH THEYR FOCUSSING ON YOU TAKE A KID WITH EIGHTY TI CAN'T FOCUS AND YOU GIVE THEM THEIR FAVORITE VIDIOGAME AND THERE ARE A LAZER THE THRESHOLD TO ACCESS THE DOPAMING SYSTEM IS HIGHER AND DOBAMIN HAS THIS INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO FOCUS THE BRAIN ANOTHER ASPECTS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM YOU DON'T CERTAINLY IF PEOPLE REQUIRE MEDICATION I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU TO STOP TAKING THAT MEDICATION BUT THE FOCUS TRAINING EXERCISES THAT HAVE BEEN EXPLORED MAINLY IN CHINA BUT THEYRE TRYING TO BE EXPLORED IN OVER HERE AS WELL DO SEEM TO BE OF BENEFIT AND THESE ARE AS THEY SOUND THEY USE THEM IN SCHOOLS IN CHINA NOW WHICH ARE LITERALLY VISUAL FOCUS EXERCISES YOU'R MENTAL FOCUS THAT IS YOUR ABILITY TO FOCUS ON IN COGNIVELY FOLLOWS YOUR VISUAL FOCUS AND OF COURSE YOUR STRESS WILL ANCHOR YOUR YOUTHE CENTULY PUT YOU IN A SOTUSTRAW FIEW OF THE WORLD SO YES THERE ARE A NON  MEDICATION BASE TREATMENTS BY MEDICATION ON ASSUMING YOU MEAN PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION THERE OF COURSE SUPPLEMENT BASE MEDICATIONS THAT WILL INCREASE DOPAMIN MAINLY ALTIRASINE UM AGAIN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT TH CAREFULLY ABOUT BEFORE YOU START TAMPERING WITH YOU'RE DOPAMING SYSTEM BUT IT IS THE THE ELTIRASINE IS THE PRECURS OR TO DOPAMI SO WILL RAISE YOUR DOPAMIN LEVELS BUT I BELIEVE AND YOU'LL HEAR ME SAY THIS AS MANY TIMES AS NECESSARY THAT ONE SHOULD IF YOU CAN RELY ON BEHAVIORAL TOOLS FIRST THEN OF COURSE SLEEP IN NUTRITIONIS TARE PREREQUISITE AGAIN FOR ALL MENTAL HALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH PERFORMACE YOU SIMPLY CAN'T NEGLECT THOSE AND THEN AND ONLY THEN UM IF THOSE ALL OF THAT IS INTO WORKING TO RELY ON SUPPLEENT BASE TOOLS OR ON UM PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION SO IT'S CLEAR THAT VIVE ANTS ATER ALL RIDDLIN ET CETERA WORK FRADIAEE BUT OF SOME PEOPLE CHOUSE TO RELY ON MORE SUBTLE FORMS OF PARMOCOLOGIC MANIPULATION LIKE ELTIRACINE AND THIS FOCUSING EXERCISE A ESSENTIALLY CONSISTS OF SPENDING ONE TO THREE MINUTES TRYING TO MAINTAIN VISUAL FOCUS AND YES YOU ARE ALLOWED TO BLINK I DON'T KNOW WHY WE WE TEND TO STERIT SOMETHING WE DON'T BLINK BUT OM DON'TLAY YOUR EYES DRY OUT AND THAT CAN INCREASE YOUR ABILITY TO FOCUS COGNITIVELY AND IT WORKS UM AND KEEP IN MIND THAT FOCUSING ALWAYS INVOLVES A REFOCUSING WE COVERED A BEAUTIFUL DATA SET NOT COLLECTED BY MY LAB BY WENDY SIZUKI'S LABIT AND WHY YOU THAT IT ROUGHLY TEN MINUTE IT'S ASHL THIRTEEN MINUTE A DY MEDITATION OF THE SORT WHERE YOU JUST FOCUS ON YOUR BREATHING HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE FOCUS SIGNIFICANTLY WHY DON'T WE HEARE ABOUT THIS MORE WELE SHE'S NOW DEANE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES AND WHY YOU AND ALL THE STUDENTS ARE HEARING ABOUT IT HOPEFLY THEY'R DOING IT BUT IT TAKES A LOBIT OF DISCIPLINE FOR SOME REASON TEN MINUTE A TIGPT MEDICATION IS SOMETHING THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE FOLLOW CONSISTENTLY BUT IF YOURE OOKING FOR NON MEDICATION BASE TREATMENTS RADIAGE TE ORDYOUR SOMEBODY WHO JUST STRUGGLES WITH FOCUS THE FOCUSING EXERCISE OR THE MEDITATION I JUST DESCRIBED I CAN BE VERY USEFUL SO SAY THE DATA YE THINKS FOR BRING UP SPACETIME BRIDGING OR PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH WHAT SPACETIME BRIDGINAS I HAVEN'T TALKED A LOT ABOUT IT OCAT THIS IS A THANKS FOR BRINGING THAT UP A WE A SHL HAVE AN EPISODE ON MEDITATION COMING UP SOON WHERE I COVER IT AND I TALKED ABOUT IT LONG AGO AND THEN I KIND OF ABANDONED IT BECAUS UM WELL WE WANTED MORE DATA AND AND IT'S A PRETTY INTERESTING TECHNIQUE YOU NO IF YOU THINK ABOUT NOT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AN VISION IN PARTICULAR BUT IF YOU'RE NOT A SIGHTED PERSONIN YOU'R LOW VISION OR NO VISION YOU COULD DO THIS WITH YOUR HEARING BUT I MENASSUME MOST PEOPLE HERE ARE SITED UM IF NOT JUST TRANSLATE THIS TO THE AUDITORY SYSTEM YOU HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO CLOSE YOUR EYES AND FOCUS FOR INSTANCE ON PEOPLE TOLK ABOUT THE THIRD EYES CENT OR U NO FOCUSING RIGHT BEHIND YOUR FOREHEAD OYOU KNOW WHY PEOPLE DO THAT WHEN THEY MEDITATE THE REASON IS THAT YOU ACTULLY HAVE NO SENSATION IN YOUR BRAIN IT'S THE ONE PLACE TO FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION FOR WHICH YOU ABANDONE SENSATION RIGHT IF I THINK ABOUT ANY PORTION OF MY BODY OR MY BREATHING I'M EITHER I'M GOING TO SENSE WHAT'S HAPPENING I'M GOING TO PERCEIVE MY ININ INNER LANDSCAPE SILLCALLED INTERRECEPTION OR MY OUTER IF I LOOK OUT INTO THE WORLD IT'S EXTERECEPTION WHEN YOU FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED JUST YOU DO HAVE TO CLOSE YOUR EYES JUST BEHIND YOUR FOREHEAD YOU ARE FOCUSING ON YOUR THINKING RIGHT SORT OF OBVIOUS BUT I DON'T AT LEAST TO ME HAD NEVER BEEN STATED THAT CLEARLY AGAIN ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH SOME OF THE MORE TRADITIONAL PRACTICES BUT ALSO THE PROBLEM WITH SCIENCE IS THAT THERE'S A SHROUDING OF EVERYTHING IN VERY COMPLEX LANGUAGE WHICH SUCKS WHY IS IT'S SUCK BECAUSE IT'S A SEPARATOR YOU EL LIMINATE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT CAN BE BROUGHT TO POTENTIALLY USEFUL PRACTICSIS AND I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF OVER USE MECHANISM AND DESCRIPTIONS OF YOU KNOW FANCY PHRASES TO MASK BASIC PRINCIPLES SO SIMPLEST LANGUAGE I THINK IS IS A AH IT TENDS TO UNIFY PEOPLE AROUND THE PRACTICES SO WHEN YOU FOCUS ON THIS SO CALLED THIRDYES CENTERE RIGHT OR A SPOTRIGHT BEHIND YOUR FOREHEAD OR ON YOUR BREATH IT'S LO TRICKY WITH THE BREATH BUT WHEN YOU FOCUS ION YOUR FRONTAL QARTECS THERE'S NOTHING TO SENSE BECAUSE THERE'S NO SCENSORING OUR ONS THERE THERE'S NO TOUCH THERE'S NO PAIN NOTHING THAT'S WHY IN THESE GORY MOVIES YOU KNOW YOU CAN TAKE THE SKULL OFF AND ERE IN NERSURGERIES THE'RE POCING AROUND AND THERE THE PRISON'S FLANG OF ILIND I NO AN AESTHETIC NOW INAESTHETIC DOESN'T REQUIRE ANYSET THERE'S NO SENSORIN OR OUNS CAN'T SENSE ANYTHING THERE SO SPACE TIME BRIDGING INVOLVES IT'S ESENTILIA MEDITATION BUT'S REALLY A PERCEPTIBLE EXERCISE I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOINGUITH THIS IS IT'S STARTS BY CLOSING YOUR EYES AND FOCUSING ON THAT LOCATION FOR WHICH THERE'S NO SENSATION THERE'S ONLY THAUG AND THEN OPENING YOUR EYES AND FOCUSING ON A LOCATION MAY BE ABOUT THE DISTANCE OF YOUR HAND AND YOU FOCUS ALSO ON YOUR BREATHING TO YOU SORT OF IMAGINE A KIND OF A S TEATHER BETWEEN THAT YOU CAN SPLIT YOUR ATTENTION TO THESE TWO LOCATIONS YOU THINKING ABOUT YOUR BODY AND YOU'RE THINKING BOUT A LOCATION OUTSIDE OF YOU AND THEN YOU WHILE CONTINUING TO THINK ABOUT YOUR BODY SO CALLED INTERRACEPTION FOCUS ON YOUR BREATHING YOU FOCUS FURTHER OUT AND THEN FURTHER OUT AND THEN FURTHER OUT AND THEN ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW THE LITTLE CARTOON OR MEN WHERE THE LIKE WE'RE JUST A LITTLE BLUE DOT FLOATING IN A BIG UNIVERSE AND LIKE IT'S MUST MAKE ALL YOUR PROBLEMS GO AWAY I IT KINDOF O WORKS BECAUSE WHAT YOU'VE DONE IS YOU'VE EXPANDED YOUR PERCEPTION AN GO ONLY I LIKE THE STUFF THAT'S APPENING ING HERE IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN I'M FOCUSED ON WHAT'S HAPPENING N HERE BUT WHEN I'M FOCUSED ON WHAT'S GOING ON AND THAT THE KIND OF THE VASTNESS OF ALL THIS AND WERE JUST A LITTLE IN A PALE BLUE DOT AND ALL THAT IT CHANGES YOUR PERCEPTION NOT JUST YOUR VISUAL PERCEPTION OBVIOUSLY CHANGING YOUR VISUAL PERCEPTION CHANGES YOUR COGNIVE PERCEPTION WHICH CHANGES YOUR EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE SO THE SPACETIME BRIDGING IS A IS A PERCEPTIAL EXERCISE WERE YOU STEP FROM FOCUSSING INTERNALLY TO FOCUSSING EXTERNALLY AT A SHORT DISTANCE THAN A FURTHER DISTANCE FURTHER DISTANCE FURTHER DISTANCE AND THEN TRYING TO IMAGINE YOURSELF IN THIS LARGER LANDSCAPE ITSOWNDS VERY MYSTICAL BUT IT'S ASHY VERY NOROBIOLOGICAL AND IT CAPTURE SOMETHING REALLY AMAZING WHY IS THE TEA IN THERE THE TIME SPACE TIME BRIDGING CAUSE THIS IS SPACE BUT TIME IS IN THERE BECAUSE WHEN YOU FOCUS IN CLOSE YOU'RE SLICING OF TIME IS FINER YOU NOTICE THE SUBTLE FLUCTUATIONS IN YOUR BREATHING AND THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING UP CLOSE WHEREAS WHEN YOU FOCUS FURTHER OUT YOUR PERCEPTION OF TIME ACTUALLY CHANGES WHICH IS WHY IN PANORAMIC VISION WE ARE CALM AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WE'RE JUST A PALE BLUE DO AND WE MOST ONLY LIVE TO ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE OR NINE HUNDRED YEARS OLD AND THEN LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW MY BOSS BING IN IT AJURC AND ALL THAT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER BECAUSE YOU KNOW LIKE THE EARTH IS SPENNING AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF WHICH IS ALL TRUE AND IS THE STUFF OF PHILOSOPHY AND MINDFULNESS AND I THINK IS BEAUTIFUL WHAT YOU'RE REALLY DOING IS YOU'RE CHANGING YOUR TIME PERCEPTION BY CHANGING YOUR SPACE PERCEPTION SO SPACETIME BRIDGING IS VERY USEFUL BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE GET LOCKED AT ONE STEP ONE OF THESE SPATIONS ESPECIALLY UNDER CONDITIONS OF STRESS AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE A TROUBLE FOCUSSING I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THIS UP IN THIS CONTEXT OF EIGHTY EIGHT TEP PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME FOCUSING WHETHER NOT THEY AVE EIGHTY EIGHED E OR NOT TEND TO SKIP BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN DIFFERENT SPACE TIME DOMAINS AS WE CALL THEM IN SCIENCE SO THIS IS A SIMPLE EXERCISE THAT YOU CAN DO FOCUSING INTERNALLY THEN STEPTING OUT EXTERNALLY THEN STEPING BACK IN ALL THE WHILE PAYING ATTENTION TO YOUR INNER AND THE LANDSCAPE JUST SIMPLY BY FOCUSSING ON YOUR BREATHING AM IT'S A TOOL THAT WE'RE STILL COLLECTING DATE ON IN TERMS OF ITS UTILITY BUT PEOPLE ARE ALREADY USING IT AND AM I DON'T THINK OF IS IMEDITATION I THINK OF IT IS A PERCEPTIONAL EXERCISE THANKS FOR ASKING THET CAAUSE HA TEENAGE OUR WHAT ORE FIVE THINGS YOU WOULD RECOMMEND TO PHYSICALLY FEEL MY BEST I'M A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SURF OR WHO ATTENDS HIGH SCHOOL AND PLACE SOCKER IT SOMETHING YOU'RE DOING A LOT OF THINGS RIGHT UM TO PHYSICALLY FEEL YOUR BEST BOUQUET SO I'M IN A GRASP AT SOME COMTEXT HERE THAT I'M NOT UM THAT'S NOT WITHIN REACH UM I'M ASSUMING IF YOU ARE DOING ALL THESE THINGS YOU'RE HOFLY DOING A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS TOO AND THER GOING TO BE DEMANDS ON YOU THAT YOU Y SOME OF THEM YOU DON'T WANT TO DO SCHOOL ON THINGS LIKE THAT UM ARE GOING TO HAVE VARYING LEVELS OF LIKE JOY AND DELIGHT AND DEMAND UM OF THINGS YOU DON'T WANT TO DO I I  I DON' WANT A DEFAULT ALWAYS TO THE SIMPLEST OF TOOLS BUT I I CERTAINLY THINK THAT EVEN AS A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD IF YOU'RE NOT ALREADY GETTING A LOTS AND LOTS OF SLEEP THAT'S GOING TO BE GREAT TELL YOUR PARENTS THAT I SAID YOU SHOULD GET LOTS AND LOTS OF SLEEP BRY YOURE NOT SLEEPING THROUGH CLASSES I AM A PROFESSOR AFTER ALL I COULDN'T A I TELL YOU OTHERWISE UM YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY IF I COULD TRAVEL BACK IN TIME AS A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CULTIVATE SOME SORT OF MINDFULNESS PRACTISE I KNOW THE SOUNDS A LITTLE CLICHET BUT HAVING SOME AWARENESS OF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT YOUR THINKING IS GOOD BUT I'M ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO SAY SIT DOWN AND MEDITATE FOR TEN MINUTES A DAY OR DO ANESTY ARE I'M I'M ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO TELL YOU THAT I THINK GIVEN HOW PLASTIC YOUR BRAIN IS HOW MUCH IT'S CHANGING AT FIFTEEN I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU AND MAYBE WOULD SET A TIMER FOR THIS TO ACTUALLY DEVELOP JUST A REALLY KEEN AWARENESS OF WHAT STRESSES YOU OUT WHAT RELAXES YOU WHAT DELIGHTS YOU ET CETERA AND JUST A SIMPLY DEVELOP IN AWARINESS OF THAT BECAUSE THOSE ARE YOUR UNTENI AND I CERTAINLY HAD A MEDITATION PRACTICE AS A YOUTH MOSTLY GIVEN TO ME BECAUSE I WAS A LITTLE HAY WIRE AND I NEEDED IT UM AND IT WORKED PRETTY WELL BUT I THINK IN RETROSPECT WHAT I WISH I HAD DEVELOPED WAS MORE OF A SENSE OF YOUHOW I NAVIGATED STRESS OR THINGS AND THINGS I ENJOYED IN THINGS I DIDN'T ENJOY AND I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO HAVE A GENERAL AWARENESS TRYING DETECT AND LEARN ABOUT WHAT BRAISES YOURE DRENNAL AND WHAT RAISES YOU'RE DOPE O ME N WHAT RAISES YOUR SARE TONE AND AND THEN START THINKING ABOUT TOOLS UM BUT AGAIN THE AWARENESS IS GOING TO BE VERY VALUABLE AND GOSH AS A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD YOU ARE IN THIS YOU KNOW AMAZING BLESSED PERIOD OF HEIGHTENEROL PLASTICITY SHOULD WE ALL BE SO LUCKY SO ENJOY IT NEXT QUESTION PLEASE CLARITY ON A DRENLIN REGARDING COLD WATER SHOULD WE WAIT TO FEEL THE RISE OF A DRENALIN THA GET ME OUT HERE FEELING AN THE FAULL OF IT BEFORE BAILING YES PROVIDED IT DOESN'T KILL YOU YOU KNOW I I DON'T WANT TO SAY COL WATER IT'S HARD TO KILL YOURSELF WITH COLD WATER UM PROVIDE YOUR HEADS ABOVE IN YOU BREATHING BUT THE UM IT'S I MY PODCASPERUSE IS ALWAYS  I I CAN'T HELP THAT THE ANYWAY UM IT'S IT'S A GREAT TOOL AND DIFFERENT DAYS IT'LL FEEL DIFFERENT SO FOR INSTANCE DOING COLD ANY KIND OF A DRENDLIN AND DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE OR A DRENNLIN INCREASING ACTIVITY EARLY IN THE DAY YOU MIGHT FIND THAT YOU ARE MORE QUOTTINQUAT RESILIENT THAN LATER IN OTHER WORDS THE WALL LIKE A REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THIS THIS IS ACTUALLY INTERESTING FOR I THINK IT EXTENDS BEYOND COLD WATER LET SAY YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING PAY ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT MAYBE IT'S NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO BUT ASSUMING IT' SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD DO BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO YOU ARE ALREADY IN THE FIRST WAL OF A DRENINE YOU DON'T EXPERIENCE IT NECESSARILY AS HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF STRESS YOU MIGHT EXPERIENCE IT AS HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF FATIGUE OR A HARD TIME SHIFTING ON THAT KIND OF ACTIVATION STATE THAT'S REQUIRE TO MOVE THROUGH THE THING BUT I DO ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT UM OF COURSE AND WE HAVE AN EPISODE COMING OUT TO MORROW ACTUALLY THAT ANSWERS QUESTIONS LIKE SHOULD YOU TRAIN IF YOU'RE SICK AND YOU KNOW WHAT IF YOU TRAVELIN AND YOU KNOW THERE'S CONTAXT ALWAYS BUT I THINK THAT YOU DO WANT TO EXPERIENCE IF YOU WANT TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THE COLD WATER EXPOSURE AND TO BE MORE SPECIFIC THE ADRENALIN THEN YOU WANT TO GET TO THAT POINT OF I REALLY WANT TO GET OUT HERE BUT I KNOW I CAN STAY IN SAFELY BUT I REALLY WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE AND IT'S IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO EXPLAIN BUT THERE'S JUST SO MUCH LEARNING IN THOSE SHORT MOMENTS ABOUT WHERE YOUR MIND GOES AND THIS SOUNDS VERY KIND OF AGAIN SUBJECTIVE AND MAYBE A LL WISH YOU WASHY BUT YOU CAN REALIZE GREAT THINGS ABOUT YOURSELF IN THOSE MOMENTS YOU CAN FIND INSIGHT IN THOSE MOMENTS ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE DEGREE OF DISCOMFORT NOT JUST PHYSICAL BUT MENTAL DISCOMFORT I'S  DIRECTLY PREDICTIVE OF THE PAIN TO PLEASURE WAVE THAT YOU'LL EXPERIENCE AFTERWARDS THE REASON'T FEEL SO GOOD WHEN YOU GET OUT OF THE ICE BATH AND YOUR SHOWERED OFF I WOUS DO THE WARM SHOWER AFTER I DON'T DO THIS END ON COLD THING I DON'T KNOW JUS SEEMS  TO PAINFUL AND THEN TAKE A WARM SHOWER AND HN YOU FEEL GREAT AND THAT'S THE SURGE OF DOPAMINE THAT WE KNOW BASED ON A PAPER PUBLISHIN THE URPEAN JOURNAL PHYSIOLOGY LAST MANY HOURS AND IT'S A ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED PER CENT INCREASE IN DOPAMIN IS NOT A SUBTLE OF FACT AND THEN PEOPLE SAY WILL WAIT IS THAT DOBAMING IN TO CRASH MY DOBA MEAN SYSTEM KNOW BECAUSE IT'S A NICE SLOW RISE IN FACT I AM ACTUALLY NOT AWARE OF MANY THINGS BESIDES LOVE AND DELIGHT THAT CAN CREATE THIS LONG SL ARC OF DOPAMIN LASTING MANY HOURS MAYBE YOU'RE AWARE OF OTHER THINGS IF YOU ARE LET ME KNOW BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT LONG ARC IS A A TRUE ANTI DEPRESSENT AND MY COLLEAGUE GET STAMFORD DOCTOR ONOLYMPKI WHO'S AHEAD OF OUR DO DIAGNOSIS DICTION CLINIC HAS TALKED ABOUT IN HER AMAZING BOT DOPAMI NATION ABOUT PATIENCE OF HERS THAT IF REALLY HELPD THEMSELVES ALONG AND OUT OF THE MORE DEPRESSIVE PHASES OF YOU KNOW R YOU KNOW WORKING THROUGH A DICTION AND IN JUST DEPRESSION IN GENERAL THROUGH DIRECTED COLD WATER THERAPY SO IE YOU KNOWI I'M OVOUSLY A FANATIC ABOUT IT IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S A POWERFUL RELATIVELY SAFE IF DONE PROPERLY SAFE IF DONE PROPERLY WAY TO MODULATE YOUR INTERNAL DOPAME HOPFULLY I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION NEXT QUESTION PLEACE I SORRY I CAUGHT IT RAYS AND WENT OFF THE FALL AS WELL YES I THINK YOU SHOULD GET OUT ONCE YOUR ONCE YOUR YOU'VE ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING DON'T GET OUT WHEN YOPANIC UNLESS ITS DANGEROUS SARE HOW CAN YOU TRAIN YOUR BRAIN TO FEEL MORE CONFIDENT MOMENTS WHERE YOU TEND TO FEEL INTIMIDATED AH O KE ES HARD QUESTION AM BECAUSE CONTEXT IS TRICKY HERE CAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CONTEXT IS AND YOU KNOW CONFIDENCE ON SHORT TIME SCALES AND THEN LONG TIME SCALES TO CONFIDENCE IN SCHOOL CONFIDENCE AND CAREER THOSE ARE YOU KNOW THOSE ARE LONG LONG OUR THINGS WERE AS CONFIDENCE TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW DO SOMETHING IN THE SHORT TERM IS DIFFERENT BUT REMEMBER THOSE ACTION SEQUENCES THAT TRIGGER THE RELEASE OF DOPAMINE DON'T BEMEAN I'VE MAINLY TALKED ABOU THE DARK SIDE OF DOPAMINE BUT I HOFULLY ALSO TALKED ABOUT THAT T'SO UPWARD SPIRAL THAT DOPAMI CAN CAUSE MAINLY BY THINKING ABOUT DELIGHT AND THINGS THAT YOU REALLY ENJOY THE THAT CARRIES OVER AND I WOULD SAY THAT YOU WANT IM YOU WANT TO MICRO SLICE THE DEMANDS OF WHAT'S MAYBE GOT YOU BACK ON YOUR HEELS A BIT AM I SHE COULD FRENDAMINE WHO'S HERE TO NIGHT I THINK ALSO MY FRIEND PAT YO HE HAS A GREAT WAY OF AI YOU NOW CONCEPTIOALIZING THIS WHICH IS YOU KNOW IT FOR MOST ALL ENDEAVOURS WERE EITHER FEEL BACK ON OUR HEELS FLATFOOTED OR FORWARD CENTERE OF MASS LIKE WE CAN REALLY DO SOMETHING WE'RE FLATFOOD O WERE BACK ON OUR HEELS AND SOMETIMES GETTING FROM BACK ON OUR HEELS LAT LET'S CALL THAT LACK OF CONFIDENCE TO JUST YOU KOW ON TO FEET AND CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO MOVE FORWARD OR AT LEAST STAY IN THE IN THE GAME THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE YOU COULD LEAN ON DIFFERENT TOOLS I CAN'T SAY WHICH WOULD BE IDEAL FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCE YERE YOU HAVE IN MIND BUT I DO THINK THAT HAVING AWAY TO CALM YOURSELF WE'LL GIVE YOU ACCESS TO MORE RESOURCES INTERNAL RESOURCES WE KNOW THIS THIS WAS SOMETHING I MEANT TO BRING UP DURING THE DISCUSSION ABOUT FEAR VERSIS LOVE ET CETERA TRYING TO ACTS AS DELIGHT AND LOVE WHEN WE ARE IN A STATE OF FEAR OR STRESS OR ANXIETY THE RULE SET THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO US AND INDEED OUR CREATIVITY IS GREATLY DIMINISHED AND THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE WAY THAT THE PREFRONTAL QARTEC INTER ACTS WITH AN AIRY THE WRINKLED THE INSULA WHICH RELATES TO OUR INTERNAL LANDSCAPE AND THERE'S HIS WEIRD PHENOMENON WHICH IS IT NORMALLY OUR BRAIN OUR THINKING RAIN AND OR RULE SETTING BRAIN CAN IT LEADS OUR THE BRAIN PARTS THAT CONTROL AND PAY ATTENTION TO HOW WE FEEL INTERNALLY AND THAT'S WHY FOR INCTANCE IF YOU FEEL WILL NERVOUS YOU CAN STILL DO SOMETHING AT'S SOME POINT YOU GET STRESSED ENOUGH AND WE KNOW THIS FROM WORK BY MY COLLI DAVIT'S BEAGLE IT REVERSES AND THESE ARREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE PAYING ATTENTION LIKE HOW FLUSHED MY FACES ARE WITH AN AM SWEATING OR MY BREATHING ASHALLY START TO SHUT DOWN CREATIVE DECISION MAKING SO I WOULD SAY THE WAY TO HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE IS TO LEARN TO CONTROL THAT STRESS AND KEEP THE PART OF YOUR BRAIN THE PREFUNTAL QUARTEXS IS THAT PART THAT CAN COME UP WITH NEW RULES THAT CAN BE FUNNY THAT CAN BE CREATIVE THAT KEEPS THAT BRAIN PART LEADING THE WAY THING ABOUT THIS IS THE PROVUNTAL QUARTEX IS OR LIKE THE COACH AND THE REST YOUR RAINERS AR LIKE THE PLAYERS AND IF YOU GET TOO STRESSED THE PLAYERS START TO LEAD THE GAME IN THE COACH FOLLOWS NOW DRAGS THEM ALONG SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO FOCUSS ON REAL TIME STRESS MODULATION AND TO RAISE YOUR STRESTTHRESHOLD USING THE SORTS OF TOOS WE TALKED ABOUT AND TO REGISTER YOUR WINDS YOU KNOW I DIDN'T GET INTO THIS AND TOO MUCH DETAIL BUT ONE OF THE AMAZING THINGS ABOUT THE DOPAMIN SYSTEM IS THAT IT'S HIGHLY SUBJECT TO YOUR INTERPRETATION IF YOU TELL YOURSELF THAT A FAIL WAS A WIN AND YOU CAN SEE OR CONCEPTIALIZE SOME WAY IN WHICH THAT'S ACTUALLY TRUE YOU GET TO TAP INTO THE DOPAMIN SYSTEM YOU MIGHT THINK THAT'S CRAZY YOU CAN CHEAT YOUR OWN BRAIN YOU CAN CHEAT YOUR OWN NERRO CHEMISTRY AND INDEED YOU CAN YOU CAN CHANGE THE TIME SPACE TIME REFERENCE AND WE SEE THIS WITH EXAMPLES LIKE NELSON MEN DELL ARE VICTOR FRANKAL YOU YOU READ THEIR STORIES RIGHT TRAPPED IN LITTLE SELLS IT CONFINED IMPRISONED AND THEY COME UP WITH NEW WAYS TO ACESS THE DOPAMIN SYSTEM ABY NOW NOT THINKING ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING BUT THINKING ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN CONTROL IN THEIR IMMEDIATE EXPERIENCE MANY MANY EXAMPLES OF THIS THROUGHOUT LITERATURE AND HISTORY AND THE DOPAMEN SYSTEM IS THE LIFE FOR SYSTEM I DON'T SAY THAT IN ANY LOOSE WAY DOPAMINE IS LIFE FORCE IT'S THE WISH IN THE DESIRE TO CONTINUE IT'S PERSISTENCE AND SO IF YOU CAN THINK ABOUT WHAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE A FAILURE AND REALLY SPEND SOME TIME THINKING ABOUT NOT THE POTENTIAL WINDS ON THE OUTSIDE BUT HOW YOU CAN CANCEPTIALIZE THAT IS A POTENTIAL WIN INTERNALLY YOU REALLY DO GET TO ACHIEVE AN INTERNAL CHEMICAL WIN AND THAT CHEMICAL WIN SETS YOU UP FOR MORE REAL WINDS FOR THAT MAKE SENSE IT'S INCREDIBLE HOW CONTEXTURALIZE THE DOPAMI SYSTEM IS BUT IF IT WEREN'T WHY WOULD IT MATTER IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MONEY OR MATES OR FOOD OR JOB OR SCHOOL YOU DON'T GET FIFTY REWARD SYSTEMS AND MOTIVATION SYSTEMS YOU GET ONE AND THAT'S THE DOPAMING SYSTEM NEXT QUESTION PLEASE WHAT IS THE COMPETING MECHANISM BEHIND BYLATERAL EVE MOVEMENT M D'AR THAT HELPS RESOLVE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAMA THE COMPETING MECHANISM AH WELL LET ME LET ME TRY AN ANSWER AS BEST I CAN A NUTTRY UNDERSTAND THE FULL EXTENT OF THE QUESTION BU LIME UM E M D'AR MOVING YOUR EYES FROM SIDE TO SIDE RIGHT THEN THEN RECOUNTING A TRAMA IS A VERY CAMAN AND ACTUALLY ONE OF THE FOR APPROVE TREATMENTS THAT ARE BEHAVIOR OL FOR TRAMA I'M SO IT'S CONTAKEN SERIOUSLY IN THE PSYCHACTRIC AND CYCOLOGICAL COMMUNITY FOR GOOD REASON IT TENDS TO WORK BEST FOR SINGLE EVENT TRAMAS AS APPOST LIKE ENTIRE CHILDHOODS I'M NO JOKE THERE LIKE MEUN SOME YOULE OF THEIR ENTIRE CHILDHOOD WITH DRAMATIC OTHER PEOPLE THEY EXPERIENCE A TRAMA A SINGLE EVENT TRAMA OR REPEATED PERIODS OF THE SAME WERE SIMILAR TYPE OF TRAMA I MOVEMENTS FROM SIDE TO SIDE HAVE BEEN SHOWN IN A NUMBER OF STUDIES TO VERY POTENTLY REDUCE THE ACTIVITY OF A BRAIN STRUCTURE CAL THE IMIGDALA WHICH MOST PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH BECAUSE OF THE CHARACTER FROM THE STARWORDS MOVI MIDAA UM THERE'S A NURRSIGN TO SOMEWHERE ON THE THE THE THAT TEAM UM IT IS INDEED A THREAT DETECTION CENTER AND WHEN YOU MOVE THROUGH SPACE NOT OUTER SPACE BUT WHEN YOU WALK LIKE THIS YOUR EYES ACTUALLY GENERATE THESE SUTTLE SIDE TOSIDE SHIFTS UNLESS YOUR FOCASING ON A SPECIFIC TARGET AND MY LAB AND OTHER LABORATORIES HAVE FOUND THAT THAT LEADS TO A VERY POTENT QUIETING OF THE THREAT DETECTION SYSTEM AND THEN E M DIAR IS ESSENTUALLY A PROCESS OF PAIRING THAT CALMER STATE WITH NO THREAT DETECTION SYSTEM ACTIVATED WITH THE RECOUNT OF SOMETHING THAT NORMALLY WOULD BE QUITE TRIGGERING SO IT'S YOU'VE HEARD OF PAVLOVIAN CONDITIONING LIKE A BELL RINGS IN THE ANIMAL GETS FED AND ANDIMAL SALEVATES EVENTUALLY JUST THE BELL WILL AVOKE THE SALVATION YOU'RE DOING THE REVERSE OF THAT IT'S  CALLED BEHAVIORAL DESENSES ATION AS UNDERLYING MECHANISM ET CETERA BUT THE IDEAS TO PAIR A CALM STATE WITH RECOUNT OF SOMETHING IT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE SUCCESSFUL THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THE SIDE TOSIDE I MOVEMENTS AND THE RECOUNT OF TRAMA MAY ACTUALLY BE INVOKING SOME FORM OF HYPNOSIS I MY COLLEAGUE DAVID SPEGOLS YOUR EXPERT IND CLINICAL HYPNOSS IS APPEARED ON MY PODCAST RETROLS PDCAST ANA YEW OTHER PODCASTS AND TALKS ABOUT THIS IT IS NOT STAGESHYPNOSIS ITS CLINICAL HYPNOSIS SO THERE MAY BE SOMETHING GOING ON THERE  M D'AR YEN SOME PEOPLE GET GREAT RELIEF FROM IT OTHER PEOPLE DON'T WHAT'S KIND OF NICE IS THAT THIS I MOVEMENTS FROM SIDE TO SIDE OR SIMPLY TAKING A WALK AS ELLAS YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT YOUR PHONE AND NOT ALLOWING YOUR EYES TO MOVE FROM SIDE TO SIDE IS A VERY GOOD WAY TO SHUT DOWN THE FEAR IN STRESS SYSTEM SO TAKING A WALK I THINK IT'S RELAXING FOR OBVIOUS REASONS AND THERE AR DATA SHOWING THAT YOU KNOWPART THE REASON WHY ANIMAL SCR CTH AT THE DOOR AND WHAN TO GO FOR WALK MAY NOT ACTUALLY BE THE EXERCISEORS KIND OF AN ANXIETY IN AN AN ANXIETY RELIEF THAT OCCURS OF COURSE THEY I HAVE TO GO THE BATHROOM TO ONE OF COSTELL'S GREAT JOYS IN LIFE WAS JUST PEIN ON EVERYTHING UM OUTDOORS THANKFULLY UM SO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TROMA REWIRING UNFORTUNAT TE HAVEN'T BEEN A LOT OF BRAIN IMAGING STUDIES LONG LOOKING AT THIS LONG TERM OF HOW WILL M DO OUR WORKS WHAT I THINK IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS BY THE WAY IS IT IS NOT GOING TO BE A DISCUSSION AROUND SHOULD YOU DO M D'AR SHOULD YOU DO TRAINS CRANUAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION SHOULD YOU DO BEHAVIOUR OLTHERY IT'S GOING O BE COMMONATION THERAPIES COMMINATION THERE BE'S INCLUDING PHARMICOLOGIC MANIPULATIONS TO ESSENTIALLY GIVE A BOOST TO THE SYSTEMS THAT ENCOURAGE INERAL PLASTICITY LIKE DOPAMIN IN SERTONE AND AND  GENTLEMEN AND THEN ALSO THEN PERFORM E M D ARE IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE LANDSCAPE OF CLINICAL TRIALS ON SOME OF THE PSYCHODELICS ON HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT IT THEY'RE STILL E LEGAL UM BUT THEY ARE BEING USED IN CLINICAL TRIALS AND VERY INTERESTING STUFF IS HAPPENING THERE LOOKATE NEXT QUESTION PLEASE WHAT NO RESEARCH OR INTERVENTIONS ARE YOU MUST EXCITE ABOUT IN THE REALM OF O WIT A WELLNESS SO WHAT I THINK IS GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTING IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS REALLY REFLECTS MY AN OBSESSION THAT YOU'VE SEEN A LITTLE BIT OF TO NIGHT BUT THE THING NI THING IT'S GOING TO BE MOST USEFUL AND I'VE SEEN THIS IN SCIENCE BEFORE AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE IT IN HEALTH IN WELLNESS IS THAT THER'RE ALL THESE TOOLS AND ALL THESE PEOPLE AND HE SAYING THIS AND SHE SAYING THAT AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO STAR PAYING ATTENTION TO IS WHAT ARE THE COMMON THEMES RIGHT I IT AND A BROADER AND MORE IMPORTANT THEME IS GOING T BE ONE OF MODULATION VERSES MEDIATION WHAT DO I MEAN WELL IF SOME ONE WERE TO PULL A FIRE ALARM RIGHT NOW PLEASE DON'T THAT WILL SHIFT OUR ATTENTION AND MAKE IT HARD TO FOCUS IN WHAT I'M SAYING AND KNOWING ME IPLOGUST SAY UP HERE TALKING DO WE THINK THAT FIRE ALARMS MEDIATE ATTENTION NUM THEY MODULATE IT RIGHT IF IT WERE VERY VERY COLD IN THIS ROOM LIKE IT WAS WHEN WE FIRST GOT HERE TO NIGHT THE'RE ARCTIC COLD UM HELTHLEET'S WARMED UP A BIT E IT HASN'T I'M SO SORRY SO SORRY UM YE I ATEMPTED TO YE I ALMOST THOUGHT MAY WE ALL JUST DO ABUNCH YOUR BREATHING TO HEAT UP LIKE A GRENTALIN RELEASE BUT NOW THESE DAYS GETTING GRUPS OF PEOPLE ALL BREATHE ON EACH OTHER S OT EXACTLY I CAN SEE THAT MIGHT GO THE WRONG WAY IN TERMS OF WHAT PEOPLE INTERPRET SO THE THE IDEA HERE IS THAT CERTAIN THINGS DIRECTLY MEDIATE SOMETHING LIKE A PHYSIOLOGICAL SIDE DIRECTLY CALMS YOU DOWN QUICKLY IT MEDIATES THE COMMING RESPONSE GETTING GOOD SLEEP MAKES YOU LESS EASILY TRIGGERED IT MODULATES STRASS BUT IS SLEEPING DIRECTLY MEDIATING STRESS CONTROL NO AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND THIS BRINGS UP THE TOPIC OF THE GOT BRAIN AXIS THE GOT IS RICH WITH THESE LITTLE BUGS BACTERIA TRILLIONS OF THEM WHICH IS AN ERE THOUGHT TO ME BUT ALSO THE SURFACE OF YOUR SKIN THE SURFACE OF YOUR EYES YOU HAVE A SKIN MICROBYO MA NAZAL MICROBYOM EVERY MUCOSAL LINING HAS A MICROBYOM IN FACT THINK ABOUT THIS IT'S THIS IS A CRAZY BUT WORTH WHILE TANGENT HAVE YOU EVER BIT IN THE INSIDE YOUR MOUTH IT'S SOCKS RIGHT AND GET A COT AN A HURT BUT GESS WHAT THE INSIDE OF YOUR MOUTH HEELS WITHOUT A SCAR BUT THAT WEIRD RIGHT YOU CUT ANYWHERE ELSE ON YOUR BODY AND DEPENDING ON HOW WELL YOU HEEL AND YOUR AGE IN YOUR IMUNE STATUS YOU GET A SCAR YOUR MOUTH IS FILLED WITH BACTERIA AND IT'S OPEN TO THE WORLD BUT THE GOT MICROBIOM PROVIDED IT'S HEALTHY PROVIDES AND INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO HEEL QUICKLY AND YOU KNOW I'M NOT SOMEBODY WHO'S DONE A LOT OF ACCUPUNCTURE I'VE WENT A FEW TIMES AND OTHER'S INTERESTING SCIENCE HAPPENING ON MACUPUNCTUBUT WHAT'S THE FIRST THING THEY DO WHEN YOU WALK IN THERE HUN AND THEN THEY GOT MY YAT AND THEY HAVE THIS COOL INTUITION THAT'S NOT BASED ON WESTERN MECHANISTIC SCIENCE IT'S MORE OF AN INTUITION BASED ON MILLIONS IF NOT BILLIONS OF DATA POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT INTO THESE CHARTS IT'S PRETTY COOL RIGHT AND WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT I BELIEVE AND FROM WHAT MICOLLEAGUES WHO WORK ON MICROBYOM TELL ME IS THACAN LOOK AT THE PALLOR OF YOUR TONGUE IN PARTICULAR IN THE BACK AND GET A SENSE OF WHETHER NOT THE MICROBIOM THERE IS OF THE APPROPRIATE STOFF BUT THEY DON'T GO LACK OBASILIS ANDEMBSI THEY ALL ONTO ILLIS RIGHT BUT THEY OW YOU'RE JUST BIOTIC INSTEAD THEY GET A SENSE NOW PARENTS OF SMALL BABIES LEARN TO DETECT ALL SORTS OF THINGS COMING OUT OF ESSENTIAY EVERY ORIFICE OF THE CHILD AS A READ OUT OF HEALTH BECAUSE THE CHILD DOESN'T HAVE LANGUAGE AND A DOGOWN EARTIN UNFORTUNATELYU LEARN TO DO THIS TOO FOR BETTER FOR WORST PRIDE FOR BETTER RIGHT SO WE HAVE THIS INTUITION ABOUT GOT HEALTH BUT GOT HEALTH WOULD BE ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHERE IT'S VERY CLEAR NOW THAT FIBER CAN BE HEALPFUL BUT IT'S MOSTLY CONSUMING THESE FERMENTED FOODS THAT BEEN USED IN FOR AGES BUT LOSURDER FOMENTIFOODS OF THE NOTO KIMCHI SOUR CROWD COMBOOCHA ET CETERA LIKE ALL THESE THINGS THE DEPENDING ON WHICH CULTURE YOU'RE IN THEY COME IN DIFFERENT FORMS CERTAIN YOGERTS ET CETERA THAT ALLOW THAT GOT TO BE HEALTHY AND IT MODULATES A HUGE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS SO I DON'T THINK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CURE DEPRESSION BY A JUSTING YOU'RE GOT MICROBIOM BUT IF YOU'RE GOT MICROBIOTA ARE NOT WEALTH AND YOU IMPROVE THAT IT WILL INDEED SHIFT THE NARROW TRANSMITTER SYSTEMS OF YOUR BRAIN AND GIVE YOU A ELEVATED MOOD THUT SHOULDN'T COME AS OF SURPRISE ANY MORE BUT I THINK THAT THE WHOLE WORLD THINGS IK COSH IT MUST BE THE SERATONAN IN THE GUT NO IT'S ACTUALLY NOT CERATONI GOT IT'S THAT THE IT'S GOT MICROBIOTO CREATE CHEMICALS THAT ACTUALLY BECOME SERATONAN IN THE BRAIN OR BECOME DOPENING IN THE BRAIN AND SO I THINK THAT THE GOT MICROBYOM I WOULD PUT IN THE SAME CATEGORY ALTHOUGH NOT QUITE AS IMPORTANT I' PUT I IN THE CATEGORY LIKE SLEEP IT MODULATES A HUGE NUMBER OF OTHER PROCESSIES IT DOESN'T MEDIATE THEM SO SUNLIGHT SLEEP HEALTHY GOT MICROBIOUM EXERCISE GOOD NUTRICION SOCIAL CONNECTION THESE THINGS ALL CREATE THIS GENERAL MILU OR ENVIRONMENT OF HEALTH I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE DISTINCTION BETWEEN MODULATING AND MEDIATING TO AFFECTS AND TOOLS OUT THERE BECAUSE I I ALSO SEE A LOT OF UNNECESSARY ARGUMENT YOU'RE LIKE THERE'S NO EXAMPLE THAT IMPROVING YOUR GOT MICROBIUM CUROUS DEPRESSIONS I'M COURSE THERE'S NOT BUT THE'RE REALLY GOOD EXAMPLES IF YOURE GOT MICRO BYOM IS OFF THAT IMPROVING IT CAN IMPROVE MOOD WHICH IN DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE ON THAT SPECTRUM OF DEPRESSION CAN REALLY RELIEVE THINGS SO I THINK THAT THAT THE FUTURE OF HEALTH YOU KNW WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT PERSONALIZE MEDICINE AND MATCHED YOUR GENO BUT IWE KNOWINGON OF THE BASIC MOST PEOPLE DON'T EVEN HAVE THE BASICS RIGHT AND IF YOU WATCH OR LISTEN TO THE PODCAST LONG ENOUGH HOPEFULLY CERTAIN THEME STARTS A KIND OF REPEAT THEMSELVES BUT A KEY THEME THAT A YOU LEARN IN SCIENCE YOU TEACH YOUR STUDENTS YOUR LETS DOES IT MODULATOR T DOESNIT MEDIATE IT YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR LANGUAGE THERE AND THERE'S GREAT INFORMATION AND OR AS WE SAY INTERPRETATIONAL POWER THERE IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE THEND I THINK WE CAN GO A LONG WAY BY MAKING THAT DISTINCTION MODULATING VERSES MEDIATING ETHER PROBABLY OTHER THINGS THAT MODULATE HEALTH THAT I'M OVERLOOKING NOW JUST BECAUSE OF A THE THE FLOW THAT I'M IN THE COOL MIT YE THE COOLMI PALMER COOLING O GET I PROMISE TO TALK ABOUT COT PALMER COOLING WELL I'LL DO IT NOW PALMER COOLING THEY CHANGE THE CUEAN AFORM AT LOKI SIT IS IS LIKE TEACHING IN THE CLASSROOM ALL RIGHT VERY BRIEFLY THE PALMER COOLING WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY PLACING YOU CAN COOL THE CORE OF THE BODY MOST QUICKLY BY PLACING COLD OBJECTS ON THE HANDS THE BOTTOMS OF THE FEET OR ON THE TOP OF THE FACE BECAUSE OF THE ARRANGEMENT OF VASCULATURE NORMALLY YOU GOT THIS ARTERIES CAPLARIES VAINS THINGS BUT IN AT THOSE LOCATIONS IN THE BODY YOU SKIP THE CAPILARIES AND YOU CAN BASELY YOU'RE NOT REALLY PASSING COOL INTO TE BODY BUT YOUR COOLING OFF THE CORE OF THE BODY MORE QUICKLY AND IF YOU DO THAT IN BETWEEN SETS OF EXERCISE OR DURING A ROD NOR CYCLING YOU CAN DRAMATICALLY INCREASE YOURE ABILITY TO CONTINUE ACTUALLY USE THE COOL MIT FOR COGNATIVE WORK BUT YOU DON'T NEED A COOL MIT A SORRY COOLMIT GUIS E YOU CAN JUST GET A A A THING OF ICE WATER OR JUST VERY COLD WATER AND YOU I KNOW IT SOUNDS TRIVIALLY EASY YOUR ACTUALLY JUST COOLING YOUR CORE BY PUTTING YOUR HANDS OR EVEN ONE HA AND ON A RELATIVELY COLD THING OF WATER OR ICE BUT NOT SO COLD THAT IT CONSTRICTS TE THE VASCULAR TURE THERE THIS'S THE INCREDIBLE WORK OF MY COLLIG AT STAMFORD DOCTOR CRAK HELLER WHY WOULDN'T MORE PEOPLE DO THIS IF YOU CAN DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF ENDURANTS BELIEVE IT ARE NOT OR DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF SETS OF EXERCISE YOU CAN DO OR FEEL MORE ALERT AND DO MORE COGNIVE WORK WHY WOULDN'T MORE PEOPLE DO IT BECAUSE PEOPLE JUST DON'T DO IT AND IT SOUNDS CRAZY IT REALLY SOUNDS CRAZY BUT IT'S A REAL THING AND I WISH MORE PEOPLE DO IT THE ATHLETES AT STAMFORD DO IT PEOPLE TOE MILITARY DO IT SO PEOPLE NO NO AND THEY AND THEY USE IT ENJOY IT IT'S JUST ISTS A IT'S A IT'S ALMOST LIKE SEEMS TOO OFF TARGET FROM THE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH I DON'T KNOW FOR SOME REASON PEOPLE ARE FINALLY ON BOARD BREATHING LIKE IN A SPECIFIC WAY AS A USEFUL TOO A FEW YEARS AGO KNOONE WAS INTO THAT IMAN JUST THINK OF HOW FAR WE'VE COME IT'S INCREDIBLE PEOPLE TIKE ABOUT PSYCHADELICS MEDITATION BREATHING I THINK THE PANDEMIC FOR ALL IT'S PAINS AND YOU KNOW WHAT A CHALLENGING PERIOD FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS DID WAKE PEOPLE UP TO THE IDEA THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE CONTROL OVER YOUR HEALTH BECAUSE THERE'S NO MAGIC FERRY COMING TO DO IT FOR TO YOU AND WITH ALL DO RESPECT THERE'S NO GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT'S GON LIKE DROP OFF THE KIT AT YOUR FRONT DOOR O LIKE HERE'S I TAKE O CARRY ERSELF SO IT'S JUST IT'S JUST NOCK AN I HAPPAN AND IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES SO IT'S A PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY ISSUE HUH E ALL RIGHTELL WHAT LESSONS FROM ESCAPEBOARDING THE FAILURE PART YOU KNOW THE FAILURE FAILURER FAILURE I MEAN FOR ME UM YOUSCAE WORK NEVER WAS A GOODSCAPEBOARDER STILL HAVE CLOSE FRIENDS IN THAT COMMUNITY AN A AR PHOTOGRAPHER AND GUIDE DOES ALL THE VISUALS AND THE OTHER GOZE WHUT DOTE VISUALS FOR OA POTCAST MIKE PLAY BACKING CRIS AN MARTIN ARE ALL OF THAT COMMUNITY  YOU KNOW I THINK THAT FOR ME THAT COMMUNITY WAS REALLY A AS A MICHE WILL SOMETIMES SAY ESCAPE OARDERS HATE EVERYTHING UM MEANING THEY HAVE A VERY HIGH THRESHOLD FOR WHAT THEY CONSIDER ACCEPTABLE IT'S NOT JUST WHAT YOU DO IT'S HOW YOU DO IT SUPERIMPORTANT AND I THINKIN NARROW SCIENCE A THERE' A LOT OF THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF IN SCIENCE IN GENERAL THER'RE A LOT ERE SO MANY PAPERS AND THERE'S SO MANY EXPERIMENTS IY HOW YOU NAVIGATE THAT LANDSCAPE I THINK IT IT HELP ME DEVELOP A SENSE OF TASTE BUT THE TASTE THAT I'M REFERRING TO IS NOT NESSARILY A TASTE OF WHICH SCIENCES COOLER NOT COOL THAT TOO BUT IT CAME THROUGH A FEW TIMES TO NIGHT WHEN I' STRUG ABOUT MY MENTORS YOU KNOW I PICKED BACK THEN SCAPEBOARDIN CAUS I REALLY LIKE THE PEOPLE AND ALSO YOU DIDN'T NEED YOUR PARENTS TO CO TO A GAME AND SO THAT WORKE FOR ME UM AND Y CANT MAKE YOUR OWN SCASU AND I DO THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN IN SCIENCE AND IN EVERYTHING TO SURROUND YOURSELF WITH THE KINDS OF PEOPLE THAT YOU JUST REALLY ENJOY BEING AROUND AND SO TO ME THE PODCASTS RUNNING A LAD FEELS A LOT LIKE SCAPE BOARDING IT'S THE SAME ENERGY IT'S THE SAME NEUROCHEMICAL SYSTEMS FIRING S TH AT THAT'S A YO ONE NEXT U FAVORITE FINE OH OH I KNOW THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE UM I I DO HAVE A FINEMEN'S STORY UM BUT IT'S INAPPROPRIATE UM ARN'T IT UH MAYBE SOME TIME IS WHAY I DON'T DRINK UM GOOD DECISION MAKING UM WELL I READ ALL A FINEMENS BOOKS TSO I HAD THE PLEASURE I NEVER MET HIM I HEWAS DEAD BEFORE I WAS BORN UM BUT MY MY DAD DID AND HE HAD GOOD FINEMEN STORIES AND THEY'RE INAPPROPRIATE UM SO THE COOL THING ABOUT FINEMEN RIGHT WAS THAT UM HE IDN'T REALLY CARE IF PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HE JUST WANTED PEOPLE TO GET TURNED ON TO HOW AMAZING PHYSICS WAS AND HE LOVE GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND ONE OF THE THINGS EU NOW THE EXAMPLE THATS SOMETIMES GIVEN OUT IN O HOW MANY YUR FAMILIAR WITH THE FINMEN BOOKS BUT SURELYOURE JOKING MISTER FIEMEN ORE WHAT YOU CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK ALL O THAT'S OF IT'S WONDERFUL HE PICKED LOCKS YOU KNOW WE WORKED AT LOST ALMOST LABS THEY'RE WORKING ON THE BAM AND HE BASICLYT WELL THERE AND ELSWHERE AND EVERY MORNING THE OFFICES USED TO COME IN AND HE WOULD SPREAD ALL THE TOP SECRET PAPERS OUT ON THE FLOOR HE'LD BREAK INTO THE SAFES AT NIGHT AND THEN THEY WERE PERPLEX WHO COULD DO THI HE LIKE SAFE CRACKING LITERALLY LIKE NATIONAL SCURITY SECRETS JUST FOR FUN PRANKSTER HE ALSO BONGO DRUM NAKED ON THE ROOF OF CALTAC AND HE DID MOST OF HIS WRITING OF THERUMS IN STRIP CLUBS FACT LEARN TO DRAW LATE IN LIFE WAS REALLY IN TO FLOTATION TANKS UM AND VERY CURIOUS ABOUT BUT NEVER DID PSYCHODELIC THAT'S TAS I UNDERSTAND BUT ONE OF THE THE COOL FINEMEN FACTOYDS IS THAT WHEN HE WAS A KID HE HE TALKED ABOUT WHEN HE WAS A CHILD THAT HAS DAD USED TO TAKE HIM BIRD WATCHING AND HE SAY ALL THAT'S A WHATEVER SCRUB JAY AND THAT'S A WHATEVER WHATEVER THRUSH AND THOT'S AND HIS DAD SAID NO DON'T CLOUD YOUR MIND WITH NAMING AND TAXIN ON ME THAT'S NOT MEANINGFUL BECAUSE THEN WHATD A IT'S THE DIFFERENT YOUKNOW THE PIGMY THRUSH OR THE THE LESSER THIS OR THAT THE MORE IMPORT THING IST TO START TO IDENTIFI PRINCIPLES OF HY CERTAIN BIRDS BEHAVE ONE WAY AND CERTAIN BIRDS BEHAVE ANOTHER AND TO START FINING THE THE COMMINALITIES AND THE REGULARITIES AND THAT'S A THEME THAT I OBVIOUSLY TONIGHT OF TRIED TO IMPOSE AND IT'S ACHALLY SOMETHING THAT I CAN'T DO IN POD CAST NECESSARILY CAUSE I CAN'T THREAD ACROSS FORTY EPISODES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE SAME WAY THAT I COULD IN AN EVENING LIKE THIS SO THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE FINEMEN STORY UM ALSO IT JUST EEM LIKE A DELIGHTFUL GUY AND HE'S CANNICOLI'S A LITTLE BIT STREET RITYA THE THICK ACCENT HE WAS FROM FAR ROCK WAY BUT HE DIDN'T REALLY CARE MUCH WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT OR HE DID AND HE PRETENDED HE DIDN'T CAREFUL WHEN PEOPLE TELL YOU THEY DON'T CARE WHAT PEOPLE THINK I THINK UM HE DID TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S STILL A LOW HIM TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT THERE O K NEXT QUESTION PLEASE MY HORSE W ELL OF THIS I DELIGHT IN ALL THINGS ANIMALS BUT A SPECIALLY HORSES BECAUSE MY HIGH SCHOOL GROFERING HAD A HORSE AN UM I YOU KOW THEY DO THAT THING WERE I PEOPLE OW YOU KNOW HORSES CAN DETECT HOW THEY KNOW MORE ABOUT YOU THAN YOU KNOW AND  I GEN TO THE HORSE IN THE HORSE LIKE ANY THTHE THIS AND LIKE IT'S LIKE A LITMOUS TEST I'VE MAI'T GROFOR IN WITH A HORSE WAS VERY INTIMIDATING FREMAIN ACTUALLY I FELT LIKE I HAD TO COMPETE WITH THE HORSE SHE SPEND ALL THIS TIME WITH THE HORSE IS VERY LARGE VERY LIKE YOU KNOW UM ANYWAY EVENTUALLY I BROKE THE HORSE THE UM OKE MY HORSE DOES THE DOUBLE IN HEAL LONG EXHAIL OFTEN HE'S A BIT OF A STRESSY GUY WARM BLOOD YE WARMBLOOD UM ICE TO WORK AT THE BARN YA I USED TO SHOVEL MANEURAN WORK AT THE BARN SHE BROUGHT HER HORSE TO COLLEGE THAT'S IGT I SHOULD FOLLOWED HER OFF TO CALLI NEVER WOULD HAVE GONE TO COLLEGE IF SHE HAD GONE TO COLLEGE UM AND THE HORSES ARE INTERESTING ANIMALS THEY DO TELL YOU LOT THE THE ORSE DOES THE DOUBLE IN HEALONG EXHAIL OFTEN HE'S A BIT OF A STRESSY GOD YOU SUPPOSE THI PHYSIOLOGICAL STREST REGULATOR TRANSENTS WE ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY IN FACT I MENTION WARM BLOOD SOR I'D HAVE A COLLEUE AT STAMFORD NA SHE'S AMAZING ER NAME IS SUMACONAL AND SHE IS AN EXPERT IN DOG CHINETICS S YOU CAN IMAGINE I'M ALWAYS ASKING HER QUESTIONS UM AND WE TALK ABOUT DOGS AND WE TALK ABOUT HORSES BECAUSE SHE ALLSO THINK SHE RAISES WARM BLOODS AND YOU HEAR ABOUT HOT BLOODS AND WARM BLOODS AND YOU ALSO IF YOU HAVE ANY FAMILIARITY WITH DOGS THEIR DOGS LIKE COSTELLO WE'RE LIKE A NEWCLIAR BOM COULD GO OFF AND COSTELL MI OPEN AN EYE THAT'S THE BULLDOG ECONOMY OF EFFORT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET ACTIVATED UNLESS THERE'S A REASON TO DO IT THEY ARE VERY AS WE CALL PARIS SYMPATHETIC DOMINANT THAT SE SAW OF AUTONOMIC AROWSAL IS JUST REALLY REALLY RELAXED GETTING THEM INTO ACTION IS MORE OF A MORE OF AN EFFORT THER'RE OTHER ANIMALS LIKE THE WHIPP IT RIGHT WE'RE THE ITALIAN GREYHOUND LIKE THEY LIS IT  LIKE HE'RE ALWAYS COLD THAT OR VERY SYMPATHETIC DOMINANT AND THEN A HORSE WITHIN A BREED OR WITHIN A SPECIES THERE'S A RANGE AND HUMANS ALSO OUT WITHIN A RANGE I THINK ANY ONE WHO'SE HAD SHILDREN WILL TELL YOU YOU KNOW HE OR SHE HAS BEEN LIKE THIS INS BIRTH CALM EASY GOING OR LIKE REALLY EASILY STRASSED I THINK THAT SEE SAW WEAN GET INTO TO NIGHT TOO MUCH BUT THERE'S A A CONCEPT WITH THE AUTONOMIC REGULATION OF OF A HINGE SO DON'T THINK SO MUCH ABOUT BEING REALLY STRESSED OUT OR REALLY RELAX BUT CERTAIN ANIMALS THE HINGEIS TIGHTEN SO THAT THE THE SE SAW JUST KIND OF TILT'S MELLO WIKE COSTELLO A BULL DOG IS ALMOST EEMS LIKE A DIFFERENT ANIMAL THEN A WHIP IT THER'E SO VERY DIFFERENT AND WITHIN THE THE CATEGRA HORSES I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN HORSE CENETICS BUT THEY ARE SELECTED FOR NOT JUST FOR THEIR PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES BUT FOR THERE PSYCHOLOGICAL OR TEMPERAMENT ATTRIBUTES AND YOU SEE THIS IN DOGS TO IN FACT THE REASON I PICKED COSTELLO AND ELVIS CAN VERIFY THE STORIES I READ I WANTED A DOG FOR SO MANY YEARS AND I WENT THERE AND THERE WERE ALL THESE PUPPIES AND I WAS I HEARD YOU NEED TO TAKE THEM IN THE OTHER ROOM AND ONE BY ONE AND IF IT BARKS FOR ITS SIBLINGS THAN YOU LIKE USS ETHY PUPPY SO WALKING AND ALL THE DOGS ARE RUNNING AROUND LIKE CRAZY WAS REGD AROUND CHRISTMAS TIME RANELVAS AND THE RUNNING ROUND AND THEN THERE'S ONE IN THE BACK AND HE'S TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT ALL THE OTHER ONES AR WEN HE'S JUST EATING OUT OF ALL THEIR MORS S I I WANT THAT ONE SO I TOOK THAT CHUBBY LITTLE BASTARD IN THE NEXT ROOM AND I THOUGHT O K HE'S GOING TO BARK FOR HIS SIBLINGS AN LAY DOWN AIN' TOOK A NAP NOS I THIS ONE I WANT THIS ONE WHY DID I WANT THAT ONE WILL THIS COMPLETE THE THE PRINCIPLE WHICH IS I WANTED A DOG LIKE THAT BECAUSE I'M NOT LIKE THAT AND I'M WAS VERY INTERESTED IN A DOG I COULD TAKE CARE OF BUT ALSO A DOG THAT WOULD HELPREGULATE MY NERVOUS SYSTEM AND SO FOR ME HAVING A DOG LIKE THAT AS OPPOSED TO A WHIP IT OR SOMETHING THAT WAS GETTING LIKE CONSTANTLY AROUND HIS IU A VERY CALMING EFFACT AND TO THIS DAY MEMORY OF HIS SNORING STILL PUTS ME TO SLEEP SO I THINK THAT YOURE YOUR HORSE PROBABLY HAW IT CONT IDOLS A LITTLE BIT HIGHERTHING ABOUT THE AR P M YOU KNOW REVSILO BIT HIGHER T A GIVEN HIER MORE OUR P M AT A GIVEN SPEED THAT'S WAY I THING ABOUT THE AUTONOMIC SYSTEM HOW D YOU RESET THAT WELL THIS IS WHY A LOT OF EXERCISE IS GOOD RIGHT IT'S AILING MY GIRL FRIEND'S HORSE WAS CRAZY IT WAS GILDED LATE AND IT WAS CRAZY ALMOST A NUTS BUT AT LIKE E AT PONSERIGHT IT WAS NOT NUTS BUT IT WAS CRAZY IT WAS GILDED LATE UM NEXT CRITION IS THERE ANY SCIENCE BEHIND STAING MOTIVATED OR DEVELOPING DISCIPLINE WO SO THIS REPRESENTS KIND OF THE HIGHER TEER OF WHERE I THINK THINGS ARE GOING TO GOING THE NEXT FOR YOURS WERE WE'RE GOING TO START SEEING THIS CONVERGENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY AND BIOLOGY WHERE WE CAN GET TO THESE HARDER CONCEPTS YOU KNOW I LIKE TO THINK THAT WE CAN STAY MOTIVATED THROUGH A SIMPLE PROCESS THAT NOW WILL MAKE SENSE TO YOU BECAUSE THE LAST THING I COVERED WAS TOGGLING BACK IND FORTH BETWEEN OURABILITY TO BE GRITTY AND LEAN IN COND OF INFRICTION MAYBE IN ALOLL ANGER FEAR COMPETITIVENESS ET CETERA THAT KOND OF EARN GRINDING IN BUT THAT THE MOR RE SUSTAINING FUEL THE SORT OF HYBRID VERSION RIGHT HIBRAD FUEL MOTTEL WOULD BE ONE IN WHICH YOU CAN ACCESS THAT BUT THAT'S A TOPLEADABLE AND NOT SO RENEWABLE RESOURCE WITHOUT A LOT OF REST MEANING WORKING HARD OUT OF ANGER DETERMINATION AND CAN A GRIT WILL WORK BUT WHEN YOU ARE DEPLEADED YOU HAVE TO STOP FOR A LONG WHILE WHEREAS IF YOU CAN ACCESS THIS DELIGHT SYSTEM WHICH IS REALLY ONE OF DOPAMENE AND SERATONEAN BOTH IN OTHER WORDS AND I WANT TO THINK OF A NOT OF A DIFFRENT WAY TO PUT THIS BUT TO TRYING THING ABOUT WHAT SORTS OF THINGS AND TOOLS ALLOW YOU TO BE AND FEEL MOST LOVING I KNOW IT SOUNDS WEAK BUT IT'S ANYTHING BUT WE TO BE MOST LOVING IN THE VERB SENSE OF THE WORD TOWARD WHAT YOU'RE DOING ACTUALL USED TO USE THIS TRICK IN COLLEGE WHEN I'D ENCOUNTER A TOPIC I HATED I WOULD TELL MYSELF I'M REALLY I'M JUSE IN A FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS BY TRYING TO FIND THE GEMS WITHIN IT SOMETIMES IT WORK SOMETIMES IT DIDN'T BUT THE WISH TO DO IT THAT WAY I SUPPOSE TO OCEAMGERS CAN A GRIND THIS OUT AT LEAST FOR ME AT THE TIME WAS A POWERFUL TOOL SO MOTIVATION AND DISCIPLINE IS A TRICKY ONE THAT SORT OF THAT JUST DO IT THING UM YOU NEED TOOLS TO MODULATE YOUR STRESS AND TO GET YOUR SLEEP YOU KNOW DO ALL THE BASIC THINGS RIGHT SET THE RIGHT CONTACT FOR YOU TO BE IN YOUR BEST CHANCE OF BEING DISCIPLINED AND THAT IT'S IT SELF IS ITS OWN FORM O DISCIPLINE BUT IN TERMS OF CONTINUAL MOTIVATION YOU'RE NOT IN O MANAGE TO GO AGAINST THE GRAIN FOR VERY LONG UM PEOPLE HAVE MANAGED TO GO AGAINST CHALLENGE FOR VERY LONG TIME FOR VERY LONG TIMES IN FACT I WAS READING RECENTLY ABOUT THE PSYCHOLEGY OF PEOPLE BEEN KIDNAPP AND THEY HAVE THIS ODD TRICK THAT THEY USED IF YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS IS SORT LIKE STOCKLUMS INDRUM BUT THEY ACTUALLY CONVINCE THEMSELVES TO FALL IN LOVE WITH THEIR CAPTORS AND THEN THEY COME UP WITH NEW WAYS TO ESCAPE THE SACANTACOOL U SO THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MENTALLY FEELING LIKE YOUR TRYING TO GO FROM BACK ON YOUR HEELS TO FLAT FOOTED IT DOES THAT'S VERY ENERGETICALLY COSTLY SO AGAIN THE THESE SYSTEMS ARE VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE WATWE CALL CONTACTS ARE TOPT DOWN REGULATION HOWFULLY THAT HELPS I KNOWNIT'S A LITTLE BIT ABSTRACT I WISH I COULD GIVE YOU ONE MINUTE EXERCISE OR MAKING MOTIVATED BUT O BUT WE TO TALK ABOUT TOOLS LIKE TOULD GET A DRENTALINE GOING AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT SPEND SOME TIME THINKING ABOUT WHAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO SUSTAIN EFFORT THROUGH POSITIVE FEELINGS IT'S NOT A LIGKE CONCEPT AT ALL O NEXT QUESTION PLEASE WHAT WOULD BE YOUR BIGGEST PIECE OF ADVICE FOR ACHIEVING ONE'S DREAMS BOY THAT'S A TOUGH ONE UM GAIN THIS IS GAME A LTLE ABSTRACT YOU KNOW I'M A BELIEVER IN THIS IDEA OF A KIND OF A SEED MESSAGE UM ROBER GREEN IS TALKED A LOT ABOUT THIS UM THAT WE CAN ALL KIND OF THINK BACK TO A EVENT OR STAGE OF OUR LIFE TYPICALLY IT'S UM BEFORE PUBERTY FOR OTHER REASONS THAT OUR KIND OF INTERESTING BUT WHERE WE WE DELIGHT IN SOMETHING RIGHT IT' SO FOR ME IT WAS FISH AND O LY SEE NOW I DON'T NEED TO WORK ON FISH IT'S IT WASN'T ABOUT THE FISH I HOPE THAT CAME THROUGH I ME A QUERIOR REALLY COOL BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE FISH IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY THEY MOVED IT WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY THAT IT TICKLED MIGHT EXCITEMENT I EASE GET DROPPED OFF AT THIS OTTLE PETSHOP IN CALIFORNIAAVENUE POLL TO CALLED MONI'S PETSHOP MY MOMUSES CHILD CARRAGE YOU DROP ME OFF THERE AND I THIS BOOK AND I WOULD LOG ALL THE TROPICAL FISH AND WHICH ONES COULD BE WITH WHICH ONES AND THEN I WOULD I WAS OBSESSED RIGHT BUT FOR ME IT WAS SOMETHING ABOUT ORGANIZING AND BEING ABLE TO MAKE RELIABLE PREDICTIONS IT WAS ABOUT PARSIMONY IT WAS ABOUT PRINCIPLES AS OPPOSED TO EN THE COLOR'S DELIGHTED ME IN ALL THAT KIND OF STOK IT THE EQUIPMENT TOLIGHTEN ME BUT THEN I AT PUBERITY ANEN LIKE IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE AND UM AND THEN I WENT TO COLLEGEIN IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE AND I GOT GIR VOR IN IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE SO IT CHANGES OVER TIME BUT THIS IS WHY I RECOMMENDED TO THAT YOUNG FIFTEEN YEAR OLD PERSON THAT THEY LEARN TO TAP INTO THAT SENSE OF LIKE LIKE THIS IS COOL LIKE THIS FEELS I KNOW NOT EVERYONE ELSE THINKS AT SCHOOL MAYBE THEY DO LIKE THIS FEELS GOOD I ACTUALLY HAVE OF SOMMATIC EXPERIENCE OF THIS I'M NOT A VERY SOMATICALLY ORIENTED PERSON I MORE UP HERE BUT I ACTUALLY C KNOW IF I'M ON TO SOMETHING IF THIS LEFT ARM JUST KIND OF STARTS FIDGETING LIKE IT'S LIKE I WANT A MOVE OR IT LIKE SOME PEOPLEL YOU CAN START TO IDENTIFY WAYS IN WHICH YOU SUDDENLY HAVE THIS POSITIVE ENERGY IT'S NOT A FEAR ENERGY IT'S ALMOST LIKE A MAGNETISM TO THINGS AND JUST DON'T BE CONFUSED AND OR MIS DIRECTED IN THINKING THAT IT'S THAT THING IT'S THAT I YEN ENERGY OR THAT ATTRACTION TO SOMETHING THAT FEELS RIGHT THAT IS YOUR YOU KNOW I WISH WE HADE THESE DIVINING ROD TO FIND WATER THAT'S YOUR TOOL IT'S LIKE UNTEN I YOU WANT A GROW YOUR AND TEN I SO HOW DO YOU FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS WI I NEVER THOUGHT I DO A PODCAST I NEVER THOUGT'D BECOME A NORROW SCIENTIST YOU YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING COURSE TO TAKE RISKS AND UM AND TO ITERATE QUICKLY BUT NOT SO QUICKLY THAT YOU YOU KNOW YOU FAIL OUT OF THE GAME ET CETERA IF YOU DO GET BACK IN ET CETERA BUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT DEVELOPING IN AWARENESS NOW THE KEYTHING IS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIND THIS BY GOING UP A MOUNTAIN AND SITTING THERE OR WAITING FOR YOUR PASSION TA JUST KIND OF ROCKET BEOU NOW TOS TIS SORT PIANO FALL ONDER YOUR HEAD IT'S NOT CIN I HAPPEN THAT WAY YOU HAVE TO INTERRACT WITH THE SENSORY WORLD AND DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE AND YOU HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF A ADVENTURER IN A SAFE WAY OF COURSE AN ADVENTURER AND LEARN TO RECOGNIZE THE SIGNALS AND SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY INTUNE WITH US THEM THE OTHER'S IN AMAZING PODCASTS WITH RIREUBEN RECENTLY ON JOROGANS PODASTSERY TALKS ABOUT THE CREATIVE PROCESSES KIND OF THIS WY IT SEEMS LIKE WHATEVER'S GOING ON IN THAT BEAR TO HIS IS CONNECTS TO THE WORLD AND HE CAN JUST LIKE THERE LIKE THAT'S WHERE YOU NEED TO GO AND THAT'S YOU KNOW BUT THAT'S PART OF THE MAGIC IS YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW AN BECAUSE IT'S IT'S ALL ENERGETIC IT'S ALL ENERGETIC AND WHEN I SAY ENERGETIC I DON'T MEAN IN THE MISTICAL SENSE I MEAN YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO SENS THOSE FLUCTUATIONS AND ENERGIES SOME PEOPLE CAN SENDS THEM VERY EASILY BECAUSE THEI'R VERY MELLOW AN IF SOMETHING GETS REALLY EXCITED THEY NOTICE AS A BIG DELTA AS WE SAY INCI BIG CHANGE OTHER PEOPLE THEY RIDE KUNT A HIGH ALL THE TIME AND SO EVERYTHINGIS EXCITING TO THEM AND THEY MISS A LOT OF THSE SUBTLE FLUCTUATIONS IN WHAT'S REALLY SPECIAL AND RIGHT FOR THEM IN FACT MANIA IT'S CHARACTERIZE BY HYPER ELEVATED LEVELS OF DOPENMING AND EVERYTHING'S A GOOD IDEA RIGHT AND DEPRESSION IS THE OPPOSITE NOTHING'S A GOOD IDIA NOTHING'S GON TO WORK RIGHT AND THOSE ARE THE EXTREMES AND THOSE ARE ROUGH CONDITIONS OBVIOUSLY BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE IT'S ABOUT LEARNING TO DETECT THOSE SUBTLE FLUCTUATIONS AN EVERY TIME EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU FIND SOMEBODY WHO IS EXCEPTIONAL AT THEIR CRAFT EN DOING WELL IN LIFE OOK CAN A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE EXCEPTIONAL THEIR CRAFT BUT NOT NECESSARILY DOING WELL ON THE WHOLE THOSE PEOPLE HAVE A KIND OF A INTUITION ABOUT WHAT FEELS GOOD TO THEM THIS HERE'S NOBLE PRIZE WHEN HER IN CHEMISTRY IS MY COLLY CAROLIN BURTOSY AND ALL I KNOW OF HER EXCEPT THE FACT THAT SHE'S AMAZING CHEMIST IS THEY DID THIS INTERVIEW WITH HER AND SHE SAID THAT WHEN EVERYONE GO OUT AND COLLEGE SHE WAS FINDING EXCUSES TO STAY HOME AND READ ORGAN AT CHEMISTRY NOW AD TO ME SOMETHING A BAD NIGHT BUT FOR HER IT WAS PURE DELIGHT AND SHE'S WIRED FOR THAT AND TI THINK HER WORK IS GOING TO BE VITALLY IMPORTANT AND TRANSFORMATIVE FOR HUMANITY I REALLY DO SO HOW DO YOU SUCCEED IN IN GET CHASING YOUR DREAMS YOU SUCCEED IN IDENTIFYING WHAT THEY ARE BUT YOU DON'T KNOW AT THE OUTSET YOU WANT A FINED THE ENERGY TO FIND THE RIGHT PATH AND CONTINUALLY COURSE CORRECT WHEN YOU WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE OFF YOUR PATH THAT'S THE SUMCHY WHAT I'VE DONE I'V STILL LOOK FOR THE FEELING OF DELIGHTING IN COSTELLO OR THE CUBTLE FISH THAT'S WHAT I'M AM LOOKING FOR IT'S NOT A TEMPLET I HAVE TO MATCH BUT THAT'S MY LIKE OYA I KNOW WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE IT'S LIKE A TEXTURE IT'S LIKE IF YOU THING ABOUT A BUNCH OF DIFERENT TEXTURIES OF SAND PAPER IT'S LIKE THIS ONE THAT JUST FEEL REALLY GOD AND SO YOU'RE COMPARING EVERYTHING TO THAT IT CAUS THE SYSTEM THAT INVOLVES ALL THESE CHEMICALS YOU'LL FIND IT IF YOU LEARN TO PAY ATTENTION TO IT BUT YOU WON'T FIND IT SITTING STARING AT YOUR BELLYBUTTON ER LOOK GOING UP AMOUNT YOU HAVE TO BE INCENSORY EXPERIENCE IN ORDER TO FIND IT REFLECTION IS GOOD BUT YOU NEEN TO GET INTO ACTION OK AALL RIGHT WELL UM O K SO AM SYLICIBAN A OPINION OF THE PSYCHODELICS GENERALLY WE JUS SAD AN EPISODE WITH MY CHOLIC NOLIN WILLIAMS WHOSE A TRIPLEBOARD CERTIFIED NEROLOGIS PSYCHIADRIS IS A FUNTHING ABOUT WORKING AT STAMFORD IS ALSO VERY HUMBLING CAUSE YOU'RE LIKE WHAT WERE THESE PEOPLE UM THAT THREEBOARD CERTIFICATIONS YOU KNOW THAT THE SYLICIBAN FIRST WHILE NOT FOR EVERYBODY PEOPLE WITH PSYCHOSIS IT IS STILLY LEGAL DECRIMINALIZED CERTAIN PLACES YOU KNOW SO OBVIOUSLY THE CAUTIONARY NOTES OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE DRUGGADICTION ISSUES OR OTHER KINDS OF EDICTION ISSUES NEED TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT DIVING INTO A NARROW CHEMICAL LANDSCAPE LIKE THAT BUT IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE THAT THE CLINICAL TRIALS ON ONE MACKRO DOSE THIS IS WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME ALOPULE TOK ABOUT MICRODOSING SYLISIVON BUT THE DATA AT LEAST ACCORDING TO MATTHEW JOHNSON WHO IS ALSO ON THE PODCAS THE DATA FOR MICRODOSIG ARE NOT REALLY THERE FRANKLY THE DATA ON SINGLE SESSION MACKRODOSE THE SORT OF HEROIC DOSES THAT HAVE BEN TALKED ABOUT IN THE PSYCHIC THE PSYCHONOT COMMUNITY FOR DEPRESSION AND TO SOME EXTENT PTST AND FOR EATING DISORDERS AND FOR ANLAEND UM SORT OF END OF LIFE PREPARATION ARE QUITE ENCOURAGING IN FACT THE CURRENT DATA SUGGESTED ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF PEOPLE ACHIEVE LASTING RELIEF FROM ONE SESSION NOW KEEP IN MIND THOSE ARE GUIDED SESSIONS WITH PHYSICIONS IN THE ROOM ET CETERA I DO THINK THERE'S A POTENTIAL HAZARD OF ALL PSYCHODELICS WHICH IS THEY ALTERR THIS INCLUDES EMD MA OR ESPECIALLY MDI MAT THEY ALTER THE CHEMICAL LANDSCAPE IN YOU SUCH THAT A LOT OF THINGS CAN SERVE AS A TRACTORS IN THAT STATE MEANING YOU CAN GET REALLY INTO THE SOUND OF MUSIC IN AN EMDIMASESSION FEEL CONNECTED TO THAT AND WASTE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME MORE MEANINGFUL TRANSFORMAT IVERY WIRING AND I I DO THINK THAT THAT'S WORTH PAYING ATTENTION TO SO THAT'S THE THE THE USEFULNESS OF HAVING AT THEIR APEUTIC GUIDE THERES THEY CAN CONTINUALLY STEER YOU BACK TO WHAT AT LEAST FOR YOU IS THE MORE MEANINGFUL WORK BUT IT'S VERY ENCOURAGING AND NOLIN WILLIAMS WHO I TRUST THIS AN AGAIN TRIUBLE BOARD CERTIF IED EMDY SAID TH IN THE STUDIES OF LIFETIME PERCEIVED INDIVIDUAL IN SOCIETAL RISK OF ALL THE COMPOUNDS OUT THERE EXCEPT FOR CAFINE SYLICIVON IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST WHEREAS THINGS LIKE IN A HEROINE COCANE ALCAL HALL O METHEM PHEDAMAN SAID AT THE TOP OF TA LIST A SHE A'LCALL QUITE HIGH ON THAT LIST AT CERTAIN MOUNTS OF CONSUMPTION I'M VERY EXCITED UM ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE LANDSCAPE OF SYLICIVON BUT I'M NOT SO EXCITED ABOUT THE MICRODOSING DATA VERY EXCITE ABOUT THE SINGLE HEROIC DOSE DATA A ONE INTERESTING THEIR THING THEIRE PERHAPS WHAT SEEM IS TO BE THE UNIFING FEATURE OF A SUCCESSFUL SYLLICIL SYLICIBONS GUVES ME SESSION IS THAT AT SOME POINT THE PERSON FEELS AS IF IT LIKE TOO MUCH OF A AUTONOMIC THING THEY IT CUT GET TO THIS POINT AND THEN THEY ARE ENCOURAGE TO COTINC LET GO AND I'M FASCINATED BY THIS CONCEPT OF LETTING GO BECAUS YO MANORO SCIENCIS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS BUT SEEMS LIKE BEING ABLE TO RIDE THE WAVE OF OF AUTONOMIC ARALSAL FROM TOP TO BOTTOM SEEMS TO BE VERY POWERFUL FOR TROMAAN DEPRESSION TREATMENT AND THIS IS INTERESTING A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES IN HUMANS NOWADAYS IS WERE STRESSED ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS BUT WE NEVER ACTUALLY GET TO GO INTO THE FULL STRESS RESPONSE AND THEN LET IT RELAX AGAIN UM AND CATHARSIS WAS BIG AT ONE POINT YOU KNOW SCREAM THERAPISTEVE JOBSING TO SCREAM THERRAPIES THAT WHETHER NOT CATHARSIS IS HEALTHY OR NOT AS BEEN DEBATED BUT UM THE DATE ARE CO POINTING THE FACT THAT IT MAY BE PROVIDED THAT THE CATHARSIS IS NOT OBVIOUSLY SO ON DAMAGING THEMSELF FOR SOMEBODY ELSE UM SO MAYE WESH LL BE SCREAMING LLOTMORE WHY DOEST MY DESIRE TO EAT DISAPPEAR AFTER I USE THE SANA OF INTERESTING I CAN GO IN HUNGRY AND GET OUT WITH NO DESIRE TO EAT U I CAN ONLY SPECULATE YOU KNOW THE SANA OR ANY KIND OF DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE THAT'S UNCOMFORTABLE RELEASES THES MOLECULE DYING ORPHAN IS AC TALLY THE SAME MOLECULE THAT'S RELEASED IN  UNDER CONDITIONS OF ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL I MAKES YOU FEEL AGITATED AND NOT GOOD AND THEN THERE'S THIS REBOUND BUT THE WAY IT FEELS GOOD IS LATER IT CAUSES THIS UPREGULATION IN THE SO CALL MULEPIOID RECEPTORS SO YOUARE THE CHEMICALS THAT YOU HAVE YOUR SO CALED INDOGENOUS OPIOID'S NOT THAT OPIOIDS THAT IE RELATE O THE OPRIOD CRISIS BUT THE ONES THAT YOU NATURALLY MAKE ARE ABLE TO HAVE A MORE ROBUST OF FACT AFTER THE SANA DINORPHAN IS AN APPETITES SUPPRESSIN UM AND FOR REASONS RELATED TO KIND OF GENERAL DISCOMFORT IN THE BODIE SO THAT'S THE ONLY REASON I CAN SPECULATE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS THAT SANA DOES INCLUDING MASSIVE INCREASES IN GROWTHORNMONE PROVIDED YOU DON'T SANA TOO MUCH SO IFYOU DO AT ONCE A WEEK FOR FOUR TWENTY MINUTE SESSIONS SPACE FIVE MINUTES APART U YOU GET THESE ENORMOUS INCREASES IN GROWTHORMONA IF YOU START DOING IT MORE OFTEN YOU GET STILL SIGNIFICANT BUT SMALLER INCREASES IN GROWTHORMON AND MY TEAM THIS IS HOW THE PODCAS GOES TO AT SOME POINT ROUB JUST GOESE IT'S ENOUGH SO IF YOU THNK THAT THE EPISODES ARE LONG NOW THEY'D BE A LOT LONGER LISTN'T I JUST WANT IT AM BEFORE WE PART I KNOW IT'S A SUNDAY NIGHT AND PEOPLE HAVE TO GO I WANT TO THINK EVERYONE FOR COMING OUT TO NIGHT I KNOW THAT UM AT LEAST FOR ME I'M STILL SORT OF A BAFFLED BUT PLEASANTLY SO THAT PEOPLE IM INTERESTIN INVESTING TIME TO COME OUT AND HERE A HOURS OF A A NERD LIKE ME TALK ABOUT SCIENCE AND TOOLS AND I'M DELIGHTED THAT PEOPLE ARE HOPEFULLY GLEANING SOME USEFUL INFORMATION PLE ESE TWO PASS ALONG THE INFORMATION I DIDN'T INVENT THIS STUFF AS I MENTIOND BEFORE I WAS NOT CONSULTED THE DESIGN PHASE I HAVE NO DOMAIN OVER IT THIS IS THE STUFF OF MOTHER NATURE WHATEVER OTHER BELIEFS YOU HAVE THEY'RE HERE IN US OF COURSE I BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T FINISH BY SAYING HAVE A WONDERFUL NIGHT AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN SCIENCE

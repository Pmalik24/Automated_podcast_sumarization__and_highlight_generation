THOSE ARE THOSE ARE REALLY REALLY AWFUL NUMBERS AS FAR AS THE CHOIC IS IN A TWENTY TWENTY REE MATS REGISTERED VOTERS ARE CURENTLY SPLIP BETEEN TRUMPET BIDE THE'VE GOT TRUMP UP FORTY SEVEN FORTY SIX OVER JOBIDON IN THESE IN THIS POLE NOW THROUGH THE REAL DECLINE FOR BIDON THERE IS AMONG MYNORITY VOTERS AND THIS IS WHY I THINK THIS POLE AND A LOTIPOLES LIKE IT AR CIND OF A CHIMERA I THINK THAT THEI'R LOT OF POLSRGHT NOW THAT YE'RE SHOWING BIDON AT BAD NUMBERS BECAUS THEIR LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THEY'RE WAVERING ABOUT JOBIDON BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THOSE VOTERS ARE GOING TO STAY ON T E SIDE LINES OR FLIP TO DONAL TRUMPLE EXPLAINER I MEAN BY THAT IN JUST ONE SECOND FIRST IS YOUR SULPHONE INDUSTPERATNEN OF REPLACEMENT YOU KNOW THE BATTERY IS DYING LIKE EVERY FIVE SECONDS IF TO

AT FORTY SIX PER CENT THERE'S SOME OTHER NUMBERS BAKED INTO THAT CAKE THAT I'M NOT CERTAIN ARE GOING TO MAINTAIN UP UNTIL THE ELECTION SO IN OTHEWORDS HE IS CERTAINLY RUNNING WEEK HE'S CERTAINLY A VERY VERY WEEK REELECT CANDIDATE I THINK THAR A LOT O VOTERS OUT THERE WHO ARE GOING TO QUOTINQUOTE COME HOME PURE'S WHAT I MEAN BIDON RIGHT NOW SEE'S A MAJORITY OF SUPPORT AMONG VOTERS OF COLLOR AT FIFTY EIGHT PER CENT HEIS NOT GOING TO IN VOTERS OF COLOR AT FIFTY A PER CEN HE'S GOING WHEN VOTERS OF COLOR AT SEVENY PER CENT THE REASON I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST ELECTION CYCLE UN TWENTY TWENTY HE WON NINETY TWO PER CENT OF THE BLACK VOT HE LOST THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT OF TH HIS VANIC VOTE SO HE HE WON THE HIS VANIC VOTE LIKE FIFTY NINE PER CENT OF HIS PANIC VOTE HE ONE SEVENTY TWO PER CENT OF THE ATION VOTE IN T E LAST ELECTION CYCLE SO NONE OF THE SUBGRUPS ARE COMING IN AT FIFTY IGHT PER CENTER BELOW TWO ASSUME THAT ALL OF THEM ARE GOING TO COMIN COLLECTIVELY AT FIFTY EIGHT PER CENT I FIND THAT VERY VERY DOULL TO BELIEVE NO DEMOCRAT HAS LOST MORE THAN ABOUT THIRTY PER CENT OF MY NORITY VOTE FOR PROBABLY TWO GENERATIONS SO THE NOTION THAT THIS IS GOIN TO BE THE TIME WHEN TH NUMBERS TO SHIFT DRAMATICALLY IN FAVOR OF DONALD TRUM I'VE A HARD TIME BELIEVING THAT THAT'S THE CAIVVHN THER A LOT PEOPLE AR SANG NAT THAT ATARONTOLL POLLSTRM E VOTE FOR BITIN SON AT LIKE HIM VERY MUCH BUT IF FORCE TO THE JORIS I THINK THERE CAN BE A LOT OF VOTERS WHO QUOTQUOTE COME HOME WHICH IS AGAIN WHY I THINK THAT COUNTS ER IN TUITIVELY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS THAT IS STRENGTHENING BIDON IS DONAL TRUMPS CANDIDACY MAN IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT THAT JOBIDON CAN'T TURN OUT VOTERS FOR HIMSELF NOBODY LIKE CHOBINOR CARESABOUT TOBIDING JOBIDING LITERALLY RAN A CAMPAIGN AS A CORPSE LAST TIME HE'SGOING TO DO THE SAME TIME THIS THIS TIME EXCEPT HE'S AN OLDER CORPS IN A WEEL AM OUT HE'S GOING A GO FROM HIS FACE HOLE AND THEN THEREG A REEL IN BACK DOWN OFTHE BASEMEN IN DELAWARE AN THAT'S CON BE IS ENTIRE CAMPAIGNS I CKAN IS BATETRUMP HE'S NOT CIN DO IT MONOE MONO COMBAT WOITH TRUMP NOT NOTHING HEIS GOING TO SIT ON THE SIDELINES AND WAIT FOR DONAL TRUMP TO BE THE CENTR OF A TENTION IT' GON EBE EXACT CEM CAMPAIGN AS LAST TIME NOW DO YOU THINK THAT FULLY TEN TO TWELVE PER CENT OF MY NORTY VOTERS ARE GOING TO SHIFT T OVER FROM JOBIDON TO DONAL TRUMP I'VE A VERY HARD TIME BELIEVING THOSE DAFTS HE STILL SEES A MAJORITY  SUPPORT AMONG COLLEGE GRABUETS AT FIFTY SIX PER CENT FIFTY FIVE PER CENT AMONG VOTERS YOUNGER THAN THIRTY FIVE FIFTY THREE PER CENT OF WOMEN DONALD TRUMP HAS MAJORITY SUPPORTIN THE SIAN AN POLE AMONG WHITE AMERICANS MEN FIFTY THREE PER CENT VOTERS WITH OUT A COLLEGE TO GREE FIFTY THREE PER CENT INDEPENDENT VOTERS ARE STILL BREAKING AND BIDON'S FAVORTE FORTY SEVEN TO THIRTY EIGHT SO TO SUBERBAN WOMAN FIFTY ONE TO FORTY FOUR SO AGAIN I'M HAVING A HARD TIME SEEING THE PATH TO VICTORY IN THOSE NUMBERS BECAUSE IT SEEMS S TO ME THAT IF I NDEPENDENT VOTERS ARE SPLITTING FORTY SEVEN TO THIRTY EIGHT AND ALL THE DEMOCRATS ARE VOTING AGAINST TRUMP ANDALL THE REPUBLICANS ARE VOTING FOR TRUMP I I DON'T KNOW HOW TRUMP IS ABLE TO PULL OUT OF VICTORY UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES AGAIN TRUMP'S HIGH WATER MARK IS THIS PULL AT FORTY SEVEN PER CENT COULD HE WINAN ELECTION WITH FORTY SEVEN PERSENT HIM AN HE DID IN SWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BUT IT WAS THE TIGHTEST RUMTHING EVER MEN HE LITERALLY HE LOST THE POPULAR VOD AND HE WAS ABLE TO WIN THE VOTES IN PRECISELY THE RIGHT PLACES IS THAT HISTORY GOING TO REPEAT ITSELF IN THE SELECTION CYCLE IRONICALLY AGAIN JOBIDON'S BAD POLL NUMBERS ARE ACTUALLY HELPING HIM IN SORT OF A PRACTICAL CENTS THEY'RE ELEVATING DONALD TRUMPIN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY BECAUSE IT'S MAKING TRUMP SEEM VERY ELECTABLE AGAINST BIDON SA LOT OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS WHO LOVE TRUMP ON A PERSONAL LEVEL THER'E LIK ON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN WINNING AND VOTNING FOR THE GUYLIKE IN THE PRIMARY LOOK AT TH BOLES THAT'S TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE I GET IT IN MAKE SENS RIMINLIGHT TRUMP IN THIS POLE IS ACTUALLY RUNNING THE SAME AS RONISANTIS THE SANSIS IS IS RUNNING HAD TO HAD AGAINST BIDIN AT FORTY SEVEN FORTY SEVEN SO BASICALLY OF THE SAME NUMBERS SO IF YOU'RE A A TRUMP FANED HIHD LOVE THE GUIDE AND SOMEBODY SAYS TOU WILL IS NOT ELECTABLE THE'RE NO LOOK AT THESPONE THER CAN O GO WELL I MEAN WHO IS HE'S RUNNING THE SAME AS ALL THE OTHER RE PUBLICANS HE BASICALLY RUNS LIKE DFALLT RE PUBLICAN SO I CANT I HAVE MY CAKAN EETO TO A VOTE FOR THE GUYJUY LOVAN IS ENTERTAINING AND DID GOOD THINGS FOR ME LAST TIME AROUND AND IS A GIANT MIDDLE FINGER IT'S THE LEFT AND HE CAN WIN JUST AS EASILY AS ANY OTHER REPUBLICAN WHEN I'M TELLING YOUS I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY TRUE BUT I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE DATE OF T IT'S BEING PRESENTED ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THAT'S ACTULLY HELPING BIDON BECAUSE IF YOU BELIEVE AS I DO THAT JOBIDON'S LARGE ADVANTAGE AND VOTER TURN OUT COMES SOLELY AS A RESULT OF PEOPLE HATING DONAL TRUMP WELL THAT'S GOOD FOR BIDON THE OTHER THNG THITS GOOD FOR BIDON ABOUT THESE BAD POLE NUMBERS IS THAT ONE OF THE TINGS THAT REALY HURT HILLERY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AGAINST TRUMP THE FIRST TIME ONE OF THNGS THAT REALLY HURT HER WAS AN ASSUMPTION BY LITERALLY EVERY ONE THAT SHOS CAN WALKWAY AT THE ELECTION THAT WAS THE BASETINEIS SUMPTION OF VIRTUALLY EVERYONE YOU REMEMBER THA THE FAMOUS NEW YORK TIME'S NEEDLE THAT SHOWED THE BEGINNING OF THE IGHT A NINETY NINE PER CENT PUBLABILITY THAT HILLERY CLINT WAS CAN BE PRESIDENT AND BY THE END OF THE NIGHT OF COURSE ON AL TRUMP WAS PRESIDENT YOURMEMBER THIS SO BECAUSE EVERY ONE THOUGHT HILLERY WAS GOING TO WIN NO ONE SHUT UP TO VOTE FOR HER ALL THESE VOTERS IN WISCONSIN PENNSYLVANIA MICHIGAN ALL THESE VOTERS WELLIKE HILLER ISK IN A WIN ANYWAY AND IT'S IT'S COLD OUTSIDE AND I DON'T LIKE OR THAT MONCH I'M SKEN A STAY HOME AND SO DONAL TRMP WAS ABLE TO SNEAK BY MY FAVORITE STAFF FROM THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION THAT THAT PROVES THIS OUT IS THAT IN WISCONSIN WHICH DONALD TRUMP ONE BY A FAIR LY DECENT MARGIN IN WISCONSIN DONALD TRUMP IN TWENTY SIXTEEN ONE FEWER ABSOLUTE VOTES THAN MIT ROMNEY DID IN TWENTY TWELVE BUT MEN ROMY LOST THE STATE BECAUSE BORAKO BAMA GOT THE VOTE OUT FOR HIS SIDE AN HILLERY CLINTON LOST THE STATE IN WHICH IN WHICH YHO'S RUNNGAGINST TO PERSENT GOT FEWER VOTES THAM IT ROMNEY DID IN WIS CONSEN IT IT W THE THE TWENTY SIXTEEN WAS ELECTION WAS REFLECTION OF TWO THINGS PEOPLE DIN LIKE HILLER CLIN AND THEY THOUGHT FOR SHIRSHOS CAN WIN WELL THE FIRST IS STILL TRUTER PEOPLE DON'T LIKE JOBIDON BUT THEY ARE CERTAINLY NOT SURE THAT HE IS GOING TO WIN AND THAT MEANS THAT IF YOU AREN' UN CERTAIN AND SIKE GET YOUR ASS OUT OF THE CHAIR ON VOTER DAY AND AND I GO DO THE THING THE VOTER TURN OUT IS NOT ON TO BE AS LOWS AT WHAT IS ON CAN TO BE AS HIGH AS IT WAS LAST TIME BECAUSE LAST TIME WAS IN SAYING WITH ALL THE MAILAND BALLADING AND ALL OF THE HUBOB AND THE BEALEMRIETS IN AND THE COVI N EVERYTHING BUT IS I CAN BE AS LOW AS IT WAS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN ALOT OF THESE PLACES EITHER FRM DEMOCRATS NATE SO WHAT IS THIS UTTHI THIS IS GIVING REASON FOR DEMOCRATS TO PANIC BYTHO ASHOULD AS SHUL GIVE YOU THE ACTUAL STAFTS HERE WITH REGARD TO HOW HOW BIDON RUNS GANS VARIOUS OF THE REPUBLICANS SO TRUMP IS U IS RUNNING AS WE SAY FORTY SEVEN FORT SIX OVERBIDEN IN THIS VOL WHICH IS MARGIN OF ARR EFFECTIVELYTHER TIDE THEY'RE FORTY HE'S A FORTY SEME PER CENT TO FORTY SOME PERSCENT AGAINST RONOSANTIS HE IS DOWN TWO TO MY PENTS FORTY SIX TO FORTY FOUR HE'S DOWN TWO TO TIM SCOTT FORTY SIX TO FORTY FOUR HE IS UP ONE AGAINST THE VAKE ROMASUAMY FORTY SIX TO FORTY FIVE AND HE'S ESUUE DOWN TWO TO CRISS CHRISTY FORTY FOUR TO FORTY TWO CHRISTY OVER BIDON NICKY HAYLEYIS DEALING WITH A CLEARLEAD SHE HAS A FORTY NINE TO FORTY THREELAD N A HYPOTHETICAL MATCH UP BETWEEN THE TWO ACCORDIG TO SEANEN THT DIFFERENCE IS DRIVEN AT LEASTIN PART BY BROUGHTER SUPPORT FOR HAYLEY THAN FOR OTHE REPUBLICANS AMONG WHITE VOTERS WITH COLLEGE DEGREES WHICH WHICH MAKES HIM CENSES RIGHT ALL THESE OTHER CANDIDATES A RUNNING FOR THE EXACTS HIM CRAB THAT TRUMP GOT NICKY HAYLEY DOES HAVE SOME SOR WHITE COLL OR APPEAL THAN MANY OF THESE OTHER CANDIDATES DO NOT THE DEMOCRATIC COALITION IS WHITE COLLEGE EDUCATED VOTERS AND MYNORITIES THAT IS THAT IS THEIR COALITION AND THE REPUBLICAN COALITION IS WHITE NON COLLEGE EDUCATED VOTERS AND A BEVY OF S  CRISOR PARSHAL PARSHAL LEGIONS FROM VARIOUS MYNORTY GROUPS THAT IS HIGHER THAN IT HAS BEEN UNDER PRIOR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES SO IF IF HE CAN CARVE AWAY SOME THE WHITE COLLEGE EDUCATE A GROUP OR SOME OF THE WOMEN OR SOME THE INDEPENDENT VOTERS REPUBLICANS HAVE A GOOD SHOT AD VICTORY RIGHT NOW REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING HE ARE MORE DEEPLY DRIVEN TO VOTE IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SEVENTY ONE PER CENTS THEY E ARE EXTREMELY MOTIVATED DEMOCRATIC LINE VOTE OR SIXTY ONE PER CENTS SHAY THE ARE EXTREMELY MOTIVATED AND THIS'S AGAIN WHY I THINK THAT THIS POLE IS CON VACHIMARA I DON'T THINK THAT GAP IS GOING TO EXIST ON ELECTIONDAY I THEN WHEN HE GET TO ELECTIONS DAY AFTER MONTH AND MONTHS AND MONTHS OF DEMOTRUMP IS ON TRIAL DONAL TRUMP IS A FATIOS DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO DESTROY THE WORLD DEMOCRATIC VOTOTURN OUT IN TWENTY EIGHTTEEN IN TWENTY TWENTY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO HAS BEEN VERY VERY GOOD DEMOCRATIC VOTITURN OUT HAS NOT LAGGED IN ANY ELECTIONS SINCE DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN ON THE BALLAT OR IN THE SHADO WABEEN ON THE BALLAT SO DO I THINK THAT A LOT OF DEMOCRATIC VOTERS ARE JUS GOINGTO GET BORD EN STAY HOME I I HAVE SERIOS TOTS PUT AGAIN THESE POLES CONTER IN TUTIVELY MAY BE ACTUALLY HELPING BIE NOT A PRACTICAL LEVEL DEMOCRATS HOWEVER ARE PANICS ANDWI GET T THAT DEMOCRATIC PANIC IN  JUST ONE MOMENT FIRST I'VE BEEN ON THE ROAD OBVIOUSLY THET MEANS NOT AS

MATTRESSORTERS TWO FREEPOES FROM ILESTERS GO TO HULIC SLEEP DOT CONSFLESHMEN YOU'SE COT HULICS PARTNER TWHENTY FIVE IT' THEIR BEST OFLFR GET SOMETHING TO LAST LONG WITH HULICS BETTER SLEEP STARTS RIGHT NOW O' GATE SO  DEMOCRATS AT LOOK AT THIS POLE AND THEYARE FREEKING OUT YOU CAN SEE THE MEMBERS THE MEDIA OR BASICALLY BEGGING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY PLEASE RUN SOMEBODY ELSE NOW AGAIN BIZARLY WE NOW HAVE AGREEMENT BETWEN THE TWO PARTIES ON ONE FUNAMENTAL PRINCIPLE THERE'S NOWAY CAN LOSE TO THAT  THAT'S THE FUN MENTAL PRINCIPLE REPELLGANS LIKE NO WAY WE LOSE TO THIS DOTTERING OLD JERRIATRIC MORE ON NO WAY WE OOSE TOTHIS CORRUPTO CRAT NO WAY AN DEMOCRAT TOR LOKING IT DOWN FROM IT NO WAY WE LOSE TO A GUY WHO'S UNDER FOUR SEPARATE INVITEMENTS BEFORE THE ELECTION AND A GOIT WHO PARTICIPATEIN

ACTUALLY PANICING FIRST WHICH IS INTERESTING AND AGAIN I THINK INDICATIVE OF THE FACT THAT WHEN WE SAY THE DEMOCRATIC VOTER TURN OUT IS GIN TO BE LOWER I IAM NOT SO SORE BECAUSE IF THEY ARE PANICANG THAT MEANS THE ACTUALLY WONT TO WIN THE ELECTION SO HERE'S ERN BURNETT WITH THA KATY PORTER THE REPRESENTATIVE WITH WHITEBOARD AND A SHE SHE SAYS SHOULD BIDE ND BE RE PLACE ON THE BALLET WITH THIS CAN OBRUTAL POLLING DOES THE DEMOCRATIEPARTY MEED TO START SERIOUSLY LOOKING AT SOME ONE ELSE PRESIDENT BY HAS DONE A TERRIFIC JOB ON TE ECONOMY AND I THIK THIS IS A MATTER OF JUS PEOPLE WANTING TO TEELL SORT OF DREAM UP WHAT THEY COULD IMAGINE  FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF CANDIDATES THAT THIS PLATE BUT THE TRUTH IS JOBIDN HAS A TERRIFIC STORY TO TELL O THE ECONOMY BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK ULTIMATELY CONGRESS ON TEN THAT IF PEOPLE TOST SAW THE ECONOMY IN DIFFERENTLY THEY WOULDN'T CARE ABOUT ALL THESE OTHER ISSUES THAT THEY THEY SEEM TO HAVE STRONG A PUT PANS ON THE STAMINA THE AGE I WHETHER THEY'RE PROUD TO HAVE IN THIS PRESIDENT ALL OF THOSE A YOU KNOW FRANKLY PRETTY DAMNING NONVERSE WELL I SOMEBODY WHOS RUN THREE TOUGH RACES I HAVE READ A LOT OF POLES AN MY DAY AND THERE'S ALWAYS CROSS

WITH SOME OF THE EXACT SAME DEMOGRAPHICS GOING THE SUPPORT PRESIDENT BIDI AS THET LAST TIME AN I THINK YOU HEAR IF ANYTHING EVEN STRONGER CON SONS ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP SO I MEAN AGAIN Y YOU SE HERE JUST GOING TRUMP THAT IS HER ONLY DEFENCE AND AS YOU'LL SEE THAT' THE DEFENCE MECHANISM FORBIDON ALWAYS IN FRVERIS GOING TO BE TRUMP SO JAK TAPPER WAS ASKING SIMILAR QUESTIONS TO JOBIDONS CAMPAN COCHAIR CEDRI RICHMON SAYING ESSENTIALLY LIKE THESE ARE REALLY BAD POLL NUMBERS WHAT YU CAN DO ABOUT IT DO YOU NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PERCEPTION OF HIS FRAILTY PERCEIVE FRAILTY IS HURING HIS CAMPAGN

WORLD OVER THE NEXT FORN A HALF DAYS TO CONTINUE TO SHOW AMERICAN LEADERSHIP ON THE WORLD STAGE SO WHEN THEY CAN PAR PRESIDENT BIDENS TRAVEL TO THAT OF A REPUBLICANS EVEN REPUBLICANS THAT AF RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HE'S TRAVELLING ALMOST THIRTY PER CENT MORE THAN THERE WOW HE'S IT  SO THER DEFENCE IS THE JOBIDON GOES IN CARS SOMETIMES AND ON PLANS AGAIN PRETTY WE DEALISABETH WARRN WAS ALSO OUT TRYING TO DEFEND JOBIDON YET YOU CAN SEE HOW WEAK THE DEFENCES ARE AND AS WE'LL SEE THE REAL DEFENCE IS THAT WE HATE DONAL TRUMP AS ALWAYS HAS THE ONLY DEFENSE THE DEMOCRATS HAV FOR JOBINE'S PRESIDENCY WHY DO YOU THANKE THERE HAVING SUCH A HARD TIME GETTING OR MESTEE TROU OYA COONY WHY YE THINKS SO MANY DEMOCRATS WOR PARTY LIKE THE TEEST TOLHAT I'LS BE THEIR STANDARD BARRES SHERE YE KNOWT WHAT I I CAN'T DO POLES I'M NOT GOOD AT THIS BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS PRESDENTS LEAN A GREAT CHO HE CAN AND HOW DO I KNOW THAT I JUST LOOK AN WHAT HE HAS DELIVERED I LOOK AT THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS L AND WAL AND WELL SEN TO HIT T TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR CAP ON WHAT SENIORS AY POUPOCKET MEDICAL CARE I LOOK AT TUNKES AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE RECHOS OUT WEN TO GET BLAD FOR THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS HERE AN FIFTY

A RECRUITER A AT THE HARVARD LAW PARTY I WEN TO WHEN THEY WRE WHEN THEYWR DOING GROUPMIN UNLESS ANCHELS AND OM ELIZABETH WARN IS MARN A FREEPOLE THIS THIS THIS IS ABSOLUTE NONSENSE BUT AGAIN THE FINAL DEMOCRATIC PITCH IS GOIN TO HAVE NOTHING TO DOITO JOBIDINS CAN TO HAVE TO BE ENTIRELY TO DO WITH DONALD TRUMP WHICH IS WHY IF THAT'S THEIR PLAN IF THEIR PLAN IS WE RUN AGAINST TONALD TRUMP THEN THE EPOOR PULLING FORBIDON ACTUALLY CREATES KIND OF A BAZAR SWEET SPOT IN THE EYE OF THIS HURRICANE FOR HIM LL GET TO THAT MOMENTARILY ITS VERY WEIRD FIRST HAVE YOUR INVESTED IN LIKE A NICE JACK CHOOS

EIGHTY MILLION AMERICANS TO TAKE A ACCEING THE DEY DO' WONT A DAY OR WHEN JOBIDON DECIDES TO RELIEVE STUDENT LOANS SIMPLY WHAT THE WAVE OF HIS PEN OR WHEN MEMBERS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TRY TO UNDER MINE THE CREDIBILITY OF THE SUPREME COURT WOR WHEN THEY REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE ELECTIONS IN GEORGEO FOR EXAMPLE LIKE STACSY ABRAMS WHEN ALL THAT HAPPENS THAT APPARENTLIES  GOOD SOLID GOVERNMENTS WHEN REPUBLICANS DO ANY OF THE ABOVE THEN THAT OF COURSE IS I IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY BUT THE REALITY IS THAT ARE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS ARE PRETTY DURABLE AND HEY'VE PROVE THEMSELVES PRETTY DURABLE

TERRIBLE PRESENT HE'S REALLY BAT THO JOBICAUS YOU KNOW WHAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS AGREE WITH THAT AND BY THE WAY TOBIDIN'S GETTING WORSE ACCORDING T THE LOSANTIALIST TINDS THE BIDIN ADMINISTRATION IS NOW CONSIDERING FORCING SOME MIGRAN FAMILIES TO ENTER THE COUNTRY WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION TO REMAIN NEAR THE BORDER IN TEXAS WHILE AWAITING ASYLUM SCREENIG EFFECTIVELY LIVITING THEIR

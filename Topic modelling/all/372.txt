WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LACONCA THE U SCIENCE THE SCIENCE TASE TOCE FRLI  I MANJER HUBERMAN AND O RO PROFESSOR OF NAUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AND STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE MY GUEST TO DAY IS DOCTOR LEESA FELDMAN BARRETT DOCTOR LESA FELDMAN BARRETT IS THA DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT NORTH EASTERN UNIVERSITY SHE ALSO HOLDS APPOINTMENTS AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL AND MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL WHERE SHE IS THE CHIEF SCIENTIFIC OFFICER OF THE CENTERE OF LAW BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR DOCTOR BARRET HAS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE TOP WORLD EXPERTS IN THE STUDY OF EMOTIONS AND HER LABORATORY HAS STUDIED EMOTIONS USING APPROACHES BOTH FROM THE FIELDS OF PSYCHOLOGY AND NAUROW SCIENCE INDEED TO DAY YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT THE NEURL CIRCUITS AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL UNDER PINNINGS OF WHAT WE CALL EMOTIONS YOU WILL LEARN WHAT EMOTIONS TRULY ARE AND HOW TO INTERPRET DIFFERENT EMOTIONAL STATES YOU WIL ALSO LEARN HOW EMOTIONS RELATE TO THINGS LIKE MOTIVATION CONSCIOUSNESS AND AFFECT AFFECT IS THE TERM THAT REFERS TO A MORE GENERAL STATE OF BRAIN AND BODY THAT INCREASES OR DECREASES THE PROBABILITY THAT YOU WILL EXPERIENCE CERTAIN EMOTIONS DURING TO DAY'S DISCUSSION DOCTOR FELDMAN BARRET ALSO TEACHES US HOW TO REGULATE OUR EMOTIONS EFFECTIVELY AS WELL AS HOW TO BETTER INTERPRET THE EMOTIONAL STATES OF OTHERS YOU WILL ALSO LEARN ABOUT THE POWERFUL RELATIONSHIP THAT EXISTS BETWEEN OUR EMOTIONAL STATES AND THE MOVEMENT OF OUR BODY IN FACT MUCH OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS BOTH PRACTICAL AND WILL BE HIGHLY INFORMATIVE IN TERMS OF THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING EMOTIONS AND IT IS LIKELY TO ALSO BE SURPRISING TO YOU IN THE NUMBER OF WAYS IT CERTAINLY WAS SURPRISING TO ME I'VE BEEN A CLOSE FOLLOWER OF DOCTOR FELDMAN BARRETT'S WORK OVER MANY YEARS NOW AND HAVE ALWAYS FOUNDED WE TREMENDOUSLY INFORMATIVE AND WHEN I SAY HER WORK I MEAN BOTH HER ACADEMIC PUBLISHED PAPERS AS WELL AS HER PUBLIC LECTURES THAT SHE'S GIVEN AND HER TWO FABULOUS BOOKS ON EMOTIONS IN THE BRAIN THE FIRST ONE ENTITLED HOW EMOTIONS ARE MADE AND THE SECOND BOOK WHICH INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT EMOTIONS BUT EXTENDS BEYOND THAT ENTITLE SEVEN AND HALF LESSONS ABOUT THE BRAIN AS YOU'LL SEE FROM TO DAY'S DISCUSSION DOCTOR FELDMAN BARRET IS NOT ONLY EXTREMELY INFORMED ABOUT THE NARO SCIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGY OF EMOTION SHE'S ALSO FABULOUS SLEE GOOD AT TEACHING US THAT INFORMATION INCLEAR TERMS AND INACTIONABLE WAYS YOU'LL ALSO NOTICE SEVERAL TIMES SHE PUSHES BACK ON MY QUESTIONS IN SOME CASES EVEN TELLING ME THAT MY QUESTIONS ARE ILL POSED AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT I WAS ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED THAT SHE DID THAT BECAUSE YOU'LL SEE THAT EVERY TIME SHE DID THAT IT WAS WITH THE CLEAR PURPOSE OF PUTTING MORE SPECIFICITY ON THE QUESTION AND THEREBY MORE SPECIFICITY AND CLARITY ON THE ANSWER WHICH OF COURSE SHE DELIVERS BY THE END OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION YOU WILL HAVE BOTH A BROAD AND IN DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT EMOTIONS ARE AND THEIR ORIGINS IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY YOU WILL ALSO HAVE MANY PRACTICAL TOOLS WITH WHICH TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND NAVIGATE EMOTIONAL STATES AND MOREOVER YOU WILL HAVE MANY PRACTICAL TOOLS IN ORDER TO INCREASE YOUR LEVELS OF MOTIVATION AND BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR VARIOUS STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE AT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTOC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS EIGHT SLEEP EIGHT SLEEP MAKE SMART MATTRESS COVERS WITH COOLING HEATING AND SLEEP TRACKING CAPACITY SPOKEN MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE FACT THAT SLEEP IS THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AN PERFORMANCE ONE OF THE KEYTHINGS TO GETTING A GREAT NIGHT SLEEP IS TO CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT AND THAT'S BECAUSE IN ORDER TO FALL AND STAY DEEPLY ASLEEP YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE HAS TO DROP BY ONE TO THREE DEGREES AND IN ORDER TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING FEELING REFRESHED YOUR BODY TEMPERTURE ACTUALLY HAS TO INCREASE BY ONE TO THREE DEGREES WITH EIGHT SLEEP IT'S VERY EASY TO CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT IT'S A MATTRESS COVER THAT ALLOWS YOU TO CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT AT THE BEGINNING MIDDLE END END OF YOUR NIGHT AND IN DOING SO ALLOW YOU TO FALL AND STAY D PLY ASLEEP THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT AND WAKE UP FEELING EXTREMELY REFRESHED I STARTED SLEEPING ON AN EIGHT SLEEP MATCHERS COVER WELL OVER TWO YEARS AGO AND IT HAS GREATLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF MY SLEEP IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY EIGHT SLEEP YOU CAN GO TO EIGHT SLEEP DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMAN TO SAVE UP TO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS OFF THEIR POD THREE COVER EIGHT SLEEP CURRENTLY SHIPS IN THE OU ESSAY CANDIDA OU K SELECT COUNTRIES IN THE EU AND AUSTRALIA AGAIN THAT'S EIGHT SLEEP DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMAN TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY LEVELS LEVELS IS A PROGRAME THAT LETS YOU SEE HOW DIFFERENT FOODS AND BEHAVIORS AFFECT YOUR HEALTH BY GIVING YOU REAL TIME FEED BACK USING A CONTINUOUS GLUCO SMONITOR ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS IMPACTING YOUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH IS THE WAY THAT YOUR BODY MANAGES ITS BLOOD GLUCOS OR SOMETIMES REFER TO AS BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS TO MAINTAIN ENERGY AND FOCUS THOUGHOUT THE DAY YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR BLOOD LUCO STEADY WITHOUT BIG SPIKES OR DIPS USING LEVELS YOU CAN MONITOR HOW DIFFERENT TYPES OF FOODS AND DIFFERENT FOOD COMMINATIONS AS WELL AS FOOD TIMING AND THINGS LIKE EXERCISE COMBINE TO IMPACT YOUR BLOOD LUCO SLEVELS I STARTED USING LEVELS A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO AND IT GIVE ME A LOT OF INSIDE INTO HOW SPECIFIC FOODS WERE SPIKING MY BLOOD SUGAR AND THEN LEAVING ME FEELING TIRED FOR SEVERAL HOURS AFTERWARDS AS WELL AS HOW THE SPACING OF EXERCISE AND MY MEALS WAS IMPACTING MY OVER ALL ENERGY AND IN DOING SO IT REALLY ALLOWED ME TO OPTIMISE HOW I EAT WHAT I EAT WHEN I EXERCISE AND SO ON SUCH THAT MY BLOODGLUCOS LEVELS AND ENERGY LEVELS ARE STABLE THROUGHOUT THE DAY IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT LEVELS AND TRYING A CONTINUOUS GLUCOS MONITOR YOURSELF GO TO LEVELS DOT LINK SLASH HUBERMAN RIGHT NOW LEVELS IS OFFERING AN ADDITIONAL TWO FREE MONTHS OF MEMBERSHIP AGAIN THAT'S LEVELS DOT LINK ELLI ND K SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET TWO FREE MONTHS OF MEMBERSHIP AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR LEESA FELDMAN BEAR IT DOCTOR LES A FELDMAN BER IT WELCOME HOW I MY LEASURE TO BE HERE I'VE WANTED TO TALK TO YOU FOR A VERY LONG TIME I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT EMOTIONS I THINK EVERYONE HAS A SENSE SOMEHOW OF WHAT AN EMOTION IS FEELING HAPPY FEELING SAD FEELING EXCITED FEELING A CURIOUS PERHAPS IT'S EVEN EMOTION I DON'T KNOW YOU'LL TELL US WHAT ARE THE COR COMPONENCE WHAT'RE AE SORT OF MACKROM NUTRIENCE OF  OF AN EMOTION A BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER NOT WE SHOULD BE TALK ABOUT EMOTIONS FIRSTSTATES BUT WHAT IS AN EMOTION WE ALL ARE FAMILIAR WITH WHAT ONE FEELS LIKE TO US BUT FROM A SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE HOW DO YOU DEFINE AN EMOTION WELL SCIENT THIS IS ALL SCIENTISTS DEBATE ABOUT THIS I'M NOBODY IN THE LAST HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO AGRY ON WHAT AN EMOTION IS AM AND I THINK FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE INTERESTING BUT TRICKY BIT IS THAT ANY TIME YOU WANT A TALK ABOUT WHAT THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS ARE OF EMOTION NONE OF THOSE BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS ARE SPECIFIC TO EMOTION SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE GROUP OF SCIENTISTS WHO WILL TELL YOU WELL AN EMOTION IS A CO ORDINATED RESPONSE WERE YOU HAVE A CHANGE IN AM SOME PHYSICAL STATE A CHANGE IN THE BRAIN A CHANGE IN THE PHYSICAL STATE AM WHICH AM LEADS YOU TO MAKE A PARTICULAR FACIAL EXPRESSION SO YOU'VE GOT PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE BODY CHANGES IN THE BRAIN CHANGES IN THE FACE OR IN MOTOR MOVEMENTS PAY BUT THAT DESCRIBES SPASICALLY EVERY MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE I YOURE FACE IS ALWAYS MOVING IN SOME WAY IF IT WASN'T YOU WOULD LOOK LIKE AN AVATAR BASICALLY SO WORK WERE CONSTANTLY ENGAGED IN IN MOVEMENTS AND THOSE MOVEMENTS HAVE TO BE CO ORDINATED WITH THE PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE BODY BECAUSE WHETHER ERE WHETHER WE'RE IN A STATE THAT WE WOULD CONVENTIONALLY CALL EMOTION OR NOT BECAUSE THE PHYSIOLOGYIS SUPPORTING THOSE ITSUPPORTING THE YOU KNOW THE GLUE COUSTS AND THE XYGEN AND ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO MAKE A MOVEMENTS OF YOUR BODY AND OF COURSE ALL THESE MOVEMENTS ARE BEING CO ORDINATED BY YOUR BRAIN SO OF COURSE THERE'S A CO ORDINATED SAT OF A FEATURES THAT DOESN'T REALLY DESCRIBE HOW EMOTIONS ARE DISTINCT FROM ANY OTHER EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE BUT THE THE CLAIM WAS FOR REALLY LONG TIME THAT THERE WOULD BE DIAGNOSTIC PATTERNS CASE SO WHEN SOMETHING TRIGGERED FEAR YOU WOULD HAVE AN INCREASE IN HEART RATE AND YOU WOULD HAVE AM A PROPENSITY TO RUN AWAY OR TO FREEZE OR EM NOT TUS TEFALL ASLEEP ALTHOUGH THAT IS SOMETHING ANIMALS DO WHEN THEY ARE FACED FOR THE CREDITOR BUT THAT'S NOT PART OF THE WESTERN STAREATYPE FOR FEAR SO THAT WASN'T WHAT SCIENTISTS WERE LOOKING FOR AND A AND ALSO THAT YOU WOULD MAKE A A PARTICULAR FACIAL EXPRESSION WHICH WAS PRESUMED TO BE THE UNIVERSAL EXPRESSION OF FEAR WERE YOU WIDEN YOUR EYES WHEN YOU GASP LIKE AM THAT FACIAL SET OF FACIAL MOVEMENTS IN OTHER CULTURES LIKE IN MELANESIAN CULTURE FOR EXAMPLE IS EM IS A SYMBOL OF THREAT WHERE YOU ARE THREATENING SOMEWHAT YOU ARE THREATENING THEM WITH A GRESSION BASICALLY IS A WAR FACE BUT IN WESTERN CULTURES THAT'S THE THE FACE THAT WESTERN SCIENTISTS BELIEVED WAS THE YOU KNOW THE THE DISTINCTIVE A PART OF THAT DISTINCTIVE PATTERN FOR FEAR AND SO THE WAY THAT SCIENTISTS DEFIND EMOTION FOR A LONG TIME WAS THESE KIND OF EM STATES WHERE YOU'D SEE THIS DIAGNOSTIC ON SOMBLE OF SIGNALS AND THAT WOULD MEAN THAT ANY TIME SOME ONE SHOWED ONE OF THOSE SIGNALS THEY MAY MOVE THEIR FACE IN A PARTULAR WAY OR THEIR HEART INCREASED AT A PARTICULAR TIME YOUD BE ABLE TO DIAGNOSE THEM AS BEING IN A STATE OF FEAR AS OPPOSED TO A STATE OF ANGER OR SADNESS WHATEVER THE EMPIRICAL EVIDEN ENTS AM JUST DOESN'T BEAR THAT OUT AND SO IT WAS KIND OF A MYSTERY THE MYSTERY IS HOW IS IT THAT YOU FEEL ANGRY OR SAD OR HAPPY OR YOU KNOW FULL OF GRATITUDE OR AWHE HOW IS IT THAT YOU EXPERIENTE THESE MOMENTS BUT SCIENTISTS CAN'T FIND A SINGLE SAT OF PHYSICAL MARTYRS THAT CORRESPOND WITH EACH STATE DISTINCTIVELY RIGHT THAT IN ANY WAY THAT YOU COULD TELL THEM APART THAT'S A THAT WAS A REALLY BIG PUZZLE FOR REALLY LONG TIME I HAVE TO ASK YOU ABOUT THIS PERHAPS SMYTH PERHAPS TRUTH ABOUT FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AND EMOTIONS BECAUSE AS YOU WERE EXPLAINING THE COOR COMPONENTS OF EMOTIONS I HAD TO THINK BACK TO THE CLASSIC TEXT BOOK IMAGES OF THE DIFFERENT FACES ASSOCIATED WITH FEAR WITH DELIGHT WITH CONFUSION NON AN ON WE WILL GET TO THAT AND YOUR OPINIONS ON THAT SCIENTIFICALLY N IN FORMED OPINIONS OF COURSE BUT THERE IS A BIT OF A MYTH THAT THE EMOTION SYSTEM AND THE FACIAL EXPRESSION SYSTEM RUN IN BOTH DIRECTIONS FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE WILL SAY IF YOU SMILE IT'S HARDER TO FEEL SAD OR ANXIOUS I CAN'T SAY THT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE BUT I VERY WELL COULD BE WRONG SO WE KNOW THAT WHEN PEOPLE'S EMOTIONAL STATES CHANGE THEIR FACIAL EXPRESSIONS OFTEN WILL CHANGE RIDIF YOU SEE SOME ONE CRYING ON THE STREET AWERSISSOMEMDY SMILING REALLY BIGLY YOU WE CAN MAKE SOME ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE GOING ON AINTERNALLY FOR THEM BUT PUT SIMPLY IS IT TRUE THAT CHANGING ONE'S FACIAL EXPRESSION CAN D DIRECT SHIFTS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY PERHAPS THAT CHANGE OUR EMOTIONAL STATE IF YOU'LL PERMIT ME WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT YOUR QUESTION IS ILL POSED SO FIRST OF ALL IT PRESUMES THAT THERE IS AN EMOTION SYSTEM AND THAT THERE'S A FACIAL EXPRESSION SYSTEM NOW CLEARLY IS A SYSTEM FOR MOVING FACIAL MUSCLES OQUET BUT A MOVEMENT IS NOT THE SAME AS AN EXPRESSION A MOVEMENT IS A MOVEMENT AN EXPRESSION IS AN INTERPRETATION OF THE MEANING OF A MOVEMENT NOT ALL MOVEMENTS OF THE FACE ARE EXPRESSIONS AM AND THIS IS A YOU KNOW A PROBLEM IS A PROBLEM IN SCIENCE 'M IN IT'S OFTEN THE CASE I THINK IN MY EXPERIENCE IN THE SCIENCE OF EMOTION BUT ELSEWHERE TO THAT SCIENTISTS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO MAKE THEIR WORK IM MEANINGFUL TO PEOPLE WE'LL TRY TO INTERPRET THEIRE FINDINGS IN IN WAYS THAT THE AVERAGE PERSON WOULD AFIND INTERESTING OR THE WAY THAT A PHYSICIAN WOULD FIND INTERESTING OR A TEACHER OR WOATD HAVE YOU TO BE ABLE TO USE THIS INFORMATION BUT THEN THEY FORGET THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY MAKING AN INTERPRETATION AND THEY START TO REFER TO THEIR OBSERVATIONS WITH THE LABELS OF INTERPRETATION SO FACIAL MOVEMENTS ARE FACIAL MOVEMENTS PEOPLE MOVE THEIR FACES AND THAT THOSE MOVEMENTS HAVE MEANING BUT THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS TO EXPRESS AN INTERNAL STATE IN FACT ONE MIGHT THINK THAT THEY'RE VERY REARLY TO IM EXPRESS AN INTERNAL STATE SO I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S OFFACIAL EXPRESSION SYSTEM EITHER SO THAT'S THERE' CERTAINLY LIKE I SAID A THEIR THERE CIRCUITRY FOR MOVING A FACE BUT IM BUT WHAT THOSE MOVEMENTS MEAN IM T IS HIGHLY VARIABLE AND SO THAT WOULD BE MY SECOND POINT THAN WHERE I WOULD SAY WHEN YOU SEE SOME ONE CRYING ON THE STREET YOU ARE NOT LOOKING ONLY AT THEIR FACE YOU MIGHT BE AWARE UM THAT YOUR FOCUSSING ON THEIR FACE THAT MIGHT BE THE PART OF THE ENTIRE CENSORY ON SOMBLE THAT YOU ARE FOCUSSING YOUR ATTENTION ON BUT YOUR BRAIN IS TAKING IN AN ENTIRE ON SOMBLEO SIGNALS AS YOU KNOW IT'S TAKING IN NOT JUST THE MEN A MOVEMENTS OF THE FACE THE TEARS OR WHATEVER IT'S TAKING IN ALL OF THE THE ENTIRE CENSORY RAY THE SOUNDS THET SMELLS WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE YOUR OWN BODY YOUR BRAIN IS BEING U BUMBARDED WITH SIGNALS FROM FROM ALL OF THOSE SOURCES AND WHEN IT'S MAKING A MEANING OUT OF ANY SIGNAL IT'S DOING IT IN AND ON SOMBLE OF SIGNALS SO RESEARCH SHOWS THAT BABIES CRIES AREN'T A CUSTICALLY SPECIFIC TO WHEN THEY'RE TIRED OR HUNGRY OR RIGHT UM THE YOU CAN I CAN SHOW YOU A VIDIO WITHOUT CONTXT AND SHOW YOU SOME ONE CRYING AN UM YOU MIGHT MAKE A JUDGMENT YOU MIGHT THINK MAKE THE STERATIPIC JUDGMENT IN THE WEST OR THAT PERSON IS SAD DTHEN WE PAN OUT IN REALLY YOU KNOW IT'S A LITTLE GIRL WHO'S DAD JUST CAME HOME FROM YOUR ROCK OR SOMETHING RIGHT SO BRAINS ARE ALWAYS INTERPRETING FACES IN CONTEXT THEY'RE MAKING GUESSES THISS SOMETHING THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT QUITE A BIT THAT WE DON'T READ MOVEMENTS IN PEOPLE WE DON'T RED EMOTIONS IN FACIAL EXPRESSIONS WE MAKE INFERENCES ABOUT THE EMOTIONAL MEANING A FACIAL MOVEMENTS AND WE DO IT IN AND ON SOMBLE OF OTHER SIGNALS THE THE CONTACT AS YOU IF YOU WILL AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING SO UM DO I THINK THAT UM THAT THERE'S FEED BACK FROM THE FACE TO THE BRAIN SURE I MEAN THERE'S FEED BACK FROM EVERY MUSCLE BUT THERE'S THIS CONSTANT CONVERSA TION BETWEEN THE BRAIN AND THE BODY AM THE BRAIN IS SENDING MOTOR COMMANDS THE BODY IS HAS SENSORY SURFACES WHICH ARE SENDING SIGNALS BACK TO THE BRAIN SO IF THE FACE IS INFLUENCING THE BRAIN IT'S DOING SO IN A WAY THAT'S NOT SPECIAL IT IT'S DOING IT IN A WAY THAT THAT WORKS FOR ALL OTHER PARTS OF YOUR BODY TOO AND I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY THIS COND OF ALONG WINDED ANSWER BUT OVER TIME YOUR BRAIN HAS LEARNED THAT CERTAIN PATTERNS OF SIGNAL OVER TIME AM RECUR AND SO IF YOU'RE SMILING IF YOUR BRAIN IS YOU KNOW TELLING YOUR YOUR FACIAL MUSCLES TO MOVE IN A PARTICULAR WAY THAT LOOKS LIKE SMILING AM IT'S HAPPENING IN A LARGER UN SUMBLE SIGNALS AND THAN THE BRAIN IS PREDICTING WHAT'S GOINGTO HAPPEN NEXT BECAUSE IT'S LEARNED OVER TIME WHAT HAPPENS NEXT SO PROBABLISTICALLY SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT AS CAUSE THEN SURE BUT IT'S NOT IS IT'S NOT THI SIMPLISTIC KIND OF IDEA THAT AN EMOTION IS TRIGGERED AM I IT CAUSS FACIAL MUSCLES TO MOVE IN A PARTICULAR WAY AND THEREFORE IF YOU JUST POSE YOUR FACE IN IN THOSE IN THAT PARTICULAR ARRANGEMENT IF THAT WILL SOMEHOW FEED BACK TO THE EMOTION SYSTEM AND CHANGE THAT SYSTEM CAUSE THERE ARE NO THERE IS NO EMOTION SYSTEM IN YOUR BRAIN AND THE THE CAUSATION JUST ISN'T THAT IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLISTICALLY MECHANISTIC THE MEXTENSE TO ME I A FRANKLY NEVER BOUGHT THE IDEA THAT JUST SMILING WOULD MAKE ME FEEL HAPPY AM ESPECIALLY IF MY INTERNAL STATE WAS NOT ONE OF HAPPINESS LIKE FIGHTING THE INTERNAL STATE ALSO A IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS I THINK IT WAS THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW POSITIONING THE BODY AND CERTAIN WAYS YOU KNOW TAKING UP MORE SPACE WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE TO FEEL MORE POWERFUL TAND A SOME OF THESE STUDIES AM AN ARGUED THAT THE WERE EVEN HORMONAL SHIFTS ASSOCIATED WITH A'M TAKING UP MORE SPACE THAT WERE ASSOCIATE WITH FEELINGS OF EMPOWERMENT AND THAN WHEN SHRINKING OF ONESELF WAS IN ASSOCIATE WITH T ELEVATED CARTES ALL STATESONS I SAY ALL THIS AND I I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT A I DO NOT TAKE A SIMPLISTIC VIEW OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OROE CRIM SYSTEM AND II DIDN'T A I DON'T THINK THAT YOU WERE IMPLYING THAT EITHER SO ONE MAY SURE THAT ANYONE LISTENING IN WATCHING ISN'T THINKING THAT A FOR INSTANCE THAT CORT IS ALL AS BAD CORTIS ALL IS WONDERFUL AND ESSENTIAL YOU JUST NEED IT REGULATED PROPERLY OR THAT A THE IDEA THAT THE BODY AND EMOTIONAL STATES ARE ARE INEXTRICABLE IN LENKTH MAKES A TON OF SENSE TO ME BUT THE IDEA THAT YOU COULD JUST YOU KNOW GRAB ON TO ONE OF THE NODES IN THE EI NO HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT SAY MOTION SYSTEM AM LIKE POSITION OF THE BODY LIKE BEING HUNCHED OVER MAKES YOU DEPRESSED NOW THEN EVER MADE SENSE TO ME TAKING UP MORE SPACE MAKES YOU FEEL MORE A POWERFUL THAT DOESN'T I IT CAN'T BE THAT WAY AND YET WE WERE TOLD FOR ABOUT A DECADE THROUGH ESPECILLY THROUGH POPULAR PRESS THAT THIS STUFF WAS TRUE AM AND SO WHAT I LOVE ABOUT YOUR WORK IS THAT IT INCLUDES ANERNATOMICAL PSYCHOLOGICAL A NETWORK PERSPECTIVE THAT THAT THERE ISN'T ONE SEAT OF EMOTIONS AND AND SO ON AM SO F WE COAN GO A LOABIT FURTHER INTO THE FACIAL EXPRESSION PIECE FOR A MOMENT RI WAS TAUGHT IN MY PSYCHOLOGY IN NERAL SCIENCE TEXT BOOKS CAUSE IT WAS RIGHT THEIRE IN FRONT OF ME THAT THERE WERE SOME QER CATEGORIES OF FACIAL EXPRESSION THAT WERE UNIVERSAL CROSS CULTURES THAT CONVEYED SOMETHING ABOUT THE INTERNAL STATE OF THE PERSON THAT THE DOWNWARD OU NO LIPS IN THE CORNER AND AND SOME AND MAY BE EVEN A FURROWING OF THE BROW WAS ASSOCI ATED WITH NEGATIVE ALENT STATES LIKE SADNESS PERHAPS EVEN DEPRESSION THA THE OPPOSITE OF UPWARD TURNED CORNERS OF THE MOUTH AND WIDENING OF THE EYES WAS DELIGHT AND EXCITEMENT SOMEBONE THAT FEELS PRETTY TRUE TO MY EXPERIENCE BUT HOW DO YOU AN OTHERS SERIOUS SCIENTISTS OF EMOTIONS VIEW THAT SOMEWHAT CLASSIC LITERATURE KNOW YES SO I'LL JUST SAY THAT MI AM MY JOURNEY HERE MY SCIENTIFIC JOURNEY WAS NOT ONE OF AM ATTEMPTING TO OVERTURN AM A CENTURY'S WORTH OF I WE LID TO SWEAR BULSHET BASICLEAMIN IS JUST IT'S LIKE ITS ITS STERIOITS PASICALLY WESTERN STARIA TYPES INSHRINED AS SCIENTIFIC A FACT AND THAT SOUNDS ILIKE A PRETTY HARSH THING TO SAY BUT I THINK I PRETTY MUCH STAND BY THAT AT THIS POINT AM BUT FOR ME WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE SON WHEN I WASNAT UNDERGRADUATE IN AT IN PSYCHOLOGY AND IN PHYSIOLOGY AN AN INTHRAPOLOGY YOU KNOW I ALSO HAD READ THAT DARWIN SAID THAT THERE WERE THESE PESTINCTIVE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS THAT A WERE CO ORDINATED WITH SPECIFIC EMOTIONAL STATES THE SPECIFIC STASS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THIS WAS DARWIN'S VIEW AND I ASSUMED IT WAS CORRECT AM UNTIL I STARTED TO TRY TO USE THAT INFORMATION AM IN THE LAB AND EVERYTHING FELL APART YOU KNOW SO WHEN YOU SHOW SOME ONE IN A LABORATORY LIKE A STUDENT ERE I'M SOMEBODY FROM THE COMMUNITY A FACE A DISEMBODIED FACE WHERE THERE OUGHT THE PERSONS EYES ARE WIDENED IN THE FACE AN THEIR GASPING LIKE A STERETIPIC FER EXPRESSION MOST OF THE TIME THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS AND SO I WOULD TRY TO USE THESE FACES AND UM AS STIMULEAN EXPERIMENTS AND THEY WEREN'T THEY WEREN'T WORKING THE WAY THAT THEYARE SUPPOSED TO WORK AND THERE WERE REALLY GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF PSYCHOLOGY THERE WERE ALWAYS DEBATES ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS WAS ACTUALLY ACCURATE AND THERE'S A REALLY INTERESTING STORY ABOUT HOW DARWIN CAME TO THIS IDEA UM WHICH I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT BUT IT IT'S NOT BECAUSE HE CARED ABOUT A MOTION AND HE WAS BASICALLY TAKING HIS OWN VERY WESTERN VIEWS ABOUT EMOTION TO MAKE SOME CLAIMS ABOUT EVOLUTION ACTUALLY SO UM I'VE MORE TO SAY ABOUT THAT AND ABOUT WHY IT'S A PROBLEM TO TAKE ANYTHING THAT ANYBODY SAID EVEN DARWIN FRUM YOU KNOW HUN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR SO YEARS AGO O WHATEVER IT IS AND TREAT IT LIKE ITS A MODERN TEXT YOU KNOW HE WAS WRITING AT A PARTICULAR TIME FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE UM AND THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT WHATEVER HE WROTE IS TRUE UM BUT I'LL JUST TELLYOU WHAT THE EVIDENCE SAYS UM THAT THERE HAS BEEN IN PSYCHOLOGY A DEBATE REALLY VICIOUS DEBATE ACTUALLY FOR PROBABLY FIFTY YEARS ABOUT THE NATURE OFFACIAL EXPRESSIONS AND WHETHER THEYRE UNIVERSAL AND WHETHER THERE'S THIS ONE TO ONE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN A PARTICULAR FACE AND LIKE OFFACIAL CONFIGURATION IN A PARTICULAR EMOTIONAL STATE SMILING AND HAPPINESS SCOWLING AN ANGER WRINKLING YOUR NOSE AND DISGUST AND SO IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I THINK THE ASSOCIATION FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE UM TASKED ME AND SOME OTHER SENIOR SCIENTISTS A WITH A ATTEMPTING TO WRITE A WHITE PAPER A CONCENSUS PAPER ON WHAT THE LITERATURE ACTUALLY SHOW SO WHAT IS A RESERCH ACTUALLY SHOW HE R EAD ALL THE RESEARCH YOU KNOW CAN YOU FIND A PATTERN THERE DOES IT ACTUALLY REVEAL ANYTHING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT FACIAL EXPRESSIONS ARE UNIVERSAL PARTICULARLY FOR EMOTION EM AN THE WAY THEY DO THIS THEY HAVE A JOURNAL FOR THIS PURPOSE FOR TAKING A WIDELY HELD BELIEF THAT IS HIGHLY DEBATED AND BRINGING TOGETHER A PANEL OF EXPERTS WHO DISAGREE WITH EACH OTHER AT THE OUTSET AND THEY HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO SEE IF TEY CAN COME TO CONSENTS THIS OVER THE DATA AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE TRIED IN THE PAST AND  WE NEVER REALLY VICIOUS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN VICIOUS WITH EACH ETHER OVER THIS QUESTION SO WHAN WE BROUGHT TOGETHER A GROUP OF PEOPLE SO MET SEVERAL PEOPLE REFUSED TO SERVE SENIOR SCIENTIST REFUSED TO SERVE ON THIS PANEL BY A A FEUR AN THEY'RE FUNDIN NERSAL YOU KNOW THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT WHY SIN A CERTAIN SCIENTISTS WOULD NOT ONE TO ENGAGE WIT A WITH EM PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH THEM EM THAT'S A INTERESTING CONVERSATION TO HAVE BUT EM I DON'T THINK IT'S AS SIMPLE ACTUALLY AS JUST THEY THEIR CAREERIST OR THEY THEY CARE ABOUT YOU KNOW THEIR MONEY OR OR FUNDING OR WHATEVER  THAT WOULD BE AN EASY ANSWER BUT I DON'T ACTUALLY THINK THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON BUT THAT'S ANOTHER SOR OF THE ANYWAY SO A THERE WERE FIVE OF US WHO GOT TOGETHER EM ALL SENIOR SCIENTISTS ALL FROM DIFFERENT FIELDS SOME OF US HADN'T MET EACH OTHER BEFORE WE ALL KNEW OF EACH OTHER OF COURSE AND WE MET OVER ZOUME FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS IS AS PRECOVED CAUSE PEOPLE WERE ALL OVER THE WORLD RIGHT AND WE WE READ OVER A THOUSAND PAPERS SO SO I WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THIS GROUP OF THE FIVE OF US WHO MY STARTING HYPOTHESIS WAS THAT FACIAL MOVEMENTS ARE MEANINGFUL BUT THEY'RE NOT THERE'S NO ONE TO ONE CORRESPOND ENS BETWEEN A PARTICULAR FACIAL CONFIGURATION LIKE A SCOWL AND ANGER NOT NOT JUST THAT IT WOULD VARY ACROSS CULTURES BUT THAT IT VARIES FOR YOU ACROSS SITUATIONS I MEAN DO YOU SCOWL EVERY TIME YOU'RE ANGRY I DON'T SCOWL EVERY TIME I'M ANGRY IN FACT AND I ALSO SCOWL AT TIMES WHEN I'M NOT ANGRY SO AND THERE ARE SCIENTIFIC REASONS TO THINK THAT THAT THE THAT A THE COLLECTION OF FACIAL EXPRESSIONS THAT PEOPLE MAKE WHEN THEY'RE ANGRY OR WHEN THEY'RE SAT OR WHATEVER WOULD BE HIGHLY VARIABLE SO THAT WAS MY STARTING POSITION AND THEN THE THERE WERE VERY BEFORE GUYES SO THERE WERE I JUST REFER THEM AS E GUS CAUSE IT WAS ME AND FORE GUYS AND THE GUYSE THEY ALL TO SOME EXTENT THOUGHT THAT FACIAL EXPRESSIONS WERE UNIVERSAL BUT THE HAD DIFFERING REASONS AND ALL FOR FOR FOR HIPOTHESIZING THAT THEY ALSO HAD DIFFERENT COMMITMENTS DEGREES OF COMMETMENT TO THAT PERPOSITION BUT WE WRITE OFF THE BAT SORT OF AGREED THAT WE DIDN'T MATTER WHO WAS RIGHT THAT WAS JUST NOT WELL OFIT THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERED WAS THAT WE COULD COME TO THE CONSENSEUS OVER THE DATA AND IF WE COULDN'T WE HAD TO REALLY PIN POINT WHY LIKE SO WHAT WOULD BE THE CRITICAL EXPERIMENTS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE IN ORDER FOR US TO COME TO CONSENSIS OVER THE DATA AND WE ALSO AGREED THAT I'M WE HAD ALL KINDS OF CONTINGENCY SEID UP SO YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT FIVE SENIOR PEOPLE WHO WERE ALL RUNNING BIG LABS AND THEY'RE INVESTING YOU KNOW UPWARDS OF THREE YEARS WORKING ON A PAPER SO IF WE CAN'T COME TO CONSENSEUS WHEN WE GOING TO DAY OR WE GING TO WRITE ONE PAPER AN SORT OF RIGHT ABOUT THE PROCESS OR WHERE WE GOINGTO WRITE SEPARATE PAPERS OR YOU KNOW BUT WE WE HAD ALL THESE CONTINGENCIES LAID OUT BUT THE KEY HERE I THINK IS THAT WE AGREED THAT WE WERE NOT GOING TO BE ADVERSERIAL ABOUT IT CAUSE IT DIDN'T MATTER WHO WAS RIGHT AND IN FACT IF SOMEBODY HAD TO ADMIT THEY WERE WRONG AND SOME ONE WAS GOOD A HAVE TO ADMIT THEY WERE WRONG A D IT TURNS AT ALL OF US WERE WRONG ABOUT SOMETHING BUT IT WE WERE GOING TO BE LIKE SUPPORTIVE OF EACH OTHER AND AND REALLY ENCOURAGE EACH OTHER AN BECAUSE YOU KNOW BEING WRONG IS NO ONE LIKES TO BE WRONG BUT FOR SCIENTISTS TO ADMIT THEIR WRONG IS HARD AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE EACH OTHER TO DO I THINK MORE AND AND MORE PUBLICLY AND I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO DO THAT ARE REALLY BRAVE AND SO THAT WAS MY POSITION AND THEY ALL AGREED AND THE LONG STORY SURED HERE IS THAT TWO AND A HALF YEARS A THOUSAND PAPERS LATER WE ALL VERY REASONABLY CAME TO CONSENSE US THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE FOR FACIAL EXPRESSIONS OF EMOTION BEING UNIVERSAL AND THAT INSTEAD WHAT IS WHAT THERE'S CLEAR EVIDENCE OF IS UM THAT FACIAL EXPRESSIONS THE WAY THAT PEOPLE MOVE THEIR FACE IS IN IN IN MOMENTS OF EXPRESSION IS HIGHLY VARIABLE MEANING SOMETIMES IN ANGER YOU SCOWL MADA ANALYSIS SO STATISTICAL SUMMARIES OF MANY MANY MANY STUDIES EVEN IN THE WEST SHOW THAT PEOPLE SCOWL AABOUT THIRTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE TIME WHEN THEY'RE ANGRY WHICH IS MORE THAN CHANCE SO GET YOU GOOD PUBLICATION AND YOU KNOW THE PRECEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY BUT THAT BEIN SIXTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE TIME PEOPLE ARE MOVING THEIR FACES IN OTHER MEANINGFUL WAYS THAT'S NOT SCOWLING SO IF YOU ACTUALLY USED A SCOWL OR EVEN YOU KNOW A SCOWL AND BLOOD PRESSURE OR YOU KNOW JUST MAYBE NOT ONE SIGNAL BUT SULK A COUPLE SIGNALS BUT YOU WOULD BE WRONG MORE THAN HALF THE TIME YOU WOULD MISS MORE THAN HALF THE CASES AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY I THINK THAT THAT'S THE RELIABILITY QUESTIONS SO THERE'S LOW RELIABILITY FOR UM THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN A SC OWL AN ANGER IT'S ABOVE CHANCE SO SCOWLING IS ONE EXPRESSION OF ANGER BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE DOMINANT ONE AND THERE IS NO DOMINANT ONE IT'S JUST HIGHLY VARIABLE DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION THAT YOU'RE IN SO SOMETIMES WHEN I'M ANGRY I SIT QUIETLY IN PLOT THE DEMIES OF MY ENEMY YOU KNOW SOMETIMES I SMILE IN ANGER SOMETIMES I CRY IN ANGER IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE SITUATION IM BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY HALF OF THE SCOWLS THAT PEOPLE MAKE ARE NOT RELATED TO ANGER THAT MEANS THAT THE SPECIFICITY IS AGAIN HIGHER THAN CHANCE BUT NOT THAT MUCH HIGHER THAN CHANCE SO IF YOU SEE SOMEONE SCOWLING THE CHANCES ARE THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE ANGRY THEY MIGHT BE CONCENTRATING REALLY HARD OR THEY MIGHT HAVE GAS I MEAN THERE ARE LOT OF REASONS WHY PEOPLE MAKE A SCOWL IM AND WITH WE FOUND THIS FOR EVERY EMOTION CATEGORY THAT HAD EVER BEEN STUDIED AND I WANT YOU TO NOTICE WHAT I JUST DID THERE I'M NOT I'M NO LONGER REFERRING TO UNEMOTION AS IF IT'S AN ANTITY OR A THING THOUGH ANGER ISN'T ONE THING IT'S A CATEGORY OF THINGS A GROUPING OF THINGS AND IF I'ME NOT MISTAKEN IT INCLUDES VERBS RITTI LIKE ANGER AS A SET OF VERBACTIONS IN IN THE BRAIN AND BODY YES IT'S A PROCESS IT'S ANT ON OF IT EXACTLY IT'S NOT A NOUN IT'S A VERB AND IT'S A AND IT'S A PROCESS BUT THE POINT IS THAT AM IT'S IT'S A HIGHLY VARIABLE GROUPING OF INSTANCS IF YOU'RE IF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT ALL INSTANCES OF ANGER ALL INSTANCES OF ANGER THAT YOU HAVE EVER EXPERIENCE OR WITNESSED IM IT'S A HIGHLY VARIABLE GROUPING OF INSTANCES THAT VERY NOT THEY THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE RANDOM BUT WHAT THE BODY DOES IN ANGER DEPENDS ON WHAT THE PHYSICAL MOVEMENTS WILL BE IN ANGER AND THAT DEPENDS ON THE SITUATION THAT YOU'RE IN AND WHAT YOUR GOAL IS AND IM AND THERE ARE WAYS TO TALK ABOUT THAT IN NOROU SCIENCE TERMS WHICH ARE A LITTLE MORE PRECISE BUT THE IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND HERE I THINK IS THAT WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT WESTERN CULTURES NOW THE MINUTE THAT YOU GO OUTSIDE OF THE WEST TO AT OR EVEN TO THE EAST I MEAN SO YOU KNOW THERE ARE OTHER CULTURES YOU KNOW THEY HAVE BEEN STUDIED IM LIKE E CHINA AND CULTURES IN CHINA AND JAPAN IN CAREA THERE THEY ALL HAVE ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WESTERND CULTURE AL PRACTICE IS ENORM SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO YOU KNOW TO REMOTE CULTURES WHICH IM HAVE MUCH LESS ACCESS AND THEY IS NOT LIKE THEY HAVE NO ACCESS BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A GLOBALIZED WORLD SO EVEN HUNTER GATHERERS AND TANZANEA THE HADZA HAVE ACCESS TO WESTERN PRACTICE IS ENORMOUS BUT MUCH LESS MUCH LESS AND WE DID DO THAT AND IM AND ALL BETS ARE OFF THERE I MEAN MOST OF THE TIME THEY DON'T EVEN THEY DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND OR EXPERIENCE FACIAL MOVEMENTS AS HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH EMOTION SO IF THEY SAW IN A MOGY OF A SMILI FACE WOULD THEY JUST ASSUM IT WAS A COMTHEY MIGHT THINK IT'S A FACE THE BECAUSE THAS WE BUT ANOTHER SOME FAIRLY HARD WIRED BRAIN CIRCUITRY FOR THE THE TWO EYES AT AND AT AND A LINE BENEATH IT AND SOMETHING IN THE MIDDLE THIS SUTO KNOWS THAT ORGANIZATION OF OF JUST SPACIAL YANTERS CHUSE UP FACE FOR BTAT BUR MOST PRODOUT LALY INTERESTING AT YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE YES OF COURSE THAT'S TRUE BUT IT'S NOT THERE AT BIRTH WHAT'S THERE AT BIRTH IS A PREFERENCE FOR THAT CONFIGURATION RIGHT SO IT'S IT'S LIKE THEIR SUM AND WE COULD TALK ABOUT WHY THAT'S THEIR EXACTUALLY VERY CONTROVERSIAL BUT IM BUT WHAT BABIES WHAT NEWBORN'S ORIENT TO THEY ORIENT TO THAT OR THEY ORIENT TO THAT CONFIGURATION BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EFACE AND THEN VERY QUICKLY THEY START LEARNING FACES BECAUSE THEY'RE POSED TO FATE THAT MEAN REALLY THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF LIFE IS ALMOST LIKE A MASSIVE CONTINUOUS TUTORIAL ON WHAT FACES ARE BECAUSE THEYRE YE OWT BEING FED AND N EVERYONE'S EIN YOUR FACE SO LARING ME LAST NIGHT AND YOU SE THE BABY IS FRIENDS O ON AB UNBELIEVABLY KEUP BABY THE BIG CHEEKS IN YOU WAT AND THERE' TIS DESIRE TO SEE THE BABY SMILE RI GLAD DO THE THINGS THAT AN AVE THAT THE BABY SHOWS SOME SORTOF FACIAL EXPRESSION THAT MAKES IT SEEMG LIKE IT'S A LITTLE BIT EM LIKE RESISTIN WHAT YOU DO YOU STOP DOING IT YOU CHANGE UP YOUR STRATEGY AND AN WHEN E BABY CRACKS A SMILE AKENOW IM GOING TO ASSUME THAT THE BABE MAYOR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN HAPPY INSIDE IM THAT WOLL BABY HAD UM BUT WHEN THEY DO THERE'S A RESTIPRACITY THAN WE SMILE ACTLY AS THAT THAT THERE'S A TEMPLET THAT THAT'S VERY ROBOS STRIPE BUT I WANT YOU TO NOTICE SO THAT SO FIRSIALL I'M NOT SAYING THAT IM THAT RECOGNIZING FACES A FACE AS A FACE IS NOT HARD WIRED IT IS BUT IT'S HARD WIRED BY NOT BY GENES ALONE RIGHT AND IN FACT THERE'S A REALLY WONDERFUL BOOK CALLED NOT BY GENES ALONE PASICALLY THERE'S CULTURAL INHERITANCE WE HAVE THE KIND OF NATURE THAT REQUIRES IN URTURE WE HAVE THE KIND OF GENES THAT REQUIRE EARLY LEARNING WE HAVE WE NEED WIRING INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE WORLD TO GET THE REST OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO BE COMPETENT CULTURALLY COMPETENT IN OUR IN OUR IN OUR LIVES AND THAT STARTS AT BIRTH IT PROBABLY STARTS BEFORE BIRTH EVEN IM BUT IM IN THIRD TRIMASTER THERES SOME EVIDENCE OF LEARNING FEEDAL LEARNING EVEN IN THE THIRD TRIMASTER SO IM THE POINT IS NOT THAT PEOPLE AREN'T HARD WIRED FOR VIEWING FACES ARE RECOGNIZING FACES USJUS WHERE DOES THAT HARD WIREING COME FROM IT'S NOT BY GENES ALONE GENES AREN'T THE BLUE PRINT THE BRAIN IS EXPECTING CERTAIN IMPUTS FROM THE WORLD AND NEEDS THAT BECAUSE INFANT BRAINS ARE WIRING IN THEMSELVES TO THEIR WORLD AND PART OF THAT WORLD AS PEOPLE MAKING FACES AND SMILING AND THOSE PEOPLE HAPPENE TO ALSO BE TH ONES WHO ARE MAINTAIN WHO ARE MAINTAINING THAT BABY'S NERVOUS SYSTEM MEAN THERE IS REWARD LEARNING RIGHT A REINFORCEMENT LEARNING RIGHT OFF THE BAT BECAUSE THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO KEEP YOU COMFORTABLE THEY  ARE THE ONES WHO FEED YOU THEIRE THE ONES WHO HELP YOU GET TO SLEEP AND SO ONE AND SO FORTH AND SO YOU'RE GOIN TO BE VERY VERY SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE CONTINGENCIES OF THEIR BEHAVIOR YOUR BRAIN AS A PATTERN LEARNER'S JUST GOIN TO LEARN THOSE PATTERNS IF WE KNOW THAT SMILING IT MORE YOU KNOW SMILING IS A CU FOR HAPPINESS IT'S CAUSE WE'VE LEARNED IT AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT LEARNING ISN'T HARD WIRED IT JUST MEANS THAT IT THAT INFORMATION GOT INTO YOUR BRAIN BY CULTURAL INHERITANCE WHICH IS A PART OF EVOLUTIONARY THEORY IN THE EXTENDED EVOLUTIONARY SYNTHES IT'S NOT IN THE ORIGINAL YOU KNOW NOT IN THE ORIGINAL A FORMULATION THAT SOME PEOPLE STILL CON TA STICK TO AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TAKING  G ONE DAILY SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEI'RE SPONSERING THE POD CAST G ONE IS A VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT'S DESIGNED TO ME ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITION NEEDS OF COURSE I TRY TO GET ENOUGH SERVINGS OF VITEMENTS AND MINERALS THROUGH WHOLE FOOD SOURCES THAT INCLUDE VEGETABLES AND FRUITS EVERY DAY BUT OFTENTIMES I SIMPLY CAN'T GET ENOUGH SERVINGS BUT WITH G ONE I'M SURE TO GET ENOUGH VITEMENTS AND MINERALS AND THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED AND IT ALSO CONTAINS A DAPTIGENCE TO HELP BUFFER STRESS SIMPLY PUT I ALWAYS FEEL BETTER WHEN I TAKE  G ONE I HAVE MORE FOCUS AND ENERGY AND I SLEEP BETTER AND IT ALSO HAPPENS TO TASTE GRIGHT FOR ALL THESE REASONS WHENEVER I'M ASKED IF YOU COULD TAKE JUST ONE SUPPLEMENT WHAT WOULD IT BE I ANSWER G ONE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY AG ONE THEY'LL TO DRINK G ONE DOT CM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUSS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMIN D THREE K TO AGAIN THAT'S DRINK  ONE DOC COM SLASH HUBERMEN SO IT'S FAR MORE NEWANCE AH THAN IT WAS PRESENTED TO ME IN THOSE TEX BOOKS IN AND IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS OUTRIGHT WRONG ON MANY DIMENSIONS WELL AN I JUST MENTION WHEN ING THEW THIS IS REALLY SERIOUS STUFF LIKE SOMETIMES PEOPLE THINK WELL YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL THIS IS SUCH A BIG DEAL I'LL TELL YOU WHA IT'S A BIG DEAL BECAUSE IN OUR CULTURE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN READ MENTAL STATES OF OTHER PEOPLE BY THEIR FACE AND THEYPBELIEVE IT SO MUCH THAT IT'S IN SHRINED IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LOSE THEIR LIVES BECAUSE JURIES BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN READ REMORSE OR OR THE LACK OF IT AND IN FACT THERE WAS JUST A CASE U YOU KNOW LAST YEAR I BELIEVE WHERE UM YOU KNOW THE INNOCENCE PROJECT I GOT INBALLED BECAUSE THERE WAS A WOMAN WHO WAS ON DEATH ROW AND WHAT PUT HER ON DEATH RO WAS UM A POLICE OFFICERS CLAIM THAT HE COULD READ HER EMOTIONS BY HER THE COMPORTMENT OF HER FACE AND HER BODY AND UM AND YOU KNOW I IT WAS POSSIBLE TO GET A STAY OF EXECUTION SO THAT SHE COULD BE RETRIED AND YOU KNOW UM S I'M NOT SAYING SHE WAS GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY E'M JUST SAYING WHAT PUT HER ON DEATH ROW WAS EVIDENCE THAT WOULD NOT BE ADMISSIBLE IN A SCIENTIFIC UM WAY NOW M AND THERE ARE THERE ARE LOTS OF CASES WHERE JUDGMENTS ARE MADE THAT END UP  IMPACTING PEOPLE'S LIVES IN PRETTY SERIOUS WAYS SO THIS IS A REALLY SERIOUS THING UN IT'S UM IT'S PUZZLING TO ME WHY IT'S SO IT'S GOT SUCH TRACTION THIS IDEA THAT THERE ARE THESE UNIVERSAL UM EXPRESSIONS THAT WE CAN USE TO READ EACH OTHER YOU KNOW UM IT'S IT'S JUST NOT TRUE I MEAN THE SCIENCE JUST IT'S SO OVERWHELMINGLY I FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW SCIENTISTS I DON'T LIKE TO USE THE TEA WORD YOU KNOW THE AFT WORD FACT HE NON'S A SCARY WORD TE WERE TRUTH BUT I THINK IN THIS CASE I FEEL LIKE I CAN I CAN REALLY AT LEAST WITH A LITTLE TEA I CAN I CAN USE THAT YOU PROBABLY HAVE PARTICULAR FACIAL MOVEMENTS THAT YOU MAKE ON A REGULAR BASIS THAT ARE TELLS FOR YOU I KNOW I DO YOU KOW MY HUSBAND CAN LOOK AT MY ACTIONS AND HE CAN MAKE REALLY DECENT GUESSES ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON FOR ME UPSTAIRS RIGHT BUT THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S KNOWN ME FOR THIRTY YEARS ACTUALLY THIRTY EARS TO DAY I SHOUL JUST SAAALY MATTASHOTHER THIRTY YEARS AGO TODAY BUT HE'S YOU KNOW BRAINS ARE PATTERN LEARNERS SO I'M NOT SAYNG THAT EVERYTHING IS RANDOM IN THAT THERE IS IT'S ALL NOISE I'M SAYING THAT THEY'RE JUST AREN'T THESE YOU KNOW UNIVERSAL TEMPLATES THAT JUST IT'S NOT LIKE THAT AND WE REALLY HAVE TO STOP ASSUMING THAT THAT THAT THERE ARE WELL I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU'RE GETTING THAT MESSAGE OUT THEREIN IM VERY THANKFUL THAT YOU HIGH LIGHTED THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS UM THESE MITHS THAT HAVE PROPAGATED AND THAT'S A PERFECT SEGWAY INTO WHAT I WAS ALREADY GOING TO ASK WHICH IS A IT'S BASED ON SOMETHING THAT I THINK IT'S IN VERY MUCH AGREEMENT WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING A PREVIOUS GUESTD ON THIS PODCAST THEN WAS OUR FIRST GUESED EPISODE DOCTOR CARLEDYCE ROTH CALLI GOOD MIND IT STANDFORD INCREDIBLE BY A ENGINEER UM REALLY YOU DON'T POINT OH ONE PERSENT IN HIS YOU KNOW CATEGORY OF SCIENCE AS WELL AS A PRACTISING A PSYCHITRIS SAID SOMETHING WHICH REALLY STUCK WITH ME OVER THE YEARS WHICH I ONCE HEARD HIM SAY YOU KNOW WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW OTHER PEOPLE FEEL AT ALL IN FACT MOST OF THE TIME WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW WE FEEL AND THAT PROMPTED THE QUESTION FOR ME ABOUT HOW GOOD OR POOR ARE WE AT GAGING OUR OWN EMOTIONAL STATES AND IN PARTICULAR AT LABELING THEM BOTH TO OTHERS AND FOR OURSELVES AND AND SO HEAR ST THE THE DIRECT QUESTION IS LANGUAGE SUFFICIENT TO CAPTURE THIS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX THING THAT WERE CALLING EMOTIONS SO FOR INSTANCE THE OTHER DAYI WAS IN NEW YORK WITH MY SISTER THAN SHE LEFT I WENT OUT FOR A BID I WAS HAVING A PRETTY GOOD DAY AN THEN I RETURNED TO THE PLACE WHERE I WAS STAYING AND I WAS HIT WITH THIS FEELING OF INTENSE LONELINESS AND I DON'T KNOW WHY AND THEN I HAD A BUNCH OF IDEAS ABOUT HOW THAT RELATED TO GROWING UP AND NIB I WAS CONSEY FRIENDS THE NEXT DAY AND I'M AN ADULT AND SO I COULD USE SOME TOP DOWN REGULATION AND I UT YOU KNOW MAY BE I'M A LITTLE TIRED RIGHT IN CAUSE I HADN'T SLEPT ASWELL THE NIGHT BEFORE IBEEN PRETTY RESTED RECENTLY AND THEN I ACTULLY WROTE MY JOURNAL AT SAD YOU KNO MAY BE MOST OF FEELING GOOD AS BEING PRETTY WELL RESTED AND NODTED ANY PHYSICAL PAIN THAT'S A BIG PART OF FEELING GOOD IS THE ABSENCE OF FATIGUE AND THE ABSENCE OF PHYSICAL PAIN AND AND THEN I THOUGHT WHILE THAT'S JUST SO BASIC AS LIKE TWO BUILDING BLOCKS IT IS CLEARLY INSUFFICIENT BUT THEN I COULDN'T THINK OF A WORD TO ADEQUATELY DESCRIBE THE EMOTION THAT CAME ABOUT AN HOUR LATER WHEN I WAS FEELING A LITTLE BIT BETTER BUT NOT COMPLETELY BETTER SO WAS I LONELY NOT REALLY NOT ANY MORE WAS I SAD NOT REALLY BUT YOU KNOW AS I HAD HAD IT OUT INTO THE CITY O SING I DON'T REALY HAVE A WORD FOR HOW I FEEL I'M SORT OF OQET NOT GREAT NOT LO YOU KNOW AND SO I THINK THAT WE HAVE EMOTIONAL LABELS I CERTAINLY DO FOR PIQUES YOU KNOW THESE PIQUE EMOTIONAL STATES SUPERHAPPY I LOVED O THE TIME WITH MY SISTER WE IS EVERY YEAR THIS WAS A PARTICULARLY GOOD YEAR FOR US UM TO DO THIS AND AND IT WENT REALLY WELL WE'RE TEXTING BACK AND FORTH HOW GREAT IT WAS I CERTAINLY KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE REALLY DOWN IN IN THE PITS I'VE GOT LANGUAGE FOR THAT BUT THEN THERE'S AS HUGE RANGE IN BETWEEN AND SO I GUESS THE SIMPLE QUESTION IS SHOULD WE EVEN TRUSTHE LANGUAGES A WAY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WER FEELING OR THER ADDITIONAL IF NOT BETTER SIGNALS THAT WE SHOULD PERHAPS LEARNE TO E LABORATE AM OUR UNDERSTANDING OF EMOTIONS WITH SO I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A A SIMPLE ANSWER AND THAT I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A MORE COMPLICATED ANSWER SO THE SIMPLE ANSWER IS NOW LANGUAGE IS NOT SUFFICIENT PERIOD I THINK THE WAY THAT YOU HAVE WELL I SHOULD SAY ONE LANGUAGE IS NOT SUFFICIENT SO ENGLISH IS NOT SUFFICIENT AND PROBABLY FRENCH ON ITS OWN IS NOT SUFFICIENT AND PROBABLY SAHELY ON ITS OWN IS NOT SUFFICIENT ALTHOUGH IT'S VERY INTERESTING THAT THE THE STATES THAT WE MARK WITH WORDS IN EACH A CULTURE SOME OF THEM OVER LAP BUT A LOT OF THEM DON'T AND IT'S VERY VERY USEFUL TO HAVE LABELS OF EMOTION CONCEPTS FROM OTHER CULTURES THAT THAT CAPTURE CONFIGURATIONS A AT LHERA STATE THAT WE WE DON'T REALLY MARK WE DON'T MARK THOSE IN AND FOR DISTINCTIVELY PULL THEM OUT AS AS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER STATES I LOON TO KNOW WHAT SOME OF THOSE ORD OH THERE THE'RE IM I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT THEM WITH ME I MEAN THERE THERE'RE SOME LIKE THERE'S ONE THERE'S A GERMAN WORD WHICH I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE WORD BUT IT'S LIKE IM THE EXPERIENCE OF SOME ONE HAVING A FASE THAT DESERVES A PUNCH I'M SURE SOME ONL TELL US IN THE HELMETS SOME ONE SOME ONE WHO KNOWS GERMANERE SPENC IM THERE PLEASE PUT THAT WORD IN IN THE COMMEC TE DOOR DON'T PUNCH IN ANOTHER ONE THAT'S MY FAVORITE IS IM I'M LIGOT WHICH IS AM IT'S A POLYNESIAN IM HEAD HUNTING A A AMOTION WORD AND IT MEANS IM EXUBERANT O GRESSION IN A GROUP LIKE SOCKER WERE HET ERE HEAD HUNTING I WERE YOU'RE BASICALLY I'M ORE I SHOULD SAY ALSO I'M IN THE MILITARY SO WHEN I WAS LISTENING TAMPIAR ONE DAY COUPLE OF YEARS AGO MUST V BEEN MORE THAN THACIS IN MY BOOK SO IS PROBABLY MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS AGO I WAS LISTENING TO THESE GUYE TALK THES FORMER R I'M IM MILITARY A PERSON I'LL TALK ABOUT BEING I'M DEPLOYED IN A WAR WE'R THEY'RE WITH THEIR BUDDIES AND THERE THEY'RE BASICALLY HUNTING THE ENEMY AND THEY FEEL EXUBERANT LIKE THER YOU KNOW AND AND THER I'S NOT THAT THEY'RE HAPPY BUT THEYRE IT'S PLEASANT AND IT'S VERY INTENSE VERY HIGH AROUSAL IT YOU KNOW AND IN THE MOMENT IT IT SEEMED RIGHT AND THEN THEY COME BACK I'M YOU KNO WHEN THEY ASK THEMSELVES LIKE THEY COME BACK AND SO THERE NOW YOU KNOW THEIR DEPLOYMENTS ENDED NOW THEY'RE BACK HOME IN THEIR LIKE ARE MY APSYCHO PATH LIKE I ENJOY KILLING PEOPLE WHAT IS THIS ABOUT AND I'M THINKING NO NOW YOU JUST EXPERIENCED LIGID AND IF YOU HAD A WORD FOR IT YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S A GROUPY FEELING WHERE YOU'RE ALL IN IT TOGETHER AND IT'S REALLY INTENSE AND YOU KNOW THEY WERE EXPERIENCING THE I'M THE INTENSITY OF OF I'M HAVING THEIR LIFE ON THE LINE AND AND BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR FOR THEIR BROTHERS YOU KNOW AND SISTERS AN IN IN THEIR TROOP FOR AND YO SO I'M THAT THE WUT THEY WOULD REALIZE IS IS A PERFECTLY IT'S PERFECTLY WITHIN THE RANGE OF NORMAL HUMAN VARIATION IT'S JUST THAT IN ENGLISH WE DON'T HAVE A WORD FOR IT REALLY BUT THER'RE WORDS THER ARE CONCEPTS IN OTHER LANGUAGE IS RIGHT OR THEYE NOT THE OTHER ONE LETER LIKE IT'S CALLED GEAGLE WHICH IS WHERE WHEN YOU SEE A BABY WHOSE REALLY CUAND YOU JUST ONE ALIKE I EO AR YYO ES I IF AT KILL OR CHEE AS  EEKS ER JUS LIKE JUMPING AT YOU AND YET YEN N A PARI YOUR DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE GAND YHAD THEY WAS JUST FACING OUT A THEY ONE OF THOSE YE I ANSING BABIES AND YET AND IT'S SISTER LIKE YE IT'S AND THAT I THINK JEGGL IT'S CALL TS EAGLE EAGLE O EGLE NISER FROM THE OTHER OT YE THER WE DID NON YE ELL AT OT I THAT THE THAT THA HES YEDUT YETN E IAN ARE THERE'S ONE IN JAPA THINK THERE'S A JAPANESE WORD FOR THE DESPAIR THAT YOU FEEL WHEN YOU GOT A BAD HAIR CUT REALLY YECAUSE IT'S I MEAN IT'S REALLY IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF FEELING THAND YOU KOW CAUS YOU'VE GOT A LIKE WAFER IT TO GROW YOU KNOW WHATEVER ANY WAYS THE POINTING THAT IS WORDS FOR US MARK PARTICULAR STATES AND THEY'RE NOT ALL THAT THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS THE STATES THAT OTHER PEOPLE IN OTHER CULTURES CARE ABOUT BUT I THERE'S A BUT THE EVEN AGAIN THE PHRASING OF YOUR QUESTION I JUST WANT TO COME BACK TO AND I'M NOT TRYING TO PICK IT YOU BY ELFREE NOWT I LIE AT BUT WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE WHEN YOU SAID MY QUESTION WAS ILL POSED IN YOUR IN THE ANSWER THAT FOLLOWED IT MADE A VERY CLEAR WHY AND I LEARND SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THE A THEN THE NOT EMOTION SYSTEM BUT THE THINGZE PLURAL THAT THAT CREATE EMOTIONS WORK SO I FEELFREE I II GREW UP IN THE SAME CULTURE THAT YOU DID I'M NOT CANADIAN BY BIRTH BUT BUT IN THE ACADEMIC CULTURE YOU KNOW I MEAN THE STUFF THAT WE TAKE ON LINE BY THE WAY FOLKS IS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE CLIN OF HAZING THAT I EXPERIENCE GROWING UP IN A IN ACADEMIC CULTURE AS IT WAS DONE THEN I DON'T KNO IF IT' STILL THAT WAY NOW SO I FEELFREE YET I COM ME TOLER THAN I LOOK WELL NOW I THINK MY POINT IS THAT I'M TRYING A GET AT HERE IS THAT WHEN WE ASK QUESTIONS ANDY OF US ME TO ANYBODY ASK A QUESTION THERE ARE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE'RE MAKING IN ORDER TO ALLOW US TO POSE THE QUESTION AND SOMETIMES WHAT I'M TAKING ISSUE WITH IS NOT THE QUESTION ITSELF BUT IT'S THE ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND THE QUESTION RIGHT AND THIS IS A VERY CLASSIC THING IN PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE WHICH I KNOW I JUST SAID THE PEAWORD PHILOSOPHY WHICH SCIENTISTS DEUNEASUALLY THEY ROLL THEIR EYES BACK IN THEIR HEAD AND FALL OVER WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SO YOU KNOW CAN LANGUAGE IS LANGUAGE SUFFICIENT TO LABEL OR TO T TO GAGE EMOTIONAL STATES KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE AND THIS IS THE ASSUMPTION THAT PEOPLE MAKE THAT THERE'S A STATE IN HERE CALLED AN EMOTION AND NOW I HAVE TO LABEL IT I HAVE TO IDENTIFY IT THAT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS LIKE THAT IS NOT WHAT YOUR BRAIN IS DOING AT ALL AND IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN WHAT I THINK IS HAPPENING AND WHAT I MI BEST TAVAILABLE GAS YOU KNOW LIKE BASED ON WHAT I UNDERSTAND IT'S LIKE NOT EVEN REMOTELY THAT THAT IS JUST NOT A MEANINGFUL QUESTION AT ALL I'M I DO THINK WORDS ARE IMPORTANT I JUST DON'T THINK THAT THEY HAVE TO BE INSUFFICIENT BY VIRTUE OF WHAT THE BRAINS ACTUALLY DOING AND THE WAY THAT I COME OUT THIS IS JUST REALLY DIFFERENT FROM A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES SO REALLY FOR A HUNDRED YEARS AT LEAST I HATE WHEN PEOPLE SAY THINGS LIKE THAT LICE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS BUT IT REALLY IS LIKE FOR FOR A HUNDRED YEARS AT LEAST WHAT PSYCHOLOGISTS AND NARROGH SCIENTISTS DO  RDID AND ARE STILL DOING IS THEY START WITH A FOLK EXPERIENCE A FOLK CATEGORY A COMMON SENSE EXPERIENCE I FEEL ANGRY I'M MAKING A DECISION I'M HAVING A MEMORY IN REMEMBERING SOMETHING THEY START WITH THEIR EXPERIENCE AND THEN THEY GO LOOKING FOR THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF THAT EXPERIENCE IN THE BRAIN EN YOU KNOW IN THE BODY I THINK THAT'S REALLY PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD ACTUALLY USES THOSE CATEGORIES OR HAS THOSE EXPERIENCES A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATION PROCESS OR SHULD ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT STATEMENTS I EVER HEARD IS FROM THE LATE TED JONES ONE OF THE GREATEST NERANATOMIS OF PROBABLY THE LAST FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AH WHICH WAS THE FOLLOWING HE SAID A DRUG IS A SUBSTANCE THAT WHEN INJECTED INTO AN ANIMAL OR A PERSON PRODUCES A SCIENTIFIC PAPER AND MANY HUNDER E YE YOU GA  GETS A SQUARE IN THE FACE CAN  YOUR ALLRIGHT THATME BASICALLY EVERY DRUG DISRUPTS IF TAKEN AN HOUR TO BEFORE SLEEP CHANGES THE AMOUNT OF REMSCANC THAT YOU GET IS SO SO I COULD IMAGINE THAT ALMOST ANY PERTURBATION OF THE LANGUAGE SYSTEM THE BODY THE FACIAL MOVEMENT SYSTEM COULD GIVE YOU A CORDING  A FACT THAT YOU COULD WRITE A PAPER ABOUT YET BUT THAT DOE N'T MEAN IT HAS ANY SEMBLANCE WHATSOEVER TO WAT HAPPENING IN THE WORLD WHEN WE ARE OTHER PEOPLE AANTEMOTIONS AND HERE'S THE YOU KNOW THERE'S SO MUCH IN WHAT YOU SAID THAT I I JUST WANT IS VERIS IT'S VERY SAYING TO TALK TO YOU SO THE FIRST THING I'LL SAY IS THAT EM YOU KNOW WE OFTEN WILL IDENTIFY WE WE IS IN THE YOU KNOW PEOPLE BUT ALSO SCIENTISTS IDENTIFY BIOLOGICAL AM SIGNALS A BY WHAT WE BELIEVE THEM TO MEAN PSYCHOLOGICALLY SO SERATONAN IS IS A HAPPINESS CHEMICAL NO SAERATONAN INVOLVED AS A METABOLIC REGULATOR IT IS A METABOLIC REGULATOR AND WHATEVER IT'S DOING IT'S ALLOWING AN ANIMAL TO SPEND RESOURCE IS WHEN THE ANIMAL THAT ANIMAL'S BRAIN ISN'T SURE THERE'S A REWARD AT THE END OF THAT RIGHT SO WYOU WERE SAYING BEFORE YOU KNOW THE ABSENCE OF FATIGUE THE ABSENCE OF DISCOMFORT THAT'S A THAT'S A PLEASANT FEELWELL YES SO MAYBE SARATONAN HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH PLEASANTNESS BECAUS IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH ENERGETICS RIGHT COURT IS ALL CORTIS ALL IS ON A STRESS FORMONE IT'S NOT A STRESS WORMA I MEAN IT'S A WHORMONE THAT IS SECRETED MORE WHEN THE BRAIN BELIEVES THAT THERE IS A BIG METABOLIC OUTLAY THAT'S REQUIRED THAT'S WHAT STRESS IS BASIGLLY IT'S THE BRAIN BELIEVES THERE'S A BIG METABOLIC OUTLAY THAT'S ABOUT TO BE REQUIRED AND IT MATTERS THESE KIND OF LIKE LITTLE SAMANTIC TWEEKS LIKE THEY MATTER A LOT BECAUSE OF HOW WE DO IS OF HOW WE DO RESEARCH SO I WOULD SAY I DON'T START WITH THE CATEGORIES THAT DERIVE FROM ENGLISH AND MY OWN EXPERIENCE UM I START WITH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM I TRY TO LEARN WHAT IS THE BEST AVAILABLE EVIDENCE FOR HOW THAT NERVOUS SYSTEM EVOLVED HOW IT DEVELOPED HOW IT STRUCK SHURED RIGHT ANATOMY TO ME IS VERY IMPORTANT SOME OF MY BEST HYPOTHESES COME FROM JUST LEARNING THE ANATOMY AN REALIZING ONLY NOTHER'S A CONNECTION THERE THAT'S DIRECT THAT THAT SHOULD MEAN SOMETHING YOU KNOW I MEAN EM I COULD GIVE YOU LOTS OF EXAMPLES OF EM WHERE WE'VE HAD WE'VE MADE DISCOVERYES SOLELY BECAUSE WE NOTICED AN AND A SET OF ANATOMICAL CONNECTIONS AND WERE REALLY CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT THEY MIGHT BE INVOLVED WITH BUT IF YOU STORT WITH THAT PREMIS THAN YOU THINK ABOUT THE BRAIN AND I THINK ABOUT THE BRAIN A REALLY DIFFERENT WAY RIGHT SO I DON'T THINK ABOUT THE BRAIN AS A STIMULOUS DRIVEN ORGAN EM I THINK ABOUT IT MORE LIKE THIS THAT THAT THE BRAIN IS EM FIRST OF ALL THE BRAIN IS NOT RUNNING A MODEL OR WERE MAKING INFERENCES ABOUT THE WORLD ALL THE BRAIN KNOWS ISS ARE SIGNALS FROM THE CENSORY SURFACES OF ITS BODY SO YOUR BRAIN IS MODELLING YOU'RE RETNA AND IT'S MODELLING YOUR COCLIA AND IT'S MODELLING THE CENSORY SURFACES OF THE SKIN AND SURE SIGNALS YOU KNOW ARE YOU KNOW HIT THOSE SURFACES AND THOSE SURFACES TRANSDUCED THOSE SIGNALS AND SEND THEM UP TO THE BRAIN BUT THE BRAIN ONLY KNOWS THE BODY AND ANYTHING IT KNOWS ABOUT THE WORLD IT KNOWS ABOUT THE WORLD THROUGH THE BODY THROUGH THE CENSORY SURFACES OF THE BODY SO THAT'S THE FIRST FOR ME REALLY BIG IMPORTANT POINT THE SECOND IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT I THINK ABOUT THE BRAIN AS BEING TRAPPED IN A DARK SILENT BOX CALLED YOUR SKULL YOU KNOW AND IT'S SO WEARED SAYING THESE THINGS TO YOU YOU'RE SO MUCH YOU KNOW YOU'RE LIKE YOU'RE  REALLY ESTEEMED LIKE  NERUE SCIENTISTS HERE I HAVE EXPLAINING TO YOU NO UT HOW I THINK THE BRAIN WORKS IS JUST VERY YOU KNOW WHEN IT WORN'T FOR OUR AUDIENCE BUT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR EVEN THOUGH YES I KNOW I KNOW THESE FACT BU T IT'S I BELIEVE IT'S ALWAYS A INFORMATIVE TO GO BACK TO THE FUNDAMENTAL SIR BECAUSE I WE FORGET YOU KNOW ASH I WOULD SAY THAT THE A SOME ONE ONCE DESCRIBED AM THE I'LL CALL HIM THE GREAT COSIES A GREAT VISUAL IN THER SCIENTISTS A VISIAL OF NER SCIENTIST TONY MOTHION A FOUNDED THE DEPARTMENT OF OBNERAL SCIENCE IN AN WHY YOU ONCE SET YOUR A REAL INTELLECTUAL IS SOMEBODY THAT CAN APPRECIATE AND WORK WITH A TOPIC AT MULTIBLE LEVELS OF PIRANNULARITY FIRSHI RUT IT'S NOT AB AND OFTENTIMES IT THE THE MORE EXPERTESE OS ASSOCIATE WITH MORE FOCUST ON DETAIL SO I LOVE RETURNING DOW CIN OR BAS AT SO I I THINK THAT MI AT LEAST SO ES CONSID SO I THINK ABOUT THE BRAINS BEING TRAPPED IN THIS BOX AND AM IT'S RECEIVING SIGNALS CONTINUOUSLY FROM THE CENSORY SURFACES OF THE BODY THAT THOSE SIGNALS ARE THE OUTCOMES OF SOME SET OF CHANGES AND THE BRAIN DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE CHANGES ARE IT DOESN'T KNOW THE CAUSES OF THOSE SIGNALS IT JUST KNOWS THE OUTCOMES HAT KNOWS THE SIGNALS THAT'S WHAT I'S RECEIVING AND SO IT HAS TO GUESS AT WHAT THE CAUSES OF THOSE SIGNALS ARE IN ORDER TO STAY A LIFE AM AND SO THAT'S IN PHILOSOPHY CALLED AN INVERSE PROBLEM SO THE BRAIN JUST HAS A MASSIVE CONTINUOUS INVERSE PROBLEM THAT IT HAS TO DEAL WITH ALL THE TIME TAO CAN'T HAV IT DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE INFORMATION NOW IT'S JUST A GUESSING MACHINE IT'S A GUESSING MACHINE SO FOR EXAMPLE AM YOU KNOW IF YOU HERE A LOUD BANG WHAT IS THAT LADBANG COULD BE A CAR DOOR SLAMMING IT COULD BE THUNDER IT COULD BE A CARBACK FIRING IT COULD BE A GUN SHOT THE BRAIN DOESN'T KNOW IT HAS TO GUESS AND IT'S NOT MAKING A GUESS LIKE A INTELLECTUAL GUESS THE GUESS IS A MOTOR PLAN IT'S A PLAN FOR CHANGING THE INTERNAL STATE OF THE BODY IN ORDER TO SUPPORT MOTOR SCELETO MOTOR MOVEMENTS DO I NEED TO RUN DO I NEED TO SHUT THE WINDOW DO I NEED TO GET AN UMBRELLA DO IT YOU KNOW DO A NYDOLE MY BREATH BECAUSE THE CAR IS BACK FIRED YOU KNOW WHAT AR I NEED TO DO SO WHERE DOES THAT PLAN COME FROM WELL IT COMES FROM PAST EXPERIENCE THE EXPERIENCE THAT'S BEEN WIRED INTO THE BRAIN AM BUT THE BUT I THINK THAT THE EVIDENCE SUGGEST THAT WHAT THE BRAIN IS DOING IS BASICALLY REINSTATING BIT'S IN PIECES OF PAST EXPERIENCE SO REMEMBERING ALTHOUGH WE DON'T EXPERIENCE OURSELVES AS REMEMBERING BUT BASICALLY IT'S REIMPLEMENTING ON SAMBLES OF SIGNALS FROM THE PAST THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THE PRESENT IN SOME WAY NOW A BONCH OF THINGS WHICH ARE SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER IN PSYCHOLOGY IS A CATEGORY SO WHAT THE BRAIN IS DOING IS IT'S CREATING IT'S CONSTRUCTING CATEGORY AND IN FACT WE THINK ABOUT THE BRAIN AS A CONTINUOUS CATEGORY CONSTRUCTOR IT'S CONSTRUCTING A CATEGORY OF POSSIBLE FUTURE IS POSSIBLE OUTCOMES POSSIBLE MOTOR PLANS AND HOW DOES IT KNOW WHICH IS THE RIGHT ONE CAUSE IT'S NOT JUST PICKING ONE THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME SAMPLE THAT IT'S REALY IT'S REIMPLEMENTING BUT HOW DOES IT KNOW WHICH ONE WHICH IS THE RIGHT ONE AS THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE WELLI FEEL LIKE IN THE EXAMPLE OF A LOUD NOISE WHAT I EMERELY THOUGHT OF AS YOU WERE DESCRIBING THAT IS THAT MY SYSTEM WOULD BECOME AWARE OF IT I BECOME AWARE OF IT BUT THEN IT'S A QUESTION OF IS THERE ANOTHER LOUD NOISE HOW CLOSELY ARE THOSE LOUD NOISES SPACE IS IT GETTING LOUDER OR LESS LOUD AND THEN SO A BUNCH OF CATEGORIES I IT'S LIKE A BOOKSHELF WITH AN INFINITE NUMBER OF BOOKS BUT THEN WITH THE SECOND LOUD NOISE NOW IT'S JUST YOU KNOW ONE A WING OF THE LIBRARY AND THEN WITH THAT THE NEXT THING THAT HAPPENS AND THE CONTACT IT STARE S NARROWING IN THE PRETTY SOON YOU GET PRESENTED WITH THE BOOK THAT SAYS YOU KOW THE ROOF IS ABOUT HER HEREN AND AND I THINK URURPER YOU'RE ANALOGY THERE IS POINTING OUT TOOTHIGS ONE IS THAT I'M REALLY WHY WHY WHAT THE BRAINS ATTEMPTING TO DO IS TO REDUCE UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE UNCERTAINTY IS SUPEREXPENSIVE NOW SOMETIMES WE LIKE DELIBERATELY YOU KNOW CULTIVATE UNCERTAINTY RIGHT LIKE WE DO NOT YOU KNOW WE DELIBERATELY TRY TO LEARN THINGS WE DON'T YOU KNOW THAT WE DON'T KNOW WEYOU KNOW PUT OURSELVES IN NOVEL SITUATIONS YOU KNOW WE SEEK NOVELTY AND BECAUSE IT'S FUN AND INTERESTING AND WHATEVER SURE BUT IMAGINE EVERY SINGLE WAKING MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE WAS LIKE THAT WHERE YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULDN'T NARROW THINGS DOWN FROM THE LIBRARY TO THE WING TO THE BOOKSHELF TO THE YOU KNOW THE TO THE THE PARTICULAR SHELF ON THAT BOOKSHELF TO THER WHAT YET YOU INTERRIFI YETI WOULD NOT HIMTHAT'S THE LABEL I WOULD GIVE AGAIN WOULD BE TERRIFIED I AS I COULDN'T PLAN ANYTHING OR YOU ANYTHING BEUSE ALL POSSIBILITIES ARE RIGHT IT'S AND IT'S JUST ACTUALLY METABOGALLY UNSUSTAINABLE AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME THERE ARE SOME BRAINS THAT ARE WIRED IN A WAY THAT THEY DON'T PREDICT VERY WELL THEY DON'T CREATE THESE CATEGORIES VERY WELL AND SO THEY'RE THEY'RE DEALING WITH IN REALLY UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNTS OF UNCERTAINTY SO THAT'S ONE THING I IS BUT THE PART OF WHAT'S THE GOAL HERE IF YOU COULD SAY THERE'S A GOAL IS TO REDUCE UNCERTAINTY AND I'M GOING TO GET TO WHY THIS HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH EMOTION IN A MINUTE BUT I JUST NEED TO SET UP THE GROUND ARULES ARE THE ASSUMPTIONS OF YOU KNOW OF WHAT I'M WHAT I'M WORKING WITH HERE SO THE OTHER THING THOUG YOU POINTED OUT WHICH I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT THE I'M NONE OF THIS IS STATIC IT'S ALL EVOLVING OVER TIME RIGHT THE SIGNALS ARE EVOLVING OVER TIME SO BOTH THE SIGNALS THAT ARE CONSTANTLY HITTING THE CENSORY SURFACES OF THE BODY AND MAKING THEIR WAY TO THE BRAIN BUT ALSO THE INTRINSIC SIGNALS IN THE BRAIN IT'S ALL CHANGING OVER TIME SO WHEN WE TALK O BOUT CONTACT THAT'S IMPORTANT HOW IS THE BRAIN MAKING A DECISION ABOUT SIMILARITY LIKE WHAT ARE THE FEATURES THAT ARE SIMILAR IT'S IT'S NOT JUST AT A SINGLE SNAP SHOT AN TIME IT'S ALWAYS HAPPENING DYNAMICALLY OVER TIME RIGHT AND MOST OF THE TIME THOUGH YOU DON'T ASK YOURS YOU DON'T WAIT TO HEAR A SECOND SOUND YOU DON'T YOU'RE NOT DELIBERATELY ATTEMPTING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE SOUND IS YOUR BRAIN IS JUST SORTING IT OUT RIGHT AND IT'S SORTING IT OUT BY NARROWING DOWN THE POSSIBILITIES AND THERE ARE SOME SELECTION MECHANISMS IN THE BRAIN THAT HELP IT GUESS BETTER BUT ALSO THE SIGNALS COMING FROM THE WORLD IM ARE ARE ALSO HELPING TO SELECT WHICH POSSIBILITY AM IS THE RIGHT ONE I LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE OUR SPONSOR INSIDE TRACKER INSIDE TRACKRS A PERSONALIZED NUTRITIAN PLATFORM THAT ANALYZES DATA FROM YOUR BLOOD ENDIAN E TO HELP YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR BODY AND HELP YOU MEET YOUR HEALTH GOALS I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN GETTING REGULAR BLOOD WORK DONE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT MANY OF THE FACTORS THAT IMPACT YOUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURM HEALTH CAN ONLY BE ANALYZED FROM A QUALITY BLOOD TEST HOWEVER WITH A LOT OF BLOOD TUSTS OUT THERE YOU GET INFORMATION BACK ABOUT BLOOD LIPPITS ABOUT HORMONES AND SO ON BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT INFORMATION WITH INSIDE TRACKER THEY HAVE A PERSONALIZED PLATFORM THAT MAKES IT VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR DATA THAT IS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE LIPIDS WITH THOSE HORMON LEVELS AT CETERA MEAN AND BEHAVIOURAL SUPPLEMENT NUTRITIAN ANDOTHER PROTOCALS TO ADJUST THOSE NUMBERS TO BRING THEM INTO THE RANGES THAT ARE IDEAL FOR YOUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH INSIDE TRACKRS ULTIMAT PLAN NOW INCLUDES MEASURES OF BOTH APO B AND OF INSOLENT WHICH ARE KEY INDICATORS OF CARTYOVASCULAR HEALTH AND ENERGY REGULATION IF YOU LIKE TO TRACK INSADE TRACKER YOU CAN VISIT INSIDE TRACKER DOT COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF ANY OF INSIDE TRACKERS PLANS AGAIN THAT'S INSIDE TRACKER DO COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF THERE'S THE SCENE THAT COMES TO MINE FROM THAT MOV BE A THING OF SAVING PRIVATE RHYND WERE THE THE UM THE GUISENT ARE ABOUT TO HIT THE GROUND ON D DAY ARE FLINCHING WITH EVERY CRACK OF GUN FIRE LIKE THE'RUST EVERYTHING'S A STUPEMENTLESS TO MOVE AIN'T AND AND THEN SOME OF THE MORE SEASONED SOLDIERS ARE LITERALLY ET HAVING BULLETS WHIZZING BY THEIR HEAD AND PEOPLE ARE DROPPING DEAD ALL AROUND THEM AND THEY'RE MOVING FORWARD STELIAD AND STABLE AND UPRIGHT AND IN PART WE LOOK AT THAT IN AND SAY OCATE THEIR COURAGEOUST THEIR SEASON MAYBE THEIR DESENSITIZE IN CERTAIN WAYS BUT ACTUALLY IT FITS MUCH BETTER WITH THE IDEA THEY SOMEWHAT YOU'RE SAYING IT FIT'S MUCH BETTER WITH THE IDEA THAT IM THEY HAVE INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE BOTH CONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS KNOWLEDGE THAT SOMETHING RIGHT NEXT TO THEM IS A THREAT BUT NOT A THREAT WORTH RESPONDING TO RIGHT EXACT WHAT IF YIT WERE HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THEM THEY WOULD SO QUITE QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT I WUD DAY ITS IS THAT IT'S A IT'S NOT A YOU KNO I KEEP REFERRING TO THINGS AS SIGNALS AND REALLY IM JUST I'M YU THAT'S LIKE MY GENERIC WORD FOR A QUANTITY OF ENERGY OF SOME SORT YOU KNOW BUT YOUR BRAIN MY BRAIN EVERY BRAIN IS CONSTANTLY MAKING SIGNAL NOISE DISTINCT YOU KNOW LIKE DISTINCTIONS DO I NEED TO CARE ABOUT THIS DO I DO I NOT NEED TO CARE ABOUT THA'S RIGHT AND WE HAVE WAYS OF LEARNING AND WE ALLS HAVE WAYS OF CUING EACH OTHER SO AM YOU KNOW HUMANS USE I GAZED TO CUE EACH OTHER ABOUT WHAT IS SIGNAL IND WHAT IS NOISE RIGHT SO FOU AND I WERE SITTING WERE HELETS SAY WE WERE AUT A COFFEE SHOP AND WE WERE IN A PART OF TOWN THAT I'D NEVER BEEN TO BEFORE AND WE WERE SITTING HAVING COFFEE AND YOU KNOW A LOUD SIREN WENT BY IF YOU TURNED AND LOOKE I'D PROBABLY TURN AND LOOK BECAUSE YOU JUST CUED ME THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING I NEED TO CARE ABOUT IF YOU IGNORED IT I'D PROBABLY IGNORE IT BECAUSE YOU JUST CUED ME THAT I DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT I DIDN'T NEED TO CARE AND WE'RE CONSTANTLY DOING THAT WITH EACH OTHER AND WE ALSO DO IT WITH LITTLE BA ABIES AND WITH KIDS AND THAT'S HOW WE TEACH CHILDREN THIS A SIGNAL THIS IS NOISE THIS YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THIS YOU CAN IGNORE AND SO YET YOU'RE YOUR DESCRIPTION IS PERFECT SO WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO ANY OF THIS HAVE TO DO WITH E MOTION IN ORDER TO ANSWER THAT PART OF THE QUESTION I I WONT A SAY SO O KET YOU'VE GOT THESE SIGNALS THE BRAIN IS LIKE HAS THESE ELECTRICAL SIGNALS GOING ON WE'LL JUST IGNORE THE HORMONAL SIGNALS FOR THE MOMENT CAUS THAT'S COMPLIGANT ONE IS COMPLICANT SO IT'S GOT THERALL THESE ELECTRICAL SIGNALS GOING ON IT'S WHEN IT'S REMEMBERING SOMETHING IT'S JUST BASILY REINSTATING A PATTERN OF SIGNALS AND IT'S GOT THESE SIGNALS COMING IN A FROM THE CENSORY SRFICES O CASE SO WHAT'S SO WHAT IS THE BRAIN DOING IT'S A SIGNAL PROCESSOR SO WHAT IS IT I DON'T MEAN A COMPUTER I MEAN A SIGNAL PROCESSOR IN THE ENGINEERING SENSE SO WHAT'S IT WHAT IS IT DOING WITHOUT GETTING INTO ALL THE DYNAMICS OF PREDICTION AND YOU KNOW WHATEVER BUT THE BRAIN IS DOING IS IT'S SOME IT'S A SEMBLING A SET OF FEATURES IT'S SOME OF THE FEATURES THAT IT'S ASSEMBLING ARE VERY CLOSE IN DETAIL TO THE CENSORY SURFACES OF THE BODY SO IN PRIMARY VISUAL QUARTEC THERE'S A RETINATOPIC MAP THE DETAILS THERE ARE VERY VERY LOW LEVEL LIKE A LINE AND EDGE YOU KNOW SAME THING IN PRIMARY AUDITORY QUARTECS RIGHT IT'S TON OTOPIC SO THEIRE TONES BUT'S VERY VERY VERY LOW LEVEL DETAILS AND WE MIGHT THEREARE MANY MNY MANY MANY OF THESE LITTLE FEATURES SO WE WOULD SAY THERE THERE'S IT'S A HIGH DIMENSIONAL ARRAY LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF FEATURES AND THEN AND LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT ONE STRUCTURE JUST THE CEREBRAL QUARTEC THET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT L JUST BUT WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY IS BASICALLY TRUE OF REALLY THE REST OF THE BRAIN AS WELL IF YOU TAKE THE QUARTES OFF THE SURFACE OF THE CUARTICAL SHEET OFF THE THAT WAVY YOU KNOW GORTICAL SHEET TO GET OFF THE REST OF THE BRAIN THE SUB QUARTICAL PARTS AND YOU STRETCH IT OUT LIKE A NAPKIN YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A COMPRESSION GRADI AND THEY ARE IN THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE NURONS SO AT THE PRIMARY CENSORY AREAS THERE ARE THESE TINY LITTLE PRAMINAL NURONS THAT ARE REPRESENTING THESE LIP THESE VERY LOW LEVEL FEATURES AND THEY FEED INTO BIGGER NURONS WHICH FEED INTO BIGGER NURNS WHICH FEED INTO MORE BIGGER NURONS SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS YOU'VE GOT THIS VERY DETAILED ARRAY BEING COMPRESSED IN ITS DIMENSIONALITY INTIL YOU GET TO THE MIDDLE OF THE BRAIN AT THE FRONT WHERE THERE ARE MANY FEWER NURONS BUT THEIRE BIGGER AND THEY HAVE MANY MORE CONNECTIONS SO IT'S A DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION THAT'S HAPPENING SUGGESTIV MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND A CORRECTLY AND THAT THE AUDIENCE UNDERSTANDS THE PHYSICAL WORLD OBVIOUSLY IS I'M TRANSFORMED BY OUR SENSORY APPARATI THE RETNA THE COCLEA THE THE SENSING NURONS IN OUR SKIN A IT'S PHYSICAL THINGS MECHANICAL PRESSURE LIGHT PHANTON SOUNDWAVES OK THOUGH T THAT'S TRANSLATED INTO NURL CODE WHICH IS CHEMICAL AND ELECTRICAL AND AND THOSE CENSORYINPUTS ARE ARE FAIRLY VAST IN THE O HIGH DIMENSION HIDIMENSIONALITY SO LOTS OF DIFFERENT ORIENTATIONS OF LINES LOT EVEN YOUND EVEN THOUGH IT ORIGINATES WICH JUST THREE A CONFHOTOPIGMENS LOTS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR INCODING DIFFERENT SHADES OF COLOR CONTRAST OK AND ALL OF THAT AND SO YOU'VE LOTS OF LITTLE NURONS TO REPRESENT ALL THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD THAT ARE OCCURRING BUT AS THAT INFORMATION IS PAST FURTHER UP ALONG SYOU' HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH HIGH THE USE OF HIERACHES CAUS THAT'S CONTROVERSION ALIDAYS NOT FOR POLITICAL REASONS BUT FOR ACCURACY REASONS A AS THAT INFORMATION IS PASSED ALONG THERE'S MORE A CONVERGENCE ONTO A SMALLER NUMBER OF LARGER NURONS SO THESE ARE NORS THAT HAVE ACCESS TO A LOT OF INFORMATION BUT IN COARSER FORM RIGHTS SO THEREARE LOW YELLS LIKE LIKE COMPRESSING AN EMPY THREE LIKE HIG WEN EMPY RE COMPRESSES INFORMATION FOR EXAMPLE SO THE QUARTEXES REPRESENTING FEATURES SO I NO REPRESENT I'M JUST USING THAT N A GENERIC WAY BECAUSE THAT'S ALSO CONTROVERSIAL ABOUT EXACTLY HOW IS THE BINKIBUT YE BUT UTFOR NOW AMUSING IT JUST IN A GENERIC WAY SO YOU GO FROM LINES AND EDGES TO A SHAPE LIKE A ROUND SHAPE TO A FACE TO RIGHTS TO YOU'RE YOU'RE BASICALLY YOU'RE YOU'RE IM YOU'RE GOING WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THERE ARE SUMMARIES OF SUMMARIES OF SUMMARIES OF SAMILIS A I HOPE EVERYONE HEARS THAT CAUSE I'VE BEEN IN THIS FIELD IN NOR A SCIENCE A LONG TIME AS YOU MOVE ALONG THE NERACIS FROM THE CENSORY A PATHELIUM NOW ITSOUNDS VERY VERY NOMINCALLY CURISH BUT FROM THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN INWARD YOU'RE GETTING SUMMARIES YE A SON MORE AND MORE SUMMERIES I THINK THATS SO IMPORTANT A THAT'S A THAT'S A LIKE A GAZILIAN DOLL AR STATEMENT  FOR UNDERSTANDING THE NERVOUS SYSTEM SO BUT T EACH OF THOSE POINTS CORRESPOND TO SUME MENTAL FEATURE LIKE A LINE OR AN EDGE OR A CIRCLE OR A SQUARE OR A FACE OR RIGHT BUT BUT NOW THEN YOU WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE IN THE MID LINE AT THE FRONT WHAT ARE THOSE FEATURES WELL THOSE FEATURES ARE THINGS LIKE THE'RE THEY'RE MULTIMODAL SUMMARIES MEANING THEY'RE SUMMARIES OF THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS AND SMELLS AND RIGHT BUT THEAND THEY ARE LOWER DIMENTIONAL MEANING THERE THEIR COARSER SO THE'RE THINGS LIKE THREAT REWARD PLEASURE I MEAN REALLY ABSTRACT THAT'S WHAT ABSTRACT MEANS IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THOSE REPRESENTATIONS HAVE NO CENSORY OR MOTOR MEANING THAT TATIT MEANS THAT THREAT FOR EXAMPLE A SUMMARY CAN HAVE MANY DIFFERENT PATTERNS ASSOCIATED WITH IT AND THE BRAIN IS TREATING THEM ALL AS EQUIVALENT THIS THIS AT TO ME AGAIN FEEL SO SO IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE AS I'M HEARING THIS IN THIS WORD SUMMARIES IS JUST RINGING MY MIND IT' SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE ONE OF THE COOR COMPONENTS OF MY EXPERIENCE OF MY EMOTIONS CAUSE AT'S ALL I CAN REALLY SAY FOR SURE MY SUBJECTIVE INTERPRETATION AND LABELING IN MY OWN EMOTIONS IS THAT THEY ARE PRETTY BROAD BINS LIKE A AGRIVE FOR MANY BROAD BENDS AND SO THAT THAT'S WHERE I WAS EXACTLY WHERE I WAS GOING SO WHAT ABOUT THE WORD ANGER WHERE IS THAT REPRESENTED LIKE WELL THAT'S A THAT'S A ONE OF THESE MULTIMOTAL ABSTRACTIONS IN FACT ANGER IS JUST A COUPLE OF PHONEAMES IT'S A COUPLE OF SOUNDS BUT THOSE SOUNDS THE SOUND OF ANGER CORRESPONDS OVER THOUSANDS OF INSTANCES THAT YOU'VE LEARNED IN YOUR LIFE TO VERY DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF CENSORY MOTOR FEATURES THIT'S RIGHT BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR BODY DURING ANGER CAN VERY WHAT THE WAY YOU MOVE YOUR FACE IN ANGER CAN VERY DEPINNG ON THE SITUATION WHAT YOU SEE SOME ONE ELSE DOING IN ANGER CAN VERY IN SO THE WORD ANGER OR ANY WORD IS ACTUALLY JUST A MULTIMOTOLE SUMMARY OF MANY MANY MANY MANY INSTANCES WHICH ARE IN THEIR CENSORY AND MOTOR FEATURES THE SENSORY AND MOTOR MEANING VERY DIFFERENT  AND IT SEEMS TO ME ARE HIGHLY CONSTRAINED BY DEVELOPMENTAL AND CULTURAL EXPERIENCE I RESOLUTELY CAUSE JUST TO DAY I LEARNED THAT THERE'S A WORD IN JAPAN FOR THE FEELING THAT ONE HAS OF HAVING GOTTEN A HAIRCUT THEY DON'T LIKE THERE'S A WORD IN GERMANY THAT PRETAINS TO THE FEELING OF WANTING TO PUNCH SOME ONE SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF THE LOOK ON THEIR FELL LIES WHO ARE LIKE YOU LIKE YOU THE TO YOU IT FEELS LIKE THEIR ASKING TO BE PUNCHED AND THEVEN IS HOW YOU ADDED YET MORE DIMENTION I ADDIE TO IT SO UPON LEARNING JUST THOSE THINGS JUST TO DAY THERE IS ADDITIONAL DIMENTIONALITY BROUGHT IN SUCH THAT IF I WERE TO EVER AM WANT UPONH SOMEBODY IN THE FACE SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE LOOK ON THEIR FACE THAT I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY LABEL THAT AS ANGER ALONE IT NOW HAS ANOTHER DIMENSION TO IT AND SO  THINK I'M FINALLY I THINK I'M FINALLY STRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE DEVELOPMENTAL AND THE CULTURAL INFLUENCES PLUS THE FACT THAT LANGUAGE IS A PRETTY CRUDE DESCRIPTOR FOR THIS NORAL PROCESS THAT YOU'RE DESCIVED ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY BUT BOOCASE O BIT BEEN BEFORE YOU USE THE WORD GRANULARITY AND SAMGANEUSE THAT WORD TOO IN FACT I IVE COINED THAT PHRASE EMOTIONAL GRANULARITY AM THIS IS AN ASIDE YOU KNOW I COINED THAT PHRASE ALMOST THIRTY YEARS AGO AND NOW PEOPLE STUDY IT LIKE ITS A PHENOMENON WHICH IS COOL IN A SENSE BUT ALSO I CINAUANA KEEPREMINDING THEM LIKE THAT'S A WORD THAT REFERS TO PROCESS IT'S NOT A THING IT'S A PROCESS AND BUT THE PROCESSIS SO WHEN THE BRAIN IS A CATEGORY CONSTRUCTOR HOW FINE GRAINED ARE THE CATEGORIES HOW PRECISE TO THE CATEGORIES RIGHT LIKE IF YOU'RE USING IF YOURE FEATURE OF E QUIVALENTS THAT YOUR BRAIN IS USING ITS THREAT YOU'RE IN REALLY BIG TROUBLE CAS THEY ARE LIKE A GAZILIAN DIFFERENT SENSORY MOTOR PATTERNS THAT COULD GO WITH THREAT SO YOU'RE CATEGORIES GOING TO BE MASSIVE SO HOW DOES THE BRAIN FIGURE OUT WHICH OF THOSE MASSIVE NUMBER OF OPTIONS IS THE ONE TO USE IN THIS IN IN THIS INSTANCE IF ON THE OTHER HAND YOU DON'T JUST WANT TO USE SENSORY MOTOR PATTERNS AS THE FEATURES OF EQUIVALENTS ARE THE FEATURES THAT YOU'RE USE ING TO SAY THIS INSTANCE WRIGHT NOW IS SIMILAR TO THESE PAST INSTANCES IF I HAD TO SEARCH LIKE RIGHT NOW WHAT IS SIMILAR TO RIGHT NOW IT WOULD BE ME SITTING ACROSS HA TABLE FROM SOMEBODY WHO HAS A BEARD AND IS I'M DRESSED IN BLACK AND YOU KNOW THERE THERE AREA LOT OF DETAILS THERE THAT PROBABLY DON'T MATTER RIGHT SO YUYOU'D BE SEARCHING FOR SPECIFIC MATCH FROM THE PAST THAT'S NOT VERY EFFICIENT EITHER SO YOU NEED SOMETHING IN THE MIDDLE AND YOUTHEN THAT IS TO SAY YOU NEED TO HAVE CAT YOUR BRAIN HAS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE CATEGORIES THAT ARE MORE FINE GRAINED BUT NOT SUPERFINE GRANE BUT THEY HAVE TO BE MORE FINE GRAIN THAN JUST THREAT DO YOU WANT TO KEEP IN THE LIBRARY NALEGY THAT I MADE REALLY YOU WANT TO KEEP THE REST OF THE LIBRARY AXCESSIBLE AT SOME LEVEL YOU ASTEL YOU'RE NOT JUST STARING AT THAT ONE BOOK BUT IF YOU USE THE CATEGORY BAD THIS FEELS BAD THEN YOU'RE BRAIN IS BASICALLY I'M GOING TO BE PARTIALLY CONSTRUCTING AN ENTIRE WING FULL OF BOOKS LIKE UP TIRE WING FULL OF OPTIONS IF YOU USE THE WORD ANGRY I'M THEN MAYBE IT'S A BOOKCASE IT'S CONSTRUCTING A BOOKCASE FULL OF OPTIONS AND A CATEGORY THAT'S THE SIZE OF A BOOKCASE AND IF YOU WERE USING THE WORD FRUSTRATED THEN MAYBE IT'S A SHELF THE BRAIN CAN LEARN TO CONSTRUCT CATEGORIES AT DIFFERENT SCALES OF GENGENERALIZABILITY SO IF I'M IN AN INSTANCE AND I'M MY BRAIN IS MAKING A GUEST IS IT DRAWING FROM PAST INSTANCES THAT WE'RE ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD ANGER WE'RE ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD FEAR MAYBE IT'S SOME COMBINATION IT'S THE WORDS ARE JUST FEATURES THERE JUST SOUNDS THERE ARE ALL SO ALL SORTS OF OTHER FEATURES LIKE WHAT WAS MY HEART DOING BU BUT WHAT KIND OF MOTOR ACTIONS DID I MAKE WHAT DID I SEE NEXT  SO THE POINT BEING WITH I'M TRUNNIT BRING HERE IS THAT IT'S NOT LIKE YOUR BRAIN CREATESA AN EMOTIONAL STAYE AND THEN LABELES IT WHAT YOUR BRAIN IS DOING IS CREATING A CATEGORY OF POSSIBLE FUTURES OF WHAT'S GOING TO HAT WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO NEXT AND THAT STATE IS LARGELY DETERMINED BY THE WHAT THE BRAIN IS REMEMBERING AND HOW IT'S DRAWING FROM THAT HUGE POPULATION THAT HUGE LIBRARY OF OPTIONS WHICH BOOKS IS IT SAMPLING I LOVE THI SO MUCH BECAUSE IT EXPLAIN SO MUCH THAT FRANKLY AS EN PERPLEXING TO ME AND ALSO SOMEWHAT TROUBLING TO ME LIKE FOR INSTANCE I A WE HEAR BUT EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE YOU KNOW AND AND SOMETIMES I WONDER WHETHER NOT AM TRUE EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE WOULD BE WHAT YOU JUST  DESCRIBED THE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THIS PROCESS WORK SO THAT YOU CAN WORK WITH IT AND I DEFTLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW ONE CAN WORK WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY POWERFUL IN IT'S A EXPLANATORY POWER BUT ALSO AMITS ACTIONABLE POWER A THE OTHER THING IS THAT IT'S CLEAR TO ME JUST BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE TODAY OF HEARING THESE WORDS FROM OTHER CULTURES THAT RELATE TO DIFFERENT EMOTIONAL STATES THAT THI SYSTEM UNLIKE A LOT OF SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN I LIKE TO THINK IT IS FAIRLY PLASTIC LIKE THE MOMENT THAT YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL DIMENSIONS TO SADNESS ANGER ET CETERA THERE'S SOMETHING COMFORTING ABOUT THAT WHAT'S REALLY UNSETTLING IS THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE SUCH A BROAD BINS THAT WE ARE WE WOULD DEFINE YOU KNOW A NEAR INFINITE NUMBER OF SITUATIONS AS JUST FEAR THAT WOULD SOCK THAT'S NOT A GOOD EXISTENCE AND YET I HAVE TO ASK WHETHER NOT YOU THINK THAT AS A SPECIES NOT AS A CULTURE BUT IN OUR ENTIRE SPECIES WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE TAKING THE EXACT OPPOSITE APPROACH THAT WERE SO MOVING INTO THE IMOGI ISATION IS AT A WORD I'LL MAKE IT A WORD THAND PEOPLE CAN ASSAULT ME IN THE COMMENTS A THE EMOGI IS ATION OF THIS VERY RICH AND COMPLEX SYSTEM WE'RE TARTING TO GET INTO THIS MODE OF LIKE I'M ON OPOST AN ANGRY FACE AND THEREFORE LIKE THIS IS A BAD I'M ANGRY AT YOU THIS IS A BAD INTERACTION WORGAN IT'S ITS UNCOMBAT POTENTIALLY COMBATIVE OR AND YOU KNOW MAY BE UNTWITTER ACTS OR INSTOGRAHAM OR OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA SIDES OR KIND OF THE THE EPIDOMY OF THIS WHERE YOU REDUCE THIS HIGH DIMENSIONAL SPACE IN YOU YOU KEEP THA THE CENSORY STIMULATION VERY HIGH S MOVY AFTER MOVY AFTER MOVY AND COLLER AND SOUND AND PEOPLE DOING CRAZY PARCOURS STUFF AND BERRIS EATING GRAFTS OR WHATEVER IT IS  INTURPYING NOT BEARSEIN DRAUGTS WIT LU YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN AND YOU CAN SEE STUFF THAT SEXUAL AND VIOLENT AND POLITICAL AND EMOTIONAL AND SWEET AND THEN THE CATS ARE KISSING THE MONKEY AND YEAR LIKE OR THE MONKEYS KISSING THE CAT AND SO ITS HIGH DIMENSIONALITY IN TERMS OF CENSORY SPACE BUT THEN WHAT WE CALL IT WERE LIKE OH THIS IS AN AMOGI YOU ASSIGN IN A MOTO YOUR HEARTING SOMETHING YOURE GIVING IT THUMBS UP OR THUMBS DOWN SO I ALMOST FEEL LIKE WE WERE TRING TO A WE WERE REGRESSING TO A STATE WHERE WE'RE KIN LIKE AN INFANT TRYN A FIGURE UT LIKE WHAT THE HEALS GOING ON AND WERE SAYING YOU KNOW IT YOU GET LIKE SIX CATEGORIES OF RESPONSE WHEN IN REALITY A WE SHOULD PROBABLY BE EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT RESPONSES THAT WE CAN HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCURATELY MATCH THE WAY THAT OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM ACTUALLY WORKS YES EXACTLY THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT THINGS WE CULD TALK ABOUT WITH RESPECT TO THE SUMMARY THAT YOU DESCAPE WHICH I  I THINK IS COMPLETELY ACCURATE SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT IF YOU LOOK THROUGH EVEN JUST THE LAST I DON'T KNOW HUNDRED SAR SO YEARS LIKE THE NINETEENTH YOU KNOW NINETEENTH TWENTIETH CENTURIES MAYBE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE COMPLEXITY OF THE OF PEOPLES RESPONSES EXPANDS AND CONTRACTS RIGHT SO FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IAVE WRITTEN REALLY SPECUTIVELY ABOUT AM BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FOUND REALLY INTERESTING AM IS THAT KNOW AUTHORITARIANISM AUTHORITARIAN THINKING IS THE REDUCTION OF COMPLEXITY TO SOMETHINGS THAT ARE REALLY REALLY SIMPLE LIKE YOU'R GETTING RID OF ALL THE COMPLEXITY TO YOU KNOW BASICALLY THESE VERY VERY COURSE LOW DIMENSIONAL JUDGMENTS AND THINGS BECOME BLACK AND WHITE M IT'S THE AVOIDANCE OF COMPLEXITY EM SO THAT THERE CAN BE SIMPLE SINGLE ANSWERS TO THINGS AND IT HAPPENS IN HUMAN CULTURE AT TIMES AND THEN THEN THERE'S AN EXPANSION OF COMPLEXITY AT TIMES TOO SO WHAT PREDICTS THAT LIKE WHAT IS IT IN THE HUMAN NERVOUS SYSTEM OR OUR COLLECTIVE HUMAN NERVOUS UNOLIQEUERE WERE JUST A BUNCH OF BRAINS ATTACHED TO BODIES IN ER ACTING WITH OTHER BRAITS AND BODIES RITS A LIKE WHAT IS IT THAT CAUSES THESE UM RIPPLES OF AND AND I HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT THAT ARE REALLY REALLY REALLY SPECULATIVE EM BUT I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT'S THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ITS WE'LL GO BACK TO OUR OUR CORTICAL SHEET THAT WE'VE AND BY THE WAY THIS JUST JUST ONE COMPRESSION GRADIANT AND THE BRAIN THERE ARE OTHERS TO RIGHT UM THERE AT LEAST FOUR OTHERS THAT I CAN THINK OF EM SO THIS IS JUST ONE BUT ALL COMPRESSION GRADEDS WORK THE SAME WAY WHICH IS THAT ENOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT GOING FROM THE LOW LEVEL DETAILS M COMPRESSING TO THESE MULTIMODAL SUMMERES THES REALLY LIKE SIMPLE UM FEATURES THAT ARE RIGHT BUT THAT COMPRESSION IS WHAT ENGINEERS WOULD CALL LOSSY MEANING YOU LOSE THE INFORMATION YOU LOSE THE INFORMATION SO WHEN YOU GO FROM LINES AND EDGES TO A FACE THOSE NURONS THEY JUST KNOW THE FACE THEY DON'T HAVE THEY LOSE WHAT THEY'VE THROWN AWAY THE DETAILS THEY'VE THROWN AWAY THOSE DETAILS ARE GONE FOR THOSE NURONS THAT REPRESENTI IIT ARE OF ACCESS  THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO IT WE KNOW SO WE SAID WELL THE BRAIN IS MAKING A GUESS I'S MAKING A GUESS ABOUT WHAT THESE WHAT THIS BIG VERY VERY HIGH DIMENSIONAL YOU KNOW SOUP OF SIGNALS IN THE WORLD AND IN THE BODY LIKE WHAT ARE THEY MEAN RIT WHEN THE BRAIN MAKES A GUESS IT STARTS WITH THE COMPRESSED LOW DIMENSIONAL SIGNALS IT STARTS WITH THE FEATURES LIKE ANGER OR LIKE THREAT OR IT STARTS WITH THESE SUMMARIES AND THAT IT HASS TO INFUR OR GUESS AT EVERY SYNAPS THERE'S A GUESS THAT'S BEING MADE ABOUT WHAT THE DETAILS ARE AT THE NEXT LEVEL BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE GUESS IS BASICALLY THE BRAIN GOING FROM THESE REALLY GENERAL THINGS TO THESE VERY SPECIFIC CENSORY MOTOR PATTERNS IT HAPPENS ALONG THE CORTICAL SHEET IT HAPPENS ALSO DOWN THE NURAXIS DOWN THE NUR YOU KNOW FROM THE QUARTEX TO THE MIDBRAIN TO THE BRAINSTEM TO THE SPINAL CORD YOU HAVE TO GO FROM A REPRESENTATION OF YOU KNOW RUN TO THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL MOVEMENTS OF MUSCL SPENDALLS AND YOU KNOW ANGLES OF JOINTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOUARE GOING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION YOU'RE ADDING DETAIL YOU'RE PARTICULARIZING AND THE BRAIN IS GUESSING IT'S GUESSING WELL IF IT'S USING ANGER AS THE GENERAL FEATURE WELL WHICH IT WHICH INSTANCE OF ANGER IS IT AND WHAT ARE THE SPECIFICS THAT ARE GOING TO HAPPEN AND OUT OF THAT WOULDN'T IN FORGIVE ME BUT AND WHAT ARE THE ADAPTIVE STEPS THAT I MIGHT TAKE ER NOT TAKE IS OM QUOTING ALOT TO DAY SO FORGIVE ME BUT IN THE WORDS OF THE GREAT SHARRINGTON NOBLE PRISE WHEN HI PHYSIOLOJUST THE FINAL COMMON PATHWAY IS MOVEMENT MIS MOVEMENT AND THAT AND MOVEMENT IS NEW ANT STRIHE HUMANS I ISPUST HAVE AMONG THE GREATEST VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SPEEDS AND TYPES OF MOVEMENT I THINK ABOUT PARCOR GYMNASTICS THINK ABOUT THEN WHAT LIKE A IT A CHEEDUCK CAN DO CHEET US ARE IMPRESSIVE A GYMNIST IS TRULY IMPRESSIVE IN TERMS OF THE RANGE OF MOVEMENTS AND SPEEDS ET CETERA IN ANY EVENT THE ULTIMATE CHOICE OF THE NERVOUS IST EM AS TO MAKE IS WETHER NOT TO MOVE WHICH DIRECTION HOW FAST OR STAY STILL MA FORWARD MOVE BACK AND AND I JUST ALL JUST ADD ECAUSE I I'M HOPING THAT YOU'LL EXPAND ON THIS UM IT'S BEEN SAID BEFORE THAT ULTIMATELY THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS TRYING TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT YUM YUCH OR ME LIKE THEY CIM MA GAIN MOVE TOWARDS SOMETHING IF I CAN MOVE AWAY FROM IT OR MY JUST GET A STAY PUT WELL THEN ONLY THAT'S ONLY IT THAT THA THE THA THAT'S A VERY THAT I WOULD SAY THAT THOSE ARE VERY LOW TO MENSION ALL FEATURES THOG THOSE ARE THOSE COMPRESSED FEATURES BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING THE BRAIN HAS TO DECIDE THAT'S JUST A MISNOMER WELL GET THAT I CAN GET OUT OF THAT LOW PICKLE THAT I PUT MYSELF IN BY SAYING THAT I DIDN'T SAY THAT I KNO NOW I WON'T GOT WHO DID CAUSE NOW I VERY FAMOUS NORSIDE TO TTT BUT HE TRYD TO REDUCE IT ALL HE'S AT CALTACK IT AM  HE'S NOT SOMEBODY YO STUDIES EMOTION HE STUDIES THE VISUAL SYSTEM BUT HE SAID T AT YOU KNOW THAT THAT THERE'S A THAT THAT THE NERL CIRCUITS MUSECAUSE HE STUDIES MICE OR OR SENTIALY BEND IN TO A YUM YUHAN ME OUTPUTS AND AND I I'VE ALWAYS LIKED IT ON THE ONE HAND CAUS THREES WORK AND IT'S SIMPLE BUT RARELY IS THE WAY THAT WE DESCRIBE THINGS THE WAY TO ACTION AN MER A WE WOULD YOU KNOW IN N STUDYING HUMANS WE WOULD SAY WHELL THAT'S AFFECT THAT THE AFFECT THAT'S MOOD OR YOU NOWS JUST LIKE IS IT IS IT I'M SHOULD I MOVE TOWARDS IT IS IT PLEASANT SHAT I MOVE AWAY FROM IT IS IT UNPLEASANT OR YOU KNOW IS IT IRRELEVANT BASICALLY I DON'T CARE O CAY THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE FEELING HORRIBLE HE JUST FEEL YOU FEEL WHO YOU JUST FEEL YOU FEEL BAD WOULDO YOU DO YOU DON'T KNOW T YOU DON'T NO BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE A PLAN OF ACTION AND THAT'S ULTIMATELY THAT IS WHAT THOSE THOSE COMPRESSED LIKE SUMMARY FEATURES THOSE VERY LOW COARSE FEATURES THEY HAVE TO BE DECOMPRESSED INTO DETAILS OTHERWISE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO ULTIMATELY WHAT THE BRAIN IS DOING IS ITS SAMPLING FROM THE PAST BASED ON SIMILARITY TO THE PRESENT TO PLAN AND ACTION AND WHEN I SAY ACTION I DON'T JUST MEAN SKELETAL MOTOR ACTION LIKE MOVING A LIMB IT YOU THE FIRST ACTIONS THAT ARE PLANED ARE THE ACTIONS OF CO ORDINATING THE HEART AND THE LUNGS AND YOU KNOW ALL OF THE INTERNAL ACTIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THE MOTOR THE SKELETO MOTOR MOVEMENT SO YOUR BRAIN IS MAKING A IS CATEGORIZING INS MAKING  ITS ITS CREATING A CATEGORY AND ITS THEIR ARE OPTIONS THERE THOSE OPTIONS THE MOTOR PLANS BEGIN WITH SHOULD THE HEART BEAT FASTER SHOULD T BE SLOWER DOES BLOOD PRESSURE NEED TO GO UP SHOULD THE YOU KNOW SHOULD THE BLOOD VESSELS CONSTRICT OR SHOULD THEY DILATE TM SHOULD T BREATHING BE DEEPER OR SMORE SHALLOW I MEAN THOSE ARE THE FIRST PLANS THAT GET MADE AND THEN MILLA SECONDS LATER THERE ARE THE SKELETOM MOTOR PLANS AND THEN YOUR EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD DERIVES FROM THOSE MOTOR PLANTS THOS VICERO MOTOR THAT IS THE PLANS FOR THE VICERA FOR THE INTERNAL ORGANS AND THE SKELETO MOTOR SOME JUST CONFER THEM AS MOTOR THOSE MOTOR PLANS ACTUALLY GIVE RISE TOU EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD THERE'S NOT SOME STATE THAT EXISTS AS AN EMOTIONAL STATE WHICH THAN YOU APPLY A LABEL TO THE LABEL IS A JUST A SET OF FEATURES THAT ARE USEFUL FOR GENERALIZING FROM THE PAST TO THE PRESENT AND THE BEN SIZE OR THE THE YOU KNOW OF OF WHAT A WORD REFERS TO CAN CHANGE IT CAN CHAIN IT'S DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND IT CAN CHANGE IN YOUR LIFETIME AND YOU CAN ADD NEUBINS THAT IS YOU CAN SO FOR EXEMPLE THEREIS A THERE IS A CONCEPT GUSKIN LOOK WHICH I PR ABLY JUST BUTCHERD SO IF YOU SPEAK TURKISH I'M SORRY BUT IT'S LIKE THEM IT HAS FEATURES OF IT OF LIKE LOSS AND UM LIKE PEOPLE BLOCKING YOUR GOALS SO WE WOULD SAY IT'S ANGER AND SADNESS TOGETHER THAT'S GISCAN LOOK WHEN YOU LOSE SOMETHING IN YOUR PISSED OFF ABOUT IT AM THAT'S A BUT THAT'S A CATEGORY ON IT'S OWN RIG ITS JUST A DIFFERENT WAY OF PARCING THAT THAT THAT REALLY DETAILED SOUP AND THE MORE WORDS YOU KNOW THE MORE WORDS ARE JUST USEFUL FOR POINTING TO A SET OF FEATURES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER SO WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS IF I SAY TO YOU ANDREW I HAD PETS A LAST NIGHT FOR DINNER PET'S A TWO SOUNDS TWO SYLLABLES THAT THOSE TWO SYLLABLES SAT THEY STAND IN FOR LIKE FIFTY DIFFERENT CENSORY AN MOTOR FEATURES CAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO SAY TO YOU I HAD A FOOD I DIDN'T HAVE PEACE LESSNIGHT BUT LETS SAY GIT I HAD A FOOD THAT WAS ROUND AND FLAT AND HAD SOSS AND ALSO CHEESE AND IT IT HAD MUSERELACHEES AND ALSO LITTLE PARMAGONCHEESE AND IT HAD MUSHROOMS ON IT AND A LITTLE BIT OF I'LL LIVE AND YOU KNOW AM THAT'S LIKE REALLY REALLY A DETAILED AND COMPLICATED BUT INSTEAD I CAN JUST SAY IAD PET'S A TWO FEATURES TWO SOUND TWO SYLLABLES PHONIMES AND WITH THOSE TWO PHONAMES I HAVE JUST COMMUNICATED TO YOU IN YOUR BRAIN MY BRAIN HAD FIFTY FEATURES IT WAS REPRESENTING OF DETAILS AND NOW I HAVE JUST COMMUNICATED THOSE TO YOU OR SOME NUMBER OF THEM WITH TWO SOUNDS VERY EFFICIENT NOW OF COURSE YOU MIGHT THINK THAT I WAS FROM CHICAGO AND HAD DEEP DISH PETZA AND I'LL JUST RESIST I DON'T WANT I LIKE OFFEND ANYBODY FROM CHICAGO IT'S NOT YAT'S NOT ALSS THAT THAT'S NOT REAL PETS AM WRITS SO YOU COULD THEN ASK ME OH WAS IT BUT YOU'RE FROM CHICAGO IS THAT DEEP DISH BEE SUN THAN I WOULD SAY NO NO I'M ACTUALLY FROM TERONA WHICH IS JUST LIKE NEW YORK AND SOME NOT WISE THIN CRUSTPEATS WHICH IS REALLY THE ONLY KIND OF PIECE OF THERE IS JUST SAYING BUT YOU DON'T BUT MY POINT IS THAT WORDS ARE JUST STAND IN FOR THEY'RE JUST LOWTTHIESE LIKE LOW DIMENSIONAL FEATURES THESELESE SOT OF GROSS FEATURES THAT STAND IN FOR MANY MANY MANY MANY LITTLE DETAILED FEATURES AND THAT'S HOW WE COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER AND TEN WE ARE CONSTRAINED BY YOU KNONT WHAT WE KNOW IN ARE YES SO THEN WHAT WE CAN SAY AND OUT OF THE XTENT OF ORROCA AND I'LL JUST SAY THAT LITTLE BABYES THREE MONTHS OLD THEY DON'T SPEAK YET AND THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND LANGUAGE BUT THEY CAN USE WORDS TO LEARN ABSTRACT CATEGORIES SO WE ABSTRACT JUST MEANS THAT THAT THE WORD REFERS TO MANY DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF CENSORY MOTOR FEATURES SO THE WORD IS EM OR THE CATEGORY THE THINGS THAT MAKE THE INSTANCE IS SIMILAR EM ARE A FUNCTION EM WERE GOAL NOT LIKE THE CENERY MOTOR FEATURES SO YOU SAY TO A BABY VERY EXPLICITLY LIKE A CAUSE OF GRETOGIG ABOUT THREE FOUR MONTH OLD BABYES RIPE BABIES CAN ALSO DO THIS IMPLICITLY TO EM BUT IN EXPERIMENTS YOU SAY TO A BABY LOOK SWEETY THIS IS A BLING AND YOU PUT THE BLING DOWN AND IT MAKES A BEAPING NOISE AND THEN YOU SAY NOW THIS LOOK DIFFEREND FEELS DIFFEREND RIHT SMELLS DIFFERENT LOOK SWEETY THIS IS A BLING IT BEAPS NOW YOU TAKE SOMETHING ELSE WHICH ALSO IS DIFFERENT AND YOU SAY LOOK SWEETY THIS IS A BLING NOW THE BABY EXPECTS THIS TO BEAP BY THE WAY FOLKS JUST LISTENING AT LEAST A JUST I GAVE THREE SAMPLES FIRST WITH A PEN THEN A COFFEE MUG AND THEN HER VERY OWN WATCH A THREE VERY DISTINCT OBJECTS BUT ALL OF WHICH MAKE A THAT ARE TOLD A THE BABY IS TOLD MAKE AA BLING SOUND AND THEY WILL BEEN THOSE THREE YE VISUALLY DISTINCT OBJECTS FUNCTINALLIYG DISTINCT OBJECTS INTO ONE SINGLE BEN BECAUSE THEY MAKE U THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE SHARING A FUNCTION WHICH IS TO BE I THINK THIS IS SO IS SO IMPORTANT AND I AM AND IF I MAY I I I WANT TO ASK WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN TAKE THIS INCREDIBLE UNDERSTANDING OF EMOTIONS THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WELL REALLY TALKING ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN MY MY VERSION OF HOW THE BRAIN WORKS AND HOW EMOTIONS EMERGE OUT OF THEIRS THIS TEMBASICALLY AND AND ABSOLUTELY AM YE DESCRIBED IT FAR BETTER THAN I COULD AND AND AN ANCHOR THAT TO THIS CONCEPT OF MOVEMENT T THE MOVEMENT IS THE FINAL COMMON PATH WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MOVEMENT SYSTEM AND FORGIVE ME BUT THAT WE HAVE SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT ALLOW US TO MOVE THAT'S FOR SURE SYSTEMS PLURREL THAT THEY RUN IN BOTH DIRECTIONS IN OTHER WORDS HOW WE FEEL WHAT WE FEEL OUR EMOTIONS HAS SOME BEARING ON THE MOVEMENTS THAT ARE MORE OR LESS LIKELY FOR US IN A GIVEN CONTACT AND OUR MOVEMENTS CLEARLY CAN ALSO INFLUENCE THE WAY THAT WE FEEL INTERNALLY WELL I WELL I MEAN SO IF EM IF WE JUST LOOK AT HOW THINGS ARE HAPPENING HEREIS HERE IS WHAT THE ANATOMY TELLS US THAT WHEN THE BRAIN MAKES A GUESS THAT GUESS STARTS AS A MOTOR PLAN STARS IS A VITERAL MOTORPLAN IN A SKELETER MOTORPLAN SO HEARTRAY CHANGES BREATHING CHANGES WHAT PRESSURE CHANGES AND AND POTENTIALLY SKELTAL MUSCLE MOVEMENT IT AND LITERAL COPIES LITERAL COPIES AFFIRENT COPIES OF THOSE SIGNALS ARE SENT TO THEY PROPAGATE TO THE CENSORY AREAS TELLING THE BR RAIN TELLING THOSE NURONS THIS IS THE LAST TIME WE MADE THIS IN THIS CONTEXT WHEN THIS OTHER STUFF JUST HAPPENED THE LIKE THIS TEMPORAL CONTEXT TRIGHT THAND WE MADE THESE MOVEMENTS HERE IS WHAT WE SAW NEXT HERE IS WHAT WE FELP NEXT HERE IS WHAT WE SMELLED NEXT SO I THINK OF THIS OF THE IMAGE THE POPSOF MY MIND WE SHOULD EXPLAING TO BE WHAT YEU FARNS COPY IS A IN NEUROU SCIENCE IN EURANATOMY A THE CONNECTION TO A STRUCTURES CALLED AN AFFERENT WITH AN EH AND THE CONNECTIONS OUT FROM A STRUCTURE CALLE THAT YE FAR BUT AT THE WAY OF NAS EVEN MATTER IT'S JUST BASICALLY THE POINT HERE IS THAT IN OUR EXPERIENCE AND AR IN THE WAY THE BRAIN YOU BRAIN CONJURES AN EXPERIENCE OF HEY AND AND THAT EXPERIENCEIS THAT YOU FEEL SOMETHING FIRST YOU SEE SOMETHING YOU FEEL SOMETHING YOU ACT THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING WHAT'S HAPPENING IS YOUR BRAIN IS PREPARING THE ACTION FIRST AND THE FEELING WHAT AND YOUR EXPERIENCE COMES FROM THAT ACTION PREPARATION SO IT'S A COPY I'S LIKE LITERALLY YOU HAVE AXONS THAT ARE SENDING MOTOR SIGNALS DOWN THE THE YOU KNOW BRAIN STEM TO THE SPINAL CORD AND LITERAL COPIES OF THOSE AXONS LIKE THOSE AS ONS HAVE BRANCHES THAT COLATERALS BRANCHES THAT JUST SEND AXSONS OTHER PLACES THE SAME SIGNAL THAT IS BEING SENT TO YOUR SPINAL CORD TO MOVE STUFF IN YOUR BODY THAT SAME SIGNAL IS BEING SENT TO OTHER NURONS IN THE BRAIN AS PREDICTIONS OF THE SENSATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO HAPPEN IN A SECOND FROM NOW A MOMENT FROM NOW PUBLIC FASTFER THE SECOND BUT YOU KNOW IN COBLE MILL SECONDS IF YOU MOVE AND SO YES IT IS THE CASE THAT WHAT YOU FEEL IS LINKED TO WHAT YOU DO AND WHAT YOU DO IS LINK TO WHAT YOU FEEL BUT NOT IN THIS SIMPLE MECHANISTIC WAY THAT THAT NEUR SCIENTISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE BEEN USING FOR EVER YOU IT S NOT LIKE YOU ARE YOU ARE YOU YOU'RE PROBED BY A STIMULUS YOU YOU SEE SOMETHING YOU HEAR SOMETHING AND THEN YOU PROCESSED AND EVALUATED AND THEN YOUE REACT TO IT NO THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING UNDER THE HOOD IS THAT BASED ON HOW THINGS ARE RIGHT NOW YOUR BRAIN MAKES A GUESS OR SOME GUESSES AND THOSE GUESTSIS START AS MOTOR PLANS AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF THOSE MOTOR PLANS ARE PREDICTED SENSATIONS AND THEN OF COURSE CENSORY SIGNALS ARE COMING FROM THE CENSORY SURFACES AND THEY AND HERE'S THE REALLY HERE'S TO ME THE REALLY THE MOST MIND BOGGLING THING ABOUT THIS FOL EXPLANATION IF YOU'RE CENSORY NURONS IN YOUR CENSORE AREAS ARE ALREADY SO THEY'RE FIRING THAT THE THE THE ACTION POTENTIALS THE SPIKING HAS CHANGED BASE ON THESE PREPARED MOTOR MOVEMENTS THESE ARE CENSORY PREDICTIONS AND YOU KNOW WHEN I GIVE TALKSIN ON MY WEBSIDE TO HAVE SOME COOL EXAMPLES OF OF HOW THIS WORKS YOU CAN EXPERIENCE IT YOURSELF YOU YOU KNOW START TO EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW YOU HEAR THINGS THAT AREN'T THERE YOU YOU FEEL VIBRATIONS IN YOUR CHEST THAT AREN'T THERE BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN IS PREDICTING ITS PREDICTING THESE SENSATIONS SO LET'S SAY THE SENSATIONS COME TTHE SENSORY SIGNALS I SHOULD SAY LIME SO THE CENSORY SIGNALS FROM THE CENSORY SURFACES OF THE BODY MAKE IT TO THE BRAIN IF YOU HAVE IF YOUR NURONS ARE ALREADY FIRING IN A WAY TO ANTICIPATE THOSE SIGNALS THOSE SIGNALS JUST CONFIRM THE FIRING AND THEN THEY'RE DONE THEY DON'T MAKE IT ANY FURTHER INTO THE BRAIN SO WHEN YOU'RE PREDICTING WELL YOUR EXPERIENCEIS CONSTRUCTED COMPLETELY BY YOUR BRAIN THE SIGNALS FROM THE CENSORY SURFACES ARE THERE JUST TO CONFIRM OR TO CHANGE THE SIGNALS SO IF THERE'S THINGS YOU DIDN'T ANTICIPATE THEN THOSE A ERRORS OF PREDICTION THOSE AFE THE SIGNALS THAT ARE PROPAGATED AND BECOME COMPRESSED AND STUFF AND WE HAVE A SPECIAL NAME FOR THAT IN SCIENCE WE CALL IT LEARNING OU KNOW ANTICLARK IS A PHILOSOPHER WHO WRITES A LOT ABOUT PREDICTION PREDICTING BRAIN AND AND SO ON AND HE TALKS ABOUT NORMAL LA EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE AS BEING A CONTROLLED HALLUCINATION THAT'S TRUE YET I SUBSCRIBED TO THAT AM IT'S A FAIRLY ADAPTED AND MOST CIRCUMSTANCES CONTROLLED HALLUCINATION BUT BUT IT HAS ITS LIMITATIONS AND IT I MEAN WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AM IF I CAN BE A SOMEWHAT OF A SUMMARINEER ON YOUN TELL ME IF AT MY SUMMARY IS TO WORSE AM IS THAT FIRS AL THAT THE NERL SYSTEMS AND THE BRAIN LET'S JUS CALL THE NERVOUS SYSTEM CRETURING BOT BRAIN AND BODY ARE INCREDIBLY DYNAMIC THERE'S IT'S BUNCH OF IMPUTS THOSE IN PUTS GETS ARE INCREDIBLY ELABORATE THEY GET SUMMARIZED THE SUMMARY PREPARES THE BODY FOR A CERTAIN ACTION THAT'S A MOTOR COMMANDS PREMOTOR COMMANDS AND THEN  SOME ACTION MAY OR MAY NOT BE TAKEN BUT ALREADY AS SOON AS AN ACTION IS TAKEN OR NOT TAKEN THE WHOLE STATE OF THE NERAL SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT IT'S CHANGED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF JUST OF WHAT JUST HAPPEN OF COURSE WHEN PEOPLE HEAR THAT AND WHEN I HEAR THAT INDEED I I FEEL LIKE WOTS IT'S A TOSS SYSTEM TO STUDY BECAUSETHESE AR DYNAMICAL NERAL SYSTEMS AND AND WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO PUT PEOPLE IN FUNCTIONAL SCANNERS AND LOOK AT WHAT LIGHTS UP SO TO SPEAK WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ASK PEOPLE HOW THEY FEEL BASED ON QUESTIONAIRS BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT'S INCREDIBLY CRUDES SO THEN YOU GIVE THEM LIKER SCALES OF YU NOW RATE FROM ONE TO TEN HOW HAPPY OR SAD YOU ARE AND SEE YOUR ADDING SOME SOME DEPTH INTOMENTIONALITY TO BUT IT'S INCREDIBLY CRUDE IT'S NOTHING LIKE REAL EXPERIENCE AND IF SOMEBODY'S MORE VERBAL LESS VERBAL MAYBE THEY SOMEMATICIZE MORE OR LESS MEAN I BUT  EXAMPLE COMES TO MIND IT OOCCASIONALLY YOU L ARN FROM SOCIAL MEDIA WHICH OFTEN I LEARN FROM SOCIAMEDIAN SOME ONE ONCE SAID I DON'T THINK IN THOUGHTS I THINK IN FEELS AND I THOUGHT I GET GREATLY YOU'RE PROBABLY ALSO FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND I SAID WAIT ANDREW STOPPING SO JUDGEMENTAL WHAT DO YOU MEAN AND I ASKE THEY SAID I EXPERIENCE EMOTIONS IN THEIR MIND FIRST AS A AS A BODILY STATE THEN THE LABEL COMES MUCH LATER THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS FOR ME IT FEELS FAIRLY MORE INTEGRATED BRAIN AND BODY FOR ME BUT OTHER PEOPLE STARTED CHIMING AND NO I THINK OF EMOTION I EXPERIENCE EMOTIONS CLEARLY AS A VERBAL LABEL IT'S ALL IN THEY ARE HEAD AND SO YOU START TO REALIZE THAT WE MIGHT ALL BEING CODING THE WORLD SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY OR VERY DIFFERENTLY AND IT'S CHANGING IN TIME SO THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES YOU KNOW HOW WHAT ARE THE ANCHOR POINTS IN TERMS OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF EMOTIONS THAT WE CAN WORK WIRTH AND AND AND THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS COME TO MINE I'M NEITHER YOU NOR IR CLINITIONS AS FAR AS I KNOW I'M CERTAINLY NOT I MET LAUALY TRAIN TO THE CLENNES OH THERE YOU GO I'M RIGHT AGAIN AT I HAM AN  EE I I HAVEN'T RI HAVEN'T PRACTICED IN LIKE REALLY GASILYINS O VEARAT WILL YOU HA YOUR WERE YOUR MORE THAN QUALIFYD TO ANSWER THE QUESTION I AM ABOUT TO ASK WHICH IS TO ME THERE IS A GREAT CONFLICT OF INFORMATION IN THE PSYCHOLOGY PSYCHIATRY AND LESS JUST CALL IT WELLNESS AND MENTAL HEALTH SPACE WHICH IS WHEN WE ARE FEELING LOUSY LIKE NOT GOOD LET'S PUT VAILANCE ON IT JUST LOUSY I DON'T WANT IN THE STATE THAT WE WERE HAVING AN EMOTION THAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE THERE'S AN ENTIRE CATEGORY OF INFORMATION THAT SAYS YOU NEED TO FEEL YOUR FEELINGS OUN TO FEELIOUR FEELINGS YOU NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY'RE THERE YOU NEED TO GO IN TO THE FEELING MAYBE EVEN FULL CATHARSIS YOU NEED TO AMPLIFY THE FEELINGS UNTIL THEY QUENQUI LEAVE YOUR BODY AFTER ALL STEVE JOBS WAS INTO SCREAM THERAPY AND THE HELPED HIM MX PUNGES ANGER WHO KNOWS YOU GET THESE EXAMPLES HE'S PRY THE WORST EXAMPLE CAUSE IT SEMED LIKE HE WAS ANGRY A LOT FROM WHAT I RE BUT THEN THERE'S ANOTHER CATEGORY OF THOUGHT WHICH IS NO YOU NEED TO USE YOUR ABILITY TO TOP DOWN CONTROL IN HIBITION OF THE QUARTEKS ON LOWER STRUCTURES AGAIN IM DELIBERATELY USING CRUDE LANGUAGE HERE TO SAY WAIT YOU KNOW THIS IS AN EMOTION EMOTIONS PASS THIS IS NOT REAL THIS IS JUST A LIMITED SET OF A HIGH DIMENTIONALITY STUFF THAT'S BEEN SUMMARISED AND YOU KNOW IT I DON'T NEED TO FEEL THIS WAY I CAN MAKE MYSELF FEEL DIFFERENTLY MAYBE I'LL GO FOR A RUN IN FACT I ALWAYS FEEL BETTER AFTER I GO FOR A RUN SO EVEN THIS QUESTION AS SIMPLE AS SHOULD WE FEEL OR OUR FEELINGS OR SHOULD WE NOT FEEL OUR FEELINGS AND OF COURSE YOU WOULD HOPE THAT THIS WOULD BE ANSWERED APPROPRIATELY SUCH THAT PEOPLE DON'T GO HARM OTHER PEOPLE ARE THEMSELVES BUT BUT ASSUMING THAT THE'RENOT CAN HARM OTHER PEOPLE O THEMSELVES VERBALLY OR PHYSICALLY THEN YOU REALLY GET YOURSELF INTO A BIT OF A PICKLE LIKE WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT TO DO WITH EMOTIONS HOURS IT WER OTHER PEOPLES BECAUSE CLEARLY WE DON'T UNDERSTAND EMOTIONS PERSAY SO I WOULD SAY I'M GOING TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AND THEN I WANT A U O PICKET THE WORE THE I WANT A PICKET AND ASSUMPTION BECAUSE IT IT'S COME UP ACTUALY A COUPLE OF TIMES AND THERE'S SOMETHING SUPERIMPORTANT IN YOUR DESCRIPTIONS THAT I JUST WANT TO PULL OUT FOR FOR THE LISTENERS ISTHING IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND YOU'RE DOING IT VERY NATURALLY BUT I THINK SOME PEOPLE IT WOULD BEIT JUST BEARS COMMENTING ON SO LET ME JUST DEEL WHAT THE QUESTION IV SHOULD WE FEEL OUR FEELINGS OR USE OUR WORDS WE SAY TO LITTLE KINS USE YOUR WORDS LIKE DON'T THROW A TAN TROM RIGHT BUT THEN THERE IS ALSO THIS OTHER FEELING WITH ALL JUST FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT TO FEEL AND YOU DON'T WANT TO GET HAV IT BE PENT UP AND AN REVEALS YOUR BODY AND LIKE IK GAAT A PILLOW YO HAVING THER SCREAM THEREI BE BITE THE PILLOW SCREAM THE PLOW TERRE THE PILLAR  AND THERES YOU CAN PAY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR WE OUT OF DOING THIS YESAND I'LL TELL YOU N T FEEL BETTER AGAAND SO THE ANSWER THERE IS IT'S THE WRONG QUESTION LIKE FLEXIBILITY IS IMPORTANT FOR EVERYTHING ALWAYS RIGHT SO IM FIRST OF ALL YOU DON'T HAVE YOU DO'T HAVE EMOTIONS IN YOUR BODY YOUR BODY DOESN'T KEEP THE SCORE YOU KNOW YO GREAT BOOK TITLE BECAUSE IT SUPERCATCHY YOT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO I THINK THE IMPORTANT WORK OF VENDRICO I THINK IT OVERSIMPLIFIED AND LET PEOPLE TO BELIEVE THAT THEIR BACKPAIN WAS TRAMA AND THAT ALL TRAMA IS SOMATICIZE AND IT'S NOT NO IT'S NOT BUT I I WOULD GO FURTHER AND SAY LIKE FIRST OF ALL YOUR BODY DOEST KEEP THE SCORE YOUR BRAIN KEEPS THE SCORE YOUR BODY IS THE SCORE CART THAT'S SUPERIMPORTANT AND HE HAS DONE REALLY IMPORTANT WORK BUT HIS EXPLANATIONS FOR WHY THINGS WORK IT SCIENTIFICALLY INCORRECT IT JUST IS BECAUSE WE DON'T FEEL THINGS IN OUR BODIES WE EVERYTHING WE FEEL WE FEEL IN OUR BRAINS WE DON'T SEE IN OUR EYES WE SEE IN OUR BRAINS OF COURSE WE NEED OUR EYES BUT WE DON'T SEE IN OUR EYES JUST LIKE IF YOU YOU KNOW PINCH YOUR YOUR HAND WITH YOU KNOW TAKE SKIN AND PINCHED BETWEEN YOU KNOW TO TO FINGERS THE SKIN YOU DON'T FEEL THAT ACTUALLY IN YOUR HAND YOU FEEL IT IN YOUR BRAIN THAT'S THE MAGIC OF THE BRAIN IN A SENSE SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS IT EM I IT DEPENDS ON THE SITUATION AND WHAT YOUR GOAL IS IM SOMETIMES IT IS USEFUL TO USE YOUR WORDS AND SOMETIMES IT IS USEFUL TO GO FOR A RUN IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHAT YOUR GOAL IS WLL BOTH THE THAT CASES YERE YOURE A THAT YOU GAVE BOTH US EXAMPLE SCUSE ME YER  IT'S A WAY OF SHIFTING OFF THE EMOTION I GUESS WHAT I MASK IS WELL SOME THOME YOU DON'T WANT TO SHIFT OFF THE EMOTION SOMETIMES THE MOTE SOMETIMES THE WISEST THING TO DO IS LIVE IN THE EMOTION THAT IS YOU NO SOMETIMES A DISCOMFORT SOMETIMES WHEN SOMETHING FEELS BAD IT DOESN'T MEAN SOMETHING IS WRONG IT JUST MIGHT MEAN THAT YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING HARD ELL EARLIER I HANBLE WHEN YOUR TIK ABOUT THE THE BROAD CATEGRISATION MOTIONS I I WROTE DOWN YOUR SIMPLE AS GOOD WHEN IT FEELS GOOD YOUL I HAD JUST FEEL REALLY GIRAT BUT THEN ON THINGS FEEL LOUSY WELL THAT'S WHERE YOU WANTS COULD BE BENEFICIYET ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE WERE BECAUSE EMOTIONS ARE RECIPES FOR ACTION WHEN YOU GO FROM VEEL IT FEELING BAD TO FEELING ANGERARY OR SAD IT'S A RECIPE FOR ACTION AND I WOULD ALSO SAY AND THIS JUST THIS IS AN ANALOGY BUT I I SORT OF I STAND BY IT I'M YOU KNOW I WHEN I WAS AM I HAD MAJOR BAXERGERY COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT CHRONIC PAIN IT'S NOT MY AREA OF STUDY BUT I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT IT CAUSE I'E IE AUNT REANALYZED O SOME DATA SETS AND I'VE READ A LOT SOM NOT AN EXPERT BUT YOU KNOW I HAVE IDEAS AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF WELL I JUST T IDA ONE A END UP WITH CHRONIC BACK PAIN SO WHAT I DID WAS I MADE SRE AFTER I GOT THROUGH THE FIRST COUPLE OF WEEKS WHERE I REALLY NEEDED OXY COAT ON SO THAT I COULD WALK YOU KNOWI WAS UP IN WALKING THE SAME DAY I HAD SURGERY IF YOU COULD CALL IT WALKING IS SORTOF A UPHAMISM FORLIC HOBBLING AROUND ON A WITH A WALKER BUT I'M I MADE SURE THAT I FELT THE PAIN THAT IS I DOSET MYSELF WITH DISCOMFORT QUITE DELIBERATELY BECAUSE I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I II'M SORRY FOR USING YOU KNOW CARTESIAN LANGUAGE I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO SAY THIS I I WANTED MY BRAIN TO BE TAKING IN THE PREDICTION AIR I WANTED MY BRAIN TO TO FEEL THE TO O I WANTED TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON THE CHANGING DISYOU KNOW THE THE CHANGING DISCOMFORT OVER TIME BECAUSE IT MEANT THAT MY BODY WAS HEELING AS THE DISCOMFORT GOT LESS BUT MY BRAIN WOULD NEVER FEEL THAT DISCOMFORT CHANGING IF I A TOOK PAIN KILLER AND BECAUSE THE PREDICTION ERROR THE THINGS THAT THE BRAIN DOESN'T PREDICT  OUR TEACHING SIGNALS AND I THINK IT'S TRUE ALSO IN YOUR LIFE LIKE SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO FEEL IT BECAUSE YOU YOU WANT TO FEEL THE DISCOMFORT BECAUSE IT'S INSTRUCTIVE ABOUT SOMETHING AND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT AND THAT'S MAYBE THAT'S NOT REALLY IN ANSWER BUT THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN FIGURE THAT OUT FOR YOURSELF IS TO DO IT SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE ALWAYS GETTING RID OF DISCOMFORT YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IT'S USEFUL AND IT IS USEFUL SOMETIMES BUT NOW I WANT TO GET TO THIS POINT THAT I WAS MAKING BEFORE LIKE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FEELING AND EMOTION INTERCHANED LIKE THEY'RE INTERCHANGEABLE AND THEY'RE NOT RIGHT SO HERE'S HOW I WOULD SAY IT YOUR BRAIN IS ALWAYS REGULATING YOUR BODY TWENTY FOUR SEVEN AND YOUR BODY IS ALWAYS SENDING SENSORY SIGNALS BACK TO THE BRAIN ABOUT THE SENSORY STATE OF THE BODY AND OUR NERVOUS SYSTEMS AREN'T WIRED FOR US TO EXPERIENCE THOSE CENSORY CHANGES THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE BODY IN ANY DEGREE OF DETAIL WE'RE JUST NOT AND IT'S A GOOD THING THAKE RIGHT NOW AS WE TALK HERE OUR HEARTS ARE BEATING AND ARE YOU KNOW PANCREOUS IS SQUISHING STUFF OUT YOU KNOW LIN LIVER IS YOU KNOW FILTERING AND LIKE BRYOU KNOW OXAGIN CONCENTRAGIONS ORE CHANGING LIKE ALL THERE'S A WHOLE DRAMA GOING ON INSIDE EACH OF US AND OUR LISTENERS AND WE'RE LARGELY NOT AWARE AND I HOPE OUR LISTENERS AREN'T AWARE BECAUSE IF THEY WERE THEY WOULD NOT BE LISTENING TO ANYTHING WE WERE SAYING THEY'D BE COMPLETELY YOU KNOW IN IN RAPTURED OR WERE IN DISCOMFORT AT WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE THEM INSTEAD THE BRAIN CREATES A LOW DIMENSIONABLE SUMMARY THIS GROSS KIND OF LIKE BAROMETER WHICH IS FEELING AFFECTIVE FEELING WE CALL IT OR YOU COULD CALL IT MOOD BUT SCIENTIST C LL IT AFFECT WITH AN EG FEELING PLEASANT FEELING UNPLEASANT FEELING WORKED AP FEELING CALM FEELING COMFORTABLE FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE IT'S KIND OF A GENERAL BAROMETER OF THE STATE OF THE BODY AND IT'S NOT EMOTION THAT THOSE FEELINGS THOSE FEATURES OF FEELING ARE FEATURES OF CONSCIOUSNESS BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN IS ALWAYS REGULATING YOUR BODY YOUR BODY'S ALWAYS SENDING SIGNALS BACK TO THE BRAIN THE BRAIN IS ALWAYS REPRESENTING THEM IN THIS LOW DIMENSIONAL WAY WHETHER YOUR PAYING ATTENTION OR NOT LIKE WHETHER THE BRAIN IS FOCUSING IT'S YOU KNOW APPLYING ATTENTION TO THOSE NUR ONS OR NOT THET THOSE SIGNALS ARE THERE AND EVEN WHEN WE'RE NOT EMOTIONAL YOU KNOW LIKE IF YOU'RE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AND SOMEBODY CUTS YOU OFF AND YOU THINK WHAT AN ASSFHUL THE ASSPULNESS OF THAT PERSON THAT INTENSITY OF THAT NEGATIVE AFFECT IT'S YOU EXPERIENCE IT AS A PROPERTY OF THAT PERSON BUT REALLY IT'S COMING FROM YOU IT'S IT'S NOT A PROPERTY OF THAT PERSON IT'S THAT'S A FEATURE OF YOUR EXPERIENCE IN THAT MOMENT AND AFFECT IS ALWAYS THERE SOMETIMES IT'S IN THE FOREGROUND SOMETIMES IS IN THE BACKGROUND BUT IT'S ALWAYS THERE AND IT'S A SUMMARY OF PHYSICAL THINGS WHICH IS WHY IT HELPS TO IF YOU TAKE IBE PROPHIN OR TILONAL IT WILL REDUE IT MEAN STUDY SHOW IT REDUCES NEGATIVE FEELING IF YOU GO FOR A RUN IF YOU GO FOR A WALK IF YOU SHIFT YOUR ATTENTION TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD THAND THE FEATURES THAT OF EXPERIENCE THAT ORE DERIVED FROM THE INSIDE WORLD DIMINISH THAT'S WHY GOING FOR A RUN HELPS ARE GOING FOR A WALK HELPS OR YOU KNOW GETTING SLEEP HELPS RIGHT THESE ARE ALL THINGS WHERE YOUR CHANGING THE STATE OF YOUR BODY AND SO THE SENSORY STATE OF YOUR BODY'S CHANGING AN SO YOU'RE AFFECT CHANGES BUT EMOTIONS ARE THE STORY THAT THE BRAIN TELS ABOUT WHAT C AUS THE CENSORY SIGNALS THAT AFFECT DERIVES FROM SO WHAT CAUSE THOSE CHANGES WHAT AE I NEED TO DO ABOUT THOSE CHANGES THAT'S THAT'S THAT GET IT'S A MUCH BIGGER EVENT THAN JUST THESE FEATURES OF EXPERIENCE WHICH ARE ALL FEATURES OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH ARE ALWAYS THERE THEY'RE ALWAYS THERE AND IN FACT IN OUR CULTURE WE WE PATHOLOGIZED PEOPLE WHEN THEY JUST EXPERIENCE THEIR BODIES AS PHYSICAL SENSATIONS AND NOT IS EMOTIONS LIKE WE SAY OTHAT PERSON SO MUCH O SOMATISIZING OR SOMATIZING THEY'RE NOT THEY SHOULD THERE REALLY THERE THEY SHOULD BE EXPERIENCE BING IN MOTION BUT REALLY THERE YOEXPERIENCING A STOMACH ACHE AND THAT'S BAD BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY A JUDGMENT CALL THAT IS PROBABLY SOMETIMES WRONG SOMETIMES IT'S PROBABLY BETTER TO EXPERIENCE A STOMACH ACHE SOMETIMES IT'S MORE PRODUCTIVE PART OF BEING EMOTIONLY INTELLIGENT AS KNOWING WHEN NOT TO CONSTRUCT AN EMOTION YOU KNOW LIKE RIGHT BEFORE THE COVID PANDEMIC WAS ANNOUNCED OFFICIALLY I WAS IN NEW ZEALAND GIVING TALKS AND MY DAUGHTER WHO WAS IT WO WAS IN COLLEGE AT THAT TIME WAS FLYING I LITERALLY LIKE  I THINK LESS THAN A WEEK BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WAS ANNOUNCED SHE GOT ON A PLAN AND SHE FLEWTA NEW ZEALAND TO MET ME BECAUSE IT WAS SPRING BREAK AND I ALWAYS WOULD BRING HER WITH ME ON SPRING BREAK AND IN THAT AND I REMEMBER REALLY VIVIDLY I WAS IN NEW ZEALAND THERE WAS ONLY ONE CASE ONE CASE OF COVID IN NEW ZEALAND AT THAT POINT AND I I GOT ON THE PHONE TO MY HUSBAND AND I SAY I'M EXPERIENCING A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF AROUSAL AND IT'S VERY VERY UNPLEASANT NOW MY HUSBAND KNOWS ME VERY WELL AND HE SAID YET THERE IS A LOT F UNCERTAINTY AND I SAID I KNOW NOW HE DIDN'T SAY TO ME WHELL YOU'RE ANXIOUS AND YOU JUST DON'T REALLY KNOW IT I CAUSE I WASN'T ANXIOUS I WAS FEELING UNCERTAIN AND AS YOU KNOW OR MAYBE PEOPLE AR NOW THAT WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF AROUSAL BECAUSE THE BRAIN IS ATTEMPTING TO LEARN AND THE NERMODULATORS THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR LEARNING NEW THINGS HAPPENED ALSO CAUSE A A SUBJECTIVE SENSE OF AROUSAL AND SOME THEY ACTUALLY ALSO MODULATE YOUR AUDONOMIGNERVOUS SYSTEMS TO YOUR HEART CAN BE FAST FROM REVEREND OUR GO TO EXPLANATION FOR WHAT THAT IS IS TO EXPERIENCE THAT AROUSAL AS ANXIETY BUT I WAS UNCERTAIN AND REMEMBER THAT HOW YOUR BRAIN THE STORY IT'S TELLING ITSELF THE CATEGORY IT'S MAKING IS A PLAN FOR ACTION WHAT DOE YOU DO IN ANXIETY IN FEAR YOU FREEZE OR YOU RUN AWAY WHAT DO YOU DOIN UNCERTAINTY YOU FORAGE FOR INFORMATION YOU TOLERATE THE DISCOMFORT AND YOU FORAGE FOR INFORMATION WHICH IS WHAT I WAS DOING WHEN I CALLED AND SAID WHAT SHOULD WE DO SHOULD I MEET HER THE AIRPORTANT TURN ROUND COME BACK OR SHOULD WE HAVE A VACATION LIKE I DON'T REALLY KNOW AM AND YOU KNOW WHAT I ENDED UP DOING WAS FORAGING FOR INFORMATION OR ANOTHER COUPLE DAYS AND THEN MADE A SPLIT SECOND DECISION IN THE EIR WHEN WE WERE FLYING FROM ONE ISLAND TO THE OTHER AND WHI JUST RERUTED US AND WE WENT HOME AND THEN THE BORDERS CLOSED LIKE TWO DAYS LATER YOU KNOW BUT MY POINT IS THAT IT THIS IS NOT JUST YOU KNOW A PSYCHOLOGICAL MUMBO JUMBO YOU CON TRAIN YOURSELF TO EXPERIENCE YOUR HEART POUNDING IN YOUR CHEST AS DETERMINATION BUT WHEN MY DAUGHTER THISIS ALL IN HOW MOTIONS ARE MADE THESE EXAMPLES BUT THEY'RE TRUE MEAN MY DAUGHTER JUST US THIS BOOK I ROD A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD SHE WAS TE STING FOR A BLACKBELT IN CARATI SHE WAS FIVE FEET ALL NOT EVEN AND SHE WAS TESTING AGAINST THESE LIKE MASSIVELY LARGE ADOLESSEN BOYS THEY WHO WERE LIKE A FOOT TALLER THAN HER AND HER SENSA WHO WAS A TEMPTICALLY BLACKBELL DIDN'T SAY TO HER DON'T BE AFERAD HE SAID GET YOUR BUTTERFLIES FLYING IN FORMATION AND I WAS LIKE IN RAPTURE ONLY ANMY GON THIS KINDS TONALLY BRILLIANT THAT IS THE BEST YOU KNOW MEANING TO GIVE TO AROUSAL THAT CHANGES THE MEANING OF IT WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU CREATE AN EMOTION IS YOUR GIVING MEANING TO THOSE AFFECTIVE FEELINGS AND YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL THEN YOU MIGHT THINK IN HOW YOU DO THAT YOU CAN DO IT BY CHANGING THE PHYSICAL STATE THAT GIVES RISE TO THOSE FEELINGS BUT YOU CAN ALSO CHANGE IT BY LEARNING MORE HOW TO MAKE MORE CATEGORIES AND HOW TO MAKE THEM MORE FLUIDLY AM SO THAT YOU DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND THE IT'S NOT THE THINGS WILL NECESSARILY FEEL ANY MORE UNPLEASANT OR ANY LESS OR ARE ANY MORE PLEASANT IT'S THAT THE FEELING BECOMES A SOURCE OF WISDOM IT'S A CUE TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT TIS A CASE AWHERE I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT A KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW EMOTIONS AND AFFECT AND STATES OF THE BRAIN AND BODY WORK WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE BEAUTIFULLY DESCRIBING FOR PEOPLE TO DAY IS EXTREMELY USEFUL IN AN OF ITSELF AND I THINK IT OM AND I IT'S A FRANKLY T'SI IT'S A REFRESHING AND WELCOME DEPARTURE FROM A LOT OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE NORMALLY HAVE ON THIS PART CAST WHERE YOUKNW WE TALK LAE LU ABOUT PROTOCALS WE TIKE ABOUT TOOLS I THINKS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO WAYS THEY CAN IMPLEMENT THE KNOWLEDGE AND HER THIS IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THOSE CASES AS WELL BUT UEM IT'S A BEAUTIFUL ONE AND A VERY UM IMPORTANT ONE WHERE THE KNOWLEDGE ITSELF JUST THE KNOWLEDGE OF ADDITIONAL WORDS FOR DIFFERENT STATES I LOVE THE EXAMPLE OF BUTTER PUTTING BUTTERFLIES INTO FORMATION BECAUSE IT IT INHERENT TO THAT IS THAT YOU'RE NOT TRY TO GET RID OF THE BUTTERFLIESE QUITE THE OPPOSITE UM YOU'RE DEPLORING THEM IN CERTAIN WAYS AND THE'S AN ACTION STEP AND A PSYCHOLOGICAL STEP THERE OF COURSE THAT'S REQUIRED BUT THAT IT ISN'T A IN A FEW MORNING SUNLIGHT FOR AN AVERAGE OF TEN MINUTES TO SET YOUR CIRCATIAN RHYTHM WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I SAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN I'LL GOING TO THE GRAVE SAYING THAT THE PUT PUT A WINDOW OVER MY GRAVES AS SOME LI CAN GET IN AT THIS POINT BY WHICH SHULD BE FINE WITH ME BUT IN ANY CASE EM KNOWLEDGE IS POWER SOMETHING THAT WE HEAR BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS TRUE OFTEN IT'S KNOWLEDGE IS POWER BUT YOU NEED TO DO EX WHYANZE IN A CERTAIN ORDER BUT HEAR WHAT YOU'VE PROVIDED AND YOU YOU'RE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE IS KNOWLEDGE THAT PEOPLE CAN USE THAT REAL ESTATE WITHIN THEIR BRAIN I'M DELIBERATELY NOT GIVING IT A NAME A BECAUSE IT'S IT'S DISTRIBUTED REAL ESTATE THAT ALLOWS THEM TO TAKE AN UNPLEASANT FEELING AND WORK WITH IT UM THAT IT HAS MORE DIMENSIONALITY THAN WE PROBABLY REALIZE UM THAT'S BECOMING CLEAR TO ME THAT RARELY IF EVER IS THERE LESS DIMENTIONALITY UM YOU CAN ALWAYS GIVE IT MORE DIMENTIONALITY BY JUST SHIFTING YOUR ATTENTION AND YOU CAN PRACTISE THIS REALLY SO YOU KNOW LIKE THERE'S THE STORY THAT I TELL ABOUT WHEN I THE BRIEF A MOMENT WHEN I TRYD TO LEARN HOW TO PAINT YOU KNOW AND SO A THERE'S AN OBJECT LIKE A CUP AND YOU HAVE THIS THREE DIMENTIONAL OBJECT AND YOU WANT A RANDER IT ON A TOO DIMENSIONAL CANVASS SO YOU COULD JUST TRY TO DRAW THE CUP AND THEN WHAT YOU GET IS A PRETTY SHIDDY LOOKING YOU KNOW CUP EM BAT WHAT WHAT A REALIST PAI TER WILL TEACH YOU TO DO IS TO TAKE THE CUP AND TO BREAK IT APART INTO PIECES OF LIGHT AND THEN WHAT YOU TRY TO PAINT OR THE PIECES OF LIGHT TO YOU'R TRANSFERING YOUR FIRST WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE TAKING THIS VERY LOW DIMENSIONAL COARSE OBJECT CALLED A CUP IN YOUR BREAKING IT INTO TINY LITTLE PIECES OF LIGHT IS WHAT THE VISUAL SYSTEM ITIS WHAT THE VISUAL SYSTEM DOES AND SO WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOUR CATAGRIZING IT DIFFERENTLY IN ORDER TO EMPHASIZE THE FEATURES THAT ARE MORE HIGH DIMENSIONAL THAT ARE IN THERE RIGHT THERE IN THERE IN IN THE BRAIN BUT YOU CAN BUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING ESSENTIALLY IS YOUR YOUR HAVING THE BRAIN YOUR BRAIN IS APPLYING ATTENTION TO BASICALLY A FOCUS MORE ON THOSE DETAILS AND THEN YOU TRANSFER THE DETAILS ON TO THE TWO DIMENSIONAL CANVASS AND WHAT YOU GET IS A PRETTY DECENT LOOKING THREE DIMENSIONAL CUP ON A TW DIMENIONAL CANVASS UNLAT UNLESS YOU'RE ME AND TAND THEN IT STILL LOOK SHIDDY WIE NOW AND SO MAYBE ALL I'LL TAKE UP AGAIN SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE BUT MY POINT IS THAT YOU CAN DO THAT WITH YOUR OWN SENSORY CONDITION OF YOUR BODY IN EMOTION YOU CAN DELIBERATELY FOCUS ON WHAT YOUR HEART IS DOING TO THE CHEERED THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY THAT YOU CAN SENSE IT RIGHT OR YOU CAN DELIBERATELY FOCUSS ON YOUR BREATHING OR YOU CAN DELIBERATELY FOCUS ONEWHAT YOUR MUSCLES OR HOW HOW TENSE THEY FEEL YOU CAN YOU CAN CHANGE THE DIMENSIONALITY OF YOUR EXPERIENCE BY THE SHIFTING OF YOUR ATTENTION LO IT END OUT FORGIVE ME FOR GIVEING ANOTHER EXAMPLE BY THING ITS ONE THAT WILL RESINATE WITH BOTH OF US IN HOPEFULLY WITH OUR LISS NURSES WELL WHICH IS  THE GREAT OLVERSACS NOUROLOGIST AN AUTHOR AM TALKED ABOUT AND RODE ABOUT YOU'R YOU'D WORK WITH THESE PATIENTS THAT WERE EITHER HAD LOCKED IN CINDRUM OR SEVERE AUTISM OR SEVERE TERETS IR PARKINSONS AND YOUR MOST PEOPLE WOULD EVEN CLINITIONS WHO SPECIALIZE IN THOSE AREAS WOULD LOOK AT THOSE PEOPLE N SAY THAT THEIR LIVING IN A DIMINISHED WORLD IT'S IT'S THEIR LAK CAPACITIES THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE AND UM AND IT'S ALL ABOUT THE ATHE ABSENCE OF CERTAIN ABILITIES AND AND THEN WHAT HE DID EVENTUALLY WAS INCREDIBLE HE LOVED ANIMALS SO HE WOULD SPEND TIME THINKING ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE FOR INSTANCE TO BE A BAT HANGING IN THE CORNER OF A ROOM AND EXPERIENCE THE ROOM NOT THROUGH VISION BUT MAINLY THROUGH ECOLOCATION AND HE WOULD PEND A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT THAT HE ALSO DID A LOT OF DRUGS AT ONE POINT IS FEREAND STOPPED NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE VERY DESTRUCTIVE DRUGS NOT JUST PSYCHODELICS BUT ALSO MET THEM PHETAMINES O YES HE HAS THAT BUT HE EVENTUALLY CHANGED HIS PRACTICE TO TRYING TO EXPERIENCE HUMAN EMOTION BUT FIRST THINK ABOUT ANIMAL CENSORY EXPERIENCE AND HE WOULD DO THAT FOR LOTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF ANIMALS OCTAPUSS AND BATS AND ALL THESE ERETHINGS AND THEN IT ALLOWED HIM IN HIS WORDS IT ALLOWED HIM TO THAN INTERACT WITH PATIENCE IN A WAY WHERE HE COULD FEEL MAYBE EVEN EMPATHIZE A LITTLE BIT WITH HOW THEY EXPERIENCED LIFE AND THEN HE WOULD WRITE BOOKS ABOUT IT IN A WAY AND HERE ON BORROWING SOME ONE ELSE'S WORDS THAT STORIED THESE PEOPLE INTO ALMOST GREATER LARGER THAN LIFE CHARACTERS AND NOW OF COURST HE WASN'T TRYING TO DETRACT FROM THEIR SUFFERING BUT HE WAS TRYING TO GIVE PEOPLE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THAT SUFFERING WAS LIKE THROUGH THEIR ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND HE DID IN MY OPINION AND THE OPINION MENAR OTHER PEOPLE A MASTERFUL JOB NOT DOING THAT  BUT IT CAME THROUGH MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOUR OUR TEACHER SAID YOU KNOWT PAY ATTENTION TO THE WAY THE THAT THE CHANGES IN LIGHT ACROSS THETHAT THE OBJECT AS SUPPOSE TO TRYING TO DROP DRAW THE OBJECT THEMSELVES THAT WHEN WE SO THAT THAT THE TAKE AWAY HERE THAT I I THINK WERE ARRIVING AT IS THAT THAT YOU'VE PROVIDED IS THAT IF WE TAKE A IF WE ADD TO MENTIONALITY TO OUR DESCRIPTION OF OR EXPERIENCE OF THE CENSORY IMPUTS AND THERE'S ALL TON OF IT TO REACH TO AND WE MAY EVEN COME UP WITH SOME NEW INTERNAL LABELS OR LANGUAGH BASE LABELS THAT WE CAN EXPERIENCE THE WORLD AND MUCH RICHER AND MUCH MORE ADAPTED FORIT ABSOLUTELY AND I I LOVE I LOVE YOUR STORIES AND I LOVE THIS STORY IN PARTICULAR ABOUT OLIVER SAX BECAUSE A IT RESINATES WITH MY EXPERIENCE WHEN I WAS READING EM ED YONG'S NEW BOOK OH EM IT FIRST HE WROTE AH WE CONTAIN MULTITUDES WHICH YOU O THINK ONE OF POLITSER AND THEN UM AH WHAT IS THE RECENT WAY WITH TH ANIMALOF IMMENSE WER AN IMMENSE WORLD AND WHAT I WHAT I WAS THINKING WAS YOU KNOW IT'S A FIRST OF ALL IT'S A MASTERFUL MASTERFUL MASTERFUL BOOK I WISH I HAD WRITTEN THAT BOOK II WROTE HIM A FAN LETTER ELSE LI M BOOK HERE MA AM BUT BECAUSE HE HELPS YOU EXEXPERIENCE SO WHAT WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS THIS THAT THERE ARE ALL THESE ANIMALS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT SENSORY SURFACES THAN WE DO AND THEY CAN DETECT SIGNALS IN THE WORLD THAT ARE THAT WE THAT ARE NOT RELEVANT TO US BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE SENSORY SERFACES FOR THEM AND IT REMINDS YOU FIRST OF ALL THAT WHAT YOU EXPERIENCE AS REALITY IS REALLY NOT IN THE WORLD ALONE AND IT'S NOT IN YOUR HEAD ALONE IT IS IN THE TRANSACTION BETWEEN THE TWO YOU KNOW YOU'RE THE NURONS IN YOUR BRAIN AND IN YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM ARE ALSO PART OF THE REALITY AND SO REALITY IS THE TRANSACTION RALIALITY ARE ARE THE FEATURES THAT ARE THE TRANSACTION BETWEEN SIGNALS IN THE WORLD AND SIGNALS IN YOUR BRAIN AND THE PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT SOME OTHER ANIMALS EXPERIENCE THAT WE WILL NEVER EXPERIENCE THEY'RE NOT REALLY PART OF OUR REALITY BECAUSE THEY DON'T INTERACT WITH ANY OF THE ANYTHING THAT WE HAVE BUT FOR THOSE ANIMALS IT'S PART OF THEIR NICIITS PART OF THEIR YOU KNOW NICIUS JUST THE WORD FOR THE PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT MATTER TO YOU BASICALLY AND I WAS THINKING THAT IF PEOPLE READ THIS BOOK AND U KNOW MAYBE IT WILL HELP THEM HAVE EMPATHY FOR OTHER PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE MINDE LIKE THEIRS AND WHO DON'T EXPERIENCE THE WORLD IN THE WAY THAT THEY DO YOUR DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WOUT AM OLIVER SACT HIS WOUL HIS THEM HIS ACTIONS WERE IN HIS GALD IT DID OCCUR TO ME THAT THIS BOOK BY A YONG WOULD BE A GREAT TOO ALL FOR HELPING PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WAY THAT THEY EXPERIENCE THE WORLD IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT THEN HOW OTHER PEOPLE EXPERIENCE THE WORLD AND EVEN A LITTLE BIT OF A WINDOW ON THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING SO I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU MORE ABOUT THIS WORD AFFECT AND THEN I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS HOW THINGS THAT WE DO OR DON'T DO MIG BE USEFUL FOR PUTTING US IN BROAD CATEGORIES OF AFFECT SO THAT WE MIGHT EXPERIENCE PARTICULAR A RAYS OF EMOTIONS A SO THIS IS MY ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND AFFECT IN AN EFFORT TO THINK ABOUT SOME ACTIONABLE ITEMS I LOVE THE WORD AFFECT THE WAY YOU DESCRIBED IT AS RE SETTING UP A BUT TENSHAL AR A SERIES OF POTENTIALITIES FOR DIFFERENT EMOTIONS TO OCCUR I MAKE IT A POINT TO GET SUNLIGHT IN MY EYES IN THE MORNING TO TRY AND WAKE UP MY BURING AND BODY BECAUSE INDEED IT DOES THAT A OT BROADLY SPEAKING I MAKE AN EFFORT TO GET GOOD SLEEP AT NIGHT BECAUSE THAT MAKES EVERYTHING BETTER THEN WHEN I'M NOT SLEEPING WELL OR ENOUGH IT MAKES EVERYTHING WORSE THIS IS NON CLINICAL NON NUAUNT'S LANGUAGE BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY HEAR AFFECT AND THEY THINK ABOUT THE EXAMPLES I JUST GAVE NOT OF UNDERSTAND LIKE YALLIC WHEN A KID IS TIRED T LE TEM KID TO GET CRANKY WHEN WORSE SLEEP DEFRIVE YO GET CRANKY INDEED THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I'M SLEEP DEPRIVED AND LITTLE THINGS GREAT ON ME THEY'D LIKE A SPLINTER JUST FEELS S OPER ANNOYING IT MAYBE VEN PAINFUL BUT WHET AM WELL RESTED THINGS ARE GOING BETTER IT'S NOT THAT THAT SO TO TELL US MORE ABOUT AFFECT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ANCER POINT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND EMOTIONS IN OURSELVES AND OTHER PEOPLE NER SCIENTISTS THINK ABOUT THE SENSORY SYSTEMS FOR TOUCH AND PROPRIACEPTION WHICH WE CALL SOMAD A SENSATION AS BEING IN THE SERVICE OF MOTOR SKELER MOTOR MOVEMENTS YOU REALLY THE OUR SENSE OF TOUCH AND EVEN VISION ACTUALLY ALSO WORKS THIS WAY AM AND YE AND ACTUALLY ADDITION DOES TO THESE SENSES ACTUALLY SERVE IN AM THE BRAINS ABILITY TO UM CONTROL THE MOVEMENTS OF THE BODY AND THE SAME THING IS TRUE A FOR THE AM REGULATING THE SYSTEMS OF THE BODY SO BRAINS ONE OF THEIR FUNDAMENTAL JOBS ARE TO CO ORDINATE AND AM REGULATE THE SYSTEMS INSIDE YOUR BODY YOUR HEART YOUR LUNGS YOU'RE GOT YOU KNOW ALL THE MOVING PARTS AND THE INFORMATION THE THE SENSORY SIGNALS THAT THAT THOSE AM ORGANS AND AND TISSUES IN SO ON SEND BACK TO THE BRAIN AM AS I SAID BEFORE THOSE SENSORY SIGNALS ARE IMPORTANTTO THE BRAINS ABILITY TO REGULATE THE BODY BUT WE DON'T FEEL THEM DIRECTLY WE USUALLY EXPERIENCE THEM AS AFFECTIVE FEELINGS THESE VERY SIMPLE PHYSICAL SORTS OF FEELINGS AND THEN WE ELABORATE THEM IN VARIOUS WAYS THEY THEY REALLY WHEN THEY GET VERY INTENSE THAT THOSE ARE THE MOMENTS WHEN THE BRAIN CREATES US TO CREATES AMOTION OUT OF THEM SO THE BRAINS REGULATION OF THE BODY THE PREDICTIVE REGULATION OF THE BODY IS THE TECHNICAL TERM IS ALLOW STASIS BUT WHEN I'M EXPLAINING THIS TO THE PUBLIC I USE A METAPHOR AND YOU KNOW ALL METAPHORS ARE WRONG BUT SOME METAPHORS ARE LESS WRONG AND USEFUL SO THE METAPHOR THAT I USE IS EM YOUR BRAIN IS RUNNING A BUDGET FOR YOUR BODY AND IT'S NOT BUDGETING MONEY IT'S BUDGET IN GLUE COASTS AND SALT IN OXYGEN AND WATER AN ALL THE NEUTRIENTS THAT YOU NEED TO STAY ALIVE AND WELL AND SO YOU CAN THINK ABOUT WITHDRAWALS FROM THAT BUDGET LIKE BURNING GLUE COASE OR USING UP OXYGEN UM YOU CAN THINK ABOUT DEPOSITS LIKE SLEEPING AND EATING UM YOU CAN THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW SAVINGS UM SO WHEN YOU'RE WITH AFRIEND WHO YOU TRUST AND YOU KNOW EVERYTHING YOU DO ACTUALLY IS JUST SLIGHTLY LESS METABLE EXPENSSO RIGHT AND YOU CAN ALSO THINK ABOUT TAXES UM LIKE IF YOU ARE STRESSE SOCIALLY STRESSED WITHIN TWO HOURS OF EATING A MEAL THAT SAME MEAL WILL COST YOU A HUND AND THE EQUIVALENT OF A HUNDRED AND FOUR MORE CALLERIES IN THE INEFFICIENCY THAT YOU WILL METABOLIZE IT BECAUSE OF THAT STRESS UEM ME YOU'LL BURN MORE ENERGY YOU'LL BE MORE INEFFICIENT IN METABOLIZING THE FOOD SO IT'S AS IF YOU HAD EATEN A HUNDRED FOUR MORE CALORYSO I HAV EXACTLY BACKER AND SO OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR THAT'S ELEVEN POUNDS SO WHEN WE SAY THAT PEOPLE ARE TAXIN ALMOST YET WE'D LIKE IT'S LITERALLY THERE ER LANGUAGE WOULD ASK THAR ER LANGUAGE WORDS GO THE WAY I DESCRIBE IT IS THAT YOU CAN THINK ABOUT AFFECT AS A QUICK AND DIRTY SUMMARY OF THE STATE OF YOUR BODY BUDGET IF THINGS ARE GOING REASONABLY WELL THEN YOU'LL FEEL OQUET YOU MIGHT EVEN FEEL PLEASANT IF YOU'RE RUNNING A DEFASIT IN YOUR BODY BUDGET THEN YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL FATIGUED OR WE'RE DISTRESSED AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN SOMETHING IS NECESSARILY WRONG LIKE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU EXERCISE YOU GET TO A CERTAIN POINT WHERE YOU'VE REACHED YOUR VANTILATORY LOAD USUALLY IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW TWENTY MINUTES IN OR TEN MINUTES IN OR WHATEVER O BEING A HARGER WORKING AND YOU SRY TO FEEL UNPLEASANT AND FATIGUED BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT SOMETHING'S WRONG THAT JUST MEANS THAT YOU'RE WORKING REALLY HARD AND YOU HAVE TO PUSH THROUGH IT AND THEN YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE YOU KNOW DRINK WATER AND YOU KNOW YOU EAT AFTERWARDS IN REPLENISHIAND THEN YOU'RE FUNE RIGHT IN FACT YOU'RE BETTER IT'S IT'S A A WAY OF UNBUILDING A BETTER STRONGER FUTURE YOU SO AFFECT IS BASICALLY YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN THINGS WHEN YOU FEELLY REALLY WORKED UP IT PROBABLY MEANS THAT SOMETHING'S UNCERTAIN SOMEWHERE SO I JUST THINK OF BAT THESE AS LIKE QUICK AND DIRTY WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT YOU'RE YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'R AFFECT MEANS AND UM AND THEN OFTENTIMES AS WE'VE SAID BEFORE EMOTION REGULATION THAT IS CONTROLLING EMOTION REALLY ACTUALLY IT'S NOT SO MUCH ABOUT CHANGING THE MEANING OF AFFCT IT'S CHANGING THE AFFECT UM AND UM SO IT'S USEFUL TO UNDERSTAND THAT AFFECT IS TIED TO THE STATE OF YOUR BODY OR ACTUALLY WHAT IS TIED TO IS YOUR BRAINS BELIEFS ABOUT THE STATE OF YOUR BODY YOURE BRAIN IS MODELLING THE STATE OF THE BODY AND THAT'S IN TERRACEPTION THAT'S THE TECHNICAL WORD AN TERRECEPTION IS NOT YOU'RE AWARENESS OF YOUR BODY IT'S YOUR BRAINS MODELLING OF YOUR BODY WHAT YOURE BRAIN BELIEVES TO BE TRUE ABOUT THE METABOLIC STATE OF YOUR BODY AND THAT'S HOW I THINK ABOUT AFFECT THAT'S HOW I THING ABOUT MY OWN AFFECT THAT'S AND MY DAUGHTER ACTUALLY WHO UM YOU KNOW WAS DEPRESSED FOR SO I SHOULD SAY DEPRESSION IS LIKE A BANKRUPT BODY BUDGET LIKE YOU JUST CAN'T MOVE YOU FEEL FATIGUE SO FATIGUED THAT YOU CAN'T MOVE AND YOU'RE V ERY DISTRESSED IS LIKE BANKRUPTCY AND ACTUALLY IF YOU I MEAN DEPRESSION IS A METABOLIC ILLNESS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION THEY REALLY ARE ABOUT METABOLIC UM HAVING METABOLIC DEPISITS BASICALLY AND IT'S INTERESTING THAT ONE OF THE HOLLMARKED FEATURES OF DEPRESSION SUBJECTIVELY SPEAKING IS E LACK OF POSITIVE ANTICIPATION ABOUT THE FUTURE WHICH MAKES PERFECT SENSE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A DEPLEDED GRANDBODY BOUT YOU YES EXACTLY YOUR AND YOUR BASICALLY THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT PREDICTION ERROR WRIGHT SO IF YOU'RE FEELING UNPLEASANT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ANTICIPATING PLEASANT THINGS AND EVEN IF THOSE THINGS THAT ARE IN THE WORLD COULD GIVE YOU PLEASURE YOU WON'T NOTICE THEM BECAUSE LEARNING FROM PREDICTION ERROR THINGS THAT YOU DIDN'T PREDICT IS EXPENSIVE AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES YOU'RE NOCK ON I RIGHT SO IT'S BUT ANYWAY'S MY DAUGHTER CAME UP WITH THIS UM AFTER WE HAD THIS VERY INTERESTING THING THAT HAPPENED TO US AT ANOTHER TRIP AND WE WERE IN SWEDEN BECAUSE I WAS GIVING A A KEEN OT AT THE CAROLINSKA INSTITUTE AND WE WENT I TOOK HER TO SWEDEN AND THIS IS WHEN SHE WAS RECOVERING FROM DEPRESSION AND LIKE YOU KNOW SHE IS JUST ONE OF THE MILLIONS OF YOUN ADULTS WHO YOU KNOW ADOLESCENCE AND YOUNG ADULSE WHO WRS EXPERIENCING DEPRESSION AND I WE GOT TO SWEDEN AND SHE WAS VERY VERY JET LAG WE BOTH WERE WAS LIKE ONE OF THESE LIKE YOU KNOW WE HAD TO LIKE YO PLAINS TRAINS AN AUTOMOBILEIL JUST YON GETTING THERE AND SHE WOOK UP THE NEXT MORNING AND SHE WESHE LOOKED HORRIBLE SHE FELT HORRIBLE IT ACTUALLY SEEMED TO ME LIKE SHE WAS ABOUT TO ENTER ANOTHER DEPRESSIVE EPISODE AND I SAID TO HER I BASIALLY GOT HER OUT OBED I FED HER A MEAL I GAVE HER FOUR I BEPROPHEN AND I PUT HER BACK TO SLEEP AND SHE GOT UP FIVE HOURS LA TE WHEN SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY FINE HER MOOD WAS FINE NOWI'M NOT TELLING YOU THAT I BE PROPHIN IS THE AN ANY TOPRESSON THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE IF YOU'RE DEPRESSED BUT WHAT I'M TELLING YOU IS THAT YOU KNOW YOU SAID SOMETHING ANTRY THAT WAS SO INTERESTING IN THE BEING GINNING YOU SID AM I FATIGUED DOES MY BODY DO I HAVE PAIN SOMEWHERE AS MY BODY HURT YOU KNOW THESE ARE WELL RIGHT WHEN BASICALLY WHAT SHE WAS HAVING WAS SHE WAS FATIGUED AND SHE WAS HAVING WHAT I WOULD CALL UM MISS CALLED THE TECHNICAL WORD IS VICERAL NO SUCEPTION WHICH MEANS HER STOMACH HURT HER YOU KNOW EVERYTHING HURT AND SURE YOU KNOW HER MUSCLES TROUBLE HER TO BUT IT WAS REALLY HURT IN URDS REALLY SHE JUST WAS DISTRESSED AND THE UM THE I BE PRPHAND HELPED HER GET BACK TO SLEEP AND THEN SHE SLEPT AND SHE GOT UP AND SHE WAS COMPLETELY FINE AND THEN WE WALKED AROUND STALK HOME FOR THE REST OF THE DAY TALKING ABOUT THIS EXPERIENCE WHICH FOR HER WAS LIKE FLIPPING ON A LIGHTSWITCH YOU KNOW HOW EMOTIONS ARE MADE THIS BOOK THAT I REFERRED TO I WROTE THAT BOOK FOR HER I WROTE THAT BOOK FOR HER BUT ALSO FOR ME BECAUSE IT WAS A WAY OF PUTTING DOWN ON PAPER ALL THE THINGS THAT I WANTED HER TO KNOW THAT AND THAT I THOUGHT OTHER PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THEIR KIDS YOU KNOW AND MAYBE EVEN THEIR KIDS COULD READ IT BUT WHAT SHE DID WITH THAT WHAC SHE CAME UP WITH A NEW CONCEPT CALLED THE EMOTIONAL FLEW AND THE EMOTIONAL FLEW IS WHEN YOU'RE HAVING A BAD BODY BUDGETING DAY AND YOU'R JUST LIKE YOUDN'T GET ENOUGH SLEEP MAY BE OR YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME STRESS AT AT WORKER AT SCHOOL THAT YOU CAN'T GET RID OF OTHERWISE YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND LIKES TO SAY WELL A YOU KNOWE OTHER PEOPLE'S OPINIONS OF YOU ARE JUST ELECTRICA LECTIVITY IN SOMEBODY'S HEAD WHICH I LOVE LIKE ESTER'S ANOTHER WAY OF CATEGORISING IT A SORT OF LIKE TAKING APART THE TAKING A PART THE CUP INTO PIECES OF LIGHT RIGHT AND SO WHATEVER THERE'RE JUST THESE MOMENTS WHERE YOU FEEL TOPLEADED AND YOU COULD USE THAT I MEAN THAT WE USUALLY WE OFTEN USE AFFECT TO AS A AS A INDICATOR OF HOW THE WORLD IS YOU KNOW IF I FEEL BAD SOMETHING MUST BE BAD WRONG IN THE WORLD BUT YOU AVE TO RESIST THAT SOMETIMES BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG IN THE WORLD THIT'S JUST THAT YOU DIDN' GETTING OF SLEEP OR YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE YOU KNOW PROTINE OR MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T GONE FOR A WALK AND YOU'RE STIFF OR WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO SOME STRETCHING AR THOSE THAT AS SARGE INTEURUPE BUT I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WANT TO ANCHOR TO A FEW OF THESE A YOU POSITIVE STEPS THAT THEY CAN TAKE TO RETO I DON'T SAY REPLENISH BUT TO SHIFT AFFECT IN POSITIVE DIRECTIONS A SLEEP MOVEMENT NUTRITION YES AND I'VE HEARD YOU SAY BEFORE THAT WE ARE ESSENTIALLY A MENO ACID FORGING MACHINES SO YE I KNOCE YOU SAID PROTINE YOU DIDN'T SAY YOU NEED A BAGAL YOU SAID PROTINE UM WE CAN GO DOWN THAT RABBIT HOLE MAYBE MAYBE WE DO MAYBE WE DON'T BUT I WANT TO USE THIS AL SO JUST AS A QUICK OPPORTUNITI S SAY AS YOU'RE SAYING ALL THIS ONE CAN IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTAND WHY ALCOHOL AND DRUGS OF ABUSE ARE BOTH SO COMPELLING RIGHT YOU'RE NOT FEELING WELL YASO TAKE YOUR FEELING UN TIRED TAKE A STIMULANT THAT RELEASES DO ARMING IN UP AN EFFRND BUT YOU'R TAXING YOU'RE ALREADY TAXED BODY BUDGET YES IN A WAY THAT THEN PUTS YOU IN A MORE TO PLEADED STATELY OR ALCOHOL LIKE YET YOU FEEL LOUSY A ALCHALL NEVER DID THIS FOR ME BUT FRIENDS I HAVE WHO ARE RECOVERED ALCOHOLICS WILL TELL ME THAT IT WAS LIKE A MAGIC A LIXER AN MADE THEM FEEL RIGHT THE HS THEIR LANGUAGE BUT THEN OF COURSE THERE'S A PRICE TO PAY LATER BECAUSE THAN IT DROPS YOUR BASE LINE BELOW WHERE IT WASN'T A SH ABSOLUTELY ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED AND TEM PER SENT T I JUST ALSO WEN TO SAY THAT SO IS SERATONE AND LIKE SO AR SO IS SO ARESSASAR EYES MAYBE AND WHEN I SAY MAYBE WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS IF YOU REALLY HAVE A METABOLIC PROBLEM LIKE SAY SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH YOUR METACONDRIA OR YOU'RE RECOVERING FROM AN ILLNESS AND YOU KNOW THAT WERE WERE THERE'S JUST SOME METABALI PROM IN YOUR BODY THAT METABAL PROM IS REAL IF YOU START TO FEEL UNPLEASANT YOU WILL I MEAN FEEL UNPLEASANT YOU WILL FEEL YOUR MOOD WILL BE NEGATIVE IF YOU STARE TAKING SRATO IF YOU STARE TAKING ESSESS OR EYES WHICH WILL LEAVE MORE SARATONE AND IN THE SCYNAPSES OF YOUR A NER ON'S BEFORE ITS RIT'S TAKEN UP AGAIN THAT WILL DUCE THE SYSTEM YOU WILL BE ABLE SUSPEND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO MOVE YOU'LL FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE MORE ENERGY FOR A WHILE BUT YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS IS A COMPLEX SYSTEM AND SO IT'S GOING TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS ELSEWHERE TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THAT BUDGETING PROBLEM SO EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TAKE DRUGS OF ABUSE AND HAT WHAT HAPPENS ON THE SHORT TERM CAN HAPPEN FOR SOME PEOPLE WITH ESSESS OR EYES ON THE LONGER TERM WEARE AT FIRST TO SARCS TO WORK AND THEN ITS STOPT STOPS WORKING AND YOU START TO GAIN WAIT AND YOU KNOW AND YOUR BECAUSE YOUR METABOLISM IS SLOWING BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN IS ATTEMPTING TO DEAL WITH THAT WITH THAT BUDGETING PROBLEM SO IT REALLY MATTERS WHAT THE YOU KNOW WHAT THE SOURCE IS IT COULD BE THAT YOUR BRAIN BELIEVES YOU HAVE A BUDGETING PROBLEM BUT THERE REALLY ISN'T ONE IT COULD BE THAT THE REALLY IS ONE THESE THINGS MATTER TO HOW YOU TREAT IT ONE THING UT I AM JUST MENTION ABOUT ASSESSORISE AND I UNFORTUNATELY FOR REASONS O CONFIDENTIALITY I CAN'T PSIT THE SOURCE ON THIS BUT LET ME TO SAY THAT SOMEBODY ISE HIGHLY INFORMED IN THE IN THE LANDSCAPE OF OF FORMER SUITICAL TREATMENTS FOR AM PSYCHIATRIC CHALLENGES HAS TOLD ME THAT THERE'S AN EMERGING THEORY AMONG PSYCHIATRICES KIND OF A COLLECTIVE EMERGING THEORY THAT AM ONE OF THE REASONS WHY NOWADAYS YOU HEARABOUT SO CALLED TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION BUT YOU DID NOT HEAR ABOUT SO CALLED TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION PRIOR TO THE ADVENT OF ASSESSORISE IS THAT THERE'S A GROWING BODY OF THOUGHT IN THE PSYCHIATRIC COMMUNITY THE ASSESSORISE MAY OVERTIME AS YOUR POINTING OUT DEPLETE THE VERY N ERAL SYSTEMS THAT SUBGER ENHANCED MOOD SO IT'S IT'S DIFFERENT THIN A DRUG OF ABUSE THAT GIVES YOU A VERY ACUTE EFFECT LIKE MATHEM PHETAMINE OR COHANE OR ALCOHOL BUT THAT OVER TIME YOU MAY ACTUALLY BE PULLING THE VERY NERAL CIRCUITS AND NOR CHEMICALS THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR POSITIVE AFFECT DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE TRENCHES UM YE SO TO SPEAK AND SO THERE'S A GROWING NUMBER PEOPLE WHO SIMPLY DON'T RESPOND TO THE DRUGS ANY LONGER OR OTHER TREATMENTS RIGHT SO I WASN'T TRYING TO SAY THE MECHANISM IS THE SAME I WAS BASICALLY SAYING THE THEME IS THE SAME AND THAT I'M AGREING WITH YAT WHAT HAPPENS OVER THE SHORE TERM WITH DRUGS IF ABUSE HAPPENS OVER THE LONGER TERM WITH FOR SOME PEOPLE WITH US AS ARISE BECAUSE IT HASN'T BEEN RECOGNIZED YET THAT THE THAT AT THE BASIS DEPRESSION IS A METABOLIC PROBLEM AND WHEN YOU HAVE A METABOLIC PROBLEM LIKE DIBETIES OR OBESITY OR LIKE A WER A HART DISEASE IT'S NOT THAT THAT CAUSES DEPRESSION IT'S THAT THERE IS A CONFIN PROBLEM WHICH IS THAT SOMEWHERE IN THIS VERY COMPLEX SYSTEM OF YOUR METABOLISM THERE'S THERE THERE IS A DRAG AND IT PRODUCES NEGATIVE MOOD AND THAT'S HOW YOU EXPERIENCE IT SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD NOT TO TURN IT'S PRODUCTIVE NOT TO TURN A THAT NEGATIVE AFFECT INTO AN EMOTION SOMETIMES YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THE CIGAR IS JUST AS CIGAR SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED TO DEAL WITH THE AFFECTIVE PROBLEM BY DEALING WITH THE PHYSICAL YOUR PHYSICAL STATE AND THAT'S THE TRICKY BIT IS KNOWING WHEN IS AFFECT TELLING YOU SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE WORLD AND WHEN IS IT TELLING YOU THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR PHYSICAL STATE THAT YOU NEED ATTEND TO I THINK EVERYTHING TO ME AT LEAST STARTS WITH A GOOD NIGHTS SLEEP ON A CASTON BASIS AND AND EVERY PSYCHIATRIC CHALLENGE AND INDEED SUICIDE ITSELF UM IT SEEMS TO BE ASOCIATED WITH AND OFTEN PRECEDED BY CHALLENGES IN SLEEPING ALKIN AT ISN IN IN CIRCATING RHYTHM SO I THINK UM THAT'S WHY HT TO ME SLEEP IS THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH ABSOLUTELY INSO WHEN I TELL PEOPLE WHEN THEY SAY WHAT CAN I DO AS THEY WOF THERE'S ONLY IF THERE IS ONLY ONE THING THAT YOU COULD PICK I WOULD SAY GET GET A GOOD NICHE SLEEP ON A REGULAR BASIS IF YOU COULD PICK TO MORE I WOULD SAY EAT HEALTHFULLY LIKE STOP EATING SUDO FOOD DON'T GET ME WRONG LIKE I LOVE FRENCH RISE I LOVE FRENCH WRISE THEY ARE LIKE THAT'S LIKE GODS WITH PERFECT FOOD I'M REALLY BUT EAT HEALTHFULLY THEY EAT REAL FOOD AND GET EXERCISE AND IF YOU DO THOSE THREE THINGS I KNOW I SOUND LIKE A MOTHER AND SO FEEL FER TO ROLL YOUR EYES AT ME BUT AS A NEAR SCIENTISTS THOSE ARE THE ACTUALLY BEFORE YOU START U WITH ALL THE BEKNO MENTALIZING JEDIE TRICKS YOU COULD JUST START WITH THIS AND THAT WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE YOU PRETTY FAR AND AN UM AND THAT WILL RESINATE VERY WELL WITH OUR AUDIENCE EM THE BASICS OF SLEEP EXERCISE FOOD SUNLIGHT AND SOCIAL CONNECTION O ONE IS ANXIOUS AND GAND THOSE FIVE OR THE ONES THAT THAT WE JUST KEEP RETURNING TO OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND I THINK PEOPLE SAY ALL WHAT'S JUST SIMPLE A MOTHERLY ADVICE BUT I WOULD I THINK THAT THOSE FIVE THINGS EVEN JUST THE ONE THING AROUND SLEEP THAT THERE'S SOME WORK THAT'S REQUIRED TO GET THAT DONE SO IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE THE CATEGORIES ARE SIMPLE BUT THE WORK THAT'S REQUIRED TO GET GREAT SLEEP AS OFTEN AS ONE CAN ON A CONSISTENT BASIS IF YOUR RAISING KIDS HAVE A CAREER  LIVE IN THE WORLD AM THERE'S A LOT THERE AND SO THAT'S WHERE I THINK THERE'S THERE'S A THERE'S AN ELABORATION OF OF THINGS AND ENE NEADS O LEARN TO BE FLEXIBLE LIKE WHER'SE TRAVELING HOW DO YOU DO THAT WHEN BE NO FRIENDS ARE VISITING HOW DO YOU DO THAT WHEN WEATHERS OFF IT AND SO ON A THAT THE RELATIONSHIP PIECES IM ISCAN I I RES ANI SO LAT YOU MENGION THAT YEOL LAT YOU BAN BECAUSE YOU SAID BEFORE AND AND THIS WAS ANOTHER ON THOSE MOMENTS I LISTEN TO A LISTEN TOS MANY OF YOUR PODCAST AS I POSSIBLY CAN BUT YES I THINK IT WAS THE FIRST OF THE SECOND ONE WITH LEXS FREEDMEN UM WHERE YOU SAID YOU KNW WE ARE REGULATING EACH OTHERS NERVOUS SYSTEMS I WILL NEVER FORGET AND YOU KNOW I IMAGINE THAT YOU MARRIED YOUR HUSBAND FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REASONS BUT AM WHEN PEOPLE PAIR UP WITH ROMANTIC PARTNERS WITH FRIENDS WITH CO WORKERS THE IDEAL SITUATION IS ONE IN WHICH WE ARE NOT TAXED WHERE MAYBE EVEN PEOPLE AND JUST BEING AROUND THEM ORE JUST KNOWING THAT THEY ARE IN OUR LIVES PROVIDES A SORT OF DEPOSIT TO YET IT'S A SAVINGS IT PROVIDES TE SAVINGS FOR SURE AND THEN I THINK THAT'S A LOT OF WHAT EMOTIONAL RESIDENCE TO PLACK ON A POP LANGUAGE ON IT IT ISIS ALL ABOUT YET WHO FEELS GOOD TO BE AROUND WHO DOESN'T FEEL GA YETERI WOULD SAY THE BEST THING FOR A HUMAN NERVOUS SYSTEM IS ANOTHER HUMAN AND THE WORST THING FOR HUMAN NERVOUS SYSTEM IS ALSO ANOTHER HUMAN AND SO YOU REALLY WANT TO BE AROUND THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE YOU THE BEST THE BEST VERSION OF YOURSELF THAT YOU COULD BE AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU ALWAYS GET A SAVINGS LIKE SOMETIMES YEAR SOMETIMES YOU ARE TAKING CARE OF THAT PERSON AND SO YOURE YOU'RE ABSORBING SOME OF THE THEIR BURDEN RIGHT AND VICE VERSA BUT I WOULD SAY THE RESEARCH ON YOU KNOW SOCIAL ICILLATION AND LONELINESS AND SO ON SHOWS US THAT YOU NONT WHELE ALONG WITH RESEARCH ON SYNCRANY AND THERE'S JUST A WHOLE BUNCH OF RESEARCH TO TO SUGGEST THAT A WE ARE THE CURETAKERS OF EACH OTHER'S NERVOUS SYSTEMS AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR OPINION IS IT DOESN'T YOU KNOW IT JUST BUT WE JUST THAT'S HOW WE EVOLVED THA SPECIES AND SO YOU GET TO DECIDE WHAT KIND OF A PERSON ARE YOU GOING TO BE YOU KNOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE ARE YOU GOING TO BE A SAVINGS ARE YOU GOING TO BE A TACKS AND IN GENERAL IT SEEMS THAT PEOPLE WHO DECIDE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE A SAVINGS AM TAND TO BECAUSE PEOPLE GRAVITATE TOWARDS THAT WANT MORE OF THAT YEAND HOPEFULLY WOULD PROVIDE THAT ALSO I'MAND I THINK THE RECIPROCITY PCERE FEELS FROM REALLY STRONG WELL THAT'S OVVERLY INTERESTING TING ABOUT M ABOUT THE SYNCRANY WORK CRITSO THERE'S WORK THAT IF YOU RESEARCS THAT IF YOU PUT PEOPLE TOGETHER WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW EACH OTHER BUT IF THEY IF THEY LIKE EACH OTHER IN THEY THEY HAVE A SENSE OF TRUST EVEN AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES THEY START TO SYNCHRANIZE THEIR PHYSICAL SIGNALS IR HARTRATE SARTS TO SYNCRANIZE THEIR MOVEMENTS SARJES SYNCHENIZE THARE HARTLY PROBABLY SYNCRANIZES CAUSE THEIR BREATHING STARTS TO SYNCHRONIZE RIGHT AND IT'S REALLY INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT YOU WHAT YOU TYPICALLY SEE IS THAT WHO IS PACING AND WHO IS LEADING LIKE ONE PERSON IS THE LEADER AND THEN THE OTHER PERSON IS THE PACER AM I GOT THAT LANGUAGE FROM WHEN I LEARNED HYBNOS US BY THE WAY AND AM BUT IT SWITCHES BACK AND FORTH LIKE WHO'S THE LEADER LIKE IN I IN A GOOD IN A INAT WHAT WE SAY GOOD LIKE ANA IN AN INTERACTION THAT LOOKS PRODUCTIVE IT ITS SWITCHING ALL THE TIME WHO IS WHO IS PACING AND WHO IS LEADING IT'S NOT THAT ALWAYS ONE PERSON IS IS AM IS IN CHARGE SO TO SPEAK PHYSIOLOGICALLY SPEAKING WE DID AS SERIES RECENTLY ON MENTAL HEALTH WITH PALCONTI WHOS A UM PSYCHATRIS AN THE WORD NARSICISM CAME UP A FEW TIMES BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT YON HE UM EMPHASIZE THAT NARSISISTS ARE NOT CONFIDENT THEY THEY OPERATE FROM A PLACE OF OF A DEFASIT OF PLEASURE IT'S NEVER ENOUGH AND AN INTENSE ENVY ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT HOW THEY PRESENT AND THEIRE OFTEN USUALLY NOT AWARE OF IT THEMSELVES BUT IT'S WHAT LEADS HEALTHY PEOPLE TO FEEL AS IF THE INTERACTIONS WITH THOSE PEOPLE NARSES OFTEN CAN BE VERY COMPELLING IN THE MOMENT BUT THEY FEEL VERY TAXED AFTER WORDS IN KIND OF CONFUSED BY WHAT HAPPENED AND IT SOUNDS LIKE IT A TIES BACK TO THIS LACK OF SYNCRANY UM ON THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THINGS UM IT'S ALSO CLEAR FROM WHAT YOU JUST SAID THAT WHEN PEOPLE REGULATE EACH OTHER'S NERVOUS SYSTEMS IN A WAY WHERE PEOPLE ARE MAKING LITTLE DEPOSITS IN PROVIDING SAVINGS FOR EACH OTHER OR MAYBE THINGS ARE JUST NEUTRAL THAT UM THOSE NERVOUS SYSTEMS ARE THEN IN A POSITION TO PAY ATTENTION OTHER THINGS TOO AND M  NOT JUST TRYING WORK OUT THE DYNAMICS OH FOR SURE U OH AND THAT'S VERY TRUE AT WORK SO THERE'S RESEART SHOWING THAT I'M ESPECIALLY IN THE CREATIVITY YOU KNOW SECTOR INNOVATION SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY THE BEST PREDICTOR OF PERFORMANCE ON THE JOB IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH PEOPLE FEEL AN WE AFTER YOU ACCOUNT FOR SLEEP AND AND YOU KNOW WATERING AND SLEEPING AND FEEDING RIGHT LIKE THE THAT AM THE BEST PREDICTOR IS THE AMOUNT OF TRUST THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR TEAM AND IN YOU'RE MANAGERS BECAUSE IF THE WORLD IS PREDICTABLE COULD STILL BE THINGS CULD BE HARD EVEN WHEN THINGS ARE UNPREDICTABLE YOU HAVE PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHO HAVE YOUR BACK AND SO BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE YOU'RE UM THEY'RE MAKING YOU KNOW DEPOSITS OR SAVINGS THEI'RE CAUSING SAVINGS IN EACH OTHER'S BODY BUT JIT'S SO THERE THEIR RESOURCES CAN BE SPENT ON THE HARDER THINGS WHICH IS YOU KNOW FAILING AND YOU KNOW CAN'T HAVING TO PICK YOURSELF BACK UP AND TRY AGAIN WHICH IS YOU KNOW PARTLY WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE AN INNOVATOR SO I THINK THAT THERE'S ALSO RECERS TO SHOW THAT IN YOUR PERSONAL LIFE WHEN YOU DO RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS FOR PEOPLE OR WHEN YOU'RE KIND IN GENERAL YOU DRIVE ALSO A BODY BUDGETING BENEFIT FROM THAT AM YOU KNOW SO FOR A WHILE I HAD A FRIEND WHO AM WE WOULD MEET EACH OTHER FOR LUNCH ONCE A MONTH AND YOU KOW WE WOULD TAKE TURNS PAYING AND WEN WE COULD BOTH PAY FOR OURSELVES BUT WEV GOT A GOT A DOUBLE HIT YOU KNOW HE PAID FOR ME ONE MONTH AND THEN I WOULD PAY FOR HIM ONE MONTH AND THEN YO KNOW SO WE GET THE DOUBLE HIT OF A YOU KNOW BEING KIND TO SOME ONE ELSE AND I YOU KNOW AND ALSO THEY GOT THE YOU KNOW BENEFIT OF SOME ONE BEING KIND TO THEM AND I'LL JUST SAY I THINK KINDNESS IS A I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE SO MANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT IN OUR CULTURE RIGHT NOW BUT I THINK KNDNESS IS VERY VERY UNDERATED AND SHOULD BE YOU KNOW LIKE WHEN I'M WHEN MY WHEN I FEEL LIKE SHIT I BAKE BREAD FOR MY NEIGHBOUR WHO IS IN HIS SEVENTIES HIM AND HIS WIFE THAT'S WHAT I DO WHEN I YOU KNOW WHEN I'M NOT FEELING GOOD AND YOU KNOW FI OU MEAN AFTER I HAVE TAKEN CARE OF THE PHYSICAL THE POSSIBLE O PHYSICAL CAUSES I AND THEN I FEEL GREAT BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS SO HE'S ALWAYS SO GRATEFUL AND AND THEN I FELT LIKE I MADE HIS DAY BETTER AND THEN ALSO HE HELPS ME INOTHER WAYS LIKE WITH MY GARDEN AND STUFF CAUSE HE'S JUST LIKE A MASTER GARDENER AND SO I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE THIS RELATIONSHIP WHERE WE HELP EACH OTHER AND I KNOW IT SOUNDS REALLY SAPPY BUT AND EVEN THOUGH ALL THE RESEARCH BACKS UP WHAT I'M SAYING I IT DOESN'T QUITE DESCRIBE THE FEELING OF WHEN SOME ONE IS JUST REALLY HAPPY BECAUSE YOU JUST GAVE THEM A LITTLE SURPRISE AND THERE YOU KNOW LIKE THAT THAT THERE'S JUST SOME JUCE IN THAT I THINK ON SOME CULTURE OUT THERE THERE'S A WORD FOR THAT I'M SOING ARELA  I SURE THEAS WELL IHAVE TO SAY AM I'VE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THIS CONVERSATION NO YU I IAVE BEEN LOOKING FORWR TO IT FOR A LONG TIME AND YOU'VE PROVIDED US WITH A REALLY BROAD ARC BUT ALSO A DEEP DIVE INTO NOT JUST HOW EMOTIONS ARE MADE NOT JUST ABOUT AFFECT BUT AS YOU MENTION EARLY OR  REALLY HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WORKS AND I AM CERTAIN IN FACT THAT OUR AUDIENCES TAKING THIS IN AND REALIZING THAT THAT KNOWLEDGE IS INCREDIBLY POWERFUL THE THE ADDITION OF NEW AUNTS BUT TO LANGUAGE INTO SOR SELF REFLECTION STATES AM AS EXTREMELY VALUABLE IN OFTEN TIMES WHEN ONE GETS INTO CONVERSATION THAT HAS SOME LEVEL OF REDUCTIONISM AND YOU GET INTO NOMING CLATURE AN THINGS LIKE THAT IT CAN REALLY PULL AWAY FROM THE REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE OF SOMETHING BUT THIS IS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE WHAT YOU'VE DONE

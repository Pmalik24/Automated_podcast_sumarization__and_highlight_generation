WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN L SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TOE I MA INDRHUBERMEN AND O'M PROFESSOR NUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHOMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICN TO DAY WE ARE DISCUSSING FITNESS A FITNESS OF COURSE IS VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR CARTEVASCULAR HEALTH FOR STRENGTH FOR ENDURANCE FOR LIFE SPAN FOR HEALTH SPAN I CAN THINK OF ANY ONE OUT THERE THAT WOULDN'T WANT TO HAVE HEALTHY HORMONAL FUNCTION HEALTHY CARTY OF ASCULAR FUNCTION TO LIVE A LONG TIME AND TO FEEL VITAL THAT IS TO HAVE A LONG HEALTH SPAN AS WELL AS A LONG LIFE SPAN FITNESS AND FITNESS PROTOCOLS ARE TREMENDOUSLY POWERFUL FOR DEVELOPING ALL OF THAT HOWEVER DESPITE THEIR BEING AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF INFORMATION OUT THEIR ON THE INTERNET AN IN BOOKS AND ELSEWHERE IT CAN BE A BIT OVERWHELMING SO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS REALLY DESIGNED TO SYMTHESIZE SCIENCE BASE TOOLS THAT WE'VE COVERED ON THE PODCAST SOME WITH EXPERT GUESS LIKE DOCTOR ANY GALPIN OR DOCTOR PETER A TA OR WORLD RENOWND MOVEMENT SPECIALIST EATO PORTALL OR FPHYSIOTHERAPISTS AND STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING COACH GEFF CAVALIER WE'VE HAD ALL OF THEM ON ITS GUESTS ON THE PODCAST AND EACH AN EVERY ONE OF THEM PROVIDED A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE IN TERMS OF THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO OPTIMIZE VERY SPECIFIC OR MULTIBLE ASPECTS OF FITNESS TODAY WE'RE GAN NO TO DO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN USUAL TYPICALLY ON THE HUBERMAN LAD PODCAST I OFFER MECHANISM UP FRONT OR FIRST AND THEN WE TALK ABOUT PROTOCALS THAT YOU CAN USE THAT REALLY LEAN ON THOSE SCIENCE AND SCIENCE BASED MECHANISMS TO DAY I'M GOING TO DESCRIBE A SPESIFIC PROTOCOL THAT SERVES AS A GENERAL TEMPLET THAT ANYONE IN FACT EVERY ONE CAN YOU USE IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE ALL ASPECTS OF FITNESS SO THAT INCLUDES ENDURANCE STRENGTH FLECTSIBILITY HYPERTROPHY ESTHETIC CHANGES ET CETERA HOWEVER THIS GENERAL FRAME WORK CAN ALSO BE MODIFY THAT IS CUSTOMIZE TO YOUR PARTICULAR NEEDS  IF YOU'R SOMEBODY WHO REALLY WANTS TO BUILD MORE STRENGTH OR BIGGER MUSCLES YOU CAN CHANGE THE PROTOCOL AND THAT OVER ALL PROGRAM ACCORDING TO THAT AND I'LL HOK ABOUT VERY SPECIFIC WAYS TO DO THAT OR IF YOU'R SOMEBODY WHO REALLY JUST WANTS TO MAINTAIN STRENGTH BE Y WANT TO BUILD EN DURANCE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT AND OF COURSE WE WILL COVER REAL LIFE ISSUES SUCH AS SHOULD YOU TRAIN IF YOU ARE SLEEP DEPRIVED WHAT ABOUT FOOD WHEN SHOULD YOU EAT WHAT IF YOU HAVENAN EATEN IN YOUR HUNGRY SHOULD YOU STILL TRAIN ET CETERA ET CETERA WERE GOING TO COVER ALL OF THAT AGAIN IN THE CONTECT OF THIS WHAT I WOULD ALL FOUNDATIONAL TEMPLET OF FITNESS THIS FOUNDATIONAL TEMPLET OF FITNESS IS SOMETHING THAT I PERSONALLY USE IN FACT I'VE USED IT FOR OVER THREE DECADES ARE TO BELIEVE THAT  THAT OPEN I JUST RECENTLY TERN FORTY SEVEN AND I STILL USE THIS BASIC PROTOCOL OR TEMPLET A CROSS THE WEEK AND MODIFY IT ACCORDING TO WHAT MY PARTICULAR GOALS ARE THAT YEAR THAT MONTH EVEN THAT DAY BECAUSE I LIKE YOU LIVE IN THE REAL WORLD AND SOMETIMES I'VE BEEN TRAVELING OR I MISS A WORK OUT YES IT DOES HAPPEN OR LIFE ISN'T ORGANIZED IN EXACTLY THE WAY THAT I NEED TO IN ORDER TO HAVE EVERYTHING GO ACCORDING TO THE PROTOCOL THAT'S ON PAPER SO ORGAN TO DISCUSS REAL WORLD ISSUES AND H T A WORK WITH THE REAL WORLD ISSUES IN ORDER TO GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR FITNESS PROGRAMM AND AGAIN BY THE END OF TO DAY'S PROGRAM I CAN ASSURE YOU YOU WILL HAVE A TEMPLET PROTOCOL THAT YOU CAN BUILD UP FROM BUILT OUT CHANGE AND MODIFY AND THAT WILL REALLY SERVE YOUR FITNESS GOALS ACCORDING TO THE SCIENCE AND WHAT PUREVIEWED STUDIES AND THE EXPERTS THAT APPEARED ON THIS PODCASS AND OTHER PODCASS REALLY TELL US IS BEST AND OPTIMAL FOR OUR FITNESS BEFORE WE DIVE INTO TO DAY'S CONTENT ABOUT FITNESS AND FITNESS PROTOCALS WHEN I TELL YOU ABOUT A BRAND NEW STUDY THAT IS VERY EXCITING AND FRANKLY VERY UNUSUAL THIS IS A STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHED OUT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF HUSTON EXAMINING A WHAT I WOULD CALL A MICRO EXERCISE OR A MICRO MOVEMENT IS HAT VERY SMALL MOVEMENT OF A VERY SMALL PORTION OF YOUR BODY IN FACT JUST ONE PER CENT OF YOUR MUSCULATURE THAT WHEN IT'S PERFORM CONTINUOUSLY WHILE SETED HAS LE S WHAT THEY REPORT ARE VERY DRAMATIC POSITIVE CHANGES AND TERMS OF BLOOD SUGAR UTILIZATION AND METABOLISM SO THE TITLE OF THIS STUDY IS A POTENT PHYSIOLOGICAL METHOD TO MAGNIFY AND SUSTAIN SOLIOS OXIDATE OF METABOLISM IMPROVES GLUCOSE AND LIPID REGULATION THIS STUDY WAS PUBLISHED IN I SCIENCE AND AS I MENTION EARLIER IT IS GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION AND ITS VERY UNUSUAL WITHOUT GOING INTO ALL THE DETAILS OF THE STUDY WHICH JUS BRIEFLY GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OFTHE BACKGROUND FIRST OF OIL YOU HAVE A MUSCLE CALLED THE SOLIUST THE SOLIOST MUSCLE IS A MOR O LESS WIDE FLAT MUSCLE THAT SITS BENEATH WHAT MOST PEOPLE THINK OF AS THEIR CALF ALTHOUGH ITS PART OF THE CALF MUSCLE THE OTHER PORTION THE CALF AS CALLED THE GASTRUCNEMIUS THE SOLIA SITS BELOW THAT NOW THE SOLIEST MUSCLE IS A UNIQUE MUSCLE BECAUSE IT'S LARGELY SLOW TWICH MUSCLE FIBRES IT'S DESIGN TO BE USED CONTINUOUSLY OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR STABLIZING YOUR BODY WHEN YOU'RE STANDING UPRIGHT FOR WALKING THIS IS A MUSCLE THAT'S DESIGN TO CONTRACT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN FACT YOU COULD WALK ALL DAY ON THIS MUSCLE AND MOST LIKELY IT WOULD NOT GET SORE YOU PROBABLY DONE THAT AND IT DID NOT GET SORE IN CONTRAST  A MUSCLE LIKE YOUR BISEPER YOUR TRICEP IF I WERE TO HAVE YOU PERFORM HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF REPETITIONS EVEN WITH A VERY LIGHT WEIGHT I ONE POUND WEIGHT OR TOO POUND WEIGHT EVENTUALLY IT WOULD FATIGUE YOU WOULD FEEL THAT SORT OF A BURN THERE IT'S A VERY UNUSUAL SET OF MUSCLES TO USE REPEATEDLY BUT THE SOLIASISN UNUSUAL MUSCLE IN THAT IT REALLY IS DESIGN TO BE USED CONTINUOUSLY NOW THIS STUDY WAS FOCUSED ON HOW PEOPLE WHO SIT A LOT OF THE DAY AND DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A LOT OF PHYSICAL MOVEMENT OR MAYBE WHE DON'T EVEN EXERCISE AT ALL CAN IMPROVE THEIR METABOLISM AND GLUCOSE UTILIZATION WITHOUT GOING INTO A DEEP DIVE ABOUT GLUCOSE ULIZATION BECAUSE WE'VE DONE THE DEEP DIVE ON THIS PODCASS EPISODE SUCH AS METABOLISM ET CETERA YOU CAN LOOK THOSE UP AT HUBORAN LAPDOT COM THAT ALL TIME STAMPED AND AVAILABLE THERE ANY TIME YOU EAT YOUR BLOOD SUGAR GOES UP TO SOME EXTENT SO YOUR BLOOD GLUCOS AS ITS CALL GOES UP TO SOME EXTENT AND THEN INSOLENT AS A HORMONE THAT'S USED TO ESSENTUALLY CHAPERONE A ND SEQUESTER AND USE THAT BLOOD GLUCOSERS BASICALLY THE IDEAS YOU DON'T WANT BLOOD LUCOS TO GO TOO HIGH HYPER INSOLENEMIA IS SOMETHING ASSOCIATE WITH BLOOD GLUCOSATS TOO HIGH BECAUS INSOLENT GOES UP TO ESSENTIALLY MATCH THE LEVEL OF BLOOD LUCOS YOU DON'T ALSO DON'T WANT TO BE HYPOGLIZING MIF YOU DON'T WANT O HAVE BLOOD SUGAR THAT'S TOO LOW AND INSOLENS INVOLVED IN BOTH REGULATING PEAKS AND TROUGHS IN BLOOD SUGAR BLOOD GLUCOS SO WE CAN BASICALLY SAY AND THIS IS VERY SIMPLE BUT WE CAN BASICALLY SAY THAT YOU DON'T WANT BLOOD GLUCOS TO BE ELEVATED TOO MUCH OR FOR TOO LONG THAT'S NOT GOOD IN FACT PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIOBETIENS BECAUSE THEY DON'T MAKE INSOLEN PEOPLE OFE TYPONDI BEATIES DO NOT MAKE INSOLENT AT ALL THEIR BLOOD LUCOS HAS IS SO HIGH THAT THEY I SHOULD HAVE TO TAKE INSOLEN IN ORDER TO REGULATE OTHERWISE THEIR BLOOD LUCOS CAN GO SO HIGH THAT IT CAN DAMAGE CELLS AND DAMAGE ORGANS TAT CAN EVEN KILL PEOPLE PEOPLE HAVE TY TOO DIOBETES ARE SO CALLED INSOLENT INSENSITIVE THEY MAKE INSOLENT BUT THE RECEPTERS TO INSOLENT ARE NOT SENSITIVE TO IT AND SO THEY MAKE MORE INSOLENT THAN NORMALLY WOULD BE MADE AND BLOOD LUCOSES ANT REGULATHEY PROPERLY ET CETERA ET CETERA THE TAKE COME MESSAGE ABOUT BLOOD GLUCOS IS THAT YOU WANT YOUR BLOOD LUCOS LEVELS TO GO UP WHEN YOU EAT BUT NOT TOO HIGHAND YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO SAY ELEVATED FOR TOO LONG THIS STUDY LOOKED AT HOW PEOPLE WHO ARE LARGELY SEDENTARY OR AT LY SITTING CAN INCREASE THE UTILIZATION THE CLEARANCE OF GLUCOS FROM THE BLOOD STREAM AFTER EATING AND THEY ALSO LOOKED AT OVER ALL METABOLISM FOR PEOPLE GET THIS THAT WE'RE USING JUST THAT ONE PERCENT OF MUSCLE THE SOLIUS BY DOING WHAT THEY CALL A SOLIEST PUSHUP SO THE SOLIEST PUSH UP CAN BE DESCRIBED VERY SIMPLY AS IF YOU'RE SITTING DOWN WITH YOUR KNEE BENT AT AN APPROXIMATELY RIGHT ANGLE I LIKE A SQUARE CORNER AND PUSHING UPRUSH ES A LIFTING YOUR HEEL WHILE PUSHING DOWN ON YOUR TO AND CONTRACTING THE CALF MUSCLE AS IT WERE AND THEN LOWERING THE HEEL AND THEN IN LIFTING THAT HEEL AGAIN LOWERING THE HEEL LIFTING THE HEEL AGAIN EACH ONE OF THOSE IS WHAT THEY CALL A SOLIS PUSHUP THIS STUDY HAD PEOPLE CONTINUOUSLY DU SOLIES PUSHUPS AND THEY LOOK AT THINGS LIKE BLOOD LUCOSUALIZATION THEY LOOKED AT METABOLISM AND SO ON NOW COUPLE OF IMPORTANT THNGS ABOUT THE STUDY BEFORE I TELL YOU WHAT THEY DISCOVERED WHICH WAS FRANKLY PRETTY MIRACULOUS ALMOST HARD TO BELIEVE AND YET I BELIEVE THE DATA THE DATO LOOK A TO BE COLLECTED QUITE A QUITE WELL AND THEY'RE LOT OF STATISTICS IN THE STUDY LOOKS TO BE QUITE THOROUGH FIRST OF ALL THEY USED AN EQUAL NUMBER OF MAL AND FEMALE SUBJECTS THERE WERE WIDE RANGE OF BODY MASS INDICEASE OCASE SO THIS WASN'T JUST SUPERFIT PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE THAT WERE PURELY SEDENTARY NOT FIT THEY USED A WIDE VARIETY OF AGES TIME OF DAY THUT PEOPLE WHO TENDED TO WALK A LOT OR NOT WALK A LOT THEY MEASURED CHANGES IN METABOLISM AND BLOOD GLUOS UTALIZATION IN PEOPLE THAT HAD DONE THESE SOLIEST PUSH UPS WALL SEATED IN THE LABORATORY AND I MUST SAY THEY HAD THEM DO THESE SOLES PUSH UPS ARE QUITE A LONG WHILE CONTINUOUSLY SO THEY HAVE THEM DO IT FOR AS LONG AS TOO HUNDRE ND SEVENTY MINUTES TOTAL THROUGHOUT THE DAY SO IF YOU DIVIDE THAT THAT'S FOUR AND A HALF HOURS YOU MIGHTSAY WHILE FOR AND HALF HOURS OF LIFTING THE HEEL AND PUTTING THE HEEL DOWN LIFTIN THE HEEL PUTTIN THE EEL DOWN THAT'S A LOT BUT THEY DIDN'T ALWAYS DO IT CONTINUOUSLY THAT HAD SOME BREAKS IN THERE SO THIS IS THE SORT OF THING THAT YOU COULD IMAGION YOU OR OTHER PEOPLE COULD DO WHILE SEATED WHILE DOING ZUMES OR A WHILE ON CALLS OR AVE EVEN WHILE EATING DOING THAT SORT OF THING ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU CONSTANTLY BE FOCUSSING ON SOLIUS PUSHUPS THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE THE POINT IS THAT PEOPLE WHO DID THESE SOLIEST PUSHOPS EXPERIENCED TROMMATIC IMPROVEMENTS IN BLOOD SUGAR REGULATION AND IN METABOLISM DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE SOLIUS IS JUST ONE PER CENT OF THE TOTAL MUSCULATURE SO HERE I 'M GOING TO READ FROM THE ABSTRACT ABOUT WHAT THEY FOUND PEOPLE WHO DID THESE SOLIES PUSHUPS DESPITE BEING A TINY MUSCLE AND USING VERY LITTLE LOCAL ENERGY IN FACT THEY MEASURED MUSCLE GLICOGEN THE BURN OR ESSENTIALLY THE THE UTILIZATION OF FUEL WITHIN THE MUSCLE AND THRE WAS VERY LITTLE UTILIZATION OF FUEL WITHIN THE SOLIUS ITSELF AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE SOLIUS HAS THIS UNIQUE PROPERTY OF NEEDING TO BASELY KEEP YOU GOING ALL DAY WALKING ALL DAY OR MOVING ALL DAY WHAT THEY SAW WAS A LARGE MAGNITUDE FOR EXAMPLE FIFTY TWO PER CENT LESS POST PRENDEAL THAT'S AFTER A MEAL GLUCOS EXCURSION SO FIFTY TWO PER CENT LESS INCREASE IN BLOOD GLUCOS AND SIXTY PER CENT SIXTY R O LESS HYPER INSOLENEMIA SO REDUCE LEVELS OF INSOLENT THEY ALSO MIRACULOUSLY OBSERVE THAT DESPITE THIS BEING AGAIN AT A SMALL MUSCLE ONE PER CENT OF THE TOTAL MUSCLE MASS SO VERY SMALL OXIDATIVE USE THEY SAW BIG IMPROVEMENTS IN SYSTEMIC METABOLIC REGULATION SO THIS IS INTERESTING I THINK SOMETHING THAT WE SOULD AT LEAST KNOW ABOUT I'M NOT AWARE THAT ANY ONE'S REPLICATED THE STUDY YET I KNOW THERE'S A TON OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE STUDY IN THE POPULAR PRESS AND IF THE DATA TURN OUT TO HOLD UP WHICH I LIKE TO IMAGINE THEY WILL I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THERE SO MUCH EXCITEMEN WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO CARES ABOUT BLOOD GLUCOS REGULATION YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR METABOLISM RUNNING PLEASE DON'T STOP EXERCISING THE OTHER WAYS THAT YOU EXERCISE BUT IF YOURE'S SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO MAXIMISE YOUR HEALTH DOING THESE SOLIES PUSHOPS FAIRLY CONTINUOUSLY WHILE SEATED IS GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL AND IN ADDITION TO THAT I KNOW THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO FORINCENCS MIGHT BE INJURED OR YOU'R TRAVELING IN YOUR STCK ON A PLAN OR YOU'RE IN THE CLASS ROOM AND YOUR FORCED TO STUDY ALL DAY OR TAKE NOTES ALL DAY YOU'E JUST NOT GETTING ENOUGH OPPORTUNITY TO GET THOSE STEPS THAT YOU WANT TO TAKE WHETHERE NOT'S TEN THOUSAND OR FEW R OR MORE GETTING ENOUGH STEPS OR MOVEMENT MAYBEYOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO GET OUT INDO YOUR RUN OR MAYBEUR ALSO RUNNING WEIGHT LIFTING AND DOING YOGO CLASSES AND THINGS OF THAT SORT BUT YOU WANT TO FURTHER IMPROVE YOUR FITNESS AT LEAST IN TERMS OF YOURE METABOLIC HEALTH THIS SEEMS LIKE A TERRIFIC VERY LOW INVESTMENT WAY TO DO IT CERTAINLY ZERO COST IT DOES TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF ATTENSION SO YOU AVE TO DIVERT YOUR ATTENTION FROM OTHER THINGS YOU'RE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'R STILL DOING THESE SOLIES PUSHUPS I'M SURE THAT MANY OF YOU OR CAN HAVE A LOT OF DETAILED QUESTIONS SUCH AS YOU KNOW HOW HIGH DID THEY LIFT THE HEEL L AND DID THEY CONTRACT THE MUSCLE VERY HARD OR NOT COUPLE OF THINGS ABOUT THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE SUBJECTS REALLY CONTRACT THE MUSCLE HARD THEY DID MEASURE THE ANGLE OF HEEL RAYS A MAN WHO WAS ANYWHERE FROM TEN TO FIFTEEN DEGREES SO YOU THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO GO WAYWAY UP ON THEIR TIPPITOES OR THINGS OF THAT SORT IN ANY EVENT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY MINUTES FOR AND A HALF HOURS OF DOING THESE A SOLIUS PUSH UPS IS A LOT BUT BY MY READ OF THE DATA AND THE RATHER SIGNIFICANT OR ISHES A VERY SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS THAT THEY OBSERVED ON BLOOD LUCOS REGULATION IN METABOLISM ET CETERA SEEMS TO ME THAT DOING LESS WOULD STILL BE BENEFICIAL AND THAT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO DO THE FULL TOO HUNDER IN SEVENTY MINUTES IN ORDER TO GET THE BENEFITS THAT THEY OBSERVED MORE ABOUT THES STUDY INCLUDES THE FACKT THAT THE BENEFITS THY OBSERVED WERE VERY LONG LASTING AS LONG AS TWO HOURS AFTER A MEAL THEY COULD STILL SEE THIS IMPROVE BLOOD LUCOSEALISATION I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE I WASN'T ABLE TO FIND IT IN THE METHODS WHETHER NOT THEY WERE DOING THE SOLIUS PUSH UPS WHILE THEY WERE CONSUMING AM BLOOD SUGAR IN THE STUDY THE POINT BEING THAT IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO CARES ABOUT THEIR FITNESS THIS STUDY IS INTERESTING BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT AGAIN IF YOU ARE FORCE TO BE I MOBILE OR SITTING LONGER THAN YOU WOULD LIKE FEEL STUCK IN A MEETING ORESUMES OR CLASS OR ON A PLANE ET CETERA OR IF YOURE SIMPLY TRYING TO ADD A BIT MORE FITNESS AND METABOLIC HEALTH TO YOUR OVERALL REGIMEN SOLIUS PUSHUPS LEAST TO ME SEEM LIKE A VERY LOW INVESTMENT SIMPLE ZERO COST TOOL TO IMPROVE YOUR METABOLIC HEALTH FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT WANT I PRODES THE STUDY A MORE DETAIL WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THIS PAPER PUBLISH INNY SCIENCE IN THE SHONOTE CAPTION BEFORE WE BEGIN ID LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS ET STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRON EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTOC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TODAY'S POD CAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR NOW SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLITES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOES AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLIKE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHOSITS IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACK TO ELECTOROLIKE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT'S ONE GRAHAM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDER MILEGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KINOPHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I AVE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENTE DOC COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENTS SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THATS DRINK ELEMENT EL EMENTE DOT COM SLASH HUBERMEN LET'S TALK ABOUT FITNESS AND LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN DEVELOP THE OPTIMAL FITNESS PROTOCALS FOR YOU THAT INCLUDES WHAT TO DO EACH DAY OF THE WEEK AND YOUR FITNESS PROTOCAL ACROSS THE WEEK AND INDEED ACROSS THE MONTH AND THE YEAR AND EVEN YEAR TO YEAR WHEN WE HAD DOCTOR ANDY GALOPING ON THE PODCAST HE SAID SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE WANT TO KEEP IN MIND TO DAY WHICH IS CONCEPTS ARE FEW METHODS ARE MANY THAT IS THERE ARE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND EXERCISEES AND SET IN REPT SCHEMES IN DIFFERENT RUNS AND PURPIES AND PUSHUPS ET CETERA ET CETERA THAT ONE CAN FOLLOW HOWEVER THERE ARE REALLY JUST A FEW BASIC CONCEPTS OR PRINCIPLES OF MUSCLE PHYSIOLOGY OF CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTION OF CONNECTIVE TISSUE FUNCTION THAT PROVIDE OR SET THE BASIS FOR THE ADAPTATIONS THAT WE CALL FITNESS OR THAT LEAD TO FITNESS SO CAN ELIST THOS OFF NOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT A FITNESS PROTOCAL THAT'S REALLY AIMED MAINLY TOWARD DEVELOPING SKILL THAT'S ONE OR SPEED THAT'S ANOTHER OR POWER WHICH IS SPEED TIME STRENGTH OR SPECIFICALLY STRENGTH OR HYPERTROPHY GROWTH OF MUSCLES OR ENDURANCE SUCH AS MUSCULAR ENDURANCE MUSCULAR ENDURANCE IS FOR INSTANCE UABILITY TO STAY IN A PLANK POSITION OR TO DO A WALL SIT YOU NOWE SIT ON AN INVISIBLE CHAIR AGAINST A WALL OR OTHER FORMS OF ENDURANCE LIKE NEAR PURE ANEROBIC ENDURANCE SO A ONE MINUTE SPRINT OR LESS OR ONE MINUTE ALL OUT CYCLING ON A STATIONARY BIKE THIS SORT OF THING OR ENDURANCE THAT OCCURS IN THE KIND OF THREE TO TWELVE MINUTE TOTAL DURATION RANGE SO THAT MIGHT BE SPRINTS OR HYH INTENTS THE INTERVAL TYPE TRAINING IT COULD BE A ALL OUT SWIM IT COULD BE ALL OUTROW THAT'S ANOTHER FORM OF ENDURANCE TAPS INTO DIFFERENT FUEL SYSTEMS DIFFEASPECTS OF MUSCLE PHYSIOLOGY ET CETERA AND THEN ENDURANCE THAT LAST THIRTY MINUTES ARE MORE WHICH IS TYPICALLY WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT ENDURANCE BUT OF COURSE THE OTHER FORMS OF ENDURANCE MATTER SO WE'VE GOT SKILL SPEED POWER STRENGTH HYPERTROPHY MUSCULAR ENDURANCE ANEROBIC ENDURANCE WHAT I WOULD CALL THREE TO TWELVE MINUTES INDURANCE ALTHOUGH IT GOES BY OTHER NAMES AS WELL AND THIRTY MINUTE OR MORE ENDURANCE TYPE EXERCISE AND ADAPTATIONS EACH IN EVERY ONE OF THESE REQUIRES DIFFERENT PRINCIPLES DIFFERENT CONCEPTS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE A YOUR MUSCULAR STRAINGT THROUGH YOUR HYPERTROPHY OR BOTH HOWEVER THERE'S A GENERAL THEME THAT SITS BENEATH ALL ADAPTATIONS LEADING TO FITNESS AND THAT'S WHAT WERE REALLY GOING TO SET DOWN AS THE BASE LAYER THE FOUNDATION OF EVERYTHING WE TALK ABOUT TO DAY AND THAT'S THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE MODIFIABLE VARIABLES AGAIN IM BORROWING DIRECTLY FROM THE EPISODE OF DOCTOR ANY YALPIN HE WAS THE ONE THAT SAID MODIFIABLE VARIABLES ARE THE KEY THING TO THING ABOUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO MODIFY WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO CHANGE IN ORDER TO INCREASE ONE OR SUM OF THE VARIOUS THINGS I LIST IT OFF BEFOR GILLSPEED POWER STRENGTH HYPERTROPHE ENDURANCE ET CETERA ET CETERA AND SOME OF THE KEY CONCEPTS THAT EMERGE FROM THAT DISCUSSION AR THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD NORMALLY WHEN PEOPLE HEREABOUT PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD THEY THINK ABOUT ADDING MORE WEIGHT TO A BAR PICKING UP HEAVIER DUMB BELLS BUT THAT COULD ALSO BE PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD IN THE CONTECTS OF RUNNING UP A HILL OF STEEPER INCLINE OR RUNNING A LTTA BIT FASTER A LITTLE BIT FURTHER AND SO ON AND SO FORTH NOW AS I PROMISED EARLIER TO DAY WE ARE NOT GOING TO DRILL INTO EACH IN EVERY ONE OF THE MECHANISMS THAT UNDERLIE THE DIFFERENT ADAPTATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO DEVELOP SPEED AND STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE ET CETERA BECAUSE THAT WAS COVERED IN THE PODCAST WITH DOCTOR ANY GALOPIN AND THE OTHER PODCASTS WITH EXPERTS THAT I MENTION EARLIER AND WE AGAIN WILL PROVIDE LINKS TO THOSE PODCASTS IF YOU WANT TO DRILL INTO THOSE MECHANISMS INSTEAD WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO START WITH A PROGRAME THAT ESSENTIALLY IS DESIGNED FOR YOU TO MAXIMISE ALL ASPECTS OF FITNESS TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY MAXIMIZE LL ASPECTS OF FITNESS BUT THEN TO CHANGE OR MODIFY THAT PROTOCOL SO THAT IF YOU WANT TO BUILD UP MORE FOR INSTANCE STRENGTH THAN YOU WANTO JUST HOLD ON TO THE ENDURANCE YOU HAVE YOU DON'T WANT TO BUILD ENDURANCE AT LEAST NOT IN THAT WEAKER THAT MONTH YOU CAN DO THAT OR IF YOU WANT IMPROVE YOUR ENDURANCE WHILE MAINTAINING YOUR STRENGTH YOU CAN DO THAT AND SO ON AND SO FORTH MOST PEOPLE I DO BELIEVE WOULD LIKE A COMMINATION OF STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE AND FLEXIBILITY AND MAYBE EVEN HYPERTROPHE PARTICULARLY FOR CERTAIN MUSCLE GROUPS THAT MAY BE ARE NOT AS WELL DEVELOPED AS OTHER MUSCLE GROUPS THEY WANT TO BRING BALANCE TO THEIR PHYSIQUE BOTH FOR SAKE OF AESTHETICS AND FOR SAKE OF HEALTH AND FORSAKE OF NO GENERAL FUNCTIONING MAYBE VENTO ELIMINATE PAIN THE PROTOCOL THAT I'M GOING TO DESCRIBE REALLY WORKS AS A FOUNDATIONAL TEMPLET FOR THAT IS WELL SO LET'S DRILL INTO THAT FOUNDATIONAL PROTOCOL AND I'LL KEEP REFERRING TO IT AS THE FOUNDATIONAL PROTOCOL NOT BECAUSE IT'S THE ONE THAT I USE ALTHOUGH IT IS THE ONE THAT I USE IN NOT BECAUSE IT'S HE ONE THA WERE TALKING ABOUT TO DAY ALTHOUGH IT' THE OEWERE TALKING ABOUT TO DAY BUT BECAUSE WE NEED SOME GENERAL FRAME WORK FROM WHICH TO BUILD OUT THE MORE SPECIFIC PROTOCOLS THAT WILL GET INTO IN A BIT MORE DETAIL LATER SO IN THIS FOUNDATIONAL PROTOCOL FOR FITNESS WHAT YOU'LL NOTICE IS THAT ON ANY ONE GIVEN DAY YOU'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON ONE PARTICULAR ASPECT OF FITNESS MAYBE IT'S ENDURANCE MAY BE ITS STRENGTH MAY BE ITS HYPERTROPHE IN PARTICULAR IT MIGHT BE HYPERTROPHY FOR PARTICULAR MUSCLE GROUP OR MUSCLE GROUPS THAT SAID ACROSS THE ENTIRE WEEK IT'S DESIGN TO BRING FITNESS AND DIFFERENT FORMS OF FITNESS TO ALL ASPECTS OF YOUR BODY SO THIS PARTICULAR PROTOCOL BEGINS ON SUNDAY ALTHOUGH THAT'S SIMPLY THE DAY THAT I HAPPEN TO BEGIN THE PROTOCOL AND AGAIND THIS PROTOCOL IS NOT IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S THE ONE THAT I FOLLOW I FOLLOW IT BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT IN OTHER WORDS IT'S A PROTCOL THATS REALLY GLEAN FROM THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AND THE EXPERTS THAT IS FOR U SO THITS FITNESS PROTOCOLS REALY ABOUT YOU I JUST MAY REFER TO IT AS THE ONE THAT I FOLLOW I'M SIMPLY FOR EASE OF COMMUNICATION AND FOR ME MY WEEK BEGINS ON SUNDAY SO I DO MY VERY BEST TO GET A WORK OUT IN ON SUNDAY AND FOR ME THAT WORK OUT IS THAT OF A ENDURANCE WORK OUT IT'S DESIGN TO EITHER MAINTAIN OR INCREASE MY ENDURANCE AND THE ENDURANCE TYPE THAT I'M REFERRING TO IS ENDURANCE OF THIRTY MINUTES OR MORE IN FACT FOR ME THE GOAL IS ALWAYS TO GET EITHER SIXTY TO SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES OF JOGGING  SO THIS WOULD BE SO CALLED ZONE TO CARDIO PEOPLE PROBABLY HAVE HEARD OF ZONE TOO CARDIO BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T THAT SOCET ZONE TO CARDIO SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD MEASURE WITH A HEART RATE MONITOR OR OTHER DEVICE BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO ZONE TOO CARDIO IS THE KIND OF CARDY OF ASCULAR EXERCISE IN WHICH YOU'RE PUSHING YOURSELF TO MOVE SUCH THAT YOUR BREATHING FASTER THAN NORMAL YOUR HEART IS BEATING FASTER THAN NORMAL HOWEVER YOU ARE STILL ABLE TO SUSTAIN A CONVERSATION BUT IF YOU WERE TO PUSH YOURSELF ANY HARDER THAT IS MOVE FASTER OR GO UP A STEEPER INCLINE AT THE SAME RATE YOU HAPPEN TO BE AT ANY ONE MOMENT YOU WOULD LOSE THAT ABILITY TO SPEAK YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COMPLETE SENTENCE AS YOU WOULD BE OUT OF BREATH YOU'D HAVE TO PAUSE MID SENTENCE NOW IT'S NEAR IMPOSSIBLEL EVEN WITH A HEART RATE MONITOR TO STAY EXACTLY IN ZONE TO UNLESS YOU'RE VERY VERY SKILLED AT THAT SO I DON'T OBSESS OVER THAT AND IN FACT I DON'T WEAR A HEART RATE MONITOR WHEN I DO THIS EXERCISE BUT FOR ME THE GOAL IS TO HEAD OUT ON SUNDAY AND GET SIXTY TO SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES OF JOGGING IN ZONE TO NOW OF COURSE I LIKE TO JOG WIT THAT DOES IT MEAN THAT YOU HAVE TO JOG YOU COULD REPLACE JOGGING WITH ROWING ON A ROWING MACHINE OR MAY BE EVEN ROWING AN ACTUAL BOAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THAT OR CYCLING OR SWIMMING SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS YOU CONTINUOUS MOVEMENT FOR SIXTY TO SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES AT THAT ZONE TO THRESHOLD WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER FOR ME THAT CAN INCLUDE SOME HILLS AND WHEN I SAY HILLS THAY COULD BE VERY STEEP HILLS BUT I'LL SIMPLY SLOW MY PACE DOWN IN ORDER TO STAY IN THAT ROUGHLY ZONE TO RANGE OR IT COULD BE THAT THEY ARE OR LOW GRATE HILLS AND I MIGHT YOUN JUST SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT OR I MIGHT EVEN PUSH MYSELF A TINY BIT THAT DAY BUT REALLY I'M JUST TRYING TO BUILD THAT LONG ENDURANCE I'M TRYING TO BUILD UP MY CAPACITY OR MAINTAIN MY CAPACITY TO GO A LONG DISTANCE WITHOUT FATIGUING NOW SOME DAYS MEANING SOME SUNDAYS SINCE I TEND TO DO THIS ALMOST ALWAYS ON SUNDAY ALTHOUGH THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS INSTEAD OF DOING THE SIXTY TO SEVENTY FIVE MINUTE JOG WHAT I'LL DO IS I WILL HEAD OUT FOR A LONG HEIGHT THAT COULD BE TWO AND A HALF HOURS OR THREE HOURS OR MAY BE EVEN A FOUR OR FIVE HOUR HIKE SOMETIMES IT'S VERY LONG AND I'LL DO THAT SOMETIMES SIMPLY TO MIX UP THE ROUTINE BECAUSE SOMETIMES JOGGING AND JOGGING THE SAME ROUTES GETS BORING TO ME I DO ENJOY RUNNING THAT SOMETHINGHIVE BEEN DOING FOR A VERY LONG TIME BUT SOMETIMES IT JUST GETS A LITTLE BIT UM TEDIOUS AND I WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT ALSO SOMETIMES I WANT TO BE SOCIAL ON SUNDAYS I WANT A HEAD OUT ON A HIKE WITH MY PARTNER OR I WANT TO MEET UP WITH FRIENDS AND HIKE WITH THEM AND SO TAKING A LONG HIKHE ON SUNDAY AS SOMETHING THAT ALSO COL BE QUITE SOCIAL AND THEN I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ALSO GETTING IN MY WORK OUT WHEN HEADING OUT ON A HEIKE WITH MY PARTNER OR GOING OUT TO MEET WITH FRIENDS OR THINGS OF THAT SORT I WILL SAY THAT THERE'S A SPECIFIC TOOL OR A SPECIFIC CHANGE THAT YOU CAN MAKE TO THIS SUNDAY LONG ENDURANCE OR AT LEAST WHAT I CONSIDER LONG FOR ME AN IT'S BY NO MEANS A MARITHON OR AN IRONMAN BUT UM THIS LONG ENDURANCE TRAINING AND THAT'S THE USE OF A WEIGHT VEST SO SOMETHING THAT I'VE REALLY START YULIZING MORE RECENTLY AND BY MORE RECENTLY I REALLY MEAN WITHIN THE LAST YEAR OR SO IS I PURCHASED ONE OF THESE WEIGHT VESTS THAT UM CAN BE ANYWHERE FROM TEN TO FIFTY POUNDS WHAT I USE IN THEWEIGHT VEST IS IS IRRELEVANT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY CHANGES THE LEVEL OF EFFORT REQUIRED WHEN TAKING A HIKE OR EVEN A WALK NOW THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT OF THE WEIGHT VEST WHICH IS THAT IF YOU ARE GOING OUT FOR A HIKE OR EVEN FOR A WALK FOR SOCIAL REASONS AND YOU'RE WITH SOMEBODY THAT'S NOT QUITE AT THE SAME FITNESS LEVEL THAT YOU ARE FRANKLY IT'SILLIBAT RUDE TO JIS WALKING AHEAD OF THEM AND RUNNING BACK OR RUNNING AHEAD AND RUNNING BACK YOU OFTENTIMES YOU REALLY WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH THE PERSON AND YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO FEEL AS IF THEY'RE HOLDING YOU UP AND SO THE WEIGHT VEST IS A TERRIFIC WAY TO GET SOME ADDITIONAL WORK AND AS YOU'LL FIND IF YOU WEAR A WEIGHT VEST IT IS ADDITIONAL WORK ON SAY A SHORTER HEIKE SO MAY BE THE PERSON YOU'RE WITH ONLY HAS TIME FOR AN HOUR LONG HIKE OR MAY BE THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE FITNESS TO DO A TWO HOUR OR THREE HOUR HIGKE SO I'LL THROW ON THE WEIGHT VEST AND I'LL HEAD OUT FOR A WALK WITH THEM OR A HEIKE WITH THEM OR SOMETIMES I'LL GO OUT ON A LONG HEIKE WITH THE WIGHT VEST MYSELF SO AGAIN THE POINT OF THIS FOR ME SUNDAY ALTHOUGH IT COULD FALL ON ANY DAY FOR YOU WORK OUT IS REALLY TO BUILD UP THAT LONG FORM EN DURANCE AND THIS FITS WELL WITH WHAT DOCTOR ANDTY GALPIN AND DOCTOR PETEROTIO REFERRED TO AS THE REAL NEED TO GET IN SOME LONG ENDURANCE TYPE WORK AT SOME POINT OR EVEN MULTIBLE POINTS THROUGHOUT THE WEEK FOR ME THIS LONG SUNDAY JOG OF SIXTY TO SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES OR LONG SUNDAY HEIKE OR WEIGHTED WALK OR WEIGHTED HIKE REALLY ACCOMPLISHES THAT GOAL SOMETIMES LEADS TO A LITTLE BIT OF SORENESS I'M PARARTICULARLY MY CALVES OR IF I'M WEARING THE WEIGHT VEST SOMETIMES MY MY MIDSECTION IL GET SORE BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO REMAIN UPRIGHT SO I THINK IT ALSO BUILDS UP SOME MUSCULAR ENDURANCE NOT JUST CARTY OF ASCULAR ENDURANCE BUT AGAIN THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE TIME THAT I'M JOGGING OR HEIKING WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO IS A PLACE WHERE I CAN FEEL THAT MY PULSERATE IS DEFINITELY ELEVATED BUT IT'S NOT SO ELEVATED THAT HAVE TO STOP BECAUSE I'M OUT OF BREATH AND BECAUSE I KNOW SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE MIGHT BE REALLY NAURODIC ABOUT THIS SORT OF THING IF YOU HAVE TO STOP BECAUSE YOU'RE OUT OF BREATH THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU BLEW THE WORK OUT THAT YOU KNOW AREN'T GETTING ENDURANCE OF COURSE YOU'RE GETTING BENEFITS FROM IT SO I'M NOT ABSOLUTELY NAURDIC ABOUT ALWAYS STAYING EXACTLY IN THAT HEART RATE ZOWN I MIGHT STOP AND HAVE A CONVERSATION FOR A MOMENT IF IT'S A LONGER HEIGKE ALTHOUGH I REALLY TRYIND KEEP MOVING AND I TRY ING PUSH MYSELF JUST A LITTLE BIT FURTHER THAN WERE I'M EXCEEDINGLY COMFORTABLE AND SO FOR ME DOING THIS LONG SUNDAY HEIKE OR JOG REALLY PROVIDES A FOUNDATIO N A BASE FOR ENDURANCE THAT THEN THE OTHER ENDURANCE WORK OUTS THAT I'LL DESCRIBE LATER AND THAT TAKE PLACE LATER IN THE WEEK CAN BUILD ON AS I MENTION EARLIER WE WILL GET BACK TO THE MECHANISMS THAT THIS TAPS INTO AND WY THIS IS SO USEFUL THERE ARE MULTIBLE BENEFITS TO DOING THESE KINDS OF ENDURANCE TYPE WORK OUTS AND ZONE TOO CARDIO BUT BY PUTTING IT AT THE START OF MY WEEK AGAIN MY WEEK STARTS ON SUNDAY I'M SURE THAT REGARDLESS OF HOW THE REST OF THE WEAK GOES THAT I GOT MY ENDURANCE TRAINING IN AND OF COURSE I'M GOING TO WANT TO AND I WILL DO INDURANCE TRAINING OTHER DAYS DURING THE WEEK BUT IF SOMETHING COMES UP OR I HAPPEN TO GET SICK OR I'M REALLY BEHIND INTERMS OF WORK AND I CAN'T GET O THE WORK OUTS IN THIS SUNDAY LONG JOG OR HIKE REALLY PROVIDES THAT FUNDAMENTAL I CAN ON SEY SAY FOUNDATION FOR CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS AND ENDURANCE THAT I CAN HANG MY HAT ON AND SAY O KA I'VE GOT THAT ONE IN THE BAG AND I CAN THEN LOOK TO OTHER DAYS OF THE WEEK TO FOCUS ON OTHER ASPECTS OF FITNESS NOW REALLY IMPORTANT POINT TO MAKE ABOUT THIS SUNDAY EN DURANCE WORK OUT IS THAT A LOWS YOU TO CHECK OFF A BOX AND THAT BOX IS SEVENTY FIVE OR SO MINUTES OF ZONE TOO CARDIO BECAUSE AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD EITHER IN THIS PODCASS OR FROM OTHERS OUT THERE LIKE DOCTOR PETER ATAT GETTING A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TO TWO HUNDRED MINUTES OF ZONE TOO CARDIO PER WEEK HAS ENORMOUS POSIVE EFFECTS ON LONGEVITY AND ENORMOUS POSIVE EFFECTS ON GENERAL HEALTH AGAIN IN TERMS OF CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTION BOULD ALSO MET A BOLIC FUEL UTILIZATION ALSO IN TERMS OF YOUR MUSCULATURE AND YOU'RE ABILITY TO USE YOUR BODY OVER LONG DISTANCES FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME SO WHILE IT DOESN'T COMPLETE ALL ONE HUNDRED AN EIGHTY TO TWO HUNDREDMINUTES PER WEEK IT CERTAINLY GETS YOU A GOOD DISTANCE PONINTENDED TOWARD THAT GOAL NOW I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE STARTING IF ITNESS PROGRAM AND SO SIXTY TO SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES OF JOGGING MIGHT BE TOO LONG OR A THREE HOUR WAITED VESTED HIKE OR SOME PEOPLE MIGHT EVEN DO WHAT'S ALLED A ROCK LIKE YOU WERE A RUCKSACK THAT MIGHT BE TOO MUCH IN WHICH CASE CERTAINLY START WITH LESS AND GO ON FLAT GROUND AND GO AT THE RATE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO GET INTO ZONE TO BUT THAT IS NOT EXCESSIVELY DIFFICULT FOR YOU AND THEN AS YOU BUILD UP FITNESS YOU CAN ADD TIME OR YOU CAN ADD WEIGHT THROUGH A WEIGHT VEST OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BUY A WEIGHT VEST OR CAN'T AFFORD ONE IS A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO THAT I SHOW A GOOD ANECDOTE ABOUT THAT ONE TIME I WAS AM HENTING OUT FOR A HEIKE WITH A FREND O MINE HE WAS FORMER SEALTEAME OPERATOR I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS AND HE SAID O YET I'LL BRING YOU A I'LL BRING YOU A SACK AND I THOUGHT YOU MEANT LIKE A SACK LUNCH LIKE YOU WAS GOINGTO BRING LUNCH AND I SHOWED UP AN HY BUSY GIV ME A BACKPACK THAT WAS LOADED WITH A BUNCH OF STUFF AND THE BACKPACK WEIGHT ABOUT FORTY POUNDS AND THEN WE TOOK A HIKE SO A I WAS THINKING LUNCH HE WAS THINKING WEIGHTED BACKPACK AND A WEITED BACKPACK OR EVEN JUST ANY KIND OF STRONG SACK THAT YOU CAN PUT OVER YOUR SHOULDERS OR EVEN CARRYING YOUR ARMS IT'S GOING TO WORK EXCEEDINGLY WELL TO BUILD IN SOME EXTRA REQUIREMENT FOR EFFORT SO YOU CERTAINLY DON'T HALF TO PURCHAS A WEIGHT VEST IN ORDER TO A IN ORDER TO GET THE BENEFITS OF BRINGING ADDITIONAL WEIGHT ALONG WITH YOU ON THESE LONG CARTY OF ASCULAR EVENTS BUT AGAIN BUILD UP OVER TIME YOU CAN ADD TIME YOU CAN ADD WEIGHT AND THAT'S ALSO A REALLY NICE FEATURE OF ADDING WEIGHT WHICH IS AT SOME POINT YOUR SCHEDUL MIGHT BE SUCH OR YOU JUST DON'T REALLY WANT TO KEEP ADDING MORE AND MORE AND MORE TIME ON THIS LONG ENDURANCE SUNDAY IN THIS CASE WORK OUT IN THAT CASE ADD WEIGHT YOU CAN ALSO AS YOU BUILD UP FITNESSYOU CAN ADD SPEED TO IT YOUR ZONE TO AND WHAT ZONE TOO IS WON'T SHIFT BUT WHAT WORK IS REQUIRED FROM YOU IN ORDER TO GET INTO ZONE TO WILL SHIFT THAT IS AS YOU GET MORE AND MORE FIT YOU'LL HAVE TO MOVE FASTER AND OR BRING MORE WEIGHT IN ORDER TO STAY IN ZONE TO AND THAT WILL SIMPLY TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE INDEED IMPROVING YOUR ENDURANCE O CASESO THEN MONDAY ROLLS AROUND AND I LIKE MOST EVERYONE ELSE OUT THERE I WORK ON MONDAY I GET RIGHT INTO MY EMALS AND PREPARATION FOR POD CAVS AND RUNNING MY LABORATORY ET CETERA HOWEVER I MAKE SURE THAT AT SOME POINT ON MONDAY AND FOR ME THAT SOME POINT IS TYPICALLY AND IDEALLY EARLY IN THE MORNING SO SEVEN A M OR SO I TRAIN MY LEGS ON MONDAY SO THAT INCLUDES QUADERSEPS HAMSTRINGS AND CALVS WHY DO I DO THAT WORK OUT ON MONDAY AND WHAT IS THAT WORK OUT DESIGN TO DO WILL THAT WORK OUT IS REALLY DESIGNED TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M EITHER MAINTAINING OR BUILDING STRENGTH IN MY LEGS AND THIS IS NOT SIMPLY FOR ESTHETIC REASONS THIS IS NOT SIMPLY TO GROW BIGGER CALVES OR GROW BRIGGER QUADRCEPS AND HAMSTRINGS ALTHOUGH IT CAN' ACCOMPLISH THAT AS WELL DEPENDING ON HOW YOU TRAIN WILL TALK ABOUT DETAILS OF TRAINING THE REASON FOR TRAINING LEGS ON MONDAY IS SEVERAL FULD FIRST OF ALL THEY ARE THE LARGEST MUSCL GROUPS OF THE BODY AND BY TRAINING YOUR LEGS ON MONDAY IT SETS IN MOTION A LARGE NUMBER OF METABOLIC PROCESSES THAT CARRY YOU SOME DISTANCE EVEN THROUGH THE WHOLE WEEK IN TERMS OF ELEVATING METABOLISM IN TERMS OF AMPLIFYING CERTAIN HORMONAL EVENTS IN YOUR BODY ET CETERA THAT ARE REALLY BENEFICIAL IN ADDITION TO THAT I'M OF THE BELIEF THAT THE LEGS ARE THE FOUNDATION OF THE BODY AND PROVIDED YOU CAN TRAIN LEGS SAFELY THAT TRAINING LEGS IS VITALLY IMPORTANT NOT JUST FOR STRENGTH OF THE LEGS BUT ALSO FOR STRENGTH OF YOUR INTIRE BODY AGAINS SOME OF THAT IS THROUGH SYSTEMAC HORMONAL EFFECTS BECAUSE IF YOURE GOING TO TRAIN THE LARGE MUSCLE GROUPS OF YOUR BODY UNDER SUBSTANTIAL LOADS YOU WILL GET SYSTEMAC RELEASE OF HORMONES NOT JUST TESTOSTRONE ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY TESTOSTRONE BUT ALSO THINGS LIKE GROWTH HORMONE YOU GET INCREASES IN ALL SORTS OF SO CALLED ANABOLIC HORMONES THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHOSE NOT TRYING TO INCREASE MUSCLE SIZE BECAUSE I REALIZE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOT TRYING TO DO THAT THESE ARE HORMONES THAT SHIFT YOUR METABOLISM AND YOUR OVER ALL TENDEN STRENGTH AND LIGAMENT STRENGTH AND OVER ALL MUSCULATURE INTO WHAT I WOULD CALL A STRONG FOUNDATION SO FOR ME MONDAY IS LEG WORK OUT IT ALSO JUST FEELS GOOD TO GET THE LEG WORK OUT OUT OF THE WAY EARLIER IN THE WEEK AND IT ACCOMPLISHES ANOTHER GOAL WHICH IS THAT I SOMETIMES WILL TAKE ONE OR TWO DAYS OFF OF A LEG WORK OUT BECAUSE THEY CAN BE VERY INTENSE AND THEY ARE LARGE MUSCELE GROUPS AND ILL EXPLAIN WHAT I DO ON THE OFF DAYS THER RE NOT PURE OFFDAYS THEY ACTUALLY INCLUDE SOME RECOVEREE TYPE TRAINING OR EVEN SOME ALL OUT TRAINING BUT MY TRAINING LEGS ON MONDAY I'M ABLE TO GET WHAT I CONSIDER THE HARDEST STRENGTH AND HYBERTROVY WORK OUT OUT OF THE WAY AND AGAIN SET ALL THOSE POSITIVE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS IN MOTION FOR THE ENTIRE WEEK THE OTHER THING IS THAT NO WORK OUT EXISTS IN ISOLATION WHAT YOU DO ONE DAY IS GOING TO BE DETERMINED BY WHAT YOU DID THE PREVIOUS DAY AND EVEN THOUGH THE PREVIOUS DAY I MAY HAVE TAKEN A THREE HOUR WEIGHT VESTED HIGHT NEVER ARE MY LEGS SO SORE FROM THAT LONG SLOW ENDURANCE WORK BECAUSE IT IS LONG AND SLOW THAT I'M UNABLE TO TRAIN LEGS CONTRAST THAT WITH A SAY HIGH INTENSA INTERVAL TRAINING WORK OUT WHICH COMES LATER IN THE WEEK AND MY LEGS MIGHT BE SORE IN FACT THEY MAGHT NOT EVEN BE RECOVERED SUCH THAT I'M ABLE TO DO A REAL LEG WORK AND MI SAVE REAL WORK OUT I'LL DESCRIBE WHAT IT THAT MEANS IN A MOMENT SO LEGS COME ON MONDAY AND I THINK THAT FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE USING OR INTERESTED IN USING RESISTANCE TRAINING I SUGGEST GETTING YOUR LEG WORK OUT DONE EARLY IN THE WEEK AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE HEARD THE O THE PHRASE YOU KNOW I'M DON'T SKIP LEG DAY IM I WILL GO A STEP FURTHERENCE A DON'T SKIP LIKDAY IN F IN FACT MAKE LEG DAY YOUR FIRST DAY OF STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPRY TRAINING PUT IT ON MONDAY I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ITHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED A G ONE IS A VITEM IN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEENS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AN TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THEREASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO BEN THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GOT IS VERY IMPORTANT ITS POPULATED BY GOT MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE IMMUN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIOTICS ANATHLETIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLETIC GRENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTEDINS VIEMENTS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTE GRIPT IF YOU LIKE TO TRYATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN SDOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD IN THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEARS SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THRE K TOO AGAIND THAT'S THATHLETIC GREEN SDOK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FRE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEARS SUPPLY O VITEM IN D THREE K TO O CASE ANOW THAR WERE TALKING ABOUT RESISTANCE TRAINING THE QUESTION IS GOING TO COME UP ABOUT SETS IN RAPS IN ALL OF THAT BUSINESS THAT WAS COVERED IN A LOT OF DETAIL ON THE PODCASTS WITH DOCTOR ANDY GALOPIN AND I'M GOING TO GET INTO SOME OF THAT DETAIL NOW BUT I'M  GOING TO WAIT UNTIL I DESCRIBE THE ENTIRE SET OF WORK OUTS FOR THE WEEK BEFORE I GO INTO EVEN MORE DETAIL BECAUSE THERE'S A WAY OF WHAT'S CALLED PERIODIZING THAT IS CHANGING THE SETS AND RAPS ET CETERA ACROSS THE WEEK AND INDEED FROM MONTH TO MONTH THAT'S REALLY OPTIMAL BUT I DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT SEEM AS IF ALL OF THAT JUST PERTAINS TO THE LEG WORK OUT IT ACTUALLY PRETAINS TO ALL OF THE RESISTANCE TRAINING SO I'LL JUST GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF TEESERS ABOUT THE KEY PRINCIPLES OF RESISTANCE TRAINING THAT I THINK ARE ALMOST UNIVERSALLY IF NOT UNIVERSALLY THEN GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE STRENGTH TRAINING IND PHYSIOLOGY COMMUNITY AND THEN LATER I'LL GET BACK TO SOME OF THE OVERARCHING PRINCIPLES THAT APPLY TO ALL STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHE WORK OUTS ACROSS THE WEEK INCLUING THE ONES FOR THE TORSO THE ARMS ET CETERA O KAY SO LEGS FALL ON MONDAY I SHOULD SAY THAT LEG WORK OUTS LIKE ALL RESISTANCE TRAINING WORK OUTS FOR ME CONSIST OF ABOUT AGAIN I'M NOT NAURADICALLY ATTACH THIS BUT ABOUT TEN MINUTES OF WARMING UP AND THEN ABOUT FIFTY FIVE ZERO TO SIXTY MINUTES OF REAL WORK NOW OF COURSE SOME OF THAT IS GOING TO BE REST BETWEEN SETS BUT BY REAL WORK I MEAN REALLY HARD WORK NOT NECESSARILY TO FAILURE WILL TALK ABOUT FAILURE IN AA BIT BUT HARD WORK WHERE I'M STRUGGLING TO COMPLETE THE FINAL REPETITIONS IF NOT GOING TO TO FAILURE TO O CONTINUE TO MOVE THEWIGHT REPETITIONS AND AGAIN THE ENTIRE WORK PORTION OF THAT WORK OUT IS ABOUT FIFTY TO SIXTY MINUTES WHY WELL PASS SIXTY MINUTES YOU STRIK ETTING INCREASES IN CARTES ALL THAT REALLY IMPEDE RECOVERY AND I PERSONALLY IN SOMEBODY THAT DOES NOT RECOVER VERY WELL FROM HIGH INTENSITY EXERCISE I REALIZE THAT WITHIN THE LITERATURE IT IS BELIEVED AND I THINK GENERALLY ACCEPTED THAT WHEN YOU STIMULATE MUSCLE HYPERTROPHY OUR STRENGTH INCREASES IT IMPACTS THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IT ALSO CAUSES THINGS LIKE PROATING SYNTHESIS ET CETERA THEIR NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FORMS OF ADAPTATION THAT OCCUR TO GIVE YOU MUSCLE STRENGTH IN SIZE CHANGES AND THESE DAYS PEOPLE TALK A LOT ABOUT NEEDING TO STIMULATE MUSCLE GROWTH OR MUSCLESTRENTH AT LEAST EVERY FORTY EIGHT HOURS BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT I RECOVER OUT THEIR SLOWLY AND I BENEFIT FROM WORKING THE SAME MUSCLE GROUP ABOUT TWICE PER WEEK WITH LONGER WHER I SHOULD SAY MORE DAYS OF REST IN BETWEEN THOSE WORK OUTS SO IF I TRAIN LEGS ON MONDAY BELIEVE IT OR NOT I'M ONLY TRAINING LEGS ON MONDAY I DO NOT HAVE A SECOND LEG WORK OUT DURING THE WEEK HOWEVER ON FRIDAY I DO A HIGH INTENSY INTERVAL TRAINING SESSION THAT SERVES TWO PURPOSES ONE IS IT SERVES THE PURPOSE OF TRIGGERING A CERTAIN TYPE OF ENDURANCE AND GETTING MY HEART RAT VERY VERY HIGH AND IN ADDITION TO THAT BECAUSE OF THE WAY I DO THAT WORK OUT IT ACTS AS A SORT OF SUPPLEMENT OR A MORE MODERATE INTENSITY WORK OUT FOR QUADRCEPS HAMSTRAINGS AN CALVES SUCH THAT I AT LEAST NEVER LOSE STRENGTH IN FACT GENERALLY BUILD STRENGTH FROM ONE LEG WORK OUT TO THE NEXT PROVIDED I'M DOING THINGS CORRECTLY SO WHAT I'M NOT REFERRING TO IS A KIND OF CLASSIC A YOU KNOW SUPERHIGH INTENSITY TRAINING ONCE PER WEEK AND THEN NOT ACTUALLY TRAINING THAT MUSCLE GROUP AGAIN FOR ME IT'S REALLY TRAI ING EACH MUSCLE GROUP TWICE PER WEEK ONCE DIRECTLY AND THEN ONCE INDIRECTLY EITHER DURING ANOTHER WEIGHT TRAINING WORK OUT OR DURING A CARTY OF ASCULAR I SHOULD SAY IN DURANT STRAINING WORK OUT SO AGAIN LEGS ON MONDAY THE WORK OUT IS FIFTY TO SIXTY MINUTES AFTER A BRIEF WARM UP I GENERALLY PICK TWO EXERCISES PER MUSCLE GROUPS AGAIN I'M DOING CALVES I'M DOING QUADERCEPS AND I'M DOING HAMSTRINGS YOU SHOULD PICK THE EXERCISES THAT WORK FOR YOU SO THAT'S WHY AM ACTALLY NOT GOING TO SHARE WHICH EXERCISES I USE I'LL GIVE YOU A A COUPLE SUGGESTIONS ABOUT THE ONES I DO USE BUT REALLY EXERCISE SELECTION AS DOCTOR ANDY GALOPAN POINTED OUT IS A VERY IMPORTANT VARIABLE AND THE KEY THING TO EMPHACISE FOR THAT VARIABLES THAT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM THE MOVEMENT SAFELY SI KNOW THERE THE HUGE DEBATE OUT THERE AND PEOPLE LOVE TO ARGUE ABOUT WHETHER NOT ONE CAN SQUAT OR DEAD LIFT FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME OR SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT SOME POPLE SAY YO ABSOLUSHOULD I PERSONALLY DO NOT SQUAT AND DO NOT DEAD LIFT I'VE ACTILN NEVER DONE MUC SQUATTING OR DEAD LIFTING AND I KNOW SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE PROUABLY ROLLING THEIR EYES OR SWITCHING THE CHANNEL AT THIS POINT A BUT I CAN SAY THAT FOR ME I'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE STRENGTH AND HIGH PERCHUREFEE GOALS THAT I'VE BEEN SEEKING DOING THING SLIKE LEG EXTENSIONS AND HACK SQUATS OR FOR HAMSTRINGS DROINGTHINGS LIKE LEG CURLS AND GLUTE HAMRASES OR FOR CALVES DOING STANDING AND SEETED CALFRASES AND SO ON I THINK A KEY PRINCIPLE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO IS ONE THAT WAS TAUGHT TO ME BY A EXCELLENT STRENGTH COACH YEARS AGO AND I STILL USE THES AND AT LEAST AT WORKS FOR ME FOR EACH MUSCELE GROUP TRY AND FIND AN EXERCISE IN WHICH YOU GET THAT MUSCLE INTO A WEIGHTED STRETCH POSITION SO THIS WOULD BE FOR INSTANCE THE STANDING CALFRASE YOU OT DOWN AT THE BOTTOM ITS WEIGHTED AND YOU'RE IN IT IN A DEEP STRETCH PROVIDED YOU'RE DOING THE ON THE MOVEMENT CORRECTLY AS WELL AS ANOTHER EXERCISE WHERE YOU'RE GETTING CONTRACTION IN THE SHORTENED POSITION OF THE MUSCLE SO FOR THE HAMSTRINGS THAT WOULD BE THE LEG CURL FOR A THE CALVES IT WOULD BE A SEETED CALFRAS OR FOR THE QUADRUCEPS THE A THE LEG EXTENSION IS  IF THE MACHINE IS DESIGN RIGHT AND YOU'RE DOING IT CORRECTLY THE PEA CONTRACTION IS LARGELY GOING TO OCCUR AT THE AT THE LEGS EXTENDED POSITION BUT THEN ANOTHER EXERCISE FOR EACH MUSCLE GROUP THAT PUTS THE MUSCLEING TO MORE OF US STRETCHED OR AT LEAST A LARGER RANGE OF MOTION OR COMPOUND TIGHT MOVEMENT BUT IDEALLY WHERE THERE SOME STRETCH THERE SO I GUESS I WILL TELL YOU WHAT EXERCISE I EXERCISE I DO FOR THE QUADRSEPSES CAN BE LEG EXTENSIONS AND HACK SQUATS I USE HACK SQUATS BECAUSE I DON'T DO FREEBAR SQUATS FOR SAFETY REASONS AND I LIKE THE HACKSQUAT MACHINE I'LL DO LEG CURLS AND GLUTE HAM RASES FOR HAMSTRINGS AND I'LL DO STANDING CALFRASES AND SEE CALFRASES FOR THE CALFS AGAIN THOSE OF THE MOVEMENTS THAT I USE BECAUSE I CAN PERFORM THEM SAFELY IN THE REPETITION RANGES AND WITH THE WEIGHTS THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR ME TO EITHER MAINTAIN OR BUILD LEKE STRENGTH AND CALF STRENGTH BUT YOU MIGHT DECIDE THAT FOR YOU DEAD LIFTS ARE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL AND TERRIFIC OR SQUATS FREE BAR SQUATS AR ABSOLUTE TERRIFIC OR FRONT YOU KNOW FRONT SQUATS I'M NOT HERE TO TELL YOU WHICH EXERCISES TO DO ER NOT DO I AM TELLING YOU THAT IT'S PROBABLY WISE TO AT LEAST CONSIDER DOING AT LEAST TWO EXERCISES PERMUSCELE GROUP PROBABLY THREE MAXIMUM IF YOU ASK ME FOR DOING YOUR ENTIRE LEGS AND CALVS IN ONE DAY BUT TO THINK ABOUT DOING ONE EXERCISE WHERE THE MUSCLES BROUGHT INTO THAT SHORTEND PEQUE CONTRACTION POSITION LIKE LIKE CURLS ARE LIKE EXTENSIONS OR SEE TO CAFRES AND THEN ANOTHER EXERCISE FOR EACH MUSCELE GROUP WHERE THERE'S MORE OF A ELONGATION AND MAYBE EVEN A STRETCH ON THE MUSCELE GROUP IN FACT THAT'S A PRINCIPLE THAT YOU'LL HEAR ME TALK ABOUT LATER WHEN I TALK ABOUT TRAINING OTHER MUSCELE GROUPS FOR STRENGTH AND PYPERTROPHY SO NOW YOU KNOW APPROXIMATELY HOW LONG TO TRAIN YOU MIGHT BE SOMEBODY WHO CAN GET AWAY WITH TRAINING FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF AND THAT WON'T IMPEDE TO RECOVERY FOR ME THAT REALLY STARTS TO IMPEDE MY RECOVERY ALSO IF I'M STAYING ON TASK THAT SIXTY MINUTE LIMIT REALLY WORKS WELL FOR ME DO I OCCASIONALLY TRAIN FOR SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES YES BECAUSE IF I'M WAITING FOR A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT SOMETIMES I HAVE TO JUST WAIT LONGER SO THAT HAPPENS BUT I REALLY TRY AND KEEP THE TOTAL DURATION OF THE WORK OUT SHORTER HOW MANY SETS AND REPS AND REST INTERVALS WITTHOUT WAS COVERED BY DOCTOR ANDI GALPAN AS WELL WITHOUT GETTING INTO THE TOTAL SCIENCE HERES A BRIEF SUMMERY OF HOW TO STRUCTURE THAT IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO LOWER REPETITIONS AND HEAVIER WEIGHTS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO A BIT MORE VOLUME I KNOW THAT THIS SPITS IN THE FACE OF WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK BUT SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO FIVE SETS OF FIVE THAT I WOULD CONSIDER FIVE REPETITIONS LOW LOW REPETITION RANGE HEAVIER WEIGHT AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO TRAIN WITH HIGHER REPETITIONS YOU CAN DO FEWER SETS THAT CERTAINLY WORKS FOR ME I GENERALLY FOLLOW A PROGRAMM WHERE FOR ABOUT A MONTH SO THREE TO FOUR WEEKS I WILL DO ALL MY RESISTANCE TRAINING IN THE REPETITION RANGE OF ABOUT FOUR TO EIGHT REPETITIONS SO THAT'S RATHER HEAVY A FEW MORE SETS SO IT MIGHT BE ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO FOUR SETS PER EXERCISE AGAIN STILL JUST TWO EXERCISES AND LONGER REST BETWEEN SETS ANYWHERE FROM TWO MINUTES TO MAYBE EVEN FOUR MINUTES IF IT'S REALLY HEAVY LEG WORK AND THEN FOR THE NEXT MONTH SWITCH TO REPETITION RANGE THAT'S CLOSER TO EIGHT TO TWELVE MAYBE EVEN FIFTEEN REPETITIONS PER SET BUT DO FEWER SETS OVER ALL SO MAY BE JUST TWO TO THREE SETS PER EXERCISE AGAIN JUST TWO EXERCISES PER MUSCELL GROUP TYPICALLY AND SHORTEN THE REST BETWEEN SETS SO THAT IT'S MORE IN THAN NINETY SECOND MAY E UNIN AS SHORT AS SIXTY SECOND RESTS BETWEEN SETS PETIPICALLY NINETY SECONS TO ABOUT TWO MINUTES OR TWO AND A HALF MINUTES SO BESILY IT'S ONE MONTH HEAVIER THE NEXT MONTH SLIGHTLY LIGHTER ALTHOUGH I WOULDN'T SAY LIGHT OUTS A MODERATE WEIGHT AND MODERATE RECPKRAIN THAT TENS TO WORK WELL FOR ME IT ALSO ADHERES TO A PRINCIPLE THAT CAME UP DURING THE DISCUSSION AGAIN WITH DOCTOR ANDY GALPAN THAT FOR HYPERCROPHY YOU REALLY CAN USE REPETITION RANGES ANYWHERE FROM FIVE TO THIRTY THREE ZERO REP BUT HE EMPHASIZE CHANGING THE REPETITION RANGES IN ORDER TO OFFSET BORDOM FRANKLY I LIKE TO TRAIN HEAVIER I ENJOY TRAINING IN THE FOUR TO EIGHT REP RANGE HOWEVER I NOTICE THAT IF I DO THAT FOR MORE THAN FOUR WEEKS IN A ROW AND I DON'T SWITCH OVER TO TRAINING IN THE EIGHT TO TWELVE MAY BE IN FIFTEEN REPETITION RANGE FOR ABOUT A MONTH WELL THEN I CAN'T MAKE CONTINUOUS PROGRESS I START ACTUALLY LOSE GROUND BUT BY SWITCHING BACK AND FORTH IACTUALLY CAN MAKE CONTINUOUS PROGRESS AT LEAST ACROSS THE YEAR SO I HOPE THAT THAT PRINCIPLE OR I SHOULD SAY THAT PROTOCALL A WAS COMMUNICATED CLEARLY IT WORKS VERY WELL I ASSURE YOU DOES THAT MEAN THAT I NEVER GET TEN REPETITIONS ON A WEEK WHEN I'M I'S SUPPOSE TO TRAIN IN THE FOUR TO EIGHT REPETITION RANGE NO OCCASIONALLYI'LL VENTURE UP INTO THE TEN REPETITION RANGE BUT I REALLY TRYING CLUSTER THE LOW REPETITION WORK FOR ABOUT A MONTH AGAIN ACROSS ALL WORK OUTS IN ALL EXERCISES AND THE SLIGHTLY HIRE OUTUENCE A MODERATE REPETITION WORK ACROSS TO THE NEXT MONTH ONE THING THAT YOU'LL NOTICE SINCE WE ARE TUNG ABOUT TOTAL FITNESS PROGRAMMING IS THAT DURING THE MONTH SWHERE YOU ARE DOING MODERATE REPETITIONS YOU'LL NOTICE THAT YOURE ENDURANCE WORK WILL ACTUALLY BE FACILITATED AND I DO NOT THINK THAT'S A QUINCENCE IN FACT ITS NOT A COINCIDENCE IT'S BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE TRAINING VERY HEAVY OR IN THE HEAVIER RANGE LOWER REPETITIONS ET CETERA YOU'RE TAPPING INTO DIFFERENT PROCESSES IN THOSE MUSCLES SO WHEN YOU HEAD OUT FOR THAT LONG SUNDAY HEIGHT OR AS YOU'LL SOON HERE WHEREAS ON FRIDAY YOURE GING TO DO HIGNTENSTE INTERVAL TRAINING WE YO'LL NOTICE IS DURING CERTAIN MONTHS OF WEIGHT TRAINING WHEN YOU'RE TRAINING MORE HEAVY THOSE WORK OUTS WILL FEEL WLITERALLY WILL FEEL DIFFERENT THEN THEY WILL DURING THE MONTHS WHEN YOU'RE DOING MODERATE REPETITION WORK I AM NOT A COMPETITIVE ATHLETE I'M NOT RUNNING RACES OR TRYATH LAWNS LIKE SOME OF MY FRIENDS I'M VERY IMPRESSED BY THEM I'M REALY JUST TRYING TO GET OVER ALL CARTY OV ASCULAR FITNESS OVERALL STRAIN OVER ALL HYPERTROPHY WHERE I NEED IT MAINTAIN MUSCLESIZE ET CETERA IN MUSCLE GROUPS FOR IM JUST TRYING TO MAINTAIN THAT'S REALLY MY GOAL SO I'M NOT TRYNG TO OPTIMIZE ANY OF THESE WORK OUTS FOR ANY ONE PERFORMANCE FEATURE BUT IN A LITTLE BIT WILL TALK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN CHANGE VARIOUS ASPECTS THAT IS VARIABLE TO THIS PROTOCALS IN ORDER TO SAY FOR INCSINTS REALLY EMPHASIZE HYPERTROPHY OR REALLY EMPHASIZE ENDURANCE OKASSO WITH WHAT I WILL CALL A STANDARD ENDURANCE WORK OUT DONE ON SUNDAY AND I SAY STANDARD BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY HERE ENDURANCE THEY THINK OF THE ABILITY TO ENDURE TO CONTINUE A NA REPEATED MOVEMENT OR EXERCISE OVER SOME PARIAT IVE TIMEH WITH THAT WORK OUT DONE ON SUNDAY AND THEN WITH THE LEG WORK OUT DONE ON MONDAY YOU CAN FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT HOW YOU'RE HEADING INTO THE WEEK HOWEVER AFTER TRAINING LEGS ON MONDAY I EXPERIENCE THAT DOING CART OF ASCULAR WORK OUTS THE NEXT DAY IS EITHER INEFFICIENT OR AT LEAST DOESN'T REALLY ALLOW ME TO COMPLETELY RECOVER FROM MY LEG WORK OUT I REALIZE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO IMMEDIATELY SCOFF AT THAT AND IN FACT THERE ARE REALLY BEAUTIFUL PAPERS OUT THERE TALKING ABOUT HOW ONE CAN ACTUALLY DO FAIR AMOUNT OF CARDY OF ASCULAR EXERCISE WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH THEIR STRENGTH AND SPEED AND HYPERTERFE IMPROVEMENTS AND VICE VERSA IN FACT THERE'S A TERRIFIC REVIEW THAT WAS MENTIONED ON THE PODCASTS WITH DOCTOR ANDY GALP AND THIS IS A A REVIEW THAT WILL PROVIDE A CITATION TO ON AND A REFERENCE AND A LINK TO WHICH IS THE REVIEW BY A MURACK AND BAGLY WHICH TALKS ABOUT WHETHER NOT THERE'S INTERFERENCE BETWEEN STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE WORK OUTS REALLY INTERESTING REVIEW IF YOU WANT OT APPRUSE THAT BUT WITH ALL THAT SAID I LIKE TO TAKE TUESDAY AS A NO ENDURANCE NO RESISTANCE TRAINING DAY BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING FOR MY OVER ALL HEALTH AND FITNESS ON TUESDAYS I DO A SERIES OF HEAT COLD CONTRAST IN OTHER WORDS I GET REALLY REALLY WARM AND THEN I GET REALLY REALLY COLD I GET REALLY REALLY WARM WHND I GET REALLY RE COLD REPEATEDLY AND THE WAY I DO THAT IS BY GETTING INTO A HOT SANA SO FOR ME THAT'S REALLY HOT BUT I'VE BUILT UP MY HEAT CONDITIONING SO PLEASE DON'T DO THIS UNLESS YOU'VE BUILT UP YOUR A ABILITY TO WITHSTAND HEAT AND I'LL GET IN FOR ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES SOMETIMES FIFTEEN BUT USUALLY TWENTY MINUTES THEN I GET OUT AND THEN I WILL GET INTO AN ICE BATH OR A COLD WATER BATH THAT'S ABOUT FORTY FIVE TO FIFTY DEGREES FERNHEIGHT AGAIND DON'T GET IN TO WATER THATS SO COLD THAT YOU GO IN TO SHOCK I'LL EXPLAIN WHAT A GOOD COLD UM STIMULUS COULD BE FOR YOU AND HOW TO DETERMINE THAT OR IF I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO MY SAUNA AND MY ICE BATH WHAT I CAN DO IF I'M TRAVELLING AS I WILL TAKE A HOT BATH AND THEN ALTERNATE WITH COLD SHOW OR HOT BATH COLD SHOWER AM IT'S HARD TO DO HOT BATH ICE BATH UNLESSYOU HAVE TWO BATHS I ON'T NO ANY HOTEL ROOMS AT LEAST I'VE NEVER STATED ONE THAT HAS TWO BATHS ALONE SURE THER OUT THERE BUT FOR ME THIS IS HEAT COLD CONTRAST AND REALLY WHAT THIS DAY IS ABOUT IS TWO THINGS FIRST OF ALL I'M TRYING TO ACCELERATE RECOVERY FROM THE LEG WORK OUT I DID PREVIOUSLY ALSO IF YOU LISTEN TO OUR EPISODE OF THE HUBERMN LAPODCAST ABOUT DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE OR YOU LISTEN TO OUR EPISODE TO THE HU BREN LAPODCASTS ABOUT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE I TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF HEAT AND COLD AND I GET INTO A LOT OF DETAILS ABOUT HOW YOU CAN ACCESS HEAT YOU CAN DO BATHS YOU CAN DO SANAS YOU CAVEN TAKE HOT SHOWERS  YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESTINY OF THAT YOU CAN EVEN WRAP YOUR BODY FROM THE NECK DOWN IN FARBIAGE BAG PLASTIC GARBIDGE BAGS BELIVEE'RE NOT WRESTLERS USED TO DO THIS PUT ON SOME SWEATS AND GO RUNNING THAT'LL GET YOU WARM AGAIN BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVER HEAT AND THEN YOU CAN GET INTO A COLD SHOWER SO THE LOT OF WAYS DEPENDING ON YOUR BUDGET IN WHAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO I DON'T USE CRYO THESE CROWD THERUPY CHAMBERS THEY'RE HARD TO FIND THEIR EXPENSIVE AM AGAIN I USANA AND ICE BATH AND I WILL DO ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO FIVE ROUNDS WHICH IS A LOT ANYUWHERE FROM THREE TO FIVE ROUNDS OF HEAT FOR ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES AND COLD FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES HOW COLD SHOULD THE COLD BE WE COVER THIS IN THE EPISODE ON TDELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE HERE'S A GENERAL RULE OF THUMB IT SHOULD BE COLD ENOUGH THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO GET OUT BUT NOT SO COLD THAT IT'S UNSAFE AND THAT WILL VARY FROM PERSON O PERSONS I CANNOT GIVE YOU A THE SIMPLE PRESCRIPTIVE THERE SAME THING WITH THE HEAT HOT ENOUGH THAT YOU'RE SWEATING AND TH YOU WANT TO GET OUT BUT NOT SO HOT THAT YOU'RE RUNNING THE RIS OF INJURING YOURSELF FOR KILLING YOURSELF AND AGAIN THAT WILL VARY FROM PERSON OF PERSONS YOU HAVE TO BUILD UP SLOWLY BE CAREFUL AND BUILD UP EMPURICALLY I DO THAT ON TUESDAYS AGAIN AS A WAY TO ACCELERATE RECOVERY AND BECAUSE IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THEIR CARDO VASCULAR BENEFITS MAY BE EVEN BENEFIT'S FOR THE BRAIN RELATED TO THE CARDY OF ASCULAR BENEFITS BECAUSE WORSE THE BRAIN NEEDS A LOT OF BLOOD FLOW AND NEEDS A LOT OF A NEUTRAANS AND OTHER THINGS FLOWING INTO AND OUT OF THEIRE DEBRIS OUT AND NEUTRIENCS AND OTHER THINGS INTO THE BRAIN HEAT CAN HELP ACCELERATE THAT OR IMPROVE THAT AND SO I'M DOING THAT TO IMPROVE CARDIOF VASCULAR FUNCTION IMPROVE BRAIN HEALTH AND THEN THE COLD CONTRAST PROVIDES THAS SORT OF ACCELERATOR ON THAT OR AN AMPLIFIER I THINK IT'S THE BETTER WAY TO PHRASE IT ON THAT PROCES BECAUSE IN THE COLD YOU GET VAZO CONSTRICTION AND THEN IN THE HEAT YOU GET VASE AF DILATION INTO YOUR MAXIMIZING THAT PROCESS WHICH IS ACTUALLY A NURAL PROCESS NERVES ACTUALLY ENERVATE THE BLOOD VESSELS AN CAPLARIES AND AND EVEN THE ARTERIES IN ORDER TO ALLOW THAT CONSTRIPTION IN DILATION PROCESS TO OCCUR SO TUESDAY IS REALLY ABOUT RECOVERY BUT MY RECOVERY DAY ISN'T NECESSARILY ABOUT I JUST LAYING AROUND AND NOT DOING ANYTHING I MIGHT STILL ALSO TAKE SOME WALKS THAT DAY REMEMBER I WANT AT TRYING GET THAT TWO HUNDREDMINUTES OF ZON TWO CARDIO CROSS THE WEEK AND SOMETIMES NOT OFTEN BUT SOMETIMES I'LL GET IN A FEW AM MINUTES OR MORE OF WALKING QUICKLY THAT DAY BUT GENERALLY I'M WORKING A LOT ON TUESDAY AS I DO ON MONE DAY AND I'M MALUBIT TIRED A MAY BE EVEN A LITTLE BIT SORE FROM MY LEG WORK OUT THE PREVIOUS DAY MONDAY SO I TRY AND GET THAT HOT COLD CONTRAST THERE ARE OTHER BENEFITS TO HOT AND COLD CONTRAST WE HAVE A DESCRIPTION OF THE DIFFERENT PROTOCALS FOR HOT AND FOR COLD AND THEIR CONTRAST AND OUR HUBERMAN LAV NEWSLETTER YOU CAN FIND THAT BY GOING TO HUBAN LAV DOT COM GO TO THE NEWS LETER TAB ONDER THE MENYU EN YOU CAN SIGN UP AN I SHLE DOWN LOW THOSE PROTOCOLS VERY EASILY WITHOUT EVEN SIGNING UP IF YOU JUST WONE O ACESS STRAIGHT OFF SO TUESDAYS REALLY ABOUT RECOVERY ANG ABOUT GETTING SOME ADDITIONAL CARDIO VASCULAR BENEFITS FROM HEAT COLD CONTRAST ONE OTHER THING THAT'S BUILT INTO THE RATION AL FOR DOING A LOT OF HEAT AND COLD ON ONE DAY AS UPPOSED TO DOING IT EVERY DAY WELL IN ADDITION TO IT BEING A LIMIT MORE CONVENIENT BECAUSE CERTAINLY SOME PEOPLE DON'T ACCESS TO HEAT IN COLD SANAN COLD DUNKS AT CETERA EVERY DAY SO MAY BE GETTING TO I DO THAT ONE DAY IS MORE ACCESSIBLE OR FEASIBLE BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT WHILE THERE ORE BENEFITS TO DOING SANA OFTEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE DELIBERATE HEAT EPISODE AND THE EPISODE WITH DOCTOR RONA PATRICK WHEN SHE WAS A GUEST ON THIS PODCAST IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT IF YOU DO SANA CELDOM THAT IS ONCE A WEEK BUT YOU DO A LOT OF IT ON ONE DAY SO IN THIS CASE IT'S AN HOUR IF IT'S EMEMBER IT'S OR MORE IT'S THREE TO FIVE ROUNDS OF TWENTY MINUTES OF SANA FOLLOWED BY ABOUT FIVE MINUTES OF COLD OR SO BY DOING THAT OLL ON ONE DAY THE PURE VIEW TO RESEARCH THAT'S COVE RD IN THE EPISODE ON DELIBERATE HEAT S IS IT A STUDY OUT OF FINDLAND SHOW THAT YOU GET MASSIVE EVEN SIXTEEN FOLD INCREASES IN GROWTH HORMONE WHICH ARE EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL FOR METABOLISM AND FOR RECOVERY SO THESE MASSIVE INCREASES IN GROWTH HORMONE ARE SEEN WHEN YOU ARE DOING THESE SESSIONS OF SANA THAT ARE REPEATED ON THE SAME DAY AND YOUR ONLY DOING THAT ABOUT ONCE A WEEK WHEREAS IF YOU DO SANA MORE OFTEN THERE ARE CERTAINLY BENEFITS TO THAT BUT ITS TIME CONSUMING AND YOU NEED ACCESS TOF SANA MORE OFTEN THAN ONE DAY A WEEK IF YOU'R DOING IT MORE THAN ONE DAY A WEEK BUT IF YOU DO ONE DAY A WEEK IN YOUR DOING A LOT OF SESSIONS WITHIN THAT DAY AS I'VE DETAILED HERE YOU SEE THESE MASSIVE INCREASES IN GROWTH HORMON THAT ARE NOT OBSERVED IF YOU'RE DOING SANA MORE OFTEN FOR THE OTHER BENEFITS OF SANA NOW THE EFFECTS OF COLD ARE MANY AND S NOTCHES VASE OF CONSTRICTION BUT THE EFFECTS OF COLD ARE ALSO COUNTERBALANCE BY SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WITH DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE THEN MAYBE YOU HEARD ABOUT ON THIS PODCAS AND A LOT OF OTHER PODCASSIN SEEM TO BE A AND OF A ABUZZTHEME ON TWITTERAND ELSEWHERE AND THE POINT IS THIS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF QUALITY STUDYES SHOWING THAT IF YOU DO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IN PARTICULAR ICE BATHS OR GETTING INTO VERY COLD WATER IMMEDIATELY AFTER AND ENDURANC STRAINING SESSION OR A STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY SESSION IT CAN INDEED YES IT CAN DISRUPT OR PREVENT SOME OF THE ADAPTATIONS THAT YOU ARE SEEKING WITH STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY AND ENDURANCE WORK OUTS SO YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT AND I BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE BASED ON NOW SEVERAL QUALITY PURE REVIEWED STUDIES SO BY DOING YOUR DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE ON TUESDAY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THOSE OF FACTS THAT IS THED BLOCKING OF HYPERTROPHY OR THE BLOCKING OF STRENGTH IMPROVEMENT OR THE BLOCKING OR PREVENTION OF IMPROVEMENTS AND ENDURANCE THAT WOULD OCCUR AF YOU IMMEDIATELY GOT INTO THE ICE BATH AFTER A HYPERTROPHY STRENGTH OR ENDURANCE WORKOUT NOW THE CAVIAT TO THAT IS IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO LIKES TO DO COLD SHOWERS I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY DATA THAT SAYS THAT COLD SHOWERS CANNOT BE PERFORMED AFTER A STRENGTH HYPERTROPHY YOUR ENDURANCE WORKOUT COLD SHOWERS OR DIFFERENT THEN SUBMERSION UP TO THE NECK IN AN ICE BATH OR ANOTHER COLD BODY OF WATER FOR A NUMBER DIFFERENT REASONS IN FACT THEY TAPPEN TO DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM ENTIRELY WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO INTO THAT NOW IT'S COVERED IN THE EPISODE ON DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE BUT THE SIMPLE POINT IS BY DOING YOUR HEAT AND COLD CONTRAST OR AY LISTEN IF YOUR SOMEBODY DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO SANAR YOU DON'T LIKE COTBATS IN YOU JUST DO SOME ADELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE ON TUESDAY YOU ARE DOING THAT SEPARATE FROM YOUR STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY AND ENDURANCE WORKOUTS SUCH THAT IT WILL NOT IMPED THE BENEFITS OF THOSE WORK OUTS O CASE A LONG ENDURANCE ON SUNDAY LEG RESISTANCE TRAINING ON MONDAY AND ON TUESDAY HEAT COLD CONTRAST THAT BRINGS US TO WEDNESDAY AND ON WEDNESDAY WE GET BACK TO A RESISTANCE TRAINING WORK OUT AND THE RESISTANCE TRAINING WORK OUT THAT I EMPHASIZE ON WEDNESDAY IS ONE IN WHICH YOU TRAIN YOUR TORSO YES LITERALLY YOUR TORSO I KNOW THIS IS COUNTER TO THE O CALLED BROW SCIENCE OF BROW SPLITS ON'TNO WHO ORIGINATED THAT TERM IT'S A TERRIBLE TERM INT OF ESSENTIALLY A ALIENATES ANY ONE WHO'S NOT A BROW OR CONSIDERS THEMSELVES A BROW BUT IN ANY CASE THIS IS NOT ABOUT TRAINING CHEST OR BACK OR SHOULDERS IN FACT IT'S REALLY ABOUT STRAINGTHENING THE MUSCLES OF THE TORSO AND OF COURSE INCLUDES THE CHEST AN THE SHOULDERS AND THE BACK AND I'M SHURE AS I SAY THIS A NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT THER WHO ARE OBSESSED WITH HYPERTROPHY AND MUSCLE GROWTH AND FILLING OUT THEIR SHURTS OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE ARE THING OH NO YOU KNOW THIS IS JUST KIND OF ALL AROUND FITNESS BUT NO THE POINT IS ON WEDNESDAY YOU TRAIN YOUR TORSO AND THAT'S GOING TO INVOLVE SOME PUSHING SO THAT'S FOR YOU IT MIGHT INCLUDE SOME TRAINING OF THINGS LIKE BENCH PRESSES OR INCLIME PRESSES AS WELL AS SHOULDER PRESSES OR LATTERAL RAISES THINGS FOR THE SHOULDERS AS WELL AS FOR THE BACKS OME PULLING EXERCISES THESE CON BE BENT OVER ROWS OR CHIN UPS OR PULL UPS AGAIN THER ARE ENORMOUS NUMBER OF EXERCISE FOR EACH IN EVERY ONE OF THESE MUSCLE GROUPS NOW I BELIEVE THERE'S A CLEAR BENEFIT TO TRAINING ALL THESE MUSCLE GROUPS TOGETHER ON THE SAME DAY BECAUSES MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT TRAINING LEGS ALL ON ONE DAY CAN LEAD TO THE SYSTEMIC EFFECTS BECAUSE THEIR LARGE MUSCLE GROUPS WORKING BOTH THE PUSHING MUSCLES IN THE PULLING MUSCLES OF THE TORSO ON ONE DAY LEAST IN THE CONTECTS OF THIS PROGRAM IS VERY TIME EFFICIENT AND TENDS TO WIK OUT INTO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF HEALTH AT LEAST I'M INTERESTED IN IN I THINK A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED WHAT ARE THOSE WELL LET'S THINK AGAIN I WANT TO BE STRONG IN NOT JUST MY LEGS BUT MY UPPERBODY I ALSO MAY WANT MAY WANT TO ENGAGE SOME HYPERTROPHY TO GROW CERTAIN MUSCLE GROUPS IN ORDER TO CREATE A SENSE OF BALANCE TIT CAUN BE FORSTHETIC REASONS BUT ALSO FOR BALANCING STRAINTH AND FOR HEALTH OF AND THE INTEGRITY OF THE JOINTS ET CETERA AND IN ADDITION THAT BY TRAINING A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT MUSCLE GROUPS TOGETHER YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE MORE S ASTEMIC HORMONAL EFFECTS AND METABOLIC EFFECTS THAT OCCUR WHEN YOU'RE NOT JUST TRAINING ONE MUSCLE GROUP IN ISOLATING THAT ONE MUSCLE GROUP BUT RATHER TRAINING A BUNCH OF MUSCLE GROUPS TOGETHER SO WEDNESDAY I TRAIN TORSO AND I DO THAT IN PUSHPULL FASHION JUST FOR AM KIND OF TIME EFFICIENCY SOMETIMES THAT MEANS DOING A PUSHING EXERCISE AND THEN A PULLING EXERCISE SOMETIMES IT MIGHT EVEN MEAN DOING A SET OF PUSHING AND THEN A SET OF PULLING AND GOING BACK AND FORTH HOWEVER IF YOU'RE IN A JIM AND A PARTICULAR CROWDED JIM PLEASE DON'T BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT COLONIZES MULCIBLE PIECES OF EQUIPMENT AND SAYS I'M WORKING THERE O'N WORKING THERE AND YET THAT CAN BE QUITE A DANCE AND D CON BE HARD TO TO ORCHISTRAIN TO WORK OUT LIKE THAT SO SOMETIMES IT WILL BE YOU' STARTING OFF WITH A SET OF SHOULDER PRESSES AND THEN DOING ALL YOU KNOW ALL YOUR SETS OF THOSE AND THEN MOVING TO YOUR CHIN UPS AND THEN MOVING PERHAPS BACK TO SHOULDERS AND REALISING AH A SO ONE'S ON THE MACHINE THAT I WANTED OR USING THE EQUIPMENT I WANTEDS I'LL JUST FINISH UP THE PULLING OFL FINISH UP THE BACKWORK AND THEN GOING TO THE PUSH I DON'T OBSESS OVER THE ALTERNATION IN ANY KIND OF STRICT WAY I REALLY JUST TRYINGD GET THE MUSCLES OF THE TORSO TRAINED AND AGAIN IT'S TWO EXERCISES PER MUSCLE GROUP AND ONE OF THOSE EXERCISES IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING WHERE THERE'S I REALIZE THIS ISN'N PHYSIO LOGICALLY ACCURATE BUT A SHORTENING OF THE MUSCLE OR WHERE THEY AT THE END OF THE MOVEMENT THE MUSCLE IS UNDER MAXIMAL CONTRACTION I COULD THROW OUT SOME NAMES OF EXERCISES JUST FOR FOR PURPOSE OF OF UNDERSTAINGS TO THIS WOULD BE YOU KNOW AM LIKE CABLE CROSSOVERS FOR THE CHEST THAT THE OF THE PIQE CONTRACTION IS AT THE END WHEREAS A SOMETHING LIKE AN IN CLINE PRESS THERE'S MORE OF A STRETCH PROVIDEDS DONE OVER FULL RANGE OF MOTION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVEMENTS SO AGAIN SOMETHING WHERE THERE'S A STRETCH IN SOMETHING WHERE THERE'S A PEAT CONTRACTION FOR THE SHOULDERS SA LITLE IT HARDER DO OTHER THEIR WAYS TO DO THAT AN CHEFF CAVALIER HAS EXCELLENT WORK OUTS AVAILABLES ZERO COST ON YOU TO BE ALSO HAS EXCELLENT PROGRAMS ON HIS AFTLY NEXT TAL COMSIGHT BUT CERTAINLY HAS A LOT OF EXCELLENT PROTO CALLS ON AS YOU TO AND INSTRAGRAM BUT ON YOU TO YOU CAN PUT IN HIS NAME AND ANY MUSCLE GRUP THAT YOU WANT A TRAIN HAS SOME TERRIFIC VIDIO'S DESCRIBING EXERCISED CHOICE AND OTHER FEATURES OF EXERCISE PERAMETERS AGAIN A PIQUE CONTRACTION OR SHORTENING OF THE MUSCLE PIQUE CONTRACTION EXERCISE AND A STRATCHING EXERCISE AND SO FOR THE BACK ONE MIGHT SAY O K I SEEDED ROW OR A BENTOVER ROW OR A DUMBELL ROW WHERE THE ELBOW AS BROUGHT BEHIND THE TORSO FOR A PIQUE CONTRACTING MOVEMENT AND THEN FROM MORE OF A STRACCING MOVEMENT MIGHT BE SOMETHING LIKE A A CHIN UP OR A PULL UP AND AS I SAY THIS I UNDERSTAND THAT STRETCCHING AND PIQE CONTRACTION AREN'T THE EXACT TERMS THAT ONE WOULD USE IF THEY WERE A PHYSIO THERAPIST ORE STRENGTH AND CONDITION IND COACH BUT I THINK FOR THE TYPICAL PERSON WHOSE TRYING TO GENERATE STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY IN THOSE MUSCLES ARE MAINTAIN STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY IN THOSE MUSCLES THIS KIND OF NOMINCLATUR WAY DESCRIBING IT AT LEAST SHOULD BE A CLEAR AND AND EVEN EFFICIENT AND JUST TO REMIND YOU AS WITH THE LEG WORK OUT THE TOTAL DURATION OF THE TORSO WORK OUT IS GOING TO BE FIFTY TO SIXTY MINUTES AFTER A BRIEF WARM UP THE SETS AND REPETITIONS ARE GOING TO BE DICTATED IN THE SAME WAY THAT I ASCRIBED EARLIER SO FOR ABOUT A MONTH IT'S GOING TO BE MORE SETS SO ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO FIVE SETS IN THE LOWER REPETITION RANGE O FOR O A REREPETITIONS SO THAT'S COM BE HAVE YOUR WEIGHTS AND LONGER REST AS I DESCRIBED EARLIER THE REST INTERVALS AND THEN FOR THE NEXT MONTH IT'S GOING TO BE MODERATE REPETITIONS FEWER SETS THE SAME WAY I DESCRIBED EARLIER AND IF YOU WANT MORE DETAILS ON ALL OF THAT YOU CAN FIND THAT IN THE NEWS LETTER RELATED TO THE OPTIMAL OR FOUNDATIONALL FITNESS PROTOCALL TAT YOU CAN ACCESS AT HUBERMAN LAPDOK CALM ONETHING I SHOULD NOTE ABOUT THE WENSTAY TORSO WORK OUT IS THAT I AM A BIG BELIEVER IN TRAINING THE WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE HIGHLY A AVOIDED OR AT LEAST OVERLOOKED BUT VITALLY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF TOTAL BODY STABILITY STREINGTH AND SAFETY REALLY SAFETY WHICH IS THE NECK I REALIZE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T WANT A LARGE NECK AND I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND FOR A STHETIC REASONS WHY THEY DON'T WANT THAT IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING AXTUALLY IF YOU THNK ABOUT IT THAT PEOPLE HAVE A LARGE NECK ARE OFTEN TOLD THEY HAVE NO NECK PEOPLE SAT THIK I HAS NO NECK OR HEY 'VE NO NECK WHEN IN FACT THE REFERING TO THE FACT THAT THEYHAVE A VERY LARGE NECK HOW IT CAME TO BE SOMEBONE YOU PUT IN THE COMMENTS WHY THAT IS HOW COME WHEN PEOPLE OF A BIG NECK THEY REFER TO IT AS NO NECK SO WHY DO I TRAIN THE NECK I TRAIN THE NECK FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS ONE IS YEARS AGO I HAD NACKSENT WHERE I SHL FELL OFF A ROOF AND I'D BEEN TRAINING MY NECK AT THAT TIME A FOR A SPORT THAT I WAS INVOLVED IN AND I WALKED AWAY FROM IT WITH A SORE NECK BUT NOT A BROKEN NECK AND I THOUGHT WHILE IT'S REALLY GREAT THAT I HAVE UM A BEEN TRAINING MY NECK IN ADDITION TO THAT I WAS ONCE IN A CAR ACCIDENT WHERE I WAS PART I JUST BOUGHT THE CAR MY FIRST NEW CAR PURCHASE PART IN THAT CAR WITH MY MOTHER MY GRANDFATHER IN THE BACK SEAT AT THE RED LIGHT AND SOME ONE RAMMED INTO US AT FULL SPEED NOW FORTUNATELY NONE OF US WERE HURT WHER WE WERE ALL UM RATTLED UM AND ONCE AGAIN I WAS VERY SORE IN MY BACK AND IN MY NECK BUT I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I WAS ABLE TO SINCE YHEU WALK AWAIY FROM THAT I DIDN'T HAVE ANY A SUSTAIN DAMAGE WAS BECAUSE I TRAIN MY NECK BUT I STARTED TRAINING MY NECK FOR SPORT AND I CONTINUE TO TRAIN MY NECK BECAUSE I NOTICE WHEN I DON'T TRAIN MY NECK I START GETTING SHOULDER ISSUES AND IF YOU TALK TO AND EXCELLENT PHYSIOLOGIST LIKE DOCTOR KELLY STARRETT OF THE READY STATE AS I EXCELLENT CHANNEL IF IN AM ON ALL THE SOCIAL MEDIUM STANDARD CHANNELS ARE YOU TALK TO A ANY ONE OUT THERE WHO REALLY UNDERSTANDS THE STRENGTH OF THE TORSO IN THE UPPER BODY AND EVEN THE BACK WHAT YOU LEARN IS THAT OF COURSE BEING THE UPPER PORTION OF THE SPINE STABLE IZING YOUR NECK IS VERY IMPORTANT NOW TRAINING THE NECK CAN BE A LITTLE BIT DETAILED AND SPECIFIC AND EVEN DANGEROUS IF YOU DO IT WRONG AGAIN JEFF CAVALIER HAS A TERRIFIC SET OF IDIOS ON TRAINING THE NECK PROPERLY I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE MIGHT THINK NECK BRIDGES AND I USED TO DO NECK BRIDGES I OCCASIONALLY STILL SNEAK I A NECK BRIDGE HERE OR THERE ALTHOUGH I DON'T RECOMMEND IT BECAUSE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH JEFF HE WILL TELL YOU AND IT'S TRUE THAT THE DISKS EVENTUALLY GO AND YOU CAN RUN INTO SERIOUS ISSUES FROM DOING BRIDGES AND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN GRADUALLYES WYOU CAN'T NOTICE IT HAPPENY JUST HAPPEN SUDDENLY SO I MIGHT OCCASIONALLY DO A NECK BRIDGE BUT IN GENERAL I'LL TRAIN NECK BY RAPPING A PLATE IN A TOWEL SO THAT IT ON'T END UP WITH AN IMPRINT OF THE THE WEIGHT VALUE ON MY HEAD OR FACE AND THEN MOVING THE NECK FROM SIDE TO SIDE OR FRONT OR BACK AND AGAIND WE'LL PROVIDE A LINK TO THOSE VIDIOS IT'S A TERRIFIC SET OF IDIOS TO DESCRIBE HOW TO TRAIN YOUR NECK PROPERLY AN SAFELY SO EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO GROW YOUR NECK YOU DEFULLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SOME LIGHT WEIGHTS TO MAK SURE THAT YOUR NECK IS STABLE AND UPRIGHT I SAY STABLE AND UPRIGHT BECAUSE IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT FOR REASONS RELATED TO TECKTING AND STARING DOWN AT COMPUTERS AND RELATED TO WEAK NECK RELATIVE TO THE REST OF THE MUSCLES THAT STABLEIZED THE SPINE A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE DEFAULT STANCS FOR THEIR DEFALT POSTURE IS WITH CHIN FORWARD AND THAT'S NOT GOOD NOT ONLY IS IT ESCETICALLY NOT GOOD BUT IT ALSO CAN CREATE ALL SORTS OF ISSUES RELATE TO BACK PAIN AND HEADACHES AND THINGS THAT SORT THIS IS A REAL THING TRAINING YOUR NECK ALLOWS YOU TO STAND UPRIGHT SIT UPRIGHT I EVEN BELIEVE THAT IT ALLOWS YOU TO DO THINGS LIKE PUBLIC SPEAKING OR HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLELL THE STREET IN A WAY WHERE YOU ARE FRONT FACING AS SUPPOSE TO LOOKING DOWN SO WEDNESDAY IS TORSO AND NECK AND THEN COMES THURSDAY AND THAT MEANS ANOTHER CARTY OF ASCULAR EXERCISE CESSION ALTHOUGH IT'S A BRIEF ONE UNLIKE THE ENDURANCE TRAINING ON SUNDAY THE CARDY OF ASCULAR CESSION ON THURSDAY AND AGAIN FOR ME IT FALLS ON THURSDAY BUT FOR YOU IT COULD FALL ON A DIFFERENT DAY DEPENDING ON WHEN YOU STARTED THIS PROTOCAL IS GOING TO BE ABOUT AGAIN ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MINUTES OF FOR ME RUNNING ALTHOUGH IT COULD BE ROWING OR COULD BE CYCLING IT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT SORT THE GOAL OF THIS WORK OUT IS WHAT'S IMPORTANT THE GOAL OF THIS WORK OUT IS TO TAP IN TO MEMBER THAT LONG LIST WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WE'VE GOT SKILL AND SPEED AND POWER AND STRENGTH AND HYPERTOPY ET CETERA DIFFRENT FORMS OF ENDURANCE IS TO GET INTO THAT RANGE OF ENDURANTES WHERE YOUR HEART RATE IS ELEVATED QUITE A BIT MORE THAN ZOWN TO BUT THEY YOU'RE NOT REALLY GOING ALL OUT SPRINT SO WHAT THAT MEANS FOR ME IS WARMING UP FOR ABOUT FIVE TO TEN MINUTES THAT COULD BE JOGGING A LITTL BIT OF LIHT CALISTHENICS MIGHT EVEN BE HOPPYG ON A STATIONARY BYCL THOUGH TO BE AS I LOATHE THE STATIONARY BYKE AND THEN SETTING A TIMER AND DOING ABOUT THIRTY BUT IDEALLY THIRTY FIVE MINUTES OF WHAT I CALL SEVENTY FIVE TO EIGHTY PER CENT OF ALL OUT O CAN I REALIZE THIS SPITS IN THE FACE OF ALL YOU HEART RATE MONITOR WEARING AM SUPERTEKE EXERCISE TYPES BUT WHEN I THINK OF ALL OUTSPRINT I THINK OF ONE HUNDRED PER CENT AND WHAT IS THAT IN MY MIND THAT'S SOMEBODY IS CHASING ME WITH A NEEDLE FUL OF POISON AND I AM SPRINTING AWAY AT MAXIMAL SPEED THAT FOR ME IS A HUNDRED PER CENT SO AFTER A BRIEF WARM UP WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS GO OUT TYPICALLY OUTSIDE ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES ASKE TO BE ON A TREAD MILIF I'M TRAVELING AND MOVE RUN FOR ABOUT THIRTY TO THIRTY FIVE MINUTES AT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE OR EIGHTY PER CENT OF THAT ALL OUT WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT I'M STRIVING TO KEEP A STEADY PACE BUT IN REALITY I DON'T I SOMETIMES HAVE TO STOP IT A STOP LIGHT THERE ARE CARS PLEASE DON'T RUN INTO TRAFFIC JUST TO MAINTAIN THAT'S SPEED IN THAT TIMING THAT WOULD BE TERRIBLY I ANTAGONISTIC TO A FITNESS IN PARTICULAR LIFE SPENT THAT RUNNING TENDS TO BE RUNNING IN WHICH I'M BREATHING HARD SO I'M NOT ABLE TO RESTRICT MYSELF TO PURELY NASAL BREATHING AND I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED EARLIER ON THE SUNDAY LONG RUCK OR WAITED HIKE OR JOG IF I'M ALONE I TRYING DO PURE NASAL BREATHING IF I'M WITH OTHER PEOPLE OR I'M TALKING OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT GIN DO PURE NASAL BREATHINGMBECASM TALKING ALTHOUGH I 'MSURE THAT SOMETIMES THEY WISH I WAS DOING PURE NASAL BREATHING THAT THURSDAY WORK OUT ACCOMPLISHES A NUMBER OF THINGS FIRST OF ALL IT REALLY GETS MY HEART RAY UP AND IT IMPROVES MULTIBLE ASPECTS OF ENDURANCE BECAUSE AS YOU RECALL EARLIER THE DIFFERENT BINS OF ENDURANCE THAT INCLUE MUSCULAR ENDURANCE ANEROBIC THAT THREE TO TWELVE MINUTE RANGE IN THAN THIRTY MINUTES OR LONGER NONE OF THEM REALLY PRECISELY MATCH WHAT'S ACCOMPLISH IN THIS THIRTY FIVE MINUTE OR SO CARDY OV ASK ULAR SECSION WHERE I'M PUSHING HARD BUT NOT ALL OUT BUT THAT'S EXACTLY THE REASON TO DO IT WHICH IS THAT IT TAPS INTO MULTIBLE FUEL SYSTEMS FOR THE MUSCLE AND MULTIBLE ASPECTS OF THE HART AND CAPLARIES AND ARTERIES IN VAINS THAT ARE INVOLVED IND GENERATING THAT MOVEMENT SO IT REALLY CUTS A BROAD SWATH INTO MULTIPLE CATEGORIES OF ENDURANCE AND ALSO JUST KEEP IN MIND WHAT THIS FOUNDATIONAL OR OPTIMULFITNESS PROTOCAL IS REALLY DESIGNE TO DO IN MY MIND A FOUNDATIONALL FITNESS PROTOCALL IS ONE THAT LEAVES YOU OR HAS YOU IN A STATE WHERE IF YOU NEED TO WALK REALLY FAR AND CARRY A BUNCH OF WEIGHT YOU CAN DO IT IF YOU NEED TO LIFT TO HAVEY OBJECT WITH YOUR LEGS YOU CAN DO IT IF YOU NEED TO RUN REALLY FAST FOR TWO MINUTES YOU CAN DO IT AND IF YOU NEED TO RUN A LITTLE BIT FURTHER LIKE MABO IN TEN MINUTES FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU CAN DO THAT SO IT'S A REALLY CO ALL AROUND FITNESS PROGRAM AND THAT THIRTY FIVE MINUTE RUN AGAIN COULD BE SWAP FOR THE THIRTY FIVE MINUTE ERGRO OR SOMETIMES IF YOU ONLY HAVE ACCESS TO A STATIONARY BITE YOU DO THAT I SUPPOSE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO ANY EQUIPMENT AND RUNNING IS NOT YOUR THING NONETHING THAT I HAVE DONE ESPECIALLY IF I'VE BEEN STUCK IN A HOTEL CAUSE I ARRIVE LATE SOME PLACE AND I REALLY WONT TO GET THIS WORK OUT IN YOU COULD DO THE DREADED BERPY I KNOW  LOUT OF OPINIONS OUT THERE SOME PEOPLE IN BERPEES ARE DOWNRIGHT DANGEROUS OTHER PEOPLE LOVE BERPIES YOU CA DO THAT OR YOU CUL DO REALLY FAST BUT FULL JUMPING JACKS I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE P E CLASS RIGHT PHYSICAL EDUCATION CLASS ISH BUT SOMETIMES IF I NEED TO GET THE WORK OUT IN WHAT I'LL DO IN A HOTEL IF I'VE ARRIVED LATE IN PARTICULAR THEY HAVE TRAVEL AS I WILL FIND THE STAREWELL THE FIRE STAREWELL I'LL MAKE SURE BY THE WAY THAT I CAN GET BACK INTO THE BUILDING CAUSE I'VE BEEN LOCKED IN THOSE STAIREWALLS BEFORE AND I WILL SIMPLY WALK REALLY FAST UP THE STAREWELL AS MANY FLIGHTS OF STAIRS AS THERE ARE OR MAYBE EVEN JOGET NOT QUITE SPRINT BUT MEY RUN UP THOSE STAIRS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN ORDER TO GET THAT THIRTY FIVE MINUTES OF SEVENTY FIVE TO EIGHTY PER CENT OF MAC OUTPUT CARTY VASCULAR WORK DONE AND IF I'M REALLY JUST RESTRICTED TO BY HOTEL RUM I'LL JUST DO JUMPING JACKS FOR THIRTY THIRTY FIVE MINUTES SOMETIMES WHILE WATCHING SOMETHING ON TV AND BELIEVE ME IF YOU'RE DOING FULL JUMPING JACK LIKE REALLY EXTENDING YOUR LEGS REALLY GETTING ARMS OVERHEAD AND REALLY DOING THE FULL MOVEMENT BY TINE YOU HIT FIVE OR SIX MINUTES YOU ARE GOING TO BE SWEATING AND YOU ARE YOUR HART RATE IS REALLY GOING TO BE UP I ALSO SOMENICE WI'LL TRAVEL WITH A JUMP ROPE I ALWAYS TRYING TRAVEL WITH THE JUMP ROPE AND SKIP ROPE IM MUCH TO THE DISMAY OF THE PEOPLE WERE HOUSE BELOW ME IN THE HOTEL ROOM SKIPPING ROPE I SHOULD MENTION CAN BE A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY OF GETTING CARTY VASCULAR TRAINING WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD BUT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS IF YOU'RE IN A HOTEL RUMER AN APARTMENT AND YOU CAN'T REALLY JUMP HIGH AND YOU'RE VERY GOOD AT JUMPING ROPE WHAT YOU'LL FIND IS IT'S NOCKIN TA GET YOU INTO THAT HIE ELEVATED HEART RATE ZONE GAG CAN BE GREAT FOR ZONE TOO TIGHT TRAINING BUT IF YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT SKIPPING ROPE AND I WOULDN'T SAY I'M REALLY GOOD AT IF UT I'VE DONE ENOUGH SKIPPING ROPE THAT I CAN JUST CONT OF CRUISE AND TALK AND ITT'S MORE ZONE TOOISH YOUVEN FEELS LIKE WALKING AT TIMES NOW YOU CAN D DOUBLE UNDERS WHERE YOU YOU'RE REALLY JUMPING AND AND PUTTING THE ROPE UNDER YOU TWICE EACH T IME OR CROSS OVERS ET CETERA DEPENDING ON YOUR SKILL LEVEL BUT AGAIN IF YOU'RE IN AN APARTMENT IEO'RE IN A HOTEL THATSKAN BE HARDER TO DO AND BECAUSE OF THERE'S SOME SKILL INVOLVED SOMETIMES YOUR STOPPING MORE OFTEN THAN YOUR CONTINUING A BY THE WAY AND I I JUST HAVE TO MENTION THIS A REALLY TERIFIC INSTRGRAM CHANNEL IS ANNA SKIPS THIS IS A TEACHER A SCIENCE TEACHER OR I BELIEVE IT'S A MATH MATHS AS THEY SAY IN THE YOUCET CASE SHE'S IN THE OUCATE MAT'S TEACHER I DON'T KNOW ANNA BUT I KNOW SHE SKIPS CAUSE SHE HAS THIS AMAZING INSTROGRAM CHALL CALLED ANNA SKIPS WHAT'S REALLY COOL ABOUT HER INSTERGRAMA SHE SHOWS YOU HER PROGRESSION FROM NOT BEING ABLE TO SKIP ROPE AT ALL TO THE ABSOLUTE INCREDIBLE TYPES OF A ROPE SKIPPING THAT SHE'S DOING EACH MORNING WHILE GETTING SUNLIGHT WHICH OF COURSE IS A ESSENTIAL HEALTH PROTO CALL TO CHICK OUT ANNA SKIPS ON INSTROGRAM REALLY INSPIRING AND A MADE ME WANT TO GET BETTER AT SKIPPING ROPE AND STILL WORKING AT IT O KESSTO WITH THAT THURSDAY CARDY OFVASCULAR LET'S CALL IT IN DURANCE BUT CARDY OF ASCULAR TRAINING WORK OUT DONE AROUND ROLLS FRIDAY AND ON FRIDAY I'M GOING TO DO ANOTHER CARDY OFVASCULAR TRAINING SESSION ND I LUDED TO THIS EARLIER BUT THIS CARDY VASCULAR TRAINING SESSION IS ALSO DESIGN TO TAP INTO SOME OF THE ABILITY OF HARD I SHOULD SAY HIGH INTENSA INTERVAL TRAINING TO TAP INTO STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY INCREASES FOR THE LEGS CAUSE REMEMBER WE TRAIN LEGS ON MONDAY AND WHAT THE SCIENCE TELLS US IS THAT PROTINE SYNTHESIS IN A MUSCLE GROUP CAN BE STIMULATED ABOUT EVERY FORTY TO TO SEVENTY TWO HOURS AND SO WE'VE HAD TUESDAY OFF WEDNESDAY OFF AND THURSDAY OFF AND YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE PROGRESS THAT YOU MADE FROM THAT TERRIFIC MONDAY LEG WORK OUT BUT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN DO THE OTHER THINGS THAT FOLLOW IN THIS PROGRAM AND PICKBACK UP ON MONDAY WITH ANOTHER LEG WORK OUT AT LEAST FOR ME WITH MY RECOVERY ABILITIES IN MY WORK SCEDUAL I'M NOT GOING TO DO AN ENTIRE OTHER LEG WORK OUT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO SET THE WHOLE THING OUT OF WACK THAT IS I WON'T BE ABLE TO CONSISTENTLY DO THE SAME WORK OUTS ON THE SAME DAYS OF EACH WEEK NOW WITH THAT SAID A LIIBIT LATER ALL EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU HAVE TO MISSA WORK OUT AND HOW YOU CAN COMBINE DAYS ET CETERA BUT I REALLY STRIVE TO GET CERTAIN WORK OUT'S DONE ON CERTAIN DAYS CONSISTENTLY AT LEAST AS BEST I CAN SO FRIDAY'S HI INTENS A INTERVAL TRAINING THAT CAN TAKE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT FORMS FOR ME THE IDEAL THING TO DO FOR ME AGAIN YOU COULD DO SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EXERCISE CHOICE AGAIN SHOULD BE GOVERNED BY WHAT YOU CAN DO SAFELY SEOU DON'T INJURE YOURSELF AND THAT YOU CAN PERFORM EFFECTIVELY AND THAN GETS YO OR PROVIDE YOU THE STIMULUS THAT YOU WANT AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO ON FRIDAY IS GET MY HEARTRAHT WAY WAY UP TALKED ABOUT THIS IN THE EPISODE WITH DOCTOR AINTY GALPIN IN ADDITION TO THE BENEFITS OF GETTING A HUNDRE AD EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED MINUTES OF ZONE TO CARDIO PER WEEK MINIMUM IT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA TO GET UP TO THAT MAX OR NEAR MAX HEART RATE AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK AND YOU'RENOT GOINGTO DO THAT FOR VERY LONG PERIODS OF TIMEYOUN I CAN DO THAT FOR THIRTY MINUTESYOU CAN'T SPRINT ALL OUT FOR THIRTY MINUTES UNLESS YOUR STEEVE PREFONTANE HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIES WITHOUT LIMITS OR PREFONTANE YOU SHOULD ABSALLY SEE THOSE HE WAS ABLE TO YOU KNOW GO OUT AND RUN TWELVE LAPS WHAT SEEM TO BE AN ALL OUT SPRINT OR CLOSE TO IT INCREDIBLE BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO DO THAT UM OR ARE GOING TO BE  CARRIED AWAY ON A STRETCHURE IF THEY TRY THESE HINTENTS THE INTERVAL TRAINING FOR ME IDEALLYT WOULD BE ON SO CALL A SALT BIKE OR AIR DINE BIKE SO THES RIKES TO HAVE THE FAN WHICH UM MIGHT SEEM LIKE O YOU NOW JUST COOLS YOU OFF BUT IS HEU THERE'S A LOT OF RESISTANCE THERE SO WHAT OUT I WILL TYPICALLY DO IS A TWENTY TO THIRTY SECOND ALL OUT SPRINT USING ARMS AND LEGS AND THEN TEN SECONDS REST AND THEN REPEAT ALL OUT SPRINT FOR TWENTY A THIRTY SECONDS TEN SECONDS REST REPEAT AND I'LL DO THAT FOR ANYWHERE FROM EIGHT TO TWELVE ROUNDS WHICH TRUST ME EVEN IF YOU START OUT A LITTLE IT LESS ER I SOULSAY NOT ALL OUT INTENSITY OR EFFORT BY TIME YOU HIT THE FIFTH OR SIX ONE YOU WILL BE CERTAINLY HEADED INTO IF NOT A NEAR YOUR MAXIMUM HEARTRAHT NOW WHAT IS YOUR MAXIMUM HARTRAHT DO YOU NEED A HARTRATE MONITOR NO IF YOU'D LIKE USING THAT SORT OF THING GREAT BUT AGAIN ANDY GALPAN BEAUTIFULLY SUPPLIED US WITH THE INFORMATION HE SAID I YOU TAKE THE UMBER TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY N YOU SUBTRACT YOUR AGE THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE MOST IS GOING TO BE YOUR MAXIMUM HEARTWRAHT ALTHOUGH FOR CERTAIN PEOPL WHO ARE VERY FIT OR CERTAIN AGES THAT'S NOT GOING TO APPLY SO IT'S LITTLE BIT TOO CRUDE A MEASURE BUT IT'S A GOOD STARTING PLACE AND YU CAN LOOK UP OTHER INFORMATION OR SEE THAT PODCAST EPISODE WE PRIE TO LINK TO IT IN THE SHOWNO CAPTIONS F YOU WANTO GET MORE DETAILS ON THAT I DON'T USE A HARTRAY MONEER WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS GET TO THAT POINT WHERE I QUOTEN QUOTE FEEL LIKE I WANT TO DIE NOW I DON'T WANT TO DIE AND PLEASE DON'T DIE RIGHT IF YOU'RE NOT IN GOOD CARTY OF VASCULATE HEALTH DO NOT JUST JUMP RIGHT INTO THIS FITNESS PRO TO CALL BUT I WANTO GET TO THE POINT WHERE I REALLY FEEL LIKE I COULD NOT PENDLE ANY FASTER OR PULL ANY FASTER ON THE ON THE ASSALT BIKE THE AIR DONE BIKE OR IF I'M DOING THIS WORK OUT IN A PLACE OR AT A TIME OR BECAUSE I CHOOSE TO NOT USE A BIKE OR A ROWER CAUSE YOU COUL ALL SEE IS A ROWER I WILL SIMPLY DO SPRINT JOG INTERVALS I WILL SPRINT FOR TWENTY OR THIRTY SECONDS THEN JOG FOR TEN SECONDS SPRIN FOR TWENTY R THIRTY SECONDS AN THE JOG FOR FOR TEN SECONDS AND JUST REPEAT I YOU'S HAVE A BIG FIELD NEXT TO MY LABORATORY MY OLD LABORATORY AND YOU SO PRING MY BULL DOG COSTILE OUT THERE HE WAS REALLY GOOD AT THE FIRST SPRINT PART AND THE G IS LIE DOWN AND WATCH HEU DIDN' EVEN DO THE JOG PART I WOULD UST GO BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH PANTING LIKE A BULL DOG NON STOP BARELY ABLE TO RECOVER BEFORE SPRINTING AGAIN AND THE BASIS OF THIS WORK OUT AGAIN IS SEVERAAL FIRST OF ALL IT'S TO GET THE HEARTRAT REALLY HIGH UP TOWARDS MAXIMUM HEARTRAHT AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK S YOU COMPLISH THAT THIS FRIDAY ALSO IF YOU ARE SPRINTING AND THEN JOGGING OR YOU ARE REALLY PUSHING HARD ON AN ASSALT BIHTER AN AIR DINE BIKE WE'RE USING A FOR INSTANCE A SKEER OR THE SKEAR MACHINE WHERE ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CARTY OF ASCULAR UM TRAINING TOOLS YOU ARE GOING TO GET ACTIVATION OF THE LEGS OF COURSE NOT TO THE SAME DEGREE AS YOU WOULD WITH SQUATS OR DEAD LESS OR LEG EXTENSIONS AND LEG CURLS THAT' SIMPLY NOT THE CASE BUT YOU'RE GOING TO TRIGGER STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHE AND OTHER TYPES OF ADAPTATIONS IN THOSE MUSCLE GROUP SO THIS FOR ME ALSO REPRESENT THE SECOND LEG WORK OUT OF THE WEEK WHERE I'M NOT TOUCHING ANY WEIGHTS ONE IMPORTANT POINT THAT I DON'T THINK I'VE HEARD MENTION ANYWHERE ELSE BUT THAT I HOPE TO HAVE DOCTOR KELLY STARRETT ON THE PODCAST TO DISCUSSIND THAT I'VE DISCUSSED WITH HIM A ONE ON ONE WHICH IS BE CAREFUL WITH ALL OUT SPRINTS OR ALL OUT ANYTHING CARTY OF ASCULAR EXERCISE YOU CAN GET INJURED DOING THOSE SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU GO OUT AN YOU JUST SPRINT ACROSS A FIELD ALL OUT TWENTY OR THIRTY SECONDS AND THEN WALK BACK AND CAN DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN DON'T BE SURPRISED IF THE NEXT DAY YOU HAVE SOME SIATICA OR EVEN SOME PELVIC FLOOR PAIN I DON'T RECOMMEND GOING ALL OUT ON ANY MOVEMENT THAT YOU CAN'T PERFORM WITH PERFECT FORM MOCASO FOR ME I REALLY TRY AND STAY AWAY FROM ALL OUT SPRINTS I'LL SPRINTED ABOUT NINETY FIVE PER CENT OF WHAT I CAN DO BECAUSE I FIND IF I GO ALL OUT SPRINT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REASON IS BUT IT MIGHT BE AN OVER EXTENSION OF A LIMB OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I'M NOT A SPRINTER I'M NOT A SPRINTING COACH I DO HOPE TO GET STUMAC MILLIN ON HERE OR OM AN FALF THERE EXCELLENT SPRINTING COACHES AT SOME POINT THEIR WIRL CLASS SPRINTING COACHES BUT I'M NOT A PRO SPRINTER I'M NOT EVEN A AMATEUR SPRINTER I MAY A FITNESS SPRINTER SO THE ERDINE OR ASSAULT BIKE OR THE ROWER IS REALLY A SAFE FER OPTION FOR ME AND IF I'M RUNNING OR I'M DOING SOME SORT OF MOVEMENT WHERE I'M UNCONSTRAINED REALLY IN TERMS OF HOW FAR MY STRIDE IS I MAN A OVOCY CONSTRAINED BY THE MUSCLETER I'M REALLY CAREFUL TO NOT OVER EXTEND OR DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE ONLY WAY TO DO THATS TO NOT GO ALL OUT SO AGAIN THE GO FOR THIS FRIDAY WORK OUT'S E REALLY GET THE HEART RAGHT HIGH DO HINDTENCSTHE INTERVAL TRAINING HER NUMBER DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CULD DO THAT YOU CAN LOOK UP H I I TE HIT WORK OUTS ON LINE FIND THE ONE THAT'S BEST FOR YOU AND REALLY PICKS SOMETHING THAT SAFE THAT YOU CAN DO CONSISTENTLY AND I BELIEVE THAT I DEALLY WILL ALSO TRIGGER A BIT OF EITHER STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHE AND SPEED POWER MAITENANCE OR EVEN GIVE YOU A LOBIT OF A STIMULUS SO THAT BY TIME YOU ROLL AROUND TO THAT LEG WORK OUT ON AGAIN ON MONDAY YOUVE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF AN ADDITIONAL BOOST TO YOUR LEGS STRENGTH HYPERTROPHE SPEED AND POWER SO WE'VE COVERED SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY AND THEN SATURDAY ROLLS AROUND AND SATURDAY IS WHEN YOU TRAIN ARMS CALVES AND NECK SO THIS MAY SOUND AS IF YOU'RE TRAINING A BUNCH OF SMALL MUSCLE GROUPS BICEPTS STRICEPTS NEXT AND CALVES AND THAT'S TRUE BUT I SHOULD MENTION THAT YOU ARE ALSO TRAINING YOUR TORSO A SECOND TIME AND YOU'RE DOING IT INDIRECTLY ER SOMETIMES NOT IT INDIRECTLY WHY DO I SAY THIS WELL KEEP IN MIND AGAIN THAT FOR STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHE YOU'RE GOING FOR THAT ONCE ABOUT EVERY FORTY EIGHT TO SEVENTY TWO HOURS YOU WANT A STIMULATE THAT ON WEDNESDAY IS WHEN YOU TRAINED YOUR TORSO RIGHT CHES SHOULDERS BACK AND NECK YOU'VE HAVE THURSDAY TO REST FRIDAY TO REST I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO ON TO EMPHASISE THOSE BODY PARTS THAN YOU THINK AWY YOU HAVE TO TRAIN IT TWICE A WEEK BUT IF YOU HAVE MODEST RECOVERY ABILITY WERE LOW RECOVERY ABILITY SUCH AS I DO AND YOUR DOING THESE OTHER CARDIVASCULAR TRAINING SESSIONS ET CETERA WILL THEN ON SATURDAY IS WHEN YOU WILL TRAIN ARMS CALVES AN NECK DIRECTLY BUT INCLUDED IN THAT REMEMBER TWO EXERCISES PER MUSCLE GROUP ONE WITH A PEAT CONTRACTION ONE WITH SOMEWHAT OF A STRETCHION THERE INCLUDED IN THAT I SUGGEST DOING SOME SORT OF DIP MOVEMENT WHICH I THINK IT WAS POVILSET SULINS AT THE DIP IS SYNONYMOUS WITH OR AT LEAST SIMILAR TO AN UPPER BODY SQUAT A EXCUSE ME PABLE IF I GOT THAT WRONG MAYBE IT WASN'T YOU THAT SAID THAT BUT O BIG ADMIRER OF HIS WORK AND CERTAINLY THE DIP IS A GREAT EXERCISE TO HIT MULTIBLE MUSCLE GROUPS IT CHES SHOULDERS AND TRICEPTS O MAYBEVEN SOME BACK TO SOME EXTEND DEPENDING ON HOW YOU DO IT SO DOING SOME DIPPING MOVEMENT WILL INDIRECTLY STIMULATE STRENGTH HYPERTROPHE ET CETERA IN THE CHEST AND SHOULDERS AND INCLUDING SOME SORT OF PULLING MOVEMENT FOR THE BICEPT LIKE A CHIN UP OR PALMS FACING MOVEMENT PULLING UP FROM TO THE BAR SPECIALLY IF ITS A CLOSE SCRIPT TIGHT MOVEMENT BUT EVEN IF IT'S A WIDE GRIP TIGHT MOVEMENT WILL OF COURSE TRIGGER STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHE MAINTENANCE OR IMPROVEMENTS IN THE BICEPS BUT WILL ALSO TRIGGER STRENGTH HYPERTROPHE IN THE LATS IN THE BACK OCAS SO SATURDAY IS THIS ARM WORK OUT THAT I'LL JUST GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A POTENTIAL WORK OUT WHERE YOU MIGHT DO A FEW MORE EXERCISE MAY BE NOT JUST TWO BUT MAY BE THREE TO MAKE TURE YOU GET THE TORSO INDIRECT STIMULATION SO WHAT WOULD THIS LOOK LIKE WELL THIS MIGHT BE YOUR SORT OF CLASSIC DUMBBELL CURLS FOR THE BICEPT AND MAYBE INCLING CURL FOR THE BICEP BECAUSE IT HAS MORE OF A STREPSO ON AN INCLINE BENCH AND THEN YOU MIGHT FINISH WITH TWO SETS OF CHIN UPS POPSO PAMS FACING YOU CHINNUPS OR THREE SETS OF CHINNUPS DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT YOU'RE IN A HEAVIER LOAD MON THROUGH A L OR MORE MODERATE WEIGHT MONTH AGAIN ACTIVEATING THE BICEPTS MUSCLES CASE ARMSDAY BUT ALSO ACTIVATING STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHE IN THE LATS OR AT LEAST MAINTAINING IT SO THAT BECAUSE YOUARE NOT TRAINING THOSE TORSELE MUSCLES AGAIN UNTIL WEDNESDAY YOU'RE NOT ALLOWING THE PRHYPERTROPHE AND STRENGTH GAINS THAT YOU GENERATED ON WEDNESDAY TO ATROPHE TO DISAPPEAR THEN THINKING ABOUT TRICEPTS IT MIGHT BE SOME SORT OF TRICEPTS ISOLATION OR PE CONTRACTION MOVEMENT SO THAT COULD BE TRIES UP KICK BACK OR ITSOM WHAT OVERHEAD EXTENSION WOULD BE MORE OF A STRETCHTIGHT MOVEMENT THAN A KICKBACK BUT THEN ALSO DOING REGULAR OLD DIPS YOU MGHT EVEN START WITH DIPS WHICH AGAIN ARE GOING TO ACTIVATE THOSE TORSO MUSCLES AND THE TRICEPTS AND THEN CALF WORK IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU DID ON MONDAY AND NECKWORK AGAIN I AM A BELIEVER IN TRAINING NECK MULTIBLE TIMES PER WEEK AN YOU ARE ABLE TO FINISH ALL OF THAT IN FORTY FIVE OR FIFTY MINUTES GREAT MOST PEOPLE WILL FIND WHEN YOU'RE DOING A LOT OF SMALL MUSCLE GROUPS ACTULLY TAKES LONGER BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GO ROUND TO MORE EXERCISES BUT AGAIN JUST ADHERE TO THE SAME PRINCIPLES WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE ABOUT FIFTY FIVES EROPE TO SIXTY MINUTES OF REAL WORK AFTER A WARM UP WITH AN ASTRICTS NEXT TO THAT THAT IF SOME ONE'S ON THE EQUIPMEN OR YOU CAN'T FIND THE DUNBELLS YOU NEED ET CETERA THEN MAYBE SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES MAX BUT REALLY TRYING TO NOT EXTEND THAT WORK OUT TOO LONG MAKING SURE THAT YOU ACTIVE ATE THE ARMS DIRECTLY BUT ALSO ACTIVATING THE TORSA MUSCLES INDIRECTLY AND AGAIN I WON'T REPEAT IT THIS TIME AGAIN BUT FALLWING THE SAME WAIT AND REPETITION AND REST INTERVAL SCHEME THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER A BIT HEAVIER LOWER REPTS MORE SETS AND LONGER REST FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND THEN ALTERNATING TO MORE REPETITIONS YET FEWER SETS SHORTER REST INTERVALS AND DO THAT FOR ABOUT A MONTH THIS CARRIES THROUGH FOR ALL THE RESISTANCE TRAINING WORK OUTS REGARDLESS OF THE DAY OF THE WEEK SO WEE COMPLETED THE TOTAL ARK ACROSS THE WEEK AND WE CAN SUMRISE IT AS SAYING SUNDAY IS LET'S JUS SAY LONG ENDURANCE MONDAY IS LEG RESISTANCE TRAINING TUESDAY HEAT COLD CONTRAST WEDNESDAY TORSO TRAINING PLUS NECK THURESDAY I WOULD CALL IT MODERATE INTENSIDY CARTY OF ASCULAR EXERCISE OF THAT THIRTY FIVE MINUTE MODERATE INTENSY CARTOF VASCULAR EXERCISE FRIDAY HIGH INTENSY INTERVAL TRAINING OF SPRINTING OR SOME A VARIATION THEREOF AND SATURDAY ARMSCALV'S NECK AND TORSO INDIRECT WORK THAT'S THE TOTAL STRUCTURE BUT I WANT TO EMPHASISE AGAIN YOU DO NOT NEED TO START THIS ON SUNDAY THAT IS YOU COULD MAKE THE LONG ENDURANCE WORK START ON TUESDAY AND THEN JUST FILL IN THE REST AS DESCRIBED BEFORE S REALLY UP TO YOU THERE'S ANOTHER IMPORTANTPOINT I WANT TO MAKE WHICH IS THAT NEITHER I NOR ANY ONE IS GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN DOING THE EXACT WORK OUT ON THE EXACT SAME DAYS OF EVERY WEEK BECAUSE OF TRAVEL WORK ILLNESS OTHER DEMANDS ET CETERA THE THING ABOUT THE SCETTU WA HATI LIKE SO MUCH O THAT I DO BELIEVE THAT WILL BENEFIT YOU AS WELL IS THAT YOU HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY THERE WHAT'S THE FLEXIBILITY WELL LET'S SAY YOU TRAIN YOUARE TYPICAL SUNDAY WORK OUT OF ENDURANCE THAN YOU TRAIN LEGS ON MONDAY AND THEN YOU DON'T MANAGE TO DO YOUR HEAT COLD CONTRAST ON TUESDAY FOR WHATEVER REASON WELL YOU CAN PUT IT ON WEDNESDAY JUST MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE COLD STIMULUS THAT YOU DON'T DO IT TOO CLOSE NOT WITHIN FOUR IDEALLY EIGHT HOURS AFTER THE TRAINING OF TORSO BUT YOU CULD DO IT BEFORE OR YOU COULD DO IT JUST HEAT AND SKIP THE COLD THAT PARTICULAR WEEK I NOT IDEAL BUT BETTER THAN NOT DOING ANYTHING LET'S SAY FOR INSTANCE THE LEG WORK OUT WAS PARTICULARLY BRUTAL Y DON'T SLEEP THAT WELL ON MONDAY NIGHT OR TUESDAY NIGH WELL THEN SHOULD YOU DO THE TORSO WORK OUT ON WEDNESDAY WELL I WOULD SAY WHY NOT MOVE THE HEAT COLD CONTRAST TIL WEDNESDAY AND THEN PUSH THAT TORSO WORK OUT TO THURESDAY AND MAY BE ALSO TRY AND DO THAT THIRTY FIVE MINUTE RUN ON THURSDAY EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE RATHER THEN LOSE THE TOTAL CONTROL OF PROGRAMM AND LET EVERYTHING SHUFFLE FORWARD HERE'S THE BASIC PRINCIPLE I DO BELIEVE THAT ANY ONE OF THESE WORK OUTS WHETHER IT'S FOR ENDURANCE ORE RESISTANCE TRAINING CAN BE SHIFTED EITHER ONE DAY FORWARD OR ONE DAY BACK RIGHT YOU COULD DELAY IT BY A DAY OR YOU COULD ACCELERATE IT BY A DAY IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET EVERYTHING DONE ACROSS THE WEEK IN FACT I WOULD SAY THE BEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS FOUNDATIONAL FITNESS BROGRAM IS NOT FROM THE DETAILS UP BUT FROM THE TOP DOWN FROM THE BIG PICTURE DOWN TO THE DETAILS AND SAY TO YOURSELF ONCE A WEEK YOU'REGING TO GET SOME LONG ENDURANCE IN ANOTHER DAY DURING THE WEEK YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT OU GET A KIND OF MODERATE FASTER ENDURANCE WORK OUT IN AND THEN ONE OTHER DAY TRAING THE WEEK YOU'RE GING TO GET IN ALL OUT SPRINT HIGH INTENSITY CARDY VASCULAR EXERCISE WORK OUT IT YOU'RE GOING TO GET THOSE THREE WORK OUTS IN SOMEHOW AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU WILL ALSO DO RESISTANCE TRAINING FOR EVERY MUSCLE GROUP IN YOUR BODY AND THAT MEANS DOING YOUR LEGS HARD AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK YOU'RE TORSO HARD AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK AND YOU'RE ARMS HARD AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK AND OF COURSE YOU ARE ALSO PAYING ATTENTION TO TRAIN YOUR CALVES AND I DO FOR REASONS I'D DESCRIBE BEFORE BELIEVE THAT YOU WANT TO TRAIN YOUR NECK AT LEAST TO KEEP IT STRONG YOU MAY NOT WANT TO GENERATE HYPERTROPHY THERE PEOPLE VERY IN TERMS OF HOW QUICKLY THERE NEK GROWS SOME PEOPLE GROWS VERY VERY FAST OTHER PEOPLE FOR THE LIFE THEM THAT CAN'T GET MUCH HYPERTROPHY IN THEIR NECK BUT KEEPING THAT NECT STRONG AT LEAST THROUGH SOME VERY LIGHT WORK TO MODERATE WEIGHT WORK VERY VERY IMPORTANT FOR REASONS I STATED EARLIER IF YOU SET OUT THOSE GOALS THEN THE SPECIFIC DAYS THAT YOU DO EACH WORK OUT ISN'T AS CRITICAL BUT THE SPECIFIC SPACING IS SO FOR INSTANCE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO DO YOUR HIGH INTENTS THE INTERVAL TRAINING THE DAY AFTER YOU TRAIN YOUR LEGS BECAUSE IF YOU'RE DOING THAT HIGH INTENTS THE INTERVAL TRAINING CORRECTLY YOU'RE GOING TO BE TAXING YOUR LEGS AND EATING INTO THEIR RECOVERY AND SO YOU WANT TA SPACE THEM OUT BY TWO OR THREE DAYS SO I THINK YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THE POINT IS REALLY TO OPTIMIZE EVERYTHING ON THE WHOLE RATHER THAN ANY ONE SPECIFIC ASPECT OF TRAINING YOUR ADAPTATION NOW THAT SAID I DO REALIZE THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE HYPER FOCUSSED ON THINGS LIKE STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY AND THE AESTHETICS THAT COME WITH IT A KEE POINT ABOUT STRENGTH HYPERTROPHY AND WEIGHT TRAINING AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN COVERED ON MULTIL PODCASTS CERTAINLY THE ONE WHICH EFF CAVALIER AND WITH IM DOCTOR ANY GALPIN IN THE ONE THAT I DID ON OM BUILDING MUSCLE STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY THE SOLO EPISODE AND THAT IS THE FOLLOWING IT IS THE RARE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS PERFECTLY BALANCED MUSCULATURE IGHT MOST PEOPLE CAN BE A BIT QUADOMINANT OR HAMSTRING DOMINANT OR THEY HAVE TROUBLE ACTIVATING THEIR GLUDES OR SOMEBODY HAS A TERRIBLE TIME TRYING TO ACTIVATE THE THERE CHESS MUSCLES BUT THERE VERY STRONG IN THE BACK ET CETERA IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT WE CAN NOW THAT NOT JUST BASED ON ESTHETICS RIGHT BUT BASED ON DELIBERATE CONTRACTABILITY OF THOSE MUSCLES SO I DONT AN TO GET INTO THIS AND TOO MUCH DETAIL FOR SAKE OF TIME BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS PURE VIEW TO RESEARCH TO SUPPORT IT AND WAS ALSO DISCUSSED EXTENSIVELY WITH JEFF CAVALIER WHEN HE WAS A GUESS AND THAT ASHALLY HEEDS REALLY POPULARIZE THIS NOTION AND ITS ABSOLUTELY TRUE WHICH IS THAT IF YOU CAN CONTRACT A MUSCLE VERY HARD TO THE POINT WERE IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE ITS CRAMPING IF YOU CAN DO THAT EVEN WHEN THERE'S NO WEIGHT IN YOUR HAND OR THERE'S NO RESISTANCE AGAINST IT SEE YOU JUST USING YOUR MIND MUSCLE CONNECTION TO CONTRACT THAT MUSCLE HEART AND ISOLATE IT CHANCES ARE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE HYPERTROPHY AND STRENGTH GAINS PRETTY EASILY IN THAT MUSCLE COMPARED TO MUSCLES THAT YOU HAVE A HARDER TIME ACTIVATING SO DURING ALL RESISTANCE TRAINING THAT MIND MUSCLE LINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT I SO MUCH SO THAT SOME PEOPLE WILL EVEN TRY AND EMPHASIZE CONTRACTION OF THE MUSCLES AND BETWEEN SETS ET CETERA I PERSONALLY BECAUSE I'M NOT SOMEBODY WHO I LIKE SOME MIRROR WHEN I WORK OUT AND I'M NOT SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO SPEND TIME IN BETWEEN SETS FLEXING MUSCLES AND ET CETERA A FOR WHATEVER REASON I WANT ACTUALLY REST BETWEEN SETS AND I'M MORE CONCERN WITH PERFORMANCE DURING THOSE SETS AND REALLY PUTTING MY MIND INTO THE MUSCLE DURING THE SET I REALLY TRYIN EMPHASIZE DEEP RELAXATION BETWEEN SETS AND SO HERE'S A A TOOL THAT AGAIN IS BUILT OUT OF SCIENCE AND I SHOULD SAY PUREVIEWED STUDIES SOME OF WHICH ARE BEING DONE IN MY LAB BUT OTHER LAVES AS WELL WHICH IS THAT IN BETWEEN SETS WHAT I REALLY STRIVE TO DO IS TO BRING MY HEART REIGHT DOWN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE CALM MYSELF DOWN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND O'L DO THE SO CLE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGH IN ORDER TO DO THAT THAT'S TWO INAILS THROUGH THE NOSE BACK TO BACK AND THEN LONG FULL AXHAIL THROUGH THE MOUTH ID JUST DID IT PARTIALLY THERE FIRST SAKE OF TIME AGAIN SO BIG DEEP INHAIL THROUGH THE NOSE AND THEN SNEAK IN A LITTLE BIT MORE ON A SECOND INHAL TO MAXIMILY INFLATE THE LUNGS IN THE EVIOLLY THE LUNGS AND THAN I FULL EXHAIL OF ALL YOUR AIR VI OF THE MOUTH TO EMPTY UR LUNGS THAT'S THE FASTEST WAY THAT WE ARE AWARE OF TO CALM YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM DOWN AND REALLY IN BETWEEN SETS YOU CAN USE THAT TO CALM YOURSELF DOWN AND CONSERVE ENERGY BUT THEN AS YOU MOVE INTO THE WEIGHT TRAINING SET YOU REALLY WANT TO RATCH IT UP YOUR FOCUS AND ATTENTION TO THE MUSCLES THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE USING NOW I LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THRE'S A HUGE RANGE OF PERAMETERS AN TERMS OF HOW TO ACTUALLY PERFORM DURING THE SET YOU CAN FOCUS ON A PARTICULAR MUSCLE AND TRY AND I'VE REALLY ISOLATE FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVEMENT SOME PEOPLE REALLY TRY AND ISOLATE IT ONLY DURIN THE P CONTRACTION SOME PEOPLE ACCENTUATE THE NEGATIVE THEIR SPEED AND CADENCS THERE ARE AGAIN REMEMBER CONSEPTS ARE FEW METHODS ARE MANY AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THE VARIOUS METHODS OF ECENTRICS AND CONCENTRICS AND ALL THE DFFERENT WAYS OF CHANGING UP CAYE INCE AND SO FORTH DURING SETS AS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF QUALITY INFORMATION OUT THERE FAR TOO MUCH FOR US TO GET INTO INTO DETAIL NOW BUT WHAT I DESCRIBE THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF HOW TO SET YOUR MIND IF YOU WILL DURING THE SET YOU SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON THE MUSCLES THAT YOURE USING AND OR MOVING THE WEIGHT IF MOVEMENT OF THE WEIGHT IS MORE IMPORTANT YOU CAN EITHER FOCUS ON MOVING THE WEIGHT OR CHALLENGING MUSLES RIGHT YOU CAN NEITHER TRY AN ISOLATE MUSCLES AND MAKE SPECIFIC MUSCLES DO THE WORK OR SIMPLY MOVING THE WEIGHT MOVING THE WEYH TO SIM IS GOING TO BE MORE GEARE TOWARDS STRENGTH IMPROVEMENTS BUT FOCASSING ON THE MUSCLES SO CALLE MY MUSCLE LINCINS GOING TO SHIFT THAT VERY SAME SET MORE TOWARD  HYPERTROPHY I REALIZE I'M PAINTING WITH A BROAD BRUSH HIERE BUT NONE THE LESS THIS IS GROUNDED IN THE WAY THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM GOVERNS MUSCULAR CONTRACTION AND WHILE I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT VARIABLES ASSOCIATE WITH RESISTANCE TRAINING YO SETS REPS REST INTERVALS CADENCE ET CETERA THER'RE ALSO A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF VERY IMPORTANT VARIABLES FOR ENDURANCE IN ANY KIND OF CARTEVASCULAR TRAINING AND THERE ARE A LOT OF EXCELLENT RESOURCES OUT THEREABOUT THAT THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE IN FACT I WILL GO ON RECORD SAYING WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLE FOR ANY ENDURANCE ORE CAUGHT EVASCULAR TRAINING IS THAT BECAUSE IT'S A REPETITIVE MOVEMENT THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE MOVEMENT SAFELY MEANING YOU'RE NOT PUTTING YOUR BODY IN TO RANGE OF MOTION OR INTO POSITIONS THAT CAN DAMAGE JOINTS ARE PUT YOU IN ANY KIND OF COMPROMISED STATE AND SOME HNGOW MY THING WHE THAT SEEMS KIND OF SILLY BUT IF YOU'VE EVER SET THAT FOR INSTANCE THE SEAT TOO HIGH ON A STATIONARY BYKE AND THEN DONE YOU KNOW AER DINE OR ASSAULT BITE TYPE A INTERVAL TRAINING SPRINTS IF IT' SET TOO HIGH AND YOU'RE OVER STRIDING AS IT WERE THE NEXT DAY YOU CAN REALLY PAY THE PRICE IN TERMS OF SOME BACK PAIN OR SIATICA AND SOMETIMES THAT PAIN CAN EXTEND FOR FOR QUITE A WHILE SO OF COURSE YOU DON'T WANT TO APPROACH ANY EXERCISE WITH SO MUCH CAUTION THAT IT'S NARADIC AND PREVENTIVE AND YET YOU DON'T WANT TO APPROACH ANY EXERCISE IN ANY WAY THAT'S SO CAVALIER FORGIVE THE PUN JEFF THAT YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO COMPROMISE YOUR THE INTEGRITY OF YOUR JOINTS IN MUSCULAR TURE AN CONNECTIVE TISSUE LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME REAL WORLD PRACTICAL VARIABLES FOR INSTANCE LET'S SAY YOU GET A POOR TO TERRIBLE NIGHT SLEEP SHOULD YOU TRAIN THE NEXT DAY OR NOT WIT THAT REALLY DEPENDS I CAN HONESTLY SAY I'VE HAD SOME OF THE BEST TRAINING SESSIONS RESISTANCE TRAINING OR ENDURANCE TRAINING SESSIONS AFTER A REALLY POOR NIGHT SLEEP BUT THAT'S THE RARER EVENT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IF IM NOT SLEEPING WELL I'VE HAD A TERRIBLE NIGHT SLEEP THE NEXT DAY I WILL JUST SKIP TRAINING THAT DAY I KNOW THAT WILL SHOCK A NUMBER OF YOU OUT THERE OR PERHAPS YOU'REALREADY CALLING ME NAMES WEAK ET CETERA BUT I FIND THAT IF I'VE SLEPT REALLY POORLY OR I'VE HAD A VERY STRESSFUL EVENT THE DAY BEFORE AND I DON'T SLEEP WELL TRAINING THE NEXT DAY SETS ME UP FOR GETTING ILL AND GETTING ILL SETS ME UP FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO TRAIN FOR MULTIPLE DAYS SO IT IS MY PREFERENCE IN THAT CASE TO SKIP A DAY AND REALLY FOCUS ON RECOVERY AND THEN AS I MENTION EARLIER SLIE THAT WORK OUT TO THE NEXT DAY AND RARELY DOUBLE THAT WORK OUT UP WITH ANOTHER WORK OUT BUT THEN JUST SLIDE THE SCHEDULE FORWARD BY A DAY BUT I REALLY TRY AND STRIVE THAT IS I REALLY TRY TO DOUBLE UP AT LEAST SOME WORK OUTS LATER IN THE WEEK IN THAT CASE SO THAT I CAN GET BACK ON SCHEDULE OF STARTING THE SEVENDAY PROTOCAL AGAIN ON THE SAME DAY I DON'T WANT TO BE EXCESSIVELY VAGUE THERE WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS I TRYING AT HERE TO THE SAME SCHEDULE BUT IF I G T A POOR NIGHT SLEEP I'LL JUST SIMPLY SKIP THE WORK OUT THE NEXT DAY SLIDE THE WORK OUT FORWARD THERE IS ONE EXCEPTION TO THAT AND IT'S AN IM PORTANT EXCEPTION WHICH IS THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I'VE NOT SLEPT WELL OR IHAVE HAD SOME PARTICULARLY STRESSFUL EVENT THE DAY BEFORE AND HAVEN'T SLEPT WELL BUT I'M ABLE TO DO SO CALLED AND ST AR NON SLEEP DEEP REST THE NEXT DAY SO THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES ENI'VE ONLY AT THREE OR FOUR HOURS OF SLEEP THE NIGHT BEFORE AND I'M FEELING I REALLY BEHIND THE BALL THE NEXT MORNING I REALLY WANT TO GET MY WORK OUT IN SO INSTEAD WHAT I WILL DO IS A TEN BUT IDEALLY IN THAT CASE A THIRTY OR EVEN SIXTY MINUTES NON SLEEP DEEP REST AND THERE'S A TEN MINUTE NON SLEEP DEEP REST PROTOCAL AREAD BY ME AM BUT IT IS A NON SPIRITUAL NON MISTICAL SCIENCE SUPPORTED NON SLEEP DEEP RESTPROTOCAL VAILBLE ON YOU TOO BE CAN SIMPLY PUT MY NAME HUBERMEN PUT AN ST R AND VIRTUE SAN V I R T S A N INTO YOU TWOBEN YOU'LL FIND THAT SCRIPT THERE ARE OTHER AND ST AR SCRIPTS THAT YOU CAN FIND NOW ON SPOTIFY AND ON YOU TO AND IF YOU FALL ASLEEP DURING THOSE NON SLEEP DEEP RESTSCRIPTS THAT'S GREAT AND IF YOU DON'T YOU WILL ALSO FIND THAT IT WILL RESTORE YOUR ABILITY TO PERFORM MENTAL AND PHYSICAL WORK SO THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I HAVEN'T IAS MUCH SLEEP AS I WOULD LIKE OR I'M FEELING IT A BIT MORE STRESSED FOR WHATEVER REASOND AND I'LL DO AN EST RE AND THEN I WILL GO TRAIN AND THAT OFTEN WORKS FABULOUSLY WELL FOR ME AND THEN I DON'T HAVE TO SKIP A WORK OUT ENTIRELY JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK WHETHER OR NOT YOU SHOULD TRAIN FASTED OR FED AND THIS IS A VERY CONTROVERSIAL AREA I PERSONALLY PREFER TO DO MY CARTY OF ASCULAR WORK NOT HAVING EATEN ANYTHING IN THE PREVIOUS THREE TO TEN HOURS AND TYPICALLY THAT'S BECAUSE I WAKE UP AND I'LL DO THE CART OF ASCULAR TRAINING WITHIN ABOUT AN HOUR OF WAKING UP SOMETIMES LATER BECAUSE OT MY FIRST MEAL GENERALLY FALLS GENERALLY NOT ALWAYS FALLS AROUND ELEVEN A M I DON'T DO ANY KIND OF FORMAL INTERMEN FASTING BUT TYPICALLY MY MEAL SCHEDUAL SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ELEVEN A M AND MY LAST BITE OF FOOD IS AROUND EIGHT P M BUT I'M NOT SUPERSTRICT ABOUT THAT I MIGHT EAT IT  ON'S LATEST NINE P M AND I MIGHT EAT SOMETHING AT TEN A M IF I WAKE UP REALLY HUNGRY AM I HAVE SOMETHING BEFORE ELEVEN A M I'M NOT NARADIC ABOUT IT BUT IN TERMS OF TRAINING I LIKE TO TRAIN FASTED AND THAT INCLUDES THE RESISTANCE TRAINING WORK OUTS AND THOSE COME EARLY IN THE DAY FOR ME AND TYPICALLY IF I'M GOING TO TRAIN LEGS ON MONEDAY FOR INSTANCE WHICH IS WHEN I TRAIN LEGS I'LL MAKE SURE THAT THE IGHT BEFORE I'M INJESTING SOME STARCH SOME CARBOHYDRATE RICE OR POSTOR OR SOMETHING ON THAT SORT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN I DO THAT MORNING LEG WORK OUT I HAVE ENOUGH LICAGEN IN THE MUSCLES ET CETERA AGAIN NUTRITION IS A SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSIAL AREA IN FACT A IT CAN EVOKE VERY STRONG FEELINGS AS I KNOW WE'VE GOT VIGANS AND WE'VE GT OMNIVORS AND WE'VE GOT CARNIVORS AND PEOPLE A REQITO THIS ISN' REALLY THE FORMAT FOR US TO GET INT ALL OF THAT I THINK THE RULE TO FOLLOW IS FIGURE OUT WHAT OPTIMIZES YOUR TRAINING FOR YOUR PARTICULAR TRAINING GOLLS FOR ME THAT MOST OFTEN MEANS TRAINING FASTED AND THEN EATING PRETTY SOON AFTER I TRAIN AND IF IT'S A HIGH INTENSITY RESISTANCE TRAINING WORK OUT AND FRANKLY ALL MY RESISTANCE TRAINING WORK OUTS AP PRETTY HIGH INTENSITY I'M NOT GOING TO FAILURE ON EVERY SET BUT AT LEAST THEY BOUT THIRTY PER CENT OF THOSE SETS I'M GOING TO FAILURE AND THE OTHER SETS HM WORKING VERY HARD NONE THE LESS WELL THEN I EAT SOME STARCHES AFTER I TRAIN AND I ALSO INJEST SOME PPROACHING IN THE FORM OF APPROACHING DRAINK OR A MEAL THAT INCLUDE SOME PROACHING FOOD BUT I DON'T LIKE TO EAT BEFORE I DO RESISTANCE TRAIN OUOR NOT ERE AT LEAST NOT WITHIN THE HOUR OR TWO BEFORE I DO RE SISTANCE TRAINING THEIR EXCEPTIONS TO THAT AND I SHOULD SAY THAT THE SAME BASICALLY APPLIES TO ENDURANCE WORK IF I'M GOING HEAT OUT FOR RUN TO BEGLAD DON'T WANT MY BELLY FULL OF FOOD OR ANY FOOD AT ALL BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHERE I WAKE UP HUNGRY AND I VERY MUCH NEED TO EAT SOMETHING OR I HAVE SOMETHING SCHEDRAL SOCIALLY LIKE A BREAKFAST AND ILL NOW M HAVE THAT BREAKFAST AND THEN AN HOUR OR NINETY MINUTES LATER I'LL DO MY WORK OUT M BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I FINISH THE WORK OUT I AGAIN AM NOT NEURADICALLY ATTACHED TO TRAINING FASTED OR FED FOR ME FAST ED IS PREFERRED BUT IF I HAVE TO TRAIN FED BETTER TO TRAIN THAN TO NOT TRAIN AT ALL WE HAVEN'T TALK SO MUCH ABOUT FLEXIBILITY YET BUT WE DIDN'T ENTIRE EPISODE TO TH HUBERMAN LABPODCAST ON FLEXIBILITY AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CHECK OUT THAT EPISODE IF YOURE INTERESTED IN INCREASING YOUR FLEXIBILITY BUT THE BASIC TAKE AWAY FROM THAT EPISODE IS THAT IF YOU LOOK IT WHAT I LIKE TO CALL THE CENTER OF MASS OF THE RESEARCH THAT IS MOST OF THE STUDIES AND WHAT THE CONCLUSIONS OF MOST OF THE CUALITY STUDIES POINT TO SO NOT THE EXCEPTIONS BUT THE KIND OF GENERAL RULES THAT HAVE BEEN GLEANED OVER TIME FROM MULTIBLE LABS OVER MULTIBLE DECADES ET CETERA WELL YOU FIND IS THAT STATIC STRETCHING THAT IS HOLDING A STRETCH AND IN FACT EXHAILING AND RELAXING THE MIDSECTION AND TORSO AND RELAXING INTO THE STRETCH HAS SUPPOSED TO STAYING FULL OF AIR AND TENSS BUT MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY RELAXING INTO THE STRETCH BUT NOT STRETCHING MAXIMALLY THAT IS NOT EXTENDING AS FAR AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN GO BUT MORE LIKE SIXTY PER CENT OR EVEN LESS AND THEN HOLDING THOSE STATIC STRETCHES FOR ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY TO SIXTY SECONDS AND THEN REPEATING DOING THAT TWO OR THREE TIMES THROUGHOUT THE WEEK FOR MULTILE MULCLE GROUP SO COULD BE FR QUADRACEPS COULD BE RAMS TRAINGS FOR YOUR LATS THEIR PROTOCALLS OUT THEREIN FACT WE HAVE A NEWS LETTER THAT IS FOCAST ENTIRELY ON PROTOCALS FOR FLEXIBILITY AND STRETCHING YOU CAN FIND THAT AGAIN BY GOING CUBERMAN LAB DOT CALM YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO SIGN OP FOR THE NEWS LETTER ALTHOUGH WE INVITE YOU TO IF YOU LIKE BUT YOU CAN  SIMPLY GO THERE SCROLL DOWN TO THE FLEXIBILITY NEWS LETTER AND ALL THE PROTOCALS ARE THERE FOR EACH OF THE MUSCLE GROUPS ET CETERA BUT WHAT I TYPICALLY TRY AND DO IS SOME STRETCHING IN THE EVENING BECAUSE I TRAIN IN THE MORNING AS I'M PERHAPS GETTING READY FOR BED OR IF THE TEVY IS ON WHICH IN OUR HOUSE DOESN'T TYPICALLY A GO ON BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A TEVY BUT OF COURSE THEYARE COMPUTERS AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE ON THEIR COMPUTERS ET CETERA WELL I'LL TRY AND DO SOME STRETCHING WHILE I DO THAT I'LL HAVE A STANDING DESK SO DURING THE DAY AT WORK REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOGHT I TRAIN THAT MORNING OR NOT ORE OMIN TO TRAIN IN THE AFTERNOON I'LL TRY AND DO SOME STATIC STRETCHI MY HANSTRINGS MY CUADS MY LATS MY SHOULDER IS MY BACK REALLY DOESN'T TAKE MUCH TIME AND I REALLY TRYN TO SPACE THAT OUT THROUGHOUT THE WEAK WHITCH IF YOU LOOK AT THE PUREVIEWED RESEARCH MACHES WELL TO WHAT'S KNOWN TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE WHICH ARE GOING TO BE SHORT REPEATED SECTIONS IDEALLY EVERY DAY BUT TRUTHTOLD I FAIL I CATEGORICALLY FIL I WAS ABOUT TO THINK OF WHETHER NOT I EVER STRETCH EVERYDAY I FAIL TO DO IT EVERY DAY BUT I GET ABOUT THREE OR SO STRECTING SECTIONS IN PER WEAK AND AGAIN ITS JUSTATIC HOLD TRYING TO REALLY RELAX INTO THE STRETCH NOW THE RELAX INTO THE STRETCHES SOMETHING HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT IN MARSHAL ART CIRCLES AND POVLES AT SULAN HAS AN EXCELLENT BOOK ON STRECTION WE CAN PROVIDE A LINK TO THAT TALKS ABOUT THIS HAS A LOT TO DO WITH RELAXATION OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AN THE WAY THAT THE NERVES INTERVATE MUSCLES IN A LOU FOR STRETCH IF YOU WILL ALSO THE WAY THAT THE TENDONS AND LIGAMENTS ARE ARE ENERVADED BY NERVES THE CONVERSE IS ALSO TRUE AND HERE AGAIN THIS IS A PRINCIPLE THAT UNPOVELIS PUT FORCE I BELIEVE HE CALLS IT IRRADIATION MEANING IRRADIATING OUT OR EMANATING OUT FROM A SORCE WHICH IS THAT WHILE EXHAILING AND RELAXING THE TORSO THE MID SECTION SOME PEOPLE CALL THE CORES ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THAT TERN CAN FACILITATE RELAXATION AND STRECTION THROUGH A LARGER RANGE OF MOTION SO TOO CAN CONTRACTING THE CORE THE MIDSECTION OR GRIPING VERY TIGHTLY WITH THE FIST CAN FACILITATE MUSCULAR CONTRACTION BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM REHEAVILY I WE CAN EVEN SAY OVER REPRESENTS THE FISTS IN THE BRAIN AND SO HOW WOULD YOU APPLY THIS TO YOUR OVERALL A FOUNDATIONAL FITNESS PROTOCAL WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT LET'S SAY YOU'RE DOING A MOVEMENT THAT INVOLVES A ONE LIMB MOVING AND THEN THE OTHER TUT SAY IT'S BISEPT CURLS JUST FOR SAKE OF EXAMPLE TURNS OUT THAT YOU WILLAXLY BE STRONGER IN MOVING THAT DUMBBELL WITH THE ARM THAT HAPPENS TO BE MOVING IF YOU GRIP THE HANDLE VERY TIGHTLY BUT ALSO GRIP THE HANDLE OF THE OPPOSITE DUMBBELL VERY TIGHTLY OW THAT SAID IN BETWEEN SETS I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THE OPPOSITE TO TRYIN COMPLETELY RELAXIN BETWEEN SETS COMBINE THAT WITH THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGE AND THEND WHEN THE SET THE NEXT SET COMMENCES EMPLOY THAT VERY STRONG GRIP BOTH AGAIN OF THE OF THE WAGHT THAT'S MOVING IN THE AND THE WEIGHT THAT AT THAT MOMENT MIGHT BE STATIONARY OR AN ISYMMETRIC POSITION SO THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF COURSE IS WHAT CONTROLS MUSCLES AND THAT OPERATES IN BOTH DIRECTIONS IF YOU WANT TO RELAX TRYING USE LONG EXAILS MAY BE EEN PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE AND REALLY CONCENTRATE ON MENTALLY IN PHYSICALLY RELAXING IN PARTICULAR CORE AND YOUR FISTS AND IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE FORCE AND YOU WANT TO MOVE A HEAVY BAR BELL OR DUMBBELL YOU WANT TO DO IT CHIN UP WITH THE MAXIMAL FORCE THAT'S WHEN YOU CAN EMPLOY THE OPPOSITE WHICH OUD BE TO GRIP THE BAR OR DUMBBELL ET CETERA VERY TIGHTLY AND YOU WANT TO CONTRACT YOUR CORE OR EVEN FILL YOUR BODY WITH AIR AS I SAY PLUG ALL THE LEAKS ET CETERA SO THIS GETS INTO ONAFORM AND MOVEMENT ON WHICH IS AN EXTENSIVE AN ER INFINITE A A LANDSCAPE OF DISCUSSION AGAIN THAT WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO INTO JUST WANT TO MENTION THOSE TWO NERVOUS SYSTEM RELATED TIPS BECAUSE I SPPOSE IS A NERW SCIENTISTS THEY APPEAL TO ME BECAUSE THEY ARE GROUNDED IN FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM ENERVATES MUSCLE AND I KNOW THAT THEY WILL BENEFIT YOU THE FIRST TIME YOU USE THEM AND EVERY TIME SPEAKING OF GRIP AND NERVOUS SYSTEM AND FITNESS AND LONGEVITY DOCTOR PETER ATEA WHO'S A MEDICAL DOCTOR WAS A GUEST ON THE HUBORMAN LADPODCAST AND PROVIDED AN ENORMOUS WEALTH OF INFORMATION ON THAT PODCAST EPISODE I REALLY ENCURGE YOU TO CHECK IT OUT OW WHEN YOU HAVE TIME AND OF COURSE HAS HIS OWN SPECTACULAR POCAST THE DRIVE WITH PETER ATIA PETER DOCTOR ATI I SHOULD SAY OFTEN TALKS ABOUT CERTAIN MOVEMENTS WERE EXERCISES THAT YOU SHOULD PERFORM NOT JUST TO IMPROVE YOUR FITNESS BUT ALSO TO TOUCH IN TO OR MEASURE HOW FIT YOU ARE AND HOW WELL YOU ARE PROGRESSING TOWARD A LONG LIFE SPAND AND HEALTH SPAN AND ONE OF THOSE INCLUDES THE ABILITY TO HANG FROM A BAR FOR A MINUTE OR LONGER AND THERE ARE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS THAT ONE CAN HAVE OF HOW LONG THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANG FROM A BAR DEPENDING ON THEIR AGE AND THEI FITNESS LEVEL ET CETERA PLEASE CHECK OUT DOCTORITE IS PODCAST AND HIS VARY SOCIALMEDIASIGTS TO GET MORE INFORMATION ON THAT BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO HANG FROM A BAR AND YOU WAN O HANG FROM THAT BAR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE A INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT METRIC OF YOUR HEALTH THEN GRIPPING THE BAR VERY TIGHTLY WILL ACTUALLY HELP EARLIER WE TALKS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO TRAIN IF YOUR SLEEP DEPRIVED AND HOW TO RECOVER FROME WHAT I WOULD SAY IS MODERATE SLEEP DEPROVATION BY DOING ANNEST TI AR SUPPOSED TO TOTAL SLEEP DEPRVATION LIKE BEING UP ALL NIGHT OR HAVING A TRULY MISERABLE NIGHT WHICH CASE I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST SKIP TRAINING THE NEXT DAY AND SLIDE IT FORWARD NOW SIMILAR ISSUE COMES UP FROM TIME TO TIME WHERE PEOPLE WONDER WHETHEROR NOT THEY SHOULD TRAIN OR NOT IF THEY ARE SICK HERE THERE'S ALL SORTS OF CRAZY A GIM LORE AND SPORT SPECIFIC LORE A FOR INSTANCE A I USED TO HEAR THIS WHEN I RAN CROSS COUNTRY THERE WAS THIS ADAGE THAT IF THE SYMPTOMS WERE FROM THE NECK UP YOU COULD STILL TRAIN THAT IS IF YOU WERE REALLY CONGESTED AND YOU HAD A HEADACHE YOU COULD STILL RUN WHEREAS IF IT WAS IN YOUR CHEST IN YOUR LUNGS YOU COULDN'T RUN I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DATA ONSOEVER TO SUPPORT WHETHER NOT THAT'S TRUE OR WHETHER IT'S IT'S NOT TRUE FOR MYSELF AND BECAUSE O MY GENERAL GOAL IS TO BE TRAINING AND FIT OVER  TIME BUT ALSO TO INCLUDE GENERAL HEALTH IN THE FITNESS EQUATION THAT IS TO NOT BE SICK OR CHRONICALLY SICK AND CERTAINLY NOT TO GET OTHER PEOPLE SICK IF I HAVE A LITTLE TINY SNIFFLE I THINK I MIGHT BE GETTING SICK EVEN THEN I'M A LITTLE CAUTIOUS IN THE SENSE THAT I'M NOT GOING TO DO MY TYPICAL WORK OUT I MIGHT STOP IT ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES EARLIER AND I WOULD DO THAT NOT BY A NEGLECTING ANY BODY PARTS OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT IF ITS AWAIT TRAINING WORK OUT BY BY SIMPLY REDUCING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SETS I PROBABLY WOULDN'T DO ANY SETS TO FAILURE IF I DID MIGHT REDUCE THE TOTAL NUMBER OR PERCENTAGE OF SETS TO FAILURE FROM ABOUT THIRTY PER CENT OF SETS TO MAY BE CLOSER TO TEN PER CENT OF SETS SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND IF IT WAS ENDURANCE WORK I MIGHT THROTTLE BACK BY TEN OR TWENTY PERENT AND I WILL SHORTEN THE TOTAL DURATION OF THE WORK OUT AND I OFTEN FIND THAT BECAUSE OF THE KNOWN YES PURE REVIEWED KNOWN IMMUNE SYSTEM ENHANCING EFFECTS OF EXERCISE SOMETIMES THAT ALONE WILL ALLOW ME TO AVOID GETTING SICK BUT OF COURSE I'M ALSO CAREFUL TO GET HOME TAKE A HOT SHOWER NOT STRESS MYSELF OUT IF I CAN AVOID GETTING MYSELF STRESSED OUT IN FOCUS ON SLEEP AND ESTIAR OTHER FORMS OF RECOVERY GOOD NUTRITION ET CETERA IF HOWEVER I HAVE A REAL SNIFFLE A COLD I'M NOT FEELING WELL OR I THINK I MIHT BE COMING DOWN WITH A FLUE I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT TRAIN AND I DON'T GET BACK INTO TRAINING OF ANY KIND UNTIL I'M COMPLETELY RECOVERED SO WHAT I MASICALLY SAYING IS THAT NO I DON'T BELIEVE YOU SHOULD TRAIN IF YOU'RE SICK AND PERHAPS EQUALLY IMPORTANTLY WHEN YOU COME BACK FROM A LAY OFF OF ANY KIND WHETHER NOT BECAUSE OF ILLNESS OR FOR WHATEVER REASON I DO BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE YOUR BIDY IS A BIT UNTRAINED IT'S NOT IDEAL TO JUMP RIGHT BACK IN A MAXIMAL TRAINING AND TO TAKE ONE MAYBE TWO WEEKS OF RAMPING UP THE TO THE FULL DURATION AND INTENSITY OF WORKOUTS THAT THEN I WOULD CONTINUE ON GOING FOR HOWEVER MANY CYCLES I CAN COMPLETE BEFOR I HID ANOTHER SICKNESS OR I HID ANOTHER GAP IN MY SCHEDULL DO TO FAMILY OBLIGATIONS OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS ET CETERA SO WE'VE COVERED A LOT OF TOOLS AND PROTOCALS AND VARIABLES RELATED TO FITNESS BUT WE HAVE BY NO MEANS COVERED ALL THE AVAILABLE TOOLS AND PROTOCALLS AN HIBLES BEFORE WEU WRAP UP I DO WANT EMPHASIZE ONE TOOL IT'S A VERY EASY IN FACT ZERO COST VERY LOW TIME COMMITMENT TOOL AND THIS WAS ONE THAT WAS PROVIDED AGAIN BY DOCTOR ANTO GALPIN WHEN HE WAS ON THE HUVERMAN LABPODCAST AND IT'S A TOOL THAT THERE IS EXCELLENT RESEARCH TO SUPPORT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AND THAT I DO BELIEVE SHOULD COME AT THE END OF EVERY TRAINING SESSION AND THAT'S TO DO THREE TO FIVE MINUTES OF DELIBERATELY SLOW BREATHING IT SOUNDS SO SIMPLE THREE TO FIVE MINUTES OF DELIBERATELY SLOWED BREATHING SO THIS COULD BE WHILE YOU'R IN THE SHOWER OR WHEN YOU ARRIVE AT YOUR CAR YOU MIGHT SIT IN YOUR CAR QUIETLY AND DO THAT IF YOU HAVE TIME OR MAYBE EVEN WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING BAT TO OR ON TO YOUR NEXT AN DESTINATION JUST TO REALLY SLOW DOWN YOUR BREATHING TO REALLY LOOK AT THE RECOVERY PERIOD THAT HAS TO FOLLOW EACH TRAINING SESSION AND OF COURSE DURING WHICH THE ADAPTATIONS THE CHANGES THAT MAKE YOU MORE FIT THAN YOU WERE GOING INTO THE EXERCISE OCCUR AND THAT THREE TO FIVE MINUTES OF DELIBERATELY SLOW BREATHING HAS BEEN SHOWN INANDY'S CROUP AND IN RELATED EXPERIMENTS NOT EXACTLY SAM BUT RELATED EXPERIMENTS IN OUR LABORATORY IN ANOTHER LABORATORIES TO REALLY SO CALLE DOWN SHIFT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND REALLY SET YOU UP FOR MAXIMAL RECOVERY RAPID RECOVERY AND ALLOW YOU TO LEAN INTO THE NEXT TRAINING SESSION WITH LE INTENSITY WHEN THAT TRAINING CESSION EVENTUALLY ARRIVES SOTHS A VERY SIMPLE TOOL BUT A VERY POTENT TOOL FOR YOU'R OVERALL FITNESS SO THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME FOR THIS DISCUSSION OF WHAT I'M CALLING A FOUNDATIONAL ESS WE COULD EVEN GET BOLD AND CALL IT AN OPTIMAL FITNESS PROTOCALL THOUGH THE WORD OPTIMAL IS A TRICKY ONE HERE'S NO REAL OPTIMAL FITNESS PROTOCOLL AND TO DAY WHATD IVE REALLY TRY TO POCUS ON IS THIS FOUNDATIONAL PROTOCALL BECAUSE IT DOES ALLOW YOU TO CHECK OFF MOST IF NOT ALL THE BOXES RELATED TO STRENGTH ENDURANCE HYPERTROPHY SPEED POWER FLEXIBILITY YOU WILL ALSO TEACH YOU HOW TO REGULATE YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM UP AND DOWN THAT IS TO RAMPOP AND PHOCUS MINE MUSCLELINK ET CETERA AND THEN QUICKLY CALM DOWN PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE THREE TO FIVE MENUTE DECOMPRESS BREATHING AT THE END OF TRAINING ET CETERA REALLY EVEN THOUGH I TALKED ABOUT THE PROTOCALL THAT I FOLLOW AND AGAIN THAT WE WILL PROVIDE AS A NEWS LETTER AT HUBERMAN LABDOT COM IF YOU WANT T LOOK AT IT IN MORE DETAIL EVENTHOUGH WE TALKED ABOUT IT IN THE CONTECT OF WHAT I DO AGAIN I REALLY WANT EMPHISIZE THAT THIS PROTOCOL AND THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS PROTOCOL AND ALL ITS VARIABLES S REALLY FOR YOU AND FOR YOU TO TAILOR TO YOUR SPECIFIC NEEDS SO PLEASE TAKE THE PROTOCALL INTO CONSIDERATION BUT DO NOT TREAT IT AS WHOLLY TREATED AS A STARTING

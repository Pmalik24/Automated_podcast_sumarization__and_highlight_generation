SHE KNEW SHE WAS GONE AN EAT OR DAD LILYS DAD HIS FORMER AIR FORCE NOW HE WORKS IN IG TEE HE LODS MUSIC LILY LIKES TO DESCRIBE AS DAD ROCK ASY DYSEE BOUT JOVY HE WAS FIVE KIDS THREE BOYS IN TWO GIRLS HE GREW UP IN A CONSERVATIVE FAMLY BELEVING IT WAS WRONG TO HAVE IN ABORTION LILY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WOULD THINK ABOUT HER WANTING IN ABORTION I WAS JUST NERVOUS TO TELL HIM HONESTLY I WAS NERVOUS TO

SAID YOU KNOW HOW HARD THOT'S GOIN TO BEAIN OUT RIGHT LILY KNEW THEN HER DAD WALKED OUT HE SAID HE NEEDED A LITTLE TIME TO PROSSASS THAT INFORMATION LILY DECIDED IN HER HEAD THAT WHAT HER DAD WAS NOT SAYING WAS THAT HE WANTED HER TO KEEP THE BABY DIT WAS IT WAS IT WAS CUND OF HARD CAUSE LIKE I CAN HANDLE MY O BEING OUT OF ME HIM BEING DISPOINTING ME AS A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY WAS HE ACTUALLY DISAPPOINTED DID HE ACTUALLY NOT WANT HER TO GET THE ABORTION WHAT WAS HE THINKING WHEN THE DOCTOR TOLD THEM SHE WAS PREGNANT WHEN THE DROVE HOME THAT NIGHT WILY HADN'T ASKED HIM SO I DID THE THE FIRST THING WAS WHO IS THIS KID RIGHT BECAUSE THER'S THERE'S A BUTT KICKIN COME YOU MEAN WHO IT ON PERSON WHO IMPREGNATED HER YES YES AND WHEN SHE'S TOLD ME UM IT CONT OF INFURIATED ME A LITL MORE WHY WELL BECAUSE SO THE GUY HAD ALREADY HE WAS OT HE ALREADY GOT ANOTHER YOU LIKE FIFTEEN SIXT YEAR OLD GIRL PREGNENT AND HA A BABY WITH HER SO IES YES THEN THE NEXT THING IN MY MIND IS IM I'M CALLING THES THREE BROTHERS AND THIS IS GETTING HANDLED THAT THAT WAS THE IMMEDIATE YOU KNOW YOU'VE RUINED YOUR LICE UM YOU KNOW YOUR SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD YOU CAN HAVE A BABY NOW A HOW HOW  YOU GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THIS BABYOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A JOT NO I THINK SHE WAS WORKIN IT AT THAT POINT YOU WORK ING A JERSEY MIKES MAKING IN ON WAGE YOU KNOW I HAVE JUST GOTTEN OUT OF FINALLY PAYING OFF HER MEDICAL BILLS FOR YOUR BROKEN LEG WHICH WAS AUR ALSO THE RESULT OF A HORRIBLE DECISION ON YOUR PART WHAT WERE YOU THINKIN WHEN LILY TOLD HER DAD JUSTIN THAT SHE WANTED AN ABORTION SHE IMAGINED HE WAS ANGRY HER APS THAT BUT HE TOLD ME HE WASN'M HE WAS REALLY JUST SURPRISED UM I DIDN'T THINK KNOWING GRACE THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE AN OCTION FOR HER GRACE IS HIS NICKNAME FOR LILY HE'S ALWAYS CALLED HER THAT I DON'T KNOW WHY JUST THAT WAS MY FIRST INSTINCT WAS SHE'S GN HAVE HIS BABY I DO'T KNOW WHY I TOUGHT TI CAUS SHE I MEAN WHEN SHE TALKS ABOUT IT IT'S LIKE THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR THAT SO IT'S INTERESTING THAT KNOWING HER AS WELL AS YOU DO THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S CONTA WERE YOUR MIND WEN THIS DISMAY SOUND TERRIBLE BUT IT PROBABLY WAS A RESULT OF HOW NURTURING SHE IS YOU KNOW SHE DOESN'T LIKE TO STEP ON SPIDERS HE WONT OF SAYING SO  I JUST NEVER THOUGHT TI THAT THAT WOULD BE AN OCTION FOR HER BUT JUSTON QUICKLY MOVED PASS SHOCK AND INSACTION MUT HE ASSUMED THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT HE NEEDED TO MAKE HOPPEN FOR HIS DAUGHTER THE DAY LILY TOLD HIM SHE WANTED AN ABORTION JOSTON WENT TO WORK AND RESEARCH HE LOOKED UP CLENIX HE HAD NO IDEA THAT LILY BABY NOW H'S ANXIOUS AND SOMEWHAT IRRESPONSIBLE TEA NATUR SHE WAS WAT OUT OF HIM GENERALLY HEAR FROM HER MUCH THAT DAY AND I GET HOME FULLY SHE'S LAYING ON HER BED SHE'S GOT HER LITTLE NOTE BOOK OUT SHE'S GOT SOME KIND OF GANKS TO RAP GOING ON ON

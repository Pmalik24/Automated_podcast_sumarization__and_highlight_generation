WHO NEVER GOT ALONG WITH HIS BROODY LITTLE SISTER AND WHEN BOB FOUND OUT ABOUT MARTY FOUND OUT THAT SHE WAS HIS BIOLOGICAL SISTER HE CALLED HER RIGHT AWAY IN CALIFORNIA WHEN SHE GOT ON THE PHON I WAS

TALL ALWOL ALL OURS OT THE NIGHT TALKING FOR SUE HER BROTHERS ENTHUSIASM FOR MARTY BROUGHT OUT EVERY INSECURITY SHE SUFFERED AS A SCHOOL GIRL SHE DIDN'T FIT IN SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE SOCIAL LEAVSE THAT CAME SO NATURALLY TO BOB AND MARTY HE WAS POPULAR AND I WASN'T I WAS LIKE A SERIOUS PERSON NOBODY WOULD DANCE WITH ME AT THE DANCES AND I YOU KNOW I WANT HE HAD A BAND I MEAN I WAS SHY OR I WAS WHATEVER AND I WANTED TO BE A CHEER LATER I TRIED OUT FOR CHEERLING I JUST COULDN'T DO IT YOU KNOW I DIDN'T GET PICKED AS HEARS WENT BY WHEN THERE WERE FAMILY EVENTS WITH EVERYONE SUE WOULD GET ANXIOUS IF MARTY WAS THERE TOO OCCASIONALLY SHE'D BREAK DOWN IN CRY IE REMEMBER AT THE WEDDING WHEN MY NEPHEW GOT MARRIED MY BROTHER DANCED WITH EVERYBODY HE DANCE WITH MARTY AND YOU CAN SEE THAR JAS HAVEN SO MUCH FON AND LAUGHING TO GOTHER AND AND JUST DANCIN AWAY AND THEN HE DANCE WITH MY COUSIN HE DANCED WITH MY MOTHER HE DANCED WITHERE HE DIDN'T DANCE WITH ME AND HERE I AM YOU KNOCE LIKE OR MA TENA JER GAININ NOT WHAT HE DANCE WITH WIH ME NO WAT'S IT WAS BAD BUT THE BED GOOD PART ABOUT THAT WAS WHEN I GOT HOME FROM THE WEDDING AND MY BROTHER CALLED ME AND HE SAID YOU KNOW AT I DIDN'T EVEN

BROTHER GEN A CARE TO EVEN SEE ME ANY MORE THIS BRINGS US TO MARTY THE OTHER BABY IN THIS BABY SWITCH FOR SHE FOUND OUT THE TRUTH ABOUT WHO HER MOTHER REALLY WAS MARTY'S LIFE WASN'T ALL THAT DIFFERENT FROM SUES MARTY WAS ALSO MARRYD ALSO HAD THREE KIDS SHE'S ALSO MOVED OUT OF WISCONSIN IN HER CASE TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SHE'S ALSO RELIGIOUS LIKE SUE BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHERE IT ENDS MARTY WORKED ALL OF HER DULT LIFE AND STILL DOES AS A NURSE SHE GREW UP AS THE SIX CHILD IN A FAMILY OF SEVEN KIDS BESIDES HER THERE WAS MARY LYDIA FAITH RUTH SUNNY LUKE AND ESTER HER MOTHER RANT A DISCIPLINED HOUSEHOLD EVERYONE HAD TO WORK SHE REMEMBERS WASHING AND DRAWING ALL THE DISHES BY THE TIME SHE WAS FIVE OR SIX THERE WASN'T MUCH MONEY AROUND THE FIVE GIRLS SHARED ONE BEDROOM THE CHURCH WAS THE CENTER OF THEIR LIVES AND THE FAMILY NEVER WENT ON VACATION OR EVEN TO THE MOVYES INSTEAD THEY WERE ALL TAUGHT TO PAINT AND COURAGED PLAY MUSIC LIKE SO THOUGH MARTY STUCK OUT IN HER FAMILY FOR ONE THING SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO JOKED AROUND SHE SAYS EVEN NOW THE MILLERS CAN'T TELL WHEN SHE'S BEING IRONIC AD THE THERE WAS THE BLONDNESS IN THE PERKINESS IN THE SOCIALIZING MARTY SAI SHE FELT LIKE EVERYTHING SHE WAS INTERESTED IN WAS LOST ON HER PARENTS I DON'T THINK THAT THEY EVER CAME TO WATCH ME SHER AND AGAIN THAT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT THEY WOULD HAVE DONE CAUSE ATHLETICS WAS REALLY NOT A VALUE TO THEM AT ALL I WAS JUST NOT EVER MEETING THEIR EXPECTATION OF INTELLECTUALISM AND MY MOTHER HAS TOLD ME SINCE THEN YOU KNOW YOU I REALLY DIDN'T EXPECT THAT MUCH FROM ME BECAUSE I KNEW THAT YOU WEREN'T OR CHILD THAT WAS A HARD THING HERE INCREDIBLY WHEN MARTY WAS TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD SOME ONE ACTUALLY TOLD HER THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE A MILLER ONE OF HER OLDER SISTERS RUTH CAME TO VISIT WITH HER HUSBAND RUDY RUDY HAD A COUPLE OF YEARS AND AFTER DINNER HE GOT TO TALKING AND HE STARTED ASKING ME WHAT I KNEW ABOUT THE MC DONALDS AND I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE MC DONALD'S AND THEN HE TOLD ME THAT I LOOKED LIKE THEM AND HE SAID WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF I TOLD YOU THAT THEY WERE YOUR PARENTS ND I I WAS KIND OF STONNED IT WAS THE FIRST I HAD EVER HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND HE DID IN FACT AY SOME HURTFUL THINGS DOES HE TOLD ME YOU KNOW I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYBODY SAYS FROM AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED YOU'RE NOT REALLY RUTH'S SISTER I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST RUDY BEIN RUDY YOU KNOW HE JUST HAS CRAZY IDEAS AND HE DREAMS THESE THINGS UP I WAS JUST HORRIFIED AND AND HE DIDN'T TELL ME A HAD A TIME HE JUST CAME OUT WITH IT THAT'S RUTH SHE AND FAITH AN MARY LYDYA A THE OLDER GIRLS HAD SORTO ALWAYS KNOWN ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT MARTY WASN'T THEIR BIOLOGICAL SISTER  COUPLE OF THEM INCLUDING RUTH HAD VAGUE MEMORIES OF THEIR PARENTS TALKING ABOUT IT AFTER THEY BROUGHT MARTY HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL ABOUT HOW THIS BABY LOOKED DIFFERENT FROR MISSUS MILLER'S OTHER BABIES AND THAT MAYBE THIS BABY HAD BEEN SWITCHED THEN WHEN RUTH WAS ABOUT SIXTEEN HER OLDER SISTER FAITH CAME HOME FROM A TRIP ON A MISSISSIPPI RIVER BOAT AND TOLD RUTH SHEAD SEEN SOO MC DONALD ON THE BOAT AND THAT SHE LOOKED AN AWFUL LOT LIKE THEM THE DECIDED THAT RUTH OUGHT TO HAVE A LOOK TOO SO THE TWO GIRLS COOKED OP A RE CONNISTAN'S MISSION ON ONE SUNDAY THEY GOT THEIR BOY FRIENDS O DRIVE THEMIS SEVENTEEN MILES AWAY TO THE MCDONALD'S CHURCH AND PRAIRIE TO SHENE RUTH SAT DOWN IN A PU NIOR THE FRONT NEXT TO FAITH WRIGHT BEFORE THI SERVICE BEGAN SHE SAYS THERE IS SUE WALKING DOWN THE CENTR ILE AND KNOW I I THOUGHT SHE EVEN WALKS LIKE MARY YOU KNOW I WAYS I WAS JUST LIKE YOU WOLL YOU KNOW WELL THAT COULD BE THAT COULD BE HERD THAT COULD BE MY SISTER AND YET I THINK IT MIGHT BE AND AT ANY POINTERING THIS TIME DOES A CRUSTION IAM WELL WHYN'T WE JUST ASKED MAMMANDAT ABOUT THIS NOW THAT'S NOT HOW THEIR FAMILY WORK IT JUST DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THESE KINDS OF THINGS AND AS RUTH AND FAITH SAW IT IT WASN'T THEIR PLACE TO MESSIN THEIR PARENTS AFFAIRS WHICH WAS WHY WHEN HER HUSBAND RUDY BLURTED IT OUT A FEW YEARS LATER RUTH WAS SO SHOCKED AND MARTY REFUSED TO BELIEVE IT AT THAT POINT SHE DENIED SHE SAYS OH NOW NOW THAT'S NOT TRIP YOU KNOW SO SO THEN I THOUGHT WELL O KATE AND IT'S NOT SO BAD IF SHE E YOU KNOW SHE SO BELIEV SHE'S MY SISTER AND THAT'S GOOT THE NEXT WEEK THOUGH WHEN MARTY WAS VISITING THEIR MAM MISSUS MILLER SHE ASKED HER ABOUT WHAT RUDY HAD SAID MISSUS MILLER GAVE HER A NON COMMITTLE ANSWER SAYING THAT ONCE UPON A TIME THEY THOUGHT THAT MAYBE PERHAPS IT MIGHT HAVE BUT EVEN IF IT DID HAPPEN THERE WAS NO WAY TO PROVE IT SO THAT WAS THAT  WOVER THE YEARS A THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT BE SOMEONE ELSE'S CHILD FESTERED IN THE BACK OF MARTY'S MIND AND MUCH LATER WHEN SHE WAS IN HER MIDTHIRTIES SHE DECIDED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT SHE WAS WORKING FOR A GROUP OF PEDIATRICIANS WHICH INCLUDED A JANETTIC COUNSILLOR SHE TOLD THE COUNCEL HER STORY AND SAID SHE WANTED TO GET BLOOD TEST DONE THE COUNCELR ASKED HER WHAT THE MACDONALDS KNEW ABOUT ALL THIS I SAID I DON'T THINK THEY KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT SO SHE SAID WELL IF YOU WERE TO FIND OUT THAT THAT THESE PARENTS THAT YOU HAVE ARE NOT YOUR PARENTS AND THE OTHER FAMILY DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU HOW WERE YOU GIN A FEEL AND I SAID WELL I DON'T KNOW I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA AND SHE SAID YOU REALLY NEED TO CONSIDER HOW THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE YOUR FAMILY FOR YOU AND HOW IT'S GOING TO CHANGE RELATIONSHIPS FOR YOU SO SHE SAID UNLESS THERE'S A REAL I AVE REASON THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW SAT I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT YOU DIG IN TO IT THAT'S SORT OF SPOOKED MARTY SO SHE LEFT IT ALONE THAT'S WHAT MIGHT HAVE ENDED IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR MISSUS MILLER'S LETTER AT DECADE LATER IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO LEARN THAT YOUR MOTHER ISN'T YOUR MOTHER BUT IT'S EVEN HARDER WHEN THAT NEWS IS DELIVERED BY SOME ONE LIKE MISSUS MILLER TACT IS IN HER STRONG SUIT IN FACT SHE SEEMED TO HAVE IT TINEER FOR THE WHOLE THING FOR STARTERS MISSUS ILLER DIDN'T CONTACT MARTY ENSUE AT THE SAME TIME SHE FIRST SENT THE LETTER TO SUE MC DONALD THE DAUGHTER SHE BARELY KNEW AND THEN WAITED ALMOST TWO WEEKS BEFORE MAILING THE LETTER TO MARTY THE DAUGHTER SHE'D RAISED SHE SAID SHE WANTED TO CALL MARTY FIRST BUT NEVER MANAGED TO REACH HER AS RESULT MARTY GOT WORD ABOUT ONE OF THE MOST BASIC FACTS OF HER LIFE SECOND HAND ALL THE WHILE WAITING TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM HER MOTHER AND IN THE MEANTIME I HAD GOTIN PHON CALLS FROM PEOPLE I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT WERE TELLING ME YOU KNOW HEY I'M YOUR BROTHER HEY I WAS SWITCH T THAT WORTH WITH YOU YOU KNOW WHEN SHE FINALLY HEARD FOR MISSUS MILLER THE MOTHER SHE'D GROWN UP WITH NOT ONLY DID SHE GET THE LETTER BUT MISSUS MILLER HAD JUST BEEN TO THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY PARTY OF THE MAC DONALDS MARTY'S BIOLOGICAL PARENTS AND SO SHE TOOK A ONE OF THE PROGRAMMS FROM IT AND SHE MAILED IT TO ME AND BASICLY AND THIS IS GUN ASON LIKE KIND OF A SMALL THING BUT IT WAS A BIG THING TO ME SHE CIRCLED THE NAMES OF PEOPLE THAT WERE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAMME LIKE MY ONE OF MY UNCLES ON THE BIRTHSIDE EARLE GENZALLAS SHE CIRCLED HIS NAME AND SHE WROTE THIS IS YOUR UNCLE AND SHE CIRCLED MY BROTHERS IN NAME AND SO THIS IS YOUR BROTHER LIKE BOB AND CASE SHE WOULD CIRCLE THEIR NAMES AND SAY THESE RE YOUR PARENTS AND YOU KOW IAM READING THIS THING GOING WHAT DO YOU MEAN THESE ERE MY THIS IS MY UNCLE THIS IS MY BROTHER THIS IS MY MAM AND DAD THIS IS NOT MY MY FAMILY I N'T EVEN KNOW WHO THEY ARE AND I TOOK THAT AS A YOU KNOW O KA I'M SAYING AS OF RIGHT NOW YOU'RE NOT OUR KID YOU'RE THEIR KID YOU'RE IN THEIR FAMILY MARTY SAYS HER MAM MISSUS MILLER SHE'S THE WORLD IN BLACK AND WHITE SHE FOKUS ON THE FACTS O THE SITUATION MAYBE HOPING SHE COULD FIX THINGS BY SIMPLY SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT SHE WASN'T MALICIOUS SHE WASN'T TRYING TO BE HURTFUL AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS SHE WAS JUST TIRED OF SECRETS AND NOW SHE WANTED EVERY ONE'S ROLL TO BE CLEAR BUT WAS HARD MARDY SAYS TO BE ON THE RECEIVING END OF THIS SUDDEN ADAMANT TRUTH TELLY THERE WERE A FEW YEARS THERE WHERE EVERY CHANCE MY MOTHER GOT SHE MADE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT YOU KNOW I WAS A MAC DONALD FOR THE LONGEST TIME WHENEVER SHE WOULD WRITE TO ME SHE WOULD INCLUDE MC DONALD IN MY NAME MY COT ARE HE SERIOUS JUST ABSOLUTELY BAZAARE THINGS LIKE THAT SHE SHE THAT'S JUST HOW SHE IS SHE AM THERE IS NO GREAT AREA ACTUALLY MY MOTHER WANTED TO IM GOD AT COURT AND HAVE MY NAME LEGALLY CHANGED BACK TO SOON MAC DONALD AND HAVE SUE'S NAME CHANGED THAT WAS HER IDEA IT'S KIND OF YOU KNOW SHE TELLS ME THAT THIS IS YOU KNOW YOU ARE YOU'RE MY DAUGHTER AND BUT AT THE SAME TIME SHE SAYS WHEN SHE REFERS TO KAY SHE SAYS WELL YOUR MOTHER AM IS DOING SUCH AND SUCH YOUR MOTHER SAID THIS AND WHEN I THINK OF MY MOTHER I THINK OF HER DURING THIS TIME IT WAS MARDY'S DAT REVEREND MILLER WHO REASSURED HER THE STARTED TALKING ON THE PHONAL LOT HE EXPLAINED THINGS LIKE WHY ALL THOSE YEARS AGO HE REFUSED TO RETURN TO THE HOSPITAL AND SWITCH BACK THE BABIES AND HE LET MARDY KNOW THAT HE STILL LOVED HER HE DID NOT IM ONT HER TO PUSH ME OUT OF THE FAMILY HE WAS HE IN FACT WOULD CALL ME AND TELL ME YOU KNOW I DON'T CARE WHAT SHE SAYS YOU STILL OUR KID AND I'M GLAD WE HAD YOU DID YOU FEEL THAT THEN AFTER THIS HAPPENED A LITTLE BIT CLOSER YOUR DAD THAN YOUR MAM YES YET DEFINITELY AT THAT POINT MY DAD HAD THIS HERANDAS GUILT BECAUSE HE FELT LIKE IT WAS ALL HIS FAULT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BELIEVED MY MOTHER FOR YOU KNOW ALL THOSE YEARS AND HE JUST I THINK HE HONESTLY NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS A POSSIBILITAL HE THOUGHT SHE REALLY DREAMED THIS UP IN HER HEAD AND JUST GOT OBSESSED WITH IT AND THE OTHER THING WAS THAT HE REALLY THOUGT WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAY A CHILD IS A CHILD SHE'S WITH US SHE'S OURS NOW THE OTHER POLM FROM MARDY JUST HOW TO APPROACH MAC DONALDS HER BIOLOGICAL PARENTS THE WERE NICE ENOUGH WHEN SHE SPOKE TO THEM ON THE PHONE BUT THEY WEREN'T EXACTLY WELCOMING HER INTO THE FAMILY I REMEMBER TALKING TO MOTHER ABOUT YOU KNOW THIS IS YOUR BLOOD DAUGHTER HERE'S BOT MAC DONALD WHO REMEMBER WAS HAVING THESE GREAT PHOME CALLS WITH HIS NEW FOUND SISTER THIS IS THE DAUGHTER THAT ACTUALLY WAS IN YOU AND HAT YOU KNOW I MEAN I UNDERSTAND YOU DIDN'T RAISE HERE BUT SHE IS HER BLOOD YOU BIOLOGICAL DAUTER IM AND DAM I DON'T KNOW THAT IM SHE WAS AS EXCITED ABOUT IT AS I WAS AND I COULDN'T FIGURE THAT OUT AT THE TIME SHE WAS GUARDED THERE WERE ICE ENOUGH WHEN SHE SPOKE TO THEM ON THE PHONE BUT THEY WEREN'T EXCTLY WELCOMING HER INTO THE FAMILY FROM MARDY'S PERSPECTIVE H JENETTIC COUNSELLORS PREDICTION FROM YOURS BEFORE SEEMED TO BECOMING TRUE I FELT LIKE SHE WAS LOSING BOTH HER MOTHERS MARTY WROTE A LETTER TDO KA AND BOB MAC DONALD HER BIOLOGICAL PARENTS I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I WILL EXCEPT WHATEVER CONTACT YOU CHOOSE TO HAVE WITH ME EVEN IF IT'S NONE AT ALL I PROMISE YOU I'LL NEVER TRY TO MAKE YOU THINK OF ME AS YOUR DAUGHTER I KNOW THAT SUE'S YOUR DAUGHTER AND NO ONE COULD EVER EXPECT YOU TO FEEL OTHERWISE MARTY EVENTUALLY DECIDED THAT THE ONLY WAY SHE WAS GOING TO RESOLVE THIS WAS BY GETTING ON A PLAN AND FLYING OUT TO WIS CONSIN TO MEET THE MAC DONALD'S FACE TO FACE GIVE THEM A REAL CHANCE TO GET TO KNOW HER TO GET TOGETHER AT BOBIN CAME MAC DONALD'S HOUSE DIDN'T GO EXACTLY AS SHE WANTED FROM THE MAC DONALD'S PERSPECTIVE MARTY LOOKED AND ACTED REMARKABLY LIKE A MAC DONALD SHE GOT A LONG FAMOUSLY WITH THEIR SON BOB SHE HAV HAD THE EXACT SAME OIL PAINTING HANGING ON HER WALL IN CALIFORNIA AS THEY HAD IN THEIR LIVING ROOM A LANDSCAPE WITH TREES AND WATER BUT SUE WAS THE GIRL THEY HAD BROUGHT UP AND THEY FELT LOYAL TO HER PROTECTIVE I KIND OF FELT LIKE THET LIK BOBAN KA ORE KIND OF KEEPING ME IN AN ARM'S DISTANCE BECAUSE THEY WAREN'T REALLY SIR HOW THEY FELT OR WANTED TO FEEL AND I DON'T THINK SUE HAD THAT SINCE IN FACT THAT'S TRUE MAYBE BECAUSE SOME OF THE MILLER GIRLS HAD SUSPECTED THAT SHE WAS THER SISTER FOR DECADES IND BECAUSE MISSUS MILLER ALWAYS KNEW THE TRUTH SUE WAS BEING EMBRACED COMPLETELY BY THE MILLER CLAN AND SO WELL SUEAD FEARED EVERYONE WOULD CHOOSE MARTY THE OUTGOING CHURLY TO ROVER HER IT DIDN'T WORK OUT THAT WAY HERE'S MARTI IN FACT IT WAS THE EXACT OPPOSITE SHE HAD BOTH FAMILIES WANTING TO MAKE HER THAT YOU KNOW SHE WAS INCLUDED IN THEIR FAMILY THAT MILLERS WANTED TO INCORPORATE HER FAMILY INTO OUR FAMILY AS QUICKLY AS THEY COULD AND SE I I DID FEEL IN THE BEGINNING LIKE SHE WAS TAKING MY PLACE IN MY FAMILY AND THAT WAS ODD VERY ODD AND SOMETIMES I DON'T NO EXACTLY WHAT HER RELATIONSHIP IS WITH MY SISTERS YOU KNOW I I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW O HOW MUCH THEY COMMUNICA HOW MUCH THERE IN TUCH HARD OF ME REALLY DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW BECAUSE I THINK I WOULD FEEL LEFT OUT OF SOMETHING GOMING OUT WHAT IS LIKE TO BE A MAM AND TO LEARN AT THE AGE OF SIXTY NINE THAT YOUR ONLY DAUGHTER ISN'T ACTUALLY YOUR DAUGHTER AT ALL AND THAT WEREN'T BAD ENOUGH THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE IN YOUR TOWN PEOPLE AROUND YOU KNEW YEARS BEFORE YOU DID BUTS IN A MINUTE FROM SCAGOBOBEGREDIO WENT ON PROGRAM CONTINUES TIS AMERICAND LIFE MIREA GLASSED EVEYOU

PHONE CALLS WERE FEWER AND I ND OF COURSE MARTY DIDN'T REALLY CALL A WHOLE LOT SHE'S A VERY BUSY GAL AND I WAS NOT HAVING THAT MUCH COMMUNICATION WITH HER AND A I THOUGHT I WAS LOSING BOTH OF THEM CA MAC DOTTLE BEGAN GETTING NOTES AND PHONE CALLS FROM REVEREND MILLER HE TOLD HER TAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS GOD'S WILL OF THIS HAD HAPPENED EVEN SO HE ASKED HER FOR FORGIVENESS AGAIN AND AGAIN AE JUST OUTRIGHT HE JUST SAYING CAN YOU FORGIVE ME JUST JUST LIKE THAT ON THE TELEPHONE IWT YES AND QUOTING SCRIPTURS I ALL THE TIME FOR ME TO READ TO CONSOLE ME BECAUSE I HAD SAID THAT I HAD I HAD SHED A LOT OF TEARS AND AND I I HAD PROBABLY ALL OF THE EMOTIONS THAT YOU HAVE WITH THE DEATH IN A FAMILY YOU KNOW I THINK I WOULDN'T INTO A KIND OF A DEPRESSION ABOUT SIMILAR TO WHAT I DID WHEN MY MOTHER DIED AND SO CRSE WAS TRYING TO GET ME TO SAY THAT I HAD FORGIVEN THEM AND HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN HE SAID THIS WAS GOD'S WILL AND WHAT WAS YOUR ACTION I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE I DON'T I DON'T TA HAVE THAT FEELING ABOUT I DON'T THINK GOD PUNISHES US AN ANYWAY I THINK WHAT WED DO IS PRETTY MUCH OUR OWN DOING BUT HE HAD EVERYBODY CONVINCED I THINK THAT IT WAS GOD'S WILL BUT I HAD TALKED TO SEVERAL OF OUR FORMER PASTERS WHO KNEW ABOUT THE SITUATION AND THEY YA ASSURED ME THAT THIS WAS NOT GOD'S WILL THEY SAID THAT WAS A COPOUT AND SO I DON'T THINK THAT WAS TOO WELL RECEIVED WHEN I MENTIONED THAT I TOLD MISSUS MILLER I FELT THAT IT WAS GOD'S WILL WHEN SHE REALIZED THAT SHE I NOT HAVE THE RIGHT CHILD I THINK IT WAS HIS WILL THAT SHE DO SOMETHING ABOUT  SHE WROTE THAT LETTER TO MISSUS MILLER EIGHT YEARS AFTER SHE LEARND THE TRUTH THAT SO LONG IT TOOK HER TO SORT OUT HER FEELINGS CANMAC DOTLE IN THE MILLERS EVENTUALLY REACHED KIND OF DAY TON CAYIS NO LONGER ANGRY THE WAY SHE WAS BUT SHE SAID SHE'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY MISSUS MILLR STAYED SILENT FOR ALL THOSE YEARS IF I H D DOES STRONGA FEELING AS SHE DID THAT I HAD THE WRONG BABY I WOULD HAVE PURSUED IT I I DON'T CARE WHETHER MY HUSBAND OBJECTED OR NOT I I FEEL LIKE ON I SHOULD HAVE MADE IT A WRONG IN TO A RIGHT I I ONLY HAD THS ONE DAUGHTER AND SHE HAD FIVE DAUGHTERS THE FACT WE WERE EVEN ORN'D EVEN SURE WE'D HAVE ANOTHER CHILD SO I CRISI WE WERE ELATED WHEN I DID GET PRAGNANT AND AND THEN TO THINK THAT I DIDN'T GET TORASE THE ONE THAT I AD WANTED TO SO MUCH AN DO SO I NEVER WILL PROBABLY UNDERSTAND WHY I MEAN I FORGIVEN HEM BUT THAT TDOESN'T MEAN THAT I FORGOTTEN I CAN STILL WONDER WHY AND PROBABLY NEVER WILL KNOW WHY IT DIDN'T COME UP ANY SOONER T MARY MILLER WAS NINETY SIX NOW SHE LIVES BY HERSELF IN THE COUNTRY HER HOUSE IS FILLED WITH THE REMNANTS OF HER AND NORBERT'S LIFE TOGETHER IN THE CHURCH THEY WERE MARRIED FOR SIXTY YEARS THERE'S A LARGE STATUE OF AN ANGEL IN HER SITTING ROOM WHEN SE AS PLANNING TO PUT ON HER OWN GRAVE WHEN I FIRST TALKED TO ISSUS MILLER ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHEN MARTY WAS BORN SHE TOLD ME PRETTY MUCH THE SAME STORY SHE TOLD IN HER LETTER HOW SHE KNEW AS SOON AS SHE GOT HOME AND WAYED THE BABY THAT THE NURSES HAD MADE A MIS STAKE YES I TOLD INI W I THINK WE HAV THE WRONG BABY AND HE SAID WELL I WOULDN'T ISGRACE IT DOCOR BI TELLI EM E GABE WIT THE WRONG BABY  AND HE TAIS THIS IS A NICE LITTLE BABY WILL KEEPER WHEN WHEN YOUR HUSBAND SAID TO YOU NOT THIS BABY'S CUTE LET'S KEEP IT DID YOU AGRIE WITH HIM IMMEDIATELY OR WAS THE A LITTLE BIT OF ARGUING DOCTAND FORTH OFOR WHAT TO DO NOT WE DIDN'T NOT GET BAT TH BUT I KEPT LOOKIN FORHER  AND NA WAS LWAYS ATKING ANY ONE WHOM I HATHING I AND FACT I WHEN I WOULD GO DON HAVE ANY TOCH WIT NE MA DONT WE WE GOT INTRODUCED TO THEM I I KID TO TALTOHER ABOUT IT IN SHE SHE TOLD COME B THI WAS CRAZY AT WI GREGEN WOMAN THOUGHT I A HER GIRLIT WAS A LITTLE SEREAL TO HEAR HER TALK ABOUT IT IN THIS WAY LAUGHING LIKE THAT ESPECIALLY AFTER HEARING CAME AN DONALD SIDE OF THINGS BUT THEN MISSUS MILLER TOLD ME MORE OF HER SIDE OF THE STORY FOR ONE THING SHE EXPLAINED JUST HOW SIX SHE WAS AFTER THEY HAD GONE HOME WITH MARTY AN NINETEEN FIFTY WORN SHE WAS LOSING BLOOD HAVING SPASMS SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO DIE SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE EVEN STARTED CALLING ROUND TRYING TO FIND SOME ONE WHOULD BE A MOTHER TO HER SIX CHILDREN THE SICKNESS SHE SAID LASTED FOR SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS BUT THE TIME SHE WAS WELL FIXING THE BABYS WITCH PROBLEM WAS THAT MUCH HARDER EVEN IF SHE COULD SOMEHOW CONVINCED EVERY ONE IT WAS TRUE BUT WHAT HAPPENED IF HE SUDDENLY TOOK O SIX MONTH OLD AWAY FROM THE ONLY MOTHER SHE KNEW AND THE FAMILY'S RELATIONSHIP WITH DOCTOR DESLOC WAS NO SMALL THING EITHER REVEREND MILLER HAD MADE MANY VISITS TO DOCTOR DESLOCK'S WIFE WHEN SHE WAS SICK AND NOW DOCTOR DESLOCK REFUSED TO CHARGE THE MILLERS FOR ANYTHING THE MILLERS DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY AND THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AFFORD THE HEALTH CARE OTHERWISE BUT COR WE TOK CAN DED  DIN'T FER DOING IT TIS DOCTOR BEEN SO CIND TO IN GOOD DO I AND WHY RUIN ALL THAT YOU KNOW THE BE CONSIDERATION BECAUSE MISSUS MILLER DIDN'T WANT O CROSS HER HUSBAND ALL SHE COULD DO WAS HOPE THAT MABY IF SHE DROPPED ENOUGH HINTS CALLING THE GIRL'S SISTERS AND SUCH CAY WOULD EVENTUALLY REALIZED ON A ROME WHAT HAD HAPPENED IT WAS AN ODD STRATEGY IF YOU CAN EVEN CALL AT THAT WHEN SUE GOT MARRIED FOR INSTANCE THE MILLERS GAVE HER A TRIVET NORBET HAD MADE THE CARD WAS SIGNED FROM YOUR OTHER POSSIBLE PARENTS SUN DISMISSEED HIS PART OF THE WHOLE SISTER THING BUT SHE ALSO THOUGHT WAS KIND OF WEIRD MISSUS MILLER'S MOST AMBITIOUS SCHEME HAPPENED AFTER THE GIRL'S GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL WHEN THEY WERE ABOUT TO BE EIGHTEEN MISSUS MILLER ARRANGED FOR THE MC DONALDS TO COME TO DINNER SHE FIGURED IF SHE COULD SIMPLY GET CAY TA LOOK AT MARTY CAY WOULD FIGURE THINGS OUT THE EVENING JUSTSENDED UP BEING KIND OF BAFFLING FOR EVERY ONE INVOLVED SINCE ONLY MISSUS MILLER KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON BUT THEY HADN'T NOTICE ANY I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DIDT NOTICE THAT THAT MARTA LOOK LIKE THEM AND WA'S LIKE THIM I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DIDN'T OTI AT THE FACT IS MISSUS

OWN EXPERIENCSES AND SIMP DOMS THE NEW YORK TIMES NOTICE HIS TEN LETTERS FROM DOCTORS PUBLISH IS AN ARTICLE REMEMBER NO SCIENTIFIC STUDIES AT THIS POINT JUST LETTERS SOME OF THEM JOKES THE HEADLINE WAS CHINESE RESTAURANT ENDROM PUZZLES DOCTORS THE NEW SPREAD FROM THERE UNDER HEADLINES LIKE QUACK QUEEZE AND CHINESE CHOW NUMS SUM HERE'S JENIFER THE PROFESSOR RETRACED THE HISTORY I MEAN THE TITLES WERE VERY VERY OFFENSIVE AH AH EL SEE LESIF I CAN FIND THE ON FROM THE CHICAGO TRIBUE IN BROKEN ENGLISH THE HEADLINE IS CHINESE FOOD MAKE YOU CRAZY AND A SHE IS NUMBER ONE SUSPECT WOH CHINESE FOOD MAKE YOU CRAZY I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT WAS A HEADLINE YES WELS IS LIKE WHO A THEY WERE ALL REACTING TO SOMETHING THAT WASN'T EVEN REAL N IT WAS ALL PROJECTION TO THIS DAY LOTS OF CHINESE RESTAURANTS POST NO ONISCEE SIGNS AND THEIR WINDOWS AND PRINTED ON THEIR MANUS AE A A TAI M A CINY CA A IN U  CA  I I TO TIG ID A GE  CA THE CHALY I E EAY T  TN HOW IT L LOCKS OF PEOPLE THE STORY OVER THE YEARS HE TOLD GROUPS OF OTHER DOCTORS HE TOLD GENIFER WHO BELIEVED HIM SHE ALEARED THE ELEMNI MAGAZINE WHO REPORTED THOSE INTERVIEWS THEY PITCHED THE STORY TO US AND WE WERE LIKE NINTYSE SIX YEAR OLD MAN CONFESSES TO WITING A PRANK LETTER THAT DROVE THE NETIONS O DECATES LONG SCARE ABOUT A TOCSIN DOES NOT ACTUALLY TOXSIC HE'S DEAD BUT YOU HAVE REPORTINGS ORE IN BUT AS WE AND MICHAEL THE REPORTER STARTED LOKING INTO THIS MORE CAREFULLY THERE WERE FEW THINGS I ERE PUZZLING FOR ONE THE NAME OF THE RESEARCH INSTITUTE HOWARD SAID HE INVENTED THE NATIONAL BIO MEDICAL RE SEARCH FOUNDATION MICHAEL DISCOVERED IT WAS A REAL PLACE AND THE REAL DOCTOR QUACK HAD WORKED THERE KIND OF A COINCIDENCE IF HOWARD MADE UP THE NAME LIKE HE SAID HE DID IT ALSO SEEMED WEARD IF THE JOURNAL PUBLISHED A FAKE LETTER WITH DOCTOR QUACK'S NAME AND INSTITUTION ON IT AND IT WAS QUOTED IN OVER A HUNDRED NEWSPAPERS NAMING HIM AND THE LETTER IT SEEMED WEARD THAT THE REAL DOCTOR QUAK NEVER SAIT THE RECORD STRAIT NEVER POLLISHED A LETTER COMPLAINING IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE OR IN ANY OF THOSE NEWSPAPERS ALSO HOWARD DHID HE TRIED TO GET THE JOURNAL TO RETRACT IT THAT HE CALLED AN Y EDITOR WOULDN'T TAKE HIS CALLS WE REACHED OUT TO THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE DID CLIND COMMENT BUT IT SEEMES STRANGE JUST ON THE FACE OF IT HOWARD BECAME A HIGHLY A CLAIM SEARGON HE INVENTED IMPORTANT MEDICAL PROCEUTURS IT SEEMES LIKE FOR SURE HE COULDHAVE GONE THE ATTENTION OF SOME ONE AT THE JOURNAL IT'S HARD TO VERIFY WHAT REALLY HAPPENED BECAUSE EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THIS IS DED HOWARD IS DEAD THE FREND HE MADE THE BET WITH HIS DEBD THE REAL DOCTOR QUA IS DEAD BUT DOCTOR QUACK HIS KITS WE CALLED THEM A DOCTOR'S FAMILY WE ALSO SPOKE TO ONE OF HIS COLLEAGUES OF THE RESEARCH FOUNDATION AND THE SON OF HIS BAUS THERE THEY ALL SAID YES DOCTOR ROBERT HOLMEMAN QUACK DID WRITE THE LETTER HIS DOUGHTER SAID E WAS PROUD OF IT THAT HE WAS A CONCERNED DOCTOR IN A CURIOUS SCIENTIST WOULD OFTEN POSE QUESTIONS LIKE THIS WASN'T JOKE AT ALL THE THOUGHT THAT HOWARD WAS GOING AROUND TELLING THIS STORY FOR YEARS HE CREEPT ROUT A LITTLE AND WHEN YOU READ THE ORIGINAL LETTER THERE ARE DETAILS THAT SEEMD MORE LIKELY TO COME FROM HER FATHER THAN FROM HOWARD LIKE WHEN HE SAYS HE MOVED TO THE UESS WHICH THE REAL DOCTOR QUACK DID AND HOW WE'S VERY SPECIFIC THAT THE CYNDROM HAPPENS WITH NORTHERN CHINESE FOOD IN THE SIXTIES HOW MANY WHIKE EYES AND PHILADELPHIA WOULD HAVE MADE THAT DISTINCTION ALSO HOLMON QUACK IS AN ACTUAL CANTONESE NAME WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT HOWARDS STEEL THREW TOGETHER RANDOM CHINESE SOUNDING SYLLABLES TO ARRIVE AT THAT I CALLED UP GENIFER THE PROFESSOR THAT HOWARD STEEL HAD LEFT THE VOICE MAIL FOR AM I FINALLY REACHED THE QUACK FAMILY O E AND THEY TOLD ME SOMETHING AM THEY SAY THAT THEIR FATHER DID WRITE THE LETTER WHAT TADD THEY SAY THAT HE WROTE IT AND THE'RE CERTAIN WELL O HE WHAT O YOU THINK OF THAT I OUT I WE HAVE NO IDEA I JUST LIKE CANNOT BELIEVE THAT DOCTOR STEEL MADE THIS UP WRIT NOW IM LIKE I THER WHO WERE THEYR TWO LETTER I D TH BAT A HAV  ID LIK THEY HAPPEN TO WRIT O THOT IM AT HE HAN TIME I LIKE WON GDOT E DID IT WLIKE ONE E  THAT WOU ED IT LIKE  ONWY WE KNOW I MEAN I CAN RELY WI  I MEAN HAV ME   I MEAN   I WE  I WE ARE HE O LET I MY HOM ANY REDIN OYLY A THERE WERE TWO OPTIONS NEITHER OF THEM GOOD I SOME ONE HAS BEEN TELLING A STORY THAT'S NOT TRUE FOR FIFTY YEARS ONE OF THESE TWO MEN BOTH OF WHOM WERE BY ALL ACCOUNTS RILLIANT UPSTANDING PILLARS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES EITHER HOWARD WAS FESSING UP TO SOMETHING HE TOTALLY DID NOT DO CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WHOLE MS G MS WHEN ACTUALLY HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT OR HOWARD WAS TELLING THE TRUTH AND DOCTOR ROBERT HOLMEAN QUACK WE LOVED PETYATRICIAN AND RESEARCER HAT SEEMED THIS LETTER TO THE EDITOR IN THE JOURNAL WITH HIS NAME ON IT THAT HE DIDN'T WRITE WAS DELIGHTED WITH HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND ROLLED WITH IT FOR FIFTY YEARS I HAD ONE PERSOE OUGH TO CALL HOWARD STEALS STAUGHTER ANNA SHE GREW UP HEARING THE STORY I TOLD DER EVERYTHING I JUST TOLD YOU CAY AT THAT IS THE SHOK BUT ACTUALLY NOT THAT BIGES SHOCK AN TOOK HER ABOUT TWO SECONDS TO MAKE SENSE OF ALL THIS SHE BELIEVE THE QUOKS NOT HER FATHER NO I I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WHOU NEW HAM AND LAV AN WOULD WOULD BE WOULD BE SURPRISED IT YIT ON ONE MORE THING IN THE LIFE OF MY GAD THIS SHE SAID THIS IS EXACTLYVE THE KIND OF THING HE LOVE TO DOU HE LIKED TO PRANK PEOPLE AND HE TOLD LOTS OF BIG STORIES ABOUT HIMSELF MANY TRUE AND SOME NOT YE COULD NEVER TOLDALLY BELIEVE HIM AND NEVER QUITE NOT BELIEVE HIM IN FACT SHE SAIYS IT HELP EXPLAIN THIS OTHER THING THAT EVEN THOUGH HER FATHER SUPPOSEDLY ON THE BET HIS BODY NEVER PAID HIM THE FACT THAT THAT WOULD NEVER THATLE THAT I IT IT THAT THAT THAT THAT MAYBE IT WITH A WINK WINK BETWEEN THEM BOTH WELL SO NOW KNOWING ALL THIS DO YOU FEEL CONVINCED THAT HE DIDN'T WRITE THE LETTER IT THEN THE POINT IN THAT DIRECTION DOESN'T IT I MEAN IF I THOUGHT WE WERE DEALING WITH YOU KNOW TOO TRAIT WAY DRAT ARO NO NON TAND PEVISIONS I MIGHT BE ARGUING A STRONGER PEVITION BUT NOWING ME TO CLOWN THA I'M I'M NOT SURE I CAN NON THERE'S NOT MUCH I CAN FY SO IT SEEMS LIKE HOWARD DIDN'T WRITE THE FAKE PRANK LETTER THAT CAUSE DECATES OF CHAOS HIS PRANK WAS THAT HE SAID HE HAD WRITTEN THE LETTER HE WAS CLAIMING CREDIT FOR CHAOS HE DIDN'T CREATE IT WAS COMPLICATED O EVEN THINK ABOUT O MY GAD H A EH A YOU FINNY I WELL HERE WE ARE  A FIRST THE WORLD BELIEVED I MUST SHE WAS BAD FOR YOU AND IT WASN'T AND NOW WE NEARLY BELIEVED THE SECOND PIECE OF FAKE NEWS THAT AD ALL STARTED WITH HOWARD HERE WAS WHERE ANNA CAME DOWN LOVING HER FATHER AND HIS BEST FRIEND BUT ALSO WHAT THE HELL I WISH I COULD GIVE THEM BOTH A PIECE OF MY MIND I'M NOT ANGRY BUT I COULD WANT A AY YOU OW EVERYBODY HUGE APOLOGY WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU AND HOU WOULD JUST ART LAUGHING I'M SURRE AND YE WOULD HAVE BIG MISCHIEVEV GRAND AND HE'D FAKE THEM THING LIKE I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY IN APOLOGY YOU ALL SHOULD HAVE HAD YOUR HEAD TREWED ON RAIT FIGURE OUT I OIS A YOK SO MANY PEOPLE NEAR THE END OF THEIR LIVES ARE TRYING TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE TROUBLE LIKE A LASTS LIKE A LAST ACTS LIKE A LIFELONG LEGACY PRANK IND OF THAT THE LAH LAGH I DN WA TO I I TOT ANY BI TE WON BEWE ME AY WIT I BEER AN HAPPY TI TO THING A FURTHER BOT YOU BELIEVE I DID TOR FIF TE OBE I DON' NNY ONE RE WAR TO WIT E CHIP SHUT MY MOW BUT E TRI WIHT  I E SHU PRETTY SO E NOT E HOWARD DIED JUST A FEW MONTHS AFTER HE LAUGHT HIS WAY THROUGH THOSE INTERVIEWS HE WAS NINETY SEVEN LILY SULLIVAN IS ONE T PTISUS SORE SHO THAT TO B ABY'S GOT BANK OGEY I KNO OHUNLIKELY THIS SOUNDS BUT WE NOW HAVE ANOTHER OLD GUY BASICLLY CRANKING THE WORLD RIGHT BEFORE HE DIES BET ESCAL THAT GETS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE INVOLVED AN EXCITED IN TALKING ABOUT THIS GUISE PLAN THAT HE SET EMOTION FOR YEARS AND YEARS STEPHANY FHO EXPLAINS AN NINETEEN TWENTY SIX IN TORONO CANADA IS SEVENTY TWO YEAR OLD LAWYER NAMED CHARLES VANCE MILLER WAS AT LUNCH AT THE QUEEN'S HOTEL WITH TWO LAWYER FRIENDS THE GONE TO AN ARGUMENT OVER SOME LEGAL MATTER MILLER TOLD THEM THEY WERE BOTH WRONG AND HE PROVE IT IF THEY FOLLOWED HIM UP TO HIS OFFISS HE EAGERLY RAN UP THREE FLIGHTS OF STAIRS GRABBED A LAWBOOK PLOPPED IT ON HIS DESK AND THEN DIED JUST WHAT HIS HAD DOWN ON THE DESK AND WAS GONE A COUPLE DAYS LATER RUMORS STARTED SWIRLING CHARLES VANCE MILLER HAD DONE WELL FOR HIMSELF GONE RICH HE'D AVOIDED SCANDAL HIS WHOLE LIFE WAS AN UPSTANDING CITIZEN THOUGH H HAD NO FAMILY NEVER MARRIED HE'D HINTED THAT HE'D LEAVE HIS FORTUNE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONO BUT WHEN HIS FELLOW LAWYERS BROUGHT OUT HIS WILL THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY FOUND AS SOON AS MILLER'S PEOPLE STARTED EXECUTING HIS WILL THEY REALIZED THAT HIS WILL WAS LIKE AN ELABORATE PRANK AS IF HE'D THROWN A BUNCH OF MONEY OUT OF A WINDOW TO WATCH WHAT WOULD HAPPEN HE LEFT STOCK IN A BREWERY TO PROHIBITIONIST O PASTORS HE GAVE HIS RASING STOCK TO PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T BELIEVE IN BEDDING HE SAID HE WANTED TO LEAVE HIS VACATION HOME IN JAMAICA TO THREE OTHER LAWYERS AN ICE THINK FOR THEM TO SHARE EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT THE THREE LAWYERS ALL HEATED EACH OTHER BUT BY FAR THE CLAWS THAT UNLACH THE MOST MAHAM WAS THE LAST ONE IT'S ABOUT ALL THE REST OF HIS MONEY I'LL JUST REAT IT TO YOU AT THE EXPIRATION OF TEN YEARS FOR MY DEATH GIVE IT AND IT'S ACCUMULATIONS TO THE MOTHER WHO HAS SINCE MY DEATH GIVEN BIRTH AND TORONO TO THE GREATEST NUMBER OF CHILDREN AS SHOWN BY THE REGISTRATIONS UNDER THE VITAL STATISTIC'S ACT AND E IN OTHER WORDS THE WOMAN WHO HAD THE MOST BABIES IN THE TEN YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH WOULD BE AWARDED A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY NINE MILLION CANADIAN DOLLARS INTO DAY'S MONEY ERE ALMOST SEVEN MILLION YOU WEST DOLLARS THERE WERE IMMEDIATELY A NUMBER OF THEORIES AS TO WHY MILLER DID THISS BUT NONE OF THEM WORE CHARITABLE IF HE REALLY WANTED TO SUPPORT A YOUNG WOMAN WITH A BUNDLE OF KIDS HE COULD HAVE JUST WILLED ALL THE MONEY TO HER AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH BUT SETTING THIS UP OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS CREATED A TWISTED CONTEST SOME SAID HE WAS AN AVID SUPPORTER OF BIRTH CONTROL SO MAYBE SETTING OFF A BABY MAKING STORM COULD BE A WIC KED WAY TO FORCE A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT SOME SAID HE WAS TRYING TO TEST THE LEGAL SYSTEMS ABILITY TO HOLD UP A CRAZY WILL BUT THAT HE'D REALLY EXPECTED IT WOULD BE THROWN OUT THAT THE MONEY WOULD AUTOMATICALLY JUST BE DONATED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONO HIS ALL MAMATER HEOPLE SAID THAT MILLER HAD BEN OBSESSED WITH THE IDEA OF WHAT PEOPLE WOULD DO FOR MONEY HE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT HOW EVERYBODY HAD THEIR PRICE MAYBE HE WAS TESTING THE WOMEN OF TORONO TO SE WHAT THEIRS WAS I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HE KNOW FULLY KNOWS WHY HE DID THUSS THIS IS ELIZABETH WILTON SHE WROTE A TWO HUNDRED PAGE DISERTATION ON THE CONTEST I JUST SHINK HE SAW IT AS A BIG JOKE I FEEL LIKE THE MODERN DAY WORD FOR AT WOULD BE THAT HE WAS BASICALLY A TROLL THAT WOULD BE A GOOD WORD FOR IT YEH HE PRETT MUCH COPS TO IT IN HIS WILL HE SAYS THIS WILL IS NECESSARILY UNCOMMON AND CAPRICIOUS BECAUSE I HAVE NO DEPENDENTS OR NEAR RELATIONS AND NO DUTY RESTS UPON ME TO LEAVE ANY PROPERTY AT MY DEATH AND WHAT I DO LEAVE IS PROOF OF MY FOLLY IN GATHERING AND RETAINING MORE THAN I REQUIRED AN MY LIFETIME APPARENTLY MILLER REALLY LIKE TO DROP DOLLAR BILLS ON THE SIDE WALK AND HIDE AND WATCH PEOPLE PICK THEM UP WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE KAN OF PERSON WHO PLANT A WALLET IN THE STREET APUT IT ON YOU TUBE TO DAY AS A COMMENTARY ON HUMAN NATURE YE I FEEL LIKE I KNOW WHO THAT GAY IS  A BFAFOR THE FIRST FEW YEARS AFTER MILLER DIED NOTHING HAPPINED A FEW NEWS PAPER ARTICLES WERE WRITTEN NOBODY TOOK A VERY SERIOUSLY SOME RELATIVES WENT TO COURT ARGUING THAT THE MONEY SHOULD GO TO THEM AND THEN SIX YEARS AFTER HIS DETH THE A TRERNY GENERAL INTRODUCED A BILL TRYING TO NULLIFY THE WILL AND HAVE THE MONEY DONEATED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONO THIS WAS A MISTAKE TOTALLY BACK FIRED BHEFORE THIS NOT MANY PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT THE WILL BUT NOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS TRYING INVALIDATIT THE PRESS PICKED IT UP AND THERE WAS A HUGE PUBLIC OUTCRY BUT NOT IN THE WAY YOU MIGHT THINK THE PUBLIC WAS LIKE BABY MAKING RACE HELL YAH WE WANT A BABY MAKING RACE  C WOMENS GREP SUPPORTED THE CONTEST BECAUSE THEY FELT WOMEN SHOULD HAVE A FAIR SHOT AT THE MONEY WHICH WHAT CAN I SAY WAS A DIFFERENTIME OTHERS DISAGREED WITH THE GOVERNMEN INTERVENING IN PEOPLE'S WILLS AND AFFAIRS ALTOGETHER IT CAUSED AN UPROAR THE GOVERNMENT BACK TRACKED SAID O GE FUN YOU PEOPLE HAVE FUN AD WITH THAT THE RACE WAS ON USUALLY WHEN THE STORY HAS BEEN TOLD IT'S LIKE HA HA A MAN CREATED THE ZANY WILL THAT SET OFF A WILD BABY MAKING STORM IN CANADA THE CONJURS BREEDY BUNCH IMAGES OF BIG FAMILIES HAPPILY STUPPING THEIR WAY TO FAME AND FORTUN NEE DEEP IN CABAGE PATCH CHILDREN BUT THE WAIT UNFOLDED WAS ACTUALLY MUCH DARKER BE CAUSE OF COURSE THE STORY IS ABOUT AN OLD MAN ENCOURAGING WOMEN TO GO THROUGH THE EXCRUCIATING PAIN IN DANGER OF CHALDBIRTH AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE AND A TEN YEAR PERIOD E TEN YEAR PERIOD THAT WAS ALREADY HALF OVER THIS CONTEST DIDN'T REALLY GET STARTED UNTIL SIX YEARS IN THAT MADE ITS CEWED FROM THE STARK IT MEANT SUDDENLY THE ONLY CONTENDERS WERE WOMEN WHO HAD ABOUT SIX BABIES IN THE LAST SIX YEARS WOMEN WHO DIDN' EVEN KNOW THERE WAS HEN CONTEST TO BE PART OF THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT IT QUICK WHEN REPORTERS STARTED POUNDING ON THEIR DOORS IT WAS MADNESS REALLY IT WAS IMMEDIA FEEDING FRENZY THIS IS CARAN NOLON SHE WORKED WITH ELIZABETH TO DEVELOP A SCREEN PLAY FOR A MOVY BASE ON THE CONTEST THAT AIRED ON CANADIAN TELL A VISION IN TWO THOUSAND TO AS SOON AS THE WILL WAS VERIFIED REPORTERS WENT THROUGH THE BIRTH REGISTRY FOUND WOMEN WHO HAD ALREADY GIVEN BIRTH TO ABOUT SIX CHILDREN SINCE CHARLES'S DEATH AND DASHED TO THEIR HOMES TO TRY AND GET THE EXCLUSIVE OU NONT THEY QOINT THE PHRASE THE STORK DERBY UH COMPARING IT TOO LIKE A HORSE RACE SO THERE WAS  A MD DASH TO TRACK DOWN THE WOMEN GET THEIR EXCLUSIVE STORIES AND TO FOLLOW THEM IN HOUND THEM UOH ON THE VERY INTIMAT AND PERSONAL DETAILS OF THEIR LIFE IT MUST HAVE BEEN A JARRING EXPERIENCE TO BE AN AUTOMATIC FRONT RUNNER AND THIS BIZAR CONTEST BUT MOST OF THE MOTHERS WENT ALONG WITH IT BECAUSE OF THE NINE MILLION DOLLARS MANY OF THE CONTESTANTS WERE DESPERATELY POOR DURING THOSE FIRST SIX YEARS THE GREAT DEPRESSION AT TAKEN HOLD NEARLY A QUARTER OF TORONO'S FAMILIES WERE UN WELL FARE FAMILIES WERE LIVING IN SHACKS OR CAMPS SOME EVEN A GROUNDHACKS TO KEEP FROM STARVING CANTAD AS BIRTH RATE HAD ACTUALLY PLUMETED AT THE TIME AND SO MOST OF THE FAMILIES THAT SUDDENLY FOUND THEMSELVES ON THE RUNNING TO RECEIVE THE STORK DURBY MONEY AGREED TO MEDIA SCRUTINY BECAUSE THEY WANTED THE CHANCE AT THE PRIZE AND BECAUSE AND THE SHORT TERM THE NEWSPAPERS OFFERED THE MONEY EXCLUSIVE CONTRACTS WERE REPORTERS COULD COME AND PHOTOGRAPH AND INTERVIEW THE FAMILIES WHENEVER THEY WANTED TO SOMETIMES THE FAMILIES EVENG GOT ADVERTISING DEALS FOR THINGS LIKE SO IN MANY WAYS THIS WAS SORT OF LIKE AN OG REALITY SHOW ALL BE IT A REALLY PERVERSE ONE THE FRONT RUNNERS OF THE STORK DIRBY EVEN BECAME HOUSEHOLD NAMES LIKE JOHN AN CEAPLESS AITE WERE MAYBE MORE LIKE OCTAMOM AFTER ALL IT WAS BUILD ON THE NEWS REALS AS FREEK CANADIAN RACE TPAPERS ALL OVER THE WORLD FROM THE NEWW YORK DAILY NEWS TO THE MARSHFIELD WISCONSIN NEWS HERALD PICKED UP THE STORY THE PRESSFOLLOWED A BUNCH OF CONTENDERS BUT I'M ONLY GIN A RUN THROUGH THREE OF THE LONG TERM FAVORITES TO WIN ONE OF THE FIRST COMPETITORS THAT THE NEWSPAPERS DUG UP WAS MISSUS GRACE BIGNATO AT I WANT TO GIVE AWAY WHO ONE OR HOW MANY KIDS MISSUS BICNATO ACTUALLY HAD DURING THE RACE BUT OVER HER LIFETIME MISSUS BIGNATTO WAS BRIGNANT TWENTY FOUR TIMES THOUGH ONLY TWELVE OF THOSE CHILDREN LIVED SHE WAS A WORKING MOTHER SHE WAS A WAS WITH LANGUAGES PICKED UP POLISH GERMAN YITTISH AND WORKED AS A CORT ENTERPRETER AN ITALIAN ALL THE WHILE SHE RAISED HER TWELVE CHILDREN AND WOULD GET UP AT FOUR THIRTY IN THE MORNING TO MAKE STWO DOZEN BUTTER PARTS MACARONY MEAT BALLS SAUSAGE AND HER FAMOUS RED SAUCE FOR HER FAMILY BUT THE PUBLIC DIDN'T EXACTLY SEE HER AS A HERO HERE'S CAREN AGAIN THE CULTURALL MAKE UP OF TRONA WITH THE TIME A WAS A VERY WASBE WASBE SOCIETY AND WE HAVE THIS ITALIAN FAMILY HERE WHO IS YOU KNOW REPRODUCING CHILDREN AT RATE AT OUT PASE THE THE WHITE PROTESANT  ANGLO SAXANTS MISSUS BIGNATTA'S HUSBAND WAS AN ITALIAN IMMIGRAN AND SOME PAPERS WEREN'T KIND ABOUT THAT THESE WERE THE YEARS LEADING UP TO WORLD WERE TOO OF COURSE IT DIDN'T HELP THAT ONE OF THE OTHER ITALIAN CONTESTANTS NAMED ONE OF THEIR DERBY BABIES LITTLE BENIDO MUSELINI BUT BECAUSE OF THEIR NATIONALITY ITALIAN FAMILIES IN THE RACE RECEIVED FONE CALLS CALLING THEIR FAMILIS TASHESTS AND THREATENING TO KIDNAP THEIR CHILDREN   CONTESTANT NUMBER TOO WAS MISSUS X SHE WAS THE SCANDALOUS ONE SHE WAS A SOCIAL OUTCAST BECAUSE FOR CHILDREN WERE FATHERD BY DIFFERENT MAN WHICH WAS YOU KNOW TO BO AND SHE WAS SHAME FOR THAT SHE WAS CONSIDERED TO BE A TROLOP A YOU KDOTBY HAVING ACHILDREN WITH MORE THAN ONE MAN IT'S A SAUCY WORD START USING THAT MISSUS EX HAD FIVE CHILDREN FROM HER HUSBAND BUT THEN HER MARRIAGE FELLPARK HE MOVED OUT AND SHE ENTERED INTO A NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH A MAN AND HAD ANOTHER FIVE KITS WITH HIM SHE WANTED TO MARRY HIM BUT DIDN'T OF ENOUGH MONEY TO GO THROUGH WITH THEIR DIVORCE ALL IN ALL MISSUS EX HAD TEN CHILDREN BY THE TIME SHE WAS TWENTY FOR SHE TRIED TO HIDE HER IDENTITY BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER SITUATION BUT HER NAME WAS EVENTUALLY RE VEALED PAULINE MAY CLARK CONTESTANT NUMBER THREE WAS MISSUS KENNEY SHE'S MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IN THE WHOLE WHOLSTOWER WHY SHE ER FAVORITE I THINK HER ECCENTRICITY FOR ONE THING A HER PASSION AND HER UNDENIABLE BELIEF THAT SHE WAS THE CHOSEN ONE IF YOU WILL MISSUS KENNEY WAS IN IT TO WIN IT SHE WAS UNDER FIVE FEET TALL BUT OVER THE COURSE OF HER LIFETIME SHE WOUND UP CARRYING NINETEEN PREGNANCIES TO TERM SHE WAS FRENCH KANADIAN MARRIED TO AN IRISH MAN AND SHE BELIEVED THAT MONEY WAS HERS SHE SAID SHE HAD THE GIFT OF SECOND SIGHT AND A DIVINE CONNECTION WITH MILLER WHO TOLD HER SHE WAS GOING TO WIN SOOF COURSE IT HAD TO BE TRUE MISSUS KNNEY WAS A TALENT AT WOODCARVER AND OFTEN TOLD HER CARVINGS IN THE STREET AND SHE CARVED A LARGE NUMBER OF STATUES OF MILLER EVEN NAMED ONE OF HER CHILDREN AFTER HIM AT ONE POINT A BUNCH OF THE LEADING DERBY MOTHERS GOT TOGETHER AND SAID SCREW THIS WHOLE RACE LES TU SHARE THE WINNEINGS EREWAS TON OF MONEY THEY WE ALL POOR IT WULD STILL RESULT IN PLENTY FOR EVERY ONE BUT MISSUS KENNEY WAS THE SOUL HOLD OUT THE ONLY ONE WHO INSISTED NO I'M THE WINNER SHE SHOUTED ONCE AND I WON'T SPLIT WITH ANY MONEY WHY SHOULD I IT'S MY MONEY AND IF THE JUDGE DOESN'T GIVE IT ALL TO ME I'LL WALK RIGHT UP TO THE BENCH AND PUNCHIM IN THE EYE SO E OUT MISSUS KENNEY WAS TOUGH AS NAILS BUT SHE PROBABLY WAS THE POOREST OF THE THREE HER FAMILY LIVED IN A SLUM AND THEIR HOME WAS INFESTED WITH RATS ONE NIGHT RATS ATTACKED THREE OF HER CHILDREN TINY THREE MONTH OLD PATR A THE WORCED OF IT HERE'S CAREN SO YES IT HAD BIDDEN THE BABY ON THE UM IN THE FACE AND NECK AREA AND YOU NOW AS WE ALL KNOW THROUGHOUT HISTORY RATS KARRIED DISEASES AM BUT THEY COULDN'T AFFORD THE HOSPITAL IT COULDN'T TEIT IS THIS IS SO DIFFICULT TO EVEN TIE YET'S UNBELIEVABLE THAT ITS STILL CHOKES ME UP MISSUS KENNY AND HER NEIGHBORS TRIED DESPERATELY TO HAVE THE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE VISIT HER HOME BUT TO KNO AVAIL THE BABY DIED AND THEN IT WAS ALL OVER THE FRONT PAGES OF THE NEWSPAPER BUT ALWAYS WRITTEN IN TERMS OF WHAT THIS MAN FOR THE CHANCES OF MISSUS KENNY OR WHATEVER OTHER WOMAN WAS YOU KNOW THAT THE COVERAGE WAS CENTRED ON EVERY LOS OR TRAGEDY OR TRIUMPH WAS ALWAYS PUT IN TERMS OF THER CHANCES IN THE IN THE RACE WYOU KNOW AM NOT IN TERMS OF WHAT KIND OF A SYSTEM DO WE HAVE WERE SOME ONE'S BABY CAN DIE OF RAT BITES IN THE FIRST PLACE IT'S HARD TO SAY HOW MANY WOMAN HAD BABY SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS RACE WHEN THEY DOCT O REPORTERS EVERY ONE ALWAYS AD THE SAME THING I WOULD HAVE HAD THIS CHILD ANY WAY ATTEND TO BELIEVE MISSUS BIGNATTO AND MANY OF THE OTHER CATHOLIC FAMILIES ON THE RACE IT DON'T THINK MISSUS BIGNATTA WAS EVER PLAYING THE GAME SHE'D BEEN CRANKING OUT A BABY A YEAR LONG BEFORE SHE HEARD A WORD ABOUT THE DERBY SO THE WHOLE CONTEST WAS JUST NATTED BONISS TO HER BUT THEN THERE WAS MISSUS KENNY WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY PLAYING TO WIN AND SET OUTRIGHT THAT SHE WAS TRYING TO MAKE BABIES AND THEN YOU HAVE MISSUS CLARK MISSUS CLARK'S SITUATION WAS THE MOST UNSETTLING IT CAME OUT THAT MISSUS CLARK'S LOVER HAD DRAWN UP A CONTRACT WITH HER WHERE HE COULD GET HALF HER WINNINGS IF HE IMPREGNATED HER ENOUGH MISSUS CLARK'S LOVER WAS ALSO ABUSIVE HE GIVEN HER A BLACK IE BROKE HER DOOR DOWN CHASED HER OUT INTO THE STREET AFTER A FIGHT SO MAYBE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE PREGNANT AS MANY TIMES AS SHE WAS MAYBY SHE WAS FORCED TO HERE'S ELIZABETH BE SET A WONDER WAS SHE BASICALLY ABUSED WAS SHE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT ALSO THE KIND OF POWER DYNAMAC THAT MILLER SET UP BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN AND AT THAT I'M LIKE IF YOUR PARTNER OR IF YOUR HUSBAND OR YOUR LOVER THOT THAT IF HE GOT YOU PREGNANT OVER AND OVER THAT YOU MIGHT WIN MILLIONS O DOLLARS AND SHE WAS A VERY YOUNG WOMAN AND M SO YOU WERE SORT OF INSINUATING THAT MAYBE THESE THESE WOMEN MIGHT HAVE BEEN COERSED OR YOU KNOW I MEAN I DON'T KNOW I MEAN I THINK IT DOESN'T TAKE A LOT FOR SOME ONE TO PUT TOGETHER WITH THIS YOUNG WOMAN AND SO MANY BABIES AND WITH THIS HUGE PRIZE IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE IT LOOKED LIKE MISSUS BIGNATTA WAS GON AWAN THEN IN NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR HAD LINE'S READ THAT MISSUS KENNY HAD TAKEN THE LEA IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE ANOTHER WOMAN MISSUS TIMLAK SPED TO THE FRENT IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX MADAM X WAS LISTED AS A LATE ENTRY DIED FOR SECOND ALL THE WHILE THE PHYSICAL TOOL FOR THESE MOTHERS WAS ANORMIS MISSUS BIGNATTO SUFFERED A HEMORAGE NEAR THE END OF HER FINAL PREGNANCY WHAND MANY OF THE STORETURBY MOTHERS WERE IN ANOTHER HOSPITAL FOR OPERATIONS AND TRANSFUSIONS AND ALL THREE MOTHERS SUFFERED THE EMOTIONAL TOL OF HAVING STILL BORN BABIES DURING THE RACE MOST OF THE WOMEN COULDN'T AFFORD TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN IN HOSPITALS AND SO THE INFANT MORTALITY RATE OF THE DERBY BABIES WAS SIX TIMES THAT OF THE NATIONAL AVERAGE THIRTY FOUR PER CENT OF THESE BABIES DIED BUT ASIDE FROM AN ARTIC LER TO AGAIN THE PRASS ONLY SAW THESE DEBTHS IN THE CONTECTS OF THE RACE THE HEADLINE IN A NINETEEN THIRTY SIX MONTRIAL PAPER WAS STILL BORN INFANT MAY ASSURE PRIZE UNDERNEATH A STILLBORN CHILD MAY ASSURE MISSUS MATTHEW KENNEY THE PRIZE AND THE STORK DERBY UNDER THE WILL OF LATE CHARLES VANCS MILLER HER NEARS COMPETITOR IS BELIEVED TO BE MISSUS JOSEPH BIGNATA THE RACE ENDED ON HOLLOWEN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX BUT AT FIRST IT WASN'T CLEAR WHOD ON HERE'S HOW OUR THREE COMPETITORS STOOD ON THAT DATE MISSUS KENNY CLAIMED TO HAVE HAD ELEVEN CHILDREN MISS CLARK SAID SHE HAD ELEVEN AS WELL MISSUS BIGNATTO AT NINE BUT MISSUS KENNY AND MISSUS CLARK DIDN'T WALK AWAY WITH THE PRIZE THAT EASILY WITH MISSUS CLARK THE SCANDALOUS ONE WHO HAD DIED FOR THE LARGEST NUMBER OF CHILDREN THE LAWYERS AND CHARGE OF THE ESTATE HAD SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HER CASE AND RAISED THE QUESTION OF WHETHER IT CHILDREN BORN AT A WEDLOCK SHOULD COUNT THIS IS WHERE IT WAS CLEAR THAT THERE HAD BEEN A HUGE OVERSIGHT NOBODY HAD ACTUALLY SET RULES FOR THIS CONTEST AT ITS BEGINNING REMEMBER MILLER EXPLAINED THIS WHOLE CONTEST IN TWO SENTENCES IN IS WELL SO AS THE COURT SAW IT THERE WERE NEW ONCES THAT NEEDED TO BE FIGURED OUT RULES TO BE SET BUT OF COURSE ONLY AFTER THE FACT OF EVERYTHING AFTER THE BABIES HAD BEEN BORN AND THE BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS ADMINISTERED A MASSIVE MULTI WAY COURT BATTLE BROKE OUT ALL OF THE CONTESTANTS HAD TO GO TO COURT TO PROVE THAT THEY HAD THE MOST CHILDREN EACH WOMAN HAD TO LAWYER UP AND GO UP AGAINST THE LAWYERS FOR THE EXECUTORS OF THE ESTATE THE FIGHT WENT ON FOR TWO YEARS AND OF COURSE NOW THE RULES WOULD BE DETERMINED IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE TO FIGURE OUT OF HER ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN WOULD COUNT MISSUS CLARK AND HER LOVERS ABUSIVE SEXUAL HISTORY WAS SCRUTINIZED ON THE STAND HE RECOUNTED HIS PHYSICAL VIOLENCE WITH HER ADMITTED TO GIVING HER A BLACK EYE AND BUSTING DOWN THE DOOR TO HER HOUSE AND TO THE CONTRACT HE DREW UP WHEN HE MENTIONED THE CONTRACT THE COURTROOM BURST OUT INTO ROCKES MOCKING LAUGHTER AND IN FACT THE LAWYERS REGULARLY THREW IN CRUDE JOKES DURING THE TRIAL SOLICITING GIGGLES FROM THE AUDIENCE AND THE END IT WAS DECIDED THAT ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN COULD NOT BE COUNTED WITHIN THE DERBY AND SO MISSUS CLARK'S NUMBER GOT NOT DOWN TO FIVE SHE WAS OUT OF THE RUNNING THEN CAME MISSUS KENNEY THE ONE WHO BELIEVED SHE WAS THE WINNER AND HAD CARVED STATUES OF MILLER SHE'D ALSO TIED FOR ELEVEN BUT APPARENTLY TWO OF HER CHILDREN HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY REGISTERED PROBABLY BECAUSE MISSUS KENNEY WAS TWO POOR TO DELIVER CHILDREN N HOSPITALS SHE'D HAD THEM AT HOME INSTET THAT BROUGHT HER COUNT DOWN TO NINE CHILDREN BUT NO BIG DEAL SHE WAS STILL IN THE RUNNING THEN THE LAWYERS POINTED OUT THREE OF HER CHILDREN HAD BEEN STILL BORN QUICKWARNING I'M ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT A LOT OF TRAMATIC BIRTHS UNTIL THIS POINT EVERYONE HAD ASSUMED THAT STILLBOARD CHILDREN WOULD COUNT FOR THE DERBY AGAIN THIS HADN'T BEN IN THE RULES AND AFTER ALL THESE WOMEN HAD CARRIED THESE CHILDREN TO TERM BUT NOW AT MISSUS KENNEY'S TRIAL LAWYERS FOR THE EXECUTORS OF THE ESTATE STARTED QUESTIONING THAT AND SO MISSUS KENNEY HAD TO SIT ILE A PACK OF LAWYERS ARGUED AROUND HER ABOUT HOW LEGITIMATE HER DEAD CHILDREN WERE THEY BROUGHT UP DOCTORS AND HAD THEM GIVE GRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS OF THE STILLBERS IF EACH BABY BREATHED IF ITS HARTEVER BEAT SHE HAD TO RELIVE THE MOMENTS ALL OVER AGAIN MISSUS KENNY CRIED THROUGHOUT THIS AND EVENTUALLY RAN FROM THE COURTROOM IT WAS JUST ALL TOO MUCH FOR HER AND AT ONE POINT SHE LEFT THE COURT ROOM JUST SCREAMING THAT SHE WAS BEING TREATED LIKE A DOG AND YOU KNOW THERE NEVER WAS A SENSITIVE PORTRAIT OF THIS WOMAN IT WAS ALL SORT OF CARICATURES TALSO I THINK THE COVERADGE JUST CONTINUED IN THAT WAY YOU KNOW THE NEWS PAPER REPORT SAID SHE WAS SHRIEKING INSINUATED THAT SHE WAS DRUNK AND SAID QUOTE DURING THE SCUFFLE MISSUS KENNY DEALT AT LEAST HALF A DOZEN HARD BLOWS ON THE ARMS EN BODIES OF THE OFFICERS WHO SHOWED GREAT RESTRAINT IN THEIR TACTICS IN THE END IT DIDN'T HELPER CASE THE CHILDBORN DEAD IS NOT IN TRUTH THE CHILD THE JUDGE ROTE IT WAS THAT WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN A CHILD HER COUNT WAS NOCKED DOWN TO SEX MISSUS KENNY WAS OUT OF THE RUNNING LASTLY THERE WAS MISSUS BIGNATO WHO AGAIN HAD NINE CHILDREN BUT ONE WAS STILL BORN AND ANOTHER WAS UNREGISTERED MISSUS MIGNATTO SUGGESTED THAT THERE WAS SOME CONSPIRACY WITH THIS SHE SAID SHE'D REGISTERED THE CHILD HERSELF AT THE PARLIAMENT BUILDING SHEHAS QUOTED TO SAYING IF THEY CAN'T FIND THE RECORD IT'LL BE JUST TOO BAD FOR THEM UP THERE I WILL TEAR THE PARLIAMENT BUILDINGS A PART BEFORE I GIVE UP I'M SUPPOSE TO BE IN THE HOSPITAL NOW WITH ANOTHER BABY COMING BUT I'LL STAY ONMY FEET UNTIL I DROP WERE THIS IS CLEARED UP BUT HER PROTESTATIONS DIDN'T SWAY THE JUDGE AND SHE EVENTUALLY DID GIVE UP AFTER ALL SHE DID HAVE A JOB AND ALMOST A DOZEN MOUTHS TO FEED IT THE END OF TWO YEARS NONE OF THE THREE FAVORITES BOUND UP AT THE FINISH LINE FOUR OTHER WOMEN WITH NINE BABIES EACH ONE EACH OF THESE WOMEN WALKED AWAY WITH WHAT TO DAY WOULD BE ABOUT TWO MILLION CANADIAN DOLLARS WORE ONE AND HALF MILLION NEU ESS DOLLARS MOST WERE LATE COMERS WHO REALLY ONLY BECAME CANDIDATES WHEN THE HEAVY HITTERS WERE ELIMINATED AND THESE FOUR WOMEN HAD SOMETHING ELSE IN COMMON HERE'S ELIZABETH I MEAN THE FAMILIES AT ONE WERE WHIT PROTESTANT FAMILIES WHO WERE ESSENTIALLY MIDDLE PLASS AND WHO HAD AT HOMES THAT WHEN THE REPORTERS WHEN IN TO THEM AN DESCRIBE THE HOMES IT WAS ALWAYS YOU KNOW THE CLEAN AND TIDY HOME AND THE WELL KEP THI IN THE CATHEDO THE FOR RUNNERS THROUGH THE WHOLE RACE WERE WORKING CLASS PEOPLE AND UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE AND THEY HAD VERY AT THE BACK GROUNDS MAYBE IT WASN'T A COINCIDENCE THAT THESE WOMEN DIDN'T WIN MAYBE THEY DIDN'T WIN BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE MEANS TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM AS ELEGANTLY WER MAYBE THE JUDGE WHO DECIDED THE CONTEST HAD HIS FINGER ON THE SCALE IN ITS LAST FOUR YEARS THE PUBLIC'S VIEW OF THE CONTEST THAT TURNED HIS PEOPLE SAW HOW IT PLAYED OUT IT HAD ENCOURAGE THE POOREST WOMEN TO HAVE THE MOST CHILDREN THAT SAT ALARM BELLS OFF FOR A BIG GROUP OF PEOPLE IN WHAT WAS A GROWING AN POPULAR MOVEMENT AT THE TIME EUGENICS KATTY ROOSEVELT WAS INTO EUGENICS ALEXANDER GRANBELL W E B DO BOYS EVEN HELLEN KELLER A REFRESHER OUGENISAS BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE HUMAN SPECIES SOME PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO REPRO DUCE AND YES THAT'S JUST AS CREEPY AS IT SOUNDS AN TE END OF THE CONTEST THEY CAME FORTH AND DROVES TO SAY THAT THE MONEY SHOULDN'T BE GIVEN TO ANY WOMEN HERE'S ELIZABETH THE SOCIAL COMMENTARY WAS A ROUND YOU KNOW WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE AND SHOULD THEY BE WE PRODUCING THE'RE NOT CANADIAN BORN THERE POOR THE'RE NOT THE RIGHT PEOPLE A MINISTER REVEREND CLARE SILCOX SUBMITTED WRITTEN TESTIMONY AGAINST THE PAR TICIPANTS AS QUO UNSPEAKABLE WOMEN AND ARGUE THAT THESE POOR CHILDREN WHAT EVENTUALLY REDUCED WAGES AND LOWER THE STANDARD OF LIVING AND EDITOR FOR A CANADIAN NEWSPAPER SAID THAT THE CONTEST ATTRACTED QUOE THOSE WHOSE PROGENY WOULD BE OF LITTLE USE TO THE STATE ELIZABETH AND CAREAN BELIEVE THAT THIS ENVIRONMEN INFLUENCE THE JUDGE HAT HE ELIMINATED ON TECHNICALITIES ALL THE CONTESTANTS WHO HAD NOT MADE THE RIGHT KINDS OF BABIES HERE'S CAREN YE I DO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS INTENTIONAL I MEAN BECAUSE THEY WEN OS SUCH LAKES TO

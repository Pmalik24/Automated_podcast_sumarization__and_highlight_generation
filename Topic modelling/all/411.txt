WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAPOA SCIENCE SCIENCE PACETOE RI MAN DREU HUBERMEN AND OM OUR PROFESSOR OF NAUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE DISCUSSING DOPAMINE DOPAMINE IS A TOPIC THAT I'VE COVERED BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST AND MANY PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF DOPAMINE MOST PEOPLE KNOW THAT DOPAMINE IS INVOLVED IN PLEASURE TO SOME EXTENT OR ANOTHER AND NOWADAYS PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO APPRECIATE THAT DOPAMINE IS ALSO INTIMATELY INVOLVED WITH MOTIVATION DRIVE AND PURSUIT WHILE TODAY YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN THAT INDEED DOPAMINE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THOSE THINGS BUT YOU ARE ALSO GOING TO LEARN THAT DOAMINE IS CRITICAL FOR OVERCOMING PROCRASTINATION FOR INSURING ON GOING MOTIVATION END INDEED FOR INSURING CONFIDENCE IN FACT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DOPAMINE AND MOTIVATION AND CONFIDENCE AT THE LEVEL OF NEUROBIOLOGICAL CIRCUITRY AND WE ARE GOING TO COVER TOOLS THAT WILL LLOW YOU TO LEVERAGE YOUR DOPAMINE IN ORDER TO HAVE MAXIMUM MOTIVATION TO OVERCOME STICKING POINTS WHICH INCLUDE THINGS LIKE PROCRASTINATION BUT ALSO BY UNDERSTANDING THE NURAL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT RELEASE AND USE DOPAMINE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY BY UNDERSTANDING WHAT ARE CALLED DOPAMINE DYNAMICS THAT IS WHAT GIVES RISE TO BIG PEIAKES IN DOPAMINE OR TROUGHS IN DOPAMINE OR WHAT'S REFERD TO AS OUR BASE LINE LEVEL OF DOAMINE WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE OUR BASE LINE LEVELS OF MOTIVATION AND FEELINGS OF WELL BEING BY UNDERSTANDING HOW THOSE THINGS RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER I ASSURE YOU THAT BY THE END OF TO DAY'S EPISODE YOU WILL BE IN A FAR BETTER POSITION TO UNDERSTAND WHY YOU BECOME AMOTIVATED WHY YOU PROCRASTINY HOW TO INSURE MOTIVATION ON AN ON GOING BASIS AN EVEN HOW TO LEVERAGE EFFORT AND THE DESIRE TO BECOME MOTIVATED AS A WAY TO DO JUST THAT TO BECOME MORE MOTIVATED TODAY'S DISCUSSION IS NOT ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY ALTHOUGH I WILL CENTERE AROUND PRACTICAL EVERYDAY EXAMPLES AND OFFER MANY MANY TOOLS THAT YOU CAN IMPLEMENT IF YOU CHOOSE TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS REALLY ABOUT PULLING A PART THESE THINGS THAT WE CALL MOTIVATION REWARD PLEASURE PROCRASTINATION AND UNDERSTANDING THEM IN TERMS OF THEIR DOAMINE DYNAMICS SO WHETHER YOUVEHEARD ME OR OTHERS TALK ABOUT DOPAMINE BEFORE FOR WHETHER NOT TO DAY IS YOUR FIRST EXPOSURE TO THE TOPIC OF DOPAMINE TO DAY'S EPISODE IS REALLY DESIGNED TO GIVE YOU THE BIOLOGICAL AND PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE SO THAT YOU CAN LEVERAGE YOUR DOPAMINE CIRCUITRY AND YOUR DOPAMINE LEVELS AS WELL AS TOOLS TO A JUST DOPAMINE CIRCUITRY IN LEVELS IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE BEFORE YOU BEGIN I LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRON EFFORT TO BRINGS ZEUROCOSTO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR NOW SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLITES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLIKE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHIDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHISITS IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE PACTELECTROLIKE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT ONE GRAM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDER MILEGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HIDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLITES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'VE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENTE DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT ELEMEMENTE DOCOM SLASH HUBERMEN O KE LET'S TALK ABOUT DOPAMINE WHAT IS DOPAMINE DOPAMINE IS WHAT'S CALLED A NURO MODULATOR WHICH SIMPLY REFERS TO THE FACT THAT IT'S A CHEMICAL THAT MODULATES OR CHANGES THE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY OF OTHER CELLS AND THE SELLS OM REFERRING TO OR NURONS NURONS ARE JUST NERVE CELLS SO YOU HAVE A BRAIN AND A SPINAL CHORD AND THE NURONS IN YOUR BRAIN AND SFINAL CORT CONNECT TO ONE ANOTHER AND THEY CONNECT TO DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE BODY INCLUDING BASICALLY EVERY ORGAN OF YOUR BODY AND EVERY ORGAN OF YOUR BODY COMMUNICATES BACK TO YOUR BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD THROUGH DIRECT OR IN DIRECT PATHWAYS FOR INSTANCE YOU HAVE NURONS IN YOUR GUT THAT SENSE WHAT SORTS OF NUTRIENTS YOU'VE EATEN OR DRINK AND THEN SEN NURAL SIGNALS ELECTRICAL SIGNALS UP TO THE BRAIN AND INDEED THAT WHOLE PROCESS HAPPENS TO BE MODULATED BODY DOPAMINE DOPAMINE AS A NUROMODULATOR HAS THE BASIC PROPERTY OF EITHER RAMPING UP INCREASING OR DECREASING THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER NURONS AND THAT'S DONE BY ADJUSTING THINGS LIKE ELECTRICAL POTENTIALS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT THAT WE REALLY WON'T GO INTO THIS EPISODE BUT THAT I PROMISE TO GET INTO IN DETAIL IN A FUTURE EPISODE IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THE BILE CHEMISTRY AND BILE PHYSICS OF NURONS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT SO WE HAVE THIS NUROMODULATOR DOPAMINE AND WE KNOW THAT THAT NUROMODULATOR CAN INCREASE OR DECREASE THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER NURONS SO THEN WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHERE IS DOPAMINE RELEASED IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND WHAT SPECIFIC TYPES OF NURONS IS IT IMPACTING IN OTHER WORDS WHAT SPECIFIC TYPES OF FUNCTIONS DOES DOPAOMINE HAVE SO THER ARE BASILY FIVE CIRCUITS WITHIN THE BRAIN THAT USE DOPAMINE AS THE PRIMARY NUROMODULATOR AND THOSE FIVE CIRCUITS ENGAGE DIFFERENT BUT RELATED FUNCTIONS SOMELY GO THROUGH THEM ONE BY ONE RELATIVELY QUICKLY GIVING YOU A LITTLE BIT OF NOMIN CLATER AND SOME SENSE OF WHAT EACH OF THOSE CIRCUITS LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT IT DOES THE FIRST CIRCUIT IS THE SO CALLED NIGRO STRIATAL PATHWAYS SO IN THE BACK OF THE BRAIN THERE IS AN AREA CALLED SUBSTANTIA NIGRA SO NAMED BECAUSE THE NURONS THEY ARE ACTUY VERY DARK THEY ACTUALLY CONTAIN PIGMENT YOUD BE ABLE TO SEE THIS IF I WERE TO SLICE UP A BRAINU S TWO DARK REGIONS IN THE BACT THAT SUBSTANTIA NIGRESS SUBSTANTIANIGRA CONTAINS O NURONS THAT ARE CHALK A BLOCKFULL OF DOPOMINE BUT THEY RELEASE THAT DOPOMINE IN A BRAIN STRUCTURE CALED THE STRIATUM THE STRITUM IS INVOLVED IN MOVEMENT BOTH THE INITIATION OF MOVEMENTS AND THE SUPPRESSION OF MOVEMENTS IN SO CALLED GO ACTION AND NOGO SUPPRESS ACTION PATHWAYS TOPIC FOR A FUTURE POTCAST THE SECOND BRAIN CIRCUIT THAT USES AND LAVERAGES DOPOMIN TO A GREAT EXTENT IS A SO CALLED MESO LYMBIC PATHWAY NOW YOU'LL ALSO IN A MOMENT HEREABOUT THE MESO CORTICAL PATHWAY SO TO DAY OMONA TALK ABOUT THESE SOMEWHAT INTERCHANGEABLY AT TIMES BUT WHERE ITS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO DIFERENTIATE BETWEEN THEM I WILL DO THAT BOTH OF THESE PATHWAYS INITITE FROM A SET OF NURONS AND THE SO CALLED VENTUAL TAGMENTAL AREA OR V T A I WILL USE THAT ACRINUM V TER THE VTE FUNCTIONS IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH A DIFFERENT BRAIN STRUCTURE CALLED THE NUCLEOS ECCUMBENTS OR N A I DON'T THINK I'LL CALL IT AN A TO DAL TALK ABOUT VTIER VENTUAL TAGMENTAL AREA AND I'LL TALK ABOUT NUCLEAS ECUMBENTS FORSAKE OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION YOU CAN LUMP THOSE TOGETHER IF YOU WANT NURONS IN THOSE AREAS PROJECT A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PLACES BUT IN THE MISOLYMBIC PATHWAY THOSE NURONS ARE PROJECTING TO AREAS OF THE BRAIN LIKE THE HYPOFALMUS WHICH SITS RIGHT ABOVE THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH AN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF BASIC FUNCTIONS THINGS LIKE MAINTAINING YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE FOR LEBIDO IN THE PURSUIT OF SEC FOR HUNGER FOR THE GENERATION OF SIGNALS TO THE PETUITARY GLAND THAT CAUSE THE RELEASE OF HORMONS AND OTHER THINGS INTO THE BLOOD STREAM SO THE CONNECTIONS WHICH I SOMETIMES REFER TO ATS PROJECTIONS FROM THE NURONS IN THE VTIER AND NUCLEAS ECUMBENTS TO THE HYPOTHALMUS ARE BASICALLY USING DOPOMI TO MODULATE THE OUTPUT OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN THIS HYPOTHALEMUS THAT CONTROLS A LOT OF WE COULD CALL THEM PRIMITIVE FUNCTIONS BUT THERE REALLY BASIC FUNCTIONS FOR SURVIVAL NOW THE OTHER PATHWAY OUT OF THE VTIER AND NUCLEAS ECCUMBENTS IS TO THE CUARTEXT THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED MESO CORTICAL PATHWAY SO THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT PATHWAY OUT OF THE VTER AND NUCLES ECCUMBENTS AND THE ONE I JUST DESCRIBED A MOMENT AGO THE PATHWAY O'M TALKING ABOUT NOW THE MESA CORTICAL PATHWAY FORJECTS TO THE PREFRONTAL CARTEX WHICH IS A STRUCTURE THAT MANY OF YOU PERHAPS HEARD OF BUT EVEN IF YOU HAVEN'T IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THIS IS AN AREA THAT RESIDES RIGHT BEHIND YOUR FOREHEAD AND THAT IN HUMANS COMPARED TO OTHER SPECIES IS GREATLY EXPANDED IN TERMS OF ITS SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF FUNCTION SO IT'S INVOLVED IN EVERYTHING FROM PLANNING AND EXECUTING OF ACTION TO MAKING GOOD OR BAD DECISIONS DEPENDING ON CONTEXT IN FACT ONE OF THE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS OF PREFRONTAL QUARTEXS IS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND CONTEXT WHETHER OR NOT FOR INSTANCE YOU ARE ALONE IN YOUR ROOM WHERE CERTAIN BEHAVIORS ARE APPROPRIATE WHETHER NOT YOU ARE AT WORK WHERE OTHER BEHAVIORS ARE APPROPRIATE UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE CONTEXT IS AND THEREFORE WHAT SORTS OF ACTIONS NEED TO BE GENERATED AND SUPPRESSED IN FACT A GUEST ON THE HUBERMAN LADPOTCAST AND THIS IS A GUEST WHOSE EPISODE HAS AN AIRED YE DESCRIBE THIS BEAUTIFULLY HE'S A NURO SURGEON AND HE SAID THE WAY TO THING ABOUT THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX IS IT'S BASILYAN AREA OF THE BRAIN THAT SAYS OR NO NOT NOW TO OTHER BRAIN REGIONS IN ORDER TO SUPPRESS ACTION WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE DAMAGE TO THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX OFTEN CAN'T SUPPRESS THEIR IMPULSES IS SO THE PATHWAY FROM VITIER AND NUCLISICCUMBENTS TO THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR TODAY'S DISCUSSION BECAUSE WE ARE LARGELY GOING TO BE DISCUSSING MOTIVATION DRIVE PURSUIT PROCRASTINATION AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH OUR FEELING IS ABOUT CONTEXT WHETHER NOT WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING OR NOT WHETHER NOT WE FEEL WE SHOWEDER WE SHOULDANT WHETHER NOT WE FEEL WE FAILED THE LAST TIME OR THERE'S A HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS THE NEXT TIME PREFRONTAL QARTECX DOES MANY MANY THINGS BUT WHEN THINKING ABOUT DOPAMINES ROLL IN THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX THAT IS WHEN THINKING ABOUT THIS MESO CARTICAL PATHWAY WE REALLY WANT TA THING ABOUT HOWDOPAMINE IS ACTIVATING OR CHANGING OR PROPENSITY TO DO CERTAIN THINGS AND GET US INTO ACTION IRL PREVENT US FROM DOING CERTAIN THINGS AND PREVENT ACTION SO BASICALLY YOU CAN THINKG ABOUT THE MESO QUARTICAL PATHWAY AS THE CIRCUIT THAT REALLY GOVERNS ALL OF THE MAJOR CHOICES THAT YOU'RE GONG TO MAKE IN LIFE ABOUT WHAT TO DO IN WHAT NOT TO DO TOWARD YOUR GOALS AND AWAY FROM THE THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO AVOID NOW THE FOURTH DOPAMINE PATHWAY IN THE BRAIN HIS THE SO CALLED TUBEREAU INFONDIBULAR PATHWAY AND THIS IS NOT ONE WE ARE GOING TO FOCUS ON TOO MUCH TO DAY THIS IS A PATHWAY THAT RELATES TO CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE BRAIN AND YOUR PETUITARY GLAND YOU'R PETUITARY GLAND BEING THAT GLAND THAT'S AS I MENTION A MOMENT AGO IS ALSO RECEIVING INPUT FROM THE HYPOFALMAS AND IS REALLEASING AF BUNCH OF HORMONES INTO YOUR BLOODSTREAM THINGS LIKE LUTINIZING HORMON FOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE THINGS LIKE A MALANA CORTAN HORMON THESE ARE HORMONS THAT ARE IMPACTING EVERYTHING FROM THE FUNCTION OF THE OVERY AND FEMALES TO THE FUNCTION OF THE TESTES AND MALES 'SGOVERNING THINGS LIKE A CARTUS ALL RELEASE UNDER STRESS THIEROID HARMONA MEANING ITS REGULATNG FIRORY HORMONE RELEASE AND ON AN ON DOPAMINE HAS A VERY POWERFUL IMPACT ON THE OUTPUT OF THE PETUITARY AGAIN THAT'S PROABLY A TOPIC FOR A FUTURE EPISODE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT IN REVIEWING THE DIFFERENT BRAIN CIRCUITS THAT USE DOPAMINE AS A NERMOGELAYER THAT I MENTION THAT ONE THEN THERE'S A FIFTH ONE AND THIS FIFTH ONE IS NOT OFTEN DISCUSSED AND AGAIN WON'T BE THE MAIN TOPIC OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION BUT FOR THOROUGHNESS AND FOR CLARITY IT'S IMPORTAN TAT WE MENTION IT THIS IS THE CIRCUIT WITHIN YOUR RETINA THAT IS THE PICRUST LIKE LINING OF NERAL TISSUE ON THE BACK OF YOUR EYE BECAUSE REMEMBER YOUR EYES ACTUALLY PART OF YOUR BRAIN THAT GOT EXTRUDED FROM YOUR BRAIN DURING DEVELOPMENT KNOWS TWO EYES THAT YOU SEE IN THE MIRROR AND THAT YOU SEE ANOTHER PEOPLE AR ACTUALLY TWO PIECES OF CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM AND WITHIN THE RETINA WHICH IS THE NORAL PORTION OF THE EYE WITHIN THE NERLRETINA DOPAMINE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ADAPTING TO DIFFERENT LIKE CONDITIONS SO THAT YOU CAN SEE CLEARLY BOTH IN THE EVENING AND WHEN IT GETS DARKER YOU CAN STILL SEE A BIT AND IN THE MORNING WHEN IT'S VERY BRIGHT YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO SEE CLEARLY YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM DOES IT FOR YOU IN ONE OF THE WAYS THAT IT DOES THAT IS THROUGH THE NEROMAGULATER DOPAMIE SO TO DAY WE ARE NOT GOING TO DISCUSS THE RETINAL DOPAMIN PATHWAYS OR THE TUPERINFINDIBULAR DOPAMIN PATHWAYS AND WE WON'T REALLY TALK SO MUCH ABOUT THE NIGROSTRITAL PATHWAYL SAY ONE MORE THING ABOUT IT THEN I'LL LEAVE IT ALONE WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE MESO QUARTICAL PATHWAY WE MIGHT TOUCH ON THE MY ISO LIMIT PATHWAY A LITTLE BIT AS WELL SO TO DAY WE'RE MOSTLY GOING TO TALK ABOUT MESO CARTICAL CIRCUITRY AND FUNCTION AND DOPAMING WITHIN THE MESO QARTICAL CIRCUIT AND THE REASON THAT WE'RE DOING THAT IS THAT TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS REALLY ABOUT MOTIVATION PROCRASTINATION GOALL SETTING AND PURSUIT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT NEITHER DOPAMIE NOR THE MESO QUARTICAL CIRCUIT CARES ABOUT ANY SPECIFIC GOAL OR PURSUIT THIS IS A CIRCUIT THAT USES DOPAMINE IN ORDER TO PURSUE ANYTHING NOW OF COURSE SOME PEOPLE HAVE A GREATER PROPENSITY TO PURSUE THINGS LIKE WORK OR GOALS AND ATHLETICS OR RELATIONSHIPS OR COMMINATION OF THOSE OTHER PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY HAVE A GREATER PROPENSITY TO PURSUE THINGS LIKE DRUGS OF ABUSE WHAT ARE DRUGS OF ABUSE DRUGS OF ABUSE TEN TO BE DRUGS THAT INCREASE LEVELS OF DOPAMIN TO THE EXTENT THAT OTHER TYPES OF PURSUITS IN LIFE THAT ARE ADAPTIVE FOR US LIKE WORK RELATIONSHIPS SCHOOL ET CETERA BECOME IRRELEVANT IN FACT THE DEFINITION OF A DICTION THAT I USE AND THAT I BELIEVE REALLY MATCHES THE NOR BIOLOGY VERY WELL IS THAT A DICTION IS A PROGRESSIVE NARROWING OF THE THINGS THAT BRING US PLEASURE HEALTHY FUNCTIONING IN THE MESO CARTICAL PATHWAY HOWEVER ALLOWS US TO TOGGLE OR SWITCH BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF PURSUITS OF ALL THE SORTS THAT I'VE MENTIONED EARLIER SO IF WE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THAT MESO QARTICAL PATHWAY WORKS JUST A LITTLE BIT IN PARTICULAR WHEN DOPAMING IS RELEASED AND WHEN IT'S NOT RELEASED WHAT DOPAMIN DOES WHEN IT'S RELEASED TO OUR SENSE OF MOTIVATION IN DRIVE AND IF WE CAN UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW OUR RECENT DOPAMIN HISTORY THAT IS WHETHER NOT THERE IS DOPAMINE IN OUR SYSTEM ALREADY DICTATES WHETHER NOT WE ARE GOING TO FEEL MOTIVATED IN THE NEXT FIVE TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES HOURS DAYS AND WEEKS THAT IS ALL VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND I PROMISE I'LL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU IN A SIMPLE WAY BUT I WANT YOU TO GET A CIRCUIT INTO YOUR MIND I WANTS YOU TO INVISION THAT THERE ARE THESE NURONS LITTLE NERVE CELLS IN THE V TIER AND NUCLY SICCOMMONS THOSE NURONS MAKE DOPAMINE THEY SEND THEIR PROJECTIONS THAT WE CALL AXONS WHICH LIKE LO WIRES AND THEY CAN RELEASE DOPAMINE INTO THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX AND NOW YOU ALREADY KNOW BECAUSE YOU LEARNED IT A FEW MINUTES AGO THAT THE PREFRONTA QUARTEX THEN CAN INSURE THAT CERTAIN BEHAVIORS TAKE PLACE AND OTHER BEHAVIORS DO NOT TAKE PLACE THAT SH OR QUIETING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WITH THAT IN MIND LET'S NOW TAKE A LOOK IT HOW DOPAMING IS RELEASED AND LET'S KEEP TWO THINGS IN MIND THERE ARE PIKS IN DOPAMINE THAT IS DOPAMING IS RELEASED INTO THE FRONTAL QUARTEX WHERE HAS THESE EFFECTS OF ACTIVATING OR SUPPRESSING ACTION AND WE CAN THINK OF TH OSE AS PEAKS IN DOPAMINE SO IM I CALL IT A SPIKE THAT MEANS AN INCREASE AND THEN A DECREASE IF I CALLE A PEAK ITS AN INCREASE AND THEN A DECREASE THERE CAN ALSO BE TROUGHS IN DOPAMINE WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT WELL WE HAVE PEAKS AN DOPAMINE AND THAT PEAK AN DOPAMIN CAN RISE UP AND THEN GO BACK TO WHAT WE CALL BASELINE OR THERE CAN BE A TROUGH IT CAN GO BELOW BASE LINE SO THE TWO KEY THINGS TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT DOPAMINE IS THAT WE HAVE DOPAMIN PEAKS THAT ARE TRIGGERED BY CERTAIN BEHAVIORS CERTAIN COMPOUNDS DRUGS OR SUBSTANCES FOOD ET CETERA AND THAT WE HAVE A DOPMINE BASE LINE ARE DOPAMIN BASE LINE IS OUR RESEVOIR OF DOPAMINE IT'S HOW FULL OR EMPTY ARE DOPAMINE POOL IS AND THAT DOPAMINE POOL IS THE POOL OF DOPAMINE THAT WE USE IN ORDER TO CREATE THOSE DOPAMIN PEAKS AND WHEN THOSE PEAKS COME DOWN SOMETIMES THEY GO BACK TO BASE LINE AND SOMETIMES THEY GO TO LOWER THAN BASELINE WHICH WE CALL THE TROUGH IF ANY OF THIS SEEMS CONFUSING WANT YOU JUST TO IMAGINE A WAVE POOL THIS IS AN ANALOGY THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME BY ONE OF OUR PODCAST GESS WHICH IS DOCTOR CALGELETTE WHOS AN OBECITY SPECIALIST AND IN WORKS ON NUMBER OF THINGS RELATE TO ENDRIKAN HORMON FUNCTION INCLUDING TOSTOSTERONE ESTERGEN IN BOTH MEN AND WOMEN WHEN A CHICK OUT HIS EPISODES ON HORMON HEALTH OTHER FASCINATING AN ACTIONABLE I USE A TREMENDOUS WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE AND HE HAS THIS ANALOGY FOR HOW DOAMINE WORKS IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY AND THAT ANALOGY IS THIS NOTION OF A WAVEPOOL YOU'VE EVER SEEN A WAVEPOOLETS BASICALLY A CONCRETE POOL AND THERE ARE WAVES WITHIN IT CAN'T DOG THOSE WAVES CAN BE OF DIFFERENT HEIGHTS SO THEY CAN BE LITTLE RIPPLES WE CAN THIN OF THOSE AS LITTLE MENI PEAKS OR THEY CAN BE BIG WAVES THAT CAN BEREALLY BIG CRASHING WAVES IF THE HEIGHT OF THOSE WAVES AND THE FREQUENCY OF THOSE WAVES IS VERY VERY LARGE SOME OF THAT WATER WHICH HERE I MUSING AS AN ANALOGY TO DOPAMINE CAN SLOSH OUT OF THE WAVEPOOL AND THE BASE LINE DROPS HOWEVER IF THOSE PEAKS ARE SMALL ENOUGH OR THEY ARE SELDOM ENOUGH WELL THEN THE BASE LINE THAT IS THE WATER LEVEL IN THAT POOL STAYS MORE OR LESS CONSTANT I THINK THIS IS AN EXCELLENT ANALOGY FOR HOW DOPAMIN WORKS IND THE MES OF QUARTICAL PATHWAY AS IT RELATES TO MOTIVATION AND PURSUIT AN ALL THOSE SORTS OF THINGS BECAUSE WE REALLEAN TO THINK ABOUT HOW THE PEAKS AND THE BASE LINE RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER  THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT THE PEAKS IN THE BASE LINE ARE NOT INDEPENDENT OF ONE ANOTHER THEY RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER SO NOW YOU HAVE IN YOUR MINE A WAVEPOOL AND JUST UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU GET A GREAT BIG HUGE WAVE MAY BE ONE OF THEM WIL CRASH OUT IN SOME OF THAT WATER WILL SPLASH OUT THE BAS LINE WILL GO DOWN A LITTLE BIT BUT IF YOU GET BIG PEAK AFTER BIG PEAK AFTER BIG PEAK PRETSOON YOUR CAN EMPTY THAT POOL WHEREAS IF YOU HAVE SMALLER WAVES WERE LESS FREQUENT BIG WAVES WELL THEN THE BASELINE WILL STAY RELATIVELY CONSTANT SO LET'S THINK ABOUT DOPAMINE PEAK S AND BASE LINES AND LET'S REMEMBER THAT FOR EVERY PEAK THERE'S A TROUGH I MEAN BY THAT WELL WHEN YOU HAVE A WAVE YOU ALSO HAVE THE BOTTOM OF THE WAVE WHEN YOU HAVE A MOUNTING YOU HAVE THE BOTTOM OF THE MOUNTIN WHEN WE THINK ABOUT DOPAMINE PEAKS AND DOPAMIN BASE LINES WE HAVE TO INCLUDE THAT TROUGH BECAUSE THAT TROUGH THAT IS THELEVEL OF DOPAMINE BELOW BASE LINE REALLY DICTATES WHETHER NOT YOU ARE GOING TO FEEL MOTIVATED TO PURSUE SOMETHING OR NOT SO 'M GONG TO GIVE YOU A VISUAL IN YOUR MIND THE VISUAL IN YOUR MIND IS AND INCREASE IN DOPAMINE THAT'S TRIGGERD BY YOUR DESIRE FOR SOMETHING AND REALLY COULD BE YOUR DESIRE FOR ANYTHING IF YOU'RE HUNGRY AND YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HI REALLY WANT A SANDWICH REALLY WANT O ONTHING WHAT SANDWICH WHAND I WANT RIGT NOW REALLY NICE ROAST BEEF SANDWHICH ON SOURDOUGH WITH A SLICE OF SWISS TO MATOS SLICE A PICKLE HERE I'M DESCRIBING THE SANDWICH THAT I WOULD WANT SO IF YOU'RE HUNGRY AND YOU'R THINKING ABOUT THAT DOPAMINE STARTS RISING THIS IS CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND DOPAMI IS NOT JUST RELEASED WHEN WE GET THE REWARD WHEN WE GET THE THING THAT WERE PURSUING DOPAMINE IS RELEASED INANTICIPATION OF WHAT WE WANT THAT INCREASE IN DOPAMINE IS BY NO HAPPENSTANDS NO MISTAKE RELATES ALSO TO OUR PROPENSITY AND DESIRE TO MOVE REMEMBER EARLIER I TOLD YOU THERE'S A SEPARATE CIRCUIT OF DOPAMIN THAT TRIGGERS MOVEMENT AND THAT WHEN IT'S TOPLEDED IS CAUSING THINGS LIKE DEFAS ITS AN MOVEMENT RELATED TO PARKINSONS OR OTHER MOVEMENT DISORDERS WELL THAT'S NOT PURE COINCIDENCE THAT'S BECAUSE DESIRE AND THE NEED TO MOVE IN ORDER TO PURSUE AND REACH GOALS OR ONE IN THE SAME PROCESS SO IF I DESIRE A SANDWICH OR I DESIRE A CUP OF COFFEE OR I DESIRE SOME WATER WHEN I'M THIRSTY THERE'S AN INCREASE IN DOPAMINE THAT WE COULD CALL LITTLE MINI PEAK AND DOPAMINE BUT THEN HERE'S THE KEYTHING TVERY SOON AFTER I REALIZE MY DESIRE FOR SOMETHING THAT PEAK THAT WAS CAUSED BY THE DESIRE COMES DOWN AND DROPS BELOW BASE LINE BELOW THE LEVEL OF DOPAMINE THAT IT WAS PRIOR TO VEN THINKING ABOUT THE SANDWICH FOR THE COFFEE OR THE GLASS OF WATER AND IT'S THAT DROP BELOW BASE LINE THAT TRIGGERS MY DESIRE TO GO OUT AND FIND THAT SANDWICH THAT COFFEE THAT WATER OR THAT BLANK INSERT WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU HAPPEN TO DESIRE ACTION OR SUBSTANCE OF ANY KIND OR PERSON ET CETERA SO THAT DROP BELOW BASELINE IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE WHOLE PROCESS AND THAT DROP BELOW BASELINE WAS TRIGGERD BY THE PRECEDING PEAK SO LET'S SAY THAT I DESIRE A SANDWICH THERE'S AN INCREASE IN DOAMINE THEN VERY QUICKLY IT COMES DOWN BELOW BASELINE JUST A LITTLE BIT NO'M IN PURSUIT OF THE SANDWICH I'M LOOKING FOR WHERE I CAN GET THAT SANDWICH I CAN ORDER IT PERHAPS TO BE DELIVERED I CAN GO OUT AND FIND IT NOW IS THE STAGE IN WHICH I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT STIMULY THAT IS THE THINGS IN MY ENVIRONMENT THAT SIGNAL WHEATHER NOT I'M LIKELY TO GET THAT SANDWICH OR NOT AN SO FOR INSTANCE IF I WERE TO GOIN TO MY PHONE AND ORDER FOOD ON A NAP WERE WALKED DOWN THE STREET AND SEE THE SIGNE FOR A DELLY THAT'S A CUE THAT I'M LIKELY TO RELIEVE THAT DROP IN DOPOMINE AND GET NOT JUST BACK TO BASE LINE BUT THAT I'LL GET A PEAK AND DOPOMIN AND INDEED THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IF I FIND THAT DELLY I GOING TO THE DELLY THEY'RE OPEN THEY'RE MAKING THE SANDWICH THAT I WANT THEY MAKE MY SANDWICH AND GREAT I GET THAT SANDWICH AND THAT SANDWHICH WILL HAVE SOME DEGREE OF INHERID REWARD TO IT SOME DEGREE OF A MY LIKING IT OR NOT LIKING IT SO LIT SAY I LIKE IT THE BEST SIN WHICH I'VE EVER HAD BUT ALL I'M DOING IS COMPARING MY DESIRE FOR THAT SANDWICH TO THE SANDWICH THAT I ACTUALLY GOT AND ATE AN CHANCES ARE IT'S GOING TO RELIEVE THAT CRAVING MEANING IT WILL TAKE THAT DOPOMING THAT HAD FALLEN BELOW BASELINE UP UP BACK TO BASE LINE AND IF I LIKE THE SANDWICH IT'S GOING TO INDEED INCREASE THAT DOOMINE AGAIN TO ANOTHER PEAK NOW IF I LOVE THE SANDWICH LIKE IT'S THE MOST DELICIOUS THING THAT I'VE EVER TASTED MY ENTIRE LIFE WELL THEN I'LL GET A BIG PEAK IN DOPOMINE WHEN I CONSUME THAT REWARD HOWEVER CHANCES ARE THAT  SANDWICHIS MORE O LESS AS I EXPECTED TO BE WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD I'LL LEAD IT AND I'M FINE WHAT O I MEAN BY FINE WELL THERE'S A CONCEPT CALLED REWARD PREDICTION ER REWARD PREDICTION ERROR SAYS THAT THE DOOMING THAT IT IS EXPERIENCE THAT IS THAT'S RELEASED FROM THE VITIER AND NUCLY ACCUMBONS IS GOING TO BE OF A CERTAIN VALUE AND THAT VALUE IS GOING TO BE COMPARED TO THE DESIRE AND EXPECTATION OF WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO GET SO IF YOU TAKE WHAT YOU ACTUALLY GOT MINUS WHAT YOU EXPECTED THAT'S REWARD PREDICTION AIR SO IF THE SANDWICH IS BASICALLY WHAT I EXPECTED TO GET FINE DOPOMING COMES DOWN BASILY TO A BASELINE LEVEL THAT'S PRETTY STANDARD FOR ME AND IS BASELY THE BASELINE LEVEL I HAD BEFORE I EVER THOUGHT ABOUT THE SANDWICH IT ALL IF THE SANDWHICH COMPLETELY SURPRISES ME AND IS COMPLETELY AMAZING JUST AN AMAZING SANDWICH WELL THEN THE LEVEL OF DOPOMING THAT I EXPERIENCE WHEN I CONSUME THAT SANDWICH I'S GOING TO BE EVEN GREATER AND IT'S GOING TO BE THAT MINUS WHAT I EXPECTED SO THERE IT'S A BIGGER REWARD PREDICTION ER IN THE DIRECTION OF HIGHER PEAK BI CONSUMING THE SANDWICH AND THEN OF COURSE THERE'S THE OTHER POSSIBILITY WHICH IS THE DELLY'S CLOSED OR THE SANDWHICH THEY MAKE ME IS LOUSY OR DOESN'T TASTE GOOD OR SOMETHING HAPPENED IN THE  CONSUMING OF THAT SANDWICH THAT JUST MAKES A BAD EXPERIENCE IN WHICH CASE IF WE TAKE THAT REWARD EXPERIENCED MINUS REWARD PREDICTED FROM THE INITIAL CRAVING WELL THEN IT'S GOING TO BE LESS THAN WHAT I EXPECTED AND THEREFORE THE BASE LINE DROPS BELOW WHERE IT WAS PRIOR TO EVEN DESIRING THE SANDWICH CASE SO ALL OF THIS MIGHT SEMALOBIT COMPLICATE ITS ALL VERY SIMPLE DESIRE FOR THINGS INCREASES DOPOMINE BUT THEN OUR LEVEL OF DOPOMIN DROPS BELOW BASELINE AND IT'S THAT DROP LLOBASE LINE THAT TRIGGERS THE MOTIVATION TO BRING THAT DOPAMING LEVEL BACK OP BY GOING IN PURSUING THE THING THAT YOU WANTED IN THE FIRST PLACE OF COURSE AS THIS IS HAPPENING YOU'RE NOT CONSCIOUS OF YOUR DOPAMINE LEVELS YOU EXPERIENCE THIS AS CONTECT DEPENDENT CRAVING AND PURSUIT BECAUSE REMEMBER THE PREFRONTAL QUARTECTS IS INVOLVED IN CONTECT SETTING AND CRAVING AND PURSUIT BECAUSE IT RELATES TO ACTION AND MOVEMENT WHICH IS ONE OF THE GENERAL FEATURES OF THE DOPAMIN SYSTEM YOU CAN START TO SEE HOW THIS IS A BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNE SYSTEM AND YOU CAN ALSO SEE HOW IT'S A PERFECT SYSTEM FOR DESIRE AND PURSUIT OF ANYTHING NOT JUST SANDWHICHES AS I'M GIVING YOU IN THIS SOMEWHAT TRIVIAL BUT EVERY DAY AND THEREFORE APPLICABLE EXAMPLE SO JUST BY UNDERSTANDING REWARD PREDICTIONERROR AND ESPECIALLY BY UNDERSTANDING THAT A CRAVING TRIGGERS A PEK AND DOPAMINE THAT MAKES YOU MOTIVATED BUT THEN DROPS YOUR LEVEL OF DOPAMINE BELOW BASELINE WHICH MAKES YOU EVEN MORE MOTIVATED YOU ARE ALREADY HALF WAY THROUGH THE CONCEPTIABLE ASPECT OF TO DAY'S PODCAST BECAUSE IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHY FOR INSTANCE WHEN YOU INITIALLY WANT SOMETHING R YOU THINK YOU WANT SOMETHING IT PUTS YOU INTO MOTION BUT THEN PRETTY QUICKLY YOU'RE STARTING TO FEEL THE PAIN OF NOT HAVING THAT AND THAT IS ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO YOUR DESIRE TO PURSUE THAT THING THIS IS A SUBTLE EFFACT BUT IF YOU WATCH FOR IT YOU'LL START TO SEE IT OR EXPERIENCE IT WITHIN YOURSELF YOUR CRAVING FOR THINGS IS NOTCIOUS ABOUT CRAVING FOR THOSE THINGS PERSAY IT'S ALSO A DESIRE TO RELIEVE THE PAIN OF NOT HAVING THOSE THINGS AND IF YOU CAN INTERNALIZE THAT AND START TO DEVELOP IN AWARENESS AROUND IT YOU WILL BE IN AN AMAZING POSITION TO LEVERAGE ALL SORTS OF ASPECTS OF THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO INCREASE YOUR MOTIVATION ESPECIALLY WHEN THINGS GET REALLY HARD OR WHEN YOU HAVE THE PROPENSITY TO PROCRASTINATE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WILL GET INTO A LOBIT LATER IN THE PODCAST I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED A G ONE IS A VITAMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEENDS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THEREASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIC GREENS ONTS ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO ME N THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GOD IS VERY IMPORTANT ITS POPULATED BY GUP MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE IMMUN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIOTICS ENOTHLETIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLETIC GREENS CONTAINS AN NUMBER OF ADAPTEGINS VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL F MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTES CRIPT IF YOU LIKE TO TRYATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN DOCK CAM SLASH HUBERMINE AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD AND THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND T 'LL GIVE YOU A YEARS SUPPLY OF VITEMAN D THREE K TOO AGAIN THAT'S AT LET IT GREENSTOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE VIFRY TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEARS SUPPLY O VITEMEN D THREE K TO NOW I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE DYNAMICS OF DOPOMINE RELEASE WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL AND THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE NEVER COVERED ON ANY SOCIAL MEDIOPOSED OR ON ANY PODCAST EITHER THIS ONE OR IS A GUEST ON OTHER POD CASS BECAUSE ON THE FACE OF IT IT MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE TOO DETAIL THAT WISLY TELLING ME ALL THIS ISN'T IT JUST ENOUGH TOE KNOW THAT THEIR PEAKS AND TROUGHS AND BASE LINES AND DOPAMINE WHAT TURNS OUT THAT IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAN WHAT THAT PEAK AND TROUGH ARE REALLY ABOUT IN OTHER WORDS WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING WHEN WE ZUME IN ON THAT PEAK AND TROUGH YOU'LL BE IN AN AMAZING POSITION TO OVERCOME PRECASTINATION AND ESSENTIALLY PURSUE ANY GOALS IN AN ON GOING BASIS SI'M VERY SIDTE TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH YOU BECAUSE I DO THINK TAT HAS TREMENDOUS ACTIONABLE POWER WHEN I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE RELATES TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FINDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE MOSTLY OVER THE LAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS ALTHOUGH TO BE QUITE DIRECT MOST OF THEM LAST FIVE YEARS AND IT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT THE PEAK AND TROUGH AND BASE LINE THAT I TALKED ABOUT A MOMENT AGO THAT ARE ASSOCIATE WITH CRAVING THEY LOOK LIKE A PEAK FOLLOWED BY A TROUGH FOLLOWED BY A RETURN TO BASE LINA MAY BE ANOTHER PEAK IF YOU GET THE REWARD OR A DROT BELOW BASE LINE IF YOU DON'T OR YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU GOT BUT IF WE WERE TO ZUME IN ON THAT PEAK AND THE REWARD ANOTHER WORDS REALLY ZUME IN ON THE WHOLE PROCESS AND START THINKING ABOUT THE CIRCUITRY THAT IS THE NURONS IN V TIER AND NUCLE ECUMBONS AND HOW IT RELATES TO THE FRONTAL QUARTEC IN A BIT MORE DETAIL WHAT WE DISCOVER IS NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING WHAT WE DISCOVER IS THAT WHENEVER WE'RE PURSUING SOMETHING WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR CUES AS TO WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE ON THE RIGHT PATH TO ACHIEVE THAT THING AND WE ARE ALSO SETTING A MINE SET OR A CONTECT WITHIN ARE BRAINS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE CONFIDENT OR PESSIMISTIC AS TO WHETHER NOT WE'RE OING TO ACHIEVE THAT THING NOW THIS IS VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR ANY ONE OUT THERE WHO FINDS IT HARD TO GET MOTIVATED AND STAY MOTIV ATED IT'S ALSO VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR ANYONE WHOSE PSYCHOLOGICALLY MINDED IN ANY WAY IT OUGHT TO BE PSYCHOLOGIST BUT PSYCHOLOGICALLY MINDED IN ANY WAY AND WONDERS WHY IS IT THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST SO MOTIVATED AND OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SUCH TROUBLE WITH MOTIVATION WHY IS IT THAT SOME PEOPLE REQUIRE PERFECT CONDITIONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THINGS AND OTHER PEOPLE JUST SEEM TO MANAGE TO PURSUE THINGS NO MATTER WHAT IT ALSO RELATES TO THE FACT THAT SOME OF US ARE VERY GOOD AT ACHIEVING OUR GOALS IN ONE CONTEXT AND NOT SO MUCH IN ANOTHER SO HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND I'LL STAY WITH THE EXAMPLE OF THE ROASTBEF SANDWICH JUST BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE THAT IN MINE BUT YOU CAN REPLACE ROASTBEEF SANDWICH WITH ESSENTIALLY ANY GOAL THE CUE THAT WE'RE GOING TO LIKELY GET WHAT WE WANT SO FOR INSTANCE THE SIGN THAT THERE'S A DELLY ON THE CORNER OR THAT I OPEN MY PHONAN THAT THERE'S AN AP THAT REPRESENTS A RESTAURANT THAT SELLS THE PARTICULAR SANDWICH THAT I LIKE THAT CUE AS I MENTION BE FOR INCREASES DOPAMIE YOU SEE THAT OK AND SUBCONSCIOUSLY THERE'S ALREADY A SIGNAL THAT'S INITIATED BY THAT DOPAMINE THAT I'M ON THE RIGHT PATH THEN AS I MENTION DOPAMINE DROPS BELOW BASE LINE THAT'S FURTHER CONTRIBUTING TO MY DESIRE TO GO PURSUE THAT SANDWICH EITHER WITH MY THUMBS ON MY PHONE THROUGH THE AP OR WITH MY FEET AND WALKING TO THE DELLY STANDING IN LINE AND SO FORTH THEN AS I MENTION BEFORE THERE IS A PEAK IN DOPAMINE OF VARYING HEIGHT DEPENDING ON HOW SATISFYING I FIND THE REWARD TO BE WHEN I ACTUALLY GET THAT SANDWICH GET THAT GOAL NOW KEEP IN MINE THERE IS SOME TIME DELAY BETWEEN THE CUE THE AP THE DELLY ET CETERA AND WHEN I GET MY SANDWICH THAT GAP IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT THING SO IN PURSUING A O FOR YOUR DEGREE ITS CAN BE FOUR YEARS IF THE DIPLOMA IS YOUR GOAL IF IV IT'S EXAMIN YOUR STUDDYING FOR IT MIGHT BE A WEEK LONG AND THERE WILL BE MANY OTHER SIGNALS IN BETWEEN THAT INITIAL CUE THAT HEY THE THE REWARD LIKELY LIES DOWN THIS PATH IN THIS TEXT BOOK IN ON ON YOU KNOW THIS DATING AP OR AT THAT DELLY THERE MANY OTHER CUES THOSE CUES COME IN SUBCONSCIOUSLY AND INVOLVE EVERYTHING FROM HOW LONG THE LINE IS AT THE DELLY TO YOU KNOW WHETHER NOT YOUR YOU NO SEEING THE TYPES OF PEOPLE ON A DATING AP THAT YOU LIKE TO SEE WHETHER NOT THE RESPONDING TO YOU WHETHER NOT SOME ONE'S TEXTING YOU BACK OR NOT ALL OF THOSE CUES ARE INTEGRATED AND ADJUSTING YOUR BASELINE LEVEL OF DOPAMINE ALL THE TIME AS YOU GO TO PURSUE THAT GOAL SO WHAT THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM DOES IS IT DOESN'T JUST COMPARE THE HEIGHT OF THE PEAK AT THE BEGINNING RIGHT THE I DESIRE THAT TO THE REWARD THAT YOU GOT WE TALKED ABOUT REWARD PREDICTION ER THAT'S THE THAT'S THE CAN OF FIRST GRATE VERSION OF REWARD PREDICTION ERE IT'S ALSO TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN BETWEEN AND ALL OF THAT IS SERVING AS A CUE FOR THE EVENTUAL REWARD AND ALL OF THAT IS FUNALLY INTO WHAT WE CALL REWARD PREDICTION ERE IN OTHER WORDS THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM IS VERY GOOD AT SUBCONSCIOUSLY PARSING WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT HAPPENE BETWEEN WANTING AND GETTING AND THAT'S PART OF THE LEARNING THAT DOPAMINE ACHIEVES AND INDEED THEREARE SPECIALIZED CIRCUITS FROM THE V TE AND NEUCLE ECCUMBENTS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN JUST THE LEARNING OF HOW WE ACHIEVE OR DON'T ACHIEVE SPECIFIC TYPES OF REWARDS THAT WE DESIRE SO THIS IS CALLED REWARD CONTINGEON LEARNING BECAUSE IT'S LEARNING THE CONTINGENCIES OF WHAT LED UP TO A REWARD OR WHAT DIDN'T LEAD UP TO A REWARD AT THE SAME TIME END IN PARALLEL THERE'S AN ON GOING RELEASE OF DOPAMINE IN THE BACKGROUND AND THAT ON GOING RELEASE OF DOPAMINE THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LEARNING IS REALLIGE A SORT OF A PROPELLER THAT'S DRIVING US IN THE DIRECTION OF WHATEVER IT IS THAT WERE TRYING O PURSUE SO I REALIZE FOR SOME OF YOU THIS MIGHT SEEM LIKE UNNECESSARY OR PERHAPS EVEN AN OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF DETAIL BUT IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE SIMPLE YOUR BRAIN IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED PRIOR TO GETTING OR NOT GETTING A REWARD AND IT'S COMPARING WHAT YOU WANTED COMPARED TO WHAT YOU GOT AT THE SAME TIME THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM INITIATES A MOTIVATION SIGNAL THAT TAKES YOU THROUGH THAT ENTIRE ROUND OF PURSUIT AND THOSE THREE THINGS THEREIS THE STIMULUS THE DESIRE THAT I WANT THAT THAT'S THE FIRST THING LEADS TO THAT PIQUE THE PIQUE DROPS A A BIT BELOBASE LINE AND IT TRIGGER'S MOTIVATION THE MOTIVATION IS THE SECOND THING THE MOTIVATION IS DOPAMIN RELEASE ALSO BUT FROM A SEPARATE SET OF NURANS WITHIN THIS CIRCUIT DRIVING YOU FORWARD AND THE ENTIRE TIME THAT IT'S DRIVING YOU FORWARD IT'S PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S THERE ALONG THE WAY EVEN IF YOU DON'T REALIZE IT CONSCIOUSLY AND THEN THERE'S THE REWARD ITSELF OR THE LACK OF REWARD ITSELF SO THOSE THREE COMPONENTS THE LEARNING CONTINGENCY WHICH AS TO DO WITH THE STIMULUS AND THE REWARD AND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN BETWEEN AND THE PROPELLER NATURE OF DOPAMINAS O'M REFERRING TO IT THOSE ALL COMBINE INTO A TOTAL LEARNING SO THAT AFTER YOU GET THE SAMWHICH OR AFTER YOU FINISH THE EXAM OR AFTER YOU OUT ON A DATE OR AFTER OU DO ANYTHING THAT YOU DESIRE TO DO THAT SYSTEM THAT ORIGINATES IN THE VTER AN NUCLY SECUMBENTS AND GOES UP TO YOUR QUARTEX IT LEARNED IT LEARNED MANY THINGS IT LEARNED THAT CONTINGENCY BETWEEN STIMULUS AND DESIRE MOTIVATION AND WHETHER NOT YOU SUCCEEDED OR NOT IT'S BASICALLY A SCORE BOARD FOR HOW YOU DID GIVEN WHAT JUST HAPPEND SO ACTUALLY IT'S ALL VERY SIMPLE IN FACT IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND EVEN JUST HALF OF WHAT I JUST SAID YOU ARE NOW IN A FAR BETTER POSITION TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING FROM A DICTION TO MOTIVATION TO PROCRASTINATION ND IT WILL MAKE SENSE OF ALL THE TOOLS THAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT NEXT WHICH WILL ALLOW YOU TO OVERCOME PROCRASTINATION POINTS TO OVERCOME DEFISITS IN MOTIVATION AND INDEED TO RESET YOUR MOTIVATION IN AN ON GOING WAY SO THAT YOU CAN REACH YOUR GOALS O CASE SO LET'S TAKE EVERYTHING THAT I JUST TOLD YOU AND SET IT ASIDE IT'S STILL IMPORTANT BUT LET JUST SET IS THAT YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT ANY OF THOSE DETAILS OR NAMES OR ANYTHING LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT A DICTION BECAUSE IN BIOLOGY AND IN PSYCHOLOGY FRANKLY IT REALLY OFTEN PAYS TO THINK ABOUT THE EXTREMES FIRST AND THEN WORK OUR WAY TOWARDS MORE TYPICAL CIRCUMSTANCES WITH THAT SAID ADDICTION UNFORTUNATELY IS VERY COMMON NOWADAYS I JUST HEARD A STATISTIC IN FACT THAT THERE IS AN EIGHTY EIGHT ZERO PER CENT INCREASE IN ALCOHOL USE DISORDER AMONG WOMEN IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS TALK TO LUIBIT ABOUT THIS IN THE EPISODE THAT I DID ABOUT ALCOHOL AND HEALTH CAN I ONE BE VERY CLEAR I'M NOT SOMEBODY THAT IS COMPLETELY AGAINST ALCOHOL FOR ADULTS PROVIDED THEIR NOT ALCOHOLICS TURNS OUT TWO DRINKS A WEEK PROBABLY FINE HEALTH WISE ZERO WOULD BE B ETTER IF WE'RE HONEST ZERO IS BETTER THAN ANY ALCHAL BUT TWO DRINKS A WEEK IS PROBABLY FINE PASS TO DRINKS YOU START RUNNING IN TO PROBLEMS AND YET MANY MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE MALE AN FEMALE ALIKE SUFFER FROM ALCHAL USE DISORDER ALSO CALLED ALCALISM THE SAME IS ALSO TRUE FOR THINGS LIKE MET THEM FEDAMINE OR COKANE OR OTHER TYPES OF SUBSTANCE EDICTIONS AND THE SAME IS ALSO TRUE FOR A LOT OF BEHAVIOR OR WHAT ARE SOMETIMES CALLED PROCESS EDICTIONS THINGS LIKE SEX EDICTION OR VIDIOGAME EDICTION OR ANY TYPE OF BEHAVIOR THAT FRANKLY IS LEVERAGING THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM BUT THAT ENGAGES THIS PROGRESSIVE NARROWING OF THE THINGS THAT BRING SOME ONE PLEASURE SUCH THAT NOTHING ELSE IS REALLY SALIENT NOTHING ELSE IS REALLY PULLING THEM IN IN THE WAY THAT THEIR VIDIO GAMES OR SEC OR PORNOGRAPHY OR ALCOHOL PICIOUR SUBSTANCE OR YOU KNOW BEHAVIOR THAT YOU SEE OUT THERE OR HOPEFULLY NOT BUT THAT YOU MIGHT SUFFER FROM AN DICTION TO SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN EDDICTION WELL A DICTION INVOLVES DOPAMNE AMONG OTHER THINGS OFTEN THAE OPIOT SYSTEM ET CETERA BUT IF WE RE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT'S THE STIMULUS IN AN INDICTION AND WHAT'S THE PEAK IN DOPAMINE AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT PEAK IT ALL BECOMES VERY CLEAR AS TO WHYEDICTION HAPPENS AND WHY IT SO PERNICIOUS SO FOR INSTANCE LESS TAKE COCNE COCANE CAUSES DRAMATIC INCREASES IN DOPAMIN VERY VERY FAST SO IF SOMEBODY CRAVE'S COKANE WHAT ARE THEY CRAVING THEIR CRAVING THAT DOPAMING PEAK THEIRE CRAVING THE INCREASE LEVEL OF ALERTNESS THEIR IN CRAVING A NUMBER OF THINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FEELING OF BEING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE DROG BUT THE STIMULUS FOR IT SIMPLY BECOMES THAT LINE OF COKANE OR IN THE CASE OF CRACK THAT CRACKROCK THAT THE'RE GEN A SMOKE GOD FORBID THEIR MAIN LINING IT OTHE'R SHOOTING INTO A VAIN WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY SNORT SMOKE OR INJAC COKANE AND DOPAMINE LEVELS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY GO UP UP UP UP UP TO A VERY HIGH PEAK CAS SO THE THE TIME GAP BETWEEN THE STIMULUS AND THE DOPAMINE IS VERY VERY SHORT SO SHORT IN FACT THAT THERE'S REALLY NO OTHER CONTINGENCIES IN BETWEEN THAT THE MEZO CORTICAL SYSTEM HAS TO LEARN IN FACT WHAT IS THE SYSTEM QUAT INQUO LEARN IT LEARNS COCANE EQUALS MASSIF AMOUNTS OF DOPAMINE EQUALS FEELING EUPHORIC AND ENERGETIC ET CETERA AND IN DOING THAT IT REINFORCES THE WHOLE CIRCUIT SO THAT THAT SHORT WE CAN EVEN SAY HYPER SHORT CONTINGENCY IS REALLY WHAT THE SYSTEM WANTS SO MUCH SO THAT LONGER CONTINGENCIES OF SAY PUTTING IN THE HARD WORK OF YOU KNOW GENERATING A FITNESS PROGRAM OR A PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMME FOR R CELL FOR A A EDUCATION PROGRAM WHICH TAKES NOT JUST MANY DAYS BUT MANY WEEKS AND YEARS WELL NONE OF THAT IS GOING TO LEAD TO PIECE IN DOPAMINE THAT ARE AS HIGH AS THE PEK AN DOPAMINE ASSOCIATED WITH COKANE SO THAT TELLS US SOMETHING CRITICAL IT IS BOTH THE DURATION BETWEEN DESIRE AND EFFECT AND WHEN I SAY EFFECT I MEAN THE REWARDING PROPERTIES OF DOPAMINE THAT ARE EXPERIENCED THAT'S IMPORTANTE SO VERY SHORT GAPS TEACH THE SYSTEM TO EXPECT IND WANT SHORT GAPS MAKES IT VERY HARD TO PURSUE THINGS THAT TAKE LONGER SO WHEN WE SAY IT'S THE SHORT OR IN THIS CASE HYPER SHORT DISTANCE WE'RE TIME BETWEEN THE STIMULUS AND THE DOPAMINE WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IF WE WERE TO PLOT THIS OUT ON A ON A BORDER ON A PIECE OF PAPER IS THE STEEPNESS OF THE RISE OF THAT PEAK IT'S VERY VERY STEEP THE PEAK IN DOPAMINE IS COMING UP VERY FAST AFTER THE DESIRE AND IN ADDITION TO THAT AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT THE HIER THE PEAK IN DOPAMINE AND THE FASTER THE RISE TO THAT PEAK THE FURTHER BELOW BASE LINE THE DOPAMINE DROPS AFTER THE DRUG WARS OFF CA SO IN THE CASE OF COKANE IT'S A VERY FAST AND VERY LARGE RISE IN DOPAMINE FOLLOWED BY A STEEP DROP AND VERY DEEP TROUGH IN DOPAMINE BELOW BASE LINE YOU SAY OK SO THERE'S PLEASURE THAN THERE'S LACK OF PLEASURE AH BUT IT'S WORSE THAN THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOTJIOUS LACK OF PLEASURE IF YOU RECALL WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT EARLIER THAT DROP BELOW BASE LINE TRIGGERS THE DESIRE AND THE PURSUIT FOR WHAT FOR MORE AND SO THIS SETS IN MOTION A VICIOUS SLOOP WHERE PEOPLE START PURSUING PEAKS IN DOPAMINE THAT CAN COME VERY FAST WITHOUT MUCH EFFORT AND THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH ADDICTION START TO TAKE HOLD A THERE'S A SIMPLE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS AND TO REMEMBER IF YOU WANT TO AVOID THIS WHOLE THING I MEAN THE FIRST ONE IS OBVIOUS DON'T DO COCANE DON'T TRY IT DON'T USE IT CERTAINLY DON'T GET ADDICTED TO IT S AR ALL SORT OF ONE IN THE SAME FRANKLY I DON'T KNOW MANY PEOPLE THAT A DESPITE OPINIONS TO THE CONTRARY THAT USE COKANE RECREATIONALLI THAT DON'T AT SOME POINT RUN IN TO EITHER A FINANCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL PHYSICAL OR SOME OTHER PROBLEM THE OTHER THING THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO KEEP IN MIND AND THIS WAS DISCUSSED IN MY COLLY DOCTOR ONALEMPKI'S BOOK DOPAMINATION AND ON THIS PODCAST EXCELLENT BOOK BY THE WAY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IF YOU HAVEN'T READ IT ALREADY IT'S A FASCINATING A EXPLORATION INTO DOPAMINE AS IT RELATES TO ADDICTION NOT JUST DRUG ADICTION BUT OTHER TYPES OF ADDICTION GETN THE NAME OF THAT BOOK IS DOPAMINATION WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO IT IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS THE OTHER THING THAT HAPPENS AFTER THOSE BIG FAST INCREASES IN DOPAMINE CAUSED BY THINGS LIKE COKANE IS AFTERWARDS WHEN IT QUICKLY DROPS BELOW BASE LINE IT TAKES A MUCH LONGER TIME TO GET BACK TO THE ORIGINAL BASE LINE THEN IT DID PRIOR TO USING THE DRUG AND WORSE STILL IS THAT THE PEAKS IN DOPOMINE THAT ARE CREATED FROM MORE CONSUMPTION OF COKANE LEADS TO PROGRESSIVELY LOWER PEAKS AND DEEPER TROUGHS BELOW BASE LINE SO THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS SHIFTING AWAY FROM PLEASURE AND MORE TO PAIN AND THE DESIRE FOR PURSUIT OF THE DRUG OL THIS IS A TERRIBLE SITUATION AND IT'S A TERRIBLE SITUATION THAT'S NOCIOUS UNIQUE TO KOKAINE IN FACT IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT THE AVERAGES AND AGAIN THESE ARE AVERAGES OF THE HEIGHT OF THE PEAKS IN DOPOMINE THAT ARE CREATED BY DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES AND THE RATES AT WHICH THOSE PEAKS TAKE PLACE CAS REMEMBER THE TIME TO PEAK IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS HOW HIGH THAT PEAKE GOES WE SEE SOME PRETTY INTERESTING NUMBER SO FOR INSTANCE AND AGAIN THESE ARE AVERAGES BASED ON NEROIMAGING COMBINED WITH OF WHAT ARE ALL PET SKANS ON POSITRONOMISSION TOMOGRAPHY COMBINE WITH BLOOD DRAWS AND A NUMBER OF OTHER DATA FROM BOTH ANIMAL AND HUMAN STUDIES I FIND IS THAT AT BASE LINE JUST GOUNT UPON A BACKGROUND OF NO OF DRUG TAKING OF ANY KIND THE NURONS IN THE VENTURITING MENTAL NUCLY SOCOMEN'S AREA ARE FIRING AT A RATE OF ABOUT THREE TO FOUR PER SECOND RELEASING DOPOAMINES O THAT'S YOUR BASE LINE OF DOPAMINE RELEASE YOURE YOUR FOREBRAN IS ALWAYS SEEING A LITTLE BIT OF DOPAMINE FROM FROM THAT SYSTEM IF YOU WERE THEN TO ANTICIPATE FOOD AND YOUR RELATIVELY HUNGRY THAT WOULD DOUBLE SO THIS PROBABLY HAPPENED WHEN YOU DECIDE ET LUNCH TO DAY IF YOU ARE HUNGRY PRIOR TEATING LUNK IT DOUBLES IN ANTICIPATION OF THE FOOD AND THEN DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH YOU ENJOYED THAT FOOD IT MIGHT TRIPLE OR QUADRUPLE IT MIGHT BE LOWER THAN IT WAS DURING THE ANTICIPATIONS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE SO THERE'S AN APPROXIMATE DOUBLING UNDER CONDITIONS OF DESIRING AND CONSUMING FOOD LESTIC NICOTINE IS THE NEXT EXAMPLE FOR PEOPLE THAT USE NICOTINE EITHER SMOKING VAPING SNUFFING OR DIPPING ALL ROUTS OF NICOTINE ADMINISTRATION THAT COVERED IN OUR EPISODE ABOUT NICOTIN HERE'S ABOUT A ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT INCREASE IN THE RATE OF DOPOMINERON FIRING KOKINE IS GOING TO INCREASE THE RATE OF DOPOMINE OUTPUT INTO THE PROVONTIAL QUARTECS BY ABOUT A THOUSAND PER CENT EY SO WHAT YOURE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE IS A TENFOLD INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF OF DOPAMI THAT'S RELEASED INTO THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEC AS MEASURED BY THE RATES OF FIRING THESE DOPAMIE NURONS METHEM FEDEMINE IS GOING TO BE ANYWHERE FROM A THOUSAND PER CENT ANYWHERE UP TO TEN THOUSAND PERCENT IT REALLY VARIES DEPENDING ON THE POTENCY OF THE DRUG AND A FEW OTHER FACTORS AND HERE'S WHERE PERHAPS IT GETS A LITLE MORE INTERESTING SOME OF YOU ARE PROBABLY WONDERING ABOUT KAFFINE OR ABOUT SECS OR ABOUT VIDIO GAMES NOW THERE THE NUMBERS VERY TREMENDOUSLY AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT ACROSS THE BOARD NOT JUST FOR KAFFINE SEX VIDIO GAMES BUT ALSO FOR NICATINE ALCKOHALL AND OTHER OF SUBSTANCES AND WHAT WE CALL MOTIVATED BEHAVIORS SOME OF WHICH ARE PART OF A HEALTHY LIFE LIKE EATING AND REPRODUCTION  PROVIDED IT YOU KNOWAGE APPROPRIATE CONTECTS APPROPRIATE YO SPECIES APPROPRIATE CONSENTUAL WELL THEN A WE CONSIDER IT ADAPTIV IT'S NOT WELL THEN CONSIDER NOT MALADAPTIVE SOME PEOPLE WILL SIT DOWN TO PLAY OF IDIO GAME THEY REALLY LIKE VIDIO GAMES AND AS THEIR SITTING DOWN THEY WILL EXPERIENCE A FIVEFOLD INCREASE IN THE RATE OF DOPOMING OUTPUT FROM THEIR NUCLY SUCCOMBENTS FOR OTHER PEOPLE IT'S GOIN TO BE A TENFOLD INCREASE FOR OTHER PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO DON'T LIKE VEDOGAMES VERY MUCH OUNIVANING AGAINST THEM I DON'T DISLIKE THEM BUT IT DOESN'T DO MUCH FOR ME IT MIGHT NOT CAUSE ANY INCREASE WHATSOEVER IT MIGHT EVEN CAUSE A DECREASE IN DOPOMING SO THERE'S A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY FOR SEX IT TURNS OUT TO BE A RANGE SO THEY TYPICAL RANGE THAT SITED IN THE LITERATURE IS ANYWHERE FROM A FOUR TO FIVEFOLD INCREASE IN THE RATE OF DOPOMINE NEAR ON FIRING HOWEVER THERE ARE CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS FOR WHICH THAT NUMBER IS DOUBLED KAFINE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE BECAUSE KAFFINE HAS THE PROPERTY OF NOT JUST CAUSING THE RELEASE OF DOPOMING BUT INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF DOPOMING RECEPTORS OVER TIME AND THERE AREN'T A LOT OF EXCELLENT MEASUREMENTS OF THE AMOUNT OF DOPOMING RELEASED AS A FUNCTION OF CAFINE ANTAKE IN DIFFERENT POPULATIONS OF HUMANS IT'S MOSTLY ANIMAL STUDIES BUT WHAT WE THINK BASED ON THE GISHTALL BASED ON THE OVERALL PICTURE OF THE LITERATURE IS THAT IT'S AN APPROXIMATE DOUBLING OF THE DOPOMINE SIGNALING THAT'S COMING OUT OF THE VITIE NUCLIS ACCOMMENS TO PREFRONT OL QUARTEX WHEN WE ANTICIPATE AND WHEN WE DRINK OUR COFFEE AGAIN I REALLY WANTO BE CLEAR THAT FOR ALL OF THESE THINGS THESE ARE RELATIVE LEVELS AND THEIRE DISTRIBUTIONS IF WE WERE TO PLOT THEM OUT ON PAPER YOU'UD SEE THAT THESE ARE NOT BARGRAPHSIES ARE OVERLAPPING CURVES TO SOME EXTENSS OF SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE A MORE DOPOMING RELEASE OR LESS DOPOMING RELEASE FROM ONE BEHAVIOR OR SUBSTANCE HOWEVER IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT COCANE METHEM PHETAMINE EVEN HEROINE FOR THAT MATTER ARE WAY OUT ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE CURVE CAUSING ENORMOUS INCREASES IN DOPOMINE VERY QUICKLY AND THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE DESCRIBED HAVE AGAIN A DISTRIBUTION THAT IS MORE LEFT WARD SHIFTED ON THIS IMAGINARY PLOT THAT I'M CREATING TO LOT OF INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY HOWEVER IT'S FASCINATING THE DOPOMINE IS THE SINGLE MOLECULE THAT'S CAUSING THE CRAVING AND PURSUIT AND EXPERIENCE OF ALL OF THESE SUBSTANCES IN BEHAVIORS AND THE LEARNING OF ALL OF THAT CRAVING PURSUIT AND ACTUAL EXPERIENCE IS WHAT PREDICTS WHETHER NOT WE WILL REENGAGE REUSE THAT SUBSTANCE OR NOT RE ENGAGE IN A BEHAVIOR OR NOT AND HOW FREQUENTLY WE WILL DO THAT SO THAT'S A DICTION BUT IF YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THE HEIGHT OF THOSE PEAKS IN DOPOMINE AND THE RATE TO REACH THOSE PEAKS ND THE TROUGHS THAT RESOLVED AND HOW LONG THE TROUGHS TAKE TO GET BACK TO BASELINE IF YOU UNDERSTAND OR LITTLE OR ALL OF THAT YOURE REALLY IN A TERRIFIC POSITION TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO LEVERAGE THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM FOR THE PURSUIT OF HEALTHY GOALS AND BEHAVIORS I SHOULD MENTION ONE THING ABOUT RECOVERY FROM A DICTION WHICH IS THAT THE RESET OF ALL THAT DOPOMINE CIRCUITRY FROM UNHEALTHY TO HEALTHY OFTEN INVOLVES DEPENDING ON THE EDICTION THIRTY DAYS OF COMPLETE ABSTINENCE THAT THIRTY DAYS OF COMPLETE ABSTINENCE INEVITABLY INVOLVES A LOT OF PAIN IN DISCOMFORT AND CRAVING ANXIETY ANSOMNIA ET CETERA THAT RELATES TO THE BIG TROUGH IN DOPAOMINE THAT INEVITABLY OCCURS NOW OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME EDICTIONS SUCH AS SEVERE ALCOHOLEDICTION AND IN SOME CASES OPIO EDICTION THAT IMMEDIATE AND SUSTAINED ABSTINENCE CANNOT BE USED AS THE TOOL SOMEBODY REALLY NEEDS TO WORK WITHIN ADICTION SPECIALIST AND SOMETIMES THERE NEDS TO BE A TAPERING OFF OF THE SUBSTANCE FOR OTHER DICTIONS IT CAN BE QOTIQO COAL TURKEY AND THEN OF COURSE THEIRE OTHER DICTIONS PARTICULAR FOOD AND SEX BUT SOMETIMES EVEN THINGS LIKE VIDIO GAMES FOR WHICH THE DESIRED OUTCOME IS NOT NECESSARILY TO ELIMINATE THE BEHAVIOR COMPLETELY BUT TO SET SOME CONSTRAINTS AROUND THE BEHAVIOR SO THAT IT'S NOT OCCURRING TO THE EXCLUSION OF OTHER PLEASUREFUL THINGS IN LIFE AND ADAPT OF THINGS IN LIFE AND FOR THAT THERE IS THE REQUIREMENT FOR WHAT ARE CALLED BINDING BEHAVIORS WILL GET BACK TO BINDING BEHAVIORS LATER OF BINDING BEHAVIORS ARE BEHAVIORS IN WHICH PEOPLE BIND THEIR BEHAVIOR A ROUND OF PARTICULAR SUBSTANCE USE OR AROUND A PARTICULAR BEHAVIORAL EDICTION LIKE SEX OF DEOGAMES ET CETERA IN SPACE AND OR TIME IN SPACE MEANING THEY MIGHT ONLY ENGAGE IN THOSE PARTICULAR O BEHAVIORS IN CERTAIN PLACES IN CERTAIN TIMES WHEN IT'S CONTEXT APPROPRIATE AN THERE NUMEROUS EXAMPLES OF BINDING BEHAVIORS IN SPACE AND TIME IT ALL HAS TO DO WITH CLAMPING OR DIRECTING WHEN THE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE DOPOMINE RELEASING BEHAVIOR IS GOING TO OCCUR SO WHAT'S HAPPENING WHEN PEOPLE DECIDE TO GO COL TURKEY OR THEY USE THESE BINDING BEHAVIORS WELL WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT PEOPLE ARE ENGAGING THE SPECIFIC CIRCUITRY WITHIN THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEXT THAT AS I MENTION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE ARE IMPORTANT FOR CONTEXT SETTING SO IN THE CASES OF BINDING BEHAVIORS THE PREFRONTAF QUARTEX IS ESSENTIALLY GETTING TRAINED UP TO UNDERSTAND THAT OKE CERTAIN THINGS LIKE FOOD OR PERHAPS SEXS OR OF PERHAPS VIDIO GAMES THERARE O K IF THEY ARE DONE OR CONSUMED IN APPROPRIATE AMOUNTS OR IN PARTICULAR CONTEXT THAT REQUIRES THE CONTEXT SETTING GOLD DIRECTED BEHAVIOR THAT THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX AS RESPONSIBLEO CASE O FOR THE LAST TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES WE'VE BEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT ADDICTION AND ACTUALLY THIS IS NOT AN EPISODE ABOUT ADICTION HOWEVER IF YOU UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DOPOMINE DYNAMICS ANIN EDICTION YOU CAN LEVERAGE THAT KNOWLEDGE TOWARDS HEALTHY ADAPTEV GOAL PURSUIT AND ACHIEVING YOUR GOALS SO LET'S THINK ABOUT THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT GENERATES DOPOMING PEAKS WHAT GENERATES DESIRE TO PURSUE GOALS WHAT CAUSES ARE READ OUBT OF WEATHER NOT WE ACHIEVED A GOAL OR NOT IN OTHER WORDS WHAT ALLOWS US TO LEARN HOW TO PURSUE GOALS OF DIFFERENT KINDS NOT JUST GET GOOD AT ACHIEVING ONE KIND OF GOAL BUT REALLY UNDERSTAND AND GET REALLY REALLY GOOD AT SETTING GOALS AND PURSUING GOALS OF DIFFERENT KINDS THAT ARE ADAPTOV INDIFFERENT AREAS OF LIFE IN BECAUSE WE ALL ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PURSUE GOALS IN UM SCHOOL WORK RELATIONSHIPS FITNESS MENTAL HEALTH AND ON AND ON IN ORDER TO BE OUR BEST SELVES THAT'S CLEAR WELL ALL OF THAT IS POSSIBLE USING THE SAME BASIC SET OF DOPAMINE CIRCUITS AND THE SAME BASIC DYNAMICS OF DOPAMINE SO FOR INSTANCE IF WE ARE GOING TO FEEL MOTIVATED AT ALL THAT IS IF WE ARE GOING TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING OR HAVE ANY PERIOD OF TIME DURING OUR DAY IN WHICH WE FEEL LIKE WE ARE CAPABLE OF PURSUING GOALS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A HEALTHY LEVEL OF BASELINE DOPAMIE IN OTHERWORDS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE ENOUGH DOPAMINE IN THE WAVEPOOL ENOUGH WATER IN THE WAVEPOOL THAT IS BEFORE WE CAN GENERATE ANY WAVES OR PEAKS IN DOPAMINE LET ALONE TROUGHS AND THE REST SO HOW DO WE ACHIEVE A HEALTHY BASELINE LEVEL OF DOPAME WELL THERE WE CAN REALLY LOOK TO SOME FOUNDATIONAL PRACTICES PERACTISES THAT PERHAPS YOU'VE HURT ABOUT ON THIS PODCAST BEFORE THAT TO SOME OF YOU MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE MUNDANE ALTHOUGH SOME OF THEM ARE A BIT MORE SOPHISTICATED MAY BEVEN ESOTERIC THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE CAN ALL CONTROL THESE THINGS AND THEY DON'T REQUIRE PURCHASING ANYTHING BUT THEY DO REQUIRE SOME DEGREE OF REGULAR UP KEEP AND EFFORT THOSE THINGS INCLUDE WHAT I CALL THE VERY BASICS NOW THE VERY BASICS I'M PUT IN THE CONTECTS OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION ARE THE THINGS THAT PUT WATER IN THE WAVEPOOL THOSE ARE GOING TO BE GETTING SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OF QUALITY SLEEPYACH NIGHT SOMETHING THAT WE'VE DONE SEVERAL EPISODES ON AND N HAVE ON LINE TOOL KITS FOREST YOU CAN SEE THE MASTER YOUR SLEEP EPISODE THE PERFECT YOUR SLEEP EPISODE THE LIGHT IN HEALTH EPISODE FYOU WANT SKIP ALL THAT IN JUST GET RIGHT TO THE TOOLS WE HAVE A OF SLEEP TOOL KIT OR IT'SIC HALY CALL THE TOOL KT FOR SLEEP YOU CAN ACCESS AT HUBERMAN LAPDOK CALM COMPLETELY ZERO COST YUJUST GO THERE AND DOWNLOAD THAT TOOL KIT GETTING SUFFICIENTSLY BE TO NIGHT LITERALLY RESTORES YOUR DOPAMINE RESERVES IT ALLOWS DOPAMINGTO BE PRESENT AND FOR YOU TO HAVE A LEVEL OF BASELINE DOPAMINE THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO EVEN CONSIDER YOUR GOALS IN ANY KIND OF MEANINGFULLER REASONABLE WAY SECOND THERE ARE PRACTICES THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE TO INCREASE YOUR BASELINE LEVEL OF DOPAMINE THAT ARE INDEPENDENT OF SLEEP BUT ARE SIMILAR TO SLEEP AND I LIKE TO REFER TO THESE AS NON SLEEP DEEP REST THIS IS NOT MEDITATION THEREIS ACHALLY VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT MEDITATION OF THE TRADITIONAL KIND OF YOU NOW SITTING EYES CLOSES THIRDEYES SENT FOCUSING ON YOUR A THIRD I CENTERE WHICH IS THE SAREO BEHIND YOUR FOREHEAD THERE IS VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT THAT INCREASE IS LEVELS OF DOPAMIE THERE IS A PLACE FOR MEDITATION IN THE CONTECTS OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION BUT I'LL REPEAT MEDITATION ITSELF IS A FOCUSING EXERCISE IT IS NOT KNOWN TO INCREASE DOPOMINE HOWEVER NON SLEEP DEEP REAST SO ALLED ANESTI ARE VERY SIMILAR ALTHOUGH DIFFERENT TO WHAT SOMETIMES CALLED YOGAN NEDRA WHICH IS WHERE YOU LIE THERE YOU DO A SORT OF BODY SCAN SOME LONG EXAIL BREATHING AND ESTIARS VERY SIMILAR YOU CAN FIND A LINK TO A ZERO COST ANESTI ARE ON UTUBE IT'S A TEN MINUTE LONG ON THERE ALSO TWENTY AND THIRTY MINUTE ON OUT THERE ALSO ON YOU TWO BUT ILL PROVIDLING TO THE TEN MINUTE ONE THOSE HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DOPOMINE IN YOUR DOPOMINE RESERVES BY UP TO SIXTY FIVE PER CENT WHICH IS A REMARKABLE NUMBER SO QUALITY SLEEP NON SLEEP DEEP REAST ACH A YOGONEDRA VERY POWERFUL WAYS TO KEEP YOUR BASELINE LEVEL OF DOPOMINE AT A SUFFICIENT LEVEL IN ADDITION TO THAT NEUTRITION NO DOUBT PLAYS A ROLE IN YOUR BASELINE LEVEL OF DOPOMINE BECAUSE TYROSINE THE EMINOACID IS THE RATE LIMITING ENZINE FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF DOPOMINE TYRACINE IS PRESENT IN VARYING LEVELS AND DIFFERENT FOODS YOU CAN LOOK THOSE UP ON LINE YOU SIMPLY AP PUT IN A SEARCH FOR ON TYRACINE LEVELS IN DIFFERENT FOODS EVERYTHING FROM PARTICULAR CHEESES LIKE PARMAGON CHEESE US HIGH LEVELS OF TYROSENE A CERTAIN MEET SCERTAIN NOT CERTAIN VEGETABLES ITHOUT GETTING INTO DETAILS IN SPECIFICS YOU CAN FIND THOSE THERE BUT YOU NEED PROPER NUNUTRICION AND THEREFORE NEUTRIANTS IN PARTICULAR TYROSINE IN ORDER TO HAVE SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF BASELINE DOPOMINE THE THIRD THING ON THE LIST AND AGAIN THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE COME BACK TO ALMOST EVERY EPISODE BUT I DON'T THINK THEY CAN BE REPEATED ENOUGH BECAUSE THESE ARE REALLY THINGS THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SKIP ADAY HERE OR THERE IF YOU GET SICK ORE YOUR TRAVELING ORE YOU HAVE SOME MAJOR LIFE EVENT BUT REALLY EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS WE RENEED TO RE UP OUR SLEEP WE NEED TO RE UP OUR NUTRIANTS EVEN IF YOU'RE FASTING YOURE RE UPIN YOUR NEUTRANS FROM STORD SOURCES WITHIN YOUR BODY THE THIRD THING IS SUNLIGHT MORNING SUNLIGHT IN PARTICULAR V N EXTENSIVE EPISODES ABOUT THIS CHECK OUT THE EPISODE ON LIGHT IN YOUR HEALTH IF YOU WANT ALL THE DETAILS BUT YOU WANT TO TRYINE VIEW SUNLIGHT AS EARLY IN THE DAY AS POSSIBLE FIVE TO TEN MINUTES ON A CLEAR DAY MINIMUM TEN TO TWENTY MINUTES ON A CLOUDY DAY MINIMUM TWENTY A THIRTY MINUTES ON A VERY OVERCAST DAY MINIMUM WITH OUT SUN GLASSES DON'T STARE AT THE SUN PLEASE DON'T DAMAGE YOUR EYES LOOK OFF SLIGHTLY OFF FROM THE SUN BUT YES YOU WAN A FACE EASTWARD TOWARDS THE SUN AND ON THOSE CLOUDY DAYS THAT'S ESSPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO DO WHY WELL VIEWING MORNING SUNLIGHT INCREASES CORTIS ALL EARLY IN THE DAY WHICH IS EXCELLENT BECAUSE YOU WANT CORTIS ALL ELEVATED EARLY IN THE DAY AND YU WANT IT LOWER LATER IN THE DAY AND BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SELLS IN YOUR EYE THAT SEND SUNLIGHT SPECIFICALLY MORNING SUNLIGHT BELIEVE OR NOT THAT HAPPENS AND SIGNAL TO YOUR HYGPOTHALMUS AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE HYPOTHALMUS AND THE PATUITARY AND OTHER ENDERCRAN ORGANS IT SETS IN MOTION A DOPOMINE RELATED CASCADE IN NEROMODULATORS DOPOMINE AND HORMONES THAT LEAD TO STATES OF WELL BEING ELEVATED MOOD ALERTNESS ET CETERA THROUGHOUT THE DAY AN ALSO HELPS YOUR SLEEP AT NIGHT BUT TO DAY ORE TOG ABOUT DOPAMING SO YES BELIEVE ARE NOT THAT MORNING SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE DOES INCREASE YOU'RE LEVELS OF DOOMI NOT JUST CARTISAL AND FOURTH ON THE LESS IS GOING TO BE MOVEMENT EXERCISE OF VARYING KINDS BE RESISTANCE TRAINING CON BE CARTYOVASCLAR TRAINING THAT DOES INCREASE LEVELS OF DOPOMINE HERE WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT ACHIEVING PEAKS IN DOPOMINE I THAT COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH SETTING A PERSONAL RECORD A P R OR THROUGH SPRINTS OR HEAVY LIFTS OR LEARNING SOME NEW DYNAMIC MOVEMENT WHAT REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE IS GETTING INTO A REGULAR EXERCISE PROGRAM OF IF NOT EVERY DAY AT LEAST FIVE DAYS A WEEK A MIXTURE OF CARTY OVASCULAR AN RESISTANCE EXERCISE THAT WE ALSO KNOW IS KNOWN TO ELEVATE AND MAINTAIN AN ELEVATED LEVEL OF BASE LINE DOPOMINE SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE EUPORIA YOU FEEL JURING OR AFTER EXERCISE IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE BASELINE LEVEL OF DOPOMINE THAT'S ACHIEVE THROUGH REGULAR MOVEMENT AND ENGAGING IN MOVEMENT AND IF YOU'RE ASKING HOW COULD THAT BE WILL YOU ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER THE CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT GENERATE MOVEMENT NOT JUST GOAL SEEKING BUT MOVEMENT ITSELF AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT NIGROSTRIATAL PATHWAY AND YES THAT CIRCUIT IS SEPARATE FROM THE V TIER NEUCLYS ACOMMENS TO CORTICAL CIRCUIT TH MEAS A CORTICAL CIRCUIT THAT WE MAINLY BEEN FOCUSSING ON TO DAY BUT THEY INTERRACT AND SO BY ENGAGING IN REGULAR MOVEMENT YOU INSURE THAT YOU'RE MAINTAINING ELEVATED LEVELS OF BASE LINE DOPOMINE WHICH IS WHAT YOU WANT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN ANY KIND OF MOTIVATED PURSUIT BEHAVIOUR OF ANY KIND SO THOSE ARE THE FUNDAMENTALS THAT WILL SET THE LEVEL OF BASE LINE DOPOMINE IN YOUR SYSTEM A COUPLE OF KEY POINTS YES THERE IS VARIATION BASED ON BOTH GENETICS AND CIRCUMSTANCE IN BASELINE LEVELS OF DOPOMINE SOME ONE' GOING THROUGH A PARTICULAR HARD TIME OR IF SOMEBODY INHERITED A GENE IN THE DOPOMINE SYNTHESIS PATHWAY THAT SIMPLY AFFORDS THEM HIGHER LEVELS OF BASELINE DOPOMIN WE LIKELY KNOW THESE PEOPLE THEY SEEM HIGH PROMOTIVATED ALL THE TIME NOT JUST BASED ON PRIOR SUCCESS BUT THEY JUST SEM TOHAVE A LOT OF ENERGY IN A LOT OF GO DRIVE YOUKNOW YOU TOLG ABOUT ACTIVATION ENERGY SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW WHAT THAT TER MEANS OTHERS IF YOU WON'T HAVING LOW ACTIVATION ENERGY IS GREAT AMENG THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT IT TAKES TO GETT INGTO ACTION TO PURSUE ADAPTIVE IN MEANING FUL HEALTHY GOAL SOME PEOPLE JUST SEEM TO HAVE LOWER ACTIVATION ENERGY AND HIGHER LEVELS OF DOPAMNE ARE PROBABLY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SOME OF US HAVE LOWER LEVELS OF BASELINE DOPOMINE REGARDLESS EVERYONE NEEDS TO ENGAGE IN THE FOUNDATIONAL THINGS THAT I JUST MENTION A FEW MOMENTS AGO EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS OR AT LEAST STRIVE TO THERE IS NO ESCAPING THAT NOW THERE ARE THINGS THAT CAN INCREASE ONES BASELINE LEVEL OF DOPAT BEING FURTHER AND SOME OF THOSE GET US INTO THE REALM OF SUPPLEMENTS AND PERSCRIPTION DRUGS BUT FOR NOW I JUST WANT TO MENTION A FEW OF THEM THAT ARE PURELY BEHAVIORAL IN NATURE AR ZERO COST AND THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN IN THE RESEARCH LITERATURE TO INCREASE BASELINE LEVELS OF DOPOMINE FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF ANY OF YOU ARE OUT THERE LISTENING TO THIS THING ABOUT PEAKS AND TROUGHS AND BASELINES YOU MIGHT BE ASKING WAIT WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BASELINE IN A PEAK REALLY BECAUSE IF FOR INSTANCE YOU GET A BIG PEAK WELL THAT'S A PEAK IN THE BASELINES O HOW DO YOU DISTINGUISH BETWEEN PEAK AND BASELINE AND  WELL THERE'S A TROUGH UNLEST SHEY THAT TROUGH LASTS AN HOUR IS THAT HOUR LONG TROUF YOUR BASELINE OR YOU KNOW WEARE'S YOUR SET POINT HOW  HOW DO YOU ESTABLISH YOUR SETPORN AND MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW TO YOU RAISE YOUR SET POINT AH WELL IF YOU'RE NOT ALREADY ASKING THAT QUESTION I JUST ASKED IT FOR YOU I DEFINE AN INCREASE IN YOUR BASELINE LEVEL IN DOPOMINE TO BE ANYTHING THAT INCREASES DOPAMINE FOR MORE THAN ONE HOUR NOW WHEN WE THINK ABOUT COKENE AND FEDAMINE PORONOGRAPHY A SAC CAFINE THINGS OF THAT SORT REGARDLESS OF HOW LONG ONE EN GAGES IN A BOUT OF THOSE BEHAVIORS OR SUBSTANCES THE INCREASES IN DOPAMINE ARE GOING TO BE RELATIVELY SHORT LIVED ON THE ORDER OF MINUTES TO AN HOUR SOMETIMES LONGER I DIDN'T SAY THAT'S HOW LONG YOURE ENGAGING IN THE BEHAVIORS I SAID THAT'S HOW LONG THOSE INCREASES IN DOPAMINE ARE GOING TO OCCUR EVEN IF YOU WERE TO CONTINUALLY ENGAGE IN THOSE BEHAVIORS IND REMEMBER WE CONTINUAL ENGAGEMENT IN A DOPAMINE SPIKING BEHAVIOR BEHAVER THAT INCREASES DOPAOMINE PEAKS THE HIGHT OF THOSE PEAKS REMEMBER GETS LOWER AND LOWER AND LOWER ESPECIALLY IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME AND THEN DROPS BELOW BASELINE THERE ARE TOOLS AND TECHNICS THAT YOU CAN USE TO ELEVATE YOUR BASELINE LEVEL OF DOPAMINE FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND HERE AGAIN THIS IS DONE IN ADDITION TO THE BASIC TOOLS THAT I MENTION A FEW MOMENTS AGO THE SIMPLEST ONE FOR WHICH THERE ARE EXCELLENT DATA AND HERE I'M REFRRING TO DATA PUBLISHED IN THE EUROPEAN JOURNAL PHYSIOLOGY I'LL PROVIDE A LINK TO THIS IS THAT EXPOSURE OF YOUR BODY UP TO THE NECK TO COLD WATER AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SUPER COLD BY THE WAY TO COLD WATER HAS BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE BASELINE LEVELS OF DOPAMINE AND THE OTHER SO CALL CATACOLAMINES WHICH INCLUDE NOR UP AN EFFERN AND EPIN EFFORN BUT FOR SAKE OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION DOPAMINE AN PARTICULAR FOR NOT JUST ONE BUT AT LEAST TO AND PROBABLY AS LONG AS FOUR OR FIVE HOURS THERE BEEN SOME ADDITIONAL SCIENTIFIC STUDIES AFTER THE PAPER I JUST MENTIONED AND IT'S REALLY REMARKABLE YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH US THA NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS YOU COULD GET INTO A COLD SHOWR IN THE MORNING AND I DO RECOMMEND DOING THIS IN THE MORNING AND IN THAT CASE IT'S LOCATE TO GET THE WATER ON YOUR HEAD AM IN FACT I RECOMMEND IT A YOU COULD GET INTO AN ICE PATH YOU COULD GET INTO A COLD PLUNGE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES A'M NOT SUGGESTING THIS FOR SAKE OF INCREASING METABOLISM OR FAT LOSS AND THEWHOLE DISCUSSION AROUND A DELIBERATE COLD AND METABOLISM AND FAT LOSS AS BECOME A LOBIT CONTROVERSIAL THAT WE WON'T GO THERE NOW MOSTLY BECAUSE WE'RE FOCUSET ON THE CLEAR ABILITY OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURER TO INCREASE DOPOMINE FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME EKA YOU'RE DOPOMING BASELINE THE WAYS TO DO THIS VERY DEPENDING ON THE TEMPERATURE SO FOR INSTANCE THERE ARE DATA POINTING TO THE FACT THAT IF YOU WANT TO GET A LONG LASTING INCREASE IN YOUR BASELINE DOPAMINE YOU COULD TAKE A VERY COLD SHOWER OR CO LD PLUNGE OR ICE BATH FOR A VERY BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY SECONDS TO TWO MINUTES MAYBE THREE MINUTES BUT PROBABLY THIRTY SECONDS TO TWO MINUTES NOW YOU MIGHT ASK WHAT IS VERY COLD HEU'RE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO RECOMMEND ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE ANYONE HAVE A HEART ATTACK WE'RE GOING TO SHOCK OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT IT'S GOING TO VARY BI PERSON DEPENDING ON YOUR LEVEL OF COLD TOLERANT SO WHAT I RECOMMEND IS IF YOU ARE GOING FOR THE SHORT EXPOSURE LONG DOPOMIN RELEASE APPROACH THAT IS THIRTY SECONDS TO TWO MINUTES THAT YOU START WARMER THAN YOU THINK YOU NEED TO AND THEY EASE INTO IT OVER A FEW DAYS BUT WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT RANGES IN TEMPERATURE FROM ANYWHERE FROM ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN DEGREES FARRENHEIGHT TO ABOUT FIFTY FIVE DEGREES FERRENHEIT AGAIN BE CAREFUL APPROACH IT WITH CAUTION AND EASE INTO IT I DO RECOMMEND DOING THIS EARLY IN THE DAY AND I SHOULD MENTION NOT AFTER STRENGTH OR HYPERTROPHY TRAINING BECAUSE WITHIN THE SIX HOURS AFTER STRAINGTH OR HYPERTROPHY TRAINING THIS DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE ESPECIALLY IMERGING UP TO THE NECK CAN SUPPRESS THE STRENGTH AND HYPERTRIPHEADAPTATION THAT THE TRAINING IS DESIN TO ACCOMPLISH SO THAT'S ONE APPROACH THE OTHER APPROACH THAT'S SUPPORTED BY THE LITERATURE TO INCREASE BASE SINE LEVELS OF DOPOMINE FOR VERY LONG PERIETS OF TIME IN FACT THIS IS THE ORIGINAL APPROACH IS TO GET INTO WARMER WATER SO NOT WARM BUT WARMER SO SIXTY DEGREE FARRENHEIGHT WATER UP TO THE NECK AND TO STAY THERE FOR ABOUT FORTY FIVE TO SIXTY MINUTES THE REASON I DON'T THINK MOST PEOPLE WILL DO THAT OR THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD PREFER A SHORTER COLDER EXPOSURE PROTOCAL IS THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE FORTY FIVE TO SIXTY MINUTES EACH MORNING TO GET INTO WATER AND SIT THERE AND N THAT STUDY THEY ASHALLY HAD THEM SITTING IN LONG CHAIRS BASICALLY AN THE SHALLOWIND OF A POOL UP TO THEIR NECK FOR A FULL SIXTY MINUTES AND THEN MEASURING DOPOM YOU RELEASE AND SO FORTH SO THEIRE BUNCH OF DURRNWAYS TO DO THIS I SHOULD EMPHASISE I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO BE SUPERPRECISE ABOUT THE TEMPERATURE AND EVEN THE DURATION WHAT I RECOMMEND IS FIND A TEMPERATURE THAT'S UN COMFORTABLY COLD TO YOU MEANING THAT YOU FEEL AGITATED YOU WANT TO GET OUT BUT THAT YOU'R CONFIDENT YOU CAN SAFELY STAY AND AND AGAIN I CAN'T GIVE A SIMPLE PRESCRIPTIVE TO EVERYBODY BUT THIS IS KNOWN TO INCREASE BASE LINE LEVELS OF DOPOMINE SIGNIFICANTLY IN FACT DOUBLE THEM OR MORE FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME MEANING HOURS UP TO FOUR MAYBEVEN SIX HOURS INTO THE DAY WHICH IS ONE OFTHE REASON IS SUGGEST DOING THIS EARLY IN THE DAY I HAPPEN TO GET INTO A COLD PLUNGER TAKE A COAL CHOWER FIRST THING IN THE MORNING I DO GO OUTSIDE ANGET MY SUNLIGHT FIRST SOMETIMES SOMETIMES I DO THE COLD FIRST IT REALLY DEPENDS ON MY CIRCUMSTANCES AND HOW I'M FEELING THAT DAY I DON' THINK IT REALLY MATTERS WHICH WHEN YOU DO FIRST BUT YOU WANT TO TRY AND GET BOTH OF THOSE IN EARLY IN THE DAY BECAUS YOU REALLY WANT THE CATACOL MEANS AND CUARTERS ALL ELEVATED EARLY IN THE DAY GUESS THAT'S DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE WE ALREADY TALKS ABOUT EXERCISE SO IF YOU'RE DOING YOUR EXERCISE EARLY IN THE DAY THERE'S NO REASON WHY IT COULDN'T BE DONE IN CONCERT WITH THIS DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE I RECOMMEND DOING THE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE FIRST FOR THE REASONS WE TALK ABOUT A FEW MINUTES AGO AND THEN OF COURSE THERE ARE COMPOUNDS BOTH PRESCRIPTION AND OVER THE COUNTER COMPOUNDS THAT CAN INDEED RAISE YOUR BASELINE LEVELS OF DOPOMINE FOR AN HOUR OR MORE AND WHEN I SAY I N HOUR OR MORE IRREALLY DEPENDS ON INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN TERMS OF HOW QUICKLY OU METABOLIZE DOPOMINE AND IT DEPENDS ON INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN HOW YOU MANAGE OR TOLERATE DIFFERENT DOSAGES OF DRUGS IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF DRUGS SO THE TYPICAL DRUGS AND HERE INM TALKING ABOUT LEGAL PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR INCREASING DOPOMINE AR THINGS LIKE RIDDLIN ATERALL MODAPHINAL AND ARMODAPHINAL ALSO TAPINTO THI SYSTEM AND I DIDN'T ENTIRE EPISODE ABOUT EIGTY HTY WHICH IS THE TYPICAL CONTEXT IN WHICH YOU HEAR ABOUT THESE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BUT ASSUMING ITS PRESCRIBED BY A DOCTOR FOR EITHER CLINICAL REASONS LIKE EIGHTY H T OR FOR OTHER REASONS ALL OF THOSE COMPOUNDS DO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE BASELINE LEVELS OF DOPOMINE FOR MANY MANY HOURS THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR AND IT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS WHY THOSE DRUGS ARE SO EFFECTIVE IN INCREASING MOTIVATION AND ATTENTION THEN THEIR COMPOUNDS THAT ARE SOLD OVER THE COUNTOR INGS LIKE A MENOACIDS SUCH AS EL TYROCINE ITSELF THAT'S A VERY COMMONLY SOLD AND USED A MINOACID IT'S PRESENT IN A LOT OF SO CALLED PREWORK OUT FORMULAS I AS MANY OF YOU KNOW AM A FAN OF SINGLE INGREDIENT SUPPLEMENTS FOR THE MOST PART ASIDE FROM FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENTS LIKE AGYONE WHICH GIVE YOU MANY MANY MICRONUTRIANS AND ALL TOGETHER BECAUSEIT WULD BE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CONSUME EACH OF THOSE AS INDIVIDUAL OM INGREDIENTS AND GET THE RIGHT AMOUNTS ET CETERA BUT FOR ALL OTHER SUPPLEMENTS I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN PARSING WHAT YOU NEED IN WHAT'S MOST EFFECTIVE FOR OU IN SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS AND THE TYPICAL WAYS IN WHICH PEOPLE WORK TO ELEVATE THEIR BASELINE LEVELS OF DOPOMINE WITH SUPPLEMENTS ARE USING EITHER ELD TYRICINE WHICH AS I MENTIONED EARLIER AS THE RATE LIMITING ENZIME FOR DOPOMINE OR I USING WHAT'S CALLED MACUNIPURIANS WHICH IS ASHALLY VERY SIMILAR TO ALDOPA WHICH IS THE TREATMENT FOR PARKINSINS MACUNOPURINS ACTUALLY COMES FROM THE VELVETY OUTSIDE CODING OF A CERTAIN BEIN I KNOW SOUNDS REALLY A SOTERIC BUT THAT SICIALLY WHERE IT'S FOUND IN NATURE AND IS REALLY NINETY NINE PER CENT EL DOPA AND I CONFESS HAVING TRIED MACUNIPURIANS HAVING EXAMINED THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATRO MACUNIPURIANS THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT IT CAN INCREASE DOPOMINE ESPECIALLY IN THAT TUPER IN FROM DIBULAR PATHWAY BECAUSE IT CAN TAPIN TO SOME OF THE HORMON RELATED FUNCTIONS OF THE PETUITARY IT DOES INCREASE ALERTNESS AND MOOD IT MIGHT EVEN INCREASE LOBEDO MOTIVATION ET CETERA BUT THE EFFECTS OF MCUNIPERIANCS TEND TO BE VERY MUCH OF THE INCREASING THE PEAKIN DOPOMINE AND THEN VERY QUICKLY DROPPING THAT PEAK IN OTHER WORDS THE PEK TROUGH PHENOMENON NOT FOR INCREASING BASELINE LEVELS OF DOPOMINE IT'S LIKELY DIFFERENT FOR PEOPLE WITH PARKINSINS WHO ARE TAKING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO MACUNIPURIAN SO HEF PEOPLE AT PARKINSONS OFTENTIMES THEY ARE PRESCRIBED THINGS LIKE ELDOPA WHICH IS IN THE PATHWAY TO DOPOMINE SYNTHESIS OR THEY ARE PRESCRIBED THINGS LIKE BROMO CRIPTINE WHICH WILL INDEED INCREASE DOPOMNE DI DO REALIZE THAT SOME PEOPLE USE THOSE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RECREATIONALLY WHICH I DON'T RECOMMEND THOSE DRUGS CAN BE USED TO INCREASE BASE LONE LEVELS OF DOPAMINE BUT MORE TYPICALLY THEY CAUSE PEAKS IN DOPAMINE AND TROUGHS IN DOPAMINE WHICH IS WHY I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM THEY ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO A COMPLISH WHAT YOU WANT IF YOUR GOAL IS MORE MOTIVATION ET CETERA IN FACT THEY ARE LIKELY TO DO THE OPPOSITE GIVE YOU A BIG PIE IN ALERTNESS AND THEN A CRASH THAT CAN INCLUDE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN JUST NOT FEELING VERY GOOD ELL TYRACINE HOWEVER HAS BEEN EXAMINE IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AND AT REASONABLY LOW DOSAGES HAS BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE CIRCULATING AND AVAILABLE LEVELS OF DOPAMINE BOTH IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND LEAD TO INCREASE COGNIVE PERFORMANCE AN IN SOME CASE PHYSICAL OUTPUT I'LL PROVIDE LINKS TO A FEW THESE STUDIES BUT THE TWO THAT A I REALLY PARSED MOST FINELLY FOR SAKE OF THIS EPISODE REALLY JUST FOCUS ON TAKING EL TRACINE UNDER CONDITIONS WHERE YOUR BASELINE LEVELS OF DOPAMINE ARE REDUCED DO TO STRESS AND UNDER CONDITIONS WHERE THERE'S NO STRASS AND PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO INCREASE THEIR BASELONE LEVELS OF DOPAMINE FOR SAKE OF IMPROVING COGNIVE FUNCTION THE FIRST PAPER IS ENTITLED EFFECT OF TYRACINE ON COGNIVE FUNCTION AND BLOOD PRESSURE UNDER STRESK I'LL PROVIDE A LINK TO THIS IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS AND IT'S ONE OF MANY PAPERS REALLY TATING BACK TO THE EARLY NINEIES EXPLORING HOW RELATIVELY HIGH FRANKLY RELATIVELY HIG DOSAGES OF EL TYRISINE TAKE IN UNDER CONDITIONS OF STRESS ALLOW PEOPLE TO RESCUE SOME OF THEIR COGNIVE FUNCTION IN TERMS OF WORKING MEMORY TASKS AND OTHER KIND OF COGNIVE TASK OF VISUAL PURSUIT TASKS AND SO ON THE SECOND PAPERS ENTITLED TYRACINE IMPROVES WORKING MEMORY IN A MULTI TASKING ENVIRONMENT AND THIS SECOND PAPERIS PERHAPS MORE INTERESTING BECAUSE IT INVOLVES EXPLORING THE USE OF TYRCINE SUPPLEMENTATION THEY SELY TAKING TYRCINE ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE A COGNAVE TASK OR SET OF COGNIVE TASK THAN INVOLVE A LOT OF MULTI TASKING AND WORING MEMORY WORKING MEMORY FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T KNOW IS YOUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN SMALL BATCHES OF INFORMATION IN YOUR MIND FOR RELATIVELY SHORT PERIODS OF TIME SO FOR INSTANCE IF I TELL YOU MY PHONE NUMBER ER THE PHONUMBER WHERE I GREW UP FORNINTHRY TO NINTHRY ONE IF YOU CAN REMEMBER THAT CHANCES ARE YOU'LL REMEMBER IT FOR THIRTY SECOND SIXTY SECONDS BUT THA YOU WON'T REMEMBER IT TOMORROW CAUSE IS REALLY NO REASON TO A LOT OF THE TASKS THAT WE DO THROUGHOUT THE DAY INVOLVED WORKING MEMORY IND WORKING MEMORY IS VERY SUBJECT TO INTERFERENCE FROM OTHER TASKS THAT WE HAPPEN TO BE DOING LIKE LOOKING AT OUR PHONE OR HAVING A CONVERSATION ARE TRYING TO NAVIGATE THROUGH A CITY INVOLVES A LOT OF ATTENTION AND THIS STUDY SHOWS THE TYRAINE IMPROVES WORKING MEMORY ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTECTS OF MULTY TASKING AND HAVING A LOT OF CONFLICTING GOALS AND THEY DID A NUMBER REALLY NICE ON EXPERENMENTS HERE IT'S AGAIN IT'S A SMALL STUDY NOT THAT MANY SUBJECTS BUT IT'S ONE OF SEVERAL PAPERS IN FACT THIS IS THE PAPER THAT AND OF SET IN MOTION THAT DOMINO OF OTHER PAPERS EXPLORING THE EFFICACY OF EL TYRACINE FOR COGNAVE PERFORMANCE AND THEY LOOKED AT WORKING MEMORY TASK OF COURSE BUT ALSO AUDITORY VISUAL TASK IN THE INVOLVESOM A INTERFERENCE OF VISUAL CUES AND THINGS OF THAT SORT AND THEY SAW SOME REALLY INTERESTING EFFECTS N BASICALLY WHEN WE NEED TO ATTEND TO MULTIBLE THINGS AT THE SAME TIME EL TIRASINE CAN HELP US DO THAT AT LEAST AS IT RELATES TO MEMORY WHEN I SAY AL TYRASINE WOULD I REALLY MEAN IS HAVING YOUR BASELINE LEVELS OF DOPOMINE ELEVATED CAN REALLY HELP NAVIGATE MULTITASKING ENVIRONMENTS ESPECIALLY AS IT RELAITES TO WORKING MEMORY IN THIS IS TRUE UNDER CONDITIONS OF STRESS AND UNDER CONDITIONS OF NOT STRESSFUL KIN NOW YOU MIGHT SAY WHALL ISN'T MULTITASKING ISTRESS FUL ITSELF YES IT CAN BE BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT UNDER CONDITIONS OF STRESS WERE TOGAMA PEOPLE WHO ARE SLEEP DEPRIVED WERE TOIG ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ARE UNDER OTHER KINDS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL OR PHYSICAL STRESS ELTIRASINE CAN HELP IN THAT CONTACT AS WELL SO AS I MENTION BE FOR IN THESE STUDIES THEY USED VERY HIGH DOSAGES OF EL TIRASINE SO HIGH THAT ASHI DON'T RECOMMEND THEM THEY DID MEASURE STRESS HORMONES THEY DID MEASURE BLOD PRESSURE AND THINGS OF THAT SORT BUT I WANT A CAUTION YOU I DO NOT RECOMMEND I WE'LL SAY TOGAIN I DO NOT RECOMMEND FOLLOWING THE DOAGES THAT WERE USED IN THESE TWO STUDIES BECAUSE THEY ARE EXCEEDINGLY HIGH THEY USED ONE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS PERKILEGRAM OF BODYWEIGHT OF TIRASNE ONE HOUR PRIOR TO THESE COGNAVE TASK NOW I WAY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY POUNDS ON A LITTLE BIT LIGHTER THAN THAT SO THAT'S A HUNDRED KILIGRAMS APPROXIMATELY TRANSLATED FROM THIS STUDY THAT WOULD MEANE THAT HAD I PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY AND I WASN'T IN THE POSIBO GROUP BUT I WAS IN THE A ALTIRASINE GROUP I WOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TEN THOUSAND MILIGRAMS OF EL TIRASINE WHICH IS TEN GRAMS OF ELTIRASINE I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT IN FACT TO THERE ARE PAPERS SHOWING THAT AS LITTLE AS FIVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS BUT PERHAPS UP TO ONE GRAM THAT IS A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS OR FIFTEEN HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF GRAM AND A HALF OF EL TIRASINE TAKE IN THIRTY TO SIXTY MINUTES BEFORE A TOGNAVE OR PHYSICAL TASK CAN INCREASE BASELINE LEVELS OF DOPOBIN FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME AND THEREBY IMPROVE PERFORMANCE ON THOSE MENTAL OR PHYSICAL TASKS SO IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WUSE INTEREST IN TRYING EL TIRISINE PLEASE KNOW THAT THE INCREASES IN BASELINE LEVELS OF DOPOMINE CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL THEY ARE LONG LASTING WHICH QUALIFIES THEM AS BASE SLUNG INCREASES AS POST TO PEAKS AND I WOULD SAY YOU SHOULD ALSO START WITH THE LOWEST POSSIBLE DOSE SO FOR MOST PEOPLE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO FIVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS AS GOING TO BE A REASONABLE STARTING DOSE DEPENDING ON YOUR BODYWEIGHT SMALLER PEOPLE START WITH TWO HUNDRED FIFTY LARGER MAY BE FIVE HUNDRED KEEP IT ON WHETHER NOT YOUR COMBINING IT WITH KAFFINE OR WITH ANY OTHER STIMULANTS AND KEEP IN MIND THAT AGAIN THE BIGGER THE PEAK AN DOPOMINE THE BIGGER THE TROUGHIN DOPOMEAN AFTERWARDS SO PAY ATTENTION TO WHETHER NOT YOU EXPERIENCE A CRASH THAT SAME DAY OR THE NEXT DAY BUT CHANCES ARE IF YOU'RE USING OR RELATIVELY LOW LEVEL OF EL TIRASINE SO ANYWHERE FROM TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MAY BE FIVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OR A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS OF EL TIRASINE PRIR TO COGNAVE OR PHYSICAL WORK AND TAKIN EARLY IN THE DAY BY THE WAY CAUSE THIS CONNACT AS A BIT OF A STIMULAN THEY YOU'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE THESE LONGLASTING INCREASES IN BASELINE DOPOMINE BUT PLEASE ALSO KEEP IN MINE THAT I ALWAYS ALWAYS SUGGEST THAT YOU ENGAGE IN THE PROPER BEHAVIORS AND YOU DISENGAGE FROM THE IMPR OPER BEHAVIORS AS A FIRST LINE OF OFFENSE ON ANY HEALTH GOL SO NOW YOU KNOW HOW TO SET YOUR BASELINE LEVELS OF DOPAMINE AT THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE LEVEL YOU OF COURSE WANT TO GUARD THAT BASELINE LEVEL OF DOPAMINE VERY CAREFULLY SO FOR INSTANCE YOU WANT TO AVOID ANY KIND OF BEHAVIORS OR SUBSTANCES THAT ARE GOING TO PEAK YOUR BASELINE LEVEL OF DOPAMINE VERY HIGH OR VERY SHARPLY OR IF YOU DO ENGAGE IN THOSE TYPES OF BEHAVIORS WHATEVER THEY MAY BE THAT YOU ARE WELL AWARE THAT YOUR BASELINE LEVEL OF DOPAMINE WILL DROP FAR BELOW WHAT IT WAS AFTER THAT PEAK HAS FALLEN YOU WILL BE ESSENTIALLY IN THE QUOTENQUO TROUGH IF HOWEVER YOU FIND YOURSELF IN THAT TROUGH YOU NOW HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT TROUGH WILL RESOLVE IF YOU WAIT ENOUGH TIME THAT BASELINE LEVEL OF DOPAMINE THAT YOU ARE AT PRIOR TO THE PEAK WILL COME BACK YOU WILL FEEL BETTER HOWEVER MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT AND AS A CONSEQUENCE WHEN THEY FEEL THAT LOW THAT IS THEY FEEL KUND OF AMOTIVATED MAYBE  LIL BIT DEPRESSED MAY BE A LOT AMOTIVATED OR A LOT DEPRESSED FOLLOWING SOME QUOTEQUO PEAK EXPERIENCE WHAT THEY END UP DOING IS THINKING ABOUT WHAT CAUSE THAT PEAK EXPERIENCE AND THEN GO BACK AND TRY TO REENGAGE IN THE BEHAVIOR AND TRYING REGENERATE THAT PEAK EXPERIENCE BUT YOU NOW KNOW THAT THAT IS A TERRIBLE STRATEGY IN FACT THAT STRATEGY WILL ONLY LEAD TO DIMINISHED PEAKS FROM THE SAME EXPERIENCE IT WILL LEAD TO IN MANY CASES PURSUING MORE AND MORE INTENSE EXPERIENCES TO TRY AND RECAPITULATE RECREATE THAT BIG PEAK WHICH WON'T WORK OR EVEN WORSE PEOPLE START STACKING AND COMBINING DIFFERENT DOPAMINE INCREASING BEHAVIORS IN ORDER TO TRY AND OBTAIN SOMETHING LIKE THAT INITIAL PEAK WHEN IN FACT ALL THEY NEED TO DO ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS SIMPLY WAIHT BECAUSE THE WAY THAT THE DOPAMINE CIRCUITRY IS ARRANGED IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT PLEASURE AS YOU KNOW IT'S ABOUT MOTIVATION DESIRE PURSUIT AND PLEASURE AND IT ALSO HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH PAIN AND DISCOMFORT NOW WHEN PEOPLE HEAR THE WORD PAIN THEY OFTEN THINK O PAINOCASO A A PHYSICAL PAIN OR A INTENSE EMOTIONAL PAIN BUT TO DAY WORK IN A TALK ABOUT PAIN A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY WERE GIN A TALK ABOUT THE PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROUGH IND DOPAMINE THAT OCCURS AFTER A BIG PEAK AND DOPAMINE AS A PERIOD IN WHICH PAIN AND EFFORT GO HAND IN HAND AND ILL RETURN TO THIS IN A MOMENT BUT I WANT YOU TO JUST NOTE THAT IN YOUR MIND CAN VE EAR MARK THAT IN YOUR MIND BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT IS HOW TO LEVERAGE THAT PAIN AND TO USE EFFORT AS A WAY TO NOT JUST GET OUT OF THE TROUGH MORE QUICKLY BUT ACTUALLY TO GET BACK TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF BASELINE AS YOU EGGS AT THAT TROUGH MEANWHILE I REALLY WANT A HARP ON THIS ONE POINT THAT I MADE A MOMENT AGO WHICH IS THAT AFTER SOME BIG EXPERIENCE SO IT COULD BE A VACATION OR A NIGHT OUT PARTING WERE THE BIRTH OF A NEW TRILD ALL OF THESE ARE WELL KNOWN PHENOMENA THAT LEAD TO TROUGHS OR DEFISITS IN DOPAMINE AFTERW ORDS WHICH CAN CAUSE A SORT OF POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION POSTPART OM DEPRESSION IS A PHRASE NORMALLY USED TO DESCRIBE LITERALLY POSTPARTUM POSTBIRTH OF A CHILD DEPRESSION AND THAT HAS MANY CAUSES NOT JUST RELATED TO DOPAMING BASELINES ALTHOUGH IT DOES INVOLVED OPEMING BASELINES BUT IT HAS HORMONAL ASPECTS AND OTHER ASPECTS AS WELL BUT POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION IS ALSO USED TO DESCRIBE ANY TIME THAT OUR BASELINE DOPAMINE HAS GONE DOWN WAYWAY BELOW WHAT IT WAS PRIOR TO SOME RECENT PEAK OR EXCITING EXHILERATING WIN OR BEHAVIOR COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ONE CAN DO IN ORDER TO GET OUT OF THAT TROUGH MORE QUICKLY THE FIRST ONE IS SIMPLY TO WAIGT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU WILL GET OUT I KNOW THAT SOUNDS OVERLY SIMPLISTIC AND BE A LITBIT BRUTAL BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THIS THEY DON'T REALIZE THAT THE DOPAMING CIRCUITRY DOES TAKE TIME TO REPLENISH AND IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH RESTORING BOTH THE SYNTHESIS OF DOPAMINE AS WELL AS WHAT'S CALLED THE READILY RELEASIBLE POOL OF DOPAMIN SO DOPAMING IS PACKAGE IN THESE LITTLE SPHERICAL THINGS THAT WE CALL VESICALS THOSE VESICLS ARE RELEASED FROM THE ENDS OF NERVES SO ON IN THIS CASE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NERVES THAT ORIGINATE AGAIN IN B T  AND NUCLES ACCUMMONS AND SEND THEIR LOWIRES UP TO THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEC AND THAT'S WHERE DOPAMINE IS RELEASED AND THAT READILY RELEASIBLE POOL OF DOPAMINE TAKES TIME TO REPLENISH AND THAT CAN TAKE SEVERAL DAYS IN ORDER TO REPLENISH JUST KNOWING THAT CAN HELP YOU THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND OF COURSE THEN IT RAISES THE QUESTION IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN DO TO ACCELERATE THAT PROCESS AND INDEED THERE IS AND INDEED THIS IS WHAT I CONSIDER NOT JUST SOMETHING TO GET YOU OUT OF A TRENCH OF AND A LOWER MOOD AN MOTIVATION BUT ACTUALLY WHAT REPRESENTS THE HOLY GRAIL OF MOTIVATION TO DAY IOM ON A TALK ABOUT THIS PAIN EFFORT PROCESS AS A VERY POWERFUL WAY TO GET OUT OF STICKING POINTS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TO GET INTO A MODE WHERE EFFORT AND REWARD CAN ACTUALLY ECCELERATE YOUR PROGRESS ALONG ANY PATH TO ANY GOAL AND IN A WAY THAT YOU CAN DO IT REPEATEDLY AND THIS IS NOT SIMPLY TAKING MECHANISMS FROM BIOLOGY AND PAINTING NAMES ON THEM RATHER THIS IS LEVERAGING MECHANISMS IN BIOLOGY THAT ARE WELL DEFINED IN THE ANIMAL AND HUMAN LITERATURE THAT HAVE PARALLELS TO THE ADDICTION AND ADDICTION RECOVERY LITERATURE BUT THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN IN SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES TO REALLY ALLOW PEOPLE TO ENGAGE IN MOTIVATIONAL PURSUITS IN A VARIETY OF CONTECT SCHOOL RELATIONSHIPS WORK ET CETERA IN AN ON GOING WAY AND IN A WAY THAT NEVER DEPLETES THEIR BASELINE OF DOPAMINE TO THE POINT WHERE THEY HAVE TO DO A LOT OF EXTRA WORK TO GET IT BACK AND IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS THEM TO BE REALLY MOTIVATED IN A VARIETY OF CONTECTS IN AN ADAPTIVE WAYS WHAT WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE IS REGARDLESS OF YOUR GENETICS REGARDLESS OF WHO YOUR PARENTS ARE WHICH OBVIOUSLY YOU COULDN'T CELECT BEING ABLE TO LEVERAGOUR DOPAMINE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO BE MAXIMUMLY MOTIVATED WHEN YOU WANT TO BE AND INDEED TO AVOID PRECRASTINATION I LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT A CLASSIC EXPERIMENT THAT I'VE DESCRIBED ONCE BEFORE ON THIS POD CAST BUT FRANKLY THIS EXPERIMENT IS SO CRUCIAL I DON'T THINK THEY CAN BE DESCRIBED ENOUGH THIS WAS AN EXPERIMENT THAT WAS DONE AT STAMFORD MANY YEARS AGO AND INVOLVED CHILDREN BUT IT'S ACTUALLY BEN REPEATED IN ADULTS THEY EXPEREMENT INVOLVED OBSERVING A CLASS FROM OF YOUNG CHILDREN SO THESE WERE KIDS ABOUT KINDEGARDEN AGE A LITTLE BIT OLDER AND OBSERVING WHICH ACTIVITIES KIDS LIKE TO DO IN THEIR FREE TIME SO THEIR STRUCTURE TIME WHERE THEY HAD TO YOU KNOW THESE LITLE KITS RE THEY PLAY BLOCKS OR THEY HAD TO OM SEEING OR THEY HAD TO WRITE OR THER DO WHAT THEY COULD OR HAVE SUPPOSE DRAW THEIR PROBALY NOT A WRITING A SIGNIFICANT PROSE OF THAT AGE BAT THEN THEY HAVE FREE TIME WHERE THEY COL DO WHATEVER THEY WANTED AND WHA THE RESEARCERS DID WAS OBSERVED THE CHILDREN WHO SELECTED BY THEIR OWN CHOICE TO DRAW PICTURES SO THERE WERE SOME TABLES OUT WITH CRANS AND MARKERS AND PAPER AT CETERA AND THEREWRE SOME KIDS THAT WOULD JUST NATURALLY GO TO THAT ACTIVITY EVERY DAY CAUSE THEY LIKED THAT ACTIVITY AND THEY MEASURED HOW MUCH OF THE FREE TIME THESE CHILDREN ELECTED TO USE THEIR FREE TIME DRAWING DOING THESE DIFFERENT ART PROJECTS AND THEN WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY STARTED INTRODUCING REWARDS TO TESE CHILDREN THEY STARTED PUTTING A GOLD STAR ORE IN SOME CASES A SILVER STAR ON THEIR PIECES OF ORT WORK AND TELLING THEM WHAT A GOOD JOB THEY DID AND THE KIDS REALLY LIKED THAT IN FACT WHO WOULDN'T I THEYRE NOT ONLY DOING IN ACTIVITY THAT THEY LIKE BUT THEYRE ALSO GETTING A REWARD FOR IT SEE CAN PROBABLY SEE WHERE THIS IS ALL GOING WUT THEY WERE DOING WAS THEY WERE INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF DOPOMEN THAT THESE CHILDREN EXPERIENCE AND AGAIN IN PARALLEL EXPERIMENTS DONE WITH ADULTS YOU TAKE ADULTS WHO ENJOY A PARTICULAR ACTIVITY YOU LET THEM DO ACTIVITY AND THEN YOU START REWARDING THEM FOR THAT ACTIVITY ESPECIALY WHEN YOU SURPRISE THEM WITH A REWARD FOR AN ACTIVITY THEY ALREADY LIKE THEY REPORT THAT BEING A MUCH MORE PLEASUREFUL EXPERIENCE THAN HAD THEY JUST ON THE ACTIVITY THEN WHAT THEY DID WITH THESE CHILDREN AND IN THE EXPERIMENTS WITH ADULTS DONE LATER ON WAS THEY CEASE GIVING THEM THE REWARD AND THEN THEY OBSERVED WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THEIR FREE TIME THEY SPEND DOING THAT ACTIVITY DRAWING AND WHAT THEY OBSERVED WAS YOU GUESSED IT A DROP IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THE CHILDREN ELECTED TO DO THIS ACTIVITY THAT INITIONALLY THEY WERE DOING QUITE A LOT IN OTHER WORDS THEIRE TOTAL SATISFACTION OR DESIRE OR MOTIVATION TO ENGAGE IN THIS ACTIVITY DROP BELOW WHAT IT WAS PRIOR TO EVER RECEIVING A REWARD AND AGAIN THIS HAS BEEN REPEATED IN A VARIETY OF CONTACTS AND DIFFERENT POPULATIONS DIFFERENT CULTURES DIFFERENT COUNTRIES MEN WOMEN BOYS GIRLS LOTS OF DIFFEREN BACKGROUNDS TO WHAT THIS TELLS US IS EVERYTHING YOU ALREADY KNOW WHICH IS THAT REWARD PREDICTION ERROR IS NOT JUST ABOUT THEY DESIRE TO DO SOMETHING AND YOU CARRYING IT OUT AND IT BEING PRETTY GOOD AMAZING OR NOT GOOD A I ALWAYS LIKE TO JOKE THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM SORT OF CODES THINGS INTO THREE BINS OMYO CAN THINK ABOUT THE SINTERMS OF FOOD OR ANY TYPE OF EXPERIENCE IT CAN EITHER BE YUM YES I REALLY LIKE THAT YOCK I REALY DON'T LIKE THAT OR ME AS KINT OF SO SO WHAT THE SENAREO LED TO WHERE REWARDS WERE RECEIVED FOR AN ACTIVITY THAT PEOPLE ALREAD LIKE TO DO AND THEN REMOVED WAS THAT AN ACTIVITY THAT AT ONE POINT WAS A YUM BECOMES E MECH AND THAT ALL REFLECTS A DROP AND BASE LINE DOAMINE WHY BECAUSE THE ACTIVITY THAT THE CHILDREN OR ADULTS LIKE COMBINE WITH THE GOLD STAR OR THE MONITORY REWARD OR PRAISE THAT CHILDREN AN ADULTS SEEM TO LIKE COMPOUNDED TO CREATE A BIGGER PEK AND DOPAMINE AND THEREFORE A BIGGER TROUGH IN DOPAMINE AND IF YOU'RE ALREADY WONDERING WHETHER NOT THEIR DESIRE TO ENGAGE IN THAT ACTIVITY EVENTUALLY CAME BACK IT DID INDEED SO ESPENCILLY WHAT I DESCRIBED ALL MATCHES PRECISELY WITH DOPAMEN REWARD PREDICTION ERROR AND THE FACT THAT PEAKS AND DOPAMIE GIVE RISE TO SUBSEQUENT TROUGHS AND DOPAMIN THAT IF ONE WAITS LONG ENOUGH ALLOW BASE LONE LEVELS OF DOPAMINE TO RETURN TO NORMAL AND OF COURSE THE AMPLITUDE OF THAT DOPAMINE PEAKE HAS BEEN VARIED BY GIVING MORE MONEY OR LESS MONEY AND DIFFERENT SCYNAREOS NEARLY ALL THE DIFFERENT DERRIVATIONS OF THE EXPERIMENTS THAT YOU COUL IMAGION THAT MAP ON TO THE DYNAMICS OF DOPAMINE RELEASE THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DURING THIS EPISODE ALL PLAYED OUT EXACTLY AS ONE WOULD HAVE PREDICTED BASED ON THE NARRL CIRCUITRY AND THE DYNAMICS OF DOPAMINE I RECOMMEND THAT YOU LEVERAGE THIS KNOWLEDGE TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY ACTIVITIES THAT YOU ENJOY TO DO WHETHER OR NOT YOU ENJOY IT A LITTLE OR A LOT BUT ESPECIALLY IF YOU ENJOY IT A LOT THAT YOU GUARD AND PROTECT BY MAKING SURE THAT YOU DON'T START LAYERING IN OR ATTACHING REWARD OR OTHER SOURCES OF DOPAMIN RELEASING BEHAVIORS OR SUBSTANCES TO THAT SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR OR IF YOU DO THAT YOU DON'T DO IT TERRIBLY OFTEN NOW HOW OFTEN IS TERRIBLY OFTEN WILL GET TO THAT IN A MOMENT BUT LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE FROM MY LIFE JUST AS AN EXAMPLE BUT YOU WILL LIKELY HAVE AND YOU'LL KNOW PEOPLE THAT WILL HAVE DIFFERENT EXAMPLES I LOVE TO EXERCISE I KNOW TO SOME PEOPLE I THIS MIGHT SEEM FOREIGN BUT I LOVE TO EXERCISE I LOVE TO DO RESISTANCE TRAINING I LOVE TO RUN I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT DOESN'T LIKE THE EXPERIENCE OF EXERCISING BUT LIKES THE FEELING AFTERWARDS QUOTON QUOT I HEAR THAT A LOT I I DON'T LINE TO EXERCISE BUT I LOVE THE WAY I FEEL AFTERWARDS I LOVE PHYSICAL TRAINING AND I LOVE THE WAY I FEEL AFTERWARDS BUT I MOSTLY LOVE THE FEELING JURING I DO'T NOW WHY IA'M WIRE THAT WAY I CAN'T SAY THAT I'M SOMEBODY WHO LIKES TO DO HARD THINGS ACROSS THE BOARD THEIRE PLENTY OF DIFFICULT THINGS IN LIFE THAT I DREAD OR THAT I'M SORT OF MEH ABOUT BUT FOR ME HARD EXERCISE INTENSE EXERCISE OF A PARTICULAR KIND RESISTANCE TRAINING AND RUNNING IN PARTICULAR BOTH GIVE ME A YUM YES I LOVE THIS KIND OF FEELING AND YES IT PERSISTS FOR ME QUITE ALONG WHILE AFTERWARDS BOTH FORSAKE OF THE WAY THAT IT CHANGES MY NARROW CHEMISTRY BUT ALSO MY SENSE OF SATISFACTION BUT I JUST SIMPLY LOVE IT NOW YEARS AGO I DISCOVER THAT IF I DRINK A CUP OF BLACK COFFEE OR AN AMERICANO OR DOUBLE ESPRESSO OR SOME YERBAMATE THAT MY WORK OUTS CAN BE QUITE A BIT MORE INTENSE I CAN RUN FURTH ER AND THEN I ALSO DISCOVERED THAT IF I WERE TO TAKE A PREWORK OUT ENERGY DRINK OR I TOOK SAY THREE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF ALPHAG P C AND FIVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF FENALETHELAMING AND PERHAPS EVEN FIVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF ELTIRASINE AND PERHAPS DID THAT ALONGSIDE THE CAFINE IN THE ERBOMATE THEN YES ABSOLUTELY I REALLY LIKE THOSE WORK OUTS I COULD BEAT LIKE A LAZER IN TERMS OF FOCUS I COULD EXERT EVEN MORE EFFORT PUT ON SOME MUSIC AND I COULD ACHIEVE INVEN BETTER PERFORMANCE AND THEN I ALSO DISCOVERED THAT I COULD EXPORT THAT PROTO CALL OF CAFING YEURBAMATE AND VERY SUPPLEMENTS TO MY COGNITIVE WORK SO AS WHEN I WAS STUDYING OR WITING PAPERS ARE WRITING GRANTS OR IN THE LABORATORY WHEN I WAS DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH MY HANDS IN THOSE DAYS WE KNOW CUTTING BRAIN TISSUE IN STAINING IT AND WORKING REALLY LONG HOURS AND I DISCOVERED THAT ALL OF THOSE THINGS ALL OF THOSE BEHAVIORS COMPOUNDED WITH MY LOVE OF EXERCISE AND MY LOVE OF DOING SCIENCE AND GAVE ME THESE BIG PEAKS IN WHAT TO ME FELT LIKE EVEN IMPORTANT EXPERIENCES THEY FELT THAT YOU KNOW UNLIKE ANYTHING ELSE THEY WERE JUST SO SO PAKE IN THEIR NATURE WHICH WAS GREAT AND IT DID INDEED ENHANCE MY PERFORMANCE HOWEVER WHILE IT DID NOT CREATED DEPENDENCY FOR THOSE DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES CAFFINE SUPPLEMENTS ET CETERA WHAT I NOTICED WAS THAT IN THE DAYS AND SOMETIMES WEAK ENDS AFTERWARDS EVEN THOUGH FOR MUCH OF MY CAREER I CONFESS I'VE WORKED WEAKENDS AS WELL BUT I WOULD NOTICE THAT I'D EXPERIENCE AE REAL TROFTEN ENERGY I JUST WOULD NOT FEEL THAT GOOD AND THEN IF I KEPT UP THOSE BEHAVIORS CONSISTENTLY AND I WAS CONSISTENTLY ADDING IN THESE OTHER LETS JUST CALL THEM WHAT THEY ARE DOPOMINE RELEASING OR STIMULATING BEHAVIORS AND SUBSTANCES THAT MY ENTHUSIASM FOR PHYSICAL TRAINING OR RUNNING OR FOR DOING EXPERIMENTS ACTUALLY STARTED TO DIMINISH AND THIS WAS REALLY DISCOURGING TO ME AT THE TIME BECAUSE I STARTED TO THINK I CAY MAY BE I'M BURNT OUT MAYBE I HAVE A DRENAL BURN OUT WHICH BY THE WAY DOESN'T EXIST FOLKS YOUR DREAALS DON'T BURN OU THERE IS SOMETHING ALL TO DRENAL IN SUFFICIENCY CINDRUM YOU CAN OVER STIMULATE YOUR SYSTEM BY WAY OF TOO MUCH A DRANALIN UP AN EFFRON IND NORUP AN EFFORT BUT THAT'S A SEPARATE THING THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A DRENAL BURN OUT PERSAY BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT SO I THOUGHT CASHAM REALLY BURNT OUT WHEN IN FACT IT'S NOW OBVIOUS TO ME WHAT I WAS DOING I WAS COMBINING TOO MANY DOPOMINE RELEASING OR STIMULATING BEHAVIORS IN SUBSTANCES FOR THINGS THAT I ALREADY ENJOYED DOING IS BEHAVIORS NAMELY EXERCISE AND DOING EXPERIMENTS ANYTHING RELATE TO SCIENCE ACTUALLY SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS NOT TO AVOID TAKING THINGS ARE DOING THINGS THAT AMPLIFY YOU AMOUNT OF DOPAMINE BUT TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT HOW OFTEN ONE DOES THAT AND HOW MANY DIFFERENT DOPAMINE STIMULATING BEHAVIORS OR COMPOUNDS ONE STACKS ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF TAKING THOSE THINGS ARE STACKING THOSE THINGS IN AND AROUND BEHAVIORS THAT YOU ALREADY REALLY ENJOYED DOING I WAS ESSENTIALLY JUST CREATING ANOTHER VERSION OF THE KIDS IN NURSERY SCHOOL OR FIRST GRADE WITH THE GOLD STAR EXPERIMENT I WAS BASILY JUST DOING THE EXACT SAME THING AND WHEN I REALIZE THAT AND I CHANGED MY RELATIONSHIP TO THOSE COMPOUNDS I DIDN'T ELIMINATE THEM ALL TOGOTHER BUT I STARTED REALIZING FOR INSTANCE THAT I DIDN'T NEED TO DOUBLE UP ON YEUR BOMATE AND COFFEE EVERY WORK OUT SOMETIMES I WOULD DO ONE SOMETIMES I'LD DO THE OTHER FRANKLY I ALWAYS DO ONE OR THE OTHER IT'S RARE THAT I EVER DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING WITHOUT SOME CAFFINE FIRST AND I DO MY PHYSICAL TRAINING TYPICALY IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY SE THAT'S FINE DOESN'T INTERFERE WITH MY SLEEP I MIGHT DO HIKE WITHOUT CAFFIN BUT FO'ME IN AWAIT TRAIN OR OM IN A RUN I TEND TO DRINK COFFEE BEFOREHAND OR HAVE YEUR BOMATE OR IF I OCCASIONALLY MEANING ABOUT ONCE EVERY THIRD SOMETIMES EVERY OTHER BUT USUALLY ABOUT EVERY THIRD WORK OUT I'LL TAKE THREE HUNDRED MELEGRAMS OF ALPHAG P C MAYBE OCCASIONALLY MAYB EVERY THIRD OR FORTH WORK OUT AND THESE ARE RESISTANCE WORK OUTS MIND YOU NOT RUNNING I'LL TAKE FIVE HUNDRED MELIGRAMS OF ALTIRSINE OR MORE TYPICALLY FIVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF FENAL ATHELAMINE AND VERY VERY RARELY MAYBE ONCE EVERY TWO OR THREE MONTHS I MIGHT STACK ALL OF THOSE THINGS TOGETHER PRIOR TO A WORK OUT BUT OF COURSE I'M ALWAYS MINDFUL TO ALSO INCLUDE WORK OUTS OR RUNS OR BOUTS OF COGNATIVE WORK SO THAT COULD BE GRANT WRITING PREPPING FOR POD CAS ET CETERA WHERE I DON'T DO ANYTHING PRIOR MAYBE JUST MY KAFFINE BECAUSE I'VE ABASELINE LEVEL OF CAFINE THAT I USE EACH DAY THE FUNCTION LIKE MANY PEOPLE THERE'S A BASELINE LEVEL CAFFINE THAT JUST ALLOWS US TO FUNCTION IF WE'RE PERPETUAL USER OF CAFFINE I TALKED A LOT ABOUT THIS ON THE EPISODE IN CAFFINE BUT THE KEY HERE IS BE CAUTIOUS I WOULD SAY BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT STACKING AND LAYERING IN TOO MANY DOPAMINE PEAK INDUCING BEHAVIORS ALL AT ONCE ON A REGULAR BASIS THE KEY POINT HERE IS IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY THAT CAN ENGAGE IN THESE INTRINSICALLY JOYFUL ACTIVITIES FOR YOU THESE ACTIVITIESE THAT YOU'RE REALLY MOTE OF AIDE TO DO WHETHER NOT IT SKENG OR PLAYING MUSIC OR DANCING ET CETERA WITHOUT THE NEED TO LAYER IN ADDITIONAL DOPOMINE RELEASING MECHANISMS OR COMPOUNDS OR ACTIVITIES WELL THEN I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU DO THAT BECAUSE THEN YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY MAKING YOURSELF ONE OF THOSE FORTUNATE FEW THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL STIMULLY AND THEREFORE CAN HOLD ON TO THAT PLEASURE CAN HOLD ON TO THAT INTRINSIC PLEASURE IN MOTIVATION TO ENGAGE IN THESE BEHAVIORS OVORK TIME WHICH FRANKLY THERE IS NO REPLACEMENT FOR THERE IS NO PILL OR BOTTLE OR POTION OR MOIVATIONAL SPEECH OR PODCAST OR BOOK THAT CAN REPLACE INTRINSIC MOTIVATION INTRINSIC MOTIVATION IS PERHAPS THE HOLY GRAIL OF ALL HUMAN ENDEAVORS AND BEHAVIORS BECAUSE IT ENCOMPASSES SO MUCH OF WHAT BROUGHT US TO THIS POINT IN OUR SPECIES EVOLUTION AND ALSO WHAT BRINGS EACH IN EVERY ONE OF US CLOSER IND CLOSER TO OUR GOALS AND IF IT'S HAPPENING WITH ENJOYMENT WITHOUT THE NEED TO LAY ER IN ADDITIONAL TOOLS WELL THEN YOU HAVE REALLY TAPPED IN TO THE SOURCE AND WHEN I SAY THE SOURCE I DON'T MEAN IN AND ANY KIND OF MISTICAL WAY I THINK IT'S QUITE CLEAR BY NOW THAT WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT CHEE FROM EASTERN MEDICINE OR WE TALK ABOUT MOTIVATION DRIVE IN PURSUIT IN ON WESTERN NERBIOLOGICAL LANGUAGES THAT RELATES TO DOPAMINE OR WE HEAREABOUT THE SOURCE MAY BE IN MY POCUST EPISODE WITH ON THE ONE AND ONLY RICRUBEN INCREDIBLY PRODUCTIVE MUSIC PROCIR WHOSE AS AN JUST AN UNBELIEVABLE TRACK RECORD IN TERMS OF CREATIVE ENDEAVORS ND HE TALKS ABOUT THE SOURCE WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING WHICH IS THIS SET OF CIRCUITS WITHIN US THAT ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY WHAT WE WANT AND THEN LEAN INTO EFFORT AND THEN TO DO THAT IN A PERSISTENT WAY THAT ALLOWS US TO REACH OUR GOALS AND IF WE CAN DO THAT WITH AN INTRINSIC SENSE OF PLEASURE WILL THAT IS NOTHING SHORT OF MAGIC BUT OF COURSE IT'S NOT MAGIC ITS SCIENCE AND OF COURSE MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT CONCERNED ABOUT TRYING TO PROTECT THE THINGS THEY ALREADY ENJOY IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO DO THOSE THINGS AND ENJOY THEM MOST PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT HOW THEY CAN ENGAGE AND PURSUE THINGS THAT ARE LESS THAN PLEASUREFUL TO THEM OR HOW THEY CAN CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN MOTIVATED BEHAVIORS WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH OR AND THIS IS A BIG ONE I HEAR THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN AS A REQUEST TO COVER ON THIS PODCAST HOW PEOPLE CAN OVERCOME PROCRASTINATION WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT NOW IS HOW THE DYNAMICS OF DOPAMIN RELEASE THAT YOU ALREADY ARE AWARE OF PLUS AN ADDITIONAL DYNAMIC THAT WE HAVEN'T QUITE TALKED ABOUT CAN ALLOW YOU TO LEVERAGE DOPAMINE IN A WAY THAT REALLY WILL BRING YOU TO THE HOLY GRAIL OF MOTIVATION AND DRIVE WHICH IS WHEN EFFORT STARTS TO BECOME THE REWARD ITSELF IN OTHER WORDS WHEN FRICTION BECOMES THE REWARD I KNOW THAT SOUNDS CRAZY TO SOME OF YOU BUT WHEN FRICTION BECOMES THE REWARD YOU CAN PASS FROM AN IDEA AND A GOAL NO MATTER HOW DAUNTING TO SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THAT GOAL WHILE EXPERIENCING WHAT ESSENTIALLY WILL FEEL LIKE PLEASURE THE ENTIRE TIME NOW THAT DOESNIT MEAN IT WILL BE BLISS THE ENTIRE TIME BUT WHAT IS VERY POSSIBLE IS TO LEVERAGE THE DYNAMICS OF BOTH DOPAMING PEAKS AND DOPAMINE TROUGHS IN ORDER TO NOT JUST MAINTAIN YOUR BASELINE LEVEL OF DOPAMINE BUT TO ALSO PULL YOURSELF OUT OF ANY KIND OF PROCRASTINATION WERE OTHER KIND OF OVERTHINKING TRENCHES VERY QUICKLY AND GET BACK INTO A MODE OF PURSUIT SO HOW DO WE MAKE EFFORT THE REWARD YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF SO CALL GROWTH MINE SET GROWTH MINE SET IS THE INCREDIBLE DISCOVERY AND RESEARCH PAPERSE FROM MY COLLEAGUE DOCTOR CAROLL DWECK IN THE PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT AT STAMFORD AND THERE ARE OTHERS SUCH AS DAVID YAGER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AUSTON WHO HAVE LEVERAGE THE SO CALLED GROWTH MINE SET AS A TOOL THAT YOUNG PEOPLE AND ADULTS ALIKE CAN USE IN ORDER TO GET BETTER AT ANYTHING AND THE BASIC CONTOUR OF GROWTH MIN SET IS TO ADOPT THE MINE SET THAT IF YOU CAN'T DO SOMETHING OR IF YOU CAN'T DO IT WELL THAT YOU CAN'T DO IT OR CAN'T DO IT WELL YET 'S THAT WERD YET THAT'S REALLY KEY AND THERE ARE UMBER DIFFERENT TOOLS IN TECHNIQUES THAT PEOPLE USED TO ADOPT GROWTH MIND SET BUT IT'S ALL STARTS WITH THAT RELATIONSHIP TO NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT YET NOW THAT ALL SOUMDS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD WHEN YOU TELL YOURSELF BUT WHEN WE ARE IN A PERFORMANCE CONTACT WHEN WE EXPECT OURSELVES TO BE ABLE TO MOTIV AT OR WHEN WE EXPECT OURSELVES TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM AND WE CAN'T THAT OFTEN SETS UP A DOWNWARD SPIRAL OF MOTIVATION BECAUSE WE ARE SO USED TO BEING ATTACHED TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DESIRE MOTIVATION AND OUTCOMES REWARD PREDICTIONERE WE WANT SOMETHING WE WANT THAT A AN CLASS WE WANT TO LEARN HOW TO DANSEWER WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS A PHYSICAL SKILL OF ANOTHER KIND OR LEARN A LANGUAGE OR  GET THE MATE WE DESIRE OR MAKE THE RELATIONSHIP WORK OR MAKE THE BUSINESS WORK ON AND ON AND THEN WE GET THE OUTCOME THAT WE DON'T WANT AND OUR CONFIDENCE FOR LACK OF A BETTERWARD DROPS OVER TIME OFTENTIMES THAT LEADS TO SITUATIONS WHERE WE ARE NOT MOTIV ITED WE ARE A MOTIVATED IT CAN EVEN LEAD TO SITUATIONS WHERE WE ARE DOWNRIGHT DEPRESSED THERE'S ALSO CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE MYSELF INCLUDED OF COURSE PROCRASTINATE WE KNOW WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING BUT SOMEHOW WE CAN'T GET MOTIV ATED WE KNOW THATF WE PUT IN THE EFFORT WILL GET THERE BUT WE CAN'T DO IT EITHER BECAUSE WE DON'T LIKE THE ACTIVITY OR OR JUST NOT FEELING GREAT NOW WE COULD BE QUOTENCO NOT FEELING GREAT NOT FEELING MOTIVE ATED BECAUSE OURE DOPOMMING BASE LINE IS LOW AND SO I ABSOLUTELY ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THEMSELVES T ANY TIME THERE IN A A MOTIATED STATE TAKE A LOOK AT THE LANDSCAPE OF THEIR LIFE NOT JUST AT THAT MOMENT BUT IN THE PRECEDING DAYS AND WEEKS AND ASK WHETHER R NOT YOU'VE BEEN TENDING TO THOSE FOUNDATIONAL THINGS WE TALK ABOUT EARLIER WHETHEROR NOT YOU ARE I ENGAGING ANY OTHER OF THE TOOLS THA WE TALKED ABOUT EARLY ARE TO SEE IF YOU CAN GET INTO A MOTIVATED STATE HOWEVER IF ALL OF THOSE BOXES ARE CHECKED YOU ANSWER YES I'M DOING ALL THOSE THINGS I'M JUST NOT MOTIVATOR I'M JUST WHATEVER EASO N I JUST PRECRASTANY I I DON'T KNOW I DON'T WANT TO DO ITOR I'M NOT FEELING MOTIVATED WELL THEN THERE'S A VERY POTENT SET OF TOOLS THAT YOU CAN LEVERAGE TO OVERCOME STATES OF LACK OF MOTIVATION OVERCOME PROCRASTINATION AND INDEED CAN HELP YOU DEAL WITH THINGS LIKE OVERTHINKING AS IT RELATES TO PROCRASTINATION AND LACK OF MOTIVATION AS WELL SO THE WAY THIS WORKS IS THE FOLLOWING IF YOU RECALL A PIKE IN DOPOMIN IS FOLLOWED BY A TROUGH IN DOPAME THAT TROUGH AN DOPAMIN IS EXPERIENCED AS PAIN OR WANTING OR CRAVING THAT PAIN THAT I'M REFERRING TO IS ACTUALLY A CRAVING OR A WANTING AND IT'S A CRAVING OR WANTING FOR A SPECIFIC STATE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ACHIEVE THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE THAT YOU'RE IN YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF THAT TROUGH AND AS YOU RECALL FROM EARLIER IN THE EPISODE THAT TROUGH IS THE STIMULUS FOR THE ON GOING RELEASE OF DOPOMI THAT PROVIDES THE PROPELLER THE MOTIVATION TO GO FORWARD AND SEEK SOME GOAL SO WHEN WE ARE NOT MOTIVATED WHEN WE ARE IN A SO CALLED A MOTIVATED STATE OR WHEN WE ARE PRECRASTINATING OR WHEN WE JUST SORT OF CAN'T SEEM TO GET IN GEAR THE KEY TO GETTING OUT OF THAT PAIN TROUGH IS ONE OF TWO THINGS I ALREADY TOLD EARLIER YOU CAN JUST WAIT CAN WAIT TILL YOUR MOTIVATION COMES BACK AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DO WAIT IN FACT THEY PRECRASTINATE THEY START DOING OTHER THINGS THAT ARE LESS PAINFUL THEN THE STATE THAT THEY HAPPEN TO BEGIN WHEN THEY ARE IN A TRYING TO GET INTO GEAR TO GO WORK OUT S HIY REALIZE NOT EVERYONE WANTS TO DO THAT OR TO STUDY OR TO HAVE A HARD CONVERSATIONS WHATEVER IT IS AND WHAT ARE THEY DO THEY START ENGAGING IN ACTIVITIES THAT WE AND INDEED THEY WOULD NOT CONSIDER PLEASUREFUL ACTIVITIES THEY START FOR INSTANCE CLEANING THE HOUSE SO SEEMINGLY OUT OF NOWHERE THEY START ENGAGING IN THESE ACTIVITIES THAT NORMALLY ARE NOT INTRINSICALLY PLEASUREFUL FOR THEM THEY'RE NOT HIGHLY MOTIVADE TO DO THEM AS A REPLACEMENT FOR DOING THE VERY THING THAT THEY QUOTIQOT NEED TO DO OR OUGHT TO DO AND THAT THEIR PROCRASTINATING TO DO BUT THEY'RE SENTIALLY DOING HERE IS A MILD TYPE OF A DICTION REPLACEMENT IN OTHER WORDS RATHER THAN BE IN THE PAINFUL STATE AND WAIT FOR IT TO PASS  DOING THINGS THAT GIVE THEM SOME SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT OSTENSIBLY TO GIVE THEM THE SENSE THAT THEIR COMPLETING THINGS AND PERHAPS IND I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE I'M NOT AM IN THE PSYCHOLOGY OF KNOWING WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE THINKING PERHAPS IN ORDER TO GENERATE THE MOMENTUM IN ORDER TO GET ENGAGED ENOUGH FOR MOTIVATED ENOUGH TO STUDY OR WORK OUT OR WHATEVER ACTIVITY T IS THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO AVOID THROUGH PRECASTINATION NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS DYNAMIC IS FIRST OF ALL IT'S EXTREMELY COMMON AND SECOND OF ALL A LOT OF PEOPLE WE USE THIS AS A TACTIC SO THAT THEY GET VERY CLOSE TO THE DEAD LINE TO COMPLETE SOMETHING AND THEN THEY GO INTO A SORT OF PSEUDO PANIC AND THEN USE ANXIETY AS A WAY TO LEVERAGE THEIR MENTAL AN PHYSICAL RESOURCES TO COMPLETE THAT THING HOW DO I KNOW THE CONTOUR OF THE SO WELL HOW DO I UNDERSTAND THE INNER DYNAMICS OF IT WHELL PART THAT RELATES TO MY WORK IS AN AUROBIOLOGISTS AND READING THE PAPERS THAT I'LL MENTION TOYOU IN A MOMENT BUT IT ALSO RELATES TO THE FACT THAT I'M SOMEBODY WHOWAITS QUITE A WHILE RIGHT UP UNTIL THE LASS MINUTE POSSIBLE TO COMPLETE SOMETHING FOR ACTIVITIES THAT I DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING I'VE BEEN WORKING ON MY WHOLE LIFE IN ANY CASE I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCASTINATION PROCESS SO HOW CAN WE OVERCOME PROCRASTINATIONWIELL IT TURNS OUT THAT THEYRE FINDINGS FROM WITHIN THE EDICTION LITERATURE THAT TURN OUT TO BE VERY POWERFUL TOWARDS LEVERAGING OUR WAY OUT OF PROCASTINATION AND IT HAS TO DO WITH THIS YOU ALREADY KNOW BECAUSE I'VE TOLD YOU PROBABLY DOZEN TIMES NOW THAT THE DEPTH OF THE TROUGH AFTER A DOPEMING PEAK IS PROPORTIONAL TO HOW HIGH THAT PEAK WAS AND HOW STEEP IT WAS HOW QUICKLY THAT PEAK OCCURRED IT TURNS OUT THAT NOT ONLY IS THE DEPTH OF THE TROUGH PROPORTIONAL TO THAT BUT THE RATE AT WHICH YOU GET OUT OF THAT TROUGH IS PROPORTIONAL TO HOW STEEP THAT TROUGH IS LET ME EXPLAIN THIS FOR YOU IN AS CLEAR TERMS AS I POSSIBLY CAN IMAGINE YOU'RE IN AN AMOTIV ATED STATE YOU'RE JUST NOT FEELING MOTIV IT YOU'RE PRECRASTINATING YOU MAY THINK OK THE THING TO DO HERE IS SOMETHING I'LL CLEAN THE HOUSE I'LL TAKE CARE SOME BILLS I'LL DO SOMETHING OR I'LL JUST WAIT THOSE APPROACHES AS WE TALK ABOUT BEFORE GENERALLY DON'T WORK OR AT LEAST DON'T WORK QUICKLY OR THEY LEAD YOU RIGHT UP TO THE DEAD LINE AND THAT'S THE DEAD LINE THAT FORCES YOU TO GET SOMETHING DONE OR YOU JUST DON'T GET IT DONE AND YOU DON'T SUCCEED IN YOUR GOAL THAT HAPPENS A LOT AS WELL HOWEVER IF YOU WERE TO TAKE THAT STATE OF BEING UNMOTIVATED A PRECRASTINATING AN ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING THAT'S HARDER THAN BEING IN THAT AMOTIVATED STATE IN OTHER WORDS DOING SOMETHING THAT'S MORE EFFORTFUL EVEN PAINFUL YOU CAN REBOUND YOURSELF OUT OF THAT DOPAMEAN TROUGH MUCH MORE QUICKLY SO WHAT DO I MEAN YOU WANT TO PUT YOURSELF IN A STATE THAT'S WORSE THAN OR HARDER THAN THE STATE THAT YOU'RE IN OR DO SOMETHING CONOQUOT MORE PAINFUL AND HERE I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR I'LL SAY THIS THREE TIMES BUT I MUST SAY IT FOR THE FIRST TIME NOW WHEN I SAYS MORE PAINFUL I DO NOT MEAN DOING ANY KIND OF TISSUE DAMAGING OR PSYCHOLOGICALLY DAMAGING BEHAVIOUR OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT THAT'S GOING TO RENDER YOU INJURED OR NOT WELL EVEN IN THE SHORT TERN THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M REFERRING TO AS JUST GET THAT ONE OUT OF THE WAY WHAT I'M REFERRING TO IS THE FACT THAT FOR INSTANCE IF YOU'RE FEELING A MOTIV ATED BUT YOU FIND YOURSELF CLEANING THE HOUSE AS A WAY TO PROCRASTINATE YOU COUN SAY WILL CLEANING THE HOUSE IS HARDER THAN SITTING DOWN AND DOING NOTHING BUT ACTUALLY IN THAT MOMENT OR IN THOSE MOMENTS THAT'S NOT THE CASE OR ELSE YOU WOULDN'T BE DOING IT THE REALITY IS THAT THE DOPA MEAN SYSTEM WORKS ACCORDING TO WHAT FEELS HARD OR EASY IN THE MOMENT IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU'RE FEELING A MOTIVATED YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING AND PUT YOURSELF INTO A STATE THAT'S HARDER THAN THE STATE YOU'RE IN SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU'RE SITTIG AROUND FEELING A MOTIV AITOR YOU FIND YOURSELF TENDING TO TASK THAT ARE IRRELEVANT TO THE GOAL THAT YOU REALLY SHOULD BE FOCUSSED ON YOU NEED TO PUT YOUR BODY AND MIND INTO A STATE OF DISCOMFORT QUICKLY AND THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO EITHER ENGAGE IN SOME TANGENTIAL ACTIVITY MEANING AN ACTIVITY NOT RELATED TO YOUR GOAL THAT PUTS YOUR BODY INTO A VERY DIFFERENT STATE SO HERE AGAIN I'LL DEFAULT TO THE OBVIOUS ONE WHICH IS SOMETHING LIKE COLD SHOUER OR COLD IMERSION WHICH NOT ONLY INCREASES DOPAMEN LONG TERM OR OVER SEVERAL HOURS RATHER BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE IS EXPERIENCED AS PAIN THAT PAIN CAUSES A REBOUND OUT OF THAT DOPAMN TROUGH FASTER THAN IT WOULD OCCUR IF YOU HAD JUST STATE IN THAT AMOTI ATED STATE AND WAITED FOR IT TO GO AWAY OR DONE SOMETHING LIKE CLEANING UP THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON FELT LIKE IT REQUIRED LESS FRICTION WHEN I SAY FRICTION I MEAN LIM BIC FRICTION YOUR LIMBIC SYSTEM IS ALWAYS IN THIS DIALOGUE WITH YOUR FOREBRAIN AND LIMBIT FRICTION GOES TWO WAYS LIMBIT FRICTION CAN BE YOU'RE TIRED ING YOU DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING AND SO YOU HAVE TO QUOTINT QUO MOTIV ATE TO DO IT ENERGIZE YOURSELF TO DO IT OR LIMBIC FRICTION CAN BE THAT YOU'RE NERVOUS AND SCARED AND ANXIOUS TO DO SOMETHING AND YOU AFTER CALM YOURSELF IN ORDER TO LEAN FORWARD INTO ACTION IN ORDER TO DO THAT THING DESPITE THE ANXIETY I REALIZE THIS CAN BE A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING AS A CONCEPTS I WANT TO GOING TO A BIT MORE DETAIL LET'S IMAGIN THAT YOU OR SOMEBODY ELSE DOES NOT LIKE TO EXERCISE YOU DON'T WANT EXERCISING YOUR TRYING TO GET YOUR MINIMOM O FIVE DAYS FOR WEAK EXERCISE AND YOU'RE JUST NOT MOTIVATED TO DO IT THERE ARE COUPLE DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES TO DOING THIS ASSUMING YOU'VE TAKING CARE OF ALL THE BASELINE STUFF AL THE FOUNDATIONAL STF WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER AND YOU'RE JUST NOT GETTING IN GEAR AND YOU FIND YOURSELF YOU'N CHECKING YOUR FONE OR MAY BE RETENDING TO SOME TASKS OBVIOUSLY THOSE THINGS ARE QUOTIN GO EASIER FOR YOU MEANING THEY CAUSE LESS LIMBIC FRICTION THEN ENGAGING IN EXERCISE THE TYPICAL ADVICE WOULD BE JUST EXERCISE FOR ONE MINUTE O CA JUST GET ONE MEN OF EXERCISE OR FIVE MINUTES AND THEN USE THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THAT ONE OR FIVE MINUTES AS A MILESTONE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO THEN MOVE TO THE NEXT MILESTONE AND INDEED THAT APPROACH CAN WORK AND IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M DESCRIBING HERE WHEN I SAY THAT YOU'RE IN A STATE OF LACK OF MOTIVATION OR PROCRASTINATION OR BOTH AND YOU NEED TO PUT YOURSELF IN TWO A MORE PAINFUL NOT LESS PAINFUL STATE SO WHAT YOU DO IT YOU PUSH UP AGAINST THAT FRICTION AND YOU EXERCISE FOR A SHORT WHILE AND THEN THAT POPS YOU OUT OF THAT TROUGH THAT'S POSSIBLE BUT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE EVEN THAT WON'T BE POSSIBLE BECAUSE THEY JUST CAN'T GET MOTIV ATOR THEY DO THAT ONE MEN OR FIVE MINUTES AN THEIR TILICE OKAM STILL IN THE TROUGH I'M NOT ACTUALLY FEELING THAT GREAT IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IT MAKE SENSE TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S TENGENTIAL TO THE WHOLE PATH THA YOU'R TRYING TO PURSUE THIS GOAL THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PURSUE THAT IS BELIEVE IT ARE NOT MUCH WORSE THAN JUST BEING A MOTIVATED AND WHEN I SAY WORSE I DON'T MEAN PICKING SOME TASK THAT NORMALLY YOU DON'T LIKE TO DO BUT NOW YOU'RE WILLING TO DO I MEAN LITERALLY THINKING ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE WORSE THAN BEING IN THIS STATE AGAIN WITHOUT CAUSING YOURSELF TISSUE OR PSYCHOLOGICAL DAMAGE WHAT WOULD BE WORSE WELL COLD WATER WOULD BE WORSE FOR MANY PEOPLE VERY COLD WATER SO THE KEY IS TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING THAT FOR LACK OF A BETTER WAY TO PUT IT REALLY SOCKS REALLY SOCKS AND YET IS SAFE AND BY DOING THAT YOU STEEP IN THE TROUGH YOU STEEP IN THE SLOPE OF THE TROUGH WHICH WE KNOW BRINGS YOU BACK TO YOUR BASELONE LEVEL OF DOPA MEAN MORE QUICKLY NOW FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT WILL BE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE THROUGH COLD SHOWER ICE BATH AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT IF YOURE CRINGING AS I SAY THIS WELL THEN THERE YOU GO YOU NOW HAVE A TOOL THAT YOU KNOW YOU CRINGE EVEN WHEN YOU JUST THINK ABOUT AND THEREFORE REPRESENTS A GREAT TOOL FOR YOU SO IF I'M PROCRASTINATING TO DO SOMETH NG I REALLY NEED TO DO SHOULD I JUST SIMPLY WAIT FOR THAT PROCRASTINATION TO EVAPORATE NO WILL IT EVENTUALLY EVAPORATE MAYBE WILL AT DEADLINE EVENTUALLY SURFACE THAT WILL TRIGGER ME AN TO AND ANXIOUS OR ACTIVATED STATE THAT WILL ALLOW ME TO COMPLETE WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE MYBE HOPEFULLY BUT BETTER WOULD BE TO GET OUT OF THAT AMOTIVATED STATE THAT STATE OF PRECRASTINATION QUICKLY AND TO DO SO YOU NEED TO LEVERAGE SOMETHING THAT'S PAINFUL SO FOR INSTANCE I HEARD A BEAUTIFUL LECTURE RECENTLY ON BY DOCTOR ONOLEMPKI AT STAMFORT CHOOL OF MEDISONE DISCUSSING DOPOMIN AND SOME OF THE THINGS IN HER BOOK AND SOME NEWERE FINDINGS AS WELL AND SOMEBODY IN THE AUDIENCE ASKED FOR THE QUESTION DOES MEDITATION INCREASE DOPOMI NOW EARLY ARE WE TALKED ABOUT HOW NONSLY DEEP REST IN YEOGONEDRA HAS BEEN SHOWN IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE TO INCREASED DOPEMING BUT I ALSO MENTION EARLIER THAT CLASSIC FORMS OF MEDITATION WHETHER EYES OPEN OUR EYES CLOSED SO CALLED OPEN MONITORING OR CLOSED MONERING MEDITATION SITTING THERE LYING THERE AN FOCUSSING DOES NOT INCREASE DOPEMING LEVELS PERSAY HOWEVER FOR MOST PEOPLE SPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO FIND IT HARD TO MEDITATE OR WHO DON'T DO THAT PRACTICE VERY OFTEN MEDITATION IS EFFORTFUL GETTING INTO MEDITATION AND STAYING IN MEDITATION IS EFFORTFUL SO IF YOU FIND YOURSELF IN A STATE OF PRECRASTINATION OFTENTIMES A BRIEF FIVE TO TEN MINUTE MEDITATION WHERE YOU ABSOLUTELY DO NOT ALLOW YOURSELF TO DO ANYTHING BESIDES CLOSE YOUR EYES FOCUS ON YOUR BREATH AND WHEN YOUR MIND DRIFTS GET BACK TO YOUR BREATH IS NOT ONLY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AN EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING UNLESS YOU'RE WELL PRACTICED MEDITATOR BUT IT'S OFTEN DIFFICULT AND FRUSTRATING NOT JUST TO DO BUT TO GET INTO THAT PRACTICE AND NOT JUST TO GET INTO THAT PRACTICE BUT TO THE MAINTAIN THAT PRACTICE FOR THAT MERE FIVE TO TEN MINUTES BECAUSE IT'S JUST NOT A NATURAL STATE FOR US TO BE IN WE HAVE TO FORCE OURSELVES SO IT IS EFFORTFUL IN FACTID IT QUALIFIES AS A BASICALLY AVAILABLE ALMOST ANYWHERE ANY TIME TYPE OF EFFORTFUL ACTIVITY THAT IF YOU DISLIKE IT PERHAPS EVEN AS MUCH AS SOME PEOPLE DISLIKE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE WILL THEN PERFECT YOU NOW HAVE AN ADDITIONAL TOOL IN YOUR KIT THAT YOU CAN USE ANY TIME YOU ARE FEELING AMOTIVATED AND PROCRASTINATING NOW THERE ARE NUMEROUS EXAMPLES I COULD GIVE AND HOPEFULLY THERE ARE NUMEROUS EXAMPLES THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE KEY IS TO HAVE A SHORT LIST OF ABOUT FIVE DIFFERENT EFFORTFUL ACH A A PAINFUL ACTIVITIES THAT YOU CAN EMPLOY ANY TIME YOU'RE FEELING AMOTIVATED OR IN A STATE OF PRECRASTINATION KEEPING IN MIND THAT THE GOAL IS NOT WHAT YOU ACCOMPLISH INSIDE OF THAT ACTIVITY ALTHOUGH IT IS IMPORTANT TAT YOU ACTUALLY ENGAGE IN THAT ACTIVE  AC HAF TO MAKE MYSELF MEDITATE IN THAT FIVE TO TEN MINUTE WILL BOUT OF EFFORTFUL OR PAINFUL ACTIVITY BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT ACHIEVING AN OUTCOME IT'S ABOUT FORCING YOUR BODY IN MIND INTO A DEEPER STATE OF PAIN AND DISCOMFORT IN OTHER WORDS TAKING YOURSELF FROM THAT TROUGH THAT YOU'RE ALREADY IN AND STEEPENING AND DEEPENING THAT TROUGH BECAUSE IN STEEPENING AND DEEPENING THAT TROUGH WE KNOW THAT THE RETURN FROM THAT TROUGH TO NORMAL AND EVEN ELEVATED LEVELS OF BASELINE DOPOMINE IS GOING TO BE FASTER AND MORE ROBUST AND IN DOING THAT YOU WILL QUICKLY FIND YOURSELVES BACK INTO A MODE OF ADED STATE BECAUSE NOT ONLY DOES IT TEACH YOU THAT DOING HARD THINGS IS POSSIBLE THAT SORT OF IT MORE OF A SUBJECTIVE COGNITIVE LEARNING BUT IT ACTUALLY TAPS IN TO THE VERY NARROW CHEMICAL SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS YOU TO THEN FEEL MOTIVATED AND CAPABLE TO PURSUE THE LARGER GOAL WHICH IS THE THING YOU'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT AFTER ALL SO AS IS OFTEN THE CASE PERHAPS ALWAYS THE CASE ON THIS PODCAST WE COVERED A LOT OF MATERIAL WE COVER DOPAMINE AND WHAT IT IS WE TALKED ABOUT THE CIRCUITRY AND THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF CIRCUITRY FOCUSSING MAINLY ON THIS MESO CORTICAL PATHWAY THAT IS SO VITALLY IMPORTANT TO MOTIVATION FOR ANY GOALS TALKED ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PEAKS AND TROUGHS AND BASE LINES AND THE FOUNDDITIONAL TOOLS THAT ALLOW US TO SET AND MAINTAIN A HEALTHY BASELINE LEVEL OF DOPOMIN AS WELL AS WASTE TO PROTECT THAT BASE LINE LEVEL OF DOPOMIN AND WE TALKED ABOUT HOW TO GET OURSELVES OUT OF STATES OF PROCRASTINATION AND AMOTIVATION BY NOT JUST WATING OUT THOSE TROUGHS IN DOPOMING BUT ACTUALLY MAKING THOSE TROUGHS AN DOPOMIN STEEPER BY ENGAGING IN THINGS THAT ARE EFFORTFUL AND THINGS THAT WE REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO IN THOSES MOMENTS PROVIDED THAT THOSE THINGS ARE SAFE WE CAN GET OUT OF THOSE DOPOMIN TROUGHS MORE QUICKLY AND BACK TO OUR DOPOMING BASE LINE OR EVEN ABOVE BASE LINE AND WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT I REALLY VIEW AS THE HOLY GRAIL OF MOTIVATION WHICH IS TO BE ABLE TO LEARN TO ATTACH REWARD TO THE EFFORT PROCESS ITSELF AND TO DO SO BY NOT JUST UNDERSTANDING BUT ALSO LEARNING TO SUBJECTIVELY RECOGNIZE AND SUMMATICALLY EXPERIENCE RELEASE OF THESE DIFFERENT STRESTFUL CHEMICALS WITHIN OUR BODY I REALIZE THIS WAS A LOT OF INFORMATION AND YET THROUGHOUT I'VE TRIED TO HIGHLIGHT TOOLS THAT YOU CAN USE THAT RANGE FROM BEHAVIORAL TO NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTATION TOOLS COGNIVE TOOLS AND KEEP A MIND THAT ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF THE PODCAST AS ALWAYS ARE TIME STAMP SO IF

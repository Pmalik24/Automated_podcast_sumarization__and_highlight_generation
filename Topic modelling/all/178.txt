BOG DOWN BY SPECIOUS LEGAL CASES AND ELEVATED TOWARD THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL OMINATION BECAUSE OF THEM DONALD TRUMP FACES ALMOST INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLES TO THE WHITE HOUSE DEVEN ARCHER TELLS TUNKER CRAWSON ABOUT HIS SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH HUNTER AND BY NOMIX MEANS AMERICA'S CREDIT BEING DOWN GRATED I'M BEENSHKUR OF THIS IS BENCHPARA SHOW  THE BENSHPIRA SHOWS SPONS ROB EXPRESS VE PIAN I TALK ABOUT THEM EVERY SINGLE SHOW WHY HAVEN'T YOU GOTTIN IF E PIANYET GET EXPRESSIV PIAN RIGHT NOW AT EXPRESSIVE PANS I CAM SLASHMAN ALL RIGHTY SO TODAY THE FORMER PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES IS EXPECTED TO APPEAR IN PERSON FOR ITS ARRAINMENT IN FEDERAL COURT IN WASHINGTON D CS SOEREGONGTO GET ANOTHER O J SIMPSON DAY WHERE THE PRESIDENT IS TRAIL BY HELLACOPPTERS AS HE LEAVES MARLOGO AND THEN HE GETS ON A PLAN AND THN HO GOES TO WASHINGTON D C AND THN GOES INTO A COURTHOUSE AN THEN HE ACTETS A COURT HOUSE HON WEGONG T GET ALL THE USUAL HOLLABALOO ABOT HOW THIS IS HISTORIC AND IT'S THE BIGGEST THING THAT'S HAPPENED IN TE UNITED STATES SINCE EVERER AN IT'S LIKE AN AMAZING AMAZING DAY FOR E LEFT THAT A'LL GONGTO BE CELEBRATIG THATALL GOIN O BE  WHOING IT'S GOING O BE SO EXCITING WE'VE DONE THIS SEVERAL TIMES AT THIS POINT BECAUSE TRUM OF COURSE HAD TO GO TO NEW YORK FOR ARRAINMENT AND THEN HE HAD TO BE IN FLORIDA AND MAAMI FOR ARRINMENT NAAS BEEN WASHINGTON TO SEE FORN RAYMENT SOAT'S THE ARRAINMENT WORLD TO ER HERE WITH THE WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAGN AND THIS IS NOT DONAL TRUMPSFALL BECAUSE THIS INDITEMENT I'S GARBAGE THE INDICTMENT AS I DISCUSSED YESTERDAY HIS CHARGEING CRIMES THEY'RE NOT ACTUAL CRIMES THEY THEY ARE SUGGESTING THAT DONAL TRUM FOR EXAMPLE COMMITTED  SOME SORT OF FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES WHICH IS A LI THAT IS NOT IN FACT HOW THAT WALL WORKS WUT THEY WANTED TO CHARGED HIM WITH WAS INCITEMENT BUT THEY REALLY WANT HIS CHARGE MITH WAS HE IS THE ONE WHO CREATED THE RION ON JANUARY SIX BUT THE PROBIMENCE DOESN'T FULFILL THE ACTURAL ELEMENTS OF INCITEMENT BECAUSE INCITEMENT UNDER AMERICAN WAW REQUIRES THE ACTUALLY TELL PEOPLE TO GO DO THE THING I'S NOT ENOUGH TO SAY WELL YOU NOW I REALLY REALLY DON'T LIKE THATGUY AND THEN SOMEBODY GOES THEY BURN DOWN THE GUY'S HOUSE THAT'S NOT ENOUGH YEFT SAY I WANT YOU GO TO THAT GUY'S HOUSE AND BURN DOWN HIS HOUSE AND HEARS HIS ADDRESS AND TAT THE LATTER IS INCITEMENT TRUM DIDN'T DO THAT HE'S SAID ON JANUARY SIX GO PEACEFULLY PROTEST PATRIOTICALLY PROTEST AT THE CAPITAL BUILDING AND THEN HE DIDN'T DO ENOUGH TO GET PEOPLE OUT BUT AGAIN THAT'S NOT THE SAME THINGS INCITEMENT THAT IS NOT AN ACTUAL CRIME IS JUST HIM BEING A BAD PRESIDENT AT THAT TIME WHICH AGAIN HIS ACTIVITIES DURING JANUARY SIX I THINK WE'R GREGES I THING HIS ACTIVITIES BETWEEN THE ELECTION IN JANUARY SIX PARTICULARLY IN THE AFTERMOUTH OF STATE CERTIFICATION OVOTES I THING IT WAS WRONG I THING WAS FALSE HITHING IS NONE OF THAT IS CRIME IT TURNS IT CAN DO LOTS OF THINGS IN AMERICA THAT I PERSONALLY THINK OUR GREEGOUS WRONG IN DAMAGING TO TE COUNTRY THEY'RE NOT CRIMES HAPPENS PRETTY MUCH ALL THE TIME AND EVERY SINGLE DAY SO FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AGAIN HE'S GOING TO SHOW UP IN WASHINGTON D C IN ORDER TO BE ARRAINS AND THIS JUST UNDER SCORES THE FACT THAT NOT ONLY COULD PRESIDEN TRUMPS LIFE BE AT RISK HERE BECAUSE HE NOW FACES SEVENTY EIGHT FELLOONGY CHARGES ACROSS THREE CRIMINAL CASES IF TRUMP WERE CONVICTED ON ALL COUNTS ACCORDING TO POLITICO AND GIVEN THEM ACTOMUM STATUTORY PENALTY FOR EACH ONE HE WOULD FACE A WOPPING SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE YEARS IN PRISON WHICH I SOON MEANS HOU AD NOTS OR OUT PRISON ALTHOUGH HE IS SEVENTY PER CENT PRESERVATIVES AT THIS POINT BECAUSE HE EATS SO MUCH MC DONALDS AND DIACOKE THAT IS NOT COUNTING ADDITIONAL CRIMINAL CHARGE YOU YOU MIGHT FACE IN GEORGIA THE ACTUAL PLAUSIBLE CRIMINAL TERM IS PROBALY NOTHING LIKE THAT IN BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL COURSE JUDGES HAVE WIDE LATITUDE IN SENTENCING NONE OF THE CRIMES TRUMP HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH CARRY MANDITORY MINMUM SENTENCE THE FENNS WITH NO PRIR CRIMINAL RECORD RARELY RECEIVE THE MAXIMUM AND SENDING TRUM TO PRISON COULD RAISE PRETTY ON PRESIDENT TOF PRACTICAL AN LEGAL ISSUES GIVEN THE FACTIT RIGHT NOW HE'S THE MOST LIKELY PERSON O BE THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT SO THERE IS THE ACTUAL REAL POSSIBILITY THE DONALTRUM COULD BE CAMPAIGNING FROM PRISON IN THE MIDDLE OF NEXT YEAR WHICH AGAIN HI DRAMA AND MAYBE I MEAN I WOULD LOVE AS YE A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IN WHICH JOBIDON BEING CORRUPT THI HUNTER AND HAVING VIOLATED THE LOCYOU COULD THE OREDICALLY HAVE A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IN WHICH YOU HAVE THE CANDIDATES IN ACTUAL JAIL SELLS A CROSS FROM EACH OTHER AT FULLSOM AND JUST SHOUTING AT EACH OTHER ACROSS THE HALLWAY AS FLAMING BED SHEETS FALL AROUND THEM WHICH FRANK LOULD BE MORE ANCERTAINING THE MOST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES AT THIS BY BUTT IS THIS A MISCARRIAGE OF JUST AS YT IN THIS INDICTMENT SHUNOTCO FOR IT I DISCUSSED IT AT LENGTH YESTERDAY NOT ONLY THAT IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT JACKSMITH WANTS THI STUFF PROSECUTED LIKE AS FAST AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE THONNALTRUMPS DEFENCITORNY JOHN LAURO HE SAID PROSECUTORS WANT A FORCE TO TRIAL IN SIXTY TO NINETY DAYS SO IF I GET MY MOUTHRIGHT THAT MEANS THAT THEY WANT TA FORCE THE TRIAL IN LIKE OCTOBER NOVEMBER AT SOME TIME PRESUMABLY BEFORE THE PRIMARIES BEGIN THE PROSCATORS THATS LET'S GO TO TRIAL I'M READY AND SEVENTY DAYS FAIRE NOT EARE NOT READY AND SEVENTY DAYS HOW BI NI R HA I I TRI HAV I E PRI AIS OUT HE HAVE THREE AND A HALF HEARS FLATIL MAKE IT EPALL WHAT A THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THEY HAVE SIXTY FEDERAL AGENTS WORKING ON THIS SIXTY LAWYERS ALL KINDS OF GOVERNMENT A PERSONEL AND AND WE GET THIS AN DIVVEN AND THEY WANT TO GO TO TRIALIN NINETYDAYS TUST THAT SOUN LIKE JUSTICE TO YOU ON M A JUST IN THE PRIS IER TI WES IN NEVER A I TS AO TE TRIAL IS ATU AIS TO FORCE A FORMER PRES IN THE INIVITED STATES TO TRIAL IN NINETY DAYS WHEN YOU'VE HAV THREE YEARS TLISI WELL NOW TO THER'RE THEY'RE TWO THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING RIGHT HERE FROM A A SORT OF POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE ONE IS THE ENTIRE ELECTION TYCHAEL WILL NOW BE ABOUT JANUARY SIXTH O BOUT TON TRUM'S ACTIVITIES IS LEGAL ACTIVITIES THO BOUT CLASS BY DOCUMENTS THAT IS WHAT THE ELECTION'S GOING TO BE ABOUT AND THAT IS WHAT DEMOCRATS WANT THE ELECT YOUN DO ABOUT THEY WOULD LOVE NOTHING BETTER HAN THAT IS WHY Y HAVE MICHAEL BISH LOSS WIS THE WORLD'S WORST HISTORIAN AND WRITE SPEECHES FOR JOBIDON COMPARING JANUARY SIX TO NINE ELEVEN WHICH AGAIN THIS IS SUCH AN ABSURDITY I'M SORRY JANUARY SIX WAS A WAS A RALLY THAT TURNED INTO A FAIRLY SMALL SCALE RIOT IN THE CONTACT OF THE TWENTY TWENTY RICES WICERS MOST DAMAGING RIOTS AN AMERICAN HISTORY AND FROMS A PROPERTY DAMAGE AND AND YOU MANY LIVES WERE LOST MICHAEL BISH LOST COMPARING A BUNCH OF DULTS GOING INTO THE CAPITAL BUILDING AND BY THE WAY KILLING NO ONE O KA BECAUSE THTHE REALITY IS THAT THE ONE OFFICER WHO DIED BRIN SICNAC DIED AFTERWARD AND IT IS UNCLEAR THAT THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS DIRECTLY RELATED TO JANUARY SEX BUTT PUT ALL THAT THE ONLY PERSON OMACTUALLY WAS KILLED THAT THEY WAS ACTUALLY BABIT OF COURSE COMPARING THAT TO NINE ELEVEN AND WHICH THREE THOUS AN AMERICANS DIED IN A FULL SKALL ATTACK ON THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING BOTH THE WORLD'S RATESCENTER AND THE PENDAGON COMPARING THAT TO PEARL HARBOR I MICHAELBISHLOSSES HE HIS A TERRIBLE HISTORIAN BUT THIS IS THE NARRATIVE PEARL HARBOR NINETEEN FORTY ONE WE WERE BOND PERSISTEN WAS VERY MUCH IN DANGER OUR DEMOCRACY MANY PEOPLE WERE GETTING ADOC CRAN CAY THET THEYLD DO THE DEMOCRACY HAT SY THITS LAST DAYS PRAT

PLABOOCK AN TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND IT ACTUALLY WENT PRETTY WELL FOR THEM I REMEMBER A LOT OF US WERE RETTY EXERCISED ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS STILL THE WORST PRECIDENTIAL SPEECH I'VE EVER SEEN GIVEN JO BION'S BIZAR AND FISHISTIC SPEECH IN FRUNT OF INDEPENDENCE HALL WERE HE COMPLETELY MISS RED WHAT LIBERTY IS AND THEN DECLARED OLIFIS POLITICAL OPPONENT'S ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC BLOOD READ INDE PENDANCE HALL WITH THE SOLDIERS FLANKING INTHE BACKGROUND YOUREMEMBER ALL OF THAT BUT IT ACTUAY WORKED OUT FAIRLY WELL POLITICALLY FOR MS O DEMOCRATS ONE A RE RUN THAT PLAYBOOKS THAT IS POINT NUMBER ONE POINT NUMBER TWO IS THAT IF YOU BOG DOWN YOU'R POLITICAL OPPONENTS WITH BLOSS YOUD AFTER LOSS YOULD AFTER LAWSUIT CRIMINAL CASE HAVETER CRIMINAL CASE HAVER CR THAT THAT KEEPS HIM PRETTY BUSY AND NOT ONLY THAT IF YOU HAID WITH BUNCH CRINAL CASES THEY'RE PRETTY OBVIOUSLY POLITIALLY MOTIVATED IT ELEVATES HIM IN THE PRIMARIES SO DEMOCRATS ARE GETING HIN ALL THE THINGS THEY WANT HERE ELL GET TO THAT IN JUST ONE  SECOND FIRST LET US TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT BIG TAC BIG GOVERNMENTHESE ARE NOT TRUST WORTHY SOURCES THEY'LD LIKE TO SILENCE O ANY DESCENTING VOICES INTO  SUBMISSION IN FACT TEY WORK

LASH MAN TO LEARN IT MORE O CASO THIS IS IN A FACT IN ATTEMPT TO QON QHAT RIG THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ELECTION AGAIN WHEN I SAY RIG I MEAN IT IN THSE SORT OF GENERIC SCENSE I DON'T MEAN AELECT TORAL FRAUD I DON'T MEAN DEMOCRATS SHIPPING IN BALLA BOX IN MIDDLE TLE NIGHT OR DEAD PEOPLE VOTING IN CHICAGO IN NINETEEN SIXTY OR STEALING IN ELECTION FOR AL FRANK AN OVER NORM COL MEN IN MINISODA THAT STUFF DOES HAPPEN THAT'S ON I'M TALKING BOUT HERE WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THE PREE RIGGING OF THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ELECTION BY ESSENTIALLY MAKING DONALD TRUMP THE REPUBLICAN NOMINY KNOWING THAT THE AMOUNT OF BAGGAGE HE BRINGS INTO THE GENERAL IS GOING TO DRAG HIM DOWN IN THE GENERAL ELECTION BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MOST PREDICTIBLE WAY THAT THE SELECTION CYCEL GOES IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT INDEPENDENTS ARE GOING TO THINK LIKE RE PUBLICANS AND CON SERVATEDS ON THESE ISSUES HEIS MOST PEOPLE DON'T WATCH THE STUFF AT THE GRANUAR LEVELLIES HE LISTEN TO THE SHOW YOU'RE MORE POLITICALLY IN FORMED THAT ABOUT NINETY EIGHT PER CENTS OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THE REST OF HE PUBLIC A HUGE PER SENDICE OFTH PUBLIC DOES NOT FOLLOW THE STUFF CLOSELY AND SO HES WHEN THEY SEE HEADLINE AFTER HEADLINE AFTER HEADLINE SUGGESTING THAT DONAL TRUMP IS A CRIMINAL IF THEY ARE NOT IN THE FORTY PER CENT BASE OF DONAL TRUMP IF THEY'RE IN THAT TEN PER CENT WHICH TENDS TO BE LESS INGAGED TENDS TO BE LESS INFORMED WHICH TENDS TO NOTLESS IN TO CON SERVATOFE PODCAFTS BUT MAY TURN ON  SEAN AN EVERY SO OFTEN THAT THE  THE PEOPLE WHO CATCH THE NEWS WHEN THE'R NOT READING SPORT SECTION FOR THOSE PEOPLE DOYOU THIN TE'REGOING TO BE GRAN YULOTALLY INVOLVED AN WHETHER THE GO JA WAS WEAPONIZED AGAIN STONAL TRUMP BECAUSE AFTER ALL DONAL TRUMP HAS BEEN ARGUING THAT FOR YEARS HEO WAS RIGHT BUT THOSE ARGUMENTS CIN NOT ARE BAKED IN TO THE CAKE SO THE QUESTION BE COMES BOTH PRACTICAL AND MESSAGEON ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL HOWISDONAL TRUMPKIN CAN TEN WITH THE FACT THAT HE IS LIKELY TO HAVE AT LEAST FOUR ON GOING CRIMINAL TRIALS IN THE IDDLE OF THE SELECTION CYCL HUSGANTO DO THAT WE ALREADY KNOW THAT HIS SUPERPACK IS PENDING EVERY DOLLAR THEYAVE RAISED ALL OF THEM ON HIS LEGALFIE'S RIGHT NOW SO FIRSTAL DONAL TRUMPS MOST BE A BILLIONER HE SHOULDN'T BE USING HIS SUPERPACK MONEY FOR THAT DONAL TRUMP SHOULD BE PAYING HIS OWN LEGAL BILLS AND WHEN YOU DON'T ANET MONEY T DONAL TRUMP IT SHOULD NOT GO TOWARD HIS LEGAL DEFENSE IT SHOULD GO TOR TO FEEDING JOBIDON BY BUILDING UP A GRASS RETES OPERATION TIT'S A SIMPLE POLITECS BUT PUT THAT SIDE EN FYOUR FINE WEAT BY WAY DONL TRUMP COULD AVE STARTEDTO SEPPERAT LEGAL FUN AND THEN IF HOE WANTED TO GIVE TO HIS LEGAL FUN YOU COULD OF THE SOWIT HE DID BUT PUT ALL THAT ASIDE EVERY DOLLOR DONALD TRUMP IS BRINGING IN IS BEING SPENT RIGHT NOW ON LEGAL EVERY MOMENT THE DONALD TRUMP IS ON LINE IS BEING SPENT THINKING ABOUT LEGAL EVERYSTO OFTEN HE SIDES SWIPES RON TO SANTIST JUST CAN A KEEP HEM DOWN BUT MOST OF HIS FOLK IS RIGHT NOW IS GOING TO BE ON THE LEGAL CASES AND RANCING ABOUT JACK SMITHAN STUFF HERE WHALL THAT'S AN AWFUL EXSPENDITURE OF TIME FOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO NEEDS TO RUN IN ELECTION IN SWING STATES IN ORDER TO WIN BEYOND THAT THINK OUT THE PRACTICALITIES THING ABOUT THE COURT DATES THING ABOUT WHERE HE ACTUALLY HAS TO PHYSICALLY BE IN MANY OF THESE CASES HE'S GON TO HAVE TO BE FOR DAYS OR WEEKS IN FLORIDA FOR FOR HIS CASE ON CLASSVI DOCUMENTS OR N WASHINGTON YOU SEIVE FOR FOR THE GENEROL SIXTH INDITEMENTS OR IN GEORGE OV FOR ALECT TORAL INTERFERENCE IS ITEMENTS THAT ARE SHORTLY TO BE COMING OR IN NEW YORK FOR THESTORBY DANIELS NONSENSE HE'S GENOUGH TO BE IN ALL OF THIS PLACE JUST ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL IS THE VERY VERY DIFFICUL CASE FOR DONALD TRUMP TO RUN IT'S A VERY ROUGH RACE BECAUSE THEY'VE SET UP ALL O THESE DOPSCALS GAIN THIS WI SA ITSBEEN RAD ONCE YOU BRING A BUNCH OF SPECIES ALLIGATIONS AGAINST TRUMP AND YOU LOCK HIM UP IN TRUMS OF HIS TIME IN HIS MONEY FOR THE NEXT YOU'RE AND A HALF THAT IS A FORM OF RIGGING THE ELECTION AND AS A ATS ANOTHER COMPONENT OF THIS BY DOING THIS YOU'RE ALSO HELPING TO RIG THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES IN A BAZAR SORT OF WAY WHEN ALL OF THE MEDEA COVERAGE GOES TOR DONALD TRUMP IT' SUCKS ALL THE AR OUT ROOM NOBODY ELSE CAN COMPETE IT MEANS THAT DONALD TRUMP WITH ALL OF HIS BAGGAGE IS LIKELY TO BE THE NOMINE TBECAUSE EVERYBODY ON THE REPUBLICANSIDE OF THE AL MYSELF INCLUDED WE ALL LOOK AT TRUMPET MERE LIKE THAT I'S BEING VICTIMIZED AND WE WOULD LIKE TO GIVE HIM AS MUCH POWER AS HE CAN HAVE AN OR TO SMACK BACK I GET IT I TOTALLY GET IT BUT THERE'S THE THING IF HE LOSES NONE OF THAT THTHE POWER OF A NOMINATION IS NO GREATER THAN TH POWER OF A NOT NOMINATION THE POWER OF THE PRESIDENCY IS THE THING YOU NEED IF DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T WIN GIVING HIM THE NOMINATION THE NACTHL HELP HIM ONE I OD UP LIKE NOT ONE LITTLE BIT YOU NEED SOMEBODY WHO CAN WIN IF THAT PERSON WINS PRESUM THEY CULD PARDON HIM THEORETICALLY OF FEDERAL CHARGES THEY COULD REMAKE THE DEEO JA THAT'S THE THNG WE SHOULDALL BE FOCASET ON IF WE ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT FIXING THE SYSTEM AND MAKING SURE THE Y DON'T GET BAD INDICTMENTS AGAINST POLITICAL OPPONENTS BUT THAT REQUIRE'S VICTORIES THE QUESTION REALLY AS ALWAYS COMES BACK TO VICTORY SO AGAIN THAT'S THE PRACTIC OUT THAT'S THAT'S PRACTICALLI NUMBER ONE IS HIS TIME BEING STACKED UP I HIM BEING BASICALLY JAMED OP ALL THE WAY UNTIL ELECTION DAY WITH CRIMINAL CASES AND THEN AGAIN THERE'S MESSAGE NUMBER TO WHICH IS THE MESSAGE IS DEMOCRATSIC IN A RAM DOWN PUSH IT PUSH IT PUSH A PUSH IN AND THESE CRIMINALL CASES ALLOW THEM TO DO IT EVERYDAY  TRUMPS CAN BEING COURT TALKM AT IT EVERYDAY AN TRUE SOSIAL TALKING BOUT IF THERE'S IF THERE'S ONE PERSON WHO LIKES TALKING ABOUT TRUMP MORE THAN JOBIDNIST DONAL TRUMP HE LOVES IT IS FAVORITE THING WE IN AN ENTIRE LECTION CYCLE OF THAT SO MAYBE THAT' SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE UP FOR FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES OR BE CUT OUT OF LOYAL TEA TO TO TRUMP ON SOME SORT OF PERSONAL LEVEL I I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR IT I GET IT I'M JUST ASKING IS THE THING THAT IS MOST LIKELY TO RESULT IN ACTUAL IN ACTUAL VICTORY AS WELL SE IN A SECON IRE'S QUITE POT PROBABLE THAT JOBIDON BASICALLY SET ALL OF THIS UP AT LEST

ROUGH GREENS BRING YORD DOG'S FOOD BACK S LIKE THAT IS AR OU F F GREENS DOT TOMSLASH BEN TODAY OR CALL EIGHT THREE THREE MY DOG THIRTY THREE THAT IS EIGHT THREE THREE MY DOG THIRTY THREE O CAESO DID JOBIDON RIG A LOT OF THIS SORT OF STUFF I MEAN THE ANSWER IS A CANTISOUNDS LIKE IT THIS AN ARTICLE FROM MARCH THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE A FEW MONTHS AGO BID INSAID WHAT THE BIDIN JUSTISCE TO PARTINALL DO HAS LET THET A PRITMEN OF JUSTICE BEET TE DEPARTMEN OF JUSTICE LET THEM MAKE THE JUDGMENTS IF WE SHOULD BE PROSECUTED THEY'RE NOT MY LAWYERS THEY ARE NOT MY PERSONAL LAWYERS BUT AND THER'S THE NEAR TIME'S REPORTING BACKIN MARCH HE DOES HAVE OPINIONS IN THE PAST MISTER BIDON PRIVATELY TOLD HIS CLOSE CIRCLE OF ADVISERS THEN MISTER TRUM POSED A THREATS A DEMOCRACY AND SHOULD BE PROSECUTED FOR HIS ROLLE IN THE EVENTS OF JANUARY SIX ACCORDING TO TWO PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH HIS COMMENTS HE ALSO TOLD CONFIDANCE HE WANT TAT AT TURNNG GENERAL MERIC GARLAN TO STOP ACTING LIKE A PONDEROUS JUDGE AND TO TAKE DECISIVE ACTIONS WELL THAT'S WEARD THAT HE THEN DID THOSE THINGS AND THIS A VERY MUCH LIKE WHEN BROCABAMA SAID WOULDN IT BE GREAT OF THE IRUS WOULDN'T BE GRIGG IF THE IRUS WHON AFTER ALL MY OLITICAL OPONENTS THOU' BE GREGT THIT IS OVERT AND THEN MAGICALLY THE IRESS DID JUST THAT THEN PEOPLE LE DIDN'T ORDER THEM TO DO IT RIGHT WHEN YOU SAY PUBLICALLY YOU WANT THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR YOU TO DO A THING TYPICALLY THEY TEND TO DO THE THING IF I WERE TO SUGGEST ON MY SHOW THAT I WANT MY TEAN TO  GET ME A BIRTHDAY CAKE TOMORROW FOR NO REASON I SSUME SOMEBODY WOULD PROBABLY HEAR THAT AND MAYBE ELL GET BIRTHDA CAKE TOMORROW YOUVE IN VITIN IN EXPLICITLY TELL HIM BY THE WAY GOS HOUN NE THEBIRTHDA CAKE BUT THAT'S THE THAT IS THE WAY THAT THIS SORT OF STUFF WORKS WHEN TE BOSS SAYS A THING AND HE SAYS IT IN PUBLIC HE SUBORDINATES TEN TO DO THE THING IS IT A COINCIDENCE THAT JOBIDON WANTED THESE THINGST HAPPENIN NOW THEY ARE MAGICALLY HAPPENING IS IT ALSO A COINCIDENCE THAT BAROCABAMA APPARENTLY TOLD  JOBIDEN EARLIER THE SUMMER THE DONALD TRUMPS POLITICAL STRENGTHS COULD ACTUALLY BE A PROBLEM FOR HIM AND SO MAYBE MAYBE IT MIGHT BE KIN AN NICE IF SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO THAT FI RID A MEN IF HE JUST GOT HIT WITH BUNCH MEN DITEMENS THAT ATN'N IBAPEN THAT WOULDN'T GET TERRIBLE THING ACCORDING TO WASHINGTON POSED AT THE WUNCH HELP THEM LATE JUNE AT THE WITE HOUSE PRESIENTS O BOMA PROMISE TO DO ALL HE COULD TO HELP GET THE PRESIDENT REELECTED ACCORDING TO TWO PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE METING BUT HE ALSO WARNED THAT DONAL TRUMPS POLITICAL STRENGTHS INCLUDING INTENSELY LOYL FOLLOWING A TRUMP FREMLY CON CERVET OF MEDIA EKO SYSTEM IN A POLERIZED COUNTRY UNDER LINE HIS WORRY THAT TRUMP COULD BE A MORE FORMIDABLE CANDIDATE THAN MANY DEMOCRAT'S REALIZE I KNOW WHAT IS A A GREAT WAY TO A UNDERCUT THAT OPPOSITION IS BY LOCKING HIM UP WITH MUNCH OF FALSE LEGAL CHARGES THAT COULD IN WASHINGTON HE SEE QUITE PROBABLY RESULT IN A CONVICTIOD NO CAOLL FROM A FIDERA PROSECUTOR HE SAYS THISWILL ALMOST CERTAINLY RESULT IN A CONVICTION WHICH AGAIN IT'S IN WASHINGTON HE SEE SO YATHER'S REAL GO CHOT I FREES FEATURE I ME TRUMCE TEFENCE THI N WELL ID JUST SET ID I IN ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING BUT THAT IS NEVER EAR IF FENCE TO   WIG FEW IT O Y YEO DON'T ORDER YOU TO KILL SOME ONE IT O OR YO ON CONSPIRE WITH YOU TO KILL SOMEWHEEON THROUGH MY WORDS OR IT IS O LIKE THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I LIKE ONCES ONLY SPEECH THERE FOR I CAMP BE PROSECUTEDED THAT'S THOROUGHLY BOGES I THING WERE GENERALLY CACSTES AN DITMENT ERE IS STRAIGHTFORWARD AD NARROW BUT POY PACKS A PUNCH AS CEEN ITS CALCULATED AND I FEEL I IT'S ALMOST CERTAINLY OINT RESULTS IN A CONVICTION IT IS NOT CLEAN IT IS NOT CALCULATED ITS NOT PACK A PUNCH IT IS AN OP AD MASKA RATING AS AN INDICTMENT BUT DOESN'T MATTERS ON WASHINGTON TO SE TERE'S EVERY POSSIBILITY THE DONAL TRUMP COULD BE CONVICTED AND AND CONVICTED IN SHORT ORDER IN WASHINGTON DOSEE AND TERMS OS DANGER TO TRUMP AGAIN THERE GET STACK IT UP IN SORT OF TO CATEGWORIES ONE IS THE ACTUAL SOLIDITY OF THE LEGAL CASE IN TERMS OF THE SOLIDITY OF THE LEGL CASES THAT ARE CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING AGAINST TRUMP ON THE CRIMINAL BASIS BY FAR THE MOST GRAVE CHARGES OF THE CLASSFI DOCUMENTS CHARGES THOSE ONES THERE'S PRETTY SOLID EVIENCE THET TRUMP DID THE THING AT'S NOT WITH REGARD TO THE POLITICAL CONCERNS THE BOLITICAL CONCERN OF COURSE IS THE DOUBLE STAND WITHTHILERY BITS A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING IN TERMS UP WHICH CHARGES RE THE MOST DANGEROUS AND TROMS THE STUFF THAT TRUMP HAS VIOLATED THE RANKINGS GO FLORTA CASE DESE INDICTMENT WHICH AGAIN IS SPECIUS AND MANHATTON INDICTMENT WHICH IS SUPERDUPER SPECIES IN TERMS OF ACTUAL DANGER TO GO TO JAIL DESE IS BY FAR NUMBER ONE BY FAR NUMBER ONES S ITS A WASHINGTON DESEY JURY AND TAT I'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THIS CASE AND DEMOCRATS KNOW IT THEY WANT O JAM HIM UP THIS IS IT IS RIGGING IT WHEN IF IF SUDDENLY THE REBUNCH OF LEGAL CASES THAT AROSE AGAINST JO BIDON JUST PRIOR TO THE ELECTION IN WHICH HE HAD TO SIT IN THE DOC MUNCH OF DEAS DECIDED TO JUST TRY HIM MONTH AFTER MONTH AFTER MONTH FOR BUNCH OF SPECIOUS CHARGES YES THAT WOULD BE A FORM OF ELECTION RIGGING IN THE SAME WAY S FROM A FLECTION RIGGING WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LITERALLY LIE TWO PEOPLE ABOUT WHETHER HUNTER BY NS LABTOP WAS REAL CAUSING SOCIAL MEDEOS ENSERSHIP OF THE NEWORPOST STORY AN THE OTHER MESSACERE OF COURSE AS I'VE SAID IS THE DEMOCRATIC MESSAGE WHICH IS THAT DONAL TRUMP IS THE WORST PERSON TO EVER PERSON AND A NANCY POLOCY IS TROTTING NOW WENT OUT IT' SHE APPARENTLY SHE'S HEARTBROKEN THERE IS NOTHING I HATE MORE THAN CROCODILES HERE AS THIS IS LIKE CROCODILE TEARS JUST IN EXTREMUS YOU HAVE A SINGULAR EXPERIENCE OF GEINRSEC ON AS YOUREAD THE INDITMENT WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION AN WHAT JUMP DOWN TO YOU IT'S HAR BRAKING FOR OUR COUNTRY TO AVE E PRESIDENT OF THE NIGHT TAT A WIT THIS A LIS THE TAGIS AGAINST HIM AND I JUSTPAN IT CONONED THAT A DANIUELLISIN IT IRBRON NATY THE HALTH COMMITTEE BY PARTITIN COMMITTEE THANY TOMSONIN THIS TANY IN ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IN THE STAT FOR THE WORK THAT THEY DID THEY MADE A FOUNDATION OF FACTS ABOUT FACTS AND THE LAW AND MADE A CRIMINAL REFERO TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SO IM SHE SEEMS VERY HEARTBROKEN DOESN'T SHE OR MAYBE SHE SUPERHABY THIS GUESTS TO BE THE NARRATIVE GOING FORWARD AND THIS LEADS US TO OUR FAVORITE THING TWO TH HINGS CAN BE TRUE AT ONCE HIM A GET TO ALL THE THINGS THT CN ME TRA ONCE IN JUST ONE SECOND FIRST THIS SHOW IS SUPPORTED BY GRAN CANYON UNIVERSITY GRAN CANYUVERS IE VISITED IT'S A BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL PLACE IT'S AN AFFORDABLE PRIVATE CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY WITH A VIBRANT CAMPUS IN PHOENIX ARIZONA ITS RANK TOP TWENTY IN THE COUNTRY ACCORDING TO NECHE DOT TOM G C O IS OMISSIONAL CHRIST SENTSERE UNIVERSITY THAT STRIVES TO FOSTER A CULTUR OF COMMUNITY GIVING AND IMPACT G CS GOAL IS HELP YOU DEVELOPINGTO A SERVANT LEADER WHO MAKES AT DIFFERENCE THROUGH FINDINGYOUR PURPOSE AND FULFILLING AT GODS APPLANCE

TO HELPING YOU AF CHEVER GULLS FIND YOUR PURPOSE AT G C U GRAN CANYON UNIVERSITY PRIVATE CHRISTIAN AFFORTABLE VHISA G C U DOT E T U TO DAY AGA SO NOW GET TO THE TWO THINGS COM ME TRO ONCE IT CAN BE TRUE THE DEMOCRATES ARE TRINGS RIG THE ELECTION IN THEIR OWN FAVOR BY IT BOTH ELEVATING TONAL TRUMP IN THE PRIMARIES AND ALSO DEGRADING HIM IN THE GENERAL WITH ALL THESE LEGAL CASES WHICH ACHIEVE ALL OF THOSE THINGS BOTH FOR NARRATIVE PURPOSE AND FOR ACTURAL PRACTICAL DAY TO DAY TIME ON TARGET PURPOSES FOR ADONALD TRUMP AT CAN ALSO BE TRUE THAT DONALD TRUMP MADE SOME OF THIS BAD HIMSELF AN MEAN THEREARE LOT OFPEOPLE ARE VERY ANGRY AT MY PENCE TODAY CAN AND ANYTHING THAT MI PENCE SHOULD HAE COME OUT STRONG AGAINST THE INDITMEND I HER AGAIN I THINK THATHE SHULD HAVE I THIN YE SHUL HAVE SAID THIS INDICTMENT IS SPECIES  DOESN'T APPEAR TO TO B LEGALLY PRADICATED BUT MI PENCE WAS ALSO THE GY WHO DONALD TRUMP WAS LYING ABOUT FOR LIKE THREE MONTHS TWO WAS THE PERSON WHO WHO DONAL TRUMP WAS WAS BASICALLY DIRECTING ALL IER IN THE UNIVERSE AT HIS OWN VICE PRESIDENT WHO BEEN ABSOLUTELY LOYAL TO HIM FOR FOUR YEARS THERE WIS NO MORE LOYAL SERVANT OF DONALD TRUMPS POLICY POSITIONS IN THE WHITE HOUSE THEN MY PENCE FOR FOUR LONG YEARS AND ONA TIME TRUMP SWIVELED ON HIM AND JUST CLOCKED HIM IN THE FACE REPEATEDLY BY LINE IT WAS A LIE THAT MY PENCE HAD THE UNILATERAL ABILITY TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION IT IS NOT TRUE JUST AS COMALA HARRIS AS NOT HAVE THE UNILATERAL ABILITY TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION AND I'M CONSTANTLY AMAZED BY ANY ONE WHO GIVES ANY CREDENCE TO THIS LEGAL THEORY AND THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO WARE DOING IT FOR LIKE SEVERAL MONTHS I I CAN'T SEE ANY REASON TO DO IT OTHER THAN FOR A A SORT OF NEFARIOUS PURPOSE IN IN THE SENSCE OF A SELPHAGRANDIZEMENT BECAUSE IT WAS SO OBVIOUSLY LEGUALLY SPECIES AN AND SILLY THICE PRESIDENT DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SIMPLY PUT ASIDE STATE CERTIFIED VOTES IF HE DID THEOULD MAKE HIM A DICTATOR THAT'S SILLY CA BUT NO TWO THINGS CAN BE TRO ONCE TRUMP PENCE SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT THE INDICTMENT IS SPECIES AND ALSO DONALD TRUMP RATICALLY MISTRETED MY PENCE THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THIS AND MA PENCE IS NOT WRONG TO TALK ABOUT THAT HERE IS PENCE TALKING ABOUT THAT YESTERDAY LET'S LET'S BE CLEAR ON THIS POR THERE WASN'T JUST THE ASK FOR PAUS A THE PRESIDENT TA SPECIFICALLY ASK MAN HIS GAGGOL O VA OF CRACK PO LAWYERS ASKED ME THE LITERALLY REJECT VOTS TE WHICH WOULD HAVE RESULT TO IN TA IN THE ISSURE BEING TURNED OVER TO THE HOUSE OF RE PRESENTATIVES AND LITERALLY CAOS WOT OVIN SUR SO O MARTHA JUST THE PEOPLE PEOPLE CANARE THE AN DI MANN FRANKLY II SA BEFORE ID HOPE THAT IT NOT COME TO THIS POIT TI I DON'T KNOW IF THE GOVERNMENT CAN ME THE STANDARD THE BURDN O PROVE BE OD REASONABLE DOUBT A FOR CREVITAL CHARGES BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO KNOW A THE PRESIDENT TROP A AT IS ADVISERS I DIDN'T JUST ASK ME TO PAS THE ASK ME TO REJECT POTS RETURN VOTES ESSENTIALLY TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION DON'T BE ANGRA MY PENCE RO DON TRUMPTED AND I'M SORRY YOU CN ME ANGRY MY PENCE FOR AGAIN NOT COMING OUT AGAINST THE INCECTMENT STRONG BUT IT'S SOWN TRUMP WHO MADE ITS BED WITH REGARD TO MY PENCE SO TRUM THEN TWEETED OUT I FEEL BADLY FOR MY PENCE WHO'S ATTRACTING NO CROWDS ENTHUSIASM OR LOYALTY FROM PEOPLE WHO AS A MEMBER OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE LOVING HIM BY THE WAY IT SHOULD BE NOTED AT THIS POINTHAD OF ALL OF THE CABINET OFFICIALS WHO SERVED UNDER DONAL TRUMP A GRANTELL OF FOR HAVE CURRENTLY INDORSEHIM HE DIDN'T FIGHT AGAINS SELECTION FRAUD WHICH WILL NOW BE EASILY ABLE TO PROVE THEY SOME MOST RECENT FACONSITEMENT AND IN FORMATION WHICH WILL HAVE BE MADE A VAILABLE TO US FINALLY A REALLY BIG DEAL THE VP HAD POWER MI DIDN'T UNDERSTAND BUT AFTER THE ELECTION THE RINOS IN DEMS CHANGED LAW TAKING THAT POWER AWAY A DON TRUM TALKING ABOUT LOYAL TY WTH REGARD TO MY PENC IS REALLY PRETTY GRUVES THIS FALLS UNDER THE TWO THINGS CAN BE TROL ONCERAL DON TRUMP SHOULD BE INSITED THESE ARE NOT CRIMES THEY'RE JUST VERY VERY VERY BAD BEHAVIOR AND BAD ACTIVITY IT CAN ALSO BE TRUE THAT DON TRUMP ERELIED ON ADVISERS FOR SOME OF THE WORST ADVISERS IN AMERICAN HISTORY SIDNEY PAW IS A COUK SHE WAS A CUK THE WHOLE

NINE ELEVEN AND A PRETTY FORMIDABLE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TH BEGINING THE TWO THOUSAND AGHT RACE IN TO A MAN WHO APPEARS TO BE A HABITUAL DRUNK WHEN THERE'S IT THERE'S AN OUTLET OUT THAT THERE THERE

WHICH IS TONOMINATES ONL TRUMSE THAT CAN HIT HIM WITH EIGHTY THREE FALSE INDITEMENTS WIF HE NOW IN THE ELECTION LOCK HIM UP AND HIT HIM WITH A MEDIA WAVES SUGGESTING THAT HE IS A CRIMINAL AND DO YOU THINK THAT DON TRUMP IS CAN BE ABLE TO OVERCOME ALL OF THOSE OBSTACLES DO THING THAT'S THAT'S LIKELY IS THAT THE MOST PLAUSIBLE SOLUTION HERE OR IS A POSSIBLE THE BEST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN IS FOR JOBIDE NOT TO BE PRESIDENT ANY MORSE WE CAN FIX THE PROBLEMS SO CAN FIX THE PROBLEMS AND THIS BRINGS US TO THE OTHER CANDIDATES INSIDE THE REPUBLICAN RACE AGAIN RONDOSANTUS IS STILL THE SOLID NUMBER TO THERE IS NO NUMBER THREE ALL THE TALK ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE RISING INSIDE THE REPUBLICAN PULLING JUST IS NON EXISTENT ALL THE  THE E RIGHT NOW IF YOU WISH TO SEE SOME ONE ASIDE FROM DONAL TROM NOMINATED IT IS TO SANTIS OR BUST THE REAL CR POST EXPOLLING AVERAGE HAS TRUMP AT FIFTY FOUR AND HAS TO CANTIS DATEEN AND IS EVERY ONE ELSE BELOW FIVE PER CENT NO ONE ELSE IS GAINING STEAM NO ONELSE O PICKING UP TRACTION NOT TIM SCOT WHO STUCK AT THREE PER CENT NINT IF HE HAILEY WHO STUCK AT FOUR PER CENT NOT MY PENCS WHO STUCK AT FOUR PER CENT NOT TOE VE CROMASUAMMI WHO STUCK AT FIVE PERCENT AND CERTAINLY NOT THE THE INIMITABLY ABSOLUTELY MAGNETIC DUG BERGHAM WE'VE NEVER HEARD OF THE SO TE SANTIS IS FINAL LY DOING THE THING THAT HE NEEDS TO DO WHICH IS HE IS AGGRESSIVELY FINDING PEOPLE ON THE

DEBATE THAT REALLY THE COUNTRY SHOULD HAVE IS WHETHER WE WISH TO BE MORE LIKE FLORDA OR WHETHER WE WISH TO BE MORE LIKE CALIFORNIA HIAVE A PERSONAL STAKE IN THIS DEBATES AS I LITERALLY MOVE MY FAMILY FROM CALIFORNIA TO FLORDA AND MY COMPANY FROM CALIFORNIA TO FLORIDA AND NATIONAL SO THE I'M FASCINATED BY THIS I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE THE DEBATE THAT ACTUALLY IS WORTH WATCHING AS OPPOSED TO YU NOW TWO OLD MEN SCREAMING AT EACH OTHER ABOUT THEIR PERSONAL CORRUPTION OR A LEGED PERSONAL CORRUPTION THIS DEBATE SHOULD BE INTERESTING ACCORDING TO POLITICO THE FLOR REPUBLICAN IN CALIFORNY DEMOCRATE

SAID TOMY WHEN AND WERE IN EIGTS O NEWSOME TOLD POLITICO THE GOVERNOR WAS ALSO IN APPARENTLY THE PROPOSED DEBATE DATES ARE NOVEMBER EIGHTH OR NOVEMBER TEN AND A HANIDY WOULD BE THE SOLE MONITOR SO IT

JACK POT IN FINDING THE REGULATORY AN VIRE MAN ER COMPANY THAT CAN NAVIG GA RIGHT TO THE TA BUT IN OBVIOUSLY AS TIMES TOLD IN A BEING A LITTLE BIT TOO CLOSE THE SON AND E BURNING I AY SO I'M AT THIS POINT I THINK THAT WE CAN POINT OUT THAT THERE WILL BE A FALL BACK DEFENSE BECAUSE THE EFENCE THAT JOE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON IS OUT IS OBVIOUSLY LIE THAT THE IDEA THAT JOE'S NOT INVOLVES IN ANY WAY WITH HIS SONS BUSINESSES IS OBVIOUSLY LIE ALL ALLTHESE THINGS ARE CLEARLY LIES SO WORGANAN GETS THE FINAL THE FINAL DEFENCE HERS CAN BE JOE OF COURSE TER DID HE HAD TO HUNTER WAS DEARELECT HUNTER WAS A BEAUTIFUL BOY GOING THROUGH A ROUGH TIME A WONDERFUL ARTIST IN HIS SOUL WHO'S STUPPING HIS A BROTHER'S WIDOW AMONG OTHER WOMEN WELL DOING CRAC AND TRAFFICING AND ALL THAT A WONDERFUL AND AND JOE LOVES HIS BECAUSE HE LOVES FAMILY JOE'S A FAMILY MEN THERE'S ONE FINAL OBSTACLE T AT TO FEND TO AND THAT WAS THE FACT THAT HE WAS IGNORING A FOR YOR OLD GIRL WHO ACTUALLY IS GENETICALLY HIS GRANDDAUGHTER I'S A HU'S IGNORING HER AND NOW THEY'VE DECIDED THAT THE REAL REASON HE WAS IGNORING HER IS CAUSE HE LOVES HIS FAMILY TOO MUCH TOO MUCH THAT'S ALSO WHY YOU IGNOR MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMIL YOU LOVE THEM TOO MUCH ACCORDING TO ENVY SEY NEWS IN RECENT WEEKS PRESIDEN JO BIDON REALIZED HIS SILENCE WAS NO LONGER TENNABAL THAT IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO PUBLICALLY RECOGNIZED HIS FOR YER OLD GRANDDAUGHTER CAUGHT UP IN A BITTER CHILD SUPPORTCASES INVOLVING HIS SON HUNTER PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITHT MATTER SEID U BEFORE HE COULD DO SO HE WANTED TO TAKE ONE FINAL STEP GETTING THE GREEN LIGHT FROM HIS SON WHICH HE RECEIVED LAST WEEK ONE SOR SAID AND ON FRIDAY BIDON FINALLY SPOKE OUT ABOUT HIS SEVENTH GRANDCHIL TO HIM FOR YEARS HE WOULDN'T SO MUCH AS ACKNOWLEDGE IN PUBLIC NOW THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO MEET LITTLE MAVY JONE ROBERT'S OF ARKENTON AND TOSPELL THE NOTION THAT HE WAS IGNORING A VULNERABLE MEMBER OF THE BIDN FAMILY TREE TAT IS THAT THE ROOT OF HIS POLITICAL IDENTITY ACCORDING TOTHE PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITHT MATTER HE WANTS TO METHER YE WHEN LIKE UP HE'S IN A MEAT NAVY JONE A PROXIMATELY THE TIME THAT HE VISIEAS PALISTINE OHIO OR THE BORDER A THOSE THE THE SAME TREP PROBALY HE HE'SIN WHAT EAS PALESTINE VISIT THE TRAINED ARELMENT MEMBERY'S GAN DO THAT AND NEVER HABIT YET NAVY JONE CHE CHES TO ME A FREQUENT WHITE HOUSE GASED NEVER FAMILY DRAMAS TYPICALLY PLAY OUT IN PRIVATE THEG RARELY WHEN THE FIRST NATIONS FOR FAMILIES INVOLVED THE PRESIDENT WAS WRAPPED HIMSELF IN FAMILY THROUGHOUT HIS QUEER IS NOW IN AN IMPROBABLE TWIST HAVING TO EXPLAIN WHY HE PUBLICALY GHOESTED A YOUNG GIRL WHO AS AS MUCH AS GRANDCHILDS ANY OF THE OTHERS WHOSE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATIONS HE ATTENDS OR WHO PLAYFULLY CALL HIM POP PUBLICLY CLAIMING NAVY JONE IS A MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY MAY ALL FER BIDINA MEASURE OF PEACE POLITICALLY HOWEVER IT ALSO SERVES TO BLUNDS A JEOPI LINE OF A TAKNAT DOESN'T NOT DOESN'T IT'S OBVIOUS THAT HE WAS IGNORING HIS GRANDDAUGHTER BECAUSE HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THAT GRANDDAUGHTER AT IESN'T CAR ABOUT THE GRANDDAUGHTER BECAUSE HUNTER CLEARS THE CHECKS FOR HIM THE WHITE HOUSE TO CLINE TO COMMENT ON ANY OF THE FAMILY DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING WHETHER BIDON WANTS TO MET HIS GRANDDAUGHTER IN PERSON INSTEAD A WHITE HOUSE HA'D REFERRED THE TO FRIDAY STATEMENT A CALLED THE ISSUE A PRIVATE FAMILY MATTER THAT'S WEERD THAT'S PRIVATE FAMILY MATTER I GAN I LOVE THAT THE'RE OW CLAIMING PRIVACY NO ONE KNOWS ANY OF BIDONS OTHER GRAND CHILDREN OTHER THAN NAVY JONES SPECIFICALLY BECAUE HE DOESN'T IGNORE ANG OF IS OTHER GRAND CHILDREN SO ITS NOT A STORY JOBIDON IS A BAD MAN THE VERY VULNERABLE CANDIDATE REPUBLICANS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RUN AGAINST THAT VULNERABLE CANSIDETE AN IT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE BECAUSE I AM NOT SOLD ON THE IDEA THAT THE ECONOMY IS IN SOLID STATE I KNOW THAT EVERYBODY IN THE MEDIA ARE ALREADY TURNING EAGERLY SO THE IDEA THAT THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO BE  JUST FONG AND THERE WILL BE NO RECESSION I HAVE SOME DOUBTS IVE THAT YOU KNOW WHWELLSE HAS DOUBTS AS IT TURNS OUT THE FITCH CREDIT RATING SERVICE SO REMEMBER BY NOMICS IT'S SO AMAZING BY NOMIC BY NOMIC MEANS THAT DONE FITCH RATINGS IS NOW DOWN GRATED THE US GOVERNMENTS CREDIT RATING WEEKS AFTER PRESIDENT BIDON AND CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS CAME TO THE BRINK OF THE HISTORIC DEFALL WARNING ABOUT THE GROWING DEBTBURDEN AND POLITICAL DISFUNCTION IN WASHINGTON WELL YOU KNOW ONE WAY TO SOLVE THE DET BURNON IS TO IS TO STOP SPENDING SEVEN TRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR BUT THE BIDE WITE HAS LING NOW FITCH JUST GOT A WRONG THAT'S PROBLY WHAT IT IS FITCH GOT A WRONG NOW OU MIND YOU THAT WHEN MOODY'S DOWN GRATED ISRAEL'S CREDITE LIKE A FEW WEEKS AGO IN THE AFTRMATH OF JUDICIAL REFORM IN ISRAEL THE ENTIRE MEDIA SIHTED THIS IS EVIDENCE THAT ISRAEL'S ECONOMYESABOUT THE COLLAPSE IT AS NOT YET COLLAPSED WHEN FITCH DOWNGRATES AMERICAS CREDIT RATING BECAUSE WE ARE SPENDING WLYCHTO MUCH MONEY AND WE WILL NEVER CATCH UP THEN IT MUST BE THAT FITCH IS WRONG HERE'S JARD BURNSTEEN ON THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL THE CONOMIC ADVISERS WHEN PTURBO ERA  TA ATORD CELA DO YOU ARARATION TOAAAOAAN A A TEREAARAAER FAO I YOU REA OOOA AOERAN STANOOAR PEOPLAAO R TRAN TEO O ANO AR BEDAR FOR MA  WELL THER THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM OF THIS WHICH IS THAT AMERICA OWES WA WE WA TO MUCH MONEY AND THAT IS JUST A REALITY AND NOBODY IS GOING TO TAKE THIS ON AT ALL THE FACT IS AGAIN BECAUSE WE HAVE JACK TOP OUR INTERESTRATES THAT MEANS THAT THE INTEREST PAYMENTE THAT WE ARE TAKING ON OUR NEW DEBT IS GOING TO BE EXTRAORDINARILY HON THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WERE GAN HAVE TO DEDICATE TO PAYING OFF OLIV OUR CREDITORS FOR DECADES TO COM IS EXTRAORDINARY NET INTEREST IS GOING TO REACH SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR FISCAL YEAR THAT IT'S THREE QUARTERS OF ALL DISCRETIONARY SPENDING EXCLUDING DEFENSE IN THE UNITED STATES THAT JUST THE INTEREST ON OUR DEBT AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET LARGER AGAIN THE FACT IS THAT AS A SHARE OF G D P THE PROJECTION OF YOUUST THAT IS A SHARE OF GROWS DOMESTICCRODICT CONTINUES TO RISE ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHINGLY AND DRAMATICALLY WHICH IS ONE REASON WHY YOU ARE STRING TO SEE CREDIT DOWNGRATESTHAT'S CON CONTINUES SO LONG AS THE PROGRAMM OF THE UNITED STATES IS TO SPEND MORE AND MORE AND MORE MONEY TH BID ADMINISTRATION THEIR PLAN IS DENIAL AN SO THE STRATEGY OF THE BIND ADMINISTRATION IS TO PRETEND THAT YOU KNOW THAT DOESN'T MATTER AS ALWAYS SO GANIT YELLING PROUD FEAT SHEA SHE SAYS THAT DONE IT'S PUZZLING TO GET THIS CREDIT DOWN GRATE ANTA THIS ADMINISTRATION DEEPLY CARES ABOUT FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY WHICH IS A STRANGE BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO CARE BYT FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY DON'T SPEND SEVEN TRILLIAN DOLLARS THE YEAR THE LONKERTERM THE UNITED STATREMAINSTHE WORLDS LARGEST MOST TINAMIC AN MOST INIFATIV ECONOMY WITH HI STRONGESFINANTIAL SISTEM IN THE WORLD IT JIS DISICION IS PISTLING AN LIHTEDTHE ECONOMIC STRENTH WIT SY IN THE UNITED STATES I STRONGLY DISECRE WITH FITIOSTISITION AND I BELIEF ID ISENTIRELY UNWARRANTED FISCAL RESPONABILITYIS PRIORITY FOR PRISED INBIDON IN ME EARLIER THIS YEAR THE PRISED INSEING DET LIMIT LEGISLATION THEINCLUDED ORITRILION DOLLARS IN DEFICET REDUCTION IS POICER WOULD ALSO INPRUVETISCAL OUTLOOK BY REDUSING DEFISE BY TO POINSIXTRILION DOLLARS OFIE NEXTEN YEARS O'M YAT RIGHT THE'RE GONG TO REDUCE THE DEFTSIT GUYS BY THAT BY BY THAT THEY MEAN THAT THEY ARE GOING TO SUPPOSEDLY SPEND LESS MONY OVER WHAT WE ACTUALLY ARE PAYING THEN THEY DID PREVIOUSLY NOT THERE CAN REDUCE DAT THAT THAT'S NOT A THING THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN BY THE WAY THE THE ECONOMY'S STILL ON TENDER HOOKS HERE BECAUSE AS THE WALSTERGUNAL POINTS OUT EARNINGS SEASON IS STILL COMING WE'RE GON TO FIND OUT NOR HOW THE EARNINGS OF THESE COMPANIES ARE ON TO DO AND WILL E HW THAT AM PASS THE STOK MARKET WHILE STOCKS OF CLIMB CORFERT PROFITS O FALLEN ACCORDING TO WALSTER JOUNAL COMPANYES IN THE ASCIPY FIVE HUNDRED ARE SET TO LOG AT ROUGHLY SEVEN PER CENT YEAR OVOR YOUARS ECLINE IN EARNINGS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER WHICH AGAIN IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW THESE STOCK MARKET KEEPS INCREASING WHILE EARNINGS ARE GOING DOWN WE ARE ALSO GOING TO SEE THE JOBS MARKET THAT IS COOLING PRETTY RAPIDLY YOUMUST EMPLOYERS ADDED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAN CJOBSIN JUNE THATIS THE SMALLST MONTHLY PAYRILL GAIN SINCE LATE TWENTY TWENTY THE JULIAN PLENMET REPORT IS COMING OUT THIS FRIDAY WAGE GROWTH HAS SLOWED AS WELL AND WE ARE SEEING YOUR IN YOUR JOB OPENING SO AGAIN WHAT WHAT GOES UP MUST COME DOWN THE ECONOMY WENT UP WADE TOO FAST AN TRMS OF JUST THE HEAT AND I IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN A I I I HAVE VERY LITTLE FAITH THAT THE BIDE EMINISTRATION HAS SOMEHOW AVOIDED THE PITFALLS OF REALITY O KAY TIME FOR A QUICK THING I LIKE AND THEN WE'LL DO A FEW THINGS THAT I HATE SO THINGS AT THAT I LIKE TO DAY I ENJOY WHEN PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE LEVERAGE SOMETIMES BELIEVE THEY HAVE LEVERAGE IT'S KIND OF FUNNY SO FOR EXAMPLE RACHEL'S IGLER ISN'T ACTRESS NOW THERE ARE MANY MANY MANY ACTRESSES LIKE EVERY BERESTOT IN IN LOST ANGELISTS ISN'T ACTRESS RACHEL'S IGLER IS AN ACTRESS WHO IS ON BROADWAY THERE ARE MANY MANY MANY PEOPLE WHO TRA FOR BROADWAY AND WHEARE QUITE TALENTED IT TURNS OUT IN COUNTRY THREE OR FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THAT RE LOT OF TALENTED PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTORS ACTRESSES SINGERS BUT RACHEL'S IGLER BELIEVES THAT CHE HAS LEVERAGE OUVEN THOU AGAIN NO ONE TRUTHLLY IN HOLLYWOOD NO ONE HAS THE CAPACITY TO OPEN A MOVE ANY MORE IDOES NO ONE DOES THEN THE NUMBER OF STARS WERE CAN OPEN A MOVI IN AMERICA THAT IS DOWN TO BASICALLY CRISSPRAT NO ONE O BUT TOM CRUWS CRISPRAT THAT'S THE ENTIRELESS YOU KNOWS NOT ON THALIST AS RACHEL'S GGLER RECHELL'S UGGLER HOWEVERIS PART OFTHE ACTER STRIKE AND SHE SAYS THAT DOM BECAUGHT SHE SHE ESSENTIALLY PROMOTES THE LABOR THURY OF VALUE WHEN IT COMES TO ACTING HERE A YA THIS IS THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE HOW THIS THIS LABOR STRIKE GAT SOLVED O A A  OU    I OT A A A      W AT R O  IH WELL THE YOU COAN NEGOSHA THAN YOUR CONTRACT BUT DIT YOU'RE NOT I NOTICED SO WHAT SHE SAYING THERE IS THAT BECAUSE SHE IS STANDING THERE I DISTNEY DRESS SHE SHOULD GET PAID FOR EVERY HOUR THAT SNO WHITE AND THE NON WETHAT LET TENA SNO WHITE AND THE NON DWARF DWARFS O VARIOUS DIVERS BACKGROUNDS IN SEXTUAL LRANTATIONS FOR EVERY HOUR THAT'S THAT IMN THE BADNESS FOR HERS TAT'S CON TO GET STREAMED LIKE FOR TWO HOURS SO IT'S NOT IT'S TON CAN BE AMAZING BUT EVEN PUT THAT ASIDE THAT IS NOT HOW MARKET'S WAR THAY DID SHE TAKE THE ACTUAL RISK IS SHE IN PUTTING THE CAPITAL INTO THE MAKING OF THAT FILM ERE EU SHE GETTING PAID A SALARY IN ORDER TO DO THAT FILM A PRETTY LUCRATIVE SALARY I WOULD IMAGIN SHE COULDN NEGOTIATE FOR A POINT RIGHT THERE THER ACTRES WHAVE DONE THAT PAST GON VERY RICH DOING THAT DU SHE HAVE THE MARKET POWER TO DO THAT THE ANSWERS OF COURSE NOTHINGS O GO DOWN THESTREET AN AND HIRE SOMEBODY ELSE SO A  GOOD LUCK TO HER IN HER IN HER LEVERAGE PLAY THAT'S NOT HOW BUSINESS WORK SO CA TIME FOR A COUPLE OF THINGS AT THAT I HATE SO THERE'S SOME PEOPLE TODAY WHO ARE LAUGHING AND CELEBRATING AT THE SEPARATION  BETWEEN  JUST INTRUDO AND HIS WIFE FIRST ALI DONO KNOW THAT YOU WAS MARRIED TO LADY BUT IN ANY CASE JUST IN TRUDO THAT'S BABLONBYJOE BY THE WASO CREDITS OF BABLIM IN

ON THEIR RESPECTIVE INSTROGRAM ACCOUNTS WHICH WAS THEWAY THE MOST HONORABLE PEOPLE DO THIS THING WHEN YOU HAVE THREE KIDS S YOU GOD YOUR INSTROGRAM ACCOUNTS AND THN YOU LET THE WORLD KNOW THA YOUON'T LIKE EACH OTHER ANY MORE SOPHY AND I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE THE FACT THAFTER MANY MEANINGFUL AND DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS WE'VE MADE THE DECISION TO SEPARATE JUSTINTRUDO SAID ON INSTROGRAM THEN THEY BOTH

HOUD CAN ANSWER TANEM EN CORRESPONDENT IN CABEC SHE SAID IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN I CAN TEL YOU READWAY NO ARRIAGE IS EASY I'M ALMOST KIND OF PROUD OF THE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD HARDSHIP BECAUSE WE WANT AFF ENTICITY WE WANT TRUTH I THTHE REASON I PUT THE SOME THINGS I HATE IS BECAUSE AGAIN THE BEKIND OF NO ONE SHOULDEVER REVEL IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S DIVORC WHEN THER KIDS BECAUSE IT'S SCREWS UP KIDS INCREDIBLY BADLY THE KIND OF SOFT PEDDLING OF THE EFFECTS OF DIVORCE ON CHILDREN IN OUR SOCIETY IS ASTONISHING AND WHAT'S AMAZING IS THAT IT'S BECOME SO WROTE IF YOU' BA TO LIKE THE THE LATE NINETEEN

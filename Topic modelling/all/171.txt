WHAT' TO WHAT TO MAZE ABOUT THIS THE SPECIAL COUNCIL NOW HAS INDEPENDENCE YOU MEAN NOW HE DOES NOT UN UNDERSTAND WHY DIDN'T HE HAVE IT BEFORE THAT WOULDHAVE BEEN THE QUESTION WOULD IT NOT WHAT ADTED AUTHORITY DOESN'T GIVE TO WISES IN WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR HOTT ABOT IT HIMSELF THE PRIMARY ADDED AUTHORITY IS REALLY INDEPENDENCE THE SPECIAL COUNCIL NO LONGER WILL HAVE TO BE A WE OVER BY TE BY THE AT TORNEY GENERAL THE TECHNICALLY SPECIAL COUNCILL DOES HAVE TO REPORT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL I AD ENAL WAY ATTORNEY GENERALD OR HE INDICATED THAT DAVID WIST AD  ROUT INVEST TO GET TORY POWER SO THE REAL QUESTION THIS WHAT INPRENCE CAN WE DRAW FROM DAVID WISE'S REQUEST A TO BECOME SPECIAL COUNT AN MEAN THE INFERENCE IS THAT HE WANTS TO COVER UP WHAT IS GOING ON CLEARLY CLEARLY IN TO MAYS EVEN SAN AN CHAKETAPPER NOW LISEN I THINK JAKE  OBVIOUSLY IS A LEFT LEANING EYE BUT HE LEAST ATTEMPTS TO BE OBJECTED IN HIS ANALYSIS IT SOMETIMES SO JAKE AND AS SOME OF THE OTHERS UNSEEN AND ACTUALLY QUESTION THE SPECIAL COUNCIL OFPPLAYTMENT RIGHTLY SO YHE ES ATTORNEY HAD MADE THE DECISION TO HAVE IT DISBEA DIVERSION PROGRAM IN A MIS DEMEANOR I BUT NOW IT MERITS O SPECIAL COUNCIL SO T AT DOES HE KNOW OF STUFF THAT SHOULD BE IN A SPECIAL COUNCIL INVESTIGATION THAT WASN'T IN THAT PLEADALI MA MAYBE HE DOES BUT THEN WHY DO THAT PLEAD THE IT'S ALL RIGHT IT'S ALL VERY SESPECIAL FASTIN REMEMBER WE'VE HEARD ALREADY FROM DAVID WISE ABOUT WHAT THE PROCESS WAS LIKE HE HAS SAID I HAVE THE AUTHORITY DO SO ALL THE TOTIN PAINTS AR CRONTRAYE TO AF MY EXPERIENCE WAS BUT NOW THIS RAISE THE LOT OF QUESTIONS WHEREVER HAPPEN ON TUESDAYS A PAUS ALLUDING TO NOW DOES MAKE ME FEEL SURPRISED ABOUT WHY NOW WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE REMEMBER HE IS STILL THE BEST TORNEY IN DELAWARE BUT NOW THE SPECIAL COUNCIL ALLOWS HIM TO ACTUA TO GO BEYOND HIS OWN JURISTICTION YOU CAN LOOK AT EITHER AREAS AS WELL THREESON YOU HAVE JACK SMAT NOT HAPPING TO CONFINED TO ONE PARTICULAR JURISITCAN GO BEYOND THAAN HAPTINGS IN FOUGTAN FLORITY AND HAPPINGS AN WASHINGTON DO SEE IT DOES NOW GO BEYOND THAT BUT AT ITS CORE I WONDER WHAT THE DECISION REALLY CAME DOWN TO THE SPECIAL COUNCIL STATUTE SAYSE YOU CAN HAVE THIS IF YOU FIRST LOOK TO THINKER OUT DOES A MATTER ACTUALLY WARRANT AND INVESTIGATION IS IT WARRANTED HE HAD CONCLUDED IT DID AT YOUR GARLMAND WH AS THERE A COMPLICTAT INTEREST TATD PLAY HERE I MEAN IT IS PRETTY MASON WHEN EVEN SEANAN IS LIKE GUIDES THIS IS THIIS PRETTYWEARD MEANWHILE HUNTER BIDON'S ATTORNEY ABBY LOELL WAS ASKED POINT BLANK IF  HUNTERBIDONS FORM BUSINESS DEALINGS WOULDN'T ANYWAY CONNECT BACK YOU JOBIDON LISTEN TO THE WIRLY LANGUAGE OR FRMABULOL BUT CAN YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER ARE NOT YOUR FROM WHAT YOU KNOW IF YOURE CONFIDENT THAT THIS WONT AN ANYWAY LINK BACK TO THE PRESIDENT WHAT I KNOW AS WHAT THE EVIDENCE HAS REVEALED I MEAN THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD FOCUS ON IT'S NOT AS IF THE STARTED YESTERDAY OR A WEEK IT STARTED FOR FIVE YEARS WITH SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING WITH THE POWER OF SEPIANIS AS MISTER WEISS HAS HAD TO LOOK AT EVERY TRANSACTION THAT HUNTER WAS ENGAGED IN IN ANY PLACE IN THE WORLD IN WHICH HE WAS ENGAGED AND WHAT DID THEY COME UP WITH THEY CAME UP WITH THE DECISION THAT THE ONLY TWO CHARGES TO FILE WERE TWO MISDEMEANORS AT A GUN DIVERTED CHARGE NOT ANY OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT THE MAGOR RIGHT WING HAVE BEEN YELLING FROM MONEY LAUNDERING TO FAREIGN CORRUPTION TO FAREIGN AGENT NONE OF THAT YOU NOTICE WHAT THAT WASN'T THAT WASN'T A FULL SCALE FULL FRONTAL DENIAL OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JO AND HUNTER'S BUSINESS YOU NOTICE THAT WASN'T WAT THEY WAS AID THERE WON'T BE ANY EVIDENCE THAT'S UNCUPBOARD I KNOW THE EVIDENCE IS UNCOVERED THAT THUS FAR BUT WHERE IS THE WHERE IS THE FULL THROATED JOE AND HUNTER WERE NOT IN BUSINESS TOGETHER IN ANY WAY SHI PERFORM NO MONEY THAT HUNTER EVER TOOK IN FROM A FOREIGN SORSE WAS USED TO JOE'S BENEFIT NOR WAS HUNTER BIDON EVER ASSOCIATING JOE WITH THE BUSINESS OF HIS FOREIGN BUSINESSES NONE OF THAT LIKE NONE OF IT THERE IS THE NONE OF IT IN THAT PARTICULAR STATEMENT INSTEAD THERE JISCONT O PLAY VICTIM IN FACT YORE IS TABBY LOELL SAYING THEREBEN CONCER ANNOUNCE THAT TROM FORCES COULD INFLUENCE THEINVESTED HOW COULD TROM FORCES INFLUENCE THE INVESTIGATION ITS JOE BIDON'S DEO JAY HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN IN THE ANSWER IS  NOW THERE AFRAID THAT THEY GOT CALE WIT

MOMENT THIS ARRANGEMENT AND AGREEMENT HAS BEEN ANNOUNCE AND FILED YOU HAVE EVERY MAGA RIGHT WING FANATICAL PERSON YELLING AND SCREAMING AND SAYING IT'S NOT RIGHT AND IT'S NOT FAIR AND IT'S NOT JUST YOU HAVE THE FORMER PRESIDENT TRYING TO USE HUNTER BIDON AS A WAY TO EXCUSE HIS OWN CONDUCT TAT AT SOME POINT THAT COULD PIERCE THE NOISE COULD ACTUALLY BE SO NOISY THAT IT GET IN THE WAY OF THE FACTS IN THE LAW WELL WOULDN'T THAT BE A TRAGEDY WOULN THAT BE A TRAGEDY IF IT TURNS OUT THAT DOME T THE GIANT PUBLE YOU'VE CREATED WITH THE HELP OF JOBIDON'S DOJE ACTUALLY STARTED TO CAVE IN IF SOME MANSHOUL POP THAT BUBBLE WHAT A TRAGEDY DAUOUD ME CAN WOELD GET IN JUST ONE SECOND TO PRESIDEENT TRUMP WHOSE RESPONDING TO ALL OF THIS FIRST THE MENSHIP YERE A SHOS SUPPORTED BY GRAND CANDON

DAVID WICE I HE PUT OUT A VERY WEIRD STATEMEN ACTRIES AI DAVID WICE WAS PICKED BY THE TWO DEMOCRAT SENTERS FROM DELAWARE UNDER BLUE SLIP HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PICKED BY ME BUT I HAVE A GREAT IDEA WHY DON'T THEY USED ARANGED  JACK SMITH HE THEN CONTINUED WICE HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING HUNTR FOR FOUR YEARS GIVING HIM THE SWEETHEART DEAL OF ALL SWEET HAR DEALS BUT A BRILLIAN TRUDGEAN DELAWARE SAW THROUGH IT ALL NOW I READ THE GEOJE WANTE O NEW JODGE IN JURISDICTION BUT SO TO I WITH FAR STRONGER REASONS THAN HUNTER AND CROOKED JO MAGA WELL ACTUALLY TRUMP FORMALLY NOMINATED WISE FOR U S ATTORNEY FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE AND I WISE WAS SWORN IN WHILE TRUMP WAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SO OM THAT'S NOT LIKE THE BEST STATEMENT FROM TRUM BUTT SUFFICED IT TO SAY THAT HE IS OBVIOUSLY CORRECT THAT WISE IS A STUGE ON BEHALF OF THE D O J AT THIS POINT THAT ALL INDICATOR'S POINT TO THAT AND THE FACT THAT E'S NOW BASICALLY ESCAPED ANY SORT OF CONGRESSIONAL SCRUTINIY BY BEING A POINTS OF SPECIAL COUNCIL IS PRETTY OBVIOUS CORRUPTION WELL MEANWHILE PRESIDENT TRUMPS PRESIDENTIAL RUN CONTINUES HEIS FASING DOWN PRESUMABLY  SOME SORT OF INDICTMENT THAT IS GOING TO COME DOWN EITHER THIS WEEK OR NEXT WEEK ACCORDING TO THE WALLSTR GERAL GEORGE S OECOME GROUND ZERO FOR EXHAUSTION OVER THE LEGAL DRAMA SURROUNDING TONNEL TRUMP AND THE GEO P DEBATE OF WHETHER TO STICK WITH HIM IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR GEORGIA THERE ARE STILL SIGNS THAT VOTERS OF TIRED OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION REEPLACE AND OF TRUMP HIMSELF THAT KIND OF TRUMP FATIGUE IS PERVASIVE IN GEORGIA ACCORDING TO REPUBLICAN STRATAJUST WHICH S THE SERIOUS PROM FOR HIM IN GENERAL ELECTION BRIGHT NOW THE POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER INDICTMENT LOOMING IS PRETTY OBVIOUS PRESIDEN TRUMP BPUT OUT OF STATEMENT OVER TH WE GAN GOING AFTER THE FULTON COUNTY D A FANNY WILLIS HA HE WENT AFTER PRETTY HARD OBVIOUSLY HE SUGGESTED THAT OM SH IS CORRUPT HE SUGGESTED THAT SH IS A DRIVEN BY POLITICS OF COURSE SH SH IS SHIS A PARTISAN DEMOCRAT  BUT YOW AS THESE CASE IS STACK OB IT IS GOING TO PROVIDE A SERIOUS CHALLENGE TO HIS ABILITY TO ACTIVELY RUN A CAMPAIGN ACCORDING TO BRIGHT BART DA COM FANNY WILLS HAS PLAYING TO BRING MULTIPLE WITNESSS BEFOREGRANJURY NEXT SWEEK AS PART FOR INVESTIGATION INTO PRESIDENT TRUMP TRUM GROTE I HEAR THAT RASIS TO FULTON COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY FONY FATIN FANNY WILLIS WHO WEEKLY PRESIDES OF ONE OF THE DEADLIEST COMMUNITIES IN THE UNITED STATES WITH THOUSANDS OF MURDERS VIOLENT CRIMINALS AND GANGMUMERS ROMING THE STREET TU LONG ON TRIED FREE AND OURE TREE WITH KINGLUBS HIS USING A POTENTIAL INDICTMENT OF ME AND OTHER INSTANT PEOPLE AS A CAMPAIGN AND CON AND FUNRASIN CON JOB ALL BASE ON A PERFECT PHONE CALL IS PRESIDENT CHALLENGING ELECTION FRAUD MY DUTY AND RIGHT THIS WOUD BE TRUMPS FOURTH INDICTMENT IN T PAST A FIVE MONTHS AND OF COURSE IT WOULD BLEED INTO THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION TRUMP WAS ASKED WHETHER HE BE TAKEN A PLEDIAL IN GEORGU AND CORRECTLY HE SAID A NO WAY MAN NOT A THNG THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN I ER ANY TINEI EEI IA  A I  AI I EE I I II   A A I II  I E I I EA I   AI  A I   I I A A  I  A E AI A  I IA  II AN I E I II E  A AEII I EII A POUND HE SO THAT OF COURSE GAN BE TRUMPSLINE AL THE WY THROUGH THE ELECTION THE QUESTION IS WETHER THAT IS GOING TO BE A WINNING MESSAGE IN A'T GENERAL LECTION AT SOMETHING THAT REPUBLICAN VOTERS GANG A HALF TO DASIDE A TIE WHEN SOME FRIENDS OVER THE WEEKAND AND WE ARE ALL AGREEING THAT THE REASON THAT REPUBLICANS MANY OF THEM LOVE LOVE LOVE TRUMP IS BECAUSE OF COURSE HE IS A HAND GRENADE THAT WAS THROWN INTO THESE SORT OF TEN OF VIPERS THAT IS AMERICAN POLITICS BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENS IF THAT HAND GRENADE BECOMES TO DODGE OR WHAT HAPPENS IS STARTS TO BLO UP IN YOUR HAND THAT SOMETHING REPUBLICANS ARE GING TO HALFE TO DECIDE TO THEY THINK THAT TRUMP IS STILL MORE OF A TOOL AGAINST THE LEFT THAT HE IS CAPABLE OF VICTORY IN A GENERAL ELECTION OR IS HE A HAN GRENADE THAT IS GOING TO BLOW UP IN THEIR HAND RIGHT NOW THE POLE SUGGEST THE REPUBLICANS ARE VERY MUCH ON BOARD WITH THE IDEA THAT TRUMP IS STILL THE BEST GY TWO NOMINATE THE REAL CLAPOLT EX PULLING AVERAGE HAS TRUMP WROUGHT RIDING VERY HIGH AT FIFTY FOUR PER CENT HAS RONDO SANTIS AT FIFTEEN PER CENT HAS E VACROMASUAMY AT SIX PENCE AT FIVE HAILY AT THEREE EVERYONE BELOW THAT NOW THE PULLING ON ROMASUAMMY IS VERY WEIRD AS I SAYEFUL DISCLOSURE I'M I'M FRENDLY WITH THE VAKE FOR SOME FRIENDLY WITH MANY OF THESE CAN THAT IT'S IS THE TRUTH BUT THE VAKES PULLING IS SUPERWEIRD BECAUSE ALL OF THE ONLINE POLES HAVE HIM AT SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN ELEVEN AND ALL O THE PHONE POLES HAVE MENT TO WHICH WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE THESE THESE MAY NOT BE THE MOST RELIABLE PULLING STITISTICS FOUR THE VAKE BECAUSE HE'S THE ONLY ONE HE ARE SEEING PICKING UP SUPPORT RIGHT NOW OTHER THAN TRUMP TRUMP IS ACTURALLY ON A BIT OF A HIE RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF HIS PULLING NUMBERS THE SANTIS HAS DECLININ THE REAL CROPOLITICS PULLING AVERAGE AABOUT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT IN APRIL OTHLY DOWNST ABOUT FIFTEEN PER CENT TO DAY THE VAG IN TH ROL CLOPOLITIX PULLING AVERAGE HAS FICKED UP ABOUT THREE POINTS IT BUT IT'S REALLY TRUMP WHOS SWORD DURING THAT SAME PERIOD TRUMP WONE FROM ABOUT FORTY FIVE PER CENT IN NO IN THE BEANING OF APRIL TWO FIFTY FOUR PER CENT TO DAY WELL THAT DINAMIC WAS CLEARLY ON DISPLAY IN IBE OVER THE WEEKEND IT WAS THE I WAS STAYED FAIR WHICH THIS GIAN HUGE FAIRE THAT HAPPENS AT EVERY FOUR YEARS IN IWA I BELIEVE IT HAPENS EVERY YEAR NIG OBIT E REALLY YOU BREAKS INTO THE OPEN DURING PRIMARY SEASON BECAUSE EVERYBODY GOES THERE HOPING TO WIN VOTES IN THE IWA CAUCASIS RIGHT NOW THE PULLING AND I WAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY NARROWER THAN THE PULLING NATIONALLY THE PULLING AND IWA SHOWS THAT DONAL TRUMP IS STILL FOR SHORE IN THE LEAD BUT HIS LEAD OVER OVER THE SANTIS IS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER THE LAST NEW YOR TIME SANTAPOLE HAT TRUMPET FORTY FOUR AND SANTIS AT TWENTY WHICH OF COURSE IS STILL A BIG GAP ITS TWENTY FOUR POINT GAP UT THAT TWENTY FOUR POINT GAPIS IS NOT OF FORTY POINT GOUT SAY THAT IS A A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WELL TO SANTUS SHOWED UP AND I INTED IN INTERVIEW WITH I WAS GOVERNOR IT CAN RENALD TO US TO SHUT UP AT THE EYEA STATE FAIR AND THAY HERES WITH THE SANTO SAD TO SAY I BELIEVE IF YOU AVE AN OPPORTUNITY A TO DO GOOD THINGS FOR YOUR COMMUNITY OR YOUR COUNTRY A THAT YOU EVE THAT YOU EVER RESPOTSABILITY TO DO THAT AN TO GET THAT DON AND SO THAT'S REALLY I THINK YOU DO I INFLUENCE TO ME ALL THE WAY UP TO THE PRESIDENT AND TERMS OF WHAT IM LOOKING TO DO LIKE WITH RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT I'M NOT RUNNING TO BE SOMEBODY IM RUNNING TO DO THINGS ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTRYIN FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AY SO NOW OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT'S AN ICELINE BUTHE BIG PROBIM FOR TO SANTUS IS THAT IN TERMS OF WHO IS A MORE EXCITING CANDIDATE WHO'S THE ONE WHO IS GOING TO SUCK ALL THE AIR OF THE ROOM THERE'S NO QUESTION THE TRUMP IS A MUCH MORE EXCITING CANDIDATE ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON POST THE CROWD THAT AD CRANE TO WASH GOVERNOR TO SANSUS FLIPP PORT TROPS WITH I WAS GOVERNOR SUDDENLY LOOKED TOWARD THE SKYTON TRIN  TRUMPS PLAN WAS ARRIVING THEY CLAPPED IN SHEER WE LOVE TRUMP SOME OF HEM HAD CHANCEED EARLIER WHEN TRUMP GOT TO THE PORTTENT MIDDAY WITH THE SANSIS CAMP FARAWAY RESTING IN THE SHATE HE DIDN'T PARTAKING THE ACTUAL GRILLING HE BROUGHT AN ONTRAGE OF SUPPORT OF LAW MAKERS FROM THE SANSUS HOME STATE THEY POSED FOR SELF ESAN PASSED OUT MAGAHATS TO A CROWD THE CLOG THE FAIRS GRAN AT CONCORS TRUMP WAS GON BEFORE TWO PN SO BAC COLD ACTUALLY THAT THAT KIND F BEHAVIOR COULD THEORETICALLY HARM TRUM IN IWA CAUCUS REMEMBER HE DIDN'T WHEN THE IOCAUCASIS THE FIRST TIME ROUND IT WAS ACTUALLY TED CREWS WHO ON THE IWACAWCIS TRUMP THEN DID WHAT HE HAS BECOME FAMOUS FOR DOING HE DENIED THE TED CREWS HAD WON THE IWA CAUCAS HE SUGGESTED THE TED CRUWS HAD STOLEN IT FRUM BEN CARSON THE BEN CARSON HAD DROPPED OUT AND AND AND THAT HE NOT FORMELLY DROPPED OUT A TE RUS TELLING PEOPLE HE HAD DROPPED OUT THAT MEANT THAT HE PICKED UP TBEN CARSON'S VOTES AND THE SHOUL HAVE GOING TO TRUMP AN REALLY TRUMP ONE EYEA AND ALL OF THE REST SO TRUM NOW THEORETICALLY COULD LOOSE IWAP AGAN BAT AN HERE IS THE FOOTIAGE OF TRUMPS PLANE ARRIVING AND AGAIN THERE IS THAN THE THE MAN DOES HAVE A A POLITICAL MAGIC TO HIM AND TRM TO REAL TO RETELL POLITICS HE ISTTU THERE IS A E TRUMP PLANE HI  BE LIKE AMONRON  NOW WHAT IT WOULDN'T ALL THIS MEAN WELL IT ACTUALLY TURNED INTO A BIT AF A A BIT OF A BRAWL A BUNCH OF TRUMP FANS WHO ERE BEING EXTRORDINARILY RUDE WHICH AGAIN NOT SUPER SHOCKING WE SAW SOME THIS BEHAVIOR IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION AS WELL THE SHAR TRYING TO DROWN OUT THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN KIMERENALDS AND RON TO SANTUS A I GOT A SAY LIKE FOR LOT OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS IF THEY LOOK AT THIS THEY HAVE TO WONDERS THIS THE SORT OF BEHAVIOR THAT ACTUALLY IS GOING TO WIN IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO APPEAL TO ANY PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING O BE SWING BOTERS OR SUBURBAN MOMS IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THAN WE HERE WAS AT KIMERENALDS FORSS TRUMP FANS THE RON TH OUT THERE I DOIN A NINTY NINE CANTY TOERE I THINK YOU MAY BE HAD OF ME HAN YOU KNOW WHAT A YOU KNOW WHT WHERE NO WHAT ANI NT WR  WAN NA SO LET GETBEPERY BEDYAPPERTEDITY HERE AR CAD ESO Y THAT THE QUESTION IS TO WHETHER THAT IS GOING TO BE AN APPEAL IS IS AN OPEN ONE FOR HIS PART TE SANTIS WENT AFTER TRUMP BECAUSE TRUMP HAD BEEN GOING AFTER REYNOLDS SO HE'S CAM PANNING WELL IN IWA ME NACTURALLY THE E SANS ESTEEM SEEMS FAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT THE'RE OING TO WIN IWA THE TRUTH IS THAT IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES THE SANTIS DOESN'T JUST NEEN TO WIN IYWA HE US WHI IWAT AND NEW HAMPSHIRE NUS WOEN BOTH OF THOSE IF HE LOSES NEW HAMPSTER AFTER WINNING IWA THEN TRUMP IS PROBABLY GOING TO WIN IN SOUTH CAROLINA HE REALLY NEEDS TO START CONSOLIDATING THE FEEL VERY VERY EARLY IN THIS RACE BUT HEIS DOING THE HARD ON THE GROUND WORK THE SLOGGING WORK THAT IS NECESSARY HERE'S TE SANSIS GOING AFTER TRUMP FOR ATTACKING REYNOLDS NOTEER YOURE RN O A NOTHER RE ALLER ROBBI O HR YOIN OE RAN A R ER   A A NO  I  A A A  A A A A A A R TER NWA O A A AA R EAN AR AN  AN  A IN A YOUA R   AR  A A A A A A A A AR E A N A AER THAN A AGRA THEY MEANT OBVIOUSLY DISENS HIS RIGHT ABOUT ALL THIS BUT THIS IS REALLY ONE OFTHE QUESTIONS I AGAIN TO GO BACK TO THE HAND GRENADE ANALOGY TTHE QUESTION IS IS THE HAND GRANANE EFFECTIVE OR IS THE HAND GRENAE NOT EFFECTIVE OU IF THE IDEA WAS THE TRUMPLICAN A COMMIN AN WHO'S GEN A WRECK THE THE WAGHS THET THING WHO'S GOT WRECK THE STATUST QUO THE QUESTION IS WHAT DOES THAT MEAN BREAKFAST AT IS QUOT IN TRMS OF ASTUAL POLICY BECUSE THE TRUTH IS THAT IN TERMS OF UP ENDING DEMOCRATIC POLICY DI SANS IS TAT A HELV LOT MORE HNSTADE OF FLOORER THAN TRUMPDED AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BUT IF WHAT WE MEAN IS THAT TRUMP TICKS OFF ALL THE PEOPLE WE LIKE TO LATCH TICKED OFF THERE'S NO ONE BETTER IN POLITICS PROBABLY IN HISTORY THEN TRUMP AT THAT THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THAT ACTUALLY ADDS UP TO A POLICY WIN SO RE PUBLICAN VOTERS GINTO HAVE TO DESIDE KIND OF WHAT THEY WANT HERE DO THEY WANT THE BEST SHOT AT WINNING INDEPENDENCE THEY WANT THE BEST SHOT AT WINNING NATIONALLY THEY WENT BY SHOBENAN IN PLACES LIKE GEORGIA AND WISCONSIN IN THE ARIZONA ORS THEY WANT THE GUID WHO'S GOIN A TPISS OFF THE LEFT THE BOST BECAUSE IF THEY WANT THET HAS CAN A PISS

ASKED APPARENTLY ABOUT THE RISING DETAL AND HI WHILE HE'S ON THE BEACH AND HE SAID NO COMMENT AND THEN HE HEADED HOME S A SLOW CLAP FOR VERY VERY CARRYING DEEPLY COMPASSIONATE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES MEANWHILE WE NOW HAVE MORE STAFTS ABOUT HOW MUCH FAMILYES OR PAYING THAN THEY DID TWO YEARS AGO ACCORDING TO SEE AN AND BUSINESS OF ALL PLACES THER' TYPICAL AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD SPENT SEVEN HUNDRED AND NINE MORE DOLLARS IN JULY THAN THEY DID TWO YEARS AGO BY THE SAME EXACT GOODS IN SERVICES ACCORING TO MOODIES THAT'S THE SIVE INCREASE MASS OF INCREASE THERE'S  SEVEN HNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THE SAME GOODS AND SERVICES TE SEND THAT OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR IN' TAING EIGHTY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT YOUR SPENDING MORE THIS OR THAN YOU WERE TWO YEARS AGO THOSE ARE HUGE NUMBERS BECAUE REMEMBER WHENEVER JOBIDANCE AS WELL YOU KNOW WEVE HAS YOURNE THER'RE COMING DOWN IRYO WOT BUT NERNO THE INCREASE IN INFLATION IS COMING DOWN EVERY MONT EXCEP FOR LAST MONTH WHEN IT DIDN'T BUT ITE WAS COMING DOWN EVERY MONTH BUT THAT JUST MEANS THAT YOUR ADDING IN FLATION ON TOP OF INFLATION IT'S LIKE SAYING THA YOU SPEND A THOUSAND DOLARS LAST MONTH ON YOUR CREDICARD AND THIS MONTH SPENT NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS YOU BROUGHT IT DOWN BY A HUNDRED DOLLARS I MEAN THAT'S TRUE BUT YOU'LSO HAD A NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO YOUR DEBT WHICH IS WHAT JOBITN HAS BEN DOING WITH REGARD TO IN PFLATION MARSANDY THE CHIEF A CONNMIS O MOODIES SET HIGH IN FLATION OF TH PASTRPLAS YEARS HAS DONE A LOT OF ECONOMIC DAMAGE WMOST OF THAT INCREASE IN HOUSEHOLD SPENDING IS DRIVEN BY HOUSING COST WHICH OAFD SURGE HE ADDED THAT FAMILIES ARE LSO SPENDING MORE AT THE GROCERY STORE ON BUYING MAINTAINING IN INSURING VEHICLES AND ON RECREATIONAL SERVICES LIKE CABLE PACHECKS HAVE NOT GROWN BY NEARLY AS MUCH AS THE COST OF LIVING IT IS LI KEEP SAYING THAT GRAVITY IS GOING TO DRAG THE ECONOMY BACK DOWN WHILST YOUR JOURNAL HAS AN ENTIRE PIECE NON AMERICA'S CREDIT RATING ACCORDING TO SPENCER JAKE UB AT WRITING FOR THE WASTER JOURNAL INVESTORS HAF HISTORICALLY PAID A STEEP PENALTY TO HUNKER DOWN IN SUPERSAFE SHORT FROM GOVERNMENT SECURITIES FOR EXAMPLE A HUNDRED BUTS INVESTED IN THREE MONTH TREASURY BILLS IN NINETEEN TWENTY EGHT GRUETS ONLY TWO THOUSAND ONE HUDRED FORTY ONE BOOX BY THE END OF LAST YEAR WHILE BECAME FORTY SIX GRAND INVESTED MEDIUM GREAT CORPERET BONDS AND AWAPING SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FOR GRAN IF INVESTED IN STOCKS ACCORDING TO DATA FROM AND WHY YOU FINANCE PROFESSOR BASUAF DEMERDEMER DARON ESPESUALLY THE EARS FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS ANYTHING SHORT HERM IN SAFE PAID NEXT TO NOTHING BUT THE FEDERAL ESERVES FIGHTING AGAINST IN FLATION IS AMPLIFIED THE RISK ALVE AN UNTHINKABLE FYSCAL CRISIS MADE POSSIBLE BY DECATES OF WASHINGTON TIS FUNCTION SO THAT MEANS THAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY SPENDING A BUNCH OF MONEY TO GET INTO SHORT FROM GOVERNMENT SECURITIES WHICH PAYS YOU ALMOST NOTHING THAT'S O FREET DOUT PEOPLE ARE CASH MIGHT BE CAME ALTHOUGH THEY WRE CALLED CERTIFICATES OF CONFISCATION THE INFLATIONARY NINETEEN SEVENTIES LONGER FROM TREASURIES HAVE BEN THE GO TO ASSAT IN TIMES OF CRISIS THE TEN YEARS NOTE YIELD IS LITERALLY THE RIST FREE RAE USED TO VALUE ALL OTHER SECURITIES BUT THE GOVERNMENTS PILE OF DEBT HAS NOW SWELLED FOLLOWING THE WAR ON TERROR THE GLOBILL FINANCIAL CRISIS AMICOVE INETEEN PENS EMIC LOW INTFRESTRATES AND FED BON BUYING MASSD THE STRAIN INTEREST COST WERE RECENTLY NO HIGHER THAN IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES BUT THE TREASURY BARELY SEES THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOCK IN THOSE ROCK BOTTOM RASE BY ISSUING MORE LONG TUR NOTES AND BONDS AND NOW IT IS TOO LAT LONG FROM BUNCH OF FORE CAST SAY TOU UST THAT HELD BY THE PUBLIC WILL SURPASSAD G  P THIS FISCAL YEAR INTEREST ON THE THAT WILL EQUAL THREE QUARTERS OF DISCRESTIONARY NON DEFENCE SPENDING BY TWENTY THIRTY ONE IT WILL BE AS LARGE THAS RIGHT INTEREST ON OUR NATIONAL THAT WILL BE THE SAME AS ALL DISCRESSIONARY NON DEFENCE SPENDING IN THE AMERICAN BUDGENT BY TWENTY THIRTY ONE SO OM WE ARE IN SERIOUS  TROUBLE ACTUALLY THAT FORECAST IS PROBABLY TO OPTIMISTIC THE SWILING A THE SWELLOING PILE OF DEBT MEANS MINOR CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS T NOW HAVE HUGE CONSEQUENCES ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF TREASURIES MUST BE ROLLED OVER WITHIN FIVE YEARS COMPOUND INTEREST HAS A QUICK HAS A WAY OF QUICKLY MAKING A BAD SITUATION WORSE SO WHAT YOUR WASHING BASICALLY IS THAT AMERICA'S THAT PROMISE SNOW BALLING AND IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE AND DRVIDON HAS EXASCURBTED THAT PROBLEM SO WHAT EXACTLY TO DEMOCRAS AFTER A LI UPON HERE WELL THE CAROLINE THEIR GOOD GOVERNMENTS SO WHAT THEIR GUNNEROLION IS TRYING TO SCARE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE INTO BELIEVING THE DEMOCRACY ITSELF IS ABOUT TO COLLAPSE IS WHAT COMELLA HERRIS IS SAYING IS WHY JANUARY SIXTH AS AT THE CENTER OF EVERYTHING THAT DEMOCRATS DO HERE IS COMLA HERIS OVER THE WEEK GAN WORLSMOST ON TALENTS OF POLITICION MAKING HER CASE THE DEMOCRACY IS AT STAKE OF COURSE WHAT IS IT TIN YOU HAVE WOS YOUR MINDGREATE ATMA I ON GIVE ME RINK WVI THINK EVERYTHING AS IT STAY RIGHTA DEMOCRACY IS INTACT  IT'S STRENGTHENS THE PEOPLE IT PRE TECTS AND FIGHTS FOR FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS IT'S A IT'S A FIGHTFOR ORDER AGAINST CAOS ITS STRENGTHENS ON THE OTHER HAND NAILES O DEMOCRACY INCREDIBLY FRAGIL IT WILL ONLY BE AS STRONG AS OUR ROINGESS TO FIGHT R MAN WHEN YOU PILE ON TRUISMS THAT WAY MAN THAT IS  BAD POLITIC IN THAT FROM COMLA SHE IS TRULY AWFUL OF US U TRULY TRULY ALFUL OF THIS BUT SHE ELSO DOES DECLARE HERSELF A RO MILES THAT'S EXCITIN A ROE MODELL TO DUMB PEOPLE EVERYWHERE HERE'S COMMEA HARRIS BUT THE THING ABOUT BIN A ROMO PEOPLE WATCH WHAT YOU DO TO SE IF IT LAS UP WITH WHAT YOU SAY WHAT SHE DOES IS NOTTHING IT'S NOTHING SHE DOES NOTHING FOR A LIVING BUT IN THE END THERESALL THEY HAVE THE CAN A TRYING SCARE AMERICANS ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THE TRUTH IS SO FAR IT'S WORKED IN REPUBLICANS CAN SAY THAT IT HASN'T BUT IT ABSOLUTELY HAS SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN ONTRUMPL AS LECTED EVER SINCE THEN THE CASE DEMOCRATO MADE IS THE CRAZY HAS TO STOP AND THEN THEY POINT AT A BUNCH OF REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES RANGE MEN PHERSIAL WALKER IN GEORGIA TO BLAKE MASTERIS IN ARIZONA TO DUG MASTERIANO AND PENNSYLVANIA AND VORTERS GO AN AND THEY LISTEN TO IT AND IT TURNS OUT THET REPUBLICANS SHOULD STOP BANGING THEIR HEAD AGAINST A BRICK WALL PERHAPS THE BEST WAY TO RUN AGAINS SOMEBODYAT SUPREMELY UNPALATABLE LIKE JOBIDON SUPREMELY IRRITATING LIKE COMMELHRRIS IS TO RUN SOMEBODY WHOSE ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT PALATABLE BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS A REPUBLICANS CAN'T GET EXCITETE TO VOTE AGAINST IT JOBIDON AND COM HRRIS I DON'T KNOW WHAT BUSINESS REPUBLICANS HAVE GETTING INTO A A BOTING BOOT MEAN JUST BECAUSE JOBIDON IS AN INCREDIBLY BORING ELDERLY FELLOW DOES NOT MEAN YOU SHOULDN'T BE EXCITED TO VOTE AGAINST HIM AND GET HIM OUT OF OFFICE BUT I SUPPOSE THAT IF I ALL POLITICS JUST BECOMES A BATTLE OF PERSONALITY THEN N WE ARE IN A RACE TO THE BOTTOM FROM HERE UNTIL THE END OF TIME PROBABLY SO NOW DARK THOUGHTS HERE ON MONDAY BUT THE REALITY IS THAT EM CRASER IN CREDIBLY BUTABLE AND IF JOBIDON AND COMMLAHARIS CANNOT BE BEAT I UN I HONEST TO GOD DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT REPUBLICANS ARE DOING FOR LIVING REMEMBER A COUPLE OF YEARS GO I SPOKE AT A HOUSE REPUBLICAN SUMMIT THIS BEFORE TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND I SAID TO THEM IF YOU LEST DON'T TAKE BACK THE HOUSE EVERY ONE OF YOU SHOULD BE FIRED BECAUSE IT'S A TARGET RICH ENVIRONMENT THIS IS A TARGET RICH ENVIRONMENT IF REPUBLICANS CANNOT ACTUALLY A CHIEF VICTORY AGAINST JOBIDON AND COMMEL HARRIS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO FOR A LIVING OR WHY WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEM IN ANY WAY SHE PERFORMED I'M SORRY BUT BLAMING EVERYBODY ELSE FOR LOSING IS NOT GOING TO PUTT IT MARDY TIME FOR SOME THINGS I LIKE AT THEN SOME THINGS THAT I HATE SO LAST WEEK I SUGGESTED THE CARRYLAKE WOULD BE A BAD CANDIDATE FOR SENATE IN ARIZONA AND I HOPE BY THAT BECAUSE SHE LOST TO A WET RAG IN CATY HOBS HOWEVER SHE DID HAVE HERSELF WHEN CE MOMENT AND I WELL OVER THE WEKEN I SHE WAS ASKED ABOUT WHETHER THREARE IN FACTORY GENTERS SHE WAS MILKING A COW AT THE TIME AND A HERIA RESPONSE WHICH WHAT AV YOU FON THE NEW AR TIME TOU KNOTHER'S ONLY TWO GENDERS RIHT

MONEY SHOULD GO TO OTHER PEOPLE ONE OF THE SOME OF THE LURICS IN THE SONG OUR LORD WE GOT FOLKS IN THE STREET AND GOT NOTHING TO EAT AND THE OBEST MILKING WELFARE WELL GOD FOR FIVE FOOT THREENG OR

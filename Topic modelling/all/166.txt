NEEDTO BE PART OF THE BATE AND AND FRANKLY I TOTALLY GET I GET I HE DID THE SAME THING IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AFTER THE MAGIN CELLY DEBATE WHERE HE DIDN'T LIKE THE QUESTION TO HIS ASKY SIMPLY LEFT THE NEXT TO BATE YOUS SUBSCONDET USELY I'M NOT KING T TO BE PART OF THIS I DIDN'T HURT HIM IN ANYWAY SHAPE OR FORM ONAL LOGICAL LEVEL MAKES PERFECT SENS FROM NOT TO TAKE PART IN THE RE PUBLICAN DEBATE OU OR PRINCIPAL LEVEL HE CERTAINLY SHOULD BECAUSE THERE'S SERIOUS QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED BOUT WHETHER HE SHOULD BE THE NOMINE OR NOT IS TRUE FOR ANYBODY WHO'S RUNNING FOR THE NOMINATION JOBIDON SHOULD BE DEBATING ROBERT AFF KENNEDY JUNIOR FOR SHORT AND PEOPLE WHO ARE VOTING FOR TRUMPET THE PRIMARIES SHOULD REMEMBER F THIS TACTIC BECAUSE I PROMISE YOU PROMISE YOU PROMISE YOU ONE YEAR FROM NOW WHEN JOBIDON IS TH NOMINATE IF DONALD TRUMP IS THE NOMINATE JOBIDON WILL NOTS BATE DONAL TRUMP GET READY FOR IT IT IN'T CON A HAPPEN JOBIN WILL MAKE ANY EXCUSE HE'S NOT CAN O GET ON A STAGE WITH HIM AND DONAL TRUMPS PEOPLE WILL SAY WELL HE'S AFRAID AND AT THAT POINT EVERY DEMOCRAT AND EVERY MEMBER THE MEDIA WILL COME BACK AND SAY WILL DONALD TRUMP DODN DEBATE ANY OF THE REPUBLICANS WY EXACTLY SHOULD JOBIDON TEBATE DONAL TRUMP BIDN'S EXCUSE WILL BE SOMETHING ABOUT TRUMPING AN INSURRECTIONARY OR TRUMP BEING A CRIMINAL IN TA TE OR WHATEVER IT IS AND THE MEDIO WILL SIDE WITH JOBIDON AND THERE WILL BE NO TOBATE SO IF YOUARE NOMINATING DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO DEBATROBIDEN JUST GET READY JOBIDON IS NOT GOING TO BATE DONAL TRUMP BUT PUT THAT ASIDE THERE'S A PERFECTLY LOGICAL REASON FOR DONALD TRUMP NOT TO DEBATE THE REST OF THE RE PUBLICAN FIELD NAMELY HE IS LEADING THEM BY LEAPS AND BOUND THRE'S A BRAN NEW SEE BS POLL AND WHAT IT SHOWS IS TRUMP WAY OUT IN TRUMP AT SIXTY TWO PER CENT OF THE VOTE SIXTY TWO PER CENT OF THE VOT FOR DONAL TRUMP THAT IS A MASSIVE NUMBER FOR NONAL TRUMP NOW ONE OF THE THEORIES BOT TRUMP HAD BEEN THAT HE'SGOING A HOVER ROUND IN THE THIRTIES MAYBE IN THE FORTIES IF WHO'S LUCKY WHO'D BREAK FIFTY HEMMAN SIXTY TWO PER CENT IS NOT CHALLENGEABLE BECAUSE WITH THAT MEANS AT SIXTY TWO PER CENT OBVIOUSLY IS IT NO CONSOLIDATION OF THE FIELD IS LIKELY TO MATTER NOW IT'S OBVIOUSLY SUPER EARLY A LOT CAN HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW IN JANUARY INCLUDING POSSIBLE ACTUAL COURT TIME FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HOWEVER A HUGE PER CENTAGE OF TRUMPS BASE IS VERY LOCKED IN ON DONAL TRUMP WHICH MAN YOU BY THE TICKET YOUN TAKE THE RIDE YET WHATEVER IT' CAN TO BE IT'S CAN O BEE I'M JUSTGOIN TO SAY EVERY TOTOLOGY I KNOW RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT EVERYONE KNOWS DONAL TRUMP'S FLAWS TO CANDIDATE EVERYTHNG'LL PERSON TH UNITED STATES HAS AN OPINION ON DONAL TRUMP DONAL TRUMP IS BATED INTO THE CAKE YOU'R YOU YOU'RE TAKING IN AWFUL BIG BAT VATER THIS HAD BETTER WORK  MEAN IF IF DONALD TRUMP IS THE NOMINATE TYOU'RE RUNING DIRECTLY AGAINST FOUR SEPERATE INVITEMENTS TAT ARE CUM COMING DOWN IN THE FIRST HALF OF NEXT YEAR YOU'RE RUNING DIRECTLY AGAINST THE GENERALIZED AMERICAN PERCEPTION THAT DONAL TRUMP WAS NOT A GOOD ACTOR BETWEEN NOVMEMBER FOURTH OF TWO TH OUSON AND TWENTY AND JANUARY SIXTH OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE EG THAT'S JUST WHAT IT IS CANG IF YOU LOOK THE PULLING ON THE GENERALELECTION DATO RIGHT NOW GENERAL LECTION DATA SAYS THAT DONALD TRUMP IS COMPETITIVE WITH JOBIDON BUT DONALD TRUMP IS NOT BREAKING FORTY FIVE FORTY SIX PER CENT IN ANY POLE THOS THE UPPER END POLLS FOR HIM IN THE GENERAL ELECTION CYCLE NOW YOU MAY THINK THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE BCAUSE THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO COLLAPSE YOU MAY THINK THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE BECAUSE JOBIDON HAS HEALTH PROBINS YOU MAY THINK THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE BECAUSE OF ALL F THE HUNTER BIDEN OF IT ALL THAT MAY WELL HAPPEN RIGHT WHOEVER IS THE NOMINY OF A MAJOR AMERICAN PARTY HAS A SHOT AT BECOMING PRESIDENT OF TE UNITED STATES AS WE LEARNED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN THE YOR TIMES HAT DONALD TRUMP IS A ONE PERCENT POSSIBILITY OF BECOMING PRESIENT AND THEN BY THE END OF THE NIGHT ONELECTIONNIGHT HE WS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SO IF HE IS THE NOMINA SURE THERE'S A GOOD SHOT HE COUL BECOME PRESIDEM BY GOOD I MEAN LIKE IF YOU'RE TRYING TO BALL PART THISTHING OUT A ONE IN THREE SHOT OF HIM BEING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE HE LOST ALL THE STATES YOU WOULD NEED TO WIN NEXT TIME YOU NEED TO WIN GEORGIA HOU NEED O WIN ARIZONA THOUGH NOT EVEN BE SUFFICIENT HOUD THEN HAVE TO WIN ONE OF THE FOLLOWING THREE WITS GONSON MICHIGAN OR PENNSYLVANIA RIGHT AND RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE PULLING HEIS LOOSING IN ALL OF THOSE PLACES RIGHT THE ONLY PLACE WHERE HE MAY BE COMPETITIVE AMONG THOSE STATES RIGHT NOW IS GEORGIAM THAT IS LARGELY BECAUSE THE PRESENTS OF BRYAN KAMP IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA WHO REMAINS A POPULAR FIGURE BUT THERECAN BE A LOT OF STATES THAT ARE UP FOR PLAY IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IF DONALD TRUMP IS THE NOMINATE AND'S NOT JUST ONES I MENTION  NORTH CAROLINA IS CIN EUP FOR PLAY I KNOW LOT PEOPLE ARE SLEEPING ON TEXAS I WONTO BE ALARMIST YEARE BUT TED CRUISE IS GIN TO RUN A ROUGH RACE IN IN THE SENATE IN TEXAS ESPECIALLY BCAUSE GREGG ABBOT WHO'S A POPULAR GOVERNOR OF TEXAS IS NOT GOING TO BE TOP OF THE BALLAT LAST TIME CRUISE RAN YEFT REMEMBER THAT GREGG ABBOT WAS ALSO RUNNING GREGG ABBOT WAS A POPULAR GOVERNOR THAT S IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND TED CRUISE ENDED UP WINNING OVER BADE A ROAR BY A COUPLE OF HUNDRED THOUSAND VOTES OUT ABOUT EIGHT MILLION VOTES CAST WELL THAT RACE COULD BE REALLY REALLY TIGHT THIS TIME CAUSE GREGG ABBOT IS NOT AT THE TOP OFTHE TICKET AND THAT COULD BE A REAL PROBLEM FOR DONAL TRUMP YES BELIEVE IT OR NOT IN TEXAS THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO HAPPEN BUT DO DEMOCRAT SEE THAT IS THE STATE THAT IS IN PLAY IF DONALD TRUMP IS ON THE BOU THEY DO SO AGAIN DONALD TRUMP RIGHT NOW LEADING IN THE RE PUBLICAN FIELD BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS ALSO IN TERMS OF GENERAL ELECTION IF YOU ARE THAT IS AT BEST OF FIFTY FIFTY BAT THAT'S IT NOW IS AT POSSIBLE THAT THAT'S BETTER THAN ANY OF THE OTHER REPUBLICANS NOW I TEND TO DOUTIT BUT CERTAINLY IT'S POSSIBLE WHY ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE AT THIS POINT BUT DO I THINK IN MY HEART OF HEARTS THE DONALD TRUMP IS AS LIKELY TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY IF HE IS THE NOMINE AS PRETTY MUCH ANY OF THE OTHE RE PUBLICAN CANDIDATES WHO DON'T HAVE THE SAME BAKED IN NEGATIVES HIS DONALD TRUMP I THINK T AT THE TRUMP HAS A VERY VERY BIG PROBLEMS THAT FACE HIM SO YOU CAN HOPE THAT JOBIDON IS JUST REALLY REALLY BAD AND THAT ANY ONE COULD SNEAK IN BUT THAT'S OT REALLY AN ARGUMENT FOR TRUMP THAT'S AN ARGUMENT THAT PRETY MUCH ANYBODY CAN SNEAK IN IF JOBIDON IS THE CANDIDATE WHICH REQUIRESYOU TO ASK THE QUESTIONIST WHETHER THEN TRUMP SHOULD BE THE NOMINE ANYWAY NONE OF THIS MATTERS IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL DATA TO DAY THE ACTUAL DAY TO TO DAY WHATEVER I SAY DONALD TRUMP IS WINNIG THE NOMINATION BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS AGAIN THE SEE BEEST POLE HAS HIM UP OVER THE NEAREST COMPETITOR BY FORTY SIX POINTS BY FORT Y SIX POINTS AND AGAIN THATIS NOT BEAUSE OF A SPLIT IN THE FIELD THAT IS BECAUSE HE'S AT SIXTY TWO PERCENT OF VOTE SO THE RET THE S PS POLE GOING INTO THE BATE WEEK IT'S PRETTY FASCINATING BECAUSE IT SHOWS HOW THE REPUBLICAN ELECTORATE IS THINKING ABOUT

WHICH CON CERNS YOU MORE ABOUT THE LATEST TRUMP INDICTMENTS WHETHER IT'S POLITICALLY MOTIVATED WHETHER TRUMP TRIED TO OVERTURN THE PRESIDENTUAL ELECTION OR BOTH SEVENTY SEVEN PER CENT SAY THE INDICTMEN IS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED WHICH OF PORSE IS TRUE AS FAR AS TOP READSONS FOR CONSIDERING TRUM NINETY NINE PER CENT AMONG THOSE WHO ARE OR MIGHT BE CONCERNING GONING FOR TRUMP NINETY NINE PER CENTS AYE TINGS WERE BETTER UNDER TRUMP WHICH IS TRUE NINETY FIVE PER CENT FIGHTS FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME SEVENTY SIX PER CENT KOW HIM BETTER THAN OTHER CANDIDATES AND SEVENTY FOUR PER CENT ALWAYS BEEN A SUPPORTER CAN REMEMBER THAT IS LIKE SEVENTY FOUR PER CENT OF PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN A SUPPORTER OF TRUMP QUART IN THAT SIXTY TWO PER CENT WHICH IS STILL ABOVE FIFTY PER CENT OR JUST BELOW FIFTY PER CENT BY THE CALCULATION WIRE AS FAR AS WEATHER YOU ARE SUPPORTING TRUMP BECAUSE OF HIS LEGAL INDICTMENTS SEVENTY THREE PER CENT OF TRUMSVOTERS SEVENTY THREE PER CENT SAY THAT YOU ARE VOTING FOR HIM BECAUS YOU ARE SHOWING SUPPORT FOR HIM DURING THE LEGAL INDICTMENTS THAT IS WHAT THE C PS POINS HAS NOW I'VE A PRETTY SERIOUS SORT OF INTELLECTUAL PROBLEM WITH THIS WHICH IS YOU DONT NOMINATE A CANDIDATE BECAUSE YOU WISH TO SHOW SUPPORT FOR THEM ON AN ANCILERY ISSUE YOU NOMINATED CANDIDATE BECAUSE YOU WISH FOR THEM TO WIN SO OVER THE WEEK END I ASK PEOPLE LIKE LET'S A SUME PER CECOND THET THESE TWO THINGS ARE IN CONFLICT SUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP IN TERMS OF GIVING YOUR MONEY TO HIM AND YOUR NOMINATION TO HIM AND WINNING THE GENERAL LECTION WHICH ONE IS MORE IMPORTANTBUT SUPPORTING HIM IN THE TRIALS BY GIVING HIM THE NOMINATION OR  WINNING THE ELECTION IF THOSE TWO THINGS ARE AN OPPOSITION AND VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY SAID THAT THEY WERE VERY MUCH INTERESTED WINNING THE ELECTION BUT WHAT'S CAN HAVE TO HAPPEN FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY REALIZE THAT IS FOR PEOPLE ACTHLY STAR THINKING OF THOSE TWO TH NGS IN OPPOSITION IT MAY BE TOO EARLY FOR THAT 'S GAIN THE PULLING NUMBERS FOR JOBIDON ARE SO LOW AT THIS POIN THE TRUMPLICS COMPETITIVE EVEN WITH THE INDICTMENTS AN MEANWHILE IT'S PRETTY AMAZING AMONG THOSE WHO SAY THAT HONESTY IS VERY IMPORTANT IN THE GEOPE NOMINATION SIXTY ONE PER CENT SAY THAT THE MOST HONEST CANDIDATE THE CANDIDATE WHO THEY CHOOSE IF HONESTY IS A TOP PRIARTY FOR THEM SIXTY ONE PER CENTS A TRUMP SEVENTEEN PER CENTATE ISANTIS NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN PEOPLE ANSWER THIS QUESTION THEY'RE NOT USING TRUTH TO MEAN TRUTH THEYRE USING TRUTH AS A PROXY FOR SAYS THAT THINGS HE FEELS LIKE SAYING AT ANY GIVEN THEY'RE USING TRUTH AS A PROXY FOR AUTHENTICITY WHICH AGAIN I HAVE AN INTELLECTUAL PROBLEM WITH TRUTH IS NOT AUTHENTICITY I KNOW AN AWFUL LOT OF ATHENTIC PEOPLE WHO LIE ON THE REGULAR I KNOW AN AWFUL LOT OF AUTHENTIC PEOPLE WHYRE REALLY QUITE TERRIBLE BECAUSE AUTHENTICITY IS NOT AN A MORAL QUALITY AUTHENTICITY IS YOU HAVING NO ACTUAL BRAIN TO MOUTH FILTER IT TURNS OUT THAT MANY OF THE MOST CON SIDERATE BEST PEOPLE YOU KNOW ARE IN AUTHENTIC IN THE CENTS THAT IF YOU CONSIDER AUTHENTICITY TO BE WHATEVER YOUR INSTINCT IS THAT DAY THEN YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO SIT THERE AND BE LIKE O CA I'M NOT GOING TO BE AUTHENTIC WHEN I TELL MY WIFE SHE LOOKS FAT IN THAT DRESS AND HAV YOU A STUPID THING TO DO OR WHEN I TELL MY NEIGHBOR THAT HE'S A JERK OR WONIT  WOULD MAKE OU MORE AUTHENTIC TO SAY THE SURE YOU BE LIKE TIM CARRYAN LIAR LIAR AND TATWOULD MAKE YOU AUTHENTIC WOULE TO MAKE YOU LIKE PARTICULARLY A GOOD PERSON WOULD AKE YOU SOMEBODY WHO SPEAKS THE TRUTH VERY OFTEN THE THING THAT YOU SAY THAT'S THAT'S AUTHENTIC IS NOT TRUE AND BECAUE YOU'REDEFENDING YOURSELF MY SEVEN YEAR OLD SON CONSTANTLY WHEN HE GETS IN TROUBLE HE  VERY AUTHENTICALLYO WE'LL TELL ME THAT IT IS NOT HIS FAULT AND IT IS ONE HUNDRED PER CENT HIS F HULT THE'S NOT TASTOGF HAPPENS ALL THE TIME OF GAINS HOWEVER AGAIN MY OPINION ON THIS DOESN'T MATTER THE GUOP PE VOTERS OPINION MATTERS SIXTY ONE PER CENT OF ALL GEOPE VOTERS IN THE PRIMARY SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP IS THEIR CANDITATE IF HONESTY IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM NOT ONLY THAT AMONG TRUMP VOTERS SEVENTY ONE PER CENT OF TRUM VOTERS SAY THEY THEY WRE THY'RE GIVEN OPTIONS AS TO WHAT THEY FEEL THEY THEY'RE GIVE MUCH OF SOURCES AN THEY WARE ASKED O CA OF THESE SOURCES WHO DO YOU TRUST MOST TO TELL YOU WHAT IS TRUE AND THIS IS PRETTY AMAZING STAT SO TRUM VOTERS WERE ASSES OF THOSE TRUMP VOTERS FORTY TWO PER CENTS SAID THEY TRUST THEIR RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO TELL THEM TRUE THINGS WHICH IS LIKE ASTONISHING THAT'S AN ASTONISHINGLY IN A LOW LOW NUMBER FORTY TWO PER CENT TRUST THEIRE RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO TL THEM TRUE THINGS FIFTY SIX PER CENTS A CAN TOR REMEDIA FIGURS SIXTY THREE PER CENTS A FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND SEVENTY ONE PER CENTS A TRUMP WHICH MEANS THAT OF TRUMP VOTERS THAT SHOULD TRUST DONALD TRUMP TO SAY TRUE THINGS TO THEM MORE THAN THEY TRUST THEIR FRIENDS AND FAMILY CAN SERVE TO ME YO FIGURES OR THEIR OWN RELIGIOUS LEADERS WHO I MEAN BOTTOM LINE IS THAT I'M ON IN HA UTILITARIAN LEVEL YEU CAN'T BREAK THAT STRANGLE HOLD HOWXICLLY YOU BEAK THAT STRANGLEHOLD HOWDO YOU SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP I'S NOT TELLING YOU THE TRUTH WHEN HE IS NOT TELLING YOU THE TRUTH WHEN YOU TRUST TRUM MORE THAN YO TRUST THE PERSON WHO SAYIN THE TRUMP IS NOT TELLING YOU THE TRUTH THERE'S NO WAY TO BREAK THAT STRANGLE HOLD PER SAY WHICH IS WHY REALLY THE ONLY ATTACK LINE THAT THAT EVER WAS GOING TO GET ANY TRACTION WITH REGARD TO A HUGE PER CENTENT OR PRIMARY VOTERS WAS THE DONALD TRUMP IS NOT THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATE TO WIN THE SELECTION THAT WHICH AGAIN I THINK THAT'S TRUE BUT DONAL TRUMP IS ANY OP POSIT AND LOIES PEOPLE TRUST ONAL TRUMP TO SAY THE TRUE THING SO IN DONAL TRUMP SAYS I'M GOING TO WIN AND I'M WINNING BIG AD ALL THE POLES AND THERE ARE NO POLES SHOWING HIM WINNING BIG AGAINST JOBIDEN THE MATTER THEY TRUST HIM MORE THAN THE TRUST THE POLES THEY TRUST HIM MORE THAN TRUST FRIENDS AND FAMILY DONAL TRUMP HAS FORGE TO CONNECTION WITH THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT HIM STRONGER THAN ANY POLITICAL FIGURE OF MY LIFE TIME THAT IS JUST A FACT WHETHER I LIKE IT OR NOT WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT AND THAT CONNECTION MEANS THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE FACTS ARE WHAT THE DATA ARE OR ANY O THE REST OF THIS IT MEANS THAT IF HE SAYS THAT HE IS GOING TO WIN PEOPLE TRUST HIM THAT HE'S GOING TO WIN IF HE SAID THAT HE DID WIN PEOPLE TRUST HIM THAT HE DID WIN IF HE SAYS THE POLES SHOW THAT HE'S WINNING BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS PEOPLE TRUNT AND E CIDN'T SHIFT HIS POSITION ON THE DIME AND PEOPLE STILL TRUST HIM BECAUSE HE HAS BECOME A SOURCE OF ALL OF ENORMOUS TRUTH AGAIN MORE THAN RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND TRIENDS OF FAMILY FOR LOT OF RE PUBLICAN VOTERS NOW WITH ALL OF THAT SAID THERE ARE FEW DOWNSIDES IN THIS POLE FOR DONAL TRUMP FIFTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE IN THIS IN THIS POLE LIKELY CHOPY PRIMARY VOTERS SAY THAT THE CAMPAGN HAS BEEN TOO MUCH BOUT TRUMP THIRTY ONE PER CENT SAY ABOUT THERIGH AMOUNT NINETEEN PER CENT SAY NOT ENOUGHABOUT TRUMPS BUT SPLIT ABOUT FIFTY FIFTY TOO MUCH ABOUT TRUMP NOT ENOUGH ABOUT TRUMP AS FAR AS WHO PEOPLE THING WOULD BE BIDEN THAT GAIN THESE ARE THE STAFTS THAT THAT START TO BORDER ON YET WHAT WHAT I THING IS THE UNFACTUAL SIXTY ONE PER CENT OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS SAY THAT DONAL TRUMP IS DE CANDIDATE MOST LIKELY TO BE JOBIDON SIXTY ONE PER CENT THIRTY FIVE PER CENTS A IS SANTS IS TWENTY PERCENTS GOT EIGHTEEN PER CENT TIVAGUE FOURTEEN PER CENT HAYLEY FOURTEEN PER CENT PENTS AS FAR AS THE SANTS IS WOULD HE BE BIDN RIGHT NOW ONLY THIRTY FIVE PER CENT OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS SAY THAT TE SANTIS WOULD DEFINITELY BE BIDON AS POT TO FIFTY PER CENT JUNE FORTY SEVEN PER CENT SAY THAT HE MIGHT AN EIGHTEEN PER CENT SAY THAT HE BE A LONG SHOT SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS HAPPENING HERE IS ALSO THAT THE AGAIN THAT GENERALIZED PER CEPTION THAT THE BEST CANDIDATE TO BE BIDON WOULD BE TRUMP IS BEING BOLLSTERED BY TOO SEPARATE PER CEPTIONS ONE IS IN TO SANTS IS CONTROL AN ONE IS NOT ONE IS THAT YOBIDON IS SO WEAK IN THE POLLIG THT THERE'S A PERCEPTION THAT ANY ONE INCLUDING TRUMP CAN BEAT IM AND THE OTHER IS THAT THE SANTIS HIMSELF HAS NOT RUNNING GOOD CAMPAGN TO THIS POINT WILL GET TO THAT IN ONE CECOND WHILE ABORTION ACTIVIS OFFER ATTACKS ON THE PROLIFE COMMUNITY AND TRIED TO INSURE THE RIGHT TO END A BABY'S LIFE  PREBORNS NETWORK OF CLINNIC'S OFFER LOVE AND LIFE TO INSURE A BABY SAFETY AND WELL BEING PREBORN IS A MINISTRY OF COMPASSION WHEN WOMAN HAS AN UNON TO

THIS TO THE DEBATE ITSELF AS HE SAY DONALL TRUMP RIGHT NOW HE'S GOT A LOCK ON TWO THIRDS OF THE REPUBLICAN BASE OR AT LEAST HALF OF THE E PUBLICAN BASIN OU  UP AGAIN ANY CONSOLIDATION OF THE FEELD RIGHT NOW DOES NOT LOOK SUFFICIENT TO OVERCOME IT THIS IS WHY HE'S NOT THEN A PARTICIPATE IN TH EBATE AND IS GOING TO UNDERMINE THE DEBATE ITSELFFRED HE'S DOING IT PRETAPED INTERVIEW WITH TUCKER CARLSON WHICH MAKES PERFECT TEN TAT ALLOWS HIM TO SLAP TDHERECTLY AGAINST FOX NEW IS THE WAY THAT GOING ON TUCKER DOES AND FOXEN FIRE TUCKER AND DOM AND MEANWHILE HE'LL GET BIG NUMBERS ON TWITTER NOW

YOU KEEP YOUR JOB WHICH SPEAKS TO IN GENERAL THESE STATE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHICH I'S BASBLY COME AND NON PROFIT FOR LOSERS IT'S MUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO CAN'T WIN AN ELECTION AND THEN THE'RE LIKE WE GOULDN'T WIN THE ELECTION BECAUSE OF THIS EXSTRANEOUS FACTOR GIVE US MORE MONEY AND FEEL BAD FOR US HOW THIS LADY HIS RETAINDER JOB IS BEYOND ME SHE'S RUNNING A PARTY THAT HAS LOST SEVERAL ELECTIONS RUNNING HAS UNDER PERFORM IN ALL THE ELECTIONS WERE IT SHOULD BE OVER PERFORMING I'S RUNNING UP INTW A TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ELECTION TICHEL WE REPUBLICANS SHOULD RETAKE THE SENATE AND NOW OUR VERY EASILY ON THE VERGE O'F CONTINUING TO LOSE THE SENATE AND MAYBE THE PRESIDENCY AGAIN AND SHE'S HOLDING A DEBATE AMONG THE PUBLICAN CANDIDATES SPONSERD BY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND BASICALLY DECLARING HER OWN PARTY OF RELEVENT BECAUSE HER ROLL IS A RELEVANT WHETL WOULD EXACTLY IS THE ARIN SEE STAND FOR IF THE GU SAYS SCREW YOU AND YOUR DEBATE I'M GOING ON TUCKER AND SHE'S LIKE WHAT ONE E YOU RING

LINE UP THERE I THINK THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WELL NOT BE THERE ON THEN DEBAT NIT WHATER YOUR PHOUGHTS ON TI AND WHO DIDNT MAKE THE DEBATE STAGE WI'M STILL ALL THEOU O THE PRESIDEA TRUMP PL OI THIN GET SELLIN PORIN THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HERE FROM ALL THE CANNIDATE IBUT THERE'S A LOT OF CANNADTES THT AE UALIFIED WHERE AT SEVEN RIN OW THAT IF OFFICIALLY QUALIFIED WITH THE SMALL DOLLAR DON ATIONS WIT THE PALLING THRASHOLD AN THE PLADGE AND THEN WE'VE GOT SOME THAT ARE ON THE COF SELL WORE CAN AV BE LOOCKING AT PALLS THE NEXT FEW DAYS THERE ARE THREE OR FOR THET ARE WAITING FORE ONE PORSA AND ONE ONE ATIONA PALL TO MAKE THAT DEBATE STAGE I GA SUM THAT IS SOME EXCITING STUFFS SHE'S IT SHE'S OBVISNATN N GET TRUMP THO PARTICIPATE YOU IMAGINE THE PUNISHMENT BA OK KA WELL YOUR SIRGETS CAMPY IN THE ROOM RIPPING ON TH OTHER CANDIDATES NO NO AN I DON'T KN EVEN OUGHT TO SAY ABOUT RONER ROMNEY MACTANIEL WHO BY THE WAY REMEMBER THE REASON SHE ORIGINALLY UNS UP IN THIS POSITION IS BECAUSE SHE WAS RELATED TO MIT ROMNEY DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T LIKE MAT ROMNYS SHE LITERALLY DROP ROMNY FROM HER NAME PRPRETTY WHILE PRETTY WHILED I CAN MEANWHILE THE DESANTIS CAMPAIGN OBVIOUSLY HAS BEEN RUNNING REALLY RUGH I THE LAUNCH WITH ELON MUSK HAD PROBLEMS AND THEN EVER SINCE HAS BEEN BAD NEW CYCLE AFTER BAD NEW CYCLE FOR THE DISANTIS CAMPAIGN I THINK THAT DISSANTIS THOUGHT WHEN HE TRUMPED INTO THE RACE HE WAS GOING TO BE SEEN AS TRUMP WITHOUT ALL OF THE BAGGAGE AND INSTEAD HE IS SORT OF SCENE AS TRUMP WITHOUT THE CHARM BECAUSE THE BAGGAGE ON TRUMP DOESN'T WERE MEEN THE REALITYES THE REPUBLICAN BASE THE MORE BAGGAGE YOU PILE ON TRUMP THE MORE THE REPUBLICAN BASE SEEZE TRUMP AS SOME HEROIC OX WHO CAN ACTUALLY HOLD ALL TH BAGGAGE RIGHT THE MORE STUFFY PILE ON HIM THE RU MAN THAT GI'S GOT BROAD SHOULDERS LOOK D ALL THE BAGGAGEING CARRY AND SO THE SANTUS HAS BEEN STRUGGLING FOR A LINE OF ATTACK GAND HIS ORIGINAL LINE OF TACK WAS ELECTABILITY THE BADPOLL MUMBERS FOR BIDON COMBINED WITH THE FACT THAT HE IS NOT RUN AWAY IN THOSE PULLS AGAINST BIDON BASICALLY'VE TAKEN AWAY THE ELECTABILITY ARGMENT FROM HIM AND SO HE HAS TO RECAPITULATE HIS  HYESTO RECAST IN SO HE'S RELAUNCHING IS CAMPAIGN AGAIN THAT STARTED REALLY LAST WEEK THE THE ORIGINAL RELAUNCH IS NOW BEING ESSENTIALLY UNDER POT BY BOTH THE MEDIA AND TEEM TRUMPL GET TO THAT IN ONE SECOND FIRST MATM KNOWS I NEED TOHAVE MY BLACK RIFLE COFFEE EVERY SINGLE MORNING I I NEED IT LIKE MY MY KIDS KEEP ME UP ALL THE TIME ACTUALLY SLEEP TRACKED MYSELF RECENTLY AND I FOUND THAT I'VE NOT HAD MORE THAN SIX IN A HALF HOURS OF SLEEP IN

OFFEES PERFECT FOR PEOPLE WHO NED THEIR COFFEE QUICKLY EACH CONTAINS AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF CAFEEN AND IS S VELBLOIN A VARIETY OF FLAVORS LIKE THE VANILA BOM SALTED CARMEL MOKA AND VANILLA

BLACK RIFLE COFFE DOT COMMYU'S PRUMMICLCHIPIRAGAT TEN PER CENT OFF OCAY SO THER'RE BEEN  SEVERAL SYSTOMIC STRUGGLES FOR THE DISANTUS CAMPAGN I THINK THEY MADE SEVERAL CUART ASSUMPTIONS WHEN THEY JUMPED IN TO TE RACE AND NONE OF THOSE OF COMTRU SO CORASUMPTION NUMBER ONE GOVERNMENTS MATTERS NOPE NOT ONE IOTA NOT IN THER PUBLICAN PRIMARIES O DON'T HIS SIMPLE FACT OF TH MATTER IS THAT RONDISANTIS PASSING A BILL TO STOP CRITICL RACE THEORY IN THE STATE OF FLORA HAS BEEN TREATED BYG RE PUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS THE SAME AS TE VAKUE PROMISE WAMME SAYING THINGS ABOUT CRITICAL RACE THEORY SAYING THINGS AND DOING THINGS IN REPUBLICAN PRIMARY THERE IS NO ACTUAL DISTINCTION AND IS HARD FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN POLITIC TUNDERSTAND BUT IT IS THE REALITY BECAUSE POLTITIONS MA I GET IT POLTITIONS MAKE PROMISES ALL THE TIME AND SO YOU TEN TO BELIEVE THOSE PROMISES IN A PRIMARY IF YOU HAVE NO REASON NOT TO BELIEVE THE PROMISES IN A PRIMARY WHICH IS LI DONNAL TRUMP COULD MAKE PROMISES IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ON ALL SIDES OF A PARTICULAR ISSUE AND BEBERE LIKE OGAWL ETHER TRUST THE GIRY DON'T TRUST THE GUY DESANTIS LIKE YOU SHOULD TRUST ME BEAUSE I DID THESE THINGS IN FLORIDA ND THE R PUBLICAN VOTERS ALIKE WELL I MEAN BUT I COULD TRUST OVAGU MAYBE HE MAYBE'LL DO THOSE THINGS WHEN HE'S SURE I MEAN THETE I'VE NO REASONABLIF HE WON'T DO THOSE THING SO DOING THINGS AND SAYING THINGS IN REPUBLICAN PRIMARY TURN OUT TO BE ALMOST THE EXACTIN THING SO DOSANTIS IS FOCASTALOON GOVERNMENTS IN FLORDA BUT THE GOVERNENTS THAT HE'S FOCASET ON IN THE CAMPAIN HAS BEEN ALL THE SAME STUFF THAT THE VAGUE JUST SAYS AND SO HEASN'T ASSUE WON AND YE ADVANCSAGE OVER SOMEBODY LIKE THE VAKUE BY PASSING A LAW BANDING CRITICAL RACE THEORY IN THE CLASSROOM OVER VIC SAYING HE WOULD DO THAT IF YOURE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES A TO THATTDISTINCTION WHICH I THINK TO SANTUS THAULT WAS GOING TO BE VERY TELLING FOR HIM HASN'T HAD ANY IMPACT ON THE RACE SECOND AS I MENTION THE ELECTABILITY ARGUMENT FOR DOSANTIS WAS ROOTED IN THE IDEA THAT TRUMPLE POBLY POLLLO AND T SANS WOULD PULL BETTER AGAINS BIDON AND THAT HASN'T HAPPEN LARGELY BECAUSE EVERYONE PULLS WELLAGANS BIDON OR LEAST HAFDECENTLY AGANS BIDON TO BINDS A REALLY CRAPPY PRESIDENT AS WE'LL GET TO INJUST A LITTLE WHILE SO THAT'S HURT HIM AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT I THINK THAT DESANTIS TRULY BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE HE HAD SOME CAPITAL IN THE BANK NOT JUST MONEY BUT LIKE ACTUAL POLITICAL CAPITAL ON THE BANK THAT HE COULD THEN NOT GO INTO UNFRIENDLY AREAS AND REITERATES THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WHY HE WAS POPY ON THE FIRST PLACE SO RONDISANTUS IS NOT JUST POPULAR BEAS OF HIS COVERD POLICY RONISANTUBS POPER ON THE STAND OF FLORD BECAUE THE MEDIA MADE HIM ANMY NUMBER ONE AND THEN HE WENT INTO THEIR INTO THEIR SPACES AND HE RECKTS THEM DESANTIS THAT SAID OVER AND OVER NEEDS TO BE DOING THIS I DON'T UNDERSTAND FOR LIFE OF ME WHY HE HAS NOT THUS FAR HE'S BASILY SHIE LED HIMSELF FROM OPPOSING MEDIA I GET IN ON A PERSONAL LOF LET'S NOT FUN TO DO THAT SORT OF STUFF BUT YET YOU KNOW WHO DOES OPPOSING MEDIA FAIRLY FREQUENTLY IS FOVAG YOU KNW WHO DOES SUPPOSING MEDIA FAIRLY FREQUENTLY OR AT LEAST DID DURING THE TWENTY SIXTNT HE DOESN'T DO IT NOW BUT DURING TWENTY SIXTEEN DONAL TRUMP DIT OPOSING MEDIA FAIRLY FREQUENTLY IF YOU WAUNT TO SHOW THE REPUBLICAN BASE THAT YOU ARE A FIGHTER TE SANSUS TINKS YOU DO THAT BY ACTUALLY DOING THINGS AS GOVERNOR AS I MENTIONE NOPE THE ONLY WAY PEOPLE THINK THAT YOUR FIGHTER IN THEREPUBLICAN BASE RIGT NOW IS YOU GO ON MEDIA AND YOU GO TO A MEMBER OF THE MEDIA AND YOU RECK THEM TO THEIR FACE THAT IS THE WAY THAT YOU SHOW THEM THAT YOU ARE FIGHTER DE SANS HAS NOT DONE THIS IN THET CAMPAGN SOFAR SO HE'S NOT REALLY DROPS AND PPOLLS HES STUCK STILL IN THAT FIFTEEN TO EIGHTEEN PERCENT RANGE BUT HE'S NOT BUST OUT IN ANY SERIOUS WAY AGAYSO OVER THE WEEKAN HE UM HE HE BASICALLY WAS LID  A HE HE MADE A COMMENT AH WHILE HE WAS BEING INTERVIEW BY WILWIT THAT SEEMS TO ME IN ARGUABLE IN CONTEXT IN CONTEXTS I DO NOT THINK THIS DIS CANP THIS THIS STATEMEN IS IN ANY WAY ARGUABLE IT WAS THEN IMMEDIATELY TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT BY PRETTY MUCH ALL OF HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS WHICH IS THE WAY THAT IT WORKS IN A CAMPAGN AND USED AS A CLUB TO HIT HIM SO HEROOS TO SANTUS WITH WILL WITOVER THE WEAKEN THESE GODS HAVE RECORDS OF PRINCIPLE FIGHTING THE SWAM THAT ARE SECOND TO NON AND YET THEY WILL BE ATTACKED BY SOME OF THESE PEOPLE AND AN CALLED RHINOS AH SO IT'S JUST BEEN TOTALLY DETACKED FROM ANY TYPE OF SUBSTANCE AND ULTIMATELY A MOVEMENT CAN'T BE ABOUT THE PERSONALITY OF ONE INDIVIDUAL THE MOVEMENT HAS GOT O BE ABOUT WHAT E YOU TRYING TO ACHIEVE ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THAT'S GOT TO BE BASED AN PRINCIPL AH BECAUSE IT YOU'RE NOT ROODED AND PRINCIPLE AH IF ALL WE ARE IS LISTLESS VESSELS THAT JUST SPOSE TO FOLLOW YOU KNOW WHATEVER HAPPENS THE COMEDOWN THE PIPE ON TRUTH SOCIAL EVERY MORNING TH THAT'S NOTKING TO BE ENDURABLE MOVEMENT GAYSO THE BEGINNING OF THIS STATEMEN IN WHICH HE LITERALLY CALLS OUT PEOPLE LIKE THE LYT STOPHANA RIGHT HE'S TALKING ABOUT LEFT WING OR OR PEOPLE WHO ARE LEFT LEANING REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE ALLIED WITH TRUMP AND THEN SUDDENLY BECOME NOT RHINOS AND THEN SHIPROY OF TEXAS WHOSE VERY VERY CONSERVATIVE AND SOMETHING BECOMES A RHINO WHEN HE SUPPORTS TO SANTUS WHAT DO SANSIS SAYING IS THAT CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORTERS WHO SUDDENLY BECOME NOT RHYNOS BECAUSE THEY SUPPORT T TRUMP EVENTHOUG THEY'R LEFT WING ON POLICY OR PEOPLE WHO SIMPLY WILL DO WHATEVER TRUMP ONCE ON ANY GIVEN DAY AS SUPPOSE TO I LIKE TRUMP FOR PRINCIPALED REASONS THETR LOTOF PEOPLE WHO DO OR I I LIKE WHAT TRUMP DID IS PRESIDENT BO PEOPLE DO THAT'S OLED Y'S TALKING BUT HE'S SUNG OUT PEOPLE WHO SHIFT THEIR POSITION ON ANY GIVEN DAY BASED ON WHAT DONOF TRUMPS PREFERENCE IS ARE HE' SAYING THAT IF ANY MOVEMENT THAT ROOTS ITSELF IN FOLLOW THE LEADER IS NOT GOING TO BE A SUCCESSFUL MOVEMENT THAT DOES NOT SEEM PARTICULARLY ARGUABLE TO ME IN THAT CONTEXT SO IMMEDIATELY GET'S TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT AND NOW THE IDEA IS THAT WHAT HE TO BASKET OF DEPLORABLE'S MOMENT LIKE WHEN HILLERY CLINTON SUGGESTED THAT TRUMP SUPPORTERS WERE A BASKET OF DEPALL WHIKE TO PREMISIS TERRIBLE PEOPLE ET CETERA SO THE SUGGESTION IS THAT WHAT DE SANTUS WAS SAYING THERE IS THAT EVERY ON WHO SUPPORTS TRUMP IS E LISTLESS VESSEL WHICH IS CLEARLY NOT WHAT HE IS FATHING THERE RIHT IN CONTAXT HE CLEARLY IS NOT TE THE MATTER YOU'VE GOT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WHICH GAIN THERE'S GREAT IRON TO THE FACT THAT TON TRUMP CAN ATTACK ANYBODY FROM AN ANGLE AT ANY TIME USING ANY TOOL AT HIS DISPOSAL IN EVERYBODY DISCUNI SHRUGS TE SANTIS SAYS SOMETHING THAT REALLY IS NOT AN INSULT AND TRUMP'S CAMPAGN IMMEDIATELY TAKES OF FENCE SO MAGA PUT OUT A UM IN MAGA INK PUT OUT A STATEMENT SANG INSTEAD OF ISSUING AN IMMEDIATE APOLOGY TEEM TO SANTUS SPEN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS DOUBLING DOWN ON HIS INSULT TO TRUM SUPPORTERS RONDO SANTUS SHOULD STOP HIDING BEHIND SPOKESPEOPLE AN ADDRESS THIS HIMSELF EVERY HOUR THAT PASSES FURTHER UNDERSCORES THE CONTEMPT TO SANTOS HAS FOR THE VOTERS WHO MADE HIM GOVERNOR PERHAPS HE'S WAITING FOR ANOTHER MEMBET FROM NEVER BACK DOWN TO TELL HIM WHAT TO DO SO AGAIN THE IDEA IS THAT HE'S INSULTING YOU IF YOU SUPPORT TRUMPEES INSULTING THAT'S NOT WHAT HE'S SAYING THAT'S CLEARLY NOT WHAT HE SAID WE PLAYED THE CLIP THE VA CROMASWAMMY IN VERY CYNTICAL FASHION TO THE SAME THING HE WEATED OUT THE REAL TANGER TROR MOVEMENT IS THE RISE OF LISTLESS VESSEL ROBE OUP POLITICIANS WHO BLINDLY FOLLOW THE COMMANDS OF THEIR SUPERPACKS WHICH IS I I GOT A SAVE THEBATE THAT'S PRETTY DISCUSTING I' GET RONTO SANTUS HAS BEEN THE BEST GOVERNOR IN THE COUNTRY OVERHE LAST FOUR YEARS  SUGGESTING THAT RONDO SANT IS THE LISTLESS VESSEL FOLLOWING A SUPER PACK IS PATENTLY ABSURD IT'S PATENTLY ABSURD THE IDEA THAT CANDIDATES WILL SAY ANYTHING OR DO ANYTHING OR SWITCH ANY POSITION TO GET AHEAD WITH NO CONSEQUENCE IN THAT THAT SOUNDS MORE LIKE UP LISTLESS VESSEL KIND OF TALK I BUT IT'S  BUT IT'S SOM IT'S G ENOU IT'S CAMPAIGN CAMPAIGNSTER UGLY TE SANSIS CAMP FIRED BACK AT ALL OF THIS I THEY THEY PUT OUT A STATEMENT THE A PRESSECRETARY BRANGRIFFIN SAND QHAT THE ISHONEST MEDIA REFUSES TO REPORT THE FACTS DONALL TRUMP AND SOME CONGRESSIONAL IN DORCERS ARE LISTLESS VESSELS WHY BECAUSE TRUMP AND DECY INSIDERS FEEL HE ISN'NTIDLED YOUR VOTE RONDA SANTUS BELESIYOR TRUS SHOULD BE EARNED AND HAS THE VISION PLAN AN REGER TO BETHO BI AN REVERSE THE DOCLINE OF OUR COUNTRY ANZA AN THE HE SAID THAT'S WY ROND SANSEL BE SHOWING UP ONE SONIHT TO DABATE AND TONNEL TRUM WILL NOT HER WHAT AGAIN WE'LL SEE IF ANYBODY ELSE INCLUDING TO SANTUS IS ABLE TO GAIN ANY POINT STRIG THE EBATE SEEMS TO ME THE DYNAMIC IS DEBATE WITH TRUMP ABSENT IS GOING TO BE ALL ABOUT TRUMP IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY'S GONTO TRAIN THER IN COMING FIRE ONTO SANTUS PARTICULARLY CHRISS CRISSY WHO IS JUST A SUICIDE BOMMER IN THESE DEBATES HE WASN'T TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN HE COMMITTED ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST OBVIOUS ACTS OF MURDER SUICIDE AGAINST MARCO RUBIO KILLED HIM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE DEBATE ANZA AND THEN PROSEEDED TO IMPLODE HIMSELF SO NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING  SORT OF DISPOSITIVE FROM THIS TOBATE I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS A I DON'T THING THAT'S PROBABLY RIGHT I THINK THAT THIS DEBATE IS PROBABLY CAN BE EVERYBODY HOLDING THEIR GROUND BECAUSE WHAT GROUND IS THERE TO WHOLD TE MEAN THEIRE FIGHTING OVER THIRTY FIVE PERSEN OFTHER PUBLICAN BASE OF THIS POINT  TRUMPS GOT THE OTHER THO THURDS LOCK UP SO NAN'S CAN BE HIRD TO SEE HOW ANYBODY BREAKS LOOSE FROM THAT PACKS I SUGGESTED LAST WEEK I THINK THIS DEBATE LOOKS MORE LIKE A LOBSTER POT THAN ANYTHING ELSE OUR CRAB POT  EVERY PULLING EACH OTHER DOWN AS THEY TRIED TO ESCAPE THE POT MEANWHILE TRUMP IS SITTING OVER THERE WITH TUCKER CARSON I ENJOYING HIMSELF NO THE THE OTHER CANDIDATES FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH A AR OUR HAVING TEIR OWN STRUGGLES EVERYS FOLKSTONTO SANTUSTIS STRUGGLES CAUSE HE'S WIDELY ASSUME TIN MY PULLING IS THE SECOND MOST PROMINENT CANDIDATE IN THE FIELD EVEN IF HE'S TRAILING BY FORTY POINTS BUT THE OTHER CANDIATES ARE HAVING THER OWN TROUBLES SO THE VAKE ROMISWOMY FR ALL THE TALK IS STILL SIX SEVEN PERCENT THAT IS OUT PERFORMING FOR SHORE VAKE IS VERY AGGRESSIVE HE DOUT ON THE CAMPAGN TRAIL ALL THE TIME HE GOES INTO OPPOSING MEDEO SPACES HE'S VERY CLEVER AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS TURN TO VIK FAVOR IS HE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE DENOMINATE ALMOST UNDOUBTEDLY NOT IT DOESN'T MATTER HE'S MAKE MG NAME FOR HIMSELF WHICH YOU KNOW AGAIN IS PART OF WHAT REPUBLICAN POLITICS HAS BECOME FOR A WHILE I IS HAT IS VERY OFTEN PEOPLE RUNNING FOR OFFICE FOR ANCELLARY REASONS MEANWHILE NICKEY HAYLEY IS STILL RUNNING SHE'S EARNING THREE FOR PERCENT OF HE VOTE SHE IS SHE'S AT LEAST TO HER CREDIT TRYING TO MAKE A CASE AS TO WHY PEOPLE SHOULD MOVE BEYOND TRUMP WHICH I ASSUME THAT SOMEBODY HAS TO MAKE IF THEY DON'T WANT TFROM TO BE THE NOMINATE HERE'S NICKEY HAILEY THE OTHER DAY TRYING TO EXPLAIN MY TRUMPSHOUL NOBYE THE NOMINATE I THINK THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS THE RIGHT PRESIDENT THE RIGHT TIME I AGREE WITH SO MANY OF HIS POLITIES BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE TO WIN AND NOVEMBER AND IT IS TIME TO PUT THAT NEGATIVITY AND DRAM UP BEHIND US WE KAN KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE PASS WE HAD DO TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO TAKE AMERICA TO A NEW FUTURE THAT IS FULL OF PEETH AND LAWN ORDER AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR CHILDREN THAT'S A CASE IS IT GOING TO HAVE AN WAIT I HAVE SOME DOUBTS MEANWHILE THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY HAS THE STRONGEST CASE TO MAKE AGAINST TRUMP ON THE MERITS IS MY PENCE IS VICE PRESIDENT WE DONALD TRUMP LIDE ABOUT FOR THREE MONTHS SUGGESTING THAT HE HAD THE UNILATERAL POWER TO OVERTURN THESE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION BY DENYING STATE CERTIFIED RESULT PENCE WAS WAS AF SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHETHER TRUMP ACTUALLY DECLASSIFIED MATERIALS THAT HE THEN YOU KNOW HAD ON HIS PROPERTY OF MAR LAGO OVER THE WEEK AN A PENCE LIKE LAW I MEAN I DDN'T SE AN EVIDENC HE DO CLASSIFIED

WERE RECOGNIZING THAT THERER MASSIVE ISSUES CLOUDING THE BIDING CAMPAIGN HERE THEY WERE DISCUSSING ON MET THE PRESS I THINK BY HAS BASIS YEAL GOT THREE ISSURES FORE HE 'S NOT FIGOUR OT WHAT THE SA O I WANTIS OVISLY THE QESSNS ABOUT HONTER BY HIS SON THE OTHER IS WHAT THE SAY ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION TI THE DOLLO TROM AND THE THIRDIS ABOUT HIS AGE THOSE ARE THREE HASSOF ISSUES THAT ARE SORT OF CLALI HIS RE ELECTION CAMPA AND HE'S NOT FIRGET ALL THE SAVE OG AND THE O THAT OF COURSE IS TRUE AND EVEN OTHER MEMBERS THE MEDIOT OR NOTICING THAT HUNTER BITIN AND JOBITON ARE LIARS SO FOR EXAMPLE JAK TAPERON CIANNA AN HO'S LIKE YOU REMEMBER THAT TIME WEN JOBITON SAID THAT HUNDRED NOT RECEIVE CHINES MONEY THAT WAS NOT TRUE HESTLER ROTE HUNTER BIDE REPORT NEARLY TWO POINT FOUR MILLION IN INCOME IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ANS WO POINT TWO MILLION IN I COMIN TWENTING EIGHTING MOST OF WHICH CAME FROM CHINESE THREEN GRANIN INTERESS BUT THI AND THIS DIRECTLY GOES AGAINST WHOIT JO BY IN SAD IN THE DEBATE AND TWENTY TWENTY WITH DO DONAL TROM PICKELUS MY SON HAS NOT ME ONEY IN JERMS O THIS FEOR MOUNT AWARDED CARCUR BA CHINA WANT YOU NOT  TA RETERN HE MADE A FORTUNE IN NEW GRAN IN CANA IN MASA SEPELIARYOT OF THE PLAYERS SOAS FROM TWO DIFFERENT GOOD BADES GUD I MEAN TRUMP WAS RIGHT I MEAN HE BOOD MA A FORTUN FROM TANA AND JO BIGON WAS WRONG NOW NORMALLY YOU WOULD CALL THAT JOBIDON BEING A VICIOUS LIAR HE IS A PENNY ANTI CRIMINAL HE HAS BEEN A PENNY ANTI CRIMINAL HIS ENTIRE POLITICAL CAREER W HISN'T HIRCER IS JUST LITTERD WITH HIM OBTAINING GOODES FOR MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY WERE TALKING ABOUT EVERYBODY RANGING FROM IN SISTER TO HIS BROTHER FRANK AND JIM TO HIS SONS BO AND HUNTER EVERY ONE AROUND TOBDON HAS TO COME RICHER BECAUSE JOBIDON WAS IN THE UNITED STATE SENATE THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THIS WELL NOW IT SEEMS THAT THINGS MAY GET UGLY FOR JO  NOT BECAUSE OF THE STUFF THAT HE DID FOR HUNTER BUT BECAUSE O THE ONE TIME HE COULDN'T PULL IT OFF FOR HUNTER ACCORDING TO POLITICO  HUNTER BIDON'S LAWYER IS NOW THREATENING TO PUT JO BIDON ON THE STAND IT WAS HOLLOWEENE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND HUNTER BIDON'S LAWYER CRISS CLARK DIDN'T SAUND HAPPY JUST THREES EARLIER NEWS HAD LEAKD THAT FEDERAL AGENS BELIEVE THEY HAD ENOUGH EVINENC TO CHARGE HIS CLIENT WITH THE LEGALLY BUYING HAD GUN AS A DRUG USER THE LEGALS ILLEGAL THE LAWYER WROTE TO THE USITERNY OVER SEING THE PROBE THE PROSECUTION HE ARGUED WOULD BE SEEN AS PURLY POLITICLE MIHT EVEN VIOLATE THE SECOND MENMENT THEN HE ISSUED WARNING IF THE JUSTISE DEPARTMENT CHARGED THE PRESIDENT SON HIS LAWYERS WOULD PUT THE PRESIDENT ON THE WITNESS STAND PRESIDENT BIDE NOW IN QUESTIONABLY WOULD BE A FACT WITNESS FORED THA OFFENCE IN ANY CRIMINAL TRIAL CLARK WROTE IN A THIRTY TO PAGE LETTER OF YIEWED BY POLITICO THAT LETTER ALONG WITH MORE THANH THREE HNDRED PAGES OF PREVIOUSLY UNREPORTED EMAILSON DOCUMENTS EXCHANGE BETWEEN HNTER BIDONS LEGALTIM AN PROSECUTORS SHUDS NEW LIGHT ON THE FROUGTONEGOTIATIONS THAT NEARLY PRODUCED A BROAD PLEDEO THAT DEA WOULD OF RESOLVED BIDONS MOST PRESSING LEGALISSIOS THE GUN PURCHASE AND HIS FAILURE O PAY TAXES FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND ALSO COULD AVE HELPED INSOLATE BIDON FROM FUUE  FUTURE PROSECUTION BY RE PUBLICAN LED TO JAY THE DOCUMENTS SHOW HOW THE DEO COLLAPSED A SUDDEN TURN ABOUT THAT CARD AFTER PUBLICAN'S BASHION AND A JUDGE RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT IT THE CLAPS RENEWED THE PROSPECT BIDONALL HAD TO TRIAL AS TOS FATHER RAMS UP HIS TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ALECTION BID SO WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED HERE WHELE APPARENTLY THE DOCUMEN'S FROBIDE A DETAILED BEHIND THE SEENE'S LOOK AT HOW THE TWOSIDES CAME TO THE BRINK OF A PLEADEO IT WAS A SWEETHARDEO MO QUESTION BLEW UP WHEN THE JUDGE SAW THE SWEETHART DEAL AND SAID I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING REMOTELY LIKE THIS IT WAS VERY OBVIOUS THAT DAVID WITE AND THE DO J WERE CRAMMING DOWN A SWEETHARTEO HUNTER BIDON WAS GOING TO TAKE THAT SWEETHARDEAL AND THEYWERE DOING ALL OF THIS IN ORDER PRECD JOBIDON FROM HAVING TO TAKE THE STAND OR BE INVOLVED BUT IT WAS JOBIDONS DOJA WHO WAS OVERSEEING ALL THIS OBVIOUSLY ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENTS BY APRIL TWENTY SIX TWENTY TWENTY TO AS THE HUNTER BIDON'S LAWYERS CAN BEN WITH PROSECUTORS THEN ONE BIT CONCERNS TAXES SPECIFICALLY BY THE PROSECUTORS WERE GING TO CHARGE HIM WITH FAILING TO LAWFULLY PAY THOSE TAXES FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN CHARGES RELATED TO ANYTHING ELSE DODN SEEM REMOTELY IMMINENT SPEAKING TO LAWYERS FROM THE DOJA BIDON'S ATTORNEYS OPEN THEIR ARGUMENT WITH TRUMP IN LETTER FROM CEASELESS DEMANDS FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF HUNTER CHARGING THE YOUNGER BIDN WITH TAX CRIMES TOUL BE DEVASTATING TO THE REPUTATION OF TE DOJA ACCORDING TO HUNTER'S LAWYERS IT WOUL LOOKE LIKE THAT APARTMENT HAD ACQUIESCED TO TRUMPS POLITICAL PRESSURE CAMPAIGN SO THE ARGUMENT THAT HUNTER'S LAWYERS MADE TO THE DOJE WHICH THE DOJE THEN TOOK UP REMEMBER THIS IS ALSO NDER DONAL TRUM WAS IF YOU INTERVENE WRIGHT NOW AND YUEFTUALLY PROSCUE HUNTER I MIGHT HURT JO AND THAT WOULD OOK BAD FOR TRUMP WHICH IS AN INSANE REASON NOT TO BRING CHARGES BIDON'S LAWYERS TO ARGUE THE POLITICAL PRESSURE WAS ITSELF A COMPELLING REASON NOT TO BRING ANY CHARGES LATER IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO THE OJ CONFIRMED TO BIDON'S LAWYERS THEIR CLANK COULD ALSO FACE FEDERAL CHARGES FOR A GUN CRIME CLARK ARGUED THE SAME POLITICAL PRESSURE MEN BRINGING GUN CHARGES WOULD BE SCANDALOUS ON OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY THIRTY FIRST TOINT TOINT TO HE WROTE DIRECTLY TO DAVID WEISES THE USA TURNING FOR DELAWARE OVERSEEING THE PROBE WEISE HAD BEEN APPOINTED BY TRUMP HE BEEN ALLOWED TO STAY ON DURING BIDNS ADMINISTRATION TO CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION MERICK GARLAN THE  G A PLICE TO GIVE WEISES FULL INDEPENDANS BUT HE WASN'T GIVEN FUL INDEPENDENCE HE HAD WORK WITH OTHER DAS ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO CHARGE IN VARIOUS TUR SICTIONS CAUSE HE'DN HAVE SPECIAL COUNCIL STATUS CLARK ARGUED IN HIS LETTER TO WEISS THE CHARGING HUNTER BIDE WITH TA GUN CRIME WOULD TORPEDO PUBLIC TRUST IN THE DO JAY THE DOCUMNT INCLUDED COLOR PHOTOES OF TWO FORMER HEADS OF TRUMPS AT DOJ MATWOUOD KER AND BILBAR TALKING BOUT BIDN BUSINESS DEALS ON CABEL NEWS THEN CLARK CAN VOKE ANOTHER CONTROVERSIAL FEDERAL INVESTIGATION HE SAID WAS SEEN BY THE PUBLIC IS A POLITICAL HATCHET JOB THE FAILED PROSECUTION OF PROMINENT DEMOCROTIC LAWYER MICHAEL SUSSMAN SUSSMAN OF COURSE WAS INVOLVED IN THE STEEL DOCIE AND ALL THE REST OF IT CLARK LAYED OUT WHAT COULDHAVE BEN SEEN AS APPROMIISS A WARNING OR SOME VERY ZEALOUS LAWYER ING HE SAID JO BIDEN WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY BE A WITNESS AT TRIAL BEAUS OF LEEKS ABOUT THE PROBE HE WROTE THE JUST A FEW WEEKS BEFORE SENDING LETTER THA HAD BEEN TWO BACK TO BACKLY S RELATED TO HUNTER BIDON AND THE GUN ISSUE CLARKS HAD THE LEEKS PROMPTED THE PRESIDENT TO ADDRESS HIS SON'S LEGAL WOES THE NEXT DAY ON SIANEN AND HE THEN DESCRIBED IN AND NEARLY ON THINKABLESONARIO ACTUALLY CALLING JO BIDON AS A WITNESS AND THAT POINT THE DOJ BASICLLY SAID FINALAT SOLVED THAT LET LET'S LET'S DO AS SWEETHART PLEADEO WHICH IS INCREDIBLE SO BASICALLY HUNTER BIDON'S LAWYERS PRESSUR THE BIDON DOJ INTO GIVING HIM A SWEETHARTDE WITH THE THREAT THAT JOBIDN MIGHT HAVE TO TESTIFY FOR THE DEFENCE TOTALLY INSANE THEN THE WHISTLE BLOWERS CAME FORWARD THEY SAID OA BY THE WAY THIS SWEETHARTDEO AND THEY PREVENTED US FROM INVESTIGATING FULLY AND THAT IS EN ONLY THEN AFTER THAT AND AFTER THE COLLAPS OF THE PLEEDEO THAT IS WHEN THE DOJA DECIDED TO MAKE DAVID WEISS A SPECIAL COUNCIL TO INVESTIGATE PRESUMABLY PARTIALLY HIMSELF BY THE WAY WORTH NOTING HERE WHO EXACTLY IS DAVID WEISE WELL TURNS OUT THAT DUM DAVID WEISE WORKED FOR YEARS WITH BO BIDEN BECAUSE HE'S FROM DELAWARE DELAWAR'S VERY SMALL STATE EVERYBODY KNOWS EACH OTHER WEIES WORKED WITH BO TO HASH OUT PROSECUTION STRATEGIES ALTHOUGH DEMO CRAT'S POINT TO WICE'S APPOINTMENT BY DONALD TRUMP IS EVIDENCE OF HIS INDEPENDENCE THE FULL STORY OF HIS CAREER IS MORE NEWONS HE SPENT TWO YEARS ZACTING YOS O TURNING UNDER BAROCHAMAMA AND JOBIDON AND THEN REMAINED AS TOP DEPUTY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THEIR TERM SO THAT THE NOTION THAT IT WAS LIKE TRUMPS DECISION TO A POINT WEICE AND HE OUL AV FIRED EM PRESUMABLY BUT VERY OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS LET YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT KNEW WHO DAVID WISE WAS OF COURSE NOT HE OUGT RECOMMENDATION FOM PEOPLE AN DELAWAR DAVID WEISES  GOOD GUY SO HE JUST REAPPOINTED HIM THE WIDE HAS TO CLINED TO COMENT NOTING THAT WEISE'S CONDUCTING IN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION PRESUMABLY INTO HIMSELF CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT WESE IS THE PERSON WHO NEGOTIATED THE SWEET HAR ITDEAL IN THE FIRST PLACE THIS IS GOING TO GET VERY VERY UGLY VERY QUICKLY FOR HUNTER FOR JOE FOR EVERYBODY ELSE IN VOLVE MEANWHILE JOBIDON CONTINUES TO BE THE WORLD'S MOST TERRIBLE PRESIDENT OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE STILL MISSING TWO WEEKS AFTER THE WILD FIRES IN MALL THAT INCLUDES PRESUME WE HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN WE WE HAVE NO IDEA EXACTLY HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT TAT JOBIDON  WENT WEST FOR HIS SECOND VACATION OF THE MONTH WHICH IS REALLY

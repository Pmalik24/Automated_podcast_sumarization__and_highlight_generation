DONALD TRUMP LEAPS TO A TEN POINT LEAD OVER JOBIDON IN T LATEST WASHINGTON POST POLE GENERAL MARKMILLY FINALLY LEAVES AND SENER BOBMANANDA'S WONT COE EVEN IF YOU FIND BARS OF GOLD UNDER HIS BED I VENTURFUR THIS IS THE VENCH PERO SHOW THE BENCHVAR SHOS MONTERBA EXPRESSIVE THE PIAN PROTECT OUR ON MINE PRIVACY TODAY AT IF PRESUPIAN DI COM FLASH MEN OF THE BIG E ARGUMENT AGAINST DONAL TRUMP AS THEIR PUBLICAN NOMINY HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN THAT HE IS UNELECTABLE THAT'S BEEN THE ARGUMENT AGAINST HIM BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY HE LOST TO JOBIDON INTO THOUSAND TWENTY HE DIDN'T WHEN THE POPULAR VOTE AGAINST TILLER CLENT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND SQUEAKED OUT A WIN AGAINST HER IN THAT ELECTION CYCLE AND THUS GOING UP AGAINST JOBIDON AGAIN HE IS GOING TO HIT THE SAME CEILING THAT HED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY WHICH WIS ABOUT FORTY SIX PER CENT OF THE VOTE BUT IF THE POLE STARK TO SHOW THAT DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY DOES NOT HAVING CEILING AT FORTY SIX PER CENT INSTEAD HIS CEILING IS FIFTY OR FIFTY ONE THE ELECTIBILITY ARGUMENT AGAINS DONAL TRUMP GOES COMPLETELY AWAY WILL NOW WE HAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME A POLE SHOWING DONAL TRUMP BREAKING DAT GLASS CEILING ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON POST OVER THE WEAKEN THIS POLE SHOWS DONAL TRUMP OVER OVER JOBIDON BY TEN POINT THAT IS AN AMAZING POLE INFACTED SUCH AN AMAZING POLE AT THE WASHINGTON POST AS ALREADY LABELED INTO OWN POLE AN OUTLIER SAYING THAT HOEU CAN TAKE A POLE THIS IS TRUE YOU CAN TAKE A POLE AND SOMETIMES THE SELECTION OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE POLE IS A LITTLE BIT WEIRD AND SEEGETN OUTLIER POLE BUT THE PROBEM IS THIS EVEN IF THE POLE IS OFF BY MARGIN OF ERROR FIVE SIX SEVEN POINTS THAT WOULD DEMONSTRATE THAT TRUMP IS STILL RUNNING DEAD EVEN WITH JOBIDON WHICH AGAIN UNDER CUTS THE UNELECTABILITY ARGUMENT AGAINST DONALD TRUMP ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON POST BIDEN AND FORMER PRESEDENT TRUMP APPEUR HEADED FOR REMATCH OF THEIR TWENTY TWENTY CONTEST AL THEGH MORE THAN THREE AND FIVE DEMOCRATS AND DEMOCRATIC LEADING INDEPENDENCE SAY WOULD PREFER NOMINY OTHER THAN THE PRESIDENT BUT BIDNS AN BISERS HAVE ARGUED HES STILL THE STRONGEST DEMOCRAT FOR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT ALL THIS BAD POLLING FOR BIDON IS LEADING UP TO AN ATTEMPT TO DEFENI STRAIHT BIDON TO GET RID OF HIM TO TOSS HIMOUT WINDOW TO FIND SOMEBODY ELSE WHO CAN REPLACE HIM PRESUMABLY THAT WOULD NOT BE ONE OF THE CANDIDATES WERE CORNELTLY TALKING ABOUT YOU COULD SEE A SITUATION IN WHICH MICHELL OBOMA PARISSUTES IN FROM THE RAFTERS IN ORDER TO SWEEP UP THE NOMINATION BY A CLAIM ONE THING IS FOR CERTAIN TJOBIDON RUNNING THIS WEAK AGAINST DONAL TRUMP IS HORRIBLE FOR THE PROSPECT OF JOBIDON IS THE ACTUAL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR NOW MANY ACCORDING TO THE POST AB SEA POLE IT CHOS BIDON TRAILING TRUMP BY TEN PER CENTAGE POINT BUT THEN THE WASHING POST POLIFIES THAT EAVE THE SIZEABLE MARGINAN TRUMPS LEADIN TE SURVEY IS SIGNIFICANTLY AT OBS WITH OTHER PUBLIC POLES THATH SHOW THE GENERAL ELECTION CONTEST A VIRTUAL DEAD HEAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS POLES AND OTHERS AS WELELS THE UNUSUAL MAKE UP OF TRUMP AND BIDENS COALITIONS IN THE SURVEY SUGGEST IT IS PROBABLY AN OUTLIER AGAINST THE WASHINGTON POST UNDER MINING TUM POLE NI'M NOT GOING TO DO THE POLE UNSKEWIN WHAT I WILL POINT OUT IS THAT THIS IS THE SECOND PRESEDENTIAL POLE IN THE LAST THREE THE CHOS DONAL TRUMP WITH AN ATUAL SIZABLE LEAD AGAINST JOBIDON THE THE LAST POLE BEFORE THIS WAS AN ENBYSENEWS POLE THAT CHOWED THEM TIED AT FORTY SIX PER CENT THE POPE FOR THAT WAS A POLE FROM THE MESSENGER HAIRISACTS WHICH SHOWED TRUMP UP FIVE IN FACT THERE IS NO POLE WITH JOBIDON UP MORE THAN ONE PER CENT IN THE LAST ONETH AND A HALF EVERY POLE HAS YEITHER TRUMP UP ONE OR BIDEN UP ONE OR THEIR TIDE THE MESSENGER HARIS EXPOLE HAS TRUMP UP FIVE NOW THIS WOULD SUGGEST THERE'RS STILL A SIZABLE UNDIVIDED POT UNDECIDED POPULATION THAT IS OUT THERE AMMUR'S GON TO READ YIOU THE LATEST POLES IN THIS IN THIS PERTICULAR MATCHRUP ABE SNES WASH POST TRUMP PLUS TEN AND BE SENES TIE THE MESSENGER HERRISAC TRUMP PLUS FIVE EMERSON YAHONES MORNING CONSUL TIE TIE TIDE HARVARD HERRIS TRUMP UP ONE HARVARD  ERASPESAN REPORTS TRUMP UP FOR RASMESON REPORTS BIDEN PLUS ONE ECONOMIST YOU GO BIDING UP ONE FOX NEWS TRUMP UP TO TO ANOTHER WORDS IT'S EITHER MARGER OF ERR OR TRUMP UP THAT SEEMS TO BE THE THE PULLING TREN AND THAT IS DIFFERENT THEN IT WAS JUST A FEW MONTHS A GO A FEW MONTHS AGO THERE IS A SUGGESTION THAT THAT ACTUALLY BIDIN HAD A PRETTY SIZEABLE LEAD IF YOU GO ALL H WAY BACK TO JULY QUINNIPIA HA BIDIN UP FIVE YE HAD YAHONES WOULD BIDIN UP FOR IF YOU GO BACK A LITLEFOR THAN THAT GA WHONUS HAD BITIN UP SEVEN BUT BOTOM LINE IS THIS S A VERY COMPETITIVE RACE AND THE REASON TIS IS COMPETITIVE RACE IS BECAUSE JOBIDE IS A TERRIBLE PRESIDENT WHY YOUR SEING IN THIS POLE IS HURRIFIC NUMBERS FOR JOBIDON JOBIDINS JOB APPROVAL RATING RIGHT NOW ACCORDING TO THIS POST EABY SENES POL IS THIRTY SEVEN PER CENT FIFTY SIX PER CENT DISAPPROVE IN THAT THAT IS THAT'S AN AMAZING AT THIRTY SEVEN PER CENTS APPROVAL RATING FOR THE SITTING PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES AS FAR AS THE STATE OF THE NATIONS ECONOMY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT BELIEVE THAT IS EXCELLENTS ARE GOOD COMPARED TO SEVENTY FOUR PER CENT TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT SO GOOD OR POOR THIRTY FIVE PER CENT BELIEVE THAT THE UNIMPLOYMET RATE IS EXCELLENTS ARE GOOD COMPAREDTO FIFTY SEVEN PER CENT WHO BELIEVE IT IS NOT SO GOOD OR POOR ON FOOD PRICES NINETY ONE PER CENTS OF PEOPLE BELIEVE IT IS NOT SO GOOD OR POOR BIDON HAS TERRIBLE RATINGS ON THE ECONOMY AND EMOGRATION AS WELL ON THE ECONOMY THIRTY PERCENTS APPROVAL RATING IN NEMOGRATION TWENTY THREE PER CENT APPROVAL RATING NOW AGAIN THERE'S SOME ASPECTS OF THIS POL THAT AR I WOULD SE VERY DUBEOS  IN TERMS OF WILL THAY HOLD UP FOR A GENERAL ELECTION JUST BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE UNPRECEDENTED NAGAIN MAYBE THE REAL BUT IF THEY ARE NOT REAL THAT WOULD NOT BE A SHOCK EITHER BECAUSE AGAIN A LOT OF THESE NUMBERS ARE QUITE SHOCKING FOR EXAMPLE THIS POLE SUGGESTS THE DONAL TRUMP ONLY LOSES MY NORTY VOTERS BY NINE POINTS NOW TO BE FAIR BIDING ONE THE NON WHITE VOT IN IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY BY FORTY FIVE POINTS SO YOU'D HAVE TO ASSUME EIGHT THIRTY SIX POINTS CHANGE IN MYNORITY VOTES BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY AND TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY FOR THREE YEARS AGO BIDING ONE VOTERS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY NINE BY FIFTEEN POINTS IN THIS POLE TRUMP LINDS THOSE VOTERS BY SIXTEEN POINTS THAT IS A THIRTY ONE POINT SWING MEANS ARE MASSIVE HUGE ENORMOUS SWINGS THAT POLE SHOWS UNBELIEVABLE SWINGS TOWARD TRUMP AS POINTED OUT BY ISAC SHORE WRITING FOR MEDIIDE IT SHOWS UNBELIEVABLE TWINGS TOWARD TRUMP AMONG INDEPENDENTS PLUS TWENTY SIX RORAL VOTERS PLUS TWENTY SIX MODERATES PLUS TWENTY TWO URBAN VOTERS PLUS FOURTEEN BUT HERE'S THE THING EVEN IF THIS POLE IS A REALLY BAD OUTLIER THE PULLING FOR JROBIDE RIGHT OUT IS JUST TERRIBLE A CROSS THE BOARD IT'S TERRIBLE REMEMBER DOMALTRUMP IS ONE OF THE SINGLE MOST UNPOPULAR POLITICIANS IN MOUR AMERICAN HISTORY AND HE'S RUNNING DEAD EVEN WITH A GUDE THE MEDIAT CHOSE AND HAVE COUTED AS HE NEXT COMING OF FTIAR THAT SAYS SOMETHING BUT HOW BAD JOBIDON IS AS A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND DEMOCRATS ARE GETTING READY TWO HIT THE PANIC BUTTON NOW THEY CAN'T SAY THEIR HTTING PANIC BUTTON THIS IS THE WEIRD PART THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BASE DOES NOT WANT YOBIDON THREE IN FIVE DEMOCRATIC VOTERS DO NOT WANT YOBIDN BUT THE DEMOCRTIC YOU LEAD UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT COMES ANACES IN ALL OUT WAR WHICH IS WHY YOU HAVE THE USELESS SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION PEOPLE TO JUDGE WHO AGAIN WHEN O'N PATERNATY FOR TWO MONTS NOBODY NOTICE P BUDJEDGE IS IS NOW ATTEMPTING TO AVOID THE IMPLICATIONS O THE BULL WHICH THE JOBIDON PROBLI SHOULD STEP ACIDE IF HES COMPETITIVE ADONAL TRUMK THE POLL THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT HAPPY WITH PRESIDENT BIDL FLEEDERSHIP ON A RANGE OF TOPICS AND ISSUE SO WHAT DO YOU SAY THAT THE FORTY FOR PER SENT OF

EASILY WIN SEVEN EIGHT PER CENT OF THE VOTE AND THAT COULD MEAN THE DIFFERENTE FOR JOBIDON FOR SHORE AND THIS IS ALL BECAUSE JOBIDON IS TERRIBLE AT THE JOB NOW WE' WE'VE BEEN ASSUMING ALL LONG THET TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IF IT'S BETWEEN TRUMP AND BIDON IS CAN BE REFRED AMON ONE OF THE TWO AND THE SAFE ASSUMPTION IS THAT I WAS CAN BE REFEREN IMON TRUMP BECAUSE TRUMP OBVIOUSLY SUCKS UP THE HEADLINES

MOMINE EVERYBODY SNAPS BACK IN A PLACE IN THY SAY WE HAVE TO THEY SAY WE HAVE TO STOP TRUMP THAT OF COURCE OS WHAT JOBIDON IS BETTING ON WHAT'S AMAZING TO ME THOUGH IS THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS WILLING TO BET ON JOBIDON IN THIS RACE AGAINST TONAL TRUMP AND THERE BUNCH FEATHER CANDIDATES FOR SITTING ON THE SILANS THE PROBLEM IS THAT THAT SAMEET WASHINGTON POSTBOLL SHOWS THAT THERE IS NO CONSENTS IS BACK UP TO JOBIDON IF JOBIDON STEPS OUT GOT COMELA HERS LIKE EIGHT PER CENT GET P BOODY JECTE LIKE SEVEN PER CENT THERE'S NO ONE OUT THERE WHO CONSOLIDATES THE BASE THIS WY SUGGEST THAT THE  CAN WILD WILD CAR DEERY IS MICHELOBOMUB COMING IN FROM THE WINGS RIDING A UNICORNER SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT IS WHAT DEMOCRATS PROBLY ARE HOPING FOR AT THIS POINT BUT AGAIN JOBIDON HE'S A DESPERATE CANDON HE SHOULD BE A DESPERATE CANDIDATE BECAUSE HE IS HE'S GOT PROBLEMS THIS IS WY HEIS NOW PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS AT THIS POINT ON THINGS LIKE THE ECONOMY SO JOBIDON IS TRYING TO SHORE UP HIS UNION SUPPORT HE'S GETTN GO TO THE PICKET LINES APPARENTLY IN WANE COUNTY MICHIGAN ACCORING TO SANNEN YU A W UNION PRESIDENT SHON FANE WILL JOIN PRESIDEN JOBIDEN ON THE PICKET LINE TUESDAY AND WANE COUNTY MICHIGAN ACCORDING TO A SOURCE FAMILIAR AT THE SITUATION THE SOURCE PROVIDED NO S PECIFICS ABOUT THESE ACT LOCATION THE W A W HOWEVER IS NOT INVOLVED THE FORMER PRESIDEEN TRUMPS PLAN VISIT ON WEDNESDAY NOR HAVBEEN IN CONTACT WITH HIS TEAM SO TRUMP APPARENTLY IS GEN A SKIP THAT SECOND PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY DEBATE AND CALIFORNIA WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN ON WEDNESDAY AND HE'S EXPECTED TO ALSO HEAD TO MICHIGAN TOAD DRESS THOSE UNION WORKERS NOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE TRUMP TEAM WORKED HARD ON IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THEY TRIED TO MAKE REACH OUT TO A LOT OF THE ROUS BELT WORKERS IN THAT MENS GOING AND MAKING OVERTURES TO MANY OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR UNIONS NOW PUBLICSECTOR UNIONS BUT PRIVATE SECTOR UNIONS LIKE THE U   NOW TO BE COMPLETELY FAIR TO THE AUTOMAKERS WHAT DO YOU A W WIS ASKING FOR IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS IS TOTALLY WHILE MEAN ASKING FOR A THIRTY TWO HOUR WORK WEEK AND DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS WHICH IS WHAT BASILY BANKRUPT TO THE CAR COMPANIES IN THE FIRST PLACE IS A NON STARTER BUT IN TERMS OF THE PURE POLITICS OF THE SITU ATION DONAL TRUMP AGAIN THIS IS WHAT MAKES DONAL TRUP OF FORMIDABL KANTIDATE IS THAT DONALD TRUMP IS WILLING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY OPENIN RAT DOES NOT MATTER FROM WHICH SIRECTION HE WILL HEU WILL TAKE YOU FROM THE LEFT HE WILL TAKE IT FROM THE RIGHT BECAUSE HE DOES NOT ACTUALLY HAVE A SET OF COR PRINCIPALS NONAL TRUMP THIS MEANS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMPLL ILL COME ET JOBIDON FROM THE LEFT HEU WILL TRY TO EDGE HIM OUT OF HIS UNION SUPPORT WITH THE U A  THIS NOW HAS FORCED JOBIDON TO GO TO THE PICKET LINES IN MICHIGAN TO TRYIN SHORE UP THAT YOU A  U SUPPORT THAT' TITSHAPPENING RIGHT HERE ACCORDING TO SIANEN NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE STRIKING YOU A  ON FORT REMAIN VERY ACTIVE OVER THE WEEK END AND ON MONDAY BUT THEY'RE STILL SOME DISTANCE ON KEY ISSUES MEANWHILE THEU A UBL YOU SAYS IS EXPANDING IT STRIKE AGAINST GM AND STO LANTAS BUT SAIDE PROGRESS AN NEGOTIATION WITH FORD MEANS IT WON'T EXPAND THE NUMBER OF FOUR WORKERS ON THE PICKET LINES NOW AGAIN THE FACT THAT BIDON IS HEADED TWO THE PICKET LINES IS PRETTY SHOCKING FOR THE SETTING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO ACTIVELY TAKE FIGHT IN  TAKE SIZES IN A LABOR DISPUTE THAT HE HIMSELF IS EFFECTIVELY CREATED THROUGH HIS ELECTRIC VEHICAL MANDATES WHICH IS WHAT ALL TESE CAR COMPANIES ARE LOOKING AT N FREAKING OUT ABOUT TBECAUSE THEY MAKE ALL THE MONEY OFF GAS POWRD ENGENS AND NOW THE'REBEING TOLD THEY ED TO GO TO SIGNIFICANTLY LESS ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENTS E VS AN THESE COMPANIES ARE SELLING THREE PERCENT OF THEIR TOTAL GROTHS IS EVES RIGHT NOW THERE BEING TOLD THEY NEETSTO SHIFT COMPLETELY OVER TO EVS AN NEXT FEW YEARS AND MUMA GOT THE U A U AS PRESSURING THEM FORA BIGGER SHARE OF THE PROFITS WHICH THRIGIN A NEED NOR TO MAKE THAT EVY SHIFT THEY'RE STUPETIN A ROCK IN A HARD PLACE CREATED BY JOBIDON AND NOW JOBIDON IS TAKING SIDES WITHE U A U AND THE MAN IS REALLY A BAD PRESIDENT HE'S A TRULY TERRIBLE PRESIDENT AND THE FACT THAT HE LEFT THE OR OPEN TO DONALD TRUMP TO SWOOP IN AND TROUND GRAPS OM YU A  SUPPORT IS PRETTY AMAZING NOW WHAT'S EVEN MORE AMAZING IS HOW JOBIDONS ECONOMIC POLICIES HAV EXASTRBATED ALL READY PRESENS STURIOUS PROMENSY IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IN FLATIONARY POLICY OF JOBIDON HAS ARE Y EXASCURBATED A LABOR SHORTIS THAT IS BEEN GENERATED BY THE DEMOGRAPHIC COLLAPSE OF THE WEST IN JENERAL GET TO THAT MOMENTARILY FIRST WELL VALOT ON OUR SCENTULS OF HOW MUCH WE HAV TO DO EVERYDAYS GOT SOCK OR PRACTICE CIENCE FERS PREPPING FOR THE HOLIDAYS COT PICG UP MY KIDS ALL THE RESTFIT THE GOOD NEWS IS YOU CAN TAKE A BIG THING OFF YOUR PLAYT BY PUTTING GREAT MEAT ON YOUR PLATE WITH GOOD RANCHERS YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY EATS WHILE GENES SO TO THE FOLKS OVER GOOD RANGERS THAT'S WHRE THEY'VE SPENT YEARS BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS OF LOCAL FARMS TO SORCE THE BEST ON HUNDRED PER CENT AMERICAN BEEF CHICKEN PORK AND NOW WILD CAUGHT SEEFLOOT AS WELL THE BEST OF THE LAND AND SE YOU CAN NOW GET CONVENIENTLY DELIVERED TO YOUR DOOR RIGHT NOW THER OFFERING TWO YEARS OF FREE GROUND BEEF TO ANYBODY WHO SUBSCRIBES THAT IS A FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLAR VALUE THAT 'S TWO YEARS OF FREE HIGH QUALITY GROUND BEEF IN A LOCKIN PRICE NO OTHER MEAT COMPANY GUARANTEES YOU ONE HUNDRED PER CENT AMERICAN MEAT AND A LOCK IN PRICES CAUSE NO ONE ELSE'S GOOD RANCHERS HE INSAVE ON YOUR BEEF CHICKEN AND PORT LOCKING N YOUR PRICE TO DAY EVERY SINGLE

SUBSCRIBE TO ANY BOX TO LOCK INTER PRICE ON AMERICA'S BEST MEAT FOR TWO WHOLE YEARS AS WELL THAT IS GOOD RANCHER'S DOT COM TODAY YUSE MACOBEN THERE WERE FIVE HUNDRED BUXS AN TAKING SUBSCRIBES TO GOOD RANCERS AMERICAN MEATS DELIVERED KAS SO THE JOBIDEN ECON OMIC POLICY IS CREATING SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAT THETE ARE ALREADY EXASCURBATED BYDEMOGRAPHIC PROBLEM THAT UNDERGIRDS THE ENTIRE WESTS ECONOMIC STAGNATION AND HANS FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS ACCORDING TOTHE WALSTER GERNAL THE USE ECONOMY HAS BEEN RUNNING IN PROBABLY WITH AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE UNDER FORKPER SENT FROR NEARLY TWO YEARS THIS ISN'T JUST TO HOLD OVER FROM PANDEMIC PODLENICTS WHEN EMPLOYERS THAT MILLIONS O PEOPLE GO AND THEN STRUGLE TO FIND WORKERS TO COME BACK IT'S A STORM THAT HAS BEEN BREWING FOR DECADES FLOAING AT MOST RECENTLY IN THE FORM OF WORKER STRIKES AT AUTOMAKERS AND AIR LINES WLABOR SHORTAGES ARE TURNING INTO A LONG FROM LABOR PRICES THAT COULD PUSH WAGES AND TURNOVER HIGHER IT TURNS OU THE WHEN YOU INFLATE THE CURRENCY IN THE MIDDLE OF THA SITUATION DEMOGRAPHICALLY OR RUNNING OUT OF YOUNG WORKERS WELL YOU OT THAT'SGOIN TO DO IT'S IN CRATE LABOR SHORTAGES WORK EXPERTS HAVE WARNED FOR YEARS THE COMBINATION OF BABY BOOMERETIREMENTS LOW BERTH RATES SHIFTING EMOGRATION POLICIES AND CHANGING WORKER PREFERENCES IS LEAVING YU US EMPLOYERS WITH TWO FEW WORKERS TO FILL JOB OPENINGS WHILE THE LABOR MARKET IS SOFTENING NONE OF THOSE FACTORS ARE EXPECTED TO CHANGE FROMATICALLY IN THE COMING YEARS TOTAL EMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN GROW ABOUT ZEROPOING THREE PER CENT TA YEAR UNTIL TWENTY THIRTY TWO ACCORDING TOTHE LABOR DEPARTMENT TAT IS MUCH SLOWER THAN THE ONE POINT TWO PER CENT RTE OVER THE PASTECADE THAT IS LARGELY BECAUS THE POPULATION CONSTRAINTS AND THAT'S GOING TO LEAD TO SLOWER GROWTH IN G T P SO PRODOCTIVITY IS PROBABLY GOING TO DROP EX GAN YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH YOUNG WORKERS WERE COMING INTO THE WORK FORS BECAUSE BABY BOOMERS DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH BABIES THE JUST BIRTH RAT AS BEEN FALLING FOR DECADES TO CLINING BY ABOUT HALF SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES SO WHEN YOU IN FLEATE THE CURRENCY IN THE MIDDLE OF A WORK OR SHORTIGE WHAT YOU WENT UPLYTH IS WAGED SPIRALS WHICH MEANS PRICE SPIRALS WHICH MEANS WAGE SPIRALS WHICH MEANS E ECONOMIC STAGNATION IT ALL OF THIS HAS BEN EXASCURBATED BY AGAIN THE GARBAGE POLICIES OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION EVERYBODY KNOWS IT EVERYBODY CAN FEEL THE STAGNATION AS IT BENSANG FOR A WHILE I DON'T THINK THAT INFLTION S ACTUALLY THE LONG FROM THREATS OF THEAMERICAN ECONOMY STAGNATION IS LONG FROM THREAT TO THE AMERICAN ECONOMY THIS BY THE WAY HAS ONE OF THE REASONS YOU WOULDIMAGION WYJOBIDON IS ACTUALLY VERY LAYSA FAIR ABOUT OUR BORDERS BECAUSE WHEN YOU REALIZE MERICA HAS A DEMOGRAPHIC PROBLEM THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH YOUNG WORKERS AND WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT THE SOLUTIONS TO THAT DEMOGRAPHIC PROBLEM WOULD BE TWO FOR EXAMPLE RAISE THE RETIREMENT AGE THAT THE SOLUTIONS O THAT DEMOGRAPHIC PROBLE TO BE TO STOP INFLATING T THE CURRENCY THAT THE THE ACTUAL SOLUTION TO ALL THESE DEMOGRAPHIC PROBISES TO INCREASE PRODOCTIVITY BY ALLOWING THE INNOVATIVE PEOPLE IN TH UNITED STATES TO ACTUALLY INNOVATE AND MAKE MONEY OFF OF IT AS PPOST TO REGULATING THEM OUT OF EXISTENCE ON BEHALF OF GOVERNMENT REDISTRIBUTIONISM WHEN YOU REALIZED THAT YOU WOULN'T HAVE TO HAVE AN OPEN BORDER BUT IF YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP ALL THOSE BAD POLICIES AND PLACE IN NEED A FRESH SUPPLY OF WORKERS WERE YOUCAN GET THAT FRESH SUPPLY OF WORKERS WHILE JOBIDONING COMPANY THEY KNOWWHERE AND THE ANSWERS SOUTH OF THE BORDER WHICH PRESUMABLY IS WHY THE CUSTOMS AN BORKER PATROL HAS TOLD FOX NEWS THAT HERE ARE PROXIMATELY ELEVEN FOWSIN MIGRANT IN COUNTERS AT THE SOUTHWESTERN BWORDER IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS MARKING THE SINGLE HIGHEST DAY IN RECENT MEMORY THERE NOW PICTURES EMERGING FROM THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF SMALL CHILDREN CRAWLING TROUGH BARBED WIRE TO GET INTO THE UNITED STATES I DON'T SEE ALEXANDERO COSOPROTES DOWN ATE WORDER PROTESTING THE BORDER POLICIES MEANWHILE J JOHNSON THE FORM ER HOME LAND SECURITY SECRETARY NO RIGHT WINGER HE'S OUT THERE SAYING AT THE NUMBERS ARE GINGTG ET HIGHER AND HIGHER THE ADMINISTRATION GORTER BREAK AND MAY EVERY ONE WAS EXPECTING LARGE NUMBERS AFTER THE END OF TITLE FORTY TO BUT THE EMPESISE THERE WAS A RY WAY IN A WONG WAY TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY I HAVE THAT IS WELL IN SUPPLY IN A PROPER WAY THUSE THE A GOIG TO REAGHON A PROCESS ING SENTERS AND THE MIGRANTS AND THE SMUGGLERS OF NOW FIGURED OUT THAT THAT THAT THAT THOSE THINGS DO NOT ARE AT NOT ABLE T ANDLE THESE NUMBERS INSOTHE WORKING AROUND THIS SYSTEM AGAIN AND SO I'M WORRIED THAT THESE NUMBERS GOING TO GET HIGHER AND HIGHER MARCH EIT PROTEND TO BE THE PEAP MONTHS IF FERE SEEING THESE KINDS OF NUMBERS IN SEPTEMBER OCTOBER I THINK WE'RE IN FOR A REAL NESS THERE'S A REASON WHY JOBINES ABUVLERATING ON THAT THE BORDER IS IN THE TWENTIES IN THE TWENTIES WHICH MEANS A HUGE NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS DON'T LIKE HOW HE'S ACTING BOUT THE BORDER EITHER AND THE MEDIA PRATORIAN IRON OCAN WIL PROTECTIM ON US JIMICOSTA HAT ON A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS PERSON TALKING ABOUT THE BORDER AND AT IS RALPH NORMAN REPUBLICAN AND A AND HERE IT IS JIMICOSTA TRYING TO SOMEHOW DEFEND JOBIDANS OPEN BOR POLICIES AND WEL YOU AGREE WITH IT OR NOT THE DOING IT FOR POWER WHY ARE THEY GIVEN SO SECURE TO WHAT  MEAN BY THAT WHY WHY WHAT IS IS A THEIR INTENTIONALLY INTENTINALLY DOING WHAT WHERE'S YOUR EVIDENCE OF THIS WERE'S YOUR PROOF OF THIS JUST HOWS LIKE YOUR THOLOWINGS A NE IRIC AROUND THERE WERE NO BASIS IN FACT A A YOU CAN ITHAVE YOU BEEN ON THE BORE OF COURSE I HAVE AND YOU SEEN WAT'S GOING ON THE RITE THE YA IS I SOPONE MAD NOBODY CAN CAN DENY THAT BORDERS AND A THEY GOT AT THIS SARCRISES WHERE I'LL ASK THE QUESTION SIR AND THE WEARGER IS NOT OPEN THAT IS THAT IS SOMEE THAT THAT IS A PEDTLE AS A TALKING POINT IS NOT TRUE THER THEIR OFFENCIS THEIR WALLS A A THERE ARE BORDER POTRO AGIENS O AN WER O AN BORDER O CAN MEANWHILE WE'RE HAVING TENS OF DOUSANDS OF ENCOUNTERS LIKE PRETTY MUCH EVERY WEEK AND WHEN HE SAYS THE WORS NOT OPEN HE DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S NO ONE ACTIY PTROLING TH BORER WHE MEANS IT THAT EVEN PEOPLE AT PORTS OF ENTRY ARE BEING GIVEN NUMBERS ND THEN RELEASE INS THE INTERIOR OF THE UNITED STATES AS FAST AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE WHY WON'T WEN RALPH NORMAN SAYS ITS FOR POWER THAT'S KIND OF TRUE IS ALSO BECOMES AGAIN THE ECONOMIC POLICIES OF THE NEMOCRATIC PARTY REQUIRE CHEAP LABOR THAT CHEAP LABOR HAS TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE BECAUSE IT ISN'T UN TO COME FROM AMERICAN LABOR BECAUSE THEY KEEP DRIVING UP THE INFLATION THAT KEEP DRIVING UP THE WAGE PRICE AND THEN THEY FILL IN THE GALOP INTRMS THE LABOR SHORTAGE WITH WAIT FOR IT ELEG LITTLEGRANS BALET IS THE HAW THE INTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RUNS IF YOU EVER SPENT ANYTIME IN CALIFORNIA WHAT YOU KNOW IS THAT IT'S VERY RICH PEOPLE HIRING I LEGAL EMIGRANTS TO RAISE THE CHILDREN AND THAT THAT IS HALF THE LOST HANSHCLUS TO THEIR CLEANING THAT TAT THAT LITERALLY IS WHAT IS HAPPENING WE ARE ONEOF THE FEW PEOPLE MEAR NALLAY WHO INSISTED ON ACTUALLY HIRING PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEGAL STATUS IN THE UNITED STATES BUT HOLLYWOOD IS ENTIRELY IT IS ENTIRELY PEOPLED BY EXTRAORDINARILY WEALTHY PEOPLE WHO HIRE I LEGAL EMIGRANT ANTIES TO WATCH THEIR KIDS BECAUSE THAT IS THE MODEL SOCIETY THAT THE LEFT IS SEEING TO CREAT ISHOUT REDISTRIBUTIONIST IN THE LIGHTEST IN THE END WHAT T ACTUALLY IS IS FINDING IN NEW LABOR BAS TO SUPPORT THEIR WAY OF LIFE TO SUPPORT THE DECLINING POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES THE IDEA IS THE BRING IN CHEAP LABOR AND THAT'S THE DEAL LEAVE THE BOAR OPEN THE BOR OPEN AND THAT THAT'S HOW YOU SUPPORT YOUR POLICIES SOS ON THAT TO BRINGING ALL TESE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY WANT THEM TO VOTE EVENTUALLY THEY HOPE FOR THE OLD VOPE THAT 'VE ET NOPP AN AMNISTY GET EDS THAT IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THEIR CRAP ECONOMIC POLICIES THEY HAVE TO HAVE A CHEAP LABOR BASHER IN THE UNITED STATES THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THAT IS TO IMPORT CHEAP LABOR THAT'S AND PEOPLE MOWIT WHICH IS WHY PRESUMABLY JOBIDEN'S ECONOMIC POLICIES ANDISMOGRATION POLICIES ARE WILDLY UNPOPULAR AND JUST THE SECON HENE GET TO THE QUESTION OF IF IF JOBIDON AN SO ON POPULAR WY ISN'T DONAL TRUMP

RIGHT NOW ALL THE FOLCUS IS ON BIDIN BECAUSE FRANKLY'S SBEN A FEW WEEKS SINCE AN INVENTMENT CAN DOWN FOR TRUMP LUST BE REAL ABOUT THIS EVERY TIME TRUMP IS IN THE NEWS AND THE INDICTMENT IS IN THE NEWS HE TENDS TO DROP IN THE POLES AND THEN EVERY TIME EN SIMEN IS NOT IN THE NEWS PEOPLE FOCUS IN ON  JOBIDON SO IN AN ELECTION CYCLE IN WHICH HE IS GOING TO BE IN CORT NO LESS THAN FOUR TIMES ON CRIMINAL

WITH OUT THE CRAZY IT'S STILL PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND DONALD TRUMP POLICY WITHOUT THE CRAZY COULD BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AGAIN BECAUSE IF YOU JUST LOOK AT HOW THE CONTRY WAS RUNNING WHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS PRESIDEN FOR IS HOW IT IS NOW RUNNING OR NOT RUNNING UNDER TOBIDON AT AS A PRETTY CLEAR AND CONVINCING CASE FOR REELECTING DONAL TRUMP AGAIN DONALD TRUMPS BEST ELECTION PLAY IS LOOK AT HOL THINGS WERE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN THEN WE GOT HIT WITH WITH PANDEMIC BUT EVEN WIT THE PANDAMIC THE ECONOMY WAS ALREADY SCY ROCKANING OUT O THE PANTAMIC BY THE TIM I LEFT OFFICE AR THAT IS HIS BEST CASE IS BEST CASEIS THINGS RAN GRATE UNTIL HE GOT HIT BY AN EXTRANEOUS EVENT AN THAT  AND AND JOBIDON HASN'T HAD ANY OF THOSE YOR BEN YS HAD THE BENEFIT OF BASICALLY LOWAL PIECE EXCEPT FOR YOU CRANEWICH WL ATTO IN A SECOND HER HE'S HAD THE BENEFIT OF OF A VAXINE PLAN AND ROLL OUT THAT I CREATED HE HAD THE BENEFIT OF AUR RECOVERING ECONOMY AND HE BENEFIT OF ALL THESE THINGS AND SOMEHOW HE'S RUN THE ECONOMY DIRECTLY INTO THE GROUND AND MANS LESS SAFE LOBALLY SO VOTE FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN RIGT THAT TDATWOUD BE DONAL TRUMPS CASE HAT'S PRETY GOD CASE THAT THE PROBEM FOR TRUMP A GAIN IS GOING TO BE HIMSELF THE ONLY PRERSON WHO CAN RELYT IF HE TRUMP HIS TRUMP NOT BIDON IT WAS TRUWING TWENTY TWENTY IT'S TRUE AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AS WELL SO THE LEFT IS GOING TO TROT TRY TO FIND REASONS TO FOLK SENTRUM NOW I WI'LL SAY THAT THERE IS ONE OTHER BENEFIT TO FOR THATR TRUMP HAS HERE AND IT'S THE SAME BENEFIT HE'S HEDSINCS TWENTY SIXTEEN I SAID THAT IN TWENTY SIXEEN THERE IS NO WAY FOR HILLERY CLINTIN TO SULLY DONAL TRUMPS SKIRT BECAUSE HE WAS MADE OF MUD SO ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT POLITICS IS THA HAT YOU TRY TO DO AS YOU TRY TO MAKE YOUR OPPONENT LOOK WORSE WHAT THE PROBEM IS THIT THOW THAT WORKS IF YOU'RE HELLERY CLINTONIN YOU'R TRYING TO PORTRAY YOURSELF AS CLEAN AS THE DRIVEN SNOW AND DONALD TRUMPIS THRUNG MUDDY YOU IT'S ALL GON

THI'S BAKED IN TO THE CANKE I DON'T HINK THAT THIS SORT OF RETERIC CHANGES THINGS FOR TRUMP AT ALL THERE CERTAIN THINGS HE CAN SAY THAT I THINK MAKE IT WORSE FROMMOUTING THIS IS ONE OF THEM I THINK THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS COURTS IN TH UNITED STATES ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW DONAL TRUMP TO PUT COM CAST OUT OF BUSINESS OR ANYTHING REMOTELY LIKE THAT I ALSO THINK THE VAST MAJORITYOF AMERICANS DON'T TRUST THE SO CALLED LEGGACY MEDIA FURTHE THEM THEY CAN THROW THEM THEREON'T TRUST THEM AT ALL SON THE WHITE HOUSE TRIES TO YIS SORT OF SCHOOL MARM TRUMP ON THIS IT DOESN'T WORK SO OVER THE WEEK EN THE WHITE HOUSE PUT OUT A STATEMENT SUGGESTING THAT THE DONAL TRUMP WAS THREATENING DEMOCRACY N QUOTE ON THE RECORD FROM ME PRESIDENT BITIN SWORN OATHS TO UT PULL THEIR CONSTITUTION PROTECT AMERICAN DEMOCRACY FREEDOM OF THE PRESS A FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT SO ABUSE PRESIDENTIAL POWER AND VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF REPORTERS WOULD BE N OUTRAGEOUS O TACKAR DEMOCRACY IN THE RULE OF LAW PRESDENTS MUST ALWAYS TO FIN AMERICANS FREEDOMS NEVER TRAMPLE ON THEM FOR SELFISH SMALL AND DANGEROUS POLITICAL PURPOSES NOW AGAIN THIS SCHOOL MARMING AP PROACH TRUM ANKON A WORK THIS IS NOT GOING

THE PRESS REALLY ARNT ON THE RIGHT THAN ON THE LEFT IF YOU LOOK AT THIS PULL FROM REAL CREPOLITICS BRANNUWPOLE IT SHOWS THAT NEARLY ONE THIRD OF DEMOCRATIC VOTERS THIRTY FOUR PER CENT MORE THAN ONE THIRD SEY AMERICANS HAVE QUOTE TOO MUCH FREEDOM COMPARED ONLY FIFTEEN PER CENT OF REPUBLICANS MEANWHILE WHEN READ THE STATEMENT I DISAPPROVE OF WHAT YOU SAY BUT I WILL DEFENDS OF DEATH TO RIGHTS TO

FOOLSOCIAL MEDIO POSTS ONLY FIFTY PER CENT OF REPUBLICANS FEEL THE SAME DEMOCRATS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY THAN REPUBLICANS TO STATE IT TO FAVOR STIFLING FREE SPEECH RIGHTS OF POLITICAL EXSTREMISTS NOW THIS IS THIS IS NOT A SHOCK SO AGAIN WHEN WHEN THEY TRY TO SCHOOLMARM TRUMP ON O MY GOSHIES AF THRATS OF THE PRESS AND DEMOCRACY AND FREE SPEECH IN ALL THIS THE TRUTH IS THAT IT'S IT'S THE LEFT THAT IS CONSTANTLY A THREAT TO THES SORT OF STUFFS THAT THAT DOG JUST ANKAN OHUNT WILL GET TO MORE ON THIS IN JUST SECOND FIRST ARE YOU A FEW YEARS OR DECADES OUT OF SCHOOL AND WONDERING WHAT THE HECTAT I EVEN LEARN WHAT WAS THE POINT OF ALL THAT SCHOON YOU MGHT THINK YOURSELF AND O'VE TIME TO LEARN SOMETHING WELL IF THAT'S YOU THEY'RE NOT ALONE IT'S NOT TOO LATE AND A NOT EVEN TRUE SINCE

THE FIFTEEN WEEK MARK ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL IT WE MIGHT PENCIS SAID INSTEAD TRUMP BECAUSE AGAIN HE WILL ATTACK FOM ANY ANGLE CAUSE HE HAS NO COR PRINCIPLES HE SAYS PRO LIKEFORS HAD ABSOLUTELY ZERO

CONSTANTLY STRAYING INTO INTO POLITICAL TERRITORY MILLY IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE I'VE SOMETHING ALLOWED MY SOLDIER FRIENDS TALK ABOUT WHCH I AT THE TOP LEVELS OF T PENSIGON BRASS OR POLITICAL ACTORS NOW THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SEEZS THEM AS PREDOMINENTLY SOLDIERS BUTNEST NOT TRUE YOU BECOME A POLITICAL GENERAL VERY OFTEN BY BEING A GOOD POLITICIAN THAT IS HOW YOU RISE THROUGH THE RANKS AND PRETY MUCH ANY ARMY BECASE AGAIN ANY BURACRACY IN SENSE BI PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR TO GET TO THE TOP OF THE BURACRACY AND THAT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE WITH REGARD TO MILLY WHO VERY OFTEN DID SHIFT WITH WHICH  WHATEVER WAY THE WINDS WERE BLOWING AND MEANWHILE THE UNITED TATES SENTAT JUS CONTINUES TO BE MOST ISELY I I SAID BEFORE THE UNITINATIONS IS MOSIZELEY BUT APPARENTLY U AN U SENATE ALSO IS MOSISLEY MAN WE REALLY HAVE JUST A STELLAR GROUP OF PEOPLE OVER IN THE USENATE WE HAVE JOHN FEDTDERMAN WHO IS NOT FUNCTIONAL WE HAVE DION FINSTEIN WHO IS DEAD AT THIS POINT WE HAVE BOBANENDE WHO APPARENTLY WAS TAKING BRIBERY IN THE FORM OF GOLD BARS UNET THET IS ACTUALLY BEYOND PARODY AT THIS POINT ACCORDING TO THE ASSOCIATEO PRESS BOBANENDAS OF NEW JURSY WAS CHARGED ON FRIDAY WITH SECRETLY AIDING THE AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENT OF EGIPT AND TRYING TO THWORT THE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION OF A FRIEND AND EXCHANGE FOR GOLD BARS AND CASH UNDER A AN A CORRUPTION INDICTMEN THA ACCUSES HIM OF USING HIS FOREIGN AFFAIRS INFLUENCE FOR PERSONAL GAIN MANENDAS WAS FORCED TO RELINQUISH HIS CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE SENTAT FORM RELATIONS COMMITEE HE SAID HE IS NOT GOING TO RESIGN FROM CONGRESS THE INDICTMENT IS THE SECOND IN EIGHT YEARS AGAINST THE SIXTY NINERAL SENTER AND ON ALLEGES IN LEGAL COMINGLING OF MANENDAS HIS OBLIGATIONS TO AVANTOS PRIORITIES AND HIS PRIVATE INTERESTS AND CULTIVATING RELATIONSHIPS WITH WEALTHY BUSINESS MEN IT ALSO INCLUGE US CHARGES AGAINST HIS WIFE AND THREE NUGERSY BUSINESS MEN WHILE AUTHORITIES SAY SHOWERED THE COUPLE WITH MONEY GOLD AN LUXURY CARN EXCHANGED FOR OFFICIAL FAVORS WELL I'MEAN LI IMAGINE IF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAD A SON WHO IS TRAFFICING WITH U CRAN CHINA ROMANIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES PING UP SACTS OF CASH AND HIS FATHER WAS BICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES PRESIDING WOR POLICY IN MANY OF THESE MAYTAT WOULD BE TRULY BAD A'M GLATISTUS TO SENTOR A PREVIOUS INDICTMENT OF MANENDAS SENMING FROM DIFFERENT ALLIGATIONS ENDED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WITH THE DEADLOCK JURY NOW GAN THIS IS THE SECOND ATTEMPT TO TO GET BOBANENDAS ON SIMILAR CHARGES ACCORDING TO THIS INDECTMENT FROM AT LEAST TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY TWO MANENDAS AN HIS WIFE ACCEPTAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND OF DOLLARS AND BRIBES RANGING FROM GOLBARS FOR MERCADE'S BENS FROM THREE BUSINESS MEN TO PROTECTON IN RICH THEN AND BENEFIT THE GOVERNMENT OF EGYPT THE LAST TIME ANENDAS WAS INDENTIN TWENTY FIFTEEN WHO AS CHARGED WITH RECEIVING GIFTS AND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CAMPAGN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM AUFLOR TO IDOCTOR SALAMAN MELGAN AT HEPED HIM GET REELECTED TO THE SENATE IN TWENTY TWELVE MANDAS WAS ACCUSED OF USING HIS OFFICE TO PROMOTE MELLIGANS BUSINESS AND PERSONAL INTRISTS WITH OFFICIALS OF PRESIDENT BAROCABOM IS ADMINISTRATION MANENDAS SAID THAT THE MONEY AND THE GIFTS LIKE LUXURY TRAVEL STEM FROM THEIR FRIENDSHIP RATHER TAN CRIMINAL RELATIONSHIP THATTA ENDED IN A MISTRIAL SO JURES ARE GN TO HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER MANENDAS ACCORDING TOU USSAY TO DAY CAN SEPARATE THE GIFTS AND PAYMENS FROM ANY ACTIONS HE TOOK ACCORDING TO LEGAL EXPERTS SO THE THE ARGMENT IS CON O BE THAT HE WAS JUST TAKING GIFTS FROM FRIENDS AND HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIS ACTUAL POLICY HOWEVER THE TIMEMING OF THE GIFTS ARE PRETTY CONSPICUOUS IN THIS CASE APPARENTLY THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO THERE CAN HAVE TO PROVE THAT ALL THESE PAYMENTS BASICALLY WERE IN RETURN FOR INGS OR PROMISES TO DO THINGS MANENDAS FOR HIS PART O SAYING HE IS NOT GOING TO IN AND BY THE WAY WY WOULD HE M WHA WHELL WAN IS THE POINT OF HIM RESIGNING HE HE SAYN H'S NOT UNERS TIMEJUST WONDERING WHY ANYONE WOULD THINK HE'S GOING TO RESIGN IN PASTIMES IN BETTER TIMES AMERICAN PROLITITIONS WOULD RESIGN WHEN FACE WITH SCANDAL THAT'S NOT HOW IT GOES NOW NOBODY NOBODY LEADS OFFICE AT THIS POINT WHY SHOULD THEY IF YOU LIVE LONG ENOUGH THEN EVERYBODY DOES FORGETS ABOUT ALL THIS SO HERE'S MANENDAIS CLAIMING THE PROSECUTORS GETT WRONG IN THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CASES THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR O REVERED JUSTISYSTEM WE CANNOTSET ASIDE THE PRESUMPTION OF INICENCE FOR POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY WHEN THE HARM IS IRREDICABLE TO THOSE WHO HAVE RUSHD TO JUDGMENT YOU HAVE DONE SO BASED ON A LIMITED SET OF FACTS FRAMED BY THE PROSECUTION TO BE A SELACIOUS AS POSSIBLE REMEMBER PROSECUTORS GET IT WRONG SOMETIMES SADLY I KNOW THAT ANDW I MEAN IS NOT CLEAR O THE ACTUALLY GOT WRONG IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN I WILL POINT OUT THAT IN TWENTY SENENTYEN THE PROSECUTION T AT CAME DOWN O MANENDAS IT STARTED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT WAS LARGELY BECAUE A PRESSIOR BROUGHT BY THE ABOMAN ADMINISTRATION AGAINST MANENDAS TO TRY TO GET HIM TO SIN ONT THE RONDIO THERE WAS OBVIOUS POLITICAL MANEUVERING WITH REGARD TO MANEND AS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN HANGING THAT THREAT OVER HIS HEAD YN UPCAVING ON THE ARONDIO BY THE WAY NOW MANY DEMOCRATICS SENTRS ARE CALLING FR HIM TO SET DOWN THAT INCLUDES FETTERMEN INCLUDE SENATORS SHARED BROWN OF OHIOSAND OR PETER WELCHO VERMONT WHE NOBODY'S EVER HEARD OF NANCY BLOWS THE ACTUALLY SAID THAT SHE THOUGHT THAT MANENDAS WOULD SHOULD PROBABLY STEP ASIDE AT THIS POINT MANENDASIS EXCUSED BY THE WAY FOR HAVING GOLBARSLIK SDASH UNDER IS MET IS PRETTY AMAZING I WILL ADMIT THAT THIS IS THIS CIN HILERIOUSLY OUTUM FOR THIRTY YEARS I HAVE WITHDRAWN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN CASH FROM MY PERSONAL SAVINGS ACCOUNT WHICH I HAVE KEPT FOR EMERGENCIES AND BECAUSE OF THE HISTORY OF MY FAMILY FACING CONFISCATION AND CUBA NOW THIS MAY SEEM OL FACTION BUT THESE WERE MONEYS DRAWNG FROM MY PERSONAL SAVINGS ACCOUNT BASE ON THE INCOME THAT I HAVE LAWFULLY DERIDE OVER THOSE THIRTY YEARS OH SO IM BY THE WAY THAT DOESN'T SPEAK AS HIDELY GOVERNEENCS TO NEW JURSHAS HO WOULD THINK IT IT WOULD HE'S LITERALLY SAYING THAT HE HID BARS OF GOLD IN HIS HOUSE BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID THAT THE AUTHWORD ERS BEN COMBURSTING INTO HIS ROOM IN THEMIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO TAKE AWAY HIS MONEY LIKE THE WOULD IN CUBA IM YE SOUND HONESTLY A LOT LIKE CUBAN REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY AT THIS POINT THAT THAT'S WHY YOU WOULD VOTE FOR A SMALLER UNLESS IN TRUSIVE GOVERNMENT IS NOT WHY YOU OULD BE A NEW JERSEY DEMOCRAT WHO ALLEGEDLY TOOK BRIBES THIS SORS NOT BY THEWAY HAS PRESIGNIFIGANT RAMIFICATIONS FOR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR BECAUSE I REMEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEX AND REMEMBER THERE IS A A RE REPUBLICAN A MARK FOLY AND MARK FOLY WAS MESSING AROUND WITH SOME THE MAIL PAGES AND AN END UP HAVING SIGNIFICANT RAMIFICATIONS FOR DEMOCRATS ELECTORAL VICTORY IN THE TWO THOUSAND SIX CONGRESSIONAL LECTIONS A GENERALIZED PERSEPTION OF CORRUPTION INSIDE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY RANGING FROM THE HUNTER BIDAN SCANDAL TOO BOMANENDAS HE'S CAN HAVE SEVERE RAMIFICATI ANS FOR DEMOCRATS LIKE A CROSS THE SCALE WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY DEMOCRATS ARE TARTING TO SAY THEMANEN AS HAS TO GO ALLSO ITS TO SAFE IT'S A SAFE PLACE THIL MURPHY IS THE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY HE'S A DEMOCRAT IF THAT A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR WHICH ITALMOST WAS I ASSUME MANY FEW ER OF THEM WOULD BE CALLING FOR HIM TO GO MEANWHILE A HUMILIATING VISIT TO CANADA BY PRESIDENT VLODAMER I ZOLENSKY OF U CRANE ZOLENSKI HAS BEEN STEPPING ON A LOTITOS AND BECAUSE HE THINKS THAT HE HAS THE MORAL HIGHGROUND WITH REGARD TO RUSSIA AND I THINK THAT HE DOES BUT BECAUSE OF THAT HE THINKS HE APPARENTLY HAS UNLIMITED ABILITY TO SAY PRETY MUCH TO ANYTHING BOUT ANYBODY REMEMBER A YEAR AGO HO'S RIPPING ON THE ASRALIES AND SUGGESTING THEIR NOT DOING THEIR MORAL DUTY BY NOT SHIPPING IRON DOME TO U CRANE AS THOUGH IT WAS ISRAEL'S DUTY TO DEFEND U CRANE AND WHO'S RIPPING ON AMERICA FOR NOT PROVIDING ENOUGH SUPPORT IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT'S AMERICA'S DUTY TO DEFEND U CRANE BUT HERE'S THE DEAL I AGREE THAT THE WORLD SHOULD MOBILIZE ON BEHALF OF U CRANE IN THE INITIAL TERM IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE TERRITORY THAT THEY ARE T HE HAD I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS THE DUTY OF THE WORLD TO CONTINUE TO FUND A WORLD WARD ON STALE MATE THAT DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE ANY SOLUTION AND THEN TO BASICALLY SUGGEST THAT ZOLENSKY CAN NEGOTIATE IS ON TICKET HERE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT LOGIC AT ALL I' BEEN SAYMEG THE SAME THING FOR A YEAR ON THIS WAR HA THING THATIAVE BEEN SAYING FOR WELL OVER YARNS WERE LIKEA YEAR AND A HALF AT THIS POINT ON THIS WAR IS THAT THERE IS NO REASON WHY EXACTLY ZOLENSKI SHOULD BE TH ONE MAKING THE NEGOTIATION HERE WERE THE ONE SIGNING THE CHECK THERE SHOULD BE A BACK CHANNEL THAT'S HAPPENING BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND ROSSIA AND BASICALLY WHAT IT SHOULD BE SAYING IS YOU GOS GET PART THE NONBASSI GETS KEEP CRIMEA THE THE EUKRANIANS ARE NOCKIN T ENTERNATO BUT THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE SECURITY GUARANSKI'S FROM THE WESTIN CASE OF A FUTURE INVASION AND THAT'S THE DEAL AND THEN KRAMADOWN ONSOLENSKY TELLS E LENSKY THE THAT'S TE DEAL AND THEN HE GO BACK TO IS OWN PEOPLE AND HE CAN SAY WHAT HE HAS TO SAY WHICH IS I DIDN'T WANT THAT DEOL THEY MADE ME TAKE THAT DEAL SO IT WASN'T MY RESPONSIBILITY I WANTED TO GO ALL THE WAY THEY WOULDN'T LET ME GO ALL THE WAY HE GETS TO RETAIN HIS POPULARITY WIT HIS OWN PEOPLE THE WAR ENDS AND EVERYBODY GOES HOME I THAT THAT THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THIS GON O END ANYWAY AND YET ZOLENSKI IS YOU KNO AGAIN I MIT MY SYMPATHY FOR ZOLENSKI ON A PERSONAL LEVEL IS STARTING TO WANE AS HE BECOMES MORE AND MORE BRAZEN ABOUT HIS WILLINGNESS TO SIMPLY RANNALLY CALL OUT COUNTRIES AS THOUGH THEY OWE HIM SOMETHING SO HE GOT HIMSELF IN ALL SORT TO HOT WATER IN POLAND RECENTLY ZOLENSKY HAD OFFERED A VAILED CRITICISM OF POLAND AT THE UEN GENERAL ASSEMBLY SAYING THAT DISPUTE WITH POLITICAL THEATERE BETWEEN POLAND AND EU KRANE AND SOME OUR FRENDS IN EUROPE HAVE ADE A THRILLER FROM THE GRANE WELL WHY WAS THIS APPARENTLY IT'S BECAUS THERE IS A BAND ON EUKRANIAN KRANE TOSE PUT IN PLACE BY SEVERAL UNATIONS TO PRTECT THE LIVELIHOD OF LOCAL FARMERS THE R WORD

GET REAL TIRED OF IT REAL FAST ALLRIGHT TIME FOR SOME THINGS I LIKE AND THEN SOME THINGS THAT I HATE SO THINGS THAT I LIKE TO DAY I TOLK LITTLE BABOUT YOM KEPOR SO YOM KIEPOR I  MOMENT FOR JEWISHBRAC YON KIP WAR IS THE HOLIEST DAY OF THE YEAR IN JUDIISM WE CELEBRATED ON MONDAY I'M OVER HERE IN ISRAEL AS YOU CONCEIVE FROM MY BACKDROP FOR THE HIGH HOLIDAYS ANDA IT'S AMAZING HERE I WILL SAY THAT THERE IS SOMETHING TO THE IDEA OF A RELIGIOUS BACKDROP TO ANY COUNTRY THAT I THINK IS GOOD THIS LIVE SUGGESTED FOR A LONG TIME THAT EVERYBODY IN AMERICA SHOULD GO BACK TO CHURCH CINEGOGMAS LI AMERICA OUGHT TO RE RE ROOT ITSELF IN JUDAO CHRISTIAN VALLEYS PARTICULAR CHRISTIAN VALLEYS IN AMERICA BECAUSE THERE CAN BE NO COUNTRY WITHOUT A SOCIAL FABRIC AND THE SOCIAL FABRIC IN ISRAEL AND YOM KEPR IS OBVIOUS THE SYNEGOG THAT I WENT TO ACTUALLY THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTRY I'S A CURZOG WAS THAT THAT PARTICULAR SINEGOG SHER WITS HIS SECURITY AND THEN HE STA LITERALLY ALL DAY PRANE AN NOT LIKE NOWLIC A GRIPPIN GRIN THESE NORMALLY SEE BY POLITICIONS IN THE UNITED STATES WERE THECHURK TO CHURCH FLIKE SEVEN MINUTES AND THEN THEY SAY A COUPLE PERSON THEY LEAVE HE WAS THERE LITERALLY FROM EIGHT THIRTY IN THE MORNING UNTIL TWELVE THIRTY N THE AFTERNOON AND THEN HE CAME BACK FOR MENCAN ELAMARIV WHICH IS LIKE THE LATE AFTERNOON SERVICES EVENING SERVICE HE WAS THERE FROM LIKE FOUR THIRTING THE AFTERNOON TILL SEVEN AND THE ENTIRE COUNTRY BASICALLY SHUTS DOWN INCLUDING MANY OF THE SECULAR AREAS IN ISRAEL F YOUR TELL OF YOU WHICH I T VERY SECULAR AREAN ISRAEL EVERYBODY IS STILL WRITING BICYCLES SOCIAL FABRIC IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT THAT'S ONE THING TO KNOW THING NUMBERED AND IN SOMETHING WE OUGHTO REBUILD IN THE UNITED STATE THING NUMBER TO IS THAT YONG KIPOR IS A REMINDER THAT REPENTANCE IS A CORPS VALUE SO YONGKIPOR IS THE AY AT WHICH YOU REPENT OF YOUR SINS BEFORE GOD GOD KNOWS THE IGNICENT AGAIN BUT YOU REDEDICATE YOURSELF TO HIM AND HIS VALUES AND THE IDEA IS THAT YOU ARE SAYING TO GOD THAT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DO THIS THING ANY MORE LEFT WING THEOLOGY RELIES ON THE IDEA THAT YOU ARE NOT WRONG GOD IS WRONG THAT YOU WILL NOT ONLY SIN GOD WILL FORGIVE OU YOUR SINS EVEN IF YOU HAVE NO INTENT OF STOPPING THE SIN AND NOT NOT ONLY THAT IF YOU EVER REPENT OF YOUR SIN AND MOVE AWAY FROM YOUR SON THIS MAKES YOU A HYPOCRITE BECAUSE WE CAN ALWAY SIHT SOMETHING YOU DID TEN YEARS AGO IS YOU SUGGEST THAT YOU HELD SOMETHING DIFFERENT TEN YEARS AGO HYPOCRISY IS THE WORST ARGUMENT IN POLITICS PERHAPS YOU HAVE JUST REPENTED REPENTANCE IS A GOOD THING IT IS A VALUABLE THING IT IS AS NECESSARY THING IN FACT REPENTANCE HAS THE WORDS SUGGESTS EVEN IN ENGLISH REPENT RT YOU'RE GOING BACK TO A THING REPET IN HEBREW IT IS TISSHUEVA WHICH MEANS TO RETURN SO WHAT AR YOU RETURNING TO YOUR RETURNING TO VIRTUE THE NATURAL INCLINATION OF MAN IS BAD BUT MAN ALSO HAS GOOD ASPECTS TO HIM AND THE THING THAT MAN IS SEEKING IS WHAT THE STATE SHOULD BE WITH REGARD TO GOD WHICH IS ALLEGIANCE TO GODESS WHEN YOU RETURN TO THAT IT IS NOT THAT YOUR EMBRACING SOMETHING FULLY NEW IT'STHAT YOU'R EMBRACING SOMETHING FULLY OLD AND WHEN YOU MAKE THAT REPENTANCE THEN YOU MERIT LIFE THAT THAT IS ESSENTIAL THE ARGUMENT OF YONG KIPOR IT'S IT'S QUITE A BEAUTIFUL DAY IT'S HARD A MINUTES IT'S IT'S A FASTTATE IN JUDISM THE WAY WE FASTLER'S A TWENTY FIVE HOUR FAST AND FASTING IN JUTIESM IS NO FOOD NO WATER SO IIT CAN GET YOU RELATIVELY DIFFICULT IN TERMS OF YO SORT OF WHAT FOR PRETICALY OLDER PEOPLE IN AND VERY VERY YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE YOURS IF YOUR BOYERS PES START FASTIN WHEN OUR THIRTEENT FOR GIRL AS WELTH AND SO I CAN BE PRETTY HARD ON PEOPLE BUT IT IS IN AMAZING EXPERIENCE AND REMINDER THAT IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO TO DO REPENTANCE OK A TIME FOR A QUICK THING I HATE NOW SPEAKING OF A A CULTURE THAT IS COMPLETELY UNREPENTANT OF ITS SIN SO GOOD NEWS AGH VIO MAX NOW CALLED MAX HAS A FULL FRONTAL NEW DATING SHOW IS GOING TO BE A THING NOW SO CORING THE HOLLOWAD REPORTER IT'S LIKE BEING ON TINDER BUT SO MUCH HORSE ONE OF THE OU CASE MOST INFAMOUS DATING SHOWS WAS QUIETLY ADDED TO THE MAX STREAMING SERVICE LAST WEEK IT'S ALREADY CAUSING QUITE A STUR THE STREAMER HAS IMPORTED SIX SEASONS OF NAKED ATTRACTION A GAME SHOW THAT PROMISES YOU START WERE A GOOD DATE OFTEN ENDS NAKED IN EACH UPISODE A SINGLE CHOOSE OR CRETIX AN ELIMINATES SIX PETENTIAL DATES STANDING ON STAGE BY SCRUTINIZING THER FULLY NEW BODIES WHICH ARE GRADUALLY REVEALED ONE PART AT A TIME FACES REVEALD LAST WHEN ONLY TO POTENTIAL DATES REMAIN THE SHUD R STRIPS OUT OF THEIR OWN CLOSE TOO GIVING THE REMAINING TO CONTESTINCE THE OPPORTUNITYTO CRETICUE THEM THE FINAL COUPLE THAN GOD ON A DATE WIT THEIR CLOSE ON SO IT INCLUDES FULL FRONTA NUDITY IT CAN COME ACROSS AS DRAW DROPPINGLY BRUTAL IN THE CONTESTAN'S GRAPHIC AND ALISIS I DON'T LIKE HER FEET HIS MEMBER IS TOO SMALL AT T HE SAME TIME YOU HIPSTOD CONTAINS INTERSICIALS OF INFORMATIVE SEX EDUCATION THE SHOW CLEARLY TRIES TO PROMOTE BODY CONFIDENCE AND POSITIVITY THN THET ALL THE HOT OR NOT JUDGMENTS THE SHOW ALSO INCLUDES CONTESTANCE A DIVERSE SEXUAL ORIENTATIONS HOW HOW DELIGHTFUL HOW DELIGHTFUL SO WE ARE NOW SUPPOSED TO YOU JUDGE PEOPLE NOT AS FULLY FLEDGED  HUMAN BEINGS WE ARE NOT UPPOSED TO JUDGE EACH OTHER ANDIS IS THE NATURAL OUTCOME OF A HETANISTIC SOCIETY IN WHICH THE ONLY THING THE MATTERS IS IS SEX THE SEX INSTINCT IS THE ONLY THING THE MATTERS IT TURNS OUT THAT THE WAY WE USED TO DATE IT HONESTLYIS AMAZEMENT THE WAY THAT WE USED TO DATE IS THAT YOU DIDN'T TAKE YOUR CLOSE OFF UNTIL YOU ARE MARRIED THAT'S WAY WE USED TO DATE IN SOCIETY SOME OS CO STILL DATE THAT WAY WHEN THAT WAS THE CASE YOU HAD TO FULLY APPRECIATE THE PERSONS SITTING ACROSS THE TABLE FROM YOU AS A FULLY FLEDGED HUMAN BEINGS WITH THOUGHTS AND VALUES AND IDEAS AND THEN LATER YOU GOT TO THE SEX NOW  GET TO THE SEX FIRST AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS KINDED BY THE WAYSID THERES BENAS BIG ARGUMENT GOING ON ON LONE IS REALLY WEARD ARGUMENT THAT'SBEEN GOING ON INCLUDING SOME SORT OF ANTIPHEMINUS ON ON THE RIGHT SUGGESTING MARRIAGE IS BAD BECAUSE NO FAULT DIVORCE IS LED TO MOST DIVORCEIS BEING INITIATED BY WOMEN WHICH MEANS S RISKY FOR MEN TO GET INTO A MARRIAGE MY ANSWER TO THAT IS NOT IF YOU MARRY THE RIGHT WOMAN AND THE WAY THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE MARRYING THE RIGT WOMAN OR LEAST HAVE PREGOOD SECURITY IS IF YOU DATE IN THE RIGHT WAY NOT ALL MARRIAGES ARE CREATED EQUAL IN TERMS OF THEIR QUALITY AND NOT ALL PARTNERS ARE CREATED EQUAL IN TERMS THEIR QUALITY THIS IS WHY 'S VERY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU ARE DATING DO NOT DO THE NAKED ATTRACTION VERSION THE FIRST DATE GET IN T SACK SEE HOW IT GOES FROM THAT THAT IS NOT HOWDATING SHOUL GO IT SHOULD BE PRECISELY AS IT WAS IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY APPRECIATING THE OTHER HUMAN BEING

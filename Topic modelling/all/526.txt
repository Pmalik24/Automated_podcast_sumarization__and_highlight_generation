WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LA SCIENCE SCIENCE TAS TON  LI MAY INDREW HUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FOR MY TEACHING IND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSS TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS FOR SIGMATIC FOR SIGMATIC IS A WELLNESS COMPANY THAT MAKES MUSHROOM COFFEE AND IF YOU'RE ASKING YOURSELF WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO BOOK MUSHROOMS IN COFFEE FIRST OF ALL LET ME TELL YOU THESE ARE NOT PSYCHODELIC MUSHROOMS AND KNOW THE COFFEE DOESN'T TASTE LIKE MUSHROOMS THE COFFEE IS DELICIOUS AND YOU DON'T TASTE MUSHROOMS AT ALL I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN USING FOR SIGMATIC COFFEE AND BEEN STOCKING INTO MY LABORATORY FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW LONG BEFORE I EVER HAD THE PODCAST OR FOR SIGMATIC WAS A SPONSOR THE TWO KINDS OF MUSHROOMS THAT ARE IN FOR SIGMATIC COFFEE ARE LIONS MANE AND CHOGAM MUSHROOMS BOTH OF WHICH HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE A SLIGHT ANXILIOTIC EFFECT TO REDUCE ANXIETY AND LIONS MAN HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN IN SEVERAL STUDIES TO LOWER THE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION JUST SLIGHTLY ALTHOUGH I WOULDN'T CONSIDER IT A TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION THAT'S AN ATTRACTIVE BENEFIT AS WELL AS HAVE SOME EFFECT AT OFFSET IN COGNIVE DO CLINE I'LL BE IT SLIGHTLY THE EFFECTS WERE REAL IN THE STUDIES A THAT I'VE FOUND SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY FOR SIGMATIC YOU CAN GO TO FOUR SIGMATIC DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN THAT'S F O YOU ARE S I G M A T I C DOC CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND IF YOU DO THAT YOU'LL GET FORTY PER CENT OFF YOUR ORDER PLUS FREESHIPPING ON MUSHROOM COFFEE BUNDLES THAT'S FOR SIGMATIC DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN FOR UP TO FORTY PER CENT OFF AND FREESHIPPING TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSOF BROUGHT TO US BY BLINKIST BLINKISIS ANAP THAT HAS THOUSANDS OF NONFICTION BOOKS CONDENSE DOWN TO JUST FIFTEEN MINUTES OF KEYTAKEWAYS THAT YOU CAN READ OR LISTEN TO I MAY BIG READER AND I'M A BIG CONSUMER OF NONFICTION AND MOST OF THE TIME I CONSUME BOOKS IN THEIR TRADITIONAL FORM LIKE A BOOK WHERE YOU FLIP THE PAGES AND SO FORTH I ALSO LISTEN TO FULL LENGTH AUDIO BOOKS HOWEVER OVER TIME WE KNOW THAT WE FORGET LOTS OF THINGS AND EVEN THOUGH SOMETIMES I THINK I GOT ALL THE CRITICAL INFORMATION FROM A BOOK WHEN I LIST IN TO BLINKEST AND I GET THE FIFTEEN MINUTE RUN DOWN EITHER IN AUDIO OR IN WRITTEN FORM WHAT I FIND IS THERE KEE POINTS THAT OFTENTIMES I MIST AND SO IT'S A GREAT WAY FOR ME TO BOTH JOG MY MEMORY AND TO BRING FORWARD IDEAS THAT I HADN'T CONSIDERED PREVIOUSLY THEY HAVE THOUSANDS OF NONFICTION TITLES AND SOME REALLY TERRIFIC ONES IN THE SCIENCE CATEGORY FOR EXAMPLE DAVID EGLEMEN'S BOOK LIVE WIRED WHICH CAME OUT RECENTLY AS A BOOK I READ IN FULL LENGTH FORM AND IHAVE LISTENED TO THE BLINKEST VERSION OF IT AS WELL LIVE WIRED IS A BOOK ABOUT NEURO PLASTICITY THE BRAINSABILITY TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE I GET SO MANY QUESTIONS AND REQUESTS FOR BOOKS ABOUT NERRL PLASTICITY IN MY OPINION LIVE WIRED IS THE MOST RECENT AND UP TO DAY TE AND THE BEST ONE TO DATE SO THAT'S THERE DAVIDS IN CLAYER'S BOOK LIFE SPAN DAVID AS MANY AS YOU KNOW AS MANY OF YOU KNOW IS A PROFESSOR OF GENETTICS AT HARBARD MEDICAL SCHOOL LIFESPAN IS THIS TERRIFIC BOOK ABOUT AGING AS A DISEASE AND THE FUTURE AND PRESENT OF LONGEVITY TREATMENTS VERY INTERESTING BOOK AS WELL AS MAT WALKERS BOOK WHY WE SLEEP MAT OF COURSE IS A PROFESSOR T YOU SEE BURKLY AND WHY WE SLEEP IS A TERRIFIC BOOK ABOUT WY WE SLEEP THE SCIENCE OF SLEEPING AND THINGS YOU CAN DO TO IMPROVE YOUR SLEEP ALL OF THOSE ARE ON BLINKIST BUT WITH BLINKIS YOU GET UNLIMITED ACCESS TO THEIR MASSIVE LIBRARY OF NON FICTION IF YOU LIKE TO TRY

PART OF THE DAY AND TO EAT LO CARB AND QUITO ISH THROUGHOUT THE DAY THAT'S FOR ALERTNESS AND ATTENTION SO I CAN WORK AND FOCUS AND I DON'T FEEL SLUGGISH OR BRAIN FOG AND THEN AT NIGHT AND IN THE EVENING AS WHEN I TEND TO EAT MY CARBOHYDRATES TO AID THE TRANSITION TO SLEEP THAT'S WHAT WORKS FOR ME MONK PACK BARS ARE TRIFIC SNACK WETHER NOT YOUR QUITO ALL THE TIME WHETHER NOT YOUR LO CARBOR EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS AND I DON'T SAY THAT LIGHTLY I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF BARS IN GENERAL MOST BARS TO ME TAKES LIKE A COMMINATION OF UM YOU KNOW A METAL BUMPER MIXED WITH SOME CARDBOARD AND SOME LONG TRIMMINGS AND SOME ARTIFICIAL SUGAR MON PACK BARS WHEN THEY 'RE SENTO ME ON CIGARAT I'LL TRY THEM I TRIED IT OH THIS IS A PROBLEM CAUSE I LIKE THEM VERY VERY MUCH AND AND WHEN I SAY IT'S A PROBLEM IT REALLY IS A PROM I ACTUALL KEEP THE MONK PACK BOXES IN MY BASEMENT SO THAT I DON'T TEAR THROUGH THEM ALL AT ONCE I MAY HUGE FAN OF THE CARMAIL SEASALT FLAVOR SDELICIOUS OS TALKING ABOUT IT MAKES ME HUNGRY FOR ONE BUT THEY ALSO HAVE SSALT DART CHOCOLATE PIN A BUTTER DARK CHOCOLATE THEY'RE TERRIFIC IN ADDITION OF BEING QUITO FRIENDLY THERE ALSO GLUTEN FRE PLANT BAST

COM AND ENTER THE COT HUBERMAN CH ECK OUT TO GET TWENTY PERCENT OFF YOUR PURCHASE THIS MONTH WE'VE BEEN TALKING ALL ABOUT HORMONES WHICH ARE THESE ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE CHEMICALS IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY THEY IMPACT ARE ENTIRE LIFE SPAN SO FROM THE TIME THAT WE ARE IN THE WOMB THEY ARE CONTROLLING THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR BRAIN AND OUR BODIES AFTER WE ARE BORN THEY ARE STILL CONTROLLING THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR BRAIN AND BODIES AND I DID SAY DEVELOPMENT AND THAT'S BECAUSE CONTRARY TO WHAT MOST PEOPLE THING DEVELOPMENT LAST THE ENTIRE LIFE SPAN FROM THE TIME YOU 'RE CONCEIVED UNTILL THE TIME YOU DIE YOU ARE DEVELOPING YOU ARE CHANGING AND HORMONES ARE CONSTANTLY UPDATING AND CHANGING THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS OF YOUR BODY THEY HAVE TWO MAJOR KINDS OF EFFECTS ONE ARE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY BIND TOO OR CON APARKIN PARKING SPOTS ON CELLS AND IMPACT ALL SORTS OF THINGS LIKE THE GROWTH OF CELLS ET CETERA THEY ALSO CAN CONTROL GENE EXPRESSION THIS IS THE WAY THAT HORMONS DURING PUBERTY CONTROL BODY HAIR GROWTH AND ABREAST DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH OF MUSCLES AND LIMBS AND HEIGHT AN ALL SORTS OF THINGS THEY ARE INCREDIBLE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TESTOSTERONE AND ESTROGEN WE TALKED ABOUT INSOLEN AND GLUCAGONE AND SOMEBOTHE OTHER THINGS TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT METABOLISM MAINLY GOING TO TALK ABOUT TFHIROID HORMONE AND GROWTH HORMON AND SOME OTHER RELATED PATHWAYS I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN TO YOU THE LOGIC OF HOW THIROID HORMONE AND GROWTH HORMONE WORK IT WILL BECOME OBVIOUS WHY I'VE PAIRED THIROID AND GROWTH HORMONE TOGETHER IN THE SAME EPISODE AND I WILL OF COURSE TALK ABOUT TOOLS THAT YOU CAN USE TO ELEVATE OR REDUCE THIROID HORMON THERE ARE CASES WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO REDUCE THIROID HORMN I WILL TALK ABOUT TOOLSTAT YOU CAN USE TO ELEVATE GROWTH HORMON THEIRE RARE CASES WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO REDUCE GROWTH HORMON MOST PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN INCREASING GROWTH HORMN SO TO DAY IS GOING TO BE RICH WITH INFORMATION RICH WITH ACTIONABLE TOOLS AND AS ALWAYS THE IDEA IS TO SPELL OUT AND ORGANIZATIONAL LOGICS YOU CONCOME AWAY FROM THIS EPISODE AND INFACT THE ENTIRE MONTH ON HORMONS REALLY UNDERSTANDING AT SOME LEVEL WHAT THESE THINGS WE CALL HORMONES ARE AND HOW THEY WORK AND THAT'S REALY TO ARM YOU TO ENCOUNTER INFORMATION GOING FORWARD WHETHER NOT COMES FROR ME OR FROM SOMEBODY ELSE A BOOK OR AF COURSE SOME PLACE ELSE ON LINE TO MAKE SENSE OF HOW TO WORK WITH THESE INCREDIBLE CHEMICALS WE CALL HORMONS BEFORE WE BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT THIROID AND GROWTH HORMONE AND HOW ARE METABOLISM WORKS AND HOW TO CONTROL METABOLISM I WANT TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS THAT I RECEIVED FROM YOU FROM THE AUDIENCE EVERY ONCE AND WHILE SOMEONE WILL SEND ME HEY QUITE EARNEST QUESTION ABOUT SOMETHING THEY SAW ON THE INTERNET AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE HEARD ABOUT QUITE A BIT IN THE LAST COUP OF WEEKSES WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HORMONES AND FOOD IN TAKE AND HOW THOWS INTERACT IS THIS QUESTION OF ARE CERTAIN FOODS PARTICULARLY GOOD FOR CERTAIN ORGANS OF THE BODY AND CAN THAT BE PREDICTED ON THE BASIS OF THE SHAPE OF THOSE FOODS SO FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE QUESTION AS A VALID ONE BECAUSE THE IMTHE I SEE THIS EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE OUT THERE PEOPLE WILL SAY WELL YOU KNOW WALNUTS ARE IN THE SHAPE OF THE BRAIN AND THEREFORE THEY ARE GOOD FOR YOUR BRAIN OR YOU KNOW A PARTICULAR FRUIT LIKE THE BEAT OFTEN LOOKS LIKE A HEART IN ITS GOOD FOR YOUR HEART AND I CERTAINLY INVITE QUESTIONS OF ALL KINDS PROVIDED THER SINCERE QUESTIONS HOWEVER I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY SCIENCE WHATSOEVER SUPPORTING THE IDEA THAT THE SHAPE OF A GIVEN FOOD OR OBJECT FOR THAT MATTER IS RELEVANT TO ITS FUNCTIONAL ROLE IN THE BODY IN REFERENCE TO BIOLOGY NOW BEATS CONTAIN SOMETHING THATWEREGONGTO TALK ABOUT TO DAY THAT CONTAIN A SUBSTANCE CALLED ARGENINE WHICH ACTUALLY CAN CONTROL THET DILATION OF BLOOD VESSELS AND ARTERIES SO IT HAS SOME RELATIONSHIP TO HEART AND HEART HEALTH ALNUTS CONTAIN VARIOUS FATYACIDS THAT MAY BE I WANE NOT UNDERSCORE MAYBE BENEFICIAL FOR CERTAIN ASPECTS OF BRAIN HEALTH BUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT THE SHAPE OF THE FOOD ITSELF IS RELEVANT AND YOU KNOW I THINK WHATS HAPPENED IS IS THAT A PEOPLE HAVE GONE OUT THERE AND FOUND FOODS THAT CONTAIN CERTAIN SUBSTANCES LIKE CARROTS AND VIDOMANAE OR WALNUTS AND PARTICULAR FATYACIDS OR A BEATS AND ARGENINE AND THEY'VE SELECTED THE FOODS THAT HAPPEN TO BE IN THE SHAPE OF THE THING A THE ORGAN THAT THE PARTICULAR SUBSTANCE LIKE VIDEMONAE OR FADIACIDS AND SO FORTH MIGHT BENEFIT OR SUPPORT BUT OF COURSE THEREARE MANY MANY OTHER SOURCES OF THES NEUTRIANTS THAT DON'T COME FROM WALNUTS OR FROM BEATS A OR FROM CARROTS AND SO I GUESS THE SHORT WAY TO PUT IT IS THAT THE IDEA THAT THE SHAPE OF SOME SOME FOOD OM IS IN INDICATION OF WHETHER NOT THAT FOOD WOULD BE HEALTHY FOR PARTICULAR ORGAN IN THE BODIES ABSOLUTELY UNFOUNDED I DON'T KNOW OF ANY EVIDENCE FOR IT AND I'M NOT OUT TO QUASHANYBODIES O GREAT LOVE OF THESE FOODS I ENJOY ALL THE FOODS I JUST DESCRIBED BUT THE SHAPE OF THINGS IN THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE BEARS VERY LITTLE A IF ANY ON RELEVANTS TO THE NEUTRIANCS THAT IT CAN THAT IT CONTAINS AND THEREFORE THE ORGANS THAT ITS SUPPORTS SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION BUT O IF YOU SEE THAT OUT THERE OM I WOULD A I DON'T EVEN THIK YOU NEED TO TELL THE PERSON WHOSE PUTTING THAT INFORMATION OUT TO THE WORLD I WOULD JUST YOU KNOW BACK AWAY SLOWLY ONE OTHER THING BEFORE WE MOVE INTO TO DAYS MATERIAL LAST EPISODE I TALKED ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WITH MOLSIFIRES IN HIGHLY PROCESS FOODS AND THE WAY THAT THEY CAN STRIP THE MUCOSAL LINING OF THE GUT AND THEY CAN LIMIT THE SIGNALING OF HORMONES LIKE C C K THAT CAN SIGNAL TO THE BRAI IN SATIETY THIS SIGNAL TO STOP EATING AND THEN WE GOT INTO A DISCUSSION ABOUT ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS AND I THROUGHOUT STEVIA AS AN ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER AND SEVERAL PEOPLE REACHED OUT TO CORRECT ME THAT STEVIA IS NOT AN ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER IT IS A NON COLORIC SWEETENER AND YOU ARE CORRECT I LUMPED ARTIFICIAL AND NON COLORIC SWEETENERS TOGETHER AND THANKS TO MANY OF YOU THAT ALSO SEND ME SOME REFERENCES IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT STEVIA CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE GUT MOCROBYUM IT DOES SEEM UNIQUE AMONG NON COLORIC SWEETENERS THEY'RE PROBABLY OTHERS OUT THERE THE OTHER THING THAT WE DISCUSS IS HOW STEVIA CAN LEAD TO SLIGHT INCREASES IN BLOOD GLUCOS BUT CAN ALSO IMPROVE INSOLEN MANAGEMENT JUST SLIGHTLY PROBABLY CANCELS TO ZERO AN TERMS OF ITS IMPACT ON BLOOD GLUCOS PROVITED ITSNOTIC CONCENTRATIONS THAT ARE SUPERSUPERSWEET INGESTION OF ANYTHING THAT'S VERY SWEET WHETHER NOT CONTAINS CALERIES OR NOT ARTIFICIAL OR NOT WI'LL CREATE AN INSOLENT RESPONSE IN FACT JUST WALKING PAST A BAKERY AND SMELLING DELICIOUS BAK BAKED GOODS CAN INCREASE YOUR INSOLENT SECRESION AND SO JUST WANTED POINT THAT OUT THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION AND THE REFERENCES THAT YOU FOUND PLY SEND ADDITIONAL ONES IF YOU DO FIND THEM AND I APRECIATE THAT YOU ALLOW ME TO MAKE CORRECTIONS EVERYONE SOIMIS BE HERE AND THE OPPORTUNIMATE CORRECTIONS KEEPS US ALL ON THE SAME PAGE AND PLEASE DO KEEP ANY FEET BACK THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT PARTICULAR THINGS I COVER HERE COMING MY WAY THERE IS SO MUCH INTEREST IN METABOLISM WE HEREABOUT HAVING A HIGH OR A LOW METABOLISM THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WOULD LIKE TO REDUCE THEIR METABOLISM THEY SIMPLY CAN'T EAT ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN THEIR WAIGHT MOST PEOPLE HOWEVER STRUGGLE WITH THE OPPOSITE ISSUE THEY STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY WEIGHT AND OR THEIR METABOLISM IS TOO LOW NOW THEIR A VARIETY OF REASONS WHY METABOLISM CAN BELOW TODAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TWO HORMONES THIROID HORMONE AND ITS RELATED PATHWAYS AND GROWTH HORMONE AND ITS RELATED PATHWAYS WHICH ARGUABLY ARE THE TWO HORMONES AND TO SYSTEMS IN THE BODY THAT ARE MOST SIGNIFICANT FOR SETTING YOUR OVERALL LEVEL OF METABLISM BEFORE WE DIVE INTO THOSE I JUST ONE TO COVER A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT METABOLISM IS AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHICH ORGANS IN YOUR BODY USE THE MOST ENERGY SO METABOLISM IS THE CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY NOT NESERELY EATING BUT IT'S THE USE OF ENERGY IN THE CELLS OF THE BODY FOR GROWTH OF TISSUES FOR REPAIR OF TISSUES AND ALSO JUST FOR DATEDAY MAINTENANCE OF FUNCTION A GOOD EXAMPLE OF MAINTENANCE OF FUNCTION WOULD BE YOUR BRAIN MOST OF YOUR METABOLIC NEEDS YOURE SO SO CALLED BAZAL OR RESTING METABOLIC NEEDS ARE FOR YOUR BRAIN FOR THINKING IF YOU ARE TO JUST SIT IN A BED ALL DAY AND DO NOTHING BUT THINK THAT CONSUMES ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF YOUR M TABOLIC NEEDS NOW THERE'S ALSO MOVING AROUND IF YOU HAVE A JOB THAT REQUIRES THE LOT OF HAVE YOU LABOR OR LIFTING THINGS OR YOUR NEW PARENT IN YOUR CARRING KIDS AROUND YOU'RE GOING UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS OR BACK AND FORT THROUGH TO THE REFRIGERATOR FOR FORMULA ET CETERA WELL THEN YOUR BURNING MORE ENERGY BURNING MORE CALORIES BUT EVEN IF YOU ARE VERY PHYSICALLY ACTIVE UNLESS YOU'RE AND ULTRAMARITHONER OR A MARITHONOR CHANCES ARE THAT SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF YOUR METABOLIC NEEDS ARE COMING JUST FROM YOUR BRAIN AND THAT'S BECAUSE NURONS CONSUME A LOT OF ENERGY R ONS OF COURSE ERE JUST THE NERVE CELLS OF YOUR BRAIN SO THESE TWO HORMONES THIROID HORMONE AND GROWTH HORMONE WE THINK OF AS RELATED TO METABOLISM OF THINGS IN THE BODY KEEPING BODY FAT LOW AND KEEPING MUSCLES STRONG AND TENDON STRONG AND REPAIRING THEMSELVES ET CETERA BUT THEY ARE ALSO KEY FOR BRAIN FUNCTION FOR THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN COGNIVE FUNCTION THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPIN SO THE BIG THEME I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE IS THAT METABOLISM ISN'T JUST ABOUT LOSING WEIGHT BUT HAVING A HIGH METABOLISM PROVIDED S NOT TOO HIGH IS GREAT IT MEANS THAT YOU WILL HAVE MORE LEAN TISSUE MORE BONE AND MUSCLE AND LESS ADAPOST TISSUE FAT AND WE KNOW THAT THAT'S HEALTHY HOW MUCH FAT AND HOW MUCH MUSCLE WELL THAT VARIES IN THE NUMBERS ON THIS ARE ALWAYS SHIFTING BUT IN GENERAL MUSCLE AND IT'S RELATED TISSUES BURNS MORE ENERGY THAN DOES ADIPOST TISSUE OR FAT AND THE WATER IN YOUR BODY DOESN'T CONSUME ANY ENERGY SO METABOLISM CAN BE INCREASED SIMPLY BY ADDING MUSCLE TO YOUR BODY AND REDUCING FAT OR ADJUSTING THE RATIO OF THE TWO BUT REGARDLESS EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED IN CHANGING BODY COMPOSISION THESE TWO HORMONES THIROID HORMONE AD GROWTH HORMONE ARE SUPER IMPORTANT FROM METABOLISM OF ALL KINDS INCLUDING TISSUE REPAIR AFTER INJURY INCLUDING MAINTAINING COGNIVE FUNCTION AND WELL BEING AND THE ABILITY TO THINGK CLEARLY AS YOU AGE OFFSETTING TIMENSIA AND SO FORTH SO THE BIG THEME HERE REALLY INCLUDES THE PREVIOUS EPISODES YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE SEEN THOSE EPISODES BUT FOR THE LAST THREE EPISODES AND TO DAY AS WELL WEE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HORMONS THESE SUBSTANCES THAT ARE RELEASE FROM ONE LOCATION THE BODY THAT GO AND ACT AT OTHER LOCATIONS IN THE BODY I MAN TELL YOU HOW THAT WORKS FOR THIROID AND GROWTH HORMONE BUT NOW THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT TESTASTRONE AND ESTROGEN AND AND YOUARE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT THIEROID IN GROWTH HORMONE I WANT YOU TO REALIZE THAT THERE'S A REPEATING LOGIC FIRST OF ALL THEIR NURONS IN YOUR BRAIN IND AN AREACALL THE HYPOTHALEMUS WHICH IS JUST MEANS ITS BELOW THE THALEMUS HYPO IT SITS AT THE BASE YOUR BRAIN IN THE FRONT SBARE THE FORBRAN SO ITMORE OR LESS ABOVE THE ROOF YOUR MOUTH MAY BE ABOUT A CENTIMETER OR SO AND THEN ABOUT A CENTMETER FORWARD IN MOST PEOPLE AND NURONS IN THE HYPOTHALEMUS RELEASE HORMONES THAT ARE CALLED RELEASING HORMONES SO WE'VE TALKED IN PREVIOUS EPISODES ABOUT FOR INSTANCE GANADA TROPIN RELEASING HORMO N SO THOSE ARE LITTLE NURONS THAT THEN SIGNAL ANOTHER BRAIN AREA CALL THE PETUITARY TO RELEASE OTHER HORMONES TODAY ORGAN TO SEE THIS AGAIN IN THE BRAIN YOU HAVE NURONS THAT RELEASE THIRO TROPIN OR THIROID RELEASING HORMONE YOU ALSO HAVE GROWTH HORMONE RELEASING HORMONS ANY TIME YOU HEAR RELEASING CHANCES ARE THOSE ARE NURONS THAT ARE IN YOUR BRAIN AND THE EXTEND LITTLE WIRES WE CALL AXONS INTO YOUR PETUITARY AND THE PETUITARY RELEASES A BUNCH O HORMONES INTO THE BLOOD STREAM AND THE PETUITARY RELEASES THINGS THAT MOST OFTEN HAVE THE NAME OF STIMULATING HORMONE BECAUSE THEY STIMULATE OR ORGANS SO IN KEEPING WITH THE THEME OF THIROID HORMONE YOU HAVE THIROID RELEASING HORMONE IN THE BRAIN TELLS THE PETUTARY TO RELEASE THIROID STIMULATING HORMONE AND THEN THE THIROID WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT INA MOMENT RELEASES THIROID HORMONES IN THE TESTASTERONE AND ESTROGEN EPISODE WE TALKED ABOTH YO HAVE GANATATROP IN RELEASING HORMONE THERE'S THE RELEASING AGAIN UP IN THE BRAIN REMEMBER RELEASING HORNMONE COMES FROM THE BRAIN THEN YOU HAD THINGS LIKE LUTINIZING HORMONE AND PHOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE WHICH WEREIN THE PETUITARY AND THOSE TRAVEL TO THE OVERIES ORE THE TESTIES AND ACTED ON THOSE TISSUES OKE SO PLEASE TRY AND INBED THIS LOGIC IF YOU HEAR THE WORD RELEASING HORMONE IT'S COMING FROM THE BRAIN AND THAT MAKES IT ACTIONABLE IN CERTAIN WAYS THAT WILL RETURN TOO LATER IN ADDITION THE PETUITARYES IS LETTING GO OF ALL THESE HORMONES INTO THE BLOODSTREAM THAT ARE STIMULATING DIFFERENT TISSUES SO FOR THIROID ITS THIROID STIMULATING HORMONE AND THEN IT GOES TO THE THIROID AND THE THIROID IS A LITTLE BUTTERFLY SHAPED GLAND THAT'S RIGHT AROUND THE ATAM'S APPLE IF YOU WANT TO SEA ORS NOT DIRECTLY CAUSE IT'S GOT SKIN OVER IT WHAT YOU WOULD DO AS YOU'D TAKE A SIPO WATER YOUD LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND YOU'D SWALLOW AND THE THING THAT MOVES UP AND DOWN THAT IS YOUR THIROID NOW SOME PEOPLE CALL T YOUR ATAM'S APPLE BECAUSE IT SITS RIGHT NEAR THIS PRETUSION IN THE TRAKIA WHICH IS THE ATAM'S APPLE NO MATTER WHETHER NOT YOUR MALE FEMALE OR REGARDLES SO WHT YOUR CHORMOZOMO BACKGROUND IS EVERYONE HAS IN ATAM'S APPLE IT TENDS TO BE MORE PRONOUNCED IN PEOPLE THEY GOT A SURGE OF TESTASTRONE EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE IT HAS A TESTOSTERONE SENSITIVITY TO IT AND THAT ACTUALLY CONTROLS THE TAMBER THE SO CALLED DEEPNESS OF THE VOICE SO THE THIROID GLAND SITS RIGHT THERE AND IT'S GOT FOUR LITTLE BUMPS BEHIND IT CALLE THE PERATHIROID GLAND AND IT RELEASES TWO HORMONES INTO THE BLOOD TO STIMULATE DIFFERENT TISSUES AND THEIR METABOLISM WHN THOSE HORMONES ARE CALLED TE FOR AND TE THREE SO THIS IS ALREADY SOUNDING LIKE A LOT OF INFORMATIONS REALLY EASY I PROMISE RELEASING HORMON COMES FROM THE BRAIN STIMULATING HORMONE COMES FROM THE PETUITARY AND IN THIS CASE WHERE TALKING ABOUT THE THIROID BINDING UP THAT STIMULATING HORMONE AND SAYING O I NEED A RELESE SOMETHING THAT RELEASES TE FOR IN TEE THREE AD GUESS WHAT YOU CAN BASELY FORGET ABOUT TEE FOR TFOR IT'S NOT COMPLETELY INACTIVE IT HAS SOME ROLLS BUT TE THREE IS THE ONE THAT'S MORE LESS ACTIVE NOW WHAT DOES THIEROID HORMON DO NOT OF  PEOPLE THINK O THIEROID ITS IKEMETABOLISM AND PEOPLE WERE HYPOTHIEROID ILL HAVE BULGING EYES IND A REAL THIN AND PEOPLE HAVE HYPOTHIEROID ARE OVERWEIGHT AND THEY HAVE LIKE THEIR EYES ARE LIKE ARE OU NOW HALF CLOTHES OR SOMETHING AND INDEED PHIEROID HORMON CONTROLS A LOT OF THE FEATURES OF THE FACE AND THE EYES AND ON AND IT CON CONTROL AMOUNTS OF ADIPOST TISSUE AND SO FORTH BUT THE MAIN ROLL OF THIEROID HORMON OF T THREE IS TO PROMOTE MATABOLISM AND THAT DOESN'T JUST MEAN THE CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY IT MEANS THE UTILIZATION OF ENERGY INCLUDING THE BUILD UP OF TISSUES SO IT ACTS ON ALL SORTS OF TARGET TISSUES IN THE BODY IT ACTS ON MUSCELE IT ACTS ON THE LIVER IT ACTS ON THE CARDILAGE IT ACTS ON THE BONE AND IT'S NOT JUST INVOLVED IN USING ENERGY ITS ALSO CONVERTING ENERGY I DO REALIZE I SAID THAT TWICE IT'S INVOLVED IN TAKING FATS AND BREAKING THEM DOWN INTO FATIACIDS AND CONVERTING THOSE INTO EIGHT P WHICH IS IN IMPORTANT THING FOR CELLS TO USE ENERGY IT'S ALSO INVOLVED IN TAKING SUGARS AND TURNING THOSE INTO ENERGY AND YES IT GOES TO ADAPOST TISSUE TO FAT WE HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF FACT THAT BLL TALK ABOUT TODAY BUT IT GOES TO WHITE FAT AND IT LIBERATES OR HELPS LIBERATE SOME OF THE FATS FROM THOSE FAT CELLS AND USE THEM FOR ENERGY AND THIS IS WHY HIER THIEROID IS ASSOCIATED WITH LEANER BODIES LOWER THIEROID IS ASSOCIATED WITH LESLANE BODIES SO ONE THING THAT'S ABSOLUTE KEE AND IS ACTIONABLE WERE RIGHT THERE ALREADY IN DISCUSSING TOOLS IS IODINE IODINE COMES FROM THINGS IN THE OCEAN RIGHT AND HERE COUPLE INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT IODINE AND THN WE'LL TALK ABOUT WEATHER  NOT YOU SHOULD BE SUPPLEMENTING IODINE OR NOT FIRST OF ALL IODINE IS MOST COMMON IN SESALT IN CELP AND IN S WEED AND MOST PEOPLE CAN GET ENOUGH IODINE FROM THE FOOD THEY EAT END OR THE TABLE SALT THEY CONSUME ALMOST ALL TABLE SALT FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU ARE CONTAINS IODINE THE PHIEROID NEEDS IODINE IN ORDER TO PRODUCE THIEROID HORMON AND YOU NEED SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF THIEROID HORMON NOT TOO MUCH BUT YOU NEED IT SO CHANCES ARE YOU ARE GETTING ENOUGH IODNE ALTHOUGH YOU MIGHT NOT ESPECIALLY THOSE OF YOU FALLING A PARTICULARLY QUOTIN QUO CLEAN DIET MIGHT NOT BE GETTING ENOUGH IODINE HERE'S THE DEAL WITH IODINE IODINE COMBINES WITHIN A MENOACID THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE CALLED ELL TYROCINE ELL THYROCINE COMES FROM MEAT FROM NUTS THERE ARE SOME PLANTBA SOURCES AS WELL IT IS THE PRECURSER TO DOPAMI BUT IN THE THIEROID IODINE COMBINES OR WORKS WITH ELL TYROSINE TO PRODUCE T THREE AN T FOR AR THE THIROID HORMONES SO YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED SUFFICIENT IODINE YOU NEED SUFFICIENT AL THIROCINE AND THEN YOU ALSO NEED SOMETHING ELSE WHICH IS CALLED SYLENIUM AND WILL TALK ABOUT SYLENIUM IN A MOMENT SO THERE'S A CONDITION THAT SHOWS UP IN LITTLE POCKETS IN THE WORLD IT'S NOT SUPERCOMMON BUT WHERE ITIT MEANING IT'S NOT VERY WIDE SPREAD BUT IN CERTAIN AREAS THAT ARE PHIRWAY FROM THE OCEAN AT ONE POINT THIS WAS HISTORICALLY IN THE MIDWESTERN STAYE TO THE UNITED STATES IN SOME MOUNTAIN REGIONS OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN SOME ERE IS OF A AFRICA THERE WERE FAR FROM FROM THE OCEAN PEOPLE WOULD GET EXTREMELY SWOLLEN BULGES IN THEIR NECKS AND THIS WAS CALLED GUITER AND THE REASON THEY WERE GETTING THOSE SWOLLEN BULGES IS BECAUSE THE THIEROD ITSELF WAS HYPERTIPHINE IT WAS GROWING IN AN ATTEMPT TO TURN OUT MORE PTHIEROID AND BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING A LOT OF STIMULATING HORMONE FROM THE PETUITARY BUT AND I DO'T WANT TO GO TOO FAR OFF TRACK HERE BUT AS YOU RECALL THE BRAIN AND HE PETUITARY ARE PAYING ATTENTION IN A CELLER SENSE TO THE LEVELS OF HORMONES IN THE BLOOD AND WHEN THOSE HORMONES GET TOO HIGH THEY SHUT OFF THE STIMULATING HORMWHEN THEY SHUT DOWN THE SIGNAL TO MAKE MORE CONOLIKE A THERMISTAT WHEN THE LEVELS ARE TOO LOW LIKE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TO STOPSTRONE IN THE BLOOD STREAM WHERE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ESTRGIN THE BRAIN WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH OUT THE SIGNAL TO MAKE MORE SIMILARLY IF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH THIEROID CIRCULATING OR THERE'S NOT ENOUGH IODINE TO MAKE THIEROID THEREFORE NOT ENOUGH THIEROID HORMONE CIRCULATING THE THIROID GLAND ITSELF IS NOT GETTING SHUT DOWN THERE'S TONS OF STIMULATNG HORMONE AND RELEASING HORMONE COMING FROM THE BRAIN LIKE RELEASE RELEASE RELEASE IN THERE'S NO WAY THEY CAN MAKE THIROID HOARMONIS TO THE GLANGERS GETS BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER ANC OF PEOPLE GET GUAITER THIS IS ONE OTHER REASONS WI TABLE SALT HAS IODINE IN IT ALTHOUGH THERE ARE OTHER FOODS TO HAVE IODINE IN IT AS WELL SO HOW MUCH IODNED YOU NEED WELL YOU DON'T NEED A WHOLE LOT SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE HYPOTHIROIDAL MIGT AND I WANT EMPHASIZED MIGHT YOU ABSOLUCE YOU TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR THIS IS A SERIOUS MATTER ANY TIME YOUR TALKING ABOUT A HORMONES ORE MANIPULATING LEVELS OF THIEROD YOU ABSOLUTE ONE TALT YOUR DOCTOR SOME PEOPLE BENEFIT FROM SUPPLEMENTING IODINE IT IS CONTAINED IN MOST SALTS IT'S IN HEMALAEAN SALT NOT ALWAYS BUT OFTEN I KNOW THESE DASTHEREIS A LOT OF A EXCITEMENT ABOUT PINK SALTS AND SEASALTS AND LOT YOU KNOW THER KIND OF ARTISAN SALT THING HAS KIND OF TAKEN OFF A IN THE FOOTY LAND WHICH IS GREAT SOME OF THEM AR ARE ACTALLY QUITE TASTE YOU CAN JUST TAKE ITS DIRECTLY IF YOU LIKE THE TASTE OF SALT A BUT IODINE CAN BE SUPPLEMENTED THROUGH THINGS LIKE KELP AND SEAWEED AND KELP TABLETS NOW IF YOU ARE HYP EARTHIROIDLE YOU MAKE TOO MUCH THIROYD THAT ACTION CAN BE A PROBLEM SO REALLY THE BEST WAY TO FIGURE THISOUT IS TO GET YOUR BLOOD LEVELS TESTED OF THIEROID HORMONE BUT THERE'S SO MUCH IODINE IN THE OCEAN THAT BELIEVE IT OR NOT P EOPLE THAT LIVE NEAR THE COAST CAN ACTUALLY JUST ABSORB IT THROUGH THE AIR JUST BY BREATHING OCEAN AIR SO THAT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF JUST HOW LITTLE IADINE YOU ACTING YOU TO CONSUME IN FOOD OR IN SALT SO IF YOU ARE WITHIN A FEW MILES OF THE OCEAN OR YOU VISIT THE OCEAN FROM TIME TO TIME YOUR PROBABLY GETTING PLENTY IT DOES HAVE TO COME TOGETHER AS I MENTION WITH ALTYRISINE AND THIS IS WHY FOODS THAT CONTAIN AL TYRISINE AND PROVIDED THAT YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT IODINE IN YOUR DIET AND IF YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT SELENIUM IN YOUR DIET DOES SERVE TO INCREASE YOUR METABOLISM AND THAT IS AGAIN IS FOR THE GROWTH AND REPAIR OF TISSUES AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT KEEPING YOUR METABOLISM HIGH SO THAT YOU CAN BE ON THE LEANER SIDE OF THINGS OR JUST YOUR BODY WEIG AS CUS ME YOUR A BODY COMPOSITION RATIOES THE WAY YOU LIKE REPAIR OF INJURIES REPAIR OF BRAIN TISSUE CLEARANCE OF ANY DAMAGE FROM NURONS CLEARANCE OF ANY DAMAGE IT THAT TO THE BODY IS ALSO GOING TO DEPEND ON THIEROID AGAIN METABOLISM BEING THIS KIND OF RATE OF FUEL CONSUMPTION AND USE IN THE BODY GENERALLY NOT JUST ABOUT BODY MASSINDEXES AND THINGS THAT SORT SO LET'S TALK ABOUT SELENIUM BECAUSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND EVEN THOUGH MOST FEOPLE ARE GETTING A LOT OF A SUFFICIENT IODINE AND MOST PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY GETTING ENOUGH ALTRISINE I'M GUESSING MOST PEOPLE MAY NOT BE GETTING ENOUGH SELENIUM IF THEIR GOAL IS TO INCREASE FHIEROID HOME ON AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT THE THE LITERATURE SAYS WITHOUT GOING IN TO THE BIL CHEMISTRY SELINIUM IS IMPORTANT IN ORDER FOR FIROID HORMONE TO BE MADE BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT IT ALLOWS EL TYRIINE AND IODINE TO INTERACT AND THE THING IS MOST PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING ENOUGH SELLENIUM BECAUSE THEY DON'T EAT FOODS THAT ARE HIGH IN SLENIUM NOW TH HOW MUCH CELENIUM YOU NEED WILL DEPEND ON WHERE YOU LIVE AT ACTUALLY VARIES COUNTRY BY COUNTRY SOME COUNTRIES I FOUND A SAY THAT YOU SHOULD GET A HUNDRED MICROGRAM SOME SAY TWO HUNDRED SOMES AY A HUNDRED AN FIFTY FIVE THE AVERAGE WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED N FIFTY FIVE MICROGRAMS THE COUNTRIES I LOOKED AT PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO INCREASE THIROYD LEVELS MIGHT WANT T A CONSUME MORE SELENIUM AND IF YOU CONSUME A VIDEM IN OF COURSE YOU WANT A MAKE SURE A IF IT HAS SELENIUM THAT YOU'RE NOT OVERDOING IT BY CONSUMING A LOT OF SELENIUM RICH FOODS EITHER BUT NONE THE LESS I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT MOS PEOPLE PROBABLY COULD DO WELL BY INGESTING SLIGHTLY MORE SLLENIUM THAN THEY CURRENTLY ARE ALTHOUGH OF COURSE ALWAYS TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR BRAZIL NUTS ARE THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF FOODS TO GET SELINIUM FROM IT HAS VERY HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF SELENIUM IN JUST SIX OR EIGHT SA BRAZIL NUTS CONTAIN SOMETHING LIKE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MICROGRAMS OF SELENIUM IT'S ALSO PRESENT IN FISH SO CERTAIN FISH LIKE YELLOWFIN TUNA AM ALTHOUGH NOWDAYS WHENEVER I MENTION TUNA OR SHELLFISH WHICH IS THE OTHER A RICH SOURCE OF SELINIUM PEOPLE AM WILL TELL ME IMMEDIATELY THER THETE ALL SORTS OF ISSUES AROUND FARM NOT FARM MERCURY AT CETERA SO A I'VE NEVER PARTICULARLY LIKE EATING FI SH CAUSE THE WAY IT TASTE AM SO THAT'S WHY I AVOID IT BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU TH A LIKE IT UM SURE YOUR MUCH MORE SKILLED IN I'M KNOWING WHICH FISH STOBUYN WHICH FISH NOT TO BUY HAM OF ALL THINGS A CONTAINS A LOT OF SELINIUM A FOR WHATEVEREASON PORT DOES I'M NOT A BE CONSUME REPORT O BEEF HAS SOME SELNIUM BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING IF YOU LOOK AT THE SOURCES YOU KNOW PORK BEEF TURKEY CHICKEN POTTAGE SHES EGGS BROWN RICE THE WHAT YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT BRAZIL NUTS SIXTAPE BRAZIL NUTS HAS FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MICROGRAMS OF SELINIUM AND ALL THE OTHER FOODS I MENTION AT MUCH GREATER PORTION SIZE THAN EQUIVALENT TO SIXT OR EIGHT O BRAZIL NUTS EITHER BY VOLUME OR BY A CALORIES THEY THEY HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY TO FIFTY MICROGRAMS OF SELINIUM SO IF YOU'RE NOT EATING BRAZIL NUTS O'M GESSING MOST PEOPLE AREN'T THEN AND YOU'RE NOT EATING A LOT OF A ANIMAL BASED FOODS WHICH I KNOW MANY OF YOU AREN'T THEN YOURE PROBABLY NOT GETTING ENOUGH SELINIUM AND AGAIN YOU CAN HAVE THESE O LEVELS MEASURED OR YU CAN JUST CHECK WHAT YOU'RE CONSUMING  AND FIGURE OUT WHITHER OT YOUR EMEETING THE RATION THAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO GET HEALTHY LEVELS OF THIROID IT IS PRESENT IN THINGS LIKE MUSHROOMS BUT AGAIN IN AT BOWL OF MUSHROOMS YOU KNOW THA WHAT IS THE EQUIVALENTO A A BOWL OF MUSHROOMS TWELVE MICROGRAMS OF SELINIUM AND IF THE DAILY RATION IS SOMETHING IN THE HUNDREDS TO TWO HUNDRED RANGE AGAIN LOOK IT UP FOR THE AIR YOU ARE YOU CAN SEE REALLY QUICKLY WHY THING EVEN THOUGH THINGS LIKE MUSHROOMS AND SPINICH AND MILK AND OGER IN LENTALS AND CASHUS ANOUR INTO THE VEGETARIUNM A SEGMEN IN THE LIST THAT I CONSTRUCTED YOU PROBABLY NOT GETTING ENOUGH SLINIUM SO KIVE AN INTERESTING THING IF YOUARE AN EXPERIMENTER YOU AND YOU GET THE CLEARANCE FROM YOUR DOCTOR YOU COULD TRY INCREASING YOUR SCELINIUM LEVELS AND SEE HOW THAT IMPACTS YOUR METABOLISM AGAIN BRAZIL NUTS ARE PROBABLY CAN TO BE THE MOST DIRECT A WAY TO GET SUFFICIENT SELINIUM LEVELS BUT BECAUSE LEVELS ARE SO HIGH IN BRAZIL NUTS IT ALSO MEANS THAT YOU COULD OVERDO IT AS WELL I'M NOT REALLY AWARE OF WHAT THE A CONSEQUENCES ARE OF A GETTING TOO MUCH SELINIUMA THOUGH YOU CAN GET TOO MUCH OF ANYTHING AND I'M GUESSING THOSE A CONSEQUENCES AREN'T GOOD I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT FOR CHILDREN THEIR DAILY REQUIREMENTS OF SELINIUM ARE MUCH LOWER AS LOW AS YOU KNOW THIRTY OR FORTY MICROGRAMS FOR KIDS OF FOURTEEN YEARS OR YOUNGER AN IN SOME AREAS I REALLY ONE UNDERSCORE THIS THE AMOUNT OF CELINIUM THAT'S RECOMMENDED DAILY IS AS LOW AS FIFTY FIVE MICROGRAMS SO IT'S NOT THAT YOU SHOULD BE SHOOTING FOR THOUSANDS OR EVEN HUNDRED YOU NOW HIGH LEVELS OF HUNDREDS OF OF MICROGRAMS OF SELINIUM AND AGAIN THAT MICROGRAMS NOT MILOGRAMS SO AGAIN LOOK INTO WHAT YOU NEED BUT IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO'SE INTERESTED IN KEEPING THIROID FUNCTION HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE THEN YOU CERTINLY WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE GETTIG ENOUGH IGH ADON YOU'RE GETTING ENOUGH SELINIUM ANDYOU'RE GETTING ENOUGH AL TIROSENE AND IT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT THE VARIOUS FOODS ESPECIALLY HIGHLY PROCESS FOODS THEN YOU START TO REALIZE THAT PERHAPS MANY PEOPLE MAY YOU ARE NOT NOT INCIDENTALLY ELENIUM HAS SOME OTHER EFFECTS ON HEALTH THAT CAN BE QUITE POSITIVE AND EVEN THOUGH THESE DON'T RELATE TO THIROI TO GROWTH HARMON FUNCTION SPECIFICALLY THINK YOU MIGHT A WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM GIVEN THAT WERE ON THE TOPIC OF SELENIUM THE FIRST IS THAT THEIRE THRE STUDIES ALL OF WHICH SHOWED VERY HIGH EFFICACY FOR REDUCING THE RISK OF SOMETHING CALLED PRE ECLAMPSI PREEXCUSE ME PRE ECLAMPSIA A PRECLAMPSIA IS SEIZURES THAT ARE RELATED TO BLOOD PRESSURE ISSUES JURING OR OR AROUND THE DELIVERY OF A NEW BABY AND ASHY IT'S A RARE ISH CONDITION BUT ON IDACTION CAN BE QUITE DEADLY O AND SO THE FACT THAT SELENIUM IS IMPORTANT FOR OFFSETTING PRE CLAMPSIA RISK IS INTERESTING I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT MECHANISM AND I'M GUESSING THERE ONLY A FEW OF YOU OUT THERE THAT ARE EITHER PREGNANT OR THINKING OF OF CONCEIVING SOON BUT ON THAT'S WORTH NOTING OBVIOUSLY ANYTHING RELATE TO PREGNENTCY OR LACTATION ESPECIALLY TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR O I'M GUESSING THAT SELENIUM IS PROBABLY IN A LOT OF PRENATAL FORMULAS BUT O THAT'S ONE CLEAR BENEFIT OF HAVING SUFFICIENT ELENIUM THE OTHER IS A REDUCED PROSTATE CANCER RISK ANOTHERS A STUDY SHOWING THAT HAVING SUFFICIENT SELENIUM CAN REDUCE A PROSTATE CANCE RISK AND THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT IF YOU CONSUME FOODS FROM AREAS WITH SOIL THAT'S LOW AND CELENIUM THAT CAN BE A PROBLEM AND LAST EPISOE WE TALKED ABOUT ALL THESE ISSUES RELATED TO A SOIL QUALITY A THINGS THAT ARE MAKING THEIR WAY INTO FOOD THEIR DISTRUPTING AN A HORMONES AND SO FORTH ON BUT HAVING SUFFICIENT SELENIUM FROM FOOD COULD OFFSET THE LOW CONTENT IN ANY SOIL AND SO THAT APPARENTLY CAN REDUCE PROSTATE CANCER RISK IT'S A MINOR EFFECT BUT IT'S EA STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ONE AND THE OTHER ONE IS A REDUCTION IN ACNY WHICH IS INTERESTING IT ON GUESSING THAT THAT PROBLY HAS TO DO WITH THE THROID HARMONE PATHWAY BECAUSE OF THE WAY FHIROID HARMONE CAN IMPACT TA LIVER AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THE LIVER AND VARIOUS A BIL CHEMICAL REACTIONS IN THE LIVER CAN IMPACT ACNE AND THAT'S POLIAN EPISODE ALL INTO ITSELF BUT THOSE ARE JUST SOME ADDITIONAL A BENEFITS OF GETTING SUFFICIENT SELENIUM OCASO WE'RE ALREADY DEEPINE TO TOOLS RELATED TO MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT SELENIUM IODINE AND EL TIRACENE IN ORDER TO MAKE ENOUGH FIROID HARMONES THAT CAN SUPPORT YOUR METABOLIC PROCESSES IN YOUR LIVER YOUR MUSCLES YOUR TENDANS FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE KEEPING YOUR METABOLISM HIGH O FOR BODY COMPOSITION REASONS OR FOR HEALING O FOR KEEPING YOUR BRAIN WORKING WELL EARLIER I MENTIOND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE FOLLOWING VERY CLEAN DIETS SO THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT CONSUME NO PROCESS FOODS YOU KNOW ANY STARCH THEY MIGHT EAT IS GOING TO BE IT MAY BE A RICE OR A GRAIN OR O AN ANY PROTINE THEY MIGHT CONSUME IS GOING TO BE EITHER FROM LET'S HOPE FROM A HUMANELY RAISE A ANIMAL SOURCES OR MAYBE THEIR PURE PLANT BASED BELIEVEIT OR NOT THOSE FOLKS ARE ACTUALLY VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO LO IODINE BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT DIETS THAT ARE VERY MEAT RICH AND DON'T HAVE MANY VEGETABLES AS WELL AS DIETS THAT ARE VERY VEGETABLE RICH BUT DON'T HAVE MANY MEATS OR SALTS ARE AT RISK OF LOWERING THIROID HORMON BY WAY OF THE IODINE PATHWAY AND OTHER PATHWAYS AND CELEME TRINE SIMPLIFY THIS FOR YOU CHANCES ARE IF PEOPLE ARE DOING THE ALL MEAT DIET THEY'RE NOT SPRINKLING THEY'RE NOT WRAPPING THOSE STAKES IN SEAWEED AM AND THEY MAY OR MAY NOT BE SUPPLEMENTING WITH IODINE A CHANCES ARE THEYRE PROBABLY CONSUMING IODINE SALT BUT THEYRE THEYRE REQUIREMENTS GO UP IF THEY'RE NT CONSUMING VEGETABLES PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSUMING VEGETABLES HAVE INTERESTING WE ALWAYS HERE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE OUR CRUCIFEROUS VEGETABLES AND THOSE ARE SO IMPORTANT BUT THERE ACTUALLY SUBSTANCES A COMPOUNDS WITHIN HIGH QUALITY CRUCIFEROUS VEGETABLES THAT CAN INTERFERE WITH THIROID HARMON FUNCTION SO IF YOU'RE EATING A LOT OF THAT STUFF A LOT OF CABBAGES AND YOU'LL JUST LOOK UP YOUR OTHER I THINK BROCLY AS A CRUCIFEROUSIVEGETABLE AND I WON'T READ OFF THE WHOLE LISS YOU COULD JUST A PUT INTO THE INNER NET BUT IF YOU'RE YOU KNW WE ARE ALWAYS TOLD TO EAT A LOT OF THE DARK LEAFY GREEN STUFF WELL UNLESS THAT DARK LEAFY GREEN STUFF IS KELP AUM OR SEAWEED CHANCES ARE THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH IODINE UNLESS WE'RE ADDING SALT TO OUR FOOD AND CHANCES ARE THAT WE MAY BE LOWERING THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THIROID THAT WE'RE MAKING AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT IN PLANT RICH DIETS IT'S HARD TO GET ENOUGH EL TIRASENE AND I DON'T WANT THAT YOU NOW E NOT HERE TO INFLAME ANY OF THE A THE VIGANS OR THE CARNIVOR FOLKS I DON'T TAKE A STANCE EITHER WAY ON ANY OF THAT  JUST LEARNING TRUN REPORT THE SCIENCE THE POINT I WANT A MAKE IS YOURE HEALTH IS IMPORTANT SO IF YOU ARE PURELY PLANT BASE AND YOU'RE EATING A LOT OF CRUCIFEROUS VEGETABLES MAKE SURE YOU'REGETTING ENOUGH IODINE IT DOES SEEM LIKE THE CRUCIFEROUSIVEGETABLES CAN INCREASE THE NEAD FOR FURTHER IODINE AND SAMETHING IF YOU'RE PURELY AYOU'RE ON THIS ALL MEAT DIETER YOU'RE QUITO AND YOU'RE NOT A INJESTING MANY VEGETABLES SO I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THE CLEANER THE DIET THE BETTER BUT IT TURNS AND PROBABLY THAT'S TRUE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF OF A YOU KNOW HORMON REGULATION YOU KNOW A ESTROGEN AND TESTASTR ON ANOTHER AND OTHER HORMONES THE HIGHLY PROCESS FOODS REALLY ARE TERRIBLE AM THEYRE SO MUCH EVIDENCE FOR THAT THE SALLITS IN PLASTICS AND THE PROCESS FOODS AND THE MULSIFIRES ALL THE STUFF WE TALKED ABOUT PREVIOUS EPISODE BUT IT DOES SEEM TO BE THAT AM PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT GETTING ENOUGH IODINE FOR WHATEVER REASON REALLY MEED TOO CHECK OUT WHETHER OR NOT THER IODINE LEVELS NEED TO BE INCREASED BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THEY ARE CONSUMING SO MANY PLANTS OR SO MANY MEATS AND NOT AND IN SOME CASES PLANTS THAT ACTUALY LOWER THIROAD HORMON AND NOT TO BEAT A DEAD HORSE OR CABBAGE BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT IODINE CAN DO THAT ARE POSITIVE THAT ARE S ORT OF THTHERE RELATED COTHIEROID NOT DIRECTLY THERE KIND OF OFFSHOOTS TOF THE THIEROID PATHWAY ON THEIR DOWN STREAM OF IT WE WOULD SAY ON INTERMS HOW THEY IMPACTMENTABOLIC FUNCTION ONE OF THOSE IS TO REDUCE SOMETHING CALLED SA REACTIVE PROTINE SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF SARPE OR SA REACTIVE PROTINE SE REACTIVE PROTINE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KEEP AT MODESTLY LOW LEVELS ITS ASSOCIATE WITH INFLAMMATION AND VARIOUS FORMS OF HEART DISEASE IN EVEN I DISEASE MACULAR DEGENERATION SO IT DOES APPEAR THAT A IODINE SUPPLEMENTATION OR GETTING SUFFISSIENT IODINE FROM FOOD EITHER WORKS A IS ASSOCIATED WITH A REDUCE LEVELS OF SA REACTIVE PROTNE IN THE BLOOD AND AN ANTINE FLAMMATORY EFFECT IN THE ANT AN FLAMMATORY EFFECT BRINGS US BACK TO OUR OLD FRIEND INTER LUCAN SIX REMEMBER THERE THESE INFLAMMATORY SIDAKINDS THERE YO HAVE MANY MANY NAMES BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY MANY OF THEM INTERLUCAN TEN IS THE ONE THAT'S ANTI AN FLAMMATORY INTERLUCAN SIX IS THE ONE THAT'S INFLAMMATORY ANY TIME YOU SEE I EL SIX THAT USUALLY MEANS THAT THERE'S AN INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE THERE'S A WOUND AH THERE'S INFLAMMATION OF THE BRAIN SOMEBODY IS EITHER SLEEP DEPRIVED OR HAD A BRAIN INJURY OR THEIR DEALING WITH SOME SORT OF A INFECTION ILE SIX IS KIND OF A CATCHALL FOR INFLAMMATION AND IT DOES APPEAR THAT IODINE SUPPLEMENTATION CAN REDUCE CIRCULATING ISLE SIX ASSOCIATED WITH A INFLAMMATION SO IN THAT SENSE IODINE CAN HAVE AN ANTI INFLAMMATORY EFFECT SO BY NOW IT SHOULD BE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR IF YOU CARE ABOUT PHIEROID HARMON IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE PATHWAYS THAT IT IMPACTS LIKE HAVING A HIGHLEVELMTABOLISM WHICH I GUESS IF FOR NO OTHER REASONS ATTRACTIVECAUS TAN YOU CAN EAT MORE AND STILL MAINTAIN A A HEALTHY BODY COMPOSITION BUT ALSO FOR BRAIN HEALTH COGNIV FUNCTION TISSUE REPAIR ALL THAT STUFF KEEPING SE REACTIVE PROTINE LOW KEEPING ISLES SIC SLOW MAXTURE A GETTING ENOUGH IODINE SELENIUM AN ALTIRISINE IF YOUR CURIOUS HOW THIEROID ACTUALLY INCREASES METABOLISM ALLOWS YOU TO EAT MORE ET CETERA IT RELATES TO SOMETHING RECOVERED LAST ISSUE WHICH IS GLUCOS REMEMBER WHEN YOU EAT SOMETHING BLOOD SUGAR GOES UP INSOLENT IS SECRETED FROM THE PANCREOUS AND IT MAKE SURE THAT BLOOD GLUCOES DOESN'T GO TOO HIGH WHICH CAN DAMAGE TISSUES OR TOO LOW WHICH YOU MAKE YOU HYPOGLICEMIC THIEROID INCREASES GLUCOSE UPTAKE BY VARIOUS TISSUES IN PARTICULAR MUSCLE AND BONE IT ACTUALLY CAN INCREASE BONE MINERAL DENSITY WHICH IS A REALLY GOOD THING AS YOU GET OLDER INJURIES ANY WHEN I SAY OLDER I MEAN BASILY THIRTY AND OLDER YOU THE THE REASON YOU CAN RECOVER MORE QUICKLY FROM INJURIES IF YOU HAVE A HEALTHY PHIEROID AND HEALTHY THIROID PATHWAYS IS BECAUSE YOU CAN CONCONSUME ENERGY THAT ENERGY IS DIVERTED TOWARD BONE REPAIR AND MUSCLE REPAIR IN CARTILAGE REPAIR AND SO THE WAY IT DOES THIS AGAIN IS BY INCREASING A T P BUT THE WHOLE IDEA HERE IS THAT IODINE SELENIUM ALTHIROCINE ALLOW PHIERO TO BE HEALTHY LEVELS SO THAT THIEROID THEN CAN TAKE GLUCOS IN THE BLOOD AND DIVERT IT TO TISSUES FOR IT TO BE USED IN PARTICULAR YOUR BRAIN AND THAT'S WHY THESE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SUPPLEMENTING YOURE GETTING FROM FOOD CAN ACTUALLY IN PROVE OR SUPPORT BRAIN FUNCTION PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS ASK ME WHAT IS THE FOOD THAT I SHOULD EAT FOR MY BRAIN LIKE OUR BLUEBERRIES GOOD FOR YOUR BRAIN OR THEY DO ASK ME OUR WELLNOTS GOOD FOR YOUR BRAIN CAUSE THER LOOKS LIKE A BRAIN WE TALK BY THAT EARLIER THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT WHAT YOU NEED OURE NEUTRIENTS THAT SUPPORT HORMONES AND BILOGICAL PATHWAYS THAT SUPPORT THE BRAIN THAT'S THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT AND I REALIZE WHEN PEOPLE ASK WHAT SHOULD I EAT TO SUPPORT MY BRAIN THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT THEY'RE ASKING IN SHORT FORM SO KEEPING YOUR THIEROYD HARMON HEALTHY AT HEALTHY LEVELS THAT IS IS GOING TO BE TERRIFIC FOR YOUR BRAIN BECAUSE SEMMU IFIPEROS IN YOUR METABOLISM IS FROM YOUR BRAIN THE ABILITY OF YOUR BRAIN TO USE GLUECOSTS OR KEYTONES FOR THAT MATTER IS GOING TO BE AIDED BY HAVING HEALTHY THIEROID SO DO THE THINGS TAKE THE THINGS EAT THE THINGS THAT AR CAN ALLOW YOU TO HAVE HEALTHY LEVELS OF THIEROID HARMON I'M SURE A NUMBER OF YOU ARE OUT THERE WONDERING DO I HAVE HEALTHY LEVELS OF HIEROYID HARMON THOSE CAN BE MEASURED FROM THE BLOOD THERE'E SOME TELL TELS THAT SIGNS OF HAVING REALLY HYGH THIEROID OR REALLY LOW THIEROID AND I COULD START LISTING THOSE OFF THE'RE EASY TO FIND ON LINE AS WELL THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW BULGING EYES INABILITY MAINTAIN WAIGHT SHAKY ANXIETY THAT'S ON A HYPER THIEROYD OL THINNING OF HAIR THIS KIND OF THING I I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO DIGNOSING HYPO THIEROYDISM AND HYPER THIEROYDISM IT'S JUST IN POSSIBLECAUSE THEY'RE YOU'RE THERE AND I'M HERE AND WE'RE CONE A SHOUTING BACK AND FORTH THROUGH A THUNNEL OF VIDIO AND COMMENTS IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING EXCESSIVELY HIGH OR EXCESSIVELY LOW LEVELS OF THIEROID HARMON ABSOLUTELY A LOOK UP WHAT THE SYMPTOMS ARE TALK TO YOUR PHYSICIAN U AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF GOOD TREATMENTS I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT CAN IMPROVE SYMPTOMS RELATED TO HYPO OR HYPER THIEROID OF COURSE THEY HAVE SYMPHASIZED THIEROID UM SO IF YOU DON'T MAKE ENOUGH THIEROYD YOU CAN TAKE THIEROID ITS PY PRESCRIPTION IF YOU TAKE HAVE TOO MUCH THIEROYD SOMETIMES THEY'LL TAKE OUT THE THIEROYD GLAND OR THEY CAN ADMINISTER DRUGS THAT WILL EITHER BLOCK RECEPTERS OR WILL INTERFERE WITH SOME OF THE PATHWAYS FROM THE BRAIN ON TO THE PATUITARIER FROM THE PATUITARY TO THE THIEROID IN ORDER TO ADJUST THOUGHT THIEROID HARMON THAT WAY SO THERE ARE THAT THE BIG GUNS O IN TERMS OF THE TREATMENTS FOR DIFFERENT THIROYD DISORDERS U BUT WE'RE NOT TUOING ABOUT THIROYD DISORDERS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO GET AND MAINTAIN THIEROID LEVELS IN HEALTHY RANGES AND SOME STRAIGHTFORWARD WAYS TO DO THAT THROUGH DIET AND SUPPLEMENTATION THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT FOR PEOPLE WHO MENSTRATE LEVELS OF THIEROYD HARMONE CAN FLUCTUATE DRAMATICALLY ACROSS THE MENSTRAL CYCLE SO THAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE A PROCESS OF EXPERIMENTATION I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU COULD NESC YOU COULD IN THEORY TAKE BLOOD AT DIFFERENT PHASES OF YOUR CHYCOLL AND FIGURE OUT WEATHER NOT YOUR THIEROID HARMON WAS SUCCESSIVELY HIGHER LOW AT DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE CYCLE THAT'S CAN BE PRETTY TOUGH TO DO IF YOU HAVENAN ENTER CHONOLOGIST THAT'S WILLING TO A DO THAT WITH YOU TERRIF IC THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW SUPPLEMENTING THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE OR GETTING THEM FROM FOODS RELATES TO DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THEIR CYCLE IN GENERAL THE FIRST HALF OF THE CYCLE BEFORE OVULATION PEOPLE A CRATE CARBOHYDRATES AND SWEETS MORE RELATED TO THE AND THAT MAKES TOTAL SENSE A BASED ON THE BIOLOGY OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE A FHIROID HORMONE IS GOING TO GO UP AS YOU AS ANY ONE MALE OR FEMALE MENSTRATING OR NOT INCREASES MORE STARCHI CARBOHYDRATES THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE KEITOGENIC DIETS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO SLIGHTLY LOWER THIROID LEVELS AND THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE IN KETOGENIC DIETS BLOOD GLUCOSS LEVELS ARE VERY LOW AND FHIROID HORMONE IS SECRETED IN LARGE PART IN PROPORTION TO HOW MUCH GLUCOSTS IS IN THE BLOODSTREAM AND HOW MUCH THAT BLUCLOS GLUCOS KUSE ME NEEDS TO BE REGULATED SO I'M NOT TRING TO DEMINIZE THE KETOGENICDIET I THINK ITS I DEFINLLY HAS ITS PLACE THERE ARE TWENTY TWO STUDIES NOW SHOWING THAT IT CAN DRAMATICALLY REDUCED BLOOD GLUCOS AND ABOUT A THIRD OF THOSE SHOW THAT THIROID HORMON LEVELS ARE SLIGHTLY REDUCED SOMETIMES SIGNIFICANTLY IF NOT A MORE IN THE KITOGENIC DIET THAT MAY EXPLAIN I WANT A HIGHLIGHT MAY EXPLAIN THE FACT THAT WHEN KEOPLE GO BACK TO A MORE TRADITIONAL DIET IF THEY'VE BEEN ON A KETOGENICDIET FOR A LONG TIME THAT OFTENTIMES THEY WILL GAINWAIT VERY QUICKLY AS THEY BRING CARBOHYDRATES BACK INTO THEIR DIET SOME PEOPLE ARE CYCLING BETWEEN KEITOGENIC AND ON QEITOGENIC EVERY THREE FOUR DAYS SO CALL CYCLA KEITOGENICDITES SOMEPEOPLE SAYING KEITOGENIC FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME SOME PEOPLE SIXTAYS ON ONE DAY OFF SO AS A HUGE VARIATION THERE THE POINT IS THAT CARBOHYDRATES STARCHI CARBOHYDRATES AN PRETICULAR SUPPORT THE HEALTHY PRODUCTION OF KEITHREE AND TEE FOR AND SO IF YOUARE VERY LOW CARBOHYDRATE YOUARE GOING TO HAVE A REDUCTION IN KITHREE AND TEE FOR AND SO IF YOU AREGOING TO BRING CARBOHYDRATES BACK IN TO YOUR DIET THAN YOU MIGHT WANTO DO IT MORE GRADUALLY AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT MENSTRATE AND ARE CRAVING CARBOHYDRATES IN THE EARLY PART OF THE CYCLE THAT IS ACTUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING A HEALTHY CYCLE IF ANY OF YOU HAV HAD A A HEALTHY CYCEL ON A KEITOGENICDIT THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING MAY BE LET ME KNOW THROUGH THE COMMENTS OR OR POINTI ING THE DIRECTION OF SOME RESEARCH IF YOURE AWARE OF IT SO AS YOU CAN START TO TEE THERES THIS REALLY BEAUTIFUL INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT HORMONES BETWEEN INSOLENT AND GLUCOST BETWEEN ESTROGEN AND FHYROID BETWEEN PHYROID AND A BLOOD GLUCOSE AND THE KEITOGENICDITES AT'S ALL STARTS TO FIT TOGETHER IN WAYS THAT MAKE A LOT OF CENTS ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND JUST COND OF THE CORE ELEMENTS OF WHAT THE HORMONES ARE AND THE VARIETY OF TISSUES THAT THEY WORK ON THE SIMPLE VERSION OF THIS IS IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD A CARBOHYDRATE FOR A YEAR THEN YOUR TE THREE TEE FOUR LEVELS ARE GOING TO BE PRETTY LOW AND I'M SURE THERE SOME KEITONISTOES OUT THERE THEY CUN SAY WAIT NO THIROID HORMON LEVELS GO UP WITH KEITO THAT MIGHT BE TRUE FOR OTHER REASONS INDIRECT REASONS RELATED TO HORMON PATHWAYS THAT ERE YOU KNOW CASCADE FROM BEING IN KEITOSIS FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME GREAT BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE THAT DON'T CONSUME ANY CARBOHYDRATE TEE THREE TEEFOR GON TO GO DOWN AND WHEN THEY START TO CONSUME FOODS THAT REQUIRE THIROID METABOLISM IN ORDER TO WORK WITH TO METABYLAZ THAND WAIHT GAIN CAN SOMETIMES HAPPEN MORE QUICKLY SO IS JURST SOMETHING TO CONSIDER AND IT OF SOMETHING TO WORK WITH CAREFULLY IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE SICLIT KEETOGENIC LONG TURM KEETOGENIC AND IF YOU'RE NOT KEETOGENIC AND YOURE CONSUMING CARBOHYDRATES AND THE THREE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER SELENIUM TIROSENE AND IODONE CHANCES ARE UNLESS THERE'S AN UNDERLYING CONDITION THERE THAT YOU'R LEVELS OF THIROID ARE GOING TO BE IN HEALTHY RANGE NEXT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT GROWTH HARMON GROWTH HORMON HAS RECEIVED A TON OF ATTENTION IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS ACT YOU REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS FOR SEQUENCE THIS WAS A HUGE DEAL THERE IS A HUGE PATENT DRAMO I WON'T MENTION THE UNIVERSITIES OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED THERE WERE COMPANIES AND MONSTER PATENTS AND PAY OUTS AND IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING YOU CAN NOW LOOK THAT UP WHEN LINE IF YOU ARE INTEREST N SOME O THE SCIENTIFIC HISTORY GROWTH HORMON IS A PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD ONE FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND NOW BECAUSE IT FLLOWS THE EXACT SAME LOGIC AS THIROID HARMON IN FACT THEIR FUNCTIONS ARE SO CLOSELY OVERLAPPING ON THE YOU KNOWHEN WE FIRST LOOK AT THE FACE OF IT THAT YOURE PROLEGANE THING THAN  WHY DO YOU HAVE THESE TWO SYSTEMS SO JUST VERY BRIEFLY CAN GROWTH HORMON RELEASING HORMON SO REMEMBER RELEASING MEANS IT COMES FROM THE BRAIN COMES FROM THE BRAIN AND TELLS THE PETUITARY TO RELEASE GROWTH HARMON AND THEN GROWTH HORMON IS RELEASED INTO THE BLOODSTREAM WHERE IT GOES AND ACTS ON A TON OF TISSUES MOSSEL LIGAMENTS BON FAT ET CETERA TO INCREASE METABOLISM IT SOUNDS JUST LIKE THIROID HARMON AND THEY DO WORK IN PARALLEL THAT'S WHY WE'VE LUMP THEM TOGETHER IN THE SAME EPISODE THEY INCREASE METABOLISM AND REPAIR AND GROWTH OF TISSUES ACONVERSATION ABOUT GROWTH HORMONE WOULD BE IN COMPLETE IF WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THE KIND OF EXTREMES THERE ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO ARE BORN THAT DON'T MAKE ENOUGH GROWTH HARMON AND THEY AND UP VERY SHORT IN STATURE THERE ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO MAKE A TON OF GROWTH HARMON AND THEY AND UP VERY VERY LARGE THEY TAN'T HAVE VERY LARGE APPENDAGES THEY HAVE SOMETHING CALLED A ACROMAGALLEY IT'S COMING LIKE A RIDGING OF THE ON OF THE FOREHEAD IS SUCH YY A BONE RIDGE THEY ARE GIANT AND OFF IT USED TO BE CALLED JIANTISM AND MOST PEOPLE OF COURSE ARE IN A RANGE OF HEIGHT AND A APPENDAGE LENGTH THAT DOESN'T IMPLY THAT THERE IS A GROWTH HARMONE DESRUPTION THERE GROWTH HORMON RECEIVED A LOT OF ATTENTION AFTER IT WAS SEQUENCED BECAUSE THAT MEANT THE OPPORTUNITY TO INJECT GROWTH HARMON AND REPLACE GROWH HORMON THAT WAS LOST AND THERE WAS ACTUALLY LOT OF CASES OF PEOPLE TAKING THEIRE KIDS AND TRYING TO GET THEM TO BE TALLER FOR WHATEVER REASON A MINJECTING GROWTH HARMON TO DAY WE'RE GON TO TALK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT ANY ONE CAN DO TO INCREASE GROWTH HARMON AND THEIRE REASONS WHY CERTAIN PEOPLEWOUL WANT TO DO THAT PEOPLE W OVER PRODUCE GROWTH HARMO CERTAINLY WOULD NOT WANT TO DO THAT PEOPLE UNDERPRODUSE IT WOULD OF WOULD PROBABLY WANT TO DO THAT PEOPLE THAT MAKE NORMAL QUOT IND QUOTH LEVELS OF GROWTH HORMON MIGHT WANT TO DO THAT AS THEY AGE BECAUSE DURING PUBRITY AND DEVELOPMENT THE PETUITARIES CHURNING OUT TONS OF GROWTH HORMON ITS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GROWTH NOT SURPRISING OF THE BODY AND ALL ITS FEATURES HEIGHT JUST BEING ONE OF THOSE AND SO AS WE AGE WE MAKE LESS GROWTH HORMON AND THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE RECOVER MORE SLOWLY FROM INJURIES IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE ACCUMULATE BODY FAT AND IT'S ONE OF THE REASON WHY AURE METABOLISM SLOWS AND SO GROWTH HORMON REPLACEMENT THERAPE HAS BEEN TREMENDOUSLY POPULAR IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS CIS NOT TO SAY IT DOESN'T CARRY ITS PROBLEMS IT DOES HERE IS ONE OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH INJECTING GROWTH HORMON NOT SAYING PEOPLE SHOULDN'T DO THIS IF THE DOCTOR HAS APPROVED IT OR ITS OF IN KEEPING WITH THEIR PARTICULAR LIFE GOALS BUT GROWTH HORMON IF ITS IN LEVELS THAT ARE TOO HIGH WI'LL CAUSE GROWTH OF ALL TISSUES SO NOT JUST MUSCLE NOT JUST REDUCTION OF INBODY FAT BY METABOLIZING O YOU KNOW BUT BY ALLOWING A FHATIACIDS TO BE PULLED OUT A STORAGE AND USED FOR A TP BUT IT WILL ALSO CAUSE INCREASE IN GROWTH OF THE HEART AND THE LUNGS AND THE LIVER AND THE SPLEEN AND SO THIS IS THE CONCERN WITH ABUSE OF GROWTH HORMON SO WERE NOT CAN WE TALKING ABOUT ABUSE OF GROWTH HORMON WE WILL HOWEVER TALK ABOUT TOOLS THAT ANYONE CAN USE TOO INCREASE LEVELS OF GROWTH HORMON SOME OF THEM ARE BEHAVIORAL SOME OF THEM ARE SUPPLEMENT BASED AND SOME OF THEM INTERACT WITH HEBEHAVIORS AND SUPPLEMENTS AND WHAT'S COOL ABOUT THE DISCUSSION ABOUT GROWTH HORMON IS THAT THE TOOLS THAT EXIST OUT THERE TO INCREASE GROWTH HORMON ARE VERY ACTIONABLE MOST PEOPLE CAN DO THESE WITHOUT THE NEED FOR ANY EQUIPMENT OR EVEN ANY SUPPLEMENT ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME SUPPLEMENT RELATED O THEMES FOR TOOLS FOR GROWTH HORMON INCREASE AND ALSO THE INCREASES THAT ONE CAN GET IN GROWTH HORMON ARE SUBSTANTIAL SO NORMALLY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TAKING SOMETHING AS AN EXOGINEOUS SUBSTANCE O LIKE TESTASTRONOR ASTERGEN VERSES USING SUPPLEMENTS ARE BEHAVIORS TO INCREASE THEM YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TENFOLD DIFFERENCEIS FROM I NOW ADMINISTERING THE PRESCRIPTION COMPOUND IN TERMS OF GROWTH HORMON THEIR THINGS THAT CAN INCREASE GROWTH HORMON THREE FOUR FIVE HUNDRED PER CENT OR MORE AND EVEN THOUGH THAT'S A SHORT LIVE T INCREASE THEY CAN HAVE VERY POWERFUL EFFECTS ON METABOLISM AND ON REPAIR OF TISSUES SO ATS TALK ABOUT THOSE OK LET'S GO STEP BY STEP IN TERMS OF THE THINGS THAT ANY ONE PERHAPS EVERY ONE SHOULD BE DOING IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN HEALTHY GROWTH HORMON LEVELS OR INCREASE GROWTH HORMON LEVELS UNLESS YOU HAVE OVER PRODUCTION OF GROWTH HORMON CHANCES ARE THESE THINGS ARE GOING TO BENEFIT TO YOU HOWEVER AS ALWAYS I WANT TO EMPHASIZE TALK TO A DOCTOR BEFORE YOU DO ANY YTHING INCLUDING REMOVE ANY TREATMENTS SO ANYTHING YOU WOULD ADD OR TAKE AWAY THAT'S RESPONSIBILITY OF YOU AND YURE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER I DON'T YOU SAY THAT A PROTECT ME I SAY THAT TO PROTECT YOU FIRST OF ALL GROWTH HORMON IS RELEASED EVERY NIGHT WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP AND IT'S RELEASED IN THE EARLY PART OF SLEEP DURING SO CALLED SLOW WAVE SLEEP SO THE TWO CONDITIONS THAT HAVE TO BE MET IN ORDER FOR GROWTHHORMON TO BE SECRETED REGULARLY FOR TISSUE REPAIR ET CETERA ARE YOU NEED TO GET INTO SLOW WAVE SLEEP THAT SO CALLED DEEP SLEEP AND YOU NEED BLOOD IN SLIN AND GLUCOS TO BE RELATIVELY LOW SO EATING WITHIN TWO HOURS OF SLEEP EXCUSE ME EATING WITHIN TWO HOURS OF GOING TO SLEEP IS GOING TO SUPPRESS GROWTH HORMON RELEASE THAT'S VERY CLEER HOWEVER SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS FALLING ASLEEP IF THEY ARE TOO HUNGRY SO YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH THAT AND DECIDE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO EAT AND WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO EAT THAT THING SO THAT YOU'RE NOT SO HUNGRY THAT YOUR HAVING TROUBLE FALLING ASLEEP THE EPISODES ON SLEEP THAT WERE COVERED IN EPISODES TO THREE AND FOUR OF THE HUBERMAN LAPODCAST AS I BELIEVE MORE TOOLS THERE THAN A YOU CAND EVER WANT OR MAKE USE OF IN TERMS OF HOW TO OPTIMIZE SLEEPS YOU CAN REFER TO THOSE IF YOU LIKE SO DON'T EAT TOO CLOSE TO SLEEP AND THEN GET INTO SLOW WAVE SLEEP AND AS IE DALKED ABOUT IN ONE OF THOSE EARLIER EPISODES THE FIRST HALF OF THE NIGHT SLOW WAVE SLEEP AND DEEP SLEEP PREDOMINATE THE SECOND HALF THE NIGHT IT'S ANOTHER KIND OFSLEE WE CALL REM SLEEP SO WHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT THIS EARLY PHASE OF SLEEP THIS IS HOW YOU SHOULD BE THINKING IF YOU LISTEN TO THIS PODCAST YOU SHOULD BE THINKING OK I HEAR THAT SOMETHING IS IMPORTANT IT'S RELATED IT'S IN THE PATHWAY BUT MECHANISTICALLY WHEN WE SAY GET INTO SLOW WAVE SLEEP GET INTO DEEP SLEEP THAT'S WHEN GROWTHHORMONA SECRETED THE QUESTION YOU SHOULD BE ASKING YOURSELVES AS SCIENTISTS OF YOURSELVES IS WAIT WHY SLOW WAVE SLEEP WHAT IN PARTICULAR ABOUT SLOW WAVE DEEP SLEEP ALLOWS THE PETUITARY TO RELEASE GROWTH HORMON LIKE WHAT WHAT IS IT BECAUSE IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT OF MECHANISM THERE ARE ACTUALLY WAYS THAT YOU CAN INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF GROWTHHORMON THAT YOUR RELEASE BOTH IN SLEEP AND OUT OF SLEEP SO THE ANSWER IS IT'S DELTA WAVE ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN DELTA WAVES ARE THESE BIG GIANT WAVES OF ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN THAT A CORRELATE WITH SLOW WAVES SLEEP AS SUPPOSTO FASTER WAVES OF ACTIVITY THAT ASSOCIATE WITH RAPAN I MOVEMENT SLEEP SO SLOW WAVE SLEEP AND THE DELTO ACTIVITY ACTUALLY TRIGGERS THE NURONS IN THE BRAIN THE RELEASING HORMON RIGHT GROWTHHORMON RELEASING HORMON NERONS TO TO SIGNAL TO THE PETUITARY NOW HOW DO I KNOW THIS IS TRUE AND WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH THIS WELL WE KNOW THIS IS TRUE BECAUSE RESEARCHERS HAVE TAKEN PEOPLE AND SLEEP DEPRIVE THEM AND THEY JUST ASKED WELL IS IT JUST ONE PERIOD OF TIME EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND THEN THE PETUITARY RELEASES GROWTH HORMON IF THAT WERE THE CA CE THAT WOULD SAY THAT GROWTH HORMON IS JUST RELEASED IN THA SO CALLED CERCADIAN DEPENDENT WAY EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS IS THE PULSE OF IT BUT NO IT'S ALWAYS RELATING TO SLOW WAVE DEEP SLEEP AND DELTA WAVES AND THIS IS COOL BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT MEASURING YOUR BRAINWAVES DURING SLEEP WHICH MOST YOU PROBABLY ARE NOT YOU MIGHT BE MEASURING SLOW WAVE SLEEP OR DEEP SLEEP USING A A DEVICE LIKE A WHOOP ER INORA AND EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT DURING THE DAY THEREIS THE POTENTIAL TO ALSO INCREASE GROWTH HORMONE RELEASE IF YOU CAN GET THE BRAIN INTO THE SO CALLED DELTA WAVES ND IT TURNS OUT THE ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO IN WAKING AS WELL TO INCREASE GROWTH HORMON RELEASE SO ORGAN TALK ABOUT THOSE NEXT BUT AS A TOOL AND TO JUST REALY MAKE SURE HT WE PUT BRACKETS AROUND THIS TRY AND HAVE BLOOD GLUCOS NOT TOO HIGH SO IF YOU DO NEED O EAT CLOSE TO BED YOU WOULN'T ONEY ET ANYTHING THT WOULD INCREASE BLOD LUCOSE TOO MUCH TRY AND NOT EAT TOO CLOSE TO BEDTIME GET INTO DEEP SLEEP EARLY IN THE NIGHT GET THE GROWTH HORMONE RELEASE AND UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S THE DELTA WAVES OF ACTIVITY THESE SWEEPING BIG WAVES OF ACTIVITY IN THE NURONS THAT STIMULATE THE BRAIN TO STIMULATE THE PATUITARY CAUSE ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ANCHOR TO IN TERMS OF THINKING WHAT ARE THE THINGS I CAN DO IN WAKING THAT WILL ALLOW ME TO RELEASE MORE GROWTH HORMON WHICH FOR MOST PEOPLE IS GOING TO BE A GOOD THING SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST I'VE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF MELATONAN SUPPLEMENTATION FOR MOST PURPOSES IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL UNDER CONDITIONS OF JET LAG HOWEVER THERE ARE LOTTA REASONS WHY I PERSONALLY DON'T LIKE MELATONAN IT INTERACTS WITH THE REPRODUCTIVE HORMONES TO STOSTRON AND ESTROGEN AND THAT WHOLE AXIS IN WAVS THAT ARE UNATTRACTIVE LEAST TO ME IT SUPPRESSES PUBERITY DURING DEVELOPMENT IT'S PRESENT IN MUCH MUCH HIGHER DOSES IN MOST SUPPLEMENTS THEN ONE WOULD NORMALLY MAKE LIKE HUNDREDFOLD THREE HUNDREDFOLD HOWEVER TO DAY IMAN TO TALK ABOUT AN INSTANCE WHERE VERY LOW LEVELS OF MELATONAN SUPPLEMENTATION MIGHT ACTUALLY BE ADVENTAGEOUS AND THAT IS AIDING THE TRANSITION TO THE DELTA WAVES SLOW WAVE SLEEP I JUST DESCRIBED BECAUSE THAT'S THE PATTERN OF SLEEP AND BRAINWAVE FOR ACTIVITY THAT TRIGGERS GROWTH HORMONE RELEASE SO WEREAS MOST MELETONAN SUPPLEMENTS ARE ONE MELIGRAM THREE MELEGRAMS TWELVE MELEGRAMS THIS KIND OF THING THAT IS SUPERPHYSIOLOGICAL THERE ARE SOME DATA SHOWING THAT MICROGRAM MAY BE FIVE HUNDRED MICROGRAMS OF MELATONA SO HALF A MELIGRAM CAN BE BENEFICIAL IN SHIFTING THE PATTERN OF EARLY NIGHT SLEEP TOWARD MORE OF THE SLOW WAVE DEEP SLEEP DELTA ACTIVITY AND IMPROVING GROWTH HORMONE RELEASE NOT A LOT OF STUDIES BUT THE ONES THAT I SAW ARE QUALITY OM THEY WERE DONE IN SUBJECTS THAT A YOU KNOW BOTH SEXES OM SUFFICIENT NUMBERS ET CETERA SO THIS S INTERESTING SO IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN E MELETONAN SUPPLEMENTATION YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT IT JUST IN TERN YET VERY LOW LEVELS YOU KNOW MI HUNDREDS OF MICROGRAMS THAS SUPPOSE TO THE MELIGRAM DOSAGES MOST OF THE ONE'S OUT THERE ARE GOING TO BE IN MELIGRAM DOSAGES SO THAT'S ONE WAY THAT SOME STUDIES A HAVE SHOWN THAT YOU CAN INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF GROWTH HORMONE THAT SECRETED IN EARLY PHASES OF SLEEP NOW THE DEALT AWAY OF ACTIVITY AND THE SLOW WAY OF ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN BEING VERY IMPORTANT FOR GROWTHORMON RELEASE AND GROWTHORMON RELEASE BEING SO IMPORTANT FOR METABOLIC FUNCTIONS AND PEALING AWAY UNWANTED BODY FAT AND REPAIRING TISSUES ET CETERA FORCES US TO ASK WET WHAT OTHER THINGS CAN WE DO IN WAKING IN ORDER TO INCREASE GROWTH HORMONE RELEASE SO LET'S START WITH THE ONES THAT HAVE A A POTENTIALLY BIG EFFACT BUT ARE LITTLE BIT HARDER TO ACCESS AND FOR THAT I WANT A POINT TOWARD A BOOK WHICH IS REALLY KIND OF INTERESTING IT'S NOT FOCUST ON GROWTH HORMONE BUT THE BOOK IS CALLED ALTERED TRAITS THIS IS THE BOOK OM IT'S AN EXCELLENT BOOK ON ALTER TRAITS BY GOLLMAN AND DAVIDSON SCIENCE REVEALS HOW MEDITATION CHANGES YOUR MINE BRAIN AND BODY VERY INTERESTING BOOK A FOR THOSE OF EITHEIR INTERESTIN MEDITATION AND PERHAPS THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE NOT BUT ARE CONSIDERING IT THEY WHAT THEY TALK ABOUT IN THIS BOOK IS THE FACT THAT MEDITATION HAS TWO SEPARATE LINES OF EFFACTS ONE OF THOSE LINES OF EFFCTS ARE THINGS THAT CHANGE YOUR STATE SO YOUR STREST YOU SIT DOWN YOU MEDITATE AND YOU RELAX IN YOU GOING TO PARTICULAR STATE THE OTHER ARE THE CHANGES THAT OCCUR OVER TIME AND THOSE ARE CHANGES IN TRAIT SO PERSONALITY CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE WITH LONG BOUTS OF OF OF T M MEDITATION OR REPEATED MEDITATION IN ANY CASE THE REASON WERE TALKING ABOUT ALTER TRAITS TO DAY IS BECAUSE CERTAIN TYPES OF MEDITATION CAN GET PEOPLE'S BRAINS INTO STATES THAT VERY CLOSELY MIMIC SLOW WAVE SLEEP IF YOU HEAR SNORING IN THE BACKGROUND COS STELHOIS SEMSICIES IN SLOWAY SLEEP THESE BIG OCILATORY SNORES O THAT HE'S IN TWENTY THREE POINT SIX HOURS PER DAY SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS FOR FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE INTERESTED IN INCREASING GROWTH HORMONE A MEDITATION PRACTISE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO GET INTO THESE SLOWWAVE DELTA TYPE FREQUENCY A ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN MAY BE VERY BENEFICIAL BECAUSE AS I MENTION BEFORE THAT'S WHAT'S GATING GROWTH HORMONE RELEASE IT'S NOT JUST THE CIRCADIAN PHENOMENON ITS ACTUALLY CONTROL BY THESE A BRAINWAVES I DID LOOK UP BY NORAL BEATS I GET SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT BY NORAL BEATS AND IT'S A REALLY ATTRACTIVE IDEA RIGHT BY NORAL BEATS FOR THOSE YOU DON'T KNOW YOU LISTEN TO ONE FREQUENCY OF TONE DO    IN ONE EAR AND ANOTHER FREQUENCY OF TONE AN THE OTHER YARE DOTOTO AND THEN THE THE BRAIN ESSENTIALLY TAKES THE AVERAGE OF THE TO OR THERE' SOME THERE SOME OTHER WIRING IN THE BRAINSTEM THAT MAKES IT NOT QUITE THE AVERAGE BUT TAKES THE THE AVERAGE OF THE TO FOR SAKE OF DISCUSSION AND THAT FREQUENCE IS WHAT THE BRAIN IN TRAI AINS OR MAPS ON TO THERE AR ARE A LOT OF APTS THAY ARE CLAIMING THAT YOU CAN GET THE BRAIN INTO DELTA WAVES USING BY NORAL BEATS I COULD NOT FIND QUALITY PURE REVIEW STUDIES SUPPORTING THAT BUT I KNOW THEIR LOT OF FANS OUT THERE OF BY NORAL BEATS IF YOU KNOW OF ANY LITERATURE THAT'S INDEPENDENT OF THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THE BY NORAL BEAT TECHNOLOGY SO UNBIASD RESEARCH PLEASE SEND IT MY WAY BUT IN ALTER TRAITS ON GOMAN AND DAVIDSON TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WHO DO TWENTY MINUTES OF SITTING MEDITATION PER DAY CAN AXCESS THESE SLOW WAVES SLEEP LIKE A BRAINSTATES NOW I'VE TALKED A LOT ON HERE ABOUT NON SLEEP DEEP REST ON THINGS LIKE YOGONEDRA AND HYPNOSIS I'M NOT AWARE THAT THOSE WILL PUT PEOPLE INTO SLOW WAVES SLEEP PER SAY ORE DELTA WAVES PERSAY SO WE TALKING ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES OF MORE TRADITIONAL TYPT MEDITATION O CASE O WE TALKED ABOUT VERY LOW DOSES OF MALETONAN AS A WAY TO TRIGGER DELTA WAVES AND MORE GROWTHHORMON RELEASE IN SLEEP THEIR SCIENCE TO SUPPORT THAT WEVE WEVE NOW TALKED ABOUT A WAKING BEHAVIOR OF TWENTY MINUTES OF SO OF WHAT I WUL CALL STANDARD MEDITATION ARE JUST SITTING THERE CONCENTRATING ON ONE'S BREATHING TO TRY AND ACCESS DELTA WAVES BINERAL BEATS NO SCIENCE YET WHO KNOWS MAYBE THEIR SCIENCE TO SUPPORT IT IF YOU'RE AWARE OF IT LET ME KNOW NOW LET'S MOVE TO THE THINGS THAT ONE CAN DO THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE WHAT'S LESS JUST BEYON UST I PRETTY ENORMOUS EFFECTS ON GROWTHHORMON RELEASE IN WAKING AND THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE VERY ACTIONABLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAN HAVE A DRAMMATIC EFFECT ON LEVELS OF GROWTHHORMON RELEASE IN WAKING AS WELL AS IN SLEEP THE FOLLOWING NIGHT IS EXERCISE BUT THE KEY IS THE TYPE OF EXERCISE AND THE DURATION NOW THERE'S A LOGIC TO THIS THERE ARE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF STUDIES MEASURING GROWTH HORMON BOTH DURING OR SOMETIMES AFTER EXERCISE OR THE FOLLOWING NIGHT AND THE CONCLUSION THAT ONE TAKES AWAY FROM ALL THESE IS THAT EXERCISE HAS TO BE OF PARTICULAR DURATION AND INTENSITY IN ORDER TO GET GROWTH HORMON RELEASE SO FIRST IMJUSCAN TO TELL YOU WHAT I FOUND TO BE THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF GROWTHHORMON RELEASE AS IT RELATES TO A PARTICULAR FORM OF EXERCISE THE PARTICULAR FORM OF EXERCISE IS EITHER WAIGHT TRAINING OR IT CAN BE ENDURANCE TRAINING BUT THE ENDURANCE TRAINING AND THE WAIGHT TRAINING ACTALY HAVE TO BE LIMITED TO ABOUT SIXTY MINUTES NOT MUCH LONGER NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SHOWN OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT IF ONE EXERCISES TOO LONG WITH WAITS OR ENDURANCE EXERCISE THAT CORTES ALL LEVELS GO HIGH ENOUGH THAT IT STARTS TO INHIBIT THE TESTASTERONE AND EVEN THE ESTROGEN PATHWAYS THIS IS WHY I BELIEVE PEOPLE WHO OVER EXERCISE OR EXERCISE A LOT CAN LOSE THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLES THEY STOP MENSTRATING S WHY YOU GET SUPPRESSIONS IN TO STASTRONE IF PEOPLE TRAIN TOO LO NG IN TOO HARD THE CUT OFF HAS ALWAYS BEEN YOU KNOW SIXTY TO CEVENTY FIVE MINUTES OF THE HARD WORK PART IT'S GOETET A VERY A LOT FROM PERSON A PERSON BUT IN TERMS OF GROWTH HORMON THE CONDITIONS THAT SEEM TO LEAD TO THE GREATEST GROWTHRORMAN RELEASE IT ARE ONE GET WARM THIS IS INTERESTING WERE IN TALK ABOUT TEMPERATURE SO A PROPER WARM UP SEEMS TO ACCELERATE THE RELEASE OF GROWTH HORMON ONCE THE HARD WORK PHASE STARTS SA TEN MINUTES OF WARM UP OR SO WAS THE NUMBER THAT I EXTRACTED FROM ALL THESE STUDIES IS A BEAUTIFUL REVIEW ON THIS BY THE WAY A GROWTH HORMON RESPONSES AVERING DO ASCUES ME UM GROWTHHORMN ARGENINE AND EXERCISE WILL TALK ABOUT ARGENINE IN A FEW MINUTES THAT'S BY CANNILY KA A N A L E WY IT WAS PUBLISH IN CURRENT OPINION IN CLENICAL NUTRITION AND METABOLIC CLAYR THE CURRNT OPINION JOURNALS ARE ARE GENERALLY OF PRETTY HIGH QUALITY UM IN TERMS OF THE REVIEWS JUST BECAUSE THEY TEND TO BE PRETTY RESENT AND THEN THE REFERENCES THEREIN A ARE ALSO QUITE GOOD SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN THIS MEANS WARM UP AND WHEN YOU SAY WARM UP IT DOESN'T MEAN JUST WARM UP THE LIMBS AND TISSUES THATYOU'RE GOING TO USE YOU DON'T GET INJURED AECTUALLY WARM O THE BODY SO THERE WAS ACTALY SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER NOT IN COLD WINTER MONTHS PEOPLE SHOULD WEAR LIKE A A STOCKING CAP BRINGING THE CONDITIONS A OF MAKING THE ROOM WARM SO GETTING THE BODY WARM AS A WARM UP SEEMS TO BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE TEMPERATURE OF THE BODY SEEMS TO BE AN IMPORTANT CONDITION OR PREREQUISIT FOR CERTAIN PATTERNS OF EXERCISE TO MAXIMIZE GROWTHHORMON RELEASE SIYCE REALLY INTERESTING TO ME I HAVE AN OBSESSION WITH HOW BODY TEMPERATURE LIGHT EXERCISE AND FOOD INTERRACT WE'RE GOING RIGHT THERE WITH THE FACT THAT IF YOU GET WARM YOU BRING UP THE BODY TEMPERATURE A DEGREE OR TOO OR MAY BE THREE AND THEN START EXERCISE IT DOES APPEAR THAT HIGH INTENSITY EXERCISE BUT NOT AGAIN AS IN DISCUSTED IN A PREVIOUS EPISODE NOT EXERCISE THAT BRINGS MUSCLES TO FAILURE BUT CLOSE TO IT SO IF IT'S WEIGHT BEARING EXERCISE IT WOULD BE GETTING CLOSE TO THAT A FINAL REPETITIONS WHERE YOU CAN'T COMPLETE THEM BUT NOT PUSHING THROUGH THOSE OR EVEN GOING TO FAILURE BUT GETTING CLOSE LEADS TO ANYWHERE FROM THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED PER CENT INCREASES IN RESTING GROWTHHORMON LEVELS AND THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED PER CENT INCREASES IN GROWTH HORMON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP WHICH IS INCREDIBLE NOW I WANE TO DISSECT THIS PROPERLY O CASO ONE OF THE OTHER CONDITIONS THAT SEEM TO BE IMPORTANT AGAIN WAS TO HAVE RELATIVELY LOW BLOOD GLUCOSE SO IT LOOKS LOOKING A LOT LIKE THE CONDITIONS YOU NEED FOR SLEEP IN ORDER TO GET MAXIMUM GROWTHHORMON RELEASE IN SLEEP SO NOT HAVING BLOOD GLUCOS TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW THAT'S A DISCUSSION UNTO ITSELF YOU WANT O HAVE SUFFICIENT ENERGY TO DO THE EXERCISE BUT GETTING WARM NOT HAVING BLOOD GLUCOS TOO HIGHER TOO LOS ARE PROBABLY NOT EATING TOO CLOSE TO EXERCISE OR N OT IN GJESTING A LOT OF SUGARS DURING THE EXERCISE THAT WAS SUPPORTED BY THE FACT THAT INGESTION OF A SPORT STRENGTH THAT CONTAINS COLORIC SUGAR IMMEDIATELY FLAT LINED THE GROWTH HORMON LEVELS REALLY INTERESTING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSOLENT GLUKOS AND GROWTH HORMON SO THEN DOING THE TRAINING FOR ANYWHERE FROM SIXTY TO SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES TO MACIMISE GROWTHHORMON RELEASE AND THEN THE OTHER INTERESTING THING WAS THAT EVEN AFTER THE EXERCISE TAKING BODY TEMPERATURE BACK DOWN TO NORMAL LEVELS RELATIVELY QUICKLY SEEM TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE BIG SPIKES IN GROWTH HORMON OTHERWISE WHAT WOULD HAPPENS GET THESE BIG SPIKES IN GROWTH HORMON BUT IF THE EXERCISE WENT TOO LONG OR IF BODY TEMPERATURE REMAIN TOO HIGH FOR TOO LONG THEN YOU DIDN'T GET THE SECOND INCREASE IN GROWTH HARMON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT ISO I HOPE I MADE THAT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR WARM UP WELL GET BODY TEMPERATURE UP EXERCISE SIXTY TO SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES DON'T GO TO ABSOLUTE FAILURE IF YOURE INTEREST IS IN GROWTH HOARMN O RELEASE BOTH DURING THE EXERCISE AND LATER THAT NIGHT AND IF YOU CAN BRING BODY TEMPERATURE BACK DOWN TO NORMAL LEVELS BY COOLING OFF MAY BE COOL SHOWER MAY BHE ICE PACK OR SOMETHING OR MAY BE JUST ONTURNING A OFF THE HEAT IN THE ROOM ORE GOING OUTSIDE WHATEVER IT IS THEN YOU INCREASE THE PROBABILITY THA YOU'RE GOING TO INCREASE GROWTH HORMON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT AS WELL AND AGAIN THESE ARE BIG INCREASES THREE HUNDRED OF FIVE HUNDRED PER CENT IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE GETTING A SECOND SLEEP DURING THE DAY BUT IF THE EXERCISE IS TOO HARD IF BODY TEMPERATURE STAYS TOO HIGH FOR TOO LONG YOU DESRUPT THE WHOLE PROCESS AND YOU DON'T GET THE EFFECT OF INCREASED GROWTH HORMON GROWTH HORMON IS REALLY POWERFUL BUT IT DOESN'T WORK ALONE I FACT A LOT OF THE EFFECTS OF GROWTHHORMN ARE MEDIATED BY ITS EFFECTS ON THE LIVER SO GROWTH HORMO'S RELEASE GOS TO TH LIVER AND THEN THE LIVER RELEASE IS SOMETHING CALLED IG F ONE INSOLENT GROWTH FACTOR ONE INSOLENT GROWTH FACT OR ONE WAS POPULAR AND THE NARROSCIENCE COMMUNITY AS AN AREA FOCUS BECAUSE OF ITS ABILITY TO TRIGGER IMPROVEMENTS IN MEMORY AND LEARNING AFTER EXERCISE AND INDEED EXERCISE TRIGERS BOTH THE RELEASE OF GROWTH HORMON AND IGIF ONE IGF ONE SEEMS RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF TE EFFECTS OF IMPROVED MEMORY SOME PEOPLE A REPORT THAT THAT IS DUE TO INCREASE NUMBER OF NURONS OR NUROGENESIS BIRWTH OF NEWNERONS IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAN HUMANS THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING YES AND ANIMALS NOT IN HUMAN'S IGEIF ONE NONE THE LESS HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON MEMORY AND COGNITION AND A GREAT WAY TO TRIGGER IGEIF ONE RELEASE IN GROWTH HORMON RELEASE IS THROUGH EXERCISE NOW THE INTERESTING THING AND THE REASON O BRINGING UP IGF ONE HERE IS THAT CERTAIN PATTERNS OF EXERCISE ACTUE DURATION OF EXERCISE HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON IGEF ONE AND GROWTH HORMON DEPENDING ON WHETHER OR NOT THE EXERCISE IS DONE BY MEN OR WOMEN THERE'S WHAT WE CALL A SEX DEPENDENT EFFECT AND THIS EXTOPETINENT EFFECT IS AS FOLLOWS IN THIS PARTICULAR STUDY AND SEVERAL OTHERS WHAT THEY WHAT THEY DID AS THEY HAD PEOPLE EXERCISE THEY MEASURED GROWTH HORM N AND IGI A ONE LEVELS FROM THE BLOOD BEFORE JURING AND AFTER EXERCISE AND THEY COULD SEE WHEN THERE THE GREATEST INCREASE HAS OCCURRED THIS WAS STANDARD A SORTS OF RESISTANCE EXERCISE SO SOME SQUATS A THERE WAS A A THERE WAS A A SPRINTLIKE ACTIVITY  IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT THE WHAT THE SPECIFIC A EXERCISES WERE I'M NONE OF THEM WERE TO FAILURE THESE WERE IN KIND OF THE TEN  REPETITION OR LESS RANGE A SIXSETS AGAN A STANDARD WEIGHT TRAINING STUFF THAT AM ANY ONE MIGHT DO A BUT WHAT WAS INTERESTING IS THAT WOMEN WERE ABLE TO ACCESS THE BIGGEST PEAK IN GROWTH HORMON AND IGIEF ONE EARLY IN THE EXERCISE WHO IN THE FIRST THIRTY MINUTES SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS EVEN A IF YOU JUST HAVE THIRTY MINUTES A AT LEAST FOR WOMEN THERE'S GOING TO BE A BIG INCREASE IN GROWTH HORMON AND IGIF ONE IN THE FIRST THIRTY MINUTES FOR MEN THE BIGGEST INCREASE OCCURRED LATER IN THE A IN THE EXERCISE A WHICH WAS A SIXTY MINUTES OR SO TOTAL AND SO A THESE SEX DEPENDENT EFFECTS ARE INTERESTING THEY POINT TO THE FACT THAT THINGS LIKE CORTES ALL TESTERAOSTRON AND ESTEROGEN WHICH ACCOURSE VERY INDIFFERENT LEVELS AND MEN IN WOMEN ARE GOING TO IMPACT THE RELEASE OF THINGS LIKE IGIEF ONE AND GROWTH HORMON AND YES THEY DID CONTROL FOR ALL SORTS OF THINGS LIKE DIET AND THEY CONTROLLED FOR WEIGHT AND PRIOR EXPERIENCE ITS USSUALLY QUITE NICE STUDY IF YOU LIKE TO CHECK IT OUT IT'S BY A PIERCE AT ALL A GROWTH HORMON INSOLEN GLOFACTOR ONE MOLECULAR WAY I SUFORM RESPONSE TO RESISTANCE EXERCISE ARE SEX DEPENDENT IN FRONTIERS IND INTO CHRONOLOGY FIND JOURNAL IN TWENTY TWENTY SO IT'S QUITE RECENT SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN THIS MEANS IF YOU'RE EXERCISING AND YOU WANT GROWTH HORMON RELEASE WARM UP DO THE TYPE OF EXERCISE WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING WOMEN IN THE FIRST THIRTY MINUTES AS WHEN YOU'RE GINTO GET THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT IN TERMS OF GROWTH HOARMON AND IGEF ONE MEN YOU HAVE TO KEEP GOING FOR THE ENTIRE A SIXTY MINUTES SO DON'T TAP OUT EARLY IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN GETTING THE GROWH HORMON AND IGEF ONE RELEASE AND THE SAME CONDITIONS APPLY ABOUT THEN COOLING DOWN AND NOT MAKING TH EXERCISE LAST SO LONG THE YOU DON'T GET THE INCREASING GROWTH HORMON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT MY EXPERIENCE THUS FAR IN DOING THIS PODCAST IS THAT PEOPLE FALL INTO ONE OF TWO CATEGORIES THERE ARE THE JUST TELL ME WHAT TO TAKE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE REALLY EAGER TO TRY SUPPLEMENTS AND MAYBE IN PRESCRIPTION COMPOUNDS AND THEN THE ARE PEOPLE WHO ALOBIT MORE SHY ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION THEY ARE MORTH FOCUSTD ON WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH DIET AND BEHAVIORS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT OUNT OF A BIAS EITHER WAY I TRY ND OFF FOR TOOLS I'M THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AND I ALWAYS POINT TO SAFETY MARGINS A THERE ARE SUPPLEMENTS THAT CAN INCREASE GROWTH HORMON TO A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE AND NO THESE AREN'T GROWTH HORMON ITSELF ALTHOUGH THAT OF COURSE WILL INCREASE GROWTH HORMON TO CONSIDERABLE DEGREET WE WILL TALK ABOUT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AT THE END NOT JUST GROWTH HORMON BUT SOME OTHER THINGS THAT ARE QUITE PROMINENTLY IN USE RIGHT NOW IN PARTICU LER IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AM THEREIT'S PRETTY INTERESTING COMPOUNDS BUT FIRSTLESS TALK ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS SO THIS BEEN KNOWN ABOUT FOR SOME TIME BUT AM ARGNINE THE EMENOACID ARGENINE AS WELL AS THE EMINOACID ORNATHINE CAN INCREASE GROWTH HORMON LEVELS SUBSTANTIALLY NOW ARGENINE HAS A NUMBER OF EFFECTS YOU CAN GET IT FROM FOOD YOU CAN GET IT FROM SUPPLEMENTS SOME PEOPLE TAKE IT IN PILLFORM OR CAPSIL FORM SOME PEOPLE WILL ACTIUTAKE IT BY IVY BUT INTERVENEOUSLY THE LEVELS AND THE AMOUNTS OF GROF ARGNINE REQUIRED TO GET BIG GROWTHHORMON RELEASE INCREASES IS PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL SO SOME PEOPLE WILL TAKE ARGENINE BEFORE BEDTIME SOME PEOPLE TAKE IT BEFORE EXERCISE THE PREREQUISITE AGAIN IS LOW BLOOD GLUCOST BLUGLUCOSIS HIGH ITS CAN A QUASH THE EFFECT THE AMOUNTS OF ARGENINE THAT PEOPLE TAKE ARE ANYWHERE FROM THREE GRAHMDS TO TEN GRAHMS ARE SOMETIMES EVEN MORE ALTHOUGH THIS IS DEFINLY A CASE OF MORE IS NOT BETTER THERE IS A THRESHOLD AT WHICH GROWTHHORMON RELEASES ACTUALLY BLUNTED BY TAKING MORE THAN NINE GRAHMS OF ARGENIE NOW NINE GRAMS OF ARGENINE ORLY IS A LOT OF PILLS IS AT MINIMUM NINE PILLS AND IT CAN CAUSE SOME GEI DISTURBANCE HITE PEOPLE CAN FEEL NAUCIOUS SOME PEOPLE THROW IT UP SOME PEOPLE GET SOME A CONSTIPATION OR DIARRHOEA ET CETERA OR JUST STOMACH ACES I'M CERTAINLY NOT SUGGESTING PEOPLE DO THIS THAT THEYRE NOT A THAT THEY TAKE ARGNINE BUT THAT'S THE REASON WHY MOST OF THE STUDIES THAT LOOKED AT THE ROLL OF ARGENINE ON GROWTHROMON LEVELS DID IT BY AM IVY INTERVENOUS INFUSION SO WHAT'S INTERESTING HOWEVER IS THAT WEATHER NOT ITS BY MOUTH OR BY VAINE TAKING ARGENINE CAN DRAMATICALLY INCREASE GROWTHHORMON RELEASE AND THE LEVELS OR THE AMOUNT OF INCREASE RAISE A WAS ANYWHERE FROM ONE HUNDRED ON THE LOW END BUT ANYWHERE FROM BASICALLY FROM FOUR HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED PERCENT ABOVE BASELINE THESE ARE HUGE INCREASES IN GROWTH HORMON NOW I'VE NEVER TRIED ARGENINE AM ARGENINE IS OUT THERE FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PURPOSES ONE OF THEM IS TO INCREASE GROWTHORMON AN SOME OF THE SUPPLEMENTS OUT THERE A TO INCREASE GROWTHROMAN INCLUDE ARGENINE AND ORNTHINE ARGENINE DOES HAVE THE EFFECT OF OF DILATING ARTERIALS AND IT BASELY INCREASES BLOOD SUPPLY ARGEN THE ARGENINE PATHWAYS INVOLVED IN VEZO DILATION IT'S ACTUALLY THE PATHWAY THAT'S DOWN STREAM OF A LOT OF DRUGS THAT ARE USED TO A TREAT THINGS LIKE A RECTILE TIS FUNCTION AND A ANY TIME PEOPLE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH A PRIFERAL BLOOD FLOW OF ANY KIND THEY A FOCUS ON COMPOUNDS THAT WILL EITHER DISTRUPT THE ENZIMES OR WILL ADJUST THE LEVELS OF AMENOACES TO GET MORE VAS O DILATION SO TAKING ARGENINE FOR THE PURPOSE OF INCREASIN GROWTH HORMON WILL ALSO HAVE THE EFFECT OF DILATING BLOOD VESSELS AND FOR YEU WILL BLOOD EXCUSE ME WITH HEARTG CONDITIONS THAT THAT ACTUALLY CAN BE A A SERIOUS ISSUE NOW HERE IS SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT AND INTERESTING TO NOTE WHICH IS THAT INCREASING ARGENINE LEVELS WITH THE SPECIFIC GOAL OF INCREASING GROWTH HORMONE RELEASE CAN ACTUALLY SHORT CIRCUIT THE EFFECTS OF EXERCISE ON GROWTH HORMONSSEVERAL STUDIES I LOOKED AT LOOKED AT THE INTERACTION OF TAKING ARGENINE END THE EXERCISE OR JUST THE ARGENINE OR JUST THE EXERCISE ALONE AND SO YOU DON'T A UNFORTUNATELY IF GROWTHORMON INCREASES YOUR GOAL YOU DON'T UNFORTUNAELY GET TO INCREASE GROWTH HORMON EIGHT HUNDRED PERCENT BY TAKING ARGENINE AN EXERCISING IT ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE CLAMPED AT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED PERCENT INCREASES STILL LARG INCREASES SO I MAKE THAT POINT FOR CSEVERAL REASONS FIRST OF ALL BE AWARE THAT ARGENINE HAS THESE OTHER EFFECTS ON VAS OF DILATION TAKE THOSE SERIOUSLY IF YOU HAVE A HART CONDITION OR TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY IN ANY CASE SECOND OF ALL YOU CAN SUPPLEMENT WITH ARGENINE NOT EXERCISE END GET THESE BIG INCREASES IN GROWTHORMON BY TAKING THEM BEFORE SLEEP BUT IF YOUR TAKING THE ARGENINE BEFORE EXERCISE YOU ARE GOING TO SHORT CIRCUIT OR CLAMPED THE EFFECTS OF EXERCISE ON GROWTH HORMON SO IT SOMETHING THAT ONE COULD USE BUT IT DOESN'T A HAVE A SENERGISTIC EFFECT WITH EXERCISE AND THE TWO A MORE O LESS CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT OM NOT TO ZERO BUT YOU END UP WITH THE SAME EFFECT YOU WOULD HAD YOU DONE ONE OR THE OTHER SOFULLY THAT'S CLEAR THE OTHER THING IS IF ONE'S GOAL IS REALLY TO INCREASE ARGENINE IN THE BLOOD FOR WHATEVER REASON ARGENINE MAY NOT ACTUALLY BE THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT BECAUSE OF THE WAY ITS METABOLIZED IN THE GUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS OR GET ACCESS TO THE TISSUES THAT YOUR MOST INTERESTED IN IN TERMS OF INCREASING GROWTH HRORMON ORVAS A DILATION FOR THAT MATTER AND IN THAT CASE THERES SOMETHING ELSE CALLED ELCITRALINE WHICH HAS POWERFUL EFFECTS ON ON VASE O DILATION POWERFUL EFFECTS ON A POTENTIALLY ON A GROWTHORMON LEVELS VIE THE ARGENINE PATHWAY BUT BASILY ELCITURALINE ACTS A SORT OF A DONER OR LETS ITS CONT OF A BIOLOGICAL PREREQUISITE FOR ARGENINE AND CAN LEAD TO EVEN BIGGER ARGENINE INCREASES THEN YOU WOULD GET IF YOU TOOK ARGENINE ITSELF AND SO ARGE A ELSECITRLINE IS OUT THERE KEEP IN MIND THAT ANYTHING THAT DILATES THE BLOOD VESSELS WILL LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE SO ELSE CITURALINE YES WILL LEAD TO INCREASE BLOOD FLOW FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE YOU ONTLY USE IT FOR ON WHETHERANOT THAT PUMPS IN THE GEMER WHATEVER OM IT ALSO CAN LEAD TO BIG INCREASES IN ARGENINE AND GROWTH HORMON BUT IT WILL LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE SO BE AWARE OF THAT BUT A AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE BIOLOGY ISN'T SO STRAIGHTFORWARD ELSE CITURALINE MAY ACTUALY BE T E BETTER WAY TO GET ARGENINE INCREASES THAN ARGENINE ITSELF AND ORNATHINE CAN ALSO INCREASE GROWTH HORMON ALTHOUGH THAT'S ALSO THROUGH AN INDIRECT PATHWAY AND NOWADAYS THERE ISN'T A LOT OF FOCUS ON ORNATHINE AS A WAY TO INCREASE GROWTH HORMON THAT WAS ALL THE RAGE IN THE NINETIES NOT SO MUCH ANY MORE NOWADAYS THAT PEOPLE ARE REALLY IN THE NO FOR THE STUFF UM TEN TO FOCUS ON EL CITERLINE AND IF YOUR INTERESTED IN ELCITRELINE OR ARGENINE I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU GO TO OUR OLD FRIEND GOOD FRIENDS EXAMINE DOT CALM BECAUSE THERE YOU CAN PUT IT IN TO THE LIST YOU CAN JUST PUT SEARCH AND ITS TOTALLY FREE UM AND IT WILL TELL YOU THAT BLOOD PRESSURE WILL BE SLIGHTLY DECREASED POWER OUTPUT IN THE GEN WILL INCREASE THERE'S VERY STRONG EFFECTS ON BLOOD LUCOS FATIGUE IS REDUCED NOTABLY BIG INCREASES IN NITOXIDE THAT'S ALSO RELATED TO THE INCREASE IN VASO DILATION PLASMA ARGENINE VERY HIGE UM EFFAT THA EXCUSE ME NOTABLE EFFECTS ON VERY HIGH SUPPORT FOR STUDIES HICH ALLOW PEOPLE MORE TRAINING VOLUME WROTE BIC EXERCISE ARTERIAL STIFFNESS IS BROUGHT DOWN THERE'S A HUGE LIST OF THINGS INCREASE IN GROWTH HORMON SO TWO STUDIES SHOWING A THIS WAS DONE DOUBLE BLIND GREAT YOU ALWAYS ONCE SEE DOUBLE BLIND PLUCIBL CONTROLLED THIS WAS ONLY DONE IN MALES NOT IN FEMALES UNFORTUNATELY JUST HAVE A DATA FROM MALES BUT INCREASES IN GROWTH HORMON IT'S A SMALL BUT A REAL SIGNIFICANT EFFECT AND AGAIN FROM QUALITY STUDIE SO THERE'S A HUGE NUMBER OF EFFECTS THERE UM AND SOME OF THE OTHER KIND OF MORE INTERESTING ONES ABOUT ELCITRLINE THAT YOU MIGHT NOT UM HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT OR THINGS LIKE MUCK MUSCLE OXYGENATION UM AS WE SCROLL DOWN DECREASES IN SEE REACTIVE PROATINE SO A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT EFFECT A EXPECT SCUSE ME FROM THE SAME SORTS OF COMPOUNDS WE SAW BEFORE THE TAKE AWAY HERE IS IF YOU WANT TO INCREASE GROWTH HORMON THINK ABOUT THE ARGENINE PATHWAY BUT ARGENINE ITSELF MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST DIRECT ROUT TO GET THERE ELL CITRELINE MIGHT BE A BETTER OPTION BUT PLEASE DO CONSIDER AND TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY THE EFFECTS ON BLOOD PRESSURE SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BIG EFFECTS FROM SUPPLEMENTATION OR EXERCISE ON GROWTH HORMON THIS EXTREMELY POWERFUL HORMONE AND ONE THING TO NOTE IS THAT THE PROFILE OF GROWTH HARMON AS WE AGE CHANGES I MENTION THAT EARLIER BUT IT'S PORTED UNDERSTAND HOW IT CHANGES WHEN ONE THING THAT'S PARTICULARLY INTERESTING TO ME AS SOMEBODY WAS IN IS FORTIES IS THAT IT'S ACHALLY BETWEEN AGES THIRTY AND FORTY THAT THE AMOUNT OF GROWTH HORMONE THAT YOU RELEASE EACH NIGHT IS REDUCED BY TO TO THREEFOLD THAT'S REALLY INCREDIBLE YOU KNOW YOU WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT TESTASTERONE LEVELS GOING DOWN AS WE AGE OR ESTERGEN LEVELS GOING DOWN BUT IF YOU RECALL FROM THE TESTASTERON AND ESTROGEN EPISODE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT THE DATA JUST FOR INSTANCE ON TESTASTRONE THERE ARE MEN IN THEIR NINETIES AND THEY ARE NOT RARE IT TURNS OUT THAT ARE MAKING AS MUCH TESTOSTERON AND D H T DIHYDROTISTOCTERON AS THEY WERE IN THEIR TWENTIES  SO WE HEAR SO MUCH NOW DAYS ABOUT HOW TESTOSTERON LEVELS ARE DROPPING SPIRM LEVELS ARE DROPPING ET CETERA AND I DON'T DISPUTE THAT I I TALKED ABOUT THAT IN THAT EPISODE BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT TESTOSTERON LEVELS VERY TREMENDOUSLY FROM PERSON TO PERSON AND JUST GETTING OLDER DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT TESTOSTERON LEVELS ARE DROPPING GROWTH HORMON LEVELS IT SEEMS ARE DROPPING WHEN PEOPLE ARE IN THEIR THIRTIES AND FORTIES AND THEIRE DROPPING SUBSTANTIALLY AND THAT'S SEEMS TO BE THE CASE ACROSS THE BORDYOU JUST NOCK IN A FINE PEOPLE IN THEIR FORTISE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES THAT ARE MAKING AS MUCH GROWTH HORMON AS THEY WERE IN THEIR TEENS IN TWENTIES AND AS SOMEBODY WHO I FEEL REALLY GOOD BUT AS SOMEBODY WHO U'M DEFILLY NOTICE THAT AS I GOT INTO MY FORTIES THAT EVEN IF I SLEPT THE SAME AMOUNT I WASN'T FEELING QUITE AS I WOULD SAY U'M ABLE TO RECOVER FROM EXERCISE OR WOUND HEALING EVEN WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF SLEEP AND OS TRY TO OPTIMIZE A GREAT NUMBER OF THINGS THIS BUSINESS OF GROWTH HORMON BECAME OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO ME AND SINCE THE WAYS TO MANIPULATE GROWTH HORMON IN MEN AN WOMEN ARE SO STRAIGHT FORWARD AND SINCE EVERYBODY GOES THROUGH THIS AGE RELATED TO CLINE VERY DRAMATICALLY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE THINGS THAT WERE SUPOSED TO BE DOING ANYWAY LIKE EXERCISING LIKE TRINOTE TOO CLOSE TO BEDTIME TRY TO OPTIMIZE SLEEP ALL OF THESE ARE WONDERFUL TOOLS THAT WE SHOULD UM BE PURSUING AND PERHAPS USING AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY OFFSET THE TWO TO THREEFOLD DECREAS RIGHT IF WE'RE TALKING BOUT A TWO TO THREEFOLD DECREASE FOR PEOPLE THERE IN THE THIRTIES AND FORTIES AND THEM WERE TALKING ABOUT INCREASES FROM EXERCISE OR FROM MAY BE FROM SUPPLEMENTATION BUT CERTAINLY FROM EXERCISE OF THREE HUNDRED O FIVE HUNDRED PERCENT WELL THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE'RE IN A POSITION TO ACTUALLY OFFSET THE AGE RELATED TO CLINEING GROWTH HORMON COMPLETELY JUST THROUGH BEHAVIORS AND I THINK THAT'S QUITE INTERESTING AND QUITE POWERFUL NOW I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS A WAY THAT ANY ONE CAN INCREASE THEIR LEVELS OF GROWTH HORMON DRAMATICALLY AND WHEN I SAY DRAMATICALLY I MEAN DRAMATICALLY I'LL GET TO THE NUMBERS IN A COUPLE MINUTES BUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER HOW GROWTH HORMON IS RELEASED IN THE FIRST PLACE REMEMBER IT ALL STARTS IN THE BRAIN IN THE HYPOTHALMAS THE HYPOTHALMAS IS A BRAINAREA THAT CONTROLS THINGS LIKE SEXTUAL BEHAVIOR TEMPERATURE REGULATION CIRCDIAN BEHAVIOR MEANING WHEN YOU WANT TO BE AWAKEN WHEN YOU WANT TO BE ASLEEP AGGRESSION ALL OF THAT THERE ARE OTHER BRAINARYAS INVOLVE TOO BUT IT HAS A RICH COLLECTION OF DIFFERENT NIRONS INVOLVED IN ALL THESE VERY BASIC FUNCTIONS NOW S WE TALKED ABOUT THE RELEASING HORMONS THE GROWTH HORMON RELEASING HORMON COMES FROM NIRONS IN THE HYPOTHALMAS THOSE THEN COMMUNICATE WITH THE POTUITARY IN THE POTUITARY RELEASES GROWTH HORMON AND THEN THE GROTH HORMON ACTS ON ALL THES DIFFERENT TISSUES MOSCLE LIVER CARTILAGE ET CETERA BODY FAT MAKES TH USE ENERGY SWHILE YOU LOSE BODY FAT WHEN GROWTH HORMON LEVELS ARE HIGH MAKES YOU GROW MUSCLE STRENGTHENS BONES ET CETERA NOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS A PROFOUND EFFECT ON GROWTH HORMON LEVELS GROWTHHORMON RELEASE IS TEMPERATURE NOW THE DATE ON THIS ARE VERY STRONG AND THE DATA COME FROM BOTH ANIMAL STUDIES AND HUMAN STUDIES SO THERE ARE NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT HAVE EXPLORED HOW MAKING ANIMALS COLD OR HOT CAN INCREASE GROWTH HORMON AND IF YOU'RE GRESSING WHICH DIRECTION THIS ISCAN TO GO YOU CAN PROBABLY IMAGINE THAT MAKING ANIMALS OR PEOPLE WARMER IS THE WAY TO GO IF YOU WANT TO INCREASE GROWTH HORMON NOW ANY TIME YOU 'ARE GOING TO INCREASE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SELF OR ANY ONE ELSE OR AN ANIMAL IT IS RISKY I WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT THIS NOT EVERYONE SHOULD ENGAGE IN THE BEHAVIORS I 'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE BUT THAND I SHOULD JUST SAY THE REASON AT SZ RISKY IS IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH OF A TEMPERATURE INCREASE IN THE BRAIN TO COOK THE BRAIN TO COOK NERANS AND AFTER THAT POINT NURANS CAN'T COME BACK AND PEOPLE CAN DIE FROM HYPER THERMIA WE HAVE A MUCH GREATER RANGE IN TERMS OF COLD YOU CAN ALSO DIE OF HYPOTHERMIA YOU CAN FREASE TO DEATH BUT YOU HAVE A MUCH GREATER RANGE OF GETTING COLD THAN YOU DO WARMING UP THE BRAIN HOWEVER THERE REALLY STRONG DATA POINTING TO THE FACT THAT SANA A CA DELIBERATE HYPEROTHERMIA NOT TOO HIGH HOWEVER THAT SANA CAN INCREASE THE RELESE OF GROWTH HORMON AND OTHER HORMONS AND WHAT SO DRAMATIC ABOUT THIS LITRATURE IS THE SIZE OF THE EFFECTS THAT ARE REPORTED SO FIRST WHALT LET'S TALK ABOUT THESE TEMPERATURE INCREASES AND YES I WILL REFER TO THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO EVEN IF YOU DON'T OWN ASANA BECAUSE I REALIZE NOT EVERYBODY HAS A SAN IN THEIR BACK YARD OR HAS AXCESS TO ASSANA SO FIRST OF ALL RECALL OUR STUDY ABOUT EXERCISE WHERE WARMING UP A FEW DEGREES BEFORE THE EXERCISE LED TO BIGGER AND QUICKER INCREASES IN GROWTH HORMON DURING THE EXERCISE BOUT ITSELF SO THAT ALREADY POINT IN THE DIRECTION THAT TEMPERATURE WAS IMPORTANT NOW THAT THE DEGREES NOPON INTENDED THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INCREASING BODY TEMPERATURE IS BY ENTERING SANAS THAT ARE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX DEGREES FARENHEIT SO THAT ITS EIGHTY DEGREES SELSIUS AM AND ALL THE WAY UP TO LIKE TWO HUNDRED AND TEN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN DEGREES FERENHEIT I PERSONALLY KNOW PEOPLE THAT GO EVEN HIGHER THAN THAT BUT THEY'VE TRAIND THEMSELVES TO DEAL WITH WITH VERY HIGH HEATS AND GAIN HIGHHE IS DANGEROUS YOU MUST CLEAR THIS WITH YOUR DOCTOR NOW WHAT HAPPENS IN HIGH HEAT COUPLE THINGS HAPPEN IN HIT FIRST OF ALL YOU START GETTING BIGGER STROKE VOLUME OF THE HEART CONLIKE AN EXERCISE ONCE YOU GET WELL TRAINED IN ENDURANCE ACTIVITY OR STROKE VOLUME THE AMOUNT OF BLOOD THAT YOUR HARKENPOMP EACH TIME GETS LARGER YOU DILATE THE BLOOD VESSELS RIGHT THERE ARE LOT OF THINGS T HAPPEN ALSO YOUR SWEATING YOUR BODIES TRIME A UNLOAD HEAT DILATION OF BLOOD VESSELS ARGENINE INCREASES IN HEAT WERE STARTING TO SEE AND HERE A COMMON THEME BUT IT APPEARS THAT GETTING INTO A NOTHING GETTING THE BODY UP TO TWO UNDRED TWELVE DEGREES FARENHEIHT ONE BE VERY CLEAR NOT TALKING ABOUT GETTING THE BODY UP TO HUNDRED DEGREES SELSIUS THAT WOULD BE TERRIBLE M YOU WOULD DIE BUT ENTERING ENVIRONMENTS WHERE IT'S VERY HOT FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY MINUTES TO THIRTY MINUTES WHERE THE TEMPERATURE IS EIGHTY DEGREES SELSIUS TO A HUNDRED DEGREES SELSIUS OR A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DEGREES FARAN HEIGHT MORE LESS TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TEN DEGREES FAIR AN HEIGHT MORE OR LESS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE GROWTH HORMON RELEASE SIXTEEN FOLD THAT'S RIGHT SIXTEENFOLD THAT'S ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED PER CENT NOW THEREARE ALSO EFFECTS ON OTHER HORMONES PROLACTIN QUARTIS ALL ET CETERA SO THE PATTERN THAT WAS DESCRIBED IN THIS STUDY THERE BE MANY STUDIES NOW UM ENDERGRAN EFFECTS OF REPEDA SANA UM WE'RE WE'RE DONE IN SEVENTEEN HUMANS UM THIS WAS FROM DOING THIS REPEATEDLY SO IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME THEY DID THIS THEY HAD TO SHE HAD TO DO THIS THREE DAYS IN A ROW AND THE PATTERN WAS TO GET INTO THE SANA FOR TWENTY MINUTES FOLLOWED BY A THIRTY MINUTE COOLING PERIOD REMEMBER YOU DON'T WANT TO SPEND LONG PERIEDS OF TIME AT HIGH HEAT YOU CAN COOK YOUR BRAIN AND OTHER TISSUES UM BE VERY CAREFUL AS YOU APPROACH THIS IF YOU DECIDE TO BUT THIRTY MINUTES A EXCUSE ME TWENTY MINUTESAN FOLLOWED BY THIRTY MINUTES OF COOLING FOLLOW BY TWENTY MINUTESONA AGAIN LED TO A FIGHFOLD INCREASIN GROWTH HORMON AND THEN BY DOING THAT DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY ON THE THIRD DAY YOU WOULD SEE THESE HUGE INCREASES OF LIKE SIXTEENFOLD UP TO SIXTEENFOLD AND THERE ARE NOW MANY STUDIES LIKE THIS THIS WAS DESCRIBED UM A FEW YEARS AGO UM BUT SINCE THEN THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF OTHER STUDIES THAT AVE POINTED IN THE DIRECTION OF DELIBERATE HYPERTHORMIA BUT NOT TOO HOT THAT YOU KILL YOURSELF IN ORDER TO INCREASE GROWTH HORMO AND I KNOW I KEEP HIGH LIGHTING THE DANGERS THERE BUT AGAIN ANY TIME YOU ARE GOING TO MESS WITH HEAT YOU HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL SO STANDARD SANA CAN UM CAN BE USEFUL IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ASSANA ONE WAY THAT PEOPLE DO THIS WE HAVE TO LOOK TO OUR FRIENDS THE WRESTLERS RIGHT THEY WEAR PLASTICS WHICH ARE BASICALLY BODY SUITS THAT ARE FAIRLY INEXPENSIVE THAT YOU CAN BUY ON UM A ANY ON LINE PURCHASE PLATFORM I SHOULD SAY UM SOME PEOPLE IN THE OLD DAYS BEFORE A THEY HAD THESE PLASTICS THINGS SO READILY AVAILABLE A IACTION TO PEOPLE THAT WRAP THEMSELVES IN GARBAGE BAGS AND THEN THRAW ON SWEATS IN A HOODY AND THEN GO OUT FOR A JOG AGAIN YOU OUHT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL SPECIALY ON A HOT DAY OVERHEATING CAND ACQUAITE TO DEATH BUT THAT'S ANOTHER WAY TO HEAT UP YOU DON'T ACTUALLY NEED A SANA I'VE KNOWN PEOPLE WHO WILL DO THIS IN HOTELROOMS WHILE THEIR TRAVELING THEY'LL TURN ON THE HEAT THET YOU'LL MAKE A HOT BATH THEY WON'T ACTUALLY GET IN THE BATH BUT THEY'LL FILL THE ROOM WITH STEAM AND HEAT AND THEY'LL PUT ON A HOODIE AND SOME SWEATSHIRE A  SWEAT PANTS AND THEY'LL SIT THERE WITH WITH WOL SACSON AND THEY'LL GET WARM FOR TWENTY MINUTES THAN THEYLL TAKE A COOL SHOWER AND THEN THEY'LL DO IT AGAIN I GUESS WHEN THE HOTELS PLAYING THE WATER BILL YOU DON'T YOUN'T WORRY ABOUT IT TOO MUCH SOME PEOPLE CORSE OWN SANAS THEIR LATAWAYS THROUGH THAT OF FRIENDS WHOAR IN THE MILITARY WHO MADE SANAS OUT OF CARS WHILE THEY WERE OVERSEES ALL SORTS OF THINGS YOU DO HAVE TO BE CAREFUL I KNOWE SAID IT MANY MANY TIMES THAT JUSTON ON ANY WHONE TO HURT THEMSELVES BUT THESE INCREASES IN GROWTH HORMON ARE TREMENDOUS AND WHAT THEY PROBABLY STEM FROM OR INCREASED ACTIVITY OF NURONS WITHIN THE HYPOTHALEMUS THAT STIMULATE GROWTH HORMONE RELEASE FROM THE PETUITARY AND THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE THE GROWTH HORMON RELEASING HORMONE NURONS IN THE HYPOTHALMUS SIT VERY CLOSELY AND MAY EVEN BE INTERMIXED WITH SOME OF THE NURONS IN THE HYPOTHALMUS THAT REGULATE HEAT AND BODY TEMPERATURE REMEMBER METABOLISM IS IN PART A HEAT IT'S LIKE A FURNACE OF HOW MUCH ENERGY YOU ARE CONSUMING AND USING FOR BUILDING OR FOR ON ENERGY USAGE PURPOSES SO SANA CAN BE VERY VERY INTERESTING AND AGAIN ITS TWENTY MINUTES THIRTY MINUTE COOLING TWENTY MINUTES AGAIN ON PROCEED WITH EXTREME CAUTION BUT NONE THE LESS THESE ARE PRETTY EXTREME EFFECTS IN TERMS OF THEIR A BILITIES TO INCREASE GROWTH HORMON LEVELS ALONG THE LINES OF TEMPERATURE IN HORMONES I JUST WANT TO MENTION A VERY RECENT STUDY JUST CAME OUT MARCH APRIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE ENDERGRAN EFFECTS OF REPEATED HOT THERMAL STRESS AND COLD WATER IMMERSION IN YOUNG ADULT MEN UNFORTUNAE WAS JUST IN MEN THEY DIDN'T LOOK AT WOMEN BUT NONE THE LESS I THINK THE DATE ARE RELEVANT TO TO EVERYBODY AS A GENERAL THEME THIS IS POD STASKI AT ALL I WILL PUT A LINK TO THE STUDY IN THE CAPTION AND THEY LOOKED AT TESTASTRON PROLACED IN CORTISALL ET CETERA AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT THE SANA DOES INDEED LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CORTISALL A STRESS HORMON A HORMON THAT YOU WANT TO BE RELEASED EARLY IN THE DAY WHEN YOU WAKE UP BUT SANA DEFINITELY LED TO A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CORTISALL BUT DID NOT CHANGE TESTASTRON DIATIER OR PROLACTIN LEVELS SO THAT'S INTERESTING AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THE COLD DID EFFECT SOME OF THESE HORMONES BUT THE RESULTS THERE WERE A LITTLE BIT MORE MIXED SO THE TAKE AWAY HERE IS THAT HEAT SEEMS TO HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON GROWTH HORMON BIG EFFECTS IT SEEMS TO HAVE POSTIVE EFFECTS ON REDUCING CORTISALL LEVELS AND IT DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE EFFECTS ON THINGS LIKE TESTASTERON DITIE OR PROLACTIN DIRECTLY YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT A SHIFT IN ANY HORMONAS GAN ALTER THEI LEVELS OF OTHER HORMONES DAWN THE LINES OR INDIRECT EFFECTS BUT IN TERMS DIRECT EFFECTS ON JUST JURING OR IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SONABATH THERE W THERE WERE NO EFFECTS SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT DIET SUPPLEMENTA TION BEHAVIORAL TOOLS AND OF COURSE WE TALKED ABOUT THE UNDERLYING BIOLOGY AND LOGIC AND HOFLY YOU HEARD THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS FOR ALL OF THOSE NOW I'D LIKE TO JUST BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT THE PRESCRIPTIONCIDE OF ALL THIS THERE ARE AS WE KNOW MANY PEOPLE TAKING GROWTH HORMON BECAUSE IT'S BEEN PRESCRIBED TO THEM BY A DOCTOR PRESUMABLY THERE R PEOPLE TON GROWTH HORMON EVEN THOUGH IT HAS NOT BEEN PRESCRIBED BY A DOCTOR WHICH IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS BUT THE POINT HERE IS THAT MOST ALL OF THE HORMONS THAT WE MAKE HAVE BEEN SYNTHESIZED SO THERE ARE VERSIONS OF THEM IN LITTLE BOTTLES OR LITTLE AMPULS THAT PEOPLE CAN INJECT YOURE COUPLE IMPORTANT THINGS TO CONSIDER IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO THAT ROUT FIRST OF ALL TALK TO A PHYSICIAN RIGHT THEY ACTUALLY ARE ONLY LEGALLY AVAILABLE THROUGH A PHYSICIAN SECOND OF ALL ANY TIME YOU'RE INJECTING SOMETHING YOU'RE GOING TO SHUT DOWN YOUR OWN PRODUCTION THAT'S THE WAY THAT THE HORMON SYSTEM WORKS IF YOU TAKE THIRE AT HORMON YOU WON'T MAKE THIROID HORMN AT LEAST IN THE LONG RUN IF YOU TAKE TESTASTRON YOU WILL SHUT DOWN YOUR OWN PRODUCTION OF TESTOSTRON YOU TAKE ESTEROGEN THE SYSTEMS LILE MORE RAZILIENT BUT EVENTUALLY YOU WILL SHUT DOWN YOUR PRODUCTION OF ASTROGEN AND THE SAME IS TRUE FOR GROWTH HORMON SO A DECISION TO GO THAT ROUTE OF TAKING SOMETHING IS OFTEN NOT ALWAYS A DECISION TO DO IT FOREVER HOWEVER IF YOU'RE WILLING TO SUSTAIN A PERIOD OF BEING WITHOUT A GIVEN HORMON SOME PEOPLE CAN DO THINGS AND THEN TAKE A A STOP TAKING THEM AND THEN WAIDE OUT THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY'RE NOT MAKING TESTOSTRON ESTEROGEN OR GROWTH HORMON AND THEN IT WILL COME BACK SOMETIMES AND SOMETIMES IT WONT THERE'S A KIND OF NEW AREA THAT'S DEVELOPING NOW THAT I THINK DESERVES ARE ATTENTION NOT BECAUSE I'M ENCOURAGING IT BUT BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING AND IN KEEPING WITH THE SCIENCE AND IN KEEPING WITH A TRYING TO KEEP THINGS MODERN A IT'S WORTH US DISCUSSING AND THOSE ARE PEPTIDES SO THESE DAYS YOU HEARE A LOT ABOUT PEPTIDES LIKE TO CLARIFY LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT PEPTIDES ARE PEPTIDES IS A REALLY HUGE CATEGORY OF BIOLOGICAL COMPOUNDS PEPTIDES ARE JUST STRINGS OF A MINO ACIDS RIGHTS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ALTIRICINE ARGENINE ORNATHING THOSE ARE AMINO ACIDS WHICH ARE INDIVIDUAL MINO ACIDS AND THOSE ARE PUT TOGETHER INTO LITTLE SMALL PEPTIDES OR THE'RE WHAT TOE CALLED POLLY PEPTIDES WHICH ARE JUST LONGER PEPTIDES TURNS OUT THAT FOR ANY SUBSTANCE LIKE GROTHHORMON OR GROWTH HORMN RELEASING HORMON IT'S MADE UP OF DIFFERENT AMINO ACIDS AND DIFFERENT SEQUENCES JUST LIKE YOUR GENES ARE MADE UP OF AGED ASANGESAN CESANTEES NUCLEOTIDES AND DIFFERENT SEQUENCES IT'S LIKE A RECIPE PEPTIDES TEND TO BE SHORT SEQUENCES OF AMINO ACIDS THAT RESEMBLE A HORMON ENOUGH OR RESEMBLE SOME OTHER PEPTIDE ENOUGH THAT IT CAN LEAD TO THE SIMILAR SAME EFFECTS WHEN YOU INJECT THEM SO FOR EXAMPLE WE MAKE GROWTH HORMO N RELEASING HORMON FROM OUR BRAIN WHICH STIMULATES GROWTHORMON FROM THE POTO ITARR YOUR PROBABLY GETTING TIRED OF M HERE AS SAYING THAT BY NOW BUT PEOPLE NOW WILL TAKE THINGS LIKE SERMORILIN S E R M O R E L I N SIRMORILIN WHICH IS NOT THE ENTIRE PEPTIDE SEQUENTS OF GROWTH HORMON RELEASING HORMON BUT IT'S A SUBSET OF THOSE AND WHEN PEOPLE INJECT IT BEFORE THEY GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT IS TYPICALLY HOW IT'S DONE ON AN EMPTY STOMACH THEN THAT STIMULATES THE RELEASE OF GROWTHORMON FROM THE PARTUITORY SO THIS IS NOT TAKING GROWTH HORMON THIS IS TAKING THE STIMULATING HORMON OR WHAT'S OFTEN CALLED A SECRETAGOG OR A MIMIC ARIGHTIC CAUSES A A SECRETION OF THE HORMON THAT ONE WANTS PEOPLE DO THIS FOR THIROID HORMON TO SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING THIS BY PRESCRIPTION WITH A REAL MEDICAL NEED OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING IT FOR JUST LONGEVITY REASONS WHICH CAL CAN NOT FALLS INTO THAT GRAY ZON OF THEY WOULDN'T DIE WITHOUT IT BUT THEY ONT ENHANCE THEIR LIFE AND SO THEYARE DOING THAT BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IT'S THE RIGHT THING FOR THEM PRESCRIPTION SIRMORILIN IS PRESCRIPTION DO THEY WORK YES DO THEY SHUT DOWN YOUR NATURAL PRODUCTION OF GROWTH HORMON RELEASING HORMON WILL THERE THE ANSWER IS YES BUT SOME OF THESE PEPTIDES ACTUALLY HAVE THE EFFECT OF CHANGING GENE EXPRESSION REMEMBER WAY BACK TO THE BEGINNING WHEN A TUG AMOUT HORMONS THEY CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE GENE EXPRESSION AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY SET PATHWAYS IN MOTION FOR CONTINUED PRODUCTION OF A HORMON EVEN IF YOU STOP TAKING THE COMPOUND NOW THAT CAN BE GOOD OR THAT CAN BE BAD BECAUSE AS YOU RECALL GROWTHORMON IN BIG A BIG INCREASES IN GROWTHORMON THAT ARE SHORT LIVED LIKE SANA OR I YOU NOW I SHOULD SAY EXERCISE OR ARGENINE OR SANA IT SSIONS LIKE HAS THIS HUGE EFFECTS OM OR EARLY NIGHTS YOU KNOW FIRST PHASES OF SLEEP EARLY IN THE NIGHT THESE SORTS OF THINGS THOSE ARE TRANSIENT BUT WHEN ONE IS INJECTING OVER AND OVER A CONSTANT LEVEL YOU CAN PUT INTO ACTION GENE EXPRESSION PROGRAMES THAT CAN BE LONG LIVED AND LET SAY YOU HAVE OF PARTICULAR TUMOR IN THE BODY TUMERS WILL GROW WHEN THEY SEE GROWTHORMON EVEN IF THAT TUMOR IS UNHEALTHY FOR YOU RIGHT YOU'VE GOT GROWTH OF TISSUES ALL OVER THE BODY SO AGAIN I'M NOT SAYING WHETHER NOT PEOPLE SHOULD DO THESE THINGS ARE NOT DOING THEM ONE THING I DO KNOW IS THAT THEY ARE IN VERY PROMINENT USE O IN THE MOVIANDUSTRY PEOPLE WHO WANT A PEEL OFF BODY FACT QUICKLY THEY DO INCREASE RECOVERY TIME THE INCREASE HEALING RATES PEOPLE ARE ALSO INJECTING THINGS LIKE GASTRIC PEPTIDES THEIRE ACTUALLY STOMACH PEPTIDES THAT WE TALKD ABOUT INTHE REVIOUS EPISODE THINGS RELATED TO THE GRELLIN PATHWAY AND OTHER THINGS FROM THE LIVER THAT CAN IMPROVE THE RATE OF TISSUE AND WOUND HEALING YOU CAN BET THAT IN THE UPCOMING OLYMPICS LOT OF PEOPLE ARE USING PEPTIDES AND COMPOUNDS AND I'M NOT POINTING FINGERS THAT ANY ONE IN PARTICULAR JUST THIS IS SEPARATE FROM HORMON AUGMENTATION OF LIKE INJECTING G TURE INJECTING TESTASTERON PEOPLE ARE NOW WORKING FURTHER UP THE PATHWAYS OTHER NAMES OF SOME OF THE PEPTIDES OR THINGS LIKE IPERMORILIN OM TESAMORILIN SOME OF THESE HAVE CL NICAL USES OTHERS HAVE JUST BEEN MADE AS COMPOUNDS FOR PEOPLE IN THE KIND OF A LONGEVITY FIELD OR THE A SELF AUGMENTATION FIELD IF YOU WILL SO AGAIN NOT PROMOTING THEIR USE BUT THEIRE DEFINLY OUT THERE AND SO NOW IF YOU HEREABOUT THEM OR SOME ONE'S TALKING ABOUT THEM NOW HOPEFUL Y HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THEIR UNDERLYING BIOLOGY AND YOU CAN THINK RATIONALLY ABOUT WHETHER NOT THEY ARE THE RIGHT DECISION FOR YOU OQE ONCE AGAIN COVERED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MATERIAL HOPEFULLY NOW YOU UNDERSTAND FHIEROID HORMONE AND WHAT IT DOES AND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ITS MECHANISM OR MAY BE A LOT AND GROWTH HORMONE AND WHAT IT DOES AND HOW BOTH OF THEM TAKE CARE OF OUR METABOLISM IF THEY DICTATE HOW MANY NUTRIANS WE CAN EAT AND MAKE USE OF THEY CAN PULL FROM BODY FAT STORES REPARMUSCLE REPAR CARTILAGE THEY REALLY ARE INCREDIBLE COMPOUNDS AND THEY ARE ACTIONABLE THEYRE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO LIKE GETTING THAT EARLY PHASE OF SLEEP PERHAPS SUPPLEMENTING WITH ARGENY MAY BE NOT HOPEFULLY GETTING ADEQUATE EXERCISE WARMING UP PROPERLY NOT MAKING THE EXERCISE TOO LONG OR TO INTENS WILL HELP MAY BE SANA OR THINGS LIKE IT YOUR DELIBERATE SAFE HYPERTHERMIA THE EMPHASIS UNSAFE MIGHT BE THINGS THAT ARE OF USE REGARDLESS EVEN IF YOUARE NOT INTERESTED IN THE FHIEROID OR THE GROWTH HORMONE PATHWAYS THIS BRINGS TO A CLOSHE OUR MONTH ON HORMONES AND SO NOW HOPEFULLY YOU UNDERSTAND NOT JUST FHIEROID AND GROWTH HORMON BUT THE LOGIC THAT UNDERLIES THIROTORMON GROWTH HORMON ESTROGEN TESTOSTERONE WHY WE EAT WHY WE STOP EATING COLISSIS A KINING GREELAN IF THESE NAMES DON'T MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU THEN PERHAPS GO BACK AND LISTEN TO THOSE EPISODES BUT REGARDLESS I HOPE THAT YOU COME AWAY FROM THIS WITH A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THESE HORMONES WHICH ARE SO POWERFUL IN CONTROLLING THE WAY OUR BRAIN FUNCTIONS AND THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE BRAIN AND HORMONES BECAUSE IT IS REALLY A BY DIRECTIONAL CONVERSATION THE BRAIN IS TELLING THE BODY WHAT HORMONES TO MAKE THE HORMONES ARE INFLUENCING ALL THE TISSUES OF THE BODY BUT ALSO TELLING THE BRAIN WHETHER NOT TO EAT MORE GROWMORE THINK MORE ET CETERA SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION IF YOU LIKE THIS PODCAST AND YOU'RE FINDING IT USEFUL PLEASE RECOMMEND IT TO OTHER PEOPLE IF YOU ARE ON YOU TO PLEASE SUBSCRIBE

ALASKA HE PAID TRIBUTE TO JOHN MACCAN WHICH AGAIN I MEAN THAT THAT'S NICE BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH NINE ELEVEN PERSA AND THEN HE TRIED TO DO TH BY PARTISONSHIP ROTINE WHICH IS KIND OF AMAZING CONSIDERING THT HE'S CALLED HALF OF AMERICANS THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO WISH TO OVERTHROW THE DEMOCRACY BUT SURE HERE AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES YESTERDAY ON AN A DAY OF NATIONAL UNITY

BECAUSE HE HAD CHILDHOOD OUSE MASO I' JUST TA A QUICK CONTRAST THERE BETWEEN JOHN MCCANE WHO JOBIDON RAN AGAINST REMEMBER JOBIDON WAS THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR BAROKOBAMA IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT I NOWIT'S NOW DECADE AN A HALF AGO BUT THAT'S A THING THAT ACTUALLY HAPPEN AND DURING THAT CAMPAIN JOBINE WAS NOT SUPERNIZED TO JOHN MC CANBUT PUT ASIDE ALL OF THE MCCAN THE THE REAL THING HERE THAT THAT CANNA STICKS IN THE CRAW IS JOBIDON TALKING ABOUT NATIONAL UNITY BECAUSE HE IS NOT EVEN REMOTELY UNIFIER HE'S NOT SOME NEW CARES ABOUT UNITY HES SOME WHO PRETENDS TO CARE ABOUT UNITY BUT THE REALITY IS THAT HE HIS PURSUED THE FURTHEST LEFT TO GENDA OF ANY PRESIDENT OF MY LIFE TIME ANDTHAT ACTUALLY INCLUDES BAROKOBAMA THE STUFF THAT HE HIS ATTEMPTED TO DO IN RESTRUCTURING FOR EXAMPLE STUDENT LONES UNALATERALLY FROM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH THE STUFF THAT HE IS ATTEMPTED TO DO IN CRAMMING DOWN VAXINES ON EIGHTY MILLION PEOPLE THE OSHA THE INSANE LEVELS OF SPENDING HE HAS PURSUED POST

HOLD HIM ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER THE MEHT IF HELD HIM ACCOUNTSABLE WHEN THERE ARE OTHER DEMOCRATS WHO IS RUNNING AGAINST BUT NOW HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE RULE IS

EVER SINCE 'SIDTHING THE SORTIS OF CANDAMAGE JOBIDON I KNOW THAT HE THINKS HE'S INVULNERABLE BECAUSE HE'S LIKELY TO RUN AGAINSTONAL TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT AND THERE'S SOME TRUTH TO THAT THAT MEANS A DURABLE FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WILL CERTAINLY VOTE FOR HIM BUT FORTY FIVE AINHT FIFTY SEES PLAYING A VERY RISKY GAME HERE BY THE WAY SPEAKING OF A WHITE HOUSE THAT CLEARLY DOES NOT CARE ABOUT AMERICAN DEFENSE ACCORDING TO POLITICO PRESIDENT JO BIDON WOULD VETO A RIGHTLING TO FENCE FUNDING BIL TAT'S SLATED TO BE CONSIDERED ON THE HOUSE FLOOR THIS WEEK ACCORDING TO HIS ADMINISTRATION WHAT MAKES IT RIGHT WING WHAT MAKES A RIGHT WING THAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING WE DON'T WANT TAX PAIR DOLLARS USED TO FUN PEOPLES TRAVEL TO OTHER STATES TO GET ABORTIONS CAS LAST I CHACT WHEN I PAY FOR MILITARY BUGET TYPICALLY WHEN I'M PAYING FORT IS LIKE THE BASIC MEDICAL CARE OF THE PEOPLE OR SERVING THE AMERICAN MILITARY SO THEY CAN GO AN BREAK THINGS IN KILL PEOPLE THAT

ABORTION HERE AND THE FACT THAT DEMOCRATS WANT TO FUNDIT WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT ABORTION CONTINUES TO RAGE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES BY SOME NUMBERS IS ACTUALLY ELEVATED THIS YEAR BECAUS THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE HORE FREE TO OUT ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO ABORT THEIR BABY THAT THEY'RE TRYING TACTIC DO IT RIGHT NOW BUT THERE IS A WAY THAT YOU CAN HELP PREVENT THIS AND THAT WOULD BE BY GIVING TO PREBORN PREBORNS NETWORK OF CLINNICS EXPERIENCES OVER TWO HUNDRED MIRACLES PER DAY PREBORN GIVES WOMEN ITH UN PLAN PREGNANCIES FREE ALLS FOR SOUNDS INTRODUCING THEM TO THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE

HE'S INTENSELY VULNERABLE HERE'S THE THING THAT THAT IF YOU WERE TRULY A REBEL AS FOR EXAMPLE ALEXANDER O COSEQUETAS BELIEVES SHE IS IF YOU'RE TRULY A REBEL THEN YOU WOULD RUN AT YOBIDE FROM HIS LEFT YOU WOULD CAY KNOW ALEXANDRA OCOSOCRETAS SHE'S THIRTY THREE YEARS OLD I BELIEVE THAT SHE WOULD BE THEO RATICALLY ELLO ABLE FOR THE PRECIDENCY THE TRUTH IS THAT SHE COULD EASILY PICK UP THE BALL WHERE BURNINY SANDERS LEFT OFF AND RUN AGAINST JOBDEN FROM HIS LEFT BECAUSE HE'S REALLY REALLY VULNERAL BUT NONE OF THEM ARE DOING IT WHY BEAUSE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS IN FACT A VEHICLE FOR RADICAL LEFTISM THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT IN TROMS THEIR PARTIES REWINGERS DON'T TRUST THE RE PUBLICAN PARTY BEAUSE THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT'S VEHICLE FOR THEIR IDEAS DEMOCRATS TRUST THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BECAUSE THEY DO BELIEVE THAT IS A VEHICLE FOR THE PRINCIPLES THAT'S WHY THER ALL STANDING SHOULDERS SHOULDER BEHIND THE OLD MAN MEANWHILE THAT OLD MAN IS USING THE WHITE HOUSE AS HA

CALL EIGHT THREE THREE MYDOG THIRTY THREE THAT'S EIGHT THREY THREE MY DOG THIRTY THREE O GA MEANWHILE THE BINE ADMINISTRATION FOR FRAUDTOG ABOUT THE DOING ON THE FOREIGN FRONT ON THE DOMESTIC FRONT WHAT THE BINE DEMNISTRATION HAS DONE WITH REGARD TO SOCIAL MEDIA IS ONE OF THE MOST CREEPY AND TYRANNICAL THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN IN MY LIFETIME AN EXTENDS THE TRUTH IS BEFOREBIDON I DI THE GOVERNMENTS USE OF ITS POWERS TO CUDGEL SOCIAL MEDIA INTO DOING WHAT THEY WANT IS UTTERLY INSANG THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE FIFTH COURT C EXPLICATED OVER THE WEAK END ON FRIDAY THEY LIMITED THE SCOPE OF DISTRICT CORT RULING THER RE STRICTED COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN GOVERMENT AGENCIES AND SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES BUT THEY FOUND THAT SEVERAL AGENCIES LIKELY VIOLATED THE FIRST AMENDMENT THIS SHOULD BE LIKE TOP OF PAGE NEWS AND IN EN ERO WHERE THE MEDIA ACTUALLY CARED ABOUT FREEDOM OF SPEECH WHICH THEY CLEADARLY DO NOT AT THIS POINT OF WOULD BE TOP OF THE PAGE NEWS AND WHENT WHEN WHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS SAYING THINGS LIKE THE PRESON THE ENEMY THE BALA ANEMALL WE GO WAS THIS AN ATTACK ON THE FIRST AMENDMENTITS UNAMERICAN HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT THE'RE NOT ENEMIES OF THE MEANWHILE YOU HAVE ACTUAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES GOING TO SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES AND TELLING THEM TO SHUT DOWN FULLY CERTAIN STREMES OF INFORMATION ANDTHE METIS LIKE BECAUSE IF THE MAINSTREMEDIA AGREES WITH A THING IT BECOMES TRUTH IF THE MAINSTREMEDIA DISAGREES WITH A THING IT BECOMES FALSEHOOD AND IT WOULD BE GOOD IF THAT THING WERE SUPPRISSED WELL HERE'S THE THING  MAKINGTHE ARGUMENT THE SOCIAL MEDIA IS A PRIVATE ENTITY AND CAN MAKE ITS ONE RULES THAT CARRIES ONLY SO FAR AS THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT PRESSURING THE PRIVATE ENTITY INTO DOING THE THING ONE TOORY GOVERNMENT AGENT YOU CAN'T DO THAT THING IF THE GOVRMENT PUTS GUNS YOUR HEAD AND TELS YOU TO DO A THING YOU ARE NOW A GOVERNMENT AGENT THAT MEANS THAT WHATEVER YOU DO IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT GHOSE TO SOCIAL MEDIA AND THEY SAY TO THEM EITHER YOU REGULATE TO SPEECH OR WE REGULATE YOU WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY WITH DEMOCRATSMEN SAYING SINCEABOUT TWENTY EIGHTEEN IF THEY SAY THAT SORT OF THING THIS TURN SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES INTO OPERATIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT ONCE THEIR OPERATIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT THEN THE PRESSURE THAT GOVERNMENT BRINGS TO BEAR IS IN FACTIVIOLATION THE FIRTHE FIRST AMENDMENT WHICH IS EXACTLY WHIT THE FIFTH  CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEAL SAYS ACCORDING TO S UN B S THE RULING WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR SEVERAL FEDERAL AGENCIES TO COMMUNICATE WITH SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES STILL OFFICIALS WHO REMAIN SUBJECT TO THE MODIFIED INJUNCTION INCLUDING GOES IN HE WHITE HOUSE MUST REMAN CAREFUL THEIR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PLATFORMS WILL NOT BE CONSTRUE AS COERCIVE A THREE JUDGE PANEL OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS CONCLUDED THAT THE WHITE HOUSE SURGEON GENERAL'S OFFICE AND F BEY LIKELY VIOLATED THE FIRST AMENDMENT BY COERCING SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS INTO MODERATING POSTS ON THEIR SIGTS IT ALSO SAID THAT THE SED C LIKELY VIOLATED THE FIRST AMENDMENT THE APPEALS COURT DECISION SAYS THAT SOME FEDERAL AGENCIES WON'T BE SUBJECT TO THE INJUNCTION BUT THEY DID SAY AND IT'STHAT IT'S A PRETTY AMAZING RULING THEY DID SAY THAT THE PRESSURE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS A VIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENTWHICH IT CLEARLY IS AND THAT PRESSURE IS OBVIOUSLY CONTINUING HERE'S THE THING ONCE THAT YU NEAS OUT A BATTLE THE CAMPY UNDONE SO LET'S SAY THAT THE CEDYCY IS NOT PRESSURING ANY MORE BUT THE MESSAGES ARETY OUT THARE THE PESSURE EXISTS THE THREAT IS ALREADY OUT THERE IF ALCOPONE THREATEN TO BURN DOWN YOUR BAR BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T PAY THE PROTECTION MONEY AND HE DID THAT A YEAR AGO IF PROBLY SOOK IN TO PAY HIM THE PROTECTION MONEY EVEN AFTER A COURT SAYS HEU REALLY SHOULDN'T

STUFFHERE AND AND THE FACT THAT THAT IS NOT A NATIONAL SCANDAL TDEMONSTRATES MORE HAN ANYTHING HOW KORUPT THE MEDIAR THESE AGAIN THE MEDIA YOUOUD IMAGINE WOULD BE PROFIRST AMENMENT WELL NOT SO MUCH OK SO YOU' IMAGINE THAT ALL THIS WOULD BE WIND IN THE SALES FOR REPUBLICAN'S GOING INTO TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AFTER ALL THIS IS TERRIBLE GOVERNMENTS THIS IS TERRANNICAL USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA THE AMERICAN POPLE ARE NOT UP FOR ALL THIS SO ALL REPUBLICANS HAVE TO DO IS BE NOT STUPID WELL OOPS SO REPUBLICANS ALWAYS HAVE A WAY OF A OF DOING DUMB THINGS ALL THE TALK RIGHT NOW ABOUT HOW KEVERMC CARTHY IS GOING TO BE BASICALLY DEPRIVED OF HIS SPEAKERSHIP I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT IS THE UPSIDE I KEP ASKNESS A'VEBEN ASKING THE SINCE THERE IS THE ORIGINAL REBELLION AGAINST MC CARTHY IT'S ONE THING TO LEVERAGE MC CARTHY FOR MORE CONSESSIONS THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE OF THE OW THAT'S FINE THAT'S A STRATEGY THE HAFT PEOPLE LAND THE PLAN YOU KNOW IT IS NOT A STRATEGY WHAT IF WE GET RID OF MC CARTHY AND THEN WE HAVE NO ONE TO BACK HIM UP WHAT F WE YUS HAVE A RANDUM SPEAKERSHIP FIGHT SO PEOPLE CAN GET ONTEVY THIS SORT OF STUFF IS DEEPLY UN HELPFUL ACCORDING TO POLITICO CEV MC CARTHY IS FACING THE GREATEST PERIL TO HIS SPEAKERSHIP SINCE HE CLAWED HIS WAY INTO THE JOBATE MONTHS AGO WITH MULTIBLE FACTIONS OF HIS PARTY FUTING AND A LOOMING REVOLT AHEAD DURING A BATTLE TO FUN THE GOVERNMENT ALTORA CON SERVATIVE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE COPPE ARE TALKING IN UNSUTTLE TERMS ABOUT TURNING ON MOCARTHY AIF HE DOES NOT TAKE A HARD LINE IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE SENATEAND THE BY DEMINISTRATION AT LET ME JUST POINT OUT HERE JO BIDEN IN THE SENATE ALL THEY HAVE TO DO AS SAY WE'RE WILLINGTO NEGOTIATE IN THE NOT NEGOTIATE IN ORDER T WIN THIS BATTLE THEY MADE A CRUCIAL TACTICAL BLUNDER DURING THE LAST ROUND OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS JOBIDON PRE COMMITTED BEFOREHAND TO NOT NEGOTIATING THAT GAVE MC CARTHY ROOMS SAY THAT HE WAS THE NEGOTIATOR AND EVENTUALLY BY N HAD NEGOTIATE THE RULE IN THESE SORTS OF POLITICAL BRINGSMANSHIP SITUATION IS THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC OUR PRO WHICH EVER PARTY SHAYS THEL COME TO THE TABLE AND YOU SAY Y WON'T COME TOT TABLE THEN ALIKE YOU SO IF YOU'RE ALREADY STARTING OFF WITH WERE NOT COMING TO THE TABLE AND THE UNLESS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO GET FROM THE DEMOCRATS WELL THEN THE DEMOCRATS PROBABLY WIN THAT IN THE BATTLE OF PUBLIC OPINION MC CARTHY ACCORDING TO POLITICO IS A POLITICAL SURVIVOR EVEN HIS CRITICS CANNOT AND I HIS SKILLED NATURE AS AN ACCOMMIDATOR HIS PERSISTENCE IN WINNING OVER EVEN HIS MOST DOGET T CRITICTS BUT INTERVIEWS H MORE THAN TWO DOSEN SHUUP HE MEMBERS AN ADES REVEAL HITWOLD TAKE ONLY A FEW ROGUE LAW MAKERS HELL BENS ON HIS DOWNFALL TO RISK MC CARTHY'S FATIN AN ENTIRELY NEW WAY SENDING THER PARTY SPIRALLING INTO NEW PERIOTIVE CASS EVEN IF THOSE TEFECTORS FAILED TO ACTUALLY EJECT MOCARTHY SOME OFTHE SPEAKER'S CONFIDENCE PRIVATELY CONCEIDED THERE MAY BE NO WAY TO RECOVER ACCORDING TO BOB GOOD IS AVOCAL MC CARTHYTE TOTRACTOR HE SAYS THE SPEAKER FACEIS TWO CHOICES HE STARES DOWN THE SENATE STAIRS DOWN THE WHITE HOUSE FORCES THEM TO CAVE IN IS A TRANSFORMATIONAL HISTORIC SPEAKER OR HE CAN CHOOSE TO MAKE A DEAL WITH DEMOCRATS NOT LET ME JUST BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS THERE IS NO SITUATION WHICH HE DEALS NOT COT WIT DEMOCRATS YOU DON'T WON DTOR WHY BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS A DEMOCRAT SO IS THE SENATE WHAT IS AMAZING TO ME IS IT I AM MOREFISCALLY CONSERVATIVE THAN VIRTUALLY EVERY ONE IN CONGRESS I ALSO HAPPEN TO LIVE IN THIS WORLD CALLED REALITY WHERE YOU DON'T GET TO UNIA LATTERALLY DICTAKE THE TERMS OF ENGAGEMENTS WHEN THE OTHER SIDE HOLD MOST OF THE CARDS THE PRESIDENT HAS VEDO POWER THE PRESIDENTHASI THE ENTIRE MEDIA ON HIS SIDE AN CAN FIGHT THIS BATTLE YOU CAN SAY WHILLIUG NOW THE PRESIDENT REALLY SHOULD CAVE ON THIS AND SHOULD REALLY CAVE ON THIS AND YOU MIGHT BEABLE TO PRICE CERTAIN CONSESSIONS AWAY FROM BYDON THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THIS LAST TIME THEY GOT SOME SMALL CONCESSIONS FROM HIM BUT IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AFFECTUATING LARGE SCALE CHANGE WITH A DEMOCRAT PRESIDENT AND A DEMOCRAT SENATE GOOD LUCK TO YOU BY THE WAY YOU KNOW WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY HELPFUL HERE IS WINNING THAT WOULD BEEN SUPERHELPFUL IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO EFFECTUATE LARGE SKALL CHANGE NO'T BE GREAT CONTROLLING THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES CGUIES THAT BE ASUM ZOLLIN FOLK IS ON RUNNING GOOD CANDIDATES IN SWING DISTRICT HELL WHY DON'T WE FOCUS ON NOMINATING THE MOST ELECTABLE REPUBLICAN FOR PRESIDENT LIZZINGHAN DRIVE OUT DEMOCRATIC TURN OUT THAT MIGHT BE AWAY TO ACTUALLY EFFECTUATE LARGE SKALE CHANGE OR IS THE IDEA HERE THEY JUST YELL AT YOUR LEADERSHIP CLASS AND IN AND IF YOU YELLED TOM LONG ENOUGH THAN MAGIC HAPPENS I I DON'T KNOW BUT HONESTLY IT'S IT'S LIKE ONE OF THESE BAZAR TWEETS WHERE THE LOGIC GOES  SOMETHING LIKE STEP ONE YELLOW YOUR LEADERSHIP STEP TOO DOT DOT DOT STEP HREE FISCAL CONSERVATISM WY THE DOTOTTOT IS THE WHOLE THING GUIES YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT YOUR STRATEGY AND YOUR PLAY HERE IS AGAIN I'M NOT SAING YOU COUNT LEVERAGE MC CARTHIAN TO BEIN MORE CAN SERVATIVE I'M FINED WITH THAT I THINK THAT'S GOOD I THINK PRESSURE FROM HIS RIGHT IS A GOOD THING THE POINT I MAKINGIS TAT IF YOU START OFF WITH A SERIES OF DEMANDS THAT ARE UTTERLY UNREALISTIC AND AND IF THEIRE PEOPLE IN THE CONSERVATIVE EGOSYSTEM AND TE CONSERVAT IMMEDIATE EGOSYSTEM WHO SUGGEST THAT GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWNS ARE GOIG TO BE A WAVE TOWARD POLITICAL VICTORY HERE WITH A DEMOCRATIC SENET AND DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT WHEN YOU KNOW AT DEAL AS CAN GET SIGN I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT EXACTLY THE UPSIDE IS WHAT REPUBLICAN ALL REPUBLICANS NEED TO PROVIDE RIGHT NOW IS A SENSE OF SOBRIETY IS THE SENSE THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING SO ALL I'M ASKING FOR AS ALWAYS IS A PLAN THAT'S IT GIVE ME A PLAN A AH I DON'T LIKE ANY REPUBLICAN STRATEGY THAT IS NOT A STRATEGY AT ALL ITS AN IMPULSE IF T IF THE IF THE IMPULSE IS YELL AT MC CARTHY UNTIL GOOD THINGS HAPPEN THAT'S NOT A STRATEGY AND IT IS NOT A PLAN IF THE IMPULSE IS NOMINATE WHOMEVER AND RUN THEM AGAINST BIDING WITHOUT ANY PLAN FOR VICTORY WHAT'S THE PLAN IF THE PLAN IS SHOUT THAT THE LAST SELECTION CYCLE WAS STOLEN AND THEN HAVE KNOW PLANS TO ACTUALLY REVERSE THAT OR EXPLAIN EVEN HOW YOU WOULD ATTEMPT TO DO SO THAT'S NOT A PLAN THAT'S AN IMPULSE IMPULSES DO NOT MAKE FOR POLITICAL VICTORY NO DEMOCRATS HAVE CONTINUOUSLY PLANS IT'S WHAT THEY DO PROFESSIONALLY SO FOR EXAMPLE ACCORDING TO POLITICO IN HE PAST NINE DAYS STATE AND FEDERAL JUDGES THROUGH OUT TWO CONGRESSIONAL MAPS AND HELP THE DEMOCRATS OF WHAT A WORSE CASE INAREO IN OHIO  KICKING OFF AN UNUSUALLY BUSY REDISTRICT AN CALENDAR HEADING INTO THE ELECTION YEAR ALL TOLD A DOZEN OR MORE SEATS ACROSS AT LEAS SIX STATES COULD BE RE DRAWN IN CREASING THE LIKELY HO DEMOCRATS COULD CHIP AWAY THE FIVE SEAT GEOP E HOUSEMATRORTY THROUGH RE DISTRICTING ALONE DEMOCRATS COULD PICK UP AN EXTRA SEAT INCLUDING IN FLORDA ALLABAMA AND LOUISIAING TEIR DEEP BRED STATES PERHAPS SEVERAL MORE IN NEW YORK WREPUBLICANS COULD STILL PIC UP AS MANY AS FORCEATS O NORTH CAROLINA BUT THE RECENT RULINGS PUT DEMOCRATS IN A POSITION TO OFFSET SOME OF THOSE LOSSES AND THEN SUM SO AGAIN THEY ARE FINDING JUDGIS WHO ARE OVERTHROWING THESE DISTRICTS THAT ARE DRAWN AND THEN THEY ARE BASICALLY CREATING DEMOCRATIC DISTRICTS THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING RIGHT NOUT THAT IS A PLAN WHEN REPUBLICANS BY THEWAY PLAY THE GAME THEY CAN WIN HIS THE OTHER THING IS THIS NOTION OUT THERE THAT REPUBLICANS CAN'T PLAY THE GAME ICS THE GAME IS RIGED BET AN WHEN IT COMES TO BALLA HARVESTING YES REPUBLICANS CAN PLAY TAT GAME AND THEY CAN WIN THAT'SWHAT HAPPEN IN FLORTED DURING THE LAST ELECTION CYCLE YES THE JUDICIARY WAS RIGGED AGAINST REPUBLICANS AND THEN REPUBLICANS CREATED THE FEDERAL AF SOCIETY AND SPENT THIRTY YEARS BUILDING UP AN ENTIRE BENCH OF JUDICIAL NOMINES AND THEN TOO CONTROL THE SUPRIM COURK SO YES YOU CAN DO THIS BUT IT REQUIRES ACTUAL PLANS I UNDERSTAND THAT THE EASIEST THING IN POLITICS TO THINK FOR TO DAY AND MAYBE FOR TO MORROW BUT NEVER FOR TEN YEARS FOR NOW THAT'S NOT GOING TO ACHIEVE IT AND AND HERE'S THE BIG QUESTION WHAT EXACTLY DO EXPECT MC CARTHY TO DO MC CARTHY'S ACTUALLY GIVING US WHAT WE WANT I SAY US TO CONSERVATIVE NOT FROM O SPENDING WHICH IS NOT CAPABLE OF DOING AND NO ONE'S CAPABLE OF DOING ANBY THE WAY I DO FIND IT IRONIC THAT MANY OF THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE SHOUTING BY HAMOCARTHY IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY CONSERVATIVE UNSPENDING OUR TALKING ABOUT THE WONDERS OF OF FOR EXAMPLE PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO SAYS WE SHOULD NOT RESTRUCTURE SOCIAL SECURITY MEDICAR ORMETICADE WHICH ARE THE BIGGEST SPENDING PROGRAMS IN AMERICAN LIFE BARNON BUT PUT THAT ASIDE MC CARTHY IS IN FACT MOVING TOWARD N IM PEACHMEN INQUIRY IF THAT SOMETHING YOU CARE ABOUT MC CARTHY'S DOING IT ACCORDING TO FOX NEWS CEVE MC CARTHY WILL TELL HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO DAY BEGINNG AN IM PEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST BIDON IS THE LOGICAL NEXT STEP THE HOUSE JOP CONFERENCE PLANS TO HOLD THE MEETING ON THURSDAY MORNING FOR A KEE COMMITTE CHAIRS TO LAY OUT THEIR LATEST FINDINGS AND THE STATUS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE BITDON FAMILY HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTE CHAIRMAN AT REPRESENTIVE JIM JORNAF OHIO AND HOUSE OVER SYE COMITEE CHAIRMAN T REPRESENTIVE JIM'S COMER OF KENTUCKY ARE EXPECTED TO LEAD THE METING AT THE MEETING MC CARTHY IS EXPECTED TO SAY IN IN PEACHMEAN INQUIRY IS THE LOGICAL NET STEP FOR THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY SO THAT WILL OBVIOUSLY LAUNCH THIS INTO HIRE GEAR TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN LAMACS WOULD NEED TO SUPPORTN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AGAINST BIDON IS NOT CERTAIN THAT ACTUALLY THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE THE VOTES TO DO IT THERE'S SEVERAL JEOPEE LAMAKERS INCLUDING KEN BUCK AND DON BACON OF NEBRASKA HAVE VOIC SKEPTICISM ABOUTIN PEACHMEN WHICH IS INTERESTING BECAUSE BUCK IS AF FISCL CONSERVATIVES ALSO PUSHING MC CARTHY FROM THE RIGHT IN TERMS OF SPENDING SAIDS CUT IT'S COME FROM WEIRD BAD FELLOWS HERE BUT MC CARTHY IS VERY PLIABLE TO HIS OWN MEMBERSHIP THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU DON'T GIVE MANY OPTIONS HE'S GOT NO OPTIONS SO HOW ABOUT THIS HOW ABOUT FOLCUS ON YOU KNOW THE MEASURES THAT ARE LIKELY TO LEAD TO ELECT TO R VICTORIES YOU CAN ACTUALLY EFFECTUATE CHANGE TTHERE'S BEEN THE EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING REPUBLICAN AND CONSERVATIVE AND AND DEM POLITICS IT ALL WHICH IS LIKE FOURTEEN THIRTEEN YEARS OLD I'VE NOTICED IN AN EXTRAORDINARY TENDENCY AMONG THOSE IN THE ACT OF HIS BASE TO SIMPLY SAY OVER AND OVER AND OVER THAT THEY WISH A THING TO BE AND THEN IF THE POLITICIANS DON'T MAKE THE THING HAPPEN THEN THE POLITICION TO FAIL WHAT IF THE THING THATYOU AR WISHING FOR IS NOT POSSIBLE UNDER THE CURREN CIRCUMSTANCES BUT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE WITH A LITTLE BIT OF ACTUAL FORETHOUGHT A GAIN JUST ONE SECOND WE ARE GOING TO GET TO CRIME AT PROBES

RICHER AREAS ALSO HAVE TO SUFFER FROM PEOPLE BEING SHOT ON THE REGULAR SO THAT THAT IS THAT THAT IS EXCITING STUFF IN WASHINGTON TO SEE KEEP VOTING DEMOCRAT ITS WORKING OUT GRAT FOR YOU T SAME THING HAPPENING OVER IN PHILADELPHIA BY THE WAY THERE'S NUVIDIO THA IS EMERGED FROM PHILADELPHIA SHOWING ATTICS ON THE STREET IN A TRANCE LIKE STATE PASSED OUT ON THE SIDEWALK OF THE CITY'S MULTIPLE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT I MEAN IF THIS IS NOT HORRIFYING THURDWOLD CRAP I'M NOT SURE WHAT IS THIS IS KENSINGTON AREAS IN PHILADELPHIA FOR THOSE CAN'T SEE THO IDIO I'S PEOPLE LITERALLY JUST LYING ON THE

KENSINGTON HAS ONE O THE HIGHEST DRUGRATES IN THE CITY APPARENTLY ONE OF THE M ONE OF THE WORST DRUG'S ON THE STREET RIGHT NOW IS IS A DRUG KNOWN IS TRANK FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW THAT IS A POTENT ANIMAL TRANQUILIZER CALLED ZILAZINE IS A POWERFUL SEDATIVE AND A PEOPLE MIX IT WITH FENTINEL TO MAKE THAT EVEN DEGLIER AND WORSE THAT 'S SOMETHING NEW YOURK TIME'SBEEN REPORTING ON FOR A WHILE BACK IN JANUARY THEREIS ENTIRE STORY ABOUT THIS SEY ZILASSINE CAUSES WOUNDS THAT ERUPT WITH A SCALY DEAD TISSUE CALLED ESCAR UNTREATED IT CAN LEAD TO AMPUTATION IN INDUCES A BLACK OUT STUPER FOR HOURS RENDERING USERS VULNERABLE TO RAPE AND ROBBERY WHEN PEOPLE COME TOO A HIGH FROM THE FENTINEL HAS LONG SINCE FATED THE IMMEDIATELY CRAVE MORE BECAUSE ZILAZINE IS A SETITIVE NOT AN OPIOID IT RESISTS STANDARD OPIOID OVERDOS REVERSAL TREATMENTS MORE THAN NINETY PER CENT OF PHILADELPHIA'S LAB TESTED DOPE SAMPLES ARE NOW POSITIVE AT FERZILAZINE IT'S TOO LATE FOR PHILLY SAID SHAWN AT WESTFALL OUTREAGE WORKER WITH PROVENTION POINT PHILADELPHIA THIRTY YERLDS HEALTH SERVICES CENTER IN KENSINGTON PHILLY SUPPLY IS SATURATED IF OTHER PLACES AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE A CHOICE TO AVOID EIT THEY NEED TO HEAR OUR STORY A STUDY PUBLISHED IN JUNE HAS DETECTEVE ZILAINE IN THE DRUG SUPPLY IN THIRTY SIX STATES AS WELL AS DCEE IN NEW YORK CITY ZILASIN HAS BEEN FOUND IN TWEN TY FIVE PER CENT OF DRUG SAMPLES BUT THE SATURATION IS  CERTAINLY GREATER AND THIS IS SCARY SCARY STUFF THE DRUG EXISTS IN A LEGAL GRAZOWN IT WAS IMPROVED FIFTY YEARS AGO BY THE FT A AS A VETERINARIAN PRESCRIBED THE ANAL JESIC IT'S NOT LIS IT AS CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE FOR ANIMALS ARE HUMAN SOT'S NOT SUBJECT TO STRICT MONERING BUT IT'S STARTED OF COURSE WITH THEM PRESCRIPTION OPBIOIDS WHEN THO THOSE CAME HARD TO COME BY PEOPLE STARTED MOVING ON TO TRANK SO THIS IS WHAT WE'VE DONE TO LARGE SWATS OF OUR POPULATION ITS IT'S ALL WORKING OUT GRAT BY THE WAYGUISES ALL ALL THIS IS WORKING OUT BEAUTIFULLY PROBABLY A LITTLE BET WMERE LEFT WING POLICES WILL FIX THESE CITIES EL MAYBE MAY WE HAVE SOME YOU KNOW NEEDLE EXCHANGES FOR THE TRANK THAT'LL THAT'LL DEFINITELY HELP ONE MAYBEF WE GET RID OF THE COPSE CAS REALLY THE PROME HERE IN SYSTEMAC RACISM YOW AS I SAID ORALEAR WHEN I CAME TO TE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS YELLING AT BAD THINGS IN LIFE IS NOT A SOLUTION TO THE BAD THINGS AND YET THAT SEEMS TO BE THE POLICY THAT IS BEING FOLLOWED IN THESE CITIES I DON'T LIKE TRANK IS NOT A SOLUTION TO DRINK I DON'T LIKE HOME LEZOMBIES ON THE STREET IS NT A SOLUTION TO HOMELIZOMBSON THESTREE YOU KNOT'S A SOLUTION ORE LAW IN FORCE ME NOT'S A SOLUTION MANITORY DRUG DRYING OUT YOU NOTSU IN ACTUAL SOLUTION IN VOLUNTARY COMMENTMENT FROM MENTALLY ELL THESE OURE ACTUAL SOLUTIONS THE RE QUERE ACTUAL FUNDING AND THEY FIX THE PROBLEM BUT THAT MAY REQUIRE SOMEMODY ACTUALLY HAVE THE COURAGE TO SEE THAT IN AN AREA WORE S NOT POPULAR AND MORE THAN THAT IS NOT ABOUT COURAGE MY POLITICIANS IT'S ABOUT VOTERS COMING TO GRIPS WITH REALITY AT A CERTAIN POINT CAMPLIN THE POLITICIONS ANY MORE IF WERE NOT CUTTING OUR DAT MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT A CUT OUR DET LEM POLITICIONS MUCH AS YOU WANT OR WE CAN LAME THE FACT THAT PEOPLE HAVE NO CAPACITY TO THINK SECOND ORDER WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICS ALREADY FOLKS TIME FOR SOME THINGS AT THAT ILAY AL RETTY WELL ONE OF THNGS WE LIKE HERE AT THE MENSPIRSHOWS BURSTCOLD THAN ONE OF OUR BIGGEST SPONSOR IS OBVIOUSLY AND WE TALK WITH THEM AVERES OFFEN ABOUT THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY JOINING US ON THE LINE WRIGHT NOW AS FILL A PATRIC A PRECIOUS METAL SPECIALIST FROM BERSGOLL SO PHILIP LET'S TALK ABOUT THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY I MN RIGHT NOW JOBINE IS CLAIMING WE HAVE STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH IN FLATION IS COMING UNDER CONTRAL HOW TO OU SEE IT YE I MEAN LE YOU CAN CHERY PICK THE NUMBERS AN SERTAINLY MAKE THAT ARGUMEN BUT I THINK ITS O MISTAKE TO SIK IST JUST ON ECONOMIC GROS AN THE REAL QUESTION I THINK IS IS HOW IS THE ECONOMY WORKING TO MACE AMERICANS IN THE NUMBERS REALLY DON'T THE GOOD O FOR THE LOST TWO AN A HARF YEARS LICAT TO RICEIS AT HOME UP TWENTY PER CENT ELECTRICITY UP TWENTY ONE GASTLYNG PRICEIS UP SEVENTY TWO PER CNT LET'S TIC OF PEOPLE'S BIKUST EXPENSE RIHT AM HOUSING REN PAYMENTS RACE TWENTY FICE PER SAND MEDIAN MORTGAE PAYMENTS UP EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT AND VERY IMPORTANTY WAGE TRACE IS TRAILED IN FLACTION CONSISTENTLY AN IN AL THER WORDS IF ITS NOT JUST OUR IMAGINATION VUST TIRHTY EVERYESENSIAL IS MORE EXPENS IV TO DAY THEN IT WAS BEFORE BIDIN GOT IN OFFICE AND WAG JUST JUST HAVEN'T KEPT UP I CANSUMAT DAT IS RECENLY HID AN OLD TIME IOVER TRILIAN DOLLARS FOR THE FIRST TIME O I THINK PEOPLET DESPERATELY TRYING TO MAINTAIN THEIR LIVING STANDITS IN THE FACE OF BY D NOT MAKE SLI TIN TAT'S TO REALITY FOR MOST AMERICANS TO DAY DESPITE HOW WE TRING DRESS UP THE NUMBER SO PHILLIP ONE O THE THINGSTHAT THEIR CLAIMING NOW IS THAT THEY'VE BROUGHT INFLATION UNDER CONTROL THE FELLOW RES ARVE OBVIOUSLY HAS INCREASED INTEREUST RATES TO SKY HIGHRATES IS WHY MORTGAGES ARE NOW CLARKING IN AT SEVEN EIGHT PER CENT NOW THE REALITY IS THAT BY HISTORICAL AVERAGES THE INTERESTRATE TARNS ACTUALLY ALL THAT HIGH ET THIS POINT BUT ALSO THE THE INFLATION RATE IS NOT ALL THAT LOWL AT THIS POINT IS A LAT A TALKWRIHT NOW ABOUT THE INFLACTIU RAN BEING UNDER CONTROL BUT THE USUALLY TIRRNG IT TWO PER CENT IT'S ITS WELL AN ACCESS OF THREE PER CENTSILS AR STILL FIFTY PER CENT TOO HIGH BUT THEY'RE TILL CLAIMING NOW THAT MAY THEYR AN A STOP WITH THE INCREASES IN THE INTEREST RAYE YET THE LOINFLATION GENERALLY AS GOOD GOOD NEWS RI BUT THIS A COUPLE OF POINTS TO REMEMBER FIRST OF ALL INFLATION IS CUMULATIVE R I DETEND PER CENT INFLATION RA ONE YEAR FOLLOWED BY FIVE PER CENT NEXT MEANS THAT EVERYTHING COST FIFTEEN PER CENT MORE SO EASING INFLATION DOESN'T MEAN A RETURN OF PURCHASING POWERITS JUST DESTROYING IT MORE SLOWLY NOW THE OTHER SIDE OF THINGS WHICH I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT IS THE FEDS PREFERRED MEASURE OF INFLATION WHICH IS CORPC PERSONAL CON SUMPTION EXPENDITURES THEY'VE BEEN MORE THAN DOUBLE AS YOU MENTION THE TWO PER CENT TARKET FOR YEARS NOW THE ONLY THING THAT'S REALLY BEEN DRIVING THAT HEADLINE INFLATION NUMBER DOWN AS BEEN ENERGY PLATORS AND OF COURSE THEIR STARTING TO CREE UPIC AND OYAL HEAT NINETY DOLLARS A BAREL JUST A FEW DAYS AGO IT'S PARTICULARLY CONCERNING TO LETTING WHAT IS SHOWING US NOW THAT IS I INFLATION IS BECOMING INTRENCHED IN THE ECONOMY AND I THINK YOU KNOW THIS TWO PER CENT TARKET THE FED HAVE MAY BE A PIPE DREEM FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE ITS PROVING PARTICULARLY SICKLY AT THE MOMENT IN THOLD ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BECOME PATENTLY OBVIAUS REALLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTY THOUSAN ATES HOW MUCH POWER THE CENTRAL BANKERS HAVE OVER THE ECONOMY AND THERE USED TO BE A TIME S NOW DECADES TOGO WHERE LEGISLATURES REALLY HAD SORT OF THE CHIEF CONTROL OVER THE ECONOMY AND YOU COULD HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE IF THE POLICIES WERE BAWD THERE IS STILL AN INTEREST IN SOME LEVEL OF THISICAL DISCIPLINE BECAUSE YOU COULN' JUST PRINT DOLLARS WILL ENILLY IN THEN PUMP THEM INS THE ECONOMY OR BELOW THE DEBT OFF FOR A COUPLE OF GENERATIONS O VE  SESS NOT TRUE ANY MORE AND THAT MEANS THAT THE CENTRAL BANKSTEM CAN GIVEN US EXTRAORDINARY POWER TO CONTROLL HOW MUCH YOU'RE DOLLARS ARE WORTH PARTICULARLY ONES YOU VARY PAY TAXIDONE IN TERE IN THE BANKARAY YE I MENEED'S ABSURD THE POWER THAT THE FEDERERS AVE HAVE AYS IS REALLY SHOWING ITSELF IN TO DAYS ECONOMY AND THE REALITY IS AS YOU MENTION THEIRE AN UNELECTED BODY WE REALLY CAN'T HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE AND YOU KNOW THIS FEDERESERVE HAS A PROBLEM AS WELL YOU KNOW THAT THE TOOLS THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE I THINK OF VERY LIMITED THEIR ABILITY TO RAS RATE SIGNIFICANTLY ENOUGH TO CRUSH INFLATION IS LIMITED THET TO WHAT THEY DID TO THE BANKS EARLIER THIS YEAR AND OU KNOW THE ABILITY TO FIX THE ECONOMY BY LOWERING RATES AND STIMULATING ALL SO VERY LIMITED AS WELL SO THEY'VE GOT THEIR HANDS TIGED BEHIED THEIR BACK BUT BUT I AGREE WITH YOU THE FEATHERS AS A BODY THE POWER THAT THEY HAVE OVER THE ECONOMY IS CONCERNING WHEN THEYRE UNELECTED AND AND UNACCOUNTABLE MISSMING TE THIL PATERIC'S A PRECIOUS METAL SPECTUALIST AND ISPOKESMEN FOR BURCE GOLD GROUPS OL THOL I GET THE QUESTION ALL THE TIME THAT IN IN A REALLY SORT OF UNEAS E ECONOMY LIKE THIS IN A REALLY IS UNEASY NO ONE KNOWS OBVIOUSLY WHERE WHERE TO PUT THEIR MONEY IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE THE REAL ESTATE MARKET IS GOING TO HAVE SOME SORT OF SELL OFF HERE JUST BECAUSE THE MORTGAGE RATES ARE SO HIGH AS LOST STICKINESS BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T ACTUALLY WANT TO SELL THEIR HOMES BEAUSE THEN TEYLL HAVE T TAKE A NEW MORTGAGE THAT ISN'T GOIN TO BE AT TWO POINT FIVE PERESENTIS CAN TO BE AT SEVEN PER CENT BUT IT SOME POINT PEOPLE WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS THEYLL LOSE THEIR SAVINGS THAN THERE GAN A HAVE TO SELL THOSE HOUSES THE SAME THINGS HAPPENING IN COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE I' BEN TALKING WITH PEOPLE IN COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE AND THE OCCUPANCY RATES ARE AR DROPPING FAIRLY RAPIDLY AT THIS POINT AND THET THEMMINGS THE UNDERLYING VALUE IS IS REALLY GOING DOWNTHE LOSTR JOURNAL HAS WIDELY REPORTED THIS MEANWHILE WHEN COMES TO THE STOCK MARKET A LOT OF UNEASINESS THERE NEW I PIOS ARE DOING A FRACTION FWHAT THEY WARE DOING JUST A COUPLE OF OF YEARS AGO AND AND MEANWHILE IF YOU IF YOU PUT YOUR MONEY INTO A MONEY MARKET ACCOUNT YOU MIGHT BE EARNING THE BEST RETURN IT IS A VERY CONFUSING ECONOMY N OBVIOUSLY OF A VESTED INTEREST AN WITH BIRCH GOALD BUT WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND IN TERMS OF THINGS LIKE PRECIOUS METALS IS A HEDGE AGAINST ALL THIS THE GITHING PRECIOUS METALS WERE VERY VERY WELL INCLIMATES LIKE THIS SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR PROBLEM SRI WE HAVE INTATION WHICH WE MENTION WE HAVE PETENTIAL RESESTION ON THE HORIZON TI INTO THAT I THINK WE HAVE ISSUES WITH OUR CORRENTSY LONGER TON THE WORLD SEEMS TO BE  THESE AMOUNT DISTANT SIN FROM THE DOLLA THESE THINGS OF COURSE VERY NEGATIIVE IN ISOLATION BUT VERY POSITIVE DRI JUST TOSAT HATEAN COMMODITES LIKE GOLDEN SO  US A THE CLIMATES REALLY GOOD AND AS UMENTION IN I BEOCTIONS OUT THERE THE MOMENT AR VERY LIMITIT A PRECIOUS METALS MAKE A TONOF SENSIN CLIMATS LIKE THIS  PHILI PATRIC PRECIOUS METAL SPECIALIST POKSMEN FOR BIRCHGOLL GRU BREALLY

SOME THINGS THAT I HATE SO WHAT'S GOING ON IN ISRAEL RIHT NOWIS ACTUALLY QUITE ASTONISHING OM THE  SUPREME COURT OF ISRAEL IS CLAIMING THAT IT HAS THE ABILITY TO STRIKE DOWN LITERALLY ANY LAW INCLUDINGWHAT THEY CALL THE BASIC LAW IN ISRAEL FOR VIOLATING THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE FOR ISRAELSO LET ME PUT THIS IN CONTECT AND IT THIS HAS RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE THIS IS THE WAY THAT THE LEFT  LOVE TO SEE COURTZ RULE IN THE FUTURE AND INHOW THE COURTZ OF RULED IN THE PAST SO BASICALLY HEARS THE WAY WORKS THE UNITED STATES IS WORLLY LUCKY BE AVE WRITTEN CONSTITUTION WHICH MEANS THAT THE VERY LEAST YOU CAN REFER TO THAT DOCUMENT TO DETERMIN WHAT EXACTLY QUARTS CAN'T DO AND CAN'T DO IN TERMS OF STRIKING THINGS DOWN WHALE LAGE WELL LEGISLATURES CANACCANNOT DO ISRAEL ISN'T HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT ISRAEL HAS A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WHICH IS NOT A PIECE OF LAW IT IS A ISESY STATEMENT OF BROAD PURPOSES ABOUT HOW ISRAEL SHULD BE JEWISH AND DEMOCRATIC BUT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT IT IS IT'S NOT LAW THERE'S NO CONSTITUTION THERE BECAUSE THE IS REALLIES COULDN'T COME TO SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT ABOUT HOW EXACTLY THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD WORK WHAT LAWS WE IN BOUNDS WHAT WHAT WAS CONSTITUTIONAL WHAT WAS NOT S THEY BASICALLY JUST A REED TO DISAGREE THAT MEANS THAT EVERY SO OFTEN THEY PASS WAT THEY CALL A BASIC LAW A BASIC LAW IS A PIECE OF MAJORITARIAN LEGISLATION THAT THEN CARRIES WITH IT IN INABILITY TO OVERRIDE THAT LAW EXCEPT WITH  SORT OF A SUPERMAJORITY THESE BASIC LAWS EXIST THAT   BEEN CREATED THROUGHOUT IS RAILY HISTORY THE SUPREME COURT OF ISRAEL TYPICALLY HAS USED BASIC LAW IN ORE TO STRIKE DOWN NON BASIC LAW SIN THE SAME WAY THAT THE SPRIME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES WILL USE THE CONSTITUTION TO STRIKE DOWN PARTICULAR LEGISLATION THE SAME THING SORT OF HAPPENS HERE IN ISRAEL THE SPRIM COURT HISTORICALLY HAS USED THE BASIC LAWS AS IT AS A WAY OF STRIKING DOWN NON BASIC LAW NOW IN THE NINETEENINETIES THERE IS A SEIZURE OF POWER BY THE  SUPREME COURT AND THEY DECIDED THAT FROM NOW ON THEY COULD BASICALLY JUST LIKE REASONABLENESS TO STRIKE DOWN A VARIETY OF EXECUTIVE ACTIONS AND LEGISLATION WELL BE BINITYN OW WHOSE CRRENT COLITION THY SAID THE UPREME COURT HAS TO MUCH POWER R DON'T WANT THEM TO DO THAT ANY MORE SENARIGAN HAVE TO SITE SOMETHING THAT'S NOT REASONABLENESS IF YOU AN A STRIKE DOWN LEGISLATION AND THEY WANT O MAKE THE SABASIC LAW ARE THEY THEY VACTIIN COTED THIS IN A BASIC LAWSING THIS WILL NOW BE THE LAW OF THE STATE O ISRAEL AND IT IS CONSIDERED QUASI CONSTITUTIONAL SO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THE BIG QUESTION THAT'S NOW COME UP BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT IS WHETHER THE SUPREME CORT OF ISRAEL CAN STRIKE DOWN A BASIC LAW IN THE NAME OF UM IN TNHAME OF LIC AGAIN NORMALL IN THE UNITED STATES YUSE THE CONSTITUTION TO STRIKE DOWN AT BADPIECE  LEGISLATION IN ISRAEL THE BASIC LAW IS THE QUASI CONSTITUTIONAL HIGHEST LAW HOW CAN TE SUPREME COURT SITE SOMETHING ELSE TO STRIKE DOWN A BASIC LAW SO THE ARGUMENT THAT'S CURRENTLY HAPPENING AT THE SUPREME CORT LEVEL IS WHETER THE SUPREME COURT CAN USE THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE TO STRIKE DOWN A LAW TAY THAT IMAGINE IF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES WENT BACK TO THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND SAD THAT BECAUSE THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE SAYS THE YOU HAVE THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS THAT MEANS THAT WE CAN STRIKE DOWN ANYTHING WE WANT WE' ALL GO WO WHO GAVE YOU THAT POWER THAT'S NOT LIKE THAT'S A PRETT VAGUE SENTIMENT FREE TO STRIKE DOWN THINGS BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT ISRAEL SUPREME COURT IS NOW DECLARING TEY'RE NOW DECLARING THAT BECAUE THEY DON'T LIKE THE CURRENT LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL THEY HAVE WILLY NILLY POWER TO STRIKE DOWN ANYTHING THEY WANT IN THE NAME OF AN INCREDIBLY VBAGUE DOCUMENTS THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDS OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL WHICH IS NOT IN FACT PRACTICAL LAW IT DOES NOT SPELL OUT HOW THE STATE OF ISRAEL ISPOSED TO WORK IT DOES NOT SPELL OUT HOW THE CANNETSET IS SUPOSED TO WORK IT DOES NATSPELL OUT VIRTUALLY ANY OF THESE THINGS IT HAS A BUNCH OF SORT OF BASE LINE STATEMENTS ABOUT WHAT THEY HOPE THE STATE OF ISRAEL WILL BE I TALKING ABOUT OW IT WILL FOSTER THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY FOR THE BENEFIT OF ITS INHABITANTS AND WILL BE BASED ON FREEDOM JUSTICE AND PIEACE AND WILL ENSURE COMPLETE EQUALITY OF SOCIOAL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS AND WILL GUARANTY FREEDOM OF RELIGION CONSCIONSE LANGUAGE EDUCATION AND CULTURE BUT THOSE ARE PRETTY VAGUE STATEMENS TO STRIKE DOWN A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT SIMPLLY SAYS THE SUPREME COURT DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO SAY THAT SOMETHING IS UNREASONABLE AND THEN STRIKE IT DOWN IF THE SUPREME COURT WERD DO THIS ITS CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS IN ISRAEL IS EFFECTIVELY WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS THAT ELECTIONS CAN BE OVERITTEN BY THE UPREME COURT ANYTIME THAT ANY TIME A BASIC LAWS ESTABLISH WHICH AGAIN IS SUPPOSED TO WOU BE IS THOUGH THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES AND VARIOUS STATE LEGISLATURES PASSED TE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION AND THE SUPREME OURT THEN STEPPED IN AND SAID IN THE NAME OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENE WE STRIKE DOWN THIS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT BY WELL YOU CAN'T DO THAT NO ONE GAVE YOU THE POWER TO DO THAT THAT'S BASICALLY WAS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW ACCORDING TO THE TIMESOF ISRAEL DURING FRAUGHT EXCHANGES BETWEEN THE COURT AND THE ATTORNEYS DEFENDING THE LEGISLATION ONE JUSTICE INDICATED ISRAEL'S DEMOCRACY WAS AT STAKE AGAIN I HAVE TO SAY THE IRONY OF PEOPLE SPEAKING IN THE NAME OF JUDICIAL TYRANNY SAYING THAT THE'RE DOINGS ON BEHALF A DEMOCRACY IS REALLY GALLING IT'S REALLY REALLY GALLING BASICALLY THE SUPREME COURT RIGHT NOW IS ARGUING THERE SHOULD BE NOTELIC NAME YOUR LIMITS WHAT ARE THE LIMITS ON TE SUPREME COURT OF ISRAEL THERE ARE NONE ACCORDING TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ISRAEL AND ACCORDING TO MANY OF ITS SUPPORTERS THEY LOST IN ELECTION THEY DON'T LET THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTIONS O NOW THEY'RE GOING TO USE THE SUPREME COURT TOBASICALLY ESTABLISH THAT THERE ARE NO LIMITS AT ALL YOU LON BONBACK IS THE ATTORNY REPRESENDING O THE GOVERNMENT THE ARGUE THE JUSTICES ARE EMPOWERED TO INTERPRET THE LEGISLATOR'S WORDS THERE'S NO LEGAL OR CONSTITUTIONAL BASIS FOR THEM TO REVIEW BASIC LAWS IN RESPONSE  JUSTICE ALIC STINE ASKEBON BACK WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF THE CONNACIT AUTHORITY TO LEGISLATE LAWS BONBACK POINT TO TO I NINETEEN FIFTY SUPREME COURT RULING STIN NOTER THA THECONNESSIT WAS FORM BEFORE THAT THE ORIGINAL POWER SOURCE WAS IN THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WELL YES IN THE SENSE THAT IT SAYS THERE SOULD BE ELEGISLATTURPRETED DOESN'T HAVLIC SPECIFIC PROVISIONS ON HOW LISTS O WORK ALL THAT WAS ESTABLISHED LATER OTHER JUSTICES ALSO CHALLENGED BONBACK INDICATING THAT IN THEIR VIEWS SINCE THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE TO FINDS ISRAEL AS A JEWISION DEMOCRATIC STATE THE CANNESSET CANNOT LEGISLATE LAWS EVEN BASIC LAWS THET ARE RODE ISRAELS JEWISH OR DEMOCRATIC CHARACTER WHICH MEANS THAT THE HIGH COURT CONTIMALLY STRIKE DOWN WHATEVER IT WANTS TO SIGN STRIKE DOWN WHICH IS PRETTY AMAZING STUFF AGAIN THE DECLARASIOMENT DEPENDENCE OFTH STATE OF ISRAEL IS IN FACT A BASIC DOCUMENT BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THA IT EMPOWERS THE SUPREME COURT TO OVERRIDE ANYTHING IN THE NAME OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE ANY MORE THAN THE SUPREME COURT T OF THE UNITED STATES CAN USE THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WHICH THEY FAR MORE IMPORTANT DOCUMENT TO THE WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO TO STRIKE DOWN LAW THE SUPREME CORTAMOST NEVER SITES THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE BECAUSE THERE IS NO PURPOSE TO DOING SO IT IS NOT A PIECE OF LEGISLATION IF IF THE SUPREME COURT N ISRAEL DOES THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A A RATHER LARGE MASS CAUSE A HUGE PERCENTAGE OF THESEREALY POPULATIONSE AN BELIEVE THAT ELECTIONS BASICALLY HAVE NO CONSEQUENCES AT ALL UNLES YOU'RE ON THE LEFT IN WHICH CASE THEY JUS RUN ROUGH SHOT THAT'S REALLY NEGATIVE STUFF AND I'VE I'VE RAILED IN THE UNITED STATES AGAINST PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES DOING THIS ROUTINE WHERE IF THE BAD GUISE WHIN THAT MEANS THE DEMOCRACY IS OVER THERE DRING IT N ISRAEL TO IT'S REALLY BAD FOR ANY CIVILIZATION AR DIGIZE THE REST OF THE SHOW IS CONTINUING RIGHT NOW IN OCONORMISIT WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM WICH APPARENTLY

OF US WILL ASK A QUESTION AND NOBODY WILL RESPOND A SILENT PANIC FALLS OVER US IT IS A MOMENT THAT DEMAND'S LEADERSHIP DECISIVE ACTION WE TURN OUR HEADS TO OUR CAPTAIN MAX HE FOUND THIS BOAT NAMED IT AFTER HIS MOTHER SOLD US ON THE DREAM AND NOW LIKE A MONOMONIACAL A HAB IN A RED SOCKS CAP MAX DENIES THERE'S ANY PROBLEM AT ALL WHEN WE ARE LL WONDERING WHAT TO DO ONE ELEMENT OTIR WAS EVERYONE SAYING SHOULD WE CALL FOR HELP AND MAXAYING NO MAX HAT IS REALLY STRONG INSTANCT DON'T CALL FOR HELP DON'T CALHT I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING I THINK MAX WAS TRYING TO COVER UP FOR HER THIS MASSIVE FUCK UP AND SO HE HE WAS SORT OF DENIL THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM EVEN UP TO THE POINT WHERE THE ENTIRE BACK IND OF THE BOAT WAS FULLY UNDER WATER THE ENTIRE MOTOR WAS UNDER WATER MAX WAS STILL SAYING IT'S FINE THERE'S NO PROBLEM BUT THERE ARE TOO ONE WERE STRANDED IN THE WATER AND TOO OUR CAPTAIN HAS GONE MAD WE ONLY KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THE LAST ONE EVERYONE SHOUTS AT MAX ADMITTED WE ARE IN TROUBLE YOU NEED TO CALL FOR HEL BUT MAX IS SITTING IN THE CAPTAIN SEA ONE HAND CLENCHED AROUND THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE OTHER TURNING THE KEY IN THE MISSION LIKE THE ENGINE WASN'T UNDER WATER THE EXPRESSION HOPE FLOATS NOT TRUE AND VERY DANGEROUS ON ONE END OF THE SPECTRUM A WILLINGNESS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS SITUATION THERE IS MAX WHO IS JUST LIKE FACE FORWHERE PRETENDING HE WAS STILL DRIVING ABOAT AND THEN AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECT ROM THE OTHER EXTREME WAS THERE IS THERE'S THIS ONE WILD CARD CAT OH MY GOD I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HER SHE JUST LIKE A SORT OF APPEARED IN A BEAM OF CLARITY CAX SPANGLER WHEN TO COLLEGE WITH MAX SHE IS THE NINTH PASSENGER AND THE ONE OUTSIDER WHEN MAX INVITED HER ON A RIDE HE AD NOT MENTION THERE WOULD BE SO MANY OF US FOR MOST OF THE TRIP SHE WAS SHY AND OFF TO THE SIDE BUT NOW THE STRANGERS SURROUNDING HER OUR SCREAMING AT THE ONE PERSON SHE KNOWS AND HE HAS LOST CONTROL I REMEMBER JUST REALLY CLEARLY LIKE LOOKING OVER AT MAX SITTING THERE IN THE CAPTAIN SEE WITH HIS EYES KIND OF DOWN CAST FROZEN AND SOMETHING THERE WAS LIKE A SWITCH THAT FLIPPED IN ME IF THE BOAT SINKS AND ALL OF US ARE IN THE HARBOUR WE'RE NO LONGER VISIBLE TO ANYONE WE'RE JUST LITTLE HEAD SNO ONE CAN SEE US WE CAN TREAD WATER FOR A WHILE WHAT IF WE GET A CRAMP GET TIRED SWALLOW WATER HOW LONG CAN WE DO THAT FOR WHAT IF THE CURRENT TAKES US OUT FURTHER I DIDN'T WANT TO LET MYSELF GO THERE BUT I REMEMBER THINKING THAT PEOPLE WERE GOING A DIE IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING PEOPLE R IN A DIE TO DAY AND IN THAT MOMENT CAPTAIN CAT IS BORN MY MIND WENT REALLY BLANK AND CALM AND IS LIKE A CALCULATOR FILLED MY BRAIN AND I WAS JUST VERY LOGICAL AND I STARTED FOCASSING ON ACTIONS WHERE ARE THE LIFE FAST HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE I TOOK ON THIS VOICE THAT WAS VERY BOSSY AND DIRECT LIKE BOSTON'S OWN MATDAMIN IN GOOD WILL HUNTING SHE BEGINS SOLVING THE UNSOLVABLE PROBLEM NAMELY IF NINE PASSENGERS GETTIN A BOAT WHICH TURNS OUT TO ONLY HAVE EIGHT LIFE JACKETS NOT ONE PER PERSON AS WE HAD BEEN LED TO BELIEVE MAX AND NOW SOME OF THOSE LIFE JACKETS ARE UNREACHABLE IN THE UNDER WATER PART OF THE BOAT HOW MANY PASSENGERS ARE TOTALLY SCREWED I REMEMBER LOOKING OVER AND THERE WAS A SKY WHO LOOKED REALLY PALE HE JUST DIDN'T LOOK LIKE HE WAS DOING VERY WELL AND I ASKED HIM I SAID CAN YOU SWIM WELL AND HE SAID NO I CAN'T AND I JUST GAVE HIM THE LIFE FEST I TOOK IT OFF MY NACK PUT IT ON

ONE PERSON WHO WAS SORT OF WAY WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG YOU PEOPLE OF COURSE WE DDNOT AND SHE LIKE STOOD UP ON THE BOAT AND STARTED WAVING HER ARMS AND TRYING TO GET THE ATTENTION OF A BOAT THAT I DIDN'T REALIZE WAS ALSO QUITE CLOSE THAT WAS LIKE ESC AND ACTUAL RESCUE BOAT JUST WITHIN WAVING DISTANCE IT WAS SO MUCH TALLER THAN U OFF THE WATER LINE AND THERE WAS GUYS ON DECK CUN A LOOKING DOWN

BEABER OBVIOUSLY BEING A MAJOR FIGURE IN EARLY TWITTERER MAYBE IT MAYBE THE MOST POPULAR USERE AT LEAST FOR SOME PERED OF TIME YES THERE WERE YOU KNOW RUMORS THAT TWITTER HAD ENTIRE SERVERS JUST DEDICATED TO SERVING JUSTIN BEABER RELATED TRAFFIC BESIDES BEABER WHAT TWITTER WAS REALLY KNOWN FOR BACK THEN WAS ITS TROLLS THE SIGHT WAS PLAGUED BY USARS HARASSING OTHER USERS PARTICULARLY WOMEN THAT YEAR I CO REPORTED THE STORY ABOUT HOW THE SITS THEN SEE YO DICK COSTALO RUTAMEMBO SAYING QUOTE WE SUCK AT DEALING WITH ABUSE ONTROLLS ON THE PLATFORM AND WE SUCKED AT IT FOR YEARS THAT WAS THE

TRUSTAN SAFETY IT'S A HARD JOB AN JUST KEPT GETTING MORE COMPLICATED THE WAY YOU ALL TELLS A THERE WAS A WILD NEW CASE TO EXAMINED ALMOST EVERY DAY FOREIGN GOVERMEDS IM PERSONATING THEIR ENEM ESE REAL PEOPLE ORGANIZING HORASSMY CAMPAIGNS IT POSSIBLE TEBATES OVER WHAT SHOULD COUNTASS HATESPEECH AND REGULAR MEETINGS OVER WHETHER TO PUT LABELS ON TWEETS THAT DIDN'T QUITE VITALLY THE COMPANY'S RULES WOULD BENEFIT FOR MORE CONTEXT LIKE ABOUT COVET IN TWENTY TWENTY THE BIGGEST CASE YET LANDED ON YUELL'S DESK IT WAS A CASE ABOUT A USER WHO KEPT CAUSING PROBLEMS IND THIS GUIS PHANS WERE EVEN MORE RABID THAN JUST IN BEABERS IT WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THE TRUB THIS IS A COUPLE BUDS INTO THE PANTEMIC TRUMPET TWEETED THAT MALAND BALLATS AND THAT YEAR'S ELECTION WERE GOING TO LEAD A WIDESPREAD FRAUD AND JUST TALAY MY OWN CRES ON THE TABLE I THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY BAT BECAUSE THEY WON'T LEAD THE WEDS RED FRAUD ANYWAY TWITTR'S POLICIES PROHIBITED MISLEADING PEOPLE ABOUT THE VOTING PROCESS THE WAY TRUP WAS DOIN BUT THE COMPANY AD NEVER TAKE AN ACTION AGAINST THE PRESIDENT'S TWEETS BEFORE YOU ELL HAD TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO I DIDN'T SEE A BASIS FOR CHANGING THE POLISY MODIFYING IT WINKING AT IT SQUINTING AND FINDING A VIOLET LIKE THERE THERE WAS NO WAY AROUND IT IT WAS CLEARLY A VIOLATION OF OUR POLICY TRUTHFULLY THERE WAS A LOT OF NERVOUSNESS ABOUT CROSSING THIS LINE FOR THE FIRST TIME TAKING ACTION ON A TWEET FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THE COMPANY DECIDED THAT INSTEAD OF REMOVING THE PRESIDENT'S POST IT WOULD PUT A LABEL UNDER IT A LABEL THAT JUST SAID GET THE FACTS ABOUT MAILAN BALLATS WITHA LING TW A PAGE THAT PUSHED BACK ON TRUBS CLEAVES AT A CERTAIN POINT WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR THAT YES THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AM IT BECAME A QUESTION OF WHO COULD PUSH THE BUTTON ON SOME LEVEL WE PROBABLY UNDERSTAND THAT IN A MOMET LIKE THIS SOMEONE HAS TO TAKE A PHYSICAL ACTION TO TIPE THE WORDS GET THE BACS ABOUT MAILAND BALLATS AND CLICK THE BUTTON TO ATTACH THE LABEL TO THE POST IV TALKED A DOZENS O CONT AT MODERATORS OVER THE YEARS BUT I NEVER TALK TO SOMEWERY TOED MODERATOD THE PRESIDET OF THE UNITED STATES WHEN IT CAME TIME TO TAKE ACTION ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE AT TWITTER HAD THE POWER TO DO IT THE COMPANY A LOCKED DOUN ACCESS AFTER AN INCIDENT WHERE A FORMER CONTRACTOR ON HIS LAST DAY WORKING THERE BRIEFLY DEACTIBATED TRUPS ACCOUNT SHOUTED TO BODY OR DOESECK WHO SAYS IT WAS AN ACCIDENT ALSO TWITTER  JUST INTRODUCED THIS IDEA OF PUTTING LABELS ON MISSINFORMATION A COUPLE WEEKS BEFORE AND SO WAS THIS PERFECT STORM WHERE I IT REQUIRED ELEVATED ACCESS AND KNOWLEDGE OF THIS INCREDIBLY CONVOLUTED SYSTEM FOR APPLYING THESE LABELS AND I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO KNEW HOW TO DO IT AND SO I GOT AN INSTRUCTION FROM MY BOSS THAT SAID ARE I WERE GOING TO DO THIS ALSO BECAUSE THIS IS HOW LIFE GOES YOUELL IN HIS HUSBAND WERE MOVING HOUSES THE DAY AL THIS HAPPENED I EXCUSED MYSELF FROM WRANGLING THE DOG AND THE MOVERS AND THE RELOCATION OF STUFF AND SAT IN THE FRONT SEAT OF THE CAR WITH MI SELPHONE TATHERED TO MY WOUR CLOP TOP I WAS ON A VIDIO CAL WITH SOME OF THE OTHER AN LEADERS AT THE COMPANY WHO WERE MAKING THIS DECISION AND I REMEMBER A COUNT DOWN WHERE I WAS GOING TO PUSHED THE BUTTON THAT WOULD APPLY THE LABEL TO THIS TWEET AT THAT SAME MOMENT TWITTER'S COMMUNICATION STAFF WAS GOING TO ANNOUNCE THE DECISION AND IT FELT VERY IMPORTANT IN THAT MOMENT FOR THE TIMING TO BE EXACTLY JOINED UP FOR SOME REKSN WE COUNTED DOWN I CLICKED THE BUTTON AND THEN I REFRESHED THE PUBLIC VIEW OF THE TWEET AND SAW THE LABEL AND THE COMMUNICATIONS TEAM SAID WE'VE GOT IT FROM HERE AND I SAID OK I HAVE TO GO BACK AND DEAL WITH THE MOVERS NOW AND I HUNG UP THE CALL AND I CLOSED MY LAP TOP AND I CROSSED THE STREET BACK INTO MY APARTMENT IT THEY MADE A MOVY ABOUT TRUMPED TWITTER YOU CAN IMAGIN HOW THEYD SHOOD THIS SCENE WITH THE TWITTER EMPLOYES HUNCHED OVER A CONSOUL AN A CONTROL ROOM HIGH FIVING BUT IN REALITY OF COURSE IS TH OPPOSITE MOST CONTO MODERATORS TRI REALLY HARD NOT TO BRING THEIR IN POLITICAL BELIEFS INTO THE JOB IN A WAY THE LEGITIMACY OF THEWHOLE COMPANY THEY WORK FOR DEPENDS ON IT TRORTLY BEFORE THAT TRUMP TWEAT TWITTER HAD EXPLAINED TIT'S REASONING FOR ADDING LABELS TO MISLEADING INFORMATION WITH A BLOCK POST IN PORTANTLY THE POST WAS SIGNED WITH YOELL'S ME IT SOON AFTER THAT FIRST LABEL SHOWED UP ON TRUPS TWEAET HIS NAME WAS EVERYWHERE I WAKE UP ONE MORNING THE THIRD DAY THAT MY HUSBAND AND I AR IN OUR NEW HOME TO MIG PHONE EXPLODING BECAUSE CALLYAN CONWAY HAS JUST TALKED ABOUT ME ON FOX NEWS AND IS SAID THAT I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CENSORSHIP OF THE PRESIDENT'S ACCOUNT AND AM RESPONSIBLE FOR CENSORSHIP AT TWITTER MORE GENERALLY AND IN THAT MOMENT EVERYTHING EXPLODED THANK YOU AR MU TWE TOTEY TO DEFEND FREE SPEECH O ONE OF THE GRARSDANGERS THE PRESIDENT HELD OUP A COPY OF THE NEW YORK POST WITH ME ON IT IN THE OFAL OFFICE AS HE ANNOUNCED AN EXACUTIVE ORDER RESTRICTING CENSORSHIP BY SELLICAN VALLEY COMPANIES HIS NAME IS YOUELLRO AND HE'S THE ONE THAT SAID THAT E MALAN BALLTING YOU LOOK MAILIN NO FROUD NO FROT RIY AND FOR WEEKS DISCUSSION OF ME AND MY POLITICAL OPINIONS AND MY BELIEFS BECAME A SIMBL OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS ALLEGEDLY WRONG WOITD SELLICAN VALLEYAN WITH DECISIONS THAN COMPANIES HAVE MADE TWITER HAD THO HIGHER SECURITY TO PROJECT YOELL IN HIS HUSBAND IT HAD ALL TAKEN BY SURPRISE HE'D EXPECTED THE CRITICISM BUT NOT THAT HE WOULD BE THE TARGET IN CASES LIKE THIS PEOPLE WOULD USUALLY COME OUF TOR THE SEA YO OR THE COMPANY ITSELF BUT SOON YOU WELL REALIZED THAT WHAT HIS HARASSORS WERE DOING WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE IF YOU MAY COMPANYSBELIEVE THAT THEIR EMPLOYS COULD BE HURT FOR ENFORCING THE RULES THE MIGHT BE MORE RELUCTED TO ENFORCE THAND TWITTERED AN STOPP THEU THEY KEPT PUTTING LABELS ON HIS TWEAT A TRUMP OF COURSE LOST THE ELECTION THO THAT'S PROBABLY NOT OUT HE WOULD DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED AND AFTER THE JANUARY SIX ATTACKS OF THE CAPITAL HE LOST HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT TOO YOU ELL DID NOT PRESS THE BUTTON ON THAT ONE BUT HERE'S A DETAIL ABOUT THAT DAY THAT I LOVE THE ATHER WAS THERE IS A TECHNICAL QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER IT WOULD WORK OR WHETHER TWITTER WOULD CRASH C CAN YOU ACTUALLY BANTOAL TRUPSY ACOUNTER I THE EASYNONOATY WITH THAT MANY FOLLOWERIS HIS ACTUALLY TECHNICALLY VERY COMPLICATED I THIT WHEN YOU SUSPEND SOMEBODY A TWITTER SYSTEMS HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO FOLLOWED THEM AND IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU FALL A TRUMP TWITER HAS TO REMOVE HIM FROM YOUR LIST TO FOLLOWS WHICH SOUNDS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD WHEN WE HAVE TO DO THAT TENS OF MILLIONS OF TIMES IMMEDIATELY WE HAD TO THINK ABOUT LIKE IF WE PUSHED THIS BUTTON IS THE SIGHT IN IT GO DOWN IS IT TURNED OUT THE SLIGHTSTAT UP AN TROUP WAS BAND FOR A WHILE ANYWAY IT WAS SUCH A STRANGE MOMENT WITH THE CLICK OF A MOUSE TWITTER HAD MANAGE SHOULD DO SOMETHING THAT CONGRESS ATTEMPTED TWICE AND FAILED TO PUNNISH DOTTAL TRUMP IN A WAY THAT HAD REAL IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCES FOR HIM TRUMP HEADED OFF TO MAROLAGA YOU ELL GOT PROMOTED HE WAS RUNNING THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT ND THAT'S WHAT ANOTHER MOUTHY RICH GUY STARTED TO COMPLAIN ABOUT ALL THE RULES ON TWITTER THE GUI WAS ELAN MUSK IN APRIL TWENTY TWENTY TWO MUST ANNOUNCE HET ACQUIRED A BIG STAKE IN THE COMPANY A FE IS AFTER THAT HE ANNOUNCE IS INTENPTION TO BY OUTRIGHT AS SOON AS THE NEWSBROKE YOWELLS EMPLOYS STARTED ASKING WHAT A MEN FOR THEM YELON HAD BEEN TWEETING A LOT ABOUT FREE SPEECH AND HIS FEELING THAT TWITTER DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH OF IT HE PUSHEEN A PHOTO OF SIX PEOPLE IN DARK ROBES WITH THE CAPTION SHADOW BAN COUNCIL REVIEWING TWEAT AND TRUTH SOCIAL EXISTS BECAUSE TWITTER CENSORED FREE SPEECH ALSO STUFF LIKE NAXT TEMWHEN TO BY COCOCOLA AND PUT THE COCANE BACK IN AND LET'S MAKE TWITTER MAXIMUM FUN SOME EMPLOYES WORKING IN TRUST IN SAFETY WORRIED THAT MAXIMUM FUN MIGHT MEAN ELON WOULD DISMANTLE THEIR WHOLE OPERATION YOU ALL WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE THOUGH WHAT I TOLD THEM AND WHAT I SINCERELY BELIEVED WAS IT'S TOO SOON TO TELL PEOPLE ARE FREQUENTLY CARICATURE AND VILLANIZED IN THE MEDIA CERTAINLY I WAS AND THAT'S NOT A REFLECTION OF WHO THEY ACTUALLY ARE AND SO DON'T PREJUDGE AT THE SAME TIME YOU WELL KNEW THAT IS MORE CONCERNED EM PLOYS MIGHT BE RIGHT THAT HE WAS ABORT A SHIP THAT MIGHT BE ABOUT TO SINK HE KNEW HE NEEDED TO BE ALERT FOR THE SIDES HIS SOLUTION WAS TO MAKE A LIST TO WRITE DOWN THE RED LINES THAT HE WOULD NOT CROSS NO MATTER WHAT MOST ASA'S JOB WAS TO ENFORSE OTHER PEOPLE'S RULES BUT WITH ELA COMING IN HE WANTED TO WRITE DOWN SOME RULES FOR HIMSELF YOU HAVE TO HAVE WRITTEN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SO THAT WHEN THE MOMENT COMES TO MAKE THAT DECISION YOU JUST FOLLOW THE PRECEDURE THAT YOU HAD LAID OUT BEFORE YOUR WHOLD JOB WAS ABOUT TRYING TO NOT MAKE DECISIONS OUT OF IMPULSE AN EMOTION BUT SERVE BY FOLLOWING A PLAYBOOK AND THAT MEANT THAT BEFORE ELAN TOOK OVER YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO GIVE YOURSELF A PLAYBOOK THAT'S RIGHT IT SO WANTED NOPAD BY HIS DESK AT HIS HOUSE HE WROTE DOWN HIS RED LINES I WILL NOT BREAK THE LAW I WILL NOT LIE FOR HIM I WILL NOT UNDERMYN THE INTEGRITY OF AN ELECTION BY THE WAY IF YOU EVER FIND YOURSELF MAKING A LIST LIKE THIS YOUR JOB IS INSANE THEN YOU WELL WROTE DOWN ONE MORE THIS WAS LIKE A BIG ONE I WILL NOT TATE ARBITRARIER YOU NALATERAL CONTENT MODERATION ACTION ON AND SO IF YOULANT CAME UP YOU JUST AT BANDLESS PERSON YOU WERE CO DO THAT I WAS A LEMIT DIEVERY ONE YOUR TAMESHORYOU THE LISS OF THEY WERE MAKING TO OR TALKED YOU ABOUT THEM WE DED YOU WELS LISTENLS GOT ITS FIRST TEST PRETTY QUICKLY ON THE DATE YOULONT OFFICIALLY TOOK OVER TWITTER IT WAS THE END OF OCTOBER LAWYERS WERE FINALIZING PAPER WORK AND TWITTER STAFF WAS ATTEMPTING TO ENJOY THE AND YOUALL COMPANY HOLLOWIN PARTY THE SCENE WAS SEREAL WERE YOU THERE FOR THE HLOWING PARTY I WAS WERE YOU DRESSED UP I WAS NOT LOTS OF PEOPLE DID DRESS UP THOUGH EMPLOYS BROUGHT THEIR KIDS THERE WERE BALLOONS AND FASE PAINTING I'VE TALKED TO SO MANY PEOPLE WHO WENT TO THIS PARTY EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS ADDED SOME BAZAARE NEW DETAIL SO PEOPLE SAW A GUY A DRESSED AS A SCARECROW WALKING AROUND WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE A HANDLER THEY WONDERED IF IT WAS MUSK IT TURNED OUT TO BE A HIRED PERFORMER AS THE HOLLOWING PARTY HAD STARTED I WAS SITTING IN A CONFERENCE ROOM DOING SOME WORK AND WE STAR HEARING RUMORS THAT NOT ONLY HAS THE DEAL CLOSED BUT ALSO THE COMPANY'S EXECUTIVES HAVE BEEN FIRED AND AT FIRST IT'S UNCONFIRMED I GOT TEXTS FROM A COUPLE OF REPORTERS WHO ASKED ME IS IT TRUE THAT VIGIA HAS BEEN FIRED I SAID NO I JUST SAW HER SHE'S STILL ON LYING AND THE COMPANIES SLIKE SLACK AND GEMAIL LIKE SHE'S OF COURSE NOT LIKE YOUR SOURCES ARE LYING TO YOU AND THEN IT WAS TRUE SUCH AN IMPORTANT LESSON ALWAYS TRUST THE REPORTERS PRETTY SOON AFTERWARD YOU WLL GET SUMMONED OVER TO THE PART OF HEADQUARTERS WHERE ELON IN HIS TEAM HAD SET UP SHOP HE WAS NERVOUS AND I THOUGHT OKE I'M ABOUT TO BE FIRED SO I WALK PAST A NUMBER OF MY EMPLOYSE AND I DON'T LET ON THAT ANY OF THIS AS HAPPENING BECAUSEI DON'T WANT A PANIC THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE THERE WITH THEIR KIDS SIND SO I SMILE AND YOU KNOW MAKE JOKES ABOUT HOLLOWING COSTUMES AND WALK OVER TO THIS OTHER PART OF THE OFFICE WHERE SOMEBODY WHO I GATHER WORKS FOR ELANMASK IN SOME CAPACITY BUT THEY DON'T INTRODUCE THEMSELVES THEY JUST SAY HOW DO I GET ACCESS TO TWITTER'S INTERNAL CONTENT MODERATION SYSTEMS I CANA PAUS AND AND BLANK AN SAY YOU DON'T THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN I EXPLAIN THAT TWITTER IS OPERATING UNDER AN FTISI CONSENT DECREE THAT ACCESS TO INTERNAL SYSTEMS IS REGARDED IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND THAT THERE ARE BOTH LEGAL AND POLICY REASONS WHY WE SIMPLY COULDN'T GRANT ACCESS TO SOMEBODY YOULANS AID EXPLAINS THAT THERE WORRIED ABOUT AN INSIDEER THREAT SOME ONE WHO MIGHT TRY TO SABATASH THE SIGHT ON THEIR WAY OUT YOU ALL TELLS HIM SURE I CAN HELP WITH THAT HE EXPLAINE SOME STEPS THEY CAN TAKE TO PROTECT THE COMPANY AND TO YOU ALL SURPRISE THE AID SAYS O K YOU'RE GONTO TELL THAT TO ELON AND THAT HE LEAVES AND COMES BACK WITH YOULAN MUSK WHO AT THIS POINT I'VE LIKE SEEN ON THE INNER NAT BUT I I HAD NOT MET IN PERSEN AND SO ELON SITS DOWN AND ASKS WELL LET ME SEE OUR TOOLS OUR TOOLS HE OWNS THE COMPANY AT THIS POINT AND SO I SHOW HIM HIS OWN ACCOUNT IN TWITTERS SET OF ENFORCEMENT TOOLS AND I EXPLAINED TO HIM WHAT THE BASIC CAPABILITIES ARE AND THEN I MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO HIM OF WHAT I THINK TWITTER SHOULD DO TO PREVENT INSIDER MISUSE OF TOOLS DURING THE CORPORA TRANSITION YOU ELL ALSO HAD RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE MID TERMS AND THE UP COMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN BRAZIL AND AS I START TO EXPLAIN SOME OF THE RATIONAL RELATED TO THE BRAZILIAN ELECTION YEULON INTERRUPTS ME AND SAYS YES BRAZIL BOLSONARO AND LULA VERY DANGEROUS WE NEED TO PROTECT THAT ANDI WAS FLOORED I CAME INTO THAT CONVERSATION EXPECTING HIM TO FIRE ME AND INSTEAD HE JOMPS AHEAD OF ME TO SAY THAT HE IS SENSITIVE TO THE RISKS OF OFFLINE VIOLENCE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE BRAZILIAN ELECTION AND WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T INTERRUPT TWITTER'S CONTENT MODERATION CAPABILITIES IT WAS LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE YOU'RE THINKING MAYBE I'M ACTUALLY ALIVED WITH THIS PERSON YES AND SO YOU LL STAYED HE WAS SURPRISED IN A GOOD WAY AN TWITTER YOU LOT TALKED ABOUT THE COMPANY AS IF IT SHOULD BARELY HAVE ANY RULES AT ALL BUT IN THAT MOMENT ONE ON ONE YOU ELL THOUGHT HE MIGHT TURN OUT TO BE MORE REASONABLE MAYBE SPENDING SOME TIME INSIDE THE COMPANY WOULD SHOW ELON THE REAL VALUE OF THOSE RULES WHICH IS THAT WITHOUT THE YOUD LOSE YOUR USERS AND YOU LOSE YOUR ADVERTISERS AND YOU ALL FELT LIKE YOU LIK COULD BE SENSIBLE ONE OF HIS FIRST REQUESTS WAS TO RESTORE THE ACCOUNT OF THE BABYLON B A RIGHTWING SATIR SIT BUT YOU WELL EXPLAINED HOW IT HAD BROKEN TWITTERS RULES AND ELAN BACKED OFF I FOUND HIM TO BE FUNNY I FOUND HIM TO BE REASONABLE I FOUND THAT HE RESPONDED WELL TO HAVING EVIDENCE BACK RECOMMENDATIONS BE PUT IN FRONT OF HIM AND I FOR A MOMENT FELT THAT IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE FUR TWITTERS TRUST IN SAFETY WORK TO NOTJUST CONTINUE BUT ALSO TO GET BETTER AFTER THAT THINGS BEGAN TO MOVE REALLY QUICKLY ABOUT A WEEK LATER OU LAN LAID OFF HALF THE STAFF SUDDENLY YOU WELL WAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST RAKING EMPLOYES FROM THE OLD TWITTER WHO WAS STILL WORKING AT THE NEW ONE AND IT SEEMD LIKE EULUNLIKED HIM AFTER SOME TROLLS WENT AFTER YOELL FOR SOME OF HIS OLD TWEEDS YOULETWEATED THAT HE SUPPORTED HIM THE YOU AST MITTERMELECTIONS TOOK PLACE MOSTLY WITHOUT INCIDENT SAME FOR THE ELECTION IN BRAZIL OULAN KEPT PUSHING HIS TEAMS TO MOVE FASTER EVEN AS HE WAS LAYING THEM OFF AT FIRST YOU ALLSO THAT TWITTER STILL HAD ENOUGH CONTENT MODERATORS TO KEEP THE SIGHT SAFE BUT THE CUTS KEPT COMMI ND THE WORK GOT HARDER AND HARDER SOON ELAN ANDVAILE HIS FIRST BIG IDEA FOR MAKING LOTS OF MONEY AND RECOOPING THE FORTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS HE HAD SPENT TO BY THE COMPANY YOELL AN HIS TEAM THOUGHT IT WAS INSANE THE PLAND TO LET ANY OLN GET A BLUE VERIFIED BADGE FOR THEIR PROFILE FOR EIGHT DOLLARS A MONTH THE COMPANY CALLED IT TWITTER BLUE THE RISKS SEEMED OBVIOUS PEOPLE WOULD JUST MAKE NEW ACCOUNTS TO AMPERSONATE BRANDS AND POLITICIANS AND OTHER CELEBRITIES YOELL AN HIS TEAM ROT TO SEVEN PAGED DOCUMENT OUTLINING THE RISKS BUT THE BAD IS WENT ON SAIL ANYWAY AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AND PERSONATOR STARTED BUYING THEM AND REKIN HAVIT IT MAY BE THE MOST FAMOUS CASE SOME ONE IN PERSONATED THE DRUGMAKER ELI LILY AND SAID THAT INSOLENT WOULD NOW BE FREE THE REAL ELA LILY'S STOCK PRICE DROP MORE THAN FIVE PER CENT I WAS A VIVID ILLUSTRATION OF WHIT COMPANIES LIKE TWITTER MAKE RULES IN THE FIRST PLACE IMPERSONATORS WERE SUDDENLY ALL OVER THE SIHTE AND SO O KA WE HAVE TO BAND THEM BUT SOMEBODY HAS TO REVIEUW THEM WE CAN'T JUST LIKE BAN EVERY ONE AND SO YOU DO THAT WITH CONTENT MODERATORS AND WE HAD INSTRUCTIONS TO FIRE MORE OF OUR CONTRACT CONTENT MODERATION STAFF TO COT COSTS ALL THIS SAME AS REALLY SELF EVIDENT TO ME AND I THINK IT WOULD HAVE SEE HIMSELF EVIDENT EVEN BEFORE YOU LODGED THIS UM WHAT WHAT WAS ELAN TO TAKE ON THIS ACCOUN DOD YOU RESPOND TO YOU RAISING THESE CONCERNS DO IT ANYWAY AND THAT WAS A BREAKING POINT FOR ME WE REACHED OUT TO TWITTER FOR COMMENT BUT DIDN'T HERBACK REPORTERS HAVE SOMETIMES GOT AND AUDIMATED PUPIMOGES BUT I DIDN'T EVEN GET THAT YOELL HAD SPENT A LONG TIME GAMING OUT CENAREAS FOR WHAT MIGHT MAKE HIM LEAVE TWITTER HE MADE THAT WHOLE LIST HE WOULDN'T BREAK THE LAW FOR ELAN HE WOULDN'T UNDERMINE AN ELECTION BUT ULTIMATELY WHAT GOT TO HIM WAS SOMETHING HE DIDN'T FORESEE IT WASN'T ON THE LIST IT WAS SOMETHING MORE PERSONAL HE KNEW THIS BIZAAR PLAN WOULDN'T JUST MAKE PEOPLE WHOSE TRUST IN TWITTER THEY WOULD LOOSE TRUST IN HIM BEHIND ELAN MUSK I WAS TE MOST PROMMINENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMPANY PERIOD AND I BECAME AWARE THAT WHEN TWITTER BLUE TURNED INTO THE PREDICTABLE HOT MESS THAT IT WAS THAT PEOPLE WOULD ASK WHY DIDN'T THE TRUST IN SAFETY TEAM SEE THIS COMING YOELL WIRE YOU SO BAD AT YOUR JOB THE DAY AFTER THE LAUNCH YOELL AN ELON GOT ON THE PHONE ELAN THOUGHT THE PROBLEM COULD BE FIXED IF APPLE WOULD JUST HAND OVER ALL THE CREDIT CARD INFORMATION OF THE PEOPLE DOING THE IMPERSONATIONS YOELL HAD TO EXPLAIN THE APPLE WOULD NEVER DO THAT HE ALSO ASKED ELAN TO SLOW DOWN THE ROLL OUT OF BLUE SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TIME TO HIRE AND TRAIN MORE CONTENT MODERATORS TO LOOK FOR IN PERSONATORS ELAN DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THAT WOUD TAKE LONGER THAN A DAY I GOT OFF THAT PHOME CALL AND THOUGHT I CAN'T SOLVE THIS PROBLEM I WILL SPEND THE REST OF MY TIME AT THIS COMPANY TRYING TO BAIL OUT A SHIP THAT MIGHT SINK MORE SLOWLY BECAUSE I'M THERE BAILING IT OUT BUT I DON'T WANT O SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE BAILING OUT A SINKING SHIP YOELL HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO LEAVE HE CALLED A

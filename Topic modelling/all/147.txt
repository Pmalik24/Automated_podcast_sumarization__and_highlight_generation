RUSELL AT THAT TIME CONSIDERING THAT RUSSELL BRAN BY HIS OWN ADMISSION IN ALL OF HIS WRITINGS AND IN ALL OF HIS STATEMENTS HAS BASICALLY ADMITTED TO BEING A SECT ATTICT AND INCREDIBLY PROMISCUOUS AND A PERSON WHI WOULD BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE ENGAGED IN INCREDIBLY VILE BEHAVIOR DURING THAT ENTIRE PERIOD AND THEN RUSSELLBRAND HAS REMADE HIMSELF AND IN THE PERIOD WRIVE KNOWN RUSSELL WHICH IS REALY THE PAS THRE OR FOR YEARS RUSSELL HAS BEEN A PERSON WHO IS SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING MEANINGFUL HE IS SETTLED DOWN OVISY HE'S MARRIED YES KIDS HE'S A PERSON WHO'S BEEN TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER A GOOD LIFE NOW

THAT RUSSELBRAN TODAY IS A GOOD PERSON NOW IS A POSSIBLE THAT YOU'R MISTAKEN ABOUT PEOPLE YOU THINK YOU KNOW SURE THAT'S POSSIBLE TO BUT HERE IS MY PROBLEM WITH THIS PARTICULAR ATTACK ON RUSSELL BRAND FROM THE MEDIA MY PROMISE THE TIMEMAN DURING THE TIME THAT RUSSELBRAN WAS PRETTY FLAGRANTLY AND OBVIOUSLY NOT ONLY PROMISCUOUS BUT INCREDIBLY VILE IN THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT HE SAID PUBLICLY ABOUT SEX AABOUT WOMEN AND ALL THE REST OF THE SORT OF SUFF THE MEDIA WORK CHAMPIONING HIM HE WAS A HERO OF THE LEFT AT THIS TIME WHEN HE WAS ENGAGED IN THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOR HE WAS HE WAS TREATED AS SOME SORT OF PERSON TO EMULY AT THIS TIME HE WAS NOT ONLY ON B BESIS ON M T V WHO'S BEING TREATED AS A PUBLIC CELEBRITY WHILE HE WAS ENGAGING THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOR HE WAS THE IMPISH DEVIL WHO IS WHO IS HAVING SEX OF AS MANY WOMEN AS WHOMLY POSSIBLE IN DOING INTEN MASTRUGS NOW TEN YEARS LATER WILL RUSSELL BRAN HAS FIXED HIS LIFE IN IS TRYING TO MAKE A BETTER LIFE FOR HIMSELF NOW HE GETS IT WITH A FULL SCALE SUNDAY TIMES EXPOSE ABOUT ALL OF THESE WOMEN NOW WERE GOG TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THE ALLIGATIONS WITH WHICH RUSSELL HAS BEEN HIT HOR RUSSELL HAS DENIED ALL F THE ALLIGATIONS AND AGAIN IN EVERY SITUATION ARE TIGUE ABOUT LIKE A TEN YEAR FIFTEEN TWENTY YEAR AGO SITUATION IT IS AT HE SAID SHE SAID THERESJIS NO WA TO VERIFY ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WHETHER SOMEBODY IS TELLING THE TRUTH OR WHETHER THEY ARE NOT ABSENT SOME SORT OF D AN A EVIDENCE AND EVEN D'ANA EVIDENCE ISN'G IN A FULLY EXPLAIN WHAT EXACTLY HAPPEND IF A MAN IN A WOMEN ARE IN A ROOM TOGETHER BECAUSE CONSENT OR NON CONSENDS IS A MATTER OF BEHAVIOR IN THE MOMENT ITIS NOT SOMETHING CAN BE EVIDENCE BY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE TYPICALLY MUST YOURE TALKING ABOUT GOD FORBID SOME SORT OF LIKE FUL AN MUROUS REEP OR SOMETHING IN THIS PARTICULAR GIS WERE YOU HAVES HY BUNCH OF STORIES WERE WOMEN SE JASTAD THE TIME THEN WEREN'T HAPPY OR THER WOEN'T HAPPY AFTERWARD THERE'S ONE ALLEGATION PARTICULAR THAT TEEMS PRETTY SERIOUSLY THE RUSSELL HAS SAID THAT HE IS GOING TO ADDRASS BEFORE I GET TO THE ACTUAL ALLEGATIONS THE TIME INE HERE T IS THAT RUSSELL WHENS UN HIS SWIN AND HE PUT OUT E PRETTY LENTH HE STEEPEMEN TALKING ABOUT WHAT HE SAR COMING BECAUSE APPARENTLY BUT THE SUNDAY TIMES IN CHANNEL FOR WERE GOING AROUND AND FANE DOZENS OF WOMEN TO TALK TO ANDER IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR TO HIM THAT THEY WERE GOING TO WANCH THE STORY AT HIM HEREIT IS WHAT RUSSELL HAD TO SEE JUST BEFORE THE STORY LAUNCHED HALA THERE YOU AWAKENING ONDERS NOW THIS ISN'T THE USUAL TYPE OF VIDIO WE MAKE ON THIS CHANNEL WHERE WE CRITIQUE ATTACK AND UNDERMINE THE NEWS IN ALL ITS CORRUPTION BECAUSE IN THIS STORY I AM THE NEWS I'VE RECEIVED TOO EXTREMELY DISSTURBING LETTERS OR A LETTER AND AN EMOU ONE FROM A MAINSTRY MEDIO T VE COMPANY ONE FROM A NEWSPAPER LISTING A LITANY OF EXTREMELY AGREGIOUS AND AGGRESSIVE ATTACKS AS WELL AS SOME PRETTY STUPID STUFFS LIKE ER MY COMMUNIFESTIVALES SHOULD BE STORP THAT I SHOULDN'T BE A BORTER ATTACK MAINSTRY MEDIA NARRATIVES ON THIS CHANNEL BUT AMIDST THIS LITANY OF ASTONISHING RATHER BEROCK ATTACKS ARE SOME VERY SERIOUS ALLIGATIONS THAT I ABSOLUTELY REFUTE THESE ALLEGATIONS PERTAINED TO THE TIME WHEN I WAS WORKING IN THE MANSTRUM WHEN I WAS IN THE NEWSPAPERS ALL THE TIME WHEN I E WAS IN THE MOVIES N AS I'VE WRITTEN ABOUT EXTENSIVELY IN MY BOOKS I WAS VERY VERY PROMISCOUS NOW DURING THAT TIME OF PROMISCUITY THE RELATIONSHIPS I HAD WERE ABSOLUTELY ALWAYS CONSENTIAL I WAS ALWAYS TRANSPARENT ABOUT THAT THEN ALMOST TOO TRANSPARENT AND ON BEING TRANSPARENT ABOUT IT NOW AS WELL AND TO SEE THAT TRANSPARENCY MATASTESIZED INTO SOMETHING CRIMINAL THAT I ABSOLUTELY DENY MAKES ME QUESTION IS THERE ANOTHER A GENDERAT PLAY PARTICULARLY WHEN WE'VE SEEN COLD AND  MEDIOR ATTACKS BEFORE LIKE WITH JO ROGAN WHEN HE DARED TO TAKE A MEDICINE THAT THE MAINSTRY MEDED IN APPROVE OF AND WE SAW A SPATE OF HEADLINES FROM MEDIA OUTLETS ACROSS THE WORLD USING THE SAME LANGUAGE I'M AWARE THAT YOU GUISES HAVE BEEN SAYING IN THE COMMENTS FOR A WHILE WATCH OUT RUSSELL THERE COMING FOR YOU YO AGAIN TOO CLOSE THE TRUTH RUSSELL BRAN DID NOT KILL HIMSELF I KNOW THAT YEAR AGO THERE WAS A SPATE OF ARCLES RUSELL BRANS OF CONSPIRACY FERIS RUSSELL BRAN'S RI WING I'M AWARE OF NEWS MEDIUM MAKING PHONE CAL SENDING LETTERS THAT PEOPLE I KNOW FOR AGES AND AGES IT'S BEING CLEAR TO ME OR AT LEAST IT FEELS TO ME TIKE THERE'S A SERIOUS AND CONCERTED A GENDER TO CONTROL THESE KIND OF SPACES AND THESE KIND OF VOICES AND I'M IN MY VOICE ALONG WITHIAL VOICE I DON'T MIND THEM USING MY BOOKS AND MY STAND UP TO TALK ABOUT MY PROMISCUOUS CONSENSIAL CONDUCT IN THE PAST WHY SERIOUSLY REFU ARE THESE VERY VERY SERIOUS CRIMINAL ALLIGATIONS ALSO IS WORAVE MENTIONING THAT THERE ARE WITNESCES WHOSE EVIDENCE DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS THE NARRATIVES THAT THESE TOO MAINSTRY MEDIO OUTLETS ARE TRYING TO CONSTRUCT APPARENTLY IN WHAT SEEMS THE ME TO BE A CO ORDERNIGHT IT ATTACK NOW OUGHT I WENE TO GAN FOR THIF ANY FIOUT BECAUSE OF THE THEORIOST NIGHT A AL THEATIGATION BUTI FEEL LIKE ON BEING ATTACK AND PLAINLY THATT WORKING VERY CLIVELY TIGTHASO IS HE RIGHT ABOUT THE TIMING IS YOU RGHT ABOUT THE TIMING THAT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS HERE OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE AGAIN ALL OF THESE ALLIGATIONS SOME OF THEM ARE NOT CRIMINAL SOME OF THEM ARE VERY VERY CRIMINAL AND THERE IS NO STATURE OF LIMITATIONS ON RAPER SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM OR PRETTY MUCH ANYWHERE ELSE IN WES WHICH MEANS THAT THEORETICALLY THE POLICE COULD STILL BRING CHARGES AGAINST HIM IF IN FACT THE ALLIGATIONS AUR TRUE OR IF THERE'S PROOF OF THE ALLIGATIONS BUT THE REAL QUESTION HERE THAT I HAVE AGAIN 'LL GET TO THE ALLIGATIONS THEMSELVES IN JUST ONE SECOND THE REAL QUESTION I HAVE HERE IS WHY THE SUDDEN INTEREST BY THE MEDIA IN ALL THESE STORIES NOW MEANING ALL THESE STORIES BEEN FLOATING AROUND FOR FIFTEEN TEN YEARS OVER A DECKAT AND ONLY NOW DO THEY SEE FIT TACTUALLY TRACK DOWN ALL TE WOMEN WHO SLEPT WITH RUSSELL BRAND AND TRY TO FIND SOME WHO'LL MAKE ALLIGATIONS OR WHO BELIEVE THAT THAT THEY WERE VICTIMS OF RAPE OR SEXUAL ASSAULT FROR MUSSELE BRAN AND ALL I CAN IMAGINE YERE IS THAT RUSSELL BRAN CROSSED A PARTICULAR POLITICAL LINE THAT IF YEU'D STILL BEN ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE LINE HE MEDIA DEFINITELY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN GOING AFTER HIM BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO  YOU DUT LORN ABOT THE MOTIVATIONS WHAT EXACTLY CHANGED IN THE SAME WAY THAT NOTHING CHANGED ABOUT JO ROGAN FROM POINT AIHE TO POINT BE EXCEPT HIS POLITICAL VIEWPOINT IN THE SAME WAY THAT NOTHING CHANGED REALLY ABOUT DONAL TRUM BETWEEN POINT AHT AND POINT BE EXCEPT HIS POLITICAL VIEWPOINT IN THE SAME WAY THAT NOTHING HAS CHANGED HERE ABOUT RUSSELL BRAN FROM POINT EIGHTOPOINT BE ACCEPT HIS POLITICAL VIEWPOINT YOU WONDER ABOUT THE TIMING WHEN HE WAS ENGAGED IN ALL THIS BEHAVIOR WHEN IT OUD HAV BEEN MOST PLAUSIBLE THAT HE ENGAGED IN THE SORT O BEHAVIOUR ALLEGED THE MED YOU ARE NOT ONLY UNINTERESTED THEY WERE PAYING HIM TEN YEARS LATER WHEN RUSELL HAS E'SN'T BY THE WAY NOT A RIGHT WINGER WHEN RUSSELL IS JUST ECIDED THAT HE IS NOT IN FAVORABAE LOT OF SOR LEFT WINGED NARRATIVES RANGING FROM COVID TO TO WOKENESS WHEN THAT HAPPENS SUDDENLY YOU HAVE A COORDINATED ATTACK A COORDINATED INVESTIGATIOM TO THE SUNDAY TIMES AND THE AND THE TALEMAN AND THE CHANNEL FOR NEWS IN BRITTON I FIND THE TIMING AT LEAST SOMEWHAT SUSPICIONU SAY SOMEWHOT I MEAN A LOT SUSPICIONS WILL GET TO THE ALLEGATIONS IN JUST MOMENT BECAUSE SOME OF THEM AGAIT OUR PRETTY QUESTION WILL ON THEIR FACES ONE ALLEGATION PARTICULAATS VERY SERIOUS AND THEN THERE SOME THETR PRETT QUESTIONWILE ON

HE HAD CONSENTUAL SEX WITH ANOTHER PERSON BUT IT DOES GO TO CHARACTER THERE WOMEN WERE NOW COMING OUT SAYING THAT THEY WERE CONTACTED BY THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH  E THERRE OR THE SUNDAY TIMES RATHER THAT THEY WERE CONTACTED BY CHANNEL FOR AND THAT THEY JUST WERE NOT COVERED BECAUS THEY DIDN'T TELL THE STORY THE MEDIA WANTED THEM TO TO TO TELL HERE'S ONE WOMEN EXPLAINING THAT SHE HAD  CONSENTUAL SEX WITH BRAN AND WAS REACHED OUT TO BY THE MEDIA I WAS CONTACTED INTI BYTION ES I REGATI A PIT I MATE ABOUT SA SAPETY AN A WEE HAND THAT WE SAD TOGETHER THE VIDIAIS KIND OF IRO I SOME MI PAY SOMEWHERE IF HE WENTED A SEE N TAND THAT SAN SOMEBODY WAS AS MAS IF HE WILL BE AWAR MISTER BRAND THEY WATAT E'S MY STORY BECAUS IT DIDN'T FIT THE NARRATIVE FOR THAT DOCUMEN TRY BECAUSE HE WASN'T AN CUL TO ME WE

DISPATCTHES FROM CHANNEL FOR AND I I HAVE TO ADMIT IT'S A LITTLEBUT WEIRD THAT ONE OFTHETHINGS AT THEY DO HERE AS THEY SAY THAT THAT NONE OF THE WOMEN WERE WILLING TO COME ON CAMERA TO TALK ABOUT THE ACTUAL ALLEGATIONS INSTEAD THEY HAVE ACTRESSES PLAYING THE WOMEN READING THEIR TACS WICH JUST CANNOS STRANGE JUST FROM A MEDIA PROSPECTIVE TYPICALLY IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A REPORTER YOUR TALKING HAD READ THE ACTUAL WORDS I GET THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAN HAVING ACTRESS PLAY THE WOMAN AND INFUSING THE THE LINES WITH EMOTIONTEMEN THA THAT THAT'S AT'S A STRANGE MOVE JUST FROM A PRODUCTION STANDPOINT TO ME ANYWAY HERE ARE SOME OF THE THE QUOTES FROM DISPATCHES I FIND AND SOMEBODY BELS WHAT I WAS REBOTING AND I WAS SAID THAT'S PEGOTING RUSCLE BRANT BIN  SEX A FOUNDA I WAS LIE O MY GOD HE WRATE TO ME JEL IES T NOTY ONIN FOR TRAING BY ACGRIS WHEN MY RAT HAPPENS IS OUT WAY AND HE HAPPEN TO CALL ME AND SAY I'VE HAD A REALLY BY DAY PLEASE COME OVER AN I AT FIRST I SAID NO MY GOING FAY AND HE'S LIKE

ON UNN CAN I KNOWWHAT HE WANTED MEAN THAT POINT AGEYS A LOT OF THESE ALLIGATIONS TOWNTALOLIKE FOR EXAMPLE THO COBY BRINE TALLIGATIONS REMBER COBY BRINE S ALLIGATIONS LIKE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO THEI'R ALLIGATIONS THAT HE WAS AT A HOTEL AND CHOLORADO AND A WOMAN CAME UP TO HIS ROOM IT LIKE THREE A M AND THEN AS IT TURNS OUT MOST LIKELY SHAD CONTENTUAL SEX ITHEM THAN SHE CLAIMED SHE WAS RAPE IN SOME OF THESE CASES WERE ITS LIKE WOMEN GOING TO MEN'S ROOMS AT TWO A M THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE MAN GETS TO PERTISPATAN RAPE IT DOES MEAN THE OUTH TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNTS ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN YOU HEAR A HE SAID SHE SAID STORY IND THE SORT OF BELIEVE ALL WOMEN MEAM HAS ALWAYSBEEN RIDICULOUS IT'S NO DIFVEREN THING BELIEVE ALL MEN IN SPECIALY RIDICULOUS WHENYOU CAN MEN TO FIND THE WORDS WOMEN OR MEN BUT AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE SORTS OF STORIES THIS IS THE PROBLEM IN HERILY WITH NOT GOING FORWITH SAY A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION AT THE TIME AND ALLIGATION IS MADE WHEN YOU COME FORWARD TEN YEARS LATER OF COURSE THE STORY IS GING TO GET ANALYZED AND THAT'S NOT BEING MEAN TO THE WOMAN OR CRUEL TO THE WOMAN IT'S IF WERE TRYING TO GET AT THE TRUTH OF A THING THAT EITHER HAPPENED OR DIDN'T HAPPEN OU HAVE THE LOOK T THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE ACTURAL ALLIGATIONS GARIN GETS O MORE ON TESE ALLIGATIONS IN JUST ONE MOMENT FIRST DID YOU KNOW THAT POOR SLEEP CAN CAUSE WAITGAIN MOOD ISSUES POOR MENTAL HEALTH AND LOWER PRODECTIVITY I KNOW THAT BECAUSE OM I'VE EXPERIENCED SOME OF THOSE THINGS CONSIDERING I YOU KNOW THE KID SID EVERYTHING SLEEP IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR MENTAL AN PHYSICAL HEALTH

USE CODE BEN FRUP TO FORTY PER CENT OFF O CASE SO NOUNCE THE ACTUAL ALLIGATIONS VERY LONG STORY FROM AS I SAY THE SUNDAY TIMES IN THE YUK ND THEY SAY FOUR WOMEN HAVE ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULTS BETWEEN TWENTY O SECTS AND TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN HE AS A PRESENTOR FOR B B S RADIO TO AND CHANNEL FOR AND THEN IN ACTOR AND HOLLY WOOD FILMS OTHERS HAVE MADE A RANGE OF ACCUSATIONS ABOUT BRAND'S CONTROLLING ABUSIVE AND PREDATORY BEHAVIOR BRAN DENIED THE ALLIGATIONS AND SET ALL OF HIS RELATIONSHIPS HAVE BEEN CONSENSUAL IT'S SO WE AN GO THROUGH SOME OF TESE ALLIGATIONS BECAUSE AGAIN THERE IS THIS WEIRD TENDENCY WHEN WHEN ALLIGATIONS LIKE THIS COME OUT N YOU SEE THEM ALSO ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE ARMY HAMMER WRITE THE ACTOR ARMY HAMMER ALL THESE ALLIGATIONS WILL COME OUT OFTHE WOOD WORK ACCUSING ARMY HAMMER OF HAVE ENGAGED IN RAPE OR SEXUAL ASSAULT AND TURNS OUT T PERSONS BEEN IN LIKE A LONG STANDING SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP WI THE PERSON WHERE THEY HAD SEX THE PERSON BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SOMEHOW BELIEVE THAT IN THE MIDDLE WAS THE RAPE IN MAYBE THAT'S TRUE MAYBE THAT'S NOT BUT IT GOES TO CREDIBILITY IF YOU STAYD WITH THE GUY IF YOU WERE THE GI BEFORE AND YOU STATED WITH THE GUY AFTER THERE'ARE COUPLE OF SITUATIONS THAT ARE LIKED US AND THEN THERE ARE CERTAIN SITUATIONS WHERE THE'RE NOT AGAINST THE LAW IT'S JUST THE BRAND IS SUPPOSED TO BE CREEPING WHICH HE HAS AD MITTED TO BEING BETWEEN LIKE THIS EN TIRE PERIOD THAT HE WAS A CREEP WITH WOMEN SO FOR EXAMPLE THE FIRST STORY HERE IS QUOTE AS HER TAXY APPROACHED TO RUSTLE BRAN'S HOME ALCE REMEMBERS THE DRIVER BEGGING HER NOT TO GO INSIDE RECOGNIZING THE DESTINATION HE'D STIDED TASK QUESTIONS ALICE ADMITTED SHE WAS SIXTEEN IN STILL IN SCHOOL SHE SAYS THE DRIVER REPPLIED HIS DAUGHTER WAS THE SAME AGE AND AND TREATED ALICE PLEASE HIM ASKNG YOU NOT GOING THERE YOU COULD BE MY LITTLE GIRL I WOULD WANT SOME ONE TO DO THIS FOR HER HE OFFERED TO TAKE HER HOME WITHOUT CHARGE BUT ALICIN SISTED SHE WAS FINE HE HAD JUST A SAD LOOK IN HIS EY SHE RECALLED ALICE WHOSE NAME WE HAVE CHANGED TO PROTECTOR IDENTITYG NOW REALIZED AS SHE WASN'T FIME DURING A RELATIONSHIP THET LASTER FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS WHEN BRAND WAS A B B SE RADYA PRESENTER SHE SAYS HE REFERRED TO HER AS THE CHILD AND ELEGES HE BECAME INCREASINGLY CONTROLLING ANDTHEN EMOTIONALLY INSEXUALLY ABUSIVE SO AT THIS TIME BRAND WAS THIRTY AND SHE WAS APPARENTLY SIXTEEN CAN NOW IN THE UNITED STATES CRIME IN THE UK NOT CRIME THE AGE OF CONSENT IN THE UK IS SIXTEEN AND APPARENTLY BRAND ASCERTAINED THET SHE AS SIXTEEN BY ASKING HER AND CHECKING WHICH MEANS SCUZZID SCUM BAGGY BEHAVIOR SHORE CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR NOW IF YOU'RE AGAIN IN THE UKE AND THE AGE OF CONSENT CHANGES FROM STATES OUT PREFOR THE AGE OF CONSENT BE EIGHTEEN BUT IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THAT THEN THAT'S WHAT IT IS ACCORDING TO THE TIMES BRAND MADE HIS NAME IN COMMENYING THE EARLY TO THOUSANS AND ALSO ACHIEVED THE STATUS OF LONDON'S MOST LECIVIOUS LATHARIO AFTER H GAVE UP DRUGS INTO TDOSN'T TOO BRAND FILLED THAT VOOD WITH SEX IN SHE THASN'T FIVE YOE RECEIVED TREATMENT FOR SEXODICTION AT A CLINIC IN THE US HIS WOMANIZING WAYS HE ONCE HAD HE COULD SLEEP WITH EIGHTY WOMEN IN MONTH SOM CROWN SHAGGER OF THE YEAR BY THE SON THREE TIMES HAVE RELATIONSHIPS OS SOME THE WORLD'S MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN INCLUDING CAPE LOSS AND MARY POP STARKATY PARRY IN  TWENTY TEN NOW AGAIN THIS GOES BACK TO WHAT I SAYING BEFORE WHEN HE AS ENGAGED IN THIS INCREDIBLY PROMISCUOUS BEHAVIOR THE MEDIA WERE CHAMPIONING HIM AND TALKING ABOUT WHAT A WONDERFUL GUY HE WAS AN THEARE TALKING ABOUT HOW HE WAS JUST THIS AGAIN SORT OF ELVISH IMBISH FIGURE ON THE WORLD STAGE SCREWING AS MANY WOMEN IS HUMANLY POSSIBLE NOW THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE AN AMAZING TIME TO CHECK INTO WHETHER ANY OF THOSE WOMEN WERE HAPPY WITH THE SITUATION OR WETHER ALL OF THEM WERE OR THE SOME OF THEM WORN'T DID THEY DO SO AT THE TIME NOW BECAUSE HE WAS BUSY GETTING PAID BY ALL THESE SAME PEOPLE ONLY TEN YEARS LATER WHEN HE HAS FLIPED IN TERMS OF HIS PERSONAL LIFE AND IN TERMS OF THE VALUES SHE IS POUSES NOW NOW IT'S WORTH WHILE FOR THEM TO COME AFTER HIM AND IT'S THE MEDIAMOTIVATION HERE IS PART OF THE STORY AN IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO WITHOUT IT AD THEN THEY GO ON ABOUT ALICE ANDA AND SHE IN IT GETS VERY GRAF A CONTALKS ABOUT HOW SHE WAS AVERSION AND HW HE AS TURN ON BY THIS AGAIN IS ANYTHING HERE ACTUALLY IN ACCUSATION OF CRIMINALITY NOW IT'S IT IT'S APPARENTLY AN ACCUSATION OF OF GROSSTNESS TOWARD THE END OF THE RELATIONSHIP ALICE SAYS THE BRAN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HER NOW THIS IS AN ACCUSATION OF CRIMINALITY ORIGHT SHE SHE SAYS THAT EFFECTIVELY HE FORCED HER INTO ORAL SEX ANDA SHE HAD TO PUNCH HIM TO GET HIM OFF OF HER AND ALL OF THIS THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM WHICH HIS HAS QUOTE THE RELATIONSHIP ANDED WHEN BRAND INVITED HER OVER ONE DAY AND SHE ARRIVED TO FIND ANOTHER WOMAN IN HIS BED I WAS SO AN GR A SAID THEN WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO ME THIS IS SO HUMILIATING ALICE HAS DECIDE TO SPEAK OUT NOW BECAUSE SHE BELIEFE SHE WAS TOO YOUNG TO BE ABLE TO CONSENT TO A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEN AS ALT MAN AND THE LAW SHOULD BE CHANGED PROTECT THOSE UNDER EIGHTIN I AGREE THE LAW SHOULD BE CHANGED PRETECT THOSE UNDER EIGHTEEN BUT THE ALLIGATION OF I LEGAL BEHAVIOR INCLUDING FORCIBLE SECUAL ASSAULTS HERE RIGHT WOULDN'T THAT LIKE IF THAT'S A CRIMINAL ASSAULT SHOULDN'T SHE HAVE REPORTEF THAT'S A POLICE OR SHOULN'T SEUREPORT IT NOW YOU'LL NOTICE THA THESE ARE NOT CRIINAL CHARGES THE POLICE APPARENTLY ARE NOW SOLICITING THE WOMEN TO SEE IF THEY WANT TO COME FORWARD AND DO CRIMINAL CHARGES SO FAR NONE OF RESPONDED AS FAR AS I'M AWARE THEN THERE'S TALK ABOUT HOW WHEN BRAN WAS E CHANNEL FOR PRESENTER THERE ARE BASICALLY PEOPLE WERE SENT IN OF THE CROWD TO PIMP FOR HIM TO GO PICK UP WOMEN AND BRING H BRING THE BACK STAGE SAI THAT DA HO 'D HAVE SEX WITH THEM NOW LEME JUST POINT OUT THAT THIS IS  COMMON PRACTICE IN HOLLIWOOD IT'S DISGUSTING IT'S BEEN VILE FOR EVER ONLY PEOPLE LIKE MEEVEN POINTING IT OUT WERE CONSIDERED PRUDES FOR DOING SO IT'S TOTALLY FINE IN HOLLY WOUD UP UNTIL THE POINT IT'S NOT THIT'S PART OF THE CHANGING STANDARD HERE PRETTY AMAZING WY THEY ALL KNEW I MEAN IF THIS WAS THE BAD BEHAVIOR WHY THEIRE PORT I'VE QUESTION WHY IS THIS NEWS RELEVANT THAT HE WAS ALATHARIO WHO WAS SENDING PEOPLE INTO THE CROWD OF BB C SHOWS TO PICK UP WOMEN I'M JUST WONDERINGLY WHAT ABILL CLINTON DID THE SAME THING TO CAN PRESENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE MEDIA DISMISSED IT I'M JUST WONDERING WHY EXACTLY THIS IS RELEVANT NOW IT WOUOD BEEN RELEVAN THEN BUT THE PROBLEM IS THEYARE ON THE SIDE OF THOSE VALUES THEY'RE ON THE SIDE OF THOSE VALUES WHICH AS WHY THEY PROTECTED IT THEN IF IT WAS BAD THEN IF I'S BAD NOW WAS BAD THEN APPARENTLY BUT ACCORING THEM WASN'T BAD THEN SO THAT THIS IS WHY THE'RE TRYING TO COME UP WITH WITH NEW ALLIGATIONS THE NEW ALLIGATIONS BEING ACTUAL RAPE OR SEXUAL ASSAULT AND RUSTLL IS DENYING ALL THIS ALLIGATIONS AND WE HAVE GET SEAT THE PROOF BUT PY THE PROBLEM WITH A SITUATION WHICH YOUAVE UNNAMED WOMEN MAKING ALLIGATIONS AND THESE UNNAMED WOMEN ARE OT MAKINGTEM CRIMINALLY IS THAT THERE IS NO WAY TOO A JUDICATE THE TRUTH OR FALSITY OF THE STATEMENTS NOW THE BURDEN IS SUPPOSED BE ON RUSTLE BROUND TO DISPROOV THAT THIS THING HAPPEN WHICH JUST TYPICALLY NOT THE WAY THEIR WORK TYPICAL YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BURDEN OF PROOF THAT SHOWS THAT THE THING DID HAPPEN I WAVE SEEN TO MANY  SITUATIONS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS OF ACCUSATIONS THAT TURN OUT TO BE EITHER EXAGGERATED OR NOT TROF BRAGK HAVENOT BEING MOST OBVIOUS EXAMPLE THAT COMES TO MINE IN MY OPINION THE EGN CARREL STORY IS NOT CREDIBLE RED THERE THERE JUST PLENTY OF THESE ALLIGATIONS THA ARE OUT THERE ABOUT FAMOUS MEN WHO'VE CROSSED A PARTICULAR LINE AND

ALIGATION WHICH FRANKLY TOWNS LIKE SHE HAS SUPPORTING EVIDENCE AND WILL EE WHAT COMES UP THE THING THAT I FIND PUSZLING AND BEWILDERING IS THE MEDIA'S DECISION TO GO WHOLE HOG ON THIS STORY AFTER

BEEN SCOFFED AT N LAUGHED UP ON TH MEDIO FOR LITERALLY DECATES AND IT TURNS OUT THE GRIS PROTECTION FOR BOTH WOMEN AND MEN IS THOSE SEXUAL MORRIES AND ONLY WHEN RUSSELL BRAND HAS REEMBRACED THOSE ARE THE MEDIA COMING AFTER HIM FULLSKILL AN HO'S ENGAGED IN TRANSGRESSION OF THE SECTUAL MORRES HE WAS A HERO TO THE WORLD THE MINUTE THAT HE SWITCHES ALL THE SUDDEN THE MEDIA ARE AFTER HIM TBECAUSE THIS IS ONE O THE THINGS THE MEDIAO LOVE TO DO THEI'RE FAVORITE CHARGE IS HYPOCRISY TH THE THING THAT THEY CONSIDER TO BE A CRIME IN MANY CASES THEY DON'T ACTOUL CONSIDERD BE A CRIME SO MUCH OF THE BEHAVIOR THEY DISCUSSUR THEY'RE TOTALLY FINE WITH IT IS WHEN THE PERSON ADVOCATES AE DIFFERENT STANDARD MORALITY EVEN NOW YOU KNOW TEN YEARS LATER THAT THEY SAY WHLL HE'S A HYPOCRITE HYPOCRISY YOU SHOULD RECOGNIZS IS NOT ACTUALLY IN ATTACK ON THEBEHAVIOR HYPOCRISIES AN ATTACK ON THE STANDARD WHICH PRESUMBLEY IS WHY THEY'RE GOING OUT FRUSSEL BRANNOW AS OPOST WHEN WHO'S ACTALLY ENGAGED IN THE BEHAVIOR O CAM MEANWHILE UNITED AUTO WORKERS ARE STRIKING AGAINST THE DETROIT THREE THAT BH G M FORD AND STILLANTIS THEY WARE SET TO RESUME TALKS STARTING ON SUNDAY FOLLOWING THE START OF THE MOST AMBITIOUS US INDUSTRIAL LABOR ACTION IN DECADES THE FIRST I'M THE OU A W HAS GONE ON STRIKE AGAINST ALL THREE AUTOMAKERS  SIMULTANEOUSLY IS NOT ACCOINCIDENCES THAT THIS IS HAPPENING IN THE MIDDLE OF JOBIDONS ADMINISTRATION IT'S HAPPENING FOR TWO REASONS ONE THE AUTOMAKERS ARE GETTING SQUEEZE THEYRE GETING SQUEEZED BECAUSE JOBIDON'S NEW MANDATE THAT EVERYBODY SHIFT TO OVER TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES IS CREATING MASS OV PROFITABILITY PROBIMS AT COMPANIES THET ARE LARGELY INVESTED IN GASP POWARED ENGINES ALL THESE COMPANIES HAVE BUILT UP THEIR ENTIRE BRANDS ON MAKING A FORTABLE AND POWERFUL GASP POWARD ENGINES AND NOW THE BIDAD MINISTRATION COMES IN IN THEI'R TRYING TO FORCE ALL THE AUTOMAKERS TO COMPLETELY SHIFT THEIR BUSINESS MODEL THIS CUTS INTO PROFITABILITY  SIMULTANEOUSLY YOU A W KNOS THAT THEY HAVE THEIR MAN IN THE WITE HOUSE JOBITON IS A UNION MAN WHI SAY HE'S A UNION MAN I OMY HE HAS SYMPATHY FOR THE UIONS AM MING HE HAS BOUGHT AND PAID FOR BY THE UNIONS AND HASMEN SINCE THIN HE SEVENTY JOBITDON HAS ALWAYS BEE A POLITICIAN IN THE POCKET OF THE UNIONS AND SO AT THEY FIGURE IS THEY WILL GET JOBIDON WHO CRAM DOWN A SETTLEMENTS ON THE BIG THREE AUTOMAKERS WHARE SIMULTANEOUSLY UNABLE TO ACCEPT ANY OF THE DEALS TAT ARE BEING PROPOSE NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE DEMANDS ARE EXTRAORDINARY BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEIR PROFITABILITY IS BEING DESTROYED BY THE SAME BIDAN ADMNISTRATION NOW SIDING WITH THE UNIONS AS THE WALSTERTURNAL EDITORIAL WORK POINTS OUT SHAWN FAN NARROWLY WANT ELECTION AS U A W PRESIDENT IN MARCH ON A PLATFORM OF NEW MILITANCY AGAINST U S AUTO COMPANIES HE NOW HAS THE STRIKE HE APPEARS TO HAVE WANTED AS THE UNION SIMULTANEOUSLY STRUCK G M FORT AND SLANCIS ON FRIDAY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY FANS SAID THIS THING BOILS DOWN TO ONE THING IT'S CORPORIC GREED THE U A WS CALLING WALK OUTS OT SLEKE PLANS TO MINAMIZE HOW MUCH IT HAS TO PAY WORKERS FROM ITS EGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FI MILLION DOLAR STRIKE FUN WHILE STILL CAUSING PAIN FOR AUTOMAKERS SUTS BOUT GREED BUT THE W  W IS ALSO NOT CALLING LIKE A STRIKE OF ALL OF THE PEOPLE THE'RE JUSTCALLING ASTRICK OF SOME OF THE PEOPLES THAY DON'T HAVE TO PAY EVERYBODY M TANE WANTS A LARGER SHARE OF AUTOMAKE AR PROFITS BUT TO TRICE BIG THREE TA IS DEMANDS TO MAKE THEM LESS COMPETITIVE AGAINST CARMAKERS LIKE TESTLAHT AND LEAD TO LOSSES HE WANTS A THIRTY SIX PER CENT PAY IN CREASE OVER FOUR YEARS A THIRTY TWO OUR WORK WEEK THIRTY TWO HOUR WORK WEEK WHAT I'M SORRY WHO HAS AT TH WHAT I MEAN IF I I MAY NOT BE A MATH GENIUS BUT AF THIRTY TWO OUR WORK WCK IS IN EIGHT HOUR DAY FOR DAYS A WEEK THIRTY TO THIRTY TWO OUR WORK WEEK IN WHAT WORLD I COME FROM A WORLD WIN A FORTY OUR WORK WEEK WAS THE NORMUR OIN EIGHT OUR DAY FIVE DAYS A WEEK THIRTY TWO OUR WORK WITH OVER TIME FOR ADDITIONAL HOURS THE RESTORATION OF RETIDRY HELF BENEFITS WHICH BANKRUPTS ALL OF THESE AUTO COMPANIES BECAUSE AGAIN THUS HELF BENEFITS WERE BENEFITS DEFINED NOT  CONTRIBUTION TO FINE AND O FIND PEN BENEFIT BENTIONS RATHAN FOR ONE CASES AND THY WANT COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS S ANOTHER WORDS THEY WANT ALL THE THINGS THE THREE AUTOMAKERS HAVE RAISE THEIR INITIAL WAGE OFFIRS TO INCREASES BEWEEN SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE PER CENTS IN TWENTY PER CENT PLUS LARGE ONE TIME PAYMENTS AND IM PROVE THAT FRINGE BENEFITS INCLUDING TIME OFF BUT A THIRTY TO OUR WORK WEEK AND RESTORATION FOR TIREMENT BENEFITS FOR NEWER WORKERS ARE NON STARTERS IN MANY WAYS AS THE WALSTER TURNAL POINTS OUT THE STRIKE IS MADE IN WASHINGTON BECAUSE OF THE BIDE DMINISTRATIONS POLICY MANSATING RAPID TRANSITION TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES THE U A W KNOWS E VSE REQUIRE FEUR WORKERS TO MAKE AND WILL JEPARDIZE UNION SHOBS MAKING GAS POWER CARS BUT THE COMPANI'S ALREADY LOSE MONEY ON EVS AND THEY WORRY ABOUT MAKING TOO MANY CONCESSTIONS TO THW AE W THAT WILL CAUSE THEM TO LOSE EVEN MORE IT'S HARD TO OVERSTATE THE COSTS OF THIS COERCE E V TRANSITION THE BIND ADMINISTRATION WITH CALIFORNIA AS COIN FORCER IS MANSDATING THAT E VS MAKE UP AN INCREASING SHARE OF AUTOMAKER SAILS TWO THIRDS BY TWENTY THIRTY TWO CALIFORNIAND OTHER PROGRESSIVE STATES PLAN TO BAN ALL NEW GAS POWDER CARS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE WHICH BY THE WAY IS NOT THAT FINE THE FUTURE IT IS TWENTY TWENTY THREE RIGHT NOW LAST YEAR EV'S MADE UP THREE PER CENTS OF THE TROIT AUTOMAKER SALS I MEAN IS AMAZING TO THINK THAT JOBITON HAS BASICALLY FORCED THE AUTOMAKERS INTO THIS POSITION AND BECAUSE AGAIN HE

CHRISTINOM WHO APPARENTLYAS HAVING A FIRTH CORLUN DOWSKY A MAN WHO KEEPS SOM FAILING UPWARD APPARENTLY AND AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE LORN BOBERT SO IN THE DUMBEST STORY OF THE RECENT PASS LORN BOBERT WHOS THE CONGRESS WOMAN FROM COLORADO SHE A SHE APPARENTLY HAS A NEW BOU HER NEWBEAU IS A PERSON WHO OWNS S A BAR THAT IT STAGES DRAG SHOWS OCCASIONALLY S A GAVE FRIENDLY DRAGBAR IN GANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ASSBEEN GAYSKI WEEKEN WHOSTID AN EVENING OF COCKTALES APPTIZERS AND LAST AT HOOCH WHICH IS THE BAR OWNED BY QUINGALIGAR WHO IS THE THE PERSON WHO IS CONOODLING WITH BUBERT SO A G AGAN THAT'S NOT THE SCANDALED SCANDAL HERE IS THAT APPARENTLY BUBERT WAS CAUGHT ON VIDIO GETTING FRISKY WITH GALIGAR AT A SHOWING OF BEEDLE JEWS APPARENTLY SHE WAS LIKE VAPING AND LOUDLY SINGING DURING HER VIEWING OF BEEDLE JEWS AND THEN HE WAS PETTING HER BREAST AND SHE WAS I'M GRABBING HIS HAND TO KEEP IT THERE AND APPARENTLY IM THERE WAS SOME CROCHETY BEHAVIOR AS WELL SOME CROTCH BEHAVIOR AS WELL AND THEN WHEN SHE WAS WHEN THE USHERS CAME AND THTHEY CAME TO BOOT HER THERE IS A PREGNANT WOMAN BEHIND HER WHO COMPLAINE BOUT THE VAPING SHE REFUSE TO STOP ANDT THAT POINT THE USHERS CAME AND GOT HER AND SHE SAID QUO DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM AND THEN SHE APOLOGIZED FOR A HU HER UNCOUTH BEHAVIOR CHOGMATE UP TO A RECENT SPLIT FROM JASON HER HUSBAND OF EIGHTEEN YEARS SHE SAYS THERE'S NO PERFECT BLUE PRINT FOR GOIGTH RA PUBLICAN DIFFICULT DIVORCE WHICH OVER THE PAST YUMONTS HAD MADE FOR ME A DIFFICULT CHALLENGING PERSONAL TIME IN MY ENTIRE FAMILY IVE TRIED TO HANDLE WITH STRENGTH AND GRACE I SIMPLY FELL SHORT OF MY VALUYES ON SON UK I'M I'M SORRY NO NO N I THERE'S  THERE MAY NOT BE A PERFECT BLUE PRINT FOR GOING THROUGH A PUBLICAND NEVICAL DIVORE I'MD PRETTY SHURE THAT FIRST ON THE LIST OF THINGS YOU DON'T DO ON THE BLUE PRINT IS YOU KNOW GIVE PEOPLE HANDSHOPS IN THE ISLES AF BEEDLE TUSEWHILE THEY GRAB YOUR BREAST IN OU VAPE PRETTY SHURT'S THAT NOW THE REASON I SAY THIS IS NOT BECAUSE I DEEPLY CARE ABOUT LOREN BUBERT'S SEX LIFE I REALLY DON'T BUT THE POINT IS THAT AS ANOTHER ONE OF THESE REPUBLICANS WHO IS SUPPOSEDLY STANDING UP FOR FAMILY VALUES I JUSTON NON WHY DON'T REPUBLICANS SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN THEY PRESENT CANDIDATE WO ENGAGE IN THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOR IT UNDERCUTS THEIR POSITION WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND I DON LIKE HYPOCRATY CHARGE I THING THAT POCAS CHARGE IS STUPID I THINK YOU CAN HOLD VALLUYS THAT YOU YOURSELF FAILED TO MEET I THING IT HAPPENS PRETY MUCH ALL THE TAUNT HOWEVER RUNNING CANDIDATES AND CHAMPIONIN CANDIDATES WHO CONSISTENTLY DO THIS IN SWING DISTRICTS BOBERT ONE HER LAST RACE BYLA TWO HUNDRED VOTES I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S A RECIPE FOR SUCCESS THIS WHI SAY THE RE PUBLICAN PARTY THEY ARE THE STUPID PARTY THERE IS NO QUESTION AND HAT THAT STUPIDITY IS EXTENDING OVER INTO THIS GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN TALK MEANWHILE THE REPUBLICANS ARE HAVING INTERNAL FIGHT NOW OVER A SPENDING COT THAT WOULD THEORETICALLY O VERT A GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN SO ACCORDING TO BLOOMBERG HOUSSPEAKER COMMI CARTHY OVERTHE WEEK AND PRO POSED TO DEAL TO TEMPORARILY OVERTIGOS GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN WITH DEMANDS INCLUDING IN EIGHT PERCENT SPENDING COT FOR DOMESTIC AGENCIES AND RESUMPTION OF BORER WALL CONSTRUCTION HE PRESENTED THAT PLANS FOR PUBLICAN LAW MAKERS IN A CONFERENCE CALL ON SUNDAY EVENING AFTER NEGOTIATORS REPRESENTING KEEP FACTURS WITHIN THE HOUSE T GU BE SETTLED ON THOSE DEMANDS BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THEIR MUNCH REPUBLICANS WHO AREN'T TA WHO AREN'T GOING TO GO ALONG WITH TH PLANTS THE PLAN HERE WAS WE PRESENT TA PLAN FOR AN EIGHT PERCENT GOVERMENT AN EIG PERCENT COT IN SPENDING AND BUILDING SOM BORDER WALL IN THE MIDDLE OF ANEMIGRATION CRISES IN THAT WRONG FOOTS THEN IMA CRATS BECAUSE THAT'S NOT AN ASK FOR FORTY PER CENT CUT OR SEVENTY PER CENT CUT IT'S A PRETTY REASONABLE ASK JOBITAN EVENTUALLY COMES TO THE TABLE HE MAKES A GO THREE PER CENT CUT HE REFUSES ON THE BORDER AND THEN WE YELL AT HIM ABOUT HOW HE DOESN'T CARE BOUT THE BOARDER WHICH IS FAIRLY DECENT POLITICS INSTEAD AND AN POLITICO RIGHT HAS AN ENTIRE ARTICLE ABOUT HOW THIS ISN' GOIN TO A VERTO GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN BECAUSE BIDON WON'T GIVE THEM ANY THE OGAN WIL BIDON DOESN'T GIVE THEM ANYTHING AND AND MAC CARTHY'S ABLE TO PASS SOMETHING THEN THE OWNEST MOVES TO BIGN ANDTHE DEMOCRATIC SENATE TO DU SOMETHING GIOPE LEADERS TOLD THEIR MEMBERS ON A PRIVATE CALL SUNDAY NIGHT THEY HOPE TO BRING THAT PLAN TO THE FLOOR ON THURSDAY ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE PEOPLE LISTENING THE BILL WHICH WOULD PUNT THE NEXT FUNDING DEWNLINE TOCTOBER THIRTY FIRST WAS DRAFTED IN THE LAST FEW DAYS BY COLISH AN OF HARD LINERS IN THE HOUSE FREOM CAWCAS AND MORE CENTROUS MEMBERS IN THE MAIN STREET CAUCAS THE DEAL INCLUDES THOSE ACROSS THE BOARD CUTS TO DOMESTIC SPENDING EXENTING DEFENSE AN VETERAN SPENDIN AS WELL AS DISASTER AID AND WOEUD PAVE THE WAY FOR REPUBLICANS TO PASS A STANALONE FULLIER DEFENSE SPENDING BILL MHATWAT WOULD NOW HAPPEN ON WEDNESDAY BUT A BUNCH OF REPUBLICANS HAVE NOW SAID THAT HE'RE NOT KON TO GO ALONG WITH IT BECAUSE IY CAN YOU HAVE A COLLECTIVE ACTION PROBENSIDE THER PUBLICAN PARTY IF YOU'RE THE PERSON WHO SHOWS THE CROWD THAT YOU ARE THE PURIST THIS APPARENTLY MEANS THE WIN POINTS THIS IS ONE O THE PROMIS WEAKENING PARTIES SO THE THE STRENGTH THAT THE PROM WITH A STRONG PARTY IS THE TDE PARTY CAN CRAMTOWN MODERATE POLICY ON PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT IT THE POM WITH A WEAK PARTY IS THAT IT HAS NO CAPACITY TO HOLD TOGETHER ITS MEMBERS SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT HUMILIATIONS LIKE WALKING DIRECTLY INTO WALLS S APPARENTLY THE FREEDOM CAWCAS THE MAINSTRY COCK IS WORK THIS THING OUT AND THEN APPARENTLY A BUNCH OF PEOPLE COME OUTNTIY KNOW THAT OF COURSE INCLUDES MAGGATES WHOSE ENTIRE AGENA IN LIFE APPARENTLY IS TO BRING DOWN CEMOCRARTHES SPEAKERSHIP MAT ROSANDALE OF MONTANA IS OPPOSING SOS MARGERY TAILOR GREEN YE LIE CRANE OF ARIZONA ALSO THEIR OBJECTIONS FROM A BUNCH OF OTHERS PRESUMABLY SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WILL HAVE SOME GOODY'S NEGOTIATED FOR THEM WITH THAT SEAD NOW THE FACT THAT WHENEVER WHENEVER CHAOS IS PROJECTED AND AN A MAND WELL A MAN FINE WHENEVER CAOS IS PROJECTED TO NO APPARENT END BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS RUN THE SENATE AN TOBITON IS THE PRESIDENT AND SO THEY HAVE A BIT OF A SAY IN WHAT EX ACTLY AND UP BECOMING LAW HERE REPUBLICANS HABOUT THIS BE CONSORTED IN THE ISSUES THAT YOU ATTACK FOCAS FOR A MOMENT IN TIME OTHERWISE DEMOCRATS ARE GON TO HAVE SOMETHNG TO RUN ON ANDA THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT MEANWHILE DONALD TRUMP DID A MAINSTREAM MEDIA INTERVIEW OVER THE WEAKEN I IT DIDN'T GO AMAZING FOR HIM HIS HIS RECENT INTERVIEWS OF NOPPING GOING PARTICULARLY WHILE THIS ONE WAS WITH A CHRISTEN WELKER THE MOST NEWSWORTHY THING THAT HE SAID IN THIS INTERVIEW WAS HE MADE A COMMENT SUGGESTING THAT HARTBEAT BILLS LIKE TO PROTECT THE LIVES OF THE UNBOARD IN STATES ARE TERRIBLE WHICH IT'S NOT ONLY NOT PRO LIFE IT'S AN AWFUL THING TO SAY IT'S ONE THING TO SAY THE TAXTICALLY SPEAKING AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES I'M GOING TO TRID TO REACH AS MUCH CONSENSUS AS POSSIBLE AND GRADUALLY MOVE THE LINE BACK ON ABORTION TO ACCUSTOM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO PROTECTING LIFE BECAUSE IF WE MOVE TOO FAR TOO FAST THEN THE SNAPBACK IS GOING TOBE DRAMATIC AS WE SAWIN KANSAS THAT'S IT THAT'S A PRAGMATIC QUASTION ANDTHT TO CASE YOU CAN MAKE THAT'S NOT WHAT TRUMP SAYS WHAT TRUMP ACTULLY SEYS ABOUT A BORTION IN THIS INTERVIEW IS MORALLY AGREEGIOUS HE S HAS THAT HARD BE BILLS DO YOU KNOW PROTECT BABIES IN THE WOMB PAS WE FIVE WEEK SAX THOSE ARE TERRIBLE THAT'S THE THING HE SAYS E A HENDERAL BAN LANDED ON YOUR DASK IF YOU WERE REELACTIT WOULD YOU SIGN IT AT IFTENS O REN A COMPLET BAN I BAN IT FIFTEEN WEALTH PEOPLE PEOPLE OR STARTING TO THINK OF SIFTEEN WEEK SAT SEEMS TO BE A NUMBER THE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT DOWND YOU FIND AT  I WOULD I WOULD SIXTDOWN WITH BOTH SIDES AND I NEGOTIAT SOMETHING AND WILL END IP WITH PIECE IN THAT ISSUE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIFTY TWO YEARS I'M NOT GOINGTO SA WOUD OR I WOULDN'T I MEAN TO SAINK IS WUL IS WILLY DESINE A FIVE WEEK AND SIX WEET BEN SUPPORT THAT YOU N THAT TETWHATHY LERS A TERRIBLE THING IN A TERRIBLE MISTAKE A' TERRIBLE THING AN A TERRIBLE MISTAKE IT'S HER IN THE STATE HE'S IIN TALKING FEDERALLY IN THE STATE I THAT THAT IS NOT A PROLIFE PHYSICION BY ANY STRETCHING IMAGINATION NOW I'VAS THE TRUMP SUPPORTERSIG N TA SAY LOOK YOU POINTED THREE JUSTIS TO THE SUPREME COURT THEY OVERTURN ROW BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS IS NOTNAL TRUMKIN TO MAKE THIS A PRIORITY IN HIS NEXT TERM BUT  IN HIS LAST FROM I'M WITH YOU WHAT'S GIN TO DO IN HIS NEXT TERM AND THIS SHOULD PROVIDE YOU KNOW SOME FODER FOR TH DISANSE SEEM TO WORK WITH WHEN IT COMES TO FOR EXAMPLE SATES LIKE I WOE WHICH ARE VERY VERY PRO LIFE MEAN  THE QUESTION IS WHETHER RE PUBLICANS REALLY CARE ABOUT POLICY AT THIS POINT OR WHETHER THEY JIS CAN TRUST TRUMP TO DO WHATEVER HI'SGOING TO DO THAT'S RALLY THE RUNNING QUESTION OF THIS CAMPAIGN NOW MEANWHILE DONALD TRUMP WAS ASKED ABOUT HIS EFFORTS TO OVERTURN THE TWENTY THE RESULTS OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION BY CRISTION WALKER ONE OFTHE QESTIONS I KEEP ASKING PEOPLES IF THEY THINK THAT TDIS RACE IS RUN ON THIS IS THAT IS TRUMPKIN O WIN THAT RACE IT'S GIN ME DIFFICULT I'S GIN MAKE IT HARDER FOR HIM COULD HE WEN THAT RIS SURE BECAUSE DROBIN IS A TERRIBLE PRESIDENT SO COULD HE WIN MAYBE WILL HE WIN IF THIS IS THE CHIEF ISSUE THAT HE'S CAN BE DISCUSSING AND HE LOVES DISCUSSING IT'S OBVIOUSLY WOULD ANIMAES HIM I DEN NO IS IT SMART POLITICS THE MOST SING YOUR LAWYERS IN YOUR OWN ADMINISTRATION AND ON YOUR CAMPAIGN TOLD YOU THAT AFTER YOU'D LOST WULE THAN SIXTY

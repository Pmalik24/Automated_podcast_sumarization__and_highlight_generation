WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANLADPONCAS S O SCIENCE SCIENCE SPACE TO I MAINDRHUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TODAY I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF INTRODUCING DOCTOR SAMER HOTAR AS MY GUEST ON THE HUBERMAN LABPODCAST DOCTOR HATAR IS THE CHIEF OF THE SECTION ON LIGHT ANDCIRCADIAN RHYTHMS AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH AN BETHEZTO MARYLAND DOCTOR HATAR HAS MANY IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES TO HIS NAME HE WAS ONE OF A HANDFUL OF GROUPS THAT DISCOVERED THE LIGHT SENSING NURANS IN THE EYE THAT SET THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK S IS A FUNDAMENTAL DISCOVERY MADE IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS THAS LED TO AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL DISCOVERIES ON HOW LIGHT REGULATES ARE SLEEP ARE MUNE SYSTEM ARE MOOD MENTAL HEALTH METABOLISM FEEDING AND MANY OTHER IMPORTANT PROCESSES IF EVER THERE WAS SOMEBODY WHO UNDERSTANDS HOW ALL OF THESE PROCESSES INTERRACT AND CAN INFORM BEST PRACTISES FOR OUR DAILY BEHAVIORS ITS DOCTOR HATAR DURING OUR DISCUSSION TO DAY DOCTOR HATAR ANSWERS QUESTIONS THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR US TO KNOW ABOUT OR HEALTH AND WELL BEING FOR INSTANCE HOW TO A LINE ORE SLEEP SCHEDUL WITH OUR ACTIVITY SCHEDUAL SUCH AS EXERCISE AND HOW TO A LINE LIGHT ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE WITH OWR FEEDING RHYTHMS HE PRESENTS IN NEW MODEL OF HOW LIGHT ACTIVITY AND FEEDING RHYTHMS CONVERGE TO SUPPORT OPTIMAL HEALTH AND WHEN THOSE ARE NOT A LINED CORRECTLY HOW OUR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH CAN SUFFER IT'S A DISCUSSION THAT IS RICH WITH SCIENTIFIC MECHANISM MADE CLEARLY OF COURSE SO EVERYBODY CAN UNDERSTAND AS WELL AS SPECIFIC PROTOCALS TO DEAL WITH SHIFTS IN DAYLENGTH SHIFTS IN ACTIVITY AND IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE SLEEP METABOLISM AND WELL BEING OF VARIOUS KINDE I LEARN SO MUCH FROM SAMER AS I ALWAYS DO HE IS AN ABSOLUTE WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE ON ALL THINGS RELATED TO LIGHT AND CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS PHYSIOLOGY AND NARROW SCIENCE I DON'T THINK YOU'LL FIND ANYONE ELSE AS KNOWLOGABLE ABOUT THESE TOPICS AS SAMMER AND SO I'M DELIGHTED THAT HE JOINED US HERE ON THE PODCAST TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCINCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMAN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK IV BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SON DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THERE EASEN I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE O DAY IS THAT IT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRITIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBOTICS WHICH ORE VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOT MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSETIALY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITH OUT LETIC GREENS I GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBACS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY UT LETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATLETIC GREEN STOCK AM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEYL GIVE YOU FI

A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICION IN VITEMEN D THREE AND K TO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CAREVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATLETI GREENSTOCK CAM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIFREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLITES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND PATASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AVE TALKE MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS POD CAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELF FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIU MAGNESIUM IN POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IFHYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMON SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLITES IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THERE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT DOK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND NOW MY CONVERSATION WITH DOCTOR SAMMER HATAR SAMER THANKS FOR SITTING DOWNS MA O LESSURE OW WE GO WAY BACK A SO YOU ARE BEST KNOWN IN SCIENTIFIC CIRCLES FOR YOUR WORK ON HOW LIGHT IMPACTS MOOD LEARNING FEEDING HUNGER SLEEP AND THESE SORTS OF TOPIC SO JUST O KICK THE BALL OUT ON TO THE FIELD SO TO SPEAK HOW DOES LIGT IN PACTS THE WAY WE FEEL SO WHEN I GET UP IN THE MORNING I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTERACT WITH LIGT IN CERTAIN WAYS OR TO AVOID LIGHT AND CERTAIN WAYS I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY INTRACT WITH SUNLIGHT OR WITH ARTIFICIAL LIHT IF YOU COULD JUST WAD US IN TO WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS BETWEEN LIGHT AND THESE THINGS LIKE MOOD AND HUNGER AT CETERA SO I ME YOD DUAPISI THE EFICT OF LITES FORVISION SO WHEN YOU WAKE O NVU TIFUL ERIA BEAUTIFUL OCEAN LIGHT IS ESSENTIAL THE SUNRISE THE SUN SAD BLUE SKY BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAINS SO THAT'S YOUR CONSCIOUS PERCEPTION OF LIGHT BUT LIGHT HAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ASPECT THAT IS INDEPENDENT OF CONSCIOUS VISION OR IMAGE FORMING FUNCTIONS AND THAT'S HOW IT REGULATES MANY IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS IN YOUR BODY I THINK THE BEST THAT IS WELL STUDIED AND WELL KNOWN IS YOUR CIRCADIAN CLOCK AND THE WORD CIRCADIAN COMES FROM THE WORST CIRCL WHICH IS APPROXIMATE AND THE ANIS DAY SO IT'S AN APPROXIMATE DAY WHY IS IS AN APPROXIMATE DAY BECAUSE IF I PUT YOU OR ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING WHO HAVE ENORMAL CIRCANDIAN CLOCK IN A CONSTANT CONDITIONS WITH NO INFORMATION ABOUT FEEDING TIME ABOUT SLEEP TIME ABOUT WHAT TIME IT IS OUTSIDE YOU STILL HAVE IT DAILY WITHM BUT IT'S NOT EXACTLY TWENTY FOUR HOURS SO IT WILL SHIFT OUT OF THE SOLAR DAY BECAUSE IT'S NOT EXACTLY TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND HINCE THE NAME SIR SO YOU JUST TO ASK YOUR QUICK QUESTION ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU SAY YOU HAVE THI US ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOUR RHYTHM HOW DOES THAT RHYTHM SHOW UP IN THE TISSUES OF OUR BADY GREAT SO GREAT QUACIONSO IT SHOWSE UP AT EVERY LEVEL THAT WE KNOW WI STUDIE CHOSE UP AT THE LEVEL OF THE CELL IT CHOSE UP AT THE LEVEL OF THE TISSUE AND IT CHOS UP AT YOUR BEHAVIOR THE MOST OBVIOUS FOR YOU IS YOUR SLEEP WAKCYCLE YOU SLEEP AND KNOW YOUR AWAKE AND SLEEP AT THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR RHYTHMS AND IF YOU MEASURE THE SLEEPE EXCYCLE OF A HUMANS WHO ARE MAINTAINED IN CONSTANT CONDITIONS YOU WILL SEE THAT THE PERIOD LEGTH OF THE SLEEP WITH EN ON AVERAGE IS MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AN HUMANS TWENTY FOUR POINT TWO HOURS SO YOU'LL BE DRIFTING POINT TWO HOURS EVERY DAY OUT OF THE SOLARLY IF YOU DON'T GET THE SUNLIGH SO THE THE SUN LIGHT AT JUST THAT APPROXIMATE DAY TO AN EXACT DAY SO NOW YOU BEHAVIOR IS AT JUSTED TO THA LIGHT DARK ENVIRONMENT OR THE SOLAR DAY BECAUSE SO IF I NISHIN CORRECTLY IF I WERE TO GOING TO A CAVE YET OR I WERE TO BE IN CONSTANT LIGHT Y AND I DIDN'T CLOSE MY EYES Y IN CONSTANT LIGHT THAT I WOULD STILL SLEEP IN ONE COHERENT BOUT YES AND I WOIL STILL BE AWAKE FOR MORE OR LESS ONE COHERENT BOT MARLY NAW BUT THE TOTAL DERATION OF MY DAY SO TO SPEAK WOULD BE A LITTLE BE LONGER THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS SERFECT BUT IF I M AN IN A CONDITION LIKE MOST PEOPLE ARE WHERE THE SUN GOES UP ON THE SUN GOES DOWN AND I HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING OF THAT SUNRISE AND SUNSET YOU MAN HAVE TO HAVE THE UNDERSTANDING YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE CONSCIOUS UNDERSTANDING YOU HAVE THE DETECTIVE MARCO CIRCADIAN FORTIN TRAINMENT IS THE WORD WE USE IN TRAINING THE CIRCADAN CLOCK TO THE FORTIC ENVIRONMENT IS COMPLETELY SUBCONSCIOUS YOUR NOT AWARE OF IT IT'S NOT LIKE VISION WHERE OR IMAGE FORMING WHERE YOU ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT YOUR LOOKING SO IT'S ALL HEIG WITHALAMIC IT'S PART OF THE BRAIN THAT IS NOT CONSCIOUSLY DRIVEN SO YOU ACTUALLY DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT HAPPENS EN DOESN'T HAPPEN AND THAT WOUTD WELL GET INTO WHEN I TELL YOU WHY LIFE AFFICTS YOUR MOOD AND WHY SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH LIFE TO IMPROVE THEIR FOR EXAMP I SO THIS IS A SUBCONSCIOUS VISION YES O KA A BEFORE YOU TELL US ABOUT HOW LIGHT IN PACTS MOOD ICURIOUS WHAT IS THE RELEVANTS OF ADJUSTING THIS CLOCK FROM A LITTLE BET LONGER THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS HAVING IT SEEMS LIKE A SMALL DIFFERENCE TWENTY FOUR OURS AND FORTY MINUTES OR TWENTY FOUR HOURS LIKE WHAT WE WTWHAT'S WHAT'S THE RELEVANTS AN ME WHY SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT THAT SHORT SO LES DO TE MA IF YOU SHIFT OUT POINT TWO HOURS THA DAY IN FIVE DAYS YOU SHIFTING OUT ONE HOUR SO YOUR LITERALLY ONE HOUR OFF IN YOUR SOCIAL BEHAVIOR IN FIVE DAYS IN TEN DAYS YOUR TWO HOURS OFF AND IF YOUERE AN ORGANISM THAT IS LIVING IN THE WHILE SHIFTING OUT OF THE RIGHT FACE OF THE SYCLE YOU COULD EITHER MISS FOOD OR YOU COULD BECOME FOOD SO IT'S REALLY ESSENTIAL FOR SURVIVA I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE STRONGEST ASPECT OF SURVIVAL FOR ANIMALS TO HAVE THE ANTICIPATION AND THE ADJUSTMENT TO THE SOLAR SC AND FOR HUMANS AS WELL WHEN YOU SAY ANIMALS A MASSEING THAT APPLIES A ASU YA I SEE SO EVEN THOUGH ITS JUST A SHORT AT BIT LONGER THAN TWENTY FOUR IF YOU IF THAT ACCUMULATES OVER DAYS THAN YOU COULD FIND YOURSELF VERY MUCH OUT OF PASE WITH THE REST OF YOUR YOUR SPECIES IES AND SHO LE SAY ITS POINT TWO HOURS SO IN FIVE DAYS IS ONE HOUR IN TWENTY FIVE DAYS COULD BE FIVE OR SIX HOURS YOU COULD BE IN NEW YORK AND YOUR FEELING AS IF YOU TRAVELLS FROM NEW YORK TO LONDON SO YOU ULD BE HAVING GETLAG IN NEW YORK EVEN THOUGH YOU DIN DU EGETLAC TRAVEL SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE ADJUSTMENT AND IF WE HAVE TIME MAYBE COULD TALK ABOUT WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR SEASONALITY BECAUSE ALSO IT ANLOSS ANIMALS TO ANTICIPATE THE CHANGEING SEASON AND THE MORE YOURK HIGH IN IN THE NORTH OR THE SOUT THE MORE THAT THIS THESE WEATHER CHANGES OCCUR VERY HARSHLY AND YOU HAVE TO BE READY FOR THEM AND THAT HAPPENS IN IN N AS AS WELL WE WILL DEFLY GET INTO SEASON ALTY A OCAS SO WE LET TA SUBCONSCIOUS VISION THAT ALINES US WITH THE TURN OF THE EARTH HOW DOES THAT WORK WHAT'S THE WHAT IS THE THAT MACHINERY THAT ALLOWS THAT TO HAPPEN AND HOW DOES THA MACHINERY WORK YESO WE KNOW WE KNEW THAT IN MAMALS INCLUDING US WE ARE MOUTHS HUMANS THAT THE EYES ARE REQUIRED FOR THIS FUNCTION SO IF HUMANS ARE BORN WITHOUT EYES OR THEOBTIC NERVES AR DAMAGE HUMANS ARE NOT ABLE TO ADJUST TO THE SOLAR SYCLE SO WE KNOW THAT THE EYES ARE REQUIRED AND SINCE WE THOUGHT WE KNEW ABOUT THE EYES ALOT BEFORE TWO THOUSAND WE THOUG WELL SAYBE FOR THE YEAR TWO THOUS BEFORE THE YEARS TTE YES WE THOUGHT IT'S THIS FOT RECEPTORS IN YOUR RETINA THAT ALOW YOU TO SEE SO IIN IN THE HUMAN RETON US THERE ARE TWO TIMES OF FORTRCEPTORS THEY ARE GOLD RODS AND CONES BECAUSE OF THEIR SHAPE AND THESE RODS AND CONS SIMPLY TAKE THE FOTON ENERGY WHICH LIKHTIS MAE OFF AND THEY CHANGE IT IN A WAY TO AN ELECTRICAL SIGNAL THAT ALLOW US TO BUILD THE IMAGE OF THE ENVIRONMENT IN OUR CORTESES SUBCONSCIOUSLY CONSCIOUSLY IN THES SITUATION OSISPISION RITOUS IMAGEFORMING VISION ITS  ITS A VISUAL CORTICS AND ASSOCIATION ASSOCIATIVE CORTESES WHICH ARLOGU TO BI CONSCIOUS PERCEPTION OF THE INVIRONMENT HOWEVER PEOPLE HAVE FOUND INCLUDING ME WITH THE WORK OF DIVID PERSON AND IGNATO PROVENSI THAT THERE IS A SUBSET OF GANGLINSELVES THE GANGLANSELVES ARE THE SELVES THAT LEAVE THE RETINA THEIR ACON LEAVE THE RETINA AND PROJECT TO THE BRAINS SO THESE WORTS OF STOT TO ONLY RELA ROD AN CONINFORMATION FROM THE LIGHT INVARMENT TO THE BRAIN WE FIND THAT I SMALL SUBSET OF THESE GANGLIANSELVES ARE THEMSELVE FOT RECEPTORS THAT WERE COMPLETELY MESSED IN THE RETINA AND THESE ARE THE FOTO RECEPTRS THAT REALY LIKHE INVIRONMENT SUBCONSCIOUSLY TO THE ARIAS IN THE BRAIN THAT HAVE AND HOUSED THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK OR THE CIRCADIAN BASEMAKER WHICH AND JUST ALL THE CLOCKS IN OUR BODIES TO THE CENTRAL BRAIN CLOCK THAT ALLOWS THEM TO ENTRAIN TO THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR MI DASARCM INCREDIBLE SO INER AS I RECALL CASE I WAS A GRADUAUSON AT THE TIME IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND THERE IS THES LANDMARK DISCOVERY MAY BY YOU AGI PROVENCIO DAVID PERSON AND OTHERS THAT THESE SELLS EXIST THAT CAN COMMUNICATE DAY AND NIGHT INFORMATION TO THE BRAIN YIN THIS VERY SMALL SUBSED OFS SELLS SINCE THEN IHAVE HEARD BUT MAYBE YOU CAN CONFIRM ER REFUTE THAT THIS SYSTEM THAT CONNECTS THE EYES TO THE REST OF THE BRAIN IS ACUALLY THE MOST ANCIENT FORM OF VISION THAT THIS IS PROBABLY THE FORM OF VISION THAT SOME EARLY VERSION OF HUMAN BEINGS HAD BEFORE THEY HAD PATTERN VISION BEFORE THEY COULD SEE COLORS AND SHAPES AND MOTION AN AND ALL THAT AND THAT THE THE THAT THE SAME SELLS THAT PERFORM TES RALL ARE ACTUALLY SIMILAR TO INSECT EYES I THINK I HEARD DAVID PERSONS SAY ONCE THAT WE ASHE HAE A LITTLE BIT OF FU THE FLY EY IN OUR EYE WHAT HE TALKING ABOUT YE SO IT IS REELY INTERESTING ACTUALLY BECAUSE THESE SAME IPIARGISEES WE DISCOVERED THEY CONTRIBUTE TA LITTLE BITO IMAGE FORMATION AND NOW WORK FROM TO FINISH MEN SPECIFICALLY HAVE PROVIN THAT THEY DO CONTRIBUTE TO IMAGE FORMING FUNCTIONS TUT THEY CONTRIBUTE TO VERY AM LIMITED ASPECT OF IMISH FORMATION SO IT FITS YOUR HYPOTHESIS THAT THESE ARE AN ANCIENT FOTRESEPTES THE OTHER THING THAT ADDS TO THAT HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THEY ARE EXPRESSED INSELVES THAT DON'T HAVE ANY MODIFICATION THAT MAKE THEM LOOK LIKE FOTRESEPTR SO OUR THE FOT RECEPTORS THAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR VISION IMAGE FORMATION THEY HAVE VERY SPECIALIZED STRUCTURES THAT ALLOW THEM TO PACK THESE STRUCTURES WITH FORTOPIGMENTS THESE ARE THE FOTO DETECTING PROTINES SO THEY COULD DETECT THEY HIG SENSITIVITY OF FORTONS THAT PASS THROUGH THEM THESE I PIARGISIS DON'T H THES NEW FOTECEPTORS DON'T HAVE THESE SPECIALIZED STRUCTURES SO THEY JUST REALLY MEED THE LOROF LIGHT AT THE TIME WE THOUGHT THE NEED THE LORO LIGHT TO BE ACTIVATED SO THAT'S WHY WE THINK THEY ARE ANCIENT AND THAT'S WHY YOU THINK THEY A JUST TO ANCIENT FUNCTIONS THAT ARE AS IMPORTANT AS REGULATING YOUR BUDY SIR CANDIAN CLOCK TO THE SOLOR INFIRONMENT TO SOLOR THEY OR TO THE LADARSO  YOU MENTIONED IPIARGISEES INTRINSICALLY FOR OCENSIVES  THESE OUR SELVES THA CONNECTED EYE THE BRAIN THAT BEHAVED LIKE FOR HE RECEPTORS ESSENTIALLY AND THEN YOU MENTION A MELONOSN WHICH IS THE ACTUAL PIGMENT THAT CONVERTS THE LIGHT INTO THE ELECTRICOSANO MORE OR LESS AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT MELONOBSEN WAS IDENTIFIED FIRST IN FROG MALNA FORCE YES SO THAS THAT MEAN THAN WE HAVE LIKE MO PIECES OF FROG SKIN IN OUR EYES SO HONESTLY DAVID BERSON SAY YOU HAVE E FLYIN YOUR EYE BECAUSE ET SONS BETTER THE MORE ACCURATE I THINK IS THAT YOU HAVE A FROG SKIN IN YOUR EYE IS NOT AS CATCHY BUT REALLY MELONOSEN REALLY THE NAME MELONOVS AND IS FROM MILANO SIDT OPSEN SO IT'S MELONOPSN BECAUSE IT WAS FOUND IN THE FROG MILANOSIDES YOU KNOW THE FROGS CANT CHANGE THEIR COLOR DEPENDING ON LIGHT AND MILONOPSEN DRIVE THIS RESPONSE SO WHEN IGNASHOU PREVENT YOUR FIRST DESCOVER THES OBSENCE IN FROGS LUCKILY HE WAS MARTENOG TO SEE IF THEY ARE EXPRSS IN THE FROG EYE THEY WERE EXPRESS IN THE FROG EYE AND IT WAL APPEARS TO BE RETINAL GANGLIN SELVES WHICH I TOLD YOU THON THAT CONNECT THEEYE TO THE BRAIN HE HAD THE INSIGHT TO GO AND SEE IF THEY ARE EXPRESS IN THE MONKEY YE AND HE FOUND THAT THEY ARE ALSO EXPRESS IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE RETON GANGASELLS AND REALLY THAT WHAT OPENED THE FIELD WIDE OPEN THEN THE F IT PERSON THAD THE SEMINAL EXPERIMENT WHERE HE WENT TO THE BRAIN WHERE THE CENTRAL OSCILLATOR THAT THE OSCILLATER THE DRIV CIR CADIN RITHEM IN THE BRINCL THE SUPER CASMATIC NUCLEUS THAT HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS TO RECEIVE RETINAL IMPORT AND HE LABLLED THE SELLS A PROJECT THERE AND THEN HE FOUND THAT EVEN IF YOU DESTROY RORS AND CONS YOU COULD GET LIGHT RESPONSES FROM THESE SELLS SO YOU COULD IMAGIN HE HE NEALLY FAINTED WHEN HE SA THAT THESE SELS CAN RESPOND INDEPENDED COMPLETELY IN THE ABSENCE OF RON ANCONIMPI'LL NEVER FORGET READING THOSE PAPERS AN TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE I WAS AT THE MEANING IN D SE WHEN EGISHA THE IGNACIO IGI WE CALL MEGI SHOW THIS IMAGE OF THIS THASY WHAT IS FROG MALENA FORDS IN THE HUMAN EYE HEOLS I OW MY GOODNESSTES IS THE EN A AND I WANT TO GET INTO HOW LIGHT ACHICAN CONTROL CIRCATING RITHMS AMOMENTLY BUT I THINK A IT'S WORTH MENTIONING NOW THAT A PEOPLE WHO ARE PATTERN VISION BLINDS SO PEOPLE WHO CANNOT SEE AND NO CONSCIOUS VISION BUT HAVE EYES MANY OF THEM STILL HAVE THE CELLS THESE MELONOBSEN INTRINSICALLY FOR OSENSE THIMSELVES AND CAN UT ESSENTIALLY MATCH OR IN TRAIN AS WE SAY ON TO THEY A LIGHT DARK SYDE IN FACT THEY POSSIBLY HAVE NO PROBLEMS IN CIRCADION FOR TENTRAIMENT THEY HAVE ENORMOUSLEEP WAK Y CALL BUT THET TOLLY BLIND BUT THEY ARE TOTALLY IMAGE MIND AND WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS THAT AND THIS STORY I HEARD FROM TRACKSISLERS IL GIVE HIM CREDIT THAT SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE IMAGE BRID USUALLY THEY GET DRY EYES AND THEY GIVE THEM LOW OF PAIN AND DOCTORS USED TO THINK OL THER SINCE THEY ARE IMAGE BLIND AND THEIR GETTING DRY EYEWHIE DON'T YOU JUST REMOVE THEIR EYES THEY NOT USING THEM ANIMOR AND THE MINUTE THEY WOULD REMOVE THEIR EYES THEY START HAVING SICKLICAL SLEEP PROBLEMS INDICATING THAT NOW THEY ARE NOT IN TRAINING TO THE LIGHT DARK CYCLE AND AUR HAVING SICKLICAL GETLAGS WHEN THEIR CLOCK SHIFTS THROUGH THE LIGHT DARK CYCLE BAT'S REALLY INTERESTING AND ARE I HEAR FROM A NUMBER OF BLIND PEOPLE I KNOW IN MY VARIOUS AR ASPECTS OF MY JOB AND THEY ALOT OF THEM HAVE ISSUES WITH WITH SLEEP I THINK IMPART BECAUSE THEY DON'T REALIZE THAT THEY TOO NEED TO SEE LIGHTED PARTICULAR TIMES OF DAY OR NIGHT IN ORDER TO ISLER INTERSCADUAL ASLE WHI THING THAT'S A PERFECT AN SEGWAY FOR US TO TALK ABOUT HOW LIGHT AND VIEWING LIGHT CAN IMPACT OUR SLEP WAKE RHYTHMS AND THEN WE WHO MOVE INTO SOME OF THE OTHER WAYS IN WHICH LIGKE CAN IMPACT OTHER FORMS OF BODLY FUNCTION YE SO I I LOVE THE WAY YOU SET IT UP BECAUSE ONE OF THE WMOST INTERESTING AND DIFFICULT ASPECT OF TRYING TO EDUCATE PEOPLE ABOUT LIHT EFFECT ON SUBCONSCIOUS VISION IS THAT IS SUBCONSCIOUS SO WE ALL AWARE OF WHAT WE THINK IS INTENSITY BECAUSE WE SEE THE ROOM BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU TALK TO PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS AND SELF LIKE THAT THEY KNOW THAT THE INTENSITYIS VARIES GRATLY BUT OUR SYSTEM BECAUSE WE HAVE TO SEE THE SAME WAY IN VERY BRIGHT CONDITIONS AND VERY DIM CONDITIONS WE NOT VERY GOOD AT ESTIMATING AND INTENSITY CONSCIOUSLY SO WHEN YOU TRY TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT INTENSITY REALLY STRUGGLE BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY KNOW INTENSITIES BUT THEY REALLY DON'T BECOUMIN LIGHT INTEND LIGHT INTENSITY SO SO THAT THE ONES THEMSELF HAVE AN INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO ADAPT TO DIFFERENT LIGHT CONDITIONS SO YOU CAN SEE AT ALL DIFFERENT CONDITIONS OTHERWISE IT BE DISASTER YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T CHANGE THE THE SETTING ON YOUR CAMERA AND YOU GO FROM INSIDE THE ROOM TO THE OUTSIDE IT BECOMES COMPLETELY WHIHT YOU DON'T SEE ANYTHING SO IF YOUR CONES DON'E ADAPT TO THE INVIRONMENT THEN YOU LET THEM BE ABLE TO SEE IN THIS ROOM AND IN ON THE BEA TRING BUT THE PROBLEM IS YOUR YOUR IPIARGI SEIZE THE SELVES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THEY MEASURE INTENSITY PRETTY WELL THEY REALLY KNOW WHAT INTENSITY IS THEY HAVE A VERY GOOD LINEAR MEASUREMENT OF INTENSITY THEY DON'T ADAPT AS WELL THEY DON'T ADAPT ACTUALLY THAT MUCH TO BE HONEST SO THAT TELLS YOU THAT SUBCONSCIOUSLY THE SYSTEM IS USED TO MEASUREING LIGHT INTENSITY IN A NATURAL ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE NOUT IN THE NATURAL INVINE WE DON'T HAVE YOU NO INDUSTRIALIZE LIGHTING THEN YOU YOU KNOW YOUR SYSTEM IS FUNCTIONING VERY WELL BUT NOW WHEN WE CHANGE THESE INVIRONMENTS WEU COULD REALLY MISS UP OURSELF SO YOU HAVE TO TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO UNDERSAND INTENSITY AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE AND I THINK I LOVE TO DO IT MYSELF I DO IT IN WHAT IS CALLED THE LOWEST AMOUNT OF FLIGHT REQUIRED TO ALLOW YOU TO SEE COMFORTABLY SO YOU HAVE TO DO THIS AS AN FUNNY EXPERIMENT O GET SO EXPLAININ ME HOW THIS GOES ERAND MAYBE WE COULD BREAKE IT UP INT THE DAY AN TWO AN THREE OR FOUR PART SO LET'S SAY I ASSUMING THAT MOST PEOPLE WAKE UP IN THE MORNING I SUPPOSE TO NIGHT SHIFT WORKERS ET CETERA WE COAN TALK ABOUT Y LATER BUT WAKE UP IN THE MORNING SOS DIVIDE THE DAY IN THE QUARTERS WHAT IS WHAT IS THE PROPER WAY TO INTERACT WITH LIGHT IN THE FIRST PART OF THE DAY SO I HONESTLYVING THE EASIEST THING IS WAKING OUP GET AS MUCH LIGHT AS YOU CINTO YOUR EYES YAH IT'S REELY NICE YOUR SYSTEM IS PRIME IF YOUR IN TRAIN IS PRIME TO GET LIGHT THE SUN SHOULD BE OUT MOST ANIMALS N THE WHITE THEY ACTUALLY SEEM TO TRACT THAT THE SUN THE SUN HAS A UGE INFLUENCE ON LIFE ON OTH IS ACTUALLY LIFE ON EARTH IS BECAUSE OF SUN SO THAT'S EASY IN THE MORNING WHEN YOU WAKE UP WEU NEED LIGHT O CITIS WHA IT WHAT  BEHAVIOUR OR PRACTISE THE THET YOU RECOMMEND DOES IT LET'S SAY SOMEBODY IS IN A CONDITION WHERE THERE'S LOT A CLOUD COVER YE IS IT IMPORTANT TO GET OUTSIDE SO I HAVE TO TELL YOU THE CLOUDIEST DAYS CAN A BE MUCH MORE BRIGHTER THAN YOU WO YOU COULD ASK ANY PHOTOGRAPHER IT CLOUDY DAY UNLESS IT'S REALLY DARK DARK CLOS USUALLY CLOUDY DAYS HAVE MUCH MORE BRIGHT OUTSIDE THAT INSIDE THE ROOM EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE GOOD LIGHTING INSIDE THE RUME SO I THINK IN THE OUTSIDE IS USUALLY EVEN WHEN IS CLOUDY YOU CAN GET ENOUGH INTENSITY TO HELP YOU ADJUST YOUR SICLE TO THE DAY NIGHT SYCLE SO HOW HALLONG DO YOU  U Y THESE ARE GENERAL RULES OF THUMBER ALONG YOU RECOMMEND PEOPLE GO OUT IS  DO IT DAILY YOU POSSIBLY NEED VERY IFIF YOU DO IT DAILY BECAUSE YOU REMEMBER THIS THINGS CAN HAPPEN ON A DAILY MAN SO ITS RETS SA THE CLUGLY  CRACKING AND ON A REGULAR ABSOLUTELY IT'S IT'S FORTON COUNTING ITS TRACKING OUT SAY FIFTEEN MINUTES IF YOU DON'T DO IT DAILY YOU MAY WANT I INCREASE IT AND WE TALK ABOUT WHEN YOU TRAVEL WHAT YOU COULD DO BUT BUT YOU HAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES SHOULD BE FUN YOU DO IT MORE IT DOESN'T HURT AND THROUGH A WINDOW I WAS MY UNDERSTANDINGS THAT THROUGH WINDOW IT DRAMMATICALLY DECREASES THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT ENERGY IND D IT DEPENDS OF HOW YOU KNOW HOW THICK THE WINDOWS AR AND HOW DARKTHEY ARE SO IT BUT IT'S ALSO NICE TO GO OUTSIDE AND TO FEEL THE SEASON SUN GLASSES OF I DON'T USE SUN GLASSES I AV BUT YOU HAVE THE YOUR GORDANIAN FOR YO IGMEN YOU KNOWASE DE YA WHEREAS MY LET ISELRERY SENSITIVE A NOT SO I BUT I PERSONALLY YOU KNOW IF IM IN THE SHADE OR IF IT'S NOT INCREDIBLY BRIGHT I TRY TO ESPECIALLY IN THE MORNING BAMEN ALSO AN EARLY PERSONS SO WE HAVE TO DEFRECIATE  EARLY UNDR YOU WAKER I WAKE UPAT FOR THIRTY IN THE MORNINN TI UN IS IN IS O NOT OUT YET SO IS WHAT YOU DO  S URN ON ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS I USUALLY DON'T TURN ON ARTIFICIAL LIGHT BECAUSE I KNOW THE SUN IS GOING TO COME UP EVENTUALLY BUT THUS WH I DON'T LIKE THE CHANGE IN THE TIMING THAT THEY DO YOU MA WHAT YOU DOU BETWEEN FOR THIRTY AM AN SEVEN AM I ME I DUS I CONPUTEOASION SORPOSII GET ENOUGH LIGHE BUN BUT IN REALITY I ME AS LONG AS YOU ULD LET YOUR BODY GET THE MORNING SUNLIGHT WHICH I THINK IT'S REALLY TO ME AND I THERE'S NO EVIDENC BUT TO ME THIS SYS IF YOU LOOK AT ALL ANIMALS PLANS THIS MORNING SUM LIGHT SEEMS TO BE VERY IMPORTANT AND I I YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE EXPERIMENTS TO SHOW IT BUT I HAVE GOT FEELING THAT IT HAS A HUSE IMPACK ONHUMANS WO JAMIES ISERS LAVIT THE STEMPERES SLEEP IVERE SHOWN THAT THESE EARLY MORNING LIKT FLASHES CAN ADJUST THE AL AMOUN OF SLEEP THAT ONE WILL GET MAKES IT EASIER TO GET ABSOLYP ABSOLUTE O CE SOAN AND AND THERE CAN WRIT ALSO TID THIS BEAUTIFUL CAMPING EXPERIMENTS THAT SHOWD I MAY MEASYOU TO DESCRIBE US AS A R ANDERFUL EXPERI THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL EXPANDHISH YO TOOK THIS OU NO COLLIGE STUDENTS THAT HAVE THE LATE ONSET OF SLEEP AND LAT WAKING TIME AND THEN HE SAID LESTGO CAMPING AND JUST DON'T OUSE ANY ARTIFICIAL LIGHT AND YOU COULD GO TO SLEEP AS AS AS LATE OR AS EARLY AS YOU WANT AND WAKE UP AS LETAS EARLY AND HE FOND THE YOU SHIFT IN THER SLEEP PATERN JUS BY EXPOSING THEM TO THE LIGHT NARXYCLE I MEAN SO N ELASTED AND IT LAST EVEN AFTER THEY CAME BACK AI TWO DAYS OF CAMPING RECET TE CIRCAS EV ALDAYS BUT IT IT LASTED YA IT'S PRETTY AMEASING YA IT'S REALLY INCREDIBLE OCA SO GET BRIGHT LIGHT OF SOME SORT EARLY IN THE DAY I DEALLY SUNLIGHT EVEN ON A CLOUDY DAY IT'S GOING OUSO BRIGHTER THAN IN YOUR LIGHT O TAT'S EASY OQET SI THENAN AND THE OTHER THING THATOULD LIKE TO MENTION TO PEOPLE IF IT YOU THINK IT'S VERY DIM OUTSIDE TESATES VERY CLOUDY STAY LONGER SO REMEMBER INTENSITY IS ONLY ONE COMPON DURATION IS ALSO INPORTANT BECAUSE REMEMBER THAT THE CIRCADIAN SYSTEM I'S NOT LIKE THE IMAGE SYSTEM IN THE AMIST SYSTEM YOU HAVE TO CHANGE EVERY SECOND BECAUSE YOU LOOKING AT DIFFERENT OBJECTS YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR PROCESSION BUT FOR THE CIRCADIAN SYSTEM IT'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE AM I IN THE DAYNIGHT SICLE SO THE MORE YOU GIVE THEM THE INFORMATION THE BETTER YOU ARE SO IF IT'S VERY BRIGHT YOU DON'T NEED LOT BECAUSE THI'S CLEARLY AN A MAKE YOU FIRE LIKE CRAZY BUT IF IT'S NOT BRIGHT STAY LONGER STAY FOR ONE HOUR YOU NOL HAVE YOUR COFFEE OUTSIDE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT'S JUST GOIN  HELP BUT THEN YO SAID SOMETHING EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WHICH IS THAT THE CIRCALIAN SYSTEM IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHEN YOU ARE IN TIME EXACT NOT WHERE YOU ARE IN SOR ASED WHERE YOU ARE IN TIME A MENT WHEN YOU ARE O NO NOW I WAS IN CORRECTING YOU HAVE JUST MEANT THAT IT THE I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY THAT'S THE THE E THE INCREDIBLE THING ABOUT THE SYSTEM Y THAT YOU HAVE THIS CLOCK THE TWENTY FOUR OUR 'CLOCK IN YOUR BRAIN BUT IT NEEDS TO BE SINCRANIZED TO THE OUTSIDE SO COULD WE GO A LITTLE DEEPER INTO THE AS CIRCADIIN SETING BEHAVIOR AND COME UP WITH SOME GENERAL RULES OF THUMBS SO LET'S SAY IT'S A VERY BRIGHT DAY EXTREMELY BRIGHT YO NO CLOUDS THE SUN'S OUT YOU SAID TEN MINUTES FIFTEEN MINUTES AND I'LL TELL YOU IF YOUR SENSITIVE DON'T YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BLE IN THE SUN YOU COULD BE IN THE SHADE THIS GOING TO BE SO MANY FORTONES OUP THERE IN THE SHADE IS GOING TO BE PERFECT YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO SEE THE SUN YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THE SUN YOU NOS GRATEFUL WRIGHTEM INDEED THAT'S A DIFFERENT STOREY YOU COULD DO THIS FOR YOUR SKIN AND AND OUKNO PROTECTOURS KIN THAT'S NOT MY ERY O EXPRETISE BUT FOR FOR THAT EFFECT ON THE CIRCANDAN SYSTEM AS LONG AS YOURE OUTSIDE IN THE SHADE AND SUNNY DAY TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES SHOULD BE AMPLAMAND AND THEN LET'S LET' SAY IT'S KIND OF OVERCAST AM IU NOW IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY BRIGHTER TIT'S IN OUR SOLID CLOUD COVER BUT IN OTHODISEE THAT THE SUN IS OUT BUT AYOUR IT'S NOT IS BRIGHT HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WOULD TAKE TIS SET THE CLOCK TEN TO FIFTEEN SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT STAY FOR HALF AN HOURS SAY FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES IF IT'S VERY DARK ROT YES DAY FOR LONG OQE AND IF UM FOR SOME REASON ONE FINDS THEMSELVE VERY FAR NORTH AND IT'S VERY VERY DENSE A CLOUD COVER HOW LONG AND AT WHAT POINT SHOULD SOMEBODY CONSIDER USING AN ARTIFICIAL LIGHT SOURCE TO MEMIC THE SUNLIGHT YERE HONESTLY THIS IS WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION STIL BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE WE CANNOT DISCUSS THIS MAY BE IN MORE DETAIL THAT IF YOU PUT A HUMANS IN ARTIFICIAL CONDITIONS THE CIRCADIAN SYSTEM IS VERY SENSITIVE TO LIGHT BUT IN REALITY IN THE REAL ENVIRONMENT LIGHT ALSO'S AFFECTING OTHER ASPECTS THAT ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE SETTING OF THE CIRCANDIA BASE MEKEN OQ AND THESE WHICH RECALL THE DIRECT EFFECT OF LIGHT OR MOVE FOR EXAMPLE SO THAT IS VERY HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT INTENSITY YOU NEED TO USE AND WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH EXPRESSIOL THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN DISCOVERED JUST RECENTLY BUT I WOULD SAY IF YOU USE BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE MORNING II MEAN IT'S HARD FOR ME TO GIVE NUMBERS CAN GET COMPLICATED AM BUT YERE I MEAN IF YOU'RE HONESTLY IF YOURE THAT FAR NORTH AND YOURIN THE WINTER AND YOU WHEN I GET MAKE SURE YOU DONE USE THESE LIGHT BOXES I A WOULD SUGGEST THAT PERSONALLY MY THAT'S IS I USE UM IT'S ESHAL NOT DESIGN FOR CIRCADING IN SETTING BUT I HAVE A A NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY LOCKS LIGHT PAD THAT I BOUGHT AND I BOUGHT IT A IT'S THER VERY FORTABLE COMPARED TO THE A DON SIMULATING LIGHE I YOU DON' WHICH IR WHICH ARE QUITE EXPENSIVE FRINELY AND I I PUT IT THERE AND SO I EA JUST BASICALLY WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING I USE THAT UNTIL THE SUN COMES OUT AND THEN I MAKE SURE ONCE THE SUN IS OUT I GO OUTSIDE BUT I KEEP THAT THING ON ALL DAY AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOOD OR BAD IS A GOOD OR BAD I HONESTLY I DON'T THINK BEING EXPOSED TO BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE DAYS CAN EVER BE BAD BECAUSE REALLY YOU'RE OUTSIDE IN THE DAY IN UNLESS YOU KNOW THE WORST CAN O HAPPEN IF THE TEMPERATURE IS VERY HIGH YOUR BODY'S GAING TO SAY DON'T BE HIGHDRATE AND GO TO SLEEP SO YOU YOU COULD TELL ACTUALLY SOMETIMES WHEN IT'S VERY HARD THE MORE YOU GET EXPOSED TO BRIGHT LIGHT THE SLEEPIER YOU FEEL IN THE AFTERNOON WHICH IS COUNTER INTOITIVE ASO YO BET TAS TO PROTECT U SEETHING AGAINSITY IDURATION I THINK IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE HUMAN EVOLUTION FROM NEAR THE EQUATER IN THEM ABETWEEN NOON AND A CERTAIN TIME IN THE AFTERNOON IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HARD FOR YOU TO MAINTAIN PHYSIOLOGICAL HOME YOUSTATIC FUNCTION BEING ACTIVE AT THIS VERY HIGH TEMPERATURE TIME SO I THINK NAP BING WAS AWAY THAT'S WH ITHING IT HAS I MASURE FUNCTION O YOU STILL NAPPING WAS AWAY TO SOMEHOW TAKE YOUR WAY FROM THAT DANGEROUS TONE AND MAY BE THUS WIDE PEOPLE IN THE NORTHLY SAY IN THE WINTER WE CAN WAKE UP IN THE MORNING CAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THIS LONG LIGHT SO THEY SLEEP AT MORE AT NIGHT BUT IN THE SUMMER THEY SAY WE FEEL LIKE WE CAN'T WUT SLEEP WE HAVE TO PUT ALL THESE DARK CURTAINS SO I THINK YOU KNOW VENTURING THAT OF THAT MUCH NOR UPNORTH HAS BEEN CAME UP WITH PROBLEM BECAUSE THE VOLUTION WAS USED TO CERTAIN LIGHT IN VARONMENT THAT WAS COMPLETELY CHANGED WITH A HUMAN WITH OTHER ANIMALS I THINK THAT LIVED THERE LONGER A THEY HAVE COME UP WITH VERY INTERESTING ATAPTATION OF ACTUALLY MEASURING EVEN VERY SMALL CHANGES IN THE LIGHT IN THE LIGHTH INTENSITIES THAT STILL OCCUR ASIE EVEN IF YOUR NEAR THAT THE THE POLS EVEN THOUGH ITS ALWAYS LIGHT BUT THERE IS A CHANGE IN THE LIGHT INTENSITY ACROSS WITH THN IGHTCYCLE SO YOUR SYSTEM IF IT'S LINEER AND REMEMBER I TOLD YOU THAT MIGHT BE OGESEES ARE INCREDIBLY LINEAR CAN STILL MEASURE ALL THIS IS LOWER LIGHT THAN HIGOR LIFE IF IF IF THE ORGANISM HAS THE ABILITY TO DO THAT MOSE YES IT'S INTERESTING AVE SPENT SO MUCH TIME A LEARNING FROM YOU AFORTUNATELY ABOUT THESE CELLS AND YET I NEVER REALLY APPRECIATED UNTIL NOW HOW ON THE ONE HAND THEY ARE TRACKING THE AMOUNT OF LIGH TO UNDERSTAND WHEN WE ARE IN TIME RELATIVE TO THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE BUT ALSO THAT YOU KEEP MENTIONING THIS THIS LINEER MEASUREMENT OF INTENSITY THAT THEY REALLY ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHEN WE ARE IN TIME BY MEASURING THE INTENSITY OF LIGHT IN COURSE THE SUN IS THE MOST INTENS SOURCE OF LIGHT AVAILABLE TO US SO WO CAS SO I THINK WE OM HAV NAILE DOWN THAT FIRST PART OF THE DAY EPASICALLY ITS GET TEN TO THIRTY MINUTES DEPENDING ON HOW BRIGHT IT IS AND TRYING YOU THAT AS AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE TO GIVE THE SYSTEM OF REGULALIS THE ES TI SYSTEM IS REALLY ABOUT AND AN YOU SEE THAT EVEN FOR THE EFFECT ON DEPRESSION IS ABOUT MULTIPLE DAYS IS IS SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY IF YOU MIS TAT ONE DAY YOU KNOW STAY LONGER IF YOU AN BUT IF YOURE IN HURRY AND YOU WANT TO DO OTHER STUFF THAT'S A GREAT OUR COMMEDY SO YOU MIGHT WANT A COM ANSAY WITH SOME EXTRA TIME IF YOU YESTERDAY OR TWO AND THIS WYY I AVE HEARD YOU SAY BEFORE IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE TO GET SEVERELY JATLAG WITHOUT TRAVELLING ABSOLUTELY SIMPLY BY STAYING IN BEING ON YOUR PHONE TOO MUCH NOT GETTING THE SUNLIGHT AND YOU SOW THET DURING THE PANDEMIC LOT OF PEOPLE MENTION THAT THE SLEEP WAK CYCLE SUFFER BOT A BECAUSE IF YOUR NOT GOING OUT AND IF YOU STAYING AT HOME AND YOU DON'T HAVE BIG WINDOWS AND YOU WAKING LATE WAKING UP LATE AND THEN YOURE USING VERY BRIGHT LIGHT TILL LATE AT NIGHT YOUR BODYIS GEN A SHEFT AND NOW YOUR DAYS GAN A START INSTEAD OF LIKE REALLY WHEN THE SUN COMES UP TE SAY AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING SCANAS OULYES GAN START AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THAT'S WHAT YOUR BODIES CAN A THINK IS THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY SO THEN YOU NOT GETLY BE ABLE TO SLEEP AT TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT BECAUSE NOW THAT'S REALLY FOR FOR YOUR BODY IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TIMING AND YOU COULD SEE THIS HAPPENED DURING THE PANDAMIC AT THE VERY HIGH SCALE PEOPLE GET DELAYED IN THEIR SLEEP WAKESICA LOK IN AM THERE IS THIS IDEA OF CHRONOTYPES THAT WE ALL EACH INTRINSICALLY HAVE A A BEST RHYTHM OF EITHER BEING A MORNING PERSON ACOTIS OF AN EARLY PERSON OR A NIGHT HOUR OR MORE OF A KIND OF STANDARD YOU NOR TO BETTER ROUND TEN THIRTY UP AROUND SEVEN TYPE OMETHING AND THE AND I THINK THERE ARE NOW GOOD DAY THAT CRIG ME IF AM WRONG FROM THE NATIONALSTITUTES OFMENTAL HEALTH AND ELSEWHERE SHOWING THAT THE MORE WE DELIATE FROM THAT INTRINSIC RHYTHM THE MORE MENTAL HEALTHISHES AND PHYSICAL HEALFISHI STARTS ACRAOU SO THERE IS GREAT DATER ON THIS AND THERE S COUPLE OF THINGS THAT COMPLICATE THIS THE FIRST IS THE PEOPLE WHO USUALLY ARE LATE THEY TELL YOU THAT THE SOCIETY DOESN'T ACCOMMIDE WELL LET BY WAT AN WHET WE MEAN PUL THE WAKE OFF LATE AND GO  SGO OSLEEP LATE AND WAKE A LATE THE THEY HAVE AN OVERWHELMINGLY HIGHER LEVEL OF DEPRESSIONN AND FAILURES A MI CLEARLY A MEN THE REASON THE PEOPLE SAY  SLEEP EARLY WAKE UP EARLY OR BETTER BECAUSE YOU MAN NOTICE THAT PEOPLE WHO WAKE UP GO T SLEEP EARLY AND WAKE UP EARLY THEY DO BETTER IN LIFE THEY NOTICE THAT I JUST PERFORMER THEY PREFOR BUT THE QUESTION IS IS IS THAT IN TRANSLICT TO THE SYSTEM OR IS THAT SOCIETY BECAUSE SOCIETY START THINGS USUALLY EARLY ORLY THAT'S THE HART WHER DISCRIMINATE AGAIN SLAVE RI WEF IN A WAY WE DISCRIMINATE RIGHT BUT THE OTHER EXPLANATION IS CAN RITES EXPERIMENT THIT THESE LATE RISER IF THEY WERE TRULY CHRONOTIPICALLY LATE WHY WOULD THEY SHIFT SO EASILY WHEN YOU PUT THEM IN THE BUT IF YOU WERE REALLY CHRONOTIFICALLY LATE AND THERE IS A FASE RELATION BETWEEN THE LIGHT DARK ENVARNMENT ATD YOUR CIRCAIN CLOCK THEN DOING THIS CAMPING EXPERIMENT SHOULD NOT HAVE CAUSE MUCH CHANGES BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU LIGHT SCAN AFFICTO IN A CERTAIN WAY IS THAT THIS IS THE RELATIONSHIP THAT YOUR BODY DECIDED THAT I AM ELATE SLEEPER LATE WAKING SO I AM HONESTLY AM STILL AN AN UNABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH OF THIS LATE WAKING OUP IS CONTROLLED BY THE LIGHT IN FIREMENT AND HOW MUCH IS INTEREST IAM SURE THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BUT ARE THEY AS BIG AS WE SEE IN THE ENVARMENT BECAUSE YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT GO OUT TO SLEEP A SEVEN P MA WAKE UP AT ONE AM THESE ARE CLEARLY ADVANCE FACE SO PEOPLE GO TO SLEEP AT SEVEN P M AND WAKE UP AT ONE AN A AND FEEL GOOD DOING THAT I'M NOT SO SURE THEY FEEL GOOD BUT LOST THE TIME YOU TALK TO PEOPLE THEY SAY THEY ARE HIGH ACHIEVERS BUT THEY SUFFER BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY THEY WAKE THEY GO TO SEVEN P M WAKE UP ADVANCE FACE SLEEPS ENTROM THEY CALL IT ITHE RE CALL IT ASINDROM BUT YOU KNOW BUT THEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SLEEP TIL FIVE A M AND AND NOT BE ABLE TO WAKE UP TI THREE P M RIGHT AND I'M NOT SO SURE THAT THE CIRCADIN SYSTEM IS THAT VARIABLE IN THE HUMAN POPULATION I'MIN CLEARLY THEIR ARMA BE SOME TANETIC FACTORS THAT MAKE A SMALL PORSENTERS OF LIKE EVERYTHING WITH BEL CHADE BUT I THINK MOST OF THE TIME THE LIGHT ENVIRONMENT MAY PEROLE AND ONCE AS YOU AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS IS A LONG TERM EFFECT OF FLIGHT ONCE YOU GET INTO A RHYTHM AND I I DON'T MEAN IT AS UPON IN REALITY ONCE YOU GETT INTO RHYTHEM IT'S HARD TO BREAK OUT OF THAT WO THEM BECAUSE IF YOU STAR SLEEPING LATE AND WAKIN UP LAD YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE MORNING SUNLIGHT RIGHT AND SO YOU YOUR JUST CAN A BE LAD AND IF YOU LIKE ME WAKING UP EARLY YOU'RE GETTING THE MORNING SULIGHT YOU'RE GETTING WHAT SIZE AV SAID ER ASAID HIS LAST NAME LONG  THE ONE INSTAFFRD WHO DID THA TH A JAMIES IT SIS DEIA HE AS SHE WORK FOR SIDE ICLAS AS ICS ERN TAS AN TEEWELAS THESES AN INAS INS INTERNAME YE BOTH PHENOMENAL SCIENTISTPA WHO WHAT WALD IT SEEMS TO ME IS THE CASE IS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY NOW IF YOU'RE MEANT TO BE IN EARLY BIRD AS THEY CALL AT AN EARLY PERSON OR LAY PERSON OR SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN IS TO GET MORNING SUNLIGHT AND FIGURE OUT WHATTHER NOT THAT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER AND TO UNDERSTAND TO BE EDUCATED ABOUT HOW TO MEASURE INTENSITY HOW TO MEASURE I PUT IT BTOIN COTATION CAUSE YOU EITHER GET IMMEASURING DEFIES BUT YOU CANNOT DEPENON I HA ON YOUR EYE TO MEASURE INTENSE ICAUSE I HOW WE DO THAT  YEURE YOU KEEP COMING BACK TO THIS SIE THAT TELLS ME THAT'S IMPORTANT IT'S TE AVIOUSLY SO THEYARE APS LIKE FREE APS AN LIKE A LIGHT MEETER WHERE YOU CAN WALK AROUND AND HOLD THE BON DOWN AND SEE HOW MANY LOCKS B YOU KNOW ARE IN THESE ARE WHO IMPLICATED BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO POIN THEM TO SPECIFIC REELIN SO SO HOW HOW DO PEOPLE START TO DEVELOP IN IN TUITIVE SENSE OF THE MEASUREMENT OF INTENSITY YE I THINK AT ONE POINT I POSTED ON INSTRAGRAM HOW I KEEP MY NIGHT TIME AT HOME AND I FOUND OUT THAT MY NIGHT VISION IS VERY STRONG SO I FOUND HOUT THAT I ESPECIALLY IN THE WINTER I ONLY NEED CANDLE LIGHT SO I LITERALLY USE THES TEE LIGHTS AND I PUT LIKE FIFTEEN OR TWENTY OF THEM AN ROMENTE AND ITS SO NICE I COULD SEE  IT CLEARLY DOESN'T AFFECT MY CIRCADANS DO IN YOUR CATS AND AND MY WIANI VOICE JUST RAL IT JUST GREAT RIGHT BUT I DON'T EXPECT PEOPLE TO HAVE THE SAME NIGHT VISION AS ME SO THE SIMP I MAY I TELL PEOPLE DO THE EXPERIMENTSO IF YOU PUT THREE OR FOUR LIGHTS IN YOUR ROME SWICH TO SIT FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES YOU HAST TOO OF SWICH TO OFF LET'S SAY YOU USING FIGHE AND SEE AFTER FIFTEEN MINUTES YOU WILL NOT RECOGNIZE YO SWITCHLESE THOU OFF MY GOTS FEELING IS THAT MOST BEOPLE WOULD NEED AT LEAST TEN TIMES LESS LIGHE THAN THEY USE AT NIGHT TO SEE THE PROBLEM PEOPLE USE IT BECAUSE MOST THE TIME THEY DID SEE THE MORNING SOMELIGHT THEY ARE ACTUALLY HUNGRY FOR LIGHT WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE SO THEY COME SWITCH ALL THESE LIGHTS ON BUT AT THE RONG TIME BECAUSE THEY WOK UP LATE I CAN NOW NOW I UNDERSTAND SO SO THIS MORNING LIGHT YOUING GOES WAY BEYOND APSOF SETTING YOUR CLOCK IT'S ALSO AWAY TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH HOW LITTLE LIGHT YOU NEED LATER IN THE DAY AND WE AND WE'EGONG TO TALK ABOUT THIS IN A MOMENT BUT HOW LITTLE LIGHT YOU GET LATER IN THE DAY IS A VERY STRONG DETERMINANT OF THINGS LIKE WHEN YOUILL WAKE UP WHETHER NOT YOU WAKE UP FEELING REFRESHED ET CETERA LET'S THAT'S THAT'S WHY YELL I'M GOING TO BREAK IT ON YOUSHAL ANTREW THAT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT PEOPLE TO NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHICH IS THE TRY PART TATE MODEL THAT THIS MOTE INCORPORATE THREE COMPONENTS WHICH YOU TAK ABOUT IN DETAILS THAT A LOS US YOUMANS AND ALL ANIMALS TO INCORPORATE THE CIRCALION CLOCK AND IT'S RELATION TO LIGHT THE HOME YOU STATIC DRIVE AND THE DIRECT EFFECT OF THE ENVIRONMENT WHICH INCLUDES TRESS LIGHT OLD CAND OFSA THEY HAVE TO BE INCORPORATED TOGETHER IF YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT I THINK RIGHT NOW IF YOU THINK OF ONE ALON YOU WILL ALWAYS MISS SOMETHING AND WHEN YOU THINK OF THEM AS A WHOLE THINKS REALLY BECOME CLEAR IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE I MAZE GAN WE WILL DEFINITELY WANT TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR TRY PAR TIGHT THEORY TAN HAN GOING TO DETAIL ABOUT THIS HOMY ASTATIC MECHANISMS I WONT TO MAKE SURE THAT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE I'M THINKING NOW I'M SURE ABOUT LIGHT AND HOW IT IMPACKS THEM SO THE MORNING LIGHT YUING BEHAVIOUR I LIKE TO THINK WE'VE TACK DOWN CLEARLY AND AND THANK YOU FOR THAT BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT THERE AND A I'VE TRYD TO RELAY THAT INFORMATION OF COURSE YOU'RE MY PRIMARY SOURCE WOR ALL THINGS SI CIRCADIAN AS WELL AS CAMI AND OTHERS OF COURSE A MA WALKER BUT UM THINK YOU'VE MADE THAT VERY VERY CLEAR NO WUT SAY I'VE GOT MY MORNING SUNLIGHT MADE MY BRIGHT ARTIFICIAL LIGHT AND THROUGHOUT THE DAY YOU SAID TO GET A LOT OF LIGHT SO'M WORKING AT MY DESK MAY BE I'LL I'LL GO OUT DURING THE DAY A FEW TIMES BUT I'M WORKING AT MY COMPUTER I'M DOING THINGS IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT LIGHT YOUING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY THAT PEOPLE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND WORK AN THEY JUST  SORT OF FREE STYLE IT DEPENDING ON WHAT THEY DO MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT A YOU KNOW IN A DARK ROOM YER HUM EL  I GOT FEELING IF YOU GOT YOUR MORNING SON LIGHT YOU WALK FROM YOUR CARS SLOWLY OR YOU WALK TO WORK YOU DIDN'T WHERE SON GLASSES WHEN THE LISS WERE STILL DIM IN THE MORNING THAT YOU COULD SFREE STILIT THAT EVEN IF YOU DON'T GET A LOT OF LIGHT THERE IS A WAY TO JUST YOU NOW IN THE DAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO JUST WORRY ABOUT GETTING LOT OF BRIGHT LIGHT BUT PERSONALLY I LIKE TO DO THAT SI GO OUT AT LUNCH AND AND HAVE MY LUNCH OUTSIDE AS WELL THIS REMINDS THE BODY T HERE IT IS EVEN BRIGHTER NOW BUT THE EVIDENCE IS THAT YOU COULD LITERALLY HELP YOUR CIRCANDAIN CLOCK BY GIVING LIGHTS AT DONAN DUST BUT AGAIN IF YOU THINK OF THE TRYPARTIC MOGLE THIS MAY BE IMPORTANT FOR TO CIRCADIN COCK BUT IS IT IMPORTANT FOR YOUR MOOD SO THAT'S WHERE I THINK YOU E OR THE HOME OUSTATIC DRIVE SO THAT'S WHERE YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT SO FOR THE CLOCK FOR IN TRAINING YOUR CLOCK YOU LITERALLY CAN IN TRAIN IT ONLY BY THE DON SUNLIGHT YOU ACTION DON'T NEED DOONAN DUS ON CAN LEER FORGET THAT YEAND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'R DISTNGUISHING BETWEEN CIRCADIAN EFFECTS AND OTHER EFFECTS OF LIGHT Y AR BEING VERY PRECISE WE YET UM IS IS APPRECIATED UNTIL WE HEAR ABOUT THIS TRYPARTI MODEL WHICH WE WILL COVER FOR FOR THE SAKE OF THE DISCUSSION AM LET'S TREAT THE LIGHT VIEWING BEHAVIOR AS WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS WERE DRAWBACKS O VIEWING LIGHT FOR ALL BIOLOGICAL PURPOSES NOT CA CIRCADI AN SADDING SO IN THE MORNING IT'S CLEARLY GAN ASET THE CLOCK AND THEN DURING THE DAY IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THE IDEAS TO GET AS MUCH BRIGHT LIGHT AS YOU CAN BECAUSE YOU'RE FEEDING IT SOUNDS LIKE A SORT OF A LIGHT HUNGER EXACTLY I SEE I LOVE THIS WAY TO PUT I THINK THERE IS A WEIRD LIGHT HUNGER CONSIDERING THAT WEARE NOT FOR TE SYMTHETIC ORGANISMS THERE IS A WEIRD LIGHT HUNGERS IN ANIMALS THAT THEY NEED TO MEASURE THEY NEED THEY THEY NEED MEASURE AND I THINK THAT RELATES TO THE SEASON BECAUSE THE HORY PRODUCTION SYCLE OF ANIMALS CAN A DEPEND ON THE AVELABLITYOV FOOD IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN THE SEASONS CAN HAPPEN THEY DON'T HAVE CALENDERS IT'S CANNOT BE VERY HARD TO SURVIVE SO I THINK THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE SLIGHT HUNGER THAT'S I MEASOUR HYPOTHESIS IS NOT BE DESTINED INTERESTING SO THEN AFTERNOON AND EVENING START TO APPROACH SO I'VE HAD THIS WEIRD EXPERIENCE MAY BE YOU CAN NAM PSYCHOLOGICALLY OR AN BIOLOGICALLY DIAG NOS ME NOW SAMER SO WHERE IF I GO INTO A MOVING IN THE AFTERNOON LIKE A MATINEE AND I COME OUT AND IT'S DARK I NOTICE A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN MY MOOD AND MY ABILITY TO GO TO SLEEP WHEREAS IF I GET SOME VIEW OF THE LIGHT IN THE EVENING DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE SUN SETLE THE SUNSETS OR NIGHTS BUT I GET SOME LIGHT PULSE IN THE AFTERNOON THAT I HAVE NO TROUBLE WHATSOEVER FOR TAN IS HAPPENS IN THE DAILY ON ON A SINGLE TIME TO TO WATCH EM MORE OR LESS AN AS INTEREST AND THEN YOU MENTION THE CAMPING EXPERIMENT WERE WHEN THEY WENT CAMPING THERE SEEING TH SUNRISE IN THE SUNSET SO WHAT SHOULD PEOPLE DO IN THE AFTERNOON SLASH EVENING TIME IN TERNS THEIR LIGHT DURING BEHAVIOR I MEAN THE BEST THINK TO DOIS TO LET THE NATURAL LIGHT CREEP IN INTO DARKNESS RIGHT THAT WOULD BE THE BEST BUT CLEARLY THAT WOULD BE IF YOU YOU WANT A GO HOME YOU WANT A READ YOU AV TOK T OUR CADS YOU WINL NOT TOK YOUR FAMILY SO I THINK YOU KNOW IT'S NICE TO EXTEND TO DAY I DON'T THINK THAT'S LRONG IF YOU SOMEHOW CAN BLOK THAT LIGHT FROM A FIC CTING YOUR CIRCADAN COK SOSHOULD PEOPLE USE BLUE BLOCKERS IN THE EVENING I PERSONALLY DO NOT LIGHT ANY BLOCKERS THAT TAKE A SINGLE WAVENING FOR FLIGHT BECAUSE AGAIN IF YOU THINK OF A HOLOSTIC HOLISTIC APPROACH YES THE BLUE BLOCKERS CANNOT PREVENT YOU FROM AFFECTING YOUR CIRCANDING CLOCK VERY MUCH BUT THEN YOUR VISION IS GOING TO BE DISTORTED BECAUSE WE ALWAYS SEE IN FULL SPECTROM THE SUN HAS THIS BEAUTIFUL SPECTRO RIGHT AND THEN WHEN YOU START SEEING WITHOUT THE BLUE THINGS LOOK YELLOW AND IT CAN'T GET REALLY WEAR RIGHT I MEAN SO I I PERSONALLY I'VE TRIED THE BLUE BLOCKER AND I COULDN'T EVEN WEAR THEM I I THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST REALLY HORRENDOUS TO BE HONEST LONGE LINES OF BLUE LOCKERS I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE MISTAKENLY WEAR THEM ALL DAY LONG O MY GOD THAT WOULD BE  LOT OF PEOPLE TO THAT   LOTOF PEOPLE DO THAT THEY THINK THA THE BLUE LIGHT IS BAD I THINK THAT THE HONO THAT THE CONCEPTE BLUE LIGHTING BAD AN LED TO THE A LOT OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST ASSUMING THAT VIEWING BLUE LIGHT IS WHAT WAS GIVING THEM HAD IX WHEN IN FACT IT MIGHT HAVE JUST BEEN LOOKING AT SCREENS A AT THAT COSE DISTANCE O HEREIS THE PROBLEM RIGHT I MEAN THE BLUE LIGHT GOT THE BAD REPUTATION BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO GAVE A PURE BLUE LIGHT SHOW THAT E CAUSE A USUALLY RETINAL DAMAGE BUT AGAIN IF YOU USING BLUE LIGHT IN ITS PURE FORM IT HAS A LAW OF ENERGY BECAUSE IT SURE OR WAVENING BUT WERE TALKING ABOUT FULL SPECTROM LIGHT THERE ARE WAYS NOW WHERE YOU COULD CHANGE THE SPECTRE OF THE LIGHT AND KEEP IT WHITE BETWEEN DAY AND NIGHT AND CHANGE THE CONTENT OF THE COLOR WITHOUT YOU NOTICING SO YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TE AFFECT YOUR VISION SOW WOULD DO YOU GO ABOUT DOING THAT SO YOU JUST LOWER THE LEVEL OF THE BLUE LIYOU DON'T HAVE TO ELIMINATE SUCH AS DIMNA LIGHT THIM THE BLUE BUT KEEP THEN INCREASE THE YELLOW BUT KEEP ALL THE COLORS IN I CERTAIN WHIGHT SO Y YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE DIFFERENT WARMNESS OF WHIGHT AND PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS PHYSISUS KNOWHOW TO DO THIS PEOPLEE WORK WITH LIGHT NOWHOW TO DO THIS O MAYBE SOMEBODY IN THE WELL NESS SLASH I I DON'T LIKE THE WORD BUT BY OUT HACKING OR AN OPTICAL COMMUNITY WILL DO THAT SITHING IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANIGHT I SEE SO MANY HAVE A WORTHY BLUE HONORS I DON'T KNOW WHY WHY THEY LOK WHI THING THE DISERN IN FORMED I THINK YEA FRINK THAT I'M TO BE HONEST IT'S EASY RIGHT IT'S EASIER TO EXPLAIN SOMEBODY IF I PARCESEES RESPONDMOSTLY TO BLUE REMOVE BLUE YOU BEFINE RIGT RIGHT BUT THAT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS THAT BECAUSE THEY ALSO RESEIE RO AN CON IMPOT S YOU WANT A ACTUALLY AND YOU KNOW WE COULD GOING TO DEAT US THAT'S BORING FOR YOU LESSENERS BUT IT ALSO AFFICT THAT ADAPTATION PROPERTIES OF THE WHOLE RETINA SO YOU DON'T WONE TO DO SOMETHING SO DRASTIC THAT YOU TAKE JUST ONE COLOWR OF THE SPECTOM IT JUST SEEMS VERY COUNTER INTUITIVE TO ME TO BE HONEST YOU'VE TOLD ME BEFORE IS WELL THAT JUST BECAUSE THESE INTRINSICALLY FOR A SENSITIVE CIRCALIAN SAIDING GANGLING SELVES RESPOND BEST BLUE LIGHT IF THE LIGHT IS BRIGHT ENOUGH BECAUSE THEY ALSO GET IN PUT FROM OTHER COMP ONENTS OF THE EYE IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU BLOCK THE BLUES YE YOU AN YOUR LOOKING A BRIGHT LIGHT AT NIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO DESTRUPT YOUR SIRCARIASICLE AND AND THAT'S WHY DIDN'T ONE ARE GOING TO THE BORING DETAILS BUT THEMSELF THE FULD RECEPTORS HAVE A WITE RAGE OF RESPONSIBENESS SO THEY ARE MOST SENSITIVE TO BLUE LIFE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEEN THEY DON'T RESPOND TO GREEN LIGHT OR TO SHORTER THAN YOU LIGHT THEY RESPOND TO VERY VERY WIDE SPECTRE WITH DIFFERENT SENSITIVITY SO UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM JUST REMOVING FOR EIGHTY IN THINGS GOING TO DO ORIN ANY ATTERS YEL SO I YOUR HOME IS A CAVE THAT NIGHT PLACEACUEN WHEN I SAY WITH SOME CITS AND I CI WITH HANDLES THATS ARID AND YOU AND  YOUR A A I WEN YOUR VE AND YOUR ATS AND YOUR LOVELY LIFE YE I KNOW IS ALSO A PHENOMENAL SCIENTIST IN HER OWN WRIT M SHE IS AND BUT YOU DO KEEP YOUR HOME QUITE DIM TO DARK AT NIGHT IN FACT I DID GO TO TO MEETINGS WITH WITH SOME OF MY FRIENDS WHO WORK ON THIS AND THEY REALLY STRUGGLED WITH ME THEY SAID WE COULD HAVE BROKEN OUR LEGS LIVING IN THE SAME LIGHT IN VARMINT THAT YOU DO SO I AM AN EXTREME BUT I MEASURE IT FOR MYSELF AND I ASKE TRAGYOU MY WIFE IF SHE IS OK HERE WITH IT SHE ALSO LIGHT THE TIMNESS BOTH OF US CAN SEE WELL IN IN DIM CONDITIONS AND AND THAT HELPS US ALOG AM BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO MEASURES FOR YOURSELF YOU REALLY HAVE TO DO IT'S A VERY SIMPLE EXPERIMENT JUST TRIET TO DIM THE LIGHT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN I I CALL IT THE MINIMAM AMOUNT OF LIGHT YOU REQUIRE TO SEE COMFORTABLY AND THAT'S HOW YOU WANT YOUR ENVIRONMENT I A LEARLY AT NIGHT THIS IS WHAT I THINK IS THE GAME CHANGER IF YOU REACH TO ELEVEL WHERE ITS JUST BARELY YOUR LITERALLY ON THE COST OF SEEING UNCOMFORTABLY VERST THE SEEIMG VERY COMFORTABLY YOU ARE GOING TO BE VERY MUCH BETTER THAN I DON'T LIKE TO MAKE IT COMPLETELY DARK I THINK COMPLETE DARKNESS INDUCE ANXIETY INHUMANS TO BE HONEST SO I DON'T LIKE COMPLETE DARKNESS AM ITI LO DON'T LIKE COMPLETE DARKNESS THEY LIKE AL  NIN ANIMAL EVEN NOCTURNAL ANIMALS DON'T LIKE COMPLETE DARKNESS I MAY WE HAVE STUDIES IN ANIMALS THAT UNNOCTURNAL THAT IF YOU PUT THEM IN COMPLETE DARKNESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS THEY THEY COL THEY HAVE SEVERE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION LIKE EFECT SO KEEP THE LIG THIM AM YOU KNOW YOUSE RED LIGHT THAT IS VERY DIM IF YOU WONT A KEEP THE ROOM FOR SLEEPING RRED LIGHT THAT IS VERY DIM HAS VERY SMALL EFFECT ON ON ONCIRCANDAN CLARK AND BELOW TEN LOCKS OF THREAD LIGHT LITERALLY DOESN'T AFFECT SLEEP AT ALL SO THERE ARE WAYS TO DO IT IT JUST WE NEED TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC AND I FEEL LIKE YOU LITERALLY NEED YE WHOLE A LECTURE TO JUST EXPEND TO THE PEOPLE HOW TO DEAL WITH LIGHE BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS PEOPLE THINK WELL THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE YOU ARE STEPPING THROUGH A PIECE BY PIECE AND AM AND THERE IS MORE DOING THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS SIMPLI SAYING JUST BLOCK TO LIGHT OR GET A LOT OF LIGHT DURING THE DAY AND I MEAN LENTLEMO A AD NOTT IN PERSPECTIVE TO TELL IT WE ONLY HAVE THREE DIFFERENT CONES IN OUR RETEN THAT RESPOND TO THREE DIFFERENT COLORS WECALL THEM RED CONES FOR SIMPLICITY GREEN CONES AND BLUE COLLS YET WE HAVE ONLY THREE OF THESE BUT WE COULD SEE MASSIVE PALIT OF COLORS SO THAT TELLS YOU SOMETHING IF THE SYSTEM WAS JUST SIMPLY ABOUT A SINGLE COLOR AND IS JUST JUST REMOVING FOR EIGHT YOUR JUST BLUE IS SUFFICIENT THEN WE SHOULD ONLY SEE IN RED YELLOW AND BLUE WE SHOULDN'T SEE ALL THES DIFFERENT HUES OF COLOR BUT BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS NOT THAT WE SEE ALL THESE DIFFERENT COLORS AND THAT'S WHY IS IMPORTANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THE WHITE LIGHT IS MADE OF MANY DIFFERENT COLORS IT'S ACTUALLY LIKE THE RAIN BOT HAS WHY YOU SEE THE RAINBOW IS MADE OF MANY COLORS WHITE LYIGHT IS NEVER TRULY WHITE IT'S MADE OF MORE OF DIFFERENT COLORS IT'S LIKE THE PINK FLOID ALBOM COV EXACTLY COM EXACTLY EXACT A SO DIM AT NIGHT MAYBE DIM RED LIGHT IDEAL YOUR CANDLE LIKHT FIND THAT MINIMUM REQUIRED LIGHT LEVEL WWTHEN NEETIT JUST MAKE SURE WHEN YOU LOWER THE LIGHT SIT FOR AT LEAST TEN FIFTEY MINUTES LET YOUR SYSTEM ADAPT BECAUSE IF YOU HAD IT BRIGHT LIGHT AND YOU SWITCHET OFF SURELY YOU GEN A SUFFER BECAUSE YOUR SYSTEM DIDN ADAPTIT IT WAS USE TO VERY BRIGHT LIGHT SO YOU WANT TO ENGAGE YOUR RODS WHICH TAKE A LONG TIME TO DARK ADAPT SO THAT'S WHY I TELL YOU JUST WAIT A LITTLE BET DON'T JUST WICH O OF IT I DON'T SEE PUT IT ON PUT IT OFF SIT DOWN WAIT FOR TEN MINUTES IDIALLY FIFTEE MINUTES AND THEN SEE HOW YOU SEE AND THEN ONCE YOU DO THAT YOU WILL NOTICE THAT ACTUALLY AW I COULD SEE QUITE WELL EVEN WITH MUCH LESS LIGHT WHAT D YOU DO REGARDING SCREENS YE THAT'S THAT'S THE HARDEST THING AGAIN I MEAN THERE ARE BEAUTIFUL PROGRAMMS THAT CHANGED THE WHOLE INTENSITY AND COLOR OF THE SCREEN THES COULD HAVE DIM YOUR SCREEN AT NIGHT TO THE LOWEST PART I MEAN YES YOU WON'T SEE IT WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING BUT THE YUCAN INCREASE INTENSITY SO TRY TO DECREESE I MEAN JUST WHAT WE WERE TAKING ABOUT THINK OF LIGHT INTENSITY DURATION COLOR AND TIME OF THIN YOU REALLY HAVE TO KEEP THESE FOUR THINGS TOGETHER WRIHT WE'VE ROOM TOGETHER AT A COUPLE OF MEETINGS FROM TIMES TIME NO LONGER BECAUSE ONE OF US NOT TO BE NAMED HAS A SEVERE SNORING AS YOU AT THE OTHER ONE SUD OF HOMOCIDE ONT A WEN GUESS WHO THAT WAS I WHET I'VE SEEN YOU CHECK YOUR FONE AFTER DARK ONCE OR TWICE AND AND YOU DID IT BY SORT OF POINTING YOUR PHONE AWAY I ONI YOU RIL A TENDENTAN ASHLY A HORA HA CHOKING BUT I ANYOU DEM IT QUITE A BETSER HALF CHOKING BUT IT AHIL MAKE SENSE THAT EU NOT YOU SHINE A FLASH LIGHT IN YOUR EYES MUCH BRIGHTER THAN YO LIHT I DON'T LA OI ON DIRECT LINE SER IF YOU JUST LOOK  THE SIDE MOST OF THE LIGHTS GELAGO THIS WAY AND YOUR OWN MISTINES SO YOU OCE SO AND AS SILLY AS THAT MIGHT SEEM TO BEOPLE LISTENING HAVING WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT GETTING BRIGHT LIGHT IN YOUR EYES AT NIGHT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO AVOID AND BUT THERE IS THE REALITY THEND AND EVEN WHEN I CHICK SOMETIMES IF I YOU KNOW IF I HAVE SOMETHING AND I CHICK IT SO FASTENSE WE SHOULE OL SO FAST AM ALSO WELL NIN ASAGES AOS A WERE O THE DURATION RIGHT SO DURATION INTENSITY COLOR AND TIME OF NE IDEALLY I SOULD NOT IN I FORMS AN EYE PASS I DON'T USE I PA THAT NIGHT BECAUSE IT'S HART TO LOWER IT ENOUGH CAUSE IT'S A HUGE BUT EVEN MY EYEFL I TRY NOT TO USE IT THAT NIGHT AND LIKE ONCE IT BECOMES A THIRTY OR NINE I DON'T LOOK AT IT AT ALL UNLESS ITS WORL CUPER YEUROW COMPAN WHICH ER ADS ON TWENTY FOUR HOUR REBUT THAT'S ONLY EFORY THE BIG SOCCRFEN WY THIS HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY A NOPON ILLUMINATING ON LET'S TALK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LIGHT AND SOME OF THESE OTHER NON CRCADIAN OR SUDO CIRCADIAN EFFECTS AND AND WE WILL COME TRY IN LINK THOSE BUT YOU HAD A WHAT I CONSIDER ABSOLUTELY LANDMARK BEAUTIFUL PAPER PUBLISH IN NATURE A FEW YEARS AGO SHOWING THAT IF YOU DISRUPT THE EXPOSURE TO LIGHT WOR THE TIMING OF THE EXPOSURE TO LIGHT THAT THEIR DRAMATIC EFFECTS ON THE STRASS SYSTEM AND ON THE LEARNING AN MEMORY SYSTEM  WE COULD TALK ABOUT EACH OF THOSE SEPARATELY ERE TOGETHER WHAT WHATER THE EFFECTS ON STRASS AND THE EFFECTS ON LEARNING WHEN LIGHT VIEWING BEHAVIOR AND SLEEP WAKE CYCLES ARE DESCRUPTED NOW SO JUST TO REMIND YOU YOU KNO THAT BUT TO MIND YOU AND LISTENERS THAT I WAS TRAINED AS A CIRCADIAN BOWISES SO I REALLY WAS INDOCTOR NATIVE INTOTHINKING THAT LIGHT HAS TO A FIX THE CLOCK WHICH THEN COS ALL THESE DIFFERENT EFFECTS SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE THAS MY DOG MATHAS WOULD HAVE MADE ME REALLY HAPPY AND THEN TARO THE GATES AND CARAALTENUS JOINED THE LAB AND SAID N WE STARTED DISCUSSING THE LAW OF DADAN SAID WHAT IF THERE IS A DIRECT EFFECT OF FLIGHT THAT WE'RE MISSING INDEPENDENT OF THE CIRCANDICSO THIS IS NOT AN EASY QUESTION TO AS TO ANSWER BECAUSE AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ON THA LONG LIGHT AFFICT THE CIRCNIAN CLOCK SO HOW COULD YOU GIVE LIGHT AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE DAY AND NOT MISS UP THE CIRCADIAN CLOK LUCKILY WE CAME UP WITH SUCH AWAY AND THAT'S WHY IT WAS IMPORTANT TO DO THESE EXPERIMENT THE WAY WE DID THEM AND WE PROVE THAT THIS LIGHT DARK CYCLE DOES NOT DISLUP TE CLOCK THERE IS STILL A CIRCADIAN WITH THEM AND DOES NOT GLO SLEEP DOES NOT GO SLEEP DEPRIVATION AND YET SURPRISINGLY IF YOU GIVE LIGHT AT THE RON TIME OF THE DAY EVEN WITHOUT DESSUPTING THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK ORL WITHOUT GOES ING SLEEP DEPRIVATION AS YOU MENTION YOU GET HUSE MOOD CHANGES IN IN THE ORGANISMS AND YOU GET LEARNING DEFICINE SO THIS REALLY AND AT THE TIME PEOPLE HAVE REALLY HIT US HARD I MEAN IIT WAS REALLY HARD TO PUBLISH THIS WORK AND AND YOU YE WHYR I CAME OUT IN NATURE SO IN THE END YOU PREVAILED A BUT I WON'TO MAKE SURE THAT ARISHANSIUR YOUR SAYING THAT YES THERE ARE EFFECTS OF LIGHT ON THE CIRCALIAN RITHER APUSLEEP MEANING SLEEP IN WAKE WAKEFULNESS YES AND THEIR TIMING HOWEVER THEIR DIRECT EFFECTS OF LIGHT ON MOOD THAT CAN BE DISSOCIATED FROM THE EFFECT UPON ON SLEEPIN WAKING SO FIND INTERPRETAR CORRECTLY THAT COULD MEAN THAT WHEN WE VIEW LIGHT AND HOW MUCH LIGHT COULD MAKE US FEEL HAPPIER OR LESS HAPPY OR EVEN DEPRESSED STRAS LEARNING ET CETERA BINGO EVEN IF WE'RE SLEEPING AND WAKING UP AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME INGO I MEAN EVENTUALLY BECAUSE WE TALKING ABOUT THE WHOLE SYSTEM EVENTUALLY WHEN YOU START HAVING THE OTHER PRONS YOU ALSO DEVLOP SLEEP PROBLEMS BUT YOURE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND IN FACT NOW RESEARCH FROM THEIGO FERNANDISIN THE LABR HAVE FOUND THAT NOW WE KNOW THAT THE ACTUALLY REQUIRED DIFFERENT BRAY REGIONS SO WE DON'T ONLY HAVE A THEORY WE DON'T ONLY HAVE LIGHT INVIRONMENT THAT SHOWD THEY CAN BE DESSOCIATEN WE KNOW THAT THE USE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BRAIN REGIONS SO THE ES THE END THAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT EARLIER THE PLACE WHERE THE CENTRAL PACE MAKER IS THE ONE THAT RECEIVES DIRECT IMPUT FROM THE RETINA THROUGH THE IPAGECEIVES TO ADJUST YOUR CIRCANDAN CLOCK IS NOT THE AREA THAT RECEIVES THE LIGHT IMPUT FOR MOD REGULATION IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BRAIN REAGI WHATS THE BRAIN REGIAN COL SO THE BRY REGION WE COLD TAT THE PERY HABING LEAR NUCLIES AM MNOT SO SURE HOW GOOD OR BAD THE NAME BUT DOESMARIS THE PITCH BE AND WHAT'S REALLY AMAZING DIS REGION ALSO RECEIVED DIRECT IMPUT FROM THE IPIAGISES BUT PROJECTS TO AREAS IN THE BRAIN THAT UNKNOWN TO REGULATE MOOD INCLUDING THE VENTURAL MEDL PREFRONTAL PREFRONTALED QUARTEX WHICH HAS BEEN STUDYED FOR MANY YEARS TO BE IMPACTED IN A HUMAN DEPRESSIO SO JUST BY BY THIS AMAZING CERENTIPITY TO FIND THAT A RESION THAT IS SO DEEP IN THE ADVANCE BRAIN LIKE THE ME THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX IS YOUR EXECUTIVE BRAIN ONE OF THE MOST ELABORATED IN HUMANS TO SEE THAT THEY RECEIVE IMPUT FROM THESE ANCIENT FORTORECEPTOR WASTUNNING TO US AND TOLD US HOW MUCH WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF LIGHT ON A HUMAN BEHAVIOR SO HOW IS THAT FINDING IN FORM DAILY PROTOCALLS FOR YOU WERE FOR OTHER PEOPLE I REALISE YOU CAN'T LEEP TO AT ALWAYS FROM ONE PAPER TO DAILY PORYELS BUT IF LIGHT INDEED DOES CONTROL PREFRONT AL QUARTACS EXECUTIVE FUNCTION LEARNING STRAS A AND MOOD WO AND WHAT I AM WAKING UP THAT'S WH AN OP SLEEPING THAT'S WHY SHOULD I DO DIFFERENT THAT'S WHY WE CAME UP WITH THE TRY PARTATE MO BECAUSE YES WE COULD THINK ABOUT JUST A JUSTHING THE CLOCK WITH LIGHTS IN AND BEING DARK THROUGHOUT THE DAY BUT THAT ME NOT BE IMPORTANT FOR YOUR HOPHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTION SO NOW IF WE INCLUDE THESE OTHER EFFECTS OF LIFHT THAT'S WHY PREFER TO STILL GET A LOW OF LIGHT IN THE DAY I DON'T WANT A BE IN VERY DIM LIKE CONDITION THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS SO EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T AFFECT YOUR CLOCK AS YOU BEAUTIFULLY SAID AND IT MAY AFFECT YOUR MOOD AND LEARNING AND MEMORY ITMAY AFFECT YOUR ALERTNESS LEVEL WHICH CAN ANLOW YOU TO LEARN BETTER IT MAY AFFECT YOUR HOM USTATIC DRIVE MAY BE YOUR HOMEUSTATIC FACTO WILL GO HIGHER SO YOU COULD SLEEP EARLIER SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK OF LIGHT AS STIMULATING ALL THESE BRAIN REGIONS WHICH MEANSS PRODUCING MORE ACTIVITY WHICH IN REALITY THIS IS HOW PEOPLETHINK OF THE HOMOUSTATIC DRIVE THAT THE MORE ACTIVE YOU ARE THE MORE THE HOMOUSTATIC DRIVE IS BUILT UP THE BETTER YOU SLEEP SO THAT'S WHY WE CAME UP WITH THE TRY PARTC MODEL BECAUSE AS T E CIRCANIAN BIOLOGISTS I ONLY THOUGHT OF LIGHT THROUGH THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK AFFECTING BEHAVIOR AS A SLEEP BOLIGE THE ONLY THOUGHT OF THE HOMOUSTATIC DRIVE AFFECTING SLEEP AFFECTING BEHAVIOR AND FOR PEOPLE WHO STUDY LIGHT FOR VISION AND AND OTHER FROM THEY THOUGHT ONLY OF THE INVIRONMENTAL PUT BUT NOW IF YOU PUT THEM ALTOGETHER YOU GET WITH THE STRI PARTATE MODEL WHERE IT'S REALLY MINE BUGGLING AND IT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE THE ORGANISM DOESN'T WANT A DEPEND ON A SINGLE COMPONENT BUT IF YOU COULD INCORPORATE THESE THREE TOGETHER YOU COULD HAVE A BEAUTIFUL SYSTEM THAT IS WELL ADAPTED SO LET ME TELL YOU THE SLEEP WAKESIK RIGHT SO WE KNOW THERE IS A HOM YOUSTATIC DRIVE TO AFFECT SLEEP WEU HAV BEAUTIFUL TALKS ABOUT THAT WHICH IS PACELY THE LONGER YOURWAY WAY MORO ONVIOS SO THAT'S YOUR HOM OUSTATIC DRY WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE CIRCADIAN INFLUENCE OF SLEEP AND THE FACT THAT LIGHT DARK CYCLE AFFECT THE CIRCADIAL SYSTEM WHICH EVENTUALLY AFFECT SLEEP SO THESE TWO COMPONENTS ARE WELE UNDERSOOD NOW THE THIRD FACTOR IS YOUR DIRECT LIGHT OR INVIRONMENTAL IMPUTHOW MUCH STRESS HOW MUCH LIGHT YOU GET FROM THERE ALSO CAN HIGHLY IMPACT SLEEP SO EVEN IF YOU HAVE A GOOD CIRCADIAN AND HOMOUSTATIC DRIVE IF YOU GETTING ROUGT LIGHT AT THE LRONG TIME OF THE DAY OR OF YOUR BEING STRESSED AND THINKING ATE THEN YOUR SLEEPS CANNOT SUFFER SO YOU HAVE TO THINK OF THE THREE TOGETHER TO HAVE A BEAUTIFUL SLEEP WA EXICLE AND THAT'S WHY WE CAME UP WITH THE TRY PARTED MORA THE SAME THING HAPPENS WITH FEELING I COULD BEAUTIFULLY PUT IT TO PEOPLE YOUR HUNGER YOUR ENERGY LEVEL IS MEASURED BY THE ARCUIT NEWCLIES YOUR DAILY INTICK OF FOOD IS AGAIN DEPENDENT ON THE SEA AND AN LIGHT DARK IN PUT WE FIND THAT IF FOOD IS NOT AVAILABLE THERE IS YET TE THIRD IMPUT THAT IS NOT DEPEND ON THEIR SIAN NOT DEPEND ON THE ARCUAT DEPENDING ON A COMPLETELY BRAY DIFFERENT BRAIN REGIONS SO THE ANIMAL CAN ACTUALLY START LOOKING OR THE HUMAN CASTAT LOOKING FOR FOOD WHEN IT SCARS EVEN AT TIME WHEN THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ACTED SO THAT'S HOW THE ORGANISM THINK THEY HAVE TO EVALUATE MULTOPL IMPUTS FOR THEM TO DECIDE WHAT IS THE BEST CHYSEOLOGICAL OUT COME AT THAT MOMENT AT THAT SEESIT I SAY AM SO I WANT T GET INTO ARCUIT AND FEEDING BUT JUST TO KEEP A MAKESURE WE CAN YOU KEEP OUR HANDS AROUND THE A TRY PARTIGHT MODEL SO FINERSHAN CORRECTLY WE'VE GOT THE CIRCADIAN INFLUENCE THEN YOU'VE ALSO GOT THE DRIVE TO SLEEP RY ISHA ONE OF THE WAYS UM THAT I THINK THAT CAN BE BEST UNDERSTOOD IS IF SOMEBODY EVER PULLS IN ALL NIGHT OR THEY GET TIRED AROUND ELEVEN OR TWELVE OR SO AND THEN VERY TIRED AROUND THREE FOR I AM BUT THEN EVEN IF YOU STAY UP SOME TIME RIDE AROUND SEVEN OR EIGHT A M YOUR NORMAL WAKE UP TIME YOU START TO FEEL ALERT AGAIN EXAN TAS BECAUSE THE SLEEP DRIVE IS EXTREMELY STRONG BUT THERE'S A CIRCADIAN RHYTHM THAT TRIVES WAKEFULNESS ON ME OCATE SO THAT'S TWO OF THE COMPONENTS BEFORE WE GET INTO THE FEEDING COMPONET I WANTITS OT ABOUT THESE DIRECT EFFECTS OF LIGHT ON MOOD OCA GIEGOFERNANDASDATA AND THIS PERRY HOBENULAR STRTH SUE SO LET'S JUST FOR THE MOMENT SATISIDE THE TRI PART OF THE TRY PARTTIHT MODEL AND JUST FOCUS ON WHAT ARE THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF LIGHT ON MOOD AND THE WAY THAT I INTERPRET WHAT YOUV SET SO FAR AS THAT THE PROTOCALL THAT EMERGES FROM THIS IF ONE IS TRYING TO OPTIMIZE THEIR MOOD IS YES SEE LIGHT VIEW LIGHT I SHOULD SAY EARLY IN THE DAY IN ORDER TO SET YOUR CIRCADEAN CLOCK MAYBE ALSO IN THE EVENING AS WELL AND OF COURSE AVOID LIGHT AT NIGHT AT GET ED AS DIM AS POSSIBLE HOWEVER YOU SAID IT'S ALSO A GOOD IDEA TO GET AS MUCH BRIGHT LIGHT DURING THE DAY AS YOU SAFELY CAN IN ORDER TO IMPROVE YOUR MOOD INDEPENDENTLY OF REGULATING YOUR SLEEP WAKESIDE AND THAT'S A HYPUSCLESES HERE'S THE PROBLEM WHE IT'S NOT GET TO BE AS SATISFYING AS THE CIRCADIAN IS THAT AS YOU KNOW THIS BRAD RESION HAS BEEN DISCOVERED VERY RECENTLY HABENULA THE VERY HAPPY NOU BO WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT IT A LONG TIME BUT NOBODY KNEW WHAT IT DID SO WE KNEW ABOUT THE HABINULA BUT THAT'S WHY THE NAME IS CONFUSING IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THE HABINULATES O IT'S THE PERY HAVE GONE NEAR THEAND IT'S NEAR THEWHENCHE IS CALLED THE SEMBER HOTER NUCLY I SHOULD A I DON'T KNWHY MAYBECAUSE IF YOU DO THAT IT'S NOT A GET TE CASE SO FOR HEREVER AFTER THE PERRY HABENOUR LEARNUCLEUS WE SHOULD PROBABLY CALL THE HOTAR  ENA I ANANAS BERSONAAN THIS IS LIKE NERTY ASIDES ATTRIBUTION STOFF BUT I'M JUST GOING TO CALL THE HOTIR NUCLEUS AM WICAPEDIA LIGHTED UP A O CASE SO THIS STRUCTURE IS TAKING LIGHT AND INDEPENDENT OF SLEEP RHYTHMS IN CIRCANE RHYTHMS IT'S DRIVING CHISON ENOD HOW DOES IT DO THAT IS THIS THROUGH THE DOPENING SYSTEM THE CERE AN REASY WE STILL RECENTLY WE HAVE AN IDENTIFIED DISVISION VERY WELL WE DON' KNOW WHAT LIHE DUST TOWAIT WE DON'T KNOW HOW WIT TO ACT SO THIS IS AN AREA THAT DISRIE FOR DISCOVERIES AND WE'RE WORKING ON THIS FIGHT DOW BUT THAT'S WHY IT IS NOT SUCH FINE THIS IS LIKE THE FUNCTION OF SLEEP WHY DO WE SLEEP WE NO SLEEP IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US BUT WE STILL DON'T HAVE IT SATISFYING FUNCTION OF WHY THO WE SLEEP RIGHT SEE WE HAVE A WIE QUESTIONS THE WHIDE QUESTIONS I THINK IT'S OUR OUR GOOD FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE AT UNIVERSO WASHING IN RUSBEEN GELDER WHO ALWAYS SAYS WHEN SOMEBODY ASK WHY THAT THE BEST ANSWER IS JUST TO SAY I WASN'T CONSULTED THE DNINE EXACTLY BY NONE OF US REALLY NOW NOUT THE POINT IS MAYBE I SHOULD HAV SIT WHY WHAT IS THE FUNCTION OF SLEEP IT'S STILL VERY HARD TO KNOW WHY WULD OWHAT IS THE REASON ORGANISMS HAVE TO GO OFF LINE FOR SO LONG YOU KNOW PEOPLE ASSUME ITS FOR REPAIR ASSUME ITS FOR LEARNING AND MEMORY ASSUME ALL KIND OF SUP BUT THERE IS REALLY NO CLEAR FUNCTION FOR SLEEPING THERE IS NO CLEAR FUNCTION FOR SLEEPING M IF YOU TOKE TO PEOPLE THERE ARE HYPOTHESES  WE ALL WE KNOWS THAT IF YOU DON'T SLEEP WE YOUR SAND IS VERY FRACTEN YOU GET MASTOP YOU AND YOU COULD DIE YOU RIGHT I MEAN IT IT'S REALLY BAD IF YOU DON'T SLEEP BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS THE FUNCTION WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THAT SLEEP HAVE GONE TO ORGANISMS THAT COULDN'T HAVE DONE WITH REST WHAT IF YOU JUST COULD REST WITHOUT SLEEPING JUST SIT DOWN AN REST WELL T MY LABS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER NOT THESE NON SLEEP DEEP REST PROTOCALS CAN COMPENSATE FOR FOR SLEEP IN NOT WOMEN ISLY SLEEP IS BETTER BUT MANY PEOPLE ARE NOT GOT GETTING THE SLEEP THAT THEY NEED BUT I BUT OQE SO AND IF PEOPLE ARE SENSING THAT SAMAR AND I ARE ABOUT TO START TALKING OVER EACH OTHER AND ARGUING THAT'S ALWAYS THE GO WHEN E LOUK RIGHT UNLIKE OTHER SCIENTISTS I INTERACT WITH WHEN SIMMER AND I GET TOGETHER IT'S CONSIDERS SUCCESSFUL CONVERSATION IF WE GET INTO A BIG FIGHT AND THE OW FOR A BIG MEAL WERE I PICK THE RESTAURANT OQE SO LET'S TALK ABOUT FOOD AND EATING AND APPETITE YOU HAD YET ANOTHER YES I I GREATLY ADMIRE YOUR YOUR SUCCESS IN IN THIS WAY YET ANOTHER INCREDIBLE DISCOVERY SHOWING THAT THEREARE DIRECTS OF DIRECT EXCUSE ME EFFECTS OF LIGHT ON APPETITE AND FEEDING BEHAVIOR TO MAY YOU COULD U SUMMARISE THOSE RESULTS AND O FOR AND HONESTLY THAT PAPER IS THE ONE THAT ALLOWED US TO COME WITH THE TRY PART TEY MOBLE BECAUSE WE WERE THINKING COMPLETELY WRONG ABOUT IT WE WANTID THIS EXPEREMENT IT IT BE FUN FOR YOUR AUDIENCE TO HEAR WHY WE STARTED THIS EXPERIMENT REMEMBER THAT WHEN WE DISCOVER THE IPIARGESEES WE FIGURED IF THEY ARE THE ONLY REA REALLY TO ENTRAN THE CIRCANDIN CLOCK THEN YOU COULD KILL THEM AND HAVE AN ANIMAL OPPOSITE TO THE ONE THAT WE SPOKE OR HUMAN OPPOSITE TO THE ONE THAT WE SPOKE ABOUT EARLY WERE INSTEAD OF HAVING NO PATERN VISION AND HALF CIRCADIUN FOT IN TRANMEN WE COULD PRODUCE AN ANIMAL THAT HALF PATERN VISION BUT NO CIRCANDING FORT IN TRAIN SA CIRCADIAN BLIND CIRCADIN BLIND BUT PATER SITED AND WE SUCCEEDED IN THAT THE PROBLEM WHEN YOU HAVE THESE ANIMALS WHICH I'VE TOLD YOU MANY TIMES ALREADY IS THAT THEY DON'T ADJUST TO THE DAY NIGHT YCLE SO DOING EXPERIMENTS ON THEM BECOME VERY COMPLICATED A WHAT IS THEIRE BEHAVIOUR LIKE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THESE CELLS ARE THEY WAKE IN THEN SLEEP THEY WA THINGIS DRIFT LIKE THE HUMANS WE'VE STOKE TO ITHINK THERE IN LOST VAGUS THEY KNOWE AR LER WORS BRE AC TE  DAY UP LATER EVERY NIGHT THEYL COME EITHER DEPEND THER O'CLOCK IF IT'S THE O'CLOCK IS SHORTER THEY COME IN EARLIER IF THEIR CLOCK IS LONGER THEY COME INTO THE REALY MASS THEY THEY REALLY DON'T ADJUSTICE IF THEY WERE IN THE WHILE THERE BE ELIMINATED IN I SEC TRIGT THEREIS NOWAY THIN SSO ME AND THE EGOSARTI TOKEAN WERE LIGKE WHAT IF WE USE NONE LIGHT IN TRAINING AGENT AND WHAT IS THE STRONGING MAN LIGHT IN TRAINING ASION FOO SO WE THOUGHT THAT THE LIGHT DEFECTIVE ANIMALS WELL HAVE MORE SENSITIVYTED TO FOOD AND TRAIN BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW MORE THAN ME THIS IS AN AREA THAT YOUE WORKED REALY WELL ON FOR VISION IF YOUR IMAGE BLIND YOUR HEARING AND AND SOM ATO SENSALLY GET IMPROVED RIGHT THE THE LACK OF VISION IMPROVES YOUR HEARING AND SENSATION BUT WE FOUND ACTUALLY THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE LIGHT SYSTEM ACTUALLY YOUR FEEDING ABI THE FOOD ABILITY TO INTRAINE THE ANIMAL GOST COMPLETELY TO THE GROUND COMPLETELY OPPOSITE TO WHAT WE PREDICTED SO LIHT VIEWING AND FEEDING BEHAVIOR ARE INTERACTING IN WAYS THAT SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER AND THAT'S WHY WE CAME WITH THE TRIPARTIT MOTO WE FIGURE IS DIFFERENT THAN SENSATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT WHEN YOU SENSE WITH VISION VISION AND HEARING INTER ACT BUT YOUR VISION IS A REAL FULL MORTALITY YOU WANT TO SEE THAT'S WHAT VISION WANT TO DO YOU WANT TO HEAR THAT'S WHAT HEARING WANT TO DO YOU WANT TO SENSE THAT'S WHAT SENSING ONE TO DO BUT FOR THE CIRCADIAN SYSTEM LIGHT FOOD ALL THES IN TRAINING ASION THEY SOMEHOW HAVE TO INTER ACT TO KEEP A COHERENT SYSTEM YOU DON'T JUST ASSUME IF YOU REMOVE LIGHT THIS ONE IS GING TO BE STRONGER KNO THEY NEED TO KNOW EACH OTHERS THE LIGHT INFORMS WHEN THE ANIMALS CAN NI EAT O WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS SO MUCH IS THAT YOU KNOW IN THE OTHER IN THE WORLD OUTSIDE OF SCIENCE IN WHICH I I DON'T REALL EXIST IN BUT THAT I I SEE A LOT OF THIS KIND OF WELLNESS YOU KNOW STOFF AT TIS ALL THIS MINE BODY INTEGRATION STUFF IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE PEOPLE VIEW THE BODY MORE AS A SYSTEM BY THE SYSTEM OF ORGANS THAT INTERACT AS OPPOSED TO THE WAY THAT STANDARD SCIENCE AND MEDICAL PROFESSION IS LIKE YOU WART ON THE LIVER OR YOUR OUR NOSE AND THROAT OR HARTEN LONG OR BRAIN ORTHAT'S A REALER WAY OF THINKING YOU BUT THE BIOLOGY IS INTEGRATED Y AM IN AND SO FOR SOMEBODY WHOSE INTERESTED IN AFFECTING THEIR EATING BEHAVIOR SOMETHING THAT YOUR FAMILIAR WIT AND THAT WE WILL TALK MORE ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES OF IN A MOMENT HOW SHOULD THEY USE LIGHT IN ORDER TO ADJUST THEIR EATING BEHAVIOR SO NOW THAT I'VE TOLD YOU ABOUT ALL THIS INTERACTION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT IMPUTS OE CIR CANDIN CLOCK JUST YOU THINK ABOUT IT AS AN ENGINEER WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST THING THE BEST THING IS TO KNOW WHEN YOUR FOOD TIMES HAPPEN IN THE DAY WHEN SHOULD YOU GET LIGHT AND WHERE IS YOUR CIRCAT WHEN IS YOUR CIRCANDIN CLOCK IN YOUR SYSTEM RIGHT SO IF YOU EAT AT VERY SPECIFIC TIMES OF THE DAY THAT'S ANOTHER SIGNAL THAT IS TELLING YOUR BODY YOUR CLOCK YOURE IN A CERTAIN TIME OF THE DAY SO IF YOUR HAVING LUNCH AT THE GRECT TIME EVERY DAY AND YOU'RE GETTING BRIGHT LIKE NOW YOU HAVE TOO SYSTEMS THAT ARE INFORMING YOU O'CLOCK YOUR O'CLOCK IS GET TO BE BETTER SO REGULAR MEAL TIME REGULARLY MEAN TILES THATS FIT YOUR CIRCATIAN CLOCK SO AND IN FACT IF YOU DO THAT WHEN WHEN I STARTED DOING THIS AND IT HELP ME LOSE WAY IS THAT I'M EXPOSING MYSELF TO THE RIGHT AMOUNT O FLY DARCYCLE I'M EATING AT REGULAR TIME IT IS AMAZING YOU'D BE NOT HUNGRY LE SALE SA YOU EAT AT NOON YOU WILL NOT FEEL ANY HUNGER AT THE LIVIN FORTY FIVE AND THEN ALL OF SOME THE HUNGER JUST THIS IS CLEARLY NOT AN ENERGATION BECAUSE THIT COULD NOT BE THAT DRASTY I KNOW THE DESIRE TO EAT IS MAINLY DRIVEN BY THESE I THESE CUSLES HORMON CUS THAT ARE VERY EXQUISITELY TIME TO EXACT SLEEP WAKE CYCLE BUT ALSO TO LIGHT EXACTLY  AND YOU KNOW IN THE WHILE YOU COULD IMAGINE WHY ENERGY LEFT US THROUGH THE ACCURATE IS ARCUAT YOU CATION EXPLAIN THE PEOPLE WHAT THE ARCUATE IS CAUSE I DON'T THINK WE'VE DONE THAT ADEQUATELY THE ARCUENT NEW CLACEIS AN AREA OF THE HYPOTHALEMIS THAT DRIVES HUNGER AND FEEDING BEHAVIOR AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE FACT THAT IT'S TAKING CUS FROM YOUR VIEWING OF LIGHT BELIEVE IT OR NOT IS IMPACTING YOUR LEVEL OF HUNGER AND A THIS IS A A NONTRIVIAL WAY IN WHICH YOU'RE TIMING OF HUNGER AND AMOUNT OF HUNGER IS REGULATED BY WHEN AND HOW MUCH LIGHT YOU VIEW SO LET ME ASK YOU A COUPLE PRAAN I JUST THIS IS REALLY BEFORE ASKE ME ASORY ANDRO WI SULD EGAN AFIE BUT TO ME IS IS THE THE INTERESTING THING TO THINK ABOUT IT IN THE WHILE WHEN YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT VILIBLITY OF FOOD THAT WE HAVE THE ARCUIT PLAZING YUSU IMFORTANTROL BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT IF YOU WEREN'T SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING FOOD THEN THE ARCIS GAN I TELL YOU LOOK YOU HAVE TO TAKE RISK AND GO GET FOOD BECAUSE YOUR ENERGY LEFTEL IS VERY LONG AND THAT'S GREAT THAT TUMS OF GREAT RESERT ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK WHAT'S MISSING IS THE FACT IN HUMANS WEN NOT GETTING TO A SITUATION MOST OF US WER NOT GETTING TO A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE LO ENERGY LEVELS MOST OF THE TIME ACTUAL WE EAT NOT BECAUSE WE WANT TO BECAUSE WE ARE REALLY HAVE LO ENERGY BUT BECAUSE WE WANT TO EAT SO I THINK THAT'S WHY I FEEL THAT THE TIMING IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US BECAUSE WE ALWAYS HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY LEV FOR OSTRY WI MAY I ENJOY EATING SO MUCH THAT I'LL EAT JUST FOR THE SENSATION OF CHEWING THRU I MAY I I ENJOY THE TASTE TOO AND I ENJOY THE SOCIAL ASPECTS AN TOSER ARE A PART OF IT BUT I I LITTERALLY ENJOY THE PHYSICAL APS ON CHEWING ABSOLUTELY AH WHICH EXPLAINS A LOT AM OK SO HOW REGULAR ARE YOU WAR DO YOU RECOMMEND PEOPLE BE ABOUT MEAL TIMES BECAUSE WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT LIGHT VIEWING BEHAVIOUR IS PRETTY STRAIGHT FOR GET A LOT OF LIGHT IN THE MORNING AND THROUGHOUT THE DAY MINAMIZE IT IN THE EVENING AND AT NIGHT GENERALLY SPEAKING FORSAKE OF MOOD INCIRCATEN RHYTHAM BUT FORSAKE OF REGULATING TIMING AND QUALITY I I SHOULD ALSO SAY OF FOOD IN TAKE BECAUSE PEOPLE CLEARLY MAKE BETTER CHOICES ABOUT FOOD IN TAKE WHEN THEY AR ANTICIPATING A MEAL AND THEY AREN'T CONSTANTLY HUNGRY AND SO THE ABILITY TO REGULATE HUNGER FOR PARTICULAR PHASES OF THE CIRCADIAN CYCLE IS IS QUITE VALUABLE FOR ALL PEOPLE NOT JUST PEOPLE TRYING TO LOOSE WIHT BUT ALL PEOPLE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT DOWN TO THE MINUTE LIKE A INETLY IGHT PLUSER SO TWELVE NOON IS MY NORMAL LUNCH LET'S SAY A PLUER MINESS HALF AN HOUR BOOK SO EAT AROUT BETWEEN ELEVEN THIRTY AND TWELVE THIRTY IF IF THAT'S THE TIME AND INDEPENDS IF YOU ALSO DO MULTIPLE MEALS REMEMBER TITE MEALS THAT'S DECISION THAT SOMEBODY CAME UP WITH I DON'T KNOW WHY NOWADAYS PEOPLER FEWER PEOPLE ARE DOING THAT NOW I YOU ANG OUR FRIEND SUCH AAND AS WORE RIH I MEAN SO YOU COULD HAVE TWO MEALS YOU COULD HAVE VERY MULTIPLES MEALS NAT OR DISTRIBUTED ACROSS YOUR ACTIVE TIME I I AGREE WITH SUCH IS FOUND US WORK THAT TRY TO AVOID EATING WHEN YOUR SYSTEM IS SUPPOS TO BER AXING WHEN YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A NOT ACTIVE TIME SO YOU KNOW LIMIT YOUR EATING TO THE ACTIVE TIME IF YOUR AF YOUR CYCE AND THAT SEEM TO BE AN JORTO CASHIS DOING SOME BEAUTIFUL STUFF ON NESS THAT SEEM TO BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR A ASPECT OF THE CIRCADAN AND FOR HEALTH AND FOR THE I MEAN SUCH IN I WERE REFERRING TO SUCH AN PAND AS WORK YOU WROTE A BEAUTIFUL BOOK CALLED THE CIRCADIAN CODE MAYBE SAMMER WITH WITH SOME LUCK YOU'LL WRITE A BOOK AS WELL AM MEANING THE WORLD WOULD BE LUCKY TO HAVE THAT BOOK A BUT SUCH INS DAT A REALLY STRONGLY POINT TO THE FACT THAT LIVER HEALTH BRAIN HEALTH METABOLIC FACTORS AND INDICRANT FACTORS AND IN O VERY SYSTEMS AND ORGANS ALL SEEM TO BENEFIT FROM HAVING A PERIOD OF EACH TWENTY FOUR HOUR DAY AND WHICH WE ARE NOT EATING ANYTHING AND THEN EATING AT VERY REGULAR SOMETIMES LET'S TALK ABOUT EATING AN MEAL TIMES AND LET'S MOVE A LITTLE BIT AWAY FROM THE THE SCIENCE FOR THE MOMENT ALTHOUGH WE WILL RETURN TO IT AND TALK A LOTL BIT MORE ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE A WITH EATING AND MEAL TIMES SO A YOU LOOK IT IN GOOD SHAPE LATELY THANK YOU I KNOW YOUVE BEEN PUTTING WORK IN TO IT YET WE TALK A LOT AND YOU'V BEEN EXERCISING AND YOU'VE BEEN A BE EATING WELL MEANING QUALITY FOOD YOUSH CAME BACK FROM JORDAN WHERE AND ASSUMING THE FOOD IS AMAZEMINT IT'S THE FOOD IS AMAZING AND HONESTLY USUALLY I GAIN AN OIFWEIGHT IN JORDAN BUT THIS TIME I IN GAIN ANY WEIGHT WHICH WAS READY NICE OR YET YOU'VE YOU'VE D WHEN I MET YOU YOU WERE PROBABLY ABOUT  HUNDRED POUNDS HEAVIER THAN YOU ARE NOW A TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE POUNDS OF TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN NO IT'S GRAVEOU HAD A LOT OF VIGGER THAN IN YOUAVE A LOT OF VIGOR NOW BUT I KNOW THAT YOU UNDERTOOK A VERY SPECIFIC PROTOCAL IN ORDER TO LOSE THE WAY BASED ON YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE CIRCADIAN SYSTEM MEN OF LIGHT AND APPETITE AND MOOD A MAYBE YOU COULD JUST TELL US ALIO BIT ABOUT WHAT THAT SCADUAL LOOKS LIKE AND WE REALIZE THAT THIS IS NOT A PRESCRIPTIVE FOR EVERYBODY BUT YOU FOUND WHAT WORKED FOR YOU MAY BE JUST DESCRIBE THOSE AND WEOLOSY I FOLLOWED MY CIRCADIAN CYCLE RIGHT AF WEWHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT RI SO I DID THELIGHT AT NIGHT I SLEPT AT REGULAR OURS I AT MY MEASURE FOOD IN BREAKFAST ON LAUNCH WHEN IAM REALLY ACTIVE AND AM REALLY HUNGRY AND AT NIGHT WHEN I AVOID DINNER BECAUSE MY CIRCADIN SYSTEM REALLY SHUTS OFF AT THREE I'M AN EARLY PERSON LIKE YOU COULD GIVE ME ANYTHING I WOULD EAT BEFORE THREE AFTER THREE NOTHING APPEALS TO ME ANY MONE MY SYSTEM IS SHUT OFF BUT WHAT TIME ARE YOU GOING TO SLEEPING WHAT I ME WA ALSO AN MY CISES I SHOULD HAVE PUT THIS I MAY I GO TO SLEEP LITERALLY AT NINE A NINE P M I MEAN I LITERALLY FIVE MINUTES AFTER NINE P M I'M COMPLETELY OUT AND I WAKE UP BETWEEN FOUR THIRTY AND FIVE  M SO IF I EXTENDED I GOTO SIX A M BUT VERY REARELY DEFENSE OF HOW TIRED I WAS AND THAT AS I RECALL WAS IN IMPORTANT SET OF CHANGES FOR YOU I BE ABLE TO REGULATE YOUR FOODINS ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE THEN I'M HAVING VERY BIG BREAKFAST AT AND AGAIN FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE AS DIFFERENT I HAVE A BIG BREAKFAST AT SEVEN A M MAXIMUM SO I HAVE A BIG BREAKFAST COFFEE AND ALL TE STUFF THEN I HAVE SOME SIMPLE SNARK AROUND TEN THEN I HAVE REGULARLY LUNCH AT NOON OR BETWEEN NOON TO ON THEN I HAVE ANOTHER SNACK AT THREE AND THE HARDEST TIME TO REGULATE THE FOOD IS BETWEEN TWELVE AND THREE THIS IS ONE AM I REALLY FEEL HUNGRY OISLEOR EQUIVALENT OF KIND OF LATE EVENING FROM US YES SO THOR ME WUD PALLY BETWEEN SEVEN AND TEN P EXACTLY ORACTLY AND THEN AT NIGHT AM AM COMPLETELY NOT HUNGRY BUT USUALLY AS YOU SAID THE BUDEAU THE THE ENJOYMENT OF FOOD LIKE WHEN MY WIFE KIKS COOK SOME REALLY BEAUTIFUL INDIAN FOOD I EAT BUT I'M NOT HUNGRY AND I NOTICE IF I EAT WITH THAT I USUALLY GAIN WAT BUT IF I REGULATE THAT AT NIGHT I ALSO LOOSE WAT SO THERE IS A COMBINATION OF ALL THESE THINGS THAT HELP YOU A JUST TIS THIS DA TA THE IMPUT OF FOOD THAT IM PUT O FLI IN PUT OF THE CLOCK AND THE DRIVE TO HUNGER YE I APPRECIATE YOU SHARING THAT TEND AND I WON'T EMPHASISED THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT HUNGRY EARLY IN THE DAY THEY MIGHT BE LATE SHIFTED PEOPLE AND WHICH CASE EATING LATER IN THE DEY W W WORK WELL WORK AS LONG AS THEY DON'T EAT EARLY IN THE MORNING THAT'S JUST YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH YOUR SCADUL WITH YOUR ACTIVE CADU YE YOU NOT BEEN TALKING BOUT THIS AWFULINE FOR YEARS IAM GLAD WO'RH FINALLY HAVING THIS DISCUSSION PUBLICLY NOW WE WERE TALKING OUT REALLY IS FINDING YOUR IDEAL SLEEPS CADUAL EXACTLY ENS A FINDING YOUR IDEAL EATING SCATRE EXACTLY AND UNDERSTANDING HOW THOSE TWO THINGS INTERACT AND DO YOU KNOW THE NICE THING AS YOU SAID FINDING THEM OUT IS GOING HELP YOU TO UNDE SANT HAU DE INTERACT BECAUSE WE KNOW FROM THE TRY PARTET MO THAT THEY ARE ALL INTERCONNECTED AND FOR EACH PERSON THEY CAN A BE INTERCONNECTED DIFFERENTLY SO FOR EACH PERSON YOU WOULD ER O FOR ME IF I EXERCISE AT NIGHT 'M GAN A MISS UP MY WHOLE SYSTEM BELWEND YOU EXERCISE MORNING MORNING WORKS CRAT FOR ME I MEAN IT'S AMAZING MORNING EXERCISE FOR ME WORKS GREAT IF I TRIED ONE TIME BECAUSE IT WAS EASIER FOR ME TO EXERCISE AT NIGHT BEFORE I LEAVE WHEN THE TRAFFIC IS THEREFOR THAT I SIAN I THINK THAT MISS ME OUP BECAUSE I COULD SLEEP WELL AND I COUN WAKE UP WELL AND THAT LIT TO MORE CHANGES MY WOO I GIN'T WAIT AGAIN ACTUALLY BELIEVE IT OR NOT EVEN THOUGH I WAS EXERCISING SO I THINK THIS REALLY MAKES ME THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO THINK OF THE TRYPARTAT MOBLE TO SLEEP WHERE IS THE BEST TIMES AND WHAT IS THE BEST INTERRELATION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT COMPONENT AS YOU BEAUTIFULLY SAID TWEEN YOUR MEAL TIMES YOUR LIGHT EXPOSURE AND YOUR SLEEP THAT WORKS FOR YOU YOU WILL THANK YOU THAT USUALLY SERMERS IN SALTING ME TO DAY HE'S COMPLIMENTING ME OF ANY COMPLIMENT IN RIGHT BACK BY SAYING I THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I'VE EVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD HOW YES LI CAN CONTROL SLEEP YESICAN IN CONTROL MOOD YES I CAN IN PACT FEELING BUT THAT IT'S REALLY ABOUT DOING THE SELF EXPLORATION TO A LINE THOSE IN THE WAY THAT WORKS BAST IN WHAT IAM HEARING TELL ME FROM WRONG BUT WHEN IAM HEARING IS THAT ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT GIVES YOU THE BEST SLEEP WAKE CYCLE THEN YOU SHOULD EXERCISE DURING THE PERIOD OF TIME IN WHICH YOU FEEL MOST ALERT EN IF IT WORKS FOR YOUR SCADUAL I DEALLY YOU WOULD ALSO EAT DURING THE TIME IN WHICH YOU FEEL MOST ALERT AND THEN STOP EATING AND STOP LIKE LERING BEHAVIOUR AS YOU HAD TOWARDS SLEEP  SO THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY THAT COMPLICATES ALL OF THIS AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME SAD IS YOUR LIGHT EXPOSURE MIND PERSONAL SO  OU S THAT THE PEOPLE'S LIGHT EXPOSOU RIGHT THIS IS WHAT COMPLICATES IT BECAUSE YOU'R NOT GING TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE ALL THIS OUT IF YOU'RE SHIFTING YOURSELF OUT OF YOUR COMFORTS ON BY VIEWING BY VIEARING LIGHT AT THE WRONG TIMES THE DAY SO LET'S SAY LHIS SAY YOU'RE IF YOU WERE UNDER AN IDLE NATURAL CONDITIONS YOUR PERSON WHO WOULD SLEEP LATER THAN ME LET STEY WILL SLEEP AT MIDNIGHT AND WAKE UP AT IGHT A M THIS SAY YOU DON'T EAT ANYTHING TILL NOON AND AS YOU SAID YOU EAT LATE IN THE EVENING THEN THIS WOULD BE PERFECT FOR YOU BUT NOW SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU NOW YOU INCLUDE THE LIFE COMPONEN NOW IF YOU PUSH YOUR SLEEP FROR MIDNIGHT BEFORE I M NOW YOUR WAKING UP IN THE MORNING AND YOU' YOU'RE ACTUALLY REALLY NOT THE MORNING YOUR WORKING UPSOR AT NOON INSTEAD OF EIGHT O'CLOCK AND THE TIME WERE YOU NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HUNGRY NOW YOU GET A START EATING DIRECTLY AT MOON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR EVEN DELAYI AND NOW YOU SHIFTING YOUR WHOLE SYCLE AND YOU DON'T KNOW IF THIS INTERACTION BETWEEN YOUR SLEEP FEEDING AND THE LIGHT DARK ENVIRONMENT I'LL SLEEPN NI BE MENTAINED OR ISES AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT PEOPLE HAV SO MO YOU KNOW AS I'M HEARING THAS WHAT I M REALIZING IS MOST OF US PROBLY ME INCLUDED AR MESSING UP AT LEAST ONE TWO OR THREE OF THESE COMPOGA BUT THAT THE THAT THE THE PROBE THE WAY TE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S RIGHT FOR ONESELF IS TO START MANIPULATING LIGHT EXPOSURE  AND IM I'M GING A BE HONEST AM BIAS CAUSE I BELIEVE THAT LIFE IS THE STRONGER IS THE STRONGEST TIME GIVEN AND WE LOT OF PEOPLE DISAGREE SOME PEOPLE THINK FEEDING IS I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT LIGHT WAS THE PRIMARY ZIT GIVER THE PRIMARY YA LAT LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT'S FOOD LOT OF PEOPLE EVEN SOMETIMES MENTION SOCIAL INTER ACTTHEY READ THE LITERATURE I I AGREE WITH YOU I I TOLTE TAT YU AMIT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT LIGHT IS THE MOST POWERFUL DRIVER OF THE THINGS FOR THAT'S A I THINK WE NEED TO REGULATE THIS FIRST AND EVERYTHING ELSE FITS AND YOU KNOW THE NICE THING IS THAT YOU SLEEP WE EXCYCLE AND EXERCISE TELL YOU REALLY BLUNTLY IF YOUARE DOING A TRIT OR NOT TELL ME MORE ABOUT THAT I TELL YOU MORE WHEN I SHIFTED MY EXERCISE HONESTLY THINKS FELL UPOR LIKE NEVER BEFORE WHEN YOU MOVED FROM EXERCISING EARLY IN THE T TE MORNIN TH YA IT COMPLETELY FILL UP ART FOR ME I DIDN'T ENJOY EXERCISE THAT NIGHT MY PAN TOLENCS FOR EXERCISE WAS A ASWUD I'M TALKING WITH AN EQUALS ONE D I'M AWARE OF THIS AV NEVER TESTED THIS EMPERICALLY BUT AT LEAST TO ME IT REALLY MISSED UP EVERYTHING I START AN HAVING PROMBICAUS MY BUDY TEMPERATURE WOULD GO UP AND THAT WELL AFFECT MY SLEEP BY POSSIBLY WAS RUNNING IN THE GIM WITH LOW OF LIGHTS SOR MAYBE THE LIGHT WAS A COMBONAN BUT FOR ME EXERCISING IN THE MORNING IT'S SO MUCH BETTER FOR ME BUT LOT OF PEOPLE CAN'T EVEN THINK OF EXERCISING THE MORNING SO IT DEPENDS ON WHEN YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE IN YOUR SLEEP WEXCYCLE AND YEUR EXERCISE I THINK THAT TELLS YOU IF YOUR SISTEM IS IN IN SINKRIY WITH ONE A THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING YOUR I WE WERE GOOD FRIENDS ARE OUR FRIEND PAT DASIT ETHER WE BOTH NOW YODID NINE YEARS AND SILL TEAMS AND HE'S ONE OF THESE PEOPLE SAYS YOU KNOW HE'S HAPPY TO HE GO FOR RUNNERS WHEN ANY TIME BETWEEN FOUR THIRTY I M AND SIX I M AN HY OLL TRAIN IN THE AFTERNOON TOO CAUS ENARIS SEALTING GUIN NOT TO WHATEVER ANY TIME THAT'S PART OF THE FINA TYPE BUT HE FEELS BEST DOING THAT RIGHT I'M AMID I LIKE EXERCISE MIDMORNING AND I'M HAPPYTO SKIP EATING UNTIL TWELVE OR ONE  AND I LIKE TO GO TO SLEEPER OUN ELEVEN THIRTY TWELVE CAUSE I'M A NORMAL HUMAN BEING RATHER THAN YOU WHO GOES TO BED AT NAABO YO AT ACTUALLY IV NEVER ASKIN WHAT RAT SO PEATS I DEAL TO SLEEP TIME I'VE ASKED IN THIS WE BE AROUND EIGHT THIRTY OR NINE OSE NA A NOVER YES YES BUT HE HAS A TWO YOUNG CHILDREN TWO YEARS OLD AND A NEW BORN AND SO THE CYCLE IS DESTRUP A THAT'S NO RIHT I MEAN THAT THE EFFECT OF CHILD BERY AND I  THINK THER WE COULD TALK ABOUT THIS THAT'S MORE COMPLICATED BUT THAT'S PRETTY PRETTY MUCH I YE I M I THINK WE NEED TO COME UP WITH A NEW NAME FOR A CRONOTYPE BECAUSE CHRONICIREAL IMPLIES THERE I'S JUST ABOUT SLEEP AND WAKE IBEING AN EARLY BURDER A NIGHT OWL AND WHAT WERE ALSO TALKING ABOUT IS HOW EXERCISE AND EATING MATCH ON TO THOSE AND THE FAS RELATION RAN THE PHASES BETWEEN FROM COMPONES AS YOU SAID CAUSE THEY INTERRAT BECAUSE THEY INTRI RIGHTAND THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE IN THE SAME FACE LIKE LET'S SAVE MY LIGHE AND FOOD COULD BE VERY CLOSE T EACH OTHERS YOUR LIFE AND FOOD COULD BE DIFFERENT RIGHT THE FASES DON'T HAVE TO B T CANT BE PLASTING SO YOU HAVE TO FIND THIS FOR YOURSELF YOU MAY YOU MAY BE A PERSON WHO EATS LATE AT NIGHT EXERCISES LATE AT NIGHT OR YOU MAY BE A PRESON OF EXERCISE EARLY EAT LATER SO IT DOESN'T AS LONG AS THE FASE IS IS GOOD THAT'S WHAT YOU THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT AND IF I UNDERSTAND CRECTLY WHEN YOU TIME AT FASE RELATIONSHIP IT MEANS YOU WANT TO LUMP EXERCISE FEEDING AND LIGHT FOR ANDSLEEP AND SLEEP IN A WAY THAT AS I COHERENT AND TOTAL SYSTEM MAKES YOU FEEL REALLY GOOD TEMPORALLY IN GREAT ORDER ABSOLUTE YA THAT'S AND I THINK THAT AT I COULD TELL YOU TO ME IS LITERALLY GETTING EXPOSED TO SOM YOU KNOW CLEARLY IN THE MORNING CLEARLY AT NOON I GO OUT I KEEP MY WINDOWS IN THE OFFICE COMPLETELY OPEN EATING MOSTLY IN THE EARLY TIME OF THE DAY AND EXERCISING AND LITERALLY AT THE END PART OF THE DAY A'M LITERALLY IN A MORE THOUGHTFUL VEGETATIVE STATE LIKE I REALLY CAN'T LIKE A AFTER FIVE I TELL MY STUENCE IF YOU WANT O TELL ME ANYTHING COMPLICATED YOU WASTING YOUR TIME MY BRAIN JUST DOESN'T FUNCTION SO EVEN THOUGH I ONLY SLEEP AT NIGHT BUT I'M REALLY STARTING TO SHUT OFF RAM DOWN REALLY I MEAN IT'S YOU KNOW I COULD SEND E MAL TOK ABOUT BRAINLESS STUFF BUT MY POWER MY ENERGY TO TO DO POWERFUL STUFF TREALLY DROP TREMENDOUSLY SO ALL MY STUDENTS WHO KNOW ME FERY WHILE THEY PUT THE MEETINGS WITH ME EARLY IN THE MORNING CASE THEY NOTICES WENT ON SO EVERYTHINK FOR ME AND FOR ME IS VERY TIRED SO IT COULD BE DIFFERENT FROM TIS VERY CLUSTER IN THE MORNING IS ALL TIED TOGETHER AND LITERALLY THE REMAINING PART SEEMS TO BE JUST DAY YOU NOT VEGETATIVE STING YET YOU AND MY A BODAG CASTELLA WHO UN FORTUNIN PASS AWAY RECENTLY AND THAT IN A DID NOT THAT A SELLAN CAS ALLOWERE GOOD FRIENDS YEHAS SORRY TO BREAK IT TO YOU WITH A HERE YA HE HE HAD A GOOD LONG LIFE AND HE HE WENT EASY BUT HE HAD A CIRCADIAN CLOCK THE BASING WICH A SLEEP AROUND TWENTY FOUR HOURS O DAY AN MINAMAL ACTIVITY INTERSPERSED EVERY THIRD DAY OR SO AN YOU DO HAVE THIS MORNING VIGOR YES AND THAT I'M THAT I THINK OTHER PEOPLE CAN HAVE MORE OF AN AFTERNOON VICOR DO YOU THINK THAT THIS CAN CHANGE ACROSS THE LIFE SPEND THAT IT'S THA THE RUMOR IS THAT TEEN AGERS NATURALLY WANT TO SLEEP IN LATER AND STAY UP LATER DO YOU THINK THAT SOCIAL WITHM OR DO YOU THINK THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY BY LARGE YEET THAT'S A TOUGH QUESTION I MEAN THAT IT IT IT COULD BE BOTH ONE THINKS WITHAT WORDS MEANS THAT IT SEEMS THAT IF ANYTHING WITH AGE THIS MORNING RIT RIGOR GETS STRONGER SEEN YOU ANT PEOPLE BECOME MORE OF MORNING MORE OR WISE I WERE YOU I THINK THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE FOR ME A'M ALREADY A VERY SHIFTED MORNING I DON'T WANT A BESE ONE OF THES SEVEN P M TO WONE  M SLEEPERS AT SOME POINT N ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S IT'S ALSO CONE A NICE BECAUSE IT'S QUIET IN YOU CAN GET YA BUT HONESTLY FROM FOUR THIRTY TO SEVEN THIRTY IN MY WIFE WAKE UP IT'S IT CAN BE VERY LONG YES YOURE CHIEF LAT BUT IT'S QUITE OUTSIDE IT'S YU KNOW SO IT II I DON'T WANT TO BE AT ONE  THI WITI TIS I DON'T CON TELL SAMER IS MORE SOCIAL THAN I AM THAT'S IAN THAT IS TRUE SO YOU ON SHOULD TOUCH ON THAT ACTUALLY SO SO YOUR WIFE IS SHE FOLLOWS A DIFFERENT SCADUAL YA AND AND SO A SOCIAL ITHIN IS IMPORTANT LET I THINK BUT WHAT SHOULD WE DO HOW SHWE CONCEPTIOALISES AND HOW SHOULD WE AJUST OURSELVES ACCORDING TO THE SOC ND I HONESTLY LOVE THIS THIS THIS HYPOTHESES THAT PEOPLE CAME UP WITH AN AND PATS KIDS REMINDED ME OFF BECAUSE KIDS ARE REALLY GAN A TE SLUP YOUR SLEEP WEEKS ICL IT SEEMS LIKE THEREO SAY GRONO ATTRACTION THAT USUALLY PEOPLE WHO ATTRACT EACH OTHERS HAVE ACTUALLY DIFFERENT SLEEP WAKES CATUOL AND THE IDEA BEING IS THAT THIS ALOSS TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR KIDS THROUGH OU TE TININES ICLANDS HAVE A PEACEFUL MARIT AND HAVE THESE VOMARISHIN TOI SO I ME READEN HAF GIVS ME OUTRAGEOUS OR MAY BE THIS IS BUT IT SEEMS LIKE EVOLUSIONY MAKE SENSE THAT IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT YOUR PROTECT YOUR KIDS YOU DON'T WANT EVERYBODY TO BE MORNING GRIGGER AND THAN THE KIDS DON'T HAVE SO YOU WANT THE DISTRIBUTED ASI AT SAY AN IT'S A REASONABLE ARGUMENT I HEARD THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE THINK THAT THE CLOCK IS NOT EXACTLY TWENTY FOUR HOURS BUT IS TWENTY FOUR HOURS PLUSSER MINUS YOU KNOW TWENTY MINUTES OR SO IS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT WE EVOLVED IN CLANS OR GROUPS VILLAGES WHATEVER THAT WERE ABOUT A HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE AND IN ORDER TO HAVE PROTECTION AROUND THE EARLY MORNING HOURS WHEN WEE IAR ONTEPREDATION AND IN THE LATE NIGHT HOURS THAT YOU WOULD WANT SOME INDIVIDUALS OF OF OUR SPECIES TO BE NATURALLY MORE LIKE NIGHT HOULS AND SOME MORE LIKE EARLY PEOPLE SO YOUR I'M THEORY OF PARENTING IS UM IS SIMILAR IN THAT WAY I THE SOCIAL RHYTHM IS IS A POWERFUL RHITHEM THOUGH MEANING IF I GO OUT AND I'M TIRED LET US SAY I'M TIREDLY NINE THIRTY A DON'T ONE A GO OUT LI CNANLYTIS SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THAT I THINK THE SOCIAL WITHM IS POWERFUL AT THE OBVIOUS LEVILS LIKE IT AFFECTS YOUR SLEEP IT AFFICTS HOW MUCH YOU WAKE UP OR ET BUT I'M NOT SO SURE IS AS POWERFUL AS PEOPLE THINK ON THE CLOKNOW EVENTUALLY TWIL MESS UP THE CLOCK BECAUSE NOW IF YOUR DOING A LAW OF SOCIAL AT NIHE GETTING IN A FLITE EATING AT THE RONG TIME OF THE DAY EVENTUALLY YOU CANNOT HAVE AN EFFECT BUT I DON'T THINK THUS THE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS THEMSELF HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO AFFECT YOUR CLOCK VERY SLONLY FOR SOME REASON THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW WEL IM FOR BE HEARING THIS THE PROLY GETTING THE IMPRESSION LIKE I'M THE NIGHT OWL AND THEN SAMER IS THE ONE IT'S IN BED AT NINE AND THEN A YOU KNOW WAKES UP AT FOUR BUT HAVING ATTENDED MANY MEETINGS WITH SAMURI CAN TELL YOU THAT HE'S THE PARTY ANIMAL SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT I MEAN LE'ST TALK ABOUT THE FAT THE YEAR H O THE PARTIER IF WE'S UP UNTIL TWO DANCING AT THESE AT THESE VARIOUS MEETINGS WHICH I'VE SEEN HAVE AASHI GOOD DANCER I'M TOLD BUT WHAT SHOULD WE DO WHEN WE DO STAY U VERY LATE FOR WHATEVER REASON COULD BE BECAUSE WE HAD TO TAKE MIDNIGHT TRIP TO THE HOSPITAL THAT UNFORTUNATE REASON OR COURD BE BECAUSE YOU ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF PEOPLE THAT YOU DON'T SEE VERY OFTEN AND YOU A AND YOU GO OUT FOR A REALLY NICE NIGHT OUT ON THE TOWN AND YOU AND YOU GET TO SLEEP ROUND TWO THIRTY OR THREE IN THE MORNING HOW SHOULD ONE GET BACK ON SCADUL DO YOU FORCE YOURSELF TO THEN GET UP AN I VYIOU LIGHT AT THE NORMAL TIME THAT YOU WOULD GET UP IN VYOU LIKE ORDER YOU ALLOW YOURSELF TO SLEEP IN WHAT WHAT'S THE OPTOMO I WOULD ALLOW MYSELF TO SLEEPING AND REMEMBER THIS IS A LONG TERM IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU LIVE WITH FOR A LONG PERIOD AND AND REMEMBER I TOLD  ABOUT THE EXPERENTS WE DID WITH THE MOD THESE REQUIRE TWO WEEKS OF THAT LIGHTS CADUL TO CAUSE M MOD DISTURBANCES SO THESE DON'T HAPPEN JUST IN SINGLE DAY SO THIS IS THE WAY YOU JUSTIFY STAYING OUT LATE EVERY ONE SO WELL IN THAT THE MEETINGS YOUV SEEN ME HAVE DONE THIS FOR FIVE OR SIX DAYS CONTINUOUSLY BUT WHAT YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT WHEN I CAME BACK TO MY HOME IT TOOK ME TWO WEEKS AS IF I DID E JETLAK SO I REALLY DO SUFFER FOR TWO WEEKS AFTER DOING THE SIX CRAZY ART OF STAYING UP AT NIG DRINKING AT THE ROOM TIM OF THE DAY SO IT'S NOT THAT A COMPLETELY OL CARE WITH IT WHEN I GO BACK EVERYTHING GOES BACK IT TAKES ME ACTUALLY LITERALLY TWO WEEKS TO RECOVER FROM THE CIR CADE RITHE MEETING THAT YOU SEEN ME PARTING A A AT SOME POCES CAND OF IRONICA SIRCALING I KNO RATHE MANINT YOU GA TOLLY DESTRUCPING THE SERRIRIN SIER BUT A SCIENCESS IR HUMAN BEINGS TO RIN SO I I THINK IF YOU DO IT AT VERY LITTLE OCCASIONS I THINK YOU SHOULD NOT WORRY TOO MUCH THAT THIS WOULD HAVE LASTING IN PACT AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IF YOU REAJUST YOU SCADUL YOU COULD COME BACK WITH THE PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU MAINTAIND THESE WRONGS CADUL FOR PRONTI AND BECOMES CRONIC PROLONG PEERS OF TAM THAT'S WHEN YOU HAVE THE PROBLEMS AND THE ACCUMULATION OF THE PROBLEMS SO WHEN YOU HAVE SLEEPING PROBLEM YE PRODUCE METABLIC PROBLEMY HAVE THAULER PROBLEMS TO PRODUCE LACK OF EXERCISE AND YOU COULD SEE HOW THINGS CANSPIR OUT VERY QUICKLY AND THEN IT WOULD BE HARD TO COME BACK TO IT OR CERTAINLY SLEEP DISRUPTION IS BOTH A SYMPTOM OF AND YES A CAUSE OF ALMOST ALL ABSOLUT MENTAL HEALTH DISERVES RIGHT AND CERTAINLY THE METABOLICS AND GERUMS THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT NOWADAYS AND ALL OF THIS IT ALL FONALS BACK TO LIGHT THIS IS NOT SO REMARKABLE YES AND SO WE HAVE THESE DEVICES AND IM I USE MY PHONE AND I USE MY COMPUTER BUT DO YOU THINK THAT THE MERE DIMMING OF THE SCREEN OR NOT INTERACTING WITH SCREENS AFT YOU KNOW WITH IT SAY NINETY MINUTES OR TWO HOURS BEFORE BEDTIME ACCORDING TO WHAT WERE SAYING TO DAY THIS SHOULD HAVE A PROFOUND EFFACT AN IN DOT ALWAYS AND I REALLY BELIEVE IT DOS AND I YOU KNOW AGAIN I THINK ASPAT HAS J DID THES THIS TIS INVENTIONS WHERE YOU GET A POUCH WHERE YOU PUT YOU FON IN A PARCH ISO WHENT BY SAMMERS REFERRING TO IS OUR FRIEND PAT AM THIS A FOR MER SUILTY MEMBER THAT WE THAT I WAS ALSO VERY IMPRESSIVE PERSON IN LANDSCAPE OF BUSINESS AND FAMILY ET CETERA REAL A SUPERHUMAN FROM ABY ANY REGARD AM HAS THIS HABIT OF TAKING HIS PONE AND PUTTING INTO A SEAL POUCH YON EVENING SO IT' PASICALLY AND IN HIS WARA HE SENDS YOU ACTIALLY THESE THES SEA ONLY AN BATCHES AND AND SO THAT I THINK IS IS A GREAT IDEA BECAUSE NOT ONLY IT WUL TAKE AWAY THE LIGHT FROM YOU BUT IT ALSO TAKE AWAY THE DISTRACTION BECAUSE YOU WANNA REPAIR AND RECOVER AND SLEEP JUST THAT AND IF YOU HAVE YOUR FON DINGING ALL THE TIME OR OR THE LIGHE FLASHING FROM IT IS YOU JUST NOT GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP AND YOUR COSING YOURSELF MEASURE PROBLEMS I NEVER ASK YOU THIS BUT I REALIZSED NOW THAT I I SHOULD HAVE LONG AGO BUT I'LL ASK YOU NOW TWHYN HOW DID YOU GET INTO ALL THE STAFF YAH I MEAN HONESTLY I I FIRST OF ALL I WANTED TO BECOME A YOU NOW WANTED TO STUDY GENATICS AND I KNEW I WANTED TO DO PIGE THE INGENATICS BUT I ONLY GOT ECCEPT N ONE UNIVERSY AT THE TIME AND I JOINED THE LEARNING AND MEMORY LAV AND I LIKE LEARNING AND MEMORY AT THE BEGINNING I WORKED ON THE SNAILS ON A PLEASEYECARIFONICAN AND STARTED LOOKING AT LEARNING AND MEMORY BUT THEN THE SAME LAB WAS LOOKING AT THIS DAILY VARIATION I WAS REALLY STRARK LIKE YOU NEVER THINK ABOUT IT OUTSIDE THE SCIENCE IT REALLY STRUCK ME THAT ORGANISMS CAN MEASURE DAY BYLOGICALY THAT WAS VERY SHOCKING TO ME AND I JUST REALLY GOT ATTRACTED AND I WANTED TO SEE WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE AND I JUST STRUCK WITH IT IT JUST IT WAS MY BLOWING FOR ME WHO WAS IN MEDICAL SCHOOL THAT 'VE NEVER HEARD ABOUT IT BEFORE YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY AMAZING MEDICINE I THINK STILL NOW WE ARE VERY GOOD AT LOOKING AT STAFSPACIALLY BUT WER VERY BAD AT LOOKING AT TEMPORAL ASPECTS SO WE ALWAYS FEE NO LIKE TO SEE IMAGES STATIC IMAGES SPACIALLY INFOR ME I TAKEAN EXR I MEASURE AFTER MEASURABLE A PREXACTLY RAT WE DON'T THINK OF TEM POL AND AND YOU KNOW YOU TALK TO JON HOGENASH LIKE NOW AND IS TELLING YOU THE IMPORTANCE OF CRONO MEDICINE OR CRONA FORMAD FOME TO WHATEVER THE WORD IS AND IT JUST IT REALLY JUST GETTING THE THE DRUGS AT THE RIGHT TIME OF THE DAYS CAN BE ESENTIAL FOR OUR HEALT YOU THING THATS CANNO COME FROM USING BETTER TRACTERS LIKE AM OR ARRANGE WHOOPSTRAPS THESE CANDS I I LOVE THE TRACKERS BUT I THINK THEREIS EVEN MORE EXCITING DISCOVERIES NOW YOU COULD TAKE A SINGLE BLOOD SAMPLE AND MEASURE MANY BYOLOGICAL COMPONENTS AND FIGURE WHERE YOU ARE IN THE CIRCANDIN CLO SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY HARD TO DO BEFORE SO IF YOU HAVE I MARKER TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE IN THE CLOCK YOU COULD ACTUALLY UNDE STAND MORE THE EFFECT OF EVERYTHING EXERCISE FEELIN BLIGHTING POT WHAT IS THE MARKER SO THERE ARE SOME PAPERS FROM E I WHAT'S AN PHILIZE AND FROM A ATHIN CRAMER WERE THEY MEASURE MULTIPLE ARE INASE THAT UNKNOWN TO TELL YOU WHAT FACE OF THE CLOCK IS OR MULTIPLE E PROTEDES OR BIOLOGICAL REACTIONS AND DEPENDING ON E COMBINATION OF FACT THAT NOT A SINGLE FACT THAT YOU COULD TELL WHERE YOU ARE IN THE CIRCADAN CLOT SO THEY COULD INSTEAD OF JUST MEASURING TEMPERATURE OR MILATONI JUST ONE MEASUREMEN AND MILATONS SICLY IS ALSO COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT MILATON IS AFICTED BY LIGHT AND YOU KNOW AND TEMPERATURE YOUR TEMPERATURE AN SLEEP CAN BE EASILY DISSOCIATABE RIGHT WHEN YOU TRAVELAOS DIFFERENT TIMES WHEN YOUR SLEEP AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN THE TEMPERATURE CICL S HAVING MULTIPLE COMPONENTS MEASURE WILL GIVE YOU BETTER DETERMINATION OF YOUR CIRCADAN FASE AND UNDERSTANDING YOUR CIRCALIAN PASE IN HUMANS WE'LL TELL YOU WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF GIVING CERTAIN DRUGS AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE CIRCAVI FACE OR IN THE FUTURE THIS IS GOING TO BE STUDIED AT E MUCH HIGH LEVEL WHEN YOU CAN BETERM IN THE FASE IN RELATION TO OLD OTHER STAFF IT'S STRIKING TO ME THAT IN ALL ANIMALS BESIDES HUMANS IF THEY DEVIATE TOO MUCH FROM THE APPROPRIATE EXPOSURE TO LIGHT AND LIGHT DARK CYCLE THEY ESSENTIALLY DON'T MATE END OR DIE AND OR GET KILLED OFF BUT IN HUMANS WE ARE ABLE TO OVERRIDE THAT AT LEAST TO SOME EXTENT BUT THE WAYS IN WHICH WE SUFFER APPEAR TO BE THINGS LIKE OBECITY MENABOLICS INDRUMS AR RE PRODUCTIVE SINDRUMS THAT ARE ACCOMPANY THE OTHER CINDRUMS YOU O ENDERCON CYNDRUMS AND MOODAND DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS IS THERE ANY EFFORT AT THE LEVEL OF THE THE NATIONALLY OR RE LABORATORIES T YOUR WHERE OF TO TRY IN USE LIGHT IN ORDER TO IMPROVE MOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH I MEAN HONESTLY THIS IS MY MOUDO THIS IS THE THING THAT I THINK PEOPLE BECAUSE IT'S I I ISAY DON'T TAK YEOPILE TAKE A FORTON AND NOT A MAN YOU TAKE PILS THI IMPORTANT I AM JUST MAKING IT THAT REALLY WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNIT YOURAR RIGHT NOW WITH THE INCREDIBLE ADVANCES OF ELDY LIVES OF CHANGING SPECTROR FLIGHT OF REGULATING INTENSITIESE AND JUST TO ASSOI JUST AS FOR SIMPLE CHANGES YOU COULD REALLY IMPROVE SLEEP WAKES ICAL PROLACTIVITY AND STILL YOU COULD ACTUALLY GET MORE DONE BECAUSE AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THESE MESTAR NOW YOU HAVE TO SLEEP MORE BUT YOUR SLEEP IS FRAGMENT IT IS NOT VERY GOOD AND YOU CANT FOK AS N WEOUCANS AS LOCUS WEU DON'T HAVE ALERTNESS WHEN YOU NEED THE ALERTNESS SO HAVING ALL THESE YOU COULD ALLOW YOU TO DO EVEN MORE ACTUALLY ATD THE AND TANLESS AND THAT'S THAT THE EXCITING PART OF HIM ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I GET ASKED MOST OFTAN ABOUT IS ABOUT EIGHTY EIGHT TE YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF SELF PRESCRIBED AS WELL AS CLINICALLY PRESCRIBED EIGHTY EIGHTY PEOPLE R HAVING A TREMENDOUSLY DIFFICULT TIME FOCUSSING AND NOT JUST BECAUSE THEIR SLEEPY THEY JUST CAN'T SEEM TO ANCHOR THEIR ATTENTION AND THERE CAN BE MULTIPLE REASONS FOR THIS BUT THERE ARE NOW SEVERAL CLINICAL TRIALS ON GOING USING LIGHT TO TRY AN ANCHOR PEOPLE'S ATTENTION AND MOOD AND WELL BEING F OR SAKE OF FOCUSS AND I THINK THAT WHILE I LOVE THIS SAYING THAT A YOU MENTION YOU TAKE A FOTON NOT A PILL AND WITH DO RESPECT TO THE NEED FOR FARMICOLOGY FOR SOME CERTAIN PEOPLE THINK MOST PEOPLE JUST HAVING REALLY DILED IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO LIGHT IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS THEM TO RULE OUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY NEED ABTEDICATION ABSOLUTELY THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT I CAN'T AFTER THAT LET'S TALK ABOUT GET LAG BUT NOT IN THE CONTACT OF OCAY IF SOMEBODY'S TRAVELLING FROM EUROPE TO JAPAN OR FROM THE SECON BECAUSE THAT VERYS TREMENDOUSLY RIGHT ON ME TERE'S AS MANY DIFFERENT VERIATOVS ON TRAVEL AS THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE AND WITH GRILSAN JOBS ET CETERA BUT RATHER LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT OR THE TWO OR THREE THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO TO A JUST THEYR SCADUR QUICKLY YESTERDAY I CALLED YOU AND SAID LUCK I KNOW SOMEBODY WHOSE TRAVELLING SIX HOURS I WON'T EVEN MENTION IN WHICH DIRECTION CAUSE I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO ANCHOR TO THAT EXAMPLE AND YOU DESCRIBE SOME VERY SIMPLE TOOLS A VIEWING LIGHT A LITTLE BIT EARLIER THAN NORMAL AND GETTING ON THE LOCAL FOODS CADUAL ET CETERA THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO SHIFT MORE QUICKLY AND THE REASON I WANT TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION IS YES FOR THE TRAVELLERS AND FOR THE A THE SHIFT WORKERS BUT MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT YOU'VE PROVEN AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT PEOPLE ARE DESRUPTED IN THEIR CIRCANIAN BEHAVIOR AT HOME SO WHAT ARE THE ASIDE FROM WHAT WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT HOW CAN ONE A JUST QUICKLY TO A NEW SCADUAL LIKE LET'S A FALL CLASSES ARE STARTING YOU STARTN NEW JOB R YOU HAVE A BABYER OR POPULER WHATEVER WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO SHIFT THE CLOCK QUICKLY SO IT'S VERY SIMPLE AS WE'VE TOK YESTERDAY SO IMAGINE YOU'RE I IN THE OUTSIDE WITH NO ENVIRONMENT TO WITH NO INDUSTRIAL LIGHT IF YOU IF YOURBODY THINKS YOU'RE IN EARLY EVENING AND YOU SEE A BRIGHT LIGHT WHAT DOES THIS TELL YOU OH WAIT THIS IS NOT EARLY EVENING YET IT'S STILL EARLY AFTERNOON OR LATE AFTERNOON SO I HAVE TO DELAY MYHT CLOCK TO GO BACK TO LATE AFTER SO IF YOU GET LIGHT EARLY IN THE EVENING IT DELAYS YOUR OCLOCK SO WHAT DOES YOU NEED THAT MAKES YOU WANT T GO A SLEEP LATER YES IT DELAYS YOURCLOCK SO SO YOU'RE IN NEW YORK  RIGHT PEOPLE IN ITALY HAVE AN ADVANCE CLOCK BECAUSE THEY THEYE ARE SIX HOURS AHEAD OF US SO IF YU'RE IN NEW YORK AND YOU GET LIGHT EARLY IN THE EVENING YOU DELAY EVEN FURTHER FROM ITALY SO NOW YOUR DELAYING AWAY FROM ITALY NOW THE SAME THING HAPPENS LET'S SAY YOU THOUG DOWNT CAME OP AND YOU THOUGHT IT'S ALREADY DAWN BUT IT WAS LESS SAY THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING OR FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND THEN YOU GET THA BRIGHT LIGHT AND YOU SAY ALWAIT A MINUTE DON'T IT'S NOT UP YET SO I SHOULD ADVANCE MY CLOCK OR AT NIGHT BUT I'M GETTING BRIGHT LIGHT SO I SHOULD RUN BECAUSE DON IS ALREADY UP SO THEN LATER IN THE NIGHT LATER IN YOUR NIGHT AND ACTUALLY JUST APPENS THAT HUMANS YOU GET A TEMPERATURE N A DEAR LATER AND THEN I TEMPERLO TEMPERATURE IN YOUR BODY AFTER THAT LIGHTS TAT ADVANCING YOUR O'CLOCK SO IF YOU WANT TO GO TO ITALY INSTEAD OF GETTING LIGHT EARLY IN THE EVENING YOU WANT TO GET LIGHT AFTER THA TEMPERATURE LO SO YOU COULD ADVANCE YOU O'CLOCK EVEN BEFORE YOU GO TO ITALY AND YOU CATCHING UP TO THE ITALIANS JUST BY USING ONE IS AS SIMPLE AS THAT YR SO YOU COULD DO IT FOR EVERY RESION YOU COULD CARCLY HOW MUCH THERE ARE ADVANCE OF YOU YOU COULD KNOW HOW MUCH THESE LIKHE SIFTS HAPPENE PERDAY AND YOU CAN CALCULATE WHAT YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO DO VERY SIMPLE MA TO ADJUST EITHER IN DIRECTION OF DELAYN IF YOURE GOING FROM NEW YOR CALIFORNI WHEN A DELAY YOUR 'CLOCK OR ADVANCING IF YOU'RE GOING FROM NEW YORK TO ITALY SO IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT OF VISUAL AND BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO THIS NOT LOOKING AT OUR INVIDIO WE WILL PUT A A A DOUBT OF A ZERO COSS DOWN LOADABLE A FIGURE OF THIS ON THE HU BERMEN LAB DOR COM WEB SIGHT RELATE TO THIS APISODE BUT I THINK I CAN SUMMARIZE IT IN ON IN LANGUAGE AS WELL IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY WHAT YOUR SAYING IS IF YOUR TYPICAL WAKE UP TIME IS SA SEVEN A M THEN YOUR LOW POINN TEMPERATURE PROBABLY OCCUR SOMEWHERE ROUND FIVE A M AND IF YOU VIEW LIGHT RIHTER BACT AROUND THEN IT'S GOING TO ESSENTIALLY ADVANCE YOUR CLOC BECAUSE THEN YOUR YOUR BODY THINKS AL ITS SEVEN O'CLOCKS TO ADVANCE YOUR O'CLOCK BY ONE TO TWO HOURS BUT IF I WERE TOF YOU LIGHT SAY AT THREE A M THEN IT WOULD PROBABLY DELAY MY CLOCK YA  YE SO AND THEN US SAY I LAND IN A NEW SCADUL I WANTED JUST TO NEWSCADULA SAD IDN MANAGE TO DO ANYTHING WITH MY LIGHT VIEWING BEFORE I WENT OUT IDN'T I DIDN'T ANTICIPATE THE TRIP SUDDENLY UM ON A NEW SCATEL  I WAS TOLD THAT ONE OF THE WAYS TO HELP SHIFT THE CLOCK AND TO AVOID GASTERAN TASTONA ISSUES IS TO EAT ON THE LOCAL SCATEL TO START BASICALLY BEHAVING LIKE A LOCAL EVEN THOUGH YOUR STRICATING CLOCK WILL TAKE A LITB OF TIME TO CATCH UP ABSOLUTELY BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THE LIH RIGHT SO LET'S LET'S NOW THAT WE EXPLAIN THITS VERY SIMPLY LES TAKE A VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE RIGHT NEW YORK TO ITALY THAT'S SIMPLE EXAMPLE NEW YORK TIME ITALY TIME SIX HOUR DIFFERENCE RIGHT SO LET'S SAY YOU FLY FROM NEW YORK AT NIGHT YOU REACH ITALY AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHAT IS THE TIME IN YOUR NEW YORK TIME YOU ALTHOUGH YOU READ SIX HOURS BA SIX OU TO ANO IT'S TO A M SO WHEN YOU LAND ITALY YOU WANT TO AVOID LIGHT LIKE THE PLAY YAR YOU COULD EAT BUT YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO GET ALAVIC AS OTHERWISE IT'S CAN ADE LA AN DELAOS CAN E SEND YOU TO CALIFORNIA INSTEAD OF SENDING YOU TO ITALY RIGHT AND SO THIS IS SUCH A KEY POINT IF ANY ONE'S CONFUSED ABOUT THIS WE WILL PUT SOME DIAGRAMS UP BUT WHAT SAMER SAYING IS SO CRUCIAL JUST BECAUSE GETTING BRIGHT LIGHT IN YOUR EYES EARLY IN THE DAY IS REALLY BENEFICIAL WHEN YOUR HOME WHEN YOU TRAVEL TO A NEW TIMES ON YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT YOUR BODY THINKS WHAT EXCUSE ME YOU HA T TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHERE YOUR BODY THINKS YOU ARE AND SO F YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE ITALIAN SUNRISE HAVING JUST FLOWN FROM NEW YORK TO ITALY AND YOU DIDN'T PREPARE FOR THAT TRIP BY WAKING UP A LITTLE BIT EARLIER IN ANTICIPATION MULPOPLTE ND YOVIEW LIGHT IT TO A EXCUSE ME AT'S AT SIX OR SEVEN A M ITALIAN TIME BEAUTIFUL ITALIAN SUNRISE YOU ARE GOING TO DELAY YOUR CLOCK YOU'RE GOING TO BASICALLY THROW YOURSELF BACK TO CALIFORNIA BUT YOU ARE IN ITALY YOU'ARE NT THROW YOUR BIOLOGY BACK TO CALIFORNIA AND YOU ARE GOING TO BE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ITALIAN NIGHT AND YOU'RE GN TO BE MIS A MISERABLE I'LL TELL A BRIEF A AN IT JOOKC AUSE I CALLED SAMMER IN DESPERATION A FEW YEARS AGO I TRAVELLE TO ABUDABBY AND WHY YOU ABUDABBY TO GIVE A SEMINAR TWELVE HOURS OUT OF PHASE AT'S A TWELVE HOUR FLIP AND I THOUGHT I COULD JUST MUSTLE IT I THOUGHT I'LL GET UP JUST VIEW SUNLIGHT WHEN THE SUN COMES UP AND I FELL APART MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY AND SAMMER CAME TO MY RESCUE I CALL THEM I SAID I DON'T KNO WHAT TO DO AND HE SAID GO TO THE JIM WET AT THE LOCAL DAWN WORK OUT EAT AND THEN VIEW SUNLIGHT STARTING THE NEXT DAY AND THAT BASILY GOT ME ON TO SCATCEL SO I USED FOOD AND EXERCISE TO ADJUST MYSELF BECAUSE MY LIFE YOUING ACTIVITY WAS JUST COMPLETELY OT AWACK I MEAN AN AN WE TAKED ABOUT OTHER DETAIL SO YOURE HAVE TO CACUDATE IT BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT I MEAN IT'S IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO AVOID GETTING THER OWN LIGHE INFORMATION WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO AJUST YOUR BODY BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT CHIFTS YO THE OTHER TO THE OTHER SIDE ABSOLUTE GOING WILL YOU ARE ONE OF THESE PEOPLE THAT HAS SUCH VIGOR IT'S ONETHESE THINGS WERE HAVING KNOWN YOU ALL THESE YEARS YOU HAVE A TREMENDOUS CAPACITY FOR WORK AND FOR SOCKER AND FOR ARGUING RESPECT FUL ARGUING AND YOU KNOW SOMETIMES YOU KNOWS GETTING WORSE WITH H YE WELL WE CUL TALK ABOUT THAT OFFLING BUT I THINK A LOT OF YOUR VIGOR AND A LOT OF YOUR ABILITY TO WORK HARD AND FOCUS AND REALLY DO SO MANY THINGS AT AN IMPRESSIVE LEVEL IS BECAUSE YOU THINK ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND YOU YOU THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO BE OPTIMOL FOR FOCUS WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE OPTIMAL FOR EXERCISE WHEN AND THE WHEN IS THE KEY IT'S AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVE IN THE LANDSCAPE OF FEELING LIKE THERE SOMETHING BROKEN INSIDE THEM ITCAUSE THEY  CAN'T FOCES HN TIT UP TO LUNCHES REMEMBER IT'S ALL SUBCONSCIOUS THESE EFFECTS AND UNDER YOU'RE ABSOLUTE RECT NO HONESTLY JOKING ASIDE ABOUT AGE I REALLY AGREE WITH YOU THAT I THINK PART OF THE RES AND IM CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS THAT I REALLY THINK ABOUT IT AND I MAKE SURE THAT I KEEP EVERYTHING ALINE AND AND TOT ACTUALLY HOUSE ME ALONG LIKE I DON SUFFER IN SLEEP I DON'T SUFFER IN WAKING UP I NEVER USE A TIME OR TO WAKE OUT I MEAN PEOPLE SAY AREN'T YOU SCARED LIKE YOU HAVE TO GIVE A NEXTURE AT EIGHT OR SEVEN PIT ANSCALS LIKE THIT IS NOWAY I'M GOING TO GO BEYOND THAT IT JUST EVEN IF I TRY I CAN'T SLEEP BEYOND SIX AM IN MY REGULAR TIMES IT JUST ITS NUTGAN HAPPAN BY FOURTHIRTY MY EYES ARE WIDE A  AWAKE AON BED IT'S JUST SYSTEM IS SO ALINE IT WORKS A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE WILL SAY HOW COME MY GO TO SLEEP I FALL SLEEP FINE BUT THAT I WAKE UP AT THREE OR FOUR IN THE MORNING IN CAN'T FALL BACK ASLEEP IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THOSE PEOPLE WERE SUPPOSED TO GO TO BED AT EIGHT P M IT'S POSSIBLE I MEAN IT IS POSSIBLE IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE WUL WAKE UP AND GO BACK TO SLEEP BUT BUT YA I MEAN IT IS POSSIBLE A OR IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEIR CLOCK IS COMPLETELY MISALINE THAT THEY ARE GETTING MAY BE IN THAT TIME THAT NIGHT WHEN THEY ARE SUPPOSE AND THEN THEY POSSIBLY FEEL SO SLEEPY IN THE DAY SO THERE ALL THESE ARE POSSIBLE COMBINATION THAT'S INTERESTING ADAN CONSIDERED SO I MEAN THAT WHAT THEY THINK IS THER SLEEP THEIR BODY IS SO OUT OF WHACK WITH THE LIGHT OUR CYCLE THAT IT ACTUALLY A NENNA OR OR THE WEAKER PART OF THE SLEEP I MEAN YOU SEE THIS IN IN WHEN YOU TRAVEL TO DIFFERENT TIMES ON BEFORE YOU ARE JUST YOU GO TO SLEEP REALLY WELL BHUT TWO HOURS LATER YOU FULLY OUP TWO HOURS IF YOU WERE SO TIRED AND THIS IS YOUR REGULAR SLEEP THERE'S NO WAY YOU GET A WAKE UP IN TWO HOURS SO THEN YU FEEL VERY SLEEPINATER IN THE DAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO IT DEPENDS OF HOW YOUR WHOLE SYSTEM IS ALINE TO THE N MAR THAT'S VERY INTERESTING IDEA I I IL THINK THAT'S GON A RESINATE WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE I WAKE UP EVERY MORNING AROUND AM THREE OR FOUR I GENERALLY USE ABAUT HMEN THAN I FALL BACK A SLEEP VERY VERY DEEPLY DOESN'T SEEM TO DISTRUPT MY DAYTIME WIKEFULNESS AM AND I THINK AL OUR PEOPLE OF SASS OVER THAT THAT WAKING UP AND WORRY THEIR SUMSING WRONG PROVIDED THEY CAN GO BACK ASL EXILY ITSIL IF YOU CANT GO USE THE BAUTO GO BACK SLEEP THAT SHOULD NOT BE A PROMMAYBE SOME PEOPLE WHEN THEY GO TO USE THE BOUTOF THE USE VERY BRIGHT LIGHT AND THEN THEY GET AN ALERTING SIGNAL SO IF IF YOU MAYBE THAT I COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS THAT THAT AFFIX YOU MAYBE WHEN YOU WAKE UP YOU PUT TIMES O FLY OR OUSTART READING YOUR EYEPE SO THERE'S ALL THESE COMBINATION THAT WE STILL DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT COULD BE AFFECTING THEIR SLEEP WAKE THREG THEMS AN THEIR SLEEP MAINTENANCE DO USE MELLATONE AND AT YOU TAKE MELLATONEEN I DON'T NEED IT TO BE ONS IN MY CASE THERE IS NO REASON TO USE IT BECAUSE I COULD GUARANTEE YOU THAT BY MAYBE EIGHT O'CLOCK MY MERTONA HAS ALREADY STARTED TO GO UP AND BY THE TIME I SLEEP MY MERTONE IS VERY HIGH BECAUSE I DON'T USE E MORE FMIGHTS AFTER SUNSET AND LIGHT IN HIBITS MELLATONE AND LIFES REALLY BLUNKSMA ATON AN LEVEL BUT YOU HEAR THESMIST THAT THE PINEO GLAND A CALTSOFIES AS WE GET OLDER IS THAT  YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT I EN IVE HEARD ABOUT THAT BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW WHAT DOES I MEAN THERE'S NOT VERY CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT AFFIXS THE SLEEP I DON'T KNOW MUCH AMAUT IT TO BE ON SIR THE EVIDENCE THAT I'VE SEEN IS THAT YESTER SOME CALSIFICATION AROUND THE PINEO JUST BECAUSE O WERE IT SITS IN THE IN THE BRAIN AM IT'S CLOSE TO SOME ABONY BON O STRUCTURES BUT I DON'T THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE THAT IT HAS NEGATIVE EFFACTS THE MEAN IF YIF YOU STILL HAVE YOU COULD MEASURE MEN ATONEN AN THAT SHOULD TELL YOU IF IT HAS THE I SUCH AN EASY THING TO DO I THINK THIS IS MORE OF A OF A INTERNET WELLNESS THING THAT HONES BUT THAT GOT OUTSIDE THE AMACAGE HER ABSOLUTELY RIGHT YEN I SOUNDS TERRIBLE CALCIFICATION YEAAS THAT THE THING RIGHT A THE HARD THING RI YE EXACTLY A LET'S TALK ABOUT SEASONALITY A LITTLE BED I LEARNED AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS STILL TRUE A BUT THAT MOST SUICIDES OCCUR IN APRIL IN THE SPRING I THINK THERE'S A POEMNES AYS APRILIS THE CRUELEST MONTH I THINK IT BEIS THE POEM BEGINS A AR THER DALA THAT SUICIDES ARE MORE FREQUENT IT'S PARTICULAR TIMES OF YEAR AND IF SO IS THE SPRING THAT TIME OF YEAR YI MEAN LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THIS AND AND ONE OF THE HYPOTHESIS THAT IS THAT THE WINTER MONTHS THAT ARE VERY BAD FOR MOOD TAY PEOPLE NOT WANTING TO DO ANYTHING AND THEY HAVE THEY GET INTO SUCH DEEP LEVEL OF DEPRESSION THAT WHEN THE SUN COMES UP THEY GET ACTUALLY THE ENERGY TO ACT ON THEIR DEPRESSION WICH SONS REALLY TERRIBLE AND IT IS TERRIBLE TEROTAS SO THAT'S THE IDEA THAT THE LACK OF LIGHT TOART THE WINTER CAS THEM TO GO INTO SUCH DEPRESSION THAT THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE DOING ANYTHING AND WHEN THE LIGHT COMES IN WITH RIGOUR IN THE SPRING IT GIVES THEM THAT AFTER ALL THE DEPRESSION THEY SUFFERED GIVES THEM THAT PUSH TOO TO TAKE THAT SAN FINAL IO AND I GUESS WHAT OTHER SEASONABLE EFFECTS HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN HUMAN T I MEAN I THINK IN HUMANS IS NOT VERY CLEAR BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK ABOUT SEASONARITY BUT IF YOU START THINKING ABOUT US I THINK WE GOES THROUGH MASUR SEASON OR CHANGES I REALLY DO I THINK OUR EATING PATEN CHANGE ACROSS THE I COULD TELL YOU THAT ME THINKING ABOUT THIS THERE IS A CLEAR CHANGES THAT HAPPENS TO ME ACROSS THE YEAR BUT FOR ANIMALS THIS IS REALLY ESSENTIAL BECAUSE FOR ANIMALS THEY HAVE TO TIME THEIR MATING BEHAVIOR WIS WHEN THEY DELIVER THEIR THE PROGENY IN THE MOST ABUNDANT AMOUNT OF FOOD AND ARTIFICIAL LIGHT IS CAUSING MASUR DESRUPTION BECAUSE IF YOU CHANGE THE WAY THESE ANIMALS ARE RECEIVING THELIGHT INFORMATION THEY EITHER START MAKING MUCH EARLIER OR MUCH LATER AND THEIR NUMBERS DWINDLE AND THEY GET INTO THE TANGERS OF REALLY COMPLETELY GETTING ENEMENATED OR EXTAMED O HUMAN BIRTHRIGHTS ARE DEAFLING GOING DOWN I ME NOT IN HE YOUAP IN THE OUAS INSOGIARY THE AT OTHERS NOT OTHER RIGHT AN BUT OR THE RATHER EFFECTS OF SEASONALITY ON HUMANS THAT WE ARE AWARE OF I HONESTLY LIKE YOU COULD SEE IT HONESTLY COULD SEE IT PERFECTLY I THING IN IN SCANDE NAVY I MEAN YOU COULD TALK TO PEOPLE AND WHO LIVE IN SURE THEY GET SEASONABLE DEPRESSION WHAT SEASON DEPRESSION IS ONE BUT ACTUALY WHEN YOU START ASKING THEM QUESTIONS THEY TELL YOU LIKE IN THE WINTER THEY BARELY COULD WAKE UP THEY BARELY HAVE THE ENERGY FOR EVEN DEPRESSION EVEN PEOPLE WHO DON'T GET SEASON AL DEPRESSIN THEY'LL TELL YOU OUR ENERGY LEVELESS LOWER OUR I BELIET IT GO TO WORK IS IS NOT THE SAME AND IN THE SUMMER MOST PEOPLE ACTUALLY SLEEP VERY LITTLE THEY TELL YOU WE WE REALLY CAN WE FEEL LIKE WEMANIC WE HAVE ALL THIS ENERGY AND NOTHING IN NEGATIVE WAY IN IF ONY WER RIGHT I MEAN BUT IF YOU WANT A SLEEP WE HAVE TO PUT THESE CURTAN I THINK IN THESE SITUATIONS YOU COULD REALLY APPRECIATE THE SEASONATYY OF HUMANS I THINK WE KIND OF DESTROYED OUR SEASONALITY BECAUSE WE DON'T GET EXPOSED TO THAT MUCH NATURAL LIGHT WE HAVE ALL THIS ARTIFICIAL LIGHT BUT I THINK HONESTLY ONE OF THE THINK THAT IS GAN A HAPPENED IF THEY FOLLOW YOU RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT GIVING LIGHT AT THE SAME TIME GIVING FOOD GIVING EVO LUSS BE CLEAR THOSE OF YOUR RETOMENT WIL A ME AR JUST A AN JUST VEIR ATTRIBUTION WHAT SAY IS THAT THIS IS GAN A CAUSE THEM TO ALSO EXPERIENCE SOME CHANGES ACROSS THE SEAS AN BECAUSE NOW THEY GET US SEE THE SUN DIFFERENTLY IF YOU GET A GO OUT IN THE MORNING IN THE SUMMER YOU GET A GET TIN MUCH BROUGHT THAT'S WHY DON'T LIKE THE CHANGE IN TIME I KNOW PEOPLE THINK ALL BECAUSE YOUR BUY US TO BECAUSE I THINK WE SORRY THE CHANGE OU RETUN BY DAYLIGHT SAVE IND DAYLIGHT SAVING IT'S SUCH A BAD IDEA BECAUSE IT DESRUPS THAT THRYTHM THAT YOURE HAVING CAUSE I THINK YOUR BUDY IF YOU KEEP THAT RITHEN YOU WILL SEE THE WHOLE SEASONALITY AND I LOOK AT IT FROM A DIFFERENT ASPECT THAN OTHER PEOPLE IT REALLY AND PEOPLE SAY ON BY US BECAUSE IM MORNING PERSON AND I MAY BE TRUE BUT THIRS SITUATIORY CONSPIRACY BUT MORNING PEOPLE BUT THIS IS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND THET IS A SITUATION WERE YOU'RE GETTING LIGHT PERFECTLY WELL AND THEN ALLOFSON THEY DELAYE BY ONE HOUR BECAUSE AND THEN EVEN THOUGH IT'S THE SUMMER YOUR BUDDY NOW IF YOUR STILL NOT A JUSTING THINK ALWAY WHAT HAPPENED WHAT KIND OF HAPPENED O I'M GLAD YOU BRINGING THESELF BECAUSE I ALWAYS THOUGHT IN WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ONE HOUR RIHT ONE HOUR SHEPT YO SPRINGS OL HAROT AT JUST ONE OUR  BUT THE BUT THIS GOES BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF OUR DISCUSSION IT'S NOT JUST ONE RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S ONE HOUR ACROSS THAT ONE DAY BUT LORE ISNE SCUMULATIVE EFFECT ON THE CLOCK AND THES THA THREE ELEMENTS OF YOUR LA  TRY PARTITE MODEL IT UT OUR HOMOSTATIC SLEEP AND THE LIKE EXRACT EFFECTS A AND WHEN IT'S SO CLOSE IT'S SOMETIMES HARD TO IF FIGURE OUT HOW TO ADJUSTET PERFECTLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW WERE ALREADY SLEEP DEPRIVED IN OUR SOCIETY AND THEN YOU SHIFTET BY YOU KNOW SO I IT JUST ITK ALL ACCUMULATES AND IT HAS NO BENEFIT WI YOU WORK AT A MAJOR GOVERNMENT ORANIZATION NATIONAL INSTITUTE MENTAL HEALTH WI ON WE YOU CAMPAIGN FOR I HAVE NO IDEA A MAY IT MAKES NOAN SAING WHYO WE GO CAMPAGN OU LAST TO AND IT IT MAKES SO SENSE TO HAVE THE SUMMER LIGHT GOES UP AT NINE P M THE LIGHT GOES DOWN WHERE I LIVE IN BALTIMORE AT NINE P M AND THEN ALL OF SUDDEN WHEN YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE THE LIGHE LONGER IN THE DAY YOU KNOW SHIFT THE OTHER WAY AND NOW IT GOES ORESON AT SIX PEEM WHY DO YOU DO THESE DRASTIC CHANGES WIL LET IT BLEND ACROSS THE WHOLE SEASON YOU KNOW YES LATER EARLIER AT NIGHT BUT IT'S AT LEAST CONSISTENT IT GOES IN A VERY CONSISTENT MATTER I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DO THIS IT MAKES NO SONS WELL I THINK THAT THE REASON THEY DO IT IS BECAUSE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE BY ALIC SHOT ANCAUSE ONE HOUR SEEMS TRIVIAL UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE REPRECUTIONS OF THAT ONE HOUR SHIFT BECAUSE WHAT'S ALSO CLEAR NOW BYS TON WHAT YOU'R SAYING IS THAT THAT ONE HOUR SHIFT IS TAKING YOU OUT OF ALINEMENT WITH THE NATURAL LIGHT DARK CYCLE IN EXACTLY THE WRONG DIRECTION IT'S PUSHING PEOPLE TO GET EVEN LATER IN THE SUMMER WHEN LIGHT IS GOING TO PUSHU LATER ANYWAY IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE YOU PUT IT BEAUTIFULLY I JUST RAMBLE AND THIS IS ON OR YOU MADE IT YOU MADE IT CLEAR HAVING IT'S LIKE LITERALLY IT MADE YOU IT MAKE PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING PROBLEM HAVING AN ADVANCE SLEEP WIR THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE DELAYED NOW YOU GIVE THEM THIS HOUR TO MAKE THEM EVEN MORE DELAYED YOU PUSH THEM EVEN LATER IN THE DAYLIGHT SICE IT JUST DOESN'T MAKES OS AT ALL I THINK TWENTY TWENTY TWO SHOULD BE THE YEAR THAT WE A BALLHON MAN TEIN SAYING TO DAY FOR ME HONESTLY WELL I SAND WELL ALSO IF IT HAS A POSIVE EFFECT ON THE WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY AN EPIDAMIC OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND OTHER ISSUES RELATED TO IMPROPER INTERACTIONS WITH LIGHT THAT I THINK US IS A WELL WORS WHILE CAUSE AND ALOU CAN WE CAXOR SO FOR ONCE WEE IN A FIGT WITH SOME WITH ANOTHER OMIN LO  LARMIN BATTLES POE WITH ONEIN THE CIRCADIUN PEOPLE HOWUST TI TO GIVE THEM CREDIT HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR YEARS TO ARBOLISH DAY LIGHT SAVING YET THE PROMIERS THEY ALL GO TO SLEEP AN NINE P M AND WAKE UP IT FOUR M SO WE NEVER SEE THEM ANOTHER CICINION A COMMUNITY HAS DONE IN AMAZING JOB OF FIGURING OUT WHAT WE NEED AND THEN THE CHALLENGE OF COURSE IS MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE GET WHAT THEY NEED AND MAKING SURE THAT AT A SOCIETAL LEVEL WE'RE NOT AND VOLVING OURSELF INTO THE RAND THE RETEST PROBLEM IS THAT THE LATE WAKING PEOPLE THEY THINK THAT REALLY AND I'M GON TRY TO PUT IN A BETTER WAY NOW THEY THINK OL BECAUSE YOURE MORNING FOR US AND YOU WANT TO SEE THE SUN EARDLY SO YOU WANT ME TO SUFFER IT DROPPINGLA BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN THEY SHIFTED BACK AFTER THE DAYLIGHT SAVING NOW THEY GEN A MAKE YOU SUFFER REALLY BADLY BECAUSE NOW IS GOING TO BE EARLIER RIGHT IN THE FALL IN THE FALL WHERE THERE IS NOTHIN O LIGHT I THEY EEVEN THE SAME WAY SO TRY TO CONVINCE THEM THAT ACTUALLY THIS AT THE END CAUSE IT MORE TROUBLE WHEN YOU NEED THE LINE FOR YOUR LATE SCEDUAL IN THE FULL WHEN THEY SHIFTED BACK THEN THEY SAY KEEP IN DAYLIGHT SAVING ALL THE TIME AND THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN THAT IS VERY BACK LIKE PEOPLE HAVE DONE STUDIES THAT LITERALLY TOO ARIES CLOSE TO EACH OTHERS AND AR IS THAT WORD THE WHOLE YEAR ON DAYLIGHT SAVING HAS MUCH MORE PROBLEMS EVE N IN CANCERADES IN DEPRESSION SO YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT SO THAT'S WHAT TRYING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT YOU NEED TO PREVENT THAT'S WHICH AND YOU DON'T NEED THEY LIGHE SAVING AT ALL THAT'S WHERE THE PROBLEM HAPPENS INTERESTING I HAD NOT THOUGHT ABOUT THAT BUT YES YOU LAY RISERS THAT IN THE FALL WHEN THEY WHEN THAT'S TOU FALL BACK AS THEY SEY SPRING FORWARD FALL BACK YOU TALL BCK THE CLOCK IT'S REALLY COMPOUNDING THE PROBLEM THAT ALL TE HANGEXES AND IT'S REALLY NICE IF YOU THINK KEEP IT CONSISTENT IN THE SPRING YOU GET THE LO YOU KNOW WHEN U GET THE EQUINOX AND THEN THE DAYS START GOING UP AND THEN EVEN IN THE SUMMERS ARE GOING THA AND THEN THE FALL YOU GET THE OTHER EQUINOX AND GO BACK SO IT'S VERY SYMMETRICAL RIGHT IT GOES INTO SHORT DAY LONGER LONON TAN SHORT DAY AGAIN BUT NOW YOU GETTING THESE BARMPS IN BOTH SIDES OF THE SPRING AND FOR WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT SOMETHING THAT IS BEAUTIFULLY CYMMETRICAL BEAUTIFULLY SMOTH YOU PUTTING BUMPS INTO IT WHILE EN WE IND NOT JUST BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE IT'S THERE BUT I BUT EVOLVED A MESANCLY THIS IS THIS AN  YY OF ALL THA FIR SEASIN ANRYIS OUR MONSYER EVEN APART FROM THE EXACT EQUATOR EVERY PART OF THE EARTH HAVE SEASONALITY AND ONE OF BRIEFLY TOUCH ON SOMETHING WHICH IS INDIVIDUAL ANCHENETIC VARIATION IN SENSITIVITY TO LIGHT AS AN NOT CHRONOTYTE BUT A FIRST O ALR VERY BASIC QUESTION AN DO PEOPLE WITH LIGHT EYES LIGHT COLOURED EYES ARE THEY MORE SENSITIVE TO LIGHT THAN PEOPLE WITH DARKER PIGMENTED EYES I MEAN HONESTLY IT MAKES SENSE THEYLL BE MORE BECAUSE IF YOU THINK OF OF MY DARK PUPIL IT'S BLOCKING MOON LIGHT SO IF YOU HAVE LIGHT PUPIL YES FOR VISION IT MAY NOT BE VERY OBVIOUS BUT FOR SOMETHING THAT IS MEASURING THE OT TO FLIGHT YOU GETTING MORE LIGHT THAN ME SO YOU PROBABLY NEED LESS LIGHT TO BE EFFECTIVE AS AS SOMEBODY WHOSE DARKER AND AND THAT MAYBE COULD EXPLAIN WHY SOMETIMES LIGH TO PEOPILE SAY I DON'T WANT O GOING TO VERY BRIGHT CONDITIONS BECAUSE IT'S REALLY BRIGHT YELL I CAN'T I CAN'T EVEN BE AT A CAFE WITHOUT ONE OF THESE REFLECTIVE TABLES AKE A MITAL TABLE UNLESS I HAVE VERY DARK SONE GLASSES OF THEARE SO BRIGHT IT'S PAINFUL THRING WHERAS SOME PEOPLE LIKE YOU WE SAT OUTSIDE THEIR MEALS AN AR LIKE FINE I SOON NOSE CAVE YOUR DAINIANG TOUGHNESS NO OES IY OF IT'S REALLY T A PUPIL BLOCKS MORE LIGHT SO I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IS AS SIMPLE AS THE PUPIL BLOCKING MOR LIGHT CAN HAVE SENSITIVITY BUT YOU QUESTION IS ALSO GOES DEEPER ARE THERE MORE SENSITIVITY DIFFERENCES AN AND MY UNDERSTANDING WOULD BE OU WOULDS THINK THAT IT MAY BE DEPENDS ON HOW EFFECTIVE YOURSELVES ARE IN RESPONDING TO LIGHT HOW HOW HEALTHY YOUR I PIARGI SEES ARE SO I WOULD BUT THERE'S NOT MANY STUDIES TO SHOW THAT WHAT IS REALLY CLEAR THAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT PATIENCE WITH MY POOLER THEY SEEM TO HAVE DIFFERENT SENSITIVITIES TO LIGHT SO IT SEEMS THAT AT LEAST PEOPLE WHO HAVE A PSYCHOLOGICAL O A CHANGES THEY MAY HAVE DIFFERENCE TO THE SENSITIVITY OF LIGHT SO WHERE ARE THOSE DIFFERENCES IN A PARTICULAR DIRECTION I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT LAFTER WE CAN LOOK IN OUT YE E  I YU KNOW AND PEOPLE HAVE HEARD ME SAY THE AD NAUSEUM TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ACTUALLY ROLL THEIR EYES BUT YOU KNOW THAT THESE ARE THE ONLY TWO PIECES OF BRAIN ON POINTING TO MY EYES FOLKS THAT AR OUTSIDE THE CRANING OF VAULT THEY ARE TO PIECES OF BRAIN THAT IT BASICALLY INFORM THE BRAIN ABOUT WHETHER NOT TO BE ALERT OR SLIMP BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THOSE TWO LOW PIECES OF BRAIN THAT WE CALL EYES WOULD HAVE GENETIC VARIATIONS E ROT I COLOR IS GENETICALLY MOCUL IS THAT DETERMINED AM THAT THERE WOULD BE GENETC VARIATIONS BASED ON WHEATHER OR NOT YOURE ANCESTRY OF ALL NEAR THE EQUATER OR FURTHER FROM THE ENQUATOR I MA YOU SEE MORE BLUE EYES AND SCANNIAVY A YO E  I MAN WI THE LACK OF LIGHT THE SAID YOU NEED MORE LESS IN HIBITION BECAUSE THEREIS NOT IN A FLI TRYT SO THAT'S THE IDEA OF THE CHANGING COLOUR A SO H I DON'T LIKERE WITH YOU I MAY I THINK THIS IS AN HAIRIER THAT WILL BE STUDIED LATER AND WILL BE IMPERICALLY DETERMINE THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IN THIS FIELD RIGHT NOW WHICH I THINK IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS WE DON'T HAVE A WAY TO MEASURE THE I PIAGO SEE SENSITIVITIES INHUMAN SO WE STILL LIKE IT'S EASY TO MEASURE YOU ROT CON FUNCTION IF YOU GO TO ON OBTEMETRES THEY MEASURE ALL THE DETAILS I CONTRUSTED A LOOK AT THE CHAR YOU LASCOUT THE TE SNAN CHARLY LOOK AT THE LETTERS OF THE GAN VE YE BUT FOR THE NONE SUBCONSCIOU WE STILL DON'T HAVE A GOOD MEASURING SYSTEMS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS ANDRO SENSITIVIETY WHAT IS SAMMER SENSITIVEVTY WHAT IS THIS PERSON CENSITY AND I THINK WERE STARTING TO WORK ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO HOLEFULLY DEVELOPE THESE SICNINGS BUT TILLWE DEVELOPE THEM IT'S GANNOT BE VERY HARD TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE IS A SENSITIVITY DIFFERENCE HOW DE DE RELAT AN ON MEN A WOMAN YOU KNOW DARKAN UN LITHE AND OLDER YOU NORMAL VERSE A PSYCHOLOGICALLY ON EFFECT AND STUFF LIKE THAT FASCINATING O AND EVERY TIME YOU TALK I LEARNED SO MUCH IT'S LIKE A O IN THE BEST WAY THE BEST SENSE OF  OF THE TERM ITS ET IE IT'S A WATERFALL OF KNOWLEDGE AS A FINAL QUESTION I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT SENSITIVITY OF A WHOLE OTHER KIND AND THAT'S THE SENSITIVITY TO SPICY FOOD NOW THE REASON I'M ASKING THIS QUESTION WHAT SEEMINGLY OUT OF THE BLUE IS THAT I MADE THE MISTAKE ONCE OF HAVING SAMMER COOK FOR ME  AND I SAID NOT TO SPICY AND HE SAID OCANE NOT TO SPICY YASHES THAT WOKIN NOT TOO SPICY AND IT ALMOST KILLED ME I

I KNOW FOM MY EXPERIENCE WHEN AN IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP IN PLOTES DETONATED BY ONE SPEC TACULARLY OUT OF CHARACTER DECISION OF COURSE YOU TRY TO MAKE IT MAKE SENSE BHUT IT'S EXHAUSTING TO TRY AND PUT

AN HE TOLD ME FOR SOMETHING MORE HE WANTS TIM TO SEE THE SHOW SO TIM CAN UNDERSTAND BUT ALL THIS WAS LIKE FOR GABE AND APOLOGISE FOR THE WAY HE HANDLED GABE'S FEELINGS AND THEN MAYBE HE COULD IMAGINE HAVING HIM BACK AS A FRIEN THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH GABE'S PLAN HE'D NEVER ACTUALLY INVITED TIM TO THE SHOW HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DOING THE SHOW THE FIRST OIN OF THE SHOW WAS IN THESE SPRING TO THOSE MINETEN S YHOU'VE BEEN DOING THE SHOW FOR FOUR YEARS E AND YOU'VE NEVER INVITED HIM THROUGH THAT WHOLE TIME NO EVEN THOUGH YOU MADE THE SHOW FOR HIM YE I KNOW IT'S ONS DID YOU THINK THAT HE KNEW ABOUT

SOME POINT AND HANDFUL OF TIMES GAXULLY THOUGHT HE HEARD TIM'S LAUGH IN THE AUDIENCE IT SEEMED CRAZY TO ME TO PUT SO MUCH TIME AND ENERGY AND MONEY HE DIDN'T HAVE INTO MAKING SOMETHING FOR ESSENTIALLY ONE PERSON AND THEN STOPPING SHORT OF ACTUALY INVITING THAT PERSON TO SEE IT I'LL BE HONEST IF THE THIN GABE COMPLAINS ABOUT MOST AS HOW MEN DON'T TALK TO EACH OTHER ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS I JUST WONE TO SAY DU LOOK IN THE MER SINCE HE WAS NEVER GOING TO TAKE THE FINAL STEP JUST INVITE HIM HIM SOW I ASKED IF I COULD DO IT FOR HIM AFTER BRIEFLY PANICKING HE TOLD ME TO MAKE THE CALL TO MY SURPRISE N GABES ANXIOUS DELIGHT TIM AGREE TO COME WE WERE ALL SET TIM HAD HIS PLAIN TIC KET TO NEW YORK GABE HAD GROBBED A SLAUGHT AT LOCAL FEEDER AND STARTED SELLING TICKETS FOR THE SHOW AND THEN FOUR DAYS

VILLAIN IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE AN THOUGT WHY SUBJECT MYSELF TO THAT I CALL AND TEXED HIM BUT GET NO RESPONSE AND THEN TIM FINALLY CALLS ME BACK THE NIGHT BEFORE HE SUPPOST TO GET ON THE PLAN TO TELL ME HIS MIND WAS MADE OUT AS IT HAPPENS TIM CALLS ME AS I'M ON MY WAY OUT I'M GOING TO A BIRTHDAY DINNER WEREA'LL SEE MY EX FRIEND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE SYOU FRIEND UP MEVE A TEXE A YEAR AGOW AND THEN REFUSED TO DISCUSS WHAT HAPPENSC IWAS NAUSIATED AT THE THOUGHT OF SEEING ER AND YET I SPEND THE BETTER PART OF AN HOUR PACING OUTSIDE THE RESTAURAM TRYING TO CONVINCED TIM TO SEE HIS EX FRIEM NOWING MIND WAS JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RESTAURANT DOOR LIKE I GET WHY HE SAYING NO BUT I TELL HIM MOST OF US IN THIS SITUATION WE JUST TRYD TO AVOID OUR AX FRIEND THE BEST WE CAN AND OCCASIONALLY SUFFER THROUGH AWKWARD RUN INS UNTIL ONE OF US MOVES AWAY OR DIES BUT HE AND GABE HAVE THIS RARE KIND OF SPECIAL CHANCE TO ACTUALLY GETS HIM UNDERSTANDING AND I TELL TIM I HOPE HE TAKES THE OPPORTUNITY TIM SCKEPTICAL BUT THE NEXT DAY HE TECKS ME A PICTURE FROM THE PLAN GABE HEADS TO THE THEATER EARLY TO GET READY WHILE I GO COLLECT HIM IMMEDIATELY I SEE HO I GAVE LIKED HIM SO MUCH HE'S WARM AND CHATTY DESPITE BEING VISIBLY ON EDGE TIM AND I WALK TO THE SHOW TALKING ABOUT NOTHING TRYING TO PRETEND WERE NOT STROLLING INTO A VERY STRANGE SITUATION WHEN WE FIND OUR SEATS I TRYED TO TALK TO TIM ABOUT HOW HE'S FEELING BUT HE'S DISTRACTED LOOKING AROUND TRYING TO SE IF HE RECOGNIZES ANYONE AVE FILLING HAPPY TO BE HERE AT O IR NOW A A HAPPY HES THOT I WOULD USE THE WORK HAPPY I WOULD SAY LIKE THIS IS ITS WERTO   SER O TIM SPOTS GABES MOM AND THEN THE SHOW STARTS HE  GAE BEGINS THE SHOW BREASILY AND RIGHT AWAY THERE'S SOME JOKES THAT REALLY HIP FOR TIM A HA HA HA A A I WONDER IF GABE CAN HEAR TIMSLAK ON THE STAGE GAVE TELLS LOTS OF STORIES FROM THEIR FRIENDSHIP PAINTING THEM IS HIS KIND OF BUDY COMETY DOO IF DEAD POETS SOCIETY WERE A BUDDY COMEDY THE WAY I WERE TAKIN ENGWISH CLASS WHY WE JUST ALWAYS PRAISE WHATEVER WE'RE READING YOU DON'T PUT ME THE VERY UNFORTUNE POSITION F GON IT CN ASS DOING A PROFESSOR ANOTHER BANGER FROM MILL YOUNO A    BUT TIM OULD WALK IN A POTRY CLASS WAS LIKE OPINIONS YE ON'T'D LIKE JIST HOMES GOOD DISONS BAD ES THE BEST THING OF IVER THE SHOW IS NOT NAVING IN AT TAKE TOWN MOSTLY ABOUT HOW MUCH GAVE ADMIRES TIM AND YET THERE ARE MOMENTS THAT ARE HARD TO WATCH WHILE SITTING NEXT TO TIM LIKE WHEN GABRI COUNTS THE NIGHT NET AND BREA AN TIM CIM CLEAN HES AS WELL KAT NI AR TOGETHER IN WE'RE NOT SOR I'D PINNED A MIKE ON TIM AND THE ABSENCE OF SOUND COMING FROM HIM DURING THIS PART OF THE SHOW AS CONSPICUOUS I'D SPEN HOURS TALKING TO GAVE FOR THI STORY BUT SITTING THERE IN THE DARK OF THE THEATRE WITH TIM NO MATTER WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE PAST N SEEM GENUINELY HARD TO BE HIM IN THIS MOMENT I DON'T THINK I'D APPRECIATED THE BRAVERY ALL THIS REQUIRED ON TIM'S PART GAVE FINISHES THE SHOW TRI UMPHIN HE LATER TOLD ME IT'S E BEST HE'D EVER PERFORMED AFTERWARDS TIMNEEDS A MINUTE TO CLEAR IS HEAD HE SLIPS OUT FOR A WALK WHILE I STAND WITH GAVE IN FRONT OF THE THEATERE GABES IN THE MIDDLE OF SHOWING ME THE CLOBE CIGARETTES HE DOESN'T SMOKE ANY MORE BUT BOUGHT FOR NOSTALJA'S SAKE TO SMOKE WITH TIM WHEN TIM AS PEERES ARMS OPEN IMPOLES GAVE INTO A HUB HE MA  E  H  H WE DRIVE TO THE STUDIO AND GET RIGHT IN TO IT TIM SAID IT WAS STRANGE TO SENT THE AUDIENCE HEARING SOME ONE TALK ABOUT HIM KNOWING HE COULDN'T RESPOND OF COURSE IT DIDN'T STOP HIM FROM WANTING TO RESPOND IKE GET THE MOMENT WHEN IT'S REVEALED THAT HE AND CAKE GOT OTHER THE CROWD GOES OH HA YIM GOA H HA HA H HA TAT'S WHY WIVE YOR BULIRG EITHER NO ONE BOOD TO NIGHT SIK TE O CATY I CANT NOAPLAYS ALWAYS DIFFERENT IN THIS IS THISIS A AI AGREE THERE IS A DIFFERENCE THE TWO REMINOUS FOR A BET AND PRETTY QUICKLY IT'S APPARENT THAT TIM DOES NOT REMEMBER THE RISE OR FAL OF THEIR FRIENDSHIP AND NEARLY AS MUCH DETAILS GAVE DOES THERE WAS ONE PART THOUG THAT TIM REMEMBERED CLEARLY TIM HAD TRIED AT ONE POINT IN HIS OWN WAY TO MAKE AMENDS A YEAR AFTER THEIR BREAK UP HE'D INVITED GAVE TO A CONCERT WITH MUSIC BY THE COMPOSER EDBARD GREEG WHICH HE CHOSE SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THERE'S THIS ONE SONG IN THAT CONCERT THET MEN A LOT TO BOTH OF THEM WHEN THEY WERE FRIENDS CALLED THE LOST SPRING GAVE FRS INTRODUCE THE SONG TO HIM IN COLLEGE WHEN HE TOOK TIM TO A GREEN CONCERT AND THEN A FEW WEEKS LATER WERE LIKE UP THE THREE  M LIKE PLAGUE THAT YOU GAMES LISTENING TO CLASSICAL MUSIC ON THE RADIA AND THE THE SONG THE LAST SPRING CAME ON ON THE RADIO AND I THIYOU KNOW WE JUST CONTALIC STOP TALKING AND TURNED UP THE MUSIC AND SETHER AND LISTENE TO I BUT AN HIS IS JUST LIKE VERY SPECIAL MOMENT AS I REMEMBER IT THIS WAS A CONTEXT TIM HAT IN HIS HEAD WHEN HE REACHED OUT TO GABE THINKING THAT MAYBE THEY COULD BE FRIENDS AGAIN AS LIKE LET'S GO TO THIS CONCERT TOGETHER IT'S THIS PIECE OF MUSIC THAT LIKE AS IS DEEP RESIDENCE FOR BOTH OF US I AND YOU KNOW MY FEELING WAS THIS IS A GESTURE OF GOOD WILL OF EXTENDING IN ALL BRANCH IN GAVE SAID NOW AND SO AT THAT POINT WAS A  BALAS IN HIS COURT GABE WHEN YOU GOT THAT MESSAGE FROM TIM DID YOU SEE IT AS THE ALL OF FRENCH THAT TIM MEANT IT TO BE I DON'T THINK I SAW IT AS LIKE GO THIS IS TIM PUTTING IT EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE MY PERSPECTIVE WAS LIKE O TIM DOESN'T ONE ACKNOWLEDGE THE HURT HE'S CAUSE HE JUST ONCE TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN WITHOUT HAVING TO DO ANYTHING SI FELT I THINK THAT PERHAPS LIKE MY INVITATION TO YOU TO GO THAT CONCERT I THINK I WAS MAYBE OVERLY RELYING ONLIKE YOU SHOULD FEEL A SENTIMENTAL ABOUT THIS PIECE OF MUSIC AS I DO AND CONNECT IT TO OUR FRIENDSHIP AS MUCH AS I DO AND SO WITHOT ME EXPLAINING IT I REMEMBER FEELING LIKE THE MEETING BEHIND THIS SHOULD BE LIKE SELF EVIDENT SOME THINK TIMAN GABE SEEMED TO HAVIN COMMEN IS A KIND OF MAGICAL THINKING TIM AD HOPE THAT GAVE WOULD UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING HE WAS TRYING TO EXPRESS COMPLICATED FEELINGS LIKE LOVE AND REMORSE AND A STALGA WITH WHAT WAS ESSENTIALLY A LINK TO TICKAT MASTER GAVE HAD EXPECTED HIM TO ROM COMSTYLE UT PEERR UNANNOUNCED ONE NIGHT AT HIS PERFORMANCE WITHOUT EVER ACTUALLY INVITING HIM TO A SHOW OR EVEN TELLING HIM IT EXISTED IT'S LIKE EACH ONE AT ALL THE BENEFIT OF BEING HEARD WITHOUT THE BURDON OF HAVING TO SAY ANYTHING AT ALL THE MAIN THING GAVE ONE AT OUT OF ALL OF THIS WAS AN APOLOGY FOR HOW TIM BROKE THE NEWS TO HIM ABOUT KATE ALL THOSE YEARS AGO HE THINKS OF TIM AD HANDLED IT DIFFERENTLY THEY COULD HAVE STAYED FRIENDS I KNOW THIS IS WHAT HE'S WAVING FOR HE'S TOLD ME ABOUT BUT AN HOUR OF CIRCLING AROUND THE TOPIC GOES BY BEFORE FINALLY GAVE BRINGS IT UP IN A SIDEWAY SORT OF WAY I GUESS WHICH REFUSEI DO YOU WISH THIT IT HAPPENED DFERENTLY OF COURSE OF COURSE I WISHULD AT HALF IT DIFFERENTLY  I IWOUD TELL YOU A THOUSAN PERCENT I FELP BAD ABOUT IT I I TELL YOU FELT ABOUT ABOUT IT BUT IF IM BEING TOTALLY HONEST I REMEMBER THAT CONVERSATION IFFERENTLY WHAT I REMEMBER SAING IS LIKE LESS LIKE I'M NOT SORRY AND MORE IM NOT ASKING YOUR PERMISSION BUT I WHAT I DIDN'T WON WAS FREETED BE LIKE E A TO MA PLEASE ON TO THIS YET I MEAN THAT THAT'S IT'S ILLUMINATING THERE WAS ALWAYS A PART OF ME THAT WANTED YOU BEU LIKE TELL ME LIKE I THINK I'M IN LOVE WITH HER LIKE I DON'T K WANT TO DO AND I IT LEAST MAYBE WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE LIKE TIME I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU WAS A FRIEND YOU'RE COMING TO ME AND I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY AND YIT JUST WHAT ALWAYS WAS FRUSTRATING WAS LIKE IT JUST YOU NEVER IT NEVER FELT LIKE I HAD THE CHANCE TO BE THE BIGGER MAN THAT'S FAIR A THAT'S FARNOW OW OW NO THAT'S FAIR BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT BECAUSE BECAUSE WHAT I SAID AND EVEN WHAT I REMEMBER SAYING LIKE YOU'RE RIGHT IS LIKE IT I SI I N I GUD TO GIVE YOU THE CHISE YES TO TELL ME NOW YE UM OR EAR TO TELL ME YOU KNOW YOU REALLY DON'T WANT ME TO DO THIS UM DO YOU FEEL SORRY ABOUT THAT TIN YET SO WA STO WHAT I DON'T BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T FEEL SORRY FOR IT IS IS LIKE THE FACTS RIGT THE UNDERLIT IND BUT WHAT I AM LEARNING FOR THE FIRST TIME TOIS THAT IT'S NOT IT WASN'T THE FACTS NO OF COURSE  THAT WASN'T THAT AS ELL AND THAT'S  WAIT SO DO YOU FEEL SORRY BUT THE WAY THE FACTS CAME OUT WELL YE NO KNOWING THAT THAT'S THE PROBAB YOA WHY DO YOU SHOULD TELL GAVE THAT I JUST I DID I THINK DIDN'T WE  YOU YOU DN'T SAIY A WORDS I'M SORRY NO I THINK LIKE O BUT I THOUGHT I SAID THAT EARLY EARLIER IN THE CONVERSATION BUT  I AM SORRY FOR THE WAY THAT I BROTH THAT NUSE TO YOU I REALLY PRECIAY SAYM THAT UM YOU TIM IS SO I'VE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME TO HEAR THAT I WAS SURPRISED BY HOW ON EMOTIONAL AN AUNTI CLIMACTIC THE APOLOGY FELL HER TIM WAS SAY ING ALL THE WORDS THAT GABE THAT WANTED SO BADLY TO HEAR AND YET SOMEHOW I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE ALL THAT MUCH AND I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE OF THIS OTHER THING THAT KEPT SURFACNE THROUGHOUT THEIR CONVERSATION IT'S ONE OF THOSE AWKWARD THINGS AND SEEMS BORDERLING CRUEL TO BRING ATTENTION TO BUT I BE REMISSE NOT TO ASK SO NERVOUSLY I DO THEY THINK THAT I CAN'T TELL IS WHAS YOUR FRIENDSHIP AS IMPORTANT TO UE HIM AS IT WAS TO GABE IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME UM I I DO'TKO HAD TO ANSWER THAT I THINK IT WAS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO ME UM I DON'T KNOW THAT IT WAS AS IMPORTANTBUT I DON'T LIKE HE WAS OF OF VERY VERY VERY PORTANT  FRIEND TO ME DO YOUR FRIENDS NOW THAT OCCUPIED THE SPACE THAT GAVE PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED I DO YOU DID I DO NO WE WRAP UP OUR CONVERSATION SHORTLY AFTER THIS BUT THE QUESTION STILL NAGS AT ME SO I ASKED HIM ABOUT IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY WHEN I WAS JUST THE TWO OF US TALKING IT'S A QUESTION LIKE VERY SELF CONSCIOUS ABOUT IT ANSWERING UM WHY BECAUSE I I WOULDN'T SAY LIKE HE WAS A GUY I KNEW LET GES YET HE WAS A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WAS YOUR BEST FRIEND ANY POINT IT'SN SO NOW OAR GETTING INSOLICT THINGS ABOUT LIKE BASKED FRANCE AND INLINGLY BEST RIEND CAN BE A TEER NOT A PERSON THAS RUNS A TEER NT A PERSON HE WAS SO EASY ON THAT TEER SO WHAT I GAVE WAS ON THAT UM TER I LIKE HE WS CERTAINLY CLOSE TO IT I DON'T KNOW OF HOW DROWN ALWAY  IT WAS DARTLING TO SEE THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER LAID SO BARE TIM JUST DIDN'T LOVE GABE AS MUCH AS GABE LEVET HIM AND REALLY AND EMBALANCE IN LAVE ISN'T THAT ULTIMATELY THE REASON THAT ALL RELATIONSHIPSEND I RAN THIS BY GAME HAT MAYBE THERE IS A MISMATCH IN THEIR FEELINGS FOR ONE ANOTHER AND HOW THEY UNDERSTOOD THEIR RELATIONSHIP HE REJECTED THAT IDEA OUTRIGHT SAYS HE WAS THERE HE REMEMBERS WHAT IT FELL LIKE THI IDEA THAT LIKE WE WEREN'T BEST FRIENDS CONSYS HERESY BUT IT'S JUST NOT TRUE BUT IT'S NOT TRUE IN YOUR STORY YE AND I THYES IT COULD BE TRUE IN TINS YEM I JUST DON'T B AND I THINK THAT'S SELF PRELIVISION I THINK A PARD OF ME HAD BEEN JEALOUS THAT TIMAN GAVE GOT THE CHANCE TO COME TO SOME UNDERSTANDING I THING THAT MY AX'S FRIEND MADE CLEAR WAS NOT ON THE TABLE FOR AS BUT IT HADN'T OCCURRED TO ME THAT SITTING DOWN TOGETHER AND REHASHING THINGS MAY NOT LEAD TO SOME SORT OF NEW COMMON GROUND THAT TIN COULD JUST STRIKE A MATCH ON GABE'S MEMORIES AND SAY NO YOURE ON IT WASN'T LIKE THAT I NEVER FELT THAT WAY ABOUT YOU E THATS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TRY TO TALK ITOUT YE NOTHINKS I GUESS THAT THE PROBLEM WHEN YOU WRIE TO ONE MAN SHEL HOPING IT A

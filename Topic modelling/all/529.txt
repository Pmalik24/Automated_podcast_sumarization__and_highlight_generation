WELCOME TO THE HUBERMN LAPO SCIENCE SCIENCE PAE TO RI MANDREW HUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FOR MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AN EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I MLIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS IF LETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASEN I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS ON THEREASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS I GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBIOCS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'LL GIV YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENSIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF WOR GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIEN IN VITEEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK OM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIVFREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE AR SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AN ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOU'R GETTING THE PROPARATIOS OF ELECTROLITES IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THEI'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMEN E DOTCAM SLASH HUBERMAN IT'S A NEW MONTH WHICH MEANS IT'S A NEW TOPIC HERE AT THE HUBERMAN LABPODCAST FOR THE NEXT FOR OR SO EPISODES WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ALL ABOUT HORMON EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN AND BODY SO THAT'S A HUGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TOPICS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SECS WE'RE GING TO TALK ABOUT REPRODUCTION WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT PUBERTY A LITTLE BIT MORE WE TALKED ABOU THAT IN THE PREVIOUS EPISODE WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT MENOPAUS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT BIRTH CONTROL WHERE U ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT A GRESSION COMPETITION WINNING LOOSING BASICALLY WE'RE GOING TO COVER AS MUCH ABOUT HORMONES AS WE POSSIBLY CAIN IN THIS MONTH AND IN DOING SO WE ARE GOING TO GO DEEP INTO TOOLS AND PROTOCALS WE ARE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT A LOT OF TOOLS THAT RELATE TO THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO DO IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE HORMON HEALTH WE'RE GARDLESS OF STAGE OF LIFE FOR YOUR GOALS ET CETERA SO IT'S SURE TO BE AND MONTH RICH WITH DISCUSSION RICH WITH TOOLS AND YOUE IN A LEARN A LOT OF NEROW SCIENCE AND ANDER CHRONOLOGY IS ASHE A FIELD OF NURROW ANDER CHRONOLOGIES THAT SHOUD WHERE I STARTED MY GRADUATE WORK I DID A MASTERS IN IT WHICH IS ONLY TO SAY THAT I LOVE THE TOPIC I'VE A LOT OF FRIENDS THAT WORK ON THIS TOPIC MANY OF WHOM I'VE CONSULTED FOR THESE EPISODES AND I'M REALLY EXCITED TO SHARE THE INFORMATION WITH YOU BEFORE WE DIVE INTO DAY'S EPISODE ALL ABOUT EMOTIONS AND SECS I WANT TO JUST HAVE A FEW ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT OURE DESIGN TO POINT YOU TO SOME USEFUL RESOURCES LAST EPISODE TALKING ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF EMOTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS I MENTIONED THE MOOD METER AP THE MOOD METER AP WAS DEVELOPED BY A PEOPLE OUT AT YALE UNIVERSITY WHO STUDY THE BIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY OF EMOTIONS IT'S A REALLY WONDERFUL AP HOWEVER MANY OF YOU QUICKLY TOLD ME THAT THE MOOD METER AP ISN'T AVAILABLE IN YOUR AREA YOU WENT TO THE LINK WE POSTED AND IT JUST WAS SAYING NOT AVAILABLE IN EUR AREA THE SITUATION WAS ATTULY OT WORSE THAN THAT THE SITUATION WAS THAT WHEN WE RECORDED THE EPISODE THE MOOD METER AP WAS WORKING I KNOW CAUSE I DOWN LOADED AFRESH COPY OF IT TO MY PHONE AND THEN IN THE ENSUING WEEK END THEY TOOK THE MOOD METER AP DOWN FOR SOME REPAIRS THE MOOD METER AP IS NOW UP IT IS AVAILABLE I WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR IT'S NOT AN AP I'M OFFILIATED WITH I'M JUST MENTIONING IT TO YOU THEY DON'T KNOW ME I KNOW THEM BUT THEY DON'T KNOW ME SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP THEY DO CHARGE NINETY NINE CENTS FOR THE AP I'D THINK THE FREE VERSION HAS DISAPPEARED IN IN THE LAST YEAR OR SODE SO THAT'S MOOD METER AP WILL PROVIDE THE LINK AGAIN AND THE LINK SHOULD BE WORKING HOPEFULLY THEY WON'T TAKE IT DOWN AGAIN IN BETWEEN THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND THE RELEASE OF THIS EPISODE ALSO JUST WANT TO TAKE A STEP BACK FOR A MOMENT AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE LOGIC OF HOW TO MAKE THE MOST OF THE INFORMATION ON THE HUBERMAN LABPODCAST I TEND TO THROW A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT A GIVEN TOPIC MANY OF YOU HAFE POINTED OUT HOWEVER THAT I DON'T COVER CERTAIN THINGS AND ONCE AGAIN I'LL JUST SAY THE GOAL L IS ALWAYS TO BE ACCURATE BUT THERE'S NO WAY I CAN BE EXHAUSTIVE THERE'S NO WAY I CAN COVER EVERYTHING FOR PARTICULAR TOPIC THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE TIME MY GOAL AT LEAST IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE HUBERMAN LAB PODCAST IS TO GIVE YOU A BASIS A FOUNDATION IN THIS DIFFERENT TOPICS OF NERL PLASTICITY FOKIS SLEEP HORMONES ET CETERA END OF COURSE TO PROVIDE TOOLS ALONG THE WAY WE ARE GOING TO HOST GUES I'VE ASHLY START RECORDING WITH SOME OF THESE GUESTS ALREADY AND EVEN THOSE EPISODES WILL INCLUDE A LITTLE WHAT WE CALL PRIMER A LITTLE DESCRIPTION OF THE BASICS OF A GIVEN TOPICS SO THAT YOU CAN GET MORE INFORMATION FROM THOSE TOPICS MY GOAL REALLY IS TO EDUCATE YOU IN THESE TOPICS GIVE YOU A FOUNDATION IN THESE TOPICS AND ALLOW YOU TO START EXPLORING THEM HERE IN THE EPISODES WITH OUR FUTURE GUESTS BUT ALSO IN OTHER PODCASTS AND BOOKS AND OTHER SOURCES OF INFORMATION SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THEIR SAYING IT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION I JUST INCOURAGE A YOU TO REMIND YOURSELF THAT YOU HAVE A PAUS BUTTON YOU CAN RETURN TO IT EVERYTHINGS TIME STAMP FOR THOSE YOU FEEL IT'S NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION I'M NOT COVERING ENOUGH JUST NOW THAT THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING WE INTEND TO DO THIS FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND WE WILL BE THOROUGH OVER TIME SO THANKS FOR YOUR PATIENTS AND PLEASE BE PATIENT WITH YOURSELVES THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU HAVE TO DIGEST ALL THE INFORMATION IN ONE SWOOP THE OTHER THING IS THAT I'VE BEEN TOLD BOTH THAT I SPEAK TOO FAST AND SPEAK TOO SLOW SO THERE'S A WONDERFUL SOLUTION TO THIS IF I SPEAK TOO FAST OR TOO SLOW YOU CAN ADJUST THE SPEED IN UTUBE IF YOUR LISTING AND DIFFERENT FORM AT I THINK YOU ALSO CAN ADJUST THE SPEED OF PLAYBAC SO THAT'S A SOMETHING THAT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE IN THE CLASSROOM A BUT YOU MAY FIND USEFUL AND THEN LAST BAT NOT LEAST I WANT A POINT PEOPLE AGAIN TO THIS N S DR NON SLEEP DEEP BREST PROTOCOL THAT THE FOKS OVER IT MADE FOR HAVE PUT OUT AS A FREE RESOURCE IT DOES AS MANY OF YOU POINTED OUT BEAR RESEMBLANCE TO THINGS LIKE YOGANEDRA OTHER FORMS OF MEDITATION BUT WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'V STRIPED OUT INTENTIONS OR ANY KIND OF THE THE A VERBAGE RELATED TO O WHUT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT PERCEIVE AS CAN OF RELATED TO THE YOGET COMMUNITY OR A SPECIFIC TOO KIND OF NEW AGY TYPE TECHNIQUES NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T LIKE OGANDRON FACT IAVE DONE YOGANEDR DAILY FOR ALMOST THE LAST A GOODNESS A EIGHT YEARS OF MY LIFE I LOVE YOGANEDRA BUT SOMETIMES THE COMPLICATED LANGUAGE CAN BE A SEPARATOR AND CAN DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM TAKING ON THESE PROTOCOLS THAT ARE EXTREMELY USEFUL SO N STIARS IS INTENTIONALLY GENERIC IS DESIGN TO BRING YOU INTO A STATE OF DEEP RELAXATION THROUGH A COMMINATION OF BREATHING AND BODY SKIN THERE'S THE YOU TOO SCRIPT OVER AT YOU AT MADE FORT WHICH IS LINKED IN THE CAPTION AND MANY PEOPLE FIND THAT THEY PREFER THAT TO SCRIPTS LIKE YOGENEDR SCRIPTS WHERE THEY'RE DOING INTENTIONS AND THEIRE HEARING A LOT OF OM KIND OF A UNUSUAL LANGUAGE AROUND THE PROCESS THIS IS JUST VERY BASIC AND I HOPE YOU'LL ENJOY IT AND IF YOU PREFER THE MORE TYPICAL YOGANEDROSCRIPTS THAN UM GO WITH THOSE THEY 'RE MANY OF THEM AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNATE AND ELSEWHERE AND LASBA NOT LEAST I WANT A POINT OUT THAT ALL OUR EPISODES NOW ARE SUBTITLED BOTH IN ENGLISH AND IN SPANISH SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT PERFER TO DIGEST THIS INFORMATION IN SPANISH THAT'S NOW AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THE SUBTITLES TO DAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF SECTS IN PARTICULAR SEXTUAL DIFFERENTIATION NOW THAT'S A COMPLICATED TOPIC BECAUSE SEXT IS BOTH A ADJUTIVE ANOWN AND A VERB DEPENDING ON THE CONTECTS TO DAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE HORMONAL EFFECTS AND THE NOURAL EFFECTS OF PARTICULAR EVENTS THAT HAPPENSURING DEVELOPMENT AND HOW THOSE GUIDE ADOLESCENT AND ADULT BEHAVIOR INCLUDING SEXUAL PREFERENCE IT'S AN AREA THAT'S FASCINATING AND FOR WHICH THERE ARE ACTUALLY VERY SOLID TEXT BOOKED FINDINGS SO TEXT BOOK FINDINGS MEANS THAT THERE ARE MANY STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED OVER DECADES THAT POINT TO WHAT WE NOW KNOW TO BE ABSOLUTE TRUTHS IN TERMS OF HOW HORMONES EFFECT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT HOW THE BRAIN IMPACTS HORMONA DEVELOPMENT AND HOW THOSE INTERACT TO CONTROL BEHAVIOR FOR INSTANCE WE ARE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT REPRODUCTION THE VERB SECTS AND OF COURSE SECTS THE VERB CAN ALSO BE CARRIED OUT INDEPENDENT OF REPRODUCTION IT'S NOT ALWAYS IN PARTICULAR IN HUMANS JUST TO PRODUCE OFFSPRING SO THAT'S CAN BE COVERED IN THE NEXT EPISODE BUT YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE INFORMATION IN THIS EPISODE IN ORDER TO MAKE SENSE OF THE INFORMATION IN THE NEXT EPISODE SO TO DAY WE'RE GOING TO EXPLORE HORMONES WHAT THEY ARE HOW THEY WORK WHAT LEADS TO MASCULINIZATION OR FEMINIZATION OF THE BRAIN AND BODY ARE DISTRAWGHT ONE REALLY INTERESTING FACT THAT PERHAPS MOST VIEWD IN REALIZE THAT HORMONES HAVE DIRECT EFFECTS ON THE BODY MOST PEOPLE KNOW THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE HORMONE DIFFERENCES AND SEX DIFFERENCES IN BODIES IN TERMS OF GENITALIA AND BODY HAIR DISTRIBUTION OF BODY HEIR ET CETERA BUT THERE ARE ALSO EFFECTS OF HORMONS ON THE BRAIN DIRECTLY AND BELIEVE ORE NOT THERE ALSO EFFECTS ON THE SPINAL CORD ON THE NURONS AND STRUCTURES WITHIN THE SPINAL CORD THAT IMPACT IN A VERY DIRECT WAY WHAT SORTS OF BEHAVIORS ARE POSSIBLE SO IT'S A FASCINATING AREA YOU MIGHT NOTICE I'M GOING TO GO A LITTLE BIT MORE SLOWLY THROUGH THIS TOPIC THAN I NORMALLY DO I WANT TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WITH MY LANGUAGE SOME OF THESE TOPICTS SOME OF YOU MAY BE THINKING ARE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE RIGHT AND OF COURSE ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT SECTS AND REPRODUCTION IS A SENSITIVE ONE BUT TO DAY WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE BIOLOGY WE'RE NOT GETTING INTO THE CULTURAL CONSTRAINTS OR THE CULTURAL DIALOGUE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO TODAY IS REALLY GET TO THE BIOLOGY THE PHYSIOLOGY THE INDERCHRONOLOGY AND THE BEHAVIOR SO LET'S START BY TALKING ABOUT WHAT HORMONES ARE JUST TO REMIND YOU AND WHAT THEY DO HORMONES BY DEFINITION ARE A SUBSTANCE A CHEMICAL THAT S RELEASED IN ONE AREA THE BODY TYPICALLY FROM SOMETHING WE CALL LIKE GLAND ALTHOUGH THEY CAN ALSO BE RELEASED FROM NORONS BUT THE RELEASED OFTEN FROM GLANDS THAT TRAVEL AND HAVE EFFECTS BOTH ON THAT GLAND BUT ALSO ON OTHER ORGANS AND TISSUES IN THE BODY AND THAT DIFFERENTIATES HORMONES FROM THINGS LIKE NR TRANSMITTERS WHICH TEND ACT MORE LOCALLY SO THAT'S IMPORTANT A HORMONE IS A SUBSTANCE ACRETET ONE LOCATION BODY TRAVELS AND HAS IMPACT ON THINGS ELSEWHERE IN THE BODY EXAMPLES OF TISSUES THAT PRODUCE HORMONES WOULD BE THE PHYROID THE TESTES THE OVERIES ET CETERA AND THEN COURSE THEIR AREAS OF THE BRAIN LIKE THE HYPOPHALYMUS AND THE PETUITARY WHICH ARE CLOSELY RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER AND RELEASE HORMONES THAT CAUSE THE RELEASE OF YET OTHER HORMONES OUT IN THE BODYIES O OR GAN TO COVER ALL THIS IF YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANTER CHRONOLOGY YOU ARE STILL GOING TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND TO DAY'S DISCUSSION AND WE'RE GOING TO START WITH THE DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT HORMONES ACTUALLY DO TO CREATE THIS THING THAT WE CALL MASCULINIZATION OR FEMINIZATION SO LET' START WITH DEVELOPMENT SPERM MEATS EGG EVERYTHING HAPPENS BEFORE THAT IS THE TOPIC OF THE NEXT EPISODE BUT SPERM MEATS EGG THIS IS MAMALIAN REPRODUCTION AND THAT EGG STARTS TO DUPLICATE STARTS TO MAKE MORE OF ITSELF T MAKES MORE CELLS AND EVENTUALLY SOME OF THOSE ELLES BECOME SKIN SOME OF THOSE ELLES BECOME BRAIN SOME OF THOSE ELLES BECOME MUSCLE SOME OF THOSE ELVES BECOME FINGERS ALL THE STUFF THAT MAKES UP THE BRAIN AND BODY PLAN IN ADDITION THERE ARE HORMONES THAT COME BOTH FROM THE MOTHER AND FROM THE DEVELOPING BABY THE DEVELOPING PHETUS THAT IMPACT WHETHER NOT THE BRAIN WILL BE WHAT THEY CALL ORGANIZED MASCULINE OR ORGANIZED FEMININE AND AS I SAY THIS I WANT YOU TO TRYING DIS SCARRED WITH THE CULTURAL CONNOTATIONS ARE YOUR PSYCHOLOGICAL CONOTATIONS OF WHAT MASCULINIZATION AND FEMINIZATION ARE BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY CENTERING ON THE BIOLOGY SO TYPICALLY PEOPLE HAVE EITHER TWO EX CHROMOZOMES AND THE TRADITIONAL LANGUAGE AROUND THAT AS THAT PERSON IS FEMALE RIGHT OR AN EXCHROMOZOME AND A WYCHROMOSOME AND THAT PERSON WILL BECOME MALE NOW IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE THERE ARE CASES WHERE ITS EX EX WY WHERE THERE R TWO EXCHROMOZOMES PLUSAWY CHROMOSOM THEY RE ALSO CASES WHERE IS EX WYWY WHERE THEIRE TWO WY CHROMOSOMES AND THESE HAVE IMPORTANT BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACTS SO THE FIRST THING WE NEED O ESTABLISH IS THAT THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED CHROMOZOMAL SECS WHETHER NOT THEIR TWO EXCHROMOZOMES OR AN EXON WY CHROMOZSOME IS WHAT WE CALL CHROMOZOMA SECTS BUT THE NEXT STAGE OF SEPARATING OUT THE SEXES IS WHAT WE CALL GONATLE SEC TYPICALLY NOT ALWAYS BUT TYPICALLY IF SOMEBODY HAS TESTES FOR THEIRE GONADS WE THINK OF THEM AS MALE AND IF SOMEBODY HAS OVERIES WE THINK OF THEM AS FEMALE ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE EITHER BUT LET'S JUST EXPLORE THE TRANSITION FROM CHROMASOMAL SECS TO GONATLE SECTS BECAUSE IT'S A FASCINATING ONE THAT WE ALL WENT THROUGH IN SOME FORM OR ANOTHER SO THIS EX WY THAT WE TYPICALLY THINK OF AS PROMOTING MASCULINIZATION OF THE PHETUIS WE SAY THAT BECAUSE ON THE WI CHROMAOZONE THERE ARE GENES AND THOSE GENES HAVE PARTICULAR FUNCTIONS THAT SUPPRESS FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS SO ON THE Y CHROMAZONE THERE'S A GENE WHICH IN CODES FOR SOMETHING CALLED MULARIAN INHIBITING HORMONE SO THEREIS ASHIA HORMONE THAT'S PROGRAMME BY THE WYCHROMAZONE THAT INHIBITS THE FORMATION OF MULARIAN DUCS WHICH ARE IN IMPORTANT PART OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE APPARATUS THAT'S CRITICAL BECAUSE ALREADY WERE SEING THE TRANSITION BETWEEN CHROMAZONE WICHROMAOZONE AND GONAD AND OTHER GENES ON THE WICHROMAZONE PROMOTE THE FORMATION OF TESTIS OI THEIR GENES LIKE THE ES ARE WYGENE AND OTHER GENS THAT PROMOTE THE FORMATION OF TESTIS WHILE THEY ALSO INHIBIT THE FORMATION OF THE MULARIAN DUCS SO THE TRANSITION FROM CHROMOZOMAL SEC TO GONATL SEX IS OF VERY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION ITS KIND OF A FORK IN THE ROAD THAT HAPPENS VERY EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT WHILE PETUSES ARE STILL IN THE EMBRIO NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING IS WELL IS THAT JUST BECAUSE THERE IS A WY CHROMAOZONE THAT CAN SUPPRESS MULARIAN DUCT FORMATION IN THEIR OTHER GENES ON THE WI CHROMAZOME THAT PROMOTE TESTI DEVELOPMENT THE PLACENTA ITSELF IS AN ENDICRINE ORGAN I THINK MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS BUT THE PLOCENTA IS AN ENDIRCAN ORGAN AS WELL THE MOTHER WHICH OF COURSE IS CARRYING THE PHEDIS HAS AND A DRENAL GLAND WHICH CAN PRODUCE TESTOSTERONE THERE ARE INSTANCES FOR EXAMPLE WHERE A MOTHER HAS EITHER A TUMER OR FOR SOME OTHER REASON IS SECRETING LARGE LEVELS OF TESTOSTERONE WHILE CARRYING APHETIS THAT IS X X AND THAT LEADS TO WHAT WE WOULL CALL MASCULINIZATION OF CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE PHETUS TYPICALLY OM THAT WOULD BE ENLARGED CLITERUS THERE ALSO SOME EXAMPLES OF OTHER PENATYPES ON THE BODY THAT ARE CREATED EVEN THOUGH IT'S A PURELY EX X CHROMOZOMAL BABY SO WE HAVE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN CHROMOSOMAL SEX GONATL SEX AND THEN THERE IS WHAT WE CALL HORMONAL SEX WHICH IS THE EFFECTS OF THE OF THE STEROID HORMONES ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTRON IN THEIR IN THEIR DERIVITIVES ON WHAT WE CALL MORPHOLOGICAL SEX OR THE SHAPE OF THE BABY IN THE HUMAN AN THE GENITALIA AND THE JAW AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS AND SO E ACTUALLY IS QUITE COMPLICATED SO UNOW IT'S A LONG DISTANCE FROM CHROMAOZOMES TO GENDER IDENTITY AND GENDER IDENTITY HAS A LOT OF SOCIAL OF INFLUENCES EN ROLLS THIS IS AN AREA THAT RIGHT NOW IS VERY DYNAMIC AND IN THE DISCUSSION OUT THERE AS YOU KNOW BUT JUST GETTING FROM CROMOZOMAL SECTS TO WHAT WE WOULD CALL GONATL SECTS WER AND HORMONAL SECTS AND MORE PHILOGICAL SECTS INVOLVES A NUMBER OF STEPS BUT TO DAY WORK IN A TALK ABOUT THOSE STEPS AND THERE SOME FASCINATING THINGS THAT DO INDEED RELATE TO TOOLS DO INDEED RELATE TO SOME IMPORTANT BEHAVIORAL CHOICES IMPORTANT CHOICES ABOUT THINGS TO AVOID WHILE PREGNANT AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE NOT PREGNANT THINGS TO AVOID IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT EVENTUALLY HAVING CHILDREN AND THAT IS NOT TO DRIVE DEVELOPMENT IN ONE DIRECTION OR ANOTHER BUT THERE ARE EXAMPLES WHERE THERE ARE SOME DEDILITERIOUS THINGS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT THAT CAN ACTUALLY NEGATIVELY IMPACT WHAT WE CALL SECTUAL DEVELOPMENT OVERALL REGARDLESS OF CROMOSOMO BACKGROUND SO LET'S GET STARTED WITH THAT LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT HORMONES DO HORMONS GENERALLY HAVE TWO CATEGORIES OF EFFECTS THEY CAN EITHER BE VERY FAST ER THEY CAN BE VERY SLOW THERE ARE HORMONES LIKE CORDESALL AND A DRENALINE WHICH ACT VERY FAST DRENALINE CAN INCREASE YOUR HEART RATE A VERY FAST WHEN SECRETED INTO THE BODY CORTISALL CAN BE A LBIT SLOWER BUT IT' ALSO CAN HAVE SOME VERY FASTD EFFECTS AND THEN THERE ARE HORMONES LIKE WILL WE LIKE TESTASTRON AND ESTROGEN WHICH WE REFER TO AS THE SECT DEROID HORMONES THE SECT STERID HORMONS CAN HAVE QUICK EFFECTS THROUGH SIGNALLING THE MEANING THEY CAN ATTACH TO CELLS AND MAKE THOSE CELLS DO DIFFERENT THINGS THEY CAN HAVE ACTUALLY QUITE QUICK EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN A LOT IF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS BUT THERE ARE SOME VERY FAST EFFECTS OF ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTRONE AS WELL AS LONG TERMOFFECTS THESE MOLECULES FOR THOSE OF THER ARE INTERESTED ARE WHAT CALL LIPOPHYLIC WHICH JUST MEANS THAT THEY LIKE FATTY STUFF THEY CAN ACTUALLY PASS THROUGH FATTY MEMBRANES AND BECAUSE THE OUTSIDE OF CELLS AS WELL AS THE WHAT'S CALL THE NEW CLEAR ENVELOPE WHERE ALL THE DEANA CONTENTS AND STUFFOR ARE STUFFED INSIDE ARE MADE OF A OF A OV LIPID OF FAT THESE STEROID ORMONES CAN ACTULLY TRAVEL INTO CELLS AND THEN GET INTO THE DEBASELY INTERACT WITH THE DEANAE OF CELLS IN ORDER TO CONTROLL GENE EXPRESSION SO THEY CAN CHANGE THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT CELLS WILL BE CALM AND THEY CAN CHANGE THE WAY THAT CELLS FUNCTION IN A LONG TERM WAY AND THAT'S ACTUALLY HOW THE PRESENCE OF THESE GENES LIKE ESARE WHY AND MULERAN INHIBITING HORMON LEAD TO REDUCTIONS OR ELIMINATION I SHOULD SAY OF THINGS LIKE THE MULERIAN DUCS AND PROMOTE INSTEAD WHAT'S CALLED IN MALS THE WOLFIAN DUCTS OR PROMOTE THE A THE DEVELOPMENT OF TESTIES RATHER THAN OVERIESALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THAT HORMONS HAVE SHORT TERM AND LONG TERMOFFECTS AND THE LONG TERMIFECTS ORE ACTUALLY RELATED TO THEIR EFFECTS ON GENES AND HOW THOSE GENES ARE EXPRESSED OR REPRESSED NOT IN  TO PREVENT THEM FROM HAVING PARTICULAR PROTENES MADE SO THESE HORMONES THESE STERID HORMONES ARE EXCEEDINGLY POWERFUL AND IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT MASCULINIZATION OR FEMINIZATION ET CETERA YOU ALSO NEED TO THING ABOUT THE COUNTERPART IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT MASCULINIZING THE BODY OR FEMINIZING THE BODY AND BRAIN IT'S ALSO ABOUT DMASCULINIZING THE BRAIN IN MANY CASES AS HE NORMAL BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF OF A TYPICALLY OF EXCECTS FEMALES AND DEFEMINIZATION THE SUPPRESSION OF CERTAIN PATHWAYS THAT ARE RELATED TO FEMINIZATION OF THE BODY AND BRAIN BUT THERE ARE SOME REALLY FASCINATING TWISTS IN THIS STORY SO I'VE JUST THROWN A LOT OF BIOLOGY AT YOU BUT THIS IS WHERE IT ALL STARTS TO GET INCREDIBLY SURPRISING YOU WOULD THINK THAT IT'S STRAIGHTFORWARD RIGHT YOU HAVE A WICHROMOZONE YOU SUPPRESS THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE PATHWAY LIKE THE LIKE THE MULERIAN DUCS YOU PROMOTE THIS THE DEVELOPMENT OF TESTIS AND THEN TESTIS MAKE TESTAOSTRONE AND THEN IT ORGANIZES THE BRAIN MALE AND IT WANTS TO DO MALE LIKE THINGS AND THEN OF IN FEMALES YOU GET ESTROGEN AND IT WANTS TO DO A FEMALE LIKE THINGS AND EIR QUOTES HIRE UP FOR ALL THIS AND TURNS OUT THAT ISN'T HOW IT WORKS AT ALL HERE'S WHERE IT'S INTERESTING WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE FECTS OF THESE HORMONES TESTOSTRONE AND ESTROGEN ON WHAT ARE CALLED PRIMARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS WHICH ARE THE ONES THAT YOU'RE BORN WITH SECONDARY SEXUAL CCHARACTERISTICS WHICH IS THE ONES THAT SHOW UP IN PUBERITY AND THESE ARE HAPPENING IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND SPINAL CORT SOMEMON A DISENTANGLE ALL THIS FOR YOU BY GIVING YOU SOME EXAMPLES FIRST LET'S TALK ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRIMARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS THE ONES THAT SHOW UP AT BIRTH AND ONE OF THE MORE DRAMATIC EXAMPLES OF THIS IT COMES FROM THE ROLL OF TESTOSTRONE IN CREATING THE EXTERNAL GENITALIA NOW YOU MIGHT THINK IT'S JUST STRAIGHTFORWARD IF THERE'S A TESTIS CAUSE THERE'S HE WICHROMOZOME YOU HAVE GOT A GENE THAT CODES FOR THE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF TESTIS YET TESTOSTRONE AND THE PENIS GROS AND THE BABY IS BORN WIT THE PENIS IAN WHEN THE FIRST THINGS THAT HAPPENS WHEN THE BABY COMES OUT IS THEY LOOK AT THE GENITALIAN THEY TRINE MAKE AN ASSESSIMEN WHETHER NOT IT'S A QOTEBOYRIT'S A QOTE GIRL RIGHT HATS BEEN DONE FOR VERY VERY LONG TIME IN IN THAT THROUGHOUT HUMAN A HISTORY IT TURNS OUT THAT IT'S NOT TESTOSTRONE THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PENUS IN A BABY THAT HAS AN EXCHROMOZOMAN A WICHROMOZONE IT'S A DIFFERENT ANDROGEN ANDROGEN IS JUST A CATEGORY OF HORMONES THAT INCLUDES TESTOSTRONE BUT TESTOSTRONE IS CONVERTED IN THE FEEDUS TO SOMETHING CALLED DIHYDRATESTOSTRONE AND THAT'S ACCOMPLISH THROUGH AN ENZIM CALLED PHIVAL FOR REDUCTAES NOW DIHYDROTESTOSTRONE HAS IMPORTANT EFFECTS LATER IN LIFE TO WE WILL TALK ABOUT THOSE IN FACT O JUST WANT TO KNOW DIHYDROTESTOSTRONE IS WHAT WE WOULD CALL THE DOMINANT ANDROGEN IN MALES IT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR REGRESSION IT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF MUSCULAR STRENGTH IT'S INVOLVED IN BEARD GROWTH AND MALE PATERN BALDNESS WEERE GOINGTO TALK ABOUT ALL OF THAT BUT DIHYDRATESTOSTRONE HAS POWER POWERFUL EFFECTS IN DETERMINING THE GENITALIA WHILE THE BABY IS STILL IN THE EMBREO SO THIS ENDS THERE'S TESTOSTRONE THAT'S MADE AND THAT TESTOSTRONE GETS CONVERTED BY THIS ENZIM FIVE AFER DUCTAS IN A LITTLE STRUCTR CALLD THE TUBERICAL THAT TUBERICAL WILL EVENTUALLY BECOME THE PIENUS SO YOU SAYOCE STRAIGHTFORWARD THIS TESTOSTRONES CONVERTED TO DIHAER TESTOSTRONE AND THEN IF THERE'SDAHADER TESTOSTRONIC CONTROLS PENIS GROWTH AND INDEED THAT'S THE CASE SO THAT'S A PRIMARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTIC THAT BABY WILL THEN GROW UP AND LATER DURING PUBERTY THERE WILL BE THE RELEASE OF A MOLECULA TALKED ABOUT THIS LAST EPISODE CALLD KISPEPTIN CAI SES P  P P IAN KISPEPTIN WHICH WILL CAUSE THE RELEASE OF SOME OTHER HORMONES CANATROMRELEASING HORMONE LUTINIZING HORMAN WILL STIMULATE THE TESTIS TO MAKE TESTOSTRONE SO IN PUBERTY TESTOSTRONE LEADS TO FURTHER GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE PENIS AS WELL AS THE ACCUMULATION OF OR GROWTH OF PUBICARE THA DEEPENING IN THE VOICE ALL THE SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS KE SO DIHADRA TESTOSTERONE DECREATES WHAT WE WUD CALL THE THE TYPICAL MASCULINE PHENATYPE FOR PRIMARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS AND PRODUCIS THE TESTOSTRONESCUSME PRODUCES SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS DURING PUBERTY THERE'S A VERY INTERESTING PHENOMENON THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES FOR WHICH NOW THERE'S A WEALTH OF SCIENTIFIC DATA AND THIS RELATES TO A GENETIC MUTATION WHERE FIVEALFOR REDUCTASE THE ENZIME THAT CONVERTS TESTOSTERONE TO DIHAGERTESTOSTRONE DOESN'T EXIST IT'S MUTATED IN AWAY IN A GENOME THAT IT DOESN'T EXIS AND THIS ACCIWAS FIRST IDENTIFIED IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC IT HAS SHOWN UP ELSEWHERE IT'S QUITE RARE BUT WHERE IT SHOWS UP ITS ROBUST WHAT HAPPENS IS BABY IS BORN TYPICALLY WHEN A BABY IS BORN THEY DON'T MEASURE CHROMAZOMES THEY DON'T LOOK AT CHROMAZOMAL SEX EX EXER EXUA THAT'S NOT TYPICALLY DONE NOWADAYS BABY IS BORN FUWERE TA LOOK AT THAT BABY IT WOULD LOOK FEMALE THERE WOULD BE VERY LITTLE OR NO EXTERNAL PIENIS AND SO PE WOULD SAY IT'S A GIRL AND THEY MIGHTS YOU KNOW HOW THE CELEBRATION IT'S A GIRL AND I GUESS NOW THEY CALL THEM GENDER REVEAL PARTIES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS BUT OM A ANYWAY THEY WOULD REVEAL THAT THA THE BABY WOULD REVEAL IT'S A ITS EXTERNAL GENITALIA SIMPLY BY BEING THERE BEING NAKED WHEN IT'S BORN HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GENDER IT HAS TO DO WITH GENITALIA AND SEX THAT BABY WOULD BE BORN AND WHAT WAS OBSERVED IS THAT FROM TIME TO TIME THAT BABY AFTER BEING RAISED AS A GIRL PERFECTLLY HAPPY AS A GIRL WOULD AROUND THE AGE OF ELEVEN OR TWELVE OR THIRTEEN WOULD SUDDENLY START TO SPROUT A PENIS THERE'S ATIAN NAME FOR THIS IS CALLED UEVIDOSS WHICH THE TRANS LATION IS MORE OR LESS PINUS AT TWELVE AND AS STRANGE AS THIS MIGHT SOUND IT MAKES SENSE IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING MUTATION WHAT HAPPENS IN THESE CHILDREN THESE HUEVIDOSIS IS THAT THE CHILD IS BORN IT HAS TESTES WHICH ARE NOT DESSENDED SO UP IN THE BODY THEYRE NOT MAKING A LOT OF TESTOSTERONE EARLY ON THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO CONVERT TESTOSTRONE TO DIHYDRO TESTOSTRON BECAUSE THEY LACK THI ENZIN FIVE ALFOR DUCTIES AS A CONSEQUENCE THE PRIMARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTIC OF EXTERNAL MALE GENITALIA PENIS DOESN'T DEVELOP AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THE BABY GROWS UP AS A YOUNG CHILD ESSENTUALLY AS IS TREATED AS A GIRL  GENERALLY THEY REPORT BEING PRETTY COMFORTABLES AS AS GIRLS ALTHOUGH NOT ALWAYS AND THEND TESTOSTRONE STARTS GETTING SECRETED FROM THE TESTES CAUSE CESPEPTON IN THE BRAIN SIGNALS THROUGH GANATROPENAN LUTINIZING HARMON TRAVELS DOWN TO THE TESTIS THE TESTIS START CURNING OUT TESTOSTRONE AND THERE'S A SECONDARY GROWTH OF THE PENIS AND ALL SUDDEN THERE'S A PENIS AND THIS LEADS TO SOME VERY COMPLICATED SITUATIONS IN FAMILIES AND CULTURALLY AND ATUALLY THE OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF WHETHER NOT THESE CHILDREN DECIDE TO SELF IDENTIFY AS MALES OR FEMALES AND HOW PEOPLE TREAT THEM ASHUALLY VARIES QUITE A LOT THERE'S ACTUALLY BEEN A KIND OF A A ADOPTING OF A THIRD CATEGORY OF SEXINGENDER IN THE SUEVIDOSIS FOR IN ORDER TO JUST OFFER THEM OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO A EXPLORER NOT JUST WHAT WOULD BE A TYPICAL KIND OF GIRL OR WOMAN OR BOY OR MAN PHINATYPE BUT SOMETHING IN BETWEEN SOMETHING THAT SOME PEOPLE CALL INTERSEX ALTHOUGH INTERSECTS AND SEUDOHERMAPHRODITISM IS ACTUALLY A SEPARATE THING ALTOGETHER SO ITS FASCINING IN THE POINT HERE IS THAT DIHYDRATESTOSTRONE NOT TESTOSTRONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS PRIMARY GROWTH OF THE PENIS AND THAT TESTOSTRONE LATER IS INVOLVED IN THE SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS DEEPENING IN THE VOICE ET CETERA NOW THIS IS WHERE THE INFORMATION GETS EVEN MORE INTERESTING AND APPLIES TO ESSENTUALLY EVERYBODY YOU MIGHT THINK THAT TESTOSTRONE BECAUSE IT MASCULINIZES THE BODY IN THESE IN THE SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTIC WAY AND BECAUSE DIHYDRA TESTOSTERONE ANOTHER ANDROGEN MASCULINIZES THE PRIMARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS THE GROWTH OF THE PINIS EARLY ON THAT TESTOSTRONE MUST MASCULINIZE THE BRAIN AND THERE ARE IN FACT ASPECTS OF MASCULINIZATION OF THE OF THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT ARE INDEPENDENT OF GENITALIA NOW MIGHT BE OBVIOUS TO SOME OF YOU BUT SOME PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T REALIZE THAT YES INDEED THE BRAIN HAS RECEPTERS FOR TESTOSTERONE IT ALSO AS RECEPTERS FOR ESTROGEN BUT THE FASCINATING THING IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT TH E BRAINS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE WY CHROMAZOMES AND THAT HAVE TESTESAND THAT MAKE TESTOSTRON AND YOU LOOK AT THE BRAINS OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE WY CHROMAZOMES OR TESTIS AND THEREFORE MAKE FAR LESS TESTOSTROE IN GENERAL WHAT YOU REALIZE IS THAT THE SELLS IN THE BRAIN THAT DIFFER BETWEEN WHAT I'LL CALL MALES AND FEMALES BUT BETWEEN EXUI AND EXEX HAVE RECEPTERS FOR TESTOSTRONE BUT THE MASCULINIZATION OF THE BRAIN IS NOT ACCOMPLISHED BY TESTOSTRON I WON AR REPEAT THIS THE MASCULINIZATION OF THE BRAIN IS NOT ACCOMPLISHED BY TESTOSTRO IT IS ACCOMPLISHED BY ESTROGEN TESTOSTRONE CAN BE CONVERTED INTO ESTROGEN BY AN ENIME CALLED A ROMATIS THIS IS VITALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND TESTOSTRONE CAN BE CONVERT INTO ESTROGEN BY SOMETHING CALED THE ROMATIS I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE THIS HAPPENS LATER IN LIFE TO JUST ILLUSTRATE THE PRINCIPLE AND REALLY IMBEDDED IN YOUR MIND DURING PUBERITY IN BOYS EXUY CHROMAZOME INDIVIDUALS IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR THEIR TO BE TRANSIENT OR SOMETIMES LONGLASTING BREASTBOD DEVELOPMENT TESTOSTRONE GOES UP DURING PUBRITY THE REASONS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE AND SOME OF THAT TESTOSTRONE GETS CONVERTED INTO ESTROGEN BY AN ENZIM CALLED A ROMATIS A ROMATASE IS MADE BY SEVERAL SOURCES IN THE BODY ONE OF THE MAIN SOURCES IS BODY FAT SO IT CAN MAKE A LOT OF A ROMATIS SOMETIMES YOU'LL EVEN SEE OF FAIRLY DRAMATIC BREAST DEVELOPMENT IN MALES DURING PUBRITY SOMETIMES ITS TRANSIENT SOMETIMES ITS NOT THE OTHER PLACE WHERE YOU SEE THIS IS IN ATHLEDS AND BODY BUILDERS THAT TAKE A LOT OF ANABOLIC STEROIDS THAT TAKE HIGH LEVELS OF ANDROGENS SO THEY'LL BE TAKING TESTOSTRONE AT SUPERPHYSIOLOGICAL DOSES SOMETIMES NOT ALWAYS THEY WILL CONVERT SOME OF THAT TESTOSTRONE INTO ESTROGEN AND THE'LL GET WHAT'S CALLED GINA CAMASTIA WHICH IS THAT DEVELOPMENT OF MALE BREASTISSUE SOMETIMES THEY'LL GET IT CUT OUT SURGICALLY OTHER TIMES THEY'LL START TRYING TO TAKE ESTROGEN BLOCKERS IN ORDER TO JOIN SUPPRES IT OR THEY'L TRYIME BLOCK BLOCK PROLACTIN IT'S THE TOPIC THAT WEREGON TO GET INTO IN MORE DETAIL BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE IS TO UNDERSTAND THAT TESTOSTRO CAN BE CONVERT INTO ESTROGEN BY A ROMATIS A ROMATATE IS NOT JUST MADE IN BODY FAT THERE ARE NURONS IN THE BRAIN THAT MAKE A ROMATISE AND CONVERT TESTOSTRONE INTO ESTROGEN AND IT IS TESTOSTRONE CONVERTED INTO ESTROGEN IN OTHER WORDS ITS ESTROGEN THAT MASCULINIZES THE EX WHY INDIVIDUAL THAT MASCULINIZES THE BRAIN AND THIS HAS PROFOUND EFFECTS ON ALL SORTS OF THINGS ON BEHAVIOR ON OUTLOOK IN THE WORLD ET CETERA BUT I THINK MOST PEPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT IT'S ESTROGEN THAT COMES FROM TESTOSTRONE THAT MASCULINIZES THE MALE BRAIN THE EXUY BRAIN NOT TESTOSTRONE NOR DIHYDRATESTOSTRONE SO JUST WANT TO MENSION SOME TOOLS YOU MIGHT BE HASKING YOURSELF HOW COULD TOOLS POSSIBLY COME UP AT THIS STAGE OF THE CONVERSATION WERE WERE TALKING ABOUT SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT AND WERE TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENTIATION OF TISSUES IN THE BODY THIS IS TRUE BOTH FOR CHILDREN AND PARENTS AND ADULTS I WANT O EMPHASIZE THAT THERE R E ARE THINGS THAT ARE ENVIRONMENTAL AND THERE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE USE THAT IN THEIR HOMES SOMETIMES THAT ASHICAN IMPACT HORMONE LEVELS END CAN IMACT SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT IN FAIRLY PROFOUND WAYS AND I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THIS IS NOT A ME PULLING FROM SOME RARE JOURNAL HAVE NEVER HEARD OF IT THIS IS PULLING FROM TEXT BOOKS AND PARTICULAR TO DAY I'M GUIDING A LOT OF CONVERSATION ON A WORK THAT ON BEHAVORAL UNDER CRONOLOGY AS A BOOK BY A RANDY NELSON AND ON LANCE CRICKFIELD EX TRUE EXPERTS IN THE FIELD I'MEN TO TALK ABOUT SOMEOF THE WORK FROM TYERON HAZE AT FROM USEE BERKLY ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS AND THEIR IMPACTS ON SOME OF THESE THINGS LIKE TESTOSTRON IN ESTROGEN I'M N A TOUCH IN TO THEM THERE I MEN IT GIVE SOME ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT'S GROUNDED IN STUDIES WHICH WE A PROVIDE IN THE CAPTION OR THAT ALL REFERENCE HERE ONE OF THOSE THAT'S ASHL REALLY A INTERESTING BUT HELPS ILLUSTRATE THE PRINCIPLE THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IS A FEW YEARS AGO THRE WAS A LOT OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT EVENING PRIMROSE OIL EVENING PRIMROSE OIL IS IN A LOT OF PRODUCTS THAT TYPICALLY OR ASSOCIATE WITH SKIN BEAUTY AND SKIN HEALTH AND SO I'M GENERALIZING HERE BUT O TYPICALLY IT WAS MOTHERS OR SISTERS THAT WERE USING IT AND THERE WERE ACTUALLY EXAMPLE STARTING TO CROP UP OF YOUNG BOYS GETTING ECCELERATED BREASTBUD DEVELOPMENT FROM CONT SKIN CONTACT WITH WOMEN WHO WERE USING EVENING PRIMROSE OIL SO EVENING PRIMROSE OIL IS CHEMICALLY A LOT LIKE ESTROGEN AND HAS A LOT OF ESTROGENIC COMPOUNDS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS OUT THERE LIKE THIS SO BELIEVER NOT THINGS LIKE PINE POLEN LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE TESTOSTRONE STRUCTURELY THEY ARE MORE OR LESS ARE TESTOSTRONE THEIRE BIOOFAILABILITY IN HUMANS ISN'T AS CLEAR EVENING PRIMROSE OIL HAS A LOT OF ESTROGENIC ELEMENTS TO IT JUST STRUCTURELY HOW IT'S BUILT AND SO THERE WERE CASES WHERE BOYS WHERE UNDERSTANDABLY IN KNOW BEING HUGGED BY THEIR MOMOR MAYBE EVEN LIKE SHOWERING AND AND TAKING A O OU KNOW USING THE EVENING PRIMROSE OIL SOLUTION THOSE THINGS WILL ACTUALLY CHANGE LEVELS OF ESTROGENS IN BOYS EN GIRLS AND SO THIS WASN'T JUST AN ISSUE FOR YOUNG BOYS AS WAS ALSO IN ISSUE FOR YOUNG GIRLS SO A IT'S NOT THAT EVENING PRIMROSE OIL IS BAD IT'S JUST THAT A MANY OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT THE DANGERS OF SOYS AND ICE AFFLAVONES AND THINGS LIKE THAT THE IMPACT OF SOY ON ESTROGEN LEVELS IS ARE A THERE ARE SOME DECENT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT HOWEVER ITHERE'S A LOT OF OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE MORE SEVERE AND ONE OF THOSE IS THIS EVENING PRIMROSE OIL SO REGARDLESS OF AGE IF A LET JUST PUT IT THIS WAY BECAUSE PEOPLE MIGHT BE WANTING TO DRIVE THEIR HORMONES MORE EST ROGENIC OR MORE ANDROGENIC SA HOW COULD I KNOW WHICH WHAT YOUR PREFERENCE IS I DON'T KNOW BUT IN ANY CASE THINGS LIKE PREVEN IN PRIMROSE OIL CAN ACTUALLY PROMOTE ESTROGENIC PATHWAYS IN THE BODY AND SOME OF IT CAN GO TRANSGERMAL LIKEWISE BECAUSE TESTOSTERAL REPLACEMENT THERABE IS FAIRLY WIDE SPREAD NOWADAYS AND SOME PEOPLE ACCOMPLISH THAT THROUGH CREAM IT'S PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT IF SOME ONE'S TAKING THAT THAT THEY WANT TO AVOID CONTACT WITH ANY ONE TA SKIN CONTACT WITH ANY ONE THAT IS TRYING TO PROMOTE A MORE ESTROGENIC A ACTIVITY IN THEIR BODY A IN ANESPECIALLYIN CHILDREN SO THAT'S ONE THE OTHER IS THIS ISSUE OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS NOW THIS YO AGAN IMON JUST IN A HIGHLIHT WHEN ONE STARTS TALKING ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND HOW THEIR POISONING A SORT OF DISRUPTING GROWTH OR FERTILITY RATES IT CAN START TO SOUND A LITTLE BIT CRAZY EXCEPT WHEN YOU START ACTUALLY LOOK AT SOME OF THE REAL DATA DATA FROM QUALITY RESEARCH LABS FUNDED BY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FUNDED NOT FROM COMPANIES OR OTHER SOURCES THAT ARE REALLY AIMED AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE UNDERLYING BIOLOGY IS AND FOR THAT I I REALLY WE WE SHOULD ALL BE GRATEFUL TO TYRONE HAZE A AT YOU SEE BERK THEY REMEMBER WAYBACK WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT IN THE A LATE NINETIES GOODNESS A AT YOU SEE BERKLA AND I REMEMBER IN HE WAS STUDDING FROGS HE WAS TALKING ABOUT DEVELOPMENTAL A DEFECTS IN THESE FROGS THAT LIVE IN DIFFERENT WATERS AROUND IT WAS CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO ELSEWHERE A AND HE IDENTIFI A SUBSTANCE WHICH IS PRESENT IN A LOT OF WATER WAYS THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY AND OTHER COUNTRIES SO YOU ESSEN AND AND BEYOND CERTAINLY NOT JUST RESTRICTED CALIFORNIA WHICH IS ATROZNE THIS IS A T ARE A Z I ANI AGAIN THIS IS THE STUFF OF TEXT BOOKS ND IT CAUSES SEVERE TESTICULAR MALFORMATIONS SO AGAIN ATROZINE EXPOSURE IS SERIOUS AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT AT SIGHTS IN WESTERN AND MIDWESTERN SECTIONS THE UNITED STATES TEN TO NINETY TWO PER CENT OF MALE FROGS THESE WERE FROGS MIND YOU HAD TESTICULAR ABNORMALITIES AND THE MOST SEVERE TESTICULAR MALFORMATIONS A WERE IN THE TESTES RATHER THAN IN THE SPERM SO ITACTALY THE ORGAN ITSELF THE GONAT ITSELF NOW IT'S VERY WELL KNOWN NOW THAT ATROZINE IS IN MANY ERBICIDES AND SO YOU KNOW WHEREAS I WOULD SAY IN THE AIGDIES AN NINES THE DISCUSSION AROUND YOU NOW ERBICIDES AN THEIR NEGATIVE EFFECTS WAS CONSIDERED KIND OF LIKE HIPPY DIPPY STUFF FOR THE STUFFY HEREABOUT IT A YOU KNOW THE YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITY MARK ITS AN THE THESE CON OM NEW AGY COMMUNITIES NOW THERS VERY SOLID DATA FROM FEDERALLY FUNDED LABS AT MAJOR UNIVERSITIES THAT AVE IMPERVIEWED IN PUBLISH IN EXCELLENT JOURNALS SHOWING THAT INDEED MANY OF THESE ERBICIDES CAN HAVE NNEGATIVE EFFECTS PRIMARILY BY IMPACTING THE RATIOS OF THESE HORMONES IN EITHER THE MOTHERS OR IN THE THE THE TESTES ALTERING THE TESTIES OF THE FATHERS OR DIRECT EFFECTS ON DEVELOPING YOUNG ANIMALS AND POTENTIALLY HUMANS AND SO ASCAL WHAT ABOUT HUMANS FROGSER ARE WONDERFUL BUT WHAT ABOUT AND WHAT ABOUT HUMAN SO HERE ARE THE DATA ON WHAT'S HAPPENING A AND A THIS IS AN ALL GON TO BE SCARY STOFFOR ELSIGAAN TALK ABOUT A TOOLS TO AMELIORATE AND OFFSET SOME OF THESE EFFECTS ONE WOULD BE BE CAUTIOUS WITH EVENING PRIMROSE AS WELL AS TOSTOSTRONE CREAMS DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT YOU WONT TO BE MORE ANDROGENIC OR ESTROGENIC A IT DEPENDING ON YOUR NEEDS BUT A CROSS HUMAN POPULATIONS SPERM COUNTS ARE INDEED DECLINING SO IN NINETEEN FORTY THE AVERAGE A THE AVERAGE GENCY OF HUMAN SPERM WAS ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN MILLION PERMILLA LEADER OF SEAMEN THAT'S HOW IT'S MEASURE HOW MANY SPERM PER MILA LEADER OF SEAMAN IN NINETEEN NINETY THIS FIGURE HAS DROPPED TO SIXTY SIX O ONE FROM A HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN MILLION PEREMIL LEADER TO SIXTY SIX MILLION PER MIL LEADER IN THE UNITED STATES AND WESTERN EUROPE SAYS NOT JUST TE UEST THING RESEARCHES AL ALSO ESTIMATE THAT THE VOLUMOSEMEN PRODUCED BY MEN HAS DROPPED TWENTY PER CENT IN THAT TIME REDUCE PERM COUNT PERJACULATION EVEN FURTHER SO BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE AND NINETEEN NINETY ONE THE RATIO OF NORMAL SPERMATIGENESIS HAS DECREASED FROM FIFTY SIX POINT FOUR PER CENT TO TWENTY SIX POINT NINE PER CENT SO THERE'S A LOT THAT'S HAPPENING PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THESE ERBECIDES THET ERMWIS SPREAD USE TO REDUCE SPERM COUNTS AND THESE ARE GOING TO HAVE PROFOUND EFFECTS NOTUSON SPIRM COUNTS BUT ON DEVELOPMENT SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT AT THE LEVEL OF THE GONADS AND THE BRAIN BECAUSE YOU NEED TESTOSTRONE TO GET A DIHYDROTISTOSTRONE FOR PRIMARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS YOU NEED ESTROGEN THAT'S COME FROM TESTOSTERONE TO MASCONIZE THE BRAIN AND OF COURSE WE'RE NOT JUST FOCUSSING ON SPERM AND TESTOSTRONES YOU OF COURSE ALSO NO THAT MANY THESE ARE BESIDES ARE DISRUPTING ESTROGENS IN A SIMILAR WAY OR ARE LEADING TO HYPERESTROGENAT A ESTROGENI EXCUSE ME STATES WHICH MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY PUBERTY IS HAPPENING SO MUCH EARLIER IN YOUNG GIRLS THESE SDAYS SO THERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING NOW DOES THIS MEAN THAT YOU HAVE TO RUN AROUND AND NERADICALLY A AVOID ANYTHING THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE ATROSENE AND SHOULD YOU BE AVOIDING ALL KINDS OF ERBECIDES I DON'T KNOW THAT'S UP TO YOU BUT IT DOES SEEM THAT THESE HAVE PRETTY MARKET EFFECTS IN BOTH THE ANIMAL STUDIES AND IN IN THE HUMAN STUDIES BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN OPEN UP A TEXBOOK LIKE THE ANTROCONOLOGY TEXTBOOK AND THAND FIND THINGS LIKE VINCLOSALIN THIS IS V I N C L O Z O L I AND WHICH IS A FUNGICIDE AND IT'S AN ANTI ANDROGEN YOU GIVE IT TO ANIMALS TO RATS AND INSTEAD OF FORMING APENISTHEY DON'T FORM OPIENUS THEY BASICALLY IT'S NOT THAT THEY FORM A A A CLITERUS THEY JUST DON'T FORM OPENIS SO LET'S TALK ABOUT FEMALE SEC UAL DEVELOPMENT AND AS ALWAYS WHAT WILL DO AS WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE NORMAL BIOLOGY THEN WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT A KIND OF OF EXTRAR ORDINARY OR UNUSUAL SET OF CASES BUT WELL TALK ABOUT THEM BECAUSE THEY ILLUSTRATE AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE ABOUT HOW THINGS WORK UNDER TYPICAL CIRCUMSTANCES SO THERE IS A MUTATION CALLED ANDROGEN IN SENSITIVITY CYNDRUM AND UNDERSTANDING HOW ANDROGEN IN SENSITIVITY CSYNDRUM WORKS CAN HELP YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW HORMONES IMPACT SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT HERE'S OUT WORKS THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EX WHY SAID  WICHROMOZON THEY ARE BORN THAT MAKE TESTOSTRONE THEY HAVE TESTES AND THEY DON'T HAVE MULARIAN DUCS BECAUSE THEY BECAUSE ON THE WICHROMOZOMAS THIS MULARIAN INHIBITING HORMON HOWEVER THESE INDIVIDUALS LOOK COMPLETELY FEMALE AND IN GENERAL THEY REPORT FEELING LIKE GIRLS WHEN THEIR YOUNG WOMEN WHEN THEY'RE OLDER BUT THERE'S SOMETHING UNUSUAL THAT'S HAPPENING IN THESE INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN EXTS WHY CHROMOZOMA TYPE AND NOT EXECTS SO WHAT'S HAPPENING WE WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE TESTIES ARE MAKING TESTOSTRONE BUT THEY RECEPTER FOR TESTOSTRONE IS MUTATED AND THEREFORE THE TESTIES NEVER DESCEND THEY DON'T HAVE OVERIES THEY HAVE TESTES BUT THE TESTIES ARE INTERNAL AND SO TYPICALLY THESE INDIVIDUALS FIND OUT THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY EX WYCHROMOZOME SO THAT YOU KNOW THEIRE CHROMOZOMAL SEXS IS MALE IF YOU WILL AND THEIRE GONATTAL SEXS IS MALE BUT THEY DON'T ADDS THE TESTIES ARE INSIDE THE BODY THEY DON'T ACTUALLY DEVELOP A SCROTUM THEY DON'T MAKE OVERIES AND WHEN THEY DON'T MENSTRATE AROUND THE TIME OF PUBERTY THAT'S A SIGN THAT SOMETHING IS DIFFERENT AND SO THEY NEVER MENSTRATE AROUND PUBERTY AND IF THEY LOOK INTO THIS DEOPLY ENOUGH WHEL YOU FIND IS THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY EX WHY THEY MAKE TESTOSTRONE BUT THEIR BODY CAN'T MAKE USE OF THE TESTOSTRONE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE RECEPTORS THE RECEPTORS ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR SOME FOR MOST ALL OF THE SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BODY HAIR PENIS GROWTH THAT DURING PUBERTY ET CETERA THEY LIVE FAIRLY HAPPY LIVES AS FEMALES OTHOUGH COURSE THEY CAN'T CONCEIVE RITE THEY DON'T HAVE A UTERISTS THEY DON'T HAVE OVERIES AM THEY ALSO IN GENERAL DON'T PRODUCE SPERM AT IN QUANTITIES ENOUGH THAT THEY COULD ACTUALLY A REPRODUCE TO SOMEBODY ALSO THOUGH SOMETIMES THEY CAN AND BELIEVE ARE NOT AND I'M NOT IN I NAME NAMES BUT THERE ARE ACTUALLY REPORTS OF SEVERAL OF PEOPLE A FAIRLY PROMINENT PEOPLE THROUGHOUT HISTORY WHO HAVE HAD THIS ANDROGEN AN SENSITIVITY CYNDRUM OR PEOPLE SUSPECTED THEY DID AND THE REASON TO NOT NAME NAMES IS THAT IT GETS RIHTE TO THE HEART OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE MALE OR FEMALE HOW HOW COULD YOU SAY RIGHT THEY HAVE EX WY CHROMOZOMES UT GO NADLY THEY HAVE TESTIES THAT ARE INSIDE AND YET IF YOU LOOKED AT THEIR BODIES IF YOU LOOKED AT THEIR THEIR FACES YOU WOULD SAY ALMOST WITH CERTAINTY THAT THEY WERE THAT THEY APPEARED FEMALE AND THAT EXNATURALLY OCCURRING EXPERIMENT POINTS TO THE FACT THAT TESTOSTRON THAT SHOWS UP IN THE BODY AND IMPACTS THE THINGS AT THE LEVELS OF THE RECEPTER HAS A PROFOUND EFFACT ON PINA TYPE ON THE EXTERNAL OR A BODY PLAN SO AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS IN ORDER TO ILLUSTRATE THE PRINCIPLE THAT IN ORDER TO HAVE ITS EFFECTS A HORMON DOESN'T JUST HAVE TO BE PRESENT THAT HORMON ACTUALLY HAS TO BE ABLE TO BIND ITS RECEPTER AND TAKE ACTION ON THE TARGET CELLS AND ONCE AGAIN I'LL JUS THROUGHOUT THE EXAMPLE OF WHERE PEOPLE ARE ARE USING PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS ALTHOUGH THAT'S A PRETTY BROAD STATEMENT NOWDAYS THERE'S A LOT OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE SO CALLED PSARMS WHICH IS MODIWHICH ARE MORE ON THE RECEPTER SIDE AND SO WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS IN A FUTURE EPISODE A AND I JUST SAY THEREIS A TEESER BECAUSE THE PSARMS AND WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN AUGMENTING SPORTS PERFORMANCE BOTH WITH TESTOSTRONE DIRECTLY BUT ALSO TESTOSTERON DRIVATIVES AND THEN ALSO ALTERING THINGS AT THE LEVEL OF THE RECEPTER IS EXCEEDINGLY INTERESTING AND IS A ILL REVEALING TO US THE MANY WAYS IN WHICH HORMONTS CAN IMPACT BRAIN AND BODY IN WAYS THAT WE DIDN'T SUSPECT PERHAPS THE SIMPLEST WAY TO UNDERSTAND HOW ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTERONE IMPACT MASCULINIZATION OR FEMINIZATION OF THE BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR IS FROM I A STATEMENT IS ACUALLY THE CLOSING SENTENCE OF AN ABSTRACT THAT MY COLLIGUE NARALSHA AT STEMPHORD SCHOOL MEDICINE A PUBLISHED WHICH IS THAT ESTROGEN AGAIND ITS ESTROGEN THAT IS A ROMATIZED FROM TESTOSTERONE BY A ROMATIS SETS UP THE MASCULINE REPOTUIR OF SEXUAL AND IN ANIMALS AND INHUMANS TERRITORIAL BEHAVIORS SO IT SETS UP THE CIRCUITRY IN THE BRAIN ESTROGEN DOES THAT ESTROGEN SETS UP THE MASCULINE CIRCUITRY IN THE BRAIN AND TESTOSTERON IS THEN WHAT CONTROLS THE DISPLAY OF THOSE BEHAVIORS LATER IN LIFE AND I FIND THAT INCREDIBLY INTERESTING YOU WOULD THINK IT WAS JUST TESTOSTERON DID ONE THING AN ESTROGEN TO ANOTHER BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT NATURE IS FAR MORE INTERESTING THAN THAT O CASA WHATERSOME THINGS THAT IMPACT SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT EARLY IN LIFE AND LATER IN LIFE LET'S TALK ABOUT CANABAS LET'S TALK ABOUT ALKOHOL AIND THERE I SAY LET'S TALK ABOUT SELPHONES SOMETHING THAT I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD EVER DO EITHER IN THIS PODCASTERIN THE CLASERUM BUT THESE DAYS THERE ARE REALLY INTERESTING DATA AND I THINK HOEU SHOULD BE AWARE OF THEM FIRST OF ALL CANABAS MARUANA T H C I REALIZE THAT THERE NOW A LOT OF DIFFEREN VARIANCE ON THIS THEIR LOT IFEREN STRAINS OF CANABAS A I PERSONALLY AM NOT A PO SMOKER I JUS NOT NOT FOR ME I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT THE MORAL OR LEGAL IMPLICATIONS YOU KNOWIN SOME STATES ITS DECRIMINALIZE IN OTHER PLACES ITS REALLY LEGAL IN OTHER PLACES ITS BASICALLY LEGAL YOU HAVE TO CHECK AT YOU KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE AND UNDERSTAND THE LAWS THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT WHAT WE DO KNOW HOWEVER IS THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE STUDY THERE ARE MANY STUDIES THAT POINT TO THE FACT THAT T H C AND OTHER THINGS INCANABAS PROMOTE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN A ROMATASE ACTIVITY POT SMOKERS ON' CN ALIKE THIS ESPECIALLY MALE POT SMOKERS ARE CIN LIKE THIS BUT IT'S THE REALITY REMEMBER WHAT YOU HERN'G IN THE BACKGROUND IS COSTELLO SNORING REALLY LOUD SHO WE PUT HIM ON SCREEN HE HE'S NOT A CANIBAS SMOKER BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE WHY HERE THIS DOG DEFINLY DOES NOT NEED A CANABAS THIS IS HIS STATE FOR MOST THE TIME HE IS HIGHLY ES ASLEEP STILL SO SOME OF YOU OVE ASKED TO S COSTELLOTH YOU JUST LISTENING ON AUDIOMABEHE WATHAT'S A E RE LSHE'S ALWAYS HERE SOME YOUVE ASKED TO SEE HIM A COSTELLO'S NOT APOT SMOKER EITHER A HO DID HAVE A DOG SIDER THAT A WAS A WAS A POT SMOKER YEARS AGO IS IT WAS HIS FAVORITE DOG SIDER BUT A I'M NOT APOT SMOKER AGAN NO JUDGMENT BUT HERE'S THE HERE'S THE DEAL THAT CANABAS AND IT'S NOT CLEAR IF ITS T H C ITSELF OR OTHER ELEMENTS IN THE MAROWANA PLANT PROMOTE A ROMATASE ACTIVITY NOW THIS HAS BEEN OBSERVED ANECDOTALLY WHERE POT SMOKERS HAVE A HIGHER INCIDENTS OF DEVELOPING SOMETHING I MENTION BEFORE GONICAMASTIA BREASTBUD DEVELOPMENT OR FULL BLOWN BREST DEVELOPMENT IN MALES THERE MAY BE SOME WOMEN WHO WANT IT INCREASE THERE A ESTROGENNIC ACTIVITY REMEMBER FEMALES MAKE TESTOSTRONE IT COMES FROM THE ADRINALS MIGT THEY DON'T HAVE TESTES SO IT COMES FROM THE ADRINALS AND NOT TESTOSTRONE CAN ALSO BE A ROMATIZED ALTHOUGH TYPICALLY MOST OF MOST OF THE AROMATASE ACTVITY THAT REFERRING TO IN THESE EXAMPLES IS IN MALES SO TESTOSTRONE CAN INCREASE ESTROGENIC ACTIVITY SOUM MI SAY OH YOU KNOW THEREFORE DOES TESTOSTRONE REDUCE A YOU KNO SECTUAL BEHAVIOR DOES IT A CREATE ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT ARE RELATED TO AM YOU LO TESTOSRONE NOT NECESSARILY NOT NECESSARILY AND HEARE'S WHY ESTROGEN ITSELF IN MALES ANFEMALES IS IMPORTANT FOR THINGS LIKE LIBIDO AND AND AND SECUAL BEHAVIOR GOMEN A REPEAT THAT IF ESTROGEN IS TOO LOW IN MALES IT CONNACTUALLY INHIBOT LIBIDO AND SECUAL BEHAVIOR SO YOU DON'T WANT ESTROGEN TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW WHETHER NOT YOUR MALE OR FEMALE NOW OF COURSE IN FEMALES ESTROGEN LEVELS TEN TOBE HIGHER THAN IN MALES A'M SPEAKING VERY GENERALLY HERE YOU THINK BACK TO THE CHROMASOMAL SECTS THAT'S WHAT I'M REFERRING TO AN ISAY MALE OR FEMALE THOUGH THERE'S NUANTS THERE OF COURSE IN FEMALES THE TESTOSTERONE THAT COMES FROM THE ADREMALES HAS A POWERFUL EFFECT ON LIBEDO AND DESIRE TO REPRODUCE AND IN THE NEXT EPISODE WEREGAN A TALK ABOUT HOW THAT WORKS IN ITS RELATIONSHIP TO BIRTH CONTROL ITS RELATIONSHIP TO MENAPOS WERELSEWE CAN TALK ABOUT HOW THAT WHOLE THING WORKS IN MALES AS WELL BUT CANABUS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE MARIWANA PLANT CAN IMPACT LEVELS OF TESTOSTERAND ESTROGEN BY INCREASING A ROMATISE AND SO O PEOPLE SHOULD BE AWARE OF THAT AS WELL THERE ARE GOOD DATA WAS ABLE TO FIND SEVERAL STUDIES ON PUBBED POINTING THE FACT THAT SMOKING MARIWANA DURING PREGNANCY CAN SHIFT THE PATTERN OF HORMONES IN THE EVELOPING PEDUS SUCH THAT IT PROMOTES MORE ESTROGENIC OUTCOMES NOW EARLIER I SAID THAT ESTROGEN IS WHAT MASCULINIZES THE MALE BRAIN IN UTERO THAT'S TRUE BUT THE WAY THAT CANABUSTS SEEMS TO WORK AT LEAST FROM THE STUDIES I WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY IS THAT IT PROMOTES CIRCULATING ESTROGEN IN THE BODY AND THEREFORE CAN COUNTERACT SOME OF THE MASCULINIZING EFFECTS OF A THINGS LIKE TESTSTERONE AND DIHYDROTESTOSTERON ON PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SECUAL CHARACTERISTICS SO I MENTION THIS BECAUSE ON YOU DO I THINK NOWADAYS A MARIWANIUS IS FAR MORE WIDESPREAD AND CERTAINLY DURING PUBERTY ITS IT CAN HAVE PROFOUND EFFACTS ON THESE HORMONAL SYSTEMS AND SO WILL DO ANOTHER EPISODE THAT GOES REALLY DEEP INTO THIS BUT YES CANABUS PROMOTES ESTROGENIC ACTIVITY BY INCREASING A ROMATICE MOST EVERYONE CAN APPRECIATE THAT DRINKING DURING PREGNANCY IS NOT GOOD FOR THE DEVELOPING PHEDIS PEDALACOHOL CYNDRUM IS A WELL ESTABLISHED A NEGATIVE OUTCOME OF PREGNANCY AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THER COGNATIVE EFFECTS THAT ARE THAT ARE REALLY BAD THERE THERE'S ECTUALLY PHYSICAL MALFORMATION A ET CETERA SO DRINKING DURING PREGNANCY NOT GOOD PROBABLY DRINKING DURING PUBERTY NOT GOOD EITHER BECAUSE ALCOHOL IN PARTICULAR CERTAIN THINGS LIKE BEER BUT OTHER GRAIN ALCOHOLS CAN INCREASE ESTROGENIC ACTIVITY NOW THIS IS 'N JUST ABOUT PROTECTING YOUNG BOYS FROM ESTROGENIC ACTIVITY IT'S ALSO PROTECTING GIRLS FROM FROM EXCESSIVE OR EVEN HYPO ESTROGENIC EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL IN PUBERTY NOW MANY TEAN AGERS DRINK COLLEGE STUDENTS DRINK AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT PUBERTY DOESN'T START ON ONE DAY AND END ON ANOTHER DAY PUBERTY HAS A BEGINNING A MIDDLE AND AN END BUT DEVELOPMENT IS REALLY OURE ENTIRE LIFE SPAN THIS IDEA THAT YOU KNOW PUBERTY IA UNO HAS AS OPEN INCLOSE THAT'S JUST FALSE OCASE SO WE TALKED ABOUT CANIBUS WE TALKED ABOUT ALCOHOL LETS TALK ABOUT SELPHONES FIRST OF ALL I USE A SELPHONE I USE IT VERY OFTEN AND I DO NOT THINK THEY ARE EVIL DEVICES I THINK THAT THEY REQUIRE SOME DISCIPLINE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOES NOT BECOME A NEGATIVE FORCE IN ONE'S LIFE SO I PERSONALLY RESTRICT THE NUMBER OF HOURS THAT AMON THE PHONE AND IN PARTICULAR ON SOCIA MEDIA I ONLY ANSWER YOU MELT PARTICULAR TIMES OF DAY BUT WHAT ABOUT THE SELPHONE ITSELF NOW WHEN I WAS A JUNIOR PROFESSOR IS ARE PRETENOR EARLY PROFESSOR I TAUGHT THIS CLASS ON NERL CIRCUITS AND HELTHAN DISEASE AND ONE OF THE STUDENTS ASKED ME ARE SELPHONE SAFE FOR THE BRAIN AND YOU KNOW THAT ALL THE DATA POINT TO THE FACT THAT THEY WERE OR AT LEAST THERE WERE NO DATA SHOWING THAT IT WASN'T I STILL DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER ON THAT FRANKLY I DON'T SEE A LOT OF STUDIES ABOUT IT I'M NOT PERSONALLY AWARE OF ANY EVIDENCE IN QUALITY PURE REVIEWED STUDIES SHOWING THAT SELPHONES ARE BAT FOR THE BRAIN OR THAT HOLDING THE PHONE TO THE EAR IS BAD OR THAT BLUE TOOTH IS BAD OR ANY OF THAT I'M JUST NOT AWARE OF ANY QUALITY STUDIES IF YOU ARE AWARE OF QUALITY STUDIES PURE REVIEWED STUDY PLEASE REFERENCE THEM PUT THEM IN THE COMMENT SECTION SEND THEM TO ME HARVERYOULIKE I'D LOVE TO SEE THEM I'M NOT AWARE OF THEM HOWEVER I WAS VERY INTERESTED IN A PARTICULAR STUDY THAT WAS STUT THAT WAS PUBLISHED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN ON RATS IT WAS BASELY TOOK A SELPHONE AND PUT IT UNDER CAGEA RATS AND LOOKED AT BASICALLY TESTICULAR AND OVARIAN DEVELOPMENT AND RATS AND SAW MINOR BUT BUT STILL STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DEFECTS IN OVARIAN IN TESTICULAR DEVELOPMENT SINCE THEN AND NOW RETURNING TO THE LITERATURE I'VE SEEN A ABSOLUTE EXPLOSION OF STUDIES SOME OF WHICH ARE IN QUALITY JOURNALS SOME OF WHICH ARE IN WHAT I WOILL CALL NOT A BLUE RIBBON JOURNALS IDENTIPHYING DEFECTS IN TESTICULAR END OR OVARIAN DEVELOPMENT BY MERE EXPOSURE TO SELPHONE ADADMITTED WAVES LEST JUST CALL THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE AND THIS SOUNDS ALMOST CRAZY RIGHT ANY TIME SOMEBODY CERCHUYING BY E M HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU HAD A WORRY LIKE THIS PERSONAKE BUT LOOK THE LITERATURE POINTING IN A DIRECTION WHERE CHRONIC EXPOSURE OF THE OF THE GONADS TO SELPHONES COULD BE CREATING SERIOUS ISSUES IN TERMS OF THE HEALTH AT THE SELLAR LEVEL AND AN TERMS OF THE OUTPUT SO THE OUTPUT IN FOR THE TESTES WOULD BE SPERM PRODUCTION I'M SWIMMING SPEED AND SPERM IT IS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF SPIRM HEALTH IN THE OVERIES IT WOULD BE ESTROGENIC OUTPUT ON HOW HOW REGULAR THE CYCLES ARE SO AN ANIMALS THE CYCLES ARE LOE AT DIFFERENT OM THAN IN INHUMANS THEY DON'T HAVE A MENSTRAL CYCLE THEY HAVE AN ESTRA CYCLE WHICH IS A GENERALLY ROUND FOUR DAYS I THINK THAT IT'S FAIR TO SAY BASED ON THE LITERATURE THAT THERE ARE EFFACTS OF SELPHONE ADMITTED WAVES ON GONATAL DEVELOPMENT THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE PROXIMITY OF THE SELPHONE TO THE GONATS NOW I'VE TAKEN THE THE LITERATURE AS I OBSERVE IT AND THAT OF COURSE WILL POINT YOU TO IN THE CAPTIONS AND I I DON'T LIKE TO HAVE MYSELPHONE ON AND IN MY POCKET A I'M WELL PASPUBRITY BUT NON THE LAST SOME OF TESE EFFECTS WERE SEEN AN ADULT ANIMALS THERE ARE EFFECTS NOW THAT HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN HUMAN SO LET'S YOUST TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF THOSE EFFECTS SO PAPER PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL CLINICAL BYLE CHEMISTRY FROM ESCANDER AT ALL LOOKED AT HORMONE PROPILES AN PEOPLE BASED ON PROXIMITY AND FREE PROXIMITY TO THEIR PHONE AND FREQUENCY OF PHONE USE WHERE THEY STORED THEIR PHON ON THEIR BODY AS WELL AS PROXIMITY OF WHERE THEY LIVED TO I GUESS THEY THER CALLED THESE RADIO FREQUENCY TOWERS TO THE BASE STATIONS AND THEY WERE LOOKING AT EFFECTS OF RADIO FREQUENCY A RADIATION ARE FAR ON HUMAN HORMONE PROFILES AND THEY SHOW SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN CORTIS ALL YOU MIGHT SAY WITE THAT MIGHT BE GOOD BUT YOU NEED THAT MORNING CORTISAL BUMP A IN ORDER TO WAKE UP MORNING CUORTERS ALL IS GOOD BUT ALSO FHIROYD HARMONES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE PROLACTING IN YOUNG FEMALES THAT'S DEPHONLY CONCERNING AND TESTOSTERONE LEVELS IN MALES AND FEMALES AND SO THERE ARE NOW QUITE GOOD DATA SHOWING THAT BEING CLOSE TO THE PHONE TOO MUCH OF THE DAY A AND HOW CLOSE IT IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION OR NLIVING NEAR ONE OF THESE BASE STATIONS A APPARENTLY CAN HAVE AF FACTS ON HORMONE PROFILES AND WHEN YOU SEE A STUDY LIKE THIS ONE SHOULD ALWAYS ASK WELL WHAT ARE THE OTHER THINGS THAT COULD ALSO HAVE EFFECTS ON THESE HORMONE PROFILES RIGHT CAUSE YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT A IF YOU RAN THE SAME STUDY OF PEOPLE THAT LIVE CLOSE TO A WATERWAY OR CLOSE TO A HIGHWAY WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF A EXHAST FROM BUSSES AND AND CARS YOU MIGHT SEE SIMILAR EFFECTS SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE THESE SORTS OF STUDIES WITH A GRAIN OFSAULT BUTI THINK IT'S VERY INTERESTING AND GIVEN THAT THE LAST TIME I LOOKED INTO THESE DATA WERE WAY BACK WHEN I WAS A JUNIOR PROFESSOR AND THERE WAS LIKE ONE OR TWO STUDIES THAT I COULD FIND ONE OF THE STUDIES POINTED TO A INCREASES IN TESTOSTERONE AND RATS WHERE THEY WER HAD CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THESE UM A RADIO FREQUENCY A RADIATION WAVES AND THEN IN THE OTHER CASE IT SHOWE DECREASES IN TESTOSTRONE IT'S SO THERE REALLY WASN'T ANY CONCLUSION TAKE AWAY FROM THAT NOW THERE'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE A AMOUNT OF DATA POINTING TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE EFFECTS OF THESE THINGS ON HORMONES I WO NOWHAT TO DO WITH THAT INFORMATION I'M NOT GOIN A STOP USING MY PHONE BUT IN THE LIGHT OF THE WORK FROM TIERONE HAZE AND OTHERS LOOKING AT A AT SPERM COUNTS AND LOOKING AT A THE THE DECREASE IN TESTOSTRONE LEVELS IN SPERM COUNTS AND A FERTILITY OVER THE LAST TWENTY THIRTY YEARS PERHAPS IT'S A YOU KNOW NOT SURPRISING ALTHOUGH THERE AGAIND SELPHONES AND SMARPHONES HAVE REALLY BEEN IN PROMINENT USE MOSTLY WITHIN THE LAST TEN OR ELEVEN YEARS AND SO IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN ALL OF THOSE DCLINES SIMPLY ON THE BASIS OF OF SELPHONE USE THERE'S SOME INTERESTING EFFECTS OF HORMONES THAT ASH CAN OBSERVE ON THE OUTIDE OF PEOPLE THAT TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT NOT JUST THEIR LEVEL OF FORMONES BUT ALSO ABOUT THEIR UNDERLYING GENATICS AND THESE RELATE TO BEARD GROWTH AND BALDNESS AND ITS FASCINATING THE MOLECULE THE HORMONE DIHYDROTESTOSTRONE MADE FROM TOSTOSTRONE IS THE HORMON PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR FACIAL HAIR FOR BEARD GROWTH AS WELL ITS THE MOLECULE THE HORMONE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR LACK OF HAIR ON THE HEAD FOR HAIR LOSS HOW DOES THAT WORK WELL D H T CIRCULATES IN THE BODY AND IT BINDS TO D H T RECEPTORS IN THE FACE TO PROMOTE HAIR GROWTH BUT IT BINDS TO D H T RECEPTORS ON THE SCALP TO PROMOTE HAIR LOSS NOT INCIDENTALLY THE DRUGS THAT ARE DESIGN TO PREVENT HAIR LOSS ARE FIVE ALPHOR REDUCTASE INHIBITERS SO REMEMBER FIVE ALFOR DUCTASTES FROM THE UEVEDOSIS WELL THE PEOPLE THAT DISCOVERED THE WEVEDOSIS WENT ON TO DO A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THE UNDERLYING BILE CHEMISTRY OF THIS REALLY INTERESTING MOLECULE DAHYDRO TO STOSTRON THE IDENTIFIED FIVE ALFOR DUCTASE AND FIVE ALPHOD REDUCTATES INHIBITERS ARE THE BASIS OF MOST OF THE ANTI HAIR LOST TREATMENTS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND SO THERE'S SOME INTERESTING THINGS HERE FIRST OF ALL THE SIDIFECT PROFILES OF THOSE TREATMENTS FOR HAIR LOSS ARE QUITE SEVERE IN MANY INDIVIDUALS REMEMBER D H T IS THE PRIMARY ANDROGEN FOR LEBIDO FOR STRENGTH AND CONNECTIVE TISSUE ON A REPAIR FOR A AGGRESSION EVEN IF THAT AGGRESSION OF COURSEIS HELD IN CHECK BUT JUST SORT OF AMBITION AND AGGRESSION IS RELATED DOPOMEN BUT WITHIN THE TESTASTRONE PATHWAY LESS SO TO PURE TESTOSTRONE ALTHOUGH PURE TESTOSTRON HAS ITS EFFECTS BUT D H T IS AT LEAST IN PRIMA SPECIES INCLUDING HUMANS IS THE DOMINANT ANDROGEN FOR MOST OF THOSE SORTS OF EFFECTS AND IF YOU LOOK AT SOMEBODY EVRON CAN PREDICT WHETHER OR NOT THEI'R GING TO GO BALD BASED ON LOOKING AT THERE WE AREALWAYS TAUGHT AUR MOTHER'S FATHER SO IF YOUR MOTHER'S FATHER WAS BALD THERE'S A HIGHER PROBABILITY THAT YOU'RE GIN TO GO BALD THE PATTERN OF D H T RECEPTORS ON THE SCALP WILL DICTATE WHETHER NOT YOU'RE GING TO GO BALD EVERYWHERE OR JUST IN THE FRONTORSOO CROWNTYPE BALDNESS AND THE DENSITY OF THE BEARD TELLS YOU BY THE DENSITY OF D H T RECEPTORS NOW THIS VERIES BY BY BACKGROUND BY GENATIC BACKGROUND AND ACTUALLY AROUND THE WORLD NOWADAYS BECAUSE PEOPLE TRAVEL AND PEOPLE A FORM COUPLES AND HAVE OF KIDS WITH A SO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT MIXED CULTURES YOU'RE SEEN THIS STARTING TO DISAPPEAR BUT THERE ARE ERS AREAS OF THE WORLD WHERE ALL THE MEN SEEM TO BE HAVE THE SAME PATTERN OF BALDNESS LIKE A STRIP OF BALDNESS DOWN THE CENTERE WITH HAIR STILL ON THE SIDES AND AND FULL BEARDS THAT'S BECAUSE THESE PATTERNS OF D H T RECEPTORS ARE GENETICALLY DETERMINED ELSEWHERE TESTOSTRON LEVELS CAN STILL BE VERY HIGH D H T LEVELS IN THE BLOOD CAN BE VERY HIGH AND YET PEOPLE WILL HAVE VERY LIGHT BEARDS OR NO BEARDS AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE LOT OF D H T RECEPTORS IN THE FACE AND STILL OTHER CULTURES YOU'LL SEE PEOPLE WITH WITH HUGE BEARD TONS OF BERGO LIKE THEIR BEARDS A E GROWIN ALL THE WAY UP TO THEIR EYES AND THEY HAVE HUGE HEADS OF HAIR AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY 'VE LOD  H  RECEPTORS ON THE FACE AND NOT AND NOT ON THE SCALP SO THE'RE A LOT OF A AFFECTS OF D H T THAT YOU CAN JUST SEE IN MALE FINA TYPES AND IT'S INTERESTING THAT THESE HAIRLOSS DRUGS THAT ARE A OR TO PREVENT HAIRLOSS DRUGS ARE DIRECTLY AIMED AT PREVENTING THE CONVERSION OF TESTOSTRONE INTO DIHYDRO TESTOSTRONE AND THAT'SWHY THEY TO SOME EXTENT PREVENT HAIRLOS BUT ALSO TO SOME EXTENT HAVE A BUNCH OF SIDAFFECTS EIR ASSOCIATE WITH LOD H T ALONG THESE LINES THERE'S A PARTICULAR A SPORT SUPPLEMENT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE USE CALLED CREATINE CREATINE NOW THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH SHOWING THAT CREATINE CAN BRING MORE A MORE WATER INTO THE MUSCLE IT CAN' SUPPORT STRENGTH AM IT DOES NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS MIGHT EVEN HAVE SOME IMPORTANT COGNITIVE PROMOTING A COGNUMAN HANSMAN EFFECTS ALTHOUGH MILD A THE STUDIES THEIR SHOW THAT IT CAN BE SIGNIFICANT A SOME PEOPLE NOT ALL IT'S MORE ANECDOTAL REPORT THAT CREATINE PROMOTES HAIRLOSS IT DIFFERS BY INDIVIDUAL FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT'S TRUE FOR OTHERS NO BUT YES IT DOES APPEAR BASED ON THE STUDIES I WAS ABLE TO FIND ON PUMED THAT CREATINE DOES PROMOTE FIVE OLT FOR EDOCTS ACTIVITY AND THEREFORE THE CONVERSION OF TESTOSTRONE INTO DIHYDR TESTOSTRONE AND SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT IT MIGHT PROMOTE SOME DEGREE OF HAIR LOSS AS WELL AS BEARD GROWTH AS WELL AS THE OTHER EFFECTS OF D H T I RECALL IN JUNIOR A HIGH SCHOOL IN MIDDLE SCHOOL GOING HOME ONE SUMMER SEVENTH GREAT COMING BACK THE EIGH GRATE AND A KID THAT I KNEW THAT I WAS FRIENDS WITH WHEN FROM BEING LIKE A YOUNG KID TO IS LIKE A GROWN MEN HE HAD A FULL BEARD IT WAS AMAZING WHO WAS LIKELA COMPLETELY TRANSFORMING PUBERITY AS I'VE SAID BEFORE IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE MOST EXCELERATED RATE OF DEVELOPMENT THAT WE WILL GO THROUGH AT ANY POINT IN OUR LIVES EVEN FASTER THAN INFANCY JUSTIN TERMS OF THE HUGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COGNIVE CHANGES AND PHYSICAL CHANGES NOT SURPRISINGLY THAT SAME INDIVIDUAL WAS MOSTLY OR BAULD BY HIS EARLY TWENTIES AND THAT'S BECAUSE HE MUST HAVE HAD JUST EXCEEDINGLY HIGH LEVELS OF D H T ALSO PLATE STOCKER WITH THIS KID AND HE WAS BASELY LIKE DRIBBLING PAST EVERYBODY WAS LIKE A GROWN MAN PLAING STOCKER WITH A BUNCHOF OLD KIDS FULL BEARD HE BALL THAT TWENTY AND SO THE RATE OF MACURATION THE RATE OF AGING IS VERY INTERESTING ITS HARD TO KNOW RATE OF AGING THEIR SOME GENETIC TESTS THAT NOW CAN ALLOW YOU TO DO THAT THINGS LIKE HORVATH CLOCKS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT BEAUTIFUL WORK OF DAVIDSON CLAR AT HARVARD AND OTHERS IS POINTED TO THIS THE SPEED OF ENTRY AND EXIT FROM PUBERTY MIGHT BE PONNY OUT THERE AS THE HYPOTHESIS MIGHT BE AN INTERESTING WINDOW INTO HOW FAST ONE IS GOING THROUGH THEIR AGING OR DEVELOPMENTAL ARK BECAUSE DEVELOPMENT OF COURSE DOESN'T JUST START AT BIRTH AND AND AFTER PUBERTY IT CONTINUES YOUR ENTIRE LIFE SO I THINK IT'S INTERESTING I YOU WILL OFTEN SEE THAT PEOPLE BOYS AND GIRLS I SHOUS A BOYS OR GIRLS WILL DEVELOP SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS AT DIFFERENT RATES AND SOMETIMES IT  SEQUENTIAL EN YOU MIGHT SEE A KID WILL A SHALL GROW VERY TALL OR SHALL HAVE A BIG GROTSPERT BUT THEN BREAST DEVELOPMENT WILL COME A LOBIT LATER AND THEN OTHER FEATURES WILL COME ALIBIT LATER YO YOU CAN ALSO SEE THIS IN BOYS THE PERSON THAT I REFERRED TO EARLIER MY FRIEND THAT DEVELOP FULL BEARD YOU KNOW WENT BALD I WAS ALSO QUITE MUSCULARIES A GREAT ATHLE SO HE WENT THROUGH PUBRITY EXCEEDINGLY FAST OTHER PEOPLE GO THROUGH IT MORE SLOWLY SOME PEOPLE WILL GO THROUGH PUBERTY AT AGE FOURTEEN BUT THEY WON'T START TO ACCUMULATE FACIAL HAIR UNTIL MUCH MUCH LATER OR THEIR VOICE WILL CHANGE FIRST VERY EARLY AND THEN THEY WON'T GET THE OTHER SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS UNTIL MUCH LATER AND SO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW THAT IMPACTS OR RELATES TO OVERALL TRAJECTORY OR RATE OF AGING BUT'S INTERESTING THING TO THINK ABOUT PREECH IN EVERY ONE OF US I' M ANTO OFFER YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO IN EXPERIMENT TO DAY WHILE LISTENING TO THE PODCAS BUT FIRST I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT HYENAS PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL AND CLITERUSIS THE SIZE OF PENISIS SO WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT AT YOU SEE BERKLEY WE HAD A PROFESSOR IN OUR DEPARTMENT PHENOMENAL SCIENTIST A STEVE GLICHMAN STEVE GLICHMAN HAD A COLONY OF HYENAS SPOTTED HYENAS THAT LIVED WITHIN CAGED ENCLOSURES OF COURSE IN TILDEN PARK BEHIND THE USEE BERKLY CAMPUS THE ENCLOSURES ARE ACTUALLY STILL THERE I RUN PAST THERE FAIRLY OFTEN THE HYENAS ARE NO LONGER THERE THIS WAS A FEDERALLY FUNDED FIELD STATION THESE ANIMALS WERE BROUGHT OVER FROM AFRICA OR WERE BRED THERE AND THE REASON WHY THERE WERE HYENAS UNTIL TIN PARK INCLOSED IN TILLD INPARK WAS BECAUSE HYENAS EXHIBIT AND INCREDIBLE FEATURE TO THEIR BODY THEIR HORMONES AND THEIR SOCIAL STRUCTURE HYENAS UNLIKE MANY SPECIES HAVE A SITUATION WITH THEIR GENATALIA WHERE THE MALE PENUS IS ACTUALLY SMALLER THEN THE FEMALE CLITERUS AND I SHOULD SAY THAT THE MAL PENUS ITSELF HAVING SEEN A FAIR NUMBER OF HYENOPENASIS IS NOT PARTICULARLY SMALL WHICH MEANS THAT THE HYENA CLITERUSES ARE EXTREMELY LARGE THIS WAS WELL KNOWN FOR SOME TIME IT TURNS OUT THAT IN THE SPOTTED HYENAS THE FEMALES ARE DOMINANT SO AFTER A KILL THE FEMALES WILL EAT THEN THEIR YOUNG WILL EAT AND THEND THE MALE HYENAS WILL EAT AS WELL WHEN THE FEMALE HYENA GIVES BIRTH SHE GIVES BIRTH NOT THROUGH THE VAGENAL CANAL THAT WERE ACCUSTOM TO SEEING BUT THROUGH VERY ENLARGE CLITERUS LIKE FALAS ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT A FALIS IT'S ECLITERUS AND IT LITERALLY SPLITS OPEN SO THE MANY PHETUS'S DI DURING THE COURSE OF HYENA DEVELOPMENT AND BIRTH THESE ANIMALS HAVE THIS WHAT IS COULD ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A VERY LARGE OR GIANT CLITERES ALTHOUGH FOR A HYENA IT'S NOT GYANT ITS NORMAL AND IT SPLITS OPEN AND THE BABY ACTUALLY COMES THROUGH THE BABY HYENE ACTIOL COMES THROUGH THE THE TISSUE AND ITS ITS A VERY TROMATIC BIRTH A LOT OF TISSUE IS TORN AWAY ET CETERA AND AS I MENTION A LOT OF BABY HYNAIS DIE IT WAS A MYSTERY AS TO HOW THE THE FEMALE HYENAS HAVE THIS WILL CALL IT MASCULINIZATION BUT IT'S REALLY A ANDRIGES GE EXCUSE ME ANDROGENIZATION OF THE PARIPHERY OF THE GENATALIA AND IT TURNS OUT THROUGH A LOT OF CAREFUL RESEARCH DONE BY DEGLICMAN CHRISTINE DRAY A AND AND OTHERS THAT ITS ANDRISTINE DIONE WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A PROHORM ONTOTESTOSTRONE IT'S ANDRESTINE DIONE AT VERY HIGH LEVELS THAT'S PRODUCED INFEMALE HYENAS THAT CREATES THIS ENLARGEMENT OF THEIR GENATALIA SO IF YOU WANT TO READ UP ON ENTERSINE DIONE ANDRESTINE DIONE IS MADE INTO TESTOSTRONE THROUGH THIS ENZIME SEVENTEENE BADA HYDRO HYDROXY STEROID DEHYDRO DROHOGENAS IT'S A COMPLICATED PATHWAY TIS TO PRONOUNCE IS A FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD PATHWAY BY OCHEMICALLY YOU MAY RECALL DURING THE NINDIES AND TWO THOUSANDS THERE WERE A LOT OF A PERFORMANCE IN HANCING DRUG SCANDALS IN PARTICULAR IN MAJORLY BASEBALL AND IT WAS PURPORTED ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW THAT IT WAS EVER VERIFIED BUT IT WAS PROPORTED THAT THE MAJOR AM PERFORMANCE IN HANCING DRUG OF ABUSE AT THAT TIME IN PARTICULAR PLAYERS WHOSE NAMES WE WON'T MENTION BUT YOU CAN GUGLIT IF IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT WAS ANDRISTINE DIONE AND ACTUALLY RECALL LONG AGO WHEN YOU COULD BY ANDROSTINE DIONE IN THE HEALTH FOOD STORS AND SO IT WAS SOLD OVER THE COUNTER SO A LOTS CHANGE SINCE THEN AM BUT IT'S INTERESTING THAT THESE HYENAS WITH THESE HIGHLY ANDRIGENIZED GENATALIA ACCOMPLISH THAT THROUGH HIGH LEVELS OF ANDROSTENE DYON IN THE FEMALES NOW IF THATS UNUSUAL WHAT MIGHT BE EVEN MORE UNUSUALIS AN IS THAT A GRADUATE STUDENT THAT I WAS WORKING WITH AT THE TIME ALONGSIDE WE DIDN'T A SHARE RESEARCH HER NAME WAS A NICOLA ASIPKA SHE AS ESHALY A TRAINED BEHAVIORAL ANIMAL BEHAVIORAL EXPERT SHE HAD TRAINED FERRETS FOR THAT SHOW THE BEASTSMASTER AND SHOT TRAIN WOLVES FOR TELIVISON SHOWS AND WAS THE DOG TRAINER SHOT THESE TWO LARGE DOGS THAT UNLIKE MY DOG WOULD ACTUALLY LISTEN TO HER WHEN SHE WOULD GIVE THEM COMMANDS A A REMARKABLE SCIENTIST SHE WAS STUDYING A SPECIES OF MOLE THAT ALSO LIVED IN TILL THIN PART PEOPLE SART TA WONDER OF HUNTILDAN PART WHATS IN TILDEN PART BUT THIS PARTICULAR MOLE THAT LIVED THERE HAD TESTES FOR PART OF THE YEAR AND HAD THE CAPACITY TO TRANSDIFFERENTIATE ITS TESTES INTO OVERIES IN ORDER TO BALANCE OUT THE RATIO OF MALES IN FEMALES IN THE POPULATION TO KEEP REPRODUCTION AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS FOR THAT CERTAIN POPULATION SO SOME ANIMALS ARE ACTUALLY ABE ABLE TO ADJUST WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE ANDROGENIZED OR ESTROGENIZED GONADS IN ORDER TO ADJST THE RATIOS OF OFFSPRING OR THE MALES AND FEMALES AN THEREFOR PROMOTE OFFSPRING AND THE LAST LITTLE ANECTOTE ABOUT THIS WHICH IS ALSO PUBLISHED IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE WHICH IS WEIRD BUT I DO FIND INTERESTING HARMONS ARE SO FASCINATING THEIR IS INCREDIBLE TO ME IS GOING BACK TO THE MARAWANA PLANT YO THE MARIWANA PLANT HAS THESE ESTROGENIC PROPERTIES AND I ASKED A PLANT BIOLOGIST WHETHER NOT THIS WAS UNUSUAL AND I ASKED BECAUSE THEREIS ALL THAT THI STUFF OUT THERE ABOUT O YOU NOW SOY DOES THIS AND THESE PLANTS ARE YOU NOHIGHLY ESTROGEN ESTROGENIC ET CETERA ALTHUGH WE SHOULD LLIY POINT OUT THAT A LOT OF FACTORY MEATS ARE ALSO ESTROGENIC SO THIS ISN'T A MEAT VERSES PLANTS THING BUT THIS PLANBILE JUST TOLD ME O YA THERE ARE PLANTS THAT MAKE WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY THE EQUIVALENT OF TESTOSTERONE LIKE PINE POLLENAS LOOKS A LOT LIKE TESTOSTRON AND THERE ARE OTHER PLANTS THAT MAKE WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY ESTROGEN ANSO WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT WIRL THIYS AND Y PLANTS AT LEAST AS FAR AS I KNOW DON'T HAVE A CONSCIOUSNESS THEY DON'T HAVE A BRAIN THAY DON'T HAVE NURONS EVEN BUT HIS ANSWER WAS FASCINATING HE SAID THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY SOME PLANTS HAVE EVOLVED THIS CAPACITY TO INCREASE ESTROGEN LEVELS IN ANIMALS THAT SMNOT SMOKE IT BUT THEN ANIMALS THAT CONSUME THEM I'MGUESSING THAT ANIMALS AREN'T SMOKING MARAWAN ALTHOUGH NAL SEND ME THE PAPER IF YOU'VE HEARD OF THIS IS THAT PLANTS HAVE FIGURED OUT WAYS THEY'VE ADAPTED WAYS TO PUSHBACK ON POPULATIONS OF RODENTS AND OTHER SPECIES OF ANIMALS THAT EAT THEM SO PLANTS ARE ENGAGE IN A KIND OF PLANT TO ANIMAL WARFARE WHERE THEY INCREASED THE ESTROGEN OF HE MALES IN THAT POPULATION TO LOWER THE SPERM COUNTS TO KEEP THOSE POPULATIONS CLAMPED AT CERTAIN LEVELS SO THAT THOSE PLANTS CAN CONTINUE TO FLOURISH EVEN IF THOSE ANIMOLS ARE REPRODUCING VERY ROBOSLY AND I FIND THIS JUST FASCINATING AND HORMONES THEREFORE ARNCHUST IMPACTING TISSUE GROWTH AN DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE INDIVIDUAL AND BETWEEN THE MOTHER REMEMBER THE PLACENTAS AN ENDERCRON ORGAN AND THE OFFSPRING BUT PLANTS IN ANIMALS ARE IN THIS COMMUNICATION AND TO DAY WERE IN THIS COMMUNICATION I'M TELLING YOU THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN URBICIDES THAT HUMANS ARE USING FOR WHICH THERE'S VERY GOOD DATA ARE DISERRUPTING THE ENDERCRAN PATHWAYS AND SO ITS FASCINATING THAT HUMANS AND OTHER ANIMALS WERE ALWAYS IN THIS INTERPLAY WITH PLANTS AND THE OTHER THINGS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND HORMONES AND ADJUSTING THE HORMONE LEVELS OF ANIMALS AND PLANTSES ONE WAY IN WHICH THE ENVIRONMENT KOND OF PUSHES BACK OR PUSHES FORWARD IF YOU WILL IN TERMS OF PROMOTING THERE WELL BEING AND LONCHEVITY AS WELL AS YOU TRYIN TO PROMOTE YOURE WELL BEING AND LONCHEVITY IF ANYONE WANTS TO SEE THE INCREDIBLE PAPER BY STEVE GLICHMAN AND COLLEAGUES IT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE PROSINGS H NATIONAL ACADEMY FIRST IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THAT'S GLICKMEN AT ALL THAT WAS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT IT WAS ENDERSTING DION AND THEN IF YOU JUST GUGO GLICKMAN HYENAS SCIENCE MAGAZINE THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL A COVERARTICL AND FEATURE ALL ABOUT THAT IMPORTANT DISCOVERY IS A FASCINATING ONE AND I SHOULD MENTION ALSO THAT THOSE DISCOVERIES BUTH THE MOLES AND THE HYENAS WEREN' CHUST A IMPACTFUL FOR THE WORLD OF ANIMAL BEHAVOR IN ENTERCHRONOLOGY THEY'VE ALSO STRONGLY IMPACTED UNDERSTANDING OF CONDITIONS THAT SHOW UP IN THE CLINIC WHICH WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT TO DAY WHICH IS ASHISEUDO HERMAPHRDADISM OCCASIONALLY BABIES WILL BE BORNE WHERE IT IS UNCLEAR IF THEY ARE BOYS OR GIRLS BASED ON THE GENITALIA AND THIS HAS VERY IMPORTANT ETHICAL AND OTHER ISSUES DO YOU RAISE THEM AS A BOY OR A GIRL IT'S NOT SUPERUNCOMMON FOR THIS TO HAPPEN AND THERE BEEN TERRIBLE CASES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE GONE AGAINST THE CHROMOZOMAL SECTS AND THE PERSON WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THAT WITH THE CHOICE THAT THEIR PRNTS AN MADE FOR THEM THERE WERE ALSO CASES WHERE THEY'VE GONE WITH THE CROMOZOMAL SEX IN THE PERSON WAS VERY HAPPY ABOUT THE OUTCOME THERE BEEN CASES WHERE THEY BEN TREATED WITH HORMONES AND THERE BE CASES WHERE THEY HAVE NOT BEN TREATE WITH HORMONES IT SAY A A COMPLICATED LITERATURE O AND ITS EAT GAS TO BE SORTED OUT ON KOND OF A CASE BY CASE BASIS BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT DOES HAPPEN AND THE STUDIES ON ENTERSTING DION AN HYENAS AND IN THESE A VERY INTERESTING MOLES SUTOHOMAPHRODITIC MOLES THAT LIVE INTILLD IN PARK A HAVE IMPACTED NOT JUST THE SCIENCE BUT THE THEIRE APUTICS AROUND THOSE IMPORTANT ISSUES SO NOW LAST BUT NOT LEAST I WANT TO DISCUSS THE EFFECTS OF HORMONES WHILE YOU AND I WERE SEPARATELY IN UTERO AND THE EFFECTS THAT THAT HAD ON WHO WE ARE WHO WE SELECT AS MATES SO MATE CHOICE SEXUAL PREFERENCE AND ALL OTHER ASPECTS OF WHAT YOU WOULD CALL SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT NOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOT IN A LOT OF POPULAR PRESS AND IT HAS TO DO WITH HOW EXPOSURE TO ANDRGENS IN PARTICULAR WHILE WE WERE IN UTERO IMPACTED WHETHER NOT PEOPLE REPORT AS HOMOSEXUAL HETEROSEXUAL IDENTIFY IS MALE OR FEMALE IM VERY FAMILIAR WITH THIS WORK BECAUSE I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT IN THE DEPARTMENT THAT FIRST PUBLISH THIS WORK AND I'M AN AUTHOR ON THE PAPER I WAS NOT THE MAIN DRIVER OF THE WORK BUT I WAS INVOLVED IN THE WORK AND I CERTAINLY KNOW THE PEOPLE THAT DID THIS WORK FIRST IT STARTS WITH A STORY THERE WAS A RESEARCHER WHOS STILL GOING NOW HIS NAME IS DENIS IN MAKE FATEN I BELIEVE IS IT UTEASTIN BACK THEN AND HE WAS STUDYING THE AUDITORY SYSTEM AND PET WILL COME INTO HIS CLENIC AND HE WOULD A OR ITIS LABORATORY AND HE WOULD LOOK AT HEARING AND HE WOULD EXPLORED DIFFRENT ASPECTS OF WHAT THEY CAL THE PSYCLOPHYSICS OF HEARING AND UNDERSTAING HERING THRESHOLDS AND FREQUENCY THRESHOLDS AND HE MADE SEVERAL OBSERVATIONS AND THOSE OBSERVATIONS WORE THAT YOUNG MALES TENDED TO HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED AUTOACUSTA COMMISSIONS MORE OFTEN THAN YOUNG FEMALES DID AUTOACUSTA COMMISSIONS AS THE NAMES SUGGESTS ARE THE EARS ACTUALLY MAKING SOUNDS NOW THESE SOUNDS HAVE TO BE PICKED UP BY S SPECIAL APPARATUS CAUSE THEY CAN HEAR INTO THAT FREQUENCY BUT TURNS OUT THAT YOUR EARS DON'T JUST TAKE SOUND WAVES AND CONVERT THEM INTO THESE THINGS THAT WE THIS THING WE CALL HEARING BUT THEY ALSO IN SOME GASES MAKE SOUNDS SO YOUR EARS ARE MAKING SOUNDS STRANGE RIGHT SO IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE IS A SEX DIFFERENCE IN AUTOACUSTA COMMISSIONS TURNS OUT ALSO THAT PEOPLE THAT SELF REPORT AS LESBIANS THEY ALSO HAVE AUTOACUSTA COMMISSIONS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN FEMALES THAT DON'T SELF REPORT AS LESBIAN AND DENIS NOTICE THIS AND PUBLISH THIS AND IT WAS AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY BECAUSE IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST DISCOVERIES THAT THERE COULT THAT POINTED TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SEX DIFFERENCES IN BIOLOGY THAT ARE INDEPENDENT OF SEXS I MEAN THIS IS HEARING IN AUTOCUSTA COMMISSIONS AND AT JUST TO REALLY ILLUSTRATE WHAT THAT OF WHAT THE FORMER PROBLEM WAS AND WHY THIS STUDY WAS SO IMPORTANT YE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD EXPLORED FOR INSTANCE WHETHER OR NOT O HOMOSEXUALS HAD LOWER A TESTOSTRONE FOR INSTANCE IN MALES AND ACTUALLY THE RESULT OFTEN WAS THE OPPOSITE THAT AGAY MEN OR MEN THAT SELF REPORT IS GAY OFTEN HAD MUCH HIGHER TESTOSTROM AND THOSE STUDIES THEN BECAME CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE PEOPLE SAID WELL YOU KNOW SEXUAL BEHAVIOR CAN RELATE TO TESTOSTRONE ET CETERA AND SO T BECAME VERY CONTROVERSIAL AND THEN THERE WERE SOME STUDIES THAT ATTEMPTED TO LOOK AT THE EQUILIN A PHENOMENON IN PEOPLE THAT SELF REPORT IS AS LESBIAN OR SELF REPORT AS HETEROSEXUAL AND SO IT BECAME VERY COMPLICATED BUT THIS WAS AN IDENTIFICATION OF A PHENOMENONAUTOCUSTI COMMISSIONS THAT WAS INDEPENDENT OF ANYTHING THAT HAD TO DO WITH SEXUAL OR EVEN SOCIAL BEHAVIOR NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT ROLLS AROUND AND IMA GRADUATE STUDENT YOU SE BERKLY AND I GUY BY THE NAME OF MARK BREED LOVE KIND OF A ANIRONIC NAME GIVEN THAT HE WORKED YE WORKED END STILL WORKS ON SEXUAL DIAMORPHISM IN THE BRAIN AND IN THE FINAL CORTAN NERVOUS SYSTEM AND MARK WHO PHENOMENAL SCIENTIST COMES RUNNING DOWN THE HALL I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS ANS IT GIMME YOUR HANDS SIREXACT GIMM YOUR HANDS AND HE PULLS OUT A RULER AND INSTRUCTS MEASURING MY FINGERS AND HE TAKES DOWN A COUPLE MEASUREMENTS AND THEN HE GOES AWAY NLY WELL WAS THAT WELL I WAS IN A COURSE THAT MARK WAS TEACHING AT THAT POINT AND SOON AFTER WE DID A STUDY THAT MARK DIRECTED EXPLORING THE FINGER LENGTH RATIOS AND ILL EXPLAIN WHAT THOSE ARE OF MALES AND FEMALES AND PEOPLE THAT SELF REPORTED AS HOMOSEXUAL OR HETEROSEXUAL SO LET JUST GET TO THE BASIC WHAT WI'LL CALL SEX DIFFERENCES FIRST THESE ARE AVERAGES I WANT A POINT OUT INTIME YOU GET INTO THIS KIND OF TOPIC PEOPLER YOU KNOW ASSUME ITS CAUSAL BUT IT'S NOT CALLSED OF THESE ARE AVERAGES THAT AM ABOUT TO REPORT IT IS THE CASE THAT THE RATIOE OF WHAT'S CALLED THE D TWO TO D FOR DIDGIT SO THE D TWO IS Y YOUR INDEX FINGERS SO YOUR THUMB IS D ONE THAN D TO WOULD BE YOUR INDEX FINGER THAT YOU WOULD POINT WITH MIDLE FINGER AS D THREE WHICH YOU WHATEVER WITH AND THEN D FOR IS THE SO CALED RING FINGER OCAN DFIVE IS THE PINKIE IT IS THE CASE THAT THE D TOO TO D FOR RATIO IS GREATER IN SELF REPORTED FEMALES THEN IT IS IN MALES WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT MEANS THAT THAT THAT DIDGIT D TOO AND D FOR ARE MORE SIMILAR IN LENGTH IN FEMALES THN IN MALES AND THE EFFECT IS PERNIC PARTICULARLY EXCUSE ME PRONOUNCED ON THE RIGHT HAND ALTHOUGH NOT ALWAYS OK AND DOES NOT HAVE TO DO WITH HANDEDNESS THIS D TWO TO D FOR DIFFERENCE HAS TO BE MEASURED CORRECTLY YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK AT SOMEBODY'S HANDS AND SAY OH YOU KNOW THERE A RING FINGER AND INDEX FINGER ARE VERY SIMILAR AND THEREFOR THEY ARE FEMALE IN A YOU KNOW IT WHERE THEY WERE EXPOSED TO VERY LITTLE TESTOSTERONE IN UTERO OM YOU CAN'T LOOK AT SOMEBODY AND SEE THAT THEIR INDEX FINGER IS MUCH SHORTER THAN THER RING FINGER AND SAY OH YOU KOW THEY MUST HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO A LOT OF ANDRGEN YOU HAVE TO YOU ACTUALLY MEASURE IT IND ACTO MEASURE IT CORRECTLY YOU HAVE TO MEASURE IT FROM THE BASE OF THE FINGER WHERE THERE'S THAT FIRST CREASE ALL THE WAY TO THE TIP PASS THE A YOU CAN'T INCLUDE THE FINGER NAILS OF YOUR GOING FINGER NAILS OU BE LOGICAL HER FOLKS SO YOU CAN'T NORMALLY SEE IT FROM IT FROM IT THE BACK OF THE HAND AL THOUGH INOIF THIS WILL SHOW AP HERE BUT O IF YOU LOOK AT THE BACK OF THE HAND SOMETIMES YOU CAN SEE IT YOU KNOW MY CASE FOR INSTANCE ON I SEE IF I CAND THIS SO MY DEFOR IS A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN MY D TO IN SOME PEOPLE IT'S MORE PRONOUNCED AND THAT'S ON MY RIGHT HAND ON THE OTHER HAND THE DIFFERENCE ACTIO IS FAR LESS PRONOUNCES IT'S A LITTLE BIT IT'S A LITTLE BIT PRONOUNCED THERE BUT NOT SO MUCH OKE SO THAT SORT OF THE TYPICAL RATIO THAT YOU WOULD SEE TURNS OUT THAT IN MICE END IN HUMANS THE MORE ANDROGEN THAT YOU WARE EXPOSED TO IN UTERO THE SMALLER THE DEFOR D TO RATIO MEANING THAT THE RING FINGER TENDS TO BE SLIGHTLY LONGER THAN THE POINTER FINGER AND IN FEMALES BECAUSE THEY'RE EXPOSED TO LESS ANDROGEN IN UTDERO TYPICALLY THEND THOSE FINGERS TEND TO BE MORE EQUAL IN LATE AND THESE ARE SEBTLE DIFFERENCES AND THESE ARE AVERAGES I INVITE YOU TO LOOK UP THE PAPER THIS WAS PUBLISHIN NATURE IN TWO THOUSAND AND IT'S BEEN REPLICATED SIX TIMES NOW HERE'S WHERE IT GETS EVEN MORE INTERESTING ND POTENTIALLY PRECARIOUS SO ORGAN A STEP CAUTIOUSLY HERE IF YOU LOOK AT THE FINGER LENGTH RATIOS OF MEN THAT SELF REPORT AS HOMOSEXUAL THEY HAVE EITHER THE TYPICAL MALE PATTERN OF D TU DO DFOR RATIO ORE A HYPER MASCULINIZED DFOR TO D TWO RATIO NOW THIS CAN'T BE SOMETHING THAT'S ESTABLISHED OR MODIFIED BY BEHAVIOR THIS HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT WAS ESTABLISH IN UTERO AND IN FACT IT'S PRESENT AT BIRTH OK SO IT COMPLETELY DIVORCES THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN HORMONES IN BEHAVIOR AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING HA WEVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AN ORGCAN TALK ABOUT EVEN MORE NEXT EPISODE IS THAT HORMONE'S IMPACT BEHAVIOR BUT BEHAVIOR ALSO IN PACT HORMONS BUT THIS IS A CASE OF HORMONE'S IMPACTING WHAT REALLY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A PRIMARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTIC BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SHOW UP IN PUBERITY IT SHOWS UP BEFORE PUBERTY S ACTUALLY ESTABLISHED IN UTERO AND IN PEOPLE THAT SELF REPORTED LESBIANS AND I REMEMBER GOING OUT THERE AND COLLECTING THESE DATO WITH WITH THESE A WITH THE COLLABORATORS ON THIS WORK AGAIN I WASN'T THE MAIN DRIVER ON THE WORK BUT I PARTICIPATED SOME OF THE ANALYSIS PEOPLE THAT SELF REPORT IS LESBIANS ALSO TEND TO HAVE A SMALLER D TO TO DEFOR RATIO SO THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE AUDICUSTEC COMMISSION STUDY THAT DENAS MAC PHATEN HAD PUBLISHED AND IT POINTS TO THE FACT THAT EARLY EXPOSURE TO ANDROGENS MAY HAVE AN IMPACT NOT JUST ON ANDROD ANDROGESIZATIEN OF THE BODY PLAN BUT ALSO SEPARATELY ON SEXUAL PREFERENCE NOW THIS RAISES ALL SORTS OF INTERESTIN QUESTIONS ABOUT BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF SEXUAL PREFERENCE I'LL TELLYOU ABOUT ANOTHER STUDY A GONAME SIMON LEVAY WHO IS AT UCIALE WHO TRAINED UNDER HUBON VEASEL IF ANY OF YOU REMEMBER EARLY EPISODES ON PLASTESY DAVID HUBO AND TORENSOME RESIL BY SCIENTIFIC GREAT GRANDPARENTS ONE THE NOBELL PRIZE FOR DISCOVERY OF CRITICAL PERIODS FOR BRAIN PLASTICITY THEY DEFINE SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF HOW WE SEE AN BRAIN PLASTICITY SIMON LEVA TRAINED WITH THEM AND THEN SIMON WENT ON TO DISCOVER THAT IN THE BRAINS OF PEOPLE THAT SELF REPORT HOMOSEXUAL THERE IS A BRAIN DIFFERENCE AND THE BRAIN DIFFERENCES IN AN ERA CALLED THE INTERSTITIAL NUCLIUS OF THE ANTERIOR HYPOPHALEMUS SO IT'S THE IN A H AND SO THERE ARE PUBLISHED REPORTS THAT WAS PULISHAN SCIENCE THE OTHER WORK I REFER TO IS PUBLISH IN NATURE AND THEN REPLICATED NO FEWER THAN SIX TIMES AND THE MAC FATIN RESULTS THAT POINT TO STRONG BIOLOGICAL COROLETS OF MATE CHOICE OF SEXUAL PREFERENCE AND THESE TI DIRECTLY TO THINGS LIKE ANDRODODENIZATION OR ESTROGENIZATION MEANING WE COULD CALL IT MALENESS OR FEMALENESS BUT THAT SORT OF TRICKY TERRITORY BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT WE DESCRIBE THE HUGE RANGE IN WHICH SEX CAN BE DEFINED EARLIER SO IF YOU WANT TO MEASURE D TU DEFORATIO YOU'RE WELCOME TO BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S NOT PREDICTIVE OF ANYTHING RIGHT IT'S JUST A WINDOW INTO THE POSSIBLE ANDROGEN EXPOSURE THAT YOU HAD EARLIER IN LIFE THEREARE PLENTY OF HETEROS MEN WHO REPORT HET THEMSELVES AS HETEROSEXUAL WHOARE OUT THERE WHO HAVE SIMILAR YOUILL HAVE A DETU DFORATIOES TO FEMALES AND THERE PLENTY OF FEMALES WHOSE INDEX FINGERS ARE SHORTER THAN THER RING FINGERS AND THEIRE PERFECTLY HAPPY OR THEY SAY THEIR PERFECTLY HAPPY AND WE ARE INCLINED TO BELIEVE THEM BEING HETEROSEXUAL SO THERE'S VARIATION IF FACT MART TELLS A REALLY GOOD JOKE IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHETHER NOT SOMEBODY IS HOMOSEXUAL OR HETEROSEXUAL SIMPLY LOOK AT THEIR HANDS LOOK AT THEIR D TU DEFOR RATIO AND GES HETEROSEXUAL AND YOU'LL BE RIGHT NINETY SEX PER CENT OF THE TIME BECAUSE NINETY SIX PERCENT OF THE TIME PEOPLE REPORT THEMSELVES AS HETERO SEXUAL ON AVERAGE THOSE NUMBERS MIGHT BE CHANGING SO THE JOKE REALLY IS A JOKE ON SCIENCE BECAUSE THAT FALLS WITHIN THE REALM OF STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND YET IT REALLY ILLUSTRATES THE FACT THAT NONE OF THIS IS CAUSAL BUT IT'S NONE THE LESS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT HORMONS ARE ORGANIZING THE BRAIN EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT IN WAYS THAT CAN POTENTIALLY IMPACT SAME OR OPPOSITE SEX PARTNER CHOICE LATER IN LIFE NOW OF COURSE THEIRE OTHER THINGS THAT CAN IMPACT OPPOSITE SEX OR SAME SEX PARTNER CHOICE LATER IN LIFE THE STUDY DID NOT LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO REPORTED BY SEXUAL THERE HASN'T BEEN A LOT OF STUDIES ON THAT YET ONE THING THAT'S VERY INTERESTING FOR WHICH THEIRE SOME GOOD SCIENTIFIC DATA BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME CONTROVERSY IS THAT IT APPEARS THAT THE PROBABILITY OF A MALE HUMAN SELF REPORTING AS HOMOSEXUAL INCREASES WITH THE NUMBER OF OLDER BROTHERS THAT HE HAS NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN IF YOU HAVE AN OLDER BROTHER EVEN IF YOU HAVE TEN OLD OR BROTHERS THAT YOU ARE SURE TO SELF REPORT AS HOMOSEXUAL BUT THE STATISTICALLY IT BECOMES MORE LIKELY THAT SOMEBODY WILL WITH EACH SUCCESSIVE OLDER BROTHER THAT THEY HAVE AND THE IDEA THAT STARTING TO EMERGE IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL NURROW ENDER CHRONOLOGY LANDSCAPE IS THAT THERE'S A RECORD WITHIN THE MOTHER OF HOW MANY MALE PETUSES SHE'S CARRIED BECAUSE MALE PHETUSES ARE SECRETING CERTAIN THINGS DOHYDROTOSTOSTERONE OTHER THINGS THAT CAN FEED BACK ON TO THE GENOME SO THESE COUND BE EPIGENOMIC EFFECTS OR ON TO THE PLOCENTA ITSELF SO THAT THERE'S A HIGHER PROBABILITY AND SUBSEQUENT PREGNANCIES THAT OFFSPRING WILL SELF REPORT AS HOMOSEXUAL SOCH A FASCINATING AREA OF BIOLOGY AND AS YOU'VE NOTICED TO DAY NONE OF THIS DEALS WITH THE CURRENT CONTROVERSIES AROUND GENDER AND HOW MANY GENDERS AND SECTS ET CETERA THAT'S A SEPARATE CONVERSATION THAT IS BY DEFINITION GROUNDED IN THE KIND OF CONCEPTS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TO DAY AND NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE TAKING TO CONSIDERATION ALL OF THE ASPECTS OF SECTS AND THE EFFECTS OF HORMONES BOTH ON THE BODY ON THE BRAIN WE DIDN'T TALK ALOUT ABOUT SPINAL CORT BUT WE WILL IN THE NEXT EPISODE ON BUT WE CAN JUST SAY ON THE BRAIN AND THE PERIPHERY EARLY EFFECTS LAT EFFECTS ACUTEFFECTS MEANING EFFECTS THAT ARE VERY FAST OF LEVELS OF HORMONES GOING UP OR DOWN SOMETHING THAT ABSOLUTELY HAPPENS DURING AND ACROSS THE MENSTRUAL CYCAL AS WELL AS LONG TERMEFFECTS LIKE THE EFFECTS OF THESE HORMONES ON GENE EXPRESSION SO TO DAY AS ALWAYS WE WEREN'T ABLE TO COVER ALL THINGS RELATED TO SECTS AND HORMONES AND SECTUAL DIFFERENTIATION OR DEVELOPMENT THERE'S NO WAY WE COULD BUT WE HAVE COVERED A LOT OF MATERIAL WE TALKED ABUT SOME EFFCTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS WE TALKED ABOUT POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF SELPHONE RADIATION SOMETHING I NEVER THOUGHT THAT I WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT SPECIALLY NOT IN APODCAST BUT FOR WHICH THERE ARE INTERESTING EMERGING DATA WE TALKED ABOUT CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT EVENING PRIMROS OIL AND ITS ESTROGENIC EFFECTS ABOUT CREATINE AND ITS PRODIAE T EFFECTS ABOUT CANOPUS ALCOHOL ABOUT PLANTS EXERTING WARFARE ON ANIMALS BY INCREASING O ROMATACES THE CONVERSION OF TESTOSTRONE TO ESTROGEN WE TALKED ABOUT HYENAS WITH GIANT CLITERUSES AND WE TALKED ABOUT MOLES THAT CAN VERT FROM HAVING OVERIES TO  A TETESTICALS AND THROUGHOUT THIS COSTELLO HAS BEEN SNORING NON STOP HE MISSED ALL OF IT ALTHOUGH HE MIGHT BE LEARNING IT IN HIS SLEEP OF FOR ALL I KNOW AND I DO UNDERSTAND ITS A LOT OF INFORMATION A LOT OF DETAIL AS ALWAYS I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO ABSORB ALL THE INFORMATION AT ONTE NEXT EPISODE WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF SECTS THE VERB ACTUAL REPRODUCTION WERE ALSO GEN BE TALKD ABOUT EFFECTS OF HORMONES ON VARIOUS ASPECTS OF BEHAVIOR AND WAGS TO MODULATE HORMONES THROUGH THE USE OF BEHAVIOR SUPPLEMENTATION ALL SO WILL TOUCH ON DIET AND NUTRITION A BIT AND WE'REGONG TO TALK ABOUT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THOSE THINGS END BEHAVIOR AS THEY RELATE TO IMPORTANT THEMES LIKE SEX IN REPRODUCTION LIKE WORK PLACE PERFORMANCE LIKE MOTIVATION AND DRIVE AND EVEN ANXIETY THERE'S A VERY INTERESTING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HORMONS AND ANXIETY AND THE DESIRE TO EXPLORE NOVELTY SO JUST REMEMBER AS WE GO FORWARD THAT HORMONES AFFECT BEHAVIOR AND BEHAVIOR AFFECTS HORMONS BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT CUTTING OFF YOUR INDEX FINGER WILL INPRECE YOUR TESTOSTERONE MANY OF YOU HAVE ASKED HOW

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE PRICES TANK AS BANKS STRUGGLES TO STAY AFLOAT JO BITON CUTS AMERICAN DRILLING AS SOUT TY ARABIA CUTS THE OIL SUPPLY AND DAVID WHITES SEEKS A GRAN JERY INTIPEMEN AGAINST HUNTER BIDON AT LAST FOR A GUN CRIME AND BENTUNR OF THIS IS THE BENCH VEROSHO THE SHOWS PONSER BY EXPRESS VEPIANS TIME TO STANDS UP AGAINST BIGTUT  PROTECTOR DATA EXPRESS VU PANS I COUM FLESHBEN SO WE KEEP HERING OVER AND OVER THAT THE ECONOMY IS ON SOFT FOOTING YOU KNOW THAT THAT INALALL BE FINE WE AN TO HAVE A SOFT LANDING HERE THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO BE VERY STRONG BECAUSE PONOMER SAN AND ALL THE REST OF THITS HERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS THERE'S A STORY THAT COMES OUT THEYREMINDS US HOW FRAUAL THE ECONOMY ACTUALLY IS AND THET IT WOULDN'T TAKE A LOT TO TIP THE ECONOMY OVER THE EDGE HERE'S THE THING ABOUT ECONOMIC CRASH IS OR OR ECONOMIC SPIRALS EVERYBODY KNOWS THEY'RE COMING ETS JUST O QUESTION OF WEN IF YOU ARE A TRADER IN TE STOCK MARKET ONE OF THE HARD THINGS ABOUT BEING A TRADER IN THE STOCK MARKET FOR EXAMPLE IS KNOWING WEN TOO SHORT A STOCK WHEN I SAY WEN TO SHORT STOCK ONOMY THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE STOCK IS GETTN GO DOWN PROBABLY YOU KNOW THE STOCKSKIN GO DOWN THE PROBLEMIS WHAT'S THE TIME LINE YOU SHORT IT FOR A WEEK FOR A MONTH FOR A YEAR HOW LONGED YOU SHORT THE STOCKLOAT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE STOCK OF THE AMERICAN CONOMY AS A WHOLE IT SEEMS LIKE YOU WANT A SHORT O BUT YOU DON'T SHURT EXACTLY WEN BECAUSE THE TFACT IS THAT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS NOT IN FACT ON SOFTER OR EVEN SOLID FOOTING IT IIS ITIS IN FACT RESTING ON A PRECIPICE AND WHICH SDON'T KNOW WHAT SORT OF WIND IS GOING TO BLOW THAT KNOCKS IT OVER THE EDD TO DAY'S STORY COMES CURTESY OF THE WALL STREET JOURNAL BANK OZ K HAD TWO BRANCHES AND RURAL ARK INSALL WHEN SHIEFE EXECUTIVE GEORGE GLEESE AND BLOUGHT IT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE THE LITTLE ROCK LENDER TO DAY HAS BUILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN OMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS INCLUDING FOR PROPERTIES IN MYAMY AND MANHATTON WHERE ITS HELPING FUN THE CONSTRUCTION OF ONE THOUSAND FOOT TALL OFFICE AND LUXURY RESIDENTIAL TOWER N FIFTH AVENUE WREGURAL BANKS ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOLLOWED O SIM LAR PLAYBOOK GORGING ON COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS AN RELATING INVESTMENTS IN BIG CITIES OVER THE PAST ECCADE BUT THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKET NOW AND MELT DOWN THOSE TRULLIANS OF DOLLARS AND LOANS AND INVESTMENTS ARE LOOMING THRAT FOR THE BANKING INDUSTRY AND POTENTIALLY THE BROADER ECONOMY BANKS EXPOSURE IS EVEN BIGGER THAN CONNOMLY REPORTED THE BANKS ARE IN DANGER F SETTING OFF A DOOMA LOUPSINAREO IT'S ALWAYS GOOD STUFF  THAT THAT'S HAT YOU LOOK FOREIGNEUR MORNING PAPERS THE DOOM LOUPSINARIA THEY'RE IN DANGER OF SETTNG FF A DOOM LOOPSINAREO WHERE LOSS IS ON THE LOANS TRIGGER BANKS TO CUT LONDING WHICH LEADS YOU FURTHER DROPS AN PROPERTY PRICES AND YET MORE LOSSES AND THE PROBLEM OF COURSE IS THAT YOU MAND UP WITH A FOUR CLOSER SPIRAL KIND OF LAKE YOU SAW IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTY THOUSAND IGHT TDOUS IN THE RESIDENTIAL REAL ISTATE MARKET BECAUSE BASICALLY PEOPLE COULD NOT PAY BACK THEYR'RE SOME PRIME LOANS BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LARGE COMMERCIAL ENTITIES THAT SIMPLY STOP PAYING THE'RE THEY'RE LOANS WHEN THEY'RE BUILDING A BUILDING WHENTHE'R DOING AT DEVELOPMENT SOND THESE THINGS COME ON THE MARKET BUT NOBODY WANTS TO BUY THEM BECAUSE WE THNK THEY'RE GOING TO GET CHEAPER FOR EXAMPLE BANKOS K IS NOT PULL BACK FROM LENDING BUT HAS STARTED SEE SOME TIMES OF MARKET TROUBLE IN JANUARY A DEVELOP OR DEFAULTS AN ON A ROUGHLY SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR LOAN FROM BANKOS DECAY AFTER CONSTRUCTION COSTS ESCOLATED THE BANKS THAT IS ANOTHER PROTM IN FLATION HAS DRIVEN UP THE COSTS OF CONSTRUCTION WILDLY SO EVERYBODY'S BUDGET FROM JANUARY NO LONGER APPLIES IF YOU GOT SOME SORT OF SPECK BUDGET FROM EVEN SOMEBODY WHO'S WORKING ON YOUR HOME BACK IN JANUARY THIS HIS ECTURY HAPEN T US AND THEN YOU SAY WHAT WE WANT YOU TO DO THE CONSTRUCTION BUT IT'S NOW SEPTEMBER WILL YOU GIVE US THAT SAME PRICETHE'L TELL YOU KNOW THET' SOR THE PRICE IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER TBECAUSE OF THE PRICES OF THE MATERIALS AND THE PRICES OF THE LABOR THE LOAN WAS CON SIDERD RELATIVELY SAFE BECAUSE IT WAS FAR BELOW THE BUILDING SITES VALUE OF A HUNDRED THIRTY NINE MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT IN DECEMBER A NEW APRASEL PUT THE PROPERTIES VALUE AT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THE BANK IS NOT EFFECTIVELY STUCK WITH THE PROPERTY TO DAYS TROUBLE MARKET FEEL BY RISING INTERESTRACES AND HIGH VACANCIES FOLLOWS YEARS OF BOOM TIMES THANKS ROUGHLY DOUBLED THEIR LENDING TO LANDLORDS FROM FWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY TO TO TWO POINT TO TRILLION DOLLARS ALSO BANKS INCREASED THEIR EXPOSURE T OMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE AND WAYS THAT AREN'T USUALLY COUNTED IN THEIR TALLIES THEY LENT TO FINANCIAL COMPANIES THET MAKE LOANS TO SEME THE SAME LANDLORDS THET BASICLLY USING IT AS A PASS THROUG THEY BOUGHT BONDS BACK BY THE SAME TYPES OF PROPERTIES SO IN THE SAME WAY THAT BAD REAL ESTATE LOANS ENDID UP BEING SLICED AN VACED A THOUSAND DIFFERENT WAYS THROUGH CREDIT INSTRUMENTS BACKIN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT YET WHAT BASICALLY THEY TOOK A MUNCH OF BAD SUP PRAMALONS IN THEY STACK THEM UP WITH GOOD LOANS THAN THEY CALLED IT A LEVEL LOANS AND THEY SOLD THAT THOUGHUT THE BROADER ECONOMY AND THAT'S WHY ONCE THE INFECTIONS SET IN IT INFECTED EVERY PART THE BOADER ECONOMY THE SAME THING HAS HAPPENED WITH COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE BECAUSE YOU HAVE PEOPLE ARE BASICALLY SLACING INVICING THESE LOANS OR THEIR BANG BONDS THAT ARE BACK BY THE LOANS THE INDIRECT LENDING ALONG WITH FOUR CLOSE PROPERTIES TRADING PORTFOLOES ANOTHER ASSETS LINK TO COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES BRINGS BANKS TOTAL EXPOSURE TO COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE TWO THREE POINTSIX TRILLION DOLLARS EQUIVALENT TO TWENTY PER CENTS OF THEIR DEPOSITS BY BY THE WY YOU CAN SEE THIS IN REAL TIME AGAIN I KNOW LOT OF PEOPLE WHOARE IN THE REAL ESTATE NVESTMEN INDUSTRY AND WHEN IT COMES TO OMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE THAT IS NOT IN INDUSTRY THAT YOU WANT TO BE IN RIGHT UP BUT THEY'RE A LOT OF BANKS THATARE ALIONS ON COMMERCIAL  COMPANIES COMERCIAL REAL STAY COMPANYES PAYING BACK THEY'RE LOANS MEANWHILE ALSO ACCORDING TOTHE WALSTR JOURNAL IN FLATION AND INTERESTR WORIDES CONTINUED TO DRAG STOCKS DOWNWARD STOCK SLUMPED ON LENESDAY AFTER INVESTERS RECEIVED A FRESH SIGN THE OSE ECONOMY  COULD BE REVING UP FANDING THOSE IN FLATION TURES IN FLATIONS NOT GOING AWAY BECS AGAIN IT IS NOT JUST THE PRODUCT OF LAST YEARS OF SPENDING ITIS THE PRODUCT OF TWENTY YEARS BASICALLY OF INCREDIBLY LOOSE SPENDING BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND BY THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT OF THE UNITED STATES QUANTITATIVE EASING BECAME THE ORDER OF THE DAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWO THOUSAN A BUT EASY MONEY PREVAILED UP UN TIL TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IF YOU GO ACK AND LOK AT THE MORTGAGE RADES IN THEYOURE TWO THOUSAND MORTGAY'S RATES IN THE IR TWO THOUSIMOR LIKE FIVE SIX SEVEN PER CENT BUT FOR MOST OF THE FOLLOWING TWO DECATES THE MORTGAGE RATES WERE IN THE TWOTHERE FOUR PER CENT RANGE AND THAT IS BECAUSE OF EASY MONEY WELL THE PROBLEM WITH EASY MONEY IS THAT MAKES PEOPLE MAKE LOOSE DECISIONS RAISIN THE IN YOUR OWN LIFE THE GENERAL ACCONOMY RUNS KIND OF LAKER HOUSEHOLD IN THIS WAY IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF MONEY LYING AROUND YOU DON'T THINK THAT MUCH ABOUT O CAVE FINE SO I WASTED LITTLE MONEY ON A DINNER OR I WASTED LITTLE MONEY ON ON A PARTICULAR EVENT WHON THE GREAT EVENT BUT WE HAVE THE MONEY SO WHO CARED THE SAME THING IS TRUE WHEN IT COMES TO INVESTORS WHEN INVESTERS HAVE A LOT OF MONEY IN THEIR POCKET THE GET VERY BREEZY ABOUT GIVING THAT MONEY AWAY AND THEN WHEN TH MONEY TIGHTENS UP SUDDENLY THEY OVER COMPENCATE IS A FREATED OUT AND WAY I DON'T WANT TO SPEND THAT MONEY EVER EVER EVER AGAIN AND THAT'S WHEN THE ECONOMY SEARCHD TO GRIND TO A SCREECHING HALL THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW THUGH THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'SBEN IN FLEETED INTO THE CURRENCYT MEANS THE PEOPLE STILL HAVE A LOT OF MONEY IN THEIR POKET IN S PROTUR PARTICULARLY TRU IN CONSUMER ARCETS CONSUMER MARKETS TENTO REACTS AFTER BUSINESS PEOPLE BUSINESS PEOPLE THE ONES I KNOW THEYARE READY STARNING PULLBACK THEY'RE READY STARTING TO REALIZE THAT THE ECONOMY IS IS GETTING WORSE BUT THE EVERYDAY CONSUMER HAS SEEN A TUN OF MONEY BLOWN IN THEIR POCKET OVER THE COURSE OF LAST COUPLE OF DECATES WHICH IS WHY PRICES ARE REALLY HIGH AND THEN THEY STILL HAVE TO SPEND ON NECESSITIES SO THAT ISN'T GOING AWY BUT THE CONSUMER PULL BACK HAS YET TO REALLY TAKE A FACT BECAUSE ITS NON THE INTEREST OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT O MANY STAKE GOVERNMENTS TO ALLOW THE ECONOMY TO GO BACK TO IT'S RESTING NORMAL THIS IS ONE OF THE HUGE PROBIS OF THE EASY MONEY POLICIES EATING MONEY POLICIES MAKE PEOPLE THE ELECE TO GOOD TIMES AREGING TO GO ON FOREVER ANSTIT ACTUALLY EXASCERBATES THE SO CALLED BOOMBUSS CYCLE IF YOUSHAVE A STABLE MONITARY SUPPLY WELL HEUENEEG AT BOOMS IN ENEA BUS BUT YOU ARE ALSO GOING TO GET REAL GROW WHEN YOU HAVE INFLECIAN FUELD GROWTH WHAT YOU GET AS A LOT OF SPECULATION AND THE SPECUULATION LEADS TO THES REALLY DRAMATIC DOWN TURNS AND HE PEOPLE USUALLY AND OP GETTING HIT ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT THESE SOPHISTICATED PLAYERS IN THE MARKET S THAT'S AS HAPPENING IN JO BIDON'S ECONOMY HES NOW EXASCERBATING THAT THROUGH FOOLISH ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY W'LL GET TO THAT MOMENTARILY FIRST FLADMER PUDIN HAS CALLED THE STOLLARS DROP IN TOMINANT'S OBJECTIVE IN YOUR REVERSIBLE BRAZIL RUSSIA INDO A CHINA SOUTH AFRICA THEY FORMERLY AGREED TO USE A LOCAL CURRENCIES IN TRADE INSTEAD OF THE OSTOLLAR IT'S THE FIRST SHOOE TO DROP AS THE MAN FORE THE DOLAR START STO WEAKEN THE BUYING POWER OF THE DOLLAR IS GOING TO WEAKEN AS WELL BIRCHGOLD IS BUSIER THANEVER BOTTOM LINE IS THIS YOU HAVE A LOT OF CENTRAMICE THEIR MANIPULATING CURRENCIES AND THE BASIC HEAGE AGAINS ALL OF THAT IS PRECIOUS METALS INVESTMENT IN VESTORS AND SAVORS ARE LOOKING TO HARNESS THE POWER OF PHYSICAL GOLD HELD IN A TAX SHELTER T IRA I BIGOLD FROM BERCHULL THAT TRUST THEM TO HELP ME DIVERSIFI MY SAVINGS YOU CAN PROTECT OUR IRA OR FOR ONE CAYE BY DIVERSIFYING WITH GOLD FROM UT BIRCH GOLD AS THE OSTOLAR CONTINUES TO RECEIVE PRESSURE FROM FORN COUNTRIES TIGURAL

NINETY EIGHT NINETY EIGHT NINETYEIGHT TO GET STARTED TO DAY O CAN MEANWHILE YOU WOULD THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU DON'T WANT IS A REINFLATION OF OF OIL PRICES AND YET THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT JOBIDON IS NOW PURSUING IT REALLYES MANS THERE'S A LOT OF FOCAS THAT'S BEING PUT ON THE FACT THAT THE SOUTIES OUR CUTTING OIAL PRODUCTION UNTIL THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE ACCORDING TO AXIOS THIS IS BECAUSE THE SOUTIES ARE DEEPLY UN HAPPYWITH THE BY NAD INISTRATION AND THEY WISH TO SE THE BY NAMINISTRATION GOLAY THEY WANTO SEE DONAL TRUMP OR SOME OTHE RE PUBLICAN ELECTED WILL BE FRIENDLIER TOWARD SATY ARABIDO THAT WOULDN'T BE A SHOP SADYORABIA HAS ITS OWN INTERNATIONAL INTEREST AND TO BE FRANK THE BIDYD MINISTRATIONS POSITION ON SADYARABIA IS UTTERLY ONTENTABLE AND FOOLISH WHICH IS WHY JOBIDON BEFORE HE TOOK OFFICE WAS RIPPING ON THE SOUTIES IN THIR HUMAN RIGTS FIOLATIONS  MEANWHILE HE'S MAKING NICE TO THE ARONEANS WO AR WAY WORST HUMAN RIZE VIOLATORS THAN THE SOUTIES LIKE BITE BY LEAGUES AND SCORSE AND THEN HE ENDED UP HAVING TO GO ON BENDED NEE BEFORE THE MIDTROM ELECTIONS TO THE SOUTIES AND BEG THEM TO AIS THE OIL PRODUCTION SO THE SOUTIES OUR SAYING NO WE'RE NOT REAL FOND OF YOU WE SEE THAT YOU YOU KIND OF WANT TO UNDER COT WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE TO THE SOUTIES ARE ARE JACKING UP THE OIL PRICES YOU US GASS PRICES ACORDING TO AXIOS ARE CLOSELY TEOTHERE TO GLOBAL OIL PRICES MEANWHILE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAGN SEASON IS HEATING UP IF SUSTAIN CRUE PRICE STRENGTH COULD WAY ON PRESIDENTIOBINE'S RE ELECTION BID ACORING TO CLEAR VIEW ENERGY PARTNERS THE KINGDOM SAID TUESDAY MORNING IT'S KEEPING THE CUR REDUCTION OF A MILLION BARRELS DAY IN PLACE FOR ANOTHER THREE MONTHS SUBJECT TO MONTHLY REVIEW ROSHO IS ALSO COMBINING TO DO THIS THE'RE ALSO CUTTING THEIR INTERNATIONAL OIL SUPPLY AGAIN IN ATTEMPT TO DRIVE DOWN  PEOPLE FIGHTING THEM IN THE CRANE WAR TUESDAYS NEWS HALT PUSH PRENT CREWD PRICES ABOVE IT NINETY DOLLARS PERBAREL THAT'S THE HIGHEST SINCE NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWO OFFICIALS ARE HOLDING THE FIRE FOR NOW BECAUSE IT'S STI FAR FROM THE ELECTION THE HOPING MAY BE THE SOUTY'S BACK OFF IT THIS BUT WHAT'S AMAZING ABOUT THIS IS THAT THERE IS A WAY FOR JOBINE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND HOU BE THEWAY THE DONAL TRUMP TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS WHEN I TURNED OUT THAT OIL PRICES WERE WERE PETTY HIGH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TRUMPADMINISTRATION DONAL TRUM FOCIST ON INCREASING AMERICAN DOMESTIC OIL PRODUCTION WHICH IS WHY WE HAD AN OIL SURPLUS BY THE TIME THAT THAT DONAL TRUMP LEFT OFFICE JOBI HES BEEN PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE IN TE MIDDLE OF A TIME WHEN AMERICANS ARE GOTING GOING TO BE PAYNG MAR T PUMP  JOBINE IS BEHOLDIN TO HIS LEFT WING BAYS WHICH MEANS THAT HE IS NOW WORKING TO PRO HIBIT DRILLING IN THE  NATIONAL PATROLEUM RESERVE AT THE ARCTIC NATURAL WILA REFUGE NO THE ANOUIR HAS BEEN A POINT OF CONTENTION SINCE I WAS IN COLLEGE INTUCKING LIKE TWENTY FIVE YEARS THAT'S BEEN A POINT OF CONTENTION THE BASIC ARGUMENT THATS MADE BY VIR MENTALUS AS YO CAN'T DRILL IN THIS PRISTINE NATURAL HABITAT AND THE ARGUMENT MADE BY PEOPLE WHO ARE DRILLING FOR OIL IS IT'S A PRETTY SMALL FOOT PRINT IN A VERY VERY LARGE AREA IT IS NOT ACTUALLY KILLING THE WILD LIFE IN FACT TO TURNS OUT THAT THE CARABOO KINA LIKEIT BEING WARM INSO THE TEND TO HANG OUT AROUND THE OIL PIE BLINDS IN THE MATE I'M BUT BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ECONOMIC DOWN TURN OR POTENTIALLY CONOMIC DOWN TURN CUTTING OFF YOUR OWN ACCESS TO OIL IS AN IDIOT MOVE AND THIS ALWAYSBEE THE PROBLEM WITH JOBIDON IN REFERENCE TO THE OIL INDUSTRY AT THE SAME TIME HE WANTS TO CLAIM THT HE IS HELPING EVERY DAY AMERICANS TO BY THE WAY DON ALL OWN TESTALAS AT THE SAME TIME HE SAYING THAT HE IS SIMULTANEOUSLY TAKING EVERY POLICY HE CAN MANGION IN ORDER CUT OFF DOMESTIC OIL SUPPLIES ME HE IS SET THAT HE WANTS TO CUT OFF THE ABILITY TO DRILL OFF SHORE IN IN LARGE SUAVES OF OF AMERICAN COSTAL WATERS HE IS NOW SAYING HE DOESN'T WANTO BE ABLE TO DRILL IN THE ANOAR SO WHAT EXACTLY IS THE PLAN FOR OIL IN DEPENDENCE FOR EXAMPLE WMOST Y REAL ABOUT THI FOSSIL FUEL PRODUCTION IS GOING TO BE CRUCIAL TO THE AMERICAN ECONOMY FOR DECADES TO COME NOT FRE YEARS TO COME FOR DECADES TO COME THIS BAZAR NOTION THAT EVEN THE ELECTRICAL GRID IT'S POWERABLE WITHOUT CARBON BASE FOSSIL FUELS OR MASSIVE BUILDING OF NUCLAR POWER PLANTS IS IDIOTIC IT AN'T CAN BE DONE ON WINDMILLS AN ELECTRICITY DOESN'T COME FROM ITSELF THID THERE SEEMS TO BE A THEORY WHEN IT COMES TO ENERGY PRODUCTION ON THE LEFT THE BASICALY THE WAY YOU CREATE ENERGY IS THAT FAMOUS MEAM OF PLUGGING A PLUG INTO ITSELF THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM ELECTRICITY NO IT DOESN'T THE ELECTRICITY THAT'S IN THE POWER GRID GENERALLY COMES FROM FOSSIL FUEL PRODUCTION THAT IS WHERE IT IS COMING FROM OR FOSSILFU L USE AND YET JOBIDON IS CUTTING OFF ALL OF THAT AND THEN SIMULTANEOUSLY TELLINGYOU THAT HE STANDING FOR TH LITTLE GOT LET ME TSOMLING YOUR PEOPLE WHO ARE RICH WE CAN AFFORD HIGRER ENERGY PRICES WE CAN AFFORD TO KEEP OUR AR AR A C ON SIXTY EIGHT ALL A YEAR BUT LET ME TELL YOU EN WHEN WE WORT RICH WHEN I A WHEN I WAS GROWING UP WE KEPT OUR A C A MUCH HIGHER TEMPERATURE BECAUSE THE POWER BILLS ACTUALLY MATTER TO LOTMOR SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING A BETTER EGRESSIVE INCOME TAX IN CREASING THE PRICEOFENERGY IS A DRAMATICALLY REGRESSIVE INCOME TAX ON PEOPLE WHO ARE POOR ON PEOPLE WOR MIDDLE CLASS AND YIT THE BIT ADMINISTRATION IS BEHOLD INTO ITS RADICAL INVIRONMENTAL BAYS AND SO THE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE THE AVERAGE ORDINARY AMERICAN WHAT YOU HAVE TO PAY AT THE PUMP WHOR WHAT LEFT TO PAYINGYOR INDIRECT ENERGY BILLS THE NEW REGULATIONS WOULD ENSURE WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION CALLED MAXIMUM PROTECTIONS FROM NEARLY HALF THE PATROLION RESERVE IT WOULDN'T STOP THE ENORMOUS EIGHT BUILLINGDOLLAR WILLOW OILS ROLLING PROJECT IN THE SAME VICINITY BIDINT A PROVE THAT THE SEREBUTS PUTTING MORE OF THE OF THE ONOIR OFF LIMITS HE SAID WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT US TREASURED REGION FOR ALL AGES BY THE WAY THE NUMBER OF VISERS TO THESE REGIONS OF THE HONOIR IS MINNABLE IT AIN'T AIN'T GIANT TOURBUSSES HEADING OFF TO THE ONOIR  CANCELLING ALL REMAINING OILING GASLES IS ISSUED UNDER THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION IN THE ARCTIC REFUGE AND PROTECTING MORE THAN THIRTEEN MILLION ACRES IN THE WESTERN ARCTIC WHELL HELP PRESERVE OUR ARCTIC LANDS AND WILD LIFE WILE HONORING THE CULTUR HISTORY AND ENDURING WISTOM OF ALASCANATIVES WE'VE LIVED ON THESE LANDS SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL SO OM AGAIN IN VARMONT UNTIL MON PROVATS GOT MATDED HIM OVER THE WILLOW PROJECTS O HE IS TRYING TO BACK FILL THAT RIGHT NOW WHICH JUST GOES TO SHOW HE'S AN EMINENTLY POLITICAL ANIMAL BUT IS POLITICS ARE ALWAYS ABOUT PLEASING WHATEVER IS THE CONSTITUENCY WREGH IN FRONT OF HIM IT'S WHY HE'S A UNION BOY NDWHEN WHEN IT COMES TO DOING THE UNIONS BIDDING TOOBIDANEIS THEIR MAN WHEN IT COMES TO THE IN MIRE MENTALIST HE IS THEIR MAN HE RESPONDS DIRECTLY TO TO INCENSIVE PRESSURE FROM THE PEOPLE HE CONSIDERS TO BE HIS MOST BASE SUPPORTERS MEANWHILE BY THE WAY HIS HEALT COUTR COST ARE CONTINUING TO RISE ACCORDING TO AXIOS WHILE CORKS IN HOW HALTHIN TRUNS PRICES OUR MEASURED EXIST AND HOW MEDICAL PROVIDER SET PRICES AND HEY'VE LED TO A DOWNTERN AN INFLATION A RESON ON THAT TREND IS NOW LIKELY TO REVERSE MEDICAL SERVICE AS ARE SIX POINT FOUR PERCENTS ABOVER ALL INFLATION BUT TWENTY SEVEN PERCENTS OF COURSE SERVICE IS EX HOUSING EXCLUDING HOUSING TO HEALTH INSURANCE IS RISING FAIRLY DRAMATICALLY AGANT A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WIT THE INFLATIONARY POLICIES THAT A PURSUED BY GOBIDON THE PRICE  MEDICAL SERVICES IS UP THE PRICE BEING TREATED HAS BEING BROUGHT HAS BEEN RISING SLOWLY ACCORDING TO THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX DATA A WHAT IS GOING WHAT WHAT WENT UP I KEEP SANGIT OVER NOR IT WI'LL COME DOWN AND I AM NOT PAYING ITTENSION ON A PERSONAL LEVEL TO THE HAPPY TALK THAT SUGGEST THAT WE ARE ALL GOING TO ESCAPE THE  THE DO MOVE THAT WE'VE CREATED FOR OURSELVES ECONOMICALLY YET EASILY OR OR QUICKLY AND JUST ONE

STILL VERY VERY MUCH IN PLAY SO IN THE BIGGEST NEWS YESTERDAY APPARENTLY SPECIAL COUNCIL DAVID WISE SAYS THAT HE INTENDS TO SEEK AN INDICTEMENT AGAINST HUNTER BIDON IN THE GUN CHARGE CASE NOW YOU REMEMBER THE HISTERY HERE BASICALLY DAVIDWISE WAS APPOINTED BY THE DEOGA HE WAS NOT GIVEN SPECIAL COUNCIL STATUS SO THAT HE COULDN'T INDEPENDENTLY GOING CHECK INTO  HUNTER BI IN'S VARIOUS FINANCIAL CRIMES WHICH IS THE STUFF WE ASTUALLY CARE ABOUT RIGHT THE GUN CHARGE STUFF IS SELATIOUS AND GOES TO THE FACT THAT HUNTER BIDIN ISOF GARBAGE BAG OF A HUMAN BEING WHO WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY HAVING AA A AN AFFAIR WITH HIS A BROTHERS WIFE HIS HIS BROTHER DID N HE WAS HAVING A FAIR WITH HIS WIFE MEANWHILE WHO'S A MASS OF DRUG ABUZER WHO IS BUYING GUNS FALSELY AND THEN TASSING THEM IN  IN THEN HIS BROTHERS WIFE TOSSMAN TRASH CAN NEAR A SCHOOL AN AL THE RESTUSS ALL THAT'S VERY SELATIOUS STUFF THAT'S NOT THE REAL PROBLEN HUNTERBIDON M PEMBING A DRUG AT IC DURELICT YAH BUT THE BIG PROBAN HUNTER BIDEN IS THAT HE WAS A BAGMAN FOR HIS AD AN EVERY ONE KNOWS THIS IN CLUDING HUNTER BIDON WHO LITERALLY TECAT HIS OWN DAUGHTER THAT HE PAYS HALF OF DAD'S BILLS IN A IN A IN A QUOTE THAT APPARENTLY IS UTTERLY UNSEEABLE TO THE MANSTREMEDIA INCLUDING PEOPLE AT THE WASHINGTON POSTS PHILIP BUM IN ANY CASE WHAT HAPPENED HERE IS THAT AS THE INVESTIGATION INS THE GUN CHARGE BEGAN AND AS THE INVESTIGATION INTO HUNTER BIDINS TAX FAILURES BEGAN BECAUSE HUNTER BIDN FAILED T PAYS TAXES FOR YEARS ON END WHILE EARNING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR FRIENDS AN FAMILY AND HIMSELF WELL ALL THAT WAS HAPPENING NOBODY WAS CHECKING INTO THE DEEPER QUESTION AS TO WHERE WAS THIS MONEY GOING WAS INFLUENCE BEING PETALLED WI FOR EXAMPLE IS HUNTER BIY NOPPING CHARGE WOTH VIOLATION OF THE FORIGN AGIENT'S REGISTRATION ACT HE CLEARLY WAS A FOREGNAGIEN HO'S OPERATING ON BEHALF OF A FOREIGN OF A FOREIGN COMPANY THAT WAS CLEARLY RELATED TO AMERICAN TO MESTIC CONCERNS I MIN BERISMI IS LIKE IT'S HARD TO SEE A BETTER CASE OF A FOREIGN AGENS THAN  HUNTER BIDIN ACTING AS A GO BETWEEN BETWEEN UCRANIAN COMPANY LIKE BERISMA AND THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT AND HO'S PRETTY OBVIOUS STUFF YOU HAVE TO RE GISTERS FORANANTION HEDN'T DO THATS THAT CANG PROSECUTOR FOR THAT SO THE QUESTION BECAME WHY WASN'T A GETTING PROSECUTOR FOR THAT SO THE ORIGINAL THEORY WAS THAT DAVID WICE EVEN IF HE HAD WANTED TWHO COULDN'T BECAUSE THE DO JA UNDER JOBIDON DIDN'T GIVE HIM SPECIAL COUNCIL STATUSTACTALLY PURSUE THAT AND NOW IS THE CASE THOT WAS BEING MADE BY IRUS WHISTLE BLOWERS LIKE EVRY SCHAPLY WHO AS SANG A YAD DEY OULD WIS TOLD US HE COULDN'T ASK ABOUT JO EVERY AVENUE INTO INVESTIGATION REGARDING THE HUNTER JOE CONNECTION WAS SHUT DOWN BY DAVID WICE AND BY HIS TEAM AT THE DO JAY AND THEN THEY TRIED TO BRING IN FRONT OF A JODGE A SWEETHEART DEAL FOR HUNTER BIDON JUST TO RECAP THE HISTORY HERE THE SWEETHART DEAL WAS THAT HE WOULD PLEAD GUILTY ON SOME TAX CHARGE AS YOU GET NO JAIL TIME AND ON THE GUN CHARGE HE WOULD BE GIVEN A  DIVERSION INSTEAD OF INACTUAL CONVICTION ON HIS RECORD BUT BURIED IN THE GUN CHARGE WAS IMMUNITY FOR ALL FURTHER PROSECUTION ON THINGS LIKE FOR AN ACENT'S REGISTRATION ACT VIOLATIONS HAT WAS BURIEDIN THE GUN CHARGE THE JUDGE LOOK TO THE I'VE NEVER SEEN A DEAL REMOTELY LIKE THIS WHY ARE YOU IMMUNIZING HIM FROM FURTHER PROSECUTION OR INVESTIGATION ON FINANCIAL CRIMES IN THE GUN CHARGE YOU'RE DOING THIS TO HIDE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS AND THEN SHED BLEWED UP AN OPEN COURT AND THE DEOJA DENIED THAT WAS GO  WHAT WAS GOING ON AND HUNTER BINS LETTERS LIKE WELE THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT WAS OING ON SO WE DON'T HAVE A DEAL AFTER THAT THE BITE ADMINISTRATION KNEW THAT WHAT IT HAD ON HITS HANDS WAS A PRETTY OBVIOUS CANDAL IN WHICH THE DEOJA HAD ESSENTIALLY MASSAGE THIS ENTIRE PROCESS S THAT HUNTER BITDIN WOULD NEVER BE INVESTIGATED FOR HIS INVOLVEMENT WITH HIS DAD AND SO THAT'S WHEN MERICARLING CAM OUNT N SAID O KAN'TYOU KNOW WHAT WOREGAN TO MAKE GIVID WEST SPECIAL COUNCILS THEY DID IT TOO LATE THEY GIVE HIM SPECIAL COUNCIL STATS NOWN THAT ALLSO CAME JUST IN TIME FOR DAVID WICE DO NOT TESTIFIN FROM CONGRESS ABOUT ALL THIS TBECAUSE ONCE WHO'S GIVEN SPECIAL COUNCIL STATUS THEN HOW CAN HE BE ASKED ABOUT FAILURE TO BE GIVEN SPECIAL COUNCIL STATUS AGAN SIMPLY SILIZEN THERE'S AN ON GOING INVESTIGATION I CAN'T COMMENT AND ON GOING INVESTIGATIONS OR NEGOTIATIONS SO WHO'S ALL VERY CONVENIENT IT WS ALL VERY OBVIOUSLY A COVER UP AND NOW HE COME TO THE FINAL PART OF WHAT IS THE COVER UP YOU OMAGION AND THAT IS DAVID WISE SEEKING CHARGE IS ON THE GUN CHARGES BY THE END OF MONTH ACGORDING THE SEANNEN  HUNTER BITON HAD PREVIOUSLY REACH TO DEAL INVOLVING A FELLONY GUN POSSESSION CHARGE THAT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED HIM TO AVOID PROSECUTION IF HE MENT CERTAIN CONDITIONS OVER A TWENTY FOUR MONTH PERION ACCORDING TO TH SPECIAL COUNCIL'S OFFICE THE SPEEDY TRIAL ACT REQUIRES THE OVERMENT OBTAIN THE THE RETURN OF AN INDIGTMEN BY GRANJERY BY FRIDAY SOPTEMBER TWENTY NINTH TWENTY TWENTY THREE AT THE EARLIEST PROSECUTORS DID NOT SAY HOW MANY CHARGES WOULD ACTUALLY BE BROUGHT AGAIN THERE IS FEDERAL CRIME RELATED TO THE GUN STUFF HERE BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT THIS ABOUT THE REAL QUESTION IS IS THIS DEAL NOW IS THIS GUN CHARGE  NOW GOING TO INCLUD A PLEAD DEAL THAN IMUNIZE HIM FROM FURTHER INVESTIGATION OR IS DAVID WI DIS CAN SAY HEYWARE DUN HERE AND MOVE ON AND THERE WON'T BE ANY INVESTIGATION INS THE FINANCES OF JOE AND HUNTER BIDON WEGET HIM MORE ON THIS MOMENTARILY FIRST MY TEAM IS CONSTANTLY TALKINGABOUT DELICIOUS ALL AMERICAN MET YOUKNOW WHY BECAUSIS AMAZING YOU

MONTH THAT TRIAL IS NOW AN ORDER ON THE TAXOFFENCES AND YOU MIGHT BRING IT TITIONAL TAX CHARGES IN CALIFORNIA OR WASHINGTON D C BUT ALL OF THAT IS ARRELEVANT TO THE BROUGHTER QUESTION OF F OU'RECARGING WITH TAX CRIMES MAYBE OU OUGHT TO INVESTIGATE FULLY WHERE TE MONEY WAS COMING FOMING WHERE THE MONEY WAS GOING LI THIS IS VERY VERY BASIC STUFF HERE AN IF THEY DON'T PURSUE THAT IT'S PRETY OVIOUS WHY THEY ARE NOT PURSUING THAT AND SIMPLY SAYING THT HE CHARGING WITH THE GUN CRIME IN ORDER TO PRESUMABLY COVER FOR NOT INVESTIGATING THE THINGTHAT EVERYONE CARES ABOUT IT THAT SORT OF LIKE IF THEY DECIDED TO PROSECUTE ALCOPONE ON THE TAX CRIME NOT BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO PUT HIM IN JAIL BUT TO IMMUNIZE HIM FROM FURTHER PROSECUTION ON YOU KNO MURDER THAT'S IT THAT'S SSENTIALLY ALY

HE COME TO THE LEGACY MEDIA WHEN IT COMES T THE LEGACY MEDIA THIS IS WHAT THEY DO THEY SIMPLY DECIDE THROUGH SELECTION BY US WHAT'S TO COVER AND WHAT NOT'STO COVER WHAT IS A STORY AND WHAT IS NOT A STORY SO BIG HUBUB ON AX FORMERLY NON ACE TWITTER LAST NIGHT BECAUS TUCKER CARLSON INTERVIEWED A MAN NAMED LARRY SIN CLARE SO LARRYSON CLARE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE YOU NOW BEEN ON THE INTRINETE ANY TIME IN THE LAST FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS LARRYSON CLAIRE IS A A MAN WHO ALLEGE IS THAT AT HE HAD A COCANE FUELD SEX BINGE WITH BROKOBAMA BACK IN BROKOBAMAS STATE HOUSE DAYS IN ILLINOIS NOW THAT'S NOT UNCREDIBLE IT ISN'T BROKOBONT IN HIS OWN MEMOIRS TALKS ABOUT HOW HE THE  BLO SO CLEARLY THE GOTSFAMILIAR DRUGS BROKOBAMA WROTE TO A GIRL FRIEND WE NOW KNOW THAT HE REGULARLY LIKE EVERY DAY HAD FANCIES ABOUT HAVING SEX OF MEN IF THAT IS NOT CONJECTURE THAT IS SOMETHING THE BROKOBAMA WROTE IN HIS OWN HAND TO A GROLL FRIEND WHICH BY THE WYS A WEIRD THING TO SAD YOUR GROFAN ANY CASE IT'S NOT A NONCREDIBLE STORY SO THE MEDIA AT THE TIME WHEN AFTER LARRIS AN CLARE THEY POINTED OUT THAT HE HAD A HISTORY OF CRIMINALITY BACK IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND THE THEY JUST IGNORED THE STORY NOW LETME POINT OUT THAT IF BAROKOBAM HAD BEN REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR OFFICE THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN FROM PAGE STORY ALL THE TIME THERE'S NO QUESTION HIS PERSONWOULAV BEN ON EVERY HE TESHO THERE'S NO QUESTION THIS PERSON WOUL HAV BEE ON MEET THE PRESS THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THIS'S PERSON WOULDHAV BEEN TREATED AS A FULLY LEGITIMATE POSSIBLE NEW SOURCE THIS IS NO QUESTION SO HERE WAS LARISIN CLARHO ADMITTEDLY IS A WILD DUED ANMN IT TURNS OUT THE PEOPLE WHO ENGAGE IN A COKINE FEELD SEX ORGIES  AR TYPICALLY KIND OF WHILE BUT HERE IS HERE IS LARRIS IN CLAR TALKING ABOUT HIS ENCOUNTS WITH BAROKOBMAMA AND I'M SWONDERING WHY IS THIS WHAT WHAT MAKES HIM SPECIFICALLY NONCREDIBLE SO NONCREDIBLE THAT NO ONE WILL COVER HIM EXCEPT FOR IF HE GOES ON TUCKER I GOT DOP OFF THEY LAFT  THE NEXT DAY WAS SOMEWHAT INTERESTING BECAUSE HE ENS UP SHAING UP AT MY HOTORA WHICH I THOUGHT WAS SOMEWHAT WEIRD BUT HE WANTED SOME WORE SO WHEN YOU THINK HE SHOWED UP HET HE SHOWED A IMAN I HAD NO WANING I WAS E TRON THERE'S A NOCK ON THE DOOR I OPEN THE DOOR AND HE STANDING THAT ANH STANDING THERE WAS MARE CO ANY COMES AND AND IT WAS JUST LIKE A QUICK YOU KNOW REHO SHA RE RON FROM THE NIGHT BEFOR EXACT ING PROGRAMM EXACT TINT PROGRAMS HE SMOKING AGAIN SO BROKABON THE SMOKES CRACK AND THEN YOU PERFORMED THE ELT SECTS ON HIM IGAT SO HERE IS THE QUESTION THE QUESTION IS WHY PRECISELY IS LERIS AN CLAR SIGNIFICANTLY LESS CREDIBLE THEN SAY EACHING CAROL REAL QUESTION WHY IS IT THAT EVERY TIME SOMEBODY MAKES AN ACCUSATION AGAINST A DEMOCRAN OF OF BEHAVIOUR LIKE THIS SUDDENLY THE MEDIA GO COMPLETELY RADIO SILENT WHEN SO N MAKES AN ALLIGATION ABOUT JOBIDON THAT TOURBIN PUSHED HER AGAINST A WALL AND THRUST HIS FINGERS INTO HER THAT IS TREATED AS ABSOLUTELY NON CREDIBLE WE WILL WILL PAY LITTLE BIT OF ATTENTION JUST FOR CEND OF THE SAKE OF SAYING THAT WE DID BY WHAT WERE NOT GOING DO I TAKE THAT SUPERSERIOUSLY BUT BUT IF ANYBODY ACCUSED NONAL TRUMP OF A THING THEN OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT SUPERDUPERJUPERSERIOUSLY I THAT THAT THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT SO HERE IS THE THING AGAIN THERE ISIN CLARIS ALLIGATION WHICH ISTHT HE WAS IN CHICAGO TO PARTICULAR TIME YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHECK THE RECORDS IS TO WHETHER HE WAS IN  CHICAGO AT A PARTICULAR TIME A JOURNALIST SHOULD BEABLE TO ASK LARISIN CLARER THERE ANY DISTINGUISHING FEATURES ABOUT BAROKOBAMA THAT WOULD CONFIRM YOUR STORY ONE O THE THINGSTHAT LARISN CLAR SAYS IN THIS INTERVIEW WITH TUCKER CARLSIN IS THAT BAROKOBONA HAD TOLD HIM AT THE TIME IS NINETY NINE THAT HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE IN IS MARRIAGE AND WHEN LERIS IN CLAR RIGINALLY SAID THAT THERE R LOT OF PEOPLELIN NO THAT'S A WY WHAT HOW DARE YOU THEY'VE A PERFECT WHAT ET CAME OUT IN MICHEL UBON HIS MEMOIR THAT YATHEY WERE ACTUALLY HAVING SOME PRE SIGNIFICANT MARITAL TROUBLES AT THAT TIME SO THE TIME LINE LINES UP WITH ALL THIS AND AGAIN IT IS NOT A WILD ALLIGATION TO SUGGEST THE BAROKOBAMA MA'VE ENGAGED IN HOMOSECUAL BEHAVIOR CONSIDERING HE LITERALLY WROTE IN A LETTER THAT HE FANCISIZED ABOUT DOING SO IT'S NOT A WILD ALIGATION IS SUGGEST TE BROKABAM MAY BEEN DOING COKE IN THE LATE NINETIES CONSIDERING THAT HE LITERALLY WROTEIN HIS MEMOIRSABOUT DOING COT AND THIS IS NOT SOMEBODY WHO HAS MAINTAINED IN HIS OWN HAND THAT HE IS STRAIGHT AS THE AS AS STRAIGHT CAN BE WHEN IT COMES TO HIS SEXUAL PROCLIVITIES AND NO DRUG USE LIGNIT AGAINST THAT MEA THAT WHAT LARY SAINT CLARA SAYING IS ABSOLUTE TRUE I HAVE NO IDEA YOURN'T HAVE AN IDEA BUT AGAN WERE ASKED TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS ALL THE TIME IN THE UORTER PUBLIC OPINION ABOUT WHO IS QUOTICUA CREDIBLE AND WHO IS NOT CREDIBLE REMEMBER WE WERE TOLD BY THE ENTIRER MAINSTREMEDIA THAT CHRISTINE BLAZY FORD WHO ACCUSED JUST AS BRADCHAVINA OF HAVING GANG RAPED HER BACK IN THEIR TEAN AGE DAYS SHE WAS BROUGHT BEFORE CONGRESS COMELLA HARRIS ASKED HER QUESTIONS SHE'S ON THE COVER OF TIME MAGAZINE SHE BECAME THE LEADING FACE OF ME TOO AND HER ALLEGATIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS CREDIBLE THAN LATRIS AND CLARS HER ALLEGATIONS HAD NO CONFIRMING DETAILS THEY DID NOT MATCH WITHTHE BEHAVIOR THAT WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT FROM BRAD CAVINOT IN TERMS OF LIKE HIS SEXUAL LIFE STYLE THEY'RE NO CONFIRMATORY SORT OF DETAILS LIKE NONE PLACE TIME ANYONE ELSE WHO CAN REMEMBER THIS VENT LIKET AND AND YET THAT WAS TREATED AS AS PERFECT EVIDENCE THAT BRECKCAVINAL SHOULD NOT SIT ON THE BENCH AND IN FACT IF YOU CONFIRMED HIM TO SIT ON THE SUPREME QUORT OF THE UNITED STATES THIS MEANT THT YOU WERE FINE WITH GOING AHEAD WITH WITH WITH RAPE THE FACT THAT THAT AGAIN LERYSON CLAIR HAS BEEN ROUND FOR A WHILE THESE ALLEGATIONS WERE BEING TRAFFICS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SAVEIN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AS EARLY AS THAD AND THEY'E BEEN WIDESPREAD ALLEGATIONS ABOUT BEROCKUMOMA SEXUAL BEHAVIOR BACK IN HIN CHICAGO DAYS FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME I DON'T KNOW IF THEIR TRUE I DON'T YOU DON'T KNOTT THEIR TRUE BUT THE POINT IS THAT THE MEDIA HAVE A HAVE A CERTAIN STANDARD AS TO WHAT IS A CREDIBLE ALLIGATION ANDTHER STANDARD ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE YOU'RE MAKING IT AGAINST HEREPUBLICAN THAT SEEMS TO BE THE STANDARD IF YOU'RE MAKING AN ALLEGATION AGAINST HER PUBLICANTED HIS IMMEDIATELY DEEMS CREDIBLE WHICH IS PRESUMABLY WHY WERSTILL TIKE OUT EGNG CAROLL REMMER EGIN CARROLL IS IM HAS BEEN HELD TWO TO HA I SHE SUED DONAL TRUMP IN FEDERAL COURT FOR DEFAMATION AND SHE AN AY JUDGMENT FROM HIM BECAUSE HE SAID THAT SHE'S A CRAZY PERSONAN HE DIDN'T RAPE HER REMEMBER HER ALLIGATION IS THAT DONALD TRUMP RAPED HER AN A MANHADNT DEPARTMENT STORE ROOM AT THE  INDRESSING WOM AT BURG DWARF GOODMEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY AND SHE'S AND SHE SHE'S WRITTEN ABOUT IT LIKE PUBLICLY SAYING THAT SHE DIDN'T CONSIDERED AR RAPE AT THE TIME AND ONLY LATER DID SHE SART TO THING MAYBE IT WAS BAD LA IT'S HER I GOT AS A HER ALLEGATIONS I DON'T YOU BY THEIR WILDLY MORE CREDIBLE THAN LATRIS AN CLARIS ALLIGATIONS WHY WELL NOW IT TURNS OUT THAT A FEDERAL JUDGE HIS RULE THE DONAL TRUMP IS LIBLE A SECOND TIME FOR TO FAMING HER THIS TIME OVER TO SPARIGEON COMMENT HE MADE IN TWENTY NINETEEN AFTER SHE ACCUSED HIM OF SEXUALLY ASSAULTING HER AN TAE MAN HAN N DEPARTMENT STORE YOUS DISTRICT JODGE AT LOUIS CAPLIN IN NEW YORK SAIT A COMING TRIAL WOULD BE LIMITED TO DETERMINING HOW MUCH TRUMP MUST PAIN INDAMAGES TO CARROLL WHO BROUGHT TWO LOSSETS AGAINST HIM IN THE SPRING THEY GAVE CAROLL FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AN DAMAGENTS AFTER FINDING TRUMPET LIBLE FOR SEXUALLY ABUSIG HER AND LADER TO FAMING HER AND A SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO THE EARLIER JURY BY THE WAY DIDN'T FIND THAT HE COMITTED RAPE BUT FOUND MORE LIKELY THAN THAT

HOW'LL SEE CRAZINESS OF THE DAY MILITARY LEADERS I HAVE SAE THE WEAPONISATION OF THE MILITARY OND BEHALF OF THE LEFT IS TOTALLY INSAN TO ME IT'S TOTALLY CRAZY THE FACT THAT THE UPPER ASHLONS OF MILITARY HAVE DECIDED THEY'RE GOING TO ECHO EVERY NOSTRUM OF THE LEFT IS THE DUMBEST THING IN THE WORLD YOU ON'T TALK ABOUT THINGS THET'RE DRIVING AWAY RECRUITS HOW ABOUT THE REAL ORNIENTATION OF THE MILITARY AWAY FROM BRAK THINGS KILL PEOPLE WIN WARS TORD FIND YOUR INDIVIDUAL SELF EXPRESSION HERE IN THE MILITARY THAT'S THAT SUCH A WEIRD MOVE IT'S SO WEIRD AND TH DEMOCRETS ARE CLEARLY USING THE MILITARY FOR THESE PURPOSES WHICH IS PRESUMABLY WHY THEY'RE SO INSISTENT THEY'RE ALL FIRED INSISTENT THAT THE MILITARY IS GOING TO PAY THE BILLS OF PEOPLE WHO WISH TO LEAVE IN ANTI ABORTION STATE TO GO TO A PRO ABORTION STATE TO HAVE THEIRABORTIONS A T TH THAT IS THE THAT IS THE CURRENT POLICY STATEMENT OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARES WHUT DEMOCRATS WANT TO DO THERE 'S A STAND OFF RIGHT NOW BETWEEN TOMMY TUBBERVILLE WHOS SENATOR FROM ALABAMA HEU OPPOSES THE PENS GUNS CURAN POLICY OF REIMBURSING SERVICE MEMBERS IN THEIR FAMILIES WHO HAVE TO TRAVEL TO RECEIVE ABORTION IN THE SENATE ONE SENATOR CAN HOLD UP NOMINATIONS OR A LEGISLATION ACCGORING TO SE AN END TUBERVILLE STANDS HAS LEFT THREE  MILITARY SERVICES TO OPERAT WITHOUT A SENATE CONTROL LEADER  SENT AT CON FIRM LEADER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY NOW HERE'S THE THING IF THEY WANT THESE LEADERS CONFIRMED ALL DEMOCRATS HAVE TO DOS BING THEM UP ONE BY ONE THAT'S ALL THEY HAVE TO DO RIGHT THAT IF THEY BRING UN ONE BY ONES WHO GIVE US AN UPRIGHT DOWNBVER ON THIS NOMINY TUBERVILTE IS NOT HOLDING UP THE NOMINYE HE'S HOLDING UP THE UNANIMOUS CONSENT YOURN'T HAVE TO HAVE UNANIMOUS CONSENT DEMOCRATS CONTROL THE SENATE PLUSS HAFE THE REPUBLICANS ORE GEN AVOTE FOR TESE PEOPLE BUT SENANT DEMOCRATS KEEP SAYING THT IT WILL TAKE UP VALUABLE FLOR TIME WHICH THEY LI WHAT VALUABLE FLORT WHAT E GATES DOING FOR A LIVINGYET OF FIVE WEEK RECESS IN AUGUST THE WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY THEN TRYING TO TURN ABORTION INTO A POLITICAL ISSUE VIEW THE MILITARY AN THE MILITARY WILL PAY FOR YOU TO GO GET YOUR ABORTION IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU ARE IF YOU ARE IN TAXAS AND TUBBERVILLES LIKE NO I'M PUTTNG A BLANK GET HOLD ON UNANIMOUS I'M NOT DOING YOUR UNANIMOUS CONSENT CRAPINSLY TRIP THAT TAXPARS SHOULD NOT BE PAYING FOR

DEMOCRATS ALIKE WELL THEN WE WILL JUST YOU KNOW NOT HAVE LEADERS FOR U MILITARY AND THEN THEY BLAME TUBBERVILLE FOR IT AND THEY MILITORIZE THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP TO DO THE SAME THING SO THE ACTING SECRETARY OF THE NAVY CARLOSTALL TRO IS NOW ACCUSING REPUBLICANS OF EATING AND A BEDDING OUR ENEMIES BY NOT SIMPLY BLANKET CONFIRMING A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WILE ALLOWING THE ILITARY TO PAY FOR ABORTIONS I TAKE SOIR CONFRGI  ON IIN CONI COUNTRY AVE NEVERTACT IN THACTRY ONE ROUND SENATORS WE'LD ACTUALLY BE AITING IN A BEDDING COMMINES AND O THEIR AUTOCRATIC REGINES AROUND THE WORLD THIS IS HAVING A REAL

SENTIN PART THIS IS TWO WEEKS AGO I WILL CONTINUE THIS PROCESS OF OVERSIGHT AND I WILL ANNOUNCE MY OPPOSITION TO SPECIFIC NOTMANESE WEEN THIS IS THIS IS ABSURD IS ABSURD AMIY USING THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY IS A STAND IN FOR ABORTION AND THEN AGAIN YOU WONDER WHY PEOPLE OGAT FACT A DIST PROPORTIONATE UMBER OF RECRUITS IN TH MILITARY COME FROM THE SOUTH FACT IT DUST PROPORTIONATE NEMBERS NUMBER OF MEMBERS THE MILITARY ARE CONSERVATIVE FACT IT DUST PROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF MEMBERS THE MILITARY ARE CHILDREN OF MILITARY NUMBERS OR RELITIVES OF MILITARY MEMBERS YOU WANT TO GO DIRECTLY AT THOSE PEOPLE BY TURNING THE THE MILITARY INTO THE LEADING POINT OF THE SPEURE ONE IT COMES TO ABORTION POLIC ABSOLUTE NUTTINESS BUT AGAIN ITS SOCIAL POLICY UBER ALICE FOR THIS S AD MINISTRATION THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT MILITARY READINESS AND THEN TRYING TO CLAM REPUBLICANSO CLAR CARE ABOUT MILTER REDNES WHEN THEY CAN SIMPLY JUST BRING THESE PEOPLE UP INDIVIDUALLY FOR A VOTE IS TOTALLY INSANE IT'S TOTALLY TOTALLY CRAZY IT'S IN IN BY THE WAY TERRIBLE FORE THE CUNTRY OKIN TIME FOR A THING THAT I LIKE SO AS YOU KNOW CONVICTING A MURDER WHICH IS CANDIS OWNS IS NEW SERIES ABOUT THE SEVIN EVERY CASE THAT IS GOING TO BE AVAILABLE TO MO THE FIRST T EPISODE WILL BE COMING OUT TOMORROW FOR EVERY ONE AND THEN YOU'LL HAV TO TO DAILYWHERE PLUS OS SUBSCRIBED FOR THE REST BUT IF YOU SUBSCRIBE RIT NOW FOR A DAILY WORE PLAS THEN YOUW'LL ALSO BE ABLE TO ACCUS THE FIRST THREE EPISODES RIGHT NOW BEFORE ANY ONE ELSELY TODAY WELL WE DIDN'T INTERVIEW WITH CANDISO BIT EARLIER THIS WEEK I'M CONVICTING MURDERITURS WOT SOUNDED LIKE JOINING US ON LINE IS TH PERSONWHO NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION THT A COURSE IS CANDAS OWENS T'L GIVE FER AN INTRODUCTION ANYWATIONS IN YOUR TIMES BEST SELLING AUTHOR THE FOUNDER OF BLUXSIT AND THE HOST OF CANDISTONS OVER ON DAILY WHARE PLUSON NOWSHAS OF FASCINATING NEW DOCKYOU SERIES THAT IS OUT IT IS CALLED CONVICTING A MURDERER AND IT TAKES ON THE NONSENSE THAT WAS PRESENTED BY NATFLICES MAKING A MURDERER WHICH WAS BASICALLYES SUGGESTION THAT A PERSON  CONVICTED OF MURDER RIGINALLY DIDN'TCOMMIT THE MURDER ATUALLY HE WAS INNOCENT 'LTHEY LEFT OUT A LOT OF EVIDENCE IND CANDIS ON COVERS ALL OF THE CANDAS THANKS RE DROYING CHOW CONGRATULATIONS ON THE SERIES THANK YOU IT'S GONO BI THINK OUR FIRST DOC YOU SERIES THE DAILY WIRE WHICH IS PRETTY EXCITING RIGHT TEN APISESAN THS FOR SOMMING DONE THAT THAT'S RIGHT IN IT LOOKS FAN TASTIC SO WHY DON'T YOU TALK ABOUT FIRST OF ALL WHAT LED YOU TO WANT TO YOU HONE IN ON THIS STORY YGET A LOT STORIES TOT COME ACROSS YOUR DUSK BUT THIS IS THE ONE THAT REALLY DROVE YOU ENOUGH TO ONE TO MAKE A FULL ON TOCKU SERIES ABOUT IT YI GANOW I THINK I IE DEMONSTRATED JUS IN GENERAL INTEREST AND MEDIA PER CEPTION AND I THINK IT'S FASTINTING ITS A STUDY IN HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY AND WE CAN OPERATEN WERE ABOV IT BUT WE'VE ALL BEEN SUBJECTED TO BRAIN WASH IN THE FUTURE WERE ALL GOING TO YOU KNOW TO PASIN BECOME BIC TO MISE BY MEDIA PROPAGANDA AND BRAIN WASH IN TE FUTURE NONE OF US AGAN ARE ABOVE IT AND IM SO YOU GO FROM GREATEST LIE OF OER SOLE FOCUSSING ON MA GEORGE FLOD STORY WHICH REALLY WAS A PSYCHOLOGICAL PHENOMENON EVERYONE GENUINELY BELIEVED THIS MAN WAS INNOCENT IT WAS KILLED WITH THE HANS OF POLICE AND IT'S IT'S REALLY AN NOT EXACT SAME VAIN EXCEPT WITH GEORGE FLOOD YOU HAD BLACK LIVES MATER WHICH STEVEN AVERY OU SORT OF HOF WHITE LIVE'S MATTER WHERE THERE WAS JUST REALLY THIS ANTY POLICE SANTOMEN WHICH I THINK THE MEDIA WAS SEIZING UPON AND NAPFLIC JUST RIGPT PLACE RIGHT TIME RACING NIZED A STORY THAT WAS IN FACT INTERESTING YOU HAD A MAN SEPEN AVERY WHO WAS PUT IN PRISON WRONGFULLY CONVICTED THE FIRST TIME PUT INTO PRISON FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS FOR A CRIME HE DID NOT COMMIT A WHICH WAS A THE RAPE AND ATTEMPTED MURDER OF ANOTHER WOMAN WHO WRONGLY POINTED HIM OUT IN A LINE UP AND SO I THINK PEOPLE WANTED TO BELIEVE THAT WILL MA ME TH THE JUST ISTEN GOT AT WRONG TWICE AND TAT WHEN HE WAS WALKING FREE AND GOT CON YOU KNOW GOT ACCUSE OF ANOTHER MURDER THEY NEEDED TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS JUST COMPLETELY WRONG MISS MANNIS IN O SEND EVEN IN THE FACE OF OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE AND THAN YOU HAD TWO DOCUMENTARY MAKERS TO A LIBERAL WOMEN LESBEENS FROM NEW YORK WHO WENT DOWN THERE IN TO SITED THIS IS IT FOR GEN TO BRING THIS TO NAPLUXS TO SUPERINTERESTIN NG STORY AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS OMIT DETAILS VERY NECESSARY DETAILS LIKE WHOM SIMILAR TO GEORGE FLOID HAAD THREE TIMES LEVEL OF FENTIONAL IN A SISTEM THAT COULD A POSSIBLY KILLED A HORSE MAY BE RELOVIN BUT LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE'RE INSISTING ON A DIFFERENT NARRATIVE VERY SIMILAR ASPECTS AND THAT'S DEFINITELY WHAT DREW ME TO THIS PARTICULAR STORY SO A TON OF PEOPLE WATCH TO MAKE A MURDER WAS CEN OM OA PHENOMENON WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT BUT FOR THOSE WHO WHO DIDN'T WATCH IT CAN GIVEN SORT OF BARE BONES OUTLINE OF WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED THAT LED TO THE THE ORIGINAL CONVICTION OF STEPHEN AVORY YOU MENTION HE HAD ONE CASION AN WHO'S RELEASED AFTER THAT CASEON THA WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN THE TERESA HALLBACK MURDER IT INSTANTLY BECAME O CULT OF MAKING A MURDERER OF THE THE FIRST EPISODE KIND OF OPENS UP AND YOU SEE THIS GUY AND HE SEEMS LOVING HE SEEMS SFAMILY ORIENTED HE'S BEING RELEASED FROM PRISON I MEAN ALL OF US ARE DRAWN TO A STORY OF A WRONGFUL CONVICTION THAT CONCEPT OF BEING PUT AWAY IN PRISONE TING THT YOU DIDN'T DO IT'S EOU'R INSTANTLY GOING ALL MY OCHES IS FASCINATING AND THEN AT THE END OF THE EPISODE AFTER THEY MAKE YOU THINK THIS IS IS LOVING FAMILY MAN AND HE'S ALSO INCREDIBLY FORGIVING HE'S LIKE YOU KNOW WRONG PLACE WRONG TIME THE REASON WHY HE GOT WRONGFULLY CONVICTED WAS BECAUSE THE WOMAN GENUINELY AND SHE WAS TOTALLY BEAT UP ABOUT IT GENUINELY THOUGHT THAT SHE RECOGNIZED THIS PERSON THAT HAD RAPE TERN LEFT HER FOR DEAD AND THIS WAS BEFORE WE HAD TEAN A EVIDENCE RIGHT AND SO THEY THEY SET THIS UP PERFECTLY AND THAT THE END THEY DROP A BOB ON YOU Y THE FIRST EPISONE N THEY LET YOU KNOW A ACTUALLY HE'S BEEN ARRESTED AGAIN AND HE'S BEING ACCUSED OF ANOTHER MURDER AR DUN'T UNDONE AND SO THIS IS KIND OF WHAT DREW EVERYBODY AND THAT'S THE INITIAL STEPHEN ABERY STORY AND THEND THEY WENT THROUGH AN UNPACKED AND VERY HEAVILY SUGGESTED IN MY OPINION A THAT STEPHEN AVERY WAS INNOCENT AND THEN OF COURSE YOU HAD THAND THE CHORUS OF CELEBRITIES FOR WHATEVER REASON ALIC BALDWIN IS ALWAYS RIGHT IN THE THICK OF IT ELIC  THIS IS AN UNJUST TIS THIS IS COMPLETELY WRONG THIS MAN JUS CANNOT STAY OUT OF IT YOU HAD CELEBRITIES THAT WERE TWETING ABOUT THI SERIES IT WHEN ABSOLUTELY VIRAL AND AGAIN IT WAS JUST SORT OF THIS CULTURAL MOMEN WHERE PEOPLE WE'RE DEVELOPING THIS ANTYE POLICE SENTIMENT SO IN YOUR SERIES CONVICTING A MURDER WHICH AGAIN IS FASTAM NI CAN ASK YOU TO GIVE WAY ALL THE DETAILS O IN A WAT THERE'S A WAT IN THERE THAT THE PEOPLE JUST T DON'T KNOW THAT WAS DIRECTLY OVERLOOKED OR OR ACTUALLY DOCTOR BY THE ORIGINAL MAKIN A MURDER DOCUMENTARIANS CAN GIVE US JUST A TASTE OF  SORT OF THE THE SUFFIT ITHER WASN'T PRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC IN  MAKING A MURDER OR WAS ACTIVELY CHANGE I MEYOU MAKE HIM ACCUSATIONS IN CONVICTING A MURDER THAT THAT IARE NOT ACCUSATIONS MEEN THERE JUST REALITIES TH THE FOR EXAMPLE KEE FACTS WORD DELIBERATELY OMITTED CUT AROUND THAT SORT OF THIN SO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY WERE REALLY REALLY AND OT THESE TO DOCUMENTARY MAKERS WAS DECEPTIVE EDITING I THINK WOULD BE THE RIGHT TERM WHICH IS TO SAY THAT EVEN IF THEY'RE SHOWING YOU PORT PARTS OF THE CORT TESTIMONY YOU'RE THINKING THAT YOURE WATCHING A PERSON WERE SPOND LIKE THERE'S A MOMEN WHETHER THERE'S THERE SITTING IN THE CORT ROOM AND THE POLICE OPSTIGETES ASKED TO QUESTION AND THEY SHOW YOU THAT HE GETS SORT OF TITE IT LOOKS LIKE HIS LYING RIGHTS YOU HAVE ALWAYS COME TORS LIKE WHAT'T YOU SEO SEE IS REACTION WAS ASKED THAT QUESTION WELL REALITY THAT WASN'T EVEN THAT HIS RESPONSE O THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION THEY JUST SEE YOU WHOSE HIM SITTING UP AT A DIFFERENT MOMENT AND PUT IT NEXT TO A QUESTION THAT HE WAS ASKE AT A DIFFERENT TIME SO IS A SORT OF THESE DECEPTIVE ADITING TRICKS TO HEAVILY SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE WERE EITHER INNOCENT OR PEOPLE WERE GUILTY AND A I THINK PROBABLY WHAT PEOPLE ARE MOST INTERESTED AND BACK AT HOME AND STILL TO THIS DAY IS PEOPLE WHO SAY I DO THINK SEE NAVY WAS GUILTY BUT I BELIEVE THAT HIS NEPHEW WAS SOMEWHAT MANIPULATED I THINK THAT WILL PROBABLY BE THE MOST FASCINATING ELEMENT FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE WILLING TO HAVE THE HUMILITY TO EXPLORE HOW PERHAPS THEY WERE DUPES LIKE I SAID WE WE'VE ALL BEEN THEREBEFORE IF YOU FOUND ME TEN YEARS AGO I WAS A LEFT LEANING A A O YOUNG WOMAN WHO THOUGHT THAT ABORTION WAS ARIGHT YOU KNOW WE WE CHANGE YOU KNOW AND IF YOU'RE WILLING TO GO THROUGH THAT YOU WILL LEARN THAT EVEN WITH BREDANDACY PEOPLE WE'RE LED TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS INNOCENT ELEGIBLY THAT HE WAS STUPIDLETO BELY THAT HE WAS MANIPULATED AND I BELIEVE THAT HE WAS MANIPULATED BUT IT WASN'T FROM THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HEAVILY SUGGESTED BY MAKING A MURDERER HE WASN'T MANIPULATED A BY ANYBODY FOR IN MY OPINION OTHER THAN THE DOCUMENTARY MAKERS AND HIS OWN UNCLE SO CAND IS WHAT YOU FOR SEE AS THE REACTION TO YOUR KNEW SERIES DO YOU DO YOU THINK THAT NG ANY RESPONSE FROM THE AVERY FAMILY FROM THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTERIANS WHAT YOU FORESEE ER WELL WE HAVE A BERY'S FAMILY IN THE DOCUMENT AR A SO THATS REALLY INCREDIBLE TO ACTUALLY HERE FROM HIS BROTHER TO BE ABLE TO ASK THEM THOSE POINTED QUESTIONS DO YOU ACTUALLY THINK HE WAS GUILTY WHICH IS INTERESTING YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION IS THAT THE ENTIRE AVORYCLAN IS BEHIND HIM THE ENTIRE ARY CLAN LOVES HIM AND I THINK THAT WE WILL EXPOSE THOSE ELEMENTS AS BEING FALSE BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT THE ORLY RECEPTION HAS BEEN PEOPLE JUST KNOWING THAT WE'RE DOING THIS IN SEEING THE TRAILER I'VE HAD SO MANY S THAT ERE ANGRY I SAY CANT IS JUST SAY OUT OF THIS WHEN I LOVE YOU SO MUCH BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ALL THE FACTS WE'VE BEEN RESEARCHING FOR YEARS WERE ON RUDAN THREAD AND I LOVE THAT I LOVED THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S MINDS AND I THINK THAT AFTERWARD AGAIN IF YOU ARE A PERSON THAT IS WILLING TO EXERCISE THAT HUMILITY OR JUST CAN A GO WOW IT'S INCREDIBLE AND YOU'LL PROBABLY NOT DOUBT YOURSELF BUT YOU' WOU'LL GROW FROM THE EXPERIENCE NONE OF US ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT CERTAINLY NOT ME WELL THAT'S CANDI TO OWEN'S GO CHECK OUT HER BRAND NEW DOC YOU SERIOES CONVICTING A

HUCKABY HE SAYING THE SAME THING IF THE DEMOCRAT WIND THE COUNTRY IS BASICALLY FINISHED AGAIN I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IS THE CASE BECAUSE I'VE I BELIEVE THAT THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE UNITED STATES AS AS WEAK AS THEY HAVE BEEN INTROMS O PUBLIC OPINION OUR LOT STRONGER THAN PEOPLE GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR I THINK THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES ARE A LOT BETTER THE ME I THINK THE LEAST OF TH UNITED STATES SOCK I THINK THEY'RE TERRIBLE BUT I THINK T AT H GENERALIZED AMERICAN PUBLIC IS NOT NEARLY IS TERRIBLE AS OUR LEADST TEN TO THINK THAT THEY ARE ERE'S MY CUCKABY WHO'S A IU KN A SORT OF GIVING THE RIGHTWING VERSION OF THE ARGME JUST HEARD FROM JOSCARBOROUGH AND A JONATHAN ALIR DO YOU KNOW HOW POLITICAL OPPONENTS TO THOSE IN POWER OR DOUT WITH AN THIRD WORLD ICTATOR SHIPS THE NAT AR OPUBLICS

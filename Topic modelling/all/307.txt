THE QUICKMEN ITSELF WAS KIND OF MESMERIZING WITH ITS FALSE CHAMBERS AND FLAPS AND SECRETS OF THE AUDIENCE DID KNOW LIKE EVERY TRICK HAD A PRINCIPLE BEHIND IT AND WAS COOL TO THINK ABOUT THE PRINCIPLS THE MAGICIAN O RICKY JAY ONE SAID THIS THING IN AN INTERVIEW HE SAID THERE ARE MANY EFFECTS IN MAGIC WERE WOULDS GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES IS ACTUALLY MUCH MORE INTERESTING THANWHITH THE AUDIENC SEES AND HIS MAGICIAN WHU SODTO ONE TO SAY IF ONLY YOU COULD KNOW WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING HERE NEVER THE LAST YE MONCE DAVID AND I DOVE INTO A BUNCH OF STORIES WITH ACTUAL MASTER MAGICIANS AND I HAVE TO SAY THE MOST EXCITING MOMENTS IN ALL THOSE STORIES ARE ABOUT THAT TABOUT HOW INTRICED AND PSYCHOLOGICAL AND INGENIOUS WHAT THEY DO IS AD EVEN AS WAVE BEEN WRITING IN EDITING THE STORIES LIK OVER AND OVER I'VE GOTTEN THAT FEELING OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT IT THAT I USED TO GET HANDLING THE PRAPS OR PRACTICING THE CUPS AND BALLS AND THATS TO DAY SHOW FROM EVB EASY CHICAGO ITSO THIS AMERICAN LIFE ON OUR GLASS STAY WITH US ECON THE OLD IST TRICK IN THE BOOK IT CAN TAKE YEARS TO COME UP WITH THE MAGIC TRICK SEVERAL MAGICIANS TOLD ME THIS WHICH MAYNY WONDER WHAT ARE THEY DOING ALL THAT TIME LIKE WHAT TAKES YEARS TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT JUST A COUPLE MINUTES LONG AND ISN' THE PARTO MAGIC I REALLY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT FOM MY TIME IS A KID MAGICIAN I CAN NEVER INVENTED A TRICK THEN EVEN OCCUR TO ME S I WANTED TO SEE IT OEU DN'T OW ON EMPTIVY CRIBS WHEN THEY OULD DO THE HOUSE STORES AND GET TO THE BEDROOM SGUYES WOULD ALWAYS SAY THIS IS WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS AN OOKET VERY DIFFERENT CONTECTS BUT THE ACT OF INVENTING A MAGIC TRICK LIKE THAT ACTUALLY WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS AND I WANTED TO FINALLY WITNESS THE DARK BEATING HEART OF WHERE MAGIC COMES FROM I WANTED A MAGICION TO EXPLAIN STEP BY STEP WHAT TAKES YEARS UT THE WONE MAGICIAN WHO SEEMED NOTOUS INTERESTED BUT ACTUAL KIND EAGER TO COME FORWARD AND DO THAT WAS TELLER OT PEN AND TELLER TELLERS THE SMALLER ONE THEG ONE HE NEVER SPEAKS IN THE ACT BUT CORSE IN REAL LIFE HE TALKS AND HE LIKE THE IDEA OF EXPLAINING HOW A TRICK IS MADE HE WENT SAID IN ELECSHURE BECAUSE IF YEL UNDERSTAY THE GOOD MAGIC TRICK AND I M REALLY UNDERSTOD THAT WRIHTE O TO THE MA CALICS SO THE CORE OF ITS PSYCHOLOGY THE MAGIC TRICK GETS BETTER NOT WORSE THE TRICKEY AGREED TO EXPLAIN HERE ON THE RADIO AS ONE THAT HE LOVES TO PERFORM IT PERFORMS A LOT AN H STARTED WORKING ON IT YEARS AGO TOOKING TO INVENT SOMETHING NEW FORPEN AN TELLER'S LIVE STAGE SHOW HERE WAS HIS OLD EFFECT THAT HE WAS INTRIGUED BY SE MIGHT THERE IGHT BE SOMETHING IN IT THAT HE CULT ADAPT FOR HIMSELF IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR A MAGICIAN LIKE TELLER TO TAKE SOME SECRET FROM A VERY OLD TRICK IT WERE PURPOSE IT INTO SOMETHING ORIGINALL HIS PARTICULA ONE CAME FROM A MAGIC BOOK WRITTEN IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES AND THIRTIES BY A GUY IN NABRASKA NAMED DAVID P ABOT AND I MAT YOURE MAGICIAN WHO MADE HIS LIVING IS ALONE SHARK HIT WAS FAMOUS AMONG MAGICIANS BACK THEN HET INVENT THESE INCREDIBLE EFFECTS AND PERFORM THEM BUT ONLY IN HIS LIVING ROOM HE THOUGHT THAT WAS THE BEST PLACE FOR MAGIC WHOO DE THE THIRST TOOD TELLER ALL THE BIG NAVES OF MAGIC WOULD COME TO THIS GUY'S LITTLE HOUSE IN OLHON THE BRASKA TO SEE THESE GREAT SHOWS AND TOWARDS THE END OF HIS LIFE WHEN PEOPLE WOULD COME TO HIS HOUSE HE WOULD SHOW HE WOULD SHOW YOU THE BOOK THAT HE HAD THET IT WAS ALL F HIS MAGIC EXPLAIND IDN'T DETAIL HE DIED THE BOOK WASN'T PUBLISHED HIS WIFE SAID SHE WOULD PUBLISHEIT SHE DIED TWO YEARS LATER THE HOUSE WAS SOLD THE BOOK AD VANISHED IT WAS A LEGEND IN A CERTAIN CORNER OF THE MAGIC WORLD THIS LOST BOOK WIT THES INCREDIBLE SECRETS WHEN PUBLISHER WENT ON A DECATES LONG QUEST TO LOCATE THE BOOK FOUND PIECES OF IT AND THIN FINALLY A FULL MANUSCRIPT AND FOUR LEGAL SIZES LUCELY FINDERS FORTY YEARS LATER A NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR IN PUT IT INTO PRINT FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THE TRICK THAD ATTRACTED TALLER WAS THIS GOLDEN BALL SIX ENTES ACROSS LIKE A SMALL CANNON BALL THAT ABIT COULD FLOAT AROUND HIS LIVING ROOM THAT WASUPPOST TO BE ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ROUTINES IN MAGIC THAT'S EXACTLY TELLR'S TASTE TELL E LOVE IS DOING SILENT BEAUTIFUL TRICKS ALONE ON STAGE AN SOLA BITS LIKE THIS ARE IN EVERY PEN AN TELLER STAGE SHO IS MOST FAMOUS TREAD IS A PANTOMINE WITH A ROWS SHADOW ON A CARVING KNIFE I'L LIKE STRIPPING THINGS DOWN TO THE ABSOLUTE SIMPLICITY AND IT SEEMS LIKE A BALL AND A HOOP AND A PERCON IS ABOUT AS SIMPLE AS YOU CAN GET SO HE GOT TO WORK OH AND I STARTED BY TAKING THE ORIGINAL DAVID PABI BOOK THIS LONG LOST BOOK AND I SET THIS BOOK ON A MUSIC STAND MY LIBRARY AT HOME AND I LEARNED THIS LET ME JUST PAUSE ON THIS PAGE SO THIS A PAGE WHICH SHAS SEVEN PHOTOGRAPHS AND IS THAT ABBOT THAT'S DAVID PIABIT YES HE LOOKS A BIT LIKE A WHITE HAIRED FIRE PLUG AND HE'S IN A BLACK SUIT AND HE'S MOVING A HOOP OVER A BALL AND HIS LITTLE ARROWS INDICATING WHICH WAY YOU TURN IT THIS WAY AND THAT YES THE LEVEL OF THE TAIL THAT HE PROVIDED WAS ASTOUNDING SO I ME I I FEEL LIKE HE'S HE IS SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO ME HE TELLS YOU HOW TO MAKE THE PAPER MASHAE THAT YOU MAKE A BALL OT ISTRIPS OF NEWSPAPER EX WIDE ANDLET ME LET ME SHOW YOU SOME OF THE ISOME OF THE THE BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL FLOATING MOVES THAT HE CREATED AH THE CAY WAS STANDING UP AND WALK ACROSS THE STAGE I MAY BE IS HO TI MENTION THIS EARLIER TELL ER AN MY COWORKER DAVID CASTEBAM AND IRE DOING THIS INTERVIEW ON THE STAGE WERE PEN AN TELLER DO THEIR MAGIC SHO FIVE NIGHTS A WEEK IN MY SPA GUES AND BIK THEATRE AT THE REO HOTEL AND WE LEFT T GO QUITE A DISTANCE TY OF THISORK TELL HER PICKS UP THE BALL AND THE THREAD HE ASK US NOT TO STAY ANYTHING HERE ON THE RADIO ABOUT THE DETAILS OF WHERE THE THREAD GOES OR HOW EXACTLY IT ANTRACTS WITH THE BALL BUT I STILL LIGHT I CAN SAY S A PICTURE A GUY AND A WHOOP AND A BALL AND A VERY LONG THREAD ON A STAGE THE EARLY DAYS OF THIS I'M LEARNING MOVES TO MAKE THE BALL FLOAT AND OW A SAY I THE BALL IS FLOATING UP THE STRING TOWARDS YOU AND THEN FROM YOUR LEFT HAND TO YOUR RIGHT HAND YOU'REACTUALLY CATCHING THE SOUND OF IT WHICH IS WHICH IS NOT NORMALLY AUDIBLE TO TO ANORDIENCE RACSE CAN I JUS REUST DO IT TELL A GESTRIO BA LIKE HE SUMMONING IT WITH HIS HAND AND IT GLIDES ALONG THE THREAD TO HIM THAT'S A SOUND YOUR HERIG I WIT'S MIND MENDING IS THAT DAVID I CAN ACTUALY SEE THAT HE'S TILTING THE THREAD DOWNWARDS AND THAT'S WHY IT SIDES TOWARDS HIM BUT WE CAN SEE THE BALLS ON A THREAD WE CAN SEE HOW IT'S DYNE WE HEAR IT SLIDING ALAM AIT'S PRITIC AND AT THE SAME TIME IT TOTALLY LOOKS LIKE HE'S THIS SORCERER WHO ENCHANTED THIS AN ANIMATE OBJECT INTO ABEYING HIM  THAT IS SO BEAUTIFUL ACTALLY WHEN YOU SEE THE THREAD YES IT IS HEARE'S HER'S ONE OF DAVID PABOTS MOVES THAT THE IVENT THE BALL IS FLOATING FROM HAND TO HAND WITHOUT REALLY ANY MOVEMENT ON THE PART OF EITHER OF THE EITHER OF THE HANDS JUST BY AN INTRICATE WHEYTHER THE THREAD IS  INTERLACED  IN THE THINGERS THEN TAKES THE HOOP AND SPENDED AROUND THE BALL IN VARIOUS WAYS WHICH MAKES IT LOOK LIKE THERE CAN'T POSSIBLY BE A THREAD THERE BUT OF COURSE WE CAN SEE THE THREAD CAN I SAY THAT'S CRAZY THAT'S SO CONVINCING YOUR BRAIN REALLY CANNOT SERT THAT YOUR BRAIN CAN NOT SORT THIS OUT IT'S VISUAL DOUBLE TALK IT'S AMAZING I'M SITTING HERE I'M DOING IT AND IT STILL FOOLING MY BRAIN WHICH I TOTALLY REMEMBER FROM BEING A KID MAGICIAN AND PRACTICING THE THUMB PALM IN THE FRENCH DROP AND ALL THE OTHER SLEDTEF HAND IN FRONT OF A MIRROR IF YOU DO IT RIGHT IT FOOLS YOU YOU KNOW IT FEELS AMAZING TO YOU AND THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW THE TRICKES WORD THIS WIS TELLER'S FIRST STEP TO INVENTING HIS OWN VERSION IN THE TREAD HESPEND MINTS MASTERING DAVID PABOTS MOVES FROM A HUNDRED YEARS AGO I STARTED TO FIGURE AT WHAT ELSE HE CAN MAKE THE BALLO ON HIS OWN HOUR PACTICE EVERY DAY IT THE BOLLANTHREAD ON VACATION WITH HIM AND VIDIOTAPE HIMSELF SEE HOW THE MOVES LI OH NO I ISTRAY US WITH I HERE I AM IN A CABIT IN YOU TALK MY PAJAMAS I JUST I WAS JUST SUBSESSED WITH IT HE TOOK A TRIP TO TERONTO WERE A AGICIAN FRAND TOUGHT HIM THE VERSION OF THE FLOATING BALL ROUTINE THAT HE DID AND THE MA TOLER WAS THERE HE TRIED THIS THING JUST CON IT MESSING AROUND HE PUT THE BALL ON A BENCH AND LIFTED ONE END OF THE BENCH AND THEN MADE THE BALL ROLL UP THE BENCH ND THEN LATER HE HAD THE THOT THAT THE FOOTING BALL AS ACTUALLY MORE INTERESTING TO WATCH WHEN IT'S NOT FLOATING HEN IT'S JUST THIS BALL THAT SOMEHOW ALIVE AND ROWING ROUND IT'S WEIRDER AND IT'S MORE MYSTERIOUS IS LESS CLEAR WHAT'S PROPELLING IT IT BEGAN TO CROSS MY MIND THAT NO OND HAD EVER DONE A FLOATING BALL THAT DID FLOAT AND I WAS I WAS JUBILENT I THOUGHT OH WHY I GOT AN I I FINALLY GOT AN IDEA I FINALLY GOT IN O RIGINAL IDEA TO GO WITH THIS WITH THIS WITH THIS METHOD THE NEXT STEP WAS TO PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER INTO ROUTINE LIKE AND ACTUAL TRICK AS IT MIGHT BE PERFORMED THIS ABOUTE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INVENTION MAKING UP ALL KINDS OF NEW MOVES ON HIS OWN FOR THE FLOATING BALL THAT DOES NOT FLOAT HERE'S HERE'S A MOVE WERE I KICK IT ACROSS THE STAGE IN THE LAND SOFTLY I COME MAG JUST DISCRBER YOU DOIG SAY KICKING THE BALL ON ITS GOING MAY BE TWELVE FEET OUT THERE AND THEN SUDDENLY COMING TO A STOP AND JUST SITTING ON THE FLOOR WHAT YOU WOULD THINK IN REAL LIFE IF YOU KICK A BALL THE BALL DOESN'T STOP UNTIL IT RUNS OUT A MOMENTUM SO THIS IS SUDDENLY THAT BALT STOPS STOPS DEBD UNBELIEVABLY DIFFICULT IT'S IT'S ME USING LEVERAGE AND SLACK AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS I AI HES PEND MINDS INVENTING THESE MOVES AN NINE ALONE IN THE THEATRE AFTER THEY FINISHED THE SHOWS AND ALL THIS WAS PREPARATION TO SHOW HIS PARTNER PAN AND THIS POINT HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING IT WAS A LOT OF PREPARATION ALL SORTS OF THINGS I COAN BEEN PRACTISING WITH HA SILVER BALL I GAVE IT PABIT'S MYSTERIOUS FLOATING GOLD OR AND NOW E ER PLACED IT WITH A KID'SBAL THE BOUNC THE SIZE OF A KICK BAL HIS MAGIC IS MORE MAGICAL IF YOU DO WITH REAL STOP  PEOPLE KNOW AN HE BUT A SAT IT'S CHANGLING FANC CAUSE HE THOUGHT READY SEE KIDS BAL AT PLAYGROUND BUT HE SAYS WHEN HE PUT THE CHANGLING FENCE UP ON STAGE IT SUDDENLY FELT LIKE THE SET OF GOD SPOU AND HE DIDT SID DAVID NI ASKED TELLER WHY DNEG TO SHOW PAN SOMETHING ROB TO SOMETING WITH THE MOVES YOU'D BEEN INVENTING HE SAID NOW NO THAT'S HE THING BOUT MAGIC YOU YOU CAN'T LOOK AT A HALF FINISHED PIECE OF MAGIC AND KNOW WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR NOT IT HAS TO BE PERFECT BEFORE YOU CAN IVALUEWATE WHETHER IT'S GOOD NHE MAGIC IS A FANTASTICALLY METICULOUS FORM YOU YOU FORGIVE OTHER FORMS A MUSICIAN MISSES A NOTE MOVES ON FIE YOU KNOW IHE'LL COME TO THE CONCLUSION OF THE PIECE MAGIC IS S AN ON OFF SWITCH EITHER IT LOOKS S LIKE A MIRACLE OR IT'S STUPI SO I SPENT UP I I WOULD GESS IT WAS IT WAS PROBABLY ELEVEN MONTHS OR SO PUTTHING TOGETHER A ROUTINE OF MOVES THAT I INVENTED IWITH THE NON FLOATING FLOATING BALL AND I SHOWED IT TE PEN DESCRIBED THE ACT THAT HE SAW LIKE WHAT WAS IT I BELIEVE THAT WHAT HE SAW WAS VERY VERY ARTSIN IT WAS VERY LONELY IT WAS VERY SWEETLY MELANCHOLY IT WAS TRYING TO RECREATE THAT SENSE OF SOLITUDE IN IU KN IN A THEATRE LATER NIGHT  HE SAT WAY BACK IN THE THEATRE WAIT TOWARDS THE BACK I SO THAT HE COULD GET A WIDE STAGE VIEW OF IT I FINISHED IT AND HE QUIETLY GOT UP AND LEFT THE THEATRE AND I THOUGHT  THAT'S PROBABLY NOT A GOOD SIGN SO I WENT BACK TO HIS DRESSING ROOM AND WE TALKED FOR A WHILE I NEVER BEING IN THE DRESS ROM BEING REALLY REALLY REALLY WICKED UNCOMFORTABLETHIS OF COURSE THIS TELLER STAGE PARTNER PENDULAT ERE WAS NOTHING ABOUT IT THE GRABME I THOUGHT IT WAS TACNICALLY GOOD AS A JUGGLING BIT I THOUGHT IT WAS OCA JUGLING HE MEANS THE MECHANICS OF MOVING THE BALL AROUND I WAS THE FIRST TIME WED REALLY HAD SOMETHING THAT OUTSIDE OF OUTSIDE OF THE OVERLAP TO GET INTO THE PENAN TELLER SHOW IT HAS TO BE AN IDEA THAT APPEALS TO BOTH PEN AND ME AND HE SAID AND TO HIS CREDIT HE SAID THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS WAY TO CIRC DISOLAY IT WAS WAG TO SORT OF ARTSE PRETENSIOUS I REMEMBER TELLER GIVING A LOOD IT MAT OF ME CAUS I SAID  WHAT'S THE IDEA BEYIND  AND HE WAS A VERY OFFENDED HIT WAS LIK IT THE IDEAIS THE TRICK YOU KNOW AND I THINK IT HADN'T CLICKED WITH HIM BECAUSE IT LACED AND A SENTRAL DRAMATIC IDEA OF COURSE TO ME I IM I WAS I WAS ALL WRAPPED UP IN THE IDEA THAT IT WAS A FLOATING WILE WASN'T FLOATING WHICH ISN'T A VERY GOOD IDEA AN IT'S THAT'S NOT AN IDEA THAT COMMUNICATES TO AN AUDIENCE HE EX SDAY STARBUXS THEY TALKED ABOUT WHAT IDEA MIGHT WORK WITH THE TRICK PEN SUG GEST IT PRESENTING IT THIS A KIND OF HISTORY PIECE AND OD COSSAC THE PERIOD MUSIC A KIND OF THING THE WOULD DO IN A MAGIC HISTORY CONFERENCE TELL IU I'T EXCITED ABOUT THAT HE MET HIM LATER ADDING TO THE IDEA LIKE THEY TELL THE ODIENCE HE WAS USING A METHOD FROM A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THAT ELECTRONIC ACNOLEGY AND KNO HELP FROM OFF STAGE IMAGINING THAT VERGIN IN THE TRICK PEN RON IM BACK QUOTE FROM READING THIS AF LOSS LITTLE FAITH IN THE IDEA I GUESS WE CAN TRID THIS BUT IT DISN'T EEN TO BRING ANOTHER LEVEL IN AND WHICH ITIS DO IT THE WAT HE WANTED AND NOT LOOK FOR MORE HERE I'M SURE PE BILL LIKE COALD FIND IO NOW IT SEEMS TO MAKE A LOT OF WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE MAY BE WORSE I IN 'T OF TO LIKE EVERY BET IN THE SHOW THAT'S FOR SURE TOLL ITIN Y THAT SEEM WRONG FOR PEN TO SETTLE HE GOT BACK TO WORD  SOLE THE PROBLEM AND HIS YOU'RE MAKING THIS TRICK TURN FROM JUST THE MECHANICS MOVING A BALL AROUND ON THA THREAD TACTUALLY THINKING THROUGH WHAT TELLS A STORY WAT'S ENGAGING WUT'S FUN TO WATCH WHAT SATISFYING TELL I REALIZED ONE OF THE THNGS THAT WAS MISSING FROM THE TRICK HE SAYS ANY MAGIC TRICK IS BETTER IF THERE'S A REASON THE MAGIC HAPPENS SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU PUT LET'S SAY A COIN INTO YOUR HAND CLOSE YOUR HAND SNAP YOUR FINGERS OPEN IT AND THE COIN IS GONE THERE'S NOT MUCH OF AN IMPACT TO THAT AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THE ACTION SEEMS ARBITRARY THAT THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A CAUSE THET MAKE THAT EF THET HAPPEN IOOT LIKE LIKE WHY WOULD A COIN DISAPPEAR YES IIF YOU PUT THE SAME COIN IN YOUR HAND CLOSE YOUR HAND AND EVEN DO JUST THIS EVEN JUST SAY TAKE OUT AS A A MATCH LIKE THE MATCH PASS IT AROUND YOUR HAND AN ACT WITH A SUDDEN JOLT AS THOUGH SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED INSIDE YOUR HAND WITH A COIN MELTED AWAY AND YOU'VE BEEN BURNT AND YOU OPEN YOUR HAND AND THERE'S NO COIN NOW THAT LEVEL OF ACTING THAT LEVEL OF CAUSALITY THAT SUGGESTS THAT SOMEHOW THE FIRE OF A MATCH COULD MAKE A COIN MELT AWAY SUDDENLY ADDS A DIMENSION TO IT THAT I THINK IS PRETTY CRUCIAL BUT'S O SO HE GIVES IT STORY IE'S THAT A LITTLE BIT OF A STORY IT GIVES IT IT GIVES IT EMOTION AND I REALIZE THAT I WAS DOING ALL OF THIS STUFF WITH NOTHING CAUSING IT THERE WAS NO CAUSE WHY IS THE BALL MOVING AROUND I THE BALL IS JUST MOVING AROUND IT WAS JUST ARBITRARY MOVEMENT WHEN I TELL US COLLABORATORS HE BETTERIN MAGESY NAME JOHNNY COMSEND VE MEN SUGGESTION THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING NOW HE SAD YOU GOT A TREAT THE BAL LIKE A TRAIN DOG HET WIL GIVE A REASON FOR ITS MOVEMENT WOGEC CAUSE TO TELL IT TRIED IT I I THOUGHT WHAT YOU WHAT IS A TYPICALLY A TRAIN DOG TO I JUMPS THROUGH A HOOP SO A TRAIN DOG IS NOT ALWAYS GOING TO DO WHAT IT ONCE WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO I'D HOLD IT THE HOOP THE DOG WOULDN'T RESPOND I'D CALL THE DOG AND INSTHEAD OF JUMPINGTHROUGH THE HOOP IT WOULD COME OVER AND LAND ON THE ROYM OF THE HOOP I SIT DOWN AND IGNORE IT WHAT IS THE DOG DO WHEN YOU IGNORE IT WHILE I VERY OFTEN COMES TO YOU AND WHAT WE HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENED WHAT'S HAPPENING AS I'M REALIZING THAT THE PLOT OF THIS IS THE DOG TRAINER IS GETTING THE DOG TO JUMP THROUGH HOOP THAT BECOMES THE PLOT THAT BECOMES A LITTLE BIT OF A STORY NOW I HAN'T A PLOT AND A STORY TELL IT ID SOMETHING ELSE AT THIS STAGES IT'S SO ESSENTIAL AND BASES IT TO THE KIND OF DRAMA THAT PARTICULARLY HAPPENS IN A MAGIC SHEWL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU DO AS A MAGICIAN IS YOU TRY TO YOU YOU TRY TO PUT YOURSELF IN THE POSITION OF THE AUDIENCE AT EVERY MOMENT YOU SAY WHAT WOULD I BE THINKING AS THIS MOMENT AND YOU TRY TO MANIPULATE THAT ONE OF THE WAYS YOU DO THAT IS MY GIVING THE ONIENCE A LITTLE CHANCE TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT ASN'T TAKE IT AWAY FROM AND SO HE DOES THAT WITH THIS ROUTINE RE IMAGINES IT THE BALL STARTS ON THE BENCH ALWAYS IN CONTACT WITH THE BENCH SO THE AUDIENCE WILLTHINK THE BALL IS CONTROLLED BY THE BENCH ANDTHT HE LIFTS THE BALL OFF THE BENCH IT STICKS TO HIS FINGER AND FLOATS IN THE AIR SO THEY MGHT CONCLUDE THAT IT'S HIS FINGER THAT CONTROLS THE BAL D THEN HE DROPS TO THE FOR AWAY FROM HIS FINGER SO EAC'H TIME YOU THINK OF SOMETHING I GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO THINK OF THAT AND THAT I TAKE IT AWAY FROM YOU ONE ONE THING AFTER THE OTHER I TAKES A LOT OF WORK HE FINISHES THE NEW ROEUTINE SHOWS IT TO HIS PARTNER PEN WHO HATES IT TRUEE TRUE HE HATES IT JUST HE MAKES IT FURTHER AWAY MY TAKI  AT LEAST IT WAS AN ABSTRACTBLY GID THING IT'S CLOSEIT MY TASTE WHAT'S BECOMES SOMETHING LIKE A DOG IT'S MOVED VERY FAR OITI BECAUSE YOU HATE AND ANIMATED  SHO WITE TO I HATE I HATE OM I HATE ANTABLE MORPHISM I DON'T LIKE RELATIONSHIPS WITH ANIMALS FOR A ANL OF OBJECTS AT ALL WHICH IS BASICLLY WITH THE SI E BUT SE THE THING IS WHO WHERE IS MY ARGUMENT WHERE IS HIS ARGUMENT LIKE WHAT IS HE SUPPOSED TO SAY THIS A DELICATE CONVERSATION RIN HERE THESE TWO MEN HO RESPECT EACH OTHER BIT DON'T SOCIALIZE OR HANG OUT TOGETHER HO BEEN ARGUING THEY SAY CONSTANTLY AND FIERCELY BUT PRODUCTIVELY FOR EVER FORTY YEARS AND PAN KNOWS HOW MUCH WORK TELLER IS PUT INTO THIS TRICK AND HOW MICT UTE ENJOY PERFORMING IT EVERY NIGHT AND TI'S NOT SAYING THIS OUT RIGHT BUT IT'S IT'S IMPLICIT  THIS IS BEAUTIFUL THIS IS MISTER FOING THIS IS ENTERTAINING PEOPLE WILL LOV IT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME ALL THOSE FIVE THINGS ARE TRUE SOIT'S VERY VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AD CONTOBO BECAUSE PEN AGREES IT'S A GREAT TRICK TOTALLY WORKS HE DOES DOESN'T LIKE IT IT DOESN'T EEL LIKE THEIR SHOW TO HIM TIS RED BALL THAT'S ALSO A DISOBEDIENT POPPY THAT'S LIKE THE KIND OF IDEA YOU MIGHT SEE IN A CARTOON AND THE TRIED ABOUT THE SHOL AROUND THE PRINCIPLE THAT THERE HOULD BE NOTHING IN THE SHOW THAT FEELS EVEN VAGUELY FAMILIAR TO THE AUDIENCE NOTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE SEEING IN ANYBODY ELSE'S WORK SO PEN DOESN'T SAY YES WHENS THEY KNOW EITHER HE DOES A TELLER TO BE IN THE SHOW IT STILL NEEDS ONE MORE IDEA TO REALLY MAKE IT OURS NOW IAVE RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER IT TRY TO COME UP WITH THAT IDEA AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE WHOF IS BROUGHT IT UP I THINK I'M THE ONE WHO SAID WHAT IF WE ACTUALLY SAID I SAID THE  WHEN MIKE CLOSE AND JOHNNY THOMPSON CAME AND WATCH ME DO THIS TRICK TESY DO OTHER MAGICIONS THEY ADMIRE THEY KNEW THERE WAS A THREAD THERE AND BECAUSE THEY KNEW THERE WAS A THREAD THERE THEY WERE MORE BAFFLED THEN AN AUDIENCE THAT COULD IMAGINE THAT THERE WAS THATHIS WAS BEING DONE WITH A LITTLE GYROSCOPE INSIDE THE INSIDE THE BALL SO I SAID WHAT IF WE SAY RIGHT OUT AT THE TOP HERE'S HE TRICK THAT'S DUG WITH A PIECE OF THREAD IN A SPECIAL BACK DROP THEN SAD I THINK ALL YOU NEED IS NOW HERE'S HA TRICK THAT'S DONE WITH A PIECE OF THREAD THAT GIVES THEM SO MUCH IT BRINGS THEM OVER ON T OUR SIDE AND SUDDENLY THIS NOW HAD AN IDEA AND THE IDEA WAS BIGGER THAN THE LITTLE PLOT WITH THE LITTLE BALL IT WAS BIGGER THAN ALL THE LITTLE MAGIC TRICKS IT WAS THAT YOU CAN STATE THE ACTUAL METHOD OF A MAGIC TRICK CLEARLY AT THE BEGINNING OF IT AND IT CAN STILL FULL THE HELL OUT IT CAN TI THAT THAT WHAT BY KNOWING THIS EXTRA PIECE OF INFORMATION THE TRICK BECOMES BETTER ANOTHER IDS IF THE AUDIENCE IN THE THEATRE THE SAME FEELING THAT DAVID I HAD STANDING ON STAGE SEEING THE THREAD AND STILL FEELING A MAZE NOT THE AUDIENCE CAN SEE THE THREAD BUT THEY KNOW IT'S THERE SOMEWHERE PENDID LOBBY A LITTLE FOR SUDDEN CHANGE IN LIGHTING THE BOOM WOULD REVEAL THE THREAD TO THE AUDIENCE FULLY VISIBLE IN THE END THIS SOLUTION JUST TELLING THEM ABOUT THE THREAD WAS ENOUGH FOR HIM AN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER TELLER PICKED UP DAVID P ABIT'S BOOK TO PRACTICE FOR THE FIRST TIME HE AN PEN ADDED THE BALL TO THEIR SHELL IS NOT THE LONGEST THEYVE EVER WORKED ON A TRICK NOT EVEN CLOSE HE TOLD ME ABOUT ONE THAT TOOK HIM SIX YEARS MAKING ANYTHING GOOD TAKES TIME THIS A THERE'S A QUIT THAT A YOUR PARTNER AR FORTY YEARS PENCUL HAT SAID ABOUT YOU IT'S KIND OF MEAN THERE'S NO BETTER PARTNER THAN TELLER THES HE'S NOT THE SMARTEST OR MOST CREATIVE PERSON OF EVER BEEN AROUND BUT HE'S THE HARTICED WORKING HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP YOU CAN PUT HIM ON A SINGLE TASK IN THE MIDDLE OF IT HID HIM WITH A BASEBALL THAT SQUARE IN A FACE AND HE GOES RIGHT BACK TO THE TASK WI'M SURE HE'S TALKING DIRECTLY ABOUT THIS BIST AND AND THAT IS TRUE IT IS TRUE I I HAVE A CERTAINLY TE DOG WITH A SLIPPER QUALITY ABOUT ME ESPECIALLY I DOLL TRUST MY GOT THIS TRICK THAT WE DO IN THE SHOW HIS NOT THE TRICK THAT I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO DO BUT IT IS THE TRICK IT WAS CALL WE OUT TOICS O TELLER TEERED UP AS HE SAID THIS I TOLD HIS PARTNER PEN YER HE DOES E DOES GET CHOKED UP ABOUT TTHES STUFF I GET CHOKED UP ABOUT O IT'S NOT IT THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE PEN AND TELLER EVEN THE WAY THEY TELL THIS STORY IN TELLER'S TELLING THE STRAY HAS A HAPPY END THEY ADDED THE EXTRA IDEA F COMPROMISEWAS REACHD THE PARTNERSHIP WORKED WHEN PEN TELLS THE STORY THE COMPROMISE IS LITTLE DEEPER I THINK THAT A TELLER DOS A BEAUTIFUL JOB AND THE AUDIENCE LOVES IT AND A KIND OF ZON OUT IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THAT THE WHOLE BIT JUS SNAPS INTO WHAT IT SHOULD BE YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T FEEL AMON NOW EVEN NOW OR YOU KNOW EVEN NOW YOU'RE NOT INTO THAT TRICK NO TE TELL MEN I KNOW THAT BUT A ME TELL HER MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT EVERY SHOW ORDER WE COME UP WITH AT SOME POINT I SUGGEST WE HAVE A SHOW O THROUGH IT HE I NOTICE THAT I NOFTEN NOTD YEHADED IT IS A PATTERN THAT SHOWS UP BUT CAN I SAY AGAIN REALLY GOOD TRICK HE IS A BEAUTIFUL JOB HE WORKED REALY HARD AND THE AUDIENCE LOVES TELLER TOLD ME OF COURSE HE KNEW THE PEN STILL AT HIS TOUT IT DON'T WORK TO GETHER SO LONG HE SAID WITHOUT KNOWING SOMETHING LIKE THAT INTERESTINGLY AFTER FIVE YEARS PERFORMING THIS TRICK THEY CHANGE THE ENDING THAD MORE OF WHAT PEN ON IT WHICH IS UN DELIND THE FACT THAT IT'S DONE WITH THE THREAD ALITTLE MORE HE DE THIS VERSION ON THE TRICK ON LINE IS VIDIO FROM PEN AN TELLERS TENECIO FOLAS MAV WILL LINK AT OUR WIPSIDE HERE'S AT THEY ADDED TO FINALLY FINISHED THE TRC FOR GEN OVER SIX YEARS AFTER TELL OUR FIRST STARTED PRACTICING WITH THATBITS BOOK ANT THE END OFTHE RETIN PEN WALKS OUT ON STAGE GRADS THE THREAD FROM TOLER AND THEN DANGLES THE BALL FROM THE THREA PEN TAKES AN OVERSIZE SESSORS CUTS THE THREAD THBALL DROPPES TO THE GROUND AND PENN KICKS THE BALL CROSS THE STAGE IT AS MAD WHAT IS ACTING OF COURSE WE WAYS

EXACTLY THE WAYS TILLANG A MACOPPERFIELD HAS AN AUDIENCE SITTING RIGHT THERE ON LIBERTY ISLAND AT THE FOOT OF THE STATUEEVERY ONE IS STTING ON THE STAGE S OUT DOORS LOOKING UP AT THE HUGE STATUE OF LIBERTY WHICH IS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET AWAYTHERE ARE SPOTLIGHTS ON IT AND A HELICOPPER CIRCLING OVERHEAD OUR VIEW IS THE SAME AS THE AUDIENCE WERE JUST BEHIND THEM LOOKING UP AT THE STTUE TUE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE STAGE ARE TWO BIG SCAFFOLDING TOWERS KIND OF FRAMING THE SHOT YOU'VE A VIEW ITH THE STATUE BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS ONE CONTINUOUS CAMERSHOT NO VISIBLE ATTINCE A GINT CURTAIN IS HOISTED UP SUSPENDED BETWEEN THOSE TWO SCAFFOLDING TOWER HE CAN'T SEE THE STATUE NOW BUT IT HAS TO BE THERE RIGHT BEHIND THE CURTAI THEN COPPERFIELD PUTS HIS LEFT HAND TO HIS TEMPLE CLOSES HIS EYES THIS IS A SIGNATURE COPPERFIELD MOVE FAMILIAR TO METHAN NOW IT'S AS IF HE'S DOING IT WITH HIS MIND A FEW SECONDS PASSED THE CURTAINT DRAWNS AND PRICING GONE  TAT WHE'S GESPOTLIKE  THE HELICOPPER O SIR BUT NOW CIRCLING NOTHING JUST EMPTY SPACE THE CAMER CUTS TO REACTIONS FROM THE AUDIENCE EVERONE SEEMS ASTONISHED THERE'S ONE GUY WEARING A PRIEST'S COPP I WAS AMAZE YO E TER TATHERIY  DU OBODY I DEAS WERE WORE A NO I  LODE WOR  YOU AND THEN AN OLDER WOMA AV NASEE TAN A  A COPPERFIELD I THINK IM AN ATTEMPT TO LAND SOME LARGER MEANING MAKES A SPEECH ABOUT EMIGRANTSON HOW HE SHOULDN TAKE OUR LIBERTY FOR GRANTED THEN HE MAKES THE STATUE REAPPEAR EVEN JOE WEISEBURG THE NON MAGIC FAN WHEN HE FINALLY WATCHED IT AS INT A DULL HE WAS MOVED FORE JOLE AN ME AS GID MAGICIANSE WE TRIED TO FIGURE AT HOW HE DID IT DID YOUHAVE NY THEORIES I HAD I DID NOT HAVE A GOOD THEORYAN AND AS SOMEBODY WHO KNEW A LOT OF MAGIC GUIMICS ALWAYS PRETTY DON'T FOUND IT DID DID YOUR FRIEND SAY TELL ME HOW HE DID I I'M SURE THEY DID AND I THINK I WOULD HAVE I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T KNOW I'M NOT PROUD OF THIS BUT WHEN KIDS ASKED ME HOW COPPERFIELD DID IT IHAVE A PRETTY CLEAR MEMORY OF SAYING SOMETHING LIKE SORRY I CAN'T TELL YOU WHICH WAS TRUE I COULDN'T SOMETIMES IT IS NOT SO FUND TO LEARN HOW A TRICK IS DONE IT'S ALL DOUBLE LIFTS AND HIDDEN COMPARTMENTS AND WHEN YOU LEARN THE SECRET IT CAN BE KIND OF ELET DOWN BUT THERE ARE THOSE TIMES WHEN THE SECRET TO THE TRICK IS COOLER THAN THE TRICK IT SELL THE SHEER ANGENUITY AND GENIUS OF IT AND SO I AM GOING TO TALK NOW BUT HOW THIS TRICK MIGHT HAVE BEEN DONE WE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT WHETHER TO PUT THIS ON THE RADIO BUT THE TRUTH IS YOU ARE LL A SIMPLE GOOGL SEARCH AWAY FROM WHAT I AM ABOUT TO TELL YOU THAT IS ONE OF THE WEIRD THINGS ABOUT MAGIC TO DAY OVER THIRTY YEARS LATER THE INNER NET EXISTS IT'S A WHOLE WORLD OF EXPLANATIONS AND PRETTY GOOD INSTRUCTIONAL VIDIOS FOR A SPIRING MAGICIANS BUT IF YOU'D RATHER NOT GO DOWN THIS ROAD WITH ME YOU CAN SKIP AHEAD OR STOP LISTENING FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES I TOTALLY RESPECT THAT I SHOULD ALSO SAY WE DID REACH OUT TO DAVID COPPER FIEW AND WE MADE A PITCH WHICH WAS BASICALLY THIS MAY BE YOUR GREATEST HIT IT'S BEEN THIRTY FOUR YEARS NOW EVERY ONE IS GOING TO BE FOOLED BY THIS TRICK IS ARDU BEEN FOOL YOU'LL NEVER PERFORM IT AGAIN NOBODY'S GOING TO PERFORM IT AGAIN WE'RE NOT HURTING THE LIVELIHOOD OF ANY MAGICIAN BY REVEALING THE SECRET WHY NOT COME ON THE SHOW AND TALK ABOUT WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDE COPPERFIELD WAS COMPLETELY GRACIOUS BUT HE SAID IT WASN'T HIS JOB TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE TRICKS ARE DONE AND HE SAID SOMETHING ELSE HE SAID TO PROTECT THE SECRETS OF HIS TRICKS HE'S HIRED PEOPLE TO PUT FAKE EXPLANATIONS ON MINE TO THROW THE CURIOUS OFF THE TRACK WHICH OF COURSE MAKES THE WHOLE THING EVEN MORE INTERESTIN SO HERE IS THE EXPLANATION THAT IS ON THE INNER NET AND ALSO IN ONE BOOK WRITTEN BY A NON MAGICIAN INSTEAD OF MOVING THE STATUE COPPERFIELD MOVED  THE AUDIENCE THE ENTIRE AUDIENCE ROTATED THEM ACTUALLY THERE WERE SITTING UNKNOWINGLY ON A GIANT ROTATING PLATFORM THINK A HUGE LAZY SUSAN SO HERE'S HOW IT WOUL AE WORKED THE CURTAIN GETS HOISTED UP BETWEEN THE TWO TOWERS BLOCKING THE STATUE FROM VIEW AND WHILE IT'S UP THE PLATFORM WITH THE ENTIRE AUDIENCE ON IT AND THE GIANT SCAFFOLDING TOWERS AND THE CURTAIN THE WHOLE THING ROTATES UNTIL IT'S FACING AWAY FROM THE STATUE SO THAT WHEN THE CURTAIN FALLS THE AUDIENCE IS LOOKING OUT AT NOTHING OR I THINK TO BE PRECISE THEY'R LOKING OUT AT PART OF THE NEW JERSEY COST LINE IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL SECRET SMART AND SIMPLE DBIG THERE IS ANOTHER PART OF THE SECRET WHICH IS EVEN CRUELER WHEN I FIRST HURD THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A ROTATING PLATFORM AND WONDERED WHAT WAS TO STOP THE AUDIENCE MEMBERS FROM JUST TURNING THEIR HEADS AND SEEM THE STATUE AFTER ALL IT SHOULD AVE BEE JUST OFF TO ONE SIDE THE ANSWER IT'S HIDDEN IN WHAT IN RETROSPECT IS THE ONLY POSSIBLE PLACE BEHIND ONE OF THE SCAFFOLDING TOWERS USED TO HOLD THE CURTAIN UP HE SCAFFOLDING TOWERY'S TINY COM PARED TO THE STATUE BUT IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE AUDIENCE THAT WITH THE PLATFORM ROTATED TO JUST THE RIGHT POSITION THE TOWER BLOCKS THE STATUE FROM VIEW WATCHING THE TEVY SPECIAL AGAIN KNOWING THIS MADE IT EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE I KEPT THNKING HOW EXCITING AND NERVE RACKING IT MUST HAVE BEEN TO BE COPPERFIELD IN THAT MOMENT TO PULL THIS OFF THE ROTATION WOULD HAVE HAD TO BEEN FAST ENOUGH THAT IT DIDN'T SEEM TO TAKE TOO LONG BUT NOT SO FAST THAT SOME ONE WOULD NOTICE AND SUPER SMOOTH HERE IS JOLL FIELDS FORMER KED MAGICIAN FIRST ALL HOW COULD THE PEOPLE THERE NOT HAVE NOTICED SUCK HIGH STAKES R IT'S BALLSY BUT THESE PEOPLE ON THE THING AND LIKE HOPE THAT REALLY NO ONES CAN ANOTICE IT'S WILDLY GOT SETRICK WHA COULD IT T NOT WORK WHAT COULD HAVE GONE WRONG AH ONE OR MORE PEOPLE COULD HAVE SAID AVIS PLATFORM'S ROTATED SOME ONE COULD HAE A COMPASS THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS THE MORE QUESTIONS I HAD WAS THIS REALLY HOW IT WAS DONE COULD YOU GET AWAY WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT MAYBE THIS WAS A FAKE EXPLANATION PLANTED BY DAVID COPPERFIEL A SCAFFOLDING TOWER TO HIDE SOME DEEPER SECRET I FIGURE THE BEST THING WOULD BE TO TRACT DOWN SOME OF THE AUDIENCE MEMBERS WHO WERE THERE AT THE FOOT OF TE STATUE OF LIBERTY BUT REMEMBER IT THIS HAPPENED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AND IT ANY CASE NONE OF THE AUDIENCE MEMBERS ER NAME I DIDN'T SEE ANY EASY WAY TO TRACT OF DOWN BUT AS I WAS WATCHING IN REWATCHING THE VIDY OF THE TRICK I FOUND ONE SHOT WHERE SOME ONE'S NAME WAS REVIAL SOME ONE I COULD TRYED AT CONTACK IT COMES IN THE LEAD UP WHERE COPPERFIELD IS IN THE OFFICE OF THE PARK SERVICE OFFICIAL FOR THE STATUE OF LIBERTY IT'S JUST A QUICK COTAWAY WHERE HE'S EXPLAINING THAT HE HAD TO GET PERMISSION TO MAKE THE STATUE DISAPPEAR BUT IF YOU FREEZE FRAME ON THAT PART YOU CAN JUST MAKE OUT ON THE MAN'S DESK A NAME PLATE DAVID L MAFITT I HAD NO IDEA IF THE SKY WAS STILL LIVE THIS WAS AFTER ALL THIRTY FOR YEARS AGO BUT I STARTED SEARCHING FOR A DAVID L MAFITT AND I FOUND ONE IN VIRGINIA BUT WITH A PREVIOUS RESIDENCE OF LIBERTY ISLAND I I GOT ON A PLAIN TO FLY DOWN THROUGH REC A AWT A AT WIT MY RAT WA  CARI  FOR TEN YEARS IF YOU WANTED TO DO ANYTHING WITH THE STATUE OF LIBERTY HOU HAD TO GO THROUGH DAVID L MAFITT HE LIVED ON THE LITTLE ISLAND WITH THES FAMILY THE PARK SERVICE HAS A HOUSE THERE GRY THE STATUE WAS RIGHT OUTSIDE HIS WINDOW HE FELTLI GT WAS HIS JOB TO PROTECT OR IAS ALMOST MEMBER OF THE FAMILY WHEN A DEODERANT MAKER TRIED TO USE HER IN AND ADD MAYBE BECAUSE SHE HAS HER ARM UP DAVID MAFFITT FOUGHT BACK WHEN A FURNITURE COMPANY WANTED TO HANG A COUCH FROM HER AND HAVE SOME ONE SIT IN THE COUCH HE VTOD IT AND WHEN DAVID COPPERFIELD REQUESTED PERMISSION TO MAKE HER DISAPPEAR HE SAID NO I PERSONALLY FELT THAT WAS A ANAPROLPRIET USE OF SUCH A SACRED I GONE AND I WROTE THAT TA REJECTION TO THE REQUEST AND I THOUGHT THAT PROBABLY WAS THE END OF IT BUT THE COPPER WEEKS LATER MAFFA GETS A LETTER IN THE MAIL FROM THE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE GIVING COPPERFIELD PERMISSION COPPERFIELD HAD GONE OVER HIS HEAD HE HAD CONNECTIONS I THE WHITE HOUSE COPPERFIELD'S TEEM DID CONFIRM THIS THEY SAID HE GOT PERMISSION DIRECTLY FROM RONALD RAKEN PUT IT MODLY I WAS A LITTLE BIT TAKEN BACK A FEW DAYS LATER A WAFKED AND OFFICE AND THERE DAVID COPPERFIELD HE STANDING UP THERE VERY ANDSON MIH LOOKING I WELL DRESSED COPPERFIELD APOLOGIZED FOR GETTING HIM OVER RULE MOFAT SAYS COPPERFIELD SEEMD SINCERE LIKE A NICE GOTT MA SIN TO PIRMIT AND TAN HE SAYS I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO SIN AWAYVER THAT SHE WILL NOT DISCLOSED HOW I MAKE TO SCATUE JUSTAPPEAR AS IS NO I WON'T DO THAT THAT A I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING THAT WOULD LEMINT MY FREEDOM OF SPEECH HARD TO ARGUE WITH THAT WAYER AT THE FOOT OF THE STTUE OF LIBERT MAFFA WAS THERE DURING THE FILMAE AND HE SAW HOW THE TRICK WAS DONT HE SAYS HE KEPT HIS MOUTH SHUT FOR THE LAST THREE DECADES ONLY TOLD FAMILY IN A FEW FRIENDS BUT HE CONFIRMD FOR ME THE EXPLANATION ON THE INTERNET THAT IS THE REAL EXPLANATION HE EVEN DEMONSTRATED FOR ME  WE GOT THE LACY SUS AN DID I USE FOR POTTERY THAT THAN COULD YOU GET THAT OR I'LL GET IT HE HAD A MINIATURE STATUE OF LIBERTY OF COURSE IT DAGE CHARCE TURNING HE AN IT GOES MAYBE TWENTY FAVE OR THIRTY DEGREES TO THE RIGHT DURING THE FILMING MAFFA WAS STANDING JUST OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE PLATFORM I FOUND ANOTHER GUY WHO WAS THERE AND WHO CONFIRMED THE BASIC MECHANICS OF HOW THE TRICK WAS DONE BUT TALKING TO HIMN MADE ME WONDER IF THERE MIGHT BE A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL OF THE STEPTUNE TO THE TRICK HIS NAME IS AL SERULA HIS NAME WAS IN THE CREDITS FOR THE SHOW HE FLEW A HELCOPTER IN THE VEAT NON MORE AND NOW FOR TVAN MOVIES SO MANY THE VENGERS SPIDER MAN MUPIT'S TAKE MANHAN THE ONE I WANE TO ASK YOU ABOUT WAS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES T WOULD BE PROBABLY CIRKQUENY TO ONE OF AS WER WE IT WAS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AT NIGHT HORK IT INVOLVE THE STATUE OF LIBERTY A WORKING GIRL NO WHEN DAVID COPPERFIELD MADE THE STATUE O TAVERIT COPPER OU YER YET I WAS A PRE GREAT DEAL ACTUI HE TOLD ME THE HELCOPTER'S JOB WAS TO FLY FROM POSITION A TO POSITION B WHILE THE CURTAIN WAS BLOCKING THE VIEW MISCALLY FROM ABOVE THE STATUE TO ABOVE A DESIGNATED EMPTY SPOT WHICH WAS RIGGED WITH DUPLICATE SPOT LIGHTS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE HELCOPTER AND THE LIGHTS ARE THE FIXED POINTS IN THE TRICK THE THINGS THAT MAKE THE AUDIENCE THINK THE'RE LOOKING AT THE SAME SPOT I DID THINK HE WAS ERE TO BEABLO O HOW CON W LIKE WHETWERE YOU WORRIED ABOUT HAPPENING BEE TL YOU SE OA PAGE MOERER WHATEVER THEY TREK A WOT WAT YO RAON  CAT A BARRING AND TAGE N I ON E BOTTOM SO THAT WUL OI HEY GOT AWAY TO COUPLE OF TIME YE CULD YOU KNOW WOR O WORKA RIGHT AND  COULDN'T GET IT TO WORK AT WHER HE WANTET HICH PUT THIS UN PLEASANT THOUGHT IN MY HEAD WAS THE AUDIENCE REALLY FOOL BY THIS WER WERE THEY MAY BE IN ON THE WHOLE TIME AH YET ZATRAY YET ADGI YES I SHOMER THE PEOPLE ON THE ARDIANCE FOR

OF THE SO CALLED AUDIENCE A HAW DID YOU AND UP HERE AND SHE SO I WAS PAID FOR THIS AND I WAS PAID TO COME HERE YE AND THAT WAS COUNT OF THE END OF THE CONVERSATION I WAS I DIDN'T THAT'S NOT I WASN'T INVESTIGATING I WAS JUST CURIOUS WORTHY PEOPLE CAME FROM A  SPECIALLY WHEN THE ACTUAL AMAZE AT IT WAS DISATHAT IT HAD DISAPPEARED BECAUSE THEY FELT THE STAGE MOTN THEY THEY COULDN'T HELP BUT FEELD THE STAGE MOVING DO YOU THINK THEY WERE ALL ACTORS I DON'T NOT THEY WERE ACTORS IR I WANTED TE AT I DON'T KNOW I KNOW THAT ONE OF TEM WAS PAID TO BE THERE MOFFITT WENT BACK OVER THIS IN HIS MEMORY BECAUSE HE WANTED TO BE ACCURATE HE LATER TOLD TUS HE THINKS IT WAS ONE OF HIS EMPLOYES WHO TALKED O THE WOMAN TO BE FAIR ITS BEEN OVER THIRTY YEARS BUT THIS THOUGHT THAT THE AUDIENCE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN ON ID IT MADE ME INCREDIBLY SAD IT FELT LIKE CHEATING IF ALL THOSE PEOPLE GOING WOW THEY WERE PAID TO GO WELL THEY WEREN'T FOOLED THAT'S NOT MAGIC THAT'S LIKE WE'RE WATCHING A PLAY ABOUT MAGIC I TOLD THE AMERICANS PRODUCERS JOE AND JOLD ABOUT THIS JOE THE FORMER CAD MAGICIAN DIDN'T SEE IT THE WAY I DID AT ALL IT MEANS HE BOUGHT OFF THE WHOLE AUDIENCE NO NO NO IT DOESN'T IT MIGHT MEAN THAT IT DOESN'T E LET'S SAY HE NO THE AUDIENCE WAS OS THE TALIVISIAN AUDIENCE IS THE AUDIENCE HE PROMISED TO MAKE THE STATUE OF LIBERTY DISAPPEAR WITH NO CAMMER TRICKS HE MADE THE STATUE LIBERTY DISVEA WITH NO CAMERTRICS IT'S MEFREE RO MATIC AND IT WAS MOVING I THINK IT'S LITTLE TROUBLING IF TRUE IF TRUE I HONESTLY DIDN'T KNO WAN TO BELIEVE I WATCH THE TEEVY SPECIAL AGAIN AND AG AN AND SOME OF THE AUDIENCE MEMBERS STARTED TO LOOK LIKE ACTORS AT LEAST IN MOMENTS LIK JUST AFTER THE CURTAIN DROPS AN THE STATUE WAS GONE THE S ONE GUY LEANS OVER TO THE WOMAN NEXT TO HIM ON POINTS AND THIS KIND OF HOKY RAY THEN THERE'S THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE AUDIENCE MEMBERS IS IN A PRIEST COLOR REALLY HE HPPEND TO GET A PRIEST IN THE AUDIENCE AND TO PRIEST DRESSED THAT WAY WHEN THEY GO OUT AT NIGHT FINALLY I GOT IT TOI I WAS AT THIS MAGIC SHOW TALKING TO THESE TWO  PEOPLE ONE OF THEM I'LL CALL A FORMER HIGH RANKING OFFICIAL IN THE MAGIC ESTABLISHMENT THEY KNEW SOME ONE WHO HAD BEEN THERE ON LIBERTY ISLAND DURING THE FILMING OF THE SHOW AND WOULD KNOW THE TRUTH I CALLED THE PERSON UP AND HE AGREED TO TALK MY NAME AS ETALONZO I'M KNOWN AS THE MISVIT OF MAGIC AND MAY BE REMEMBER ME AS MAX THE OWNER OF THE DINE ROOM SAY BY THE BELL EDD WAS ALSO THE GUY WHO MADE THAT CURTAIN GO UP AND DOWN IN FRONT OF THE STATUE OF LIBERTY ACTUALY THERE WERE TWO GUYS WAS A BIG CURT ED WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD THE TIME HA YOUNG MAGICIAN SAYD HE STAYED OVERNIGHT AT DAVID COPPERFIELD'S PARENTS HOUSE IN NEW JERSEY BEFORE THE SHUEDE I TOLD HIM IHAD HEARD THE AUDIENCE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN ON IT I TOLD HIM WHAT THE PARK SERVISGY HAD TOLD ME THAT AN AUDIENCE MEMBER HAD SAID SHE HAD BEEN PAID TO BE THERE REALLY SO I'M TOTALLY SURPRISED HEIT IS POSSIBLE THAT MAY BE SOME OF THE PEOPLE WERE PAID TO BE THERE ONLY BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET ENOUGH REGULAR PEOPLE WITH THE AMOUNT OF TICKETS THAT THEY GAVE OUT SOMETIMES YOU DO USE PAID EXTRAS IN AN AUDIENCE HE SAYS THEY SHOW UP ONE TIME AND HE CAN TELL HIM THE DRESS NICELY BUT EVEN IF THEY WERE PAID PEOPLE THEY WOULD HAVE NOT OF KNOWN HOW THE TRICK WAS DONE IT WAS NO REASON FOR FOR ANY ONE TO KNOW AHAD A TIME COPPERFIELD'S TEAM BY THE WAY SAYS NO AUDIENCE MEMBERS WERE PAID THEY SAID THE WOMAN WHO CLAIM SHE WAS PAID TO BE THERE MUST HAVE BEEN ON THE PRODUCTION STAFF AND EDD SAYS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK WAS DONE TO MAKE SURE THE TRICK WOOLD FOOL PEOPLE EDD DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT OR CONFIRMD THE MECHANICS OF THE TRICK BUT HE SAID THEY DID A WHOLE DRY RUN BEFOREHAND OUT IN LOST ANGELIS THE IDEA TO MAKE THE STATUE OF LIBERTY DISAPPEAR CAME FROM AN ILLUSION DESINER NAMED JIM STEINE BYER COPPERFIELD'S TEAM WITH THE HELP OF A GUY NAME DON WANE ATAT ALL KINDS OF IMPROVEMENTS AND BUILT THE STAGE AS A TEST THEY USED IT TO MAKE THE MOON DISAPPEAR THEY SAID THE STAGE A BASICALLY IN HIS PARKING LOT HTHE YOU WE WERE IN A PARKIN LICAUSE THE THE STAGE WAS ENORMOUS DAVID THOUGHT THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DO KIND OF A DEMONSTRATION TO WORK OUT THE BUGS BEFORE WE HALL THIS THING TO NEW YORK A BUTCH OF TOP MAGICIANS IN ALLE SAT ON THE STAGE COPPERFIELD MADE THE MOON DISAPPEAR AND EVERYONE GAVE NOTES TWEEKS TO MAKE IT BETTER S EHE COULD FOOL A REAL AUDIENCE EDD SAYS THE NIGHT OF THE FILMING AT THE STATUE OF LIBERTY IT WAS CLEAR TO HIM THAT THE PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WERE A FOOL I ASKED HIM WHY IN A COUPLE SHOTS THE AUDIENCE SEEMED A LITTLE FAKE TO ME HE HAD A RETTY GOOD EXPLANATION WHICH IS THAT THEY FILMED THE TRICK MULTIPLE TIMES COPPERFIELD'S TEAM OFFICIALLY DENIES THIS EDD SAYS IT SO THOUGH I THINK THAT MAY BE AFTER WE DIDIT ABOUT THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE SITTING ON THIS PLATFORM MAY HAVE HAD AN IDEA AS TO WHAT WAS GOING I GRILLED ED FOR AN HOUR ABOL AND FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH I BELIEVE IN WHEN HE SAYS THE AUDIENCE WAS NOT INNOLN HOUGH I DO HAVE THIS TINY SLIVER OF DOW WHICH I HAVE TO SAY I KIND OF ENJOY THE FELIOUT DAVID COPPERFIELD TOLD US HE WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT WE WANTED DO OUR STORY ON A TRICK THATIS OVER THIRTY

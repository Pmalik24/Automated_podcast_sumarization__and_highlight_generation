MEANTHAT THEY'RE ALL SEEING AND THERE JUST PRETENDING THEY DON'T SEE IT AND YOU CAN ONLY PRETEND THAT REALITY DOESN'T EXIST FOR SO LONG BEFORE EVEN YOUR TYPICAL VOTERS STARK TO TURN ON YOU AND THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH REGARD TO EMIGRATION AND JOBIDON WHICH AGAIN HE IS LOSING THAT ISSUE BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS HIS ONLY RESPONSE TO THIS IS GOING TO BE ABORTION BY THE WAY HE'S NOT GOING TO EVEN DEAL WITH EMIGRATION ISSUE THE EMIGRATION ISSUES SJUST IN A SIMMER THE ENTIRE YEAR HE'S INSTEAD GOING TO REDIRECT ED ABORTION AND TRY TO GET SUBURBAN WOMEN TO VOT AGAINST ONALD TRUMP BASED ON THERE SUPPOSE IT NEED FOR AN ABORTION DESPITE THE FACT THAT SUBURBAN WOMEN ARENACTUALLY HAVING THAT MANY ABORTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AT THIS POINT AN TIME BUT THE EMIGRATION ISSUE FOR A HUGE NUMBE OF AMERICANS IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO GROW INSIDES AS WELL IT SHOULD BY THE WAY ALL IT WOULD TAKE IS GOD FORBID ONE SERIOUS TERRORIST ATTACK BYNIN LEGALIMIGRANT CROSSING AMERICA SOUTHERN BORDER WHICH THERE ARE COUNTRIES THAT AREATTEMPTING TO FUNNEL TERRORIST ACROSS AMERICA SOUTHERN BORDER GIVEN THAT IT IS WIDE OPEN AT THIS POINT ALL IT WOULD TAKE IS A SERIOUS ATTACKED COMPLETELY SHIFT THE NATURE OF AMERICAN POLITICS PERHAPS FOR A GENERATION BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT WE'VE AMERICA THAT THE GREAT PROMISE OF AMERICO IS FREE MARKETS AND SECURITY JUST IN TERMS OF WHAT THE GOVERNMEN IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE YOU PROPERTY RIGHTS AND SECURITY THOSE OF THE THINGS THAT AMERICA HISTORICALLY HAS DONE INCREDIBLY WELL O FEELS LIKE BOTH OF THOSE THINGS ARE IN DANGER THAT SOMETHING THAT AMERICANS ARE NOT GOING TO REACT WELL TO ACCORDING TO THE NEW BLOOMBURG SWING STATES POLE THE QUESTION WAS HOW RESPONSIBLE IF AT ALL IS PRESENT IMBIDON FOR THE INCREASE IN MIGRANS CROSSING THE OSE MEXICAL BORDER SIXTY ONE PER CENTS AY RESPONSIBLE ONLY TWENTY NINE PER CENT SAY NOT RESPONSIBLE THAT BY THE WAY INCLUDES THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF DEMOCRATS WHO SAY THE JOBIDON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HUGE INCREASE ANY LEGLEMIGRATIONS BORDER THAT INCLUDE FIFTY NINE PER CENTS OF HIS PANNICS FORTY SEVEN PER CENT O BLACKS AS SUPPOSE O THIRTY SIX PERCENT WHO SAY THAT HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THAT FIFTY TO PER CENT OF AMERICANS TRUST DONALD TRUMPIN EMIGRATION COMPARED TO THIRTY PER CENT OF AMERICANS TRUSTING JOBIDON BY THE WAY ON THE ECONOMY THE UMBERS ARE FAIRLY SIMILAR ONDTHE ECONOMY TRUMPEITS TRUSTED BY FIFTY ONE PERCENT IS IN THE SWING STATES FIRST THIRTY THREE PERCENT FOR JOBIDON SERAINT NOW YOUR SEING SOME NATIONAL POLLING DATA THAT SUGGESTING THA BIDON HAS OPEN UP A LEAD IN IN A HEAD TO HEAD QUINIPIAC UNIVERSITY PUT OUT A POLE YESTERDAY THEY PUT OUT THIS POLE AND THEY SHOW A LEAD OF BIDNA SIGNIFICANT LEAD A FIFTY TO FORTY FOUR PER CENT LEAD AMONG REGISTERED VOTERS AND A HYPOTHETICAL GENERAL ELECTION MACTRO NOUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE TO REGISTERED VOTERS AND LIKELY VOTERS LIKELY VOTERPOLES TEN TO BE BETTER REGISTER VOTERPOLES TEN TO BE WORS THE REASON IS BECAUSE AGAIN A THET A LOT REGISTER VOTERS WARE SIMPLY NOT GOING TO VOTE THE UP COMING ELECTION TIS TH BIG PROBEM FOR JOBIDON HE ONE WHEN YOU HAVE THE BIGGEST SPIKE IN ELECTION VOTES IN AMERICAN HISTORY WHEN THE NUMBER OF VOTES IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SHIFTS BY EXTRAORDINARY PER CENTAGES IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THEREARE PROXIMATLY A HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION VOTERS AND THEREABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION VOTES CAST IN TWENTY TWENTY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN A HUNDRED D FIFTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE SHUT UP TO VOTING TWENTY TWENTY A HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLIN PEOPLE THAT IS AN INCREASE OF AGAIN LIKE EIGHTEEN TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE IN ONE ELECTION CYCLE THAT IS NOT ONREPLICATE THIS TIME IT'S GOING TO TURN OUT IS CON BE DOWN IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IT WILL MAINLY BECAUSE ALL OF THE VOTING WOLLS RE IN A SHIFT BACK TO NORMAL AND A LOTOF PEOPLE CAN BE EXPECTED TO YOU KNOW GOD TO A POLLING PLACE IN ACTUALLY VOTE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET PEOPLE VOTING FIVE MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF THE ELECTION BY MAIL SOMETHING LIKE SIXTY PER CENTS OVALL DEMOCRATIC VOTERS IN T E LAST ELECTION YCAL VOTED BY MA THAT IS NOT GOING TO REPLICATE THIS TIME SO WHILE YOUR SEEING A LOT OF POLES THAT ARE STARTING TO EMERGE NATIONALLY IN THE STATES DONAL TRUMP DOS IN FACT RETAN A LEAD DONALD AND THAT LEAD IS GOING TO BE DURABLE SO LONG AS JOBITON CONTINUES TO DESTROY THE SITUATION ON THE BORDER AND HE IS DOING THAT SINGLE HANDEDLY BY THE WAY THIS IS ONE REASON THE BORDER DEAL IS ON LIFE SUPPORT IF REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS A A CHANCE THAT JOBIDON WAS GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE BORTER IF JOBI NACTULLY JUST TO DAY CAMMOUNTIUSILISCEM WER DON'G REMAIN A MEXICO AND WE ARE ALSO GOING TO MAKE SURE THE IFFOU HAVE AN ASYLUM APPLICATION THEY YOU HAVE TO STAY INTO TENTION UNTIL THAT IS JUDICATED IF JOBIDE MADE THOSE TWO CHANGES TO DAY THE CHANCE OF A BORDER DEAL WOULD GO UP SIGNIFICANTLY NOT JUST BECAUSE REPUBLICANS MIGHT THEN BELEAD THAT THEY HAD SOMETHING LIKE A CREDIBLE PARTNER IN SHUTTING THE BORDER AND MAINTAINING A BORDER AT ALL BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE POLITICAL IN CENTIVES WHICH WOULD WITCH THEN WHO ID MOVE FROM IF THERE IS A COMPROMISE ON THE BORDER THAT BALES JOBITEN OUT TO IF THERE'S A COMPROMISE ON THE BORDER THAT SHIFTS THE LAW IN A DIRECTION THAT WE LIKE THAT IS A SEMENTING OF ACTIONS THAT JOBIDNES ARE TY TAKEN WHAT RE PUBLICANS ARE ARE AFRAID OF IS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO SIGN ON TO A BORDER DEAL AND JOBIDON IS THEN ONE THO ABSOLUTELY SCREW THEM IN TERMS OF THE EXECUTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT DEAL AND THEY ARE RIGHT TO BE PRIRTICLARLY FRIGHTENED OF THAT WHEN HE SEELL THESE REPUBLICANS ON EARS WHO ARE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW SAYING THINGSABOUT THE BILL BIL SO GREAT IN THIS WE HAVE NOT YET SEEN THE TEXT OF THE BILL I CAN'T AJUDICATE WHETHER I THINK THE BILL IS GOOD OR TELL YOU WHETHER I THINK THE BILL IS GOOD UN

MARCH EARLY OLIC BEFORE EVEN IS RAILLY RETALIGATION FOR THE TERROR ATTACK IN WHICH THERE WERE ACTUAL TERRIFLAXH BING FLON IS RESOLVED NOT ONLY T WITH HOLD HIS VOTE FROM BIDON BUT TO ACTIVELY CAMPAIGN AGAINST HIM SOME MICHIGAN ARABS AND MUSLEMS HAVE LAUNCHE IN ABANTON BIDIN CAMPAIGN PART OF A BROADER NATIONAL MOVEMENTS STILL GETTNG OFF THE GROUND TO INSURE THOSE IN THEIR COMMUNITYSHIP TO CAST THEIR

THE YELLING AND SO HE HAS DECIDED APPARENTLY HE AND HIS STATESPARTMENT ARE TRYING TO ICIDE ON A NEW STRATEGY A NEW STRATGY FOR THE MIDDLE EAST THIS STRATEGE INVOLVES FULL SCALE SURRENDER TWO TERROR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE FULL SCALE NO STOPS SURRENDER WILL GET TO THAT MOMENTARILY FIRST SUP YELL DO MEAN TO FLECTS ON YOU WE ALL KNOW I'M THE NUMBR ONE RAPPER IN THE WORLD THI KES TO FACTS BY TOM MC DONALD AND ME YOU KNOW JU PAK THE NOTORIOUS B N DOCTOR DRADEL THE LEADER OF THE JUTANG CLAN NOW IT'S NO QUESTION THA WHEN I DROPPED ON THE SCENE WITH THAT FACT SHOODY I ATE NAN AN ANALICLIS A BELIKE MY THREADS WERE FIR IF YOU WANT YOUR DRIP TO BE BUST IN MY GY YOU HAVE TO COP THIS HOODIE IMMEDIATELY NO CAP  MUSTER JEWISH WHEN YOU WEAR THIS HOODIE YOU'LL ROAST THE LEFT AND RIS THE REST THE FACTS

SLASH SHOP TO BUY YOUR FACTS HOODIE O DAY THE MOST COVETED PIECE OF CLOTHING ON THE PLANET HURRY THESE HOODIES ARE SO GOADED WITH THE SAUCE THE BE SOLD OUT QUICKER AND I SPIT BARS O CAM MEANWHILE SO WHAT IS JOBITON'S ATIALM AT A LEASTERN POLICY NOW NOW TO PREEMPTIVE SURRENDER SO THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS APPARENTLY NOW ACCORDING TO BARACH RAVIDE REPORTING FOR ACTIOS THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS NOW BEING ASKED BY THE SECRETERSTATE TONTY BLANCAN TO CON DUCT A REVIEW AND PRESENT POLICY OPTIONS ON POSSIBLE YOUESS AN INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION OF A PALISTINIAN STATE AFTER THE WAR IN GAZA ACCORDING TO TWO ES OFFICIALS BRIEFED ON THE ISSUE THAT'S INSANG I' M EXPLAIN WHY THAT IS INSANG THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT THE PALSIN AN AUTHORITY DOES NOT EVEN GOVERN THE WESBANK IT HAS THE APROVAL OF ZERO PER CENT OF THE PALSNIAN POPULATION BY POLLINGTDAD IS NON ZERO BUT IT'S VERY CLOSE TO ZERO WHICH IS WHY MACHMOOD BAS THE EIGHTY EIGHT YEAR OLD CLEPTOCRAT WHO IS STOLEN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM HIS OWN PEOPLE SAME THNG WITH THISMILHONEA OVER IN COMASLAND AS LIVING AT FIVE STAR HOTELS AND CUTTAR WHILE THE REST OF HIS PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN RUBBLE BUT THE PALSINIAN AUTHORITY IT DOES NOT HAVE THE APPROVAL OFTONE PEOPLE BACHMOODBAS IS CURRENTLY IN THE IF MY MOUTH IS CORRECT NINETEENTH YEAR OF A FOR YEAR TERM THE LAST ELECTION THA WAS HELD THT WAS I BELIEVE TWO THOUSAND SIX IN THE WESTBANK AND IT WAS RIGGED IN FAVOR OF MACHMOODBAS THAT COMMAS WULD NOUT WIN AND HEU STILL SERVING AS QUONQUOTE PRESIDENT HE ALSO HAPISTO BE A HALICOSTO NYING JUHATOR WHO IS WALKED WAY FROM THE TABLE ON MULTIPLICATIONS WHEN PRESENTED WITH A PIECIAL MOST RECENTLY BY A HOOD OLMAR MOST GENEROUS PIECIOL EVER OFFERED TO THE PALSONIANS YHOU SIMPLY WALKED AWAY FROM THE TABLE MO COUNTER OFFER THAT IS ONE PARITY IN BE GOVERNING STRUCTURE OF THE PALISTINIAN OUTH OF T PALSTINIAN AREAS OTHER GOVERNING STRUCTURES IS LOMATYHOT A FULLON TERRAGROUP COME OSS A FILLON TERRAGROUP THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT THERE'S NO GOVERNMENT NOT ONLY THAT THERE IS NO TERATORIAL BORDER NO BORER HAS BEEN DECIDED UPON IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE WESTBANK IT LOOKS LIKE IN ANDY WARHALL PAINTING IT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE THE REASON IT'S ALL OVER THE PLACES CAUSE YOUHAVE INTER MIXED POPULATIONS BECAUSE THERE HAD NEVER BEEN ANY SORT OF STATI SETTLEMENT AFTER THE SIXTY SEVEN WAR NOW MEMBER BETWEEN NINETEEN FORTY AND NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN THE ARAB'S CONTROLLED THE WEST BANK AND THE GASASTRIP JORN CONTROL BELUS BANK THE GASTRIP WAS CONTROL BY EGYPT AT NO POINT ID EGYPT TRIED TO CRAE TO PALISTINIAN STATE IN THE GOSE STRIP AND AT NO POINT TO JORGAN TRY TO PRAT TO PALISTONIAN STATE IN THE WEST BANK THE ARABS DON'T CARE ABOUT A PALISTONIAN STATE ANY OF THESE AREAS IN FACT THEY KNO FUL WELL THAT IF A PALISTONIAN STATE WERE TO BE CREATED THESE AREAS IT WOLD IMMEDIATELY BE A TERROR STATE DIRECTED AT THEM THE JORDANIANS ARE NOT REALLY IN FAVOR OF A PATEN INDEPENDENT PALISTONIAN STATE GOVERNED BY THE PALISTONIAN AUTHORITY O COMMAS THT IS A DIRECT THREAT TO THE HASH MIGHTE REGIME IN JORDAN THE EGYPTIANS DON'T WANT A PALISTONIAN STATE IN THE GOSISTRIP THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE A BORDER WALL THAT MAKES ISRAEL'S BORDER WILL LOOK LIKE NOTHING THAT SO CALLED RAFA GATE DOWN THE BORE BETWEEN EGYPT AND THE GASASTRIP IN OTHER WORDS A PALISTNIAN STATE NOMBER ONE IS IN NO ONE'S INTEREST IN THE REGION LITERALLY NO ONE A PAW INCLUDING THE PALISTONINS BECAUSE THERE GOVERNING STRUCTURE WOULD NOT EXIST IT WOULD BE GARBAGE AND IT WOULD FOMENT TERRORISM AND LEAD TO FULLSCALE WAR IF A PALISTNIAN STATE WERE ACTUALLY TO EXIST AND THEN THEY WERE TO ATTACK ISRAEL ISRA WOULD HAVE NO HUMANITARIAN OBLIGATIONS AT ALL BECAUSE NOW YOU ARE AT WAR DIRECTLY WITH ANOTHER SOVEREIGN STATE AT THAT POINT ALL BETS ARE OFF BUT THE WORST THING FOR THE PALISTONIANS WOULD BE TO HAVE A PALISTONIAN STATE GOVERN BY EITHER OF THE P A OR COMMASS THERE IS NO GOVERNING STRUCTURE SO SAYING THAT YOU ARE GOING TO PREREMPTIVELY TO CLARA PALISTONIAN STATE WITH NO BORDERS NO GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE NO POWER POWERFUL ENOUGH TO EVEN GOVERND THE AREAS THAT ARE SUPPOSEDLY GOVERNED AND NO RATIONAL FOR WYD THIS STATE WOULD SOMEHOW MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE MORE SOLID WHY THIS PLACE WOULD BE GOVERNED IN ALLEGIANCE TO ANYTHING LIKE FUNDAMENTALLY DECENT PRINCIPLES AS SUPPOSE YOU JUST BECOMING A HORRIFYING CHEREA LAW STATE WHICH IS WHAT COMMOSS WANTS FOR EXAMPLE WHAT THE HELL IS JOBIDAN THINKING WHAT THE HALLIS HE THINKING AND MEAN IT'S CRAZY NOT ONLY IS IT STUPID AND MORALLY BENIGHTED IT ALSO HAPPENS TO BE UTTERLY UNREALISTIC I MAY AS WELL DECLARE A STATE OF CHI PEROSTAND SOMEWHERE IN SALTHY STASIA I'RE NOMANY TERRITORIA HOLDINGS THERE I DON'T THE BORDERS ARE THER'S NO GOVERNMENT THAT'S PROVE BY THE PEOPLE THERE BUT SURE I'MEN I WHYSH WHY NOT MANSURE LIKE WELL JUST ACLARE A STATE OFSHIP PEROSTAND IT HAS ALL OF THE SAME QUALITIES AS A QUONN WHAT STATE O PALISTIN NO GOVERNMENT NO GOVERNMENT CAPABLE OF HOLDING TERRITORY NO GOVERNMENT CAPABLE OF GOVERNING PEOPLE AND NO RATIONAL FOR EXISTING PERSAY BUT SURE LIKE IT'LL BE GREAT IT'LL BE RET BY THE WAY NOTICE THE PRIORITYE SERE FROM THE BY DMENSTRATION MET IE EAN INDEPENDENT CURTESTAND I NOTICED NOT ARE TOMAN INDEPENDENT SOMALI LAND I NOTICE NOT ON ON THE LIST OF P A OF PEOPLES WHO DESERVE A STATE RIGHT NOW IN THE SENSE THAT THE STATE WLASHING NOTBEA THREAT TO WESTERN INTERESTS AN WILL NOT BE A FULL ON FOMENTING TERROR STATE THE PALISTONIAN STATE IDEA COMES LIKE DEAD LAST IT'S REALLY LOW ON THAT PRIORITIALIST SO WHY EXACTLY IS JOBIN DOING ALL THIS AND THEYRE WO REASONS ONE AGAIN IS TO PLEASE HIS LEFT WING DOMESTIC BATE AND THE OTHER REASON IS BECAUSE THE THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS FILLED WITH MOREONS AND THE'S MOREONS HAVE A PECULIAR BELIEF THAT IF YOU SIMPLY GIVE TERRORUS WHAT THEY WANT THAN THEY WILL BE NICE TO YOU AND THAT SOMEHOW THIS WILL FOMENT PEACE IN THE REGION READING THE WAY AMONG THESE MORONS AS TOM IS FREED EN THOMAS FREEDMENT IS TRULY THE STUPIDEST PERSON TO WRITE ON FOREIN POLICY IN MY LIFETIME IT IS NOT PARTICULARLY CLOSE THOMAS FREEDMENS ENTIRE BAG IS WHAT IF I TRAVEL AROUND GET LIND AND DINED BY RANDEM REGIMES AN THE RIGHT ROSY ROSE COLORED GLASSIS VIEWS OF THESE AWFUL RECHIMED HE'S DONE WITH A RINDIT WITH CHINA I'LL GO ALL OVER THE PLACE I'L BE WINE AND DINE BY THESE VERIOUS RECIMES AND THAT'S WHAK ATAXY DRIVERS AND THOSE TAY DRIVERS WILL WILL BESTOW THEIR WISDOM UPON ME AND THEN I WILL GO AND MEET WITH JOBIDOAN HELPE TO FIND HITS FORM POLICY SHE HAS A PIEACE TODAY TIDLE A BIDON DOCTRINE FOR THE MIDDLEAST IS FORMING AND IT'S BIG SO WHAT EXACTLY WITH THIS BIDAN DOCTRINE BEING HE SAYS ON ONE TRACK WOULD BE A STRONG AND RESOLUTE STAND ON ARON INCLUDING A ROBUST MILITARY RETALIATION AGAINST ORONS PROXIES AND AGENTS IN THE REGION IN RESPONSE TO THE KILLING OF THREE OU US SOLDIERS AT A BASIN JORDAN BY A DRONE APPARENTLY LAUNCH BY A PROORONIAN MILITIA IN AROCK ECASE THAT HASN'T MATERIALIZED AT ALL THERE HAS BEEN NO HARSH RESPONSE BY THE BY DIMINISTRATION TO THE MURDER OF THREE AMERICAN SOLDIERS IN JORDAN NONE ZERO THERE SAYING THERE IS STROING LIKE DRONE ALETS AHH NOW WE BELIEVE YOU YOU'VE HIGH LEVELS OF CREDIBILITY I'M SURE THAT YOU'VE JUST  YET I'M SURE I'M SURE NOT USTATING A CAMEL IN THE ASS OR BLOWING UP AN EMPTY BUILDING I'M SURE JOBIDON IS IS TAKING HARSH MEATUR ON THE SECOND TRACK SAYS THOMAS RYMEN WOULD BE AN UNPRECEDENTED YOU US DIPLOMATIC INNITIATIVE TO PROMOTE A PALISTONIAN STATE NOW IT WOULD INVOLVE SOME FORM OF YUSE RECOGNITION OF A DEMILITORIZED PALISTONIAN STATE IN THE WESTBANK AN GOSESTRIP THAT WOUL COME IN TO BEING ONLY ONCE PALISTONIANS HAVE DEVELOPED A SET OF DEFINE CREDIBLE INSTITUTIONS AND SECURITY CAPABILITIES TO INSURE THAT THE STATE WAS VIABLE AND THAT IT CULD NEVER THREATEN ISRAEL OH WELL I MEAN UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS I'M SURE PALISTONIAN STAPING PURSUED RIGHT NOW IS DEFINITELY GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN UNICORNS ARE FARDING ENERGY SURE THAT TAT'SEUMGS LIKE THAT'S RIGHT AROUN THE CORN BY THE WAY THE THE MESSAGE THAT JOBIDON AN TH SATES PARMEN OUR SENNING RIGHT NOW BUT JUST LOOK AT THE TIME LINE HERE JOBDON IN THE STATES PARTMEL WERE NOT PUSHING THE IMMEDIATE RECOGNITION OF A PALISTONIAN STATE BECAUSE ITS IDIOCY THEN OCTOBER SEVENTH HAPPENES TWELVE HUNDRED JEWS GET MURDERED AND NOW THE BI DMINISTRATIONS LIKE WHAT IF WE JUS GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT SO WHAT WHAT IS THAT SAY WHAT S THE MESSAGE THE MESSAGES IF YOU KILL ENOUGH JEWS JOBIDON WILL GIVE YOU A STATE THAT IS THE ACTUAL MESSAGE THE ACTUAL MESSAGEIS IF OU MURDER ENOUGH JEWS JOBIDON WI'LL CONSILIATE TO YOUR POSITION HOW DIS THAT STRENGTH IN THE WEST EXACTLY SERIOUSLY HOW IS THAT GOOD FOUR AMERICA HOW'S A GOOD ILEC BECAUSE THE SAME LOGICOL APPLIE TO AMERICANS PRESUMABLY THAT IF HE KILL ENOUGH AMERICANS JOBIDOENWIL JUS GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT IS  IS THE MOST APPEASEMEN ORIENT TO PALIS HAVE EVER EVEN REMOTELY HERD OF COME OSS MURDERS TWELVE HUNDRED JEWS THE PALISONIAN AUTHORITY HAS ON ITS BOOKS LAWS THAT PAID PEOPLE WHO MURDER JEWS AND THE BIDMINISTRATIONS LIKE WHAT IF WE UPHOLD THE YOU AND AUR DBLE YOU ITE WHICH THE COMOSS FRONT GROUP WHAT IF WE ACTUALLY LIKE GIVE THE PALISTONIAN AUTHORITY A STATE WHAT IF WE DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT'L BE GREAT ACCORDING TO THOMAS FREEDMEN BIDE ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN CONSULTING EXPERTS INSIDE AN OUTSIDE YOU US GOVERNMENT ABOUT DIFFERENT FORMS UT THIS RECOGNITION OF PALISTONIAN STATEHOOD MIGHT TAKE HASO AGAIN NO EXPERT CAN SIMPLY WISHCAST A PALISTONIAN STATE THAT IS MODERATE AND NOT A THREAT TO ITS NEIGHBORS INTO EXISTENCE THEY TRIED TO WISH C ASTED INTO EXISTENCE DURING THE OSLOW CORDS THAT WAS LITERALLY THE OSLOW CORDS AND FOR THIRTY YEARS WE'VE WE'VE OPERATED IN THE MIDDLE EAST UNDER THIS DELUSION AND IT'S A STUPID ASCININE FOOLISH NINCOMPOOPISH IDEA RIDICULOUS ON THE THIRD TRACK ACCORDING TO THOMAS REMAN WOULD BE A VASTLY EXPANDED YOU US SECURITIA LINES WITH SOUTYARABIA WHICH OARE ALSO INVOLVE SOUTY NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL IF THE IS REALLY GOVERNMENT IS PREPARED TO EMBRACE A DIPLOMATIC PROCESS LEADING TO IT MILITRIZED PALISONIAN STATE WLED BY A TRANSFORM PALISTONIAN AUTHORITY WELL OKA AGAIN WHEN THE RAINBOWS FAR WHEN WHEN THE UNICORNS FAR RAINBOWS I GUESS THAT WERE THERE IF THE ADMINISTRATION CAN PULL THIS TOGETHER A HUGE IFF A BIDING DOCTRINE COULD BECOME THE BIGGESTRATEGIC REALINEMENT IN THE REGION SINCE THE NINETY SEVEN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE CAMP DAY V TREATY WELL AND AND IF I COULD AND IF I COULD SOMEHOW SOLVE THE PROBLEM COLD FUSIAN ENERGY WOULD BE FREE WHAT BUT BY THE WAY WHAT'S AMAZING ABOUT THOMAS REEMAN'S IDIOT PLAN WHICH IS NOW BEING EMBRACED AGAIN BY THE IDIOT BY D ADMINISTRATIO OF YUSE LORD T IDIOT HEROLOPIC TRULY THESE PEOPLE ARE ARE MENTALLY DEFICIENT THE WHAT WHAT SO FUNNY ABOUT THIS IS THAT YOU KNOW PURSUED TWO OF THESE THREE TRACTS AND WAS SUCCESSFUL DONAL TRUMP YOU KNOW LASHE TOOK HARSH ANTIRONIAN ACTION DONAL TRUMP HE KILLED CUSTAM SOLEMONI THE HAD OF THE ALKOODS FORCEHE PUT THE HARSHEST SANCTIONS IN AMERICAN HISTORY ON ARON A NO DID IT CONTAINED ARON HE MADE CLEAR THAT IF A RON CROSSED LINES THEY WOULD GET CLOCKED IN THE FACE A NODERONDID THEY SHOT UP MEANWHILE YOURE CALL THE TRUM AMINISTRATION MADE WARM OVERTURES TOWARD THE SOUTIES AND TOWARD THE UA EON  BAHRAIN AN DOR MOROCO A YOT THEY DID THEYLL MAY PIECE OFT ITZREL AND SOWD HE WAS GOIN TO DO IT TOO IN OTHER WORDS THE SCENTRALITY OF THE PALISTINIANS TO ANYTHING REMOTELY LIKE PIECE IN THE IDLE EAST IS NOT ONLY A LY IT IS A PERNICIOUS AND COUNTER PRODUCTIVE Y BUT THAT'S EXACTLY DO BIDE ADMINISTRATION IS NOW EMBRACING WHY BECAUSE THEY ARE SO WETTED TO THEIR OWN STUPID FORM POLICY THEY CAN'T SEPARATE THEMSELVES FROM A NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO THEY'RE GETING BLACK MAIL BY THEIR OWN VOTING BAS IN THEY DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH OF CHARACTER TO RECOGNIZE THAT ACTUALLY NOT SUPPORTING TERROR REGIMES IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF STATE MIGHT BE GOOD POLICY MEANWHILE ET YELAN MUSK HAS COME UNDER FIRE BECAUSE ELAN MUSK IS NOT OF THE LEFT A ELAN MUSK IS THE MOST CREATIVE ONTROPERNOR OF OUR TIME BY FAR WHICH DVICED THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD HE START A MULTIPLICITY OF UNBELIEVABLY INTERESTING COMPANIES RANGING FROM TESSLA WHICH IS A GREAT COMPANY TO SPASACS WHICH IS IN MY OPINION EVEN A GREATER COMPANY A E HES IS SIMPLY A SINGULAR FIGURE IN MODERN WESTERN WIFE IS IS AN INCREDIBLE FIGURE WHICH IS WHY PEOPLEARE COMING AFTER HIM THEY ARE ALL FINE WITH HIM HE WAS HE WAS THE ONTROPANORE WHO IS INTERESTING AND FASCINATING AND QIRKY AN ALL OF THE STUFF UNTIL THE POINT HE BOUGHT ACTS AS SOON AS HE STARTED MAKING SOUNDS THAT HE LIKED FREE SPEECH AND WANTED TO OPEN UP THE AUSPICIES OF OF SOCIAL MEDIA TWO VARIOUS ALL TURN OF OPINIONS THE WORLD CAME DOWN AROUND HIS EARS AND SO WHAT WE ARE WATCHING RIGHT NOW IS A POLITICAL BICE AGAINST ELON MUSK TURNED INTO A LEGAL BICE AGAINST ELAON MUSK THE LEGAL SYSTEM WHEN WE TALK BY THE LEGAL SYSTEM BEING PERVERTED I MEAN THIS IS A NATURAL PERVERSION OF TE LEGAL SYSTEM SO ACCORDING TO FOX BUSINESS A DELAWARE JUDGE RULED IN FAVOR OF TESSLA IN VESTORS WHO SUED TO CHALLENGE A FIFTY SIX BILLION DOLLAR PAYPACKAGE FOR ELA MUS THE DECISION DARES TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE OR LEAST WHERE NO DELAWARE COURT HAS TREAD THE OPINION STATES THE COLLECTION OF FEATURE'S CHARACTERIZING MUSK'S RELATIONSHIP WITH TESSLAND ITS DIRECTORS GAVE HIM ENORMOUS INFLUENCE OVER TESSLA IN HER RULING THE JUDGE SAID QUHAT THE PLAINTIVEIS ENTITLED TO RECISION MEANING THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS TESTLA SUED TO BASTELY CAWL BACK A FIFTY SIX BILLION DOLLAR PAYPACKAGE TO MUSKELL GET INTO THE PAYPCKG IN A SECONDS OF SIS BIGGES PAYPACKAGE ANYBOD'S EVER HEARD OF WHY DID THAT HAPPEN AL GET INO THEN A SECOND SHOE DIRECTED THE TWO PARTIES TO CONFER ON A FINAL FORM OF ORDER TO IMPLEMENT HER DECISION AND SUBMIT A JOINT LETTER IDENTI FYING ALL ISSURES INCLUDING FEES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED TO BRING THE MATTER TO CONCLUSION AT THE TRIAL LEVEL SHE ADDED THAT TESSELL WAS PUT UNABLE TO PROVE THAT THE STOCKHOLD OR VOTE WAS FULLYIN FORMM BECAUSE THE PROXY STATEMENT INACCURATELY DETAE DESCRIBED KEY DIRECTORS IS INDEPENDENT AND MISLEADINGLY OMITTED DETAILS ABOUT THE PROCESS NOW THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE PAYPACKAGE THAT MUSK NEGOTIATED WITH TESSLA WAS WIDELY TERIDE IT AT THE TIME AS BASICALLY EMPTY VERBIAGE THAT WOULD NEVER MATERIALIZE BECAUSE EFFECTIVELY SPEAKING MUSK DEFERRED ALL COMPENSATION TO A FUTURE PAY PACKAGE TIED TO THE INCREASE IN THE STOCK VALUATION OF TESSLA PLUS EARNINGS THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED AND EVERYBODY KNEW ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT WAS H MOST WIDELY REMARKED UPON C E O THIS IS  IS MOST WIDELY REMARKED UPON C E O PAY PACKAGE LITERALLY IN HUMAN HISTORY SO TESSEL'S AGREEMENT WITH MUSK IS THE LARGEST COMPENSATION EVER PROVIDED TO AN EXECUTIVE TO MAJOR FACTOR AND MAKING ONE O THE WORLD'S WEALTHIEST INDIVIDUALS SO WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT HE WASN'T GUARANTEE ANY SALARY THIS IS COMMENTED UPON BY ANDREW RO SORK AND BACK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND HERE'S WHAT HERO JUST TO MAKE CLEAR WHAT THE JUDGE IS DOING JUDGEIS TATES MUSKIN SO AS DECIDED TO SCRUB BUT HERE'S WAT AT WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPEN HERE QUOTE TESTLA'S ELAN MUSK MAY HVE THE BOLDEST PAY PLANTIN CORPERT HISTORY FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THERE'S BEEN SPECULATION ABOUT ELAN MUSK'S FUTURE AT TESSLA AND WHETHER HE WOULD STEP DOWN AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE IN THE NEXT YEAR OR TOO MISTER MUSS STOKE TO THAT SPECULATION AS FAR BACK AS FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN HE SAID HE WANTED TO STAYE THROUGH THE INTRODUCTION OF THE MODEL THREE AND THEN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN HE SAID I'LL HAVE TO SE YOU KNOW HOW THINGS ARE GOING AT THAT POINT WITH THE SUCCESS OF MUSK VARIO SOUTHER ENDEAVORS LIKE SPASECTS WHOS ONLY NATURAL THAT INVESTORS WOULD EXPECT AT THE MODEL FOR ROBER DOWN ANJUNIOR'S TONY STOCK MIGHT MOVE ON TO A DIFFERENT ROLE A TESSELA FOUR YEARS LATER AND MUSK HAS NOW DECIDED TO STAY SO FRIEND FOR A DECKATE BY THE WAY WAS A DECAED LONG CONTRACT THIS IS TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO WHAT EXACTLY WAS THE COMPENSATION PLAN AGAIN THE ZANDROSORKAN QUOTE MISTER MUSK WILL BE PAID ONLY IF HE REACHES A SERIES OF DRAW DROPPING MILESTONES BASED ON THE COMPANY'S MARKET VALUE AND OPERATIONS OTHERWISE HE WILL BE PAID NOTHING SO IN OTHER WORDS THE COMPENSATION PACKAGE O THA MUSK IS RECEIVING WAS SOLELY INFENTIVE BASE IT'S NOT AS THOUGH HE SIND A CONTRACT WITH TESSL WITH ALL HIS FRIENDS WETH HE JUST GAVE HIM FIFTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS AT THE TIME THAT ALL THIS HAPPENED THE VALUATION OF TESSLA TOTAL WAS SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS TWENTY BUXE SHARE THARE'S THE VALUTION OF TESTL WHEN THE SIME THE STEAL IR'S A PROVE BY EIGHTY PER CENT OF TESTL SHAREHOLDERS THE PLAN REQUIRED HIM TO GROW MARKET CAP BY FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR INCREMENTS WITH THE FIRST MILESTONE STARTING AT A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR VALLUATION THE FINAL MILESTONE WATH SIX HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS SO ELON MUSK AT A TIME WHEN THE COMPANY WAS VALUATED IN PUBLIC MARKETS AT SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS SIGNED A CONTRACT SAYING I ONLY GET MY PAY PACKAGE IF I HIT TEN IF I IF I HAT ELEVEN ACS BASICALLY IF I TAKE THE CURRENT VALUE OF TESTLA AND MULTIPLY BY ELEVEN THEN I GET THIS PAY PACKAGE NOW IF YOU'RE A SHAREHOLDER LIKE THAT'S A GREAT DEAL BECAUSE IF WE HIT THAT I'M HAPIT PAY HIM ANDIF WE DON'T HIT THAT THEN WE DON'T PAY HIM GREAT DEAL RIGHT WOULD YOU MAKE THAT DEAL WITH YOUR BLOSS TO DAY OR WOITH YOUR COMPANY WOULD YOU MAKE THET YEALL YOU'L TAKE ANY PAY TIT AT YU YOUD DEFER ALL YOUR WAGES NO NO PAYMENT OF ANYTHING BUT IF YOUR COMPANY INCREASES BY ELEVEN TIMES IN DOLLU THEN YOU GET A BIG BONAS ELEVEN NOTUITE NOT THREE TIMES ELEVEN TIMES IN DOLLY WOULD YOU TAKE THAT YOUL VERY FEW PEOPLE WOULD MUSK IS A RERISK SEEKIN DOLLY AND TESSLA  SHEREHOLDERS THE LIKE AGAIN WHAT IS THE PROBLEM HERE THIS IS A GREAT DEAL  TESTLAS SAIT A DOEZEN TARGETS EACH FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN NEXT STARTING AT A HUNDRED BILLION THAN A HUDRED FIFTY THAN TWO HUNDRED ALL THE WAY ON TO SIX HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS ALSO THE COMPANY THAI HE DOZN REVENUE AND ADJUSTED PROFITGOLES MUSKLEL RECEIVE ONE POINT SECATE MILLION SHARES OR ABOUT ONE PER CENT OF THE COMPANY ONLY AFTER HE REACHES MILESTONES FOR BOTH BUT AS ANVEROSTORE CAN WROTE OF THE TIME THIS IS TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO PUT THESE NUMBERS IN PERSPECTIVE TESTLA IS ONLY WORTH ABOUT FIFTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS TO DAY IF MUSTLER SOMEHOW ABLE TO INCREASE THE VALUE OF TESTLET A SIX HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS A FIGURE MANY EXPERTS WOULD CONTENT IS LAUGHABLY IMPOSSIBLE AND WOULD MAKE TESTAL ONEOF THE FIVE LARGEST COMPANIES IN THE U S BASED ON CURN VALUATIONS HISTOCKA WORD COULD BE WORTH AS MUCH AS FIFTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS MUSK'S CRITICS ACTUALLY AT THE TIME COMPLAINED THAT IT WAS A PUBLICITY STUNS THAT THERE IS NO WAY HE'D REACH ANY OF THESE NUMBERS UNTI THE WHOLE POINT OF THE EXERCISE WAS TO SUGGEST THE TESTL IS BIGGER THEN IT WAS IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM  TO MANIPULATE THE SYSTEMS SAIT ANDE ROSS ORKAN BY TRYING TO PROP UP THE STOCK PRICE FOR ITS TEMPORARY PERIOD BECAUSE EVEN ONCE HIS SHARES VEST  YEST A HOLD THEM FOR FIVE YEARS BEFORE HE CAN SELL THEM SWE CAN'T ACTUALLY LIKE GAT THE SHARES THAT WERE FIFTY SIX BILLION AND THEN IMMEDIATELY TURN ROUND AND SELL THEM AND UNDER CUT THE VALUE OFTE COMPANY CAN'T DO THAT SO THE JUDGE STRUCK DOWN WHAT IS AGAIN ONE OF THE MOST RISK LADEN PAY PACKAGES IN AMERICAN HISTORY BECAUS MUSK ET HIS MARKS THAT'S INSANE ITS ATUALLY QUITE EVIL IF YOU TAKE A RISK A NEW BENEFIT FROM THAT RIST BY BENEFITING ALL THE SHAREHOLDERS TO THE EXTENT THAT EVERYBODYWHO BOUGHT IN IT TWENTY THIS A PERSON WHO ON NOT THE PERSON WO START F THIS OWNED NINE SHARES OF TESSLA NINE THOSE SHARES OF TESSLA AT THE TIME THA MUSK SIGNE THIS PAY PACKAGE THOSE SHARES OF TESSLA WERE THE PRICE AT TWENTY DOLLARS  TESTLA SHARES TO DAY OURE TRADETONGAT ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT  DOLLARS YOURON'T GET TO WINE ABOUT THAT I'M SORRY YOU DO NOTS THAT'S AN ABSURD CONTENTION AND JUST DEMONSTRATES ONCE AGAIN THERE ARE MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIARY WHO DO NOT GIVE ANY RAPS ABOUT PROPERTY RIGHTS OR THE RULE OF LAW OK KATN JUST ONE SECOND WE'LL GET TO SOCIAL MEDIA HEARINGS ON THE HILL WHICH AGAIN IT'S FASCINATING TO SEE

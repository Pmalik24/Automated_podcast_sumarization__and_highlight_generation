I EVERYBODY IRE GLAS HERE SO OUR STAFF IS BUSY REPORTING OUT STORIES FOR NEXT WEEK SHOW AND FOR OTHER UPCOMING SHOWS AND WE HAD REREN SCEGEL FOR THIS WEEK AND WE DECIDED IN THIS STRESSFUL TIME IT MIGHT BE NICE TO KEEP THINGS LIGHT AND FUNNY AND SO A THAT'S WHAT THIS EPISODE IS AND IT HAS NOT ONE BUT TWO OF THE MOST POPULAR STORIES WE HAVE EVER PUT ON THE AIR THE FIRST A VERSION OF THIS EPISODE WAS BROADCASK OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO BACK WHEN WE REISTRIBUTED BY PUBLIC REATING INTERNATIONAL AND OUR PISODES BEGAN WITH THE LITTLE PIRI AUDIOGOGO WHICH I DON'T KNOW ACANAMAS FROM PIAI PUBLIC RADIO INS AN ATON FROM PIAI PUBLIC PI OI GRAIO PUBLI GRATIA PUBLIC READY READIOL INCONATIONAL O N WHAT COULD BE MORE AMERICAN THEN THE PERSON WHO SEES SOMETHING THEYV NEVER DONE BEFORE DREAMS THEY COULD DO IT ITGOES AFTER THAT DREAM WHELL LIT'S BEGIN TO DAY WITH T A WOMAN WHO DREAMS OF DIRECTING A PLAY IN THE SMALL TOWN WHERE SHE LIVES A COLLEGE TOWN SOMEWHERE BELOW THE MASON DIXON LINE IN THE HILLS OF APALAZCHA A TOWN WHICH WILL REMAIN FOR OUR PURPOSES TO DAY UNNAMED I DON'T LHINK SHEAD EVER DIRECTED IN AND SHE CLAIM TO HAVE ACTED AND IT WAS NEVER REALLY QUITE CLEAR JUST WHAT HER CREDENTIALS WERE BUT SHE SHE AM HA MANAGE TO CONVINCE THE THE LOCAL THEADREPARTMENT OF THIS COLLEGE THAT SHE SHOULD DIRECT A PRODUCTION OF PETER PAN WHEN HE WAS IN THE TENTH GRADE AND NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE JACKATE SAW HER PRODUCTION AND LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE IN TOWN HE HEARD ABOUT FOR WEEKS BEFOREHAND SLOWLY BUT SURELY ANOW YOU BEGAN TO HEAR YOU KNOW SRT OF RUMORS ABOUT THIS PRODUCTION FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW THAT THEY HAD SPENT A LOT OF MONEY RENTING THESE FLYING APPARATUSES OUT OF NEW YORK AND APPARENTLY THEIR ONLY A ITIS LIKE ONE COMPANY IN A HANDFUL OF THESE APPARATUSES IS HAT A GIT THEM WAS MAJURE COO THIS IS THE STORY NOT JUST AF A MEDIOCRA PLAY OR A TERRIBLE PLAY WHEN COM TO DATO IS NOT EVEN A STORY ABOUT A PLAY THIS THE STORY ABOUT A FIASCO AND ABOUT WHAT MAKES A FIASCO AND ONE INGREDIENT OF MANY FIASCOS IS THAT GREAT MASSIVE PART RENCHING CHAOS AND FAILURE ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR WHEN GREAT AMBITION IS COME NG TO PLAY WHEN PLANS ARE BIG EXPECTATIONS GREAT HOPES AT THEIR HIGHEST AND WHAT SHEF T UNDERSTAND IS THAT EVERYBODY IN THI SORT OF COMMUNITY UNDERSTOOD THAT THER WERE THE THERE WAS CERTAINLY A SORT OF AIR AF EVERY ONE SORT OF REACHING BEYOND THEIR OWN GRASP EVERY ACTOR WAS A SORT OF IN A ROLL THAT WAS JUST A LITTLE TOO BIG FOR THEM A EV EVERY ASCPECT OF THE THE SAT IN THE CREW AM AND IN A RUMOR SIN SORT OF COOKED AROUND AND THERE WAS AS HUGE CREW THAT A LOTS OF THINGS BEING PAINTIS  THIS INFACT IS ONE OF THE CRITERIA FOR GREATNESS IS THAT EVERYONE IS JUST ABOUT TO REACH JUST BEYOND THEIR GRASS BECAUSE THAT THAT IS WHEN GREATNESS CAN OCCUR THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT AND MAY BE GREATNESS COULT HAVE OCCURRED WHAT TO DAY IN OUR PROGRAM WHAT HAPPENS WHEN GREATNESS DOES NOT OCCUR WHAT HAPPENS IN FACT WHEN FUMBLE LEADS TO ERROR LEADS TO MISHAP AND BEFORE YOU KNOW T YOU HAVE LEFT THE REALM OF ORDINARY MISTAKE AND CHAOS AND YOU HAVE ENTERED INTO THE MORE ETHEREAL SPECIALIZED REALM OF FIASCO TO DAY SHOW FIASCOS A PHILOSOPHICAL INQUIRY PERHAPS THE FIRST EVER STRARNG AS WE KNOW INTO WHAT MAKES A FIASCA WHAT TAKES OUR ORDINARY LIVES THAT EXTRA DISTANCE INTO FIASO WUT B B BE EASY CHICAGO IT'S THIS AMERICAN LIFE OR MOUR GLASS THERE IS MUCH MUCH MORE TO LEARN ABOUT FIASCOS IN THIS HOUR STAY WITH US WE BEGIN OUR SHO WITH THIS TRUTHPABLE PETER PAN HE NACT ONE OPENING NIGHT OPENING NIGHT COMES AND YOU KNOW WILL ALMOST EVERYBODY IN THE AREA IN THE  TEN MILE RADIUNS OF THIS THEATR KNOWS SOMEBODY IN THIS PRODUCTION SO THE PLACE IS PRETTY MUCH PACKED UM AND I DON'T KNO IF REMEMBER THE OPENING MOMENT OF PETER PAN BUT IT'S THE THREE LITTLE KIDS SLEEPING IN THEIR BED AND A PETER PAN COMES FLYING IN THE WINDOW AND IN THIS IN THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCTION THE AM THERE'S A BIG A BED WITH ALL THE THREE KIDS IN IT AND OFF TO THE LEFT I REMEMBER A IS A BIG HUGE WARDROBE IN THIS A LARGE WINDOW THERE AND A LITTLE BUREAU AND PETER PAN COMES IN AND A YOU DON'T HAS THE LITTLE SPEECH WHERE HE SAYS YOU KNOW ANYBODY CAN FLY WHY WITH JUST TOTLE MAGIC DUST ONE CAN FLY AND AM AND PETER PAN SORT OF SPRINKLES THIS MAGIC DUST IN THE AIR AND SURE ENOUGH IM THE KIDS SORT OF SUDDENLY JUST LURCH INTO THE AIR OM AND IT BECOMES CLEAR RIGHT AWAY THAT THE PEOPLE THAT THEY'VE HIRED TO RUN THESE FLYING APPARATUS IS REALLY AREN'T QUITE CLEAR ON HOW THEY ACTUALLY WORK SO INSTEAD OF THE THE KIDS AM SORT O SAILING YOU KNOW GRACEFULLY TO AND FRO THEY SOR TO HANG IN THE AIR LIKE POPET'S JUST SORT OF DANGIN THEIRS N GETTING JERKED UP AND NCH OR TO OR BACK AND FORTH AND THEY AN THEY ES TENT TIMES IT JUST STATIONARY JUST JUST JUST JUST HANGING THEIR LEK AT LIKE A LIKE A SPIED AND THEN  SEVERAL OF THEM START TO TO SORT OF A CIRCUMSCRIBE THESE CIRCLES IN THE AIR A WHERE IT'S CLEAR THAT THE THE THE PEOPLE RUNNING THE THE MACHINES HAVE JUST SORT OF SET THEM OFF ON THESE KIND OF OVAL COURSES THAT SPIRAL FARTHER AND FARTHER UT AND IF YOU'RE SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE THETE WAS CLEARLY A SENSE OF FEAR A THE FACE SIS OF THESE PEOPLE AM  OF THE ACT THE ACTORS THE ACTORS ACTUALLY YOU COULD SENSE THEIR LACK OF CONFIDENCE E TIS IN THE THE THE PEOPLE RUNNING THE MACHINES IN THE BACK SO THEY LAY LAT AND IN THE AUDIENCE YOU ACTION TO THIS PLAIN IS JUST ARE THEY LAUGHING NO ONE IS LAUGHING EVERY ONE T THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT AUDIENCES ESPECIALLY IN THE LIVE THEPRODUCTION IS THAT THEY'RE VERY FORGIVING THEY WANT THE SHOW TO WORK AND SO EVERYONE HAS SORT OF GRIPPING THEIR CHAIR A LITTLE TIGHTLY RIGHT YOU KNOW WE WE FEEL FOR THET YOU ORE THEY'RE UP THERE THEY'RE EMBARRASSING THEMSELVES FOR US YOU KNOW ALL DENTIFIED WITH THAT WE ARE BECOME THEM AND SO THE AUDIENCE I THINK WAS VERY FORGIVING AND VERY UNDERSTANDING OF THIS THIS MOMENT BUT THERE WAS ONE ONE MOMENT THAT IN THIS FIRST OPENING SCENE THAT KIND OF PUT THE AUDIENCE ON NOTICE AND THAT'S WHEN AS THE KIDS A SRT OF JERKING UP AND DOWN SRING IT BACK AND FORTH AND CERTAIND INSTEAD OF GOING AROUND TESE OVALS AT ONE POINT THE LITTLE THE LITTLEST ONE THE LITTLE BOY IS IS SORT OF BEING FLUNG AROUND A LITTL THO A LITTLE TOO HARD OH YES THE LEAST MASS TO RESIST WHATEVER THE MACHINERY IS DOING TO HIM RIGHT OR GAS SA ANT AND SO HE'S FLYING AROUND THE CIRCLE AND AND AN THE AUDIENC SORT OF SEEZS THIS COMING AND IS A REAL SENSE OF PAIN AND AND GRIPPING OF THE CHAIR IN WHITE KNUCKLENESS AS THE KID SUDDENLY DOES A JUST A AN ENORMOUS SPLAT INTO THE WARDROBE I MEAN IT IT'S CLEARLYS HART YOU KNOW AND HE COMES OFF OF IT SORT OF YOU KNOW A LITTLE DAZED ENCOUSE HE'S JERKED UP IN THE AIR LITTLE BIT AND OFTEN A LITTLE TWO HIGH SO HE SUDDENLY SET OF IN THE WORKING HE'S OT T  LAUGH OF THE STAY JUST SELF IS NOW UP THERE WITH THE LIGHTS IN ON ANNO ONHY JUST OUT OF ONLIN HOU IS BLOMIT BACK DOWN TO THE STAGE AND AND BE CAUGHT UP JUST BEFORE HE HIT THE FLOOR AND AND IT WAS IT WAS HAR TO WATCH YE CAN TELL IT'S IT'S AN INAN INCREDIBLY FUNNY MOMENT HEOPL LIKE US SAY THE AUDIENCE WAS STILL IN THIS VERY FORGIVING MODE AND NO ONE SAID A WORD WE JUST ALL SIT THERE'S SOT HOLDING OUR BREATH AND THIS THAT WE AR TENSION OF BEING IN THE AUDIENCE THINKING OH OH MY GOODNESS THEY HAVE GOTTEN OFF TO A VERY BAD START OH THIS THIS IS NOT GOOD RIGHT AND WE FEEL FOR THEM M MAY I JUST INTERRUPT FOR JUST A MOMENT JUST JUST JUST SAY NOW NOW AT THIS POINT BECAUSE AFTER AU WE ARE NOT JUST JOINED HERE TOGETHER IN THE RADIO YOU AND I TO DAY TO LAUGH AT THE FOYBLES OF THE UNFORTUNEATE NO NOW WERE HERE TO ENUMERATE THE QUALITIES OF A FISCO AT THIS POINT WE ARE NOT YET IN THE TERRI TORY OF FIASE NOW NOW BECAUSE YOU KNOW LIKE US SAY AUDIENCES ARE FORGIVING AND THEY YOU KNOW ONE OR ONE OR TWO MISTAKES EVEN BIG ONES LIKE THIS THEGON NOL LET THAT ROD DI SAY ARE WE DID WE DID WE WERE VERY GOOD AND A SO WE ARE NOT YET AT FIASCA WE ARE AT I SOT OF NORMAL LEVEL OF MISHAP RIGHT WHAT HAPPENS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THIS THEY DISAPPEAR TO NEVER NEVERLAND AND IF YOU REMEMBER THE THE STAGE GOES DARK AND THEN WHEN THE LIGHTS COME UP THERE'S CAPTAIN HOOK AND HE'S GIVING IT'S THE FIRST OPENING SOLILOQUY ABOUT HOW EVIL HE IS AND WHAT A MENACE HE IS AND HOW HE YOU KNOW HARMSPEOPLE AND HATES CHILDREN AND IT'S ALL THAT GOOD STUFF IT'S THE CAPTAIN TOOK IS OUT THERE AND HE LOOKS GREAT COME ON IS BIG OLD FAT HATS IN A AND AM THIS GREAT HOOK AN THESE WILD LOOKIN BOOTS IN EVERYTHING AND PEOPLE OF THING WERE CONFIDENT SOMETHING'S HAPPENING IT'S A GOOD SIGN IT'S A GOD TIME AND HE'S IN CHARGE DISGUISE HE'S GOT A BAD MUSTACHE AND HE IS CERTAINLY EVIL YES AND I'M THE AUDIENCE IS TOTALLY IN HIS POCKET HE'S HE'S PEAKING AWAY AND GESTURING WILDLY AND AND GOING ON AND ON ABOUT HOW BAD HE IS AND THEN IT A CERTAIN POINT AS HE GESTURES HIS HOOK AND THE ENTIRE BLACK HASING UP TO HIS ELBOW FLINGS OFF OF HIS HAND AND FLIES INTO THE AUDIENCE AND CUNCHIS AN OLD LADY IN THE GOT AND NOW HE IS BAD VERY BAHE HAD LIKE THE WORST THAD LIVE I'VE EVER HEARD AN ME WHAT DO YOU SAY HAT AS AHORSE HIS HAND IT IS NOW MAKE IT THAT  OS TO THE AUDIENCE AN HE'S NOT MOMENT FOR ANY ACTORVERY VERY IF THE VERY I MUNS OF YOUR CHARACTER IS THAT YOU HAVE A LOOK YOUR NAME IS CAPTAIN LITERALLY ALL THAT'S CAN HAPPEN FOR THE REST OF THE JUST PEOPLE GOING TO REFER TO YOU BY THAT HOOK YOURE ENTIRE MOTIVATION AS A CHARACTER IS EFFECT THAT YOU IS THAT YOUR ARM IS EATEN OFF BY AN ALLIGATOR ANDTHAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE ENTIRE PLOT AND YOU HAVE A HOOS STEMS FROM THAT FAT RIGHT RIGHT AND NOW SUDDEINLY YOU HAVE NO O IN FACT YOU HAVE FIVE FINGERS ON A HAND AS IF A MIRACLE BY THE WORD DAPTAIN HOOKS THA YOU KNOW THEY JUST DON'T MAKE THOSE HOOKS LIKE THEY USED TO THAT WAS ACTUAY THE OUTLEVE I WIL THEN THE LIGHTS COME UP AND WE ARE INEVER NEVERLAND AND HE NECTI YET THIS IS LIKE HAT TO AND AND AND  CAPTAIN HOK MIGHT HAVE STOOD IN FRONT OF THE SEP HE DIDN'T REALLY SEE ITCAUSE HE WAS US HE SPOKE FROM SHADOW AM NOW THE LIGHTS COME UP IN THIS SUSPOSED TO BE A VERY DRAMATIC MOMENT THE THE RUMORS OF ALL THIS CREW AND THE PAINTING AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON AND ALL THIS CONSTRUCTION ALL WORK TOWARDS THIS ONE MOMENT CAUSE WHEN THE LIGHTS CAME UP HERE WAS NEVER NEVER LAND THIS SORT OF PSYCHADELIC SET THERE WERE PAPER MACHET MUSHROOMS EVERYWHERE OF DIFFERENT SIZEIS IT WAS IT WAS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL AND SEREAL FLEM AND AM AND THERE'S NOBODY THERE AND THEN FROM THE UPPER RAFTERS OF STAGE RIGHT SUDDENLY THE KIDS AND PETER PAN APPEAR LYING A FLYING THEY'RE FLYING AM AND THEIR LANDING THEIR LANDING OCCURS RATHER RAPIDLY AT AT AN ANGLE OF ABOUT FORTY FIVE DEGREES TO THE STAGE THEY COME DOWN BASICALLY LIKE I DON'T KNOW LED SINKERS ON A LINE AND CRASH TO THE FLOOR AM AND THEN OR SORT OF JUST DRAGGED ACROSS THE FLOOR LIKE LIKE MOPS AND WIPE OUT ALL OF THE MESHROOMS  AND SO NOW HAVE WE ARRIVED AT A TURNING POINT IN OUR FIASCO YE YE IT'S CLEAR NOW THAT THE AUDIENCE IS GIVING WAY SOMETHING HAS BEEN LOST SOME SENSE OF DECLORUM THAT THAT THAT LITTLE BIT OF FORGIVENESS AT THE AUDIENCE HAS FOR THE ACTORS AND EMPATHY AN EMPATHY IT'S BEGINNING TO DISSIPATE WELL THERE WAS A SPLIT IN THE AUDIENCE THERE WERE THE SORT OF THE YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO WERE THE LEAST FORGIVEN THEY STARTED TO GO FIRST OKI SO THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS YOU KNOW COUPLE OF COLLEGE STUDENTS MAY BE THEY STARTED TO LAUGH OUT LAUGH OLL BE HONEST IRE I MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONE OF THOSE FIRST PEOPLE TO LAUGH I WAS IN THE TENTH GRATE  IT WAS HARD TO NOT LAUGH AT THIS YOU KNOW AM BUT THEN WHATEVER RESTRAINT THAT YOU KNOW THE AUDIENCE HAD IT JUST EVAPORATED AT THIS POINT BECAUSE THERE WERE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN QRICK SECESSION THAT DIST MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO HOLD ANY SENSE OF DECORUM AM WHICH ARE FOR EXAMPLE TINKER BELL APPEARS FOR THE FIRST TIME IROUND THIS MOMENT AND AM TINKER BELL IS ESSENTIALLY A LIGHT BULB ON AN EXTENSION CORD AND A WHAT YET AND THIS WAS YOU KNOW THIS WUST THE DIRECTOR'S IDEA OF LIKE YOU KNOW YOU KNW BEING RALL BEING VERY MODERN YOU KNOW TINKER BELL WAS JUST GOIN TO BE YOU KNOW THIS LITERAL LIGHT BULL DANGLING FROM AN EXTENSION COR ISN'T IN INOTHER PRODUCTIONS WETE THE DOIS THAT SOME ONE WILL SHINE ALIGHT SHING A LIGHT OR THEY'LL JUST A BEAM OF FOCUS LIGHT AND THE THAT PINPRICK OF LIGHT IS AS TO BE TINKER B THAT'S RIGHT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR NOTHING AT ALL AND P JUST ADDRESSED THE INVISIBLE YOU KNOW SPRITE RAND  WELL THAT DID NOT HAPPEN IN THIS CASE THIS BULB COMES JUST DANGLING DOWN THI SORT OF HANGS AROUND TTHIS MAKE TAIR LIO BULB JUST HANGS AROUND AND PEOPLE ARE TALKING TO IT AND I THINK TINKER BELL TINKERBELL MUST HAVE HAD AN APPEARANCE IN THE FIRST ACT BUT BUT IT WAS SOMEWHERE AND HERE THAT PEOPLE JUSTARTED LAUGH AM THEN  ANOTHER THING THAT HAPPENED WAS A LATER ON IN THE SCENE IF YOU MEMBER WINDY GETS A TRAPPED ON AN ISLAND AND A AND SHE SHE SPOTS A KITE THAT'S FLOATING BY AN FLYING BY AND SHE SUPPOSE TO GRAB IT AND ATTACH IT TO HER BACK AND FLY OFF RAG RAN WELE OF COURSE THE KITE HAS ATTACHED TO THE FLYING APPARATUS LINE AND IT IT GETS CLOSER AND CLOSE TO HER SHE STANDING ON THIS LITTLE PAPER MACHET HILL AND A BUT THE FLYING APPARATUS PEOPLE CAN'T QUITE GET IT CLOSE ENOUGH TO HER AT E REACH SO SHE HAS TO STEP OUT INTO THE WATERS THAT SHE'S JUST TOLD US IS FILLED WITH CROCODILES TO TO GRABIT SHE FINALLY GETS THE KITE AND WHEN SHE YANKS ON IT IT POPS OFF THE FLYIN ATES AND THE HOOK GOES ZINGING UP INTO THE LIGHTS AND CATCHES SO NOW THERE IS THIS BIG LOOP OF WIRE HANGI IN FRONT OF THE STAGE AND THERE'S WHEN BEHOLDING THE KITE AND A SHE ADD LEVD HIS BEST SHE COULD AS I REMEMRBER SHE SHE SO TO THAT ON SECOND THOUGHT MAY BE I CAN SWIM AND WITH THAT SHE WALKED OFF THE STAGE SOT OF MOTIONING HER ARMS LIKE YOU WOULD DO THE SWIM THE DANCE AN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE SAY SHE DOES THAT AT THIS POINT I MEAN THE AUDIENCE THEN ACTORS ARE JUST FALLING APART THEY ARE SO FRIGHTENED OF THE AUDIENCE THERE ARE JUST BELLY LAUGHS ROLLING UP TO THE STAGE FROM THE AUDINCE PEOPLE ARE HOWLING WITH LAUGHTER AT EVERY MISTAKE AND NOW ANY SMALL MISTAKE JUST TAKES ON THESE THESE DESE GES YOU KNOW IT'S JUST A ANY INSTIGATION FOR LAUGHT ER IS JUST ENOUGH FOR THIS AND NOW THE OLD PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN IT UP EVERY ONE HAS QUIT BEING NICE NOW THERE IS JUST THIS KIND OF FRIGHTENING ROAR THAT COMES FROM THE AUDIENCE EVERY TIME THIS A MISTAKE WHAT HAPPENED AT SOME POINT THE AUDIENCE TURNED AND REALIZED AWAIT I BREALIS WITS GOING ONE HERE THIS IS A FIASKA  THIS IS A FIASKO AND WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT A FE ASK GOW IS THAT ONCE IT STARTS TO TUMBLE DOWN REGT AUDIENCE WANTS TO PUSH IT FARTHER ALAN OH THEY GET HUNGRY FOR MORE FIASKA OF YE IF IF THE PLAY PROCEEDED PERFECTLY THEY WOULD BE DISAPPOINT AL HIT WOULD HAVE BEN A GRAVE DISAPPOINTMENT HAD THERE NOT BEEN JUST ONE MORE MISTAKE AFTER ANOTHER ONE MORE EMBARRASSMENT AFTER ANOTHER NOW THE REASON THERE THERE IS THE CHRONICLE THESE EMBARRASSMENTTHIS IS WHY I HAVE REMEMBERED THIS DISPLAY FOR TWENTY FIVE TOWARDS ACTTHREE A A THE DIRECTOR HAD DECIDED THAT SHE WANTED TO BREAK DOWN THE FOURTH WALL YOU KNOW THIS WAS THIS WAS CUTTING EDGETEATERS FAR SHE WAS CONCERNED OFEGES AT SWEN T EXPLAINED WHEN WE SAY BREAKING DOWN THE FOURTH WALL WHAT WILLBY MEAN IS THE WALL BETWEEN THE THE THE ACTORS AND THE AUDIENCE WHIT YOU KNOW USUALLY IT'S I PERMEABLE BET THEN TO CAME APPOINT IN THE LATE SIXTY SOR WY SEVENTY WERLOTTHEATERS TISLY THAT THE ACTORS WOULD COME OUT INTO THE AUDIENT THAT'S RIGHT AND AND INTERACT WITH THE AUDIENCE AND AND AND BREAK DOWN THAT WALLSO HE THE IDEA BEING THAT YOU WOULD GET MORE IN TOUCH WITH THE DRAMATIC SENSE AND THE REALITY OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING RIGHT ANYWAY SO IN THIS PARTICULAR SCENE WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WAS HIT THE INDIANS WE'RE GOING TO THROW ROPE LADDERS DOWN FROM THE BALCONY AND CLIMB DOWN THESE ROPE LADDERS INTO THE AUDIENCE AND AND YOU KNOW MOVE AMONG THE AUDIENCE AND FRIGHTNESS WIG ANYWAY I KNEW ABOUT THE SEEINK IS MY FRIEND DAVID WHO I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH WAS IN IT AND A SO WHEN DAVID WAS CLIMBING OVER THE TOP OF THIS BALCONY TO A CLIMBE DOWN THE ROPE HE LOST HIS FOOTING AND FELL TO THE FLOOR FROM THE BALCONY A DISTANCE OF ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FEET A GGOOD ID A GOOD FALL THAT'S HORRIBLE YET AND HE LANDED ON BOTH OF THE FEET AND SPRAING BOTH OF HIS ANKLES AND OF COURSE CURLED INTO A FEEDAL POSITION AND BEGAN TO CRY RIGHT HE WAS REALLY REALLY HURT NOW TO DE RICIAT THE HORRIBLE MOMEN I'M ON DESCRIBING ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S A FRIDAY NIGHT WE ARE IN A COLLEGE TOWN AND THERE IS A VOLUNTEER FIRE AND AMBULANCE DEPARTMENT AND IN ORDER TO SUMMON THE RESCUERS FROM WHEREVER THEY ARE AN ALARM IS SOUNDED THAT CAN BE HEARD FOR FIVE MILES THAT ALARM IS LOCATE AT RIGHT OVER THIS THEATERE SO THE ALARM GOES OFF HOK GI THIS IS AN ARRAD SIREN IT IS SO LOUD YOU CAN PIT YOUR FINGERS IN YOUR EAR IN ITS STILL HEARDING YOUR EARS WE'RE RIGHT UNDER IT IT CAN BE HEARD FOR FIVE IN A MENUTE AND THEN OF COURSE THREE MINUTES LATER BOSTING THROUGH THE DOOR OF THE THEATRE ARE THESE YOU KNOW FIFTEEN FIREMENTWHO WARE IN BOOTS HATS THEY GOT HOSES THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ALL THEY KNOW IS THAT THEY'VE BEEN TEN I AND DIS THAT A AD TO THE CHAOS THE THE DIRECTOR OF COURSE HAS INSOT OF FLOG THE ACTORS THAT THE SHOW MUST GO ON NO MATTER WHALL NO MATTER WHOT SO WHILE ALL OF THIS IS HAPPENING AND PEOPLE ORE SO SEVERAL PEOPLE ARE ATTENDING TO DAY TID AND OTHER PEOPLE ARE HAVE JUST NOW LIKE THESIDEED THAT SENSE THE FIREMEN HERE HE'S GOING TO BE FINE THEY CAN START LAUGHING AND NOW THE AUDIENCE HAS HAS JUST COMPLETELY LOST THE SHOW IF PEOPLE WAS STANDING UP IN THEIR SEATS AN SHOUTING FOR MORE EY WHAT BLOT MA I THIS POINT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY IN ERD AND THEY WR SOMEHOW THAT'S HOW THIS ENTIRE PLAY ENDED WHAT'S IN YOUSTING ABOUT ABOUT THIS AS A FIASCO IF F I FIKE THE THING IT MAKES ME UNDERSTAND ABOUT FIASCOS IS THAT IS THAT THE FIASCO ITSELF IS AN ALTERED STATE THAT IS ALL THE NOMAL RULES ARE OFF YOU HAVE LEFT OF THE NOMAL RULES OF HOW THE AUDIENCE CAN INTERACT WITH THE ACTOR RIGHT I'VE NEVER SEEN A PRODUCTION LIKE THIS AND I'VE NEVER SEEN AN AUDIENCE COLLAPSE LIKE THIS SEE WHAT I WONE DO LOIK WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE GO FOR THEATR TO THEATREFOR LIC WHAT KIND OF RELEASE PEOPLE WANT MEEN PEOPLE WANT AN EXPERIENCE THAT WOULD TAKE THEM OUT OF ARE THEMSELVES WE ALL WANT AN EXPERIENCETHAT WOULD TAKE US OUT OF OURSELVES AND INTO ANOTHER PLACE AND ANOTHER REALITY RIGHT AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS PRODUCTION EVEN THOUGH IT WAS TIF FIASKO IN FACT BECAUSE IT WAS A FIASCO WAS MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN THAT THAN ANY CONVENTIONAL PLAY COULD BE WELL SEE OVEN DISAGREE WITH THIS AN I THINK YOU KNOW THE OLD THEATRE CRITICS YOU KNOW THE THE ANCIENTS WOULD SAY THAT THE REASON YOU GO TO THE THEATR IN TO SEE A GREAT PRODUCTION IS TO BE THINK THE WORD THEY USE TO USE IS TRANSPORTED THE IDEA THING THAT YOU WOULD BE LIFTED AWAY FROM YOUR ANIMAL NATURE AND INTO THESE HIERE MORE SPIRITUAL REALMS ARE BEING GETTING TOUCH WITH THESE THESE GREATER THE TRAGIC EMOTIONS RIGHT  WHAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE WAS EXACT OPPOSITE WE GOT TRANSPORTED DIRECTLY IN TOTCH WITH OUR ANIMAL BEING I IR SELL  BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S ALMOST IS RARE IF NOT MORE SO THAN A GREAT PRODUCTION JACK HEAD I'S THE COHOST OF A GREAT PEE BY THE AWORD WAITING PODCAST ABOUT RACE IN HISTORY CALLED UN CIVIL WHICH IF YOU WARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO LISTENG TO DURING THIS NATIONAL HOME LOCK DOWN OR ORN YOUR COMMUTE TO YOUR ESSENTIAL JOB I REALLY AT THAT JACK SAYS BY THE WAY THAT PEOPLE ASK HIM ABOUT THIS PETER PAN STORY STILL ALL THESE YEARS LATER AND THE YEAR SINCE WE FIRST RAN THIS WE GOT A LETTER FROM WHN OF

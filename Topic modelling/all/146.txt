ABOUT JOBIDONS LEADERSHIP STYLE SIXTY THREE PER CENT SAY THAT HE IS CALM BUT ONLY FIFTY PERCENT SAY THAT HE IS CURING AND ONLY THIRTY FIVE PER CENT SAY THAT HE IS NO NONSENTS MEANWHILE DONALD TRUMPS LEADERSHIP STYLE IS SEEN AS PROVOCATIVE BY SEVENTY ONE PER CENT BY TOUGH IT WOULD SEEM AS TOUGH BY SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT ENERGETIC BY SIXTY FIVE PER CENT NO NONSENSE BY FIFTY FIVE PER CENT AND ENTERTAINING BY FIFTY FIVE PER CENT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY DESPITE THE FACT THAT AMERICANS ARE REALLY DISSATISFIED WITH THIS MATCH UP THE STRUMPERS'S BIDON PERSPECTIVE MATCH UP WITH SIXTY FOUR PER CENT OF AMERICAN SAYING THAT THAT REMATCH WOULD MAKE THE THEM FEEL THAT THE POLITICAL SYSTEM IS TOTALLY BROKEN ON THE ECONOMY THE NUMBERS ARE AWFUL FOUR JOBIDON AS WELL THEY SHOULD BE ACCORDING TO THIS

THEY ARE T ABOUT THE SAME LEVEL WHICH JUS TO SAY ONLY TWENTY PER CENT ARE PLEASED AS PUNCH AS FAR AS THE CHOICE FOR PRESIDENT IF FINANCES ARE WORSE NOW THAN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC SEVENTY ONE PER CENT SAY THEY WOULD VOTE FOR TRUMP SO F YOU SAID THT YOUR FINANCES ARE WORSE THAN THEY WERE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WHICH IS LIKE FORTY FIVE PERCENT AMERICANS SEVEN AND TEN OF THOSE VOTERS SAY THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR PRESENT IN TRUMP ONEIN THE ADMINISTRATIONS EFFORTS ACCORDING TO C BS NEWS HAS BEEN DETEUT WHAT T SEASES BIDONS A COMPLISHMENT A LOT OF ODERS DO KNOW ABOUT SOME KEFFORTS AND AN APPARENTLY MATTERS FOR EXAMPLE INDEPENDENT WHOHAVE HEARD ABOUT THE BIDE ADMINISTRATION INVESTING AN INFOR STRUCTURE ARE BACKINGHIM BUT THOSE IN A PENANS RE PESENT A SMALL MINORITY OF PEOPLE AND HERE IS THE REALITY THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE FLAR THINKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY EITHER THINK THAT THEY ARE NO BETTER OFF OR SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE OFF THAN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH JOBIDONS POLICY THE FACTS AED MATTER IS THAT JO IDONS EASY MONEY POLICY WHICH HAS BEEN COMBINED WITH A EXTRAORDINARILY RESTRICTIVE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT MASSIVE SUBSIDIES TO HIS UNION BUDDIES GREEN BOONDOGALS AND ALL THE REST IT'S MAKING PEOPLE FEEL PRETTY INSECURE THEIR WAGES ARE NOT STACKING UP THE SAME WAY THEY WERE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC PRICES HAVE RISEN DRAMATICALLY AND IT DOESN'T LOOK AS THOUGH AN END IS IN SIGHT EVEN PEOPLE IN THE BUSINESS SECT OR HORE SUPPOSEDLY DOING AMAZING THANKS TO THE STOCK MARKET BOOM EVEN THOSE PEOPLE ARE HOLDING THEIR MONEY ON THE SIDELINES NOT SHURE EXACTLY WHERE TO PUT IT AND HE CAN HEAR THE INABILITY TWO HANDL THE ECONOMY IN THE VOICE OF TREASURY SECRETARY GANIC YELLIN WHO SUPPOSE TO BE HE BEG EXPERT ON THIS SORT OF STUFF SIR GJAN YELLINS AN INTERVIEW ON SN B S YESTERDAY IN WHICH SHE BASICALLY EXPLAIN THAT CHE HAS NO CLUE WHAT TO DO NEXT BECAUSE THEY DON'T THEY'VE NO CLITSU NEXT THE PROBAL OT KAINSY AN STIMULUS IS THAT WHEN THE STIMULUS DOESN'T WORK YOU HAVE NO MORE BULLETS TO FIRE SO THE THING ABOUT INNOVATION IS THAT INNOVATION IS DONE BY INDIVIDUAL ONTROPANORS WHO HAVE IDEAS AND THEN LOOK FOR THE FUNDING IN ORDER TO GO AND BUILD THOSE IDEAS BUT STIMULUS DOESN'T MAKE THE IDEAS MAGICALLY HAPPEN THI'S THE EQUIVLENT OF SUGGESTING THAT' SOME KID WHO GET STRAIGHT SEES IF YOU JUST GIVE HIM AN EXTRA JUCEBOX ANLHE'S GANG GET AIS THAT'S NOT THE WAY ANY OF THAT WORKS THE REALITY IS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO TRULY STIMULATE IN ECONOMY IS WITH INNOVATION AND GROWTH IT IS NOT SIMPLY BY HELLOCOPPERING MONEY EVERYWHERE BUT THAT IS THE ENTIRE PREMISE OF ALL LEFT WING ECONOMIC POLICIES THAT IF YOU SIMPLY HOVER UP MONEY FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THEN YOU BLOW IT OUT OR YOU'R NVE DO THAT YOU HOVER IT UP FROM THE FUTURE AND YOU BLOW IT OUT IN THE PRESENT SOMEHOW THAT'S GOING TO LEAD TO LONG TERM ECONOMIC GROWTH AND INNOVATION THE PROOF JUST AIN'T IN THE PUDDING SIR JANNE YELLIN WAS ASKED ON SAN B SES AT SQUACK BOX ABOUT THE GAS PRICE IS GAS PRICE IT CONTINUE TO BE EXTRORDINARILY HIGHT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN WHEN JOBIDON TOOK OFFICE AND JANNIELLIS HAS LIKE LOOK WE DON'T WE DON'T KNOW THERE'S NOTHNG WE CAN DO ABOUT IT THE TOUT IS TAR STANDING A PRODOCTION COTS THRO THE ANDO THE AR ARE YOU LOOKING AT TAKING ANY ACTION ON THAS FIR WELT THE PRICIDENT WANTS TO MAKE SURTS IT GAS PRICEIS RELN FORTABOL FORAMERICANS A AMERICANS CARE A GREATEAL ABOUT THE PRICE OF GAS A THERE'S STILL DOWN ADOLLAR TWEY OF THER HILES SUMMER ALTHOUGH THEY HAV GOIN A PRESIMPLY A WE'RE MYLINTERING THE SITUATION VERY CLOSELY THE PRICENT HAS TAKEN ACTIINO FOR THE LESTEER CERTAINLY THE RELEASE IS OF OIL FROM THE STRICTITIC PETROLAN RESER A PIV BEEN A IMPORTANT IN HOLDIN DON WELL PRICEISAN WILL CONTINUON AMONGER T THAT CLOSELY LASHIO WONTER HOWIT ACTUALLY NOW THE TWO THINGS THAT JOBIDAN IS DONE TAT OF TREMENDOUSLY EFFECTED GAS PRICES RELY THREE INFELLATION AFFECTS THE GAS PRICE TWO MASIVE REGULATIONS PLACED ON OIL AND GAS COMPANIES AND THE NOTION THAT JBIDON SPINS OUT AT EVERY TURN THAT HE IS GOING TO KILL OFF GAS HE'S GOING TO JUST DESTROY OIL PRODUCTION IN THIS COUNTRY AND THANY'S AT WHY DON'T YOU INVEST IN THE OIL RE FINERYES TO DAY WHELL BECAUSE YOU'VE SAID THATYOU'RE WANTO DESTROY THE INDUSTRY OVER THE COURSE OF NEXT FIVE OTE TEN YEARS THAS FACTOR NMBER TWO REGULATION AND INCENTIVIZATION AN FACTOR NMBER THREE JOBIN HAS DECIDED TO MAKE ENEMIES OF MANY OF THE BGEST OIL PRODUCERS ON PLANIN EARTH INCLUDING THE SALLY ROYAL GOVERNMENT AND BEFORE HE COME INT OFFICE YOU BASICALLY SAID THAT EW'S GIN TO CUT OFF THE SALTIES AT THE NEES AND THEY RETURN THE FAVOR BY SAYING WE'LL CUT YOU OFF AT THE NEES WHICH PRESUMABLY IS WHY THE GAS PRICES IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHEN THIS TOOL TOOK OVER WORK TWO DOLLARS AND FORTY TWO CENTS AND TO DAY THERRE THREE DOLLARS AN SEVENTY CENTS OR THEREABOUTS AND THE RALLY NEVER SUNK BELOW THAT IN ANY SERIOUS WAY MEANWHILE JANNE YELLIN IS CLAIMING THAT WE REALLY SHOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THIS U A BL U STRIKE SO WE COLNETLY HAVE A MASSIVE STRIKE THE BIGGEST STRIKE AGAINST THE T STRIKE  CARMAKERS IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY IT'S AGAINST ALL THREE TO STRIKE CARMAKERS AND SHE'S PRETENDING THAT THIS GON O HAVE NO ECONOMIC IMPACT THE SLOW DOWN AT THESE PLANTS BECAUSE THEY' HAVE TO BE WORRIED ABOUT AT LATAN IVE IT THAK JUST AS IT STARTIN TO CONNADAN T LI HANTO THROPTAN ARE REST CARA THAT WELL YO I I THINK IT'S PREMLYTURE TO BEENG MAKING FORECAST ABOUT WHAT IT LEANS FIFTY ECONOMY I IT WOULD TO AN VERY MUC CHON HOW LONG THE STRIKE LAESTS AND EXACTLY WHOS UFFECTED BY IT BUT IM IMPORTANT POINT TI THINK IS THIT THE TOSITS NEE TO NOWW THEY'R TISIGREEMENTS AND A TO WORK FOR WIN WIN S IT A CONTRACT THIT'S GOOD GOOD FOR THE WORK IS AND FIFTY INTISCRES WELL I'LL GEPE IT THE ENTIRE REASON THIS STRIKES HAPPENING LIKE ALL THE OTHER STRIKES THAT HAVE HAPPENED ON JOBIDON'S WATCH IS BECAUSE EVERY ONE IN UNION WORLD THINKS THAT JO BIDING IS ON THEIR SIDES THER ARE NOW ALL TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE EASY MONEY POLICIES AND THE INFLATION OF THE BIDE ADMINISTRATION IN ORDER TO STRIKE AGAINST THEI'RE EMPLOYERS HOPING THAT THE BY DIMINSTRATION IS GOING TO COME IN AND RAM DOWN SOME SORT OF BENEFICIAL DEALS THEM THAT WOOLL IN THE END BANKRUPT THESE CAR COMPANIES AGAIN REMEMBER  THE CAR COMPANIES WHEN BANKRUPT THE FIRST TIME BECAUES OF RICH UNION CONTRACTS INCLUDING TO FIND BENEFITS PENSION PLANS THAT'S

FACT ORY DOING THE RIVETING WOULD KILL FOR YOUR JOB RIGHT NOW PUT THAT ASIDE THE FACT IS THAT THE REAL REASON A MERICA BOOM DURING THE NINETEEN FIFTIES IS BECAUSE EVERY OTHER PLACE ON EARTH WAS ON

AUTHOR CONFRONTED HIM AND MINHASH ADMITTED THAT THE STORIES HAT HE TLLS ON STAGE AR OFFEN EXAGGERATED OR MADE UP WELL I MEAN SOME OF THESE STORIES ARE JUST PURELY INTENDED O PAINTAMERICA IN THE WORST POSSIBLE LIGHT AND THEYRE COMPLETELY MADE UP IS NOT RESULTING IN TREMENDOUS BLOWBACK FRORM INHAS ONE OF HIS ANECDOTES APPARENTLY CLAIMS A WHITE WOMAN FROM HIGH SCHOOL STOOD HIM UP FOR A PRAHM BECAUSE

THERE INHERENTLY TIED TO THE IDEA THAT AMERICA'S DEEPLY EVIL IN RACE'S PLACE MEN MAKE THOSE SORTS OF CLAIMS PRESUMABLY YOU SHOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF BACKING FOR THEM FROM THE FACT THAT THAT HE HAD TO MAKE UP THESTORIES IN THE FIRST PLACES PRETYGOODEVIDENCE THAT AMERICA IS NOT REMOTELY AS RACIS AND HORRIFYING AS MINHASH SUGGESTS FOR LAUGHS AND PROFIT AND LEFTISM IS A VERY VERY LUCRATIVE POINT OF

POINT TIME FOR SOME THINGS I LIKE AND SOME THINGS THAT I HATE SO THINGS THAT I LIKE TO DAY A LOT OF STATES URENOUCSTARN CUTTIZES WITH THE AMERICAN LIBRATY ASSOCIATIO WHICH IS UTTERLY APPROBRATE CONSIDERING THAT THE A LA IS NOW A LEFT TOING INTERESTSCROUP LIKE SO MANY OF OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS SENTR MICLE ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON POST HAS NOW TARGETED THE ALE WHEN ITWAS IS TURNED TO QUESTION WITNESSES HE CALL THE BAVIDIO OF DEBER CALLED WILLSTONES DIRECTOR OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASOCIATIONS OFFICE FOR INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM IN IZUM CALL CALLED WELL STONE HADE BEEN RECORTED ARGURING BOOK ADVOCATES SHOULD REFRAMENT THE BOOK CHALLENGES THI DEBATE SHOULD NOT SENTURN WHETHER TENTLES ARE SEXUALLY AND APPROPRIATE FOR MINOR SAID CALLEDMOSTONE IT SHOULD BE ABOUT DIVERSE MATERIALS THAT ARE ABOUT EVERY ONE'S WRITE SEE THEMSELVES IN THEIR FAMILIES REFLECTED ON BOOKSHELVES WE THEN SAID THE GOAL IS TO SEXUALIZED CHILDREN T OVIDE MINERS WITH SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MATERIAL THAN HIDE THIS CONTENT FROM PARENTS THE ALE A IS NOW FACING A PARTISON FIRE FIGHT UNLIKE ANYTHINGIN ATS ALMOST HUNDRED FIFTY YEAR HISTORY SAYS THE WASHINGTON POST I ONE WHO BROUGHT THAT UP WHO MAY THAT FIREFIGHT HAPPEN I LOVE THAT WE NOW  IT IS A FULL TIME SPORT NOW THE WE WILL DO SOMETHING UNBELIEVABLY TERRIBLE AND PROVOCATIVE AND IF YOU NOTICE YOU'RE THE ONE STARTING A FIREFIGHT THE ONCE UNTR UN CONTROVERSIAL ORGANIZATION WHICH SAYS IT IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST AND OLDEST LIBRARY ASSOCIATION  WHCH PROVIDES FUNNING TRAINING IN TOOLS TO MOST OF THE HUNDRES HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE THOUSAND LIBRARIES HAS BECOME ENTANGLED IN THE EDUCATION CULTURE WARS THE RAGING DEBATES OVER WHAT AND HOW TO TEACH ABOUT RACE SEX ENGENDER CULMINATING IN TUESDYS SENETORIAL NAME CHECK LIKE LEE POLITICIANS AND PARENTS ON THE RIGHT INCREASINGLY PAINTHE SSOCIATION KNOWN AS THE ALE E AS A DEFENDER OF PORNOGRAPHIC LITERATURE FOR CHILDREN TYING THEIR ALLIGATIONS INTO A BROADER CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT THAT ASSERTS SCHOOL LIBRARIES ARE FILLED WITH SEXUALLY EXPLICIT INAPPROPRIATE TEXTS A TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO TWEAT IN WHICH THE ORGANIZATION'S PRESIDENT CALLS HERSELF A MARKSIST LESBIAN ADDED TO THE CONCERN WELL YE THINK YO THING I LOVE THAT SO ITS THAT THE PROBLEM IS NOT THAT THE ALE ISE PRESIDENT CALLS TO SILF A MARKS IST LESBIAN TE PROBLEM IS THAT EVER ANYONE NOTICE THAT SHOU TUEETED THAT OUT PUBLICLY OVER THE STUMER STATE LIBRARIES AND MONTANAMOS ORIAN TEXAS ANNOUNCS THEY WERE SEVERING TIES WITH THE ALE E WHICH IS GOOD THEY SHOULD MEANWHILE LIBRARIANS AND THOSE ON THE POLITICAL LEFT ARE DEFENDING THE ALE E AS A KEEPER VIDER OF MONEY AND SKILLS FOR LIBRARIANS IN PARTICULAR THEY ARE SETTING IN ALE AROPART TRACKING ONE THOUSAND TON AR SIXTY NINE ATTEMPTS TO REMOVE LIBRARY BOOKS IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF CHALLENGES TO BOOKS SINCE THE ALE A BEGAN COMPILING STAFTS ON THE ISSUE WHAT ARE THE ISSUES THEY'RE ALL RELATED TO L G B T WHO PLUS MINUS DIVIDED BY SIGN BOOKS DIRECTED AKIDS WELL GOOD GOOD FOR PARENTS FOR FINALLY WAKING UP AND TAKING NOTICE THE FACT THATHIS I SOMEHOW CONSIDERED IN INSTANCE OF WRITWING RADICALISM IS TRULY AN ASTONISHING AND SILLY THING OKATE TIME FOR A QUICK THING THAT I HATE SO FOR ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO CORRELATION WHATSOEVER BETWEEN POLITICS IDEOLOGY RELIGION AND SEXUAL PRACTICE OR SEXUAL IDENTITY I'M SH CANNOM POINT OUT THAT THAT'S COMPLETELY FALSE THAT IS A LIE IT IS UNTRUE IT WAS ALWAYS UNTRUE THE NOTION THAT SEXUAL ACTIVITY OR SEXUAL IDENTITY ARE INHERENTLY WRITTEN INTO THE DANNA UNCHANGEABLE UNCHANGING NON AFFECTED BY ENVIRONMENT NOT AFFECTED BY BY ANY OTHER MODE OF HUMAN BEHAVIORS IS WRITTEN IN THE SAME WAY THAT MELLON AN LEVEL IS WRITTEN IN DOOUR SKIN THAT'S A LIE BRAN NEW STUDY OUT FROM UM RAD WILCOCKS AND THE FIRE AND RION BURGE IT SHOWS SEXUAL ORIENTATION BI RELIGION AN NOW HEREIS WHAT YOU OUD IMAGI YOU IMAGINE THEIR WOULD NOT BE MAJOR GAPS IN TERMS OF SEXUAL IDENTITY BY RELIGION AND YOU MIGHT IMAGINE SOME GAPS ARE NOT MASSIVE GAPS BECAUSE AFTER ALL I MEAN LIKE YOUOUL IMAGINE THAT IF IT'S BIOLOGICALLY IN GRAIN SEXUAL IDENTITY IN SEXUAL BEHAVIOR BIOLOGIC PURELY BIOLOGICALL INGRAN IT WOULD FALL LIKE THE RAIN UPON ALL EQUALLY BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SEE NOW THE COUNTS ARGUMENT HERE IS THAT PEOPLE ARE LEAVING PERTICULAR FORMES OF RELIGION IF THEY ARE ELG B T KU FOR EXAMPLE AND THEY ARE MOVING INTO OTHER CATEGORIES THAT'S POSSIBLE I DON'T THINK T'S TOTALLY PLAUSIBLE CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THESE GAPS SO FOR EXAMPLE OF YOU ARE MUSLIN EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF MUSLINS IDENTIFY AS STRAIGHT EIGHT PER CENT IDENTIFY AS CONQUOTE SOMETHING ELSE DON'T NO IT SOMETHING ELSE AMOUNCS TO BUT A NEGLI GIBLL PER CENTAGE WRITE THAT EIGHTY FIVE PLUSS EIGHT IS NINETY THREE SEVEN PERCENT IDENTIFIES EITHER GAIN LESBIAN OR BY SEXUAL AMONG PROTESTANTS EIGHTY FOUR PER CENT IDENTIFY IS STRAIT CATHOLICS EIGHTY THREE PER CENT IDENTIFY IS STRAIHT HINDU EIGHTY TWO PER CENT IDENTIFY IS STRAIHT EL D S SEVENTY EIGHT PER CENT IDENTIFY AS STRAIGHT AN THENYOU START GETTING S THE MORE ATHEISTIC RUPS SO JEWISH IS A IS GENERALLY PEOPLE WHO IDENTIFY AS JEWISH VERY OFTEN THERENOT RELIGIOUS NINETY PARTICULAR WAY ONLY SIXTY FIVE PERCENT IDENTIFY IS STRAIHT FIFTEEN PER CENT IDENTIF AS BY SEXUAL SIX PER CENT IDENTIFIES GAINE LESBEEN TWENTY ONE PERCENT PLUS FOURTEEN WHO IDENTIFY AS CONQUOTES SOMETHING ELSE IF YOU ARE AN EIGTHEIST FULLY FORTY FIVE PER CENT OF ETHEISTS SAY THEY ARE NOT STRAIGHT FORTY FIVE PER CENT TELL ME THERE'S NO LINKUAGE BETWEEN ENVIRONMENT IDEOLOGY AND SEXUAL BEHAVIOR AND IDENTITY AT I IT'S ALL BIOLOGICALLY IN GRAIN SURE SURE IT IS IT'S IF THAT THAT LIE WHICH IS WHICH LIES AT THE ROUTE OF THE ENTIRE ELG B T KU MOVEMENTS TO EQUATE ITSELF WITH THE RATIAL CIVIL RITES MOVEMENT HAS BEEN A LIE SINCE INCEPTION AND REMAINS A LIE TO DAY IT IS PURELY A MATTER OF GENETICS AND NEVER MATTER OF ENVIRONMENT AND THA BEHAVIOR ITSELF IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS A BIOLOGICAL COMPONENT LIKE MELON AN IN SKIN ABSOLUTE SILINISOK ONE MORE THING THAT I HATE SO APPARENTLY THE ROLLING STONE COFOUNDER YON WENNER HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME BOARD WHY WHELL HE WROTE A BOOK AND THIS BOOK IS ABOUT A BUNCH OF GREAT ROCKANROL ARTISTS THE PROBEM IS THE PICK SEVEN WHITE DUDES TO PROFILE WHICH IS BAD APPARENTLY OU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT BECAUSE HE WAS ASKED ABOUT IT AND OM HE WAS ASKED TO QUOTE ACKNOWLEDGE THET PER FORMENCE OF COLOR AND WOMEN PER FORMERS ARE JUST NOT IN YOUR LIKEGISE AND WENNER SAID IN SO FAR AS THE WOMEN JUST NONE OF THEM ERE AS ARTICULATE ON THIS INTELLECTUAL LEVEL AND THAT NONE OF THE FEMALE OR BLACK MUSICIANS MEAT HIS CRITERIA AS PHILOSOPHERS OF ROCK RATHER THAN JUST CREATIVE GENIUSES THIS PROVOKES A MAGE REACTION HE SAID AT ONE POINT YOU KNOW JUST FOR PUBLIC RELATION SAKE MAYBE I SHOUL HAVE GONE AND FOUND ONE BLACK IN ONE WOMAN ARTIST TO INCLUDE HERE THAT DIDN'T MEASURE UP TO THAT SAME HISTORICAL STANDARD JUST TO AVERT THIS KIND OF CRITICISM MISTER RUNNER'S COMMENTS ACCORDING TO THE NEAR TIMES TROUGHANIMMEDIATE REACTION WITH HIS QUOTES MOCKS ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND PAST CRITICISMS ON EARTH OF ROLLINGSTONES COVERED TO FEMALE ARTISTS UNDER WINNER AND A THE ROCK AN ROLL HOLLIFAME HAS NOW EFFECTIVELY KICKED HIM OFF SO THAT IS  THAT IS WHAT THEY DO NOW SO L IS SO IN OTHER WORDS IT TURNS OUT THAT THE SEVEN MEN THAT HE PICKES HE THINGS FER THE BEST THE AND UT BEING SEVEN WHITE MEN HE'S NOT AYIG THAT WOMENARENOT CAPABLE OF BEING GREAT ARTISTS HE'S NOT SAYING THAT BLACK PEOPLE ARE NOT CAPABLE OF BEING PHILOSOPHERS OF ROCK HE SAYING THAT THE SEVEN PHILOSOPHERS OF ROCK WHO ARE THE BEST ARE NOT BLACKEN ARE NOT WOMEN I'M NOT SURE WHY THAT IS LIKE SUPER DUPER CRAZY MAYBE THAT'S THE WAY HE SEES IT OTHERS CAN OBVIOUSLY DISAGREE BUT THAT'S THAT L IF YOU ARE ASKED TO NAME TO DAY WHO ARE THE GREATEST CLASSICAL COMPOSERS OF ALL TIME AN YOU'RE LIKE BETOVEN BOCH BRAHMS MODZART ALL WHITE MEN DOES THIS MAKE YOU SOME SORT OF ANTI FEMINIST RADICAL OR ANTI BLACK RADICAL WOU'RE NOT EVEN SAYING THAT IF GIVEN THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES THERE WOULDN'T HAV BEEN A BLACK BATOVEN YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT BETOVEN WAS THE BEST HAL IRON IRON ON UNDERSTAND THE CRITIQUE BUT THAT'S THE WAY THAT IT WORKS HE'S RIGHT BY THE WAY IF YOUAD JUST PLACED ONE BLACK WOMAN IN THE COMPENDIUM EVERYBODYBD LEFT HIM ALONE WHICH IS TRULY ANINCREDIBLE THING

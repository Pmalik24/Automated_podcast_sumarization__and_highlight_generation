WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LATPONCAS  OF SCIENCE SCIENCE SPACES TO E FOR I MA INDRHUBERMEN AND O'M A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND ALTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE DISCUSSING CANABAS ALSO REFERRED TO AS MAROWANA CANABAS INCLUDES MANY DIFFERENT COMPOUNDS THAT HAVE PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE BRAIN AND BODY SO WHILE MANY OF YOU PROBABLY HEARD OF T H C THERE ARE ALSO COMPOUNDS IN CANABAS SUCH AS C B D AND OF COURSE THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OR STRAINS OF CANABAS INCLUDING SETEVA STRAINS AND INDICA STRAINS AND HYBRID STRAINS AND BELIEVE OUARE NOT NOWADAYS THERE IS ALSO AN ENTIRE LITERATURE MEANING A SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICINAL LITERATURE ABOUT TYPE ONE TYPE TO INTYPE THREE STRAINS I'LL EXPLAIN WHAT ALL OF THAT IS AND HOW THEY WORK I'LL TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE MEDICINAL APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENT STRAINS OF CANABAS AND COMBINATIONS OF CANABAS STRAINS AS WELL AS SOME OF THE POTENTIAL HEALTH HAZARDS OF CANABAS USE I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT CANABAS HAS TO BE FRAINED WITHIN THE CONTECT THAT THE LEGALITY OF CANABAS VARIES TREMENDOUSLY DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE IN THE WORLD SO DEPENDING ON WHICH COUNTRY YOURE IN AND EVEN WHICH STATE YOURE IN OR WHICH ARIA WITHIN A COUNTRY POSSESSING AND USING AND CERTAINLY SELLING CANABAS CAN BE EITHER HIGHLY ILLEGAL OR ENTIRELY LEGAL OR DECRIMINALIZED OR LARGELY OVERLOOKED YOU OF COURSE SURE OBLIGATED TO KNOW WHAT THOSE LOCAL LAWS ARE FOR YOU WHERE YOU LIVE AND WHERE YOU TRAVEL WITH THAT SAID TO DAY'S DISCUSSION REALLY WILL INCLUDE A FULL PICTURE AS TO WHERE CANABAS AND THE VARIOUS AND EVEN VERY SPECIFIC COMPOUNDS WITHIN CANABAS CAN BE EXTREMELY USEFUL IN THE TREATMENT OF SOME AILMENTS AND WHERE CERTAIN COMPOUNDS IN CANBAS CAN BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS FOR CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS TO USE IN PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE PRE EXISTING GENETIC PROPENSITY FOR CYCHOSIS THAT THEME IS GOING TO COME UP AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT WE ARE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE ROLE OF CANABAS IN ANXIETY IN DEPRESSION BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS WILL TALK ABOUT SEX DIFFERENCES AND TERMS OF WOMEN VERSES MEN AND HOW THEY REACT DIFFERENTLY TO CANABAS AND I WOULD BE ENTIRELY REMISS IF I DIDN'T INCLUDE A CONVERSATION ABOUT CANABAS MEANING T H C C B D HYBRID STRAINS ET CETERA IN CREATIVITY AND DIFFERENT MODES OF THINKING BECAUSE AS MANY OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW OR AT LEAST HAVE HEARD ABOUT CANABAS KIN IMPACT THE WAY THAT WE THINK THE TYPES OF MEMORY SYSTEMS WE CAN ACCESS ANDWHAT'S CALLED CONVERGENT AND DIVERGENT THINKING WHICH IS ONE WAY OF CONCEPTIALIZING WHAT IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS CREATIVITY SO TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS GOING TO INCLUDE A LOT OF INFORMATION BUT I PROMISE TO MAKE IT CLEAR IN ACCESSIBLE TO ALL OF YOU REGARDLESS OF WHEATHER NOT YOU HAVE A BACKGROUND AND BIOLOGY OR NOT AND TODAY'S DISCUSSION WILL ALSO BE QUITE NUANTS YOU'LL FIND ME ROUTINELY READING DIRECTLY FROM SPECIFIC RESEARCH PAPER SOMETHING THAT OF COURSE WE ALWAYS DO ON THIS PODCAST BUT TO DAY A'M REALLY GOING TO DIG INTO SOME OF THE FINER POINTS OF THE ME T THEDOLOGYAN PAPERS AND SOME OF THE STATISTICS THAT WERE USED AND THE SPECIFIC POPULATIONS OF PEOPLE THAT WERE STUDY BECAUSE IS IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE INSTANCES THAT WE WILL DISCUSS IN WHICH THE USE OF CANABUSTS CAN BE IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL TO ONE GROUP AND YET CAN BE ENTIRELY DETRIMENTAL TO ANOTHER GROUP EVEN AT EQUIVALENT DOSAGES AND DEPENDING ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS SO WE WILL DISCUSS WHAT THOSE FACTORS ARE JUST TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF OVER VIEW OF THE KIND OF STRUCTURUMMING A PUT ON TO DAY'S EPISODE WE WILL REVIEW OF COURSE CANABUSTS AND ITS VARIOUS FORMS I'LL TOLK ABOUT SOME OF THE BIOLOGY BUT WE ARE GOING TO REALLY DRILL IN TO HOW DOSAGE THAT IS THE CONCENTRATION OF T H C RELATIVE TO C B D IMPACTS WHETHER R NOT CANABUS IS GOING TO HAVE ONE EFFECT OR ANOTHER WE WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT THE FREQUENCY OF USE DAILY USE MULTIPLE TIMES PER DAY USE WEEKLY USE ARE MONTHLY OR OCCASIONAL USE WE WILLALSO TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT PROFESSIONS AND HOW SOME PEOPLE MAY HAVE A LITTLE IT MORE LEEWAY IN TERMS OF WHETHEROR NOT THEY DECIDE TO USE CANABUSTS OR ANY OF ITS VARIOUS COMPONENT CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS THAT IS S B D OR T H C ET CETERA AND FOR OTHER PROFESSIONS IT MIGHT BE ENTIRELY INAPPROPRIATE BECAUSE OF THE PARTICULAR KINDS OF COGNIVE TASS THOSE PROFESSIONS DEMAND WE WIL ALLSO TALK ABOUT GYNETIC PREDISPOSITION AGAIN SEX DIFFERENCES HORMONE EFFECTS AND I WILL ALSO TOUCH ON WHAT I THINK AS THE MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLE IN DETERMINING WEATHER R NOT CANABUS IS RIGHT OR WRONG FOR YOU AND THAT IS YOUR AGE AT WHICH YOU ARE CONSIDERING STARTING OR CONTINUING USE OR CEASING USE WHAT I CAN ASSURE YOU IS THAT BY THE END OF TO DAY'S PODCAST YOU WILL HAVE A QUITE THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF CANABUS HOW IT WORKS WHAT IT DOES WHAT ITS POTENTIAL BENEFITS CAN BE WHAT ITS POTENTIAL HAZARDS ARE AND WHETHER NOT ITS RIGHT FOR YOU AND THE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW BEFORE WE BEGIN I LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS IT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZEROCOSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR NOW SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLITES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLIKE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHISITS IN COGNITIVE END PHYSICAL PERFORMANTS ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACTOELECTROLITE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT ONE GRAM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDER MILIGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KINOPHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I HAVE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT TYOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT DACOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT ELEEMENT DACCOM SLASH HUBERMAN LET'S TALK ABOUT CANABAS AND WHEN WE REFER TO CANABAS WE ARE INDEED REFERRING TO MAROWANA OR THE MAROWANA PLANTS CANABUS PLANTS COME IN DIFFERENT STRAINS OR DFFERENT VARIETIES AND THOSE DIFFERENT STRAINS ARE INDEED DIFFERENT GENETIC STRAINS JUST AS ANIMALS AND HUMANS HAVE DIFFERENT GENETIC BACKGROUNDS AND THEY CAN BE CROSS TO ONE ANOTHER TO YIELD FURTHER GENETIC VARIATION IN THE OFFSPRING PLANTS CAN BE HYBRODIZED TO ONE ANOTHER IN VARIOUS WAYS THROUGH GRAFTING OR THROUGH THE USE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF C COMMINATIONS ET CETERA IN ORDER TO GENERATE DIFFERENT STRAINS THERE ARE ALSO NATURALLY OCCURRING DIFFERENCES IN THE STRAINS OF PLANTS AND THE CANABUS PLANT IS NO EXCEPTION SO FOR INSTANCE IN THE CONTECTS OF THE DISCUSSION ABOUT CANABAS AND ITS MEDICINAL USES AND RECREATIONAL USES WE NEED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEE THE CETVA VARIETY THE INTICA VARIETY A VARIETY CALLD RUDERALIS THAT'S NOT OFTEN DISCUSS AND HYBRIDS OF CETIVA INDICA AND RUDERALUS BEFORE DIVING INTO THE DIFFERENT STRAINS OF CANABUS AND HOW THEY IMPACTI BRAIN AND BODY BOTH SIMILARLY AND DIFFERENTLY I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE CANABUS PLANT CONTAINS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PSYCHOACT OF COMPOUNDS NAND THE MOST POWERFUL OF THOSE COMPOUNDS IS T H C THE TECHNICAL NAME FOR IT IS DELTANINE TETROHYDRO CANABANL BUT T H C AS ILL REFERRED TO IT IS JUST ONE OF THE PSYCHOACTIVE AND BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE COMPOUNDS WITHIN CANABUS PLANTS THERE IS ALSO C B D WHICH IS TECHNICALLY REFERRED TO AS CANABADIAL AND CANABADYAL C B D IS KNOWN TO BE USED FOR THINGS LIKE PAINMANAGEMENT ANXIETY MANAGEMENT AND OTHER MEDICINAL PURPOSES WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE EFFICACY OF C B D FOR THOSE PURPOSES AS WELL AS SOME OF BELIEVEIT ARE NOT SOME OF THE DANGERS OF C B D DEPENDING ON WHERE IT SOURCE THAN THE DOSAGE ET CETERA SWE'VE GOT T H C C B D AND ALSO C B N OR CANABANAL C B N IS LESS OFTEN DISCUSSED YOURE GOING TO HERE A LOT LESS ABOUT C B N CONTAINING PRODUCTS OUT THERE C B N CONTAINING MEDICINES BUT IT IS RELEVANT TO TO DAY'S DISCUSSIONS WILLL COME UP A BIT NOW I WILL BE SURE TO PROVIDE MORE SPECIFICITY TO WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY BUT VERY BROADLY SPEAKING T H C IS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PSYCHOACTIV EFFECTS OF CANABAS THAT IS THE CHANGES AND MOOD THE CHANGES IN BODILY STATE AND SENSATION ET CETERA WHEREAS C B D AND TO SOME EXTENT C B N HAVE PROFOUND EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN AND BODY BUT THEY DON'T TEND TO GIVE PEOPLE THE SENSATION OF ALTERED PERCEPTION ALTERED MOOD ET CETERA SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY THEY ARE NOT THE COMPONENT OFE CANABAS THAT QUOTENQO GETS U HIGH ALTHOUGH TODAY WE WILL REALLY DRILL INTO WHAT THE HIGH ITSELF REPRESENTS AND TERMS OF CHEMICAL SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND WHAT WE WILL SOON LEARN IS THAT WHAT WE THINK OF AS BEING HIGH ACTUALLY INCLUDES A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CHANGES IN THE BRAIN AN BODY SOME OF WHICH CAN BE BEST EXPLAINED BY C B D NOT BY T H C WHICH RUNS COUNTER TO WHAT MOST PEOPLE OUT THERE NO AND BELIEF SO BROADLY SPEAKING WE HAVE T H C C BD AND C B N BUT I WANT A POINT OUT THAT THE CANABAS PLANT HAS OVER SEVENTY SEVEN ZERO SEVENTY DIFFERENT PSYCHOACTIVE COMPOUNDS MANY OF WHICH STILL HAVE NOT BEEN STUDIED IN ISOLATION AND IN DETAIL SO THERES A BIG FUTURE OF RESEARCH FOR CANABAS AND FOR T H C AND T H C RELATED PSYCHOACTIVE COMPOUNDS AS WELL AS FOR SEBED AND C BEN TO DAY WE'RE MAINLY GOING TO FOCUS ON T H C AND C BD AS I MENTION BEFORE I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE CANABAS PLANT HAS OVER FOUR HUNDRED BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE COMPOUNDS SO THESE ARE BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE COMPOUNDS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE PSYCHOACTIVE PROPERTIES THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE USEFUL FOR PAIN RELIEF ET CETERA AGAIND THERE IS A VAST LANDSCAPE FOR EXPLORATION OF THE CANABAS PLANT AND OF HEMP FOR WHAT THEY INCLUDE THAT COULD BE BENEFICIAL TO US ARE DETRIMENTAL TO US SO  YAN LOT MORE WORK TO DO TO DAY WE'RE GOING TO REALLY TRY AND STAY ON TARGET WITH WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW AND WHERE THERE ARE CERTAIN EXCITING MYSTERIES WERE INTRIGUING MYSTERIES ABOUT WHAT WE OUGHT TO EXPLORE MORE I WILL CERTAINLY HIGHLIKE THOSE LET'S GO BACK TO THE DIFFERENT STRAINS OF THE CANAAS PLANT SETIVA INDICA AND RHUDERALIS AND EXPLORE HOW EACH OF THOSE DIFFERENTIALLY IN PACTS THE BRAIN AND BODY BECAUSE THEREIN I THINK WE CAN START TO LEARN A LOT ABOUT THIS INCREDIBLE PLANT THAT IS THE CANABAS PLANT AND WHETHER R NOT YOU ARE A USER OF CANABAS OR WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE ENTIRELY OPPOSED TO CANABAS USE UNDERSTANDING HOW CANABAS WORKS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY ITSELF IS ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING AND CAND TEACH YOU A LOT ABOUT HOW YOUR BRAIN ANBODY WORK AT A BASIC LEVEL AND CAN TELL YOU A LOT ABOUT HOW YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WILL REACT TO DIFFERENT LIFE EVENTS AND HOW YOURE MOOD IS ESTABLISHED IN STABLIZED AND HOW YOUR APPETITE IS ESTABLISHED IN STABILIZED AND SO ON SO WE HAVE THE THREE MAJOR STRAINS OF CANABAS SETIVA INDICA AND RUDERALIS AND FOR SAKE OF TO DAY'S CONVERSATION WE CAN PO MUCH CROSS OFF RHUDERALIS ITS NOT OFTEN CONSUMED AND COMPONENTS OF RUDERALIS ARE NOT OFTEN CONSUMED FOR MADICINAL OR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES LET'S FOCUS ON SATIVA AND INDICA PEOPLE WILL CONSUME THE SETIVA VARIETY OF CANABAS EITHER BY EDIBLE OR BY SMOKING CANABAS OR THEY WILL CONSUME THE INDICA VARIETY OF CANABAS AGAIN BY EDIBL OR BY SMOKIND CANABAS OR SOMETIMES THEY WILL TAKE IT IN A TRANSDERMAL FORM OR SUBLINGUAL FORM THEIR BUNCH OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET THE CANIBUS INTO THE BODY BUT THERE IS A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN SATIVA AND INDICA THAT ACTUALLY SHOWS UP FIRST IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE PLANT AT THEIRE EXTREMES MEANING IN A PURE STRAIN OF SETIVA IT TENDS TO BE A TALLER PLANT THA LONGER STACK BELIEVE IT OR NOT AND ACTUALLY THE LENGTH OF THE LEAVES IS QUITE A BIT LONGER WHEREAS THE INDICA PLANTENDS TO BE RE SHORT AND STOUT AND FOR THOSE FICIONATOS OUT THERE I'MSURE YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE OTHER SPECIFIC FEATURES OF SETIVA VERSES IN DICA BUT ALREADY WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT IS THE SAME PLANT CANIBUS WITH TWO VERY DIFFERENT MORPHOLOGIES OR SHAPES MY SIVL WISES INTERESTING OR IM PORTANT TO NOW HOW IT AFFECTS ME OR AFFECTS OTHER PEOPLE FOR MUDICINAL RECREATIONAL PURPOSES WILL TURNS OUT THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE THE SAME PLANT THESE TWO DIFFERENT GUNETIC VARIETIES BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THEY GROW AND THE WAY THEY CAPTURE SUNLIGHT AND THE WAY BELIEVE OR NOT THAT THE DIFFERENT PLANTS WITHIN THAT STRAIN INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER CAUSE BELIEVE IT OR NOT PLANTS ARE INTERACTING WITH ONE ANOTHER THEY ACTUALLY BRING DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THE PSYCHOACTOF COMPOUNDS TO DIFFERENT COMPONENTS WITHIN THE LEAVES ON THE SO CALLED BOODS THE TAKE AWAY IS THAT WHEN CONSUMED AND WHEN I SAY CONSUMED I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR I DON'T NECESSARILY JUST MEAN ORAL CONSUMPTION OR EATING CANIBUS SETIVA B EDIBAL I ALSO MEAN SMOKING IT AND THAT CA BE YOU KNOW PEOPLE WILL JUST LIKE WITH TOBACCO THE WAY THAT THEY BRING THE PSYCHOACTIV COMPONENTS INTO THEIR BLOOD STREAM AND INTO THEIR BRAIN AND BODY IS TO ESENTULY HEAT THE DRIED LEAVES OF THE CANIBUS PLANT THEN THE HEAT LIBERATES SOME OF THE PSYCHOACTIVE COMPONENTS THAT WHEN INHAILED INTO THE LUNGS BECAUSE THE LUNGS INCLUDE A LOT OF VASCULATURE LOT OF THESICALLY BLOOD VESSELS AND CAPULARIES THAT THE PSYCHOACTIV COMPONENTS ARE ACTUALLY DIRECTLY ABSORBED FROM THE LUNGS INTO THE BLOOD STREAM AND THEY CAN CROSS INTO THE BLOOD STREAM END PERMEATE THROUGHOUT THE BODY AND CROSS THE SO CALLE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER SO IN OTHER WORDS BURNING THE PLANT LIBERATES THE SMOKE THAT CONTAINS THE PSYCHOACTIVE COMPOUNDS AND THOSE ARE INHALED INTO THE LUNGS AND THEN GET INTO THE BRAIN AND BODY AND ACT ON THE BRAIN AND BODY AND THE MAJOR EFFECT OF SATIVA VARIETIES ARE TO CREATE A HIGH IF YOU WILL AND UPING THESS AN AIRQUOTS FOR THOSE WHO THEIR LISTENING BUT TO ALSO ACT IS A STIMULANT THE SETIVA VARIETIES TEND TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL KIND OF INVIGORATED SOMEWHAT ALERT IT DOESN 'TTEND TO BE AS MUCH OF A SEDITIVE AS SOME OF THE OTHER VARIETIES SOME PEOPLE REPORT HEIGHTENE SENSE OF FOCUS OR HEIGHTENED SENSE OF CREATIVITY WEILL TALK A ABIT LATER ON AS TO WHETHER NOT THEY ACTUALLY ARE ACHIEVING HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF FOCUS AND CREATIVITY OR WHETHER NOT THEY JUST PERCEIVE THEMSELVES TO HAVE HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF FOCUS IN CREATIVITY THE SETIVA VARIETIES TEND TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL A LITTLE BIT LESS SECEPTIBLE TO PAIN AND NOXIOUS STIMULE WHICH ARE BASICALLY STIMULE THAT YOU DON'T LIKE SO THE SETIVAARIETIES AR FTEN PERSCRIBED OR ARE USED IN THE RECREATIONAL CONTACT FOR PAINMANAGEMENT AND RELIEF BAY SICALLY THE SATIVA ARIETY IS KNOWN TO INCLUDE A SORT OF HEAD BIASED EFFECT SO A HERE WERE TALKING ABOUT SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS AND OF COURSE THESE WILL VARY FROM ONE INDIVIDUAL TO THE NECT SOME PEOPLE WILL SMOKE CANABAS SATIVARE IN JEST CANABA SETIVA ORLY AND WILL FEEL AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ARAY OF A FACTS BUT MOST PEOPLE THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE EXPERINTS A SORT OF HEAD SENTERED HIGH ALERTNESS FOCUS AND A SENSE TAT THEIR MORE CREATIVE CONTRAST THAT WITH THE INDICA VARIETIES OF CANABAS AND WHEN PEOPLE SMOKE OR EAT ER IN JEST INDICA VARIETIES THE SYCHOACTIVE COMPONENTS OF INDICA AND AGAIN THIS IS PURE INDICA SO NOT HYBRODIZED WITH SETIVADABAGE IS PURINDICA TEND TO LEAD TO MORE FULL BODIED EFFECTS PEOPLE REPORT FEELING MORE COMPLETE FULL BODY RELAXATION MORE OF A SETVOV FECT INDICA CANABAS IS OFTEN PESCRIBED AND ORE USED RECREATIONALLY IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A STATE OF SLEEP OR TO HELP RELIEVE ANXIETY SO LESS OF A STIMULANT EFFECT AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHY LITERALLY THE UNDERLINE NERAL CIRCUITS THAT LEAD TO THE SATIVA VARIETY CAUSING MORE OF A ELEVATED MOOD AND A HEAD HIGH IF YOU WILL AND THE INDICA VARIETIES BEING MORE FULL BODY RELAXATION ONE OF THE WAYS TO REMEMBER THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE EFFECTS OF CANABAS SATIVA AND CANABAS INDICA WAS RELATE TO ME BY A FRIEND MASHI WAS A CHRONIC MEANING EVERY DAY ALL DAY A CONSUMER OF MARIWANAS E BASELY SMOKE MARWUAN FOR TWENTY YEARS BEFORE QUITTING ABOUT FOR FIVE YEARS AGO HE SAID THAT A INDICA IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS INDICOUCH MEANING LAID BACK IN THE COUCH AM AND THAT CAN HELP YOU REMEMBER THAT THE INDICA VARIETIES OF CANABAS DU TEND TO BE MORE SEDATIVE IN THEIR EFFECTS O CASE OF THERE SATIVA AND THERE'S INDICA AND THEN NOW THERE ARE HYBRID STRAINS SO MAROWANA GROWERS AND PEOPLE WHO SPECIALIZE IN CREATING NOVEL VARIETIES OF THE CANABAS PLANT GAN AMUSING THE WORDS CANABASIN MARAWANA MORE LESS INTERCHANGEABLY HERE THEY ARE VERY GUIDAT CREATING NEW STRAINS OF PLANT THAT MIGHT BE TWENTY FIVE PER CENT SATIVA AND SEVENY FIVE PER CENT INDICA VICE VERSE OR FIFTY FIFTY OR NINETY TEN ESSENTIALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING NOWADAYS IS THAT THROUGH PLANTBIOLOGY PLANTGUNETICS I SHOULD SAY GROWERS ARE GETTING QUITE EFFICIENT AT CREATING A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT STRAINS OF THE MARAWANA PLANT THEY GIVE RISE TO VERY NUANT AND DISTINCT EFFECTS ON BRAIN AND BODY IN FACT SO MUCH SO THAT THERE'S NOW A NEW NOMEN CLATUR A NEW LANGUAGE EMERGING AROUND CANABAS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL STRAINS OF CANABAS FOR MEDISINAL AND OR ECREATIONAL PURPOSES AND WHILE THIS MIGHT SOUND A LITTLE BUT MEDICAL OR A LITTLE BAT CLINICAL TO SOME PEOPLE LEAVE ARE NOT THIS IS THE NOMEN CLATURE THAT IS NOW TYPICALLY USED PEOPLE STILL REFER TO THE SATIVA INDICA AND HYBRID STRAINS BUT THERE'S NOW ALSO A DESCRIPTION OF SO CALLE TYPE ONE TYPE TO AND TYPE THREE STRAINS FOR ANY GIVEN SATIVA INDICA OR HYBRID STRIN A KYSO JUST TO PUT THIS CLEARLY IN YOUR MIND YOU'VE GOT SETIVA VARIETIES THAT IS PURE SETIVA VARIETIES YOU HAVE INDICA VARIETIES AND PURE INDICA AND THEN YOU HAVE HYBRID VARIETIES AND BENEATH EACHER THOSE YOU HAVE TYPE ONE TYPE TO AND TYPE THREE STRAINS OF INDICA SETIVA OR HYBRID VARIETIES WHAT ARE TYPE ONE TYPE TO AND TYPE THREE WELL TYPE ONE TYPE TO AND TYPE THREE STRAINS OR STRAINS THAT HAVE VERYING AMOUNTS OR RATIOS OF T H C TO C B D SO FOR INSTANCE TYPE ONE STRAIN SO FOR INSTANCE YOU COULD HAVE A PURE SATIVA TYPE ONE OR A TYPE ONE PURE SATIVA OR A TYPE ONE INDICA THOSE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF T H C RELATIVE TO C B D AND I REALLY ONE TO EMPHASIZE THIS UNDERSTANDING THE RATIO OF T H C TO C B D CAN HELP EXPLAIN A LOT OR EVEN PREDICT A LOT ABOUT HOWA GIVEN STRAIN OF CANABAS WILL IMPACT SOMEBODY FOR INSTANCE BECAUSE T H C IS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THET TYPICAL CYCHOACTIVE COMPONENTS OF CANABAS SO WHAT I MEAN HERE IS IF SOMEBODY'S IN GESTING SAEIVA AND IT ROUTINELY MAKES THEM A FEEL MORE ENERGIZED ELEVATES THEIR MOOD GIVES THEM A HEIGHTENED STANCE OF CREATIVITY F THAT'S WHAT THEY EXPERIENCE AND THERE TAKING A TYPE ONE VERSION OF THAT THAT MEANS THAT IT'S QUITE RICH IN T H C AND VERY LITTLE C B D HOWEVER IF THEY WERE TO TAKE A TYPE ONE VERSION OF SATIVA AND IT FEELS FAR TOO STRONG LIKE TOO MUCH ENERGY OR THEY FELT EITHER TOO MUCH IN THEIR HEAD NOWADAYS THERE ARE STRAINS OF SAETIVA THAT HAVE BEEN GENETICALLY ENGINEERED AND I DON'T MEAN BY AN ENGINEER TINKERING AWAY WITH A UNOGENI ENGINEERING IN A KIND OF CRISPER MU CREATING MUTES BUT LITERALLY BY HYBRODIZING CROSSING DIFFERENT PLANTS TO ONE ANOTHER E CREATING IN IT IN A NATURAL CONTECT THE SAME WAY PLANTS IN THE IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD WOULD SOMETIMES HYBRADIZE TO ONE ANOTHER CREATING A VARIETY THAT'S PERHAPS TYPE TWO WHICH IS GOING TO HAVE LESS T H C AND MORE C B D OR A TYPE THREE WHICH IS GOING TO BE VERY HYGH C B D AND VERY LITTLE T H C AND THE SAME IS ALSO TRUE FOR THE INDICA VARIETIES SO ONETO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY ONE UNDERSTANDS THIS BECAUE IT BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING THE BIOLOGY OF CANABAS AND PREDICTING POSITIVERSES NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CANABAS SETIVA HAS THIS KIND OF STIMULANT LIKE A FACT INTENDS TO BE MORE OF A HEAD HIGH IF YOU WILL INDICA TENDS TO BE MORE FULL BODY THAN LEAD TO MORE INDICOUCH AS I REFER TO IT BEFORE OF PONN TENDED DEEP RELAXATION REDUCE IN SOMNEA ET CETERA NOW WITHIN EACH OF THOSE SETIVAN INDICA YOU HAVE TYPE ONE TYPE TO IN TYPE THREE AND THAT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH HOW MUCH T H C WHICH IS THE DOMINANT CSYCHOACTIVE COMPOUND VERSES C B D WHICH HAS OTHER EFFECTS MAINLY ON THE BODY BUT NOT SO MUCH ON THE BRAIN AND MODES OF THINKING AND MOOD ET CETERA HOW MUCH T H C VER SE C B D AS PRESENT AND AGAIN TYPE ONE IS T H C DOMINANT TYPE TOO OF EQUAL RATIOES IF YOU WILL OF T H C AND C BED AND TYPE THREETEND TO BE HIGH C B D CASO ALREADY WE'VE GOT SOME CATEGRIZATION HERE THAT HOPEFULLY ISN'T OVERWHELMING TO YOU BUT THIS TURNS OUT TO BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IF YOU WANT UNDERSTAND HOW CANABUS WORKS AND PREDICT THE EFFECTS OF CANABAS O CASO SOMEWHAT SURPRISINGLY WE'RE GOING TO SET ASIDE CANABUS WERE GOAN TAKE WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT SETIVA INDICA TYPE ONE TYPE TO ULD TYPE THREE C B D ET CETERA WHICH CAN SET THAT ASIDE FOR A MOMENT WHY WOULD WE DO THAT WELL WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHY WOULD ANY OF THESE PLANTS WHY WOULD ANY OF THESE COMPOUNDS T H C C B D SETIVA INDICA ET CETERA WHY WOULD ANY OF THAT HAVE ANY EFFECT ON US AT ALL AND THIS DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO HAVE VERY MUCH RESEMBLS THE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD ON A PREVIOUS EPISODE ABOUT NICOTINE BECAUSE AS MANY OF YOU KNOW NICOTINE IS A COMMONLY USE SUBSTANCE IN FACT IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT THE THREE MOST COMMONLY USED DRUGS ALCOHOL WOULD BE THE TOP OF THE LIST MANY BILLIONS OF PEOPLE REGULARLY USE ALCOL OR OCCASIONALLY USE ALCHOLL NMANY BILLIONS OF PEOPLE ALSO USE NICOTINE IT'S THE SECOND MOST CONSUMED DRUG MORE THAN ONE BILLION AND PROBABLY CLOS OR TWUBILLION PEOPLE CONSUMED NICOTINE AND THEN THE THIRD MOST CONSUMED DRUG IS CANABAS IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER MANY OF YOU ARE PRBABLY SHOUTING WHAT ABOUT CAFFINE WHAT ABOUT CAFFINE WILL IN THE CONTECT OF DRUGS AND IN PRETULAR ADDICTIVE DRUGS CAFFINE DOESN'T QUITE RISE TO THE LIST BUT IF WEWERE TO LOOK AT CAFFINE AND INCLUDING THAT LISS CAFFINE WOULD BE ABOVE ALL OF THOSE O CAPE BUT TH MOST COMMONLY USE DRUGS ARE ALCHOL SECOND AFTER THAT IS NICOTINE AND THEN CANABAS NICOTINE AS SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW IF YOU LISTEN TO THE EPISODE ON NICTINE BUT EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T NICKOTINE COMES FROM THE TOBACCO PLANT AND THERE FEW OTHER PLANTS THAT INCLUDE NICOTINE AND TYPICALLY IT'S BROUGHT INTO THE BRAIN AND BODY BY SMOKING TOBACCO DIPPING TOBACCO SNUFFING TOBACCO OR VAPING NICCOTINE NICOTINE EXIST IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN THESE PLANTS THE TOBACCO PLANTS BUT THE REASON IT HAS AN EFFECT ON THE BODY IS THAT THERE ARE SO CALLED NICOTINIC RECEPTERS IN THE BODY NOW THOSE NICOTINIC RECEPTORS WERE NAMED AFTER NICOTINE THE COMPOUND BUT THE EXISTED IN THE BRAIN AND BODY NOT BECAUSE OF THE EXISTENCE OF A TOBACCO PLANT BUT BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER CHEMICALS IN THE BODY THAT NATURALLY OCCUR NAMELY A CTAL COALINE THAT BINE THE NICCOTINE RECEPTER THOSE CHEMICALS SUCH AS HA SEETO CALLING THE BIND THE NICOTINIC RECEPTER IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY CREATE IN HENT SENSE A FOKIS ET CETERAT CETERA BUT NICOTINE FROM TOBACCO BINDS THAT SAME RECEPTOR BUT WITH MUCH GREATOR AFFINITY AND THEREFORE ALSO CREATES A STATE OF FOCUS BUT A MUCH GREATER ONE THAN WE CAN ACHIEVE WITHOUT NICOTINE CASWY CAN SEE THE NICOTINE EPISODE IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT IN A VERY SIMILAR WAY ALL OF OUR BRAINS AND BODIES FROM THE TIME THAT WE ARE CONCEIVED BELIEVE IT ARE NOT VERY SHORTLY AFTER CONCEPTION IF WE WANT TO BE ACCURATE VERY EARLY CONCEPTION WHEN YOU WERE IN THE WOMB AND STILL NOW IF YOU'RE LISTENING TO THIS YOU HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED CANABINOID RECEPTORS BECAUSE YOU ALSO HAVE INDOGENOUS CANABANOIS WHAT WE MEAN BY THAT YOU HAVE RECEPTORS WHICH ARE LIKE LITTLE PARKING SPOTS THAT ARE PRESENT ON CELLS IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY AND WHAT WE CALL A LIGAN WHICH IS BAYIG JUST A CHEMICAL THAT'S RELEASED PARKS IN THAT RECEPTER AND CAUSES A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS CANIBUS CONTAINS COMPOUNDS THAT ALSO BIND TO THOSE RECEPTORS BUT HERE I WANT OR MAKE A REALLY CLEAR DISTINCTION WE HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED IN DOGENOUS LAGENS THOSE THAT JUST MEAN CHEMICALS FROM WITHIN US THAT WE MAKE NATURALLY EVEN IF WE NEVER GO NEAR THE CANABUS PLANT OR ANY OTHER SOURCE OF CANAIBUS WE HAVE CHEMICALS THAT ARE CREATED IN US THAT PARK IN THOSE RECEPTORS AND CAUSE BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS ON MOOD ON PERCEPTION ON THE IMUNE SYSTEM ON HUNGER ET CETERA AGAIN WITHOUT EVER GOING ANYWHERE NEAR CANABUS WE HAVE THESE INDOGENOUS CANABINOIS INDOGENOUS CANABINOIDS ARE FLOATING AROUND IN US OR I SHOULD SAY THEY ARE RELEASED IN US IN PARTICULAR WAYS BIND THESE RECEPTORS AND CAUSE CHANGES IN MOOD APPETITE ET CETERA THEYHAVE MANY DIFFEREN EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN AND BODY WEILL TALK ABOUT THOS BUT JUST LIKE WITH NICOTINE THERE ARE SUBSTANCES IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN THIS CASE CANIBUS CONTAINS THESE SUBSTANCES TO THINGS LIKE T H C AND LIKE C B D THAT WHEN INGESTED BY SMOKING OR VAPING OR BY INGESTING ETIBALS ALSO WILL PARK IN THOSE SAME RECEPTORS THE CANABINOID RECEPTORS AND LEAD TO BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS NOW IT'S A LITLABAT MISLEADING BECAUSE WE CALL THEM CANABINOID RECEPTORS AS IF THEY WERE THERE TO BIND CANIBUS OR JUST LIKE WE ALL THE NICOTINE RECEPTORS NICOTINIC RECEPTORS IT MAKES IT SEEM AS IF THEY WERE THERE IN ORDER TO BIND NICOTINE FROM TOBACCO BUT THAT'S NOT THE WAY OUR BRAINS AND BODIES EVOLVED ARE BRINGSONBODIES EVOLVED FOR THESE RECEPTORS TO MAKE USE OF CHEMICALS THAT EXIST WITHIN US CALLED IN AGAIN INDOGENOUS CHEMICALS AND THOSE INDOGENOUS CHEMICALS LEAD TO CERTAIN EFFECTS AS I MENTION BEFORE THE KY THING HERE IF YOU HAVEN'T UNDERSTOOD ANYTHING OUTSET UP UNTIL NOW PLEASE UNDERSTAND THIS THE KEY THING IS THAT T H C AND C B D AND THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF CANABUS BIND TO THOSE RECEPTORS THOSE INDOGENOUS CANABINOID RECEPTORS THE ONES THAT WE NATURALLY MAKE WITH MUCH GREATER AFFINITY AND EXERT A VASTLY GREATER POTENCY AND EFFECT ON MOOD AND PECEPTION ET CETERA THENDO OUR INDOGENOUS CANABINOIDS ANOTHER ANALOGY THAT ONE COULD TAKE AN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THIS WOULD BE FORMONTS LIKE TESTOSTERON AND ESTROGEN MANY PEOPLE I WOULD SAY ALL PEOPLE MAKE TESTOSTERON AND ESTROGEN TO VARYING DEGREES SCONDE DEPEN ON WETHER OT YOUR MALE FEMALE YOUR AGE WHAS OT GONE THROUGH PURITY ET CETER ET CETERA BUT LET JUS TAKE TESTOSTERON FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS TESTOSTERONE CIRCULATING IN YOUR BODY THAT'S TRUE IF YOUR MALE OR FEMALE AND THERE ARE RECEPTORS CALLED ANDROGEN RECEPTORS WE COULD EVEN CALL THEM TESTOSTERON RECEPTORS AND THE TESTOSTEROM BINDS TO THOSE RECEPTORS AND HAS EFFECTS ON CELVS IT CAUSES PERGROTH CHANGES THE VOIS IT CAN EFFECT LEBIDO IT FECTS ALL SORTS OF THINGS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY DEPENDING ON WHICH ORGAN AN TISSUE YOUR TALKING ABOUT BUT OF COURSE THEREARE PEOPLE THAT TAKE SYNTHETIC TESTOSTERON OR DERIVITIVES OF TESTOSTERON AND SOME OF THOSE DERIVITIVES FOR INSTANCE IN THE BODY BUILDING COMMUNITY IN THE SPORTS COMMEE THEY WILL TAKE THINGS LIKE DIANABAL THESE ARE MONIFID VERGIONS OF OF TESTOSTERONE THAT CAN BIND TO THE TESTSTERNE RECEPTER WITH MUCH GREATER AFFINITY WHERE I SHOUD SAY THE ANDROGENIS RECEPTOR WITH MUCH GREATER AFFINITY AND HAVE SUPERPHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS EFFECTS THAT WOULD ESSENTIALY NEVER BE SEEN FROM TESTOSTERONE THAT WAS INDOGENALLY IDOGENOUSLY EXCUSE ME IN DOGENOUSLY RELEASE WITHIN THE BODY WE COULD SAY THE SAMETHING FOR ESTROGEN THEIRE ESTROGEN RECEPTERS THEY BIND ESTROGEN OKE BUT IF SOME ONE WERE TO TAKE CYNTHETIC ESTROGEN OR TO INGEST A PLANT COMPOUND THAT CONTAINS VARIOUS ESTEROGENIC COMPOUNDS IN THOSE PLANTS CERTAINLY EXIST OUT THERE THEY CAN HAVE SUPERPHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS ON THOSE RECEPTORS WHY AM I TELLING YOU THIS WELL MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE CANABUS MAROWANA IS A PLANT AND PLANTS GROW OUT OF THE GROUND AND THEIR NATURALLY OCCURRING AND BECAUSE WE HAVE RECEPTERS IN OUR BODY THAT ARE THERE WITHOUT THE NEED TO ENGINEER OR THEM FROM SOME EXTERNAL SORS RIGHT THEIRE IN OUR GENOMIT PROGRAM FOR IT AND WERE BORN WITH THESE THINGS HND WE KEEP THESE CON ARE ENTIRE LIFE MANY PEOPLE MISTAKENLY THINK AH YOU KNOW THESE PLANT COMPOUNDS ARE SAFER FOR US ARE BETTER FOR US OR ARE SOMEHOW APPROPRIATE FOR US TO INGEST BUT THAT SIMPLY NOT TRUE AND HERE IAM NOT SAYING THAT CANABUS IS ALWAYS A BAD IDEA FOR PEOPLE THERE ARE CERTAIN POPULATIONS AN CERTAIN PEOPLE FOR WHICH IT CAN BE RELATIVELY SAFE RECREATIONALLY THAT'S THE TRUTH AND THERE AROTHER POPULATIONS FOR WHICH IT CAN BE DOWNRIGHT DANGEROUS RECREATIONALLY ORMADICINALLY AND OF COURSE THERE ARE MEDICINAL PURPOSES THAT ARE BEING EXPLOREDING WILL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT BUT THIS IS VITAL TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I THINK THAT WHEN WE HEARE OH ITS FROM A PLANT ITS NATURAL AND THEN YOU 'LL SUVE RECEPTER FOR THESE IND DOGENOUS CANABINOID RECEPTORS AND THEREFORE THE MARRIAGE OF THOSE TOO THE COMING TOGETH ERE OF THE CHEMICAL T H C OR SBD OR BOTH WITH THESE RECEPTORS IS SOMEHOW SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN AS IF THIS WAS A A PURPOS OF HAVING THESE RECEPTORS BUT IT'S SIMPLY NOT THE CASE IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE NICOTENIC RECEPTORS ARE NOT THERE BECAUSE NICOTIN IS GOOD FOR US THEY'RE THERE BECAUSE THEI ARE COMPOUNDS THAT EXIST WITHIN US THATER GOOD TO BIND TO THOSE RECEPTORS FROM TIME TO TIME NOW HERE'S THE KEY THING ABOUT I GUES TO DAM SING THEIR LOTICKY THINGS BUT HERE'S A NOTHER KEY THING ABOUT UNDERSTANDING CANABUS IN THE WAY THAT IT WORKS WHICH IS THAT T H C AND C BD WHEN THEY'RE BROUGHT INTO THE BRAIN AND BODY BY SMOKING OR YOU KNOW WHAT EDIBLE ET CETERA THEY BIND TO THOSE RECEPTORS THOSE INDOGENOS CANABINOID RECEPTORS AND THEY TAP INTO THE SAME SYSTEMS THAT YOUR INDOGENIS CANABINOISE WOULD TAPPEN TO THE ONES THAT AFFECT MOOD AND ENERGY IN CREATIVITY IND RELAXATION ET CETERA BUT THEY DO SO WITH THOUSANDFOLD GREATER POTENCY AND AS A CONSEQUENTS OF THAT YOURE INDOGENS CANABINOISS ARE OUT COMPETED THEY REALLY GET NO OPPORTUNITY TO INTERRACT WITH THOSE RECEPTORS AND UNDERSTANDING THAT CAN LEAD TO A VERY CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHY FOR INSTANCE WHEN PEOPLE USE CANABUSTS TO RELIEVE ANXIETY OR THEY USE CANABUS TO ENTER A CERTAIN BRAIN STATE FOR CREATIVITY OR TO ENTER SLEEP WHY A DEPENDENTS ON CANABUSTS STARTS TO EMERGE BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T IN JEST CANABUSTS AND AGAIN IN JEST COULD MEAN SMOKE TO BRING T H C IN OR SBDAN OR INJUST OARLY OR EVEN TRANSFERMAL OR TINCTURE R ONE OF THE OTHER VARIETIES IF THEY DON'T DO THAT THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS NOT ONLY ARE THE RECEPTORS NOT STIMULATED TO THE SAME DEGREE OR WITH THE SAME POTENC THAT THEY NORMALLY ARE BUT THE INDOGENIUS CANABINOIS CAN NO LONGER HAVE THEIR EFFECT SO PEOPLE EXPERIENCE HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF ANXIETY DISERRUPTED MOOD DESRUPTED BRAIN STATE AND SO ON AGAIN I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT I'M NOT TRYING TO PAIN TO PICTURE OF CANABUSTS AS ALL BAD OR EVEN PARTIALLY BAD WHAT I WANT TO DO TO DAY IS GIVE YOU AS MUCH INFORMATION I CAN AS TO HOW CANABUS WORKS HOW ITS DIFFERENT COMPONENT PARTS WORK HOW THEDIFFERENT TYPES OF CANABUS WORK AND POINT TO SOME OF THE VALID MEDICINAL USES AND SOME OF THE RECREATIONAL USES AND THEN LAY OUT THE LANDSCAPE FOR YOU AS TO WHO IS REALLY MOST AT RISK IN TERMS OF PSYCHOACTIVE COMPONENTS AMUNE COMPONENTS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE THE MOST INFORM CHOICE FOR YOU I AM NOT HERE TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO OR WHAT NOT TO DO AS I LIKE TO SAY YOU KNOW DO AS YOU WISH RIGHT I MEAN DON'T DO AS YOU WISH OF ARMS OTHER PEOPLE YOURSELF BUT DO AS YOU WISH BUT NOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING SO THAT'S REALLY MY GOAL HERE SO AS WE BEGIN TO DIVE FURTHER INTO THE BIOLOGY I THINK YOU'L STARE TO GET A CLEARER PICTURE OF WHY CANABUS IS SO EFFECTIVE IN SOME CONTECTS BUT ALSO WHY CAN CREATE SUCH MASSIVE SUFFERING IN OTHER CONTECTS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT OUTCOMPETES YOUR OWN NATURAL IN DOGENIUS CANABINOID SYSTEMS SO THTS TALK ABOUT THOSE INDOGENIS CANABENOID SYSTEMS WHAT THEY ARE AND HOW THEY WORK BECAUSE THAT WILL GIVE US TA LENDS INTO WHAT THE HIGHER POTENC FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT OF THE VARIOUS CANIVIS PLANT VARIETIES AND STRAINS AN T  C AND CBEDY AND SO FORTH HOW AND WHY THOSE WORK I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GRENS NOW CALLED A G ONE IS A VITEMIN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEENS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE SO M DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE POD CAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLTIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS BE THE PROBIATICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GOT IS VERY IMPORTANT ITS POPULATED BY GUP MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WIT THE BRAIN THE MUN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIATICS ANATHLETIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLETIC GREENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTEGINS VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTE GRIGHT IF YOU LIKE TO TRIATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD AN THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TWO AGAIND THAT ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CAM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMIND THRE K TO SO WHAT ARE THE INDOGENOUS CANABENOIDS THESE CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES THAT EVERYBODY MAKES YOU MAKE THEM I MAKE THEM YOU'VE BEEN MAKING THEM BASICALLYS FROM THE TIMETHAT YOU ARE CONCEIVED AND YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE THEM UNTIL THE TIME THAT YOU DIE WHETHER R NOT THEY HAVE THE IMPACT AND THE BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS THAT I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE WE'LL DEPEND A LOT ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE USING YOUR OWN INDOGENOUS CANABINOIDS TO PARKIN THOSE RECEPTORS THAT YOU ALSO HAVE FROM BIRTH UNTIL DEATH OR WHEATHER OR NOT YOU ARE TICKLING THOSE RECEPTERS OR STRONGLY ACTIVATING THOSE RECEPTORS USING SOME EXTERNAL SOURCE LIKE CANAVIS T H C ET CETERA THE TWO MAN INDOGENOS CANABENOIDS THAT WE WANT TO CONSIDER ARE ANANDEMIDE WHICH WE REFER TO AS E A E SO AN ANDEMIDE AND ANOTHER ONE WHICH IS ARACA DENOIL GLICERAL ARACODENOIL GLICERAL WHICH WE WILL ABBREVIATE TO A G SO LET'S JUST TAKE E A E AND TWO A G LUMP THEM TOGETHER AND TALK ABOUT THE INDOGENIS CANABENOIDS JUST TO MAKE IT SIMPLE BUT IF YOU WANTO DO THE DEEP DIVE ON ANADEMIDE VERSES TO A G PLEASE BE MY GUEST THE INDOGENOS CANABINOIDS AR RELEASED FROM NURONS WHAT ARE NURONS NURONS ARE NERVE CELTHS AND NERVE CELLS SHOULD BE CONCEPTIALIZED LIKE THIS YOU HAVE PRIES ANAPTIC NURONS AND POSTNAPTICG RONS PRECEN APTIC NURONS BHASELY CONTAIN LITTLE VESSIG LS LITTLE BUBBLES FULL OF NEURO TRANSMITTER WHICH ARE CHEMICALS AND WHEN NURONS ARE STIMULATED ELECTRICALLY AND THAT COULD BE FROM A THOUGHT IT COULD BE FROM THE DESIRE TO MOVE IT COULD BE BECAUSE OF A DRUG IT COULD BE BECAUSE YOU 'RE HUNGRY THE RELEVANT NURONS WILL VOMIT OUT OR WILL FUSE AS WE SAY THOSE NERLITTLE PACKETSOS LITLLE BUBBLES OF NERO TRANSMITTER INTO THE GAP BETWEEN THE PREIMPOSONAPNERN WE CAL THAT A SYNAPTIC CLAPT OR THE SCYNAPS SO OLD GAPL SPACE AND THE NERO TRANSMITTER FLOWS ACROSS THAT SCYNAPS AND SOME OF IT WILL PARK IN LITTLE PARKING SPOTS THAT WE CALL RECEPTORS ON THE POSONAPTIC NRON SIDE DEPENDING ON WHICH NOR TRANSMITTER IT IS AND A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS NOT WORTH GOING INTO RIGHT NOW THE PARKING OF THAT CHEMICAL IN THOSE NARRO TRANSMITTERE RECEPTORS WILL EITHER CAUSE THAT NURON ON THE POSONAPTIC SIDE TO ITSELF RELEASE NOR TRANSMITTER ELSEWHERE OR IT WILL QUIET IT DOWN SO ALED EXCITATION IN IN ABITION THAT'S COME NEURO TRANSMISSION IN A NUTSHELL TYOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IT NO BIDEAL IT'S NOT GOING TO PREVENT YOU FROM UNDERSTAING TO HIS DISCUSSION IF YIOU UNDERSTAND EVEN A SMALL FRACTION OF WHAT I'VE JUST SAID THEN IT'S GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO UNDERSTAND NOT JUST TO DAY IS DISCUSSION BUT A LOT OF NERO SCIENCE WITH A LOT MORE NUONTS AND DEPTH OF UNDERSTANDING THE UKEY THING TO KNOW ABOUT THE INDOGENOUS CANABINOIDS IS THET UNLIKE MOST NERO TRANSMITTERS THEY ARE RELEASED FROM THE POSSONAPTIC SIDE SO WHAT HAPPENS IS NERRO TRANSMITTER GOES FROM PRESONAPTIC NERON TO POSONAPTIC NURON BUT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS THE POSONAPTIC NURON ITSELF RELEASE IS A CHEMICAL AND THAT CHEMICAL GOES BACKWARD WHAT WE CALL RETCH OR GREATLY TO THE PRESONAPTIC NURON BINDSA RECEPTORS THERE AND CHANGES THE PROBABILITY THAT THE PRESONAPTIC NURON WILL RELEASE NOR TRANSMITTER PUT SIMPLY INDOGENOUS CANABINOIDS TEND TO DECREASE THE PROBABILITY THAT THE A NURON WILL RELEASE NERO TRANSMITTER THEY ARE A SORT OF A BRAK ON THE SYSTEM THEY ARE A WAY OF SHUTTING DOWN THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN NURONS REGULATING IT NOT TO MAKE IT COMPLETELY QUIET BUT TO ADJUST THE LEVELS WITH A LOT OF NUONS NOW THE OTHER THING THAT THE INDOGENOUS CANABINOIDS DO HE SORT OF A MINE BENDER BECAUSE WHERE TALKING ABOUT CANABUS AND A COMMONLY KNOWN FEATURE OF CANABUS AND MAROONIC CONSUMPTION IS DISRUPTIONS IN SHORT TURM MEMORY AND THERE IS ESSENTIALLY ZERO DEBATE AS TO WHETHER NOT THAT OCCURS AND WELL TALK WHAT THE MECHANISMS SOLO BIT LATER AND YET INDOGENOUS CANABINOIDS THE CHEMICALS THAT YOU NATURALLY RELEASE FROM THESE POSONAPTIC NURONS THAT TRAVEL RECHOR GREATLY BACP TO THE PRESONAPTIC NURN ACTUALLY CAN LEAD TO STRENGTHENING OF CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE PRESONAPTIC NURON AND THE POSONAPTIC NURON THROUGH A PROCESS CALLED LONG TURN POTENTIATION OR EL T P THEY CAN ALSO CAUSE WHAT'S CALL DEPRESSION OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN A PRESONAPTIC UR ON AN OPPOSANAPTIC NURON LONG TERMED DEPRESSION HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DEPRESSION AS THA PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE OR IS A ILLNESS LONG TERPOTENTIATION AND LONG TERMD DEPRESSION SIMPLY REFER TO THE PROBABILITY THAT ONE NURON WILL BE ABLE TO STIMULATE AN ACTIVATE ANOTHER NURON AND AS I JUST TOLD YOU THE NDOGENOUS CANABINOIDS CAN EITHER TURN UP THE DIAL OR TURN DOWN THE DIAL THEY CAN EITHER INCREASE THE PROBABILITY OR DECREASE THE PROBABILITY THAT A GIVEN CONNECTION BETWEEN NURONS WILL FUNCTION MORE OR WILL FUNCTION LESS SO YOU THINK ABOUT THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN NURONS AS CROSS TALK IS A CONVERSATION WELL THE INDOGENOUS CANABINOIDS CAN DICTATE WHETHER NOT THAT CONVERSATION IS LIKELY TO OCCUR OR NOT TO OCCUR THING OF THEM AS EITHER AM YOU KNOW PUTTING SOMEONE AT THE TOP OF YOUR TEXT CHAIN IN YOUR PHONE WHICH WOLD BE LONG TERN POTENTIATION OR ESSENTIALLY BLOCKING THEIR NUMBER WHICH WOULD ESSENTILLY BE LONG TERM DEPRESSION SO IF YOU ARE GETTING THE IMPRESSION THAT THE NDOGENOUS CANABINOIDS ARE WORKING AND A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND ITS NOT VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD YOUR RIGHT IN FACT THAT'S THE MESSAGE THAD LIKELY TO TAKE AWAY THE INDOGENOUS CANABINOIDS ARE SOMETIMES INCREASING NERONAL COMMUNICATION THIS CAN LEAD TO INCREASES IN MOOD OR INCREASES IN THE LIKELIHOOD THAT SOME ONE WILL TALK A CERTAIN WAY OR BEHAVE A CERTAIN WAY OR FEEL A CERTAIN WAY THEY CAN ALSO LEAD TO DECREASES IN SCENAPTIC TRANSMISSION THAT IS COMMUNICATION BETWEEN NURONS IN WAYS THAT WILL MAKE SOMEBODY'S MOOD LOWER OR WILL MAKE THEM LESS HUNGRY OR MORE HUNGRY AND HERE'S THE REALLY KE THING THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF INDOGENOUS CANABINOID RECEPTORS REFER TO A C B ONE AND C B TWO AND WE CAN SAY WITH CONFIDENCE THAT C B ONE IS HIGHLY ENRICHED IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE BRAIN ITS FOUND NOT EVERYWHERE BUT ALMOST EVERYWHERE IN THE BRAIN AND ELSE WHERE IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS O SPINAL CORD AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM C B TWO THE CANABINOID RECEPTER C B TOO IS LARGELY LOCATED AND THE TISSUES OF THE BODY INCLUDING THE MUNE SYSTEM THE LIVER EVEN THE GENITALS ET CETERA SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT THE INDOGENOUS CANABINOIDS ARE HAVING THE SORTS OF EFFECTS ON NURONS THAT I TALKED ABOUT BUT THEY ARE ALSO HAVING EFFECTS ON I MUNE CELLS ON REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS ON LIVER ON DIGESTION ON HUNGER ET CETERA THROUGH MECHANISMS THAT ARE DIVORCED FROM THE FUNCTION OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF NURONS NOW IN REALITY NO SYSTEM OF THE BRAIN ABODY IS DIVORCE FROM THE NERVOUS SYSTEM BECAUSE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS CONTROLLING EVERYTHING HERE IS REALLY THE MASTER CONTROLLER AND EVERYTHING FEEDING BACK TO THE NERVOUS SYSTEM SO IT'S A TO A STREET BUT THE SIMPLE WAY TO THING ABOUT A C B ONE RECEPTERS ARE MAINLY IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND C B TWO RECEPTORS ARE MAINLY IN THE BODY AND INDOGENOUS CANABINOIDS AGAIN E A ANADAMID AND TWO A G ERACA DENOIAL GLICERAL AR IMPACKING C B ONE AND C B TWO RECEPTORS TO DAY WERE MAINLY GOING TO TALK ABOUT C B ONE RECEPTORS CAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES AR RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE FAMILIAR FACTS OF CANABAS BUT THE KE TAKE AWAY AT THIS POINT IS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE MAJOR EFFECTS OF YOUR INDOGENOUS CANABINOIDS ON THESE RECEPTORS IN THE PARTICULAR C B ONE ARE VERY NEW ONTS IT DEPENDS ON CONTECTS DEPENDS ON WHICH NURONS IT'S YOU KNOWL SOMETIMES INCREASING COMMUNICATION BETWEEN EURON SOMETIMES DECREASING IT AND THEN A LONG COMES CANABUS AND THAT CANABAS AGAIN CAN ARRIVE BY SMOKING BY VAPING BY EDIBLE AND CANABAS CONTAINS T H C AND C B D THAT POTENTLY BIND THE C B ONE RECEPTOR AND NOW THE EFFECTS OF THE C B ONE RECEPTOR BEING OCCUPIED BY T H C ARE BEING OCCUPIED BY C B B ARE NOT VERY NEW ONTS IN FACT THEY ARE VERY PREDICTABLE AND ESPECIALLY IMPORTANCE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE SO STRONG AND THEY PARK IN THAT RECEPTOR WITH SUCH AFFINITY WITH SUCH FORCE AND PRECISION AND STUBBORNNESS AND REFUSAL TO LEAVE THAT RECEPTOR THAT THEY COMPLETELY OUTCOMPETE THE INDOGENOUS CANABINOID SYSTEM IN FACT THEY LEAVE THE INDOGENOUS CANABINOID SYSTEM ESSENTIALLY DISFUNCTIONAL WHICH IN SOME CASES MAY BE A GOOD THING BUT IN MOST CASES IS GOING TO LEAD TO PROBLEMS OF VARIOUS KINDS AND WELL TALK ABOUT WHAT SORTS OF PROBLEMS AND AGAIN I FEEL OBLIGATE TO SAY THIS IS NOT ME SAYING DON'T INGEST CANABUS OR T H C R C B D A IT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING WHAT I'M SAYING IS IF YOU AVALUATE THE POTENC THAT IS IN TECHNICAL TERMS IT WOULD BE THE AFFINIT WITH WHICH THESE COMPOUNDS T H C AND C B D AND C B AN BIND TO THESE INDOGENOUS RECEPTORS THAT WOULD BE LIKE A HOWITS ARE GONE LIKE A CANNON GOING OFF AS COMPARED TO INDOGENOUS CANABINOID WHETHER NOT IT'S YA OR TOO A G WHICH IS MORE LIKE A CAP GUN LEVEL OF ACTIVATION AT LEAST IN THE SANALOGY SO NOW YOU HAVE WHAT AT LEAST I WOULD LIKE TO THINK IS A FAIRLY COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIFFEREN VARIETIES OF CANABAS AT LEAST AT A BROAD SWEEP AND THE DIFFERENT BIOLOGICAL EFFECTSTHAT THEY CAN HAVE AT LEAST IN TERMS OF THE MAJOR RECEPTERS AND RETRIGADES SIGNALING ET CETERA ET CETERA NOW LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK INTO THE REAL WORLD AND VALUWAHT OR THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEBODY SMOKES CANABUS OR IN JST CANABAS BY WAY OF EDIBLE OR TINCTURE SOMETHING THAT SORT CANABAS IS VERY FAST TO ENTER THE BLOOD STREAM IN FACT WITHIN THIRTY SECONDS IT'S GOING TO ENTER THE BRAIN AND PERMEATE THROUGHOUT THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT'S VERY VERY FAST AND  CONTRASTS THAT WITH SOMETHING LIKE AUCOAUL OR EVEN NIKATIN DEPENDING HOW THE NIKETINE IS DELIVERED THAT IS VERY FAST DELIVERY OF THE PSYCHOACTIVE AND BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE COMPOUND WHICH IN THIS CASE IS T  C AND C B D AND PROBLY SOME OTHER THINGS AS WELL SO WITHIN THIRTY SECONDS IT REACHES THE BRAIN AND BODILY TISSUES AND WITHIN THIRTY TO SIXTY MINUTES IT'S GOING TO REACH ITS P CONSIN TRATIONS AND HAVE ITS PEAK BIOLOGICAL EFFACTS THOSE AREN'T ALWAYS THE SAME THING BUT IN THE CASE OF CANABAS AGAIN HERE O MUSING CANBAS AS A KIND OF UMBRELLA TERM FOR T H C ND C B D THE EFFECTS ARE GOING TO PIKE AT ABOUT THIRTY TO SIXTY MINUTES AFTER BRINGING THOSE COMPOUNDS INTO THE BODY IN SOMEWHERE ANDOTHER AND THE EFFECTS TEN TO LAST ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO FOUR HOURS ALTHOUGH THERE'S SOME VARIATION ON THAT DEPENDING ON INDIVIDUAL METABOLISM WHETHER NOT SOMEBODY IS I FAMILIAR WITH THE COMPOUND BELIV ITARE NOT PSYCHOLOGICALLY FAMILIAR BUT ALSO BIOLOGICALLY FAMILIAR OR WHETHER NOTS A FIRST TIME USE OR OCCASIONAL USE AND SO ON T H C AND C B D AND OTHER COMPONENTS OF CANABAS ARE HIGHLY WHAT WE CALL LIPOPELIC THAT IS THEY HAVE AN AFFINITY TOWARD AND THE CONNACTIALLY PASS THROUGH FATTY TISSUES NOW EVERY CELL IN YOUR BODY BUT ESPECIALLY NURONS HAVE A DOUBLE LAYER OF FAT ON THEIR OUTSIDE AND OF COURSE WHEN PEOPLE SAY HERE FAT THEY WY THIN OU FATS BAD FADEVER YOU KNOW MOST OF THE WORLD SEEMS TO WANT TO LOSE FAT OR BODILY FAT HERE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE FATTY MEMBRANE THE BARRIER ROUND EACH TISSUE IN THIS CASE WE'RE TALKING PARTICULARLY ABOUT NURONS AND T H C AND C B D AND THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF CANABAS ARE HIGHLY LIPOPELIC SO THEY CAN GET INTO ESSENTIALLY ALL CELLS JUST  BY FLOWING INTO THEM THEY WIL ALSO REMAIN IN THOSE CELLS FOR A LONG TIME SO I KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE PANNION WHETHER R NOT THEY GET TESTED FOR WORK OR FOR SPORT OR OTHERWISE FOR CANABAS OR C B D AND T H C DON'T TAKE THIS AS A STRICT NUMBER BUT TIPICALLY IF ONE IN JS C B D OR T H C SMOKES CANABAS AND JESTS BY ORALY ET CETERA DOESN'T MATTER IT'S GOING TO STAY IN THAT FATTY TISSUE AND CAN BE DETECTED FOR AT LEAST AS LONG AS EIGHTY DAYS AFTER INGESTION AND THERE'S A WHOLE INDUSTRY AS TO YOU KNOW HOW TO CELERATE THE CLEARANCE AND A I SHOULD JUST TELL YOU THAT JUST LOSING BODILY FAT ISN'T GOING TO A ELIMINATE IT FROM YOUR SYSTEM I MAY BE PARTIALLY IN THOSE FAT CELLS BUT I  CERTAINLY ININ TROVISERAL FAT AND OTHER FATTY TISSUE THAT'S IN AROUND THE BRAIN EMBODY IS GOING TO HARBOR THAT NO T H C MOLECULE IN THE C B D MOLECULE FOR QUITE A LONG WHILE AT LEAST EIGHT DAYS GSO YIF SOME ONE SMOKES CANABAS OR THEY IN JUST CANABAS VERY RAPIDLY GETS INTO THE BLOODSTREAM AND THE COMPONENTS THAT ARE PSYCHOACT OF GETTIN TOTHE BLOODSTREAM AND ARE IMMEDIATELY ABLE TO ACCESS NURONS AND OTHER CELLS AND START HAVING THESE EFFECTS OF PARKING AT THOSE INDOGENISTS CANNABONOIND RECEPTORS AND IMPACTING THE SIGNALLING BETWEEN NURONS WHICH LEADS TO THE SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS OF CANABAS INCLUDING T H C AND C B D SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WITH THOSE DIFFERENT SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS ARE AGAIN THIS IS GOING TO VERY DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT PEOPLE ARE JESTING CETIVA VARIETIES OF CANABASTS JUST REMIND YOU THAS THEN BE ELEVATED MOOD ALERTNESS TALKATIVENESS PEOPLE WHO TAKES THE TEVE OF VARIETIES TEND TO TALK A LOT MORE THAN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE AGAIND THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THIS OF COURSE THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS I'M SURE THEIR PEOPLE OUT THEYRE SHOUTING ALTHOU I GESSIF YOUR THE QUIET PEOPLE WHO DON'T TALK TO MUCH YOURE PROBABLY NOT SHOUTING OR YOURE NOT YOURE NOT DOING ON CETIVA JOKE CINTENDED BUT IN ANY EVENT THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS BUT THERE ARE ALSO GENERAL RULES AND THE CETIVAS TEND TO ME PEOPLES ORE MOOD ELEVATED ENERGETIC GAND THE OR HEAD HIGH AND INDICA VARIETIES TEND TO DO THE OPPOSITE MORE OF A SEDATIVE RELAXENT ET CETERA WHY AND HOW WOULD THEY DO THAT OOK HEY WITHOUT GOING IN TO AN EXTENSIVE DEEP DIVE INTO THE DIFFEREN NARRO TRANSMENTER SYSTEMS OF THE BRAIN AND BODY WHAT WE KNOW FOR SORE IS THAT S B ONE RECEPTORS ARE PRESENT ON AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF DIFFERENT NURONS IN PRAIN STRUCTURES IN NURAL CIRCUITS SO THAT THE CETIVA VARIETIES THAT ACT A SORT OF A STIMULANT MAKING PEOPLE FEEL HAPPY CAUSE IN GENERAL THEY DO TEND TO ELEVATE MOOD AT LEAST AT CERTAIN DOSAGES TALKATIVE A TEND TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL ON LIKE THEY HAVE IDEAS THAT ARE INTERESTING THAT THEY MIGHT WANT A SHARE OM TEND TO NARROW THEIR CONTEX SOTAND TO INCREASE FOCUS THAS IS SOMETHING IS NOT OFTEN DISCUSSED ABOUT CANABUS BUT IT CAN SPECIALLY THE SETIVA VARIETIES CAN INCREASE PEOPLE'S LEVEL OF FOCUS TO PARTICULAR THINGS ASOMETHING THEIR WATCHING OR SOMETHING THEI'R DOING OR MUSIC ALLOWS THEM TO NARROW THEIR SENSE OF FOCUS THAT'S GOING TO OCCUR BY ACTIVATION OF S B ONE RECEPTORS IN THE SO CALL PREFRONTAL QUARTEX WHICH IS JUST BEHIND THE FOREHEAD AND THE PREFONTAL QUARTEC ACTS AS A STRONG MOGULATOR OF SO CALL LIMBIC CIRCUITRY AND OTHER CIRCUITRY THAT IS MORE STRESS ORIENTED AN THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THE STRESS AND LIMBIC CIRCUITRY SUCH AS THE AMIGDULA WHICH MANY PEOPLE HAVE HEARD ABOUT THAT THEY AREN'T REALLY CIRCUITS FOR FEAR AND STRESS THEY ARE CIRCUITS THAT ARE CONSTANTLY EVALUATING ONE'S OWN INTERNAL STATE HEART RATE ET CETERA AND WHAT'S HAPPENING EXTERNALLY AND SORRY TO SAY BUT THE DEFAULT OF THOSE SYSTEMS IS TO DETECT DANGER THES SOR THREAT DETECTION SYSTEMS AND THEN THE PREFNTAL QUARTEX LARGLY ACTS AS A BREAK ON THOSE SYSTEMS SO VE LIKE THE RAINS PULLING BACK ON A STEED OF HORSES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE JUST CON OF TAKE OFF AND SO THE CETIVA VARIETIES TEND TO INCREASE S B ONE ACTIVATION IN THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX AND ANOTHER CIRCUITRY THAT THEN LEADS TO A KIND OF OVERAUL REDUCTION IN STRESS BECAUSE THE WAY THAT PREFRONTAL CIRCUITRY CAN REDUCE ACTIVATION OF THE EMIGDULA NOW THAT CORSE DOES NOT EXPLAIN WHY SOME PEOPLE BECOME VERY STRESSED AND VERY PARENOID WHEN THEY SMOKE SETIVA VARIETIES OR OTHER VARIETIES OF CANABAS ORE INJEST OTHER VARIETIES OF CANABAS WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE PARONOID EFFECT AND WHY THAT OCCURS IN WHO MIGHT PREDICT THAT WOULD OCCUR TO THEM IN IT IN L BIT BUT THIS ON TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW THIS IS WORKING BECAUS AS I MENTION BEFORE T C AND OR CB DY ARE GOING TO BIND THAT S B ONE RECEPTOR LET SAY IN PREFRONTAL QUARTEXS AND NURONS OF PREFRONTAL QUARTES GEN A BIND THERE AND THEN THEYEWILL BE A RETREGATE SIGNALLING BACK TO THE PRESNAPPTIC NURON IN THE CASE OF PREFRONTAL QUARTEX WHAT'S HAPPENING IS ITS INCREASING TRANSMISSION INCREASING THE RELEASE OF NARO TRANSMITTER IN PREFRONTAL QARTEX HOWEVER AT THE SAME TIME THE VERY SAME T  C AND C BD THAT WAS BROUGHT INTO THE SYSTEM IS BINDING THE VERY SAME TYPE OF RECEPTORS SIBE ONE RECEPTORS IN OTHER BRAIN STRUCTURES SUCH AS THE EMIGDULA AND CAUSING RETROGRATE SIGNALING BACK TO THE PRECENT APTIC URONS IN THE MIDULA BUT ITS QUIETING THE ACTIVATION OF THOSE NAURONS SO THIS IS INTERESTING RIGHT WE HAVE THE SAME COMPOUNDS TICY AND ORSIBD BROUGHT INTO THE BODY AND BRAIN BINDING THE SAME RECEPTORS IN THIS CASE THE SIBE ONE RECEPTORS BUT DEPENDING ON WHERE THOSE RECEPTORS ARE LOCATED AND WHICH BRAIN AREAS WERE REFERRING TO THEY ARE EITHER CAUSING HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF ALERTNESS AND ACTIVATION OF SYSTEMS THAT ARE DESIGN TO MAKE YOU TALKATIVE AND ALERTNESS AND MOOD ET CETERA FOCUS OR THEY ARE CAUSING SUPPRESSION OF THOSE CIRCUITRIES SO WE HAVE A KIND OF A SE SAW EFFECT HERE WHERE THE SAME COMPOUND IS INCREASING MOOD AND ALERTNESS AND FOCUS IN THE PREFRONTAL QUARTICS AND IS DECREASING STRESS AND THREAT DETECTION IN THE EMIGDULA AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY ESPECIALLY THE SATIVA VARIETIES OF CANAVAS ALLOW PEOPLE TO ENTER THESE STATES OF FOCUS SO MIGHT EVEN SAY FLOW ALTHOUGH I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO WHAT FLOW STATES REALLY ARE THAT'S FOR A DIFFERENT DESCUCTION AND ITS VERY POORLY DEFINED AS IT IS ND I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE THE IMPRESSION THAT CANABAS INCREASES FLOW STATES BECAUSE THATS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE AND CERTAINLY MOST OFTEN AS NOCKEN TO BE THE CASE BUT THE IDEA HERE IS THAT THIS MOLECULE COMES INTO OUR BRAIN AND IS SHIFTING EVERYTHING TOWARDS A STATE OF FOCUS ELEVATED MOOD OF HEIGHTENED SENSE OF IMPORTANCE ABOUT WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE HAPPEN TO BE DOING AND NOW OF COURSE WHATEVER WE COULD HAPPEN TO BE DOING COULD BE WRITING A SONG WRITING POETRY COMMUNICATING WITH SOMEBODY BUT IT COULD ALSO BE SOMETHING AS TRIVIAL AS WATCHING CARTOONS OR WATCHING A MOOVI WHICH IS IN OUGHT NOT TRIVIAL IN ITS OWN RIGHT BUT IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT THE CREATIVE ASPECTS OR THE CREATED TIVITY STIMULATING ASPECTS OF CANAVAS NOT A TSOOF PRODUCTIVITY ORIENTED SO NARROWED FOCUS ELEVATED MOOD MORE RELAXED AND YET ENERGETIC THAT'S THE MAJOR EFFECTS OF THE SATIVA VARIETIES EXCEPT AND THIS IS A REALLY BIG BOLD FACED TRIPLE UNDER LINE EXCEPT EXCEPT IN SOME INDIVIDUALS DEPENDING ON DOSAGE BUT ALSO DEPENDING ON PREEXISTING NERL CIRCUITRY AND PROPENSITY FOR ANXIETY SOME PEOPLE IN JEST OR SMOKE SETIVA VARIETIES AND REGARDLESS OF WEATHER NODS A TYPE ONE TYPE TO OR TYPE THREE VARIETY  CAN REGARDLESS OF THE RATIO BETWEEN T SI AND SIBD PEOPLE WILL EXPERIENCE INTENSE ANXIETY IN PARENOIA HIDO YOU PREDICT WHO WILL EXPERIENCE INTENSE ANXIETY IN PARENOISA AND WHO WILL EXPERIENCE INTENSE RELAXATION FOCUS AND SENSE OF CREATIVITY FROM INJESTING OR SMOKING A TYPE ONE TYPE TO OR TYPE THREE SETIVA WELL THERE IS NO WAY TO PREDICT THAT AND THERE'S A LOT OF KIND OF WHAT I WERE CALL STREET LORE OR DORMRUM LORE OR CAN OF A PURE NOT PURE REVIEWED A BUT A SORT OF PURE DISGUST MEAN AMONG FRIENDS AND PEOPLE AND ACQUAINTANCES LORE OUT THERE THAT WHAT ONE NEEDS TO DO IS SIMPLY SMOKE MORE RIGHT OR JUST IN GJEST MORE YOU HEAR THAT OH A LISTON IF IT MAKES YOU PARONOID YOU SIMPLY NEEN TO USE MORE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CATEGORICALLY FALSE EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT THE WAY THAT T H C AND C BD WORK IS THAT THEY TEND TO POTENTIATE THAT IS INCREASE THE EFFECTS OF THESE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS AT GIVEN SYNAPSISM IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT IS IF SOME ONE EXPERIENCES PARONOIS OR ANXIETY FROM A GIVEN STRAIN OF THE MAROWANA PLANT OR FROM INJESTING AN EDIBLE IN A PARTICULAR WAY OR PARTICULAR KIND OF EDIBAL THAT PERSON IS VERY LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE THE SAME EFFECT EVERY TIME THEY INJEST THAT STRAIN OR VARIETY THIS IS PART OF WHAT'S LED TO THIS ENORMOUS INDUSTRY IN THEIR NUMBER DIFFEREN REASONS BUT THIS PART OF WHAT'S LED TO THIS ENORMOUS INDUSTRY OF HIGHLY CUSTOMIZE CANIBUS WHERE PEOPLE WILL SPEND SOME TIME REALLY SEEKING OUT THE DIFFERENT STRAINS OF CANIBAS AND HI HIBRIDS OF CANBUS THAT WORK BEST FOR THEM AND WORK BEST FOR THEM IN PARTICULAR CONTECTS I WISH I COULD TELL YOU THAT IF YOU ARE A PERSON WHO IS YOU KNOW BETWEEN FIVE FOOT SEVEN AND A SIX FEET TALL AND A YOUR BLUE EYES A WERE BROWN EYES THAT THI SATIVA VARIETIES ARE GOIGTO BE RIGHT FOR YOU OR THAT THE SUTVA VARIETIES ARE GOINGTO TO YOU PANIC ATTECTS I CAN'T DO THET THE ONLY WAY TO DETERMIN IT WOULD BE TO ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE INJESTING THOSE ARE SMOKING THOSE WHICH IS CERTAINLY ALSO NOT WHAT I AM SUGGESTING RIGHT THAT'S UP TO YOU I'M NOT TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO OR WHAT NOT TO DO BUT THERE ARE NO GOOD PREDICTORS IN FACT IF YOU LOOK IN THE LITERATURE IT IS NOT AT ALL CLEAR THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE A HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF ANXIETY WHEN THEY DO NOT SMOKE CANIBUS WILL EXPERIENCE CANIBUS AS LESS PARONOISAIN DU SING OR MORE RELAXING THAT'S SIMPLY NOT THE CASES NOW WHAT WE CAN SAY FOR SURE IS THAT A GENERAL CATEGORIES OF EFFECTS SUCH AS INCREASE FOCUS AND REDUCED ANXIETY ARE LARGELY DUE TO ACTIVATION OF AREAS LIKE THE PREFRONTAL QUARTECTS NOW UNLIKE OTHER COMPOUNDS LIKE NICATINE OR ALCOHOLL OR NERA TRANSMITER SYSMS LIKE DOPAMINE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE CANABONOID SYSTEM AND I SAY EFFECTS BIOLOGICAL EFFECT PSYCHOACT OF EFFECTS I WANT YOU TO KEEP IN MIND ALWAYS PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT THOSE EFFECTS CAN BE VARIED AND OFTEN OPPOSITE IN DIRECTION SO THIT'S JUST GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF THAT I JUST MENTION THAT WHEN PEOPLE SMOKE OR OR EAT SATIVA THAT IT TENDS TO LEAD TO ONE SPECIFIC SET OF OR GENERALLY LEADS TO ONE SPECIFIC SET OF FFECTS HEIGHTENFOCUS MOOD ET CETERA WHEREAS WHEN THEY INGEST OR SMOKE INDICA AND ITS COMPONENTS RIGHT AGAIN WERE STILL TALKING ABOUT T H  AND C B D AND VARYING RATIOS BUT NOW INDICA CANIBUS AND SAY WHAT WHY WOULD IT IMPROVE THE TRANSITION TIME TO SLEEP OR AT LEAST GIVE PEOPLE THE IMPRESSION THAT IT IMPROVE THE TRANSITION IN TO SLEEP WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT INDICA ACTUALLY DOES FOR SLEEP IN A L BIT BUT INDICA ALSO TENDS TO SUPPRESS ACTIVATION OF THE EMIGDALA AND THREATEN DETECTION CENTORS IN THE BRAIN AGAIN BINDING THE SAME C B ONE RECEPTORS IN THOSE RETROGADE SIGNALLING MECHANISMS HAVE TALKED ABOUT BEFOR BUT IT ALSO TENDS TO SHUT DOWN THE HIPPOCAMPUS AN AREA OF THE BRAIN ASSOCIATED WITH MEMORY WHICH IS WHY INDICA VARIETIES LEAD TO PRONOUNCED OR I SHOULD SAY PROFOUND DEFECTS IN SHORT TER MEMORY AND SOMETIMES IN LONG TER MEMORY AS WELL IF ITS CONSUMED OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME WILL TALK ABOUT SHORT MEDIUM AND LONG TERM CONSUMPTION OCCASIONAL CONSUMPTION GOING FORWARD SO WHAT I LIKELYU TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS COMPONE OF THE DISCUSSION IS FIRST OF ALL THE MECHANISM OF ACTION BY WHICH CANABAS IMPACTS THE BRAIN AND BODY BUT IN PARTICULAR THE BRAIN IS GOING TO BE THROUGH C B ONE RECEPTORS AND THE C B ONE RECEPTORS CAN LEAD TO EITHER AN ACCELERATION OR A BREAK ON PARTICULAR BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS AND THERE ARE GOING TO BE A CONSTELLATION OF DIFFERENT ECCELERATIONS AND BREAKING OF DIFFERENT NERAL SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY DEPENDING ON WHEATHER OR NOT PEOPLE IN GJUSCITIVA OR INDICA OR SOME HIBRAD STRAIN AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING I AVE SAID ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF THESE DIFFERENT STRAINS IN THE RECEPTORS PLEASE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS NO WAY TO PERDICT WHAT THE EFFECT OF A GIVEN STRAIN WILL BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL THERE HAS BEEN EXTENSIVE EXPLORATION AS TO WHETHER NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE SO CALL MELOWER OR MORE ANXIOUS OR ANY  NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PERSONALITY DIMENSIONS WILL RESPOND IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BUT IN FACT THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL LAY ER ON TOP OF THAT THE FACT THAT DOSING T H C AN C B D CAN BE FAIRLY STRAIGHT FORWARD IN THE FORM OF ETIBLES MIHT BECAUSE THERE CAN THERE CAN BE AT LEAST OF ITS A CONTROLLED SOURCE A DEFINED NUMBER OF MILIGRAMS OF T H C A TO FIND NUMBER OF MILIGRAMS OF C B D THAT'S TRUE FOR INJESTABLES IT'S MUCH HARDER TO GAH THAT FROM THE SMOKABLE FORMS OF CANABAS ESPECIALYIF THOSE SMOKABLE FORMS OF CANABAS ARE OBTAIN THROUGH SOURCES WHERE THERE ISN'T A LOT OF CLEAR INFORMATION ABOUT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF T H C IN THAT PRODUCT AT THIS IS ALL CHANGING QUITE A LOT NOWADAYS BECAUSE OF THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF T H C AND C B D PRODUCTS IN CANABAS IN A NUMBER DIFFERNAREAS CLUDING IN THE UNITED STATES BUT STILL MANY PEOPLE ARE INJESTING CANABAS T H C C B D THROUGH SOURCES WHERE THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW MUCH THEIR BRINGING INTO THEIRESYSTEM AND SO WHETHER OR NOT SOME ONE GETS INCREDIBLE ANXIETY RELIEF IN HANCE SENSE OF MOOD AND FOCUS AND WELL BEING PAIN RELIEF ET CETERA OR WHETHER NOT THEY AVE FULBLE AN PANIC ATTACKS ET CETERA IS VERY HARD TO PERDICT BASED ON DOSAGE INFORMATION ALONE NOW OF COURSE WE CAN CREATE BROAD CATEGORIES AND WE ARE GOIN TO TALK ABOUT STUDIES THAT CREATE BROAD CATEGORIES OF LO DOSE MODERATE DOES AND HIDOS FREQUENT USE AND INFREQUENT USE BUT UNLIKE ALCOHOLL UNLIKE NIKE EN WE CAN'T REALLY POINT TO SPECIPHICITY OF EXAMOUNT OF ALCOHOL GRAMS OF ALCOL PER WEAK WHICH IS SAY FOR EXAMOUNT OF ALCOLL WHICH IS NOT SAFE AND SO I KNOW LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE WONDERING NOW HOW OFTEN CAND THEY SMOKE CANABUS ARE HOOFTEN CAN THEY EAT CANABUS OR T H C R C B D IN ANY NUMBER OF ITS DIFFERENT FORMS IN PRODUCTS SAFELY WELL WE HAVE TO REALLY TEFIND WHAT SAFELY MEANS AND WE HAVE TO REALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S A PRETTY LOOSE SET OF CONTROLS OVER WHAT ONE IS BRINGING INTO THE BRAIN AN BODY AS THEY IN JUST T  C AND  B D BUT EVEN UNDER CONDITIONS IN WHICH ITS VERY CONTROL IT'S VERY HARD TO PREDICT WHAT THOSE EFFECTS WILL BE SO BEFORE MOVING INTO SPECIFICS OF TAKING CANABUS ARE NOT TAKING CANABAS WHO SHOULD WHO SHOULD WHAT THE MEDICINAL PURPOSES ARE AN WHAT SOME OF THE NEWER EXCITING DATA POINT TO I JUST BRIEFLY WON TO MAKE A LISTIN I PROMISE VERY BRIEFLY I KNOW I'M NOT OFTEN CONCISE BUT I DO TRY TO BE THOROUGH FOR YOUR SAKE I WANT TO MAKE A VERY BRIEF LIST OF THE DIFFERENT BRAIN AREAS THAT AR IMPACTED BY T  C ND C B D AND WHY T C AND C B  HAVE THE VARIOUS EFFECTS THEY DO WHEN SOMEBODY SMOKES OR IN JEST CANABUS DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE T H C ER C B D RATIO IS IF THEY EXPERIENCE DEFASITS IN MEMORY AND THAT'S ALMOST ALWAYS PRESENT THAT'S GOING TO BE BECAUSE OF REDUCTIONS IN ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY WITHIN THIS BRAIN REGION WE CALL THE HIPPOCAMPUS  HEPIGA MUS MEANS C ORS AT SHA LEES SE ORS AND ATAMAS LIKE TO NAME THINGS AFTER WHAT THINGS LOOK LIKE BUT HIPPOCAMPUS MEMORY MEMORY IS REDUCED IN PARTICULAR SHORT TERM MEMORY THAT'S THROUGEH REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT ONE IS USING SETIVA INTICA OR SOME HYBRID IN GENERAL THE PREFRUNTS AL QUARTEX AS GOING TO BE ACTIVATED BY THE SETIVA VARIETIES WHICH IS GOING TO INCREASE THINKING IN NARROWLY CONSTRAINED FOCUS TO SOME ACTIVITY AND THAT'S MORE COMMONLY ASSOCIAT WITH THE SETIVA VARIETIES THE INTICA VARIETIES AS E MENTION BEFORE TEND TO LEAD TO A SUPPRESSION OF ACTIVITY IN PREFRONTAL QUARTEX BELIEVEIT OR NOT AND CANE TURN OFF THINKING AND PLANNING THIS IS WHY INTICA VARIETIES ARE OFTEN USED FOR RELAXATION AND FOR PROMOTING SLEEP REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT SATIVA OR INDICA VARIETY AND AGAIN REGARDLESS OF THE RATIO OF T  C TO C B D THERE IS A GENERAL SUPPRESSION OF NERL CIRCUITS WITHIN THE SO CALLED BASIL GANGLIA AND SARABELLUM BASL GANGLI AND SAREBELLUM ARE AIRES OF THE BRAIN THAT AR INVOLVED IN ACTION PLANNING AND WITH HOLDING ACTIONS THOU BE THE BASIL GANGLIA SO CALLED GO NO GO CIRCUITRY AND THE SAREBELLUM WHICH IS INVOLVED IN BALANCE BUT ALSO MOTOR PLANNING AND MOTOR SEQUENCING THIS IS WHY PEOPLE WHO SMOKE MAROUANA REGARDLESS OF THE STRAIN WILL TEND TO B LESS PHYSICALLY MOBILE OTHER COMMON EFFECTS ARE REDDENING OF THE EYES DRYNESS OF THE MOUTH THAT SESSHAY CAUSED BY THE SAME GENERAL MECHANISM WHICH IS A REDUCTION IN THE SECRETION OF SALIVA AND OF S OR TEARS AND LUBRICATION THE EYES FROM THE LACRIMAL GLANDS OF THE EYES BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF LARGELY C B TWO BUT ALSO C B ONE RECEPTORS IN THE MOUTH AND ON THE EYES AND THERE TENDS TO BE ESPECIALLY WITH CERTAIN STRAINS OF CANABAS INCREASE IN APPETITE SO CALLED MUNCHS AND THAT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH VERY VERY HI DENSITY OF C B ONE RECEPTORS IN THE HYPOTHALEMAS AND IN PARTICULAR AREAS OF THE HYPOTHALIS LIKE THE ARCUATE NUCLYUS THE HYPOTHALMAS OTHER AIR IS AS WELL OF COURSE THAT HAVE TONS OF C B ONE RECEPTORS BIN T H C AND C B D AN ACTIVATE THE NURONS THAT STRONGLY STIMULATE APPETITE THROUGH TWO MECHANISMS ONE IS A COGNITIVE MECHANISM OF CREATING A PREOCCUPATION WITH FOOD AND ANTICIPATION OF TASTE AS WELL AS THE EXPERIENCE OF TASTE OF THE NARROWING OF FOCUS TO WHAT YOU WANT TO GO EAT I REALLY CRAVE PETZA IT SEEMS TO BE HYG FAT HYCOBO HYDRATE FOODS BUT REALLY CRAVE PTZA AND NARROWING OF FOCUS SO THATYOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE BUT ALSO SIGNALING FROM THE HYPOTHALEMUS TO THE GUT TO NURONS WITHIN THE STOMACH ITSELF THAT REGULATE BLOOD SUGAR SO THERE ARE STRONG EFFECTS ON BLOOD SUGAR OF T H C AN C B D THAT GENERALLY LEAD TO INCREASES AN APPETITE SO TWO PARALLEL MECHANISMS ONE WITHIN THE BRAIN ONE WITHIN THE BODY INCREASING APPETITE YERE SO THERE IS AN ARRAY OF DIFFERENT EFFECTS AND AS I MENTION BEFORE C B ONE RECEPTORS A PRESENT ALL OVER THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IN THE BRAIN THE SPINAL CORD IN FACT THE PRESENCE OF C B ONE RECEPTORS IN THE SPINAL CORD LARGELY EXPLAINS THE FACT THAT T H C AND C B D TO SOME EXTENT ALTHOUGH ITS NOT VERY WELL STUDIED CAN PROVIDE SME PAIN RELIEF I SHALY SAY SOME BECAUSE THE LOT OF PEOPLE PERCEIVE OR BELIEVE THAT THEY EXPERIENCE MORE PAIN RELIEF FROM CANABAS THAN THE ACTUALLY DO ITS ACTIALY HAS THE LOT TO DO WITH A PERCEPTIONAL SHIFT TO BASELY FOCUSING ON OTHER THINGS BUT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOME ANTIGNOSUCEPTIVE MEANING ANTI PAIN EFFECTS OF CANABAS T H C IN PARTICULAR AND THAT IS EXERTED LARGELY THROUGH A FACTS ON C B ONE RECEPTORS IN NURONS OF THE SPINAL CORT SO A BROAD ARRAY OF EFFECTS ARE TAKING PLACE REGARDLESS OF WHAT STRAIN NUTAKE AN WHE THEN I U EAT THE CANABAS ARE YOU SMOKE THE CANABAS AND THE BROAD ARRAY OF EFFECTS CAN BE EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT THAT WRETRORAD SIGNALLING CAN LEAD TO ACTIVATION OR SUPPRESSION OF ACTIVITY IN VARIOUS NURANS SO NOW I LEKE TO TAKE A STEP BACK FROM THE BIOLOGY OF CANABAS AND T H C AND C B D AN ALL THE SIGNALLING AND RECEPTORS ET CETERA AND REALLY JUST FOCUS ON CANABA  USE AND WHEREVER POSSIBLE I WILL POINT TO THE SPECIFIC STRAINS THAT HAVE BEEN STUDIED AND THE RATIOS OF T H C TO C B D BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT UNFORTUNATELY MOST STUDIES OF MARIWANA OF CANABAS W HILE THEY HAVE BEEN VERY CAREFUL TO DETAIL THE AMOUNT OF TE S LODOS MEDIUM DOS OR HYDOS AND ACTALY GTTING VERY SPECIFIC RIGHT DOWN TO NUMBER OF MILIGRAMS OR EVEN HOW MUCH CIRCULATING TOACH H IS PRESENT AFTER SOMEBODY SMOKES A JOINT OR IN JESTS I CANABAS MOST STUDIES HAVE NOT DISTINGUISHED BETWEEN SATIVA AN INDICOF STRAINS THAT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE IN THE REAL WORLD PEOPLE ARE DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN SETIVAN AND INTOCASTRAINS IN THEIR PATTERNS OF USE AND WHAT THEY PREFER IN WHAT THEY DON'T PREFER EVEN WHAT THEY PREFER TO SMOKE DURING THE DAY OR INJESTERING THE DAY VERSES NIGHT BELIEVE R NOT THEIR PEOPLE WHO ARE USING CERTAIN STRAINGS DURING THE DAY AND OTHER STRAINS AT NIGHT BUT THE SCIENCE IS YET TO CATCH UP TO THAT OR I SHOULD SAY MORE ACCURATELY THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND THE THEMES THAT ARE EMERGING AND THE PRACTISES AT THERE EMERGURING AROUND CANABAS ESPECIALLY IN STATES WHERE ITS DECRIMINALIZED OR LEGALIZED ARE OCCURRING AT SUCH A RAPID RATE THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOWAY THAT THE SCIENCE COULD KEEP UP THIS IS A NATURALLY OCCURING EXPERIMENT NOT TO SAY THAT I'S NATURAL LIKE PEOPLE SHOULD DO IT BUT IT'S AND EXPERIMENT THAT'S HAPPENING IN REAL TIME IN THE REAL WORLD MUCH FASTER THAN CAN CONTROLLED STUDIES WITHIN UNIVERS LABORATORIES AND OTHEIR LABORATORIES CAN KEEP UP SO AT THIS POINT I THING IT'S APPROPRIATE TO ASK OURSELVES WHY DO PEOPLE EVEN USE CANABAS MING WHAT ARE THEY TRYING TO ACHIEVE IS IT ALWAYS ABOUT NOT FEELING PAIN IS IT ALWAYS ABOUT REDUCING ANXIETY WELL SOMETIMES IT IS BUT OFTENTIMES PEOPLE ARE USING CANABUS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A PARTICULAR STATE AND WE COULD USE A BROAD RUSH AN SAY WELL THEY JUST LIKE BEING HIGH BUT WHILE THAT MAY BE TRUE IN A LOT OF CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE TO BELIEVE IT ACTUALLY IS TRUE IN A LOT OF CIRCUMSTANCES THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO USE CANABUS IN A VERY DIRECTED WAY OR THEY GET QUOTE IN QHI IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE STATES THAT TO THEM ARE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE AND ONE SUCH STATE IS A STATE OF CREATIVITY AND THIS BRINGS US TO A BROADER THEME WHICH IS DOES CANABAS IN CREASE CREATIVITY AND IF SO IS IT THE T H C THE S B D WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE RATIO OR THE BEST RATIO FOR ACTISING CREATIVITY THIS IS AN INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT DISCUSSION I BELIEVE BECAUSE CREATIVITY IS ONE OF THE MORE SOUGHT AFTER AND MORE ELUSIVE STATES THAT HUMANS CAN EXPERIENCE AND YET IF YOU LOOK AT HUMAN EVOLUTION YOU LOOK AT OUR PROGRESSION A IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND A CULTURE AND A MUSIC AND POETRY ET CETERA WE REALLY CAN LOOK TO CREATIVITY AS THE STATE THAT FOSTERED SO MUCH OF THAT EVOLUTION SO WHETHER NOT YOUR INTO TECHNOLOGY OR INTO ART OR MUSIC WHE THERE NOT YOUR TO SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO EXPAND THEIR UNDER STANDING OR THEIR EXPERIENCE OF LIFE IN SOME WAY CREATIVITY IS A FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT STATE TO TRY AN ACCESS AND TO TRY AN ACCESS REGULARLY AND TO TRY IND TAP INTO IN ORDER TO EVENTUALLY PRODUCE SOMETHING IN ORDER TO CREATE SOMETHING OF MEANING THAT EXISTS NOCTISE IN THAT CREATIVE STATE BUT TO YOURSELF AFTER THAT CREATIVE STATE HAS GONE AWAY RIGTES OF THE PAINTING THAT YOU PAINT IN THE CREATIVE STATE HOPEULY AS A PAINTING THAT STILL INSPIRES AND  HAS IMPACT AFTER YOU EXS AT THAT CREATE OF STATE AND THAT WILL INSPIRE OTHERS AND THIS COULD BE TRUE FOR ANY NUMBER DIFFERENTHINGS NOT JUST PINKING SO DOES CANIBUST INCREASE CREATIVITY THE SHORT ANSWER IS IT DEPENDS FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO DEFINE CREATIVITY  HERE WE ARE AS A THINKING A SCIENTISTS IF NOT ALREADY SCIENTISTS AND THERE ARE BASICALLY TWO MODES OF THINKING THEIR ASSOCIATE WITH CREATIVITY AND THEY DON'T COMPLETELY EXPLAIN CREATIVITY BUT IF YOU LOOK IN THE RESEARCH OF PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCH IND THE NORSCIENCE RESEARCH YOU'LL HEAREABOUT CONVERGEN THINKING AND DIVERGENT THINKING CONVERGEN THINKING IS TAKING LOOS IDEAS AND AN ABRADING THEM TOGETHER FINDING A COMMON THREAD SYNTHESIZING AND ORGANIZING THOSE DIFFERENT IDEAS INTO SOME COMMON OR SPECIFIC FRAMEWORK IN ORDER TO GET OR CREATE SOME SPECIFIC OUTCOME SO CONVERGEN THINKING IS BASICALLY O THE PERSON IN THE ROOM WHOSE LISTENING TO ALL THE IDEAS AND TAKING THEM ALL AND MAY BE IT'S A A PANEL OF YOUNOHOW SHOULD WE OM YOU KNOW HOW SHOULD WE GET A CERTAIN PRODUCT OUT TO MARKET OR YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT MOTIFS THAT WE SHOULD INCLUDE IN A PIECE OF MUSIC OR YOU KNOW OF WHA SHALL WE DO IN TERMS OF RE A REARCHITECTING A GIVEN A PHYSICAL SPACE TAKING IN THOSE DIFFERENT OPINIONS THOSE DIFFERENT IDEAS FROM DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND THEND SYNTHESIZING THEM AND COMING UP WITH ONE OR A SMALL SUBSET OF COHERENT IDEAS THAT INCORPORATE SOME ORE ALL OF THE ONCE THAT THEY HEARD OCASE SO THAT'S CONVERGEN THINKING AT DOESN'T HAVE TO INVOLVE A PANEL OF PEOPLE TALKING TO YOU I USE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT GOES ON INSIDE YOUR OWN HEAD WHEN YOU ARE ENGAGING CONVERGEN THINKING YOU'RE THINKING WELL SO AND SO SAID THIS AND I THINK THAT AND YOUR CONBRATING THEM THROUGH AND TRYING TO GET SOME COMMON THEME SOME COMMON VECTOR TO EMERGE FROM THAT DIVERGEN THINKING ON THE OTHER HAND IS BEST DESCRIBED AS BRAIN STORMING ITS EXPLORING IDEAS AND CONTINUING TO MOVE INTO THE VAREATION IN THE VASTNESS OF IDEAS IN HOPES OF EVENTUALLY BEING ABLE TO CONVERGE ON SOME NOVEL IDEA OF FRAMEWORK SO THESE ARE SIMILAR AND RELATED BUT TYPICALLY THE CREATIVITY PROCESS INVOLVES FIRST BRAIN STORMING AND DIVERGENT THINKING AND THEN IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT SOMETHING TO ACTUALLY CREATE SOMETHING RITE THE VERB CREATE NOT JUST THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT CREATE WHICH ECCRS YURING DIVERGENT THINK ON BIT ACTUALLY CREATING SOMETHING A SPECIFIC PAINTING A SPECIFIC SONG OF SPECIFIC BODY OF LITERATURE A SPECIFIC SCIENTIFIC PROJECT AR EXPERIMENT AND SO ON THAT USUALLY INVOLVES CONVERGENT THINKING NOW THESE CAN BE EXPLORED IN THE LABORATORY AND THEY CAN BE EXPLORED IN THE LABORATORIES THROUGH SETS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF QUESTION AIRS OR EVEN TASKS THAT YOU CAN GIVE HUMAN SUBJECTS AND THIS HAS BEEN DONE EXTENSIVELY AND ACROSS THE ENTIRE BODY OF DATA AND BY THAT I MEAN LITERALY HUNDREDS OF STUDIES THAT HAVE EXPLORED THE RELATIONSHIPD BETWEEN PARTICULAR NORAL CIRCUITS AN OR CHEMICALS CONVERGEN DIVERGENT THINKING WE CAN ARRIVE AT AT A PRINCIPLE AND THE PPRINCIPL INVOLVES A MOLECULE THAT MANY YO'VE HEARD ABOUT BEFORE WHICH IS DOPAMINE DOPAMI IS AN ROMODULATOR IT'S INVOLVED IN MOTIVATION AND IT TENDS TO DIRECT OUR ATTENTION TO THINGS OUTSIDE OF US BUT IT'S ALSO CLOSELY RELATED TO CONVERGEN THINKING IN DIVERGENT THINKING AND TO THE CREATIVE PROCESS AND THEREFORE IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE THAT DISEASES OF THE NERVOUSS NERVOUS SYSTEM SCUSE ME SUCH AS BY POLAR DISORDER OF WHICH WE DONE IN EPISODE ALL ABOUT BY POLAR DISORDER OR SKIS APHRENIA OR MO DISORDERS THAT IMPACT THE LEVELS OF DOPAMINE EITHER MAKING WAYWAY TOO HIGH OR WAYWAY TOO LOW STRONGLY IMPACT WHETHER R NOT PEOPLE WILL BE CREATIVE AND I THINK THE SHORT TAKE AWAY THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE IN TERMS OF FRAMING THIS AND WE COVER THIS ON THE EPISODE ON ON BY POLAR DISORDER SOMETIMES CALLED BY POLAR DEPRESSION IS THAT IN PROFESSIONS WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF CREATIVITY REQUIRED IN ORDER TO SUCCEED SO AGAIN MUSICIANS COMPOSERS ARTISTS ET CETERA YOU TEND TO FIND MORE MANIC DEPRESSION AND MANIC DEPRESSION AT LEAST IN THE MANIC STATES THE HYPERACTIVE STATES ARE CORRELATED WITH ELEVATED LEVELS OF DOPAMI LIKEWISE IT IS BEEN SEEN OVER AND OVER THROUGHOUT HISTORY THAT AN THAT INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE MILD FORMS OF SKIS AFRIENDY OR EVEN FULL BLOWN SKIS OFFRENIA MANY FAMOUS PAINTERS FOR INSTANCE OR MUSICIANS THEY ARE KNOWN TO HAVE ELEVATED LEVELS OF DOPAMINE AND THEY ARE QUITE CREATIVE NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN EVERYBODY WHOSE CREATIVE HAS ELEVATED LEVELS OF DOPAMINE ALTHOUGH IT'S LIKELY THAT THEIR LEVELS OF DOPAMIN ARE AT LEAST NOT DIMINISHED AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT NON CREATIVE PEOPLE HAVE LOW LEVELS OF DOPAMIN SO DON'T GET CARRIED AWAY WITHTHE INTERPRETATION HERE BUT THE POINT IS THIS DOPAMIN LEVELS STRONGLY RELATE TO THE PROBABILITY THAT YOU CAN ENGAGE IN CONVERGENT AND DIVERGENT THINKING AND THEY DO SO IN THE FOLLOWING WAY WHEN DOPAMIN LEVELS ARE HIGH DIVERGENT THINKING IS MORE LIKELY THAT IS WHEN PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF DOPAMEAN CIRCULATING IN THEIR SYSTEM THEY TEND TO BE VERY EXPANSIVE WITH THEIR IDEAS THEY TEND O BRAINSTORM A LOT THEY TEND TO BE COMFORTABLE AND EVEN WANT TO OR REFLECTIVELY THROW OUT A LOT OF IDEAS THAT SOMETIMES EVEN SEEM A LITTLE DISCONNECTED SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK OF THIS IS KIND OF ATTENTION DEFICITE BUT IT'S NOT IT'S REALLY THE IDEA OF YO THROWING OUT DISPIRATE IDEAS IT A YOU KNOW YOU HEAR SOMETIMES YOU KNOW YOU THROW THINGS AGAINST THE WALL AND SEE WHAT STICKS WHILE THESE PEOPLE THAT'S A OBVIOUSLY IT AN ANALOGY BUT PEOPLE ARE A THROWING LOTS OF THINGS AGAINST THE WALL AND SEING WHAT STICK AND THEN SEENG HOW THE THINGS THAT STICK FIT TOGETHER THAT'S DIVERGENT THINKING AND ELEVATIONS IN DOPAMINE TEND TO INCREASE DIVERGENT THINKING HOWEVER THEY TEND TO DO THIS IN KIND OF AN INVERTED YOU SHAPE WAY FOR THOSE EITHER WATCH ON YOU TOO BUM GEST DRAWING KIND OF A A HUMP OBVIOUSLY AND FOR THOSE OF YOU LISTENING JUST IMAGINE A YOU A THE SHAPE A OF A LETTER YOU AND THEY JUST FLIPP IT UPSIDE DOWNS THAT LOOKS LIKE A BULP TURNS OUT THAT WHEN DOPAMIN LEVELS ARE VERY LOW THERE'S A LOW PROBABILITY OF DIVERGENT THINKING WHEN DOPAMIN LEVELS ARE HIGH AS I MENTION BEFORE THERE'SA HIGH LEVEL OR PROBABI LITY OF DIVERGENT THINKING BUT WHEN DOPAMINE LEVELS GO VERY VERY HIGH THEN THERE'S AGAIN A REDUCTION IN DIVERGENT THINKING IN OTHER WORDS THERE'S A KIND OF A SWEET SPOT OF ELEVATED DOPAMINE FOR DIVERGENT THINKING AND AGAIN DIVERGENT THINKING IS CRITICAL FOR THE CREATIVITY PROCESS BECAUSE CREATIVITY BY DEFINITION IS TAKING A NOVEL SET OF IDEAS AN ARRANGING THEM IN A PARTICULAR WAY OR TAKING EXISTING IDEAS AND ARRANGING THEM IN A NOVEL WAY THAT THEN YOU EVENTUALLY CONVERGE ON SOME NEW PRODUCT NEW IDEA NEW SONG ET CETERA NOW CONVERGENT THINKING FOLLOWS A VERY DIFFERENT PATTERN WHEN DOPAMINE LEVELS ARE HIGH CONVERGENT THINKING IS NOT VERY LIKELY AND WHEN DOPAMINE LEVELS ARE LOW CONVERGENT THINKING IS VERY LIKELY SO HERE USING A ARGUABLY A VERY REDUCTIONIST VIEW WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THIS THING OF RECALLING CREATIVITY THROUGH A VERY NARROW SCIENCY REDUCTIONISTS LENDS WE CAN SAY THIS THE CREATIVE PROCESS INVOLVES GOING INTO A STATE WHERE YOU'RE WILLING TO CONSIDER A LOT OF OPTIONS MANY OF WHICH SEEM DISTANTLY ORE NOT EVEN CONNECTED TO ONE ANOTHER AND DOPAMINE FACILITATES THAT DIVERGENT THINKING STATE IN WHICH YOU ARE PERFECTLY HAPPY AND IN FACT EXPERIENCE A KIND OF A JOY ORE ELATION A COMFORT AND A PLEASURE IN ORGANIZING ALL THESE DIFFERENT IDEAS THAT TO ANY ONE ELSE MIGHT SEEM NOT THAT RELATED BUT WHN YOURDOPAMINE LEVELS ARE ELEVATED THESE ALL SEEM LIKE CRAT IDEAS AND THAT MAY BE THERE ARE CONNECTIONS THERE RIGHT YOU'RE NOT ACCEPTING ALL OF THEM AS TRUE AND VALID AND INTERESTING IN COMBINING THEM BUT THERE'S THIS IDEA THAT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S WORTH INTERTAINING THE POSSIBILITY LEAST FOR MOMENTS AND THEN AS DOPAMINE LEVELS DROP THERE IS THE PROCESS OF CONVERGEN THINKING WHICH IS TAKING OPTIONS DOWN OFF THE WALL SAYING NO NO THAT DOESN'T FIT WITH THAT DOESN'T FIT WITH THAT BUT AH THAT FITS WITH THAT AND THAT CAN WORK THAT FEELS RIGHT OR SOUNDS RIGHT OR LOOKS RIGHT THAT'S THE CREATIVITY PROCESS AND SO I THINK THIS IS NOT JUST IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING CANABAS WHICH WILL GET BACK TO IN A MOMENT BUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING CREATIVITY AND BRAIN STATES IN GENERAL BRAIN STATES ARE NOT AS WE WOULD SAY A SQUARE WAYE FUNCTION YOUW JUST DROP INTO A TRENCH OF CREATIVITY CREATIVITY IS NOT AN EVENT IT'S A PROCESS AND WHAT I'M TELLING YOU THAT S A PROCESS INVOLVES DIVERGENT THINKING AN CONSIDERATION A LOT OF DIFFERENT IDEAS THAT'S CORRELATED WITH HIGH BUT NOT TOO HIGH DOPAMI AND THEN ONE HAS TO TRANSITION INTO A STATE OF CONVERGENT THINKING WHICH IS REALLY HOMING IN ON THE IDEAS THAT SEEM TO HAVE VALIDITY OR THAT COULD HAVE VALIDITY AND GETTING RID OF EVERYTHING ELSE AND THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH LOW DOPAMINE IT'S MORE ABOUT LOGICAL IMPLEMENTATION AND CONSIDERATION AS OPPOSED TO THINKING ABOUT AND CONSIDERING EVERYTHING SO LET'S NOW RETURN TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER NOT CANIBUS AND IT'S DIFFERENT COMPONENTS INCREASE CREATIVITY AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LITERATURE ON THIS YOU FIND STUDIES THAT VERY CLEARLY POINT TO A YES IT INCREASES CREATIVITY AND IT'S NOT SURPRISING THEREFORE THAT CANABAS CAN INCREASE DOPEMIN TRANSMISSION THAT IS DOPAI LEVELS IN CERTAIN BRAIN AREAS PRTTY THE BRAINAR AS INVOLVED IN THINKING AND PLANNING O CASO CANABAS INCREASES DOPEMING IN THESE AREAS ELEVATE DOPAMEN IN CREASES DIVERGENT THINKING AND DIVERGEN THING IS ASSOCIAT WITH CREATIVITY AND THER ARE STUDIES THAT SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT CANABAS CAN INCREASE CREATIVITY HOWEVER THERE ORE AT LEAST AS MANY STUDIES THAT SAY THAT CANABAS DOES NOT INCREASE CREATIVITY THAT CANABAS INCREASES CONSIDERATION OF MULTIPLE IDEAS PERHAPS THROUGH ELEVATION OF DOPAMINE AND RELATED SYSTEMS BUT THAT ULTIMATELY THE IDEAS THAT CONVERGED FROM THAT ARE NOT TRULY CREATIVE IDEAS AT LEAST THEY DON'T MAKE THE CRITERIA FOR CREATIVE BRAIN STORMING AN EXTRACTION OF IDEAS THAT ARE TRULY NOVEL SO IT DOESN'T INCREASE CREATIVITY SO WHICH ONE IS IT WELL FORTUNATELY THEREIS AN ENTLY DISTINCT THAT OF LITERATURE THAT IS TAKEN ALL THE OTHER LITERATURE INTO CONSIDERATION AND HERE'S WHERE WE ARRIVE SO THERE'S A REALLY NICE STUDY THAT EXPLORED CREATIVITHY IN CANABATS USERS AND WE WILL PROVIDE A LINTO THE STUDY A FIRST AUTHOR IS EMILY LA FRANCE AND THE TITLE OF THE PAPER SAYD SOMEWHAT AMUSING  ITS OWN RIGHT WHICH IS AT STARTS WITH A QUESTION INSPIRED BY MARY JANE OF COURSE MARY JANE BEING ONE OF THE AND OF OLD SCHOOL VERSIONS OF OUR WAYS OF TALKING ABOUT CANABAS OR MARUUANA NOWADAYS PEOPLE REFER TO IT MAINGLY AS POT AS OTHER NAMES TO A COURSE AND THE TILE TOF PAPER IS INSPIRED BY MARY JANE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING EN HANCE CREATIVITY IN CANABAS USERS AND I REALLY LIKE THIS STUDY FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS FIRST OF ALL THEY LOOKED AT PEOPLE WHO DID NOT USE CANABAS AS WELL AS PEOPLE WHO USE CANABAS SAY TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS BUT THEY DID NOT A VALUATE CREATIVITY OF THE CANABAS USERS WHILE THEY WERE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CANABAS THEY LOOKED AT THE LEVEL OF CREATIVITY IN THESE CANABAS USERS WHEN THEY WERE NOT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CANABAS AND ASKED WHETHER OR NOT THEIR ABILITY TO BE CREATIVE WAS ENHANCED BY CANABAS NOW WE ARE GOING TO COMPARE THIS TO STUDIES IN WHICH PEOPLE COME INTO THE LABORATORY AND ACTUALLY USE CANABAS AND THAN THEY VALUATE CREATIVITY UNDER THAT CONTEXT BUT THE STUDY AS SOME UNIQUE TAKE WAYS THAT I THINK AR REALLY INTERESTING FIRST OF ALL THEY DID YES SEE EVIDENCE FOR INHANCED CREATIVITY AND WHEN I SAY ENHANCE CREATIVITY I MEAN WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THIS DIVERGENT THINKING THING THAT I TALKED ABOUT A MOMENT AGO AND WHEN I SAY INHANCE I MEAN SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN IN NON USERS SO PEOPLE THAT DON'T USE CANABAS SO RIGHT NOW I CAN IMAGINE THA ALL THE CANABAS USERS ARE ARE ARE CHEERING YES CANABAS INCREASES CREATIVITY MAKES PEOPLE MORE CREATIVE THAN THEY WOULD BE OTHERWISE WELL HIS INTERESTING WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES HOW THAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND TURNS OUT THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR WAYS IN WHICH WAS ACCOMPLISH IS THAT CANABAS USERS EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CANABAS OR FAR MORE OPEN TO NOVEL IDEAS AND THEY HAVE OF MORE EXPLORATIVE AND SO REDUCED ANXIETY OR ISHES A LOWER ANXIETY MODE OF THINKING WHEN THEY EXPLORE NOVEL IDEAS WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR DIVERGENT THINKING SO THEY OBSERVE BOTH ENHANCED DIVERGEN AND CONVERGEN CREATIVE TYPE THINKING IN CANABAS USERS AND THE SOURCE OF THAT THEY CONCLUDE IS AND HERE ALL JUST QUOTE CANABAS USERS HIGHER LEVELS OF OPENNESS TO EXPERIENCE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ENHANC SELF REPORTED CREATIVITY AND CONVERGENT THINKING TEST PERFORMANCE SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT CANABAS IS IN CREASING THE CAPACITY OF THE BRAINAIRIES ARE ASSOCIATE WITH CREATIVITY BUT RATHER CANBAS APPEARS TO BE INCREASING AND OPENNESS AND PROBABLY DOING THAT IN PART THROUGH LOWERING ANXIETY IN PARTICULAR PEOPLE AND THAT OPENNESS IS LEADING TO INCLUSION OF MORE IDEAS DURING THE DE VERGENT THINKING PROCESS RIGHT THEIR WILLING TO CONSIDER THROWING UP MORE THINGS ON THE WALL TO SEE IF THEY STICK SO TO SPEAK SO IN THEIR CONCLUSIONS THEY HAVE A REALLY NICE STATEMENT AGAIN ALL JUST READ OF FROM THE PAPER BECAUSE THEY SAID IT BETTER THAN I EVER COULD QUOTE WHILE MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAS PROPAGATED THE IDEA THAT CANABAS EXPANDS THE MIND AND HANCES CREATIVITY OUR RESULTS SHOWED THE LINK BETWEEN CANABAS AND CREATIVITY IS LARGELY A SPERIOUS CORRELATION MEANING THAT IT'S NOT THE CASE THAT CANABAS INCREASES CREATIVITY BUT AN I IN I INCERTED THE THE BUT IN THIS QUOTE BUT DRIVEN BY DIFFERENCES IN PERSONALITY THAT ARE RELATED TO CANABAS USE FOR EXAMPLE OPENNESS TO EXPERIENCE THAT ARE RELATED TO BOTH CANABAS USE AND AUGMENTED CREATIVITY THIS IS A REAL CHICKEN EGG ARGUMENT WHAT O I MEAN BY THAT WHAT I MEAN IS THIS PAPER FINES THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE OPEN TO EXPERIENCE ARE MORE LIKELY TO USE CANABAS AND PEOPLE WHO USE CANABAS ARE GOING TO BE MORE OPEN TO NEW EXPERIENCES AND THAT COMMINATION OF FEATURES OPENNESS TO EXPERIENCE AND WHAT THAT OPENNESS TO NEW EXPERIENCES BRINGS ENHANCES THE CONVERGENT AND DIVERGENT THINKING THAT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CREATIVE PROCESS SO IN SHORT CANABAS INCREASES CREATIVITY BUT THROUGH CHANGES IN PERSONALITY THAT TAP INTO THE CREATIVE PROCESS RATHER THAN DIRECTLY IMPACTING THE NARAL CIRCUITS THAT FOR INSTANCE TURN ON CREATIVITY AND I HAVE TO SAY THIS STUDY IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE BY EXPLORING CANABAS USERS NOT WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CANABAS THEY WERE ABLE TO TAP INTO THIS VERY IMPORTANT WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE FACT BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT A STUDY IN WHICH YOU WOULD HAVE ONE GROUP USING CANABAS IN ANOTHER GROUP NOT USING CANABAS AND THAN YOU GIVE THEM SOME TASKS THAT TAPS INTO CREATIVITY YOU WILL SEE EFFACTS AND VERY LIKELY YOU'LL SEE EFFECTS WERE CANABAS MIGHT EVEN INCREASE DIVERGEN CONVERGEN THINKING I CREATIVITY THAT THOSE RESULTS AVE ACTUALLY BEEN PUBLISH MANY TIMES BEFORE BUT GIVEN THE VARIED EFFECTS OF CANABAS AND TEATE SEE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER OR ALL THAT COMPLEX SIGNALING STUFF YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THERE WILL ALSO BE OTHER STUDIES THAN IN FACT THERE ARE WHERE DIVERGEN IN CONVERSION THINKING AND CREATIVITY IS NOT ASSISTED BY CANABS AND MIGHT EVEN BE REDUCED BY INJESTING CANABAS HOWEVER IF ONE CONSIDERS THAT DIVERGENT THINKING IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL TO THE CREATIVITY PROCESS AND THE RANGE OF THINGS THAT ONE WILL EXPLORE WILL BE ENHANCED BY OPENNESS AND BY REDUCE LEVELS OF ANXIETY SO A WILLINGNESS TO EXPLORE DIFFERENT OPTION SOME OF WHICH MIGHT SEEM COMPLETELY CRAZY AND CANABAS INCREASES THE PERSONALITY TYPES AND REDUCES THE ANXIETY THAT CREATE THAT SENSE OF OPENNESS WELL THEN IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE WHY CANABAS WOULD INCREASE CREATIVITY IN CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS BUT NOT DIRECTLY AND THIS STUDY THE ONE I JUST REFER TO WHICH I SHOULD SAY WAS PUBLISH IN THE JOURNAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION AGAIN WILL PRO PROVIDALINK TO IT DID A WONDERFUL JOB OF TEASING OUT THIS IMPACT OF CANABASTS ON PERSONALITY WHICH THEN IMPACTS CREATIVITY SO IF SOMEBODY ASKS YOU OR IF YOURE WONDERING OR IF YOU FEEL LIKE CANABAS INCREASES CREATIVITY IN SOME SENSE THE ANSWER IS YES BUT THE ANSWER IS YES BECAUSE OF THE WAYS THAT IT SHAPES OPENNESS TO NEW IDEAS AND CAN SHOULDS A CAN BECAUSE NOT IN EVERYBODY BUT CAN IN SOME INDIVIDUALS REDUCE ANXIETY WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO EXPERIENCES ANXIETY OR INCREASE LEVELS OF FOCUS FROM CANABAS REGARDLESS OF THE STRAIN HIN HEREAFE TO IMAGINE PEOPLE ARE EXPLORING DIFFERENT STRAINS OF THEIR EXPLORING THEM AT ALL EXPLORIN DFFERENT MODES OF DELIVERIES SMOKING OR INJESTABLE ET CETERA IF YOUR SOMEBODY WHO EXPERIENCES ANXIETY IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT YOU WON'T HAVE THE INCREASED OPENNESS TO EXPERIENCE AND DIVERGENT IDEAS THAT WILL FACILITATE CREATIVITY HOWEVER FEW ARE SOMEBODY WHO ACHIEVES HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF RELAXATION AND REDUCE LEVELS OF ANXIETY FROM CANABAS REGARDLESS OF WHICH STRAIN WE HAPPEN TO BE TALKING ABOUT WILL THEND YES IT WILL POSITION YOU TO BE IN A HEIGHTENED STATE OF CREATIVITY AT LEAST AS DEFINED BY CONVERGEN IN DIVERSION THINKING ONE OF THEM MORE CHARACTERISTIC OR I SHOULD SA STEREOTYPE QUALITIES OF PEOPLE THAT SMOKE ALOUTOMAROWANA OR IN JUST CANABAS THROUGH OTHER MEANS IS THEIRE CHANGED PATTERNS OF SPEECH IN FACT THERE'S A KIN OF A LORE IN THE CLINICAL REALM THAT YOU CAN PREDICT OR GET SOME STRONG INDICATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY IS A CANABASTS USER POT SMOKER BASED ON THEIR VOICE AND THE PARTICULAR TONE OF VOICE AND THEIR LACK OF INFLECTION THERE'S LOST SPECULATION HERE BUT FORTUNATELY IT'S BEEN STUDYED I LIKE TO DISCUSS NOW WHETHER OR NOT CANABAS CAN IMPACT PATTERNS OF SPEECH BOTH ACUTELY MEANING WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CANABAS AND OVER TIME IN CHRONIC CANABASUSERS AND WHEN I SAY CHRONIC CANABUS USE I WANT O BE VERY SPECIFIC WHAT I MEAN CHRONIC CANABAS USE DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT PEOPLE ARE SMOKING CANABAS OR INJESTING CANABAS EVERY DAY ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY IF THEY ARE THAT QUALIFIE S CHRONIC USE CHRONIC USE IS REGULAR USE OVER TIME OF ANYWHERE FROM TWICE A WEEK OR MORE SO USING CANABAS ONCE A MONTH WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED CHRONIC USE EVEN OF ITS FOR MANY MANY YEARS USING CANABAS ARE IN JUSTING CANABAS IN SOME WAY OR FORM TWICE A WEEK WOULD BE CONSIDERED CHRONIC USE AN OF COURSE SOMEBOYOU GOUT THERE ARE GOING TO ASK ME TO SPLIT HAIRS AND SHEY WILL WENE OF SOMEBODY USES IT TWICE A MONTH WELL LISTEN A THE CLINICAL LITERATURE AND THE SCIENTIFIC LATURE DON'T GET A THAT SPECIFIC AND OF COURSE THERE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF WAYS TO ARRANGE ONES A CANBAS USE FOR EVERYTHING FROM ZERO NONE AT ALL TO CONSTANTLY EVERYDAY ALL DAY NEVERY WHERE IN BETWEEN BUT THINK OF CHRONIC USE AS TWICE A WEEK OR MORE THINK OF OCCASIONAL USE AS LESS THAN THAT AND REALIZE THAT WITHIN THE REALM OF QUAN CHRONIC USE SCUSE ME THAT OR MORE CAN  ANYWHERE FROM TWICE A WEEK TO EVERY DAY TO JUST IN THE EVENINGS ET CETERA THE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC USE OF CANABAS AS I JUS DEFINED IT ON SPEECH HAVE BEEN STUDIED BECAUSE OF THIS CHARACTERISTIC DRAWING OUT OF CERTAIN SYLLABLES A SLOWING OF SPEECH AND IN MANY CASES A TOTAL CHANGE ERE ALTERATION IN THE WAY THAT PEOPLE SPEEK AND USE LANGUAGE BOTH WHEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CANABAS AND WHEN NOT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CANABAS IF THEY ARE CHRONIC USERS AND HERE WE REALLY WANT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN T H C AND C B D AND JUST MAKE IT REALLY SIMPLE AND SAY THAT C B D IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE PSYCHOACT OF EFFECTS OF CANABAS WERE AS T H C ISE AND AGAIN THE RATIO OF C B D DO T H C IS GOING TO BE RELEVANT THERE BUT LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT CANABAS AND T H C AS ONE AND THE SAME FOR THIS PORTION OF THE DISCUSSION REALIZING THE COURSE THEY ARE NOT EXACTLY THE SAME THING THERE'S AN EXCELLENT STUDY ENTITLED ADULTS WITH HISTORY OF RECREATIONAL CANO BISUSE HAVE ALTERED SPEECH PRODUCTION WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THAT FIRST AUTHOR ADAM VOGAL REALLY LIKE THIS A PAPER IT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL DRUG AND ALCOHOLL DEPENDANTS WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO IT FOR YOU IF YOU'D LIKE TO PERUSE IT IN MORE DETAIL THE TITLE ITSELF ADULTS WIT THE HISTORY OF RECREATIONAL CANABATS USE HAVE ALTERED SPEECH PRODUCTION A TELLS YOU PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW EXCEPT THERE'S SOME IMPORTANT NEWANTS IN HERE BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED EARLY OR PEOPLE WHO SMOKE SETIVA VARIETIES OF CANABAS OFTENTIMES WILL BECOME MORE TALKATIVE MUCH MORE TALKATIVE HOWEVER WHETHER NOT PEOPLE TEND TO RELY ON SETIVA CANABAS USE OR INDICA CANABAS USE THERE IS A VERY CONSISTENT FINDING THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE CHRONIC USERS AGAIN TWICE A WEEK OR MORE RECREATIONAL USE OR MADICINAL USE UNDERGO PRETTY PROFOUND CHANGES IN THE WAY THAT THEY SPEAK BUT IN A VERY SPECIFIC SAID OF WAYS NO FIRST OF ALL THE CHANGES IN SPEECH SHOULDN'T SURPRISE US AT ALL BECAUSE BOTH SETIVA VARIETIES OF CANABAS AND INTICA VARIETIES OF CANABAS IMPACT THOSE BRAIN CENTERS INVOLVED IN MOVEMENT THE BAZAL GANGLIA REMEMBER THE GO NOGO CIRCUITRY THE CIRCUITRY THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO DO THINGS AND THE CIRCUITRY THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO WITHHOLD ACTION AND IT TENDS TO SHIFT THE BODY AND BRAIN TOWARD MORE INACTION AND CANABAS IMPACTS SEE BE ONE RECEPTORS IN THE CEREBELLUM WHICH IS INVOLVED IN MOTOR PLANNING EXECUTION AND BALANCE SO REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT PEOPLE ARE USING CANABAS OF THE SETIVA OR THE INDICA VARIETY THERE ARE DISRUPTIONS IN MOTOR CIRCUITRY AND AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD IF YOU LISTEN TO OUR EPISODE WITH ROCKOFELLER PROFESSOR DOCTOR AR JARVAS WHO WORKS ON SPEECH AND MOVEMENT SPEECH IS MOVEMENT IGHT THE MOVEMENTS OF THE MOUTH THE MOVEMENTS OF THE HANDS THOSE ARE INTIMATELY RELATED IN TERMS OF OUR SPEECH IN FACT THE CENTERS OF THE BRAIN INVOLVED IN HAND MOVEMENTS AR PART OF THE SPEECH ARREAS AN VICE VERSA ERICASHY POINT OUT THAT IF YOU PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK PROVIDED YOU NORMALLY DO HAVE USE OF YOUR HANDS IT ACTUALLY WILL REDUCE YOUR FLUIDITY OF SPEECH AN SO MEN O PUT THEM BACK IN FRONT OF ME NOW THE POINT IS SMOKING MAROWANA OR CONSUMING MARIWUANA BY EDIBALE CHANGES ONE'S SPEECH AND DOES IN A VERY SPECIFIC WAY AND IN THE STUDY BY ADAM VOGALLAND COLLEAGUES THEY EXPLORED A HUGE DIFFERENT VARIETY OF ASPECTS OF SPEECH AND THIS CAN BE DONE USING SPECTRAL PROCESSING WHICH IS YOU KNOW FANCY NERVE SPEAK FOR LOOKING AT HOW MUCH INFLECTION THERE IS ARE LU LOOKING AT HOW LONG PEOPLE HOLD VOWELS OR CONSONANTS ET CETERA AND AGAIN THESE ARE PEOPLE NOT UNDER THE INFLUENCES OF CANABAS BUT RATHER PEOPLE WHO TEND TO BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CANABAS WHEN NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE STUDY ANOTHER WORDS CHRONIC RECREATIONAL CANABAS USERS SO WHAT ARE THE TWO MAJOR SHIFTS THAT CANABAS CAUSES ON OUR PATTERNS OF SPEECH OR THE FIRST ONE IS A CHANGE IN WHAT'S CALLED SPECTRAL TILT CAN THAT'S FANCY NERVES SPEAK FOR VOCAL EFFORT IN INTENSITY SO I'M NOT A POTSMOKER I CONFESS UM BUT IF I WERE TO SAY THE SENTENCE VOCAL EFFORT AND INTENSITY ARE IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF SPEECH THAT'S THE WAY I WOULD SAY THAT SENTENCE IF I WAS STRIVING TO ENUNCIATE VERY CAREFULLY AND TO ACCENT CERTAIN WORDS AND SYLLABLES A POT SMOKER OR SOMEBODY H USES RECREATIONAL CANABAS FAIRLY OFTEN WOULD HAVE REDUCE SPECTRAL TILT A C VOCAL EFFORT INTENSITY AND MIGHT SAY SPECTRAL TILT IS VOCAL EFFORT AND INTENSITY AND IT DIFFERE BETWEEN GROUPS AND APPEAR TO CHANGE IN LINE WITH THE DURATION OF ABSTINENCE FROM CANABAS USE THAT I THINK IS NOT A FAR CRY FROM THE CHANGE IN SPECTRAL TILT THAT THEY OBSERVED HERE IN ADDITION THERE ARE CHANGES IN VERBAL TIMING THAT IS PRONUNCIATION OF WORDS AND ACCENTING PARTICULAR SYLLABLS OF WORDS IN PEOPLE THAT CONSUME CANABAS OR SMOKE CANABAS SO RATHER THEN EMPHASIZE PARTICULAR WORDS WITHIN A SENTENCE SO AGAIN I'LL JIST USE A SENTENCE FROM THE PAPER SO THAT YOU CAN GAIN MORE KNOWLEDGE FROM THE PAPER CANABAS AND I'LL SAY IT THE WAY THAT I WOULD SAY IT SINCE I NOT A CANABAS USER CANABAS MARUWNA IS THE MOST COMMONLY USED ILICIT DRUG IN THE WORLD WITH A PRIMATELY FOUR PER CENT OF ADULTS AGE FIFTEEN TO SIXTY FOUR YEARS REPORTING RECENT USE AND THE CITATION IS FROM THE UNITED NATIONS OFFICE ON DRUGS AND CRIME TWENTY NINETY SO THAT WOULD BE THE WAY THAT I WOULD TYPICALLY READ THAT SENTENCE AND HAVING GONE INTO THE DATE ON THIS PAPER AND OF COURSE A VALUATED REFERENCES THEREIN AND LISTEN TO SOME OF THE SPECTRAL ANALYSIS THAT THEY INCLUDE AS DATA YOU CAN LITERALLY GO INTO THESE PAPERS OME LINE IN HERE RECORDINGS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE CANIBAS USERS OR NON CANIBUS USERS AND I'LL TRY AND GIVE YOU A A CLEAR SENSE WITHOUT PICKING AN EXTREME EXAMPLE OF HOW SOMEBODY WHO'S A A FAIRLY CONSISTENT OR EVEN OCCASIONAL CANIBAS USER MIGHT READ THAT VERY SAME SENTENCE CANABAS MARUWANA IS THE MOST COMMONLY USED ELICIT DRUG IN THE WORLD WITH APPROXIMATELY FOUR PER CENT OF ADULTS AGE FIFTEEN TO SIXTY FOUR YEARS REPORTING RECENT USE AND THE CITATION COMES FROM THE UNITED NATION OFFICE ON DRUGS IN CRIME TWENTY NINETEEN NOW YOU'LL NOTICE THAT WASN'T A DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE AND OF COURSE I COULD HAVE TAKEN THE LIBERTY TO PICK AN EXTREME EXAMPLE OF THE SORT THAT THEY DID OCCASIONALLY OBSERVE IN A VALUATING SUBJECTS FOR THIS PAPER I COULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING LIKE CANABAS MARUWANA IS THE MOST COMMONLY USED ELISSI DRUG BUT FRANKLY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SELECTING AN OUTLIER EXAMPLE AND I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT I DONT WAN TO SKEW THE DATA AS THEY SAY RATHER IF YOU HEARD THE FIRST TIME I READ THE SENTENCE AND THE SECOND TIME I READ THE SENTENCE WHAT'S MAINLY DIFFERENT IS THE DIFFERENT IN THE AMOUNT OF ENUNCIATION AND ACCENTING OF PARTICULAR WORDS AND SYMBOLS WITHIN A SENTENCE SO THE TOTAL CONTENT THAT'S DELIVERED IS EXACTLY THE SAME AND WHILE I WASN'T MEASURING MY PACE THE OVERALL RATE OF COMMUNICATION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME BUT THERE'S LESS SORT OF LILTING AND FALLING OF THE VOICE UN LESS ACCENTING THAT'S THE MAJOR CONSISTENT EFFECT OF CANABAS USE NOW OF COURSE THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE USING A LOT OF CANABAS AND IT IMPACTS BRAIN CENTERS INVOLVED IN MOVEMENT IN SPEECH SO MUCH SO THAT THEY REALLY DO HAVE THE REALLY DRAWN OUT KIND OF NAAN OFTENTIMES THIS WILL BE DETECTED IN THE LAUGH EF THERE'S THI SORT OF STERATYPICAL STONEOR LAUGH AS IT SOMETIMES CALLED RATHER THAN SAY HA HA ORR THAT'S A FAKE LAUGH OBVIOUSLY A I IT'S HARD TO MAKE MYSELF LAUGH IF SOMETHING'S NOT ACTUALLY FONE ENOUGH TO  SOMETHING OF SOMETHING FUNNY EPEOPLEL SAY HA LIKE THAT'S OF A BIT MORE OF THE WAY I MY LAUGH HA SORT OF THE INSPATORY LAUGH UM OR THE HA WHICH IS EXPATORY LAUGH PEOPLE WHO USE CANIBAS CHRONICALLY WILL OFTEN DO THE RIGHT WHICH IS SORT OF THE BACK OF THE THRO IT SORT OF THIS THE A IT'S NEITHER INSPATORY NOR XPATORY LAUGH AND BELIEVE ARE NOT THEREIS AN ENTIRE LITERATURE ON INSPATORY INHAILING VERSIS EXPATORY LAUGHS AND THEIRS ALSO LITERATURE ON CANABASTS ALTERING THE PATTERN OF INSPATORIAN EXPATORY LAUGHS IT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE A SARCASTIC LAUGH WHEN IN FACT THEY MAY NOT BE FEELING SARCASTIC AT ALL AND I HAVE A VERY CLOSE FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE WHOSE A PHENOMINAL NURO SURGEON AND AIR SCIENTISTS BY THE NAME OF DOCTOR ADYCHANGHES THE TURE OF NURSURGERY AT U CYAS F AND HIS LAB AND HIM ARE EXPERT IN THE STUDY OF NAURO SCIENCE CONTROLLING LANGUAGE AND SPEECH AND HE OFTEN TELLS ME THAT HE CAN PREDICT WITH ALMOST CERTAINTY WHETHER NOT SOMEBODY IS A REGULAR CANABAS USER BASE NOT JUST ON THE PATTERNS OF SPEECH THAT THEY USE BUT EVEN JUST BY RECORDING SPECIFIC NURONS IN THEIR BRAIN THAT UNDERLI THE LAUGH REFLEX AND CERTAIN PATERNS OF SPEECH SO THIS IDEA THAT CANABATS USE CHANGES OURABILITY TO SPEAK AN ENUNCIATE CLEARLY DOES APPEAR TO BE TRUE AND THE STEREOTYPE THAT CANABASTS USE TENDS TO CREATE MORE OF A DRALL OR CINOFA UM IF YOU WILL A LAZINESS IN THE LAUGH AND SOME OF THE REFLECIVE ENUNCIATIONS THAT PEOPLE USE DOES ALSO APPEAR TO BE TRUE AND I SAY ALL THAT OF COURSE WITH THE CAVIAT THAT MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE WILL KNOW INDIVIDUALS OR PERHAPS YOU YOURSELVES ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY USE CANABAS BUT THAT HAVE INCREDIBLE ARTICULATION PROBABLY BETTER THAN MINE AND BETTER THAN OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO SPEAK FOR A LIVING SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT ONE HUNDERED PER CENT OF PEOPLE THAT USHUSE CANABASTS REGULARLY CAN'T SPEAK WELL OR CLEARLY THAT SIMPLY NOT WHAT I AM SAYING AND I DON'T WANT TO COMMUNICATE THAT IDEA AT ALL BUT IT IS THE CASE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE REGULAR CANIBISUSERS ARE IMPACTING THE NORAL CIRCUITS INVOLVED IN MOVEMENT MOVEMENT ALSO CONTROL SPEECH AND THEREFOR CANABAS IS IMPACTING SPEECH NOW I LIKE TO TURN OUR ATTENTION TO WHETHER NOT CANABASTS CAN INCREASE SEXUAL ACTIVITY SEXUAL DESIRE AND OR SEXUAL FUNCTION SO WOREGEN O  BE TALKING ABOUT LIBIDO ABOUT SEXUAL DESIRE AND ABOUT EFFECTS OF CANABAS ON HORMONES AND WHILE THIS MIGHT SOUND LIKE A DISCUSSION THAT PURELY ORIENTED TOWARDS RECREATIONAL USE OF CANABAS THAT IS PEOPLE USING CANABAS TO IN HEIGHTENED OR INCREASE THEIR SENSE OF AROUSAL FOR SEXUAL ACTIVITY IT ACTUALLY VENTURES INTO THE CLINICAL REALM TO MEANING THERE HAVE BEEN EXCELLENT PUREVIEWED STUDIES THAT ILL DESCRIBE TO YOU IN A MOMENT EXPLORING THE USE OF CANABSTS OR TH S MORE SPECIFICALLY FOR SOMETHING CALLED HYPOACTIVE SEXUAL DESIRE DISORDER WHICH REFERS TO A PERSISTENT OR RECURRENT DEFICIENCY OR ABSENCE OF SEXUAL FANTACIES AND THOUGHTS AND OR DESIRE FOR OR RESCEPTIVITY TO SEXUAL ACTIVITY THIS IS A DISORDER THAT IS FAIRLY COMMON ANYWHERE FROM SIX TO NINE PER CENT OF PEOPLE BOTH MALES AND FEMALES  USED TO BE CONSIDERED HIGHER PREVALENCE IN FEMALES THAN IN MALES BUT NOW THOSE NUMBERS SEEM TO BE EVENING OUT SO BASICALLY THERE ARE ANYWHERE FROM SIX TO NINE PER CENT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO HAVE VERY DIMINISHE SEXUAL DESIU IRE AND SO A NUMBER OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN FIGURINGOUT WAYS TO INCREASE THEIR AMOUNT OF SEXUAL DESIRE AND OF COURSE THEIR PEOPLE IN THE GENERAL POPULATION WHO MAY NOT HAVE HYPOACTIVE SEXUAL DESIRE DISORDER WHO ARE INTERESTED IN USING CANABUS RECREATIONALLY IN ORDER TO INCREASE THEIR DESIRE FOR OR THEIR EXPERIENCE OF SEXUAL ACTIVITY OW FIRST WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SEXUAL DESIRE AND ACTIVITY IS A COMPLEX SET OF PROCESSES MEANING ITS NOT JUS ONE EVENT SEX THE VERB IT INVOLVES AROUSAL IT INVOLVES SEX THE VERB AND IT INVOLVES A WHOLE SET OF MINE SETS AND EMOTIONAL STATES THAT VERY TREMENDOUSLY BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS BUT ONCE AGAIN WE CAN DISSTILL OUT A FEW BASIC PRINCIPLES AND I SHOULD EMPHASIZE THESE ARE BY NO MEANS THE ONLY CHEMICALS AND NERAL CIRCUITS INVOLVED IN THE SEXUAL ARCHAS WILL CALL IT DESIRE THE ACT OF SEX ET CETERA BUT THEY ARE SENSUAL TO IT THEY ARE VITAL TO IT THEY WOULD BE CONSIDERED WHAT I WOULD CALL NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT OCASO THER'LL BE OTHER CHEMICALS INVOLVED TO BUT THE MAIN CHEMICALS AND NERAL CIRCUITS ARE THOSE INVOLVED IN DOPAMINE SO THE SO CALLED MESOLYMBIC REWARD PATHWAY IN PATICULAR A BRING STRUCTURE CALLED NUCLIOS ECUMBENS WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT MORE IN A MOMENT IS VITAL TO ALL MOTIVATED BEHAVIORS AND TO THE SEEKING OUT OF ALL PARTICULAR TYPES OF PLEASURABLE EXPERIENCES AND SEXES NO EXCEPTION SO WHEN WE HEAR THAT THE NEUCLEOUS ACUMBENS IS ACTIVATED THAT ALMOST ALWAYS MEANS THAT DOPAMINE HAS BEEN RELEASED IN THAT AREA AND OTHER AIRS OF THE BRAIN ANBODY AND WE CAN CONSIDER DOAMINE CENTURAL TO THE DESIRE FOR PURSUITS OF AND ACT OF SEX IN ADDITION TO THAT THEIR MOLECULES LIKE OXYTOSIN WHICH RIVOLVED IN PARBONDING AND THEIR GOING TO BE NERRAL CIRCUIT SPECIFIC TO THE OXYTOS AND CIRCUITRY BUT IN TERMS OF SEXUAL EROUSAL AND SEXUAL BEHAVIOR IT'S REALLY THE DOPAMINE PATHWAY IN THIS NUCLES ECUMBANS WHICH ARE ESPEXUALLY VITAL THAT ALLOWS US TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION DOES CANABUS INCREASE DECREASE OR HAVE NO EFFECT ON SEXUAL DESIRE AND OR THE ABILITY TO HAVE SEX AND THEREIN WE WILL FIND SOME VERY INTERESTING ANSWERS BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN IT WILL POINT TO THE FACT THAT THE EFFECS OF CANIBUS ON DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS CAN BE HIGHLY DIVERGENT MEANING IN ONE SET OF INDIVIDUALS CANABUS WILL MAKE THEM FAR LESS ANXIOUS AND IN ANOTHER SET OF INDIVIDUALS THE SAME STRAIN OF CANABUS AT THE SAME DOSAGE WILL MAKE THEM EXTREMELY ANXIOUS THE SAME CAN BE SAID ALSO OF SEXUAL ACTIVITY AND THIS WAS BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATED IN THE CONTEXTS OF SEXUAL DESIRE IN THE JOURNAL PSYCHOPHORMOCOLOGY IN A PAPER PUBLISH IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE TITLE OF THIS PAPER IS INDIVIDUAL PROLACTIN REACTIVITY MODULATES RESPONSE OF NEUCLEOUS ECUMBENTS TO EROTIC STIMULE DURING ACUTE CANABUS INTOXICATION AN EPHEMARI PILOT STUDY SO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF A DEFINITION TO SOME OF THE TERMS IN THE TITLE THAT WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE PAPER BUT THEN I'LL JUST MARCH TO THE RESULTS BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND VERY INTERESTING EFIMORI IS JUST FUNCTUONAL MAGNETIC RESINENTS IMAGING SOBASICALLY SUBJECTS IN THIS EXPERIMENT CAME IN TO THE LABORATORY THEY WERE EITHER PEOPLE WHO HAD NOT USED CANABAS BEFORE OR WHO HAD USED CANABAS BEFORE THEY WERE PLACE INTO A BRAIN SCANDER ONE OF THESE EFAMORI DEVICES IT LOOKS LIKE A TUBE THAT PEOPLE ARE BACKED UP IN TO ON A AND THEN THEY CAN VIEW IMAGES AND THERE AND THEIR BRAIN CAN BE IMAGED WITHOUT HAVING TO REMOVE ANY SKULL OR DRILL INTO THE SCALL NO NURRO SURGERY THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS STUDY WERE GROUPED ACCORDING TO WHETHER NOT THEY HAD EXPERIENCED ANY APHRODEGIAC EFFECTS DURING THE INTOXICATION WITH CANABA SO THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST GROUP GROUP A THEY LITERALLY CALLE IT GROUP A FOR APHRODEGIAC AND THEN THE SECOND GROUP AND THIS THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE STUDIES RATHER THAN CALL IT GROUP B THEY CALLED THEM GROUP NON A WHICH IS A JUST GETS A LITTLE CONFUSING SO I'LL TRY AND SIMPLIFI LE THIS THEY ARE TWO GROUPS AND ONE GROUP EXPERIENCES SEXUAL EROUSAL WHEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CANABAS T H C SPECIFICALLY THE OTHER GROUP DOES NOT  IT TURNS OUT THIS IS A VERY COMMONLY OBSERVE DIVERGENCE OF OF FACTS OF CANABAS SOME PEOPLE EXPERIENCE A LOT OF SEXUAL AROUSAL FROM CANABAS AND T  IN PARTICULAR AND SOME PEOPLE DO NOT IN FACT THEY EXPERIENCE SUPPRESSION OF SEXUAL DESIRE AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ELOBIT MYSTERIOUS AS TO WHY THAT IS WELL IN THIS STUDY THEY SHOWED PEOPLE IN BOTH GROUPS ERODIC IMAGES AND THEY MEASURED SEXUAL AROUSAL THROUGH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MEASURES WE WON'T GO INTO ALL THAT IT WAS LARGELY SUBJACTIVE THERE BEEN OTHER STUDIES WHERE THEY'VE ACTUALLY MEASURED THINGS LIKE ERECTIONS AND MALES AND VASIONAL LUBRICATION AND FEMALES THIS ARE SO CALLED AUTONOMIC RESPONSES THAT PEOPLE CAN'T LIEABOUT A A SO TO SPEAK AND THAT TAP INTO OTHERASPECTS OF THE SO CALLED SEXUAL AROUSAL PROCESS IN THIS STUDY THEY ALSO TOOK BLOOD SAMPLES TO LOOK AT THE CONCENTRATION OF THINGS LIKE CAN AVONOIDS SO THIS IS A REALLY NICE STUDYING THAT THETSHE MEASURED HOW MUCH T H C WAS IN THE BLOOD STREAM IN DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS WHO REACTED TO THESE ERRATIC STIMULAIN DIFFERENT WAYS AND THEY MEASURED HORMONES NAMELY CARTIS ALL WHICH IS A STRESS HARMONE WHICH TENDS TO NEGATIVELY CORRELATE WITH SEXUAL ROUSAL AN PROLACTIN AND THE INTERESTING TAKE AWAY FROM THE STUDY WAS THAT FOR PEOPLE AND IT DIDN'T MATTER IF IT WAS MALES OR FEMALES CAUSE THEY LOOKED AT BOTH FOR PEOPLE THAT EXPERIENCE ELEVATED PROLACTIN LEVELS UNDER CANABAS INTOXICATION THAT'S HOW THEY REFERRED TO IT PEOPLE TAKE CANABAS THEY MEASURE PROLACT AND SOME PEOPLE HAD ELEVATED PROLACT AN SOME PEOPLE DID NOT  FOR THE PEOPLE THAT HAD ELEVATED LEVELS OF PROLACTIN THEY DID NOT OBSERVE ACTIVATION OF BRAIN AREAS ASSOCIATE WITH SEXUAL AROUSAL IN THIS CASE THE RIGHT NUCLY SECUMBENCY OF TO N LIOS SECOMBY IGUSLY BE CALLED ONE ON EACH SIDE THE BRAIN AND THE ACTIVATION OF THAT BRANARY IS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH DOPAMINE AND WITH AROUSAL AND SEXUAL ROUS IN PARTICULAR IN THE STUDY AND IF PEOPLE AT ELEVATED PROLACTIN THEY DID NOT EXPERIENCE ACTIVATION OF NEWCLES ECUMMONS AND THEY DID NOT REPORT FEELING SEXUALLY AROUSE TO THOSE PICTURES AT LEAST NOT TO THE SAME DEGREE AS THE OTHER GROUP SO SOME PEOPLES PROLACTIN LEVELS GO UP WHEN THEY IN JEST CANABAS AND THOSE PEOPLE DO NOT ACHIEVE ELEVATE LEVELS OF SEXUAL AROUSAL WHEN UNDER TE INFLUENCE OF CANABAS EVEN IF THEIR LOOKING AT ERATIC STIMULE THAT MAKE SENSE BECAUS PROLACT IN IS MUTUALLY INHIBITORY AS WED SAY ITS ANABIN A PUSHPULL WITH DOPEMING WHEN DOPEMING LEVELS ARE HIGH PROLACD IN LEVELS TEN TO BELOW AND WHEN PROLACTIN LEVELS ARE HIGH DOPAMING LEVELS TEN TO BELOW THE OTHER GROUP SO CALLED GROUP A THAT EXPERIENCE ELEVATED LEVELS OF SEXUAL AROUSAL WHEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CANABAS AND VIEWING EURAUDIC STIMULE THAT GROUP DID NOT SHOW ELEVATED LEVELS OF PROLACIN IN RESPONSE TO CANABAS SO THIS I BELIEVE RESOLVES A LONG STANDING CONTROVERSY IN THE FIELD WHICH IS DOES CANABAS INCREASE SEXUAL AROUSAL WELL IT DEPENDS IF YOU FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF PERSON WHO HAS ELEVATED LEVELS OF PROLACEIN IN RESPONSE TO CANABAS THEN NO ACTUALLY CANABAS WILL SUPPRESS YOUR SEXUAL RESPONSE AND DESIRE IF HOWEVER YOU ARE IN THE CATEGORY OF PERSON THAT DOES NOT HAVE ELEVATED LEVELS OF PROLACET IN IN RESPONSE TO CANABAS WILL THEN ERAUD IC STIMULE CAN POTENTUALLY AND IN FACT DO INCREASE SEXUAL AROUSAL IN THE MAJORITY OF INDIVIDUALS NOW MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY HEARING THIS AND WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT YOU FALL IN TO ONE CATEGORY OF INDIVIDUAL OR ANOTHER AND THE KEYTHING HERE TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT LEVELS OF PROLACT IN HEADING INTO THE STUDY DID NOT PREDICT DID NOT PREDICT WHETHER NOT PEOPLE WOULD RESPOND TO CANABAS WITH ELEVATED OR NON ELEVATED OR EVEN REDUCE LEVELS OF SEXUAL AROUSAL IT WAS WHETHER NOT PEOPLES PROLACT IN LEVELS WHEN UP OR DID NOT GO UP THAT PREDICTED WHETHER NOT THEIR LEVELS OF AROUSAL WOULD GO UP OR NOT SO IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO YES DOES EXPERIENCE ELEVATED LEVELS OF SEXUAL AROUSAL AND FUNCTION WHEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CANABAS THAT'S VERY LIKELY THAT CANABAS DOES NOT INCREASE YOUR PROLACETIN LEVELS AT LEAST NOT TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE WHILE YOU'RE TAKING IT AND IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO DOES NOT EXPERIENCE INCREASES IN SEXUAL ROUSAL OR FUNCTION OR EVEN DIMINISH SEXUAL ROUSAL AND FUNCTION WHEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CANABAS IT'S VERY LIKELY THE CANABAS IS INCREASING YOUR LEVELS OF PROLACTON UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NO WAY TO NOWHERE PREDICT BASED ON SOME OTHER MEASURE I THINK THE OUTCOME MEASURE THAT IS INCREASED OR NOCTD INCREASE OR EVEN REDUCE SEXUAL ROUSAL IS REALLY THE LIPNOS TEST BY WHICH ONE CAN FIGURE THAT OUT WHILE WE ARE ON THE TOPIC OF THE EFFECTS OF CANABAS ON SEXUAL FUNCTION AND HORMONES LIKE PROLACTIN PROBABLY WORTH MENTIONING THE CANIBUS HAS BEEN STUDIED EXTENSIVELY FOR ITS IMPACT ON OTHER HORMONES AND WE CAN SUMMARISE THOSE LITERATURE IN THE FOLLOWING WAY AND HERE ON REFERING TO STUDIES ONLY ON ADULTS WEILL TALK ABOUT THE DEVELOPING BRAIN AN BODY IN A LOBIT BUT IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT SMOKING CANAIBUS INCREASES PROLACTIN LEVELS VERY VERY CLEAR NOW YOU MIGHT SAY IDIDN'T YOU JUST DESCRIBE A STUDY ABOUT A SET OF INDIVIDUALS WHOSE PROLACTIN DIDN INCREASE AND AS A CONSEQUENCE THEYRE LEVEL SEXUAL DESIRE WENT UP YES THERE ARE SUBSET OF INDIVIDUALS FOR WHICH THATS TRUE BUT PEOPLE WHO SMOKE CANIBAS DU EXPERIENCE INCREASES IN PROLACTIN AND THAT ESPECIALLY PRONOUNCED IN PEOPLE THAT SMOKE CANIBUS MORE THAN TWICE A WEEK SO THIS IS IMPORTANT PROLACTIN AS A REFERRED TO EARLIER IS RECYPROCAL R MUTUALLY IN HIBITORY WITH DOPAMINE ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS IN THE CONTECTS OF THE NORMAL SEXUAL AROUSAL ARC WHEREBY DOPAMIN IS INCREASED WHEN PEOPLE ARE SEXUALLY ROUSED BUT THEN AFTER ORGASM BOTH IN MALES AND FEMALES PROLACTIN LEVELS SKYROCET THIS IS ACTUALLY WHAT CREATES THE SO CALLED REFACTORY PERIOD FOR MAILS DURING WHICH THEY CANNOT ACHIEVE ERECTION AGAIN FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME THAT RELATES DIRECTLY TO HOW LONG THE PROLACTIN INCREASE LASS PROLACTIN IS ALSO INCREASED IN NEW PARENTS OF ALL SPECIES INCLUDING HUMANS WHICH AT LEAST PARTIALLY EXPLAIN SOME OF THE REPORTED OR TYPICAL REDUCTIONS IN SEXUAL DESIRE AND ACTIVITY IN NEW PARENTS NOW THEREARE OTHER REASONS FOR THAT TWO SLEEP DEPROVATION BUT NATURE IS SMART AND HAS ARRANGED A SET OF HORMONES AND CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY SUCH THAT WHEN TENDING TO A NEWBORN IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IT RELEGATES IT REDUCES THE IMPORTANCE OF PRODUCING MORE CHILDREN AND SEXUAL ACTIVITY IN THOSE MOMENTS AND DAYS AND WEEKS SOMETIMES LONGER SO WHEN PROLACTIN LEVELS ARE UP DOBUMI LEVELS ARE DOWN SMOKING MAROUANA MORE THAN TWICE A WEEK SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES PROLACTIN THERE ARE FEWER STUDIES EXPLORING WEATHER NOT EDIBLE MARIWANA HAS THE SAME EFFECT ALTHOUGH THE PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE SUGGEST THAT IT DOES NOT I GET INTO THIS IN A LOT MORE DETAIL IN A FUTURE EPISODE ALL ABOUT HORMONES WITH DOCTOR CALGULET WHO'S BEEN ON THIS PODCAST BEFORE BUT HE VERIFIED THAT AND MY READ OF THE LITERATURE IS THAT THE EDIBLE FORMS OF MAROWANA CANIBUS PROBABLY AGAIN LET'S PUT AN ASTRICTS NEXTS TO THIS BUT IT APPEARS DO NOT HAVE AS MUCH OF A PROLACT IN ELEVATING EFFECT AND THEREFORE NOT AS MUCH OF A DOPAMINE SUPPRESSIVE EFFECT AND THEREFORE NOT AS MUCH OF A TESTOSTERON SUPPRESSING EFFECT AND THAT GETS THE ISSUE OF TO STOSTRONE DOES CANIBUS MAROUANA SUPPRESSD O STSTRONE AND THIS IS A VERY CONTROVERSIAL LITERATURE AND HERS WHY SOME STUDIES S AY YES IT SUPPRESSES TESTOSTRON IN MALES AND FEMALES AND KEEP IN MIND THAT TESTOSTERON AND FEMALES IS VITAL FOR LEBIDO AND COGNA FUNCTION CELLAR REPAIR ET CETERA S NOCIOUS IMPORTANT IN MALES OF COURSE HOWEVER OTHER STUDIES SAY THAT CANABAS DOES NOT DECREASE TESTSTRONE AND IT SEEMS TO DEPEND ON WEATHER NOT THE CANABASTS IS BROUGHT INTO THE SYSTEM BY WAY OF SMOKING OR EDABLE AND IT SEEMS TO DEPEND ON WEATHER R NOT THE CANABAS IS USED CHRONICALLY BY AN INDIVIDUAL OR ACUTELY AND HERE I JUST WANT ZUMOUT AND SAY THAT STUDIES ON CANABAS OR DRUGS OF ANY KIND IN HUMANS ARE REALLY COMPLICATED IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT SO ONE HAS TO COME INTO THE LABORATORY AND LETS SAY YOU WANT TA STUDY CHRONIC CANABAS USE WE CAN'T KEEP THEM IN THE LABORATORY ALL THE TIME SO YOU HAVE TO RELY ON THEIR SELF REPORT OF HOW OFTEN THEY USE CANABAS AND IN WHAT FORM AND YOU CAN'T REALLY CONTROL FROM ONE INDIVIDUAL TO THE NEXT OF HOW MUCH CANABAS AND T EITHER BRING INTO THEIR SYSTEM ONE PERSON MIGHT SMOKE CANBAS OUT OF A BONG AND TAKE BIG DEEP UNOLUNGSFUL BONG IN HELATIONS OR SUCH OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT SMOKE JOINTS OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT USE EDIBLES IT BECOMES VERY COMPLICATED TO KNOW WHAT PEOPLE HAVE DONE AND THAT THEIR REPORTING ACCURATELY AND NO JOKE HERE ESPECIALLY IF MARIWNAS IMPACTING THE SHORT TURN MEMORY SYSTEMS THEY MIGHT NOT ACTUALLY REMEMBER THEY MIGHT NOT BE TRACTING IT THAT WELL CONTRASTS THAT WITH STUDIES OF THE ACUTE USE OF CANABAS AND T SE WHERE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT REGULAR USERS COME INTO THE LABORATORY AND NOW SUDDENLY WITH INSTITUTIONAL GUID LINES AND SAFETY PROTICALS ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF T S IN CANABAS WHILL NOW YOU'RE DEALING WITH A PERSON WHO MAY NOT HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH THE ELEVATED HEART RATE AND BLOOD PRESSURE THATS CHARACTERISTIC OF CANABAS CAUSE IT IS A STIMULAN AT LEAST WHEN INITIALLY BROUGHT INTO THE SYSTEM EVEN IF IT MIGHT EVENTUALLY TO RELAXATION SO NOW YOU GOT SOM ONE WHO IS ANXIOUS OR SOMEBODY WHOWAS NOT ANXIOUS IS DEEPLY RELAXED NYOUR TRY TO STUDY THESE EFFECTS SO ITS OF IT'S A MOVING TARGET OF SORTS AND VERY COMPLICATE TO STUDY MARIWANA AND CANABAS IN ITS VARIOUS DERIVATIVS IN THIS WAY NOW YOU CAN PROBABLY APPRECIATE BETTER AS TO WHY THERES SO LITTLE NUANTS DATA ABOUT CETIVA VERSES INDICA VERSES DIFFERENT RATIOES OF SEEBDY AN TC ITS REALLY DIFFICULT TO DO THESE STUDIES IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT SAID THE GENERAL RULES ARE SMOKING MARIWANA INCREASES PROLACTIN AN MEN AND WOMEN WHICH WILL REDUCE DOPAMINE AND TESTOSTRONE SMOKING MARIWANA CHRONICALLY MEANING MORE THAN TWICE A WEEK DOES APPEAR TO REDUCE TESTOSTRONE SIGNIFICANTLY AND ELEVATE SO CALLED AROMATACES ENZIMES TO THE ENSIMES THAT CONVERT TESTOSTRON INTO ASTROGEN THIS MIGHT PARTIALLY EXPLAIN THE EFFECT THAT OCCURS IN ABOUT THIRTY FIVE PER CENT OF MALES WHICH IS GANACAMASTIO WHICH IS A DEVELOPMENT OF BREAST TISSUE IN MALES IN PARTICULAR YOUNG MALES WHO HAVE ELEVATED LEVELS OF TESTOSTRON OR WHO ARE TAKING EXOGONOS TESTOSTRON FOR TESTSTERO REPLACEMENT THERAPE OR IF THEY'RE TAKING HYDOS IS ANIBAL IC STEROIDS OR IN FEMALES THAT INCREASE IN BREAST SIZE WHICH IS DUE TO ADDITIONA L ESTEROGEN FROM TESTOSTERON CONVERTED TO ESTEROGEN SO IT DOES APPEAR THAT MARIWANAN CANIBUS INCREASE ESTROGEN REDUCE TESTOSTERON INCREASE PROLACTIN ESPECIY IN CHRONIC USERS NOW I AM SURE THAT SOMETY LOUT THERE WILL SAY WELL THEIR TESTOSTERONE LEVELS ARE EXCEEDINGLY HIGH OR THEY ARE FINE MEANING THE CONSTELLATION OF SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED LOW TESTOSTERON AN ELEVATE ESTEROGEN ARE NOT PRESENT IN THEM THAT PROBABLY MEANS ONE OF TWO THINGS OR BOTH THEY EITHER HAD ELEVATE LEVELS OF TESTOSTERONE TO BEGIN WITH SO THEIR SEALING WAS HIGER SO BRINGING IT DOWN DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH OF EFFECT OR THAT THEY HAVE VERY LOW LEVELS OF AROMATASTES IN THEIR SYSTEM THERE ARE SOME ANICDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT SMOKING PARTICULAR PARTS OF THE MARIWANA PLANT IN PARTICULAR THE CEDS CAN INCREASE A ROMATASTES AND THE CONVERSION OF TESTOSTERON TESTEROGEN I THINK IN THE OLD DAYS THE LOWER WAS THE SEEDS MAKE OU STERIL AND I THINK THAT WAS RELATED TO WHAT I JUST TOLD YOU THIS INCREASE IN CONVERSION OF TESTOSTERON TESTEROGEN THEREIS A VAST LITERATURE ON THE EFFECTS OF CANIBUS ON FERTILITY IT DOES SEEM YES IT DOES SEEM TO ALTER SPERM MOTILITY AND SPIRM HEALTH AND FUNCTION WHEN TAKING CHRONICALLY MORE THAN TWICE PER WEEK IN PARTICULAR HIDOSES OF HGH POTENC T  C THE I SOMETHING WE WILL COVER AN FARMORE DETAIL ON A FUTURE EPISODE ALL ABOUT FERTILITY AND IN FEMALES THERE IS AN INCREASE IN ESTEROGEN AS A CONSEQUENSOF SMOKING MARIWANA AND INCREASING PROLACTIN IN ESTEROGEN IN PARALLEL WHETHER NOT THAT DETROMENTAL IS IN CLEAR ALTHOUGH I POINT OUT THAT ELEVATED ESTEROGEN AND PROLACTIN CAN BE ASSOCIATED AGAIN CAN BE ASSOCIATED NOT NECESSARILY AND CERAINLY NOT CAUSITIVE BUT CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH ELEVATE LEVELS OF OR FREQUENCY OF BREAST CANCER DETECTION SO CANIBUS AND ITS EFFECTS ON HORMONES ARE NOT WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE THERE ARE EFFECTS OF CANIBUS ON CORTISAL IN SOME INDIVIDUALS IT GREATLY INCREASES CORTISALL TO THE ANXIETY AND PARANOIA IT CAN CREATE AND IN OTHER INDIVIDUALS IT REDUCES CORTISALL AGAIN WE HAVE THESE DIVERGENT EFFECTS BUT I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THE EFFECTS ON PROLACTON MEANING ELEVATED PROLACT IN THE EFFECTS ON TESTOSTERON MEANING AT LEAST MOST STUDIES POINT TO REDUSE LEVELS OF TESTOSTERON AND INCREASED ESTEROGEN THAT SEEMS TO BE TRUE FROM MOST ALL INDIVIDUALS THAT CHRONICALLY USE CANIBAS WHEREAS THE EFFECTS ON CORTISALTAN TO BE DIVERGENT CANNIBAS INCREASES CORTISAL AN SOME INDIVIDUALS AND DECREASES CORTISALL AND OTHERS IN GENERAL INCREASES IN CORTISALL THAT ARE ON GOING ARE NOT HEALTHY FOR US AND SO ON AND THEN OF COURSE THERE ARE OTHER EFFECTS ON HORMONES ANDAL JUST BRIEFLY SUMMARISE THOSE THAT T H C IN PARTICULAR NOT S B D BUT T H  IN PARTICULAR IS KNOWN TO BE STRONGLY INHIBITORY FOR SOMETHING CALLED GANATATROPE AN RELEASING HORMONE THIS IS A HORMONE THAT'S RELEASED FROM THE BRAIN FROM THE HYPOPHALEMUS THAT THEND FEEDS ON TOO WHERE I SHOULD SAY SIGNALS TO THE POTUITORY GLAND WHICH IS ALSO NEAR THE ROUD FOR YOUR MOUTH LOTISTOF HAPPENING OR THE REFER MOUTH THAT TURNS OUT BIOLOGICALLY AND REDUCE LEVELS OF GANADATROPE AND RELEASING HORMONE CAUSED BY CANABAS USE REDUCE LEVELS OF ALLACE LUTINIZING HORMON A NEPHAS AGE WHICH REDUCE LEVELS OF TESTOSTRONE AND SPERM PRODUCTION IN MALES AND EGG HEALTH AND OVULATION AND MINSTRUAL FUNCTION AND FEMALES NOW I AM SURE THERE ARE NUMBER OF WOMEN OUT THERE WHO WILL SAY THEY HAVE PERFECTLY NORMAL MENSTRUAL PSYCLES TO SPITE USING CANABAS I'M SURTNLY NOT CAN DISPUTE THAT BUT IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO TRING TO MAXIMIZE FERTILITY OR REGULATE OR BALANCE HORMONES MEROUANA AN CANABAS REDUCES GEANAR AGE THAT IS THE GANADATROPE AND RELEASE FROM THE HYPOFHALMAS AND THEREBY REDUCES LUTINIZING HORMON AND PHOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE WHICH ARE RELEASED FROM THE PETUITARY AND TRAVEL IN THE BLOOD STREAM TO SUPPORT NORMAL OVARIAN FUNCTION AND HEALTH AND NORMAL TESTICULAR FUNCTION AND HEALTH IN FEMALES AND MALES RESPECTIVELY UP UNTIL NOW I'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THE BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF CANABAS NOW I LIKE TO SHIFT OUR ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS OF CANABAS AND SHINE LIGHT ON SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS OUT THERE THAT NEED TO BE ESPECIALLY WARY OF AND PROBABLY AVOID CANABS USE ENTIRELY INCLUDING INGESTION OF CANABAS BY A WAY OF ADIBAL AND I FRAME THINGS THAT WAY BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE IS AN INCREASINGLY LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT APPRECIATE THAT SMOKING TOBACCO OR SMOKING CANABAS VAPING TOBACCO YES VAPING TOBACCO OR VAPING CANABAS EACH AND ALL HAVE NEGATIVE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES ON THE LUNGS AND ON THE SO CALLED AND TETHELIAL CELLS OF THE BODY THE CELLS THAT NAKE UP THE VASCULATES ARE THE CAPILARIES AND BLOOD VESSELS IF YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW THAS I'LL MAKE IT VERY CLEAR ANDI'LL MAKE IT VERY BRIEF WHETHEROR NOT YOU SMOKE OR VAPE TOBACCO OR CANABAS YOU ARE SEVERELY IMPAIRING THE FUNCTION OF ANDETHELIAL CELLS THAT MAKE UP THE CAPILARIES AND BLOOD VESSELS OF YOUR BRAIN AND BODY AND THAT IS KNOWN TO DECREASE COGNIVE CAPACITY OVER TIME INCREASE PROBABILITY OF STROKES SEVERELY IMPACT LUNG FUNCTION AND ALSO LEAD TO THINGS LIKE PERFERAL NAUROPOTHES IT LEADS TO SECTUAL DISFUNCTION BECAUSE OF LACK OF BLOOD FLOW TO THE JANABALS CAN LEAD TO OTHER ASPECTS OF REPRODUCTIVE DAMAGE INCLUDING TO THE OVERIES INTESTES ESSENTIALLY THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO STATE IT EXCEPT THAT SMOKING AND VAPING HAVE NEGATIVE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE SUBSTANCES THAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET INTO THEIR BLOOD STREAM BY SMOKING ARE VAPING SO PEOPLE SMOKE IN VAPE TOBACCO AND PEOPLE SMOKE IN VAPE CANABAS AND IN BOTH CASES IF WE JUST SET ASIDE THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF TOBACCO AND THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF CANABAS WE CAN CONFIDENTLY SAY THAT THE PROCESS OF SMOKING OF INHALING SMOKE INTO THE LUNG AND YES ALSO VAPING BRINGING THE CHEMICALS THAT TRANSPORT NICOTINE OR IN THIS CASE CANABUS IN THE LUNGS BY WAY OF VAPING ARE BOTH SEVERELY DETRIMENTAL TO ANY ETHEOLIAL SELVES I THINK A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN VAPING WASN'T AS PROMINENT THERE WAS THIS QUESTION AND THIS IDEA THAT MAY BE VAPING WAS GOING TO BE FAR HEALTHIER OR AT LEAST NOT AS BAD AS SMOKING BUT NOW WE CAN CEE A HUGE NUMBER OF NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS OF VAPING SOME OF WHICH ARE DISTINCT FROM THE EFFECTS OF SMOKING SO IF YOU LIKE MORE INFORMATION ON SMOKING VERSES VAPING PLEASE C THE EPISODE THAT I DIDO NICOTINE WE WILL ALSO DO AN ENTIRE EPISODE ALL ABOUT VAPING IN THE FUTURE BUT THERE'S REALLY NO WAY TO SLICED AND DICED OR CANDY COT IT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT SMOKING HAS CLEAR AND SEVERE NEGATIVE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT YOUR SMOKING TOBACCO OR CANABUS T H C AND VAPING HAS NEGATIVE HALTH CONSEQUENCES WHETHER OR NOT YOUARE USING THE VAPE TO BRING IN NICOTIN OR T H C OR SOME COMMINATION OF T H  AND C B D SIMPLY THE WAY IT IS WITH THAT SAID NOW I LIKE TO FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON THE DIRECT EFFECTS THAT CANABUS HAS EITHER BY WAY OF T H C ACTION OR BY WAY OF C B D ACTION IN TERMS OF POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN AND BODY AND WE'RE GOING TO EXPLORE THAT FIRST AS A FUNCTION OF AGE AND THE REASON WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT IS RELATED TO A FACT THAT I MENTION THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE WHICH IS THAT THE C B WONE AND THE C B TWO RECEPTORS THE TWO RECEPTORS FOR CANABUS TO WHICH T H C N C B D AND C B ND AND ALL OTHER CYCHLACTOF COMPOUNDS OF CANABUS BIND TO TO HAVE THEIR ACTIONS ARE PRESENT THROUGHOUT DEVELOPMENT BELIEVE IT OR NOT THEY ARE PRESENT VERY SOON AFTER CONCEPTION AND THE C B ONE AND S B TWO RECEPTORS ACTUALLY PLAY A CRITICAL ROLL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FEDUS NOW YOU MIGHT WONDER WHY THAT IS BECAUSE OF COURSE THE DEVELOPING FEDUS DOESN'T NECESSARILY EXPECT TO C CANABUS OR TO BE EXPOSED TO CANABUS IN T H C N C B D BUT AS YOU RECALL IN DOGENOUS CANABINOIDS ARE PRESENT IN THE ADULT BRAIN AND BODY AND IN DOGENOUS CANABINOIS IT TURNS OUT ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE DEVELOPING FTUS IN FACT INDOGEOUS CANABINOIS ARE PRESENT AT MUCH GREATER LEVELS THAN THE DEVELOPING FETUS THAN THEY ARE AFTER A CHILD IS BORN AND LEVELS OF INDOGENOUS CANABINOIS ACTUALY GO DOWN ACROSS DEVELOPMENT I FIND THIS REALLY INTERESTING WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT IN DOGENOUS CANABINOIS AN ACTIVATION OF THE S B ONE AND S B TWO RECEPTORS ARE IN INTERGAL PART OF NERAL DEVELOPMENT AND THIS IS GOING TO BECOME A SPECIALLY RELEPVENT IN CONSIDERING WHETHER R NOT PREGNANT MOTHERS SHOWDER SHOULD NOT USE CANABUS OR C B D AND IT ALSO POINTS TO SOME VERY INTERESTING BIOLOGY IN TERMS OF HOW THE BRAIN DEVELOPS AND HOW THE BODY DEVELOPS NOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS I STEM AND BODY IS A FASCINATING AND VAST LITERATURE CERTAINLY FAR TOO VAST TO COVER IN TO DAY'S EPISODE ESPECIALLY AT THIS LATE HOUR AS IT WERE BUT WE WILL HAVE A FUTURE EPISODE ALL ABOUT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT IN TERMS OF THE EFFECTS OF CANABUS IT SUFFICIENT TO SAY THAT CANABENOIND RECEPTORS ARE PRESENT AND ACTIVE IN THE DEVELOPING FEEDUS THEY AR PRESENT AND ACTIVE IN THE NEW BORN THEY ARE PRESENT ACTIVE INADOLESCENCE AND ACROSS THAT TIME FROM CONCEPTION UNTIL ADOLESCENCS IN DOGENISTS CANAVENOIS ARE MAINLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF THOSE CONABENOID RECEPTORS DURING THAT TIME THE CANAVONOIED RECEPTORS ARE HAVING VERY SPECIFIC EFFECTS THAT ARE DISTINCT FROM THEIR EFFECTS LATER IN LIFE AND THOSE EFFECTS CAN LARGELY BE EXPLAIN INTERMS OF NURAL DEVELOPMENT AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR AN ENTIRE LECTURE ON THIS NOW BUT DURING DEVELOPMENT YOUR BODY WAS A COLLECTION OF A BUNCH OF CELLS ITS ASTUALY CALLED A BLASTULA WHICH MEANS A BALL OF CELLS AND THEN THOSE CELLS ACTUALLY HAVE TO GROW OUT CONNECTIONS AND DUPLICATE THEMSELVES AND THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING PROCESS BY WHICH NURONS INITIALLY ARE SITUATED FAR APART AND THEN THEY GROW OUT CONNECTIONS AND MAKE CONTACTS WITH ONE ANOTHER THEY REMOVE CERTAIN CONNECTIONS DEPENDING ON WILL KIND A LIFE EVENTS ARE EXPOSED TO IF YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL EVENT EARLY IN LIFE FOR A DROMATIC EARLY LIFE THOSE CONNECTIONS CHANGE ET CETERA IMPORTANT POINT FOR TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS THAT THE C B ONE RECEPTOR IN PARTICULAR IS EXPRESSED ON EVERY NURON IN THE DEVELOPING BRAIN AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE IMPORTANT FOR EVERY ASPECT OF NURAL DEVELOPMENT FROM THE PROLIFERATION OF CELLS MEANING GETTING ENOUGH CELLS TO CREATE A BRAIN TO THE OUTGROWTH OF THE SO CALLED ACCELLENS OF THE WIRES THAT CONNECT UP NURONS WITH ONE ANOTHER TO THE STEERING THE DIRECTION AT WHICH THOSE ACTS ONS GO IN DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS ESCENTIAL AND EVEN SO FAR AS TO EXPLAIN THE CONNECTIONS THAT FORMD BETWEEN NURONS THE SO CALED SYNAPSES AND THEN HOW THOSE INAPS IS WORK SO THE BASIC STATEMENT HERE IS THAT INDOGENIS CANAVENOIS AND C B ONE RECEPTOR ACTIVATION ARE CRITICAL FOR EVERY ASPECT OF BRAIN WIRING AND DEVELOPMENT WITH THAT IN MIND THE STATEMENT I AM ABOUT TO MAKE IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING AT LEAST TO ME AND FRANKLY IT SHOULD BE TERRIFYING TO YOU AS WELL AND THE STATEMENT IS THE CURRENT STATISTICS ON CANABUS USE IN PREGNANT MOTHERS IS ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING THE MOST RECENT SURVEY OF PREGNANT MOTHERS IN UNITED STATES SHOW THAT FIFTEEN PER CENT ONE FIVE FIFTEEN PER CENT OF PREGNANT MOTHERS REPORT USING CANABUS IN SOME FORM OR ANOTHER EITHER SMOKING IT OR MORE LIKELY INGESTION OF INETIBLE BECAUSE THEY ARE AWARE OF THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SMOKING ON THE DEVELOPING PEEDUS INGESTION OF AN EDIBLE TO INCREASE T H C AND OR C B D DURING PREGNANCY WHICH TO ME I HAVE TO SAY AS A DEVELOPMENAL NOROBIOLOGIST IS FRANKLY IT'S A IT'S SCARRY IT'S ABSOLULY SCARRID BECAUSE THAT C B ONE RECEPTOR IS NOT JUST OF MINOR PLAYER IN NERAL DEVELOPMENT IT IS ABSOLUTELY CENTRAL TO EVERY CRITICAL ASPECT OF BRAIN WIRING AND DEVELOPMENT NOW THE LONG TERMIMPLICATIONS OR EVEN THE SHORTCHERM IMPLICATIONS OF THIS FIFTEEN PER CENT OF MOTHERS SELF REPORTING THE USE OF CANABUS AT SOME POINT DURING PREGNANCY ARE NOT YET KNOWN THIS IS AS WOULD SAY A AN EXPERIMENT THAT'S ON GOING BUT I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T POINT OUT THESE DATA AND JUST IMPLORE YOU PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IF YOU ARE PREGNANT OR CONSIDERING GETTING PREGNANT YOUR CANABUS USER WHETHER NOT YOUUSING EDIBLES IF YOUR C B D US OR PLEASE DO WHATEVER IT IS NECESSARY TO NOT IN JEST CANABAS OR SMOKE CANABUS OR IN JS C B D DURING PREGNANCY NOW THERE MAY BE CERTAIN CLINICAL INDICATIONS BY WHICH YOUR PHYSICIAN AND YOUR OB GUAN AND YOUR THE P DI ATRICIAN THAT WILL VENTURE BE THE PETEATRICIAN FOR YOUR YOUR CHILD WILL PERSCRIBE C B D ALTHOUGH IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT THOSE ARE I CONTACTED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PEDIATRICIANS AND OB GYANS AND NOT A SINGLE ONE SAID THEY WOULD EVER SUGGESTED IN FACT WOULD STRONGLY DISCOURAGE THEIR PATIENTS FROM USING CANABAS DURING PREGNANCY BUT I THINK THAT THE ADVENT OF EDIBLE FORMS OF CANABUS AND THE COMMINATION OF T H C AND C B D AN CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND THE FACT THAT MOST PEOPLE W C B D AS SAFER BECAUSE IT DOES NOT INCLUDE AS OR DOES NOT HAVE I SHOULD SAY THE PCSYCHOLACT OF EFFECTS THAT T H C DOES HAS LED TO A SITUATION WHERE MAYHAVE FIFTEEN PER CENT OF PREGNANT MOTHERS USING CANBAS AT SOME POINT DURING PREGNANCY AND MAY BE EVEN FREQUENTLY THROUGHOUT PREGNANCY AND THE EFFECTS ON THE DEVELOPING FEETUS ARE COMPLETELY UNKNOWN BUT RECALL THAT CANABAS AND T H C AND C B D OUT COMPETE MEANING THEY PARK IN THE RECEPTOR FOR INDOGENOS CAN ABANOIS AND PREVENT ENDOGENOS CAN ABINOIDS FROM HAVING THEIR NORMAL LEVEL AND PATTERN OF ACTION SO THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL I CANNOT ENCOURAGE YOU ENOUGH OR RATHER I SHOULD AY I CANNOT DISCOURAGE ENOUGH THE USE OF CANABAS AND ANY RELATED COMPOUNDS IN CANABAS EDIBLE OR SMOKE CERTAINLY NOT SMOKED BUT EVEN EDIBLE DURING PREGNANCY AND CERTAINLY IN BREST FEDING LACTATING MOTHERS THE SAME IS ALL SUCH OU RECALL THAT CANABAUS AND T H C AND C B D ARE INCREDIBLY LIP OF PILIC THEY THEY ARE FAT SOLUBLE AND THEY GET INTO CELLS VER VERY READILY AND THEY CROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER THEY CROSS THE BLOOD PACENTAL BARRIER SO WHEN I ENCOUNTER THE STATISTIC I IHAD AGON WIPE MY EYES A FEW TIMES I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT AND YET I CROSS CHECK THAT NUMBER WITH A FEW OTHER STUDIESE A FEW OTHERS HAVE COME IN A LOBIT LOWER IT YOU KNOW SOMEWHERE LET THIRTEEN TO FOURTEEN PER CENT IF YOU HAVE COME IN ELIBIT HIGHER BUT THE AVERAGE OF FIFTEEN PER CENT IS BOTH STRIKING AND SHOCKING I DON'T KN HOW TO MAKE THE MESSAGE MORE CLEAR I HOPE THAT IS CLEAR PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY CANABAS T H C OR RELATED THINGS INCLUDING C B D SMOKED OR EDABAL IF YOURE PREGNANT LACTATING ET CETERA NOW WE ARE AT THE POINT WHERE WE NEED TO CONSIDER SOME OF THE NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS OF CANABAS THAT HAVE BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED IN PUE REVIEWED STUDIES AND BEFORE I DO THIS I WANT A RETURN TO A POINT THAT I MADE EARLIER WHICH IS THAT NOTHING I AM ABOUT TO SAY RELATES DIRECTLY TO ISSUES OF LEGALITY IF WE CONSIDER ALCOHOL FOR INSTANCE ALCHOL IS LEGAL IN MOST AREAS OF THE WORLD IT CERTAINLY LEGAL IN THE U S AND YET THERE'S AN AGE LIMIT FOR ITS USE TIPICALLY IT'S NOT AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE UNTIL THEIRE TWENTY ONE OR OLDER ITS NOT TO SAY THAT CERTAIN PEOPLE DON'T USE IT BEFORE AGE TWENTY ONE BUT ITS NOT LEGAL IT IS ILLEGAL TO BYR POSSESS ALCHOL CONSUME ALCHALL BEFORE AGE TWENTY ONE ND I THINK WITH GOOD REASON BECAUSE THE BRAIN IS STILL DEVELOPING LIKEWISE WE CAN HAVE A IN FORMED DISCUSSION ABOUT CANABAS AND ITS VARIOUS COMPONENTS THAT CAN FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE REALITY WHICH IS THAT ONE OF THE MAGER HARMS OF CANABAS IN THE PAST HAS BEEN THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS OF CANABAS BEING ILEGAL I THAT'S A STATEMENT THAT IS NO LONGER CONTROVERSIAL AND THIS IS NOT DISCUSSION ABOUT LEGALIZATION OR NON LEGALIZATION IF YOU LOOK TO THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE THE EPIDEMIULOGICAL LITERATURE THERE ARE WONDERFUL DATA OUT OF CARLTON UNIVERSITY AND ELSEWHERE IN CANADA SHOWING THAT MANY OF THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF MAROANA AND T H C ARE DUE TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ITSELF THAT IS THE CREATION OF ILLICIT DRUG BUSINESSES THE CREATION OF ORGANIZE CRIME THE CREATION OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FEATURES RELATED TO THE ILLEGALITY OF CANABAS AND AGAIN THIS IS IN THE TOPIC OF TO DAY'S EPISODE BUT THAT SHOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGED AND AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHEND A COMPOUND A DRUG OR WHATEVERY ONE TO CALL IT BECOMES LEGAL THERE IS A TENDENCY TO ASSUME THAT ITS SAFE AND SAFE FOR EVERYBODY AND WITH RESPECT TO CANABAS AND T H C AND PERHAPS EVEN C B D BUT CERTAINLY FOR T H C AND CANABAS THAT SMOKED OR VAPED OR CONSUMED INEDIBLE FORM THAT IS SIMPLY NOT THE CASE THERE ARE CLEAR DATA POINTING TO NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS OF CANABAS USEINT H C S WHICH AGAIN IS NOT TO SAY THAT THERE ARE NOT POSIVE EFFECTS ON MOOD ANXIETY PAIN RELIEF ET CETERA THOSE ARE OUT THERE AND THEY EXIST AND WE WILL MENTION SOME OF THOSE OF COURSE AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THOSE CREATIVITY FOR INSTANCE ET CETERA BUT IF WE DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS THAT ARE DOCUMENTED IN THE LITERATURE THEN WE ARE OVERLOOKING SOME VERY IMPORTANT DATA ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PSYCHOSIS IN CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS SO WITH THAT SAID THERE ARE VERY STRONG DATA AND I WILL PROVIDE LINKS TO THESE RESOURCES POINTING TO THE FACT THAT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE CHRONIC USERS OF CANABAS THAT IS USING IT TWICE A WEEK OR MORE THAT OVER TIME THEIR LEVELS OF ANXIETY ACTUALLY INCREASE AND THIS IS TRUE EVEN FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE USING STRAINS OF CANABAS THAT WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CANABAS REDUCE ANXIETY OVER TIME MEANING OVER THE COURSE OF TWELVE OR MORE MONTHS THERE IS A WELL DOCUMENTED EFFECT OF THE ANXIETY RELIEF THAT CANABAS AND T  INITIALLY BROUGHT BEING LESS AND LESS POTENT THAT IS PEOPLE NEED TO SMOKE MORE OF IT OR IN GJEST MORE T H S IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE SAME LEVEL OF ANXIETY RELIEF AND IN SOME CASES A SWITCH FROM ANXIETY RELIEF TO INCREASE IN ANXIETY AND AGAIN THAT'S INCREASE IN ANXIETY NOT JUST WHEN THE DRUG IS NOT BEING CONSUMED BUT ALSO WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE DRUG WHY WOULD THAT BE WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE S B ONE RECEPTR AND THE POTENCY WITH WHICH T C BINDS TO THAT C B ONE RECEPTR WHEN TC IS BROUGHT INTO THE SYSTEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN MEANING TWICE A WEEK OR MORE THE BINDING OF TC THAT C B ONE RECEPTR AVENTUALLY CAUSES A SORT OF HABITUATION OR ATTENUATION OF THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF BINDING THE RECEPTOR IN CREATING THE PSYCHOACT OF EFFECTS SO INITIALLY IT CREATES ANXIETY RELIEF BUT OVER TIME THE AFFINITY FOR THE RECEPTOR DOESN'T CHANGE MEANING CAN STILL PARKEN THAT SLOT WITH A LOT OF AFFINNY A LOT OF STRENGTH BUT THERE ARE FEWR FEWER RECEPTORS AVAILABLE AND THAN THE SIGNALLING THAT'S DOWN STREAM OF THOSE RECEPTORS BECOMES LESS AND LESS ROBOST NOW THIS IS A TOPIC WE DIDN'T GET INTO IN TOO MUCH DETAIL TO DAY BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANE INCLUDE EVEN MORE BIOLOGICAL DETAIL BUT THE S B ONE RECEPTOR IS A SO CALLED G PROTINE COUPLED RECEPTOR IT THAT'S A MOUTHFUL BUT A G PROTING COUPLED RECEPTOR BASICALLY IS LIKE A BUCKET BRIGADE SO WHILE SOME RECEPTORS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY ARE CSUCH THAT WHEN SOMETHING A CHEMICAL BINDS TO THEM THAT RECEPTOR HAS A DIRECT ACTION LIKE IT OPENS AND ALLOW STUFFED A RUSSIAN TO THE CELL INCREASES THE EXCITABILITY OF THE CELL SO CALLED FAST EFFECTS THESE G PROTINE COUPLED RECEPTORS AND S B ONE IS A G PROTING COUPLED RECEPTR THEY ARE MORE LIKE A BUCKET BRIGADE WHERE THEY KICK OFF A PROCESS THROUGH ONE MOLECULE THATHAN IS HANDED OFF TO ANOTHER MOLECULE THAT T THEN IS HANDED OFF TO ANOTHER MOLECULE IT'S A LONG CHAIN OR CASCADE OF EVENTS THOSE LONG CHAINS OR CASCADES OF EVENTS HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR REGULATION FOR ADJUSTMENT YOU RECEPTOR SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY ESPECIALY RECEPTOR SYSTEMS LIKE THE CANABONOID SYSTEM THAT ARE USED TO BENG CAN HAVE TICKLED NOT PUNCHED YOU KNOW TICKLED BY NDOGINISTS CANABONOIDS EVERYONE SN WHILE SOME BINDS HAS AN ECECT BUT CERTAINLY NOT BOUND WITH INCREDIBLE P OTENCY AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AS THEY ARE WHEN T C IS COMING INTO THE SYSTEM WELL THOSE SYSTEMS OF ENTYOVER TIME THEY ADJUST THEMSELVES SO THAT THE BODY AND THOSE CELLS CAN ACHIEVE SO CALLED HOMEOSTASIS SO WHEN PEOPLE ARE USING T C MORE THAN TWICE A WEEK WHAT ENDS OF HAPPENING IS THOSE GEPROTING COUPLED RECEPTORS IN THE DOWNSTREAM SIGNALING MECHANISMS START TO ADJUST THEMSELVES AND IT REQUIRES MORE AND MORE DRUG SO EITHER HIER DOSAGES ORE MORE FREQUENT USE AND A LOT OF THE POSITIVE EFFECTS THE SO CALLED DECREASE IN ANXIETY INCREASE FOCUS INCREASE CREATIVITY SOME OF THAT STARTS TO WAIN IT STARTS TO DISSIPATE AND PEOPLE WONDER WHY THEY HAVE TO USE SO MUCH CANABAS JUST TO ACHIEVE A FRACTION OF THE EFFECT THAT THEY USE TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE WITH EVEN A LOWER DOSE SO ANXIETY IS GETTING WORSE OVER TIME AND THAT'S ANXIETY DURING THE DRUG USE AND OUTSIDE OF THE DRUG USE SOME PEOPLE WORK AROUND THAT OR TRY TO WORK AROUND THAT BY USING VARYING STRAINS OF CANABAS OR CHANGING THE PATTERN OF DELIVERY FROM OU KNOW SMOKING TO VAPING OR FROM VAPING TO EDIBLE AND FROM EDIBLES ITRID TRANSTERNAL ANYWAY THEY GO THROUGH A LOT OF GYMNASTICS IN WRITHING AND AM SEEKING BUT NONE THE LESS ANXIETY INCREASES OVER TIME ALSO IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT DEPRESSION INCREASES OVER TIME AND ESPECIALLY THIS IS SURPRISING TO ME BUT ESPECIALLY FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE NOT DEPRESSED AT THE OUTSET OF THEIR USE INOTHERWAS THEY DIDN START USING CANABATS BECAUSE THEY WERE DEPRESSED BUT RATHER THE DEPRESSION STARTS TO EMERGE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE CANABAS AND T  USE SO THATS SERIOUS IN FACT WE NOW KNOW BASED ON REALLY SOLID EPIDEMIALOGICAL EVIDENCE THAT DEPRESSION IS NOT A STRONG PREDICTOR OF SEEKING OUT CANABAS IT DOESN'T DRIVE TERRIBLY MANY PEOPLE TO SEEK OUT CANABAS USE BUT CANABAS USE ITSELF MAKES PEOPLE FOUR TIMES LIKELIER TO DEVELOP A CHRONIC MAJOR DEPRESSION SO ANXIETY IS INCREASING DEPRESSION IS INCREASING AND THIS TURNS OUT TO BE ESPECIALLY RELEVANT IMPORTANT TO YOUNG PEOPLE WHY DO I SAY THAT WELL IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA AND AGAIN I THINK SOME OF THE STRONGEST DATA OR DATA TO COME OUT OF THE CANADIAN SYSTEM THEY'VE DONE SOME REALLY BEAUTIFUL CONTROLLED STUDIES I REALLY HOPE TO INVITE SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO RANGED AND RAN THOSE STUDIES AS GESS ON TO THE HUBERMEN THAT POTCAST BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA OUT OF CANADA RE  LOOK AT SOME OF THE DATA OUT OF NORTHERN EUROPE IN THE US WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT THE PROBABILITY THAT SOMEBODY WILL USE CANABAS AND THEN GO ON TO USE IT CRAM CHRONICALLY CORLAS VERY STRONGLY WITH AGE SO FOR INSTANCE SOME OF THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF CANABAS USE IS AMONG INDIVIDUALS SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR FOUR YEARS OLD IN FACT IN INDIVIDUALS FROR SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD AND IN PARTICULAR IN STUDENTS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING SURPRISING MORE THAN IN UNEMPLOYED POPULATIONS BEING YOUNG SIXTEEN TO TW NTY FOR AT LEAST TO ME THAT'S YOUNG AND BEING A STUDENT OR WORKING DOUBLES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT SOMEBODY IS GOING TO USE CANABAUS ON A REGULAR BASIS TWICE OR MORE PER WEEK THE TYPICAL AGE OF INITIATING CANABUTS USES NOWDAYS IS ABOUT NINETEEN YEARS OLD SO EIGHTEEN POINT SEVEN AND ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE IN THAT AGE BRACKET OF SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD ARE USING CANABUS DAILY EITHER BY VAPING BY SMOKING OR BY EDIBLE THAT'S AN ENORMOUS NUMBER AT LEAST BY MY RED IT'S ENORMOUS NUMBER AND HEARE'S WHY IT'S OF REALLY SERIOUS CONCERN DURING THE AGES OF SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR THE CANABINOID RECEPTORS ARE STILL AVAILABLE THEY ARE NOT BEING AS STRONGLY DRIVEN BY INDOGONISTS CANABINOIDS BUT BY INGESTION OF T H C AND OR C B D THERE ARE DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS ON THE SIGNALLING WITHIN THOSE CELVS THAT ALL THE DATA POINT TO CREATING A MUCH MUCH HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF DEVELOPING MAJOR DEPRESSION SEVERE ANXIETY OR PSYCHOSIS AT LATER AGES SO TO BE VERY CLEAR CANABAS USE BETWEEN THE AGES OF SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES IS INCREASING ANXIETY INCREASEN DEPRESSION IN THE IMMEDIATE YEARS AND WITHIN THE ONE YEAR'S TIME OR SO SO MUCH SO THAT PEOPLE ARE USING CANABAUS ON GOING IT IN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE THAT ANXIETY AND REDUCE THAT DEPRESSION BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT THE CANABUS USE AND BECAUSE OF THE SIGNALLING MECHANISMS INVOLVED ARE PREDISPOSING THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO PSYCHOSIS LATER IN LIFE IF YOU LOOK AT INDIVIDUALS WHO START USING CANABUSTS EVEN YOUNGER GE FOURTEEN OR EVEN AS YOUNG AS TWELVE THE PROBABILITY OF PSYCHOSISTS LATER IN LIFE IN PARTICULAR SCIS A FRENTIC OR SIS A FRENTIC LIKE EPISODES MORE THAN DOUBLES SO THIS IS OF REALLY SERIOUS CONCERN AND THIS IS COMPLETELY ASIDE FROM ANY SO CALLED POSIVE EFFECTS OUR BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF CANABUSTS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT DERIVE FROM OCCASIONALLY USE AS ADULTS MEANING PEOPLE OLDER THAN TWENTY FIVE SO FOR THE PERSON WHOS OLDER THAN TWENTY FIVE WHO YOU KNOW EATS ANETABLE EVERY ONES IN WHILE OR WHO SMOKES CANABUSTS EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE LOVE TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT YU NOITES NOT AS BAD AS ALCOHOLE AT WHICH I FRANKLY AS HE TERRIBLE ARGUMENT BECAUSE IF YOUS ARE EPISODE A ALCALL ALCALLS PRETTY BAD A BUT EVEN SO IT'S JUST NOT A GOOD ARGUMENT THAT YOU KNOW SAYING THAT SOMETHING IS GOOD BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS BAD IS SOMETHING ELSE IS SIMPLY JUST NOT A GOOD OR VALID ARGUMENT LYST NOT BIOLOGICALLY SPEAKING A THE USE OF CANABAUS IN YOUNG POPULATIONS IS VERY STRONGLY PREDISPOSING PEOPLE TO PSYCHOTIC EPISODES AND WE KNOW THE MECHANISM BY WHICH THIS OCCURS THIS IS OCCURS BY A THINNING OF THE SO CALL GRAY MATTER AND IT'S CALLED GRAY MATTER BECAUSE WITH NURONS NERVE CELLS THEY HAVE A SO CALLED SELL BODY THAT'S THE PART THAT CONTAINS THE DNAY AND MANUFACTURES ALL THE NARROW TRANSMITTERS ET CETERA AND THOSE ERE SHIPPED OUT TO THE OTHER PARTS OF THE NARAN THAN INCLUDE THE ACTS ON THE WIRES BETWEEN ACTS ONS AND THOTACTS ONS UNDER THE MICROSCOPE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT OF FATTY TISSUE AROUND THEM AND THIS IS HEALTHY FATTY TISSUE THAT ALLOWS ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION TO BE FAST THAT FATTY TISSUE THOUGH THOSE PORTIONS OF THE CELLS ARE CALLED WHITE MATTER SEE OF GRAY MATTER AND WHITE MATTER GRAY MATTER OF THE SO CALLE CELL BODIES WHERE THE DEONAE AND ALL THE STUFF IS MANUFACTURED WHITE MATTER OR THE SORT OF THE ACTS ONS TO THE WIRES THROUGH WICH ALL THE KEY COMPONENTS ARE SHIPPED OUT TO THE SYNNAPS ET CETERA WONDERFUL DATA AND I DO SAY WONDERFUL BECAUSE ITS PART OF A LARGE SCALE CONSORTIUM AND WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THE PAPER THIS IS PUBLISHIN TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY JUST THIS YEAR POINT TO THE FACT THAT ADOLESCENT CANABUSTS USE ECCELERATES THE THINNING OF THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX AND THE GRAY MATTER IN PARTICULARS SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS WHILE DURING NORMAL DEVELOPMENT THE GRAY MATTER THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX IN ALL THE CELLS THERE ARE INDEED INTENDED IT'S A NORMAL PROCESS FOR IT TO THICKEN AND THEN THIN A LITTLE BIT AS CONNECTIONS ARE ADJUSTED AND PEOPLE LEARN AND MATURE AND GROW UP THIS IS PART OF THE NORMAL HEALTHY MATURATIONAL PROCESS INDEPENDENT CANABUS USE WHEN KIDS CAUSE THESE REALLY ARE KIDS USE CANABAS IN IT DOESN'T MATTER THE MODE OF CANABUS DELIVERY WHETHER NOT ITS VAPING OR SMOKING OR EDABAL THAT GRAY MATTER THINS AT A MUCH MUCH GREATER RATE AND THE REASON I LIKE THIS PAPER PUBLISHIN TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY THIS YEAR SO MUCH IS THAT THEY LINK THE AMOUNT OF CANABUS USE HEAVY MODERATE LIGHT OR NO CANABUS USE TO THE RATE OF PREFRONTAL QUARTICAL THINNING AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR FROM THESE DATA THAT THE MORE OFTEN YOUNG PEOPLE MEANING INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN THE AGE OF FOURTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE THE MORE OFTEN THEY CONSUME OR SMOKE OR VAPE CANABUS THE FASTER AND THE MORE EXTREME THAT QUARTICAL THINING IS AND THE CORTICAL THINNING IS INCURRING IN EXACTLY THEY AREY OF THE BRAIN THAT'S INVOLVED IN PLANNING IN CONTROL OVER ONE'S EMOTIONS IN REFLECTES IN ORGANIZING ONE'S LIFE IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS ANYWHERE FROM CLEANING ONE'S ROOM LITERALLY YOU KOW KNOWING WHAT GOES WERE TO MAKING PLANS THAT EXTEND OUT THROUGH THE DAY THROUGH THE WEEK THROUGH A YEAR ESSENTIALLY BECOMING A FUNCTIONAL HUMAN BEING INVOLVES USING YOUR PREFRONTAL QUARTEX IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CONTECT AND DIFFERENT S FOR OF TIME DOMAINS THE TIME DOMAIN OF AN HOUR THE TIME DOMAIN OF A DAY MAKING PLANS IN BEING ABLE TO EXECUTE PLANS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO BEING A HEALTHY HUMAN BEING AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR FROM THESE DATA THAT THE MORE CANABUSTS ONE USES THE MORE IMPAIRED THOSE NORAL CIRCUITS ARE AR SIMPLY NO OTHER WAY TO TO VIEW THESE DATA IN FACT SO MUCH SO THAT EVEN SMALL AMOUNTS OF CANABUS USE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH RATES OF CORTICAL THINNING IN DEGREES OF QUARTICAL THINING THAT ARE REALLY DETRIMENTAL AND CONCERNING FOR NORMAL COGNATIVE PROCESSES IF YOU WERE SOMEBODY WHO SMOKED MARIANA OR CONSOON CANABS IN ANY FORMR ANOTHER DURING A ILESCENCE DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOUR PREFENTIAL QUARTECS CAN NEVER BE RESCUED THAT IT CAN'T COME BACK THE SHORT ANSWER IS IT PROBABLY CAN BE RESCUED TO SOME DEGREE IT WILL DEPEND ON HOW MUCH CANABAS YOU WERE USING AND HOW OFTEN AND WHAT STRAINS OF CANABAS ET CETERA THERE'S REALLY NO TRAVELLING BACK IN TIME AS MY GRADURVAZARE USED TO SAY YO TIME MACHINES ARE BROKEN LEAST FOR NOW WE DON'T HAVE TIME MACHINE SO ALL YOU CAN REALLY DO IS TRYING EMPHASIZE FOR SOME ALL QUITTING CANABAS IN ANY FORM AND FOCUSING ON BEHAVIORS THAT EMPHASIZE ENDO THEALLIAL SELL BLOOD FLOW HEALTH TO THE BRAIN SO THAT WOULD BE CARDYOVASCULAR EXERCISE ADEQUATE NUTRITION NOT SMOKING NICOTINE AND THERE ARE NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS THAT ONE CAN DO WE WILL DO AN ENTIRE EPISODE ALL ABOUT TRYING TO REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF CANABAS AND OTHER DRUG USED DURING ADOLESCENCE WE MOITHAVE TIME TO DO A DEEP DIVE ON THAT RIGHT NOW BUT ALL THE THINGS THAT STANDARDIZE AND KIND OF PROMOTE HEALTH ADEQUATE SLEEP A GOOD SOCIAL CONNECTION REGULAR CARDIOVASCULAR AND WIT TRAINING EXERCISE HEALTHY NUTRITION WHAT THAT REPRESENTS YOU HEALTHY METABOLIC FUNCTION AND WAIHT ET CETERA THOSE ARE ALL GOING TO FACILITATE SOME RECOVERY OF BRAIN FUNCTION IN PARTICULAR PREFRUNTAL CUORTICAL FUNCTION BY WAY OF ALL THE POSIVE EFFECTS AT THOSE BEHAVIORS AND CHOICES HAVE BUT WITH THAT SAID IF YOU ARE IN THE AGE BRACKET THAT I'VE BEEN REFERRING TO THIS FOURTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YOROLD AGE BRACKET AND YOU ARE A OCCASIONAL EVEN OR CHRONIC CANABUS USAR YOU SHOULD BE VERY VERY CAREFUL AND CONCERN ABOUT THE LONG TERM EFFECTS THAT POTENTIALLY HAVE THAT STATEMENT IS BOLSTERED BY ANOTHER STITISTIC WHICH IS THAT UNLIKE A LOT OF OTHER DRUGS THE RATE OF CANABAS USE IS STRONGLY RELATED TO HOW DANGEROUS PEOPLE PERCEIVE CANABAS TO BE THAT MIGHT SEEM OBVIOUS ON THE ONE HAND YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK SOMETHING IS VERY VERY DANGEROUS YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT THE PROBABILITY THAT SOMEBODY WOULD USE IT WOULD BE VERY VERY LOW AND IF THEY THINK SOMETHING IS SAFE THE PROBABILITY WOULD BE HIGH BUT THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY THE CASE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT CANABAS IS A UNIQUE INSTANCE IN WHICH NOWADAYS WE ARE HEARING YES IT'S BECOMING LEGAL IN A UMBER OF AREAS AND WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT WHY THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING IN MOST CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THAT WE AREN'T JUST HEARING THAT CANABAS IS SAFE OR IT'S NOT JOUST BEING IMPLIED THAT CANABUS IS SAFEFER BUT MANY MORE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF CANABAS WITHOUT A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CANABAS AND I REALIZE THAT SAYING THIS IS GOING TO UPSET SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO FOUGHT VERY HARD FOR THE LEGALIZATION PROCESS AND OUR WANT OF KNOWLEDGE THAT I ALSO WONT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE MANY KNOWN POSITIVE EFFECTS OF CANABAS IN ADULTS WITH VERY OCCASIONAL USE PROVIDED IT IS DELIVERED SAFELY AND IN THE SAFE CONTECT AND SETTING AND WITH LEGALITY THAT IS ENTIRELY DISTINCT FROM THE ISSUE OF WEATHER NOT CANABUS IS SAFE FOR THE DEVELOPING BRAIN AND BODY AGAIN I'M NOT DEMONIZING ANYBODY FOR USING CANABUS BUT I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT VERY SIMPLY AND VERY DIRECTLY IT IS FAR AND AWAY A DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCE FOR THE BRAIN FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO BE TWENTY FIVE YEARS OR OLDER AND USING CANABUS IN WHATEVER FORM OCCASIONALLY OR MAYBE EVEN FREQUENTLY THEN IT IS FOR A YOUNG PERSON AGED FOURTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE TO BE USING CANABUS EITHER BY SMOKING OR VAPING OR BY EDIBLE OR ANY OTHER FORM ON THE BRAIN AND BODY IT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT THE BRAIN CONTINUES TO DEVELOP AT LEAST UNTIL AGED TWENTY FIVE AND THAT A HUGE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS RELATED TO MOOD REGULATION SO CALLED EXECUTIVE FUNCTION THE ABILITY TO ORGANIZE ONE'S THOUGHTS PLAN AND EXECUTE PLANS SUMECILY TO BE COM A FUNCTIONAL HUMAN BEING THAT'S ONE PORTION OF BECOMING A FUNCTIONAL HUMAN BEING BUT CERTAINLY I AN ESSENTIAL ONE ALL OF THAT RELIES ON THE FINE TUNING OF THIS NERAL CIRCUITRY THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT UP UNTIL NOW AND IT'S ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THET CANABUS AND T C IN PARTICULAR DRAMATICALLY DISERRUPT THOSE PROCESSES SO IF THIS IS EN CLEAR ENOUGH JUST FROM MY STATEMENTS I LIKE TO POINT TO OF PARTICULAR PAPER THIS IS ONE OF THE MORE IMPACTFUL PAPERS IN THIS AREAN RECENT YEARS SOS HA PAPER PUBLISHED IN LANCIT PSYCHIOTRY IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO TITLE IS ASSOCIATION OF CANABUS POTENCY WITH MENTAL ILL HEALTH IN ADDICTION A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW TERE NUMBER OF VERY IMPORTANT POINTS IN THIS VERY FINE PAPER LENTS IT PSYCHIATRY IS ONE OF THE PERMEAR MEDICAL JOURNALS OUT THERE AND THEY AVALUATED A HUGE NUMBER OF STUDIES THEY USHY LOOKED AT MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND STUDIES THEY SELECTED THE ONES THAT WERE ONLY THE MOST RIGOROUS AND TERMS OF STUDY DESIGN AND ANALYSIS AND RIGOR OF CONCLUSIONS AND THEY LOOKED AT HOW EARLY USE OF CANABAS IMPACTED LATER PROBABILITY OF DEVELOPMENT OF PSYCHOSIS AND OTHER PSYCHEATRIC CONDITIONS AND THE TICWAYS FROM THIS STUDY ARE VERY CLEAR FIRST OF ALL CHRONIC CANABUS USE SO MORE THAN TWICE PER WEEK HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS AN PULLING SOME PHRASES DIRECTLY FROM THE PAPER HEAVY CANABUS USE MEANING CANABAUS USE MORE FREQUENT THAN TWICE PER WEEK HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH FOUR TIMES THE RISK OF PSYCHOSIS LATER IN LIFE IN PARTICULAR SKITZOPHRENIA AND BY POLAR LIKE EPISODES NOW WE'VE DONE AN EPISODE ON BY POLAR DISORDER SOCLE BY POLAR DEPRESSION WE HAVE NOT YET DONE ONE ON SKIS OPHRENIA BUT BOTH BY POLAR DISORDER AND SCHISIFHRENIA HAVE A VERY VERY STRONGTIONETIC COMPONENT THERE IS A THIRTY THREE ZERO THIRTY TIMES GREATER LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU HAVE BY POLAR DISORDER IF YOU HAVE A FIRST RELAT IV AS BY POLAR DISORDER AND THEN IT'S ALSO THE CASE THAT USING CANABAS ESPECIALLY DURING ADOLESCENCE AND THE TEEN YEARS AND UP UNTIL AGE TWENTY FIVE CREATE A FOUR TIMES GREATER RISK OF PCYCHOSIS FOR THOSE THAT HAVE A PREDISPOSITION TO BY POLAR DISORDER AND OR SKIS APHRENIA NOW I DON'T HERE VERY MUCH ABOUT THIS IN THE MEDIA THIS PAPER GOT SOME ATTENTION AND THEN ITSORT OF A GOT SWEPT AWAY I DON'T THINK THAT WAS AN INTENTIONAL SWEEPING WAY THERS JUST A LOT OF EVENTS IN THE WORLD AS YOU A WELL KNOWN BUT I THINK IT'S A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT SET OF FINDINGS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT IN LOOKING AT SO MANY STUDIES IT DISTILLS OUT THE STRONGEST FINDINGS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND REALLY PULLS THE THE THE CONSISTENT MESSAGES THAT DERIVING FROM ALL THESE DIFFERENT STUDIES AND AS THEY POINT OUT AND AGAIN I'M PARAPHRASING HERE THIS IS THE FIRST SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CANABAS POTENCY AND ALL OF THE DAT A POINT TO A VERY CLEAR CONCLUSION WHICH IS THE MORE POTENT THE T C CONCENTRATION THE HIGHER PROBABILITY OF DEVELOPING SYCHOSIS OR A MAJOR DEPRESS OF EPISODE OR A MAJOR ANXIETY DISORDER LATER IN LIFE THAT SHOULD BE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN BECAUSES WE KNOW WE ARE ABSOLUTECLEAR ABOUT THE FACT THAT WITH THE ADVENT OF ALL THESE NEW STRAINS OF CANABAS AND WITH THE ENGINEERING AND AVAILABILITY OF CANABAS AT MUCH HIGHER POTENCY MEANING T C POTENCY THE RISK OF PSYCHOSIS IS GOING UP AND UP AND IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE GOING UP UNLESS SOMETHING IS DONE TO REDUCE THE FREQUENCY OF CANABAS USE TO ZERO IDEALLY OR TO VERY LOW FREQUENCY VERY LOW POTENCY IN ADOLESCENCE AND TEENS AN PEOPLE AGE TWENTY FIVE OR YOUNGER I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS MESSAGE BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL IT'S ALARMING AND SECOND OF ALL AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE STATISTICS TELL US THAT THE GREATEST NUMBER PEOPLE THAT ARE STARTING TO USE CANABATS ARE IN THE AGE BRACKET OF SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MANY OF THEM ARE FUNCTIONAL AN OTHER AIRS OF LIFE THEIR STUDENTS THEY ARE EMPLOYED ET CETERA BUT WHEN YOU COUPLE THAT WITH THE FACT THAT THE MOST FREQUENT ADOPTORS OF CANABUS USE ARE IN THIS AGE BRACKET OF SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR THEIR TWICE IS LIKELY TO USE AS OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR TO START USING CANABAS AS ARE OTHER INDIVIDUALS PLUS THE GENERAL PERCEPTION OUT THERE BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT CANABAS IS DISCUSSED IN THE MEDIA AND BY SPORTS FIGURES AND BY CELEBRITIES AND BY BY POLITICIANS ET CETERA THAT IT'S NOT AS BAD AS ALCOHOL AND MAY BE NOT THAT BAD AND MAY BE EVEN HAS HEALTH BENEFITS THEN YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY SETTING UP A SYSTEM WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO ADOPT AND CONTINUE CANABAS USE WITHOUT REALIZING THESE SERIOUS HEALTH CONSEQUENCES THAT AWAIT THEM LATER WITH ALL OF THAT SAID I OF COURSE AGAIN WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY ARE AV BEEN WELL DEMONSTRATED EFFACTS OF CANABAS FOR REDUCING PAIN IN PARTICULAR IN CEMOTHERAPY AND IN THE CONTECT OF REDUCING NAUSIA IN PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM CANS ORACHEMOTHERAPY THERE IS A WELL KNOWN EFFECT THAT ONE CAN GENERALLY POINT TO AS POSITIVE USING CANABUSTS FOR THINGS LIKE LAUCOMA FOR LOWERING INTROCULAR PRESSURE AND OFFSETTING THE LOSS OF NURONS THAT WOULD LEAD TO BLINDNESS ALTHOUGH THERE ARE OTHER TOOLS OF COURSE THET DONT EVOLVE CANABUS USE THAT CAN ACCOMPLISH THAT AS WELL SO CALLED INTROCULAR PRESSURE LOWERING DRUGS AND DROPS THERE ARE IS A LIST OF PROBABLY A DOZEN OR MORE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BODILY AILMENTS THAT CAN BE AIDED BY CANABUS USE IN PARTICULAR EDIBLE CANABUS USE OF PARTICULAR STRAINS I OF COURSE AM GOING TO A DRESS EACH IN EVERY ONE OF THOSE INEPISODES WHERE I'M TALKING FOR INSTANCE ABOUT I DISEASE OR ABOUT CHRONIC PAIN I M IN NO WAY SHAPER FORM TRYING TO ROB THE INCREDIBLE EFFORTS OF THE LABORATORIES AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE WORKS VERY HARD TO STUDY AND ESTABLISH THE VALID USES OF CANABUS FOR TREATING VARIOUS ALMENTS AND THAT CONTINUE TO STUDY CANABUS IN ORDER TO TRY IN AMELIORATE THE SYMPTOMS OF DIFFERENT AILMENTS BUT TODAY I REALLY WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THE BIOLOGY OF CANABUS SOME OF THE OFTEN DISCUSS EFFECTS I GESS ONE COULD CAL THEM POSIV EFFECTS THINGS LIKE CAN HANTS CREATIVITY AND REALLY POINT TO THE NEUAUNTS AND ACTUALLY THE DIVERGENCS OF PEOPLE WHO TAKE CANBUS AND SOME EXPERIENCE HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF CREATIVITY AND SOME DO NOT SOME PEOPLE EXPERIENCE HIGHTN LEVELS OF PSECUAL ROUSAL AND SOME PEOPLE EXPERIENCE THE EXACT OPPOSITE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH RATHER THAN FOCUS ON ALL THE PATENTIAL POSITIVE AND SORT OF EMERGING POSITIVE DATA ABOUT CANABUS INDIFFERENT MEDICAL CONTECTS AND AT THE SAME TIME I STRONGLY FEEL THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SHOCKING BECAUS THERE'S REALLY NO OTHER WAY TO DESCRIBE IT THE SHOCKING EFFECTS OF CANABUS USE ON THE DEVELOPING FEEDUS AND THE FACT THAT SO MANY PREGNANT AND LACTATING MOTHERS ARE USING CANABAS AN THAT NUMBER FIFTEEN PER CENT STILL HAS ME IN DIZZY WITH KIND OF DISBELIEF AND YET WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS AND ADDRESS THIS IMMEDIATELY AND I THINK IT'S VITAL TO UNDERSTAND THAT CANABUS USE THROUGH ANY DELIVERY MECHANISM SMOKING OR VAPING OR EDIBLE OR OTHERWISE IS VERY VERY CONCERNING IN FACT DANGEROUS TO THE DEVELOPING BRAIN CERTAINLY FOR THE FEEDAL BRAIN IN FOR THE BABY BRAIN BUT ALSO FOR THE ADOLESCENT BRAIN AND FOR THE TEEN AND YOUNG ADULT BRAIN NOTJOUS BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS THAT CAN HAVE IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM THOSE SLOW CREEPING INCREASES IN ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION BROUD ON BY CANABUS USE BUT ALSO THE TIME RELEASE IF YOU WILL ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF PSYCHOSIS AND OTHER TYPES OF MAJOR PSYCHEATRIC DISORDERS LATER IN LIFE I ACKNOWLEDGE WE'VE COVERED A LOT OF GROUND TO DAY AND YET THERE STILL FARM MORE GROUND THAT WE COULD HAVE COVERED AND THAT WE WILL INDEED COVER IN FUTURE

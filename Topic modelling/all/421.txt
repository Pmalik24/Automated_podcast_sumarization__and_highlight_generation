WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANLAPONCES  OF SCIENCE SCIENCE PAY TO E FOR  I M INTER HUBERMEN AND O OU PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TODAY MY GUEST IS DOCTOR GENA PO DOCTOR GENA POE IS A PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF INEGRATED BIOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOSS ANGELISTS HER LABORATORY AN RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SLEEP AND LEARNING IN PARTICULAR HOW SPECIFIC PATTERNS OF BRAIN ACTIVITY THAT ARE PRESENT DURING SPECIFIC PHASES OF SLEEP IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO LEARN AND REMEMBER SPECIFIC TYPES OF INFORMATION FOR INSTANCE PRECEDUAL INFORMATION THAT IS HOW TO PERFORM SPECIFIC COGNATIVE OR PHYSICAL TASKS AS WELL AS IN CODING OF EMOTIONAL MEMORIES AND DISCARDING EMOTIONAL MEMORIES INDEED HER RESEARCH FOCUSES ON HOW SPECIFIC PHASES OF SLEEP CAN ACT AS ITS OWN FORM OF TROMATH THERE BE DISCARDING THE EMOTIONAL TONES OF MEMORIES IN ADDITION HER LABORATORY FOCUSES ON HOW SPECIFIC PHASES OF SLEEP IMPACT THINGS LIKE THE RELEASE OF GROWTH HORMON GROWTHORMON OF COURSE PLAYS CRITICAL ROLLS IN METABOLISM AND TISSUE REPAIR INCLUDING BRAIN TISSUE REPAIR AND THEREFORE HAS CRITICAL ROLLS IN VITALITY AND LONGEVITY TODAY YOU WILL LEARN MANY THINGS ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SLEEP LEARNING EMOTIONALITY AND GROWTHORMON ONE BASIC BUT VERY IMPORTANT TAKE AWAY THAT YOU'LL LEARN ABOUT TO DAY WHICH WAS NEWS TO ME IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE DURATION AND DEPTH OF YOUR SLEEP THAT MATTER BUT ACTUALLY GETTING TO SLEEP AT RELATIVELY THE SAME TIME EACH NIGHT INSURES THAT YOU GET ADEQUATE GROWTHORMON RELEASE IN THE FIRST HOURS OF SLEEP IN FACT IF YOU REQUIRE LET SAY EIGHT HOURS OF SLEEP PERNIGHT BUT YOU GO TO SLEEP TWO HOURS LATER THAN YOUR TYPICAL BEDTIME ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT YOU ACTUALLY MISS THE WINDOW FOR GROWTHORMON RELEASE THAT'S RIGHT GETTING GROWTHOMON RELEASE IN SLEEP WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONGTURM HEALTH IS NOT A PREREQUISITE OF GETTING SLEEP EVEN IF WE ARE GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP AS DOCTOR PO EXPLAINS THEIR CRITICAL BRAIN CIRCUITS AND INDIGRANE THAT IS HORMON CIRCUITS THAT REGULATE NOT JUST THE DURATION AND DEPTHS AND QUALITY IN TIMING OF SLEEP BUT WHEN WE PLACE ARE BOUT OF SLEEP THAT IS WHEN WE GO TO SLEEP EACH NIGHT PLESSERMINE IS ABOUT A HALF HOUR OR SO STRONGLY DICTATES WEATHER NOT WE WILL EXPERIENCE ALL THE HEALTH PROMOTING INCLUDING MIND PROMOTING BENEFITS OF SLEEP TODAY'S EPISODE COVERS THAT AND A LOT MORE IN SUBSTANTIAL DETAIL YOU WIL LEARN FOR INCENCE HOW TO USE SLEEP IN ORDER TO OPTOMIZE LEARNING AS WELL AS FORGETTING FOR THOSE THINGS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO FORGET SO DURING TODAY'S EPISODE DOCTOR GENOPO SHARES CRITICAL INFORMATION ABOUT NOT JUST NEURO SCIENCE BUT PHYSIOLOGY AND THE HORMON SYSTEMS OF THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT STRONGLY INFORM MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE SO BY THE END OF TO DAY'S EPISODE YOU WILL BE FAR MORE INFORMED ABOUT SLEEP AND HOW IT WORKS THE DIFFERENT ROLLS IT PERFORMS AND YOU WILL HAVE SEVERAL NEW ACTIONABLE STEPS THAT YOU CAN TAKE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE YOUR MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARTH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AN EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTOC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S POTCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTOROLIKE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLITES AND NO SUGAR W SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURANTS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURANTS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLIHTS NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPERATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLIKE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHIDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHISITS AND COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANTS ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACTRLECTROLIKE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT ONE GRAHAM OF SODIUM TWO UNDER MILEGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HIDRATE MY ABODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLITES AND WHILE I DO ANY KOND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'VE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENTY DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THATS DRINK ELEMENT ELEEMENTY DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMENT AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR GENO PO DOCTOR GENO PO WELCOME THANK YOU I'VE REALLY BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE I'M FAMILIAR WITH YOUR WORK AND I KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE EXCITED TO LEARN ABOUT YOUR WORK AS IT RELATES TO SLEEP AS IT RELATES TO PROBLEM SOLVING TREATIVITY EDDICTION AND CRAVING RELAPSE AND A NUMBER OF OTHER IMPORTANT TOPICS SO TO START THINGS OFF I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO EDUCATE US A BIT ABOUT THIS SLHING THAT WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH AND YET VERY FEW OF US UNDER STAND WHICH IS SLEEP AND IF YOU WOULD COULD YOU DESCRIBE THE VARIOUS PHASES OF SLEEP THAT EXIST WHAT DISTINGUISH THEM AND PERHAPS FRAMELESS WITHIN THE CONTECT OF WHAT WOULD A PERFECT NIGHTS SLEEP LOOK LIKE CALCA HOW LONG WOULD IT LAST MORE O LESS AND WHAT WOULD THE BIOLOGY LOOK LIKE BUT WHAT IS A PERFECT NIGHT SLEEP A YE THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I SO SLEEP IS REALLY DIFFERENT FROM WAKEFROM US AND IN FACT CAN'T BE REPLACED BY ANY STATE OF WAKEFUM THIS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COME UP WITH SO FAR AM OUR VRAIN CHEMISTRY IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND IN THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF SLEEP WHICH THERE ARE IS NON RAMMAN RAM ARE THE TWO MAJOR STATES OF SLEEP AND EVERY ANIMAL WE STUDIED SO FAR SEEMS TO HAVE BOTH OF THE STATES A ANYWAY THOSE TWO STATES ARE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER TWO AND EVEN WITHIN NON RAM THERE ARE THREE STATES STAGE ONE WHICH IS WHICH YOU SLEEP IN TO WHEN YOU FIRST FALLING A SLEEPES DOSING THERE'S KIND OF AN INTERESTING RHYTHM THAT GOES ON IN THE RAIN IS CAND OF A FAST GAMA RITHEM AND THEN THER STAGE TOO WHICH IS A REALLY CLO STATE WE SORT OF USE TO IGNOREI SLEEP RESEGS BECAUSE IT WIS A TRANSIENT STATE WE SWEEN WAKEFULNESS IN THE DEEP STAGE THREE SLOWAVE SLEEP WHICH IS THE MOST IMPRESSIVELY DIFFERENT AND THEN A AND BETWEEN THAT AND REM SLEEP SO STAGE TO I'LL TALK A LIT LABIT MORE ABOUT AND THEN THE DEEP SLOWAVE SLEEP STAPE WHICH IS WHEN BIG SLOWAVE SLEEP THROUGH OUR BRAIN AND NOW WE REALIZE THAT IT CLEANS OUR BRAIN A ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THOSE BIG SLOWAVES DO AS CLEANS ARE RAIN AND DOES OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS TO RESTORE US A FROM THA DAY OF WAKEFULNESS AND THEN REM SLEEP WHICH IS THE MOST POPULAR BECAUSEES WHEN WE HAVE THE MOST ACTIVE DREAMS AND A WHEN WOU WAKE UP SOMEONE OUT OF REM SLEEP THOU'GL ALMOST ALWAYS REPORT HAVING DREAMS SOMETHING REALLY BAZAAR THAT'S CALLED REMSLEEP RAP AND I MOVEMENT SLEEP SO THOSE ARE THE FOR STAPS OF SLEEP OF HUMAN SLEEP AND WE CYCLE THROUGH THEM EVERY NINETY MINUTES OR SO WHEN WE GO TO SLEEP SAY TEN TEN THIRTY ELEVEN O'CLOCK A OUR FIRST REM SLEEP PERIED COMES ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIVE MINUTES AFTER WE FALL ASLEEP AND A LAST ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES ACTUALLY IT COMES ABOUT NINETY FIVE MINUTES AND LAST TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES AND THEN A WE START OVER AGAIN AND WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE OF THOSE PER NIGHT FOR PERFECT NIGHT SLEEP FOUR OR FIVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO A PERFECT NIGHT SLEEP IS SEVEND A HALF EIGHT HOURS THERE WAS A REALLY GREAT STUDY THAT A PUT PEOPLE IN AT SEMI DARKENED ROOM WITH NOTHING BUT THE BED FOR TWELVE HOURS EVERY DAY FOR A MONTH AND WHAT PEOPLE DID INISHALEY IS BECAUSE BECAUSE WE'RE IN A SLEEP DEPRIVED NATION IS THAT THEY SLEPT A LOT MORE THAN USUAL LIKE TEN OR ELEVEN HOURS OF THE TWELVE AND THEN THEY LEVELED OFF AFTER WEEK OR TWO TO ABOUT EIGHT HOURS IN FIFTEEN MINUTES OF SLEEP SO YOU ACTUALLY CAN'T OVER SLEEP AND WE HAD NOTHING ELSE TO DO BUT SLEEP AND THEY WOULD ROUND OFF TO ON AVERAGE EIGHT HOURS IN FIFTEEN MINUTES AN NIGHT AND THEN SPEND THE REST E TIME TWITTLING THEIR THUMS HUMMING TUNES JUSTER DAY DREAMING I WON'T GET BACK TO THE CONTR O PERFECT NIGHTS SLEEP BUT I'M ENTREAE BY THIS IDEA THAT PEOPLE CAN'T OVER SLEEP I'M OFTEN ASKED WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN GET TOO MUCH SLEEP AND WHETHER NOT SLEEPING TOO LONG LONG ESCUSE ME CAN MAKE US GROGGY THE NEXT TO DAY A IS THERE ANYTHING TOO THAT UM AND HOW DOES ONE DETERMINE HOW LONG THEY SHOULD SLEEP RA ON AVERAGE ON AVERAGE YET WELL AT THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE DIFFERENT PEOPLE NEED SEEM TO NEED DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF SLEEP BUT WE DON'T REALLY EVEN KNOW EXACTLY WHAT SLEEP IS FOR SO WHAT THEY NEED IS YOU KNOW KIND OF IT'S YOU KNOW MERCY MERCY AM SO WE DO KNOW A LOT OF THINGS THAT SLEEP DI DOES AND OUT FOR US BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THOSE STHINGS TAKE SO HOW LONG WE NEED TO SLEEP IS ALSO JUST A BIG QUESTION MARK BUT SOME PEOPLE DON'T FEEL RESTED UNTIL THEY'VE SLEPT NINE HOURS SINCE SOME PEOPLE DON'T FEEL RESTED AFTER THREE OR FOUR AND A HALF A BUT MOST PEOPLE IF THEY CONSISTENTLY DEPRIVE THEMSELVES OF SLEEP SO THAT THEY'RE ONLY SLEEPING FOUR FOUR AND HALF HOURS AND NIGHT BUILD UP A COGNITIVE DEAF AS IT THAT JUST BUILDS UP OVER TIME THEM MORE NIGHTS YOU HAVE WITH SLEEP TO DEPRIVATION THE MORE COGNATIVE DEAF AS THAT YOU HAVE AND SO YOU NEED SLEEP AGAIN TO SLEEP MORE TO RECOVER NOW THE QUESTION YOU HAD ABOUT AM YOU OVER AND YOU ALWAYS TLE NI SLEEP TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S TOO MUCH YOU KNOW THAY WE I GROWING UP AM WHEN I WAS AN HIGH SCHOOL A MI GROLFREND'S DAD HAND THIS BELIEF THAT NO ONE SHOULD SLEEP IN PASS SIX I AM SO HE WOULD WAKE ALL THE THERE WERE TWO CHILDREN IN THAT HOME HE WOULD WAKE UP THE KIDS IN THAT HOUSE YET TO SING AGAINST OVER SLEE N REGARDLESS OF WHEN PEOPLE WHEN WHI SLEEP AN I W SOUGHT THAT WAS AM AN INTERESTING MENTALITY M AAT TERRIBLE ACTUALLY BE AS WHAT THAT WILL DO AS IT'LL PUT YOU MAKE YOU SLEEP YER THA NEXT NIGHT TO GET TO BED ON TIME SO IT'LL BUILDS UP YOUR HOMIASTATIC NEED IF YOU WAKE UP TOO EARLY BUT AM SO I DON'T THINK YOU CAN OVER SLEEP BUT PEOPLE WHO SLEEP A LOT LIKE PEOPLE SLEEP OVER NINE HOURS IT'S PROBABLY INDICATIVE OF SOME OTHER PROBLEM BECAUSE IN FACT IF YOU HAVE A A LOT OF DIFFERENT CONDITIONS THIY WILL CAUSE YOU TO SLEEP A LOT MORE PROBABLY BECAUSE WHAT IT DOES AS T INTERFERES WITH YOUR EFFICIENT SLEEP THE EFFICIENCY OF YOUR SLEEP SO IF YOU FIND YOURSELF SLEEPING CONSISTENTLY NINE HOURS PLESS EVERY NIGHT THEN YOU MIGHT WANT A CONSULT THE DOCTOR ABOUT MAYBE WHAT ELSE IT MIGHT BE IT COULD BE CANCER IT COULD BE AM SLEEP APNIA THAT IS EFFECTS A LOT OF PEOPLE IT COULD BE THAT YOUR SLEEP IS SUPER INEFFICIENT BECAUSE YOUR SNORING A LOT MORE THAN YOU KNOW OR YOUR WAKING UP A LOT MORE THAN YOU KNOW EVERY NIGHT SEE YOU MIGHT WANT TO SLEEP STUDY JUST TO SEE HOW YOU SLEEP IS AND THEN SEE WHAT ELSE MIGHT BE CAUSING YOU TO SLEEP SO MUCH AND THAT WOULDN'T BE IF SOMEBODY IS SLEEPING NINE OR TEN HOURS YOU KNOW'T EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE YOU MEAN IF THEY'RE CONSISTENTLY SLEEPING FROM MORE THAN NINE A ALWAYS FEEL LIKE THEY NEEDED IN ORDER FUNCTION COGNITIVELY THE NEXT DAY IF IT MIGHT BE THAT YOUR SLEEP IS JUST NOT EFFICIENT AND YOU MIGHT ONE LOOK INTO WHY THAT THAT'S THE CASE INTERESTING  FORGIVE ME FOR THE ANECDOTE BUT I CAN'T RESIST YEARS AGO I WENT TO AN ACCU PUNCTURIST AND UM YOU GAVE ME THESE RED PILLS UM OF WHICH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY CONTAIN A BUT I TOOK THEM BECAUSE YEU TOLD ME THEY WOULD HELP WITH MY SLEEP AND I WOULD FALL ASLEEP ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES AFTER TAKING THEM AND I WOULD HAVE INCRESIT INCREDIBLY SCUSE ME VIVID DREAMS AND I'D WAKE UP FOR R FIVE HOURS AFTER HAVING GONE TO SLEEP FEELING COMPLETELY RESTED SOMETHING THI NEVER REALLY EXPERIENCE INJUSTIN ON CONSISTENT BASIS I WANT TO DO MASSPECT ON THESE PILLS I LL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WAS IN THEM WHAT SO EVERAND IF YOU MASPECT O THA EL EXAC  SOMEPINL THOUGHT AM THAT PERHAPS THEY HAD GH B GAMAHIDROCS AND BEUTERANE WHICH IS BY THE W ANY LEGAL DRUG IT CAN KILL YOU IT'S NOT IT NOT SOMETHING YOU WANT M BUT ANYWAY IF IF EVER SOMEONE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RED PILLS WERE AL TE VERY Y AM TILY AND THIS IS NOT A RED PILL OF THE OF THE OTHER SORT RED PILL THIS IS JUST THE RED SLEEP PILLS DON SING A COULD HAVE BEEN EVEN A PLOCIBA EFFECT CA FLACIBOS STREMELY STRONG O ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW THERE WAS REALLY SOMETHING TO THESE RED I LE E I SHOT OUT TO ACOU PUNCTUROUS  AND THE EASTERN MEDICINE AM BUT TO RETURN THE SIGHT TO THIS IDEA OF THE ARCHITECTURE OF A PERFECT NIGHT SLEEP SO YOU SAID AM WE FALL ASLEEP THE FIRST NINETY MINUTES OF SLEEP REM SLEEP RAPID I MOVEMENT SLEEP WILL ARRIVE AT ABOUT NINETY FIVE MINUTES IN YEDES THAT MEAN THAT THE REST OF THAT NINETY MINUTES IS CONSUMED WITH SLOW WAVE SLEEP YAT NON REN SLEEP AND WHAT ABOUT THE SLEEP WHERE WE ARE LIGHTLY A SLEEP AND WE MIGHT HAVE A DREAM THAT HAS US SOMEHOW THINKING ABOUT MOVEMENT OR THAT WE JOLT OUR SANS AWAKE THAT OFTEN HAPPENS EARLY IN THE NIGHT YT YET THAT'S THE FIRST STAGE STAGE ONE AND STAGE TO SLEEP AND STAGE TWO SLEEP IS REALLY COL BECAUSE THAT HAS SOMETHING CALLED SLEEP SPINDLES AND CATE COMPLEXES AND WHAT SLEEP SPINDLES ARE ER A A LITTLE BOF ACTIVITY THAT'S TEN TO FIFTEEN HURTS IN FREQUENCY IT'S A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE FALUMIS IN THE QUARTEX THE GAFALLEN AS IS THE GATEWAY TO CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE NEO CARTEX SINO PROCESSES ALL OUR COGNITION AND AM SO IT'S IT'S THESE SPINDLES THER CALLED SLEEP SPINDLES AND IF YOU WAKE UP OUT OF THAT STATE YOU WILL OFTEN REPORT A DREAM  LIKE A HALLUCINATION STYLE DREAM IT WON'T BE A LONG DREAM REPORT LIKE YOU HAVE OUT OF REM SLEEP BUT IT WILL BE SOME HALLUCINATION STATE IND DURING WHILE WE'RE FALLING ASLEEP WHENDE THE REASON WE CALL IT FALLING ASLEEP IS BECAUSE IN STAGE ON IN STATE TO OUR MUSCLES ARE RELAXING AND IF THEREIS PART OF OUR BRAIN THAT'S CONSCIOUS OF ENOUGH TO SORT OF RECOGNIZE THAT RELAXATION WILL FEEL LIKE WE'RE FALLING AND WILL JERK AWAKE SO OFTEN THAT HALLUCINATION S CALLED HYPNICACHIC HALLUCINATION WILL FEEL LIKE ILL E INCLUDE SOME FALLING ASPECT PET WILL WAKE UP OUT OF THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING O MAIT NOT LONG FELT THAT SENSATION OF ALMOST LA DROPPING BACK INTO MY HEAD AM SO MUCH SO THAT IF I ELEVATE MY FEET JUST SLIGHTLY AN IGT TILT MY HEAD BACK JUST SLIGHTLY I'M IN ORDER TO GO TO SLEEP Y FIND TI FALL ASLEEP MUST MUCH FASTER INTERESTT IT DOES FEEL AS EVEO MEN A FALL LIKE ALMOST IN TO DO BACKWARDS SOMMERS ALL FAS YOU REALLY LIKE THE THE SENSATION AND USUALLY BECAUSE IT PROCEEDS FALLING DEEPLY US YE THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING A SOME ODY HAS TO DO A STUDY OF ELEVATED FEET AND YETHER THERE'S A LITTLE BIT ON A BODY POSITION AND SLEEP AND SOME OF THE WASH OUT THAT WILL TALK ABOUT SO EARLY IN THE NIGHT AM YET THESE LIGHTER STAGES OF SLEEP LESS RAPAN EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP WHAT CAN WE SAY ABOUT THE DREAMS THAT OCCUR DURING THE SAY FIRST AND SECOND AM YOUKNOW NINETY MINUTES PCYCHLES SLEEP ARE THEY QUITE DIFFERENT THIN THE PATTERNS OF SLEEP AND DREAMING THAT OCCUR LATER IN THE NIGHT OR TOWARD MORNING WELL OOK HAE THAT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION THERE IS A LOT OF FASCITS TO IT A THERE IS OME EVIDENCE THAT THE FIRST FOUR HOURS OF SLEEP ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR MEMORY PROCESSING A AND IN FACT IF YOU'VE LEARNED SOMETHING KNEW THAT DAY OR HAVE EXPERIENCED A NEW A SENSORY MOTORS EXPERIENCE THEN YOUR EARLY SLEEP DREAMS WILL INCORPORATE THAT EXPERIENCE MUCH MORE THAN THE LATER SLEEP DREAMS A LATER IS THAT MEMORY GETS CONSOLIDATED FROM THE EARLY STRUCTURES WHICH ARE THE HYPPOCAMPUS DEEP IN THE TEMPORAL LOBE TO THE QARTEX IN A DISTRIBUTED FASHION THAT MEMORY SEEMS TO MOVE FROM THAT HYPPOCAMPUS TO THE CUARTEX AND ALSO THE DREAMS THAT INCORPORATE THAT MEMORY ALSO MOVE LATER IN THE NIGHT SO A NOBODY KNOWS WHY BUT IT DOES THERE WAS A GREAT STUDY BY CEDARTO REBEERO WHO STUDIED THE CONSOLIDATION OF MEMORYES FROM THE CARTEC FROM THE HYPPOCAMPUS TO THE QUARTEX IN A RAT ACROSS THE PERIOD OF A FULL DAY SLEEP BECAUSE RAT SLEEP IN THE DAYTIME AND HE FOUND THAT EACH SUBSEQUENT REM'S SLEEP PERIOD MOVED THAT MEMORY FROM THE HYPPOCAMPUS TO THE FIR FIRST ARIA THAT PRODECTS TOIT IN THE SECOND ARIA THAN THE THIRD ARIA AND YOU CAN SEE THE MEMORY MOVING A THROUGH THAT THROUGHOUT THE SLEEP COOL PERIOTA VERY WOOLS I AVER READ THAT STUDY SO AM THERE'S NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FORMONS A SOCIATE WITH THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF SLEEP WE KNOW THET MELLATON AND IS A HORMON OF THE NIGHT TIME OF NIGHT TIME AN MAKES AF SLEEPY A WHAT ABOT GROTHORMON RELEASE WHEN DOES THAT OCCURR DURING SLEEP SO GROTHOMAN RELEASE HAPPENS ALL DAY LONG AND ALL NIGHT LONG BUT THE DEEP SLOWESLEEP THAT YOU GET THE VERY FIRST SLEEP CYCLE A IS WHEN YOU GET A BIG BOLIS OF GROTHOMON RELEASE AND IN MEN AND WOMEN EQUALLY AND IF YOU MISS THAT FIRST DEEP SLOWE SLEEP PERIOD YOU ALSO MISS THAT BIG BOLIS OF GROTHOMON RELEASE AND YOU MIGHT GET ULTIMATELY ACROSS THE DAY JUST AS MUCH OVER ALL GROTHOMON RELEASE BUT ANDROCHONOLOGISTS WILL TELL YOU THAT BIG BOLISES DO DIFFERENT THINGS THAN A LITTLE BIT EKED OUT OVER TIME SO THAT IS WHEN WE KNOW THERE'S ALSO A BIG PUSHD TO SYNTHESIZE PROTHIC PROTINES A SO THAT'S WHEN THE PROTINE SYNTHISIS PART THAT BUILDS MEMORIES FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR BRAIN HAPPENS IN THAT FIRST CYCLE OF SLEEP SO YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THAT ESPECIALLY IF YOU'VE LEARNED SOMETHING REALLY BIG IND NEEDS NEEDS MORE SYNAPTIC SPACE TO INCODE IT HOW WOULD SOMEBODY MISS THAT FIRST NITIN MADRIVING THEMSELVES YES SO DO LET SAY I NORMALLY GO TO SLEEP AT AM TEN PIM A AND THEN FROM TEN TO ELEVEN THIRTY WOULD BE THIS FIRST PASE OF SLEEP IN THAT'S WHEN THE GROTHO BIG BOLS OF GROTHROMON WOULD BE RELEASED DOES THAT MEAN THAT IF I GO TO SLEEP INSTEAD AT ELEVEN THIRTY OR MIDNIGHT THAT I MISS THAT FIRST PASE OF SLEEP YET WHY IS NOT THE CASE THAT I GET THAT FIRST HASE OF SLEEP JUST SIMPLY STARTING LATER IT IS A BEAUTIFUL CLOCK THAT WE HAVE IN OUR BADY THAT KNOWS WHEN THING SHOULD HAPPEN AND IT'S EVERYCELL IN OUR BODY HAS A CLOCK AND ALL THOSE CLOCKS ORE NORMALLY SYNCHRANIZED AND THE CIRCAN CRCADEAN CLOCKS I SYNCRANIZED AND SO OURSELVES ARE READY TORESPOND TO THAT GROWTHORMA RELEASE AT A PARTICULAR TIME AND IF WE MISS IT AND IT'S A TIME IN RELATION TO THE MARMELOTONEAN ALSO SO IF YOU MISS IT YE YOU MIGHT GET SOME GROWTHARMAN RELEASE BUT IT'S OCCURRING AT A TIME WHEN THAT YOUR CLOCK HAS ALREADY MOVE TO THE NEXT PHASE AND SO IT'S IT'S JUST A CLOCKNING  I DON'T THINK EM WE CAN OVERSTATE THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBE AND TO BE HONEST DESPITE KNOWING A BIT ABOUT THE SLEEP RESEARCH IN CIRCADIAN BIOLOGY THIS IS THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT IVE EVER HEARD THIS THAT IF YOU NORMALLY GO TO SLEEP IT A PARTICULAR TIME AND GROWTHHORMON IS RELEASED IN THAT FIRST PHASE OF SLEEP THAT YOU CAN'T SIMPLY INITIATE YOUR SLEEP BOUT LATER AND EXPECT A CAPTURE THAT FIRST PHASE OF SLEEP YE THAT'S INCREDIBLE AND I THINK IMPORTANT AND UM AS MANY LISTENERS ARE PROBABLY REALIZING ALSO HIGHLY ACTIONABLE SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE FAIRLY CONSISTENT BED TIMES IN ADDITION TO FAIRLY CONSISTENT WAKE TIME YHS OUT RIGHT EXACTLY AND IN FACT ONE OF THE BEST MARKERIS OF GOOD NOR LOGICAL HEALTH WHEN WE GET OLDER IS CONSISTENT BEDTIMES WELL OK UM I DON'T WANT A BACK TRACK BUT I DID WRITE DOWN SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS A IMPORTANT FOR ME TO RESOLVE UM OR FOR YOU TO RESOLVE SO IMAN ASKED THIS UM PEOPLE THAT SLEEP NINE HOURS OR MORE PERHAPS THAT REFLECTING AN ISSUE A SOME UNDER LYING ISSUE PERHAPS IS AM BEING A TEA NAJOR OR AN ADOLESCENT AND UNDERGOING A STAGE OF OF A DEVELOPMENT WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF BODILY IN BRAIN GROWTH IN EXCEPTION TO THAT BECAUSE YES I DON'T RECALL SLEEPING ATON WHEN I WAS A TEEN AGR IHAD A TON OF ENERGY BUT I KNOW A FEU TEEN AGORS UM AND THEY SLEEP ALAYA I DELL JUST SLEEP IND SLEEP AND SLEEP AND SHOULD WE LET THEM SLEEP AN SLEY AND SLEEP I ANT SLEEP O KSO THAT'S THE ONE EXCEPTION WHAT ABOUT A LIKE BABIES O KA IT WHEN WHEN YOU'RE DEVELOPING SOMETHING IN YOUR BRAIN ARE THE REST OF YOUR BODY YOU REALLY NEED SLEEP TO HELP ORGANIZE THAT AN MEAN SLEEP IS DOING REALLY HARD WORK IN ORGANIZING OUR BRAINS AND AND MAKING IT DEVELOP RIGHT AND IF WE DEPRIVE OURSELVES OF SLEEP WE WILL ACTUALLY ALSO JUST I LIKE LIKE I SAID WE HAVE A DAILY CLOCK WE ALSO HAVE A DEVELOPMENTAL CLOCK AND WE CAN MISS A DEVELOPMENTAL WINDOW IF WE DON'T LET OURSELVES SLEEP EXTRA LIKE WE NEED TO WHAT OTHER THINGS INHIBIT GROWTH HOMEON RELEASE OR OTHER COMPONENTS OF THIS FIRST STAGE OF SLEEP IN OTHER WORDS IF I GO TO SLEEP RELIGIOUSTLY EVERY NIGHT AT TEN P M ARE THER THINGS THAT I PERHAPS DO IN THE PRECEDING HOURS THE PRECEDING DAY LIKE INJEST KAFFIN OR ALKOLHOL THAT CAN MAKE THAT FIRST STAGE OF SLEEP LESS EFFECTIVE EVEN IF I'M GOING TO SLEEP AT THIS SAME TIME ALKOLHOL D INITELY WILL DO THAT BECAUSE ALCOHOL IS A REM SLEEP SUPPRESSEN AND EVEN SUPPRESSES SOME OF THAT STAGE TWO TRANSITION TO REM WITH THOSE SLEEP SPINDLES AND THOSE SLEEP SPINDLES WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THEIR FUNCTION YET BUT THEI'RE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR MOVING MEMORIES A TO OUR QUARTEX IT'S A UNIQUE TIME WHEN OUR HIPPOCAMPAS THE SORT OF LIKE THE RAM OF OUR BRAINS A WRITES IT TO A HARD DISK AND AWHICH IS THE QARTEX AND THERE IT'S A UNIQUE TIME WHEN THEY'RE CONNECTED SO IF YOU DON'T WANT A MISS THAT YOU DON'T WANT MISS REMSLEEP WHEN IS ALSO O PART OF THE CONSOLIDATION PROCESS AND A SCHEME A CHANGING PROCESS AND ALCOHOL IN THER INNOW BEFORE WE GO TO SLEEP WE'LL DO THAT AND TELL WE'VE METABOLIZED ALCOHOL AND PUT IT OUT OF OUR BODIES IT WILL EFFECT OUR SLEEP BADLY PROBABLY FAIR TO SAY NO INGESTION OF ALCOHOL WITHIN THE FOR TO SIX HOURS PRECEEDING SLEEP GIVEN THE HALF LIFE GIVEN HWER AT ALL R AT ALL WOULD BE BETTER BUT I ASE SOME PEOPLE REFUSE TO GO THAT WAYET MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OFS O K I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DOSE RESPONSE IS THAT A THERE AR STUDIES OUT THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT RIT SO WE'RE STILL IN THE FIRST STAGE OF SLEEP AND I APALL DIES FOR SLOWING ASTOWN BUT IT SONDS I GETS IN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANTFIRST PHAS OF SLEEP WHAT ABOUT THE SECOND AND THIRD NINETY MINUTE BLOCKS OF SLEEP IS OR ANYTHING THAT MAKES THOSE AM UNIQUEWHAT WHAT IS THEIR SIGNATURE A BESIDES THE FACT THAT THEY COME SECOND AND THIRY AND THE NIGHT THERE'S MORE AND MORE REM SLEEP THE LATER THE NIGHT WE GET A THERE'S ALSO A CHANGE IN HARMONS IN O TH GROTHORMAN AND A MELOTONE AND LEVELS ARE STIING TO DECLINE BUT OTHER HARMONS ARE PICKING UP SO IT IS A REALLY DIFFERENT STAGE THAT YOU ALSO DON'T WANT TO SHORT CHANGE OURSELF IN AND I THINK THAT'S THE STAGE MANY STUDIES ARE SHOWING THAT THOSE OF THE TIMES IN SLEEP WHEN THE MOST CREATIVITY CAN HAPPEN THAT'S WHEN OUR DREAMS CAN INCORPORATE AND PUT TOGETHER OLD AND NEW THINGS TOGETHER INTO A NEW WAY AND AM AND OUR SCHEMEA AR BUILT DURING THAT TIME SOA THEAT WE CAN CHANGE OUR MINDS BEST DURING THOSE FACES OF SLEEP COULD YOU LAVERYAL IT MORE ON SCHEMA A YET NO ONE I DON'T THINK ANY ONE ON THIS SPARCAST AS EVER DISCUST SCHEMA I'M A LITTLE BUT FAMILIAR WITH SCHEME O FROM MI AM COURSES ON PSYCHOLOGY BUT IT'S BEEN A WHILE SO IF YOU JUST A REFRESHMY HAN EVERYN WELL IT IT'S STILL A A CONCEPTURE O SCHEME OWT IS AS HOW DO YOU A LAD ORI I THINK OF SCHEMEA AS AM LIKE WE HAVE A SCHEMEA OF CHRISTMAS RIGHT WE T WE WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF IDEAS THAT WE SO TOGETHER AND CALL CHRISTMAS A HOLIDAY SEASON IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHEREITS COLD WE HAVE SANTACLAS AND RAINDEER AND JINGLE BELLS AND EVEN THINGS THAT ARE FALSE THAT BUT WE NORMALLY ASSOCIATE WITH CHRISTMAS PRESENTS FAMILY GATHERING WHEN IT IS ALL OF THE STUFF IT'S SOWN TOGETHER INTO ONE THERE'S A THREAT LINKING THEM ALL AND WE CAN JUST GIVE OURSELVES A LIST OF WORDS AND IM AND NONE OF THEM CONTAIN THE WORD CHRISTMAS AND THEN ASK PEOPLE LATER IM YOU KNOW GIVE HEM ANOTHER LIST OF WORDS AND INCLUDE THE WORD CHRISTMAS AND THEY'LL SAY O YAH THAT WORD WAS THERE BECAUSE IN THEIR MINDS THEY ROUGHT UP THAT WORD CHRISTMAS BECAUSE IT'S PART OF THAT HOLE SCHEME US SO THAT'S WHAT IT'S SORT OF IT RELATED LOT OF RELATED CONCEPTS I GUESS ITHING ABOUT SORT LIKE O THE DEATH TOP OF MY COMPUTER IM WOULD SCARE SOME PEOPLE BUT IT'S JUST ATON A FOLDERS BUT EACH OF THE FOLDER NAMES MEANS SOMETHING VERY CLEAR AND SPECIFIC TO ME I AN INSIDE OF THOSE FOLDERS ARE COLLECTIONS OF THINGS THAT THA MAKE SENSE IN TERMS OF HOW THEIR BATCH AS AT CON'T ONE WAY EXACTLY NOW THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO THINK OF IT AND AND WHEN YEU'RE IN REM SLEEP IN THE LATER PARTS OF THE NIGHT AND THAT TRANSITION TO REM THAT'S WHEN YOURE COMPUTER OF YOUR BRAIN IS COPENING FOLDERS AND COMPARING DOCUMENT SEEING IF IS THERE ANYTHING THE SAME IF THESE TWO DOCUMENTS LOOK VERY MUCH THE SAME BUT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF DIFFERENCE AND IT CAN IT CAN LINK THOSE CONCEPTIONALLY SO THAT THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE ORIGINS OF CREATIVITY IS FINDING THINGS THAT A RELATED MAY BE JUST LINKED A LITTLE BIT AND YOU CAN FIND THAT LENGTH AND STRENGTHEN IT IF IT TEY NO MAKES YOUR SCHE MAT INTERESTING AND DIFFERENT VERY INTERESTING IM MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF TEND TO WAKE UP BE ONCE DURING MILL THE NIGHT TO USE THE RESTERUM I TRIED TO DRINK LESS FLUID BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP BUT I'VE HEARD ALSO THAT IM THE IMPULSE TO OURANATE I FORGIVE THE TOPIC WHEN THE LOT PEOPLE DEAL WITH THIS SO THE IMPULSE TO OURANATE IS ALSO DECTAY BY HOW QUICKLY YOU DRINK FLUID ND NOT JUST THE TOTAL VOLUMES ICS WHICH YOU I'M SIPPING FLUIDS MORE SLOWLY FROM MY LAST BEVERAGE OF THE DAY WHICH SEEMS TO HELP BUT THE POINT HERE IS A THING A LOT OF PEOPLE WAKE UP ONCE IN MHELE THE NIN OFTENTIMES TO USE THE REST ROOM BUT SOMETIMES JUST AROUND THREE A M AND MIGHT BE UP FOR A FEW MINUTES HOPEFULLY NOT ON THEIR PHONE OR VIEWING ANY BRIGHT LOLUME WHICH CAN CAUSE MORE WAKEFULNESS BUT THEN GO BACK TO SLEEP IS THERE ANY KNOWN DETRIMENT TO THIS MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WAKING OR SHOULD WE CONSIDER IT A NORMAL FEATURE FOR SOME PEOPLE'S SLEEP AR CA YI THINK WE SHOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT ACTUALLY I THINK YOU KNOW SLEEP IS REALLY INCREDIBLY WELL HOME AESTATICALLY REGULATED AND SO REALLY DON'T WORRY ABOUT HOW MUCH YOUR SLEEPING AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT INTENTIOALLY DEPRIVING YOURSELF OF SLEEP BY DOING SOMETHING REALLY REWARDING AND EXCITING BECAUSE EVEN THAT IS STRESSFUL TO YOUR BODY AND DEPRIVES YOU A LOT OF THINGS FOR TALKING ABOUT SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT AM IT'S ABSOLY NORMAL TO WAKE UP AT LEAST ONCE IN THEMIDDLE THE NIGHT TO GO TO THE BATH ROOM AND AS LONG AS YOU CAN GET BACK TO SLEEP IN A REASONABLE MOUNT OF TIME IM YOU KNOW OR EVEN IF IT TAKES YOU AN HOUR DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A LIFE STYLE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO THEN MAKE UP THAT SLEEP EITHER THE NEXT MORNING OR THE NEXT NIGHT I'M  GOING TO BED A LITTLE EARLIER SO FIND IR CANT CIRECTLY THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A SYMETRY TO SLEEP THAT CATCHING THAT FIRST PHASE OF SLEEP IT'S LIKE O EITHER EDITOR YOU DON'T AND YOU HAVE TO GET AT BY GOING TO SLEEP YES I SHLL THE SAME TIME WAY I MAY BE PLUSSER MIN IS FIFTEEN MINUTES YETO YE A BUT THEN IF I WAKE UP IN MILL THE NIGHT AND GO BACK TO SLEEP I CAN NOT CATCH UP BUT I CAN GATHER ALL THE SLEEP THAT I WOULD HAVE GOTTN HAD I JUST SLEPT THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH THE NIGHT SE YAE YND AND WE DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY THE ANSWER TO WHETHER NOT THE SLEEP IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN THAT EARLY SLEEP IN THE LATE SLEEP IS IN FACT DIFFERENT FOR ANOTHER REASON AND WHETHER DEPRIVING YOURSELF OF SLEEP FROM SAY ONE TE TO THIRTY IN THE MORNING IS BAD IN A DIFFERENT WAY WE DON'T KNOW WELL I SUPPOSE I IM THE EXPERIMENT IN THAT CASE BECAUSE I DO TEND TO WAKE UP ONCE ORNIG DEDN OVE A SO HAVE COME TO A'M RECOGNIZEIT AS PART OF MY NORMAL SLEEP AR NANT ENTURE I DON'T OBSESS OVER IT I DO NOTICE THIT WHEN I GO BACK TO SLEEP AND ESPECIALLY TOWARD MORNING THAT MY SLEEP IS INCREDIBLY DEEP MY DREAMS ARE INCREDIBLY VIVID ILI DON'T ALWAYS REMEMBER THEM BUT WHAT IS UNIQUE PERHAPS ABOUT THE ARCHITECTURE OF DREAMS AND SLEEP IN THE WUT SLEE THE LAST THIRD OF THE NIGHT WES OR THE SECOND HALF OF THE NIGHT YET YET THE SECOND HALF THE NIGHT WE HAVE LONGER REM SLEEP PERIODS AND THOSE ARE CONSIDERD THE DEEPEST SLEEP EVEN THOUGH SLOWAVE SLEEP BIG SLOAVEIS CONSIDERED DEEP IT IS DEEP THAT AF ALL SLOWAVE SLEEP DEEP SLEEP AN REM SLEEP RAPID OT ME BUT NOW YOUR TELLING ME THAT REM SLEEP AS I SHUL TTAN DEOR SLEEP O KE THERE NEEDS TO BE NE NOMINCLY ER SRERTERS YOUREATION VOLLID DEEPER NOO LES THE REAS MIG CALE SLOWAVE SLEEP DEEP SLEEP IS BECAUSE IT SDIFFICULT TO AROUSE PEOPLE OUT OF THAT STATE I AND WHEN YOU DO AROUSE THEM OUT OF THAT STATE THERE MEST MUST OFTEN CONFUSED AND JUST WANT TO GO BACK INTO SLEEP AND CAN GO BACK PRETTY EASILEP IF YOU AROUSE SOME ONE OUT OF REM SLEEP THE'RE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY KIND OF ALMOST LIKE WAKEFULNESS THAT SO WIS SO VIVID BUT IN FACT IF YOU GIVE SOME ONE AN NON THREATENING KIND OF STIMULATION LIKE SOMEBODY DROPPING KEYS OR AM A PING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT INSTEAD OF WAKING THAT SAME VOLUME WELL WAKE SOME ONE UP OUT OF NON RENT SLEEP BUT AT OF FREM SLEEP IN UNSTEAD LENGTHEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME OR MAKE IT EVEN MORE DENSE YERE RAPID I MOVEMENTS MORE DENSE AND OFTEN PEOPLE WILL INCORPORATE THAT SOUND INTO THEIR DREAMS SO THE BODY IN BRAIN ARE SOMEHOW CONSCIOUS OF THE AM OF THE SOUND AND I'VE HEARD ALSO SMELLS CAN EVEN MAKE IT INTO OUR O DREAMS AND IN REM SLEEP BUT THAT WE IT DOESN'T ROUSE US IT DASS AROUSE US AS OFTEN YE AND MAY BE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY REMSLEEP IS DEEPER IS SPECIALLY IN A DULTS AND OLDER PEOPLE THAT DEEP SLOWAVE SLEEP GOES AWAY SO IT'S NOT AS DEEP IT'S NOT AS BIG THE SLOWWAVES AREN'T IS LARGE WHICH IS PROBABLY PROBLEMATIC THAT WE ARE NOT SURE AND SO THEN REM SLEEP IT BECOMES THE DEEPEST STAGE ACTUALLY IN CHILDREN IT'S KIND OF A TOSET BECAUSE THEY IT'S REALLY HARD TO WAKE THEM UP OUT OF THAT DEEP SLOWAVE SLEEP AND IN FACT AM FIRE ALARM RMS DON'T WAKE THEM UP EVEN REALLY LOUD FIRELARMSOUTE OF THAT STATE OF SLEEP SO THAT'S WHY THEY'RE TRYING TO CHANGE FIRELARMS SO THAT INSTEAD OF SOMETHING THAT THE KIDSTONE ASSOCIATE WITH ANYTHING LIKE THE   WHATEVER THEY DON'T ASSOCIATEEN IT SAYS THEIR NAME OR SOMETHING ELSE THAT MAYBE U LESS LOUD THAT MORE SAILINGT TO THEM ANDILL WAKE THEM I NOW HAVING CARRIED SLEEPING CHILDREN IN FROM THE CAR I DON'T KNOW THAT I WANT CHILDREN TO START WAKING UP FROM SLEEP AN THAT ONE O BEST THINGS TA AT HOME AND THAT KIDS ARE A  SLEEP IN BACKS IT LITERALLY THROW THEM OVER  OUR SHOULDER GENTLY OF COURSE YES AND PUT THEM TO SLEEP IN AND THEY ARE CTLEATLY OUT YE ITWAS E IT IS WONDERFUL ONE ONE OF NATURE'S GIFTS I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED  G ONE IS A VITEM IN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS I'VE BEN TAKING ATHLTIC GREEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND AN TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THERE IS MI STORY TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE OTHLETIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO ME THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GOT IS VERY IMPORTANT ITS POPULATED BY GOT MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE MEAN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURN HEALTH AND THOSE PROBOTICS ENOTH LETIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLETIC GRENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTIGENS VITEMENTS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASE CRIPE IF YOUD LIKE TO TRY ATHLETI GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC

YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEM IND THRE C TOO AGAIN THAT'S THATHLETIC GREENSTOCK CAM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEM IND THREE C TO SO THIS A ENHANCED VOLUME OR OR PROPORTION OF OF RAPINI MOVEMENT SLEEP IN THE SECOND HALF FOR THE NIGHT A RELATES TO MORE ELABORATE DREAMS A WE'RE PARALYZED ERNNS CRECT YES N ARMALATE PARALYZED IN THAT'S REALLY GED BECAUSE THAT'S THE TIME WHEN WHERE ACTIVELY DREAMING STORY LYING DREAMS AND WE CUD A HEARD OURSELVES WE ARE ACTUALLY REALLY CUT OFF FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN TERMS OF TOU KNOW A RESPONDING TO SAY THIS TABLE OR WINDOW OR DOOR AN SO DIFFERENT FROM SLEEP WALKING WHICH IS OUT OF SLOWAY SLEEP AN THAT OF SLOWY SLEEP THAT SLEEP WALKING IS A MIXTURE BETWEEN SLEEP IN WAKEFULNESS E YOU ACTUALY WILL RESPOND TO THE DOOR YOU CAN COOK O FOLMEALA DRIVE YOUR CAR WHILE YOU'RE IN DEEP SLOWI SLEEP AT SCARRY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE KIND TO DO YOU DON'T HAVE VOLUNTARY VOLUNTARY CONTROL OVER IT YOU HAVE NO CONSCIOUS CONTROL OVER IT BUT YOU CAN ACTUALLY SAFELY NAVIGATE ASOME SITUATIONS IN SLEEP WALKING AAND ACTUALLY HAVE A CONVERSATION ALTHOUGH IT MAY NOT MAKE MUCH SENSE WHEN YOUR SLEEP TALKING IN REM SLEEP YOU'RE NOT PROCESSING THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND INSTEAD A WHEN YOU'RE ACTING OUT YOUR DREAMS YOU COULD BE DOING THINGS LYKE WALKING THROUGH A CLATE CLASS WINDOW OR FALLING OFF OF U KNOW DOWN THE STAIRS AM THINGS LIKE THAT SO YOU REALLY WANT YOUR MUSCLES TO BE INACTIVATED DURING RAM SLEEP OTHERWISE YOU WILL ACT OUT THOSE DREAMS AND REALLY HURT YOURSELF OR YOUR BED PARTNER WHAT ABOUT SLEEP TALKING WE'RE TALKING IN SLEEP IM I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY RELATIONSHIPS HAVE IM BEEN SAVED BY SLEEP TALKING BUT I'M GUESSING A FEW HAVE I BEEN DESTROYED AND I'M GUESSING THAT IM  TALKING IN SLEEP COULD HAVE MEANING OR PERHAPS HAS NO MEANING JUST AS DREAMS I COULD HAVE MEANING OR NO MEANI AS WE RECALL THEM YA DO NOT TAKE SLEEP TALKING SERIOUSLY A NO MATTER WHAT PEOPLE SAY IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY REFLECT TRUTH SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOUR BEING MORE TRUTHFUL WHEN YOUR SLEEP TALKING IHAV SAVED A NUMBER OF RELATIUSE U I'M NOT DIRECTING THE SAN ANY ONE IN PARTICULAR  BY I I GUARANTE YOU JUST ED UM NO DID UM SO AS PEOPLE START TO APPROACH MORNING OR THE TIME WHEN THEY NORMALLY WOULD WAKE UP I'VE HEARD THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO IF POSSIBLE COMPLETE ONE OF THESE NINEY MINUTE CYCLES PRIOR TO WAKING UP THAT IS IF YOU SET YOUR ALARM FOR HALF WAY THROUGH ONE OF THESE NINEY MINUTE CYCLES THAT COME LA IN THE NIGHT OF SLEEP THAT IT CAN LEAD TO UM RATHER GROGGY PATTERNS OF WAKING UM SO I'LL JUST ASS YOU DIRECTLY TO YOUUSA AN ALARM CLA I DO NOT A THINKF LY IM IN A MINE OF WORK THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE ME NORMALLY TO DO ANYTHING AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME I DRI BUT WHEN I DO IT I UNLESS IHAVE TO CATCH A PLAIN AND THEN I ALWAYS SET MY ARM JUST IN CASE WELL AS A FELLOW ACADEMIC I CAN TELL YOU THEIR PLENTY OF PUNISHING FEATURES ABOUT BEING ANACADEM ITIS THAT IM THAT OFFSET THE FACT THAT I YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ALARM CLOCK BUT IT IS NICE YOU CAN OFTEN SAT OWN SCADUAL YE SO WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THAT IF POSSIBLE THAT PEOPLE NOT USE AN AWARM CLOCK YET ABSOLUTELY IF YOU CAN JUST LISTEN TO YOUR BODY AND WAKE UP WHEN YOU NEED TO WAKE UP THAT WOULD BE GREAT UM BUT AM ONE OFE THE REASONS WHY WE HAVE SUCH A GROGGINESS 'S CALLED SLEEP IN ERTIA WHEN WE WAKE UP OUT OF THE WRONG STATE WHICH IS AM DEEP SLOWAVE SLEEP IS BECAUSE I LIKEN IT TO I LIKE A WASHING MACHINE PCYCLE THIS NINETY MINUTE CYCLES LIKEHA WASHING MACHINE CYCLE AND AND A THE FIRST PART IS TO ADD WATER RIGHT AND AM THEN YOUR CLOTHES ARE SOAKING WET YOU DON'T WANT TO OPEN THE WASHING MACHINE AND TRY AND FUNCTION PUT THEM ON AND WEAR THEM AROUND WHILE THEY SOAKING WET AND FULL OF SOAP SO YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE CYCLE IS THROUE BEFORE YOU CAN WELL ACTUALLY BUT'S PUT IN THE DRIER TO I EFORE YOU WANT A WEAR THEM AN SO YE YOU CAN FUNCTION IT JUST TAKES A LITTLE WHILE FOR THOSE CLOTHES THAT BRAIN TO DRY OUTSAY YOU CAN ACTUALLY FUNCTION WELL AM BUT IT'S BETTER TO WAKE THROUGH THE WHOLE CYCLE IS COMPLETE AND SO THAT'S WHY YOU WANT TO SET THAT NINE NINETY MINUTE ALARM CLOCK AND AGAIN THAT'S AROUND NINETY MINUTES BECAUSE THE FIRST STAGE OF SLEEP THE FIRST CYCLE OF SLEEP IS OF ACTUALLY A LITTLE LONGER MORE LIKE A HUNDRED AND FIVE UNDRED AND TEN MINUTES PUT THEN THE SECOND ONES IN THIRD ONES THEY GET SORT OF SHORTER AND SHORTER IS THE NIGHT GOES ON AND IN THE LAST FEW CYCLES YOU'RE JUST DOING THEN AND TO REM SLEEP CYCLE WHICH TAKES LAST TIME AND IF YOU WAKE UP AT OF REM SLEEP ES USUALLY NO PROBLEM COGNATIVELY YOU FARE YOU'RE GOOD TO GO ARE YOU AFFAN OF OF SLEEP TRACKERS I SURE YE IFDO YOU USE ONE I HAVE ONE AN I DON'T TAKE I DON'T I DON'T A LIVE MY LIFE BY THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE THE BEST ONES RIGHT HOUR ABOUT SEVENTY PER CENT EFFECTIVE IT STAGING YOUR SLEEP SOSEVENTY PERSESTS I SO CAN IITSO CAV A A TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT IS WHAT AMYTHING YE TRIED VERIOUS ONES AND I COMPARE THE MATTRESSPACED ONE TO MAS YOU WORD ON MY ANCLE INSTEAD OF MY WRIST BUT UM AND I DO FIND IT IN FORMATIVE BUT E UM  COLIGO MIND AT STAMFORD ALLY CRUM AN WORKS ON MINE SEID IN BELIEF OF FACTSUM TAUCH ME ABOUT A STUDY THEY DID WHERE PEOPLE OFTEN WILL BUY US THERE SENSE OF DAYTIME WAKEFULNESS BASED ON THEIR SLEEP SCORE MORE THAN THEIR SUBJECTIVE YE SCORE Y IN OTHER WORDS IF THEY WERE TOLD THEY GOT A POOR NIGHT SLEEP EVEN IF THEY GOT A GREAT NIGHT SLEEP IN IN AND THIS WAS OF COURSE MEASURED IN THE SLEEP LAG A THEY'RE ABLE TO COMPARE PEOPLE REPORT FEELING MORE GROGGY AND THE OPPOSITE IS ALL SO TRUE ANDTD IF IT SAYS A HUNDRED PER CENT OR NINETY PER CENT ON YOUR SLEEP SCORE THE PEOPLE ALI FEEL GRADIATE THEY MIGH NOT HAVE SLEPT WELL SO THIS SPEAKS TO THE I DON'T SAY PLECEBLE IFFICT WIT THI SORT BELIEF EFFECTS EN AR WOVEN IN WITH A SCORE YE MANS SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT COMBINING SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE DATA YES PROBABLY YEAND I DO BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD TRUST YOUR OWN PHYSIOLOGY AND THE WAY THAT YOUR BODY IS TELLING YOU TO FEEL IM BECAUSE IN FACT IT USED TO BE THAT PEOPLE WITH INSIMNEA WEREN'T  ROFTEN NOT BELIEVED BECAUSE YOU PUT THEM IN A SLEEP LAB AND THEY LOOK LIKE THEY SLEPT GREAT AND YOU WAKE THEM UP IN THE MORNING THEY SAY I I DIDN'T SLEEP VERY WELL AT ALL AND THAT'S BECAUSE PROBABLY WE WE JUST CAME OUT WITH A PAPER THAT SHOWS THAT SUB CARTICAL STRUCTURES CAN BE IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SLEEP STATE THAN CORTICAL STRUCTURES AS WHICH IS WHAT WE MEASURE IN THE SLEEP LAB A WHAT THE CUARTEXES DOING SO IT MIGHT BE THAT PEOPLE WHO SAY I DID NOT SLEEP ALL NIGHT LONG EVEN THOUGH THE CUARTEX IS SAYING OH NO YOU HA GREAT SLEEP U WAS BECAUSE THEY'RE THERE MONITERING THEIR SOBE CARTICLE  HYPOTHALUMAS HYPICAMPUS A THALEMIS OTHER OTHER STRUCTURES THAT THE SLEEP LAB JUST CAN'T ACCESS UNLESS YOU HAVE DEPTH ELECTUR AN  WHICH NOBODY REALLY WANTS RIK AS THAT REQUIRES HOLES IN THE SKULLELLS AS NALIERS YEOUS I DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE LAST FIFTY PLUSS IYEARS OF SLEEP ON IT AM IT'S POTENTIALLY FLOD IN SOME WAY BECAUSE THEY'RE ONLY E RECORDING FROM AM I GUESSIS WOULD BE THE ANAWG YOU BE IT'S LIKE RECORING FROM ON THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN YA I SUPPOSE TO THE DEPTHS OF THE OCEIT AND TRYING TO ASCERTAIN THE LIFE MOVING DOUN DEEP IN THEDEPTH THE RACE YOURSELVES A COLLEAGUES THAT STAMFORD SLEEP LAVAND ELSEWHERE  BUT PLEASE JUST TELL USK AS I THINK SCIENTIST WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH YE I MEAN IT'S NOT FOR NOTHING THAT YOU WANTI KNOW WHAT THE CORTEXIS DOING A IN CORTEXIS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR A LOT OF THINGS BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY TELL YOU WHAT A LOT OF OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT PARTS THE BRAIN ARE DOING IN TERMS OF SLEEP AND AM BUT THERE'S HOPE A BECAUSE IN FACT IT WOULD BE GREAT I THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE FROM THE PAPER IF YOU LOOK AT IT IT'S IN PIANA AS THIS YEAR THIT YOU COULD DETECT SETTLE CHANGES IN THE CORTICAL E E G THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO TELL YOU WHAT THE SORTI SUB CATICAL STRUCTURES ARE DOING THINGS LIKE THE ABSOLUTE POWER OF IN THAT SLEEP SPINDLE BAND THAT SIGMA BAND WOULD CHANGE IF THE HIP THE CAMPUS IS IN REMSLEEP IN T E CARTEXES IN THAT SLEEP SPINDAL STATE AND ADVICE OFER ARE SO THERE IS SOME HOPE AND THAT WE CAN GAIN FROM PEOPLE WITH DEPTH ELECTREDS ERE ANIMALS AND WITH EPTH THELOCTREDS THAT WE COULD BACKWARDS A MACHINE LEARN WHAT THE CARTEXS MIGHT BE ABLE TO TELL US ABOUT SUBE CRTICAL STRUCTURES FROM THE CARTICAL EGY SO INTERESTING THES AMS IT A STIMULA ASTATEIN AS YOU MBE A STIMULUS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS ALWAYS GOING TO A ASSIST IN SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY AM THERE ONE MORE THING I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE NIGHT SLEE AM INTERMS OF EARLY PART OF THE NIGHT EARLIER YOU MENTION THE WASH OUT OF DEBRI AND UM THE SO CALL GLENPHATIC SYSTEM I THINK IS WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO YOU TE'LL SOL A BIT MORE ABOUT THE WASH OUT THAT OCCURS IN THE BRANGURING SLEEP WHAT WHAT THAT IS AND WHAT ROLES IT'S THOUGHT TO SIR AND PERHAPS IF THERRE ANY WAYS TO INSURE THAT IT HAPPENS OR TO INSURE THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN INOBVIOUSLY WE WANT THIS TO HAPPEN YE YE A IT GREAT QUESTION WE TALKED ABOUT THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK AND TOW CERTAIN THINGS HAPPEN AT CERTAIN TIMES WHILE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENS WHEN WE'RE WAKE AND TALKING TO EACH OTHER IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PLASTICITY ER SOMETHING THAT I AM LEARNING FROM YOU TO DAY AND YOU'RE LEARNING FROM ME AND THAT CHANGES OUR SENAPSES AND IT CHANGES THE WAY ARE PROTINES AR GOING TO BE FOLDED AND AND CHANGED DURING SLEEP AM IT UNFOLDS THIS PROCESS ACTUALLY USES A LOT OF EIG T P THE POWER A STRUCTURE THE FUEL OF THE BRAIN AND IT UNFOLDS ALSO PROTINES WHILE WE'RE DOING THIS WHILE WE'RE USING THEM AND SO DURING THAT FIRST PART OF THE NIGHT E WHEN WE FIRST FALL ASLEEP IN THE FIRST TWENTY MINUTES OR SO WE'RE BUILDING THAT A DENICINE BACK INTO EIH T P AND THAT'S A PROBABLY WY PAERANTS ARE CALLED PAWERANATS BECAUSE I WE'RE ACTUALLY REBUILDING THE POWER AND THEN AM WERE ALSO CLEANING OUT THROUGH THE DEEP SLOW WAVES OF SLAVE SLEEP CLEANING OUT ALL THOSE MISFOLDED PROTINES UNFOLDED PROTINES AND OTHER THINGS THAT GET BROKEN DOWN AND A YOU NOW NEED TO BE REBUILT WHEN WE'RE A SLEEP BECAUSE OF ITS US STERING WAKEFULNESS SO I LIKEIN THAT TOOU KNOW HAVING A BIG PARTY DURING WAKEFULNESS AND YOU NEED ALL THOSE PARTY GOERS TO LEAVE IN ORDER TO DO THE CLEAN UP AND SO WHAT I THINK THE MECHANISM IS AND THIS IS STILL SOMETHING BE TESTED IS ACTUALLY SLOW WAVES THEMSELVES WHICH IS BAD NEWS FOR US AS WE GET OLDER AND THOSE SLOWWAVES GET SMALLER AND A SLOWYSLEEP GOES AWAY SO UM SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A NURON IS FIRING IS THAT IT EXPANSE THE MEMBRANE EXPANDS A LITTLE BED BECOMES MORE TRANSLUCENT THAT'S HOW WE KNOW ONE OF THE RAYS WE KNOW THAT NARANS EXPAND WHEN THEY FIRE AND SO EVERY ACTION POTENTIAL ITHE MEMBRANE EXPANDS A LITTLE BIT AS SODIUM BRINGS WATER INTO THIS SO AM AND THEN WHEN THEY'RE SILENT THEY CONTRACT AND SO IN DURING SLOWWAVES THE COOL THING IS THAT THE REASON WHY YOU CAN MEASURE THEM IS HAT ALL THA NURANS AT THE SAME TIME NOT ALL OF THEM BUT A GOOD PORTION OF THEM ARE FIRING AT THE SAME TIME AND SILENT AT THE SAME TIME AND SO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT AS CONTRACTING AND EXPANDING ALL AT THE SAME TIME IT'S KIND OF LIKE A BUILGE PUMP OF THE BRAINS SO THAT CAN PUMP OUT CLEA ARE ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THIS A IN N TERNS OF CLEANING UP DEBRI AND TRANSFERRING IT TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO SO I'M SO I THINK OF IT ACTUALLY AS A BUILGE PUMP A CLEANING OUT OUR BRAIN INTERESTIN I'VE HEARD ABOUT THE GLEMPHATIC SYSTEM IN THEMPHATIC WASH OUT I'VE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THE MECHANICAL ASPECTS OF IT BEFORE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT FOR SOME REASON THAT NOW IT'S OBVIOUS TO ME THERE HAD TO BE SOMETHING MECHANICAL BUT ONLY KNOW THAT YOU' EDUCATE ME ABOUT THIS I THOUT THAT FOR SOME REASON THAT THE TREE RESPONDAL FLU OSTARTS WASHING THROUGH BUT HERE YOUR TALKING ABOUT LIRALLY AN EXPANSION AND A CONTRACTION OF THE NURANTS IN UNISON AND PUSHING THE FLUID THROUGH CLEANING OUT ANY MISFOLDED PROTINES OR TO BREATHE IT MIGHT OCCUR Y ON THE BASS OF THESE METABOLIC PATHWAYS AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS TO UP TO WHAT TO LEAVE THE BRAIN IN A SDATE OF A I MORE PRISTINE ACTION FOR FOR THE NEXT DAY YETR YE YOU THINK OF IT AGAIN LIKE A PARTY AND IF YO DON'T CLEAN UP AFTER THAT PARTY YOU TRY AND HOLD ANOTHER WHEN THE NEXT DAY IT'S GOING TO GET MORE CLUGGED IT US PEOPLE HAVE A HARDER TIME MOVING AROUND AND ENJOYING THEMSELVES AND AM IF THAT BUILLS OF DAY AFTER DAY AND IT'S GOING TO BE COGNITION THAT WOULD BE THE PARTY GOERS MOVING AROUND A BECOMES PARD AND SO THIS UN BUILG PUMP THAT YOU DESCRIBE S A SOCIY WITH THE S BIG SLOW WAVES OF OF UM DEEP WELL OF O SLOW WAVE SLEEP YE A SO THIES GOING TO CUR MORE LESS THAN THE FIRST THIRD OF THE NIGHT YES AT RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT AND AM ARE THERE THINGS THAT INHIBIT THIS PROCESS AND ARE THE THINGS THAT FACILITATE THIS PROCESS YA SO WHILE ON THING TOD IN HABIT ITS NOT TO GET IT THAT RIGHT AND HERE TO A SORRY ET IN TROUBLE AM BUT IT AND IS THIS SIMILAR TO THE CASE WITH GROWTHORMON WHERE IF YOU GO TO SLEEP LATER THAN YOU WOULD NORMALLY YOU MISS THE WASH OUT YE I'V DOIT'S NOT YOU DON'T DELAY IT A MISS YOU MISS THE WASH A RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT SO IF YOU GO TO SLEEP AT ONE OR TWO IN THE MORNING YOU SLEEP IS STILL GOING TO BE DOMINATED BY AND TWO AND REM SLEEP NOT BY SLOW WAVE SLEEP SO YOU NEED TO YOU NEED TO GET THAT FOR  IT SLEEP WOULD A COVY OUT TO THAT BE IF SOMEBODY NORMALLY GOES TO SLEEP AT ONE OR TWO A M AND WAKES UP AT TEN A M THAT IF THAT'S THEIR NORMAL SLEEP CYCLE YE AM THAT I SHOULD BE   IT SHOULD BE A A M YOU WOULD PROBABLY WANT TO TO SOMEBODY WOULD WANT TO DO A SLEEP STUDY WITH PEOPLE WHO DO THAT NORMALLY AND SEE IF ALSO THE MELATONA RELEASE IS LATER AND THE CRATICOSTERAN RISE THAT HAPPENS NORMALLY IN THE MORNING ALSO HAPPENS LATER SO IF EVERYTHING SHIFTED GOT  YE THER THERE A FEW STUDIES IV AM COME ACROSS THAT REALLY DO ARGUE FOR THE FACT THAT WAKING UP SIRK U SUNRISE THAT DOESN'T MEAN AT SUNRISE BUT WITHIN AN HOUR OR TWO MAY BE THREE HOURS OF SUNRISE AND GOING TO SLEEP WITHIN FOUR HOURS AFTER SUNSET OR SO ITSE AM IS ACTUALLY BETTER FOR THE HEALTH OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS THEN IS BEING A NIGHT OWL AND THE NIGHT OWL I'S ALMOST LIKE A  NIGHT OWLL POSSY OUT THERE THAIS FOR SHON SOCIAL MEDIA THEY GET VERY UPSET YWHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU SHOULD SEE MORNING SUNLIGHT THAT AFTER TN A M YOU CAN A MISS THE BOAT AN THEY GET VERY UPSET BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE PERHAPS WHO A WHO REALLY FEEL LIKE THE FUNCTION BETTER STAYING UP LATE AND WAKING UP LATE I FUNCTION MUCH LESS WELL WAKING UP EARLY IN GOING TO BED EARLY BUT THE DATO ON HEALTH MATRICS SUGGEST THAT SORRY NIGHT OWLS THAT THEY ARE WRONG YET SORRY ME CAUSE I'M THE NIGHT OO WH    A RER NOT A REALLY EARLY MORNING PERSON I'M GONTING MORE TIP IF I WAKE UP NATURALLY ROUND SIX THIRTY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SIX THIRTY AND SEVEND THIRTY A M GO TO SLEEP SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN AND ELEVEN Y M YE THESE ARE AVERAGES AM BUT I DO NOTICE THAT WHEN I FORCE MYSELF TO GET UPPL EARLIER AND GO TO SLEEP A LITTLE EARLIER THAT MY MOOD AND ALERTNESS AND JUST OVER ALL PRODUCTIVITY IS MUCH HIGHER THEN THERE CAUN BE OTHER VARIABLES ABSLEEP RIGHT I'M A NIGHT O I LOVE STAYING UP LATE AT NIGHT DOING WENNOW WRITING GRANTS WRITING PAPER IS WATCHING MOIS WHATEVER IT IS I LEVE IT THAT I I LIKE YOU AD LIKE EVERY HUMAN B EING ON EARTH ULD DO BETTER IF I GO TO BED EARLIER AND WAKE UP EARLIER SO ONE GOOD THING FOR A NIGHT OUS IS TO HAVE A CHILD BECAUSE THEY WILL WAKE UP THEIR CIRCADY AND RYTHMS ARE SO STRONG THEY WILL WAKE UP AND EVEN IF YOU DEPRIVE THEM OF SLEEP IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE NIGHT THEY WILL STILL WAKE UP LIKE CLOCK WORK BECAUSE THER ARE CIRCATIN RETHEM SARE SO STRONG AT SIX A M AN SO WHAT YOU YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING GOOD FOR YOUR KID YOU HAVEN'T MOVE THEIR CYCLE TO LATERS AND BE MORE IN LINE WITH YOURS IN FACT YOU'VE JUST SLEEP DEPRIVE THEM AND MADE THEM MISS A WINDOW AND MADE THEM CRANKY THE NEXT DAY AND MADE YOUR LIFE MORE MISERABLE SO GO TO BED A SOON AFTER YOUR KIDS GO TO BED AND WAKE UP WITH THEM THAT'S THE WAY TO DO IT GRAT THE CHILD ALARM CLOCK THERE ASN ATA CHILDREN YES A I GOT A DOG A PUFPY AN THEN THAT BECAME A DOG SPECIFICALLY WELL FOR MANY REASONS BUT ONE REASON WAS I WANTE TO BE ONE THIS EARLY MORNING ROSING A FIVE THIRTY A M EVERY MORNING BUT I AIN'T UP GETTING A BULL DOG THAT WOULD LITERALLY SLEEP SIXTEEN HOUR YE IF HE COULD A NEW CLEAR BALM COULD GO OF AND HE WOULDN'T WAKE UP BUT WHAT I STRARGE TO LEARN WAS THAT BULLDOGS A SHE O SLEEP AP NEOTHER THERE'S A IT'S FARS I KNOW THEG THE ONLY SPECIES THAT HAS A GUNETICALLY A THERE IS SIMTHING IN BRED AM SLEEP DY FAA AND SO I ISHHE DON'T ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET BULL DOGS BECAUSE IT'S A  KIND OF A CRUEL BREED THEY SUFFER A LOT IN THAT BODY THINTHER MORNING TO ANYWAY AM A DOG CAN ACCOMPLISH SOME SOME OF THIS WOULD GET THE GET THE A THE BREED OF DOG THAT THEY GOING TO WAKE UP EARLY  ANOTHERS DON'T GIN A BUL DIRAMASS WELL YOU KNOW INTERESTINGLY ALL OA PREDATORY ANIMALS LIKE DOGS AND CATS AND LANDS AND US AM WELL MORE DOGS CATS AND LIONS THEN AS WILL CAN SLEEP YEU KNOW SIXTEEN HOURS A DAY I FERRETS ARE PREDATORY THEY D A THAT FIR YS TU THAN A SADLY ALSO UED TO WORK ON FIRT YATIO NUMBER BABORS YI AD A LIAFUL ANIMALS YA AND GREAT BECAUSE YOU CAN STUDY DEVELOPMENT IT'S REALLY COOL AN BECAUSE THEY'RE BORN VERY ALTRICIAL LIKE WE ARE ITS BRAINS THAT ARE NOT VERY WELL DEVELOPED AND SEEP AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS THROUR DEVELOPMENT AND HOW IMPORTANT THESE DIFFERENT PHASES OF DEVELOPMENT REALLY ARE BUT YES AM YA MAYBE WE'RE NOT AS PREDITOR AS MUCH PREDITORS AS WE THANK  BECAUSE IN FACT WE ARE SLEEP IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE PRAY AND THE PREDITORS  A INTERNS THE AMOUNT OF SLEEP THAT WE USUALLY NEED A NIGHT A BUT THOSE PREDITORS CAN SLEEP SIXTEEN HOURS A NAPPING ALL DAY LONG AND AND THE MORE CROPUSCULAR PERHAPS LIKE THEIR PREY ARE MOS A DAWN AND YASK A IF YAD DON IN DUS ACTIVE AM YE BUT ANYWAY YES A CHILDREN AND DOGS ACTUALLY IN IF THERE WAS A PULL DONE BY THE NATIONAL SLEEP FOUNDATION TO SEE WHAT THE NUMBER ONE THING IS THAT WAKES PEOPLE UP AT NIGHT AND NUMBER TOO IS GOING TO THE BATHROOM A NUMBER THREE IS CHILDREN BECAUS A YOU KNOW YOU'RE WHEN YOUR CHILDREN ARE YOUNG BUT THAT ONLY LASTS A FEW YEARS THE WAKE YOU UP A WHEN THEI'R BABIES M THAT THE NUMBER ONE THINGS PETS AND PATS NEEDING TO GO OUT  OR CATS WANTING TO CURL UP WITH YOU OR WHATEVER IT IS PATS NEEDS WIL WAKE YOU UP MORE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THAN ANYTHING ELSE ANOTHER REASON DON NOT GET A NOCTURNAL PETS PEOPLE GET HAMPSTERS ALPRETTY QUICKLY REALIZE THAT THEY ARE NOCTURNAL MAN ON A RUN ON THE WHEEL AN AW I ET PE N THE LIVING ROOM AWAY FROM WHERE YOU SLEEP I VOTE FISH TEC FOLKS EAN FRESH WATERFISH TO THAT'LL WOT THE REASONS TO NOT GET US ALTWORD INK FRESH WATERFISH TO AM OR A CHILD EM I APPRECIATE THAT VOTE AND I PRECIATE YOU MENTIONING FERRETS AND BY THE WAY FOLKS THEY ARE CARNIVORS THEY ARE NOT RODANCS AND THEY ARE THEY HAVE VERY ELABORATE BRAIN STRUCTURES WE AITHER VERY SMART YE EM IN THE SAME FAMILY AS THE HONEY BADGERS AN THE OTHER MUSCULITS AY WR WILL IDI SHOULDN'T I GEAK OUT TOO MUCH ON ON THE MUSTELAS OR ELSE I TAKE THE THE REMAINDER OF ALL OUR TIME A LOVE FOR YOU TO TELL US ABOUT REM SLEEP IN THI SLEEP LATER IN THE NIGHT AS IT RELATES TO DREAMS AN EMOTIONALITY AND THIS IS PROBABLY ON THE APPROPRIATE TIME FOR YOU TO INTRODUCE US TO THIS INCREDIBLE STRUCTURE IN THE BRAIN WHICH IS THE LOCUST SERULIOUS  DIFFICULT OMSTRUCTURE TO SPELL BUT A BEAUTIFUL A BEAUTIFULLY NAMED STRUCTURE EM I FIND LOCUST RELEAS TO BE JUST FASCINATING AND I KNOW I WOU KNOW A SMALL FRACTION OF WHAT IT DOES AND I'M HOPING YOU'RE GOING TO EDUCATE ME IN AN OUR AUDIENCE ABOUT MORE BOUT WHAT IT DOES AND HOPEFULLY TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ITS RELATIONSHIP TO EPANEFERAN AK A DRENALIN YE IM SO GLAD YOU BROUGHT THIS OUT BECAUSE I CAN TOTALLY GEK OUT ON THE LOCUS ERELIST ES TO  LOCUS MEANING POT OR PLACE AND SRELIS MEING BLUSA COULD JUST CALL THE BLUE SPOT AM THAT'S THE EASIEST EVERY EM ANIMAL WITH HA BRAIN HAS A BLE SPOT AND EM YE AND I MEAN EVERY OTHER MA WITH THA BRAIN BECAUSE CHRIS THERE ARE ANIMALS WITH NERVOUS SYSTEMS THAT ARE NOT CENTRALIZED LIKE JELLYFISH M BAT ANYWAY WERE WERE DIGRESSING THERE SO AM THE LOCUST RELIST IS FILLED WITH NERANS THAT HAVE IN THEM NORUP IN EFFRIN WHICH IS THE BRAINS VERSION OF EPAN EFRAN OR A DRENALAN IS ALSO CALLED NORAH DRENALIN AND WHAT IT DOES IS IT JUST LIKE A DRENALIN AND THE REST OF OUR BODIES IT HELPS PRIM US TO RESPOND TO ORE ENVIRONMENT SO WHEN LOCUS RELIS NERANS FIRE AND FIR IN A BURST WE CAN SWITH OUR ATTENTION M AND THEY WILL FIRE IN A BURST IF FOR EXAMPLE A LOUD NOISE HAPPENS IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR CONCENTRATING ON SOMETHING SO YOU CAN IT HELPS IT FIRES AND IT HELPS YOU SWIT YOUR ATTENTION TO THAT THING AND THEN LEARN QUICKLY FROM IT SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IN A STRESS RESPONSE IT HELPS US DO QUICK ONE TRIAL LEARNING AND A MAN THEN TONIC ACTIVITY DURING THE DAY WHEN YOU'RE JUST YOU KNOW DOING U NORMAL GOING ABOUT YOUR NORMAL CONCENTRATION KIND OF ACTIVITY ACTIVITIES IS REALLY GOOD FOR AM SUSTAINED ATTENTION AM IT IT WORKS WITH THE COLANARGIC SYSTEM OF OUR B ASIL FOR BRAIN M WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR LEARNING AN MEMORY ALSO TO HELP US LEARN ABOUT THINGS AND PUT THINGS TOGETHER AM BUT JUSTONIC ALEVEL LEVELS ARE SIGNATURE OF WAKEFULNESS AND ALERTNESS SO TOO MUCH IS PANIC WITH HE LOCUSRILIS ACTIVITY A BURST IS SWITCHING ATTENTION AND THEN TONIC LEVELS AR SUSTAINED CONSTANT ATTENTION AND THEN WHEN WE GO TO SLEEP THE LOCUSTRIALIS SLOWS AND COM GOES FROM ABOUT ON AVERAGE A TO HURTS TO BOUT ONE HURTS ONE CYCHL FOR SECOND AMTONICALLY A AND THEN WHEN WE GOIN TO REMSLEEP IT'S THE ONLY TIME WHEN ITH SHUTS OFF COMPLETELY AND IT APPEARS AT THAT COMPLETE SILENCE IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT FOR A NUMBER OF THINGS AND THE MAIN THING THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR IS THE ABILITY TO ERACE AND BREAK DOWNSENAPSES THAT ARE NO LONGER WORKING FOR US O TAND COD THINGS THAT ARE FALSE NOW OR THEY ARE IN COTING THINGS THAT WE A LEARNED IN THE NOVELTY AND COTING PATHWAY S OF AR OF OUR BRAIN THAT HAVE NOW BEEN CONSOLIDATED OTHER PATHWAYS AND SO WE NEED TO NOWERACE THEM FROM THE NOVELTY AND COTING PATHWAY AND THAT IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT FOR BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE TO LEARN AM THINGS ALL OF OUR LIVES SO LIKE ERACING THAT RAM E OR THAT YEU NON'T KNOW WHAT HE CALL US DISKS THAT YOU STECK INTO COMPUTERS THAT'L A HOR DRA ANOA TUM DODIVES DAWDRO YOU'RE RASING YOUR THUMB DRIVES Y THAT THUMBDRIVES WHAT YOU CARRY AROUND ALL DAY LONG AND THEN DURING SLEEP YOU WRITE THAT THUMB DRIVE TO THE QORTEX TO THE LONGTER MEMORY  STRUCTURES AND YOU NEED TO REFRESH THAT THUM DRIVE AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS DURING REMSLEEP WHEN THE LOCUSTRILIS IS OFF BECAUSE WHENEVER IT'S ON AND NORA GENTLEAN IS THERE IT HELPS US TO PUT THINGS TOGETHER IT HELPS US TO LEARN AND STRENGTHEN SANAPSES BUT IT DOESNOT ALLOW US TO ACTUALLY WEAKEN SENAPSES THAT ARE ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT PART FOR LIFE A PORTANT PART OF LIFELONG LEARNING A YE I SO MUCH MORE I COULD SAY ABOUT THAT YO YOU'L CUST RULIOS O TFASCINATING SO IT'S CONDECTED TO THE BASIL FOR RINCOLIN ERGI SISTEM A THE NERONSY LOCUS RULIIS FOR NOT MISTAKIN RELEASE NOR ON ENOUGH FR PERHAPS UP ENOGH FOR NIS WOLL AWELL NO THE BRAINS VERSION OF EPONEFFON IS NORAPENEFFREN M THE OTHER THING IT ALSO THE PRECURSER T NORPENEFFRON IS DOPEMINE AND SO THE SOURCE OF DOPEMINE AND E HYPPOCAMPUS SEEMS TO BE THE LOCUSTRIALIS AND ITS STILL A MYSTERY IS UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS THE LOCUSTRIALS ALSO RELEASES DOPEMING BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE'RE LEARNING SOMETHING NEW TO ALSO RELEAST OPEMINE OR TO AT LEAST ACTIVATE THE DOPEMEN ARGIC RECEPTORS IN OUR HYPPOCAMP IS SO YE SO DOPAMINE NORPENEFFREN A AND THEN THERE'S ALSO A GALLANIN WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR RELEASE WON RESTRESSED AND AT HELPES ALSO WITH OUT RAPID LEARNING AM IT WORKS IN CONCERT WITH NORP AN EFFREN AND IN DOING WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO TO STRENGTHEN SYNAPSES SO THAT WE LEARN RARELY QUICKLY I I LOVE AM THAT THEIRE MULTIPLE MOLECULES INVOLVED BECAUSE THAT SIGNALS US TO A PRINCIPLE WHICH IS THAT EVEN IF PEOPLE CAN'T REMEMBER OUR ALL THE NAMES UM THAT RARELY IN BIOLOGY IS SOMETHING HANDLED BY JUST ONE MOLECULAR PATHWAY THAT WE DONANCY IS THE RULE PIA BECAUSE SIGNALING ATTENTION TO SPECIFIC EVENTS I SO IMPORTANT SO THAT UM OMANY USE THAT IS A JUST SO STORY ALWE SAY I WASN'T CONSULTED OF THE DESIGN FASE BUT IT MAKES SENSE TO ME AS TO WY REDUNDAN SEE WHAT EXIST IN THAT A SOENTLY AND IN FACT WHEN WE FORM HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE BRAIN WE'RE ALWAYS WRONG AND THE REASON WHY WE'RE ALWAYS WRONG IS CAUSE ITS MORE COMPLICATED THAN WE LIKE TO THINK AND BECAUSE IN OUR BRAINS FRON REFORMING HYPOTHESES ITS WE FAIL TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL OF THE FACTORS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN OF THE GLEA THE NEROPEPTIDES IN OUR TRANSMITTERS THE PHYSICAL STRUCTUREOF SYNAPSES AND SO WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH GRAD SCHOOL THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO I WE THE DOGMOENS THAT EVERY NERON CONTAINS ONE NER TRANSMITTER AND RELEASES ONE NER TRANSMITTER AND YOU HAD EXCITETORAVE NOUR TRANSMITTERS AND INHIVITORY NARO TRANSMTTERS AND R MODULATORY NER TRANSMITRS BUT THAT'S ATS COMPLICATES GOT AND THEN WE FOUT STRAD POCKAMOUT NOR PEPTIDES AND PEOPLE SAIT O NO PLEASE DON'T DON'T COMPLICATE AND THEN WE START TALKING ABOUT HOW I NERONS CONTAIN BOTH NER PEPTIDES AND NER TRANSMITTERS AND MAY BE MORE THAN ONE NER TIMES MAYR EVEN HOREMONS TON HORMONS AND O LORD OU KNO IT'S JUST SO COMPLICATED BUT GOD ADMIT THAT'S WHY IT WORKS RIGHT AND EVERY TIME THE BRAIN TEACHES US SOMETHING NEW ABOUT ITSELF THAT WE DIDN'T HYPOTHESIZE WE SAY ALL OF COURSE THAT WOULDN'T WORK IF THE WAY I HAPOTHESIZED IT WITH IT IN WE ACTUALLY NEED REDUNDANCE WE NEED ALL THESE SYSTEMS TO WORK TOGETHER AND SO IT'S A DAUNTING SOMETIMES BUT IT ALSO ENSURES MANY A MANY CAREERS AND SAW IT H AN EROSCIENCE IN PARTICULAR SO AM A NOTE THAT ASPIRING SCIENTISTS THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM A FOR DISCOVERY IF YOU WANT ME TO TALK ABOT NOR AINEFRAN YE SAME INOTION YES HAT I LOOK AT WOULD HAVE LOVE FOR YOU TO UM TELLS ABOUT IS YOU KNOW WHAT ROLE THIS LACK OF NOR UP AN EFFERAN RELEASE TURING RAPIDIE MOVEMENT SLEEP AM IS THOUGHT TO ACHIEVE AND MAYBE COULD ALSO REVUSE SOME OF YOUR WORK DESCRIBING CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH NOR UP INN EFRAN INVADES YAN VA RAPIDIE MOEMENT SLEEP INOTHER PATTERNS OF SLEEP AND HOW THAT CAN BE DETRIMINE YE SO A LOT OF THIS IS HYPOTHETICAL THAT BASED ON A LOT OF GOOD EVIDENCE THAT WE'RE SEWING TOGETHER INTO THE SCHEMA FROM WHICH THESE HYPOTHESES COUNT ASSO A MODEL ON SCHEME UP FROM ITS CACE HYPOTHESES COME BUT ONE THING THAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE WITH POSTROMATIC STRESS DISORDER IS THAT THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT THE LOCUSTERIALISTS DOESN'T STOP FIRING IN RENSLEEP SO WHEREAS THER ER LEVELS OF NORPAN EFREND MIGHT BE SIMILAR TO PEOPLE WITHOUT PTST DURING THE DAY AND EVEN DURING THE FIRST PART OF THE NIGHT A DURING THE WE HOURS OF THE MORNING AND WHEN YOU MEASURE NORPANEFRAN LEVELS FROM METABOLITES A IN THE BLOOD OR THE  TREE WIL SPINAL FLUID YOU SEE THAT PEOPLE WITH PTST IT'S DURING THE WE HOURS OF THE MORNING WHEN YOU HAVE THE MOST REM SLEEP THEY HAVE THERE NORPANEFRAN LEVELS DIFFERENTIATE MOST FROM THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE PTST AND SO THAT'S EVIDENCE THE LOCUSTRILS IS NOT SHUTTING DOWN DURING REM SLEEP LIKE IT SHOULD OTHER EVIDENCE IS HEART RATE VARIABILITY WHEN OUR LOCUSTRILIS IS FIRING A OUR HEART RATES AR GENERALLY A LITTLE HIGHER AND THEY DON'T VARY AS MUCH AS THEY DO WHEN THE LOCUSTRILIS IS NOT FIRING SO DURING SLOWIVE SLEEP NOR WE HAVE THIS BIG GUCY VARIABILITY AN HEART RATE WITH EVERY BREATH IN AND BREATH OUT BECAUSE OUR NORADENERGIC LEVELS OURE NORPAN EFREN LEVELS ARE LOWER DURING REM SLEEP THAT GOES AWAY ENTIRELY IN OUR HEART RATIS IS EM IS A DOMINATED BY A PARA SYMPATHETIC RATHER THAN SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY AND ALSO WHAT OUR BRAIN IS DRIVING IN WHAT OR DREAMING ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE FOR DREAMING WERE RENNING OUR HEART RATES WILL GO UP BUT NORPANEFREN LEVELS STILL SHOULD BE LOW OR OFF SO A PEOPLE WITH P TST THAT NORA DENERGICS A WE'RE STUDING THESE AN RATS TO IS IT TRUE THAT OUR LOCUSTRILIS DOESN'T A SHUT OFF WHEN WE HAVE POSTRAMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE IS YES IT'S TRUE THAT IT DOESN'T SHUT OFF SO WHAT THAT WOULD DO IS A NORPANEFREN WOULD ACT AT SYNAPS IS TO PREVENT THAT A WEAKENING THAT YOU REALLY NEED FOR EXAMPLE OF NOVELTY AND COTING STRUCTURES AND IT KEEPS MEMORIES IN THAT NOVELTY INCODING STRUCTURE EVEN ONCE IT'S CONSOLIDATED TO THE REST OF THE BRAIN SO IN THE HYPPOCAMPUS WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR REMEMBERING THINGS THROUGHOUT OUR LIVES AND AND IT'S THAT THOM DRIVE A WE WE NEED IT TO BE EURACE SO THAT WE CAN LEARN NEW THINGS A ONCE IT'S BEEN CONSOLIDATED TO THE THE HARD DRIVE OF OUR QUARTEX AND IF SO IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT WE FILL UP THAT RAM A REALLY QUICKLY OR THAT THUMDRIVE REALLY QUICKLY AND WE'NE NOT ABLE TO LEARN NEW THINGS SOFER EXAMPLE AFTER A TRAMA I TALKEDTO ALL THE LOCUSTRILLIS RESPONDING IN STRESSFUL SITUATIONS THAT'S GREAT IT'S VERY ADAPTIVE BUT THEN YOU NEED IT TO STOP ONCE YOU'VE LEARNED WHAT YOU NEED TO LEARN FROM IT AND YOU WANT TO GO TO SLEEP YOU NEED THE LOCUSTRILUS TO CALM DOWN AND DURING REMSLEEP YOU WANTIT TO STOP BECAUSE THEN WHEN YOU'VE CONSOLIDATED THAT TRAMATIC MEMORY TO THE QUARTEXS YOU NEED TO ERACE IT FROM THE NOVELTY AND COTING STRUCTURES FOR EXAMPLE IN THE HYPPOCAMPUS SO THAT THEN WHEN YOU'RE IN THE CONTEXT OF SAFETY YOU CAN LEARN THOSE NEW THINGS WAS NEW CONTEX AND A AND STOP RESPONDING TO THOSE SAME STIMULI AS THOUGH YOUERE IN THAT ORIGINAL TUATION SO YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO YOURACE THAT THEM DRIVE YOU WILL ALWAYS FEEL LIKE THAT TRAMA HAPPENED THAT SAME DAY MIGHT EARLIER THAT SAME DAY AND A RESPOND AS YOU WOULD TO E A AN EARLY A RECENT TRAMA WHICH IS WITH BEATING HEART AND ALL OF THAT AM SO EVEN MEMORIES THAT ERE YEARS PAST IF YOU ARE NEVER ABLE TO DOWNSCALE THAT NOVELTY IN COTING STRUCTURE AND PURGE IT FROM THAT TRAMATIC MEMORY IT WILL STAY FRESH AND NEW AND THEN BECOME MALADAPTIVE WHAT APPROACHIS ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT CAN A TURN DOWN THE OUTPUT OF LOCUS SRULIAS DURING THESE PHASES OF SLEEP AND FOR THAT MATTER WHAT THINGS CAN CAUSE RAMPING UP OF LOCUSRULIAS DURING THIS PHAS OF SLEEP WE'VE HAD A COUPLE PODCAST EPISODE SOL EPISODES AND WITH GUESTS TALKING ABOUT TRAMA WE HAD DOCTOR PALCONTI WHOS ISDAMFORTRAINED HAVERTRAN AMPSYCHITRES YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT TRAMA WROTE AN EXCELLENT BOOK ON TRAMA AND AM YCERTAINLY SLEEP WAS EMPHASIZED AS AS A KEY THING LIKE GET ENOUGH SLEEP UT HER YOUR SAYING EVEN IF SOMEBODY WHICH RAMA GETS ENOUGH SLEEP IF LOCUSRULIOS IS HYPERACTIDE DURING SLEEP ITAS TRAMAS ARE GOING TO PERSISTIN MOST OF THE TRAMA TREATMENTS THAT I AM AWARE OF OR EVERYTHING RANGING FROM CONO BEHAVIOUR ILL THERE A BE TALK THERE BE DRUGG THERE BE EMDY AR HYPNOSIS AM NOWDIES THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST AN ATTENTION ON AM CLENICAL STUDIES ON EXPLORNING PSYCHODELICS HIDO SYLICIDE AN AN EMTY AMAY SO THAT'S A VAST LANDSCAPE  NONE OF WHICH AS FAR AS I KNOW IS REALLY FOCUST ON SLEEP SPECIFIC WELL THEY'RE NOT AND THEY SHOULD BE BECAUSE ACTUALLY PSYCHODELICS IS A SLEEP LIKE STATE AND ASA REM SLEEP LIKE STATE ALTHOUGH OF COURSE THERE IS SOME MAJOR DIFFERENCES SO YES SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT HERE SO ANTI DEPRESSENCE A ARE OFTEN NOR ADERNERGIC AR SERITINAR JIC RE UPTAKE INHIBITERS SO THEY LEAVE NORPANEFFRAN ACUALLY OUT THERE IN THE SANAPSES AND WHAT THAT DOES IS IT INHIBITS REM SLEEP A AND IF YOU ARE ABLE TO GET REM SLEEP IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ROM SLEEP WITH SOME NARGINERGIC ACTIVITIES SO ACTUALLY I THINK ANYWAY AM NOT A PHYSICIAN THAT A ANTI TO PRESENTS ARE COUNTER INDICATED YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE THEM IF YOU O EXPERIENCED TO TRAMA AND YOURNCE EXPERIENCE IN PETIOSTY BECAUSE IF ANYTHING IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT WORSE OR AT LEAST PREVENT THE TYPE OF THE DAPT IV REM SLEEP THAT YOU REALLY NEED AN ORDER TO RESOLVE THOSE EMOTIONS AND MOVE ON AM IS THAT STATEMENT SPECIFIC TO INTO DEPRESSENCE THAT A TICKLE THE NORATRONERGIC PATHWAYS SO THAT THE ONE THAT COMES TO MIND IS AMPREPRIBE OR CAN NEVER PRONOUNCE A BRU POPRIOR ON WHICH IS A WHAT UT THINK BRANDAME AS WELL BEUTRAN IT'S A DOPEOF MIN ERGIC AND NORATRONERGIC AGONIST S SUVE THES THE NAT EFFECT AS OPPOSED TO THE PROSE AXOL OFTERITY WHICH OUR ACCESS OR EYES YES YES BUT AS AS AREYES THEMSELVES ALSO ARE PROB MATTAR BECAUSE WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT YET THAT THE DORUSAL RAPHE NEWCLAS WHICH PRODUCES SARATONEAN WHICH THE THE PA CIFIC SARATON IS TOCIFIC SARATONE AN REAPTIC INIVITERS BLOCK FROM BEING REAPTAKEN AM LEAVES TOO MUCH SARATON ANOUT THERE AND WHAT SARATONAN ALSO IS ANOTHER NORDRONERGIC ADISID NOTHER NOR AHANCEMENTER THAT'S DOWN REGULATED DURING REMSLEEP THAT SPECIFICALLY OFF DURING REMSLEEP AND WHAT SARATONAN DAS IS IT WAITS ALL OF OUR COGNITION TO BEING ABLE TO RECOGNIZE NOVELTY AGAIN SO IT SORT OF WAITS A OUR BRAIN AWAY FROM A SENSE OF FAMILIARITY AND TOWARD NOVELTY AND AM A MIGH BE ONE REASON WHY ITS AN EFFECTIVE A BANTE TO PRESENT BECAUSE IT MAKES THE WORLD FEEL FRESH AND NEW AGAIN RIHT AM BUT YOUWHEN YOU HAVE TOO MUCH YOUR HOLDING A NOVEL TRAMATIC MEMORY AM IN YOUR NOVELTY AN CUTTING STRUCTURE TOO STRONGLY ALREADY YOU DON'T WANT TO AGAIN WAIT THINGS TOWARD NOVELTY YOU NEED THAT ABSENCE OF SERATONAN ALSO TO HELP YOU GET THAT SENSE OF FAMILIARITY AND TO START ERASING THE NOVELTY AND COUD INSTRUCTURES SO YOU NEED BOTH TO BE ABSENT ITS TRULY INTERESTING A WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT SRATONE AND AND A IT'S NOT OFTEN DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF ITS FEATURES RELATED TO NOVELTY ENOUGH I THINK A AND WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBE ACCUSE ME TO SOMETHING THAT A DOCTOR PAULCONTI AND OTHERS AVE HAVE SAID IN TERMS OF TRAMAND HERE IN PERAPHRASING TO MY APOLOGIES TO THEM FOR NOT GETTING IS EXACTLY RIGHT THAT THAT AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR TRAMA DOES NOT ERACE THE TRAMATIC MEMORY BUT IT CAUSES A TRANSITION OF WHAT ONCE WAS DISTURBING AND INVASIVE AN MALADAPTIVE TO EVENTUALLY JUST BECOME KIND OF ABORING OLD STORY THAT HAS KIND OF A FUZZY TEXTURE TO IT AS OPPOSED TO THIS KIND OF SHARP A HIGH FRICTION TEXTURE THAT INVADES OUR THINKING O ADAM AND OBVIOUSLY OUR SLEEPING STATES AS WELL SO A AGAIN AN A I APPRECIATE THE DISCLAIMER THE COVIOTS AROUND IU O NOT BEING ACCLINITION AT CETERA BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST NOW AND WHETHER OR NOT ENTID TO PRESENCE ARE EFFECTIVE FOR TRAMA OR NOT I THIN THESE THESE ASPECTS OF NERMODULATION AS THEY RELATE TO AM IT'S CALL IT ERACING TRAMAS ARE CHANGING THE EMOTIONAL LOAD OF TRAMAS DURING SLEEP A MI SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO TAKE NOTE WE ALL HAVE A LOTIC CLINITIONS THAT LISTENED OT IS PODCASTI THEY SHOULD ALSO TAKE NOTE AM PLEASE SO IF I WANT TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF NOR UP ANEFFRAN RELEASE FROM LOCUS SERULIAS DURING RAPANI MOVEMENT SLEEP TO ELIMINATE THE TROUBLING OR MAYBEVEN TRAMATIC MEMORIES AM AND ALLOW LAT STAGES OF SLEEPEA TO NIGHT TO HAVE THEIR MAXIMUM POSITIVE EFFECT IS THERE ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO BESIDES AVOIDING AM AVOAITING TRAMAS AVOID ING AM CERTON URGIKON OR RAGERN URGE COMPET WELL I WOULD ALSO AVOID ANYTHING JUST PRIOR TO GOING TO SLEEP THAT MIGHT EXCITE THOSE SYSTEMS SO A LOT OF NOVELTY AM A LOT OF YOU KNOW EXCITING A STRESS IN DUCING VIDIO GAMES A TRY AND ENTER SLEEP WITH AS MUCH CALM AS YOU CAN SO MAY BE DEEP BREATHING EXERCISES THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL WAY TO CALM YOUR SYMPATHETIC FITERFLIGHT SYSTEM IS DEEP BREATHING AND A WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO TEST US WITH RATS BECAUSE WE CAN'T ASK THEM TO DO A DEEP BREATHING EXERCISE A THERE MIGHT BE AWAY WE CAN DO THAT BUT I HAVEN'T FOUND OUT OR FIGURED ATOUT YET AM BUT IF THERE'S A WAY YOU CAN MAKE YOUR SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM NERVOUS SYSTEM CALM DOWN BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP MIGHT FREE FOR YOU MEDITATION OR DEEP BREATHING EXERCISES MIGHT BE FOR SOME A WARM BATH OR COMFORTING BOOK NOTHING TO EXCITING TUT A ALSO NOTHING TOO BORING PERHAPS A JUST SOMETHING RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE WHICH MAKES YOU FEEL HAPPY AN CALM IS WHAT SHE SHOULD DO AND IF YOU INSTEAD GO TO SLEEP WHILE YOU'RE ANXIOUS OR A YOU'RE PIPED UP THEN YOUR SLEEP COULD BECOME MALADAPTIVE AM ANOTHER THING THAT HAPPENS IN RATS THAT WE HAVE YET TO KNOW IF IT HAPPENS IN WOMEN IS THAT FEMALE RATS HAVE A THREE PHASES OF THEIR ESTRA CYCLE THAT A THEIR LOCUSTRILIS DOESN'T SEEM TO CALM DOWN DURING REN SLEEP AS MUCH AND WE DON'T KNOW WHY BUT DURING THE HIGH ESTERGEN PHASES OF THER ESTRA CYCLE THE LOCUSTRILIS SHUTS DOWN JUST LIKE A DOZEN MALE RATS BUT IN THE OTHER THREE PHASES IT DOESN'T SO A ONE THING THAT MIGHT WORK AND IN FACT THERE ARE FEW STUDIES THAT SHOW IT IT COULD WORK REALLY WELL IS A A GIVING WOMEN AFTER A DRAMA EVENT A SOMETHING THAT CONTAINS ESTEROGEN BECAUSE ESTEROGEN SOMEHOW IS PROTECTIVE AGAINST PT ST AND THEY KNOW THAT THROUGH YOUR RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES WHERE THEY A GAVE WOMEN IN EMERGENCY ROOM EITHER A PILL WITH ESTEROGEN AND OR WITHOUT AND THOSE THAT HAD PILL WITH ESTERGEN IN IT WERE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO GET PT S T FROM THAT DRAMA AS MEASURED A YEAR LATER THAN THOSE THAT HAD THE PILL WITHOUT SO A THERE'S REALLY GOOD STUDIES BY BRON WHEN GRAHAM SHE'S OUT OF AUSTRALIA TO REALLY HONE IN ON HOW MUCH ESTERGEN DO YOU NEED AND ALSO TESTASTERAN JUST SO YOU KNOW GETS CONVERTED TO ESTERGEN IN THE BRAIN SO TO STASTERAN ALSO CAN BE PROTECTIVE BECAUSE IT GETS CONVERTED TO ESTEROGEN A BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT ESTERGEN THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL AND PROTECTIVE ABOUT A THAT FRAM FROM THE HIGH LOCUSERILLAS FIRING AND THIS IS AGAIN PRELIMINARY DATEITHER WE DON'T HAVE FULL HEY DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS YET AND A WE ARE LOOKING INTO ACTIVELY RIGHT NOW BUT ITS OF REALLY IMPORTANT THE OTHER THING ABOUT WOMEN IS THAT WE ARE TWO TO FOUR TIMES MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ANXIETY RELATED MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS INCLUDING POSTRAMATIC STRESS DISORDER SO IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO H LOCUSEREOSDURING SLEEP IN WOMEN A THAT AND THEN FIGURE OUT AWAY TO NORMALIZE THAT SO THE LOCUSTRIALUS IS SILENT WHEN IT NEEDS TO BE SILENT I THINK WE COULD GO A LONG WAY AND IN HELPING WOMEN BE MORE RESILIENT TO STRESTRULATED AND  DISORDERS WHAT OR SOME OTHER A SEX DIFFERENCEES AS THEY RELATE TO SLEEP YET YET THAT'S TA FERTHY GOOD QUESTION THERE HAVE BEEN VERY FEW STUDYS UNFORTUNATELY AOF WOMEN IN SLEEP A WOMEN AND ESTRA CYCLE OR MINSTRUAL CYCLE AND SLEEP AND A BAT WHAT WE HAVE FOUND WHICH ACTUALLY LARGELY REPLICATED A STUDY IN NINETEEN SIXTY A IS THAT THAT WOMEN OR FEMALES RATHER AT HIGH ESTRAGE AND HIGH HARMONA PHASES OF THEIR ESTRA CYCLE OR MINSTRUAL CYCLE SLEEP A LOT LESS BUT THAT SLEEP IS MORE EFFICIENT SO THAT SLEEP IS MORE DENSE IN THOSE SLEEP SPINDLES WHICH I HAVEN'T GONE INTO WHAT THEY MIGHT DO EXCEPT THIS CONNECTION BETWEEN THE HYPPOCAPS AND CUTECS BUT AS THOSE SLEEP SPINDLES ARE MORE DENSE AND MORE COHERENT ACROSS THE BRAIN AREAS THE FADE A CYCLE WHICH IS FIVE TO TEN HURTS IN THE HYPPOCAMPUS IMPORTANT FOR ONE YOUR LEARNING AND ALSO IMPORTANT DURING REM SLEEP IS ALSO BIGGER AND DUICIER A DURING THE HIGH HERMONA PHASES SO EVEN THOUGH THERE'S LESS SLEEP IT'S MORE EFFICIENT AND BETTER A BAT A SO SO ALL OF THAT EFFICIENCYSEEMS TO BE REDUCED IN THOSE OTHER HARMONAL PHASES A SO EVEN THOUGH YOU MIGHT SLEEP A LITTLE MORE A YOU MIGHT NEED MORE SLEEP IN FACT IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME THING THAT YOU CAN GET WITH THAT SHORT A VERY EFFICIENT SLEEP OF HYFOMONAL PHASES VERY INTERESTING I THINK EM THERE'S A GROWING TREND AT LEAST AMON A AN A FONDED GRANTS TO A REQUIRE A THAT A AS THEY REFER TO IT IN THE GRANDS BIOLOGICAL SEXES AVARIABLE YES AND THI  HERE WE TAUGHT NOTING ABOUT SEX THE A THE VER ALTHOUGH I'M SURE THEIR STUDIES ABOUT THAT TOO BUT BIOLOGICAL SEXIS AVARIABLE BECAUSE THERE'S A DURTH OF STUDIES EXPLORING SEX DIFFERENCES AND IN MOST EVERYTHING AN THERS THERE ALL SORS OF REASONS FOR THAT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE FORTUNATELY THE TREND IS SHIFTING YET A AND EVEN WHEN YOU STUDY MALESTRECES FEMALES A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST SAY INCLUDE FEMALES IN THEIR STUDIES BUT THAN DON'T TRACT THE ESTRA CYCLE OR MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND HARMONS HAVE HUGE EFFECTS ON OUR BEHAVIOUR I MEAN JUST THINK OF OYOUSHEAD SEX A YOU KNOW BEFORE OUR HARMONS COME IN WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN IT AND SUDDENLY YOU KNOW THAT'S AND OF A MAIN DRIVER OR BEHAVIORS HARMONS A CAN DEFINITELY CHANGE WHOE ARE IN WHAT WE DO SO WE S OULD BE STUDYING HARMONS NOT CO SEX I ALWAYS SAY THAT A PUBRTY IS PERHAPS THE MOST MASSIVE TRANSFORMATION AND RATE OF AGING THAT ANY OF US GO THROUGH AN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME AN INDIVIDUAL THEIR COGNITION CHANGES THEIR WORLD O OUCHANGES AND THAT'S LARGELY HORMONON DRIVENAND AND OBVIOUSLY NORAL ARCHITECTURES CHANGE TO AM AN VERY HAPPY THAT YOU MENTION I'M TRYING TO GET INTO CALMER STATES PRIOR TO SLEEP AND SOME WAYS TO DO THAT I'M A BIG FAN ENOUGH TALKED A LOT BEFORE IN THIS POD CAST ABOUT THINGS LIKE YOGANEDRA WHICH IS A NON MOVEMENT BASE PRACTICE A SOMETIMES CALLED NON SLEEP DEEPRESSE WHERE PEOPLE ACHLY TAKE SOME TIME EACH DATE TO PRACTICE HOW TO GO INTO A MORE PARI SYMPATHETIC AN A RELAXEIDATE DELIBERATELY IS ITS A BIT OF A SKILL YEYE IT'S AM AN THERE'S THERE'S SOME GOOD DATA REALLY MOSTY OUTAF E LABORATORY AND SCANANAVIA SHOWING HUGE INCREASES IN AM NI GROSTRIDE OLD DOPAMEN UM WHEN PEOPLE GO A BASELY ENGAGE IN A PRACTICE OF DELIBERATE A NON MOVEMENT AND THAT THE BRAIN ACTUALLY ENTER STATES OF A VERY SHALLOW SLEEP SO SSORT OF NNAPISH BUT THE IDEAS DAW SHE STAY AWAKE BUT MOTIONLESS AND IT DOES SEEM TO RESTORE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF FEATURES OF NERW CHEMISTRY BUT PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY IT TEACHES PEOPLE TO TO RELAX WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT VERY GOOD AT A A BUT IN ANY EVENT AM AND PEOPLE WHO LISTEN IS POTICE HAVE HEARD ME SAT AS OVER AND OVER AGAINS FI SAW LIKE A BROKEND RECORD BUT THIS PRACTICE AS A ZERO COST PRACTICE THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY A PHARMACOLOGY DOES SEEM TO REALLY ENHANCE PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO FALL ASLEEP MORE QUICKLY AND TO FALL BACK TO SLEEP IF THEY WIN OND THE TON HE NIGHT SO IN ANY OUT ANOTHER PLUG FOR ANYSTY ARE YOGANEDRA WELL I JUST ALSO WEN I ADD TO THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IN SOME  IS SO INCIDIAS IS BECAUSE ON PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN ENOUGH SLEEP AND OR GETTING OP SLEEP AND BECOME ANXIOUS ABOUT GETTNG UP SLEEP AND THEN YOU'RE ANXIOUS BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP LIKE I'M NOK ENOUGH FALLSLEEV US CAN BE FORTY FIVE MINUTES AND AND THEN THATSA POSITIVE FEET BACKLY SO YOU NEED TO BREAK THAT LYP SAY O K MY BODY'S GOING TO GET AS MUCH SLEEP AS AT NEEDS I NEEDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT AND THEN PRACTISE THIS RELAXATION TO SAY ATES IT'S ALLOKA IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT AND AND THEN CONCENTRATE ON THINGS THAT RELAX YOU A WETHER IT'S CONCENTRATING OR NOT CONCENTRATING WHATEVER IT IS AM YOU MET MENTIONED AM YOGANEDRA AND THAT REMINDED ME OF A TRANSINTENTAL MEDITATION WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT ALSO HASN'T BEEN STUDIED WELL I LIGELY BECAUSE WE CAN'T ASK NON HUMAN ANIMALS TO DO IT AND SO WE DON'T KNOW WAT'S HAPPENING WITH OUR NARROW CHEMISTRY AND A A BRAIN ACTIVITY IT IN A DEEP AN MEANINGFUL WAY BAT ONE THING THAT HIS HAS BEEN SHOWN IN THOSE IT CAN DO IT REALLY WELL IS THAT THAT THATA ACTIVITY THAT HE SAID HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE LEARNING SOMETHING OR WE YOU'RE IN RAMSLEEP IT IT'S WELL ESTABLISHED AND AND INCREASES DURING THE TRANSCENDENTOMAGITATION SO IT MIGHT BE THAT SOME STATES OF MEDITATION COULD IN SOME WAYS REREPLACE OR MEMIC SOME FUNCTIONS OF FOR EXAMPLE FREM SLEEP BUT AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW IF ALL THE NARCANMISTRY IS RIGHT TO DO FOR EXAMPLE THE THING THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS YOU RASING THE NOVELTY AND CUT INSTRUCTURES OF THE RAIN THAT NEEDS AN ABSENCE OF NARP AN EFFREN AND SERATONAN WHICH WE DON'T KNOW THAT GOES AWAY WITH WITH THEM TRANS INDENTAL MEDITATION WE JUST DON'T KNOW ANSWERED NOT YET YET THE STUDIES ON AN YOGANEDRA AND SLEEP REPLACEMENT OR KIND OF INTERESTING UM IT DOES SEEM TO BE THE CASE THAT NOTHING CAN REALLY REPLACE SLEEP EXCEPT SLEEP BUT THAT IF ONE IS SLEEP DEPRIVED OR IS HAVING TROUBLE FALLING BACK TO SLEEP THAT THESE UM THINGS LIKE AND I HEAR IT'S I ACKNOWLEDGE THIS IS ESSENTILLY LIKE YOGANEDRA BUT WE NOW CALL IT NON SLEEPDY BREAST OR AN ESTY ARE BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES FOR I A NAMES LIKE YOGANEDRA ACT AS AT KIND OF A BARRIER FOR O WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE A PEOPLE WILLING TO TRY A PRACTISE A SOUND AN I SAGL AND AND YE A SOUNDS LIFE LYING CARPETS AND  W YOU NOT SOUND LIKE YOU HAVE TO GO TO ESCLEN BY THE WAY ESCELLENCE A BEAUTIFUL PLACE BUT IT SELLS YOU HAVE TO GO THERE OR OR LIVE IN THE WEST COAST AT TO BELIEVE IN THE STUFF BUT IT SIMPLY NOT THE CASE THES ARE PRACTICES THAT THAT ARE REALLY JUST UMSELF DIRECTED RELACTATION AS A PRACTICE THAT THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO GET BETTER AND BETTER AT DIRECTING THEIR BRAIN STATES TOWARDS MORE RELAXATION AND MOST PEOPLE HAVE ANY SYMMETRY LIKE FOR INSTANCE MOST PEOPLE CAN FORCE THEMSELVES TO SAY UP LATER BUT THEY HAVE A HARTS I'M GOING TO SLEEP EARLIER AND THAT JUST SPEAKS TO THE A SYMMETRY THAT'S PROBABLY ADAPTIVE IN SURVIVAL BASE THAT WE CAN RAMP OURSELVES UP FAR MORE EASILY THAN WE CONTEND TO CALLIN OURSELVES DI AND ACTUALLY IN O TO APPEAL TO OTHER CHRISTIANS LIKE ME PRAYER CAN BE A WONDERFUL WAY TO CALM YOURSELF DOWN BECAUSE THROUGH PRAYER YOUR GIVING YOUR CARIES TO GIDE AND SAYING YOU KNOW AND THEN YOU ARE RELAXED MORE RELAXED AND I JUST WHANE TO SAY THAT BECAUSE THE SAME REASON THAT YOGA MIGHT PUT SOME PEOPLE LIFE IT MIGHT PUT SOME PEOPLE LIF M TO TO TALK ABOUT PRAYER THAT IT'S THE SAME PROCESS OF BEING ABLE TO RELAX EM YET AND GET OUTSIDE OUR OWN EXPEN ANSID TAT I T I YA TO BACK OUT YET A WORLD VIEW THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY ALSO HELP US TO RELAX UM WILL YOU YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED A HOW MANY AMCLENITIONS SINCE SCIENTIST WHO COME ON THIS PODCAST U HAVE MENTION THINGS LIKE PRAYER FROM VARIOUS PERSPECTIVE ATRYANYGEISM YASLEM TRADITIONS AND OTHERS THAT UM AS IT AS A PARALLEL TO ALL OF THESE THINGS AND I THINK WHAT ITS SPEK TU IS THE FACTS THAT ULTIMATELY THE BIOLOGICAL ARCHITECTURES THAT WERE ALL CONTENDING WITH AR GOING TO BE IDENTIYE AT RIGHT AND SO DIFFERENT WAYS TO TAP INTO THEM AND N ONE'S THAT ARE UM CONGRUENT WITH PEOPLE'S BELIEFS I THINK IS ARE GREAT YET UM AT BECAUSE ANYTHING AND NONE CON GTIT YOUR RELEAS ALSO STRESS AND FEELS FORCE AND THAT WHY YOU KNOW THIS IDEA OF CALLING IT NON SLEEPDY BREAST IN ADDITION TO YOGANEDRA WAS NOT TO DETRA CT FROM THE NAMING OR THE HISTORY ROUND YOGANETRA BUT I WAS FINDING THAT IT WAS A BARRIER YOU KNOW LIKEWISE A YOGANEAD YOUR TENS TO INCLUDE THINGS LIKE INTENTIONS WHERE AS ANESTY AR SCRIPTS AND BY THE WAY WE WILL PROVIDE LINGS TO SOME ANESYAR NYOGANEDROSCRIPTS SBUT ANESTY AR HAS NO INTENTIONS ITS SIMPLY BODY SCANDY RELAXATION MAS SO AT SORT OF THE SCIENTIFIC VERSION OF ALL F THE SAT OF NACTUALL WE STUDY IT IN THE LABORATORY AND AND SOME OF THE BRAIN STATES THAT PEOPLE GO INTO BUT THAT'S A  DISCUSSION FANOTHER NOTHING IS E HARDNET MY MOTHER IS TO TELL ME HEN I LE WE COULD PLAIN I CAN'T GO TO SLEEP IF SHE'D SAY WELL YOU KNOW START WITH YOUR TOES AND RELAX SO YOU WOULD CLENCH YOUR MUSCLES ROUND YOUR TOES AND RELAX THEM AND DO THAT ALL THE WAY FROM YOUR TOES A WAE YOUR HEAD AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE GOT THIS AT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HER OWN COMMON SENSE SO AS SHE MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN IT FROM THIS A AN BE ANPIAR SHOWS CALLED THE MIND CAN KEEP YOU WELL SHES STO LISTEN TO BUT THAT'S ANOTHER INTENTIONAL RELAXATION THAT FOCUS IS ON THE BODY A RATHER THAN ON YOUR OWN MIND MENTAL PROCESSES BTTHE I DO A LO BIT OF WORK WITH THE MILITARY AND A THERS A METHOD WITHIN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS IN THE WEST MILITARY WHERE IF THEY CAN'T SLEEP WERE THER HAVING CHALLENGE OF SLEEPING YTHEY WILL DELIBERATELY TRYING RELAX THEIR FATIAL MUSCLINGS TICULAR LIKE SOR DRAPE THE FATIAL MUSCLS AND A USE LONG OR EXELL EMPHASIZE AND BREATHING O DOES SEEM TO INCREASE THE PROBABILITY OF TRANSITIONING BACK INTO SLEEE AND THOSE ARE HOLEMARKS OF YOGANEDRA NOT SLEEP DY BREAST BODY SKIN YEAND SO I THINK ALL OF THESE THINGS CONVERGE ON YE ON A COMMON THEME NOAS NEARBYOLJUST WE CAN SAY ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE DESCRIBING CERTAINLY MOVE THE NEEDLE AWAY FROM LOCUST REALLIOUS ACTOFATION AND WE HAVEN'T DONE THE EXPERIMENT TO REALLY LOOK AT THAT BUT SEEMS ALL THESE THINGS AR COUNTER TO NORDRENNL AND RELIAS AY ANOTHER WENE IS YAWNING YAWNING IN ITSELF IS IT THAT CAN OF I SORT OF TEN SING OF ALL THE B BUMUSCLES IN YOUR FACE AND THEN RELAXING THEM SO I MIGHT BE WHY WE YAWN WE DON'T KNOW WHYE YAWN YET THAT A IT MIGHT ALSO HAVE WOULD BE REALLY GREAT ACTUALLE ANIMALS YAN TO O  MY HOBLE DOG WAS IT WAS A PERPETUAL IF HE WASN'T SLEEPING HO WIS YAWNIN AND IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT YAWNING DOES TO THE LOCUSSIRUST OES THAT ALSO CALM YOUAND SWITCH LOCUS R IS ACTIVITY BECAUSE IT'S AN INTERESTING THAT FACIAL NERVE LIKE TRI DAMINAL NERVE U KNOW THET THROUGH THE VAGUUS CONNECTS A INDIRECTLY TO THE LOCUSRIIS AND HAS A POWERFUL EFFECT ON THAT INTERESTING A COMMON I THINK FRIEND OF OURS AND DIRECT COLLY OF YOURS A JACK FELDMAN WAS A GUEST ON US PODCASTS TELLING US ABOUT ALL THE AMAZING STRUCTURES HE ANOTHERS HAVE DISCOVERED IN THE IN RESPIRATION AND BREATHING YESOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE A COLLABORATION BREWING YETHREE OF U SHOULD SHOULD DEAFLY CARRY OUT I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO SHARE WITH US A LIBIT MORE ABOUT A THE SPINDLES THAT HAVE COME UP A FEW TIMES AND I DON'T KNOWIF IT'S RELEVANT TO THIS O IT'S NOT LET'S SUPARATED OUT A LOVE FOR YOU TO TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE RULE OF SLEEP IMPROBLEM SOLVING IN CREUTIVITY THER SPINDLES ARE INVOLVED AND I'LL CONSIDER MYSELF LUCKY FOR BATCHING THEM IN THE SAME QUESTION TIN I THEY'RE NOT INVOLVES TAFEEL FREE TO SUVER I THINK THEY COULD BE INVOLVED AND THE REASON WHY THINK THERE COULD BE INVALCAS WE NOW KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT SPINDLES FIRST WELL THE FIRST THING THAT WE KNEW FIRST WHILE WE IGNORED THEM THEN WE THOUGHT THEY HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH KEEPING US OT SLEEP AND THAT WAS THEIR FUNCTION IS WHEN THE NEXTERNAL STIMULUS CAME THEY WOULD KEEP US ASLEEP BECAUSE THEY WOULD ARISE BUT NOW WE KNOW THAT THE DENSITY OF OUR SLEEP SPINDLES THEN NUMBER THAT WE PRODUCE PER MINUTE IS WELL CORRELATED WITH OUR INTELLIGENCE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT NO MATTER WHAT YOUR INTELLIGENCE IS AND NO MATTER WHAT YOUR SLEEP SPINDLE DENSITY IS IF YOU LEARN SOMETHING DURING THE DAY AND INCREASE YOUR SLEEP SPINDLE DENSITY IT'S REALLY WALMOST PERFECTLY CORRELATED WITH OUR ABILITY TO CONSOLIDATE THAT INFORMATION IN AN INCORPORATED INTO THE SCHEMER THAT WE ALREADY HAVE NIN OUR BRAINS SO IF YOU TRY AND LEARN SOMETHING NEW EVEN IF YOUR SLEEP SPINDLE DENSITY AT BASE LIHT IS GREAT IF YOU DON'T INCREASE YOUR SLEEP SPINDLES THAT NIGHT YOU'RE NOT IN A YOU KNOW OU SLEEP TO REALLY INCORPORATED INTERESTINGLY SLEEP SPINDLES ORE POOR IN THOSES WITH SKITS OF FRENIA IT'S ONE OF THEM CHARACTERISTIC SIGNATURES OF SLEEP A  THAT SLEEPSPINDLES ARE VERY FEW AND FAR BETWEEN WHICH MIGHT MEAN THAT UM THAT PEOPLE WITH SKIPTS OF FRENIA MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE NEW INFORMATION INTO ALREADY EXISTING SCHEME AND INSTEAD IT SORT OF FLAPS IN THE BREEZE OUT THERE AND CAN BE ACCESS TO EM ERRONEOUSLY AT TIMES WHEN YOU YOU KOW YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE  INVOLVED SO UM I DIGRESS SO SLEEP SPINDLES AND CREATIVITYS SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE NOW KNOW THROUGH SOME GREAT STUDIES BY JULY SEEP AND A NEEDA LUTY IS THAT SLEEP SPINDLES ARE ACCOMPANIED BY AN INCREDIBLE PLASTICITY OUT IN THE DISTILL DENDRIT PHE LISTENING BRANCHES OF OUR NURONS THAT LISTEN TO OTHER CORTICAL AREAS SO THEREARE PROXMAL DENDRITES AND OUR NURANS THAT LISTEN TO THE EXTERNAL WORLD AND ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH THE PHALAMUS AND THEN THEREARE DISTILL DUNDRITES WHICH LISTEN TO IN INTERNAL CAN OF YOU KNOW CONVERSATION THAT'S HAPVING HAPPENING IN OUR BRAINS IT'S KIND OF YOU KNOWOUR INTERNAL STATE REALLY AND DURING SLEEP SPINDLES THAT'S WHEN THOSE DISTAL DUNDRITES ARE ABLE TO BEST LEARN FROM OTHER CORTICAL AREAS AN FROM THE HYPPOCAMPUS AM IT IS DURING SLEEP SPINDLES UP THE HIPPOCAPS IN THE CORTECS ARE BEST ACONNECTED AND WHEN THAT PLAS INCREDIBLE PLASTICITY CAN HAPPEN WHEN I TALK ABOUT SCHEMA THAT'S A CORTICAL CORTICAL THING THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW THE IMAGE OF SANTA CLAUS IN PRESENTS IN KNO COMES TOGETHER IT'S NOT THROUGH SOME EXTERNAL THING ONCE WE LEARN THOSE THINGS TOGETHER IT'S OUR CORTECS THAT THAT INCODES THAT AN BRINGS THOSE IMAGES BACK UP TOGETHER AND THATS DURING SLEEPSPINDLES WHEN THAT'S HAPPENING WHEN THAT A THERE'S BIG SURGES OF CALCIUM INTO THOSE AM DISTIL DENDRITES AND WHERE PLASTICITY HAPPENS IN IN JUST HUGE AMOUNCE O DURING THAT SLEEPS PENDLE STAGE OF SLEEP WHICH IS END TO STAGE THERE'S ALSO  ANOTHER EXCITATORY A EVENT THAT COMES ALL THE WAY FROM THE BRAINSTEM AND PROJECTS EVERYWHERE IN OUR QUARTEX WHICH IS CALLED P GO WAVES FODES P FOR PONDS G FRON GENICULAT NEWCLASES OF THE PHALYMUS WHICH IS WHERE THEYRE FIRST DISCOVERED AND O FROCCIPITAL AREA WHICHIS OR VISUAL AREA WHICH IS AGAIN WHERE THEYRE FIRST DISCOVERED BUT IN FACT IT'S NOW BEEN SHOWN THAT P GO WAVES WHICH WE SHOULD GENERALIZED TO P WAVES CAUSE THEY COME FROM THE PONDS AND GO TO THE PHALYMIS AND THEN DIQUARTEX HAPPENS ALL OVER THE BRAINS AND THAT IS WHERE A GLUDOMATE WHICH IS A MAJOR EXCITE TO RING NOR TRANSMITTER INVOLVED IN LEARNING AND PLASTICITY IS BEING RELEASED IN BIG AMOUNTS ALSO IN THOSE DISTILL DOWNDRIGHTS SO P WAVES AND SPINDLES WORK TOGETHER TO COSPLASTICITY AND SO AURE SCHEMA TOGETHER WHICH COULD BE THE ORIGINS FOR AM INSIHT IND CREATIVITY NOW WHEN P GO WAVES OR P WAVES AR FIRST DISCOVERED IT WAS THOUGHT TO BE RANDOM BECAUSE THIS SMALL AREA THAT GENERATES P WAVES ALL OVER THE BRAIN IN O GENT O PROJECTS ALL THE ALL OVER THE THALYMUS AND CAUSES PWAVES ALL OVER AND YOU DON'T MEASURE P WAVES ALL OVER THE BRAIN AT THE SAME TIME IN FACT IT'S JUST SEEMS SPARATIC AND RANDOM SO THAT'S PROBABLY IN P WAVES ALSO HAPPENING EVEN MORE DURING RAMSLEEP RAP AND I MOVEMENT SLEEP SO THAT'S PROBABLY THAT'S WHY PEOPLE THINK THAT REM DREAMS ARE SO RANDOM IS BECAUSE THESE P WAVES A RANDOM AND THEY COULD GENERATE DREAMS BECAUSE THEY'RE AN INTERNAL SOURCE OF EXCITATION THAT KIND OF REPLACES THE OUTSIDE WORLD DURING OUR DREAM STATE AND SO THESE P WAVES IF THEY ARE RANDOM COULD COULD FUNCTIONCOULD BE THE UNDERLYING REASON WHY REM SLEEP DREAMS AR RANDOM AND IT MIGHT ALSO BE WHY CREATIVE IT CAN HAPPEN THERE WAS BECAUSE WERE RANDOMLY ACTIVATING COACTIVATING DIFFERENT THINGS IN OUR BRAIN THAT WE CAN THEN SO TOGETHER BUT IT MIGHT NOT BE AS RANDOM AS WE THINK SO THAT'S THE CABY OT THERE I JUST LEARNED A LOT FROM ME BECAUSE I I PCH BRAINSTEM TO MEDICAL STUDENTS AND UM  TALK ABOUT THE PONDS THE PONDS LIKE THIS DENSE COLLECTION OF ALL THESE DIFFERE NEWCLLY I INVOLVE IN A BUNCH O DIFFERENT THINGS AND ITS CLOSE BY A BUNCH OF INTERESTING THINGS AND A IT STILL KUN OF A MYSTERIOUS BRAIN AREA BUT WHEN I LEARNED ABOUT P GO WAVES I THOUGHT PONDS GERNICULAT OCCIPITONLY CASOCIPITALS MOST COMMONLY ASSOCIAT WITH VISUAL QUARTEX I THOUGHT IT WAS THE ORIGIN OF THE VISUAL COMPON INT OF DREAM STAHAFLYIS A VERY HAPPY TO LEARN THAT THEY SHOULD BE CALLED P WAVES BECAUSE THEY INCLUDE LOTS OF DIFFERENT ARIES THE BRAIN IN IT MAKES REALLY GOOD SENSE TO ME WHY THE O SUDO RANDOMNESS A DREAMS ESPECIALLY THESE LATE NIGHT AN EARLY MORNING A A LATER IN SLEEP I SHANT SI AND EARLY MORNING DREAMS SEEM TO BE COBBLED TOGETHER FROM DISPERATE EXPERIENCES OW YOU YOU WALK THROUGH DOOR AND SUDDENLY IT'S A COMPLETE IFFERENT CONTACTS IN LANDSCAPE YES AM BEAUTIFUL I I LIKE THIS IDEAL ITIT MAKES INTUITIVE SENSE TO MAKESBIOLOGICAL SENSE IT ALSO GIVES ME SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT AT TO THE MEDICAL STUDENTS NEXT QUARTER WHEN I TUNG ABOUT PONDS SOR A YOU AN NOT TALK ABOUT WHERE IND THE PONDS IT'S RIGHT BELOW THE LOCUS SERILISTS IT'S CALLED THE SUBSERALIST THEIR PLUTIMATERGIC S ALSO CALLED A AS ELDE SUB LATERAL DORISL NEWCLIUS SO WEL UT AN SO AM NOTE TO ANY ASPIRING NOUR BIOLOGIST THERE'S A A VAST LANDSCAPE OF YET TO BE UNDISCOVERED STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS IN THE PONDS YOU WANT TO WORK ON SOMETHING THAT IS SURE TO REVEAL SOMETHING NOVEL WORK ON THE PON RAS IT IS IN EVERY TEXT BOOK IT'S A A CLINICALLY VERY IMPORTANT STRUCTURE AM SADLY AGLIOMA'S AN AND ANOTHER A CANSWERS O THE BRAIN CAN SOMETIMES A CAN OFTEN SURFACE IN IN THE PONDS BUT BUT WE STILL KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT AM I READ A PAPER THIS LAST YEAR OR AND I THINK IT WAS COVERED IN A BIT OF POPULAR PRESS THAT DRING RAPIDIE MOVEMENTS SLEEP PEOPLE CAN SOLVE PROBLEMS OR RESPOND TO EXTERNAL STIMUALLY LIKE FOR INSTANCE THEY WOULD GIVE THEM MATH PROBLEMS THEY'D WHISPER IN THEIR EAR WHILE THEY WERE IN RESLEEP YET YOU KNOW WHAT'S TOO PLUSTO AND PEOPLE WOULD SAY EVEN THOUG THEY WERE PARALYZ ARENTLY THEY COULD STILL MOVE THEIR MOUTH ANS THEY'D SAY FR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHER THEY'D SAY YOU KNOW WHAT'S YOUR NAME AND PEOPLE COULD RESPONDINCE SO THAT IN REMSLEEP PERHAPS PEOPLE AM SOME ELEMENTS OF COGNITION OR STILL AM ACTIVE I GLAD YOU ROUT THAT  THAT WHAT DYOUTHNG YOU AND I DO'T KNOW THE AUTHORS OF THAT STUDY AND TEM AND A LISTEN IF EVER I SAY SOMETHING WRONG IT'S GREAT ON THIS SPOT GUST BECAUSE SOME ONE WILL TELL US IN THE AMAS IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT AUSES OF YOU TWO COMENTS BUT I LOVE TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT STUDY AN IS THAT JUST KIND OF A A A AN ODD FEATURE TWHAT DOES THIS HAVE MEANING SHOALD WE CARE ABOUT THIS RESULT YES NO JUST ABOUT IT IT'S REALLY ACTUALLY INTRIGUING AND INTERESTING AND MIGHT RELATE TO THIS PAPER I TALKED ABOUT WHERE WES VERY SAID DIFFERENT AIREAS OF TE BRAIN CAN BE IN DIFFERENT STATES OF THE SLANE THE SAME TIME SO LUCID DREAMING IS' ANOTHER THING WE CAN'T ASK ANIMALS TO DO OR CAN'T ASK THEM IF THEY'VE DONE IT BUT AM WE CAN CERTAINLY ASK HUMANS TO DO IT AND SOME PEOPLE CAN DO IT REALLY WELL AND IT WOULD BE REALLY INTERESTING TO SEE IN THOSE PEOPLE WHO COULD LUSE A DREAM REALLY WELL WHETHER THEY SPEND MORE OR LESS TIME IN THIS A A SYMMETRICAL STATE WHERE ONE AIRE THE BRAIN IS IN ONE STATE ANDN ANOTHER THE BRAIN IS IN ANOTHER AND IT MIGHT BE THAT THOSE PEOPLE CAN RESPOND TO QUESTIONS DURING REMSLEEP BEST ARE THOSE THAT HAVE THE MOST STATE SYMMETERY OR OR DISSIMILARITY OR DISSOCIATION BETWEEN SUB CARTICAL AND CARTICAL STRUCTURES OR IT MIGHT BE THAT THER'RE THE ONES WITH THE MOST SYMMETRY WE DON'T KNOW AM I DO WORRY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LUCY DREAMG BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE IT'S A FAD PEOPLE ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT AND TO BE ABLE TO REMEMBER WHEN'S DREAMS IS FUN OFTEN UNLESS THEIRE NIGHTMARES AND THAT IT'S REALLY INTERESTING OR TO BE ABLE TO DIRECT ONE'S REAMS IF THEY ARE A NIGHTMARE IS IS REALLY WONDERFUL POWER TO HAVE EM TO BEALE TO REDIRECT A NIGHTMARE THAT THAS BEEN REPEATED TO SOMETHING ELSE AND THEN KICKED YOURSELF OUT OF THAT A REPETITIVE NIGHTMARY'S REALLY NICE BUT IM I WORRY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BECAUSE WE KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON IN THE BRAIN AND IF THIS LUCID DREAMING STATE IS PREVENTING US FROM FOR EXAMPLE FROM THE LOCUSTRILLIS FROM CALMING DOWN OR THE SERETENERGIC SYSTEM FROM SILENCING LIKE IT SHOULD AND MAYBE WHAT WE'RE DOING DURING THIS STATE IS YET WE'RE ACTIVATING THE LEARNING AND MEMORY STRUCTURES BUT IN A WAY THAT'S A MALADAPTIVE IN TERMS OF THE EURATIOR THAT WE NEEDS TO DO SO MAYBE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY MOST PEOPLE DON'T REMEMBER MOST OF THEIR DREAMS IS FOR GOOD REASON YOU'R HIPPOCAMPHIS ISN'T A STATE WORE IT'S NOT WRITING NEW MEMORIES IN FACTIT'S WRITING OUT IT'S THE MEMORIES IT LEARNED DURING THE DAY TO THE QUARTEX AND IT'S A IMMUNE FROM IN COMING NEW INFORMATION SO I SO MAYBE LUCID DREAMING IS BAD BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE ACTIVATING HIPPHECAMPUS IN AWAY THIS WRITING KNEW MEMORIES AND IT MIGHT BE REALLY MALADAPTIVE FOR THINGS LIKE OU KNO PITIUSTY ON THE OTHER HAND ET ME JUST ARGUE MYSELF RIGHT OUT OF THIS I WHEN I USED TO HAVE A REPEATED NIGHTMARE WHEN I WAS A KID MY MOTHER WHOAS SO WISE WOULD TELL ME WELL LISTEN JUST NEXT TIME YOU'RE IN THAT DREAM YOU DON'T SAY HEY I'M IN A DREAM AND THEN CHANGE SOMETHING ABOUT IT SO SHE AND I REHERSE TO WHAT THE HORRIBLE DREAM THAT WAS  WAS BIG MONSTER IN A RUNNING AFTER ME AND MY LEGS WERE LIKE MUD AND I COULDN'T RUN AWAY AND IT WAS JUST TERRIFYING AND THAT WAS A DREAM I WOULD HAVE IN O TIME AND TIME AGAIN SAID OKE NEXT TIME WHAT REYOU GEN A DO IN THAT MONSTER COMES AFTER YOU I WHEN A RUN AWAY NO YOU THAT'S WHAT YOU DO EVERY TIME AND IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME OUT COME YOU CAN'T RUN SO LET'S DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT LIKE WHAT WHAT COULD YOU DO THAT'S DIFFERENCE AL I GAME UP WITH ALL I COULD TURN AROUND AND PUNCH IT AN THE NOSE YA THAT'S GREAT AND SO THE NEXT TIME MY HAD THAT DREAM I DID RECCOGNIZE THIS IS THAT SAME OLD DREAM WHICH MEANS THAT THERE'S PART OF MY BRAIN THAT'S CONSCIOUS ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THIS THAT I'M IN A DREAMING STATE AND THEN I DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE IN MY DREAM CAUSE I WAS STILL TERRIFIED TO PUNCH THERE WER TOUCH THE MONSTER IN ANYWAY BUT I DID HAVE THE COURAGE TO TURN AROUND AND LOOK AT IN THE EYE AND SAID NO THAT WAS ENOUGH I SAID NO AND THAT WAS ENOUGH TO NOCK ME OUT OF THAT WRET OF THAT DREAM SO THAT I NEVER HAD IT AGAIN I NEVER HAD THAT SAME DREAM AGAIN AND IN FACT IT GAVE ME PECE ABOUT DREAMING BECAUSE I KNEW THAT IF EVER THERE WAS A NIGHTMARE THAT WAS JUST TOO SCARY I COULD PROBABLY DO SOMETHING TO CHANGE IT AND KNOCK MYSELF OUT OF IT SO EVEN THOUGH I DON'T RECOMMEND LUCID DREAMING ON A NORMAL DATODAY BASIS IF IT'S ENOUGH THAT CAN KNOCK YOU OUT OF A WRET A ONE THING THAT HAPPENS WITH PEOPLE WITH PETIASTY IS THEY HAVE THE SAME REPEATED HORRIBLE NIGHTMARE WHICH IS OFTEN A RELIVING OF THE DAY'S TRAMAN THAT THAT THEY THEY HAD SO MAYBE LUCEA DREAMING CAN BE USED ON OCCASION TO BE A POWERFUL TOOL BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH PLASTICITY THAT HAPPEN HI DRING RM SLEEP TO KNOCK YOU OUT OF THAT RET OF ARELIVING THAT EVENT AND AND JUST CHANGE IT YOU KNOW AND YOU COULD PROBABLY PRACTISE THAT DURING WAKEFULNESS NA REHEARSE THE E TNT THAT HAPPENED THAT WAS SO TRAMATIC AND THEN JUST INTRODUCE A NEW ELEMENT LIKE YOU KNOW NOW I'M SAFE NOW WE KNOW THE SOUND THAT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT REALLY TRAMATIC THING I SHOULD NOW ASSOCIATE WITH SOMETHING NELSE AN NEXT TIME I HAVE THAT DREAM I'M GOING TO CHANGE IT SO THAT SOUND IS NOW THIS NEW THING THAT IS SHOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH SAFETY D THAT MIGHT BE ENOUGH MAYBE I HOPE A TO KNOCK YOU OUT OF THAT REPEATED NIGHTMARE AND MAYBE EVEN STRICE OU ON THE PATH TO RECOVERY BECAUSE IF YOU CAN COME DOWN ABOUT THOSE NIGHTMARE STATES OF SLEEP THEN MAYBE YOUR LOCA SIRILLIS WHICH IS INVOLVED IN STRESS CAN ALSO RELAX AND YOU CAN DO THE ERACE YOUR PARTS THAT NEED TO BE DONE I LOVE IT I SEEM TO RECALL A PAPER AND I'LL HAVE TO FIND THE REFERENCE IN AND AM SEND IT YOU WE WILL ALSO PUT IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS THAT DESCRIBED A PRO TO CALL SENTIRY MATCHES THIS UM  IDEA AND I THINK WHAT THEY HAD PEOPLE DO AS EITHER CUE THEMSELVES TO A PARTICULAR SMELL OR TONE IN WAKEFULNESS THEN TO TRYING RECALL A RECURRING NIGHTMARE YET THEN DURING THE NIGHT SLEEP THEY HAVE THE TONE PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND WHICH WOULD THEN CU THEM TO THE WAKEFUL STATE THERE STILL ASLEEP MIND YOU BUT IN THE SUDO LUCID OR SINSDATE AND THEN TRYING CHANGE SOME VARIABLE  AS YOURE DESCRIBING I SHOE EITHER LOOK THAT THE AM PREDITOR IN THE EYES AR IDO SOMETHING DIFFERENT YET AND THEN IN THE WAKING STATE TAKE A LOBA OF TIME TO TRY AND SCRIPT OUT A DIFFERENT AM NARRATIVE ALTOGETHERAND IT TOOK SEVERAL NIGHTS AS I RECALL OR MORE BUT THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO ESCAPE THIS RECURRING I ARS LIKE A WEAK OR SOMETHING NOW TO YOUR FAMILIAR YET A VIEWD OF HEL STUDY I LOVED IT YE WE WILL  PUT A REFERENCE TO THAT I AND I NEED TO REVISIT THAT SAY WHICH PRETTY RECENT BUT I I NEEN TO DIVE INTO IT AGAIN AS I THINK I I DIDN'T GO AS DEEP INTO IT AS I I SHOULD A NO NO THAT ITTHE ONE THING THAT YOU THAT YOU  YOU SAID MANY RIGHT THINGS BAT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU SAID IS THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO CUE THE DREAMER AM WHEN THEY THEY KNEW AN AND THEY WERE GOING TO REM SLEEP AND THEN THEY PLAYED THE SOUND OR HAD THE ODOUR NOW WHEN YOUARE NORMALLY ASLEEP ALONE IN YOUR BED YOURE NOT EN TO BE ABLE TO CUE YOURSELF BUT IT MIGHT BE THAT REHEARSAL ENOUGH BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP IS ENOUGH TO YOU KNO HELP CO YOU  TO THAT REPEATED NIGHTMARE REMEMBERING WHAT THE NIGHTMARE IS AND THEN FIGURING OU HAD A CU YOURSELF TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN YEARS I HAD THE SAME RECURRING NIGHTMARE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND IT WAS SO SALIENT AND SO CLEAR AND I'M NOT CON SHURE WHAT IT IS CAUSE IT'S AM SOMETHING TS THAT TOSTURBING AS IS ITI THINK IT WAS SLEEP EMOTIONAL LOAD OF IT  JUST HOW SALI AT CERTAIN FEATURES R LIKE ONE PERSON IN AM WHO'S A REAL LIFED PERSON HAD A PARTICULAR U CLOTHING TON IT'S LIKE IN THAT JUST SERVED AS HIS CUAND YEI DON'T KNO IF I EVER DID ANY DIRECT WORK TO TRY AND DEAL WITH IT BUT NOW IT ALMOST SEEM SILLY TO DESCRIBE AND O YEM LONE DREAMS ARE  USUALLY SILLYTO D IRDYRY SILLI THEY ARE MOTINALLY A VIOLENT DREAMAND YOUR MOTIONAL SYSTEM IS SO CURED  DURING REM SLEEP WHICH IS ANOTHER THING WE COULD TALK ABOUT E APES UM I LOOVE YES SO LOCA SERULIA SIS IDEALLY  SUPPRESSED SO WE CAN'T RELY SNOR UP IN EFFERAND WE CAN'T ACT OUT OUR DREAMS UM THIS A DURING THESE VERY EMOTIONALLY LAID IN UM TOUGHT AND AND STORY LINES DURING SLEEP SO ALMOST LIK STARTS A SOUND LIKE A LIBIT OF A BUILTIN U WHILE SWEEPING TRAMATHERA BECAUSE MOST TRAMATHERABIES IN VALL TRYING TO GET PEOPLE INTO STATES OF UM COUNTER TO WHAT MOST PEOPLE THINK YOU AS SHOU WANT TO GET CLOSE TO THE TRAM AN TERMS OF THE NARRATIVE THAT'S A TRYING SUPPRESS THE EMOTIONAL R ACTIVITY OF IT OR I GUESS IT'S THE MOTIVATION FOR CEDAMING BASE THERMIS MATRAMA OR I'VE ALSO HEARD IN THE SYSTEM PERPLEXIIN TO ME THAT OTHER WAKING THASE TRAMATERABES INVOLVE TAKING PEOPLE THE OTHER WAY MAKE IT VERY CATHARTIC TAKE THEM TO THE PEAK OF THE EMOTION WHE RESPONSE BUT THEN ALLOW THAT TO FINALLY CYCLED DOWN INTO A MORE RELAXED RESPONSE SO PLEASE UM IF THERE'S ANYTHING ABOUT LOCUS SERULIOS AND AND DREAMS AND THAT CAN HELP PEOPLE BASICALLY EXTINGUISHED TRAMAS OR HRAMATIC FEATURES TO TO REAL LIFE EVENTS SHAREY DEFFLING ONE TO KNOW ABOUT YE YE WELL I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE TOUGHT MIGHT HELP AFTER A TRAMA LIKE A SCHOOL SHOOTING OR WHATEVER WEN A CRACSIN IT IS TO TALK ABOUT IT AND IN BED IN FACT THAT ENDED OF BEING COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS I AS CONTERPRODECTIVE IS DIDN'T TAKE IT THEM BACK DOWN UM IT BROUGHT THEM UP AND CONTINUED TO REACTIVATE THE EMOTIONS OF IT BUT THEN' DIDN  KNOW EMPHASIZE THE SAFETY O FACT THAT IT'S OVER UM OR HELP THEM WORK THROUGH HOW THEY MIGHT AVOID IT AGAIN IN THE FUTURE TO CALM THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM DOWN AGAIN BEFORE THEY WENT TO SLEEP IN A AND  ANY NONE OF THESE STUDIES HASE SLEEP EVER BEEN CONSIDERED BUT TO ME THAT'S THE KEY PART IS BRINGING DOWN YOUR SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP SO THAT YOUR SLEEP CAN BE ADAPTIVE YOUR LOCASERLESS CAN SHUT UP LIKE AN NORMALLY DOES OR SHOULD DO AND THEN ABLE TO ERACE THE NOVELTY OF IT THE OTHER THING THAT UM I JUST MENTIONED A MINUTE AGO IS THTHE EMOTIONAL SYSTEM IS HIGHLY ACTIVATED AND REM SLEEP AND THAT'S DEFINITELY TRUE AND THAT MIGHT SEEM COUNTER PRODUCTIVE IN TERMS OF IU KNOW THE NIGHTMARIS AND AND HOW TO HELP REM SLEEP BE A THERAPUTIC THING RATHER THAN A A THAN A  IN REENFORCING THE EMOTIONALITY OF THE TRAMA AND I THINK THE KEY TO THAT AGAIN IS THE ABSENCE OF ANARP AN EFFERAND SO EVEN THOUG THE EMOTIONAL SYSTEM IS IN HIGH YEAR WITHOUT NORPANEFRAND YOU CAN ACTUALLY A DIVORCE THOSE HIGHLY ACTIVATED EMOTIONS FROM THE COGNATIVE PARTS OF THE MEMORY THAT YOU HAVE JUST WRITTEN OUT IN THAT INTO STAGE OF SLEEP WHEN THE SLEEP SPINDLES ARE GOING SO A SO YOU'VE JUST NOW CONSOLITED THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'LL NEED TO SURVIVE AND TO YOU KNOW TO MAKE THAT ADAPTIVE AND NOW YOU NEED TO DIVORCE FROM THAT SCHEMA AND FROM THAT SEMANTIC PARTS OF MEMORY THE EMOTIONAL PART BECAUSE WHENEVER YOU REMEMBER SOMETHING IS FINE IF YOU REMEMBER THE BEING EMOTIONAL AT THE TIME BUT YOU DON'T WANT A BRING BACK AND SO INTO THAT MEMORY ALL OF THE SAME EMOTIONAL SYSTEMS YOU DO'T WANT TO BRING BACK YOU KNOW THE HEART RATE CHANGES IND THE SWEATING AND AND ALL OF THAT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO REMEMBER ALL THE PARTS OF IT AND EVEN REMEMBER THAT YOU WERE DROMATIZED AND THAT YOU DID CRY AND THAT YOU DID HAVE IN ALL YOUR HEART WAS RACING BUT WHEN YOURE TALKING ABOUT IT YEARS LATER YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO RELIVE ALL THAT OTHERWISE WHO WHOOULD EVER WANT TO RECALL A DRAMATIC MEMORY BECAUSE YOU'RE BASICALLY PUTTING YOURSELF THOUG THE SAME TRAMA WHICH IS WHAT PEOPLE OF PETI ASITE HAVE THEY DON'T WANT TO RECALL THIS DRAMATIC MEMORY BECAUSE OF IT'S RE LIVING I LIKE ITS JUST HAPPENING AGAIN SO THAT'S WHAT WERE THINKING IS THAT A THE EMOTIONAL PARTS ARE NOT LONGER ARE NOT ABLE TO BE DIVORCED BECAUSE THE NORTHBENEFANT SYSTEM IS NOT DOWNSCALED DURING REM SLEEP AND SO THAT REMSLEEP SERVES INSTEAD REENFORCE AND IN FACT AMPLIFY THE EMOTIONS BECAUSE YOU'RE YOUR MOTIONAL SYSTEM IS UP THE CASRILISES HIGH RE SEWING IN EVERY NIGHT THE EMOTIONALITY OF THO MEMORIES AND WITH THE MEMORY ITSELF YOU A TOLD ESWAD ABOUT LOCUS RULIS IN NORAP AN IFERAND FROM LOCUS RULI IS ER ANY ROLE FOR A NORPAN EFERAN EPAN EFFERNIN QUARTERS ALL RELEASED FROM THE DREANALS AMY NDERSTANDING IS THAT NORPAN EFFERN AN EFFERN NEFRAN WILL NOT CROSS THE BLOOD RAINBERRY WOWT JUST PROBABLY WHY WE HAVE THE BRAINBASED NATRONERGIC SYSTEM YET LOCUS RULY I AT ANOTHER ANOTHER NR ONSPRS I SHOU THAT'S A QUESTION I SHOULD ASK YOU BUT THERE OTHER SIGHTS IN THE BRAIN WHERE NORUP AN I FREN IS RLEAS ROM ORS A JUST LOCOS RULE A SO THERERE SEVEN OH CNINS OF YES A ER NERGIC YES THERE'S NINE DIFFERENT ATENERGE I SHUD ANS  O A AN AIT BUT IT JUST OCCUR TO ME THAT AM IN SOME CASES LIKE T RAFIN THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES OF A CERTAN URGIC DRIVE IN THE GRAIN BUT RAFES LIKE  ONE MEANS SAT THAT'S THE ONE THAT GOES THE QARTEX AND AND AND THE LOCUSTRALES IS ALSO THE ONE THAT GOES THE QUARTEX BUT THERE ARE OTHER ADENERGIC SOURCES SOME THAT A FROM THE BRAINSTEM THAT DESCEND AND HELP US TO IGNOR PAIN FOR EXAMPLE I'M WHEN WE'RE STREST AND MEETING TO RUN AWAY FROM THE TIGERI ON'T WANT TO BE THINKING ALL MY ANKLE HURTS HEAN AR YOU WONE IT JUST BE ABLE TO IGNORE IT AND GO DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO SO AM YES SO THERRE LOTS OF OTHER NORADENERGIC A NUCLY I BUT THE LOCUSTRILUS IS THE MAIN ONE THAT PROJECTS ALL OVER THE BRAIN THE ACTUALLY THE ONLY PLACE A DOESN'T PROJECT IS THE DORSAL STRATUM YOU TALKED ABOUT VENTUAL STRATUM AND ADDICTION THE DORSALSTRADOM IS THE ONLY PLACE THE LOCUS R US DOESN'T PROJECT TO AND THAT'S INVOLVED IN PRECEDURA LEARNING MOTOR LEARNING A  KINDS OF LEARNING THAT TAKE OVER WHEN YOU HYPPICAMPUS FOR EXAMPLE IS COMPROMISED VY LATTER IF YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD HYPPTICAMUS YOU CAN STILL DO PROCEDURE LEARNING AND O AND IT'S GREAT IT'S A REDUNDANT SYSTEM AND SO AM IF YOURE LOCUSTRILIS IS NOT WORKING  YOU DON'T HAVE IT ANY MORE YOU CAN STILL DO IF YOU IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GOOD HEPO CAMPAS YOU CAN STILL DO LEARNING THROUGH THIS DORSAL STRAIT ON THE STRUCTURE SO IT MIGHT BE FOR THOSE KINDS OF LEARNING A FUNCTIONS A SLEEP DEPROVATION WHERE YOU NEVER LET THE LOCUSTRIA STOP FIRING IS OKE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY HE RECEPTORS FOR ANORPAN EFFRENT ANYWAY SO A YA IN ONE ABOUT BODILY A BELAS E DRNALS YET M YOU KNOW I I OFFER MY PEOPLE O KNOW SUCH THING AS A DREAN'L BURN OUT RUSAY THAN A DREANALS DON'T ACTUALLY A BURN OUT A BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE A MA DEANAL IN SUFFICIENCY SOONDRUM OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BUT DRENALS AT AR JUSTCHRONICALLY RANKYIU OW  A UP ENOUGH FOR IN NORP ANEFFERN IN YET WHART IS ALL YEAT THE WRONG TIMES EASCULAR YE YE SO THAT THERE'S AR GREAT QUESTIONS AND I THINK THE ANSWERS TO THEM HAVE YET TO BE DISCOVERED THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN OUR PERFERY AND OUR CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE BEAUTIFUL CONNECTIONS AND IT'S UNTAPET SOURCE OF BEING ABLE TO MANIPULATE OUR BRAINS IS TO WORK THROUGH OUR BODIES AND SO A OUR DREANALS DO GREAT THINGS THEY CONSTRICT OUR BLOOD VESSELS CAUSING HIGHER BLOOD PRESSURE WHICH HELP BLOOD RUSH OUT TELL THE EXTREMITIES THAT NEED BLOOD A WENOUR MUSCLES FOR EXAMPLE FOR RUNNING AWAY FROM THE LION A OR THE TIGER OR WHEN A RING A GRAN THATLINEARE WORKING A YET I RE CATCHING A TRAN AN ATCHING A TRA YET A THE DREANALS HELP OUR HEARTS BUMP FASTER RMUSCLES GET PROFUSED WITH TEM A BLOOD IT NEEDS A IT DIVERTS BLOOD AND EVERYTHING AWAY FROM OUR A PARI SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM WHICH IS REST AN DIGEST AM WE DON'T REALLY NEED TO DIGEST THAT CRUSSANT WHEN A RUNNING FOR A TRAIN WE CAN DO THAT LATER AM SO IT'S DOING REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS WHAT WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT DOESN'T CROSS THE BOOD BRAIN BERRIER IS HOW THAT AFFECTS THE BRAIN AND WHETHER OR IF WE CAN INDEPENDENTLY ACTIVATE OURDIC I A DRENALS A WHEN AR TIME IN OUR BRAIN THINKS THAT WE SHOULD BE FINE AND CALM AND ASLEEP A HOW OUR BRAIN DETECTS THAT AN IS IT A FEED BACK THROUGH OUR HEART IS RACING AND AN OUR BRAINSTENDS AYS WHAT'S POING ON MY HEART IS RA ACING AND THEN WAKES US UP AND THEN OUR HEARTS WERE RACING TOGETHER WITH OUR RAIN RACING WE WE JUST DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS YET N THERE ARE SOME GGOOD STUDIES OLD STUDIES AM BUT  WE NEED A LOT MORE THERE'LL ANOTHER ANOTHER NOD TO THE FACT THAT THIS LOTS OF GREAT WORK ON GOING YE AND STILL TO DO LOF YOU TO TELL US ABOUT SOME OF THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING MORE RECENTLY ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SLEEP AND OPIAT USE WITHDRAWL RELAPSE  AND UN AN CRAVING JUST ADDICTION GENERALLY I GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT PEOPLE TRYING TO COME OFF PENCIDAY AS O PENS  OR ON PEOPLE'S CHALLENGES WITH PENCIDAY ASIPIN AND OTHER TYPES OF EDICTION A YE WHAT WHAT IS THE ROLE OF SLEEP IN A DICTION AND RECOVERY FROM A DICTION AND OPIATS IN PARTICULAR MA O THIS IS A VERY YOUNG ARIA AND IN FACT MY LABORATORY IS JUST STARTED I HAVE A GRADUATE STUDENT WHO'S BEEN IN MY LAVFOR JUST ONE YEAR SHE'S DONE AMAZING WORK ALREADY BUT COMPLETELY GROUND BREAKING WORK AND WHAT SHE HAS DISCOVERED ALREADY WE DON'T HAVE THE PAPER OUT YET THAT A WERE WORKING ON IT IS THAT A WHEN ANIMALS WITH DRAW FROM OPIATS AND THIS HAS BEEN SORT OF REFLICATED IN OTHER WAYS WITH OTHER TITES OF THINGS A OUR SLEEP IS DISTURBED OUR SLEEP IS TERRIBLY DISTURBIND THE AMOUNT OF SLEEP DISTURBANCE PREDICTS RELAPSE BEHAVIORS  THAND YOU MIGHT THINK WELL COURSE YOU'RE GOING TO RELAPSE IF YOU CAN'T SLEEP BECAUSE OPIATS CALM YOU DOWN WILL LEARNTS REASONS WHY OPIATS CALM YOU DOWN IS BECAUSE THE LOCUS ARILUS AGAIN WE SPOT IS COVERED WITH OPIAT RECEPTORS AND THAT ORE NORMALLY REALLY RESPONSIVE TO OUR INDOGENOUS OPIATS AM AND SO WHAT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WEARE PLEASED FOR EXAMPLE OR LAUGHING OR WHATEVER  AND DOGOUS OPIATS A HAPTIVATE THOSE RECEPTORS IN LOCUSTRILIS AND CALM IT DOWN AND IT ACTUALLY A SUPPRESSES LOCUSTRILIS ACTIVITY MAKES US HAPPY AND RELAXED ONE OF THE THINGS REASONS WHY OPIATS ARE SO ADDICTIVE IS BECAUSE IT ALSO CALMS US DOWN AND MAKES US RELAXED ABUT THE PROBLE WITH EXOGENEOUS OPIATS IS THAT THEY REALLY BYT STRONGLY BIND THEVES RECEPTORS ON OUR LOCUSTRILIS AND IF YOU TAKE AND OT EXOGENOUS OPIATS AGAIN AND AGAIN LIKE YOURE RECOVERING FROM SURGERY FOR EXAMPLE TAKE THIS PAIN MEDICATIONS IS THAT OUR LOCUSTRILO STRUGGLES TO DO WHAT ITSPOSED TO DO WHICH HAS KEEP US AWAKE AND LEARNING AND AND CONCENTRATING ON THINGS SO IT WILL DOWN REGULATE IT WILL INTERNALIZE THESE RECEPTORS THAT OR NORMALLY ONLY OCCUPIED BY ANDOGOUS OPIATS AND ND IT WILL DO THIS IT WILL CHANGE OUR GENES THAT OURE ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCING THESE RECEPTORS SOE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE VERY MANY FEWER RECEPTORS SO THE LOCUS ROLLS AT LE STURING WAKEFULNESS CAN FIRE AND HELP US TO DO THESE THINGS LIKE LEARN ABOUT OUR ENVIRONMENT AND SO IF YOU LONG TERM REDUCE THE NUMBER OF RECEPTORS OUT THERE A THEN WHEN YOU WITH DRAW THE EXOGENOUS OPIATS ERTIS NOT ENOUGH OF YOUR INDOGENS OPIATS TO UM TO BE ABLE TO REOCCUPY THOSE FEW RECEPTORS THAT ARE THERE AND OUR LOCUSTRILIS HAS NOTHING TO CALM A DOWN ANY MORE NO PACIFIER AND IT JUST FIRES AND FIRES AND FIRES AND THAT PHASIC AND TONIC HIGH ACTIVITY STRESSES US OUT BECAUSE IT'S NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH STRESS AND SO ANY ANXOGENOUS STRESS OR THAT ADDS TO THAT AND ALSO ACTIVATES HER LOCUS RILUS THERE'S NOTHING TO CALM A DOWN AGAIN AND SO IT JUST KEEPS FIRING IT DISTURBS OUR SLEEP UM AND THAT'S WHY MAY BE SLEEP DISTURBANCE IS A AN INDICATOR OF A HYPER ACTIVE LOCUS SERILIS AND UM AND SUCH A GOOD PREDICTOR OF RELAPSE BEHAVIORS BECAUSE NOBODY LIKES TO LIVE IN THAT HIGH STRESS STATE AND THEY'LL DO ANYTHING UM TO GET BACK TO NORMAL SO THE PROB WITH WITH AM TAKING THESE DRUGS IS THAT IT IT LEAVES YOU RE EXCITED AND HOURTNESS I ECID RELAXED AND HAPPY BUT THEN WHE YOU COME OFF IT IT YOUR WORSE THAN WHEN TH WHEN YOU WERE AT BASE LINE YOU TAKE IT AGAIN M IT ONLY BRINGS YOU UP THIS FAR BECAUSE YOUR FEWR RECEPTORS WHEN YOU COME OFF IT YOUR DOWN EVEN MORE DEPRESSED AND AN ANXIOUS AND A DEPRESSED AS A WORD I USE LOOSELY AND THAT IS NOT BUT I CERTAINLY CENTRAL NERVOU SYSTEM DEPRESSION TO IN SLEEP URE LESS MODIVATED THAT LORDIUD YE I MEAN OUR LOCUS RILIS'S ACTUALLY IT'S A IT'S A THE ANXIETY KIND OF DEPRESSION ACTUALLY ANXIETY RELATED DEPRESSION SO UM YES SO WE DON'T KNOW YET WHAT AND THERE'S SOME GOOD RESEARCH GOING ON RIGHT NOW WHAT COULD RESTORE OUR OWN ANDOGENIS RECEPTORS SO THAT OUR OWN DOGENOUS OPIATS CAN PROPERLY CALM OR LOCUSERILIS UM ONCE THAT THEY'VE BEEN TAMPED DOWN BY EXOGENOUS OPIATS BUT THAT WOULD BE REALLY ONE WAY THAT YOU CAN ACCESS M THE SLEEP DISTERBANC SO WE TALKED ABOUT SLEEP AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SLEEP IN TERMS OF LEARNING AN MEMORY THE IMPORTANCE OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE NINETY MENUTES CYCLE FOR ALL OF THAT SO YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOUR SLEEP IS DISTURBED BY TOO MUCH LOCUSRIALOUS ACTIVITY THETHE THE STRUCTURE AND THE FUNCTION OF THOSE SLEEP SPINDLES AND THAT THETA DRING REMSLEEP AND THE AND THE LACK OF NORPE AN EFFRAND ALL OF THOSE STRUCTURES ALL THOSE FUNCTIONS FOR FOR LEARNING SOMETHING NEW LIKE A NEW BEHAVIOR THAT AS AS INVOLVED THE DRUGS BECOMES A COMPROMISED AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT TAN YOLUGOS IN COLLABORATION WITH PAMELA KENNETY AT YOU SEE ALA THAT WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT HOWS LEARNING AND MEMORY AFFECTED BY THE SLEEP DISTURBANCE IF THEIR WAY WE CAN UM IN ANIMALS THAT OVE COMING OFF OF OPIATS CAN WE RESTORE THEIR SLEEP TO NORMAL SO THAT THEN THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO A DULY RELAPSED KINDS OF BEHAVIORS FASCINATING IN I'M I WE'LL CERTAINLY HAVE TO HAVE YOU BACK ON TO TELL US THE RESULTS OF THOSE STUDIES MEANWHILE I THINK FOR ANY ONE WHOSE TRYING TO A COME OFF OPIATS A EXAUGIN OS SOPIATS AND RESTORE THESE SYSTEMS A WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME BUT THAT ANY AND ALL THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO TO BUFFER THERE HEALTHY NORMAL SLEEP ARCHITECTURE LIKE MORNING IND DAYTIME SUNLIGHT LIMITING BRIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE LOWERING THE TEMPERATURE AT NIGHT A NUMBER OFTHINGS AT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE  ON YOURSELF DOO AN ANYTHING I WERE ISLY TERS MEDITATION WHATEVER IT IS TE HELPS YOU CALL MESEMF FOR SLEEP YA I WOULD AS WOULD FACILITATE NOT JUST SLEEP BUT PERHAPS EVEN ACCELERATE THE THE RECOVERI AND A AND SHORTEN THIS PERIOD OF WITHDRAWL WHICH FROM THE QUESTIONS I GET HIM FROM WHAT I HEAR A CAN BE ABSOLUTELY BRUDAL  SO I CAN IMAGINE I HAD TO TAKE OPIATS FOR I ONLY TOOK IT FOR THREE DAYS AFTER GIVING BIRTH TO MY A FIRST SUNMIGTING SECOND SON ONE OF THEM AND A AND JUST I JUST SAID AFTER THREE DAYS THIS IS ENOUGH I'M JUST GOIN TO TRY TILAN ALL AND A SO ID I WEANED MYSELF NOT WEIND I JUSTDID A SUDDEN SHARP CUT OFF AND EVEN THOUGH I FELT I DIDN'T GET THE HIGH O OTHIATS WHEN I WAS TAKING THE A TILIN AL CUN COULDING A WHEN I WHEN OU THAT BOY IT WAS LIKE PMES TIMES ONE HUNDRED I WAS SO ANXIOUS AN UPSET AT LITTLE THINGS AID THANKFULLY ONLY LASTED O FEW HOURS BUT IF I HAD TAKEN IT FOR A WEEK OR TWO WEEKS WHO KNOWS IF I MY INDOGES OPIAT RECEPTORS WOULD HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY DOWN REGULATED AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ATICT YOU KNOW AN ADECT I WOULD HAVE BEEN ADDICTED I SHOUN THIN AN ADIC THERE'S NEGATIVE CONNETATIONS AS JUST A VERY PHYSIOLOGICAL STATE SO A NO JUDGMENTS AT ALL ASSOCIATED WITH IT SO A YE THER POWERFUL POWERFUL PAIN CILLERS BUT CAN ALSO ALTER YOU'RE ENTIRE BRAIN AND REQUIRE IT WELL A ALL THE MORE REASON WHY I MANY OTHERS ARE GRATEFUL THAT YOU'R DOING THIS WORK TO FIGURE OUT WAYS THAT PEOPLE CAN RECOVER A MORE QUICKLY AND MORE THOROUGHLY I MUST SAY YOU'VE TAUGHT US A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT IN A IN A RELATIVELY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME ABOUT THE ARCHITECTURE OF SLEEP THE DIFFERENT PHASES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SLEEP AND DREAMING AND THIS INCREDIBLE STRUCTURE LOCUS SRULIOS AND I'M SO HAPPY WE ALSO GOT INTO THE PONDS THAT JUST THELIGHTS ME BECAS THA WE RARELY TALK ABOUT THE PONDS ON THIS PODCAST IS SUCH AN INTERESTING STRUCTURE A SEX DIFFERENCEIS A THAT ARE IMPORTANT CRETIVITY AND PROBLEM SOLVING AND A AN TRAMA SLEEP SPINDLES JUST SUCH A WEALTH OF

E'LL SO ONE O THANK YOU FOR DOING THE WORK YOU DO EVEN THOUGH I'M A FELLOW NORRW BIOLOGIST I THINK THAT A IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT A WE TAKE A STEP BACK AND REALIZE THAT IT'S REALLY THE WORK OF A HARD THINKING HARD A STRONGLY MOTIVATED A PIES STANR PERS PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR BY THE WAY P IYES LIKE YOURSELF GRADUATE SUENTS AND POSTOCKS THAT REALLY DRIVE THE DISCOVERY FORWARD AND THAT LEAD TO THESE NEW THERAPUTICS AM PHYSICIANS ARE WONDERFUL CLINITIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL BUT CLINCIONS DON'T DEVELOP NEW TREATMENTS THEY THEY ONLY IMPLEMENT THE ONES THAT RESEARCTERS DISCOVERS AN THANK YOU FOR BEING A BRAIN EXPLORE  WITTHING AM WITH A FOCAS ON A GROWING THE GOOD IN THE WORLD  I KNOW I SPEAK FOR EVERYBODY WHEN I SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH ANDRU THINK FOR BEING AN AMAZING INTER

THE LOCKRUM AND THE COACH IS BERADING THE OTHER PLAYERS ON THE TEAM FOR FOR NOT BEING AGGRESSIVE AND HE SAYS THE ONLY PERSON OUT THERE STICKING ANYBODY WHICH I DON'T KNOW IF THEY STILL USE THAT EXPRESSION BUT I LIKE THAT EXPRESS STICKING ANYBODY IS GARRY GULMAN A KID WHO NEVER PLAY FOOTBL HOTILL THIS SUMMER AND I WUL I HAD GOOSE PUMPS AND IT WAS IT IT WAS LIKE A MOVY IT SO IT'S ALL HAPPENING

TECHNIQUE U COULD USE TILL I GET AROUND THAT I EITHER EITHER THEY THEY DIDN'T SUGGEST ONE OR I WASN'T ABLE TO EMPLOY IT UPPOSING QUARTER BACKS LEARNED TO STAY AWAY FROM THE SIDE OF THE LINE THAT GARRY WAS ON SO HE WASN'T SACKING ANY ONE ANY MORE AND AFTER THIS ONE TIME WHEN GARRY FUMBLED THE BALL ON A BIG PLAY AT THE GOAL LINE SUDDENLY HE SAYS THEY STOPPED SENDING HIM OUT FOR PASSES SO NO MORE HUROE CATCHES HE WASN'T MAKING BIG PLAYS HE WAS NOT LIVING UP TO ALL THAT BRIGHT POTENTIAL AND SOME DARK PART OF HIS PERSONALITY KICKED IN I MAYBE HE WAS A WASTE AFTER ALL THE MAN COSTUME HAD FOOLD THEM FOR A WHILE HE WAS STILL THE SAME PERSON OUAD ALWAYS BEEN HE SHUED TO DREAD PRACTICES AND GAMES I WOULD THROW UP BEFORE EVERY GAME ON THE SIDLINE I WOULD THROW UP BECAUSE I WAS OVERCOME BY

RELIEF SHE'D BEEN WORRIED THAT SHE WAS GOING TO LEARN THAT HER DAD REALLY DID COACH HER TO LIE ABOUT HER MUM NOW SHE COULD PUT THAT ASIDE SHE COULD REMEMBER HIM THE WAY SHE ALWAYS HAD AS HER BEST FRIEND AND A GOOD DAD BUT THEN CORWIN PUBLISHED A CASE STUDY ABOUT NICHOLL HE DIDN'T US HER NAME HE CALLED HER JANEDOLL BUT CORWIN'S CASE STUDY BECAME PART OF A HUGE DISPUTE THAT WAS FRACTURING PSYCHOLOGY IN THE NINETIES IT WAS CALLED THE MEMORY WAS AND THE ARGUMENT WAS ABOUT WHERE THE REPRESSED MEMORIES AT OLT SUDDENLY REMEMBERING TRO MA WERE REAL SOME SCIENTIST BELIEVE REPRESSD MEMORIES WERE POSSIBLE OTHER SAID NO WAY N COLSVIDIO TAPES AND COWYN'S ARTICLE WET COUPTED BY THE SIDE THAT THOUGHT REPRESSED MEMORIES WERE REAL THEY THOUGHT NACOL'S CASE PROVED IT COWYN HADN'T SEEN HIS COMING I'E SPOKEN TO HIM HE SAYS HE WASN'T ON EITHER SIDE DOCTOR ELIZABETH LOFTIS RED COWYN'S ODICAL WITH ONE EYEBROWT FAMILY RASE SHE WAS A PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON AND A BIG DEAL IT WAS HER EXPERIMENTS THAT PROVED MEMORIES INVALIABLE AND SHE WAS A STA WITNESS IN HYPROPHOL COUR CASES WHEC SHE OGUED THAT IYE WITNESS RECOLLECTIONS ON RELIABLE SO WHEN THE MEMORY WAS BEGAN SHE KNEW WHICH SIDE SHE WAS ON SHE THOUGHT REPRESSED MEMORIES WHAT ALMOST NEVER REAL SHE WROTE A DOORSTOP OF A BOOK CALLED THE MITH OF REPRESSED MEMORY WHEN SHE WREAD THE JANEDO CASE SHE WAS ALARMED I KNEW THAT PEOPLE WERE USING THIS CASE IS THE NEW PROOF OF REPRESSED MEMORY IT WAS BEING DISCUSSED ACADEMICALLY IT WAS BEING INTRODUCED INTO COURT CASES TO PROVE THAT REPRESSED MEMORY IS REAL AND HAS BEEN PROVEN IT BEIT WAS BEING USED AGAINST HEOPLE WHOM I THOUGHT WERE INNOCENT AH BECAUSE THEY WERE ON TRIAL IN THEIR CASES AND SO WE HAD TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT POT OF HAS SUSPICION WAS THE MESSAGE AND POT WAS THE MESSENGER SHE SEEN COLWIN TESTIFY IN COURT ON ANOTHER CASE A PATIENT ACCUSED THAT THERAPIST OF ABUSE AND SHE DIDN'T FIND HIM PERSUASIVE THERE EITHER IM ALREADY HAD A SUSPICION ABOUT COORIN AND HIS JUDGMENT HI THINK GOING INTO THIS SITUATION BECAUSE OF THE WORK I HAD SEEN HIM DO ON THIS OTHER CASE AND HOW HE HAD PRETTY MUCH YOU KNOW HELP TO RUIN THE LIFE OF THIS POOR FEMALE PSYCHIATRICE WHO WAS THE ACCUSED PERSON IN THIS OTHER CASE YOU AR SAYING THAT THE FEMALE PSYCHIATRIST WAS ACCUSED OF A BOU YES BY BY I THINK OF FORMER PATIENT AND COWYN WAS SAYING THAT THAT HAD HAPPENED IN SO MANY WORDS YES HE WAS HE WAS AN EXPERT FOR THE ACCUSER LOFTA'S DECIDED TO INVESTIGATE THE JANE DO CASE SHE WANTED TO KNOW WHETHER THE ABUSE HAD REALLY HAPPENED BUT TO DO THAT SHE NEEDED TO KNOW THE REAL NAME OF THAT LITTLE GORL RATHER THAN ASCOWYN WHICH WOULD BE NOMAL FOR E RESUCH A LOOKING INTO SOME ONE ELSE'S STUDY SHE DECIDED TO DEGROUND ON HER OWN LOFTA'S KNEW WHET TO STOT CLUSE IN THE CAPES AT SOME POINT IN THE TAPE HE CALLED HER NA COL ANDI JUST MADE A LITTLE NENTL NO  HER NAME IS NE COL HE SAID SOMETHING LIKE AND WHEN YOU WERE LIVING IN RESN I THOUTMN IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH FRESNA THAT KIND OF THING SHE CONTITED OF PRIVATE INVESTIGATED TO RUN DOWN SOME TIPES SHE SUCH DEATH RECORDS FOR NE COL'S FATHER SHE FOUND DOZENS OF MATCHES AND SHE SOUTED NARROWING THEM DOWN CLOSING IN ON THE REAL JANE DO N COL MEANWHILE WAS THINKING VERY LITTLE ABOUT HER TIME AS JANEDO SHE LEFT FOSTE CAR AND WAS MAKING HER OWN LIFE AS AN ADULT SHE JOINED THE NAVY SHE WAS LEANING TO FLIND MILITARY HELICOPTIS AD SHE DECIDED TO BECOME A PSYCHOLOGIST SHE SAYS BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO BE LIKE COWAN SHE FELT SAFE WHEN SHE WAS TOKENG TO HIM AS A KID SHE WAS BEING LISTENED TO SHE WANTED TO MAKE ALTHER PEOPLE FEEL THAT WAY SHE SOUTED ACING HER PSYCHOLOGY CLASSES AT NIGHT WHILE SHE TRAINED AS A PILOT DURING THE DAY A COUPLE YEARSNIN TO HER MILITARY SERVICE STATIONED AN HOWAYY SHE GOT AN ODD PHONCOLL FROM A CLOSE FAMILY FRIEND SAID HEITHERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON THERS A PRIVE INVESTIGATOR LOOKING FOR YOU WHAT DID YOU THINK OH MAGASH WHEN ERTH WHAT ON EARTH WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW AND I KNEW WITHIN MOMENTS OF HEARING THE WORDS PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR THAT THIS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH DAPES JERNAL ARTICL IT WAS THE ONLY THING SHE'D EVER BEEN PATO THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO AN INVESTIGATOR SHE COLD COLWAN WHO LEARNED LOFTUS WAS BEHIND IT LOFTA INTERVIEWED NICHOLS FASTOMAM FORM A STEPMAM FAMILY FRIENDS WHO KNEW HER GROWING UP SHE'D EVEN INTERVIEWED NCHOL'S BI LOGICAL MUB AND SAID SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRONGLY ACCUSED NICHOL HEARING ABOUT LOFTIS WAS LIKE ABSOLUTELY NOT WHY DID YOU WANT HOW TO STOP I FELT INTRUDED UPON I FELT VIOLATED VERY VULNERABLE VERY EXPOSED AN AN I UNDERSTAND THAT PROBABLY SOUNDS WEIRD GIVEN THAT I HAD ALREADY GIVEN DIVE MY CONSENT TO PUBLISH A STORY ABOUT INTIMATE DETAILS OF MY LIFE BUT THERE'S A VERY VERY BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOME ONE ASKING YOU TO INVESTIGATE PARTS OF YOUR LIFE AND SOMEONE DOING SO WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE OR PERMISSION I DID EXCHANGE EMALES WITH HER AND I ASKED HER TO STOP WHAT SHE WAS DOING AND WHAT DID SHE SAY AND SO MANY WORDS NO DID SHE ASK YOU ANY DIRECT QUESTIONS WHILE SHE WAS LOOKING INTO THE CASE NO DID THAT STRIKE YOU AS KIND OF AUD IT STRUCK ME AS CIME INFURIATING NICHOLL COMPLAINED TO LOFTUS HIS UNIVERSITY WHO TOLD ER TO STOP INVESTIGATING THE JANE DO CASE I JUST GOT THE CALL FROM SOME ADMINISTRATOR ON MY CAMPUS SAY YOU KNOW ARE YOU LOOKING INTO THIS CASE I SAID YES ON LOOK ON THE END O THIS CASE AND A AND THEY CAME AND SEE TO MY FILES I MEAN I I I COULDN'T BELIEVE THIS WAS HAPPENING WHEN WHEN CAN WHEN CAN THE ADMINISTRATORS COME TO YOUR OFFICE AND JUST TAKE YOUR FILES LOFTAS WAS EVENTUALLY CLEARED AND SHE PUBLISHED HER FINDINGS ON JANEDUB SHE OGUED TO THE ABUSE MIGHT NEVER HAVE HAPPENED OF COURSE THIS WAS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT NICHOLL HAD BELIEVED AND CLUNG TO SINCE SHE WAS SEVENTANE LOTAS PRINTED EIGHT PAGES WORTH OF DOUBTS IN A MAGAZINE AND COLD THE AUDICLE WHO ABUSED JANE DO WHEN NICHOL HAD THE OUDICAL WAS ON STAND SHE TOOK A FRIEND FROM HE MILITARY BASE AND DROVE FIFTY MILES TO BONDS A NOBLE WHERE THEY STOOD SIDE BY SIDE READING IT IT WAS SO HURTFUL IT WAS SO RIDICULOUS TO ME THAT SOMEONE BASICALLY INTERVIEWED EVERYONE IN MY LIFE WHO HAD KNOWN ME WHEN I WAS A CHILD EXCEPT ME AND THEN WHEN AHAD AND HACH WORK TOGETHER THIS STORY THAT JUST SO HAPPENED TO COMPLETELY SUPPORT HER HYPOTHESIS HOW DAR SHE SHE JUST HAD NO RIGHT SHE JUST HAD NO RIGHT TO DO AS SHE DID WHOS STORY IS THIS THIS ISN'T JUST HER STORY THIS IS THIS IS THE FALSELY ACCUSED MOTHERS STORY THIS IS A WHOLE OTHER PEOPLE AR PART OF THIS STORY I DON'T THINK ONE PERSON GETS TO JUST ASIDE I MEN I ONLY TELL THE STORY ONE WAY AND ONLY LETE PEOPLE TELL IT WHO BELIEVE ME COMUNCRITICALLY WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE STORY I THOUGHT I WAS INVESTIGATING AN ACCUSATION AGAINST A POSSIBLY INNOCENT PERSON I DON'T THINK THE CLAIM IS THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST BELIEVED HER UN CRITICALLY I THINK I THINK NICHOL SAYS THAT THE WAY THAT YOU WENT AROUND THIS RAC SUCH WAS SO TROMATIZING AND DEMORALIZING TO HERLIKE SH IT MADE HER FEEL LIKE SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONTROL OF THA HER UNRECODS AND HER UNCH NFIDENTIAL INFORMATION FROM HER CHILDHOOD CAN YOU PUT YOURSELF IN HER SHOS THATLE CAN YOU UNDERSTAND WHY SHE FEELS LIKE THIS WAS AT TRESSPUS I WELL Y AS I I MEAN I THINK SHED SHE HAD HER AWAY OF OF TELLING HER STORY AND O AND SHE DIDN'T WANT THERE TO BE ANOTHER WAY AND AND THAND THAT MIGHT BE UPSETTING FOR HER I DON'T I IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME LIKE WHAT SHE WAS UPSET BY WAS THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER WAY OF TELLING THE STORY I THINK WHAT SHE FOUND OUPSETTING WAS THAT YOU FOUND OUT WHO SHE WAS AND LOOKED INTO HER LIFE WITHOUT ASKING HER WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT HER I WELL DON'T YOU THINK THAT THAT THAT THAT'S WHAT JOURNALIST DO ALL THE TIME USUALLY WHEN YOU WRITE A STORY ABOUT SOME ONE YOU CONTACT THEM WHAT YOU ASKED THEM WHAT THEY THINK OF THE THINGS THAT YOU FOUND OUT I ACTUALLY I YOU KNOW I I THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE TALKED TO HER I THINK I EVEN WROTE UP SOME QUESTIONS THAT I MIGHT ONT I ASK HER BUT IN THE AND WE WE DECIDED THAT IT WAS JUST TOO RISKY RISKY HOUT II JUST  REMEMBER THERE WERE GING TO BE CONDITIONS AND IN AND HIT JUST MADE US NERVOUS AND SO WE JECIDED WE WOULD JUST PUBLISH WHAT WE HAD FOUND OUT THROUGH MANY MANY OTHER SOURCES I AND O AND AND LEAVE IT AT THAT AND THAT THAT'S WHAT WE DID NICHOLL SUED WITH THE HELP OF A LAWYER WHO TOOK OUR CASE FOR FREE THEY WENT OFF TO LOFTIS AND EVERYONE WHO'D HELPED WRITE THE ARTICL FOR TWENTY ONE COMPLAINTS FROM DEFAMATION TO INVASION OF PRIVACY BUT EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS ANGRY WITH LOFTIS NICHOLL READ HER ARTICLE OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNTIL SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT SHE WASN'T EXPECTING SHE FOUND HERSELF AGREEING WITH LOFTIS A LITTLE IT PLANED TA SEETED DOUBT IT DID YES WHAT WAS THAT LIKE TO FEEL LIKE IS THIS THING THAT YOU'VE BEEN SO CERTAIN OF FOR SO LONG THAT YOU FELT LIKE YOU HAD RESOLUTION OF WITH DOCTOR COLWIN AND SEEING THOSE TAPES AND THEN TO HAVE IT BE THE SUBJECT OF DOUBT AGAIN WHAT DID THAT DUE TO YOU MAYME FEEL VERY SMALL  MAMY FEEL VERY INSIGNIFICANT AS THOUGH MY OPINION ON MY OWN THE EVENTS OF MY OWN LIFE R THE LEAST IMPORTANT NICHOLLS TOT A CHANGING HER MIND BACK AND FORTH OVER AND OVER SOME DAY SHE THOUGHT SHE'D BEEN ABUSED O THE DAYS SHE THOUGHT SHE'D LIED ABOUT IT I HAVE TO SAY A SOME ONE WHO SPENT MONTHS LOOKING INTO LOFTAS IS ARTICL IT IS REALLY HARD TO WORK OUT THE RESPONSIBLE THING TO THINK WHEN I FIRST READ IT I RMEMBER THINKING GAME OVE THERE'S NO WAY NICHOLLS MAMMA ABUSED HER BUT AS I LOOKED INTO EACH CLAIM LOFT IS MAD WHAT IT SEEMED LIKE A NINE ON THE CONVINCING TE SCALE TURNED OUT TO ME MORE LIKE A FOLL LI LOFT HAS FOUND A REPORT FROM A NOTHE PSYCHOLOGIST WHO INTERVIEWED YOUNG NICHOLL WE SAID SHE SOUNDED MECHANICAL AND REHERSE WHEN SHE TALKED ABOUT ABUSE LOFT HAS TOLD ME THAT WAS THE EVIDENCE THAT IMPRESSED HER MOST BUT I DON'T KNOW HE SAYS QUOT NICHOL HAS TOLD HER STORY NUMEROUS TIMES TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND SHE NOW SOUNDS MECHANICAL HE COULD MEAN NICHOLLS LYING WHL HE COULD JUST MEAN SHE'S BEEN OSTOTELL IT TOO MANY TIMES AND LOTUS INTOBEWED NICHOLLS HAT MA'M A WOMAN WH'D BEEN THERE FOR THE COSTIDY BATTLE SHE TOLD LOFTIS THAT SHE AND NICHOLL'S DAD HAD TRIED TO WIN COSTODY WITH WHAT SHE CALLED THE SEXUAL ANGLE LOFT HAS HEARD THAT AS SINISTER BUT DID SHE ACCIDENTALLY REVEALD THAT SHE'D HAD AN ANGENDER OR DID SHE JISUSE SEXUAL ANGLE AS AN UNFORTUNATE SHORTHAND LIKE SAYING WE ONE CUSTODY WITH THE ABUSED THING I TAKE THE BURNS LOFT HAS FOUND OUT THAT NICHOLL HAS A FUNGLE CONDITION THAT MAKES SKIN PEAL LIKE A HEALING BURN BUT THERE ARE PHOTOES OF YOUNG NICHOLL'S FEET WITH BIG BLISTERS COULD THEY BE EXPLAINED BY A FONGGIS IT GENUINELY TORMENTS ME I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK EVERY PIECE OF EVIDENCE SEEMS TO PINBLE BACK AND FORTH LIKE THIS I WENT MAD TRYING TO FIND OUT THE ANSWER I THOUGHT IF I READ ENOUGH COURT DOCUMENTS I'D FINALLY FIND THE ONE THING THAT NO ONE ELSE HAD THE THING THAT WOULD GIVE ME CERTAINTY EITHER WAY OF COURSE I DIDN'T AND NICOLL DIDN'T EITHER SHE SAT EVERY DAY IN THE SUSPENDED ANIMATION OF NOT KNOWING COURT BETWEEN TWO REALLY DISTRESSING WAYS OF SEEING HER PAST IN ONE HER MOTHER ABUSED ER IN THE OTHER HER FATHER MANIPULATED HER INTO LYING AND BECAUSE SHE LIED HER INNOCENT MOTHER WAS CUT OUT OF HER LIFE AND WRONGLY ACCUSED OF ABUSING HER CHILD IT JUST CREATED THIS BACK IN FORCE THAT I CONTINUE TO LIVE WITH TO DAY IT DID HAPPEN IT DIDN'T HAPPEN SOME DAYS I FALL SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN HOW DE SORIENTING WAS IT TO FEEL LIKE YOU HAD THE TRUTH AND THEN YOU LOST IT DISREANTING IS A GOOD WORD AN BUT IT I DON'T THINK IT FULLY CAPTURES AN IT GOES TOO MY IDENTITY IT REALLY GOES TO THE HEART OF WHO I AM AND WHO I THOUGT I WAS AND WHO I THINK I AM THE MOST IMPORTANT THE KEY MEMORY ON WHICH I REBUILT AND THEN REBUILT AGAIN MY IDENTITY HAS NOW BEEN CALLED INTO QUESTION IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING MULTIPLIED BY A MILLION IT'S JUST SO SO FRUSTRATING THERE IS AND INTANGIBLE TO BE GAINED FROM THE PROCESS OF TRANSITION FROM BEING A VICTIM TO BECOMING A SURVIVOR AND IN MY CASE NOW  THE SUDDEND I'M AN I NEITHER I DON'T KNOW AND I EITHER I I DON'T KNOW NICOLLS LORSID AGAINST ELIZABETH LOFTAS DRAGGED ON AND ON OVER FIVE YEARS ALL THE WAY OUT TO TE CALIFORNIA SUPREME CORD IN THE END NICHOLL LOST THE FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTED LOFTAS AS JOURNALIST AND NICOL HAD TO PAY LEGAL FEES NEARLY A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS WHICH SHE COULD NOT AFFORD THE COURT GUANISHED HER MILITARY WAGES SHE QUIT THE NAVY WHILST TWO HOUSES AND HER CAR WAS REPOSSESSED OVER ALL THIS SHE FILED FOR BANKRUPTSY   THESE DAYS INSTEAD OF BEING STUCK BETWEEN BELIEVING SHE WAS ABUSED AND BELIEVING THAT SHE WAS IT NICHOLL'S FOUND A THIRD OFTION SHE TRIES TO CARE A LITTLE LESS SHE CAN'T DIL DOWN THE UNCERTAINTY SO SHE TRIES TO DIAL DOWN THE STAKES I'M NEVER GOING TO KNOW I'M NEVER CAN KNOW AND I EVEN AFTER ALL THESE YEARS I THINK I STILL FOGT THAT AT SOME POINT I WOULD COME TO A SOLID DECISION YES OR KNOW AND REALLY REALLY I'M NEVER GOING TO KNOW AND THAT JUST HAS TO BE O KY THISS SO MUCH THAT NICOLLCOT BE CERTAIN OF SO SHE HAM MED OUT A CERTAINTY ABOUT HERSELF SHE FOUND AWAY FORWARD SHE BECAME A PILOT SHE GOT TWO MALSTES TO GREES IN A PEAGEDY IN PSYCHOLOGY SHE'S NOW A THERAPISST LI SHE'S WANTED SINCE SHE WAS SIX AND SHE'S NEVER CAUGHT HER MAMMA OUT OF HER LIFE NICHOLLSMAMM HAS ALWAYS SAID THAT SHE NEVER ABUSE NICHOLL SHE MAINTAINS THAT TO DAY AND SHE SAYS SHE DIDN'T TELL MICHALL TO LIE TO CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES I MOMS'N HAS SEVENTIES THEY LIVE IN THE SAME STATE IT'S NOT AN EASY RELATIONSHIP THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT I RUINED MY BIOLOGICAL MOTHER'S LIFE THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF GILT ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WE'RE CLOSE FER BE RELATIVELY CLOSE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN THINGS SORT O FALL APART AGAIN JUST AS THEY HAVE WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME HO SPOKE S FIVE MONTHS AGO AND WHAT WAS A LIKE IT STILL IT STILL AWKWARD IT'S STILL VERY PRESSURED IF YOU WILL O SHE STILL WANTS VERY MUCH FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT SHE NEVER DID ANYTHING TO ME IN AND I STILL DON'T KNO SO IT'S IT SHE REALLY REALLY HARD TO MOVE PAST THAT MAJOR SORT OF ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM DO YOU HAVE A TOK ABOUT IT NO IS SHE ABLE TO ACCEPT THAT YOU MIGHT JUST NON'T NO NO I THINKS SHE REALLY WANTS ME TO BELIEVE THAT SHE DIDN'T DO YOU THINK YOU COULD DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANYTHING THAT COULD CHANGE HER MIND NO THE WATERS ARE SO

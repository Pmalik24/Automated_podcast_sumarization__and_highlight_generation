HEAVEN MA CARTHY IS OUSED FROM HIS POSICION AS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE BY THE REPUBLICAN CIRCULAR FIRING SQUAD TRUMPS CIVIL FRAUD TROUT CONTINUES AND CRIMINALITYES FRIEDS ACROSS AMERICA'S MAJOR CITIES I' BENTURE OF THIS IS THE BENCH VIRO SHOW  TONA SHOS PONSFROM EXPRESS WE PIAN DO YOU LIE OR BYE PISTUR BEING SEEN AND SOLD TO ADVERTISERS NO MEANEITHER GET EXPESS WE PIAN RIGHT OUT EXPRESS WE PIANS I COUM FLASHMEN SO WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT THE GOP HAD PRETTY MUCH EVERY SYSTEMIC ADVANTAGE GOING INTO TWENTY TWENTY FOR THEY D DEEPLY UNPOPULAR PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES THE PROVAL RATINGS IN THE HIGH THIRITIES LOW FORTIES OF A PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES THE PROVALRATINGS ON THE ECONOMY IN THE THIRTIES OR TWENTIES WHAT IFE I TOLD YOU THAT THE GOP HADN'T ECONOMIC EDGE ON THE ISSUES THAT IS THEIR BIGGEST SINCE NINETEEN NINETY ONE WHELL WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT GOING INTO THE ELECTION THERE IS A VERY SOLID SHOT THAT JO BIDANS ECONOMIC POLICIES WERE GOING TO DRIVE AMERICA TRECTLY INTORESESSION WHAL ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE AND YET SOMEHOW REPUBLICANS HAVE COME UP WITH A BRAN NEW STRATEGY THIS STRATEGY IS TO JOIN IN IDIOCRASIDES MOVY FROM THE TWO THOUSANDS JOIN IN THE IDIOCRASY SHOW AL MY BALLS THIS IS THEIR ACTURAL STRATEGIES US TO KICK THEMSELVES OVER AND OVER IN THE BALLS UNTIL THEY WENT II CANNOT SEE ANY OTHER STRATEGY HERE I I DON'T KNOW WHY ITS HACPENING IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME IT IS INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE JOBIDAN NOTKE PRESIDENT OF TE UNITED STATES I'D LIKE TO SEE DEMOCRATS NOT MAKE POLICY FOR THE UNITED STATES I' LIKE THUCSURE MEN OT TO BE THE SENTI MAJORITY LEADER AND YET SINCE REPUBLICAN VICTORY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN REPUBLICANS HAVE LOST SOMETHNG LIKE ALEVEN GOVERNORSHIPS REPUBLICANS HAVE LOST SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY PLUST HOLICETES REPUBLICANS HAVE MOVED FROM A MAJORITY TOA MINORITY IN THE SENATE ALL IN THE FACE O WILDLY UNPOPULAR DEMOCRAT POLICIES THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS MOVED TO THE RATICAL LEFT THEY CONTINUE TO MUROR ALL THE POLICIES OF THE RATICAL LEFT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THEM ON ANY OF THE ISSUES AND YET DEMOCRATS KEEP GETTING ELECTED AND SO THE QUESTION BECOMES WHY WHY WOULD THAT BE WELL MAY BE THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE REPUBLICANS ARE STRATEGICALLY EN APT MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE ESSENTIALLY DECIDED THAT PROTEST VOTES ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN ACTUAL VOTES MAYBE THEY'VE DECIDED THAT DOWSING THEMSELVES IN GAZOLINE AND SETTIN A MATCH IS IS PROBABLY THE BEST STRATEGY I NOL IT STRATEGY FOUR OTHER THAN MAY BE FEELING GOOD FOR A BRIEF MOMENT IN TIME BECASIF WE SHOW FRUSTRATION TO OUR LEADERSHIP CLASS THON FOR SURE WELL GET A NEW LEADERSHIP CLASS AND THEN SOME ODY ALL CENTERS LIKE WAIT POLLON THE INCENSIVE STRUCTURES EXACTLY THE SAME AN THOMAS SOL SAYS VERY FREQUENTLY WITH REGARD TO POLITICS THAT PEOPLE BIG MISTAKE WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICS IS BELIEVING THAT THE PROBLEM WITH THE POLITICIANS IS THE POLITICIANS RATHER THAN THE INCENTIVE STRUCTURE THAT CREATES THE POLITICIANS AND THAT IS EXACTLY CORRECT REPUBLICANS HAVE NOW REPLACED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS PAULRIANAT SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE JON BANER A SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NOW CEVMACARTHEA SPEAKER THE HOUSE WHAT IS CHANGED SERIOUSLY WHAT IS CHANGED WHAT WHAT MAGICAL NEW THINGS HAVE HAPPENED FROM THE REPLACEMEN OF ANY OF THE SPEAPLE A SPEAKER OF TE HUSE NOW I WAS NOT A BANER OFAN I DIDN'T WANT BANER TO BE SPEAKER F THE HOUSE HAVE OG UAS FIR TO CONCILIATORY TOR BARACOBAMA I THOUGHT PAULRINE WAS FINE I'V OUHT COME MAC CARTHY WAS FINE WHAT APPARENTLY WE TEN TO BE OPERATING UNDER THE WILD DELUSION THAT IF WE SIMPLY REPLACE ONE SPEAKER WIT ANOTHER SPEAKER AND LEAVE THE INCENTS OF STRUCTURE EXACTLY THE SAME THEN EVERYTHING WILL BE YO BETTER THINGS WILL CHANGE THAT IS NOT HOW ANY OF THIS WORKS THE INCENT IVE STRUCTURE RIGHT NOW IN THE HOUSE F REPRESENTATIVE JUST TAKE THE LATEST EXAMPLE BECAUSE YESTERDAY CEM MCARTHY WAIS OUTSET IS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE FOR NO REASON I CAN DISCERN BY EIGHT REPUBLICANS WHO JOIN WITH ALL DEMICRATS TO AUSE MAC CARTHY WHICH MEANS THAT NINETY SIX PERCENTS OF THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS VOTED IN FAVOR OF CEMMICARTHY AND MICARTHY IS NO LONGER THESPEAKER BECAUSE O THT AT HOUSE REPUBLICAN WHO DECIDED THAT MC CHARTHY HAD TO GO FOR A REASON THAT NO ONE CAN ACTUALLY DISCERN OR SPECIFY THE INCENT OF STRUCTURE RIGHT NOW UNFORTUNATELY FOR A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IS GAT FAMOUS RUN FOR A HIGHER OFFICE WIN OR LOSE DOESN'T REALLY MATTER CLEAN UP PICK UP SOME CHACKS START A PACK STARTAN ON PROFIT MOVE IN TO A DIFFERENT AERIA OF YOUR CAREER THIS IS A DIFFERENT INCENSE OF STRUCTURE THE USE TO BE WHEN PARTIES WERE MORE POWERFUL THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO PUNISH THEIR MEMBERS NOW THAT WAS BAD IN SOME WAYS BECAUSE IT MEANT THE PARTY LEADERSHIP ACTUALLY MATTERED AN AWFUL LOT BECAUSE THE PARTY LEADERSHIP COULD DECIDE THE DIRECTION OF THE PARTY AND BECAUSE OF THAT THE PARTY STRUCTURE WAS WEAKENED WELL THE RESULT OF THAT IS THAT THERE IS A MASSIVE COLLECTIVE ACTION PROBLEM WHEREBY A FEW PEOPLE CAN HOLD HOSTAGE THE ENTIGH REPUBLICAN CAUCUS FOR NO REASON THAT ANY ONE CAN CAN EXPLAIN YEN IN ORDER TO REALY UNDERSTAND HOW DUMB ALL OF THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT KEVEN MAC CARTHY WAS BY PRETTY MUCH ANY MEASURE THE MOST CONSERVATIVE SPEAKER THE REPUBLICANS HAVE HAD SINCE NEW GINGRIDCH THE HE ACHIEVED ACTUAL WINDS AGAINST JOBIDON THE LAST CONTINUING RESOLUTION THAT THE PEOPLE WHO OUSTED HIM ARE VERY ANGRY ABOUT HE PROPOSED A BETTER ONE TWO WEEKS AGO THAT THEY THAT THY SCUTTLED THEY SAID WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH AND S THEY SCUTTLED IT AND SO HE HAD TO PASS A CONTINUING RESOLUTION AND EVEN THEN HE STRIPPED OUT FUNDING FOR THE CRANEWOR AND SOMEHOW HE'S TH VAGGI AND THIS IS NOT THAT CEMMICRTHY LIKE THE MOST AMAZING POLITICION OFALL TIME HE THAT HE HE WOULD BE THE GREATEST SPEAKER IN HISTORY IT'S HE GOT NO REPLACEMENT E GOT NO STRATEGY THIS ALL GRAND STANDING NONSENSE THERE'S NO PURPOSE TO IT WHAT WINDS ARE YOU ARE YOU ATTEMPTING T  I SAID THIS DURING THE ORIGINAL SPEAKERSHIP FIGHT BACK IN JANUARY CHIPROY WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO MAY BE CONSIDERED FOR THE SPEAKERSHIP SLOT IF HE WANTS IT OU KNOW WY ANY ONE IN THE WORLD WOULD WANT THAT JOB IS A HORRIBLE JOB IT IS THE SECOND WORSJOB IN A MERICA BEHIND DONALDS FROMS PERSONAL LAWYER I  I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT CHIPROY DID NOT WANT THIS BOT GE BUT INICATE CHIPROY BACK IN JANUARY HE SAID I WANT CERTAIN CONCESSIONS FROM A CARTHY AND THEN HE GOT THEM AND THEN HE SAID O CEMICARTHY SHOULD SHOULD BE SPEAKER THAT'S A PLAN BUT THIS IS NOT A PLAN THIS IS JUST PEOPLE RANTING AND RAVING AGAIN THIS IS LEBEROY JANKINS CAN GRESSIONAL VERSION IS BEAL RUNNING FOR NO REASON INTO A BRICK WALL AND THEN DECLARING VICTORY AS THEY BLEED IT'S IT'S AN AMAZING THING AAGAINST TO TRULY UNDERSTAND HOW DONE THIS HE OUST UNDERSTAND HOW VULNABLE DEMOCRATS ARE AND TO UNDERSTAND A VULNERABLE DEMOCRATES ARE LETTHIM GIVE YOU JUST THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IN THE UNITED STATES

LEVEL FOR LONGER THE THIRTY YEAR TREASURY YIELD HAT FOUR POINT NINE TWO FIVE PER CENT THAT IS ALSO THE HIGHEST SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WHICH MEANS THE MONEY IS NOW RUSHING OUT OF STOCKS AND BACK INTO BONDS BUT IT ALSO MEANS THAT WHOD PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING THEN IN FLEETION COULD BE BAKED INTO THE ECONOMY THAT'S THE ONLY REASON THE INTEREST RACER CAN BE STUCK THIS HIGH MARKET WATCH HAS AN ENTIRE ARTICLE TO DAY TALKIG ABOUT HOW GOVERNMENT BOND YIELDS ARE RIPPING THROUGH LOBAL MARKETS BY THE WAY WHEN THE WHEN THE BONDS THAN AMERICA IS SELLING HAVE A FATUALLY HIGHER RATE THAT MEANS THE NATIONAL

STARSARTLINEWHEN YOU'RE PERSONAL POLITICAL BENEFITS RUN DIRECTLY AGAINST THE INTEREST OF THE PARTY AT LARGE OR THE MOVEMENT AT LARGE THE INSTENTIVE STRUCTUR RIGHT NOW SAYS THER GANA ALWAYS BE ROGUE ACTORS WHO ARE ABLE TO DO THIS SORT OF THING IT'S A PROBLEM WELL GET TO THE ACTUAL BREAK DOWN ON HOW THIS HAPPEND IN JUST ONE AT MOMENT FIRST BASEPALL SEASON IS OFFICIALLY OVER THAT' DOES NOT MEAN THE FUN HASTO AND THATS BECAUSE PRIZEPICS OFFERS PROJECTIONS ON PETTY MUCH EVERY SPORT THERE IS AN B A M L B AND A FELL ANY CHAL PECIE COLLEGE SPORTS EASPORTS AN ASK OUR TENNIS AMAMADE DISCALT WHATEVER

TURNS OUT THAT THE PERSONAL INSENTEVCE DID NOT A LINE WITH THE REST OF THE REPUBLICAN INSENTIVES SO FOR PESENT OF THE CACAS TAKES HIW THE OTHER NINETY SIX PERCENT OF THE CAUCAS MC CARTHY SAID KEEPING THE GOVERMENT OPEN WAS THE RIGHT DECISION BECAUSE WE HAD NO ALTERNATIVES THAT THE BUILL THAT I TRIED TO ADVANCE WAS OPPOSED BY THE SAM PEOPLE TRYING TO KEEK ME OUT OF SPEAKERSHIP NOW I HAD A LOT OF REPUBLICANS THAT WON ME TO DO IT I NEVER DID IT THE MANCY AND I GET NO WE REALLY DON'T GET ALONG BUT I THOUGHT THE INSTATUTION WAS TOO IMPORTANT ANDI THOUGHT THAT WAS TOO PERSONAL WHICH HEU KNOW AT

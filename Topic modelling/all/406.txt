YOU AND NOW WITHOUT FURTHER ADO I WILL ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AND AS ALWAYS I WILL STRIVE TO BE AS THOROUGH AS POSSIBLE AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE AND AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE THE FIRST QUESTION IS ABOUT I HEALTH IN PARTICULAR I HEALTH PROTOCALLS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE AGE ING BUT I HEALTH PROTOCALLS FOR PEOPLE IN GENERAL THE QUESTION IS I'M NOTICING THAT MY VISION BOTH CLOSE AND FAR IS DETERIORATING WHAT ARE THE BEST I EXERCISES I HEALTH BEHAVIORS SUPPLEMENTS ET CETERA FOR THE AGING EYE SO THE ANSWER I'M ABOUT TO PROVIDE APPLIES TO EVERYBODY REGARDLESS OF AGE WHICH IS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU VIEW THINGS BOTH CLOSE UP AND FAR AWAY ACROSS YOUR DAY MANY MANY PEOPLE NOWADAYS SPEND A LOT OF TIME LOOKING AT THEIR SMARTPHONE LOOKING AT THE COMPUTER SCREEN LOOKING AT BOOKS IN PAPER IN OTHER WORDS LOOKING AT THINGS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN NINE INCHES AWAY FROM THEIR FACE AND THEIR EYES MAY BE TWO AND A HALF FEET AWAY FROM THEIR FACE AND EYES THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED EVENT IN HUMAN HISTORY AS FAR AS WE KNOW BECAUSE IT WASN'T UNTIL THE ADVENT OF THE SMARTPHONE THAT WE'VE SPENT SO MUCH TIME LOOKING AT SCREENS AT CLOSE RANGE RELATIVE TO LOOKING AT THINGS AT FURTHER DISTANCES FROM OUR FACE THROUGHOUT THE DAY IN FACT IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE THAT THE INCIDENTS OF MYOPIA OF NEAR SIGHTEDNESS IS INCREASING DRAMATICALLY AROUND THE WORLD BUT IS INCREASING PARTICULARLY FAST IN CHILDREN AND IN YOUNG ADULTS AND EVEN AN ADULTS WHO ARE VIEWING THINGS AT VERY CLOSE RANGE SO TWO ANDA HALF FEET OR LESS NOW I AM NOT SAYING THAT VIEWING THINGS THAT DWO AND A HALF FEET OR LESS IS BAD FOR YOUR EYES THAT IS SIMPLY NOT THE CASE HOWEVER IF YOU WANT YOUR VISION TO BE MAINTAINED OR EVEN IMPROVE IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO VIEW THINGS AT A DISTANCE AS WELL FOR I GEALLY SEVERAL HOURS PER DAY OW REALISE SOME PEOPLE JUST SIMPLY WON'T ACCOMPLISH THIS IN FACT I'D LIKE EVERYONE AT JUST TAKE A MOMENT AND DO A ROUGH ESTIMATION IN YOUR HEAD OF HOW MUCH TIME DURING YOUR DAY TIME ACTIVITIES YOU ARE VIEWING THINGS AT SAY TWO AND A HALF FEET OR THREE FEET OR LESS O SMARTPHONE COMPUTER SCREEN PAPER BOOKS ET CETERA VERSES VIEWING THINGS THAT ARE FOUR FEET AWAY EIGHT FEET AWAY SO MAY BE CONVERSATION ACROSS THE TABLE WITH ANOTHER HUMAN BEING REMER THOSE A SOME OF US ARE DOING THAT MORE NOW THAT WE SEEM TO BE EMERGING FROM THIS WHOLE NOPANDEMIC PHASE HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE ARE STILL MOSTLY JUST VIEWING THINGS WITHIN VERY CLOSE RANGE AND IN FACT IF YOU WERE TO ASK YOURSELF HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU SPEND LOOKING AT THINGS AT THE DISTANCE OF MANY HUNDREDS OF FEET OR TAKING A WALK WHERE YOU'ARE NOT LOOKING AT ANY SCREEN AND YOU'RE SIMPLY LETTING VISUAL IMAGES WHERE THE VISUAL IMAGERY RATHER PASS BY ON YOUR EYES I THINK FOR MOSET OF US THAT NUMBER IS GETTING PROGRESSIVELY SMALLER AND SMALLER WITH EACH PASSING YEAR SO THIS IS AN ISSUE BECAUSE THE STRUCTURE OF THE EYE IS SUCH THAT THE LENS OF THE EYE CAN MOVE BUT ALSO THAT THE LENGTH OF THE EYEBALL FROM FRONT TO BACK IS ACTUALLY IMPACTED BY HOW CLOSE OR HOW FAR YOU HAPPEN TO VIEW THINGS DURING THE COURSE OF YOUR DAY ESPECIALLY DURING DEVELOPMENT THERE'S A CLASSIC EXPERIMENT THAT'D LIKE TO JUST BRIEFLY DESCRIBE TO YOU WHICH HAS BEEN PERFORMED IN CHICKENS IT'S BEEN PERFORMED IN MICE IT'S ALSO BEEN PERFORMED ON HUMANS WHERE A VISUAL A CLUDER OR A VISUAL IMAGE SO INCLUDER IS JUST A IN A BLACK A S OR SCREEN OR PIECE OF CARDBOARD OR IN A IMAGE MAY BE SOME UNOBLACK AND WHITE CHECKS OR CHECKERS ARE PLACED AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE FROM THE EYE EITHER UP CLOSE OR FAR AWAY AND THE IMPACT OF THAT ON THE LENGTH OF THE EYEBALL AND ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE LENS AND ON THE QUALITY IN A CUITY OF VISION IS THEN MEASURED AND TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT WHAT THESE STUDY SHOW IS THAT IF DURING DEVELOPMENT YOU OR AN ANIMAL EXCLUSIVELY LOOKS AT THINGS THAT ARE UP CLOSE VERY CLOSE TO THE EYE AND DOESN'T EVER GET LONG RANGE VISION THE EYEBALL LENGTHENS AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS THE LENS WHICH A COURSES IN THE FRONT OF THE EYEBALL WHICH FOCUSSES THE LIGHT ON TO THE BACK OF THE EYEBALL WHICH IS WHERE THE SO CALL NURL RETINA IS WHERE THE SELLS THAT SENSE LIGHT AR THAT VISUAL IMAGE LANDS IN FRONT OF AS OPPOSE TO DIRECTLY ON THE LIGHT SENSING PORTION OF THE EYEBALL  WE CALL THE NURRL RETINA IT LANDS TOO CLOSE OR NEAR THE LENDS AS UPPOSED ON THE BACK OF THE EYEBALL AND THAT'S PAR OF THE REASON WHAT WE CALL THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT NEAR SIGHTED MYOPIA IN FARSIHTEDNESS THE OPPOSITE HAPPENS THE VISUAL IMAGES ACTUALLY FOCUSSED BEHIND THE RETNA IT DOESN'T LAND DIRECTLY ON THEIR RETNA WHICH IS WHAT YOU WANT ITS FOCUSE TOO FAR BEHIND THE RETINA AND THAT'S DUE TO A SHORTENING OF THE EYEBALL SO WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED ACTUALLY EXPLAINS PRETTY WELL WHY KIDS WHO LOOK AT COMPUTER SCREENS ARE BOOKS UP CLOSE OFTEN NEED GLASSES  YEN N WHEN I WAS GROWING UP THEY CALL THIS NERD CYNDRUM RAISING MY HAND FOR THOSE WHO THER LISTENING I READ AN AWFUL LOT A BUT I ALSO SPEND TIME OUTSIDE FORTUNATELY AND RUNNING ROUND ON THE SOCKERFIELD AND LOOKING THINGS IN THE DISTANCE AND UM PLAYING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH MY FRIENDS KIDS THAT SPEND THE VAST AMOUNT OF THEIR TIME LOOKING AT THINGS UP CLOSE AND PARTICULAR CHILDREN WHO DO THAT INDOORS FOR MOSE OF THEIR WAKING TIME WELL THOSE KIDS DEVELOP MY OPIA THIS IS PARTHER REASON WHY WE HAVE SUCH A AM AN INCREASE OF THE INCIDENTS OF MYOPIA NOWADAYS WHAT'S INTERESTING AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS THAT EVEN AS A YOUNG ADULT AN ADULT AND PERHAPS EVEN AS AN OLDER ADULT AN ELDERLY PERSON LOOKING AT THINGS UP CLOSE TOO MUCH AT THE EXPENSE OF GETTING SOME TIME VIEWING THINGS AT A DISTANCE IN PARTICULAR OUTDOORS CAN BE VERY PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE IT CAN EXASCERBATE MYOPIA SO THE SHORT DIRECT PRESCRIPTION HERE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE GETTING AT LEAST AN HOUR OR SO EACH DAY ALTHOUGH IDEALLY IT WOULD BE MORE OF LONG VIEWING AND THAT CAN BE DONE BY WALKING OUTSIDE AND AVOIDING LOOKING AT YOURPHONE WHILE W ALKING DOESN'T REQUIRE THT YOU LOOK AT A PARTICULAR OBJECT IN THE DISTANCE ALTHOUGH IF YOU ARE SCANDING FOR AND LOOKING FOR OBJECTS IN THE DISTANCE ATHE WAY THAT A YOU MIGHT ON A HIGHACHE OR YOU'RELOOKING A OUT TORD OR OFF A A VISTA YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOME ONE IN THE DISTANCE ALL OF THAT SORT OF VISUAL SCANNING BEHAVIOUR IS GOING TO BE VERY GOOD FOR YOUR EYE HEALTH AND FOR MAINTAINING VISION AT A DISTANCE IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO'S FAR SIGHTED AND YOU HAVE TROUBLE SEEING THINGS UP CLOSE WELL THEN YOU NEED ASK YOURSELF WHETHER NOT YOU'R SPENDING TO MUCH TIME LOOKING AT THINGS OFF IN THE DISTANCE ALTHOUGH I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT NEAR SIGHTEDNESS AND FARSIGHTEDNESS AREN'T NECESSARILY THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS NEAR FAR VIEWING THERE CAN BE INDEPENDENT CAUSES OF NEAR SIDEDNESS AND FARSIDENESS BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE SPENDING PROGRESSIVELY MORE AND MORE TIME JUST LOOING AT THINGS UP CLOSE YOU CAN GET THIS LENGTHENING OF THE EYEBALL OR CHALLENGES IN THE WAY THAT THE ELASTICITY OF THE LENDS IS CONTROLLED BY THE MUSCULATURE IN WAYS THAT MAKE IT HARD TO MAINTAIN SHARP CRISPVISION WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT THINGS AT A DISTANCE ARE UP CLOSE K SO I CAN'T BECAUSE THERE ARE SIMPLY NO STUDIES TO SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT YOU NEED EXACTLY TWO HOURS PER DAY OF OUTSIDE LONG VISION OF PARTICULAR DISTANCE AND OR THAT YOU WANT A CUT OFF OR HAVE A THRESHOLD OF IN FOUR HOURS PER DAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS UP CLOSE BUT WE CAN'T SAY WITH A HIGHTDEGREE OF CONFIDENCE THAT IF YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN OR ENHANCE YOUR VISION AT ALL DISTANCES THAT FOR EVERY HOUR OR SO THAT YOU SPEND LOOKING AT THINGS SAY A DISTANCE OF THREE FEET AWAY OR LESS YOU WANT TO GET AT LEAST ONE HOUR PER DAY TOTAL DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ALL AT ONCE OF LOOKING AT THINGS OUT IN THE DISTANCE OR LOOKING AT THINGS BEYOND THREE FEET A RELATIVE TO THE DISTANCE FROM YOUR EYE K SO I THINK FOR SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY BADLY MY OPIC ATHIS ISN'T GOING TO REMEDY THAT MYOPIA YOU'ARE STILL GOING TO NEED CORRECTIVE LENSES BUT IF YOUARE SOMEBODY SIMILAR TO THE PERSON WO ASKED THE QUESTION THAT THEYARE QOTN QUOT NOTICING THEIR VISION IS DETURIATING REALLY TRYING BALANCE OUT THE AMOUNT OF VIEWING THAT YOU'RE DOING AT CLOSE DISTANCE AND LONG DISTANCE AND AND I WOULD NOT OBSESS ABOUT THE TOTAL NUMBERS YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THREE HOURS IN THREE HOURS BUT THE MORE TIME THAT YOU CAN SPEND AT VIEWING THINGS AT VARIABLE DISTANCE THROUGHOUT THE DAY THE BETTER OFF YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN MAINTAINING AND PERHAPS EVEN NHANCING YOUR VISION SOMEWHAT NOW THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL BEHAVIOURAL TOOL THAT WE CAN GLEAN FROM THE RECENT SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE EXPLORING MYOPIA WHICH POINTS TO THE FACT THAT CHILDREN WHO GET TWO HOURS THE DAY OR MORE OF TIME OUTSIDE IN SUNLIGHT IONE OF MY FAVORITE TOPICS I KNOW A MANY PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY ROLLING THEIR EYES RIGHT NOW A WHEN THEY HEAR ME SAY YOU REALLY WANT YOU MORNING SUNLIGHT NOT THROUGH WINDOW OR INSHIELD DON'T WHERE SUNGLASSES FOR THAT TRINKETMUCH SUNLIGHTAS YOU CAN IN YOUR EYES EARLY IN THE DAY NEVER STARE AT ANY LIGHT SO BRIGHT ATS PAINFUL LOOKOT ET CETERA DONE A LOT OF EPISODES ON THIS WE HAVE A LIGHT FOR HEALTH EPISODE THIS IS AN ALL THE SLEEP EPISODES ITS JUST SUCH A BASIC FOUNDATION OF CIRCATIAN RHYTHM IN HEALTH THAT I JUST KEEP REPEATING IT HOWEVER THERE ARE ALSO LARGE SCALE CLINICAL TRIALS INVOLVING THOUSANDS OF SUBJECTS THEYHAVE SHOWN THAT PEOPLE CHILDREN IN PARTICULAR WHO GET TWO HOURS OR MORE OF OUTSIDE TIME EVERY DAY HAVE A MUCH LOWER INSTANCE OF MYOPIA NOW WHIT'S REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT THESE STUDIES IS THAT WHILE SOME OF THOSE KIDS ARE LOOKING AT THINGS FURTHER OFF IN THE DISTANCE THAN THEY WOULD IF THEY WERE INDOORS ON THEIR TABLETS OR SCREENS OR WITH THEIR NOSE IN A BOOK IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE THE CASE THAT THEY HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT THINGS IN THE DISTANCE IN ORDER TO SEE THIS REDUCED INCIDENTS OF MYOPIA WHAT'S PROBABLY HAPPENING INSTEAD IS THAT THE PARTICULAR WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT THAT EMANATE FROM THE SUN THAT POTON ENERGY IN PARTICULAR IS TRIGGERING THE ACTIVATION OF THESE SO CALLED INTRINSICALLY SENSITIVE MELONOPS AND RETINAL GANGLING CELLS WHICH WE KNOW OURE IMPORTT FOR SETTING CIRCATIANG RHYTHM FOR ENHANCING MOOD FOCUS AN ALERTNESS DURING THE DAY AND ENHANCING THE QUALITY IN DURATION OF SLEEP AT NIGHT BUT THOSE MELONOPS AND INTRINSICALLY PHOTOSENSITIVE GANGLIAN ELLS ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN NETWORKS WITHIN THE EYE THAT RELATE TO BLOOD FLOW THAT RELATE TO THE A THE CILIARY BODY WHICH IS A STRUCTURE WITHIN THE EYE THAT CONTROLS A THE APERTURE AND MOVEMENT OF SOME KEY COMPONENTS WITHIN THE EYE THAT ALSO RELATE TO THE CRISPNESS OF VISION THAT IS THE ACUTYA VISION AT BOTH SHORT AND LONG RANGE SO THERE ARA LOT OF TECHNICAL DETAILS THERE IN FACT IM I REALLY HOPE TO GET A THE GREAT RUSVAN GELDER OR DOCTOR RUSVAN GELDER WHO'S THE CHAIR OF OPTHEMOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSYA WASHINGTON IN SEATTLE WHO IS A WORLD EXPERT IN THIS AND THE VARIOUS ASPECTS BOTH MOLECULAR AND STRUCTURAL OF THE CILIARY BODY IN THE LENS AND IS AN EXPERT IN UVIITIS A VERY INTERESTING TOPIC IN ITS OWN RIGHT TO COME ON TO THE PODCASTS AND TALK MORE ABOUT EYE HEALTH AND WEWE WILL DO THAT IN THA NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE MEANWHILE IF THE FIRST BEHAVOUR AL PROTOCAL FOR ENHANCING AN MAINTAINING EYE HEALTH IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE SPENDING AT LEAST SOME TIME BALANCING OUT THE NEAR VISION IN FAR VISION DURING THE DAY IT ALSO STANDS TO REASON THAT YOU WANT TO GET OUTSIYDE FOR AT LEAST TWO HOURS TO DAY WHICH I KNOW SOUNDS LIKE A LOT IN ORDER TO PREVENT MY OPIA IF YOUR YOUNG PERSON AND OFFSET THE PROGRESSION OF IT MAYBE EVEN REVERSE SOME IOPIA WE DON'T KNOW YET BASED ON THE DATA BUT THERE'RE SOME INDICATION THAT'S POSSIBLE BY GETTING OUTSIDE TWO HOURS TO DAY AND THE COOL THING IS BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO WHEN WE NEED TO BE ON OUR PHONES QUITE A LOTTER WE CHOOSE TO BE ON OUR PHONES QUITE A LOT THIS EFFECT OF GETTING SUNLIGHT OUTDOORS DURING THE DAYTIME FOR TWO HOURS OR MORE DOES NOT SEEM TO REQUIRE THAT YOU STAY IT OFF YOUR PHONE OR TABLETER THAT YOUR LOOKING AT THINGS FAR IN THE DISTANCE THE ENTIRE TIME WHAT THIS MEANS IS IF YOU CAN GET OUTSIDE ON TO A PATIO OR A DECK OR YOU KNOW AN OUTDOOR TABLE IF YOU CAN IF WEATHER IN CONDITIONS PERMIT AND DO SOME OF YOUR PHONE TIME AND COMPUTER TIME AND READING ET CETERA OUTDOORS NOW IF YOU'RE ALREADY MAKING AN EFFORT TO GET OUTSIDE HEIGHT PLACE SPORTS IM TAKE WALKS ET CETERA THAT OF COURSE COUNTS TOWARDS THIS TWO HOUR THRESHOLD AND I KNOW THIT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT THIS TWO HOURS AND YET FOR MOST PEOPLE  CERTAINLY WILL VARY DEPENDING ON TIME OF YEAR BUT I THINK STRIVING TO GET ON AVERAGE ABOUT TWO HOURS ABOUT DOOR TIME AS MUCH AS YOU CAN OR OPENING OR WINDOW WHICH WOULDN'T BE AS GOOD AS GETTING OUTSIDE BUT OPENING A WINDOW AND TRYING TO GET SOME NATURAL LIGHT EXPOSURE TO THE AT ED TRIGGER THE ACTIVITY THESE INTRINSICALLY PHOTOCENS OF MELNOPS AND RETNAL GANGLING SELLS THAT'S GOING TO BE A REALLY GOOD IDEA IN TRYING TO OFFSET MAYBE EVEN REVERSE SOME VISION LOSS NOW THE OTHER BEHAVIORAL PROTOCOLS WHICH YOU'VE SHOWN TO BE USEFUL IN TERMS OF MAINTAINING OR IMPROVING VISION RELATE TO THE MUSCULATURE AROUND THE EYE AND THE CONTROL OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE LENS AND ACTUALLY THE LENS OF THE EYE HAS ITS OWN CONT IF FLEXIBILITY ITS A REALLY REALLY INTERESTING STRUCTURE AM I'LL GEEK OUT ON THIS FAR TOO LONG IF A IF I DON'TPREVENT MYSELF FROM DOING SO BUT THE LENS IS JUST INCREDIBLE THE FACT THAT IT HAS A SPECIFIC STRUCTURE OF PROTINES LIKE CRYSTALLINS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT AND THAT IT CAN A STILL DERIVED NOURISHMENT FROM BLOOD FLOW BUT DOES NOT ACTUALLY HAVE VASCULATURE WITHIN IT SO IT'S NOT IF YOU NOTICE THEM MEN THAT THE LENS OF YOUR EYES AND FILLED WITH BLOOD VESSELS IN CAPULARIES CAUSE IT NEEDS LIGHT TO PASS THROUGH SUPERINTERESTING STRUCTURE AM I THINK THE ONLY VIOLATION OF WHAT I JUST SAID IS THE MANITY I AN'T THOSE BIGS OR UNDER WATER ELEPHANT LIKE CREATURES THAT AM I THINK WERE ARE ENDANGERED DOWN IN FLORIDA THEY WERE GETTING CHOPPED UP BY SPEED BOATS BUT I THINK NOW THERE SOME EFFORT TO PRESERVE THOSE THIG GENTLE GIANTS THE MANITY AS I RECALL HAS A VASCULRARIZED LENS WHICH IS WHY THEIR EYES LOOCOPAQUE IT LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE CATARACTS A IN ANY CASE YOU'RE NOT A MANITY YOU HAVE NO BLOOD VESSEL SUPPLY TO TO THE LENS KEEPING THAT LENS CLEAR IS VIDAL NOWADAYS THAT YOU CAN THEY CAN DO LENS REPLACEMENT IS REALLY A A PRETTY INCREDIBLE A PROGRESS IN THE IN THE REALM OF OPTHEMAL G AND SURGICAL REPLACEMENT OF THE LENS OR THE CORNIA OF THEIR ASPECTS OF THE EYE BUT IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO IS INTEREST IN MAINTAINING YOUR VISION YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO MAINTAIN THE MUSCULATURE THAT CONTROLS THE MOVEMENT AN THE CHANGE OF SHAPE IN THAT LENDS AND THE MOVEMENT OF THE EYES WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO TRANSITION YOUR VISION FROM VERY SHARP WHEN VIEWING THINGS UP CLOSE TO VERY SHARP WHEN VIEWING THINGS AT A DISTANCE AND THIS IS WHERE SOME OF THE SO CALLED NEAR FAR EXERCISES CAN BE VERY USEFUL SO WHEN WE DID A FULL LENGTH PODCAST ON EYE HEALTH AND IMPROVING EYESIGHT WHICH I INVITE YOU TO LISTEN TO IF YOU LIKE TALKED ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF VISION EXERCISES THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE USEFUL FOR IMPROVING VISION AT THE LEVEL OF A CUITY THAT HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH IMPROVING THE MUSCULATURE AND THE MOVEMENT TO THE EYES AND THE LENS AND THAT'S WHAT'S CALL THE SMOOTH PURSUIT TASK SO YOU COULD GO ON TO YOU TO IF YOU LIKE AND PUT SMOOTH PURSUIT I TASK AND DOU THIS FOR A FEW MINUTES EACH DAY IF YOU'RE TRYING TO KEEP YOUR VISION STRONG AND WHAT THAT TASK INVOLVES IS AS THE NAME SUGGESTS SMOOTHLY TRACKING A SMALL DOT OR CROSS HATCH OR ARROW ON THE SCREEN WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE SO CALLED SICOD TYPE I'VE MOVEMENTS THAT WE OFTEN MAKES A CODS ARE WHEN YOU DART YOUR EYES TO A PARTICULAR LOCATION TO LOOK AT SOMETHING THAT DART IT TO ANOTHER LOCATION TO LOOK AT SOMETHING MICROS ICODS ARE LITTLE TINY VERSIONS OF THOSE THAT WERE DOING MOST ALL OF THE TIME BELIEVEIT OR NOT WHEN YOU LOOK AT AVISUAL SCENE OR IMAGE IF YOU DID NOT HAVE THOSE LITTLE MICRO CICODS YOUR BRAIN WOULD ADAPTOR WOULD ATTENUATE TO WHATEVER YOU WERE LOOKING AT AND THE VISUAL IMAGE WOULD ACTORY DISAPPEAR WHICH REALLY SPEAKS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT YOUR PERCEPTIONS CHANGE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THEM THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHEREIF SOMETHING IS PLACED ON YOUR A HAND SAY A FINGER YOU'LL NOTICE THAT CHANGE BUT THEN IF YOU LEAVE IT THERE FOR A SHORT WHILE YOU'LL FORGET THAT IT'S THERE BECAUSE THE CELLS THERE OF ADAPTED OUT THERE'S NO CHANGE TO YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS LARGELY RESPONDING TO CHANGE THIS ALSO WHY WHEN YOU WALK INTO A ROOM YOU OFTEN NOTICE A NOVEL SMELL AS HOPE IT'S A GOOD SMELL AFTER A FEW MINUTES OR SO YOU DON'T NOTICE THE SMELL ANY MORE BECAUSE YOUR FACTORY SYSTEM ADAPTED THAT AWAY SO A LOT OF THAT ADAPTATION IS PREVENTED BY THOSE LITTLE MICRO SICODS AND THE MACKROSACOTS THE BIGGER SOCODS ARE REALLY FOR  MOVING YOUR EYES AROUND TO LOOK FOR THINGS IN VISUAL SPACE SMOOTH PURSUIT IS A VERY PARTICULAR KIND OF VISUAL BEHAVIOR THAT YOU CAN DO IN T HE SMOOTH PURSUIT TASK AND ZEOURL COST COSTILELILE BIT OF TIME I SUPPOSE TO DO THIS ON YOU TO AND MOST ANY OF THEM WILL DO WE CAN PROVIDE A LINK IN THE SHOWN OF CAPTIONS OF ONE THAT WE LIKE OR SEVERAL THAT WE LIKE BY BY DOING THAT SMOOTH PURSUIT TASK FOR A BIT EACH DAY MAY BE ST A MINUTE OR TWO YOU'RE MAINTAINING YOUR ABILITY THROUGH THE MUSCULATURE OF THE EYE TO DO SMOOTH PURSUIT AND OF COURSE YOU DO SMOOTH PURSUIT WHEN YOU MOVE ABOUT YOUR DAY BUT FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE SHING TO OFFSET OR REVERSE VISION LOST DOING SOME ADDITIONAL DELIBERATE SMOOTH PURSUIT EXERCISES CAN BE USEFUL THE OTHER VISUAL EXERCISE THAT CAN BE VERY USEFUL AS SO SO CALLED NEAR FAR EXERCISE SO THIS IS A BEST ACCOMPLISHED I THINK BY YOU O HOLDING OUT A A PEN OR PENCIL IN FRONT OF U YOUR EYES IN FRONT OF YOUR HEAD AND FOCUSSING VERY INTENSELY THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED A VIRGENCE I MOVEMENT WORE WE BRING BOTH EYES TO THE TIP OF THE PEN AND THEN MOVING THAT PEN CLOSER AND CLOSER AND CLOSER TO YOUR EYES WHERE YOU GET CLOSE ENOUGH THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO DELIBERATELY BRING YOUR EYES I'M FOR THOSE YEU LISTENING THIS IS WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S BLURRYING YOU CAN NO LONGER HOLD IT IN SHARP CRISP RELIEF YOU CAN'T SEE IT SHARPLY THAT IS ATHEN YOU MOVE IT OUT A LOTE A DISTANCE AND CAN'T PLAY RIGHT AROUND THAT THRESHOLD WHERE IT'S HARD TO KEEP IT IN FOCUS NOW AND THEN MOVE IT BACK OUT AGAIN AND THEN IN DOING THAT FOR EVEN A MINUTE OR TWO YOU'LL FIND IS A BIT OF A STRAIN ON YOUR EYES BUT YOU CAN ACTUALLY BUILD UP THE MUSCULATURE AND THE NUROW MUSCULAR CONNECTIONS THAT ALLOW YOU TO DO THAT MORE EFFICIENTLY AND THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF VISION SPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE DILIGENT ABOUT DOING THOSE EXERCISES NOT ASURELY EVERY DAY BLET'S A THREE DAYS A WEEK OR SO THENK KING BE VERY FASTI ACTUALL FIND THEM KIND OF FUN FOR REASONS THAT ESCAPE ME ENTIRELY A NOW HOW CLOSE YOU CAN BRING THAT OBJECT AND STILL MAINTAIN IT IN SHARP FOCUS WELL VARY FROM PERSON AF PERSON A BASED ON A NUMBER OF THINGS FIRST VALL HOW HEALTHY AND WELL PERFORMING THEIR NURAL RETINA IS WHETHER NOT THEY HAVE MY OPIA OR HYPEROPIA HER SIDENESS ET CETERA WHETHER OR NOT U FOR INSTANCE A YOU'RE LIKE ME AND YOU HAVE A FAIRLY CLOSE INTERPUPILE EVERY DISTANCE OR WHETHER NOT YOUR MORE WALL EYED AN YOU HAVE YOUR EYES SET FURTHER APART ALL THOSE THINGS WILL WILL DICTATE THE EXACT PERFORMANCE OF OF THAT TASK BUT NONE THE LESS IT'S A VERY USEFUL TASK TO DO WHEN TRYING TO MAINTAIN OR IMPROVE VISION NOW OF COURSE THERE ARE A LOT MORE BEHAVIORAL TOOLS THAT ONE COULD USE TO MAINTAINER AND HANCY VISION MERELY TOUCHING ON THE BIGGEST AND WHAT I CONSIDER THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES THAT ARE MOST ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE WITHOUT THE NEED FOR ANY FANCY EQUIPMENT AT ALL AND IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT OTHER BEHAVIORAL TOOLS THAT ONE CAN USE TO MAINTAINER AND HAN'S VISION PLEASE SEE THE EPISODE THAT WE DID ON EYESIHTE YUN SIMPLY GO TO HUBERMAN LABDOK COM PUT INTO THE SEARCH FUNCTION ESIHT OUR VISION AEY'LL TAKE YOUR RIGHT TO T IN FACT EVERYTHING ON THAT WEVSIDT IS KEYWARD INDEX AND WILL TAKE YOU TO THE VARIOUS EPISODES IN TIME STAMPS THAT YOUR INTERESTED IN ACCORDING TO THAT A KEYWARD NOW THE PERSONWO ASK THIS QUESTION WHO BY THE WAY IS PAGE SINGER THANK YOU PAGE SINGER AND THE QUESSION GOT A LOT ABOUT BOATS BECAUSE APPARENTLY THERE'S LOT OF INTEREST IN THIS UNDERSTANDABLY SO ASKED ABOUT NEUTRITION AND SUPPLEMENTS FOR MAINTAINING OR IMPROVING VISION I THAT COULD BE A VERY LANGTHY CONVERSATION BELICIOUST SUMMARISEIN WITH A FEW BRIEF POINTS THAT WE KNOW A STAND BASED ON THE CLINICAL AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT CARROTS ARE GOOD FOR YOUR EYES WELL IT'S NOT CARROTS PER SAY THAT ARE GOOD FOR YOUR EYES IT'S VITEM IN A THAT'S ESSENTIAL FOR THE SO CALLED PHOTOTRANSDUCTION CASCADE THE PHOTOTRAN SUCHIAN CASADE IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE PHOTERESCEPTORS WHICH ARE IN THE BACK OF THE RETNA AT LEAST IF YOU ARE HUMAN THERE IN THE BACK OF THE RETINA TAKE PHOTONS LIGHT ENERGY AND CONVERTED INTO ELECTRICAL SIGNALS THATS THEN CONVEYE TO THE OTHER SELLS AND NURONS WITHIN THE RETNAN THAN PASSED INTO THE BRAIN TO CREATE VISUAL PERCEPTS MOST PEOPLE CAN GET ENOUGH OF THIS FACT SOLUBLE VITEMEN WE CALL VITEMAN EH BY MAKING SURE THAT THEY E AT LEAST SOME DARK GREEN LEAFY VEGETABLES AND THAT THEY DO THAT IN THEIRE CLOSEST TO RAW FORM MAY BE COOKED A LITTLE BIT BUT NOT OVERLY COOKED THER OTHER SOURCES OF VID E MINE OUT THERE YOU CAN LOOK THOSE UP ON LINE JUST FOR YOU KNOW SOURCES OF VIT E MINE MOST PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO GET ENOUGH VIT E MINNE FROM THEIR NUTRITION AND WON'T REQUIRE FROM A SUPPLMENT PROVIDED THAT IT'S NOT PRESENT AT EXCESSIVELY HIGH LEVELS IN A FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMEN OR VIEEM IN MINERAL SUPPLEMENT GETTING IN SOME ADDITIONAL VID E MINE FROM A FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENT OR VIEE MIN MINERAL SUPPLEMENT 'SPROBABLY NOT CAN TO BE IN ISSUE UNLESS YOU REALLY TAKING FAR TOO MUCH OF THAT VID E MINNE AND COULD POTENTILY PROVIDE SOM INSURANCE BUT AGAIN I THINK MOST PEOPLE CAN GET ENOUGH VID E MIN FROM THEIR DIET IF THEYARE TAKING CARE TO EAT THE FOODS THAT CONTAIN VID O MINE GREENLEAF Y VEGETABLES BEING ON THE OTHER FOOD THAT'S KNOWN TO BE HIGHLY ENRICHED INVIT EMINE IS LIVER ONE OF MY LEAST FAVORITE FOODS REGARDLESS OF WHAT ANIMAL THAT LIVER COMES FROM LIVER IS SOMEWHAT OF A POPULAR SLASH CONTROVERSIAL AORGAN MEAT IN THE NUTRITION SPACE FOR REASONS THAT AREN'T INTERESTING AM FORSAKE OF THIS DISCUSSION ANYWAY A I SUPPOSE FOR THOSE WE YOU THAT LIKE LIVER YOU COULD EAT A LA BIT OF LIVER EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE IT IS YOUN RICH IN A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE BENEFICIAL TO HEALTH ALTHOUGH FOR YOU VEGANS OUT THERE SURE YOU'LL WANT TO AVOID LIVER ENTIRELY I AVOID LIVERICAUSE I JUST SIMPLY DON'T LIKE THE WAY IT TASES I'VE MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE I'VE TASTED LIVER THAT WAS APPETIZING TO ME AND IT CAN BE O K BUT ITS JUST NOT A RELEAST BY MY READ IT CAN BE O K BUT IT'S  NOT OF FOOD THAT I ACTIVELY SEEK OUT ORDER OR PREPARE FOR MYSELF ON A REGULAR BASIS AM  SO FORTUNATELY THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES OF VID EMINE AS WELL AND AGAIN I JUST INVITE YOU TO ALL A PUT IN TO A WEB SEARCH YO FOOD SOURCES OF VITE E MINE AND FIGURE  HOW TO GET YOUR DAILY DOSE OF VIT EMINE BY TAKING IN FOODS THAT YOU LIKE FOR YOU AND THEN IN TERMS OF SUPPLEMENTATION OF THINGS THAT CAN ENHANCE VISION THIS IS A NEWER AREA AND FRANKLY IT'S AN AREA WHERE MOST OF THE DATA POINT TO SOME SUPPLEMENTS THAT CAN POTENTIALLY BE BENEFICIAL IN CERTAIN DISEASE CONDITION SO FOR INSTANT IN FAIRLY PROGRESSED AGE RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION ADRELEMACULAR DEGENERATION IS FAIRLY COMMON OR MORE COMMON THAN WE WOULD LIKE WE SHOULD SAY UM AND IT DOES APPEAR THAT SUPPLEMENTING WITH CERTAIN THINGS LIKE LUTINE UM WHICH IS PRESENT IN EGGS OR EGYOKES IN PARTICULAR ESPECIALLY EGYOKES THAT AREN'T OVERLY COOKED OR THAT CAN BE SUPPLEMENTED CAN POTENTIALLY HELP WITH SOME INSTANCES OF AGE RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION BUT THE DATE ON THIS ARE STILL EMERGING I CONSULTED WITH OUR CHAIR OF OPTHEMOLOGY AT STANFORD ABOUT LOUTINE AND SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THEYOU'LL SEE OUT THERE LIKE SEE ASZANTHINE AND ASTAZANTHINES AND YOU KNOW THESE A SANTHINES A COME FROM  CERTAIN FRUITS LIKE BLUEBERRIES AND THEIR PRESENT AND SUPPLEMENTS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT THE CONSENCIS I GOT TALKING TO HIM AND TALKING SOME OTHER OPTHEMOLOGIST ARE THAT IF YOURE REALLY AIMING TO GET A HEALTHY DIET YOU'RE AVOIDING CIGARETTE SMOKING AND BY HEALTHY DIET MEAN GETTING SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OF IDOMANAE AND LOUTINE THROUGH FOOD SOURCES AGAIN YOU CAN LOOK UP WHERE THOSE O FOOD SOURCES ARE EGYOKES JUST BEING ONE OF THEM WELL THEN CHANCES ARE YOURE NOT GOING TO NEED TO SUPPLEMENT WITH LOUTINE OR THE SEEASANTHINES ARE THE ASTASANTHINES HOWEVER I HAVE HEARD ANECDOTAL REPORTS FROM A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT THEY'LL START TAKING A SUPPLEMENT FOR I HEALTH THEIR NUMBER OF THEM OUT THERE WE ARE NOT AS A PODCAST OF FHILIA WITH ANY OF THOSE I HEL SUPPLEMENTS BY THE WAY AND PEOPLE ARE REPORTING ENHANCE DIVISION UM AN I PERCEIVE HEMALS ALL THE TIME THAT SAY YOU NOTAV TAKING THIS INA LUTINE AT TWENTY MILIGRAMS PER DAY AND THERE I SHOULD MENTION THAT THE DOSAGE THAT'S BEEN EXPLORED IN A COUPLE OF STUDIES IS TEN TO TWENTY MILIGRAMS PER DAY AGAIN YOU COULD GET THAT FROM FOODS YOU COULD GO ABOVE THAT IF YOU'RE YOU KNOW ORE A CAVALIER OR YOU COULD UM GO TOWARD THE LOWER AT END OF THAT TEN TO TWENTY MILIGRAMS PER DAY AIF YOU WERE SOMEBODY WHO TRIES TO WHOSE MORE CONSERVATIVE I SHOULD SAY WELL THERE AREN'T PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE A YOU KNOW LOOKING AT LIUTINE THEY THINK IT'S FAIRLY SAFE AND THEIRE TAKING HIHER DOSAGES OF LIEUTINES SO TWENTY THIRTY MELIGRAMS PER DAY THE'E ALSO TAKING SUPPLEMENTS A CONTAINS EAZANTHINES AND ASKEASANTHINES AND ARE REPORTING ANECDOTALLY THAT THEIR VISION IS ENHANCED I DON'T DISPUTE THOSE CLAIMS UM BUT AS OF NOW THERE AREN'T MANY PAPERS I COULD ONLY FIND ABOUT FOUR THREE REALLY SOLID ONES AND THEN A FOURTH THAT POINT TO THE SPECIFIC DISEASE INSTANCEIS WHERE SUPPLEMENTING WITH LIUTINE EASANTHINE OR ASOANTHIN CAN BE BENEFICIAL FOR SLOWING THE PROGRESSION OF THINGS LIKE ADVANCED ONSET AGERALLYMACLER DEGENERATION AND THE DEGREE OF OFFSET FOR THAT MACLE DE GENERATION WAS SLIGHT IT WASN'T ENORMOUS BUT IT WAS RO ROBUSTAN NOFF THAT IT WAS IT WARRENTED REPORTING IN THE PAPER OR THINGS LIKE LEBERS WHICH IS A PARTICULAR EYE DISEASE OF PACKS A WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF SYSTEMS IN THE EYE SO BASILY WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS WHEN IT COMES TO SUPPLEMENTS TO SUPPORT I HEALTH MAKE SURE YOU'R GETTING ENOUGH VITEM IN E FROM YOUR DIED IF YOU'RE NOT CONSIDER SUPPLEMENTATION OR CONCEDER CHANGING YOUR DIET SOMEWHAT TO MAKE SURE YOU CAN GET THAT LIEUTINE INVITEEM INEH AND IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN IT N IT'S WITHIN YOUR BUDGET I DON'T KNOW OF ANY UM EVIDENCE THAT SUPPLEMENTING WITH ADDITIONAL LIUTIE EAZANTHINE AND ASOSANTHINE CAN BE DANGEROUS AT ALLSO FOR THOSE WHEITHER REALLY INTERESTED IN A MAINTAINING YOUR IMPROVING YOUR VISION THAT MIGHT BE AN AIREA THAT YOU WANT TO EXPLORE I PERSONALLY AM NOT TAKING LIUTINES ZEASANTHINE OR ASOASANTHINE LEAST NOT AT THIS TIME I DOO TAKE A FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENT A WHICH IS MY SOURCE OF VIDEMANE IN ADDITION TO MY A FOOD SOURCES UM BUT I DON'T SUFFER FROM VISION LOST A DO WHERE READERS AT NIGHT AND I HAVE FOR A LONG TIME I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A A MUSCULAR WEAKNESS IN ONE OF MY EYES I'M THAT ORIGINATE IN CHILDHOOD I'M SO OCCASIONALL IF I GET VERY FATIGUE ONE OF MY EYES WILL DEVIATE A LITLE BIT A LITTLE BIT OF AM ALMOST TRBUSIMESS I ESPECIAY IF I'VE BEEN AWAKE FOR VERY LONG PERIODS OF TIME ITTENDS TO RECOVER ONCE I  GOOD NIGHTS SLEEP SUME OF YOU THAT OF EXPERIENCES WERE YOU HAVE ONE EYE THAT MIGHT JUST DRIFT A LITTLE I COULDO THIS FOR THE CAMERA IF YOU WANT OCETSIS W EARED I USE TO DO THIS IM TO MY SISTER ACROSS THE TABLE WHEN WE WERE AT A FRIEND'S HOUSES FOR DINERS I CAN ACTUALLY MOVE ONE OF MY EYES IN LIKE THIS WHICH ACTUALLY JUST REFLECTS THAT THERE'S A A MUSCLE EXTROCULAR MUSCLE A CLOSER IN MY NOSE IT'S RATHER WEAK WHICH ALLOWS ME TO DO THAT I CAN'T DO IT SO WELL WITH THE OPPOSITE EYE IM IMA NOW ANY TO BLINK TO CAT CLEAR MY VISION BUT THE POINT IS THAT IF YOUR SOMEBODYWHO HAS A SLIGHTLY DEVIATING EYE SLIGHTLY OFTEN IF YOU GO TO THE OPTHEMOL JUST OR OPTOMATRIST THY'REGIN TO GIVE YOU A PRISM LENS WHICH IS GOING TO REDIRECT THE IMAGE ON TO THAT SLIGHTLY DEFLECTED EYEBALL ONE THING YOU'LL REALLY WANT TO DISCUSS WITH THAT OPTHEMOLOGIST OR OPTOMATRIST IS WHETHER NOT THEIRE RE EXERCISES THAT YOU COULD DO TO OVERCOME THAT ISSUE WITHOUT THE NEED FOR A PRISM BECAUSE WHAT I SAW IN WHAT MANY OTHER PEOPLE SEE WHEN THEY PUT ON A PRISM LENSIS THAT INDEED IT CAN I'M LINE UP THEIR VISION WHER THE VISUAL PERCEPTION BETTER BUT INDEED IT CAN LEAD TO PROGRESS OF WEAKENING OF THE MUSCLE FURTHER AND FURTHER SO THAN THAT EYEBALLS ARE O DEVIATE FURTHER AND FURTHER AND THAT RAISES A LARGER QUESTION WHICH IS SHOULD WE WEAR CORRECTIVE LENSES IN FACT IF YOU GO ON LINE YOU'LL FIND OR HEAR ABOUT THESE EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE THAT STOPPED WEARING THEIR CORRECTIVE LENSES THEIR GLASSES OR CONTACTS IN ORDER TO BRING THEIR VISION BACKER IN PROVE THEIR VISION ON THEIR OWN NOW IF YOUR VISION IS QUITE IMPAIRED YOU'RE GOING TO NEED CORRECTIVE LENSES OR CONTACTS HOWEVER THERE ARE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO FIND THAT IF THEIRE VISION IS SOMEWHAT IMPAIRED THAT FORCING THEMSELVES TO VIEW THINGS AT A DISTANCE TO DO SMITH PURSUIT TO DO NEAR FAR AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIRE GETTING ADEQUATE NUTRITION AND THINGS OF THAT SORT CAN ALL SOME TO HELP OFFSET SOME OF THE VISUAL IMPAIRMENT THAT WOULD OCCUR IF THEY WERE TO JUST POP GLASSES ON THEIR FACE AND IM AND RELY ON THE CORRECTIVE LENSES IN ORDER TO FOCUS THAT THE LIGHT ON TO THE CORRECT I AREA WITHIN THE EYE ON TO THE NURL RETINA SO 'M NOT TELLING PEOPLE TO THROW OFF OR OR GET RID OF THEIR CORRECTIVE LENSES AND CONTACTS BUT YOU CAN BE OVERLY RELIANT ON THESE THINGS LIKE A CRUTCH IN A WAY THAT PERHAPS YOU WANT TO DO A LA BIT OF WORK TO TRY AND OVERCOME AND THEM M BE WORK WITH A WEAKER PRESCRIPTION AND CERTAINLY IN THE CASE OF A PRISM LENSES I WHAT I MENTION BEFORE AS IT IS A REAL CONSIDERATION IT'S ONE I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH SO AS A LAST BUT I THINK VERY IMPORTANT AND EXCITING FEATURE OF VISUAL IMPROVEMENT IS RED LIGHT I TALKED A LOWL BIT ABOUT THIS ON THE EPISODE O THE HURIN LA POTCAS ALL BOUT LIGHT AND HEALTH THERE' SOME REALLY SPECTACULAR I THINK I CONSIDERATE SPECTACULAR MANY OTHER PEOPLE CONSIDERATE SPECTACULATE RESEARCH OUT OF UNIVERSILY COLLEGE LONDON AND THE WORK I'M REFERRING TO IS GLEN JEFFREYS WORK I'VE NO GLEN FOR A LONG TIME THESE ARE ANIMAL STUDIES IN NOW TWO HUMAN STUDIES EXPLORING HOW EXPOSURE TO RED LIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY CAN OFFSET SOME OF THE VISION LOSTS RELATED TO AGRELAY EMACULARE DEGENERATION OR SIMPLY AGE RELATED VISUAL DECLINE THERE'S A WHOLE MECHANISM HERE THAT'S DISCUSSED IN THAT EPISODE BUT IT HASKD TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT RED LIGHT AND NEAR IN FOR RED LIGHT TOGETHER OR MAYBE EVEN SEPARATELY WHEN VIEWED FOR EVEN JUST A MINUTE TO THREE MINUTES ONCE OR MAY BE TWO OR THREE TIMES PER WEEK MAXIMUM CAN ACTUALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER O WHAT ARE CALLED REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES AND THE PHOTORECEPTERS THOT CONVERT PHOTONS INTO ELECTRICAL SIGNALS THE REST OF THE VISUAL SYSTEM CAN UNDERSTANDSO THAT'S A MOUTHFUL BASITLY WHAT THEY FOUND WAS FOR PEOPLE FORTY YEARS OR OLDER IF THEY VIEWED THIS RED LIGHT THE DISTANCE OF A BOUT A FOOT AND A HALF THOUGH I WOULDN'T GET TWO SPECIFIC WITH US FOR A FEW MINUTES EACH WEEK TOTAL THEY WERE ABLE TO OFFSET SOME OF THE VISION LOST WITHIN A PARTICULAR DOMAIN OF VISION AND I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO INTO THE DETAILS HERE BUT BECAUSE I DO THAT IN THE LIGHT FOR HEALTH EPISODE BUT YOU HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PHOTORECEPTORS CONES AND RODS YOU HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONE PHOTORECEPTORS THAT RESPOND TO DIFFERENT WAVE LANGS OF LIGHT SHORT MEDIUM AND LONG WAVELINGS OLIGHT SO CALLED BLUE GREEN AND RED CONES ARE SOMETIMES CALLED WHEN THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE FORTY YEARS ARE OLDER VIEWED RED LIGHT ON A CONSISTENT BASIS EARLY IN THE DAY AND IT DID HAVE TO BE EARLY IN THE DAY THERE WAS A REAL CIRCATIAN EFFECT THERE THERE WAS A OFFSET OF SOME OF THE VISION LOST THAT WULD NORMALLY OCCUR IN A PARTICULAR WAVE LENGTH OF LIGHT RANGE THAT RESULTED IN BETTER VISUAL CUITY OVER ALL SO IF YOU'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR VISION OR INTO RED LIGHT THERAPIECE ET CETERA HERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT RED LIGHT DEVICES OUT THERE AT SOME FUTURE POINT THE HUBRAN LABPODCASTS MAY PARTNER WITH ONE OF THESE RED LIGHT COMPANIES A SERE NOMNOCKIN A MENSION ANY OF THEM PRETULA THEIR PROMINENT ON LINE WHAT YOURE LOOKING FOR IS A RED LIGHT UNIT THAT PROVIDES RED LIGHT AND MAY BE FAR AN NEAR INFOR RED SCUSE ME LIGHT AS WELL SO SOMETHING IN THE YOU SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY ISH ANANIMATER RANGE SO REALLY YON SCAN LOOK RED OR ALMOST INVISIBLE TO YOU IF IT'S REALLY YOU KNOW REALLY FAR INTO THE INFOR RED AND YOU'LL WANT TO VIEW THAT AT A DISTANCE ABOUT A FOOT AND A HALF TO TWO FEET AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SO BRIGHT THAT IT'S PAINFUL TO LOOK OUT OF KICKAS YOU DON'T WANT A DAMAGE YOUR ISES BUT THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT THEY USED IN THESE STUDIES FROM THE JEOFFREY LABENE SHOWED A'M SOME PRETTY IMPRESSIVE OFFSET OF SOME OF THE ASPECTS OF VISION LOST IN TESE PEOPLE FORTY AND OLDER SO THAT'S AN AREA THAT I YOU MAY WANT TO EXPLORE AS WELL ESPECIALLY FOR FOLKS FORTY INNER OLDER AND AGAIN THIS RED LIGHT EXPOSURE HAD TO BE DONE EARLY IN THE DAY SO HOPEFULLY THAT COLLECTION OF BEHAVIORAL TOOLS NEAR FAR SMOOTH PURSUED SOME OF THE DISCUSSION ABOUT LUTINE NUTRICIAN VITMANAE SUPPLEMENTATIONS EASANTHENES ASKED A ZANTHENES ON GETTING TWO HOURS OF LIGHT EXPOSURE OUTSIDE SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE GET OUTSIDE TO DO SOME OF YOUR WORK AND PERHAPS EVEN DELIBERATE RED LIGHT EXPOSURE FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE CAN BE USED TO OFFSET YOUR CONCERNS AND YOURE ACTUAL POTENTIAL VISION LOSTS MAYBE VEN IMPROVE YOUR VISION REGARDLESS OF WHAT AGE YOU ARE EVERYTHING I DESCRIBED IS SUPPORTED FROM THE PURE OF YOU LITERATURE AND AGAIN IF YOU WANT TO GET THE DEEP DIVE ON MECHANISM AND FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT DOZAGES PLEASE

WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LACON CAS TSCUS SCIENCE  SCIENCE PASE TOOL FORLI  I M INDRUPUBERMEN AND ON A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDISON MY GUEST TODAY IS DOCTOR NADILY CRAWFORD DOCTOR NADLEY CRAWFORD IS A MEDICAL DOCTOR SPECIALIZING AND OBSTETRICS AND GYNACOLOGY REPRODUCTIVE AND CHRONOLOGY AND IN FERTILITY SHE ALSO HOLDS A DEGREE IN NUTRITIAN SCIENCE DOCTOR CRAWFORD RUNS A CLINICAL PRACTICE SEEN PATIENTS DAILY AS WELL AS BEING ACTIVELY INVOLVED INPUBLIC EDUCATION BOTH THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND THROUGH HER POWPULAR PODCAST ENTITLED AS A WOMAN TO DAY DOCTOR CRAWFORD TEACHES US ABOUT ALL ASPECTS OF FEMALE HORMONES AND HORMONE HEALTH AND FERTILITY BEGINNING AS FAR BACK AS IN UTERO WHEN WE WERE STILL IN OUR MOTHER'S WOMB AND EXTENDING AS FAR FORWARD AS MENOPAUSE WE DISCUSS TOPIC SUCH AS THE TIMING OF PUBERTY AND WHAT THE TIMING OF PUBERTY IN GIRLS MEANS FOR THEIR FERTILITY AND WE DISCUSS BIRTH CONTROL BOTH HARMONAL AND NONHORMONAL FORMS OF BIRTH CONTROL AND HOW BIRTH CONTROL MAYOR MAY NOT RELATE TO LONG TERM FERTILITY AND DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF FEMALE HEALTH WE ASO TALK EXTENSIVELY ABOUT MEASURING FERTILITY THAT IS A COUNT WE ALSO TALK ABOUT EGRETREVAL AH A FREEZING ONE'S EGGS AS WELL AS INVETRO FERTILIZATION AND WE ALSO TAKE A DEEP DIVE INTO THE POPULAR AND IMPORTANT TOPICS OF NUTRICIAN AND SUPPLEMENTATION AS THEY RELATE TO FERTILITY AS THEY RELATE TO PREGNANCY BUT ALSO HOW THEY RELATE TO FEMALE HORMONE HEALTH GENERALLY INDEED DOCTOR CRAWFORD PROVIDES US WITH A MASTER CLASS ON FEMALE HORMONES AND FERTILITY ONE THAT I KNOW THAT ALL WOMEN OUGHT TO BENEFIT FROM AND THAT MEN WOULD BENEFIT FROM LISTENING TO AS WELL BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT

AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR NATLY CRAWFORD DOCTOR CROFFORD WELCOME THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME M HONOR TO BE HERE WHILE I'VE BEEN THING ATTENTION TO YOUR CONTENT FOR A LONG TIME AND I FIND IT TO BE INCREDIBLY CLEAR INFORMATIVE AND FOR MANY PEOPLE ACTIONABLE SO TO DAY I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT BOTH FERTILITY AND OF COURSE HORMONES BUT AS WE BOTH KNOW FERTILITY IS NOT LIMINTED TO A DISCUSSION ABOUT HORMONES NATUALLY LATES THE THINGS LIKE BEHAVIORS SEX BEHAVIORS AND OTHER BEHAVIORS NUTRITIAN SUPPLIMENTATIONS AN WILL GET INTO ALL OF IT BUT IF WE COULD JUST BACK UP DEVELOPMENTALLY AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT FEMALE PUBERTY BECAUSE I THINK PRETY MUCH EVERYTHING WILL TALK ABOUT TODAY IS RELATED TO WHAT HAPPENS PUBERTY FORWARD MOSTLY IN FEMALES BUT WE WILL ALSO DISCUSS MALE FERTILITY IN HORMONES A BIT AND THE QUESTION I HAVE IS IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT A WOMAN'S TIMING OR LET'S JUST SAY PATTERNS OF PUBERTY WRITE HOW FREQUENTLY IMENSTRATE EARLY ON WITH THE TIMING OF MENSTRUATION IS O INTERMS OF THEIR AGE ET CETERA THET PROVIDES HINTS OR MAYBE VEN FACTS WERE DIRECTIVES ABOUT HER FUTURE FUTILITY OR HOW LONG HER FETILITY MIGHT LAST THIS IS A GREAT QUESTION AND I THINK DEFINING SOME TERMINOLOGY BEFORE WE BEGIN AS HELPFUL SO IF WE GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO WIN YOU'RE EPIDUS INSIDE DERMAN SO WHEN THERE'S A FEMALE FEEDUS IN SIERMAM YOU'VE THE MOST EGGS YOURE EVER GOING TO HAVE AT ABOUT TWENTY WEEKS JESTATION IF ABOUT SIX TO SEVEN MILLION EGGS BY THE TIME YOU'RE BORN YOU'VE ALREADY LOST MORE THAN HALF OF THOSE AND YOU CONTINUALLY LOSE EGGS ALL THE TIME SO THE ANALOGY THAT I ALWAYS USE AND YOU DO TOO IS IMAGINING THAT THERE'S A VAULT INSIDE THE OVERY WHERE ALL YOUR EGGS ARE KEPT AND EVERY SINGLE MONTH SINCE THE MOMENT YOU HAVE AN OVERY YOU LOSE A GROUP OF THESE EGGS AND WHEN THERE'S MORE INSIDE YOU'RE LOSING MORE SO YOU'R LOSING ALL OF THESE EGGS THROUGHOUT EARLY FEETAL DEVELOPMENT AND THEN UP UNTIL THE TIME PERIOD EVEN OF PUBERTY WHEN YOU REACH PUBERTY YOU HAVE A LESSENING OF THE NUMBER OF EGGS IND YOUR OVERY TO THE POINT WHERE IT CAN START TO RESPOND TO THE SIGNALS FROM THE BRAIM SO WE THINK ABOUT PUBERTY ARNS THAT IN FEMALES FIRST WE HAVE RELASED THELARCHY WHICH IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF BREASTS SO THAT HAPPENS ABOUT TWO YEARS ON AVERAGE BEFORE YOU HAVE MINARCHY WHICH IS YOUR PERIODS STARTING SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THE BRAIN AS WE KNOW FROM THE HYPOTHLYMAS SINCE HAT GE AN OUR AGE AND THA WE HAVE EF ESAGH COMING OU WHICH REALLY STARTS TO STIMULATE THOSE FOLICALS SO FAS A TROPHOLICAL STIMULATING HORMONE WELL NAMED HORMONE FER THE FEMALE OF COURSE MEN HAVE IT TOO AND IT'S LESS WELL NAMED FOR THEM BUT IT STARTS TO GET THOSE FOLICOLS WHICH HOUSE THE EGGS TO GROW AND MAKE ESTRAGEN WOMEN HAVE ABOUT TWO YEARS OF ESTROGEN EXPOSURE ALONE SO UNOPPOSED ESTROGEN WITH NO PROGESTRONE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT YET ODULATING AND THAT'S WHEN YOU START TO SEE BREAST BUDDYING AND YOU START TO SEE THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME OF THOSE SECONDARY SEX CHARACTERISTICS BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A PERIOD WHAT AR SOME OF THE OTHER SECONDARY SEX CHARACTERISTIX THAT PRECEDE MANARCHY AMS HE SAID A BREASTBUD DEVELOPMENT IN THE BREAST DEVELOPMENT A ON AVERAGE ABOUT TWO YEARS AHOR YEARS AND ARE YOU HAVE SEXUAL HAIR DEVELOPMENTS ARE ACTULLY ADERNARCHY IS ONE OF THE FIRST USUALLY COMES RIGHT BEFORE AT THE SAME TIME WITH BRASSBUD SO TWO TO THREE YEARS BEFORE YOU'LL SEE YOUR PERIOD AND THEN GENERAL HAIR UNDER ARM HAIR EXACTLY IT DONOT HAIR USUALY FAIREST TAND THE I AR M HAIR AM AND A WELD GETTING RIGHT DOWN NTO THE WEEDS HERE WHICH IS GOOD AM AGOLL OF THIS PODCASTIS TO NORMALIZE ALL ASPECTS OF HEALTH INCLUDING SEXUAL HEALTH AND AND A REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AM IS THAT COMMENCR ALSO WITH AM THE DEVELOPMENT OF BODY ODOUR NOIS AS A YOUNG BOY WHO VENTUALLY ITPEBERTIN BECAME A YOUNG MAN IN NOW I SUPPOSE I'M AN MIDDLE AGE A FORTY EIGHT AM I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE THE LOCKER ROOM SMELLED A LOT DIFFERENT A TE BEFORE AND AFTER MIDDLE SCHOOL RIGHT Y LIGHT LIKE THA IN OTHER WORDS A BOYS START TO SMELL STINKY A RIGHT DO YES AND THAT'S USUALLY ROUND THAT SAME TIME OF SEXUAL HAIR DEVELOPMENT AS WHEN YOU SARD TO HAVE THOSE GLANDS AROUND THE HAIR MAKING SOME OF THOSE ODOURS THAT SARE TO PRODUCE STINK DO THEY REFLECT HORMONS THEMSELVES NOT THIS LIKE THI SMELL THE ACTUAL SMELL DOESN'T ACTUALLY REFLECT LEVELS OF CORNMONES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT IS JUST THAT YOU ARE BODY YOUR GON OUTS WHETHER IT IS TESTES ARE OVERIES ARE NOW STARTING TO RESPOND TO THOSE BRAIN SIGNALS THE BRAIN IS TURNED ON THEIR STARDYING TO RESPOND IN YOUR BODY STARTING TO MATURE AND AWAY TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE IT CAN SUPPORT REPRODUCTION THE REASON I ASK THAT QUESTION IS NOT TO HEAT PEOPLE THINKING ABOUT A STINKY SMELLS BUT  AND BY THE WAY SOME PEOPLE LOVE THE MUSTY SMELL O ON THEIR OWN ABOUT A A ARMS YATS AR THERS YOU KNOW  E REFERRING TO ADULTS AM BY THE WAY AM BUT THE REASON I ASK IS THAT THERES A WEALTH OF DATA IN ANIMAL MODELS INCLUDING NON HUMAN PRIMATES SUGGESTING THAT UM EXPOSURE TO THE ODORS OF OTHERS CAN EITHER UM STIMULATE OR ACCELERATE PUBERTY U ISE ANY EVIDENCE FOR THAT INHUMENTS SO THERE'S MILD EVIDENCE AND IT'S MERCHY BECAUSE WE ALSO KNOW THAT ANYTHING THAT COULD BE AN INTERCRENDISRUPTOR WHICH A LOT OF SENTE OR FRAGRANCES ARE ALSO CAN EXCELERA THE ONSET OF PUBERTY BY DESTRUPTING PART OF THIS SYSTEM AND SO WE KNOW THAT TOXENS AND N OF SENSE AND A LOT OF THE WORLD THAT WE'RE EXPOSED TO IS PART OF THE REASON WHY WE'RE SEEING PUBERTY HAPPING AT SUCH A YOUNGER AGE NOW IN FEMALES SPECIFICALLY BUT IN BOTH BUT IN FEMALES THAN WE HAVE BEFORE WE HAVE YOUNG GIRLS SEEING THEIR ONSET OF MINARCHY AT THEIR PERIOD AT A MUCH YOUNGER AE HOW MUCH YOUNGER I'VE SEEN THE VARIOUS GRASTS FOR DIFFERENT COUNTRIES BUT CAN WE SAY THAT YOU KNOW TEN YEARS AGO ON AVERAGE UM GIRL SIN THE UNITED STATES IN NORTHERN EUROPE WERE TIN MENARKYET ABOUT WHAT TWELVE TO THIRTEEN YEARS OL AND SO WE KNOW STARTBLLS ESE MENARCHY FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS SO HAVING YOUR PERIOD YOU KNOW TEN TO TWENTY YEARS AGO YOU WILL SEE MOST SDATA WOULD SAY OH THIRTEEN TO FIFTEEN WOULD HAVE BEEN KIND OF THE AVERAGE AGE AND NOW WER REALLY SEEN AT SHIFT TO BE STARTING AT TEN TO ELEVEN AND COMPLETING BY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN SO MOST GIRLS ARE DEFINITELY GOING THROUGH THE PUBERTY CHANGE EARLIER AND THE OTHER THING TO KNOTE IS THAT MOST GIRLS GET THEIR FINAL HEIGHTGROWTH RIGHT BEFORE THEY START THEIR PERIOD TO SO NOT ONLY ARE WE SEEN A CHANGE AND THIS GETTING STARTING EARLIER WHET WE'RE ALSO SEENG AS PROBABLY SOME REDUCTION AT HEIGHT FROM HAVING GONE THROUGH PUBERTY AT AN EARLIER PROCESS BECAUSE ONCE YOU START ACTUALLY MENSTRATING ONCE THE OVERIES HAVE REALLY STARTED TO LEARN HOW TO RESPOND TO THAT EFFESSAGE AND GROW THE PHOLICAL AND IT GETS TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN START OBULATING SABOUT TWO YEARS LATER THEN THAT OBULATORY PERIOD THOSE HIGH LEVELS OF EST ERGEN ARE GOING TO GO AND THEY'RE GOING TO CLOSE THOSE GROWTH PLATES SO YOUVEREALLY STARTED TO LIMIT YOUR FINAL ADULT HEIGHT AS WELL WHEN YOU GO THROUGH PUBERTY EARLIER AND NOT SUFTNLINY SOMETHING THAT'S A HUGE CONCERN FOR PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY AR VERY YOUNG PUBERTY RIGHT AND WE CAN USE BLOCKERS WHEN THERE ARE CHILDREN WHO START TO EXHIBIT SIGNS OF PUBERTY AND ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS PEOPLE DO THAT IS TO TRY TO GET THEM TU A GREATER ADULT HEIGHT IF THERRE REALLY STARTING TO GO THROUGH PUBERTY AT A VERY YOUNG AGE IS TAT ALSO TRUE FOR MAILS THAT IS HAPPENING EARLY I REALLYIOR PUBERTY MEANS THAT YOUR GROWTH SPURT A A TERMS OF HEIGHT IS GOING TO BE A TRUNCATED NOT THE SAME AND YOU PUBLY MOST MEN WILL SAY OH BUT I HAD MY GROWHSPER YOU KNOW KIND OF AFTER I STARTED HAVING SOME OF THE PUBERTY CHANGE THAT HAPPENED BUT BECAUSE IT IS THIS ESTRA GENRELATED PROCESS AND WOMEN THAT WE SEE THAT GROWSPER REALLY YOUR FINAL HEIGHT AS WITHIN THAT YEAR OF WHEN YOUR PERIOD STARTS INTERESTING YOAT THIS A DISCUSSION IS CERAINLY NOT ABOUT ME BUT I WAS ONE OF THESE BUT I THOUGHT WAS COAVE AN ADD DUCK A HIT PUBETY BOUT THIRTEEN FOURTEEN UM MIS TER SAY I KNEW I DID UM BUT I DIDN'T SHAVE UNTIL I WAS AFTER COLLEGE MY GROW SPURT BETWEEN FRESHMENT AND SOPHOMOR YU I GREW AYWAT I TIS LIKE YOU GROW FULL FOOT BUT I WAS THE SAME WEIGHT SOLI REAL TALLERAL SKINNY AR PRETALL THAT YOU KNOW REAL SKINNY AND THEN IT SEEMS LIKE UM YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE MY LIFE WOULD ARGUE THAT PUBERTY STILL OCCURRING FOR ME IT AS AGAIN VERY LONG IN PROCHRACTON WHICH LEADS ME TO A I A UM A VERY SPECIFIC QUESTION A IF PUBERTY ARRIVES LESS AGAIN DEFIND IS MENARCHY AM FORSAKE OF OUR DISCUSSION RIGHT KNOW IF PUBERTY ARRIVES REALLY IN A GIRL DOES THAT MEAN THAT HER FERTILITY WILL SHUT DOWN EARLIER AS RANESTON IT DOES NOT SO THE AGE OF WHICH YOU START THE ONSET OF YOUR PERIOD DOES NOT IMPACT HOW LONG YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A REPRODUCTIVE LIFE SPAN AND NOT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE EGGS INSIDE THAT BAULT YOU'RE LOSING THEM EVERY MONTH NO MATTER WH SO YOU LOST THEM ALL THOSE YEARS BEFORE YOUR PERIOD STARTED NO MATTER IF YOUR PERIOD CAME AT TEN OR AT FIFTEEN IT'S JUST ABOUT WINDID THEY START ALLOWING YOUR BODY TO OVULATE DETERMINED BY BEING ABLE TO CARRY A BABY O YOUR BODY NO THING YOU CAN BE PRIGNAT I THINK THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT BECAUSE IT PUTS TOGETHER WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER ABOUT THE LOSS OF EGGS EVEN IN  AS A FEEDUS A I THINK MOST PEOPLE SORT OF ASSUME THAT THE REDUCTION IN EGG COUNT IS DUE TO OVULATION AND THE FACT THAT YOU ONE EGG OVULATES TYPICALLY BUT THAT OTHER EGGS ARE DEPLOYED IN THAT OPULATORY CYCLE ONE THAN THOSE THOSE BASELY ARE TAKEN OUT OF THE VAULT AND OUT OF THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FERTILIZATION BUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THE EGGS ARE CONSTANTLY BE CALLED FROM THE VAULT STARTING FROM EARLY O EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT AND THAT OVULATION IS A A DISTINCT STEP IN SOME SENSE UNRELATED TO THE MOSS OV EGTAT'S THE LOSS OF EGGS I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR OUR DISCUSSION LATER ABOUT POTENTIAL EGG HARVEST YEF BECAUSE I THINK SOME PEOPLE HAVE IT IN MIND THE RODAMITS CONCEPTION THAT YOURE LOSING EGGS FROM YOUR FAULT AND THAT'S NOT THE CASE YOU ARE JUST ACCESSING THE ONES OUTSIDE I SHALL YOU'RE NOT A SO WE CAN JUST ANSWER THIS NOW PERHAPS IT SEEMS IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THAT IF ONE WERE TO HARVEST EGGS FOR IVIF OR FOR EMBRYOGENESIS AN ADDITION AR SETTEM ASIDE LATER OR FREES THEM FOR LATER UM IF THEY WONT TO USE THEM EGGS OR OR FOR LIZED EMBRYOS THAT ONE IS NOT REDUCING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF EGGS ANY MORE THAN THEY WOULD HAD THEY JUST LET THEIR THEIR CYCLES PRECEED NATURAL EXACTLY ALL THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT POINT I THINK THA I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE THE OPPOSITE THEY PROBABLY THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT PATIENTS FEAR WHEN THEY COMTALK TO ME ABOUT EG FREEZING OR GOING TO IVIF IS I DON'T WANT TO HARM MY FUTURE FERTILITY I DON'T WANT TO CAUSE MYSELF TO VINOTA EGGS EARLIER GOING TO MENAPAS EARLIER AND IT'S EXPLAINING THIS PROCESS TO THEM THET YOUR OVERIES ARE ON A PATHWAY THAT YOU CAN'T CHANGE THOSE EGGS ARE COMING OUT OF THE VAULT REGARDLESS OF IF YOURE ON BIRTH CONTROL PILLS YOURE PRAGNANT WE DO IVY OUGH WHATI WE'RE MODIFYING IS ONE'S NOT GONE TO OBULATE AND HAVE THE REST OF THEM DIE WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO GIVE YOU MEDICATION TO GET THEM ALL TO GROW SO WE CAN TAKE ALL OF THE WINES THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED FROM THE VAULT THAT MONTH AND GIVE THEM A CHANCE FOR LATER AND THE NEXT MONTH YOU'LL HAVE ANOTHER GROUP COME OUT SO IV F IS NOT ABOUT STIMULATING HIPER RELEASE OR EXCESSIVE RELEASE OV EGGS IT'S ABOUT STIMULATING THE GROWTH OF THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASE SO THAT THEY CAN BE FROZEN E STAGE EITHER FERLATER FERILIZATION OR FERLIE IN ADDITION THAN FROZEN IS EMBRIOS TRIGHT EXACTLY AND WE JUST USE THE HORMONESTHAT YOUR BODY NORMALLY MAKES IN A DIFFERENT WAY THE MEDICATIONS WE USE ARE A FASAGE A NELL AGE TO GET THE EGG TO GROW SO PEOPLE WILL SAY ITO WON TO TAKE ALL THESE WEIRD HORMONES OR STRANGE MEDICATIONS BUT WE'RE JUST MANIPULATING THAT NORMAL PROCESS THAT HAPPENS AND THE NATURAL MINSTRUAL CYCLE IN ORDER TO SAY HAY THIS MONTH LET'S GET ALL THESE EGGS TO GROW LET'S TRY TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY A FINDING WHICH EGGS ARE GOING TO BE NORMAL OR NOT AND HELP YOU ALONG THIS PROCESS I THINK A GOOD NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE NOW GOING TO AAD TO THE IV F CLINIC I THINK AGAIN I REALLY WANT A HIGH LIKE THIS II THINK MOST PEOPLE THAT I'VE SPOKEN TO ASSUME THAT THE PROCESS OF HARVESTING EGGS FOR FREEZING FOR FERTALIZATION THEN OR LATOR IS GOING TO DIMINISH THEIR FERTILITY BECAUSE THEYIRE BASILY PULLING MORE OUT OF THE SAVINGS ACCOUNT SO TO SPEAK RIGHT OC SO WEE MAKING THEY WITHDRAW NO MATTER WHAT GIT WELL ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT POINT FOR RE PEOPLE TO KNOWIN AND PROPAGATE A GETTING BACK TO PUBERTY A LILL BIT LATER ON I WANTED TO GET INTO ENDICRAN DISRUPTORS AND THINGS THAT SORT BUT SINCE YOU BROUGHT IT UP AM YOU  I'VE HEARD THINGS SUCH AS OCAY THINGS LIKE EVENING PRIMROSE OYL IF MAM IS PUTTING EVENING PRIMROSE OIL HONORS HAS IT IN HER CHAMPOO THAT I'VE HEARD OF YOUNG MALES GETTING A PRECOCIOUS BREASTBOD DEVELOPMENT KEEP IN MIND FOLKS THAT SOME TRANSIENT BREASTBOD DEVELOPMENT IS A CARACTERISTIC OF SOME NORMAL PUBERT ES AND MALES IT SOMETIMES SHOWS UP AND GOES LIKE NEW SOME KITS LIKE THAT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THEY GOT TEASILOB AND THEN THEY STOP GETTING TEAS HOFLY NOWDAYS THEY DON'T TEAS I BUT WHEN I WAS GROWING UP THOSE KITS GOT TEAS NOT BY MEA BUT BY OTHER PEOPLE BUT IT WAS NORMAL WHEN IT PASSED FOR FOR SOME RIGHT IT OCCURRED ABNORMALLY THEN PASSED BUT I'VE HEARD THAT THINGS LIKE EXPOSURE TO EVENING PRIMROSE OIL MAY BE EVEN JUST THROUGH CONTACT WITH MAM CAN A INCREASE THE THE FREQUENCY OR DEGREE OF THAT MAL BREASTBY DEVELOPMENT IS IT ALSO TRUE THAT YOUNG GIRLS CAN UNDERGO PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY OR LET SHOU SAY ACCELERATER EXASCERATED PUBETY AM THROUGH CONTACT WITH THINGS LIKE EVENIN PRIMROSE OIL WHICH IS A I THINK HAS SOME PSUDO ESTROGEN LIKE PROPERTY IT'S IMPORTANT TO DIFFERENTIATE THAT THE SECONDARY SEX CHARACTERSTIX WE SEE LIKE BRESBED DEVELOPMENT ARE FROM ESTROGEN BUT IT'S NOT REALLY PUBERTY BEING INITIATED WHEN IT'S FROM AN INTERCRAN DISCREPTING CHEMICAL SO TAKING YOU'VE EEN EXPOSED TO EVENING PRIMROSE OR LAVENDER OR TEATREE ALE IN A MALE ISN'T GOING TO CAUSE HIM TO START TO GO INTO PUBERTY BUT IT IS GOING TO EXPOSE HIM TO ESTRGEN WHEN HIS BODY IS NOT AND THEREFORE STIMULATE SOME BRESTBUD DEVELOPMENT SAME THING CAN HAPPEN IN YOUNG GIRLS MEANING THEY COULD SHOW SOME OF THOSE SECONDARY SEX SIGNS EARLIER THAN THEY NORMALLY WED AND THIS IS WHY IF THAT'S HAPPENING AT A REALLY YOUNG AGE KAN SHAGO TO A PEDIATRIC ANDTECHRONOLOGISTS WHO ARE GIN TO CHECK THINGS LIKE BONE AGE AND SEE IF YOU REALLY STARTED THE PUBERTY PROCESS OR NOT OR IS IT AN OUTSIDE EXPOSURE WHICH IS CAUSING IT INTERESTINGLY ABOUT THE YOUNG CHILD EXPOSURE AND DEVELOPMENT THE OTHER THING TO SAY THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING AND RELEVANT IN MY FIELD IS THA HEN WE THINK ABOUT HOW MANY EGGS ARE IN THE VAULT AND EVERYBODY'S BORN WITH THIS DIFFERENT NUMBER AND I'M SURE WE'LL TALK ABOUT OVERIAN RESERVE WHAT WE NOW KNOW IS OF THE VAULT YOUR OVERIES ARE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO WHATEVER YOUR MOTHER DOES WHEN SHE'S PREGNANT WITH YOU AND HAT THAT EPIGENETIC THAT PRO GRAMMING WHICH IS HAPPENING IS PREDISPOSING YOUNG WOMEN TO PROBABLY HAVING SOME OF THEM LOW OVEING RESERVE SOME OF THEM HAVING DISEAS AS WE ASSOCIATE WITH IN VERTILITY LIKE PESE TIOAS ARE IN DEMETRIOSAS AND WE HAVEN'T YET CHARACTERIZE WHAT ALL THEY ARE BUT IF WE LOOK AT THE INCIDENTS OF SOME OF THESE DISESE THAT WEE SEE NOW WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE TIME PERIOD OF WHICH THESE PEOPLE WERE PREGNANT THE ADIES AND NINETIES WAS NOT THE HEALTHIEST TIME WHEN IT COMES TO INTERCINTRECEPTORS ANE PLASSIC EXPOSURES IN CHAMICALS AND ALL OF THIS PROCESS STUFF WHAT'S TO SAY THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO THOUGH WERE REALLY SEEING THAT THOSE THAT AR VARING SUSCEPTIBILITY TO EGG QUALITY ANG QUANTITY HAPPENS IN THAT BEEDALE DEVELOPMENT PERIOD SINTERESTING A BECAUSE THERE SOME A PARALLELS TO MAIL FEEDALE DEVELOPMENT LIKE THE THE FACT THAT OF THESE EARLY ORGANIZEING EFFECTS OF HORMONS LIKE THE HADRISASTOSTRONE WHICH ESSENTIALLY STIMULATE THE GROWTH OF THE PENIS BUT ALSO THEN ESTABLISH A A PROPENSITY FOR ORMOSTERING PUBEITY TO ACTIVATE GROWTH OF THE SEX ORDANS BUT ALSO ACTIVATE THE BRAIN ARIAS A RESPONSIBLE FOR A HOST OF DIFFERENT THINGS SO I ONLY MENTION THAT BECAUSE A WHAT I LIKE TO CAN OF ILLUSTRATE IN THE BACKGROUND HERES THAT A BASICALLY A REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH BEGINS REALLY PRIATE PRIV TO CONCEPTION REALLY ITS AT DEPENDENT ON MAM ENDAD BUT A CERTAINLY TO A GREAT DEGREE ON ON MAM A BUT THEN FEEDALE DEVELOPMENTS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT SO SORT OF A AS A BEING ABLE TO PICK OUR PARENTS AH I I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT LAVENDER TTRIO AND EVENING PRIMROSE ALL I WAS AWARE THAT EVENING PRIMOS OIL OILSCUSE ME CAN A SOMEHOW BIND ESTRGEM RECEPTORS IT ORMIMIC AS SOME OF THE ESTRODIAL OR SOMETHING SIMILAR TO IT I WASN'T AWARE OF TE TREE OIL OR LAVENDER A HERE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT OILS WHAT AB OUT AROMAS AND HOW CONCERN DO PEOPLE HAVE TO BE ABOUT THIS STUFF BECAUSE HAVING YOU KOW YOU'LL GO INTO A RESTAURANT BATHROOM THEY'LL BE POPERE AH SOME PEOPLE WEAR PERFUME AN  UT WE DON'T WANT TO SET OF PARINOISO NO O BUT OT BUT I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE STUFF TETRIOLS IN A LOT OF THOSE UN NATURAL SHAMPOO A LOT OF TH SO ONES THATRANT THE ONE THAT TINGLE YOUR SCAW AS A LIKE THOG ONE PEOPLE LOVE THEM THOUGH CONSTANT EXPOSURE IS VERY DIFFERENT THEN ONE TIME HAND WASHING IN THE BATHROOM AND I THINK THAT'S THE BIG DIFERENCE FOR EVERYTHING WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CHEMICALS OR TOXSINS OR EXPOSURES IN THE WORLD YOU CAN'T LIVE IN A TOXIN FREE WORLD BUT CHOOSING WHAT YOU PUT IN AND ON YOUR BODY ON A REGULAR BASIS DOES SAT THE TONE FOR CERTAIN PHYSIOLOGIC CHANGS AND SO YOU KNOW USING UNCENTED PRODUCTS ESPECIALLY WITH CHILDREN AS A REARLY AN IMPORTANT THING BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR LIFETIME EXPOSURE TO SOME OF THESE THINGS ESPECIALLY DOING CRIDICAL TIMES IS MUCH LESS AND SO YOU'LL SEE PEOPLE RECOMMEND THINGS LIKE YOUR LAUNTRY TO CHARGE AT YOU KNOW WHAT CENSORE IN YOUR LAUNDRY TO CHURGE IN THE SHAM POO AND CONDITIONER ARE A BIG ONE AND THE SOAPS THAT YOU USE ON A DATO DAY BASIS IN YOUR HOUSE OR THE OILS YOU PUT ON YOUR BODY LAVENDERS HUGE BECAUSE THERE'S THIS WHOLE COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE THEY WANTE ROB LAVENDER OIL ON THEIR BABYES FEE AND HELP THEM SLEE BUT REALLY WE CAN SEE AND SOMEBODY GOES AND SHADOWS OF PEDIOCTRIC ANTERCHNOLEGIST FOR A DAY THEY'LL SEE SOME KITS COME IN AND THIS WILL BE THER REASON WHY WHAT ABOUT CLOTH DIPERS VERSES NON CLOTH DIPERS  HEARD HE OTHAT YOU HAVE YOUR LIKE VERY STRONG CLOTH DRIPER PROPONENTS RIGHT IN THE BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO AM FEEL OR BELIEVE THAT A NONCLOTH DIPERS SOMEHOW CONTAIN THINGS THAT CAN GET INTO BABYS SKIN AND AND MAYBE THERE'S A BIGGER QUESTION HERE IS BABY SKIN MORE PERMUABLE THEN OH I DON'T DON'T KNOW THAT BABY SKIN IS MORE PERNI DON LIRA IT TO ME IT SEEMS I THINK IS  UD BE HARD TO IMAGINE IT IS BUT BUT BABIES DO SEEN TO HAVE 'S INCREDIBLE SKIN RIGHT THEIR SKIN IS SO SMEARING NOT YOU MUST SQUEEZE THEIR CHEEKS IN LO ALL THIS KIN A STUFF BUT AM YET THE IDEA THEY'LL BE MORE PERMIABLE I THINK IT'S MORE THAT THEIR DEVELOPMENT IS THIS TIME IS VERY IMPORTANT AND SETTING THE STAGE FOR A LOT OF WHAT HAPPENS LATER VERSES IN ADULTHOOD THOSE STEPWISE DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESSES OF AURDY HAPPENED SO I THINK THAT'SWAT WE PAYS SOE MUCH ATTENTION TO WHAT HAPPENS IN THE YOU KNOW CHILDHOOD PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE WHERE NOW LEARNING ABOUT THOSE LATER CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT YOU ARE EXPOSED TO IT'S NOT THAT YOU KNOW REGULAR DIPERS VERSES CLOTH WHATEVER WE WANT TO SAY IT ONTS NECESSARILY BETTER THAN THE OTHER IT'S MORE HONESTLY OF PERSONAL PREFERENCE BABIES ARE EXPOSED TO THEM A LOT AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ATTENTION TO THAT BUT SIMILAR LEAST SOMEBODY COULD USE CLOTH AND WASH ET WITH A DETURNGENT THAT THEN YOU KNOW HAW CERTAIN CHEMICALS IN IT SO THERE HASN'T BEEN A STUDY SHOWN THAT THIS ONE THING IS AN EXPOSURE FOR A BABY THAT SOMEBODY NEEDS TO BE WORRIED ABOUT THERE'S DEFINITELY COMPANIES NOW WHICH ARE PROMODING AND TALKING ABOUT NO TRADITIONAL DIPERS THAT THEY ARE MAKING SURE HAVE LESS TALK SENSE AN THEM AND I ALWAYS THINK ANY TIME YOU CAN DECREASE TALKS IN EXPOSURE TO A CHILD IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT CERETANY EVIDENCE FOR A YOU KNOW BRESMIL FERSES FORMULA IN TERMS OF I IMPACT ON FUTURE REPRODUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT OF REPRODUCTIVE STATIS OF OF A CHILD THAT'S A COMPLICATED QUESTION BECAUSE BREASTMILK EXPOSURE AT LEAST FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF A CHILD'S LIFE CERTAINLY HELPS WITH THE IMIAN SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND WE KNOW THAT POOR IMMUNE DEVELOPMENT CAN LEAD TO HIGHE RISK OF OTUUMMUN DISEASE LATER WHAT PEOPLE CALL LEAKY GOT AND SOME OF THOSE DISEASES CERTAINLY ARE CORRELATER WITH FERTILITY SO I WOULDN'T SAY WE'VE GONE SO FAR TO SAY THAT IF YOU DON'T BREAST FEED YOUR CHILD THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE FERTILITY ISSUES BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE'S AN INBETWEEN CORRELATION WITH THINGS THAT BREASS FEEDING AS PROTECTIVE AGAINST AND HOW THOSE S DISEASES THEMSELVES MAY RELATES O FRATILITY AND THE FEMALE LATER ON O CASE SOFER UM THINKING ABOUT A YOUNG GIRL SLASH WOMAN CAS RETIME OUT PUBERTY WRITE SO AT  DON'T WHAT EXACT NOMENT CLATURE IS THERE YOU KNOW WHAT MY EXPERIENCES ALL AL OFFEND AND UM SOMEBODY NO MATTER WHAT EM BUT A GIRL WHO UNDERGOES PUBERTY WRITS A YOUNG WOMAN UM WHOS MAYBE THIRTEEN OR SO SO SHES EARLY TEENS A'M UNDERGOES PUBITY AND THEREFORE IS CONTINUING TO LS EGGS FROM THE VAULT UM BUT NOW IS UNDERGOING A PRESUMABLY ROUGHLY EVERY TWENTY EGHT DAYS MANARKEEPBLE LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS TWENTY EIGHT DAYS THING BECAUS AY OA PEOPLE THINK THAT AUM QUODEN QUOTE NORMAL MENSTRUATION IS ALWAYS TWENTY EIGHT DAYS AND AND WE KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUTE SAND WHAT IS THE THE RANGE OF A NORMAL A DURATIONS BETWEEN UM MENSTRUATIONS A CYCLES OR DURATION OF THE MENSTRUATION CYCLE AND LET'S ALSO DEFINE WHEN THE MENSTRUATION CYCLE STARTS PROBABLY FOR THE MALES MOSTLY IN THE ONWERWERE SO LET'S THINK THROUGH THE CYCLE WILL DO A QUICK ONE OVER AND THEN ANSWER THE QUESTIONS SO WHAT WE THINK OF A CYCLE DAY ONE OR WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO SAY THIS STARTS AS CAN BE THE DAY THESE ART BLEEDING SO THAT'S ACTUALLY SHUDDING THE ENDEMETRIAL LINING FROM WHAT GRUE THE LAST TIME SO ANY SPOTTING EVEND WOULD BE CONSIDERED AY ONE  SO IT IS WE CAN GET BACK TO THI PROBLEM ATIC IF YOU A LOT OF SPOTDING BEFORE THAT FULL FLOW STARTS A DAY OR SO CAN BE REALLY NORMAL JUST AS THE BODIES ADJUSTING TO THE DROPING PROJESTAROWN BUT LESS IS START ATHE BEGINNING DAYWINE YOU HAVE A PERIOD A MENSEES THIS AS WHEN YOU'R ACTUALLY BLEEDING AT THIS STIME PERIOD WE LIKE THINK ABOUT ALL OF THOSE NEW EGGS BEING OUT OF THE VAULT BEING SUSCEPTIBLE TO THAT EFFESAGE WHICH OF COURSE IS THAT WELL NAME TORMON BECAUSE IT STIMULATES THE PHOLICAL TO GROW AND EACH EGG AS ANAPHOLICAL THAT EGG STARTS TO GROW AND MAKES ESTRAGEM THAT ESTERGAN STIMULATES THE PROLIFERATION OF THE LINING OF THE UTERIS AND PREPARATION FOR POTENTIALLY THAT PREGNANCY THAT MAKE OME AND ALSO THAT ESTEROGEN MAKES YOUFEEL REARLLY GREAT RA THAS THE FELICULAR PHASE NAMESO BECAUSE THAT POLICAL IS GROWING AND ITS AN EFASAGE DOMINANT PHASE WHERE YOU HAVE A LOT OF ESTEROGEN AND WE WILL FEEL GREAT WHEN THEY HAVE A LOT OF ESTEROGEN YELBECOOMEN FEEL GOOD WITH SROGEN BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ESTEROGEN AND OTHER NERMODULATORS LIKE TE OPENING SURATONE AND AND N IS THAT HAPPENING IN PARALLEL OR THEY SOMEHOW RELATED LIKE IS ESTEROGEN CONTROLLING THE RELEASE OF SURTONE AND SOMEHOW AND VICE FIRST A WHERE THEY JUST COND OF COINCIDENTLY HAPPENING IN PARALLEL WE DOUTFULLY THINK THAT THERES MORE OF A CORRELATION CAUSATION THAN JUST COINCIDENCE BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE'S TIME PERAE TO PEOPLE ARE MORE DEPRESSED WITHIN YOUR CYCL CORRELATING WITH THOSE LO ESTERGEN LEVELS AND WE KNOW THAT WHEN YOU GOING TO MENAPAUS ORE YOU RUN OUT A EGGS AND YOU'RE NOW IN A LOW ESTEROGEN PHASE WE SEE A LOT MORE OF A DEPRESSE TOMOOD AND YOU KNOW ANADONIA LACK OF RESPONSE TO THINGS WHICH WERE NORMALLY GIVE YOU PLEASURE HAPPENS MORE FREQUENTLY THE FEMALE BRAIN LOVES ESTEROGE AND ITS PROTECTIVE AGAINST THINGS LIKE DIMENTIA SO THIS IS A TIME PERIOD WHERE WOMEN ARE GOING TO BE MORE ENERGETIC THE'RE GON HOW MORE ENERGY MORE PHOCUS THIS IS THE ESTEROGEN DOMINANT PHASE OF THE CYCL AND WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN THAT ESTEROGEM AT ITS HIGH LEVELS WHICH ITS ONLY MADE FROM A MATURE PHOLICAL AND ITS VERY SPECIFIC TWO HUNDRED PECAGRAMS PERMELATOR FOR FIFTY HOURS THAT'S THE BRAINS CLUE OCE WE MUST HAVE A MATUR AG AND IT CAN SEND OUT THAT SURGE OF ELATE ARE LUTINIZING HOARMOM AND NOW YOU OBULATE ND WHEN YOU OBULATE THE PHOLICAL OPENS UP RELESAS CLOSES BACK AND THEN ITS THE CORPUS LUDIUM AND WE'VE ENTER THE LUDIAL PHASE AND THE CORPUS LUDIUM IS THE NAME SUGGEST TE CORPUS IS LIKE A BODY THI BASILY THE IT'S AD BAS IT'S BASICALLY THE TECORPSE OF OF WHAT THE ITS THIS ATACHI YES IA CH THE EGG BEFORE A AND IT WHAT WOULD I FIND SO AMAZING A INBIOLOGY SO BEAUTIFUL AND IT INSTEAD OF JUST TAKING THAT TISSUE IN SANOKE LIKE LISTUS DISCARD THIS OR A THAT BECOMES THE TR GROUP FOR THE NEXT PUS IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR LIFE RIT THE CORPUS LUDIUM WHICH MAKES PROJESTERON OPENS ANDCLOSES THE IMPLANTATION WINDOW IT IS WHAT ALLOW SOMEBODY TO GET PREGNANT AND FOR OUR SPECIES TO CONTINOU IT'S SO IT'S EXTREMELY FASCINATING AND THAT CORPUS LUDIUM GETS STIMULATED TO PRODUCE PROJESTERAN IMPULSES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE LUDIAL PHASE BECAUSE IT STILL CONTROLLED BY THE BRAIN UNLESS YOU GET PREGNANT AND THEN IN THAT LUDIAL PHASE PROJESTER OWN IS FASCINATING IT'S TRYING TO PROTECT YOU FROM THINGS WHICH COIPOTENTIALLY HARM YOUR BABY SO SUDDENLY NOW YOU'VE LESS ENERGY YOU AN A SLET ORE YOU WANT O EAT MORE YOU MAY BE DO NOT WANT A HALF SEX AS MUCH BECAUSE YOUR BODY IS SUDDENLY SAYING LET'S JUST PROTECT O THIS POTENTIAL INPLANTATION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE IF THAT PREGNANCY DOESN'T COME THE CORPOUS LUDIUM CAN ONLY LIVE TWELVE TO FOURTEEN DAYS IT HAS A VERY DISTINCT LIFE SPAN AND THEN IT DIES YOUR ESTROGENT AND PROJSTER OWN BOTH DROP YOU BELIED STARTING OVER THE NEXT CYCLE AND A NEW GROUP OF FOLICALS COMES OUT TO BE RELEASED AND THE REASON WHY WALKING THROUGH THAT VERY SISTINCTLY BUT IS IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE ASKING HOW LONG IS THE NORMAL CYCLE BECAUSE THE LUDIAL PHASE IS PRETTY SET AT TWELVE TO FOURTEEN DAYS THE FALICULAR PHASE CAN VERY IN PERSON TO PERSON AND WHAT WE KNOW THOUGH IS FOR ONE INDIVIDUAL IF YOU'RE MINSTRUAL CYCLE YOUR REPRETIVE HORMONS ARE WORKING RIGHT IT SHOULD BE RELATIVELY CONSTANT FOR YOU AND SO IF YOUR PERIODS ARE EVERY TWENTY FOUR DAYS BUT THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN EVERY TWENTY FOUR TO TWENTY FIVE DAYS THEN THAT'S NOT CONCERNING AND IF YOUR PERIODS ARE EVERY THIRTY THREE DAYS BUT THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN EVERY THIRTY THREE DAYS THEN THAT'S NOT CONCERNING BUT WE DO GET CONCERNED WHEN THERE'S A CHANGE IN YOUR PERIOD OR WE GET CONCERNED WHEN PEOPLE HAVE WHAT I LIKE TO SAY IS IR REGULARLY REGULAR PERIODS BECAUSE WHAT YOU'LL SEE TEXT BOOKS TELL YOU IS THAT YOUR PERIODS COULD BE AS SURET IS TWENTY ONE DAYS AS L ONG IS THIRTY FIVE DAYS AND THAT CAN ALL BE NORMAL BUT PEOPLE WILL HOP BETWEEN THEM THE'LLHAVE ONE CYCLE THAT IS TWENTY FOUR DAYS IN LENGTH FROM DAY ONE TO THE LAST DAY BEFORE THE NEXT DAY ONE THAN THE NEXT CYCLES THIRTY TO AND THEN IT'S TWENTY SIX AND THEN IT'S THIRTY FOUR AND THAT'S NOT NORMAL THAT'S TOO IRREGULAR AND THAT CAN BE A SIGN THAT SOMETHING IS NOT COMMUNICATING CORRECTLY WITHIN YOUR REPRODUCTIVE CORMONES SO WHAT I TELL PATIENCE IS IN GENERAL YOUR PERIOD SHOULD BE LESS THAN THIRTY FIVE DAYS APART AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK AT A CALENDAR AND WITH YOUR FINGER PUT A FINGER ON THE DATE AND WITHIN A COUPLE DAYS OF ACCURACY BE ABLE TO PREDICT WHEN YOUR PERIODS COMING AND IF YOU CAN'T THERE COULD LIKELY BE SOMETHING THAT IS INTERFERING WITH THE HORMONAL SIGNALS BETWEEN THE BRAIN AND THE OVERY AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST REALLY ONE OF THE ONLY THINGS WE SEE AS WOMEN START TO HAVE FEWER EGGS IN THE VAULT IS A SHORTENING OF THEIR CYCLES SO YOU HAVE A REGULAR PERIOD AND SUDDENLY NOW YOU'VE LESS EX IN THE VAULT SO LESS ARE COMING OUT EACH MONTH AND WHEN THE BRAIN SENDS OUT THAT F S AGE SIGNAL NOW THERE'S FEWER EGG SO IT'S NOT GETTING AS DELUTE AND YOU HAVE ONE STARTING TO RESPOND SOONER SO SUDDENLY YOUR OBULATING SHORTER FASTER IN YOUR CYCLE YOU'RE OBULATING ON CYCLE DAT NINE INSTEAD OF FOURTEEN YOUR LUDIAL PHASES STILL SET BUT THE PERSON WHO COMES TO SEE ME AND SAYS MY PERIODS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TWENTY EIGHT TO THIRTY DAYS BUT NOW THEYRE EVERY TWENTY FOUR I JUST FIGURE IS NOBIG DEAL I AM IVE RED FLAGS GOING OFF EVERYWHERE BECAUSE I'M NOW REALLY CONCERNED THAT POTENTIALLY THEIR OVERIAN RESERVE HAS DROPPED TO A POINT WHERE WE ARE STARTING TO SEE CLINICAL CHANGES NOW OF COURSE THINGS LIKE FIBRUARY AND PROLACED IN AN OTHER CORMONES CAN ALSO CAUST SUCH CHANGES BUT THAT'S WHY YOU'LL HEAR MOST REPRODUCTIVE INTERCRONOLOGIST SAY YOUR PERIODS OF VITAL SIING AND WHAT WE REALLY MEAN IS THE REGULARITY AT WHICH IT COMES AND THE PREDIC TABILITY OF IT IS TALLIAN ASS IF YOUR HARMOUNS ARE I'LL COMMUNICATIN AN ENORMAL FACTION OR IF SOMETHING CONPONTENTIALLY BE OFF AS WE ALL KNOW QUALITY NUTRITION INFLUENCES OF COURSE OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH BUT ALSO OUR MENTAL HEALTH AND ORE COGNIVE FUNCTIONING OUR MEMORY OUR ABILITY TO LEARN NEW THINGS AND TO FOCUS AND WE KNOW THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES OF HIGH QUALITY NUTRITION IS MAKING SURE THAT WE GET ENOUGH VIDEMENS AND MINERALS FROM HIGH QUALITY UNPROCESSED OR MINIMILY PROCESS SOURCES AS WELL AS ENOUGH PROBITICS AND PREBOTICS AND FIBER TO SUPPORT BASIALLY ALL THE CELLAR FUNCTIONS IN OUR BODY INCLUDING THE GUP MICROBIOM NOW I LIKE MOST EVERYBODY TRY TO GET OPTIMAL NUTRITION FROM WHOLE FOODS IDEALLY MOSTLY FROM MINIMALY PROCESSED OR NONPROCESS FOODS HOWEVER ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I AND SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE FACE IS GETTING ENOUGH SERVINGS OF HIGH QUALITY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES PER DAY AS WELL AS FIBER AND PROBIOTICS THAT OFTEN ACCOMPANY THOSE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT'S WHY WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND IN TWELTEH LONG BEFORE I EVER HAD  PODCAST I STARTED DRINKING A G ONE AND SO I'M DELIGHTED THE A G ONE IS SPONSORING THE HUBERMANLAB PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING A G ONE AND THE REASON I STILL DRINK A G ONE ONCE OR TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT PROVIDES ALL OF MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS THAT IS IT PROVIDES INSURANCE THAT I GET THE PROPER AMOUNTS OF THOSE VIEMENS MINERALS PROBIOTICS AND FIBER TO INSURE OPTIMAL MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY A G ONE YOU CAN GO TO DRINK A G ONE DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEYRE GIVING AWAY FI FREE TRAVEL PAK PLUSS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VIDEMEN D THREE K TWO AGAIN THAT'S DRINK A G ONE DOCCM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THAT SPECIAL OFFER MISIF I HAVE THIS CRRECT UM WE'VE GOT THIS THING THAT WE CALL THE MENSTRAL CYCLETHE OVULATORY CYCLE THE THERE'S TWO PHASES A FELICULAR PHASE AN A LUDIO PHASE FLICKERE PRECEDES THE LUDIOL PHASE THE LUDIOPHADES TENDS TO BE FIHERED CRICALLY AN FAIRLY FIXED ABOUT FOURTEEN DAYS UM THE FELICULAR PHASE CAN VARY IN DURATIO EN MAYBE TEN TO FOURTEEN DAYS MAYBE VEN TEN TO EIGHTEEN DAYS DEPENDING ON THE PERSON I  SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR BRAIN TO OVERE COMMUNICATION FOR THOSE THAT UM AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH THIS UM THE ILWAYS LEARNED THAT ESTROGEN PRIMES PROGESTROWN THIS CAND THE THE REALLY BASIC TOP CONTOUR DESCRIPTION OF THE OVULITORY CYCLE THAT UNESTEROGEN IS GIN A SLOWLY CLIME TOWARD THE THE POINT OF OBULATION AND THEN THERE'S THERE'S ROPK AND THEN A DROP AND THEN PROGESTERON IS GOING TO DOMINATE IN THE LUDIAL FACE THE SECOND HALF YOU SAID THAT ESTROGEN UM IS ASSOCIATED WITH WITH A PSYCHOLOGICAL LEVEL IN A PHYSIOLOGICAL LEVEL WERE ENERGY UM FEELINGS OF VITOLITY AND SOME OF THAT ESTROGEN INCREASE IS ACTUAY COMING FROM THE ONE EGG THET GOT STIMULATED THE MOST THA WEN THE GON SELECTED IS  PICKED FOR THE TEAM ONPOTENTIALLY FOR THE TEAM BUT GOT PICKED O POTENTILLY FOR FERTILIZATION AND THAT EG SHEDS ITS CORPUS LUDIUM O WHICH IS THI PIECE OF THI OF THE EGG THAT THEN TRIGGERS THE PROGESTERONE THET DOMINATES THE LUDIAL FACE TO HAVE THAT RIGHT A MOSTLY MOTL CYET PLEASE CORRECT EN WERE Y UNCLE AN WHICH THE EGGGROWS RIGHT WHEN YOU OVULATE IT RUPTURES THE CISTBER OPHOLICALS ASSIST ASSIST AS A FLUIDFELT STRUCTURE PHOLICALS OF FLUIFELSTRUCTURE THAT HOLDS AN AGG SO WHEN YOU OBULATEING YOU GET THAT ELLAGE SARGE THE SIST BIRSTS AT OPENS UP AND THE EGG COMES OUT OF IT AND THEN IT REHEELS AND BECOMES THE CORPUS LUDI NOT SO JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT ANTIMIN AND YOU WRITE WITH ESTEROGEN PRIMES PROGESTEROWN BUT REALLY WE THINK ABOUT AT THE LAYER OF THE UTERESTS BECAUSE ESTEROGEN STIMULATES THE GROWTH OF THAT LININE AND THEN PROGESTERON STABLIZES IT AND ALLOUS AND PLANTATION TO A CAR BUT THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS OF WHEN YOU ARE ESTEROGEN DOMINANT AND PROGESTOROWN DEFICIENT WHICH IS THE FALICULAR PHASE AND PEOPLE WILL COME IN HAVING LABS ER ON RANDUMLY AND THERE ALL CONCERND THAT THEY DON'T HAVE PROGESTOR OWN AND WHEN YOU TALK TO THEM BUT WHERE THEY ARE IN THEIR PCYCWEL YOU SAY YOU NOT SUPPOSE HAF PRODESTEROWN THAT'S YOUR FULICULAR PHASE THIS IS PERFECTLY NORMAL GREAT THINKS FOR THAT CLARIFICATION I GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT BIRTH CONTROL BUT ON MY SOCIAL MEDIA HANDLES  A E ATO BE CLEAR AM THIS IT'S A VAST TOPIC FOR EXPLORATION BUT ALONG LINES O WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW I'VE HEARD AND I SUSPECT IT MAY NOT BE TRUE BUT TELL ME IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT TAKING BIRTH CONTROL CAN DISTRRUPT THE PROCESS THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBE IN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BIRTH CONTROL WE SHOULD POLLY TE FIND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO THERE ARE A HORMON BASEBIRTH CONTROLS A GAVE THE PILL THERE ALSO HORMON BASE BIRTH CONTROLS THAT ARE NOT IN PILLFORM AM THERE ARE IUDESE THATR COPPER AUDEES TER OTHER IUDES LITLISES TALK ABOUT HORMON BASE CONTRACEPTION IN FEMALES AGAIN A IF WHICH MANY OF THEM AS I UNDERSTAND AR ESTEROGEN MAY MAXSIR ESTRGEN THEMSELVES THAT SUPPRESS OVULATION DO THEY DIMINISH WERE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF EGGS THAT ARE TAKEN FROM THE VAULT FANTASTA QUESTION LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE SAY AS THE PELL SO THET SPECIFICALLY TALK ABOUT COMBINED OR A CONTRACEPTION AND THE PELL WHICH HAS AFINAL ESTERDILE AND SOME TYPE OF PRODESTON NO CONTRACEPTION DOES NOT CHANGE THE RELEASE OF EGGS OUT OF THE VAULT THEY ARE CURRING AT THE SAME PROCESS AN THE SAME PATHWAY YOU'RE NOT ODULATING BECAUSE THAT ESTURGEN DOES PREVENT AFESATES FROM COMING FROM THE BRAIN SO YOU HAVE THE GROUP OF EGGS STILL COME OUT OF THE VAULT THERE'S NO EFFESS AGE THEY JUST ALL DIE THE NEXT SCROUP COMES OUT SO WHEN YOU ARE SAYING ARE YOU GOING TO RUN OUT A EGGS FASTER IS A GOUN O HARM YOUR FATILITY DOES BIRTH CONTROL AND PAIR THE PROCESS THE ANSWERS NO BUT THERE'S A COUPLE INPORNT CAVIATS ONE IS THAT THE BIRTH CONTROL PELLS ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE THEM CONTINUEASLY OR FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME THE THE BODY SMART AND THAT RIES ARE TO SAY WE'RE NOT REALLY DOING ANYTHING AND ONE OF THOSE MARKERS OF A VERY RESERVE WE HAVE IS A MH AND THAT'S ANTIMULARIAN HORMOM AND A AHIS MADE FROM THE GRANULOSA CELLS OR THE CELLS THAT SURROUND EVERY FOLICAL SO IN THE SHORTEST WAY POSSIBLE MORE EGS AN THE ALL MORE COME OUT EVERY MOUNT HIGHER AMAH YOU ARE EGS AN TOF ALL YEU ARE COME OUT LOWER  MAH YOUR AMAH IS BEING SUPPRESSED BECAUSE OF THE BIRTH CONTROL PILL BECAUSE IT'S DECREASING THE ACTIVITY OF THOSE GRAN ELOSA CELLS YOU MIGHT GET A LOW A MAH VALUE WHEN YOU'VE BEEN ON THE BIRTH CONTROL PILL FOR A LONG TIME THAT IS COMPLETELY REVERSIBLE BUT IT CAN BE SIGNIFICANT SO IF SOMEBODY IS WANTING TO GET IN A MAH LEVEL LET SAY SOMEBODY COMES TO MY CLENEC THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO GET PREGNANT AND THERE ON THE PELL AND THERE CONSIDERING FREEZING THEIR EGGS  WE'RE GOING TO CHECK THEIR OVERIAN RESERVE IF WE DRAW IT I ALWAYS SAY THIS AMAH MAY BE UP TO DIRTY PER CENT LOWER IN SOMEBODY WHO IS ON THE BIRTH CONTROL PELL SO WE CAN STILL DRAW IT AND IF IT COMES BACK IN THE NORMAL RANGE WE SHALL GET BUT IF IT DOES COME BACK LOW WE'RE ON HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION ARE WE GOING TO STOP THE BIRTH CONTROL PELL FOR A PERIOD OF SOME MONTHS YOU'SE ALL TURNATIVE CONTRACEPTION IF YOU DON'TWAN TO BE PREGNANT AND THEN REPEAT THIS TEST TO SEE IF THIS IS A TRUE LOW BECAUSE WE DO SEE THAT YOUNG WOMEN DO OU HAVE LOW AVERIN RESERVE SOMETIMES OR WAS THIS JUST SUPPRESSED BECAUSE YOU WERE ON THE BIRTH CONTROL PELL SO WE SEE IT IMPACT SOME OF THE HORMON TESTING THAT WE CAN DO AND YTHING THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION AND WE CAN SEE THAT THE LONGER YOU TAKE IT THAT POTENTIALLY IT MIGHT ACTUALLY IMPROVE YOUR FERTILITY IF YOU HAD UNDERLYING IN DEMETRIOSES OR SOME MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT WE SEE ASSOCIATED WITH INFERTILITY SO PROLONGED PILLUSERS CAN POTENTIALLY IMPROVE THEIR FERTILITY VERSES PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO GET PREGNANT THAT SAME AGE WHO WERE NOT ON THE PLL THOSE STUDIES ARE COMPLICATED RIGHT B HAS A SELECTION BY US BECAUSE IF YOU'VE BEEN ON THE PILL FOR TEN YEARS YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT OLDER SO IS IT THAT THEY WERE PREVENTING PREGNANCY IN THE OTHER GROUP POTENTIALLY HAD SOME EXPOSURE SO THEY WERE INHERENTLY MORE INFERTILE THAN THE GROUP THAT WAS ON THE PILL BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THE PIL DOESN'T CAUSE IN FARTILITY AND I USE IT ALL THE TIME ALL THE TIME AND IVI OF CYCLES WE BUT PEOPLE ON THE BIRTH CONTROL PILL BECAUSE WE CAN ACTUALLY SYNCRONIZED THAT GROUP OF EGGS THAT COMES OUT OF THE VAULT TO GROW TOGETHER BECAUSE YOUR BODY DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE TWENTY BABIES AT ONE TIME WRIGHT AND WE WERE TRYING TO DO WITH IVIOF GET TWENTY EGGS TO GROW IF THAT'S WAT'S OUT OF THE VAULT REALLY GOES AGAINST THE CHECK ENBALANCE OF THE HUMAN BODY TO NOT HAVE TWENTY BABIES AT ONCE WHY IS IT THAT MALS WHO TAKE TO STASTRNE SINCETI TO STASTRONE IT SHUTS DOWN THEIR OWN TESTASTRON PRODUCTION INSPIRN PRODCTION BUT FEMALES WO TAKE ESTRAGEN IN THE FORM OF RECONTRAL PILLS ADOESINSHUCDOWN ESTRAGIN PRODUCTION BY THE OVERS SO I LOVE THIS QUESTION YOU KNOW THE ANSER SO I LIKE AT EXTRA BICAUSE IN A OUR ASKING MSPERMATA GENESIS IS A CONSTANT AND ON GOING PROCESS RIGHT SO IN WOMEN YOU'RE BORN WITH ALL THE EGGS AR EVER GOING TO HAVE AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AS IF WE STOP AFASATI AT THAT MOMENT WE'RE JUST IMPACTING THE ABILITY TO OVULATE AT THAT TIME BUT WE'RE NOT CHANGING THIS CONSTANT LOST THROUGHOUT THE VAULT SPERMATA GENESES RIGHT THE SPIRM IS MADE EVERY SINGLE NAY YOU'RE MAKIN BRANDY'S FIRM SO SEVENTY TWO DAYS FOR THE SPIRM TO BE CREATED IN THE TESTES AND EIGHTEEN DAYS TO FIND THEIR WAY OUT THE EJACULATORY SYSTEM AND SO EXPOSURES THAT YOU HAVE THAT STOP THE PRODUCTION OF AFASAON ALL AGE INHIBOT THE DEVELOPMENT THE CREATION OF NEW SPIRM SO SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN ON TESTA STRONE WE'LL TELL THE BRAIN THE BRAIN DOESN'T KNOW IS FROM YOUR TAKING IT IT SAYS HEY WE HAVE PLENTY OF SPIRM WERE GOOD WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE SO THE BRAIN THAN GET SUPPRESSED AND DOESN'T MAKE THAT AFFASATION L AGE THEREFORE NOT STIMULATING BOTH FURTHER TESTASTERON PRODUCTION CAUSE YOU DON'T NEED THAT BUT TESAUCERON PRODUCTION AN SPIRM PRODCTION GO HAND IN HAND SO THEREFORE YOU'RE NO LONGER MAKING NEW SPIRM AND IN FACT THE LONGER YOU'RE ON TESTANSTEROWN THE HARDER IT MAY BE TO GET SPRM PRODUCTION TO COME BACK AND IN TWENTY FIVE PERCEN OF PEOPLE THEY MAY NOT GET IT BACK IF THEY'VE BEEN ON PROLONGED TO SAUCER AN EXPOSURE SO IT'S REALLY BECAUSE OF WHAT WOMEN WILL SOMETIMES SAY IS UNFAIR WHICH IS THE FACT THAT YOU'RE BORN WITH ALL THESE EGS AN YOU RUN OUT OF EM THEY ACCUMULATE THE WEARE AND TERR OF YOUR LIFE RIGHT WE SEE IDQUALITY BEING A HUGE ISSUE AND FEMALE REPRODUCTION YET MEN GET TO HAVE NEW SPIRM EVERY NINETY DAYS THEY GET TO WASH AWAY WHATEVER BAD GEEDS THEY DID AND CAN CHANGE THEIR LIFE STELL IN THEIR EXPOSURES AND HAVE VERY DIFFERENT SPIRM BUT BECAUSE OF THAT SAME PROMISUS THINGS THAT SHUT OFF THE PRODUCTION OF EFFASAGE ELL AGE REALLY IMPACT SPIRM QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY MENTION BAD DEEDS AM FORSPERM AH NOT BISEPERN I SAID HORSPERM AH IN IN A WEEK WE KNOW THAT HEAT IS IS I YOU PRETRAMATIC INSULT TO THE EM TO THES SPRAMATIC GENIS O CYCLE A SONIS AN HOTTUBS AND WAT NOT A I DID RECEIVE THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT AM HEAT EXPOSURE SONAS HOTTUBS CETERA ARE THEY A DETRIMENTAL TO OBULATION OR A PRODUCTION IN ANY WAY I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THINGS OR MORE INTERNAL IN FEMALES THE OVERS ARE INTERNAL BUT T'ERE ANY EVIDENCE FOR THAT I MEAN THE BODY DOES HEAT UP THE OTHERS N IT DOESN'T HARM THE OBULATORY PERIOD OF THE OVERIES AND JUST LIKE WE KNOW THE REASON WHY THE TUSTIES ARE SO SUSCEPTIBLE IS BECAUSE THEIRE SUPOSE TO BE AT A COOLER TEMPERATURE THAT'S WHY THEY'REIN THE SCROTOM OUTSIDE THE BODY THAT'S WHY THE TUSTIS ARE SO SUSCEPTIBLE TO HEAT CHANGES BUT THE OVERIES BEING INSIDE THE BODY THEY'RE NOT IN THE SAME WAY NOW WHEN SOMEBODY'S PREGNANT IMPORTANT DISTINCTION RIGHT WE KNOW THAT THE DEVELOPMEN ESPECIALLY ORGAN DEVELOPMAN OF AN EMBRYO CAN BE MORE SENSITIVE TO CERTAIN THINGS AND THAT HEAT EXPOSURE AT THAT TIME WHETHER IT'S HOT TUBEUS ARE EXTREME FEVERS EVEN CA AN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN DEVELOPMENT OF A FIDES BUT OMENT'S COMING TO THE OPULATORY CYCLE OR HORMON PRODUCTION AN HEAT IN THE FEMALE DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE I WONTO BE CLEAR BEFORE ASKS THE NEXT QUESTION THAT I DON'T WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY UN WANTED PREGNANCIES BUT WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL THEY TOLD US THAT WOMEN CAN GET PREGNANT EVEN WHILE THEY HAVE THEIR PERIOD IS THAT TRUE SEEMS LIKE A LIVE BASED ON EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING BUT I DON'T WANT ANY ONE TO RUN OUT AND A TEST THAT HYPOTHESIS WITHOUT HAVING THE FACTS FIRST SO IN GENERAL IF SOMEBODY HAS EXTREMELY REGULAR CYCLES THEN THAT'S A COMPLETE LIT YOU CAN'T GET PREGNANT ON YOUR PERIOD THE REASON WHY THEY TELL US THUS IS ONE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR YOUNGER YOUR PERIOD CYCLES TEND TO BE IRREGULAR THE'RE NOT YOUR BODY HASN'T FULLY MATURE TO HAVE THAT REGULARITY AND THAT WE KNOW THAT SPIRM DO LIVE IND THE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT FOR MUCH LONGER THAN THE AGDUS A SPIRM CAN LIVE THERE FOR UP TO FIVE DAYS SO IF SOMEBODY DID HAVE A SHORTER PERIOD WINDOW LET SAY THEIR NORMAL PERIODS ARE GOING TO BE TWENTY FOUR DAYS THEY'RE OBULATING ON CYCLE DAY TEN IF THEY HAVE A REGULAR PERIOD THAT'S FIVE OR SIX DAYS THEY COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE INTERCOURSE THAT IN PART OF THAT PERIOD THE SPIRM COULD LIVE FOR FIVE DAYS AND BE RIGHT THERE WHEN YOU HAVE THE AG IN ROUTE SO IT'S NOT THE MOST FERTILE TIME FOR SHOWER AND IN MOST PEOPLE THAT IS CONSIDERED A TIME WHEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET PREGNENT BUT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR YOUNGER AND YU HAVE MORE IRREGULARITY OR IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE A SHORT CYCLE WINDOW THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE CASE SO BY EXTENSION UM CAN WE CONCLUDE THEN AT THE MOST FERTILE TIME IS GOING TO BE WHEN SPERM MEET AGLET'S THE SAVE TIMING OF INTERCOURSE FOR YEP FOR THE TIME BEING BUT AS THEIRE'S CAN BE A DELAY THERE A WHEN SPER MEETS A EM ON OBVIOUSLY DAY OF OVULATION OR DAY A DAY AFTER THEY VE DAY OF THE EGL IS FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS SO THE EGG CAN ONLY BE FERTILIZED FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS WHILE IT'S IN THE PHILOPIAN TO ONCE THE EGG HAS ENTERED THE UTERES IT CAN'T BE FERTILIZED ANY MORE SO IT HAS THIS VERY SHORT WINDOW OF TIME WHERE IT WILL ALLOW SPERM TO ENTER IT NOW SPERM CAN LIFE FOR FIVE DAYS SO WE'LL SAY THE FERTILE WINDOW IS THIS FIVE DAY PERIOD ENDING ON THE DAY OF OPULATION YOU WILL HEAR LOT OF US A LOT OF DOCTORS SAY THE DAY AFTER OPULATION BECAUSE DEREALLY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TIME YOU OPULATED ON AND IF THE EGG HAS TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEN THAT EXTRA DAY COULD POTENTIALLY BE HELPFUL BUT REALLY IT'S FIVE DAYS ENDING ON THE DAY OF OPULATION AND PEOPLE WITH VERY REGULAR CYCLES OR WHO CONTRACT THEM AND THEY KNOW WHEN THAT OPULATION IS HAPPENING THE DAY BEFORE AND THE DAY OF OPULATION THOSE THE TWO TOP HEADING DAYS OF YOUR KIND OF NOT IN THE MOOD TO HAVE LOTS OF SECS THOSE ARE GOING TO BE THE DAYS YOU TARGET TO HAVE THE HIGHEST CHANCE OF CONCEIVING AND WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ESTRGIN LIBIDO AND OVULATION AND FEMALES THE HIGHER YOUR ESTERGEN IS THE INCREASE LIBITA THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AND OF COURSE YOU SEE THOSE PEAK ESTERGAN LEVELS WHICH ARE GOING TO TRIGGER THAT ELAGE SERGE SO THE BODY IS MADE TO GET PREGNANT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT PEAK ESTERG IN THAT PEK LIBITO RIGHT BEFORE AND RIGHT AT THAT OPULATORY TIME PERIODS SO THAT HOPEFULLY YOU ALSO WANT TO HAVE INTERCOURSE AND GET PREGNENT I'VE HEARD BEFORE LESS TO SAY THAT SOME PEOPLE TOBE CAREFUL HERE OH A CONSENTS THE LITERALLY THE DEPLOYMENT OF OF THE EGG YET THE OPULATION THEY THEY REPORT THAT THEY CAN FEEL Y THAT THIS LESS TOU SAY THATHE DEPARTURE OF THE OF THE  EGG UM IS THAT AN IMAGINARY THING O ON THAT  MAY IWE I ALWAYS LIKE I ALWAYS LIKE THAT IMAGE THAT PEOPLE CA KNOW WHEN THAT HAPPEN IT'S SO REALTHAT I M NO Y ONL MEN GENERALLY KNOW WHEN WHEN THE'RE UM WHEN THERE SPERMER ARE LEAVING THEIR BODY LET'S HOPE THEY DO UM BUT UM WHY WOULDN'T THAT THERE BE INTERNAL SENSE FOR FOR WOMEN ALSO OF WHAT'S GOING ON MAY WE HAVE INTERRECEPTION THERE'S A TON OF NERVE INNURVATION OF THAT AREA DOES NOT COMMUNICATE TO THE BRAIN EXCELLENT AS FAR AS TRACKING TO WHERE THAT SENSATION IS BUT YOU'RE RIGHT IRADY SAID OVULATION IS THE RUPTURE OF A SIST RIGHT IT IS RUPTURING AND THE IGAS BEING RELEASED AND THOSE FALICULAR FLUID IS ALSO EXITING AND GOING INTO THE PARITINIAL CAVITY AND SO THERE IS A GROUP OF WOMEN WHO CAN FEEL THAT ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE VERYIN TUNE WITH THEIR BODY AND HAS A NAME ITS CALLED MIDDLESHMIRTS THE PAIN IS ALMOST FEEL LIKE A CRAMPY PAIN THAT HAPPENS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CYCLE AND THAT IS YOUR OVULATORY PAIN HOW INTERESTING WHAT IS IT CALLED MIDDLESHMIRTS OCAT WILL PUT THEN THE SHOW NOT YOU HAPTIONS AND WHOEVER DOES IS CAN HAVE TOS AN  THE SPELLING RIGHT AN WHMIRTS AMAZING AMAZING UM AMAZING AND FOREIGN TO ME BUT FOR OBVIOUS REASON TO BUT AMAZING A AM ALWAYS ASTONISHED IN A HOW INCREDIBLY WELL ORCHESTRATED THIS WHOLE PROCESSIS IT'S ISSUSSUSSISTON INCREDIBLE FEAT OF BIOLOGY TIS I MEN THE NUMBER OF THINGS THIT HAVE TO BE TIMED CORRECTLY IN THE USE IN UNLESS HE REUSED BUT THE THE REPURPOSING OF TISSUES FOR DIFFERENT THINGS A LIKE IT WHAT IT WHAT AN INCREDIBLE DANCE AT'S JUST AMAZIFUL I MEAN IAM SO NURTY BECAUSE I JUST LOVE HOW EVERYTHING HAVE TO COMMUNICATE JUST PERFECTLY IT MAKES YOU AN AWE OF AL THE PREGNANCIES THAT JUST HAPPEN JUST ALL THE TIME BECAUSE REALLY THINGS HAVE TO SINCKRANIZE REALLY AT THE WONDERFUL TIME PERIOD AND EVEN THSE SISM HO WERE TALKING ABOUT I HEARD YOU SAY THAT O I WHEN I SAY THIS PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK EVERY SINGLE DAY WELL HOW MUCH SEX SHOULD YOU HAVE WHEN SHOULD YOU HAVE SEX AS THERE TOO MUCH SEX AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD NOT DECREASE YOUR SEXUAL INTERCOURSE INTERVALE SO IF YOU ARE IN A RELATIONSHIP AND YOU ARE SEX EVERYDAY PEOPLE HALV SEX EVERY DAY YOU WILL A HUNDRED PER CENT HIT INTERCOURSE THROUGHOUT YOUR ENTIRE FORTAL WINDOW ON THE DAY THAT YOU OBULATE YOU'RE DEPOSITING THE SAME SPIRM THERE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GENERATING NEW SPIRM IS WHETHER THE LOAD WENT HALF AND HALF AND HALF AND HALF OR IF IT WENT AN YOU KNOW ONE BIG GROUP BUT IF YOU'RE PONSTANTLY PUTTING MORE SPIRM OUT THERE YOU HAVE A HIGHER CHANCE AND SO STUDIES GO BACK AND ALWAYS SAY DAILY INEREQUIRES AS TO SAY WIT THE HIGHEST CHANCE A FECUNDABILITY ESPECIALLY DERING THE FERTILE WINDOW HOWEVER FOR COUPLES WHO ARE NOT SEX EVERYDAY PEOPLE THAT IDEA CAN CAUSE A LOT OF STRESS STRESS OF COURSE IMPACTS THE SYSTEM IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS IT CAN ALSO CAUST SEXUAL BURNOUT WHERE THEY NO LONGER FEEL LIKE BEING AN TO MEN ARE HAVING SECTS ON THE DAY THEY'RE ACTUALLY OPULATING BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN DOING AT THIS WHOLE TIME LEADING UP AND TOT'S WHERE THE TIME PERIOD SAYING HALF SEX EVERY OTHER DAY THROUGHOUT THE FERTILE WINDOW SO STARTING FIVE OR SIX DAYS BEFORE YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO OVULATE AND IN TRY TO TARGET HAVING INTERCOURSE ON THE DAY BEFORE AND THE DAY OF OPULATION AND THE REASON WHY PEOPLE SAID EVERY OTHER DAY OR A FEW DAYS PRIOR CAN HAVE GET SOME SPIRM EXPOSURE THERE IN CASE YOU OPULATED EARLY BUT REALLY TO TRY TO PREVENT SOME OF THAT INCREASED STRESS THAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO CONCEIVE ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE PROGRAMMED OR TIMED INTERCOURSE THAT NEEDS TO HAPEN ON AN EVERYDAY INTERVAL BUT THE ODDS OF GETTING PRAGNANT BY SAVING UP SPIRM FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS THAT'S NOT HIGHER CURISON WHY IF WA TU AY HAVPATHETICALLY SOME ONE IS UM DON'T ATING OR FREEZING SPERM ARE DOING AEF WHY THEY INSTRUCT THE MAIL TO I'M NOT EJACULATE FOR FORTY EIGHT TO SEVENTY TWO HOURS PRIOR TO UM LET YOU SAY DEPOSITING SPIRM IS SUCH A FUNNY WORD IS BUT THEY WORKS SO TWO POINTS ONE IF WE'RE DOING A SEAM AN ANALYSIS NOW WE'RE TRYING TO EVALUATE THIS SPIRM AND IN ITS HEST HAS CERTAIN NORMAL PERAMETERS AND THESE ARE ALL BASED ON A FORTY EIGHT TO SEVENTY TWO HOUR ABSTINENCE PERIOD SO YES IF YOU AJ ACULATE MORE FREQUENTLY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE LESS SPERM AND THAT TO BE VERY NORMAL BUT IF WE'RE LOOKING AT A TESTS WIT SET NORMAL PERAMETERS THAT ARE BASED ON TWO TO THREE DAYS OF NOT HAVING INTERCOURSE THAT'S WHAT WE WANT YOU TO DO IT FOR THAT IF WE'RE DOING LET'S SAY I I OR INTRIBUTERN INSEMINATION ALSO KNOWN AS ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION OR WHERE WE TAKE THE SPERM AND PUT IT IN A CASS THAT ARE AND PUT IT IN THE UTERES WE'RE TRYING TO GET MORE PLAYERS FORTHET ON THE FIELD AND IN THAT CASE I KNOW WHEN YOU OVULATE BECAUSE I'M TIMING IT PERFECTLY AND I AM TRYING TO GET AS MANY POSSIBLE IN THIS PROCESS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT JUST HAVING THEM DEPOSITED AN THE VIGINA WE'RE TRYNG TO GET HIM FURTHER SO WE WANT MORE BECAUSE THAT'S PART OF THAT TREATMENT PROCESS AND SIMILARLY WITH IVEFF I WONT TO HAVE AS MANY SPIRM AS POSSIBLE TO SORT THROUGH AND PICK OUT THE BEST LOOKING THE MOST MOTIL THE MOST NORMALLY SHAPED ONES SO WE'RE TRYING TO GET JUST A BETTER SAMPLE AND BY HAVING THESE NORMAL GUIDELINES WERE ABLE TO JUDGE THIS IS LOW FOR WHAT IT SHOULD BE WHICH CAN ALSO BE A CLUE TO OTHER PROBLEMS IT IF WE WON'T TALK ABOUT CHEMISTRY BOTH THEM SO INTERPERSONAL CHEMISTRY AND LITERALLY A EJACULATE AND VAGIONAL CHEMISTRYT BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT UM I'M CURIOUS WHETHER NOT WE CAN JUST TOUCH ON A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WONDER ABOUT IN TERMS OF EGG QUALITY AND IF THEY TOUCH ON SPIRM QUALITY MAYBE WE CAN ALSO JUST MENTION THAT UM BUT FOR INSTANCE UM DOES CANABUS EITHER BY EDIBLE OR BY SMOKING CANABUS IMPACT A QUALITY INEITHER DIRECTION ALCOHOL WOULD BE THE NEXT AND THEN I'M GOING TO ASSUME AND I HAVE TO DO THIS IT STRICTLY BECAUSE OF WHAT I UNDERSTAND ABOUT YOU KNOW DRUGS OF A BEUSTS LIKE COKANE AND EMPHEDEMING METHEMPEDEMING THAT NONE OF THOSE CAN BE GOOD FOR SYSTEMS OF THE BODY BECUSE THEY PROVIDES THEY CREATE SO MUCH STRESS FOR THE BODY U BUT THIS IS A ALCOHOL IN CANABUS UM I READISTATISTIC WHEN RESEARCHING EPISODE ON C ANABUS THAT SHOCKED ME WHICH IS THAT FIFTEEN PER CENT ONE FIVE PER CENT NOT ONE POINT FIVE FIFTEEN PER CENT OF AMERICAN WOMEN AT LEAST IN THIS ONE STUDY SURVEY REPORTED HAVING CONSUMED OR SMOTE CANABUS DURING KNOWN PREGNANCY WHICH IS WY OR WILD UNLESS OF COURSE I'M JUST NAIVE AND TCS NOT HARMFUL O FEED US BUT I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING THAT SO WHAT GIVES I MEAN HER TO  ND THERE I ASHU JUS THRON FEEDLE THE BANDMENT SO IS CANABUS IS I'LLI'LL CALL BAD FOR A QUALITY SO THERE DIFFERENT THINGS INDE THE SAME THING IN ONE SO LES ANSWER THEM WEACH INDIVIDUALLY SO WE'LL GO WITH THE ONE THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS AND HAS ACCEPTED NOW THAT THEY WOULDN'T AVE ACCEPTED FORTY YEARS GAT RIGHT SMOKING CIGARETTES SO THAT'S OBVIOUSLY BAD DECREASES THE NUMBER OF EGGS YOU HAVE IN THE VAULT SMOKING CIGARETTES ACTUALLY GUESSNTO YOUR VAULT DECREASES THE NUMBER THAT YOU HAVE YOAVE A HIGHER CHANCE OF GOING INTO MENAPOS EARLY AR AND IT INCREASES THE RISK OF HAVING ABNORMAL CREMASOMS WHICH IS WHAT WE REALLY THINK ABOUT WE THINK ABOUT EG QUALITY RIGHT AND PACTINE THOSE MY ATTIC SPINDLES INSIDE THE EGGS WHICH HOLD THE CROMAZONES AND THEIR PERFECT POSISION THEY ARE ASSOCIATED THEY GET WEARIN TAR FROM THINGS THAT CAUSE INFLAMMATION OR AR TOXIC SOYS CIGARETTE SMOKE WE KNO DECREASES AT QUALITY A QUANTITY INCREASES MISCARRIAGE AND TH OF CHORS HAS FEEDLE AND PACKS COULD I JUST AS YOU AD I WION WE TELG ABOUT AM THERE'S NICATINE WHICH ITSELF IS NOT CARSON JENICAN THEN THERE'S THE SMOKING PROCESS WHICH BRINGS IN A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS THE THE QUESTION I KNOW IS BURNING IN EVERYBODY'S MINE IS VAPING YET LET MI BECAUSE VAPING IS I'M I'M VERY BULLISH ON THISON MATES VERY CLEAR THAT THE CHEMICALS ASSOCIATE WITH APING ARE JUST OH SO BAD FOR EVERYBODY'S HEALTH BUT IT'S DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT FROM SAYING THAT NICOTINE IS BAD AT FOR ONE'S HEALTH AND IT CAN BE BUT UM WITHOUT DOING TOO MUCH OF A DEEP DIVE IS ARE THERE ANY DATA THAT SHOW THAT VAPING IS BAD FOR E QUAL LITY OF COURSE THERE'S NOT AS MUCH DATA BECAUSE IT JUST HASN'T BEEN AROUND AS LONG BUT YES VAPING DEFFLING AS CHEMICALS THAT LOOKS LIKE ITS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR SUCCESSORATES AND IVY OF CYCLES AND THAT'S REALLY CRONE OF ONE OF THE MOST FINITE MEASURES OF AT QUALITY WE CAN SEE BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY TESTING THE AG AT A LEVEL AND A LAB VERSES JUST ARE YOU GETTING PREGNANT NATURALLY AND S ART INTROJECT AGAIN BUT ANY TIME OF CONVERSATION LIKE THIS COMES OFF ESPECIALLY BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE IN THE HEALTH SCIENCE SPACE UM THEREARE THESE SHOUTS BECAUSE I HEAR THEM IT LITERALLY WERE PEOPLE SAY WELL LISTEN I VAPE O EVERY DAY AND I'VE HAD THREE HEALTHY BABIES AND I THINK A MY RESPONSE IS ALWAYS  KANE THERE'S CAN BE A DISTRIBUTION OF RESPONSES AND THEN OF COURSE HOW MUCH HEALTHIER COULD YOUR BABIES HAVE A BEEN HAD YOU NOT VAPE DURING PREGNANCY WERE VAPED PRIOR TOPREDENCS YOU I AND I THINK THESE ARE THAT THE KEY ISSUES THAT LIKE YOU CAN'T YOU CANT REWINE THE CLOCK AS FAR AS I KNOW RIGHTN IN THE OBSENCE OF THE TIME MACHINE YOU CAN'T REWIND THE CLOCK SO UM IT M BASILY EVERYTHNG YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT SMOKING CIGARETTES WERE VAPING NICOTINE JUST CAN'T BE GOOD FOR A ON'T KO YAT WE KNOW THAT IT'S NOT GOOD FOR GETTING PREGNAT WE KNOW THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR SPIRM AND THEREFORE WE ALSO KN WAS GOING TO IMPACT PREGNANCY RADS YOU THINGS LIKE CANABATS RIGHT DECREASES FIRM PRODUCTION DECREASES FIRM MOTILITY CHANGES FORM MORPHOLOGY THE SHAPE AF IT CHANGES THE DIONA IT INCREASES THE FRAGMENTATION OF THE DEONA IF YOURE PARTNER YUSES CANABAS AND YOU GET PREGNAT YOU HAVE A HIGHER CHANCE OF MISCARRIAGE BECAUSE OF THESE SFIRM ASSOCIATION WITH THE CANABATS NOW ADABLE CANABUS I O NO AS YOU CAUSE YOU CAN'T STUDY SOMETHING THAT'S ILLEGAL SO A LOT OF THIS DATA IS JUST MORN NEW AND A LOT OF ITS GOING TO BE OBSERVATIONAL AND IN STATES LIKE COLORADO IN CALIFORNIA WERE YOU KNOW CAMMISIS ESSENTIALLY LEGAL UM YEM A A'M ASSUMING THAT THERRE MORE DATA BUT O CASE SO UM SMOKING AND OR VAPING NICOTING CANABUS ITHER ETABLE OR SMOKED VERY LIKELY DETRIMENTAL TO E QUALITY AND SPIRM QUALITY WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT ONE CAN CONCEIVE IT SIMES TAT THE QUALITY OF YOUR BABY TYE YOUR CHILD WILL NOT BE AS HIGH AS THE QUALITY OF THAT BABY IF YOU DIDN'T DO THAT AND IS ATRIGHT YES ANDAR NOT EVMU Y TO DUMANIZE ANY ONE THAT DID DID DO THIS DURING PREGNANCY LOD PEOPLE DODN'T KNOW BUT IF THIS IS THIS S REALLY ABOUT PEOPLE TRY TO MAKE CHOICES IN ANTICIPATION OF FUTURE PREGNANCY YE AND WHEN YOUARE TRYING TO SET YOURSELF UP FOR SUCCESS BECAUSE WE KNOW AND FERTILITIES BECOMING MORE COMMON WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHO IS GOING TO HAVE IT AND WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF IN THAT POSITION SPECIFICALLY YOU KNOW ONE T OPTIMIZE EVERYTHING YOU CAN SO IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO MAKE THESE FIRM QUALITY WORSE AND THE EGQUALITY WORSE AND YOUR SUCCESS WITH TREATMENT LOWER AND YOUR MISCARRIAGERAT HIGHER WE'RE GOING TO RECOMMEND THAT YOU NOT DO IT IF YOUR TRYING TO GET PREGNANT NATURALLY ALL THESE THINGS CORRELATE OVER BUT OF COURSE THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE AUTLIERS IN EXCEPTIONS I'M GOING TO SIT HERE AND TELL YOU THAT THE ODSOGETTING PREGNANT AT AGE FORTY THREE ARE LESS THAN THREE PER CENT PER MONTH AND EVERY SINGLE PERSONS CAN BE LIKE BUT MY AUNT BARBARA OR I KNOW THIS PERSON WHO DID BECAUSE THREE PERCENTS NOTS EROU AND YOUR SHORMET NATURAL A BRENASSIAER BIND BY A HAVE AN INTERGUAL FASHION WAY K RIGHT BUT YES SO PEOPLE WILL GET PREGNANT PEOPLE WILL HAVE HEALTHY CHILDREN WHO DO HAVE EXPOSURES TO NECATINE TO CANNABUTS EVEN TO ALCOHOLL EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW THAT ALCHOLL CAN CAUSE FEEDAL ALCOHOLL CENDRAM ZERO PERCENT OF ALCHOLL SHOULD BE THE ACCEPTABLE LEVEL AND PREGNANCY AND THEN DOES ALCOHOL IN PACT FERTILITY SUCH A COMPLICATED QUESTION ND THIS IS PROBABLY DUE TO THE AMOUNT YOU CONSUME IN THE FREQUENCY OF WHAT YOU CONSUME IT ALCOHOLL IS A TOXIN THAT YOUR LEVER MUST FILTER OUT AND WE KNOW IT CAUSES INFLAMMATION ANYBODY WHO'S HAD A FINNIGTE WITH ALCOHOLL KNOSE THEY CAN WAKE UP THE NEXT DAY AND THEY FEEL DIFFERENT THEIR BODY IS PROCESSING THAT ALCOHOL AND THAT INFLAMMATION ESPECIALLY F IT'S CHRONIC CHRONIC EXPOSURE WE KNOW CHRONIC INFLAMMATION IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SEE IMPACTING AT QUALITY IN SPARMPOLITY SOY CERTAINLY IF YOU ENJOY OUNCAUL IS SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IS DONE IN MODERATION ONE OR TWO DRINKS A WEEK AT THE MOIST AND YOU SHOULD NOT DO IT AT ALL WHENCE YOU FIND OUT YOUR PAGNANT I LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND THINK OUR SPONS AR INSIDE TRACKER INSIDE TRACKERS A PERSONALIZED NUTRICIAN PLATFORM THET ANALYZES DATA FROM YOUR BLOOD ENDIANE TO HELP YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR BODY AND HELP YOU REACH YOUR HEALTH GOALS I'VE LONG BED OF BELIEVER IN GETTING REGULAR BLOOD WORK DONE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT MANY OF THE FACTORS THAT IMPACT YOUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURM HEALTH CAN ONLY BE ASSESSED WITH A QUALITY BLOOD TESTS THE PROBLEM WITH A LOT OF BLOOD INDIANATES OUT THERE HOWEVER IS THAT THEY'LL GIVE YOU INFORMATION ABOUT CERTAIN LIPID MARKERS OR HORMONE MARKERS BUT NO INFORMATION BOUT WHAT TO DO WITH ALL OF THAT DATA INSIDE TRACKER MAKES IT VERY EASY TO LOOK AT YOUR LEVELS OF HORMONES METABOLIC FACTORS LIPPIDS ET CETERA AND THEN TO ASSESS WHAT SORTS OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRICIONAL SUPPLEMENTATION OR PERHAPS OTHER INTERVENTIONS YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE IN ORDER TO BRING THOSE NUMBERS INTO THE RANGES THAT ARE OPTIMO FOR YOUR HEALTH INSIDE TRACERS ULTIMATE PLAN NOW INCLUDES THREE NEW HORMONE MARKERS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO MEASURE DURING A WOMAN'S REPRODUCTIVE AND MENAPOZL YEARS THESE ARE ESTRA DIAL PROJESTERONE AND THIROID STIMULATING HORMONE IF YOU LIKE TO TRY INSIDE TRACKER YOU CAN GO TO INSIDE TRACKER DOT CAM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF ANY OF INSIDE TRACKERS PLANS AGAIN THAT INSIDE TRACKER DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BIRT CONTROL I FORTUNATELY MOVED US FORWARD AND AND FORGOT TO ASK ABOUT A U D SOY OW SO A MINOR SCHANGE TO THE COPPERA UD WORKS BY CREATING A SORT OF EM NOT ACTUALLY ELECTRIC BUT A KIND OF A ELECTRIC E FENCE THAT KILLS SPURN FROM DON'T LET NO YA ON THAT LINT COPPER COPPER LIKES TO KILLSPURN EM THERE'S SOME INTERESTING A HISTORY HAVE BEEN READING ALON THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE OF EM PEOPLE WHO OU KNOW FOR WHATEVER REASON WERE FORCED INTO OR CHOSE TO BE IN THE SEXTRATE  THE PROSTITUTES UTING A INSERTING COPPER QOINS INTO THEIR VAGIONAL TRACT TO TRYING A KILL CERM BUT TO VERYING DEGREES OF SUCCESS OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A WHOLE A SUCY ECONOMIC LANDSCAPE AROUND THAT SO AM THINK IT'S OBVIOUS WIT AN REFERRING TO BUT AM VERY INTERESTING BUT THAT'S JUST ONE FORM OF AUDYA RITE THE THE'R SOME OTHER THER IUDIES AND THEN THERE'S COURSE THE RING WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THAT S MAY WE JUST TOUCH ON A FEW OF THOSE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF WHEATHER NOT IT BALTERS A QUALITY END OR FUTURE FERTILITY WHEN ONE TAKES THE RING OUT TAKES THE IUDY OUT THIS IS A GREAT QUESTION BECAUSE A LOT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS AND AN ALL ROL THROUGH A FEW OF THE TOPPERS CONTROL MATHEADS AND JUST THINKING THROUGH COPPER AUY AS YOU AR DESIDE NO HORMONAL INVOLVEMENT ITS CAUSES INFLAMMATION AND A TOXIC ENVIRONMENT INSIDE THE UTEROUS ISOLATED DOES CAUSE SOMETIMES HEAVIER PERIODS BUT THEY SHOULD STILL BE REGULAR IF THEY ARE IRREGULAR THAT'S A SIGN OF A HORMONAL ISSUE BECAUSE YOU STILL ODULATE WITH THE COPPER IDY IS IT LITERALLY A COPPER WIRE WOVEN IN YEERS I A IT THE LIUDYAS IS A LITTLE TEA AND THE ARMS AR HAVE COPPER WIRES WRAPPED AROUND THEM AND IN THOSE ARE THEY GROW INTO THE UTERIN LININ THEYN' GROW INTO THE UTERN LINING AUDY JUST SITS IN THERE AND JUST THE PRESENCE OF THAT COPPER CAUSES THAT INFLAMENTORY REACTION IN THAT TOXIC ENVRONMENT AND IS IT TOKIC TO THE ENVIRONMENT IN WAYS THAT ARE DETRIMENTAL TO THE WOMAN OR JUST A SPIRM BOTH I MEAN INPLANTATION AS NOT GOING TO OCCUR LIKELY WRITING NO NOTHING AS A HUNDRED PER CENT SUCCESSFUL BUT IT'S MUCH HARDER FOR N EMBRYAST IMPLANT WITHIN THAT HIGHLY INFLAMETORY ENVIRONMENT TO ME AMAZING THAT PEOPLE FIGURE THIS OUT BEFORE ITS ASANYNONE LABORATORIES RAY LES THIS PUT SOME COPPER IN TE MUTERUSES AND SEE WHAT HAPPEN  YOU KNOW IT IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE THE URGENCY THAT MUST HAVE EXISTED TO PREVENTING PREGNANCY AND THEY JUST HOW COSTLY BIOLOGICALLY AND THE PREGNANCY IS ON EALY PREGNANCY  PREGNANCY'S NOT HEALTH AN NEUTRAL SO IT IS SOMETHING TOT SOMEBODYIES NEEDS TO BE IN A F RIGHT HOWTHER IT CAN BE A DEADLY CIRCUMSTANCE WHEN WE GET BACK TO OTHER IUDES SO IUDES THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE MORE FAMILIAR WITH ARE THE PROJSTORON BASE IUDES THIS IS GOING TO BE OUR MORENA CHILINA LILETTA THEY'VE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT NAMES BASE ON THE AMOUNT OF PROJESTORON AND HOW LONG THEY LAST FOR THESE WORK MOSTLY BY THINNING OUT THE UTER AN LINING AS WE AREADY SAID PROJEST OR OWN COMPAC THE UTER AN LINING TO PREPARE IT FOR IMPLANTATION AN ENORMAL PCYCLE BUT IF YOU HAVE CONSTANT EXPOSURE TO PROJEST OR OWN WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IT ITS GOING TO PREVENT THE UTER IN LINING FROM GROWING AND IT GETS IT VERY VERY FEN NOT ALL IUDES IN FACT MOST OF THEM DON'T PREVENT OPULATION ONLY IN ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE DO TEY ACTUALLY PREVENT OBULATION SO THEIR MAIN MECHANISM OF ACTION IS THIS INDEMETRIO AF FACT WHEN YOU REMOVE THE IUDE ESPECIALLY IF YOU ALREADY OBULATING NO PROBLEM THE PROBLEM WE DUCY IN SOME PEOPLE WITH PROGESTOR AN IUDES THAT MAYBE ISN'T TALKED ABOUT AS MUCH IS THAT THIS PROLONGED PROGESTOR AN EXPOSURE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE PUTTING IUDESN FOR FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS AND NOT HAVING A PERIOD FOR THAT LENGTH OF TIME BECAUSE THE INDEMETRIUM HAS BECOME SO A TROPHIC OR NONEXISTENT THAT YOU'RE NO LONGER BLEEDING DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU MAY BE OBULATING IT CAN TAKE A WHILE FOR THAT LINING TO GROW BACK AND SO IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE AN IUDEAN PLACE AND IF YOU HAVE NO PERIOD YOUR GOING TO SAY THIS IS GREAT I DON'T HAVE A PERIOD WONDERFUL YOU GET IT REMOVED AND NOW YOUR PERIOD HASN'T COME BACK AND THAT LEADS PEOPLE TO SOMETIMES BECONCERNED THAT THE IUDES CAUSING THEM NOT TO OBULATOR THEY HAVE THIS IN FERTILITY CAUSED BY THE IUDE BUT REALLY WHAT IT IS IS THAT THE LININGS BECOME SO SO THEN THAT IT CAN TAKE MANY MONTHS OF THAT UNOPPOSED ESTOREDAN EXPOSURE IN THE FULLICULAR PHASE TO GET IT THICK ENOUGH TO FINELY BLEED WHEN YOU'RE OBULATING SO I DO TELL PEOPLE F THEY HAVE A PROGESTERON IU TO GET IT REMOVED THREE TO SIX MONTHS BEFORE THEY WANT TO GET PRAGNAT YOU SOME OTHER FORM OF CONTRACEPTION BUT GIVE THEIR BODY TIME TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THAT REGULAR PERIOD PATTERN BACK IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IF YOUR STILL ODULATING AND HAVING A PERIOD ON AN IUD THEN THIS IS GOING TO BE LESS OF A CONCERN BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GROWING IN ENOUGH OF A LINING TO THEN SHET IT WE'RE LESS WORRIED ABOUT IT BUT IF YOU ARE AIM IN A REIC OR HAVE ABSENCE OFYOUR PERIODS WITH AN IUD WE NEED O THINK ABOUT REMOVING IT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE YOU GET PREGNAT SO THAT YOUR BODY CAN GROW THAT LINING AGAIN WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU MENTIONED ONE AT YOU DENOUNCE THAT I WANT TO MENTION IS THE DEPO PREVER SHOT THE DEPIL PREVERE SHOT IS A HIDOSE OF PRODUSTORON HIGH ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY PREVENT OPULATION SO IN THAT CIRCUMSTANTS YOU ARE NOT ODULATING AND THEREFORE IF YOU DON'T OPULATE YO'RE NOT GOING TO GET PRAGNANT DEBIL PREVERES PROVEN TO PREVENT OBULATION FOR THREE MONTHS SO WHEN YOU TAKE IT YOU NEED TO GET IT EVERY THREE MONTHS TO HAVE A PROVEN CONTRACEPTIVE BENEFIT HOWEVER IT CAN LASTIN YOUR SYSTEM FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND PREVENT OVULATION FOR UP TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS SO I WILL SEE PEOPLE WHO LIKED THAT OPTION FOR CONTRACEPTION AND NOW THEY HAVEN'T HAD A PERIOD A LONG TIME BUT THEIR LAST DEPO SHOT WAS SIX MONTHS AGO AND THERE ALL FRUSTRATE IT BY THE FACT WHEN I TELL THEM WILL YOU STILL MAY NOT HAVE ANOTHER PERIOD FOR A YEAR PLUS BECAUSE THIS HIGH LEVEL OF PRODESTERON THAT YOU'VE ARDY INJECTED INTO YOUR SYSTEM CAN LAST A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TIME SO THAT IS A CONTRACEPTIVE OPTION THAT I TELL PEOPLE TO DISCONTINUE A YEAR AND A HALF TO TWO YEARS BEFORE THEY WANT TO GET PRAGNAT WHICH SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT YET AND SO THAT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE A CONTRACEPTIVE EPTION FOR IF YOU'RE VERY REMOTE FOR WANTING TO HAVE A CHILD BUT IN PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THEIR CHILD BEARING YEARS CONTEMPLATING FAMILY BUILDING SOON THAT IS NOT MY FAVORITE OPTION YOU HAVEN'T MENTIONED BECAUSE I HAVE BE'T ASKED AM ANY NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF BIRTH CONTROL OF ANY KIND AND I'M NOT ENCOURAGING YOU TO IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN THEM I KNOW THAT THIS OLIRARY CONTROVERSIAL A TOPIC BUT AM YOU KNOW ONE OF THE MORE POPULAR STUDIES DISCUSSED ON SOCIAL MEDIAS ONE THAT I'VE SPENT SOME TIME WITH THE PAPER M AND A FEW OF THE PAPERS THAT STEMPED FROM IT AM NOT A HUGE STUDY BUT DESCRIBING THAT HOW WOMEN RATE THE FACES OF MEN AS EITHER MORE ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAPPENS THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE AT LEAST IN THIS STUDY A THERE WAS A A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT A BIAS A FOR WOMEN TO SELECT PARTICULAR MALE FACES AS ATTRACTIVE IN THOSE MALE FACES TENDED TO BE OF THE MORE YOU KNOW SQUARE JAW AKA MASCULINE FEATURES RIGHT IN AIR QUOTES RIGHT THIR'S WHAT THE STUDY A FOUND AM BUT THAT WHEN WOMEN WERE ON ORAL CONTRACEPTION PRESUMELY ESTERGEN PROGESTIN TYPE OR CONTRACEPTION THAT THAT EFFECT A WAS SMEARED THEY HAD A NOT A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT TENDENCY TO A CHOOSE THE QUOTEN QUOTMORE MASCULINE FACE I'VE TO BE VERY CAREFUL OF MY LANGUAGE HERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S EASY TO GET DESCRIPTION OF A STUDY LIKE THIS WRONG AND THAT IS A LED A LOT OF PEOPLE TO THINK THAT BIRTH CONTROL SECEN TO THROW OFF THEIR PARTNER CHOICE A NOW OF COURSE IT IS A SMALL STUDY AM STUDIES LIKE IT ARE NOT ALWAYS SO WELL CONTROLLED AM BUT IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT BIRTH CONTROL OR ORL ESTERGEM PROJEST IN BASES BIRTH CONTROL JUST KEEP ITS SPECIFIC CAN INCREASE RATES OF CANCERS CAN DECREASE RATES OF CANCERS CAN LEAD TO AM ANY SORTS OF DESRUPTIONS IN A BODILY A FUNCTION OR HEALTH THAT'S REALLY LIKE A ROCK SOLID RESULT THAT'S BEEN SEEN BY MULTIPLE STUDIES CLINICAL TRIALS AM ERE WE STILL JUST IN THE DARK ABOUT A LOT OF THE STUFF O CASE IN NOTHING IS WITHOUT RESK GETTING PRAGMENTS NOT WITHOUT RISK TAKING THE BIRTH CONTROL PILL IS NOT WITHOUT RISKWE DO SEE HAT THE'S BEEN A LOT OF NOT INFORMED CONSENT IN PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING THE BIRTH CONTROL PELL MEANING MAYBE THEY WARN EDUCATED ABOUT WHAT ALL OF THEIR OPTIONS WERE THE POSITIVES AND THE NEGATIVES ABOUT EACH ONE OF THEM IF ORGAN A REFERENCE THE CONVE TO THE PELL ESTROGEN PRODESTRAN PELL IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT NEITHER THE ESTROGEN NOR THE PROGESTORONE ARE THE SAME ESTEROGEN PROGESTORON THAT TUR OVERIES MAKE RIT IT'S ETHONAL ESTRODIAL WHITH YOUR BRAIN INTERPRETS AS AN ESTRGEN BUT OTHER PARTS OF YOUR BODY MAY NOT AND IN ITS VARIOUS TYPES OF PROGESTENS SOME OF WHICH HAVE EVEN ANDROGENET OR MALE HORMONE LIKE PROPERTIES AND SOME OF WHICH DO NOT SO THERE'S A TON OF VARIATION EVEN THE AMOUNT OF ETHENAL ESTERODIAL THAT EACH PLL HAS WITH YOUR LOW LOW IN YOUR LOW PILLS HAVING LAST AND EVEN WITH THE MODERN DAY AVERAGE PILL HAVING A LOT LESS ESTROGAN THAN IT USED TO WHEN YOURE ON THE BIRTH CONTROL PELL YOUR OVERIES AREN'T MAKING ESTRADIAL AND THAT ESTRADIAL IS IMPORTANT IN GROWING THE UTER AN LINING BUT ALSO FOR THE GENERAL STRUCTURES AND SO WE THINK ABOUT BAGINAL HEALTH AND BOLFAR HEALTH WE CERTAINLY SEE THAT ESPECIALLY WITH CONTINUOUS USE SO IF WE DISTINGUISH YOU TAKE THE PELL FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS AND YOU HAVE A SEVEN DAY BRAK WHERE YOU MIGHT BLEED OR YOU TAKE SUGAR PILLS AND THEN YOU TAKE THEM AGAIN A LOT OF PEOPLE NOW ARE TAKING CONTINUOUSLY WHERE YOU HAVE EXPOSURED TO THESE COMPOUNDS EVERY SINGLE DAY HASO I LIKE THE THE UM THE WEAL THE L L POUCH WITH THE WEEL OF DIFFERENT COLORED PILLS UM THEY'VE SEEN THESE ON THEN CONSHOP IN PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIPS TO THE AH AND THEN THERE'S THE ONES THAT SOMETIME YOU WERE JUST OUGHT NOT TO TAKE AS THOSE OF THE NOT  WI DE BUT THE  THER SUGAR PILLS SO LIKE THAT THERE'S NO NEED TO TAKE ESTROGEN DURING THAT THASE AND THEN AN THEN THEY REPEAT IS THA TACTLY I CAD BUT SOMEPODY WERE TAKING ESTEROGEN CAN ANYMALYI RVERYCOMMONRY NOW SO PEOPLE AND THEY'RE NOT WRONG THEY SAYO WELL WHY HAVE A PERIOD IN THESE LITTLE BRAKES IT'S NOT REALLY A REFLECTION OF MY HORMONE STATUS WHICH IS ACCURATE AND SO THERE TAKING THEM CONTINUOUSLY YOU ALSO LESS PELL FAILURE PEGNANCIES SO IF YOURE USING THE PIL FOR CONTRACEPTION THAT CAN BE A GREAT STRATEGY BUT THE LONGER YOU TAKE THEM WE DO SEE SOME TVAGINABLE LAR CHANGES RIHTE IN SO A TROPHIC FAGENIT IS PEOPLE WHO NOTICE INCREASE SENSITIVITY DECREASE ELASTICITY INCREASE DISCOMFORT WITH INTERCORES INCREASE IN WITH EAST INFECTIONS THAT CAN SOMETIMES BE SE BECAUSE THAT ENVIRONMENT IS DIFFERENT NOW THATS JUST ONE THING THAT CAN COME FROM THE PILL WE ALSO SEE THE PILL BE LIFE SAVING FOR OTHER PEOPLE THEY HAVE TERRIBLE UKNO PIAMAS OR PREMINSTRUAL DISPOREC ANDRUM WHERE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH WHEN THEY CHANGE FROM HIDE A LO ESTERGON SO WAYS THE CHANGE IN ESTERGEN THAT INTERFERES CAN CAUSE SOME PEOPLE TO REALLY HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT ARE SO SEVERE THAT HAVING THAT STABLE HORMON LEVEL IS HELPFUL AND SO THE PILCAN BE EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL FOR SOME PEOPLE WHEN IT COMES TO MENTAL HEALTH IT CAN BE BENEFICIAL FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE ISSUES WITH VERY HEAVY PERIODS AN A NENIANS THAT AGETTING BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS YO TAKING THE BIRTH CONTROL PILL MIGHT PREVENT THE LINING OF THE UTERS FROM GROWING SO MUCH THAT THEY BLEED SO MUCH SAME THING WITH FIBAROIDS PEOPLE WITH PICIOS PIECIOS IS POLYCYSICAL VARIANCE ANDRUM IF WE WENT O PIT VERY SIMPLY WYOU 'VE A LOT O EGGS IN YOURVAULT SO YOU RELEASE A LOT OF EGGS EVERY MONTH AND WHAT THIS DOES IS THE EFESAGE SIGNAL GETS DELUTED AND SO YOUR NOT RESPONDING TO THE NORMAL SIGNAL AND YOU DON'T OVULATE AND BECAUSE THE OVERY IS A HORMONE MAKING FACTORY GETS REALLY BORED WHEN IT CAN'T MAKE ESTERGEN CAUSE AT EGGS NOT GROWING SO IT STARTS TO MAKE TESOSTEROM SO YOU START TO SEE THIS ANDEROGEN DOMINANT ENVIRONMENT ASSOCIATED WITH LACK OF OVULATION AND HAVING A LOT OF FOLICALS INSIDE THE OVERY THAT ARE NOT ERALY RESPONDING INTRGES IT SCUSE ME INTERAGEIZATION OF OTHER TISSUES LIKE LIKE BODY HER DANNING A VODIS AIR IT TYPICALLY THE LEVEL OF TESACTERAN MADE IN PICIOES ISN'T TRULY DEEPENING VAIS IT CAN IF THERE IS AND A VERYIN TUMOR MAKING TOSAUCERONE OR CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS BUT TYPICALLY WITH PICIOAS YOU SEE INCREASE IN BODY HAIR INCREASE IN ACNY AND YOU CAN SEE SOME EVEN LIKE MALE PATTER AN BALDING SOME TEMPORAL BALDING OF WOMEN SO SOME HAIR LOSS WHATSO AGAN IT WA A MIHT AGAIN YOU HAD THE WIDOW PEING AND THEN FINNING OUT IN THESE TWO AREAS AND THEN WE SEE AN INCREASE AND BODY COMPOSITION TOWARDS A MALE LEVEL SO F WE THINK ABOUT A MALE BODY HOLDING YOUR FAT IN YOUR ABDOMINAL REACH EN AND IF WE THINK ABOUT THE TRADITIONAL FEMALE BODY HOLDING MORE FAT IN THE HIPS AND THIGHS AREA WE SEE THAT WHEN THIS HORMON SHIFTS AND PICIOES YOU TEND TO GET MORE ADOMAN OLD FAT DISTRIBUTION WHICH THEN LEADS TO FURTHER INSLEN RESISTANCE AND MATABOLEXAN GEM BUT IN PESIO ES BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT OVULATING AND THOSE OVERIES EACH LITTLE PHOLICAL MAKES A TINY AMOUNT OF ESTERGEN WILL SAY EACH LITTLE PHOLICAL WHEN IT'S NOT RESPONDING WILL MAKE  ONE TO TWO PICAGRAMS OF ESTERGEN BUT IF YOU HAVE FIFTY OF THEM EACH MONTH YOUR HAVING SOME CONSTANT ESTERGEN EXPOSUR SO THAT LINING OF THE UTERUS IS BEING CONSTANTLY STIMULATED TO GROW AND YOUR NEVER GETTING THE PROGESTERON TO STABILIZE OR THE PROGESTROM WITHDRAW TO BLEED SO IN DEMETRIAL CANCERS MUCH HIGHER IN PEOPLE OT PICIOAS WHO DON OVULATE AND THE BIRTH CONTROL PILL CAN PREVENT THAT ANY UNOPPOSED ESTERGEN SITUATION BECAUSE THE BODY IS MADE TO HAVE BOTH ESTERGEN AND PROGESTERAM SO WE SEE AN IMMENSE DECREASE AN INDEMETRIO CANCER AN IMMENSE DROP AN AVARIAN CANCER A VARING CANCER COMES FROM THE REMODELLING OF THE OVERY SO EVERY TIME YOU'VE A FALICAL GROW AND IT RUPTURES AND IT MAKES THE CORPUS LUDIUM AND THAN IT HEALS UP THOSE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE CANCER CELLS T OU GO AWAY IN THAT REMODELLING PROCESS AND LEAD TO AVARING CANCER AND BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT OVULATING ON THE PILL YOURE INCIDENCE OF ABEARYING CANCER DROPS DRAMATICALLY TEN YEARS OF PELL USE HAS DROPPED THE CHANCE YOU GET O VARING CANCER BY MORE THAN NINETY PER CENT AND OF COURSE OF BARYING CANCER IS SUPERHARD TO DIGNOSE BECAUSE THE ENERVATION TO THE PARITSNIAL SYSTEM IS POOR AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OUTWARD SIGNS OFTEN TILL LATE STAGE DISEASE THAT BEING SAID COULD YOU POTENTIALLY HAVE AN INCREASED IN BRAST CANCER IN SOME PEOPLE BY TAKING THE PILL BY TAKING THE PELL THAT THAT'S A CONCERN ESPECIALLY IN PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE PREDISPOSED TO THIS FOR SOME OTHER REASON MIGHT HAV RECOMMUTATION THATSLLINA AND THEN IS THERE A SITUATION WHERE THE PILL CERTAINLY MASKS WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOUR MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND I REALLY THINK THIS IS WHERE WOMEN'S HEALTH HAD HAS A HUGE HISTORY AND PATERNALISM MEANING DOCTORS WHAT JUST TELL PEOPLE THIS IS WHA YOU'RE GOING TO DO SO YOUR PERIODS ARE IRREGULAR HERE IS THE BIRTH CONTROL PELL AND THEY'RE NOT EXPLAINING WHY OR THE PROSE AND CONS TO IT AND WHAT HOPENT AS PEOPLE ARE NOT BEING TAUGHT HOW THEIR BODIES WERE CAN NOW THEY ARE BECAUSE OF YOUR PODCAST AMONGST OTHERS AND NOW THEYRE ABLE TO KNOW THAT MY PERIODS OF VITAL SIGN AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BECAUSE THE PILL IS PRODUCING A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT THE PILLS ALSO BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH POTENTIALLY DEVELOPMENT OF THINGS LIKE LEAKY GUT OR IBEAS AND SO THERE IS A DEFINITE CHANGE IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT WHEN YOU'RE ON THE BIRTH CONTROL PELL INCREASE RISK OF BLOOD CLOTS BECAS OF HOW ITS PROCESS IN THE LIVER INCREASING YOUR CLATDING FACTORS CANI JUST A IAR YOU KNOW A WERE UM THE A A FAIR FREELY HIGH PERCENT OF PEOPLE HAVE A MUTATIONS IN FACT OR FIVE LIGHTIN A CLOTTING FACTOR A FEWER PEOPLE ARE AS WE SAY HOMAS I GUESS HAVE TWO DEFICIENT COPIES A MUTEN COPIES I SHOULD SAY A BUT THEYRE MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE TH HAVE ONE MEATIN COPY OF FACTOR FIVE LIDON IND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT ORL CONTRACEPTION IN FEMALES UM CAN REALLY EXASCERBATE THE FACTOR FIVE LIDIMUTATION DO YOU SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE GET UM GET THEIR FACTOR FIVE LIDON UM CEONETIC ANALIST IT'S PRETTY INEXPENSIVE TO DO IGHT I THINK ON A STANDARD BLOODCASS YOU CAN DISASK FOR THE FACTOR FIVE UM ANALYSIS IN IT'S NOT LIKE A A REALLY INDEPT THING YOU'D OUGHT TO FLY TO AS TA BLOOD TAS YE ONT  YE LIS YOUD DON'T TO FLIGHT O ANOTHER COUNTRY  LIKE YOU DO FOR MANY THINGS UM IT'S IMPORTANCE HEY DOES NOT THE NORM RIGHTLY THAT'S NOT THE RECOMMENDATION WHEN YOU'RE TOGGING ABOUT PUTTING SOMEBODY ON THE BIRTH CONTROL PELL YOU WANT O MATUR THEY DON'T HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE CAUSE IT CAN INCREASE THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE YOU WANE TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T SMOKE CIGARETTES BECAUSE THE COMBINATION OF THE PILL AND CIGARETTES SMOKING CAN INCREASE THE RISK OF A STROKE BUT THE RECOMMENATIONS NOT TO SCREEN THEM TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY INHERITED CLOTTING DISORDERS THAT'S SAD IF YOU EVER HAVE A BLOOD CLOT ON THE BIRTH CONTROL PELL CAUS YOU'RE TRAVELLING ON A PLAIN OR YOU'RE JUST ON THE PILLAR LIVING YOUR LIFE YOU'RE NOW GIN TO GET THIS EXTENSIVE WORK UP TO FIND OUT IF YOU DO HAVE THAT IT'S BY NO MEANS WRONG AND SPECIFICALLY YOU SHOULD IF ANYBODY IN YOUR FAMILY HAS EVER HAD A DEEVY TEA SO A DEEP VAIN THROMBO SAYS SO BLOOD COT IN THEIR LG OR A PULMINARY AMBALISM OR A P  SO ANYBODY IN YOUR FAMILY AS HAD ONE OF THOSE YOU SHOULD A HUNDRED PER CENT GET WORKED UP FOR CLOTTING DISORDERS AND IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE IT YOU CARRY FACTOR FIVE YOU SHOULD NO LONGER TAKE THE BIRTH CONTROL PELL AND SPECIFICALLY THE PILL BECAUSE IT'S AN ORAL PILL AND HOW IT'S MATABOLIZES IN THE LEVER IS ACTUALLY WHAT IS CAUSING THE CHANGE IN THOSE CLOTTING FACTORS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE MADE AS WELL SO IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T TAKE ANY FORM OF CONTRACEPTION BUT WE DO WHEN I MAKE SURE THAT WE COUNSEL YOU APPROPRIATELY I NEVER THINK IT'S WRONG TO BE AN ADVOCATE FOR YOUR OWN HELTH OR TO ASK QUESTIONS IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT SCREENING I MAY A'LL GET ON MY SOAP BOX CAUSE WITH LOKE ABOUT SCREENING FOR OVERING RESERVE AND IT IS A HUNDRED PER CENT NOT RECOMMENDED EVEN THOUGH I THINK IT SHOULD BE YOUD THE MOY NEXT QUAT OU IBE ABOUT TESTING A MA SLEVEL TA AND UM AND WILL RETURN TO THAT FOR THOSE THAT HEAR THAT AND IT SOUNDS CRIPTIC AS WELL AS GETTING AN ALTRASON TO SEEN BASELY HOW MANY ANY EGGS OR ARE LIKELY TO BE IN IN THE VAULT ON  ON BOTH SIDES SO WE IS REMEMBER THAT SCREENING RECOMMENDATIONS COME FROM AT WHAT POINT IN THE POPULATION DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO SPEND THE MONEY TO TESTS FOR A DISEASED BASE ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF FINDING IT SO IF WE THINK ABOUT RIGHT THAT'S WHAT YOUR PAPSMARE GUID LINES AND YOUR COLONOSCAPE AND YOUR MAMMIGRAMS EVERYTHING IS ALBASE ON WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO FIND ENOUGH CASES AT SOME AGE TO MAKE IT WORTH WHILE TESTING WHICH IS A CRAZY PRINCIPLE ESPECIALLY IN THE UES BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENTS NOT PAING FOR OUR HEALTH CARES SO WHY SHOULD THESE GUIDE LINES BE BASED ON WHEN IS IT COST EFFECTIVE TO DO TUSTING WHY I ALL PUT IN AT THIS IS GIN ASOUND A LIL BUT CONSPIRATORIAL BUT IT'S NOT IM AND I THINK THAT GIVEN THAT FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE INSURANCE PRIVATE PAID INSURANCEER THROUGH THEIR WORK OM THAT THERE'S A COST TO DOING THESE TESTS OF ANY KIND COLONOS COBE A MATES ET CETERA AND THEY MUST HAVE FIGURED OUT THE YOU KNOW OPTIMAL POINT ON THE GRAFH WITH WHICH THEY CAN REDUCE THEIR PAY OUT TO PEOPLE WHO FOR INCTANCE GET COLIN CANCER IF THEY DIDN'T GET THE COLONOSCOBE AT FORTY FIVE AS SUPPOSE TO FIFTY IS OPPOSED TO SIXTY HAS UPPOSE TO TWENTY FIVE I MEAN THIS IS AMID THE REALITY WE KNOW IS THAT THE MORE INFORMATION YOU HAVE THE BETTER CHOICES YOU CAN MAKE I MAN THE ONLY COVY OT TO THAT WOULD BE THAT FOR SOME NOT ALL BUT FOR SOME PEOPLE SERV OF THE HYPROCONDRIATIC TYPE SOMETIMES MORE INFORMATION LEAS TO MORE ANXIETY WHICH LEADS SOE MORE PROBLEMS BUT THAT'S A RARE INSTAT IS I ALWAYS THINK THAT IN GENERAL DATA IS ALWAYS GOT I AGREE HAVING THE INFORMATION AT HAND ABOUT YOUR BODY AND BEING ABLE TO MAKE EDUCATED CHOICES VERSES BEING IN A POSITION WHERE YOU SAY I HAD NO IDEA THAT I HAD FACTOR FIVE LIGHT AND AND I HAD THIS TERRIBLE BLOOD COHT BECAUSE POLMARAMBLISMS CAN KILL PEOPLE WE ALL KNOW THAT RIGHT SO WE TALK ABO T THIS RARE THING BUT IT CAN HAPPEN FOR THIS IS REALLY WERE IT CAN BE TOUGH IT CAN BE TOUGH TO FIND EVEN A DOCTOR WHO MADE LIKE WAS THAT FACTOR FIVE AS A BLOODTUS AND RELATIVELY AN EXPENSVESIFE THAT ONE IS NOT HARD BUT PHYSICIANS LIVE IN A WEIRD WORLD WHERE OU THEY HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS BASE ON SCREENING BASE ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF FINDING DISEASE THAT THEY FOLLOW AND WHEN THEY GO OFF OF THOSE THEY START INTRODUCING THEMSELVES TO WHY ARE YOU NOT FOLLOWING MEDICAL GUIDE LINES BUT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL THIS IS REALLY TOUGH TO ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELF AND THE ONE THING THAT I'LL SAY TO THIS IS WHY PAYING ATTENTION TO YOUR BODY IT'S SO IMPORTANT RIGHT UNDERSTANDING YOUR STOOL HABITS IN WHAT'S NORMAL ON WHAT'S NOT SO THAT YOU CAN CATCH EARLY SIGNS OF THINGS AND PRESENT FOR THAT COLONOSCOP EARLIER THE CURRENT SCREENING GUY LINE FOR SHOULD YOU GET YOUR OVERING RESARVE CHECKED IS THAT YOU SHOULD NOT ACOG THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBEDUIANNE HAS AN ENTIRE PRACTISE VULLITAN SITUATION SAYING THERE'S NO UTILITY AND SCREEING FOR HAMAGE A  MN I TOTALLY DISAGEE BED YOU HAVE GLAD A DISAGREEMENT TO ME IT JUST SEEMS NOT A UM OR OVERIS RATHER I MEAN THE UM THE AMACHIS A BLOOD DRAW A MA US THE BLOOD T HAS A BLOOD DRAW I IT ONE COULD OUGHT TO DO THE UM ULTRA SOUND IS WELL WHICH IS COURSE MORE INVASIVE BUT BUT WOMEN WHO ARE SEEING THEIR OGU AN ARE PROWLY FAMILIAR WITH WITH WITH UM COLIC EXAMPHS YE I MEAN SAN THAT ISNA ALTER SOUND BUT IT'S NOT PAINFUL NOT PAINFUL UM BUT DIFFERENT THEN A BLOOD DRAW JUST WI JUST FOR IN FULLEST CLOSUR SO UM AND YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD OF WOMEN IN THEIR EARLY THIRTIES GOING IN GETTING THER RAMMAE SLUP WILS CHECKED ING THEIR ULTRASON AN GOING ALL MY DIDNESS THEY'RE DOWN TO LIKE YOU KNOW I I DON'T THROUGH OUT NUMBERS CAS THIS ASHION YET TRICKY UM YOU KNOW THEY'LL SEE OH YOU HAVE WHATEVER YOU KNOW FORFOLICLES AND THEN SOME ONE IN THEIR EARLY FORTIES WILL HAVE TWENTY FOLICLS AND THEN PEOPLE STARTIT YOU SIT SHOR BECOMES A SCORE KEEPING THING AND AND OF COURSE FAULICAL QUALITY THERE MUCH AOTHER THING YET OF AND THAT YOU CAN TELL US MORE ABOUT THOSE BUT LET'S SAY SOME ONE DID NOT HAVE INSURANCE OR OR INSURANCE PERMISSION TO UM TO GET THIS PAY FOR WHAT IS THE PROXIMATE COST OF GETTING ONE'S A M H LEVELS IN ALIST SEVENTY NINE DOLLARS SEVENTY NINE KNOLLARS TO FIND OUT ESSENTIALLY WHERE YOUR OVERYING RESERVEICE AND SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS I DESE S MY SO BACK SO ACOCK SAYS YOU SHOULDN'T SCREEN IT BECAUSE A M H DOES NOT PRINT YOUR FOR KIND OF BILITY RIGHT YOUR BODY'S ABILITY TO GET PREGNANT IN THAT MONTH IS INDEPENDENT OF YOUR A M H AND FOR THE MOST PART THAT'S TRUE RIGHT BECAUSE LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A PERSON AND THEY'RE BOTH THIRTY OF TWO PEOPLE ONE HAS LO O VERING RESERVES THEY A E FIVE EGGS COMING OUT OF THE VAULT AND THIS ONE HAS NORMAL OVERING RESERVE AND IF TWENTY EGGS COMING OUT OF THE VOLL A WE SHOULD PRI CLARIFID THAT THE NUMBER CAUSE YOU SAID THIS EARLIER BUT THE NUMBER OF EGGS COMING OUT THE VAULT IS AN INDIRECT MEASURE OF HOW MANY EGGIS IN THE VAULT WHEN THAT NUMBER IS GOING DOWN IT MEANS THE NUMBER OF EGGS IN THE VAULT IS LIKELY GOING I ALSO DOWN HO LIKE YOUR BODY SERS TO TAKE SMALLER WITH DRAWALS AS YOU STARE TO RUN OUT YES THE T ALL ONCES TO BE AT LIKE EQUILIBRIAM RAY IT REALLY WANTS TO BE IN THIS MIDDLE GROUND SO WHEN YOU TOO MANY IT SHOOTS OUT MORE EVERY MONTH IT'S TO CROWDED IT DOESN'T WANT THAT AND THEN WHEN IS SARTS TO GET LO IT GETS SCARED ABOUT BEING EMPTY AND SENDS OUT FEWER PER MONTH SO WHAT YOU SEE OUTSIDE THE VAULT AND THAT IS CALLED AN ANTROPHOLICAL COUNTER AN A F C IT'S AN AULTRASOUND BASE MEASUREMENT OF HOW MANY EGGS YOU HAVE OUTSIDE THE VAULT AT ONE POINT IN TIME AND ON THE ALTR SOUND IF ONE LOOKS O THIS AGINA SHEP IS SO IT LOOK LIKE UM LITTLE HOLLOW SPACES LIKE SO NOT GRAY STUFF BUT BUT YA Y BODIES I SAY CHOCOLATE CHIPS IN THE CHOCOLATES OF COOKIY IF WE CAN IMAGINE THAT OH YOU'R A AIC LOOKS LIKE A CHOCOLATES OF COOKY THE CHOCOLATE CHIPS SMALL LITTLE DARK FLUIT PHILFOLICLS EACH ONE OF THOSE HOUSES AN EGG SOME BIGGER THAN OTHERS BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE MATURE THAN OTHER A ONE WHEN YOU CHECK IN THE CYCLES O IF YOUARE LOOKING IN THAT EARLY FILICULAR FASE WHEN SOMEBODY'S ON THEIR PERIOD THEY ALL SHOUD BE SMALL BECAUSE NOTHING'S BEEN SIMULATED IF I'M LOOKING PARYOPULATORY I'LL SEE THAT DOMINANT POLICAL THAT'S ABOUT TO OPULATE AND THEN EVERYTHING ELSE WILL BE SMALL AND IS THERE A GRAFT THAT PEOPLE CAN A LOOK AT ER THAT WE COULD LINK TO THAT SAYS OKE THE THE AVERAGE WITH THE DISTRIBUTION OF YOU DON'T STANDARD OUR ON EITHER SIDE FOR LET SAY A TWENTY EIGHT YEAR OLD WOMAN OR A THIRTY SEVEN YEAR OLD WOMAN OR FORTY FIVE YEAR OLD WOMAN OF THE NUMBER OF FOLICALS ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT SIDE AND AS I UNDERSTAND A SYMMETRIES ARE COMMON YETUM TENDS TO BE YOU KNOW LIKE A SONE GOES IN IN THE GOT SIX FOLICALS ON THE LEFT SIDE AND TWELVE ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE THEY HOW HOW TO PEOPLE GAUGE WHAT WHAT VAN ETHER INTS ON BECAUSE THEIR DOCTOR SHOULD TELL THEM UT THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN BUT YES WE'D WE ADD THESE COUNTS TOGETHER TO GET YOUR ANTROPHOLICAL COUNT BECAUSE THERE IS OFTEN A CEMETRY BUT WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT TO LET'S SAY IN SOMEBODY WHO'S THIRTY IS YOU SHOULD HAVE IN THE SIXTEEN TO TWENTY RANGE OF TOTAL FOLICALS PER MONTH RIGHT AND LEFT SIDE COMELINE OCEN CAB WHEN YOU'RE THIRTY FIVE THAT NUMBER IS CLOSER TILL LAKE FOURTEEN TO SIXTEEN SO STARTING TO DROP BUT SO PRETTY GOOD WHEN YOU'RE FORTY IT'S EIGHT TEN WHEN YOU'R FORTY FOUR TWO TOFOUR RASE START TO HAVE THIS IMMENSE DROP THAT EXPENENTIALLY STARTS TO INCREASE REALLY AROUND AGE THIRTY SEVEN SO THINGS STARTS A KIND OF GED INTO THIS SEVERE ZONE REALLY AFTER AGE THIRTY SEVEN WE REALLY TALK ABOUT AGES EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO GET PREGNANT IN THAT THERANGE RACKET ARE IS THE FOLICAL COUNT VERY VERY HIGH AS THERE SERVENACE IS A NON WHEN YOUR DROP OFF OR THE OTHER FOLICAL CUNT WOULD BE HIGHER AND I'M NOT OCCASONALLY HAVE PATIENTS WHO ARE VERY YOUNG BUT HAVE IN FRTILITY AR ONE OR FREES THEIR AGS I ALSO I PATIENTS AND NOT A DRAIN TO ARE IN PREMATURE VRIN FAILURE RIGHT BECAUSE THERE CAN BE THINGS THAT GO WRONG EVEN EARLY BUT WE SHOULD PRITY HIGHLIGHT AGAIN SOMETHING THAT YOU SAID EARLIER BUT GASHI YOU KNOW THIS WHAT CONTRADICTS SO MUCH OF WHAT'S OUT THERE WHICH IS THAT EVEN IF YOU HAVE LOWFOLIC ACCOUNT IF YOU COLLECT EGGS YOU'RE NOT CHANGING WHAT'S IN THE VAULT YOU'RE NOT COLING FROM THE BLNOT YOU CAN'T RITE THAT THOSE EGGS ARE SPENT YOU NOW HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TURN THEM INTO POTENTIAL PREGNANT CORRECT I MEAN SI'D KNOW RIGHT WE HAVE EVEN DOVEN TO IVY F BUT THAT'S THE NEXT WAVE OF TACNOLOGY IS WHAT WE CALL IVI M AND VETRMATURATION PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW CAN YOU GET EGGS FROM THE VAULT AND GET THEM TO CROW AND THE LAB BECAUSE THAT WOULD OPEN UP POSSIBILITIES FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE FEW ARE EGGS TO HAVE OUR HIGHER EFFICIENCY OF THIS PROCESS BECAUSE ONE OF THE LIMITING FACTORS WHEN YOU'RE DOING FERTILITY YOU'RE DOING EG FREEZING OUR IVIEF IS HOW MANY EGGS CAN YOU GET PERMONTH AND NOT SPY SOME PEOPLE F TO DO PCYCHEL AFTER PCYCLE BECAUSE THEY CAN ONLY GET FIVE EGGS OR FIVE EGGS BUT IF WE CIRCLE BACK TO WHAT WE WERE SAYING WHEN WE GOT OFF ON THIS BEAUTIFUL TANGENT IS THAT NO MATTER OF YOU HAVE FIVE OR YOU HAVE TWENTY EGGS OUTSIDE THE VALL YOU'RE OBULATING ONE SO YOU'RE TRYING TO GET PREGNANT NATURALLY THAT'S WHAT THE CUNDABILITY IS PROBABILITY OF GETTING PREGNANT PERMOUT NATURALITY YOU HAVE THE SAME CHANCE IF YO 'RE THE SAME AGE REGARDLESS OF IF YOU HAVE FIVE EGGS ARE YOU HAVE TWENTY EGGS AND THAT'S WHY ACOG CAME IN AND SAID WELL A M H DOESN'T IMPACT FO CUNDABILITY IT DOESN'T PREDICT YOUR ABILITY TO GET PRAGNENT OR WHOSE GOING TO HAVE IN FERTILITY AND WHOS NOT GOING T HAVEN FERTILITY SO THERE'S NO UTILITY AND SCREENING FOR IT IN PEOPLE NOW FOR WANT SOME SPEECHLESS I MEAN THAT THAT ARGUMENT MAKE SENSE THROUGH THE LENDS OF JUST PROBABILITIES OF PREGNANCY UM THROUGH NATURAL CONCEPTION UM BUT COMPLETELY ARACES THE VERY VERY VERY REAL SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE MAKING CHOICES ABOUT FOR INSTANCE WHETHER NOT TO STAY WITH A GIVEN PARTNER WHETHE NOT TO LEAVE A GIVEN PARTNER WHETHER NOT TO ACCELERY THE PROCESSESS BUILDING A FAMILILY MY EGG A HAVE A BABY NAI THAT THEY'R'E SO MNI AS ORICE S AMERICAN COLLEGE IF WHOEVER WHOEVER IS LIKE COMPLETELY O GO IM SIRE LODYLY ILS BUT THEY'RE CRAZY AND THAT WHAT I SAY THEY THEY ARGUE AND THEIR STATEMENT THAT FINDING THAT YOU HAVE I MIG NOT I'M REALING IN  ANYTHING AT I THING IN ANALOGY THAT DOESN'T FAIL BUT IT'S LIKE IF YOU CAN IT'S AS LIKE SAYING OIF YOU CAN WALK NOW GREAT THERE'S NO REASON TO TEST FOR THIS INEVITABLE PARALYSIS THIT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AT DIFFERENT RATES IN DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND THE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO OFFSETY IN OTHER WORDS YOU COULD LIKE TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF SOME TISSUE THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO WAL RAY IN THE FUTURE BUT WHENE I CAN DO THAT BECAUSE IF YOU CAN WALK NOW YOU CAN WALKIT UT NOW THAT'S ABSURD THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT IS AND THEY SAY WELL FINDING OUT THAT YOU HAVE LOW OVERIN RESERVE AT A YOUNG AGE IS GOING TO CAUSE UNDUE STRESS THAT IS UNWARRANTED BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE IN FRATILITY AND SO THEY'RE PURELY PUTTING IT THROUGH THE LENDS OF YOUR LIKELIHOOD TO GET PRAGNANT BUT INTO ACTIONABLE STRESS EXACTLY I GIVE INI DISTRESS LIKE HA GUESS WHAT AND YOU KNOW I KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WITH HUNTINGTON SIMUTATIONS AND SOME OPTO NOT NO WHETHER NOT THEY THEMSELVES HAVE HAVE THE HUNTINGTONSIMUTATION AND AND IT'S A VERY PERSONAL CHOICE RIGHT ERE BUT HERE THAT WHEREAS UNFORTUNATELY THERE STILL ISTENS A A CURE FOR HUNTINGTON'S HOTELY SOME DAY THERE WILL BE NOL COME WOULD BUT IN THE MEANTIME THERE IS ESSENTIALLY A CURE FOR THE SITUATION WHICH IS THE HARVEST AND POTENTIAL FOR LIZIE AT LEAST AN OPPORTUNITY AND THIS IS WHAT I SAY AND OF COURSE YOU AND I FEEL SM ILY EDUCATION AND DOUT I LIKE BEING THE ONE TO MAKE THE TWAS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION VERSES HAVING IT HAPPENED TO YOU SO IF YOU ARE YOUNG AND YOU FIND OUT YOU HAVE LOW OVERIN RESERVE IS I GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND IT VERY WELL MIGHT YOU MIGHT NOW FREEZE YOUR EGGS WHEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT NOW START TO TRY TO GET PREGNANT IF YOUR PARTNERD WHEN YOU OTHERWISE WERE JUST WAITING UT WIN MY CONVERSATION WITH YOUR PARTNER RAY RIGHT BECAUSE A LOT OF YOUWLL THINK THEY CAN JUST WAIT I DON'T YOU B AS OF A TROUOR OR THERNY I CAR MOTALLY WAIY BUT IF YOU HAVE A LOW OVERING REERVE THEN THAT YOU MAY LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PARENT HOOD AND FOR LOT OF PEOPLE THIS IS A LIFEGOL AND THIS IS WITH WILD TO ME WHEN ON EARTH BESIDES REPRODUCTION DO WE HAVE LIFE GOALS THAT WE TAKE THE APPROACH I'LL JUST WAIT AND SEE IF IT'S A PROBLEM LATER NEVER RIGHT IF YOU WANT TO BECOME A DOCTOR YOU WANT TO BECOME AN ATHLE YOU ARE CONSTANTLY WORKING TOWARDS THAT GOAL OR UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO GET THERE BUT WHY DOES THE GOAL OF PARENTHOOD THAT THE ATTITUDE IS COMPLETELY I'M NOT GOING TO THINK ABOUT IT AND TILL LATER AND THEN I'LL DEAL WITH IT IF IT BECOMES A PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU CAN MAKE CHAINT CHOICES YOU COULD FREEZE YOUR EGGS YOU COULD TRY TO GET PREGNANT SOONER YOU COULD IF VALUEAIT FOR REASONS OF LOW OVERIN RESERVET YOU'VE A GENETIC MUTATION OR AN AUTUUMU DISEASE WHY IS IT LOW IT'S NOT JUST ALWAYS A BIG IN KNOWN THERE CAN BE SOME ACTUAL THINGS THAT POTENTIALLY MIGHT BE IMPACKFUL FOR YOUR HEALTH LONG TERM SO I THINK IT'S WHILD THAT THIS IS THE CURRENT CONVERSATION AND I WILL SAY I KNOW PERSONALLY A LOTA OU BE JUE I ENDS WHO ONE HUNDRED PERSON WE'LL DRAW AN AMAGE BLOOD TASK IF YOUR A YOUR ANNUAL AND YOU ASK AND I RECOMMEND ALL OF MY OBY FRIENDS CAUSE I SEE PEOPLE AT A DIFFERENT STATE DRAPE WHEN THEY SEE ME THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO GET PREGNAN OR THEY WANT AO FREES THEIR EGGS BUT WE TALK ABOUT THIS I SAY HAY JUST LIKE YOU SAY ARE YOU TRYING TO GET PREGNANT NOW AND IF SOMEBODY SAYS NO AND YOUR FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS WILL DO YOU WANTO BE ON BIRTH CONTROL THE SAME QUESTION SHOULD BE WILL DO YOU WANT TO BE PREGNANT AT SOME POINT AND IF SO SHOULD YOU CONSIDER FREEZING YOUR EGGS OR GETTING THIS BLOOD TAST CHECKED AND VERY OFTEN PEOPLE WILL MAKE A DIFFERENT DECISION WITH THAT INFORMATION I'M SO GLADLY YOUR HELLING THIS BECAUSE MY UNDERSANDING IS AT WEAST IN THE STATE A CALIFORNIA O O AT OTHER STATES WOR FE VERYS BY STATE THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO HARVEST EGGS AN FREES THEM  THERE SAY HARD CUT OFF THAT AGE I THINK IT IS FORTY TWO PROTAGE FORTY TWO O THEY'LL DO IT OM AFTER FORTY TWO THEY'LL DO IT IF AND ONLY IF YOU'RE WILLING TO DO IN VETRFORLIZATION ACTY FOR LIZON THAN THEYRL FREES EMBRYOS BUT THEIR FOR MORE RELUCTANT TO COLLECT EGGS AFTER AE FORTY TWO YET YES AND NO SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT EGG FRES IN AN IVIAF ARE REALLY THE SAME PROCESS RIGHT WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THE EXACT SAME THING YOU'RE TAKING THE EGGS OUT OF THE BODY AND THEN YOU'RE EITHER JUST FRASING THEM AS AN EGG OR YOUR FERTILIZING THEM AN THE LAP AND THAT'S IVIA AND MAKING AN MBRYO RIGHT AWAY EGGFREEZING HAS CHANGED DYNAMICLY OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS WHEREAS TEN YEARS AGO SURVIVAL RATE OF EGGS IN THE LAP WAS FORTY PER CENT REALLY TERRIBLE AND SO WE REALLY DIDN'T OFFER IT TO MANY PEOPLE IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT AND NOW IT FEELS TRENDY ALMOST BUT IT'SREALY JUST THE TECK HAS GOTTEN SO MUCH BETTER AND CHEAPER YE NINETY PER CENT OF EGS NOW SURVIVED THE FREE CAL SO NINETY PERCENT IS NOT A LOW NUMBER BY ANY MEANS EMBRYOS ARE MUCH STRONGER RATE AND EGG IS A SINGLE CELL IT'S A SINGLE CLL AND MBRYO WHEN WE FREES AN EMBRYO THAT STAY FIVE OR SIX IS THREE HUNDRED PLUSCELLS SO IT'S SO MUCH STRONGER AND THOSE EMBRYOS SURVIVED THE FREES THOUGHT NINETY NINE PER CENT OF THE TIME SO YES THERE'S A NINE PER CENT DIFFERENTS THAT BEING SAID MAKING EMBRYOSS A LOT MOREXPENSIVE EGGS IS CHEAPER YOU COULD DO TWO ROUNDS OF EGGS AND HAVE JUST AS MANY EGGS OR M HAVE MORE EGGS THAN IF YOU'D MADE THEM IN TO EMBRYOS RIGHT AWAY SO I NEVER RECOMMEND THAT SOMEBODY COMMITS TO A SPERM SOURCE THAT THEY DON'T WANT A HAVE A CHILD WEST UNLESS THAT'S THE SPERM SOURCE THEY WANT TO HAVE A CHILD AND THIS HAS CHANGED BECAUSE WHEN MBRYO SURVIVAL WAS SO MUCH GREATER THAN EGG SURVIVAL ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAD FEW EGGS OR YOU ARE OLDER MAKING EMBRYOS WAS THE ONLY OPTION WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT EGG QUALITY DECREASES IMMENSELY AS WE GET OLDER AND WE'VE TOUCHED ON THIS WE HAVEN'T REALLY MENTIONED IT SO NOT ONLY DO YOU HAW FOU ARE EGGS AS YOU GET OLDER THE CRUMISOMES AND SIDE STARTS YOU LOSE THEIR POSITIONING AND SO WE THINK ABOUT EQUALITY WE THINK ABOUT GENETIC NORMAL SEA AND WE KNOW THAT THE RATES OF ANNUPLOITY OR ABNORMAL CHROMOSOMES INCREASE IS PROPORTIONALLY TO YOUR AGE WHICH UM FOR PEOPLE AT ARENAWERE RE GOING TO PREDISPOSE NOT ALWAYS EM TO MISCARRIAGES IF THERE IMPLANTED OR POTENTIALLY EVEN AT THE FORMATION OF IT OF THE FEATIS THAT CARRIES FOR INSTANCE TRUS TO MES SO CRO CROMISON REPEATS OR AM LACK OF LACK OF CERTAIN CROMANS THESE COUN BE DEADLY OR THEY COULD BE A CAPABLE CARRING TO TERM AND THEN BULD HAVE UNDETECTABLE DOMIL TO SEVERE DEVELOPMENTAL AM ABNORMALITIES CORRECT CORRECT AND THIS IS THIS IS WHY YOU HAVE A LOWER PROBABILITY OF PREGNANCY PERMONTH AS YOU GET OLDER SO WE LOOK AT YOUR NATURAL FORCANDABILITY IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU HAVE FEW ARE AGS BECAUSE WE ALREADY SAID YOUR EGCOUNT PERMONTH AT DOESN'T IMPACT YOUR PROBABILITY ETTING PREGNANT IT'S BECAUSE THE NORMAL SEA OF THOSE CHREMOSOMES HAS CHANGED SO DRAMATICALLY THAT THE ODDS THAT YOUR BODIES RANDOMLY CHOOSING THE GOOD ONE TO ODULATE BECOMES SO LEL AND NOT'S WHY THOSE NATURAL FERTILITY RATES ARE SO LOW BECAUSE MOST GENETICALLY ABNORMAL AGS DO NOT FERTILIZE OUR IMPLANT BUT IF THEY DO THEY HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER CHANCE IF MIS CARRIAGE IS FORTY PER CENT AT AGE FORTY RATE SO YOU HAVE A MUCH LOWER CHANCE OF SEEING THE POSITOR PEGNACY TEST BUT THEN YOUR CHANCE OF LOSING THAT PREGNANCY IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AS WELL SO WHEN WE ARE COUNSELLING SOMEBODY ABOUT AGPHRASING WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT NOT EVERY AGG IS GOING TO FERTILIZE WITH SPERM GOING TO MAKE AN IMBRYO GOING TO BE GENETICALLY NORMAL OR EVEN IMPLANT WHEN IT IS GENETICALLY NORMAL THERE IS HUGE LOSS IN HUMAN REPRODUCTION MEANING THE MORE EGGS YOU HACE AT A YOUNGER AGE THE BETTER THE AROLI ON THIS PROCESS IS GON TO BE IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU DON'T DO IT WHEN PEOPLE GET OLDER BUT EVERY CLINIC DOES HAVE A CUT OFF AND EVERY CLINICS ON BE A LITTLE BUT DEFEREN LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS WHY WE ECTUALLY POBALY OVEN OLDER CUT OFF SO WE WILL LETS THEM TO GO THROUGH IVIAF OR FREES THEIR EGGS OP TAGE FORTY FIVE AND IT'S A LOT ABOUT INFORM CONSENT AND HAVING THE APPROACH THAT YOU'RE SMART ENOUGH THAT IF I GIVE YOU THE ODDS AND I WALK YOU THROUGH HOWMANY EGGS YOU ARE AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF THEM MAKING INTO EMBRYOS YOU CAN SAY YA BUT FOUR EGGS ARE TEN EGGS IS WAY MORE THAN ZERO BASE ON MY CIRCUMSTANT AND THAT IS WORTH IT TO ME BECAUSE IT GIVES ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO POTENTIALLY HAVE A CHILD WHEN OTHERWISE MY OPPORTUNITY IS GOING TO THE ZERO SO A LOT OF THIS IS ROOTED IN PATARNALISM THAT PEOPLE CAN'T AS A PATIENT UNDERSTAND THESE ODDS AND THEY HAVE UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS THE THERE'S A HUGE SHIFT AND REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE TO REALLY COUNSELLING PATIENT AND GIVING THEM AUTONOMY AND SOME OF THESE DECISIONS BUT THERE DOES BECOME A POINT WHERE THERE'S TO LIKELIHOOD OF FINDING A NORMAL EGG IS SO SO LOW THAT THE MONEY OR THE EXPENSE OF THE CROSSUS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND PEOPLE SHOULD UTILIZE EGDONATION AR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONCEPTION THIS DROP IN BOTH IN NUMBER OF EGGS AND THE EGQUALITY THEY REALLY STARE TO BECOME SO PROFOUND AT AGE THIRTY SEVEN AND ON  THAT'S WHEN WE REALLY STARE TO SEE BOTH THESE THINGS ARE OVERLAPPING AT THE SAME TIME SO IF YOU'RE WAITING TILL AGE THIRTY FIVE THIRTY SIX FOR YOUR FIRST KID BUT YOU WANT TWO OR THREE WE'VE GOT A REALLY LOOK FORWARD ABOUT IS THAT IT'S ASTRATEGY MAKE SENSE WELL WHAT IS YOUR M AGE ONE OR YOU GOINGTO RUN OUT OF EGGS BEFORE THEN TO HOW WHAT OTHER ISSUES COULD BE GOING ON IS THE SPERM FINE OF THE TUBES OPEN BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING THAT WHEN PEOPLE START FAMILIES LATER WHEN PEOPLE HAVE MORE CHRONIC ILLNESS AND AUTOUMUNE DISEASE AND O BECITY THAT IT'S MUCH HARDER TO GET PREGNANT AND SO THE BIRTH RATES RAY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME ACROSS THE BOARD ARE DROPPING AND IN FERTILITY IS RISING BECAUSE OF ALL OF THESE FACTORS COMPANED SO BASTED ON EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID AND YES OME ONE TO SAY AT A FIFTH TIME BECAUSE THE MISCONCEPTION ABOUT THIS IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS WHY PEOPLE AVOID  HARVESTING EGGS S NOT THE ONLY REASON BUT WHEN YOU HARVEST EGGS FREEZE THEM NOW SOUNDS LIKE THE VIABILITY OF THOSE EGGSES IS QUITE QUITE STRONG COMPARED A FEW YEARS AGO ASO THAT'S GREAT NINETY PER CENT A RECOVERY O WHEN THEY FAL THEM AM IS NOT GOING TO DIMINISH THE NUMBER OF EGGS IN THE VAULT SUCH A CRITICAL POINT AM AND POST THER AGE THIRTY SEVEN THERE'S A SOUNDSLIKE ANON LINEOR DROP OFF IN EGG QUALITY FOR MOST IN THESE ARE AVERAGES QUITE RIGHT SO EVERYONE N  BE UP SOTHER PEOPLE THEY A GOT PRIGNIN WITH HEALTHY KIDS IN THEIR LATE THIRTIES IN FORTIES YOU KNOW YES WE HEAR YOU UM CONGRATULATIONS WERE HAPPY AM BUT THIS SPEAKS TO THE AND OF THE THE LOGIC ANYWAY WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANY EMOTION OR CIRCUMSTANCES ON THIS BUT THE LOGIC OF SOMEBODY IN THEIR LET'S A LATE TWENTY ES EARLY THIRTY'S GETTING THEIR AY IN AH LEVELS THROUGHUSTS ROUGHLY EIGHTY DOLLAR BLOOD DRAW AM AND THEN PERHAPS BASED ON THEIR LIFE GOALS AND CIRCUMSTANCES DOING EITHER ONE OR SEVERAL ROUNDS OF EGG COLLECTION AND FREEZING ESPECIALLY SINCE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU DON'T NEED TO FERTILIZE THOSE EGGS SO IF ONE DOESN'T HAVE A PARTNER IS CONCERNED ABOUT WHA THEY'REGING TO DO WHOSE WHOSE GOING TO BE A WHO'S GIVEN PROVIDE THE SPIRM AT YOU KNOW I'M COURSE SOME PEOPLE CHOOSE TO RASE KIDS ON THEIR OWN AM BUT PARENT TINGS THE WHOLE OTHER ISSUE BUT AU THEY COULD DO THAT LATER SO THAT RAISES THE QUESTIONS OF WHAT ARE THE HEALTH RISKS IF ANY UM PAIN LEVELS IF ANY AND UM AND THAT INCLUDE PSYCHOLOGICAL PAIN OF EGG HARVESTS I MEAN TO SO GOING BACK TO WHT YOU SEID EARLIER THIS IS GOING TO BE INJECTING AM SYNTHETIC MIMICS OF EFFASATION ELL AH AUM FALKAL STIMULATING HORMON AND LUNIZING HORMON MAY BE SOME GROWTH HORM N I HEAR NOW ADAYS THERE'S ALSO THE PRACTICE OF INJECTING UM I THESE ARE ESSENTIALLY A PLETEL RICH PLASMA PR P A PLETELIH RICH PLASMESCUSE ME A PR P IN PERHAPS EVEN INTO THE OVARIAN VAULT WE CAN GET BACK TO THAT SO THERE'S A MUCH O STUFF THAT'S BEING DONE TO SOME ONE THERE'S LOW STIM WHERE PEOPLE ARE GETTING LIKE LOW DOSES OF THESE DRUGS ARE HIGH STIM WARDS LIKE A FULL BLAST MAYBE CAN WALK US THROUGH THAT PROCEEDURE IN JUST SORT OF GENERAL CONTUCT AS I YOU KNOW LD REQUIRE A LOT OF TIME TO GO THROUGH IT ALL IN DETAIL BUT IS THIS A HORRIBLE THING TO GO THROUGH OT IT MILD TO GO THROUGH IS IT LIKE A WALK IN THE PARK UM LET LET'S WALK THROUGH IT ALL SO II LOVE THUS IN THISMY BRET AND BETTERIN THIS IS WHAT I DO EVERY DAY STUDIES TELL US THAT IF YOU ARE NOT READY TO HAVE A FAMILY BY AGE THIRTY TWO TO THIRTY THREE THAT IS THE OBSIMAL TIME FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON TO INTERVENE AND FREEZE THEIR EGGS IT'S NOT UP FOR DEBATE IT'S WHEN YOU HAVE BOTH THE INTER SECTION AF STILL A GOOD EQUALITY AND GOOD EQUANTITY ON AVERAGE AND SO THAT IS THE YOUNGER THAN A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT HAVING FAMILIES AND THE REASON WHY IS WE REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE EGG AFTERWARD THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SOM ONE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT WHAT YOU GO THROUGH BUT JUST THINKING WE ARE TO SAID YOU FREEZ YOUR EGGS NINETY PERCENT OF THEM ARE GINO SURVIVE THE FREESA ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT WILL BE FERTILIZED BY SPIRM AND ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT OF THOSE WI'LL EVEN MAKE IT TO AN IMPLANTATION STAGE EMBRYO OR A BLAST MORE SUMING HEALTHY SPIRM SO A SQUARM THA FIRM NO IN A A UCCESSIVETY AN A FRAGLY DA HEHAD NY ON THE HEAD ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES WITH EGG FREEZING IS I DON'T KNOW THE FUTURE I DON'T KNOW IF THIS SPERM IS GOING TO BE GREAT OR NOT I DON'T GAN E FOM A POT SMOKER JUST GETTING POTSMOKERS NOT GETTING A POTSMOKERS WHY NOT BUT WE DON'T KNOW RIGHTS THAT WEHAVE THIS FUTURE YET UNDETERMINE SPIRM SOURCE SO I AM GOING TO ASSUME YOU'RE GON O FALL AVERAGE ON THESE DAT O POINTS THAT WERE GON TO WALK THROUGH BUT THE REALITY IS YOU BUFFER THE RISK BY HAVING MORE EGGS FROZEN AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH MULTIPLE ROUNDS OR CYCLES BECAUSE WE DON'T K NO WE DON'T KNOW HOW THAT FERTILIZATION WILL BE IF YOU HAVE TWENTY AGS AND EIGHTEEN SURVIVE THE FREEZE THOUG AND FOURTEEN FERTILIZE AND SEVEN MAKE IT TO THE BLASTESS A STAGE IF YOUR AGE THIRTY WE WOULD ANTICIPATE AROUND SIXTY TO SEVENTY PER CENT OF AM ARE GOING TO BE GENETICALLY NORMAL YOU'RE YOUNG  T'S ALREADY KIND OF A BIG HEAD AT THAT AGE SO LET'S SAY OF THE SEVEN FOUR OF THEM ARGENETICALLY NORMAL WHEN I GO TO TRANSFER THEM I HAVE AT BEST A SIXTY FIVE PER CENT CHANCE OF LIFE BIRTH PEREMBRYO WHICH IS REALLY GOOD WHEN YOU PUT IN THE LENDS OF A CUNDABILITY AND PIQUE SUCCESS TENCE TO BE CLOSER TO TWENTY PER CENT OUDNINPOINT ONE EMBRYOTO TO A HUNDRED PER CENT RAND IN PLANT ONE ANBRYO AT A TIME NOWS ANYWHONE AS CRUTO PEOPLE ASKE FOR TWO DOCTORS WILL DU TO IT IS IT LOWERS LIVE BIRTHRATS IF WE'RE LOOKING AT GIVING EAH EMBRYO THE HEALTHIEST OPPORTUNITY AT BECOMING A BABY NUMBER ONE EMBRYOS WITH IVIA HAVE A SLIGHTLY HIGHER CHANCE OF MONOS I GOT IT TWENTIN RITES O TWENTING FOR TURNAL TWENTING COMES IF YOU OVULATE TWO AGS THEY BOTH GET FERTILIZE SO EACH BABY IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GENETICALLY OWN EG OWN SPIRM MONOS IGOTIC IS FROM AN EMBRYO SPLIT BECAUSE OF THE IVIA PROCESS LIKELY PUTTING THE MBRYO IN THE CAFETER MAYBE HAVING THAT YOU KNOW OUTER SURFACE TOUCHED PREDISPOSES IT TO SPLUDING AFTER YOU PUT IT INTO THE BODY  WORE IDENTICAL TWIM YELLY O AUGHTER TWO TO THREE PER CENT CHANCE OF MONOS I GOT AT TWINS WITH IVIA AND THE NATURAL CHANCES POINT O THREE PER CENT SO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER EVEN THOUGH ULTIMATELY NOT A PROBABLE OUTCOME I'M AN NO HAVE A COUPLE PATIENTS A YEAR WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE MONOS I GOT A TWINS AND IF I PUT TWO EMBRYOS AND I'VE NOW ONE TAKEN THIS FROM A POTENTIAL TWIN PRAGNENTY TO A TRIPLETOR EVEN A QUAD IF THEY BOTH SPLIT TENS PRESUMABLY LIKE THE OCTO OM CASES ON THINKS LIKE WITHOUT WHEN THEY JUST LITERALLY PUT EIGHT EMBRYAS INSIDE BUT THAT'S THE WHOLE THEM N TAT'S MEDICAL MALPRACTISE RIT BUT REALLY MOST TH E TIME WHEN WE'RE TUGGING ABOUT EMBRYOS WERE TUGGING ABOUT PEOPLE  WITH INFERTILITY OR PEOPLE WHO SPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY A HUGE PORTION OF FERTILITY AS MBRYO QUALITY WRIT THE COMPETENCY OF THE EMBRYO THE GENUTICS OF THE MBRYO IT'S EXPENSIVE TO GO THROUGH EGFHREEZING AND IVY AFF YET THE UTER ENVIRONMENT IS ANOTHER COMPONENT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO WASTE MULTIPLE EMRYOS IN THE SAME UTERANE ENVIRONMENT STATISTICALLY DOESN'T MAKE SENTS HIT ALSO DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO MAKE YOUR EMBRYOS COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER SO WILL PEOPLE PUT ONE OBRYOINTO WA TUS SAY DEAN EMOM MI AND ONE INTO SURGETMOM AND ANTRA AND GET TO SIBLING AN SEMULTANEOUSLY I'VE DEFULALLY DONE NOT AND HAVE PATIENTE DO THAT IT'S NOT COMMON BECAUSE SERAGASE USING AGESTATIONAL CARRIER IS SO EXPENSIVE AND THEIRE SUCH LIMITED SUPPLY IT'S VERY HARD TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO GO THROUGH THE ACT OF CARRYING A CHILD FOR SOMEBODY ELSE BUT THAT DEFINITELY IS A STRATEGY THAT SOME PEOPLE UTILIZE ESPECIALLY IF THEIR OLDER OR THEIRE CONCERNED THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE A LOWER CHANCE OF IMPLANTATION BUT THEY WAN TO GIVE THEMSELVES A TRY BUT IF WE LOOK AT ONE MBRYO SIXTY FIVE PER CENT CHANCE OF SUCCESS CUMULATIVE PROBABILITY AFTER THE SECOND IS EIGHTY EIGHT PER CENT CRA ALMOST EVERYBODY'S PREGNENT AFTER TWO AND THESE ARE YOU PLOYED GENETICALLY NORMAL EMBRYOS ACRA AND THEN IF YOU GO TO THE THIRD SO CUMULIVELY AFTER THREE YOU PLAYED MRYO TRANSFERS EACH ONE BEING A SINGLE MRYO NINETY FIVE PER CENT OF PEOPLE HAVE A BABY IN THEIR ARMS MEANING THE INCIDENTS OF ER CURRENT IMPLANTATION FAILURE IS ACTUALLY PRETTY LO FIVE PER CENT BUT HOW MANY NORMAL EMBRYOS DO YOU NEED FOR WHAT FAMILY SIZE IF YOU ARE FREEZING YOUR EGGS BECAUSE YOU GOT TWENTY EGGS AT AGE THIRTY AND THE EXAMPLE I GAVE AND YOU JUST MADE FOUR NORMAL EMBRYOS RI SO THAT'S REALLY UNLIKELY TO MAKE THREE OR FOUR CEADS IT WOULD IT HAS A REALLY GOOD CHANCE OF MAKING ONE GIVES YOU THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A SECOND BUT THAT'S ALSO PRESUMING THAT EVERYTHING HAPPENED PERFECTLY THAT THE SPERM IS NOT POSMOKINGS MARM BUT YOU KNOWING NOT THAT QUALITY SPERM THERE'S NOT OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES WHEN IT COMES TOO YOUR OWN HEALTH WHEN YOU'R TRYING TO GET PRAGNAN OR OTHER DISEASES YOU MAY HAVE SO WE REALLY NEED A HIGHER NUMBER OF EGGS SPECIFICALLY WHEN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EQUATION WILL TRULY LOOK LIKE FOR ONE INDIVIDUAL PERSON WHEN THEY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND ONE OF THE ONLY ADDED BENEFITS OF EMBRYOS ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE PARTNER IF YOU'RE WISSOMEBODY WHO YOU DO WENE I HAVE CHILDREN WITH YOU JUST DONT ONE TO HAVE THEM YET IS THAT I KNOW THE DOWN STREAM I KNOW THE NUMBER I KNOW HOW MANY EMBRYOS I HAVE AND IF IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO GIVE YOU A HIGH CHANCE OF WHAT YOU WANT YOUR FAMILY TO BE YOU CAN INTERVENE NOW RIGHT BECAUSE BY DEFINITION WITH EG PHRASING WE'RE NOT WANTING TO BE PREGNA FOR YEARS SO IF YOU'RE DOING THIS WITH A PARTNER AND YOU ARE MAKING EMBRYOS AND NOW I SAY WE ONLY GOT ONE GENETICALY NORMAL EMBRYO YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE TO EITHER GO THROUGH MORE CYCLES AND STORE MORE EMBRYOS FOR LATER TO MAY BE TRIED TO GET PREGNENT SOONER BECAUSE THERE SOME UNDERLYING ISSUE WITH YOUR FERTILITY YOU CAN MAKE A CHOICE BECAUSE YOU'RE FALLING OFF THE CURVED THERE COULD ASK O QUSHION TO THIS A YOU MENTION ACH ABOUT THIRTY TO THIRTY THREE IN AN IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCE WITH THE FINANCES THERE ET CETERA ONE WOULD HARVEST A MEXEMLESS THE ALREADY STARTING A FAMILY NATURAL MEANS A WHAT ABOUT FOR SPERM WE WE'VE ALL HEARD THE STUDY TAT A WITH THE INCREASED AGE OF THE SPERM THAT THERE'S A HIGHER ALTHOUGH STILL STITITICALLY PRETTY SMALL INCENCE OF THINGS LIKE A SPECTRAL CONDITIONS AM SO DO YOU RECOMMEND TO YOUNG GER MALS EM AMEN IN THEIR A LATE TWENTY SJEARLY THIRTIES TO FREE SPERM I MEANS NEVER GO TO BE WRONG TO SAVE YOUR GAMMATES BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE CRYSTAL BALLS FOR THE FEW CHAIR WRITES YOUR GAMMINGES AR YOUR EGGS AND YOUR S PIRM THAT INCREASE AND WELL JUST SAY  NEGATIVE OUTCOME FROM ADVANCE PATERNAL AGE REALLY STARTS TO BE SEEN AT AGE FIFTY SO MOST MEN ARE NOT LOOKING AT PRIMARILY STARTING THEIR FAMILY AFTER THAT AGE HOWEVER WHAT I RENINTS YOU ALL THE TIME IS MAYBE YOU'R WORKIN ON THE SECOND FAMILY OR MAY BE LIFE HAS GONE DOWN A DIFFERENT PATHWAY AND NOW YOU'RE WITH A PARTNER WHO POTENTIALLY IS YOUNGER AND ANTS TO CONCEIVE AND YOU NOW HAVE OLDER SPIRM HAVING SPERM IN THE BANK IT'S SO CHEAP AND EASY TO FREE SPRM EGGS I HAVE ANYMEN ANSWERS YOUR PRIMARY QUESTION THEN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTING SPIRM YEW WELL NOT ENTIRELY  WITHOUT ITS ISSUES IS IS FOR IT'S IN TERE IS LON AT BAS IADVUT IT'S MUCH SIML AT'S R IMPLOYR THE'S GENERALLY DOESN'T REQUIRE HORMON INJECTIONS ALYOU KNOW MAYBE FOR RARE INCENCES WHERE PEOPLE ORE HIPLIGANATAL OR SOMETHING BUT IF YOURE GIN A FREESE YOUR SPERM YOURE RAY YOU TIPICALLY YOU'RE GOING TO GET SOME BLOOD WORK DONE BECAUSE MOST PLACES THAT STORE SPERM PER AFTER A GUYD LINES HAVE TO MAKE SHORE THAT IF YOU CARRIED AN INVECTUOUS DISEASE AT STORET IN A SPECIAL TANKS SHE OUGHT TO GET BLOOD WORK DONE THEN YOU HOUGHT TO ABSTAIN FOR YOUR TWO TO THREE DAYS COLLECT INTO A CUP YOUARE DONE WHICH BY THE WAY IAS YOU CAN DO AT HOME AND BRING IT IN SPIRM OR SO STA L FYOU EVER DONE THIS YEJUST BRING IT IN ITS FREE  MARY AND THA LITTLE MAN A LIT A BIT OF I I THINK NOT IN A THING THAT THA MY FRIEND DID THIS AND TOLD ME BUT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S CUN ABOUTRAGEOUSLY EASY IN THE SENSE THAT YOU JUST BRING IT IN AND THEYLL WHAT TAKE IT OUT IN THE LAWBY AN BYOU LIKE IS THAT YOUR NAME AND TLIKE VERY DIFFERENT IN THE EGG COLLECTION GANGER SO HERE'S HEARS WHAT I'LL SAY ABOUT SPIRM AND WHAT I WISH MORE MEN NEW SLESHWORMAN DEAD IF YOU'RE GING TO GET OF A SEC TO ME BECAUSE YOU ARE CHOOSING THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO HALF KEDS AND WE SEE MANY MEN WHO DO THIS REA THEY SAY THEY DON'T WANT AF KEDS THEY WANT TO GO GOED OF A SEC TO ME YET LATER ON IN LIFE YOU DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL ABOUT LIFE IS DYNAMIC AND THINGS CAN CHANGE IF YOU'RE GING O GET OF A SECT TO ME GO FREE SPIRM PIRST WHYARE SO MANY MEN GETTING TO SECTIMET I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT I HAN'T HEARD THIS Y A LOT OF MEN ARE GETING TO SECTO MES YOU EN I THITO JUST TAKE CONTROL OVER NOT HAVING CHILD OUT THERE WHEN THEY DON'T WANT TO SO EGUSE EXPLAINS THE DROPIN BERTHRETS A IS ARGES KITHAT IS E MIHTEVECTOR IS SO MANY PEOPLE EVEN IF YOU ARE IN YOUR FAMILYLISSY IF TWO KIDS AND ALL DECIDED YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE VESSECTO ME SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MORE CHILDREN THINGS HAPPEN TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN AND LIFE CHANGES THERE MIGHT BE A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE YOU POTENTUALLY WOULD HAVE ANOTHER KID IF SOMETHING REALLY BAD HAPPENED OR YOU JUST CHANGED YOUR MIND FREEZING SFIRM IS SO EASY AND SO MUCH EASIER THAN IF YOU DON'T NOT ALL THE SECTING Y REVERSAL'S WORK ESPECIALLY THE LONGER THAT IT'S BEEN REVERSE THE LOWER THE LIKELIHOOD THAT IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO WORK AND VERY OFTEN IF IT DOES YOU DON'T GET SFIRM AND SUFFICIENT LEVELS FOR A TIME INTERCOURSE AND YOU'RE SEEING ME AND THE OFFIS AND IN FREEZING SPORM IS CHEAP AN IT'S RELATIVELY TREATESLYK FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS RIGHT SO IT'S IT'S MUCH MUCH CHEAPER ALL IN THAN THE ENTIRE EGG FREZING PROCESS SO TO ANSWER THE ORIGINAL QUESTION WHN OU GO THROUGH EGGFREEZING MOST PEOPLE DO FANTASTIC AND WE'LL JIST USE EGG FREEZING AN IVI EFF INTERCHANGEABLY HERE BECAUSE WHAT YOU AS A PERSON IS GOING THROUGH TO HARVEST YOUR EGGS OR TO TAKE THEM OUT OF YOUR BODY IS EXACTLY THE SAME RIGHT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN EG FREEZING AN IVIAF IS ALL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS ON THE LAB END OF IT AFTER THEY'VE COME OUT OF YOUR BODY SO IF WE HAVE THIS GROUP OF EGGS THAT COMES OUT OF THE VAULT YOUR BODY DOESN'T WANT TO ALLOW THEM ALL TO GROW EVEN IF IT'S A LOW NUMBER RIGHT THAT'S THE CHECK AND BALANCE TO NOT HAVE SO MANY KEDS SO WE NEED TO OVERRIDE THAT PROCESS AND WHAT WE TEND TO DO WITH THIS IS TYOU USE A COMBINATION OF FORMONTAL MEDICATIONS AND VERY OFTEN I DESCRIBE IT TO PATIENTS AS SUPPRESSING YOUR BODY AND THEN STIMULATING IT SO IF I CAN TEMPORRARELY STOP THE PRODUCTION OF FS H AND YOU HAVE A GROUP OF EGGS COME OUT OF THE VAULT AND WE CAN IMAGIN THAT EFFASAGES THEIR FOOD AND THERE IS NO FOOD BECAUSE YOU'RE TAKING THE BIRTH CONTROL PELL FOR THREE WEEKS THESE EGGS ARE GOING TO SYNCRONIZE BE VERY SMALL BE VERY HUNGRY FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD THEIRE FASE RECEPTORS ARE OING TO OPEN ALL UP IT'S LIKE A NEST OF BABY BIRDS THAT ARE ALL NOW STARVING INSTEAD OF THE HUNGRY BIRD GETS THE WORM SO NOW WE GO WITH THIS SUPPRESSION PERIOD FOR A FEW WEEK WE CAN COME IN AND GIVE GENNAT A TROPENDS WHICH IS FS H AND  H FAS H IS NOW SYNTHETICALLY MADE IN A LAB IT'S VERY EAS S A SYTHETIC COMPOUND THAT MMAXS THE STRUCTURE OF THE BRAIN FAS H WE ACTUALLY CA'T SYNTHETICALLY MAKE L H VERY INTERESTING WE DON'T AV AWAY O MAKE IT YET AND SO WE USE THE PURIFIED URIN OF MENAPOZZLE WOMEN BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE IN MINAPAUSE YOUR FAS HAN L H LEVELS ARE NATURALLY SO HIGH BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THAT EGG TO MAKE SOME STRGM SO A HERSOME THE WE'VE COVERED MAL HOME ON HEALTH BEFORE AM AND THIS BEEN A DISCUSSION OF H C G HUMAN CORIONIGAN AT A TROPIN AND WHICH IS DESSENSIOLY MIMAC L H IN THAT IN THE RECEPTR IT DOES YEI SO IS A PIGNAL A A HUMAN CORYONIGAN AT A TROPIN IS IT PURIFIED FROM POSTMEN APOZZLE WOMAN'S EUR WE NON SIN IT'S SYNTHETIC AC G IS SYNTHETIC AND SO WHAT WHY CAN AT WHAT O MOT IT'S CALLED MINIPRE MEN IF YOU MAN APPEAR IS A COMBINATION OF FAS H AND  H THE REASON WHY WE GIVE H C G TO MEN TO TRY TO STIMULATE THIS FORMATAGENESIS PROCESS WHICH OF COURSE IF WE COULD JUST GIVE LH WOULD GIVE LH JUST THE SAME REASON WHY WE GEVE H C G FOR A TRIGGER IF WE ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH FRTILITY TREATMENTS AND WE'RE TRYING TO MEMAC THAT LH SERGE WHICH NATURALLY WOULD CAUSE OBULATION WE ACTUALLY ARE GIVING H C G BECAUSE IT DOES MAMAC LH WHEN IT COMES TO THE RECEPTOR ACTION OF IH BUT WHEN IT COMES TO REALLY ESPECIALLY IN GEDDING FELICULAR DEVELOPMENT AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN  H AND FS H MEANING LH IS REALLY PROVIDING SOME OF THE HORMONE SUBSTRAT THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE STERGM AND SO YOU REALLY NEED SOME ALAGE IN A LOT OF PEOPLE DEPINING ON YOUR PROTOCOL OR IF YOUR OLDER ON YOUR NATURALLY MAKING LESS THE EXAMPLE BLL THE OFF SHOT WOULD BE LIKE THE PICIOS PATIENT WHO HAS SOME NATURALLY HIGH LAE SOMETIMES THEY DON'T ACTUALLY NEED ALH AND THEIR PROTOCOL BUT THEY TAN OR THESE UPOSTMEN UPOS O WOEN TEN ER SUPPLYING THER OURE NO RAY ROY YES WER LAGAN OW ON AN I WHEN YOU SANOIER YE CUL Y ENTRO GO TO THE MENAPAUS ING PAI D URIN IT IT IS CALLED MENAPURE LIKE ITS PURIFIED MENAPOSTLE YEURAN RAY DNIAL I DO NOT YOU ONO KNOW THAT THEY NO NOW NOW THEY NO TEN THO WE USE AFFASATION ALLATES WILL JUST SAY AND LACK OF ETTER TERMS THOSE OF THE TWO PRIMARY COMPOUNDS THAT WERE GEVAN OVER THE COURSE OF ON AVERAGE A TWELVE DAY PURIED TO GET THE PHOLICLS TO GROW AND THE EGGS TO MATURE SO YOU CAN MEASURE EG MATURITY BY BLOOD LEVELS OF ESTRADILE AND BY TRANSFATIONAL ULTRASOUNDS SO WHEN YOUR GOING THROUGH EGG FREEZING AR IVYOUGH YOURE TAKING THESE PORMON SHOTS OF AFFASATION LAE THEY ARE GETTING THOSE POLICALS TO STARCH O GROW THE EGGS ARE STARTING TO MATURE WE ARE MONITURING THEM ALONG THE WAY TRYING TO DETERMINE THE TYING PERIOD WHERE WE THINK MOST OF THE EGGS WILL BE IN THE MATURE RANGE THESE EGGS HAVE GOTTEN TO MATURITY YOU THEN ARE GOING TO TAKE A TRIGGER SHOT WHICH ALLOWS THAT FINAL STAGE OF MYOSIS SO THOSE CRUMASOMS CAN SEPARATE RY WE THINK ABOUT THE EGG WE REMEMBER THAT NORMAL FEMALE GENETICS FORTY SIX EXAX AND I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT IN THE EGG THAT THESE CRIMISOMES ARE LINED UP YOUR EGGS ARE FROZEN INSIDE YOUR BODY WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOUR EGGS ARE IN METAPHASE OF MYOSIS SO THAT'S WHEN CR METAPHAS CRIMSOMS MEAT IN THE MIDDLE AND THEY'RE HELD APART BY THESE MIATIC SPENDILES AND THIS IS WHY EGGS ARE SO STINK AND FRAGILE BECAUSE THEY'RE HELD LIKE THIS AND THOSE MYOTIC SPENDLES JUST ABSORB THE WEAR AND TERR OF YOUR LIFE BUT WHEN YOU USE THAT TRIGGER SHOT THAT L SURCH NATURALLY ORE THAT  C G AN A CYCHE THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE GITNG TO THAT FINAL SEPARATION INTO HALF THE EGGS OU HALF THOSE CREMASZOMSINTO THE EGG SO FOR BEULE LISTNING AS TO THINK ABOUT AM LIKE A ZIPPER WY I I PULLING A PART OF OF A ZIPPER THAT THEN YOU NOW HAVE THE THE CROMAZOLMS JUST ONE ONE YOU NOW HAVE HAVE THE CROMAZOMES BECAUSE WHY BECAUSE IN  SUCCESSFUL FREILIZATION THE OTHER CROMAZOMS ERE CAN TO COME FROM SPUN THISPAR MAN THAT'S WAY THIS PROCESS HAS MORE AIR THE OLDER YOU ARE AND THE LONGER YOUR CREMISEMS HAVE BEEN SITTING THERE BECAUSE THOSE SPENDLES ARE GOING TO BREAK DOWN AND WE'REGOING HAVE THAT INCREASE AN ANUPLODY LIKELY ALREADY SAID PURELY BECAUSE OF THE AMPACT CAN ASK A CUSHION ABOUT THAT SPIZER THE THING NOW WOULD BE THE RIGHT TIME TO ASK LANS HAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT A LOT OF THE DYNAMICS OF PULLING A PART OF THIS ZIPERA LIKE THING THESE CROMAZOMES AND THEN AM IS RELATED TO MITA CONDRIAL DIONE A BECAUE THER LOT OF MECHANICS WERE LITERALLY TALKING ABOUT AN EGX SPLITING ITSELF A YOU KNOW IN HALF I' GESS IT'S POWER HALT YEN THA THE MITACONDRE AND SO MITA CONDRIAL HEALTH IS A BIG TOPIC THESE DAYS A AND SO WEILL BE SURE TO TOUCH ON NUTRITION SUPPLEMENTATION AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT IMPACT MITA CONDRIAL HEALTH BUT I'VE HEARD OF A NEW PROCEDURE AM CALLED THREE PARENT AM I TE F WHERE THEY'RE TAKING BASEY THE DIONA FROM THE INTENDED MOM THE DIONE FROM INTENDED DAD AM AND THEN PUTTING IT INTO A A SURRIGAT LIKE A DONER EGG THAT IS WHERE THE D'ONA HAS BEEN SUCKED OUT AND THAND YOU KOW BECAUSE IT HAS HEALTH HEALTHY YEUR YOUNGER A MIGTA CONDRIAL D'ONE SO YOUR SENTIALLY A LESAY YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE IN THERE LIKE LE S A LATE THIRTIES EARLY FORTIES AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING SUCCESSFUL EMBRYOS OUR IMPLANTATIONS OR WHATEVER THINGS AREN'T WORKING THEY'LL TAKE THE D'ONA FROM MAMADAD IN THE AND THE THEYL MERGE IT WITH A THIRD PARENT AM INCAPSILLATION THAT THERE ARE CLINICS THAT DO THIS I KNOW THAT A A LOT OF THIS WAS I SHOULD BE NONE ANYSTERIN EUROPE UNTIL UNTIL RECENTLY AM MEXTICO OFFER EITHEIR PLACES MEXICO THAT DO THIS IN ENGLAND IT'S BEEN USE TO A SOLVE A MIGHT A CONDREAL DIS FUNCTION BUT IN THE OUASIS STILL NOT LEGAL IST AT RIGHT YES SO THE PURPOSE OF WHT YOU'R TOKING ABOUT ESSENTIALLY WE THINK ABOUT UTILIZING AM A DONER MIGHT A CONDRYOR DONOR AG THE POINT OF THAT TECHNOLOGY EXISTED TO HELP CURE MIHT ACONDRYALD DISEASEAS WHICH ARE A HUNDRED PER CENT FATAL AND SO YOU WOULD HAVE THIS SUBSET OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD BECAUSE IF YOURE THE MOM YOU ALWAYS PASS ON YOUR MIGHT A CONDRYA TO ALL OF THE OFFSPRING SO IF THERE IS DISEASE INHERENT IN YOUR MIGHT ACONDRYA EVERYBODY'S GOING TO GET IT N THESE ARE VERY SEVERE DISEASES SO THE IDEA OF THIS WAS FIRST TO SAY HOW CAN WE OVERCOME THS MIGHT A CONDRY A DISEASE AND GIVE UP PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY WHICH IT HAS DONE THAT RIGHT NOW TO IT WORKS WHEN DONE PROPERLY WHEN DONE PROPERLY ESPECILLY FOR THAT PURPOSE NOW THAT PURPOSE IS DISTINCT BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE AREN'T INFERTIL RIGHT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON WITHIN THEIRE MIGHT A CONDRYOLD DISEASE UTILIZING THAT TECHNOLOGY TO OVERCOME AGE ORLATED CHANGES IN THE AGS HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL YET ARE WE HOPEFUL THAT IT CAN WILL PEOPLE CHARGE YOU MONEY FOR IT IN CERTAIN PLACES YES BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE HITTING ON A REALLY IMPORTANT TOPIC IS THAT THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT OF EMBRYA RESEARCH IN THE UNITED STATES MAKES IT EXTREMELY HARD FOR US TO BE THE PIONEERS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY IN THIS SPACE AND THAT IS BECAUSE A LOT OF EUS ABOUT AN EMBRYO OR WENDA'S LIFE BEGAN THAT HAPPENS HERE IN THE UAS THAT RESULTS IN LIMITING THE AVAILABILITY AND THE POSSIBILITY OF DOING RESEARCH IN A MEANINGFUL WAY ON HUMAN EMBRYAS LIE AUSE IT WOULD REQUIRE THE DESTRUCTION OF A LOT OF OF AND IT WOULD ALSO IN YOU KNIGT LOOKED INTO THE SOLBIT AS IT FROM AN ECADEMIC PERSPECTIVE UM TO BE CLEAR UM IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THAT UM THE ABORTIONS BE PERFORMED DIFFERENT LY BECAUSE SEUCTION F WORSIONS DESTROY EMRYOS IN WAYS THAT EXTRACTION OF WORSIONS DON'T SO T AT IS A VERY CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC AND IT'S UM IT'S ONLY IT MAY BE RETURNED TO I AN EPISODE ABOUT STEMSELVES IN THE FUTURE OCINATING BECAUSE ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOOK AT IVIA WHOLL SEPARATE AS U IS THAT THERE'S MILLIONS OF EMBRYOS THAT PEOPLE ARE NO LONGER USING BECAUSE THEY HAVE HAD SUCCESS THEY AT EXTR EBRYOS THE BANK THEY GOT DEVORCE A VARIETY OF REASONS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO DONATE THEIR EMBRYOS TO SCIENCE FEEL LIKE HAY I DON'T WANT TO HAVE THIS EMBRYO AN PLANTED I DN'T WAN TO CARRY THIS CHILD BUT POTENTIALLY COULD SOMETHING GOOD OR COULD HELP ADVANCE THE FIELD BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY A TANGIBLE OPTION WHEN PEOPLE DO THOT WHAT IS ACTUALLY HOWPENING IS THEIR EMBRYOS ARE BEING UTILIZED TO TRAIN EMBRYOLOGISTS WHICH IS VALID RIGHT TO TEACH THEMHOW TO THA IN FREEZE AND BIOPSY AND DO DIFFERENT THING SO STILL USEFUL BUT IT'S NOT IN A MEANINGFUL WAY LIKE WE TO REALLY LOVE TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE TO ADVANCE THE SCIENCE ESPECIALLY FOR THESE EMBRYOS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED YET PEOPLE NO LONGER NEED THEM FOR FAMILY GROWTH TO WHAT HAPPENSTALL THE EMBRYOS THAT PEOPLE DON'T YOS FANTASTIC QUESTION RIGHT NOW THEY SIT IN STOREEDGE THIS EVER WELL THIS IS A NEW PROBLEM OCH IVIAF IS ONLY FORTY ISH YEARS OLD EMBRYO FREEZING ALONE WRITE THE FIRST IVIA WE HAVING GONE TO TH PROCESS WOT THE FIRST IVIA BABY THERE'S NO EFASAH ELA TO STIMULA MORE OF THE EGGS OUTSIDE THE VAULT TO GROW SO THEY FOLLOWED THE SINGLE POLICAL AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE PROCEDURE WHICH WE DO NOW WHICH IS AMENIBLY IN FASIVE PROCEDURE TO EXTRACT EGS WE GO VAGINALLY WITH A NEEDLE ATTACHED TO THE ULTRASOUND AND WE ENTER INTO EACH POLICAL AND WE DRAIN IT THE VERY FIRST IVIA YOU FOLLOWED ONE POLICAL AND YOU WEN AN ABDOMINABLY WITH A SURGERY TO GET PUT THAT NEEDLE INTO THE PHOLICAL AND DRAIN IT OUT AND GIVE THAT JUST ONE AGED CHANCE AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS NO EMBRYO FREEZING ORIGINALLY SO THE FIELD IS STILL RATHER YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THIS AND AS TECHNOLEGY RAPIDLY IMPROVES WE SEE THINGS LIKE BETTER SUCCESSORATES WITH FREEZING AND THAWING EMRYOS BETTER PROCESS OF GETTING MORE EMBRYOS TO GROW BUT NOW WE'VE A LOT OF EMRYOS IN STORAGE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE USE I PERSONALLY TELL PEOPLE YOU SHOULD KEEP YOUR EMBRYOS YOU SHOULD PAY THE STORAGE FY UNTIL NO MATTER WHAT THE WORST THING ON PLANET ERTH HAPPENS TO YOU YOU'RE DONE HAVING CHILDREN BECAUSE SADLY I LIVE IN A SPECTRUM WITH MY FIELD WHERE I FEE LOT OF SADNESS AND PEOPLE WHO MAY BE LEFT LOST A CHILD SOMETHING ELSE HAS HAPPENED AND THEY HAVE MAY BE A SIBLINE WHO THEY FEEL THEY REALLY WANT TO GIVE THI SIBLING CHILD THE CHANCE TO BE A SIBILING AGAIN AND OFTEN YOU'RE MUCH OLDER WHEN YOU'R EXPERIENCING THUS AND IF YOU AD HAT EMBRYOS FROZEN THAT YOU COULD A USE BUT YOU'VE GOT RID OF THEM YOU AN BE REALLY UPSET IF YOU FIND YOURSELF IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE SO I  SAY YOU SHOULD SAVE THEM UNTIL YOU KNOW THAT YOUD ARE NOT GOING TO NEED THEM AND THEN WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THEM MOST PEOPLE JUST DISCARD THEM SOME PEOPLE WILL DON'T ATE THEM TO LABS WHICH IS CALLED FOR RESEARCH BUT MOSTLY IT'S FER MBRYOLOGIST TRAINING  YOU'RE BETTER DETE WHICH IS ALSO IMPORTANT AM BUT MBRYODONATIONS A NEW THING SO BEING ABLE TO JUST LIKE WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO DON'T ATE SPERM AND DON'T ATE EG EMBRYO DONATION IS THE NEXT EVOLUTION OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW MORE PEOPLE TO BECOME PARENTS SO LITTLE BIT OF THE WILD WEST PEOPLE FINDING PEOPLE AND FACE BOT GROUPS AND CONNECTING AS THIS WHOLE OTHER DYNAMIC WHEN IT COMES TO OU WILL WE CALL THIRD PARTY REPRODUCTION OR YOU KNOW WHAT D YOU DO WITH NO OWNERS AN THINGS LIKE THAT BUT IT'S A VERY INTERESTING CONCEPT SO THIS PROBLEM IS EMERGING AS THE TECHNOLOGIES GETTING BETTER I'M REALIZING NOW UM REMEMBERING RATHER THAT WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE IN GRADUATE SCHOOL YOU'D SEE THESE UM ADDS IN THE STUDENT PAPER E FREGLER FOR EGDOWNERS AND SPIRMED OWNERS UM SPIRMER GENERATE THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPEND SO IT'S A KIND OF LESS CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE BUT THIS IS NOW NOT ALLOWED MOST PLACES TO ADVERTISE FOR FREGDOWNERS ON COLLEGE CANPASSES THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING UM THESE EGDONERS WERE OFTEN PAID WHATEVER WHATEVER THEY WERE PAID IM I GUESS SAY WAS REASONABLE MOUNTS OR DOCTCAUSE I DONT DON'T RECALL WHAT THEY WERE PAID NEVERYONE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE DIFFERENT BUT THE ARGUMENT THAT MOST PEOPLE USE AGAINST THIS IS OH THESE THESE PEOPLE ARE GIVING UP EGS THAT THEY COULD OTHERWISE USE BUT WE NOW KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE SO UM YOUVE ANY KNOWLEDGIST IS LIKE WAS THE UM THE RATIONAL FOR FOR LIMITING THE RECRUITMENT OF EGDOWNERS UM AND WY I'M NOT ARGUING FOR AGAINST I JUST I IT'S NO LONGER SUPPORTED BASE ON WHAT YOU SAID BY THE U BY THE ARGUMENT THAT THEYR LOSING EGGS THEY WOULD OTHERWISE I WON'T BE ABLE TO SOME OTHERS ABOUT PROPER INFORM CONSENT ESPECIALLY AT AN AGE WERE THE FINANTIAL IN SENTIVE CAN BE VERY PERSUASIVE WITHOUT UNDER STANDINE MAXEM NOT THAT IT HARMS YOUR FERTILITY LATER BUT THAT YOUARE GOING TO HIVE GENETIC CHILDREN OUT THERE AND YOU MIGHT POTENTIALLY AND WE ARE SEEN THIS NOW WE DON'T KNOW IF YOU INDIVIDUALLY WILL HAVE INFERTILITY FOR A VARIETY OF RESONS CAUSE YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO HAVE A FAMILY UNTIL MUCH LATER BUT THE SAME T CONCERN DOESN'T SEEM TO EXIST FOR MEN WHO ARE DONATING SPIRM LE MEAN IXSUD THERE'S THE WHOLE DONER CONCEIVE COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE AE REALY TALKING ABOUT PUTTING NEW RESTRICTIONS ON WILL YOU SPIRM DONATION FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE SPERM DOWNERS WHO HAVE HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN HUNDREDS RIGHT THEY'ARE THESE SIBLING PODS BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SO UNLIMITED AND SPIRM BANKS ARE A BUSINESS THAT WORK TO MAKE MONEY AND THEY MAKE MONEY BY SELLING MORE SPIRM BUT THAT'S NOT HEALTHY ONE FOR POPULATION YOU NEED GENETIC DIVERSITY BUT ALSO IT'S NOT HEALTHY NECESSARILY FOR ONE PERSON HAVE ALL THES HALF SIBLINGS AND TO JUST NOT KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO RUN INTO SOMEBODY WHO COULD POTENTIALLY BE YERE SIBLING IS THAT THIS GUY AT THE BAR THAT YOU LIKE DO YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT IF YOUR DONER CONCEIVED SO WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SPIRM BANKS FINELY SERT TO REAL BACK AND PUT LIMITATIONS ON HOW MANY FAMILIES TOTAL CHILDREN'S TALFRAY BECAUSE ONE FAMILY MIGHT HAVE A CHILD AND YOU WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SIBLING CHILDREN BUT AT LEAST FOR HOW MANY FAMILIES THAT THAT DONER CAN CONTRIBUTE TO AND WE'RE SEEN SPIRM DOWNERS DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT NOW THERE'S NO ANONYMOUS DONATION WE CAN ACT LIKE ANONYMOUS DONATION EXISTS MEANING IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED AT THE TIME THAT SOMEBODY'S BEAUTILIZING THIS SPIRM BUT WITH YOU KNOW DIRECT TO CONSUMER TESTING FOR GENETICS LIKE TWENTY THREE AND ME AND ANCESTORY PEOPLE ARE BEING CONNECTED WITH THEIR SPIRM DONERS WITH THEIR EGGDONERS WITH THEIR SIBLING PODS AND WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT TECHNOLOGYES ONLY GOING TO IMPROVE OF TIME SO WHAT PEOPLE DO FOR MONEY ESPECIALLY WHN THEY'RE YOUNG I THINK WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE POTENTIAL RAMIFICATIONS AND I DON'T WANT TO ACT LIKE SPIRM DONATION AR EGDONATION ARE BAD THEY GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME PARENTS THAT OTHERWISE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO AND THAT IS A LOVELY AND A BEAUTIFUL GIFT BUT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MIGHT MEAN AND HOW THAT MIGHT IMPACT YOUR OWN POTENTIAL CHILDREN LATER TO TO KNOW THAT THER HAVE GENETIC HALF SIBLINGS OUT THERE EGDONATION PEOPLE DO GET COMPENSATED MUCH BETTER THAN SPIRM DONATION THERE CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE HARD TO FIND THAT COMPENSATED EVEN MORE SO AND CERTAINLYOU KNO ETHNICITIES DOCTOR DEGREES AND THINGS LIKE THAT WERE SOMEBODY CAN RENLY PAY FOR THEIR EDUCATION BY DON'TEATING THEIR EGGS IT'S A IT'S A DELIMMA BECAUSE WHAT YOU'D LOVE TO SAY IT'S LIKE FREESOME EGGS FOR YOU TOO IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT YOU'RE AT THE PERFECT AGE TO FREEZE YOUR OWN EGGS AND THERE'S BEEN STRATEGIES TO TRAY TO MITIGATE THIS AND I DON'T I GET OFF TOO MUCH ON A TANGENT BUT IT'S A REALLY FINE LINE THAT YOU WALK WITH WHAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND SO THERE IS A COMPANY AND I WON'T NAME THEM BUT THEY ARE PROMOTING THAT YOUNG WOMEN DON'T ATE THEIR EGGS AND THEY WILL FREEZE HALF OF THEM FOR YOU AND HALF OF THEM WILL GO AND BECOME DONAR EGGS INTERESTING BUSINESS MORDEL THAT WOULD CAN SEE THE PREDENTIAL EFFICALCONCER SO I THINK ETHICALLY THIS SOUNDS GOOD CAUSE YOU GET TO FREE SOME EGGS BUT I THINK MORE PEOPLE WILL DON'T AT EGGS THAN OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE FOR SOME OF THE REASONS WE PREVIOUSLY STATED AND I ALSO THINK YOU WOULD GET MORE MONEY BY SIMPLY DON'T EATING YOUR EGGS AND IN TURNING AROUND AN PAYING FOR US ROUND OF FREEZING YOUR OWN EGGS YOU WOULD GET PAID MORE AND YOU'D HAVE MORE EGGS BECAUSE ONE OF THE ISSUES IS DO DO YOU NOW FALSELY BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH EGGS IN THE BANK BECAUSE YOU DID THIS SPLIT BUT YOU DON'T REALLY HALVE ENOUGH BECAUSE WE ALREADY WALK THROUGH THE MATH AT TWENTY EGGS DOESN'T REALLY RESULT IN SUCH A HIGH PROBABILITY OF HAVING A MOULTY CHILD FAMILY SO YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF ETHICAL DEBATE IN GAMMING AND EMRYODONATION IT DEPHNY IS THE WILD WEST AND THERE'S A UNCHARTED TERRITORY EVEN AN EMBRYODONATION THERE'S PLACES WHO ARE VERY UNETHICAL ABOUT IT WHO WILL ONLY ALLOW PEOPLE TO HAVE EMBRYOS IF THEY ARE HEADER SEXUAL BEEN MARRIED FOR THREE YEARS MAKE A CERTAIN INCOME SUBMIT TO A HOME STUDY YET THEY LET THE PEOPLE HAVE NO SAY OVER THE MBRYOS THAT ARE TRANSFERRED BE IT HOW MANY WHAT STAGE WHAT QUALITY AND THEY ARE TAKING EVILS MONEY AND PUTTING TERRIBLE EMBRYOS INSIDE OF THEM AND REALLY WASTING THEIR RESOURCES WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN USED IN ANOTHER WAY AT THE DANGERS OF PROPHETIZATION OF BIOLOGY RIGHT AND TAI MEAN TACT ENTERING SPACES IS AMAZING BUT ALSO TECHNOLOGY STARTS TO ADVANCE BEFORE STUDIES RAT TAGISGON A BECOME HAS MORE FINANCE BACKING THAN WE SEE SCIENTIFIC STUDIESGEP I FEEL LIKE ONE OF THE MAJOR QUESTIONS OUT THERE IS WHETHER OR NOT IV F BABIES  CALL THEM THERE HOW THE HIRE INCIDENTS OF THINGS LIKE AMSPECTRUM CONDITIONS OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES LET'S CALL THEM AND I'M NOT TRYING TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECTURE BUT OUNITHING NOWT IS THE WORD A DISORDER IT HAS TO BE LIKE REALLY CAREFULLY EXAMINED WHEN CONSIDERING ANY A NEUROLOGIC A AN PSYCHIATRIC AM SITUATION AM BE WE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS ON THIS PODCAST BEFORE BUT BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WONDERING JUST TO BE TO BE DIRECT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WONDERING DO MORE IV F BABIES HAVE AUTISM AM THEN NOT IVEF BABIES IS THIS THE GOOD QUESTION AND IT'S CHANGED OVER TIME AN COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS ANYTHING THIS IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND SO IF WE JUST THINK ABOUT THE HORMONAL ENVIRONMENT WITH NATURAL CONCEPTION AND YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A PIK ESTRGON LET THEY HAVE TWO HUNDRED SOMETHING YOU HAVE PROJUSTRON BEING MADE THE PLECENTA IS EMPLANTING AND WHAT IS THE MAIN DIF FERENDS WITH IVI F BABIES AND A LOT OF IT HAS BEEN TIED BACK TO THE YOU DERENT ENVIRONMENT ESPECIALLY IN WHAT WE CALL FRESH EMBRYO TRANSFERS WHICH IS REALLY NOT A COMMON PRACTICE ANY MORE SO IN A FRESH AMBRYO TRANSFER I NOTING THE EGGS IUT OF YOUR BODY FERTILIZE THEM IN THE LAB AND GRAB OUT EMBRYOS AND THEN I'M GOING TO PUT THE BEST EMBRYO BACK IN YOUR BODY FIVE DAYS LATER AT THE NATURAL TIME OF T N PLANTATION AND IF WE REAWIND THE CLOCK THAT'S HOW IVIEV WAS DONE RIGHT WHEN YOU COULDN'T FREES AND BRIOS VERY WELL WHEN THEY DIDN'T SURVIVE AND YOU'D A LOTS OF IMBRYOS INSIE BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T SURVIVE AND THUS THE EARLY DAYS OF IVIAF WHEN YOU SAW A LOT OF MULTIPLES A LOT HIGH ORDER MULTIPLES AND OF COURSE MULTIPLES HAVE THEIR OWNDISTINCT ISSUES THAT PUT THEM AT HIGHER RISK FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS AND ISSUES WITH DEVELOPMENT AND ARTHREST IN GENERAL RA THERE THE'RE COMTO BE FAR THE'RE COMMONLY REFER TO IS AS DISORDERS I JUST THINK A AROUND AUTISM IN PARTICULAR THAT THERE'S T THERE'S A CAMP A GROWING CAM AOUT THERE THAT UM WHAT WANT IT REFERRED YOU DIFFERENTLY WE WE'D COVERED THIS A ANYTIME THIS COMES UP I BRING UP BOTH JUST A HIGH LIKE THE FACT THAT YES WE ARE AWARE AND SENSITIVE TO THAT EMERGING ISSUE RIGHT NOW UNFORTUNATELY FOR SAKE OF CONVERSATION THERE'S NO NEW NOMIN CLATUR SO WE COAND EASILY GET UM BI'LL GN ON DOWN AND IN THE IN THE ATTEMPT TO TRYIN LIKE YOU KNOW AM SMOOTH OVER EVERYTHING WITH EVERYBODY AND AND T AS A CONSEQUENCE CONFUSE EVERYBODY SO I THINK WE'LL GO FOR CLARITY FORWARD WITH THE UNDERSCHAING THAT THE NOMAN CLATURE S CHANGING CANE SAY I'LL CALLISM ANY MORE I BECAUSE IT'S I'LL CALL USE DISORDER AND I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT  LOT PEOPLE WONDERIF THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS AND THIS CONFUSE AGAIN WE WENT OUTHEMPLIFY SIEND RITER PEOPLE LECLY SO FEEL FREE EM TO WHEN WE FIRST FOR DOING IVIA WE'RE PUTTING EMBRYO'S BACK IN EXTREMELY UNNATURAL ENVIRONMENT IF YOU HAVE TWENTY EGS GROWLING AND EACH UG MAKES TWO HUNDRED PEGAGRAMS OF ESTRGEN SUDDENLY NOW YOU HAVE THESE EXTREMELY HIGH SUPERPHYSIOLOGIC ESTRS AND LEVELS HIGHER PRODESTERON LEVELS BECAUSE HEREIS MORE CORPUS LUDIUMS AND THIS ENVIRONMENT IS NOT THE NORMAL FOR HOW THE PLECANTI WOULD INVADE IN TO THAT MATERNAL BLOOD CIRCULATURE AND A LOT OF THESE ISSUES THAT ARE COMMONLY ASSOCIATED BECAME SO BECAUSE OF PLECANTALISUES SO A LOT OF THINGS LIKE GROWTH RESTRUCTION SMALL FORTESATIONAL AGE PRETERNBERTH WHICH FURTHER PUT YOU AT RISK FOR OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FRESH TRAMP SFERS THE FEEL THIS CHANGE WE DO LOT OF FROZEN AND BRYO TRANSFERS ON A LOT OF IT FOR THIS REASON WE SEE HUGE IMPROVEMENT IN NEANITAL OUTCOMES WHEN YOU BLEED OFF THAT HIGH HORMONAL OUDERAN ENVIRONMENT AND THEN RE GROW THE LINING OF THE UTERES AND A HORMONAL LEVEL THAT'S MORE NATURAL AND THEN TRANSFER THE EMBRYO AND WE SEE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BEETLE OUTCOMES SO THAT'S FANTASTIC AS FAR AS LOOKING AT THE CHANGE OVER THE FIELD BUT OF COURSE IF YOU TAKE ALL IVIA BABIES OVER ALL TIME IT'S A LITTL MERKY BECAUSE YOU HAVE MODERN PRACTICE AND OLD PRACTICE WE ALSO KNOW THAT INFERTILITY PEOPLE IF YOU GET DIAGNOS WITH IN FERTILITY SO YOU'RE UNDER AGE THIRTY FIVE AND YOU TRIETY AT PREGNANT WITH REGULAR PERIODS FOR ONE YEAR AND HAVE NOT HAD SUCCESS OR YOU ARE THIRTY FIVE AND OLDER AND YOU'VE TRIED FOR SIX MONTHS AND YOU'VE NOT HAD SUCCESS YOU MEET THE MEDICAL DEFINITION FOR IN FERTILITY WHEN THAT HAPPENS YOU NOW STATISTICALLY REGARDLESS IF YOU GET PREGNANT NATURALLY IN THE NEXT MONTH OR YOU DO IVEOG YOU HAVE ONE PERCENT HIGHER CHANCE OF BERTH TEFFECTS AND YOU HAVE A SLIGHTLY HIGHER CHANCE OF DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS SO IS IT MORE POPULATION PASE VERSES PROCED YOUR BASE AND THERE'S PROBABLY SOMETHING TO THAT TO UNDERLYING A LOT OF POTENTIALLY WHAT GOES IN OR WHAT CAN CAUSE AND FERTILITY WHEN IT COMES TO YOU KNOW QUALITY OF EX OR SPERM OR YOU DON'T ENVIRONMENT OR THINGS THAT WERE STILL LEARNING ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO AUTISM SPACIFICALLY THEN NUMBER ONE STRONG AST ASSOCIATION WE HAVE IS ADVANCE PATERNAL AGE SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PEOPLE AND THE MALE SPERM COMES FROM AN EJACULATION AFTER AGE FIFTY THAT ONE DOES HAVE THE HIGHEST SIGNIFICANCE ASSOCIATED WITH OTISM AND ALSO WITH SOME OTHER VERY INTERESTING OT ISAMO DOMINANT DISORDERS SO WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE ADVANCE PATRNAL AGE LIKELY ALTHOUGH IT DOES GET SO MUCH LESS ATTENTION THAN WHAT WE CALL ADVANCE MATERNAL AGE OR BEING OVER AGE S THIRTY FIVE AND A WOMAN AND TNOT AS PURELY BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCE AS AND THE SPIRM AND THE AG ENVIRONMEN AND HOW THEIR QUALITIES AN PACKFALL THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER I THINK UM TREALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR THAT A BECAUSE YOU A THAT THE LOWER OUT THERE IS THAT I VE A HIRE INCENCE OF ABOTISM N I V F BABIES BUT SOMETHING A GOOD PERCENTAGE OF THOSE UM CALD BE BECAUSE OF AGE RELATED FACTORS UM AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGY RELATED FACTORS THAT U AND THAT THE TEHNOLOGY IS GETTING BETTER ALL THE TIME UM IF I UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY A WE DIDN'T COMPLETE THE DISCUSSION OF A I V F AND I WANT TO DO THAT TALK XE IN A FEW OTHER THINGS I KNOW THAT THAT STUFFLING YOUR WHEEL HOUSE BEFORE WE DO THAT CAN WE INJECT A SUBCONVERSATION UM AROUND NISS BECAUSE A I NEGLECTED TO BRING THE SUPPER EARLIER AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT IC CURIOSITY ABOUT THIS AND THEM WILL AND THEN WILL A FINISH OFF I THE F CAN WE DO THAT YOU SOR OF APPAUSE IN THE IVIESO THE EXROUT THE FROZEN SPIRMS OUT SFROZEN OR MAYBE THEY CAN PUT AM LIVESPERM ON A NONFROZE EXCUSE ME A SPERM DIRECTLY ON TO THOSE UNFROZEN EGGS WILL PAUSE THEIR INTERMISSION FOR THOSE A POTENTIAL EMBRYOS A AND TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE BEEN UM VERY OPEN ABOUT WHICH IS UM AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOT FRANKLY IN YOUR PROFESSION S I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS WHICH IS NUTRITION AND SUPPLEMENTATION TO OPTIMIZE THE THE HEALTH OF A EQUALITY AND NOT JUST FOR PEOPLE WANT TO GET PREGNANT BUT FOR BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT FERTILITY IS APROXY FOR OVER ALL HEALTH SO I MEAN R OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD EAT AND NOT EAT UM THINGS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD SUPPLEMENT AND NOT SUPPLEMENT IN ORDER TO UM OPTIMIZE THEIR FERTILITY I MEAN THIS THE DEVILY AN INTEREST OF MIN MADE ALL MY FELLOWS SOPERES ERE CYCLES AROUND A KIND ABILITY AND NATURAL FERTILITY AND I THINK WE REALLY DO A DE SERVES BY HOW MADIZIN REALLY IS CATEGRIZED BY ORGANS THE STEMS BECAUSE WE ACK LIKE THINGS IN ONE PLACE DON'T IMPACT THE OTHER YOU RAY BUTIYOU HAVE A BODY AND YOUR BODY AND ESPECIALLY YOUR HORMONES CHANGE AND FLUCTUATE IN THEIR MEANT TO THEY ARE MEANT TO BE A DYNAMIC SYSTEM BUT THE WORLD AND THE ENVIRONMENT OF WHICH YOU ARE SUBJECTING YOUR BODY TO HAS PROVEN CHANGES ON BOTH HORMENTAL FUNCTION AND ALSO WHEN IT COMES TO EGG AND SPIRM QUALITY AND SO IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO JUST ONCE TO LIVE YOUR HEALTHIEST LIFE AND HAVE YOUR MOST REGULAR PERIODS AND HAVE YOUR HORMONES AS WELL BALANCED AS THEY CAN BE FOR A LACK OF A BETTER WORD WILL JUST SAY THAT THAT MEANS THAT THEIR FUNCTION ENORMALLY THEN PAINATTENTION TO THE THINGS THAT YOU DO ARE REALLY IMPORTANT AND SO I KNOW THIS IS A BIG ONE FOR YOU SLEEP IS PROBABLY THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT PEOPLE DON'T DO THAT DOESN'T PACK THEIR REPRODUCTIVE ORMONE SYSTEM AND THERE FOR CAN IMPACT AGAINSFIRM QUALITY BECAUSE SLEEP AS WHEN YOU HAVE CELLULAR REPAIR AND WHEN YOU CAN DROP YOUR INFLAMMATION LEVELS WE KNOW THAT INFLAMMATION IS JUST TOXIC TO EX ANSPIRM IT IS THE INFLAMMATORY ENVIRONMENT IS NOT IDEAL FOR CONCEPTION AND THEN FOR A FEMALE YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE YOUR EGQUALITY BUT YOU ALSO HAVE HOW INFLAMMATION OR WHAT YOURE EXPOSED TO IMPACTS YOUR UTURAN ENVIRONMENT SO YOU HAVE A A TOFOLD SITUATION HERE SO NONE OF THIS SHOULD BE SHOCKING NEWS WHEN IT COMES TO NUTRITION BUT IT IS NOT TALKED ABOUT ENOUGH YOUR RIGHT DECREASING INFLAMMATION BY THE FOODS THAT WE PUT IN OUR BODY IS CONSISTENTLY SHOWN WITH AN IMPROVEMENT IN FACCUNDABILITY AN IMPROVEMENT AN ODULATION IN IMPROVEMENT IN SUCCESS WITH IVIA AND A DECREASE IN MISCARRIAGE RITE HUGE STUDIES HAVE LOOKED AT THESE NOW THE VICCAVIATE IS THAT NEU TRSON SUDIES ARE SUPERHARD BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO CONSUME FLAX FOR EXAMPLE TEND TO HAVE OTHER GOOD HEALTH BEHAVIORS THAT SOMETIMES MAKE IT HARD TO IDENTIFY WHAT THLACKS DID VERSES THEIR GENERAL HEALTH VERSES SOMEBODY WHO EATS FAST FOOD EVERY DAY ESO NUTRITION STUDIES TIM TO BE OBSERVATIONAL AND FERTILITDIES TUDIES ARE REALLY HARD TOO BECAUSE WHAT IN POINT AR YOU USING IS IT GETTING PREGNANT IS AT LIVE BIRTH ARE YOU LOOKING AT IVEA F ARE YOU LOOKING AT NATURAL FERTILITY AND WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT OVERLAP THAT MAKES BOTH OF THESE A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT AND SO THER'RE ALL COHORT BASE OR POPULATION BY STUDIES WHERE YOU ANALYZE HOW PEOPLE PERFORM WHEN IT COMES TO FERTILITY TREATMENTS OR GETTING PREGNANT NATURALLY BASED ON THEIR EXPOSURES TO CERTAIN THINGS DIETS HIGH AND FRUITS AND VEGETABLES ARE GOOD FOR YOU RIHT FIBER ANY OCCIDENTS FRUIT IS NOT BAD FRUIT GOT THIS REALLY BAD REPUTATION O Y LEVE FRUIT TOO BUT PEOPLE THINK THAT IT HAS SUGAR AND THAT ITS BAD FOR YOU ISFRUOS GOOD IS KNO IS NOT THAT TYPE OF SUGAR IS NOT BAD FOR YOU IF WE CAN JUST AGREE ON THE FACT THAT FRUIT HAS A LOT OF NUTRITIONAL BENEFIT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO VIDAMENDS AND ANY OCCIDENTS THAT CAN BE EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL AN DECREASING INFLAMATION GRAIN SO WHOLE GRAINS ESPECIALLY THAT YOUR BODY IN A PROVIDE A LOT OF GREAT FIBERE SO COURSE IF YOU AVSILIACER YOUR GLUTEN AN TOLERANT YOUR DIFFERENT CATEGORY BUT THERE WAS SO MUCH FOCUS ON QITO AND PEOPLE ELIMINATING GRAINS IS A FOOD GROUP OVER ALL AND EVEN THOUGH THAT MIGHT BE UTILIZED AN A DIETARY STRATEGY TO LOSE WEIGHT AND LOSING WEIGHT CAN IMPROUVE FERTILITY LIKELY BECAUSE OF INFLAMMATION BEING THE PRIMARY DRIVER BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT EVEN IN STUDIES WHERE I TAKE DONER EGGS AND I TRANSFER THAT EMBRYO INTO SOMEBODY WHO'SE OVERWEIGH THEY HAVE LOWER ODS OF SUCCESS THAN IF THEY WERE A NORMAL BEAMI SO WE CAN'T ACT LIKE THAT CAUSATION IS JUST ON EG QUALITY FROM OBE CITY RIGHT THERE'S ALSO SOME INFLAMMATIONS AND INFLAMATORY CHANGES THAT INPACT THE BODIES ABILITY OR DESIRE TO ALLOW AN EMBRYO TO IMPLANT SO RUITS FEDGIES WHOLE GRAINS ARE ALL GOUD INTERESTINGLY YOU KNOW DAIRY DARRY TENDS TO BE HOQUET AND MOST STUDIES BUT WHAT WE DO SEE IS THAT IF YOU'RE GUNAHOV DAIRY HAVE WHOLE OF THE REAL THING THE PROCESS DARY THE SKIM MILK THAT ACTUALLY DECREASES YOUAR FERTILITY AND LIKELY BECAUSE THE PROCESSING TO MAKE IT STILL LOOK LIKE MILK WHEN YOU TAKE OUT THE FAT IS ADDIN AN THINGS THAT ARE UNNATURAL POTENTIALLY IMPACTING YOUR FERTILITY I DON'T DRINK MILK AMEWERE BUT WENIS A TEAATRINK HALF AN HALF ON THAT RCCOMMENING AN CAU THAT MEROUSEES GAINTY MAGE YOUR O YOU ARE TYING A BOOK AND ALL NOW I JUST COULD AFFORD TO I WASN'T TRY AT THAT AGE O I WASN'T TRYING TO AT ALL BUT AM IT WAS JUT DELICIOUS UM BUT SO CHEOSES UM HOL A FULL FAT MILK YOU GAY NA AOR NAW BUT DON'T DON'T CHOOSE THE SKIM ONE CHOOSE THO ACTUAL ONE THAT COMES WITH SOME OF THE MILK FAT FAT IS NOT BAD FOR YOU THERE'S ALSO THIS RATE WE'RE HOPULY WERE GETTING AWAY FROM IT HT THERE'S BEEN SUCH A LOW FAT CRAZE ARE THIS REAL ATTENTION THAT FAT IS SO BAD BUT FAT COMES IN SO MANY IMPORTANT FORMS AVACATOS AN OIL IS A NUTS DARRY MEAT FAT AND COLLESTERAL ARE THE BACKBONE FOR ALL HARMONS FRAIT SO YOU NEAD AT IN ORDER FOR YOUR BODY TO MAKE THE ASTERGEON AND PROGEST AROUND THAT IT NEEDS TO ALLOW THIS WHOLE PROCESS TO HAPPEN AND SO THERE'S THIS IDEA THAT THOSE ARE BAD FOR YOU THERE JUST REALLY NOT SO HEALTHY FATS WHOLE GRAINS FRUITS FEDGIES AND WHAT ABOUT PROATINGS O MEATS BECAUSE I THINK WITHIN THOSE CATEGORES NOT I WOT BE THIN OF SUSTAINABLY YOU KNOW LIKE RASED MEATS ITIFIF POSSIBLE IT SOME PNEOPLE CHOSE NOT EET ME BUT FISH EGGS UM LOVE IT ALL OCET SO LET'S JUST GO THROUGH THE MEATS AND THE MYTH AND THE FACT SO WILL DO TOFOOT SO THERE'S ASPIK ASSHUE THAT I TOFO HAS SOY AND THAT TOO MUCH SOY CAN BE BAD BECAUSE S WEY CAN BE A FIDO ASTRAGON TOPO DOES NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACT FERTILITY EVEN IN MEN IN FACT IT CAN IMPROVE IT BECAUSE IT DOES HAVE SOME ANY OCCIDENT LIKE PROPERTIES LOTS OF IRON WHEN IT COMES TO FISH FISH ARE FANTASTIC SOURCES OF HEALTHY FACTS AND A MEGA THRE FADIASES WHICH ARE FERY CRUCIAL IN THE REPRODUCTIVE PROCESS WE DO WORRY ABOUT IF YOU ARE PRAGNANT HAVING TOO MUCH FISH AND OVER EXPOSURE TO MERCURY AND HOW THAT CAN IMPACT FEEDL BRAIN DEVELOPMENT SO THE GENERAL RECOMMENDATION IS THREE SERVINGS PER WEEK THAT DOES OTMY GEST A SERVING IS LIKE FORTO SIX AN AY IS A GRAT A REAL HUMAN NG ALS YOU KNOW REALL E THAN IS YTHAT EATS YOU KNO YOU KNOW SIXT EIGHT ALNCEIS ARI AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU THAT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO GET PRAGNANT WITH THE IDEA WE DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU'RE  GOING TO BE PRAGNANT IF YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THINGS LIKE UG FREEZING ARE IVEOUGH AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE PRAGNANT I WOULDN'T FEEL TIT YOU HAVE TO RESTRICT YOURSELF ON THE CONSUMPTION OF SEA FOOD DURING THOSE TIME PERIODS WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT PRAGNANT YAT BECAUSE REALLY THE CONCERN IS ABOUT THAT MERCURY AND WHAT IT COULD PETENTIALLY DO TO A FEEDAL BRAIN AN ROSSY FOOD CORRECT NO SUSHE O SUSHIE WELL WHEN YOU'RE PREGNANT CORRECT AND NOT'S MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE RISK OF INFECTIOS DISEASE THAT CAN CAUSE YOU KNOW SEVERE BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER ISSUE IS EDUINTUPE I DON'T KNOW I DON'T LIVE THERE THEY PROY LAUGH AT THIS THEY PROBABLY DO LA RIDA E AI  T AT WEN A WHOSE HOS AM A IN PREGNANT IN JUPEN EVERY CHILT TELL E EERE CONCEIVED IN GUPEN TELL US DON'T TELL US THE STORY THE CONCEPTION LIKE TO BUT TELLS TELLS A D YEF SUSHIE OVER ALL MEAT IS A REALLY BROAD CATEGORY AND STUDIES STUDY IT DIFFERENTLY LIKE AS AT ALL MEAT ARE YOU DISTINGUISHING NOW RED MEAT AND CHAKAN ARE YOU PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER ME OBVIOUSLY I THINK WE CAN ALL COME TO THE AGREEMENT THAT PROCESS MEATS ARE NOT GOOD FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT REASONS AN ADDITION TO BEING CERSON AT JENNEC THOSE TALKSENS DO NEGATIVELY IMPACT FORTELLING NOW SO DELLY MEAT NO ONE SO YE BUT IN SPECIFICALLY THOSE THINGS LIKE THE BAGAN AND THE P LIKE THE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY HIGHLY PROSY HOT DOGS SORRY THE FORTH OF DELYHOTDOG PICNIC BUT THOSE THINGS REALLY DO NOT PROVIDE NUTRITIONAL ADVANTAGES AND ONLY HARM ESPECIALLY THEN EN WE HAVE RED MEAT FOR THE MOST PART RED MEAT WHEN ISOLATED INDIVIDUALLY AND MOST CIRCUMSTANCES IN MODERATION TENDS TO BE FINE I USUALLY TELL MY PATIENTE I WENT TE MEAT A PLANT FORWARD DIET THAT DOESN'T MEAN NO MEAT BUT I SAY LOOK AT YOURE MEAT SERVINGS I DON'T WANT IT RED MEAT EVERY SINGLE DAY BECAUSE THERE WAS A STUDY LOOKING AT IVEOUG AND LOOKING AT EMBRYOS AND THE MORE SERVINGS A LOT OF NUTRITIONAL STUDIES BASE THINGS ON CORTILES SO WHO EATS THE LOWEST THAN THE SECOND MOST AND THE THIRD MOST N THE TOPMOST AND PEOPLE WHO ATE IN THAT TOP CORTILE OF RED MEAT HAD LOWER PROGRESSION OF EMBRYOS THROUGH THE CULTURE SO LESS EMBRYOS THAT DEVELOPED LESS NORMAL EMBRYOS AND LOWER SUCCESSORATES AND WHAT DO E NOYTHING ABOUT T HOW THAT MEAT WAS A RYL WHICH I RNY WE DON LI LIKE HOGAT SIN WHICH S   OT LIKE GRASPEDSTAKE GRAT IS THADIES ARE NOT WONDERFUL BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY DON'T HOLD MERIT AND HELPING US GUIDE COUNSELLING BUT NOW THAT ONE WHO AS HOW MANY SERVINGS OF RED MEAT DO YOU EAT IN A WEEK RIT SO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW DOES THE REALLY ATHICALLY SORES THE GRASSPHAD YU THIS ENVIRONMENT WHICH WE FEEL LIKE IS MUCH LESS TALKSICK THAN POTENTIALLY LESS THEY LIKE A CATTLE FACTORY WHERE THE COWS ARE INJECTED WITH ALL SORTS OF THINGS IS THERE A DIFFERENCE AND HOW THOSE IMPACT YOUR REPRODUCTION PROBABLY RIGHT IF THIS COWS GETTING INJECTED WITH A LOT OF HORMONES WHY ARE WE THINKING THAT IT'S NOT IN PACTING THE MEAT THAT YOU ARE THEN INJUSTING INTO YOUR BODY I THINK OR IANCE CERTAINLY EM SUBSCRIBE TO THAT I DEA MY THING MOST OF THEM WHELL I MTHE NOTION THAT LIKE THE POLUTENENCE YOU BREATHE IN THE AIR SOMEHOW OR NOT THE THE EIR THAT YOU BREATHIN HER LONGSIS IS JUST LIKE COMPLETELYWY AND THE THE I YETLL FEEL THAT WA AND THEY HOLD STRONGLY TO THIS IDEA THAT IT IT CAN'T BE THIS THING THAT I LOVE THAT IS CAUSING THIS PROBLEM RIGHT THE DENIAL OF THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN WHAT WE PUT IN AND ON OUR BODY AND HOW IT IMPACTS ARE BODY'S FUNCTION IS REALLY STRONG AND SOME PEOPLE AND I THINK IT'S REALLY JUST LACK OF EDUCATION AND A WARENESS BECAUSE THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY FOR SO LONG DID NOT ADDRESS THESE FACTORS RIGHT YOUR DOCTOR NEVER TALKS TO BTO YOU ABOUT NUTRICIAN AND SO IT JUST BE CAME THIS IDEA THAT IT MUST NOT MATTER OTHERWISE YOUR DOCTOR WOULD TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT I THINK SUGARIS THE LASTING EJEST AT MENTION BUT ADDID SUGAR AND ARTIFICIAL SUGARS ARE BAD FOR YOU ARTIFICIAL SUGARS ARTIFICIAL SUGARS TOO O EVUTIN STEVIOS REPLINT BAS OR A LOWCALORY SREESEREVIA IT SELF HASN'T BEEN STUDIED AS MUCH AS THE OTHER ONES THINGS LIKE SWEETEN LO  ACNOLEGES BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THEY INTERFETE THAT CAUSE INFLAMMATION INSIDE THE BODY AND THEN THEY ALSO CAUS CAN CAUSISTRUST REACTION AND THEY CAN CAUSE HIE REATS A MISCARRIAGE WHEN YOU AN TAKE MORE SUGAR AND ARTIFICIAL SUGAR SO THAT'S A LOT TO WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND AND I SEE THE SAME THING TO EVERY PATION ONE CAKE ONE THIS ONE HOT DOG ING THOSE THINGS INDIVIDUALLY ARE NOT CAN O MAKE A DIFFERENCS RIGHT IT'S THE CHOICES THAT YOU MAKE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT ARE GOING TO SET YOU UP TO BE YOUR HEALTHY SELF OR NOT AND SO YOU SHOULD MAKE TAICES IN LING WITH HOW YOU WANT TO TREAT YOURSELF YOU WANT TO BE IN YOUR BEST HEALTH YOU WANT YOUR HORMON FUNCTIONING THE BEST AND IF THAT ADDIT HELPS YOU GET PREGNANT WHEN YOU WANT TO HELPS YOU HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF SUCCESS WITH IDEA O MY GUSH WHAT A FANTASTIC BENEFIT BUT THET DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T ENJOY SOME OF THESE BAD THINGS HERE AND THERE AS LONG AS YOU'VE SET YOURSELF UP ON THE DAY TO DAY WHERE YOU'RE GIVING YOUR BODY LOTS OF NUTRICIOUS FOOD THAT IT EEDS TO MAK CORMONS SIMILARLY BEING YOU KNO VERY UNDER WEIGHT IN COLORY RESTRICTING WE ALL KNOW IS REALLY TERRIBLE FOR YOUR REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM AND CAN CAUSE THE BRAIN TO TOTALLY SHUT DOWN OVULATION BECAUSE IT SENSES THAT YOU CANT HAVE A PREGNANCY IS EVIL MISCARRY EXCUSES ME FOR AM BY VIRTUE OF BEING UNDER WEIGHT DOES THE BODY THE I I LEARNED AM SOME YEARS AGO THINK THIS IS STILL TRUE THAT ONE OF THE SIGNALS FOR THE ONSET OF PUBRITY ON FEMALES IS THAT LEAPT IN AN A HORMON IS SECRETED FROM BODY FAT AM THAT THEN SIGNALS TO THE BRAIN TO THAT WITHALMISS LIKE OCATE IT'S NOTHERS ENOUGH RESERVES TO CREATE ENVIRONMENT IT'S A SIGNAL BY ENBIRONMENTAL AM THE OTHERS ENOUG ECTRO FACT TT TO HAVE ABAT YOTHERS PRESENTLY ENOUGH FOOD AROUND A TO SUSTAIN THAT MAB NOT RIGHT OR MISCARRIAGES AND LACK OF BODY FAT CORRELATED ON BOTH ENDS OF THE SPECTRUM YES RIHT SO LACK OF BODY FAT AND BEING OVER WEIGHT WE SEE DECREASE AND GETTING PRAGNAT PERMANT AND WE SEE INCREASE AND LOSING PREGNANCIES SO CERTAINLY THERE IS A HEALTHY MEDIUM WHERE YOUR BODY HAS WHAT IT NEEDS AND IT MAKE SENSE BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE I LIKES EVEN SA HYPOTHLEMIC DESFUNCTION SO MAYBE YOUR BRAINS NOT TOTALLY SHUT OFF WHERE IT'S SENDING NOT NO HORMONES IN YOUR NOT ODULATING DOO NOT GETTING PREGNANT IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE BUT CERTAINLY OVULATION DISORDERS ARE ON A SPECTRUM WHERE YOU GO FROM A CERFECTLY SENCRANIZE CYCL TO ONE THAT PROLONGS IT YOU KNOW GET SHORTER TOGETHER THAN PROLONGS THEN YOU HAVE NOTHING THEREIS THE SPECTRUM OF DISFUNCTION WHICH IS REPRESENTING YOUR HORMONIS NOT BEING YOU NECESSARILY PERFECT AND THAT CAN HAVE IMPACTS ON THE PLACENTA TRYING TO GROW INTO THAT UTERUS AND THE PLOCEN IS FASCINATING RIGHT AN ENTIRE TALK JUS ON THE PLACENNA BUT IT HAS DOES THIS INCREDIBLE JOB WHERE YOUR BODY HAS TO NOT REJECT IT YET ALLOW IT TO EAT AWAY AT THE SIGHT OF YOUR UTERES AND GROW INTO YOUR BLOOD VESSELS BUT THAT REQUIRES A VERY SPECIFIC CORMONAL ENVIRONMENT FOR IT TO BE DONE IN TO BE DONE RIGHT I THINK IN THE SAME BREATH OF ALL THIS WOULD DRAW SO ASKING IS YO CASE OF THATS EATING HEALTHY NONE OF THAT SEALLY NEW NEWS FOR MOST PEOPLE ALOUT OF THOSE THINGS I JUST SAID I THINK SO BUT I BE ONE O TANK YOUCAUSE I THINK AN RARELY IF EVER DO WE HEAR SOME BE SO A PHYSICIAN BE REALLY DIRECT ABOUT  HALISAN SOME READ ME YES NOT EXCESSIVE AMOUNC OR ANYS IDEALY FROM A AS SUSTAINABLE SOURCES WHOLE FAT MILK PRODUCTS GRANS FRUITS VEGETABLES ANME THOSE KUND OF AM STRAIGHT WHAT BIT DO YOU SEEM LIKE STRAIGHT FOR DIRECTORS ARE I ACTUALLY PRETTY RARE IN IN THE LANDSCAPE OF OF PUBLIC HEALTH DISCUSSION BECAUSE A MORE OFTEN THAN NOT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT NUTRICION IN THESE KIND OF ELIMINATION DI TITHINGS I YOU KNOW ELIMINATE ALL THE GRAINS OR ELIMINATE ALL THE MEATS OR AM YOU KNOW LIMINATE ALL THE MILK MILK FATS WHEN IN REALITY I THINK PEOPLE FORGET THAT LIKE MOST PEOPLE OUT THEIR OMNIVORCE AN THEY CAN MAKE BETTER COICES ABOUT NOT DELLY MEAT YOU KNOW LESS BACAN IF ANY BACAN RAT ONE EDGIES WITH YOUR LUNT TRAY YOU CAN MAKE BETTER TOICES ON THE DAY TO DAY I THINK THATTHAT IS A GREAT PAINT I THINK THERE'S A PLACE FOR SUPPLEMENTS I THINK THE BIG DISCLAIMER THAT EVERYBODYS CAN SAY WITH SUPPLEMENTS IS THAT THEY ARE NOT REGULATED LIKE THE WAY MEDICATIONS ARE RIGHT AND I WILL SAY SUPPLEMENTS AND HERBS ARE DIFFERENT THINGS RIGHT A SUPPLEMENT BUT MANY COMPANIES ARE ADDING HERBS TO THEIR SUPPLEMENTS AND THAT CAN GET INTO REALLY MERKY TERRATORY ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO HOW SOME OF THESE HERBS DO YOU HAVE ESTERGEN AND PROJUSTON LIKE PROPERTIES AND CAN IMPACT REPRODUCTION AND HORMENTS AND PERHAPS EVEN ENTERGENIC YET YET YETO WE CAN'T ACT LIKE EVERYTHING'S CREATED EQUAL SO I WAS SO EO BOE IF I RECOMMEND YOU TAKE A SUPPLEMENT OR YOUR DOCTOR DOES YOUR DUE DILIGENTE IS TO LOOK AT WHAT IS ALSO INCLUDED AND MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T HAVE THESE EXTRA ADDED THINGS THAT THEIRE UNAWARE OF BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY CAN HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACT AT ONE STAGE OF YOUR LIFE OR ANOTHER DEPINION ON WHERE YOU ARE CERTAINLY YOU KNOW CRENINAL VINEMENT WHICH HAS FOLLIC ACID WE ALL KNOW THAT FOLLIC ASCIATE IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO PREVENT NARL TUBE TO FACTS BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT AND SELDIVISION AND HOW THE OVERY IS GROWING FOLOCALS AND GROWING EGS SO SHOULD PEOPLE WOMEN BUT ALSO MEN BE TAKING A VITEMENT WITH FOLICACID EVEN WHEN THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO HACONCEIVE THERE'S NO HARM IN HAVING IT BUT VERY OFTEN PRAGMENCIES OCCUR WHEN YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO CONCEIVE AND THAT IS A STORE THAT NEEDS TO BE BUILT UP THREE MONTHS A HEAD AT TIME SO WE REALLY NEED YOU TO BE TAKING THAT AHEAD OF GETTING PRAGMET SO NOT JUST LET'S GET PRAGNIT RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO START THIS PRENATO VITEMEN SO I RECOMMEND ANYBODY WHO'S END THEIR REPRODUCTIVE YEARS TAKE A PRENATAL VITEMEN WE ALSO KNOW THAT MANY MANY PEOPLE ARE INVITE HIM INDED TO FEHIENT AND VITHIM INDEE DOES IN PACT REPRODUCTION AND SO I USUALLY SAY A THOUSAND INTERNATIONALINGNES AVIDEM INDE IS NOT GOING TO BE HARMFUL IN ANYBODY IT'S GOING TO BE HELPFUL FOR MOST PEOPLE SOME PEOPLE DEFINITELY NEED HIGHER LEVELS SO WE SCREEN EVERYBODY WITH IVIDE HIM INDEED TO SEE WHO NEEDS TO HAVE EXTRA BUT YOU KNOW A BLANKET STATEMENT THAT EXTRA INVITEM INDEED IS GOING TO BE HELPFUL WHE MEGE THREE FADIACIS ALSO EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN ONE BEING ANTIINFLAMATORY BUT TO PRAIN DEVELOPMENT OF A FEETUS SO MOST PRENADLES NOW ACTUALLY DO HAVE THOSE WHO MEGA THREE FADIACIDS IN THEM BUT IF THEY DON'T I RECOMMEND A PATIENT TAKE THOSE JUST A BREAGOI HAVEIN A QUESTION SUCHIONCERTHON THEIR THE EM THERE'S A LABORATORY UP THE UNIVERSITY CALFORNO SANTABARBER THIT'S POISOM REALLY INTERESTING DIT ASSURING THAT YOU O THE SOCIY BRAIN WEIGHT WHICH IS JUST BUT ONE IN DIRECT MEASURE OF BRAING HEALTH BUT BRAINWEIGHT IN AT BIRTH SEEMS TO BE CORRELATED AT LEAST IN SOME POSITIVE WAY WITH THE AMOUNT OF ESSENTIAL PADIACIDS THAT MOM CONSUME DURING PRAGNANCY DOES THAT SOUND IS A YE LET THUS HOLD AND THERE'S  THERES MY STUDIES ABOUT THE MICER SMARTER WHEN THEY HAVE D IETS YOU KNOW WITH A MGATHRY FADIASIS WHEN THEYARE IN YOU TORE OU WRIHT SO THE EXPOSURE ON THE TIME PERIOD IS VERLY IMPORTANT NO MEGA THREEIS HAVE A LOT OF HELP AND EFFECTS WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR ANY OCCIDENT PROPERTIES ESPECIALLY IN LIKE AN INDEMETRIOSIS DISEASES THAT ARE VERY HIGHLY INFLAMATORY THEY CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL WE'RE DIFLING TO TALK ABOUT YOUR WORK ABOUT AFTER BABY IS ARRIVED AND IMPACT OF E SENTIAL FATIASIS BUT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE DOSIGE CUT OFF ON THIS PART CAST BEFORE AVE TO THROWN OUT NUMBERS LIKE ONE ONE TO TWO GRAHAMS PER DAY OF THE E PA FORM OF ESSENTIAL FATIACID AND WE COULD OVE HOLD THI SCUSSION ABOUT MY GAT THREE O MAE A SIX RATIOS BUT DO YOU YOU THINK THERE'S A UPPER LIMIT IS IS IT TRULY THAT YOU WHAT'S A UP TO FOR GRAHMS PRERDAY OF E P A O IS WOITHHOUT THE ADVENTAGIOUS IS BETTER THAN ONE GRAHAM I SELL PEOPLE AGRAHM A GRANT SO THAT'S ANALONEMENT WITH PRETTY MUCH WHAT WE TALK ABOUT BEFORE SO THAT'S WHAT I RECOMMENDING NON WHEN I GIVE MY HAND OUT TO MY PATIENTS AND HAIRE TRYING TO GET PREGNAT IS CAN HAVE A PRENEADLE A THOUSAND I USE OF VITEM IND GRAHM OF A MEGA THREES AND THIN COCUTON SO COCUTON WHICH YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY IN GENERAL IS TRYING TO HELP THE MITA CONTRYT THUS THE WHOLE IDEA HEARE THAT IT IS HELPING PROVIDE SUPPORT ACROSS THE BODY IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS RIGHT LIKE COCUSENASY IS IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT ARY IS THE BODY BUT EN WEN COMES TO REPRODUCTION WHEN IT COMES TO MYOSIS AN SELL DIVISION AND OPULATION AND AQUALITY AND EVEN SFIRM QUALITY THERE'S A PLACE FOR COCU TEN SHOWING BENEFIT WITHOUT HARM RITE AND SO NOT THEREIS THR ARE HERE NOTHINGS WITHOUT ANY HARM OR ANY RESCA HARM BUT VERY VERY LITTLE SO I USUALLY RECOMMEND IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET PREGNANT AN YOU TAKE COCUTEN A DOSE OF TWO HUNDRED MILGREMS THREE TIMES A DAY SI THIS CONN OF HIGHER DOSE THAN SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE ON AND OFTEN PRENEEDLES NOW HAVE JUST LIKE TWO HUNDRED TOTAL IN IT AN SO USE THE EXPENSIVE INGREDIENTS ARE USUALLY THAT THE A THE LOWER CONCENTRATIONS IAN AN ANYONE JUST ENOUGH SO THEY CAN R ETTIT ON THE LABEL RIGHT WINCLUDES CO COCUTEN A DOES THE FORM OF COCUTEN MATTER CAUSE YOU'LL FIND THEM IN JAIL CAPSILS WHO FOND ALSO FIND THEM IN UNPOWDERED CAPSILS I ALWAYS SAY I MEAN THERE MIGHT BE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL PERSON I MEAN ABSORPTION OF MADICATIN IS REALLY DEPENDAL LOT ON GOT HEALTH AND OTHER FACTORS BUT THE NUMBER ONE ISSUOUS SUPPLEMENTATION IS AT PEOPLE DON'T STICK TO IT SO I ALWAYS SAY WHICHEVER ONE YOU'RE GOING TO CONSISTENTLY TAKE IS GOING TO BE THE BETTER FARMARY A A CUSH ABOUT IL CARNATINE YEM ARESEARCHING AL BUT FOR THIS EPICID ANOTHERS AY YE ORWELL CARNATINE HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN FORD MORTILDI AND SPIR MAY BE AD QUALITY A BUT WE KNOW THAT A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE ORALAL CARNATINE THAT ONE INJEST IS ACTUALLY A UTILIZE O SOME PEOPLE ASHALY PURCHASIN USE INJECTABLE ELL CARNTINE WHICH IS COUNT OF PAINFUL CAUSITS IN IT I'LL CALL THEY SUSPENSION SO NNOT NOT COMFORTABLE SCOU TO BE DONE TRMUSCUARLY BUT MY READ OF THE DATAS KIND OF IMPRESSIVE I WOUNT SAY SUPERIMPRESSIVE ARE YOU EVER INJECTING A PATIENCE OR HAVING THEM INJECT THEMSELVES WITH EL CARNATINE UM THIS WOULD BE BOTH MALE A FEMALE OR MALE A PATIENTE ORE BOTH A OR USING ORL OF CARNTINE OR DU THE DATEGE IS NOT IMPRESS YOU ENOUGH TO TEMOTIVATE THAT WE USE A GRAM OF AL CARNATINE WITH A GRAMMA VITEMEN CEE FOR OUR MALE PATIEN TO HAVE ANY ANIRAL SPIRM PARAMATER AND SO THAT IS KINDOF WHAT WE CONSIDER THE SPERMANHAMPSMAN PROTOCOLL AND SOUST THAT SPRT THAT IT PWENTYVITEMEN GOTOS TO WITH THE MULTIVIDEDMEN AND COUTINS O THAS KIND OF LIKE THE MALE PROTOCALL OF COURSE THERE'S DIFFEREN SPECIFICS FOR ONE INDIVIDUAL PERSON I DON'T TEND TO RECOMMEND IT FOR MOST FEMALES THAT BEING SAID THOSE WHO HAVE INDEMETRIOS AS FALLEN TO A UNIQUE CATEGORY WHERE INFLAMMATION IS SO HIGH THAT USUALLY IT'S A DIFFERENT INVIREMET WHERE WE RECOMMEND AL CARNATINE AND ASIAL SISTINE VITEMENCIAN E STHEY CONFALL EN TO A DIFFERENT CATEGORY CHAS EVEN KNOWN IN FLAMATORY DISEASE BUT IF WE JUST TUNGING OUT THE PERSON AT WHOLE WHO MAY BE ONCS TO TAKE SOME SUPPLEMENTS FOR THEIR R E PRODECTIVE HEALTH THAT HAVE VERY LITTLE SIDE OF FACTS AND FOR THE MOST PART CAN PITENTIALLY BE HELPFUL IS CAN BE NO COCUTAN A CARNATINE VITEM IN SE CAN BE HELPFUL ESPECIALLY FOR THE MALE FOR THE FEMALE PARTNER ORE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THAT EXTRAVITEM NDE IN ADDITION TO THE PRENATO WITH PHOLIC GACID AND WHAT ABUT A WOMEN WITH PICIOAS I GET SOON AN ASACIE I NOCITALSO  AND THERE ARE WE TALKING MYAOCITAL OR THE WHAT IS IT THE DE CAIRO I DON IT HAVE THAT RIGHT YOU DO HAVE THE RIGHT MYONOCITALE IS THE MAIN DRIVER OF A NOCITAL AND HOW IT CAN BE HELPFUL IF YOU MOST BLENDSER CAN HAVE A COMBINATION OF BOTH OF THEM BUT A MUCH HIGHER RATIO OF MYOANOCITAL TO DE CAIRO AND SO MYON OSTILES PROBABLY THE ONE THAT REALLY IS DOING THE WORK AND PIIOAS WHAT IS IT DOING IT IS DEVILLY HELPING THE BODY WHEN IT COMES TO INSOLENT AND SUGAR HELPING THE BODY BE MORE SENSITIVE TOO INSOLEN OR LESS RESISTANT TO IT ESSENTIALLY HELPING YOU RESPOND TO WHAT YOU EAT IN A BETTER WAY AND ALSO LOOKS LIKE IT DOES PETENTIALLY DECREASE SOME OF THAT INFLAMMATION PATHWAY IN PICIOAS IN PIIOAS THIS INSOLEN RESISTANCE CORRELATES WITH THIS TASTACERON PRODUCTION FROM THE OVERY MEANING EVEN THAT FOREMAN ALONE CAN DECREASE TASTACERON LEVELS BASED ON SOME OF THE CHANGE THAT IT HAS IN THE OVERY TAKE NOTEMEN SO MANY IS TAKING THAT FOREMAN OR BURBERING THINKING O THIS IS GREAT ON THE LOWER MY BLOOD SUGAR MIMIC FASTING AND LIVE LONGER AND AND THEN THESE ARE ALSO THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE WRITING ME GO HOW CAN ONE I TAKE THAT FORMER NIGHT EITHER HAVE HEADACHES CAS I YOU KOW ESSENTILLY HIG BI GA I SEE NO BUT ALSO THEIR TESTASTRO LEVELS ARE AR ARE GETTING CRUSHE NOT IN EVERY CASE BUT IT HAPPENS THEN I THINK THOS WH THINKS PEOPLE JUST DON'T THINK ABOUT THEY READ THAT A SUPPLEMENT MIGHT BE BENEFICIAL FOR THIS ONE THING THAT DOESN'T APPLY TO THEM AND THEY START TAKING IT O ALSO THE EVIDENCE OF THAT FORM AN EXTENDING LIFE WE HAD PETER T ON NEAR TICKED BY THE  THE EVIDENCE FOR THAT IS IS LIKE O SO POOR IS JUST NOT REALLY THAT CONVINCING IT MAY CHANGE BUT AND NOW ALL THE EXCITEMENTS ABOUT RAP OF MY SIN AND SO YOU KNOW A EXTENDING YOUR LIFE WHILE PLUMMTING YOUR TESTOSTRON YOU KNOW I MEAN THAT THAT'S A I SEW THAT STRAGI'S BEEN TRIED IN T E LON JEVITY COMME THERE'S A THERE WAS A WHOLE CASTRATION I DON'T O I CAN WRITE THAT OH YETHIS WAS LIKE THE HEAVENS GATE CULT WHERE THEY CASTRATED THEMSELVES  THEY DO DONGER WELL THEY END UP COMMITTING MASS SUICIDES E SO A YOU KNOW THEY END OF THE EXPERMENT EARLY A MANGLY YOU KNOW AM YES SO IN ANY EVENT AM GOING BACK TO O SUPPLEMENTS OR I COALDN'T HELP MYSELF AM SUPPLEMENTS THAT AM WOMEN CAN PERTENTIE TAKE JUST I ININCREASE THEIR FERTILITY EVEN IF THEY DON'T WANT TO GET PRAGNANT AS JUST CONE TO CREATING A MILEU OF HEALTH YOU TALK ABOUT THE NUTRITION YOU TALK ABOUT COKUTEN MAYBE ALL CARNATINE VITHIM AN C A THE ESSENTIAL PADIOSITS GETTING AT LEAST ONE GRAM OF E P A SO THAT MIGHT REQUIRE TAKING TWO GRAHAMS OF OF FISHAL O AIN'T AN YET THAT E THE E P A A MIOWN OSITSALL SO HOW MUCH OR YOU TALKING ABOUT IH'VESEEN SOME PRETTY HIGH DOSAGES THROWN OUT THERE  MI O NOT YAN WHAT'S HE TDOSN'T MOGAMS OKE TAKEN BEFORE SLEEP OR IT DOES IT MATT WHAT DOES IT MATTER THAT  IT THE MATTER THANK YOU FOR COVERING THE TOPIC OF SUPPLEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTATION AM THIS IS PROBY GOOD POINT TO RETURN BACK TO THOSE HARVESTED EGGS AR EGGS ARE OUT AM AND THERE'S A COLLECTION OF THEM FROZEN AM MAYBE JUST MAYBE A LIVE STHEY'REALWAYS ALIVE SORRY A I MEAN RAAPERN AAT I LA THLRASHWERE THE FRESH SPERM THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS LIKE SOME PORTION OF THE EJACULATE IS GOING TO BE AM DEAD SPERMRIGHT SOME LIVE SOME FORMO MOTILE SOME NON AM FOR MOTILE THE TWITCHERS I READ IS  THE NAME   I THE  A AND SO CAY THEY GEN A WASH THE THE SPERM WHY BECAUSE THE HATMOST OF WHAT PEOPLE SEE AS EJACULATE OR KNO EXCUSE ME AS A JACULATE IS AM IS NOT I SHEY THE SPERM I MA GAINT SO BUT SPERMER WASH THERE IN ONE COMPARTMENT AM YET THE EGGS A UT YOU YOU OR YOUR ENBREOLOGIST AT YOUR CLINICK IS THEN GOING TO TAT SOME POINT DECIDE TO COMBINE THEM SO AS IT CAN IS IT A SPERM RACE OR YOU UM MAYBE COULD EXPLAIN IXY YAND WHY WOULD ONE WANT WHY WOULD ONE OP FOR IY AND ARE THERE ANY RISKS WITH XY BECAUSE THEYARE YOU REALLY AT SOME LEVEL THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE I CANT SIT BACK IN O KE SOMEBODY YE SAY NERAL DEVELOPMENT NIGHT SOME LEVEL YOUR SAYING HEH THAT SPERM LOOKS GOOD WEREAS WHEN YOU RUN A SPERM RACE NATURE SAYING HE THE SPERM REALLY DID BEAT ALL THE OTHER SPERM SO LET' SIKE WAY FIRST BECAUSEI THINK THIS AS NICE BECAUSE A QUESTION I GET OS ALL THE TIME WE TUG ABOUT NUTRICIEN AND SUPPLEMENTS AND ALL OF THAT IS TOU NOW YOU'R DOING IVY AT FOR YOU'R FREEZING YOUR EGGS AND WHAT IF WHAT BEHAVIOURS ARE GOOD ARE BAD OF COURSE ALL OF THE SAME ONES ARE BUT ABOUT HOW LONG DONY TO DO THEM AND THIS IS WHY IF YOU LIVE HEALTHY MOST OF THE DAYS IT DOESN'T EONLY MATTER THAT'S HIGE YOUR LIVING BUT WE ALREADY KNOW THE SPIRM CYCLE I ABOUT NINETY DAYS AND THE EGGS I LIKE TO SAY ANOTHER IN THE VAULT THEY BECOME THEY SART LINING UP GETTING READY TO EGX AT THE VAULT AND BECOME MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE THINGS YOU'RE DOING IN THAT NINETY DAY WINDOW AND WE KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE AS WELL SO THEY START TO BE PRIE SELECTED FOR WHOSE COMING OUT THE NEXT MONTH THEY SART TO LINE UP AND SO MAKING THESE CHANGES AS YOU START THINKING ABOUT GETTING PRAGNANT DOING FORTILITY TREATMENTS IS STILL EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL PEOPLE WILL OFTEN SAY WELL I HAVEN'T BEEN DOING OT SO WHY START NOW S NOTKIN TO MAKE IT DEFERENCS BUT TRULY IT CAN OR ALL DRINK UP UNTIL THE WEEK INTO A DAY REEL US OL US I KNOWI O R  I GOT OLD HAVE MY TWO GLASSES OF WINE WHICH ITUALLY EQUATES ABOUT SIX GLASSES OF WINE WHEN YOU MEASURE OUT BY HOW MUCH IS I A RIGHT RIGHT UP UNTIL THE WEEK BEFORE GETTING PRAGNIN OR SOMETHING YAN I KNOW SO SO PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK WHAT SHOULD I BE DOING IS THESE HEALTHY BEHAVIORS AND YOU SHOULD BE DOING EM YOU KNOW THIS HOLD TIME WHEN WE DO IV  AN I MA GETS ALL THE THINGS YOU JUST ASK BUT EARLIER YOU SAID OL HOW TOLERABLE IS IT THE TRUTH IS YOU'RE GIVE TAKING SHOTS THESE ARE SUBUTANEA SHOTS DURING THE EDGROWTH PROCESS SO NEXT TO THE VILLYON NEXT TO THE BELLYBUTTON LIKE HOWA DIABAT IT GIVES ENSILAN A VERY SMALL NEEDL I MEAN NOBODY LOVES SHOTS BUT THEY'RE NOT A BIG AND TREMUSCULAR SHOT IT'S NOT LIKE A FLUE SHOT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THIS I'VE BEEN OST IN THE TEXTIN MOSQUITOES THER WAWAR HER WAYAWA WARIS THAN ONE OF THESE NEEDLES EXACTLY  TO YOU'RE GOING TO USE THOSE MEDICATIONS FOR ABOUT TWELVE TO FOURTEEN DAYS YOU'RE GOING TO HAT YOUR FOLICALS GROW YOURE  GOING TO FEEL THAT YOU HAV PULVIC PRESSURE AS YOURE ESTRGEN RISES YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO THIRD SPACE YOUR FLUID WHICH MEANS YOUR FLUID YOUR WATER COMPONENT OF YOUR BLOOD IS GOING TO START TO DIS EK OUT A LITTLE BIT AND YOU'RE GTTING IT MORE BLOATED YOU CAN HAVE MORE WATER WAY GOING TO FEEL PUFFY AIR AND THAT IS VERY COMMON JUST BECAUSE OF GETTING THE EGGS TO GROW YOU'RE GOING TO MENTALLY BE FINE CAUSE TE FEMALE BRAIN LEVES HIGH ESTERDAN SO YOU'RE DOING FINE AS NOTS ONE OF THE MAIN CONCERNS IS HOW EMOTIONAL WILL I BE AND DURING THIS FASE OF THE PROCESS PEOPLE DEGREAT WHEN WE TAKE THE EGGS OUT OF THE BODY ITS ABOUT A TWENTY MINUTE PRESIGAR IT IS USUALLY DONE UNDER IVY SEDATION LIKE CROPOFALLEN FETINEL AND WE ARE WATCHING WHILE WE DRAIN THOSE FOLICALS AND GET TUSTTUVES FULL OF THE EGGS YOUE SOME PEOPLE OPTIN TOT USE ANY A THEY I SAY I  I HEAR WHARD FENT IN ALL I'M SURE ALO LI AWAY VENTINAL CRAGES AND I YOU OBVIOUSLY FENDALS AT A DRUG THAT HAS ITS USES A TALIDUSIS IN THAT A MEDICAL COMMUNITY AM THES ANY ONE JUST CAN OP FOR YOU KNOW JUST I MOU WE FINANASESIOLOGIST WHO IS REALLY TALKING THE PATIENCE I MEAN PROPEFALLS THE BASE OF IT CERTAINLY THEIRE SOME PATIENCE YOU MAY WHEN IT AVOID NARCOTIC USAGE AND THEY USE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES MEN HERE IS THIS HUGE BREAT THE RETRIEVAL'S POD CAST CAME OUT FOIM LIKE THE NEW YORK TIMES DUING A DEEP DIVE INTO A FERTILITY CONAC YALE WERE A NURSE WITH SCIPHINING OFF FENTINAL FOR HERSELF FOR HERSELF AND REPLACING AT WITH SAILING AND GIVING PATIENT SAILING THESE THIS CLINIC DID NOT DO ANASTHESIA BASE PROPOFAL SO THEY REISUPOSED TO JUST GET FETINAL AND HAVE KIND OF E LESS PAIN ENVIRONMENT NOT A KNOW PAIN AND VIRONEN AND NOT NOT JUST A FEW HUNDREDS OF WOMEN REPORTED EXTREME PAIN EXTREME PAIN THROUGH THE PROCEDURE REALLY SPEAKS LARGELY TO PAIN NOT BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY WHEN THEY WENT AND FOUND THIS OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO AGAIN  WOULD USK WHAT APPENED THIS A TECHNICION WELL I MEAN YE THEYR THER TE TRUN A FONE FIN OLL BEHUND MARSH YET I MEAN AND BUT IT'S YOU JUST HARS TOO LIKE AMYAN I CAN'T IMAGINE I CAN'T IMAGINE DOING I DO THIS PRESCY DER LIKE ALL THE TIME RIGHT HAVE DONE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS IN MY CAREER AND I CAN'T IMAGINE HAVING PEOPLE BE IN PAIN DURING IT SO IT'S BUT IT'S IMPORTAT TO NOW THAT SOME CLINICS DON'T USE I'VE EASE EDATION OR THEY DON'T USE PROPOFALL THY DON'T PUT YOU TO SLEEP UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOUR CLINIC IS USING IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT TO SET THE EXPECTATION OR TO KNOW AN MI GOING TO BE AWAKE OR MY GOING TO BE ASLEEP TOLTHEY SHOULDT ASK YOU TO WHAT SPECIFIC DROGS OR GIN TO GIVE ME TO YOUR UR AND I MEAN SOME CLINICS ONLY DO ONE LIKE I AM NOT GOING TO DO A RETRIEVAL UNDERNO SEDATION NOW SOME CLINICS WOULD ALLOW THAT SOME CLINICS THAT'S ALL THAT THEY DO BUT YOU THAT'S A HUGE PIECE OF PUZZLE THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW IF YOURE PATIEN ARE YOU GOING TO BE FEELING PAIN NOT FELING PAIN WHAT'S AT QOING TO BE LIKE I'LL SEE MOST CLINICS USE PROPOFALL AND PUT PATIENCE TO SLEEP AND SO YOU TAKE A NICE LITTLE NAP FOR FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTES THE EGGS ARE RETRIEVED FROM THE FALLICLS UNDER DIRECT VISUALIZATION THEY'RE INTUS TUBES YOU WAKE UP AND YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL CRAMPY AND YOU'LL GET A PERIOD TENISH DAYS LATER BUT YOU THIS IS WHEN YOU'LL FEEL YOUR WORST NSE JUS JUST THE ONE THING OONE TO SAY ABOUT TOLERABILITY OF IT CAN YOU GET PRIGN INTO MET YE YEATHERE'S A A CASE REPORT OF AN EGDONER WHO IS DON'T EATING HER EGGS AND SHE HAD SECS WITH HER BOY FRIEND AND BECAUSE NOT EVERY EGG IS ALWAYS RETRIVE FRO THE FOLICALS OR SOME SMALL ONES COULD OBULATE TO AND SHE GOT PREGNANT WITH QUINT OPLETS O O CAT SO YOUAVE TO REALLY TELL PEOVLE NOT TO HAVE INHER COURSE ONE FROM AN INFECTIO STANDPOINT CAS WE REALLY ARE POKING YOU KNOW A PRETTY LARGE GAGE NEEDLE THROUGH THE VAGUA YO COSA INTO THE PARITINAL HAVITY SO WE DONT WAN A ENTERODUCE INFECTION BUT ALSO FOR PREGNANCY AN THAT TIME PERIOD AND IF YOU GOT PREGNANT YOUR RISK OF WHAT WE CALL O VERIAN HYPER STIMULATION SUNDRAMAR A H US US IS VERY PROFOUND SO WHAT IS NORMALLY HOPPENING IS AFTER THE RETRIEVAL YOURE ESTEROGEN AND PROGESTERON ARE GON O DROP YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL A SEVERE P AMAS FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD SO YOU'LL BE MORE EMOTIONAL YOU'RE STILL PRETTY BLOATED UNTIL THIS ALL HEELS IF YOU GET AWA CH US US WHICH IS VERY UNCOMMON IN MODERN PRACTICE BUT WHEN YOU DID FRESH AN BRIO TRANSFERS OR PEOPLE WHO DON'T OUTILIZE SOME OF THE MODERN PROTOCALLS THIS MEANS THAT H C G CONTINUES TO INCOURAGE ALL THOSE FOLICALS TO MAKE ESTEROGEN AND PROGUST AROUND AND IF YOU ARE PREGNANT YORE'S CAN HAVE A CONSTANT YET EXPENINTIAL INCREASE AN H C G AND SO THIS IS GOING TO GET WORSE AND WORSE SO WE REALLY DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO GET PREGNANT IN THAT TIME PERIOD U WEL WHEN DURING THAT TIMEPER ATU THE WOD SEX SOAS IT IN THE FEW DAYS BEFO LIE ACTION SO TYPICALLY I USUALLY SAY IT'S FROM LIKE DA FIVE OF YOUR STIMULATION PAY SO USUALLY THE EARLIEST EGRTRIEVALS ARE KUN OF AROUND CYCLE DAY NINE OR TON IF SOMEBODY GOES FAST UNTO YOUR NEXT PERIOD COMES SO IT'S USUALLY BUT A THREE WEEK TIME PERIOD WHERE WE WANT YOU TO ABSTAIN FROM INTERCOURSE SO FOR THE MOST PART THOUGH THE MORE EGGS YOU HAVE THE MORE YOU'REGING TO FEEL BOTH THIS HORMONAL AND PHYSICAL SHIFT THAN THE FEW ERE EGGS THAT YOU HAVE SO WIF YOU HAVE A LOW ACCOUNT AND YOUYOU NEED A DO IVIA FOR FREES YOUR EGGS AND YOU MIGHT DO MULTIPLE CYCLES ARE ROUNDS YOU'REGING TO TOLERATED ACTUALLY PRETTY FINE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOCKING TO HAVE THESE FU SHEFS PHYSICALLY YOU'RE GONG IF FEU'LL FINE AND THAT'S ALWAYS A BIG CONCERN WHEN YOU MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT DIFFERENT STIMULATION TYPES PEOPLE HAVE THIS IDEA THAT THINGS THAT ARE MORE NATURAL ARE BETTER RI JUST LIKE THIS HUMAN THOUGHT THAT NATURAL IS GOOD AN SYNTHETIC IS BAD NATURALLY YOU OBULATE ONE EGAMANT WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO GET EGGS OUT OF YOUR BODY THE SUCCESS IS DETERMINED BY HOW MANY EGGS I CAN GET AND HOW YOUNG YOU ARE SO IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IN MOST CIRCUMSTANCES TO DO A MENAMAL STIMULATION PROTOCALL MEANING PURPOSEFULLY UNDER STIMULATING SOMEBODY BY SAVING THE MONEY IN MEDICATION COST IN ORDER TO PURPOSELY GET FEW ARE EGGS BECAUSE THEIR ODDS OF GETTING THE ULTIMATE SUCCESS OF WHAT THEY WANT IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH LOWER IS THERE I DON'T WANT YOU BE IN THE POSITION I DO WANT O PUT YOU RATHER IN THE POSITION OF AND  LIKE HAVING TO I DEMONIZE YOUR YOUR COLLEGUES IN YOUR PROFESSION BUT I COULD SEE OTHERS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL IN SENSIVE FOR PEOPLE REALLY DESPERATE TO HAVE CHILDREN OR ORH JUST SIMPLY MIGHT ONE HAVE CHILDREN DOWN THE ROAD TO UM THE HERE LOSTIM IS BETTER WERE TALKING MULTIBLE LOSTIN CYCLES THEY MIGHT BE UM EVEN A FRACTION OF THE COST OF THE FULLSTON CYCLE WITHAN THERE MANY MANY MORE OU GOT I MOST IN CYCLES YOU GOT IT YOU MAKE A LOT MORE MONEY BY DOING THINGS THAT ARE NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT AND I MEAN THAT'S NOT UNCOMMON IN MY FIELD WHICH IS VERY SAD BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT BECAUSE REPRODUCTION IN IVIA ARE SO FOREIGN AND UNKNOWN SO MANY PEOPLE WALK IN BLIND NOT KNOWIN IF WHAT THEIRE BEING TOLD REALLY MAKE SENSE FOR THEIR SITUATION THERE ARE COUBLE SITUATIONS WHERE MENTAMAL STIMULATION MAKE SENSE IF YOU ARE ONLY GOING TO MAKE THREE EGGS ORE ONLY TO MAKE THREE EGGS I DON'T NEED ALL THE DRUGS IN THE WORLD TO TELL YOUR BODY TO MAKE THREE EGGS CAUSE HERES ONLY THREE AND SO THAT IS A SENERA WHERE MNTAMAL STIMULATION DOES MAKE SENSE AND THEN THERE'S THE SENARIA WHERE THERE' OMETHING CALLED INVOCELL HAS YOUR RESEARCH EXPOSE YOU TO THIS INVOCELL IS A WAY TO TRY TO TAKE IVYOUF IN TO MAKING IT MORE FINANCIALLY ACCESSIBLE FOR CERTAIN PATIENT POPULATIONS MAINLY PEOPLE WHO DON'T ODULATE LIKE YOUR VERY REFRACTORY PATIOAS PATIENT WHO DOESN'T RESPOND TO MEDICATION OR WO HAVE TUBLE FACTOR AND FERTILITY RIGHT SO YOUR PHELOBIAN TUBES ARE BLOCKED BECAUSE OF CLEMITIA OR AN DEMETRIOSAS AND WE JUST HAVE A PROBLEM HERE THAT EGANSBERM CAN'T GET TOGETHER BCAUSE YOU'RE NOT OBULATING OR YOUR TUBES ARE BLOCKED AN INVOCELL IT'S A DEVICE THAT IS PLASTIC AND YOU CAN FIT HAVE TO TEN AGGS IN IT AND THERE'S A LITTLE MIDDLE CHAMBER WHERE THE SPERM CAN GO AND SO YOU GO THROUGH THIS IVIAF PROCESS WITH THE GOLD TO ONLY GET A TO TEN AGGS COSSAST WHAT FITS IN THE DEVICE AND TEN YOU PUT THE SPERM IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND THEN YOU PUT IT INSIDE YOUR VAGINA AND YOU HOLD IT IN PLACE WITH A DIAPHRAM AND THE VAGINA IS THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE TO INCUBATE AND SO YOU INCUBATE YOUR EMBRYOS IN THIS LITTLE IN VOSELE CONTAINER INSIDE YOUR VAIINA AND THEN FIVE DAYS LATER YOU COME IN AND WE TAKE IT OUT AND WE TAKE THE BASTEMBRYO AND WE TRANSFER IT AND YOU CAN DO A FRESH TRANSFER BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T MAKE SO MANY EGGS SO YOUR CORONS WARN'T SO HIGH YOU PEOPLE LIKE THIS PRESESURE THE SOMETHING A SUM LIKE YLIKSTENIN PROXIMITY TO THE SPRINGING EG LIKE YOU'R TAKE TAKEN AT HOME I CASE ON O LOVE THIS PROCEDURE AND SIR SOME CIRCUMSTANCES AND I SEE IT APPLIED OFTEN IN THE WRONG CASE AND THAT THAT CAN BE FRUSTRADYOUG MIKES IT STILL NOT CHEAP EVEN IF IT'S CHEAPER THEN IVYOUF IT IS STILL NOT INEXPENSIVE AN ANY MEANS AND SO PATIENT SELECTION LIKE MOST THINGS AND THIS FIELD ARE SO IMPORTANT SO LIT O SAY IF YOU'VE HAD NO LAT GIVE SPER IF THE SPERMS THE PROBLEM THEN IT'S PROBABLY NOT SMART TO JUST PRESUME THAT THE SPERM AN EGG WILL BE FINE AND THERE RIGHT LIKE THAT MIGHT BE A CASE WHERE YOU REALLY DO NEED HELP WITH ASSISTED FERTILIZATION OR IF YOU HAVE UNEXPLAINED IN FERTILITY IF WE DON'T KNOW WHY YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET PREGNANT BECAUSE EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD ON PAPER WHAT IF FERTILIZATION IS THE ISSUE AND THESE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE YOU PULL OUT AN ENBOCELL AND THERE'S NO EMBRYOS AND YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE WENT WRONG WAS IT THE FERTILIZATION STUP WAS IT THE GROWTHSTUP OF THE EMBRYOS IN CULTURE SO YOU DO HAVE LESS DATA NOTABLY I LIKE DATA YOU CAN'T DO GENETIC TUSTING AND THIS ISN'T REALLY A STRATEGY THAT ALLOWS YOU TO FREEZE EMBRYOS FOR FUTURE FAMILY GROWTH THAT BEING SAID THE YOUNG PATIENT WHO'S GOT GREAT EG QUALITY WHO MIGHT HAVE REALLY BAD PICIOAS OR TOBLE DISEASE IT CAN CERTAINLY ALLOW THEM THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A CHILD AT A LOWER PRICE POINT WHEN THEY STILL HAVE MANY REPRODUCTIVE YEARS SO FINALIZE THEIR FAMILY YET ALSO IS A LOVELY OPTION FOUR PEOPLE WHO NEED DON'T OSPIRM TO CONCEIVE BECAUSE THE SUCCESSORACES WITH THIS ARE SO MUCH HIGHER THAN AN IU EY WHICH IS WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE USE AN INTRIBUTAN IN SEMINATION AR PUTTING THIS FIRM IN THE UTERES SO NOW WERE ABLE TO IMPROVE THIS OUTCOME SO LIKE OUR SAME SEX COUPLES OR AR SINGLE PARENTS BY CHOICE IF IT'S A SINGLE WOMAN WHOSE TRYING TO BECOME APPARENT THEN THEY NEED A BY DONE OR SPIRM AND GO THOG THE PROCESS ANYWAY THIS OFTEN CAN IMPROVE THAT EFFICACY THROUGH THE PROCESS PENDING THEIR AGE AND OTHER FACTORS THERE WAS A STUDY THATE IT IS FULLY NEED THERE'S A LESBEIN COUPLE AND ONE OF THEM THE EGGS CAME OUT OF AND THE OTHER ONE INCUBATED THE EMBRYOS AND THEND THE OTHER ONE HAD THE EMBRAA TRANSFER O BUT IT GAVE BOTH PARTNERS A WAY TO FEEL A LITTLE MORE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS WHICH I JUST HNK IS ALWAYS A REALLY COOL WAY WHEN YOU HAVE THESE DIFFERENT OPTIONS WITH REPRODUCTION SEEMS ALSO EM THAT IT'S A MORE OF A THREE TO MENIONAL ENVIRONMENT I ALWAYS IMAGINE THAT THE PUTRIDISH IS N' A APPROACH AM ISE THAT SO TWO TO MENTIONAL COMPARED TO THE BODY AND ALLTESE THINGS HAVING DONE SELF CULTURE BEFORE AND IN A CULTURED NUR ON ON THNGS THAT SURE LICE E THESE ALTHESE CONCERNS WET LIKE THE CONCENTRATION OF S EO TONONANTHING OR YOU DON YOU KNOW GOT FORBID IF THERE'S A A FLUCTUATION IN YOU YOU AVE BACK UP GENERATORS AND THINGS BUCH IN THE ELECTRICAL FLOAT OF THE INCUMATORS THAT'S DISTROPTED RES THE NATURAL VIRONMENT OF THE BODY EVEN THE FLUCTUATES IN TEMPERATURE IT'S ON THIS IS EVOLVED OVER YOU TENS OF THOUSANDS IF NOT E HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS TO BE THE PROCESS BY WHICH EMBREALS ARE CREATED SO THERE SEEM SO HERE'S WERE I SORT OF DEFAULT IN MY MIND ANYWAY O TO THE GAND LIKE ALL LIKE IT SEEMS MORE NATURAL TYOU'RE INCUMATING IN THE MORE CORTINGUAT MORE NATURALLY AND BUT OF THE SAME BREATH WHAT WHY ARE YOU HAVING IN FERTILITY IF YOU'RE AN INFERTILITY PATIENT RIGHT SO IF YOU NEED DON'T OR SPERM YOU MAYBE DON'T HAVE IN FERTILITY OR IF YOU HAVE TUBLE DISEASE YOU'VE A VERY DEFINED REASON WHY WE DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S THIS HUGE IN FLAMATORY ISSUE IN YOUR BODY OR SOMETHING UNKNOWN SO AGAIN I'LL SEE IT APPLY TO PEOPLE WHO REALLY ARE BAD CANDIDATES FOR IT BASED ON THEIR AGE OR BASED ON THEIR DIAGNOSIS AND SO IT'S NOT ALWAYS BETTER BUT FOR THE RIGHT PATION  MEAR I'VE HAVE PATIENTS HAVE BABIES THAT WAY WHO OTHERWISE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IS JUST TAKEN IU CAN REALLY OPEN UP THE DOOR SO THAT'S THE MOST MANIMAL OF THE MENIMAL STIMULATION RIGHT THEN WE HAVE MENIMAL STIMULATION BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE MANY EGGS SO WE DON'TREALLY NEED THAT BUT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY PEOPLE WHO GO THROUGH EG FREEZING OUR IDEAF WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO GET AS MANY EGGS AS YOU POTENTIALLY HAVE EVERYBODY HAS A DIFFERENT NUMBER BUT WHATEVER YOU HAVE WHATEVER THAT ANTROPHOLICAL KIND IS FOR YOU IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AND THAT'S WHAT THESE COMBINATION OF MEDICATIONS IS TRYING TO DO WHEN THE EGGS COME INTO THE LAB IF YOU HAVE EGG FREEZING VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW AS BEFORE WE GET INTO THE EXY DISCUSSION THE EGGS ARE STRIPPED OF THEIR OUTER CELLS WHATH IS CALLED HE CUMULUS THAT'S WHAT THE SPERM HAS TO ATTACHED TO IN ORDER TO FERTILIZE IN ORDER TO FREEZE THE EGGS THIS CUMULA SELLS ARE STRIPPED OFF THE EGGS ARE FROZEN YOU HAVE TO DO EXY SO IF WE'RE GIN A LEADIN TO THIS IXY CONVERSATION IF YOU'RE FREEZING YOUR EGGS YOU'RE HAVING NEXY WHEN YOU FERTIL SEM SO I DON'T WANT SOMEBODY TOEVER NOT KNOW THAT IF THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE CHOOSING NIXY IS YOU CAN TELL US YES IU SEE SANDS FPOR ITS I SEE ASIE OR INTERASIDE O PLASMAC SPIRM INJECTION IT IS TAKING A SPIRM THAT UNDER THE MICROSCOPE LOOKS NEWARMAL IN SHAPE AND MOVES WELL AND YOURE PULLING IT UP INTO A LITTLE NEEDLE AND YOUR SENTIALLY USING A LITTLE LAZIR ON THE SIDE OF THE AGG ORE THE ZONE A POLLUCID OF THE AGG AND YOURE INJECTING TAT ONE SPIRM IN TO THAT EXSIDE PLASM AND YOU'RE PICKING THAT SPIRM ON THE BASIS OF SHAPE MOTILITY YOU'RE PIKING WHAT YOU THINK IS IS THE BEST SPIRM IN THE BATCH OBVIOUSLY YOA YOU'RE PICKING I MEAN THERE'S EON ME ONE SPIRM PERAG SO THERE'S MULTIPLE SPIRM THAT ARE CHOSEN BUT YOU'RE PICKING SPIRM THAT LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST POTENTIAL MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE'S A RANGE FROM VERY LOW TO POTENTIALLY HIGH BUT HOPFULLY NOT HIGH OF DIN A FRAGMENTATION AND PRETTY MUCH EVERY SELL THE BITE LIKE THE CELLS ALL RO REPAIRING ITS DEONE SO WHEN VISUALLY SELECTING A SPIRM A FR E FOR IXY IT'S IT'S PASEAL MORPHOLOGY SHAPE IN MOTILITY RIGHT YOU CAN'T SEE THE DEINA DAMAGE INSIDE THE HEAD OF THE SPIRM ON THE DEONAAT SELF I WE SOON HAVE A TECHNOLOGY WHERE YOU CUN ACTUALLY A LIKE GET A DYE THAT COULD LABEL DIN A FRAGMENTATION AND NSELECT EM BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE SO MWHEN WE TALK WHAT EN BREOLOGY NOT TO GET TOO FAR DOWN IN THE WEEDS BUT A LIKE THE THE METHODS OF SELECTING EGGS AND SELECTING SPIRM I MEAN THESE ARE THE SAME METHODS THAT BEEN USING IN REOLOGY FOR LIKE SINCE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES LIKE ALL THIS ONE LOOKS GOOD THAT ONE LOOKS GOOD AND THE SKILLEDEN BREOLOGIST CAN CAN REALLY DEVELOP A A REAL TALENT AT OVERTIMAP LIKE KNOWING WHAT CORLADE WITH HEALTHY PRAGMENCY AND AN AN OFFSPRING BUT I DO LIKE TECHNOLOGY YOUOULD THINK THAT BY NOW TWENTY TWENTY THREE THAT SOME ONE WOULD HAVE SOME DIE THAT YOU COULD DROP ON THE SPIRMINGGOL WILL LIKE THAT ONE HAS LOT OF OF DIN A FRAGMENTATION IN THAT ONE ORAY THERE SHOULD BE BETTER WAYS TO CHOOSE WHICH SPIRM THERE'S AFIMLY PEOPLE ARE TRYING THINGS NOTHING AS PROVEN TO BE HELPFUL SO FAR THERE'S EPHLY SOME INT RIST AND THIS BECAUSE WE'RE TARTING TO GET MORE INSIGHT AS WE HAVE BECOME BETTER AT EMBRAO CULTURE GETTING EMBRAASE TO GROW DOING CENTIC TUSTING ON IMBRYOS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT MEL GENOME KICKS IN AT DAY THREE AND THERE'S A SUBSET OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEAUTIFUL FERTILIZATION AND EMBRYO GROWTH DEZERO TO THREE AND THAT'S ALL ON THE EGG AND THEN AS SOON AS THAT MALE GENOME KICKS AN YOU HAVE THIS HUGE DROP OFF IN YOUR IMBRYO NUMBER AND EVEN SOME OF THIS IS IN THE CONTEXT OF NORMAL SPIRM PARAMETERS WRITE SO THINGS AREN'TREALLY NORMAL THOUGH ER THERE'S SOMETHING UNDERLYING IT DEAND THAT EVERY EMBRYO FAILIURON DAY THREE POST FEALIZATION NOL ON BST NOT BUT IT DEFINITELY MEANS THAT NONE OF THE ONES BEFORE THAT CAN BE BLAMED ON THE SPIRM AND ONCE AFTER THAT THERE'S EFINALY STILL MATERNAL AND SPIRM CONTRIBUTION AND WE ON'T ACREAT ANY O ET A COUPLE A DISPUTES AROUN THIS OM BUT IT CAN BE AN  AN INSIGHT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO LOOK THROUGH SOMEBODY'S I BE OFF CYCLE ABOUT POTENTIALLY MODIFIABLE FACTORS RIGT CAN YOU IMPROVE SPIRM QUALITY BY SOME OF THESE LIFESTALL MEASURES I MEAN THE DEBATABLE THING ABOUT A DEONA SPIRM FRAGMENTATION SO WHAT IS THAT IT IS NOT AB NORMAL SEAMAN ANALYSIS BUT IT IS LIKE THAT AS FAR AS AS THEY SPIRM SAMPLE THAT 'S THEN SENT OFF TO BE EVALUATED HOW MUCH FRAGMENTATION OR ABNORMAL DEONA IS IN THE HEADS OF THOSE SPIRM THE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE ABNORMAL DENA SPIRM PROGMENTATION SHOULD DO IXY BOR THAT'S LIKE THE POINT OF THE STUDY NOW IX SEES BECOME VERY COMMONPLACE SO EXY CHOOSING THE SPIRM TO PUT INTO THE EGG ORIGINALLY DIDN'T EXIST TRITES O WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE CONVENTIONAL FERTILIZATION THIS IS HAVING YOUR PETRY DISH YOUR EGGS ARE ON IT YOU SCORT YOUR SPIRM YET COVER IT UP YET PUT T IN THE INGUBATE ORSHEDIN MAN YOU SQUIRT YOUR SQRANSHE MENSE MENT THE TEC THE EMBRYOEMBRYALITIS  SQUAICES THE SPIRM ON MATLEER JUST THRE CEAND THEN PULLS IT OUT AND THE NEXT TAY SEES BY WHICH EGGS ANDS FIRM FERTILIZED WELL IT'S REALLY DEVASTATING TO PULL OUT THE DISH AND HAVE NO FERTILIZATION AND IT DEFINITELY IS A CAUSE OF INFERTILITY AND IT CAN BE VERY HARD TO KNOW THAT BECAUSE FERTILIZATION IS NOT CHALLENGED ON A CELLIA LEVEL UNTIL YOU CHALLENGE IT SO IXEE USED TO BE AN OUT ON COST IT USED TO BE A SEPARATE THING BECAUSE IT WAS HARDER TO FIND IMBREOLOGIST WYO COULD DO IT IT'S SO STANDARD THAT A LOT OF CLINICS DO IT THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME PURELY BECAUSE YOU OFTEN DON'T KNOW ALL THE VARIABLES THAT ARE IMPACTING FERTILIZATION AND YOU'RE TRYING TO GIVE SOMEBODY AS MANY OPPORTUNITIES AS POSSIBLE IXEE HASE IN A LOT OF THOSE ORIGINAL IVEAO STUDIES GOT SOME OF THE BAD REPUTATION OF BEING THE PROBLEM WITH WHY YOU MIGHT SEE THAT ONE PER CENT RISE A BIRTH EFFECTS AND SO IXE TOOK THE BRUNT FROM A LOT OF THAT WE REALLY DON'T SEE THAT WHEN WE'RE GROWING OUT AND WE'RE DOING FREEZING THE EMBRYOS DOING FROZEN TRANSFERS AND WAS I MEAN WHY DO YOU EXCEEN ALMOST EVERY PATIENT AMONG A SAING EVERY ONE BE HIRE PROBABLITY OF SUCCESS HIROBITY SUCCESS TAND WHEN YOU GET TO THIS POINT AND SO FEW PEOPLE HAVE IN TURNS COVERAGE SO THEY'RE SPENDING THER MONEY THEYRE GETING SECOND MORTGAGES ARE TAKING OUT LONES IF THERE'S ONE DECISION THAT YOU SAY WHILL I DON'T KNOW YOU COULD HAVE ZERO EGGS FERTILIZE OR I COULD HAVE THE EMBRYOLOGIST PICK THE BEST FIRM AND PUT THEM INSIDE THE EGG AND WE EXPECT TO SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT CHANCE OF FERTILIZATION THAT MAKE SENSE FOR THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THAT THAT THE MIX SENSE TO ME I OM BECAUSE I'M OBSESSED WITH DATA AND OU THE BLOOD WORK FAIRLY REGULARLY NOND NOT OBSESSIVELY BUT  THE TWICE A YEAR OR SO AND NOW I DIDN'T ALWAYS YOU THAT I ACTUALLY DID WHEN THESE M THE INAFRAGMENTATION TAST AT THEIR PRETTY EXPENSIVE THE OTHER IN THE AARM MORE THAN A SEAMAN ELSE OTHERTHERN THE NO LO THE OTHER SHOW TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS OR SO AT LEAST THE ONE THAT I DID IT WAS VREAYINFORMATIVE LIKE OS RELIEVE TO SEE NOT ABNORMAL LEVELS OF DEIN A FRAGMENTATION BUT I WILL SAY THAT BHASTE ON EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID IT SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT BE THE LOWER COST OPTION BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE ALTERNATIS TO GO THROUGH REPEATED CYCLES OF HIV THE EFFIN ITS FAILING AND THAT'S CERTAINLY MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE IFIS AND I MEAN I WILL SAY THAT THERE IS SOME CURRENT THOUGHT BY MY EUROLOGY COLLEAGUES RIGHT SO I NOT A EUROLOGIST BUT DEFINITELY WHEN I HAVE A MALE WHO YOUO NEEDS A SFIRM EXTRACTION AND MAY BES HAD A PRIOR POSACTIME MAYBE HIS GOT VERY LOSPIRM COUNTS AND WE'RE GOING IN WERE DOING A SPIRM EXTRACTION PROCEEDURE THAT POTENTIALLY IF YOU HAVE A PATIENT YOU HAS AN ABNORMAL DEIN A SPIRM FRAGMENTATION AND EVEN WITH IXY HAS THIS DROP OFF AN EMBRYO GROWTH AFTER DAY THREE BECAUSE THE SPIRM ARE STILL BE MADE THE SAME WAY OEADER THEY STILL FRAGMENTED THAT POTENTIALLY THE EJACULATORY PROCESS COULD COSE SOME OF THAT FRAGMENTATION AND CERTAIN MEN AND THE BY GOING IN INDOING A SPIRM EXTRACTION AND NOT SUBJECTING THOSE SPIRM TO THE RIGORS OF EJACULATION FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD COULD POTENTIALLY LESSEN THER FAGMENTATION AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND I HAVE SOME PATIENCE TO WE'VE GONE DOWN THAT ROAD AND THAT HAS HELPED THEM CLEAR TO SAY THERE'S NON A STUDY THAT'S NOT THE POINT OF DEANA SPIRM FRAG ITS TO TRY TO DISTINGUISH IF POTENTIALLY EXY COULD BE A HELPFUL TECHNOLOGY BUT A LOT OF DOCTORS ARE OFFERING OR DOING EXE BECAUSE WE WANT YOU TO FERTILIZE YOUR AGS WHEN THEY GROW IT IN CULTURE AS WE TOOK WAT I BE EFCHANGING THE METABOLC NEEDS OF THE EMBRYO YOU KNOW CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS AND SO AND BRIAL CULTURE HAS BECOME SO MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL BUT EVEN IN THOSE BEST CASE THAN AREOS WERE LOOKING AT FIFTY PER CENT PROGRESSIONS SO YOU'R GONE A HAVE LOSS THROUGHOUT THAT CULTURE PROCESS NO MATTER WHAT AND YOU SAID FIFTY PER CENT PROGRESSIONS SO HALF OF THE FERTILIZED EMBRYOS THAT MAKE IT PASS ATELY THE SADAY SEVEN THAN THERE SCREEN FOR COMS ON MOL ABNONALITIES THAT OCAEN YOU'VE GOT ONLESSY TWO OR THREE OF THOSE MAY BEFORE DOPANY HOW MANY EGEAN  IVRSED AND YOUR AGE AND THEN AN ANAGE YEST THINK Y OU AND THEN AND THEN YOU SAID OF THOSE THAT ARE IMPLANTED IN TO LET'S A AWOMAN I YOU FORTY FIVE OR YOUNGER YOU'RE LOOKING IT ABOUT ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY TO SIXTY FIVE PER CENT I'M SUCCESSFUL IN PLANTATION AN PRAGNAS YOU LIKE BA HEALTHY BABY IT'S USUALLY V SIXTY FIVE PER CENT CHANTS OF LIFE BIRTH IF IT'S A GENETICALLY TESTAT MBRYO THAT THAT THAT ASTRICT IS THE F AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE GIN TO SEE SUCH VERYING I V F SUCCESS RATES BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T DU GENETIC TESTING OF EMRYOS LET'S USE THE FORTY YEAR OLD WHO MAKES FOUR EMBRYOS AND I SEND THEM OFF FOR GENETIC TESTING I ANTICIPATE SHE IS ONE NORMAL EMBRYO IF I DO GENETIC TESTING WHICH TAKES IT'S CALLED PG T PREAMPLATATION GENETIC TESTING I AM TESTING FOR ANNU PLOITY IS THE TRADITIONAL TESTINE ME DOES IT HAVE THE RIGHT NUMBER CROM IS OMES YOU CAN ALSO IMPORTANTLY TESS FOR SINGLE GENE DISORDERS LIKE CYSTIC FIBROCES OR HONEINGTONS BUT IF WE'RE JOS DOING PAG T FOR ANNIPLOITY I EXPECT AN AG RELATED PROPORTION OF YOUR AGGS TO BE NORMAL OR ABNORMAL SO AT AGE FORTY I EXPECT TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT NORMAL SO I CAN CHOOSE THAT ONE AND PUT IT IN YOU AND HAVE A SIXTY FIVE PER CENT CHANCE THAT YOU HAVE A BABY I COULD NOT DO IT I SELL THE SAME FOUR THAT ONE IS IN THERE BUT IF I GO IN TRANSFER THEM EACH INDEPENDENTLY I'M NOW GOING T HAVE CLOSER TO A TWENTY TO THIRTY PER CENT CHANCE OF SUCCESS RIT SO IT IS NOT THAT I'M CHANGING THE EMBRYO BY TESTINGAT BUT I'M ALLOWING MYSELF TO HAVE HIGHER UTILITY OF SUCCESS HIGHER EFFICIENT CEIV PUTTING SOMEBODY THROUGH LESS FAILE TRANSFERS WHICH IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND LESS MISSCARRIAGES BECAUSE THOSE ALSO TAKE TIME AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IS THT YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND HOW MANY POTENTIAL NORMAL EMBRYOS YOU HAVE AN BATCH CYCLES SO YOU COULD GO INTO ANOTHER CYCLE BECAUSE I'M FORTY I JUST NOT MY PERSON I REALLY ONE TO HAVE TWO KIDS BECAUSE MY CIBLINE IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN MY LIFE YET NATURALLY BY THE AGE I WOULD BE FOR THAT SECOND CHILD IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO CONCEIVE I CAN GO THROUGH I VEAF AN B OCH SOME MBRYO SO I COULD SAVE TWO OR THREE FOR THAT SECOND BABY THAT I'M NOT GOING TO TRANCEFER FOR A FEW YEARS AND IT'S CALLED EMRYO BANKING AND THAT IS CHANGING THE WAYS THAT PEOPLE CAN POTENTIALLY GROW THEIR FAMILY OT LATER AGES BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THOT UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT'S NORMAL ARE NOT AND IT ALSO GIVES YOU THE CHANCE TO GOAD AN INTERVENE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY OF YEAR OLDER I'M AVE A HIGHER CHANCE OF SIX SENS THAN IF I AM FOUR TRANSFERS DOWN THE ROAD AND MAYBE THERE WAS ONE MISS CARRIAGE AND THERE TWO WE'RE SUDDENLY NOW EIGHT MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD BEFORE I CAN GO DO ANOTHER CYCLE AND GET MORE EGS VERSE S IF I FOUND OUT THAT NONE OF THOSE WERE GENETICALLY NORMAL THE AVERAGE FORTY YEAR OLD MIGHT HAVE THE ROAD TO ONE IF THEY HAVE AVERAGE OVERYAN RESERVE PER CYCLE SO THEY'RE GOING TO NEED MULTIPLE CYCLES IS NOT THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE BUT ITS JUST STUDDYING THAT ROAD OF EXPECTATION FOR THEM BUT IF I DON'T GET ANY NORMAL EMBRYOS I CAN TURN RIGHT AROUND AND GO GET MORE SO I AM USING WHAT'S LEFT IN THAT A VARYIN VAULT EACH MONTH TO TRY TO GET TO THAT OPPORTUNITY OF A PREGNANCY FOR YOU AND A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT WAY BY UTILIZING GENETIC TESTING OF THESE EMBRYAS THIS IS WHERE WE CAN PUT IN ELIPS IN IN SIRLIKE DHOT DOT DOT HEALTHY BABY AND AM MAYBE IN THE FUTURE A IF WE'RE LUCKY YOU'LL COME BACK AND TALK TO US ABOUT UM HEALTHY PREGNANCY ALAMO AND AH HEALTHY BABY ONWARD AM THOT'LL BE A FUN AN IMPORTANT SET OF DISCUSSIONS I WOULD LIKE TO TOUCH ON THE CALL THE ISSUE BUT THE TOPIC OF MENOPAUS WHICH I SOOM IS TO FIND AS THE CESSATION OF MENCES AM BUT THE'RE I'M GUESSING AND I'M GESSING IT'S THE CONSTELLATION OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN U AND I HAVE A VERY STRAET FOR A QUESTION WHICH IS IS THERE AN ACCELERATION OF THE ONSET OF METAPAUS ARE WE SEEING THAT NOWADAYS UM ARE THE GOOD DATA ON THAT UM SHOULD PEOPLE TRY TO DELAY MENOPAUS WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS SAT UM YOU TALK TO PATIENCE ABOUT REMS OF THEIR CONSIDERATIONS OF WAYS  YESE THAT TRANSITIONOR MAY BEVEN OFF AT THAT TRANSITION WITH A ORMOR REPLACEMENT THERE  BE R OTHER OTHE REPROACHES THESE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS AND I DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A HUGE INTEREST IN UPCOMING YEARS AS WE HAVE LEARNED MORE ABOUT THE MAN APOZTLE TRANSITION AND THE HEALTH RISKS REALLY ASSOCIATED WITH BEING HYPO ESTROGENIC OR HAVING LOW ESTRAGEN MEN APAUSE IF WE DEFINE IT AS OVARIAN FAILURE SO YOUR OVERIES NOW HAVE NO EGGS OR SO FEW EGS THAT THEY ARE REFRACTORY TO THE BRAIN SENDING OUT EFES AGE SO YOUR BRAIN IS SENDING OUT ALL THE EFFESS AGENOWLEDGE THAT IT CANE YOUR OVERY IS DONE AND NOT MAKING ANY ESTRODYLE OR PRODUST OR OWN ANY MORE IN THIS TYINE PERIOD WHAT WE KNOW IS ONE ARE WE SEEING A POPULATION BES INCREASE IN EARLIER MENAPAS THERE'S NOT BEEN A STUDY TO SAY THAT OBSERVATIONALLY INCLENECALLY I WOULD SAY YES BECAUSE I SEE SO MANY YOUNGER WOMEN HAVING LOW OVERING RESERVE OR HAVING PREMATURE OVARIAN FAILURE OR PREMATURE OVARIN INSUFFICIENCY WHICH IS THE MORE POLITICALLY CORRECT WAY OF SAYING IT BUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS IS IS THERE ARE MODIFIABLE FACTORS RIGHT IF RUNNING OUT OF EGGS IS A VARIABLE AND WE ARE ADY SAID CERTAIN THINGS LIKE SMOKING CIGARETTES AND EXPOSURE TO TOCSENS AND LIKELY CHRONIC INFLAMMATION AND UNTREATED DISEASE WE KNOW THAT HAVING DIABETIES THOSE THINGS INCREASE YOUR RISK OF GOING INTO MENAPAS EARLIER SO PAYING ATTENTION TO THE LIFE STYLE THAT YOU HAVE WHEN YOU'RE NOT CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR FERTILITY RIGHT WHEN YOU'RE IN YOUR YOUNGER YEARS AND MAYBE YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT GETTING PREGNAT YET YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT MENIPAS BUT THOSE CHOICEIS THAT YOUR MAKING IN THOSE TIME PERIODS AT LEAST FOR WOMEN YOUR EGGS ARE GUNHOLD ON TO THEM SO THEY HAVE AN INFLUENCE LATER SIMILARLY TRYING TO LIVE A LOWER IND FLAMATORY LIFE AND GETTING SLEEP AND AVOIDING TOCINS OF WHICH YOU CA ONE ITS SOME OF THE BEST THAT YOU CAN DO TO TRY TO NATURALLY PROLONG WHEN YOU'LL GO THROUGH MINOPAUS WITH THE HUGE CAVIATE THAT EVERYBODY IS TRULY BORN WITH A DIFFERENT NUMBER AND YOU DO NOT CONTROL THAT YOU DON'T AND SO YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN BORN WITH A LOWER NUMBER AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE THAT TRAJECTORY AND YOU MIGHT HAVE CAN'CER AND BE EXPOSED TO KEEM WITH ARAPE WHICH ALSO WILL DEEPLY YOUR OVARIAN RESERVE BUT SO DO THINGS LIKE INDEMITRIOSIS ESPECIALLY IF IT'S NOT BEING TREATED IN ANY FASHION SO THAT'S WHERE WE THINK THE BIRTH CONTROL PILL OR PROJUSTIN EXPOSURE OR SURGERY WAYS TO GO IN DECREASE THE INFLAMMATION IT'S THAT INFLAMMATION AS SHO SAYED WITH IN DEMITRIOSAS THAT'S REALLY CAUSING THESE WOMEN TO HAVE LOW OVARIAN RESERVE AND GO INTO MENOPAUS EARLY SO NOT ONLY IS THAT IN PACTING YOU KNOW FERTILITY AND HOW MANY EGGS YOU GET IN HOW LONG YOU HAVE TO GROW YOUR FAMILY BUT WHEN YOU GOING TO MINOPAUS EARLIARE YOU HAVE LOWER LIFE EXPECTANCY THAN PEOPLE WHO GO IN TO MENOPAUS LATER AND THAT'S WHY YOUVEN SED OF EARLIER FERTILITIES THIS VARIABLE KIND OF REFLECTING LONG GAVITY AND LIKE HEALTH OVER ALL SO WHAT WE DO KNOW ABOUT MINOPAUS IS THAT HAVING THAT LOW ESTERGEN WHETHER THAT HAPPENS AT THE AVERAGE AGE OF MANOPAUS AT FIFTY ONE FIFTY TWO OR AT AN EARLIER TIME PERIOD IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE BRAIN YOU KNOHIERISTS OF DIMINTIA INCREASE RISKS OF ASIAPAROSES INCREASE RISK OF HEART DISEASE AND STROKE AN ESSENTIALLY HIGHER RISTS OF DEATH AND THAT'S NOT EVEN TO TALK ABOUT THE IMFACT ON YOUR LIFE WHAT IT CAN BE LIKE TO HAVE HOT FLASHES HEAT AND COLD IN SENSITIVITY TO HAVE PROFOUND VOLVAR AND VAGENAL ATROPHY TO THE POIN THAT YOU NO LONGER WANT TO HAVE INNERCOURSE AND THE CHANGES THAT IT CAN EVEN HAVE ON YOUR GUT AND EURNIAN SYSTEM SO WE AS A COMMUNITY YOU KNOW OF DOCTORS ESPECIALLY OBEJUIEND REALLY RECOMMEND PORMON REPLACEMENT THEREPE IN WOMEN WHO ARE GOING THROUGH MINOPAS AND THE KEY HERE IS TO INITIATE IT RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING THAT BIG WOMEN'S HEALTH INITIATIVE STUDY WHICH CAME OUT FOR EVER AGO AND SHOWED ALL THIS HARM WITH HORMONE REPLACEMENT THEARIPE THE BIG ISSUE THERE WAS THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE HYPO ESTERGENEC FOR TENPLUS YEARS AND ONE GROUP AND THEN STARTED BACK ON THE HORMONES AND IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE THEY ALREADY BEEN PUT INTO THIS HYRERIS CATEQUORY AND THEIR BODY HAD AJUSTED TO NOT HAVING THE HORMONES AND WHEN RE EXPOSE THEY HAD MORE ADVERSE EVENTS BUT IF YOU ARE STARTING ON ESTERGEN REPLACEMENT AND IT IT CAN BE VARIOUS BUT HONESTLY THE ESTROGON THAT WE TRY TO REPLACE AND THIS TIME PERIOD MUCH MORE MIMICS ESTRADYAL WE'VE ESTERADYLE PILLS IF YOU CAN HAVE VAGEAL INSERTS YOUN A PATCHES SO IT DEPENDS ON WHAT'S GON TO WORK FOR YOUR LIFE BUT IT IS NOT THE BIRTH CONTROL PILL MOST OFTENLY IN SOME PEOPLE IT MIGHT BE THAT'S WHAT THEY CHOOSE BUT WE REALLY ARE TRYING TO PICK AND ESTERGON THAT IS ESTRA DYAL WHERE MEMICS THAT NATURAL STRUCTURE AND YOU CAN'T HAVE UNOPPOSED ESTRGEN WITHOUT REACHING THE RISK OF IN DEMETRIAL CANCERE AND SO THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO HAVE SOME PROJUSTON SO SOME PEOPLE WILL CHOOSE A DAILY PROJUSTON SOME WILL CHOOSE A CYCLIC PROJUSTON AND STILL HAVE PERIODS SOME WILL PUT IN AN IUDEE AT THIS TIME PERIOD AND THEN TAKE THEIR DAILY ES ESTERGON THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE LOWEST DOSE OF HORMONES THAT RELIEVES YOUR SYMPTOMS TO PROVIDE YOU RELIEF FROM SOME O THESE LIFE STELL ISSUES BUT ALSO HEALPS YOU NOT JUST LIVE LONGER RIGHT WE'RE NOT JUST TRYING TO LIVE LONGER WE WANT TO BE HEALTHY LONGER WE WANT TO HAVE A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE AND CERTAINLY WOMEN'S HEALTH HAS FOR LONG STOPPED AT THIS MENAPOZLE PERIOD AND THEN IT'S BEEN YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN KID AND THIS IS WHEN WERE REALLY TURIN TO SEE THAT INTERVENING AT THAT PLACE ESPECIALLY BOR WOMEN WHO GOING TO OVERINTELL YA EARLY SO THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOW OBERING RESERVE WHO I DIAGNOSE I TELL ALL OF THEM HEY IF YOU DON'T FREESE YOUR EGGS ARE I NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN YOU'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH METAPAS EARLY AND WHEN YOU DO I WANT YOU TO GO SEE SOMEBODY I DON'T WANT YOU TO JUST IGNORE IT AND SUFFER WITH THESE SYMPTOMS WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT DOES COMMONLY HAPPEN SO JUST MAKING SURE THAT WOMEN ARE EMPOWERED TO KNOW THAT THESE SYMPTOMS ARE WHAT HAPPENS IT'S WHAT HAPPENS NATURALLY BUT BY GIVING THEIR BODIES MORE ASTRGON AND NOT CRAZY HYGOSA IS BUT JUST THESE PHYSIOLOGIC LEVELS CAN REALLY IMPROVE OF THE QUALITY IN THE LONGEVITY OF THEIR LIFE IS IT JUST THE PRESENCE OF THESE SYMPTOMS THAT SIGNALS THE ONSAID OF OF AM OF MEN APAUSOR IS IT SIR ARE THEIR ADDITIONAL CUSE LIKE FOR INSTANCE IF THEIR CYCLE IS GETTING SHORTER OR ETER YOU CERTAINLY WELL HAVE CYCHLE CHANGES AND WE CONSIDER THAT THE PERMEN APUZZLE PERIOD WHERE YOURE STARTING TO REALLY SART SEENG A SPACING OUT OF YOUR PERIODS SO THEY'RE NO LONGER COMING  THAT PERFECT OBULATORY PATTERN WHEN YOU GET INTO THE LOW OVERING RESERVE IT YOU'RE STILL OBULATING REGULARLY THEY FIRST SHORTEN AS WE SAID EARLYER BUT THEN WHEN THEY START LENGTHENING ARE YOUS ARE SKIPPING MUNS THAT'S A REAL BIG CLUE THAT THE THINGS ARE NOT GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND IF YOU FIND OUT YOU HAVE VERY VERY LOW OVEING RESERVE OR YOUR APPROACHING THAT PERYMEN APOS PERIOD YOU CAN SERC HAVE MORE PROLONGED PERIODS OF LOW ASTRAGEN AND YOU'LL FEEL MENTALLY CLOUDY FATIGUED MORE HEADACHES MORE HOT FLASHES LACALUBIDO THOSE VULLVARVAGINAL SOMTOMS OVER ALL MORE LIKELY TO O HAVE DEPRESSED MOOD AND AS LOT  LOT WELL MATALLY DOCTOR CRAWFORD I WANT TO EXTEND A HUGE THANK YOU ON HALF OF MYSELF I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH FROM YOU TO DAY AH ABOUT FERTILITY ABOUT HORMON HEALTH FOR WOMEN AND OU'VE ALSO

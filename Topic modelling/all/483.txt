WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANSCIENCE SCIENCEPACTI AM ANDREW HUBERMEN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NEURBIOLOGY AND OTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY MY GUEST IS DOCTOR DAVID SPEAGLE DOCTOR SPEAGLE IS THE ASSOCIATE CHAIR OF PSYCHIETRY IN BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES AT STAMFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDISCINE HE IS ALSO THE DIRECTOR OF THE STAMFORD CENTER ON STRESS AND HEALTH DOCTOR SPEAGLE IS BOTH A RESEARCHER AND A CLINITION MEANING HE RUNS A LABORATORY THAT STUDIES THE BRAIN AND THE BODY AND NEURAL MECHANISMS OF HOW THE BRAIN AND BODY INTERACT AND HE SEES PATIENTS AS A PSYCHIATRIST AT STAMFORD HIS WORK IS INCREDIBLY UNIQUE IN THAT IT BRIDGE'S MIND AND BODY BUT IT ALSO HAS A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF HYPNOSIS AS YOU'LL LEARN TO DAY HYPNOSIS IS A UNIQUE BRAIN STATE IN WHICH NEURL PLASTICITY THE BRAINS ABILITY TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE MAY BE HEIGHTENED AND INDEED THE USE OF CLINICAL HYPNOSIS BY DOCTOR SPEAGLE AND COLLEAGUES HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE SYMPTOMS OF STRESS CHRONIC ANXIETY CHRONIC PAIN AND VARIOUS OTHER ILLNESSES INCLUDING MANY PSYCHEATRICALNESSES AND EVEN OUTCOMES IN CANCER TODAY WE DISCUSS HYPNOSIS IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT'S CALLED SELF HYPNOSIS TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM STAGE HYPNOSIS MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH STAGE HYPNOSIS WHICH IS REALLY ABOUT A HYPNOTIST GETTING A PERSON TO DUE THINGS THAT A WOULD NOT OTHERWISE DUE IN CONTRAST CLINICAL HYPNOSIS AND THE USE OF HYPNOSIS FOR THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS AILMENTS OF MIND AND BODY IS VASTLY DIFFERENT IT INVOLVES GETTING PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR BRAIN STATE AND TO USE THAT BRAIN STATE AS A PORTAL TO MAKE A JUSTMENTS IN THEIR BRAIN AND BODY AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THEIR BIOLOGY AN PSYCHOLOGY THAT BENEFIT THEM AND IT'S BEEN SHOWN OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN STUDIES BY DOCTOR SPEAGLE AND COLLEAGUES THAT THOSE CHANGES CAN OCCUR EXTREMELY QUICKLY NOW NOT EVERYBODY CAN BE HYPNOTIZED AS READILY AS THE NEXT AND SO TO DAY WE ALSO DISCUSS A SIMPLE TEST DEVELOPED BY DOCTOR SPEAGLE THAT CAN HELP YOU DETERMINED WHETHER NOT YOU HAVE A HIGH MEDIUM OR LOW DEGREE OF WHAT WE CALL HYPNOTIZE ABILITY DOCTOR SPEGLE IS TRULY AN EXPERT IN THE ASAREA HE HAS PUBLISHED OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY JOURNAL ARTICLES ONE HUNDRED AND SEVINTY BOOK CHAPTERS ON HYPNOSIS AND ON THINGS LIKE PSYCHOSOCIAL ONCOLOGY WHICH IS THE INTERACTION OF MIND AND BODY IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER AND CANCER OUTCOMES ON STRESS PHYSIOLOGY TRAMA AND OTHER ASPECTS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY HE'S PUBLISHED THIRTEEN BOOKS SO HE'S TRULY TH WORLD EXPERT IN HYPNOSIS AND CLENICAL APPLICATIONS OF HYPNOSIS FOR MIND AND BODY I'M CERTAIN THAT IN LISTENING TO TAYIS EPISODE YOUARE GOING TO LEARN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN AND BODY INTERACT ABOUT VARIOUS TREATMENTS FOR ALL SORTS OF COMMON AILMENTS OF MIND AND BODY AND YOU ARE GOING TO GET ACCES TO TOOLS IN PARTICULAR A TOOL THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY DOCTOR SPEAGLE WHICH IS THE REVERY AP R E V E R EY THE REVERYAP IS CURRENTLY ONLY AVAILABLE FOR APPLE BUT WILL SOON ALSO BE AVAIL ABLE FOR ANDROID IT DOES CARRY A NOMINAL COST BUT THERE IS A SEVENDAY FREE TRIAL IF YOU LIKE TO TRY IT WERE PROVIDING A LINK IN THE SHOWNOTES THE REVERY APIS SPECIAL AN THAT IT IS BASED ON CLINICAL STUDIES AND RESEARCH DONE IN THE SPEAGAL LAB AT STAMFORD SO UNLIKE A LOT OF HYPNOSIS APS OUT THERE AND RESOURCES FOR HYPNOSIS IT WAS DEVELOPED WITH CLINICAL TREATMENTS IN MIND TODAY WE ALSO DISCUSS THE USE OF BREATHWORK AND I'M VERY FORTUNATE THAT MY RESEARCH LABAT STAMFORD HAS BEEN COLABORATING VERY CLOSELY WITH DOCTOR SPEAGL IN TESTING AND DEVELOPING SPECIFIC BREATHWORK PROTOCALLS TO ADJUST MINE IN BODY FOR THINGS LIKE ANXIETY IMPROVING MOOD AND IMPROVING SLEEP BASED ON HIS INCREDIBLE AND UNIQUE EXPERTICE AND THE CLARITY WITH WHICH DOCTROSPEAGAL COMMUNICATES INFORMATION I ANTICIPATE THAT YOU WILL REALLY ENJOY TO DAY'S EPISODE AND THEY LL COME AWAY FROM IT WITH A LOT OF ACTIONABLE TOOLS SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE CURIOUS WHAT A CLINICAL HYPNOSIS SESSION LOOKS LIKE AND FOR THAT REASON WE HAD DOCTOR SPEAGAL HYPNOTIZE ME A CLIP OF THAT HYPNOSESCESSION IS GOING TO BE POSTED TO THE HUBERMAN LAP CLIPSE CHANNEL WHICH IS AVAILABLE ON YOU TO BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D

DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR DAVID SPEAGLE DAVID THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND DREW MY PLEASURE CAN YOU TELL US WHAT IS HYPNOSIS AH HYPNOSIS IS A STATE OF HIGHLY FOCUSSED ATTENTION I IT'S SOMETHING LIKE LOOKING THROUGH THE TELEPHONALENDS OF A CAMERA IN CONSCIOUSNESS WHAT YOU SEE OU SEE WITH GREAT DETAIL BUT DEVOID OF CONTEXT AM IF YOU'VE HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF GETTING SO CAUGHT UP IN A GOOLD MOVI THAT YOU FORGET YOUR WATCH IN MOVIENT INTER THE IMAGINE WORLD YOUR PART OF THA MOVIG NOT PART OF THE AUDIENCE YOUR EXPERIENCING IT YOU'RE NOT EVALUATING IT THAT'S A HYPNOTIC LIKE EXPERIENCE THAN MANY PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR EVERY DAY LIVES SO IS ANY EXPERIENCE THAT REALLY DRAWS US IN HYPNOTIC IN THAT SENSE OR AM  ME GIVE A DIFFERENT A EXAMPLE IF I'M WATCHING A SPORTS GAME AND I'M REALLY WRAPPED UP IN THE GAME BUT I 'M ALSO IN TOUCH WITH HOW IT MAKES ME FEEL IN MY BODY CON A REGISTRING YOU KNOW THE EXCITEMENT ARE THE ANTICIPATION IS THAT A STATE OF HYPNOSIS ALSO BECAUSE YOU MENTION THERE'S KIND OF AN A A NARROWING OF CONTEXT BHUT A KOND OF LOSING OF THE SELF OR'S IT IS DO HAVE THAT RIGHT YES IT IS TRUE THAT YOUR IT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOURS  SOMATIC YOUR BODY EXPERIENCE IS A PART OF THIS THE SPORT EVENT THAT YOU'RE ENGAGED WITH I'D SAY THAT IS A SELF ALTERING HYPNOTIC EXPERIENCE IF YOUR PHYSICAL REACTIONS ARE DISTRACTING YOU OR A MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S WHEN I IT'S IT'S LESS HYPNOTIC LIKE AND MORE JUST ONE OF A SERIES OF EXPERIENCES OKA SO I HAVE TO ASK HOW DO YOU GET INTO THIS BUSINESS OF HYNOSIS BECAUSE AM I THINK FOR MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY HEAR HYPNOSS FOR THEY THINK ABOUT HYPNOSA THINKING OF STAGE SHYPNOSIS AND I THINK OF SOMEBODY WITH A PENDENT GOING BACK AND FORTH OF PEOPLE UPON A STAGE AM YOU BEHAVING ABNORMALLY FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF OTHERS YE AM HOW DID YOU GET INTO HYPNOSIS AS AN INTEREST AS A PRACTIS AM AND IF YOU WOULD COULD YOU CONTRAST THE SORT OF HYP NOSISS THAT YOU DO IN THE CLINICAL SATTING WITH THE ORT OF HYPNOSIS S THAT A STAGE HYPNOTIS SURE WELL AM IT IS SOMETHING OF A GENETIC ILLNES IN MY FAMILY OF BOTH OF MY PARENTS WERE SECHIATRIS AND PSYCHOANALIST AND THEY TOLD ME I WAS FREE TO BE ANY KIND OF SE KIATRIS I WANTED TO BE SO HERE I AM AM MY FATHER A WAS TRAINING TO BE A CYCHOANALYST IN NINETEEN FORTY A THREE AND AM HE A RAN INTO A VIENY'S REFUGE HE WHO COULDN'T SERVE IN THE ARMY BUT WHO HAD STUDIED HYPNOSIS AND ACTUALLY IT WOULD INTEREST YOU IN DOING YOUROPTHEMOLOGICAL RESEARCH HE HAD A A SMALLPOX CORT RIGHT THE MIDDLE OF HIS FOREHEAD AND HE DID FOR INSINCT EXAMINATIONTS AND HE NOTICED THAT SOME OF THE PRISONERS WOULD FOCUS ON THAT SPOT ON THIS FOREHEAD AND THEN CLOSED THEIR EYES AND SEEMED TO GO TO SLEEP BUT THEY WERE IN SOME ALTERED STATE SO HE GOT INTERESTED IN HYPNOSIS HE USED IT FOR INSICALLY AND HIS NAME WAS GUSTAP ON ASCHAPINBERG AND AM HE OFFERD TO TEACH YOUNG SOCIETRIS HOW TO USE HYPNOSIS WHEN THEY WENT OFF NINTO THE WAR AND SO HE TRAINED MY FATHER A AND HE MY FATHER GOT OFF THE ANALYTIC COUCH AND ASKED YO MEN E THETHE ANALIST MENTIONED IT TO HIM THAT I WE FOUND OUT ABOUT IT AND MY FATHER SAID DID I SAY SOMETHING WRONG IN AN ALYSIS WISELY TALKING TO ME OH AND AM HE FOUND IT VERY USEFUL IN HELPING SOLDIERS WHO ATICUTE PAIN WHEN THEY WERE WOUNDED AND HELPING PEOPLE WITH CONVERSION POST DROMATIC STRESS DISORDERS AND WHEN HE CAME BACK HE WENT BACK TO HIS TRAINING A BUT AM HE STILL A SORT OF INTERESTED IN IT AND HE  HAD HIS ONE OF HIS SUPERVISERS WAS FREEDOR FROM RACMEN WHO WAS A VERY FAMOUS PSYCHOLANALIST AND HE HE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD TO STOP DOING HYPNOSIS BECAUSE HET WOULD RUIN HIS REPUTATION AS AN ANLIST AND SHE SET HIM WHAT HE IS SO WORRIED ABOUT YOUR REPUTATION FOR YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE A COURSE AT THE INSTITUTE IN HYPNOSIS AND I KNOW YOU RENG TO DO IT BECAUSE I AM GOING TO TAKE IT SO HE WAS TEACHING FREEDOM FROM RAKMEN IFPNOSIS AND HE JUST KEPT DOING AND AND AFTER A WHILE HE DISCOVERED THAT HE WAS GETTING BETTER RESULTS WITH A FEW SESSIONS OF HYPNOSIS THAN HE WAS WITH DAILY CYCHOANALYSIS WITH HIS PATIENCS AND SO HE SWITCHED HIS  PRACTICE AND SO THE DINNER TABLE CONVERSATIONS WER PRETTY INTERESTING ND CASIONALLY WHEN HE WAS MAKING A MOVI OF A PATIENT I WOULD GET TO WATCH THAT AND SO WHEN I A WENT TO MEDICAL SCHOOL I FORGET ALL TAKE OF COURSE THAT WITH TOM HACKET HO WAS TA CHERIS THE CITI MAS GENERAL WAS TEACHING IN WHO WAS A VERY INTERESTING COURSE AND THE DAY THAT CONVERTED ME WAS A I WAS DOING MY VROTATION O CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN BOSTON AND THE NURSIS TELLING ME A SPEAK O YOUR N EXPATIENT AS AN ASMATIC AND ROOM FOR THIRTY SEVEN OR SOMETHING AND I'M JUST FOLLOWING THE SOUND OF THE WEESIS DOWN THE HALL I GO IN THE ROOM TO A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL KNUCKLE'S WITE BOTH UPRIGHT IN BED STRUGGLING FOR BREATHU AN HEAR THE WEESING SHE'D TWICE SAID SUPTUTANEOUS UP AN EFFREN TO  WORK THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT GENERAL AN AS THESIA AND STARTING ORON STEROIS AND HER MOTHERS THER A CRYING AND AM I SAID I DONTKNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO SO I SAID ONT TO LEARN A BREATHING EXERCISE IFSHE KNODS AND A I GOT HER HADMOTIZED AND THEN I REALIZED WE HADN'T GON TO ASKM IN THE COURSE YET SO I MADE UP SOMETHING VERY COMPLEX I SAID EACH BREATH YOU TAKE WILL BE A LITTLE DEEPER AND LITTLE EASIER AND WITHIN FIVE MINUTES SHE'S LYING BACK IN BED HER NUNCLES AREN'T WHINE SHE'S NOT WEESING HER MOTHERS STOPPED CRYING THE NURSE RAN OUT OF THE ROOM AND THE INTURN MY INTURN COMES TO FIND ME AND I FIGURE HOUS GOING TO HAVING ON ABACK AND SAY NICE TOP SPEGL HE SAID THE NURSE HAS FILED TO COMPLAINT WITH THE NURSING SUPERVISER THAT YOU VIOLATED A MASSACHUSETTS LAW BY HYPNOTIZING A MINOR WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT AND I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WELL THAT'S NICE YOU KNOW I DOUBT THERE IS A LAW LIKE THIST SO THE INTERNS SAYS YOU GENT A HAVE TO STOP DOING THIS WITHER AND I SAID WHY HE SAID IT'S DANGEROUS I SAID YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE HER GENERALIZE THESU AND PUT HER ON SEROYS AND TALKING TO ERS DANGEROUS YOU KNOW SAID WELL YOU'L HAVE TO DO IT AND I SAI 'L TELL YOU WHAT TAKE ME OFF THE CASE IF YOU WANT BUT I'M NOT GOING TO TELL A PATION OF MIN ANYTHING I KNOW IS NOT TRUE SO THERE WAS A BATTLE OVER THE WEEK END ABOUT WHAT TO DO IN THE THE INTURN THE CHIEF RESIDET TANDING WERE ALL ARGUING ABOUT IT AND ON MONDAY THET CAME BACK WITH A RADICAL IDEA THEY SAID LET'S ASK THE PATIENT I DON'T THINK THAT EVER BEEN DONE TO CHILDREN'S  BEFORE AND SHE SAID ALL I LIKE THIS YOU KNOW SHE'D BEEN HOSTILIZE EVERY MONTH FOR THREE MONTH INSTAT IS THAS MADICUS SHE DID AT ONE SUBSEQUENT HOSTILISATION BUT AFTER THAT WENT ON TO STUDY TO BE A RESPIRATORY TERAPAS AND I THOUGHT THAT ANYTHING THAT CAN HELP A PATIENT THAT MUCH VIOLATE A NON EXISTIN MASSACHUSETTS LAW FRUSTRATE THE NURSING SUPERVISER HAD TO BE WORTH LOOKING INTO SO I JUST KEPT DOING IT I DISCOVERED THAT THEYWERE YOU KNOW EVER ALL MY CLASSMATES AND MEDICAL SCHOOL HAD JUST READ THE NEW ISSUED THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNERAL AND HAD SOME NEW MEDICATION TO SUGGEST AND I WOULD YOU NO SURGEONS WOULD SAY LOOK IF YOU CAN HELP THIS GUIDE WITH THIS PAING OR IS ANXIETY ANYTHING ABOVE THE NECK THAT'S YOURS DO IT SPEGLE SO YOU KNOW I WAS HAVING FUND AND BEING ABLE TO LEARN HOW TO HELP PEOPLE AND AWAY THAT JUST OTHERWISE WAS NOT BEING DONE AND SO IT GOT ME THINKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE BORN WITH THIS PRAIN BUT WE DON'T HAVE A USERS MANUAL FOR IT AND WE DON'T USE IT YEARLY AS WELL AS WE CAN AN THAT SOMETHING YOUR RESEARCHES ALL ABOUT TOO AND AND SO I THOUGHT I WANT TO CO WONT UNDERSTAND THIS BETTER AND I WANT TO SEE WHERE WE CAN DO STAGE HIPMENT TAS STRIVE ME NOTS YOU KNOW THEY THEY MAKE FOOLS AUT OF PEOPLE AM THERE WAS ONE A MIGHT MIHT THIS A CASE MY FATHER WAS IN WILE HE GOT A CALL FROM EHE WAS OT COLUMBIA HE GOT A CALL SPEAKE YOU GOT A COME SE THIS WOMAN SHES IN THE YARE AND SHES IN SOME KIND OF WEIRD UPSET STADY THAT AM HAPPEN AND AT TURNED OUT SHE'D BEEN ON THO SHOW WITH THE STAY SHYPNOTIST A WHO AND WHAT THEY DO BY THE WAYS THEY THEY CYCHAL AROUND YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW THEY DON' DUSCRIBED SOMEBODY ANCE THEY WERE DOING THIS THEY GET A BUNCH OF PEOPLE UP THEY DO WHAT AMOUNT ST HYPEOTIZABILITY TESTING TO SEE IF PEOPLE AND THEY THEY GET THE ONES WHO ARE THE MOST HYPNOTIZABLE SO SHE WAS THE ONE AND HE SAID THERE'S NOW AA LITTLE BIRD IN YOUR HAND AND YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY WITH A BIRD AND SHE STARTS TO CRY AND SCREAM AND HE JUST GETS HER OFF THE STAGE CAUSE IT'S VERY UPSETTING AND SHE'S WANDING ROUND NEW YORK CITY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT DISSOCIATED AND BROUGHT TO CLUMBIAND THAT'S WHERE MY FATHER SOR SHE WAS STILL IN A KIND OF UNCOMFORTABLE TRANSLEX STATE AND IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE WAS THE TROPHY WIFE OF A VERY WEALTHY GUYE AND SHE FELT LIKE A BIRD IN A GILDED CAGE AND SO TO HER THAT IMAGE JUST TRIGGERET ALL OF THIS SENSE OF DISSATISFACTION AND DISCOMFORT FEAR ABOUT HER LIFE AND HE WAS ABLE TO GET HER RYOUR ANTED AND TALK WHETHER ABOUT WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO DO WITH HER LIFE BUT I DON'T LIKE STAGE HYPNOSIS YOU MAKIN FOOLS OUT OF PEOPLE M AND YOU'RE USING THE FACT AND THAT'S WHAT SCARCE PEOPLE ABOUT HYPNOSIS THEY THINK YOU'RE LOSING CONTROL YOURE GAINING CONTROL SELFHAGNOSIS IS A WAY OF ENHANCING YOUR CONTROL OVER YOUR MIND AND YOUR BODY IT CAN WORK VERY WELL BUT BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU A KIND OF COGNITIV FLEXIBILITY YOU'RE ABLE TO SHIFT SETS VERY EASILY YOUTO GIVE UP JUDGING AND VALUATING THE WAY YO USUALLY DO AND SEE SOMETHING FROM A DIF DIFFERENT POINT OF YOU THAT'S A GREAT THEIRAPEUTIC OPPORTUNITY BUT IF MISUSED IT COULD BE A DANGER TO AND THAT'S WHAT SCARCE PEOPLE ABOUT IT IT IT IS THAT VERY ABILITY TO SUSPEND CRITICAL JUDGMENT AND JUST HAVENANG EXPERIENCE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS THAT CAN BE A GREAT THEIR APEUTIC OPPORTUNITY BUT IF SOMEBODY'S MISS USING IT IT CAN BE AWAY TO AR PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE PLENTY OF EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE HAVING FANTASIES IMPOSED ON THEM THAT THEY COME TO THINK O REALITYS IT'S NOT UNUSUAL THESE DAYS SO UM IT'S IT'S AN ABILITY THAT IF PEOPLE LEARNED TO RECOGNIZE AND UNDERSTAND IT CAN BE A TREMENDOUS SIRPUTER COUEL I'VE BEEN STAGE HYPNOTIZED UM AND I'VE BEEN CLENICALLY HYPNOTIZED MANY TIMES UM THROUGH A SELF HAPNOSIS OT I WILL TOK UT LATER AND UM AND THENI KNOW WE HAVE PLANS FOR YOU TO HYPNOTIZE ME TO DAY YOU'VE DONE IT ONCE BEFORE UM AND M IDN'T VERY HYPNOTIZABLE ASE WE BOTH KNOW I IM YO WILL TALK ABOUT HOW ONE CAN ENGAGE THEIR HYPNOTIZE ABILITY SHORE BUT THE STAGE HYPNOSIS UM WAS INTERESTING THIS IS IN COLLEGE SHOU KNOW THEY BROUGHT SOMEONE OUT TO THE DORMATORY AND A I RECALL BEEN ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WAS SELECTED UM AND A AND BEENGAGING IN VERY BAZAAR BEHAVIOUR RIGHT IT WASN'T THOROUGHLY EMBARRASSING BUT IT WAS PRETTY EMBARRASSING AND THEND BEING SENT OFF THE STAGE AND AS I WAS EXITING SUDDENLY SCREAMING SOMETHING OUT BECAUSE HE HED PLANTED A SUGGESTION OF SOME SORT IM AND THEN I WAS TOLD TO LOOK IN MY POCKET AND THERE WAS IT LIKE A I THINK A TORN UP DOLER BIL L THERE A BUNCH OF THINGS THAT I HAVE VAGUE RECOLLECTION OF BUT IT RAISES IT OF A SET OF QUESTIONS A THAT REALLY BOIL DOWNS YOU YOU KNOW IT AS A BYALE JUST ALWAYS THINK THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S NO THERE'S NO EVENTS IN THE BRAIN THEIR THEIR PROCESSIES AND SO HYPNOSIS WE KNOW HAS AN INDUCTION THEN ONE IS HYPNOSTIZED I IMAGINE AND THEN ISELDS LIKE THIS WOMAN IN THIS EXAMPLE OF THE THE BIRD ON AN BEING IN BEING DISTRAUGHT IN YORK CITY IS A FAILURE TO EXIT THE HY HYPNOOTIC STATE DO WE KNOW WHAT SORTS OF BRAINAREAS ARE ACTIVE DURING THE INDUCTION THE LET'S CALL THE DEEP HYPNOSIS AND THEN WHATS SHUTTING OFF FOR CHANGING AS PEOPLE EXIT HYPNOSIS YES YES WE DO WE STUDY THAT WE VERY INTERESTED IN THAT AND SO WE A DID A STUDY WHERE WE SELECTED HIGHLY AND NON HYPNOTIZABLE PEOPLE SO WE COULD DO THE COMPARISON AND THEN HYPNOTIZE HIM IN THE FUNCTION ON OUR EYE SCANNER AND WE FOUND THREE THINGS CHARACTERIZE THE INTERY INTO THE HYPNOTIC STATE THE FIRST IS TURNING DOWN ACTIVITY IN THE DORSAL INTOR SINGULAR QURTEX SO THE DA SE IS IN THE CENTRAL FRONTMENTAL PART OF THE BRAIN AS YOU YOU WELL KNOW AND IT'S IT'S PART OF WHAT WE CALLED TA SAILINGS NETWORK I IT'S A E CONFLICT DETECTOR SO IF YOURE YOU KNOW A ENGAGED IN WORK AND HERE ALLOWED NOISE THAT YOU THING MIGHT BE A GUNSHOT THAT'S YOUR INTEOUR SINGULATE QUARTEX SAYING HAY WAIT AM IN UTE THIR SUBPOTENTIAL DANGER EVER THERE YOU BTTER PAY ATTENTION TO IT SO IT SAY IT COMPARES WHAT YOU'RE OING WITH WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON AND HELPS YOU DECIDE WHAT TO DO AND AS YOU CAN IMAGIN A TURNING DOWN ACTIVITY IN THAT REGION MAKE IT LESS LIKELY THAT YOU'LL BE DISTRACTED AND PULLED OUT OF WHATEVER YOUARE IN AND IN ANOTHER STUDY WE FOUND THAT HIGHLY YPNOTIZABLE PEOPLE EVEN WITHOUT FEELING BEING HYPNOTIZED HAVE MORE FUNCTIONAL CONACTIVITY BETWEEN THE DC C THE INTER SINGULAR QUARTE AND THE LEFT OR SOLADA PREFRONTAL QUARTEX O SO WHICH IS PART OF THE A KEY REGION IN THE EXECUTIVE CONTROLL THAT WORK SO WHEN YOU'RE ENGAGING AND TASK HERE CANT ENACTING A PLAN YOUR WRITING AN PAPER YOU'RE DOING WHAT EVERYOU'RE DOING THAT'S THE INTHE PREFINAL QUARTEX IS DOING THAT AND SO IF THAT IS COORDINATED WE FOUND MORE FUNCTIONAL QORNAC A CONACTIVITY SO WHEN ONE IS UP THE OTHERS UP WHEN ONE IS DOWN THE OTHERS DOWN THAT COORDINATION IMPLIES THAT THE BRAIN IS SAYING OKET GO AHEAD I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING CARRY OUT THAT PLAN AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT OTHER POSSIBILITIES SO TWO OTHER THINGS HAPPEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE HYPNOTIZED ONE IS THAT THAT DEELPI OF SE HAS HIGHER FUNCTIONAL CONACTIVITY WITH THE INSOLA ANOTHER PART OF THE SAILINGS NET WORK ITS A PART OF THE MIND BODY CONTROL SYSTEM SENSITIVE TOO IT'S HAPPENING IN THE BODY ITS PART OF THE PAIN NETWORK IS WELL BUT IT'S ALSO A REGION OF THE BRAIN WHERE YOU CAN CONTROL THINGS IN YOUR BODY THAT YOU WOULDN'T THINK YOU COULD FOR EXAMPLE WE DID A STUDY YEARS AGO WHERE WE TOOK PEOPLE A I WERE HIGHLY HPNOTIZABLE HYPNOTIZE THEM AND TOLD THEM TO A MAD WE WENT ON IMAGINARY CULINARY TOUR SO A WE WOULD THEY WOULD EAT THEIR FAVOURITE FOODS AND WE FOUND THAT THEY INCREASE THEIR GASTRIC GASID SECRETION LIKE BY EIGHTY SEVEN PER CENT SO THEIR STOMACH WAS ACTING AS THOUGH WAS ABOUT TOGET I MEAN THERE WAS ONE WOMENT IT WAS SO VIVID FOR HER THAT HALF WAY THROUGH SHE SAID LET'S STOP I'M FULL YOU KNOW EATING THESE HAVINAN EVER E HAVING NEVER ACTUAL NO INCREDIBLE AND THEN WE GOT THEM TO RELAX AND THINK OF ANYTHING BUT FOOD OR DRINK AND WE GOT LIKE A FORTY PER CENT DECREASING GASTRIC GASI SECRETION SO THEY COULD AND THAT WAS DEALPE OF SEE THROUGH THE INSOLENT TELLING THE STOMACH YOU'RE GETTING FOOD OR YOU'RE NOT GETTING FROOID AND EVEN WE INJECTED THEM WITH PENTIGASTRON WHICH TRIGERS GASTRIC GASIBILITIES AND EVEN THEN IN TH HYPNOSIS CONDITION THAT HAD A NINETEEN PER CENT REDUCTION I GASTRIC GASID SO THE BRAIN HAS THIS AMAZING ABILITY TO CONTROL WAS GOING ON IN THE BODY AND WAYS THAT WE DON'T THINK WE HAVE ABILITY O CONTROL THAT'SJUST WEN EXAMPLE SO THAT'S TO DEAL PIEV THE INSOLENT CONNECTION THE THIRD THING THAT HAPPENS AND THIS RELATES TO WHAT YOU DID ON THE STAGE IS YOU HAVE INVERSE FUNCTIONAL CONACTIVITY BETWEEN THE DEALPE OF SEE AND THE POSTERIERS SINGULAR QUARTEX THE POSTERIS SINGULAT I IS PART OF THE DEFAULTMODE NETWORKS IN THE BACK OF THE BRAIN IM AND IT'S IT'S IN ANAREA WHOSE ACTIVITY GOES DOWN FOR EXAMPLE IN MEDITATORS AND IN MEDITATION YOUR SUPOSED TO BE SELFLESS YOU SUPPOSE TO THESELF IS AN ILLUSION YOURE SPOSTO AT A DISSOLVE AND JUST EXPERIENCE THINGS AND WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT THE POSTER SING OF IS DECREASING IN ACTIVITY THE INVERSE CONNECTION IS I'M DOING SOMETHING BUT I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS FOR ME I MAY NOT EVEN REMEMBER MUCH OF IT IF I DO I DON'T CARE OF THAT MUCH ABOUT IT AND SO THAT IS PART OF THE DISSOCIATION THAT OCCURS WITH HYPNOSIS SO GET'S HOW YOU PUT THINGS OUTSIDE OF CONSCIOUS TO WARINESS AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS IT ALSO ADS TO COGNANTOFLEXIBILITY YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE THINKING WELL PEOPLE LIKE ME DON'T USUALLY DO THIS THAT MAY INHIBIT YOU FROM IN ACTING A NEW FORM OF SYCHOTHERAPY FOR EXAMPLE THAT YOU'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE IM BUT IF YOUR HAVING THIS DECREASED ACTIVITY IN THE PARTY OU BRAIN THE REFLECTS ON WHAT IT MEANS I YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE POGNABELY FLEXIBLE AND WILLING TO GIVE IT A TRY AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THIRAPUTIC ADVANTAGES OF HYPNOSIS AS WELL FASCINATING AND IT'S REALLY A EM TO PUT M AN EMBARRASS YOU HERE A LITTLE BIT OM POSITIVE SENSE IT'S AT YOUR LABORATORY IS REALLY THE THE ONE THAT'S PIONEERED BRAIN IMAGING OF HYPNOTIC STATES AND OM IT SOUNDS LIKE IT THAT'S MY UNDER STANDING IS THAT E A CARAGIA I MEAN THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE THAN EXCELLENT RESEARCH TOO OR BUT THE ARRAINGELL AND MUNTRY ALL AN SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE BUT WE'RE ONE OF THE LEADING LAMPSON AND NUR IMAGING IF HIPNOSIS I HAVE TO ASK ABOUT ATTENTION DEFISIT O PENACTIVITY DISORDER I GET A LOT OF A QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE TO STRUGGLE WITH HOLDING ATTENTION NOWADAY IS BECAUSES OF A IT BE ANO INTERFERENCE WITH PHONES AND DEVICES AND AND I OF COURSE THERE IS A LOT OF A CLINICALLY LEGENTIMATE EIGHTY EIGH TY OUT THERE BUT THE WAYT OR DESCRIBE THE AM DORSILY INTER SINGULAT AND THE SAILINGS NETWORK IN THIS A CONFLICT ATTACTOR OF YOU KNOW ET  MY FOCUSSING ON SOMETHING OVER MY SPLITTING MY ATTENTION HOW DISTRACTABLE MI SEEMS TO RELATE TO SOME EXTENTO ACTIVITY IN THE DORSE A INTERA SINGULAR QUARTEX A DO PEOPLE WITH EIGHTY EIGH TO AM DIS PLAY DESRUPTIONS AN ELEMENTS OF THESE NET WORKS AND A HAS HYPNOSIS EVER BEEN USED TO A FOR SELF HYPNOSISS I SHOULD BE UM TIS DISTINGUISH FROM A STATESHIPNESS AS CLINICAL AND SELF HYPNESS HAS BEEN USED TO ENHANCE PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO FOCUS AND WHOLD ATTENTION AM BECAUSE THAT SUCH A BUILT AN COMPONENT OF THE HYPNOTIC STATE IT IT'S A GREAT QUESTION THERE ARE THERE'S SORT OF TWO WAYS TO THINK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF ENHANCING FOCUS YES IT HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL AM IN TEACHING PEOPLE TOD JUST PREPARE YOUR MIND TO NARROW AND IN FOCUS ON SOMETHING AND WHEN IU KNOW WHEN YOUARE REALLY ENGAGED IN READING SOMETHING OR YOU'RE WRITING A PAY IMA I'LL HAVE THAT SOMETIMES I'MTHING O GOD I I HAVE TO DO THIS FOR ANOTHER HOUR OTHER TIMES AN HOUR GO BY AND OTHIC HAGREAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT IT FEELS GAMELIKE TO YOU KNOW YOU'RE JUST ASSEMBLING THE PARTS OF THE PUZZLE AND PUTTING HIM TOGETHER IT'S FUND YOU JUST GET ABSORBED THAT FOR ME THAT'S A HYPNOTIC LIKE EXPERIENCE WHEN I'M HAVEN'T TROUBLE WHEN I'M STRUGGLING SOMETIMES DOING THINGS LIKE SOF HYPNOSIS CAN HELP I'M NOT AN EXTRAT ON EIGHTY H T AM MY IMPRESSION IS THAT YOUE WRIHT THAT THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSTANTLY DISTRACTED AND AND RATHER RIGID THE OTHER PART OF IT IS THEY'RE EASILY DISTRACTABLE THE VERY UPSET WHEN THEY GET DISTRACTED AND A RATHER RIGID AND WHAT THEY WANT TO WOULD TEN TO IN WHAT THEY CAN'T I THINK IF THA WAY OF CONTROLLING THIS DISTRACTABILITY FRANCTLY AH I MY GUESS IS THAT MANY PEOPLE WITH ATY ETY WOULD NOT BE THAT HYPNOTIZABLE BUT I HAVEN'T IVENT STUDIED IT SO A IT IT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE WITH THAT DISORDER TRAINING IN SELF HYPNOSIS MYT HELP BUT WE'D HAVE TO SEE HOW HYPNOTIZABLE THEY WERE AND TAKE IT FROM THERE THE WANT A RETURN TO SOME OF THE UNDERLYING NERL NETWORKS AND THE A CLINICAL APPLICATIONS BUT A WHAT SORTS OF AM THINGS ASIDE FROM THE ASMA AM HAVE YOU USED HYPNOSIS SUCCESSFULLY FOR AT OR HAVE OTHERS USED CLINICAL HYPNOSIS UM FOR AND ARE THERE ANY PARTICULAR AREAS OF OF PSYCHIATRIC CHALLENGES ARE ILLNESSAS I GUESS ARE CALLED AM THAT ARE PARTICULARLY AM AMENABLE TO HYPNOTIC TREATMENT YES THERE ARE HYPNOSIS IS VERY GOOD AS A PROBLEM FOCIS A TREATMENT AM IT'S REALLY TS THE OLDEST WESTERN CONCEPTION OF A PSYCHLOTHERAPY AND IT CAN BE USED FOR SPECIFIC PROBLEMS AND A WAY THIS VERY HELPFUL A WEVE FOUNDED VERY HELPFUL FIRST DRES REDUCTION AM FOR HELPING PEOPLE THE AL WERL OLD DEAL IN WITSTRESS THESE DAS IM AND IT'S HELPFUL THAT MIND BODY CONNECTION IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE IM PART OF THE PROBLEM WISTRESS IS YOUR PERCEPTION YOU MENTION IT EARLIER IN A SUT A GOOD SENSE YOURE THE YOU KNOW FOOTBUL GAMBER SOMETHING AND YOU FEEL THE PHYSICAL REACTION THAT CAN BE A REINFORCING THING WHILE THIS IS EXCITING LETS DO IT IT CAN ALSO BE VERY DISTRACTING SO YOURE WORRIED ABOUT GETTING COVET OR YOUR WORRIED ABOUT A SO'M OTHER PHYSICAL PROBLEM YOU HAVE AND YOU NOTICE IT IN YOUR BODY YOU RODY TANCES UP IU START TO SWEAT THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM GO AS YOUR HARRADE GOES UP AND WHEN YOU NOTICE THAT YOU THINK O GOD THIS IS REALLY BAD AND THEN YOU FEEL WORSE SO IT'S LIKE A SNOWBOLL ROLLING DOWN HILL IAND AND THEN YOU FEEL WORSE AND THEN YOUR BODY GETS WORTH IF NOSIS CAN BE VERY HELPFUL IN DISSOCIATING SOMADIC REACTION FROM PSYCHOLOGICAL REACTION SO WE TEACH PEOPLE TO IMAGINE THEIR BODY FLOATING SOMEWHERE SAFE AND COMFORTABLE LIKE A BATH TO LAKE A HOT OFER FLOATING IN SPACE AND THEN PICTURE THE PROBLEM THAT THER DISTRESSING THEM ON AN IMAGINARY SCREENE WITH HE RULEING OA MOUTER WHICH O SEE ON THE SCREEN YOU KEEP YOUR BODY COMFORTABLE SO AT THIS POINT YOU CAN'T YOU STILL CAN'T CONTROL DISTRESS BUT YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR PHYSICAL REACTION TO IT AND THAT START YOU FEELING MORE IN CONTROL LEAST THIRS ONE THING I CAN MANAGE AND THEN YOU CAN USE IT TO THINK THROUGH WERE VISUALIZE THROUGH ONE THING YOU MIGHT DO ABOUT THAT STRESSOR SO IF NOSIS IS VERY HELPFUL IN CONTROLLING MIND BODY INTERACTION AN RELATION DISTRESS IM IT'S VERY HELPFUL FOR PEOPLE TO GET TO SLEEP A GRE HAVING A LOT OF FUN WITH THAT I II'M GETTING YOU MASE FROM PEOPLE WHO SAID YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T SLEPT RIGHT FIFTEEN YEARS AND NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME M YOU KNOW I'M LISTENING YOUR A AND I CAN SLEEP AT NIGHT YOU KNOW SO IT'S VERY HELPFUL AND AGAINYOU KNOW IT IF YOU WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT YOU KNOW I I TELL PEOPLE DON'T LOOK AT THE CLOCK THAT'S AN AROUSE OL CUE YOU KNOW YOU JUST YOU WAKE UP MORE A BUT IMAT PICTURE WHATEVER YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT A WORRING ABOUT ON THAT IMAGINARY SCREEN WHILE YOUR BODIES FLOATING SO WATCH YOUR OWN MOVING BUT KEEP YOUR BODY FLOATING AND MANY PEOPLE CAN USE THAT TO GET BACK TO SLEEP I'VE BEEN USING THAT THAT SELF HAPNOSIS FOR SLEEP FOR A LONG TIME AM AND NOW THE REVERY AP ANOT WILL TALK ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP TO THE REVERYAP AN ITS USES I FIND INCREDIBLY USEFUL FOR FALLING BACK A SLEEP IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT AND AND IT RAISES THAT A QUESTION A I'VE FOUND AND I THINK I UNDERSTAND THE STRACTLY THAT ONE CAN DO SELF HAPNOSISTRIN THE DAYTIME AND THEN IF THERE'S AN ISSURE THAT COMES UP LATER LIKE SO FOR INSTANCE A DUESELF HAPNOSIS FOR STRESS REDUCTION AWAY FROM THE STRESSFUL OF THAT TO PREPARE ONE TO DEAL WITH STRESS BATTER OR DO I HYPNOSIS FOR IMPROVING THE RETURN TO SLEEP AND THAT CAN BE DONE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO GO TO SLEEP BUT IT'S THAT KIND OF A TRAINING UP OF THESE NETWORKS I ALL RIGHT IS SO IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT THESE BRING NETWORKS ACTUALLY FORM STRONGER A CONNECTIONS WHEN PEOPLE DOSELF HYPNOSIS OVER TIME A WELL THERE'S A RULE IN OROBIOLOGY AS YOU KNOW THE NURONS THAT FIRE TOGETHER WIRE TOGETHER AR SAN CARLI SHOTS YES GROT DONALD HAB BY THE WAY TON THERES  THERE'S A THERE'S A WIDES RED MYTH IN THE WORLD THAT A IS UNFORCING ALL OVER THE INTER NET WHICH IS THAT THE  FIRE TOGETHER WIRE TOGETHER WAT SAID BY THE PSYCHOLOGIST DONALD HAVE DONAL HAD TO MANY IMPORTANT THINGS BUT IT IS THE NEROBIL JUST CARLE SHAT SAS THE EGLE YES IS THAT STANDARD BUT WAS ALSO BIRKLY AND HARVARD SA THATS RO DECENT SCHOOLS A THAT BUT IS THAT A STANFORD A WHO SET FIRE TOGETHER WIRE TOGETHER AND A MAN DESERVES THE RIGTY CREDIT FOR THAT STATEMENT OF YES SO WITH REPEATED A USE OF SELF HYPNOSIS AM ONE COULD IMAGINE THAT THESE SNET WORKS ARE GETTING STRONGER I W I WOULD I WOULD THINK SO WE DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE OF THAT YET A BUT A YOU KNOW LONG TERNE PEDENTIATION A I PROVIDES A PATHWAY AND YOU DESCRIBE THEM ON YOUR PROGRAMM A NUMBER OF TIMES THAT ALLOW FOR REPEATED ACTIVATION OF A NET WOR TO ACTUALLY BUILD NEW CONNECTIONS THAT THAT WORK AND AT THE LEAST EVEN FROM A LEARNING IND MEMORY POINT OF VIEW YOU KNOW AR YOU KNOW' MEMORY IS ALL A NET WORK OF ASSOCIATIONS THAT'S HOW WE REMEMBER THINGS AM AND I YOU KNOW THAT THE EXAMPLE ID LIKE TO GIVE AS YOU GO BACK TO YOUR GREAT SCHOOL AND AND YOU SEE THESE LITTLE TINY LOCKERS AND THE NO SIZE IS ALL WRONG AND YOU SUDDENLY HAVE A FLOOD OF MEMORIES THAT YOU YOU R OBVIOUSLY STORED THERE BY YOU JUST IN THINK OF SO IT CONTEXT AND ASSOCIATION IS WHAT MEMRIES ABOUT IF YOU START TO A QUIRE MEMORIES ABOUT A PROBLEM SO ONE THING WE USE HYPNOSIS FOR IS TREATING POBIAS FOR EXAMPLE AND THE PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE PHOBIAS LIKE CAIRPLAIN POBIAS OR I YOU KNOW CROSSING A BRAGE OR BEING UP HIGH IS THAT THE MORE THEY AVOID IT THE MORE THE ONLY SOURCE OF ASSOCIATIONS AND MEMORIES IS THEIR FEAR THEY WON'T HAVE ANY GOOD EXPERIENCES WITH IT CAUSE THEY AVOID IT YOU MUST LIKE GET BACK ON THE HORSE AFTER FULL OF KIND OF THING AND AND WITH HYPNOSIS IF YOU CAN START PEOPLE ABLE TO MANAGE THERINXIETY ENOUGH THAT THEY CAN HAVE MORE A WIDER A RAY OF EXPERIENCES THEY START TO HAVE A NET WORK OF ASSOCIATIONS THAT ISN'T SO NEGATIVE AND MAY EVEN BE POSITIVE SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE A A SARRTY INTERRUP BUT I HAVE TO ASK IT'S IT'S AMOST LIKE A A EXPOSURE THER BE DONE IN THE MIND YET IT'S ALWAYS IN THE MIND I MEAN EVEN EXPLOSURE TO IF I HAVE A SNAKE PHOBI OT WHICH I I DON'T I  DON'T LIKE SNAKES BUT I DON'T THINK IT QUALIFIES AS A FULL BLOWN PHOBIA THING OF A HEALTHY FEAR OF SNAKE  A BUT IF LET SAY I HAD A SNAKE POBIA IT THAT TYPICAL AM E APPROACH IN A WOULD BE COGNO BEHAVIOURAL APROACHES RIGHT WOULD BE THAT SHOW A PICTURE OF A SNAKE AR THE A RUBBER SNAKE THAN REAL SING OF TVHENTUU EVERSONIS YOU KNOW A HOLDHING OF BO CONSTRICTOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT  WITH IT THAT'S ALL IN THE MIND BECAUSE THIT'S ALL TRANSLATE INTO NERVOUS SYSTEM SIGNALS UT WITH HYPNOSIS SOME THAT YOU CAN GIVE A NUMBER OF POSITIVE EXPERIENCES WITHOUT HAVING TO USE ANY PROPS WITHOUT HAVING TO BRING ANY ANIMALS INTO THE RANG I DRIVE SOME ONE ACROSS THE BRIDGE IS THAT RIGHT YES I HAD A WOMAN WHO WAS A VERY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS WOMAN HIGHLEVEL AND A CORPORATION I HAD A TERRIBLE DOG POBIA AND IM SO I HAD HER IMAGINE THAT SOMEBODY BROUGHT IN THE DOG TO THE ROOM ND I SAID WHAT YOU DOING AND YOU COULD SEE HER GETTING TENSE AND SHE SAID I'M WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE DOG DOES AND I SAID IF SOMEBODY WHO WORKS FOR YOU COMES IN TO YOUR OFFICE WOULD YOU FREEZE IN WAIT TO SEE WHAT THEY DID AND SHE SAID OF COURSE NOT I TELL HIM WHAT TO DO YOU KNOW AND I SAID WELL SO YOU REMOBLIZING YOURSELF THE POWERSN' WITH THE DOG IS WITH YOU SO IMAGINE MIGHT YOU MIGHT DO  TO ENGAGE THE DOG AND AND HELP CONTROL THE SITUATION AND SHE SAID THANKS AND AND THIS REMINDS ME ONE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE STORIES ABOUT HYPNOSIS THAT MY FATHER WAS SEEING A WOMAN AND WHO LIVED IN THE TOWN AN HADN'T AND HAD A HORRIBLE DOG POBIA AND SHE DROP THINGS SHE'D STILL COFFEE N IF SHE SAW A DOG SHE WOULD TIME HER TRIPS TO THE STORE WHEN SHE THOUGHT IT WAS LEAST LIKELY THE PEOPLEULD BE WOGING DOGS NOW THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLY I HAV EVERY ONE EVER RIK ILED LIKE A FLEET OF FRENCH BULL DOG RIGHT TAKEI H ANSWER ERSITY SO IM HE TAUGHT HER TO THINK OF DOG AS A FRIEND HAVE A NEIGHBOUR WHO HAD A DOG BRING THE DOG OVER BUT HOLD THE DOG BY THE COLLER AND MAKE SURE AND GRADUALLY SHE WAS ABLE TO STROKE THE DOG AND SAY DOG FRIEND AN DISTINGUISHED BETWEEN WILD AND TAME ANIMALS THERE ARE ANIMALS YOU SHOULD BE AFRAID OF IT SO SHE SEEMED TO BE DOING BETTER HE CALLED BACK ABOUT THREE MONTHS LATER AND ASKE FOR HER AND I SAID WELL WAS CALLING TO SUN SEDNEY SAID DOCTOR SPEAGLE AND THE BOYSHOOD THAT'S WEIRD AND MY FATHER SAID WHAT'S WEARD HE SAID SPEAGLES IN HEAT SHE SHE HAD BLOUGHT A DOG LOVIT AND AMED ITS FEEL TI A WILISH RANSFERCE I LOVE IT BUT BUT IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE POWER OF THIS AND I I BRINGS ME BACK TO THIS I ISSUE IUM SO WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT WHAT YOUR FATHER DID IN THAT CASE  WITH THIS  WITH THIS WOMAN IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN HYPNOSIS THAT ALLOWED HER TO GO FROM BEING COMPLETELY TERRIFIED OF DOGS TO OWNING A DOG AND TAY MA IT AFTER YOUR FATHER WIN I FINE AMUSING AH BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT THEND JUST THE TWO OF THEM SITTING DOWN AND TALKING ABOUT ITRIGHT I YOU KNOW IN THERAPY THER NARRATIVE IS A HUGE COMPONETMENT AND IN HYPNOSIS NARRATIVE AS A HUGE COMPONENT SO IT MUST BE THAT THE BRAIN STATE IS WHAT IS REALLY DIFFERENT BECAUSE IM WE'LL TALK ABOUT TRAMAN IN A FEW MINUTES BUT YO I THINK PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRAMA OR POBIAS CERTAINLY IM COULD HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT THEY SOME OF THEM MIGHT FREES UP SOME OF THEM MIGHT LOSE THEIR ARTICULATION AND SO FORTH BUT WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THAT STATE THAT COMBINES WITH NARRATIVE YOU THINK TO ALLOW THESE UNDER LYING YEROLN THAT WORKS TO TO ENGAGE HER TO CHANGE AS I FIND THIS SO FASCINATING BECAUSE IT WERE EVERY ATTEMPT THAT A A DEALING WITH STRASS AREPOBIA IN THE CLINICAL SETTING INVOLVE SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT IT IS IF BUT HERE WERE NOT TALING ABOUT ANY MEDICATION BEING INTRODUCED AT LEAST NOT IN THESE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANSIME SO I I JUST I VRELIZE ITS KIND OF AN OBVIOUS CUESSION LIKE THE HAS TO BE SOME DIFFERENCE IN BRAIN ACTIVITY BUT I FIND THAT TO BE INCREDIBLE THAT THE CONTROL VARIABLE THERE IS THE BRAIN STATE IT'S NOT WHAT SPOKEN YOU RAISING A COUPLE OF VERY IMPORTANT AS SHESE ANTO IM I KNOW WE WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT WOITH SYSTEMATIC THESE SENSITIZATION WHERE YOU YOU KNOW SOT OF LAY OUT OF HIERARCHY OF THINGS INTO ONE AT THE TIME I THINK OF THIS IS UNSYSTEMATIC TESE SANSITIZATION BECAUSE YOUR CHANGING MENTAL STATES AND IF AND I THINK THERE'S MORE AND MORE EVIDENCE THAT MENTAL STATE CHANGE ITSELF HAS THE REPUTE POTENTIAL WERE SEENG THAT WITH CETAMING TREATING DEPRESSION THE ESSOCIATEANIC DRUG A YE WE SEE I WE KNOW IT EVERY MORNING WHEN WE WAKE UP THAT PROBLEM WEY NOW YOU MAKE THE MISTAKE OF READING AN ASTI EMAIL AT ELEVEN PIAMA TO KNOW WHAT TO DO YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING THING OH THAT IDIOT I HERS WHEN I MENTO  YOU KNOWIG SO JUST CHANGING MENTAL STATE ITSELF HAS THE REPUTIC POTENTIAL AND I THINK WE UNDER ESTIMATE OUR ABILITY TO REGULATE AND EN CHANGE RESPONSES TO BE COGNITIVELY EMOTIONALLY AND SOMATICALLY FLEXIBLE AND SO WE DO THINGS YOU WRITE THAT FOLLOWS SIMILAR PRINCIPLES OF FACING A PROBLEM SEEING IT FROM A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW AND YOU'VE DONE A REALLY A NICE PODCAST ON PROM AND STRESS AND HOW YOU HAVE TO EXPOSE YOURSELF TO IT NOT AVOID AT AS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE AND THEN FIND SOME WAY TO RECONNECT TO IT TO SUBSTITUTE SOMETHING THAT CAN MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD RATHER THAN BAD OM SO THAT YOU ACTIVATE OTHER CENTERS OF THE BRAIN LIKE MESILINBE REWARD SYSTEM AND SO I DO THAT WITH HYPNOSIS AND YOU CAN DO IT MUCH FASTER PEOPLE DON'T THINK THEY CAN BUT THEY CAN IF YOUR HAVING RIGHT NOW THAT PHYSICAL EXPERIENCE I'M THINKING ABOUT THIS TAT I'M NOT FEELING HIS BAD AS I USED TO OM THAT CAN BE A POWERFUL THING AND YOU CAN DO IT WITH HYPNOSIS SO I HAD A WOMAN CAME TO SEE ME WHO HAD SUFFERED AN ATTEMPTED RAPE UT WAS GETTING DARK SHE WAS COMING BACK FROM THE GROCERY STORE IN THE SKY GRABS HURE AND ONCE TO GET HER UP INTO HER APARTMENTS OUTSET HER APARTMENT AND SHE STARTS FIGHTING WITH HIM AND SHE WINCS UP WITH A BASLER'S SKULL FRACTURE HE RUNS AWAY ON THE COPS COME SINCE SHE HADN'T BEEN RAE THEY LEFT THEY WERE AN INTERESTED AN SHE WANTED TO USIGNOSIS TO GET A BETTER IMAGE OF WHAT THE SKY LOOKED LIKE WHICH IS A PAINFUL UPSETTING THANKS SO SHE WAS QUITE YDNOTIZABLE I GOT HER FLOATING I SAE YOUR SAFE AND COMFORTABLE NOW NOTHING CAN HAPPEN THAT WILL HARM YOUR BODY BUT ON ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN I WANT YOU TO PICTURE THE SKY AND HIS APPROACHING AN WHAT'S HAPPENING AND SHE SAID I REALLY IF THE LIGHT WII WAS GETTING DARK I REALLY CAN'T SEE MUCH OF HIS FACEAL FEATURES BUT I DO RECOGNIZE SOMETHING I HADN'T ALLOWED MY SELF TO REMEMBER IF SHE GETS ME UPSTAIRS HE DOESN'T JUST WANT TO RIGTE ME HE'S CAN O KIL ME AND SO IN SOME WAYS WHAT SYE WAS SEEING WAS EVEN WORSE SO YET OW YOU'RE THINKING GOOD SPEAGLE YOU MADE HER EVEN MORE FRIGHTENED THAN SHE WAS BEFORE BUT AS YOU HAD POINTED OUT IN EUROPEAT ES THE STRESS LECTURE YOU'VE GOT TO CONFRONT THE TRAMA TO TO RESTRUCTURE YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF IT SO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN I HAD HER PICTURE IM IM WHAT WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO PROTECT YOURSELF AND EVERYBODY IN A TROMISE SITUATION ENGAGES IN SOME STRAGEGY OF PROSELF PROTECTION AN THAT'S THE SAILINGS THET WORK KICKING AND AND IM SHE SAID YOU KNOW WHAT HE SURPRISED AN OM FIGHTING THAT HEART HE DIDN'T THINK I WOULD AND SO SHE REALIZED ON THE ONE HAND THAT IT WAS EVEN WORSE THAN SHE THOUGHT IT WAS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT SHE ACTUALLY PROBABLY SAVED HER LIFE AND SO IT WAS A WAY OF HELPING HER RESTRUCTURE HER EXPERIENCE OF THE TRAMA AND MAKE IT MORE TOLERABLE SO THAT HELP WITH HER SHE DIDN'T RECKO SHE COULDN'T IDENTIFY THE GUIDE BUT IT HELPED HER RESTRUCTURE AND UNDERSTAND HER EXPERIENCE AND THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO IN JUST TALKING STRAIGHT OUT PSYCHOTHERAPY BUT SOMETIMES YOU CAN DO WHAT HELLIBA OT FASTURE AND MORE EFFICIENTLY USING HIPNOSIS AND THERE IS ONE RAND OF MY TRIAL OUT OF ISRAEL THAT SHOWS THAT ANDING HAP NOSIST TO PETES HE TREETMENT ACTUALLY IMPROVES OUTCOME SO A I ID IT'S A WAY OF ACCOMPLISHING THINGS THAT WE UNDERSTAND IN THE BROADER PSYCLE THERAPY WORLD BUT MUCH MORE QUICKLY AND AND SOMETIMES EFFECTIVELY TAT SONDS LIKE GOING INTO SOMEWHAT INTO THE STATES THAT ONE IS TRING TO DEAL WITH BUT THEN DISSOCIATING FROM THAT STATE IS KEY AND I CAULD IMAGINE I AND  NOT BEEN OPEN ABOUT THE S ON VERY SPOT CAST O E'M DONE A LOT OF I AND AND ALCESS OVER THE YEARSO ANBUDY I EXPERIENCE MYSELF THAT IN IN THO SESSIONS DEPENDING ON HOW I SHOW UP TO THEM I MIGHT JUST GET IN KIND OF A LAUNDRY LEST OF WHAT HAPPENED AS A POSTACHLY FEELING ANYTHING ROUND WHAT HAPPENED  IM AND I THINK PEOPLE PROBABLY VARY IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH STATE CAN DROP INTO FEELING STATES AND IT CAN DEPEND ON THE DAY IT CAN BE DEFOUND OND HOW WELL SA YOU SLEPT THE NIGHT BEFORE AND SO ON THERE THES WANETING I MIGHT AND AND AN THAT IS YOU KNOW THERE'S A NOTION THE LATE GORDON BOWER HE DIDD WE JUST HAD A MEMORIAL FOR GORDON IM AT STANDFORD HE DIED ABOUT A YEAR AGO BRILLIANT CAGANA PSYCHOLOGISM WHEN THE FOUNDERS OF COGNAN OF PSYCHOLOGY AAT STANDFORD AND AND A GREAT PICTURE HE LMOST HE ALMOST BECAME A MAJORLY PICTURE BUT HE DECIDED TO GO TO GRASCAL INSTEAD AND I'M I'M GLAD HE DID IM BUT GORDON I HELPED ESTABLISH THE CONCEPT OF STATE DEPENDENT MEMORY THAT WHEN YOUR INNOCCERTAIN MENTAL STATE YOU ENHANCE YOUR BILITY REMEMBER THINGS ABOUT IT AND THE SOOT OF THE BAD EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THE DRUNK WHO HIDES THE BOTTLE AND CAN'T REMEMBER WHERE HE PUT IT UNTIL HE GETS DRUNG AGAIN S IN THAT SAME MENTAL STATE PEOPLE GO INTO DISSOCIATIVE STATES A WHEN THEYR TRAMATIZE SO IN A WAY HYPNOSIS IS HELPING THEM REMEMBER AND DEAL WITH THE MEMORIES BETTER BECAUSE THEIR MORA IN THE MENTAL STATE THAT IS MORE LIKE WHAT HAPPENED AND MOST GREAT VICTIMS WILL TELL YOU I WAS FLOATING ABOVE MY BODY FEELING SORRY FOR THE WOMEN BEING ASSAULTED BELOW A A PEOPLE INTROMATIC EPISOCIATE JUST SAYG INOW I BLANK OUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPING ON ON AUDO PILOT AND THAT'S A KIND OF SELF HYPNOTIC STATE SO WHEN YOU USE HYPNOSIS TO HELP THEM DEAL WITH THE TRAMATIC MEMORY YOUR MAKING THE STATE THEREIN RIGHT THERE IN YOUR OFFICE WITH YOU MORE CONGRUENT TO THE STATE THEY WERE LIKELY IN WHEN THE TRAMA HAPPENED AND I THINK THAT IS PART OF WHAT HELP'S FACILITATE TREATMENT OF TRAMA RELATED DISORDERS I SEE THAT ITS ME HAVE TO ASK EVERY QUESSION I HAVE TO ASK I BECAUSE I REALLY FEEL IT AS A ALMOST A COMPULSION THEN IF DISSOCIATION DURING A TRAMATIC EPISODE IS FOR IT'S PART OF THE ADAPT A STRATEGY RAM BUT IT CREATES CERTAIN ISSUES E CREATES PROBLEMS RIHT AM WHY WOULD SOMETHING LIKE KEDAMINE WHICH CREATES A DISSOCIATIVE STATE BE USEFUL FOR THE TREATMENT OF TRAMA THIS IS WHAT I I'M CONFUSED ABOUT THESE STAYS BECAUSES A OR COLLY CARLDI OR AUTHORS ALSO BEEN ON THE PARCASKS AND AND AND HIS CO WORKERS A FIGURED OUT I'L CAV THEREIS THESE LAYER ONE NETWORKS IN COURT IN THE NEO CORTAKS AND THOSE REVOLVED IN DESSOCI OF STATEANCS WERE STRYING TO GAIN SOME UNDERSTANDING OF HOW CEDAMEN WORKS AT A NERL LEVEL RI IT DOES SEEM A AS IF FOR CERTAIN POPULATIONS ITS A CAN BE A USEFUL TREATMENT I DON'T KNOW I NEVER TRIED IT I DONT NOW WHAT THE CURRENT STATUS OF THAT IS BUT IT IS LEGAL IT IS ALLOWD AT LEAST AND IT'S EVERYGAY PROVED AND IT'S IN USE WHY WOULD DISSOCIATE DISSOCIY OF STATES BE USEFUL IF THIS IF SOME ELEMENT OF DISSOCIATION IS WHAT A GAVE RISE TO THE TRAMA TROMA MEMORY IN THE FIRST PLACE WELL I YET CAR OF BRILLIANT PAPER IN NATURE WHERE HE IT WAS FROM FROM RATS TO HUMANS AND ONE PAPER AND HE SHOWED THAT THERE'S THIS RHYTHMIC DISCHARGE IN THE RETEROSPLANO REGION THAT IS ASSOCIATED THAT IS TRIGGERED BY CADEMINE AND AND THE RATS ACTUALLY SHOWED DES SOCIET OF LIKE BEHAVIOR IN THAT THEY WOULD TOUCH A HOT PED THAT THEY ORDINARILY WOULDN'T AND THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE MUCH PAIN IN THEIR PAW AND HE THEN HAD A A A MALE SUBJECT TO HAD A IMPLANTED ELECTORO HUMAN A HUMAN HAVE TOGE HUMAN SUBJECT AN AND A THE ELECTROTES HAD PICKED UP THIS RHYTHMIC ACTIVITY AND WHEN THEY DID HE WOULD REPORT BEING IN AN ISSOCIATIVE STATE AND HIS DESCRIPTION WAS IT'S LIKE BEING THE PILOT OF AN AIRPLANE AND THEND I FELT MYSELF WALKING OUT OF THE COCKPIT ND THE PLAIN WAS STILL FLYING AND AS IAS TERRIFYING INS A TIN OOBE IN MY AT ATI M ANSARIGHT BUT THE THE POINT IS IN A WAY THE PRINCIPL INDREW IS LIKE THE PRINCIPLE YOU SAID YUN E TO RECONFRONT A TRAMATIC SITUATION BEFORE YOU CAN MODULATE YOUR ASSOCIATIONS TO IT SO YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT IT AXCEPT THE AROUSAL PUT SOME BOUNDARIES AROUND IT AND THEN FIGURE OUT HOW YOU CAN APPROACH THAT PROBLEM OR HOW YOU DID APPROACH THAT PROBLEM FROM A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW SO IT DOES NOT SURPRISE I INFACT WE'VE STUDIED A PEOPLE WHO DISSOCIATED DURING TELONE OF CREATE A EARTHQUAKE AND THE OKLENBERKLY FIRE STORM REMEMBER BOTH THO EL YEERTHQUAKES FOLLOW ME THEN I MOVE S OUT ANAN H NORTHWARD  I'M GOING TO CUTES TOTH EVERYONE IER TIS I'M STARDY TO DISSOCIATE IN SO A DESSOCIATION DOES COMPARTMENTALIZED EXPERIENCE BUT THAT MEANS FROM THE POINT OF VIEWU OF TREATING TRAMA IT IT'S AN IT'S AN INHIBITION YOU DON'T ENGAGEMENT IT'S LIKE IT HAPPENED OVER THERE AND I THINK WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT PEOPL I I SOMETIMES TOO GOOD AT BEING ABLE TO SEPARATE THEMSELVES FROM THE RECOLLECTION SO IT'S IN THERE SOMEWHERE IT DOESN'T IT'S OUT OF SIGHT BUT IS NOT OUT OF MIND IT'S HAVING EFFECTS ON YOU BUT YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH IT YOU CAN'T REPROCESSS SO I DO THINK ONE REASON CEDEME MY WORK A IT IS A THAT IN FACT IT ALLOWS YOU TO KEEP TO RE A APPROACH THE DISSOCIATIVE EXPERIENCE IN A WAY THAT YOU CAN THEN START TO THINK ABOUT AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND JUST THE FACT YOU CAN TURN IT ON AND OFF AND THAT'S ALSO WHERE HIT SELF HYPNOSISIS SO ELF IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT JUST COMES OVER YOU AND HAPPENS TO IT SOMETHING YOU CAN MAKE HAPPEN YOU CAN CONTROL IT YOU CAN DO SOMETHING WITH IT SO YOU FEEL LESS HELPLESS AND OUT OT CONTROL THE ESSENCE OF TRAM IS HELPLESSNESS IT'S NOT FEAR IT'S NOT PAIN IT'S HELPLESSNESS YOU BECOME AN OBJECT YOU BECOME JUST YOUR BODY YOU DON'T CONTROL WHIT'S GOING ON A WERE NOT USED TO THAT YOU KNOW YOU AND I'VE DISCUSSD THIS AT THIS IND THE THIS BRIGAN PAPER ON ANTICIPATION OF BREATHING AND IT'S NOT WHETHER YOU BREATHE INHALE OR EXHALE OR HOLD YOUR BREATH IT'S THAT IF YOU THINK YOU CAN INHALE AND YOU CAN'T A THAT IT'S REALLY UPSETTING UNDERSTANDABLY AND SO IT'S THE THE ISSUE IS CONTROL AND HYPNOSIS WHICH HAS THIS TERRIBLE REPUTATION OF TAKING AWAY CONTROL IS ACTUALLY A SUPERB WAY OF ENHANCING YOUR CONTROL OVER MIND AND BODY ALOVE THAT AND IT IT REMINDS ME THAT NAMING IS SO IMPORTANT YOU ALMOST WONDER IF A SELF HYPNOCESS AND CLINICAL HADNOCESS HAD BEEN CALLED SOMETHING ELSE THAT IT WOULD HAVE A SEPARATED OUT FROM STATE HIPNCISS IN A WAY THAT WOULD MAKE IT A LESS A MEAN A LESS SCARY WEIRD A COMPLICATED FOR PEOPLE TO EMBRACE A BUT YOO THE PARTHERIES OFER HAVING THIS DISCUSSION AS I AVE ULD I'VE HAD GREAT EXPERIENCES WITH HYPNOSIS I'VE SEEN THE DATA OF THE OTIMETALOTIC LINICAL EXAMPLES IT'S INCREDIBLY POWERFUL AND IT WELLS RIGHT DOWN TO NORL BRAIN STATES AM AND YO I THINK IN THE EARS TOCOME ITS GOING TO BECOME A MORE WIDE SPREAD ALONG THOSE LINES HOW QUICKLY YOU'VE DESCRIBE SOME A EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE GETTING RELIEF VERY QUICKLY HOW PERMANENT ARE THOSE CHANGES OM IS THERE A NEED FOR FOLLOW UP AND RELATED TO THAT I'M SURE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO THIS IN INKING WONDERFUL ID LOVE TO GET HYPNOSIZE FOR ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS BY DOCTOR SPEAGLE AR SOMEBODY ELSE EXPERT AND CLENICL HYPNOSIS BUT THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE ACCESS TO YOU OR SOMEBODY ON WITH SIMILAR TRAINING SO WHAT IS THE POWER SO HOW HOW QUICKLY DOES IT WORK HOW LONG LASTING ARE THOSE CHANGES AND THEN IS IT NECESSARY TO WORK WITH A CLENICAL HYPNOTISTS AND IS IT BETTER TO DO THAT THAN SELF HYPNOSIS AND SO ONE IND SO FORTH MAYBE GOU JUST GIVE US A A CONSOR OF THE OF THE LANDSCAPE OF DIRECTED AND AND SELF DIRECTED TREATMENT WELL TYPICALLY UM MOST PEOPLE START BY COMING TO SEE A CLANICION LIKE ME ITS BETTER TO SEE SOME ONE WHOSE LIFE HAS LICENSING AND TRAINING IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL DISCIPLINE MEDICINE LIKE COLOGY INTISTRY WHATEVER AS THERE A LOT OF YIPNESS IS OUTHER WHO A RI US HYPNOTS IS HYPNOTIS  OKAND AND THE KEY ISSUE IS SOMEBODY WHO CAN REALLY ASSUSS WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS AND MAKE SURE THAT YOURE NOT TALKING SOME ONE INTO REDUCING THEIR CHESTPAIN RATHER THAN GETTING THEIR CORINARY ARTERY PROBLEM CAUSE THEY COULD HAVE A REAL ISSUE THE  COD RAT HYPNOSIS MIGHT A JUST BUT WOULDN'T DEAL ITH THE DEEPER UNDERLYING ESITHAT'S RIGHT ON THE OTHER HAND AND TYPICALLY WHEN I USE IT WITH PEOPLE I OFTEN ONLY SEE THEM ONCE OR TWICE OR PERIODICALLY BUT NOT EVERY WEEK AND CURTAILY NOT EVERY DAY IF THEY HAVE A PAIN PROBLEM D HIPNOSIS IS VERY HELPFUL FOR PAIN UM AND AND SO WHEN I'M DOING IS A DENTIFYING HOW HYPNOTIZABLE THEY ARE I GIVE THEM A STANDARD BRIEF TEST OF THEIR ABILITY TO EXPERIENCE EPNOSIS AND THEN GOING THROUGH AS SELF HYPNOS AS EXERCISE WITH THEM TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS SEEING HOW THEY RESPOND TO IT AND THEN TEACHING THEM HOW TO DO IT FOR THEMSELVES AND IN THE OLD DAYS I USED TO HAVE THEM USE THEIR IPHONE AND AND RECORD YOU KNOW A THE THAT PART OF THE SESTIONS SO THEY COULD PLAY BACK THE HYPNOSIS EXPERIENCE NOW WE DEVELOPED AN AT A REVERI THAT THAT A CAN TEACH PEOPLE AND STEP THEM THROUGH DEALING WITH PAIN STRESS A FOCUSS A IN INSOMNIA AND HELP PEOPLE EAT BETTER AND AND STOP SMOKING UM AND BOT WE HAVE A ELEMENTS THAT TAKE ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AND ELEMENTS SUC JUST TAKE ONE AR TWO MINUTES THAT PEOPLE CAN REFRESH AND REENFORCE SO YONI HYPNOSIS YEAS ONE YIS AND IT TO IT'S WONDED TO WER ONE TOR TWO MINUTES NOW AND REFINDING THAT TWO THIRDS OF PEOPLE FIND IT EVEN JUST THE ONE MINUTE REFRESH HER I HELPS THEM FEEL BETTER THEYRE REPORTING THEY FEEL BETTER SO THE NICE THING IS YOU NO RIGHT AWAY WITHER ITS LIKELY TO HELP YOU OR NOT AND WE FOUND WE'VE DONE STUDIES LOOKING AT HYPNOSIS FOR PAINFULLYF IN ACUTE MEDICAL PROCEDURES WE DID A RANDOMIZED TRIAL THAT WE PUBLISHED AN ALLIANCIT THREE CONDITIONS PEOPLE GETTING ARTERIAL CUT DOWNS TO A CHEMO EMBOLIZED TUMORS IN THE LIVOR OR VISUALIZERENG AL ARGERIES TO NOSIS YOU DON'T USE GENERAL IN A SEIZURE FOR THIS ITS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND PEOPLE ARE ANXIOUS AND WE HAD THREE CONDITIONS ONE WAS STANDARD CARE THEY COULD PUSH A BUTTON AND GET OBIOIDS I IVE IS DURING THE SURGER DURING THE SURGERY THE SECOND IS THEY COULD DO THAT PLESE THEY HAD A FRIENDLY NURSE COMFORTING THEM SO WE CONTROLLED FOR PLEASANT ATTENTION AND SUPPORT AND THE THIRD WHICH WE THOUGHT THEMSELF INOSIS FOR PAIN CONTROL SO YER YOUR FEELING YOU CAN CHANGE THE TEMPERATURE YOUR YOUR BODY IS COOL TINGLING AN NON YOUR FLOATING AND I WATER AND FEELING COMFORTABLE A OR GO SOMEWHERE ELSE LEAVE YOUR BODY YERE AND GO TO A DESERT ISLAND AND ENJOY YOURSELF  AND WE FOUND THAT IT'S ABOUT TWO AND HALF HOUR PROCEDUR THAT IF BY THE BY AN HOUR AND A HALF THE HIPNOSEST GROUP HAD REDUCE THEIR PAIN BY EIGHTY PERSENT A COMPARED TO THE STANDARD CAREGROUP USING HALF THE AMOUNT OF OPIITES THEY HAD FEW ER COMPLICATIONS AND THE PROCEDURE TOOK SEVENTEEN MINUTES LESS TIME ON AVERAGE YET DONE BECAUSE NOT ONLY WAS THE PATIENT WERE RELAC SO WAS THE TREATMENTS TAP THEY COULD THEY WERE DEALING WITH SOMEONE WHO STRUGGLING AND UNCOMFORTABLE WE MEASURED THEIR ANXIETY AND SAME THING THEYVNO SUSTER I WAS WORRY THEY WERE ALL DEAD THEY HAD NO ANXIETY AFTER AN HOUR AND A HALF THEY WERE SAYING ON FINE YOU KNOW AND THEY WERE FINE AND AND THE STANDARD CAREGROUP HAD FIVE OUT OF TEN ANXIETY SCORES AT THAT POINT SO WE PUBLISH THAT IN THE LIANCE AT BIG RANDOMIZE TRIAL A IF WE HAD A DRUG THEY DID THAT EVERY HOSPITAL IN THE COUNTRY WOULD BE USING IT NOW YOU KNOW BUT THERE'S NO INDUSTRY TO PUSH IT SO THAT'S PART OF WHAT HELPED US DECIDE THAT WE NEEDED TO HELP PEOPLE IU NON'T DO THIS WITH WITH REVERY AND TEACH THEM HOW TO DO IT AND PROVIDE INTER ACT OF SUPPORT FOR THEM TO DO IT AND DOES IT YOU KNOW THE QUESTION ATHOUGH IS DOES IT WORK LONG TURM CAUSE WHAT WE CAN DO ACUTELY DOESN'T NECESSARILY CARRY ON SO WE DID ARANDOMIZED TRIAL OF WOMEN WITH MEDESTHETIC BREASTCANSER THEY HAD ADVANCING DISEASE WE MET WITH THEM IN A SUPPORTGROUP ONCE A WEEK AND TAUGHT THEMSELF IPNOSIS FOR FIR STRESS AND ANXIETY AND PAIN CONTROL IT THAND AND BY THE END OF A YEAR A THE TREATMENT GROUP HAD HALF THE PAIN THET CONTROL GROUP DID ON THE SAME AND VERY LOW AMOUNTS OF EDICATION SO IT LAST AND THEY WOULD SAY WHEN I FELT THAT PAIN AN MY CHEST AND THOUGHT IT WAS AN MATASTISIS A JUSTED THE EXERCISE I GOT MYSELF IN A WARM BATH THAT I FELT FINE SO A IT IT WORKS BECAUSE IT BECOMES A SKILL THAT PEOPLE ACQUIRE BUT THEY CAN TELL RIGHT AWAY WHETHER IT'S LIKELY TO HELP THEM WORKING WITH A CLINITION OR AN OUT USING THE AFPER I OTHER WAYS OF HELPING THEM LEARN TO USE IT AS A SKILL SO THE NICE THING IS YOU WILL KNOW VERY QUICKLY WHETHER IT'S LIKELY TO HELP YOU OR NOT AND IF IT IS YOU CAN LEARN TO DO IT FOR YOURSELF THAT'S GREAT AND WE WILL A AGAIN THEY'LL BE LING TO REVERY IN THE CAPTION AT A VAILABLE APLEAN ANDREW AND I THINK A EVENTHOUGH THERE'S A NOMINAL COST THERE I THINK THAT A YOU KNOW THE AS YOU MENTION MEDICATIONS AND OTHER APPROACH AS TO DEALING WITH THESE PROBLEMS ARE QUITE EXPENSIVE AND AND POTENTIAL HAVE ALL THE POTENTIAL FOR SAD AFFECTION THINGS NOT THAT SOME OF THOSE AREN'T ALSO USEFUL COULD I BEFORE YOU GET TO THAT JUST ONE THING WE WE'VE WORK VERY HARD ON THE APT WE HAVE AN EYEOIS APT FOR APPLE WE DECIDED TO TO TABLE FOR A MOMENT REDOING THE ENDROY AT SO IT'S NOT IT WAS AVAILABLE A A WHEN WE WERE WORKING THROUGH THE ELECTSIVE PLATFORM IT'S NOT AT THE MOMENT BUT IT WILL BE SOON SO I JUSTDON'T WANT PEOPLE TO BE DISAPPOINTED IF THEY'RE LOOKING FOR IT FOR ANDROIT IT'S IT'S ON OUR AGENDA BUT WE DON'T HAVE IT AT THE MOMENT THANKS FOR THAT CLARIFICATION URROWFULLY IN TIME FOR BOTH UM I GET ASKD A LOT ABOUT AM OBSESSIVE THOUGHTS ARE INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS A ELSE TO GET ASK A LOT ABOUT LUSITI UM IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT HYPNOSIS OURSELF AT NOSIS CAN BE IS FOR DEALING WITH OBSESSIVE THOUGHTS A SOMETIMES THERE IS SOME VERY OBSESSIONAL PEOPLE WHO JUST TURN OUT NOT TO BE THAT HYNOTINESABLE FOR Y AND IT'S NOT RANDOM THEY YOU KNOW THEY TEND TO BE SO OVER CONTROLLING A FLOGHT THEY'RE ALL BUSY VALUATING RATHER THAN EXPERIENCING SO I KNO MY PEOPLE ISONDS LIKE  IT'S SOMETHING AN ADAPTIVE A MINDS THET FOR A LOT OF PROFESSIONS THEN ER IS AND THAT WE GET TRAINED UP IN THAT YEDURING SCHOOL YOU KNOW HOW TO OSESS OVER THE ZAM OBSESS OVER THE YOUARE SOCSIAL INTERACTIONS AM IT'S PART OF BECOMING A FUNCTIONAL HUMAN BEING AND YET IU CAN TAKE US DOWN DIFFERNT WE SOMETIMES OER DO IT I MAY NO'L TELL YOU ON EXAMPLE FROM EXTREME SITUATIONS A COULD  THAT YU KNOW YOU JUDGING A VALUATING YOU'RE NOT LETTING YOURSELF EXPERIENCE INCLUDING EMOTIONALLY I KNOW SOMEBODY A WHO LISTENS TO THE TAPES FROM AIRPLAINS TO THEY GO DOWN SO THEY GET THE BLACK BOX WAN THEY LISTEN TO IT AND HE SAID TO ME YOU KNOW LET'S THIS PROFESSIONER HE DOES THIS RECORY KNOWIT TO NOW AS PROFESSIONSS WHAT HE DID AND CAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO DO ACTION IN PREVENTION ND HOW TO HANDLE THINGS AND HE SAID THAT UM YOU WORRY ABOUT PEOPLE PANICING RIGHT YOU KNOW AND HERE THESE GUIDES KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THEY'VE GOT THIRTY SECONDS OR SOME FORTY FIVE SECOND AND THEY'RE JUST GOING THROUGH THEIR CHECUOLIST HE SAID THE'RE THEY DON'T PANIC ENOUGH THEYRE THEY'RE TAUGHT THAT THIS IS WHAT YOU DO AND AND THERE IS REASON THERE'S GOOD REASON FOR IT BUT SOMETIMES THEY OVERDO IT AND AYOU KNOW ITS IT'S PAINFUL TO LISTEN TO THIS CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SO IT'S KIND OF A BALANCE WE HAVE TO HIT AND SOMETHING U KNOW WE SOMETIMES WE GET TO EMOTIONAL AND TOO ABSORBED AND YOU DON'T YOU'RE NOT WITHED ENOUGH TO SET OF SEE OTHER POSSIBILITIES THAT CAN BE A PROBLEM BUT ON THE OTHER HANDS SOMETIMES YOU'RE TOO RIGID AND CONTROLD AND YOU DON'T LET YOUR EMOTIONS GUIDE YOU TO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO PROTECT YOURSELF FOR PROTECT OTHERS SO UM I WOULD SAY IN GENERAL THAT PEOPLE WITH OUS SED ARE IN THE LESS ON THE LESS HYPNOTIZABLE SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO ALLOW THEMSELVES TO ENGAGE IN ANY AND YOU KNOW THE TYPICAL EXAMPLE IS TO CHECKING WITH OUS SEDY FOR EXAMPLE THEY DON'T REMEMBER YOU KNOW WHETHER THEY YOU'L LOCK THE DOOR OR TURNED OFF TO GUESS AN THE OF AND THEY KEEP GOING BACK AN THEY KEEPIC SO THERE THE VALUET OF COMPONENT OF THE BRAIN KIND OF OVERRIDES THE EXPERIENTIAL ONE AND IM SOMETIMES PEOPLE CAN GET SOME BEN OFIT BUT BUT THEY'RE NOT A GROUP THAT I WOULD SELECT FOR BEING THE MOST LIKELY TO RESPOND TOSELF HYPNOTIC APPROACHES AR PU ARE SUPERSTITIEN SIMILAR SUPERSTITIONS I THER I THINK THAT'S MORE THERE ARE PEOPLE IM WHO ARE VERY HYPTISABLE WHO KEEP GETTING CAUGHT UP IN THINGS LIKE SUPERSTITIONS AND THERE THE IMAGINATION SUPPLIANCE THE REALITY AND A WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF THAT HAPPENING RECENTLY AND SO I I THINK THERE AM IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEY COULD BE HELP BY LEARNING TO SOIT OF SEE IT BUT PUT IT IN CONTEXT YOU KMUST SEE IT FROM A FROM A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW I DEVELOPED A PRETTY VICIOUS SUPERSTITION WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE AND IT WAS HARD TO BREAK ACTUALLY UM I WAS FEEL OF WHEN I TALK TO CLANITIONS I HAVE TO REVEAL CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT WN MYTHOLOGY AND SO IDONL GET MY BILL LATOR THANK YOU A PARTHERIES I RA I'M JUST ETTING BE I DID I I HAD A HABIT OF KNOCKING ON WOOD FOR THINGS AN I NOTICE IS STARTED TO I WOULD I WOULD UM I WOULD SNEAK KNOCKING ON WOOD EVERY ONE SON WHILE ECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE TO THING I WAS DOING TOO OFTEN TI STAR TO REALIZE THAT I IT WAS BECOMING A LITTLE BIT OF A REFLEX AND THEN I SAW THIS INCREDIBLE VIDIO UM FROM BEN SI LEVSKY'S LAB THAT HARVARD HE STUDIES MOTOR PATTERNS HE HAS THESE RATS THAT PRESS DIFFERENT SEQUENCES OF LE OF LEVERS AND TURNED ILS IN ORDER TO GET A PELET OF FOOD BUT THAT AS THEY DO THAT THEY'LL START TO INTRODUCE THESE BEHAVIORS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ACTUAL LEVER PRESSING LIKE THEYSL START SCRATCHING THEIR END THE'RE HIND QUARTERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEIR HAD AND OF THEIR HEADS KEEZES ME THON WERE HATS AND FLIPPING THEIR EARS AND THIS IS IS LIKE A PICTUR BEFORE THRAWING A A BASEBALL THAT OH YOU DO THIS WE WE START TO INCORPORATE MOTOR BEHAVIORS THAT ARE UNRELATED TO THE OUTCOME BUT WE ARE MINE SOMEHOW STARTS TO THINK THAT THEY'RE NECESSARY FOR THE OUTCOME AND SO THEN EVEN O MTIT SO I DECIDE TO BREAK IT BY SIMPLY FORCING MYSELF TID NOT DO IT FORE NOT A WEEK AND THEN I SEEM LIKE A RIDICULOUS THING TO DO NEW WELL NOT GONEWOOD WE COD RESPONSE PREVENTION AND EVERKS CAUSE YOU SAID WHAT WHAT YOU DO IS YOU SET UP A NEW CONTEXT IN YOUR BRAIN WHERE YOU GET THE OUTCOME YOU WANT DEVOID OF THE THE EXCHANEOUS BEHAVIOUR NOW AND I KNEW IT WAS' IT WAS NUTS RIGHT I KNEW AS ILOGICAL RIGHT BUT SOMEHOW THE THESE THINGS TAKE ON MEANING RIGHT UM SO WE TALKED ABOUT STRESS REDUCT THE THE UTILITY OF HYPNOSIS A FOR STRESSS REDUCTION FOBIAS PAIN AM POSSIBLY WE DON'T KNOW BUT FOR A THINGS LIKE EIGTY  T AND O SD IT JUST WILL DEPEND ON HYPNOTIZEABILITY RIT UM YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS A BEAUTIFUL STUDY ON THE UM A MESS A A PRESCANCER AM OUTCOME ER PATIENCE HYPNOTIZEABILITY IS CLEARLY A KE Y VARIABLE YE SO COULD YOU PLEASE TELL US OF WHAT HYPNOTIZABILITY IS HOW IT'S VALUATED AND WHAT THE SPEAGLE IRAL TEST IT SO GI SURE SO A HYPNOTIZABILITY IS JUST A A CAPACITY TO HAVE HYPNOTIC EXPERIENCES AND WE HAVE A TEST CALL THE HYPNOTIC CONDUCTION PROFILE WE RE GIVE A HIGHLY STRUCTURE HYPNOTIC EXPERIENCE AND YOU KNOW THE THE OLD TRADITION AND CLINICALE IV KNOISE IS WAS THAT YOU TRY ABMUCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS TALKING WALKING UPSTAIRS AND DOWNSTAIRS AND OTHER IMAGIS AND TIME WHAT YOU SAY TO THE BREATHING OF THIS SUBJECT IN ALL THAT AND THE MORE YOU CHANGE WHAT YOU DO AS A CLINITION THE LESS YOU CAN MAKE A VARIATION AND OUTCOME SO AN IT CAN TAKE A LONG TIME YOU KNOW OF TWENTY MINUTES THIRTY MINUTES AND I JUST VIEW THAT AS A KIND OF COMPLEX NOT VERY EFFECTIVE WAY OF ASSESSING THE PERSONS HYPNOTAC CAPACITY WE KNOW THAT THE PIQUE PERIOD OF OF HYPNOTIZABILITY IN THE HUMAN LIFE IS THE LADEN SY YEARS IN CHILDHOOD SO EVERY AIGHT YOUR OLD IS IN A TRANCE ALL THE TIME YOU KNW YOU CALL THEM IN FOR DINNER THEY DON'T HEAR YOU THEYR DO IN THEIR THING ND THAT'S WHY CHILDHOOD IS SUCH A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE WORK IN PLAY OR ALL THE SAME THING YOU KNOW AND WE TRY TO MAKE THEM INTO LITTLE ADULGE WHICH I THINK AS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE THEY IN EVERYTHING IS FUN FOR THAT EY ENJOY LEARNING THEY ENJOY EVERYTHING SO WHAT AGE AR  I THE EDIS IS LIKES TO SIX TO TEN SIX TO ELEVEN THEND THEIR PLAYFUL THEY ENJOY EVERYTHING EVERYTHING IS SOT OF A GAME AND FUN AND WE TRY TO MAKE IT MISERABLE FOR THEM BUT THEY THEY'VE GOT IT AND THEN WHEN WHAT PIAGE CALLED A A YOU KNOW A MORE ADULT COGNETIV FRAME WORK WHERE WE LEARN ABSTRACT CONCEPTS WE LEARNED THAT EVEN IF ONE BOTTLE LOOKS BIGGER THAN THE OTHER THAT CAN HAVE EQUAL VOLUME AND SO WE START IMPOSING LOGIC WE'RE GROWING OUR DEAL PF SEE AT THAT POINT AND IMPOSING COGNET OF STRUCTURE ON EXPERIENCE A SOME PEOPLE STRACK TO LOSE THAT HYPNOTIC ABILITY BY THE TIME YOU'RE IN YOUR EARLY TWENTES A A YOUR HYPNOTIZABILITY BECOMES EXTREMELY FIXED AND THERE WAS A STUDY DONE IT AT STANDFORD TOR EARNEST TILL GAR  FILLS ONBARDO TO THIS LOOKING AT A A THEY THETRACT DOWN STUDENTS WHO WERE INCIKE ONE HAD THEIR HYPNOTIZABILITY MEASURED AND RETESTED THEM BLINDLY TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER AND THE TEST RETEST CORRELATION WAS YOU WENTA GUESTS HENT OF US OF OF GUESSING IT ON A POINT SIX SOMETHING YET VERY CLOSE IT WAS POINT SEVEN I TOU WOULD BE POINT SIX ON A TWENTY FIVE YEAR NRAL SO IT'S MORE STABLE THAN I CU OVER TWENTY FIVE YOUR INTERVALS SO ONCE YOU'RE AT THAT POINT THAT'S WHERE YOU ARE WHAT AR THE FACTORS THAT THAT LEAD TO THAT WELL AND AND SO WHAT IT MEANS AS AT ABOUT A THIRD OF IDULGE OR JUS NOT HYPPOTIZABLE TWO THIRDS ARE ABOUT FIFTEEN PER CENT OR EXTREMELY HYPPOTIZABLE AND WE CAN MEASURE THAT AND GIVE IT A NUMBER FROM SURO TO TENT AND THAT'S VERY USEFUL FOR SOME OF MY PATIENTS WHEN I DO IT I SAY LOOK I'M SORRY YOUR N ADVOTISE BOGAN TO DO SOMETHING ELSE NO MEDICATION SYSTEMATIC DESENSITIZATION MINDFULNESS OTHER THINGS A OR IF THER VERY HYPNOTIZABLE I JUST GO FOR IT YOU KNOW I DON'T DO A LOT OF EXPLAINING PEOPLE WHO ARE LOW TO MODERATE HYPNOTIZABLE LIKE EXPLANATIONS ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUT THEN THEY CAN STILL GET THE BENEFITS SO IT HELPS ME GI MY THE NATURE OF MY TREATMEN UP WITH THESE PEOPLE NOW THE THE IROL IS MY FATHER A USED TO USE AN I FEXATION INDUCTION HE USED TO SAY LOOK UP AT THE SCEALING AND AND NOW CLOSE YOUR EYES WHILE YOU LOOKING UP OT YOUR VERY JUST YOUR HERII YES HE NOTICED HE HAD TOO PATIENTS BACK TO BAG AND ONE WAS A WOMAN WHO I'D SEEN HIM WORK WITH WHO HAD HYSTERICAL SEIZURE SHE WOULD JUST SUDDENLY START SHAKING AND IF WE REAL SULEPTEXSEZURS NOW SUITO EPELEPT EXI SAE SO HYSTRIA HYSTERIA AND ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE HAVE BOTH THAT IS THE FOR SOME PEOPLE REAL EPILEPSY BECOMES A FRAME WORK THAT GETS ELABORATED ON FOR WHEN YOUR STRESS YOU HAVE SEIZURE SHE JUST HAD SUITO EPILEPSY NO AE YE AVNORMALITY SANCE SHE WAS REALLY SOMETHING TO WATCH HER HUSBAND HAD TO MOVE HIS WORK BENCH NEAR THE DOOR SO THAT IF SHE START TO HAVE A SEETURE HE COULD RUN HOME AND AND TRY AND HELP HER WITHIT IT WAS THAT BAD AND HE NOTICED THAT WHEN SHE WHEN SHE HSHE DID WHAT YOU DID WHEN SHE LOOKED UP WHEN SHE WOULD HAVE ONE OF HER SEIZURE EVENTS ALL YOU SEE I SCLARA YOU DON'T SEE I RAS ANY MORE AND SHE WOULD START TO SEE SO HE HE DID A GREAT THING WITH HER HE TAUGHT HER TO HAVE SEIZRES EVERYBODY ELSE WAS TELLING HER TO STOP HE MADE HER HAVE ONE SO HE HYPNOTIZ HER LET'S GO BACK TO THE LAST TIME YOU HAD ONE AN SURE ENOUGH SHE START TO SHAKE AND GRADUALLY HE MAKE THEM SMALLER AND SMALLER SO SHE WAS LEARNING SHE COULD CONTROL SHE'D HAVE ACCESS IT'S LIKE WITH PEETIES TE ND OR YOU CONFRONT YOU DON'T AVOID IT YOU DON'T SUPPRESS IT YOU CONFRONTED AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH IT A THE NEXT PATIENT HE HAD WAS A RIGID OBSESSIONAL BUSINESS MAN WHO WANTED TO STOP OU O BEING SO CONTROLLING AND AND AND ALL THIS EF EREMIND ME THERE WAS A NEW YORK OR CARTOUNE OF TE DRIVER WHO COMES TO A YIELD SIGN AND HE YELLS NEVER YOU KNOW ITS ALWAYS BEE TIMES LAHERE NEW YOR OM INNE YOR  A AND SO THIS GUY WHEN HE TRIED TO LOOK UP HE COULDN'T KEEP HIS EYES UP WHILE HE CLOSED TIM AND SO MY A FATHER STARTED TESTING PEOPLE AND IT SEEMED THAT THERE IS A ROUGH CORRELATION BETWEEN THE CAPACITY TO KEEP YOUR EYES UP WHILE YOU CLOSE THEM AND MEASURED HYPNOTIZABILITY SO THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE LISTENING WHAT A MGHT AND AND WATCHING ON DIDIOSO THIS BEGLIROL TAS INVOLVES LOOKING UP AT THE SEALENE OF TILTING THAT HAD BACK OF SELTING MY CHIN BACK AND LOOKING UP THE SEALING OUT EN I MALSO DIRECKING MY EYES UPWARD AN MY EYES ARE OPEN AND THEN THE THE IRAL TESSIBALS THEN CLOSING THE EYELIDS WHILE THE EYES HER OWN OWNER O AND WEATHER OR NOT THE EYES ROLL BACK AND AS HE SAID TO THEN YOU SEE GLARE OF THE WIFE SMARGLER OF THE WHITE RAT NINS YOUR VERY HYPNOSIZABLE OR MODERATELY HYPPOTIZABLE RIGHT RAS IF THE EYES MOVE DOWN AND  SIRIS THE COLOURED PART OF THE EYE AS THE EYES CLOSE LESS HYPNOTIZE RIGHT SEN YOU CAN LOOK US UP ON LINE THERE IT JUST BUT SPEEGALE IRAL TAS AND A AND YOU'LL FIND IT AN AND WE ARE ALSO IN THE DEU IN ACTUAL A EXAMPLE OF HYPNOS IS EM ON BEA LATER RIA SO IT'S YOU'RE ASKING THE BRAIN TO DO SOMETHING DIFFICULT TO TO KEEP THE EYES UP WHILE CLOSING THE I LIS AND SO THAT'S CONTRADICTORY SIGNALS FOR THE THIRD FOURTH AND SIX CRANIAL OR NUCLY I THE CONTROL I MOVEMENT YOU SAID THE THIRD FOURTH AND SIX YE CRANALNER OF NUCLYI AND AND SO THERE THERE YOUR SUSPENDING ONE ACTIVITY WHILE ASKING THEM TO DO ANOTHER AND I MOVEMENTS HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH LEVELS OF CONSCIOUSNESS YOU KNOW THE PERY ACUODUCTOL GREY SURROUNDS THESE CRANIAL NERVE NUWCLY EYE AND A WHEN WE OU KNOW WE CLOSE OUR EYES WHEN WE SLEEP WE HAVE RAVIT I MOVEMENT WHEN WE DREAM MOST DRUGS THAT A FET LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS CAN AFFECT EYES AND O MOVEMENTS EITHER THE DILATION OR CONTRACTION OF THE PUPILS DEPENDING ON WHETHER ITS A STIMULANT OR AN OPIOID STIMULANTS MAKE THE PEUPLES E RIGHT YET THIS TE COGAN EMPHETEMINE RIGHT YOU ASATSEN AND OBEOIDS YOU GET CONSTRICTED PUPILS IS A  APPARENT THE INPARENTS LOOKING IN THERE GETS COMING IN THE DOOR LAT AT NIGHT THERES EIKING FOR RIGT SUBSTANCE THER USE TO RIGHT AND SO SO THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE EYES THAT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT I MAN OBVIOUSLY YOU CLOSE RISE WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP YOU HAVE RAPIT EYE MOVEMENT WHEN YOU'RE DREAMING SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING AND THERE IS THERE'S AN OLD ZEND PRACTICE CAL LOOKING AT THE THIRD EYE AND I THINK PART OF THE REASON THAT THIS HAPPENS IS WERE YOUR LOOKING UP IN THE INSIDE THITS LIKE THIS A THIRD EYE BETWEEN THE OTHER TWO AND YOUR FOREHEAD A AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE VISUAL CREATURES YOU KNOW WERE WE'RE PRETTY PATHETIC FROM A PHYSICAL POINT OF VIEW YOU KNOW MANY ANIMALS CAN OUTRUN US YOU KNOW A AND POR OUT SMELL US OR SEE OF EAGLES CAN READ COULD READ NEWS PRINT TAT A HUNDRED YARDS AND WE CAN'T YOU KNOW IT'S SO A THERE ARE MAJOUR DEFENSIVE SENSURY IN PUT IS VISION AND THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW  ANIMALS PREDITOR ANIMALS HAVE EYES IN THE FRONT OF THEIR HEADS SO THAT THEY HAVE VERY GOOD DETAILED DIVISION A VISION OF PREY WERE IS PREY ANIMALS LIKE DEER HAVE EYES ON THE SIDE OF THEIR HEAD SO THEY DON'T SEE THINGS THAT WELL BUT THEY HAVE A MUCH BIGGER RANGE OF OF POTENTIAL TO SEE THREAT AND WE MAINLY USE IN EFECT THAT THINTERESTING THERE BEEN SOCIAL ENTRAPOLOGIST TO SAY WHY TO WE GATHER WHERE WE DO YOU ON ON COAST LINES AND YOU KNOW AT THE EDGE OF A FOREST OR SOMETHING IT'S BECAUSE YOUE GOT PROTECTION IN THE BACK SOMETHING CAN'T ATTACKIN FROM ONE SIDE AND YOU HAVE A BIG VISION OF WHAT MIGHT THREATEN YOU AND WE TEND A LIKE BE ATTRACTIVE TO THOSE KINDS OF A PHYSICAL SITUATIONS YOU SO LOVE TIS US WE LOVE IS THIS AS A VERY CALMIN THEY TAKE US INTO THAT PANORAMIC VISION THAT'S RIGHT AND I DIDN'T NOTICE BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT MOST OF THE SCENIX SPOTS AT ANY LOCATION IN NATIONAL PARKS AND WE'RE WERE PEOPLE NATURALLY AGGREGATED IT WASN'T A WHICH MAKES SENSE OTER THE OUT BUT THAT THOSE AM SIGNS AND LOCATIONS WERE BUILT UP AROUND AT PEOPLE'S TENDENCY AN ANIMAL'S TENDENCIES O REALLY IS WENT YOU AGGREATE THEIR YET THERE'S A INTERESTON BOOK ON THE HISTORY OF THE NATIONAL PARKS THAT THAT SAYS THAT THEY DIDN'T GIVE A A A RESEARCH STUDY TO SUPPORT IT BUT THERE WAS NO MENTAL MAPSIDE YOU SAID THAT IT'S VERY INTERESTING YE PANORAMA AND AND VISUAL BOUNDARIES ARE REALLY INTERESTING I  THINK SAID THAT THE EYES AS WE BOTH KNOW ARE TWO PIECES OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE BRAIN ROUTSIDE THE AN I USED TO SAY THAT TH EYES ARE OUTSIDE THE SKULL AND AND A A ANEUR OTHEMOL JUS SAD AM THEIRE WROTE TO ME AND AM VEHEMENTLY POINTED OUT THAT THEY ARE OUTSIDE THE CRANIAL VAULT SO YOU KNOW S THERE OUTSIDE THE CRANIEL TOL BUT THEY ARE TO PIECES OF BRAIN THEIR OUT THERE AND SO TH YOU MENTION CRANIEL NERVES THREE FOREIGN SEX THIS ISNT ANER ANATOMY COURSE BUT M BUT MAY WE COAN GO A LITTLE DEEPPER THERE SO THERE YOU SAID THERE'S CONTRADICTORY ACTIVITY LOOKING UP AS CONTROLLED BY A A THE ONE SET OF CRANIAL NERVES AND THEN THE CLOSING OF THE EYELIDS IS CLOT IS CONTROL BY ANOTHER CRANIAL NERVE NO IT'S THE SAME ONE I THINK IT'S SIX THAT THAT AM YOU YOU CLO WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES YOU ACTIVEATE AM THE NOW IT'S THE FACIO I GUESS IT'S THE FACIAL NERVE IT'S THE SEVEN SEVENS ER BUT YOU'RE LOOKING UP YOU'RE ACTIVATING THE MUSCLES A THAT FORCE YOUR EYES TO LOOK UP AND THE THE CLOSEING YOUR EYELIDS NORMALLY RELAXES THOSE RELAXES THAT UPPER MOVEMENT BECAUSE YOUR EYES ARE CLOSED AND YOU DON'T NEED TO DO IT SO YOU'RE BREAKING A CO A USUAL CUSTOMARY MATTER THE REVERY THA HEY I CAN EVEN DO IT SEE I LADY  A IT'S THE GRUBING YOUR ROMI AND PATTING YOUR HEAD IT'S IT'S A IDMIT THERE'S A BIT OF A CONFLICT THERE RIGH BUT CLINICALLY IT'S BEEN A GOOD PROBE FOR YOU AND YT HAV YOUR FATHER SO AS IT SPEGAL SENIORS PEGAL LEGAL DEN AR EGAL SENIOR THAT DEVELOP AS TEGYING I US AND AM BUT THE KEY IS SUE IS THIS ANORMALLY WHEN WE CLOSE OUR EYES ALSO WE'RE GOING TO SLEEP YOU KNOW YOU'R YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD ANY MORE HERE YOU'RE MAINTAINING RESTING ALERTNESS SO YOU'S YOUR FOCUSSING BUT YOUR TURNING INWARD THAT'S AN UNUSUAL STATE NORMALLY WE DON'T WE CLOSE OUR EYES PERIODICALLY WE HAVE TO BUT AM WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME IT'S NORMALLY TO GO TO SLEEP AND YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT YOU KNOW DETECTING RISK OR THREAT A SO IT'S IT'S AN INTERESTING STATE BECAUSE YOU'RE TURNING INWARD BASICLY YOU'RE LOOKING UP YOU'RE SHUTTING YOUR EYES AND YOU'RE ALLOWING WHATEVER HAPPENS OUTSIDE YOU TO HAPPEN AND FOCUSSING ON WHAT'S GOING ON INWARD SO IT'S A I THINK IT'S A SIGNAL TO YOUR BRAIN TO TURN INWARD VERY INTERESTING AM AND MEDITATION OF COURSE COULDN BE DONE WITH EYES OPEN BUT ALMOST I ALWAYS HAS DONE WITH EYES CLOSED YES IM THAT'S RIGHT VERY INTERESTING SO YOU CAN VERY QUICKLY DETERMINED WHETHER NOT SOME ONE IS HIGHLY HYPNOTIZABLE A NOT AT ALL HYPNOTIZE WE SED ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF PEOPLE CAN BE HYPNOTIZED RIGHT IM I'VE SEE A THIRD CANNOT AND BUT WITHIN THE TWO THIRDS THAT CAN THERE'S A RANGE AND YOU SUE FIFTEEN PER CENT OF PEOPLE FALL INTO THIS HIGHLY HYPNOTIZABR CATEGORY TI THING TO BE A MEMBER OF IM AND DOES REPEATED USE OF SELF HYPNOSESS OR CLINICAL HYPNOSIS INCREASE OR CHANGE HYPNOTIZABILITY FOR THOSE THAT CAN ACCESSED IN THE FIRST PLACE I WOULD SAY IN GENERAL IT MAY INCREASE A LITTLE BIT BUT NOT A HELL OF A LOT AND IT'S NOT WORTH THE EFFORT TO INCREASE YOUR POTIZABILITY AT THAT POINT IT'S WORTH TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM YOU'RE DEALING WITH SO YOU CAN GET BETTER AND USING IT AT THE LEVEL THAT YOU HAVE THERE WAS A STUDY DONE IN WHICH THEY TRIED TO TRAIN PEOPLE TO BE MORE HYPNOTIZABLE AND NW OBVIOUSLY THERE SUBJECTIVE AND BEHAVIAL COMPONENTS TO THE TEST YOU CAN LEARN TO DO A LITTLE BETTER ON THEM BUT WHAT WE FOUND WAS WHEN WE REANALYZE THIS DATA THAT WE COULD ACCOUNT FOR THREE TIMES THE FINAL SCORE BASED ON THE INITIAL HYPNOTIZABILITY MEASUREMENT RATHER THAN WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAD BEEN TRAINED TO DO BETTER SO YOU CAN APPROVE IT A LITTLE BUT IT'S NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE GOT IT ALONG THE LINES OF EYES AND I MOVEMENTS A LOT OF INTEREST OUT THERE ABOUT E M D AR I MOVEMENT TO SENSES ATION REPROCESSING  I I SHOULD PERO HERSELF WAS O WORKINK NOT SHE WASN'T OUTSTAMFOR DIRECTLY BUT WAS THE LOCAL TO TO STAMFORD A THINKIN A HEL I'LL TIMEI IM SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON E M D ARE WHERE IS IT USEFUL WHERE YOU THINK IT'S LESS USEFUL A ARTHER THINGS THAT E M D R COULD BE COMBINE WITH TO MAKE IT MORE USEFUL AM YOU KNOW WE GET YOU KNONT THE LISTENERS OF THIS PARTCAST COME TO I THINK COME TO THE PODCAST WITH A RANGE OF BACKGROUNDS AND INTERESTS AM TO ME A MAK SENSE A WHY EM D R IT LATERALIZED I MOVEMENTS A MIGHT WORK GIVEN THE NEW OR DATA THAT IT CAN SUPPRESS MAKE TE ACTIVITY IN SOME ANIMALS AND ANIMAL MODELS AND A IN HUMANS AS WELL BUT IT REALLY HASN'T BEEN EXPLORED MUCH NORALLY I'VE HEARD THINGS LIKE IT CORNATES THE TWO SIDES OF THE BRAIN WHICH IT TO ME IS IS JUS A THROW AWAY I DON'T LY THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE THAT CORNANE THAT TWO SIDES OF THE BRAIN IS BETTER THAN NOT CORNATING I WOULDNT BE SPEAKING RIGHT NOW AT THE TWO SIDES OF MY BRAIN WERE WERE WELL CORRELATED ECAUSE LANGUAGE IS LATTERALIZE SO RIGHT A I'VE HEARD THAT IT MINICS RAPID I MOVEMENT STRING SLEEP BUT ACTUALLY IT DOESN'T SO IM RI BUT I HAVE HEARD AM PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THERE POSIVE EXPERIENCES WITH THE M D'AR WHAT RE YOUR THOUGHTS MAN   YAR YE YOU HAD A GOOD COMMENT ON THAN IN WHEN YOUR RECENT POD GUES AND I I'LL TELL YOU YOU KNOW THONE WAY I SOLD OF THINK ABOUT IT I FROM A AMUSED POINT OF VIEW IS THE OLD YOU MENTIONED IT EARLIER THE OLDEST SORT OF IDEA OF A HYPNOTIC INDUCTION WAS A DANGLING WATCH RIGHT KNOW IN O WH UCH A AND A IN FACT THERE WAS ENOUGH CONCERN ABOUT IT THAT WHEN AUTOMOBILES WERE INVENTED THERE WAS A MOVEMENT TO PREVENT INSTOLING WINSHIELD WIPERS BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE AFRAID THAT THEY WOULD BE HYPNOTIZED IF THEY  WATCH THE WINSHELD WIPERS GO BACK AND FORTH ON A CAR NOW TURNS OUT FORTUNATELY THAT YOU TEND NOT TO LOOK AT THE WINSHEL WIFE IS YOULD KEEP LOOKING THROUGH THE WINSHIELD AND SO WE HAVE WINSHELL WIPERS TO DAY BUT THAT MOVEMENT IS WHAT EXACTLY USED TO BE A HYPNOTIC CONDUCTION I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF HIF NOSIS IN IN THE EMDY AR AH AND I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF THAT WITH YOU KNOW EXPOSURE BASE TREATMENTS WERE YOU USIN IM BE ARE TO THINK ABOUT IT YOU TEND NOT TO PROCESS THE EXPERIENCES MUCH AND JUST DO THE PHYSICAL PART OF IT WHICH I PERSONALLY THINK AS A DRAWBACK AND EVERY STUDY I'VE SEEN THAT WAS A DISMANTILLING STUDY IT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT PEOPLE WHO GO THOUGH HIM TO YOUAR MANY OF THEM GET BETTER WITH TRAMA RELATED PROBLEMS AND THE VIE HAS A BIG PROGRAM USING IND SO ON BUT EVERY PROGEN THAT HAS DISMANTLED GOING THROUGH THE TREATMENT WITH HAVING THE LATTER ALE I MOVEMENT A HAS SHOWN THAT IT THE LATTERLE I MOVMENT DOESN'T AND ANYTHING TO IT AND TOWARD THE END OF HER CAREER A FRANCING A WAS DOING OW CONTRALATERAL TOUCHING OR SOMETHING IT WASN'TD Y MOVEMENTS ANY MORE IT WAS OTHER THINGS SO I I TEND TO THINK THAT A EMDY AR IS ANOTHER FORM OF EXPOSEYOURE BASE THERAPE FOR TRAMA BUT AS AS YOU'VE IMPLIED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THIS POSSIBLE NEW DATA ITS CERTAINLY DOESN'T HAVE TO DO WITH RAPID Y MOVEMENT SLEEP AND I DON'T I DON'T THINK MOVING THE EYES IS THE ISSUE I THINK IT A WAY OF SITTING DOWN AT CONFRONTING TRAMA AND I WOULD RATHER THAT THE TROM ITSELF BE PROCESS TO BIT MORE THAN OFTEN HAPPENS IN THE EMDY AR SO A LOT OF PEOPLE AVE GOTTEN THERA BE SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN HELPED FRANCING USED TO ORIGINALLY CLAIM THAT JUST ONE SESSION WOULD DE SENSITIZED PEOPLE IN DO IT AND THAT'S CLEARLY NOT TRUE I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO SAID YET HELP FOR A WHILE BUT I YOU IN TE MORE SO I I I THINK IT IT BECAME A KIND OF A YOU KNOW OVERLY SIMPLICITIC APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING BRAIN PHYSIOLOGY AND THAT PART OF WRONG AND AND YOU KNOW THE INTERESTING THING  KNOW YOU MENTION SUPPRESSING MINGAL ACTIVITY IT'S VERY INTERESTING THAT MIG LATE FRIEND ALEN HOPSON WHOIS A BRILLIANT SLE AVSERC YOU KNOW REAR I WELL I DON'T KNOW HIM BUT I I READ HIS BOOK WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE ABOUT THA HEMISTRY OF SLEEP RI ENDEE A SIMILARITIES BETWEEN DREAM STATES AND HALLUCINATIONS T AND OT'S ONE OFTHE REASONS I GOT INTO THESYES WHILE I WORKE WITH HIM IN A MA CART THOUR MY BODYG AT WORK FOR MANY YEARS I BRILLIANT GI POINTS OUT THAT WE NEED TO GET INTO PRIMARILY APPARENT SYMPATHETIC STATE TO GO TO SLEEP A THAT WE HAVE TO SHUT OFF SHUT OFF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND AND THAT'S WHY ALLOWED NOISE WAKES YOU UP WHEN YOUR HEARTRATE GOES UP AN ALL IS SO HE WAS A BR UBIING IT A DOCUMENTING WHAT HAPPENS IN THE BRAIN SLEEP HE POINTED OUT SOMETHING ALSO VERY INTERESTING ABOUT DREAMS WHICH IS THAT THE STORIES IN DREAMS AND EVEN THE IMAGES IN DREAMS CAN CHANGE ALL OVER THE PLACE IN CRAZY WAYS BUT USUALLY THE AFFECT IS CONSTANT SAID USUALLY IF IT'S A FRUSTRATION DREAM WHATEVER HAPPENS YOU WANT TO FRUSTRATED IF IT'S AY YOU KNOW ENJOYNMENT DREAM YOU ENJOY WHATEVERIS GOING ON SO THERE'S A ODD CONSISTENCY AND AFFECT IN DREAMS THAT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE IN OTHER STATES AND THE IDEA OF OR LATTERAL I MOVEMENT SUPPRESSING A MIDAL ACTIVITY WHAT KIND OF FIT WITH TAT THAT YOU DON'T ALLOW INTRUSIONS OF FEAR AND ANGER AN UPSET IND THERE IT MAY BE THERE ALL THE TIME BUT IT MAY NOT BE THERE WHEN YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE SO WHY IS IT THAT YOU CAN BE FALLING OFF TE BUILDING IND SOMEHOW NOT THAT SCARED YOU KNOW YOUR JUST HAVING TIS EXPERIENCE OF FLYING IN A DREAM SO I I THINK THERE MAY BE SOMETHING GOING ON ABOUT REGULATING AFFECT BUT THEARE WE HAVE A OLABORATE AD BETTER WAYS TO REGULATE AFFECT GREAT SO THE EMDYARE MIGHT INCORPORATE SOME ELEMENTS OF HYPNOSIS BY TO THE LATTER LIES I MOVEMENTS PERHAPS BY WAY OF SUPPRESSING THE IMINGLE OF THE SPHERE ASSOCIATED CENTER MIGHT BRING PEOPLE INTO MORE PARISIMPATHETIC CALM STATE SO MIGHT BE SUTO HYPNOSIS AND THEN AN EXPOSURE THERAPY THROUGH T THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ISSUE RIGHT MOKIN UM MORE RESEARCH NEEDED ON HEEMDY ARE OUT THERE AND AM OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT'S COME UP A LOT IN THIS DISCUSSION AND IN OUR AM DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE THE GREAT FORTUNE OF TALKING YOU EVERY WEEK IS AND WORKING TOGETHER IS THIS IDEA OF GETTING CLOSE TO THE POBIA GETTING CLOSE TO THE TRAMA RE EXPERIENCING IT AS A PORTAL TO THEN ADJUSTING THE RESPONSE TO IT AND REWIRING SOMETHINGS OF THE TROUBLING THING WERE THE HORRIBLE THING IS NO LONGER HART AS HORRIBLE TO US THAT BUT THAT THE THE REPEATING THEME IS WE CAN'T EXPECT TO GET OVER SOMETHING WITHOUT GETTING REALLY CLOSE TO IT MAY BE VEN EXPERIENCING IT SOMATICALLY NOWADAYS WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT INTRIGGERS AND TRIGGER WARNINGS AND UM CERTAINLY ONE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THOSE ARE WHY THOSE EXIST BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THEIRSAY IN THE GENERAL POPULATION THERE'S THIS IDEA THAT WE WANT TO MOVE AWAY FROM ANYTHING THAT UPSETS US AND YET  I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY EVEN THOUGH HAVING GATHERS THE STATISTICS THAT ON THE WHOLE THAT THE A HUMAN BEINGS ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE ANXIOUS AND MORE AND MORE STRESSED PERHAPS A BECAUSE OF BUT CERTAINLY IN PARALLEL WITH THE FACT THAT WERE TRYING TO MOVE AWAY FROM TROUBLING THIS TROUBLING THINGS SO I'VE HEARD YOU SAY BEFORE THAT IT'S IN TERMS OF THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE STATE YOU GET INTO BUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU BROUGHT YOURSELF THER VOLUNTARILIS EXAC WE SO THE THIS ELEMENT OF A DELIBERATE SELF EXPOSURE DECIDING I'M GOING TO CONFRONT THE TRAMA I'M GOING A CONFRONT THE PAIN I'M GOING TO CONFRONT THE INSOMNIA I'M GOING TO CONFRONT THE YOU KNOW AND FILLING THE BLANK AND THEN READJUSTING ONE'S EMOTIONAL RESPONSE RIGHT UP NEXT TO THAT TROUBLING THING THAT SEEMS TO BE THE THE WHOLE MARK OF OF THIS TREATMENT AND COME IF IM THINKING ABOUT IT CORRECTLY OF PRETTYMUCH ALL TREATMENTS FOR GETTING OVER STUFF IF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A REALLY GOOD CLINITION LIKE YOURSELF HOW SHOULD THEY CARRY THESE THOUGHTS IN THESE IDEAS I MAN I THINK ALMOST EVERYBODY OF ANY REASONABLE AGE HAS MEMORIES OR THINGS THAT UPSET THEM BUT  WE LEARN TO SUPPRESS THEM WHAT DOES ONE DO I YOU SEE THE REVERYAP HAS APPROACHES TO DEALING WITH SOME OF THIS AM INSIDE OF THE AP  BUT HOW DOES ONE START TO THINK ABOUT ACTUALLY DEALING WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND AFWAITING THE HAZARDS OF JUST CONT OF REACTIVATING A LOT OF PAINFUL EXPERIENCES BECAUSE A LOT OF BEING A FUNCTIONAL HUMAN BEING IS ALSO GOIN A WORK EACH DAY IN ER ACT WITH PEOPLE AND NOT BRINGING ONE'S TRAMA YOU ON DOMETHING IT OUT ALL ON THE TABLE OR WHAT BEING ABLE TO JUST FUNCTION IS SO CRUCIAL SO HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS AS A CLINITION WELL YOU KNOW THE IMAGE THE COMES TO MINE IS THE GREEK MITH OF PANDOR'S BOX YOU KNOW THAT IT OPEN AND THE FURIES GOT OUT AND YOU COULDN'T PUT HIM BACK IN AND WE HAVE THIS KIND OF FANTASY THAT ONCE YOU GET INTO THESE MEMORIES YIT THEY'LL TAKE YOU OVER AND YOU'LL NEVER GET THEM BACK IN THE BOX AND I THINK THAT'S WRONG AU NOW WE WE PEOPLE WHO USE TOGNOSIS SAY THAT THERE ARE WAYS TO PRESENTHINGS TO PEOPLE THAT WILL BE HELPFUL AND WAYS IT WON'T AND ONE REAL MISTAKE IS TO TELL SOME ONE DON'T THINK ABOUT PURPLE ELEPHANTS YOU KNOW WHAT DOR YOU THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW ALL DOESN'T WORK SO YOU WANT A FIND A WAY TO FEEL IN CONTROL OF THE ACCESS AND TO DEFIND WHAT HAPPEN ON YOUR OWN TERMS AND SO I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF TRIGGER WARNINGS I THINK WEARE GOING CRAZY OVER YOU KNOW THIS COULD BE UPSETTING THAT COULD BE USET AND YET THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS ERUSATYINGYOU KNOW THE AVERAGE KID HAS WATCH TWENTY THOUSAND MURDERS AND BY THE TIME HE'S TWENTY YEARS OLD WATCHING TELIVISON AND MOVIES THESE DAYS SO YOU A WE SEE TERRIBLE THINGS AND AND IT'S NOT A MATTER OF ALE YOU EXPOSED TO SOMETHING THAT'S UPSETTING BUT HOW DO YOU HANDLE IT WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT AND ARE YOU FEELING IN CONTROL IS NOT LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT DI WHAT PUDENT IS DOING TO HIS HIS RIVAL IN RUSSIA YOU KNOW FORCING HIM TO WATCH PROPAGANTO WOBIE'S TEN HOURS A DAY WHILE HE'S IMPRISON IT'S A MATTER OF THINKING AM ABOUT A PROBLEM IN A WAY THAT LEAVES YOU FEELING YOU UNDERSTAND IT BETTER YOU'RE IND MORE CONTROL YOU CAN TURN IT OFF WHEN YOU WHEN YOU WANT YOU CAN TURN IT ON WHEN YOU WANT AND SO WE HAVE TO IN LIFE DEAL WISTRESSFUL THINGS THE'RE IS STUDIES CAREN PARKER AT STANDFORD HAS DONE SOME WONDERFUL A STUDIES WITH PRIMEMATES ABOUT STRESS AND NOCULATION THAT IF YOU SEPARATE A BABE MONKEY FROM HIS MOTHER FOR TWO HOURS A DAY AND THEN REUNITE THEM AND THEN YOU STRESS THAT BABY MONKEY LATER THEY ACTUALLY HANDLESTRESS BETTER IRE'S LESS CORTERSOL AROUSAL IN THE FACE OF DHISTRESS STRESS AN OCULATION HATS BEEN CALLED SO MERE EXPOSURE TO TRAMA IISTRESS IT'S A PART OF LIVING ANYWAY WE CAN'T AVOID IT EVEN IF WE LIKE TO AND UM IT'S NOT PLEASANT IT'S NOT GREAT BUT IT'S SOMETIMES THINGS YOU NEED TO LEARN ABOUT LIFE AND IF YOU CAN FIND AND ALGARITHEM FOR FACING IT PUTTING IN ITTO PERSPECTIVE DEELING WITH IT YOU BECOME A STRONGER PERSON THAT A WEAKER PERSON SO THIS IDEA THAT COLLEGE STUDENTS OR SUCH FRAGILE FLOWERS THAT IF YOU TALK ABOUT A SEXUAL ASSAULT OR SOMETHING YOU OR YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING TERRIBLE TO THEM IT'S JUS WRONG AND AND I THINK WE NEED TO BUILD OUR ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE AN MANAGSTRESS AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT DOING IT YER YOU CAN'T LEARN YOU CAN WRITE A BICYCLE WITHOUT TAKING THA RISK OF FALLEN OFF IT YOU KNOW AND SO I THINK THAT'S THE WAY I THINK OF FEELING WITH DISTRESS I'M REALY APPRECIATE YOU SAYING THAT I A WAS YOU AND I WERE BOTH AT A GATHERING LET SAY WHERE AM THIS ISSUE WAS BEING DISCUSSED AND AROUND AND ISSUE OF A OF A PUBLICIZED SEXUAL TRAMA AND AM YOU MADE AT EXCELLENT CASE FOR WHY IT THE STUFF CAN'T BE PUSHED UNDER THE RUG UM AND THAT ACTUALLY IN MY OBSERVATION LET TO A LOT A HEELING FOR THE PEOPLE THAT AND THE FAMILIES OF PEOPLE HAN SUFFERED FROM THIS IN THE UM I DO THINK A PEOPLE ARE RISILIENT THEY A BUT WE DON'T REALLY TEACH HOW HOW TO THINK ABOUT FEELINGS YOU KNOW WE DON'T YOU WERE TOLD THAT WE NEED TO FEEL OUR FEELINGS BUT THEN AGAIN A WE ARE ALSO TOLD THAT FEELINGS DON'T HOLD ALL THE INFORMATION AND SO I THINK THAT AS YOU MENTION THE'S NO OPERATING OUR USER'S MANUAL FOR THIS NERVOUS SYSTEM THING AM BRINGS ME TO ANOTHER ISSUE WHICH IS THE MYNE BODY CONNECTION SOMETHING THAT WERE VERY INTERESTED IN AND I YOU'VE DONE EXTENSIVE WORK ON YOU WE ALL LIKE TO THINK THAT GETTING MORE IN TOUCH WITH OUR BODY WOULD BE A GREAT THING LEARNING TO INTERACEPT PAYING ATTENTION TO OUR INTERNAL LANDSCAPE WOULD BE A GREAT THING BUT AS WE OFTEN DISCUSS AM WHEN WE'RE FEELING LOUSY THEN BEING REALLY IN TOUCH WITH THAT LOUSY FEELING MAYOR MAY NOT BE A GOOD THING I UM SO HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT MINE BODY IT I CAN SEE EXAMPLES IN HYPNOSIS FROM YOUR DESCRIPTIONS OF HYPNOSIS WHERE A YOU WANT TO UNIFY THE MINE MODY CONNECTION FEEL WHAT YOURE THINKING THIT THINK WHAT YOU'R FEELING ET CETERA BUT I COULD ALSO AM POINT TO ELEMENTS WITHIN THE HYPNOTIC PROCESS IN WHICH YOU ARE ACTIVELY UNTRY TO UNCOUPLE THOSE SO IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THIS HOLD MY BODYTHING IS A BIT MORE LIKE A A CAR YOUCAN'T SAY THAT A FORTY MILES PER HOUR IS THE OPTIMAL SPEED IT KIND DEPENDS ON THE THE ROAD YOUR ON AND THE TURN YOU MAYOR MAY NOT BE TAKING UM HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT MINE BODY IN TERMS OF A YOU NAVIGATING DAILY LIFE WHAT WHAT YOUTHINK IS THE ADAPTIVE WAY TO TO CONCEPTIONALIZE THE MINE BODY IT'S A BIG QUESTION IT IS IT IT'S IT IT'S A VERY INTERESTING ONE IM I I GUESS I THINK UM THAT IT'S A MATTER NOT OF YOU KNOW ABSOLUTE CONTROL BUT MORE CONTROL THAT THAT  WE NEED TO THINK OF OUR BRAIN AS A TOOL AND AND OUR BODYS SIGNALS AS TOOLS AS WELL TO HELP US UNDERSTAND O WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD WHAT WE NEED WHAT MATTERS WHAT'S IMPORTANT WHAT ISN'T A BUT ALSO SOMETHING THAT CAN BE MANAGE NOT SIMPLY YOU KNOW ABSORBED AND SO HIPNOSIS I THINK IS A KIND OF LIMITING CASE WERE YOU CAN PUSH IT ABOUT AS FAR AS WE CAN PUSH IT I IN TERMS OF REGULATING PAIN PAIN IS THAT YOU KNOW IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TO PAY ATTENTION IF YOU JUST BROKE YOUR ANKLE YOU BETTER PAY ATTENTION TO IT AND GET HELP OR YOUR HAVING CRUSHING SUBSTERNAL CHESSPAIN YOU BETTER DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BUT OUR BRAIN IS SORT OF PROGRAM TO TREAT ALL PAIN SIGNALS AS IF THEY WERE NOVEL PAIN SIGNALS IF IT'S A SUDDEN NEW PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ATTENDED TO I TEACH PEOPLE T O TO TO THINK OF THE PAIN AND CATEGORIZE ITS  IIS IT DOES IT DOES THE PAIN MEAN THAT IF YOU PUT WEIGHT ON THIS YOUR EN  REINJURE YOUR ANKLE FOR EXAMPLE OR DOES IT SIMPLY MEAN THAT YOUR BODY IS HEALING IN THE PAIN IS ASSIGN THAT GRADUALLY THINKS ARE GTTING BACK TO NORMAL AND AND SO YOU CAN MODIFY THE WAY YOU PROCESS PAIN BASED ON WHAT YOUR BRAIN TELLS YOU THE N MEANS AND THAT'S TRUE FOR EMOTIONAL PAIN AS WELL AND PARTICULARLY WHERE I THINK A STRATIGY THAT REALLY HELPS IS IF YOU THINK OF A AND INTER PERSONAL PROBLEM OR THREAD OF SOMETHING COMING AM AS AS A AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING TO AMELIRATE THE SITUATION SO IT'S NOT JUST ITS HAPPENING TO YOU BUT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN INFLUENCE AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT SO IT'S BLENDING THE RECEPTIVE WITH THE ACTIVE RESPONSE THAT I THINK CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE SO YOU TRY IN PROCESSIT IN A WAY THAT GISE YOU WOULD DEEPER UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S HAPPENING YOU FASE IT BUT YOU ALSO SAY THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND THE MINUTE YOU REALISTICALLY IN HAND AND THIS DOESN'T MEAN I MAGINE A WAY ART ATTACK IT MEANS FIGURE OUT HOW TO REHABILITATE FROM HARD ATTACK A OR A BROKEN LEG OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN A WAY THAT YOU GET AS MUCH CONTROL INTO THE SITUATION AS YOU CAN ALOIT AM GRIEF GRIEF IS ONE OF THE STATES THAT IS VERY HARD TO I REMOVE ONESELF FROM YOU KNOW IT AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK ME HOW DO I DEAL WITH GRIEF AND I'M NOT A CLINITION SO I'M DEFERRING TO YOU ON THE ONE HANUSHY SOME ONE OUT STAMPORED RECENTLY AM CAME TO ME IN SAID YOU KNOW MY MY MOTHER PASSED AWAY AND IA SIMBLING THE PASSED AWAY AND THEY ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT I HAD AND IMALSO LIVING ALONE AND CHALLENGE WITH A NUMBER OF THINGS AND IM THEY LOOK LIKE THEY WERE HOLDING IT TOGETHER AND IM VERY WELL IN FACT GIVEN WHAT THEY WERE DESCRIBING I AND ON THE ONE HAND I I I WELL I CERTAINLY POINT OUT THAM NOT CLANITION BY SIT ON THE ONE HAND YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT IT WOULD BE NECESSARY AND USEFUL TO GO INTO THE GRIEF STATE IF YOU WANT TO TRANSITION THROUGH IT RI OM ON THE OTHER HAND O THERE I'VE HEARD BEFORE THAT THE CATHARTIC MODEL OF JUST REALLY DIVING INTO AN EMOTION CAN ALSO BE PATENTIALLY HAZARD US IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY ANCHORORS AM TO O GRAB ON TO OF WHAT WHAT IS THE VIEW OF PSYCHATRY OR YOUR VIEW OF GRIEF AND HOW TO DEAL WITH GRIEF BECAUSE I THINK GRIEF IS IS AT ONE OF THOSE ALL ENCOMPASSING EMOTIONS FOR MANY PEOPLE HIM IT IS AND IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT NATURAL NECESSARY STAGE OF LIFE AND THE REASON WE HAVE ALL THESE GREE FRITUALS YOU KNOW FROM VERY OLDS AND MEMORIALS AND HAD STONES AND SITTING CHIVA AND OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE DO IT'S A WAY OF MAKING IT REAL THAT AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE LOSS HAS TO BE COMPREHENDED YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT YOURE NOW WHEN I HAVE TO LIVE LIFE WITHOUT YOUR LOVED ONE YOUR PARENT YOUR CIVILING WHOEVER AM AND WE'VE ALL GO GONE THROUGH THIS AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER I CERTAINLY HAVE AND IT'S VERY HARD TO JUST COME TO TERMS WITH BUT ONE PRINCIPLE IS TO SORT OVE SAY IIT'S NOT IT'S NEVER ALL OR NONE ITS MORE OR LESS SO YES IT'S ALL OR NONE THAT YOU'VE LOST A LOVED ONE BUT I ASKD PEOPLE AS PART OF THEIR GRIEVING TO SAY TO THEMSELVES AND I DO THIS IN HIPNOSIS SOMETIMES TOO A A YOU'VE LOST THEM BUT WHAT HAVE THEY LEFT YOU WITH WHAT I WHAT HAVE THEY BEQUEATHED TO YOU EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE GONE AND I'LL SOMETIMES ASKED THEM TO SAY IF YOUR MOTHER COULD BE HERE RIGHT NOW WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO YOU HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT YOUR LIFE NOW WHAT WOULD HE ADVISE YOU TO DO SO IN OUR SUPPORT GROUPS FOR WOMEN WITH ADVANCED PRESSC ANSWER WE WE LOST PEOPLE AND AND I GOT TO TELL YOU THAT WE WERE WARNED BY ON COLLEGIS THAT WE DEMORALIZED PEOPLE IT I ME THERE ARE WONDERFUL OCHOLOGIST BUT THERE IS SOME THAT WERE VERY AFRAID THAT THAT WE WOULD HARM THEM IN SOME WAY BECAUSE THEY YOU KNOW THE MORTALITY RATE IS FAIRLY HIGH WITH NETUS THAT APRESS ANSWER HEY'VE EEN A WATCH PEOPLE DIE THE SAME DISEASE AND YOU'LL DEMORALIZM AND I SO WE ACTUALLY MEASURED THERE EMOTION AND THE CONTENT OF SPEECH EVERY FIVE MINUTES THROUGHOUT A BUNCH OF GROUPS TO MAKE SURE THAT WASN'T HAPPENING WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT MORE SERIOUS ISSUES BUT THE MOOD DIDN'T ACTUALLY GET WORSE AND WEVE FOUND IN GENERAL THAT EXPRESSING NEGATIVE EMOTION ON THE LONGER AND HELPS PEOPLE BE LESS ANXIOUS AND DEPRESSED OVER TIME AND WE'VE SHOWN THIS AN RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL SO AS NOT JUST MY CLINICAL IMPRESSION AND AND OF WHAT WE WHAT WE TRY TO GET THEM TO DO IS TO FACE THE LOSS LIVE WITH THE EMOTION THAT COMES WITH IT BUT ALSO SEE THAT THE REASON AT HURT SO MUCH IS HOW MUCH THAT PERSON GAVE YOU SO WE WOULD DO ISELF IGNOSIS EXERSISE THAT THE ANTEGRAM SAY I WANT YOU TO GET YOUR BODY FLOATING SAFE AND COMFORTABLE NOW PICTURE MARRY AND AND A SIT WITH THE FEELING OF SADNESS THAT SHE'S NO LONGER WITH US AND WE DO THAT FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN WEE'D SAY ON THE OTHER SIDE PICTURE ONE THINGS SHE LEFT WITH YOU THAT YOU STILL HAVE THAT YOU CARRY ON IN YOUR HEART HER TRADITION OF WHAC HE GAVE TO YOU AND SO JUST SEEING IT NOT AS A COMPLETE LOSS BUT AS A REAL LOSS A PAINFUL LOSS BUT ONE THAT HELPS YOU TO REFLECT ON WHAT YOU GAINED FROM HER AND KNOWING HER A I THINK CAN BE VERY HELPFUL AND THE GRIEVING PROCESS IT'S VERY HELPFUL THAT THE WAY TO CONCEPTIONALIZE IT A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS A CAN CHILDREN BE SAFELY  HYPNOTIZED HER DOOURSELF HAPNOSUS THEY IT SOMETIMES HARDER FOR THEM TO DO SELF HIGNSIS THEY NEED MORE STRUCTURE TO DO AT YOU GOT A SHARE YOUR DORSALLOUT OR PREFRONT OF PORTECS WITH THIM A LITTLE F IT BUT YES ABSOLUTELY CHILDREN CAN BE VERY ADVOTIZABLE AND A I I KNOW PEDIATRICIONS WHO USE IT WONDERFULLY ALL THE TIME THEY GET THEM TO FOCUS ON SOMETHING ELSE SO THERE CAN HAVE TO GIVE THEM A SHOT OR DRAW BLOOD OR SOMETHING AND THEY'LL SAY I'M GOING UP PRESS YOUR HAPPY BUTTON AND PRESSES THEIR BILLY BUTTON AND THEY START TO GIVE E THE WAY KIDS DO AND MEANWHILE THE NURSES DRAWING THE BLOOD AND THEY DON'T EVEN NOTICE IT A DENTIST GOOD DENTIS CAN U SUC TO HELP KIDS WITH FEAR AND PAIN SO YES HAT CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE FOR CHILDREN WE DID A RANDOMIZE TRIAL I HAVE A PPUBLICATION IN PEDIATRICS MY LATE SISTER WHO AS APEDIATRICIAN AAND WHO ALWAYS USED TO JOKE THAT A SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE IN OUR FAMILY WHO AS A REAL DOCTOR YOU A I SAID I GOT SHA I GOT A PAPER IN PEADAND AND THE PAPER WAS CHILDREN HAVING TO UNDERGO AVOIDING SISTER YOU REATHOR GRAM SO THERE THE THE ANATOMY THAT KIDNEY IF YOU'LL FORGIVE ME SUCH INTERESTING IN THAT THE THE URATER THAT GOES INTO THE BLATTER NORMALLY GOES INTO THE BLATTER AT AN ANGLE AND SO THAT MEANS THAT WHEN THE BLATTER CONTRACTS TO EXPEL URANE IT AUTOMATICALLY CLOSES OFF THE URTER BECAUSE IT SIDEWAYS TO THE BLATTER SOME KIDS ARE BORNE WITH THE PERPENDICULAR AND THEN YOU'LL GET REFLECTS INTO THE KIDME AND SOME CHILDREN OUT GROW AT SOME NEE PRETTY CUBLICATED SURGERY TO FIX THAT AND SO YOU YOU IMAGE THEM EVERY YEAR OR SO TO SEE WHETHER THE'RE GETTING KITNIY DAMAGE OR NOT AND IT'S A PRETTY MISERABLE EXPERIENCE YOUR NINE YOAR OLD GIRL YOU HAVE TO GO ON LIE ON A HARD COLD TABLE HAVE STRANGERS PULL YOUR LEGS APART AS TOK A CATHITR INTO YOUR A EURETHRA AND HOLD IN THE BLATTER AND THEN EXPEL YURAN AND SO YOU GET INTO THE STRUGGLING FIGHTS AND OF COURSE THE MORE THEY STRUGGLE THE MERE THEY CONSTRECT AND IT MAKES IT HARDER TO DO IT SO A I WAS ASKED IF WE COULD TESTU SO WE DID A RANDOMIZE TRIAL OF CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL A THEY EITHER GOT TRAINING IN SELF HIPNOSIS I WOULD HAMEET WITH THEM AND THE MOTHER THE WEEK BEFORE WE FIND OUT FROM THE KIDS WHERE THEY LIKE TO BE ANDITS TA EURN TO PLAY A TRICK ON YOUR DOCTORS YOUR BODIES THERE YOUR SOMEWHERE ELSE GOD VISIT YOUR FRIEND GO TO DISNINGLAND DO SOMETHING ELSE AND THE MOTHER WOULD WORK ON THIS WITH ME AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE AND WE FOUND THAT THESE CHILDREN WERE MUCH EASIER TO IMAG ONE GOT SO RELAXED AT SO YOU GINE WE HE'S ENORMALLY IT TAKES US TEN MINUTES TO GET THEM TO PEA AFTER THEIR DOING THIS SHE WAS SO RELAX YE STARTED PEING BEFORE I COULD EVEN GETP THE BED PAN UNDER ER N IT TE CLEAEN UP THE TABLE YOU KNOW AND THEY ALSO SEVENTEEN MINUTES SHORTER PROCEDURES AND THAT'S A LONG SEVENTEEN MINUTES FER VOR A LITTLE KID SO IT CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE WITH CHILDREN OR LESS ANXIOUS THEY HAVE LESS PAIN AND I GET THROUGH THESE DIFFICULT PROCEEDURES VERY WELL THAT'S GREAT HAS HYPNOS AS EVER BEEN DONE IN A FOR COUPLES LIK COUPLES THERAPY I'M THING OF PREMUCH EVERY CLINICAL SETTING HERE BOTH YOU OUGHT TO BE HYPNOTIZABLE OF COURSE BUT YTHE REASON I ASKE ABOUT THIS IS NEXT IME AN TO ASK ABOUT PSYCHODELICS AND THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN CORDINATING STATES THROUGH THE USE OF OF DRUGS OF DIFFERENT KINDS A WE AC HAL DO THIS WHEN WE TREAT DEPRESSION RIGHT YOF A DEPRESS PERSON WITH A FAMILY NEMBERS OR NOT TO PRESSING YOU SAY WELL LET'S MAKE THEM ALL A NOT DEPRESSED RIGT I NOT YUIBUN ALL EN AND I'M ONLY HALF KITTING THERE BECS THAT IS KIND OF THE UNDERLYING LOGIC IN SOME SENSE BUT AM ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY IM OF ANY CORDINATED HYPNOSIS THAT'S INTERESTING III'VE DONE PLENTY OF IT IN GROUPS NOT NOT WITH COUPLE YOU CAN HYPNOTIZE LARGE GROUPS OONTS YE ARE WEHYPNOTIZED RIGHT NOW YET YOU ARE AND I HOPE YOU'VE BEEN ENJOYING IT IM AI BUT THTHE THEMEDISETIC BRESCANST AN IT WAS A GROUP OF LIKE TEN WOMEN WHO WOULD MEE ONCE A WEEK AND WE WOULD ALL GOINTO HYPNOSIS TOGETHER I DIDN'T REALIZE ON YOU WERE HYPNOTIZING THEM COLLECTIVE YES YES RIGHT FASCINATE AND AND THAT YOU KNOW IF ANYTHING I THINK IT BRINGS OUT THE BEST IN PEOPLE'S ABILITIES BECAUSE IT'S A SHARED SOCIOLE EXPERIENCE AND AND THEY WOULD TALK ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS AND SO YES THAT'S ABSOLUTELY DUABLE AND I DON'T WONT O FOLCAS ON PSYCHODELIC SPECIFICALLY MAYBE THAT S A TOPIC FOR A FUTURE EPISODE BUT IS THERE ANY BASIS FOR COMBINING HYPNOSIS WITH A DRUG THERAPIES INSIDE OF THE HYPNOTIC EPISODE SO I REALIZE THAT SOME PATIENCE OF YOURS MIGHT BE PRESCRIBED A ANTA DEPRESSIN OR A MEDICATION FOR FOR SOME A PURPOSE I MAY BE SAMER DIFFERENT THAN THE HYPNOSISIS BEING DIRECTED TOWARD BUT IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT IF PEOPLE ARE AM RELAX THROUGH THE USE OF A AM PROPRANEL ALL OR SOMEWHAT YOU N ONE OF THESE OF MANY THINGS IN THE PSYCHITRIS KIT THAT HYPNOSIS CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE WELL INTERESTINGLY ONE STUDY THAT I HAVEN'T MENTIONED AS WE DID DA M SPECTROSCOPY ON PEOPLE WHO WERE HYPNOTIZED AND WE FOUND AM THAT THERE WAS A CORRELATION BETWEEN HYPNOTIZED ABILITY AND GABBA ACTIVITY IN THE A ANTERO SINGULAR QUARTECS WHICH FITS WITH TURNING DOWN ACTIVITY SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN SELF MEDICATE AND GABO RECEPTORS BASICALLY OR DOING WHAT BENS OF DAISOPINES DUE TO THE BRAIN I THAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE HYPNOTIZED SO YOU SAYING INSIDE OF THE HYPNOS ASYOU YOU HAVE NERAL EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS A KIND OF A A SET IT OF EFFECT OF HYPNOSIS AT THE CHEMICAL LEVEL YE RIGHT MAS TIT PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE ADNOTIZABLE HAVE MORE OF THOSE GABER RECEPTIVES HAN ITS RELATED TO THE DEGREE OF THEIR HYPNOTOTSABILITY AM IN TERMS OF THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES WHERE THEY TRY TO GIVE PEOPLE MEDICATIONS AS WELL AND THE INTERESTING THING WITH BENS OF THAY IS OPENES WHICH ACTIVATE IN HYPITORY ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN A IF YOU ARE VERY ANXIOUS IT MIGHT IMPROVE YOUR HYPNOTIC RESPONSIV IT IF YOU JUST SO ANXIOUS AN RCANTO IT IF YOU'RE NOT VERY ANXIOUS AND ACTUALLY INHYBITS IPNOTIC ACTIVITY BECAUSE YOU GET SORT OF SEDATED AND JUST OUNT OF IT AND YOU CAN'T FOCUSS YOUR ATTENTION AS WELL SO BY ENLARGE WE DON'T USE DRUGS AS AN AGUENT TO HYPNOTIC EXPERIENCE MOSTY TIME YOU DON'T NEED TO AND SOMETIMES IT CAN MAKE IT WORSE RATHER THAN BETTER SOME THER SOME EVIDENCE THAT MILD STIMULANTS MIGHT ENHANCEHYPNOTIC RESPONSIVENESS A LITTLE RELIABLY BUT TOO MUCH WILL AGAIN SCATTER ATTENTION AND YOU'LL HAVE LESS CONTROL OVER IT SO THEY MIGHT BE ADJUVINTS BUT I FRANKLLY THINK A HYPNOSIS IS MOREOVER REPLACEMENT THAN IN DEED OF SUPPLEMENTATION YOU ARE LABORATORY MY LABORATORY HAVE A WELL A SORT OF SNUCK IN TO YOUR LAVN AND TRYING TO A ANEMERGE THAT YOU HADS BEEN A LOT OF FON AND YOUR HAND LEARNING A LOT ABOUT A THE POWER OF RESPIRATION OF BREATHING TO SHIFT BRAIN STATES NOT JUST DURING BREATHING PROTOCALS BUT A AT ALL TIMES AND WE WILL DO AN ENTIRE EPISODE ABOUT THOSE PROTOCASIT HPO WE A AFTER A THOSE ARE PUBLISHED AND AND AND SO ON BUT BREATHING ITSELF IS A YOUV DESCRIBED AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN CONSCIOUS AN UNCONSCIOUS STATES D AND A SO I HAVE TO ASK HOW HOW IMPORTANT IS THE PATIENTE BREATHING PATTERN HOW CLOSELY ARE YOU MONITERING THEIR BREATHING PATTERN HOW CLOSELY DO YOU MONIDER YOUR OWN BREATHING PATTERN AS YOUR INDUSING HYPNOSIS PUT SIMPLY WHAT IS THE ROLE OF RESPIRAXION IN SHIFTING THE BRAIN'S STATE DURING A HYPNOTIC PROTOCOL AYET THAT'S VERY INTERESTING YOU HAD A GREAT SHOW WITH THE JACT YA JACFELMEN A AND HE HIS AND AND THE THE ISSUE A I I WATCH IT A I TRY THE WORK THAT WERE ENJOING DOING TOGETHER SHOWS THAT THERE ARE BREATHING PATTERNS THAT MAY INCREASE SYMPATHETIC AROUSAL A WERE MADE DECREASE IT MAY HAVE BEEN WE NEL SYCLIC SIGHING SEEMS TO ACTUALLY WHERE YOU HAVE MORE TIME SPENT EXHALING THAN INHALING SEEM AND THERE'S REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IT INDUCES PARIS SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY CAUSE YOUR INCREASING PRESSURE IN THE CHEST AND A THEREFORE A ALLOWING THE HEART TO SLOW DOWN BECAUSE BLOOD IS BEING RETURNED TO THE ATRIUM A MORE EASILY A I DO USE IT I ASKED PEOPLE TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH IS PART OF THE INDUCTION AND AND SLOWLY EX ELL AND PARTLY AS A RESULT OF OUR RESEARCH TOGETHER I AM EMPHASIZING THE SLOW EXHALE MORE AS PART OF AN SOM  TO ENHANCE THE IDEA IN THE INDUCTION THAT THIS IS A PERIOD OF RELAXATION CAUSE I THINK THEY ARE INDUCING THAT AND PERHAPS PERCEIVING IT AS WELL SO EIS NO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT BREATHING IS VERY INTERESTING CAUSE IT'S RIGHT AT THE EDGE OF CONSCIENS AND JACK TALKED ABOUT THAT TO OF CONSCIEOS AND UNCONSCIOUS CONTROL THAT IT WILL GO ON AUTOMATICALLY BUT WE CAN CONTROL IT AND SO IT'S A KIND OF WAY FOR US TO DEMONSTRATE TO OURSELVES A IT IT GREATER WAYS OF AN OF MODULATING OUR INTERNAL STATE SO YOU CAN EITHER DO IT THINKING ABOUT IT THE WAY WE DO WITH PAIN CONTROL IN IT NOISIS OR YOU CAN DO IT TO SOME IC STENT BY TAKING CHARGE OF YOUR BREATHING AND DOING THINGS THAT WILL PRO DUCE THE CHANGE THAT YOU WANT TO SEE HAPPEN IN YOUR BODY SO I I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT AT THAT MORGIN WHERE YOU CAN ENHANCE A FOR ME I LIKE THAT AS A WAY OF AUGMENTING HYPNOIS IS MORE THAN MEDICATION I THINK THIS IS A POWERFUL WAY OF DOING THAT GRAY I'M REALLY XCITE TH SEE WHERE ALL THIS GAES  BREATHING VISION BODILY STATES A CLEARLY THE TE AND DIRECTED MENTAL AM FOCESS SEEM TO BE THE THE KEY ELEMENTS OF HYPNOSIS AN MY MISSING ANY ANY OTHER INGREDIENTS YE IT'S I THINK THAT'S RIGHTERETHENS BREATHING VISION HOW YOU CHANGE YOUR VISION A AND YOU DON'T YOU KNOW ITYOUTYPICALLY YOU'RE IN A PHYSICALLY RELAXED STATE BUT FRANKLLY THERE ARE PEOPLE AT THE PEAK OF PERFORMANCE INCLUDING PHYSICAL ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE OR MUSICAL PERFORMANCE WHEN THEYARE IN HYPNOTIC STATES TO YOU KNOWI HAVE TALK TO CLASSICAL PIANISTS WHO SAY I'M NOT THIN IF I START THINK IT ABOUT WHAT MY FINGERS ARE DOING NOW I SCREW UP YOU KNOW IM FLOATING ABOVE THE PIANO THINKING ABOUT THE NATIV THE TONE THAT I WANT TO FEEL EXUTING FROM THE INSTRUMENT SO THAT'S A HYPNOTICLIKE STATE TO AND IN MANY ATHLETES IN WHO ARE INP PERFORMANCE ARE JUST FLOWING WITH IT THERE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT THINKING STEP BY STEP WHONTOMY DOING AND THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE DO IN YOUR BEST OR YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN WE'RE WORKING OR A GIVING A TALK AND DOING IT WELL WE'RE IN A HYPNOTICLIIC STATE SO IT IT DOESN'T IT IT USUALLY REQUIRES ABUT DOESN'T NECESSARILY REQUIRE PHYSICAL COMFORT OR QUIETNESS THAT CAN SOMETIMES BE INTENSE ACTIVITY INCREDIBLE WELL AM THIS HAS BEEN AMAZING DISCUSSION I'VE LEARNE SO MUCH SI ALWAYS DO FOM YOU A WHERE CAN PEOPLE LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW THEY CAN GET HYPNOTIZED A WE MENTION REVERIE WILL PUT A LINK TO ITS AR E VE E AR I DOT CALM IS THE WAY TO AC US THAT OR IT'S THE REVERI APT FROM THE APSTORTS THE OTHER WAY REVERY NOUBT CALM AS THE WEBSIGHT YOU CAN GET TO IT THROUGH THAT OR DOWNLOR THE REVERI AT FROM THE APSTORE GREAT A SO CURRENTLY ON APPLE HOPEFULLY SOON ALSO AN ENDROYD BUT IN THE MEANTIME A WHAT WHAT IF PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN EXPLORING CLINICAL HYPNOS IS WORKING WITH YOU AR OR SOMEBODY SIMILARIS THERE ARE ESSENTIALIZED RESOURCE THAT PEOPLE CAN GO TO TO FINE AM REALLY A WELL TRAIN HYPNOTISTS THERE ARE TOO GOOD PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS I THAT WILL HELP YOU WITH THAT ONE IS TO SOCIETY FOR CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL HYPNOSIS AND I THINK THAT A S GED O YOU SS IS WE WE WILL UT WILL LOOK IT UP AND PROVIDALING AND THE MERICAN SOCIETY FOR CLINICAL HYPNOSIS AND THEY BOTH PROFIDE REFER AL SERVICES FOR PROFESSIONALS AM YOU CANT LOOK AT UP I WOULD JUST SAY IN GENERAL LOOK FOR SOMEONE WHO IS LICE INSTANT TRAINED IN THEIR PRIMARY PROFESSIONAL DISCIPLINE SOCINTRY PSYCHOLOGY MEDICINE DENISTRY AMAND WHO HAS TRAINING AND INTEREST IN USING HYPNOSIS I IS IS A WAY TO DO IT GREAT AND THEN ONE MORE QUESTION AND THAN A COMMENT AM THE QUESTION IS WILL YOU BE MY PSYCHIITREI MONOR  IF IT'S ALL AI MIGHT BE THAT THOUGHER THE MOST STUVORN PATION I THINK THE HARDEST WORKS ALREADY BEEN DONE AND THANK YOU I KNO WELL AM IN THE FINAL THING AS AS A COMMENT A FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TO DAY FOR CARING YOUR KNOWLEDGE I HOPE WE CAN DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN IAM I LOVE WORKING WITH YOUR LABORATORY AND WITH LIKEWISE BECAUSE I WHEN YOU SPEAK I LEARN AND I LEAR AND AM I KNOW OTHERS TO AS WELL HO WE WILL PUT RESOURCES TO GET TO YOU BUT I ALSO JUST ANCE A THANK YOU FOR DOING THE WORK THAT YOU DO AM IT'S AN INCREDIBLE THING THAT IN THIS WORLD THE WERE WE ARE DISCOVERING SO MUCH ABOUHOW THE BODY WORKS YH ON THE MIND IS STILL RATHER MYSTERIOUS AND PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE LOT OF THINGS BUT ALSO I THINK PEOPLE ARE REALLY EXCITE ABOUT APPLYING TOOLS LIKE HYPNOISIS TO A PERFORM BETTER FEEL BETTER MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY AND SEEVE POINTED US TO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESOURCES AND HOW THESE TOOLS WORK AND WHERE THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATE TO WORK SUCH AS THANK YOU I KNOW THIS IS YOUR A YEUR LIFE'S COMPROFESSIONAL A COMMITMENT IN LIFE AND AND WE ALL BENEFITS TH THANKS YOU BETTEST THAN A REAL JOY FOR ME TO BE COLABORATING WITH YOU AND FOR YOU TO BE USING YOUR PRECISION AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT YOUR ANANOMY NOR BIOLEDGY TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS THAT OFTEN PEOPLE WHO ARE THAT DISCIPLINED IN IN THE PRIMARY NOR BIOLOGICAL AND AREN'T AS INTERESTED IN AS YOU ARE AND SO IT'S REALLY BEEN A PLEASURE TO TRAIN YOU KNOW BRING TOGETHER WHAT WE BOTH KNOW FROM THESE DIFFERENT PORSPECTIVES TO BUILD SOMETHING A THE

MONTH TO TRACK ONE DOWN NOTHE WAY T PUT THAT LAST SENTENCE IF YEU WERE IN A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD VERY EAGER TO SEE TURKEY VULTURES UP CLOSE N ONLY TOOK A MONTH TO FIND A DEER CARCASS NOA RESTLED THE HEAVY BLOODED GHASTIUS YELLOW JACKET COVERED PUTRED SMELLING DEER LY INTO THE TRUNK OF HIS VLF AS SITDOWN GOT HOME PUT THE DEER IN A WHEEL BARROW WEELED IT OUT TO THIS VERY SPOT WERE WE'RE STANDING IN THIS PASTURE AND DUMPED IT SO IT'S LIKE RIGHT HERE WERE WERE STANDING THIS IS THE SPOT I CHOWS THIS POINT IN OUR A BURDWALK WE WERE STANDING WITH AN EYE SHOT OF THE HOUSE AT YEUR UAN WRBUT NOT TOO CLOSE THE COPASTERS OVERGROWN THAT WAS FOR HIS WHITE OAKS AROUND ITS ED O IS ASURKERE I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD SPOT BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE IT FROM THE SKY ITD HAS MULTIPLE APPROACH PABS FROM THE AIR SO THEY WILL BE AS ATTRACTED AS PASSIBLE TO THIS DEER CARCASS IIS DARK SO HE WENT TO BED NO IDEA OF THIS LITTLE WORK GETS UP THE NEXT MORNING AND THERE WERE TURKEY VULTURES EVERYWHERE THEY WERE SITTING ON THESE TREES REGD YER THERE WRE VULTURES SITTING ON THE ROOF OF OUR HOUSE I TEN OF HEM LINED UP ON OUR ROOF THERE RE VULTURES CIRCLING OVERHEAD THEY WERE PROBABLY THIRTY OR FORTY TURKEY VULTURES HANG IT AROUND THE YARD AND WHEN I LOOK UP AND REALIES THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED I WAS SO HAPPY I RUSHED OUT HERE AND ID SET UP A LITTLE CAMIFLAS TARP NEXT TO THE DEER CARCAS HERE WAS O SO THE TARP WAS JUST CUNIT IN THIS WET GRASS SO IF I COME OF A YEAR I WAS HUNKER DOWN RIGHT ABOUT HERE S IF I CAN'T GET DOWN I WAS SITTING UNDER A TARP WITH THE HOLE IN IT IN MY CAMERLANDS STICKING OUT HES MAYBE TEN FEET ROM THE DEER HE WAITED IN AND THEN FINALLY IT WAS LIKE MAGIC THE IRST ONE CAME DOWN AND ONCE ONE CAME DOWN THEY ALL STARTED JUST PILING DOWN IT WASN'T LIKE WHAT HE IMAGINED  THT WAS CAN BE CHAOS WIK A PACK OF LIONS RIPPING INTO HIS EEBRO DOWN HAT UNFOLDED WAS VERY POLITE YETTHEY WERE JUST DELICATELY WALKING AROUND AN STANDING ON TOP OF AT AND STARTING TO PICK AT IT GINGERLY IT WASN'T LIKE A BRUTE FORCE KIND OF THING AT ALL AND THEY WERE VERY WELL BEHAVED I THOUGHT THER WAS ALMOST LIKE A PECKING ORDER INVOLVE THEY KNEW WHICH BIRDS WE'RE GET TO EAT FIRST AND THEY ADHEERE TO IT SO I SOAS VERY ORDERLY IT WAS AN ORDERLY SEEN OF TURKEY VULTURES EATING THEIR BREAKFAST WHERE DO THEY STARTE I THOUGHT I WAS SO CALL SO THE SOFTEST PARTS OF THE DEER THAT'S WHERE THE TURKEY VULTURES WOULD START STICKING THEIR HEADS INTO THEY DIDN'T LIKE I WAS EXPECTING THEM TO TEAR A BIG HOLE IN THE SIDE AND JUST GO AT IT BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED AT ALL THEY ACTUALLYT STARTED BY PECKING THE EYES OUT I GUESS THOSE OF THE SOFTEST PART OF THE DEER SO THEY WENT FOR THE EYEBALLS AND THEN THEY WENT IN AND VERY CAREFULLY ATE THE GUMS OUT OF THE DEER LIKE AROUND ITS TEETH THEYFTR GO VOR THE SOFT PARTS CONSIDEREN A VERY STRONG FEELING OR BEAKS INSTEAD A TURKEY VHICHER JUST CUT IT STICKS ITS HEAD UP INSIDE THE BODY ITTENDED BAWL AND RED WITH NO FEATHERS ETWHICH IS HANDY FOR STICKING INSIDE OF CARCASSES AND NOT GETTING YOUR FEATHERS ALL MEST OUT THE TURKEY VHOCHRAS NEXT STARTED EATING AROUND THE WOUND ON THE DEER'S SHOULDER M WHERE GOT HID ON THE HIGHWAY TOOK TURNS EATING ROUND THERE TILL

I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY HOURS I SPENT OUT HERE THAT WEEK BUT IT WAS FULL AFTERNOONS PRETTY MUCH EVERY DAY ALL WEK LONG SO I GOT TO SEE THE WHOLE PROCESS AT THE BEGINNING THE DEER CARCASS WAS RELATIVELY FRASH AND THEN GRADUALLY IT WAS STRIPPED AWAY AND BY YOU KNOW DAY FIVE OR DAY SIX THEY WERE STARTING TO DISASSEMBLL THE SKELETON THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH PICKED CLEAN IT WAS LIKE BEING DRAWN INTO ANOTHER WORLD THAT EXISTS IN THIS WORLD THAT WE ARE VERY SELDOM APART OF BEING SO CLOSE TO THESE BIRDS THAT DON'T NORMALLY ALLOW US TO GET THACK CLOSE TO THEM WHAIS LIKE PASSING THROUGH SOME KIND OF FORCE FIELD OR SOMETHING AND EMERGING ON THEIR SIDE OF THE DIVIDE AND FEELING THAT N THEIR WORLD IS NOT THE SAME AS OURS NO AN IT IS EXISTED FOR MUCH LONGER THAN OURS HAS  I MEAN HUMANITY IS NOT THAT OLD

SPACKBIRD THAT STRUTDED A PLUDICAL FITE A FIGHT THAT IS LASTIT FOR A VERY LONG TIME CONSERNING ONE STATES OFFICIAL STATE BIRD BE MADA WON ME TELLS THE TALE THE THING ABOUT AN OFFICIAL STATE BIRD IS THAT IT JUST REALLY DOESN'T MATTER I SAY THAT WITH NO INTENDED DISRESPECT TO BIRD AS ACROSS THE NATION SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS A BIRDARS BUT THINK ABOUT IT ON WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAT DOWN AND TRULY CONSIDERED THE CISERTELLED FLY CATCHER WHO IS THE AVIAN EMBODIMENT OF THE STATE OF OCLAHOMER EXACTLY IT'S ABSURD IT STATE BIRD HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STATES G D P FOR EXAMPLE IT DOESN'T TELL US HOW HAPPY THE CHILDREN ARE IT MAKES NO ONE'S LIFE MATERIALLY BETTER OR WORSE AND YET IN FLORIDA THE DEBATE ABOUT WHICH FLYING ANIMAL DESERVES THE TITAL OF OFFICIAL STATE BIRD HAS BEEN ON GOING FOR MORE THAN TWO DECATES THE STATE BIRD MEANS NOTHING BUT SOMEHOW IN FLORIDA IT'S COME TO ME IN A HELLOF A LOTS FLORIDA WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE FIRT STATES TO DESIGNATE A STATE BIRD BACK IN NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN IT WAS PLOBABLY A SIMPLE CHOICE THE NORTHERN MOCKING BIRD IS A GOOD BIRD AS BIRDS GO IT LIKES THE SAYING IT HAS AN INCREDIBLE TALENT FOR MIMICRY AND WITH ITS GRAY COLORING IT'S CUTE HERE'S THE THING BIR THE NORTHERN MOCKING BIRD IS THE OFFICIAL BIRD OF ANOTHER FOUR STATES BESIDES FLORIDAR ITS ACTUALLY THE THIRD MOST POPULAR STATE BRD BEHIND THE NORTHERN CARDINAL AND THE WESTERN MEADOW LARK AFTER SEVENTY TWO YEARS SOME PEOPLE THAT HAD ENOUGH OF THIS SPREADSTIN STAE BIRD ENTER THE SPARK BIRD OF THE STORY THE SCRUBJA THE FLORIDE SCRUBJAY IS THE ONLY BRD ON THE PLANET THAT IS FOUND ONLY IN FLORIDAR IT'S A STURDY LOOKING BIRD WITH TAE DULL BLUE HEAD AND WINGS IT'S UN CLARE EXACTLY WY THE LATE REPUBLICAN REP HOWWOARD FUTCH WAS SUCH A CHAMPION FOR THE SCRUBJAY BUT IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE HE COSPONSITO BILL FOR IT TO BECOME THE STATE BIRD MAYBE IT WAS THE FACT THAT FUTCH REPRESENTED BRAVAD COUNTY WHICH USED TO HAVE THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF SCRUBJAYS IN THE STATE BUT I THINK HE JUST LIKES THE BIRD ISS HE PUT IT IT'S GOT GOOD FAMILY VALUES IT'S KIND AND IT'S A BIRD THAT LIKES PEOPLE SCRUBJAYES DO SOMETHING CALLED COOPERATIVE BREEDING WHICH MEANS THAT EACH NEST HAS AN ADALT PAIR BUT IT ALSO HAS HELPERS USUALLY THE OLDER SIBLINGS OF THE NEW E SJAY BABIES WHO HELP FEED THE YOUNG AND DEFENTERAJRY VERY DIFFERENT IN FUDGHIS OPINION FROM THE MOCKING BIRD THE MOCKING BIRD A LOT OF PEOPLE LOVE THAT SUCKER HE SAID BUT IT'S PRETTY MEAN PCH THERE'S NOTHING HUMAN BEINGS CANNOT MAKE ABOUT THEMSELVES EVEN BIRDS AND THE FIGHT OVER THE FLORID E STATE BIRD VERY QUICKLY BECAME LOADED WITH FAMILIAR POLITICAL TROPES ON THE SIDE OF THE STATE AS QUOR THE SIDE OF THE INCUMBENT MOCKING BIRD WAS ONE A FLORIDA'S MOST FAMOUS SENIAS MARRIAN HAMMER HAMER IS A LONG TIME LOBBIUS WITH THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION AND THE ARCHITECT OF FLORIDA STAND YOUR GROUND LAW AND SHE IS NO FAN OF THE FLORID A SCRUBJAY IN HER COMMITTEE TESTIMONY HAMMER DISMISSED THE BIRD AS A THIEVING SCROUNGER IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE TERMS THEY EAT THE EGGS OF OTHER BIRDS SHE SAID THAT'S ROBBERY AND MURDAR AND IN RESPONSE TO THE SCRUBJAYS ALLEGED FRIENDLINESS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE WADE EATS OUTI HUMAN'S HANDS SHE HAD A REBUTTLE BEGGING FOR FOOD ISN'T SWEET IT'S LAZY AND IT'S A WELFAREMENTALITY THE RESPONSE FROM THE OTHER SIDE WAS JUST AS HARSH DEMOCRAT RAP MARK PAFFERD CALLED THE MOCKING BIRD AND OBNOXIOUS PLAGERIZING AND PROMISCUOUS B ULLY STATE REP FURCH AND THE SCRUB A HAD THE AUDIBAN SOCIETY ON THEIR SIDE AND THEY ALSO HAD A CHUNK OF FLORIDAR CITIZENS SCHOOL CHILDREN THOUSANDS OF THEM SINED A

WORD ABOUT WHAT I FIND INTERESTING ABOUT THIS NEXT STORY I'M I THINK EVERY COUPLE THERE'RE THE THINGS THAT YOU SHARE AND TALK ABOUT WITH EACH OTHER AND YOU NO THEN OTHER THNG YOU DON'T SHOR SO MUCH BUT EACH COUPLE HAS O KIND OF INVENT OR DISCOVER THE TERRITORY OF STUFF THAT THEY HAVEN'T COMMEN AND WHERE THEY MEET UP AND THE MORE STUFF IN THE TERRI TORY PROBY THE BETTER CAUS THE MORE CHIGAS YO HAVE DO CONNECTIVE FOR CLOSEAN ALL THAT THE COUPLE IN THIS STORY THEY HAD THEIR STUFF THEY WERE YOU DON'T EVEN RAISING KIDS TOGETHER WITH OTB IS A HUGE THING LIKE THAT BUT AS THE KID'S GOT ORDER THE COUPLE INVENTED THIS WHOLE OTHER ORIGINAL COMMON GROUND FOR THEMSELVES ALSO THIS BIRDS SHON CALL EXPLAINS BEFORE I GET INTO WHAT THE STORIES ABOUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THE COUPLE IN QUESTION PETER AND HIS WIFE MATTY ARE NORMAL PEOPLE THEY MUST BE MAT I I GRATS S YEAR O TAN THEYETER HOWEIN NORTHHAND IN MASSACHUSETTS IS SO NORMAL ITS OF AGE FOUR BEDROOMS UPSTAIRS ON FOR EACH KID PETER AND MATTY CRAMMED THEMSELVES INTO THE ATTIC FOR A LONG TIME THERE ARE BLENDED FAMILY PETER CAME TO THE MARRIAGE WITH TWO SONS MATTY HAS A SON AND A DAUGHTER ALL OF THEM ARE GROUND DOING WELL NOW 'S JUST THE PARENTS AT HOME ACEN SMATY WORKS IS A LAWYER RECENTLLY ONE O BIG CASE THROUGH THE INNOCENTES PROJECT SO I DO TRIAL WORK AND I DO A PALLAWOR SO I AW PETER IS A PROFESSIONAL MUSICIAN NUST TOWARDS EUROPE PLAYING BOCK ARRANGEMENTS ON A SPECIAL GUITAR HE DESIGNED YOU'L LIKE I BEEN AN ARTISSTALL MY LIFE REALLY AL WHY THINK OM REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THAT LIKE AND IT'S FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS NOW A SIZIBLE NUMBER OF THEIR CONVERSATIONS WITH EACH OTHER CONCERN A FAMILY OF IMAGINARY BIRDS WITH WHOM THEY LIVE SIX BIRDS WHO DO NOT EXIST AND YET EACH HAVE NAMES AND DISTING T PERSONALITIES SUCCESSES AN FAILURES MOST OF THEM HAVE CORRESPONNING STUFFED ANIMALS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM PETER AND MATTY MIGHT SPEND MORE TIME TALKING ABOUT THESE BIRDS THAN ABOUT ANYTHING IN REALITY THE BIRDS LIVES RESEMBLE THOSE OF GREAT SCHOOL CHILDREN THEY ATTEND BIRD ACADEMY RIGHT THERE ON THE BIRD BUS AND THEY'R KIND OF LITTLE MENACES ALWAYS ACCIDENTALLY SPILLING THINGS ON THEMSELVES AND THROWING PARTIES OF THE HOUSE WHEN PETER AND MATY WERE AWAY YET THEY SOMEHOW ALSO MEDDLED IN THE OLYMPICS AND RECORTED TO GRAMMYA WORD WINNING RECORD HERE'S MATTI IT'S ODD I MEAN I KNOW IT'S OT APON REFLECTION BECAUSE IT'S LIKE THIS ISN'TEEN STORY LI NOW IT'S EVERY DAY AND IT'S LIKE WOVEN ALL THROUGH THE DAY AND FOR EXAMPLE IF I WAS DOING SOMETHING AT WORK LECT A DIFFICULT MEETING WITH E CLIAND A A JAILOR SOMETHING THEN AFTERWARDS WHEN I WOULD CALL PETER TO SAY YOU KNOW I'M ON MY WAY HOME OR WHATEVER THEN HE WOULD SAY HOW HOWAR THE BIRDS LIKE HOW DID THEY DO AND THEN I WOULD SAY TERRIBLE USUALLY USUALLY THE BIRDS DO TERRIBLY SO THE BIRDS HAD A TANTHUM IN THE CAR WITH MY COLLAGU THE BIRDS WERE RUDE TO THE INVESTIGATOR LIKE THAT'S SORT OF HOWIT A RISE IS A LOT IS ASKING HOW THE BIRDS MANAGED WHAT WE WERE MANAGING SORT OF LIKE WHEN PETER WENT UP TO MAME TO VISIT A SONCHESTER HO JUST FIXED UP AN OLD BOAT THAT HE WAS SAILING AND LIVING ON WHICH PETER'S REALLY PROUD OF HIM FOR HAVING ACCOMPLISHED AND A OF COURSE WONE I'M ON THE PHOME WITH MATTY CALLIN HER FROM UP THERE IT SLIKE WELL THE BIRDS THEREALLY LIKE THE BOAT THE BOAT IS REALLY SMALL IT'S REALLY THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GET YOU LIKE THE BOAT ON SUCCESSION ON THE TEVISHO SUCCESSION H TIE YACHT WHICH BY THE WAY IS NOT HOW PETER FELT ABOUT THE BOAT THE VIEWS AND OPINIONS OF THE BIRDS DO NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT TO THOSE OF PETER AND MATTY SOMETIMES THEY DO BUT IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE IT'S MORE LIKE THEIR THIS MESSY GREEK CHORUS THAT ALWAYS HAS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN FACTORED INTO ALMOST EVERY EXPERIENCE IT'S LIKE A VERY ELABORATE RUNNING JOKE THEY LIKE SEEING WHAT EACH OTHERS CAN AT COME UP WITH NEXT POKE FUN AT EACH OTHER VEE OF THE BIRDS PUSHIN PULL AND GO NO THE BIRDS DON'T DO THAT THE BIRDS THROUG THIS YOU KNO THERE WULE TALKING ABOUT YOU NOW THE BIRDS HATESKATING YOU KNOW  IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW WE WUT OT BIRDS O ICE THE BIRDS HAVAN ANNUAL O THAN COGBIRIT FASSED WHICH IS ALWAYS CANCOLD AT THE LAST MINUTE AT THE LAST MINUTE IT WILL TURN OUT THEY DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A PERMINUTE THEY HADN'T REALLY SPOKEN TO BE ON FACE MNA JAR THE THROWING OUT IDEAS AND COMING TO A CONSENSIS IS A LOT OF HOW THEY BUILT THE BIRD WORLD FOR INSTANCE SO THE BIRDS ARE RALY ING TO MILKSHAKES THEIR BIRDMOBILES ERE OUTFITTED WITH SPECIAL SHAKE MACHINES BUT THEY FIDTLE LAW SUIT AGAINST SHAKESHEK AFTER ONE OF THEM GOT HIS HEAD FEATHERS CAUGHT IN A CEILING FAN WHICH IS REALLY ASHAME BECAUSE THE BIRDS LOVESHAKESHI THEY'RE NOT BEEND FROM SHAKESHA NOT BEN BUT T MUST HAVE SOURED THEM ON THE WHOLE SHAKESHAK EXPERIENCE I I DON'T THINK SO MONY THEY GOT A TONOMONEY AND THEY STILL CAN GET SHAKESTHERE  YE IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY TOO THIS IS THE FIRST TIME PETER AND MATTIY HAVE EVER TALKED ABOUT THE BIRDS IN FRONT OF ANY ONE NOTT OTHER THAN THEIR KIDS AND PETER'S THERAPIST ONCE OR TWICE IN PASSING THEY'VE NEVER MENTIONED THE BIRDS TO A SINGLE SOUL UNTIL NOW IT'S JUST TOO OUT THERE THEY TOLD ME AND TOO HARD TO EXPLAIN WHICH MEANS THIS IS ALSO THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE HAD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BIRDS THEY'VE NEVER EXAMINED ANY OF THIS EVEN IN PRIVATE SO WHEN I ASKED THEM SOMETHING LIKE WHY THEY DO IT OR WHAT THEY GET OUT OF IT THEY REALLY HAD TO PUZZLE TOGETHER THOSE ANSWERS IN REAL TIME AS THIY SAT WITH THEM I'M NOT TRIT TO LIKE YE I'M NOT TRY TO SELL YOU DON'N'T SAY I'M JUST REPORTING IT THAT IT'S HAPPENING HERE AND THE WHOLE THING WITH THE BIRDS IT ISN'T JUST FRIVOLOUS IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN HELPFUL IN THE FAMILY IN SOME WAYS UN HURTFUL TOO WHICH I'LL GET TO BUT JUST TO SAY O IT BEGAN SO THE BIRDS FIRST ENTERED THEIR LIVES ABOUT A DOZEN YEARS AGO WHEN MATTY'S DAUGHTER PETER'S STEPDAUGHTER EVA BUT MATTY A LITTLE STUFFED TWAY MONSTER TECHNICALLY IT WAS SOMETHING CALLED AN UGLY DOLL BUT TO MATTY IT LOOKED LIKE A BIRD EVA WAS ONLY ABOUT TWELVE YEARS OLD AT THE TIME AND I DO THINK IT WAS THE FIRST THING THAT SHE HAD EVER BOUT FOR ME SO IT WAS A VERY SWEET GEFT AND I JUST LEVED AT SO MUCH AND THEN I GAVE IT THIS FELLY NAME BIRDLY SO BIRDLY WAS THE SPARK BIRD THE BIRD THAT SPARKED THE CAPITAL BEE BIRDS MATTIY STARTED BRINGING BIRDLY EVERYWHERE BIRDLEY WROTE IN THE CAR WITH HER SHE TOOK HIM ON VACATION PETER WOULD IDLY TOSS HIM TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BED AND MATTY WOULD BE LIKE HAY CAREFUL AND THIS HADN'T DAWNED ON MATTI UNTIL WE TALKED ABOUT IT BUT THIS WAS A ROUND THE SAME TIME THAT HER CUSTODY ARRANGEMENT WITH HER EX HUSBAND WAS CHANGING USED TO BE THE KIDS WOULD EVER BE AWAY FROM HER FOR MORE THAN THREE DAYS AT A TIME BUT THEN THEY SWITCHD TO ONE WEEK ON ONE WEEK OFF AND IN THE BEGINNING THE WEEK THAT I DID NOT HAVE THEM FOUT LIKE AN AT TURNITY I COULDN'T YOU KNOW IS A CHALLENGE I THINK IT WAS FAIR AND I THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO BUT THAT WAS THE PERIOD THAT I WAS MISTHING MY CHILDREN SO I THINK THAT MA HAV BEEN WHY TAT SUPERA TOCHED EVEN TO THE BIRD THAT SHE GAVE ME AND VERY QUICKLY BIRDLEY GREW PERSONALITY OF HIS OWN TADVENTUREUS IRRESPONSIBLE MATTIAVELLIAN HE' TAKE OUR CRETICARDS IN PETER AND MATTIE'S NAMES ANEGLECT TO FILIS TAXES FOR FIVE YEARS BUT MATTY WOULD DOTE ON HIM NONE THE LESS AT FIRST I FOUND BIRDLY REALLY ANNOY SHE JUST GOT SO EXAGGERATED ABOUT HOW LIKE PRECIOUS HE WAS AND HOW AND I WOULD JUST FEE LIKE O K YOU KNOW AT PLEASE AND THEN SOMEWHERE I CROSSED SOME LINE AND MOVED OVER INTO A YOU KNOW WELL HE DOESN'T YOU HE DIDN'T DO A THING TO HEL DO THE DISHES SIR SOMETHING YOU KOW IK PARTICIPATING IT IT YOU KNOW AND THEN IT  SHE'D BE LIKE WHAT HE HAD TO WORK ON HIS PRESENTATION FOR SCHOOL TOMORROWS LIKE WE THE PSYCHOLOGIST AND MARRIAGE EXPERT JOHN GOTIM AND TALKS ABOUT HOW COUPLES ERE ALWAYS SENDING EACH OTHER THESE LITTLE REQUESTS FOR ATTENTION SUBTLE LIKE WO WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT SUNSET SOMETIMES THE OTHER PARTNER TO SHRUGS BUT IN SOME COUPLES THE MORE CONTENTED ONES THE PARTNER RESPONDS ENTHUSIASTICALLY LIKE AH WHOW YET IT'S BEAUTIFUL THINK THE BIRDS ARE A REQUEST LIKE THAT SOMETIMES THE BIRDS WILL EVEN SWOOP IN AND HELP THEM COMMUNICATES SOMETHING THAT'S DIFFICULT TO EXPRESS LIKE THIS ONE TIME HE'S FINE NOW BUT PETER WAS DEATHLY ILL YET ABACTERIAL INFECTION IN HIS SPINE AND THEY WERE DRIVING BACK FROM A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT WHERE THEY'D GOT IN SOME BAD NEWS THE WOOD IN THE CAR WAS DIR AND AFTER SAYING NOTHING FOR A LONG TIME PETER GOES OH WE HAVE TO STOP AT THEM ALL THE BIRDS WANT TO GO TO THEM ALL I MEAN WHAT ELS IE GAN A SAY RII REMEMBERED AS THE BEST WAY FOR ME TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME I MEAN YOU KI YOU CAN'T TELL HER NOT TO WORRY BUT BUT YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE BIRDS WHAT ABOUT THE BIRDS THEY WONT WONT OF THEM ALL O  AND THEN HER'S THE WAY IN WHICH THE BIRDS HAVE NOT BEEN SO GREAT FOR THE FAMILY AGAIN THEYR FOUR KIDS AND THEY EACH HAD SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT RESPONSES TO BIRD WORLD THE OLDEST TORSTON THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF FUNNY AND HE LEFT FOR COLLEGE ANYWAY NOT LONG AFTER IT STARTED HANK WAS INDIFFERENT EXCEPT THAT IT AS SOME KIND OF CODE THAT IS PARENT SHE IS TO COMMUNICATE CHESTER THE VERY YOUNGEST OF THE FOR THOUGHT IT WAS ANNOYING AND NOT FUNNY AND THEN THERE WAS EVA WHO AGAIN GAVE MATTY HER MOTHER THE DOLL IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WHO WAS THE MOST AGRIEVED OL I WAS DEVENLY JEALOUS THIS IS EVA SHE'S TWENTY FIVE NOW I WAS JEALOUS OF BIRDLY I DON'T KO IF I FELT FORGOTTIN BUT I WAS DOVENLY JEALOUS NOW AS THE YOUNGEST OF MATTY'S TWO KIDS EVA WAS USED TO BEING THE BABY DOTED ON SHOWERED WITH AFFECTION AND SUDDENLY SHE HAD TO BEAR WITNESS TO THIS OVERWHELMING OVERWEENING GUYSER OF PRAISE AND ATTENTION HER MOM GAVE BIRDLY AND THE OTHER BIRDS THE THEME THAT BOTHERS ME THE MOST IS LIKE IF YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR LIFE AND THEN THE BIRDS HAVE THEIR OWN THING ABOUT THEIR LIFE IT WOULD BE LIKE IF YOU GOTS AND A THE BIRDS EITHER GOT IN APPLUS PLAS OR THEY GOT IN F MINESS BUT MOMM IS STILL SOMEHOW LIKE MORE INTERESTED IN THEIR AF MINESS THAT SHE IS IN YOUR AY WHICH JEMPSER WASN'T TRUE BUT THAT'S JUST HOW IT FELT AT THE TIME SO LIKE TATS REALLY WHEN THE INTENSE DISLIKE OF PERFECTLY BEGAN TO FILT AND BUILLED AND BUILLED AND BUILLED UNTIL SOMETIMES AT EXPLODED I DON'T THINK I WAS CLEAR ENOUGH THAT I WASN'T KITTING WHEN I AM SAYING THAT THE BIRDS THING BOTHERS ME I'M NOT PLAYING ALONG WITH THE BIRD UNIVERSE WHERE NOBODY LIKES THE BIRDS AND THEIR STICKY AND ANNOYING AND THEY'RE FAILING OUT OF CLASSES AND THEIR TEACHERS ARE REPORTING THEM I REALLY REALLY DON'T LIKE IT LIKE I COULDN'T SAY THAT OR I WASN'T SAYING IT RIGHT SO THINK THAT IT WAS LIKE IT ALWAYS FELT LIKE IT WAS PLAYING ALONG UNTIL I HAD A TAM DRAM AND I WOULD SCREEM MAT HER THAT THEY'RE NOT REAL WHICH A THINK DID HURT HER FEELINGS AND LOOKING BACK ON IT NOW EVA SAYS HER MOTHER WAS GIVING HER AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF ATTENTION AFFECTION PRAISE ALL OF THAT BUT BACK THEN SHE REALLY FELT LIKE SHE WAS IN COMPETITION FOR IT AND AFTER ALL THE BIRDS DIDN'T DESERVE IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEM NOT EXISTING IN ALL ANYWAY FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS WHO WAS JUST BIRDLY JUST THE ONE BIRD AND THEN THIS ONE FATEFUL DAY EVA TOOK ACTION I'D HAD ENOUGH AND I STOLE HIM ND I HID HIM BETWEEN THE BOX SPRING AND THE MATTRESS OF THE BED THAT I SLEPT ON AM AND I FORGOT THAT I DID THAT I HONEST TO GOODNESS FOR GOT THATI HAD DONE THAT I FELT PANIC I TORD THE HOUSE O PAR I MEAN I FELT THE PENIC THAT YOU FE IF YOU HAVIN IN DOR OU DAR CAT AND THEY DON'T COME HO MAT NI I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF THAT I HAD YOU NOWT CARELESSLY LOST TIM WHICH OF COURSE IN EVA'S MIND CONFIRMED ALL OF HER FEARS THAT MATTIE LOVED BIRDLY MORE O GOT EVEN MORE JEALOUS AND THEN FINALLY PETER WENT OUT AND BOUGHT ANOTHER BIRDLY EXACTLY THE SAME DOLL SAME COLLOR WHOLL THING BUT INSTEAD OF TELLING MATTIE LIKE HERE HONEY I KNOW HOW MUCH HE MIST THAT DOLL SO I BOUGHT YOU ANOTHER ONE HE CLAIMED TO HAVE FOUND THE ORIGINAL BIRDLY WHICH WAS JUST MORE WILFUL SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEVE LIKE OF COURSE BIRDLY ISN'T SOME ONE YOU CAN JUST GO OUT AND PURCHASE AT A STORE ANY OLD TIME HE'S UNIQUE A BIRD IN A MILLION AND THIT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR MATTIE FELT A LOT BETTER BUT THEN COME A MONTHS AFTER THAT MATTIE'S DOING A REALLY THOROUGH CLEANING OF THE HOUSE IS INNER DAUGHTER EVA'S ROOM TURNS THE MATTRESS OVER YEU CAN SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING  SHE COMES TO ME AND SHE'S LIKE LOOK WHAT I FOUND YOU KNOW AND I WAS LIKE THAT'S THAT'S YOURE RIGHT THAT'S BIRDLY AND THAT'S BECAUSE ALL THIS WHILE HIS TWIN SISTER HAS BEEN PRETENDING TO BE HIM TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER WHILE HE WAS HE HAD TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND IS TWEN SISTER BEING THE NEWER MORE PLANT CLEANER ONE RICHT BA WHO HAD AN AMAZING LIKE THIS FOR HIM IT'S LIKE OUT OF YOU KNOW WHAT IS TWELFTEH NIGHT OR'S SOMETHING YOU KNOW IT'S DISLIKE SOME I CONTROUD OF THAT O ALTHOUGH I'M ALSO HE BEWILDERED BY IT AND SHE JUST LOVED THAT SO THAT IS HOW BIRDLE DAT WAS BON BIRD LEDETT BIRDLEY'S TWIN AND SOON ALL THE OTHER BIRDS JOIND THE FLOCK TO ONE OF PETER'S SONS GAVE MATTY ADOLL SHE CALLED DOCTOR BODLY HE LOOKS A LITTLE LIKE A ROBOT AND THAT HE'S A BIRD AND A DOKTAC HE IS RECEIVED THE NO BOUT PRIZE FOR MEDICIN FOR HAVING CURED SPACETHRASH EVA GAVE ME THE INSIDEER SCHOOP ON DOCTOR BODLEY HE'S ALSO MISSANG I THINK THAT I HIT HIM AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE IS GARRENTLY MISSING HE'S BEEN MISSING FOR YEARS BUT IF YASMAM SHE'LL TELL YOU HE'S ON SEDATICAL NEXT CAME HOBILETTA WER HOOBSY SHE'S AN OWL TEN THERE'S PANGUENA A PENGUIN STUDYING TO BE A BIRD MOBILE MECHANIC HE IS LIKE IN THE CAR AAND WE IS HIM AS LIKE A LOMBAR PILLOW AND FINALLY THERE'S WING WHO HE'S NOT EMBODIED NO PHYSICAL INCORPORATION WHATSOEVER STUFFED OR OTHERWISE SO AT THIS POINT EVA'S ORIGINAL GOAL TO DISAPPEAR BIRDLEY SO THAT MATTE WOULDN'T PAY SO MUCH ATTENTION TO HIM COULD NOT HAVE BACK FIRED MORE BADLY HER PARENTS CONVERSATIONS NOW INVOLVED EXACTLY FIVE HUNDRED PER CENT MORE BIRDS THAN THERE HAD BEEN AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE HER OLDER BROTHER TORSTIN WHEN HE WAS HOME WOULD OCCASIONALLY GET INTO THE ACT EGGING THEIR MOTHER ON TO KEEP TELLING BIRD STORIES AND AGAIN HIT WAS LIKE IT THERE'S NO MALICE THERE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS JUST TO SAYE AS ANY OTHER TEASING THAT WE AS A FAMILY DID ALL THE TIME BUT I FELT REPLACED LIKE T YOU KNOW AND THERE'S LIKE THERE'S NO WAY THAT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED CAS WHATE US JUST EVEN SAY AFTER HAVING YOLT YELLED AT TAN I KNOW THE BIRDS ARE FAKE LIKE I HATE YOU I HATE YOU IN YOUR FIK BIRDS THEY'RE NOT REAL THERE'S STUFFED ANIMALS TO THEN BE LIKE BUT ALSO I DO FEEL THER REAL AND YOU'RE HURTING MY

THEY ARE HAVING SIGNIFICANT SOCHAL EMOTIONAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AN PACT ON YOUR LIFE LIKE I DON'T SEE WHAT'S REALER THAN THAT EVA SAYS SHE'S STILL NOT OF FAN OF THE BIRDS THESE DAYS BUT IN THE LAST COUPLE

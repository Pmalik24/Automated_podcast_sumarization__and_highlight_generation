TRACK OF THE THINGS THAT DELIGHT HIM AND THAT'S THINGS THAT'S PEOPLE THATS MOMENT WHATEVER AND THE WORD HE USED WAS NEGLIGENCE HE SAID IT'S A NEGLIGENCE IF PEOPLE DOEN'T TAKE THE TIME TO HONOR THE THINGS THAT THEY TAKE DELIGHT IN THE MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT THEY SHARE THE THINGS THAT THEY TAKE DELIGHT IN AND IF YOU DON'T DO THAT THERE'S THERE'S A LOSS THER YOU HAVE TO DO IT TO ACHIEVE HUMANITY YOU HAVE TO SHARE DELIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT WE CAN BE DOING TODAY RIT YES THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WAS OTO BEDOING TO DAY WE GAN A THINK ABOUT WHAT DELIGHTS US HYIT DELIGHTS ATS WHITES IMPORTANCE TO CULTIVATE DELIGHT AND WITH THAT ON ME JUST HAND OVER T SHOWED YOU YOUR HOS TE SHOW FROM HERE I CEEN TO PY WE SITIN TO BE THE ASY CHICAGO I READIT I CAN HID IT IS IT D B EASY HED SURE O CET FROM DOUBL  B EAS AT CHICAGO IT'S THIS AMERICAN LIGHT AN THEY MIGHY ONE ME SAY WITH US AT ONE THE JOB OF DELIGHT IT'S ONE THING TO BE A TUNED TO DELIGHT BUT I'S QUITE ANOTHER TO SCRAPE OFF E SAMPLE STICK IT ON A SLIGHT AND PLACE IT ONDER A MICROSCOP ENTER ROSGAY THE PARET I WAS TALKING ABOUT A MOMENT AGO ROS IS AN ENGLISH PROFESSOR AT INDIANA UNIVERSITY AND A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO HE EMBARKED ON A SPECIFIC MISSION TO THINK ABOUT DELIGHT HE MADE IT A PRACTICE IN FACT FOR ONE CALENDER YEAR ROS WOULD ASK HIMSELF WHAT DELIGHTS ME AND THEN HE WOULD WRITE IT DOWN HE SET RULES HE WOULD DO IT EVERY DAY HE WOULD DROP THEM QUICKLY AND EVERY SINGLE DELIGHT WOULD BE WRITTEN MY HAND HE CALLED THEM ESSAY ITS SOME OF THESE I SAY ITS EVENTUALLY BECAME A BOOK THE BOOK OF DELIGHT HEE'S ROS READING AN EXCEPT OF DELIGHT NUMBER EIGHTY FROM THE BOOK TO MOTO ON BOARD IN HIS LIVING ROOM IN BLOOMINGTON WOULD YOU DON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU CARRY A TOMATO SEEDLING THROUGH THE AR PORT NON TO A PLAIN IS IT CARRYING A TOMATO SEEDLING THROUG THE IR PORT NON TO A PLAIN WILL MAKE PEOPLE SMILE AT YOU ALMOST LIKE YOUR CARRYING A BABY I DID NOT KNOW THIS UNTIL TODAY CARRYING MY LITTLE TOMATO ABOUT THREE OR FOUR INCHES HIGH IN ITS FOUR INCH PLASTIC STARTAPAT WHICH MY FRIEND MICHAEL GAVE TO ME SMIRKING ABOUT HOW I WAS GOING TO GET AT HOME SOMETHING ABOUT THIS AT FIRST FELT NODDY THAT COMPARING AT TOMATE A TO A BABY BUT CARRING THE TOMATE ON TO THE PLAIN AND SO I SLIT THE THING INTO MY BAG WHOD GOING THROUGH SECURITY WHICH MADE THEN PULL THE BAG FOR INSPECTION WHEN THE SECURITY GUI SAWHIT WATH A TOMATO  SMILED AND SAID I DONNOW HOW TO CHECK THAT HAVE A GOOD DAY BUT I QUICKLY REALIZED O ONE OF ITS TEMS WHICH I ALMOST WROTE HIS ARMS WHIT'S BROKE IN FROM THE JASLING AND IT ONLY HAD FOUR OF THEM SO I DECIDED I'D BETTER JUST CARRY IT OUT IN THE OPEN AND THE SHOWER OF LAVE BEGAN BEFORE BOARDING THE FINAL LEG OF MY FLIGHT ONE OF THE WORKERS SAYD ICE TOMATO WHICH I DON'T THINK WAS A COMELEN AND THE FLIGHT AT TENDENT ASKED ABOUT THE TOMATO AT LEAST FIVE TIMES NOT IN EXAGGERATION EVERY TIME CALLING IT MY TOMATO WHERE'S MY TOMADO HOW'S MY TOMADO HE DIDN'T LOSE MY TOMATO DID YOU SHE EVEN'T DIRECTED ME TO AN OPEN SEAT IN THE EG XIT RO I YOU GAS GO SIT THERE AND STRETCH OUT I GATHERED MY THINGS AND SET THE LO GUY IN THE WINDOW SEATS A SHE COULD LOOK OUT WHEN I GOT MY WATER I POURED SOME INTO THE LOGI SOIL WHEN WE GOT BUMPY I PUT MY HAND ON THE LOWGUIS CONTAINER CAREFUL NOT TO SNAP ANOTHER ARMOR AND WHEN WE LANDED AN THE PILOT PUT THE BREAKS ON HARD MY ARM REFLECTSIVELY WHEN ACROSS THE SEA HOLDING THE LOGIAN PLACE THE WAY MY DADS ARM WOULD WHEN HE HAD TO BREAK IN THAT CAR WITHOUT SEETBOUTS TO SPEAK OU IN ONE OF MY VERY FAVORITE GESTURES IN THE ENCYCLOPEDIA A HUMAN GESTURES THE BOOK OF DELIGHTS IS A SERIES OF DAILY SNAP SHOTS INTO ONE MAN'S HABITS AND PLEASURES IF YOU EVER WANTED AN ESSAY ABOUT THE SPECIFIC SENSATION OF A PLYING COKENON OIL TO A SHOWER DAMP BODY THAT WOULD BE DELIGHT NUMBER ONEON ONE EPORTS AN THE PEOPLE ROSS ENCOUNTERS IN THEM COME AP POTEDIT HIS GARDEN WILL BE SPENT A VERY DELIGHTFUL AFTERNOON TOOKING ABOUT BUMBLE BEES AND POTATOES IS THE LOCATION OF MANY A DELIGHT SOME OF THE DELIGHTS IN THE BOOK WERE THINGS THAT SURPRISED HIM WHILE OTHERS WERE LOOKING BACK IN TIME MEMORIES OF PEOPLE NO LONGER HERE A LOT OF THEM FEATURED FAMILIAR FACES IND FAMILIAR PLACES ROSS WAS GETTING TO REASSESS HIS ENVIRONMENT AND CONSIDER IT THROUH RENEW LENDS A DELIGHTFUL LINS I WAS LEARNING AS I'S GOING AND FRANKLY S PRI LEARNING HOW MY SOB THESE THINGS DELIGHTED ME THE QUESTION IS ALWAYS WISE I DELIGHTLY WHAT DOES IT DO TO A PERSON TO STUDY DELIGHT OR AS IT INMURGES TO STUDY JOY EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR A YEAR WHAT DO YOU DISCOVER ONE OF THE THINGS HE DISCOVERED IS THE MECHANICS OF HOW TO FINED DELIGHT EVERY DAY AS A DISCIPLINE BECAUSE DELIGHT DOESN'T JUST ARIVE YOU NEEDS TO ACTIVELY GOOD LOOKING FOR IT BEIT IT IN A STATE OV AH THI TRY TO TRAIN YOUR CURIOSITY E TRY TO TRAIN THE SENSE OF THAT KNOING DELIGHT CURIOSITY A REALLY TIED OUT LIKE YOU HAVE TO BE O KAY WITH THAT KNOWING THINGS YOU HAVE TO BE ACTUALLY INVESTED AND HAPPY ABOUT NAT KNOWING THINGS THE BOOK OF DELIGHTS IS A PECULIAR THING AN UNDERTAKING OF SERIOUS ECADEMIC RIGUR AT ALSO MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD THOSE THINGS OT MEANT TO GO TOGETHER THE BOOK OFFERS UP MANY SORTS ON WHAT DELIGHTES OR WHAT IT COULD BE BUT IT NEVER DEFINDS IT EXPLICITLY THE TAKE AWAY IS THAT DELIGHT WHILE IMPORTANTE IS HARD TO PIN DOWN READING THE BOOK AND TOKING TO ROSS ABOUT THIS MAKE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS FLOATING ON A CHEMICALLY ENHANCED BUT PERFECTLY LEGAL IN ELEVEN STATES CLOUD I BEGAN TO THINK OF HIM AS A SORT OF PERSONAL DELIGHT TO AND SO MY QUESTIONS FOR HIM BEGAN TO TAKE ON THE STRONG WIFT OF A PETULI JUSTING DID YOU END UP WITH A GRAND UNIFYING THEORY ON WHAT DELIGHT IS NO A NO BUT I DID AND THAT WHIH WHAT FEELS LIKE A KIND OF BEGINNING IN THEORY OF WHAT JOYS AND LI I DUST ATTIV AND DELIGHT IS LIKE THEIR BUTTERFLIES FLIED AROUND AND LANDING ON THE THING THAT IS JO RIGHT SEE PETULIN TO ROSS AN IMPORTANT PART OF DELIGHT IS THAT IT'S AN INVITATION BY LOVING SOMETHING WE ALLOW OTHER PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOVE IT TOO SHARING TAPPING SOME ONE ON THE SHOULDER TO SAY HEY LOOK SO OFTEN I FEEL LIKE I'VE HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF WALKING THROUGH THE WORLD AND THAT SAYING YTHING IN THAT SOMWARS LIKE DID YOU SEE HOW THAT YOU

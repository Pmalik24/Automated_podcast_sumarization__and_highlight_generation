OF LIFE LANE'S APPROACH TO MAKING MAKE INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IS BAS ON AF PROGRESSIVE FAIRLY NEW MANAGEMENT THEORY DESIGNED TO CURB LALL THI SORGANSATIONS IT'S ESSENTIALLY DRAW HARD BOUNDARIES MAKE NO CONCESSIONS BE CONSISTENT ON RELENTING AND INTEND TO FIFTEEN YEARS MAY BE THEY'LL BE A REAL SHIFT IT'S ARDUOUS THE BEGINNING IS THE HARDEST PART THIS APPROACH MADE A LOT OF SENSE TO LAHN BECAUSE OF HIS EXPERIENCE ON THE AMPSER DOWN POLICE FORCE HE HELPED CLEAN UP AND REFORM THE DEPARTMENT AS AE RORKY COP HE 'D SEEN THE PROBLEMS FIRST HAND HE STARTED IN A CORRUPT PRESINCT THE RED LIGKT DISTRICT IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES HE SAYS COPS STOLE SOLD DROGS WERE EXCESSIVELY VILENT CHANGING THAT MEANT RIGOROUSLY ENFORCING RULES RITING UP BAD COPS DISCIPLINING THEM FIRING THEM LANES AS IT TOOK ABOUT TEN YEARS FOR THE RULES TO BE ACCEPTED AS NORMAL BUT THIS CONFRONTATIONAL APPROACHES NOT THE WAY THINGS USUALLY WORK IN THE NETHERLANDS SRUI NAT WE KNOW THE DUTCHELTREIS VERY MUCH EVERYTHING PEASE EVERYTHING TOGETHER NO CONFLECT ND WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TO CONDIS TRADITIONAL RECIPE IS TALKING TALKING TALKING NOT  BUT NOT THE DUTCH HAVE THIS TERM PULDER MADAL THE TAKE PRIDE IN IT THE IDEA IS TO BRING EVERYONE TOGETHER DESPITE THEIR DIFFERENCES JUST LIKE THEIR ANCESTORS CAME TO GATHER TO BUILD DYKES AND DAMPS TO PROTECT THEIR LAND FROM THE SEE HIS STORINS DEBATE WHETHER THAT' SACTUALLY TRUBUT ANYWAY EVERYONE FROM PARLIAMENT TO THE LOCAL AMATEUR SOCKER CLUB TRIES TO MAKE DECISIONS THIS WAY THROUGH DISCUSSIONS AND CONSENSES LANE DID DABBLE AND PULDER MADAL A LITTLE IN THE BEGINNING HE SPENT HIS FIRST SIX MONTHS GOING TO FIRE STATIONS TRYING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT DIVERSITY WOULD MAKE THEM A STRONGER FIRE DEPARTMENT IN THE CITY WITH ALMOST A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NATIONALITIES AND THAT WOMEN BRING PRAGMATISM IN EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE TO THE BRIGADE BUT LANE WAS ALMOST ALWAYS MET WITH BLANK STAIRS GUYS TOLD HIM WEMEN AREN'T STRONG ENOUGH FOR THIS JOB ONE OF THEM SAID HE JUST WEN AN EXCUSE TO BRING IN A HUNDRED BROAD AGAIN HEREIS LNE TI FOR HALFALE IS IN THE SCRUCYOFOR DEFICIEN I INTELLECTO IS BONNICALBA INTELLECTUALLYWAS ONHARD TO HAV THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT DIVERSITY AND I DON'SON ON CRASS AND I DON'T WANT TO BE UN KIND ABOUT MY PEOPLE BUT SOME OF THEM OR KIND OF TO STUPID TO KEEP HAVING THIS DIVERSITY CONVERSATION AND IN INS IN THAT WAY IN I SOME POINT CNDI JUST HAVE TO SAY TOGIN A STOLP TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS GOING TO DO IT IN WO ITOITHIS WIUKNOW THIS IS AN ORGANIZATION IT'S NOT  SOME KIND OF DEMOCRATIC WO BY ASSING WE ONG AND A TALK ABOUT IN N JORITY ROS HOU CAN TAKE IT OR LEVEN HE WAS DON REASONING WITH THEM HE DIDN'T HAVE TO AFTER ALL HE HAD THE FULL SUPPORT OF MYOR EVER HEART FONDERLON HE WAS WILDLY POPULAR THE CITY ADORED HIM HE SNOBED TO FLOT OF MARE PUDENT WHEN HE WAS IN TOWN BECAUSE THE RUSSIAN LEADERS ANTIOGY  TIOS THE CITY COUNSEL BACK THE MAYOR AND HE BAPPED LANE WHICH MEANT BUT THE MAYOR SUPPORT LANE COULD DO WHATEVER HE WANTED EN HE HAD A BIG IDEA FOR HOW TO GET THE KIND OF COUNTABILITY H WANTED IN E FIRE  COMING OUT IN THIS PON PEOPLE HE CAN THREATEN THEIR JOBS WHEN OSFALS TIA TALK SO THIT'S IN A MINUTE CHICAGO BOBOCEDIO WENT OUR PROGRAMM CONTINUES IT'S IS MARC ON MI FROM MOR GLASS TO DAY SHO BURN IT DOWN WE HAVE TWO STORIES OF PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE IT IS TIME TO BURN EVERYTHING DOWN MAKE ENEMIES DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE WHO IN THE MIDDLE BACKED ONE A POLICEMAN BURNS DOWN A FIRE HOUSE JOENNI CA KISS IS IN THE FACT IS REPUTTING ON THE AMSTERDAM FIRE DEPARTMENT THE RESISTANCE CHANGED FROM INSIDE THE DEPARTMENT AND IN THIS HALF OF HER STORY HAW THE BIGGER POLITICS TO THE CITY START TO SHIFT EVERYTHING QUICK PO GRENDA BEFORE WE STOOD T SECOND HALF OF THIS A JOENA DISCOVERED WHEN SHE STUD A LOOKING INTO THIS STORY THAT THE FIRE COMMANDER'S PARTNER HO'S A JOURNALIST TE SOMEBODY OF JOANNAS WORKED WITHIN THE PAST JOENNA HAS NOT DISCUSSED THE CONTENT OF THES STORY WITH THIS JOURNALIST THE JOURNALIST WAS NOT INBOLVED IN THI STORY IN ANY WAY AGAIN HERS JOAN LANE HAD DEVISED THE VERY UNUSUAL PLAN BUT TO PULL IT OFF HE HAPP TONLEST THE MAYOR HE DID SOMETHING THAT I VARILY SEEIN ANY PUBLIC OFICIAL DO HE TOOK ALL HIS CRITICISMS ABOUT HIS OWN FIRE DEPARTMENT AND MADE THEM PUBLIC AND BY DOING SO HE MADE HIMSELF THE BIGGEST CRITIC AOF SOME OF THE MOST BELOVED FIGURES AN AMSTERDAM IMAGINE THE HEAD OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IN NEW YORK OR CHICAGO PUBLISHING A LONG LIST OF ALL ABOUT STUFF THE ARE OFFICERS HAD DONE IT WOULD BLOW UP IN THEIR FACES THAT DID NOT HAPPEN THE LANE HERE IS HOW HE WENT ABOUT IT HE STARTED BY WRITING A SINGLE LETTER TO THE MAYOR DETAILING HIS FINDINGS ABOUT DISCRIMINATION IN BULLING AT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT DID ISNON THE HOMEMINE DAY OF DON'T E AND AS ITSOLATION AS E READ THE LETTER AN  THEN THERE WAS A CERTAIN SURPRISE BECAUS I THINK HE LITERALLY SAID I THOUGHT THERE WERE ALL CONTETINGS GOING ON BAT IT TURNS OUT THERE WAS EVEN MORE GOING ON THAN I THOUGHT BUT NOW I AX WE HAVE THE PROOF ND NOW WEREGING TO WORK ON THIS TOGETHER AND OJI ASHAMADA FOR THE IN RESPONSE THE MAYOR WROTE HIS OWN LETTER BLASTING THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND SENT IT WITH LANES TO THE CITY COUNCIL MAKING THEM PUBLIC RECORD REPORTERS POUNCED I DID DID YOU IN THE MAYOR THAT DID THE TO YOU TALK ABOUTED I SERT OF A STRATEGY YA YA IT'S USH IT'S USH USLY EA MIGHTY DAY MY AND I  OVERLIK THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY MY IDEA AND I KNEW IT WAS GIN AND UP I EMEDIAT I KNEW THISIN I MAKE THE PAPERS OVERSO THAT WAS SOMETHING IN A THOUGHT I BEFORE  THAT IF I WRITE THIS LETTER THERE'S GOING TO BE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TRESSURES THAT I WOULD GET THE MUNISIP COUNSIL AND ALSO THE PUBLIC TO SEE THAT SOMETHING NEEDED TO BE DONE AND ANFULLY DIN DO  BEVUST THERLL HA POCOSIO OM HEELI A MADIA THE  TILL TTHIS WAS VERY VERY CALCULATED EVEN TO THE POINT WHERE I DID YUSE WORDS THAT HEY KNEW THE MEDIUM WI YOU HOUNCE ON IFD YOU GET IN DISCUSSION GOING BUT WHAT THE PRUSISON THIS CREE ME TAT THRACE IS IN MY DISCRIMINATION THOSLY ANIM ABOUT LUSIN CONSLEES AR TERMS THAT I KNOW AR GOING TO GET PEOPLE'S ATTENTION IT'S REALLY UNUSUAL FOR I'M A PUBLIC OFFICIAL TO DU SOMETHING LIKE THIS THA THAT U SHOT SHOW MA DAD WOULD HASE O O WELL EFFECT YES IT IS EXTREMELY UNUSUALLY IT MAKES IT VERY EFFENIS AND I LOOKED AT WHAT FORMER FIRE COMMANDERS DID AND IE FELT THAT TIT DIDN'T OU USE A MOSTABILITIES THEY HAD ENOUGH AND I THE CONSCIOUSLY DECIDED I'M GON MAKE MORE IF BEAND THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR HANDS DURNING AND YOU HAVE TO GO PUBLIC DO YOU REMEMBER ANY DISCUSSION YOU HAD WITH THE MAYOR OR WITH ANY ONE ELSE WHO WAS LESS SURE THAT THIS WAS THE RIGHT WAY AND YAH YAH OKEA I GI  BUT BUT TE BUT TH  SPURI  IN MY OLD SATING IS CONCT WHEN I NOTICED IN AND WHICH PEOPLE AROUND ME WAS MUST BE FERE AND SO THAT WICH A LOT OF THE PEOP WE MANAGEMENT HERE THE SAWORDED ME THAT THEY WERE KIND OF REDICENTE ME TO SA NEW THIS KIND OF ORGANIZATION IF YOU GO LOOKING FOR A FIGHT HEARE GOING TO GET A FIGHT DID THE MAYOR EVER HAVE ANY RESERVATIONS ABOUT THIS IS A STRATEGY LOK ONSICONS THE DETAILS IN LANE'S REPORT LANDED ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE MAIN NEWSPAPER AND AMSTERDAM THEN THE MAYOR AN LANE WENT ON A MEDIO LETS HERE'S LANE ON A RADIO SHELL FLINGING OPEN THE DOORS ON WHAT REALLY GOES ON INSIDE A FIRE HOUSE THE HOST OF THE PROGRAMES HAS TO LANE SO WHAT YOU FOUND WAS A VERY MACH OF CULTURE I YOU EN HE GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLES OF THAT ALL SHU ALL SO MUT A COLSE ON GOLAY HO CAFULSE WHAT IF YOU'RE SITTING AT A TABLE IN YOUR MAROCC AND AND SOMETHING COMES ON TO VE ABOUT HIS LAM THAN PEOPLE START TALKING ABOUT THOSE CANTS FOR MARACKINS AND WHEN YOU'RE SITTING THERE AS A SERIOUS PROFESSIONAL FIRE FIGHTER IT HAS AN EFFECT ON YOU AND THEN OF COURSE YOU ERE THE EXCEPTION LIKE HA WE DON'T MEAN YOU IT'S THOSE

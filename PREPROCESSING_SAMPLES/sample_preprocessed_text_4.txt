From w b easy chicago it is this american life i am nancy updike filling in for ira glass ti da show is a rerun a good on and i am gin a start with this story that i want a share it is little personal i was at MAC the make up store not the computers store and i was buying foundation which i almost never wear it is the make up you put all over your face to give yourself the pretend perfect skin and i asked the salesman for help finding the right color and he looked at me and he said almost you was thinking out loud he said your neck it is much more yellow than your face and then he turned away to start looking for the impossible color that would solve this problem of the yellow wriht next to the much more yellow and if you are thinking all this was just a sale's technique to invent a PROBLEM and then offerd to fix it with more products i wish that that had been the case but this was not an upsell this was a cree to cur the man really just seemed to be expressing his frustration at this stumper of my mismatched face and neck a a this sort of out of the blue perfectly sharpend comment stops wo cold because it is not an insult it is an observation that is true you just had not thought of it before it is shocking because you think i know myself i know what have got what i haven got no one's can a spot something about me that i have not already seen not true you can be among friends doing something you love feeling grat we WER' backage and I'LL getty RAY to go on preparing this is do watson she was in a play a while back and with all black women we were all come of a a of

here to say anything ye i think he thought i would thank that wuth muneyi i did not ha nm these are not statements that human being forgets the moment you hear the observation it becomes part of how you see yourself seemingly for ever even something tiny if it hits you rit can turn into this chirpy little voice mall that your brain is never able to arase and it does not have to be bout looks it can be a comment on how you run bor laugh or drive how much money you make what books you have read or have not read any outside a sessment of you that you never saw coming and could not shake once it

people facing the unexpected moment of realizing how other people see them what that means and what in god's name to do about it to days show is that what i look prepared to learn the truth what e special guest appearance that will surpri is and elight ye stayment at at DWIN in forest did men go my tenas has this story abat a vision in BROWNSVILLE taxas hes to mane ot when i was sixteen i realized as far as my family went school was considered my time which meant i could not be pressed into labor by my father or grandmother they were farm workers and they made no claim on my time when i was supposed to be in school i learned to take advantage of this i would make it to school before seven thirty a m either by school bus or my mother's torrents and then WAIGHED out options for escape by my sophomore er this kidnade tony garcia had BECOME MY PRIMARY FRIEND tony was nearly nineteen and only a junior but he did not seem all that bad because he had good parents and an even better little brother who was about to lap him mat graduation together tony and i would find ways to while away the hours by doing anything othed than attending class before we had to report home again we were big fans of HUCKLEBERY FIN and TOM SAWYER and we believed we were continuing he long celebrated american tradition by ditching class and getting stone a FACTO see combination of mark TWAIN and HUNTHER AS tomson but really we were just lazy in looking for a good tints the skipping itself was not a PROBLEM the problem was taking care of our grads and absences on our report cards before they reached our PARENT and it was actually tony wo iniciated me into the trade that i eventually pursued graphic design but in this early stage in high school it was plain and simple forgery thit was no design on what we were doing it was tony who placed the FIRST exact when iif i ever held in my hands and immediately i felt an overwhelming sense of possibility holding that little penknife we would intercupt the report cards when the came in the mail and then tony took careful pains to explain this whole process to me his flunkey a term that came uncomfortably close to becoming literal over the photocopyr in the library feting dimes into the machine he was playing slots in search of a COPY that did not blur or show the incisions in the original look man he said through his trendy an tento john ledonglasses o bancarstyle even then you just got to remove the TWO from the twenty three absences and then lighten the REPRODUCTION and now he got THREE absences in FIRST period instead of TWENTY THREE now take the eight from the FORTY eight move the fore over and but the EIGHT in front of that and now i have obedience spanish instead of a neaf oh i said in total understanding a big smile growing on my face give hem mat arrive he skipes for a day teach him how to forge it was ridiculously short sight ad shorer but at that age i never thought further than the immediate threat simply convincing my mother everything was quiet at school was enough for me dealing with school records in the larger consequences of robbing myself of even a substandard education all that i would face at a litter day and certainly hav tony would usually borrow his mother's car for our expedition a blue olzmobile delta EIGHTY EIGHT we leave school and drive the south podry island i resort town at the end of a twenty eight mile highway i felt much more cosmopolitan the BRONZWILL texas ever CUD we did that drive back and forth THREE or four times a day listening to led zeplen nodding our heads in UNISON with WHOMEVER else was STONE ter dro TON the car my juniorior and his seniorior tony's parents by him a dogeday tonent it was a year he woul most assuredly graduate they felt and it was a chance for him to developed responsibility in the mornings the menate my mother would drop me off at school and disappear round the corner tony would drive around in park rig in front of the school to pick me up right in front of everybody tjude you got a come skipping with me to day he would say but on ONE particular morning late n nineteen eighty eight i balk now TONY i got to go back to glass to day i protest it is thursday and i have not been since LAST WEEK look he says i got TWO sundary entry slips i can get you back in to morrow or NEXT WEEK it is not a PROBLEM and i foughd a new place to get killer weed finding pot was always the problem when TONY said he founds of ONE new and it was not one of the morons who hung out by THE TENES CORTS BEFORE SCHOOL i was entret we first drive to a housing project east to school were a woman sold TWO doughter ports of budwiser out of her living room from a cooler to any one with mone no questions asked we buy a couple of quarts and smoke the last half joint tony has on the way to his new killer weats of car i was getting a bit high whend i began to recognized the rout he was taking and was in thoroughly taken e back when he drove right into my grandmother's driveway i could not understand why it just did not make sense this was the same driveway my family pontiac would regularly polinto after church on SUNDAYS when i was growing up in the late nineteen seventies my mother's mother's HOUSE and downtown BRONSVILLE i was i think the term is UN nerved my TWO uncles johnny and able were working on a seveny nine tomero when TONY trives up an pars hood to hood with their car the hood was up andthey were both leaning into the guts of the engine theire heads popped up bearded byker prairie dogs i sat frozen in the passenger seat uncertain what to do nex tony noticing that i was startled tolds me to be cool to chill out these gos lookd mean but there all right anyways he says as his getting out of the driver side ther kind of dumb but they got great weed did not i know it tabel and johnny had a long history with local biker gangs even a rumored affiliation with the hills angels they could get drugs nobody else could in this town and as a result they were total burn outs hardly capable of cogan speech patterns in either english or spanish they landed and jail as often as other people thattended church but what they lacked in brains they certainly made up and brown not that they tearer part of tenager tonyer me not in the daylight anyway they had a coed about that sort of thing but if they felt cheated they have taken a tire iron to my head long before they recognized me as her nephew they were that burned out i sit there paralyzed in the front seat side b of houses of the holy playing on TONY's caset day i because it is hot the a c is blasting whnce tony closes the DOOR i cannot hear anything i just watch as his terrifying panto mine plays out before me tony half shaven in his prepy clothes closes the DOOR in hales is greeting my uncle abele already brain dead from years o sniffing paint narrows his eyes aind suspicion and then noiselessly responds with the nodding hey tony averts on contact looking anywhere but directly at abele for fear that able my charg a garilla tabl gives om a SUSPICIOUS QUICK UPWARD jut of the chin that says did i sill to you before who told you i got weed tony lowers his head in quiet confidence talking to able then my uncle johnny noch towards me in the car says something to tony they all turned to look at me my eyes go wide a big smile on my face nodding tony says something and then they all laughed together let zepplan still plays loudly in the car then my uncle abel slaps TONY on the back and theads him around of the back of te car right where i am johnny stands there too looking at me in smile ing makes his inexs finger and thumb into a mock roach and LAUGHS I'M emic the roach back even now he does not recognize me then TONY and able emerge around the other side of the car with TONY's hand in his pocket and both of them are laughing your suddenly old friends tony turns an waves and both JOHNNY and able wafe back the DOOR opens and TONY says dude we got a big joint for TWO boxs as he gets in the driver's seat this his freek to be out to no and able an johnny are both waving making the universal roach smoking signal as we drive off and it leaves me feeling really really conflicted the car slips up the southernd most terminous the highway seventy seven and we had north from urban brownswell to drive around as we smoke the joint tony lights it and it starts burning purple purple hayes he says and then follows thit with his characteristic h hame as sir a kind of scared about socuers i have never seen when burnd as CO AH dude says tonin do not worry aboud those gi's got killer weed man they bikers ar something it is probably laced with someing that is why it was TWO boxs this idea sounds appeeling to tony it scares a out of me we are both getting in credibly high hayman says TONY would not it be mestop if wen you were high your hair went into a huge arage afro and the higher you were the bigger your afro got you cannot go anywhere because people would be man that GIT stoned i sit there an TONY's car and think about my uncle's johnny enabl TONY had been stabbed in the back with the flathead ed screwdriver about a month earlier in a street fight his long had been punctured and my grandmother said you could hear whistling every time he enhaled he would not go to the hospital to get a treated for THREE DAYS WE'RE HALFWAY done with the joint when i say to tony hayman i do not want to get stoned any more ar well put it out TONY says nodding his head back and forth tos upland TONY's looft haund his fingerind cords into the neck of an imaginary guitar as he driving i watch his fingers move for a few seconds suspended and twisting a round there and overturned keen crad and i can find no correlation with the cords in SIN man i mean i do not want to smoke pot any more i say to him i do not want to skip class any more it want to get back to school not to day but in general i do not want to feel this any more i am doing something bad i feel this all the time now dirty look at that REALLY small house over there we were on an over pass and i just noticed a HOUSE beneath US on the BROWNSEL country club about a quarter o the sizes of the houses surrounding it tony starts laughing hard o have to make a FOCUS BACK ON THE DRIVING but then i laugh along with hi you'r stoned he tells me yah i say i am awaystoned oh hayman i say a little later we are driving back to south poder iland now those guyes we bought weet from EARLIER TO DAY the bikers tony says that was my grandmother's HOUSE man those are my uncles i say even though ia really embarrassed by it tony finds his be fuddling he cannot figere out with the bikers were doing at my GRANDMOTHER'S house those dudes were my mom's brothers man my uncles i explain tony is laughing hard he hasd to pull over to the side of the road his laughing is infectious and i find myself laughing right along with him laughing harder that i have laughin a really really long time but i am feeling utterly beyond redemption on the inside i just dun something to day that i could not take back mi course was now SET e WTO mingle martinas reading has story from his memoir the boy kings of TEXAS N act to not my FIRST time at the rudio parents and children are life long mirrors for each other how do you see me how do ies see myself through my relationship with you even when you are not face to face with ONE of your parents theire conversations between you that play back in your head your whole life what they said what you said sometimes you repeat those conversations to explain to someone else or to yourself who you are or who your parents are but what if you could rehere the actual dialogue decates leater not your memory of it but the words that were truly spoken between you and apparent while back i did a story about some one who got that exact chance bill lay he was in his early twenties and ON THE PHONE with his father in nineteen seventy eight when he heard a faint pinging sound on the PHONE he mentioned it and his father said an meter or r r r eer u ER TWO DECADES LATER after his father had died bill was at his dad's HOUSE in ohio cleaning out the office and i open up a fill cabtan and found thirty our forty coset tapes with his unmistakable hand written otations of NAMES and dates and and i knew instantly what they were but he had been a surptitiously teaping US even at the time his father was recording bill had guessed what could be going on it was the kind of thing his father might do and he did he recorded hours of calls with bill and according to his own handwritten labels he also tape his FOUR other children his wife his mother other relatives his priest he recorded calls at home and in the car th o or r o o from the dates on the casettes bill figured they were in arkive wif his father trying to get the people around him on to his side bill's mother had left his father after thirty seven years of marriage bill remembered the jist and tone of those conversations pretty well they were memorable and he put off listening to the recordings of them for twelve years they sat in a BLACK NILON deffle bag that he would move every time the family moved this was a pile of information bill was not sure he wanted from an era of his life he knew he did not wanto re live he cided with his mam in the divorce even before the divorce since junior hige he would been lobbying her to leave his dad as bill saw his father he was smare tenacious and a tremendous bully with a bad quick temper and huge blow ups he got worse over TIME and he is worse when he drank what bill remembered from the taped conversations were long calls where his father bullied him and he fought back hard he saw himself as his mother's advocate and protector i remember him trin a RECRUIT me in his campaign and keep thehis marriage together and and my a memory was i me saying versions of tet she osn't want to do that any more you gies have tried for long time a let it go in some FIRST on huf face facts it is over you remember pushing back verbally arguing with him ye ye all the time ado those twelve years of holding on to the TAPES bill finally reached just about the age his father had been when he made the RECORDINGS and suddenly BILL WANTED TO HEAR THEM he feltready but NERVOUS here was ra dad about what i actually did in conversations with my TAD and i just took one of the types with me his my name on it and when into our car in the back of our house partially cause it was the only place that had a caset taper carter that i knew of and the first thing came on was his voice iapretty agrassively question any me about something and his voice was as clear as the day i heard it she can betn ER in you yo san i ted want e ti sag e r er i e r his father was talking about the fact that bill and his for sibblings all sided with their mother in a divorce in ONE way or another o whe

really intense i but took at the tape out went back and went into the HOUSE told my wife about it and thidn't listened to them again for i dontn three formonths when BILL WENT BACK TO listening for real whet he heard was his father pushing one main point with him hour after hour which was how about you talking your mother into trying again what d you feel about that i susmu ever ye ar r ha r er

me where was the stand up person that was willing to call a li a lie a a we know willing to draw bright lines and say i am not whel i am not a will not even put up with a communal having a conversation about this and some of these conversations go on long a me forty FIVE MINUTES an hour i just hammering away at you i mi and at the points he is making why did you stay on ISUCH a long time wi why not to say dout agot ago ye now i om i i man i was always living wis consin during me lot of this taping i felt badly that my mom was back there would basically by yeurself dealing with HIM and and i think i had some notion that by staying on the fon with him in a sika little bit of te rodio clown in other h old rodio clowns would be sent out the the cowboy would be buff off THE BOLL SEND a distant wo discot the bo go out to distract the boll il was not crussed by the difference between when he hurried and the TAPES and the tough line he would remembered taking his dad that it did throwin off balance he really had seen himself from the time he was a kid as a warrior standing up to the stron detecting the weed a sort of superhere when it came to arguing against his dad but i was less heroic oas i i was more pragmatic it was less of an appect struggle of right and wrong and more mondane than that i mean what kid fanticize US about being a pragmentist i oh bill says his mother thrived after the divorce his father he says stayed MORE OR LESS THE SAME he married again divorced again bill kept up a relationship with him his whole life that had been his other goal during these calls besides protecting his mam not losing his dad he had thought about that even during the worst arguments thetter a long silence than words he could not take back ill saw his father once or twice a year every year after the divorce and he spoke to him by fum every few weeks sunce we died r r r coming up what the movy the breakfast club can teach you about parenting if you were in the breakfast club that is in a minute from chicago public radio when our programm continues it is this american life i am nancy updike sitting in for ir a glass every week we choose a theme that and we PRESENT VARIOUS stories on that theme to days show is that what i look stories of seeing yourself through other people's eyes whether you want TWO or not and were here at AT THREE which i think i's going to come f TWO parter at THREE bend you wone to do that part sor athry the blunder years i am talking to ben calhoun ONE of the producers here and he is got a small story he is embarrassed to tell it but i am making him ben ye take us back EIGHTH grade eighth grate and i should just say i played tuba i was small that was me and DEFINITELY zero attention from the girls and roosevelt middle school i had this teacher though who her name was a miss savage she was the chool teacher a bet ye she was younger than pretty much every teacher in the school she was into janes a diction and she was the the the ROCKIN rold teacher and all of the kid sort of idilized her can we are going in a g p g direction with this rate just e ok at yeum tinue there was just is ONE DAY when i am just standing in the class room and thit was it was a crowd of girls that were standing around miss savage and and a i do not i have no idea what they were talking about and miss savage is saying something and then out of the blue it says it she points to me i am staying i the other side of the room and she says it look out for that ben calhoun he is going to be a heartbreaker and did the girls turn and look it was a crowd of faces hivited satelites and looked at me and i was just i do not i do not totally know what happened but but it feels maybe my life might have chane just brit deh and you mean what legetet YAN'T yet yet did the girls com a start to notice one girl in particular that is what you neen ye and that really can be all you need to change your life when your tea nature just ONE person who thinks your great because chances are your own sense of yourself is way off the friend of a FRIEND this is a woman in her fifties came across an old photo of herself as a tea nature and it had been YEARS since she would seen any pictures of herself at that age and she looked at them and thought oh wait i was pretty i was pretty it kind of floreder because of course the girl in the pictures looked nothing the way she thought of herself at the time she said she wished she would known it back then at WOULDHAVE made a difference lots of US have had that experience looking at old family pictures or your books seeing things we never saw at the TIME this next story is a very specialized case of that kind of thing it is about THE ACTRESS MOLLY RINGWALD who of course does not just have photos but movies beautifully shot wide screen full length holly woud films of herself as a tea nature she is the red head the star in those three iconic eightye's movies by JOHN hughs pretty and pink sixteen candles in the breakfast club recently she revisited one of those movies not exactly by choice and she talked to ire glass here is ivra i SUPPOSE is non a big surprise that mally ringwald does not sit around watching old maly ringwald films in a shes seen him she nees a big reason to go back to them i recently her daughter gave her a reason her daughter matilda is TEN and matilda wanted to see the breakfast club crist ten as little young to se the breakfast club but muster her friends had seen it it was kind of weird that she was the only one that had not seen this moving and a she said that it was a conversation at slumber parties where that is a movy that some kids want a watch and that she had ALWAYS said pletlet ada want a watchet can we watch something else because she wanter to watch it with me i toi that was shurly nice i wonder if it is if it is she once to watch it with you that is a nice thing to say to your mam bbbut but the the truth could also se she just does not want to watch it with tham yn i meang iai can you imagine SWATCHING YOUR MAM WITH A GROUP OF YOUR FRIENDS yand you have no idea what is about to happen yah i didnaneven really think about that but ye i am sure that had something to do with it matilda does not not surprises a the fact is mally ringwill preferred TO WATCH IT WITH matilda it just see mik it might be a nice experience to share together n the we things in the film that she knew that she was going to want to talk to matilda about for instance there is a scene where she smokes pot in the film as a tea nature molly showed her the breakfast club not sure it all how she was gon to react not sure what it would be to see the film through matilda's eyes wesin er a tapercorter to record what happen e which by the way matida loved the TAPPRCUORTER eso sheu ave talking in to the tapegrisho oud answering questions though she is not can hear this readya story for a long time that is the plan the beakfast club if you have never seen it is FIVE kids ther stuck together in school on a saturday for all days to tention ther kids who never would normaay talk to each other in school it is a jock a brain a tough kid a popular girl and an outside er girl and it s john hues mabe the bond talking about all these things that everybody feels in high school and you can totalwys see white still gets to kids and white's the john huesfilm that mlly ringwald looks back on that is her favorite she ma tood u they make popcorn they fit is sroun with tt and you do not stars are just thus they do not know how to operate the vidio systems either they can not figure at hout to turn it on and is a ddh d m i t m on i dely m i IM it sounds really silly i mean it it is it is it was almost a date i were you just you just want everything to go oqet yow i did not want her to i did not want her to not it i WY did not want her ti get bored o get wi i OP  YO  YWHAT S YO any point dering the fim wer you had SECOND out s about at without thout watching it with her YUTHAT the sex stuff i was i was a little a i was crincing how you little bit r you meticre fretu ors psyrchological i did not mean a tat wa you go sopety worsh in my mout there is a whole part whereveryone saying did you do it did yhou do it why just answer the question you nobody answer as o the questio wer tolt to that i am thinking just can ask me what are they talking about but then she just did not ask it was she was not all of that stuff she just did not want to know and i was trying to sort of ask her what she got out of that what she thought we were talking about but trying to ask her in such a way where i would not tell her where i would not end at talkintout sex if she did not know all all the talk about did she do it did she not do it all of that stuff kind as wtho the what tho par well they were did did you do it did you do it clare just answer the question i answer the question wa wish fa the wa and my husband sitting there looking at me just stop sto she does not get it this is the FIRST time that you saw the film as a parent did you see it differently absolutely i i really did i lay i really kind of felt for the parents for people have not se THE BEAKFAST CLUB A LOT OF IT is about the kids being disappointed in the parents y and how alone and isolated and frustrated you feel with your parents and now i see the movin and i just i think their poor parents and and i think that when it was pointed out to me that tthat the movy just talks about how all parents socking i then i thought in my mind well actually thout that might be kind of good because then she can see that that she does not have parents that and then she can appreciat and but that can go another way ye that was my focas i guess a case afterwards you are talking to her about the film an theres this moment that gets surprisingly emotional and only po you that which character when when the characters talk and you think oh that is what i feel are there anyting that you say THEAT that is what i feel gus solit a bit o is he li brinor something ye ye bran i should say is the straigt a student whose parents pressure him to get good grates puid by etherty michael hall you can theling frin you do he is REALLY sweesnt ano a kind sometimes finish you means wa you think i i re thee well really no no no tol me tell me oh e no w s nono sweety it is c it is ka IM I'M JUST I'M just surprised ou a just just fairly a little bit er o ca youkno that is really justme to know i no intea when did i make you feel th i o ar ied better oh because i i said that i wish i did better i you wanted me to do i am sorry i mane you feel that way very dary do you rememberd the things she is talking about of you saying toher oh i wish that i had done better in school i was really surprised i was not expecting that at all i am and the only thing that i can think of really is we have this home work battle and it is incredibly frustrating and it is for standin to get her to do the work it is yah it because it is really easy i mean and i not to saying that asn'nt adult i mean it is easy she did to work for her it is easy work for her if she would just sit down do it it would it would take fifteen minutes twenty minutes ah but she resents the fact that she has to do it much and it it became such a battle that she would sort of lie sprawled out kind of barely write you could not even read her writing and i would just get frustrated with her and and i would yellat her and say ou know you can do better than aster smartinas sin all the things the

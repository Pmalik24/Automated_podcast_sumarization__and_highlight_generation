asked the salesman for help finding the right color and he looked at me and he said almost you was thinking out loud he said your neck it is much more yellow than your face and then he turned away to start looking for the impossible color that would solve this problem of the yellow wrist next to the much more yellow and if you are thinking all this was just a sale's technique to invent a problem and then offer to fix it with more products i wish that that had been the case but this was not an upswell this was a free to cur the man really just seemed to be expressing his frustration at this stumper of my mismatched face and neck a a this sort of out of the blue perfectly sharpen comment stops wo cold because it is not an insult it is an observation that is true you just had not thought

the unexpected moment of realizing how other people see them what that means and what in god's name to do about it to days show is that what i look prepared to learn the truth what e special guest appearance that will surprise is and light ye statement at at win in forest did men go my tens has this story bat a vision in brownsville taxes hes to mane to when i was sixteen i realized as far as my family went school was considered my time which meant i could not be pressed into labor by my father or grandmother they were farm workers and they made no claim on my time when i was supposed to be in school i learned to take advantage of this it'd make it to school before seven thirty a m either by school bus or my mother's torrents and then weighed out options for escape by my sophomore er this kidnap tony garlic had become my primary friend tony was nearly nineteen and only a junior but he did not seem all that bad because he had good parents and an even better little brother who was about to lap him mat graduation together tony and i would find ways to while away the hours by doing anything other than attending class before we had to report home again we were big fans of huckleberry fin and tom sawyer and we believed we were continuing he long celebrated america tradition by ditching class and getting stone a fact see combination of mark twain and hunter as common but really we were just lazy in looking for a good tints the skipping itself was not a problem the problem was taking care of our grads and absences on our report cards before they reached our parent and it was actually tony wo initiated me into the trade that i eventually pursued graphic design but in this early stage in high school it was plain and simple forgery that was no design on what we were doing it was tony who placed the first exact when if i ever held in my hands and immediately i felt an overwhelming sense of possibility holding that little penknife we would interrupt the report cards when the came in the mail and then tony took careful pains to explain this whole process to me his flunkey a term that came uncomfortably close to becoming literal over the photocopy in the library feting dimes into the machine he was playing slots in search of a copy that did not blur or show the incisions in the original look man he said through his trendy an tent john ledonglasses o bancarstyle even then you just got to remove the two from the twenty three absences and then lighten the reproduction and now he got three absences in first period instead of twenty three now take the eight from the forty eight move the fore over and but the eight in front of that and now i have obedience punish instead of a near oh i said in total understanding a big smile growing on my face give hem mat arrive he skies for a day teach him how to forge it was ridiculously short sight ad shower but at that age i never thought further than the immediate threat simply convincing my mother everything was quiet at school was enough for me dealing with school records in the larger consequences of robbing myself of even a substandard education all that i would face at a litter day and certainly have tony would usually borrow his mother's car for our expedition a blue olzmobile delta eighty eight we leave school and drive the south podgy island i resort town at the end of a twenty eight mile highway i felt much more cosmopolitan the bronzwill texts ever cud we did that drive back and forth three or four times a day listening to led zeplen nodding our heads in unison with whomever else was stone her do ton the car my juniority and his seniority pony's parents by him a someday moment it was a year he would most assuredly graduate they felt and it was a chance for him to developed responsibility in the mornings the senate my mother would drop me off at school and disappear round the corner tony would drive around in park rig in front of the school to pick me up right in front of everybody true you got a come skipping with me to day he would say but on one particular morning late n nineteen eighty eight i balk now tony i got to go back to glass to day i protest it is thursday and i have not been since last week look he says i got two sundry entry slips i can get you back in to morrow or next week it is not a problem and i fought a new place to get killer weed finding pot was always the problem when tony said he founds of one new and it was not one of the morons who hung out by the tense costs before school i was entreat we first drive to a housing project east to school were a woman sold two daughter ports of unwiser out of her living room from a cooler to any one with one no questions asked we buy a couple of quarts and smoke the last half joint tony has on the way to his new killer beats of car i was getting a bit high when i began to recognized the rout he was taking and was in thoroughly taken e back when he drove right into my grandmother's driveway i could not understand why it just did not make sense this was the same driveway my family poetic would regularly point after church on sundaes when i was growing up in the late nineteen seventies my mother's mother's house and downtown bronsville i was i think the term is in nerved my two uncles johnny and able were working on a seven nine torero when tony tries up an pars hood to hood with their car the hood was up another were both leaning into the guts of the engine there heads popped up bearded biker prairie dogs i sat frozen in the passenger seat uncertain what to do new tony noticing that i was startled told me to be cool to chill out these got look mean but there all right anyways he says as his getting out of the driver side the kind of dumb but they got great weed did not i know it table and johnny had a long history with local biker gangs even a rumored affiliation with the hills angels they could get drugs nobody else could in this town and as a result they were total burn outs hardly capable of logan speech patterns in either english or punish they landed and jail as often as other people attended church but what they lacked in brains they certainly made up and brown not that they tearer part of teenager toner me not in the daylight anyway they had a coed about that sort of thing but if they felt cheated they have taken a tire iron to my head long before they recognized me as her nephew they were that burned out i sit there paralyzed in the front seat side b of houses of the holy playing on pony's case day i because it is hot the a c is blasting whence tony closes the door i cannot hear anything i just watch as his terrifying panto mine plays out before me tony half shaven in his prep clothes closes the door in hales is greeting my uncle abele already brain dead from years o sniffing paint narrows his eyes and suspicion and then noiselessly responds with the nodding hey tony averts on contact looking anywhere but directly at abele for fear that able my charge a gorilla table gives om a suspicious quick upward jut of the chin that says did i sill to you before who told you i got weed tony lowers his head in quiet confidence talking to able then my uncle johnny notch towards me in the car says something to tony they all turned to look at me my eyes go wide a big smile on my face nodding tony says something and then they all laughed together let zeppelin still plays loudly in the car then my uncle able slaps tony on the back and heads him around of the back of the car right where i am johnny stands there too looking at me in smile in makes his next finger and thumb into a mock roach and laughs i am epic the roach back even now he does not recognize me then tony and able emerge around the other side of the car with pony's hand in his pocket and both of them are laughing your suddenly old friends tony turns an waves and both johnny and able wife back the door opens and tony says dude we got a big joint for two boys as he gets in the driver's seat this his free to be out to no and able an johnny are both waving making the universal roach smoking signal as we drive off and it leaves me feeling really really conflicted the car slips up the southern most terminus the highway seventy seven and we had north from urban brownswell to drive around as we smoke the joint tony lights it and it starts burning purple purple hates he says and then follows that with his characteristic h hame as sir a kind of scared about soccer have never seen when burn as to ah dude says toxin do not worry about those gigs got killer weed man they bikers a something it is probably laced with something that is why it was two boys this idea sounds appealing to tony it scares a out of me we are both getting in credibly high layman says tony would not it be estop if wen you were high your hair went into a huge garage fro and the higher you were the bigger your fro got you cannot go anywhere because people would be man that git stoned i sit there an pony's car and think about my uncle's johnny enable tony had been stabbed in the back with the flathead end screwdriver about a month earlier in a street fight his long had been punctured and my grandmother said you could hear whistling every time he inhaled he would not go to the hospital to get a treated for three days we are halfway done with the joint when i say to tony layman i do not want to get stoned any more a well put it out tony says nodding his head back and forth to upland pony's loot hand his fingering cords into the neck of an imaginary guitar as he driving i watch his fingers move for a few seconds suspended and twisting a round there and overturned keen card and i can find no correlation with the cords in sin man i mean i do not want to smoke pot any more i say to him i do not want to skip class any more it want to get back to school not to day but in general i do not want to feel this any more i am doing something bad i feel this all the time now dirty look at that really small house over there we were on an over pass and i just noticed a house beneath us on the brownies country club about a quarter o the sizes of the houses surrounding it tony starts laughing hard o have to make a focus back on the driving but then i laugh along with hi your stoned he tells me yah i say i am awaystoned oh layman i say a little later we are driving back to south power land now those guys we bought went from earlier to day the bikers tony says that was my grandmother's house man those are my uncles i say even though i really embarrassed by it tony finds his be fuddling he cannot figure out with the bikers were doing at my grandmother's house those dudes were my mom's brothers man my uncles i explain tony is laughing hard he had to pull over to the side of the road his laughing is infectious and i find myself laughing right along with him laughing harder that i have laughing a really really long time but i am feeling utterly beyond redemption on the inside i just dun something to day that i could not take back mi course was now set e to mingle martinis reading has story from his memoir the boy kings of texts n act to not my first time at the radio parents and children are life long mirrors for each other how do you see me how do is see myself through my relationship with you even when you are not face to face with one of your parents there conversations between you that play back in your head your whole life what they said what you said sometimes you repeat those conversations to explain to someone else or to yourself who you are or who your parents are but what if you could revere the actual dialogue decades later not your memory of it but the words that were truly spoken between you and apparent while back i did a story about some one who got that exact chance bill lay he was in his early twenties and on the phone with his father in nineteen seventy eight when he heard a faint pinging sound on the phone he mentioned it and his father said an meter or r r r her u er two decades later after his father had died bill was at his dad's house in oho cleaning out the office and i open up a fill caftan and found thirty our forty coset tapes with his unmistakable hand written stations of names and dates and and i knew instantly what they were but he had been a surreptitiously tearing us even at the time his father was recording bill had guessed what could be going on it was the kind of thing his father might do and he did he recorded hours of calls with bill and according to his own handwritten labels he also tape his four other children his wife his mother other relatives his priest he recorded calls at home and in the car the o or r o o from the dates on the cassettes bill figured they were in arrive if his father trying to get the people around him on to his side bill's mother had left his father after thirty seven years of marriage bill remembered the just and tone of those conversations pretty well they were memorable and he put off listening to the recordings of them for twelve years they sat in a black nylon defile bag that he would move every time the family moved this was a pile of information bill was not sure he wanted from an era of his life he knew he did not want re live he coded with his mam in the divorce even before the divorce since junior high he would been lobbying her to leave his dad as bill saw his father he was share tenacious and a tremendous bully with a bad quick temper and huge blow ups he got worse over time and he is worse when he drank what bill remembered from the taped conversations were long calls where his father bullied him and he fought back hard he saw himself as his mother's advocate and protector i remember him train a recruit me in his campaign and keep thesis marriage together and and my a memory was i me saying versions of get she isn't want to do that any more you goes have tried for long time a let it go in some first on hug face facts it is over you remember pushing back verbally arguing with him ye ye all the time ado those twelve years of holding on to the tapes bill finally reached just about the age his father had been when he made the recordings and suddenly bill wanted to hear them he feltready but nervous here was a dad about what i actually did in conversations with my tad and i just took one of the types with me his my name on it and when into our car in the back of our house partially cause it was the only place that had a case taper carter that i knew of and the first thing came on was his voice pretty aggressively question any me about something and his voice was as clear as the day i heard it she can been er in you yo san i ted want e ti sag e r er i e r his father was talking about the fact that bill and his for siblings all sided with their mother in a divorce in one way or another o the did you do i but you an a she mother she be a pase you i she was going on in a peel ere how would you feel big in can a can the situation were you or ye one can be pe cache company she can e a be in en e an can pa she can in can e as we can e ben in nan a pastry i can i can i yer ai yo an if you we me big and i listen for probably two minutes and i was one that is what they are this is just really intense i but took at the tape out went back and went into the house told my wife about it and didn't listened to them again for i don't three formonths when bill went back to listening for real whet he heard was his father pushing one main point with him hour after hour which was how about you talking your mother into trying again what d you feel about that i sum ever ye a r ha r er or was anybody wit de cot yo bill possibly pes easily is i care that she does not pry whet her he wants to or not we have your obviously is know it is not set they have to go down the train and lose the war for he battles without it without in is to me sort a er r be wit a punch of em what to hols o wen a to a good time why do you look at tuna pa a he r or e o then you yet no remember any yer we had no happiness boy i we just said you reversely a times when we did to a you was your may dot sidersatit we use to go to your we had a logic at times you we you saying that we is no use the what is to bott om i what to get down to is a lotic conversation weren't tell me what you magic up it all you indicating that we do not why now i want to know why do you take long day action unlike say some us do not sit there om i was less confrontational line than i remember expected but i i could remember that that thought process that i went through if i say acts he is on a blow up if i say we i tan throw my mom under the buss i a no i a o o or all not not know long ti may be fore five years do what er er mind might be li did and you may not be yourself a lo of can here well do you realize it er mind might be if it you may not be yourself a logical i on a yes do you would you to see it we a happy if we can arrange to be together why do not you say that where was in the warrior in me where was the stand up person that was willing to call a li a lie a a we know willing to draw bright lines and say i am not when i am not a will not even put up with a communal having a conversation about this and some of these conversations go on long a me forty five minutes an hour i just hammering away at you i mi and at the points he is making why did you stay on such a long time i why not to say out got ago ye now i om i i man i was always living is cousin during me lot of this taping i felt badly that my mom was back there would basically by yourself dealing with him and and i think i had some notion that by staying on the for with him in a sika little bit of the radio clown in other h old radio clowns would be sent out the the cowboy would be buff off the boll send a distant wo disco the to go out to distract the boll i was not crossed by the difference between when he hurried and the tapes and the tough line he would remembered taking his dad that it did throwing off balance he really had seen himself from the time he was a kid as a warrior standing up to the strong detecting the weed a sort of superhero when it came to arguing against his dad but i was less heroic was i i was more pragmatic it was less of an aspect struggle of right and wrong and more mundane than that i mean what kid fanaticize us about being a pragmatist i oh bill says his mother thrived after the divorce his father he says stayed more or less the same he married again divorced again bill kept up a relationship with him his whole life that had been his other goal during these calls besides protecting his mam not losing his dad he had thought about that even during the worst arguments theater a long silence than words he could not take back ill saw his father once or twice a year every year after the divorce and he spoke to him by fun every few weeks since we died r r r coming up what the move the breakfast club can teach you about parenting if you were in the breakfast club that is in a minute from chico public radio when our program continues it is this america life i am nancy unlike sitting in for i a glass every week we choose a theme that and we present various stories on that theme to days show is that what i look stories of seeing yourself through other people's eyes whether you want two or not and were here at at three which i think is going to come f two partner at three bend you one to do that part for they the blunder years i am talking to ben callous one of the producers here and he is got a small story he is embarrassed to tell it but i am making him ben ye take us back eighth grade eighth grate and i should just say i played tuba i was small that was me and definitely zero attention from the girls and roosevelt middle school i had this teacher though who her name was a miss savage she was the school teacher a bet ye she was younger than pretty much every teacher in the school she was into jane a diction and she was the the the rocking told teacher and all of the kid sort of idolized her can we are going in a g p g direction with this rate just e of at yum tine there was just is one day when i am just standing in the class room and that was it was a crowd of girls that were standing around miss savage and and a i do not i have no idea what they were talking about and miss savage is saying something and then out of the blue it says it she points to me i am staying i the other side of the room and she says it look out for that ben callous he is going to be a heartbreaker and did the girls turn and look it was a crowd of faces invited satellites and looked at me and i was just i do not i do not totally know what happened but but it feels maybe my life might have change just brit de and you mean what legate can't yet yet did the girls come a start to notice one girl in particular that is what you been ye and that really can be all you need to change your life when your tea nature just one person who thinks your great because chances are your own sense of yourself is way off the friend of a friend this is a woman in her fifties came across an old photo of herself as a tea nature and it had been years since she would seen any pictures of herself at that age and she looked at them and thought oh wait i was pretty i was pretty it kind of forever because of course the girl in the pictures looked nothing the way she thought of herself at the time she said she wished she would known it back then at would've made a difference lots of us have had that experience looking at old family pictures or your books seeing things we never saw at the time this next story is a very specialized case of that kind of thing it is about the actress molly ringhals who of course does not just have photos but movies beautifully shot wide screen full length holly would films of herself as a tea nature she is the red head the star in those three iconic eighty's movies by john hugs pretty and pink sixteen candles in the breakfast club recently she revisited one of those movies not exactly by choice and she talked to ire glass here is idea i suppose is non a big surprise that mall ringhals does not sit around watching old many ringhals films in a shes seen him she need a big reason to go back to them i recently her daughter gave her a reason her daughter manila is ten and manila wanted to see the breakfast club wrist ten as little young to we the breakfast club but muster her friends had seen it it was kind of weird that she was the only one that had not seen this moving and a she said that it was a conversation at slumber parties where that is a move that some kids want a watch and that she had always said pellet add want a watched can we watch something else because she wanted to watch it with me i to that was surly nice i wonder if it is if it is she once to watch it with you that is a nice thing to say to your mam but but the the truth could also we she just does not want to watch it with that in i mean ai can you imagine watching your mam with a group of your friends and you have no idea what is about to happen yah i didnaneven really think about that but ye i am sure that had something to do with it manila does not not surprises a the fact is mall ringwill preferred to watch it with manila it just see milk it might be a nice experience to share together n the we things in the film that she knew that she was going to want to talk to manila about for instance there is a scene where she smokes pot in the film as a tea nature molly showed her the breakfast club not sure it all how she was on to react not sure what it would be to see the film through manila's eyes resin er a tapercorter to record what happen e which by the way maid loved the tapprcuorter so she have talking in to the tapegrisho oud answering questions though she is not can hear this ready story for a long time that is the plan the breakfast club if you have never seen it is five kids the stuck together in school on a sturdy for all days to mention the kids who never would normal talk to each other in school it is a jock a brain a tough kid a popular girl and an outside er girl and it s john hues make the bond talking about all these things that everybody feels in high school and you can totally see white still gets to kids and white's the john huesfilm that ally ringhals looks back on that is her favorite she ma good u they make popcorn they fit is around with to and you do not stars are just thus they do not know how to operate the video systems either they can not figure at out to turn it on and is a dah d m i t m on i deny m i i it sounds really silly i mean it it is it is it was almost a date i were you just you just want everything to go get yow i did not want her to i did not want her to not it i we did not want her ti get bored o get i i of yo what s yo any point during the him we you had second out s about at without thou watching it with her that the sex stuff i was i was a little a i was cringing how you little bit r you retire fret or psychological i did not mean a tat a you go safety worth in my out there is a whole part whereveryone saying did you do it did you do it why just answer the question you nobody answer as o the question we told to that i am thinking just can ask me what are they talking about but then she just did not ask it was she was not all of that stuff she just did not want to know and i was trying to sort of ask her what she got out of that what she thought we were talking about but trying to ask her in such a way where i would not tell her where i would not end at talkintout sex if she did not know all all the talk about did she do it did she not do it all of that stuff kind as who the what tho par well they were did did you do it did you do it care just answer the question i answer the question a wish fa the a and my husband sitting there looking at me just stop to she does not get it this is the first time that you saw the film as a parent did you see it differently absolutely i i really did i lay i really kind of felt for the parents for people have not we the breakfast club a lot of it is about the kids being disappointed in the parents y and how alone and isolated and frustrated you feel with your parents and now i see the moving and i just i think their poor parents and and i think that when it was pointed out to me that that the move just talks about how all parents socking i then i thought in my mind well actually thou that might be kind of good because then she can see that that she does not have parents that and then she can appreciate and but that can go another way ye that was my focus i guess a case afterwards you are talking to her about the film an there this moment that gets surprisingly emotional and only to you that which character when when the characters talk and you think oh that is what i feel are there anything that you say that that is what i feel us split a bit o is he li bring something ye ye bran i should say is the straight a student whose parents pressure him to get good grates paid by thirty michael hall you can atheling grin you do he is really sweet and a kind sometimes finish you means a you think i i re thee well really no no no to me tell me oh e no w s none sweet it is c it is ka i i am just i am just surprised you a just just fairly a little bit er o a young that is really justle to know i no inter when did i make you feel the i o a died better oh because i i said that i wish i did better i you wanted me to do i am sorry i mane you feel that way very day do you remember the things she is talking about of you saying other oh i wish that i had done better in school i was really surprised i was not expecting that at all i am and the only thing that i can think of really is we have this home work battle and it is incredibly frustrating and it is for standing to get her to do the work it is yah it because it is really easy i mean and i not to saying that isn't adult i mean it is easy she did to work for her it is easy work for her if she would just sit down do it it would it would take fifteen minutes twenty minutes ah but she resents the fact that she has to do it much and it it became such a battle that she would sort of lie sprawled out kind of barely write you could not even read her writing and i would just get frustrated with her and and i would yellow her and say you know you can do better than aster martinis sin all the things the parents say and i think it it i it must have affected her and then she said well you bee n you do not do it any more and the reason why i do not do any more because i do not do her home work with her any more because i cannot i find it too frustrating i when she said that i thought o she just being protective of you i think she was being protective of me to i think the thing that i notice the most was manila kind of wanting to i am make me feel like she really did not want to hurt my feelings or make me upset and she wants to please me to i can hear that when i ye well the felt that the next thing that happens she instantly goes to i have better parents than they do i know it script i know is here anything else that you got out of the move that you o i like what do all i that of parents than thou are just your just saying that to make me feel better come on i mean it was bazaar how she just said the thing that i hoped she would get it she knows i mean she can in to it that she knew that it that that i was hoping for that yes she was giving me a little present captain a a but tat i member word does not feel that at all know no not at all the whole thing after wondering a lot about what happened when me total cried and how she handled it and should you have let ta total talk for longer in shoe she of actor or questions a different questions you need just can never know what things at you say o your kids a going to stay with them and your just little things said in a passing moment that in a bounce around in their heads and read them to conclusions

well it is the end of the road for nickel hale the former you an ambassador under a donate trump former governor of south caroling she is dropping out of the race to day because donate true dominated supertuesday this of course was not a show the only question was why she was staying in because the reality was that every state except fer sermon trump not only one he wont con mincingly in her home state of south caroling he beat her by about twenty point yo beat her sixty to forty in north caroling he better seventy three to twenty three in virgin he better sixty three to thirty for these are all particularly virgin virgin is a moderate republican state tat is not a left wing republican state and an or righting republican state and he beat her very soundly in that state in californium he bee her seventy eight to eighteen what this suggests is that she really had no shot at the nomination after swan know one had a shot at the nomination after i as i pointed out which you bi rondo mantis dropped out early it is also who nickel hale then stated in in the hope that should win new samphire she did not win new samphire she over for a little bit and then she stated in pass that mainly two think put up a flag to the rest of the republican party that should trump lose in nonmember she will be the leader of the position ready to come in and take over i think that to miss reed of how re publicans think of dona trump i think that even if donate trump loses in nonmember in the general election she jobidon it is very unlikely the the republican party is then going to swivel and turn to nickel half a specially because nickel hale seems to making the same the stake that is had crews made in twenty screen after losing the primaries to donate trump you will recall that that cruise than went to the republican national convention and he said vote your conscience instead of just in horsing trump he is to of left it up in the air pleasing no one he suggested to the trump voters than maybe he was not support of of trump and to the not trump voters at maybe he was support of of trump an means t up winning no backing because of that nickel hale seems to be playing the same game which does not seem particularly politically smart to me it is one thing her nickel haleytsat i am staying in is an alternative to trump betas i think that he is going to lose but now that he is the nominate he is the hominy for herd of sit outside and not in worse trump seems to me a a bit of political you practice according to the pastry journal hailed plans to open her republican president tall primary bid in a speech on wdnestay the former south caroling governor and you an ambassador is expected to make appearance to deliver brief o mar remarks around ten am eastern her vision rive the day after super tuesdaysio one only sermon among the fifteensdays on sermon is basically candida she is not going to announce an indorsement on wednesday however she is going to encourage donate trump to earn the support of republicans and independent voters who have backed her which presumably could theoretically be if i i vice presidential play may be she is hoping that he picks her as sort of a unity ticket not given his dominant performance in the primaries very unlikely this plowing tat he feels the necessity to do that not of again a turn toward who he actual does pick for his v p there a lot of people who ben mention ranging from lady van the enter from oho to him scout the senator from south caroling we will have to wait and we dona trump for his part delivered a super tuesday victory speech in which he triumphantly proclaimed that he was the hominy which of course have been true basically since give once you one i what the thing was over awe watch tar cantata great beating of the last three years and nobody tot o thing my i be massive we would not have resign attacking you gran we would not have hes you being attack e ran action know is be won o is stoning thing tin we be thinking ha money flow must sit in at one fin his below we an known floating tin platoon is to string tin it e class is testing everything in elation yo e back o i the his the handy ideas tack it called tan elation is call the country best than that is what is ton t con t wat hatpin with an elation i tin underlyteble the lot of people say a on o ten ti si a the stack to i y thing ti string welkin that string well be was or pod own to much her than jobihims it is to all of that is thou up for the lascar nobody is really suggesting that these took market is doing well because of the expectation that donate trump is going to win in nonmember the stock market is doing well because when you in late the currencehe people do not have any other place to put there investment money if he put your investment money in cash it loses values people as started investing in speculative stock bubbles which is why the price to earnings ratios right now on wall street are completely out of wack an probably were experiencing o bubble on that out ones industrial average in the york stock is change for example dona trumpet then went on to rip jobidon on migrant crimaga he is doing the right thing in this victory speech which just put all the focus on jobidon if this ins his sampan is about you didn't tobidon is not going to win trump i think knows that the only question is whether trump steps on himself he did not do a last night really if the is nubs tribe tin probably the hi to of the world its ta say ti we wits haiti ta sit a sit o being over ran with y in crying and that been my gin can but its tin knew cabin oi can an is violent i they'll stand an e tee is the an a is tat it pole e i is en theetenen the en is to wen they came they be tilled instantly instantly they would not do that the world is leafing in is the world is taking enegyof us three years ago we level when engine even we en the ratio the enemy dominant en to they were getting weld for tens way li can you believe it again he is not wrong about any of this sort of stuff now the exit polls for republicans show that their top issue was immigration which is not a surprise because it is in fact the top issue in the country right now even according to much of the polling data for the general america population the reality is that emigration is a top issue because people are looking at the insane amount to be legal immigration under job your tong about at least seven million people have entered the country legally while jobidon has been president layaway be swept to ten milling we literal have no idea and people see that as a crisis because it is in fact a crisis o the expels showed that was the top issue for republicans now very often when you take ecipols people will say the economy but that is always tongue nobody actin knows with that means i have seen re publican primary people are going to pick the issue that is chemist polarized issue because their voting republican at not a shock their picking i migration but the reality is the according to a put research cents a survey taken just last month it shows that emigration is a top issue for a huge majority of america dealing with emigration fifty seven per cent of america say the that to be the top priority this year is dealing with illegal emigration when it comes emigration job is twenty points under water this of course is leading democrats down a real rabbit hole here they have two choices that hung the moderate on emigration or they can pretend that voters are out of their minds obviously they are on to do what you thing thing on to do the obviously going to pretend the voters are crazy and out of their minds last night on pemican be we after the exit polling came out showing republicans care not emigration democrats gensoki who the former presecretary for jobidon we are mocking republicans for carrying about emigration and if you look at for the t pulse in in virago inti ration was the t c cat inn pe to order wit we forth a a or maybe people are worried that he legal emigrants are going to show up where they live and might commit crimes or may be they are worried about the vast cultural changes that could be wrought by importing millions of people who have no familiarity with america concepts of things freespeege and property rights or maybe they are simply worried about the fact that you are generating in entire economic under class of people many of whom will be dependent a welfare benefits and many of whom are going t be lowering the wage basin the my there a lot of reasons why people in virgin might be worried about illegal emigration and again democrats are disconnected from this issue this is the issue among the issues the pew surveys in which there is the biggest gap between how democrats think and how independent thin forget about publicans independents cording two the polling data from put thirty nine per cent of democrats believe that emigration is a real concern compared to fifty seven percent of independents in seventy six per cent of re publicans that is a high number of independents who are deeply worried about emigration and the numbers up from fifty three percents in twenty twenty three and forty nine per cents in twenty twenty two democrats meanwhile still stock down in the minorities on this thing when it comes to policy goals again in dependents look more republicans on a lot of these issues than they wink democrats on a lout of these issues that is a problem for the democrats the white house because they are stuck as i have been saying in this legs media echochamber in which the idea for them is doubled down on the bases they are ignoring all this to the white house yesterday for example they were asked about lagan riles murder whey can rely of course with theyoung woman who is killed the university of georgia by legal emigrant and the white house tried siblings one from for that that dog is not going to hunt the president of the united states is jobidon he needs to close the border everybody knows it well hers the by public we we areas murwewehande we e e we r ere wan to always always be sure that we let lift up the families a lost they lets in that way i would be re mist if did not continue to say that republicans o protected a by part can proposal that came out of the sent and they truly truly cared about what was going on at the word if they truly cared about the emigration o says and trying to fix that trying to to for it in a step and swayed where we have a tough and fair law they would work with us on it they would listen to the former president who is clearly telling them to reject telling republicans to rejected for there for his own political cane a want if they thing this is a winning politiclargment the out of their minds and this again goes to the reality of to day's modern politics an that is reverencing the medias con minced that the right wing has gone crazy and he going too far right in her picking crazy candidates an there is some truth to that who could the last round of senatorial races s republicans picked among to terrible candidates and along of winnable races n then they lost those races but democrats are now doing the same thing we now have a game of chicken and which both sides have decided to put the radical brick on the on the accelerator and then just aim the cars at each other and the question is who is going to rollaway firs before the cars crash whoever pulls way first in this case actually winds i is not as though if you just continue along that path an whether got plus away u win it is the opposite in fact basically this game of chicken is both cars are aimed at the cliff with side is going tho stop before the cliff at all for get about close to the ad who is gin stop at all the reason i point this out is to cause yesterday custom minima the senator from arizona who started off as a democrat and then governed as a moderate democrat in what is a moderate purple state purple arizona is a purple state it was largely red state had a state assembly and a state legislator that stay senate that were both were publican with dug duty arizona governor as theirepublican until just very recently and then the prison republican party decided they ware going to shoot themselves to erectly in the cast by embracing every form of election questioning they possibly could alienating every moderate in the entire state and electing two democratic senators and a democratic governor lady hobs who whet dish rag over in arizona now the problem is that the under long political character of the state of prison a romances purple there is a reason why in til very recently both senators were purple to red senators it was it was on mac cane until he passed away and flake until dona trump basically destroyed him and this were both we place by democrats and the democrats wo re place them have had to govern from queasy the middle from mark kelly who one of the senators he is attempted to govern as sort of ate bluish purple democrat custom sentimo who's purple the sheeventually just went purple in decided to declare herself in in dependent but then she decided not to run for reelection because the democratic party basically caster out and they decided to primary hero instead of just having custom minima be in independent burn standers who caucuses with the democrats which is what custom sentimo would do the in thrustor enough they decided to run against her rebel ago who is a far leftist in arizona and the poles were showing a pretty even three ways split with custom sentimo in the rays he had the entire democratic party behind gig there is an emersion college pulling hill survey at was taken just a couple of weeksago and in found the rebel gringo had thirty six per cent support thirty per cent for carylak the re publican hominy for the senate and twenty one per sent for custom sentimo thirteen per cent undecided ad custom sentimo looked at that democrats could have easily dominated this race if they a just set o if in rococo a run against custom senior we understand season and penibichism polkas thus whir its can a stay out she easily wins reelection in arizonis topee popular sender but they decided not to do that and to now they're basically getting rid of her in favor of ruin gringo which makes their race actually significantly had has garage is not in the main stream of arizona politics according to the walsterturnal seams that show will not run for reelection and were retire after this term and in for now the political run of when of congress is most productive and controversial lawmakers a sentries who forge by partizan deals while also regularly an going progress of democrats this it differencing by the way then republicans basically saying to met competes time free to go the reason that differences cause you taught is a deep red state you tough is a blood red state arizona is a purple state and for democrats to get rid of a purple senator who is going to caucus with them in favor of a far left candidate gazebo is really a fascinating turn of a tens now if only re publicans had nominated some one who for example had not run for governor and lost in tan claim that who on for the last year and a half a gat that might that might bet night but they did not do that they ran carry lake instead it is carry verses rebel gig clash of the titans over in arizona demonstrating once more who ever seizes the middle ground is going to win these elections but both parties in some cases seems to be rung away from middle ground ironically in the presa actual race it is jo bison who running away from the middle ground and does trump who reaching over and grabbing it weirdly enough but many of the state races trump is on has been had as a super right wing mad a ago very far extreme as right moment and a lot of people being nominator are people who are also abandoning the middle which is not smart see the dirty secret have been saying about dona trump is that he is politically moderates and rhetorically extreme and many of the people have ben running are politically extreme and rhetorically extreme which is not what amaricans are superinto and by the way even rhetorically extreme only works hormonal trump it really is not work for anyone else dona trump is a one of one in the same way the brocoboma for democrats was a one of one you cannot be trump there is no one who can out trump trump he's nobodywho can even be in that some category trump is a stand up comedian who became president of the in ted states because he is extraordinarily entertaining he is camera magnetic he is always funny think all those things our things that no other politician can hold that scandal to because hes inane completely different category he is an an entertainer who became a politician not a politician trying to be an entertainer in any case craton sent m a being lasted from the democratic party in then retiring means that democrats are also lasting the people who are supposedly reaching to the mom now to be fairer to the democrats with her out of the race i had to have matches between dago and lake shows the giggles lead actually expands to seven points forty six of thirty nine with fifteen per cent undecided lake is can have to reach out toe mental if she wants to win that race but for his par burnystanders is triumphalist about this burned sanders on the far left the party the ya we are dragging the entire party fart the left to the for a reherstalday a there is a on secular cursor senora anole that she will not be seeking reelection this fall aka ha my a halt of ceglogon o missed are you ahaaha us r lo glow him missed not e grand person i says says the crazed old football socialist but that is the democratic party they have decided they in cater to the burning wing of the party rather than the can cinimaling in the party jobidon ranis christen intima and govern is burnysanders which is actually a really bad strategy which means that he has kind of one final opportunity to put a new face on his presidency that of course s going happen this week with his state of the union address as political points out the state of the union may be one most vastly operated speeches an all politic ben not this year the address join setidaliveround thursday night will come as the president faces intensifying words about his age and vitality and ow host of confounding international prices in do mystic challenges that backdrop has dramatically lighten the states for the white house with millions of viewers turning in it not just to hear the words mutters but how he physically delivers them and this of course is the key the key is not to the state of the union whether jobidon says anything memorable when istle last time a president said anything memorable during a state of the union addressed at all terrible state of the union addresses i hate them i hae hem every single year our who the president is or of what party they are anarchic spectacle in which the other branches of the america government are expected to treat the president as though he is an emperor the state of the union was suppose to be a letter issued from the president to t he legislature giving them an update on things that we are going on because government was originally really small and then it is turned into the pathetic imperial spectacle in which the president walks in and everybody cheers for him and kiss the r it is just ridiculous is ridiculous stupid thing i hate it every single year it is stupid got it is particularly stupid when you have a president hoiden was to be peeled in on a turning in order to make the statement but it will be entertaining this year as i have been saying for a long time since join to the presidency watching hoiden speak is in fact quite exciting not the what he thinks it is butts very exciting is exciting because it is washing the slander brothers right you are watching somebody cross tight robe in windy weather above volcano and when golden speaks the big question is not going to be how how well does he do its how badly he will do there is no world in which you walks out and he is super care is magic and absolutely fascinating as s rhetorically shocking shot i j somebody who you look at nut was that isn't inspirational figure the question for hoiden is whether he is going to physically collapse on stage obviously will be covering this over at daily fireback stage wring be covering alive tomorrow nights make sure the sunn over it daily wire to come for that but the big question is going to be wether jobidon physically survives the speech which means the expectations are quite low it also means unfortunately for him that again the more inability people get of jobidon the less they him jobidon yesterday was at how he things he's doing in the race and he said i am winning no ai erg w m for a a a or bite paper n and then's postman is very moment for him because it lurking in the background is his worst nightmare stairs i but it'll also points out o this pointed that is nitro all the last five polls that have been taking he is losing in three of them the only ones where he is owning his inside the margin of error those to be morning consult and side my in virtually everyone before that he is losing that is not true also again one of the reasons he is losing is because he is no longer with us or yesterday who in a press conferments and he does this weird thing where he says the stage directions out loud when in if geverbendo played their stage directions and the stage sections exit stage left be can what jobidon reads that like hill sort of just read the stage directions pubic i now time to takes i better notquestions agacenstage la job now here he go in no struck you caution grin table with one preside as y at he breathes every breath could be a daft rattle my goodness pics up the maroon ts tie beater not take questions or pe bodkin he needs the dart water suit i this is that this this bad guys it is it is just not good and then non he said yesterday that his staffroom drop him a note when it was drop that time unfortunate language for the barely sentient president withthot i am return stover the was the direct o nan in on counsel but it post to live for me it me e business one on telephone but i am one h hand round an ta i wit you are iron miss i to state yuan o my myself to to on ta ta o curs as e no what was that what in the world's that m a on to on the on the order an mi en a stick run is i that is ski i he put about that okra the thing he actually campaign in yesterday all thatches can being ridiculously he not but the thing he actually campaign on o not getting him is shrink elation he believes that he is going to be able to plan off he is poor you canonic record on in elation on the greed of corporations that a putting less in the potato chit bad an charging the same out o money which is his fault in elation is your fault you are the president in elation began when you entered office my friend but here he was yesterday but he was not his tongue out shrank elation which again a that that is can be a hell of a campaign slinging o jo i a verify shrink elation he i i swear he sounds a stanza talking about shrinkage here except he is siting the cooky monster now the open question in this particular clip is whether your bid believes the cooky monster to be a real thing bi whether the cooky monsters a sentient being who walks around on the earth and eats cookies here ye here is you bid quoting the cooky monster this is where we a folks but in fact some of the small snack companies you will not i and think you don't even notice e pig i when they charge you just as monk through the san sit eager state i as hell to cur crimson i tell you what i tell you did notice the cookie most he point out cookies his cookies again smaller an want is i was stun a con a tat a at noise i doctor cookie the said mister basemen sees for cooky of at all i cookyisas i mister cook monster can we re most in en a monster show up not on ever en e pot mean ana ah anyway he is everything's going well get ready for seventy two minutes at that to your night who is come hang some strong stuff but it is a against is not just that he is see class that he is bad that he is bad he is bad at the presidential the most obvious the most obvious placewher he is bad at the presidential right now is in the entire conflagration between israel and compass the united states has continues prove material support to israel but rhetorically they've ben under cutting israel at every possible turn in their battle against the genicitle terragroup andtheyve beendeclaring that station negotiate with this genicitle terrigroup who colonelcy holds six america citizen hostage by the way among he one hundred and thirty four hostages we do not nohomany our alive and come of as they do not know how many our live which is a making a got o say come off they are in credible a counting bodies but they have no idea showman hostages are alive a boy hats and five seconds later it is twenty seven thousand two hundred and twenty one people have been killed all of them children and all of them poets and then tali sure you knows been three and half sons since we took a hundred dirty for hot we have no idea how many those people are alive heard how your counting skills why old lead grade the menu the we are talking about the people who you are keeping in captivity and raping re routinely presumably the by administration has taken the rhetorical side of commons by pro claiming a moral equivalence he here's the thing when you proclaim a moral equivalence between a murderer and the person that person is trying to murder between the murderer and the victim you're siding with the murder if you say hey hell up here we have one and here we have not call and sure are nice is own the floor bleeding an sure n call has rates o self defense if she stole alive but let us be real there have been mistakes made on all sides your taking the side of one at that point and that is what thy by ministration has been doing rhetorically which again is the worst thing they can do because if you grand in soda of rhetorical sympathy to derris they are going to push they are going to realize that they now have leverage over you and that is what commosrealizes the number of lies this ad ministration has either fallen for or told themselves on behalf of comes is insane at this point ' for example we have been hearing that israel we will not ship in aid that is not true israel alawsin hundreds of a tricks every single that but there is no one to distributhiade you want to know why there known to distribute theater in the gosistrip perhaps because compass hi jacks the trucks you are as tape of commas riding a round on the trucks this is from yesterday you see that these are trucks there are two members of commas on top of each one of these trucks these are all civilionswho are standing there being where's my damned food and the answer is compass is stealing all of its and then the by demonstrations hatefully s in the for i within is railway mean about it comes is stealing the aid andtheyre killing people whore trying to get the aid it is totally insane for then israel get's plane retoreclesa israel needs to do more says the bide administration meanwhile to be yesterday says we need a sense fire betas of roman of get i am sorry this bull asked to stop what what its it is i ridiculous this is such ridiculous nonsense romeo is very holy holiday to the terrorist where willing to literally violate every single other human beings religious scruples on roman everybody has to go real easy cause people are fasting between son rise in sunset that go really easy because it turns out terra they love them the roman in a commas land over here the be easy on them because obviously these are people we have to respect their religious scruples that dictate that they should murder pretty much everybody who is not a religious muslin makes perfect tense these obviously they of demonstrated enormous enormous credit brain when it comes to respect for the religions for example when the palistinian grabs we are in charge of the holy sites news cannot get in in fact its just tried to worship at their own holy sites when the estate of israel did not exist for temple western wall riant riots would starlike in nineteen twenty nine and hundreds of news would be murdered movies with it listen if there is one thing that the radical muslin world is known for its respect for the religions which is why they literally blow up churches an build moon top of them or go directly on top of the temple amount and put the dome of the rock directly on top of the jewfish holy of holes from the temple tit is also why they go to hinducites in india blow up the induces ton put arson top because if they are again when were tali bout colonialists religions folks there is one that winds a the most colonials religion of all time is is lot a but that does notes there cant be moderate muscles they are just not in commoslan they are many modern muscle i know somatera museums o people who do not actually believe in the colonial legacy of she real law but to pretend that roman is is that is the deciding factor in whether israel should be able to go and tried to take back at hostages and kill terra is totally insane again demonstrating once again radical muslin sympathy for the religions the lass two majors surprise wars it watched israel were wanted on respectively the yon don't kep lord the holyestanduish calender and intheteny they and him cotton which was to toberseven som out to i is the happyesdate in the jewfish calender an nails me to bishabat s a double holiday for news perfect time for commas to respect the religion and passing ins killings involved s respect to religion of the news by killing twelve hundred of them and bout but jobynsic romeo's coming got be careful aby rot it honestly this it is it is stupid it is stupid their not winning hearts and mines by trying to get a sense fire on behalf of terrorist cups for roman whose whose whispering in job's ear who believes this or is job just believe this in his battle brain obvious was f ma aroma car oh you mean you all you mean that there will be act acts of rioting on the temple mount there is every single year and hen you will blame the news for the acts of writing by the museums on the temple amount i ben up there by the way and h seen world than sugjestanim quit in quote trespassing or invading at the temple amount by which they mean i walk around it that is they mean you are literally barred from praying on the temple amount by the illogic walk long as your a you or i christian by the way your muscle man be up their playing solar needing c donnas which is literally what happens on the templemoun there literally a school in the corner of the temple amount this very holy she to museums were kids are playing poker an flying kites ya i in any case this is stupid but what what exactly to mess by administration they are pursuing a sense fire and compass is rejecting every sense fire commas literally rejected the last sense fire offer that is seas fire offer was at and alter for a six week seas fire in return for leasing the remaining female hostages and comes rejected it outright according to then your time president bids had tuesday talks on a possible six wee seas firing goa are in the hands of commiserate now he spoke just before commosleater in lebanon appeared to reject a proposed deal thou's is backing insisting is really hostages would be released only after seas fire was in place and is rally forces have withdrawn commons knows they are in control because biding wants the seas firer more the he wants is real to strikomoss that is just the bottom line here and because of that bison is now shifting his lying to mirror common according to i twenty for news while holding out for comes to accept to seas firkin hostage release proposal you just an arab negotiers floated a potential short past hostilities while the larger you'll gets ironed outs was out that mean that thou mean calling for a seas fire without any hostages being released which is called loosing is things raiders gan go for that smostin sene stupidity ever it is i ridiculously insane and the media and the political class though i got will the my because jo bison duns an get along with beefy this has nothing to do with join an baby deny goes just visited washington ten he got the same exectreatment from compel derris and trobidon one the great lies of foreign policy is that foreign policy is constructed bast on individual likes and this likes of the leaders of countries it is not is bast on the individual interests of countries an does not matter very much with you or dislike of lander gotten or wethryou get along with him or not what matters is whether his interests are actually in coincident with your own and the same thing holds truth is daily leaders or a palistinian leaders we ought to be absolutely clear and gimlet eyed about the question of a medical national interest and the national interest of other countries and this bazar notion that america has some sort of dis agreement with leaving tong you personally and there fore they to makes him sort a confessions to commas it is absolute stupidity meanwhile by the way heron is activating all its rookies they know they've got a wit the they have a fish on the line and that fish is the bid administration his ball has ben heating up because they know that join ones one thing above all and that is a cease fire in the region and they are rationing up then military action in the attempt to gain concessions sea the united states from the is rallies yesterday from sample yes ball launch fifty rockets into the north of his re now any self respecting country receiving fifty rock its across its border with then go and camp the people on the other side o the border can you amazon if the medical government not the drugcar tells the government because is blat basically runs the government lebanon decided that they were going to watch fifty rockets into sandbag medical city would not exist the next morning and the very least you have marine sipping tee from the capital but here is what the video looks on the northern border of his rower again thirty thousand is rallies haft a abandoned their homes in the north because of hes balathrats n there's widespread expectation in israel at within the next two to three months therewoul be a large scale war in the north with is ball which thieving two hundred thousand rockets it is here is what it looks when a terrorist group fires rockets into another sovereign country this his block launching rock its over the border is real and it is only thanks to the iron done be canst the iron dome which s on being shot up into the cyst to knock down some of these rockets wore to for iron dome the all be falling in killing people the bide administration of course is see in seas fires seas foresees foresees fire and because they are in hock to their radical base its all goes back that central contention the democratic party has moved far to the left if they cannot sea straight any more at all well get to that in just one moment first russia has been in the headlines reeks due to the actions of vladmerpootan obviously to comprehend glad merputns motivations we have to examine the historical contacts that shaped his behaviors in the new season of what we saw in em fire of terror host bill little on masks communism by takin the close look at the history of the soviet union with the use of deep cut photograph and film vernal entries another primary sources this tale of terror offers a compelling presentation on the hours that plagued the movie union and the viciousness of its leaders modern day rush has ben sentries in the making this series will give you a better understanding of it history as well as common ism that threatens our own home land each episode one trimming right now at daily wire plus we're not a dailywar plossmember go to daily wide to comslash subscribed become a member to day again go check that out billitales work is tremendous it is absolutely amazing historical research and and entertaining and interesting infant you can learn something go check it out right now over at daily wire plus also we have a new episode of facts that is coming out the stature's of state tune for that on our you to channel or never you consume our content daily wire a all about russia things you do not know about it the current status of that the country their challenges whether their interest coincide with ours marry check that out on sturdy o can meanwhile speaking of the democratic party captured by radicals again you can see the radical base of the democratic part is pushing join to less and and it is most obvious on a couple of this emigration is one the democratic party could easily cut eight deal with republicans or just intact executive orders in orershuts on the boarder and there not doing it because there hock t the radical base you nails o see it most clearly with regard to israel in comas is the most morally obvious conflict in modern history it is between a democratic state that was literally just attacked wit t worst terror attacks ins tine eleven in the west and a genocidal terror group that is holding hostages right no and suddenly the left of the wile i don't know about that is it is pretty it is pretty convoluted it is pretty i do not know what i would do is why you get morons nit cristofit than your times a moral moral dunce suggesting what i get this question regularly and i acknowledge that israel face to difficult challenge it was hard to taring compass without risking civilians my answer is what i would not to is killed thirty one thousand people in van cover and clouding twelve thousand five hundred children an starve the entire population the question was imagine terristrocats fired from van cover an to portend origan what would you do a but you did not answer the question your question is i wouldn't do what this rallies would do but i will sit here and all pontificatelien giant jack asked this is the left is the left my now s left has decided that basically if you are evil enough this means you earn a free ticket to left inland it is great if your evil enough this suggest that your victimized see in the victim victim victimizer narrative the oppressor oppressed narrative who ever is the worst is considered the oppressed because remember yet the link that up with the left wing idea that every one who acts badly is doing because of childhood drama and people being means o them that people are naturally good and naturally kind and naturally wonderful and therefore if somebody blows himself up in a can they take a on she kids with them then that is probably because they had a really rough childhood and they are the victim not the victimizer that are the victim the worst you act the more evil you are the more you have been victimized by outside forces and thus your actual victims are the victimizer complete reversal victim an victimizer most obvious example of this is audit butlers the youth butler is one of most damaging academics of the last sixty years she is famously a founder of queer theory she is a person who became famous by suggesting that all of gender is a social construct there is no linkage whatsoever between your biology and your behavior it is all social construct she says that the body itself is a social construct that is defined is all about power she says that gender itself is a verb that constructs it is a performance everything is performative and gender is a quit struggle to rework on arms fit which bodies a experience o for most of her life she concert herself woman now she says thanks to gender non bearing nonsense that she helps create she is a thy then but she is religious ta crazy lady and this crazy lady who is respected nacanamic particles because she rates absolute torrid gobbled gook that makes no sense to any one with a sentient prefrontal quartet this told is not just a for on when it comes to gender a theory and her bazar notions that gender is entirely constructed and made up in all the rest of this damage but chatlines up with her bell that terror is are nonfecterise she was talking about these situations can israel and compass the other day and she decided to lay down a theory her theory is that october seven which involved the mass rape of women the murder of men women the slaughter of children the beheading of foreigners and news the kidnapping of women and re seated rape of those women that all of that was just an act of resistance cause after all left understand what we are watch right now is the coalition of the pseudo oppressed to have decided that any system in which they are in successful they are the victims and therefore they can do what ever they want when you link up that oppressor oppressed narrative in which everybody who is a failure has been oppressed in some way everybody who is evil has ben a pressed in some way you link that up whit the friends fa non notion that resistance can come in any form and that is how you and up with audit butler one most evil human beings of the last sixty years sure she was yesterday justifying compass we can have different us about homos as a political party we can have different you canlyabout o arm arm to resistance but i think is u more ones and historically correct to say that the prize thing of out tower seventh as an act of armed resistance it is not a terrine attack and isn't an antisemitic a tack it was an attack i against is really and i didn't that attack i i have gone public with this i have gotten an trouble for sang it to you don't it it went all for me anguishing it was anguishing it was only my l however o made her find may german english however if i then decided that the only violence in the scene was the violent stung to is really people the violent stun to poustinience has been happening for decades this was an uprising that comes out e the comes from a state a subjugation and a once o silent state aporahus oh as as supposed to compass which is not a violent state apparatus or on which is not a violent state apparatus it is the democratic state of israel which has twenty per cent arab citizenry that is the the violent state apparatus according to this absolutely ridiculous piece of film in this truly one o the worst people on the planet truly an off clumping by the way she work she she says that shes assist a jewfish voices for piece the best thing bout jewfish voices for piece is the only actual word in that title that is true is of they are not jewfish they are not for pees and they are not really voices for piece or jewfish voices none of that is true s there of when when she suggests again that narrative is the most dangerous narrative and its a narrative that threatens the entire west this what people say why should i care about what is going on far away i get it i do i understand why should you care what is going o but its not going on faraway it is going on in your shores audit butler is a famous america academic her work is taught all over the united states in gender theory classes try your children hern tire philosophy has been main lined into the educational system not just with regarded gender but with regard to values as a whole the post modernist notion that all morality is effectively constructed but there is a victim and a victimizer another victimizer is always the successful person and the victim is always the failure and that's because the system that self is bad that is how you and up with gender queer non conforming ruth butler on the same side as common would gladly chop off her head in a moment were should be placed into the gosistrip now they probably would not chop offer edges they know that she is wonderful useful idiot for them if they who she was they would proper up because of course she is very useful to them but if they no idea just wandered ans the strip should look any other jewfish let be in non conformist left winger and they would chop off her head right away has but be yen's understand why the alines exists the since exists and it is a danger to the west it is not just a danger to israel its a danger to the least they are millions of people who believe the soft or form of what she is saying and the left his patted this on the head the left has in bite from this well his the difference in the old school democratic liberals and the far left burned sanders wing that s taking over the democratic party hand's all part of the piece it is all part of a broader whole cloth rewriting of morality see typical when you speak of judo christian morality you mean the any given situation we can determine whether somebody is a victim or victimizer by whether they are in fact a victim or a victimizer have they done something wrong have they done something that violates morality have they done something at violates moral scruples and rules but that but identity is victim or victimizer according to the left and the best way to tell whether somebodies victim for victimizer is whether they stand on behalf of the system and success within the system means your purveyor of the system the system is bat the fundamental premise of all left wing coalitional thought its that the system is bad and must be torn down and comoskan end up on the same side as queers for palisign even if they would kill each other given the first available opportunity it is the coalition that matter is whole alias it is the thing that matter's more than anything else the system has to be torn down and son we talk about all these issues that seem utterly dis connected training of the cads and support for compass yeast to wonder how they about the same side the answer is both want to thrown judo christian moral values that is what they are about and when you see a symptom of that crop of in the moral and bivolencs about is real commons that is a symptom of a much broader malty and treating that symptom in isolation as thought as nothing to do with the underlying malady means that them the malady is going to get worse it is going to matastocize they give a symptom of cancer and just treat the symptom but you pay no attention of the cancer you are going to die of the cancer that is the less right now the bear left wings support of commons is in a making indicator of jest how deeply rooted the cancer of radical left thought has gone and really has gone quite deep now speaking of the cancer of left wing thought there is a video that's ben making around yesterday and get in demonstrates just how far left town talk can prefer people in destroy their live it is a mother who is talking about all for of her children being trains this statistically in possible it is almost literally styttystically impossible meaning they your chances of a child suffering from gender dis fora are one and several causal the chance of four children suffering from gender dis forgo we're hung about one in hundreds of millions or billions and yet magically this mother came up with for transkan it is not munch cousin seldom by proxy it is not teaching your fades o munch of absolute garbage that is going to wreck their like and condemn them to a future of depression anxiety self hatred and self loathing no it is all chest it is it is all just being free it is all just natural and free and must be real it is an it is an act of resistance bringing your kit up in this way is an act of resistance to the gender system is gan all cyst ms are bad the systems have to be torn down here

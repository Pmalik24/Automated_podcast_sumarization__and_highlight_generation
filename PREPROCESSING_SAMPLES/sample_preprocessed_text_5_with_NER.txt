Well it is the end of the road for nickey haley the former you an ambassador under a donald trump former governor of south carolina she is droping out of the race to day because donald trum dominated supertuesday this of course was not a shok the onlhy question was why she was staying in because the REALITY was that every state EXCEP fer vermond TRUMP not only one he wont con vincingly in her home state of south carolina he beat her by oabout TWENTY point yo beat her sixty to forty in NORTH CAROLINA he beter seventy three to twenty three in VIRGINIA HE BETER sixty three to thirty for these are all perticularly virginia virgin is a moderate republican state tat is not a left wing republican state and an or rightwing republican state and he beat her very soundly in that state in CALIFORNIA he bee her seventy eight to eighteen what this suggests is that she really had no shot at the nomination after iwan KNO one had a shot at the nomination after iwa as i pointed out which you bi rondo santis dropped out early it is also whi nickey haley then stated in in te hope that SHOULD WIN NEW HAMPSHIRE she did not win new hampshire she over fom a little bit and then she stated in pass that mainly twi think put up a flag to the rest of the republican party that SHOULD TRUMP lose in NOVEMBER SHE WILL BE THE leader of the oposition ready to come in and take over i think that to miss reed of how re publicans think of donal trump i think that even if donald trump loses in NOVEMBER in the general election she jobidon it is very unlikely tha THE REPUBLICAN PARTY is then going to swivel and turne to nickey haly a specially because nickey haley seems to making the same the stake that is had crews made in twenty sucseen after losing the primaries to donald trump you will recall that thad cruwse than went to THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION and he said vote your conscience instead of just in dorsing trump he is ot of left it up in the air pleasing no one he suggested to the TRUMP voters thand maybe he was not support of of trump and' to the not trump voters at maybe he was support of of trump an heans t up winning no backing because of that nickey haley seems to be playing the same game which does not seem perticularly politically smart to me it is ONE thing ver nickey haleytsat i am staying in is an alternative to trump becas i think that he is going to lose but now that he is the nominate he is the nominy for herd os sit outside and not in dorse trump seems to me a a bit of political mou practice according to the walstry trurnal hailey plans to ouspen her republican presiden trall primary bid in a speech on wdnestay the former south carolina governor and you an ambassador is expected to makan appearance to deliver brief o mar remarks around TEN AM eastern her sision rive the day after super tuesdaysio one only vermont among the FIFTEENSDAYS on VERMONT is basically candida she is not going to announce an INDORSEMENT on WEDNESDAY however she is going to encourage donald trump to earn the support of republicans and independent voters who have backed her which presumbly could theoratically be if i i vice presidential play may be she is hoping that he picks her as sort of a unity ticket bot given his dominant performente in the primaryes very unlikely this ploing tat he feels the necessity to do that bot of asgan a turn toward who he actuay does pick for his v p the're a lot of people whof ben mention ranging from jady vanc the senter from OHIO to TIM scott the senator frum SOUTH CAROLINA we will have to wait and se donal trump for his part delivered a super tuesday victory speech in which he triumphally proplaimed that he was the nominy which of course hase been true basically since ivel once you one i what the thing was over awe

wall street are completely out of wack an probably were experiencing o bubble on that dout jones industrial average in the york stock is change for example donal trumpet then went on to rip jobidon on migrant crimaga he is doing the right thing in this victory speech which JUS put all the focas on JOBIDON if this ins hir campan is about tou bidn't tobidon is not going to win trump i think knows

to they were getting weld fom vens way li can you believe it again he is not wrong about any of this sort of stuff now the exit polls for republicans showe that their top issue was imigration which is not a surprise because it is in fact the top issue in the country right now even according to much of the polling data for the general american population the REALITY is that emigration is a top issue because people are looking at the insane amount to be legal imigration under jobt yur tong about AT LEAST SEVEN MILLION people have entered the contry legally while JOBIDON has been president mayalway be awept to TEN milling we literal have no idea and people see that as a crisis because it is in fact a crisis o the exipols showed that was the top issue for republicans now very often when you take ecipols people will say the economy but that is always thague nobody actun knows with that means i have seen re publican primary people are going to pick the issue that is themost polorized issue because their voting republican ats not a shock thair picking i migration but the REALITY is tht according to a puw research cents ar survey taken just last month it shows that emigration is a top issiue for a huge majority of americans dealng with emigration fifty SEVEN per cent of americans say tht that to be the top priority THIS YEAR is dealing with illegal emigration when it comes demigration joby is twenty points under water this of course is leading democrats down a real rabbit hole here they have TWO choices that hung the moderate on emigration or they can pretend thant voters are out of their minds obviously they are gon to do what you thing thing on to do thet obviously going to pretend the voters are crazy and out of their minds last night on emisan be se after the ecit polling came out showing republicans care bot emigration tdemocrats GENSOKI WHOS the former presecretary for JOBIDON we are mocking republicans for carring about emigration and if you look at for te t epulte in in virdaga inmi gration was the t c cta inin pe toa porder wit wes fortt wa a or maybe people are worried that he legal emigrants are going to show up where they live and might commict crimes or may be they are worried about the vast cultural changes that could be wrought by importing MILLIONS of people who have no familiarity with american concepts of things freespeege and property rihts or maybe they are simply worried about the fact that you are generating in entire economic under class of people many of WHOM will be dependent a WELFARE benefits and many of WHOM are going t be lowering the wage basin the ly there a lot of reasons why people in virginia might be worried about illegal emigration and again democrts are disconnected from this issue this is the issue among the issues tha pew surveys in which there is the biggest gap bettween how demicrats think and HOW INDEPENDENS THIN FORGET about publicans independents cording TWO the polling data from puw thirty nine per cent of demicrats believe that emigration is a real concern compared to fifty seven percent of independents in seventy six per cent of re publicans that is a high number of independents who are deeply worried about emigration and thet numbers up from FIFTY THREE percents in TWENTY TWENTY THREE and forty nine per cents in TWENTY TWENTY TWO DEMOCRATS meanwhile still stock down in the middorities on this thing when it comes to poblicy goals again in dependents look more republicans on a lot of these issues than they wiok demicrats on a lout of these issues that is a problem for the democrats THE WHITE HOUSE because they are stuck as i have been saying in this legsy media echochamber in which the idea for them is doubled down on the bayes they are ignoring all this to THE WHITE HOUSE yesterday for example they were asked about lacan rilyes murder wlhey can rily of course with theyoung woman who is killed the university of georgia by NILEGAL emigrant and THE WHITE HOUSE tried toblings onel from for that that dog is not going to hunt the president of THE UNITED STATES is JOBIDON he needs to close the bordern everybody knows it well rers thet by public we we araes murwewehande we e e we r erwe wan to always always be sure that we let lift up the families a lost theyr lents in that way i would be re mist ifi did not continue to say that republicans o procected a by parti cen proposal that came out of the senat and they truly truly cared about what was going on at the bord if they truly cared about the emicration o says and trying to fix that trying to mo for it in a step and awayed where we have a TOUGH and FAIR law they would work with US on it they would listen to the former president who is clearly telling them to rejeck telling republicans to rejected for there for his own political cane a gant if they thing this is a winning politiclargment ther out of their minds and this again goes to the reality of to day's modern politics an that is everending the medias con minced that the right wing has gone crazy and he going too far right in ter picking crazy candidates an there is some truth to that who coul the last round of senatorial races s republicans picked amon to terrible candidates and abongh of winable races n then they lost those races but democrats are now doing the same thing we now have a game of chicken ind which both sides have decided to put the RATICAL brick on the on the ACCELERATOR and then just AIM the cars at each other and the question is who is going to pullaway firs before the cars crash whoever pulls way FIRST in this case actually winds iy is not as though if you just continue along that path an theother got ples away u win it is the oposite in fact basicaly this game of chicken is both cars are aimed at THE CLIFF WICH SIDE IS GOING THO STOP BEFORE THE CLIFF AT all for get about close to te ad who ise gin astop at all the reason i point this out is BO cause YESTERDAY curston sinima the SENATOR from arizona who started off as a DEMOCRAT and then governed as a moderae democrat in what is a moderate purple state purple arizona is a purple state it was largely red state had A STATE ASSEMBLY and a state legislator that stat senate that were WBOTH were publican with dug ducy arizona governor as theirepublican until just very recently and then the arizon republican party decided they ware going to shoot themselves to rectly in the chast by embracsing every form of election questioning they possibly could alienating every moderate in the entire state and electing TWO DEMOCRATIC senators and a DEMOCRATIC governor KADY HOBS whos whet dish rag over in ARIZONA now the PROBLEM is that the under ling political caracter of the state of arizon a romanes purple there is a reson why un til very recently both senators were purple to red senators it was it was jon mac caine until he passed away and jaflake until donal trump basically destroyed him and THOS were both wre place by DEMOCRATS and the democrats wo re place them have had to govern from quasy the middle from mark kelly whos one of the senators he is atempted to govern as sort of ate bluish purple democrap curston SENTIMA WHOIS purple the sheeventually just went purple in decided to eclare herself in in dependent but then she decided not to run for reelection because THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BASICALLY CASTER OUT and they decided to primary herso instead of just having curston sinima be in INDEPENENT burniy standers who caucuses with the democrats which is what curston SENTIMA WOULD do thet in trustor enough tey decided to run against her reuben gaigo who is a far leftist in ARIZONA and the poles were showing a pretty even three ways split with curston SENTIMA in the rays he had THE ENTIRE DEMOCRATIC PARTY behind giego there is an emerson college pulling hill survey at was taken just a couple of weeksago and in found the reuben gaiego had thirty SIX per cent support thirty per cent for carylak the re publican nominy for the SENATE and TWENTY ONE per sent for curston sentima thirteen per cent undecided AD SO curston SENTIMA LOOKED at that democrats coul have EASILY dominated this race if they a just set o if ine ronocon a run against curston senima we understand sheson and penibichism pockas thus whir its kan a stay out she easily wins reelection in arizonis topree popular sender but they decided not to do that and to now theyare basically gettng rid of her in favor of rubin gaiego whih makes their race actually significantly hadr has gayago is not in THE MAIN STREAM OF ARIZONA politics according to the WALSTERTURNAL SENAMUS THAD SHOU will not run for reelection and were retire after this term and in for now the political run of whne of congress is most productive and controversial lawmakers a sentris who forge by partizan deals while also regularly an gring progress of democrats this it differenthing by the way then republicans basically saying to met romnetes time foree to go THE REASON THOT DIFFRENCIS CAUSE YOU TAUGHT IS A DEEP RED STATE YOU TUGH IS A BLOOD RED STATE ARIZONA is a purple state and for democrats to get rid of a purple senator who is going to caucus with them in favor of a far left candidate gayego i's really a fascinating turn of a vens now if only re publicans had nominated some one who for example had not run for governor and lost in tan claim that cho on for THE LAST YEAR and a half a gat that might that MIGHT BET NIGHT but they did not do that they ran carry lake instead it is carry verses reuben giego clash of the titans over in arizona demonstrating once more who ever seizes THE MIDDLE GROUND IS GOING TO WIN THESE ELECTIONS but both parties in some cases seemd to be runng away from MIDDLE GROUND ironically in the presan entual race it is jo bidon whos running away from THE MIDDLE GROUND and DOEL TRUMP whos reaching over and grabbing it weardly enough but many of the state races TRUMP is on has been rad as a super right wing mad ca mago very far extreme as right moment and a lot of people being nominator are people who are also abandoning the middle which is not smart see the dirty secret have been saying about donal TRUMP is that he is politically moderates and RETORICALLY extreme and many of the people whave ben running aure politically eextreme and RETORICALLY extreme which jis not what amaricans are superinto and by the way even retorically extreme only works ornonal trump it really is not work for anyone else donal trump is a ONE of ONE in the same way the brocoboma for democrats was a ONE of ONE you cannot be TRUMP there is no one who can out trump trump te's nobodywho can even be in that sime catigory trump is a stand up comedian who became president of THE UN TED STATES because he is extraordinarily entertaining he is camra magnetic he is always funny thinke all those things oure things that no other politician can hold that candal to because hes inae completely different category he is an an entertainer who became a politician not a politishian trying to be an entertainer in any case crston sent m a being alsted from the emocratic party in then retiring means that democrats are also alsting the people who are sopposedly reaching to the mol now to be fairer to the democrafts with her out of the race i had to have matchep between diago and lake shows the giagoes lead actually expands to SEVEN points forty six of thirty nine with fifteen per cent undecided lake is can have to reach out toe mettal if she wants to win that race but for his par burnystanders is TRIUMPHALIST about this burney sanders on the far left ofthe partye the yal we are dragging the entire party fart ofthe left tro the for a reherstalday a there is a ono setudar curson SENOLA anolse that she will not be seeking reelection this fall aaa ha hy a halot of ceglogon o misser are you ahaaha lus r lo glon him misser not e grani person i says says the crazed old goothball socialist but that is THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY they have decided theye ina cater to the burning wing of the party rather than the crsan cinimaling in the party jobidon ranis CRISTEN sintima and governn is burnysanders which is ACTUALLY a really bad strategy which means that he has kind of one final opportunity to put a new face on his presidency that of course s going happen this week with his state of the union address as political points out the state of the union may be ONE most vastly overited speeches an all politic ben not THIS YEAR the address jobidn setidaliveround thursday night will come as the president faces intensifying words about his age and VITALITY and OW host of confounding international prices in do mestic challenges that backdrop has dramatically highten the states for THE WHITE HOUSE with MILLIONS of yiewers turning in it not just to hear the words yutters but how he physically delivers them and this of course is the key the key is not to the state of te union whether JOBIDON says anything memorable when isthe last time a president said anything memorable durin a state of the union addressed at all terrible state of TH UNION addresses i hate them i hae hem every single year oucar who the president is or of what party they are manarcic spectacle in which the other branches of the american government are expected to treat the president as though he is an emperor the state of the union was suppose to be a letter issued from the president to t he legislature giving them an opdate on things that we are going on becaus government was originally really small and then it is trurned into thes pathetic impurial spectacle in which the president walks in and everbody cheers for him and kiss the r it is just ridiculous is ridiculous stupid thing i hate it every single year it is stupid got it is particularly stupid when you have a president jobiden oas to be weeled in on a gurning in order to make the statemen but it will be entertaining THIS YEAR as i have been saying for a long time since jobin to the presidency watching jobiden speak is in fact quite exciting not th what he thinks it is but's very exciting 's exciting because it is washing the llander brothers right you are watching somebody crossi tight robe in windy weather above volcano and when jobden speaks the big question is not going to be how how well does he do its how badly he will do there is no world in which you walks out and he is super care is matic and absolutely fascinating as s retorically shocking shot i j somebody who you look at NUA WAL that isn'n inspirational figure the question for jobiden is whether he is going to physically collapse on stage obviously will be covering this over at daily wireback stage wring be covering atlive TOMORROW nights make sure the USUNIN over it daily wire to come for that but the big question is going to be wether JOBIDON PHYSICALLY survives the speech which means the EXPECTATIONS are quite low it also means unfortunately for him that again the moref isability people get of jobidon the less they him jobidon yesterdayc was ast how he things he'is doing in the race and he said i am winning no ai erg w m wor a a a or pite paper n and then's mostman is cery moment for him because it lurking in the background is his worst nightmare stairs im but iw'll also points out o this pointod that is notro alf the last five polls that have been taking he is losing in THREE of them the only ones where he is woning heis inside the margin of errar those to be morning consult and sipe py in birtually everypoe before that he is losing that is not true also again one of the reasons he is losing is because he is no longer with US or yesterday whos ing a press conferents and he does this weird thing where he says the stage directions out loud wher in if geverbendo played their stage directions and the stage rections exit stage LEFT BU can what jobidon reads that lik hill sort of just read the stage directions lubic i nows time to takes i better notquestions agacenstage la jobi now here he go ien no struck you crutios orin toble with ONE preside ASI y at he breathes every brath could be a dafth rattle my goodness pics up the maeropon ts tie beater not take questions or pe bokin he neds the dart vater suit i this is that this this bad guis it is it is just not good and then non he said yesterday that his stafflood drop him a note when it was drop thad time unfortunate language for the barely sentien president withthot i am returne istover the WAL th direc o nano cin on consel but it post to lieve for me it mae e BUSINESS OTE on telepon but i am one h hann round an ta i wit you are pron misn i to state youan o my mystaf to toi mon ta ta o curs as e no what was thad what in the world's that m a ON CO ON THE ON THE RODERI an mi en a stik roun is i that is oki i he putn about that okga the thing he actually campaign in YESTERDAY all thathes can being ridiculously he not but the thing he actually campaign on o not getting him is shrink flation he believes that he is going to be able to plon off he is poor you canomic record on in flation on the greed of corporations that ar putting less in the potato chit bad an charging the same ount o money which is his fault in flation is your fault you are the president in flation began when you entered office my friend but here he was yesterday but he was not his tongue out shrank flation which again wa that that is can be a hell of a campaign slungin o JO i NA merifi shrink flation he i i swear he sounds a castanza talking about shrinkage here except he is siting the cooky monster now the open question in this particular clep is whether jour bidn believes THE COOKY MONSTER TO BE A REAL THING BI whether the cooky mosters a sentient being who walks around on the EARTH and eats cookies here ye here is yor bidn quoting the cooky monster this is where we ar foks but in fact some of the small snack companies you will not i

rin en a monster shon up NOS on evre en e pot meae ana ah anyway he is everything's going well get ready for seventy TWO MINUTES at that to mour night who is come heng some strong stuff but it is a AGAINT is not just that he is sen oulass that he is bad thas he is bad he is bad at the presidenting the most obvious the most obvious placewher he is bad at the presidenting right now is in the entire conflagration between ISRAEL and comass THE UNITED STATES has continues proive material support to ISRAEL but RETORICALLY THEYVE BEN under cutting israel at every possible turn in their battle against the genicitle terragroup andtheyve beendeclaring that isration negotiate with this genicitle terrigroup who COLONELLY holds SIX american cinisen tostage by the way among he ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY four hostages we do not nohomany our alive and come os ays they do not know how many our live which is a mazing a got o say come off they are in credible a counting bodies but THEY'VE no idea howmany hostages are alive a bom hats and FIVE SECONDS LATER IT'S twenty seven thousand two hundred and TWENTY ONE people have been killed all of them children and all of them poets and then thli sure you kowts been THREE ND HALF mons since we took a HUNDRED tirty for hot we have no idea how many ofthose people are alive weard how your counting skills why old leada grade the menut the we are talking about the people who you are keeping in captivity and raping re ROUTINELY PRESUMABLY the by DMINISTRATION has taken the retorical side of commoss by pro claiming a moral equivalence he heare's the thing when you proclaime a moral equivalence between a murderer and the person that person is trying to murder between the murderer and the victim youare siding with the murder if you say hey holl up here we have OJE and here we have not call and sure sre nicol is own the floor bleeding an sure n coll has rtes o self defence if she stole alive but let us be real there ave been mistakes made on all sides youre taking the side of oje at that point and that is what thy by NIMISTRATION has been doing retorically which again is the worst thing they can do because if you grand in ioda of retorical sympathy to terris they are going to pushu they are going to realize that they now have leverage over you and that is what commosrealizes the number of wies this ad ministration has either fallen for or told themselves on behalf of comos is insane at this point ' for example we have been hearing that ISRAEL we will not ship in aid that is not true israel alawsin HUNDREDS of a trcks every single that but there is no one to distributhiade you want to know why there' knowin to distribute theate in the gosistrip perhaps because commass hi jacks the trucks you are as tape of commas riding a round on the atrucks this is from yesterday you see that these are atrucks there are TWO members of commas on top of each one of these atrucks these are all civilionswho are standing the're being whereis my damned food and the answer is commass is stealing all of its and then the by deminstrations WHATERFULLY S in the mor i sethin is railiary mean about it comms is stealing the aid andtheyre killing people whoare trying to get the aid it is totally insane for then israel get's plane retoreclesa israel needs to do more says the bide administration meanwhile to bie yesterday says we need a sease fire becas of romadon ok get i am sorry this bull hasked to stop what what its it is RI DICULOUS this is such ridiculous nonsense romedon i's very holy holiday to the terroris whare willing to literally violate every single other human beings religious scruples on romadon everybody has to go real easy cause people are fasting between son rise in sunset thot go reall easy becaus it' turns out terras they love them ther romadon in a commas land over here thet be easy on them becaus obviously these are people we have to respect their religious scruples that dictate that they should murder pretty much everybody who is not a religious muslin makes perfect tense these obviousy they of demonstrated enormous enormous credi bilin yuwhen it comes to respect for othe religions for EXEMPLE when the palistinian arabs we are in CHARGE OF THE HOLY SITES jews cannot get in in fact its JUS tried to WORSHIP at their own holy sites when the estate of israel did not exist for templed western wall jrian't riots would starlike in NINETEEN twenty nine and HUNDREDS of jews would be murdered sobvies lith it lisen if there is ONE thing that the radical muslen world is known for its respect for othe religions which is why they literally blow up churches an build moson top of them or go directly on top of the temple amount and PUT the dome of the rock directly on top of the jewish holy of holies from THE TEMPLE TIT'S also why they go to hinducites in INDIA blow up the inducides ton put amskon top because if they are again when weare talig bout colonialists religions folks there is one that WINDS AE the most colonialis religion of all time is is lom a but that does not's the're cant be moderat muslems they are just not in COMMOSLAN they are many modera musle i know somatera muslims o people who do not actually believe in the COLONIAL legacy of sha real law but to pretend that romadon is is that is the desiding factor in whether ISRAEL should be able to go and tried to take back at TOSTAGES and KILL TERRAS is TOTALLY insane again thdemonstrating once again radical muslim simpathy for othe religions the lass TWO majors surprise wars it lwanched israel werl wanchd on RESPECTIVELY the YON yoon't kep lord the holyestanduish calender and intheteny thry and sim cottora which was ot toberseven som cout to ri is the happyesdate in the jewish calender an nals ime to bishabat s a double holiday for jews perfect time for commas to respect the religion and palsing ins villings involved s respect to religion of the JEWS by killing twelve hundred of them and BOUT but jobynsic romedons coming got be careful abyu rot it honestly this it is it is stupid it is stupid the'r not winning hearts and mines by trying to get a sease fire on behalf of terroris crups for romadon whose whose whispering in JOE's ear who believes this or is JOE JUS believe this in his attle brain obvious eas f oma eroma iar oh you mean you all you mean that there will be act acts of rioting on the temple mount there is every single year and HEN YOU'LL blame the JEWS for the acts of riting by the muslims on the temple amount iv ben up theire by the WAY and h uslen world than sugjestanim quot un quote traspassing or invading at the temple amount by which they mean i walk around it that is they mean you are literlly barred from praying on the temple amount by THE ISLOMIC WALC long as youre a you or i cristion by the way yheur muslem madn be up the'r playing sokar needing c donnals which is literally what happens on the templemoun theres literally a school in the corner of the temple amount this very holy sihe to muslims were kids are playing soker an flying KITES ya i in any case this is stupid but what what exactly tos meso by aministration they are pursuing a sease fire and commass ise rejecting every sease fire commas literally rejected the last sease fire offer that is seas fire offer was at and alfer for a six week seas fire in return for leasing the remaining female hostages and COMMS rejected it outright according to then your time president bidns had tuesday talks ON A POSSIBLE SIX wee seas firing goza are in the hands of commosrate now he spoke just before commosleater in LEBANON appeared to reject a proposed deal thouus is backing insisting is reailly hostages would be released only AFTERA seas fire was in place and is rally forces have withdrawn commoss knows they are in control because bidin wants the seas firer more thn he wants is real to strikomoss that is just the bottom line here and because of that bidon is now shifting his lying to mirror commos according to i twenty for news while holding out for comos to accept to seas firein hostage release proposal you ust an ARAB negotiers floated a potential short paust hostilities while the larger youll gets ironed outs wal wout that mean that thout mean calling for a seas fire without any hostages being released which is called loosing is thindes railers igan go for that smostin sene stupidity ever it is ri diculously insane and the media and the political class though i got will the sy becaus JO BIDON duns an get along with beeby this has nothing to do with jobidn an baby beny gons just visited WASHINGTON tes he got the same exectreatment from commel herris and trobidon one ofthe great lies of forein policy is that foreign policy is constructed bast on individual likes and this likes of the leaders of countries it is not is bast on the individual interests of countries an does not matter very much weth you or dislike of landmer pooten or wethryou get along with him or not what matters is whether his interests are actually in coincidents with your own and the same thing holds truth is raily leaders or a PALISTINIAN leaders we ought to be absolutely clear and gimblet eyed about the question of a merican national interest and THE NATIONAL INTEREST OF OTHER countries and this bizar notion that america has some sort of dis agreement with beaving itong ou personally and there fore theyfe to makes him sort a consessions to commss it is absolute stupidity meanwhile by the way heron is activating all its prockies they know thy'v got a wit thevu they have a fish on the line and that fish is the bid administration his BALLA has ben heating up because they know that jobine onts one thing above all and that is a ceas fire in the region and they are rationing up then militory action in the attempt to gain concessions vea THE UNITED STATES from the is railies yesterday from NAMPLE ces bala launch fifty ROCKETS into the north of his re now

the ratical base of th democratic pary is pushing jobidn to less and GAND it is most obvios on a couple of ishis emigration is ONE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY COULD easily cut EIGHT deal with republicans or just inact executive orders in ORERSHUTS on the BOARDER and the're not doing it because theire hock t thei radical base you nals o see it most clearly with regard to ISRAEL in CHOMAS is the most morally obvious conflict in modern history it is between a democratic state that was literally just attacked wit t worst terror attacks ins tine eleven in the west and a GENICIDALE TERRO GROUP that is holding hostages right no and suddenly the left os the wile i dont knw about that is it is pretty it is pretty convoluted it is pretty i do not know what i would do is why you get morons NIT cristofit than your times a moral moral DUNCE suggesting what i get this question regularly and i acknowledge that israel face to diffical challenge it was hard to taring comass without risking civilians my answer is what i would not to is killed THIRTY ONE thousand people in van coover and cluding twelve thousand FIVE HUNDRED childern an starve the ENTIRE population the question was imagin terristrocats fired from VAN COUVER AN TO PORTLAND ORIGAN what would you do a but you did not answer the question syour question is i wouln't do what theis raillies would do but i will sit here and all pontificatelien giant gjack asked this is the left is the left ry now s left has decided that basically if you are evil enough this means you earn a free ticket to LEFT WINGLAND IT'S grat if your evil enough this suggest that your victimized see in the victim victim victimizer narrative the oppressor oppressed narrative who ever is the worst is considered the oppressed because remember yef the link that up with the left wing idea that every one who acts badly is doing because of childwhood drama and people being means o them that people are naturally good and naturally kind and NATURALLY wonderful and therefore if somebody blows themself up in a cafen they take a mon she kids with them then that is probably because they had a really rough childhood and they are the victim not the victimizer thay are the victim the worst you act the more evil you are the more you have been victimized by outside forces and thus youre actual victims are the victimizers complete reversal victim an VICTIMIZER most obvious example of this is judith butlers the yuth butler is ONE of most damaging academics of the last sixty years she is famously a founder of queer theory she is a person who became famous by suggesting that all of gender is a social construct there is no linkage whatsoever between your biology and your behavior it is all social construct she says that the body itself is a social construct that is defined is all about power she says that gender itself is a verb that constructs it is a performance everything is performative and GENDER is a quot struggle to reworke on orms fyt which BODIES AR EXPERIENCE O FOR MOST OF HER LIFE SHE CONCERTD HERSELF WOMAN now she says thanks to gender non binaring nonsense that she helps create she is a thy then but she is religious ta crazy lady and this crazy lady who is RESPECTID NACANAMIC saricles because she rates absolute tortid gobledy gook that makes no sense to any one with a sentient prefruntal quartect this told is not just a mor on when it comes to gender a theory and her bizar notions that GENDER is entirely constructed and made up in all the rest of this darvage but thatlinks up with her bely that terrer is are nonfecterise she was talking about these situationwas HAN israel and commass the other day and she decided to lay down a theory her theory is that OCTOBER seven which involved the mass rape of women the murder of men women the slaughter of children the beheading of foreigners and jews the kidnapping of women and re peated rape of those women that all of that was just an act of resistance cause after all yeft understandth what we are watchg right now is the coalition of the seudo oppressed to ave decided that any system in which they are un successful they are the victims and therefore they can do what ever they want when you link up that oppressor oppressed narrative in which everybody who is a failur has been oppressed in some way everybody who is evil has ben a pressed in some way you linkd that up whit the friends fa non notion that resistance can come in any form and that is how you and up with judith butler one MOST EVIL HUMAN BEINGS OF THE last sixty years sure she was yesterday justifying comass we can have different vus about hamos as a political party we can have different youon canlyabout o arm arm to resistance but i tink is u more onest and historically correct to say that the ukrize thing of out tober seventh as an act of armed resistance it is not a terrise attack and itsnot an amtisimitic a tack it was an attack i agunst is reallyis and i didnot that attack i i have gone public with this i hav gotten an trouble for sang it to you DN'T it it went all fom me anguisshing it was anguishing it was oly hy l however o made her find may verian iglish however if i then decited that the only violence in the scene was the violent stung to is really people the violent stun to poustinience has been happening for decates this was an upprising that comes out e thet comes from a stateof a subjugation and a ance o filent state aporahus oh as as supposed to comass which is not a violend state apparatus or RON which is not a violent state apparatus it is the democratic state of isral whch has twenty PER CENT arab citizenry that is the the violen state apparatus according to this absolutely ridiculous piece of filf in shis TRULY one o the worst people on the planet truly an offu cmumping by the way she work she she says that shes assoso a jewish voices for piece the best thing bout jewish voices for piece is the only actual word in that title that is true is of they are not jewish they are not for pees and theye are not really voices for piece or jewish voices none of that is true s the're of when when she suggests aagain that narrative is the most dangerous narrative and its a narrative that threatens te entire west this what people say why should i care about what is going on far away i get it i do i understand why should you care what is going o but its not going on faraway it is going on in your shores judith butler is a famous american academic her work is taught all over THE UNITED STATES in gendera theory classes tru your children hern tire philosophy has been main lined into the educational system not just with regarded gender but with regard to values as a whole the POST modernist notion that all morality is effectively constructed but there is a victim and a victimizer andthe VICTIMIZER is ALWAYS the successful person and the victim is always the FAILUR ND THA'S becaus the system that self is bad that is how you and up with gender queer non conforming juth butler on the same side as commos whoould gladly chop off her head in a moment were should be placed into the gosistrip now they probably would not chop offer edbes they know that she is wonderful useful idiot fror them if they who she was they would proper up because of course she is very useful to them but if they no idea sjust wandered ans the gostrip should look any other jewish les be in non conformist left winger and they would chop off her head right away haso but be YEV'S understand why the alines exists the lionce exists and it is a danger to the west it is not just a danger to israel its a danger to the lesst they are MILLIONS of people who believe the soft or form of what she is saying and the left his patted this on the head the left has in bibe from this well his the difference in the old school democratic liberals and the far left burney sanders wing that s taking over THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY and's all part of the piece it is all part of a brougder whole cloth rewriting of morality see typicaly when you speak of judao christian morality you mean tht any given situation we can determine whether somebody is a victim or victimizer by whether they are in fact a victim or a victimizer have they done something wrong have they done something that violates morality have they done something at violates moral scruples and rules but that but IDENTITY is victem or victimizer according to the LEFT and the best way to tell whether somebodyies victim eor victimizer is whether they stand on behalf of the system and success within the system means your perveyor of the system the system is bat the fundomental premis of all left wing colitional thought its that the system is bad and must be torn down and comoskan end up on the same side as queers for palisign even if they would kill each other tgiven the FIRST available opportunity it is the coalition that matter is whober alis it is the thing that matter's more than anything else the system hass to be torn down and son we talp about all these issues that seem UTTERLY DIS CONNECTED LIKE TRANSING OF THE CADS and support for comass yetst to wonder how theyn aboun the same side the anser is both want to tardown judao CHRISTIAN moral values that is what they are about and when you see a symptem of that crop op in the moral and bivolencs about is ral commoss that is a symptem of a much brouder mality and treating that symptem in isolation as thougt as nothing to do with the underlying malady means that them the malady is going to get worse it is going to matastocize sthey give a symptem of cancer and just treat the SYMPTEM but you pay no attention of the cancer you are ging to die of the cancer that is the less right now the bezar LEFT WINGS support of commoss is in a mazing indicator of jest how deeply rooted the cancer of ratical left thought has gone and REALLY has gone quite deep now speaking of the cancer of left wing thought there is a vidyo tht's BEN making around yesterday and get in demonstrates just how far left toin talk can prever people in destroy their live it is a mother who is talking about all for of her children being trans this ISTATISTICALLY in possible it is almost literally styttystically impossible meaning they your chances of a child suffering from GENDER DIS FORIA are ONE and several tausan the chance of four children suffering from GENDER DIS FORIO TE'RE tung ABOUT ONE in hundreds of millions or billions and yet magically this mother came up with for transkan it is not munch housin sendrom by prosxy it is not teaching your kades o munch of absolute garbage that is going to wrect their lize and condemn them to a future of depression anxiety self hatred and self loathing no it is all cjest it is it is all just being free it is all just NATURAL and free and must be real it is an it is an act of resistance bringing your kit up in this way is an act of resystance to the gender system is GAN all syst ms are bad the systems have to be torn down here is the vidio of of mommy who is absolutely destroying lives for children the picture of a little boy whose dresses a girl in TWENTY TWENTY TWO our twin daughters came to US and told US they did not feel the genders they were given were TRULY them the're both boys our son told US he was transgender too that is a girl and our child told US they did not feel a boy or a girl four kids each gender non conforming has ungoo to parenting though and then and then hugging hugging your kids as they destroy their lives because you have endoctrinated them into this cult i trusted them and from THAT DAY on our family changed in the most beautiful way WAIT UNTILL he is kid tor twenty she she is hugging all of her all the kids she is she is absolutely destroying this a child abuse in childen dangerment and because shou be immediately sees besies by se pas i truste them and from that day our family changed this about mommy how doyou know because she is filming it and putting it on the tiktocks that is how when ever parents film themselves with ter kids tung baut wonderful parents there BECUS TEY'RE SO tolerant diverse it is about parents people said we were craziless in them they are just kidsthey do not know who they are they do know you are crazy and you are wrecking children you are destroying children it is been TWO YEARS TO DAY and my children are thriving they are happy and free to be their trueselves i have a feeling that if they were not happy they you are never can find out about that for mommy since mommy is ONE

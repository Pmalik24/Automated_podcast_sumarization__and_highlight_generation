REMAIN IGNORANT UNTIL WE ARRIVE AT THAT MOMENT OURSELVES NANSY UP DIK FOUND A SPOT WIC SYOU COULD UNDERSTAND ALL THI BETTER HERE'S NESI BEFORE I TELL YOU WHERE I WENT LET ME TELL YOU WHY I WANTED TO GO FOUR YEARS AGO MY MOTHER'S HUSBAND SA WAS DYING SHE WAS TAKING CARE OF M IT HOME WITH HELP FROM A HOSPES AND I WENT TO BE WITH HER AND HIM FOR THE LAST TEN DAYS OF HIS LIFE HE WAS THIS TALL VERY FUNNY MAN WITH BEAUTIFUL MANNERS WHO ADORED MY MOTHER I FELT CLUMSY AND HELPLESS ALL THE TIME IN THOSE LAST DAYS WITH ASA WITH MY MAM I DIDN'TKNOW WHAT TO SAY TO SOME ONE WHO'S DYING I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO BE I'M SURE THAT'S TRUE FOR LOTS OF PEOPLE I REMEMBER CHECKING IN ON ASA ONE AFTERNOON AND ASKING HIM IF HE NEEDED ANY THING HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID I NEED EVERYTHING WE BOTH LAUGHED THAT WAS THE CLOSEST I EVER GOT TO TALKING WITH HIM ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENIRNG THERE WERE PEOPLE AROUND WHO DID KNOW WHAT TO DO THOUG THE NURSES I WATCHED THEM FROM MY STUPOR OF AWKWARDNESS THEY NEVER BROUGHT ANY FALSE CHEER INTO THE ROOM WITH ASA WHICH IS HARD NOT TO DO WITH THE DYING PERSON THEY WERE DIRECT WHEN JACKY THE WEEK AND DAY NURSE LEFT THE SUNDAY BEFORE ASA DIED SHE SAID TO HIM IS IT O PAY IF I KISS YOUR HAND AND THEN SHE SAID GOD WILLING I'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK THE NURSES KNEW HOW TO DEAL WITH US THE REST OF THE FAMILY TOO ONE OF THE NURSES JENNY GOT ME CLEANING OUT THE FRIDGE ONE MORNING WE DID IT TOGETHER FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF JUST TALKING PASSING THE TIME ITE WASN'T UNTIL LATER THAT I REALIZED OH SHE DID THAT FOR ME TO GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DO IT WAS A STRANGE FEELING TO KNOW I WAS THAT TRANSPARENT TO HER FOR THE LAST HOUR OF ASA'S LIFE THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM WERE MY MOTHER ONE OF ASA'S SONS JENNY AND ME WE HELD ASA'S HANDS JENNIY WAS STANDING AND SHE SOMETIMES TOUCHED ASA'S HEAD GENTLY SHE TOLD HIM IT'S ALL RIGHT IT'S O KA YOUR FAMILY IS O KAY EVERY ONE IS ALL RIGHT ASA'S EYES WERE OPEN THEY'D BEEN THAT WAY ALL DAY HE WAS STARING UP AND TO THE RIGHT OVER OUR HEADS HE DIDN'T SEE US HE MOANED EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE AND WE SPOKE TO HIM WHEN HE MOANED THE FOUR OF US WATCHED HIS BREATHING SLOW DOWN AND GET SHALLOWER UNTIL HE WAS TAKING JUST SIPS OF AIR WHEN HE WAS VERY CLOSE TO THE END JENNY BROUGHT OVER A GLASS OF WATER AND A LITTLE DROPPER THAT WE'D BEEN USING TO MOISTEN ASA'S MOW AND SHE TOLD US EACH TO TAKE THE DROPPER AND GIVE HIM SOME WATER AND SAY OUR NAMES CLOSE TO HIS YEAR SO THT HE WOULD KNOW WHO WAS GIVING HIM EACH BIT OF WATER AS A RITUAL IT FELT COMFORTING AND SAD AND VAGUELY RELIGIOUS AND ASA'S SON AND I WERE BOTH CRYING I HAD KNO IDEA HOW BADLY WE'D NEEDED A RITUAL AT THAT MOMENT UNTIL JENNIY GAVE US ONE I HAD NEVER SEEN THE KIND OF EXPER TEASTES NURSES HAD THEY KNEW DEATH THEY SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IT WHERE IS I EVEN THOUGH I HAD JUST TO WATCH SOME ONE FADE AWAY AND DIE GREAT IN FRONT OF ME ALL I COULD THINK WAS WHAT JUST HAPPENED BUT I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH BEHOLD ALL OF THIS HAD ON ME STILL UNTIL I HEARD A STRANGER TALKING A FEW MONTHS AGO ABOUT HOW HIS MOTHER IS A NURSE WHO WORKS IN A HOSPICE FACILITY SEEING PEOPLE DIE ALMOST EVERY DAY AND THEN HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT AFTER HIS MOTHER HAD WORKED THERE FOR A FEW MONTHS SHE FORGOT THE PRESIDENT'S NAME AND WHEN SHE MENTIONED THAT TO HER BOSS HER BOSS SAID YE THAT HAPPENS THAT'S NORMAL HERE YOUR BRAIN IS BLOCKING OUT A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEIME AND SOME OTHER STEP IS GETTING BLOCK TOO MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS MY GOD OF COURSE THEIR EXPERTS NOT ROBOTS MY SECOND THOUGHT WAS I NEED TO GO TO THIS PLACE AND TALKTONS BEOPLE  THIS GI WANT TO PASEEVER PASTTHIS MAON ON MY BEST BEHAVIOUR SO THIS IS PATTY BURNHAM SHE'S THE ONE WHO FORGOT THE PRESIDENT'S NAME THAT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO THOUGH SHE'S ON TOP OF IT NOW IT'S BROCK OBAMA BY THE WAY PATTY'S A REGISTERED NURSE AND THE PLACE SHE WORKS

LIKE SORT OF HE BACK ENTRANCE A GARAGE ENTRANCE AND THERE WERE TWO FENERAL HAM CARS PULLED UP THEY ARE WAITING AND OW I JUST SAT THE PARKING LATS SOR TO STARING AT THE HOUSE AND STARING AT THE CARS AND WONDERING WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE GOING OUT IN THAT BUILDI POSBIST CAN MEAN A BUILDING LIKE CAPLIN OR HOME CARE LIKE ASA HAD THEY BOTH MEAN THE SAME THING THE PATIENT IS NOT LOOKING TO BE CURED IT'S PALLIAT IVE CARE FOR PEOPLE AT THE END OF THEIR LIFE HE CAPLIN HOUSE ACTUALLY IS BEAUTIFUL ALL THE ROOMS HAVE BIG WINDOWS THE LOBBY AND MAN COLMINARIA HAVE VAULTED CEALINGS AN SCYLIGHTS NOTHING IS COVERED IN PLASTIC I OVERHEARD ONE FAMILY MEMBER OF A PATIENT SAY THE THING I LIKE ABOUT THIS PLACE IS THERE ISN'T A FONY PLANT IN HERE ALL THE FLOWERS AR REAL THERE'S A BIG KITCHEN FOR ANY PATIENTS WHO CAN STILI ET PATTY'S SPEED WALKS BY I NEED A FORCOT FOR ROOM FOR PLA FOR BANKYO THIS IS NOT JUST A PLACE FOR RICH PEOPLE WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE LOTS OF PATIENTS ARE ON METICARE OR METICATE  CAPLIN HOUSE IS RUN BY A NON PROFIT CALLED CARE DIMENTIONCE AND THE BULK OF WHAT THEY DO IS HOME CARE CAPLIN HOUSE HAS ROOMS FOR JUST TWENTY PATIENTS ATND I'S NOT FULL TO DAY BUT PATTY'S BUSY SHE RUSHES BETWEEN ROOMS AND THEN SLOWS DOWN AS SOON AS SHE STEPS INSIDE ONE DOES SHE LOOK COMFORTABLETIA WER PATTY'S TALKING TO CRISTEL THE DAUGHTER OF A FIFTY ONE YEAR OLD WOMAN NAMED LORRY WHO CAME TO CAPLIN HOUSE A FEW HOURS AGO SHE HAS LUNG CANCERTS MATASTASIZE TO HER BRAIN LORRY'S DELIRIOUS MAKING SOUNDS BUT NOT SPEAKING MUCH ANY MORE HER FAMILY'S BEEN TAKING CARE OF HER AT HOME THEY TELL PATTY THAT LORRY ALWAYS LIKE TO LOOK GOOD SHE HAS A PERFECT RED MANICURE AND PETICURE  YOU'VE BEEN TAKEN ONE NEW THE HOLE CARE SHE LUKS ME IN A  IF HE WAN A CHAT ABOUT ANYTHING F YE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MEDICATIONS HER LET'S GONE ON ERAN KNOW WE CAN STEP OUTSIDE ANY AND NOW WE MIGHT NOT HAVE ANY QUESTIONS NOW BUT THEY MIGHT COME OUT A I  THE QUESTIONS DO COME UP CRISTEL COMES AND FINDS PATTY AND SHE DOES SOMETHING I REMEMBER DOING CRISTELL STARTS OUT ASKING ABOUT ONE SMALL SPECIFIC THING TO TRY AND GET A HANDLE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING SHE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT IS THE TOBE THAT'S ON HER MOTHER'S FACES READ UNDER HER NOSE SHE ASKS SO QUIETLY IT'S HARD TO HEAR BUT SHE SAYS WHAT'S THE THING ON HER NOSE SHE SMELLS LIKE BLEECH N E TENY OR NOT NO IS WIT WY OT SUCH A THAT'S JUS TOCK E GEN YE THIS QUESTION BASICALLY WHAT IS THAT THING ON MY MOTHER'S FACE THAT IS MAKING HER LOOK AND SMELL LIK SHE'S NOT MY MOTHER THAT'S JUST THE FIRST IN A GYANT UNSORTED PILE OF QUESTIONSE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WHY AND WHAT MY S WAS TO BE DOING AND FEELING CRISTEL SAYS SOME OF THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS IN THE ROOM HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT NO ONE SHOULD TOUCH THERY NOT TO TOUCH HER ER YOU CAN TOUCH HER FROM THERE SHE TELLS PATTY IN ONE LONG CRYING SENTENCE THAT PEOPLE IN THE ROOM HAVE BEEN TELLING HER MOTHER THAT IT'S O CAY TO LET GO AND ONE OF THE TIME SOME ONE SAID IT HER MOTHER ALL THE SUDDEN SAID NO AND WHAT IS THAT MEANS SIND SHE'S DELIRIOUS AND SHOULD I BE SAYING IT'S SO CAY FOR HER TO LET GO AND SOME WAYS I WIS SHE WOULD LET GO SO SHE WOULDN'T SUFFER ANY MORE BUT I FEEL WEARD EVEN THINKING THAT AND MY MOND'S GOTTEN CLOSE TO THE END LIKE THIS A FEW TIMES BEFORE AND THAT SHE'S COME BACK AND MAYBE THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING AND SOME PEOPLE IN THE ROOM ARE SAYING YUGIS ARE DRUGGING HERSO THAT SHE'LL DIE FASTER AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ANY OF THIS I DON'T KNOW PATTY LISTENS TO THE WHOLE THING AND THEN JUMPSIN SO A LOT OF PEOPLE CRISTEL ASK THESE QUESTIONS WE ARE NOT DRUGGING HER TO PUT HER TO SLEEP I WOULDN'T DO THIS JOB IF THAT WAS THE CASE YOUR MA I'M SORRY TO SAYING IS DYING ANOR SHE HAS STORTED HER DYING PROCESSESS IS ONE EVERYTHING E'RE SEING IS PART OF THE DYING PROCESS E I KEEPS ERNURSEHE'S URE I SHE'S I IS LIK  FOR TIM AN A AND AN JUS ONDI WHAT SO THE THINGS IM SEEING THAT MAKES ME THINK THAT IT'S THIS TIME THIS IS THE TIME IS HER HEART IS BEATING REALLY REALLY FAST AND JUS SORT OF FLUTTERING LIKE YOU CAN'T FEEL OF GOOD STRONG PALL OUT HERE HER LEGS AND OUR HANDS ARE COLD HER FEET IT'S SHELLING A TELL TAL SING THAT WE SEE CALL MOTDLING WHERE THE FEET GET AND THE KNEES GET SORT OF DAPPLE LIKE LITTLE PURPLEISH MARKS AND IT JUST MEANS HER BODY'S CAN SERVING ALL HER BLOOD TO BE AROUND HERE I WOULD BET MY NURSING LICENSE THAT YOUR MOTHER IT'S NOT GOING TO TURN AROUND FROM THIS BUT IF HER BODY IS MEANT TO TURN AROUND IM NOT GIVING HER ANYTHING THAT WONE ALLOWER TO TURN ERT DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TOER I REMEMBER STANDING WITH MY MOTHER AND WHEN OF AS'S NURSES IN THE KITCHEN AND HAVING THIS CONVERSATION THAT THIS IS IT CONVERSATION THERE'S SO MANY STAGES TO A LONG DECLYINE DIPS AND MERSURGENCES AND GOOD DAYS AND YOU KNOW YOU KNOW IT'S ALL THE SAME THING IT'S ALL DYING BUT THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DYING AND THE VERY LAST PART OF DYING WAT PATTY AND THE OTHER NURSES CALL ACTIVELY DYING AT PROCESS THAT CAN TAKE HOURS OR EVEN DAYS BUT IT'S DIFFERENT FROM WHAT COMES BEFORE AND BEING FAMILIAR WITH ONE DOESN'T MANYO RECOGNIZE THE OTHER I TALKD TO PATTY LATER AND I ASKED HER HOW SHE KNOWS WHEN SOME ONE IS ACTIVELY DYING HOW DOES SHE KNOW IT' SO WELL THAT SHE WOULD SAY I BUT MY NURSING LICENSE THAT THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING I DON'T ALWAYS FEEL THAT WAY YET OU YE IT'S A WEIRD THING BECAUSE WHEN I CAME TO WORK AT THE CAPLIN HOUSE YOU KNOWN I WAS RISTER NURSE WORKED IS A NURSE FOR WHILE I I FOLLOWED ANOTHER NURSE JEANNETTE I'M FOR A MONTH AND I I WAS FLORED BY THE WHOLE DYING PROCESS CAUSE IT WAS NOTHING THAT I HAD LEARNED AND I SAWD JEANETTE SAY TO A FAMILY SHE WOKE THEM UP AND SAID HE'S DYING HE'S DYING RIGHT NOW AND THE MAN HAD BEEN THERE THE PATIENT HAD BEEN THERE FOR A WEEK AND I I I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS DIFFERENT I I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SAW THAT WAS DIFFERENT AND WHEN I ASKED HER TO EXPLAIN IT TO ME AND TO O TEACH IT TO ME SHE'S SAID YOU'LL NOW YOU JUST NEED ABOUT A MONTH HERE AND YOU'LL NOW I TALKED TO A PALLIATIVE CARE DOCTOR WHO TOLD ME THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING SHE GOT BETTER AT WITH EXPERIENCE WAS LOOKING FOR OPENINGS THAT ALLOW YOU TO BE HELPFUL LITTLE WINDOWS LITTLE MOMENTS WITH HOSPICE PART OF THAT IS TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE TAKE IN BIT BY BIT THE REALNESS OF WHAT'S HAPENING SOME DYING PEOPLE NO SURPRISE ARE NOT AT ALL OQET WITH THE FACT THAT THEIRE DYING AND THEY DON'T OFTEN GET A CHANCE TO JUST SAY SO I SAW A HOME CARE NURSE TALKING TO A MAN A FORMER MATH TEACHER IN HIS SIXTIS SHE WAS TALKING BOUT AUNTIE TO PRESSENCE ASKING HIM WHETHER HE WAS DEPRESSED HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND HE SAID WELL I'M NOT JUMP OUT THE WINDOW DEPRESSED MORE LIKE WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED ASON WAS A COURTLY MAN I NEVER HEARD HIM SWEAR OR EVEN SPEAK HARSHLY IN MY LIFE BUT I CAN TELL HOW FRUSTRATED HE WAS SOMETIMES BY THE SHEER LEGISTICS OF BEING A DYING PERSON THE IMPOSITION OF IT SOMETIMES JUST THE QUESTION DO YOU WANT THIS SEEMED OVERWHELMING DYING IS A CONSTANT SERIES OF JUDGMENT CALLS DECISIONS BASED ON OPTIONS THAT ARE VERY FAR FROM WHAT ANY ONE WOULD WANT AND ONE THING THE NURSES ARE EXPERIENCED AT IS TRYING TO MAKE THE BEST OF THOSE NARROW OPTIONS SHALL I AN IT IS NO BATHER FIRST OF ALL AND CHRISTIANA AN I RECKOND I DO IT TO GATHER I WENT LOVE TO GEVE YOU A SHOWER BEFORE YOUE HAD HOME PATTY'S CROUCHING NEXT TO A WOMAN NAMED JOANN WHO'S GOING HOME LATER TO DAY SHE HAS LONG CANCER AND SHE'S BEEN GETTING HOSPITAS CARE AT HOME BUT HER PAIN GOT WORSE SO SHE CAME TO THE CAPLIN HOUSE FOR A FE DAYS OF ROUND THE CLOCK SUPERVISION WHILE THE DOCTORS ADJUSTED HER PAINMENTICATIONS PEOPLE SOMETIMES COME IN AND OUT OF CAPLIN HOUSE LIKE THIS THEY'RE DYING BUT THEY STILL HAVE TIME LEFT IN THEIR LIVES AND THE STAFF TRIES TO GET THEIR SYMPTOMS UNDER CONTROL PAIN OR VOMINING OR WHATEVER IT IS SO THEY CAN DO MORE WITH THAT TIME THAN JUST BE SICK THIS ROOM SMELLS BAD IT'S STRONG JOANNE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO SHOWER IN A LITTLE WHILE SHE SAID SHE HAS A HARD TIME DOING IT AT HOME SHE'S TINY IN THE BED BARELY LOOKING UP TALKING ALMOST INAUDIBLY BUT HER STRENGTH OF WILL IS INTACT SHE KNOWS THE AMBULANCE CAN'T PICK HER UP AND TAKE HER HOME UNTIL LATER BUT SHE WANTS TO BE HOME NOW ALREADY AND ANYTHING ISN'T GOING HOME IS SOMETHING SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DO EVEN THOUGH A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO SHE WAS GLAD WHEN PATTY SUGGESTED A SHOWER BECAUSE IT'S MUCH EASIER TO DO HERE WHEN TWO PEOPLE CAN GET ON YOUR SIDE OF HER AND STEADY HER I JUST FEEL LIKE THE  SUCH A GREAT OPPORTUNITY CAUSE IT'S SO HARD TO DO AT HOME AND THERE'S TWO OF US HERE WHY CAN'T I CAN SOLL SHLL DOYOU DO THAT REGULARLY AT HOME OR IS IT HARD CAUSE YHOU MAME TO PEOPLE CAUSE YOU ARE TELLING ME O DON'T FEEL THAT SAFE WIT THE LEFT SIDE YEN AN I HEW AA WO OT IA ER THE BAR OLL ONTENS ON A BACK GROUND BA IND OH  OH  YE HELPS WEN YOUR PAYING LIKE A PUT SOME LOSION CAN WE WASH ABAT WANT I  HEAD INTO THE BATHRO AND YOU CAN SER TO SIT ON THIS IN THE BATH ROOM  A WHAT'S TO THAT MAYBE YOU CAN TELL WHERE PATTY'S GOING WITH THIS I'D SEEN HER TAKEN CARE OF JOANN AND OTHERS ALL DAY PEOPLE CLEARLY IN THE MIDST OF SOME OF THE WORST DAYS OF THEIR LIVES OT AFRAID IN PAIN SICK OF BEING SICK AND IT TAKES SERIOUS SKILLS TO BEABLE TO NUDGE SOMEBODY IN THAT SITUATION TOWARD A THING THAT THEY DON'T THINK THEY WANT BUT ARE VERY GLAD WHEN THEY GET IT CN WE TAKE YOUR PANTS DOWNS IF YOU CAN GET YOUR BACK SID ALL RIGHT I'S THAT A COMFORTABLE POSITION FOR YO SO ANN YOU DO KNOW WHAT GETTING PRETTY CLOSE TO A SHOWER YOU SURE YOU DON'T LOO AT LOOK AT HOW GO AHEAD W W JOAN'S HUSBAND LARRY HAD BEEN SITTING QUIETLY IN THE ROOM THIS WHOLE TIME HE DEGREED THAT A SHOWER WAS A GOD IDEA BUT HE DIDN'T WANT A PUSHJOAN ON IT AND THEN HE SEEMED HAPPY WHILE SHE DECIDED TO DO IT S ONCE SHE WAS IN BOTH HE AND JOANN RELAXED TO BIT IRITOAN JOKED AROUND WITH PATTY IN THE SHOWER AND LARRY GOT UP TO LEAVE AND GO HOME TO GET THE HOUSE READY FOR WHEN JOANN GOT BACK THEY'VE BEEN MARRIED TWENTY SEVEN YEARS DID DO WANT TO GIVEN A GROSRY LESS TOR ANYTHING TIE ETTLE HONEY DO LESS EFORE YOU GET THERE LA E LET  YOU TELLBON SOR A IHT WELL MAKE SURE TO GET THAT THERE'S A NOTE ON THE MEDICARE WEB SIGHT ABOUT HOSPIT SAYING HOSPICE ISN'T JUST FOR CANCER I SAW PEOPLE AT CAPLIN HOUSE WITH OTHER CONDITIONS AND STAGE DEMENTHA CONJEST OF HART FAILURE BUT MOSTLY I SAW CANCER ASAD CANSWER AT THE APLIN HOUSE I REALIZED I HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PHYSICAL PART OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED WITH HIM I SAW OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAD THAT EXTREME CANCER THINNESS I LEARNED THE MEDICAL TERM CACECTIC IT'S FROM GREEK WORDS THAT MEAN BAD CONDITION IN A FEW ROOMS I SAW THE SAME SWABS THESE LITTLE GREEN SPONGES ON THE END OF A STICK THAT WE USED TO KEEP ASA'S MOUTH CLEAN AND MOIST THE SWABS STAYED WITH ME BECAUSE I REMEMBER BEING GRATEFUL THAT THEY GAVE US AWAY A SMALL WAY WE COULD CARE FOR ASA EVEN AFTER HE'D STOP BEING ABLE TO TELL US WHAT HE WANTED THAT WAS THE HARDEST TIME FOR ME AT LEAST TO HEAR HIM GROANING AND NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO OR NOT DO WE GRILLED THE NURSES ABOUT WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS GOING ON AND WHAT WE SHOULD DO AND AT THE CAPLIN HOUSE I SAW THAT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE NURSE'S JOBS IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT A PERSON MIGHT NEED WHEN THEY CAN'T COMMUNICATE ANY MORE ARE YOU HAVING PAIN DOES THAT SOMETHING HURT PATTY'S BACK IN LORRY'S ROOM CRISTEL'S MOTHER IT'S NIGHTTIME WERE TO THE DOUBLE PART OF PATTY'S DOUBLE SHIFT AND LORRYE IS MOVING AROUND A LOT IN THE BED IT SOUNDS TERRIBLE TO SAY BUT I FELT COMFORTED TO SEE IT AND TO SEE OTHERS AT CAPLIN HOUSE DO IT TOO BECAUSE I'D SEEN IT WITH AESA APPARENTLY IT'S COMMONT TOWARD THE END IT'S CALLED TERMINAL AGITATION LORRY'S FAMILY HASN'T SLEPT IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS BECAUSE LORRY WAS UP ALL NIGHT LAST NIGHT DELIRIOUS MOVING SOMETIMES TRYING TO GET OUT OF BED EVEN THOUGH SHE'S TOO WEAK TO STAND AND COULD EASILY BREAK A BONE IF SHE FALLS ET'S EXHAUSTING TO DEAL WITH AND HARD TO WATCH THE PROBLEM WITH AGITATION AS A PALLIUTE OF CARE DOCTOR TOLD ME IS THAT IT ISN'T A DIAGNOSELESS IT'S SOMETHING YOU SEE BUT THE PERSON CAN BE DOING IT FOR LOTS OF REASONS EACH OF WHICH CALLS FOR A DIFFERENT APPROACH THEY COULD BE CONSTIPATED ANXIOUS IN PAIN SOME COMBINATION A DYING PERSON IS LIKE A BABY THAT WAY EXCEPT WE KNOW EVEN LESS ABOUT A DYING PERSON'S BRAIN THAN WE DO ABOUT A BABIES SOME OF THE GUESSES WE MAKE ARE BASE ON WHAT WE KNOW FROM COMAPATIONS BUT A DYING BRAIN IS NOT A COMATOS BRAIN IT'S DIFFERENT AND IN TERMS OF WHAT A DYING PERSON PERCEIVES SOME ONE WHOSE NON RESPONSIVE THE SCIENCE OF IT WE KNOW ALMOST NOTHING THE NURSE IS TOLD ME THEY ASSUME THAT PEOPLE CAN CURE US RIGHT TO THE END BUT NO ONE KNOWS FOR SORE LORRY'S EYES ARE OPEN BUT IT'S THAT DISTANT STARE LIKE ASI HAD SHE'S NOT SEEING WHAT'S IN FRONT OF HER HER MOUTH IS OPEN AND SHE'S SQUIRMING IN THE BED SHE WAS A SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETER AND SOMETIMES SHE SEEMS TO BE SIGNING BUT NO ONE IN THE ROOM KNOWS WHAT SHE'S SAYING IF ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TELL US SIHA PATY IS RIGHT UP CLOSE TALKING TO LORRY WATCHING HER FETS IT'S SOMETHING I SAW THE NURSES DO ITH ASA TOO GET RIGHT UP CLOSE IN TALK TO HIM AND WATCH HIS FACE IT WOULD EVEN AFTER HE SEEM TO HAVE STOPPED RESPONDING BECAUSE SOMETIMES SUDDENLY HE WOULD RESPOND ISPECIALLY TO DIRECT QUESTIONS I HAVING PAY YOU IN PAIN LORRY GIVES A SMALL SHAKE OF HER HEAD AN SAYS NO OH GOOD OH I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT YE DDO YOU HAVE TO PEA IM I'M

TALKING TO HER LOT I KNOW THE STRAIN OF THIS WAITING WHERE NOTHING IS HAPPENING AND YOUR BRAIN KEEPS FOOTTING BETWEEN THE GIANT EXISTENTIAL THING THAT'S GOING ON AND THE TEDIOUS NUTS AND BOLTS OF JUST GETTING THROUGH EVERY HOUR YOU KNOW O EVERY MOMENT SEEMS FULL OF MEANING AND YET NOT MEANING FULL AT ALL IT'S THE REAL AND IT IS CRAZY MAKING HOW ARE YOU DOING E LOEN YEI'M EXAUSTIN AMUS IT'S LIKE

MEAN EVEN IF HE DOESN'T KNOW E'M HERE AND NOT I KNOW EM HERE I NEVER KNEW WHAT ANY ONE WAS GOING TO SAY AT THE CAPLIN HOUSE LISTENING TO FAMILY MEMBERS IN ROOMS AND IN THE HALLS I GOT THE FEELING THAT THE BRAINS WERE FULL TO THE BRIM WITH WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND ASKING THEM ANY QUESTION TIPPED ALL THEIR THOUGHTS OUT IN A RUSH SOME PEOPLE TOLD ME THE WHOLE STORY OF THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT UP TO FIVE MINUTES AGO I HEARD ONE OF THE DOCTORS SAY TO AN EIGHTY FOUR YOU OLD WOMAN WHO WAS SITTING WITH HER DYING HUSBAND YOU KNOW HIM BETTER THAN WE DO TOES HE LOOK COMFORTABLE TO YOU THE WOMAN RESPONDED BY TELLING THE ENTIRE STORY OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP STARTING WITH WE MET WHEN I WAS THIRTEEN THE STAFF HAS A NAME FOR THAT KIND OF ANSWER IT'S CALLED LIFE OR VIEW THEY SAY IT HAPPENS A LOT AND I HEARD LIFE OR VIEWS THAT WERE A LOT DARKER THAN THAT ONE NOT EVERY DEATH IS THE END OF A WELL LIVED LIFE BUT ALL THE STORIES SEEM TO BE TRYING TO TACKLE THE SAME HUGE QUESTION HOW DID WE GET HERE BREE THIS ONE THING BUT WATCHING SOMEBODY DIE IT'S A WHOLE NOTHER THING PATTY AGAIN YOU KNOW NOT EVERYBODY CAN SIT BESIDE A DYING PERSON AND HOLD THEIR HAND AND YOU KNOW I I I THINK SOMETIMES IT'S TOO MUCH NOBODY WANTS THEIR LOVE ONCE TO BE ALONE I GET THAT BUT YOU KNOW YOU COULD WAIT HERE FOR DAYS AND DAYS AND WEN YOU GO TO TAKE THAT ONE SHOWERS WHEN THE PERSON MIGHT DIE YOU KNOW AND SOMETIMES A IN PEOPLE I'VE TALKED TO SAY IT'S COMMON THAT THE PERSON WILL DIE ELLOW WELL WAIT YOU KNOW THOUG IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEIR WAITING FOR EVERYONE TO COME AND GO AWAY IS THAT WHAY YOU FOND WE SEE THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN HEN I FIRST ARE TO WORKING THERE UN LIKE THIS IS A BIT OF  MUMBO JUMP AT IT JUST SEEMED I COME ON NOW I'M REPEATING THE SAME STUFF THAT I HEARD PEOPLE SAY WHEN I FIRST GOT THERE CAUSE I'VE SEEN IT YOU MEAN THAT PEOPLEL DIE WHENN'T WHEN EITHER EVERY ONE LEAVES THE ROM LOR YOU KNOW THEIR SPOUSE OR THEIR CHILD OR WHOEVER'S BEEN THERE FOR A LONG TIME THEY DIE AFTER THAT PERSON LEAVES THE ROOM OR THEYRE COMA TOST AND THEY THE LOVED ONCE KEEP SAYING HE'S WAITING FOR HIS BROTHER TO GET HERE ON SATURDAY THEYARE COMING FROM FLORID ON SATURDAY AND I'M INSIDE ROLLING MY EYES THINKING IT'S TUESDAY HE'S GOING TO DIE ON WEDNESDAY OR THURSDAY IT'S NOT GOING TO BE HERE ON SATURDAY ON FOR WHEN HIS BROTHER ARISES FROM FLORIDA AND THEN THE BROTHER ARRIVES AT LOW AGAIN SHOWS UP AT THE CAPLIN HOUSE THAT TWELVE THIRDY AND THE PATIENT DIES AT ONE AND THEY SAY TO ME I TELL YOU HE JUST NEEDED YOU KNOW BILLY TO COME FROM FLORIDA AND IT'S LIKE WHAT TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT WHOEVER THEY WERE VISITING AT THE CAPIN HOUSE ALWAYS BROUGHT UP OTHER EARLIER LOSSES ALWAYS ONE WOMAN WHO WAS SITTING WITH HER MOTHER TOLD ME ABOUT HOW HER HUSBAND HAD DIED SUDDENLY EIGHT YEARS EARLIER MAKING HER A WIDOW A AGE FIFTY ONE A WOMAN WHOSE YOUNGER SISTER WAS DYING SAID SHE LOST BOTH PARENTS BEFORE AGED THIRTEEN A WOMAN VISITING HER BROTHER TOLD ME ABOUT HOW HIS DAUGHTER HAD DIED YEARS AGO AND ONLY TWO YEARS OLD THE WOMAN SAID HER BROTHER WAS SO ANGRY ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER'S DEATH THAT HE SAID TO HER HIS SISTER WHY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ONE OF YOUR EFFING DAUGHTERS YOU'VE GOT TWO IT WAS LIKE A MAP THIS DEATH RELATED TO THAT DEATH OVER THERE LINK TO THIS LIVING PERSON HERE HIDDEN GEOGRAPHY SHAPING ALL OF OUR LIVES AFTER I'D BEEN AT THE CAPLIN HOUSE FOR SEVERAL DAYS I RAN INTO LARRY THE HUSBAND OF JOANN THE WOMAN PATTY COAXED IN TO GETTING A SHOWER BEFORE GOING HOME LARRY WAS SITTING ALONE IN THE MAIN COMMONARIA I KNEW IT COULDN'T BE GOOD THAT JOU ANNE WAS BACK SO SOON BET

TIN THAT'S WAS LOF IT IT'S AL I'M SO SORRYI BETTER PELD US ALL WIT THAT'S LIFE IWAS ON ON WHAT ONE OF THE MANY WAYS I'VE BEEN A SMUG IDIOT IN MY LIFE WAS BY DISPARRAGING THE USE OF EUPHAMISMS FOR DEATH AND DYING I THOUGHT IT WAS WEAK WHO WOULD DO THAT BY THE TIME AESA WAS AT THE END I HAD BARELY BEEN ABLE TO UTTER THE WORDS DEATH OR DYING FOR SEVERAL MONTHS I FELT LIKE THE THING ITSELF WAS ONLY MANAGEABLE IF I DIDN'T INVOKE IT PATTY TOLD ME THAT ONE OF HER STRATEGIES FOR PROTECTING HERSELF AT WORK IS NEVER TO IMAGINE HERSELF IN TE PLACE OF THE DYING PERSON OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS SHE TRIES NOT TO PICTURE HER HUSBAND OR HER KIDS I REMEMBER TRYING AND FAILING AT THAT I THINK PARD OF MY CLUMSINESS AROUND AESA AND MY MOTHER WAS MY BARELY SUPPRESSED TERROR AT THE THOUGHT OF MY OWN HUSBAND DYING I PICTURED MYSELF WHEN MY MOTHER'S PLACE ALL THE TIME EVERY MORNING BEFORE GOING TO HER APARTMENT I PULLED OUT A PIECE OF PAPER ANDI HAD TO READ THE WORDS ON IT OUT LOUD IN ORDER TO MAKE IT OUT THE DOOR YOUR HUSBAND ISN'T DYING THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU YOUR MOTHER NEEDS YOU GO TO HER APARTMENT NOW IT WAS MY OWN LITTLE SERENITY PRAYER GOD GRANT ME THE WISDOM TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY FEARE AND HER REALITY WHEN I HEARD A WOMAN AT THE CAPLIN HOUSE SAY TO HER HUSBAND WHO WAS DYING OF COLENCANCER SOMETHING LIKE WE HAD A REALLY GOOD RUN UNTIL THE LAST FEW MONTHS DIDN'T WE BABY I HAD

HAVE WATCHED THE FILM OVER AND OVER YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE DO NOT SEE FILMS TO WHICH THEY ORE AN AUDIENCE OF WON THESE STORIES ABOUT HOW WE CONNECT TE FILMS SOMETIMES YOU KNOW VERY DEEP WE BUT SOME OF THE VERY STRANGE AND RANDO WAYS STAY WIT HE AT ONE MANY THINGS SHE OUGHT TO UNDERSTAND WHAN OUR PRODUCERS DIAN WO SPEND MOST OF HER LIFE THINKING THAT SHE DID NOT HAVE A UNIQUE AND PERSONAL TAKE ON THE FILM THE SOUND OF MUSIC HE SOUND O MUSIC AFTER ALL I'VE READY LOVES IT WHAT'S HER TO SAY AND THEN SHE OR NOW HER TIG IS VERY DIFFERENT I WATCHED THE SOUND OF MUSIC ALL THE TIME AS IT KID IT WAS ONE OF MAYBE SIX WE  CESS TAPES WE HAD AT HOME ALONG WITH BANBY AN HUNDRED ON DELMACIONS AND A FEW YEARS AGO I WAST TALCONG WITH HER FRIEND ABOUT HOW MUCH I LOVED TO THE MAY BE GOING UP AND HE SAID ME TOO THOUGH THE NOT SEA SCARED ME AND I SAID WHAT NOT SEASE AND THAT'S WHEN I LEARNED I'D NEVER SEEN THE SECOND HALF OF THE FILM HE TURNS OUT THE MOVY CAME OUT IN A TWO V  CS BOCK SET AND I FOR SOMORIES AND HAD ONLY EVER SEEN THE FIRST TAPE MY DAD DOESN'T REMEMBER A SECONER AND WHY WOULD YOU NEED WHON THE FIRST HALF MAKES PERFECT SENSE ON IT SOWM HERE'S THE PLOT IT'S A MOVY ABOUT A WOMAN NAME MARIA WHO AS SENT TO THE COUNTRY SIDE TO BA BY SET A GIANT FAMILY OF CHILDRN WITH THE MEAN DAD THE MON TRAPS MARIA SHOWS UP UBBLY FUN AND THEE CHES THEM TO SING AND PLAYIND BE KITALL AGAINST THE WISHES OF HER FATHER BUT THE SINGING WHENC AN OVER THEY SING TOGETHER AS A FAMILY AND FINALLY AT A PARTY THE KIDSING A BEAUTIFUL SONG FOR THE GUESTS FAREWELL AND AFTER THAT MARIA HAVING SUCCESSFULLY FIXE THE FAMILY LAVES JUST LIKE MARY POPINSTID AND SHE FIXED THAT FAMILY AND THAT'S THE END OF THE MOVEME I HAD VERY CLEAR FONE MEMORIES OF THE GOAT HEARD PUPPIT SHOW AND THE SCENE IN THE GAZIBO WERE LEASEL THE OLDEST DAUGHTER  SECRETLY MET WITH THE MAL MAN SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH AND THEY SANG AND DANCED AND IT WAS SO ROMANTIC I HAD NO FURTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT ANY OF THE CHARACTERS SO WHEN I LEARNED THAT THERE WERE SEVENTY MORE MINUTES TO THE FILM I DIDN'T BOTHER GOING TO LOOK FOR THEM THE SOUND OF MUSIC WAS A FULL COMPLETE AND WONDERFUL ARTIFACT FROM MY CHILDHOOD I DADN'T WANT A TAINT IT WITH NOT SEASE BUT WHEN MY CHAEL ORKER LENA WHO'S PRODUCING THES WEEK SHOW AND IS A MUSICAL THEATRE FAN WHICH I MOST DEFINITELY AM NOT WHEN SHE FOUND OUT I STILL HADN'T SEEN THE WHOLE THING IT SEEMED HERETICAL TO HER SHE COULDN'T LET IT STAND SO WE WATCHED IT TOGETHER OVER THE IN HER NET ONE SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND I PREPARED TO HAVE A CHILDHOOD MEMORY EITHER SLIGHTLY INHANCEED OR COMPLETELY RUINED TEFORE WE STARTED SHE HAD ME PREDICT WHAT WAS GON TO BE IN THE SECOND HALF I WHY BASE OT AND THIS IS BASE ON MY CHILDHOOD MEMORY AND JUST LIKE WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS IT'S  THE SECOND HALF IS JUST FOKUS AH IN MY FAVOURITE TWO CHARACTERS LESEL AND THE HOT MAL MAN I WANT TO SEE THEIR CORT SHIP AND AND THEN THEY GET MARRIED AND THAT THE END OF THAT THE MOY WE HAD PLAY AND STARTED AT THE VERY BEGINNING STARTED WITH A PART IO KNOW AND THE FIRST HALF WAS MORE OR LESS THE SIMPLE SUNNY MOVY I REMEMBERED SEEING THE KINDLY AND DOWER NUNS COME ON SCREEN EARLY ON WAS LIKE RECOGNIZING TEACHERS I HAD IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL REPER MOTE SHEST A BEVY I SIMPLY CANOT FIN OBY THERE IS THAT GAZIBOSIAN WHEN THE MALMAN AND LEASELL SING TO EACHI OTHER IN STAXTEN OY ON SEVENTY NI TA I NI THEN WHIRL AROUND THE GAZIBO DANCING OI GAT THIS STILL LIX LIX SO MAT AWATCHING NOW THOUGH I SAW A LOT OF THINGS THAT I HAD COMPLETELY MISSED AS A KID BECAUSE AS A CHILD IT APPARENTLY IGNORED ANYTHING THAT ADULTS WHO WERE NOT MARIA SAID TO EACH OTHER LITERALLY NONE OF THAT DIALOGUE REGISTERED WAS LIKE THE MUMBLY GROWN UP IN CHARLEY BROUND MY KID SELF HAD EDITED FULL CHARACTERS OUT OF THE FILM I BARELY REMEMBERED THE BARONESS WHO ONCE TO MARRY THE DAD THIS REALLY IS EXCITING FOLMY GALE BE HERE WIT YOU TREESWORD MOT RUSHE WANTER OTABLE THAT IS NOT WHAT I MEAD YOU DO IT SO ANY OF THEIR PLOTLINES THAT WERE NOT RESULVED IN THE FIRST HALF WUT I ALSO MISSED OF COURSE HOW MARIA AND THE DAD SUPPOSEDLY FALL IN LOVE THE DAD BY THE WAY WAS EVEN MEANER THAN I REMEMBERED JUST CRUEL TO MARIA O

COMES BACK LATER IN THE FIRST HALF TO THROW ROCKS ON LEASEL'S WINDOW THAT MOMENT I REMEMBER AGAIN SO DREAMY BUT THE ONE THAT FOLLOWED WAS COMPLETELY OVER MY HEAD AS A KID I DIDN SEE I MEAN IT DIDN DOL YOUR HIL HITLER HIL HITLER YE HILL HITLER THE HERO OF MY VERSION OF THE SOUND OF MUSIC WHO I'D HOPED THE SECOAND HALF WOULD CENTER AROUND HE WAS THE NOTSY ALSO NOT THE MALE MAN YES HE WAS WEARING A UNIFORM AND DELIVERING MESSAGES BUT HE WAS NOT EMPLOYED BY THE POSTAL SERVIS AS MY CHILD'SELF HAD UNDERSTOOD HE WAS SOME KIND OF MILITARY MESSENGER THE FIRST HALF HIS PEPPERED WITH A HUMOR HINCE LIKE THIS THAT THINGS ARE GING TO TAKE A TURN HISTORICALLY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE MOVY UNEASY TALK ABOUT AUSTRIAN FLAGS AND SOMETHING CALLED AN ONSLUCE BUT ALL AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF A GLAMOROUS PARTY THE KIND OF EASY TO MISS IF YOU'RE SEVEN THE LAST THING I MISS OS A KID THE BIG TITLE CARD THAT'S SAYS INTERMISSION IN YELLOW SCRIT THAT COMES ON SCREEN AFTER MARIA CLOSES THE DOOR MAYBE WAS ON A

CART RESEL RASEL O RA I'M BASICALLY AS EXSITED TO SEE RALPH AS LEESEL IS RIGHT HERE BECAUSE MAYBE THIS IS WHEN WE GET TO THE VERSION OF THE SECOND HALF I'D BEEN WANTING TO SEE RALPHIN LEASEL'S COURTSHIP RAI'M SO CAD TO SEE YOU E IGROTAN YOUW'LL TAKE THIS PLACE AND TO LIVERTO YOUR FATHER AS SOON AS SHE COMES HOME OUCH RALPH HE STANDING IN FRONT OF A NOXSY FLAG WEASEL IS CLEARLY DISORIENTED BUT STILL HOPEFUL AS SHE HOLDS THE TELEGRAM AND COILY ASKS DON'T YOU WANT TO COME OVER TO NIGHT DDE RICESIP I'M NOT OCCUPIED WITH A MORE IMPORTANT BATIT AND YOUR FALLTHE BET OF BE TOO BE KNOWS WHAT'S GOOD FOR BUT RA ALWES SA YOU CHOS A BAD ONE THIS WAS THE ONLY RELATIONSHIP IN THE MOVI THAT INTERESTED ME AT ALL IS A CHILD AND IT SOBERING TO SEE THE WHOLE REALISTIC ARK OF IT AS FOR THE REST OF THE SECOND HALF IT'S PREDICTABLE YOU KNOW THEIR FIRST ESCAPE ISN'T CAN A WORK OUT IT'S OBVIOUS THILL WEN THE SINGING CONTEST GREAT SONGS FROM THE FIRST TAFFAR JUST RESYCLD IN A WEIRD WAY THE ONE MOMENT THAT MOVES ME THOUGH DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE CHARACTERS I WAS ATTACHED TO FROM THE FIRST HALF IT HAPPENS SURPRISINGLY WHEN THE DAD START SINGING A LOVE SONG TO HIS COUNTRY ON STAGE      HE'S DOING IT AS AN ACTIVE GENTLE DEFIANCE THAT MAKES THE NOTS SEE OFFICIALS MUSTACHE TWITCH AND AS THE CROWD JOINS IN WITH HIM I FEEL MY THROAT CUTCH A LITTLE THEY REMIND ME OF PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD THO SUMMER IN HONCONG THEY ROOTE BELLAROOSE HERE IN AMERICOT WEARE LONGING TO HOLD ON TO SOMETHIT AS THEIR OWN COUNTRYS CHANGE RAPIDLY EXCRUCIATINGLY AROUND THEM     THE DARKEST MOMENT OF THE MOVY IS PERHAP S AT THE VERY END WHEN THE FAMILY HAS ALMOST ESCAPED BUT THEN RALPH FINDS THEM IN THE ABBEY HE RAISES A WHISTLE TO TURN THEM IN BUT THE DAD STOPS AND REASONS WITH HIM YOU DON'T REARLY BELONG TO THEM STAVRY WAL COME AWAY WITH US WAC TOI RALPH LOOKS SCARED AND VOYISH HE REALLY CRISHES HIS GUN AND LEANS OVER RELIEVED BUT THEN THE DD TAKES AT ONE STEP TOO FAR YOU'LL NOV UP BE ONE OF

LATELY HE CAN LAST ABOUT THREE MINUTES FEELING LIKE EVERYTHING IS NARMAL BEFORE HE REMEMBERS IT ISN'T IT MADE ME UNDERSTAND THE URGED AND CLEAR THE DARK END OF THIS STORY AND THE MOVY ABOUT THE SINGING FAMILY BE CAUSE ONCE EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD O HIS CHANGED HE CAN'T REALLY WILL IT TO STAY OUTSIDE THE FRAME THAND WILL IS ONE OF THE PRODUCES OF OUR SHOW COMING OUT YOUR ECTS WIFE HAS FEW

TIMEA OF COURSE IT SATIRE AND IN THAT WAY IT'S CATHARTIC BUT WHEN I GOT TO THAT SCENE IT SUDDENLY FELT LIKE EVERY OTHER PART OF THE MOVI HAD BEEN AN ESCAPE FROM WAS GOING ON IT'S FUNNY THAT ONE OF THE MOST LUDICROUS PIECES OF DIALOGUE AS ALSO PRACTICALLY A QUOTE WE'VE HEARD IN THE NEWS IN TWENTY TWENTY AND NOT AS A JOKE  SO MUCH MORE OF THE STORY LEFT BUT JUST TO A BRIG SO THEY FINALLY MANAGED TO ISOLATE THE VIRUS AMAZINGLY BECAUSE IT'S MOVY THEY DEVELOP A VAXINE LIKE THAT DAY BUT THEY STILL HAVE TO TEST IT OUT SO THEY SPRAY IT IN PETE AND LIZZES NUPTIAL BED IN THE HOTEL ROOM OF THEIR SPENDING THEIR WEDDING NIGHT FAND SET UP A HIDDEN CAMERA BEHIND THE AIR VAN EVERYBODY IN THE BUNKER THE MAYOR THE FOUCHY CHARACTER J GARDER MONRO ALL OF THEM SIT AND MONITER THE COUPLE ON A BIG SCREEN AS

WATCHING ON THE MONITOR FROM THE BUNKER IS SIKED WE E BA A AL WA AR O TINGOR CATE OF IT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS SAYS ABOUT ME BUT OF ALL THE SCENES IN THE MOVI THIS IS THE ONE I REMEMBER THE MOST CLEARLY FROM THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT TACTUALLY KIND OF CARRIED IT AROUND ALL OF THESE YEARS CAUSE IT'S GENUINELY SO SAD LIZ LOOKS LIKE HER HEART IS BREAKING IN REAL TIME OAY  A  BE AN CLIN YOURE CURIOUO ABO  I CI REN THE APRA DRAN I  CAN O BAI COULDN'T MA BA ND O LA  PETE SHRUGGS   YOU YOUR OSIN   O OUT ABOUT A APOSITIVE REAC POSITIVE THERE'S A HAPPY ENDING LIZ DECIDES TO LEAVE NEW YORK AND MOVE HOME BUT AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE SHE GOES TO SAY GOOD BYE TO A MEGO THE BIRD WHO'S IN AZU NOW AND PET'S THERE TOO  WA WE DO THAT ROM COM RUNNING THING  AND JUST LIKE THAT THEI'RE BACK TOGETHER THE CITY SPUWS THE BAXINE INTO THE AIR BY A FACTORY CHIMNEYS AND EXHAUST PIPES AND MOST OF NEW YORK LIVES MISERABLY EVER AFTER BUT SOME PEOPLE STAY PLEASANT AND UPLIFTED BECAUSE MAJOR PLOT TWIST FIFTY PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO SEEM TO BE INFECTED ACTUALLY NEVER GOT THE VIRUS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE JOY JUST RUBBED OFF ON THEM AND LIZ WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHICH IS WHY SHE DIDN'T GET QUOTIN QUOTE BETTER IN THE HOTEL ROOM WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE MORAL OF THE MOVI THAT HAPPINESS IS A CHOICE BUT WATCHING THE MOVI DURING THIS PANDEMIC I DREW ANOTHER DARKER CONCLUSION SOMEHOW THAT WIGLY WEIRD JOLT OF RECOGNITION I GOT OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHAT IT FELT LIKE WAZ THIS IS HOW IT GOES WHEN FACE WITH HA CRISIS LIKE THIS GOVERNMENTS WILL NINIMIZE THE SEVERITY OF THE DANGER THEL VALUE THE WRONG THINGS FOCUS ON THE ECONOMY OVER PEOPLE'S LIVES AND BLAME FOREIGNERS IN AN UGLY ZENOPHOBIC WAY I'M SURE THERE'S VERSION OF AMERICA WERE ALL THAT MAGH NOT HAPPEN TBUT WE ARE NOT LIVING IN THAT AMERICA RIGHT NOW AND PETE AND LIZ WEREN'T LIVING IN IT EITHER IF IT'S POSSIBLE FOR HUMAN BEINGS TO DO THE WRONG THING WE'LL FIGURE OUT AWAY WE'RE RESORCEFUL LIKE THAT JOHNKOL IS ONE OF PRODUCIES OF A SHOW  M EREIA ATRE RECTORS CUT SO SHORTEDAYS BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE A VERY PATICULAR TAKE ON SOME FILM AND THE PERSON IN THE S NEXT TRRY FINDS HIMSELF IN TO SITUATION THAT NOT MANY A SERVICAN TO BEIN HIS EX WIFE DECIDED TO REVISIT THE PART OF THE WIVES AS THEIR MARRIAGE FELL APART AND MAKE A MOVY ABOUT IT  ANYWAY ABOUT A COUPLE WHOSE LIFE SEEMS VERY VERY PARALLEL TO THEIRS IN WOTS OF WAYS THIS FICTIONAL

EXPLAINS WHAT HPPENED NEXT WILL HEARD ABOUT THE MOVY FROM SOME FRIENDS WHEN HIS ACK'S WIFE STARTED WORKING ON IT THE VERY THOUGHT OF IT MADE HIM ANXIOUS HIS ACTS REBECCA E VENTUALLY BROUGHT ET UP WITH

BOOK PEOPLE POSTING THE TRAILER FOR THE MOVY AND BEING LIKE AK GO SEE THIS MOVY IF IT'S IN ATHEATRENER YOU CAUSE WAS MADE BY REBECCA ATLMAN AND SHE'S GRAT AND SO FUNNY AND I SAW THOSE POPPING UP AN THEN I JUST HAD THIS MOMENT WHERE I WAS LIKE OH THE MOMENT IS HERE AND THAT WAS WHEN I WAS FILLED WITH THE MOST RET WHAT WERE THOSE THOUGHTS FOR ME I WAS THE THING I WAS THE MOST AFRAID OF IS THAT THE MOVY WOULD PORTRAY ME ACCURATELY WILLS CAMTED ABOUT HIS FAS ADMITS HE WAS KIND OF A DOT AS A HUSBAND WILLIN REBECCA THAT WHEN SHE WAS TWENTY THREE HE WAS JUST NINETEEN THEY WERE TO GETHER FOR EIGHT YEARS MARRIED FOR ALMOSTS FIVE DURING THAT TIME HE WAS MUSTLY ON IM PLAYE THOUGH HE EVENTUALLY STARTED DOING PART TIME WORK WALKING DOGS AND HOUSE SITTING HE DID SOME STAND UP BUT NOT VERY OFTEN

OUT OF NOWHERE SHE GOT HOME FROM WORK AND AND SHE JUST HEAD LIKE A VERY VERY STRANGE LIKE YOU KNOW THE WAY PEOPLE WILL START LIKE THEY'LL BE LIKE SO THEN SHE SET ME DOWN AND SHE WAS JUST TELLING ME

ALL HER HUSBAND'S TERRIBLE QUALITIES AND EVERYONE SAYING WHAT THEY REALLY THINK OF HIM THAT NEVER HAPPENS THERE'S NO SEEN WHERE ANYONE BAD MOUTHS HIM NONE AT ALL NO ONE TELLS ANYONE TO DUMP THE LOSER INSTEAD WHAT HAPPENS AS MUCH MORE INTERESTING LATE IN THE FILM FRANNY SITS DOWN TO TALK TO HER MAMM ABOUT HER MARRIAGE IN THE SCENE SHE'S TRYING TO CONVINCE HERSELF TO STAY WITH HIM BAT EVERYTHINGS PI WELL SITS FORWARD IN HIS SEAT THE DAY IS MARRIAGE FELL APART WELL CAME HOME AND REBECCA WAS ON THE COUCH CRYING SHE SAID SHE'D BEEN TALKING ER ER MAMM BUT HE NEVER KNEW WHAT THEIR CONVERSATION WAS

SUX SEEING HOW UPSET SHE IS THAT LIKE SUX SHE LIKE FELT REALLY BET LIKE IS JUST A BAD FEELING FOR SOME ONE TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH YOU'RE SEEING HOW HARD IT WAS FOR HER WHAT JUST I I DON'T THINK I WAS INCORRECT TO FOCUSS ON MY OWN STRUGGLES DURING THE WHOLE PROCESS OF SPLITTING UP BUT IT DID CANT OF PREVENT ME FROM LIKE STHINGING ABOUT HERS AS WELL I JUST DIDN'T HAVE AS MUCH OF IT APPRECIATION FOR LIKE THE DIFFICULTY OF IT THE LIKE MISERY THAT GOES INTO THAT CHOICE IT'S SAT IT ALSO IS A LITTLE BIT OF A RELIEF THAT WAS HARD FOR HER IF IT HAD BEEN VERY EASY FOR HER TO INTINGS I WOULD HAVE FELT LIKE SUCH ABSOLUTE TRASH AM IF JUST ONE DAY SHE COME ON BE LIKE YO WHAT NAT FOR ME BY PAL BUT THAT'S THE STORY YOU'VE KIND OF BEEN TELLING YORSELF A YEFOR YEARS WILL HAD BEEN TELLING HIMSELF THE SAME VERSION OF THEIR BREAK UP SOMETHING HE'D SAND PAPER DOWN INTO THIS REBECCA GOT HER BIG BRAK AND THEN SHE DUMPED HIMOUT OF THE BLOE HE WAS HEARTBROKEN SHE WAS HAPPY AND THRIVING MOVING ON WAS EASY FOR HER BE WATCHING THIS IT CAME FLOTDING BACK AT LEAST A YEAR MAYBE MORE WHEN REBECCA WAS SAD BEFORE THEIR BREAK UP IT WAS LIKE TIME TRAVELLING THROUGH ALL THIS PAIN THAT HE DELEDED FROM HIS MEMORY  BWE ASKED REBECCA TO COME TALK ABOUT HER MOVY WITH WILL SHE MET US AT THE HOUSE WHERE WELL WERE HALT SETTING IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD THE TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER AND TRAFFIC IN THE SIX YEARS SINCE THEIR MARRIAGE ENDED THEY'VE NEVER HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT AND FOR HER UNDERSTANDABLY THIS DID NOT SEEM LIKE THE BEST WAY TO BEGIN ONE BY TALKING ABOUT HER MOVY YOU KNOW IT HAS A THEY MEAN THIS SON CERTAIN SENSE IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WILL IT'S IS OWN MOVY IT'S NOT A DOCUMENTARY SO I A KIND OF OBJECT TO THE IDEA THAT WERE IN A READ INTO THIS MOVY WE'RE TO USE IT OF SOME KIND OF LIKE SECRET CODE UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THIS REAL LIFE RELATIONSHIP THAT EXISTED BUT ALSO I FELLI LIKE THE WAY YOU SAY IT THING I WAS IT JUST MEED A MOVE WAS JUST A MOVY LI WHYRE YOU READING INTO THE FOVY BUT I FEE LIKE THERE ARE IT'S MORE IT'S MORE SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO AN EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAD SURE BUT I'M NOT YOU KNOW MNOT THE A FIRST PERSON TO DO SUCH A THING YAD I OT DOG WALK WELL BU I I SAID THAT'S THY I KNO I WAS LIKE HE'S GOING A DOGS IT ANDOU CAN I HAVE NO AMBITION YE I I ALSO I GUESS I ALWAYS THOUGHT OF THAT CHARACTER AS NOT SOME ONE WITHOUT AMBITION BUT SOMEONE WHO WAS AFRAID AND I'M NOT THAT THAT'S NOT ME LIKE LOOKING AT YOU GOING LIKE THAT WAS THIT THAT'S REALLY WHO YOU ARE WELL TELLS REBECCA WHAT HE TOLD ME HOW THE MOST EMOTIONAL PART OF THE MOVY WAS SEEN HAR SIDE OF THINGS HOW HOW HARD IT WAS FOR HER TO DECIDE TO BREAK OUT AR AND THEN TO FINALLY DO IT IT IT FELT BAD BECAUSE IT WAS JUST HER TRYING TO JUSTIFY NOT ENDING IT OR TRYING TO CONVINCE HERSELF LIKE IT'LL GIT BETTER AND THAT WAS LIKE A VERY EMOTIONAL THING FOR MADE AND THE MOST AFFECTING PART OF THE MOVI LIKE HARD TO WATCH IS IT BECAUSE IT REMINDED YOU OF THAT LAST SO BIG CONVERSATION WE HAD THAT WAS EMOTIONAL IT IT FELT BAD BECAUSE IT REMINDED ME OF LIKE YOU HAVING TO DO YOURSELF KIND OF ALL OF THE RECOGNIZING OF THE PROBLEMS IN THE RELATIONSHIP I HAD I JUST HADN'T EVER CONSIDERED THE LIKE JOURNEY TO COMING TO THAT POINT IN THAT CONCLUSION AND LIKE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DO THAT ISCLEAR RIND THE MIXSIONS THINK SO I MEAN IS THA NOW LIKE THE PART OF THE SHOW WE JUST TALK OT A BRI THAT YOU WANT ME TO RESPOND YE I I MEAN DON'T REALLY WANT TO GET INTO IT BUT THAT WAS A REALLY TOUGH PERIODES WERE REALLY KIND OF LIKE WEIRDLY DARK CONFUSING TIMES AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT I WROTE THIST IT WASN'T LIKE I WAS TRYING O RITE THIS SO YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND SOMETHING OI WAS DOING IT SO THAT I COULD UNDERSTAND SOMETHING I FEEL LIKE SO I MEAN I I OBVIOUSLY RELATE TO THIS SECAUSE I I'M GOING THROUGH DIVORSE I LEFT MY HUSBAND A YEAR AGO AND O MORE PERSONAL MFOU MY MARRIAGE SEEMS REALLY SIMILAR TIRES MY HUSBAND WAS MUSTLING AN EMPLOYED I WAS TAND ONE WHO WAS WORKING ALL THE TIME NEITHER WAS WERE HAPPY AND I HAD TO BE THE ONE TO CALL AT OR IF KNEW AND I HAVE TO SAY I WISH HE WOULD GIVE ME CREDIT YOU KNOW I IT WAS REALLY AWFUL AND HARD AND HARTBREAKING AND I WAS TORMENTED BY IT IN WHO AS THE HARDEST DECISION IV EVER MADE 'M AND I JUST I LIKE THIS IS MY DREAM REALIZATION THAT MY PARTNER COULD EVER HAVE WHICH IS TO SAY LIKE O MY GOD LIKE YOU IT WAS HARD FOR YOU TOO LIKE DESDI ARE YOU GETTING MAT ER YOU GETTING   MY LIKE PROJECTING NO I MEAN I'M IT'S JUST AM WE'VE BEEN BROKEN UP FORHOWLONG NOW LIKE OVER SIX YERE YE I MEAN THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN BENDING MUCH OF THAT TIME GOING THINKING OH I HOPE WILL UNDERSTANDS MY PERSPECTIVE SOME DAY YOU KNOW I I THINK I'VE JUST I THINK IT'S REALLY NICE THAT THAT THAT THAT MAYBE THERE IS SOME KIND OF MUTUAL MIDDLE GROUND THAT WE'RE SEEING IT FROM BUT I THINK THAT I JUST IT WAS A AVE FOR ME TO LET WILL HAVE HIS OWN PAT THROUGH IT WELL HAD A STORY OF HOW THINGS ANDED THAT WAS CEMENTED IN HIS MIN AND WITHOUT THE FILM HE WOULD HAVE GONE ON THINKING IT CHERRY PICKING THE MOMENTS THAT MADE HIM FILL THE WORST REBECCA AYS IF HE WIN YOUR ACTO UNDERSTAND YOUR BREAK UP THE BEST WAY PROBABLY ISN'T TO MAKE A MOVY ABOUT IT IT'S AWAY TOO MUCH WORK AND MONEY AND THE MOST LIKELY

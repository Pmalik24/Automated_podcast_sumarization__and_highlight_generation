AN ACCESS YOUR LEVEL OF MENTAL HEALTH WITH DOCTOR PAUL CANTY DOCTOR PAULCANTI WELCOME THANK YOU I'M VERY EXCITED FOR TO DAY'S EPISODE AND FOR THE SERIES BECAUSE I LIKE SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE I'VE LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT MYSELVE AND THEMSELVES AND NOT JUST ABOUT OURSELVES BUT HOW THE DIFFERENT PERSONALITY TYPES OUT THERE THE HEALTH THE TYPES THE NARSUSIS TE KOW ALL THE THINGS THAT WE HEAR ABOUT THESE DAYS GAS LIGHTING ALL THESE SORTS OF THINGS WHAT ALL OF THAT REALLY IS PERHAPS WE CAN DISPEL SOME OF THE MISTS THAT EXIST DURING THE COURSE OF THE SERIES I'M SURE WE WILL FOR YOU WILL THIK AND ALSO RAISE CERTAIN IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT WE SHOULD ALL ASK OURSELVES AN TERMS OF TRY NTO UNDERSTAND WHO WE ARE AND HOW WE CAN BE THE BEST VERSIONS OF OURSELVES HOW WE CAN EXPERIENCE THE MOST HAPPINESS ALSO THE THE MOST RICHNESS IN LIFE BECAUSE COURSE LIFE ISN'T JUST ALL ABOUT BEING HAPPY SO START OFF THIS QUESTION I ONE ARAIS A PARALLEL WITH SOMETHING I THINK FOR MOST PEOPLE AS IS MORE CONCRETE WHICH IS PHYSICAL HEALTH NO A WELL THERE ISN'T AN IDEAL PHYSIC AL SELF THAT'S BEEN DEFINED BY THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY WE KNOW FOR INSTANCE THAT THEIR IS A RANGE OF BLOOD PRESSURES THAT ARE CONSIDERED HEALTHY THERE'S A A RANGE OF BODY MASS INDECT THAT S CONCEDERED HEALTHY HH THAT'S A LITTLE CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE DPENDS ON HOW MUCH MUSCLE HOW LEAN PEOPLE ARE ET CETERA BUT NO I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO SAY THAT THE HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL IS NOT CONGOING TO GET EXHAUSTED WALKING UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRS THEY COULD BEND DOWN AND LIFT AN OBJECT WITHOUT HURTING THEMSELVES THEY MIGHT EVEN HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL STRENGTH OR ENDURANCE ET CETERA WITHIN THE PHYSICAL HEALTH DOMAIN ALL OF THAT IS FAIRLY WELL SCRIPT IT AND THER PROTOCALLS THAT PEOPLE CAN FOLLOW TO IMPROVE THEIR PHYSICAL HEALTH WE COVERED MANY OF THEM ON THE POTCAST BEFORE WHEN IT COMES TO MENTAL HEALTH AND IT COMES TO CONCEPTS OF THE SELF THINGS BECOME MUCH MORE ABSTRACT FOR PEOPLE IN FACT I THINK MOST PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF OR GON WANDERING AROUND IN THE DARK WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE THE BEST VERSIONS OF OURSELVES WHETHER NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT OURSELVES IN THE WORLD AROUND US IN THE BEST WAYS SO TO START THINGS OFF YOU TELL US WHAT IS THE HEALTHY VERSION OF SELF MEAN WHAT WHAT WHAT SHALL WE ALL BE ASPIRING TO YOU'VE WORKED WITH PEOPLE WHO A PRESUME LWE ARE HEALTHY AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEVERE PATHOLOGIES OF DIFFERENT PSYCHIATRIC TYPES Y BIPOLER AR CICISTIC SO SEE OPATHIC A AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN SO FOR ME AND FOR THE LISTENERS WHAT IS A HEALTHY SELF WHAT SHOULD WE BE STRIVING FOR BUT HEALTHY SELF REPROACHES LIFE THROUGH THE LENDS OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE IF YOU LOOK AT HAPPY PEOPLE A PEOPLE WHO LIKE THEIR LIVES RIGHT NO MATTER WHAT STAGE OF LIFE THER A I  NO MATTER WHAT THEIR SOCIA ECONOMIC STATUS IS I NO RACE RELIGION THTHES SO MANY THINGS THAT WE WE THINK MATTERS RIGHT AND AND AND AND THEY MATTER TO A LOT OF THINGS DO THEY MATTER TO IS SOMEONE HAPPY OR NOT WHY THEY THEY ARE NOT FACTORS RIGHT THE FACTORS THAT TELL US IS THIS PERSON ENJOYING LIFE THNG THEY TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES THEY HAPPY THERE HERE ARE THEY ENGAGE PRODUCTIVELY IN THE WORLD IS AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AND IF WE HAVE THOSE TWO THINGS THEN IS INTERESTING YOU ALMOST NEVER SEE SOME ONE GO WRONG RIGHT AND EVEN IF IF THEIR DIFFICULTIES EVEN IF THERE ARE THE THINGS HAPPEN IN LIFE THAT THAT CAN MAKE SOME UNHAPPINESS RIGHT IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE PERSONS ENGAGEMENT IN LIFE PERSONS ENTHUSIASM FOR LIFE AND THINK IF YOU LOOK AT EVEN TRADITIONS OF UNDERSTANDING HOW ARE PEOPLE HAPPY WHETHER IT'S IN PSYCHIATRY OR ITS THROUGH LITERATURE OR THROUGH RELIGIOUS LENDS IT IS ALWAYS PEOPLE WHO APPROACH LIFE THROUGH THE LENDS OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE COULD WE GO A LITTLE BIT DEEPER ON AGENCY AND GRATITUDE WHEN I HEAR THE WORDS AGENCY AND GRATITUDE I THINK AGENCY AND ABILITY TO AFFECT THE WORLD AROUND ME IN THE WAYS THAT I WANT I THINK GRATITUDE THINK THANKFUL AND AT WE DIDN'TIRE EPISODE ALL ABOUT GRATITUDE PRACTICES SOME OF THE NORROL SCIENCE AND NURROAMAGING AND NOR CHEMICAL CHANGES THAT OCCUR IN THE BRAIN ANDBODY WHEN PEOPLE EXERT A GRATITUDE PRACTICE BUT IHAVE A FEELING THAT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AGENCY AND GRATITUDE MAGT BE TALKING BOUT SOMETHING SLIGHTLIER MAY BE VEN QUITE A BIT DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY THAT I'M DEFINING IT YE I WOULD SAY AGENCY AND GRATITUDE ARE THESE AMAZING REWARDS RIGHT THAT SIT ON TOP OF THE HIGHLY COMPLEX BRAIN FUNCTION INSIDE OF US AND THE HIGHLY COMPLEX PSYCHOLOGY IN ALL OF US SO IF WE THINK ABOUT ASELF RIGHT THAT I IDENTIFY ASELF IGHT I'M AN I RIGHT IF I'M GOING APPROACH THE WORLD WITH AGENCY AND GRATITUDE THAT SITTING ON TOP OF A LOT OF HEALTHY THINGS RIGHT AND THE IDEA THAT OK EITHER WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN BE MENTALLY UNHEALTHY RIGHT BUT TO START WITH LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON INSIDE OF US RIGHT AND WHAT IS IT LOOK LIKE WHEN WE'RE HEALTHY SO THERE'S A STRUCTURE OF THE SELF RIGHT THERE'S FUNCTION OF THE SELF AND WIF WE LOOK AT THE S TRUCTURE AND THE FUNCTION AND THE PARTS OF COMPONENTS OF STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION WE CAN COME TO UNDERSTAND ET WHAT IS GOING ON IN US WHAT MIGHT WE CHANGE FOR THE BETTER HOW DO WE BUILD EMPOWERMENT RIGTS EMPOWERMANT IS IS THE THE THE ABILITY TO NAVIGATE THE WORLD AROUND US AND TO BRING MYSELF TO BEAR IN WAYS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE AND FROM EMPOWERMENT ARISES THE SENSE OF AGENCY RIGHT I HAVE AGENCY BECAUSE I AM EMPOWERED AND ALSO FROM A HEALTHY STRUCTURE OF SELF AND FUNCTION OF SELF WE END UP WITH HUMILITY RIGHT WE COME THROUGH THAT WITH THE SENSE OF ARE OUR PLACE IN THE WORLD AND OUR POWER IN THE WORLD TO TO NAVIGATE AS WE CHOOSE BUT ALSO A SENSE OF THE WORLD AROUND US THAT'S FAR MORE COMPLICATED RIGHT THAN JUST WE ARE EXTENDS BEYOND US TO OTHER PEOPLE TO THE CLIMATE AROUND US TO THE HEALTH OF THE WHOLE PLANET RIGHT WE WE FEEL THE SENSE OF HUMILITY THAT I'M HERE AND I CAN DO GOOD THINGS UNFORTUNATE TO BE HERE AND ON PART OF THIS BIGGER EGO SYSTEM RIGHT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE SCALE OF THE EGOSYSTEM OF EARTH RIGHT AND IF WE FEEL THAT HUMILITY THEN WE APPROACH THE WORLD THROUGH THE LENDS OF GRATITUDE SO THE IDEA THAT A HEALTHY STRUCTURE OF SELF AND A HEALTHY FUNCTION OF SELF LEADS TO EMPOWERMENT AND HUMILITY THAN UPON THAT WE ARE WE ARE SO TO IMBUED WITH AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AND THAT LEADS US FORTH TO HAPPY LIVES OCASO IT'S CLEAR TO ME WHY HAVING AGENCY AND GRATITUDE WOULD BE WONDERFUL PERHAPS EVEN THE GOAL STATE THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE SEKING TO ACHIEVE AND IT ALSO MAKE SENTS TO ME AS TO WHY IMPOWERMENT AND HUMILITY ARE IMPORTANT COMPONENTS THAT FEED INTO OUR ABILITY TO HAVE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE IF BECAUSE ALL OF THAT AT LEAST TO MY MIND SUMS TO IT A VERY CLEAR STATEMENT ABOUT HAVE HING AGENCY IN GRATITUDE IS THE BEST WAY TO APPROACH LIFE THAT ALL MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO ME AND YET I'VE NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT WAY AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE HAVE AN EVERY BEEN TOLD THIS RIGHT OVING WHAT SHOALL WE BE SEEKING AGENCY AND GRATITUDE YES WE'VE HEARD ENDLESS NUMBER OF PODCASTS INCLUDING THIS PODCAST ABOUT PHYSICAL HEALTH AND WE'VE BEEN TOLD BY PHYSICIANS AND EVERYBODY ELSE THAT YOU KNW WE SHOULD SEEK TO HAVE A RELATIVELY LOW BUT A PRESSURE WE SHOULD SEEK TO HAVE A RELATIVELY LOW HEART RATE THAT OUR COLLESTERALL SHOULD BE AT A CERTAIN LEVEL ET CETERA SO WITHIN THE PHYSICAL HEALTH DOMAIN YOUTHEIR STRONG CLEAR MESSAGES ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD ALL BE STRIVING TOART AND IN A SIMILAR WAY TO HOW WE'RE DISCUSSING THE SELF AND PSYCHOLOGY NOW I DON'T THINK ANY ONE SEEKS TO HAVE LOW BLOOD PRESSURE OR LOW HEART RATE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT PER SE THEY WANT THOSE THINGS ALONG WITH SOME CAPACITY FOR ENDURANCY BUILITY OR TO YOUT LIFT AN OBJECTS OF SOME STRENGTH ET CETERA BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THOSE METRICS OF HEALTH ALLOW THEM TO MOVE THROUGH THE WORLD IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY IN OTHER WORDS HAVING SOME DEGREE OF ENDURANCE ALLOWS YOU TO WALK DOWN THE BLOCK MAY BE A LOT FURTHER OR O WALK UP SEVERAL FLIGHTS OF STAIRS OR TO HAVE SOME STRENGTH ALLOWS YOU TO PICK UP OBJECTS AND EEFFECTIVELY MOVE THROUGH LIFE YOU'RE TELLING US THAT HAVING A SENSE OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AND THAT AGENCY IN GRATITUDE OR UNDERGIRDED BY EMPOWERMENT AND HUMILITY AND THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO MOVE THROUGH LIFE THE MOST EFFECTIVE HAPPIEST IF YOU WILL WAY TO MOVE THROUGH LIFE WELL THEN I THINK WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES THE SAME THING WE WOULD ASK ABOUT PHYSICAL FITNESS WHICH IS WHAT GOES IN TO CREATING A SENSE OF AGENCY AN GRATITUDE EMPOWERMENT AND HUMILITY YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE ACTION STEPS BECAUSE IF I WANT MORE ENDURANCE I KNOW TO GET ON EXERCISE BYY COR OR A TREAD MILL OR GO OUT FOR RUN A FEW TIMES A WEEK OR MORE IF I WANT TO GET STRONGER I'M GOING TO LIFT OBJECTS THAT ER DIFFICULT TO LIFT UNTIL THEY'RE EASIER TO LIFT I MAN SELL PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD IN THE PHYSICAL DOMAIN BUT IN THE IN THE MENTAL HEALTH DOMAIN IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DOMAIN IT DOES BECOME A BIT MORE ABSTRACT I THINK IN PART BECAUSE NO ONE'S EVER TOLD US CERTAINLY NO ONE'SNEVER TOLD ME WHAT YOU REALLY NEED IN IS AGENCY AN GRATITUDE IN ORDER TO HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE LIFE SO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATED YOUR TELLING US THUS AND I LOVE FOR YOU TO TELL US WHAT ARE THE ACTION STEPS THAT GO IN TO CREATING THESE THINGS THAT WERE CALLING AGENCY GRATITUDE EMPOWERMENT IN HUMILITY THERE'S ACTUALLY QUITE A STRONG PARALLEL BETWEEN THE PHYSICAL HEALTH DIMENSION AND THE MENTAL HEALTH DIMENSION SO SO AS YOU'RE SAYING LIKE WHYDE YOU PUT IN THE TIME THE ENERGY THE LEARNING RIGHT TO BE PHYSICALLY HEALTHY RIGHTS A LOT OF EFFORT AND AND IF WE PUT SO MUCH OF OURSELES TOOWARDS IT IF IF WE DECIDE THAT WE VALUE THAT RIGHT WHY DO WE DO IT RIGHT BECAUSE AS YOU SAID IT'S THE BEST WAY TO APPROACH LIFE LIKE THERE MAY BE SOME THING THAT I WANT TO DO I I WANT A RUN A RACE RIGHT OR IGHT WHY I WANT TO CLIM A MOUNT AND WRIGHT BUT ULTIMATELY WE TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES PHYSICALLY BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S COMING NEXT IN LIFE AND WE WANT TO BE PREPARED FOR IT GOOD BAD AND OTHERWISE RIGHT AND THE SAME THING IS TRUE OF MENTAL HEALTH SO I CAN FEEL GRATEFUL FOR SOMETHING I CAN FEEL GRATEFUL THAT I'M STILL BREATHING RIGHT NOW RIGHT I CAN EXERCISE AGENCY I CAN PICK UP THAT CUP AND TAKE A DRINK RIGHT BUT THAT DOES IT MEAN THAT I'M LIVING LIFE THROUGH THE LENDS OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH EVERY OPINION IF YOU LOOK PSYCHOLOGICALLY THROUGH THE LENDS A LITERATURE THROUGH THE LENDS OF OF SOCIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY AGENCY AND GRATITUDE MAKE HAPPINESS RIGHT THER WAYS OF APPROACHING LIFE AND JUST LIKE PHYSICAL HEALTH IS UNDERGIRDED BY ABY CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH AT HEART HEALTH THE MUSCLE STRENGTH RIGHT THAT THERE'S AN UNDERGIRDING OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AND EMPOWERMENT AND HUMILITY ARE WAYS OF DESCRIBING OKET WHAT A RISE IS RIGHT FROM UNDERSTANDING OURSELVES TAKEN CARE OF OURSELVES THAT THEN GIVES US THE AGENCY AND GRATITUDE SO WE HAVE EMPOWERMENT WE HAVE HUMILITY BUT WHERE DOES IT ALL COME FROM RIGHT SO JUST LIKE WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE PHYSICAL BODY AND WHAT TO DO TO IT IN ORDER TO BE HEALTHY RIGHT WE ALSO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE MIND RIGHT THE SELF THAT WANTS TO BE HEALTHIER AND THAT COMES THROUGH UNDERSTANDING THE STRUCTURE OF THE SELF AND WE HAVE ENOUGH SCIENCE THROUGH THE LENS OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY TO UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE OF SELF AND THEN THE FUNCTION OF SELF RIGHT IS HOW WE WORK RIGHT HOW WE INTERFACE WITH THE WORLD SO IT'S ACTUALLY NOT MORE COMPLICATED THAN PHYSICAL HEALTH IT'S JUST THAT WE DON'T SPELL IT OUT THAT WAY RIGHT WE COME AT IT THROUGH THE LENS OF PYTHOLOGY OF WHAT'S WRONG AND WHO HAS SOME DIAGNOSIS AND YOU KNOW WHATWE'RE LOOKING FOR THE PROBLEMATIC INSTEAD OF SAYING LIK WHAT'WE LOOK LIKE ONE WERE HAPPY RIGHT AND THEN GOING AND DIGGING DOWN INTO THE MECHANICS OF IT ALL RIGHT AND IF WE'RE NOT IN THAT STATE RIGHT TO GO AND LOOK AT THAT AND TO MAKE CHANGES JUST AS IF YOU WERE VERY VERY PHYSICALLY HEALTHY RIGHT BUT YOU KNOW YOUR HEART RIGHT COULDN'T GO UP THAT MUCH WITHHOUT YOU FEELING VERY VERY FATIGUED WE SAY WELL LOOK YOU'RE DOING A LOT OF THE RIGHT THINGS RIGHT BUT LET'S WORK MORE ON ON YOUR HEART RIGHT WE WOULD GO LOOK AT THE SPECIFICS OF IT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE UNDERSTAND IT AND WE JUST DON'T APPLY THE SAME SCIENCE LOGIC COMMON SENSE TO MENTAL HEALTH AS WE DO TO PHYSICAL HEALTH BUGT IT'S TIME FOR THAT TO CHANGE BECAUSE WE HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE AND ABILITY TO DO JUST THAT WHEN WE HAD DOCTOR ANY GALPAND ON THE SPOTCAST TO DO A SERIES ON PHYSICAL HEALTH AND ON FITNESS ESSENTIALLY HE SAID SOMETHING THAT REALLY STUCK WITH ME WHICH WAS AT INTHE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WORK OUTS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO OUT THERE BODYWEIGHT WORK OUTS WORK WITH WAIGHTS WITH MACHINES YOU CAN RUN FAR YOU CAN RON SHORTER DISTANCES WORE QUICKLY YOU DO PLANKS YOU SIT UP SO MANY VARIATIONS ON EXERCISE ROUTINES BUT WHAT HE VERY CLEARLY STATED WAS THAT THERE ARE ONLY A FEW CORADAPTATIONS THAT THE BODY CAN UNDERGO THAT LEAD TO THESE BY PRODUCTS THAT WE CALL LORD BLOOD PRESSURE ENHANCED ENDURANCE INPROVE STRAINTH IMPROVE A NOR MUSCULAR FUNCTION AND PROVE BRAIN FUNCTION FOR THAT MATTER IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THERRE A LOT OF PARALLELS IN CREATING THE HEALTHY PSYCHOLOGICAL SELF SO WHAT ARE THE CORE COMPONENTS THAT I ANOTHER SHOULD THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING THINK YOU DESCRIBE THEM AS THE STRUCTURE OF THE SELF AND THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SELF AGAIN JUST TO DRAW A PARALLEL F WE WERE TIGE ABOUT PHYSICAL HEALTH WET SOCAY THEIRES CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NERVES AND MUSCLE THAT ALLOWS US TO MOVE OUR LIMBS IF YOU APPLY CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RESISTANCE YOU GET A CERTAIN ADAPTATION WHICH IS THE THE NOR MUSCULAR CONNECTION GET STRONGER THE MUSCLE MIGHT GET BIGGER OR JUST STRONGER ET CETERA FLEXIBILITY YOU KNOW YOU JUST PUSH YOUR RANGE OF MOTION JUST A LITTLE BIT INTO DISCOMFORT YOU DO THAT WE IT SO HAPPENS TO BE THE CASE THAT YOU DO THAT FOR JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES EACH DAY OVER THE COURSE OF ABOUT A WEEK OR SO YOU GET A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FLEXIBILITY O CASE SO IT'S ALL VERY CLEAR IN THE PHYSICAL DOMAIN IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DOMAIN I HEAR YOU TELLING US THAT THE ACTION STEPS THAT WE ALL SHOULD BE TAKING IN ORDER TO BE THE HAPPIEST VERSION OF OURSELFES BY ACHIEVING AGENCY AND GRATITUDE IS TO EXPLORE THE STRUCTURE OF SELF AND THE FUNCTION OF SELF SO F YOU COULD TELL US ABOUT WHAT IS THE STRUCTURE OF SELF LIKE WHAT GOES IN TO ANDREW BING ANDREW AND PAUVING PAUL AND WHOEVERTHE LISTENER IS INTO BEING WHO THEY ARE WHAT IS THAT AND WHAT IS THE FUNCTION OF SELF HOW HOW DOES THE PSYCHITRS THINK ABOUT THAT HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT THAT IF I COULD START MA  TO SET THE STAGE FOR THAT RGT BY POINTING OUT THAT AS WE GO UP THE HIERARCHY RIGHT OF HEALTH RIGHT EVERYTHING SHOULD GET SIMPLER RIGHT NOT MORE COMPLICATED RIGHT DIF YOU THINK ABOUT PHYSICAL HEALTH RIGHT THERE'S SO MUCH COMPLEXITY ON THE INITIAL LEVELS RIGHT SO WE THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH STATUS VERSE IS MIND RIGHT IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT BUT WE CAN HAVE DIFFERENT CARDIAC FUNCTION AND MUSCLE FUNCTION AND PULMENARY FUNCTION AND FOR GOING TO BE HEALTHY WE COULD DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS RIGHT THERE MIGHT BE WHOLE SET OF CHOICES THAT WOULD WORK WELL FOR YOU DIFFERENT CHOICES THAT WOULD WORK FOR ME AND WE CAN GAUGE INTENSITY TIMING FREQUENCY RIGHT ITS VERY COMPLICATED WHEN WE'RE ON THE THE LOWER LEVELS OF THE HIERARCHY AS WE GET HIGHER UP LET SAY YOU AND I BOTH DO THE RIGHT THINGS RIGHT THAND WHAT HAPPENS WE BOTH HAVE ENDURANCE RIGHT WE BOTH HAVE SOME STRENGTH WERE BOTH ROBUS RIGHT THINGS ARE GETTING SIMPLER BECAUSE WERE WERE WERE APPROACHING THE UNIQUE IDIOSYNCRASIES IN ALL OF US RIGHT AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT AND LOOK AT THAT IN VERY SPECIFIC WAY BUT WHAT WERE TRYING TO GET TO IS IS SOMETHING THAT'S COMMON FOR ALL OF US SO STAMINA FOR EXAMPLE IN PHYSICAL HEALTH AND ENDURANCE RIGHT AND AGENCY AND GRATITUDE IN MENTAL HEALTH RIGHT SO THET IF WE GO AND WE LOOK AND WE LOOK AT THE STRUCTURE OF THE SELF AND THE FUNCTION OF SELF WE FIND THAT THERE'S MORE COMPLEXITY BUT THAT IT IS ALSO UNDERSTANDA WOMAN THIS TREMENDOUS COMPLEXITY IN THE BODY JUST AS THERE'S TREMENDOUS COMPLEXITY IN THE MIND AND WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THE STRUCTURE OF SELF WHAT IS THE FUNCTION OF SELF AND WE CAN LOOK AT THAT AND E CESS THAT IN THE SAME WAY WE WOULD PHYSICAL HEALTH PERAMETERS SO THAT WE ARRIVE AT THE PLACE WE WANT TO BE BE IT ENDURANCE OR AGENCY OR GRATITUDE SO STRUCTURE OF SELF RIGHT WE ALL HAVE AN UNCONSCIOUS MIND RIGHT AND WE PAY SO LITTLE ATTENTION TO THIS PART OF US THAT REALLY IS THE BIOLOGICAL SUPERCOMPUTE RIGHT SO MILLIONS OF THINGS ARE GOING ON ALL THE TIME OOKIN EVERY SPLIT SECOND SO FOR EXAMPLE I CAN SAY THESE WORDS RIGHT YOU CAN LISTEN TO THE WORDS YOU CAN SAY THINGS BACK AND I CANLESS AND RIGHT THER MILLIONS AN MILLIONS OF THINGS GOING ON UNDER THE SURFACE MUCH OF WHICH COMES FROM EITHER BIOLOGICAL PREDISPOSITIONS RIGHT OR HABITS OVER TIME RIGHT THOUGHT PROCESS IS PATTERNS RIGHT SO THIS UNCONSCIOUS MIND THIS SUPERCOMPUT ER IS DOING ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT CAN O AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT RIGHT THEIR ELECTRICAL AND CHEMICAL SIGNALS AND IN A MULTIBLE PATHWAYS AS COMMON AS AS COMPLICATED AS SUPERHIGHWAY SYSTEMS THAT THEN GET CONSOLIDATE AND COMMUNICATE WITH OTHERS RIGHT IND THEN WHAT COMES UP FROM ALL OF THAT IS THE CONSCIOUS MIND SO IMAGINE IN ICEBERG RIGHT I IT'S A REALLY REALLY BIG ICEBERG RIGHT AND AND WE SEE THE PART ABOVE THE SURFACE RIGHT THAT'S THE CONSCIOUS MIND RIGHT BUT THERE'S A HUGE PART OF THIS ICEBERG MAY BE NINETY FIVE PER CENT OF IT THAT'S UNDERNEATH THE WATER RIGHT THAT THERE'S THIS HULKING MASS THAT WE DON'T SEE THAT'S THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND RIGHT AND IT'S SPEEDING UP TO THE CONSCIOUS MIND WHICH I'S A MUCH SMALLER PART OF OUR BRAINFUNCTION RIGHT BUT IT'S THE PART THAT WE'RE AWARE OF RIGHT IT'S SITTING ON TOP OF ALL THE UNCONSCIOUS THINGS WHICH ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BUT THEN WE BECOME AWARE SO THAT WE CAN ENGAGE IN THE REAL WORLD IN ORDER FOR US TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION THE MILLIONS OF THINGS PER SECOND HAVE TO BE GOING ON UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE SO THAT YOU AND I AS CONSCIOUS EYES RIGHT AS CONSCIOUSSELVES CAN RIDE ALONG ON TOP OF IT SO THAT'S THE PART OF THE ICEBERG THAT'S ABOVE THE WATER IT'S THE CONSCIOUS SELF THEN IMAGINE THAT THE CONSCIOUS SELF IS GIRDED BY BY A AS A SET OF A IN A LONG A TENDRILS THAT COME OUT FROM UNDER THE WATER RIGHT THAT THEIR DEFENCE MECHANISMS THAT ARE UNCONSCIOUS TO US THAT SUT OF GIRD THE CONSCIOUS MIND SO DO WE RATIONALIZE AUTOMATICALLY DO WE AVOID AUTOMATICALLY DO WE ACT OUT AUTOMATICALLY ARE THESE THINGS IN US IN WAYS THAT WE CAN OBSERVE AND CHANGE BUT THAT ARE THERE THE TRYAND PROTECT THE CONSCIOUS MIND FROM THE SLINGS AND ARROWS OF THE WORLD AROUND US RIGHT SO IF Y IMAGINE THERE'S THE BIG PART OF THE ICEBERG UNDER THE WATER THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND THE CONSCIOUS MIND IS RIDING ON TOP OF IT BUT THE CONSCIOUS MIND THAT PART STECKING OUT OF THE WATER IS VULNERABLE RIGHT SO IMAGINE THAT THERE'S A DEFENSIVE STRUCTURE THAN THAT ARISES FROM THE PART OF THE ICEBERG THAT'S UNDER WATER THAT IS THERE TO DEFEND AND PROTECT THE CONSCIOUS MIND SO WHEN YOU SAY TO DEFEND AND PROTECT WHEN YOU SAY THAT THE CONSCIOUS MIND IT'S VULNERABLE WHAT DO YOU MEAN DO YOU MEAN THAT IT'S VULNERABLE TO PHYSICAL ATTACK OR THAT IT'S VULNERABLE TO US REALIZING THAT WE'RE JUST A BUNCH OR NARANS THAT ARE INCLICKING AWAY UNDERNEATH LIKE IN OTHER WORDS WHERE DOES THE VULNERABILITY OF THE CONSCIOUS MIND REALLY RESIDE EM NOT PHYSICALLY WHERE DOES IT RESIDE BUT YOU WHAT AM I SO WORRIED ABOUT IN TERMS OF MY SAFETY I MIN REN HOUR IND ROOM I FEEL PRETTY SAFE UM I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOIN TO ATTACK ME VERBLY OR PHYSICALLY I SUPPOSE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT COULD HAPPEN BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY DISTANT POSSIBILITY SO WHEN YOU SAY THAT THESE DEFENSES ARE THERE TO PROTECT US FROM SOME SORT OF AWARENESS WHAT A WARENESS ARE WE TRYING TO AVOID SO THAT THE VULNERABILITY OF THE CONSCIOUS MIND IS TO FEAR CONFUSION DESPAIR RIGHT THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT THAT WE CAN FEAR RIGHT SOME PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF SNAKES OR SPIDERS SOME PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF DEATH SOME PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF HEALTHY SHUES THAT COULD COME TO THEM OR TO PEOPLE THEY LOVE WE GET CONFUSE AND NOT KNOW WHAT DECISIONS TO MAKE AND HOW TO NAVIGATE THE WORLD AND HOW TO BE WHO WE WANT TO BE OURSELVES AND TO OTHERS RIGHT WE CAN FEEL TREMENDOUSLY VULNERABLE AND DESPAIRING IF WE LOSE OTHERS OR WE KNOW WE START TO SEE THINGS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD AROUND US THAT THAT THAT WE DON'T LIKE WHY WE START TO FEE LIKE WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE PLANET WE LIVE ON WER THER'LL BE WAR WHERE I LIVE WELL MY CHILDREN BE SAFE RIGHT THERE'S SO MUCH THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT OURSELVES AGAIN SO THAT VULNERABLE PART OF OF US RIGHT THE PART OF THE ICEBERG STECKING OUT ABOVE THE WATER NEEDS A DEFENSIVE STRUCTURE AROUND IT TO PROTECT IT AGAINST THE VULNABILITY OF FEAR CONFUSION DESPAIR RIGHT AND BECAUSE THE CONSCIOUS MIND THIS IS SEKING OUT OF THE WATER WITH THE DEFENSIVE STRUCTURE AROUND IT RIGHT IT IS THE THE WRAW MATERIAL FROM WHICH WE CREATE OUR CHARACTER STRUCTURE SO THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE IS ALL OF THAT THE PART UNDER THE WATER THE PART ABOVE THE WATER THE DEFENSIVE STRUCTURE SO IMAGINE A NEST AROUND ALL OF THAT AND THAT'S THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE THAT WE UTILIZE TO INTERFACE WITH THE WORLD RIGHT SO THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE IS THE THING THAT I'M USING RISSIC IF YOU'RE DRIVING SOMEWHERE IN A CAR RIGHT THE CAR IS THE THING THAT YOU'RE USING TO GO THET RIGHT THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE IS THE THING THAT WE'RE USING TO INTERFACE WITH THE WORLD SO FOR EXAMPLE HOW TRUSTING AM I VERSES SUSPICIOUS RIGHT HOW READILY DO I COME TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH PEOPLE RIGHT HOW I HOW MUCH DO I ACT OUT IF I'M FRUSTRATED RIHT HOW MUCH DO I UM YOULL EXCLAIM SOMETHING NEGATIVE IHT IS SUPPOSED TO HOLDING IT INSIDE OF ME HOW MUCH DO I RATIONALIZE IF SOMETHING ISN'T GOING WELL DO I WANT OF LOOK AT IT AND MAY BE SEE THAT IT IS SO THAT I DON'T HAVE TO FACE IT RIGHT HOW MUCH DO I AVOID PROBLEMS IN THE WORLD AROUND ME HOW MUCH DO I EXERCISE AUTRUISM RIGHT THAT THESE ARE ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH WE'RE ENGAGING WITH THE WORLD AROUND US AND THIS DETERMINES THE SELF IMAGINE THAT THE SELF THEN GROWS OUT OF THIS NEST FROM THE THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE THAT WE USED TO INTERFACE WITH THE WORLD AND THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE SO FOR CHARACTER STRUCTURE IS IS THE THING THROUGH WHICH WE ENGAGE WITH THE WORLD THEN WE'RE ENACTING WHAT IS INSIDE OF US WHAT WE'VE DETERMINED THROUGH OUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND OR CONSCIOUS MIND ARE DEFENSE MECHANISM THE THE CERTAIN US THAT THAT COMES AT THE WORLD IN A CERTAIN WAGHT AND IF WE'RE MORE OR LESS TRUSTING MORE OR LESS AVOIDANT WE RATIONALIZE MORE OR LESS THESE ARE THE FACTORS THAT DETERMINE E WERE WHERE DO OUR LIVES GO RIGHT BECAUSE ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS IMAGINE THAT THE NEST OF THE CHARCTER STRUCTURE AROUN ND ALL OF THIS GROWS FROM IT THE SELF RIGHT THE PRODUCT OF THE FEELINGS INSIDE THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW ABOUT OURSELVES AND DON'T KNOW ABOUT OURSELVES THE DECISIONS THAT ALL OF IT LEADS TO SO I MAY CHOOSE TO BE FOR EXAMPLE MORE TRUSTING AND THAT MAY BRING AN OPPORTUNITY TO ME THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE OTHERWISE HAD RIGHT I MAY CHOOSE TO BE MORE TRUSTING AND IT MAY BRING RISK TO ME THAT I WOULDN'T OTHERWISE HAVE HAD SO WE WANTOD BE IS HEALTHY AS WE CAN AS KNOWLEDGIBLE OF OURSELVES IN THE WORLD AROUND US SO THAT IT'S SAFE FOR US TO HAVE A HEALTHY CHARACTER STRUCTURE THROUGH WHICH WE CAN ENGAGE IN THE WORLD AROUND US WITH A SENSE OF PRUDENCE RIGHT TAKING REASONABLE RISKS RIGHT NOT TOO LITTLE SO THAT WE SHUT OURSELVES DOWN AND MAY BE ND UP DESPAIRING NOT SO MUCH THAT THAT SCARY THINGS CAN HAPPEN TO US AND WE AND UP FEARFUL RIGHT BUT THE IDEA THAT IF WE KNOW OURSELVES WELL THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE IS HEALTHY RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S BUILT UPON A STRUCTURE OF SELF IN A FUNCTION OF SELF THAT ARE HEALTHY AND OUT OF IT IS COMING EMPOWERMENT RIGHT AN EMPOWERMENT AND HUMILITY RIGHT THAT THEN LEAD US TO AGENCY AND GRATITUDE RIGHT THE IDEA HERE IS THAT THIS IS THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE THAT WE CREATE THAT CAN THAN INTERFACE WITH THE WORLD IN A WAY THAT'S GOOD FOR US AND GOOD FOR THE WORLD AROUND US THAT LEADS US TO BE ABLE TO LIVE IN MUCH MORE HARMONY INSIDE OF OURSELVES AND OUTSIDE OF OURSELVES SO IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY DEFENSE MECHANISMS THAT GROW UP OUT OF THIS PORTION OF THE ICEBERG TH RECALLING THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND THEY PROTECT ARE CONSCIOUSSELF IN WAYS THAT CAN BE ADAPTIVE OR THAT CAN BE MALADAPTIVE ANOTHER WORD DEFENCES CAN BE HELD AT YOUR THAT CAN BE UNHEALTHY YES AND A PERHAPS IN A A FEW MANSE WE CAN GET INTO WHAT A HEALTHY VERSES AND UNHEALTHY DEFENSE LOOKS LIKE BUT THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE CHARACTER STRUCTURE SOUNDS TO ME LIKE AN A RAY OF CONTEXTUAL DISPOSITION NS I DON'T WANT TO ADD UNNECESSARILY A COMPLEX LANGUAGE BUT IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE A BUNCH OF DISPOSITIONS LIKE TIK IF I'M WALK INTO THE OFFICE WHERE I KNOW EVERYBODY AND I SEE FAMILIAR FACES THERE'S NO REASON FOR ME TO BE ON GUARD IF I TRUST THOSE PEOPLE BUT IF I'M WALKING DOWN A A A STREET AT NIGHT THAT I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH AND AND I'M TRYING TO GET THE SENSE THAT YOU KNOW THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST IT MAKE SENSE FOR ME TO BE ON RELATIVELY HIGH ALERT SO DIFFERENT DISPOSITIONS DEPENDING ON DIFFERENT CONDITIONS I CAN'T HELP BUT MENTION MY A BULLDOG COSTELLO WHO HAD BASICLLY THREE DISPOSITIONS WAS ASLEEP BUT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THE SECOND ONE WAS A CANT A BOARD THE BULLDOG FACE  CIN BOARD OR IF SOMETHING WAS GIVEN TO HIM THAT HE LIKED OR IF WE WERE DOING SOMETHING LIKE DELIGHT HE BUSY HAD THREE DISPOSITIONS AS FAR AS I COULD TELL I I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS WE LIKE DOGS SO MUCH OR THAT MANY OF US LIKE DOG SO MUCH AS THAT THERE DECISIONS ARE VERY PREDICTABLE TAKE HIM TO THE PARK HE'S HAPPY UNLESS HE HAPPEN TO BE ILL THAT DAY WHICH WAS RARE A YOU KNOPEEDAM HE'S HAPPY THERE WASN'T A LOT OF I DON'T LIKE THIS PARTICULAR MEAL OR ANNT LIKE THIS PARTICULAR PARK OR THIS BIJAN FRIZEY DOESN'T SMELL SO GOOD TO ME YOU KNW ITHERE'S A IT WAS SO SIMPLE AND AND YET PEOPLE ARE VERY COMPLEX RIGHT I I I CAN LOOK AT MYSELF AND SAY O CAT WHAT A WHAT IS MY CHARACTER STRUCTURE OF CHARACTER STRUCTURE IS CERTAIN THINGS I LIKE CERTAIN THINGS I DISLIKE CERTAN THINGS REALLY IRRITATE ME CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTS AN PEOPLE I JUS DELIGHT AND O CAS SAID IS THE DEFINITION OF A HEALTHY CHARACTER STRUCTURE ONE IN WHICH THE DISPOSITIONS MATCH THE CONTEXT PERFECTLY I MAY N'T KNOW HOW ANY OF US COULD BE LIKE THAT BUT IS IS THAT SORT OF THE IDEAL MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT UNM YOU KNOW WE COULD PROBABLY ARRIVE AT AT AN IDEAL DEGREE OF STAMINA THAT ONE COULD HAVE HIM N SOME PEOPLE WANT RUN ULTRAMARITHONS A HUNDRED MILES OR MORE SOME BE WANT O RUN A MARITHON SOME YO LIKE ME DON'T REALLY DESIRE TO RUN A MARITHON BUT I WANT TO BE ABLE TO RUN A MILE IF I NEED TO WITHOUT BEING COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED AND INJURED SO YOU KNOW WHEN WE WHEN WE ASK OURSELVES ABOUT CHARACTER STRUCTURE ARE WE ASKING OURSELVES ABOUT CONTAXT DRIVEN DISPOSITIONS AND YOURE HOW WE STRAR TO AVALUATE THAT FOR OURSELVES I THINK BECAUSE WE'RE MORE COMPLICATED I THINK IT'S NOT DISPOSITIONS AS MUCH AS ITS PREDISPOSITIONS RIGHT SO SO IN THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE RIGHT YOU'VE A CERTAIN PREDISPOSITION TO BE EITHER TRUSTING OR WEARY RIGHT AN AND YOU'RE AND THAT'S HEALTHY IN YOU RIGHT SO WHEN YOU COME INTO A SETTING WERE THERE'S NOT A GOOD REASON TO FEEL MISTRUSTFUL TO FEEL ANXIOUS TO FEEL VULNERABLE RIGHT THAN YOU FEEL AT EASE RIGHTA A YOU WALK INTO THE WORK SETTING THEIR PEOPLE YOU KNOW OTHER PEOPLE YOU LIKE EVERYTHING IS OQUE RIGHT YOU'VE A DIFFERENT PREPREDISPOSITION WHEN THE CONTEXT IS DIFFERENT RIGHT SO IF THE CONTEXT COULD BRING A LACK OF SAFETY THAN YOU RESPOND ACCORDINGLY WITH THE LACK OF SAFETY RIHT BUT BUT IT'S POSSIBLE CERTAINLY THOSE PREDISPOSITIONS CAN BE IN UNHEALTHY PLACES RIGHT SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN TROMATIZED IN A CERTAIN WAY OR YOU MIGHT APPROACH THE WORLD IN A CERTAIN WAY BECAUSE A PRIOR EXPERIENCE THAT YOU MAY NOT REGISTER AS TRAMA BUT IT MAY BE THAT WITHIN YOU IS A PREDISPOSITION TO BE MISTRUSTFUL SO YOU COULD WALK INTO A ROOM OF PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW OF PEOPLE WHOV NEVER MET YOU ANY HARM AND STILL FEEL ON SAFE RIGHT NOW THIS HAPPENS MOST OFTEN AFTER TRAMA BUT THER'RE OTHER WAYS PEOPLE CAN GET TO THAT WHERE THE PREDISPOSITION ISN'T SO HEALTHY THE CONVERSE IS TRUE TOO RIGHT THERE PEOPLE WHO CAN HAVE TOO MUCH OF WHAT'S CALLED AN OMNIPOTENCE DEFENSE AND THEN THEY DON'T RECOGNIZE DANGER WHEN DANGER IS AROUND THEM SO THE IDEA THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE THAT NEST RIGHT THAT'S BUILT AROUND THE DEFENSE OF STRUCTURE AND THE CONSCIOUS MIND THAT SITTING ON TOP OF THE PART OF THE ICEBERG THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND UNDER WATER RIGHT IT'S THAT NEST THAT IS INTERFACING WITH THE WORLD THROUGH A WHOLE SET OF PREDISPOSITIO NS I'D LIKE TO TAKE A BRIEF BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS  G ONE A G ONE IS A VITEMIN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT MEETS ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITION NEEDS I STARTED TAKING A G ONE WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND IN TWEALTH SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSERING THE POD CAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING A G ONE AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE A G ONE ONCE OR GENERALLY TWICE PER DAY IS THAT IT'S THE EASIEST WAY FOR ME TO INSURE THAT I'M GETTING ALL OF THE VITAMENS MINERALS PROBIOTIS AND FIBR THAT I NEED IN MY DIET NOW OF COURSE IT'S ESSENTIAL TO GET PROPER NUTRITION FROM WHOLE FOODS BUT MOST PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF FIND IT HARD TO GET ENOUGH SERVINGS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES EACH DAY AND ESPECIALLY TO GET ENOUGH PREBIOTICS AND PROBIOTICS TO INSURE GOT HEALTH AS YOU MAY KNOW YOUR GOT CONTAINS TRILIANS OF LITTLE MICROBIODA THE SO CALLED GUP MICROBYOM WHICH ESTABLISHES CRITICAL CONNECTIONS WITH OTHER ORGANS OF YOUR BODY TO ENHANCE BRAIN HEALTH AS WELL AS TO SUPPORT YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM AND OTHER ASPECTS THAT RELATE TO MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH ONE OF THE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS I GET IS IF YOU WERE TO TAKE JUST ONE SUPPLEMENT WHICH SUPPLEMENT WOULD THAT BE AND MY ANSWER IS ALWAYS A G ONE BECAUSE BY TAKING A G ONE I'M ABLE TO INSURE THAT I'M GETTING ALL F THE VITAMENS MINERALS AND PROBOTICS THAT I NEED TO ENHANCE MY MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY A G ONE GO TO DRINK A G ONE DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEM IN D THREE K TWO AGAIN THAT'S DRINK A G ONE DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER I THINK MOST OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH ASSESSING AND ASSIGNING NAMES TO THE CHARACTER STRUCTURES OF OTHERS AND AT LEAST FROR MOST OF US WE DO THAT WITH NO PROFESSIONAL TRAINING OR AUTHORITY IT WASA THAT PERSON IS GREAT THEY'RE SUPERNICE PERSONS A JERK THE LIKE WEARD NO ET CETERA ET CETERA I THINK VERY FEW OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH ASSESSING OUR OWN CHARACTER STRUCTURE AND I HAVE TO PRESUME THAT SOME OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEBODY COMES TO YOU AS A PSYCHAATERISTER TO A PSYCHOLOGIST IS THA T CERTAIN QUESTIONS ARE ASKED AND CERTAIN NARRATIVES ARE TOLD THAT STARTURE REVEAL TO THE CLINITION THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE AND PERHAPS FROM THEIR SOME OF THE POSSIBLE DEFENSE MECHANISMS AND I YOU KNOW STRUCTURE OF THE PERSONS UNCONSCIOUS MIND AND CONSCIOUS MIND THAT OBVIOUSLY ARE UNAWARE TO THEM BUT WOULD BE CLEAR BY A CLINITION MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT IF SOMEBODY GOES INTO THE DOCTRINES AS YET I DON'T FEEL WELL THE CONSTART PROBING WITH QUESTIONS ARE THEY GAIN TO PUT YOU KNOW TAKE A TAKE A RLIST ANOTHER BREATHING RIGHT NOTHER HEART RIGHT AN I S T OUT THE STETHOSCOPE AND FIGURE IT AN THE PROSE EVER AS THAT THE PSYCHOTRES OF PSYCHOLOGIUS USES WORDS AND LIES TO PROPE IF SO WHAT ARE THE SORTS OF ASPECTS OF CHARACTER STRUCTURE THAT WE CAN BE AWARE OF IN OURSELVES YOU KNOW IT IN OTHER WORDS AM SHOULD WE BE ASKING WHAT TYPE OF CHARACTER DO I HAVE DEPENDENT ON ONE CIRCUMSTANCE OR ANOTHER AM SHOULD WE ASK OURSELVES WHAT SORTS OF DEFENES WE HAVE AND IT MAYBE THIS WOULD BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO UN ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OF WHAT ARE HEALTHY VERSES UNHEALTHY DEFENSES AM BECAUSE IT SOUNDS TO ME IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THAT THE DEFENSE MECHANISMS ARE A VERY STRONG COMPONENT IN DETERMINING WHAT OUR CHARACTER STRUCTURE IS AT BECAUSE THE DEFENSE MECHANISMS ARE UNCONSCIOUS I THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE THAT NEST AROUND THE DEFENSES AND THE CONSCIOUS MIND THROUGH WHICH WE INTERFACE WITH THE WORLD IT IS VERY VERY COMPLICATED SO THERE AS MANY CHARACTER STRUCTURES AS THERE ARE HUMAN BEINGS IT SO IT'S VERY VERY COMPLICATED BUT THERE ARE FACTORS THAT ARE CONSISTENTLY RELEVANT ACROSS PEOPLE AND GET IDENTIFIED AS SUCH SO SO ONE EXAMPLE WOULD BE ISOLATION VERSES AFFILIATION IHT SO TIT DOES THE PERSON TEND TO GROUP WITH OTHERS RIGHT OR DOES THE PERSON TEND TO AVOID GROUPING I AND AND GO ABOUT  THOUGHTS TASKS APPROACHES TO LIFE IN IN A MORE  SINGULAR MANNER RIGHT SO IS JUST ONE ELEMENT OT MAKING VALUE JUDGMENT ABOUT IT CAUSE IT CAN BE GOOD OR B AD ON EITHER END OF THE SPECTRE RIGHT SO WE'RE JUST SAYING WHAT ARE THE FACTORS SO AM I MORE FILIATIVE OR DO I TEND TO ISOLATE AND BE MORE SINGULAR THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE RIGHT ANOTHER EXAMPLE COULD BE THINGS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE USE OF HUMOR RIGHT I DOES A PERSON USE HUMOR AND IN WHAT WAY RIGHT IS A PERSON USE WHO HUMOR TO DEFLECT A DISCOMFORT AND NEGATIVE SITUATIONS IS A PERSON USE HUMOR IN ORDER TO BE LITTLE OTHERS OR TO BE LITTLE THEMSELVES OR IT IS A PERSON NOT USE HUMOR RIGHT SO THER THESE ASPECTS OF CHARACTER STRUCTURE AND SO MUCH RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE ON THIS OVER THE YEARS TO DETERMINE WHAT IS MOST SALIENT RIGHT IN THIS IT IS THING THAT WE USE IN ORDER TO INTERFACE WITH THE WORLD AROUND US UP OUT OF WHICH GROWS OUR SELF I MAKES GOOD SENSE AND I IT MAKES ME WANT TO REVISE A LITTLE BUT WHAT I ASKED ABOUT BEFORE WHICH IS I SAID THAT WHEN IT COMES TO AN EXAMINE OF PHYSICAL HEALTHY MEASURE BLOOD PRESSURE MEASURE U A BREATHING ET CETERA MAYBE EVEN A BLOOD TASK LOOK AT SOME BIOE MARKERS BUT WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS LILBIT MORE ANALOGOUS TO A'M THE PHYSICIAN A ADDRESSING A PATIENT WHOS HAVING SOME PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT OR MALAYS AN SAYING TELL ME ABOUT YOUR DAY YO  WHAT D YOU DO WHEN YOU GET UP IN THE MORNING IF THE PRISONS AS WELL YOU KNOW I I DRINKA YOU KNOW QUARTER PINT OF VODKA AN HE IS A VERY DIFFERENT ANSWER THAN IU I GO OUTSIDE AND GET SOMELIGHT IN MEYES DRINK A GLASS OF WATER AN MAY BE HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE RIGHT YOU KNOW AM OR IF SOMEBODY SAYS I HAVE SSIXCESSPRESSO IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THE CARTER STRUCTURE IS BETTER REVEALED BY EXPLORING THE ACTION STATES N TAT SOME COMING TALIZE AN ISOLATION VERSES ENGAGEMENT A AS OPPOSED TO A READ OF ONE SPECIFIC BILE MARKER YEAM IS HAS DE STRUCTURE BROUGHT TO LIFE RIGHT YES I IMMEDIATELY IN THINKING ABOUT MOVIES IN BOOKS WHERE WE LEARN SO MUCH ABOUT SOMEBODY THROUGH OBSERVING THE WAY THAT THEY INTERACT WITH PEOPLE IN IN VERY A VERY POTENT WAYS SO FOR INSTANCE I CAN THINK OF COUNTLESS MOVIES WHERE OF YOU LEARN A HUN ABOUT SOMEBODY IN THE FIRST SCENE SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY REACT OF SOMEBODY WHO E CUTS THEM OFF ON IN TRAFFIC THEY JUST EXPLODE LOOK KAN WELL THEN WE THINK OF THAT PERSON AS REACTIVE FROM THAT POINT ON UNLESS THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MATERIAL TO REVISE THAT BUT IT'S IN THE ACTION OF OF OF GETTING EXPLOSIVE AND CURSING ET CETERA I SUPPOSIF THEY JUST CON WET LAUGH AT OFF OR LAUGH AT THEMSELVES OR BLAME SOME ONE WITHIN THEIR OWN VEHICLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO IS ARE THOSE THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT ACCLINITION LIKE YOURSELF AS LISTENING FOR WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS YOU ONT FEEL WELL AN YOU SO WILL TELL ME ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON LATELY AND THEY START DESCRIBING WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR LIFE AND ARE YOU LISTENING FOR THOSE PLACES WHERE THE DETHE DEFENSE MECHANISMS CAN ARE STRART STRURK TO REVEAL THEMSELVES THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE STRARTS TO REVEAL ITSELF THROUGH THESE ACTION STEPS THAT THE PERSON SEEMS TO BE TAKING ISN'T YOU YO MAYBE ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT AT CHARACTER STRUCTURE IS THAT IT'S IT'S POTENTIALITIES AND PREDISPOSITIONS RIGHT THAT THERE'S SO MUCH THAT THAT'S LATENT THAT THEN INTERFACES WITH EVENTS LIKE THE PERSON STUCK IN TRAFFIC HOW DOES THAT PERSON RESPOND IF THAT PERSON WEREN'T STUCK IN TRAFFIC THERE WOULDN'T BE A RESPONSE TO IT IY SOTH SO THEIR POTENTIALITIES THEIR PREDISPOSITIONS AND THEN WE LIVE THROUGH ENACTING THEM AS WE'RE MOVING THEN THROUGH LIFE RIGHT AND THE ATTEMPTS TO UNDERSTAND SO TUSING THE PHYSICAL HEALTH PARALLEL RIGHT IF YOU CAME IN YOU SAID II DON'T FEEL WELL RIGHT WHER WE MIGHT RUN A LOT OF TESTS RIGHT WE MIGHT GET IN EM OR EYE OR CATSCAND OR EVEN PUTTING THE STETHOSCOPE AND LISTENING TO US INSIDE OF YOU THOSE WEAK AS THEY ARE UNCONSCIOUS THINGS THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF WHAT THE IMAGING MAY SHOW OR THE BLOOD TESTS MAY SHOW OR HOW YOUR LUNGS MAY SOUND WHEN SOME ONE PUT THE STETHOSCOPE ON THAT RIGHT SO SO A CLINITION IF YOUE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND HELP SOMEONE THEN YOU DO WANT TO LOOK FOR THOSE THINGS RUTT YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR THE THINGS THAT ARE UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE BUT THAT BE THE CAN BE VERY VERY IMPORTANT RIGHT YOU ALSO WANT A LOOK AT EVERYTHING THAT'S ON THE SURFACE RIGHT SO IF YOU'R IF YU'RE ENGAGING WITH SOME ONE YOU'RE ENGAGING WITH THE SELF RIGHT THE SELF THAT GROWS OUT OF THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE NEST RIHT SO BY ENGAGING WITH AND AND DOING ONE'S BEST TO UNDERSTAND THE SELF THEN YOU LEARN ABOUT WHAT IS UNDERNEATH OF IT RIGHT SO I MAY THEN LEARN WHOW DO YOU RESPONDIN CERTAIN SITUATIONS RIGHT JUST LIKE I COULD ASKYONG QUESTIONS O WO WHEN DO YOU NOT FEEL WELL OR RIGTS OYOYOU'RE ASKING A PERSON QUESTIONS BECAUSE THE IDEA IS TO UNDERSTAND ELEMENTS OF THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE SO HW D YOU RESPOND IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF YOU RIGHT WHAT YOU UNDERSTAND ABOUT YOURSELF AND WHAT YOU NOT UNDERSTAND ABOUT YOURSELF RIGHT HOW DO YOU BRING YOURSELF TO BEAR IN THE WORLD AROUND YOU SO THERE'S A SIMILAR PROCESS GOING ON BUT HERE WT WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE SELF AND THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE SELF CAN HELPLESS UNDERSTAND THE COMPONENTS UNDERNEATH OF THE SELF BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GO TO MAKE THINGS BETTER RIGHT THE IDEA IS THERE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE MYSTERY OR CERTAINLY NOT MYSTERY ANY MORE THAN THERE IS IN PHYSICAL HEALTH I MEAN YOUKNOW RARELY SOME ONE COMES IN AND THEE REALLY NOT FEELING WELL AND AND A WHOLE SET OF EVERYTHING THAT SHOULD BE DONE IS DONE RIGHT LABS PHYSICAL EXAMINATION HISTERY IMAGING RIGHT AND AN YOU STILL JUST DON'T KNOW RIGHT MEANS SOMETIMES THAT CAN HAPPEN BUT ITS VERY RARE AND THE SAME SHOULD APPLY HERE THAT IF WE'RE EXAMINING A SELF RIGHT AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE COMPONENTS OUT OF WHICH THAT SELF COMES RIGHT THEND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WELL ENOUGH TO GO BACK TO THE COMPONENTS OF SELF AND TO MAKE CHANGE SO THAT THE SELF IS IN A BETTER PLACE RIGHT AND AND THAT SELF CAN THEN BE EMPOWERED CAN FEEL HUMILITY RIGHT CAN THEN COME AT LIFE THROUGH THE ALTERISM AND GRATITUDE THAT WE SEE BECAUSE AGAIN YOU SHOW ME SOME ONE WHO'SE COMING AT LIFE THROUGH ALTERUISM AND GRATITUDE AND IS NOT APPY WITH THEIR LIFE AND YOU'LL BE SHOWING ME SOMETHING I'VE NEVER SEEM BEFORE SOMETHING ENTIRELY KNEW SO IF WE WANT TO GET THERE WE WANT TO KNOW HOW TO GET THERE AND THERE ARE WAYS AS THERE SHOULD BE THAT PARALLEL PHYSICAL HEALTH THAT AREN'T MYSTERIOUS THAT WE CAN COME AT TO MAKE UNDERSTANDING AND CHANGE I'M WONDERING ABOUT THE ROLL OF ANXIETY IN ALL F THIS THE REASON I ASK ABOUT ANXIETY IS THAT YOU SAID THAT SO MUCH OF CHARACTER STRUCTURE IS DETERMINED BY SET O PREDISPOSITIONS AND POTENTIALITIES AND EARLIER WERE TALKING ABOUT EXAMPLE OF EITHER BEING AFRAID ORE UNAFRAID IN PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENTS OR FEELING LIKE WE CAN WALK INTO A CLASS FROM AND LEARN OR WHETHER NOT WE'RE OVERLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT US OR BOTH I COULD BE AMEX I'M WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN EMBRACE NOVEL ENVIRONMENTS IN SAFE AND ADAPTIVE WAYS WHETHER NOT WE CAN GROW FROM THEM I SUPPOSE TO WHETHER NOT WE CAN BE OVERTAKEN BY THEM OR PERHAPS EVEN INJURED HARM PSYCHOLOGICALLY PHYSICALLY OR BOTH ANXIETY TO ME IS IT IS A VERY BASIC FUNCTION I THINK ABOUT INTERMR THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND DEGREES OF EXCITEABILITY AND ET CETERA AN ABILITY O SLEEP AT NIGHT IN ABILITY TO WAKE UP FEELING REASONABLY GOOD BUT NOT HAVE A PANIC ATTACK BUT ANXIETY TO ME DOES SEEM LIKE A KEEN NOTE IN ALL OF THIS MEANING YUOW I MOST PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF I DON'T WALK AROUND THINKING ABOUT MY CHARACTER STRUCTURE I DON'T WALK AROUND THINKING ABOUT HOW I'M GOING TO BEHAVE IN A BUNCH OF HYPOTHETICAL ENVIRONMENTS THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT MOST MORNINGS I WAKE UP AND I FEEL PRETTY GOOD TO BE QUITE HONEST NOT AS GOOD AS I WOULD LIKE TO FEEL THEN ACERLALY BECAUSE ANYTHING'S WRONG BUT BECAUSE I THINK I'M WIRE TO BE A LITTEBIT MORE ON THE ANXIOUS SIDE AND TO PREDICT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND SO UNTIL I'M ACTUALLY ENGAGING IN CERTAIN BEHAVIORS THAT ANXIETY HUMS A LITTLE BIT HIGH FOR ME THE GEARS TURN A LITTLE BIT FASTER PERHAPS THAN I WOULD LIKE WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING BUT ONCE I ENGAGE I FEEL LIKE THAT THE SPEED OF THAT YEAR TURNING I MATCHES THE DEMANDS OF LIFE DPRETTY WELL I FEEL U AGENCY OK A SO IF YOU DON'T MIND COULD WE EXPLORE THIS THIS FEELING OF ANXIETY OR LACK OF ANXIETY THAT I THINK PEOPLE ARE PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH WITHIN THEMSELVES DIFFERENT TIMES OF DAY AN AN UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS YETS TO ME IT SEEMS LIKE A UM AN INTERESTING LENDS TO TO EXPLORE THIS NOTION OF CHARACTER STRUCTURE AND DEFENCES IS ANXIETY A HEALTHY DEFENSE OR AN UNHEALTHY DEFENSE OR DOES IT SIMPLY DEPEND ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES WELL WE ALL HAVE SOME DEGREE OF ANXIETY IN US RI WE WE ALL HAVE SOME AWARENESS THAT WE'RE NAVIGATING THE WORLD AND LIKE NOT EVERYTHING IS IS PERFECT RIGHT THIS IS NOT NIRVANA SO THERE'S SOME ANXIETY WITHIN US AND THE THOUGHT IS THAT THAT ANXIETY CAN KEEP US VIGILANT ABOUT THE THINGS WE SHOULD BE VIGILANT ABOUT YOU KNOW HEALTH AND SAFETY RIGHT BUT THAT TOO MUCH ANXIETY THEN BECOMES COUNTER PRODUCTIVE AND WE CAN LOOK AT THIS IN A VERY REGIMENTED WAY RIGHT SO SO SOME ANXIETY MAKE SENSE RIGHT IT KEEPS US BEING CAREFUL I KEEPS YOU BECAUSE YOU BEING CAREFUL AS YOU'RE PULLING OUT OF A DRYEWAY FOR EXAMPLE RGHT SO OQET IT CAN BE IT CAN BE ABSOLUTELY FINE BUT LET'S SAY YOU BRING SOMETHING TO CLINICAL ATTENTION THAT ISN'T ABSOLUTELY FINE RIGHT LET'S SAY I DIDN'T KNOW YOU AND YOU COME IN WE HAVE THE EXAMPLE THAT THAT WE THAT YOU USE BEFORE WHERE WHERE YOU YOU WALK IN TO WORK AND THERE'S THE  GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT YOU THAT YOU KNOW WELL AND LIKE RIGHT LET'S SAY YOU TOLD ME WHEN I WALK IN THERE I I FEEL VERY ANXIOUS RIGHT I DON'T FEEL LIKE THINGS ARE OQUET RIGHT SO THEN WE WOULD GO THRRE WE SAIT THAT'S NOT GOOD RIGHT MAYBES IMPACTING A PROFESSIONAL LIFE THINGS ARE NOT GOING WELL IF YOU REALLY WANT THIS TO CHANGE TAS IS IMPACTING YOUR LIFE IN A NEGATIVE WAY WE SAY OQET LET'S LOOK AT THAT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF STRUCTURE OF SELF RIGHT SO FIRST UNCONSCIOUS RIGHT IS IT THAT JUST JUNETICALLY ARE YOU BUILT WITH JUST HIGHER LEVELS OF ANXIETY RIGHT SO WE COULD LEARN LOOK I HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN ANX JUST LIKE THIS IS AS AS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN IN YOUR LIFE SINCE YOU WERE A LITTLE KID NO MATTER WHAT SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR BIOLOGICAL NATURE SO TO SPEAK VARIABLES WE MIGHT ALSO LOOK FOR THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU THAT ARE LODGED IN YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND RGHT IS THER TRAMA THAT YOU HAVEN'TPROCESS RIGHT THAT NOW IS UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE BUT IS SPINNING OFF MORE ANXIETY RIGHT IT ET LET' SAY YOU TELL ME O IT IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO YOU START AT BEING ANXIOUS IIT DID SOMETHING HAPPENE THA DID YOU WALK INTO A GROUP OF PEOPLE AND IT ARE YOU TRIPPED AND YOU FELT BAD ABOUT SOMETHING RIGHT AND THEN THEN YOU GET MORE ANXIOUS RIGHT SO ARE THERE THINGS GOING ON UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE THAT ARE IMPACTING YOU LIKE LET'S LET'S LOOK INTO THAT RIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S THE BIGGEST PART OF THE ICEBERG RIGHT THEN YOUR CONSCIOUS MIND WE COULD START THINKING ABOUT  WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON WHAT YOU ACTIVELY THINKING ABOUT RIGHT SO THIS WERE SOMETIMES COGNITEVE BEHAVIOURL TECHNIQUES CAN CAN COME INTO MIND LIKE ARE YOU THINKING LIKE OH NO I'M SCARED ISN'T GINGTO GO WHILE RELIC I HAVING THOUGHTS OF THE THOUGHTS AND MAKING YOU MORE ANXIOUS RIGHT WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR CONSCIOUS MIND RIGHT I WOULD ALSO BE VERY INTERESTED IN THE DEFENCES AROUND YOU SO FOR EXAMPLE DO YOU TEND TO AVOID RIGHT HAS THIS BEEN GETTING WORSE FOR THREE MONTHS BUT BUT YOU JUST YOURR MIND WOULDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE IT RIGHT AND BY THE TIME YOU HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT NOW IT'S REALLY BAD RIGHT OR  DO YOU NOT AVOID AND LIKE THIS STARTED JUST STARTED HAPPENING AND YOU UNNTIPIT IN THE BUT RIGHT SO I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THE DEFENCE MECHANISMS RIGHT THAT ARE GIRDING YOUR CONSCIOUS SELF AND I'D BE INTERESTED IN THE CHARCTER STRUCTURE WHAT DECISIONS ARE YOU THAN MAKING LIKE ARE YOU GOING ANYWAGHT RIGHT ARE YOU HAVING TROUBLE SO SOMETIMES YOU AVOID ARE YOU THEN MAKING DECISIONS THAT MAKE YOU LAID AND THAT CALLSIS PROBLEMS HOW DOES IT IMPACT YOU ONCE YOU'RE THERE ARE YOU ENGAGING DIFFERENTLY WITH PEOPLE DOING YOUR WORK DIFFERENTLY SO I WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE AND ULTIMATELY YOU UNDERSTAND ALL O THIS BY PROBING THE SELF THAT'S RIDING A LONG ON TOP OF IT AND THEN WHAT IS THE EXPERIENCE OF THAT SELF  DO YOU SEE THAT OKA THIS IS A PROBLEM AND I WANT O ADDRESS IT BUT I LOOK I KNOW THAT I'M GOOD WHAT I DO AND YOU KNOW MU THIS ISN'T SOME LIKE AWFUL THING ABOUT ME I JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT RIGHT OR IT IS YOURSELF IMPACTED WERE YOU STAR THINKING MAYBE I CAN'T DO THIS ANY MORE I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH OR YOU KNOW WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S THE EXPERIENCE OF THE SELF RIGHT AND IF WE DO ALL OF THAT HOW IS IT THAT WE DON'T GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT ANXIETY RIGHT AND WE CAN MAKE THINGS BETTER SO JUST LIKE IN PHYSICAL HEALTH OKING MAYBE WE CAN'T BUT THAT IS A DRAMATIC OUT LIR IF WE BRING OURSELVES TO BEAR WE WOULD SAY YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO HAVE THIS IN YOU RIGHT BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING NEGATIVE IT IS MAKING UNHAPPINESS FOR YOU IT IS TAKING AWAY FROM IMPOWERMENT RIGHT AND IT'S ALSO TAKING AWAY FROM HUMILITY RIGHT BECAUSE IF SOME ONE'S BEATING UP ON THEMSELVES YOU'RE BEATING UP ON YOURSELF ABOUT IT THAN THAT'S NOT HUMILITY RIGHT THAN THAT THAT'S BEING TOD FALSELY PERSECUTORY RIGHT THIS IT'S NOT AN HONEST HUMILITY TO THAT IT LEADS US AWAY FROM HEALTH SO SO WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE THIS WAY RIGHT BECAUSE THAT IS WORKING AGAINST AGENCY AND GRATITUDE SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND IT AND WE CAN GO AFTER IT AND MAKE IT BETTER ONE OF THE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS I GET ON THE INTERNATE AND I GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS IS WHAT CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE CONFIDENCE AND I'VE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THAT QUESTION AND IN WHAT IS CONFIDENCE IN THE CONTECTS OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW IS ONE REASONABLE DEFINITION OF CONFIDENCE OUR ABILITY TO TRUST OUR PREDISPOSITIONS AND OUR POTENTIALITIES ENOUGH THAT WERE WE TO ENCOUNTER SONARIO'S ATHRUGH S WE FEEL PRETTY GOOD THAT WE WOULD RESPOND THE RIGHT WAY IN A WAY THAT AM WOULDN'T THREATEN OUR CONSCIOUS MIND AT A CORE LEVEL RIGHT YOU KNOW THAT THER WE WOULDN'T AM I IUSED TO USE THE TERMINE AND CHOKE A LOT N MY LABORATORY A WITH THE THE PHRASE YOU KNOW DISSOLVE INTO A PUDDLE OF OUR OWN TEARS INE IS DOWN OF THI SLYING HYPEROBOLIC AN A EXPLANATION OF OF WHAT I THINK MANY PEOPLE FEAR LIKE THERE CAN BE CALLED UPON TO ANSWER A QUESTION PUBLICLY OR GIVE US BCORE THEIR GIN BEAT A CRITICAL MOMENT IN IN RAL THE RELATIONSHIP OR SOMETHING IN THE AND JUST EVERYTHING IS IS GOING GO SO BADLY WRONG THAT HITS JUST GOING TO DISSOLVE THEM AS A PERSON THIT'S IMPOSSIBLE RIGHT DISSOLVING ABUTTLE OR OF OUR OWN TEARS IS IMPOSSIBLE BUT I THINK THAT'S A FEAR THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVE WITH BECAUSE WE CAN GET INTO THE SOLOBIT LATER AND WE WILL I'M SURE I YOUKNOW THAT THIS NOTION OF LIKE PROTECTING ONE'S EGO IS I SEEMS REALLY VITAL TO T BEING A HUMAN BEING SOME ONE L LIKE WE DON'T WE DON'T WANT TO DISSOLVE INTO A PUDDLE OF OUR OWN TEARS SO IS CONFIDENCE THE ABILITY TO TRUST OURSELVES IN A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CONTECTS UM AND AT THE SAME TIME I I DO HAVE TO RAISE THE THIS NOTION OF NARCICISM I THINK A I YOU KNOW T THIS WORD GETS THROWN AROUND A LOT LATELY BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ANY AM TRULY PSYCHOLOGICALLY HEALTHY PERSON WOULD ALSO NOT WANT TO BE THE IDIOT THAT THINKS THAT THE'RE BETTER THAN THEY ACTUALLY ARE THAT'S IM WHAT RE YUR THOUGHTS ON THIS WELL I AGREE WITH THE THINGS THAT YOU THAT YOU SAID ABOUT CONFIDENCE EXCEPT I WOULD ADD TWO FACTORS THAT I THINK ARE THE REALLY BIG BIG FACTORS RI I ONE BEING STATE DEPENDENCE AND THE OTHER BEING PHENOMENOLOGY RIGHT SO THINK ABOUT THE STATE DEPENDENCE FIRST RIGHT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CONFIDENCE IT'S IT'S NOT UNIFORM RIGHT OR IT'S NOT AUTOMATICALLY UNIFORM RIGHT SO IF SO FEU WERE TO TELL ME ALOUGH I LACK CONFIDENCE RIGHT THEN I WAT I WANT TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT ACROSS THE BOARD IS LIKE IS THAT A WAY THAT YOU FEEL ABOUT YOURSELF THAT LIKE I I I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH AT ANYTHING FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT OR DO YOU LACK CONFIDENCE IN A SPECIFIC AREA IN THIS IS OFTEN THE CASE RIGT AND ITS IT'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE RIT IT SAYS THAT PERSON HAS THE MACHINERY OF CONFIDENCE SO TO SPEAK RIGHT THEY HAVE THE POTENTIALITIES IN THE PREDISPOSITIONS FOR CONFIDENCE RIGHT WHEN THAT CHARACTER STRUCTURE THIS SELF BUILT UPON IT ISN'T IN ENGAGING WITH THE WORLD RIGHT BUT HEY'RE NOT APLE TO BRING IT TO BEAR IN CERTAIN IN A CERTAIN SPECIAL SITUATION SO TO SPEAK SO FOR SOME PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE WAY WE MOST OFTEN SEE THIS IS LIKE THE CARVEOUT OF ROMANCE RIGHT WHERE BECAUSE IT'S SO EMOTIONALLY LATEN RIGHT AND LIKE REJECTION CAN FEEL SO BAD RIGHT THAT WE CAN SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY CONFIDENT IN MANY MANY ASPECTS OF LIFE BUT THEY ARE VERY DIFFIDENT ABOUT ROMANCE AND WE'LL SAY DIFFIDENT OH IT NEVER WORKS OUT FOR ME OR NO ONE WILL EVER LIKE ME RIGHT AND AND YOU SA THAT'S NOT HOW THAT PERSON ACTUALLY FEELS RIGHT ABOUT THEMSELVES IS A WHOLE HUMAN BEING RIGHT WHICH WHICH IT IS THEN WE ARE COMING AT HOW TO MAKE THAT BETTER IN A WAY THAT'S VERY ROBUST RIGHT WE MIGHT SAY SOMETHING LIKE HEY HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS IS YOU'VE THE TOOLS IN THE MACHINERY THAT YOU NEED RIGHT YOURE CONFIDENT IN SO MANY WAYS RIGHT IN FACT MAY BE IN OLD WAYS ACCEPT THIS ONE SO LET'S GO TAKE A LOOK AT LIKE WHY IS THAT SPECIAL RIHT AND THEN AND WHERE ARE WE WERE BACK TO IS IT SOMETHING IN THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS IT IF SOMETHING IN TH IN THE CONSCIOUS MIND BOW THAT PERSON IS ENGAGING RIGHT SO WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE STATE IS AND IF THE LACK OF CONFIDENCE IS STATE DEPENDENT IF THE PERSON IS NOT CONFIDENT ACROSS THE BOARD THAT AGAIN WE GO BACK TO THE SAME YOUL ALWAYS GO BACK TO THE SAME PLACES TO LOOK RIGHT BUT THN YOU MIGHT MORE THINK OKAT IT IS THERE AN IMPACT OF CHILDHOOD TROMA OR EARLY LIFE TROMA THAT THAT TOOK AWAY FROM THAT PERSON KNOW THAT THERE ABILITY TO TO GAIN CONFIDENCE RIGHT IN HIF YOUS HAVE NO CONFIDENCE ACROSS THE BOARD THERE'S A DEEPER PROBLEM RIGHT BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE H SOMETHING ANY ONE CAN BE GOOD ABOUT T AND FEEL CONFIDENT IN RIGHT SO THE STATE DEPENDENCE IS VERY IMPORTANT AS IS PHENOMENOLOGY SO WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE OF BEING CONFIDENT IF YOU TELL ME WELL I'M LET'S SAY IN A DIFFERENT VERSION OF THIS EXAMPLE YOU SAY YOU NOT ATYO I'M I'M QUITE I FEEL QUITE CONFIDENT WHEN I WHEN I WALK INTO A ROOM OF OF PEOPLE SAY OOKI I WANT UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT THAT TOO RIGHT BECAUSE IF I ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT AND YOU SAY WHY FEEL CONFIDENT BECAUSE LOOK M I'M A PRETTY SMART PERSON I CAN THINK ON MY FEET I CAN I CAN DEAL WELL WITH WITH PEOPLE IF SOMETHING DOESN'T GO RIGHT I CAN RECOVER FROM IT LIKE  I NO IT'S WHY I'VE FEEL CONFIDENT YOU KNOWS IT OKAT THAT SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD IF YOU SAY WELL I FEEL CONFIDENT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I'M BETTER THAN EVERYBODY RIGT NOW WE AVE A PROBLEM RIGHT RIGHT I THAT'S NOT GOING TO GO WELL IN OTHER YOU IN OTHER A ASPECTS OF LIFE AND ENGAGEMENT LIKE THIS YOUOW IT'S NOT GOING TO LEAD TO HUMILITY AND GRATITUDEI SO SO WHERE'S THAT COMING FROM AND AGAIN MAYBE THERE'S A DEEPER PROBLEM RAS YOU IS SO NARCISISA RIGHT WHICH CAN BE A A REACTION RY WHICH IS A REACTION TO VONERABILITY RIGHT SO THAND THERE'S WAS A REACTION FORMATION AND NOW THE PERSON IS ACTUN DEEPLY DIFFIDENT TO WRIGHT BUT PRESENTS AS VERY VERY CONFIDENT AND WITH A SENSE OF SUPERIORITY AND THAT DOES NOT A RECIPE FOR FOR HAPPINESS RIGHT SO SO IN THE IN APPROACHING IT WE WE DO WANT TO UNDERSTAND ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU SAID WORE ARE THE FACTORS AND THE THIS SET OF PREDISPOSITIONS AND THE SET OF POTENTIALITIES BUT THEN WHAT'S THE REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE OF THAT A CROSS SITUATIONS AND WHAT IS THE PERSONS EXPERIENCE OF THAT INSIDE WHICH IS WHY I FOREGON TO UNDERSTAND AND HELP PEOPLE LIKE THAT'S THE UNDERSTAND PART RIGHT YOU KNOW IT'S WHY THE CONVEY ABOUT MEDICON YOU KNOW THI IT DOESN'T WORK RIGHT IN SITUATIONS WERE DEALING WITH HUMAN BEINGS LIKE MENTAL HEALTH RIGHT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING ABOUT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHATEVER THEI'R TELLING US MEANS OTHERWISE YOU HAVE NO CONTEXT SO YOU HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE ANOTHER VERY COMMON SET OF QUESTIONS THAT I GET I BELIEVE IT'S VERY DIRECTLY RELATED TO THIS IS ABOUT BELIEFS AND INTERNAL NARRATIVES YOU DON'T PEOPLE ASK ME ALL THE TIME HOW CAN I CHANGE WHAT I BELIEVE ABOUT MYSELF AND THEY ALSO ASK HOW CAN I CHANGE THE SCRIPT IN MY HEAD HOW TO I TYPICALLY IT'S HOW DO I SHUT DOWN A PARTICULAR NARRATIVE IN MY HEAND IT SEEMS TO FIT VERY WELL IN THING ABOUT STRUCTURE OF SELF BECAUSE AS YOU POINTED OUT YOUA THE THE SELF WERE THE STRUCTURE OF SELF INCLUDES THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND YOU KNO WHAT'S GOING ON BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE WATER IN THIS ICEBERN MODEL WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CONSCIOUS MIND THAT THE CONSCIOUS MIND IS PROTECTED BY THESE DEFENSE MECHANISMS THAT GROW UP FROM THE UN CONSCIOUS MIND FROM THAT THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE AND THEN THE THNG THAT WE CALL THESELF RIGHT MIGHT BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BELIEFS AND INTERNAL NARRATIVES THOSE SEEM TO ME THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE PRETTY WELL AWARE OF IN FACT THE VERY EXAMPLE THAT PEOPLE ARE ASKING IN THIS ALL THE TIME I DON'T CHANGE BELIEFS INTERNAL NARRATIVES MEANS THEY ARE AWARE OF THEM IT ALSO SUGGESTS THAT FOR MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE THEIR BELIEFS ABOUT THEMSELVES AND THEIR INTERNAL NARRATIVES ARE NOT HEALTHY OR AT LEAST THEY DON'T FEEL ARE SERVING THEM WELL OR THAT THEY ARE INTRUSIVE I DON'T KNOW HOW OPEN PEOPLE ARE ABOUT THEIR BELIEFS AND INTERNAL NARRATIVES WHEN THEY COME TO YOU IN THE IN YOUR CLINICAL PRACTICE BUT AN I YOU COULD TELL AS ILE BIT ABOUT BELIEFS AND INTERNAL NARRATIVES AND WHETHER NOT THEY ARE IMPORTANT TO REWIRE IN AND AND RESET THIS PART IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT RIGHT SO IMAGINE FOR EXAMPLE THAT I'M SAYING TO MYSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT I'M A LOSER RIGHTER I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH RIGHT MAY IMAGINE TRYING TO GO THROUGH LIFE AND SOME ONE ELSE WERE SAYING THAT TO YOU ALL THE TIME I IMEATS WORSE ONE IS INSIDE YOUR OWN HEAD ISO WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF US OURE INTERNAL DIALOGUE ORE INTERNAL NARRATIVES ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND HERE'S WHERE WE RUN INTO A VERY BIG PROBLEM IS THAT WE LIVE IN AN ERA AND INICULTURE THAT IS VERY ATUNED TO RAPID GRATIFICATION IGHT AND ALL OF THIS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CAN CHANGE BUT IT DOES NOT CHANGE QUICKLY AND IT'S AMAZING TO ME WHEND AND YOU YOU'LL SEE UNDER INSURANCE PARADIMES OFTEN NO MATTER WHAT'S GOING ON WITH SOME ONE HAVE TEN SESSIONS OF COGNITIVE BEHAVIAL TREATMENT RIGHT IF THERE'S SOMETHING WE'RE TRYING TO CHANGE BELIEFS IT'S A GARANTEE OF FAILURE RIGHT BECAUSE BELIEFS DON'T CHANGE THAT FAST RIGHT SO IMAGINE FOR EXAMPLE THAT WE THE YOU AN I CHOSE A WORD RANDOM WORD AND WE DECIDED TO SAY IT FIVE HUNDRED TIMES RIGHT WE EACH BE SAYING IT TO NIGHT RIGHT ITS NOT GOIN TO BE OUT OF OUR MINDS BY TO NIGHT BUT BECAUSE WE WANT TOOK A RANDOM WORD AND SAID IT FIVE HUNDRED TIMES RIGHT SO IMAGINE HAT THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S HIGHLY EMOTIONALLY LADEN AND WE SAD IT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF TIMES RIGHT THIT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY QUICKLY RIGHT BUT IT CAN GO AWAY AND DURING THE PROCESS OF IT ATROPHEING RIGHT AOUR LIVES CAN GET BETTER RIGHT THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF HOPELESS RIGHT IT'S AT SHE VERY VERY ENCOURAGING BUT IN A WORLD IT'S RAPID GRATIFICATION RIGHTLY HOW WE FIX IS HOW WE FIX THIS NOW THAT DOESN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THIS WE HEAR ALL THE TIME THAT THA PERSON IS FAILED THERAPY RIGHT LY THIS IS SAID ALL THE TIME THAT PERSON FAILED IT WAS FAILED THER BE MEAN RIGHT I MEAN I THINK THERE BE FAILED THAT PERSON RIGHT BUT WE WE LABEL LIKE HOPE A PERSON ISN'T BETTER RIGHT BUT THERE' THINGS GOING ON INSIDE OF US THAT COULD TAKE MONTHS AND MONTHS OR YEARS TO MAKE BETTER TO GENT THAT'S O KAY IF WE'RE AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON JUST THE VERY FACT THAT WE UNDERSTAND AND WE'RE MAKING CHANGE RIGHT HELPS US FEEL BETTER ABOUT OURSELVES IND MORE CONFIDENT RIGHT THAT WE CAN CHANGE ALL THIS BUT WE HAVE TO APPROACH IT IN THE RIGHT WAY SO LET'S SAY THAT I'M TELLING MYSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN I'M YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THERE RIGHT IN LET'S A PLACE I WANT TO GO PROFESSIONALLY RIGHT OR NO ONE'S EVER GOIN REALLY WANT YOU RIGHT IF IF IT'S I'MLOOKING FOR ROMANTIC PARTNER RIGHT SO SO IMAGINE THESE THINGS A'RE GOING ON AND THEY'RE GOING ON OVER AND OVER AGAI YOU CAN IMAGINE NOW THIT'S IT'S INTRUDED INTO THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND IT'S GOING ON TO MY CONSCIOUS MIND MY DEFENSIVE STRUCTURE IS SHIFTING IN NEGATIVE WAYS AN B COMING MORE AVOIDIT LIKE NOTHING ABOUT THIS IS GOOD AND I WANTET TO CHANGE AND I WANTED TO CHANGE TO SOMETHING THAT SAYS EYOU CAN DO IT RIGHT OR YOU'RE LOVABLE RIGHT YOU CAN BE A GOOD PARTNER TO SOME ONE WHERESO I WANT TO CHANGE IT RIGHT SO IT IMAGINE NOW WHEN I START TO MAKE THAT CHANGE I'M BLAZING A PATH RIGHT AND AND I'M BLAZING A PATH WHERE THERE WASN'T A PATH BEFORE RIGHT AND I CAN BLAZE A PATH AND I CAN GO THROUGH THAT PATH BUT THAT PATH IS GOING TO BE NOTHING LIKE MAYBE THE FORELANE HIGHWAY RIGHT ADJACENT TO ME WHERE THE THING THAT I'VE BEEN TELLING MYSELF FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS BORN OF TRAMA RIGHT IS IS YOU KNOW IS GOING BACK AND FORTH RIGHT IT IT'S GOT A FORLANE HIGHWAY I'M CUTTING A PATH RIGHT BUT OVER TIME YOU CUT THAT PATH MORE AND MORE YOU TREAD THAT PATH MORE AND MORE YOU TAKE ENERGY TOWARDS THAT PATH IT BECOMES BETTER NOW LIT'S IMAGINE LIKE THE PATH IS WELL LIVED AND IT'S TWELVE FEET WIDE AND MAYE WE CAN PAVE THE PATH SO MORE MORE TRAFFIC SO TO SPEAK GOES DOWN IT AND WE'RE TAKING ENERGY AWAY FROM THAT FORELANE HIGHWAY AND MAYBE IT STARTS TO BE OVERGROWN A LITTLE BIT AND ER CRACKS IN THE ROW LIKE WE CAN CHANGE ALL OF THAT BUT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AND AND IDENTIFY IT LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON INSIDE OF ME WHAT DO I MAKE OF IT HOW DO I UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS OF CHANGE HOW DO I INCREASE MY IN POWERMET DURING THE PROCESS OF CHANGE IF WE COME AT IT THE RIGHT WAY ALL OF THIS CAN BE CHANGE IT'S NOT HARD WIRED IN US IT'S JUST VERY VERY STRONGLY REENFORCE TE SAY WHY OUR BRANS ARE BUILT THIS WAY SO WHAT WE DON'T FORGET OUR OWN NAMES RIGHT YOU KNOW WE DON'T FORGET WHERE WE LIVE YOU KNOW BACK WHEN WE ERE HUNTING AND GATHERING AND WE DON'T WE DN'T FORGET YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE THE GOOD FRUITS ALL REGHT AND ITS GOES ON IN HUMAN LIFE NOW IF WE'VE TO REMEMBER THINGS TIT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT IF SOMETHING IS HAS HIGH EMOTIONAL VEILANCE AND WE'VE THOUGHT IT A LOT THAT WE DON'T FORGET IT BUT THAT MECHANISM GETS HIGH JACKD BY THINGS THAT ARE NOT GOOD FOR US AND WE CAN TAKE IT BACK BUT NOT IF WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE TOOLS OR THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU GIVE OR ASK OF PATIENCE IN ORDER TO HELP THEM ALONG THAT PATHWAY IM BECAUSE I TOTALLY AGREE THAT CHANGING BELIEFS IN INTERNAL NARRATIVES IS VERY VERY HARD JUST ONE QUICK EXAMPLE THAT MESHES WITH THE PHYSICAL HEALTH RAL MIVA A FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE HE'S VERY COMPLISH SCIENTISTS WHO WAS VERY OVER WEIGHT FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME HE FINALLY MADE SOME BEHAVIOUR AL CHANGES THAT ALLOWED HIM TO LOSE I THINK IT WAS IN UPWARDS OF EIGHTY POUNDS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WE FELT MUCH BETTER LOOKED MUCH BETTER HE JUST DELIGHTED IN HIS ABILITY TO DO THAT BUT THEN STARTED TO REVEAL TO ME THAT HE WAS DEATHLY AFRAID THAT HE WAS GOING TO LOSE CONTROL AND START EATING THE WAY HE WAS BEFORE AND STOP EXERCISING IN A WAY THAT WOULD RETURN HIM TO HIS PREVIOUS WEIGHT AND FEELINGS OF MALAYS AND I SAID WELL ALL THE THINGS YOU'RE DOING ORE IN THE DIRECTION OF HEALTH NONE OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING SPEAKS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS ALL CRUMBLING THIS WAS THE DISSOLVE INTO A PUDDLE OF MY OWN TEARS KIND OF NARRATIVE BUT AT THIS POINT COMING FROM HIM AND HE JUST SAID I KNOW BUT DESPITE DOING ALL THE RIGHT THINGS I'M STILL INCREDIBLY AFRAID THAT IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IT WAS AS IF THAT THE BELIEFS AND THE INTERNAL NARRATIVES HADN'T CHANGED DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE WAS ENGAGING IN THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY AND WERE POSITIVELY I HAVEN'T CHECKED HIM WITH HIM RECENTLY TO FIND OUT WHERE HE'S AT WITH THIS NOW SEVERAL YEARS LATER HE HAS KEPT OFF MOST OF THE WEIGHT NOT ALL THAT E GAINED A LI IT BACK BUT HE STILL FAR HEALTHIER THAN THAN HE EVER WAS SO HOFLY IS  EXPERIENCE SOME RELIEF BUT YOU DON'T WHAT DO YOU TELL A PATIENT WHO ISAYING YOU I'VE GOT THIS LOOP IN MY HEAD THAT TELLS ME I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH OR THAT EVEN WHEN THINGS ARE GOING WELL THEY ARE GOING TO RETURN TO THAT STATE THAT I FEAR SO MUCH ONCE AGAIN THIS KIND OF LIKE YOU DON'T LACK OF AGENT CY RIGHT JUST LACK OF AGENCY LCK OF AGENCY LACK OF EMPOWERMENTS WHAT WHAT SORTS OF PRACTICAL TOOLS CAN CAN ONE GIVE A THEMSELVES AR THAT YOU WOULD PROVIDE TO SOMEBODY NO MATTER WHAT IS BEHIND WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT PERSON'S MIND IT'S ADDRESSABLE BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS AND HOW TO ADDRESS IT INTO WE ASK THE QUESTION OF WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE RIGHT SO IF HE'S AFRAID THAT HE'S GOTING GAIN ALL THAT WAI BACK RIGHT AND HE HAS A HISTORY THAT IF SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE THINGS HAPPEN HE THROW SELF CARE TO THE WIND RIGHT THAT THEN WE'D COME AT IT THROUGH THAT PATTERN RIGHT BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE A VERY OU N W HEOVE A GOOD REASON TO BE WORRIED RIGHT BECAUSE THIS PATTERN OF SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS AND I CAN'T OTOM TO CARE MYSELF FOR SIX MONTHS YOEN MAYBE SOME ONE I'M JISMAKING SUPPIN MAYBE SOMEONE IN HIS LIFE IS ILL OR HE'S FEARING A DEATH YOU KNOWN IF YOU CHOUSE SOMETHING THAT WOULD SAY THAT'S A VERY LEGITIMATE FEAR TO HAVE LEKE LET'S LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT LIKE LET'SLOOK AT WHERE THAT COMES FROM RIGHT WHAT GOT THAT PERSON INTO THAT PATTERN IN THE FIRST PLACE RIGHT BY UNDERSTANDING THE PATTERN AND BY WORKING TOGETHER RIGHT CAN WE CAN WE STAVE THAT OFF RIGHT BUT IT COULD BE DIFFERENT THE PERSON MIGHT SAY I'M MERLY I'M HAVING A LOT OF FOOD CRAVINGS RIGHT AND WE LIKE LOOK IT WHAT IS THAT MEAN WHERE'S THAT COMING FROM OR MAYBE HE'S DEPRESSED AND WHEN AND HE'S GETTING TO PRESS AND WHEN HE'S DEPRESSED HE CAN'T STOP EATING MORE RIGHT SO YOU KNOW YOU WOULD LOOK OR MIGHT JUST BE PLAIN OLD FEAR R LIKE THIS IS SO GOOD RIGHT THAT THAT I'M WORRIED IT WILL GO AWAY RIGHT THEN WE MIGHT WANT A REINFORCE I LOOK I LIKE YOU KNOW YOUR PERSON WHO'SE ABLE TO USE CIRCUMSPECTION AND PERSEVERANCE AND PRESERVE GOODNESS RIGHT SO LIKE YOU DO THAT YOU DO THAT REALLY WELL SO LET'S THUS MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING THAT HERE RIGHT SO YOUA LOT OF TIMES A PERSON IS WORRIED BUT THAT WORRY IS COMING THROUGH THE LENS OF HEALTH LIKE THEIR HEALTHY RIGHT SO THEN WE LOOK AT OOK A CAN WE SUTH THAT WAY WORE CAN' WERE'S THAT COMING FROM RIGHT WE CAN COME AT IT AND REENFORCE THE POSITIVE B UT IF THERE IS SOMETHING NEGATIVE THERE'S A TROME DRIVEN CSYCHLE THERE IS DEPRESSION IN THEIR CRAVINGS WHIC WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT TOO SO SO I COME BACK TO THIS IDEA THAT THERE'S ANSWERS TO JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING AND IN A VERY REGIMENTED SCIENTIFIC WAY IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO COME TO THEM RIGHT JUST LIKE IN PHYSICAL MEDICINE LIKE WE HAVE THE PRANT WE HAVE THE TOOLS THAT WE NEED TO BRING TO BEAR BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE PERSON AGAIND IF YOU COME IN AND SAY I'M NOT FEELING GOOD AND SOMEONE ELSE COMES IN AND SAYS I'M NOT FEELING GOOD THE DOCTOR BETTER NOT DO THE SAME THINGS R AS IS HOW ARE YOU NOT FEELING GOOD BUT LET ME UNDERSTAND THAT AND THEN THAT AUGT OME EMAP THAT ALSO TOO YOU WHATEVER UNDERLYING STATE OF HEALTH YOU MAY HAVE OR DIAGNOSEIS YOU MAY HAVE THE SAME IS TRUE AND MENTAL HEALTH IF WE JUST APPLY THAT THEN IT'S REMARKABLE THE GOOD THAT WE DO WHICH I'VE SEEM VERY CONSISTENTLY ACROSS TWENTY YEARS OF DOING THIS NOT ONLY IN MY OWN PRACTICE BUT  WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO DO REALLY REALLY WELL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE INCLUDING SOMETIMES NOT DOING TOO MUCH AND REALIZING LIKE AND THIS PERSON IS OKE LIKE THIS A STATE OF HEALTHIERE BUT THIS PERSON IS WORRIED HAW WE REASSURE THEM RAT HOW TO WE HELPE SOME ONE LIVING A GOOD LIFE LIVE A BETTER LIFE AD IF WE'RE GAN TO DO ALL OF THIS WE HAVE TO APPROACH PEOPLE AS INDIVIDUALS IS JUST IMEAN THE SCIENCE TELLS US THAT AND COMMON SENSE TELLS US THAT TOO BUT IF WE DO THAT A PERSON CAN GET TO THE PLACE THEY WANT TO BE ID LIKE TO ADDRESS A DIFFERENT PERSON AS AN EXAMPLE A HYPOTHETICAL PERSON AND I'M CERTAIN THERE ARE MANY MANY OF THESE PEOPLE OUT THERE THESE ARE THE SORTS OF PEOPLE THAT THINK OK THERE'S A SELF AND A MIND AN A UNCONSCIOUS MIND ET CETERA BUT YOU KNOW AT SOME LEVEL WHY NOT JUST DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN LIFE LIKE THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANT TO EXPLORE THE SELF YOU KNOW BECAUSE TO ME IT SEEMS SO ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT JUST AS ITS IMPORTANT HAVE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF ENDURANT STRENGTH FLEXIBILITY SO THAT ONE CAN EXTRACT THE MOST JOY AND AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AND EMPOWERMENT AND HUMILITY FROM LIFE THAT IT MAKE SENSE TO EXPLORE THE SELF TO ASK YOU KNOW WHERE AM I INTERNALLY STRONG WHERE AM I INTERNALLY WEAK YOU KNOW WHERE MIGHT I PERCEIVE MYSELF AS STRONGWARE AS I'M ACTUALLY WEAK IGH THEY SEEMS LIKE THES SEEM LIKE VERY IMPORTANT IF NOT CRUCIAL QUESTIONS TO ASK BUT I KNOW THAT THERE ARE CERAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THINK ALL THAT IS JUST KIND OF A WASTE OF TIME RIGHT IT'S ALL ABOUT DOING STUFF IT'IT'S ALL YO WY EXPLORE THE SELF YOU KNOW AND A I THINK THE REST OF US ARE LOOKING AT THAT PERSON OFTEN AND THINKING WELL YOU'RE EXACTLY THE KIND OF PERSON THAT NEEDS TO DO THIS BECAUSE OF THE WAYS THAT YOU GREAT ON OTHER PEOPLE BUT BUT NOT ALWAYS RIGHT SO NECY PEOPLE JUST APPEAR TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE THEY'RE ALL ABOUT THE OUTWARD EXPRESSION OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND I CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW HOW OTHER PEOPLE FEEL WAKING UP IN THE MORNING AND GOING TO SLEEP AT NIGHT AND THROUGHOUT THE DAY BUT TO THE PERSON THAT FEELS LIKE INTROSPECTION AND EXPLORING MAYBE VEN EXCAVATING FOR TRAMA THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN IN TOUCH WITH OR HAVE' DEALT WITH YET FOR THE PERSON THAT FEELS TAT ALL OF THAT IS  KIND OF NOT REALLY WORTH THE EFFORT AND THAT'S ALL ABOUT ACTION UWHAT CAN WE SAY TO THAT PERSON WERE THOSE PEOPLE PUT DIFFERENTLY DOES ONE NEED TO CHANGE AND NEED TO BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF THESE SORTS OF APPROACHES IN ORDER FOR THEM TO WORK WE OFTEN HEAR THAT PEOPLE DON'T CHANGE UNTIL THEY WANT TO CHANGE AND U AND COULD WE ALSO SAY PERHAPS THAT EVEN FOR PEOPLE THAT FEEL LIKE THEIR FUNCTIONING EXTREMELY WELL IN ALL DOMAINS OF LIFE I KNOW NO SUCH  PEOPLE AND I KNOW SOM VERY HIGH SHEAS AS YOU D I KNOW NO SUCH PEOPLE  THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO SEEM TO EXIST IN THAT SPHERE ARE THE NARSE THE CLEAR NARCISIS THAT TO THEM JUSTSEEM LIKE THEY'RE DOING GREAT BUT EVERY ONE ELSE CAN'T STAND THEM BY THE WAY NARSISIS NO ONE ELSE CAN STAND YOU A WHAT WHA WE SAY TO TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS CAUSE I THINK IT'S A BIG SWUATH OF HUMANITY AND I THINK IT A IT ACCOUNTS FOR A LOT OF SUFFERING IN THE WORLD INCLUDING THEIR OWN SUFFERING I WOULD MAKE AN APE EEL TO COMMON SENSE RIGHT SO IMAGINE YOU TAKE SOME ONE O DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HEALTH TTHEY DON'T NOW THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXERCISE NON HOW TO EAT WELL THT JUST DON'T KNOWL AN THEY'RE VER REALLY REALLY UNHEALTHY RIGTHEY'R OVER WAY THER THEYVE LOW ENERGY THE THEY'VE SLEEP APPENEA THEYDID NO NEED TO HAVE YOU AND AND AND WHY NOT JUST SAY TO THEM WELL I JUST GO BE DIFFERENT I CU EA FACT BE DIFFERENT NOW WHY ON'T YOU DIFFERENT RIGHT NOW RIGHT I OF COURSE WE WOULD NEVER DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S ABSURD AND BY THE WAY ALSO WOULD BE CRUEL RIGHT SOT'S ABSURD AND IT'S CRUESO WE WOULD NEVER DO THAT RIGHT LET'S SAY NOW YOU YOULET'S SAY WE FAST FORD SOME PERIOD OF MONTS EXS MAKE IT UPRIGHT AND WE SEE THAT PERSON AND WHILE THEY ARE MUCH HEALTHIER THEY'VE MUCH MORE ENERGY THEY'VE LOST WAY THER THEY'R PHYSICALLY FIT A LOT WILL HAVE GONE ON IN BETWEEN THOSE TWO SNAPSHOTS OF THAT PERSON THAT PERSON HAS TO LEARN THE LOT RIGHT HOW'S ONE TAKE CARE OF ONESELF RIHT THEN MORE SPECIFIC HO TO I TAKE CARE OF MYSELF RIGHT WHAT HEALTHY FOODS KNOW WELL I LIKE WIT EALTHY FOODS WELL I WELL I EAT HOW ILL I PUT THAT ON THE TABLE WHAT KIND OF EXERCISES CAN WORK FOR ME HOW WILL THY WORK FOR ME HOW DO I STRENGTH AN MUSCLE HOW O MI STRENGTHEN THE HARD HOW TO INCREASE LONG CAPACITY RIGHT THERE'S LEARNING THERE'S DILIGENCE IM YOU KNOW THER STICK TOITIVENESS RIGHT THERE'S RESILIENCE THAT'S HOW THE PERSON GETS THERE RIGHT IT  IT IS NO DIFFERENT EN IT'S MENTAL HEALTH RIGHT IF WE SAY WELL YOU YOU FEEL YOU FEEL DIFFIDENT ACROSS THE BOARD OR YOU FEEL SUPERIOR ACRSS THE BOARD OR WHATEVER IT IS LIKE LIFE ISN'T GOING WELL AND YOU DON'T AVE THINGS YOU WANT AND KNOW THE SELF TALK IS NEGATIVE AND WE S BUT WHAT JUST BE DIFFERENT RIGHT NOW RIGHT I MEAN IT'S REMARKABLE THAT PEOPLE WILL SAY THAT AT TIMES NOT JUST IN A WAY THAT'S DENEGRATING AND AWFUL FOR OTHERS BUT TO THEMSELVES TOO RITE ME I HEAR PEOPLE SAY THIS MOST OFTEN TO THEMSELVES LIKE I WHY AM I NOT JUST DIFFERENT RIGHT I I WANT TO BE DIFFERENT OR WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME THAT I'M NOT T THAND AND LIKE YE IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE LIKE YIV TO PLY UNDERSTANDING AND WORK AND EFFORT LIKE THE GOOD NEWS IS YOU CAN GET TO WHATEVER CHANGE YOU WANT TO MEAN A PRISON CAN GET TO WHATEVER REASONABLE CHANGE THAT PERSON WANTS I CAN IA'M FIFTY FOUR YEARS OLD I'M NOT ON TO CLIMB OUT EVERISE O'M NOT A MOUNTAIN CLIMBAT RIGHT BUT IF I WANT ED LIKE I WANT ORN TO CLIMBS THE MOUNTAINS I WOUND GET OUT THERE AND DO SOMETHINGS I CAN GO DO THAT RIGHT THE SAME THING IS TRUE WITH OUR MENTAL HEALFH GOLS BUT NOT AT THE SNAP OF A FINGER NOT BY MAGIC RIGHT IT'S THROUGH APPLYING THE SAME SCIENCE AND COMMON SENSE COMBINATION OF SCIENCE AND COMMON SENSE THAT WE APPLY TO OTHER THINGS THAT'S WHY WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCEDURE OF UNCONSCIOUS MIND CONSCIOUS MIND THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE SELF BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE THAT'S HOW THE AFTER SNAPS OUT LOOKS DIFFERENT THAN THAN BEFORE FUNDAMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVE AS WELF THAT'S VERY HELPFUL AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HELPFUL TO A LOT OF PEOPLE AN THINKING ABOUT WHAT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT SORTS OF QUESTIONS  TO ADDRESS MAYBE EVEN WHETHER OR NOT TO GET THERAPY AND HOPEFULLY WILL REMAP THEIR NOTIONS OF THARAPY I MEAN OF COURSE THIS CRITICALLY REALIES ON THE THERAPIST BEING GOOD TO EXCELLENT OM AND THINKING THE PREVIOUS AM SIT DOWN WE HAD ORON THE IN THE EPISODE ONTRAMA SPECIVICALLY YOU MAPPED OUT A NUMBER THE FEATURES OF QUALITY THARAPY SWE CAN REFER PEOPLE TO THAT A IF THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT IT'S TIME STAMPED IN THAT EPISODE OS SO YOU WHAT TO LOOK FOR AN ATHERAPIS WAT HOW TO ASSESS WHETHER NOT ITS GOING WELL OR NOT WHETHER NOT TO MOVE ON OR OR ERSTEY PUT WITH THAT THERAPISTS AND SO ON YOUE BEEN TELLING US A LOT ABOUT THE STRUCTURE AR OF THE SELF UN CONSCIOUS MIND CONSCIOUS MIND DEFENSE MECHANISMS CHARACTER STRUCTURE SELF WE HVEN'T TALK SO MUCH ABOUT THE FUNCTION OF SELF I REALIZE IT'S BEEN WOVEN IN HERE OR THERE YES A COULD YOU TELL US ABOUT THE FUNCTION OF SELF THE FUNCTIONS OF SELF VERB ACTIONS I MEAN OW THESE THINGS THAT O WE ARE ALL DOING RIGHT NOW THAT REFLECT OUR CHARACTER STRUCTURE ARE THESE THINGS THAT O WE CAN CHANGE MORE READILY THAN TRYING TO SNAP OUR FINGERS AND SA LOKA AM NOW GOING TO BE A MORE ALTURISTIC PERSON BECAUSE I CAN DECIDE THAT RIGHT NOW BUT THAN ULTIMATELY IAVE TO ENGAGE IN SOME ALTURISTIC BEHAVIORS THEYTO TO A MEN SUPPORT TO THAT AGAIN SAYING WITH THE PARALLEL THAT I CAN TO SNAP MY FINGERS AS A LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE YOU NOW HAVE TO DO SOME MEDITATIVE PRACTICE OF M CART YO MASK YOOA TRAINING AND THINGS O THAT SORT WHAT WHAT IS THIS FUNCTION OF SELF THING WHAT GOES INTO THE FUNCTIONS OF SELF SO SO JUST STEPPING BACK TO THE FRAMING RIGHT SO THERE THESE TWO PILLARS UPON WHICH WE BUILD OUR LIVES THE STRUCTURE OF SELF IN THE FUNCTION OF SELF AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING IS YOU SAID MORE ABOUT THE STRUCTURE WHICH IS MORE THAN NOUNS OF IT LIKE THERE IS AN UNCONSCIOUS WHAT IS IN THAT UNCONSCIOUS FOR EXAMPLE THATTHERE ARE DEFENSE MECHANISMS IHOW ARE WE USING THEM IT IS NOT ALL NUNS BUT IS MORE WHAT AR THOSE THINGS AND THEN WE START TALKING ABAUT HOW WE PUT THEM INTO PRACTICE THE FUNCTION OF SELF IS MUCH MORE THE VERBS RIGHTS OF THE STRUCTURE IS MORE NONS THE FUNCTION IS MORE THE VERBS WRIT THE ACTUAL ENGAGEMENT RIGHT SO SO THAT WOULD START WITH AN AN AWARENESS OF EY SO FUNCTION OF SELF HAS TO START WITH AN AWARENESS LIKE THEREIS A PERSON THERE ISN'T THERE IS A ME THAT IS SEPARATE FROM OTHERS AND I HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS I RIGHT LIKE IT IS ME NO ONE ELSE'S GUIDING IT LIKE IT'S ME I KNOW THERE'S A ME THEN ON TOP OF THAT WE START SEEING DEFENSE MECHANISMS IN ACTION RIGHTS FOR THINKING ABOUT FUNCTION RIGHT WERE AWARE THAT THEREIS AN EYE BUT THE FIRST THING THAT STARTS HAPPENING TO THAT I ARE UNCONSCIOUS THINGS RIGHT SO THE DEFENSE MECHANISMS BECAUSE WERE NOT CHOOSING THEM RIGHT THEY START DOING THINGS AUTOMATICALLY SO IF FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE A DEF ENSE OF AVOIDANCE RIGHT THEN I'M NOT THINKING YOU KNOW IF IT'S I'D LIKE TO MEET A NEW PERSON BUT I AUTOMATICALLY 'M SHYING AWAY RIGHT THEN THAT'S NOT IT'S NOT GOOD RIT'S A FACTOR RIGHT BUT IT'S A FACT TOR I' NOT AWARE OF INTIL I START THIS PROCESS OF INTERESPECTING RIGHT SO THE DEFENSE MECHANISMS ARE THEN KIND OF DETERMINING THE LAY OF THE LAND RIGHT SO IN THAT EXAMPLE A'M SARGE INTERRUPTED YET THE SARTIN ARUP BUT IN THAT EXAMPLE U'M THE THE RETURNING AWAY YOU DESCRIBE IS REFLECTIVE SO YOUR YOU TRING ABOUT SOMEONE PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A ROMANTIC PARTNER MEET SOMEBODY I'M HAVE A COMPANION AND THEY GO TO THE GROCERY STORE AND SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING AS THEIRE REACHING FOR THE MILK AND YOU KNOW THERE'S THAT MOMENT OF OPPORTUNITY WHERE THEY COULD SAY SOMETHING BACK WHET INSTEAD THEY JUST CONE  AT THANKS SON THE NIGHT THEY CONT RIGHT WAY AND THEN THE NARRATIVE IN THEIR HAD MIGHT BE I'L GASH THAT THOT IS THE SILIRBUT THEY DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT THE THE ALTERNATE POSSIBILITY BUTWHERE THERE MIGHT BE NO NARRATIVE AN THEN  THERE JIS NO HEAD OFF TO THEY OUT OFF TO THE PRODUCEECTION IN THEN THEY GO HOME AND AND SINCE IS OF ANYTHING HAPPENE THAT GOOD TO MEAN YOU ONE THE GROW  NOW RIGHT BECAS ALL UNCONSCIOUS RIGHT OOK T RIGHT NOW GE WE CAN CAN WE EXPLORE THAT AND CHANGE THAT YES RIGHT BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHATEVER THAT NEST OF DEFENSE MECHANISMS IS LIKE THAT'S WHAT I'VE GOT RIGHT NOW RIGHT AND I'M LIVING THROUGH THAT RIGHT NOW RIGHT THAT THIT'S IT'S PERFORMING A FUNCTION RIGHT JUST BECAUSE IT'S AN UNCONSCIOUS FUNCTION DOESN'T MEANI  SON A VERY VERY IMPORTANT FUNCTION I CAN SEE IN THAT EXAMPLE HOW IT PROTECTS THE CONSCIOUS MIND FROM RISK BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY OF REJECTION THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF OVER INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THE OTHER PERSON IS TALKING TO THEM FOR RIGHTLIG IS THE PERSON INTEREST IN THEM OR WHETHER NOT THIS IS JUST YOUNO FRET FRIENDLY BANTER U'M  THE SORT THAT ANY ONE WOULD HAVE NEXT TO ANYBODY THAT IS NOT SPECIAL TO THEM SO COUL SEE HOW THAT THE OF UNCONSCIOUS TURNING AWAY IS PROTECTIVE AGAINST ALL THE NEGATIVE POSSIBILITIES AND IN SOME SENSE IS PRERATIONAL BECAUSE THE THE PROBABILITY THAT THAT ONE INTERACTION COULD RATIT UP TO A  LIFE OF COMPANIONSHIP AND AND ROMANCE WITH SOMEBODY IS IS IN A EXCEEDINGLY SMALL REALLY ALTHOUGH YOU COULD IMIMAGINE A SAT A DATA POINTS WHERE YOU STRING TOGETHER YOUN LIKE FIVE SECOND CLIPSE YOU KNOW ALL LIKE THE TIME SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAS HAPPENED IT SO MAYBE THIS IS A PERSON THAT YOU INTERMITTINTLY LIKE PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN THEMERSING HEY OR SAYING HOLLO OR SHOWING INTERESTS YOU COULD STRING ALL THOSE TOGETHER AND THE PERSON HASN'T NOTICED ONE OF THEM RIGHT IN THEN COULD HAVE A VERY NEGATIVE SEE NOBODY NO ONE WANTS ME NO ONE'S INTERESTED IN MEOR WHATEVER THE PERSON IS SAYING BUT BUT TK IT'S DIFFERENT IF YOU SEE FROM THE OUTSIDE LI IT'S OBJECTIVELY DIFFERENT BUT THAT PERSON DOESN'T NOW AND THAT'S WHY AFTER BE AN AWARENESS THERE IS AN EYE THE NEXT THING THAT I THINK OF IN THE IN THE FUNCTION OFSELF IS IS THE DEFENSE MECHANISMS IN ACTION WHAT ARE SOME OTHER EXAMPLES OF DEFENSE MECHANISMS IN ACTION BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S IMMENSE INTEREST IN THUS AN YOUN THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE UNCONSCIOUS PROCESSIES IN US THAT ARE REACHING UP OUT OF THE ICEBERG AND PREVENTING US FROM SEEING OUR LIFE AND OURSELVES THE WAY THAT IT ACTUALLY IS OCCURRING AND PERHAPS PREVENTING US FROM ACHIEVING THESE A IDEALS OF AGENCY AND GRATITUDE EMPOWERMENT AND HUMILITY NO I MEAN YOU SEEM LIKE VERY POWERFUL AND IMPORTANT FORCES AND AND I AND I KNOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE OUT THEIR ONE UNDERSTAND WHETHER NOT WHAT WERE DOING IN WHAT WERE FEELING AND EXPERIENCING WHETHER NOT A THAT IS SERVING US WELL OR NOT SO I THINK THAT THAT THE PLACE TO START IS TO SAY THAT THERE'S SOMETHING VERY VERY COMPLICATED GOING ON ITHE THE PART OF THE ICEBERG UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE RITE THAT BIOLOGICAL SUPERCOMPUTER THAT'S RUNNING IT A MILLION THOUGHTS AND MILLION ACTIONS AND MILLION INTERNAL PROCESS OS A SECOND IT IS CONSTANTLY SHIFTING OUR DEFEN SIVE STRUCTURE SO SO IT'S COMPLICATED AND YOU CAN ALMOST IMAGINE THAT LIKE ONE LEAVES AND ANOTHER COMES IN N AND THERE SHIFTING AND THERES LITTLE BIT OF ONE AND SOME OF ANOTHER LIKE SO IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED PROCESS BUT WE CAN LOOK AT IT AND UNUNDERSTAND SO SO AN EXAMPLE OF A DEFENSE MECHANISM THAT'S VERY COMMON AND CAN CALLS US ALL LOT OF PROBLEMS IS PROJECTION RIGHT SO GIVE TO TWO EXAMPLES OF OF PROJECTION SO SO ONE IS THE EXPERIENCE OF SITTING IN A CAR RIGHT AND BEING STUCK IN TRAFFIC BEING A LITTLE BIT LAHT RIGHT AND FEELING BE LEAGURD RIGHT A MIN THIS AS HAPPENED TO ME MORE TIMES THAN I CAN COUNT BUT AT SOME POINT I STARTED THROUGH MY OWN FAIR BE LOOKING AT LIKEWUET WHAT'S GOING ON IN ME RIGHT WHEN WHEN I'M DOING THIS RIGHT SO THINK THAT THE BEFEELING BE LEAGURD RIGHT AS IF WHAT IS THAT MEAN LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED TRAFFIC THAT EXISTS AND HAS A MIND AND WANTS TO TWORT ME RIGHT IS IT INDIVIDUAL CARS TIS IT THE PEOPLE IN THE CARS RIGHT UTWHAT'S GOING ON IS OUT I'M HAVING A PERCEPTION OF HOSTILITY I FEEL BE LEAGUERD RIGHT BUGT IT'S IT'S ANGER AND FRUSTRATION IN SIDE OF ME RIGHT I'M I'M THE ONE FEELING ANGRY AND FRUSTRATED THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S NO ONE AND NOTHING BUT ME THAT'S FEELING ANYTHING ABOUT THIS RIGHT BUT I HAVE THE SENSE OF THE WORLD AROUND ME BEING HOSTILE BECAUSE I'M PROJECTING MY ANGER OUTWARD RIGHT NOW THINK THIS ISN'T GOOD BECAUSE INSTEAD OF SITTING IN TRAFFIC AND SAYING LOOK MAYBE IT TOTALLY MAKE SENSE THAT I'M STUCK IN TRAFFIC AND THAT THAT I'M NOT HAPPY IT MAYBE I SHOULD LEAVE A LITTLE BIT EARLIER AND I WOULDN'T BE LAIT OR IF IT'S GONE GOING TO WORK SHOULD I LIVE CLOSER TO WORK I CAN MAKE A WHOLE SET OF DECISIONS THAT I'M NOT MAKING RIGHT OR MAYBE I'D KNOW I THONGKS CAN BE A FIFTEEN MINUTE DRIVE AND LIKE THOS AN ACCIDENT RIGT AND  CANTHERE THINGS THAT I CAN'T CONTROL I MUST WAS TO CONTROL EVERYTHING RIGHT IFIF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT CAN I CONTROL BEING AWARE OF THAT AND WHAT CAN I NOT CONTROL RIGHT THEN IT CAN MAKE THE SITUATION MUCH BETTER SO THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN WITH THIS FREQUENCY AND IT ALSO TAKES AWAY THE ANGER AND THE FRUSTRATION RIGHT SO I THINK THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE BECAUSE IT IT HAPPENS A LOTS VERY VERY COMMON BUT PROJECTION THEN ALSO HAPPENS WITH PEOPLE RIGHT SO LET'S THAT YOU AND I WORK TOGETHER AND WEWERWWERE TO DO SOMETHING COLLABORATIVE TOGETHER AND I'MUS NOT HAVING A GOOD DAY AND SOMETHING NEGATIVE HAPPENED BEFORE I CAME TO WORK AND YOU KNOW I'M NOT AT MY BEST AND I'M A LITTLE BIT I'M A LITTLE BIT IRRITABLE AND FRUSTRATED RIGHT THITIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME WERE THEN THE PERSON SITS DOWN WITH SOME ONE AND THEN I'M BEING IRRITABLE AND FRUSTRATED WHICH DOESN'T FEEL GOOD TO YOU RIGHT AND AND YOU MAY BECOME IRRITABLE AND FRUSTRATED RIGHT AND THEN I SAY ALL LOOK EAS IRRITABLE AND FRUSTRATED RIGHT BUT EVEN IF YOU DON'T THE FACT THAT I FEEL THAT WAY RIGHT THAT PROJECTION OFTEN WOULD LEAD ME TI O THINK THAT IT'S YOU WHO'SE THAT WIGT HERE I COME WANTING TO DO THIS JOB AND YOU'RE NOT AT YOUR BEST IT'S ME WHO'S NOT AT MY BEST RIGHT BUT WE DO THIS ALL THE TIME AND THEN WE MAKE INCORRECT INACCURATE ACTRIBUTIONS RIGHT SO SO PROJECTION IS IT IS AN EXAMPLE OF A DEFENSE MECHANISM THAT CAN CAUSE US A LOT OF TROUBLE RIGHT A LOT OF TROUBLE  ANOTHER CAN BE DISPLACEMENT WER I IF I'M FEELING ANGER OR FRUSTRATION SAY IN A CERTAIN REALM THEN I THE IDEA OF FEELING IT AT WORK AND THEN KICKING THE DOG RIGHT IGHT TATIS NOT GOOD THAT WE DO THAT WERE NOT ACKNOWLEDGING WAS GOING ON INSIDE OF US AT WORK WHAT WE COULD CHANGE WHAT WE COULD MAKE BETTER AND THE DOG DOESN'T WANT TO BE KICKED RIGHT AND THE DOG IS OFTEN YOU KNOW ALSO THE FAMILY RIGTIN AND THAT COULD BE PHYSICALE OR COULD BE THROUGH WORDS RIGHT BUT THE IDEA THAT WITH THAT THERE'S SOMETHING NEGATIVE BEING GENERATED IN US BUT BUT INSIDE WERE WERE PERCEIVING THAT IT'S COMING FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE RIGHT I ME THE THOB BE IS ALL THINGS TO LEAD US ASTRAY RIGHT WHEN WHEN THEIR NEGATIVE DEFENSE IS RIGHT THERE CAN BE POSITIVE DEFENCES TOO SUCH AS ALTRUISM RIGHT THAT THAT SOME ONE COULD DO SOMETHING NEGATIVE TO ME R I AND INSTEAD OF ME PASSING THAT ALONG I COULD DESIDE NOWING GOING TO DO SOMETHING INLY SOMETHING NICE FOR THE NEXT PERSON I'VE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING NICE FOR RIGHT LIKE THAT'S A DEFENSE AND SOMETIMES WE COULD THINK OF IT IN DECIDE THAT WAY BUT THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO REACT THAT WAY LIKE THER SOMETHING NEGATIVE THAT HAPPENS AND THEY RESPOND WITH SOMETHING THATS IT'S DIFFERENT FROM THAT SO DEFENSE MECHANISMS CAN WORK AGAINST US THEY CAN WORK FOR US THER COMPLICATED EIR COMBINATIONS OF THEM BUT WE CAN LOOK INSIDE AND SAY FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M USING PROJECTION ALL THE TIME RIGHT AND I THINK EVERYONE AROUND ME IS KIND ALWAYS ANGRY AND FRUSTRATED RIGHT AND THERE'S ALWAYS BAD TRAFFIC RIGHT BUT THEN AS WE START TO TALK ABOUT IT MORE IT BECOMES A PARENT THAT THERE'S A LOT I'M ANGRY ABOUTRIGHT BUT I'M NOT AWARE OF IT THEN THEN REFLECTION OR THERI BE RIGT OR A GOOD FRIEND WE'RE TALKING TILL IT CAN HELP US SEE RIGHT THAT THIS IS GOING ON INSIDE OF ME RIGHT AND THAT CAN REALLY HELP US SAME WITH USE OF HUMOR LIKE IF I'M USING HUMOR AND I'M I'M GOT A DECOMPRESSING UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATIONS OR THINGS IT MAKE ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE MAYBE THAT GREASE IS THE WHEELS OF SOCIAL PROGRESS BUT MAYBE OVER TIME I COME TO OUSE HUMOR IN A WAY THAT'S SELF DENEGRATING RIGHT W THAT'S NOT SO GOOD ANY MORE BUT I MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THE SHIFT JUST AS I CAN MAYBE BE FUNNY IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS THAT I'M NOW NOT USING THAT FOR MYSELF ANY MORE AMUSING IT AGAINST MYSELF AND BY TALKING TO PEOPLE MY REFLECTION LIKE WE CAN BE AWARE OF THE DEFENSIVE STRUCTURE THAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF US AND THEN THERE'S NOT AN AUTUMNMATICITY TO IT IF YOU POINT OUT THAT I'M USING PROJECTION A LOT I CAN START TO BE AWARE OF THAT JUST LIKE IF SOME ONE THET'S SAY YOU WERE WITH ME AT THE GROCERY STORE RIGHT AND SOME ONE SAYS SOMETHING NICE AND I SHY WAY AND YOU SAY YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WERENT EVEN AWARE SOME ONE SAID HOLO TO YOU AND THEN I SUI THINK I WANT TO BE MORE AWARE OF THAT LIKE I WANT I DON'T WANT THAT THING TO HAPPEN UNCONSCIOUSLY SO MAYBE NOW I THINK OOK AT ANY TIME SOME ONE I DON'T KNOW SAYS SOMETHING NGN TOT STOP AND THINK LIK WHAT'S GOING ON HERE RIGHT IS THAT PERSON BEING FRIENDLY TO ME AS IT IS EY JUST KNOWS JUST PERSON EXCHANGING MANY THO CASHRAYS SO WHAT'S GOING ON SO WE TAKE WHAT'S UNCONSCIOUS AND WE MAKE IT CONSCIOUS SO THAT WE CAN CHANGE IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE EXPLORING AND THINKING ABOUT OUR REFLEXES IS WHAT'S REALLY KEY HERE IM EXAMPLE DISPLACEMENT THAT YOU GAVE YOU KICKING THE DOG I COULDN'T HELP BUT IM SMILE NOT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING TO DO I NEVER ONCE KICKED MY DOG BY THE WATFOLKS TERRIBLE THING TO DO ALSO HE WAS THE SIZE OF A BOLDER INJURED ANY MORE THAN WOULD HAVE INTURED HIM BUT I NEVER WOULD DO SUCH A THING HOWEVER IN ACADAMIA THERE'S THIS IM PHENOMENON IT'S VERY COMMON THAT THAT I REFER TO AS TRICKLE DOWN ANXIETY WHERE THE PERSON RUNNING THE LABORATORY IS INEVITABLY UNDER A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF STRASS GRANTS AND PAPERS ET CETERA AND GRADUATE STUDENTS AND POSTOCXS WILL IMMEDIATELY BE FAMILIAR WITH WHAT I'M DESCRIBING BUT IM FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVEN'T GONE TO GRADUATES COH UM THIS WOULL BE A A BIT FOREIGN BUT YOU'LL THINK OF OTHER EXAMPLES WHERE WHEN THE LABHEAD IS UNDER STRESS IT'S INCREDIABLY COMMON FOR LABHEADS TO WALK THROUGH THE LABORATORY AND START ASKING ABOUT EXPERIMENTS AND TELLING PEOPLE TO DO ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS AND BUSILY JUST A SIGNING BUSY WORK TO PEOPLE OR PRESSURING WHAT SIMPLY CANNOT BE MOVED ALONG ANY FASTER AND WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE TUDENT I WORKED FOR SOMEBODY WHO IS ETHE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THIS POENA TYPE WHEN I WAS A POSTDOC FRAND CLAY WOR RESON WHO AS A LITTLE BIT OF THAT PENATYPE AHEM ALTHOUGH I STILL LIKED WORKING FOR HIM VERY MUCH BUT I USED TO HAVE A RESPONSE THAT AT LEAST FOR ME WAS ADAPTIVE WHICH WAS I WOULD ALWAYS SAY I'M WORKING AS FAST AS I CAREFULLY CAN BECAUSE NO SCIENTIST EVER WANTS TO A SOMEBODY TO CUT CORNERS NO GOOD SCIENTISTS ANYWAY UM BUT TRICKLE DOWN ANXIETY IS COMMON IN EVERY OCCUPATION I THINK WE SEE THIS SORT OF DISPLACEMENT ALL THE TIME WHERE SOME ONE'S ANXIOUS AND SO THEY GO START CREATING ANXIETY FOR OTHER PEOPLE AN YOU COAN JUST AS YOUR DESCRIBING ON SEEING HOW PATHOLOGIC THAT IS FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED SO THAT THE ACADEMIC THE TRICKLE D OUT ANXIETY THAT YOU ARE JUST TALKING ABOUT IS IT'S A RELATED BUT BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT DEFENSE MECHANISM AND IT'S PROJECTIVE IDENTIFICATION RIGHT WHICH IS WHICH IS CAUSING OTHERS TO FEEL THE WAY THAT YOU FEEL IN ORDER TO GET YOUR NEEDS MAN RISIS A FORM OF PROJECTION AND ACTION PERHAPS YOU COULD ACLARIFY THE DEFINITION OF PROJECTION VERSES DISPLACEMENT VERSES PROJECTOV IDENTIFICATION YES SO PROJECTION IS WHEN YOU DON'T OWN IT SO SO IT'S NOT ME WHO'S MAD IT'S YOU RIGHT SO I DON'T OWN THAT I'M MAD AT ALL RIGHT I JUST THINK THAT IT'S YOU EVEN THOUGH I'M THE ONE WHO'S MAD RIGHT DISPLACEMEN IS WHAT COMES OUT OF US OR WHAT WHAT WERE OR ATTRIBUTION CAN SHIFT RIGHT IT'S IT'S NOT THIS PERSON IS MAKING ME ANGRY IT'S THAT PERSON CAUSE THAT'S A SAFER PERSON RIGHT O TO TO BE ANGRY AT RIGHT OR IF I'M THEN GOING TO TAKE OUT MY ANGER RIGHT INSTEAD OF METAPHORLLY KICKING E PERSON WHO MIGHT WHO MIHT RESPOND TO ME IN A WAY I DON'T WANT MAYBE I KICK THE DOG THAT'S HELPLESS TO RESPOND BACK RIGHT THAT'S DISPLACEMENT PROJECTIVE IDENTIFICATION IS THERE'S THERE'S AN EXPRESSION OF AN EMOTIONAL STATE INSIDE OF A PERSON THAT THEN BECOMES CONCAGIOUS TO OTHER PEOPLE EVEN THOU THE PERSON ISN'T TRYING TO DO THAT THE PERSONS AS UNGAN MAKE YOU ANXIOUS THAT'S NOT A DEFENCE MECHANISM ANY MORE RIGHT SO HE HEAR'S AN EXAMPLE I THINK I THINC IS THE BEST EXAMPLE OF PROJECTIVE IDENTIFICATION SO FOR LITTLE BIT OF TIME AT WORK I WOULD OCCASIONALLY LOSE MY KEYS RIGHT SO NOW I'M TRYING TO GO AND I CAN'T FIND MY KEYIS RIGHT SO IS OH I DON'T KNOW WHERE MY KEYS ARE RIGH SIM MT I SOGHT EXPRESSING SOMETHING RIGHT AND I'M ANXIOUS AND I'M TENTS RIGHT NOW PEOPLE AROUND ME HEAR THAT RIGHT AND WHAT ARE THEY START FEELING THIS ARE FEELING ANXIOUS AND TENSS THE WAY THAT I DO RIGHT AND NOW THERE LIK ONE NOTHER WANT ANOTHER ONE FIND MY KEYS RIGHT THEY WANT TO HELP ME SO THAT I STOPD SPREADING ANXIETY INTENTION INTO THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENT AROUND ME RIGHT SO THEN THEY HELP ME FIND MY KEYS I SAY THANK YOU MY OWN EMOTIONAL STATE COMES DOWN AND UPON REFLECTION I THINK LOOK I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT RIGHT I GOT MY I'M GETTING MY NEEDS MEN BY MAKING OTHER PEOPLE FEEL IN A WAY THAT'S LIKE NOT A GOOD OR COMFORTABLE WAY TO FEEL SO IT IS AWAY AROUND THAT LIKE PUT MY KEYS IN THE SAME PLACE EVERYDAY RIGHT SO THEN I CAN AVOID THAT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD TO ME LIKE THEN IF I GET OUT TO MY CAR LIKE I FIND YOU KNOW'M A LITTLE BUT OWN'T BREATHING A LTTLE HEAVY LIKE I DON'T DOESN'T FEEL GOOD I JUST AGITATED RIGHT AND I DID THAT TO OTHER PEOPLE TOO RIGHT SO IT IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW PROJECTIVE IDENTIFICATION WORKS AND HIS KINDEN SIMPLE EXAMPLE BUT IT CHOSE IT'S HAPPENING ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW ALL THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING ALL THE TIME BUT WE CAN BECOME AWARE OF IT AND I DON'T LOSE MY KEYS I DON'T HAVE TO FEEL BAD A BAD ONT TO ACTIV ATE MYSELF FOR NO REASON AND THEN ORN'T TO ACTIVATE OTHER PEOPLE FOR NO REASON SO SO THINKING AND REFLECTING LIKE CHANGE THAT THING FOR THE BETTER AND IT CAN DO WITH MUCH BIGGER THINGS TOO THANK YOU FOR THOSE CLARIFICATIONS I'D LIKE TO TOUCH ON HUMOR FOR A MOMENT OBVIOUSLY HUMOR IS A WONDERFUL THING OR CAN BE A WONDERFOL THING I'VE ALSO SEEN A LOT OF EXAMPLES OF WHERE VERY SMART AND ORE ACCOMPLISHED PEOPLE BECAUSE THOSE ARE NOT ALWAYS I A THE SAME THING USE SARCASM AS A FORM OF HUMOR AND IT CAN BE VERY FUNNY BUT I HAVE TO IMAGINE BASED ON EVERYTHING I'M HEARING FROM YOU TO DAY THAT I'M THERE'S A FORM OF SARCASM WHICH IS AN UNHEALTHY DEFENSE I'M THINKING OF THE PERSON THAT I'M NO MATTER WHAT SOME ONE ELSE SAYS THAT'S POSITIVE WOR OR NO MATTER WHAT SOME ONE DOES THAT COULD BE VIEWED AS POSITIVE THEY FIND SOME WAY TO DIMINISH IT BY I LIKE THROUGH SARCASTIC HUMOR I MIGH MIYT SEE THIS A LOT AND I THINK CLOSELY NESTED WITH SARCASM IS AM CYNICISM IM IN FACT I HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER I WON'T NAME WHO THEY ARE TO PROTECT THE NOT SO INNOCENT WHO USED TO BE VERY CYNICAL IM AND I ONCE ASK HIM WHAT IS THE THING ABOUT CYNICISM IN AND THEY SAID WELL I HAVE HAD A PARTICULAR A JANER OF OF SCHOOLING GROW ING UP A FORMAL SCHOOLING WHERE IF ANY ONE BEHAVED I'M TOO HAPPY EXPRESS TOO MUCH HAPPINESS RATHER TOO MUCH DELIGHT THEY WERE VIEWED AS STUPID LIK LIKE AS IF TO BE HAPPY IS TO U'M TO BE UNAWARE OF OF OF THE SOPHISTICATION AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THINGS IN LIFE RIGHT IM AND I HOPE THAT THIS IS UNRELATABLE TO MOST PEOPLE LISTENING BUT I'M I DO THINK THAT SARCASM IS IS A DOUBLEEDGE BLADE IM IN THIS SENSE AND THAT CYNICISM IS IS PERHAPS IM A DOUBLEEDGH BLADE AS WELL BUT THAT IT MIGHT EVEN BE WORSE THAN SARCASM BECAUSE IT'S A WAY OF REALLY A REFLECTING BACK WHAT'S BY DEFINITION WHAT'S NOT GOOD ABOUT LIFE WHAT'S NOT GOOD ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING AND AND IT DOES SEEM PROTECTIVE RIGHT IT PROTECTS ONE FROM DISAPPOINTMENT IF YOU'RE ALREADY DISAPPOINTED HOW COULD YOU BE FURTHER DISAPPOINTED IT'S ALSO SEEMS TO ME LIKE A BIT OF A POWER MOVE IT'S LIKE YOUREGINGTO BE HAPPY WHIL OMEN TO TAKE THAT AWAY FOR EVER FROM EVERYBODY LIKE A SOMETHING THAT'S LIKE FOR MYSELF IT IM DOES ANY OF THIS ACTUALLY HOLD IN THE INSIDE OF HUINAT CLINICAL LITERATURE IM BECAUSE AGAIN I ENJOY A GOOD SARCASTIC JOKE YET IN FACT THERE'S A COLLABORATION AROUND A SARCASTIC JOKE IT CAN BE TRULY FUNNY TO EVERYBODY BUT I'M SARCASM IN CYNICISM I'M I FELIC ARE OFTEN USED TO CUT DOWN WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE I'M BENEVOLENCE OR OR OR BONDING EXPERIENCES ABSOLUTELY I GREW UP IN CENTUAL NEW JERSEY HUMOR IS A WEAPON I OR IT CERTAINLY CAN BE AND PEOPLE CAN BE VERY AGGRESSIV THROUGH HUMOR SO SO ACTING OUT WHICH IS IIS LETTING OUR AGGRESSION FLOW IGHT THAT'S A DEFENSE IGHT SO TIS BEING AGGRESSIVE AND PUSHING SOME ONE BACK IHT HOWEVER THAT MEANS I IF I DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF I WANT YOU TO FEEL NOT SO GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF IG IS WHEY WE SARE GETTING INTO INTO ENVY AN HUMOR CAN BE USED THAT WAY SO SO THAT THAT'S A DEBITING SARCASTIC HUMOR IT IS A FORM OF ACTING OUT IT'S A FORM OF AGGRESSION RIGHT IT'S NOT HUMOR AS A HEALTHY DEFENSE OR I BEING CALLD THE SAME THING BUT WE COULD ALSO CALL IT DIFFERENT THING IS JUST A NEWANCE OF OUR LANGUAGE RIGHT IF IF IF HUMOR CAN BE A DEFENSE LIKE I I TRIP AND FALL I MAKE A LITTLE JOKE PEOPLE AR LAUGHING WITH ME INSTEAD OF AT ME RIGHT HEY HUMORS A GOD DEFENSE I MADE MYSELF FEEL BETTER MADE THINGS FLOAT FLOW MORE EASILY BUT IF I'M USING SARCASTIC HUMOR TO ASSALE SOME ONE RIGHT THEN THAT'S NOT IT'S NOT THAT THING ANY MORE RIGHT N KNOW NOW IT'S A MANIFESTATION OF AGGRESSION RIGHT AND THEY DEA THAT YNT CYNICISM YOU KNOW IT IS IS MORE THAN WITS TOK ABOUT A WORLD VIOU RIGHT LIKE SARCASM IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE NOW LIKE WE CAN MAKE A SARCASTIC JOKE FUNNY OR NOT THAN IT'S OVER RIGHT A BUT CYNICISM IS IS A WAY OF COMING AT THE WORLD IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF DEFENSE RIGHT THE IDEA THAT HEYI'S LIKE THATHE FOX IN THE SOUR GRAPES LIKE I DON'T  I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING GOOD TO BE HAD ANYWAY RIGHT SO YOU CAN'T TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM ME CAN'T MAKE ME FEEL WORSE RIGHT II ALREADY FEEL A VERY VERY BAD ABOUT THE WORLD AND ABOUT EVERYBODY IN IT AND I'M PROTECTING MYSELF THAT WAY LIKE THAT'S THEN AN UNHEALTHY DEFENSE AS WHAT OES THAT LEAD TO AT LEAST TO ISOLATION AT LEAST TO MISTRUST YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT  PEOPLE ARE HAPPY IF THEY LIVE THROUGH ALTERUISM AND GRATITUDE AND THEIR WELL CONNECTED WITH OTHERS SO SO THE CYNICAL POINT OF VIEW WHICH CAN' TO SOME DEGREE BEING IN THE WORLD BUILDS SOME CYNICISM IN US RIGHT LIKE THAT THAT'S O KAY THAT'S PART OF THAT'S A A PART OF A WARENESS IN SOME SENSE BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'R TALKING ABOUT IS A VERY PERVASIVE CYNICISM THAT THAN IS AN UNHEALTHY DEFENSE THAT IS VERY HARMFUL TO OTHERS THE  THE IDEA THAT I FEEL BLOUSY ABOUT EVERYTHING AND IF YOU DON'T I'N GOING TO TRY AND BRING YOU DOWN RIGHT LIKE TOO MUCH HAPPINESS WE'LL LABEL THAT AS SOMETHING RIGHT LABEL IT IS STUPID RIGHT SO NOUS LIKE IT'S NOT OKE TO BE HAPPIER THAND SOME SOT OF CYNICAL BASE LINE RIGHT AND AND THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT ALTERISM IN GRATITULEE THAT'S NOT HAPPY RIGHT I MEAN WHO'S HAPPY IN THAT SITUATION CNIC THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OVERLY CYNICAL OR NOT HAPPY AND PEOPLE AROUND THEM ARE NOT HAPPY NOBODY'S HAPPY THANKS FOR THE CLARIFICATION ON NEW JERSEY A GOOD PORTION OF MY BIOLOGICAL FAMILIES FROM NEW JERSEY ABNOUT WELL ARMED I ID ADORE THEM BUT IT'S TRUE THERE WAS ONCE A MOMENT AT A FAMILY GATHERING WHERE SOMEBODY SAID A LET'S UM LET'S HUG OR SOMETHING AND THE REACTION WAS LIKE OH ER GONNA HUG NOW YES S WAS ITAS IT WAS ENTIRELY SARCASTIC AND CINEGAL AND LIGHT IN THE THAT THE HUG THAT RESULTED FROM THAT WAS THIS LIKE LO LIE LIKE THIS THEONOTHING YOU AS AND NOW I'M LAUGHING ABOUT AND IT'S FUNNY AN AND THER VERY LOVING PEOPLE BUT YOUR RIGHT IT'S A IT'S A A DIFFERENT STYLE OF HUMOR AND DISCOURSE SO BEEN TALKING BY THESE TWO PILLARS OF THE SELF AND WHO WE ARE AND HOW THINGS PLAY OUT IN THE WORLD FOR US AS THE STRUCTURE OF SELF AND THE FUNCTION OF SELF AND IT TRS THE FUNCTION OF SELF YOU DESCRIBED SELF AWARENESS THIS NOTION AR THIS REALIZATION THAT THERE IS AN EYE THERE'S A ME AND THEN WE BEENTAING ABOUT DEFENSE MECHANISMS INACTION HOW THESE PLAY OUT IN  THE REAL WORLD BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A LOT OF WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING THE FUNCTION OF SELF HAS TO DO WITH THE WHAT WE PAY ATTENTION TO A WHERE WE PLACE ORE OUR EFFORTS OR CHOOSE TO NOT PLACE OUR ATTENTION AND NOT PLACE OUR EFFORTS DO'IT HAVE THAT RIGHT RIGHT YET THE SALIENCE IS IT IS A HUGE CONCEPT IN I ETHINGIN IN HUMAN EXISTENCE IMEAN THEIRE THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF THINGS THAT THAT YOU OR I COULD BE PAYING ATTENTION TO RIGHT NOW BUT BUT WERE WE'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO ANYTHING EXCEPT WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT HERES SO WE ARE GAITING OUT SO MANY OTHER THOUGHTS IDEAS NARRATIVES INSIDE NOW SOMETHING WERE TO SHIFT VERY QUICKLY IF WE HEARD A LOUD NOISE RIGHT OUR ATTENTION WOULD SHIFT T RIGHT SO SO OUR ATTENTION IS IT'S FOCUS WERE SALIENT TO ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT WE'VE CHOSEN WERE FOCUSSING OUR MINDS AND WE ARE ALSO SOMEWHERE INSIDE OF US AWARE THAT WE COULD SHIFT AWAY FROM IT IF SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT LIKE SOMETHING DANGEROUS  WERE TO HAPPEN  SO IT LETS US BE HERE AND BE SAILING IT TO ONE ANOTHER AND HAVE THIS CONVERSATION I BUT IN THE COURSE OF LIFE WHAT SALIENT TO US IS SO COMPLICATED AND DETERMINED BY SO MANY FACTORS THAT IS ABSOLUTELY WORTH A LOT OF ATTENTION TO SO SO ONE EXAMPLE IS SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE A NEGATIVE INTERNAL DIALOGUE THAT'S RUNNING IN THEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN OR THER RUNNING THROUGH IMAGES EVENTS OR THEY MAY BE TRAMATIC EVENTS OR THINGS THAT THEY'RE NOT HAPPY WITH IMAGES OF THEMSELVES IN NEGATIVE WAYS AM THAT THAT THESE INTERNAL NARRATIVES OR INTERNAL IMAGES CAN BECOME SO STRONG THAT THERE'S NO ROOM FOR ANYTHING ELSE SO O AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE A A PERSON WHO IWHO REALLY REALLY LOVED MUSIC I AND COULD HAVE YOU KNOW JUST IN ADDITION TO ENJOYING MUSIC LIKE HAD A GOOD THOUGHTS WHILE LISTENING TO MUSIC LOOK YOU KNOW AT I COULD GO DO THIS RIGHT AND AND AND AT A HISTORY OF  LIKE THAT REALLY WORKING OUT WELL LIKE FOLLOWING IS INTERESTS AND AND TIKE REALLY CREATING SOT OF GOODNESS IN HIS LIFE I WHO NOW WAS GOING FOR LONG DRIVES LIKE LONGER THAN WOULD BE NEEDED TO GO SOMEWHERE GET SOMETHING LIKE WHY THE EXTRA TIME IN THE CAR AND I HAD HAD A PRESUMPTION OF ET PERSONS LESTENING TO MUSIC AND THINKING BUT BUT IT ISN'T QUITE AD UP AND THEN I LEARN THAT THE PERSON IS NOT LISTENING TO MUSIC I THAT THEY'RE USING THAT TIME SO THAT THE INTERNAL NARRATIVE I WHICH WAS A VERY VERY NEGATIVE REPEATED INTERNAL NEGIT YOU'RE NOT GING TO GET ANYWHERE I COULD MAKE ANYTHING OF IT OF YOURSELF I COULD BE THERE IN HIS MIND SI WAS A FORM OF SELF PUNISHMENT I WAS A FORM OF OF TAKING THE ANGER AND FRUSTRATION INSIDE AND ENACTING IT TOWARDS HIMSELF AND THAT WAS SO SALIENT THAT THIS PERSON COULD NOT SEE HIS WAY TO ANY GOODNESS LIKE NOTHING COULD CHANGE NOTHING COULD GET ANY BETTER FELT VERY SURE AND VERY RESOLVED ABOUT THAT AND THE ANSWER WAS YE THAT'S RIGHT T BAY NOTHING CAN GET ANY BETTER WITH THIS CONSTANT MONTRA RUNNING OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT THINGS CAN GET BETTER IGHT IF THAT BECOMES LESS SALIENT OVER TIME AND YOUR OWN THOUGHTS AND REFLECTIONS BECOME MORE SALIENT SO AT THE OTHER END OF THAT SHIFT YOU KNOW THAT NARRATIVE THAT WAS STILL THERE BUT IT WAS WEAKENED RIGHT BECAUSE IT TAKES TIME TO REALLY CHANGE THINGS WHO WAS VERY MUCH WEAKENED THE PERSON WAS LISTENING TO MUSIC AGAIN THOSE THOUGHTS HAD KAD A COME BACK TO THE SURFACE AND THEY WERE BEING SO TO JUMBLED YOU KNOW IN WAYS THAT THAT BROUGHT NEW AND INTERESTING THOUGHTS COMING FROM THEM AND THE PERSON WAS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PLACE IND LIKE COMPLETELY CHANGE THEIR LIFE I I MEAN THIS IS IT THIS IS TRUE RIGHT IS A DRAMATIC EXAMPLE BUT DRAMATIC EXAMPLES INFORM US I WHERE THE SALIENTS SHIFTED AND THEN THE LIFE SHIFTED AFTER THAT WHAT YOU'R DESCRIBING IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC EXAMPLE I'M DOESN'T RESINATE WITH ME IN TERMS OF MY OWN EXPERIENCE ALTHOUGH IT AS YOU POINT OUT IT'S VERY STRIKING IT'S VERY DRAMATIC I'M BUT IT RESINATES WITH ME FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE I'M I'M NOT SEEKING A FREE CLINICAL SESSION HERE BUT AH BUT TO GIVE MEAT TO THE EXAMPLE I'M ABOUT TO ASK YOU FOR INSIDT ON I'VE NEVER ALLOWED MYSELF TO STAY IN A BAD PROFESSIONAL SITUATION FOR VERY LONG NOW WHEN THINGS DIDN'T FEEL WRIGHTER WHEN I SENS SOME ONE I WAS WORKING WITH OR FOR WASN'T THE RIGHT SITUATION I GOT OUT DESPITE IF I WERE TO REALLY THINK ABOUT IT THAT COUD HAV BEEN PRETTY SEVERE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES FORTUNATELY IT ALL WORKED OUT IN FACT SO MUCH SO THAT I WOULD SAY I YOU KNOW I PAY ATTENTION TO WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE I WORK WITH AND FOUR ARE OF THE SORT THAT I WANT TO BE WORKING WITH AND IF I SENSE A PARTICULAR TYPE OF DANGER I'LL LOOK AT THAT AND I I'M A HUNDRED PER CENT SO FAR NI NOT ON WOOD BUT A HUNDRED PER CENT SO FAR ON RECOGNIZING LATER THAT IT WAS A GREAT DECISION TO MOVE ON AND ON THE FLIP SIDE OF IT I'VE MADE I BELIEVE EXCELLENT DECISIONS AND TERMS OF WHO TO WORK WITH IN TERMS OF MY PODCASTING IN TERMS OF MY ACADEMIC CAREER ET CETERA BUT I'VE HAD TO MOVE AWAY FROM PEOPLE THAT JUST WEREN'T RIGHT FOR ME DON'T THNK THEY WERE TRULY BAD ACTORS BUT THANK GOODNESS I MOVED AWAY AND THANK GOODNESS I FOUND THESE OTHER WONDERFUL PEOPLE TO WORK WITH HOWEVER THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAVE BEEN REPETATIVE IN MY LIFE WHERE I'VE JUST BE HONEST REPEATEDLY MADE NOT GOOD DECISIONS ABOUT WHO TO BE INVOLVED WITH OVER FAIRLY LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND THERE CAN EVEN BE AN AWARENESS I SHOULD SAY THERE HAS BEEN IN AWARENESS LIKE THIS ISN'T A GOOD SITUATION AND YET I'M PERSISTING IN IN SEEKING OUT THIS IN SIMILAR TYPES OF SITUATIONS SO I CONSIDER MYSELF A THE LEAST PARTIALLY RATIONAL HUMN BEING WITH SOME DEGREE OF INTROSPECTION YOU KNOW WHEN I LOOK AT THIS AND I THINK COCATE THIS IS A CHOICE TO FOCUS ON PLACING MYSELF IN I HAVE TO ASSUME IT PLACING MYSELF IN TO SITUATIONS THAT ARE CHALLENGING FROM ME IN A WAY THAT I KNOW IS PREVENTING ME FROM LIVING IN CERTAIN WAYS THAT I WANT AND FROM BEING COHAPPY IN CERTAIN WAYS THAT I WANT WHEN YOU HEAR A CENARIO LIKE THAT LIKE I CAN DO IT OVER HERE BUT I CAN'T SEEM TO DO IT OVER HERE IN FACT I SEE MYSELF DOING AT THE WRONG WAY HERE RIT A LOO IT DIFFERENT THAN THE EXAMPLE YOU GAVE A MOMENT AGO BECAUSE I WAS DRIVING A WORK NOT LISTENING TO MUSIC BUT IT WASN'T PUTTING TWO AND TWO TOGETHER ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON BUT WHEN SOMEBODY CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON I THNK THIS MIGHT EVEN BE CALLED THE REPETITION COMPULSION OR SOMETIMES YET WHAT IS THAT ABOUT ARE  PEOPLE TRYING TO WORK OUT SOMETHING SPECIFIC ER ARE THEY DELIBERATELY CREATING SOME FRICTION TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING ELSE IT I MEAN I REALIZE THIS COL BE INFINITELY COMPLEX AND AGAIN I'M NOT TRYING TO EXTRACT THEM I THE CLINICAL INS I FOR FOR MY OWN SAKE I START ANONCLOCK ON THAT THANK YOU U BUT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DO THIS THAT THEY DO WHAT THEY KNOW THEY SHOULDN'T BE DOING THEY KNOW THEY SHOULDN'T BE DOING IT DAH I JUST SAID THAT TWO WAYS AND BUT THEY DO IT LIKE IT MUST SERVE THEM IN SOME WAY YOU KNOW YOU THINK ABOUT UM WHEN YOU GET A DOG IN YOUR TOCTOR DOG TRAINER THEY SAY YOU KNOW A DOGS DO WHAT WORKS RIGHT THEY GET AREWARD FOR DOMS ON THER IS CONTINUED DOING IT U YOU APPLY THAT TO THE SAME SORT OF THING I'M DESCRIBING FOR MYSELF AND THAT I'VE OBSERVED ANOTHER PEOPLE YOU MUST SAY IT MUST WORK FOR THEM YOU EAR THUSN'T COUNT OF POP PSYCHOLOGY IT MUST WORK FOR THEM OR YOU MUST BE SOLVING SOMETHING WHY THE HEW DO I DO THIS WHY DO PEOPLE DO THIS IS IT REAL PATHOLOGY OR IS IT A ROUNDABOUT WAY TO GET TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S ACTUALLY O PRETTY ADAPTIVE INSTEAD OF DEFINING THIS PATHOLOGY WOULD NOT TO FIND AT IS PYTHOLOGY I WOULD TOFIND IT AS HUMANNESS IF HUMANNESS IS NOT IN AN OF ITSELF PATHOLOGICAL THEN ALL YOU'R DOING THERE IS IS DESCRIBING SOMETHING THAT IS COMMON WIDESPREAD A CROSS HUMAN BEINGS NOT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT AND MAKE IT HEALTHIER RIGHT I WORK IN A DISCIPLINE THAT WANTS TO PUT A NUMBER ON EVERYTHING RIGHT LABEL IT AS SOMETHING AN THEN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT'S MORE OFTEN THAN NOT INEFFECTIVE RIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THINGS IN A TOP DOWN WAY OF WHAT IS HUMAN EXPERIENCE WHAT ARE THE NATURAL ASPECTS OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE THAT ARE LESS THAN IDEAL RIGHT THAT WE CAN THEN UNDERSTAND AND MAKE BETTER IF WE COME AT IT THAT WAY THEN WE SEE AH ITIS A GREAT EXAMPLE BECAUSE HERE'S WHERE STRUCTURE MEETS FUNCTION RIGHT SO ON THE STRUCTURE SIDE WE SIAY THEREIS DEFENSE MECHANISMS AND WE IMAGINE THE BRANCH IT IS RIGHT THAT THAT COMING UP FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND IGHT AND HERE IT MEETS FUNCTION RIGHT DEFENSE MECHANISMS INACTION ON THE FUNCTION SIDE THEN DETERMINING SAILIENCE SO WHAT I WOULD IMAGINE IN YO OUR EXAMPLE MY IMAGE IS THAT YOU'RE DEFENSIVE STRUCTURE WHAND YOU'RE DOING THE THING THAT'S EFFECTIVE RIGHT THE PROFESSIONAL DECISIONS RIGHT LOOKS ELEGANT RIGHT LIK THAT THAT THERE'S HARMONY TO WHERE THOSE BRANCHES ARE THE CONSCIOUSNESS IS SITTING IN BETWEEN IT YOU CAN SEE YOU CAN SEE THE ELEGANCE TO IT RIGHT THAT I CAN JUST IMAGINE SHIFTING RIGHT WHEN WHEN YOU'RE NOT DOING THE THING EFFECTIVELY RIGHT BECAUSE NOW YOUR USING AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT DEFENSIVE STRUCTURE WHICH IS GAN AFFUNCTION DIFFERENTLY AND CREATE DIFFERENT SALIENCE AND I IMAGINE THAT IT'S CONVOLUDED AND YOU KNOW THAT IT SORT OF PIECE MEO THAT IT'S NOT SOMETHING ELEGANT RIGHT SO YOU SAI WHATD IS IT ACTUALLY MEAN LET'S TRANSLATED INTO WHAT ARE THE ACTUAL DEFENCES SO WOULD THING BOUT WHAT YOU'RE NOT DOING WHEN YOU'RE MAKING GOOD DECISIONS IN THE PROFESSIONAL ROUL RIGHT YOU ARE NOT USING DENIAL OR AVOIDANCE OR RATIONALIZATION OR PROJECTION OR PROJECTIVE IDENTIFICATION OR ACTING OUT RIGHT THEY'RE ALL THESE THINGS THAT YOU ARE NOT DOING THAT ARE THE SORT OF UNHEALTHY DEFENCE IS BECKONING TO US LICLEWOULDN'T IT BE EASIER TO KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD RIGHT YOU KNOW WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER TO JUST ICKNOW IN EVERYTHING SOEVERYTHING CAN WORK OUT O KIGHT WOULD'T IT BE EASIER INSTEAD OF BEING ANGRY AT ONE PERSON WHO IS REALLY INTRINSIC TO THE ENVIRONMENT IF YOU YOU KNOWIS ACTALY SOMEBODY ELSEED OR YOU DISPLACING PROJECTING T THAT'S HOW PEOPLE THATS WE GET OURSELVES INTO TROUBLE RIGHT AND IF THAT'S GOING ON THAN THAT SET OF DEFENSE MECHANISMS IN ACTION RIGHT CROKET CREATES SOMETHING THAT OBSCURES THE ABILITY TO MAKE GOOD JUDGMENT RIGHT BUT WITH NONE OF THOSE THINGS GOING ON THAN WOULD YOU DOING WHAT YOU'RE APPLYING YOUR INTELLIGENCE YOU'RE APPLYING YOUR DISCERNMENT RIGHT YOU'RE APPLYING YOUR DESIRE TO MAKE THINGS BETTER YOU'RE ABLE TO LOOK AT IT YOU'RE ABLE TO BRING DILIGENCE PERSEVERANCE RIGHT YOU'RE ABLE TO BRING HEALTHY ASPECTS OF SELF TO THE QUESTION AND TISI LIKE OH I DON'T WANT THIS IN IT SHOULD BE DIFFERENT RIGHT AND THERE AGAIN WHAT'S GOING ON THERE'S A COMPLEXITY UNDER THE SURFACE BUT NOW WE'RE COMING UP TOWARDS SIMPLICITY RIGHT WE'RE COMING UP TOWARDS E THINSTHAT ARE HEALTHIER THAT ARE SIMPLICITIC IF WE LOOK THEN O A WHAT'S GOING ON IF YOU'RE MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHAT WICKED YO WE WOULD DIVE UNDER THE HOOD AND REALLY LOOK AND TOOK A WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE BUT IT HAS TO BE AN ARRAY OF UNHEALTHY DEFENCES NO OTHER THING IT COULD BE SO WED SA OKE ARE YOU USING ARE USING AVOIDANCE MAYBE A LITTLE MAYBE ALOT WHAT ABOUT DENIAL WHAT ABOUT RATIONALISATION AND WHAT ABOUT PROJECTION IYOU KNOW YE GO THROUGH THE UNHEALTHY DEFENCES AND AND YOU SEE WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE BRINGING TO BEAR THAT IS LEADING YOU ASTRAY AND THEN THEN OF COURSE THE GOAL IS TO USE TH THE ROL MODELLING AND YOU ROL MODEL FOR YOURSELF HOW TO BE HEALTHY RIGHT SO LET'S TAKE THAT RO MODELLING AND APPLY IT TO THE THING YOU SHOOD A CARVING OUT AND ENTREATING DIFFERENTLY AND AND THAT'S TA REASON WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT REPETITION COMPULSIONS YOU KNOW THAT'S IT'S NOT A FORMAL TERM BECAUSE BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HIS REPETITION RIGHT WE'RE INTERESTED LIKE WHAT WHY DO WE REPEAT THINGS NOW THAT'S ONE THAT'S ONE REASON RIGHT BECAUSE WE BRING AN UNHEALTHY SET OF DEFENCES AND THEN AT THE END OF THE DAY THINGS COME OUT THE SAME BECAUSE WE'RE BRINGING AN UNHEALTHY SET OF DEFENCES RIGHT THERE CAN BE OTHER MOTIVATIONS THAT ARE RELATED TO ALL OF THAT AND THERES GEN THIS COMPLEXITY TO IT BUT BUT THE COMPULSION PART CAN BE THAT WE CAN RE ENTER SITUATIONS AT DIDN'T GO WELL WITH THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GOING WEREGAN A FIX WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST WE CAN MAKE OURSELVES FEEL BETTER WEREGING TO TAKE AWAY THE MARK OF TROMIC IS FROM A TROMA DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE CLOCK OR THE CALENDAR SO THAT'S WHY YOU'LL SEE SOME ONE WHO HAS HAD SAY FIVE ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS THAT LOOKED VERY MUCH O THE SAME RIGHT AND IS ABOUT TO ENTER THE SIXTH RIGHT AND HE SAID IT'S NOT BECAUSE HOPEFULLY IN MOST CASES NOT AS THAT PERSON LIKE WANT TO BE HURT RIGHT MEANS SOMETIMES THE DIFFERENT PROBLEM RIGHT BUT BUT THERE CAN BE A DRIVE INSIDE OF US TO TRY AND FIX SOMETHING IF I CAN MAKE IT WORK THIS TIME I WON'T HAVE TO FEEL SO BAD ABOUT THE OTHER FIVE RIGHT SO AN ATTEMPT TO CHANGE THE PAST THROUGH ONE'S CURRENT ACTIONS RIGHT WHICH IS RUDED IN THE LIMBIC SYSTEM AND HOW AND HOW TROMAT AFFECTS US AND HOW AGAIN ITS OUTSIDE THE CLOCK IN THE CALENDARS TO THAT KIND OF MAGIC SO TO SPEAK CAN HAPPEN SO THE BRAIN CAN SEEK THAT MAGIC BUT AGAIN THEIR UNHEALTHY DEFENCES COMING INTO PLAY RIGHT THE THERE HAS TO BE DENIAL RIGHT OTHERWISE THE PERSON WOULD MAP YOU KNOW IF THE SAME THING HAPPENED FIVE TIMES AND THIS LOOKS THE SAME IT'S PROBABLY CAN TO HAPPEN NOW RIGHT SO SO ITY ANY TIME YOU THINK A PERSON MOST OFTEN IT'S US RIGHT YOU KNOW IT IS SMART ENOUGH FOR WORLDLY ENOUGH TO LIKE NO BATTER WHICH IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME RIGHT THAN LOOK FOR THE ANSWER RIGHT SAY WTION THAT PERSON NO BETTER THAN TO GET INTO THE SIX ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP ANSWERS A YES RIGHT  BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT HORRD IF YOU SAW SET A CIRCUMSTANCES FIVE TIMES TO MAP THAT THE SIXES CAN HAVE THE SAME OUTCOME RIGHT THE PERSON WOULD DO THAT IN OTHER CENARIOS RIGHT SO THEN YOU SAY RIGHT THAT IS TRUE SO NOW LET'S LOOK FOR WHY THE PERSON IS DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THAT AND THA GAINT WE GO DOWN INTO THE STRUCTURE OF SELF AND THE FUNCTION OF SELF DEFENCE MECHANISMS IN ACTION SALIENS THE THINGS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT NOW DOES THAT YE MAKE SENSEIN WHAT WAT COMES TO MIND IS THE IDEA OF A'M GETTING INTO A CAR THAT YOU KNOW IS GOING TO GET INTO AN ACCIDENT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT BEING QUIT COGNIZAN OF SAFETY IN ITS IMPORTANTE IN EVERY OTHER DOMAIN OF LIFE YES NOT EVEN J WALKING RIGHT BUT GETTING IN LIKE IF IF CERTAIN UBERS ARRIVED WITH A LITTLE FLASHING LIKE THIS A THIS RIDE IS GOING TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT LIKE GETTING GETTING INTO THAT VEHICLE AND I SEE THIS AN OTHERS AS WELL YES AND AN IT RAISES ALL SORTS OF O QUESTIONS LIKE UM IT I 'S THE PERSON ACTUALLY UNCONSCIOUSLY AFRAID OF THE VEHICLE RIVING WHERE THEY WANT TO GO BECAUSE THEN I'M LIKE ARE PEOPLE ASHLY AFRAID OF THINGS WORKING OUT IM THIS GETS TO SOMETHING THAT THATM SO SERTCAN AT CAN I SAY NOTHAT'S WAY IF THOY KNOW THE PERSON RIGHT LIKE WHO IS THAT PERSON RIGHT WHY DO THEY NOT ONE TO GET IN THAT CAR RIGHT ARE THEY AFRAID THEY'RE KNOCKING GET SOMEWHARTHY FOR THINING TO GET SOMEWHERE RIGHT BUT ULTIMATELY WE'RE LOOKING FOR UNHEALTHY DEFENSEIS AND I I'D SO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THAT ITEAN I WILL OFTEN THINK THAT THE ASPECT OF MY EDUCATION THAT'S MOST HELPFUL IN ME DOING MY JOB WHEN  WHEN I'M IN THE JOB IS AS A PRACTISING SACCHITRIS IS AD USHI MY MATHEMATICS MINER RIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT MORE MATH TO THIS RIGHT PEOPLE NTEND TO THINK ON MENTAL HEALTH THAT'S ALL ITS ALL E SOTERIC AN YOU CAN SO TO SAY ANYTHING IN ANYTHING WE WANT AND THERE'S NO WAY A PROVING OR DISPERINT IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL RIGHT THERE'S A MATHEMATICAL ASPECT TO IT SO IF YOU DO THE CORRECT LOGICAL COMMON SENSE A THING RIGHT IN ALL ASPECTS OF YOUR LIFE EXCEPT ONE AND YOU'RE LIKE A HUNDRED TIMES MORE INTELLIGENT THAN YOU NEED TO BE TO FIGURE IT ALL OUT RIGHT THEN THEN IF THERE'S A CARVE OUT WE SAY LOOK THAT'S OF HUGE INTEREST RIGHT I MEAN THE PROBABILITY THAT WO'RGAN TO FIND SOMETHING INTERESTING THERE'S A HUNDRED PERCENT RIGHT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW BETTER WE KNOW THAT YOU DO BETTER BUT BUT WHY HERE SO LIKE THAT'S SO INTERESTING RIGHT LIKE THAT'S WHERE THE EX MARKS THE SPOTLEC LET'S GO DIG THERE RIGHT SO THAT WHEN WE GO AND DIG THERE LIKE WE'RE ENOUH FIND SOMETHING RIGHT AND AND WA IT WHAT IS THAT I DO WE FIND THAT LIKE OATS IN A RAY OF O REALLY UNHEALTHY DEFENSE MECHANISM MAYBE WE FIND THAT DO WE FIND THAT THERE'S A DEEP UNCONSCIOUS MOTE OVATION RIGHT WEWE MIGHT FIND THAT TOO RIGHT THAT THE WE MIGHT FIND A LOT OF THINGS RIHT BUT WE'RE GOING TO FIND THEM IF WE GO BACK TO WHAT IS THE STRUCTURE OF SELF WHAT IS THE FUNCTION OF SELF IF WE GO AND LOOK LIKE THAT EX MARKS THE SPOT MEANS THERE'S PAY DIRT THERE RIGHT AND THEN WHEN WE FIGU R THAT OUT THEN WE GO THROUGH AND WE CAN MAKE THINGS CHANGE SO IF IT'S A DEEP SEATED TROMA DRIVEN UNCONSCIOUS MOTIVATION THAT IS RESULTING IN AN UNHEALTHY ARRAY OF DEFENSE MECHANISMS WILL LET'S GO LOOK AT THAT RIGHT LET'S LOOK AT THE TROMA LET'S TAKE THE THING THAT'S UNCONSCIOUS AND AND BRING IT TO CONSCIOUSNESS RIGHT THEN WE CAN MAKE THAT BETTER AND THAT A RAY OF UNHEALTHY DEFENSES AND WERE NOT ING TO CHANGE IT OVERNIGHT BUT CAN WE CHANGE IT VERY VERY SIGNIFICANTLY PRETTY RAPIDLY PROBABLY YES AND WE CAN ALMOST ENTIRELY CHANGE IT ACROSS TIME SO THERE'S A MATHEMATICAL ASPECT OF THIS THAT I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT BECAUSE BEAN A MENTAL HEALTH IF DOS N'T EVEN AS A FIELD RIGHT JUST MET WE ALL WANT TO BE MENTALLY HEALTHY THERE'S A RYMAND REASON TO IT THAT YES IT FOLLOWS SCIENCE AND YES IT ALSO FOLLOWS COMMON SENSE AND IF WE APPLY THOSE THINGS WE GET TO ANSWERS VERY REASSURING UM THANK YOU THINKING ABOUT THE FUNCTIONS OF SELF AND AGAIN I JUST TO REMIND MYSELF AND ANOTHER PEOPLE YOU STARTS WIT SELF AWARENESS BOLL'S DEFENSE MECHANISMS IN ACTION THAN THERE'S THE SALIENTS PEACE BUT PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S INSIDE OF US AS WELL AS WHAT'S EXTERNAL AND THEN YOU'RE NOW DESCRIBING LOT OF YOUR CHOICES CHOICE MAKING AND AND BEHAVIOUR IN ACTION IN  LORES I'VE TO SOON THAT WOR FOR THE PERSON TRYING TO IMPROVE THEMSELVES AND GET TO AGENCY AND GRATITUDE A THAT PAYING ATTENTION TO ALL OF THESE IS IS IMPORTANT BUT OF COURSE IF A DEFENSE MECHANISM IS UNCONSCIOUS WE CAN'T SIMPLY DECI LOOK AUT WHEN SEE THE UNCONSCIOUS DEFENSE MECHANISM DOES THAT MEAN THAT WE SHOULD ASK OURSELVES ABOUT WHAT IS MOST SALIENT TO US UM OR SHOULD WE BE FOCUSING ON OUR BEHAVIOURAL CHOICES NOIN THE AMPLE IGES GAVE I'M AWARE OF MY BEHAVIOR OR CHOICES MAKING CERTAIN DECISIONS TO ENGAGE WITH CERTAIN PEOPLE AND AND NOT WITH OTHERS I BUT SHOULD I BE ASKE KING FOR INSTANCE YOU KNOW WHAT SAILING LIKE WHATLIKE WHAT OR THE THOUGHTS LEADING UP TO THAT DECISION A IN OTHER WORDS HOW DOES SAILIENTS OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL A CUSE AND PROCESSES M RELATE TO BEHAVIOR AND WHICH OF THESE SHOULD WE BE PAYING ATTENTION TO IF OUR GOAL IS TO EVENTUALLY CHANGE OUR BEHAVIOR SO SO THINK ABOUT WE'RE STARTING WHET WERE SO STARTING AT THE BOTTOM RIGHT WHO WERE STARTING WITH LOOCATE THERE IS AN EYE RIGHT AND THAT'S JUST NO NOT JUST AN APPREHENSION RIGHT THERE'S A LOT TO THAT RIGHT SO ASO FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW SOMEONE WHO WHO IS DOING SOME MERE MEDITATION STARING INTO THE MIRROR RIGHT LOOKING BACK ITSELF WITH AN WITH A DESIRE TO BE AWARE LIKE THERE IS A ME KE THIS ME IS IN THE WORLD RIGHT THIS IS THE FIRST I'VE EVER HEARD OF SUCH A PRACTICE A EXCEPT WHEN I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCORE MAYBE WAS THE NINTH GRATE I HAD A A TEACHER WHO TALKED ABOUT OOKGAVE US AN ASSIGNMENT TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND AND ASK OURSELVES QUESTIONS BUT IF I UNDERSTAND CRRECTLY YOU THINK THERE'S UTILITY TO PEOPLE SPENDING A FEW MINUTES OR MORE LOOKING IN THE MIRROR AND AND THINKING ABOUT ONESELF AND THE EYES A WAY TO BUILD UP THIS SELF AWARENESS IS YO I HAVE THAT RIGHT IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THE BEST CARE OF YOURSELF THAT YOU CAN RIGT YOU ANTO UNDERSTAND YOURSELF THE BEST YOU CAN YOU ONE TO MAKE YOUR LIFE THE BEST IT CAN BE RIGHT THEN IF THER ANSWERS RANES SAY TO ANSWERS ARE IN FIVE OR TEN DIFFERENT COPBOARS I LOOK IN ALL OF THEM RIGHTLEN THAT'S THAT'S THE IDEA RIHT THAT IF IF WE WANT O KNOW SOMETHING LOOK EVERYWHERE FOR IT AND ALSO REALIZE WHAT WE ARE BUILDING R WHAT WE ARE CREATING MAY BE A RECIPE THERE MAY BE THINGS FROM DIFFERENT CUPBOARDS THAT OVERLAP SO THE WAY TO TRANSLATE THAT PRACTICALLY IS TO SAY TO FIND THE ANSWERS TO WHAT WHAT IS EITHER AILING US WHY WE'RE REPEATING THINGS WE DON'T WANT TO REPEAT OR EVEN IF THINGS ARE GOING O CAY BUT WE WANT THEM TO BE GOING BETTER BECAUSE WE DON'T QUITE FEEL THE PEACE AND CONTENTMENT WE WANT TO FEEL THEN LOOK EVERYWHERE SO IN THE THE FUNCTION OF SELFS IN THE FUNCTION OF SELF START WITH THE EYE RIGHT THE'RE WAYS OF INCREASING SELF AWARENESS YOU KNOW THEY CAN RANGE FROM CONTEMPLATION OFSELF TO MEDITATION TO LOOKING IN THE MIRROR RIGHT THERE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO MORE STRONGLY EMPHASIZED TO OURSELF THAT THERE'S AN EYE AND THIS EYE IS GOING THROUGH LIFE RIGHT THEN WE KNOW THAT THEIR DEFENCE MECHANISMSAN THAT THEIR PRESENT OTHE'RE ACTING IN U'S RIGHT WE CAN'T JUST SEE THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE UNCONSCIOUS BUT IF WE START THINKING ABOUT THEM WE CAN LEARN ABOUT THEM IGHT AND THAT'S WHETE SAILIENCE COMES IN TO PLAY SAILINGS CANT APPOINTS BOTH WAYS RIGHT WE ASSAILINGS CAN POINT US TOWARDS THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND IGHT  I REALIZE I'M DOING THIS OVER AND OVER GAND I'M SAYING THIS THING TO MYSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHERE'S THAT COMING FROM WE STOR BECOMING CURIOUS ABOUT OURSELVES AND WE LOOK TO THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND AND THEN WE ALSO LOOK TO THE CONSCIOUS MINE THAT THAT'S WHY AFTER SAILIENCE IS BEHAVIOUR RT WHAT AM I DOING RIGHT AN A LOT OF TIMES WE DON'T KNOW JUST AT EXAMPLES OF WE DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE DOING THINGS RIGHT SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO LOSE WAGT BUT ALWAYS GOES TO THE GROCESRAND COMES HOME AND IS LIKE HAS SOME SENSE OF SURPRISE THAT THERE THINGS THERE THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO EAT RIGHT  WHY M I BEHAVING IN A CERTAIN WAY WHT IS CERTAIN THINGS BOTHER ME WHEN OTHER THINGS DON'T RIGHT MY MI REALLY TOUCHY ABOUT ONE THING AND NOT ANOTHER WHY MIGHT THERE BE THINGS THAT BOTHER OTHERS AND NOT ME OR VICE VERSA RHT SO SO YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF US AND THEN HOW WE RESPOND RIHT BECAUSE HOW WHAT MAY BE UPSETTING ME OR WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF ME BOTH CONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS RIGHT IS THEN DETERMINING HOW I'M ACTING HOW BEHAVING IN THE WORLD AROUND ME IF I WANT A BETTER JOB BUT I NEVER TAKE AN INTERVIEW FOR ANOTHER JOB I'M NOT GOING TO GET ANOTHER JOB IF I WANT A ROMANTIC PARTNER BUT I AUTOMATICALLY TURN AWAY FROM ANYONE WHO SMILES AT ME I'M NOT ING TO HAVE A ROMANTIC PARTNER RIGHT IF I WANT WLIFE TO BE BETTER AND THERE'S A CERTAIN THING I REPEAT AND I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT THAT I WANT TO UNDERSTAND MYSELF BETTER SO I CAN CHANGE THE BEHAVIOUR AND THAT'S WHY THE THE THE FUNCTION OF SELF ANDS WITH STRIVINGS RIGT E STRIVINGS ARE INTO THE FUTURE I KNOW THERE ISNAN EYE I KNOW THERE'S A NET WORK AND WEB OF DEFENCE MECHANISMS IN ACTION I KNOW THAT THERE'S SAILINS GOING ON INSIDE OF ME AND A MULIGAN TO PAY ATTENTION TO A FEW THINGS FROM THE THOUSANDS I COULD PAY ATTENTION TO I WANT TO BE AWARE OF THAT AND HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER THAT THEN I'M ENACTING BEHAVIORS I'M ENGAGING IN THE WORLD AROUND ME AND ULTIMATELY I WANT THINGS RIGHT I WANT LIFE TO BE BETTER I WANT TO HAVE THAT FEELING THAT YOU CAN GET TO I WANT TO BE IN THE STATE OF OF AGENCY ANGRATITUDE SO AGAIN THESE TWO PILLARS STRUCTURE OF SELF FUNCTION OF SELF THAT'S WHERE ALL THE ANSWERS ARE SO THEY'RE ALL THE CUPBOARDS RIGHT THERE THERE THESE FIVE CUPBOARDS IN THE STRUCTURE OF SELF AND FIVE IN THE FUNCTION OF SELF AND I KNOW TE'LL BE A YOU WILL HAVE IT OUT THERE IN A PEDIEV RIGHT ECAUSE YOU CAN GO BACK THERE AND THAT'S WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY OF ANSWERS ARE TO BOTH UNDERSTANDING AND ROUTES TO CHANGE WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED IS INCREDIBLY HELPFUL AIT'S ABSOLUTELY APPARENT TO ME WHY LOOKING IN ALL THE CUPBOARDS ITS SO KEY IT'S ALSO APPARENT THAT A MANY DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHAATRY AM AT LEAST AS I UNDERSTAND THEM MY PROBE A FERENCE IS JUST AT THE LEVEL OF BEHAVIOR YOU KNOWI THING THIS IS THE THAT DOESN'T DO IT MOI WELL JUST DO THE RIGHT THING IT IIF YOU KNOW Y YOU'RE NOT FINDING A ROMANTIC PARTNER LIKE YOU'LL CEDUAL THREE DINNERS WITH FRIENDS AND ASKED THEM TO INVITE OVER PEOPLEWO ARE LOOKING FOR PART OF SOUNDS REALLY SIMPLE RIGHT BUT A'M MUCH AS WITH THE EXAMPLE OF MY FRIEND WHO LOST ALL THIS WAY THROUGH BEHAVIORAL CHANGE THE THE FEAR STILL LIVES WITHIN EM VERY VERY STRONGLY AND SO CLEARLY THERE'S SOME SOME STUFF HAPPENING UNDERNEATH THE'RE NOT FORTUNATELY HE DID LOSE THE WAITINGS KEPT MOST OF IT OFF BUT IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT UNTIL HE ADDRESSED TO SOME OF THESE OTHER ISSUES OF SALIENCE AND A DEFENSE MECHANISM SELF AWARE IN A ET CETERA THAT A THE FEAR HE STILL EXPERIENCING MAKES TOTAL SAIDS BECAUSE THE FOUNDATION OF THAT CHANGE IS NOT NEARLY AS STRONG AS IT COULD BE AM MAYBE THEI M AYBE IT ISN'T AP TO HAVE THE FEAR BUT HE'S NOT CN TO LEARN EITHER ONE WITHOUT THE EXPLORATION SO YEU WON'T IF THERE IS RISK HE WON'T BE ABLE TO AVERT THE RISK AND IF THERE'S NOT RISK THESE THEN TO TO LABORING THROUGH LIFE WHICH IS DIFFICULT ENOUGH WITHOUT BEING WORRIED ABOUT SOMETHING YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE WORRIED ABOUT RA TO THE PROCESS OF INQUIRY WILL ALWAYS MAKE THAT BETTER IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT HIS FEAR OF REGAINING WAIGT IS ABSOLUTELY SAPPING HIS ENJOYMENT AND HIS PRODUCTIVITY ANOTHER DOMAINS SOF FLIMTO WARRANTS A TENTION RIGTVE IS BECAUSE WE'RE DECIDING I THAT' SO A MATHEMATICAL WAY IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY DOES IT MEAN IT CAN CHANGE OVERNIGHT BUT IT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AND IT CAN BE CHANGED WHAT'S FOR THAT REASON AN MANY OTHER REASONS THAT I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT YOU EXPLAIN THESE TWO PILLARS STRUCTURE OF SELF AND FUNCTION OF SELF AND HOW THES FLOW UP TO  EMPOWERMENT AND HUMILITY AND HOW THOSE FLOW UP TO AGENCY AND GRATITUDE YOU'VE GIVEN US A ING A SET OF IDEALS IN I N AND A ROAD MAP OF OF HOW TO GET THERE AND ONE THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE WITH IN A MOMENT HERE I'M I DID WANT TO REITERATE WHAT YOU SAID WHICH IS THAT THERE IS A PEDIAPH VERSION OF THIS THE STRUCTURE THIS ROAD MAP OF IDEALS AND HOW TO GET THERE IM THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED AS A LINCOLN THE SHOWN OUT CAPTIONS I'M SO PEOPLE CAN REFER TO THEM THEY'RE AN INVISUAL FORM IF THEY LIKE IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING YOURSELF AND IN HAVING GOODNESS IN YOUR LIFE AS MUCH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN THEN YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE MIND AND THIS MEANS THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND IN ALL THE THINGS THAT GO ON A MILLION THINGS A SECOND THAT WE DON'T NO OR UNDERSTAND ONE BY ONE BUT THAT WE CAN EXPLORE AND UNDERSTAND BETTER IN TOTAL WE'RE ALSO INTERESTED IN THE CONSCIOUS MIND IN BEING SELFUL WARE WE'RE INTERESTED IN THE ARRAY OF DEFENCE MECHANISMS AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY THERE ELEGANT AND LIGHT PASSES CLEARLY THROUGH THEM OR WHETHER THER DISTORTING LIGHT IN CREATING MISPERCEPTION IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE MIND THEN YOU'RE ALSO INTERESTED IN THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE LIC WHAT IS YOUR CHARACTER STRUCTURE WHAT IS THE NAST AROUND ALL OF IT HOW E INTERFACE WITH THE WORLD AND THEN YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THE SELF THAT YOU GROW FROM THAT PHENOMENOLOGICALLY MEANING WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE OFSELF HOW DOES IT FEEL TO YOU THESE ARE ALL IMPORTANT PARTS OF THIS PILLAR OF HEALTH AND HAPPINESS THE OTHER PILLAR IS THE FUNCTION OF THE MIND AND OF COURSE THERE'S OVERLAPE THEIRE DIFFERENT CUPBORS BUT THE CUPBOARDS ALL CONTAIN DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS THAT TOGETHER MAKE THE RECIPE SO IF WE'RE INTERESTED IN THE FUNCTION OF THE MIND THEN WE WANT TO PAY ATTENTION THAT THERE'S AN EYE WE WANT TO BE SELF AWARE AND WE WANT A CULTIVATE SELF AWARENESS WE'RE ALSO INTERESTED IN HOW THOSE DEFENCE MECHANISMS WORK WHEN THEY'RE IN ACTION RIT WHAT SALIENT INSIGHT OF US AND OUTSIDE OF US WHAT WE PAYING ATTENTION TO HOW WE BEHAVING WHAT ARE OUR STRIVINGS DO WE FEEL HOPEFUL ABOUT OURSELVES IN THE WORLD AROUND US AND IF WE'RE INTERESTED IN ALL OF THESE THINGS WE CAN'T HELP BUT BE RESPECTFUL IT OF JUST HOW COMPLICATED THIS IS LIKE LIFE IS DIFFICULT AND UNDERSTANDING OURSELVES IS IS DIFFICULT IN WONDERFUL JOY CAN COME OF LIVING LIFE BUT IT IS HARD AND ITS HARD DAY BY DAY AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND OURSELVES GOING TO THESE PLACES THESE PILLARS THAT HOLD THE ANSWERS THEY THEY CAN'T BUT MAKE IN US A RESPECT FOR ALL OF IT AND THE RESPECT FOR OURSELVES FOR OTHERS BRINGS WITH IT HUMILITY WHEN WE COME TO THIS POINT OF LOOKING AT OURSELVES AND EXPLORING THAN YES WE BECOME EMPOWERED  BECAUSE WE'VE GAINED A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE WE'RE DIGGING WHERE THE PAY DIRIT IS WERE FIGURING THINGS OUT AND ALONG WITH THAT IMPOWERMENT COMES HUMILITY A RESPECTFULNESS FOR HOW DIFFICULT ALL THIS IS HOW COMPLICATED WE ARE HOW WE CAN MAKE HAPPINESS IN OUR LIVES BUT HOW IT CERTAINLY IS AN EASY AND WE TAKE WITH US THE EMPOWERMENT AND THE HUMILITY AND WE EXPRESS THEM AND IF WE'RE EXPRESSING EMPOWERMENT AND HUMILITY WE COME TO LIVING THROUGH O AGENCY AND GRATITUDE SO HERE BOTH ARE ACTIVE WORDS SO AGENCY ITS IT'S EASIER TO SEE IT IT'S AN ACTIVE WORD WHERE I'M AWARE OF MY ABILITY TO TO PROJECT MYSELFE INTO THE WORLD AROUND ME I KNOW THAT I CAN'T CONTROL EVERYTHING BUT I'M REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT CAN I CONTROL RIGHT HOW CAN I CONTROL IT WHAT TO MY DECISIONS NOW LEA TUDE IN THE FUTURE SO AGENCY IS VERY VERY ACTIVE GRATITUDE IS ACTIVE TOO RIHT AS WE'RE BRINGING AN ACTIVE SENSE OF GRATITUDE SENSE OF THE AMAZINGNESS THAT WERE HERE AND AND PRIDE IN OURSELVES AND OTHERS FOR BEING HERE AND AND TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD AS BEST WE CAN AND THEN WE BRING THAT TO OUR INTERACTIONS WERE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A KIND GESTURE TOWARDS OTHERS INSTEAD OF BEING ANGRY WERE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO HAVE SOMETHING COMPASSIONATE TO SAY INCLUDING TO OURSELVES THAN WE ARE TO HAVE SOMETHING ANGRY TO SAY THAT GRATITUDE ACCOMPANIES AGENCY THEIR THEIR ACTIVE WORDS AND THEIR ACTIVE TOGETHER AND IF WE'RE LIVING LIFE THROUGH AGENCY AND GRATITUDE MAND THERE'S A LOT OF WISDOM ABOUT THIS IS A LOT HAS BEEN WRITTEN AND RESEARCHD ABOUT THIS AND IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS IT TELLING US RIGHT MEMBER THINGS ARE GETTING SIMPLER RIGHT AS WE'RE GETTING HIGHER UP THE THE LEVELS HERE RIGHT THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS MOST COMPLICATED NOW WERE AT I CAN WE LIVE OUR LIVES WITH AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AT THE FOREFRONT AND WHAT DOES IT BRING FOR US AND I THINK IT BRINGS WHAT WE ARE SEEKING THAT WE MIGHT SOOK KE WERE SEEKING HAPPINESS AND THAT CAN MEAN A LOT OF THINGS IT A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT CAN BE A VERY ACTIVE THING MY HAPPY IN THE MOMENT AND WE CAN USE HAPPINESS SOMETIMES TO DISTRACT OURSELVES LIKE HAPPINESS IS IMPORTANT BUT WORDS WHAT WHEN PEOPLE REALLY THINK LIKE WHAT IS IT THAT THEY WANT OR WHAT IS IT THAT THEY HAVE RIGT IF THER THE THER OVERJOY TO BE ALIVE THEIR FINDING A SENSE OF PEACE THEIR FINDING CONTENTMENT THEIR FINDING DELIGHT THE ABILITY TO BE DELIGHTED THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE WANT OR OR OUR HUMAN HISTORY IT ARE OUR SEARCHINGS TELL US THIS IN OUR OWN EXPERIENCES TELL US THIS AND AND NOW IT COULD LEAD A PERSON TO THINK WHELE AN WHAT'S GOING ON MIN IS IS THIS SOME ONE WHOIS IN A LEVITATING AT THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN LIKE IS THIS JUST A STATE IS A A STATE THEF PEOPLE ARE IN AND AND THE INSWERS NO BE SOMETIMES WE COULD BE IN THAT STATE WHERE WE CAN FEEL PEACE THERE'S NO TENSION INSIDE OF US RITH I CAN FEEL TO HAVE TIMES WHEN I DON'T FEEL TENSION INSIDE OF ME THERE'S CONTENTMENT THERE'S PEACE AN OFT TO DRIVE TOWARDS ANYTHING BUT IT'S NOT THE PASSIVE EXPERIENCE OF IT BECAUSE WE ARE LIVING LIFE IT'S THAT THAT FEELING GOES HAND IN HAND WITH A DRIVE WITHIN US THAT WE'RE WHEN WE'RE IN THIS HEALTHY PLACE WE ARE LIVING LIFE THE DECISIONS THAT WE'RE MAKING WHAT IS PUTTING THE RUBBER TO THE ROAD IT IS A GENERATIVE DRIVE WITHIN US THERE IS A DRIVE TO MAKE THINGS BETTER TO UNDER STAND TO EXPLORE AND IT'S THAT DRIVE THAT WE ACCESS AND CULTIVATE AND SYNONYMOUS WITH HAPPINESS IS IT'S NOT JUST THE STATE WHEN PEOPLE WANT TO BE HAPPY IN THAT VERY VERY GENERAL WAY YES CONTENTMENT PEACE DELIGHT BUT BUT THERE HAPPENING AS WE'RE LIVING LIFE RIG AS WE'RE ENACTING A GENERATIVE DRIVE WERE WE'RE LOOKING AT OURSELVES IN THE WORLD AROUND US AND WE'RE INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING WE'RE INTERESTED IN MAKING THINGS BETTER AND THAT'S THE PLACE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO I BELIEVE THAT WITH ALL MY WITH ALL MY HEART AND MY AND MY BRAIN BY MY EDUCATION TRAINING EXPERIENCE AND ALSO EXPERIENCE LIVING LIVING LIFE AND AND FOR TWENTY YEARS DOING THIS WORK WITH PEOPLE TELLS ME THIS IS WHAT WE'RE SEEKING AND IT'S AN ACTIVE WAY OF OF EXPERIENCING OURSELVES AND OUR PLACE IN LIFE I LOVE THAT BECAUSE IT MERGES BOTH THE NOUNDS AND THE ADJUCTIVES AND THE VERBS NOW AN AND THISS NOTION OF A GENERATIVE DRIVE TO ME IS SO COMPELLING BECAUSE I' I HAVE THE SENSE AND I HOPE I'M RIGHT THAT WE ALL  HAVE SOME SORT OF GENERATIVE DRIVE WITHIN US STARTING AT AN EARLY STAGE I'M MAYBE TEVEN STARTS AYS VISUAL FORAGING ER TOUCHING THINGS WITH OUR HANDS AS AN INFANT AND IT YOU EXPLORATION OF THE WORLD RIGHT IT IS WHAT BRINGS ABOUT THE CHANGES IN THE NARL CIRCUITORY THAT ALLOW US TO ENGAGE EVEN MORE AND IN AN I PROGRESSIVELY ON THE ONE HAND NARROWER WAYS BUT ALSO WITH MORE RICHNESS AND EMMORE DETAIL I' COULD YOU TELL US MORE ABOUT GENERATIVE DRIVE AND AND HOW THIS SHOWS UP IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE I'M IS IT ALWAYS POSITIVE CAN THERE BE TOO MUCH OF IT 'M I CERTAINLY KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED TO WORK FOR THOSE WE LISTENING I'M RAISING MY HAND IM BUT I WOULD SAY NOWADAYS I'M NOT AS ADDICTED TO WORK AS I ONCE WAS IN THE SENSE THAT I DERIVE FAR MORE SATISFACTION FROM LESS WORK NOW PROVIDED THAT THE WORK IS REALLY IN DEPTH YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THERE WERE YEARS AN IN GRADUATE SCHOOL WHERE I WANTED TO PUBLISH A BUNCH OF PAPERSAND THEN QUICKLY REALIZED I'M THROUGH THE A NOT SO GENTLE PERSUASION OF MY MYMENTORS THAT  LET JUST DO THE BEST POSSIBLE WORK WE CAN DO AND THERES SO MUCH MORE RICHNESS AND AN EXPERIENCE AND THINGS TO BE GAINED FROM THAT SO I'M FAMILIAR WITH GENERATIVE DRIVE AS AS I UNDERSTAND IT BUT MAYBE IF YOU WOULD IF YOU COULD FLUSH OUT A BIT OF WHAT GENERATIVE DRIVE IS AND AND DOES IT ARRIVE I' IN PARALLEL WITH OR BEFOR WE ARE ABLE TO ACCESS PEACE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT 'M CAN IT EVEN BE SEPARATED OUT FROM THAT I'M ON WAT WHAT IS THE GENERATIVE DRIVE YO SO DRIVES ARE BUILT INTOS SO THAT THET THE SYNONYMOUS WITH OUR EXISTENCE IF WE EXIST THEN THEN WE HAVE THE DRIVE AND THAT THAT'S HOW THE DRIVE IS TO FINED I AND WE UNDERSTAND OING FAR BACK TO TO PSYCHODYNAMIC AND PSYCHOANALYTIC ROOTS AND AND WHEN PEOPLE REALLY THINKING HARD ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS AND WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF US THAT WE'VE SO TO IDENTIFIED AND N VALIDATED OVER THE THE PERIOD OF TIME SINCE THAT WE HAVE AGGRESSIVE DRIVES WITHIN US AND WE HAVE DRIVES TOWARDS PLEASURE NOW THIS OFTEN GETS MISUNDERSTOOD THAT SO AGGRESSION IT CAN BE IT CAN BE ACTIVE VIOLENT AGGRESSION FOR EXAMPLE BUT  AGGRESSION CAN ALSO BE A SU A SENSE OF AGENCY RIGHT I THE INACTION OF AGENCY LIKE I I WANT TO DO THINGS AN WANT CHANGE THINGS AT WANT IT I WANT TO MAKE THE WORLD A DIFFERENT PLACE RIGHT THAT THAT ALL OF THAT COMES UNDER THIS DRIVE SO SO AGGRESSIV AND AGGRESSIVE DRIVE IS NOT A BAD THING IF WE HAD NO AGGRESSIVE DRIVES THE THOUGHT AS WOULD JUST LIE DOWN AND NOTHING ELSE WOULD HAPPEN AND T WE'D ALL BE GONE RIGHT SO SO THERE'S A WAY IN WHICH THIS DRIVE WITHIN US MOVES US FORWARD RIGHT AND OF COURSE EXTREMELY COMPLICATED THE WAYS WE CAN MANIFEST TOO MUCH OF IT OR TOO LITTLE OF IT OR HOW OUR DEFENSE MECHANISMS CAN ENTERTWINE WITH THE DRIVE BUT THE DRIVE IS THERE ITS LIKE ITS FUEL WITH IN US THAT COMES WITH OUR EXISTENCE AND THEN HOW THAT FUEL MOVES US FULWORD HOW MUCH OF IT THERE IS NO THAT IT IS DETERMINED BY THE MASHING OF THE DRIVE WITH HOW WE'RE LIVING LIFE IHT AND THE SAME WOULD BE TRUE OF PLEASURE NO THE PLEASURE DRIVE DOESN'T JUST MEAN THAT WE ALL WANT TO BE HIDDENUS RI INSIDE IT MEANS THAT WE WANT THINGS THAT ARE GRATIFYING RIGHT WE WANT TO FEEL GOOD RIGHT THIS ISN'T JUS YOU KNOW THE DRIVE TOWARDS PHYSICAL PLEASURE LIKE A SEX DRIVE OR OR EATING FOOD OR HAVING COMFORT LIKE ALL OF THAT CAN BE PART OF IT BUT IT'S A DRIVE FOR RELIEF RIGHT THE IDEA THAT WE DON'T WANT TO BE WHITE KNUCKLING LIFE RIGHT SEARCHING FOR PLEASURE SOS HAVING AGGRESSION WITHIN US AS WE WHITE KNUCKLE LIFE AND WE SEARCH FOR SOME PLEASURE AND AND RELIEF RIGHT THESE DRIVES WITHIN US CAN BE HEALTHY THEY CAN BE UNHEALTHYO THEY CAN BE ANYTHING RIGHT THERE THERE THERE WELLSPRINGS WITHIN US THAT THEN FUEL US FORWARD AND THERE'S CONTROVERSY TO THE IDEA IS THERE EGENERATIVE DRIVE AND THERE CERTAINLY TAT PARTS OF THE FIELD THAT DO NOT THINK SO BUT THERE HAVE BEEN STRONG THINKERS IN THE FIELD THAT HAVE THOUGHT WE DO HAVE A GENERATIVE DRIVE THAT IT IS WITHIN US TO LOOK AROUND US TO BE CURIOUS TO BE AMAZED IGHT TO THINK IKE HOW HOW CAN I ENGAGE WITH THIS AND MAKE THIS BETTER OR HAPPY OR TO THINK OUTSIDE OF OURSELVES RIGHT TO THINK IF I AVE IF I FEEL GOOD AND YURE IN PAIN CAN I MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER RIGHT WE HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH ME RIGHT THE IDEA OF ALTUISM HCOMING TO THE FORE IN HAVING INDUSTRIOUSNESS WITH US WITHIN U RIGHT AND AND THE IDEA THAT THERE IS  GENERATIVE DRIVE IT ITS STRENGTHEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW HUMANS BEHAVE WHEN IT WE'RE NOT STRUGGLING RIGHT THAT THAT PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN LEARNING AND WE THINK ABOUT HOW HOW MUCH OF PEOPLE GIVE OF THEMSELVES TO LEARNING RIGHT OR DESERVING OTHER LIKE THERE'S SO MUCH OF THIS GOODNESS IN THE WORLD AROUND US NOW IF WE SHUT PEOPLE AWAY RIGHT AVE NO IMAGINE OU KNOW GOD FORBID SOMEONE IS IN A SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FROM WHEN THER THE MOMENTS ARE BORN YOU KNOW THEN THAT THERE'S NOT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE GENERATIVE DRIVE TO THRIVE RIGHT AND WE SEE SO MANY SO MANY SITUATIONS WHERE IT DOESN'T THRIVE ENOUGH RIHT YO KNOW TO VIOLENCE IN PEOPLE'S SURROUNDINGS LACK OF OPPORTUNITIES  THATTHAT WE CAN SQUELCH A GENERATIVE DRIVE ANY ONE'S GENERATIVE DRVE BUT IF WE GIVE OURSELVES OPPORTUNITIES IF YOU KNOW IF WE'RE HEALTHY THAT WE ARE NOT WEIGHD DOWN BY TROMA AND ILLNESS AND MISPERCEPTIONS OFSELVES WHEN WE CAN LIVE LIFE IN A WAY THAT BRINGS US TO AGENCY AND GRATITUDE NOW WE'RE A LYING WITH THE GENERATIVE DRIVE THAT I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE IS WITHIN US I THINK JUST LOOK AT LIFE LOOK AT HUMAN BEINGS WE OBSERVE THAT WE HAVE THIS DRIVE WITHN US AND IF THAT DRIVE IS AT THE FOREFRONT AND THAT DRIVE THEN NATURALLY OF COURSE ALIES WITH AGENCY AND GRATITUDE THAN I THINK WERE AT THE PLACE THAT IS THE PLACE WE WE ULTIMATELY SEEK I AND THAT WE CAN FIND IT FOR BRIEF PERIODS OF TIME SO SO BY REALLY PURSUING THIS AND AND  REALLY STRONGLY IN MY OWN THERAPY IN REFLECTION AND ATTEMPTS TO UNDERSTAND I CAN HAVE PERIODS OF TIME WHERE I CAN FEEL THAT WAY I I CAN FEEL OUTWARD GROWTH AND INTEREST IN THE WORLD AND AND I FEEL GOOD I'M NOT TRYING TO ANSWER SOME QUESTION LIKE WHY MY LIVE OR I'M DOING THINGS THAT I FEEL GOOD ABOUT AND I FEEL GOOD ABOUT DOING THOSE THINGS IN ABOUT BEING IN THE WORLD AND AND I THINK THIS IS NOT UNCOMMON YOU KNOW IT MAY BE FAR MORE COMMON IN SOCIETIES THAT ARE ALLEGEDLY LESS ADVANCED RIGHT THAT IS AVE LESS DISTRACTIONS OR MAYBY YOU KNOW LESS A KNOWLEDGE OF ALL ALL HE AWFUL THINGS IN THE WORLD THAT CAN HAPPEN TO US THAT ARE CONSTANTLY FED TO US LIKE THIS THER WHOLE MUCH OF OTHER QUESTIONS AND TOPICS ABOUT IT BUT BUT THIS THIS YOU A THIS ABSOLUTE BELIEF THAT THERE'S THIS GENERATIVE DRIVING US THAT WANTS TO ALE WITH AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AND THAT WE ALL HAVE IT WITHIN US TO BRING THOSE TO THE FOREFRONT AND TO FIND THAT THING THAT WE SEEK WHETHER SOME ONE'S PERSON SAYS ITS N NIRVANA THE OTHER PERSON SAYS IT'S JOY OR HAPPINESS OR PEACE OR NUMBING WE KNOW WHATEVER IT IS THERE'S THERE'S SOMETHING TO IT WERE WE'RE NOT FEELING THE TENSION WITHIN US WERE NOT FEELING THE ANXIETY THE PRESSURES BHAT WERE FEELING A SENSE OF GOODNESS THE WAY YOU'RE DESCRIBING IT AM MAKES PERFECT SENSE WHY PEACE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT BE SO CLOSELY LINKED TO THIS GENERATIVE DRIVE NOT THE THE WORD PEACE AS S YOU ALLUDED TO S OFTEN AM BRINGS TO MIND THE IDEA O PASSIVITY BUT GENERATIVE DRIVE AND THE INCLUSION OF THINGS LIKE AGGRESSION AND A DRIVE FOR PLEASURE ARE ANYTHING BUT PASSIVE OT SO ITHING THAT'S IMPORTANT  FOR ME AND FOR EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND THAT A PEACE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT CAN REALLY BE ACTION TERMS AGAIN MO MOVING THEM FROM A YOU KNOW FROM THE MORE TYPICAL CONCEPTION OF THEM TO DIVERB STATES SO PEACE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT ARE NOT PASSAGE STATES THERE CAN BE PERIODS OF TIME WHERE WE CAN BE JUST VERY PEACEFUL AND VERY MUCH AT REST BUT BUT THOSE WORDS ARE NOT SYNONYMOUS WITH INACTION  IN FACT THE SYNONYMOUS WITH ACTION A LOT OF THE TIME  IF WE ARE SUFFUSED WITH PEACE CONTENTMENT THE ABILITY TO DELIGHT THAND WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WERE RAISING UP THE GENERATIVE DRIVE WE'RE MAKING CONDITIONS THAT ARE PERMISSIVE FOR THE GENERATIVE DRIVE TO COME TO THE FOREFRONT RIGHT TO BE PARAMOUNT OVER THE AGGRESSIVE AND THE PLEASURE DRIVES AN REMEMBER WE'RE NOT TRYING TO GET RID OF THOSE DRIVES T WE JUST WANT THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IN US TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT THEND WILL BE ABLE TO HARNESS THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE THROUGH FOR EXAMPLE A STRONG SENSE OF AGENCY FUELING THE SENSE OF AGENCY FORWARD AS OPPOSED TO DESTRUCTIVE AGGRESSION RIGHT THE SEARCH FOR PLEASURE WHICH SURE CAN INCLUDE PHYSICAL PLEASURES AND IN WAYS THAT ARE GOOD AND REASONABLE AND HEALTHY FOR US BUT ALSO THE PLEASURE OF LEARNING T THE PLEASURE THAT ALTRUISM BRINGS THAT WE CAN TAKE THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE THAT WE KNOW IS IN US AND THE PLEASURE DRIVE THAT WE KNOW IS IN US AND WE CAN DILE THEM TO THE RIGHT PLACES LIKE THIS GETS VERY COMPLICATED AND IT'S EASY TO DIL THAT TOO FAR UP AND IT'S EASY TO DILIT TOO FAR DOWN BUT IF BOTH ARE SERVING THE GENERATIVE DRIVE BECAUSE WE LIFT UP THE GENERATIVE DRIVE AND WE BRING IT TO PRIMACY THAT BEING ABLE TO HANDLE OUR LIVES TO UNDERSTAND OURSELVES TO GO BACK TO THOSE PILLARS AND TO BUILD UPON IT THE AGENCY AND THE GRATITUDE THAT THEN LEADS US TO PEACE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT WE CAN PUT ALL OF THIS TOGETHER AND LIKE WE'RE REALLY AND TRULY LIVING IN AN ACTIVE WAY IN THE WORLD THAT'S GOOD FOR US GOOD FOR THE WORLD AROUND US AND DOESN'T LEAVE US WITH THE SENSE OF YEARNING OR SENSE OF TENTION WITHIN US OYOU THINK IT'S ALSO THECATE THAT GENERATIVE DRIVE HAS KIND OF A AM SELF AMPLIFICATION FEATURE TO IT WHAT COMES TO MIND AS YOUR DESCRIBING GENERATIVE DRIVE IN ITS RELATIONSHIP TO PECE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT IS THAT APPROXIMATELY A HALF HOUR AFTER I WAKE UP I START TO FEEL IM MORE PHYSICALLY ENERGISED I'M NOT SOMEBODY WHO JUST POPS OUT OF IT AS RATY T GO EXERCISE OR DUE MENTAL WORK A BUT ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES OR SO AFTER WAKING MY MY MIND STARTS TO WAKE UP AND I'VE NOTICE THAT IF I READ A SCIENTIFIC PAPER OR IF I READ A CHAPTER IN A BOOK OR IF I DO SOMETHING THAT FEELS A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT COGNITIVELY DIFFICULT IN PARTICULAR THAT AM THE SENSE OF SATISFACTION THAT I GET FROM THAT IS IMMENSE AND IT IT'S NOT NECERI THE CASE THAT I HAVE TO LEARN SOMETHING THAT I'M GOING TO USE THAT DAY BUT FOR ME LEARNING AND M AND OFTEN LEARNING AND SHARING WHAT I LEARN WITH THE WORLD WHETHER ANOTHER WHENT I HEAR IT OR NOT AM IT IS PART OF MY A PLEASURE LOOP AND UM AND I'VE LEARNED THAT IF I DON'T CAPTURE SOME NEW KNOWLEDGE IN A WAY THAT'S CHALLENGING AM IN THE MORNING TIME UM I I FEEL LIKE THE YEARS ARE STILL TURNING BUT BUT I STARTS IT AND LOSE ENERGY WHEREAS IF I FIND SOMETHING INTERESTING AN PARTICULAR AND AND I WRITE IT DOWN AND AND I FEEL LIKE I OWN IT THAT'S WHAT I ENJOY SO MUCH ABOUT LEARNINGS LIKE IT'S IN THERE MAYBE IT'LL BE USEFUL AT SOME POINT MAYBE IT WON'T THAT'S LIKE A IT'S LIKE A ANIMAL FINDING A TOOL THAT IT CAN MAY BE USED TO FORAGE MOR MORE EFFECTIVELY LATER IN LIFE I I GET SUCH A SENSE OF SATISFACTION HAT THAN I FIND THAT I HAVE IMMENSE ENERGY TO DO WHATEVERIS NEXT WHETHER NOT THAT'S EXERCISE OR LEARN MORE OR I PREPARE PODCAST OR WRITE A GRANTS OR I RAN WORK ON A PAPER AND THIS FEATURE OF MY MENTAL LIFE HAS IS SO PROMINENT THAT UM I ALMOST SU TO FORCE MYSELF TO DO IT EACH DAY AND THERE ARE SO MANY DISTRACTIONS IN THE WORLD NOWADAYS THAT I'VE COME TO A PLACEWHERE I ALMOST HAVE TO FORCE MYSELF TO DO WHAT I KNOW WORKS FOR ME UM BUT WHEN I DO IIT FEELS LIKE A ALMOST LIKE I CHEMICAL ROCKET FUEL  IT DOESN'T MAKE ME MANIC OR CRAZY I DON'T NED TO PICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL  SOMEBODY OR TELL EVERYBODY ABOUT OR POST ON SOCIAL MEDIA IT'S MORE OF A DEEP SENSE OF SATISFACTION AND AND I GET ENERGY FROM IT IS THAT THE GENERATIVE DRUM WAS GREAT THAT THAT WORKS FOR YOU WHAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT FOR YOU LIKE YOU CAN PRIME YOU'R GENERATIVE DRIVE THAT WAY RIGHT AND THEN YOU PRIMEATE AS YOU PRIME THE POMP A GETS REVED UP RIGHTLIK THEN AND THEN YOU KNO IT'S S REALLY MANIFESTING ITSELF INSIDE OF YOU MEAN THERE IS MANY DIFFERENT MANIFESTATIONS OF THE GENERATIVE DRIVE AS THERE ARE PEOPLE RIGHT SO SOMETHINGS IN WORK FOR SOME PERSON OTHER THINGS CAN WORK FOR DIFFERENT PERSON RIHT BUT BUT BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT HEY I KNOW THIS THING WORKS FOR ME AND EVEN THOUGH SOMETIMES IS NOT EASY TO DO I DO IT AND THEN LOOK WHAT IT GETS FOR ME RIGHT AND THAT THAT'S THAT'S REALLY HEALTHY RIGHT AS LIKE KNOWING THAT THIS THING WORKS FOR YOU AND THEN YOU BECOME COMMITTED TO IT BECAUSE YOUR GENERATIVE DRIVE AS IS IS REALLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED BY IT RIGHT AND THEN YOU HAVE THI SENSE OF GOOD FEELING RIGHT SO THEN YOU HAVE THAT YOU HAVE THE PEACE AND YOU HAVE THEYOU'VE JUST OVER ALL SENSE OF GOODNESS RIGHT THEE YO PIECE AND CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT YOUYOU'RE GETTING THAT IN LEARNING AND IN TEACHING SO TO YOU YOURE FIGURING OUT LIKE HEY THIS WORKS FOR ME RIGHT AND GAN YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT THROUGH THIS LAND AS IF WE FIND PARTS AT AREN'T WORKING THEN WE GO BACK AND WE FIGURE THEM OUT RIHT MAYBE A GOOD EXAMPLE MAYBE IS A SO LISAY YOU TAKE SOME ONE WHO RELIC ENJOYS GARDENING AND GET SOMETHING OUT OF GARDENING RIGHT SO THEY'RE AS MANY GENERATIVE DRIVES AND HOW THEY'RE MEASURED OUT AS THERE ARE HUMANS BUT THERE CAN BE COMMON OUTCOMES OF THAT RIGHT SO THE ENJOYMENT OF OF FOSTERING PLANTS GROWING A GARDEN IS THAT THAT'S NOT UNCOMMON IN HUMANS RIGHT SO IMAGIN SOME ONE WHO HASN'T BEEN DOING THAT RIGHT THEY REALLY WANT TO THEY'VE A DRIVE TO DO IT THERE'S THE PLOT OF LAND IN THE BACK THAT THEY USED TO CULTIVATE RIGHT SO IF THEY'RE NOT DOING IT THE'RE ANY NUMBER OF REASONS MAYBE MAYBE THEY WERE DEPRESSED AND THEY NEED A MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT MAYBE THEY JUST GOT AWAY FROM THE PATH THAT THEY WERE ON MAYBE THEIR DEFENSE IS SHIFTED A LITTLE BIT WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE THEY GO BACK TO THE PILLARS AND THEY FIGURE IT OUT RIGHT AND NOW THEY'RE IN ACCORD WITH THEMSELVES RIGHT AND THEY'RE LIVING THROUGH AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AND THEY FEEI RIGHT I CAN GO BACK OUT THERE AND I CAN TILL THAT LAND I CAN I CAN GET THE HOE OUT I CAN O I CAN MAKE THE PLOSOM AN TO PUT THE SEEDS IN I'M GOON A NURTUR LIKE I CAN GO DO THAT AND I CAN DO IT EVEN WHAT EVEN THOUGH I WAS DEPRESSED EVEN THOUGH SOMEBODY ASSAULTED ME FIVE MONTHS AGO YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH I LOST MY JOB EVEN THOUGH EVEN THOUGH EVEN THOUGH RIGHT THEY OVERCOME THE EVEN THOSE RIGHT AND THE SENSE OF AGENCY TELLS THEM RIGHT I CAN G DO THAT RIGHT AND THE SENSE OF GRATITUDE NO ONE WHO'S MISERABLE AND AND HEY AND AND NOW IS IR IS IN SUCH AN AWFUL POSITION ABOUT LIFE BECAUSE THEY WERE TTACKED OR LOST HER JOB OR SOMETHING BAD HAPPEN WHATEVER IT MAY BE OR THEY'RE LOST IN CYNICISM THERE'S NO GRATITUDE THERE RIGT IT'S THE GRATITUDE FOR BEING IN LIFE FOR HAVING THE CAPABILITY OF GOING BACK AND AND AND PLANTING SEEDS IN THAT GARDEN THAT'S THE ALLIANCE BETWEEN AGENCY AND GRATITUDE THEN THE PERSON GOES AND DOES THAT RIGHT SO THINK OF WHAT'S GOING ON THERE THEY DO THIS THING THEY FEEL GOOD ABOUT THIS THING THEY CAN HAVE THEY CAN LOOK OUT AT THE GARDEN FEEL SOME PEACE RIGHT FEEL SOME CONTENTMENT O THEM BE THE L LIGHTED BY WHAT THEY DID REMEMBER HOW MUCH THEY LOVED IT BEFORE HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO THEM SO YES THAT GOODNESS COMES THAT GOODNESS SUFFUSES US AND IT RAISES UP THE GENERATIVE DRIVE THAT'S AS RIGHT AS AS GOOD WE BREATHE SOME LIFE INTO IT RIGHT ENOUGH TO GET THAT GARDEN DONE NOW THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IS FURTHER FOLSTERED FORWARD BY THE GOODNESS THE PERSON FEELS SO SO THE EXAMPLE AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PERSON WHOSE LIKE WANTS A GARDEN FEELS TERRIBLE ABOUT THEMSELVES AND THY'RE NOT DOING IT AN THEY FEELS LOUSY EVERY TIME THEY LOOK OUT THE WINDOW AND THERE THEY ARE LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW RIGHT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND HAVING MADE A GARDEN ND LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW ADDED IS A NIGHT AND DAY  DIFFERENCE AND THE THE THE PERSON WHOSE LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AT THE GARDEN THAT THEY BUILD OVERCOMING WHATEVER WAS INSIDE OF THEM BECAUSE THEY THEY WENT AND ADDRESSED IT AND AND PROVED TO THEMSELVES THAT THEY COULDG THAT'S ATL WE'RE AFTER IN LIFE RIGHTEDS WE ALL KNOW THAT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE SOMEBODY LEVITATING AT THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN WRIGHT THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE THE PERSON LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AT TH GARDEN AND THINKING ABOUT WHAT THEY OVERCOME IT OVERCAME TO CREATE THE GARDEN AND SEEING THE GOODNESS OF IT ALL IM GLAD YOU SAID THE WORE CREATING BECAUSE IT SEEMS IT'S ABOUT CREATING THINGS IT REAL TANGIBLE THINGS BUT THAT THE PROCESS TO GET THERE IS EVERY BIT OS IMPORTANT WEE'S NAL MAT'S CREATED WHEN YOU CREATE KNOWLEDGE THAT THAT'S TANGIBLE RIGHT LIKE YOU YOU YOU CRATE KNOWLEDGE MAYBE THAT THAT PERSON LOOKS DOWN THE ROW OF BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS AND HAS THE SAME SENSE OF GOODNESS INSIDE OF THEM THAT YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE RELIC RAD I JUS I JUST WENT AND LEARN SOMETHING AS YOU DESCRIBE THAT I IN THINKING I I CERTAINLY HOPE SO CAUSE FOR ME IT'S IT'S AN INCREDIBLE SENSE OF SATISFACTION AN AN UM ONE THAT I ENJOY SO MUCH THAT I ALMOST TO'T WANT TO LOOK AT IT TOO MUCH CAUST TO ME IT IT SITS IN THIS I'M A RARE DOMAIN OF PERFECT LIKE IT'S JUST IT JUST FEELS SO GOOD AND THAT AM AND THAT I CAN GET BACK THERE IS ER IS VERY COMFORTING TO ME AND THAT'S ALL OF THIS THAT IT FEELS SO OOD THAT'S WHAT ALL THIS IS IT'S THE GENERATIVE DRIVE I IT'S THE IT'S THE GRATITUDE IT'S THE CONTENTMENTS LIKE ALL THAT COMING TOGETHER AND IT'S INTERESTING WE COULD CONTRAST THAT TO DO WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT A REPEATED CYCLE THAT'S NEGATIVE RIGHT THEN YOU'RE NOT FEELING THAT RIGHT SO SO THING BY THE LEARNING THAT CAN COME FROM IT RIGHT THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN ACHIEVE THIS AND FEEL THIS AND BE IN THE STATE IN ONE ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE WHAT CAN YOU LEARN FROM THAT TO BRING TO THE OTHER PLACE IT AND MORE YES THAT'S IMPORTANT IT'S MORE IT IT'S OFTEN STARTING WITH WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE PLACE THIT'S NOT DOING WELL RIGHT LIKE TIS AT WHY THE REPETITION RIGHT SO THIS IS HOW WE WE CAN HAVE WHAT WE'RE SEEKING IN PARTS OF OUR LIVES EVEN IF WE DON'T IN OTHERS BUT IF WE CAN HAVE IT IMPARTS OF OUR LIVES WE CAN HAVE IT IN OTHERS TOO AND WE CAN BECOME ROLE MODELS FOR OURSELVES WE CAN LEARN FROM OURSELVES WE CAN LEARN FROM WHAT BRINGS THE GOOD OUT TO RAISE UP THE THINGS ATABOUT US AND IN OUR LIVES AN OUR THERE YET I OFTEN GET THE QUESTION FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC HOW CAN I STOP OVERTHINKING YOU IGHT I HAVE TO IMAGIN BASED ON THE FACT I GET THAT QUESTION SO OFTEN THAT THERE ARE A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO IM SENSE THEIR OWN GENERATIVE DRIVE WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT THINKINGKCAN BE WONDERFUL IF WE'RE USING THINKING TO LEARN RIGHT TO FIGURE THINGS OUT SO WHEN THINKING IS DOING THAT THINKING IS GREAT BUT A LOT OF THINKING IS JUST IN THE SERVICE OF SOMETHING ELSE I AND A LOT OF THINKING WORKS AGAINST US SO IMAGINE THE PERSON MAKING THE GARDEN I COULD THE PERSON HAS TO THINK ABOUT IT EFEYTHING ABOUT WHAT SEETS TO MAKE THEY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHERE THEY THE TOOLS ARE THEYE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING WHEN THEY'RE PLANTING WHEN THEY'RE WATERING THERE'S A LOT TO DO BUT THE BEAUTY OF IT ISN'T IN THE THINKING RIGHT THE THINKING IS IN THE SERVICE OF WHAT IS GENERATIVE ISO SO THAT'S A DIFFERENT KIND IT'S IT'S JUST THINKING IN THE SERVICE OF SOMETHING BUT A LOT O F OUR THINKING IS THAT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S PLANNING IT'S PROJECTING WE TEND TO GLORIFY THE PLANNING IN THE PROJECTING AND AND IT CAN BE GREAT WHEN WE'RE LEARNING WHEN WE'RE FIGURING THINGS OUT BUT A LOT OF THAT IS IS THERE SO THAT WE CAN DO THE THINGS THAT ARE GOOD FOR US TO DO RIGHT THE PLANNING IN THE PROJECTING ROUND MAKING THE GARDEN WHERE THE POINT OF IT IS THE GARDEN IT'S NOT THE THINKING PART RIGHT WE CAN ALSO USE THINKING AGAINST US SO MUCH THINKING IS REPETITIVE AND  NOT JUST IT NOT JUST UNPRODUCTIVE BUT HARMFUL RT THAT PERSON WHO'S LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AT THE GARDEN MAYBE THINKING I MEAN SOMETIMES ARE JUST PAUSES IN OUR THINKING BUT IN A LOT OF TIMES A PERSON MUST BE THINKING AND AND WHAT OFTEN GOES ON THERE IS JUST REPETITIVE NEGATIVE THINKING IT'S NO GASH I USED TO HAVE A GARDEND REMEMBER WHEN THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL OR NOH REMEMBER BEFORE SUCHONS SUCH A PERSON PASSED AWAY AND THEN WE STOPP MAKING THE GARDEN OR I'LL NEVER GO TO MAKE E GARDEN AGAIN OR GASH IT'S TOO MUCH YOU KNOW IS JUST SOMETHING THIT'S NEGATIVE AND UNPRODUCTIVE MEAN WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO THINK IF THE PERSONS I SH LOOKING OT THE WINDOW AT THE GARDEN RIGHT AND THEY'RE IN THIS SUTO STOCK STATE HERE NOTDEN A GENERATIVE STATE AND THE THINKING BECOMES BECOMES REPETITIVE AND IT FURTHERS ALL THE NEGATIVE RIGHT  U AID THE MORE WE FURTHER THE NEGATIVE THE MERE WE TAKE ITS IS A FORELANE HIGHWAY THAT WE WANT TO ATROTHY LETS I MAKE IT INTO A SICXLANE HIGHWAY YOU KNOW  BUT BUT WE DO THAT WHEN WHEN WE HAVE THIS REPETITIVE THINKING WHICH THEN CAN EVOLVE INTO THE NARRATIVES HOF THINGSTHAT WE SAY TO OURSELVES RIGHT SO SO IF THINKING IS WONDERFUL IT'S WONDERFUL BUT IT CAN LSO JUST OBSERVE SOMETHING ELSE AND IT CAN ALSO BE USED AGAINST US SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING BAUTER DOESN'T GLORIFY THINKING I MEAN IT DOES IF IT'S IN THE SERVICE AT A GENERATIVE DRIVE BUT IT DOESN'T IN IT OUGH ITSELF I THINK MANY PEOPLE IM SET A TIME SAY YO NINE THIRTY  M OR TEN I M WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO BEGIN DOING SOMETHING THET THEY WANT TO DO OR KNOW THEY SHOULD DO THAT'S LITLE BIT CHALLENGING COUD BE EXERCISE COULD BE COGNIVELY DEMANDING WORK AND THEN TEN O'CLOCK ROLLS AROUND THEY SAD CA TEN FIFTEEN AND THEY'RE DISTRACTED BY OFTEN SOCIAL MEDIA TAXTING THESE DAYS I THINK THOSE ORE THE MAIN CULPRITS REALLY IM I DON'T KNOW TOO MANY PEOPLE TO GET DISTRACTED BY EXERCISE AND READING BOOKS SOME DO M AN DOING COMPLEX PUZZLES OR MATH BUT IM THOU SOCIAL MEDIA IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE MENTAL CHEWING GUMM EXCEPT THAT IWOULD ADD TO THAT THAT'S THE KIND OF CHEWING GUM THAT UM REALLY DOES IM SATE THE APPETITE IN A WAY THAT PREVENS YOU FROM EATING NUTRICIOUS FOOD IT UNLESS USED CORRECTLY IM AND THEN PEOPLE FEEL BAD ABOUT THEMSELVES BECAUSE THE WHOLE MORNING WENT BY ANNOUNCE NOON THEN THEY REQUIRE SOME FOOD LIKE ANY AV PERSON  EEN THEY MIGHT MEEL NAP FOR THE PROPRANDIAL DIP AND ENERGY AND THEN THE AFTERNOON AND AND THEN IT GOES ON AND ON IMAY I I HEAR THIS ALL THE TIME I'VE EXPERIENCED THIS BEFORE SOM I'M NOT I MUNE TO THIS MYSELF THAT'S WHY I TRYING CAPTURE THAT EARLY WAVE OF ENERGY WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE A DRANAL IN NOR RANL AN A SOME COMMINATION THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE THINKING AND IT'S POTENTIAL RELATIONSHIP TO GENERATIVE DRIVE IT SEEMS TO ME IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE CAPTURE THOSE MOMENTS OF I BUT POTENTIAL CREATION HOW HOWEVER SMALL THE ACTION MIGHT BE TO REMIND OURSELVES THAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF MOVING THINGS FROM POINAY TO POINT BE BECAUSE IN THE DESCRIPTION I JUST GAVE OF THE PERSON THAT LET'S THE MORNING ESCAPE THERE'S THERE'S REALLY UM NO EXTERNAL BARRIER EXCEPT THESE DISTRACTIONS PUT DIFFERENTLY ALL THE TOOLS EXIST WITHIN MOST ALL OF US TO BE ABLE TO CREATE WHAT WE WANTS GREAT OR AT LEAST TO CREATE SOMETHING FRANKLY TH UM AND YET MANY MANY PEOPLE JUST DON'T FULFILL THAT UM THAT RIGHT THAT THEY WERE AND THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN GIVEN RIGHT SO LET'S THINK THINK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON THERE SO SO THE PRESON DUNG AN EXERCISE AT TEN O'CLOCK IGHT NOW I PUSH IT BACK THE TEN FIFTEEN AND Y DO SOMETHING ON SOCIA MERE THEY PUSH IT BACK TO TEN THIRTY IT'LL BE OCA I'LL GET IT ALL IN WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THE'RE THE'RE ENGAGING I IS UNHEALTHY DEFENCE MECHANISMS RIGHT SO IF WE GO BACK TO THE THE PILLARS RIGHT THE THE STRUCTURE OF SELF THE FUNCTION OF SELF THERE MAY BE OTHER REASONS FOR IT PULICIOUS IDENTIFY THE UNHEALTHY DEFENCES OF AVOIDANCE AND RATIONALIZATION RIGHT AND THEN THERE'S NO THINKING GOING ON ABOUT THAT RIGHT IJOUST UNCONSCIOUS PROCESSES AND YOU KICK IT DOWN YOU KNAY YOU KICK GET DOWN THE CLOCK FIFTEEN MINUTES RIGHT THE'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT IT THINKING THEN IS SUBSERVING SOMETHING DIFFERENT RIGHT THINKING IS SUBSERVING THE AVOIDANCE IF I'M GONG TO GO LOOK ON SOMETHING OF READ A COUPLE THINGS REPLY YOU KNOW I'M THINKING ON PLANNING RIGHT I GOT TO GET THE MAYE GOT TO GET THE PHONE OUT I GOT A TAT YOU KNOW MY COATING TO IT I GOT T GO TO A CERTAIN BETSI LOOKING WE'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT I THINK ABOUT WHAT I'M GOING TO WRIHT THAT BUT THE THINKING IS ALL IN THE SERVICE OF THE UNHEALTHY DEFENCES RIGHT SO THEN BY UNDERSTANDING OURSELVES BETTER WE CAN WE CAN BRING THAT RIGHT TO A HEALTHIER PLACE HOW BY ABACCHON USING THINKING FOR WHAT HELPS US RIGHT SO LET'S THINK OF LIKE WHAT OOKING WHAT'S GOING LET'S SAY IF YOU'RE DOING THAT OOKI WHAT'S GOING ON WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT RIGHT SO SO DO YOU YOU REALLY WANT TO EXERCISE RIGHT BUT LIKE IS NOT EASY TO EXERCISE AND SOMETHING'S MIGH JUST PROBLEM SOVING ARE YOU DOING A THINK YOU LIKE MAYBE SOMETHING YOU LIKE MORE THER'S LOWER BARRIER ET CETERA BUT LET'S SAY WE'RE JUST WORKING WITHIN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL RIGHT THEN YOU CAN COME AT THAT A COUPLE OF WAYS LIKE I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT THING THAT THINGS HARD RIGHT I MEAN I THINK THAT ABOUT THINGS IN MY LIFE SOMETIMES AND IT ALWAYS MAKES ME HAP AND MAKES ME WEIGHTY AND UNHAPPY RIGHT I MAY AS WELL PUT TWENTY POUND WEIGHTS ON EITHER SIDE OF ME RIGHT A MAN I CAN LOOK AT IT THAT WAY RIGHT OR THERE' HE DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT IT THAT ACTUALLY FIT'S MUCH BETTER WHICH IS LIKE I'M NOT DAUNTED BY DOING DIFFICULT THINGS AND I CAN GET OUT THERE AND AND APPLY MYSELF AND YOU KNOW ANT I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT WHEN I DO DIFFICULT THINGS IS LIKE PART OF MY IDENTITY RIGHT AS LIKE PART OF HOW I SEE MYSELF SO RIGHT I' GOING TO GO DO THIS THING AND I GOAG TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT T AND AND ISN'T IT AMAZING THAT I GET TO DO IT RIGHT IK ILL CARRI AM UM ALIVE UM HEALTHY RIGHT I CAN GO DO THE THING I WUT MY HEALTH IS IS GOOD BUT I WANT TO MAKE IT BETTER RIGHT BY WORKING OUT OR I'M AT LEAST ALIVE AND IF IT LOSE A LITTLE BIT OF WAGHT I'LL FEEL HEALTHIER LIKE A COME ON THIS IS GOOD RIGHT AND THEN I'LL FEEL DIFFERENT ABOUT THAT RIGHT AND AND LIKE THE TRUTH I'S ONT OR THE OTHERS LIKE  BOTH CAN BE TRUE KNOW WHAT WILL BE TRUE IS WHAT YOU CHOOSE RIGHT AND IF YOU CHOOSE THE NEGATIVE THEN YES YOU T UNHEALTHY DEFENCE IS PERPETUATAND EVEN IF YOU GET YOURSELF TO DO IT TODAY IT'S HARDER TO DO IT TOMORROW THAT'S WHY SOMETIMES I'LL SAY TO A PERSON IKE JUST TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND DECIDE IF YOU WANT TO DO IT OR NOT IF YOU DON'T WANTO EXERCISE JUST DECIDE YOU DON'T RIGHT AND AND THEN NO GAY THERE'S A TRADE ALL FOR EVERYTHING MAY BE ROCEY WITH THE TRADE OFF RIGHT BUT WHAT AM I TRYING TO DO THERE RIGHT IS IS BRING TO CONSCIOUSNESS THA THAT PERSON IS MAKING A CHOICE RIGHT DO YOU WANT TO DO IT IF YOU WANT TO DO IT IF YOU WANT TO DO IT IT'S GREAT TO JUST DO IT RIGHT AND IF YOU DON'T IT'S IS GREAT TO NOT DO IT AND LEAST YOU'RE BEING HONEST AND CLEAR WITH YOURSELF AND YOU'RE NOT WASTING ALL THAT TIME WHEN YOU KEEP KICKING IT FIFTEEN MINUTES DOWN THE YOU KNO DOWN THE CLOCK YOU KNOW UNTILL IT'S TOO LATE DOES DOES THAT  MAKE SENSESS I THINK HOW THE STRUCTURE HERE REALLY DOES IT WORKS BECAUSE IT'S IT'S PULLING TOGETHER WHAT WE KNOW FROM THE BIOLOGY TO THE PSYCHOLOGY IV LIKE HOW TO UNDERSTAND OURSELVES AND HOW TO UNDERSTAND WHEN THINGS AREN'T THE WAY WE WANT THEM TO BE SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THEM THE WAY WE WANT THEM TO BE IS NOT MAGIC IT'S IT'S FOLLOWING THE SORT OF MATHEMATICAL ASPECTS OF YOU DON'T GOING TO THE FACTORS ASSESSING THEM MAKING CHANGES AND AND THEN OF COURSE WE SEE THE OUTCOME WE WANT TO SAY THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE IT DOES MAKE SENSE AND APPRECIATE IT BECAUSE THINK ULTIMATELY IT SEEMS TO RACTIV ACTO ACTIONS TO VERBS TO BRING US TO THESE FEELING STATES THAT YOU  I THINK HARD WHAT PEOPLE ARE SEEKING YOU KNOW PECE CONTENTMENT DELIGHT YOU KNOW THROUGH AGENCY GRATITUDE AS ACTIVE TERMS RIGHT LETHERS YES NOW I THINK  THE ARE UNIVERSAL DESIRES AND I CAN NEAVE PROVIDING THIS IM WONDERFUL ROAD MAP FOR PEOPLE TO ARRIVE THERE THINK YOU I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT SOME OF THE UNDERE PINNINGS OF GENERATIVE DRIVE IN PARTICULAR THIS I NOTION OF AGGRESSIVE DRIVE IM I'VE KNOWN  PEOPLE THAT SEEM TO HAVE A LOT OF THIS T YUS AVE A LOT TO GET UP AND GO OR A LOT OF DRIVE TO CREATE IN THE WORLD ARE TO FIGURE THINGS OUT IM THEY OFTEN DO CREATE GREAT LIVES FOR THEMSELVES AND IN WORK IN RELATIONSHIP ET CETERA I'VE ALSO OBSERVED THAT THESE PEOPLE OFTEN DON'T HAVE THE BEST RELATIONSHIP TO THEMSELVES OR THAT THEY RUN UP AGAINST IM BEARERS ARE FRANKLY SOMETIMES STRAIGHT IN TO BRICK WALLS I'M IN CERTAIN DOMAINS OF THEIR LIFE PERHAPS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING TOO MUCH OF THIS GENERATIVE OR AGGRESSIVE DRIVE AND AT THE SAME TIME I KNOW THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD MANY THAT HAVE OF A WHAT SEEMS TO BE A LOW GENERATIVE DRIVE I I DON'T NOW IF THAT'S THE CASE OR NOT BUT IM THAT THEY IM THEY SEEM T HAVE A HARD TIME ENGAGING LIKE  IN DOING THINGS AND AND OFTEN YOU GET THE IMPRESSION THA THEY SOME WAT ER COMPLETELY GIVEN UP THETS JUST LIKE LIFE IS JUST TOO HARD OR AM SOMETIMES IT'S EVEN MORE SUBTLE LIKE I KNOW SOME ONE WHO THAT THEY LIKE THEIR JOB BUT THEY IVE COME TO THE PLACE THAT IM YOU KNOW LIKE IT'S JUST WORK LIKE IT'S A PACHACK AND TAND THAT MIGHT BE ENOUGH BUT THEY 'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT IT SO I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH THEY AREN'T ABLE TO SLOT THEIR WORK INTO ONE DOMAIN AND AN JUST FOCUS ON THE OTHER AASPECTS OF THEIR LIFE THAT ARE GOING WELL IT DOESN'T COMPENSATE FOR THEM TO THINK ABOUT THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE LIFE THAT IS SO M IS THERE CONTINUUM OF GENERATIVE DRIVES THAT EXIST IN US ARE THESE INTRINSIC I I REALIZE THERE ARE NEAR INFINITE NUMBER OF CONDITIONS THAT I'M COULD GIVE RISE TO ONE OR TH E OTHER BE HARD WIRED COULD BE NATURE COULD BE NURTURE BUT WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AN ON I WON'T TO SAY AROUSAL OR ON A POTENTIAL FOR AROUSAL AND AGGRESSIVE DRIVE AND O AND THESE THINGS THAT WERE SEEKING E TO THE TOO CARE I A I LOIKE TO START LIKE THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF THE DRIVES RIGHT SO THAT THE THEORY OF DRIVES CAME ABOUT WHEN WHEN PEOPLE WERE OBSERVING VERY CLOSELY  HUMAN BEINGS AND HUMAN BEHAVIOUR INDIVIDUALS SOCIETYES CULTURES RIT AND AND IDENTIFYING THAT HTHAT THAT YOU CAN BOIL A LOT OF THINGS DOWN TO TO A DRIVE THAT WE  CALL AGGRESSIVE RIGHT IS SOMETHING TO I IMPOSE MYSELF OUT THERE ON THE WORLD AROUND ME RIGHT EXPLAINS A LOT OF WHAT PEOPLE DO RIGHT AND THEN THE OTHER IDENTIFIED DRIVE WAS PLEASURE RIG HO WAS OALWAYS SO ENJOYMENT EVEN RELIEF OF UNPLEASANTNESS RIGHT THAT THAT THE THILLSIKE YOU CAN DESCRIBE A LOT OF HUMAN BEHAVIOUR AND AND THAT TO UNDERSTAND LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF US THAT MEANS THAT WERE HERE RIGHT YOU SEE THAT THROUGH THE LENS OF AGGRESSIVE AND PLEASURE DRIVES AND LIKE THAT'S THE ANSWER TO IT TO HOW WE SURVIVE BUT I THINK THAT IS NOT THE ANSWER TO IT THAT IF IT WERE JUST AGGRESSIVE DRIVES AND PLEASURE DRIVES THERE'S NOT A VALUE SYSTEM AROUND THAT LIKE A NO SOMEBODY WHO'S VERY INDUSTRIOUS CAN BUILD OR DESTROY RIGHT AND WE SEE THIS IN HISTORICAL FIGURES LIKE BEING VERY INTELLIGENT AND VERY INDUSTRIOUSNESS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER YOUR BUILDING OR DESTROYING RIGHT SO IF IT WERE JUST AN AGGRESSIVE DRIVE AND A PLEASURE DRIVE THN WE WOULDN' BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION RIGHT BECAUSE THE SPECIES WOULD HAVE WOULD NOT HAVE SURVIVE RIT SO IF YOU BELIEVE THAT AND I BELIEVE THAT THEN YOU LOOK FOR SOMETHING ELSE YUSESEAN MAYBE WE LOOKED AND WE FOUND TWO THINGS WHEN THEIR MORE THINGS RIGHT AND THEN WE START THINKING ABOUT LEARNING FOR LEARNING SAKE AUCHRUISM THINGS THAT ARE NOT EXPLAINED RIGHT UNLESS THERE'S A SELF REFERENTIAL WE FEEL GOOD DOING SOMETHING FOR SOME ONE ELSE OR THEREFORE IT SELFISH LIKE THOSE A LOT OF GIRATIONS AROUND THAT IF YOU REALLY OBSERVE HUMANS YOU DOU SEE AUTHUA TH OUCHRUSM YOU SEE LEARNING FOR LEARNINGS SAK YOU SEE PEOPLE BEING BENIN WHEN EVERYTHING ABOUT A SITUATION WOULD SAY THAT THEY COULD WOUD OR SHOULD UNDER SOCIETY'S RULES NOT BE BENIGN RIGHT AND THEN WE START TO SEE THAT THERE IS ANOTHER DRIVE THAT HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT WE'RE HERE YET AGGRESSION PLEASURE AND GENERATIVENESS REGENERATIVE DRIVE THE DRIVE TO MAKE THINGS BETTER THAT'S WHIGT WE BUILD MORE THAN WE DESTROY WE DESTROY A LOT RIGHT BUT WE BUILD MORE THAN WE DESTROY OTHERWISE WE WOULDN'T HAVE CLOSE ON OUR BACKS LET ALONE HAVE THE THE TECHNOLOGY TO SIT HERE AND TO BE ABLE TO DO THESS SO IT'S THE GENERATIVE DRIVE THAT THAT IS MOST REALIZED IN THE HEALTHY PERSON RIGHT AND THE HEALTHY PERSON HAS THE STRONG GENERATIVE DRIVE NOW AS YOU SAID THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS AND THISTOOD WHAT YOU WERE ASKING ABOUT THEIR PROBABLY THER NATURAL LEVELS OF AGGRESSION OR PLEASURE SEEKING ORE GENERATIVENESS THAT DIFFER ACROSS PEOPLE RIGHT AS WE'RE PRODUCT OF NOR THE COMPLEXITY OF ARE GENETICS ANDUO ALL THE COMPLEXITIES OF NATURE AND NURTURE SO WE'RE GOING TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE WHERE SOME OF US HAVE MORE SOME OF US HAVE LESS RIGHT THTHE THE THE CONCLUSION THAT AS FOR ALL OF US THE GENERATIVE DRIVE BEING AT THE HELM IS WHAT WHAT LEADS US TO BE T TO LIVE GOOD LIVES RIGHT TO LIVE TO THE THINGSTHAT WE ASPIRE TO THE PEACE AND CONTENTMENT RIGHT SO WE WANT THE GENERATIVE DRIVE TO RULE THE DAY RIGHT WHETHER A PERSON IS STUDYING NARROW SCIENCE OR GROWING GARDENS RIGHTLY THE IMPORTANCE IS ABOUT BEING GENERATIVE THEN THEN AGGRESSION AND PLEASURE CAN SUBSERVE THE GENERATIVE DRIVE RIGHT AND THEN THE QUESTION OUR ASK ING I I THINK WHICH IS WWHAT IF THERE'S TOO MUCH AGGRESSION TOO LITTLE AGGRESSION RIGHT WERE TOO MUCH PLEASURE SEEKING TOO LITTLE PLEASURE SEEKING THAT'S WHEN WE WE CAN SEE PROBLEMS RIGHT AND THE PROBLEMS AND LEAD US BACK TO THE PILLARS TO FIGURE OUT THE PROBLEMS SO TOO MUCH AGGRESSION ULTIMATELY BECOMES ENVY RIGHT TOO MUCH AGGRESSION MEANS I I WANT I I'M ON IMPOSE MYSELF ON ON THE WORLD AROUND ME MORE THAN I CAN MORE THAN IS REASONABLE MORE THAN  CAN DO WITHOUT IMPINGING UPON OTHERS RIGHT THAT WHAT YOU END UP DOING IS TAKING FROM OTHERS RIGHT TOO MUCH AGGRESSION BECOMES DESTRUCTIVE RIGHT MAYBE A PERSON DESTROYS TEAR SOMETHING DOWN RIGHT TAKES FROM OTHERS I SAYS THAT THE THE NASTY COMMENT WHEN IT WASN'T NECESSARY AND EVERYONE FEELS BAD RIGHT TH THERE'S THAT TOO MUCH AGGRESSION STAR IT BECOMES ENVY RIGHT AND ENVY IS DESTRUCTIVE IHT THE SAME THING WITH TOO MUCH PLEASURE SEEKING IF I SAY  KA I WAT YOU KNOW I WANT MY FAIR SHARE OF PLEASURE YOU KNOW RELIEF OF DESTRESS NALLTAT BUT IF I STA IF I RELY ON THAT TOO MUCH RIGHT RENOU NCSTHEAD OF AGGRESSION ECLIPSING THE GENERATIVE DRIVE NOUNCE PLEASURE ECLIPSING THE GENERATE DRI THEN AN WANT MORE PLEASURE AND MORE PLEASURE AND MORE PLEASURE AND HOW LONG BEFORE I WANT YOUR PLEASURE RIGHT SO SO THAT IT'S NOT HEALTHY RIGHT WHAT I BECOMES IS ENVIOUS RIGHT IT BECOMES DESTRUCTIVE BECAUSE NOW THEN I BECOME COVETOUS OF YOUR PLEASURE ORE IF I CAN'T GET IT BUT I COULD BRING YOU DOWN THAN A'LL FEEL BETTER ABOUT MYSELF THAT'S ENVY RIGHT SO TOO MUCH AGGRESSION ECLIPSING THE GENERATIVE DRIVE TOO MUCH OF THE OF PLEASURE SEEKING TO PLEASURE DRIVE ECLIPSING THE GENERATIVE DRIVE AND WE END UP IN PLACES OF ENVY AND ENVY IS DESTRUCTIVE AND NOW WERE IN TROUBLE I'VE NEVER THOUGHT BEFORE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BE TWEEN AGGRESSION PLEASURE AND ENVY BUT AS YOURE DESCRIBING IT I COMES TO MINE DE MUVE AMERICAN PSYCHO WERE CHRISTIAN BAL PLACE THIS UM E PISICALLY A AD EASY YUPPY IN THE THE WORKING IN FINANCE IN NEW YORK AND EM AND FOR ANY ONE THAT SEEN IT IT'S A CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A VIOLENT PARODY OF OF EIGHTY'S YUPPY CULTURE AND IT'S ITS NARTO DEHOMEDY IS THIS GOING TO BEYETS AS DARK A COMINY ES IT CONVEAND AND DON'T LET YOUR YOUNG CHILDREN WATCH HIT BECAUSE HE'S VERY GRUESOME AND HA N LIKE VERY SEXUAL AND BUT THE THE THE AGGRESSIVE FEATURES WITHIN THE CHARACTER THAT BAIL PLAYS AM ARE IMMEDIATELY APPARENT IN THE MOVI LIKE YOUN O VIOLENT AGGRESSION SEXUAL AGGRESSION AM SEEKING MONEY SEEKING WEALTH ALL THE TIME AT A ANARCICISM TO AN OBSESSION WITH LIKE EVERYTHING FROM HIS SKINCARE ROUTRING TO A HIS EIGHT PACK ABS AND LIKE IT'S IT'S RIDICULOUS BUT UM BUT ALSO AN INTERESTING WINDOW INTO SOME MILDER FORMS OF THOSE FEATURES THAT STILL EXIST IN MANY PEOPLE TO DAY RIGHT A BUT THE ENV COMPONENT STARTS TO REVEAL ITSELF LOBIT LATER INTO THE MOVI WHERE UM THE SCENE I RECALLS ONE AROUND WHERE SOE ONE HANDSOME OF BUSINESS CARD AND THEN YOU HEAR THE NARRATIVE IN HIS OWN MIND ABOUT HOW MUCH NICE SER THAT GUIS BUSINESS CARD THAS THAN HIS AND HOW HE HATES HIM SO MUCH HANDS O N A GUY YES IT IN VERY VIOLEN SOTISTIC FASHION THAT'S AN RESSIN O  GENR ESRI  RIGHT AND SO AND THE WHOLE MOVY IS ABOUT A THIS ONE A ASPECT OF CULTURE AT THAT TIMES ABILITY TO IMPOSE THEIR WILL ON EVERY EVERY ONE AT AT THEIR WHIM YOU KNOW BASILY BELL JUST DOES WHATEVER THE HELL E WANTS AT ANY POINT GOES RETURN VIDIOTAPES IN BETWEEN AND YOU KNOW AND AND THERE'S SO MUCH WOVEN INTO IT AND A THAT IS RELEVANT AD SO MUCH THAT SWOVEN INTO IT THAT'S JUST PURELY FOR PEOPLES THE CONTISICAN ENTERTAINMENT A A BUT THAT BELIEVE HIS BREATBREN EASTERN ELS THAT WROTE THAT A YU IS TAPPING INTO THE THE AGGRESSION COMPONENT THE PLEASURE COMPONENT BUT THE ENVY COMPONENT IS REALLY WHAT RESONATES AS AS YOU COME TO THE END OF THE MOVI IS LIKE THERE'S NO SATISFYING THIS GUY HE COULD KILL ER OR SLEEP WITH AS MANY PEOPLE AS HE WANTS IN THE MOVI AM AND HE CAN HAVE AS MUCH WEALTH AS HE WANTS HE CAN  HAVE ENTIRE BUILDINGS IF OUT TO THINK HE'S LIVING IN AN ENTIRE BUILDING AT SOME POINT HE TAKES OVER PEOPLE'S APARTMENTS AFTER HE KILLS THEM IT'S IT'S IT'S WILD AND DISGUSTING AM BUT IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH ENVY IS WOVEN IN TO ABSOLUTE AGGRESSION IN PLEASURE SEEKING AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT HAD AREALLY SUNK IN FOR ME UNTIL YOU DESCRIBE IT NOW AM BECAUSE I THINK FOR MOST PEOPLE  IMAGINEOKET WHEN SOMEBODY HAS EX NUMBER OF MILLIONS OR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT THEY'LL REACH THIS PLACE OF PEACE CONTENTMENTS AND DELIGHT RIGHT THEY'LL HAVE ENOUGH A AND IN THE MOVY WALL STREET THERE'S THAT ONE SEENG WHERE SO ONE SAYS YOU NOW WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER LIKE AT WHAT POINT IS ENOUGH THE I SAYS MORE THAT'S SAYS ALL SORTS OF THINGS ABOUT THE DOPOMANERGIC SYSTEM OF WARD SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN ET CETERA BUT THINK IT SAYS A LOT MORE ABOUT ENVY IDSOAND JUST WHAT AND WHAT A PIT OF DESPAIRE ENVY IS FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED RIGHT RIGHT THE ENVY MAY NOT BE THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL BUT ENVY PLUS NATURAL DISASTERS MAYBE SO MUCH EVIL AND DESTRUCTION ARISES FROM ENVY AND IT MAY BE THAT IT'S AT THE ROOT OF ALL OF IT AND WE SO UNDERAPPRECIATE THAT  WE SO UNTERPICIATE WHY PEOPLE ARE DESTRUCTIVE  WHICH IS WHY THE ROOTS AREN'T ALWAYS IN TRAMA BUT BUT A SIGNIFICANT  I ASPECT OF OF WARE ENVY ARISES FROM CAN OFTENBE TROMA CREATING A SENSE OF GUILT AND SHAME AND VONERABILITY BUT BUT WHEREVER A PERSON MAY COME BY IT AND IT'S A LARGER DISCUSSION OF WHO ENVY AND WHERE MAY COME FROM IS IT DRIVES DESTRUCTION AND IF THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE IS GREATER THAN THE GENERATIVE DRIVE OR IF THE PLEASURE DRIVE IS GREATER THAN THE GENERATIVE DRIVE OR IF BOTH ARE GREATER THAN THE GENERATIVE DRIVE IT WILL DRIVE DESTRUCTION AND THAT DESTRUCTION THE VAST MAJORITY OF TIMES IF YOU LOOK DEEP ENOUGH YOU FIN ND AT ITS ROOTS ENVY THAT ENVY MAY ARISE FROM GUILT AND SHAME WITHIN THE PERSON BUT AS SOON AS IT BECOMES ABOUT ANOTHER RIGHT I FEEL GUILT AND SHAME AN IN ADEQUACY INSIDE OF ME BUT THEN I FEEL ENVY OF THOSE AROUND ME THEY DRIVES THE VAST MAJORITY OF DESTRUCTION DO YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING WHEN WE SEE THESE A SADLY A EVER MORE FREQUENT EXAMPLES OF A ACTIVE SHOOTERS AND SCHOOL SHOOTINGS THINGS THAT SORT YES THERE ARE THERE OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIFE AND THAT PERSON DOESN'T FEEL THAT THEY DO SO THEY WANT TO GO AND TAKE IT AWAY FROM THEM THAT'S WHYIS AS LONG AS WE HAVE HUMAN TRIBULATION AND A LOT OF GUNS TI IS  CING T HAPPEN ITS IT'S IT'S A LOGICAL CONCLUSION OF ENOUGH PEOPLE BEING IN PLACES OF DESPAIR AND HOW ENVY CAN BECULTIVATED WITHIN US AND THEN ULTIMATELY HOW IT BLINDS PEOPLE IT CREATES SUCH A DESIRE FOR DESTRUCTION THA THEN PEOPLE WILL TAKE LIFE AWAY FROM OTHERS AND OFTEN IF PEOPLL SOMETIMES TAKE THEIR OWN LIFE WHICH WHICH I THINK REALLY BRINGS TO THE FOREFRONT THA THAT THAT PRISONERS IT FEEL THAT THEY HAVE A LIFE CERTAINLY NOT A LIFE WORTH PRESERVING SO THERE THEN GOING TO TAKE THE LIVES OF OTHERS AND I THINK WEAR SEEING THAT IS AS STARC A PORTRAIT OF WHERE ENVY CAN LEAD I THINK AS WE CAN FIND AL THE ONE PERSON BASIS WEWECAN G WE CAN LOOK AT WARS IN THEIR DESTRUCTION ON A SOCITAL BASIS BUT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THE ULTIMATE IN UNDERSTANDING WHERE ENVY CAN DRIVE A PERSON WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM WHEN AGGRESSION AND O PLEASURE SEEKING AR TOO LOW THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM IS DEMORALIZATION SO IS I MAGINE VERY VERY LOW AGGRESSION SO LOW SELF ASSERTION AND LOW AGENCY I THAT THERE THERE COMES A PLACE WHERE THAT THE PERSON IS NOT THEN IMPOSING THEMSELVES OR BELIEVING THAT THEY CAN IN IN IN MUCH OF ANY WAY ON THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND THAT CREATES A SENSE OF ISOLATION UNDERSTANDABLY RIGHT A SENSE OF POWERLESSNESS AND VUNERABILITY AND ISOLATION AND THAT THEN BECOMES DEMORALIZING WHICH IS NOT THE SAME AS DEPRESSION MINDIAD A WENOW DEPRESSION IS A  IS THERE'S A NEURO CHEMICAL AND BALANCE RIGHT WHETHER THAT AND BALANCE CAME PURELY BIOLOGICALLY OR OR CAME PSYCHOLOGICALLY OR BECAUSE OF EXTERNAL EVENTS THERE'S A NEUR CHEMICAL AND BALANCE NO HERE WE'RE NOT TALKING BOUT AN ILLNESS STATE AS IDENTIFIED BY MODERN PSYCHIATRY THORE'S NOT A NUMBER IN THE IN THE BOOK OF DIAGNOSES THAT GOES ALONG WITH WITH BEING DEMORALIZED  BUT WHY BECAUSE IT'S A STATE THAT HUMANS CAN BE IN AND TOO LOW OF AN AGGRESSIVE DRIVE I AND ALL THE THINGS THAT COME OF THAT IITS ISOLATING IN ITS DEMORALIZING THE SAME WITH TOO LOW OF A OF  PLEASURE DRIVE SO EXAMPLE THAT MAY BE RELATABLE IT IS IM TO SOME PEOPLE IS KNOWING SOME ONE WHOWHO HAS AD A COUPLE OF REALLY BAD BREAK UPS AND AND THENSE AS I'M NOT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M DONE WITH THAT ITIS NO MORE ROMANCE O CAN BE SINGLE RAG AND ANDYE KNOW LIKE THAT PERSON HAS A DRIVIN THEM LIKE OTHERE AN INTERCONNECTED PERSON LIKE THEY THEY WANT ROMANCE THEY THESE RE THINGS THEARE IMPORTANT TO THEM IT THEY THEY MAKE A DECISION I'M NOT ANGT HAVE THAT IN MY IN MY LIFE WHAT WHAT WOULD BE CALLED IN SOME PSYCHODYNAMIC SENSES INVITING DEATH INTO LIFE A LITTLE BIT OF DEATH BY BY SWEARING OFF SOMETHING THAT THAT THE PERSON AS A DRIVE TOWARDS RIGT THE PLEASURE DRIVE OF COMPANIONSHIP AND OF ROMANCE  THAT THAT THEN BECOMES DEMORALIZING AS WELL SO SURE THOSE THINGS DEMORALIZATION CAN PREDISPOSE TO DEPRESSION BUT DEMORALIZATION IS A THING IN AND OF ITSELF WHERE THEN THERE'S A SENSE OF HOPELESS NESSERS A SENSE OF O GI  THE GOODNESS THAN IS IN ICCESSIBLE ANY MORE IN THAT'S THE OTHER SIDE OF ENVY CAN LOW LEVELS OF AGGRESSION AND THE RESULTING DEMORALIZATION BE COUPLED WITH HIGH LEVELS OF PLEA SURE SEEKING SO I'M THINKING ABOUT THE PERSON THAT UM  IS VERY OVER WEIGHT CLEARLY U HEADED FOR HEALTH ISSUES IF THEY DON'T ALREADY HAVE THEM AND O PERHAPS WOULD LIKE TO REMOVE THAT WEIGHT WOULD LIKE TO FEEL MORE VIGOROUS DOESN'T WANT TIHT TO DIABETIES AND AN EARLY DEATH BUT AT' SOME LEVEL THEY'E GIVEN UP BUT BECAUSE THE THE PLEASURE OF EATING IS SOMETHING THEY REALLY ENJOY THAT THEY REALLY LOVE IT AND YET IT HAS A COMPONENT TO IT IN THEIR LIFE WHERE THEY EITHERSELVE SOOTHED WITH IT OR THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO HIT BASELINE LEVELS OF SATISFACTION WITH IT AND AND IM THEY ALLOW THEMSELVES TO IS A EFFECTUVELY BE SEDENTARY AND AND THEN THE OTHER SORTS OF TROUBLE START TO SHOW UP YOU KNOW SLEEP APENEOUGH FROM CARRYING EXCESSIVE WEIGHT AND THEN THEY'RE FEELING TIRED DURING THE DAY AND THEN WHO CAN EXERCISE WHEN THEY'RETOO TIRED WHEN YOU GAT TO WORK AND MAINTAIN ANOTHER LIFE DEMANDS AND YOUVE CONE TO SEE WHERE THIS COULD RISE AND AN MAKES PERFECT SENSE SHAM CAN ALSO SEE WHERE UM IF THERE WERE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE AGGRESSION IT CULD ALL BE TURNED ROUND BUT THEY DON'T HAVE IT SO IS THE SCENARIO DESCRIBED SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE SEEM CLINICALLY I CERTAINLY OBSERVE IT AN MY NONCLINICAL STANDS OUT THERE IN THE WORLD A LOT IWELL I THINK THE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU'RE POINTING OUT IS THAT AGGRESSION AND PLEASURE ON THE HIGH AND RIGHT WE WE KNOW CAN TRUMP THE GENERATIVE DRIVE RIGHT BUT THAT THIS CAN ALSO HAPPEN ON THE LOW END RIGHT SO YOU'RE DESCRIBING A SITUATIENS AS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE IVUT IT'S NOT UNCOMMON IN THE WORLD AROUND US SO THE AGGRESSION ME THE FUEL TO PUT ONESELF OUT THERE IN THE WORLD RIGHT TO UTILIZE THE SENSE OF AGENCY RIGHT SO THIS IN TOBY PERSON OS LOW AGENCY RIGHT THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE IT HAS AS LITTLE FUEL THAN TO GIVE THE SENSE OF AGENCY ITS FURTHER SQUELCH BY NEGAT BY YOU NEGATIVE SENSE IFSELF AND NEGATIVE SELF TALK NOW YOU FIND WHERE THEY THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE IS IS TOO LOW AND TOO LOW CAN ALSO TRUMP THE GENERATIVE DRIVE RIGHT BECAUSE IN THAT PERSON CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES A GENERATIVE DRIVE WOULD SAY THEREIS A LOT OF LIFE TO LIVE IN THERE CAN BE GREAT THINGS IN LIFE AND TAKE BETTER CARE OF YOURSELF AND BY THE WAYOR LIKE PEOPLE THAT YOU LOVE ND PEOPLE THAT LOVE YOU OR OR IF NOT HERE'S AN ANIMAL REGARDIN YOU LOVE I SO SO THE GENERATVE DRIVES IS IS SAYING THAT RIGHT BUT IT'S NOT WINNING THE DAY BECAUSE THE AGGRESSION OR UKNO GRESSION IS ONE WORD WE CAND PUT TO THAT DRIVE YOU COULD CALL IT AN ASSERTION DRIVE YOU KNOW IT WE CALL IT AN AGENCY DRI BUT THAT'S WE KNO ER USING AGENCY IN A DIFFERENT WAY BUT THAT THING IS TOO LOW SO IT WINS OUT OVER THE GENERATIVE DRIVE AND THEN IN THE EXAMPLE YOU GAVE IT'S NOT SURPRISING I THAT THE PLEASURE  DRIVE GOES THE OTHER WAY MAYBE THERE'S A PREDISPOSITION TO THAT GENETICALLY MAYBE IT'S JUST REENFORCED BECAUSE A PERSON IN THAT PLACE COULD SAY WELL THINK OF WAT WHAT THIS THE THE SELF CONCEPTION WOULD BE RIGHT I'M IN THIS TERRIBLE PLACE IM IT YOUOW ME THEM A TERRIBLE PERSON I CAN'T MAKE MYSELF BATTER OR I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO GET BETTER NO ONE CARES ABOUT ME I CAN'T MAKE ANYTHING RIGHT SO SO THEREFORE LIKE I DON'T I DON'T MATTER A I'S NO REASON TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELVE SO WHY WOULD I NOT DO IF I EAT THAT ONE THING THAT I ENJOY AND IT GIVES ME PLEASURE EVEN IT GAS A PLEASURE FOR TWO MINUTES THAN I'LL EAT ANOTHER ONE LIKE IN SENSE SO WHAT WOKAUSE I'M I DON'T FEEL IT ON WORTH PRESERVING OR THAT I CAN PRESERVE MYSELF RIHT THERE'S A NIHIL LISTEN TO IT THAT THEN KUN IN MAKES IT MAKE SENSE TO OVER INDULGE THE PLEASURE DRIVE WHETHER IT'S A WHETHER IT'S BIOLOGICALLY PREDISPOSE O ONE IS JUST A RIVING THERE BUT THE THE REASON ALL THAT IS BAD IT'S BECAUSE THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE IS TOO LOW AND EFFACTIT'S LOW ENOUGH THAT IT'S OUTWEITING THE GENERATIVE DRVE TEN THE PLEASURE DRIVES GEN TO COME INTO WE KNOW ONE PLACE OR ANOTHER IF IT'S ALSO REALLY LOW THE PERSON DOES NOT MUCH OF ANYTHING AND WASTES A WAY WHICH TRAGICALLY HAPPENS A LOT IN OUR SOCIETY RIGHT OR IF THE PLEASURVE DRIVE IS HIGH MAYBE THAT PERSON OVER INDULGES IN THINGS TO PROVIDE SHORTURN GRATIFICATION AND THEN THAT CAUSES A DIFFERENT SET OF PROBLEMS BUT BUT WHAT'S DETERMINISTIC THERE IS WHEATHER WHETHER AGGRESSION OR ASSERTION AGAIN A DIFFERENT WORDS TO THAT DRIVE BUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN CALLING THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE AND THE PLEASURE DRIVE ARE THEY IS ONE OR THE OTHER OR BOTH HIGH ENOUGH TO TRUMP THE GENERATIVE DRIVE OR LOW ENOUGH TO TRUMP THE GENERATIVE DRIVE AND AND I THINK ALL PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE LIKE EVERYTHING FITS INTO THIS MODEL BECAUSE IT HONORS WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT IN HONORS WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND INSICHTS IN TO HUMAN BEHAVIOR OVER HUNDREDS OF YEARS RAY OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS LIKE THE WISOM THAT WE BRINGS FORWARD AND IT IT HONORS THE SCIENCE AND  THAT'S WHY IT FITS TOGETHER BECAUSE I THINK IT HONORS WHO WE ARE AS WHAT ORE SPECIES IS WHAT WE ARE IM AND OU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE WHAT LIFE IS LIKE AS AS WE TRY AND ENGAGE WITH IT I'VE SEEM CASES OF DEMORALIZED PEOPLE WHERE I THEY SIMPLY YOU KNOW DISAPPEAR THAT THEY HIDE THEY ISILY THEY SLOW DOWN THEY TAKE TERRIBLE CARE OF THEIR HEALTH AND IM NOW SADLY I HAVE KNOWN SEVERAL PEOPLE LIKE THIS IN MY LIFETIME I ONE OF WHOM KILLED THEMSELF THE THE OTHER WHOI'M JUST AS AN IMMENSE NUMBER OF HEALTH PROBLEMS RELATED TO OVEREATING AND I'M INACTIVITY AND AND KNOWS IT AND TALKS ABOUT IT AND AND BUT NOTHING SEEMS TO CHANGE TO SPITE MULTIPLE INTERVENTIONS FROM A CARRING STANDPOINT FROM FRIENDS ET CETERA I'VE ALSO SEEN EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DEMORALIZED TO IM SEEM TO BAND WITH OTHER DEMORALIZED PEOPLE SORT OF IUM TRY TO RECALEBRATE THE STANDARD THAT THEY FEEL IM OPPRESSES THEM YOU KNOW THAT THEY AND THIS ISN'T NENESARILY JUST IN THE REALM OF A PHYSICAL FITNESS IS IS ALSO IN THE REALM OF IKSCHOOL DEMANDS II WENT TO A VERY DEMANDING HIGH SCHOOL AS I'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE IN COUPLE POTCAST I BARILY FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL I WAS NOT AN ATTENTIVE STUDENT I WAS MY AM AGGRESSIVE AND PLEASURE DRIVES WENT INTO A NON ACADEMIC ENDEAVORS AND I REGRET THAT YOU KNOW I I HAD SO MUCH MAKING UP OF A OF LEARNING TO DO BY TIME I YOU UNFORTUNATELY GOT TO COLLEGE I EVENTUALLY CAUGHT UP BUT UMMY EXPERIENCE A HIGH SCHOOL WAS THAT THERE WERE THESE UNAL KITS SCORING PERFECTLY ON THE ESSAY TEA IN HE EARLY ADMISSION HARVARD IN EARLY ADMISSION A YALE IN ALL THESE PLACES AND THEN THERE WAS YOU KNOW A DISTRIBUTION IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN THERE WAS A COLLECTION OF KIDS WHO WERE NOT DOING WELL KNEW THEY WEREN'T DOING WELL AND CONT OF BANDED TOGETHER AROUND THE IDEA OF NOT DOING WELL I I DIDN'T A CONSIDER MYSELF PART OF THAT GROUP BECAUSE I I FRANKLY WASN'T THERE THAT OFTEN AND AN UM I WAS FOCASSED ON OTHER THINGS AS I MENTIONED BUT BUT WHAT CAME OF THAT GROUP WAS ACTUALLY QUITE TRAGIC NOT JUST FOR THEM BUT FOR A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE THEY I EVENTUALLY ENGAGED THAT IT WASN'T A SCHOOL SHOOTING TYPES IN ARIA BUT THEY EVENTUALLY YOU KNOW SET OFF EXPLOSIVES AND  ON THE SCHOOL CAMPUS THIS WAS AFTER THEY GRADUATED  I DO'TKO WHERE THEY ARE NOWADAYS BUT THINGS DID NOT GO WELL FOR THEM AND THEY UM EXERTED A LOT OF A DESTRUCTION ATO OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THEM BUT BEFORE THEY DID THAT THERE WAS THIS AND OF ABANDING TOGETHER AROUND THER THE FACT THAT THEY DIDN'T FIT IN THAT THEY AND THEY WEREN'T BULLID AS I RECALL I COULD BE WRONG ABOUT THIS BUT I'VE SEEN THIS ANOTHER FORMS TOO LIKE YOU KNOW IF IF YOU CAN'T MEET THE STANDARD BAND UP WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND CHANGE THE STANDARD AND THEN YOU DON'T FEEL AS DEMORALIZED PERHAPS UM I CAN UNDERSTAND I CAN RATIONALIZE WHY THIS WOULD BE AA REASONABLE APPROACH BUT UMI'M SEEING THIS MORE AND MORE AM I'M ALSO SEEING BY THE WAY YOU KNOW THE OTHER END OF THI SPACTRUM PEOPLE ARE OVERLY AGGRESSIVE AND PLEASURE SEE KAMG IN AN THINGS THAT SORT BUT FOR THE FOR THE MOMENT I'D LIKED  YOUR THOUGHTS ON YOU KNOW HOW DEMORALIZATION CAN SPLIT OFF INTO DIFFERENT EXPRESSIONS DEPENDING ON HOW AM PEOPLE FEEL AND WHO ELSE THEYR REL ATIM TO YE YE W THINK THE PLACE I WOULD START IT IS TO SAY OUR SOCIETY RUSHES HEADLONG FORWARD IN A WAY THAT CAUSES OUR SOCIETY TO TRAMPLE PEOPLE WHO ARE VULNERABLE AND VULNERABLE PEOPLE ARE DEMORALIZED PEOPLE DEMORALIZED PEOPLE ARE VULNERABLE PEOPLE AND OUR SOCIETY OFTEN TRAMPLES THEM AND THEN THEY'RE NOT HERE WITH A SENDING LONGER AND THAT IS TRAGIC BUT AT TIMES THEY DON'T GET TRAMPLE THEY GET CAST ACIDE RIGHT THEY THEY THERE INJURED RIGHT AND CAST THESIDE AND FROM THAT PLACE TRAGIC THINGS HAPPEN RIGHT PEOPLE THEN STAY ISOLATED NOW I THINK IT'S A TRAGEDY THAT WE DON'T ALL BAND TOGETHER AND GO DOOR TO DOOR RIGHT TO LIKE SEEK PEOPLE WHO WHO AREN'T COMING OUT OF DOORS RIGHT YOU KNOW IN THE SENSE OF LIKE WE LET PEOPLE BE SO SO ISOLATED AND AND OFTEN TIMES THAT'S THAT'S THE TRAGIC END OF SOME ONE'S STORY RIGHT BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE DO ENGAGE RIGHT EITHER DEMORALIZED BUT THEY CAN ENGAGE IN IN WAYS THAT INVOLVE AN IN AFILIATIVE DEFENSESO SOMETIMES PEOPLE WHO DEMORALIZED CAN AFFILIATE THEY CAN BAND TOGETHER IN IN WAYS AS I THINK YOU ARE ALLUDING TO THAT CAN THAT CAN MAKE THINGS BETTER SO IF PEOPLE ARE DEMORALIZED BECAUSE SAY THERE I A GROUP IN SOCIETY THAT THAT IS CHRONICALLY VERY MISTREATED RIGHT THEN IT CAN BE VERY POWERFUL TO BAND TOGETHER BOTH BECAUSE THERE'S WHAT'S CALLED IN AFFILIATIVE DEFENSE THAT IF I FEEL BAD ABOUT MYSELF ABOUT SOMETHING AND AM ALONE IT'S HIGHLY LIKELYON CONTINUE FEELING BAD ABOUT MYSELF ABOUT THAT THING RIGHT BUT IF YOU FEEL BAD ABOUT YOURSELF ABOUT THE SAME THING AND THEN WORK TOGETHER RIGHT WE HELP EACH OTHER FEEL BETTER WE DON'T FEEL SO LONELY WE DO ALONE WE ON'T FEEL SO ISOLATED WE DON'T FEEL SO ASHAMED RIGHT SO AND IF FILIATIVE DEFENSE CAN HELP PEOPLE TO TO SAY WITTISICH AND LIKE I AM NOT I'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME AND I'M NOT IN A TAKE THIS LYING DOWN AS OTHNG RIGHT AND AND AND TO MAKE ASSERTIONS THAT CREATE BETTER RIGHTS IN THE WORLD AROUND US SO SOLIT VERY GOOD THINGS CAN HAPPEN FROM FROM AFFILIATION IN THE CONTECTS OF DEMORALIZATION BUT VERY BAD THINGS CAN HAPPEN TOO RIGHT BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN ALSO AFILIATE AROUND THINGS THAT ARE VERY DESTRUCTIVE AND IF I AM HATEFUL OF SOCIETY AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE DESTRUCTIVE AND I'M ALONE OK GI COULD DO DESTRUCTIVE THINGS ALONE BUT IF I BAND TOGETHER WITH A COUPLE OTHER PEOPLE WHO FEEL THAT WAY AND NOW I'M EMPOWER TO FEEL THAT WAY RIGHT INSTEAD IT MAYBE I FEEL THAT WAY AND OR O THER'S RACES AND OR PREJUDICE N I DON'T FEEL AT I I CAN SAY THAT RIGHT BUT THEN WHEN IT'S PERMISSIVE RIGHT BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE ARE I IN THE SAME PLACE THEN PEOPLE CAN ACCENTUATE THAT THE HATRED WITHIN WITHIN THEM SO E FILIATION IS VERY VERY POWERFUL AND PART OF SOCIETY RUSHING SO HEADLONG FORWARD AN EITHER TRAMPLING OR MARGINLIZING PEOPLE IS THAT WE THEN DON'T PAY ATTENTION NOT ENOUGH ATTENTION TO WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE AFFILIATIVE GROUPS RIGHT HOW DO YOU GUIDE PEOPLE TOWARDS TOWARDS BEING ELBU AFFILIATE IN WAYS THAT ARE PRODUCTIVE HOW DO YOU GIVE THEM ROUTS OF BEING PRODUCTIVE RIGHT HOW DO YOU TRY AND PROTECT AGAINST THE WAYS THAT AFFILIATION CAN LEAD TO DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR SO I THINK THAT YOU A LOT OISS THESE ARE THE NATURAL THINGS THAT HAPPEN WITH IN US BUT A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW GETS IMPACTED A LOT BY SOCIETY AND SOCIETAL STANDARDS WHICH WE OF COURSE ALTOGETHER YOU KNOW  DETERMINED RIGHT AND ARISE FROM US BUT THEY ARE THE START TO STO TO TRANSCEND BECAUSE IT'S NOW PEOPLE INTERACTING WITH A WHOLE SOCIAL SYSTEM GOING BACK TO THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM EXCESS AGGRESSION IN PARTICULAR I WAS IN A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEBODY RECENTLY ASVERY SUCCESSFUL LIKE BEYOND MOST PEOPLE'S COMPREHENSION OF SUCCESSFUL FINANCIALLY SUCCESSFUL AND A SEEMS TO JUST A YOUN CHECKED OFF THE THEIR GOALS ONE ONE BOX AT A TIME YOU KNOW FROM FROM GO A BUT WHO DESCRIBE HIS A UNDERLYING PSYCHOLOGY AND EMOTIONAL STATE AS IM ONE IN WHICH MUCH OF WHAT HE DOES ON A DAYTO DAY BASIS IS DRIVEN BY AGGRESSION IN FACT HE I VOLUNTEERED IN ANECDOTE ABOUT THE FACT THAT O'M HE HATES EARLY MORNING MEETINGS ON ZUME BUT HE CHOWS UP TO THEM AS SORT OF A ALIKE AN NEPHEW TOWARD SOMEBODY THAT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE ON THE MEETING AND O AND SO THERE'S A FRICTION POINT FOR HIM THAT ALLOWS HIM TO ENGAGE IN A WAY THAT HE WOULDN'T OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO ENGAGE ANY HE CHANNELS THAT TOWARDS PRODUCTIVITY AND CLEARLY IT'S WORKED FOR HIM A YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S DONE THE SORT OF INTROSPECTIVE A DEEP DIVE II IMAGINE NO THROUGH THE STRUCTURE OF SELF AND FUNCTION OF SELF BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF OF THAT SORT OF EXAMPLE I MEAY NOT I I LIKE THE IDEA THAT IF SOME ONE HAS A STRONG AGGRESSIVE DRIVE THAT THEY WOULD CHANNEL IT TOWARD GOOD I MEAN I NO RETO THINK THIS PERSON IS DOING ANYTHING BUT GOOD IN THE WORLD FOR THEMSELVES AN OTHERS CERTAINLY NOT HARMING ANY ONE AT LEAST NOT TO MOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE BUT THAT SEEMS LIKE A ROUGH PLACE TO LIVE FOR ME IT SEEMS LIKE A ROUGH PLACE TO LIVE AND AT THE SAME TIME I'LL OFFER A VERY BRIEF ANECDOTE THAT YOU KNOW AT ONE POINT IN MY CAREER NAMELY WHEN I WAS A POSTSTOC I WAS IN A POSITION BY VIRTUE OF HAVING LEFT A LABORATORY AND THE NATURE OF THE FIELD AT THE TIME WHERE THE WORK I WANTED TO DO WAS DIRECTLY PITTED AGAINST THE WORK OF ANOTHER VERY POWERFUL LABORATORY EXCEPT THAT I WAS ALONE POSTSTOCK WORKING IN A LABORATORY E SENTSHAL MY OWN ON THIS PROBL AND I REMEMBER GOING TO MY POSTOCK ADVISER THE LATE BEN BARRISS AND SAYING YOU KNOW I THINK IT MIGHT JUST MOVE TO A DIFFERENT PROBLEM BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY WANT TO GO UP AGAINST THIS GOLIATHE AND HE SAID A YOU KNOW THIS IS THE BEST SAID YOU KNON'T I CAN CAPTURE BEN'S VOICE HE SAID THERE ABSOLUTELY NOT LIKE THERE'S NOWHEYE YOU LOVE THI STUFF YOU HAVE TO DO IT BECAUSE YOU LOVE IT AND HE KEPT TELLIG ME HOW MUCH I LOVE IT AND HE REMINDED ME THAT INDEED I DID LOVE THE QUESTIONS AND ONCE I WAS ABLE TO TAP BACK IN TO THE LOVE FOR IN THE CURIOSITY AROUND THE QUESTIONS I WAS ABLE TO PUSH ASIDE THE THE CONCERNS ENOUGH THAT WE DID WELL AM IN PUBLISHING CERTAIN PAPERS THEY DID WELL BUT THOSE FIVE YEARS FRANKLY WERE A LOT LESS PLEASUREFUL THAN THEY COULD HAVE BEEN I THINK BECAUSE MUCH OF THE SCRIPT IN MY HEAD WAS THAT I WAS IN FRICTION WITH THIS LIKE YOU KNOW AT LEAST IN MY MIND THIS OPPRESSIVE FORCE IT WAS IT WAS PURELY COMPETITIVE AND I TRULY BELIEVE THAT WE CAN'T BE AT IN OUR MOST CREATIVE STATE WHEN WE ARE COMPETING WAS SOME ONE ELSE BY DEFINITION BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE YOUR OUR CREATING AGAINST A STANDARD AS SUPPOSED TO WRAW CREATION I  SO IM IN BOTH CASES A LOT OF AGGRESSIVE DRIVE FRANKLY I I I HAVE SOME OF THAT AND I HAD THAT IM BUT A DESIRE FOR REVENGE A A COMPONENT OF FRICTION MIXED IN YO ITNORED WERE DEGRATED WITH THIS INAGGRESSIVE DRIVE LIKE THIS PICTURE LIKE EVEN AS I DESCRIBE IT IS OU NOW CAUSING THE RELEASE OF A LITTLE ELL BUT OF A DRANAL AND IT'S IT'S NOT A COMFORTABLE STATE IIT'S NOT IT IT CAN'T BE A STATE OF HAPPINESS RIGHT SAS YET PEOPLE CAN DO GOOD IN THE WORLD THEY CAN DO NOT GOOD IN WELLY WHEN I MAKE A VALUE JUDGMENT ABOUT WHAT THE PERSON IS DOING BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT THE QUESTION IS ABOUT RIGHT WIT LIKE HOWARDLY FEELING HOW ARE THEY DOING RIGHT WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF THEM AND THAT CAN'T BE HAPPY IGHT THAT CAN'T BE HAPPY BECAUSE IF IF IF YOU'RE BUILT TO BE PRETTY GOOD AT COMPETITION RIGHT SO YOU YOU CAN SIZE UP WHAT ARE THE FACTORS YOU KNOW YOU CAN STRATAGIZE WAY SO A PRISON IS BUILL TO BE REALLY GOOD AT COMPETITION THAND YOU KNOW IT SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD TO MAKE EVERYTHING A COMPETITION RIGHT BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE HIGHEST WINNING PERCENTAGE RIGHT AND BUT THAT'S THAT'S GOOD TO ACHIEVE SOME END RIGHT THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY FEELING INTRINSICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH IT RIGHT AND IF ALL YOU'R DOING IS A SERIES OF COMPETITIONS AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING THEN IS WINNING RIGHT AN LIKE WINNING IS SOMETHING LIKE A WINNING IS  I WANT I BEAT YOU WHUT IT WHATEVER THAT IS I THAT THAT CAN BE PART OF HAPPINESS BUT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RIGHT THAT THAT'S NOT HAPPINESS RIGHT SO SO YES THAT KIND OF I'M I'MREALLY BUILT TO COMPETE WELL AND I'M GOING TO JUST SEE A SERIES OF COMPETITIONS IN FRONT OF ME THAT'S IT FOR FOR EXPEDIENT FORWARD PROGRESS RIGHT THAT'S VERY EFFECTIVE BUT ITGAIN EXPEDIENT FOR PROGRESS ISN'T IE'S NOTHING TO DO WITH PES CONTENTMEN DELIY LIKE IS IT'S IT'S NOT YOU KNOW IT ISN'T ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT NOR DIS ANYTHING TO DO WITH DOING GOOD OR BAD RIGHT AND I THINK THE EXAMPLE YOU GAVE IN YOUR OWN IN YOUR CAREERS I IT'S SUCH A GOOD EXAMPLE RIGHT BECAUSE NOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT WHEND THE WAY THAT YOU ARE SO A FRAMING IT INSIDE IS LIKE THERE'S A QUESTION I'M ASKING THERE'S A QUESTION THEY'RE ASKING RIGHT AND THERE'S A COMPETITION RIGHT THEY GAIN'T HAS TO BE TOO TOO TO COMPETE RIGHT SO SO THERE'S ALMOST AN AUTOMATICITY RIGHT THAT IT THE STUDYING THE SAME THING MAYBE YOU KNOW THEY FEEL COMPETITIVE OR CERTAIN PEOPLE THERE TOO THEY WERE WE'RE IN ARE DEFINITELY COMPETITIVE THEY KNOW WHO THEY ARE RATHER EXTREMELY O BUT AND VERY SUCCESSFUL OOK IT SO THEN SO THEN YOU LOK COME INTA COMPETITION NOW AGAIN BUT YOU NEVER DECIDED TO BE IN A COMPETITION RIGHT BUT BUT AUTOMATICALLY RIGHT MIT'S INTERESTING RIGHT TO UNDERSTAND YOUYOU'R ACTING S IF YOUREIN A COMPETITIONERS I DON'T WANT THIS COMPETITION RIGHT BECAUSE LIKE THER BIGGER THAN MES CAN BE UNPLEASANT IS GOING TO TAKE YOU AWAY FROM REALLY THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO RIGHT IS GOING TO MAKE IT HARDER TO DO A GOOD TO DO THE JOB YOU WANT TO DO RIGHT IS NEITHER EMBROILED AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT HAS A GRESSION BEHIND IT RIGHT SO SO YOU CHOOSE NOW I DON'T IT I CHOOSE NOT TO DO THAT RIGHT AND THEN THEN BARRISS REFRAMES IT TO THE TRUTH AND SAYS WHAT THIS THIS ISN THIS IS NOT A COMPETITION BAUSE YOU'RE NOT CHOOSING A COMPETE RIGHT BET HA'S BEEN POINTED OUT WHAT WAS IMPORTANT TO YOU WAS THE QUESTIONS RIGHT SO IT'S LIKE ALMOST AS IF BEN REMINDED ITIS NOT THROUGH THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE LOOK AT IT THROUGH THE GENERA T IVE DRIVE THAT'S WHAT WINS OUT IN YOU RIGHT AND THEN YOU GO AND APPLY YOURSELF TO IT NOW AND BLESS HIM FOR DOING IT BECAUSE OUT FROM THAT POINT FORWARD I I'VE MADE IT MY I'M FIRM MISSION TO ALWAYS DO THINGS FROM A PLACE OF WHAT I WAS THINK ABOUT AS DELIGHT YOU KNOW CURIOSITY DELIGHT THAT THE THINGS THAT GIVE ME ENERGY AND THAT GIVE ME MORE ENERGY FROM DOING THEM I'M IT WASN'T E COINCIDENCE I BELIEVE THAT IN THOSE FIVE YEARS WHEN I WAS OPERATING FROM A MIX OF GENERATIVE DRIVE AND THE THE COMPETITION WOULD THEN RESURFICE AND AT YOU KNOW I I COULDN'T HOLD HOLD IT CONSTANT THAT I'M I WAS ABSOLUTELY EXHAUSTED BY THE END OF THAT PHASE I JUST IN A WAY THAT I'M SUCKED A LOT OF THE PLEASURE OUT OF IT I STILL DRIVE SOME PLEASURE BUT THEN AS I MENTION FORTUNATELY I WAS ABLE TO I PIVIT BACK TO DOING THINGS OUT OF LOVE YOU KNOW AND AND AND GETTING BACK TO A PIECE CONTENTMENT AND ESPECIALLY DELIGHT RIGHT NOW RIGHT AND I ABSOLUTELY MAKE A VALUE JUDGMENT ABOUT THAT RIGHT THAT WHAT YOU DID IS BETTER RIHT SO WHAT IF YOU DID WHAT IF YOU WERE DIFFERENT SO THING BUT IF WE TALK ABOUT IT THROUGH THIS ACCURATE LENDS WHAT IF YOU WERE DIFFERENT AT THAT TIME AND THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVEIN YOU WAS GREATER THAN THE GENERATIVE DRIVING YOU RIGHT WE SHOULD BE AN UNHEALTHY STATE TO BE AND BUT LET'S SAY YOU WERE IN THAT UNHEALTHY STATE THEN YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE STILL DONE WHAT YOU DID BUT YOU'D HAVE DONE IT THROUGH THE LENDS OF AGGRESSION LIKE IGING TO GET THAT RIGHT NIARE COMPETITIVE WITH THEM THERE'S THERE'S ANGER IN YOU THERE'S YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S A GRESSION RIGHT THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE ENACTING IN FANTASY AS YOU'RE YOU KNOW YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THEM AND OW YOU'RE GING TO WIN LIKE ALL SORTS OF THINGS GO ON INSIDELASS AND I WOULD SAY THERE'S NO WAY ON EARTH YOU COULD HAVE DONE THE SCIENCE AS WELL AS YOU DID RIGHT IT COULDN'T BE BECAUSE ALL THAT STUFF IS DISTRACTING RIGHT IT' SEE OW THAT KIND OF NEGATIVE E AFFECT POOLS FOR ENERGY IN TIME FROM YOU AND ALSO WHAT SEEDS WOULD YOU HAVE PLANTED IN THE THE MICROCOSM THAT YOU OPERATE AND RIT MORE MORE COMPETITION RIGHT MORE COMPETITIDIS MORE BADNESS RIGHT SO LIS TOOK T WHAT YOU DID DO RIGHT BECAUSE YOURE HEALTHY OR THIS PARTICULAR QUESTION ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR THING WE KNOW FOR SURE BECAUSE YOUR GENERATIVE DRIVE ECLIPSES THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE THEN YOU SET YOURSELF TO THE WORK IN A WAY THAT'S CAN T BE MORE EFFECTIVE RIGHT YOUR BRAIN ISN'T CLATDED YOU'RE NOT WASTING ENERGY WE KNOW PLOTTING SOME REVENGE OR PLOTTING WHAT YOU'RE OING TO DO IF THEY COME O TAKE SOMETHING FROM YOUR LAVEING WHATEVER IT IS YOU NONLY YOU'RE NOT LIVING IN ANY OF THAT'S YOU CAN DO A BETTER JOB AT WHAT YOURE WHAT' SO IMPORTANT TO YOU TO DO AND WHAT SEEDS ARE YOU SEWING THEN RIGHT YOUYOUR SEWING SEEDS OF COLLABORATION RIGHT AND EVEN THEN IF SOME ONE COULD SAY WELL WHAT IS EVEN THAT MATTER RIGHTS IT TY DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE DOING THEN WE JUST TOFALLOW FOR THE MATH OF IT RIGHT IS IS CONTRIBUTING TO UNDERSTANDING THAT'S CONTRIBUTING TO HUMAN HEALTH RIGHT AND THE BETTER UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE OF HUMAN HEALTH THE MORE PEOPLE SAY ALIVE AND THE MORE PEOPLE SAY HEALTHY WHICH COULD MEAN ANY ONE OF US JUST LIKE ANY ONE OF US COULD BE THE VULNERABLE PERSON THAT SOCIETY TRAMPLES OR CAST ASIDE WE 'LL HAVE IT IN US TO BE THAT OR AVE BEEN THAT AT STAGES OF OUR LIVES RIGHT WE ALSO ALL HAVE IT IN US TO BE THE OPPOSITE OF THAT  RIGHT WE HAVE IT IN US TO BE GENERATIVE WE HAVE IT IN US TO MAKE GOOD WE HAVE IT IN US TO CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTH TO SURVIVAL AND THAT I PLACE O VALUE JUDGMENT UPON IT'S WHY DOING GOOD IS BETTER THAN DOING BAT WHY CREATING IS BETTER THAN DESTROYING AND WHY ULTIMATELY IS THE GENERATIVE DRIVE THAT HAS TO TRUMP THE OTHER DRIVES AND WHEN IT DOES WERE HAPPY WE'RE HEALTHY WE MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE WE ALIE WITH AND ARE SUFFUSED WITH THE GRATITUDE AND AGENCY IN US ARE FULLY ACTIVE AND WERE SUFFUSED WITH PEACE CONTENT MEANT TO DELIGHT AS YOU SAID THAT'S THE PLACE TO BE FROM THAT PLACE WE GET THIS THING THAT WE WANT AND WE HELP TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE WHICH HELPS US TO KEEP THE THING WE WANT IT'S SOUNDS SO SIMPLE BECAUSE AS YOU POINTET OUT THE MANIFESTATIONS OF LOOKING AT THE RIGHT THINGS AND DOING THE RIGHT THINGS ARE SO SIMPLE YES RIGHT IT'S IT'S OLIST REALLY AND AGAIN WE HAVE A PT F THAT INCLUDES THIS LIST AND AND THE THE STRUCTURE OF OF THE PILLARS AND HOW THEY FLOW UP TO THIS LIST BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S PEACE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT YOU KNOW UNDERGURDED BY AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AS ACTIVE TERMS OMTHING VERY SIMPLE AT SOME LEVEL UM AND YET FOR MANY PEOPLE INCLED MYSELF AT CERTAIN TIMES IN LIFE THE THE UNEXCESS OR WERE A LACK OF AGGRESSIVE DRIVE WERE EXCESS OR LACK OF PLEASURE DRIVE CAN INTERFERE WITH PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO ACCESS THESE THESE SIMPLE BUT UNINCREDIBLY POWERFUL UNBEING STATES AUSE IT'S NATURE AND NURTURE RIGHT SO YOU MIGHT BE BUILT WITH A GREATER OR LESSER NATURAL AMOUNT OF ONE DRIVE THAN I AM RIGHT WITH THN WE'VE HAD LIFE EXPERIENCE THAT CREATES A DELTA AROUND THEM RIGHT SO SO WE SAY OCA WERE BUILT WITH DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF ALL THESE DRIVES YES YES WE ARE RIGHT BUT WE ALSO HAVE CONTROL RIGHT THROUGH OUR DECISIONS TO HOW WE HANDLE OUR LIVES TO MODULATE THEM RIGHT SO THAT MAKE SENSE CAUSE THE THOUGHT BE WILL  THE DRIVE IS WITH THE DRIVE IS AND IT VARIES ACROSS PEOPLE NO THERE'S ARRANGE THE DRIVE IS IN AND THAT RANGE CAN BE VERY BROAD OAN PEOPLE CAN DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS TO CULTIVATE  CULTIVATE THE BETTER WE ALL CAN RIGHT SO IF WE LOOK AT IT AS AN UNLIMITED UPSIDE RIGHT THAN WHAT WE WHAT WE SEES I WANT TO KNOW WHERE THEY AT IN ME NOW RIGHT WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF ME WHAT ARE ALL THOSE OTHER FACTORS RIGHT BECAUSE I WANT TO CULTIVATE THE GOOD WHEN T CULTIVATE THAT GENERATIVE DRIVES AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE AGGRESSION AND THE PLEASURE ARE AND OUT TOBALANCE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER LIGHT WE CAN ACTIVELY LOOK AT THAT AND MANAGE IT AND I THINK THAT'S LOOKS SO WHAT WE'RE STRIVING FOR BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING HERE THAT WE DON'T HAVE SOME CONTROL OVER RIGHT AND THE HIGHER WE GET UP WY THE SIMPLER IT GETS THE MORE WE HAVE CONTROL OVER AND FOR PEOPLE WHO FEEL LIKE THE THE IDEALS THAT WERE PROVIDING A ROAD MAP TOWARD ARE NOT ACCESSIBLE FOR WHATEVER REASON MAY BE H FEELING A LITTLE BIT OR A LOT DEMMORALIZED A OVERLY AGGRESSIVE AND NOT ENDING UP WHERE THEY WANT TO GO OR ENDING UP WHERE THEY WANT TO GO AND NOT EXPERIENCING DEEP SATISFACTION PECE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT WHERE SHOULD THEY LOOK IN THIS FRAME WORK THAT INCLUDES THESE PILLARS THAT THE DEEP LEVELS OF STRUCTURE OF SELF FUNCTION OF SELF THAT Y AM GIVE RISE TO EMPOWERMENT HUMILITY AGENTS SEE GRATITUDE PEACE CONTENTMENT TO LIKE YOU IF SOME ONE SHOULD FIND THEMSELVES UNMOTIVATED OR WOR STOCK YOU KNOW A METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING STARING OUT THE WINDOW INTO THE GARDEN THAT COULD BE AND THAT THEY WANT SO VERY MUCH BUT THATHEY'RE NOT CREATING AGAIN THAT SHOULD TRANSLATE TO WHATEVER DOMAIN OF LIFE IT YOURE YOU'RE SEEKING ARE NOT EVEN IN TOUCH WITH WHAT YOU REALLY WANT YOUINFINITELY CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT TO DO AND RELATIONSHIPS SCHOOL WORK LIFE YOU KNOW AND AND THINKING ABOUT ALL THE OPPRESSIVE FORCES IN THE WORLD LIKE THE POLITICAL CHASM AND YOU KNOW PENDAMICS AND LOCK DOWNS AND LIKE AND ALL THE STUFF AND ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE WAIING DOWN ON US AF WHAT SHOULD THAT PERSON ANOTHER WIS WHAT SHOULL WE ALL DO AT THAT MOMENT YOU NO STOP AND WHAT EACH PILLAR HAS FIVE CUPBOARDS LOOK IN ALL FIVE AND FOLLOW THE CLUES THAT YOU FIND THERE THAT'S THE ANSWER SO GO BACK TO STRUCTURE OF SELF FUNCTION OF SELF ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT AND ENGAGE IN PRACTICES THAT BRING ABOUT MORE SELF AWARENESS PRACTICES THAT IM DRAW OUR ATTENTION TO WHAT SALIENT FOR US ASK OURSELVES YOU KNOWWHAT AM I THINKING ABOUT INTERNALLY WHAT IS MY INTERNAL SCRIPT WHAT IT WHAT AM MY FOCESSING ON EXTERNALLY YOU NW M EAM I SPENDING ALL DAY ON TWITTER LOOKING AT ACCOUNTS THAT I KNOW I HATE BECAUSE IT ACTIVATE SOMETHING IN ME ET CETER ET CETERA I MIGHT HAVE REVEALED SOMETHING ABOUT MYSELF I'M JUST GETTING THAT'S NOT MY MY BEEVERYBUT I SEE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE DOING IT OW WHAT ARE MY BEHAVORAL CHOICES YOU KNOW ON WHAT COULD BRING ABOUT MORE HOPEFULNESS AND INSTRIVINGS NOT HAVE THAT RIGHTING THIS ETINIS SO MUCH OF THIS AS SAY ONE COULD DO ON ONE'S OWN RIGHTA WE CAN THINK ABOUT OURSELVES HEN WE CAN LEARN THINGS IF WE SAY WI DON'TREALY KNOW THAT MUCH  ABOUT DEFENCE MECHANISMS CALI WE CALD READ ABOUT IT RIGHTLY WE CAN DO A LOT OF THIS ON OUR OWN AND WE CAN GET SO MUCH FROM TALKING OTHER PEOPLE YOU KNOW PEOPLE IN OUR LIVES WHO ARE CLOSE TO US WHO LOVE US RIGHT WE CAN TALK WITH THEM ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE OF US AND THAT IS SUCH AN AMAZING MECHANISM OF LEARNING AND THEY'RE ALSO PROFESSIONAL RESOURCES I MEANG LIKE THE GOOD THERAPYSHOULD ENCOMPASS THAT THIS SHOULD BE WHAT IT'S DOING RIGHT IT MIGHT COME OUT THROUGH ONE LANDS OR ANOTHER LANDS AND YOU KNO CAUSE EVERYEVERYBODY'S DIFFERENT IF WE CAN RING DIFFERENT MODALITIES BUT ULTIMATELY THAT'S WHAT GOOD THERABE IS DOING RIGHT IT'S LOOKING IN ALL TEN OF THOSE CUPBOARDS AND ITS SEEING WHERE IS THE ISSUE LET'S FOLLOW THE CLUES LIKEIT'S A SPIRITED INQUIRY RIGHT WHETHER WE'RE DOING IT ON OUR OWN OR WE'RE DOING IT WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN OUR PERSONAL LIVES O WE'RE DOING IT WITH SOME ONE PROFESSIONALLY IT'S A SPIRITED INQUIRY TO FOLLOW THE CLUES BECAUSE IF WE FOLLOW THE CLUES THERE ARE ANSWERS RIGHT AND IF WE HAVE THE ANSWERS THEN WE CAN BRING THINGS INTO BETTER LINEMENT AND THEN WE'RE IN A BETTER PLACE THAS PILLOWS OR MORE STABLE AND WE CAN BUILD ON TOP OF THEM WHAT WE WANT TO BUILD ON TOP OF THEM AND THE DRIVES COME BETTER INTO LINE THAT THAT WE CAN DO THAT AND THET CAN BE IN ITERATIVE PROCESS OF YOU KNOW IF IF WE WE TAIN SOME BETTER STATE OF MIND AND LIKE LIFE IS BETTER AND LIKE WE'RE HAPPY LIKE THIS HAPPENS TO PEOPLE TIS A LOT OF CONTENTMENT AN PEACE AND IF THINGS ARE GOING WELL AND NOW SOMETHING ISN'T AS MUCH GO BACK AND LOOK AGAIN RIGHT IT'S IT'S A PROCESS WE CAN USE OVER AND OVER BECAUSE IT WORKS BECAUSE IT FITS WITH THE TRUTHS AN THE REALITY IS AS WE HAVE UNDERSTOOD LEARN THEM IN OR EDUCATION THE THE OTHE UST LEARNING ABOUT HUMANS THATACROSS HUNDREDS OF YEARS TELLS US THIS IT MAKES VERY GOOD SENSE TO ME IN THE WAY THAT YOU HAVE MAPPED IT OUT FOR US UM SO MUCH SENSE IN FACT THAT AM JUST STRUCK BY HOW DIVERGENT IT IS FRAM WHAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE THINK OF WHEN THEY THINK OF THERAPY OR THET SOME OF THE RISKS OF GOING TO A PSYCHIATRIST M WHICH I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR TO CONSIDER IN PARTICULAR THE WAY THAT AM LEAST FROM MY OUTSIDE NON CLINICAL UNDERSTANDING A THESE SORTS OF SITUATIONS OF HIGH LEVELS OF DEMORALIZATION OR EXCESSIVE AGGRESSION OR JUST PEOPLE NOT BEING IN THE PLACE OR BEING ABLE TO EXERT THEIR THEY WERE AM THER ACTIONS IN THE WORLD THE WAY THEY WANT OR NOT GET THE RESULTS THEY WANT IS THEY'LL START ASKING QUESTIONS LIKE A YOU KNOW MAYBE HAVE A CHEMICAL AND BALANCE OR OMAYBE THEY'LL GO TO A CLINISH AND MAYBE A COGNY OF BEHAVIORAL THERAPIST OR AM OR PSYCHIATRIST AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IT SEEMS THEY'LL GET IN ALL PRESCRIPTION FOR EXT NUMBER OF MILIGRAMS OF SOM PSERATONERGIC AGONIST OR A DOPOMINERGIC AGONIST AND OF COURSE AS AN ERABIOLOGISTS I I UKNOW I APPLAUD THE EXPLORATION OF UNDERLYING BRAIN MECHANISMS AND THE EVOLVEMENT OF NARMODULATORS LIKE DOPOMING AND SAR ATONAN BUT WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING TODAY IS IS VERY DIFFERENT I I THINK THEN AM WHAT MOST PEOPLE AR CAN EXPECT IF THEY GO TO THE TYPICAL PSYCHIATRIST OR TYPICAL A PSYCHOLOGIST WHICH IS PAR THE REASON WERE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION BUT A I LOVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT AM AND I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THIS ABOUT ME I ONLY OFFER THIS ANECDOTE AS AM AWAY TO ROUND OUT A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR EARLIER DISCUSSION II'LL NEVER SHARED THIS PUBLICLY BUT WHEN I WAS A POSTOCH IN GOING THROUGH THAT VERY HARD PHASE OF COMCOMPETITION THAT I DIDN'T WANT AND HAVING A HARD TIMES STAYING IN TOUCH WITH THAT AND THERE WERE SOME OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL THINGS TRYING TO RESURFACE JUST BY VIRTUE OF MOVING BACK TO THE TOWN I GREW P BIN ET CETERA THERE I RECALL GETTING TO THE STAIRWAY OF THE BUILDING I WAS WORKING AND ATHE TIME WHICH IS THE SAME ONE WHERE MY LABORATORY EXISTS NOW ACTUALLY AND REALIZING I I COULN'T GO UP THE STAIRWAY I H'VE ALWAYS BEEN REASONABLY FIT UM AND JUST BEING SO EXHAUSTED AND THEN DRIVING HOME THAT DAY ON TWO EIGHTY IN THINKING YOU KNOW LIKE NON AS MATTERS LIKE WHAT A MI DOING THINK NONE OF IT MATTERS I COULD HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS BUT WHAT THAT ULTIMATELY RESULT AND WAS ME TALKING TO A PSYCHIATRIS WHO GAVE ME A LODOSE OF A OF A UM OF A SERATONERGIC ANT I DEPRESSINT I TOOK THAT LODOSE OF SERATONERGA ANTA DEPRESS I ON'T RECALL WHICH ONE IT WAS MAYBE WATS THE TALEPRAM WOITD THAT MY SENSE AND UM SPENT THAT EVENING STARING AT MY PLATE OF TIE NOODLES FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS IT HIT ME REALLY HARD AND AND I HATED THAT FEELING AND THAT JUST STOP TAKING THE DRUG U NOW I'M NOT THIS IS NO KNOCK ON SETALEPRAM OR THE USE OF SERATONURGIGAGIONS IN THE PROPER CONTECTS THEY'VE SAVED LIVES O THE THE PROBLEMATIC TOO BUT I JUST YOU KNOW THAT WASN'T THE ROUTE THAT EVENTUALLY GOT ME OUT OF IT IT WAS IT WAS MAINLY TALK THERAPE AND AND SELF CARE UM BUT I I JUST OFF FER THAT BECAUSE I YOU KNOW I EVEN AS AN EUROBIOLOGIST I PERHAPS ESPECIALLY AS ANEUROBILE JUST I THOUGHT UKET HERE'S THE SOLUTION I IT'S GOIN TO SHIFT SOME INTERNAL MODULATORY SYSTEM AND I'M AN FEEL KE ABOUT THE SITUATION I'M IN AND THANK GOODNESS IT DIDN'T WORK EVEN FOR A SHORT WHILE  BECAUSE UM THE WHILE I DIDN'T DO ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING HERE OF EXPLORING THE FUNCTION OF SELF BECAUSE NODS EVER LAID THIS OUT FOR ME I UM I TOOK THE ROUTIF OF A TALK THERAPE WHICH I FINED IMMENSELY A BENEFICIAL UM TAKES TIME BUT IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL UM SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE CURRENT STRAGIES FOR DIAGNOSIS A WHERE THOSE SUCCEED WHERE THEY FALL SHORT AND IN THE ROLE OF MEDICATION IN NAVIGATING THIS YOU KNOW SIMPLE AND YET CAL PLEX LANDSCAPE  WE ARE SO DRAMATICALLY OVER REDUCTIONIST YOU KNOW IT'S ALMOST TO THE POINT OF UNBELIEVABLE RIGHT MNTHINK ABOUT GETTING A MEDICINE GETTING SOME SAY TELOPRAM BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED RIGHT IT CAN'T POSSIBLY WORK RIGHT NOW MAYBE A JUDICIOUSLY CHOSEN MEDICINE COULD PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE DISTRESS TOLERANCE AND YOU COULD SO TO THINK ABOUT IT MORE AND OU COULD FIND YOUR WAY THROUGH IT BUT CLEARLY IT WAS AN ISSUE OFSELF RIGHT LIKE YOURE IN A SITUATION THAT WAS HI STRADICINEYWHERE YOU CAN HAVE TO HAVE THIS COMPETITION OR NOT AS IT CAN BE GOOD FOR YOU AND YOU KNOW YOUYOU DON'T WANT THAT BUT CAN YOU AVOID IT LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON THAT MAKES YOU NOT BE ABLE TO WALK UP THOSE STAIRS RIGHT SO SO THAT YOU AM NOT CRITICIZING OUTON WITH THE PERSON WHAT KIND OF CONVERSATIONS YOU HAD ABOUT IT WITH VIS BUT THE IDEA THAT A PILBILE FIX THAT IS LIKE THAT'S INSANE RIGHT NOW MEDICINES CAN HELP SMOOTH THE WAY SO SO LET'S SAY YOU YOU INITIALLY WEN IN THE FIRST TIME YOU SEE SOME ONE N THEY SOOK IT WITH TO TALK ABOUT THIS RELER WAS GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE AND YOU KNOK AS NORMALLY YOU CAN WALK UPSTAIRS AND GO TO WORK RIGHT WHY CAN'T YOU NOW LIKE WE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT LET'S SAY START DOING THAT N YOUR HAVING LOT OF TROUBLE WITH IT A WHERE JUST HAVING REALLY HIGH LEVELS OF ANXIETY WE MIGHT SEE LOK AN MEDICINE CAN CANOT TAKE THE TEMPERATURE DOWN A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW GIVE YOU LITTLE MORE DISTRESS TOLERANCE AND THEN YOU KNOW WE CAN YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IT BETTER INSIDE OF YOU AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT BETTER BUT IT'S MEDICINE IN THE SERVICE OF UNDERSTANDING NOW SOMETIMES MEDICINES ARE DOING THINGS LIKE MEDICINES THAT CAN NOL BUT PREVENT BY POLLAR EPISODES RIGHTLIC THAT THI THE'R DOING SOMETHING THAT IS PURELY BYOLOGICAL BUT WE OU SO MANY MEDICINES FOR THINGS THAT ARE NOT BIOLOGICAL THEIR PSYCHOLOGICAL BUT WE WE'RE SO OVER REDUCTIONISTS THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY OVER REDUCE THE PROBLEM THAT YOU SAT RIGHT LIKE A CLEAR WHILE THAT'S FASCINATING RIGHT LIKE HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU GONE UP THOSE STAIRS AND NOW YOU CAN'T IT'S SO INTERESTING T IDEA LIKE A SISCIVE YOU PILL I MEAN IT REALLY MAKES NO SENSE BUT IF WE'RE OVER REDUCTION IS ENOUGH YOU COULD SEE HOW THAT'S THE LOGICAL ENDPOINT OF AN ILLOGICAL PROCESS RIGHT I ME BET ANOTHER EXAMPLE ANDS IS REALLY A TRUE STORY OF A A WOMAN WHO YOUNG WOMAN COMES INTO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND SAYS SHE CAN'T SLEEP AND OW SHE LOOKS ANXIOUS AND SHE FEELS VERY VERY ANXIOUS A YOURE BY HER DESCRIPTION THAT IS WHY SHE CAN'T SLEEP AND AND SHE GETS A SLEEPING MEDICINE AN SHE GOES HOME AND THEN SHE COMES BACK  BACK COUPLE O DAYS LATER AND SHE'S VERY VERY ANXIOUS AND SHE CAN'T SLEEP AND SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE DID BEFORE OR LIKE NOTHING SEEMS TO BE DIFFERENT AND SHE HASN'T GOTTEN ANY SLEEP IT ALSO THE DOCTOR IN CHARGE GIVES HER A HIREDOSE OF THE SLEEPING MEDICINE THEN SHE GOES HOME AND THEN SHE COMES BACK YET AGAIN AND NOTHING IS ANY DIFFERENT SHE'S STILL NOT SLEEPING SHE'S STILL ANXIOUS AND THEN THE DOCTOR CONCLUDES THAT SHE'S DRUG SEEKING BECAUSE SHE WANTS MORE AND MORE OF THE SLEEPING MEDICINE EY WAS ACTUALLY GOING ON WAS SHE IS GETTING HURT AT HOME SHE'S TERRIFIED TO GO HOME OF COURSE SHE COULDN'T SLEEP RIGHTLY BAD THINKS WE'RE HAPPENING IGHT BUT NO ONE ASKED THE QUESTION RIGHT THEY THOUGHT SHE CANNOT SLEEP WELL GIVE SLEEPING MEDICINE IHT INSTEAD OF ASKING WHY RIGHT AND THEN SHE GETS HOME JOS SEND HOME AND WHEN THE MEDICINE DOESN'T WORK WELL NOW THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER RIGHT AND IF YOU PUT THAT LABEL ON HER NOW SHE'S DRUG SEEKING RIGHT THAND SHE'S NOT GOIN TO GET ANY HELP IGHT SO I'M NOT AGAINST MEDICINES I MEAND I I USE PSYCHO FORM A COLLOGYIS PART OF MY PRACTISE AND I THINK FROM A FROM A BIOLOGICALLY BASE PERSPECTIVE ABOUT MANY THINGS BUT YOULIFE TO KNOW WHAT SOMETHING IS THE ANSWER FOR AND WHAT'S O TINK IS NOT THEY ANSWER FOR AND IN IN THE OVERLY REDUCTIONIS WORLD OF THROUH PUT AND IN HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS PEOPLE ARE EVENBEING TRAINED THESE DAYS THAT DON'T KNOW ANY DIFFERENT RIGHT I AM TRY TO BE OVERLY CRITICAL OF PRACTITIONERS WAS OFTEN PRACTITIONERS ARE WORKING IN IMPOS SIBLE SITUATIONS WHERE THE GOAL IS THROU THROUGH PUT AND THAT'S MORE EFFICIENT IN THE SHORT TERM IGHT IS MORE EFFICIENT TODAY  BUT IT'S OF COURSE NOT GOOD IN ANYTHING BUT THE TO DAY TERM AND IT'S INTERESTING JU IT'S NEVER GOOD FOR THE PERSON EVEN TODAY IT'S LIKE NEVER GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE IN IT RIGHT BUT BUT OFTEN THESE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE IT BASE UPON BUSINESS AND MONEY AND I UNDERSTAND BUSINESS AN MONEY A AN I'M A CAPITALIST'M INTERESTED IN THESE THINGS BUT THE WAY THAT WE HAVE LET THINGS GET THE BUSINESS AND MONEY WITH A SHORT SIGHTED THE SHORT TERM PERSPECTIVE THAN BONDS WITH THE OVER REDUCTIONISTS WAYS THAT WE APPROACH MEDICINE AND THEN WE HAVE THESE BIZAARRE THINGS HAPPEN AND THESE KIND OF BIZAARRE THINGS AND LIVES RIGHT CHANGE THE COURSES OF LIVES LIKE FORTUNATELY YOU OU KNOW YOU GOT YOU'D GOT WHAT YOU NEEDED AND YOU FIGURED THINGS OUT BUT IF YOU HADN'T WOULD YOU HAVE THE CAREER YOU HAVE LOOKING WE DON'T KNOW RIGHT OR IF IF SOME ONE ELSE HADN'T REALIZED LIKE LET'S TALK TO THAT WOMAN AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON THOY WHICH WOULD SHE HAVE SURVIVE AND WE DON'T WE DON'T KNOW BUT H THE POINT OF THAT IS LIKE LOTS OF BAD THINGS HAPPEN RIGHT IS WE'RE ROLLING THE DICE TOO MANY TIMES WITH TOO MANY PEOPLE AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY AND THE WAY THAT WE'RE DOING IT NOW IS NOT ONLY INEFFICIENT YOU FINANCIALLY WRITE THE THING THT WE SEEM TO BE CARRYING ABOUT MOST IT  LEADS TO BAD OUTCOMES AND IT ALSO MAKES NO SENSE RI WERE LOOKING AT IT THROUGH THE SORT OF BIZAARRE LENDS THEN WE MAY FIND WITHIN US THE STRENGTH TO CHANGE THAT AND TO CHANGE IT IN WAY THAT ACTUALLY FITS THE SCIENCE AND FITS THE COMMON SENSE I HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT BOTH FOR PEOPLE WHO REQUIRE MEDICATION IN ORDER TO COPE AM IN ORDER TO MANAGE THEIR WAY THROUGH THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT FUNCTION OFSELF AND HOW THEY ARE IN THE WORLD WHAT THEIR PAYING ATTENTION TO ET CETERA AND FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T REQUIRE MEDICATION TO DO THIS EXPLORATION THAT THIS VERY SAME EXPLORATION IS THE ROAD MAP TO FEELING YES AGENCY GRATITUDE PEACE CAN TENTIMENT THAN TELIGHT MEDICINES MAY HAVE A ROLE SO IF FOR EXAMPLE WWE GO'T LOOK AT THE PILLARS AND THINKS HE'RE NOT GOING SO WELL AND AN YOU SEE THAT WHENEVER THAT PERSON HAS A BIPOLAR MANIC EPISODE WHILE THINGS GET REALLY REALLY DAMAGED AND ET IT'S VERY VERY HARD THAT THEY CAN'T RECOVER FROM THAT IN THE WAYS THEY WANT TO THN WE SIT LET'S RUDUS MEDICINE TO HELP THIS RIGHT NOW OF COURSE THEIR OTHER THINGS TOO USE BEHAVIOUR OF CHANGES FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT BUT THERE'S BUT THERE'S A CECLEAR BY A LOGICAL ROLE JUST LIKE WESE MEDICINE TO STOP SEIZURES RIGHT BU PEOPLE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THET NOT SUPERSLEP DEPRIVE THERE'S ANOTHER PART TO IT TOO WE CAN USE MEDICINE TO PREVENT BY POLLAR EPISODES BUT THERE'S ANOTHER PART OF SELF CARE INVOLVE TOO BUT IT'S IT'S A ROLE OF MEDICINE RIGHT JUST AS IF ANXIETY LEVELS AREN'T COMING DOWN TOO MUCH SAFE FOR THE PERSON TO GET AT THE DRAMA RIGHT THEY KNOW THERE'S A DRAMA THEY'VE TALKED AROUND IT YOU KNOW FOR TWENTY YEARS THEY KNOW IT'S BEEN IMPACKING THEM THEY'RE NOT SURE HOW IT'S HARD TO GO THERE THE'RE WITH A TRUSTED THERAPISS BUT IT'S STILL ARD TO PUT WORDS TO IT AND NOW YOU KNOW THER MAY BE HAVE ING A PANIC ATTACK RIGHT IN THE LOCAEETS WE CAN USE MEDICINES TO TAKE THE TEMPERATURE DOWN TO TO SUIT OF E YOU EASE THAT PERSONS WAYFUL WORD SO THAT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND SOMETHING RIGHT THAT THEN PROVIDES O RESOLUTION IN THAT PART OF THE PILLAR AND THEN THE OW THINGS ARE SET IN A BETTER PLACE SO SO THE BIOLOGICAL ASPECT YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY WHERE WERE TALKING ABOUT MEDICINES HAS ITS PLACE BUT THE IDEA THAT MEDICINES ARE A SUBSTITUTE FOR UNDERSTANDING MAKES NA SENSE WELL YOU'VE PROVIDED US AN INCREDIBLE FRAMEWORK THANK YOU THIS FRAMEWORK REALLY SPEAKS TO ALL OF US IT YOU KNOWN THAT THE COMPONENTS THAT MAKE US WHO WE ARE YON THE DOES YOU WHAT IT THE STRUCTURE OF THE SELF YOU KNOW EVERYTHING FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND CONSCIOUS MY DEFENSE MECHANISM'S CHARACTER STRUCTUREERSELF AND THE FUNCTIONS OF SELF YOU ON THESE COMPONENTS OF SELF AWARINESS DEFENSE MECHANISM'S REACHING UP FROM THAT ICEBURG UNDER THE WATER WHAT WE PAY ATTENTION TO OUR BEHAVIOUR RS AND HOFLE ARE STRIVINGS AND SENSE OF HOPE AND HOW THOSE TWO PILLARS FLOW UP INTO EMPOWERMENT HUMILITY AGENCY AND GRATITUDE AGAIN AS ACTION TERMS AS ACTIVE TERMS AND EVENTUALLY TO PEACE CONTENTMENT AND DELIGHT IN THIS NOTION OF GENERATIVE DRIVE AS WELL AS SOME OF THE PITFALLS AND AND A CHALLENGES THAT CAN PULL DOWN ON GENERATIVE DRIVE AR A CLUDE GENERATIVE DRIVE AND YOU VERY CLEARLY POINTED US TO WHERE WE SHOULD ALL LOOK IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING OURSELVES BETTER AND WHERE WE COULD DO BETTER AND BE BETTER IN THE WORLD BECAUSE THIS IS A SERIES WE HAVE THE WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO IM HAVE YOU TELL US EVEN MORE ABOUT HOW THIS STRUCTURE PLAYS OUT BOTH IN TERMS OF ITS HEALTHY EXPRESSION AND IN TERMS OF ITS UNHEALTHY EXPRESSION KNOW INDIFFERENT A PATHOLOGIC CONDITIONS THAT  MOST OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH AT LEAST IN NAME AND AND I AM SURE YOU ARE GOING TO TELL US MORE ABOUT NO WHAT THE WHAT THE REAL IM BOTH UNDER PINNINGS AND EXPRESSIONS OF THINGS LIKE NARCISISM AND IN NO EXTREME AND MILD FORM AM YOU KNOW ANXIETY IN ITS EXTREME AND MILD FORMS AND AN ALSO SOME OF THE A THE NAMES AND DIAGNOSES THAT WERE MORE FAMILIAR WITH HEARING ABOUT SUCH AS  BY POL OR DISORDER OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE THINGS OF THAT SORT A BUT THAT ALL RELATE BACK TO AND AND REALLY ARE NESTED IN THIS STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF SELF AND WHERE IT CAN ALL GO SO AM FIRST WALL I WANT TO SAY AND THANK YOU REALLY AN IMMENSE THANK YOU FOR FOR SO WELCOME FOR DEFINING THE STRUCTURE AND MAKING IT SO CLEAR TO TO ME INTO EVERYBODY ELSE AND AND AS YOU SAID IT IT HAS ITS COMPLEXITY THERE IS IN FACT IMMENSE COMPLEXY DOWN THERE AT THE BOTTOM BUT THAT FLOWS UP FROM COMPLEX TO TO VERY SIMPLE IDEALS AND AN A RODE MAP TO GET THERE AND AGAIN THE PEDIOPIS AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE AS AS A LINK IN THE SHOWNUP CAPTIONS  SHOULD THEY WANT TO SEE THIS IN VISUAL FORM I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ASSEMBLING THE STRUCTURE NOT JUST AS A TUTORIAL BUT BECAU S AT LEAST TO MY KNOWLEDGE NO SUCH STRUCTURE WERE SUMMARY OF THESE STRUCTURES IT EXISTS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND CERTAINLY NOT IN ANY FORM THAT THE THE NONCLINATION AND NOT YOU KNOW HIGHLY TRAINED PSYCHIATRIS I COULD EVER ACT AS OR UNDERSTAND SO THIS IS BOTH AN IMMENSE RESOURCE AND IMMENSE GIFT TO US ALL THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH YOU SO WELCOMAND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME E WHICH IS A GIFT TO BE CONTINUED IN THE NEXT EPISODE THANK YOU THANK YOU

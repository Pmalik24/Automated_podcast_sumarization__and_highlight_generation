WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAPONE DSCU SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TO  LI I MANDER HUBERMAN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICIN TO DAY MY GUEST IS DOCTOR SUZANNA SOBERG DOCTOR SUSANNA SOBERG COMPLETED HER DOCTORAL THESIS WORK AT THE CENTERE OF INFLAMMATION AND METABOLISM AND THE CENTERE FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY RESEARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF COPENHIGGEN IND DENMARK HE RESEARCH AS FOCUSED ON HOW DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE CAN BE USED TO ENHANCE HUMAN METABOLISM SHE IS THE FIRST AUTHOR OF A SEMINAL STUDY WHICH DISCOVERED THE MINIMUM THRESHOLDS FOR DELIBERATE HEAT AND DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE FOR INCREASING BROWN FAT THERMOGENISIS WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A MODE OF INCREASING HEAT PRODUCTION AND METABOLISM IN THE BODY AND FOR ESTABLISHING ACTIONABLE PROTOCALS THAT CAN BE USED OUTSIDE OF THE LABORATORY TO IMPROVE METABOLISM AND HUMAN HEALTH DOCTOR SOBER'S RESEARCH WAS PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL SELL REPORTS METABOLISM IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE ADDING TO A LONG AND IMPORTANT HISTORY OF RESEARCH FOCUSING ON THE ROLL OF COLD AND THE ROLL OF HEAT IN ALTERING VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE BODY'S PHYSIOLOGY INCLUDING HORMON HEALTH METABOLISM AND CHANGES AN NARROW TRANSMITTERS SUCH AS DOPAMINE AND EPINEFRAN IN FACT TO DAY'S DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR SOBERG FOCUSES ON THE ROLL OF DELIBERATE HEAT AND DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE ON METABOLISM BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECTS OF COLD AND HEAT ON THINGS LIKE NARROW TRANSMITTER PRODUCTION NAMELY DOPAMINE AND EPINEPRAN AND NOREPINE FROM THE SO CALL CATA COLAMINES WHICH STRONGLY IMPACT MOOD AND METABOLISM IN ADDITION DOCTOR SOBERG ANSERCH MANY COMMON QUESTIONS ABOUT DELIBERATE COLD AND DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE INCLUDING FOR INSTANCE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COLD SHOWERS VERSES COLD IMMERSION UP TO THE NECK VERSES TOTAL BODY COLD IMMERSION INCLUDING WHETHER NOT GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN HEAT AND COLD CHANGES FUNDAMENTALLY THE WAY THAT HEAT AND COLD IMPACT THE METABOLISM HORMONES AND NEURO TRANSMITTER PRODUCT ION AND WE TALK ABOUT ALMOST EVERY SINGLE NUANTS AND VARIATION ON DELIBERATE COLD AND DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE PROTOCALS AS IT RELATES TO THE UNDERLYING SCIENCE IN PARTICULAR HOW COLD RECEPTORS THAT THE LEVEL OF THE SKIN ARE IMPACTED VERSES COLD RECEPTION AND PERCEPTION AT THE LEVEL OF THE BRAIN AND HOW ALL OF THAT IMPACT SYSTEMS OF THE BRAIN EMBODY RELATING TO MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE BASED ON HER SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND ACADEMIC TRAINING AS WELL AS HER UNDERSTANDING AND USE OF DELIBERTE HEAT AND DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE PROTOCALS DOCTOR SOBERG IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING EXPERTS ON THESE TOPICS IN FACT SHE IS THE AUTHOR OF A RECENT BOOK ENTITLED WINTER SWIMMING WHICH IS I HAVE TO SAY A TERRIFIC BOOK BECAUSE IT BREAKS DOWN CHAPTER BY CHAPTER THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF DELIBERATE HEAT AND DELIBERATE COLD INTO ITS VARIOUS CONSTITUENT PARTS INCLUDING COLD ACLAMIZATION THE COLD SHOCK RESPONS DANGERS AND SAFETIES OF COLD WATER THE IMPACT OF COLD AND IMPACT OF HEAT ON VARIOUS ASPECTS OF HUMAN HEALTH AS WELL AS SPECIFICS RELATING TO SANAVERSES ICE VERSES COLD SWIMMING SHOWERS ET CETERA IT'S A VERY THOROUGH READ IN A VERY EASY AND ACCESSIBLE READ THAT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN DELIBERATE COLD ARE DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE ERE BOTH WILL ALLOW YOU TO EMBRACE THOSE PROTOCOLS WITH THE GREATEST DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO OBTAIN THE SPECIFIC AND POINTS THAT YOUARE INTERESTED IN AND TO DO SO SAFELY BEFORE WE BEGIN I LIKE EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATEFOR MY TEACHING AN RESEARCH ROLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRON EFFORTS TO BRING ZERO COSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TODAYS TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENTS ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND PATASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR OF DOCT MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLYTES FOR NERV R SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIA MANESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IFHYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMON SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE PROPARATIOS OF ELECTROLYTES IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENTE DOCAM SLASH HUBERMENT AND YOU'L GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THEY'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENTE DOCAM SLASH HUBERMAN FODCAST AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR SUSANNA SOBERG DOCTOR SUSANNA SOBERG WELCOME THANK YOU SO GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE I FEEL LIKE I SHULD GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF THE BACK STORY OF HOW WE GOT CONNECTED WHICH WAS THAT FOR MANY YEARS I'VE BEEN INTERESTED IN  COLTHERMAGENISIS IT WAS THE TOPIC OF MY SENIORISTY ASSYSTAN COLLEGE AND I'F OF COURSE FOLLOWED THE A POPULARITY OF WIMHOFF AND WE'VE HAD DOCTOR CRAG HELLER MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIOLOGY DEPARTMENT AT STAMFORD WHO WORKS ON COLD AND IT'S IMPACTD ON PHYSIOLOGY AND SPORTS PERFORM AIT SO FOR A LONG TIME I'VE BEEN INTERESTED IN THIS AREA BUT THERE'S BEEN A REAL A LACK OF NEW LET'S SAY HIGH PROFILE QUALITY SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION IN TERMS OF HOW FOR INSTANCE COLD PLUNGE IS AND SANA HOW THAT IMPACTS HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME INFORMATION OUT THERE BUT IT'S BEEN SORT OF SCATTERED AND THEN LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO I SEE THIS PAPER IN SELL REPORTS MEDICINE AND WAS IMMEDIATELY STRUCK AN THE FIRST OFALL THE FACT THAT IT WAS IN CELL REPORTS MEDICINE I'VE BEEN ON THE SEL PRESSOD EDITO RYALBOARD FOR A LONG TIME NOW SO AS JOURNALS ARE OF COURSE PHENOMENAL JOURNALS AND THE TITLE AND THE CONTENT OF THE PAPER WAS DIRECTLY IN LINE WITH THE SORTS OF PRACTICES THAT PEOPLE ARE VERY CURIOUS ABOUT AND THEN ARE STRIVING TO EMERGE THINGS LIKE SAWN A COLD PLUNGES AND THERE WAS YOUR NAME FIRST ON THE AUTHOR LIST AND I REASHOUT YOU THROUGH SOCIA MEDIA AND WE'VE DONE A LITTLE BIT OF LIVE CONTENT THERE TOGETHER AND I'VE BEEN TRACKING WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF YOUR BOOK AND TALKING ABOUT THE RESULTS IN YOUR MANUSCRIPT AND TALKING ABOUT THE SCIENCE AND IMPACT OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND SOONA AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT'S BEEN A WONDERFUL AND REMARKABLE THING TO SEE AND YOUR BRINGING SO MUCH QUALITY INFORMATION ABOUT THIS AREA THAT FOR A LONG TIME I THINK IT WAS KIND OF NICHE AND IS NOW BECOMING MORE AND MORE MAINSTREAM SO I'M IN A START OFF WITH A THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND A THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE AND I'M LOOKING FOR TO TALKING TO YOU ABOUT IT TO DAY SO MY FIRST QUESTION I'M TO GET THINGS STARTED IS WHAT IS HAPPENING WHEN WE GET INTO AN UNCOMFORTABLY COLD ENVIRONMENT SO FOR INSTANCE IF I'M REALLY HOT ON A HOT DAY JUMPING INTO A COLD POOL FEELS REALLY GOOD BUT IF I'M ALREADY KIND OF I AT ROOM TEMPERATURE I'M A LILE BIT CHILLY GETTING INTO THAT SAME TEMPERATURE OF WATER DOESN'T FEEL SO GOOD RIGHT THERE'S A SHOCK THERE SO IF YOU COULD JUST WALK US THROUGH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE GET INTO UNCOMFORTABLY COLD WATER WHETHER NOT IT'S BY WAY OF SHOWER OR COLD PLUNGE AT THE LEVEL OF OUR PHYSIOLOGY AND IF YOU'D LIKE OUR PSYCHOLOGY I THINK THAT'S A GOOD PLACE FOR US TO START BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL ORIENT PEOPLE TO THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE IF THEY DO THAT AND FOR THOSE THAT HAVEN'T DONE IT IM MIGHT START TO PEEL BACK SOME OF THE THE LAYERS AS TO WHAT THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS OF COLD ARE YE THANK YOU FOR THAT CUISTION IT'S PRETTY GOOD SUGJESTAGDREST WHAT I TUALLY HAPPENS IN OUR PHYSIOLOGY WHEN WE GET COLD AND YOU CAN GET COLD IN MANY WAYS SAY YOU CAN JUST HEAT OUT THOUGH THE ONE TI GIVES YOU THE MOST POTENTEST TRESSER WHICH IS SUBMERCING INTO COL WATER AND BUT YOU COULD ALSO GO IN OUTSIDE IN THE COL WIND THAT'S ALSO GON A EXIVATE YOUR AN YOU SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM SO GET ALL THESE NEUATERANCS MENT AF GOING IN YOUR BODY AND SO YOU YOU CATACOLA MINES AN LET'S JUST ADDRESS THAT WE ARE TAKING A COL PLUNGE FOR EXAMPLE SO IF YOU ARE VERY HOT FOR EXAMPLE AN BEFORE YOU GO INTO THE COAT IS GONG O FEEL LESS IS GOING TO FEEL LESS TRESS WOT WHAT THE THE TEMPERATURE A DIFFERENCE FROM YOUR SKIN TO THE COLD IS DEFINITE GOIN ANT GIVE YOU A A SHOCK BUT YOUR COL TEMPERATURE IS WARMER AND THAT'S GOING O FEEL A LIVE A BETTER SO THAT'S WHY WHEN PEOPLE GOINTO SANA FOR XEMBL AND GO OUT AN IN INTO THE COL WATER THEY THEY THEY CAN DO IT EASILY A YE SEE ARE THEN IF THEY WERE COLD BEFOREHAND COULD I AS IM ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS SO YOU YOU MENTION THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH FOR A PEOPLE LISTENING WHO AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH THAT IS THE THE BRANCH OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING EXCELERATIONS AND HEART RADES A FEELINGS OF ALERTNESS IT'S ACCOMPANIED WITH STRESS AND THE STRESS RESPONSE BUT IT'S ACCOMPANIED WITH WAKING UP IN THE MORNING FOR THAT MATTER SO IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT STRESS AND THN YOU MENTION THE CATACOLAL MEANS WHICH EM OUR DOPMEAN EPAN EFFEREN AND NOR UP AND EFFEREND SO MAYBE A LO IT LATER WILL TALK ABOUT THOSE INDIVIDUAL NOR TRANSMITTERS BUT YOU RAISE A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT WHICH IS SOMETHING I GET ASKED ABOUT A LOT FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE CURIOUS ABOUT USING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE WHICH IS HOW COLD SHOULD THE WATER BE AND I KNOW IT'S VERY HARD TO GIVE A STRAIGHT PRESCRIPTION FOR THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT BOILS DOWN TO WHAT YOU JUST SAID WHICH IS IT'S REALLY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR CURRENT TEMPERATURE AND REALLY THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SURFACE OF YOUR SKIN AND THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER SO IF YOURE VERY WARM GETTING INTO COLD FEELS GOOD IF YOU ALREADY COLD GETTING INTO MORE COLD FEELS STRESSFUL A IS THERE ANY WAY THAT WE CAN START TO GAUGE WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO APPROACH A DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE PROTOCOL IMSHOULD IT FEEL LE UNCOMFORTABLE AND THAT LEADS IN THE QUESTION OF HOW DO WE BALANCE THE DISCOMFORT WITH THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE SPEND IN SO FOR INSTANCE IF IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE WE'LL SPENDING MORE TIME IN THE COLD GET US THE SAME BENEFIT AS GETTING INTO VERY UNCOMFORTABLY COLD WATER FOR A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME YET T IS REALLY GOOD QUESTION AND I DENT NOTLY THINK THAT THIS COULD BE AND FUTURE STUDIES ON THIS AS WELL SO REALLY UNRAVEL A WHAT KIND OF PROTOCOSE IT ARE THE ARE THE BEST WAY OR ALSO FOR WHICH OUT COMES OF COURSE SO IF THE TEMPERATURE IS A VERY COLD AND YOU FEEL THAT AT YOU ALSO FEEL VERY COLD THEN YOU CSE TOULD STAY IN THE WATER A A BIT LONGER S I THINK IT'S JUST YOU SHOULD GET UNCOMFORTABLE COLD SO AS LONG AS YOU GET UNCOMFORTABLE COLD IT'S COLD ENOUGH AND YOU GET THIS WHAT WE CALLD THE COLD SHOCKS TO THE COSUK IS ACTIBATION OF YOUR SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND DESAY ACTIBATION OF THE THE CATACOLA MINDS WITH YOU JUST MENTION BEFORE JOS THE SHOCK MEAN THAT I'M HAVING TROUBLE CONTROLLING MY BREATHIN IS AT A GOOD GAGE I YE YOU CAN SAY SO BECAUSE THAT'S CAN ALIKE HOW WE DEFINE IT SO YOU HIGH POVINSULATE SO YOU HAVE A FASTER AND A BREATHING RATE AND SO THAT INCREASES ALSO BECAUSE YOU ACTIBATE YOUR GASPING REFLECTS IF YOU ARE NEW TO THIS AND BUT IF YOU ARE ADAPT IT IT I KIND OF SUBSIDES WITH TIME I WITH AADAPTATION SO WHAT YOU CAN DO IS THAT YOU CAN TRAIN THIS COLD EXPOSURE AND YOU CAN CANNALIKE GET ADAPTED TO IT SO YOU DON'T HAPE THIS HIGH POVINSILATING RESPONSE EVERY TIME YOU GO OUT IN THE COLD WATERS THIS IS LIKE BUILDING UP YOUR RACILIENS BUILLING BUILDING UP YOUR ADAPTATION IS GONA MAKE THI SHOCK LIKE SUBSIDE A BIT SO IS IT'S ALWAYS HARDER IN THE BEGINNING BUT YOU SHOULD DO HARD THINGS RIIT I'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE YOU SHOULDN'T THINK ABOUT COLD WATER AND COLD WERE IMMERSION AS SOMETHING THAT IS COMFORTABLE IU SHOULD BE HARD BECAUSE THAT'S THE POINT OF IT RINT IF YOU ENJOY IT THEN YET THEN I'M I'M THINKING SOMETHING ISWRONG I'S NOT R YOU SID NOT AN GEIT FOR THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT YOU'RE MAKING BECAUSE I THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE SHY AWAY FROM DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE BECAUSE IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE IN A WAY THAT AT LEAST FROM MY EXPERIENCE IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE DISCOMFORT OF EXERCISE BECAUSE WITH EXERCISE FOR INSTANCE UM IF RUNNING HAR IN A RUNNING FAST AND BREATHING HARD IS UNCOMFORTABLY CAN SLOW DOWN OR WALK IF UM YOU KNOW LIFTING WEIGHTS IS UNCOMORTABLE YOU CAN REMOVE SOME WEIGHT OR PRODUCED THE NUMBER OF REPETITIONS OR STOP WITH DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE I SUPPOSE YOU CAN BE SORT OF HALF WAY IN HALF WAY OUT OF THE WATER OR PARTIALLY UNDERNEATH THE COLD SHOWER BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO TIGH TRATE AN ADJUST THE LEVEL IT'S AN OF ALL OR NONE AND I'VE SEEN UM I SHOULDJUST I CAN TELL THIS BY ANECDOTE I AVE DONE SOME WORK WITH MILITARY SPECIAL OPERATIONS UM I WON'T SAY WHICH COUNTRY THIS WAS OUTSIDE THE YOU ASK UM AND THESE ARE VERY TOUGH INDIVIDUALS THERE USED TO GOING WITHOUT SLEEP AND DOING HARD HIGH CONSEQUENCE HIGH RISK KIND OF WORK AND THEY WERE ASKED TO DO SOME COLD WATER EXPOSURE TRAINING AND I WAS THERE THAT DAY AND IT WAS REMARKABLE ABOUT A THIRD OF THEM JUST WENT STRAIGHT IN ANS CONE OF GRINDED THROUGH IT YOU KNOW LAKE THEY LOOKED STOIC ANYWAY TO ME UM THERE WERE A FEW WHIMPERS NO CRIES ABOUT A THIRD UM TALKED A LOT AND GOT REALLY YOU COULD TELL THAT THEY WERE AGITATED AND ANXIOUS BUT T HE MADE IT THROUGH AND THEN ABOUT A THIRD OF THEM JUST SIMPLY WOULD NOT GET IN PASS THEIR KNEES OR FIES WE'RE JUST IT SEEME LIKE THEY WERE JUST DREADING THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE SOME I SHE DIDN'T ASHALLY GO IN COMPLETELY UM WHICH WAS REALLY SURPRISING TO ME AND THAT YOU COULDN'T TELL BASED ON THEIR PHYSICAL APPEARANCE WOR ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT THEM THE'R ALL HIGH PERFORMERS AS TO WHO WOULD HAVE THIS RESPONSE SO SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE VERY TREMENDOUSLY IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO EMBRACE THE DISCOMFORT OF THE COLD IS THAT FROM YOUR STUDIES IS AT YOUR EXPERIENCE AS WELL OR OR THERE THE WEIRD MUTINTS WHO SEEM TO JUST LOVE GOING INTO THE COLD FOR THE FIRST TIME SO SOME PEOPLE JUST FEEL BETTER IN THE COLD AND SOME PEOPLEARE DREAD THE COLD EVEN MORE AND YU CAN SAY THE MORE PEOPLE ARE PUSHING THE COLD AWAY THEY MIGHT FEEL THE COLD PAIN EVEN MORE SO THEY THEY THEY WOULD DEFINITELY PEOPLE WHO ARE MAY BE THE SOLDIERS YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT THEY SOME OF THEM MIGHT BE ALREADY ADAPTED TO THE GOLD COLD SO IF THEY ARE NOT SCARED OF THE COLD THEY GO OUT AND THEY EMBRACE THE COLD IN A BETTER WAY IT COULD ALSO BE THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE A MORE SENSITIVE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND WHEN YOU ARE BUT SENSITIVE TO THE COLD YOU OF COURSE TRY TO GET A AWAY FROM IT RIOT AND YOU WIL ALSO HAVE THE COLD PAIN MORE AND FEEL THE COL PAIN MORE IF THEY IF IF YOU AVOID IT SO THE MORE YOU A BOY AT THE COLD THE THE MORE PAIN PAINFUL IT WILL FEEL AND WHEN YOU GO INTO IT SO YE YOU MENTION BEING OUTSIDE IN A TEA SHIRT VERSES AND COLD IMMERSION UP TO THE NECK WERSES SHOWER I THINK AND THIS IS SOMETHING A LOT OF PEOPLE WONDER ABOUT WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF IMPACT SHORT TERM AND PERHAPS EVEN LONG TERM BETWEEN COLD SHOWERS COLD PLUNGE TO THE NECK SO I COULD BE AN ICE WATER  JUST VERY COLD WATER A IMMERSION WITH DUNKING ONE'S HEAD AND THEN COMING UP BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU W OGE TO COME UP FRARE AT SOME AND THEN SIMPLY BEING OUTSIDE ON A COLD DAY IN SHORTS IN THA TEA SHIRT OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT SO THE DIFFERENT OUTCOMES AND BECAUSE THER THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT E EXPOSURES OF THE COLD TO YOUR COL RECEPTRS IN YOUR SKIM SO THEM MORE YOU CAN SAY YOU COVER YOUR BODY IN THE COLD WHICH YOUD DO IN COLD WATER BECAUSE THEYRE OF COURSE COVER TOTALLY AND THEN AND THE MOLECULES ATE A CLOSETO YOUR SKIM YOUWILD HAVE A MORE CODENT AND EXHIBATION OF ALL YOUR COLT ERECEPTORS IN THE SKIM SO THAT ONE WILL DEFINITELY ACTIVATE YOUR ORENO ANOMOUS A NERVOUS SYSTEM MORE AND RAPID E KE COMPARED TO GOING OUT IN A TEASHIRT IN THE COLD WIND JUST GO FOR WALK AND BUT THAT IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT'S GONE ACTIVATE YOUR A SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM MEANING THEM THAT YOU WU HAVE AN INCREASE IN NOOR PENEFERAN E AND YOU WELL ACTIVATE SOMETHING COLD I TH THE BROWN FAT SO THIS IS A HEALTHY KIND OF A FAT TISSUE THAT WE HAVE IN OUR BODY AND WHEN YOU ACTIVATE THAT THAT SCONNER AN INCREASE YOUR METAPOLISM BEFORE E TUREABOUT BROWN FAT AND I'M SO GLAT YOU BROUGHT IT UP AM BECAUSE SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT THERE WHAT ABOUT COLD SHOWER IVIN OBVIOUSLY COSHOR SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN  AM BEING OUT OUTSIDE IN THE AIR COLD AR VERSES AR BEING IMERSED UP TO THE NECK IF WE HAD MORE STUDIES AN UN COL SHOWERS WE WOULD LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW DOES THAT ACTIVATE ON METABOLISM HOW DOES THAT INCREASE OR AND NOURITROUS MEDIS IN THE BRAIN WHICH COULD ALSO HAVE AN IMPECT OUR ON OUR MENTAL A BALANCE SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING FOR THE FUTURE AND BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS FROM FROM A FROM ECTIVATING BROWN FAT AND  BOTH FROM RODENSTOWED A STUDIES BUT ALSO IN INHUMANS IS THAT AS SOON AS WE GET COLD ON OUR SKIN WE WIL ACTIVATE OUR BROWN FAT SO IT IS CANNALIKE OUR FIRST RESPONDER IN IN THE BODY TO KEEP I OUR AN TEMPERATURE UP SO OUR MUSCLES IS LIKE THE SECOND TISSUE IN OUR BODY  TWO TISSUES WHICH CAN INCREASE OUR ETHEMAGENASIS SO THE BROWN FAT WHICH IS LIKE ALWAYS LIKE TEMPERATURE REGULATING OUR BODY AND THEN WE HAVE A THE THE MUSCLES WHICH WILL SECONDARLY A STOP TO SHIVER AND THATS GONNER INCREASE OUR AN TEMPERATURE IN THE BODY BUT AS SOON AS YOU GO INTO A COL SHOWER YOU WILL ACTIVATE YOUR BROWN FAT A ALSO IMMEDIATELY SO IT COULD BE GOOD ALSO FOR INCREASING ESTABLISHM IN THEORY BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T REALLY ANY STUDIES SHOWING HOW MUCH DOES ACTUALLY ACTIVATE THE BROWN FAT SO IF SOMEONE OUT THAT ONCE TO GEST THINK I THOUGHT ABOUT WHY THERE FEWER STUDIES OF COLD SHOWERS AND COLD IMMERSION AND I THINK THE ANSWER TO MY MIND IS THAT FROM A METHODOLOGICAL STANDPOINT IS JUST HARDER TO DO BECAUSE IF PEOPLE ARE GETTING INTO COLD WATER UP TO THE NECK THEY'RE GETTING INTO COLD WATER UP TO THE NECK WERE AS IF PEOPLE ARE GETTING INTO A COLD SHOWER SOME PEOPLE ARE LARGER SMALLER SOME PEOPLE AR GANT STAND UNDER THE SHOWER WITH IT HITTING THEIR HEADS SOME PEOPLE ABACK O THE NECK YOU COULD DIRECT PEOPLE TO DO IT BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT UM MORE DIFFICULT ALSO I THINK OF FOR YOU AND I ARE BOTH RESEARCH SCIENTIST THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A UM METHE LOGIC COLD SHOLLENGE THAT MIGHT SEEM SILLY TO PEOPLE BUT IT'S A REAL ONE WHICH IS IF PEOPLE ARE IN A COLD SHOWER ALSO THE WATER IS GOING TO BE 'M KIND OF PUSHING THEIR CLOTHING AGAINST THEIR SKIN THERE'S A CERTAIN VULNERABILITY AND A FOR MOST PEOPLE AM COMING TO A LABORATORY IN THE FIRST PLACE LET ALONE BEING ABSORBED WHILE THEY SHOWER AT RAS WHEN YOU GET INTO COLD IMMERGE IN COLD IMMERSION YOUE YOURE GETTIN UNDER THE WATER AND THAT YOU KNOW SOME PEOLE MIGHT ROLL THEIR EYES AND SAILICATE REALLY IS THAT THE BARRIER BUT YOU KNOW SCIENCE EXISTS IN THESE REAL WORLD CONTECTS AND THIS'LL VERY BY COLTURE AND THINGS OF THAT SORT BUT WE RUN HUMAN SUBJECTS IN MY LAB ANDI'LL TELL YOU JUST AM THE PROCESS OF GETTING PEOPLE TO LABORATORY AND HAVING THEM PARK AND FIND THE LAB AND YOU KNOW IT'S A WHOLE NEW ENVIRONMENT WITH PEOPLE IN LAB COTS AND PEOPLE MOVING AROUND AND WHERE'S THE REST R ME MITS THERE'S THERE'S A CERTAIN AMONT OF STRESS JUST ASSOCIATE WITH TAKING PART IN A STUDY FOR MOST HUMAN SUBJECTS SO A I A TOLLLY AGREE HOWEVER WE NEED MORE STUDIES OF OF COLD SHOWERS IT'S JUST A HARDER ENVIRONMENT TO CONTROL A IN MY IN MY MIND SO IT SOUNDS LIKE ANY FORM OF COLD TO THE SKIN THAT PEOPLE REGISTER AS WHAT YOU CALL THA COLD SHOCK OR AN UNCOMFORTABLE LIKE I LIKE THIS IS KIND OF A JAWRING ACTIVATES THE BROWN FAT DO WE KNOW WHAT THE PATHWAY IS FROM COLD RECEPTORS ON THE SKIN TO THE BROWN FATOMIND HOW DOES THE BROWN FAT KNOW THAT WE'RE COLD REAY GOOD QUESTION AND IT SEEMS THAT I I THINK THAT OF COURSE IN THE FUWTURE WWILL KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT THESE PATHWAYS BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT IT THE COLERSCEPTERS WILL SEND A SIGNAL TO OUR TEMPATO REGULATING CENTRE AND IN THE BRAINS THE H THELAMUS AND AND THAT SGONER BE AM THE TAKING IN THIS MESSAGE AND WE HAVE SO MANY COPERCEPTORS IN THE SKIN SO IT'S GOING TN BE VERY FAST AS YOU CAN SAY IF YOU EMERGE THE BODY INTO COL WATER THIS IS GOING O BE SO RAPID A SO IT WILL HAVE A RABBIT INCREASE IN A NO TRANSMITTERS IN THE BRAINTON NORA DRANOLAN AT DRENOIN COTISOOL AND A WHICH IS NOT THAT MUCH BUT IT'S BUT IT'S STILL THERE SO YOU W HAVE THIS INCREASE IN A NOR A DRANOLINE WHICH WILL THEN IMMEDIATELY ACTIVATE THE BROWN FAT AN BECAUSE THE YOU CAN SAY THE ACTIVATOR IS THE MOST POTENT ONE COLD AND NOR DRANOLIN  DOES CON ACTIVATE THE BROWN FEPUT THERE IS ALSO A DIRECT PATHWAY FROM THE COPERCEPTRS INTHE SKIN TO THE TO THE BROWN FAT WHICH REALLYS S SHOWS THAT IF BECAUSE OF THESE DIFFERENT PATHWAYS IT SHOWS THAT THAT IT COULD BE THAT THIS TISSUE TO KEEP US WARM AS WAS IS DEVELOPED IN IN OUR EIVOLVEMENT E AS HUMANS TO KEEP US WARM AND TO SAVE US WHENEVER THE TEMPERATURE O ON OUR SKIN VERIS SUGGESTED LITTLE BIT TO KEEP US IN THAT RIHT WHOM OURSTATIC BALANCE SO WE DON'T GET HY POTHERMIC AND BUT ALSO SO WE DON'T GET HY PERTHERMIC BUT BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT THE BROWN FET IS LSO ACTIVATED WHEN WE GET WARMER NOUR SKIN SO IT IS O SO AND MAY BE A TEMPERATURE REGULATOR IN OUR IN OUR BODY BOUR THE PATHWAYS IS DIFFERENT I THINK IT'S ASO A THIRD PATHWAY FROM DAKLY FROM THE MUSCLES SO THE BROWN FEAT IS ALSO ACTIVATED AN EVEN THOUGH THE THE MUSCLES ARE STARTING TO SHIVER SO THERE IS A AN EXTRA PATHWAY THAT WAY TO KEEP OUR EOUR TEMPERATURE UP SO MUSCLES AND BROWN FATER WORKING TOGETHER TO TO KEEP US WARM SO WE DON'T ASUFFER TOO MUCH IN IN THE COL WATER SUPERINTERESTING IN WORD HERE YOU POINTING TUE IS THE EXISTENCE OF THREE PARALLEL PATHWAYS AND THE SOTION A PARALLEL PATWAYS COMES UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN BIOLOGY AS YOU AND I KNOW AND AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT BECAUSE UM AS YOU SAID SO SO ELOQUENTLY THE WHEN SOMETHING IS VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR SURVIVAL OR AND OR EVOLUTION THE BRAIN AND BODY A INSTALL MULTIBLE MECHANISMS FOR IT NOT JUST ONE TAN TO UM AND SO IT SOUNDS LIKE ITS COLD SKIN COLD ON THE SKIN TRIGGERS AND A RESPONSE IN TH HYPOTHOLEMAS WHICH THE NACTIVATES BROWN FAT COLD RECEPTORS IN THE SKIN DIRECTLY TO THE BROWN FAT AND THEN SHIVERING IN THE MUSCLE TO THE BROWN FAT U I WANT TO TALK ABOUT BROWN FAT IN DEPTH AND LEARNE FROM YOU MORE ABOUT BROWN FAT UM BEFORE THAT HOWEVER I WANT O ASK ABOUT SHIVER UM I'VE HEARD THAT SHIVER CAUSES THE RELEASE OF SUCKANATE UM WHICH THEN ACTIVATES THE BROWN FAT IS IT KNOWN WHETHER NOT INDUCING SHIVER IS IMPORTANT AND WHEN SHOULD BE PEOPLE SHIVER I  I'VE GOTTEN INTO COLD PLUNGES AND SHIVERED WHILE I WAS IN THERE AND THEN I'VE ALSO HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF GETTING INTO THE COLD PLUNG YOUR A COLD SHOWER THAN GETTING OUT WHEN EVEN STANDING OUTSIDE ON A WARM DAY AFTER SWIMMING IN A POOL AND THEN STARTING TO SHIVER SO THE SHIVER COMES LATER SO HOW IMPORTANT IS SHIVER AND DOES IT MATTER WHEN SHIVER HAPPENS YI WAS SHIVERING IS S GOOD BECAUSE THAT INCREASES YOUR MATABOLISM AND THAT WAS GOINE TO BURN SOME CALORYS IN YOUR BODY YOU SHOULDN'T BE SO AFRAID OF SHIVERING I THINK BECAUSE DE SHIVERING AS LONG AS YOU DON'T GET TO HIPE WITH THEM I SO IF YOU DON'T IF YOU DON'T SIT IN THE COLD WATER FOOR TOO LONG AND AND WHAT YOU JUST SAT BY SHIVERING AFTER YOU GET UP THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE AFTER DROP SOMETHING COLD AFTER DROP IS WHEN YOUR COL TEMPERATURE IT DECREASES EVEN AFTER YOU GET OUT OF THE COLD WATER AND IT ALWAYS DOES THAT AM YOUR BODY BECAUSE IT W AS SOON AS YOU GET INTO THE COLD WATER A OLD DEY YOUR BLOOD VESSELS HAS GONE A CON STRAICT BECAUSE YOU NEED TO KEEP YOUR THE BLOOD IN YOUR CORE AND AND KEEP YOUR A BITLE OG AND SWARM SO AS SOON AS YOU GET UP THAT THOS BLOOD VESSEL WOULD OPEN AGAIN AND THE ONE BLOOD WOULD FLOW OUT AND GET COLDER AND THEN FLOW BACK AGAIN INTO THE COR AND THAT'S GOIN TO DECREASE THE TEMPERATURE IN YOUR CORE OF COURSE SO THAT'S THE DROP SO THAT'S THE DROP   I O LAD YOU EXPLAIN THAT  HEARD A YEARS AGO WHIMHOFF I HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT THE DROP AND IFORT COLLYS MINE TALK ABOUT THE DROP THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER HEARD IT EXPLAIN CLEAR LIMIN LET ME MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THAS SO A I GET INTO COLD WATER OBVIOUSLY I'M COLD VESSELS CON STRAICT TO KEEP BLOOD NEAR THE CENTERE MY BODY KEEP ME ALIVE I GET OUT THE WARMING UP OF MY BODY ALLOWS THOSE VESSELS AND COPLARIES TO DILATE AGAIN THE BLOOD GOES OUT TO THE SURFACE BUT THE SURFACE IS STILL COLD AND SO THAT BLOOD IS COOLD AND THEN MY COR BODY TEMPERATURE DROPS AND THAT'S WHAT YOUR REFERRING TO AS THE DROP AND THAT'S WHAT INDUCE O SHIVER EXAGRAT AND THEN AM I RIGHT IN THINKING THAT THEN THE SHIVER ACTIVATES BROWN FAT WHICH THEN WARMS ME UP AGAIN YES GOD IS WHY YOU SHOULD END ON THE COLD WE CAN GET BACK TO YELLIS OVER YEENDING ON COLD IS A YOU KNOW IT'S WHAT I REFER TO AS AND WHAT IS NOW BECOME KNOWN AS THE SOBER PRINCIPLE WHICH IS A A REALLY IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF ENDING ON COLD AN AND NOT DOING WHAT I DO WHICH IS TO GET INTO A HOT SHOWER OR EVER BACK IN THE SOUNTO BUT U WILL GET BACK TO THAT IN IT IN A FEW MINUTES SO EM THAT'S WONDERFUL A THAT YOU CAN EXPLAIN THAT SO CLEARLY BECAUSE I THINK THAT SHIVER IS SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DO AVOID PEOPLE THINK O I DON'T WANT THE AND SHATTERING THE TEETH THEN  AM AND FEELS LIKE A LOSS OF BODILY CONTROL WHICH REALLY IT IS IT'S IT'S AN NOD ANOMIC RESPONSE YEBUT I DON'T THINKS THE POPISHOULD SHOULD AVOIDIT THAT MUCH IT'S JUST LIKE SEEING SHIVERING AS AWAY OFF YOUR BODY IN IN A LIHT IT'S TRAINING IT'S TRAINING FOR YOUR FOR YOURSELVES IS TRAINING FOR YOUR MUSCLES IT'S TRAINING UP YOUR METABOLISM AND THAT'S GONT INCREASE YOUR IT WHAT'S CALLED THE INSOLENSENSETIVITY SO IF YOU CAN LIKE IN YOUR MIND IGET DUSE TO THE THOUGHT OF SHIVERING IS JUST LIKE WHEN YOU GO EXERCISING IN THE TRAINING CENTR AND GET THAT FEELING OFF LIKE OF TISIS TOUGH NOW IT HURTS THA LITTLE BIT YET'S GONE A HURT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SHIVERING ALSO DO US BUT IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT WAY OF TRAINING YOURSELLS AND YOUR BODIETS GOING TO CREATE WHAT IS HEALTHY STRESS IS CALLED HOMESIS IN THE CELLS AND THE MORE YOU EXPOSE OURS YOUR MUSCLE CELLS ARE YOUR BROWN FAT CELLS TO THESE KIND OF LIKE HEALTHY STRESSES EXERCISE COLD AND HEAT EXPOSURE IT'S GOIN O MAKE THEM A BETTER AT LIKE EXCIBATING AND ALSO AND AT I KEEPING YOU HEALTHY SO AS LONG AS THE THE CELLS GET EXPOSED TO THIS IT IS GOING TO KEEP THEM ON ITS TOS YOU CAN SAY BECAUSE IT BECOMES MORE RUBBEST AND INCREASING GEASE HEAT YOCK PRODINES AND COLSURE CRUTINES IN THE CELLS TO AND MAKE YOU AND MORE RUBBEST FOR THE NEXT TIME AND THAT IS ALSO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO TO THE TRAINING CENTRE AND I KEEP LIKE TO I DRAWING THAT PARALLYN BECAUS P PEOPLE TO DAY NO MORE ABOUT WIN NO MORE ABOUT EXERCISE AND WHAT THAT'S IS I'S GOING TO DO TO YOUR MUSCLE CELLS AND AND BUT THE SAME KIND OF LIKE TRAINING IS ALSO WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU GO OUT AND AND INTO THE COWATERAN SUBMERG IN TO COL WATER BECAUSE THAT IS JUST YOUR COALT TRAINING CENTER YOU CAN SAND AND ALSO YOUR HEAT TRAININGS END O GOING INTO THE SONA BECAUSE THE CELLS ARE GETTING STRONGER WITH HOMETIC STRESS SO IT'S THE SAME PROCES JUST DIFFERENT PRACTIS I'M SO GLADTH YOU BROUGHT UP THE FACT THAT THE DISCOMFORT OR THE EMBARRASSMENT OR BOTH OF SHIVER IS STILL CRUCIAL TO I SEE TO REACH FOR IN TRY IN EXPERIENCE THE SAME WAY THAT WITH EXERCISE I I THINK A LOT PEOPLE DON'T REALISE IS BUT WHEN WE DID OUR SERIES WITH DOCTOR ANY GALPAN IT BECAN CLEAR TO ME WHAT SHOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN CLEAR TO ME AND I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALISE WHICH IS THAT IF WE WERE TO MEASURE I'M HURT RATE BLOOD PRESSURE I'M STRESS MORMONES AND INFLAMMATION IN A HUMAN BEING DURING EXERCISE IT WOULD LOOK AS IF THEY WERE EADY TO DIE BLOOD PRESSURE WOULD BE HIGH INFLAMMATION AT AT THROUGH THE ROOF BUT ALL OF THAT IS SETTING IN MOTION AN A ADAPTATION OR SET OF ADAPTATIONS THAT ALLOW BLOOD PRESSURE TO BE LOWER AT REST THAT ALLOW A INFLAMMATION MARKERS TO BE LOWER AT REST ALL THE THINGS THAT EVERYBODY IS SEEKING WITH EXERCISE IN INADDITION TO OF COURSE THE ESTHETIC CHANGES THAT PEOPLE ARE SEEKING WITH EXERCISE SOUNDS LIKE THE EXACTING THINGS ARE HAPPENING WITH THE COLD SO AM THE REDUNDANT MESSAGE HERE SEEMS TO BE THAT THE MORE DISCOMFORT PROVIDED IT'S DONE SAFELY JUST LIKE WITH EXERCISE THE MORE SHIVERING THE A'M THE MORE COLD SHOCK PROVIDED IT'S NOT TO THE EXTREME AND STOP SOMEBODY'S HEART I WE CAN TALK ABOUT THRESHOLDS FOR THAT WOLBUT LATER IT SOUNDS LIKE ALL OF THAT IS GOING TO SET IN MOTION SOME LONG TERM CHANGES THAT WILL MAKE PEOPLE FEEL BETTER AND WILL IMPROVE HEALTH COULD YOU JUST TOUCH ON A FEW OF THE LONGER TERM CHANGES THAT ARE KNOWN TO OCCUR I'M WELL AWARE OF THE STUDY SHOWING THAT THING WAS EUROPEAN JOURNAL PHYSIOLOGY IT WAS A EUROPEAN JOURNAL PHYSIOLOGY SHOWING LONG LASTING INCREASES IN CATACOLAMEANS DOPOME NOR UP AND EFFEREN AND A'M EPAN EFFERING FOR MANY HOURS AFTER DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPEN AT THE LEVEL OF METABOLISM AND BROWN FAT IN LET'S SAY THE HOURS IN A DAY AFTER A DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AS SOON AS YOU GO IN OF COURSE THERE 'S THE ECTODATION BUT IT SEEMS NI NO YOUAR ASKING FOR THE THE LATER OUTCOMES LIKE BLOOD PRESSUREN STUFF LIE GAT IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN YOU HAVE BLOOD PRESSURE BUT ALSO INTERMS OF METABOLISM I KNOW THAT OUKNW IN YOUR STUDY YOU SHOULD AND WILL TALK ABOUT BROWN FAT IN DEPTH HERE IN A MOMENT BUT THAT THERE WERE CHANGES TO THE BROWN FAT THAT IT QUAIT TO CHANGES IN FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO BE COMFORTABLE IN CLOLDER ENVIRONMENTS WHEN THEY'RE NOT DOING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE OR IN THE SAME WAY THAT I CAN A EXERCISE ON AN EXERCISE BIKE R GOOUT FOR A HARD RUN BUT THAN IF I GO HIKING A WITH THE FAMILY ON SUNDAY AND WHITS A STEEP CLIME I COULD DO THAT STEEP CLIMB MORE EASILY BECAUSE I'M QUOTENT QUOTE FIT AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE OF H EXERCISE WHAT IS SO A WHAT IR SOME OF THE FITNESS ADAPTATIONS OF THELIBERECALLED EXPOSURE YES SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU YOU GET ADAPTED A LIID EVERY TIME YOU GO SO YOU WILL LIKE EXERCISE GET A LIPET STRONGER SO EVERY TIME YOU GO INTO THE COWATER FOR EVERY TIME YOU WILL BE MORE EXPOSED TURT YOU WIL YOU FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IN THE COAD SO THE YOUWERL GON UGONBUILD YOU ADAPTATION WHICH HAPPENS ON A MIDSABOLIC LEVEL WHICH IS GONTO BE THE BROWN FAT SO WE HAVE MORE ACTIVATION OF YOUR BROWN FET THE MITO CONJUR IN THE THE BROWN FETSELVES ARE GONE A BE AN YOU HAVE MORE OF THOSE AND THEY WILL BE MORE EFFICIENT AT HEEDING YOU UP BECAUSE IT EXPECTS THE BODY EXPECT YOU TO TO DO THIS AGAIN SO YOU ARE PREPARED IN A WAY THE CAPPILARS IN YOUR SKIN IS SAUSICY PEOWILL ALSO BECOME BETTER AT LIKE CONSTRICTING SO YOU WIL HAVE A BETTER SHIELD OF YOUR BODY TO A PREPARE YOU FOR THE NEXT TIME SO O WILL BE BECOME BETTER AT A GOING INTO THE CO WATER IN THAT WAYS O THE THE BODY MAKES THESE MECHANISTMEN CHANGES YOUR BODY IN A WAY SO YOU CAN EXPOSE YOURSELF TO THE NEXT TIME RIGHT AND E AND ALSO YOU WILL HAVE AND ALSO A YOUR AM STREST RESPONSE WILL ALSO BE A SUBSIDE A BITS A YO  HAVE A LESS INCREASE OF YOUR A CATECOLUMINES AN WITH TIME WITH TIME ALSO YOU HAVE BECAUSE OF THIS ACCIVATION OF YOUR A BROWN FATHER YOUR MUSSLS YOU HAVEN'T INCREASE IN THEM A IN IN YOUR METABOLISM WHICH WILL THEN I MAKE YOUR INSOLENT SENTATIVITY A BETTER AND THIS IS SHOWN AND IN STUDIES FOR EXAMPLE AND THERE'S THIS  INTERESTING STUDY I FOUND JUST BEFORE I I STARTED MY PIGSTY WHICH WAS FROM EM GEP OR STOMER AND IT AL FROM TWO THOUSAND AN SIXTEEN WHERE THEY MEASURED AN MITTABILISM NOT IN OR NOT ON BOWN FAT BUT THEY MEASURED INSOLENT SANCETIVITY IN MIDDLE AGE MEN AND WOMEN AT DURING ONE WINTSERS WOMEN SEASON SO THEY WERE NOT VERY YONG LIKE THEY WERE IN MY S STUDY E BUT THEY WERE THER WERE MIDDLE AGE THAN I THINK THIS IS VERY INTERESTING SO THEY IDURING THESE FOUR FIVE MONTHS THEY WERE WHEN TO SWIMMING THEY SAW THAT I HAD A LOW UBRUP PRESSURE AFTER THE CEASON AND I HAD A LOWER HOT RAID AND THEY ALWA SO SO THAT THEY HAVE A BETTER INCELENSTENSITIVITY AND I THINK THAT IS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE IF YOU CAN HAVE A BETTER INCELENSENSITIVITY YOU CAN PREVENT LIFE STYLE  CEASES SO A MAN WE LOWER UBRUP PRESSURE WHICH AS AT VERY STRONG OUTCOME ALSO FOR SELLING HOW MUCH INFLAMMATION TO HAVEIN THE BODY AND BECAUSE T IT DIDN'T MESSURE A BROWN FAT A I FIGUREE THAT IT COULD BE THAT WAS THE MISTING LINK THAT WAS TO ONE OF THE EXPLANATIONS TO WHY WE SEE THIS AM LESS INFLAMMATION IN THE BODY SO A THE LONGER OUT COME SAID THE LONG TURN OUTCOMES COULD BE THAT YOU LOWER YOUR BRUP PRESSURE AND HAVE A LOWER HOT RAID M YOU ALSO M HAVE A BETTER INCELES TANSITIVITY AND A BETTER BLUCOS BALANCE BUT THAT WAS SHOWN THAT IS SOWN IN MY STUDY I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BRAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED A G ONE IS A VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THEREASON Y STORY TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLTIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO ME THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GOT IS VERY IMPORTANT AS POPULATED BY GOT MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE MEAN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE IN LONG TURN HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIOTICS IN ATHLETIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLTIC GREENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTIGENS VITEMENTS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THA ALL MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTE GRAP IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUMORMAN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO  MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD AN THE CAR ON THE PLAN ET CETERA AND THEY'L GIVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMIN D THREE K TOO AGAIN THAT'S A LET IC GREENS DOT CALM SLASH HUMERMAN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY A VITEMIND THREE K TO IT WELL GET BACK TO THE A INSOLENT SENSITIVITY IN GLUCO'S BALANCE I'M THAT'S IT IN AN IMPRESSIVE LIST OF BENEFITS IM OUNO BLOOD PRESSURE OF COURSE MOST PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF BLOOD PRESSURE AN WHAT IT IS IT'S WHAT THE MEASURE WENE WE GO TO THE DOCTOR AND I IT'S NOT VERY SEXY NOWADAYS ON BLOOD PRESSURE PEUS YON BLOOD PRESSURE IT'S NOT YOON'T BE WANTNG HERE ABOUT THE INFLAM AT TOME AND THE MICRO BIOM AND ALL OF THAT STUFF IS REALLY INTERESTING BUT IM I THINK THAT BLOOD PRESSURE DOESN'T GET ENOUGH ATTENTION IM AND WE HAVE SPOKEN TO ON THIS PODCAST TO DOCTOR PETER ATA WHO IM IS AN EXPERT IN LONGEVITY AND HEALTH SPAN AND THINGS OF THAT SORT AND AND I WAS SURPRISE TO LEARN AGAIN I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISE THAT THE NUMBER ON REASON PEOPLE DIE WORLD WIDE IS SREETALE VASCULAR DISEASE AND CARTY OFVASCULAR DISEASE AND THER'RE BUSILY THREE THINGS ON THE LIST OF THINGS TO A DRESS ONE IS NOT SMOKING I'M ORE VAPING BY THE WAY I'M NOT'S GOING THERE ARE FEW OTHER THINGS A RELATE TO BLOOD MARKER'S APOBEIEN THINGS THAT SORT BUT THEN THE BIG ONE IS BLOOD PRESSURE AND SO IT'S IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK ABOUT BLOOD PRESSURE THAT MUCH ANY MORE UM AS A A'S THE KIND OF PEOPLE INTERESTED IN HEALTH OPTIMIZATION AND HEALTH BUT BLOOD PRESSURE IS SO VITAL TO CONTROL SO IT'S WONDERFUL TO HEAR THAT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IS ONE WAY TO CONTROL BLOOD PRESSURE I'M GUESSING IN CONCERT WITH OTHER FORMS OF EXERCISE IM LET'S TALK ABOUT BROWN FAT AND IM IF YOU'D IF YOU'RE WILLING I LIFT TO DRILLIN TO BROWN FAT IT AT A DEEP LEVEL IM AGAIN MY UNDERSTANDING THIS IS IS FAR MORE ELEMENTARY THAN YOURS OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE THE EXPERT MY UNDERSTANDING ABOUT BROWN FAT IS THAT IT'S LO ATAN SPECIFIC AREAS OF OUR BODY I MAYBE MORE WIDESPREAD THAN WHEN I LEARNED AND SCHOOL I THOUGHT IT WAS I WAS THOUGHT IT WAS JUST AT THE CLAPICALS IN THE BACK OF THE NACK AND UPPER BACK BUT WHO KNOWS I LEARN THAT THERE'S MORE OF IT WHEN WE'RE CHILDREN MAYBE MORE DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT OUR BODY AND THAT IT'S RICH IN MITOCONDRIA BUT WHAT IS SO SPECIAL ABOUT THE BROWN FAT LIGE WTIF WE COULD JUST GO INTO THE BIOLOGY BROWN FAN A LITTLE BIT WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE AVE YOU'VE MEASURED IT IN HUMAN SUBJECTS WHERE IS IT DISTRIBUTED REALLY CAN IT EXPAND ITS DISTRIBUTION CAN WE ACTIV ATE AND EXPAND THE AMOUNT OF BROWN FAT AS ADULTS AND AM FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE CRINGING ALREADY THINKING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GETTING FATTER IT'S QUITE THE OPPOSITE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT SUBTUTANEOUS FAT BUT FAT LOCATED AROUND THE THE ORGANS BUT PLEASE EDUCATE ME AM TELL ME WHERE I'M WRONG AND AM EXPAND MY KNOWLEDGE ON BROWN FAT YET YOU ARE NOT WRONG BUT AN IT IS DEFINITELIS TRUE THATE THEY ARE MORE LOCATIONS OF THE BROWN FAT THE THAN WE PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT AN TERE IS THIS VERY NICE TO STUDY FROM TWO THOUSAND AN SEVEN SEEN BY LIGHT NOR AT ELM WHET THEY THEY HAVE MADE THESE SEPETITES A OVERLACS OF AN THEY R SUBJECTS WHET IT CAN SEE WHERE IN THE BODY DO WE HAVE BROWN FAT AND WHERE CAN WE GROW MORE BROWN FAT AN SO TO TAY AM SO THE BROWN FAT IS CAN IS VERY PLATIC SO MEANS THAT IT CAN IT CAN GROW INTOT CAN DECREASE AND DISISPROVEN AN IN STUDIES WHET WE HAVE SEEN AM AND PEOPLE WITH THE FAO CRYO CITOMA IS LIKE A VERY SPECIFIC CANCLETS TYPE WHERE PEOPEWI WERE FROM THE SEVENTIES WHEN WE CAN SEE THAT IF THEY HAVE THE SPECIFIC KIND OF A CANCER TYPE AND THE ABITIT TO HAVE THIS TUMOR ON THEM A A GENERAL GLAND SO THEY HAVE LIKE AN AHUTE INCREASE IN NOI AT DRANDOLEM AND BECAUSE OF THAT  THEY HAVE THIS CONTINUOUS ACTIVATION OF THE BROWN FAT AND THEY HAVE GROWN A LOT OF BROWN FAT IN THE WHOLE BODY EY AR AP DON' KNOW WHERE IT'S LOCATEIN THESE SIX DIFFERENT PLACES BUT IT IS LESS LIKE BET VERY MUCH COMPARETO LIKE NOMAL PEOPLE AND AND WHAT THEY THEN SEE E WHAT WE LEARN FROM THIS STUDY IS THAT BROWN FAT CAN APPARENTY GROW IF YOU HAVE IM AND INCREASE IN NO ATRANALIN THE BODY IT'S NOT LIKE YOU WANT THAT BECAUSE WHEN THAT HAPPENS YOU HAVE A HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE YOU DON'T WANT IT CHRONICALLY RIGOT YOU YOU JUST WANT IT ON LIKE A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME AND THEN IT CAN GROW FORBIT BUT YOU DON'T WANT A CHRONITY OF COURSE NOT BUT BECAUSE IT IT ACTIVATES ALSO YOUR SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SISTEM SO THEY HAVE ALSO SHOWED THEY HAV HIGHBLOW PRESSURE THEY HAD A THEY LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT OF COURSE BECAUSE THIS IS ACTIVATING YOUR METAPOLISM SO THEY THEY FOUND LUCKILY THAT WHEN THEY EY REMOVE THIS BIT  BENIGN A TUMOUR A THAT IT THE BROWN FAT IM DECREASES AGAIN TO NOMAL SIZE AND THEY GAIN WEIT AGAIN AND THEY HAD A NOMOBLOW PRESSURE O THE STORY ANDS WELL BUT THIS CANNOLIKE PROOF OF CONCEPT OF THAT BROWN FAT CAN ACTUALLY GROW SO IT'S PLASTIC IN IT IN ITS WAY OF LIKE IT CAN GROW AND I IT DECREAE AGAIN SO THAT'S VERY GOOD GOOD STUDIES TO TO SEE WHOT IT WHAT THE BODY IS CAPABLE OF BUT WE DON'T OF COURSE WANT ALL THAT BROWN FAT WE JUST WANTED  SOLD BE AM WO JUST WANT TO KEEP IT ACTUALLY AND AND KEEP IT ACTIVATED BECAUSE WHAT WE SEE AND STUDIES IS ALSO THAT AFTER THE AGE OF FORTY AN PEOPLE AM IT THE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THERE ISNAT A SOCIATION WITH HAVING LESS BROWN FAT BUT INCREASE O BECITY SO OF COURSE WE WE DON'T KNOW YET WHETHER IT BROWN FAT DECREASES WITH ASEND THEREFORE WE GET O BES OR WE GET O BEASEN THEREFORE WE HAVE LESS BROWN FAT BUT AS BROWN FAT IS AND INSOLENT SENSITIVE ORCAN IN OUR BODY AND WE GET U BES A JUST LIKE THE MUSCLES GET LESS SENSITIVE AM INSLANC SENSITIVE THE BROWN FAT DOES AS WELL AND THEREFORE IT MAY BE DECREASES IT COULD BE A THEORY THAT I THINK COULD BE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE WE DON'T SEE THAT MUCT BOUND FET AN AN ELDERLY E PEOPLE SOME HAB A LOT THES YOF PEOPLE WORKING OUTSIDE THATHERE AR STUDY SHOWINGNESS WHO  PEOPLE WHO  WIFE OUTSIDE DO PHYSICAL WORK OUTSIDE FARMER MASSAND YET UM THEYOT INTERESTING N Y THINK TO DUST THEMSELVES TO ITS THO DON' DON'T JUST KEEP IT IN THA WAY IT'S UM AND I SUPPOSE WE SHOULD UM CLARIFY FOR PEOPLE IN KISS THEY DON'T KNOW THAT INSOLENT SENSITIVITY IS A VERY GOOD THING YOU WANT THAT YOU WANT YOURSELVES TO BE SENSIVE TO INSOLENT UM INSOLENT INSENSITIVITY IS TYPE TO DIBETIES UM AN IS ASSOCIATE WITH OBSITY UM SUCH AS A POINT OF CLARIFICATION THERE A YE IT'S INTERESTING TO ME I I I USUALLY WORK OUT AT HOME BUT I  GO TO A JIM ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK IF I CAN BECAUSE IT'S GOOD IF I SEE A THE OUTSIDE WORLD U AND THERE ARE A FEW INDIVIDUALS AT THE THE JIM WHO THEY'RE NOT PARTICULARLY LARGE OR MUSCULAR UM BUT THEYARE INCREDIBLY UM LEAN AND THEY'RE POSTURES GREAT PRESUMEBLY FROM THE MUSCOW SKILLITAL WORK U AND THEY THEY'RE IN THEYRE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES AND IT'S REMARKABLE RIGHT N AND UM AND I KNOW ALL THE TELL TELL SIGNS OF PORMON AUGMENTATION I'M VERY GOOD AT SPOTTING THAT OR IF YOU TELL TELL SIGNS I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS ON OTHER POD GASSIN THEY'RE NOT THAT'S NOT WHY THEY THEY'RE THEY'RE UM THEYRE FIT THEY'RE THEY THEY'RE CLEARLY OF THAT LOOK AND YOU SEE THIS AN OUTSIDE THE JIM TOO OF COURSE FOR PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE THEY'VE DONE A LOT OF PHYSICAL LABOR THEY'RE WHOLE LIFE YE THEYRE JUST MOVING A LOT THAT THEY HAVE STRONG HANDS AND FEATURES AND T THEY'RE UM THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY EXCESSIVELY LEAN BUT YOU CAN TELL THAT THEY'VE BEEN USING THEIR MUSCOSELL AL SYSTEM AND I LIKE TO TALK TO THESE PEOPLE NOWSOM LIK NOT WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW FOR YOUR WORK OUT BUT WHAT WHAT DID YOU GROW UP DOING YOU KNOW AND I WOULD SAY IN OBVIOUSLY AVENT RUN STATISTICS ON THIS BUT MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THEM RESPOND THAT THEY DREW UP ON A FARM OR THAT THEY DID SOME SORT OF MANUAL LABOUR OR WERE A POSTMEN OR A POSTWOMAN ORE DOING SOMETHING WHERE THEY MOVED A LOT FOR THEIR EARLIEARS AND THREW OUT MIDDLE AGE AND MOST O THEM ARE NOW IN RETIREMENT BUT SOME OF THEM ARE STILL WORKING AND THEY ALL STILL MOVING A LOT SO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SHIVER AND BROWN FAT MAKE SENSE TO ME BUT IS IT THE CASE THAT AS WERE JUST MOVING AROUND I'M AFEAIRD OF T NEED NON AM EXERCISEIN THESE STHERMO GENISIS SOF WERE JUST MOVING AROUND AM THAT WE ARE ACTIVATING BROWN FAT OR JS DOES THERE NEED TO BE THIS STRESSER DOES THERE NEED TO BE SHIVER AND A COLD STIMULUS OR A HEAT STIMULUS TO ACTIVATE THE BROWN FAT IN OTHER WORDS AM IS JUST THING ACTIVE ENOUGH OR DO WE NEED TO DO SOME SORT OF TEMPERATURE A SHOCK TYPE THING LIKE DELIBERAT COLD EXTHE EXPOSURE YET I THINK THAT IS REALLY GOOD QUESTION BECAUSE HOW HOW WAT SO WHY DO WE HAVE THIS TISSUE THAN IF IT IF IT HAS TO BE EXTREME THEN YOU CAN QUESTION WHAT WHAT WE NEED THIS TISSUE FOR BUT IT SEEMS THAT YOU CAN ACTIVATE THE BROWN FIT WITH JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EXPOSURE TO TO COATS THE CODEST OF THE MOST PODENT STRESS OR ECTIVTOR OF OUR BROWN FAT BECAUSE IT'S OUR TEMPERATURE REGULATING AN ORGAN AND ALBODIS A FIRST RESPONDEN TO THAT SO THE MUSCLES WILL BE A LIIT TOO LATE A AND THAT OR WE HAVE MAY BE THESE TWO KIND OF TISSUES SO EXCELLY IT JUST EXPOSING YOURSELF O O HAND ACTUALLY JUST TO COL WATERS THE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN AND THAT IF YOU JUST PUT YOUR HAND AND CO WADE R NOT THAT YOUARE GOING TO GOING TO DO THAT ALL DAY OR OR EVERY DAY OR ANYTHING IT'S NOT IT'S IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO DO BUT IT JUST SHOWS THAT YOU CAN ACTIVATE YOUR BROWN FIT JUST BY GETTING A TEMPERATURE CHANGE ON YOUR SKIN SO YOU CAN GO OUTSIDE AND TEASH U THAT'S WHY ALSO WE WERE JUST TURGING ABOUT WHILE PEOPLE WHO WORKS OUTSIDE OR MOVE A LOT OR GET OUT IN AND OUT OF IT LIKE CHANGING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE BODY ALL THE TIME THEY WILL HAVE MORE BROWN FAT AND E ACTIVATING THAT IS GOING TO KEEP YOUR METAPOLISM HIGHER AND YOUR INSOLEN SENSITIVITY IS STUDY HAVE ALSO JOWN THES SO THE BROWN FAT CAN BE ACTIVATED AS SOON AS YOU JUST CHANGE YOUR TIMBERTURE IN THE SKINS O GOING OUTSIDE IN AT TEA SHIRT WEARING COOLING BEST ALSO STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THIS FOR TEN DAYS IT'S GONEE SO A GROW YOUR E YOU BROWN FAT SO YOU CAN GET MORE BROWN FET IF YOU EXPOSE YOURSELF TO THE COLD YOU DON'T HAVE TO START IN A COAT A SHOWER YOU DON'T HAVE TO START IN A COLD A CLUNCH IF YOU ARE NOT REALLY READY FOR THAT YET BUT JUST EXPOSING YOURSELF TO THE CO WIND HAS ALSO SHOWN TO ACTIVATE YOUR BROWN FAT OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE A IN THIS AWAKE STATE IN THEN YOU CAN ALSO JO SLEEP IN THE COT AND YOU WON'T NOTICE THAT THAT MUCH MAY BE BUT STUDIES AT SHOWN THAT IF YOU SLEEP IN NINETEEN DEGREES SULSUOUS AND THEN YOU WILL ACTIVATE YOURE A BROWN FAT AND YOU WILL GROW YOUR BROWN FAT SO YOU HAVE MORE OF IT SO THIS IN VERY NICE STUDIES AND FROM HANSON IT OUT FROM TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEENS SHOWD THAT A A GROUP OF SUBJECTS WHO SLEPT IN A ROOM AT TWENTY FOUR DEGREES AND THEN THEY MADE THIS PETCITE SCANNINGS TO SEE HOW MUCH BROWN FET DO THEY HAVE FROM THE BEGINNING O WHAT WE CALL BASELINE THEN THEY MEASURED AGAIN AFTER AN A MONTH OF SLEEPING IN NINETEEN DEGREES AND THEY SAW I THINK ITS REMARKABLE JUST ONE MONTH AT NINETEEN DEGREES SLEEPING THERE THEY HAD A DO BET ON AND THEY WERE STILL HAD CLOSE ON WEN TO E SLEEPING TO THEY'RE UNDER A COVER UNDER YAV RUNDER UNDER  TAT YA YANGER THE SUBJECTS O SLEEPING AT NINETEN DEGREE FOR ONE MONTH HAD INCREASED IS INSOLENT SENSITIVITY THEN NEXT MONTH THEY STEPPED AT TWENTY FOUR DEGREES THE MEASURED THIS AGAIN AND AND THER HAD DECREASED ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT AND THEN THEY SLEPT AT IT TWENTY SEVEN DEGREES SO QUITE WARM ROOM ACTUALLY FOR FOR THE A FOURTH MONTH AM AND THEY SAW A EVEN LESS A ACTIVATION OF THE BROWN FAT AND ALSO INSOLENSENSITIVELY SO IT SEEMS THAT YOU CAN EXPOSE YOURSELF AND PRET RAPIDLY THE BROWN FAT WILL RESPOND TO THIS BECAUSE IT'S SO SENSITIVE TO NOI DRENALIN RIOT SO IF YOU KEEP EXPOSING YOURSELF TO LITTLE BIT OF COLD YOUWILL ALSO GET A LIBIT A DAPTET TO IT BUT THAT'S BECAUSE THE BROWN FAT AND HAS GROWN THESE MORE MATO CONTRIE IN THE CELLS SO THESE SMALL ENERGY FATBREAKS THAT'S GOING T ACTIVATE THE CELLS AND THAT'S GOING TO TAKE UP GLUE COSS AND FAT FROM THE FATTY ASSIT'S FROM THE BLOT STREAM TO KEEP  THE THEMIGENESIS OCK AND THAT'S GOING TO CLEAR UP SOME SUGAR AND IS GOING TO CLEAGA ISO INTE IN THE BLOD STREAM AND SOME SOME FAT AS WELL SO THE BROWN FAT CAN IN THAT WAY DECREASE A OUR UNHEALTHY FAT WHICH IS THE WHITE FAT AND AND THE WHITE FAT IS WHAT WE DON'T ONE TOO MUCH OFF BUT WE STON NEED SOME OF COURSE IN AND IT'S OUR ENERGY STORAGE SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT IT'S THERE WE JUST DON'T NEED A LOT OF IT SO ON OUR THIGHS AND ALSO AROUND OUR INNER ORGANS THAT'S WHERE IT'S IT'S LOCATE IS SO IF WE CAN HAVE ECCIVATION OF THE BROWN FAT JUST BY GOING OUT IN THE COLD AND JUST BY SLEEPING IN A COLD ROOM OR IF YOU ARE HAVE COURAGE FOR IT YOU CAN GO OUT AND EXPOSE YOURSELF IN A COAT PLUNCH AND COAT SHOWERS IS ALSO GOING TO DO THE TRICK SO YOU CAN DO DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF THIS JUST EXPOSING YOURSELF TO VARIOUS TEMPERATURES IS GOING TO EXCIVATE THE BROWN FAT BECAUSE IT WAS INVOVED TO KEEP US IN A PERFECT WHOM YOR STATIC BALANCE REGARDING TEMPERATURE SO TO KEEP US ALIVE INCREDIBLE I WOULDN'T JUST GET A CLARIFICATION ROUND THIS NINETEEN DEGREES SELSIES I'M ROOM THAT THEIR SLEEPING IN SO THEIR UNDER A COMFORTER DUVAY AND 'M ANY MENTION THER CLOTHES ON A THE ROOM IS NINETEEN DEGREES SELSIES BUT THE TEMPERATURE UNDERNEATH THEIR BLANKET MIGHT NOT BE NINETEEN DEGREE SELSYS SO PRESUME LY IT'S THE COLD ON THEIR FACE THAT'S ACTIVATING AR THE THE INCREASE IN AR BROWN FAT THAT WAS OBSERVED IS THAT IS THAT A REASONABLE AN EXPECTATION I I THINK SO YEARE BECAUSE IT'S YOU HAVE SO MANY A COVERCEPTRES IN YOUR FACE AS IS SO IS ACTUALLY IT'S ENOUGH AND I THINK CORRESPONDS VERY WELL WITH THE STUDIES SHOWING THAT YOU CAN EXIVATE THE BROWN FAT JUST BY PUTTING A HAND INTO A A BOCKET OF COT WATER AND I DID THIS EXPERIMENT MYSELF IN IN MY STUDIES JUST TO SEE HOW WELL DID THEY A RESPOND TO COL WATER SO IT WAS SA FOUR DEGREES CELTUS A COL WATER FOR FOUR MINUTES AND THEN I JUST MESSURED BLOT PRESSURE AND HEART WRIGHT TO SEE TO THEY HAVE LIKE AN ACCAVATION OF THITES I ACTUALLY ALSO MEASURED THE BROWN FAT DURING THIS ERA COT EXPOSURE FOR FOUR MINUTES WITH AN INFORET THERMOGRAPHY CAMERA TO SEE CAN I SEE THAT THE BROWN FATIS ACCAVATED AND JUST BJUST TO TELL I GO BACK TO THE LOCATION OF THE BROWN FET SO USUALLY YOU CANNOT REALLY SEE EXCIVATION OF YOUR BOUFA E CASITS LOCATED ES SENSUALLY IN YOUR OR AROUND YOUR SENSR NERVOUS SYSTEM AN AND AND THE BIGGEST DEPO AS YOU MENTION BEFORE IS UP HERE E UNDER THE THE CLEBICULAR BONES SO AN AND VERY CLOSE TO THE SKIN'S SURFACE AND BECAUSE IT SO CLOSE TO THE SKINS SURFACE I COULD MEASURE IT WITH THIS VERY EXPENSIVE CAMERA EAND IT'S NOT VERY FEASIBT FOR PEOPLE TO GO HOME INTO THIS DON'T BECAUSE IT TAKES A LOT OF PRACTISE I CAN TELL AND BUT WE MEASURED THE BROWN FAT WITH THIS AN AND AND I COULD SEE THAT AFTER A FEW MINUTES THAT THE EXCIBATION WAS THERE AND INCREASE IN TEMPERATURE I AROSE FROM THAT IN ACCAVATION JUST FOUR MINUTES SO IT'S VERY RAPID AND I'M ALSO MEASURED IN MY STUDY HOW DEEP WAS THE BROWN FAT UNDER YOUR SKIN SO IT'S VERY CLOSE TO THE SURFACE WHICH ALSO SHOWS THAT IT IT NEEDS TO BE THERE TO TO HEAT YOU OF AND HE E HED YOUR INNER ORGANS BUT I'M DELIGHTED TO HEAR ALL OF THIS NNOT T I'LL TELL YOU WHY AND ONE IS BY WAY OF ENECDOTE I MENTION A LOLE BIT EARLIER THAT AS ANONER GRATUE ID I WORK ON ALL HAV THE STUDYE FROM MA JANCIS AND WERE EAN THAT IN ANIMALS BUT WE HARE THIS ROOM THAT WAS VERY COLD THE WHOLE ROOM WAS CALLED I THE GI WHO IR WORKED FOR AT THE TIME AN AM VERY CARLYLEAS A VERY ACCOMPLISHED PHYSEOLOGIST HE CAME FROM THIS LINEAN I DON'T KNOW IF THIS LITERATURE STILL A DISCUSSED MUCH BY ITS A BEAUTIFUL LITERATURE AM FROM WROTHWELL AND STOCK THEY WERE THE ONES WHO DISCOVERED A NON EXERCISE IN DUCE THERMA GENISIS THE FACT TOF PEOPLE BOUNCE WHO BOUNCED THEIR LEGS A LOT AND MOVE AROUND A LOT AND HAVE A LOT OF KIND OF A STARCASTIC MOVEMENT A BURN UP TO EIGHTEEN ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED CALLORIES MORE PER DAY THAN PEOPLE WHO SIT MORE STILL ASNT INCREDIBLE AND JUST INCREDIBLE A I DON'T THINK THAT WORK DESERT A GETS AS MUCH ATTENTIONA AS IT DESERVES PUBLISHIN JOURNALS LIKE NATURE SO VERY A FINE JOURNALS BUT IN ANY EVENT A ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I NOTICE WHEN I STARTED WORKING IN THAT LABORATORY WAS THAT I WAS COLD BECAUSE THE ROOM WAS COLD AND A DOCTOR CARLYLE HARRY A SAID WELL THE KEY IS TO WEAR A TEACHER IN HERE FOR ABOUT TWO THREE DAYS AND THEN YOU WILL COLD ADAPT I THOUGHT WELL WOULDN'T I WANT TO PUT ON A HOODIE AND GET WARM IN THERE SO I WAS COMFORTABLE N HE SAID NO ACTUALLY WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS GET YOURSELF UNCOMFORTABLY COLD ACTIVE AT YOUR BROWN FAT AND INDEED WHEN I DID THAT I THINK IWAS JUST TWO DAYS OF BEING IN THAT COLD ENVIRONMENT THEN I COULD COME BACK ON THE THIRD DAY AND BE PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE BECAUSE THE BROWN FAT HAD EXPANDED A WERE IT WERE ADDED MYDOCONDRIO OR BOTH AND I WAS PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE IN THAT ENVIRONMENT I ALSO GOT VERY VERY LEAN IN THOSE A IN THOSE DAYS ON WEEKS NOW I'VE NEVER BEEN SOMEBODY WHOSE VERY LEAN NORM Y SOMEBODY WHO CARRIES A LOT OF EXCESS AT OF POSTISSUUM T HAVE SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE I'M SURE I COULD ADJUST THAT WITH FEEDING IF I WON TO BUT IT WAS IT WAS STRIKING A WHAT A POWERFUL EFFACT IT HAD ON MY ENTIRE SYSTEM OF THERMAL REGULATION AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I A ALSO DELIGHTED IN WHEN SELL REPORTS A MEDICINE PUBLISHED YOUR STUDY AS THEY HAD IN AN ACCOMPANYING A PRESS RELEASE THAT WENT OUT TO TO THOSE OF US THAT REOVE PRESS RELEASEIS IN IT DESCRIBED A A A SAING AND SCANDINAVIA WHICH IS A ESSENTIALLY I'M NOT AN ATTEMPT TO I SPEAK A DANISH EVENTHOUGH I HAVE A MUCH OF MY FAMILY AS IN DENMARK A BELIVE NOT FROM DENMARK UM WE'VE LOT OF DANES IN MY FAMILY UM I WON'T EMBARRASS MYSELF MY TRYING TO SPEAK DANISH AS I DID BEFORE THE THE MICROPHONES WERE ROLLING BUT UM THAT THERE'S A SAYING THAT I THINK ESSENTIALLY A TRANSLATES TO IN THE FALL WHEN WHEN YOU'RE APPROACHING WINTER YOU WANT TO ACTUALLY WEAR FEWER LAYERS NOT BUNDLE UP WHEN YOU GO OUTSIDE SO THAT YOU CAN PREPARE YOURSELF FOR THE COLD OF WINTER AND BE ABLE TO HEAT YOURSELF UP USING YOUR BROWN FAT AND THAT IN THE SPRING AS THE TEMPERATURES ARE WARMING RATHER THAN REMOVING LAYERS YOU WANT TO WEAR MORE LAYERS IN ORDER TO BE A LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLY WARM SO THAT IN THE HEAT OF THE SUMMER YOU'RE BETTER AT COOLING YOUR BODY DO I HAVE THAT RIGHT ANABY DO YOU KNOW THE SAYING AND WULD YOU BE WILLING TO SHARE IT ONLY THE SWEDES AND UM A AND DANES WILL BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND UM MAYBE THE NORWEGIANS TO IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT THAT'S O KA YA SO I KNOW THAT I KNOW THAT THE CONCEPT OF IT BECAUSE WE SAY IT YE SHOULD YOU SHOULD WEAR A LESS BEFORE WINSER AND THEY AND MORE BEFORE SUMMER SO THERE IT IS IN THE HALLOR SO ITHEECAUSE IT ATO BE ECERTERI YE AND AND YOU'RE COMPLETELY RIOT AND I THINK THIS IS TA THIS IS JUST SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW IN THE SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRI ES I THINK THAT WE WE WE ININTOITIVELY KNOW THIS BUT IF WE JUST GO BACK I THE BIN I HISTORY I THINK THAT'S IM AROUND IN NINETEEN FIFTIES E THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT WENT OUT AND SAID WHILE WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE TO TOBACCOLOSISA IN PEN TE MAKE I OR EPI TA MAKE THE WORSE AT THAT THIS TIME SO THAT THEY WANTED TO HAVE TO THE PEOPLE AM BE MORE BRASCILIAN TO THE COLD AND ALSO INCREASE OUR EUMUNS E SYSTEM SO IN SCANDINAVIA AN EXTIOSINTRUSSIA WE HAVE PUT OUR BABIES OUTSIDE TO SLEEP A IN THE PROM AND THAT IS LIKE TO IA SO TO TO  GET MORE RESISTANCE TO THE COLD BUT ALSO TO INCREASE OUR UMAN SYSTEM AD WE STILL DO THAT AND THEN MIKE THA WE YOU REALLY YET WE DO ABIES ARE TAKEN OUT IN THE COLD AN THE SNOW AND FROSTY RAIN EVERYTHING MY TO BOYS HAVE BEEN SLEEPING OUT IN WINTER OR AT LEAST THE FIR THEIR FIRST MANY FREE FOR FIVE YEARS BECAUSE IT'S LIKE VERY GOOD FOR THEM AN THEY GET A THE A BETTER A UMION SYSTEM AND GET VRASILIAN TO THE CODS THAT IT WILL HAVE LESS CODS AND ALSO THEY RUN AROUND IN A TEA SHED WHEN IT SUPER CO BECAUSE THEY HAVE ACTIBATED ALL THEIR BROWN FET I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND AT THAT TIME I MUS S I MUST SAY BUT I CANNO LIKE INTO IT TO BE ALSO NEW BECAUSE WE HAVE INHERITED THIS A WAY OF DOING THINGS WITH OUR CULTURE SO AND HAVE HEARD PEOPLE COMING FROM THE YEW AS SAYING A DANS A CRAZY THEY PUT THEIR BABIES OUTSIDE AND PROMPS AND LEAVE THEM THERE THE NICKLE INSIDE AND DRINK COFFEY AND THE   ID OLL THE DAINS ARE CRAZY I I I I ADORE THE DA A THE OTHER AMAZING A CULTURE AND PEOPLE I'M SO FORTUNATE HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS A FROM DENWARK BUT I DID NOTICE SO WHEN WHEN WE WERE IN COPENHAGENAN AND I KNOW AM WE WE SAW YOU THERE NOT LONG AGO IT WAS JUNE AM THE WATER IN THE HARBOUR WAS CWAS COLD YER FOR EVEN THOUGH THE PACIFIC IS CLOSE TO HEAR ON WHICH IS VERY COLD I FELT PRETTY COLD BUT I IT WAS SUMMER TIME  ISH A SO PEOPLE WERE IN SUMMER TIME MOWED NIGHT TY SHIRTS IN SHORT SOMETHINGS THAT THAT SORT BUT IT DID STRIKE ME THAT PEOPLE IN COPENHAGEN ARE DRAMATICALLY FITTER THEN THEY ARE IN THE UNITED STATES  ME FOR SAW EVERYONE'S BICYCLING EVERYWHERE A NOT MANY PEOPLE WEARING SUN GLASSES SO TRYING TO EXTRACT AS MUCH FOTON ENERGY FROM THE SUN AS POSSIBLE WHICH I SUPPORT AH AS EVERYONE KNOWS AT A BICFAN OF GETTING SUN BUT ALSO AM WHEN WE DID SEE SWIMMERS AM THEY WERE SWIMMING IN THIS COLD WATER AND LIKE IT WAS NOTHING AND THERE THE RANGIN AGE OF THE SWIMMERS WAS WHAT WAS MARKABLE YOU SAW THE KIND OF FIT TRYATHLETE LOOKING TYPES BUT ALSO YOUNG KIDS I REALLY YOUNG KIDS AND THE PEOPLE PROBABLY IN THERE AGAIN THERE THE SEVENTIES EIGHTIES MADE EVEN NINETIES REALLY A REMARKABLE A VASTLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU SEE IF YOU GO TO THE OCEAN HERE IN A LOSS ANGELISERN OR ELSEWHERE SO IM A YOU SKANANAVIANS ARE ON TO SOMETHING WITH THIS I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT YOUR STUDY I'M IF YOU COULD GIVE A SOLOBIT OF THE BACKDROP ABOUT WHAT MOTIVATED THAT STUDY AND THEN IUM AND THEN WALK US THROUGH WHAT YOU DID YOU KNOW WHO THE SUBJECTS WERE IUM WHAT YOU HAD THEM DO WHAT YOU MEASURED I'M INAS MUCH DETAIL AS YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT YOU KNOW EVEN  FAIR TO SAY LANDMARK STUDY BECAUSE IT ALSO EXPLORED NOT JUST COLD BUT SONA AND THE THE CO USE OF COLD AND SANA AS A WAY TO PROBE METABOLISM AND BROWN FAT AND OTHER MARKERS AS WELL AND AS YOU DO THIS II'M HOPING AT SOME POINT THAT YOU MIGHT AN TELL US SOME OF THE OBSERVATIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE MADE THAT INTERESTED YOU THAT PERHAPS WERE NOT IN THE PAPER ASE THAT'S ONE OF THE GREAT BENEFITS OF SITTING ACROSS FROM SOMEBODY WHO WHO DID THE WORK IN DETAILS SO I'M EF OU COULD TELL US ABOUT YOUR STUDY UM AND O WHAT YOU DID IN WHAT YOU DISCOVERED THINK YOU FOR THA QUESTIONA ANDREW I I LOVE TO LIKE AL SO EXPLAIN A LIET WHAT DID WE DO BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE READ THIS KIND OF PAPER THEY JUST SEE THE NUMBERS THEY DON'T SEE WHAT WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THAT AN HUMAN STUDIES ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM FROM MY STUDY MY STUDY YOU CAN DO A KNOCK OUT OF SOMETHING AND THEN EVERYTHING IS LIKE PERFECTLY MATCHED AND CONTROL YOU IN HUMAN STUDIES IS VERY FAR DIFFERENT FROM THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT EVEN IN THE GROUPS SO YA BUT WHAT WE IN WHEN ESTOTED THIS RECEART IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN I DID NOT REALLY KNOW WHAT THE BROWN FAT WAS TU S TOT READING OP ON ALL THIS AND I WAS VERY INTERESTED IN PREVENTIV  MEDICINE AM ALSO TO STUDIES THAT I DID BE ORBRI BROWN FAT WAS AL SO LIKE VERY MUCH NIN THE PREVENTIVE SIDE LIKE HOW CAN WE THAT WAS ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE BUT IT THE SWEET TOOTH AND HOW CAN WE LOWER OUR SWEET TOTH AND STUFF LIKE TAT SO BUT AFTER THAT I WANTED TO TO DO SOMETHING NEW SO I LOOK INTO THE BROWN FAT GOT HIGHE IN THIS A FANTASTIC RESEARCH GROUP WERE THEY IT'S THE SELL GROUPS A DAY MOSTLY DID SELL STUDIES AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY ONE TO DO A HUMAN STUDY YET AM AN THEM BUT THEY REALLY WANTED ME TO TO DO THAT SO I RET UPON A LOT OF RESEARCH ABOUT HOW DOES THE BROWN FET GAT ACTIVATED WHAT HAVE BEEN DONE ALREADY AND I MENTIONED THE PAPER BEFORE WITH SLEEPING IN THE COLD I FOUN THAT PARTICULAR PAPER VERY FASCINATING AND THAT WAS SO SO WHERE AM AT THAT TIME AS LIKE OCASE SO COLD EXPOSURE AS AN INTERVENTION OF SLEEPING IN THE COLD COULD BE A GOOD THING TO GO OUT AND SAY WHALL PEOPLE DO THIS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IS FIRST OF ALL IT WAS ALREADY DONE THERE WAS ONE THING BUT THE OTHER THING WAS LIKE WELL I WANTED TO TO SEE IF WE CAN DO AND LIKE SOME KIND OF ACTIVITY SO WE CAN HAVE PEOPLE MOVE AL SO GOOR DO SOMETHING DO SOMETHING TOGETHER OR WHATEVER AN AND AN THE COLD IMADE US THINK ABOUT WELL WAT ABOUT SWINTER SWIMMING AND IT WAS CANNOL LIKE A BIT OF A JOKE IN THE BEGINNING AS I WINTE SWIMMING YES CAN I EXTIVATE THE BROWN FET RIOT BUT BUT WHEN WE READ THE LITERATURE WE COULDN'T REALLY FIND ANYTHING ABOUT EXHIBATION OF THE BROWN FAT WITH COLD WATER BESIDES HAND IN A BUGGET OF COLD WATER THAT REAL THERE WAS ALREADY THERE SO WE WERE JUST THINK IT OQ SO IT SHOULD BE VERY PODENT EM EXHIBATION OF THE BROWN FET IF IT'S COLD WATER BUT VERY DIFFERENT FROM COLD AIRE SO IT WAS CANNOL ALSO A NEW THING WE WERE GOING IN TO AND IF WE KNEW THAT WE WERE GOING TO DO LIKE A MORE OF A M A A PROOF OF CONCEPT STUDY A AT THE BEGINNING OF AT BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE WINTER SWIMMERS AM MUST IN THEORY EXIBATE THE BROWND FAT RIGHT BUT WE CANNO DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WITH WAS THIS KIND OF STRESSER TOO MUCH TOO LITTLE OR WHAT WILL HAPPEN ACTUALLY BUT WE HAD THIS IDEA ABOUT WILE WE ALWAYS SAY THAT COLD WATER WINTER SWIMMING WILL ECIBATE YOUR MATABOLISM BUT DO BUT DO WE KNOW IF IT DID DOES THAT KNOW WE DON'T SO AND AND WHILE THIS IDEA WAS A LITTLE BIT A FUN FUN AT THE BEGINNING AND WE CANNEVER ACCEPTED IT WAUS LIE O CARELESS JUST TRY THIS OUT BUT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE FUNDING FOR IT WE WAS LIKE OCCA LET'S DO A PROVE A CONS UP STUDY AND LET'S GO WITH A SMALL NUMBER BUT ENOUGH TO SEE AND AT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROUPS SO THE POWER CALCULATION OF THAT STUDY IS DONE ON EH WHAT WE KNOW I FROM PETSITY SCANNINGS OF THE BROWN FAT SO THAT'S THE MAIN OUTCOME OF THAT OF COURSE SO AND AND WE WANTED TO GO LITTLE BIT SMALLEN E NUMBERS OF PARTICIPANCE BECAUSE WE WANTED TO PARTICULATLE BI DEEPER INTO THE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS AND ALSO WE DO SOME OF THE E THE DAYS SO I REALLY WANTED TO DO THAT TO SEE IF I CAN REPLICATE ALSO THE FINE THINGS AND THAT'S GON TO TAKE A LOT OF A LOT OF A FUNDING BUT ITS ALSO GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF TIME TO DO IT AND SO THE PROVE A CONSTET WAS JUST GOING SMALL BUT LOOKING AT DIFFERENT MECHANISMS WE ALSO TOOK AND  FAT BI AP SEASE FOR EXAMPLE AND LOOKED AT THE WHITE FAT TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GROUPS BEFORE AND AFTER AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO THAT'S CANNA LIKE HOW IT STARTED AND THEN THE FIRST YEAR WAS LIKE I FEEL STUDY FOR ME SO I WAS NOT A WINTER SWIMMER WHEN I STARTED THIS IT WAS JUST OR REALLY NO I WASN'T AN AT ALL I NON EVER SAY OURS A BIT O HIT OF THE COLD MYSELF AND BIT OF A COLD SISSY AN ALWAYS COLD HAVING BIG SOCKS ON AND SWEATERS AND STELT LIKE THAT' THOUG US LIKE I AM SO COMFORTABLE I'M JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE VERY COMFORTABLE I LIKE BEING COMCOMPLETEY TEMPERTURE NEUTRAL AND BUT I STARTNA LIKE LAING WITH THI THOUGHT LIKE WELE IF THIS IS SO HEALTHY IN THEORY I SHOULD NOT PACK MYSELF UP I SHOULD START NOT DOING THAT BUT THE FIRST YEAR OBSERVATION I WHEN TO SWIM US UNDERTETTY THEY CAND OFE JOKED ABOUT AS THEY COME ON AS UNDER OU NEET TO TRY THIS YOU CANNOT STUDY THIS AN UNLESS YOU HAVE TRIED IT I NOWS LIKE HOW VERY FUNNY OF COURSE I CAN DO THAT BUT I COULDN'T I I READ THE LATY TO I UNDERSTOOD AN THEORY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO INTO CO WATER BUT I COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD IT WHEN I FIRST TRIED IT THE FIRST FEW TIMES NOT SO FUNNY IT FELT PAINFUL IT WAS JUST LIKE RUNNING TOO LONG I AFTER A LONG BREAK AND YOU AND YOUR MUSCLES HAV THE DAY AFTER RIDT YOU YOU COMPLETELY REGRET THAT YOU TOOK THAT EXTRAMI WOUTD AOUT WHEN YOU SAY UNCOMFORTABLE YOU MEAN UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN YOU GOT IN AND WHEN YOU WERE IN OR UNCOMFORTABLE AFTERWARDS BECAUSE I FIND THAT IM ON RARE OCCASIONS I SHOULD JUST AT FULL DISCLOSURE I I DO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE EVERY MORNING FOR ABOUT A MINUTE TO TWO MINUTES IN A COLD PLUNGE THERE ARE DAYS THAT I MISS BUT WHEN I'M AT HOME I DO THAT AND WHEN I TRAVEL I DO A COLD SHOWER I DO FINISH WITH A WORM SHOWER SO IM AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHY THAT'S PROBELLY NOT THE BEST IDEA BUT IM AND I'VE BEN DOING IT FOR SOME YEARS NOW IM ON AND OFF A BUT I' SO JUST FULL DISCLOSURE ON A DEVOT TEE IM AND I HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT I HATE THE THE COLD BUT HAVE GOTT INTO IT AND AND ARE STARTING TO LIKE IT BUT THEY DON'T AND I DON'T NECESSARILY LIKE THE EXPERIENCE IN THE COLD WATER BUT I LOVE THE WAY I FEEL WHEN I GET OUT AND I E I'M A HUNDRED PER CENT ON THAT STATEMENT ABOUT LOVING IT WHEN I GET OUT OCCASIONALLY IT FEELS GOOD TO BE IN THERE IT FEELS INVIGORATING I THINK I'VE LEARNED TO CONTROL THE GAS REFLECTS AND THE HYPER VENTILATION AND I JUST HAVE TOLD MYSELF WHAT WE KNOW WHICH IS AT THE FOREBRAIN STRUGGLES TO ENGAGE FOR THE FIRST TWENTY OR THIRTY SECONDS BUT IF YOU CANGET PASS THAT WALL IT'S IT'S FAR EASIER TO TO PUSH THROUGH IM BUT WHEN YOU SAY THAT IT WAS REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE YOU MEAN THE EXPERIENCE OF GETTING IN OR YOU ALSO TELT LOUSY AFTERWARD NOW IAND VERY IMPORTANTE TO CLEAR THAT OUT I ONLY FELT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE DOING IT AT THE MOMENT BUT AFTERWARDS THE FIRST TIME I WENT IR WITH WITH A GROUP AND ACTUALLY MY HUSBAND WAS THUS AS WELL BECAUSE I I REALLY WONE IS SOME ONE I KNEW AM COMING ALONG BECAUSE HI'S VERY NORMAL IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE THIS BEFORE YOU FEEL A LIBET ANXIOUS ABOUT IT DIDN'T THIS IS JONIN STUDIES AS WELL BECAUSE BLO PRESSURE AND HARBREG GOES UP IN IN THOSE WHO ARE NEW TO THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY SO AM I WAS LIBERED ANXIOUS ABOUT IT SO IT WAS REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE JUST DOING AND PUT AFTERWARDS AS SOON AS I GOT UP I FEL FANTASTIC AND WE WENT IN TO THE SONA AND I DID THREE ROUNDS BECAUSE I JUST LOVED IT I LOVE THE FEELING AFTERWARDS BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALL THIS NEWTON'S MIDERS GOING IN YOUR BRAIN AND YOU FEEL MORE POSITIVE YOU FEEL I FEEL INVIGORATED HAD SO MUCH ENERGY AND THAT LIKE I I COULD TOTALLY SEE WHY PEOPLE WOULD DO THIS TO GET ENERGY THROUGHOUT THE DAY BECAUSE I DEFINITELY HAD THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THREE DIPS TO TO GET THAT I THINK ONE WOULD BE ENOUGH AND I OFTEN DO THAT ALSO NOW TO DAY I TO ONE DIP SOMETIMES I DO TWO O THREE IT DIPS IM IN IN ONE ROUND YOU CUTIN ONE DAY BUT I OFTEN IS LIKE JUST ONE OR TWO TIMES TO WEEK FOR ME THAT IS ENOUG TO TO GET THAT ENERGY AND TO GET THAT COSITIVE FEELING AND AND I THINK THAT THAT IS ALSO WHY I  I PUT UP MY STUDY IN THAT WAY I WANTED TO STUDY THE LOWEST DOSE YOU CAN SAY THE LOWEST AMOUNT AT WE CAN GET AWAY WITH BUT STILL SEE AM HELVE BENEFITS SO WHAT I OBSERVED THERE ON THE JEDDY WAS THAT SOME DIDIT A LONG TIME THERE WERE IN THE WATER FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND SO ME IT SEEMED MAYBE A LI EXTREME TO  GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE A LONG TER WELL SO MAYBE THERE WERE LIKE REALLY SWIMMING AND THEY CU BIT TWENTY MINUTES OF HALF AN HOURS A LONG TER THIT'S A LONG TIME AND THERE WAS LIKE ICE AND PEOPLE WHO CAME UP I MEAN I JUST DIDN'T REALLY FEEL THAT THIS IS A SOMETHING THAT I WANTED TO GO OUT AND RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE AFTER IM MI WANTINYYYSER SUBJECT DYING YTER EGAS I YOU'RE NOT ADAPTED AN Y PEOPLE OF  YOU KNOW PEOPLE CAN'T DO THET ALSO AT TWENTY MINUTE COL SHOWER OR TWENTY MINUTE COL PLUNGE I KNOW PEOPLE DO IT BUT IS PROBABLY NOT A GOOD IDEA NOT PROBABLY NOT ITSCONEXHAUST YOURSELVES AND A THEN MAKE THEM AGE TOO FAST SO EXECTLLY THAT'S E WHEN YOU PASS THAT HOMETIC STRESS AS THE HEALTHY STRESS LEVEL THAT'S WHAT IS HAPPENING BE QUITE OPPOSITE S IS A ALMOST CHRONIC STRESS EXUALLY IN THEMSELVES WELL WHAT HAPPENED THEN WAS THAT AM I FOUND OUT THAT IF I WANT TO HAVE THIS PROTOCO GET THROUGH ETHICOL COMETCY I I REALLY NEEDED TO GO LIKE VERY LIKE SLEEP WITH THEY NOT TOO LONG AND AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE ALSO VERY HEALTHY AND AND TO GET APPROVAL OF COURSE OF THI STUDY AN BUT WHAT I DID WAS TO TO RECRUIT WIN TO SWIMMERS WHO ALREADY HAVE BEEN SWIMMING FOR TWO OR THREE SEASONS AND I JUST OBSERVED THEM I SAID I'M NOT GONE IT DO AND INTERVENTION STUDY YET I DID THAT AFTER BUT I I WANTED TO DO LIKE A PROOF OF CONCEPT WHERE THEY WERE ALREADY ADAPTED TO THE COLD AND THEN COMPARE THEM TO A MATCH CONTROL GROUP WHO WERE MATCHED ON AM ON YOU IS A DIET SO WERTHEY VIGETARIAN OR NOT AM AND ONE OF THEM WORSE IN EACH GROUP E ALSO THEY WEREN'T ALL VEGETARIAN NO NO NO IST ONE IN EACH GROUP I CAN SAY WITH ALL THE AMAZING FISH IN MEAT IN IA THEN MAROU TO HAVE A HARD TIME MA YETTERI NO RADS OR AMAZING THE FRUITS ON VEGUALES TO BUT ICE TO THER WERE COUPLE F VEGETARIANS IN EACH GROUP YETONE ONE IN EACH YOUNGER AND THEY WERE MATTLED ONVEGETARIAN I HAVE TEEN REMEMBERS YO REGETARIAN I'M JUST COKEN E YE BUT THER WERE THEY WERE MATCHD ON DIFFERENT THINGS SO WHAT WE USUALLY MATCHD THEM ON IS ALSO BE AM I AM WE CHOSE ONE GENDRE IN THIS STUDY AND WE WOULD ALWAYS CHOOSE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN O MILY BUT WE DO SEE THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT A BROWN FET LEVELS A DEPENDING ON GENDERA SO WOMEN HAVE MORE BROWN FAT THAN MEN REALLY  INTERESTING YE A THNG IS INTERESTING E A DESERVE STUDY YE YE WHY ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WOMEN ARE ALSO SMALLER SO IN SIZE AND MASS RIGHT BUT THEY ALSO HAVE AND AN LOWER PERIPHO TEMPERATURE ESPECIALLY ON HANDS AND EARS AND IS A RIGHT THAT'S THAT'S DOCUMENT ED THE WOMEN DO RUN COLDER THAN MEN YE AND THERE'S TOLOGICALLY I DIDN'T SY PSYCHOLOGIC NO NO NO WE WON'T WE WON'T GO TO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL YTHAT'S DIFFERENT YER NOMETHING ELSE THT'S A DIFFERENT PART CAST YANOTHER TIME SO WOMEN ARE JUST COLDER PHYSICALLY IS SO ON HANDS AND EAR SITS MESHED ON THAT AN AND AND AN FEET AS WELL SO COMPATE TO MEN AND MEN HAVE BIGGER HEARTS THAND WOMEN AND THEY CAN PUMP OUT MORE PLOT A PERIPO  THAN IN A WOMEN'S BODY SO THEY BHE COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE COLDER HANDSFICK SEMBLE SO COMFORTABLE STATE IS ALSO DIFFERENT BETWEEN GEN GENDERAS SO MEN ARE MORE COMFORTABLE AT TWENTY TWO DEGREES SELSIUS AND WOMEN ARE THE MRE COMFORTABLE AT TWENTY FOUR DEGREES SELSIUS AND THESE ARE THE THERMOSTAT WORS OF HOME HAVE BEEN NOW VALID THARES THE STUDY DEGREES ELSIES BY THE WAY PRIOR TO A STARTING RECORDING A I MADE THE EXECUTIVE DECISION THAT WE WERE GOING TO GO WITH SELSIEST THROUGHOUT THE PODCAST AN BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE WORLD USES SELSIE SO FOR THOSE YE THAT THINK IN FAREN HEITE AM THE INTERNET IS YOUR FRIEND IN MAKING THOSE CONVERSIONS WES WERE STICKING WI SELSIES SO MEN TEND TO BE THERO COMFORTABLE AT TWENTY TWO DEGREES SELSIES WOMEN AT TWENTY FOUR I INTERESTING EXPLAIN A LOT ABOUT LIKE ASO SOME ARGUMENTS IN THE HOMES WHERE MEN ARE TURNING DOWN THE EATER AND WOMEN IOF THEEADER AND THEY CANNOT REALLY SO IT'S IT'S REALLY IS I'M ON BOTH SIDES HERE I UNDERSTAND THE MEN WE UNDERSTAND THE WOMEN BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE THERE WHICH WAS ALSO ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE  HAD WE IN THIS PROPOCONS HAVE STUDIE YOS ONE GENDR SO IT IS NOT LIKE ONLY BECAUSE WE WANTED TO STUDY MEN IT WAS JUST TO SEE TO LIMINATE E OLD THE CONFOUNDING FACTORS WHICH COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON ON OUR RESOURTS SO AM THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS AM BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE YES SO WOMEN HAVE HAVE MORE BROWN FAT THAN MEN NOTHERWISE WE WOULD HAVE TO LIKE DO FOUR GROUPS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND NOT HAVING FUNDING YET WE WERE LIKE OCHE WE NEED TO DO LIKE WHICH IS ONE A GROUP JUST CATRO GROUP AND THEN I AND A GROUP WHO  ALWAYS EWINTERS SWIMMERS SO I RECRUITED WHEN TO SWIMMERS WO HAVE BEEN SWIN FOR TWO TO THREE SEASONS M BECAUSE I WANTED THEM TO BE ALREADY ADAPTED BUT NOT GOING TOO LONG IN THE WATER SO THEY TOLD ME E I DID A LOT OF SCREENING HERE OF COURSE BEFOREHAND AND INTIVEWS TO SEE TOAS TOM HOW MUCH DO YOU DO AND AM HOW MUCH DO YOU HOW LONG O YOU STAY IN THE WATER AND I AM MONITORD HOW LONG DID DIDN'T STAY IN THE WATERD RECRUITED BASED ON AM THAT THEY ONLY DID LIKE TO TO THREE TIMES TO WEEK IT SEEMS REASONABLE E FOR FOR DENMARK AT LEAST TO DO THAT AND THEY STAYED ONLY IN THE WATER FOR ONE TO TWO MINUTES SO THE COSER SUBSIDES VERY QUICKLY AND YOU WOULD GET THIS EXHIBATION OF YOUR RESTAN TI JUST SYSTEM WHICH IS YOUR PARIS IMPATIC NERVOUS SYSTEMS OF THE THE OTHER BRANCH OF YOUR ORDER E NOMOUS NERVOUS SYSTEM AND YOU GET THAT EXHIBATION BECAUSE YOU SUBMERGE INTO COLD WATER AND WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU HAVE AN EXHIBATION OF YOUR DIVING RESPONSE AND THE THAT'S GONE A SLOW DOWN THE YOU CAN SAY THE THE CONSUMPTION OF OXYGEN ALSO IN YOUR BODY AND THAT'S GONSLOW DOWN YOUR HEART RADE AND I PAUSE YOU ON THE SCAN I HEAR THIS BEFORE THAT WHEN WE GET INTO COLD WATER SHOWE OR OR IMMERSION WE GET THIS SYMPATHETIC AUTONOMIC RESPONSE O INCREASE BLOOD PRESSUR INCREASE HEART RATE RELEASE OF NORUPE AN EFFRAN FROM THE LOCUS RULIOUS IN THE BRAIN RELEASE OF I'M A GENTLEMAN DOPEMEAN A GENTLEMAN FROM THE FROM THE JRENALS DON'T B MEAN PRESUMBLY WITHIN THE BRAIN BUT THAT THE PARI SYMPATHETIC RESPONSE IS ACTVATED WHEN WE PUT OUR FACE INTO COLD WATER OR GO UNDER WATER AND THAT'S A CALMING RELAXATION RESPONSE SO THIS BRINGS US BACK TO I DON'T ONT TAKE US OFF TRACK FROM YOU DESCRIBE IN THE STUDY BUT THIS BRINGS US BACK TO THE FIRST QUESTION WHICH IS IF I GO COMPLETELY UNDER WATER FOR A MOMENT WHEN I START MY COLD PLUNGE DOES THAT CHANGE THAT PHYSIOLOGICAL OUTCOME AS COMPARATIVE I JUST SUBMERGE MYSELF UP TO THE NECK IN THAT ENACTUALLY NOW DIS THERE'ISTHAT SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF A MOVEMENT ON LINE OF PEOPLE PUTTING A BOWL OF ICE WATER ON THEIR COUNTERTOP AND SUBMERGING AFFACE INTO IT YOU SEE THUS AS TA START IVE TANON ARPOSTS ABOUT YES SO M CON YOU JUST TOUCH ON WHAT THE DIVORY FLECTS IS AND WHY IT ACT PERHAPS ACTIVATES THE PER SYMPATHETIC RESPONSE O THIS CALMING RESPONSE LET US THA THE DIVING REFLECTS IS EXIBATED WHEN YOU SUBMERGE INTO COOL WATER AM EVEN JUST TO THE NECK YE OR I THOUGHTYOU HAD TO GET YOUR FACE UNDER IM NOT  NOT ARGUING DIFFERENT YOURLY ICPERT I JUST WANT OU NEL I HAVEN'T REALLY I HAVEN'T READ THAT IV JUST SEEN I THAT YOU CAN ECIVATE YOUR  THAT DIVING RESPONDSE AS SOON AS YOU GO UNDER WATER WITH YOUR BODY AND SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT WITH YOUR FACE AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND I COULD I COULD BE WRONG THOUGH IM YE SO WHEN WHEN YOU EXIVATE YOUR A DIVING RESPONSE YOU SLOW DOWN YOUR IM YOUR OXYGEN CONSUMPTION AND YOUR BUDAND DOES IS BECAUSE THE BODY TRIES TO RESPRESER AM OXYGEN SO YOU WILL NOT GET HYPOTHERME TOO FAST SO IS KIND OF LIKE A SURVIVAL SYSTEM IN YOUR BODY AND SO THIS SURVIVAL SYSTEM IS VERY IM IMPORTANT FOR USE OF COURSE SO THAT WILL BE EXCAVATED AND TEY BECAUSE OF THAT YOUIL AFTER MAYBE ONE MINUTE OR SO IM TA CAN'T BE PRECISE ON THAT BECAUSE I MAY BE ALSO VERY SABITTEN INHUMANS SO ONE TO TWO MINUTES YOU HAVE FULL EXIBATION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM BUT ALSO THE PARISON PADING OTHE SYSTEM EM AND THAT'S GOING TO EXABATE FOR EXAMPLES SOMETHING LIKES SO TONIN IN YOUR BRAIN WHICH IS LIKE ALSO GOT FOR MENCA BALANS AND PEOPLE FEELING IN MENTAL BELLANCS AFTERWARDS THEY AFTER THEY GO UP I SO THAT IS LIKE MESS YOUR DONA E QUESTION AIRS AND ALSO MESER LIGAN AN AND A DOTES OF COURSE PEOPLE TELL ALL THE TIME THAT THEY FEEL GOOD AFTER WHATH WE NEED STUDIES ON THIS SO IF ANY ONE SITTING OUT THERE THINKING THAT'S INTERESTING THEN PLEASE DO SOME SUDY SOM THAT I ARY TO GET MORE OUT OF THAT YE SO YOU HAD SO YOU OBSERVE THESE WINTER SWIMMERS WHO ARE DONE THIS FOR A FEW SEASONS YE THEY'RE COMING AROUND FOR A NEW SEASON OF WINTER SWIMMING AND YOU'VE DECIDETO RECREAT THEM HE SUBJECTS THEY ARE GETTING INTO COLD WATER U CLIMBING DOWN A LADDER OR JUMPING INTO THE WATER UP TO THEIR NACK YE CLIMB YA  GET CLIMBING DOWN A LADDER INTO THE CAUS IS DONE OUTDOORS WHAT A FUN STUDY TO DO MY MY ADUA THES IS WAS DONE UNDER FLORESCENT LIGHTS WITH NO WINDOWS IN I IN A BUILDING AT AM AD ATON O FON AS A PAC E SOON ASYEHAT LIVED IN THE LABORATORY AS APEA SHE SOON I LOVED IT SO MUCH BUT M NOT SOMETHING REQUIRE TO DO A PEA SHE BY THE WAY BUT UM THEY'RE CLIMBING DOWN THE LADDER YE GETTING IN UP TO THEIR NECK STAYING IN FOR ONE TO TWO MINUTES AND THEN GETTING OUT AND HOW MANY TIMES A WEEK ER THEY DOING THIS SA TIT DO THIS TWO TO THREE TIMES TO WEEK AND FOR EACH TIME THEY GO EACH DAY THEY GO IF THEY TAKE THREE ROUNDS O SO FEDIPS AND TWO SONACISSENS SO THEY STORT IN THE COLD AND THEY END IN THE COLD WATER O CASE SO IT'S GET IN FOR ONE TO TWO MINUTES THEN GET OUT AND GET INTO THE SANA YE UM WHAT IS THE TEMPERATURE THE SONA ABOUT EIGHTY DEGREES SELCIOUS O K TH EN HOW LONG ARE THEY IN THISONOR SO THEY STAYED THERE I FOR TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES SO DEPENDING ON IF THEY WENT TWO TIMES PE WEEK OR THREE TIMES TE WEEK OK AND THEN THEY GET BACK INTO THE COLD FOR A FEW MINUTES YA FO MINUTES UP TO TWO MINUTES YO THEN BACK INTO THE SONOUR FIFTEEN MINUTES OR SO YET THEN BACK INTO THE COLD FOR A THIRD ROUND YET BACK INTO THISONOUR THEN THEN THEN THE'RE ENDING ON TEM THEN BACK INTO THE COLD AGAIN AND THEN ENDING ON COLD GAIN I AND WE'LL TOLK ABOAT WISE IMPORTANT END ON COLD THE SO CALLED SOBERD PRINCIPALE AM HOW COLD WAS THE WATER IN THIS PARTICULAR GIVEN THE AVERAGE CAUSE I RASE ITS OUT DOOR WINTER SWIMMING SO ITS CAN A VERY DEPENDING ON WIN SHILL AND THINGS AS WEALTH OF COURSE SO IT'S THE VERY UNCONTROLD ENVIRONMENT TO DO THIS KIND OF STUDIED AND BUT I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING THAT WAS AL SO VERY CLOSE TO SOMETHING PEOPLE CAN DO FOR FREE GOING OUT IN NATURE AND U STAD AND ALSO HAVE THE NATURE LIKE IT'S VERY HEALTHY INPACK ON US IT LOWES OUR STRESS ASTRESS LEVEL AT ESWELL SO BY DOING SO I ALSO MESTURE THE TEMPERATURE EVERY TIME THEY WENT SO I HAVELESS GRAF AND IS SEXUALLY IN WINTER SWIMMING BOOK IT SHOWS THE TEMPERATURE AND THEN MY GOING LIKE FROM OCTOBER TO APRIL AND ITS SLIKE STUPS AT TWELVE DEGREES SIR THINK IT URROUND TREVEL TO TWELVE DEGREES I SELSIO SIM THE WATER AND THEN IT GOES DOWN TO TWO DEGREES IN ON AVERAGE AND JANUARY AND THEN OFF AGAIN AND SO IT'S WITHIN THE SPECTRM UP VERY COLD WATER I WAS SAVE FROM AROUND FIFTEEN FIFTEEN DEGREES SULTUOUS AND AND DOWN BUT IT WAS SECTION NOT COLDER THAN LIKE TWO TO FOUR DEGREES LIN IN ON AVERAGE WHEN IT WAS THE COLDEST SO DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT COLD TO BE GOOD ENOUGH AND AND ENOUGH TO EXTIVATE OUR METABOLISM AND AND WHAT TIME OF DAY OR OM THE PRERCECIPENCE DOING THIS COLDSONOR ALTERNATION SO I THINK THEY DID THIS A  THREW OUT THE DAY SO I DIDN'T CONTROL W HETHER THEY WANTED TO GO IN THE MORNING IN THE AFTERNOON OR OR IN THE EVENING AT THAT TIME WHERE I SET UP THI STUDY I WIL I WAS NOT CONTROLLING IT IN THAT WAY I WANTED THEM TO GO WHENEVER THEY HAD TIME AND I ALSO THINK THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO GIVE OUT TO GIVE TO PEOBO IS WHEN DO IT WHEN YOU HAVE TIME IT'S NOT IF IF IF DOING IT I WHEN YOU GET HOME FROM WORK AND IT'S SIX O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING AND THIS IS THE TIME WHERE YOU ARE WHER YOU CAN DO ITIN AN EN TRY OUT IF IT'S GON  IMPACK YOUR SLEEP OR NOT IF IT DOESN'T IMPACK YOUR SLEEP THAN FINE BUT YOU HAVE TO TRY FOR YOURSELF AND FIND OUT WHAT WORKS FOR YOU ITS THE SAME FOR COFFEE FI SAN MARID SOME PEOPLE CAN DRINK COFFEE IN THE EVENING AND GO TO BED AND THEY CAN SLEEP I CAN'T ER EXERCISE OR EXERCISE EXACTLY SO I CAN'T I CAN'T DO THAT AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE COFFEE EXERCISE COLD WATER AND IMMERCIAN S GONNO EXIBATE YOUR A SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM YOU HAVE AN INCREASE IN STREST RESPONSE IN YOUR BODY AND AN THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT REALLY HARD TO FALL ASLEEP FOR SOME PEOPLE AT LEAST AND MAYBE YOU ARE SOOP EXHAUSTED ANYWAS AND THEN YOUWILL JUST CRASH N ANYWAYS BUT YET BUT AND THATS THAT'S THE ONLY THING SO I'D JUST TOLD THEM TO DO THIS IF THEY CAN DURING THE DAYTIME AND AND THAT'S PRAMALLY WHAT THEY ALSO DID AND THEN ALL LONG YOUR MEASURING BROWN FAT BY WAY OF THIS INFORED  CAMERA RIGHT IM SO WHAT DID YOU OBSERVE IN TERMS OF CHANGES IN BROWN FAT HOW QUICKLY DID THAT OCCUR AND UM AND THEN I'D LIKE TO ASK ALSO ABOUT SONA A BIT MORE BECAUSE EARLIER YOU MENTION THAT YOU CAN ACTIVEAT BROWN FAT WITH SONA IS WELL WITH HEAT I WUD YOUR FOR GET THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN UM HOW LONG DID IT TAKE BEFORE YOU OBSERVE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN BROWN FAT AND WAS IT INCREASE DENSITY OF MY BROWN FAT OR DISTRIBUTION WAS IT YOU KNOW SHOWING EXPANSION TO DIFFERENT REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE BODY AND I MAYBE COULD ALSO TOUCH ON SOME OF THE CHANGES IN INSINSOLENT SENSITIVITY IN METAPOLISM YE A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND AND I DIDN'T MENTION THE SPIRIT BEFORE BUT BESIDES MEASURING IM A TEMPERATURE AS AN OUTCOME FOR BROWN FAT ACTIBITY WE ALSO I DID PI AM OR IYE SCANING AR OF THE BROWN FETS OF DISDISLIKE THE THE GOLDEN STANDARD A FOR MEASURING BROWN FAEN IN IS NOT VERY FEASIBLE FOR NOMAL PEOPLE TO GET AND AND A PIT ESEEDSE OR PIT AM OR I A SCANNING OF THE BRON FAT IS SUPEREXPENSIVE AND SO WE HAD BOTH A TO SEE IF WE KID HAVE LIKE A CONTINUOUS A MEASURE OF BROWN FAT INHUMANS BECAUSE THAT WAS ALREADY NOT NOT OUT THERE SO WANTED TO SEE DURING BOTH THE EXPERIMENTSAL DAYS BUT ALSO DURING DAY AND NIGHT WHAT KIND OF LIKE SUCCATION A RHYTHM DO WE HAVE IN OUR BROWN FAT ACTIBITY SO THAT'S WHY  WON ID HAVE THAT AS WELL SO THE PETSISY SCANNING A OR THER PIT AM OR I SCANNING WAS TO SEE UPON COLD EXHIBATION AND STIMULATION FOR SOME HOURS DO WE HAVE ACIBATION CAN WE SEE THE BROWN FET IN THIS SUBJECT AND ALSO DURING THEMINAUTRALITY OF THEM COMFORTABLE STATE A HOW IS THAT EXIBATED IN EACH OF THE GROUP OF COURSE AS DO YOU WANT TO SEE HOW COMFORTABLE PEOPLE WERE AWAY FROM THE COLD WATER AND SONOR TO AT DIFFERENT UM TEMPERATURE INMIREMENTS IS AT RIGHT YES I ALSO MEASURED THAT HOW COMFORTABLE ARE YOU I HAD I MADE THE SCALE LIKE BE SULE AN ALOGUE SCALE AND ASKED THEM HOW COMFORTABLE DO YOU FEEL WITH THIS TEMPERATURE AND AND THREW OUT THE STUDY DAYS DURING COLD EXPOSURE AND THE MOR COMFORTABLE DAY THET HAD A WHOLE DAY WHERE JUST KEPT THEM A THEMO COMFORTABLE TO SE DO THEY ACCIBATE THE BROWN FAT IF THEY ARE JUST COMPLETELY THE MOR COMFORTABLE AS GOOD AS WE COULD GET WITH THAM KUS YOU WERE ASKING PEOPLE AN ON A SCALE FOR RON ONE TO TAN AND FIVE BEING THE M COMFORTABLE WHERE ARE YOU ON THE SCALES OF ONE WOULD BE VERY COLD AND TEN WOULD BE SUPER BURNING HEAT AND YE AND SO THAT WAS THE WAY TO LIKE IT TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO THEY ACTUALLY FEEL EY ALSO DOING THE STUDIES ALSO MEASURED I IN ELECTUR A MIOGRAPHY A SO OF OF MUSCLES TO SEE TO THEY SHIVER DURING THE COOLING THEY A SOMETIMES PEOPLE SHIVER BEFORE THEY KNOW THAT REALLY SHIVERING SO I HAVE INTERESTIN YE SA IS OR A CONSCIOUS PERCEPTION OF SHIVERING MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST READ OUT OF SHIVER YELO YOU IF YOU ALSO GET ADAPTED TO THE COLD WATER YOU WULD HAVE IF LESS SHIVERING THER WOULD BE LESS VIGOROUS THERE WOULD BE VERY SMALL SO YOU WOULDN'T PROBABLY KNOW THAT YOUR SHIVERING BECAUSE THIS TE SHIVERING IS SO SMALL AND E MA TO CONDERA IN THE MMUSCLES SELLES WOULD BE SO THENCE THAT IT DOESN'T NEED TO SHIVER MAY BE THAT MUCH TO GET IT THAT A SOME WOR GENESIS COING AN COMPATE TO WHEN YOU'RE COMPLETELY NEW IT TO COL WER WATER EXPOSURE YOU'RE NOT ADAPTED THAN THE BODY NEEDS TO CREATE THESE MITO CONTRAD THESE ENERGY FABBRICS TO KEEP YOU WARM AND THAT'S ALSO WHAT'S THE EXERCISE IS IN THE BEGINNING BUT AM WHEN WE MEASURED THIS WE WE DID SEE THAT THE WINSER SWIMMERS WERE SHIVERING LESS E OR E HAVING LESS A VIGOROUS SHIVERING WHEN THEY SAID I'M COLD SO EVEN THOUGH THEY THEY PERCEPTION THAT PERCEPTION OF THE COP WAS PRETTY SIMILAR AND N IN THE IN TE GROUPS AND WE COULD SEE THAT THE THE EXIVATION OF THE THE MUSCLES THAT WE MEASURED ON AN WERE DIFFERENT AND MORE BICCUROUS IN THE CONTROL WER THE SUBJECTS IN SENT OF ISES TO BE IN THE STUDY WHEN THEY PAID OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORTER THEY JUST HAPPENED A LIKE DOING A COLDENS HONOR  AND SO THAT'S WHY THEY DID THE STUDY AN WHILE THEY GOT PAID A LITTLE BIT A FOR I BUT NOT MUCH AND AN IT THE THAT'S HOW WE DO THIS SOER I WAS JUS TACURA YE YO I JUST CURUS THERE MIGH BE SOME FOLKS OF WONDER SO  SO WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER IN TERMS OF CHANGES IN BROWN FAT INSLENT RESISTANCE OR INSOLENT SENSITIVITY RATHER AND AM MATAME MOISELLE SO WHAT WE WE SAW E WAS WE HAD THIS KIND OF DIFFERENT MEASURES AN TO SEE WHAT IS TO TRAN ON WROL WHAT WAS ACTUALLY GOING ON WHEN THEY ARE ALREADY ADAPTED TO THE COL WATER COMPARED TO A CONTROL GROUP WHO WAS I MATCHE  ON ON BARBARIOUS PARAMAD US WE WE DID SEE THAT THE WINTERS SWIMMERS HAD AND INCREASE INSOLEN SENSITIVITY THEY PRODUCED LESS INSOLEN  ON ALL THE EXPERIMENTAL DAYS SO BESIDES FROM JUST COOLING THEM AND MEASURING THE BROWN FAT ON EACH OF THESE COOLING DAYS OER TWO COOLING DAYS AND ONE FO MORE COMFORTABLE DEY RAN SO I WANTED TO MEASURE INSOLEN WINDER JUST THEY WERE FASTING MEANING THAT THEY HADN'T EATEN IN A EIGHT HOURS BEFORE THE STUDY DAY AND AND THEY WERECOMPLETELY LANG STILL NOT MOVING JUST IN A BET AND AND WE MEASURED INSOLEN A DURING THE EXPERIMENTAL DAY JUST TO SEE HOW WHAT LEVEL ARE THEY ON AND WE COULD SEE THAT THE THE DTHE WINTER SWIMMAT HAD LOWER PRODUCTION OF INSOLEN AND THEY AL SO WHEN THEY HAT AND BLUECOST TRANK SO WE GIVE THEM THAT TO SEE IF THEY TO TEST BEFORE WE ENROLL THEM IN STUDIES TO SEE IF THEY HAVE DIBEDIS FOR EXTAND AND NOT KNOWING FOR EXEM I THAT THAT WOULDN'T THAT WOULD LIKE RUIN MAY BE THE STUDIES SO WE TEST FOR THAT AND SEE IF THEY HAVE LIKE A NORMAL CURVE SO WHAT WAYS TID SEEIN THAT WAS AT THE WINTER SWIMMERS HAD A FAST A GLUECOST CLEARANCE IN THE BLOOD STREAM SO AFTER TWO HOURS  WE COULD SEE THAT THEY HAD A LOWER LEVEL AND WENT THE CURVE WENT DOWN FASTER THAN ANCANTRO GROOS SO DIS PAY HAVING LOWER INSOLEN RELEASE THEY HAVE BETTER BLOOD LU COST CLEARANCE WHICH IS REALLY WHAT YOU WANT WHAT WE ALL SEE CAREYOUL ECCESSIVE INSOLENT IS BAD INSOLEN BEING A UM MORE OR LESS A SHAPERON FOR A BLOOD GLUCOSE I A CAN DO ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS AS WELL OF COURSE BUT A AND HAVING HIG BLOGLE COS OBVIOUSLY TERRIBLE WE FOR SO LS ESPECIALLY BRAIN CELLS I DON'T THINK PEOPLE REALIZE HOW TALKSIC HIGH BLOOD AT GLUCOS IS HAVEN'T HIGECOTIS TURD B IF YOU YOU WANT TO KILL NARANS YOU MAKE YOU MAKE THER ACH PUT HIM IN IN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE'S TOO MUCH SUGAR A UM OH YE VERY A VERY NARROTALKSIC I MEAN THAT'S AND THER MECHANISMS LIKE INSOLENT THAT BUFF FOR THAT WE KEEP EN KEEPING BLOOD GLUCOS IN A REASONABLE RANGE SO THAT A THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN O MAN I THINK THAT'S WHY PEOPLE WILL GO INTO INSOLENEMIC SHOCK A HYPOGLISEMIC SHOCK IS ALSO POSSIBLE SO THAT RANGE IN WHICH NURONS ARE HAPPY IS NOT A BIT IS NOT A TREMENDOUSLY LARGE RANGE INCIDENTALLY THE RANGE IN WHICH NOURONS ARE ARE UM HAPPY IN SURVIVING A IS MUCH GREATER AS ONE GETS COLDER THAN WHEN YOU HEAT UP I MEAN THAT YOU N BASELY DESTROY BRAIN CELLS BY GETTING TOO HOT FOR TOO LONG Y A YOU CAN DOVILING DESTROY BRAIN CELLS PERMANENTLY BY GETTING TOO COLD FOR TOO LONG BUT YOU HAVE TO GET REALLY REALLY COLD FOR A REALLY LONG TIME YE A UM THE RAIMS FIFTY YE WEERE THINKING ABOUT DOING A AN EPISODE ON UM I HIS FOR SURVIVAL OF THE BRAIN AFTER DEATH KIND OF THINGS WHICH ACTUALLY HAPPEN O YOU HEARE ABOUT THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE DECLARE DEAD AND THEN CAME BACK AND THERE EXACTUALLY NOW LOT OF CROWER PRESERVATION TYPE APPROACH IS FOR THAT DISIS A AN WAY WE A RISK GOING INTO THE THE A THE ESOTERIC NOW SWELL STERE ABACK TO OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT YOUR STUDY BUT AM SO IF I DO THE MAT THESE SUBJECTS ARE IN THE COLD LET'S AY THEYRE DOING THREE ROUNDS OF COLD FOR ONE TO TWO MINUTES THREE TUP TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK WHAT WERE THE THRESHOLDS THAT YOU DISCOVERED WERE IMPORTANT FOR GETTING THESE POSITIVE CHANGES IN UM SUCH AS REDUCED BLOOD SUGAR OR CLEARANCE OF BLOOD SUGAR A BEING MORE EFFICIENT A REDUCED IN SOLENT AM IMPROVE BROWN FAT DISTRIBUTION AND DENSITY A HOW MUCH COLD EXPOSURE DO PEOPLE NEED HOW MUCH HEAT EXPOSURE TO PEOPLE NEED IN ORDER TO EXTRACT THESE BENEFITS YES THEU WHEN WETHEN CALCULATED THE NUMBERS TOGETHER WE CAN SEE THAT THIS WAS ENDED UP BEING ELEVEN MINUTES A IN TOTAL PER WEEK A SO NOT IN ONE SESSION OF COURSE BUT THEY HAD TO TO FREE VISITS TO THE WATER AND DE SONA PER WEEK SO WHEN WE DIVIDE THAT OUT IT CORRESPONDS TO BEING IN CO WATER ONE TO TWO MINUTES AT A TIME BUT ALSO IN THE SONA TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES AT A TIME AN I THINK THIS IS VERY LIKE A ALSO SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SEE IN OTHER STUDIES WHEN WE LOOK FOR EXAMPLE TO THE OBSERVATIONOL STUDIES  FROM THE FINISH A COHOR STUDY FROM A A LOWCIN IT ELL FOR EXEMBLED THAT PUBLISHED THIS VERY MACING PAPER IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN AM SOME RESORTS FROM THIS LONG COR STUDY WHERE THEY SHOW THAT AM THAT UP TO THIRTY MINUTES A IN THE SONA WAS A HEALTHY AND THEY YOU YOU LURE YOUR RISK OF CAGUBASCULINCEES AND THAT'S LIKE THE TRESSHOLD AND IF YOU GO FURTHER THAN THAT THAN THERE WAS NOT MORE A IM HEALTHY BENEFITS TO TO GAIN FROM THAT SO AND BEFORE THAT IS LIKE NINETEEN MINUTES THEN YOU WILL HAVE THIS DOSE RESPONDS RELATIONSHIP UP TO NINETEEN MINUTES THAT  REALLY INDECREASING YOUR RISK OF CARGUBESCULAR DICEASES AND I THINK WE ARE LELITTE WEEK NINEDY MINUTES PER WEEK A NINETY MINUTES PERCESSION ICESSIONLY A PERCESSION IF WE IM A THEN COMPARE THAT WITH MY STUDY WHICH WAS TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES PERSESSION THEN I THINK IT FITS VERY WELL WITH WHAT WE CALL THE HOMETIC STRESS O HEALTHY STRESS YOU EXPOSED THE CELLS TO THIS KIND OF LIKE POTENT VERY ISTRESS FOR SITUATION A WHETHEY A INCREASE HEAT SHOT PERINES IN THE CELLS AND THAT WILL REPAIR THE CELLS BUT IF YOU WITHEN OVERDO IT AND YOU GO BEYOND THERE MAY BE THIRTY MINUTES IN THE SONA THIS OBSERVATIONAL STUDY FROM A FINLAND WITH MORE THAN E OUGHT TO TWO THOUSAND SONA BATHES WIT HAVE FALL OF THESE FOR TWENTY YEARS THEY SEE THAT A THIRTY MIN IS POSSESSION IS LIKE ENOUGH AND  IF YOU GO ABOVE THAT YOU DON'T GET MORE HEALTH  BENEFITS OUT OF IT SO I THINK THAT'S THE WINDOW WHERE WE CAN SAY THE HEALTHY STRESS CORRESPONDS TO LIKE TEN MINUTES  THINK IT'S LIRSESSION PERSESSION AND IT'S NOT ITXS NOT MUCH ACTUALLY SO YOU DON'T NEED TO IT SHOWS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPOSE YOURSELF VERY MUCH TO TE HEAT OR VERY MUCH ACTUALLY TO THE COLD TO GET THIS HEALTHY A BENEFITS ER FROM ME GOING INTO COLD GOING TO HEAT AND HAVE HEALTHY BENEFITS ON YOUR COTIBESCULAR SYSTEM SO THINK THITS IS VERY IMPORTANT ALSO MESSAGE TO TO TO GET OUT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO EXTREME YOU DON'T HAVE TO A SWIM FOR  HALF AN HOUR IN THE COL WATER YOU CAN GO IN THE WATER FOR ONCE OR TWO MINUTES AN PERSESSION BUT GO UP TO ELEVEN MINUTES PER WEEK AND TOTAL AND FOR THE SON A MY STUDIES SHOWED A FIFTY SEVEN MINUTES IN TOTA PER WEEK AND IF WE ALSOR THEN DIVIDED OUT ON THESE TO TTHREE DAYS AND TWO SESSIONS EACH DAY CORRESPOND TO TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES SO IT'S A LOW TRESSOU BUT I THINK IT'S IT'S GOOD TO HAVE THAT TO MAYBE WE CAN AIM FOR THAT IF IF PEOPLE NEADS TO HAVE SOMETHING TO TO AIM FOR AND I THINK AND I THINK IT'S REALLY GOOD TO HAVE THAT BECAUSE THEN YOU YOU DON'T HAVE THEN YOU DON'T OVERDO IT AND IF YOU OVERDO IT YOU EXHAUST ESELVES AND THAT WILL INCREASE YOUR RISK OF CADUBESCO VIDICEASE ALSO SO I GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS AND I DID SOLICIT FOR QUESTIONS FOR THIS PART CASSON ON TWITTER IN ONE OF THE QUESTIONS TO DAY TOT WAS AS ONE BECOMES MORE COLD ADAPTED TO THE BENEFITS START TO WEAR OFFER CAN PEOPLE DO TOO MUCH COLD EXPOSURE OF COURSE THE ANSWER TO THAT AS YESIR YOU BECOME HYPOTHERMIC BUT I'M SENCE IN A DIFFERENT ANSWER NOW WHICH IS IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY AND THE THRESHOLD IS ELEVEN MINUTES TOTAL PER WEEK OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE DIVIDED INTO TWO OR THREE SESSIONS OF MAYBE WONE TO THREE MINUTES DEPENDING ON HOW LONG SOMEBODY SAYS IN AND THEN FIFTY SEVEN MINUTES I WANT TO BE CAREFUL NOT TA ROUND UP A TO AN HOUR BUT DIVIDED INTO MAYBE THREE TWENTY MINUTE SESSIONS OR SO YOU KNOW IM SO ONE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT AS LONGS YOU GET APMOUT BEYON THAT THRESHOLD BUT I I WONDER SOMETHING WHICH IS IS IT THE CASE THAT IF SOMEBODY SAID OH YOU KNOW I'M JUST GOING TO DO ONE ELEVEN MINUTE SESSION PER WEEK THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY NOT BE AS BENEFICIAL AS DIVIDING IT UP BECAUSE WHAT YOU TOLD US EARLIER IS THAT THE HORMETIC RESPONSE DEPENDS ON HAVING THAT COLD SHOCK YOU ECHUALLY DON'T WANT TO BECOME TOO COLD ADAPTED I MEAN ONCE THE BLOOD PRESSURE RESPONSE DROPS DOWN SO IN MINUTE FOUR FIVE AND SIX YOU'RE ETTING VERY COLD AND YOUR SHIVERING BUT YOUR ONE IS NOT GETTING THE AUTONOMIC STIMULUS THAT THEY WANT I GUESS I COULD LIKE IN THIS TO UM IF EXERCISE WORKED IN A WAY WHERE IT WAS ONLY THE FIRST FEW MINUTES OF EXERCISE THAT REALLY TRIGGERED THE ADAPTATION OF COURSE IS IS NOT HOUTWORKS BUT M IN FACT PROBLY QUITE THE OPPOSITE UM BUT IF THAT WERE THE CASE THEN IT'S NOT SIMPLY THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF EXERCISE BUT DIVIDING UP THE THE THE SESSIONS INTO LITTLE BOUTS WHERE EVERY SINGLE TIME IT ACTS AS IT AS A STIMULUS THAT SEEMS TO BE THE KEY HERE IM THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT IM BECAUSE HAVING WATCHED THE LANDSCAPE OF THIS ON SOCIAL MEDIA BUT ALSO IN BOOKS AND GENERALLY I I THINK YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON TO REALLY TOUCH ON THIS THAT THE GOAL IS NOT TO GET SO COLD ADAPTED THAT YOU CAN SIT IN FOR THE FULL ELEVEN MINUTES IN ONE SESSION WHERE THE GOAL ISN'T TO BE ABLE TO DO AN HOUR OF VERY HOT SONA IF YOU WANT TO I SUPPOSE PEOPLE COULD D IT FOR OTHER REASON BUT IF THE NOAL IS TO IMPROVE THESE HEALTH MATRICS YETHEN THE IDEAS TO KEEP THE STIMULUS A STIMULUS SHORT EXICTLY YETGREAT WILL THIS ALSO I THINK THERE'S PRACTICAL FEASIBILITY AS YOU POINTED OUT AS GETTING INTO A COLD SHOWR OR COLDIMMERSION OR NATURAL BODY WATER FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES IS FAR LESS A IM YOU KNOW CHALLENGING TO MOST PEOPLE THIN FINDING A FULL MORNING TO GO IN A SP N THEARE UM BUT I'VE NEVER REALLY HEARD IT ARTICULATED THAT THE LONGER SESSIONS MIGHT NOT BE BENEFICIAL AND MIGHT ACTUALLY BE DETRIMENTAL UM THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT A WERE THERE ANY OTHER OBSERVATIONS THAT YOU MADE UM THAT DID NOT MAKE IT INTO THE PAPER OR THAT WERE KUND OF IN THE THE MARGIAN NOTES IN TERMS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS UM IT WERE ANYTHING OF THAT SORT THERE WAS THIS RECENT STUDY AND SOLDIERS THAT TALKED ABOUT WAIHT LOSS A SORT OF A CONTROVERSIAL STUDY UM FOR LOTTER REASONS UM BUT ONE OF THINGS THEY REMARKED IN THE PAPER WAS THAT THERE WERE A LOT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL CHANGES IMPROVED BUFFERING AGAINST ANXIETY UM THEY EVEN   THE MEN AND WOMEN IN THAT STUDY UM REPORTED ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS WAS A SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SECUAL SATISFACTION OF ORT THEY DIDN'T TELL US WHAT THAT MEANT FOR THESE SUBJECTS ANDSO WE WON'T GO THERE BUT BUT A NUMBER OF SUBJECTIVE IMPROVEMENTS WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU OBSERVED OR TOOK NOTE OF IND IN YOUR STUDY THAT PERHAPS DIDN'T MAKE THE MAIN ABSTRACT BET THER WE SHOULD BE AWARE OF I YTHERE WAS THOM AM AND I'M A TO DAY I REGRET THAT I DIDN'T AMESSURE ON SLEEP FOR EXAMPLE I I FRANKLY DIDN'T REALLY THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN I GI WHEN IT ISSIGNED THE STUDY AND SO WE WERE VERY M MUCH OCCUPIED WITH THE METAPOLISM AND CANNO HAD THE THOUGHT MAYBE THIS COULD IMPACT A SLEEP QUALITY AND AND I WISH I JUST I HAD THE THOUGHT THAT WHY DON'T YOU JUST ASKED THE IN A QUESTION NOW BUT I ASKED THEM EVERY MORNING OR EVERYONE WHO WAS NOT MANY MORNE IS TO JUST TWO MORNINGSECTUALLY I'M WE MESSURED ON AND BUT THE WINDS O SWIMMERS AND TOLD US BEFORE I WROTE THEM THAT THEY HAD A REALLY GOOD E SLEEP QUALITY THE CONTOK WHO ALSO HAD THAT BUT THEY TOLD ME ON THE DAY WHEN WE MESTURED A BROWN FAT ON NA ON TE DAY AND THE NIGHT AR SO I TUALLY TWO DAYS AND TWO NIGHTS AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY DIDN'T THEY HAD A GOOD NIGHTS SLEEP BUT THEY ALSO WOKE UP SO I'S JUST TELLING ME THAT THEY ALSO HAD LIKE A QUICK WAKE UP AND THEN THEY FELL ASLEEP AGAIN EM AND THE WINTER SWIMMERS AS SO DID THEY HAVE A REALLY GOOD SLEEP SO HE S LIKE AND IN GENERAL THEY ALLS THEY SAY WE WE SLEEP VERY WELL I SLEEP VERY WELL SAID IT'S ANECDOTEDLY GENERAL IT CORRESPONDS TO WHAT I HEARD IN MY STUDY BUT NOTHING THAT I MESSURED ON AND WHICH WI COULD BE FUND TO DO IN THE FUTURE BUT WE DIDN'T MEASURE TER ON SLEEP QUALITY THAT WOULD BE HAVE BEEN A REALLY GOOD IDEA TO DO THEY ALSO TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE VERY COMFORTABLE AN WHEN THEY WERE COLD THEY THEY DON'T MIND A WINTER SWIMMERS THER DON'T MIND IM GOING OUT FOR EXAMPLE AND IN IN THE COLT WITH A TEA SHIRT THEY WERE ALSO LESS E SCARRED OFF SHOWING THE SKIM THAT AS O SO SEVECT AND ESNT TH SOR CAN OFR REDUCED SOCIAL ANXIETY YET THEY WERE JUST SO COMFORTABLE IN THE LAP YOUES YOU JUST MENTURE BEFOR COATS ON AND EVERYBUST YORNING AROUND US VERY BUSY AND AND ALL THE OTHER IN SINS TIST OUT IN THE WHOLE WAY AND THE ALSO MY SUPERVISEI HAD HER OUT OFFICE DOWN DOWN THE WHOLE WAY AND AND ONE OF THE WINTER WIMMERS ONE DAY JUST GOT OUT OF BED AFTER I HAVE BEEN IN THE STUDY FOR IT EIGHT HOURS WE THE WAS A LONG DAY RIGHT HE JUMPED OUT OF THE BED AND HAD HIS CLOTHES IN THE BATH ROOM AND HE WENT OUT COMPLETELY NAKED HE DIDN'T CARE HE JUST WENT OUT IT WAS LIKE SO THAT'S A SIDE OF FACT RA OF GETTING A TOO COMFORTABLE WHAT I COLLD ON I WERE NOT RECOMMENDING THAT NOW THOUGH IN YOUR BOOK YOU UM DID THEY A YOU DEDICATED SOME LL ME SAID TH E AGAIN ALTHOUGH IN YOUR BOOK YOU DEDICATED SOME A PAGES TO UM NAKED WINTER SWIMMING WORK I SHOULD SAY NAKED COLD WATER EXPOSURE AS OPPOSED TO UM A WITH BATHING SUIT YE ARE THERE ANY DATA ON THIS OBSERVED CHARING BUN UM I THINK IT IN MOST PLACES IN THE UNITED STATES ITS I SKINNY DIPPING IS NOT AM IS NOT LEGAL A MOST PUBLIC BEACHES THER ARE FEW IN FACT WHEREI MY LABORATORY BEFORE MOVING A STAMFORD WAS IN SANIEGO AND I AT THE SALK INSTITUTE FOR MIOLOGICAL STUDIES BEAUTIFUL BUILDING INCREDIBLE SCIENCEIS DONE THERE THE BEACH RIGHT BELOW THAT IS CALLED BLACKSBEACH AND UM AND IT'S A NO NEWD BEACH UM AND SO WHENEVER TOURISTS WERE HADING DOWN THE STAIRWAY THERE UM I WOULD YOURSERVE LET THEM KNOW ESPECIAL IF THEY HAD KIDS ID LET TEM KNOWG YET T AND IT'S A NEW BEACH OF A PARTICULAR UM OF A PARTICULAR JONERUS I I GIVE THEM ALLO WARNING ABOUT WHAT WHAT THEY COULD EXPECT DOWN BELOW IT'S E UM IN ANY EVENT THOSE THOSE BEACHES ARE QUITE RARE UM IN THE UNITED STATES MAY BE COMPARED TO EUROPE I DON'T KNOW UM BUT MYESO IS THERE ANYTHING SPECIAL ABOUT AM CLOTHELESS VERSES CLOTHED AM EXPOSURE YOU HAVE THINKIN IN THAT SENSE EWE AVE BE MORE FREE WITH THIS KIND OF LIKE BU BUT REMEMBER WE ALSO HAVE THIS WINTER SWIMMING COLSURE FOR SO UP A HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND THEN MINE AND THE WNC IT THE OLDEST WINTER SWIMMING CLUBS THAT WE HAVE ESPECIALLY THE ONE WE HAVE IN COPENHAY CAN WHERE I DID MY NEXT STUDY WHICH WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT BUT AND ITS ALSO NOT PUB PUBLISHED YET BUT AND IN THAT WEN TO SWIMMING CLUB IT'S THE OLDEST ONE WE HAVE IN ITS HUTE AND THIS THI SWIM NAKED AT IT IS E FACILITY MEN AND WOMEN MEN AND WOMEN AND THEY HAVE SA NO WHERE THEY CAN GO IN TOGETHER AND I ALSO HAVE THE SEPARATES ON US BUT IT'S VERY MUCH I A DANISH THING AND AND I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S GOOD IF PEOPLE WANT THAT AND AND I HAD IT IN MY BOOK BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW IF THEY HAVE TO SWIM WITH THEIR BATING SUIT ON OR IF THEY CAN TAKE IT OFF OR WHAT TE WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IS THE ANY DIFFERENCE IN THIS AND IF YOU ASK ME THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IF YOU HAVE YOUR LITTLE SKINTY BEKINYON IS NOT GOING TO DO ANY DIFFERENCE TO YOUR A COLD EXPOSURE OR YOURE ADAPTATION IS NOT GOING TO DO ANY DIFFERENCE FOR YOUR BENEFITS OF COURSE BUT I THINK THAT IT HAS SOMETHING ELSE IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH HOW YOU ALSO UPSERT YOURSELF HOW YOU U SUET YOUR SURROUNDINGS  IS  SOME SI SOME SEME O FREEDOM AND SKINNY DIPPING SO I THINK PEOPLE IN BEN MA CUDUSTIS IS THEY DO DO WENT TO SWIMMING BECAUSE THEY FEEL FREE WHEN THEY DO THEY TO COME HOME FROM WHERK THEY GO TO THIS CLUB AND THEY SKINNY DIP AND THEY FEEL LIKE IN TOUCH WITH NATURE AND THEY'VE MAY BE DONE THIS THE WHOLE LIFE SO THIS IS AN OLD TRADITION AND DEN MAK IN SOME OF THE CLUBS AN BUT THE NEW YORK CLUBS THERE COMING THEY DON'T STEY DON'T A SKINNY DIV SO EVERY ONE HAS BATHING SUIT I NEVER SKINNYDIP BECAUSE THE PEOPLE AEROUND PEOPLE WITH PHONES AND TAKEN PRECIOUS OLD I TIME SO THIS IS DIFFERENC DIFFERENT NOWADAYS EVERYTHNG NI'TE REFRINENTE YET YA AND OH SO TIS THIS OLD TRADITION IS SASO FATING AWAY BECAUSE OF THAT YE I UM I YOU SAWNAN OLD AT HOME BUT WHEN I TRAVEL THER THERE'S A A BNYA SO RUSSIAN BONIA HAS HOTSONA AND COLD PLUNGE M THERE'S ONE IN SAMICISCO CALLED ARCHIMADES BONYA  AND THAT ONE IS CLOTHING OPTIONAL SO SOME PEOPLE ARE CLOTHES SUCH AS MYSELF AND THEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE NOT AND IT'S COED MOST OF THE TIME I THINK THEY HAVE MEL A FEMALE SEPARATED A EVENINGS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEN UM THE OTHER BONAS SPY EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH IS N ON WALL STREET IN NEW YORK IS AN AMAZING BONA AS WELL U AND THESE ARE TRYING TO CROP UP IN DIFFERENT CITIES OR MAYBE THEY'VE BEEN THERE FOR A LONG TIME AND AS THE LIBERAT COLD EXPOSURE AND SON A GETS MORE POPULAR MORE PEOPLE ARE USING THEM THA THE ONE IN NEW YORK THAT I THAT A SPIDY IS ALWAYS CLOTHED U AND THAT IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU KNOW PEOPLE HERE A NAKED OR SKINNY DIPPING AND THAT THEY THEY MIGHT GET CERTAIN IDEAS IN MIND IT UM YE ALL THESE PLACES ARE VERY WELL LIT AND THEY ALL HAVE A TONE OF KIND OF A OF HEALTH THAT IS ABOUT THE KIND OF HEALTH AND AND AND WELLNESS  I GUESS THE POINT BEING THAT UM THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT A TO DO ONE THING OR THE OTHER UM ALTHOUGH IN THE STUDIES THAT A YOU DID OBVIOUSLY UM PEOPLE WERE CLOTHED BUT I I DID UM I DID PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE PAGES IN YOUR BOOK THO N ISTIN THA YOU PUT SOM UM SOME DEDICATED A PASSAGES IN YOUR BOOK OF RELATION TO THIS AND I THINK IT MY PUBLISH O ANEE THAT O YOU NO A A A I WAS NOT ME AN LIKE  Y PUBLISH A REALLY ANTID TO HAVE A LITTLE DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT E LIKE OKE WEL I THINK IT YOU KNOW POINTS TO A LARGER THEME WHICH AS I THINK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ALREADY DO THESE PRACTICES UM THERE'S NO SHOCK THERE UM FOR PEOPLE THAT DO NOT DO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE OR SANA I THINK THAT UM YOU KNOW THERE IS THI S IDEA PERHAPS THAT OWIUG O THESE ARE UM TRADITIONS THAT ARE ARE KIND OF FRINGE OR THAT THEY'RE CUT AND I JUST I WANTED UM CU THAT POINT BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH AND MEDICINE IUNO SERIOUS QUALITY PUREVIEWED STUDIES PUBLISH AN EXCELLENT JOURNALS LIKE YOUR PAPER ON THINGS LIKE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE SANA UM THE USE OF PARTICULAR SUPPLEMENTS NATURAL NATURAL HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS AN ME THE'S ENTIRE BRANCH OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH INTHE UNITED STATES DEDICATED JUST TO THE STUDY OF SUPPLEMENTS AND BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS FOR HEALTH LIKE MEDITATION AND BREATHWORK BLECREDIBLE SO INCREDIBLE AND PSYCHODELICS OF COURSE BEING SOMETHING THAT FOR A LONG TIME WAS PART OF A CERTAIN COMMUNITY AND FEEL AND NOW IS BEING U FRANKLY ADOPTED BY MAINSTREAN MED MEDICINE EVEN FARMA SO IT THA THE TIMES ARE CHANGING UM AND SO A YES I THING IT'S IMPORTEN TO KNOW THAT UM IT'S PERFECTLY ACCEPTABBLE AND ENCOURAGED TO WEAR CLOTHING ABSOLUTELAN ABSOLUTELY  NN ONE OTHER THING THAT'S I WANTED TO TO MENTION GOING BACK TO YOUR QUESTIONS AROUND WITH THERE WERE ANY OBSERVATIONS AN THE STUDIES WHICH WE REALLY MAYBE HAVING DISCUSSED YET UM MAYBE IT'S IN IN THE BACK OF THE THE PAPER I'M NOT MENTIONED THAT MUCH WAS ON OF THE WINCE TO SWIMMUS DIDN'T HAVE ANY BROWN FAT WHEN WE MEASURED HIM ZERO CERO AND E IN WE DO SEE THIS IM IN IN IN PREVIOUS STUDIES AS WELL THAT SOME HUMANS DON'T HAVE ANY BROWN FAT WAS HE DID HE CARRY WOT OF WHITE FAT AT OF WAS TO SHO WAS HE WAS HE OBES NO HE WASN'T KNOW HE WAS NOT OBISE BECAUSE THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE STUDY THEM I ALL RIGHT A YES YE MENTION IS TERWELD FR HIM AN KNOWO BUT HE WAS THEM BUT WHAT I DID UBSERVE BEFORE I KNEW THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY BROWN FOR WAS THAT DURING THE COOLING EXPERIMENT WHERE I COOLED THEM FOR E TWO HOURS BEFORE THEY GO INTO THE PETSYTY SCANNER E HE WAS NOT ABLE TO CONTROL HIS A SHIVERING LIKE THE WINTER SWIMMERS I COULD SO HE GOT HE GOT VERYE A COLD VERY EASILY I COMPARED TO THE OTHERS SO AND WITHOUT OUR DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS DIFFERENT ABOUT HIM BUT WE COULD L ALL OR ME AND THE THREE OTHERS WERE WORKING ON EXPERIMENT WE WERE LIKE OKE WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE WE TURNED DOWN THE TEMPERATURE BUT HE STARTED LIKE SHIVERING AND THEN WE HAD TO TURN IT UP AGAIN AND IT WAS JUST ALL OVER THE PLACE THE TEMPERATURE IS NOT IT WASN'T THAT CONTROLLED LIKE THE OTHERS WAS PRETTY SIMILAR PROTECOL I COULD JUST DO PRETTY MUCH THE SAME BECAUSE THERE WASE SAME SIZE AND E ALSO SAID JAMEDER SO IT IT IT WAS EASIER E TO LIKE FORESEE WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN WILL TEY START SHIVER I QUICKLY LEARNED THAT BUT WITH THIS SUBJECT IT WAS JUST WITH TO SAY VOLUNTEER WAS JUST VERY MUCH DIFFERENT AND THEN WHEN WE SCANNED HIM AND DIDN'T FIND ANY BROWND FOR I I I DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT SO WHEN WE SCANNED HIM WE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING I TOLD THE PETSI SEE PEOPLES WHO LIKE OH YOU PUT UP THE WRONG ESCANNIER IT WASN TITS ACKNOWLEDG YE IT TIN IACKNOWLEDGY WAS LIKE THIS SCANNING LOOK LIKE THE THIRM A NEUTRAL DAY THE THIRM COMFORTABLE DAY WHEN WE ALSO SCANNED THEM TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY BROWN FAT SO YOU HAD MADE A MISTAKE I WAS PRETTY SURE AND THE REANALYS ANAL ANALYZED THIS IM SCANNING AND THEY JUST CONCLUDED WELL IT THE SCANNING WAS FINE THE EXPERIMENT WENT WELL IT WAS JUST THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY BROWN FAT SO HE WAS LIKE WHAT WE JUST IN THE PAPER CALLED AT A BROWN FAT NEGATIVE SO HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY AND IN  MICER STUDIES I WOULD BE CALLED A KNOCKR OUT SO HET DIDN'T HAVE ANY BROWN FAN SO WUT THE OBSERVATION WITH HIM AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE THAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT HE BOTH SHIVERED VERY EARLY ON AND DIDN'T REGULATE HIS TEMPERATURE AS WELL HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT THEN HE WAS LIKE A FIVE ON THE SCALE OF HOW COMFORTABLE HE FELT WITH THE COLD AN E SO IT WAS FROM ONE TO TEN AND FIVE BEING SO MORE COMFORTABLE AND TAND BEING A VERY A COLD E AND AND ONE VERY THOUGHT SO ON THIS S LIKE SCALE OF AN OP AND DOWN AND HE HE WAS LIKE MORE UP AND DOWN ON THIS SCALE THAN ANY OF THE OTHES IT WAS AN OBSERVATION THAT I DID AND BUT WE DID SEE IN HIS BLOOD SAMPLES ALSO THAT HIS BLOOD SAMPES LOOKED A BIT MORE LIKE THE CONTROL GROUP AND ALSO HIS I INSOLENT LEVELS WERE LIKE THE CONTROL GROUPS O A LA BIT HIGHER THAN THE OTHER WINTER SWIMMERS AND HE ALSO HAD AN A A A EHE HIS BLOCK TLO COAST CLEARANCE WAS NOT AS THE FAST AS SIM AS THE HE THE OTHER WINTER SWIMMERS SO HE WAS LIKE AN OUTLIER WHAT WE CALL IT AND INDIANALYSIS WE ALSO HAD TO TAKE HIM OUT E OF THE ANALYSIS BECAUSE HE WAS AN OUTLIER AND SO THE RESOLTS SHOWING THAT THE BROWN FAT E IS A MORE EFFICIENTLY ACTIVATEIT IN THE WINTER SWIMMERS IS WITHOUT HIM HAVING HIM IN THAT GROUP THOUG IT DIDN'T RUIN US THE STUDY IF I TRIED TO PUT HIM M IN AS WELL AND DIDN' IT DIDN'T RUIN THE RESULTS OR ANYTHING BUT JUST TO TO KEEP IT MORE CLEAR WE PUT WE TO COME OUT OF THE ANALYSIS YES HEAS A ME UTENT A NOCKAND I'M SURE THERE OUT THERE A VERY INTERESTING SO FEW SIVER EARLY AM THEN PERHAPS YOU HAVE LESS BROWN FAT TO BEGIN WITH ALL THATS HARD TO CONCLUDE FROM ONE PERSON THAT SORT OF THE THE THE IMPLICATION THERE ARE YOU HAVE AN ADAPTED TO THE COT SO YOU MUSHT IT BUILD THAT OUTNER YET IGHT SO IN ADDITION TO LOOKING AT REGULATION OF BLOOD SUGAR ROUND THAT METABOLISM AND SO ON WERE THERE ANY MARKERS THAT YOU EXAMINED IN THE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE GROUP AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS A THAT REVEAL TO YOU THAT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE COULD HAVE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS IMSAY FOR I A MEAN SYSTEM FUNCTION IM OR FOR ANY FUNCTION FOR THAT MATTER YES SO FOR IMWE LOOKED AT ININFLAMMATION OF COURSE MEASURE OUT TE OUTCOME OF LOT PRESSURE AND SO ON BUT WE ALSO MEASURED THE ILE SIX IN THE STUDY JUST TO SEE ALSO AND INFLAMMATORY AND INFLAMMATORY MARGRE SO IL SIX WENT UP ANDED ALSO FOLLOWS WITH THE ILE TEN SO THAT IS LIKE IS ALSO VERY KNOWN IN TH LITERATURE SO WE MEASURED THAT AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO TO THINK ABOUT THE COLD EXPOSION TE HEAT EXPOSURE AS SOMETHING THAT THEN LOWERS THE INFLAMMATION IN THE BODY AND WOULH IF WE CAN DO THAT WE WILL HAVE AN OPEN DOOR FOR AN A PREVENCING LIFESTYLE DECEASE IS RIN SO FOR AN TYPTU DIABEDIS BUT ECTUALLY ALSO FOR SOME MENSO A DECEASES AS WELL SO AS KNOWN AS DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY AND ALSO ELSETIME IS DECEASE WE SHARE ALL ASSOCIATED AND IN RESEARCH ALSO NEW A RESER SHOWING THAT A THAT INFLAMMATION INCREASES THE RISK OF DEPRESSENTING SIET AND AND ELSE IMUS IVIN NOLOGICAL DECEASES SO WE CAN DECREASE INFLAMMATION IN THE BODY WE WILL DECREASE OR MODERN LIFESTALE DE CEASES BUT ALSO THESE INCREASING A E A MENTAL DECEASES THAT WE SEE IN THESE MODERN LIFESTILL TIMES AN SO I THINK THAT IT'S I THINK ITS VERY INTERESTING THAT WE CAN O OUT IN NATURE AND WE CAN USE THESE NATURAL STRESSERS AND T IT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE IT SOUND VERY ROMANTIC OR ANYTHING IT'S JUST IT'S JUST EXPOSURE TO TEMPERATURE ACTUALLY JUST A COLD OR TO HEAT THAT ITS GON ED T WORK OUR BODY INTO AN NATURAL STATE AGAIN AND AND RE SAID IT WERE THE TTHE HOMERSTASES THE BALANCE HAS IS LOST A BIT SO THE BODY IS GONE TO REPAIR ITSELF IN THAT WAY AND NOTHING IS BEAUTIFUL THAT WE CAN DO THAT JUST BY CHANGING THE TEMPERATURE OF OUR BODY AND ALTHOUGH PEOPLE ARE VERY SCARED OF DOING THIS BECAUSE IN OUR TIMES WE HAVE BEEN A WAY FROM COD AWAY FROM HEAT TEMPERATURE IF FOR SOME FOR DECATES NOW AM SINCE WE ISOLATED OUR HOUSES BETTER AND TERE WE ARE MORE SEDENTARY WE ALWAYSO SIT MORE ENDOOR WE DON'T MOVE AS MUCH SO TIS VERY IM MODERN SEDENTARY LIVE STYLE HAS MADE US MORE TEMPERATURE COMFORTABLE JUST NEUTRAL SO NO NO WONDER I MEAN THAT UBISITY IS INCREASING WE DON'T EXPOSED OURSELF TO THE NATURALSTESSES THAT WE DID EARLIER ON AM IN IN OUR EMBONEMENT BUT US OOPONTE MAY BE THE SEVENTIES THE SIXTIES WHERE WE STARTED HAVING MORE LIKE A COMFORTABLE LIVE STYLES RIGHT AND UBICITY INCREASES IN THE IN THE EIGHTIES WE CAN SEE THAT FROM STATISTIC SO I THINK THAT IF WE CAN TAKEN COLD AND HEAT AND YOU MENTIONED OTHER THINGS ALSO BEFORBUT OF COURSE EXERCISES VERY IMPORTANT HERE AND ALSO A BIT OF FASTING ACTUALLY BECAUSE IT ALL INCREASES THE HOMETIC STRESS IN THE BODY SO IT'S DOESN'T HAVE TO BE OTHER THAN NATURAL STRESSES TO THE BODY WHICH THAN COULD KEEP US IN THAT NATURAL BALANCE AGAIN COULD WE TALK ABOUT WHAT I REFERRE TO AS THE SOBEREN PRINCIPLE WHICH IS TE END ON COLD AND THE REASON I CALL IT THE SOBER PRINCIPLES BECAUSE AN IN REVIEWING O BY THE WEE WASN'T A OFFICIAL REVIEWER OF YOUR PAPER BUT I MEAN IN READING AND AM REVIEWING YOUR PAPER FOR IT'S AFTER PUBLISHED CONTENTS I NOTICE THAT YOU HAD PEOPLE END ON COLD AND THIS HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING DEBATE IN THE THE ADELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE COMMUNITY SHOULD YOU WARM UP IN IT WITH A WARM SHOWER AFTERWARDS O GET BACK IN THIS HONOUR WHAT SHOULD OU AND ON COLDER END ON HEAT AND THE SOBER PRINCIPLE SAYS END ON COLD AS I UNDERSTAND IT IN ORDER TO FORCE YOUR BODY TO HEAT ITSELF BACK UP AND THEREBY INCREASE METABOLISM FURTHER STILL IS THAT RIGHT YES SO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU END ON THE COLD YOU YOU FORCE YOUR BODY TO HEAT UP BY ITSELF AND THAT WILL REQUIRE THAT YOU EXIBATE YOU KEEP YOUR BROWN FIT EXHIBATED AND ALSO YOUR MUSCLES WHICH IS A GOOD THING IT'S A GOOD COLLEBORATION TO KEEP YOUR THEMAGENESTISELF AND THAT'S LIKE AND AND EXERCISE EVEN WHEN YOU GO HOME SO IN THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT YOUR COLD EXPOSURE DIPPING IN IN YOUR PLUNCH A WWIL CAN SEE YO WHAT IT IS AS JUST A AND EXERCISE THAT YOU DO FOR ONE TO TWO MINUTES AND THAN I'S OVER IF YOU I END ON THE COLD YOU HAVEN'T EXERCISE FOR YOUR BODY GOING ON FOR HOURS AFTERWARDS AND THAT'S NOT ONLY ON YOUR METAPOLISM BUT IS ALSO GOING TO KEEP YOURE NEW TRANSMITTERS I EXHIBATED AS WELL AND INCREASE THAT BECAUSE YOUR BODY IS STILL COLD SO YOU NEED THAT I EX THOSE NETRANCEMITTED TO EXIBATE THE BROWN FEATES WELL SO THAT'S GOING TO MAKE YOUR BROWN FETS AS MORE EFFICIENT AND ALSO YOUR MUSTER SELLS MORE EFFICIENT SO INCREASING MYH CONJURE AND SELVES WHICH WILL THEN GENERATE HEAT VERY FAST SO IF YOU HAVE DONE THIS FOR FEW TIMES SO MAY BE THREE FOR FIVE TIMES AND BEIN NEW TO THIS BUT HAVE TRIED IT A FEW TIMES YOU WEN NOTICE AS WITCH WHERE YOU LIKE FEEL THAT YOU GET EASIERLY WARMER AND YOU CAN KEEP YOURSELF WARMER AND THAT IS ALSO WHAT WE SHOWN AND IN MY STUDY IS THAT THE THE WENTER SWIMMERS WERE PHYSICALLY A WARMER ON THE SKIN COMPARE TO THE CONTROL GROUP SO THAT WEND THEY ARE OUT OF THE COLD WHEN THEY ARE OUT OF THE COLD JUST RELAX THING AND WE TESTED THIS AN IN ON THE DAYS WHEN THEY WERE SLEEPING IN THE LAP SO WE COULD SEE THAT THEY HAD AND MORE ACCIBATION OF THE BROWN FAT HIGHER TEMPERATURE SO PROBABLY BECAUSETHEY ALL SO LOOSE HEAT IT TEY HAVE HIGH HEAP LOSS TO THE BODY A COMPAT TO THE CONTROL GROUP AN BECAUSE TO HAVE A MORE BESCULAR A SKIN T BECAUSE OF THE CONTRAST OF COLD AND HEAT SO THEY LOOSE HEAT FASTER FROM THE BODY DURING THAT DAY BUT IS THAT A BAST THING NO PROBABLY NOT BECAUSE THAT'S GONE TO KEEP YOUR BROWN FAT AND YOUR MOSS AS ILUPID ACTIVATED SO WE YOU WOULD HAVE TO IT IT HAS TO WORK TO KEEP YOU WARM AND I WOULD HYPOTHESIZED THAT IT ALSO MIGHT LEAD TO SOME OF THE UM SUBJECTIVELY REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS AND SLEEP BECAUSE IN ORDER TO FALL ASLEEP YOU NEED YOUR CORE BODY TEMPERATURE TO DROP BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES YES SO IT'S NOT JUST SUFFICIENT TO BE SLEEPING IN A COLD ROOM AND UNDER THE BLANKET YOU ALSO NEED YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE TO DROP YES AND SO WHAT YOUR A SANUFI NDERSTAND CORRECTLY IS THAT BY FORCING BY ENDING ON COLD AND FORCING ONESELF TO HEAT UP NATURALLY AM THAT INCREASES THE BROWN FAT STORES WHICH I SER SEE AS A COME LIKE THE OIL IN THE CANDLE OF THE FURNACE THAT IS THERMOGENESIS AND THAT IN TURN LEADS TO INCREASED HEAT LOSS WHICH PEOPLE MIGHT THINK O I DON'T WANT LOSE HEAT FROM THE BODY BUT YET THERE AREN'T TOME AN WANT TO LOSE AND FROM THE BODY BUSY IT SOUNDSLY WHAT WE WANT IS TO BE A VERY EFFICIENT HEATING AND COOLING SYSTEM YES THAT IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING COLD OR BEING HOT IT'S REALLY ABOUT KEEPING THE SYSTEM TUNED WELL KEEPING THE OIL IN THE CANDLE IS BROWN FAT AM FUNCTIONING YES WHENCOULD ASK ONE QUESTION ABOUT UM FED OR FASTED IS THERE ANY R RATHER ARE THERE ANY KNOWN BENEFITS OF DOING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND ORSAN A FASTED AVERSIS AM AFTER A A MEAL SAY WITHIN THE LAST HOUR SOMETHING O THAT SORT I DO MY DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING UM SO IN GENERAL AND FASTICAUSE I DON'T ETEN TOL BIT LATER IN THE DAY A BUT WHAT'S KNOWN ABOUT THAT AND WAS THAT LOOKED AT IN YOUR STUDY I KNOW YOU MEASURED GLUECOS BUT THAT WAS AS A SEPARATE UM TUS I WE AT FROM THE COLD I WAY FROM THE CODIA BUT I WAS SOBTESTED BLUCOS ON THE DAYS ON THE COLD SO WE MISSE YIP THAT AS WELL AN ON THE COOLING DAYS EM SPECIFICALLY ON FASTING AND FAT I DON'T KNOW I DON'T THINK THAT I H'VE SEEN STUDIES SPECIFICALLY ON THIS UM MORE SCIENCE NEEDED UM A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ASK ABOUT THE USE OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE TO OFF SET SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS OF VARIOUS DISEASES NOW HEARE WE'RE NOT TELLING ABOUT CURING DISEASE WERE TAING OU OFFSETTING SYMPTOMS UM ONE QUESTION I'VE SEEN QUITE OFTEN IS WHETHER NOT PEOPLE WITH RAINOD SINDRUM THIS IS A SINDRUM AND MY HA SCHOOL GIRLFOR HAD THE SINDRUM AND I'LL NEVER FORGET A WE WENT ER AT A SCHOOL DANCE TOGETHER AND UM THIS WAS WHEN WE FIRST STARED DATING AND A SHE HAD RAIN NOTES WHICH A LEADS TO VERY POOR BLOOD FLOWED TO THE THE O THE EXTREMITIES AND  AND SHE WAS VERY CULZER SHE LEFT TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND WARM UP HER HANDS IN THE WARM WATER AND I WAS LEFT STANDING THERE AT THE DANCE AND PEOPLE CAME UP TO ME AND ASKED YOU KNOW WHY I WAS THERE AND WHO I WAS THERE WITH AND I KEPT TELLING THEM WHO I WAS WITH AND THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE ME  THEY COLDN'T BELIEVE THAT SHE WOULD BE MEMADE TOTAL SENSE IF I KNEW ME AT THE TIME U I WAS I I WAS WAY OUT OF MY LEAGUE WITH HER U AT THE TIME I LIKE TO THINK OF VENTUALLY I CAUGHT UP BUT IN ANY CASE UM A SHE WAS IN THE BATHROOM FOR ABOUT AN HOUR SAW AT ONE POINT I DID CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY THAT SHE HAD JUST LEUFT BUT INDEED SHE HAD'T SHE WARMED HER HANDS BACK UP BUT PEOPLE WITH RAINOWD SOFFERER FROM THIS UM FROM THIS THING A VERY VERY COLD  EXTREMITIES BE UM THEIR FINGER TIPS WILL EVEN TURN BLUE UM YOU KNOW AS IF THEY WERE STARTING TO GET FROSBITTEN IT'S QUITE DRAMATIC UM AN THAT QUESTION GETS ASKED WHETHER NOTHERS ANY USE OF COLD TO TRY AND INCREASE THE OM ELASTICITY THE PLASTICITY OF THE OF THE AR SMALL CAVALARIES AN VESSELS BY EVERYTHING YOU'VE DESCRIBED AM OP UNTIL NOWITSENS LIKE THAT WOULD BE A LOGICAL THING TO DO OM AND IN ADDITION TO THAT WEATHER OR NOT PEOPLE WITH AUTOMUN CONDITIONS PEOPLE WITH O ANY OTHER TYPES OF CONDITIONS ARE KNOWN TO BENEFIT FROM DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY STUDIES BUT I GET ASKED ABOUT THIS A LOT AND THEY WERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS FOR YOU IN IN THE TIRTER STEET YETHANK YOU FOR THOSE QUESTIONS AN I GET THEM AS WELL ON SOCIAR MEDIA AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT I I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY STUDIES DIRECTED ON THIS OUTCOME AND MESSURING RONUITS A CYNTRUM AND I DO KNOW THAT IT'S IT'S  IT'S NOT THAT RAY I ACTUALLY A PROBLEM AND I KNOW THAT MANY WOMEN AR MORE MEN WOMEN THAN MEN E SUFFER FROM THIS AND BUT LOGICALLY IT WOULD HELP THEM IF THEY EXPOSE THEIR HANDS TO COLD AND ALSO HEED TO MAKE THE VEST IT MORE BESCULAR BUT AND I HAVE HURT FROM PEOPLE SAYING THAT IT HAD HELP THEM BUT ALSO HURT FOR SOME OTHERS SAYING IT DIDN'T HELP THEM SO STUDIES ARE NEEDED ON THIS SPECIFIC TUPAG I THINK I HERD MY HANDS WHEN I GO INTO THE COAN I DON'T HAVE THIS CNDRAM AT OWN I BUT I KEEP MY HANDS ABOVE THE WATER YOU DO YE OH I DO THAT AN OFTEN I TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A SWIM AND THEN OF COURSE I HAVE TO HAVE MY HANDS IN THE WATER I BUT IT HELPS ME WHEN I THEN GET BACK TO THE DEADY AN AND THEN TAKE MY HANDS OFF BECAUSE THEN I CAN STAND THERE FOR A LITTLE BIT AND GET MI ONE TO TWO MINUTES EXPOSURE AND THEN I CAN GO OF BECAUSE THEN OTHERWISE THAT WOULD STOP ME FROM IT BEING IN THE WATER ENOUGH TIME THAT I AS LONG AS I I WOULD LIKE TO SO PEOPLE SUFFER FROM HAVING THIS PAIN IN THE FINGERS AND IT THAT IT CAN BE BETTER INTENSE SO JUST TAKE THE HANDS OP A BIT FROM THE WATER AND THE AND THAT'S GONG TO HELP YOU ALSO HICHS NEAR PRIN BOOTS I'S GON O HELP ON DEFEET SOME PEOPLE HAVE THE E AN FEEL THE PAIN IN THE FEET AND IN THE ANKLES AND THAT'S GONE TO HELP THEM A SOOT OF BIT CSO THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH KEEPING HANDS OUT OR FEET INNA NEAR PRIM BOOTIES IT IF PEOPLE FEEL THE NEED TO DO THAT IF THAT'S TH WHAT THE IF IN A PAIN OF THE HANDS OR FEET IS A BERIER FOR PEOPLE DOING A DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE THAN IT SEEMS IT WOULD BE OK TO DO AT TO KEEP HANDS OUT OR TO KEEP YOUR FEET YES BECAUSE THEN YOU YOU DO GET THE EXPOSURE I THOUGHT OF COURSE HANDS AND FEET ARE VERY PODENT A PLACES IN YOUR BODY TO GET A FAST EXIVATION E OFF YOURET NERVOUS SYSTEM OF COURSE BUT IF YOU CAN JUST YOU CAN ALSO JUST DIP THEM AND AND TAKE THEM UP IT'S GONSTILK GON A EXIVATE THAT BUT YOU HAVE YOUR FULL BODY IS COVERED IN IN A COPE RECEPTIRS YOU'LL HAVE A FULL EXIVATION ANYWAYS SO YOUVE YOU MAYARE PROVIDING VERY REASSURING INFORMATION TO PEOPLE CAUSE I KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT DO NOT LIKE TO PUT THEIR HANDS AND I FIND THAT THE MORE OF MY BODY I GET IN THE MORE COMFORTABLE I AM PSYCHLE I DO'T KNOW WHAT PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND OR PHYSIOLOGICALLY I FIND THAT IF WHERE THERE'S AN INTERFACE BETWEEN THE WATER AND THE COLD IT'S MOST UNCOMFORTABLE SO I PROVERE JUST GET EVERYTHING UNDER I KEEP MY HEAD OUT ALTHOUGH I THESE DAYS I'VE BEEN DUNKING ALL THE WAY IN AND THEN COMING OUT AND THE DUNKING ONCE MORE WITH MY HEAD UNDER BEFORE I GET OUT AFTER THE THE PLUNGE A THAT RAIS A DIFFERENT QUESTION NOW WE'REGETTING INTO CINT OF THE PRACTICCALITIES OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE WHICH I THINK ARE ARE IMPORTANT ASOMETIMES I'LL EXPERIENCE AND I HER FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT THEY'LL GET A KIND OF BACK OF THE HEAD HEADACHE AT THE INTERFACE OF THE OF THE WATER IM YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE IN DOING COLD IMERSION TO THE NECK A NO  I ASSOON THIS HAS TO DO WITH BLOOD FLOW THAT THERE'S VAS OF CONSTRICTION RIGHT UP UNTIL THE NACK AND IN THE REGION SURROUNDING IT BUT THAT MAY BE THERE STILL BLOOD FLOW TO THE HEAD BUT DO WE KNOW WHAT THE ORIGIN OF THESE UM HEADACHES IS AND AGAIN THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN FOR EVERYBODY BUT SOME PEOPLE DO EXPERIENCE O  YE I HAVEN'T REALLY HEARD ABOUT THAT ONE SPECIFICALLY AN SO BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT REASONS FOR MAY BE KEEPING YOUR HEAD OUT OF THE WATER AN BUT IT SEEMS I MAY BE FOR SOME THAT COULD BE A REASON FOR LIKE JUST GETTING LIKE A QUICKHEAD DUNK GOING ALL THEWAY AND YES YES WHAT I'VE STARTED DOING GAN LIMINATE IIT WASN'T GETTING HEADACHES BUT I DID I NOTICE THAT INTERFACE O C AND I WASN'T IN THE REST OF THE EXPERIENCE IT SO MUC EXPERIENCE OF IT SO MUCH SO I SURRIED DUNKING ALL THE WAY AND I NOTICED IN SOME OF THE PHOTOES THAT YOU'VE PUT OUT AMAND IN YOUR BOOK THAT YOU'LL SOMETIMES WER A CAP YET WHILE YOU GO IN YE FOQUETT AND WELL IT COMES FROM DIFFERENT REASONS AR SO LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL REASON SO WHEN YOU SUBMERG IN COLD WATER UP TO THE NECK AND STUDY HAVE SHOWN AND THIS IS FROM DENMARK STUDIES FROM A BESEFIPYA HOSPITAL AN THAT'S A WHEN YOU SUBMERGE INTO COL WATER UP TO THE NECK AT CERO DEGREES AS SO SER DEGREE CELSIEAS VERY COND AND YOU HAVE A DECREASE BLOOT FLOW TO THE BRAIN BY AROUND THIRTY TO FORTY PER CENT AND MAKE SENSE BECAUSE YOU ACTIPATE THE SYMPATHETIC NEVOU SYSTEM AAND AND THEREFORE YOUWIL HAVE A LESS BLOT FLOW TO THE BRAIN MAKES YOU MAYBE A LIBIT THIS E YEAR AND PROOF AGAIN THAT YE YOU NEED A HEART MORE THAN A BRAIN BECAUSEWHEN THE SYMATHIIC NERVOUS SYSTEM GETS ACTIVATED A BLOOD FLOW IS MAINTAINED TO THE HEART TO KEEP YOU ALIVE WUT OBVIOUSLY TAKEN AWAY FROM THE BRAIN TO KEEP YOU FROM THINKING THAT'S WIT'S HARD TO THINK WHEN YOURE STRUST YOU AT THE MUSCLES AND THEN THEN YOUR VITAL ORGANS NEED TO YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO RUN AWAY FROM THAT TIGER WI LIK THE RATIO NOW  AS TOTAL FANCY WHO AM I TO DISAGREE WITH MOTHER NATURE WELL BUT YES SO ONE OF THE REASONS BEING THAT YOU SHOULD KEEP YOUR HEAD OUT OF THE WATER IS THAT YOU COULD INCREASE THAT BLOI DECREASE IN BLOOT FLOAWT TO THE BRAIN FURTHER IF YOU DONT THE HEAT SO THEREIS IS A VERY NICE PAPER FROM AN FROM A AA RESUCH CROUP IN CANNADA WHERE THEY HAVE COLLECTIVELY LOOKED AT DIFFERENT PAPERS WHERE THEY A COMPARED HEAT LAWS IN A CREW IN THE PAPERS WHERE THEY DUNK THEHEAD AND COMPARED TO HEAT LAWS A SUBMERGING UP TO THE NECK TO SEE HOW MUCH EXTRA HEAT TO WE LOOSE FROM AUR COR WHEN WE DONT THE HEAD SO E AND NO THING IS VERY INTERESTING THAT WHICH YOU SUBMERGE UP TO THE NECK YOU HAVE A HEA LWS OF ELEVEN PER CENT FROM THE BODY FOR AND WHEN YOU THEN A ALSO DUNK THE HEAD YOU WOULD INCREASE THAT HEAT LOWS RATE BY THIRTY SIX PER CENT SO THAT MED I'M NOT SAYING THAT I'M NOT I'M NOT HERE TO SAY WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS WRONG I JUST THINK THAT PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW THE INFORMATION SO THEY CAN FOR THEMSELF EVALUATE WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM BUT IF YOU INCREASE YOUR HEAT LOS RATE BY THIRTY SIX PER CENT FROM YOUR CORE THATSCONNE INCREASE YOUR AFTER DROP WHICH WE JUDGE UPON LIBEOLIA EVEN FURTHER SO THAT MEANING THAT YOU ARE CLOSER TO HIGH PUFTHERMIA THAN YOU ARE IF YOU JUST SUBMERGE UP TO THE NECK SO YOU SHOULD REALLY THINK ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS LIKE SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO DO OR IF IT'S JUST BETTER FOR YOU NOT TO GET THAT COLD IN YOUR CORE THE BEANY IS ALSO BECAUSE I HAVE A LITBET A SENSITIVE EARS SO IT MEANING THAT IF THERE'S WIND AND BECAUSE WE WOM IN THE OPEN SEA AND DENMARK WE HAVE A LOT OF WIND OUR WIN OUR CONDITIONS ARE JUST VERY RAINY VERY WINDY AND WHEN THE TEMPERATURE IS ALSO FREEZING YOU COULD GET THIS IN WHAT IS THAT COD IN SO VERY COLD AND LIGHT HEADED JUST FROM WIND SO IF YOU ALSO SUBMERGCHIN TO COL WAR ON YOU THEN GET UP YOU CYOU WOULD GET A BRAIN PHRASE IMMEDIATELY SO IT IS ENOUGH TO JUST GO UP TO THE NECK WERABINNEAC SHOU JUST NOT GET THISSY ALSO BECAUSE THE THE I THE HEAT LOWS IS INCREASED OF COURSE BUT IT ALSO THE BLUFFFLOAT TO THE BRAIN HAS DECREASED SO THE BENNY WOULD KEEP YOU A LITTLE BIT WARMER SO YOU CAN STAY FOR ONE O TWO MINUTE SO IT'S JUST A WAY OF LIKE G TTING AROUND SOME OF THE CONDITIONS ALSO SO PEOPLE CAN CHOOSE THAT IF THEY THEY FEEL TAT BOUT IT'S QUITE QUITE NOBLE IITS TO DO IN INSCANDINAVIA WERA BINI OF IT AND UM SO FOR THOSE OF YOU AFRAID OF DOING TWO MINUTE COLD SHOWER WHENT A DOCTOR SILVER JUST A DESCRIBED A LET'S A YOU SEE HOW UM SHE AND OTHERS ARE CAPABLE OF DOING THINGS FAR HARDER THAN THAT UM WHEN IN THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE IT WITH THE COLD WIND AND SCANDINAVIA AND A UM IS IS QUITE STRIKING IT ALONG THE LINES OF COVERING THE HEAD UM THERE'S THIS UM SEEMINGLY PARADOXICAL A THING OF PEOPLE GOING INTO HOT SANAS AND WEARING WOOL CAPS IF YOU GO TO ABANA OR YOU I GO TO ASANA AND THEREARE PEOPLE WHO ARE UAM WELL FROM EASTERN EUROPE AR DIPICALLY AR FINLIND OR AM RUSSIA YOU CRANE OR ELSEWHERE WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS THAT MANY OF THEM ARE WEARING WOOL CAPS IN THE SANA WHICH MANY PEOPLE THINK IT'S TO MAKE IT HOTTER THAT'S I SHALLY NOT THE CASE IT ACTUALLY INSULATES YOU FROM THE HEAT ENVIRONMENT THE URGE THE SENSE OF URGENCY TO GET OUT OF THE HOT SAN IS A BRAIN DRIVEN MECHANISM AND SO UM THE REASON THAT PEOPLE WEAR WOOL HATS IN THE SANA IS IT ACTUALLY LETS YOU STAY IN THE SANA LONGER M BECAUSE TAKES A LOT OF HEAT TO THE SKIN BEFORE YOU FEEL THAT YOU  HALF QUOTIC HALF TO GET OUT WEREAS SO WHEN YOU INSULATE THE BRAIN U YOU DON'T GET THAT SIGNAL UM IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING IAVE TRIED THIS BEFORE JUST BY PUTING A TOWEL OVER MY HEAD IN THE SANA AND YOU CAN STAY IN THERE UMUCH MORE EASILY AND FOR FOR MUCH LONGER YOU AS WE TALK ABOUT THESE DIFFERENT STIMULE FOR A THE HORMETIC RESPONSE THE ADAPTATION DISTRESS  IT OCCURS TO ME THAT THTHE BIG ONES IN OUR EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY HAVE BEEN LIGHT RIGHT I MEAN YOUARE TIING MOUT SEASONAL CHANGES UM WE KNOW THERE ESPECIALLY AS YOU GO UP TO NORDIC COUNTRIES THERE SEASONAL CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT BY TIME OF YEAR DRAMATIC ONES IN FACT A AS I'M LESS SO AT THERATER OF COURSE U LIGHT TEMPERATURE FOOD MOVEMENT AND IT'S SORT OF INTERESTING AND AND AT THE SAME TIME PERHAPS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS TO US THAT THERE ARE STIMULEE THAT OUR BOBDIES HAVE EVOLVE TO ADAPT TO IN VERY POWERFUL WAYS AND SO THE IDEA THAT TEMPERATURE HEAT AND COLD COULD EVOKE THESE TREMENDOUS PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES THAT ARE BENEFICIAL FOR US PROBABLY SHOULDN'T SURPRISE  NOT ALL I MIN EMMIN THIS IS WII MEAN THAT THESE ARE NOT UESSO ESOTERIC MECHANISMS THEY'RE ACTUALLY THAT THE FOUNDATIONAL MECHANISMS BY WHICH ARE OUR BODY AND BODIES OF OTHER ANIMALS ADAPT UM SO I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE A DIFFERENT WAYS THAT PEOPLE COULD APPROACH DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE SO FOR INSTANCE UM CHILDREN I'VE BEEN TO BONYAS WHERE THE'RE KIDS OUKNOW SIX OR SEVEN YEARS OLD WITH THEIR PARENTS AT THE BONIA U AND SO THEY'RE IN HOT SONA I'M NOT SUGGESTING PEOPLE DO THIS IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE NOT YOU KNOW ADAPTED TO IT ANYO DOCT YOUR PARENTS KIDS AND TAUGHT YOUR KIDS PARENCE IM TOUCT YOUR DOCTOR  BUT IS REMARKABLE I MEAN A CHILDREN DOING SANA FROM A YOUNG AGE OR DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE ARE THERE ANY DATE ON THIS AND IS IT SAFE ASSUMING THAT YOU KNO OBVIOUSLY THE THEY CAN SWIM IN OR THEY'RE DOING THIS INIT IN A TUB OR SHOWER U AND THEN I'D ALSO LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL MALE FEMALE DIFFERENCES I KNOW YOUR STUDY FOCUSSTIMATE AM ON MEN BUT UM OTHER STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON BOTH AND YOU OF COURSE UM ARE WOMEN AND CAN ATTEST TO YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE WITH THIS UM SO CHILDREN MEN WOMENUM DIFFERENCES THERE I'M IN TERMS OF PROTOCALS IS HERE ANYTHING THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BUILD INTO THE STRUCTURE OF THEIR DELIERATE COLD EXPOSURE THAT'S UNIQUE TO THAPT I SO YES O DIS AS AN UNCOTE EXPOSURE SO AM YE I THINK THAT EM STINING WITH THE THE QUESTION ABOUT CHILDREN U I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT TO TO THINK ABOUT A AS HILDREN ARE SMALLER THAN AT ALL SO WE CANNOT REALLY COMPLETELY TRANSFER ALL THE INFORMATION AND THE BENEFITS AND ALSO PROTOCOS FOR HOW LONG AND AND AND STOP LIKE THA TWO CHILDREN WE CANNOT DO THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE JUST SMALLER IN MASS AND ONE STUDY THAT ACTUALLY IN APPROVE THIS IS A STUDY WHERE THEY HAVE A COMPARED THE HEAT LOST A IN  CHILDREN THE BOYS WHO WERE TWELVE YEARS OLD E COMPARED TO A ADLS IN MEN AND LOOKED AT H HEAT LOST OF THE COUR TEMPERATURE AND EXPOSED THEM TO A A ONE OR ONE OR TWO MINUTES A COLD EXPOSE TO SAW EMOTION UP TO THE NECK AND WHAT THEY SAW WAS THAT THE THE THE BOYS IN THIS STUDY COULD ACTUALLY DEFEND THEIR COURT TEMPERATURE IN IS SAME WAY AS THE ADLES COULD BUT THEY HAD TO USE THEIR MUSCLES WAY FAST SO IT MEANS THAT THEY COULDN'T STAY FOR AS LONG AY AND THEY USED MORE ENERGY TO DEFEND THEIR COURT TEMPERATURE COMPATUALLY TO THE DLES BUT FOR ONE MINUTE IT SEEMS THAT THEY COULD ACTUALLY COM BUT THEY WOULD BE COLDER WHEN THEY THEN COME OUT BECAUSE THEY ARE SMALLER IN THEI MASS TO THEIR RATIO RIGHT SO IT MEANS THAT IF THE SURFACE IS SO LARGE ON CHILDREN AND THEIR MASS AND MUSCLES BEING SMALLER TO THAT RATU IT MEANS THAT THEY CAN BE IN THE WATER LESS TIME BEFORE THEY GET HYGH POTHERMIC SO JUST THINK ABOUT THAT THEY ARE JUST SMALLER THEY CAN'T DEFEND THEIR TEMPERATURE FOR A VERY LONG TIME BUT IN THIS STUDY THE SOW THAT FORUP TO I THINK IT IT WAS A MINUTE OR SO THEY CAN ONE MILIAN GOD YYU MENTION I PREFERMI AND SMALL BODIED UM PEOPLE CHILDREN A IS TODUE SOM ON PACIFIC  OCEAN SWIMS IN THE MORNING OM WITHOUT WAT SUITS AND I ADAPTED TO IT PRETTY QUICKLY AND THES FAIRLY LONG SWIMS HEN WE BROUGHT AN EXCELLENT SWIMMER WITH US UM U THAT WAS IN TURNING WITH ME FOR A WHILE UM E'S SIXTEEN YEARS OLD AT THE TIME AND  VERY LEAN AND UM HE WASN'T SMALL FOR HIS AGE BUT HE WAS SMALLER THAN US ATINLEA THE WAS ALL KEYES ON THE SWIM THAT DAY I'M SOMETIMES WOMEN JOIN US U AND HE GOT HYPOTHERMIC U AND HE'S EXCELLENT SWIMMER AND HE DIDN'T REPORT FEELING OVERLY COLD BUT UM FORTUNATELY WE GOT HIM TO SHORE AND HEATED HIM UP AGAIN UM SO HE LIVED I DON'T THINK HIS MOTHERS CAN EVER LET HIM GO SWIMMING WITH US AN HES THRIVING IN THE WORLD HE'S A UNIVERSITES TO NOW UM AND HE RECALLS THAT SWIM I M THIS WHY YOU ALWAYS WANTE OCEAN SWIM WITH ABODY WITH EVIL UM YET HE HE BECAME HYPOTHERMIC HIS TEETH TURNED YELLOW HE WAS GOT SLURRING IS WORDS HE WASN'T MAKING SAN HE KNO WE GOT HIM ON TO SHORE AND HE WAS AN YOU KNOW JEELLING IN A LLE ESEMI OUFORA HAAAD YOU KNOW WAS IT U HYPA THERME IS NO JOKE SO I THINK IM Y YES I I AM REALLY GLAD THAT THIS IS COMING UP BECAUSE THE COLD IS A POWERFUL STIMULUS AND UM NIGT AND KIDS ARE AT A AND SMALLER BODIED PEOPLE ARE A GREATER RISK OF HYPOTHERMIA SO A GOOD REASON TO APPROACH IT WITH CAUTION MAYBE THERE'S OUR RECALL SHOWERS YET I THEN COLD IMMERSION AN STILL WATER NATURAL WATER AND OPEN BODIES WATER OF COURSE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE UM MORE DANGEROUS FOR OTHER REASONS CURRENTS AN THASK THAT LIKE OK NFONIN YE SO IMPORTANT NOTE THERE UM WHAT ABOUT ANY ADDITIONAL MALE FEMALE DIFFERENCES OR SIMILARITIES THAT UM WE SHOULD BEWARE OF AND THIS COMES UP ALL THE TIME ON SOCIA MEDIA ANY TIME I POST ANYTHING ABOUT A STUDY  IT'S WHAT ABOUT WOMEN BECAUSE OFTENTIMES THERE ARE DIFFERENCES OH YE AN AN AN THI WE WE ALSO JUST TALKED ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE IN IN IN IN TEMPERATURE IN MEN AND WOMEN SO IT MEANS THAT IF WE DID WEF WE RAPLICATED MY STUDY IN WOMEN IT COULD BE THAT THEY WOULD THEY HAVE ENOUGH YOU CAN SAY COLD EXPOSIUR WITH JUST NINE MINUTES PER WEEK IT COULD BE BECAUSE THEY APPARENTLY A OUSO JUST COLDER AND  AND THEY HAVE AINCREASE MENTABILISMEN THA BROWNFED IS JUST TO HAVE MORE BROWN FAT IT COULD BE BUT THIS IS JUST SOMETHING THAT I I I I FRANKLY DON'T KNOW BUT WOMEN AL SO DO  COLT EXPOSURE WINTER SWIMMING WITH THE ELEVEN MINUTES PROTOCO I DO IT IT MYSELF AND FEEL A GOOD ABOUT IT SO I WOULD SAY THAT AN WOMEN A ALSO REGARDING EXHIBATION OF THE BROWN FET IT SHOULD BE THE SAME AN IN THEORY BUT I DON'T KNOW IF WOMEN ECTUALLY DO NEED TO HAVE ANOTHER PROTOCO WHEN IT COMES TO THIS RAPID COT EXPOSURE I THINK THAT IT'S ANOTHER QUESTION IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ICE SWIMMING WHEN IT COMES TO HOW FAR CAN YOU BE IN THE COL WATER WITHOUT GETTING HYPOTHEMIC THEN THAT WILL WE DIFFERENCE AS  IN MENEN AND AN FEMALE BEEN BUT IF YOU DO THIS COLT EXPOSURE FOR VERY BRIEF AMOUNT OF TIME WHICH IS WHAT I TRY TO TO TALK TO B TALK ABOUT IT WHAT WE CALL OL SOME MICROSTRESSING THE BUDY TO TO INCREASED TE HOMETIC STRESS TO HEALTHY STRESS THEN THIS IS SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT OF AN IT'S EXPOSURE THAT IT IT'S FALLY THE SAME I THINK I THINK WOMEN CAN LOOK AT THIS AS A FALLY A GOOD PROTICOL FOR THE FOR FOR THEM AS WELL I ALWAYS SAY THAT IF YOU REALLY DREAD THE COLD AND AM DON'T LIKE THE COLD THAN YOU ARE A PERFECT CANDIDATE FOR USING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE BECAUSE THE SYMPATHETIC A GAY THE STRESS RESPONSE WILL BE GREATER AND THEREBY THE ADAPTATION TO THAT SHORTER ONE OR TWO MINUTES IS A IS GOING TO BE MUCH GREATER RITHE FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE IN THE COLD IT'S HARDER TO GET AT AADAPTATION RESPONSE THE SAME WAY THAT IF SOMEBODY IS VERY STRONG AND THEY CAN LIFT A VERY HEAVY WEIGHT THAT HAT VERY HEAVY WEIGHT IS UNLIKELY TO EVOKE THE SAME KIND OF IR SEEM DEGREE OF THAT OF A ADAPT IVE RESPONSES IF SOMEBODY IS NOT QUITE AS STRONG SO ANOTHER REASON TO KEEP THESE EXPOSURES RELATIVELY SHORT AND MORE FREQUENT THAN TO DO LONGER DURATIO N EXPOSURES FREQUENTLY HOWEVER LET'S SAY SOMEBODY ONLY HAD TWO DAYS A WEEK OM TO DO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE MAYBE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO USSONA MAYBE THEY DO WOULD YOU SUGGEST THAT THEY GET IN FOR ONE OR TWO MINUTES THEN GET OUT THEN GET BACK IN FOR ANOTHER COUPLE OF MINUTES THEN GET OUT AND CALL THAT FOR E KNOW FOUR OR FIVE MINUTES OM TO TRY AND GET TO THAT ELEVEN MINUTES TOTAL PER WEEK OM AS A PUSSTY GETTING IN FOR A FULL FIVE MINUTES IM AND THEN GETTING OUT AND COMING BACK A SECOND TIME THAT WEEK I KNOW THIS IS GETTING DOWN INTO THE WEEDS BUT THESE ARE THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT I THINK PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO KNOW BECAUSE NO A LOT OF PEOPLE EITHER DON'T LIVE CLOSE TO A BODY OF WATER OR DON'T HAVE A COLD PLUNGE OM THAT THEY CAN DO THIS WITH ALTHOUGH COL SHOWER APPARENTLY WORKS TO SO ALMOST PEOPLE LIVE CLOSE TO A SHOWER YES THE DEFINITELY I THINK THT THE CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE IS WHAT IS  STRANGETHEING YOUR YOU SET M YOUR CELLS IN THE BODY SO IF YOU CAN DO THE SHORT AMOUNT OF A EXPOSURE AND THEN GET OUT AND GET BACK IN THAT IS GONEYOU CAN SAY IM IM STRANGTHEN YOURSELVES BECAUSE YOU ARE CHALLINGING THEM TO TO ADAPT TO IM CHANGING TEMPTEMPERATURES SO DURING ONE SESSION YOU CAN CHANGE THIS RIDY YOU CAN DO IT IF YOU ARE ABLE TO GO TO COL WATER BUT ALSO A SONA THEN YOU JUST DO THAT AUTOMATICALLY YOU WOILL HAVE A CHANGE IN TEMPERATURE BUT YOU COULD ALSO DO IT WHAT VARIATING THE TEMPERATURE AND YOUR COL PLUNGE IF YOU HAVE IF YOU HAVE A PLUNCHOY IF YOU HAVE TH OPEN SEA YE YOU HAVE SEASONING  SEASONS EVEN YOU HAVE WE HAVE TEN BEEN MARK SO WE HAVE FOUR SEASONS AND THE TEMPERATURE IS GONE TO VARY WITH THAT SOUH WE HAVE NATURE WHO CAN JUST CHANGE THIS FARSE AND WE DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IF YOU HAVE A COL PLUNGE WELL THEN I WOULD SAY THAT CHANGING THE TEMPERATURE IS WHAT IS GONE A CREATE THIS HOMETIC STRESS AND ALSO KEEP YOUR SELLS ON ITS TOS YOU CAN SAY BECAUSE YOU ARE TRI THE BODY WILL STILL BE IM STRESSE TO TRY TO ADAPT TO THE NEW TE M BUTYER AS THEY'D SEEN US SOMETHING EXUALLY TOXSIC TO THE BODY RID IS A SMALL SMALL PIECE OF SUCIDITY THAT YOU ARE EXPOSING YOURSELF TO YOU DON'T HAVE TO SWALLOW IT BUT IT'S ENOUGH THAT YOU TUNCED IT NEXILY A THE GREAT A GREAT WAY TO FRAME IT AM THAT BRINGS ME BACK TO THES IDEAF CIRCADIAN TIME Y IN YOUR STUDY YOU DIDN'T UM CONTROL FERS THE SPECIFIC TIME OF DAY AND NOW I'M REALIZING THAT MAY BE A GREAT ASSET TO THE WHOLE THING SO WE KNOW FOR INSTANCE THAT OUR BODIES GO THROUGH PRETTY DRAMATIC SHIFTS IN TEMPERATURE FROM THE TIME WE WAKE UP I MY BODY STARTS HEATING UP AS WE WAKE UP AND I'M CONTINUES TO HEAT UNTIL THE AFTERNOON AND THET SARCE O DROP IN THE LATER AFTERNOON AND THEN ASSUMING ALL THINGS ARE WORKING CORRECTLY IM THAT BODY TOMPERATURE DROPS WHAN WE SLEEP SO I COULD IMAGINE THAT DOING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AT DIFFERENT TIMES IM JUST BY WAY OF CONVENIENCE OR BY WAY OF INTENTION COULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL BECAUSE MY BODY TEMPERATURE IS GOING TO BE QUITE A BIT WARMER AT ONE TIME OF DAY VERSES ANOTHER AND IN THAT WAY KEEPING THE ISTEM TUNED AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I KEEP HEARING COMING THROUGH IN AS YOU EXPLAIN THESE DATA AND ALL THESE A BEAUTIFUL STUDIES YOURS AND OTHERS IS THAT IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT GETTING COLD IT'S ABOUT GOING FROM WARM TO COLD AND FROM COLD TO WARM IT'S NOT IT AND I LOVE THIS IDEA BECAUSE I PRI SAID THIS A HUNDRED TIMES ON MY PODCASTS IN A MILLION TIMES IN MY LIFE AND I'LL CONTINUE TO WHICH IS THAT BIOLOGY IS NOT IN EVENT IT'S A PROCESS LIKE THESE THESE A METABALL LIKE CAN THERM O REGULATORY PROCESSIES ARE INDEED LIKE THE TURNING OF A KNOB IT'S OF VERB YET IT'S IT AS SUPPOSED TO ANOWN AND I AND SO I I THINK IF PEOPLE CAN INTERNALIZE THAT IDEA THAT THEY'RE GOING TO A HAVE A LOT MORE FLEXIBILITY A LOT MORE FUN AN AND GET A LOT MORE BENEFIT AS SUPPOSE TO THINKING O CAY I NEED TO GET INTO EX DEGREES OF WATER FOR EX AMOUNT OF TIME ON EX NUMBER OF DAYS YET YOU KNOW IN A VERENTII IS WAY ALL THE TIME ON HOW MUCH AND HOW COLD AND AND I MEAN IT'S NOT IT'S JUST LIKE WELL BECAUSE E ALSO DON'T HAVE STUDIES SOWING EXACTLY IF YOU JUST KEEP FIVE DEGREES IN YOUR WATER AND YOU DO THAT FOR MONTH THAN WHAT HAPPENS WE MAYBE THE FUTURE WE'LL KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT THIS AND I'M I'M SURE IT'S GOING TO COME AND I REALLY HOPE SO BUT I JUST THINK BY LOGICALLY CHANGING THAT TEMPERATURE UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN AND YOU ALSO DO THAT IN YOUR WATER IT DOESN'T REALLY IS NOT THAT IMPORTANT WHAT TEMPERATURE YOU YOUILL HAVE YOUR WATER THAN THAN JUST KEEP CHANGING IT GOING UP AND DOWN IT YOU BE ALL UP TO TWELVE DEGREES SELSURES YOU'R GONG TO EXIVATE YOUR BROUNFET ANYWAYS I MEAN TWELVE AT NINETEEN DEGREES COLD AIR IS ENOUGH TO ECTIBATE YOUR BROUNTH IS SO MAYBE WE DON'T HAVE TO GO AS COLD AS I THINK MANY PEOPLE THINK AND AND PUTTING ICE EVEN ALL THE TIME YOU DON'T HAVE TO IT'S NOT I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO TO EXPOSE YOURSELF TO THAT COLD IT TEMPERATURE ALL THE TIME AN BUT VERYAT O BIT SO KEEP THE SYSTEM OFF BALANCE AND YOU ALL THE MARE GEVE IT TUND YE YOU MENTION AT I STUDY THAT IS MORE RECENT AN ON GOING THAT'S NOT PUBLISHED ER M IF YOU'RE WILING I'M COULD YOU SHARE MAYBE SOME OF THE A DATA FROM THAT OR FINDINGS FROM THAT STUDY M WITH OF COURSE THE THE CUE TO EVERYBODY THAT THESE ARE NOT YET PUBLISHED DATA SO THAT THE CONCLUSIONS COULD CHANGE THE DATE I COULD CHANGE FOR THAT MATTER YES SO WE WE HAVEN'T ANALYZED ALL THE DEBTA YET AND I I KNOW FROM THE STUDYD THAT WE DID PUBLISH THAT WE WE WOULD NEED TO LOOK MORE AT THE THAT A SO I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY RESAULTS YET THAT I CAN SHARE BECAUSE WE ARE STILL IN VERY PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THIS SO I'VE I WOULDN'T KNOW YET WHAT TO EXACTLY SAY ABOUT IT BUT WHAL WE LOOK THAT WAS BOTH MEN AND WOMEN LEF THEM SO THAT'S THAT'S COMMING OH THATS FANTASTIC AT AND THAT ANSWERS GOING TO PLEASE A GREAT E NUMBERK PEOPLE  AND AN ENTRIGUE EVERYBODY SO WELL SONI I WANT YOU REALLY THANK YOU FOR COMING HERE TO DAY TO TALK ABOUT YOUR WORK IM AN ND THE INCREDIBLE DIRECTION THAT IT POINTS TO BECAUSE I THINK THAT AM YOU KNOW NO ONE STUDY IS DEFINITIVE BUT YOUR STUDY REALLY AGAIN STANDS AS A LANDMARK IN THE A LANDSCAPE OF EXPLORING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND HEAT HOW IT CAN IMPACT AND POTENTIALLY IMPACT OUR HEALTH BECAUSE FRANKLY THERE JUST HAVENT BEEN THAT MANY A HIGH RESOLUTION  DETAILED MODERN STUDIES OF THIS THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES OF SAWNA THERE BEEN SOME STUDIES OF COLD THERE A LOT OF GROUPS IN PHYSIOLOGY THAT WORK ON A HYPOTHERMIA AND VERY COLD EXPOSURE BUT AM MOST OF THE TEMPERATURES USED IN THOSE SDADIES JUST AREN'T PRACTICAL SO FIRST ALL I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR DOING THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE AND FOR THE WORK THAT YOU CONTINUE TO DO I'M A A WAITING WITH BAITED BREATH AS THEY SAY TO A A TO HEAR THE RESULTS OF THIS A STUDY THAT'S ON GOING ON BOTH MEN AND WOMEN SO A LL AVE TO HAVE YOU BACK TO ORM US ABOUT THAT SOON AND I WANT A THANK YOU FOR A THE INCREDIBLE PUBLIC EDUCATION EFFORTS THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING ON SOCIAL MEDIA AM AND IN WITH RESPECT TO YOUR BOOK AM AND WE OF COURSE WE'LL PUT LINKT ALL THOSE THINGS IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS SO PEOPLE CAN LEARN FROM YOU AND CAN CONTINUE TO LEARN FROM YOU WE WE CERTAINLY NEED MORE SCIENTISTS WHO ARE BOTH EXPERIENCE WITH DOING HARD CORE RESEARCH AS IT'S CALLED AND WHO ALSO DO THE PRACTICES I THINK TAT' AWONDERFUL ADDITIONAL ASTSET YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT JUST BEHIND A LAP COTE OR BUNDLED UP IN A IN A DOWN A IN A DOWN FEATHERD JACKET AS EVERYONE ELSE IS GETTING INTO COLD YOU DO THESE THINGS AND THAT YOU ARE SO OPEN AND GENEROUS IN THE WAY THAT YOU SHARE A KNOWLEDGE WHICH INCLUDES COMING HERE TO DAY TO TO SHARE KNOWLEDGE WITH ME AND OUR AUDIENCE A THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH YO VERY WELLCOME I AM SO PLEASE TO BE AND THANK YOU SOM MI PLAIN BIDING ME AND I CALD EXPLAIN MY STUDY AND I CAN SHARE THEM OP MY INSIDES FOM FROM DOING THAT SO I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR BEING HERE DELIGHTED AND WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE YOU BACK AGAIN

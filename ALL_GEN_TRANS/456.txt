WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LALCONEN DISCUS SCIENCE SCIENCE SPACE TO  I MANDRUHUBERMAN AND ON A PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND ALTHOMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE DISCUSSING ALCOHOL ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY CONSUME SUBSTANCES ON THE PLANET EARTH SHOULD MENTION THAT BOTH HUMANS AND NON HUMAN ANIMALS CONSUME ALCOHOL EITHER FOR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES BECAUSE THEY LIKE THE FEELING THAT IT GIVES THEM OR FOR MADITIONAL PURPOSES OR FOR OTHER PURPOSES THAT WILL DISCUSS WE ARE OF COURSE GOING TO DISCUSS THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON OUR BIOLOGY RANGING FROM ITS EFFECTS ON INDIVIDUAL CELLS ON ORGANS AND ORGAN SYSTEMS IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY WE ARE ALSO GOING TO DISCUSS THE EFFECTS OF THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL THAT IS WHAT BEING INEBRIATED REALLY DOES TO OUR THINKING IN OUR BEHAVIOUR IN HOW IT DOES IT AND WE ARE GOING TO ADDRESS WHAT SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THE MORE COMMON QUESTIONS OUT THERE WHICH IS WHETHER OR NOT LOW TO MODERATE AMOUNTS OF DRINKING ARE BETTER FOR OUR HEALTH THAN ZERO ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AT ALL AND OF COURSE WE WILL TAL ABOUT SEVERE ALCOHOL IN TAKE BINGE DRINKING WE WIL ALL SOTOCK BOT HANG OVER AND WHAT SCIENCE SAYS OF UT WAYS TO REDUCE THE EFFECTS OF HANG OVER EITHER BY DOING THINGS THAT ARE INOCULATORY MEANING BEFORE YOU DRINK OR WHILE YOU DRINK AS WELL AS THINGS TO DOU IF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE A HANG OVER WE WILL DISCUSS SOME OF THE GENETIC DIFFERENCES FOR ALCOHOL AND ALCHOLISM AND WE WILL DISCUSS ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION IN YOUNG PEOPLE AND HOW THAT CAN BE ESPECIALLY DETRIMENTAL FOR REASONS THAT I THINK ARE GONG TO BE QUITE SURPRISING TO MOST OF YOU MY GOL IS THAT BY THE END OF TO DAY'S EPISODE YOU WILL HAVE A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT ALCOHOL DOES TO YOUR BRAIN ANBODY AND THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE INFORM DECISIONS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU SHOULD BE CONSUMING ZERO ABSOLUTELY NO ALCOHOL SMALL TO MODERATE AMOUNTS OF ALCHL AGAIN WILL DEFINE EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS SMALL TO MODERATE AMOUNTS AND IF YOU OR SOMEBODY ELSE THAT YOU KNOW IS CONSUMING EXCESSIVE OF ANTS OF ALCOHOL THAT ARE CLEARLY DETRIMENTAL TO YOR HEALTH SOME OF THE BETTER ROUTES AND RESOURCES THAT YOU CAN USE IN ORDER TO REMOVE THAT DEPENDENCE AND OR CONSUMPTION I LIKE TO PREFACE ALL OF THAT BY SAYING THAT TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS REALLY GEARED TOWARD GIVING YOU INFORMATION IT IS NOT ABOUT JUDGING ALCOHOL INTAKE OR ALCOB ALCOHOLIN TAKE I JUST WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE MOST INFORM DECISION ABAUT ALCOHOL POSSIBLE BEFORE WE GET INTO DAY'S CONTENT IN DETAIL I JUST WANT TO ANSWER A COMMONLY ASK QUESTION OF AT ALCHOL CONSUMPTION AND THE BRAIN AND THE QUESTION THAT SO OFTEN COMES UP IS WHETHER OR NOT LOW TO MODERATE AMOUNTS OF ALCOHOL MAY BE ONE DRINK A DAY OR ONE OR TWO DRINKS TO DAY KIND OF THING WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS BAD FOR YOUR BRAIN IN PARTICULAR WHETHER NOT IT CAUSES DEGENERATION OF NURONS OR NERVE CELLS NOW THE REASON THAT QUESSION COMES UP SO OFTEN IS BECAUSE FOR MANY YEARS IT'S BEEN KNOWN THAT HIGH LEVELS OF ALCHOL CONSUMPTION SO TWELVE TO TWENTY FOR DRINKS PER WEEK OR MORE IS CERTAINLY CAUSING NER OR DEGENERATION IN PARTICULAR OF THE SO CALE NEO QUARTECS THE OUTER LAYERS OF THE BRAIN THAT HOWS ASSOCIATIVE MEMORIES THAT HOWS OUR ABILITY TO THINK IN PLAN THAT HOWS OUR ABILITY TO REGULATE OUR MORE PRIMITIVE DRIVES ACCORDING TO CONTACT ET CETERA SO TO MAKE VERY CLEAR DRINKING A LOT SO HAVING YOU KNOW THREE OR FOUR DRINKS PER NIGHT EVERY NIGHT OF THE WEEK IS CLEARLY BAD FOR THE BRAIN A RECENT STUDY HOWEVER FINALLY ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF WHEATHER NOT LOW TO MODERATE AMOUNTS OF ALCOL CONSUMPTION CAN CAUSE BRAIN DEGENERATION THE TITLE OF THE STUDY IS AS SOCIATIONS BETWEN ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND GRAY AND WHITE MITER VOLUMES IN THE UC BIOBANK THE UNITE KINGDOM IOBAK FORSO A GRAY MATTER ARE THE NURONS IS THE SO CALLED SELL BODIES THAT WIT HOWS THE GENOMAN THE CELLS AT CETERA AND WHITE MATTER IS THE CONNECTIONS THE FIBRS THE SO CALLED AXONS OF NURONS AND IT IT'S CALLED WHITE MATTER BECAUSE THAT A THAT TISSUE IS SURROUNDED BY A FATTY TISSUE CALL MILAN WHICH ALLOWS NERVE SELLS TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER VERY QUICKLY SO WHAT THIS STUDY DID IS IT LOOKED AT THE BRAINS BOTH THE GRAY MATTER AND THE WHITE MATTER OF MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND ANY MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND GENERALLY HEALTHY MIDDLE AGED AND OLDER ADULTS IN THE UNITE KINGDOM WHO WERE DRINKING VERIOUS AMOUNTS OF ALCOHOL WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT EVEN FOR PEOPLE THAT WERE DRINKING LOW TO MODERATE AMOUNTS OF ALCOHOL SO ONE OR TWO DRINKS PER DAY THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF THINNING OF THE NEO QUARTEX SO LOSS OF NURONS AND NEOQUARTECS AND OTHER BRAIN REGIONS AND I DON'T SAY THIS IN ORDER TO CAUSE ALARM I TELL YOU THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPORTANT DATA BECAUSE THEY REVEAL AND INDEED ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT HAS BEEN BURNING FOR SO LONG ASWEATHER OR NOT CHRONIC ALCOHOL IN TAKE CAN DISTRUPT THE BRAIN EVEN IF THE CHRONIC IN TAKE IS VERY LOW NOW WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT WHAT THE WORD CHRONIC MEANS BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE WHEN THEY HEAR THE WORD CHRONIC THINK HIGH LEVELS OF WHATEVER IN TAKE OKID SO THEY THINK FIVE DRINKS O NIHT OR TEN DRINKS TO NIGHT OR PEOPLE DRINKING EVERY NIGHT NOW IN THE STUDY THEY LOOKED AT PEOPLE WHO ON AVERAGE WERE DRINKING ONE OR TWO DRINKS PER NIGHT SO THAT COULD BE FOURTEEN DRINKS ON THE WEAKEND IT COULD BE ONE DRINK PER NIGHT IT COULD BE SEVEN DRINKS ON FRIDAY IN OTHER WORDS ON AVERAGE ONE OR TWO DRINKS PER NIGHT AND I THINK MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE DRINKING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE AN TWO DRINKS PER NIGHT OR DAY OF THE WEK ON AVERAGE TO THAT WOULD BE SEVEN TO FOURTEEN DRINKS PER WEEK SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STUDY BECAUSE IT SAYS THAT IF YOU'RE CONSUMING YOU VEN JUST SEVEN GLASSES OF WINE ACROSS THE WEEK IT'S LIKELY THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME DEGENERATION OF YOUR BRAIN IN RESPONSE TO THAT ALCOHOL IN TAKE ALTHOUGH AS MENTION EARLIER WE WILL TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CAN INOCULATE AGAINST SOME OF THAT NAURONAL LOSS FOR THOSE OF YOU THEIAR INTERESTED IN READING THE STUDY IN MORE DETAIL WE PUT A LINK TO IT IN THE SH OW NOTE CAPTIONS BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHAS S THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROR MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS IT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRON EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTOC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SINS RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S POTCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR NOW SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLITES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLITE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHOSITS IN COGNITIVE END PHYSICAL PERFORMANCTE ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACK TO ELECTROLIKE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT'S ONE GRAHAM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDRE MILEGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF IAVE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOUD LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT DOC COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT EL EMENT DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN LET'S TALK ABOUT ALCOHOL UNLESS US ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HUMAN BEINGS OF BEEN CONSUMING ALCHOL FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS IF YOU LOOK AT THE ARCHEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE FOR MESEPOTAMIA YOU'LL FIND THAT FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO PEOPLEL HAD WINE VESSELS AR FEW WANT TO KNOW WHEN PEOPLE FIRST STARTED DISTILLING ALCHOL MUCH HOF PEOPLE SURPRISE THAT DID NOT FOR TAKE PLACE IN IRELENT AND THAT'S NOT A JOKE ABOUT THE IRISH THAT YOU'LL SEOLOTIC CLAIMS ON LINE THAT THE IRISH WERE THE FIRST TO DISTILL ALCHOL BUT IN FACT THEY WERE NOT IT WAS THE CHINESE THAT WERE THE FIRST TO DISTILL ALCHOLN THAT TOOK PLACE IN CHINA IN THE FIRST CENTURY ALCHOLL HAS BEEN USED FOR NUTRITIONAL PURPOSES SO THERE ARE CULTURES THAT BELIEVIN INDEED STILL BELIEVE THAT THE CALORIES IN ALCOHL ARE USEFUL OF THE LATER WILL TALK ABOUT HOW ALCHOLCALORIES ARE INDEED EMPTY CALORIES AND WHAT AN EMPTY CALORY REALLY IS WHY IT'S CALLED EMPTY ALCOL HAS BEEN USED FOR MEDICINAL PURPOSES BECAUSE INDEED IT DOES KILL BACTERIA AND AS YOU'LL SOON FIND OUT THE FACT THAT IT KILLS BACTERIA BECAUSE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE IT ALSO KILLS THE GOOD BACTERIAN YOUR GUT AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT GOOD BACTERIAN YOUR GUT CAN LEAD TO THINGS LIKE LEEKY GUT SYNDRUM AND HAS ALL SORTS OF ISSUES AND THEIR WAYS TO DEAL WITH THOSE ISSUES ND WI'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE TO ALCOHOL HAS BEEN USED FOR MEDICINAL PURPOSES IT'S BEEN USED TO CLEAN SURFACES IT'S USED IN MY LABORATORY IN ORDER TO MAKE UP SO CALLED REAGENTS TO DO OUR EXPERIMENTS BUT MOST HUMANS HAVE BEEN CONSUMING ALCOHOL IN ORDER TO CHANGE THEIR INTERNAL STATE IN ORDER TO FEEL DIFFERENTLY THAN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE THAT FEELING OF BEING DRUNK OR INEBRIATED OR TIPSY OR LIGHT HEADED IS SOMETHING THAT MANY NOT ALL BUT MANY HUMAN SEEM TO ENJOY AND PURSUE EVEN THOUGH TYPICALLY IT LEADS TO A FEELING OF BEING LESS HAPPY LESS S MOTIVATED MORE STRESSED ET CETERA WHEN THE ALCHOL WEARES OFF THAT'S PRETTY INCREDIBLE RIHTIM ING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SUBSTANCE THAT PEOPLE ARE BEEN HIGHLY MOTIVEATED TO PURSUE THAT ARE STILL HIGHLY MOTORATED TO PURSUE TO CREATE AND TO CONSUME THAT THEY'LL SPEND MONEY ON AND THAT'S DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT MAKES THEM FEEL GOOD AND THEN IT MAKES THEM FEEL LOUSY NOW SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE SAYING WELL I DRINK BUT I DON'T DRINK TO EXCESS AND THEREFORE I DON'T FEEL LOUSY I FEEL GOOD WHEN I DRANK AND THEN IT WEARS OFT AND AT LOWS ME GET THROUGH MY EVENING AND THEN THE NEXT MORNING I'M READY TO GO O K OM THAT VERY WELL MAY BE TRUE I BELIEVE THOSE PEOPLE AND AS I MENTION THE BEGINNING THE EPISODE O'M NGHT HERE TO DEMONIZE ALCOHOL IN ANY WAY BUT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT WHAT ALCOHOL IS AND HOW IT CREATES THE EFFECTS THAT IT DOES AND THEN I WANT TO TALC ABOUT WHAT THOSE EFFACTS ARE WHEN YOU ENGAGE IN CONSUMING ALCOHOL EVEN IS OFTEN IS ONE OR TWO NIGHTS PER WEEK OR LET' SAY YOU'RE JUST SOMEBODY YOU AS A DRINK OR TWO ON FRIDAY MAY BE A FEW MORE ON SATURDAY OR MAYBE OR SOMEBODY WHO CONSUMES ALL YOUR ALCHOL ONE NIGHT PER WEEK OR ONE NIGHT PER MONTH WE'LL TALK ABOUT HOW THAT'S EFFECTING YOUR BIOLOGY SO LET'S ADDRESS WHAT ALCOHOL IS AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE CELLS AND TISSUES AND ORGANS OF YOUR BODY THEN WELL TAKE A LOOK AT SOMEOF THE EPIDEMEOLOGY THAT IS HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE CONSUMING ALCHOL AND HOW MUCH THEY'RE DRINKING AND THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE I THINK TO GET A GOOD SENSE OF HOW THE ALCHOL THAT YOU'RE DRINKING IF YOU'RE DRINKING ANY I AT ALL IS IMPACTING YOUR BRAIN AND BODY AND THE CHOICES YOU MIGHT WANT TO MAKE ABOUT HOW AND WHEN TO E DRINK ALCOHOL OR EVEN IF YOU WANT TO ELIMINATE ALCHOL ALTOGETHER O KASO SOME BASIC CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY OF ALCOHOL AND AGAIN I'LL MAKE THIS VERY CLEAR OR EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CHEMISTRY AN BIOLOGY BACKGROUND BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURE OF ALCOHOL IT IS WHAT'S CALLED BOTH WATER SOLUBLE AND FAT SOLUBLE TRANSLATED INTO WHAT'S MEANING FULL FOR YOU WHAT THAT MEANS IS WHEN YOU DRINK ALCOHOL IT CAN PASS INTO ALL THE CELLS AND TISSUES OF YOUR BODY IT HAS NO TROUBLE JUST PASSING RIGHT INTO THOSE CELLS SO UNLIKE A LOT OF SUBSTANCES AND DRUGS THAT ACTUALLY ATTACHED TO THE SURFACE OF CELLS TO RECEPTORS AS THEY'RE CALLED LO PARKING SPOTS AND THEN TRIGGER A BUNCH OF DOWNSTREAMS LIKE DOMINO CASCADES OF EFFECTS ALCOL ACTUALLY HAS ITS OWN DIRECT EFFECTS ON CELLS BECAUSE IT CAN REALLY JUST PASS INTO THOSE CELLS SO IT'S WATER IN FFAT SOLUBLE AND THE FACT THAT IT CAN PASS INTO SO MANY ORGANS AND CELLS SO EASILY IS REALLY WHAT EXPLAINS ITS DAMAGING EFFACTS I SHULL MENTION THAT THEREARE THREE MAINTYPES OF ALCHOL THERE'S ISOPROPOL METHEL AND ETHEL ALCOHOL AND ONLY THE LAST ONE ETHEL ALCOHOL OR ETHAN ALL IS FIT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION HOWEVER IT IS STILL TOXIC O K IT PRODUCES SUBSTANTIAL STRESS AND DAMAGE TO CELLS I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO TELL YOU OTHERWISE BUT THAT'S JUST EFFACT ETHAN ALL PRODUCES SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE TO CELLS AND IT DOES THAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU ENJEST ETHAN AL IT HAS TO BE CONVERTED INTO SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE IT IS TOXIC TO THE BODY AND THERE'S A MOLECULE INSAUT OF ALL OF US LLED AN A D AND YOU MAYHAVE HERT OF AN I D BECAUSE IT'S QUITE POPULAR THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT ANA D IN THE LONGEVITY LITERATURE RIGHT NOW AN A DIS PRESENT IN ALL OURCELLS FROM BERTH UNTIL DEATH THE LEVELS OF AN  D TEN TO GO DOWN ACROSS THE LIFE'S BAND THEIR IDEAS THAT INCREASING LEVELS OF ANA D MAY EXTEND LIFE'S BAND A LOT OF THAT IS TILL CONTROVERSIAL OR AT LEAST WE SHOULD SAY IS ON GOING IN TERMS OF THE RESEARCH BUT NONE THE LESS WHEN YOU JEST ETHAN AL AN A D AND RELATED BAL CHEMICAL PATHWAYS ARE INVOLVED IN CONVERTING THAT ETHAN AL INTO SOMETHING CALLED A SETAL ALTAHIE IT'S BROKEN DOWN INTO A SETALALTOHDE AND IF YOU THOUGHT ETHANAL WAS BAD A SETAL ALDAHIDE IS PARTICULARLY BAD A SETAL ALTAHIDE IS POISON IT WILL KILL CELLS IT DAMAGES AND KILL CELS AND IS INDISCRIMINANT AS TO WHICH CELLS IT DAMAGES AND KILLS NOW THAT'S A PROBLEM OBVIOUSLY AND THE BODY DEALS WITH THAT PROBLEM BY USING ANOTHER COMPONENT OF THE AN  D BAL CHEMICAL PATHWAY TO CONVERT A SEAL ALTOHIDE INTO SOMETHING CALLED ACETATE ACETATE IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT YOUR BODY CAN USE AS FUEL AND THAT PROCESS OF GOING FROM ETHANAL TO A SETAL ALTAHIDE TO AETATE DOES INVOLVE THE PRODUCTION OF A TOXIC MOLECULE AND AGAIN A SETAL ALTHIDE IS REALLY TOXIC AND AN A D AND IF WE WANT TO GET TECHNICAL ITS THE AN D TO AN A D H RATIO AND THAT CHEMICAL STEP IS THE RATE LIMITING STEP TO ETHANAL'S METABOLISM WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR YOU WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IF YOUR BODY CAN'T DO THIS CONVERSION OF ETHANAL TO SETALALDAIDE TO ACETATE FAST ENOUGH WELL A SETAL ALDTAHIDE WILL BUILD UP IN YOUR BODY AND CAUSE MORE DAMAGE SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOUR BODY BE ABLE TO DO THIS CONVERSION VERY QUICKLY AND THE PLACE WHERE IT DOES THAT IS WITHIN THE LIVER AND SELLS WITHIN THE LIVER ARE VERY GOOD AT THIS CONVERSION PROCESS BUT THEY ARE CELLS AND THEY ARE EXPOSED TO THE SETALALTOHIDE IN THE CONVERSION PROCESS AND SO SELLS WITHIN THE LIVER REALLY TAKE A BTING IN THE ALCOLL METABOLISM EVENTS SO THE KEY THING TO UNDERSTAND HERE IS THAT WHEN YOU INJEST ALCALL IT YOU ARE YES IN GJESTING OF POISON AND THAT POISON IS CONVERTED INTO AN EVEN WORSE POISON IN YOUR BODY AND SOME PERCENTAGE OF THAT WORSE POISON IS CONVERTED INTO A FORM OF CALORIES THAT YOU CAN USE TO GENERATE ENERGY GENERATE  T P AND THE REASON WHY ALCALL IS CONSIDERED EMPTY CALORIES IS BECAUSE THAT ENTIRE PROCESS IS VERY METABOLICALLY COSTLY BUT THERE'S NO REAL NEUTRITIVE VALU OF THE CALORIES THAT IT CREATES YOU CAN USE IT FOR IMMEDIATE ENERGY BUT IT CAN'T BE STORED IN ANY KIND OF MEANING FUL OR BENEFICIAL WAY IT DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY VITEMENS IT DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY MENO ACIDS IT DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY FATYACIDS IT'S TRULY EMPT CALORIES I KNOW SOME YE WILL TALK ABOUT SUGAR IS EMPTY CALORIES BUT SUGAR ACTUALLY AS A FAR BETTER FUEL SOURCE THAN ALCOHOL OR ACETATE BUT NONE THE LESS WHEN YOU INJEST ALCALL SOME PERCENTAGE IS BEING SHUTDLED INTO A WORSE POISON AND SOME IS BEING SHUTDLED INTO A FUEL SOURCE NOW THE IMPORTANTING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT IT IS THE POISON THE ESEEDAL ALTOHIDE ITSELF THAT LEADS TO THE EFFECT OF BEING INEBRIATED OR DRUNK THINK MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT THAT BEING DRUNK IS ACTUALLY A POISON INDUCED DESRUPTION IN THE WAY THAT YOUR NUR CIRCUITS WORK AND SO WE SHOULD ASK OURSELVES AT WHICH NERAL CIRCUITS WHAT BRAIN AREAS WHAT BODY ARRIEIS INVOLVED IN FEELING DRUNK RINEBRIATER NOW IN THINKING ABOUT THIS STATE OF BEING TIPSY OR HAPPIERER REALLY DRUNK OR A LITTLE BUT DRUNK WHEN A MENTION SOMETHING I THINK MOST PEOPLE AREN'TOWARE OF AND THAT'S THE FACT THAT FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE REGULAR DRINKERS OR THAT HAVE OUR GENETIC PREDISPOSITION TO ALCOHOLISM WHEN THEY DRINK THEY TEND TO FEEL VERY ENERGIZED AND VERY GOOD FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME AGAIN  PEOPLE HAVE A GENETIC PREDISPOSITION TO ALCOL OR PEOPLE WHO ARE CHRONIC DRINKERS OR EVEN JUST IF YOU RECALL CHRONIC DOESN'T HAVE TO MEAN A TON OF ALCOL BUT THEIR DRINKING ONE OR TWO PERNID OR THEIR EVERY OTHER NIGHT TYPE DRINKERS OR THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY DRINKERS THOSE PEOPLE TYPICALLY EXPERIENCE AND INCREASE IN ALERTNESS AND MOOD WHEN THEY DRINK WHERE AS OCCASIONAL DRINKERS WILL HAVE A BRIEFER MEANING LESS LONG LASTING PERIOD OF FEELING GOOD WHEN THEY DRINK AND THEN MORE QUICKLY TRANSITION INTO A STATE IN WHICH THEIR TIRED OR THEY START LOSING MOTOR SKILLS THEY START SLURING THEIR SPEECH ALSO ON TEPHASIZE THIS DIS DISTINCT FROM TOLERANCE WILL TALK ABOUT TOLERNCE LATER IN EXACTLY WHAT TOLERANCE MEANS BUT I REALLY WON A HIGHLITE THE FACT THAT WHEN PEOPLE INJEST THIS POISON CAUSE INDEED IT IS POISON THE RANGE OF EFFECTS IS VERY DIFFERENT AND YOU CAN RELIABLY PREDICT WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WITH A PREDISPOSITION TO ALCHOLISM AND WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE REGULAR DRINKERS BY THE CONTOUR THE TIMING OF THE DIFFERENT OF FACTS AND AGAIN PEOPLE WHO TEND TO FEEL MORE ALERT AND EXCITED EVERY TIME THEY DRINK THEY TEND TO GET A REAL LIFT THEY BECOMING ON LIFE OF THE PARTY AND THAT LASTS A LONG WHILE THOSE PEOPLE ARE THE ONES THAT REALLY HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT PREDISPOSITION FOR ALCOHOLISM AND THOSE PEOPLE ALSO NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THET ARE DRINKING IN THE AMOUNT OF DRINKING THAT THEYRE DOING EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT FORBLOWN ALCOHOLICS OF COURSE PEOPLE WHO ARE INJUSTING ALCOHOL WHO ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO DRINK ALCOLL HAVE TO BE CONCERN ABOUT DRINK ALCOL FOR OTHER REASONS BECAUSE IT CAN IMPAIR MOTOR FUNCTION AND JUDGMENT ET CETERA BUT IN THINKIG ABOUT THE BIO CHEMICAL EFFECTS OF ALCOM WHAT IT'S DOING TO THE BODY WHAT IT'S DOING IN ALL CASES IS IT'S CONSUMED INTO THE GOT RANK GOES INTO THE STOMAC THELIVER IMMEDIATELY STARTS THIS CONVERSION THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE OF ATHENALTO SEETAL ALTOHIDE TO ASCETATE AND SOME AMOUNT OF A SEEDAL ALTOHIDE AND ASCETATE ARE MAKING INTO THE BRAIN IT CROSSES THE BLOOD BRAINBERRIER AGAIN THE BRAIN HAS THIS FENCE SURROUNDED THAT WE CALL THE BLOOD BRAINBERRIER OR THE B B B MANY THINGS MOSINGS THANKFULLY CAN'T PASS ACROSS THE BLOOD BRAINBERRIER BUT ALCOL BECAUSE ITS WATERAND FAT SOLIBLE JUST CRUISES RIGHT ACROSS THIS FENCE AND INTO THE MILU THE ENVIRONMENTS OF THE BRAIN N WHICH IS MADE UP OF A COUPLE DIFFERENT MAJOR SELTYPES NURON'S NERVE CELLS AND SO CALL GLEAL CELLS WHICH ARE IN BETWEEN THE NERVE CELLS ILL TALK ABOUT THE EFFECTS ON EACH OF THOSE SOON SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ALCALL GETS INTO THE BRAIN THAT MAKES US FEEL TIPSY OR DRUNK AND IN SOME PEOPLE MAKES PEOPLE THEY'LL REALLY ESPECIALLY ENERGIZED AND HAPPY WELL ALCALLS INDISCRIMINATE IN TERMS OF WHICH BRAIN AREAS IT GOES TO AGAIN IT DOESN'T BIND HE PARTICULAR RECEPTORS BUT IT DOES SEEM TO HAVE A PROPENSITY OR AN AFFINITY FOR PARTICULAR BRAIN AREAS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN CERTAIN KINDS OF THINKING AND BEHAVIOR SO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS IT HAPPENS IS THAT THERE'S A SLIGHT AT LEAST AFTER THE FIRST DRINK OR SECOND DRINK THERE'S A SLIGHT SUPPRESSION IN THE ACTIVITY OF NURONS IN THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEC THIS IS AN AREA OF YOUR NEAL QUARTE THAT'S INVOLVED IN THINKING AND PLANNING AND PERHAPS ABOVE ALL IN SUPPRESSION OF IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR SO IF YOU GO TO A PARTY AND THEY'R SERVING ALCHOLL AND PEOPLE ARE CONSUMING DRINKS WHAT YOU'L NOTICE IS THAT A FEW MINUTES INTO THAT PARTY THE VOLUME OF PEOPLE'S VOICES WILL INCREASE AND THAT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SIMPLY NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO THEIR VOICE MOCHULATION AS OTHER PEOPLE STARTS SPEAKING MORE LOUDLY OTHER PEOPLE ARE SPEAKING MORE LOUDLY WE'VE ALL HAVE THIS EXPERIENCE RIGHT OF GOING TO A PARTY AN THE YOU STEP OUTSIDE FOR MOMNI I CANI S OR SHOUTING OR COME O NEXT DAY YOU GOT A SORE THROAT MIGHT BE THAT YOU PICKED UP SOME SORT OF BUG SOME VIRUS OR SOMETHING BUT OFTENTIMES IT'S JUST THE FACT YOU' BEEN SHOUTING ALL NIGHT JUST TO BEHEARD BECAUSE AS THE PREFRONTAL QUARTCS SHUTS DOWN PEOPLE STOP MODULATING THEIR THEIR LEVEL OF SPEECH QUITE AS MUCH ALSO KNOWIS THE PEOPLE START GESTICULATING MORE PEOPLE'S START STANDING UP AND SITTING DOWN MORE THE TART WALKING AROUND MORE IF THERE'S MUSIC ON PEOPLE MIGHT SPONTANEOUSLY START DANCING ALL OF THIS IS BECAUSE THESE AREAS OF THE PREFRONTAL QUARTECS NORMALLY ARE PROVIDING WHAT'S CALL TOP DOWN INHIBITION THEY ARE RELEASING AN NURW TRANSMIT ARE CALLED GABA ON TO VARIOUS PARTS OF THE BRAIN THEIR INVOLVED IN INPULSIVE MOTOR BEHAVIOR AND THOUGHT PATTERNS AND AS YOU SHUT DOWN THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEC THAT GABA URGIT SUPPRESSION OF IMPULSES STARTS TO BE RELYAS SO PEOPLE ISS VAGUTHINGS THAT THEY WANT TO SAY WITHOUT SO MUCH FORETHOUGHT ABOUT WHA THEY'RE SAYING WHOR THEY MIGHT DO THINGS THAT THEY WANT TO DO WITHOUT REALLY THINKING IT THROUGH QUITE AS MUCH WHOR THEY MIGH NOT EVEN REMEMBER THINKING IT THROUGH IT ALL OR EXPERIENCE I SHOULD SAY THINKING IT THROUGH IT ALL WE HAVENT TALKED ABOUT BLACKING OUT YET IN THE EFFECTS OF ALCOLL ON MEMORY BUT S ALLNS WERE THERE I'LL JUST TELL YOU THAT ALCOHOL HAS A VERY STRONG EFFECT IN SUPPRESSING THE NURAL NETWORKS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN MEMORY FORMATION AND STORAGE IS IS WHY OFTENTIMES WE FORGET THE EVENTS OF A NIGHT OUT IF WE'VE BEEN DRINKING ONE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF ALCO THE BRAIN IS THIS DESTRUPTION IN TOP DOWN IN IBITION BUT ALSO THAT AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE INVOLVED IN FLEXIBLE BEHAVIOR SO F CONSIDERING DIFFERENT OPTIONS LIKE I COULD DO AR I COULD DO BE I COULD SEE THIS TO THAT MARCUT SAY THAT I COULD SAY T IN THAT WAY OR I COULD SAY IT IN THIS WAY THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE TACTFUL THOSE BRAIN ARIAS BASICALLY SHUT DOWN ENTIRELY AND PEOPLE JUST TEND TO SAY WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY SO T E KEETHING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE DRINK THE PREFRONTS OF QUARTEC AND TOP DOWN INHIBITION IS DIMINISHED THAT IS HABITUAL BEHAVIOR AND IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR STARTS TO INCREASE THAT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THIS IS TRUE IN THE SHORT TERM SO AFTER PEOPLE HAVE ONE OR TWO MAY BE THREE OR FOR DRINKS BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT THE MORE OFTEN THAT PEOPLE DRINK THERE ARE CHANGES IN THE VERY CIRCUITS THAT UNDERLIE HABITUAL AND IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT HIGHLIGHT SO MUCH SO THAT I WANT TO DRILL INTO IT A A BIT MORE DEEPLY FOR THE PERSON THAT DRINK SAY EVERY THURSDAY NIGHT OR EVERY FRIDAY NIGHTOR GOES OUT ONLY ON SATURDAYS BUT EVERY SATURDAY THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT THERE ARE CHANGES IN THE NURL CIRCUITS OF THE BRAIN THAT CONTROL HABITUAL BEHAVIOR AND IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR AND THEY ARE MODIFIED AND STRENGTHEN IN WAYS THAT MAKE THOSE PEOPLE MORE HABITUAL AND MORE IMPULSIVE OUTSIDE THE TIMES IN WHICH THEY ARE DRINKING AND WHEN THEY DRINK IMPULSIVE IN HABITUAL BEHAVIOR TENDS TO INCREASE EVEN FURTHER THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S NOT OFTEN TALKED ABOUT WHEN DISCUSSING THE EFFECTS OF ALCHOL AND WE ALL KNOW THE EFFECTS OF BEING DRUNK CAN BE BAD RIHT CAN BE BAD INTERMS OF JUDGMENT MOTOR CORDINATION CERTAINLY DRIVING DRUNK IS A TERRIBLE THING GET YOU OR AND OTHER PEOPLE KILLED AND SO ON BUT RARELY DO WE HEARABOUT THE CHANGES IN NURL CIRCUITS FROM JUST ONE OR TWO NIGHTS OF REGULAR DRINKING AGAIN CHRONIC DRINKING DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN EVERY DAY AND EVERY NIGHT IT CAN BE THE PERSON THAT SIMPLY DRINKS EVERY THURSDAY OR EVERY FRIDAY OR JUS ONCE A WEEK HAS THREE OR FOUR DRINKS OR MAY BE EVEN A FEW MORE THAT PERSON IS GOING TO EXPERIENCE A DECREASE IN THIS TOP DOWN IN HIBITION SO AN INCREASE IN IMPULSIVITY AND HABITUAL BEHAVIOR BECAUSE THE BREAK ON THOSE BEHAVIORS HAS BEEN REMOVED WHILE THEIR DRINKING BUT ALSO CHANGES IN THE VERY NURL CIRCUITS THAT ALLOW HABITUAL IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR TO OCCURB MORE READILY EVEN WHEN THEY'RE NOT DRINKING ANDIF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE ACTUAL SUBSTRAIT FOR THAT THE SELLAR SUBSTRAT I CAN BRIEFLY DESCRIBE IT ITS REALLY INTERESTING AGAIN YOU DON'T LY KNOW AN Y BALEGIE T UNDERSTAND THIS WHAT IT DOES IS IT INCREASES THE NUMBER OF SINAPSES THE ACTUAL POINTS OF CONNECTION IN THE NURL CIRCUITS THAT CONTROL HABITUAL BEHAVIOR SO THERE'S LITERALLY A GROWTH OF THE NURLS CIRCUITS IN YOUR BRAIN THAT LEAD TO EXISTING HABIT EXECUTION RIGHT THE PERFORMANCE OF THINGS YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW TO DO AND A REDUCTION IN THE NURL CIRCUITS WHERE I SHOULD SAY A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF SINAPSES OF THE CONTACTS WITHIN THE NURL CIRCUITS THAT ARE CONTROLLING BEHAVIOR SO THIS AGAIN IS NOT OFTEN DISCUSSED ASPECT OF ALCOHOL AN TAKE FORTUNATELY IT IS REVERSIBLE SO IN ANIMALS ARE HUMANS THAT UNDERTAKE A PERIOD OF ABSTINENCE OF ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO SIX MONTHS THESE NURL CIRCUITS WERE RETURNE TO NORMAL EXCEPTING CASES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CRONICALLY DRINKING LARGE VOLUMES OF ALCHOL FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND IN THOSE CASES WHILE THERE IS SOME RECOVERY OF BRAIN CIRCUITRY AFTER A PEOPLE GET SOBER MEANING COMPLETELY SOBER A STOP DRINKING ENTIRELY THERE IS EVIDENCE OF LONG LASTING IMPACT OF HEAVY ALCOHOL USAGE THROUGH ALCOLIFE SPAN BUT OF COURSE THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT ANY ONE THAT SUFFERING FROM ALCOHOLISM OR THAT USED TO SHOULD NOT CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON THEIR HEALTH YOU ABSOLUTELY SHOULD ALL IS NOT LOST BUT FOR PEOPLE THAVE BEEN DRINKING FOR LOT YEARS MAY BE YOU WENT TO COLLEGE AND YOU DRANK A LOT IN THOSE YEARS AND YOUR NERAL CIRCUITS CHANGE IF THERE'S A PERIOD IN WHICH YOU DON'T DRINK ALCOHOL AGAIND FROM TWO TO SIX MONTHS AND IDEALLY LONGER THOSE NERL CIRCUITS CAN THEN BE REMODIFY BACT TO THEIR ORIGINAL STATE SO LET'S CONSIDER SOME OF THE OTHER NEURO CHEMICAL EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON THE BRAIN AND BODY AND AGAIN FOR RIGHT NOW WERE CONFINING THE CONVERSATION TO PEOPLE THAT OARE DRINKING ON AVERAGE ONE OR TWO DRINKS PER NIGHT NOW SOME PEOPLE MIG THING THAT TWO DRINKS PER NIGHT IS A LOT AND A LOT OF THAT WILL DEPEND ON BODY WEIGHTS SO FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE WHO WEIGH A HUNDRED AND TEN POUNDS FOR THEM TO INJEST TO ALCOHOLIC DRINKS IS GOING TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF THE BALCHEMICAL EFFECTS THEN SOMEBODY WHO WEIGHTS TWO HUNDRED AN TWENTY POUNDS OF COURSE TOLERANCE WILL ALSO FACTOR INTO THIS GENETIC BACKGROUND WILL ALSO FACTOR INTO THIS AND INDEED WHETHER NOT PEOPLE HAVE EATEN WILL FACTOR INTO THIS SO THAT A LOT OF FACTORS AND WILL TALK ABOUT THAT FOR THE TIME BEING IF YOU'RE CURIOUS ABOUT HOW FOOD IN PACTS THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL AND YOUR FEELINGS OF BEING DRUNK YOU MAY HAVE HEARD FOR INSTANCE THAT IF SOMEBODY'S INEBRIATED AN THEY WANT A SOBER UP THEY SHOULD EAT SOMETHING TURNS OUT THAT DOES NOT WORK HERE'S HOW IT DOES WORK HOWEVER IF YOU EAT SOMETHING PRIOR TO DRINKING ALCOHOL OR WHILE INJESTING ALCOHOL IT WILL SLOW THE ABSORPTION OF ALCHOL INTO THE BLOOD STREAM IN OTHER WORDS YOU WON'T FEEL AS DRUNK AS FAST FROM ANY OF YOU THIS PROBABLY COMES IS NO SURPRISE IN PARTICULAR IF THAT MEAL INCLUDES CARBOHYDRATES FATS AND PROTINES I THE INCLUSION OF ALL THREE MAJOR MACERO NEUTRIENT SEEMS TO SLOW THE ABSORPTION OF ALCHOL INTO THE LOOD STREAM FAR MORE THAN ANY THEN HAVING ANY ONE OF THOSE OR TWO OF THOSE MACHRNUTRIANS PRESENT NOW IF YOU ARE ALREADY INEBRIATED OR YOU'VE HAD A GLASS OF WINEOR OR A BEARING YOU EAT SOMETHING CHANCES ARE THAT ALCOHL IS ALREADY MADE IT INTO YOUR BLOOD STREAM BECAUSE IT MOVES INTO THE BLOOD STREAM SO QUICKLY AGAIN IT'S FAT SOLUABLE AND WATER SOLUBLE SO WITHIN MINUTES IF YOU'R ON IF YOU HAVE AN EMPTY STOMACH WITHIN FIVE TO TEN MINUTES THAT ALCOHOL ITS GOING TO BE WITHIN YOUR BLOODSTREAM IN DISTRIBUTED THRUGHOUT YOUR BODY MAY BE EVEN FASTER DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF ALCHL AND YOUR METABOLISM BUT IF YOU'RE ALREADY DRUNK AND YOU EAT SOMETHING IT'S NALK IN A SOBER YOU UT MORE QUICKLY BUT IT CERTAINLY WILL BLUNT THE EFFECTS OF ANY ADDITIONAL ALCHOL THAT YOU MIGHT CONSUME AND IF YOU'R SOMEBODY WHO IS CONCERNED ABOUT GETTING TOO DRUNK TOO QUICK EVEN FROM A SMALL AMOUNT OF ALCOL HAVING SOME FOOD IN YOUR GOT CAN CERTAINLY BE BENEFICIAL NOW THAT'S FOOD IND ALCOHOL IN THE ABSORPTION OF ALCHOL BUT LET'S GO BACK TO TALKING ABOUT THE BY CHEMICAL AND NEURO CHEMICAL EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON THE BRAIN WE TALKED ABOUT TOPDOWN IN IBITION AND WE TALKED ABOUT HABITUAL AND IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOUR CIRCUITRY THERE ARE ALL CO DRUMATIC CHANGES IN THE ACTIVITY OF NURONS THAT CONTROLL THE RELEASE OF SO CALLED CERATONAN CERATONAN IS A NEUROMODULATOR IT CHANGES THE ACTIVITY OF NEURAL CIRCUITS AND MANY NEURAL CIRCUITS IN PARTICULAR THOSE INVOLVED IN MOOD AND FEELINGS OF WELL BEING RECENTLY THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF INTEREST IN CERATONAN BECAUSE OF A STUDY THAT WAS RELEASED THAT SHOWED PRETTY CONCLUSIVELY THAT CERATONAN LEVELS CAN'T REALLY EXPLAIN DEPRESSION AND DEPRESSION LIKE SYMPTOMS I WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT ALTHOUGH THAT STUDY DID SHOW THAT CRATONAN LEVELS ARE NOT NECESSARILY ASSOCIATE WITH DEPRESSION THE STUDY WAS INTERPRETED BY MANY TO MEAN THAT ESSESSORISE SELECTIVE CERATONAN REUPTAKE CONHIBITORS WHICH HAVE THE NET EFFECT OF INCREASING CERATONAS THESE ARE THINGS LIKE PROSAC ET CETERA THAT THOSE DRUGS ARE SOMEHOW NOT HELPFUL BECAUSE THEY INCREASE CERATONAN AND CARATONAN ISN'T INVOLVED IN DEPRESSION THAT LOGIC DOESN'T REALLY HOLD TOGETHER STOMANUS AS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO JUST CLARIFY WHAT REALLY OCCURRED THERE AND THEN WILL TALK ABOUT HOW CERATONAN RELATES TO ALCOL CONSUMPTION IN THINGS LIKE FEELING GOOD AND IN DEPRESSION THE KEYTHING IS THIS ESSESS ARISE CAN HELP ALLEVIATE DEPRESSION THAT'S RIGHT ESSESSORISE CAN HELP ALLEVIATE DEPRESSION THEY ARE OFTEN NOT ALWAYS ASSOCIATE WITH SIDEIFACTS DOSAGES VERY IMPORTANT ET CETERA BUT THEY PROBABLY SUPPORT RELIEF FROM DEPRESSION BY CHANGING NEURAL CIRCUITS NOT NECESSARILY BY INCREASING CERATONA ITSELF THAT IS INCREASING RATONAN WITH THESE DRUGS LIKELY CHANGE THE NEURL CIRCUITS INVOLVED IN MOOD ALLOWING PEOPLE TO FEEL BETTER THROUGH SO CALLED NEUROL PLASTISY WHICH IS THE BRAINS ABILITY TO CHANGE ITSELF AND RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE SO THERE'S A BIT A CONFUSION AND AGAIN AMUSING THIS EPISODE ON ON ALCOHOL TO HIGLIGHT SOME OF THE CONFUSION BECAUSE I THINK ITS TIMELY BECAUSE THE STUDY JUST CAME OUT AN THERES ALATO CHATTER ABOUT THIS OUT THERE THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE DEPRESSED ITS NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE CERATONAN LEVELS ARE LOW HOWEVER IF CERATONN LEVELS ARE INCREASED WITH THINGS LIKE PROSAC SO OFT AND OTHER ESSESSORISE OFTENTIMES THERE IS YES A RELIEF FROM DEPRESSION BUT THAT'S PROBABLY NOT BECAUSE OF RESTORING CARATONAN LEVELS PERSAY IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE CRATONAN FACILITATES THE CHANGES IN NEURAL CIRCUITS THAT NEED TO OCCUR IN ORDER TO FOR PEOPLE TO FEEL ELEVATED MOOD OCE SO AGAIN THAT'S A BIT OF A TANGENT IN ASIDE BUT I DO THING ITS A VITAL ONE FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT AGAIN YOUR THING ABOUT TAKING ESCESSORISE YOUR CURRENTLY TAKING THEM AND HOVE HURRD THIS NEWS DEFILY TALKED YOUR DOCTOR AGAIN THERE IS GREAT UTILITY FOR SOME OF TESE ESSESSORISE AND ALSO AND CONDITIONS LIKE OS D THEY'VE BEEN SHOWN TO BE VERY BENEFICIAL SO WE REALLY DON'T WANT TO THROESSESSORISE OUT AS A POTENTIALLY VALUABLE TREATMENT GETTING BACK TO THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON CERATONAN IT'S VERY CLEAR BEYOND ANY DOUBT THAT MANY OF THE CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN THAT ARE INVOLVED IN MOOD AND FEELINGS OF WELL BEING AND ALSO SO SELF IMAGE IN HOW WE SEE OUR SELVES EMPLOY THE NEUROMODULATOR CERATONAN AN ALCOHOL WHEN WE INJEST IT AND IT'S CONVERTED INTO A CETAL LL THE HIDE IT GOES AND THT A SEETAL ALTOHIDE ACTS AS A TOXIN AT THE VERY SYNAPSES THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE START AND URGENT NURONS AND LOTS OF OTHER NURANS IN OTHER WORDS WHEN WE INJEST ALCHOL THE TOXIC EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL DISRUPT THOSE MOOD CIRCUITRIES AT FIRST MAKING THEM HYPEERACTIVE THAT'S RIGHT MAKING THEM HYPERACT IF THISE WHY PEOPLE BECOME REALLY TALKATIVE PEOPLE TART TO FEEL RELLY GOOD AFTER A FEW SIPS OF ALCOL THESE MOST PEOPLE DO AND THEN AS THEY CONJEST MORE ALCOHOL OR AS THAT ALCHOL WEARS OFF CERATONE AND LEVELS AND THE ACTIVITY THOSE CIRCUITS REALLY STARTS TO DROP AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE FEEL LESS GOOD AND TYPICALLY WHAT THEY DO THEY GO AND GET ANOTHER DRINK AND THEY ATTEMPT TO  RESTORE THAT FEELING OF WELL BEING IN MOOD NOW TYPICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT AS PEOPLE IN JEST THE THIRD AND FOURTH MAY BEVEN THE FIFTH DRINK THERE'S AN ABSOLUTE ZERO CHANCE OF THEM RECOVERING THAT ENERGIZED MOOD RIGHT MOST PEOPLE AS THEY DRINK MORE AND MORE WILL NOW START TO FEEL MORE AND MORE SUPPRESSED THE FOREBRAIN IS NOW SHUTTING DOWN QUITE A LOT A LOT OF THE MOTOR CORTICAL AREAS THAT CONTROL CORDINATED MOVEMENT AND DELIBERATE MOVEMENTS ARE TO SHUT DOWN SO PEOPLE STARTS OF THURTHER SPEUCH PEOPLE START TO SHUFFLE THEIR FEET PEOPLE FORGET THEIR POSTURE PEOPLES ARE TO LEAN ON THINGS PEOPLE START PASSING OUT ON COUCHES THERE'S A GREAT DEPRESSION NOT DEPRESSION OF THE PSYCHIATRIC DEPRESSION SORT BUT A DEPRESSION OF ALERTNESS AND AROUSAL AND EVENTUALLY PEOPLE WILL PASS OUT NOW I SAID MOST PEOPLE BECAUSE THERE'S A SUBSET OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE GENE VARIANCE OR WHO ARE CHRONIC DRINKERS OR WHO ARE CHRONIC DRINKERS AND HAVE GENE VARIANCE THAT AS THEY INJEST THE THIRD AND FOURTH AND FIFTH DRINK WHAT HAPPENS THEY BECOME MORE ALERT THEY STARE TALKING MORE THEY FEEL GREAT THEY HAVE ALL SORTS OF IDEAS ABOUT THE FUN THEY COULD HAVE THAT NIGHT AND THEYRE THE ONES THAT IF YOUVE EVER FALLEN A SLEEP AT A PARTY FOR WHATEVER REASON OR YOU GETTING TIRED IN OUR YAWNING AN LOOKING ROUND THE ROOM AND LIKE THESE PEOPLE ARE STILL DRINKING AND PARTING AND THEIR HAVING WHAT SEEMS TO BE THIS AMAZING TIME OFTEN NOT ALWAYS THOSE ARE THE FUTURE ALCOHOLICS IN THE ROOM OR THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE A GENETIC PREDISPOSITION FOR ALCOHOLISM OR THOSE OF THE CHRONIC DRINKERS THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BUILT UP ENOUGH FOR HE TOLERANCE OR WHO HAVE THE CHEMICA GENETIC MAKE UP SUCH THAT INCREASING AMOUNTS OF ALCOHOL MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER AND OF COURSE THEY TOO HAVE A THRESHOLD BEYOND WHICH THEIR NERVOU SYSTEM WIL START TO GET DIMINISHED AND THEY'LL PASS OUT ANDFALL OVER ET CETERA BUT THAT THRESHOLD IS WAYWAY HIGHER THAN IT IS FOR MOST PEOPLE THIS IS IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND AND IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IY THINK EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW AND RECOGNIZE THEIR OWN PREDISPOSITION AND KIND OF RISK IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING ALCOHOLISM IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT RELATES TO THE PHENOMENON OF BLACK OUT YOU MANY PEOPLE THINK THAT BLACKING OUT AS PASSING OUT BUT BLACK OUT DRUNK IS WHEN PEOPLE DRINK AND THEIR TALKING AND DOING THINGS SOMETIMES SADLY THE LL OR TRAGICALLY THEY'LL OFTEN DRIVE HOME OR WALK HOME OR THEY HOP ON BICYCLE AND RIDE HOME OR THOUG GO SWIMMING IN THE OCEAN ALL OF COURSE VERY DANGEROUS ACTIVITIES TO DO WHEN PEOPLE ARE REALLY DRUNK OR EVEN A LITTLE BIT DRUNKEN SOME CASES SO THESE PEOPLE WLL DO THESE SORTS OF THINGS AND THEY DO THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE ENERGY TO DO THEM AND THEY FEEL GOOD WHILE DOING THEM BUT THEY ARE DOING THEM WHELL THE ACTIVITY OF NURONS IN THE HYPOCAMPUS WHICH IS INVOLVED IN MEMORY FORMATION ARE COMPLETELY SHUT OFF AND THIS IS WHY THE NEXT DAY YOU TELL THEM AT MAY WISH TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPEN LAST NIGHT WE'LL HAVE AN LAST NIGHT SIT WOO DO YOU REMEMBER GOING THE PARTO YENO AS GREAT WE DO THIS WE DO THIS AND THEN WHAT AND IT'S VERY CLEAR ALL A SUDDEN THAT THEY HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF ALL THE THINGS THEY WERE DOING DESPITE BEING AWAKE NOW I WISH I COULD TELL YOU THAT THE SOME SORT OF BLOOD TAST OR OTHER BILMARK OR EVEN A FINGER PRINT TEST THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE A PROPENSITY TO BE ONE OF THESE DRINKERS THAT AS A PREDISPOSITION FOR ALCOHOLISM AND IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN BLACK OUT DRUNK AND CERTAINLY TOYUVE BEEN BLACK OUT DRUNK MORE THAN A FEW TIMES YOU SHOULD BE QUITE CONCERN AND AS WE TALK MORE ABOUT THE MOR CHRONIC OFFECTS AND LONG LASTING EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION LIL BIT LATER IN THE EPISODE THINK IT WILL BECOME CLEAR AS TO WHY YOU SHOULD BE CONCERNED BUT IN ANY CASE THERE IS SOMETHING THAT CAN TELL YOU WHETHER OR NOT YOU MIGHT BE IN THAT CATEGORY VERSES LIKELY NOT IN THAT CATEGORY ND I ALLUDED TO THIS A COUPLE OF TIMES ALREADY BUT I WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR THAT WHEN PEOPLE DRINK NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE AINITIALLY THERE'S THAT SHUTTING DOWN OF THOSE PREFRONTAL CORTICAL CIRCUITS THERE'S A GRADUAL SHUTTING DOWN O THE CIRCUITS THE CONTROL MEMORY BUT THEN PEOPLE DIVIDE INTO THESE TWO BINS AND THESE TWO BINS ARE THE PEOPLE WHO AFTER MORE THAN A COUPLE OF DRINK START TO FEEL SEDATED AND THE PEOPLE WHO AFTER MORE THAN A FEW DRINKS DO NOT START TO FEEL SEDATED NOW OF COURSE THEREIS GOING TO BE DIFFERENCES CREATED BY HOW QUICKLY PEOPLE ARE DRINKING WHETHER NOT THEIR COMBINING DIFFERENT TYPES OF ALCOHOL THE TYPES OF ALCOL ET CETERA BUT IN GENERAL THAT CAN PREDICT WHETHER NOT YOUR SOMEBODY WHO HAS A PREDISPOSITION FOR ALCOHOLISM OR NOT ONE ALSO VERY INTERESTING FINDING IS THAT ALCOHOL CHANGES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WHAT'S CALLED THE HYPOTHALMUS AND THE PETUITARY GLAND AND THE ADRENALS NOW THE HYPOTHALMUS IS A SMALL COLLECTION OF NURONS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A LARGE GUMBOLE SITS ABOVE THE ROFOR YOUR MOUTH AND HOUSES NURONS THEIR RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME INCREDIBLE ASPECTS OF OUR BEHAVIOR AND ARE MIND SET THINGS LIKE RAGE THINGS LIKE SEC DRIVE THINGS LIKE TEMPERATURE REGULATION VERY PRIMITIVE FUNCTIONS CLUDING APPETITE THIRST ET CETERA ALCOHOL BECAUSE IT CAN GO ANYWHERE IN THE BRAIN REMEMBERANCE WATER AND FAT SOLUBLE HAS EFFECTS ON THE HYPOTHALMUS THE HYPOTHALMUS NORMALLY PROVIDES VERY SPECIFIC SIGNALS TO WHATS CALLED THE PETUITARY GLAND THIS IS A WOL GLAND THAT ACTUALLY STICKS OUT OF THE BRAIN BUT IT RECEIVES INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE HYPOTHALMUS AND THEN THE PETUITARY RELEASES HOR RMONS INTO THE BLOODSTREAM THAT GO AND TALK TO YOUR A DRENALS YOUR DREAM OF LANDS IT RIGHT ABOVE YOUR KIDNEYS IN YOUR LOWER BACK AND THE DREAMALS RELEASE AS THE NAME SUGGESTS A DRENALAN ALSO CALLED AP AN EFRANT AND ALSO A MOLECULECAL CORTISAL WHICH IS INVOLVED IN THE LONGER TERM STRESS RESPONSE AS SOME HEALTHY EFFECTS TO ON THE AMEAN SYSTEM O CASE O THE HYPOTHOLAMIC PETUITARY A DREMAL AXIS I KNOW IT'S A MOUTHFUL YOU DON'T NEED TO REMEMBER THE NAMES BUT THE HYPOTHELEMIC PETUITARY DREMAL AXIS MAINTAINS YOUR PHYSIOLOGICAL BALANCE OF WHAT YOU PERCEIVE AS STRESSFUL AN WHAT YOU DON'T PERCEIVE I STRESSFUL PEOPLE WHO DRINK REGULARLY SO THIS AGAIN COULD BE JUST ONE OR TWO DRINKS PER NIGHT OR COUL BE SOMEBODY THAT DRINKS JUST ON FRIDAYS ORE JUST ON SATURDAYS OR MAY BE JUST ON THE WEAK AND TWO TO FOUR DRINKS WILL THOSE PEOPLE EXPERIENCE CHANGES IN THEIR HYPOTHLEMIC PETUITARY A DREMALAXIS THAT RESULT IN MORE CORTISAL MORE OF THIS SO CALLED STRESS HORMONE BEING RELEASED AT BASELINE WHEN THEY ARE NOT DRINKING THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT PEOPLE WHO DRINK A BIT AND WHEN I SAY A BIT I DON'T MEAN ONE OR TWO SEPS OR EVEN A GLASS OF WINE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I MEAN AGAIN PEOPLE THAT A MAY BE HAVING ONE DRINK A NIGHT WITH DINNER AND MAYBE ON THE WEAKEN A FEW MORE CAN I OFFER A BUNCH OR DFFERENT PATTERNS TO EXPLAIN HOW IT COULD ALSO BE TWO OR THREE DRINKS ON FRIDAY OR SIX DRINKS ONLY ON SATURDAY WILL ALL OF THOSE GROUPS EXPERIENCE INCREASES IN CORTIS ALL RELEASE FROM THEIR DREMAL GLANDS WHEN THEY ARE NOT DRINKING AND AS A CONSEQUENCE THEY FEEL MORE STRESSET IN MORE ANXIETY WHEN THEY AREN'T DRINKING THIS IS A SELDOM TALKED ABOUT EFFECT OF ALCOHOL BECAUSE SO OFTEN WE HEAR ABOUT THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL AND WEVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THOSE EFFECTS EFFECTS LIKE REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF STRASS I MEAN HOW MANY TIMES IF WE HEARD SOMEBODY TIT  I NEED OR DRINK AND TH THEY HAVE A DRINK TAND CALM DOWN NOW THEY CAN SHAKE OFF THE THOUGHTS ABOUT THE DAYS WERE THEY CAN START TO THINK ABOUT THINGS IN A MAY MORE GROUNDED OR RATIONAL WAY OR AT LEAST THEY BELIEVE THAT OR THEY CAN SOMEHOW JUST RELAX THEMSELVES WELL WHILE THAT VERY WELL MAY BE TRUE THAT IT CAN RELAX THEM WHEN THEY ARE NOT DRINKING THAT LEVEL OF CORTISOLL THAT'S RELEASED AT BASELINE HAS INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY AGAIN THIS RELATES TO A DEFINE NERAL CIRCUIT PBETWEEN BRAIN AND BODY AND IT HAS TO DO WITH THE RATIO OF CORTISAL TO SOME OF THE OTHER HORMONES INVOLVED IN THE STRESS RESPONSE WILL PROVIDE A REFERENCE TO THE STUDY THAT DESCRIBES HOW OLD THIS WORKS FOR THOSE WHO THAT REALLY WANT TO DELVIN TO IT BUT LET'S GO BACK TO THIS ISSUE OF THOSE WHO ARE PRONE TO ALCOHOLISM VERSES THOSE WHO ARE NOT REMEMBER THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE GUNETIC VARIANCE THAT MEANING GENES THAT THEY INHERITED FROM THEIR PARENTS THAT MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAT THEY WILL BECOME ALCOHOLIX BUT THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE WHO DRINK OFTEN WHO START TO EXPERIENCE THIS INCREASE IN ALERTNESS THE LONGER THEY DRINK ACROSS THE NIGHT PART OF THAT EFFECT WE THINK IS BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN THIS HYPOTHOLEMIC PETUITARY A DREALAXIS S OU ALCOL IS KIND OF A DOUBLE HIT IN THIS SENSE IT'S CAUSING CHANGES IN OUR BRAIN CIRCUITRY IN NARROW CHEMISTRY THAT AT THE TIME IN WHICH WERE INEBRIATED ARE DETRIMENTAL AND IT'S CAUSING CHANGES IN NEURAL CIRCUITRY THAT PERSIST LONG PAST THE TIME IN WHICH WE'RE EXPERIENCING THE FEELING OF BEING TIPSY OR DRUNK NOW AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO DEMONIZE ALCOHOL I'M NOT SAYING OH YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A GLASS AWINE NOW AND AGAIN OR YOU DRINK A BEAR NOW AND AGAIN OR EVEN HAVE OM YOU KNOW A MIXTURINK NOW AND AGAIN WERE A SHOT THAT THAT'S NECESSARILY TERRIBLE FOR YOU I CERTAINLY DO NOT WANT THAT TO BE THE MESSAGE WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT IF PEOPLE ARE INGESTING ALCALL CHRONICALLY EVEN IF IT'S NOT EVERY NIGHT THERE ARE WELL RECOGNIZED CHANGES IN NEURL CIRCUITS THEIRE WELL RECOGNIZED CHANGES IN NEURO CHEMISTRY WITHIN THE BRAIN AND THERE WELL RECOGNIZE CHANGES IN THE BRAIN TO BODY STRESS SYSTEM THAT GENERALLY POINT IN THREE DIRECTIONS INCREASED STRESS WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT DRINKING DIMINISHED MOOD AND FEELINGS OF WELL BEING WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT DRINKING AND AS YOU'LL SOON LEARN CHANGES IN THE NEURAL CIRCUITRY THAT CAUSE PEOPLE TO WANT TOTRINK EVEN MORE IN ORDER TO GET JUST BACK TO BASE LINE WER THE PLACE THAT THEY WERE IN TERMS OF THEIR STRESS MODULATION AND IN TERMS THEIR FEELINGS OF MOOD BEFORE THEY EVER STARTED DRINKING THE FIRST PLACE SO AGAIN I DON'T WANT TOD TO DEMONIZE ALCOHOL BUT I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THERE ARE LONG TERM PLASTIC CHANGES MEANING CHANGES IN NEURL CIRCUITRY IN HORMONE CIRCUITRY THAT ACROSS A PERIOD OF SEVERAL MONTHS AND CERTAINLY ACROSS A PERIOD OF YEARS OF THE SORTS OF DRINKING PATTERNS I DESCRIBED WHICH I THINK FOR MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SOUND LIKE PRETTY TYPICAL RIDI I M NOTHING THAT I DESCRIBE SO FAR WAS ABOUT DRINKING A CASE ANNITE OR OR ABOUT BINGING ON ALCOHOL IN THE WAYS THAT WE OFTEN HERE ABOUT IT IN THE NEWS IS ARE PRETTY COMMON PATTERNS OF OF ALCOL CONSUMPTION MEAN ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BORE TO TRANS AN LANTIC FLIGHT OR A SHU GO TO AN AIRPORT ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON IN A SUNNY AREA OF THE USAND EN ON PEOPLE ARE HAVING THREE FOUR OR FIVE SIX BEARS ET CETERA THAN PERSONAL CHOICE IS PERSONAL CHOICE AR NOT TELLING Y WHAT TO DO BUT S VERY CLEAR THAT THOSE SORTS OF DRINKING PATTERNS ARE CHANGING NEURAL CIRCUITRY AND THEIR CHANGING HORMONE CIRCUITRY AND I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TEL YOU THAT THEY'R CHANGING THEM FOR BETTER BUT THEY SIMPLY ARE NOT THEIR ASHLY CHANGING THEM FOR THE WORSE AND WORSE IS DEFIND IS MAKING PEOPLE LESS RESILIENT DISTRESS HIGHER LEVELS OF BASELINE STRESS AND LOWER MOOD OVER ALL I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ITHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED A G ONE IS A VITEM IN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AN TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS IND THE REASON I STILL TAKE OTHLETIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO BE THE PROBIATICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GOT IS VERY IMPORTANT ITS POPULATED BY GOT MICROBYODA THAT COMMUNI CCATE WITH THE BRAIN THE AMUN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIATICS AN OTHLETIC GREENS ARE APTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLETIC GREENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTEGENS VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL F MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTEGRIGHT IF YOU' LIKE TO TRYATH LETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN SDOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD IN THE CAR ON THE PLANE ET CETERA AND THEY'L GIVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TOO AGAIND THAT ATHLETIC GREEN DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEARS SUPPLY OF VITEMIND THRE K TO NOW I'VE BEEN TALKING A LITIBIT ABOUT GENETIC PREDISPOSITION BUT THERE ARE COUPLE OF IMPORTANT POINTS I LIKE TO MAKE ABOUT THAT FIRST OF ALL WHAT SORTS OF GENES ARE INVOLVED IN SETTING SOME ONE DOWN THE PATH OF ALCOHOLISM OR NOT WELL IT SHOULD COME IS NO SURPRISE THAT THE GENES THAT CRONIC ALCOHOL USAGE MODIFIES THEY TEND TO FALL PRIMARILY IN THE PATHWAYS RELATED TO GENETIC CONTROL OVER CERATONAN RECEPTORS GABA RECEPTORS REMEMBER THAT TOP DOWN INIBITION AND INVOLVEMIN AGABA AND NO SURPRISE THE H P  THE HYPOTHOLAMIC PATUITARY AXIS ALL OF THOSE OF COURSE COMBINE WITH ENVIRONMENT THAT COMBINE WITH PATTERNS OF ABUSE RIGHT WE KNOW THAT IF YOU ARE IN A SOCIAL SETTING WERE LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DRINKING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GDRINK IS MUCH HIGHER SOCIAL PRESSURES TROMA RIGHT SOME PEOPLE WILL USE ALCOL TO SELPH METICATE TO TRY AND TURN OFF THEIR THINKING OR TO DEAL WITH AMTRAMA ET CETERA SO THEY COMBINE WITH THE ENVIRONMENT BUT THE GENES THAT ARE IN THE CERETONAN SYNTHESIS AND RECEPTOR SYNTHESIS PATHWAY GABA AND EACH PE AX AS COMBINE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURES TO GIVE RISE TO ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS SO THERE'S A FAIRLY COHERENT PICTURE THAT WE HAVE HERE RIGHT THIS IS NOT A CASE WHERE FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE THAT HAVE A LOT OF THE ENZIM FROM ATAVOLIZING ALCL WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT IN A MINUTE ALCOL DE HYDRAGENES IT'S NOT LIKE THEY ARE NECESSARILY THE PEOPLE THAT BECOME ALCOHOLICS WHEREAS CERTAINLY IN CERTAIN CULTURES CERTAIN ASIEN CULTURES IN PARTICULAR THERE ARE GENE DIFFERENCES THAT LEAD THEM TO HAVE LOW LEVELS OF ALCOL DE HYDRAGENES THEIRE ACTUI PEOPLE HAVE SO LITTLE ALCOL D HYDROGENES THAT WHEN THEY INGEST ALCOHOL THEY GET VERY RED AND THEY JUST FEEL SICK SO IF YOUR SOMEBODY HAS A SIP OF ALCO YOU JUST FEEL HORRIBLE AT MAKES YOU FEEL NAXIOS CHANCES ARE YOU HAVE GENE VARIANCE THAT GREATEST SITUATION WE ARE NOT MAKING VERY MUCH ALCOHOL D HYDRAGENES YOU JUST SIMPLY CAN'T METABOLIZE ALCOL SO YOU JUST GET A RAPID BUILD UP OF THE TOXIC EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL THE SEETAL ALGAHIDE YOU'RE NOT CONVERTING IT INTO THOSE EMPTY CALORIES BUT IN CULTURES WHERE YOU HAVE A LOT OF GENETIC VARIANCE AND GENES EXPRESSED IN PEOPLE WHERE THEY HAVE A LOT OF ALCL D HYDRAGUNAES SURE THEY CAN DRINK MORE AND THEY'R CONVERTING MORE OF THAT ALCOL FROM ITS TOXIC FORM TO A NONTOXIC FORM AND YES OF COURSE YOU WILL OBSERVE MORE ALCOHOLISM IN THOSE COMMUNES BECAUSE THEY'RE DRINKING MORE BUT I DO ONE EMPHASIZE THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ARE PLAYING A STRONG ROLL THERE TOO BECUSE IF YOU CAN DRINK MORE YOU'RE LIKELY TO DRINK MOREIF YOU'RE SOMEBODY FEEL SICK IMMEDIATELY FROM DRINKING IT'S LIKELY THAT YOUR NOT ON ENGAGE IN ALCOHL CONSUMPTION ESPECIALLY IF THESE THINGS ARE GENETICALLY RELATET AND OF COURSE GENES AND CULTURE AND LOCATION IN THE WORLD TEND TO RUN TOGETHER SO DO YOU HAVE THE GENE FOR ALCOLISM WHER THERE ISN'T ONE SINGLE GENE CHANCES ARE IF YOU HAVE AN IMMEDIATE RELATIVE WHOSE A CHRONIC ABUSER OF ALCHOL OR SEVERAL RELATIVES TOR CHRONIC ABUSERS OF ALCOL WELL THAT'S GOING TO PREDISPOSE YOU TO BE AN ALCOHOLIC BUT SINCE YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH GENES YOU EXPRESS UNLESS YOU DO GENETIC TESTING IN THOSE THINGS ARE AVAILABLE BUT MOST PEOPLE AREN'T DOING THAT THIS ASSAY IF YOU WILL AN'S NOT AN ASSAY AS WE SAY AN ASSAY IS A TEST THAT YOU RUN IN THE LAMB OM TO DETERMIN SOMETHING AND IT'S NOT ONE THAT I RECOMMEND THAT YOU GO DRINK IN ORDER TO DO BUT IF YOU NOTICE THAT YOU OR SOMEBODY ALSE OF SOMEBODY WHO CAN DRINK A LOT THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT AND HAVE INCREASED ENERGY CAN JUST DRINK AND DRINK A DRINK AND ESPECIALLY IF THERE IS BLACKOUT EPISODES NOT REMEMBERING THINGS THE NEXT DAY DESPITE BEING ALERT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE NIGHT SO ON WELL THEN I WOULD BE VERY CONCERN THAT YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE A GENETIC VARIANT PREDISPOSING YOU TO ALCHOLISM THE OTHER THING THAT PREDISPOSES PEOPLE TO ABUSE OF ALCOHOL IS AGE PEOPLE WHO START DRINKING AT YOUNGER AGES ARE GREATLY PREDISPOSED TO DEVELOPING ALCOHL DEPENDENCE REGARDLESS OF YOUR FAMILY HISTORY OF ALCHOLISM CANSOME ON REPEAT THAT PEOPLE WHO START DRINKING YOUNGER ARE AT GREAT RISK FOR DEVELOPING ALCOHOLISM EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE ALCALISM IN THEIR FAMILY NOW OF COURSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU GROW UP IN A FAMILY OF DRINKERS IN ALCOHL IS EVERYWHERE AND ESPECIALYIF THERE'S PURE PRESSURE OR LACK OF OVERSITE THEN THERE'S GOING TO BE A HIGHER TENDENCY OR A HIGHER PROBABILITY I SHOULD SAY THAT YOU WILL START DRINKING AT A YOUNGER AGE HOWEVER EVEN PEOPLE THAT GROW UP NOWHERE NEAR THEIR RELATIVES IF THEY START DRINKING AT A YOUNG AGE SO FOR INSTANCE AT THIRTEEN OR YOUNGER OR FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN THERE'S A MUCH HIGHER PROBABILITY THAT THEY ARE GOING TO DEVELOP A LONG LASTING DEPENDENCE ON ALCOHOL PEOPLE WHO TAKE THEIR FIRST SIP OF ALCOHOL LATER FIFTEEN SIXTEEN OR ONE WOULD HOPE EVEN LATER I CAN SAY ONE WOULD HOPE CAUSE IN NOW OF THAT YOU KNOW AGE IN GENERATION WHERE YOU YOU KOW YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT A YOUNG PEOPLE DO AND OKOSCH IF THEY ONLY WOULD WAIT OR IF THEY ONLY WOULD OF STAYING SINCE WHAT HAPPENS OUT KNOW THERE SOME NARRL CIRCUIT FOR THAT THAT I CAN'T EXPLAIN YET BUT PEOPLE WHO FOR INSTANCE DRINK ONLY ONCE THEY REACH LEGAL AGE OF DRINKING WHICH IN THE YOU ASK I BELIEVE IN EVERY STAGE IS TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD IF THEY TAKE THEIR FIRST DRINK AT TWENTY ONE THE PROBABILITY THAT THEY'LL GO ON TO DEVELOP FULL BLOWN ALCHOL DEPENDENCS OR ALCHOL USE DISORDER AS IT'S CALLED A UD IS VERY LOW NOW SUPSET OF THEM WILL BECAUSE THEY AVE SUCH A STRONG GENETIC PREDISPOSITION OR MAY BE LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES CREATE A PATTERN IN WHICH THEY BECOME A CHRONIC DRINKER BUT I FOUND THIS VERY INTERESTING GENE'S MATTER BUT ALSO THE AGE IN WHICH SOMEBODY STARTS DRINKING REALLY MATTERS NOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S BECAUSE THEIR CHANGES IN NERAL CIRCUITRY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT DRINKING THAN MAKE PEOPLE WANT TO SEEK OUT MORE AND MORE ALCHOL OR WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S SOME OTHER EFFACT MAYBE IT'S A CHANGE IN HORMONES ET CETERA THAT PREDISPOSES THOSE YOUNG DRINKERS TO BECOME CHRONIC DRINKERS ARE EVEN FULL BLOWN ALCOHOLIC CERTAINLY DEVELOPING ALCOHL USED DISORDER THERE'S DEFINITION FOR THAT WE CAN TAL ABOUT IT IT INVOLVES THE AMOUNT OF DRINKING OVER A CERCERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME ET CETERA SO IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT DRINKING EARLY IN LIFE CREATES A PROPENSITY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALCOHOL USED DICORDER LATER IN LIFE AND WHILE THERE IS A GUNETIC COMPONENT TO DEVELOPING ALCHOL USED DICORDER I FIND IT VERY INTERESTING THAT IF PEOPLE WHO HAVE THOSE GENE VARIANCE DELAY THEREON SET OF DRINKING WELL THEN THE PROBABILITY THAT THEY'LL DEVELOP FULL BLOWN ALCOL USED DISORDER DROPS AS WELL SO AGAIN ITS GENE'S END ENVIRONMENTS NOT IN ITHER OR AND THERE'S NO SINGLE JENE FOR ALCOHOLISM WELL I PROMISE YOU I WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE DOCUMENTED POSITIVE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ALTHOUGH THEY ARE VERY FEW AND FAR BETWEEN THEY DO EXIST BUT BEFORE I DO THAT I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T EMPHASIZE SOME MORE OF THE TERRIBLE THINGS THAT ALCOHOL DOES IN THE WAY THAT IT DOES IT AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ENJOY ALCOHOL I AGAN I I REALLY LIKE TO SAY A FEU'L GUILTY ABOUT TELLING YOU THIS BECAUSE I KNOW HOW MUCH SOME PEOPLE ENJOY A GOOD DRINK EVERY ONCE NOWHIL AND I SAY GOOD DRINK BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE DO LIKE THE TASTE OF ALCOL I SUPPOSE I LUCKED OUT AND THAT I DON'T REALLY LIKE THE TASTE OF ALCOL ME JUST PUTS ME TO SLEEP BUT I KNOW THAT PEOPLE DO ENJOY IT AND I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THERE IS ZERO EVIDENCE THAT YOU DON'T PROVIDED SOMEBODY IS OF DRINKING AGE CERTAINLY NOT IN THE STAGE OF BRAIN DEVELOPMENT THAT HAVING ONE DRINK OR TWO DRINKS EVERY NOW AND AGAIN MEANING EVERY THREE OR FOUR WEEKS OR ONCE A MONTH THAT IS NOT GOING TO CAUSE MAJOR HEALTH CONCERNS OR MAJOR HEALTH ISSUES FOR MOST PEOPLE I SUPPOSE OF YOU HAVE ZERO OR VERY LITTLE ALCOLDY HYDROGENES IT MIGH MAKE YOU FEEL SICK BUT THEN YOUR NOT PROBABLY NOT THE KIND OF PERSON THAT'S GOING TO BE DRINKING AT ALL SO AGAIN IF YOU ENJOI ALCOL DRINKS I'M NOT TRYING TO M TAKE THEM AWAY FROM YOU OT BY ANY MEANS BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT DRINKING DOES IF YOUARE CONSUMING IT IN THIS KIND OF TYPICAL CHRONIC PATTERN AS WE CAN NOW REFER TO IT WHICH IS THAT ONE OR TWO AND NIGHT OR A FEW STACKED UP ON FRIDAY AND MAY BE THREE OR FOUR ON SATURDAY THIS KIND OF PATTERN OF DRINKING WHICH IS QUITE COMMON AND ONE OF THE MORE SERIOUS EFFECTS THAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT IS THE IMPACT ON THE SO CALL GUT BRAIN ACISE ORFOR ACHE OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION THE GUT LIVER BRAIN ACIS I DON'T THINK THE GUT LIVER BRAIN ACIS HAS EVER BEEN DISCUSSED ON THIS PODCAST MAYBE ANY PODCAST ALTHOUGH THE MOMENT I SAY THAT I'MG NO THE THE GUT LIVER BRAIN AXIS PEOPLE ARE GON TO COME AFTER ME WITH I SUPPOSED GUT LIVE R BRAIN AND BRAINS IN ANY EVENT YOU HAVE A BRAIN YOU HAVE A GUT THAT GOT RUNS FROM YOUR THROAT DOWN TO THE END OF YOUR INTESTINE YOU'RE GOT AND YOUR BRAIN COMMUNICATE BY WAY OF NERVE CELLS NORONS AND NERVE CONNECTIONS THE VAGUEST NERVE IN PARTICULAR AND BY WAY OF CHEMICAL SIGNALING YOU'RE GOT ALSO COMMUNICATES BY WAY OF CHEMICAL SIGNALLING AND BELIEVE OR NOT BY WAY OF NERL SIGNALLING TO TO YOUR LIVER AND AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THE LIVER IS THE FIRST SIGT IN WHICH ALCOHOL IS BROKEN DOWN OR METABOLIZED INTO ITS COMPONENT PARTS THE LIVER IS ALSO COMMUNICATING WITH THE BRAIN THROUGH CHEMICAL SIGNALING AND NERAL SIGNALLING SO WE HAVE THE GOT LIVER BRAIN AXIS AND WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT PEOPLE WHO INJEST ALCOHOL AT ANY AMOUNT AR INDUCING A DESERRUPTION IN THE SO CLE GOT MICROBIOM THE TRILLIANS OF LITTLE MICROBACTERIA THAT TAKE RESIDENT IN YOUR GUT IN THAT LIVE INSIDE YOU ALL THE TIME AND THET HELP SUPPORT YOUR MUNE SYSTEM AND THAT LITERALLY SIGNAL BY WAY OF ELECTRICAL SIGNALS AND CHEMICAL SIGNALS TO YOUR BRAIN TO INCREASE THE RELEASE OF THINGS LIKE CERATONAN AND DOPOMINE THAND REGULATE YOUR MOOD GENERALLY IN POSITIVE WAYS WHAT ALCOLL REALLY DISERUPTS THOSE BACTERIA THIS SHOULD COME IS NO SURPRISE AND EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND IT'S WELL KNOWN IF YOU WANTED YOU ITSTERILIZE SOMETHING YO I KILL THE BACTERIA YOU POUR ALCHOLL ON IT AND I CAN REMEMBER SCRAPING MY UM MYSELL FOR CUTTING MYCELF I WAS ALWAYS INDURE MYSELF WHEN I WAS A KID AND YOU KNOW THE MOMENT THEY TAKE OUT THE PEROXIDE ON THE COW BOY HERE IT COMES BUT IT IS NO PEROXIDE AROUND AND YOU'VE GOT A WOUND THER I NEAN TO CLEAN IT OUT YET THEY THEY'LL USE ALCOLL WHICH I DO NOT RECOMMEND BY THE WY THAT'S ONE OF THE HARSHEST WAYS TO CLEAN A WOUND BUT FOR CENTURIES THOUSANDS OF YEARS REALLY ALCALLS HAS BEEN USED IN ORDER TO CLEAN THINGS AND KILL BACTERIA SO ALCOLL KILLS BACTERIA AND IT IS INDISCRIMINATE WITH RESPECT TO WHICH BACTERIA IT KILLS SO WHEN WE INJEST ALCOL AND GOES INTO OUR GUT IT KILLS HA LOT OF THE HEALTHY GUT MICROBIODA AT THE SAME TIME THE METABOLISM OF ALCHOLL IN THE LIVER WHICH YOU NOW UNDERSTAND THAT PATHWAY INVOLVING AN IDEA SEEDL A SEETL ALDAHIDE AND ASCITATE THAT PATHWAY IS PRO INFLAMMATORY SO IT'S INCREASING THE RELEASE OF INFLAMMATORY SIHTE OF KINDS THINGS LIKE IEL SIX ET CETERA TO MENECROSIS FACTOR ALPHA IF YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM WE DIDN'N EPISODE ALL ABOUT THE IMUNE SYSTEM YOU CAN FIND THAT YOU'VEREEN LABDOT COMME TEACH OU ALL THE BASICS OF WHAT OUR SIDE A KINDS WHAT OUR MAST SELLS ET CETERA IN ANY EVENT ALL THESE PRO INFLAMMATORY MOLECULES THOSE ARE BEING RELEASED YOU'VE NOW GOT DESRUPTION OF THE GUT MICROBIODA AS A CONSEQUENCE THE LINING OF THE GUT IS DESTERRUPTED AND YOU DEVELOP AT LEAST TRANSIENTLY LEEKY GUT THAT IS BACTERIA THAT EXIST IN THE GUT WHICH ARE BAD BACTERIA CAN NOW PASS OUT OF THE GUT INTO THE BLOODSTREAMS SO YOU'VE GOT A TO HIT CONOMODEL RE IN BILGY WE TALK ABOUT TWO HIPMODELS THAT IT'S KIND OF A ONE PLUS ONE EQUALS FOR AND IT'S GENERALLY WHEN YOU HEAR TOO HIT IT'S NOT A GOOD THING SO YOU'VE GOT BAD BACTERIA FROM PARTIALLY BROKEN DOWN FOOD MOVING OUT OF THE GUOT THE GOOD BACTERIIN THE GUT HAVE BEEN KILLED YOU MIGHT SAY WISINLY ALCOHOL KILL THE BAD BACTERIA IN THE GUT WELL THE BAD BACTERIA THAT ARE FROM PARTIALLY DIGESTED FOOD OFTENTIMES ESCAPE THE GUT BEFORE THE ALCOHOL CAN DESRUPT THEM AND SO NOW YOU'VE GOT LEAKS IN THE GUT WOLL YOU'VE GOT THE RELEAS OF THIS BAD BACTERIA YOU'VE GOT INFLAMMATORY SIDE OF KINDS AND OTHER THINGS BEING RELEASED FROM THE LIVER AND THEY ARE ABLE TO GET INTO THE BRAIN THROUGH NER WHAT'S CALLED A NEUROMYAN SIGNALLING AND WHAT'S REALLY BAZAARE IN TERMS OF THE WAY THAT THIS MANIFESTS IN THE BRAIN I MEAN IT'S NOT THE WAY I WOULD HAVE DONE IT BUT THEN AGAIN AS I ALWAYS SAY I WASN'T CONSULTED AT THE DESIGN PHASE AND ANYONE SAYS THEY DID YOU SHOULD BE VERY SCEPTICAL OF THEM THE NETEFFECT OF THIS IS ACTUALLY TO DISERRUPT THE NURAL CIRCUITS THAT CONTROL REGULATION OF ALCOHOLIN TAKE AND THE NET EFFECT OF THAT IS INCREASED ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION SO THIS IS JUST TERRIBLE RIGHT UM INTO YOURD TAKE IN SOMETHING THAT DESRUPTS TO SYSTEMS THE GUT MICROBIOTA AND IT DESTRUPTS IN TWO WAYS IT'S KILLING THE GOOD GUT MICROBIOTA AND IT'S ALLOWING THE BAD BACTERIA TO MOVE FROM THE GOT INTO THE BLOODSTREAM YOU'VE ALSO GOT PROINFLAMMATORY SIDE OF KINDS COMING FROM THE LIVER AND THOSE CONVERGE OR ARRIVE IN THE BRAIN AND CRATE A SYSTEM IN WHICH THE NURAL CIRCUITS CAUSE MORE DRINKING THAT'S A BAD SITUATION AND THIS IS WHY PEOPLE WHO DRINK REGULARLY EVEN IF IT'S NOT A TON OF ALCOHOL AGAIN OF THE SORTS OF PATTERNS OF DRINK OUT TALKED ABOUT BEFORE AND CERTAINLY FOR THOSE THAT ARE CHRONIC HEAVY DRINKERS WHAT YOU END UP WITH AS A SITUATION IN WHICH YOU HAVE INFLAMMATION IN MULTILE PLACES IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND THE DESIRE TO DRINK EVEN MORE AND TO FURTHER EXACERBATE THAT INFLAMMATION AND THE GUT LEEKY NESS SO THIS IS BASICALY A TERRIBLE CYNARIO FOR THE GUT LIVER BRAIN AXIS AND IT'S ESPECIALLY PREVALENT AN SO CALED ALCOHOL USED DICEORDER AGAIN PEOPLE THERE INJESTING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWELVE AND TWENTY FOUR DRINKS PER WEEK FOR THOSE ORE YOU THAT ARE INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE GUT LIVER BRAIN AXIS AND IN PARTICULAR ALCHOL USEDICEORDER A'LL PROVIDE A LINK IN THE SHOW NOTE CAPTIONS ANDTHERE'S WONDERFUL REVIEW ON THIS THE DETAILS THAT BUT ON THE POSITIVE SIDE IT POINTS TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT AT LEAST SOME AGAIN AT LEAST SOME OF THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF ALCOL CONSUMPTION WHETHER NOT YOU'RE SOMEBODY USE CURRENTLY INJESTING ALCOHOL OR WHO USED TO INJEST ALCHOLN IS TRYING TO THO CALLED REPAIR THESE SYSTEMS OF THE BRAIN AND BODY WHETHER NOT REPLENISHING THE GUT MICROBIOTA IS GOING T BE BENEFICIAL AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE WAIGS TO DO THAT AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S AT LEAST SOME PROMISE FOR THE ABILITY FOR THE SYSTEM TO REPAIR ITSELF HOW DOES ONE DO THAT WHEAVE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT THIS ON THE PODCAST BUT STUDY'S GONE BY CALLIGUES OF MINE AT STAMFOR JUST IN SONOBERG WHO'S BEEN ON THIS PODCAST AS A GUEST IN AMAZING EPISODE ALL ABOUT THE GUT MICROBIOM AND IS CALLABO REATER CRISGARNER ALSO AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE HAVE EXPLORED NOT ALCHOLISM BUT WHAT ARE WAYS TO IMPROVE THE GOT MICROBYOTA AND PARTICULAR TO REDUCE THE PRODUCTION OF INFLAMMATORY SITE OF KINES AND TO A JUST WHAT'S ALLED THE INFLAMMATOME YOUV HEARD OF THE GENOME AND THE PRODEOME ET CETERA WHILE THE INFLAMMATOME IS THE TOTAL ARRAY OR AT LEAST THE NEAR TOTAL ARRAY OF GENES AND PROTINES THAT CONTROL INFLAMMATION HOW CAN YOU REDUCE INFLAMMATION AND MAKE THAT IMFLAMMATOME HEALTHIER WELL THEY'VE SHOWN THAT TWO TO FOUR SERVINGS OF FERMENTED FOODS PER DAY AND HERE I'M NOT REFERRING TO FERMENTED ALCOL AND I'M AT LOW SUGAR FERMENTED FOODS OF THINGS LIKE KIMCHEI SAUR CRAUT AM NATO FOR THE FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT LIKE JAPANESE FOOD OM THERE ARE OTHERS I KNOW ON THINGS LIKE KEEFER THINGS LIKE A YOGERTS HAVE A LOT OF ACT OF BACTERIA AGAIN LOW SUGAR VARIETIES OF ALL THESE THINGS THOSE ARE TERRIFIC AT REDUCING INFLAMMATORY MARKERS AND AT IMPROVING THE GOT MICROBIOM ONE COULD IMAGINE THAT EITHER INOCULATING ONESELF FROM SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ALTHOUGH I'D PREFER THAT PEOPLE JUST NOT DRINK ALCOLCHRONICALLY FRANKLY OR IF SOMEBODY'S TRYING TO REPAIR THEY'RE GOT MICROBYOM BECAUSE THEY INJESTED A LOT OF ALCOHOL AR BECAUE THEY HAD A LOT OF TESE INFLAMMATORY SID O KINDS FOR MANY YEARS ARE EVEN A SHORT PERIOD O TIME REGULAR INGESTION OF TWO TO FOUR SERVINGS OF THESE FERMENTED FOODS CAN BE UM QUITE BENEFICIAL ONE MAKE IT CLEAR THAT HAS NOT BEEN EXAMINED SPECIFICALLY IN THE CONTACT OF ALCOLL USED DICORDER BUT BECAUSE A HUGE COMPONENT OF THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF ALCOL USE DISORDER ARE BASED IN THIS GOT LIVER BRAIN ACCESS AND DESTRUPTION THE GOTMICROBIOM IN THE ININFLAMMATORY SIDE A KINDS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THINGS THAT ARE WELL ESTABLISHED TO IMPROVE INFLAMMATION STATUS ANOTHERWORDS REDUCE INFLAMMATION SUCH AS INJESTING TWO TO FOR SERVINGS OF THOUGH SUGAR FERMENTED FOODS PER DAY MAKE SENSE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO REPAIR OR REPLENISH THE SYSTEM ONE COLD ALSO IMAGINE TAKING PROBIATICS OR PREBIATICS CERTAINLY THAT WOULD WORK AS WELL ALTHOUGH I'VE SORT OF FAVORED THE DISCUSSION ROUND FERMENTED FOODS AND REPLENISHMENT OF THE GOT MICROBIOM MOSTLY BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE STUDIES THAT HAVE EXAMINED THAT INHUMANS AN BECAUSE OF THE DIRECT RELATIONSHIP THAT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED BETWEEN DOING THAT AND REDUCING NEGATIVE MARKERS WITHIN THE INFLAMATOM AND I SHOULD MENTION ALONG THE LINES OF REPAIR AND RECOVERY I PUT OUT A QUESTION ON TWITTER THE OTHER DAY I SAID WHAT YOU WANTO KNOW ABOUT ALCOHOL MORE THAN A THOUSAND QUESTIONS AND TAKE SOME MORE OF THOSE QUESTIONS LILE LATER IN THE EPISODE BUT ONE OF THINGS I NOTICE IS THAT MANY OF THE QUESTIONS HUNDREDS IN FACT RELATED TO THE QUESTION OF WELL IF I DRANK A LOT PREVIOUSLY AM I DOOMED CAN I REVERSE THE NEGATIVE OF FACTS OR I MUN I'M TRYING TO DRINK LASS AND I'M TRYING TO IMPROVE MY HEALTH AS I AS I DO THAT WHAT SHOULD I DO WILL CERTAINLY AM FOCUSSING A BIT ON THE OT MICROBYOME OUGHT TO BE USEFUL THE OTHER THING I SHOULD MENTION IS AS PEOPLE WEAN THEMSELVES OFF ALCOL EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT FULL BLOWN AL OHOLICS AR HAVE ALCALL YOUSE DISORDER  SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THAT INCREASE IN CORTIS ALL THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THAT LEADS TO LOWER STRESS THRESHOLD AND GREATER FEELINGS OF ANXIETY IN STRESS THAT'S GOING TO BE PRESENT IN ITS CON IT TAKE SOME TIME TO DISSIPATE SO FOR SOME PEOPLE HIT MIGHT EVEN JUST BE HELPFUL TO REALIZE THAT AS YOU TRY AND WEAN YOURSELF OFF ALCOLLAR MAY BE EVEN GO CALL TURKEY THAT INCREASED ANXIETY AND FEELINGS OF STRESS SHOULD BE EXPECTED AND IN THAT CASE I WOULD POINT YOU TO AN EPISODE THAT WE DID ON MASTER STRESS YOU FIND THAT AGAIN AT HUVERMAN LADOK COLMITS GOT ATON OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTATION BASE EXERCISE BASE I SUPPOSE EXERCISES BEHAVIOR BUT A LOT OF TOOLS YOU CAN NAVIGATE TO THOSE EASILY BECAUSE WE HAVE TIMESTAMPSYING GO RIGHT TO THE TOPIC OF INTERESTS THOSE TOOLS ARE GONG TO BE VERY USEFUL IN TRYING TO CLAMP OR CONTROL YOUR STRESS AND THE POINT HERE IS JUST THAT SOME INCREASE IN STRESS SHOULD BE EXPECTED AND IT SHOULD BE EXPECTED BECAUSE OF THAT INCREASE IN CORTISALL THAT CCURSE WITH EVEN LOW LEVEL CONSUMPTION YET CHRONIC ALCOLL CONSUMPTION NOW I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT A FAIRLY COMMON PHENOMENON WHICH IS POST ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION MALAZ ALSO REFERRED TO AS HANG OVER HANG OVER IS A CONSTELLATION OF A FACTS RANGING FROM HEADACHE TO NAUSIA TO WHAT SOMETIMES CALL THE HANXIETY WHICH IS ANXIETY THAT FOLLOWS A DAY OF DRINKING HANXIETY I THINK WE CAN UNDERSTAND PHYSIOLOGICALLY IF WE THINK ABOUT THAT PROCESS OF ALCOHOL IN TAKE INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF CORTISALL AND THE RASIOE OF CORTISAL TO SOME OTHER STRESS HORMONES THAT WELL EXPLAINS WHY SOME PEOPLE WAKE UP THE DAY AFTER OR EVEN THE DAY THE DAY AFTER A NIGHT DRINKING AND FEEL ANXIOUS AND NOT WELL AND STRESS FOR REASONS THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND SO IF YOUARE SOMEBODY WHO EXPERIENCES HANXIETY THEN AGAIN I REFER YOU TO THE MASTER STRESS EPISODE THAT WE PUT OUT O SOMETIME AGO WHEN YU CAN FIND THAT HUVERMN LABDOT CALM TOOLS TO DEAL WITH ANXIETY TOOLS TO DEAL WITH STRESS RANGING AGAIN FROM BEHAVIORAL TO NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENT BASE ET CETERA THAT OF COURSE IS NOT JUSTIFICATION FOR GOING OUT AND DRINKING SO MUCH THAT YOU GET ANXIETY INDUCED HANG OVER BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE EXPERIENCING POST ALCOLL CONSUMPTION ANXIETY AS IT WERE THAT COULD BE A USEFUL RESOURCE BECAUSE I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT ANY ONE EXPERIENCING A UNCOMFORTABLE MOUNTS OF ANXIETY AND THERE ARE GREAT TOOLS IN RESOURCES FOR THAT NOW THE OTHER ASPECTS OF HANG OVER SUCH AS THE STOMACH ACHE OR HEADACHE OR FEELINGS OF MALAIZ OR FOGGINESS THOSE CAN BE RELATED TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND PROBABLY ARE RELATED TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS FIRST OF ALL THE SLEEP THAT ONE GETS AFTER EVEN JUST ONE YES EVEN JUST ONE GLASS OF WINE OR A BEER IS NOT THE SAME SLEEP THAT YOU GET WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ALCOLL CIRCULATING IN YOUR SYSTEM AND NOT TRYING TO BE A DOWNER HERE BUT THIS WAS DISCUSSED IN THE HUVRAN LABPODCAST EPISODE WE RE I HAD DOCTOR MATTHEW WALKER FROM YOU SEE BURKLY ON AND COURSE DOCTOR WALKER IS A WORLD EXPERT IN SLEEP RUNS ONE OF THE PRE EMINENT LABORATORIES STUDING SLEEP IN ITS EFFECTS WROTE THE INCREDIBLE BOOK WHY WE SLEEP AND SO ON DOCTOR WALKER TOLD ME AND CERTAINLY IS SUPPORTED BY LOTS AND LOTS OF QUALITY PEREVIEWED STUDIES IN ANIMALS AND IN HUMANS THAT WHEN ALCALL IS PRESENT AND THE BRAIN AND BLOODSTREAM THAT THE ARCHITECTURE OF SLEEP IS DESTRUPTED SLOW WAVE SLEEP DEEP SLEEP AND RAPIDIE MOVEMENT SLEEP ALL OF WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR GETTING RESTORTID NIGHT SLEEP AR ALL DISTRUPTED SO FOR THOSE VIEW THAT ARE DRINKING A GLASS OR TO OF WINE OR HAVING A A HARD LIQUOR DRINK OR A BEER IN ORDER TO FALL A SLEEP THE SLEEP YOU'R GETTING IS SIMPLY NOT HIGH QUALITIES SLEEP OR CERTAINLY NOT AS HIGH QUALITIES THE SLEEP YOU BE GETTING IF YOU DID NOT HAVE ALCALL ON YOUR SYSTEM COURSE WHEN WE'RE TALKING BOUT HANG OVER WERE TALKING GENERALLY ABOUT THE CONSUMPTION OF MORE THAN JUST ONE OR TWO DRINKS COURSE FOR SOME PEOPLE ONE OR TWO DRINKS AS PROBABLY SUFFICIENT TO INDUCE HANG OVER BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE IT'S GOING TO BE HAVING THREE OR FOUR EXCEEDING THAT THEIRE TYPICAL LIMIT AS IT'S CALLED AGAN NOT THE LEGAL LIMIT THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER BUSINESS BUT WHEN ONE INJESTS TOO MUCH ALKOHOL FOR THEM ONE OF THE REASONS THEY FEEL TERRIBLE THE NEXT DAY IS BECAUSE THEIR SLEEP IS IN REALLY GOOD SLEEP IN FACT IT'S NOT EVEN SLEEP ITS OFTEN CONSIDERED SEUDO SLEEP EAR LEAST THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED IN THE SLEEP SCIENCE FIELD BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE IN KIND OF A LOW LEVEL HYPNOTIC KIND OF TRANCE IS NOT REAL SLEEP THEIR MULTIPLE BOUTS OF WAKING UP THEY MAY NOT EVEN REALIZE THEIR WAKING UP MULTIPLE TIMES O GASO THERE'S THE SLEEP IN DUCE EFFECTS THEN THERE ARE THE DISRUPTED GOT MICROBIUM EFFECTS SOME OF WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER SO NOW YOU UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISM OF ALCALL DESTROYING GOOD HEALTHY GOT MICROBIOTA WHICH THEN LEADS THE LEEKY GOTEN THINGS OF THAT SORT BUT ONE COULD IMAGIN AGAIN COULD IMAGINE AND THERE SOME EVIDENT STARTING TO SUPPORT THIS THAT AGAIN IN JESTING LOSUGAR FERMENTED FOODS ORE MAY BE IN EBIOTIC OR PROBOD TO SUPPORT THE GUTMICROBIUM MIGHT ASSIST IN SOME OF THE GUT RELATED MALAYS ASSOCIATED WITH HANG OVER OTHER WORDS GET THOSE GOT MICROBIOTA HEALTHY AGAIN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE OR MAYBEVEN BEFORE YOU DRINK HAVE THOSE GOT MICROBY OTO HEALTHY I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU DO THAT THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD BE DOING SOMETHING TO SUPPORT THEIR GOTMICROBYUM WHETHER NOT THE INGESTION OF LOSUGAR FORMENTED FOODS DAILY OR AT LEAST ON A REGULAR BASIS OR INGESTION OF PROBIOTIC OR PREBIOTIC THE GOTMICROBIUM IS SO IMPORTANT FOR SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS IN TERMS OF HANG OVER AND HEAD ACHE WE KNOW THAT THAT'S CAUSED BY VEZO CONSTRICTION THE CONSTRICTION OF BLOOD VESSELS THAT TENDS TO OCCUR AS A REBOUND AFTER NIGHT OF DRINKING ALCALL CAN ACT AS OF VAZO DILATOR CAN DILATE THE BLOOD VESSELS PART OF THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASE IN SO CALLED PARIS SYMPATHETIC TONE WE HAVE AN AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IT'S GOT A SYMPATHETIC COMPONENT THESE ARE NURONS THAT MAKE US MORE LURT AND IF THE'RE VERY ACTIVE THEY MAKE US VERY STRESS THREIS ALSO THE PARO SYMPATHETIC ASPECT OF THE AUT ONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THIS IS ALL JUST FANCY GEEKS SPEAK FOR THE PARTS OF YOUR BRAIN AND BODY THE NERVE CELLS THAT MAKE YOU VERY RELAXED WHEN YOUR VERY RELAXED THERETENDS TO BE VAZO DILATION IT ALLOWS FOR MORE MOVEMENT TOF BLOOD AND OTHER THINGS THROUGH THE BLOOD STREAM AND ALCALL TENS INDUCE SOME VAZO DILATION AT LEAST IN SOME OF THE CAPALLARY BEDS AND THEN WHEN THE ALCOLL WARES OFF THERE IS A VASO CONSTRICTION AND PEOPLE GET BRUTAL HEADACHES THAT'S WHY SOME PEOPLE WILL TAKE ASPERAN OR TILE AN ALL OR ADVILLE OR THINGS LIKE THAT THIS OR OF NON STEROID ANTIN FLAMMATORIES I SHOULD MENTION THERE IS A LOT OF LITERATURE COMING OUT THAT SOME OF THESE NON STEROID ANTIN FLAMMATORY DRUGS ARE NOT GOOD FOR US FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REASONS AND WAY THEY IMPACT DELIVER THE WAY THEY IMPACT THE IMUNE SYSTEM AND NO SURPRISE THE WAY THEY IMPACT THE GUP MYCROBYOM SI'M NOT ONE TO TELL YOU WHAT MEDICATIONS TO TAKE OR NOT TAKE BUT YOU CERTANLY WOULD WANT TO DO A A QUICK WEB SEARCH OF EFFECTS OF NONSTERROID A ANTIME FLAMMATORIES OM AN ASPERN BEFORE YOU START TAKING THOSE OR STOP TAKING THOSE FOR THAT MATTER GENERALLY THEY WILL ALLEVIATE HEADACHE BUT THEY CAN OFTEN HAVE OTHER ISSUES INCLUDING LIVER ISSUES AND KEEPING MIND THE NIGHT AFTER DRINKING YOUR LIVER IS ALREADY TAKIN A BEATING BECAUSE OF THE NEED OF THE LIVER TO CONVERT ALCOHOL FROM A SEE ALOWL THE HIDE IMTACITATE WHICH IS NOW PATHWAY THAT YOU WELL UNDERSTAND SO 'M NOT CERTAIN AND IN FACT I BELIEVE IT'S NOT THE GRAYEST IDEA TO BURDIN YOUR LIVER FURTHER THROUGH THE USE OF THINGS OM THAT ARE GOING TO CAUSE IT TO HAVE TO WORK HARDER AND METABOLIZE THINGS IF THE GOAL IS SIMPLY TO ALLEVIATE A HEADACHE THERE'S A LOT OF KIND OF LORE A OLD SCHOOL LORE ABOUT HOW TO RELIEVE A HANG OVER WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT HOW EATING FOOD WON'T DO THAT BUT EATING FOOD WILL PREVENT THE RAPID ABSORBTION OF EVEN MORE ALCOLL INTO THE BLOOD STREAM THERE'S THE LORE THAT ONE SHOULD SIMPLY INJEST MORE ALCOHL WHAT TERRIBLE ADVICE THAT IS THAT'S JUST IN A DELAY AND EVEN WORSE HANG OVER HOWEVER I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T SAY THAT THE REASON THAT THAT MITH CAME TO BE OR THAT I SHOULD SAY THAT TRUTH CAME TO BE BECAUSE INDEED INJESTING MORE ALCOHL WILL ALLEVIATE A HANG OVER BUT THEN A WORSE HANG OVER WILL SHOW UP TH REASON THAT CAME TO BE IS BECAUSE INJESTION MORE ALCOL WILL CAUSE THOSE CONSTRICTED VESSELS THEY ARE GIVING T A HEADACHE TO DILATE AGAIN BUT OF COURSE INJESTING MORE ALCOL TO RELIEVE A HANG OVER SIMPLY A BAD IDEA JUST DON'T DO IT I THINK THES IS CALLED THE HAIR OF THE DOG APPROACH MAY BE SOME ONE CAN PUT IN THE SHOWN OUT CAPTIONS ON YOU TO WHY IT'S CLLED THE HAIR OF THE DOG I CAN COME UP WITH A FEW IDEAS BUT O THEY'RE NOT THEY GONG TO BE VERY GOOD ONES AND I'M SOME OF THEM D PROBABLY EN BE OUTRIGHT RIDICULOUS SO DO NOT INJEST MORE ALCOHOL SIMPLY TO TRY AND RECOVER FROM I HANG OVER I KNOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TRIED THAT ONE BEFORE BUT THAT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA NOW ONE THING THAT YOU'LL ALSO HERE OUT THERE IS THAT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE FOR ITSTINS TAKING A COLD SHOWER MIGHT RELIEVE HANG OVER I FIND THIS ONE PARTICULARLY INTERESTING BECAUSE WE'VE DONE EPISODES ON THE BENEFITS OF DELIVERATE COLD EXPOSURE WE HAVE AN ENTIRE EPISODE O BOUT THAT YOU FIND IT AGAIN HUVRAN LABDAK COME THERE DIRECT LINGS TO SOME OF THE TOOLS RELATES T O DELIERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND WE HAVE AN AN EN TIRE NEWSLETTER ON DELIBERATE COLLD EXPOSURE PROTOCHOLS YOU CAN FIND ON HUVERAN LABDACONGOD OR NURL NETWORK NEWS LETTER O THESE THOSE OF YOU THER INTERSTINT ICE BAS IN COLD SHOWERS AND WAIGHS TO LEVERAGE THOSE YOU CAN FIND THAT THERE WHAT YOU WON'T FIND THERE IS A DESCRIPTION OF HOW TO USE DELIBERATE COLLED EXPOSURE FOR SAKE OF TREATING HANG OVER BUT HERE I WENT INTO THE LICHRAND IE FOUND SOMETHING KIND OF INTERESTING THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT INCREASING LEVELS OF EPINEPHRAN IN THE BLOOD STREAM CAN ACTUALLY HELP WITH ALCOHOL CLEARANCE THAT WAS VERY SURPRISING TO ME AND I WANT TO POINT OUT THIS IS NOT A LARGE AND ROBUST LITERATURE BUT THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE POINTING THE FACT THAT WHEN LEVELS OF EPINEFR AND A DRENALINE ARE RAISED IN THE BRAIN AND BLOOD STREAM THAT SOME OF THE COMPONENTS OF ALCOL METABOLISM CAN BE ACCELERATED AND SOME OF THE ENEBRIATING EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL CAN BE REDUCED SO MAYBE THIS OLD SCHOOL LORE OF TAKING A COLD SHOWER ACTUALLY HAS SOMETHING TO IT SO IN THINKING ABOUT THE USE OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE EFFECTS OF HANG OVER OR TO MORE RAPIDLY CLEAR ALCOHOL FROM THE BRAIN AND BLOODSTREAM I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE YOUR SAFETY THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO UNDERSTAND THAT ALCOHOL LOWERS COR BODY TEMPERATURE I CAN MAKE PEOPLE SLIGHTLY HYPO THERMIC ITS CAN A DROPCORBODY TEMPERATURE SO IF YOU WERE ENEBRIATED AND YOU WENT AND GOT INTO A BODY OF WATER RITE A POOL OR A LAKE OR SOMETHING FIRST OF ALL THAT'S EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO DO WHILE YOUR INEBRIATED  PEOPLE DROWN ALL THE TIME PEOPLE DROWN THEY DIE AS A CONSEQUENCE O DONG THAT SO PLEASE DON'T TO THAT BUT ALSO I IT'S VERY COLD WATER YOUR CORBODY TEMPRATURES GOING O DROP EVEN FURTHER NOW IF YOU'VE HEARD THE EPISODES THAT HAVE DONE ON DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE PREVIOUSLY I'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW NORMALLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT IN JUSTING ALCOL THEY GET INTO AN ICE BATHROCOL SHOWER AND THEIR BODY TEMPERATURE INITIALLY DIPS BUT THEN IT REBOUNDS AND INCREASES THAT'S A PROCESS THAT'S GOING TO ACCUR WHEN PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE ALCOHL IN THEIR SYSTEM WHEN YOU HAVE ALCOL IN YOUR SYSTEM ONE OF THE REASONS THAT YOU BECOME HYPOTHERMIC IS BECAUSE THERE'S A DESRUPTION IN THOSE HYPOTHALAMIC BRAINAIRIES IN PARTICULAR THE BRAINAIRY CALL THE MEDIAL PREOPTIC AREA THAT REGULATES CORBODY TEMPERATURE SO IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT ALCOHOL MAKES YOU COLD ITS THAT ALCOHOL DESRUPTS THE CENTRAL COMMAND CENTERS OF THE BRAIN THAT CONTROL TEMPERATURE REGULATION AND THAT LEADS YOU TO BE SLIGHTLY HYPOTHERMIC SO IF YOU THEN GO GET INTO A VERY COLD LAKE ORE YOU GET INTO EVEN A COLD SHOWER OR AN ICE BATH THERE'S THE POSSIBILITY OF YOU GOING VERY VERY FAR DOWN THE LATTER INTO VERY HYPOTHERMIC TERRITORY AND THAT CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS NOW IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH HANG OVER WHEN THE ALCOHL HAS BEEN LARGELY CLEARED FROM YOUR SYSTEM WELL THAT'S WHERE SOME OF THIS ANOLD LORE COMBINES WITH SOME OF THE MODERN SCIENCE AND SAYS WELL IF YOU CAN SPIKE A DRENALINE AND CERTAINLY GETTING INTO AN ICE BATH ORE GETTING INTO A COLD SHOWER OR ANY KIND OF COLD BODY OF WATER PROVIDED YOU CAN DO THAT SAFELY THAT WILL SHARPLY INCREASE YOUR DRENALINE AND ND I SHOULD SAY YOUR DOPOMING THAT'S BEEN SHOWN AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS ON THE PODCATS BEFORE YOU GET THESE LONG EXTENDED INCREASES SEVERAL HOURS OF INCREASES IN DOPOMING FROM DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IT'S WELL DOCUMENT IN HUMANS BY THE WAY SO ONE COULD IMAGINE USING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AS A WAY TO EXCELERATE THE RECOVERY FROM HANG OVER PROVIDED THAT'S DONE SAFELY I THINK O THERE'S NO REASON TO NOT EXPLORE THAT AND IF YOUR WONDER WHAT SAFELY IS AND WHAT TEMPERATURES TO USE PLEASE CHECK OUT THE EPISODE ON DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE COLD SHOWERS THEREFORE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE ONE WAY TO AT LEASE PARTIALLY RELIEVE HANG OVER CERTAINLY THE SCIENCE FROM VARIOUS PLACES IN THE LITERATURE CONVERGE TO SAY THAT BUT AGAIN BE CAREFUL PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BE CAREFUL NOT TO GET INTO COLD WATER WHEN YOU ARE INEBRIATED IT'S ABSOLUTELY DANGEROUS FOR ALL THE OBVIOUS REASONS AND IT'S DANGEROUS ALSO FOR THE NON OBVIOUS REASONS NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS THE DRAMATIC DECREASES IN CORBODY TEMPERATURE THAT COAN MAKE YOU DANGEROUSLY HYPOTHERMIC NOW HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT USING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE TO EXCELERATE  RECOVERY FROM HANG OVER WELL THERE I WOULD LOOK TO THE  KIND OF STANDARD PROTOCALS OF YOU KNOW ONE TO THREE MINUTES FROM AVIAN SIX MINUTES IF YOU CAN TOLERATOR IF YOUR REALLY COLD ADAPTED IF YOU DO SEVEN OR TEN MINUTES IN A COLD SHOWER ALTHOUGH THAT COULD BE A LOT MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE A SHARP INCREASE IN EPINEPHRON AN AGRENTLEAND AND A LONG LASTING INCREASE IN DOPAMINE FROM ONE TO THREE MINUTES OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE I DEALLY DONE IMMERSION UP TO THE NECK AGAIN DO THE SAFELY PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE OR A COLD SHOWER WE ARE GETTING UNDER THE SHOWERS MUCH AS POSSIBLE HOW COLD WHILE THAT'S GOEN A VERY PERSON AF PERSON I SUGGEST MAKING IT AS COLD AS IS UNCOMFORTABLE SUCH THE REALLY WANT TO GET OUT BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN STAY AND SAFELY WITHOUT FRENCS THAT IVEN YOURSELF A HARD ATTACK BECAUSE IF THE WATERS IT REALLY REALLY COLD OF COURSE YOU GAVE YOURSELF A HARD ATTECK MOST SHOWERS WON'T GO THAT COLD ALTHUGH PROBABLY SOME WILL GAN PLEASE USE CAUTION SPIKE YOUR GENTLAN SPIKE YOUR DOPOMIN WITH DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE SAFELY OTHER COMPONENTS OF HANG OVER THAT COULD BE GOOD TARGETES FOR TRYING TO ALLEVIATE HANG OVER AND HERE I HOPE YOU ARE GETTING THE PICTURE BECAUSE IT IS ACCURATE TO SAY THAT HANG OVER IS A MULTY FACID PHENOMENON IT'S NOT LIKE ONE MOLECULING ONE RECEPTORATES OF BUNCH OF THINGS HAPPENING INTHE BRAIN AN BODY BUT IS THE DEHIDRATION ASSOCIATED WITH I'L CALL 'LCALLS A DIARATIC FOR MULTIPLE REASONS IT CAUSED PEOPLE TO EXCRETE NOT ONLY WATER BUT ALSO SODIUM SODIUM AS AN ELECTROLITE CRITICAL FOR THE FUNCTION OF NURONS SO MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH SOTIAN POTACUMAN MAGNESIUM SO CHAT ELECTROLITES IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR PROPER BRAIN FUNCTION BO THE ORGAN FUNCTION EVEN FOR PEOPLE THEY HAVE JUST HAD ONE OR TWO DRINKS TE NIGHT BEFORE IT'S LIKELY THAT YOURE ELECTROLITE BALANCE AND YOUR FLUID BALANCE IS GOING TO BE DISTRUPPED IN THAT'S BECAUSE ALCALL ALSO DISTRUPTS THE SO CALLED VASE OPPRESSIN PATHWAY I TALK TO LOT ABOUT VES OPPRESSIN IN THE WAY THAT IT INTERRACTS WITH AND CONTROLS DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF WATER ATTENSION AND WATER RELEASE FROM THE BODY IN THE FORM OF URINE IN THE EPISODE ON SALT SO YOU GAN I'M PREFERRING TO CUBERMN LABDOC CALM AS THE SIGT WHERE YOU CAN FIND THAT E PISODE ON SALT BALANCE AND WAHTS TO RESTORE ELECTROLITE BALANCE HAVING YOUR ELECTROLIGHTS AT THE PROPER LEVELS BEFORE YOU DRINK IS IDEAL SOME PEOPLE WO SAY FOR EVERY GLASS OF ALCOHOL THAT YOU DRINK YOU SHOULD DRINK ONE GLASS OF WATER I WOULD SAY BETTER WOULD BE TWO GLASSES OF WATER GIVEN THE DEHIDRATING EFFECTS OF ALKOHOL AND EVEN BETTER WOULD BE WATER WITH ELECTROLYTS THAT CERTAINLY WOULD SET YOU UP FOR A BETTER DAY THE NEXT DAY AND IF YOU DON'T MANAGE TO DO THAT TO THE UPPOSE ITS KIND OF GEKI WALKING ROUND WITH ELECTROLIHE PACKETS OUT AT THE BAR OR WHAT NOT ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW IM IN GEKI MY BOOK IS A GOOD THING THE NEXT DAY YOU COULD TAKE SOME ELECTROLIGHTS UPON WAKING I MAYBE EVEN SOME BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP ATHE NIGHT OF DRINKING SO HANG OVERS MADE WORSE BY DISTURBED SLEEP MADE WORSE BY DESTRPTED GUT MY BIOM MADE WORSE BY DESTRUPTED ELECTROLIGHTS MADE WORSE BY THE DEPLETION OF EPINEPHRAN AN DOPOMINE THAT'S WHY REPLANISHING THE MICROBIUM WITH FERMENTED FOODS LOVE SUGAR FRORM ENTIFOOTS THAT IS THAT'S WHY USING SAFE DELIVERATE COLD EXPOSURE FOR SPIKING A DRENNALIN AND FOR INCREASING DOPOMINE AND THAT'S WHY CONSUMING ELECTROLYTES AR AL GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL THE FOLKS OVER IT EXAMINED OCOM A WEBSIGT THAT I REALLY LIKE BECAUSE IT JUST HAS SO MUCH USEFUL INFORMATION HAVE ASSEMBLED A LIST OF THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSE PROPORTED TO IMPROVE OR I SHOULD SAY TO REMOVE THE EFFECTS OF HANG OVER AND AS THEY POINT OUT AND I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT OVER THER THERE ISN'T A LOT OF QUALITY SCIENCE TO SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT ANY ONE COMPOUND CAN ELIMINATE HANG OVERAND THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE HANG OVER AGAIN ARISES FROM MULTIPLE ORGANS AND TISSUES AND SYSTEMS IN BOTH THE BRAIN AND BODY NONE THE LESS THEY HAVE A TERRIFIC AM LIST OVER THERE OF THINGS EVERYTHING FROM JAPANESE PARFRUIT JUICE HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO DO THIS TO A SOME OTHER REALLY ESOTERIC THINGS EVEN A THINGS LIKE YOHIMBINE A FRANKLY WHEN I LOOK AT THE LITERATURE THERE AND ELSEWHERE ONE SIMPLY CANNOT FIND THE MAGIC SUBSTANCE THE ONE ERB THE ONE POTION THAT CAN WIPE AWAY HANG OVER GETTING RID OF HANG OVER IS GOING TO BE BEST SOLVE BY DOING A COLLECTION OF A SMALL NUMBER OF VERY POWERFUL THINGS OF WHICH I'VE ALREADY LISTED OFF A FEW HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT ONE CAN DO FOR RELIEVING HANG OVER AND ONE OF THEM IS TO BE VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT WHAT SORTS OF ALKHOL ONE CONSUMES SO I FIND THIS INTERESTING THERE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN STUDIES OF WHICH TYPES OF ALCHOL LEAD TO THE GREATEST HANG OVERS THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF LEGEND AND LOWER ABOUT THIS A AS WELL SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID FOR INSTANCE THAT DRINKS THAT HAVE HIGH SUGAR CONTENT LEAD TO GREATER HANG OVERS TURNS OUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE OR LEAS THAT'S NOT WITH THE SCIENCE POINTS TO IF YOU LOOK AT THE EXPECTED HANG OVER SEVERITY WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT AT THE BOTTOM END OF THE SCALE THERE'S A DRINK THAT I'M NO CAN I TELL YOU FOR THE MOMENT BUT WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT NEAR IT IS FOR INSTANCE BEER THE THE CONSUMPTION OF BEER PROVIDED IT IS NOT OVER  CONSUMPTION RINHT IT'S NOT FAR BEYOND THE TOLERANCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL DOES ONE OR TWO BEERS IS LASS LIKELY TO CAUSE A HANG OVER THAN SAY WHISKY AND A GLASS OF WHISKIER I SHOULD YOU ARE NOT AS MUCH WHISKY AS BEER OF COURSE BUT A GLASS OF WHISKY FOR INSTANCE IS MORE LIKELY TO CAUSE HANG OVER THEN GIN IS IT TURNS OUT AGAIN THIS IS WHAT'S FALLEN OUT OF THE DATA AND YET A GLASS OF RUM OR RED WINE IS MORE LIKELY TO CAUSE A HANG OVER THAN ANY OF THE OTHER THINGS I'VE MENTIONED SO FAR AT THE TOP TOP TOP OF THE LIST OF DRINKS THAT INDUCE HANG OVER IS BRANDY AND ONE COULD THEN SAY WELL DOESN'T BRANDY OF A LOT OF SUGAR MAYBITS THE SUGAR THAT'S CAUSING HANG OVERS AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN AGAIN DISCUSSED OVER AND OVER THAT PEOPLE THAY OW IT'S THE HIGH SUGAR DRINKS THE CAUSE HANG OVER TURNS OUT HOWEVER THAT WHEN ONE LOOKS IT DRINKS ALCOLIC DRINKS AND SUGAR CONTENT AND HANG OVER AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE LIST IS GOSH THIS MAKES ME CRINGE JUST TO THINK ABOUT IS ETHANAL DILUTED IN ORANGE JUICE CIMPLE PEOPLEASH SHU DRINK THIS BUT ETHANAL DILUTED IN ORAGE JUICEO THERE'S NOT VADKAN ORANGE OGAY VADKA WIS THIRD ON THE LIST FROM THE BOTTOM OF DRINKS THAT INDUCE HANG OVER AGAIN THIS IS WITHIN AMOUNTS THAT ARE COMFORTABLE FOR THE PERSON TO DRNK THAT THEY HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE WITH OR THAT THEY HAVE THE BODY WEIGHT TO TOLERATE WITHOUT GETTING VERY VERY DRUNK SO THE POINT IS THAT IF IT WERE SUGAR THAT'S CAUSING HANG OVER WELL THEN THE ETHANAL DILUTIN ORANGE JUICE WOULD PROBABLY BE AT THE TOP OF THE LIST AND TO IN TERMS OF INDUCING HANG OVER BUT IT'S NOT 'S AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST AND BRANDY IS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST SO WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT WHAT SCALES FROM ATHANAL DILUDIN ORANGE JUICE TO BEER TO VADKA TO GIN HERE I'M ASSENDING THE HIRKEY OF THINGS THAT CAUSE HANG OVER GIN WHITE WINE WHISKY RUM RED WINE AND THEN BRANDY AT THE PEAK ITSOROF THE WORLD HAVEY WEIGHT CHAMPION OF HANG OVER INDUCING DRINKS WELL WHAT'S INCREASING ARE CONGUNERS WITHIN THOSE DRINKS CONGUNERS ARE THINGS LIKE NITTRITES AND OTHER SUBSTANCES THAT GIVE ALCOHOLE IT'S DISTINCTIVE FLAVOR AND THAT ALSO LEAD TO SOME OF THE ENEBRIATING EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL NOW THEN YOU ASK OCAYWILE WHAT IS IT THAT THESE CONGUNERS ARE DOING AND WHAT ARE THSE NITRATES DOING AND GUESSWAT WHILE THEY DO HAVE EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN AND ON OTHER TISSUES THEIR MAIN EFFECTS ARE TO DISRUPT THE GOT MYCROBIOM SO WHAT THIS POINTS TO AGAIN IS THAT HAVING A HEALTHY GOT MY CROBIUM AND PERHAPS INSURING THAT YOU BOLSTER YOU'RE GOT MYCROBIOM THE DAY AFTER DRINKING IS GOING TO BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR WORDING OFF HANG OVER AT LEAST REDUCING THE EFFECTS OF HANG OVER OR THE SYMPTOMS OF HANG OVER OR BOTH I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A STUDY ON THIS I COULD IMAGINE DESIGNING THE STUDY MYSELF ALTHOUGH THIS ISN'T REALLY THE SORTS OF THINGS MY LABORATORY DOES BUT CAN IMAGINE SOME PEOPLE GETTING PROBIOTIC AND PREBOTIC SOME REGULARLY SOME JUST AFTER DRINKING OR LOWSUGAR FERMENTED FOUTS AND SEE WHAT THE EFFECTS ARE IN TERMS OF SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS OF HANG OVER BUT ALSO SOME PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES THINK THAT WAY TO THINK ABOUT HANG OVER OVER ALL IS THAT AGAIN IT REPRESENTS A MULTIFASCITED MULTI ORGAN MULTI TISSUE PHENOMENON AND THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH IT IS AS A MULTISELL MULTI TISSUE MULTI CHEMICAL PHENOMENON AND BEFORE I LISTED OFF SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ONE CALD DO IN ORDER TO ADJUST HANG OVER AGAIN THE ONE THAT COMES OUT AT THE TOP OF THAT LIST I BELIEVE THE SPACED ON MY READ OF THE DATA IS TO SUPPORT THEY GOT MYCROBIUM AND CERTAINLY NOT TO IN JEST MORE ALCOHOL AND I SUPPOSE IF WE WERE TO GET REALLY HONEST WITH ONE ANOTHER AND ASK WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO AVOID TO HANG OVER IT WOULD BE DO NOT DRINK IN THE FIRST PLACE SO WE'VE COVERED THE MAJOR EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL THAT LEAD TO THIS STATE THAT WE CAL DRUNKENNESS OR INEBRIATION GAIN THERE'S A RANGE THERE BE TIPSY PEOPLE CAN BE BLACK OUT DRUNK PEOPLE CAN BE PASSED OUT DRUNK WE'VE ALSO TALK ABOUT HANG OVER AND THE FACT THAT IT'S A MULTI FASCITED PHENOMENON AND RECOVERY FROM HANG OVER INVOLVES A MULTIFASTETET APPROACH NEXT SO ONE TO TALK ABOUT TOLERANCE TOLERANCE TO ALCOHOL IS A VERY INTERESTING PHENOMENON HAS ROOTS MAINLY IN THE BRAIN AND IN BRAIN SYSTEMS THERE'S NOT TIME IN THE WORLD LET ALONE WITHIN THIS PODCAST TO GET INTO ALL THE ASPECTS OF TOLERANCE THERE ARE MORE THAN TEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF TOLERANCE THERE'S FUNCTIONAL TOLERANCE CHRONIC TOLERANCE RAPID TOLERANCE THERE'S METABOLIC TOLERANCE THERE'S PSYCHOLOGICAL TOLERANCE LET'S KEEP IT SIMPLE FORSAKE OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE INTERESTED IN LEARNING ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TOLERANCE AND ASPECTS OF TOLERANCE THERE IS AN EXCELLENT REVIEW WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THIS THIS WAS PUBLISH IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO IT'S PRETTY RECENT IN THE JOURNAL PHARMOCOLOGY ABOUR CHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR INSADILY OR NONSOENCE ONLY THAT WAS THE FIRST JOURNAL I AVE REPUBLISHON SO IHAVE A PARTICULAR AFFECTION FOR THAT JOURNAL NONE THE LESS IT IS CALLED TOLERNCE TO ALCOHOL A CRITICAL YET UNDERSTUDIED FACTOR AND ALCOHOL A DICTION AND WHILE THIS PAPER DOES INCLUDE ALCOL A DICTION IN THE TITLE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ALCHOL A DICTION HERE'S THE BASIC SUMMARY OF WHAT TOLERANCE IS FIRST OF ALL TOLERANCE REFERS TO THE REDUCED EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL WITH REPEATED EXPOSURE AND IT IS CAUSED MAINLY BY CHANGES IN NEURO TRANSMITTER SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN THAT ARE THE DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE TOCICITY OF ALCOHOL THAT ALDAHIDE MOLCULE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THERE'S ENORMOUS NUMBER OF CHEMICALS THAT CHANGE WITH REPEATED EXPOSURE TO SEETAL ALDAHIDE EVERYTHING FROM GABIT TO DOPAME TO SERATONAN SECOND MESSENG ER SYSTEMS A DENISINE AND ON AND ON RATHER THAN GOING TO EACH OF THOSE IN DETAIL I JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE CONTOUR OF THE REENFORCING AND THE TOLERANCE INDUCING EFFECTS OF ALCOL WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT WELL HERE WE ARE BACK TO OUR OLD FRIEND MEANING THE MOLECULE THAT COME UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THESE PODCAST EPISODES WHICH IS DOPAMINE WHETHER NOT SOMEBODY HAS A PREDISPOSITION ALCOLISM OR NOT WHETHER NOT THEIR EXPERIENCE DRINKER OR NOT WHEN PEOPLE INITIALLY START DRINKING THERE ARE INCREASES IN DOPAMINE OR WHAT WE CALL DOPAMANNURGIC TRANSMISTION DOPAMINE IS INVOLVED IN MOTIVATION CRAVING IT CREATES A SENSE I WELL BEING AT INCREASEIS ENERGY AGAIN TYPICALLY ONLY AT THE BEGINNING OF ALCOHOL EXPOSURE THAT OCCURS IN MOST PEOPLE AS A SHARP SPIKE AS A INCREASE AGAIN IF SOMEBODY DOES NOT HASE ALCOL DE HYDROGENES OR HAS VERY LOW LEVELS OF THE ENZIM THAT CONVERT THAT A SEETAL ALTIDE AND ACITATE AND THE METABOLIZE ALCHOLL ANOTHER WORDS THEY WILL FEEL SICK AND LOUSY IN A WAY THAT WILL OVERRIDE ANY RECOGNITION OF THE DOPAMIN RELEASE THER GUNS BE THE PEOPLE THERE LISTENG O THIS AND TIS THING ALCOLGIS MAKES ME FEEL SICK I DON'T LIKE IT WOCADE THATS A SPECIFIC SUBCATEGORY OF PEOPLE BUT MOST PEOPLE EXPERIENCE SOME SORT OF MILD EUPHORIA THAT'S WHY SO MANY PEOPLE DRINK RIT IT THE CORN ESTIMATES ARE THAT IN MOST COUNTRIES AND CERTAINLY IN THE UES AS MANY AS EIGHTY PER CENT TOF THE ADULT LEGAL DRINKING AGE POPULATION DRINKS ALCOHOL AND THAT NUMBER COULD BE EVEN HIGHER NOW BECAUSE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HAS BEEN A TREN TOWARDS INCREASE ALCOLCONSUMPTION ESPECIALLY IN THE WAKE OF THE PANDEMIC AND DURING THE PANDEMIC TOPIC FOR ANOTHER TIME SO THERE'S AN INCREASE IN DOPAMIN AND AN INCREASE IN CERETONAN SO IT'S O HAVE AN INCREASE IN WELL BEING AN INCREASE IN MOOD BUT IT'S A VERY SHORT LIVED INCREASE VERY SOON AFTER AND ACTUALLY TRIGGERED BY THAT INCREASE IS A LONG AND SLOW REDUCTION IN DOPAMINE AND CERETONAN AND RELATED MOLECULES AND CIRCUITS SO BASELY WHAT YOU'RE GETTING IS A BLIP OF FEEL GOOD FOLLOWED BY A LONG SLOW ARC OF FEELING NOT SO GREAT WHICH IS WHY TYPICALLY PEOPLE WOILL DRINK AGAIN AND AGAIN ACROSS THE NIGHT THE KEETHING TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT TOLERANCE IS THAT WITH TOLERANCE THE DURATION OF THAT LONG SLOW REDUCTION IN DOPAMINE AND CERATONAN GETS EVEN LONGER IN OTHER WORDS THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF ALCHOL THAT HAPPEN AFTER THE INITIAL FEELING GOOD EXTEND LONGER AND IN FACT GET MORE ROBUST HOWEVER THERE'S ALSO A REDUCTION IN THE REINFORCING PROPERTIES OF ALCOL THERE'S A SHRINKING OF THE FEEL GOOD BLIP THAT HAPPENS WHEN ONE FIRSTS IN GESS ALCOL  THIS HAS BEEN MEASURED IN ANIMALS AND HUMANS SO THE FIRST DRINK THAT SOMEBODY HAS PROVIDED THEY HAVE ENOUGH ALCL DEHYDROGENES THAT DOESN'T MAKE THEM FEEL NACIOUS AND SICK RIGHT AWAY THEY FEEL REALLY GOOD AND THEN AS IT WEARS OFF THEY FEEL CONALAUSING THEY WANT TO DRINK MORE SO THEY MIGHT DRINK MORE WITH EACH SUBSEQUENT DRINK AND EVEN DRINKS ON DIFFERENT NIGHTS OR EVEN DIFFERENT WEAK S THE AMOUNT OF DOPAMINE THAT'S RELEASED IS REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF CERTONA THAT S RELEASED IS REDUCE SO WHAT YOU'RE GETTING IS LESS AND LESS OF THE REENFORCING PROPERTIES OF ALCOHOL THE FEEL GOOD STUFF AND MORE AND MORE OF THE PUNISHMENT PAIN SIGNAL ASPECTS OF ALCOL THIS IS THE CONTOUR OF CHEMICAL RELEASE IN THE BRAIN THAT WAS REFERRED TO BY MY COLLEAGUE THE INCREDIBLE DOCTOR ONOLEMPKI WHOSE A MEDICAL DOCTOR SHE WROTE THE INCREDIBLE BOOK DOPOMI NATION SHE HAS GUESSED ON THIS PODCAST ON SHOR ROGAN'S PODCAST ON RICHROLLS PDCAST AND SEVERAL OTHER POCASTS WORLD EXPERT IN ADDICTION AS SHE TALKED ABOUT THIS PLEASURE PRAIN BALANCE THAT EXTENDS BEYOND ALCHOL TO THINGS LIKE SEXAND GAMBOLING AND TO OTHER BEHAVIORS THAT CAN POTENTIALLY BECOME ADDICTIVE BUT CERTAINLY INCLUDES ALCOL SO TOLERANCE IT SEEMS IS A PROCESS IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE INGESTING MORE AND MORE ALCOHOL AS AN ATTEMPT TO GET THAT FEELING OF WELL BEING BACK BUT WHAT THEYRE REALLY GETTING IS AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF PUNISHMENT OF PAIN AND OF MALAZ FROM THE ALCOL NOW YOU MIGHT SAY WHAT HOW DOES THAT RELATE TO TOLERANCE WHAT TURNS OUT WHAT THEY DO BEHAVIORLY AND WHEN I SAY THEY I MEAN ANIMALS DO THIS AN HUMANS DO THIS IS THEY START DRINKING MORE AND MORE IN AN ATTEMPT TO ACTIVATE THOSE DOPOMINE AND SIRATONEAN NERONS AND RECEPTORS AND AS THEY DO THAT THERE IS AN INCREASE IN ALCHOL TE HYDROGENI SO THE ENSIME THAT METABOLIZES ALCHL IS INCREASED BECAUSE T THE BODY AND LIVER HAVE TO CONTEND WITH ALL THAT ALCOHOL SO NOW YOU'VE GOT AGAIN THE TO HITMODEL YOU'RE GTTING LESS OF THE FEEL GOOD CHEMICALS MORE OF THE NEGATIVE CHEMICAL RELEASE OR PATTERN OF OF SUBJECTIVE FEELING I SHOULD SAY AND YOUR METABOLIZING ALCOHOL MORE QUICKLY AND MORE READILY BUT IT'S NOT TAKING YOU TO A BETTER PLACE AN TERMS OF HOW YOU FEEL THAT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR UNDERLYING REASONS FOR WHAT WE CALL TOLERANCE SO IF YOURE SOMEBODY WHO DRINKS AND YOU NOTICE THAT THE FEELING THAT YOU ARE SEEKING WITH ALCOHOL IS NOW REQUIRING AN ADDITIONAL DRINK OR DRINKS PLURAL CHANCES ARE YOU ARE DISERRUPTING THE DOPOMINE AND SERETENERGIC SYSTEMS OF YOUR BRAIN AND YOU ARE DOING THAT IN A WAY THAT IS INCREASING THE THE PAIN AND PUNISHMENT SIGNALS THAT FOLLOW ALCOHOL INGESTION AND AGAIN THAT'S NOTCHOUS ON THE NIGHT THAT YOU'R DRINKING BUT AFTERWARDS AS WEL IS THAT ALL BAD NEWS WELL PRETTY MUCH BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IF YOU ABSTAIN FROM DRINK FROM FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME THEN OF COURSE THESE SYSTEMIS RESET HOW LONG YOU NEED TO ABSTAIN WILL DEPEND ON HOW MUCH YOU WERE DRINKING AND HOW LONG YOU WRE DRINKING FOR CERTAINLY PEOPLE HAVE ORE ALCHOL USED DISORDER OR ALCOHOLICS THEIR MAINGALL SHOULD BE TO QUIT ALCOL COMPLETELY I KNOW THERE SOME DEBATE ABOUT THIS AND I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THAT DEBATE BECAUSE I'M CERTAINLY NOT OM GOTIN TO TRYING DIRECT ANY ONE'S RECOVERY THEIR EXPERT O COUNSELLORS AND AN EMDIS AND PEOPLE IT COOD WORK WITH PEOPLE IN FACT FOR SOME VERY HEAVY DRINKERS AND PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS ALCHL USED DISORDER GOING COLD TURKEY THAT IS STOPPING DRINKING COMPLETELY CAN A SHALLY BE MEDICALLY DANGEROUS SO THE PATH O SOBRIETY FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE LOOKS DIFFERENT THAN THE PATH TO SOBRIETY FOR OTHER PEOPLE WHAT I M REFERRING TO HER OR PEOPLE THAT ARE INJESTING AGAIN SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ON AVERAGE ONE ETO DRINKS PER NIGHT WHETHER NOT THAT DONE NIGHT TO NIGHT OR WHETHER NOT THATS CONDENSE TO WEEKAND USE I KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO ASK PERHAPS ARE SCREAMING IS DRINKING GOOD FOR ME IN ANY WAY FOR INSTANCE MANY PEOPLE HAVE PROBABLY HEARD THAT RESVERATRAL IS GOOD FOR PEOPLE THAT RED WINE IS EN RICH AND RESVERATRAL I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU BUT THE REALITY IS THAT IF INDEED RESVORRTRLL IS GOOD FOR US AND THERE SOME DEBATE ABOUT THIS SOME PEOPLE SAY STRONGLY YES SOME PEOPLE SAY NO OTHER PEOPLE SAY MAYBE THE AMOUNT OF RED WINE THAT ONE WOULD HAVE TO DRINK IN ORDER TO GET ENOUGH RESVERTRALL IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE HEALTH PROMOTING IS SO OUTRAGEOUSLY HIGH THAT IT WOULD SURELY INDUCE OTHER NEGATIVE EFFECTS THAT WOULD OFFSET THE PAUS OF EFFECTS OF RESTERTRAL SO I WISH I COUL TELL YOU DIFFERENT GAN ON NOT HERE TO BE THE BEAR OF BAD NEWS BUT THE STATEMENT I JUST MADE WAS CONFIRMED BY DOCTOR DAVIDSON CLARE WHEN HE WAS A GUEST ON THIS POD CAST S CONFIRMED BY OTHER RESEARCHERS WHO WORK ON RESVERTRALLN RELATED PATHWAYS I WISH I COULD TELL YOU THAT RED WINE IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH AND INDEED IT MIGHT BE THROUGH SOME OTHER MECHANISMS SO FOR INSTAS THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES OF LOW TO MODERATE RED WINE CONSUMPTION THIWOULD BE ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO FOUR GLASSES PER WEEK AND I DON'T MEAN ENORMOUS GLASSES I MEAN SIX OUNCE GLASSES OF RED WINE AND THOSE CASES SOME OF THE STRESS REDUCTION THAT CAN BE INDUCED BY CONSUMPTION OF RED WINE MAY BE SOME OF THE OTHER MICERO NUTRIENTS IND COMPONENTS WITHIN RED WINES IN PARTICULAR RED WINES THAT COME FROM PARTICULAR GRAPES AN THIS GETS REALLY NUANTS AND FRANKLY IS NOT WELL WORKED OUT IN THE PURE REVIEWED LITERATURE CERTAINLY NOT CLINICAL TRIALS AT LEAST NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF TELL ME IF YOU RE AWARE OF A GREAT CLINICAL TRIAL IN THIS WELL THERE MAY BE SOME POSITIVE EFFECTS OF THAT VERY LOW LEVEL OF CONSUMPTION I'M NOT TRYING TO TAKE AWAY ANYBODY IS RED WINE ON A TRYING TO I TAKE AWAY ANYBODYES ANYTHING I WOULD BE REMISS HOWEVER IF I DIDN TELL YOU THAT RESTS VERATRAOLL AS THE ARGUMENT FOR DRINKING AND DRINK OF RED WINE IN PARTICULAR IS JUST NOT A GOOD ONE IS JUST NOT SUPPORTED BY THE PURE VIEW RESEARCH A FEW OTHER THINGS ABOUT ALCOHOL AND HEALTH THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE I REFERENCE TO STUDY SHOWING THAT INDEED NOT JUST HEAVY ALCOLL CONSUMPTION OF TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR OR MORE DRINKS PER WEEK BUT ALSO LIGHT TO MODERATE ALCOLL CONSUMPTION OF ANY TYPE WINE BEER SPIRITS ET CETERA DOES REDUCE THE THICKNESS OF THE BRAIN ITE REALLY DOES REDUCE CORTICAL THICKNESS IN FACT IN ACTUALLY SCALES WITH THE AMOUNT OF ALCOLL THAT PEOPLE DRINK AND THIS HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED IN A NUMBER OF DIFERENT STUDIES I CON PRVIDE A LINK TO SEVERAL OF THESE ONE OF THE MORE STRIKING ONES ACTULLY SHOWS THAT THERE'S ALMOST A DOSE DEPENDENT INCREASE IN SHRINKAGE OF GREYMOTER VOL LUME AND IN THESE WHITE MATTER TRACTS THESE A AXONS THESE WIRES AS IT WILD THAT CONNECT DIFFERENT NURONS AS A FUNCTION OF HOW MUCH ALCHL PEOPLE DRINK AND THAT'S ALSO WHAT'S BEEN SEEN IN THIS RECENT STUDY ON THAT I REFERENCE AT THE BEGINNING IN THAT IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS SO AGAIN PROBABLY THE BEST AMOUNT OF ALCHOL TO DRINK WOULD BE ZERO GLASSES PER WEEK OR OUNCES PER WEEK FOR THOSE ARE YOU DRINKING LOW MOUNTS OF ALCOHOL MAKE SURE YOUR DOING OTHER THINGS TO PROMOTE YOUR HEALTH AND FOR THOSE RETHER DRINKING MODERATE AND CERTAINLY FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE HEAVY DRINKERS PLEASE A DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO MOVE AWAY FROM THAT AND QUIT ENTIRELY BUT EVEN FOR THE MODERATE CONSUMERS OF ALCOHOL YOU ARE GOING TO WONT TO BE AWARE OF SOME OF THE NEGATIVE HALFEFFECTS IN DUE THINGS TO OFFSET THOSE IF INDEED YOU'RE NOGOINE TO STOP DRINKING OR REDUCE YOUR INTAKE ONE OF THE REALLY BAD EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL BUT THAT'S EXTREMELY WELL DOCUMENTED IS THE FACT THAT ALCOHOL BECAUSE OF THIS TOXICITY OF A SEETAL ALDOHIDE AND RELATED PATHWAYS CAN ALTER DIANAMETHYLATION AND CAN ALTER GENUXPRESSION THAT CAN BE MANY THINGS IN DIFFERENT TISSUES BUT IT IS ASSOCIATE WITH A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CANCAR RISK IN PERTICULAR BREAST CANCER AND IN PARULAR BECAUSE BREAST TISSUE IS PRESEN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES BUT IN WOMEN IT'S ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO SOME OF THE DEANA METHELLATION CHANGES WELL BREASTCANCSER AND WOMEN HAS A RELATIONSHIP TO ALCHOL AND TAKE AN ALCHL AND TAKE HAS A RELATIONSHIP TO BREASTCANCER IN WOMEN IN FACT THERE HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO BE A ANYWHERE FROM FOUR TO THIRTEEN PER CENT INCREASE IN RISK OF BREASTCANTS OR FOR EVERY TEN GRAHAMS OF ALCHOL CONSUMED HOW MUCH IS TEN GRAHAMS WELL THERE WE NEEN TO THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE VARIATION IN THE MOUNT OF ALCOHL AND DIFFERENT DRINKS ACROSS THE WORLD DIFFERENT COUNTRIES SERVE DIFFERENT SIZE DRINKS AND HAVE DIFFERNT CONCENTRATIONS OF ALCHOL IN THOSE DRINKS WITHOUT GOING DOWN TOO MUCH OF A RABBIT HOLE JUST GIVING YOU SOME GOOD RULES OF THUMB TO WORK WITH THERE BEEN STUDIES OF THE PERCENTAGE OF ALCHL INCLUDING DIFFERENT DRINKS AND THE SIZES OF DIFFERENT DRINKS THAT ARE SERVED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND HERES A KIND OF A A PATCHWORK OF OF THOSE FINDINGS IN JAPAN ONE BEER ONE GLASS OF WINE OR ONE SHOT OF LIQUOR AS IT SERVED THERE TENS TO INCLUDE ANYWHERE FROM SEVEN TO EIGHT GRAHAMS OF ALCHOL IN THE YOU SS ONE BEER WHICH GENERALLY IS TWELVE OUNCES IF IT'S AN A BODEL ONE GLASS OF WINE OR SHOT OF LIQUOR TENDS TO INCLUDE A BOUT TEN TO TWELVE GRAHAMS OF ALCOHL AND IN RUSSIA ONE DRINK OF THE VERY SORTS I HAVE JUST DESCRIBED TYPICALLY WILL HAVE AS MUCH AS TWENTY FOUR GRAHAMS OF ALCHOL BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCES IN THE CONCENTRATION OF ALCOHOLS AND THE SIZE OF OF DRINKS THAT ARE POURED IN THESE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OF COURSE THERRE OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD THOSE COUNTRIES ARE ALSO VITALLY IMPORTANT BUT THOSE OF THE ONES THAT EXTRACTED FROM THE STUDIES THAT I COULD FIND WHAT DOES THIS MEAN WELL WHER WEE TALKING ABOUT IS THAT FOR EVERY TEN GRAMS OF ALCOHOL CONSUMED SO THAT ONE BEER IN THE US AY BE A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN ONE BEER IN JAPAN OR BASICALLY A THIRD OF A DRINK IN RUSSIA THERE'S A FOR TO THIRTEEN PERSCEND INCREASE IN RISK OF CANCER THAT'S PRETTY OUTRAGEOUS RIGHT AND YOU MIGHT THINK WHAY HOW COULD IT BE THAT YOU KNOW THE STUFF IS EVEN LEGAL WELL LOOK IT'S AS I DESCRIBE BEFORE IT'S A TOIND IT'S ALSO A TOXIN THAT PEOPLE ENJOY THE EFFECTS OF I MEAN IN THE UAS AT LEAST THE TRIED PROHIBITION ON CERTAINLY DID LEAD YES DID LAD TO A REDUCTION IN ALCOHOL INDUCE HEALTH DISORDERS IN PARTICULAR SAROSIS OF THE LIVER IT ALSO LED TO A LOT OF CRIME BECAUSE IT BECAME A A SUBSTANCE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL STILL WANTED AND THAT PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO BREAK THE LAW IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THAT RISIAS AT TO CELL AND PROVIDE BUT THE POINT IS THAT THE MORE ALCOHOL PEOPLE DRINK THE GREATER THERE INCREASE OF CANCER IN PARTICULAR BREAST CANCER AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT ALCOHOL HAS THESE EFFECTS ON CELLS THAT INCLUDE CHANGES IN GENE EXPRESSION AND CANCER THAT IS THE GROWTH OF TUMORS IS A DISREGULATION IN CELL CYCLES RIHT A TUMOR IS A AGGREGATION OR THE PRELIFERATION AGGREGATION IF STUFFSTICKING TOGETHER BY THE WAY PRELIFERATION IS STUFF DUPLICATING AT PRELIFERATION AGGREGATION OF CELLS THAT COULD BE A GLEOMAS GLEO CELLS GLEOMA BRAIN TUMOR RIGHT CO BE LIMPHOMA SO WITHIN THE LIMPTISSUE ET CETERA THE MUTATIONS THAT ALCOL INDUCES TO CAUSE THIS ARE WIDE RANGING SOME OF THOSE ARE STRINGTED STARE TO BE UNDERSTOOD FOR THOSE WHO EITHER INTEREST IN CELL BY ALGO JUST MENTION THAT THE PEDY ONE PATHWAY AGAIN THIS IS IS SUPER A SPECIALIZIM FOR THE OFFICIONATOS ONLY YOU ON'T NEED TO KNOW THIS THE PETY ONE PATHWAY SEEMS TO BE UPREGULATED AND AND WE KNEW THIS FROM THE DISCUSSION EARLIER THERE'S A DOWN REGULATION IN SOME OF THE ANTI IN FLAMATORY MOLECULES THAT HELP SUPPRESS THE PRELIFERATION OF CANCERS NOW DAYS THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN THE FACT THAT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS CONSTANTLY COMBATING CANCERS THAT EXIST IN US ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW LITTLE LITTLE TUMOR START GROWING IN OUR MUNSYSTEM GOES AND GOBBLES THEM UP LITTLE TUMOR STAR GROWING THE MUN SYSTEM SENSE IS INFLAMMATION SENDS OUT THESE INCREDIBLE CELLS THESE KILLERS BECELLS AND TECELLS AND AND AND BEATS THEM UP CANCERS PRELIFERATE AND TAKE HOLD AND CAUSE SERIOUS PROBLEMS WHEN THE PROLIFERATION OF CELLS EXCEEDS THE IMUNE SYSTEMS ABILITY TO GOBBLE UP AND REMOVE THOSE CELLS THERE ARE OTHER MECHANISMS OF REGULATING CANCERS BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE PRIMARY ONE AND ALCOHOL HITS IT AGAIN AS A TO HIPMODEL IT INCREASES TUMOR GROWTH AND IT DECREASES THE SORTS OF MOLECULES THAT SUPPRESS AND COMBAT TUMOR GROWTH SO AGAIN EVEN LOD O MODERATE AMOUNTS OF ALCHOL CAN BE PROBLEMATIC FOR SAKE OF CANCERS IN PARTICULAR BREAST CANCERS EPODEMIOLOGIST AND HALSPECIALISTS LOVE TO TRYING COMPARE DIFFERENT SUBSTANCE IS IN TERMS OF HOW BAD THEY ARE RARELY DO THEY COMPARE SUBSTANCES IN TERMS OF HOW GOOD THEY ARE A BUT SOMETIMES THEY DO AND WHAT THEY'LL SOMETIMES TELL YOU IN WHAT YOU CON FINED IN THE LITERATURE IS THAT IN JESTING TEN TO FIFTEEN GRAHAMS OF ALCHOLDAY SO THAT WOULD BE ONE BEER IN TH OU S ONE GLASS OF WINE IS THE SAME AS SMOKING TEN CIGARETTES A DAY FRANKLY IT'S HARD TO MAKE THAT DIRECT RELATIONSHIP REALLY STICK BECAUSE YOU KNOW ITS A QUESTION OF YOU KOW HOW LONG PEOPLE INHAL DO THEY HAVE A PREDISPOSITION TO A LUNG CANCER ET CETERA BUT EVEN IF THAT NUMBER IS OFF BY PLUSERMINUS TO CIGARETTES OR EVEN IF THAT NUMBER WOULD THE EQUIVALENT OF ONE GLASS OF WINE EQUALS ONE CIGARETTE PER DAY I THINK THERE'S GENERAL CONCENSUS NOW THAT NICOTINE CONSUNE BY VAPING OR BY CIGARETTE IS BAD FOR US IN TERMS OF LUNG CANCER AND OTHER FORMS OF CANCER AND FOR SOME REASON I DON'T KNOW WHY BECAUSE THIS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ALCOHOL AND CANCER IN THESE ESTABLISHD RELATIONSHIPS HAVE BEEN KNOWN SINCE THE LATE NINETEEN EIGHTS THE FIRST YOU KNOW CON LANDMARK PAPER ON THIS WITH PUBLISH IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN I CONFIDE A LINK TO THAT FAVOR ITES ITHOULD QUITE INTERESTING ONTO READ WELL THAT RELATIONSHIP IS THERE AND YET WE DON'T OFTEN HEAR ABOUT IT I IN FACT IN BEFORE RESEARCHING THIS EPISODE IHAD HURRD BEFORE THAT ALCOHOL CAN INCREASE CANCER RISK BUT I WASN'T AWARE OF JUST HOW STRONG THAT RELATIONSHIP IS BECAUSE OF THE SERIOUS NATURE OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND BECAUSE I WOULD HATE TO BE CONFUSING OR MISLEADING TO ANYBODY I WANTED TOUST EMPHASIZE THAT THIS STATISTIC THAT THERE IS A FOUR TO THIRTEEN PER CENT DEPEND ON WHICH STUDY LOOK AT A FOUR TO THIRTEEN PER CENT INCREASE IN THE RISK OF CANCER IN PARTICULAR BREAST CANCER FOR EVERY TEN GRAHAMS OF ALCHOL CONSUMED THAT'S TEN GRAHAMS PER DAY SO THAT'S ONE DRINK PER DAY BUT I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT IF THAT ET QUATES TO SEVEN DRINKS PER WEEK AND ALL THOSE SEVEN DRINKS ARE BEING CONSUMED ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY IT'S STILL AVERAGES TO TEN GRAHAMS PERDAY AND I ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO TO AT LEAST PARTIALLY OFFSET SOME OF THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF ALCHOL AS IT RELATE TO PREDISPOSITION TO THE FORMATION OF CERTAIN KINDS OF TUMORS AND CANCERS I ALSO ON TO BE CLEAR BEFORE I SAY IT THAT DOING THE THINGS I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU IS NOT A GUARANTEE THAT YOURE NOT GOING TO GET CANCER NOR IS IT A GUARANTEE THAT ALCOHOL IS NOT GOING TO LEAD TO AN INCREASED PREDISPOSITION FOR CERTAIN CKINDS OF CANCERS AND THE TWO THINGS ARE CONSUMPTION OF FULLLATE AND OTHER BEVIDEMENTS ESPECIALLY BE TWELVE NO THAT THE CONSUMPTION OF FULL AGTE AND BE TWELVE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO DECREASE CANCER RISK IN PEOPLE THAT IN JUST ALCOHOL BUT NOT COMPLETELY OFFSET IT WHY THAT IS ISN'T EXAC CTLLY CLEAR IT PROBABLY HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FOLATE AND BE TWELVE AND OTHER BE VITEMENS IN GENE REGULATION PATHWAYS THAT CAN LEAD TO TUMOR GROWTH SOME POINT SOON WE WILL GET AN EXPERT IN CANCER BIOLOGY AND IN PARTICULAR IN BREASTCANCER BIOLOGY ON THE PROGRAME WHEND WE CAN ASKD HEM ABOUT THIS BUT I REALIZE THIS IS GOING TO RAISE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS AND MAY BE EVEN CAUSE SOME OF YOU TO GO OUT THERE AND START TAKING FOLATE AN OTHER BE VITEMENS AND BE TWELVE NOT INCIDENTALLY A LOT OF THE REPORTED HANG OVER SUPPLEMENTS AND TREATMENTS HAVINCLUDE FOLTE AND BE TWELVE I DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAD THE CANCER LITERATURE AN MIND WHEN THEY CREATED THOSE SUPPLEMENTS AND AND PRODUCTS I DOUBT THEY DID ALCOHOL REALLY DOES DISRUPT BE VITEMAN PATHWAYS BOTH SYNTHESIS PATHWAYS AND UTILIZATION PATHWAYS SO SOMETIMES YOU'LL HERO YOU KNOW IF YOU GET YOUR BE VITEMINS HELPS YOU RECOVER FROM FROM HANG OVER MORE QUICKLY AGAIN THE LITERATURE DOESN'T SUPPORT THAT BUT ALSO AGAIN THERE ARE 'N A LOT OF STUDIES BUT MORE TO THE POINT AS IT RELATES TO ALCOHL IN THE FORMATION OF TUMORS AND CANCERS IT DOES APPEAR THAT DECREASED FOLATE AND OTHER BE VIDEMENTS LIKE BE TWELVE ARE PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EFFECT OF ALCOHOL AND INCREASING CANCER RISK AND IT DOES APPEAR THAT CONSUMING ADEQUATE AMOUNTS OF FULATE AND BE TWELVE MIGHT AGAIN MIGHT PARTIALLY REALLY WANT A BOLD FACE AND UNDERLINE AND HIGHLAY PARTIALLY OFFSET SOME OF THAT INCREASED RISK THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL CATEGORY THAT I WANT HIGHLIGHT OF COURSE AND THIS IS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO STATE EVEN THOUGHE IT'S OBVIOUS WHICH IS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE PREGNENT SHOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT CONSUME ALCOHOL FEEDAL ALCOHOL CYNDRUM IS WELL KNOWN AND ESTABLISHED ITS TERRIBLE PEATUSIS EXPERIENCE DIMINISHED BRAIN DEVELOPMENT THAT'S OFTEN PERMANENT DIMINISHD LIM DEVELOPMENT DIMINISH ORGAN DEVELOPMENT IN THE PERIFERY MEANING YOU ON THE HART THE LUNGS DELIVER AT CETERA INJUSTING ALCHOLWHAL PREGNANT IS SIMPLY A BAD IDEA AND THE REASE I SAY THIS AT ALL IS FIRST OF ALL IT'S IMPORTANT TO INCLUDED AN EPISODE LIKE THIS BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE CAN LOOK AT TWO THINGS FIRST WHALE WE CAN LOOK AT MECHANISM AND THN WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT SOME OF THE LORE THAT STILL SADLY EXISTS OUT THERE LET'S TAKE CARE OF THE LORE THAT SADLY EXISTS FIRST IF YOU LOOK ON LINE YOU WILL SOMETIMES BE ABLE TO FIND SADLY THAT SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN KINDS OF ALCOHOL ARE NOT DETRIMENTAL TO PETUSIS THEY'LL SAY WELL CHAMPAGNE IS SAFE FOR A PREGNANT MOTHER TO DRINK BUT BEER IS NOT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CATEGORICALLY FALSE ALCOHOL IS ALCOHOL THERE IS NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT CONSUMING CERTAIN TYPES OF ALCOHOL IS SAFER PAFETUSIS THAN OTHERS ALCOL AS A TOXIN AND THE REASON FIDALALCOLL CENDRUM EXISTS IS BECAUSE THE ABILITY OF THAT TOXIN TO DESTRUPT CELLER PROCESSIES REMEMBER TUMOR GROWTH AND THE WAY THAT ALCOL CAND ACCELERATE TUMOR GROWTH BY PRELIFERATION OF CELLS THE WRONG CELLS THE ONES YOU DON'T WANT TO PRELIFERATE WELL ALL OF EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT ALL OF FEEDAL DEVELOPMENT IT'S NOT THE GROWTH OF A TUMOR IT'S OBVIOUSLY THE GROWTH OF AN EMBRYO AND IT'S DONE IN A VERY ORCHESTRATED WAY I STARTED OFFSTUDYING BRAIN DEVELOPMENT THAT'S WHERE I GOT MY BEGINNINGS IN NEUROBIOLOGY AND I STILL TEACH EMBREOLOGY TO MEDICAL STUDENTS AND GRADUATESTUDENS THE SET OF CORDINATED PROCESSIES THAT HAS TO TAKE PLACE FROM CONCEPTION TO BIRTH IN ORDER TO GIVE RISE TO A HEALTHY EMBRYO IS SO SO DYNAMICALLY CONTROLLED AND SO EXQUISITELY PRECISE WITH CHECK POINTS AND RECOVERY MECHANISMS AND REDUNDENCY IN THE GENES THAT ARE EXPRESS TO MAKE SURE THAT IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG IT'S PREPAIRED ET CETERA ALCOHOL AS A MUTIGEN HAVEN'T USE THAT WORD YET BUT IT SUBSTANCE THAT CAN MUTATE DIANA THROUGH ALTERATIONS IN DIANAMETHILATION AND THESE CHECK POINTS IN THE SELCYCL ALCOL IS A MUTIGEN IS ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT A DEVELOPING EMBRYO CAN BE EXPOSED TO AND AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S WATER SOLUBLE AND FATSOLIBLE INGESTION OF ALCOHOL WHEN PEOPLE PREDNENT PASSES RIGHT TO THE FEATUS NOW I REALIZE THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUTP THERE MIGHT BE THINKING O GOODNESS YOU KNOW I DIDN REALIZE I WAS PREGNANT UNTIL A CERTAIN STAGE OF PREGNANCY AND BEFORE I REALIZE I WAS INJESTING ALCOHOL OBVIOUSLY ONE CAN'T UNDO WHAT'S BEEN DONE BUT I WANT O ALSO EMPHASIZE THAT FEEDAL ALCOHOL CYNDRUM WHILE YES THERE'S A FULL BLOWN CYNDRUM THAT MANIFESTS AS CHANGES IN THE CRANI OFFACIAL DEVELOPMENT THAT ARE VERY OBVIOUS AND HE CAN LOK THESE UP BEPROLY SEEN THESE BEFORE OR THE PICTURES BEFORE RATHER AS TO DO TH ISPASING FOREHEAD SIZE AND NUMBER OF OTHER FEATURES OF THE CRANIOFACIAL DEVELOPMENT AND OF COURSE STUFFS GOING ON IN THE BRAIN TO IT'S A LONG A CONTINUUM SO IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT OCCUR ARE MORE MINER AND THANKFULLY THE YOUNG BRAIN IN PARTICULAR THE EARLY POST NATAL BRAIN IS INCREDIBLY PLASTIC THERE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE IN ORDER TO HELP RECOVERNERAL CIRCUITS THAT IN DEVELOP WELL ET CETERA BUT EVEN THOUGH ITSOMEWHAT OBVIOUS SOR SHOULD BE OBVIOUS I REALLY WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THERE' ZERO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT CERTAIN FORMS OF ALCOHOL ARE SAF FOR FOR PREGNANT WOMEN TO INJEST AN OTHERS ABSOLUTELY WRONG NO ONE WHOSE PREGNANT SHOULD BE INJESTING ALCOHOL WHATSOEVER AND CERTAINLY IF PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T AVOID ALCOHOL WHILE PREGNANT THEY REALLY NEED TO WORK WITH SOMEBODY TO MAKE SURE THAT IT JUST ABSOLY DOESN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE IS SO JETRAMENTAL TO THE DEVELOPING FEETUS LASTLY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON HORMONES AND I WANT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN LOW AMOUNTS OF ALCOHL IN TAKE HIGHER AMOUNTS OF ALCOL AN TAKEN AGAIN THIS CHRONIC ALCHOL IN TAKE VERSES OCATIONAL USE VERSIS REALLY CHRONICUSE MEANING ALCOHOLIC OR ALCHOLIC USE DISORDER WHERE PEOPLE ARE DRINKING IN AMENSE AMOUNT ON AN ON GOING BASIS THE LITERATURE ON ALCOL AN HORMONES IS QUITE EXTENS IVE AND THERE OF COURSE MANY MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF HORMONES THE HORMONES THAT MOSTOPHEN YET MENTIONED AND TALKED ABOUT ON THIS PODCAST OL THE HORMONE'S TESTOSTERONE AND ESTEROGEN WHICH ARE PRESENT IN BOTH MEN AND WOMEN THAT IN BOTH MEN AND WOMEN ARE IMPORTANT FOR THINGS LIKE LEBIDO THE ALSO RESPONSIFUL FOR SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT ACTUAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE GENATALIA BEFORE BIRTH AND AFTERBIRTH THERE RESPONSIBLE FOR INSTANCE ESTEROGENIS IMPORTAN FOR MEMORY AND COGNITIEN YOU NEVER WANT A DROP ESTEROGEN TO LOW IN MEN OR WOMEN CAUSE IT CAN DISTRUPT COGNITION AND JOINT HEALTH ET CETERA TO KEEP THIS DISCUSSION RELATIVELY CONSTRAINED IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT ALCOHOL AND IN PARTICULAR THE TOXIC METABOLITES OF ALCOHOL INCREASE THE CONVERSION OF TESTOSTERONE TO ESTEROGEN NOW THIS OCCURS IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TISSUES THIS IS NOTJUS OCCURRING IN THE TESTIES OF MALES AS AS OCCRRING IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT TISSUES AND I'LL REFER YOU TO A EXCELLENT REVIEW WILL PROVIDED LINCON THE SHOWN O CAPTIONS THIS IS A PAPER THAT WAS PUBLISHING THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND BUT THE DATE ARE STILL A QUITE STRONG THE JOURNAL IS CALLED OF ALL THINGS ALCOHOL YES LITERALLY A JOURNAL CALLED ALCOHOL FOR THE PUBLICATION OF DATA IN REVIEWS ON ALCLON ITS EFFECTS AND THE TITLE THE PAPERS CAN ALCOHOL PROMOTE A ROMATIZATION OF ANDROGENS TO ESTROGENS A ROMANIZATIONS THIS PROCESS OF THE CONVERSIEN OF TESTOSTRONE AND OTHER ANDROGENS TO ESTROGENS THROUGH THINGS LIKE A ROMATAS ENSON AND THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL REVIEW THAT DESCRIBED EVERY TISSUE OR NEAR EVERY TISSUE FROM THE OVERIAN FEMALES TO THE PLOCENTA TO THE LIVER TO THE TESTIS IN WHICH ALCOHOL CAN INCREASE THE A ROMANIZATION OF TESTSTRONDASTRGEN NOW IN FEMALES THIS MAY BE PART OF THE REASON WHY THEREIS AN INCREASE IN ESTEROGEN RELATED CANCERS BRES CANCER CAN BE EITHER ESTROGEN RELATED OR NON ESTEROGEN RELATED THEIR OTHER TYPES OF ESTEROGEN RELAYR CANCERS OUTSIDE OF BRES CANCER BUT IT APPEARS THAT ONE REASON WHY ALCOL INCREASES THE RISCOBRESCANCER IS BECAUSE OF THIS A ROMANIZATIEN FROM OF TESTOSTRONSCUSE ME TO ESTEROGEN IN MALES ACCELERATED OR ABNORMAL CONVERSION OF TESTOSTERON TESTEROGEN CONASTIOUL LEAD TO GROWTH OF THE BREST TISSUE IN MALES SO CALED GANA COMASTIA OR OTHER EFFACTS OF HIGH ESTROGEN WHER I SHOULD SAY OF ALTERED TESTOSTERONE ESTEROGEN RATIOS CA THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S IMPORTANT AND THESE CAN INCLUDE THINGS LIKE DIMINISHSEX STRIVE A INCREASE FAT STORIAGE AND A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS THAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE I WOULD FIND TO BE NEGATIVE EFFECTS I ONCE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT DRINKING ALCOL CAN INCREASED THE A ROMANIZATION OF TESTOSTRONE TO ESTEROGEN I POSTED THAT ON LINE AND I DIDN'T GET ATTACKTD BUT I DID A GET CRITICIZED FOR THE FACT THAT IT HAS BEEN SHOWN YES HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT SMALL AMOUNTS OF ALCOL IN GESTIONS OF FIVE GRAHAMS OR SO OF ALCOL IN GESIONS O BE HALF A GLASON WINE OR HALF A GLASS OF BEER AT LEAST IN SOME STUDIES SHOWED INCREASES IN TESTOSTRONE WHICH WAS KIND OF SURPRISING BUT I SHOULD POINT OUT OTHER STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT ALCHOL INGESTION CAUSES DECREASES IN TESTOSTERONE OVER TIME SO THERE'S ALWAYS IS ISSUE WHITHER NOT YOUR LOOKING A STUDY OF ACUTE EXPOSURE VOR SIS CHRONIC EXPOSINA ONE DOSE FIRSES MULTIPLE DOSIS AN EXPOSURE I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY BASED ON MY READ OF THE LITERATURE THIS REVIEW AND OTHER REVIEWS THAT FOCUS MORE PARTICULARLY ON HUMANS THAT REGULAR INGESTION OF ALCHOL IS GOING TO INCREASE ESTERGEN LEVELS WHETHER NOT YOUR MALE OR FEMALE AND IT'S LARGELY DOING THAT THROUGH THE ROMANIZATION PROCESS BY INCREASING THE ROMATASTES ENDS ON YES THERE SOME DOSE DEPENDENCE BUT I THINK IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHOIS TRYING TO OPTIMIZE YOUR TESTOSTERONE TO ESTRGEN RATIO REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT YOUR MALE OR FEMALE WELL THEN MOST CERTAINLY YOU'RE GOING TO ONE TO AVOID DRINKING TO MUCH ALCOHOL WE'VE COVERED A LOT OF TOPICS AND DATA RELATED TO THE MECHANISMS OF ALCOHOL HANG OVER TOLERANCE CANCER RISK ET CETERA I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I MAINLY TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MANY PEOPLE ENJOY ALCHOL IN MODERATION OR EVEN LIGHT DRINKING THE OCCASIONAL DRINK OR THE OCCASIONAL TWO DRINKS OR MAYBE EVEN ON AVERAGE ONE DRINK PERNIHTE O SEVEN DRINKS PER WEEK I'M CERTAINLY NOT HERE TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO AND WHAT NOT TO DO I DO FIND IT IMMENSELY INTERESTING HOWEVER THAT FIRST OF AL ALCOHOL IS A KNOWN TOXIN TO THE CELLS OF THE BODY SOME OF YOU MIGHT IMMEDIATELY SAY WHAT WAIT WHAT ABOUT HORMESIS WHAT ABOUT THIS PHENOMENON WEARE IF WE REGULARLY INGESTATOXON IT MAKES US STRONGER IN OTHER WARS WHAT DOESN'T KILL US MAKES U STRONGER THAT THERE'S YOU KNOW SOME REASON TO BELIEVE THAT MIGHT BE BENEFICIAL IN TERMS OF SOME FORMS OF CELLAR RAZILIENTCS MAYBE MAYBE NOW SORRY IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY THERE ARE PROCESSES OF HORMESIS IN WHICH FOR INSTANCE EXPOSING YOURSELF SAFELY TO INCREASES AN EDRENALINE THROUGHYOU KNOW ICE BATHS OR OTHER THINGS THAT INCREASE A DRENALINE CAN RAISE YOUR SO CALLED STRESS THRESHOLD BUT HERE WERE TALKING ABOUT CELER STRESS AND DAMAGE TO CELLS SO MY READ OF THE LITERATURE AND AGAIN THIS IS MY READON I INVITE OTHERS TO YOU KNW PROVIDE STUDIES OR I WOULD PREFER ACTUALLY COLLECTIONS OF STUDIES THAT POINT IN THE DIRECTION IF THEY EXIST THAT ALCOHL CAN BE BENEFICIAL BUT MY READ OF THE LITERATURE WHER I SHOULD SAY MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT I WOULD CALL THE CENTERE OF MASS OF THE LITERATURE ON ALCOHOL IS THAT NO CONSUMPTION ZERO CONSUMPTION CONSUMPTION OF ZERO ALNCES OF ALCOHOL IS GOING TO BE BETTER FOR YOUR HEALTH THAN LOW TO MODERATE CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHL AND THAT LOW TO MODERATE CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL IS GOING TO BE BETTER FOR YOU OF COURSE THAN MODERATELY HIGH TO HIGH ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION ON THE ORDER OF TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR OR MORE DRINKS PER WEEK I REALIZE THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS IT'S PROBABLY LOW TO MODERATE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION THAT IS PART OF THEIR STANDARD REPERTOIR AND I'M NOT HERE TO GIVE YOU JUSTIFICATION FOR DOING THAT NORMAGAN TO TELL YOU NOT TO DO THAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER PERHAPS HOWEVER THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT OUR DOCUMENTED FOR INSTANCE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF ALCOLL ON THE GOTMICROBIOM AND THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO BETTER SUPPORT YOUR GOT MICROBIO THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE STRESS SYSTEM THAT H P  AXIS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IN THE FACT THAT EVEN LOTOMODERATE LEVELS OF ALCOLL CONSUMPTION CAN INCREASE OUR LEVELS OF STRESS WHEN WE'RE NOT DRINKING AND TO THINK ABOUT ACQUIRING SOME TOOLS AND YOU GETTING SOME PROFICIENCY WITH TOOLS BEHAVIORAL OR OTHERWISE THAT CAN HELP YOU WITH STRESS MODULATION THAT DON'T INVOLVE ALCALL CONSUMPTION AGAIN THE POINT HERE IS TO ILLUSTRATE WHERE THE PROBLEMS LIE WITH ALCALL CONSUMPTION BUT ALSO WHAT I'AVE TRIED TO DO IS TO POINT YOU TO SOME RESOURCES THAT CAN HELP OFFSET SOME OF THOSE NEGATIVE EFFECTS WILL THEY OFFSET ALL THE EFFECTS I CAN'T SAY THAT FOR SHURE BUT CERTAINLY TAKING MEASURES TO OFFSET SOME OF THE NEGATIVEFECTS OF ANY ALCALL CONSUMPTION THAT YOU MIGHT BE HAVING YOUR DOING IS GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL TO YOU AND THOSE TOOLS AND PROTO CALLS ARE GOING TO BE HELTHD PROMOTING IN ANY CASE IF YOU'R LEARNING FROM END ER ENJOYING
